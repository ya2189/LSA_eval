twentieth
edition
to
washington
irving
this
book
the
chronicle
of
my
travels
through
lands
once
occupied
by
the
saracens
naturally
dedicates
itself
to
you
who
more
than
any
other
american
author
have
revived
the
traditions
restored
the
history
and
illustrated
the
character
of
that
brilliant
and
heroic
people
your
cordial
encouragement
confirmed
me
in
my
design
of
visiting
the
east
and
making
myself
familiar
with
oriental
life
and
though
i
bring
you
now
but
imperfect
returns
i
can
at
least
unite
with
you
in
admiration
of
a
field
so
rich
in
romantic
interest
and
indulge
the
hope
that
i
may
one
day
pluck
from
it
fruit
instead
of
blossoms
in
spain
i
came
upon
your
track
and
i
should
hesitate
to
exhibit
my
own
gleanings
where
you
have
harvested
were
it
not
for
the
belief
that
the
rapid
sketches
i
have
given
will
but
enhance
by
the
contrast
the
charm
of
your
finished
picture
bayard
taylor
preface
this
volume
comprises
the
second
portion
of
a
series
of
travels
of
which
the
journey
to
central
africa
already
published
is
the
first
part
i
left
home
intending
to
spend
a
winter
in
africa
and
to
return
during
the
following
summer
but
circumstances
afterwards
occurred
which
prolonged
my
wanderings
to
nearly
two
years
and
a
half
and
led
me
to
visit
many
remote
and
unexplored
portions
of
the
globe
to
describe
this
journey
in
a
single
work
would
embrace
too
many
incongruous
elements
to
say
nothing
of
its
great
length
and
as
it
falls
naturally
into
three
parts
or
episodes
of
very
distinct
character
i
have
judged
it
best
to
group
my
experiences
under
three
separate
heads
merely
indicating
the
links
which
connect
them
this
work
includes
my
travels
in
palestine
syria
asia
minor
sicily
and
spain
and
will
be
followed
by
a
third
and
concluding
volume
containing
my
adventures
in
india
china
the
islands
and
japan
although
many
of
the
letters
contained
in
this
volume
describe
beaten
tracks
of
travel
i
have
always
given
my
own
individual
impressions
and
may
claim
for
them
the
merit
of
entire
sincerity
the
journey
from
aleppo
to
constantinople
through
the
heart
of
asia
minor
illustrates
regions
rarely
traversed
by
tourists
and
will
no
doubt
be
new
to
most
of
my
readers
my
aim
throughout
the
work
has
been
to
give
correct
pictures
of
oriental
life
and
scenery
leaving
antiquarian
research
and
speculation
to
abler
hands
the
scholar
or
the
man
of
science
may
complain
with
reason
that
i
have
neglected
valuable
opportunities
for
adding
something
to
the
stock
of
human
knowledge
but
if
a
few
of
the
many
thousands
who
can
only
travel
by
their
firesides
should
find
my
pages
answer
the
purpose
of
a
series
of
cosmoramic
views
should
in
them
behold
with
a
clearer
inward
eye
the
hills
of
palestine
the
minarets
of
damascus
or
the
lonely
of
phrygia
should
feel
by
turns
something
of
the
inspiration
and
the
indolence
of
the
orient
i
shall
have
achieved
all
i
designed
and
more
than
i
can
justly
hope

in
quarantine
beyrout
everybody
has
heard
of
quarantine
but
in
our
favored
country
there
are
many
untravelled
persons
who
do
not
precisely
know
what
it
is
and
who
no
doubt
wonder
why
it
should
be
such
a
bugbear
to
travellers
in
the
orient
i
confess
i
am
still
somewhat
in
the
same
predicament
myself
although
i
have
already
been
hours
in
quarantine
but
as
a
peculiarity
of
the
place
is
that
one
can
do
nothing
however
good
a
will
he
has
i
propose
to
set
down
my
experiences
each
day
hoping
that
i
and
my
readers
may
obtain
some
insight
into
the
nature
of
quarantine
before
the
term
of
my
probation
is
over
i
left
alexandria
on
the
afternoon
of
the
in
company
with
carter
harrison
a
who
had
joined
me
in
cairo
for
the
tour
through
palestine
we
had
a
head
wind
and
rough
sea
and
i
remained
in
a
torpid
state
during
most
of
the
voyage
there
was
rain
the
second
night
but
when
the
clouds
cleared
away
yesterday
morning
we
were
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
lebanon
whose
summits
glittered
with
streaks
of
snow
the
lower
slopes
of
the
mountains
were
green
with
fields
and
forests
and
beyrout
when
we
ran
up
to
it
seemed
buried
almost
out
of
sight
in
the
foliage
of
its
mulberry
groves
the
town
is
built
along
the
northern
side
of
a
peninsula
which
projects
about
two
miles
from
the
main
line
of
the
coast
forming
a
road
for
vessels
in
half
an
hour
after
our
arrival
several
large
boats
came
alongside
and
we
were
told
to
get
our
baggage
in
order
and
embark
for
quarantine
the
time
necessary
to
purify
a
traveller
arriving
from
egypt
from
suspicion
of
the
plague
is
five
days
but
the
days
of
arrival
and
departure
are
counted
so
that
the
durance
amounts
to
but
three
full
days
the
captain
of
the
osiris
mustered
the
passengers
together
and
informed
them
that
each
one
would
be
obliged
to
pay
six
piastres
for
the
transportation
of
himself
and
his
baggage
two
heavy
lighters
are
now
drawn
up
to
the
foot
of
the
gangway
but
as
soon
as
the
first
box
tumbles
into
them
the
men
tumble
out
they
attach
the
craft
by
cables
to
two
smaller
boats
in
which
they
sit
to
tow
the
infected
loads
we
are
all
sent
down
together
jews
turks
and
christians
a
confused
pile
of
men
women
children
and
goods
a
little
boat
from
the
city
in
which
there
are
representatives
from
the
two
hotels
hovers
around
us
and
cards
are
thrown
to
us
the
zealous
agents
wish
to
supply
us
immediately
with
tables
beds
and
all
other
household
appliances
but
we
decline
their
help
until
we
arrive
at
the
mysterious
spot
at
last
we
float
off
two
lighters
full
of
infected
though
respectable
material
towed
by
oarsmen
of
most
scurvy
appearance
but
free
from
every
suspicion
of
taint
the
sea
is
still
rough
the
sun
is
hot
and
a
fat
jewess
becomes
an
italian
jew
rails
at
the
boatmen
ahead
in
the
neapolitan
patois
for
the
distance
is
long
the
quarantine
being
on
the
of
beyrout
we
see
the
rows
of
little
yellow
houses
on
the
cliff
and
with
great
apparent
risk
of
being
swept
upon
the
breakers
are
tugged
into
a
small
cove
where
there
is
a
nobody
is
there
to
receive
us
the
boatmen
jump
into
the
water
and
push
the
lighters
against
the
stone
stairs
while
we
unload
our
own
baggage
a
tin
cup
filled
with
is
placed
before
us
and
we
each
drop
six
piastres
into
it
for
money
strange
as
it
may
seem
is
infectious
by
this
time
the
have
had
notice
of
our
arrival
and
we
go
up
with
them
to
choose
our
habitations
there
are
several
rows
of
houses
overlooking
the
sea
each
containing
two
empty
rooms
to
be
had
for
a
hundred
piastres
but
a
square
dwelling
stands
apart
from
them
and
the
whole
of
it
may
be
had
for
thrice
that
sum
there
are
seven
frank
prisoners
and
we
take
it
for
ourselves
but
the
rooms
are
bare
the
kitchen
empty
and
we
learn
the
important
fact
that
quarantine
is
durance
vile
without
even
the
bread
and
water
the
guardiano
says
the
agents
of
the
hotel
are
at
the
gate
and
we
can
order
from
them
whatever
we
want
certainly
but
at
their
own
price
for
we
are
wholly
at
their
mercy
however
we
go
down
stairs
and
the
chief
officer
who
accompanies
us
gets
into
a
corner
as
we
pass
and
holds
a
stick
before
him
to
keep
us
off
he
is
now
clean
but
if
his
garments
brush
against
ours
he
is
lost
the
people
we
meet
in
the
grounds
step
aside
with
great
respect
to
let
us
pass
but
if
we
offer
them
our
hands
no
one
would
dare
to
touch
a
finger
tip
here
is
the
gate
a
double
screen
of
wire
with
an
interval
between
so
that
contact
is
impossible
there
is
a
crowd
of
individuals
outside
all
anxious
to
execute
commissions
among
them
is
the
agent
of
the
hotel
who
proposes
to
fill
our
bare
rooms
with
furniture
send
us
a
servant
and
cook
and
charge
us
the
same
as
if
we
lodged
with
him
the
bargain
is
closed
at
once
and
he
hurries
off
to
make
the
arrangements
it
is
now
four
and
the
bracing
air
of
the
headland
gives
a
terrible
appetite
to
those
of
us
who
like
me
have
been
and
fasting
for
hours
but
there
is
no
food
within
the
quarantine
except
a
patch
of
green
wheat
and
a
well
in
the
limestone
rock
we
two
americans
join
company
with
our
an
alexandrian
of
italian
parentage
who
has
come
to
beyrout
to
be
married
and
make
the
tour
of
our
territory
there
is
a
path
along
the
cliffs
overhanging
the
sea
with
glorious
views
of
lebanon
up
to
his
snowy
top
the
at
his
base
and
the
long
cape
whereon
the
city
lies
at
full
length
reposing
beside
the
waves
the
mahommedans
and
jews
in
companies
of
ten
to
save
expense
are
lodged
in
the
smaller
dwellings
where
they
have
already
aroused
millions
of
fleas
from
their
state
of
torpid
expectancy
we
return
and
take
a
survey
of
our
companions
in
the
pavilion
a
french
woman
with
two
ugly
and
peevish
children
one
at
the
breast
in
the
next
room
and
three
french
gentlemen
in
the
other
a
merchant
a
young
man
with
hair
of
extraordinary
length
and
a
or
and
cynical
the
first
is
a
gentleman
in
every
sense
of
the
word
the
latter
endurable
but
the
young
absalom
is
my
aversion
i
am
subject
to
involuntary
likings
and
dislikings
for
which
i
can
give
no
reason
and
though
the
man
may
be
in
every
way
amiable
his
presence
is
very
distasteful
to
me
we
take
a
pipe
of
consolation
but
it
only
whets
our
appetites
we
give
up
our
promenade
for
exercise
is
still
worse
and
at
last
the
sun
goes
down
and
yet
no
sign
of
dinner
our
pavilion
becomes
a
tower
of
famine
and
the
italian
recites
dante
finally
a
strange
face
appears
at
the
door
by
apicius
it
is
a
servant
from
the
hotel
with
iron
bedsteads
and
some
large
chests
which
breathe
an
odor
of
the
commissary
department
we
go
stealthily
down
to
the
kitchen
and
watch
the
unpacking
our
dinner
is
there
sure
enough
but
alas
it
is
not
yet
cooked
patience
is
no
more
my
companion
manages
to
filch
a
raw
onion
and
a
crust
of
bread
which
we
share
and
roll
under
our
tongues
as
a
sweet
morsel
and
it
gives
us
strength
for
another
hour
the
greek
dragoman
and
cook
who
are
sent
into
quarantine
for
our
sakes
take
compassion
on
us
the
fires
are
kindled
in
the
cold
furnaces
savory
steams
creep
up
the
stairs
the
preparations
increase
and
finally
climax
in
the
rapturous
announcement
messieurs
dinner
is
ready
the
soup
is
liquified
bliss
the
are
de
and
as
for
that
broad
dish
of
syrian
larks
heaven
forgive
us
the
regret
that
more
songs
had
not
been
silenced
for
our
sake
the
meal
is
all
nectar
and
ambrosia
and
now
filled
and
contented
we
subside
into
sleep
on
comfortable
couches
so
closes
the
first
day
of
our
incarceration
this
morning
dawned
clear
and
beautiful
lebanon
except
his
snowy
crest
was
wrapped
in
the
early
shadows
but
the
mediterranean
gleamed
like
a
shield
of
sapphire
and
beyrout
sculptured
against
the
background
of
its
mulberry
groves
was
glorified
beyond
all
other
cities
the
turf
around
our
pavilion
fairly
blazed
with
the
splendor
of
the
yellow
daisies
and
crimson
poppies
that
stud
it
i
was
satisfied
with
what
i
saw
and
felt
no
wish
to
leave
quarantine
our
italian
friend
however
is
more
impatient
his
betrothed
came
early
to
see
him
and
we
were
edified
by
the
great
alacrity
with
which
he
hastened
to
the
grate
to
renew
his
vows
at
two
yards
distance
from
her
in
the
meantime
i
went
down
to
the
turkish
houses
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
a
singular
character
i
met
on
board
the
steamer
he
is
a
negro
of
six
feet
four
dressed
in
a
long
scarlet
robe
his
name
is
mahommed
senoosee
and
he
is
a
or
holy
man
from
timbuctoo
he
has
been
two
years
absent
from
home
on
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
and
medina
and
is
now
on
his
way
to
jerusalem
and
damascus
he
has
travelled
extensively
in
all
parts
of
central
africa
from
to
ashantee
and
professes
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
sultans
of
houssa
and
bornou
he
has
even
been
in
the
great
kingdom
of
waday
which
has
never
been
explored
by
europeans
and
as
far
south
as
iola
the
capital
of
adamowa
of
the
correctness
of
his
narrations
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
as
they
correspond
geographically
with
all
that
we
know
of
the
interior
of
africa
in
answer
to
my
question
whether
a
european
might
safely
make
the
same
tour
he
replied
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
provided
he
was
accompanied
by
a
native
and
he
offered
to
take
me
even
to
timbuctoo
if
i
would
return
with
him
he
was
very
curious
to
obtain
information
about
america
and
made
notes
of
all
that
i
told
him
in
the
quaint
character
used
by
the
mughrebbins
or
arabs
of
the
west
which
has
considerable
resemblance
to
the
ancient
cufic
he
wishes
to
join
company
with
me
for
the
journey
to
jerusalem
and
perhaps
i
shall
accept
him
as
quarantine
is
a
sort
of
limbo
without
the
pale
of
civilized
society
we
have
no
church
service
we
have
done
the
best
we
could
however
in
sending
one
of
the
outside
dragomen
to
purchase
a
bible
in
which
we
succeeded
he
brought
us
a
very
handsome
copy
printed
by
the
american
bible
society
in
new
york
i
tried
vainly
in
cairo
and
alexandria
to
find
a
missionary
who
would
supply
my
heathenish
destitution
of
the
sacred
writings
for
i
had
reached
the
east
through
austria
where
they
are
prohibited
and
to
travel
through
palestine
without
them
would
be
like
sailing
without
pilot
or
compass
it
gives
a
most
impressive
reality
to
solomon
house
of
the
forest
of
lebanon
when
you
can
look
up
from
the
page
to
those
very
forests
and
those
grand
mountains
excellent
with
the
cedars
seeing
the
holy
man
of
timbuctoo
praying
with
his
face
towards
mecca
i
went
down
to
him
and
we
conversed
for
a
long
time
on
religious
matters
he
is
tolerably
well
informed
having
read
the
books
of
moses
and
the
psalms
of
david
but
like
all
mahommedans
his
ideas
of
religion
consist
mainly
of
forms
and
its
reward
is
a
sensual
paradise
the
more
intelligent
of
the
moslems
give
a
spiritual
interpretation
to
the
nature
of
the
heaven
promised
by
the
prophet
and
i
have
heard
several
openly
confess
their
disbelief
in
the
seventy
houries
and
the
palaces
of
pearl
and
emerald
shekh
mahommed
senoosee
scarcely
ever
utters
a
sentence
in
which
is
not
the
word
allah
and
la
illah
il
allah
is
repeated
at
least
every
five
minutes
those
of
his
class
consider
that
there
is
a
peculiar
merit
in
the
repetition
of
the
names
and
attributes
of
god
they
utterly
reject
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
which
they
believe
implies
a
sort
of
partnership
or
to
use
their
own
words
and
declare
that
all
who
accept
it
are
hopelessly
damned
to
deny
prophetship
would
excite
a
violent
antagonism
and
i
content
myself
with
making
them
acknowledge
that
god
is
greater
than
all
prophets
or
apostles
and
that
there
is
but
one
god
for
all
the
human
race
i
have
never
yet
encountered
that
bitter
spirit
of
bigotry
which
is
so
frequently
ascribed
to
them
but
on
the
contrary
fully
as
great
a
tolerance
as
they
would
find
exhibited
towards
them
by
most
of
the
christian
sects
this
morning
a
paper
was
sent
to
us
on
which
we
were
requested
to
write
our
names
ages
professions
and
places
of
nativity
we
conjectured
that
we
were
subjected
to
the
suspicion
of
political
as
well
as
physical
taint
but
happily
this
was
not
the
case
i
registered
myself
as
a
the
french
as
and
when
it
came
to
the
woman
turn
absalom
who
is
a
partisan
of
female
progress
wished
to
give
her
the
same
profession
as
her
husband
a
machinist
but
she
declared
that
her
only
profession
was
that
of
a
married
woman
and
she
was
so
inscribed
her
peevish
boy
rejoiced
in
the
title
of
or
weeper
and
the
infant
as
or
sucker
while
this
was
going
on
the
guardiano
of
our
room
came
in
very
mysteriously
and
beckoned
to
my
companion
saying
that
mademoiselle
was
at
the
gate
but
it
was
the
italian
who
was
wanted
and
again
from
the
little
window
of
our
pavilion
we
watched
his
hurried
progress
over
the
lawn
no
sooner
had
she
departed
than
he
took
his
pocket
telescope
slowly
sweeping
the
circuit
of
the
bay
as
she
drew
nearer
and
nearer
beyrout
he
has
succeeded
in
distinguishing
among
the
mass
of
buildings
the
top
of
the
house
in
which
she
lives
but
alas
it
is
one
story
too
low
and
his
patient
espial
has
only
been
rewarded
by
the
sight
of
some
cats
promenading
on
the
roof
i
have
succeeded
in
obtaining
some
further
particulars
in
relation
to
quarantine
on
the
night
of
our
arrival
as
we
were
about
getting
into
our
beds
a
sudden
and
horrible
gush
of
brimstone
vapor
came
up
stairs
and
we
all
fell
to
coughing
like
patients
in
a
pulmonary
hospital
the
odor
increased
till
we
were
obliged
to
open
the
windows
and
sit
beside
them
in
order
to
breathe
comfortably
this
was
the
preparatory
fumigation
in
order
to
remove
the
ranker
seeds
of
plague
after
which
the
milder
symptoms
will
of
themselves
vanish
in
the
pure
air
of
the
place
several
times
a
day
we
are
stunned
and
overwhelmed
with
the
cracked
brays
of
three
discordant
trumpets
as
grating
and
doleful
as
the
last
gasps
of
a
dying
donkey
at
first
i
supposed
the
object
of
this
was
to
give
a
greater
agitation
to
the
air
and
separate
and
shake
down
the
noxious
exhalations
we
emit
but
since
i
was
informed
that
the
soldiers
outside
would
shoot
us
in
case
we
attempted
to
escape
i
have
concluded
that
the
sound
is
meant
to
alarm
us
and
prevent
our
approaching
too
near
the
walls
on
inquiring
of
our
guardiano
whether
the
wheat
growing
within
the
grounds
was
subject
to
quarantine
he
informed
me
that
it
did
not
ecovey
infection
and
that
three
old
geese
who
walked
out
past
the
guard
with
impunity
were
free
to
go
and
come
as
they
had
never
been
known
to
have
the
plague
yesterday
evening
the
medical
attendant
a
polish
physician
came
in
to
inspect
us
but
he
made
a
very
hasty
review
looking
down
on
us
from
the
top
of
a
high
horse
eureka
the
whole
thing
is
explained
talking
to
day
with
the
guardiano
he
happened
to
mention
that
he
had
been
three
years
in
quarantine
keeping
watch
over
infected
travellers
what
said
i
you
have
been
sick
three
years
oh
no
he
replied
i
have
never
been
sick
at
all
but
are
not
people
sick
in
quarantine
he
exclaimed
they
are
always
in
better
health
than
the
people
outside
what
is
quarantine
for
then
i
persisted
what
is
it
for
he
repeated
with
a
pause
of
blank
amazement
at
my
ignorance
why
to
get
money
from
the
travellers
indiscreet
guardiano
it
were
better
to
suppose
ourselves
under
suspicion
of
the
plague
than
to
have
such
an
explanation
of
the
mystery
yet
in
spite
of
the
unpalatable
knowledge
i
almost
regret
that
this
is
our
last
day
in
the
establishment
the
air
is
so
pure
and
bracing
the
views
from
our
windows
so
magnificent
the
colonized
branch
of
the
beyrout
hotel
so
comfortable
that
i
am
content
to
enjoy
this
pleasant
idleness
the
more
pleasant
since
being
involuntary
it
is
no
weight
on
the
conscience
i
look
up
to
the
maronite
villages
perched
on
the
slopes
of
lebanon
with
scarce
a
wish
to
climb
to
them
or
turning
to
the
sparkling
mediterranean
view
the
speronara
sail
of
snowy
hue
whitening
and
brightening
on
that
field
of
blue
and
have
none
of
that
unrest
which
the
sight
of
a
vessel
in
motion
suggests
my
friend
from
timbuctoo
came
up
to
have
another
talk
he
was
curious
to
know
the
object
of
my
travels
and
as
he
would
not
have
comprehended
the
exact
truth
i
was
obliged
to
convey
it
to
him
through
the
medium
of
fiction
i
informed
him
that
i
had
been
dispatched
by
the
sultan
of
my
country
to
obtain
information
of
the
countries
of
africa
that
i
wrote
in
a
book
accounts
of
everything
i
saw
and
on
my
return
would
present
this
book
to
the
sultan
who
would
reward
me
with
a
high
rank
perhaps
even
that
of
grand
vizier
the
orientals
deal
largely
in
hyperbole
and
scatter
numbers
and
values
with
the
most
reckless
profusion
the
arabic
like
the
hebrew
its
sister
tongue
and
other
old
original
tongues
of
man
is
a
language
of
roots
and
abounds
with
the
boldest
metaphors
now
exaggeration
is
but
the
imperfect
form
of
metaphor
the
expression
is
always
a
splendid
amplification
of
the
simple
fact
like
skilful
archers
in
order
to
hit
the
mark
they
aim
above
it
when
you
have
once
learned
his
standard
of
truth
you
can
readily
gauge
an
arab
expressions
and
regulate
your
own
accordingly
but
whenever
i
have
attempted
to
strike
the
myself
i
generally
found
that
it
was
below
rather
than
above
the
oriental
pitch
the
shekh
had
already
informed
me
that
the
king
of
ashantee
whom
he
had
visited
possessed
houses
full
of
gold
and
that
the
sultan
of
houssa
had
seventy
thousand
horses
always
standing
saddled
before
his
palace
in
order
that
he
might
take
his
choice
when
he
wished
to
ride
out
by
this
he
did
not
mean
that
the
facts
were
precisely
so
but
only
that
the
king
was
very
rich
and
the
sultan
had
a
great
many
horses
in
order
to
give
the
shekh
an
idea
of
the
great
wealth
and
power
of
the
american
nation
i
was
obliged
to
adopt
the
same
plan
i
told
him
therefore
that
our
country
was
two
years
journey
in
extent
that
the
treasury
consisted
of
four
thousand
houses
filled
to
the
roof
with
gold
and
that
two
hundred
thousand
soldiers
on
horseback
kept
continual
guard
around
sultan
fillmore
palace
he
received
these
tremendous
statements
with
the
utmost
serenity
and
satisfaction
carefully
writing
them
in
his
book
together
with
the
name
of
sultan
fillmore
whose
fame
has
ere
this
reached
the
remote
regions
of
timbuctoo
the
shekh
moreover
had
the
desire
of
visiting
england
and
wished
me
to
give
him
a
letter
to
the
english
sultan
this
rather
exceeded
my
powers
but
i
wrote
a
simple
certificate
explaining
who
he
was
and
whence
he
came
which
i
sealed
with
an
immense
display
of
wax
and
gave
him
in
return
he
wrote
his
name
in
my
book
in
the
mughrebbin
character
adding
the
sentence
there
is
no
god
but
god
this
evening
the
forbidden
subject
of
politics
crept
into
our
quiet
community
and
the
result
was
an
explosive
contention
which
drowned
even
the
braying
of
the
agonizing
trumpets
outside
the
gentlemanly
frenchman
is
a
sensible
and
consistent
republican
the
old
a
violent
monarchist
while
absalom
as
i
might
have
foreseen
is
a
red
of
the
schools
of
proudhon
and
considerant
the
first
predicted
a
republic
in
france
the
second
a
monarchy
in
america
and
the
last
was
in
favor
of
a
general
and
total
demolition
of
all
existing
systems
of
course
with
such
elements
anything
like
a
serious
discussion
was
impossible
and
as
in
most
french
debates
it
ended
in
a
bewildering
confusion
of
cries
and
gesticulations
in
the
midst
of
it
i
was
struck
by
the
cordiality
with
which
the
monarchist
and
the
socialist
united
in
their
denunciations
of
england
and
the
english
laws
as
they
sat
side
by
side
pouring
out
anathemas
against
perfide
albion
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
comme
les
extrêmes
se
this
turned
the
whole
current
of
their
wrath
against
me
and
i
was
glad
to
make
a
hasty
retreat
the
physician
again
visited
us
to
promise
a
release
morning
he
looked
us
all
in
the
faces
to
be
certain
that
there
were
no
signs
of
pestilence
and
politely
regretted
that
he
could
not
offer
us
his
hand
the
husband
of
the
married
woman
also
came
and
relieved
the
other
gentlemen
from
the
charge
of
the
weeper
he
was
a
stout
ruddy
provençal
in
a
white
blouse
and
i
commiserated
him
sincerely
for
having
such
a
disagreeable
wife
being
the
last
of
our
imprisonment
we
have
received
many
tokens
of
attention
from
dragomen
who
have
sent
their
papers
through
the
grate
to
us
to
be
returned
after
our
liberation
they
are
not
very
prepossessing
specimens
of
their
class
with
the
exception
of
yusef
badra
who
brings
a
recommendation
from
my
friend
ross
browne
yusef
is
a
handsome
dashing
fellow
with
something
of
the
dandy
in
his
dress
and
air
but
he
has
a
fine
clear
sparkling
eye
with
just
enough
of
the
devil
in
it
to
make
him
attractive
i
think
however
that
the
greek
dragoman
who
has
been
our
companion
in
quarantine
will
carry
the
day
he
is
by
birth
a
boeotian
but
now
a
citizen
of
athens
and
calls
himself
françois
vitalis
he
speaks
french
german
and
italian
besides
arabic
and
turkish
and
as
he
has
been
for
twelve
or
fifteen
years
vibrating
between
europe
and
the
east
he
must
by
this
time
have
amassed
sufficient
experience
to
answer
the
needs
of
travellers
like
ourselves
he
has
not
asked
us
for
the
place
which
displays
so
much
penetration
on
his
part
that
we
shall
end
by
offering
it
to
him
perhaps
he
is
content
to
rest
his
claims
upon
the
memory
of
our
first
quarantine
dinner
if
so
the
odors
of
the
cutlets
and
larks
even
of
the
raw
onion
which
we
remember
with
tears
shall
not
plead
his
cause
in
vain
beyrout
out
of
quarantine
the
handsome
greek
diamanti
one
of
the
proprietors
of
the
hotel
de
belle
vue
was
on
hand
bright
and
early
yesterday
morning
to
welcome
us
out
of
quarantine
the
gates
were
thrown
wide
and
forth
we
issued
between
two
files
of
soldiers
rejoicing
in
our
purification
we
walked
through
mulberry
orchards
to
the
town
and
through
its
steep
and
crooked
streets
to
the
hotel
which
stands
beyond
near
the
extremity
of
the
cape
or
ras
beyrout
the
town
is
small
but
has
an
active
population
and
a
larger
commerce
than
any
other
port
in
syria
the
anchorage
however
is
an
open
road
and
in
stormy
weather
it
is
impossible
for
a
boat
to
land
there
are
two
picturesque
old
castles
on
some
rocks
near
the
shore
but
they
were
almost
destroyed
by
the
english
bombardment
in
i
noticed
two
or
three
granite
columns
now
used
as
the
lintels
of
some
of
the
arched
ways
in
the
streets
and
other
fragments
of
old
masonry

only
remains

the
ancient
berytus
our
time
since
our
release
has
been
occupied

preparations
for
the
journey

jerusalem
we
have
taken
françois

dragoman
and
our

that
the

to
be

are
slow

beasts

can

in
the
creatures
in
consideration
of
the
steady
persevering
energy
the
cheerfulness
and
even
enthusiasm
with
which
they
perform
their
duties
they
seem
to
be
conscious
that
they
are
doing
well
and
to
take
a
delight
in
the
consciousness
one
of
them
has
a
band
of
white
shells
around
his
neck
fastened
with
a
tassel
and
two
large
blue
beads
and
you
need
but
look
at
him
to
see
that
he
is
aware
how
becoming
it
is
he
thinks
it
was
given
to
him
for
good
conduct
and
is
doing
his
best
to
merit
another
the
little
donkey
is
a
still
more
original
animal
he
is
a
practical
humorist
full
of
perverse
tricks
but
all
intended
for
effect
and
without
a
particle
of
malice
he
generally
walks
behind
running
off
to
one
side
or
the
other
to
crop
a
mouthful
of
grass
but
no
sooner
does
dervish
attempt
to
mount
him
than
he
sets
off
at
full
gallop
and
takes
the
lead
of
the
caravan
after
having
performed
one
of
his
feats
he
turns
around
with
a
droll
glance
at
us
as
much
as
to
say
did
you
see
that
if
we
had
not
been
present
most
assuredly
he
would
never
have
done
it
i
can
imagine
him
after
his
return
to
beyrout
relating
his
adventures
to
a
company
of
who
every
now
and
then
burst
into
tremendous
brays
at
some
of
his
irresistible
dry
sayings
i
persuaded
harrison
to
adopt
the
oriental
costume
which
from
five
months
wear
in
africa
i
greatly
preferred
to
the
frank
we
therefore
rode
out
of
beyrout
as
a
pair
of
syrian
beys
while
françois
with
his
belt
sabre
and
pistols
had
much
the
aspect
of
a
greek
brigand
the
road
crosses
the
hill
behind
the
city
between
the
forest
of
pines
and
a
long
tract
of
red
next
the
sea
it
was
a
lovely
morning
not
too
bright
and
hot
for
light
fleecy
vapors
hung
along
the
sides
of
lebanon
beyond
the
mulberry
orchards
we
entered
on
wild
tracts
covered
with
a
bewildering
maze
of
blossoms
the
and
stony
shelves
of
soil
overhanging
the
sea
fairly
blazed
with
the
brilliant
dots
of
color
which
were
rained
upon
them
the
pink
the
broom
the
poppy
the
speedwell
the
lupin
that
beautiful
variety
of
the
cyclamen
called
by
the
syrians
cock
o
the
mountain
and
a
number
of
unknown
plants
dazzled
the
eye
with
their
profusion
and
loaded
the
air
with
fragrance
as
rare
as
it
was
unfailing
here
and
there
clear
swift
rivulets
came
down
from
lebanon
coursing
their
way
between
thickets
of
blooming
oleanders
just
before
crossing
the
little
river
damoor
françois
pointed
out
on
one
of
the
distant
heights
the
residence
of
the
late
lady
hester
stanhope
during
the
afternoon
we
crossed
several
offshoots
of
the
lebanon
by
paths
incredibly
steep
and
stony
and
towards
evening
reached
saïda
the
ancient
sidon
where
we
obtained
permission
to
pitch
our
tent
in
a
garden
the
town
is
built
on
a
narrow
point
of
land
jutting
out
from
the
centre
of
a
bay
or
curve
in
the
coast
and
contains
about
five
thousand
inhabitants
it
is
a
quiet
sleepy
sort
of
a
place
and
contains
nothing
of
the
old
sidon
except
a
few
stones
and
the
fragments
of
a
mole
extending
into
the
sea
the
fortress
in
the
water
and
the
citadel
are
remnants
of
venitian
sway
the
clouds
gathered
after
nightfall
and
occasionally
there
was
a
dash
of
rain
on
our
tent
but
i
heard
it
with
the
same
quiet
happiness
as
when
in
boyhood
sleeping
beneath
the
rafters
i
have
heard
the
rain
beating
all
night
upon
the
roof
i
breathed
the
sweet
breath
of
the
grasses
whereon
my
carpet
was
spread
and
old
mother
earth
welcoming
me
back
to
her
bosom
cradled
me
into
calm
and
refreshing
sleep
there
is
no
rest
more
grateful
than
that
which
we
take
on
the
turf
or
the
sand
except
the
rest
below
it
we
rose
in
a
dark
and
cloudy
morning
and
continued
our
way
between
fields
of
barley
completely
stained
with
the
bloody
hue
of
the
poppy
and
meadows
turned
into
golden
mosaic
by
a
brilliant
yellow
daisy
until
noon
our
road
was
over
a
region
of
alternate
meadow
land
and
gentle
though
stony
elevations
making
out
from
lebanon
we
met
continually
with
indications
of
ancient
power
and
prosperity
the
ground
was
strewn
with
hewn
blocks
and
the
foundations
of
buildings
remain
in
many
places
broken
sarcophagi
lie
in
grass
and
the
gray
rocks
of
the
hills
are
pierced
with
tombs
the
soil
though
stony
appeared
to
be
naturally
fertile
and
the
crops
of
wheat
barley
and
lentils
were
very
flourishing
after
rounding
the
promontory
which
forms
the
southern
boundary
of
the
gulf
of
sidon
we
rode
for
an
hour
or
two
over
a
plain
near
the
sea
and
then
came
down
to
a
valley
which
ran
up
among
the
hills
terminating
in
a
natural
amphitheatre
an
ancient
barrow
or
tumulus
nobody
knows
of
whom
stands
near
the
sea
during
the
day
i
noticed
two
charming
little
pictures
one
a
fountain
gushing
into
a
broad
square
basin
of
masonry
shaded
by
three
branching
cypresses
two
turks
sat
on
its
edge
eating
their
bread
and
curdled
milk
while
their
horses
drank
out
of
the
stone
trough
below
the
other
an
old
mahommedan
with
a
green
turban
and
white
robe
seated
at
the
foot
of
a
majestic
sycamore
over
the
high
bank
of
a
stream
that
tumbled
down
its
bed
of
white
marble
rock
to
the
sea
the
plain
back
of
the
narrow
sandy
promontory
on
which
the
modern
soor
is
built
is
a
rich
black
loam
which
a
little
proper
culture
would
turn
into
a
very
garden
it
helped
me
to
account
for
the
wealth
of
ancient
tyre
the
approach
to
the
town
along
a
beach
on
which
the
surf
broke
with
a
continuous
roar
with
the
wreck
of
a
greek
vessel
in
the
foreground
and
a
stormy
sky
behind
was
very
striking
it
was
a
wild
bleak
picture
the
white
minarets
of
the
town
standing
out
spectrally
against
the
clouds
we
rode
up
the
back
of
the
town
and
selected
a
good
among
the
ruins
of
tyre
near
us
there
was
an
ancient
square
building
now
used
as
a
cistern
and
filled
with
excellent
fresh
water
the
surf
roared
tremendously
on
the
rocks
on
either
hand
and
the
boom
of
the
more
distant
breakers
came
to
my
ear
like
the
wind
in
a
pine
forest
the
remains
of
the
ancient
are
still
to
be
traced
for
the
entire
circuit
of
the
city
and
the
heavy
surf
breaks
upon
piles
of
shattered
granite
columns
along
a
sort
of
mole
protecting
an
inner
harbor
on
the
north
side
are
great
numbers
of
these
columns
i
counted
fifteen
in
one
group
some
of
them
fine
red
granite
and
some
of
the
marble
of
lebanon
the
remains
of
the
pharos
and
the
fortresses
strengthening
the
were
pointed
out
by
the
syrian
who
accompanied
us
as
a
guide
but
his
faith
was
a
little
stronger
than
mine
he
even
showed
us
the
ruins
of
the
jetty
built
by
alexander
by
means
of
which
the
ancient
city
then
insulated
by
the
sea
was
taken
the
remains
of
the
causeway
gradually
formed
the
promontory
by
which
the
place
is
now
connected
with
the
main
land
these
are
the
principal
indications
of
tyre
above
ground
but
the
guide
informed
us
that
the
arabs
in
digging
among
the
for
the
stones
of
the
old
buildings
which
they
quarry
out
and
ship
to
beyrout
come
upon
chambers
pillars
arches
and
other
objects
the
tyrian
purple
is
still
furnished
by
a
muscle
found
upon
the
coast
but
tyre
is
now
only
noted
for
its
tobacco
and
i
saw
many
of
the
latter
lying
in
the
streets
of
the
town
and
an
arab
was
selling
a
quantity
at
auction
in
the
square
as
we
passed
they
are
cut
out
from
a
species
of
dark
volcanic
rock
by
the
bedouins
of
the
mountains
there
were
half
a
dozen
small
coasting
vessels
lying
in
the
road
but
the
old
harbors
are
entirely
destroyed
isaiah
prophecy
is
literally
fulfilled
howl
ye
ships
of
tarshish
for
it
is
laid
waste
so
that
there
is
no
house
no
entering
in
on
returning
from
our
ramble
we
passed
the
house
of
the
governor
daood
agha
who
was
dispensing
justice
in
regard
to
a
lawsuit
then
before
him
he
asked
us
to
stop
and
take
coffee
and
received
us
with
much
grace
and
dignity
as
we
rose
to
leave
a
slave
brought
me
a
large
bunch
of
choice
flowers
from
his
garden
we
set
out
from
tyre
at
an
early
hour
and
rode
along
the
beach
around
the
head
of
the
bay
to
the
the
ancient
promontorium
album
the
morning
was
wild
and
cloudy
with
gleams
of
sunshine
that
flashed
out
over
the
dark
violet
gloom
of
the
sea
the
surf
was
magnificent
rolling
up
in
grand
billows
which
broke
and
formed
again
till
the
last
of
the
long
falling
fringes
of
snow
slid
seething
up
the
sand
something
of
ancient
power
was
in
their
shock
and
roar
and
every
great
wave
that
plunged
and
drew
back
again
called
in
its
solemn
bass
where
are
the
ships
of
tyre
where
are
the
ships
of
tyre
i
looked
back
on
the
city
which
stood
advanced
far
into
the
sea
her
feet
bathed
in
thunderous
spray
by
and
by
the
clouds
cleared
away
the
sun
came
out
bold
and
bright
and
our
road
left
the
beach
for
a
meadowy
plain
crossed
by
fresh
streams
and
sown
with
an
inexhaustible
wealth
of
flowers
through
thickets
of
myrtle
and
mastic
around
which
the
rue
and
lavender
grew
in
dense
clusters
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
began
ascending
the
celebrated
ladder
of
tyre
the
road
is
so
steep
as
to
resemble
a
staircase
and
climbs
along
the
side
of
the
promontory
hanging
over
precipices
of
naked
white
rock
in
some
places
three
hundred
feet
in
height
the
mountain
is
a
mass
of
magnesian
limestone
with
occasional
beds
of
marble
the
surf
has
worn
its
foot
into
hollow
caverns
into
which
the
sea
rushes
with
a
dull
heavy
boom
like
distant
thunder
the
sides
are
covered
with
thickets
of
broom
myrtle
arbutus
ilex
mastic
and
laurel
overgrown
with
woodbine
and
interspersed
with
patches
of
sage
lavender
hyssop
wild
thyme
and
rue
the
whole
mountain
is
a
heap
of
balm
a
bundle
of
sweet
spices
our
horses
hoofs
clattered
up
and
down
the
rounds
of
the
ladder
and
we
looked
our
last
on
tyre
fading
away
behind
the
white
hem
of
the
breakers
as
we
turned
the
point
of
the
promontory
another
cove
of
the
followed
terminated
by
the
cape
of
nakhura
the
northern
point
of
the
bay
of
acre
we
rode
along
a
stony
way
between
fields
of
wheat
and
barley
blotted
almost
out
of
sight
by
showers
of
scarlet
poppies
and
yellow
chrysanthemums
there
were
frequent
ruins
fragments
of
sarcophagi
foundations
of
houses
and
about
half
way
between
the
two
capes
the
mounds
of
we
stopped
at
a
khan
and
breakfasted
under
a
magnificent
olive
tree
while
two
boys
tended
our
horses
to
see
that
they
ate
only
the
edges
of
the
wheat
field
below
the
house
were
two
large
cypresses
and
on
a
little
tongue
of
land
the
ruins
of
one
of
those
square
towers
of
the
corsairs
which
line
all
this
coast
the
intense
blue
of
the
sea
seen
close
at
hand
over
a
broad
field
of
goldening
wheat
formed
a
dazzling
and
superb
contrast
of
color
early
in
the
afternoon
we
climbed
the
ras
nakhura
not
so
bold
and
grand
though
quite
as
flowery
a
steep
as
the
promontorium
album
we
had
been
jogging
half
an
hour
over
its
uneven
summit
when
the
side
suddenly
fell
away
below
us
and
we
saw
the
whole
of
the
great
gulf
and
plain
of
acre
backed
by
the
long
ridge
of
mount
carmel
behind
the
sea
which
makes
a
deep
indentation
in
the
line
of
the
coast
extended
the
plain
bounded
on
the
east
at
two
leagues
distance
by
a
range
of
hills
covered
with
luxuriant
olive
groves
and
still
higher
by
the
distant
mountains
of
galilee
the
fortifications
of
acre
were
visible
on
a
slight
promontory
near
the
middle
of
the
gulf
from
our
feet
the
line
of
foamy
surf
extended
for
miles
along
the
red
till
it
finally
became
like
a
on
the
edge
of
the
field
of
blue
we
rode
down
the
mountain
and
continued
our
journey
over
the
plain
of
esdraelon
a
picture
of
summer
luxuriance
and
bloom
the
waves
of
wheat
and
barley
rolled
away
from
our
path
to
the
distant
olive
orchards
here
the
water
gushed
from
a
stone
fountain
and
flowed
into
a
pool
around
which
the
syrian
women
were
washing
their
garments
there
a
garden
of
orange
lemon
fig
and
pomegranate
trees
in
blossom
was
a
spring
of
sweet
odors
which
overflowed
the
whole
land
we
rode
into
some
of
these
forests
for
they
were
no
less
and
finally
pitched
our
tent
in
one
of
them
belonging
to
the
palace
of
the
former
abdallah
pasha
within
a
mile
of
acre
the
old
saracen
aqueduct
which
still
conveys
water
to
the
town
overhung
our
tent
for
an
hour
before
reaching
our
destination
we
had
seen
it
on
the
left
crossing
the
hollows
on
light
stone
arches
in
one
place
i
counted
and
in
another
one
hundred
and
three
of
these
arches
some
of
which
were
fifty
feet
high
our
camp
was
a
charming
place
a
nest
of
deep
herbage
under
two
enormous
and
surrounded
by
a
balmy
grove
of
orange
and
citron
it
was
doubly
beautiful
when
the
long
line
of
the
aqueduct
was
lit
up
by
the
moon
and
the
orange
trees
became
mounds
of
ambrosial
darkness
in
the
morning
we
rode
to
acre
the
fortifications
of
which
have
been
restored
on
the
a
ponderous
double
gateway
of
stone
admitted
us
into
the
city
through
what
was
once
apparently
the
of
a
fortress
the
streets
of
the
town
are
narrow
terribly
rough
and
very
dirty
but
the
bazaars
are
extensive
and
well
stocked
the
principal
mosque
whose
heavy
dome
is
visible
at
some
distance
from
the
city
is
surrounded
with
a
garden
enclosed
by
a
pillared
corridor
paved
with
marble
all
the
houses
of
the
city
are
built
in
the
most
massive
style
of
hard
gray
limestone
or
marble
and
this
circumstance
alone
prevented
their
complete
destruction
during
the
english
bombardment
in
the
marks
of
the
shells
are
everywhere
seen
and
the
upper
parts
of
the
lofty
buildings
are
completely
riddled
with
some
of
which
remain
embedded
in
the
stone
we
made
a
rapid
tour
of
the
town
on
horseback
followed
by
the
curious
glances
of
the
people
who
were
in
doubt
whether
to
consider
us
turks
or
franks
there
were
a
dozen
vessels
in
the
harbor
which
is
considered
the
best
in
syria
the
had
gone
on
so
we
galloped
after
them
along
the
hard
beach
around
the
head
of
the
bay
it
was
a
brilliant
morning
a
delicious
breeze
came
to
us
over
the
flowery
plain
of
esdraelon
the
sea
on
our
right
shone
blue
and
purple
and
and
black
as
the
shadows
or
sunshine
crossed
it
and
only
the
long
lines
of
roaring
foam
for
ever
changing
in
form
did
not
vary
in
hue
a
fisherman
stood
on
the
beach
in
a
statuesque
attitude
his
handsome
bare
legs
bathed
in
the
frothy
swells
a
bag
of
fish
hanging
from
his
shoulder
and
the
large
square
net
with
its
sinkers
of
lead
in
his
right
hand
ready
for
a
cast
he
had
good
luck
for
the
waves
brought
up
plenty
of
large
fish
and
cast
them
at
our
feet
leaving
them
to
struggle
back
into
the
treacherous
brine
between
acre
and
haifa
we
passed
six
or
eight
wrecks
mostly
of
small
trading
vessels
some
were
half
buried
in
sand
some
so
old
and
mossy
that
they
were
fast
rotting
away
while
a
few
had
been
recently
hurled
there
as
we
rounded
the
deep
curve
of
the
bay
and
approached
the
line
of
girding
the
foot
of
mount
carmel
haifa
with
its
wall
and
saracenic
town
in
ruin
on
the
hill
above
grew
more
clear
and
bright
in
the
sun
while
acre
dipped
into
the
blue
of
the
mediterranean
the
town
of
haifa
the
ancient
caiapha
is
small
dirty
and
beggarly
looking
but
it
has
some
commerce
sharing
the
trade
of
acre
in
the
productions
of
syria
it
was
sunday
and
all
the
consular
flags
were
flying
it
was
an
unexpected
delight
to
find
the
american
colors
in
this
little
syrian
town
flying
from
one
of
the
tallest
poles
the
people
stared
at
us
as
we
passed
and
i
noticed
among
them
many
bright
frankish
faces
with
eyes
too
clear
and
gray
for
syria
o
ye
kind
brothers
of
the
monastery
of
carmel
forgive
me
if
i
look
to
you
for
an
explanation
of
this
phenomenon
we
ascended
to
mount
carmel
the
path
led
through
a
grove
of
carob
trees
from
which
the
beans
known
in
germany
as
john
bread
are
produced
after
this
we
came
into
an
olive
grove
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
from
which
long
fields
of
wheat
giving
forth
a
ripe
summer
smell
flowed
down
to
the
shore
of
the
bay
the
olive
trees
were
of
immense
size
and
i
can
well
believe
as
fra
carlo
informed
us
that
they
were
probably
planted
by
the
roman
colonists
established
there
by
titus
the
gnarled
veteran
boles
still
send
forth
vigorous
and
blossoming
boughs
there
were
all
manner
of
lovely
lights
and
shades
chequered
over
the
turf
and
the
winding
path
we
rode
at
last
we
reached
the
foot
of
an
ascent
steeper
than
the
ladder
of
tyre
as
our
horses
slowly
climbed
to
the
convent
of
elijah
whence
we
already
saw
the
french
flag
floating
over
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
the
view
opened
grandly
to
the
north
and
east
revealing
the
bay
and
plain
of
acre
and
the
coast
as
far
as
ras
nakhura
from
which
we
first
saw
mount
carmel
the
day
previous
the
two
views
are
very
similar
in
character
one
being
the
obverse
of
the
other
we
reached
the
convent
dayr
mar
elias
as
the
arabs
call
it
at
noon
just
in
time
to
partake
of
a
bountiful
dinner
to
which
the
monks
had
treated
themselves
fra
carlo
the
good
franciscan
who
receives
strangers
showed
us
the
building
and
the
grotto
of
elijah
which
is
under
the
altar
of
the
convent
church
a
small
but
very
handsome
structure
of
italian
marble
the
sanctity
of
the
grotto
depends
on
tradition
entirely
as
there
is
no
mention
in
the
bible
of
elijah
having
resided
on
carmel
though
it
was
from
this
mountain
that
he
saw
the
cloud
like
a
man
hand
rising
from
the
sea
the
convent
which
is
quite
new
not
yet
completed
in
fact
is
a
large
massive
building
and
has
the
aspect
of
a
fortress
as
we
were
to
sleep
at
tantura
five
hours
distant
we
were
obliged
to
make
a
short
visit
in
spite
of
the
invitation
of
the
hospitable
fra
carlo
to
spend
the
night
there
in
the
afternoon
we
passed
the
ruins
of
athlit
a
town
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
castel
pellegrino
of
the
crusaders
our
road
now
followed
the
beach
nearly
the
whole
distance
to
jaffa
and
was
in
many
places
for
leagues
in
extent
a
solid
layer
of
white
brown
purple
and
rosy
shells
which
cracked
and
rattled
under
our
horses
feet
tantura
is
a
poor
arab
village
and
we
had
some
difficulty
in
procuring
provisions
the
people
lived
in
small
huts
of
mud
and
stones
near
the
sea
the
place
had
a
thievish
look
and
we
deemed
it
best
to
be
careful
in
the
disposal
of
our
baggage
for
the
night
in
the
morning
we
took
the
coast
again
riding
over
millions
of
shells
a
line
of
sandy
hills
covered
with
thickets
of
myrtle
and
mastic
shut
off
the
view
of
the
plain
and
meadows
between
the
sea
and
the
hills
of
samaria
after
three
hours
ride
we
saw
the
ruins
of
ancient
cæsarea
near
a
small
promontory
the
road
turned
away
from
the
sea
and
took
the
wild
plain
behind
which
is
completely
overgrown
with
camomile
chrysanthemum
and
wild
shrubs
the
ruins
of
the
town
are
visible
at
a
considerable
distance
along
the
coast
the
principal
remains
consist
of
a
massive
wall
flanked
with
pyramidal
bastions
at
regular
intervals
and
with
the
traces
of
gateways
and
towers
it
was
formerly
surrounded
by
a
deep
moat
within
this
space
which
may
be
a
quarter
of
a
mile
square
are
a
few
fragments
of
buildings
and
toward
the
sea
some
high
arches
and
masses
of
masonry
the
plain
around
abounds
with
traces
of
houses
streets
and
cæsarea
was
one
of
the
roman
colonies
but
owed
its
prosperity
principally
to
herod
paul
passed
through
it
on
his
way
from
macedon
to
jerusalem
by
the
very
road
we
were
travelling
during
the
day
the
path
struck
inland
over
a
vast
rolling
plain
covered
with
sage
lavender
and
other
shrubs
and
tenanted
by
herds
of
gazelles
and
flocks
of
large
storks
as
we
advanced
further
the
landscape
became
singularly
beautiful
it
was
a
broad
shallow
valley
swelling
away
towards
the
east
into
low
rolling
hills
far
back
of
which
rose
the
blue
line
of
the
mountains
the
of
judea
the
soil
where
it
was
ploughed
was
the
richest
vegetable
loam
where
it
lay
fallow
it
was
entirely
hidden
by
a
bed
of
grass
and
camomile
here
and
there
great
herds
of
sheep
and
goats
browsed
on
the
herbage
there
was
a
quiet
pastoral
air
about
the
landscape
a
soft
serenity
in
its
forms
and
colors
as
if
the
hebrew
patriarchs
still
made
it
their
abode
the
district
is
famous
for
robbers
and
we
kept
our
arms
in
readiness
never
suffering
the
baggage
to
be
out
of
our
sight
towards
evening
as
and
myself
with
françois
were
riding
in
advance
of
the
baggage
mules
the
former
with
his
gun
in
his
hand
i
with
a
pair
of
pistols
thrust
through
the
folds
of
my
shawl
and
françois
with
his
long
turkish
sabre
we
came
suddenly
upon
a
lonely
englishman
whose
companions
were
somewhere
in
the
rear
he
appeared
to
be
struck
with
terror
on
seeing
us
making
towards
him
and
turning
his
horse
head
made
an
attempt
to
fly
the
animal
however
was
restive
and
after
a
few
plunges
refused
to
move
the
traveller
gave
himself
up
for
lost
his
arms
dropped
by
his
side
he
stared
wildly
at
us
with
pale
face
and
eyes
opened
wide
with
a
look
of
helpless
fright
restraining
with
difficulty
a
shout
of
laughter
i
said
to
him
did
you
leave
jaffa
but
so
completely
was
his
ear
the
fool
of
his
imagination
that
he
thought
i
was
speaking
arabic
and
made
a
faint
attempt
to
get
out
the
only
word
or
two
of
that
language
which
he
knew
i
then
repeated
with
as
much
distinctness
as
i
could
command
did
you
leave
jaffa
he
stammered
mechanically
through
his
chattering
teeth
and
we
immediately
dashed
off
at
a
gallop
through
the
bushes
when
we
last
saw
him
he
was
standing
as
we
left
him
apparently
not
yet
recovered
from
the
shock
at
the
little
village
of
el
haram
where
we
spent
the
night
i
visited
the
tomb
of
sultan
ali
who
is
now
revered
as
a
saint
it
is
enclosed
in
a
mosque
crowning
the
top
of
a
hill
i
was
admitted
into
the
without
hesitation
though
from
the
porter
styling
me
effendi
he
probably
took
me
for
a
turk
at
the
entrance
to
the
inner
court
i
took
off
my
slippers
and
walked
to
the
tomb
of
the
sultan
a
square
heap
of
white
marble
in
a
small
marble
enclosure
in
one
of
the
niches
in
the
wall
near
the
tomb
there
is
a
very
old
iron
box
with
a
slit
in
the
top
the
porter
informed
me
that
it
contained
a
charm
belonging
to
sultan
ali
which
was
of
great
use
in
producing
rain
in
times
of
drouth
in
the
morning
we
sent
our
baggage
by
a
short
road
across
the
country
to
this
place
and
then
rode
down
the
beach
towards
jaffa
the
sun
came
out
bright
and
hot
as
we
paced
along
the
line
of
spray
our
horses
feet
sinking
above
the
fetlocks
in
pink
and
purple
shells
while
the
droll
scampered
away
from
our
path
and
the
blue
gelatinous
were
tossed
before
us
by
the
surge
our
view
was
confined
to
the
sometimes
covered
with
a
flood
of
scarlet
poppies
on
one
hand
and
to
the
blue
sea
on
the
other
the
terrible
coast
was
still
lined
with
wrecks
and
just
before
reaching
the
town
we
passed
a
vessel
of
some
two
hundred
tons
recently
cast
ashore
with
her
strong
hull
still
unbroken
we
forded
the
rapid
stream
of
el
anjeh
which
comes
down
from
the
plain
of
sharon
the
water
rising
to
our
saddles
the
low
promontory
in
front
now
broke
into
towers
and
white
domes
and
great
masses
of
heavy
walls
the
aspect
of
jaffa
is
exceedingly
picturesque
it
is
built
on
a
hill
and
the
land
for
many
miles
around
it
being
low
and
flat
its
topmost
houses
overlook
all
the
fields
of
sharon
the
old
harbor
protected
by
a
reef
of
rocks
is
on
the
north
side
of
the
town
but
is
now
so
sanded
up
that
large
vessels
can
not
enter
a
number
of
small
craft
were
lying
close
to
the
shore
the
port
presented
a
different
scene
when
the
ships
of
hiram
king
of
tyre
came
in
with
the
materials
for
the
temple
of
solomon
there
is
but
one
gate
on
the
land
side
which
is
rather
strongly
fortified
outside
of
this
there
is
an
open
space
which
we
found
filled
with
venders
of
oranges
and
vegetables
and
the
like
some
vociferating
in
loud
dispute
some
given
up
to
silence
and
smoke
under
the
shade
of
the
sycamores
we
rode
under
the
heavily
arched
and
towered
gateway
and
entered
the
bazaar
the
street
was
crowded
and
there
was
such
a
confusion
of
camels
donkeys
and
men
that
we
made
our
way
with
difficulty
along
the
only
practicable
street
in
the
city
to
the
where
françois
pointed
out
a
hole
in
the
wall
as
the
veritable
spot
where
jonah
was
cast
ashore
by
the
whale
this
part
of
the
harbor
is
the
receptacle
of
all
the
offal
of
the
town
and
i
do
not
wonder
that
the
whale
stomach
should
have
turned
on
approaching
it
the
was
filled
with
merchants
and
traders
and
we
were
obliged
to
pick
our
way
between
bars
of
iron
skins
of
oil
heaps
of
oranges
and
piles
of
building
timber
at
last
we
reached
the
end
and
as
there
was
no
other
thoroughfare
returned
the
same
way
we
went
passed
out
the
gate
and
took
the
road
to
ramleh
and
jerusalem
but
i
hear
the
voice
of
françois
announcing
le
diner
est
we
are
encamped
just
beside
the
pool
of
ramleh
and
the
mongrel
children
of
the
town
are
making
a
great
noise
in
the
meadow
below
it
our
horses
are
enjoying
their
barley
and
mustapha
stands
at
the
tying
up
his
sacks
dogs
are
barking
and
donkeys
braying
all
along
the
borders
of
the
town
whose
filth
and
dilapidation
are
happily
concealed
by
the
fig
and
olive
gardens
which
surround
it
i
have
not
curiosity
enough
to
visit
the
greek
and
latin
convents
embedded
in
its
foul
purlieus
but
content
myself
with
gazing
from
my
door
upon
the
blue
hills

we
must
cross

the

regained

leaving

we
rode
eastward
between
delightful
gardens
of
fig
citron
orange
pomegranate
and
palm
the
country
for
several
miles
around
the
city
is
a
complete
level
part
of
the
great
plain
of
sharon
and
the
gray
mass
of
building
crowning
the
little
promontory
is
the
only
landmark
seen
above
the
green
on
looking
towards
the
sea
the
road
was
lined
with
hedges
of
giant
cactus
now
in
blossom
and
shaded
occasionally
with
sycamores
the
orange
trees
were
in
bloom
and
at
the
same
time
laden
down
with
ripe
fruit
the
oranges
of
jaffa
are
the
finest
in
syria
and
great
numbers
of
them
are
sent
to
beyrout
and
other
ports
further
north
the
dark
foliage
of
the
pomegranate
fairly
blazed
with
its
heavy
scarlet
blossoms
and
here
and
there
a
cluster
of
roses
made
good
the
scriptural
renown
of
those
of
sharon
the
road
was
filled
with
people
passing
to
and
fro
and
several
families
of
jaffa
jews
were
having
a
sort
of
in
the
choice
shady
spots
ere
long
we
came
to
a
fountain
at
a
point
where
two
roads
met
it
was
a
large
square
structure
of
limestone
and
marble
with
a
stone
trough
in
front
and
a
delightful
open
chamber
at
the
side
the
space
in
front
was
shaded
with
immense
sycamore
trees
to
which
we
tied
our
horses
and
then
took
our
seats
in
the
window
above
the
fountain
where
the
greek
brought
us
our
breakfast
the
water
was
cool
and
delicious
as
were
our
jaffa
oranges
it
was
a
charming
spot
for
as
we
sat
we
could
look
under
the
boughs
of
the
great
trees
and
down
between
the
gardens
to
jaffa
and
the
mediterranean
after
leaving
the
gardens
we
came
upon
the
great
plain
of
sharon
on
which
we
could
see
the
husbandmen
at
work
far
and
near
ploughing
and
sowing
their
grain
in
some
instances
the
two
operations
were
made
simultaneously
by
having
a
sort
of
funnel
attached
to
the
running
into
a
tube
which
entered
the
earth
just
behind
the
share
the
man
held
the
plough
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
dropped
the
requisite
quantity
of
seed
through
the
tube
into
the
furrow
the
people
are
ploughing
now
for
their
summer
crops
and
the
wheat
and
barley
which
they
sowed
last
winter
are
already
in
full
head
on
other
parts
of
the
plain
there
were
large
flocks
of
sheep
and
goats
with
their
attendant
shepherds
so
ran
the
rich
landscape
broken
only
by
belts
of
olive
trees
to
the
far
hills
of
judea
riding
on
over
the
long
low
swells
fragrant
with
wild
thyme
and
camomile
we
saw
at
last
the
tower
of
ramleh
and
down
the
valley
an
hour
ride
to
the
the
minaret
of
ludd
the
ancient
lydda
still
further
i
could
see
the
houses
of
the
village
of
sharon
embowered
in
olives
ramleh
is
built
along
the
crest
and
on
the
eastern
slope
of
a
low
hill
and
at
a
distance
appears
like
a
stately
place
but
this
impression
is
immediately
dissipated
on
entering
it
west
of
the
town
is
a
large
square
tower
between
eighty
and
ninety
feet
in
height
we
rode
up
to
it
through
an
orchard
of
ancient
olive
trees
and
over
a
field
of
beans
the
tower
is
evidently
a
minaret
as
it
is
built
in
the
purest
saracenic
style
and
is
surrounded
by
the
ruins
of
a
mosque
i
have
rarely
seen
anything
more
graceful
than
the
ornamental
arches
of
the
upper
portions
over
the
door
is
a
lintel
of
white
marble
with
an
arabic
inscription
the
mosque
to
which
the
tower
is
attached
is
almost
entirely
destroyed
and
only
part
of
the
arches
of
a
corridor
around
three
sides
of
a
with
the
fountain
in
the
centre
still
remain
the
subterranean
cisterns
under
the
amazed
me
with
their
extent
and
magnitude
they
are
no
less
than
feet
deep
and
covered
by
vaulted
ceilings
each
twelve
feet
square
and
resting
on
massive
pillars
the
mosque
when
entire
must
have
been
one
of
the
finest
in
syria
we
clambered
over
the
broken
stones
cumbering
the
entrance
and
mounted
the
steps
to
the
very
summit
the
view
reached
from
jaffa
and
the
sea
to
the
mountains
near
jerusalem
and
southward
to
the
plain
of
ascalon
a
great
expanse
of
grain
and
grazing
land
all
blossoming
as
the
rose
and
dotted
especially
near
the
mountains
with
dark
luxuriant
the
landscape
had
something
of
the
green
pastoral
beauty
of
england
except
the
mountains
which
were
wholly
of
palestine
the
shadows
of
fleecy
clouds
drifting
slowly
from
east
to
west
moved
across
the
landscape
which
became
every
moment
softer
and
fairer
in
the
light
of
the
declining
sun
i
did
not
tarry
in
ramleh
the
streets
are
narrow
crooked
and
filthy
as
only
an
oriental
town
can
be
the
houses
have
either
flat
roofs
or
domes
out
of
the
crevices
in
which
springs
a
plentiful
crop
of
weeds
some
yellow
dogs
barked
at
us
as
we
passed
children
in
tattered
garments
stared
and
old
turbaned
heads
were
raised
from
the
pipe
to
guess
who
the
two
brown
individuals
might
be
and
why
they
were
attended
by
such
a
fierce
passing
through
the
eastern
gate
we
were
gladdened
by
the
sight
of
our
tents
already
pitched
in
the
meadow
beside
the
cistern
dervish
had
arrived
an
hour
before
us
and
had
everything
ready
for
the
sweet
lounge
of
an
hour
to
which
we
treat
ourselves
after
a
day
ride
i
watched
the
evening
fade
away
over
the
blue
hills
before
us
and
tried
to
convince
myself
that
i
should
reach
jerusalem
on
the
morrow
reason
said
you
certainly
will
to
faith
the
holy
city
was
as
far
off
as
ever
was
it
possible
that
i
was
in
judea
was
this
the
holy
land
of
the
crusades
the
soil
hallowed
by
the
feet
of
christ
and
his
apostles
i
must
believe
it
yet
it
seemed
once
that
if
i
ever
trod
that
earth
then
beneath
my
feet
there
would
be
thenceforth
a
consecration
in
my
life
a
holy
essence
a
purer
inspiration
on
the
lips
a
surer
faith
in
the
heart
and
because
i
was
not
other
than
i
had
been
i
half
doubted
whether
it
was
the
palestine
of
my
dreams
a
number
of
arab
cameleers
who
had
come
with
travellers
across
the
desert
from
egypt
were
encamped
near
us
françois
was
suspicious
of
some
of
them
and
therefore
divided
the
night
into
three
watches
which
were
kept
by
himself
and
our
two
men
mustapha
was
the
last
and
kept
not
only
himself
but
myself
wide
awake
by
his
dolorous
chants
of
love
and
religion
i
fell
sound
asleep
at
dawn
but
was
roused
before
sunrise
by
françois
who
wished
to
start
betimes
on
account
of
the
rugged
road
we
had
to
travel
the
morning
was
mild
clear
and
balmy
and
we
were
soon
packed
and
in
motion
leaving
the
baggage
to
follow
we
rode
ahead
over
the
fertile
fields
the
wheat
and
poppies
were
glistening
with
dew
birds
sang
among
the
a
cool
breeze
came
down
from
the
hollows
of
the
hills
and
my
blood
leaped
as
nimbly
and
joyously
as
a
young
hart
on
the
mountains
of
bether
between
ramleh
and
the
a
distance
of
about
eight
miles
is
the
rolling
plain
of
arimathea
and
this
as
well
as
the
greater
part
of
the
plain
of
sharon
is
one
of
the
richest
districts
in
the
world
the
soil
is
a
loam
and
without
manure
produces
annually
superb
crops
of
wheat
and
barley
we
rode
for
miles
through
a
sea
of
wheat
waving
far
and
wide
over
the
swells
of
land
the
tobacco
in
the
fields
about
ramleh
was
the
most
luxuriant
i
ever
saw
and
the
olive
and
fig
attain
a
size
and
lusty
strength
wholly
unknown
in
italy
judea
cursed
of
god
what
a
misconception
not
only
of
god
mercy
and
beneficence
but
of
the
actual
fact
give
palestine
into
christian
hands
and
it
will
again
flow
with
milk
and
honey
except
some
parts
of
asia
minor
no
portion
of
the
levant
is
capable
of
yielding
such
a
harvest
of
grain
silk
wool
fruits
oil
and
wine
the
great
disadvantage
under
which
the
country
labors
is
its
frequent
drouths
but
were
the
soil
more
generally
cultivated
and
the
old
orchards
replanted
these
would
neither
be
so
frequent
nor
so
severe
we
gradually
ascended
the
hills
passing
one
or
two
villages
imbedded
in
groves
of
olives
in
the
little
valleys
slanting
down
to
the
plains
the
arabs
were
still
ploughing
and
sowing
singing
the
while
an
old
with
its
chorus
of
ghazalee
ya
ghazalee
oh
gazelle
oh
gazelle
the
valley
narrowed
the
lowlands
behind
us
spread
out
broader
and
in
half
an
hour
more
we
were
threading
a
narrow
pass
between
stony
hills
overgrown
with
ilex
myrtle
and
dwarf
oak
the
wild
purple
rose
of
palestine
blossomed
on
all
sides
and
a
fragrant
white
honeysuckle
in
some
places
hung
from
the
rocks
the
path
was
terribly
rough
and
barely
wide
enough
for
two
persons
on
horseback
to
pass
each
other
we
met
a
few
pilgrims
returning
from
jerusalem
and
a
straggling
company
of
armed
turks
who
had
such
a
piratical
air
that
without
the
solemn
asseveration
of
françois
that
the
road
was
quite
safe
i
should
have
felt
uneasy
about
our
baggage
most
of
the
persons
we
passed
were
mussulmen
few
of
whom
gave
the
customary
peace
be
with
you
but
once
a
syrian
christian
saluted
me
with
god
go
with
you
o
pilgrim
for
two
hours
after
entering
the
mountains
there
was
scarcely
a
sign
of
cultivation
the
rock
was
limestone
or
marble
lying
in
horizontal
strata
the
broken
edges
of
which
rose
like
terraces
to
the
summits
these
shelves
were
so
covered
with
wild
shrubs
in
some
places
even
with
rows
of
olive
trees
to
me
they
had
not
the
least
appearance
of
that
desolation
so
generally
ascribed
to
them
in
a
little
dell
among
the
hills
there
is
a
small
ruined
mosque
or
chapel
i
could
not
decide
which
shaded
by
a
group
of
magnificent
terebinth
trees
several
arabs
were
resting
in
its
shade
and
we
hoped
to
find
there
the
water
we
were
looking
for
in
order
to
make
breakfast
but
it
was
not
to
be
found
and
we
climbed
nearly
to
the
summit
of
the
first
chain
of
hills
where
in
a
small
olive
orchard
there
was
a
cistern
filled
by
the
late
rains
it
belonged
to
two
ragged
boys
who
brought
us
an
earthen
vessel
of
the
water
and
then
asked
shall
we
bring
you
milk
o
pilgrims
i
assented
and
received
a
small
jug
of
thick
buttermilk
not
remarkably
clean
but
very
refreshing
my
companion
who
had
not
recovered
from
his
horror
at
finding
that
the
inhabitants
of
ramleh
washed
themselves
in
the
pool
which
supplied
us
and
them
refused
to
touch
it
we
made
but
a
short
rest
for
it
was
now
nearly
noon
and
there
were
yet
many
rough
miles
between
us
and
jerusalem
we
crossed
the
first
chain
of
mountains
rode
a
short
distance
over
a
stony
upland
and
then
descended
into
a
long
cultivated
valley
running
to
the
eastward
at
the
end
nearest
us
appeared
the
village
of
aboo
ghosh
the
father
of
lies
which
takes
its
name
from
a
noted
bedouin
shekh
who
distinguished
himself
a
few
years
ago
by
levying
contributions
on
travellers
he
obtained
a
large
sum
of
money
in
this
way
but
as
he
added
murder
to
robbery
and
fell
upon
turks
as
well
as
christians
he
was
finally
captured
and
is
now
expiating
his
offences
in
some
mine
on
the
coast
of
the
black
sea
near
the
bottom
of
the
village
there
is
a
large
ruined
building
now
used
as
a
stable
by
the
inhabitants
the
interior
is
divided
into
a
nave
and
two
by
rows
of
square
pillars
from
which
spring
pointed
arches
the
is
at
the
side
and
is
gothic
with
a
dash
of
saracenic
in
the
ornamental
mouldings
above
it
the
large
window
at
the
extremity
of
the
nave
is
remarkable
for
having
round
arches
which
circumstance
together
with
the
traces
of
arabesque
painted
ornaments
on
the
columns
led
me
to
think
it
might
have
been
a
mosque
but
robinson
who
is
now
here
considers
it
a
christian
church
of
the
time
of
the
crusaders
the
village
of
aboo
ghosh
is
said
to
be
the
site
of
the
of
the
prophet
jeremiah
and
i
can
well
imagine
it
to
have
been
the
case
the
aspect
of
the
to
the
east
and
would
explain
the
savage
dreariness
of
his
lamentations
the
whole
valley
in
which
the
village
stands
as
well
as
another
which
joins
it
on
the
east
is
most
assiduously
cultivated
the
stony
mountain
sides
are
wrought
into
terraces
where
in
spite
of
soil
which
resembles
an
american
turnpike
patches
of
wheat
are
growing
luxuriantly
and
olive
trees
centuries
old
hold
on
to
the
rocks
with
a
clutch
as
hard
and
bony
as
the
hand
of
death
in
the
bed
of
the
valley
the
fig
tree
thrives
and
sometimes
the
vine
and
fig
grow
together
forming
the
patriarchal
arbor
of
shade
familiar
to
us
all
the
shoots
of
the
tree
are
still
young
and
green
but
the
blossoms
of
the
grape
do
not
yet
give
forth
their
goodly
savor
i
did
not
hear
the
voice
of
the
turtle
but
a
nightingale
sang
in
the
briery
thickets
by
the
brook
side
as
we
passed
along
climbing
out
of
this
valley
we
descended
by
a
stony
staircase
as
rugged
as
the
ladder
of
tyre
into
the
wady
here
were
gardens
of
oranges
in
blossom
with
orchards
of
quince
and
apple
overgrown
with
vines
and
the
fragrant
hawthorn
tree
snowy
with
its
bloom
a
stone
bridge
the
only
one
on
the
road
crosses
the
dry
bed
of
a
winter
stream
and
looking
up
the
glen
i
saw
the
arab
village
of
kulonieh
at
the
entrance
of
the
valley
of
elah
glorious
with
the
memories
of
the
david
our
road
turned
off
to
the
right
and
commenced
ascending
a
long
dry
glen
between
mountains
which
grew
more
sterile
the
further
we
went
it
was
nearly
two
hours
past
noon
the
sun
fiercely
hot
and
our
horses
were
nigh
jaded
out
with
the
rough
road
and
our
impatient
spurring
i
began
to
fancy
we
could
see
jerusalem
from
the
top
of
the
pass
and
tried
to
think
of
the
ancient
days
of
judea
but
it
was
in
vain
a
newer
picture
shut
them
out
and
banished
even
the
diviner
images
of
our
saviour
and
his
disciples
heathen
that
i
was
i
could
only
think
of
godfrey
and
the
crusaders
toiling
up
the
same
path
and
the
ringing
lines
of
tasso
vibrated
constantly
in
my
ear
ecco
apparir
gierusalemm
si
vede
ecco
additar
gierusalemm
si
scorge
ecco
da
mille
voci
unitamente
gierusalemme
salutar
si
sente
the
palestine
of
the
bible
the
land
of
promise
to
the
israelites
the
land
of
miracle
and
sacrifice
to
the
apostles
and
their
followers
still
slept
in
the
unattainable
distance
under
a
sky
of
bluer
and
more
tranquil
loveliness
than
that
to
whose
cloudless
vault
i
looked
up
it
lay
as
far
and
beautiful
as
it
once
seemed
to
the
eye
of
childhood
and
the
swords
of
seraphim
kept
profane
feet
from
its
sacred
hills
but
these
rough
rocks
around
me
these
dry
fiery
hollows
these
thickets
of
ancient
oak
and
ilex
had
heard
the
trumpets
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
clang
and
clatter
of
european
armor
i
could
feel
and
believe
that
i
entered
the
ranks
i
followed
the
trumpets
and
the
holy
hymns
and
waited
breathlessly
for
the
moment
when
every
mailed
knee
should
drop
in
the
dust
and
every
bearded
and
sunburned
cheek
be
wet
with
devotional
tears
but
when
i
climbed
the
last
ridge
and
looked
ahead
with
a
sort
of
painful
suspense
jerusalem
did
not
appear
we
were
two
thousand
feet
above
the
mediterranean
whose
blue
we
could
dimly
see
far
to
the
west
through
notches
in
the
chain
of
hills
to
the
north
the
mountains
were
gray
desolate
and
awful
not
a
shrub
or
a
tree
relieved
their
frightful
barrenness
an
upland
tract
covered
with
white
volcanic
rock
lay
before
us
we
met
peasants
with
asses
who
looked
to
my
eyes
as
if
they
had
just
left
jerusalem
still
forward
we
urged
our
horses
and
reached
a
ruined
garden
surrounded
with
hedges
of
cactus
over
which
i
saw
domes
and
walls
in
the
distance
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
looked
at
françois
he
was
jogging
along
without
turning
his
head
he
could
not
have
been
so
indifferent
if
that
was
really
the
city
presently
we
reached
another
slight
rise
in
the
rocky
plain
he
began
to
urge
his
panting
horse
and
at
the
same
instant
we
both
lashed
the
spirit
into
ours
dashed
on
at
a
gallop
round
the
corner
of
an
old
wall
on
the
top
of
the
hill
and
lo
the
holy
city
our
greek
jerked
both
pistols
from
his
holsters
and
fired
them
into
the
air
as
we
reined
up
on
the
steep
from
the
descriptions
of
travellers
i
had
expected
to
see
in
jerusalem
an
ordinary
modern
turkish
town
but
that
before
me
with
its
walls
fortresses
and
domes
was
it
not
still
the
city
of
david
i
saw
the
jerusalem
of
the
new
testament
as
i
had
imagined
it
long
lines
of
walls
crowned
with
a
notched
parapet
and
strengthened
by
towers
a
few
domes
and
spires
above
them
clusters
of
cypress
here
and
there
this
was
all
that
was
visible
of
the
city
on
either
side
the
hill
sloped
down
to
the
two
deep
valleys
over
which
it
hangs
on
the
east
the
mount
of
olives
crowned
with
a
chapel
and
mosque
rose
high
and
steep
but
in
front
the
eye
passed
directly
over
the
city
to
rest
far
away
upon
the
lofty
mountains
of
moab
beyond
the
dead
sea
the
scene
was
grand
in
its
simplicity
the
prominent
colors
were
the
purple
of
those
distant
mountains
and
the
hoary
gray
of
the
nearer
hills
the
walls
were
of
the
dull
yellow
of
marble
and
the
only
trees
the
dark
cypress
and
moonlit
olive
now
indeed
for
one
brief
moment
i
knew
that
i
was
in
palestine
that
i
saw
mount
olivet
and
mount
zion
and
i
know
not
how
it
was
my
sight
grew
weak
and
all
objects
trembled
and
wavered
in
a
watery
film
since
we
arrived
i
have
looked
down
upon
the
city
from
the
mount
of
olives
and
up
to
it
from
the
valley
of
jehosaphat
but
i
can
not
restore
the
illusion
of
that
first
view
we
allowed
our
horses
to
walk
slowly
down
the
remaining
to
the
jaffa
gate
an
englishman
with
a
red
silk
shawl
over
his
head
was
sketching
the
city
while
an
arab
held
an
umbrella
over
him
inside
the
gate
we
stumbled
upon
an
italian
shop
with
an
italian
sign
and
after
threading
a
number
of
intricate
passages
under
dark
archways
and
being
turned
off
from
one
hotel
which
was
full
of
travellers
reached
another
kept
by
a
converted
german
jew
where
we
found
robinson
and
ely
smith
who
both
arrived
yesterday
it
sounds
strange
to
talk
of
a
hotel
in
jerusalem
but
the
world
is
progressing
and
there
are
already
three
i
leave
for
jericho
the
jordan
and
the
dead
sea
and
shall
have
more
to
say
of
jerusalem
on
my
return
chapter
iv
the
dead
sea
and
the

river
bargaining
for
a
guard
departure
from

the

the

the

also
shall
perish
and
the

as
the
lord

spoken
jeremiah
xlviii
jerusalem
i
returned
this
after
noon
from
an
excursion
to
the
dead
sea
the
river
jordan
and
the
site
of
jericho
owing
to
the
approaching
heats
an
early
visit
was
deemed
desirable
and
the
shekhs
who
have
charge
of
the
road
were
summoned
to
meet
us
on
the
day
after
we
arrived
there
are
two
of
these
gentlemen
the
shekh
of
the
bedouins
and
the
shekh
of
the
peasants
or
husbandmen
to
whom
each
traveller
is
obliged
to
pay
one
hundred
piastres
for
an
escort
it
is
in
fact
a
sort
of
compromise
by
which
the
shekhs
agree
not
to
rob
the
traveller
and
to
protect
him
against
other
shekhs
if
the
road
is
not
actually
safe
the
turkish
garrison
here
is
a
mere
farce
but
the
arrangement
is
winked
at
by
the
pasha
who
of
course
gets
his
share
of
the
piastres
which
the
two
scamps
yearly
levy
upon
travellers
the
shekhs
came
to
our
rooms
and
after
trying
to
postpone
our
departure
in
order
to
attach
other
tourists
to
the
same
escort
and
thus
save
a
little
expense
took
half
the
pay
and
agreed
to
be
ready
the
next
morning
unfortunately
for
my
original
plan
the
convent
of
san
saba
has
been
closed
within
two
or
three
weeks
and
no
stranger
is
now
admitted
this
unusual
step
was
caused
by
the
disorderly
conduct
of
some
frenchmen
who
visited
san
saba
we
sent
to
the
bishop
of
the
greek
church
asking
a
simple
permission
to
view
the
interior
of
the
convent
but
without
effect
we
left
the
city
yesterday
morning
by
stephen
gate
descended
to
the
valley
of
jehosaphat
rode
under
the
stone
wall
which
encloses
the
supposed
gethsemane
and
took
a
path
leading
along
the
mount
of
olives
towards
the
hill
of
offence
which
stands
over
against
the
southern
end
of
the
city
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
vale
of
hinnon
neither
of
the
shekhs
made
his
appearance
but
sent
in
their
stead
three
arabs
two
of
whom
were
mounted
and
armed
with
sabres
and
long
guns
our
man
mustapha
had
charge
of
the
carrying
our
tent
and
the
provisions
for
the
trip
it
was
a
dull
sultry
morning
a
dark
leaden
haze
hung
over
jerusalem
and
the
or
came
from
the
out
of
the
arabian
desert
we
had
again
resumed
the
oriental
costume
but
in
spite
of
an
ample
turban
my
face
soon
began
to
scorch
in
the
dry
heat
from
the
crest
of
the
hill
of
offence
there
is
a
wide
view
over
the
heights
on
both
sides
of
the
valley
of
the
brook
kedron
their
sides
are
worked
into
terraces
now
green
with
springing
grain
and
near
the
bottom
planted
with
olive
and
fig
trees
the
upland
ridge
or
watershed
of
palestine
is
cultivated
for
a
considerable
distance
around
jerusalem
the
soil
is
light
and
stony
yet
appears
to
yield
a
good
return
for
the
little
labor
bestowed
upon
it
crossing
the
southern
flank
of
mount
olivet
in
half
an
hour
we
reached
the
village
of
bethany
hanging
on
the
side
of
the
hill
it
is
a
miserable
cluster
of
arab
huts
with
not
a
building
which
appears
to
be
more
than
a
century
old
the
grotto
of
lazarus
is
here
shown
and
of
course
we
stopped
to
see
it
it
belongs
to
an
old
mussulman
who
came
out
of
his
house
with
a
piece
of
waxed
rope
to
light
us
down
an
aperture
opens
from
the
roadside
into
the
hill
and
there
is
barely
room
enough
for
a
person
to
enter
descending
about
twenty
steps
at
a
sharp
angle
we
landed
in
a
small
damp
vault
with
an
opening
in
the
floor
communicating
with
a
short
passage
below
the
vault
was
undoubtedly
excavated
for
sepulchral
purposes
and
the
bodies
were
probably
deposited
as
in
many
egyptian
tombs
in
the
pit
under
it
our
guide
however
pointed
to
a
square
mass
of
masonry
in
one
corner
as
the
tomb
of
lazarus
whose
body
he
informed
us
was
still
walled
up
there
there
was
an
arch
in
the
side
of
the
vault
once
leading
to
other
chambers
but
now
closed
up
and
the
guide
stated
that
prophets
were
interred
therein
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
the
present
arab
village
occupies
the
site
of
bethany
and
if
it
could
be
proved
that
this
pit
existed
at
the
beginning
of
the
christian
era
and
there
never
had
been
any
other
we
might
accept
it
as
the
tomb
of
lazarus
on
the
crest
of
a
high
hill
over
against
bethany
is
an
arab
village
on
the
site
of
bethpage
we
descended
into
the
valley
of
a
winter
stream
now
filled
with
patches
of
sparse
wheat
just
beginning
to
ripen
the
mountains
grew
more
bleak
and
desolate
as
we
advanced
and
as
there
is
a
regular
descent
in
the
several
ranges
over
which
one
must
pass
the
distant
hills
of
the
lands
of
moab
and
ammon
were
always
in
sight
rising
like
a
high
blue
wall
against
the
sky
the
dead
sea
is
feet
below
jerusalem
but
the
general
slope
of
the
intervening
district
is
so
regular
that
from
the
spires
of
the
city
and
the
mount
of
olives
one
can
look
down
directly
upon
its
waters
this
deceived
me
as
to
the
actual
distance
and
i
could
scarcely
credit
the
assertion
of
our
arab
escort
that
it
would
require
six
hours
to
reach
it
after
we
had
ridden
nearly
two
hours
we
left
the
jericho
road
sending
mustapha
and
a
staunch
old
arab
direct
to
our
for
the
night
in
the
valley
of
the
jordan
the
two
mounted
bedouins
accompanied
us
across
the
rugged
mountains
lying
between
us
and
the
dead
sea
at
first
we
took
the
way
to
the
convent
of
mar
saba
following
the
course
of
the
brook
kedron
down
the
wady
valley
of
fire
in
half
an
hour
more
we
reached
two
large
tanks
hewn
out
under
the
base
of
a
limestone
cliff
and
nearly
filled
with
rain
the
surface
was
covered
with
a
greenish
vegetable
scum
and
three
wild
and
dirty
arabs
of
the
hills
were
washing
themselves
in
the
principal
one
our
bedouins
immediately
dismounted
and
followed
their
example
and
after
we
had
taken
some
refreshment
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
filling
our
from
the
same
sweet
pool
after
this
we
left
the
san
saba
road
and
mounted
the
height
east
of
the
valley
from
that
point
all
signs
of
cultivation
and
habitation
disappeared
the
mountains
were
grim
bare
and
frightfully
rugged
the
scanty
grass
coaxed
into
life
by
the
winter
rains
was
already
scorched
out
of
all
greenness
some
bunches
of
wild
sage
gnaphalium
and
other
hardy
aromatic
herbs
spotted
the
yellow
soil
and
in
sheltered
places
the
scarlet
poppies
burned
like
coals
of
fire
among
the
rifts
of
the
gray
limestone
rock
our
track
kept
along
the
higher
ridges
and
crests
of
the
hills
between
the
glens
and
gorges
which
sank
on
either
hand
to
a
dizzy
depth
below
and
were
so
steep
as
to
be
almost
inaccessible
the
region
is
so
scarred
gashed
and
torn
that
no
work
of
man
hand
can
save
it
from
perpetual
desolation
it
is
a
wilderness
more
hopeless
than
the
desert
if
i
were
left
alone
in
the
midst
of
it
i
should
lie
down
and
await
death
without
thought
or
hope
of
rescue
the
character
of
the
day
was
peculiarly
suited
to
enhance
the
impression
of
such
scenery
though
there
were
no
clouds
the
sun
was
invisible
as
far
as
we
could
see
beyond
the
jordan
and
away
southward
to
the
mountains
of
moab
and
the
cliffs
of
engaddi
the
whole
country
was
covered
as
with
the
smoke
of
a
furnace
and
the
furious
sirocco
that
threatened
to
topple
us
down
the
gulfs
yawning
on
either
hand
had
no
coolness
on
its
wings
the
horses
were
but
now
and
then
a
gust
would
come
that
made
them
and
us
strain
against
it
to
avoid
being
dashed
against
the
rock
on
one
side
or
hurled
off
the
brink
on
the
other
the
atmosphere
was
painfully
oppressive
and
by
and
by
a
dogged
silence
took
possession
of
our
party
after
passing
a
lofty
peak
which
françois
called
djebel
nuttar
the
mountain
of
rain
we
came
to
a
large
moslem
building
situated
on
a
bleak
eminence
overlooking
part
of
the
valley
of
the
jordan
this
is
the
tomb
called
nebbee
moussa
by
the
arabs
and
believed
by
them
to
stand
upon
the
spot
where
moses
died
we
halted
at
the
gate
but
no
one
came
to
admit
us
though
my
companion
thought
he
saw
a
man
head
at
one
of
the
apertures
in
the
wall
arab
tradition
here
is
as
much
at
fault
as
christian
tradition
in
many
other
places
the
true
nebo
is
somewhere
in
the
chain
of
pisgah
and
though
probably
i
saw
it
and
all
see
it
who
go
down
to
the
jordan
yet
no
man
knoweth
its
place
unto
this
day
beyond
nebbee
moussa
we
came
out
upon
the
last
heights
overlooking
the
dead
sea
though
several
miles
of
low
hills
remained
to
be
passed
the
head
of
the
sea
was
visible
as
far
as
the
on
the
west
and
the
hot
fountains
of
callirhoë
on
the
eastern
shore
farther
than
this
all
was
vapor
and
darkness
the
water
was
a
soft
deep
purple
hue
brightening
into
blue
our
road
led
down
what
seemed
a
vast
sloping
causeway
from
the
mountains
between
two
ravines
walled
by
cliffs
several
hundred
feet
in
height
it
gradually
flattened
into
a
plain
covered
with
a
white
saline
incrustation
and
grown
with
clumps
of
sour
willow
tamarisk
and
other
shrubs
among
which
i
looked
in
vain
for
the
osher
or
dead
sea
apple
the
plants
appeared
as
if
smitten
with
leprosy
but
there
were
some
flowers
growing
almost
to
the
margin
of
the
sea
we
reached
the
shore
about
the
heat
by
this
time
was
most
severe
and
the
air
so
dense
as
to
occasion
pains
in
my
ears
the
dead
sea
is
feet
below
the
mediterranean
and
without
doubt
the
lowest
part
of
the
surface
i
attribute
the
oppression
i
felt
to
this
fact
and
to
the
sultriness
of
the
day
rather
than
to
any
exhalation
from
the
sea
itself
françois
remarked
however
that
had
the
wind
which
by
this
time
was
veering
round
to
the
blown
from
the
south
we
could
scarcely
have
endured
it
the
sea
resembles
a
great
cauldron
sunk
between
mountains
from
three
to
four
thousand
feet
in
height
and
probably
we
did
not
experience
more
than
a
tithe
of
the
summer
heat
i
proposed
a
bath
for
the
sake
of
experiment
but
françois
endeavored
to
dissuade
us
he
had
tried
it
and
nothing
could
be
more
disagreeable
we
risked
getting
a
fever
and
besides
there
were
four
hours
of
dangerous
travel
yet
before
us
but
by
this
time
we
were
half
undressed
and
soon
were
floating
on
the
clear
bituminous
waves
the
beach
was
fine
gravel
and
shelved
gradually
down
i
kept
my
turban
on
my
head
and
was
careful
to
avoid
touching
the
water
with
my
face
the
sea
was
moderately
warm
and
gratefully
soft
and
soothing
to
the
skin
it
was
impossible
to
sink
and
even
while
swimming
the
body
rose
half
out
of
the
water
i
should
think
it
possible
to
dive
for
a
short
distance
but
prefer
that
some
one
else
would
try
the
experiment
with
a
log
of
wood
for
a
pillow
one
might
sleep
as
on
one
of
the
patent
mattresses
the
taste
of
the
water
is
salty
and
pungent
and
stings
the
tongue
like
saltpetre
we
were
obliged
to
dress
in
all
haste
without
even
wiping
off
the
detestable
liquid
yet
i
experienced
very
little
of
that
discomfort
which
most
travellers
have
remarked
where
the
skin
had
been
previously
bruised
there
was
a
slight
smarting
sensation
and
my
body
felt
clammy
and
glutinous
but
the
bath
was
rather
refreshing
than
otherwise
we
turned
our
horses
heads
towards
the
jordan
and
rode
on
over
a
dry
barren
plain
the
two
bedouins
at
first
dashed
ahead
at
full
gallop
uttering
cries
and
whirling
their
long
guns
in
the
air
the
dust
they
raised
was
blown
in
our
faces
and
contained
so
much
salt
that
my
eyes
began
to
smart
painfully
thereupon
i
followed
them
at
an
equal
rate
of
speed
and
we
left
a
long
cloud
of
the
accursed
soil
whirling
behind
us
presently
however
they
fell
to
the
rear
and
continued
to
keep
at
some
distance
from
us
the
reason
of
this
was
soon
explained
the
path
turned
eastward
and
we
already
saw
a
line
of
dusky
green
winding
through
the
wilderness
this
was
the
jordan
and
the
mountains
beyond
the
home
of
robber
arabs
were
close
at
hand
those
robbers
frequently
cross
the
river
and
conceal
themselves
behind
the
on
this
side
our
brave
escort
was
therefore
inclined
to
put
us
forward
as
a
and
secure
their
own
retreat
in
case
of
an
attack
but
as
we
were
all
well
armed
and
had
never
considered
their
attendance
as
anything
more
than
a
genteel
way
of
buying
them
off
from
robbing
us
we
allowed
them
to
lag
as
much
as
they
chose
finally
as
we
approached
the
pilgrims
ford
one
of
them
took
his
station
at
some
distance
from
the
river
on
the
top
of
a
mound
while
the
other
got
behind
some
trees
near
at
hand
in
order
as
they
said
to
watch
the
opposite
hills
and
alarm
us
whenever
they
should
see
any
of
the
beni
sukrs
or
the
beni
adwams
or
the
tyakh
coming
down
upon
us
the
jordan
at
this
point
will
not
average
more
than
ten
yards
in
breadth
it
flows
at
the
bottom
of
a
gully
about
fifteen
feet
deep
which
traverses
the
broad
valley
in
a
most
tortuous
course
the
water
has
a
white
clayey
hue
and
is
very
swift
the
changes
of
the
current
have
formed
islands
and
beds
of
soil
here
and
there
which
are
covered
with
a
dense
growth
of
ash
poplar
willow
and
tamarisk
trees
the
banks
of
the
river
are
bordered
with
thickets
now
overgrown
with
wild
vines
and
fragrant
with
flowering
plants
birds
sing
continually
in
the
cool
dark
coverts
of
the
trees
i
found
a
singular
charm
in
the
wild
lonely
luxuriant
banks
the
tangled
undergrowth
and
the
rapid
brawling
course
of
the
sacred
stream
as
it
slipped
in
sight
and
out
of
sight
among
the
trees
it
is
almost
impossible
to
reach
the
water
at
any
other
point
than
the
ford
of
the
pilgrims
the
supposed
locality
of
the
passage
of
the
israelites
and
the
baptism
of
christ
the
plain
near
it
is
still
blackened
by
the
of
the
ten
thousand
pilgrims
who
went
down
from
jerusalem
three
weeks
ago
to
bathe
we
tied
our
horses
to
the
trees
and
prepared
to
follow
their
example
which
was
necessary
if
only
to
wash
off
the
iniquitous
slime
of
the
dead
sea
françois
in
the
meantime
filled
two
tin
flasks
from
the
stream
and
stowed
them
in
the
the
current
was
so
swift
that
one
could
not
venture
far
without
the
risk
of
being
carried
away
but
i
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
complete
and
most
refreshing
immersion
the
taint
of
gomorrah
was
not
entirely
washed
away
but
i
rode
off
with
as
great
a
sense
of
relief
as
if
the
baptism
had
been
a
moral
one
as
well
and
had
purified
me
from
sin
we
rode
for
nearly
two
hours
in
a
direction
to
the
bedouin
village
of
rihah
near
the
site
of
ancient
jericho
before
reaching
it
the
gray
salt
waste
vanishes
and
the
soil
is
covered
with
grass
and
herbs
the
barren
character
of
the
first
region
is
evidently
owing
to
deposits
from
the
vapors
of
the
dead
sea
as
they
are
blown
over
the
plain
by
the
south
wind
the
channels
of
streams
around
jericho
are
filled
with
nebbuk
trees
the
fruit
of
which
is
just
ripening
it
is
apparently
indigenous
and
grows
more
luxuriantly
than
on
the
white
nile
it
is
a
variety
of
the
and
is
set
down
by
botanists
as
the
spina
christi
of
which
the
saviour
mock
crown
of
thorns
was
made
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
this
as
the
twigs
are
long
and
pliant
and
armed
with
small
though
most
cruel
thorns
i
had
to
pay
for
gathering
some
of
the
fruit
with
a
torn
dress
and
bleeding
fingers
the
little
apples
which
it
bears
are
slightly
acid
and
excellent
for
alleviating
thirst
i
also
noticed
on
the
plain
a
variety
of
the
nightshade
with
large
berries
of
a
golden
color
the
spring
flowers
so
plentiful
now
in
all
other
parts
of
palestine
have
already
disappeared
from
the
valley
of
the
jordan
rihah
is
a
vile
little
village
of
tents
and
and
the
only
relic
of
antiquity
near
it
is
a
square
tower
which
may
possibly
be
of
the
time
of
herod
there
are
a
few
gardens
in
the
place
and
a
grove
of
superb
we
found
our
tent
already
pitched
beside
a
rill
which
issues
from
the
fountain
of
elisha
the
evening
was
very
sultry
and
the
musquitoes
gave
us
no
rest
we
purchased
some
milk
from
an
old
man
who
came
to
the
tent
but
such
was
his
mistrust
of
us
that
he
refused
to
let
us
keep
the
earthen
vessel
containing
it
until
morning
as
we
had
already
paid
the
money
to
his
son
we
would
not
let
him
take
the
milk
away
until
he
had
brought
the
money
back
he
then
took
a
dagger
from
his
waist
and
threw
it
before
us
as
security
while
he
carried
off
the
vessel
and
returned
the
price
i
have
frequently
seen
the
same
mistrustful
spirit
exhibited
in
egypt
our
two
bedouins
to
whom
i
gave
some
tobacco
in
the
evening
manifested
their
gratitude
by
stealing
the
remainder
of
our
stock
during
the
night
this
morning
we
followed
the
stream
to
its
source
the
fountain
of
elisha
so
called
as
being
probably
that
healed
by
the
prophet
if
so
the
healing
was
scarcely
complete
the
water
which
gushes
up
strong
and
free
at
the
foot
of
a
rocky
mound
is
warm
and
slightly
brackish
it
spreads
into
a
shallow
pool
shaded
by
a
fine
sycamore
tree
just
below
there
are
some
remains
of
old
walls
on
both
sides
and
the
stream
goes
roaring
away
through
a
rank
jungle
of
canes
fifteen
feet
in
height
the
precise
site
of
jericho
i
believe
has
not
been
fixed
but
the
city
of
the
palm
trees
as
it
was
called
was
probably
on
the
plain
near
some
mounds
which
rise
behind
the
fountain
here
there
are
occasional
traces
of
foundation
walls
but
so
ruined
as
to
give
no
clue
to
the
date
of
their
erection
further
towards
the
mountain
there
are
some
arches
which
appear
to
be
saracenic
as
we
ascended
again
into
the
i
observed
several
traces
of
cisterns
in
the
bottoms
of
ravines
which
collect
the
rains
herod
as
is
well
known
built
many
such
cisterns
near
jericho
where
he
had
a
palace
on
the
first
crest
to
which
we
climbed
there
is
part
of
a
roman
tower
yet
standing
the
view
looking
back
over
the
valley
of
jordan
is
magnificent
extending
from
the
dead
sea
to
the
mountains
of
gilead
beyond
the
country
of
ammon
i
thought
i
could
trace
the
point
where
the
river
yabbok
comes
down
from
mizpeh
of
gilead
to
join
the
jordan
the
wilderness
we
now
entered
was
fully
as
barren
but
less
rugged
than
that
through
which
we
passed
yesterday
the
path
ascended
along
the
brink
of
a
deep
gorge
at
the
bottom
of
which
a
little
stream
foamed
over
the
rocks
the
high
bleak
summits
towards
which
we
were
climbing
are
considered
by
some
biblical
geographers
to
be
mount

the
scene
of
christ
fasting
and
temptation
after
two
hours
we
reached
the
ruins
of
a
large
khan
or
hostlery
under
one
of
the
peaks
which
françois
stated
to
be
the
veritable
high
mountain
whence
the
devil
pointed
out
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
there
is
a
cave
in
the
rock
beside
the
road
which
the
superstitious
look
upon
as
the
orifice
out
of
which
his
satanic
majesty
issued
we
met
large
numbers
of
arab
families
with
their
flocks
descending
from
the
mountains
to
take
up
their
summer
residence
near
the
jordan
they
were
all
on
foot
except
the
young
children
and
goats
which
were
stowed
together
on
the
backs
of
donkeys
the
men
were
armed
and
appeared
to
be
of
the
same
tribe
as
our
escort
with
whom
they
had
a
good
understanding
the
morning
was
cold
and
cloudy
and
we
hurried
on
over
the
hills
to
a
fountain
in
the
valley
of
the
brook
kedron
where
we
breakfasted
before
we
had
reached
bethany
a
rain
came
down
and
the
sky
hung
dark
and
lowering
over
jerusalem
as
we
passed
the

of

it
still

jerusalem
will
soon
be
as

a

on

grand
tour
as
paris
or
naples
the
task
of
describing
it
is
already
next
to

so
thoroughly
has
the
topography
of
the
city
been
laid
down
by
the
surveys
of

the

there
is
little
more
left
for

the

places
which
can
be
authenticated
are
now
generally
accepted
and
the

even

there
still
remains
enough
to
make
the
place
sacred
in
the
eyes
of

the
city
stands
on
the
ancient
site
the
mount
of

looks
down
upon
it
the
foundations
of
the
temple
of

are
on

built
on
the
summit
ridge
of
the
of

just
where
it
begins
to
slope
eastward
not
half
a
mile
from
the
jaffa
gate
the
waters
run
towards
the
mediterranean
it
is
about
feet
above
the
latter
and
feet
above
the
dead
sea
to
which
the
descent
is
much
more
abrupt
the
hill
or
rather
group
of
small
mounts
on
which
jerusalem
stands
slants
eastward
to
the
brink
of
the
valley
of
jehosaphat
and
the
mount
of
olives
rises
opposite
from
the
sides
and
summit
of
which
one
sees
the
entire
city
spread
out
like
a
map
before
him
the
valley
of
hinnon
the
bed
of
which
is
on
a
much
higher
level
than
that
of
jehosaphat
skirts
the
and
southern
part
of
the
walls
and
drops
into
the
latter
valley
at
the
foot
of
mount
zion
the
most
southern
of
the
mounts
the
steep
slope
at
the
junction
of
the
two
valleys
is
the
site
of
the
city
of
the
jebusites
the
most
ancient
part
of
jerusalem
it
is
now
covered
with
the
present
wall
crossing
from
mount
zion
on
the
south
to
mount
moriah
on
the
east
a
little
glen
anciently
called
the
tyropeon
divides
the
mounts
and
winds
through
to
the
damascus
gate
on
the
north
though
from
the
height
of
the
walls
and
the
position
of
the
city
the
depression
which
it
causes
in
the
mass
of
buildings
is
not
very
perceptible
except
from
the
latter
point
moriah
is
the
lowest
of
the
mounts
and
hangs
directly
over
the
valley
of
jehosaphat
its
summit
was
built
up
by
solomon
so
as
to
form
a
quadrangular
terrace
five
hundred
by
three
hundred
yards
in
dimension
the
lower
courses
of
the
grand
wall
composed
of
huge
blocks
of
gray
conglomerate
limestone
still
remain
and
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
they
are
of
the
time
of
solomon
some
of
the
stones
are
of
enormous
size
i
noticed
several
which
were
fifteen
and
one
feet
in
length
the
upper
part
of
the
wall
was
restored
by
sultan
selim
the
conqueror
of
egypt
and
the
level
of
the
terrace
now
supports
the
great
mosque
of
omar
which
stands
on
the
very
site
of
the
temple
except
these
foundation
walls
the
damascus
gate
and
the
tower
of
hippicus
there
is
nothing
left
of
the
ancient
city
the
length
of
the
present
wall
of
circumference
is
about
two
miles
but
the
circuit
of
jerusalem
in
the
time
of
herod
was
probably
double
that
distance
the
best
views
of
the
city
are
from
the
mount
of
olives
and
the
hill
north
of
it
whence
titus
directed
the
siege
which
resulted
in
its
total
destruction
the
crusaders
under
godfrey
of
bouillon
encamped
on
the
same
hill
my
first
walk
after
reaching
here
was
to
the
summit
of
the
mount
of
olives
not
far
from
the
hotel
we
came
upon
the
via
dolorosa
up
which
according
to
catholic
tradition
christ
toiled
with
the
cross
upon
his
shoulders
i
found
it
utterly
impossible
to
imagine
that
i
was
walking
in
the
same
path
and
preferred
doubting
the
tradition
an
arch
is
built
across
the
street
at
the
spot
where
they
say
he
was
shown
to
the
populace
the
passage
is
steep
and
rough
descending
to
gate
by
the
governor
palace
which
stands
on
the
site
of
the
house
of
pontius
pilate
here
in
the
wall
forming
the
northern
part
of
the
foundation
of
the
temple
there
are
some
very
fine
remains
of
ancient
workmanship
from
the
city
wall
the
ground
descends
abruptly
to
the
valley
of
jehosaphat
the
turkish
residents
have
their
tombs
on
the
city
side
just
under
the
terrace
of
the
mosque
while
thousands
of
jews
find
a
peculiar
beatitude
in
having
themselves
interred
on
the
opposite
slope
of
the
mount
of
olives
which
is
in
some
places
quite
covered
with
their
crumbling
tombstones
the
bed
of
the
brook
kedron
is
now
dry
and
stony
a
sort
of
chapel
built
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
is
supposed
by
the
greeks
to
cover
the
tomb
of
the
virgin
a
claim
which
the
latins
consider
absurd
near
this
at
the
very
foot
of
the
mount
of
olives
the
latter
sect
have
lately
built
a
high
stone
wall
around
the
garden
of
gethsemane
for
the
purpose
apparently
of
protecting
the
five
aged
olives
i
am
ignorant
of
the
grounds
wherefore
gethsemane
is
placed
here
most
travellers
have
given
their
faith
to
the
spot
but
robinson
who
is
more
reliable
than
any
amount
of
mere
tradition
does
not
coincide
with
them
the
trees
do
not
appear
as
ancient
as
some
of
those
at
the
foot
of
mount
carmel
which
are
supposed
to
date
from
the
roman
colony
established
by
titus
moreover
it
is
well
known
that
at
the
time
of
the
taking
of
jerusalem
by
that
emperor
all
the
trees
for
many
miles
around
were
destroyed
the
therefore
can
not
be
those
under
which
christ
rested
even
supposing
this
to
be
the
true
site
of
gethseniane
the
mount
of
olives
is
a
steep
and
rugged
hill
dominating
over
the
city
and
the
surrounding
heights
it
is
still
covered
with
olive
orchards
and
planted
with
patches
of
grain
which
do
not
thrive
well
on
the
stony
soil
on
the
summit
is
a
mosque
with
a
minaret
attached
which
affords
a
grand
panoramic
view
as
we
reached
it
the
chief
of
the
college
of
dervishes
in
the
court
of
the
mosque
of
omar
came
out
with
a
number
of
attendants
he
saluted
us
courteously
which
would
not
have
been
the
case
had
he
been
the
superior
of
the
latin
convent
and
we
greek
monks
there
were
some
turkish
ladies
in
the
interior
of
the
mosque
so
that
we
could
not
gain
admittance
and
therefore
did
not
see
the
rock
containing
the
of
christ
who
according
to
moslem
tradition
ascended
to
heaven
from
this
spot
the
mohammedans
it
may
not
be
generally
known
accept
the
history
of
christ
except
his
crucifixion
believing
that
he
passed
to
heaven
without
death
another
person
being
crucified
in
his
stead
they
call
him
the
or
spirit
of
god
and
consider
him
after
mahomet
as
the
holiest
of
the
prophets
we
ascended
to
the
gallery
of
the
minaret
the
city
lay
opposite
so
fairly
spread
out
to
our
view
that
almost
every
house
might
be
separately
distinguished
it
is
a
mass
of
gray
buildings
with
and
but
for
the
mosques
of
omar
and
el
aksa
with
the
courts
and
galleries
around
them
would
be
exceedingly
tame
in
appearance
the
only
other
prominent
points
are
the
towers
of
the
holy
sepulchre
the
citadel
enclosing
herod
tower
and
the
mosque
on
mount
zion
the
turkish
wall
with
its
sharp
angles
its
square
bastions
and
the
long
embrasured
lines
of
its
parapet
is
the
most
striking
feature
of
the
view
stony
hills
stretch
away
from
the
city
on
all
sides
at
present
cheered
with
tracts
of
springing
wheat
but
later
in
the
season
brown
and
desolate
in
the
south
the
convent
of
elias
is
visible
and
part
of
the
little
town
of
bethlehem
i
passed
to
the
eastern
side
of
the
gallery
and
looking
thence
deep
down
among
the
sterile
mountains
beheld
a
long
sheet
of
blue
water
its
southern
extremity
vanishing
in
a
hot
sulphury
haze
the
mountains
of
ammon
and
moab
which
formed
the
background
of
my
first
view
of
jerusalem
leaned
like
a
vast
wall
against
the
sky
beyond
the
mysterious
sea
and
the
broad
valley
of
the
jordan
the
great
depression
of
this
valley
below
the
level
of
the
mediterranean
gives
it
a
most
remarkable
character
it
appears
even
deeper
than
is
actually
the
case
and
resembles
an
enormous
chasm
or
moat
separating
two
different
regions
of
the
earth
the
was
blowing
from
the
south
from
out
the
deserts
of
edom
and
threw
its
veil
of
fiery
vapor
over
the
landscape
the
muezzin
pointed
out
to
me
the
location
of
jericho
of
kerak
in
moab
and
in
the
country
of
ammon
ere
long
the
shadow
of
the
minaret
denoted
noon
and
placing
his
hands
on
both
sides
of
his
mouth
he
cried
out
first
on
the
south
side
towards
mecca
and
then
to
the
west
and
north
and
east
god
is
great
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
mohammed
is
his
prophet
let
us
prostrate
ourselves
before
him
and
to
him
alone
be
the
glory
jerusalem
internally
gives
no
impression
but
that
of
filth
ruin
poverty
and
degradation
there
are
two
or
three
streets
in
the
western
or
higher
portion
of
the
city
which
are
tolerably
clean
but
all
the
others
to
the
very
gates
of
the
holy
sepulchre
are
channels
of
pestilence
the
jewish
quarter
which
is
the
largest
so
sickened
and
disgusted
me
that
i
should
rather
go
the
whole
round
of
the
city
walls
than
pass
through
it
a
second
time
the
bazaars
are
poor
compared
with
those
of
other
oriental
cities
of
the
same
size
and
the
principal
trade
seems
to
be
in
rosaries
both
turkish
and
christian
crosses
seals
amulets
and
pieces
of
the
holy
sepulchre
the
population
which
may
possibly
reach
is
apparently
jewish
for
the
most
part
at
least
i
have
been
principally
struck
with
the
hebrew
face
in
my
walks
the
number
of
jews
has
increased
considerably
within
a
few
years
and
there
is
also
quite
a
number
who
having
been
converted
to
protestantism
were
brought
hither
at
the
expense
of
english
missionary
societies
for
the
purpose
of
forming
a
protestant
community
two
of
the
hotels
are
kept
by
families
of
this
class
it
is
estimated
that
each
member
of
the
community
has
cost
the
mission
about
a
sum
which
would
have
christianized
tenfold
the
number
of
english
heathen
the
mission
however
is
kept
up
by
its
patrons
as
a
sort
of
religious
luxury
the
english
have
lately
built
a
very
handsome
church
within
the
walls
and
the
rev
gobat
well
known
by
his
missionary
labors
in
abyssinia
now
has
the
title
of
bishop
of
jerusalem
a
friend
of
his
in
central
africa
gave
me
a
letter
of
introduction
for
him
and
i
am
quite
disappointed
in
finding
him
absent
barclay
of
virginia
a
most
worthy
man
in
every
respect
is
at
the
head
of
the
american
mission
here
there
is
besides
what
is
called
the
american
colony
at
the
village
of
artos
near
bethlehem
a
little
community
of
religious
enthusiasts
whose
experiments
in
cultivation
have
met
with
remarkable
success
and
are
much
spoken
of
at
present
whatever
good
the
various
missions
here
may
in
time
accomplish
at
present
it
does
not
amount
to
much
jerusalem
is
the
last
place
in
the
world
where
an
intelligent
heathen
would
be
converted
to
christianity
were
i
cast
here
ignorant
of
any
religion
and
were
i
to
compare
the
lives
and
practices
of
the
different
sects
as
the
means
of
making
my
choice
in
short
to
judge
of
each
faith
by
the
conduct
of
its
professors
i
should
at
once
turn
mussulman
when
you
consider
that
in
the
holy
sepulchre
there
are
chapels
each
belonging
to
a
different
sect
calling
itself
christian
and
that
a
turkish
police
is
always
stationed
there
to
prevent
the
bloody
quarrels
which
often
ensue
between
them
you
may
judge
how
those
who
call
themselves
followers
of
the
prince
of
peace
practice
the
pure
faith
he
sought
to
establish
between
the
greek
and
latin
churches
especially
there
is
a
deadly
feud
and
their
contentions
are
a
scandal
not
only
to
the
few
christians
here
but
to
the
moslems
themselves
i
believe
there
is
a
sort
of
truce
at
present
owing
to
the
settlement
of
some
of
the
disputes
as
for
instance
the
restoration
of
the
silver
star
which
the
greeks
stole
from
the
shrine
of
the
nativity
at
bethlehem
the
latins
however
not
long
since
demolished
et
a
chapel
which
the
greeks
commenced
building
on
mount
zion
but
if
the
employment
of
material
weapons
has
been
abandoned
for
the
time
there
is
none
the
less
a
war
of
words
and
of
sounds
still
going
on
go
into
the
holy
sepulchre
when
mass
is
being
celebrated
and
you
can
scarcely
endure
the
din
no
sooner
does
the
greek
choir
begin
its
shrill
chant
than
the
latins
fly
to
the
assault
they
have
an
organ
and
terribly
does
that
organ
strain
its
bellows
and
labor
its
pipes
to
drown
the
rival
singing
you
think
the
latins
will
carry
the
day
when
suddenly
the
cymbals
of
the
abyssinians
strike
in
with
harsh
brazen
clang
and
for
the
moment
triumph
then
there
are
copts
and
maronites
and
armenians
and
i
know
not
how
many
other
sects
who
must
have
their
share
and
the
service
that
should
be
a
harmony
pervaded
by
one
grand
spirit
of
devotion
becomes
a
discordant
orgie
befitting
the
rites
of
belial
a
long
time
ago
i
do
not
know
the
precise
number
of
years
the
sultan
granted
a
firman
in
answer
to
the
application
of
both
jews
and
christians
allowing
the
members
of
each
sect
to
put
to
death
any
person
belonging
to
the
other
sect
who
should
be
found
inside
of
their
churches
or
synagogues
the
firman
has
never
been
recalled
though
in
every
place
but
jerusalem
it
remains
a
dead
letter
here
although
the
jews
freely
permit
christians
to
enter
their
synagogue
a
jew
who
should
enter
the
holy
sepulchre
would
be
lucky
if
he
escaped
with
his
life
not
long
since
an
english
gentleman
who
was
taken
by
the
monks
for
a
jew
was
so
severely
beaten
that
he
was
confined
to
his
bed
for
two
months
what
worse
than
scandal
what
abomination
that
the
spot
looked
upon
by
so
many
christians
as
the
most
awfully
sacred
on
earth
should
be
the
scene
of
such
brutish
intolerance
i
never
pass
the
group
of
turkish
officers
quietly
smoking
their
long
pipes
and
sipping
their
coffee
within
the
vestibule
of
the
church
without
a
feeling
of
humiliation
worse
than
the
whom
christ
scourged
out
of
the
temple
the
guardians
of
this
edifice
make
use
of
his
crucifixion
and
resurrection
as
a
means
of
gain
you
may
buy
a
piece
of
the
stone
covering
the
holy
sepulchre
duly
certified
by
the
greek
patriarch
of
jerusalem
for
about
at
bethlehem
which
i
visited
this
morning
the
latin
monk
who
showed
us
the
manger
the
pit
where
innocents
were
buried
and
other
things
had
much
less
to
say
of
the
sacredness
or
authenticity
of
the
place
than
of
the
injustice
of
allowing
the
greeks
a
share
in
its
possession
the
native
jewish
families
in
jerusalem
as
well
as
those
in
other
parts
of
palestine
present
a
marked
difference
to
the
jews
of
europe
and
america
they
possess
the
same
physical
characteristics
the
dark
oblong
eye
the
prominent
nose
the
cheek
and
jaw
but
in
the
latter
these
traits
have
become
harsh
and
coarse
centuries
devoted
to
the
lowest
and
most
debasing
forms
of
traffic
with
the
endurance
of
persecution
and
contumely
have
greatly
changed
and
vulgarized
the
appearance
of
the
race
but
the
jews
of
the
holy
city
still
retain
a
noble
beauty
which
proved
to
my
mind
their
descent
from
the
ancient
princely
houses
of
israel
the
forehead
is
loftier
the
eye
larger
and
more
frank
in
its
expression
the
nose
more
delicate
in
its
prominence
and
the
face
a
purer
oval
i
have
remarked
the
same
distinction
in
the
countenances
of
those
jewish
families
of
europe
whose
members
have
devoted
themselves
to
art
or
literature
mendelssohn
was
a
face
that
might
have
belonged
to
the
house
of
david
on
the
evening
of
my
arrival
in
the
city
as
i
set
out
to
walk
through
the
bazaars
i
encountered
a
native
jew
whose
face
will
haunt
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
was
sauntering
slowly
along
asking
myself
is
this
jerusalem
when
lifting
my
eyes
they
met
those
of
christ
it
was
the
very
face
which
raphael
has
painted
the
traditional
features
of
the
saviour
as
they
are
recognised
and
accepted
by
all
christendom
the
waving
brown
hair
partly
hidden
by
a
jewish
cap
fell
clustering
about
the
ears
the
face
was
the
most
perfect
oval
and
almost
feminine
in
the
purity
of
its
outline
the
serene
mouth
was
shaded
with
a
light
moustache
and
a
silky
brown
beard
clothed
the
chin
but
the
eyes
shall
i
ever
look
into
such
orbs
again
large
dark
unfathomable
they
beamed
with
an
expression
of
divine
love
and
divine
sorrow
such
as
i
never
before
saw
in
human
face
the
man
had
just
emerged
from
a
dark
archway
and
the
golden
glow
of
the
sunset
reflected
from
a
white
wall
above
fell
upon
his
face
perhaps
it
was
this
transfiguration
which
made
his
beauty
so
unearthly
but
during
the
moment
that
i
saw
him
he
was
to
me
a
revelation
of
the
saviour
there
are
still
miracles
in
the
land
of
judah
as
the
dusk
gathered
in
the
deep
streets
i
could
see
nothing
but
the
ineffable
sweetness
and
benignity
of
that
countenance
and
my
friend
was
not
a
little
astonished
if
not
shocked
when
i
said
to
him
with
the
earnestness
of
belief
on
my
return
i
have
just
seen
christ
i
made
the
round
of
the
holy
sepulchre
on
sunday
while
the
monks
were
celebrating
the
festival
of
the
invention
of
the
cross
in
the
chapel
of
the
empress
helena
as
the
finding
of
the
cross
by
the
empress
is
almost
the
only
authority
for
the
places
inclosed
within
the
holy
sepulchre
i
went
there
inclined
to
doubt
their
authenticity
and
came
away
with
my
doubt
vastly
strengthened
the
building
is
a
confused
labyrinth
of
chapels
choirs
shrines
staircases
and
vaults
without
any
definite
plan
or
any
architectural
beauty
though
very
rich
in
parts
and
full
of
picturesque
effects
golden
lamps
continually
burn
before
the
sacred
places
and
you
rarely
visit
the
church
without
seeing
some
procession
of
monks
with
crosses
censers
and
tapers
threading
the
shadowy
passages
from
shrine
to
shrine
it
is
astonishing
how
many
localities
are
assembled
under
one
roof
at
first
you
are
shown
the
stone
on
which
christ
rested
from
the
burden
of
the
cross
then
the
place
where
the
soldiers
cast
lots
for
his
garments
both
of
them
adjoining
the
sepulchre
after
seeing
this
you
are
taken
to
the
pillar
of
flagellation
the
stocks
the
place
of
crowning
with
thorns
the
spot
where
he
met
his
mother
the
cave
where
the
empress
helena
found
the
cross
and
lastly
the
summit
of
mount
calvary
the
sepulchre
is
a
small
marble
building
in
the
centre
of
the
church
we
removed
our
shoes
at
the
entrance
and
were
taken
by
a
greek
monk
first
into
a
sort
of
lighted
with
golden
lamps
and
having
in
the
centre
inclosed
in
a
case
of
marble
the
stone
on
which
the
angel
sat
stooping
through
a
low
door
we
entered
the
sepulchre
itself
forty
lamps
of
gold
burn
unceasingly
above
the
white
marble
slab
which
as
the
monks
say
protects
the
stone
whereon
the
body
of
christ
was
laid
as
we
again
emerged
our
guide
led
us
up
a
flight
of
steps
to
a
second
story
in
which
stood
a
shrine
literally
blazing
with
gold
kneeling
on
the
marble
floor
he
removed
a
golden
shield
and
showed
us
the
hole
in
the
rock
of
calvary
where
the
cross
was
planted
close
beside
it
was
the
fissure
produced
by
the
earthquake
which
followed
the
crucifixion
but
to
my
eyes
aided
by
the
light
of
the
dim
wax
taper
it
was
no
violent
rupture
such
as
an
earthquake
would
produce
and
the
rock
did
not
appear
to
be
the
same
as
that
of
which
jerusalem
is
built
as
we
turned
to
leave
a
monk
appeared
with
a
bowl
of
sacred
which
he
sprinkled
on
our
hands
bestowing
a
double
portion
on
a
rosary
of
which
i
carried
but
it
was
a
mohammedan
rosary
brought
from
mecca
and
containing
the
sacred
number
of
beads
i
have
not
space
here
to
state
all
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
localities
in
the
holy
sepulchre
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
none
of
them
were
authentic
and
am
glad
to
have
the
concurrence
of
such
distinguished
authority
as
robinson
so
far
from
this
being
a
matter
of
regret
i
for
one
rejoice
that
those
sacred
spots
are
lost
to
the
world
christianity
does
not
need
them
and
they
are
spared
a
daily
profanation
in
the
name
of
religion
we
know
that
christ
has
walked
on
the
mount
of
olives
and
gone
down
to
the
pool
of
siloam
and
tarried
in
bethany
we
know
that
here
within
the
circuit
of
our
vision
he
has
suffered
agony
and
death
and
that
from
this
little
point
went
out
all
the
light
that
has
made
the
world
greater
and
happier
and
better
in
its
later
than
in
its
earlier
days
yet
i
must
frankly
confess
in
wandering
through
this
city
revered
alike
by
christians
jews
and
turks
as
one
of
the
holiest
in
the
world
i
have
been
reminded
of
christ
the
man
rather
than
of
christ
the
god
in
the
glory
which
overhangs
palestine
afar
off
we
imagine
emotions
which
never
come
when
we
tread
the
soil
and
walk
over
the
hallowed
sites
as
i
toiled
up
the
mount
of
olives
in
the
very
footsteps
of
christ
panting
with
the
heat
and
the
difficult
ascent
i
found
it
utterly
impossible
to
conceive
that
the
deity
in
human
form
had
walked
there
before
me
and
even
at
night
as
i
walk
on
the
terraced
roof
while
the
moon
the
balmy
moon
of
blessed
israel
restores
the
jerusalem
of
olden
days
to
my
imagination
the
saviour
who
then
haunts
my
thoughts
is
the
man
jesus
in
those
moments
of
trial
when
he
felt
the
weaknesses
of
our
common
humanity
in
that
agony
of
struggle
in
the
garden
of
gethsemane
in
that
still
more
bitter
cry
of
human
doubt
and
human
appeal
from
the
cross
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
yet
there
is
no
reproach
for
this
conception
of
the
character
of
christ
better
the
man
the
purest
and
most
perfect
of
his
race
the
pattern
and
type
of
all
that
is
good
and
holy
in
humanity
than
the
deity
for
whose
intercession
we
pray
while
we
trample
his
teachings
under
our
feet
it
would
be
well
for
many
christian
sects
did
they
keep
more
constantly
before
their
eyes
the
sublime
humanity
of
christ
how
much
bitter
intolerance
and
persecution
might
be
spared
the
world
if
instead
of
simply
adoring
him
as
a
divine
mediator
they
would
strive
to
walk
the
ways
he
trod
on
earth
but
christianity
is
still
undeveloped
and
there
is
yet
no
sect
which
represents
its
fall
and
perfect
spirit
it
is
my
misfortune
if
i
give
offence
by
these
remarks
i
can
not
assume
emotions
i
do
not
feel
and
must
describe
jerusalem
as
i
found
it
since
being
here
i
have
read
the
accounts
of
several
travellers
and
in
many
cases
the
devotional
rhapsodies
the
ecstacies
of
awe
and
reverence
in
which
they
indulge
strike
me
as
forced
and
affected
the
pious
writers
have
described
what
was
expected
of
them
not
what
they
found
it
was
partly
from
reading
such
accounts
that
my
anticipations
were
raised
too
high
for
the
view
of
the
city
from
the
jaffa
road
and
the
panorama
from
the
mount
of
olives
are
the
only
things
wherein
i
have
been
pleasantly
disappointed
by
far
the
most
interesting
relic
left
to
the
city
is
the
foundation
wall
of
solomon
temple
the
mosque
of
omar
according
to
the
accounts
of
the
turks
and
mr
gather
wood
examination
rests
on
immense
vaults
which
are
believed
to
be
the
substructions
of
the
temple
itself
under
the
dome
of
the
mosque
there
is
a
large
mass
of
natural
rock
revered
by
the
moslems
as
that
from
which
mahomet
mounted
the
beast
borak
when
he
visited
the
seven
heavens
and
believed
by
catherwood
to
have
served
as
part
of
the
foundation
of
the
holy
of
holies
no
christian
is
allowed
to
enter
the
mosque
or
even
its
enclosure
on
penalty
of
death
and
even
the
firman
of
the
sultan
has
failed
to
obtain
admission
for
a
frank
i
have
been
strongly
tempted
to
make
the
attempt
in
my
egyptian
dress
which
happens
to
resemble
that
of
a
mollah
or
moslem
priest
but
the
dervishes
in
the
adjoining
college
have
sharp
eyes
and
my
pronunciation
of
arabic
would
betray
me
in
case
i
was
accosted
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
buy
a
string
of
the
large
beads
usually
carried
by
a
mollah
but
unluckily
i
do
not
know
the
moslem
form
of
prayer
or
i
might
carry
out
the
plan
under
the
guise
of
religious
abstraction
this
morning
we
succeeded
in
getting
a
nearer
view
of
the
mosque
from
the
roof
of
the
governor
palace
françois
by
assuming
the
character
of
a
turkish
gained
us
admission
the
roof
overlooks
the
entire
enclosure
of
the
haram
and
gives
a
complete
view
of
the
exterior
of
the
mosque
and
the
paved
court
surrounding
it
there
is
no
regularity
in
the
style
of
the
buildings
in
the
enclosure
but
the
general
effect
is
highly
picturesque
the
great
dome
of
the
mosque
is
the
grandest
in
all
the
orient
but
the
body
of
the
edifice
made
to
resemble
an
octagonal
tent
and
covered
with
blue
and
white
tiles
is
not
high
enough
to
do
it
justice
the
first
court
is
paved
with
marble
and
has
four
porticoes
each
of
five
light
saracenic
arches
opening
into
the
green
park
which
occupies
the
rest
of
the
terrace
this
park
is
studded
with
cypress
and
fig
trees
and
dotted
all
over
with
the
tombs
of
shekhs
as
we
were
looking
down
on
the
spacious
area
behold
who
should
come
along
but
shekh
mohammed
senoosee
the
holy
man
of
timbuctoo
who
had
laid
off
his
scarlet
robe
and
donned
a
green
one
i
called
down
to
him
whereupon
he
looked
up
and
recognised
us
for
this
reason
i
regret
our
departure
from
jerusalem
as
i
am
sure
a
little
persuasion
would
induce
the
holy
man
to
accompany
me
within
the
mosque
we
leave
for
damascus
by
way
of
nazareth
and
tiberius
my
original
plan
was
to
have
gone
to
djerash
the
ancient
geraza
in
the
land
of
gilead
and
thence
to
bozrah
in
djebel
hauaran
but
djebel
adjeloun
as
the
country
about
djerash
is
called
is
under
a
powerful
bedouin
shekh
named
azeez
and
without
an
escort
from
him
which
involves
considerable
delay
and
a
fee
of
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
the
journey
we
are
therefore
restricted
to
the
ordinary
route
and
in
case
we
should
meet
with
any
difficulty
by
the
way

sky
was
a
sheet
of
spotless
blue
every
rift
and
scar
of
the
distant
hills
was
retouched
with
a
firmer
pencil
and
all
the
outlines
blurred
away
by
the
haze
of
the
previous
few
days
were
restored
with
wonderful
distinctness
the
temperature
was
hot
but
not
sultry
and
the
air
we
breathed
was
an
elixir
of
immortality
through
a
luxuriant
olive
grove
we
reached
the
tombs
of
the
kings
situated
in
a
small
valley
to
the
north
of
the
city
part
of
the
valley
if
not
the
whole
of
it
has
been
formed
by
quarrying
away
the
crags
of
marble
and
conglomerate
limestone
for
building
the
city
near
the
edge
of
the
low
cliffs
overhanging
it
there
are
some
illustrations
of
the
ancient
mode
of
cutting
stone
which
as
well
as
the
custom
of
excavating
tombs
in
the
rock
was
evidently
borrowed
from
egypt
the
upper
surface
of
the
rocks
was
first
made
smooth
after
which
the
blocks
were
mapped
out
and
cut
apart
by
grooves
chiselled
between
them
i
visited
four
or
five
tombs
each
of
which
had
a
sort
of
vestibule
or
open
portico
in
front
the
door
was
low
and
the
chambers
which
i
entered
small
and
black
without
sculptures
of
any
kind
the
tombs
bear
some
resemblance
in
their
general
plan
to
those
of
thebes
except
that
they
are
without
ornaments
either
sculptured
or
painted
there
are
fragments
of
sarcophagi
in
some
of
them
on
the
southern
side
of
the
valley
is
a
large
quarry
evidently
worked
for
marble
as
the
blocks
have
been
cut
out
from
below
leaving
a
large
overhanging
mass
part
of
which
has
broken
off
and
fallen
down
some
pieces
which
i
picked
up
were
of
a
very
fine
white
marble
somewhat
resembling
that
of
carrara
the
opening
of
the
quarry
made
a
striking
picture
the
soft
pink
hue
of
the
rock
contrasting
exquisitely
with
the
vivid
green
of
the
vines
festooning
the
entrance
from
the
long
hill
beyond
the
tombs
we
took
our
last
view
of
jerusalem
far
beyond
whose
walls
i
saw
the
church
of
the
nativity
at
bethlehem
the
jewish
synagogue
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
called
nebbee
samwil
the
highest
peak
in
palestine
was
visible
at
some
distance
to
the
west
notwithstanding
its
sanctity
i
felt
little
regret
at
leaving
jerusalem
and
cheerfully
took
the
rough
road
northward
over
the
stony
hills
there
were
few
habitations
in
sight
yet
the
were
cultivated
wherever
it
was
possible
for
anything
to
grow
the
wheat
was
just
coming
into
head
and
the
people
were
at
work
planting
maize
after
four
ride
we
reached
el
bireh
a
little
village
on
a
hill
with
the
ruins
of
a
convent
and
a
large
khan
the
place
takes
its
name
from
a
fountain
of
excellent
water
beside
which
we
found
our
tents
already
pitched
in
the
evening
two
englishmen
an
ancient
mentor
with
a
wild
young
telemachus
in
charge
arrived
and
camped
near
us
the
night
was
calm
and
cool
and
the
full
moon
poured
a
flood
of
light
over
the
bare
and
silent
hills
we
rose
long
before
sunrise
and
rode
off
in
the
brilliant
morning
the
sky
unstained
by
a
speck
of
vapor
in
the
valley
beyond
el
bireh
the
husbandmen
were
already
at
their
ploughs
and
the
village
boys
were
on
their
way
to
the
uncultured
parts
of
the
hills
with
their
flocks
of
sheep
and
goats
the
valley
terminated
in
a
deep
gorge
with
perpendicular
walls
of
rock
on
either
side
our
road
mounted
the
hill
on
the
eastern
side
and
followed
the
brink
of
the
precipice
through
the
pass
where
an
enchanting
landscape
opened
upon
us
the
village
of
yebrood
crowned
a
hill
which
rose
opposite
and
the
mountain
slopes
leaning
towards
it
on
all
sides
were
covered
with
orchards
of
fig
trees
and
either
rustling
with
wheat
or
cleanly
ploughed
for
maize
the
soil
was
a
dark
brown
loam
and
very
rich
the
stones
have
been
laboriously
built
into
terraces
and
even
where
heavy
rocky
boulders
almost
hid
the
soil
young
fig
and
olive
trees
were
planted
in
the
crevices
between
them
i
have
never
seen
more
thorough
and
patient
cultivation
in
the
crystal
of
the
morning
air
the
very
hills
laughed
with
plenty
and
the
whole
landscape
beamed
with
the
signs
of
gladness
on
its
countenance
the
site
of
ancient
bethel
was
not
far
to
the
right
of
our
road
over
hills
laden
with
the
olive
fig
and
vine
we
passed
to
ain
or
the
fountain
of
the
bobbers
here
there
are
tombs
cut
in
the
rock
on
both
sides
of
the
valley
over
another
ridge
we
descended
to
a
large
valley
entirely
covered
with
wheat
and
opening
eastward
towards
the
jordan
thence
to
nablous
the
shechem
of
the
old
and
sychar
of
the
new
testament
is
four
hours
through
a
winding
dell
of
the
richest
harvest
land
on
the
way
we
first
caught
sight
of
the
snowy
top
of
mount
hermon
distant
at
least
eighty
miles
in
a
straight
line
before
reaching
nablous
i
stopped
to
drink
at
a
fountain
of
clear
and
sweet
water
beside
a
square
pile
of
masonry
upon
which
sat
two
moslem
dervishes
this
we
were
told
was
the
tomb
of
joseph
whose
body
after
having
accompanied
the
israelites
in
all
their
wanderings
was
at
last
deposited
near
shechem
there
is
less
reason
to
doubt
this
spot
than
most
of
the
sacred
places
of
palestine
for
the
reason
that
it
rests
not
on
christian
but
on
jewish
tradition
the
wonderful
tenacity
with
which
the
jews
cling
to
every
record
or
memento
of
their
early
history
and
the
fact
that
from
the
time
of
joseph
a
portion
of
them
have
always
lingered
near
the
spot
render
it
highly
probable
that
the
locality
of
a
spot
so
sacred
should
have
been
preserved
from
generation
to
generation
to
the
present
time
it
has
been
recently
proposed
to
open
this
tomb
by
digging
under
it
from
the
side
if
the
body
of
joseph
was
actually
deposited
here
there
are
no
doubt
some
traces
of
it
remaining
it
must
have
been
embalmed
according
to
the
egyptian
custom
and
placed
in
a
coffin
of
the
indian
sycamore
the
wood
of
which
is
so
nearly
incorruptible
that
centuries
would
not
suffice
for
its
decomposition
the
singular
interest
of
such
a
discovery
would
certainly
justify
the
experiment
not
far
from
the
tomb
is
jacob
well
where
christ
met
the
woman
of
samaria
this
place
is
also
considered
as
authentic
for
the
same
reasons
if
not
wholly
convincing
to
all
there
is
at
least
so
much
probability
in
them
that
one
is
freed
from
that
painful
coldness
and
incredulity
with
which
he
beholds
the
sacred
shows
of
jerusalem
leaving
the
tomb
of
joseph
the
road
turned
to
the
west
and
entered
the
narrow
pass
between
mounts
ebal
and
gerizim
the
former
is
a
steep
barren
peak
clothed
with
terraces
of
cactus
standing
on
the
northern
side
of
the
pass
mount
gerizim
is
cultivated
nearly
to
the
top
and
is
truly
a
mountain
of
blessing
compared
with
its
neighbor
through
an
orchard
of
grand
old
we
reached
nablous
which
presented
a
charming
picture
with
its
long
mass
of
white
stone
houses
stretching
along
the
foot
of
gerizim
through
a
sea
of
bowery
orchards
the
bottom
of
the
valley
resembles
some
old
garden
run
to
waste
abundant
streams
poured
from
the
generous
heart
of
the
mount
of
blessing
leap
and
gurgle
with
pleasant
noises
through
thickets
of
orange
fig
and
pomegranate
through
bowers
of
roses
and
tangled
masses
of
briars
and
wild
vines
we
halted
in
a
grove
of
olives
and
after
our
tent
was
pitched
walked
upward
through
the
orchards
to
the
promontory
of
the
fountain
on
the
side
of
mount
gerizim
a
multitude
of
beggars
sat
at
the
city
gate
and
as
they
continued
to
clamor
after
i
had
given
sufficient
alms
i
paid
them
with
god
give
it
to
you
the
moslem
reply
to
such
importunity
and
they
ceased
in
an
instant
this
exclamation
it
seems
takes
away
from
them
the
power
of
demanding
a
second
time
from
under
the
gushes
forth
the
fountain
of
honey
so
called
from
the
sweetness
and
purity
of
the
water
we
drank
of
it
and
i
found
the
taste
very
agreeable
but
my
companion
declared
that
it
had
an
unpleasant
woolly
flavor
when
we
climbed
a
little
higher
we
found
that
the
true
source
from
which
the
fountain
is
supplied
was
above
and
that
an
arab
was
washing
a
flock
of
sheep
in
it
we
continued
our
walk
along
the
side
of
the
mountain
to
the
other
end
of
the
city
through
gardens
of
almond
apricot
prune
and
bound
each
to
each
by
great
vines
whose
heavy
arms
they
seemed
barely
able
to
support
the
interior
of
the
town
is
dark
and
filthy
but
it
has
a
long
busy
bazaar
extending
its
whole
length
and
a
café
where
we
procured
the
best
coffee
in
syria
nablous
is
noted
for
the
existence
of
a
small
remnant
of
the
ancient
samaritans
the
stock
has
gradually
dwindled
away
and
amounts
to
only
forty
families
containing
little
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
individuals
they
live
in
a
particular
quarter
of
the
city
and
are
easily
distinguished
from
the
other
inhabitants
by
the
cast
of
their
features
after
our
guide
a
native
of
nablous
had
pointed
out
three
or
four
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
all
the
others
we
met
they
have
long
but
not
prominent
noses
like
the
jews
small
oblong
eyes
narrow
lips
and
fair
complexions
most
of
them
having
brown
hair
they
appear
to
be
held
in
considerable
obloquy
by
the
moslems
our
attendant
who
was
of
the
low
class
of
arabs
took
the
boys
we
met
very
unceremoniously
by
the
head
calling
out
here
is
another
samaritan
he
then
conducted
us
to
their
synagogue
to
see
the
celebrated
pentateuch
which
is
there
preserved
we
were
taken
to
a
small
open
court
shaded
by
an
where
the
priest
an
old
man
in
a
green
robe
and
white
turban
was
seated
in
meditation
he
had
a
long
grey
beard
and
black
eyes
that
lighted
up
with
a
sudden
expression
of
eager
greed
when
we
promised
him
backsheesh
for
a
sight
of
the
sacred
book
he
arose
and
took
us
into
a
sort
of
chapel
followed
by
a
number
of
samaritan
boys
kneeling
down
at
a
niche
in
the
wall
he
produced
from
behind
a
wooden
case
a
piece
of
ragged
parchment
written
with
hebrew
characters
but
the
guide
was
familiar
with
this
deception
and
rated
him
so
soundly
that
after
a
little
hesitation
he
laid
the
fragment
away
and
produced
a
large
tin
cylinder
covered
with
a
piece
of
green
satin
embroidered
in
gold
the
boys
stooped
down
and
reverently
kissed
the
blazoned
cover
before
it
was
removed
the
cylinder
sliding
open
by
two
rows
of
hinges
opened
at
the
same
time
the
parchment
scroll
which
was
rolled
at
both
ends
it
was
indeed
a
very
ancient
manuscript
and
in
remarkable
preservation
the
rents
have
been
carefully
repaired
and
the
scroll
neatly
stitched
upon
another
piece
of
parchment
covered
on
the
outside
with
violet
satin
the
priest
informed
me
that
it
was
written
by
the
son
of
aaron
but
this
does
not
coincide
with
the
fact
that
the
samaritan
pentateuch
is
different
from
that
of
the
jews
it
is
however
no
doubt
one
of
the
oldest
parchment
records
in
the
world
and
the
samaritans
look
upon
it
with
unbounded
faith
and
reverence
the
pentateuch
according
to
their
version
contains
their
only
form
of
religion
they
reject
everything
else
which
the
old
testament
contains
three
or
four
days
ago
was
their
grand
feast
of
sacrifice
when
they
made
a
burnt
offering
of
a
lamb
on
the
top
of
mount
gerizim
within
a
short
time
it
is
said
they
have
shown
some
curiosity
to
become
acquainted
with
the
new
testament
and
the
high
priest
sent
to
jerusalem
to
procure
arabic
copies
i
asked
one
of
the
boys
whether
he
could
read
the
sacred
book
oh
yes
said
the
priest
all
these
boys
can
read
it
and
the
one
i
addressed
immediately
pulled
a
volume
from
his
breast
and
commenced
reading
in
fluent
hebrew
it
appeared
to
be
a
part
of
their
church
service
for
both
the
priest
and
or
kept
up
a
running
series
of
responses
and
occasionally
the
whole
crowd
shouted
out
some
word
in
chorus
the
old
man
leaned
forward
with
an
expression
as
fixed
and
intense
as
if
the
text
had
become
incarnate
in
him
following
with
his
lips
the
sound
of
the
boy
voice
it
was
a
strange
picture
of
religious
enthusiasm
and
was
of
itself
sufficient
to
convince
me
of
the
legitimacy
of
the
samaritan
descent
when
i
rose
to
leave
i
gave
him
the
promised
fee
and
a
smaller
one
to
the
boy
who
read
the
service
this
was
the
signal
for
a
general
attack
from
the
and
all
the
boys
who
were
present
they
surrounded
me
with
eyes
sparkling
with
the
desire
of
gain
kissed
the
border
of
my
jacket
stroked
my
beard
coaxingly
with
their
hands
which
they
then
kissed
and
crowding
up
with
a
boisterous
show
of
affection
were
about
to
fall
on
my
neck
in
a
heap
after
the
old
hebrew
fashion
the
priest
clamorous
for
more
followed
with
glowing
face
and
the
whole
group
had
a
riotous
and
bacchanalian
character
which
i
should
never
have
imagined
could
spring
from
such
a
passion
as
avarice
on
returning
to
our
camp
we
found
mentor
and
telemachus
arrived
but
not
on
such
friendly
terms
as
their
greek
prototypes
we
were
kept
awake
for
a
long
time
that
night
by
their
high
words
and
the
first
sound
i
heard
the
next
morning
came
from
their
tent
telemachus
i
suspect
had
found
some
island
of
calypso
and
did
not
relish
the
cold
shock
of
the
plunge
into
the
sea
by
which
mentor
had
forced
him
away
he
insisted
on
returning
to
jerusalem
but
as
mentor
would
not
allow
him
a
horse
he
had
not
the
courage
to
try
it
on
foot
after
a
series
of
altercations
in
which
he
took
a
pistol
to
shoot
the
dragoman
and
applied
very
profane
terms
to
everybody
in
the
company
his
wrath
dissolved
into
tears
and
when
we
left
mentor
had
decided
to
rest
a
day
at
nablous
and
let
him
recover
from
the
effects
of
the
storm
we
rode
down
the
beautiful
valley
taking
the
road
to
sebaste
samaria
while
our
kept
directly
over
the
mountains
to
jenin
our
path
at
first
followed
the
course
of
the
stream
between
turfy
banks
and
through
luxuriant
orchards
the
whole
country
we
overlooked
was
planted
with
and
except
the
very
summits
of
the
mountains
covered
with
for
two
hours
our
course
was
leading
over
the
hills
and
now
and
then
dipping
into
beautiful
dells
in
one
of
these
a
large
stream
gushes
from
the
earth
in
a
full
fountain
at
the
foot
of
a
great
the
above
it
was
a
complete
mass
of
foliage
crowned
with
the
white
walls
of
a
syrian
village
descending
the
valley
which
is
very
deep
we
came
in
sight
of
samaria
situated
on
the
summit
of
an
isolated
hill
the
sanctuary
of
the
ancient
christian
church
of
john
towers
high
above
the
mud
walls
of
the
modern
village
riding
between
and
of
glorious
richness
and
beauty
we
passed
the
remains
of
an
acqueduct
and
ascended
the
hill
the
ruins
of
the
church
occupy
the
eastern
summit
part
of
them
have
been
converted
into
a
mosque
which
the
christian
foot
is
not
allowed
to
profane
the
church
which
is
in
the
byzantine
style
is
apparently
of
the
time
of
the
crusaders
it
had
originally
a
central
and
two
covered
with
groined
gothic
vaults
the
sanctuary
is
with
a
row
of
small
arches
supported
by
double
pillars
the
church
rests
on
the
foundations
of
some
much
more
ancient
building
probably
a
temple
belonging
to
the
roman
city
behind
the
modern
village
the
hill
terminates
in
a
long
elliptical
mound
about
of
a
mile
in
length
we
made
the
tour
of
it
and
were
surprised
at
finding
a
large
number
of
columns
each
of
a
single
piece
of
marble
they
had
once
formed
a
double
colonnade
extending
from
the
church
to
a
gate
on
the
western
side
of
the
summit
our
native
guide
said
they
had
been
covered
with
an
arch
and
constituted
a
long
market
or
bazaar
a
supposition
in
which
he
may
be
correct
from
the
gate
which
is
still
distinctly
marked
we
overlooked
several
deep
valleys
to
the
west
and
over
them
all
the
blue
horizon
of
the
mediterranean
south
of
cæsarea
on
the
northern
side
of
the
hill
there
are
upwards
of
twenty
more
pillars
standing
besides
a
number
hurled
down
and
the
remains
of
a
quadrangular
colonnade
on
the
side
of
the
hill
below
the
total
number
of
pillars
on
the
summit
can
not
be
less
than
one
hundred
from
twelve
to
eighteen
feet
in
height
the
hill
is
strewn
even
to
its
base
with
large
hewn
blocks
and
fragments
of
sculptured
stone
the
present
name
of
the
city
was
given
to
it
by
herod
and
it
must
have
been
at
that
time
a
most
stately
and
beautiful
place
we
descended
to
a
valley
on
the
east
climbed
a
long
ascent
and
after
crossing
the
broad
shoulder
of
a
mountain
beyond
saw
below
us
a
landscape
even
more
magnificent
than
that
of
nablous
it
was
a
great
winding
valley
its
bottom
rolling
in
waves
of
wheat
and
barley
while
every
up
to
the
bare
rock
was
mantled
with
groves
of
olive
the
very
summits
which
looked
into
this
garden
of
israel
were
green
with
fragrant
plants
wild
thyme
and
sage
gnaphalium
and
camomile
away
to
the
west
was
the
sea
and
in
the
the
mountain
chain
of
carmel
we
went
down
to
the
gardens
and
and
stopped
to
rest
at
the
village
of
geba
which
hangs
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
a
spring
of
whitish
but
delicious
water
gushed
out
of
the
soil
in
the
midst
of
a
fig
orchard
the
women
passed
us
going
back
and
forth
with
tall
on
their
heads
some
brought
down
a
flock
of
black
goats
and
they
were
all
given
drink
in
a
large
wooden
bowl
they
were
beautiful
animals
with
thick
curved
horns
white
eyes
and
ears
a
foot
long
it
was
a
truly
biblical
picture
in
every
feature
beyond
this
valley
we
passed
a
circular
basin
which
has
no
outlet
so
that
in
winter
the
bottom
of
it
must
be
a
lake
after
winding
among
the
hills
an
hour
more
we
came
out
upon
the
town
of
jenin
a
turkish
village
with
a
tall
white
minaret
at
the
head
of
the
great
plain
of
esdraelon
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
ancient
jezreel
where
the
termagant
jezebel
was
thrown
out
of
the
window
we
pitched
our
tent
in
a
garden
near
the
town
under
a
beautiful
mulberry
tree
and
as
the
place
is
in
very
bad
repute
engaged
a
man
to
keep
guard
at
night
an
english
family
was
robbed
there
two
or
three
weeks
ago
our
guard
did
his
duty
well
pacing
back
and
forth
and
occasionally
grounding
his
musket
to
keep
up
his
courage
by
the
sound
in
the
evening
françois
caught
a
chameleon
a
little
creature
which
changed
color
in
a
marvellous
manner
our
road
next
day
lay
directly
across
the
plain
of
esdraelon
one
of
the
richest
districts
in
the
world
it
is
now
a
green
sea
covered
with
fields
of
wheat
and
barley
or
great
grazing
tracts
on
which
multitudes
of
sheep
and
goats
are
wandering
in
some
respects
it
reminded
me
of
the
valley
of
san
josé
and
if
i
were
to
liken
palestine
to
any
other
country
i
have
seen
it
would
be
california
the
climate
and
succession
of
the
seasons
are
the
same
the
soil
is
very
similar
in
quality
and
the
landscapes
present
the
same
general
features
here
in
spring
the
plains
are
covered
with
that
deluge
of
floral
bloom
which
makes
california
seem
a
paradise
here
there
are
the
same
picturesque
groves
the
same
rank
fields
of
wild
oats
clothing
the
the
same
aromatic
herbs
impregnating
the
air
with
balm
and
above
all
the
same
blue
cloudless
days
and
dewless
nights
while
travelling
here
i
am
constantly
reminded
of
our
new
syria
on
the
pacific
towards
noon
mount
tabor
separated
itself
from
the
chain
of
hills
before
us
and
stood
out
singly
at
the
extremity
of
the
plain
we
watered
our
horses
at
a
spring
in
a
swamp
were
some
women
were
collected
beating
with
sticks
the
rushes
they
had
gathered
to
make
mats
after
reaching
the
mountains
on
the
northern
side
of
the
plain
an
ascent
of
an
hour
and
through
a
narrow
glen
brought
us
to
nazareth
which
is
situated
in
a
under
the
highest
peaks
of
the
range
as
we
were
passing
a
rocky
part
of
the
road
harrison
horse
fell
with
him
and
severely
injured
his
leg
we
were
fortunately
near
our
destination
and
on
reaching
the
latin
convent
fra
joachim
to
whose
surgical
abilities
the
traveller
book
bore
witness
took
him
in
charge
many
others
besides
ourselves
have
had
reason
to
be
thankful
for
the
good
offices
of
the
latin
monks
in
palestine
i
have
never
met
with
a
class
more
kind
cordial
and
genial
all
the
convents
are
bound
to
take
in
and
entertain
all
applicants
of
whatever
creed
or
nation
for
the
space
of
three
days
in
the
afternoon
fra
joachim
accompanied
me
to
the
church
of
the
virgin
which
is
inclosed
within
the
walls
of
the
convent
it
is
built
over
the
supposed
site
of
the
house
in
which
the
mother
of
christ
was
living
at
the
time
of
the
angelic
annunciation
under
the
high
altar
a
flight
of
steps
leads
down
to
the
shrine
of
the
virgin
on
the
threshold
of
the
house
where
the
angel
gabriel
foot
rested
as
he
stood
with
a
lily
in
his
hand
announcing
the
miraculous
conception
the
shrine
of
white
marble
and
gold
gleaming
in
the
light
of
golden
lamps
stands
under
a
rough
arch
of
the
natural
rock
from
the
side
of
which
hangs
a
heavy
fragment
of
a
granite
pillar
suspended
as
the
devout
believe
by
divine
power
fra
joachim
informed
me
that
when
the
moslems
attempted
to
obliterate
all
tokens
of
the
holy
place
this
pillar
was
preserved
by
a
miracle
that
the
locality
might
not
be
lost
to
the
christians
at
the
same
time
he
said
the
angels
of
god
carried
away
the
wooden
house
which
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
grotto
and
after
letting
it
drop
in
marseilles
while
they
rested
picked
it
up
again
and
set
it
down
in
loretto
where
it
still
remains
as
he
said
this
there
was
such
entire
absolute
belief
in
the
good
monk
eyes
and
such
happiness
in
that
belief
that
not
for
ten
times
the
gold
on
the
shrine
would
i
have
expressed
a
doubt
of
the
story
he
then
bade
me
kneel
that
i
might
see
the
spot
where
the
angel
stood
and
devoutly
repeated
a
paternoster
while
i
contemplated
the
pure
plate
of
snowy
marble
surrounded
with
vases
of
fragrant
flowers
between
which
hung
cressets
of
gold
wherein
perfumed
oils
were
burning
all
the
decorations
of
the
place
conveyed
the
idea
of
transcendent
purity
and
sweetness
and
for
the
first
time
in
palestine
i
wished
for
perfect
faith
in
the
spot
behind
the
shrine
there
are
two
or
three
chambers
in
the
rock
which
served
as
habitations
for
the
family
of
the
virgin
a
young
christian
nazarene
afterwards
conducted
me
to
the
house
of
joseph
the
carpenter
which
is
now
inclosed
in
a
little
chapel
it
is
merely
a
fragment
of
wall
undoubtedly
as
old
as
the
time
of
christ
and
i
felt
willing
to
consider
it
a
genuine
relic
there
was
an
honest
roughness
about
the
large
stones
inclosing
a
small
room
called
the
shop
which
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
doubt
besides
in
a
quiet
country
town
like
nazareth
which
has
never
knows
such
vicissitudes
as
jerusalem
much
more
dependence
can
be
placed
on
popular
tradition
for
the
same
reason
i
looked
with
reverence
on
the
table
of
christ
also
inclosed
within
a
chapel
this
is
a
large
natural
rock
about
nine
feet
by
twelve
nearly
square
and
quite
flat
on
the
top
it
is
said
that
it
once
served
as
a
table
for
christ
and
his
disciples
the
building
called
the
school
of
christ
where
he
went
with
other
children
of
his
age
is
now
a
church
of
the
syrian
christians
who
were
performing
a
doleful
mass
in
arabic
at
the
time
of
my
visit
it
is
a
vaulted
apartment
about
forty
feet
long
and
only
the
lower
part
of
the
wall
is
ancient
at
each
of
these
places
the
nazarene
put
into
my
hand
a
piece
of
pasteboard
on
which
was
printed
a
prayer
in
latin
italian
and
arabic
with
the
information
that
whoever
visited
the
place
and
made
the
prayer
would
be
entitled
to
seven
years
indulgence
i
duly
read
all
the
prayers
and
accordingly
my
conscience
ought
to
be
at
rest
for
years

my

had
done
so
well
under
the
care
of
fra
joachim
that
he
was
able
to
ride
and
our
journey
was
not
delayed
by
his
accident
the
benedictions
of
the
good
franciscans
accompanied
us
as
we
rode
away
from
the
convent
past
the
fountain
of
the
virgin
and
out
of
the
pleasant
little
valley
where
the
boy
jesus
wandered
for
many
peaceful
years
the
christian
guide
we
engaged
for
mount
tabor
had
gone
ahead
and
we
did
not
find
him
until
we
had
travelled
for
more
than
two
hours
among
the
hills
as
we
approached
the
sacred
mountain
we
came
upon
the
region
of
oaks
the
first
oak
i
had
seen
since
leaving
europe
last
autumn
there
are
three
or
four
varieties
some
with
evergreen
foliage
and
in
their
wild
luxuriance
and
the
picturesqueness
of
their
forms
and
groupings
they
resemble
those
of
california
the
sea
of
grass
and
flowers
in
which
they
stood
was
sprinkled
with
thick
tufts
of
wild
oats
another
point
of
resemblance
to
the
latter
country
but
here
there
is
no
gold
there
no
sacred
memories
the
guide
was
waiting
for
us
beside
a
spring
among
the
trees
he
was
a
tall
youth
of
about
twenty
with
a
mild
submissive
face
and
wore
the
turban
which
appears
to
be
the
badge
of
a
native
syrian
christian
i
found
myself
involuntarily
pitying
him
for
belonging
to
a
despised
sect
there
is
no
disguising
the
fact
that
one
feels
much
more
respect
for
the
mussulman
rulers
of
the
east
than
for
their
oppressed
subjects
who
profess
his
own
faith
the
surest
way
to
make
a
man
contemptible
is
to
treat
him
contemptuously
and
the
oriental
christians
who
have
been
despised
for
centuries
are
with
some
few
exceptions
despicable
enough
now
however
since
the
east
has
become
a
favorite
field
of
travel
and
the
frank
possesses
an
equal
dignity
with
the
moslem
the
native
christians
are
beginning
to
hold
up
their
heads
and
the
return
of
will
in
the
course
of
time
make
them
respectable
mount
tabor
stands
a
little
in
advance
of
the
with
which
it
is
connected
only
by
a
low
spur
or
shoulder
its
base
being
the
plain
of
esdraelon
this
is
probably
the
reason
why
it
has
been
fixed
upon
as
the
place
of
the
transfiguration
as
it
is
not
mentioned
by
name
in
the
new
testament
the
words
are
an
high
mountain
apart
which
some
suppose
to
refer
to
the
position
of
the
mountain
and
not
to
the
remoteness
of
christ
and
the
three
disciples
from
men
the
sides
of
the
mountain
are
covered
with
clumps
of
oak
hawthorn
and
other
trees
in
many
places
overrun
with
the
white
honeysuckle
its
fingers
dropping
with
odor
of
nutmeg
and
cloves
the
ascent
by
a
steep
and
winding
path
occupied
an
hour
the
summit
is
nearly
level
and
resembles
some
overgrown
american
field
or
oak
opening
the
grass
is
more
than
the
trees
grow
high
and
strong
and
there
are
tangled
thickets
and
bowers
of
vines
without
end
the
eastern
and
highest
end
of
the
mountain
is
covered
with
the
remains
of
an
old
once
a
place
of
great
strength
from
the
thickness
of
its
walls
in
a
sort
of
cell
formed
among
the
ruins
we
found
two
i
addressed
them
in
all
languages
of
which
i
know
a
salutation
without
effect
but
at
last
made
out
that
they
were
wallachians
they
were
men
of
with
stupid
faces
dirty
garments
beards
run
to
waste
and
fur
caps
their
cell
was
a
mere
hovel
without
furniture
except
a
horrid
caricature
of
the
virgin
and
child
and
four
books
of
prayers
in
the
bulgarian
character
one
of
them
walked
about
knitting
a
stocking
and
paid
no
attention
to
us
but
the
other
after
giving
us
some
deliciously
cold
water
got
upon
a
pile
of
rubbish
and
stood
regarding
us
with
open
mouth
while
we
took
breakfast
so
far
from
this
being
a
cause
of
annoyance
i
felt
really
glad
that
our
presence
had
agitated
the
stagnant
waters
of
his
mind
the
day
was
hazy
and
sultry
but
the
panoramic
view
from
mount
tabor
was
still
very
fine
the
great
plain
of
esdraelon
lay
below
us
like
a
vast
mosaic
of
green
and
brown
jasper
and
on
the
west
mount
carmel
lifted
his
head
above
the
blue
horizon
line
of
the
mediterranean
turning
to
the
other
side
a
strip
of
the
sea
of
galilee
glimmered
deep
down
among
the
hills
and
the
ghor
or
the
valley
of
the
jordan
stretched
like
a
broad
gash
through
them
beyond
them
the
country
of
djebel
adjeloun
the
ancient
decapolis
which
still
holds
the
walls
of
gadara
and
the
temples
and
theatres
of
djerash
faded
away
into
vapor
and
still
further
to
the
south
the
desolate
hills
of
gilead
the
home
of
jephthah
mount
hermon
is
visible
when
the
atmosphere
is
clear
but
we
were
not
able
to
see
it
from
the
top
of
mount
tabor
to
tiberias
on
the
sea
of
galilee
is
a
journey
of
five
hours
through
a
wild
country
with
but
one
single
miserable
village
on
the
road
at
first
we
rode
through
lonely
dells
grown
with
oak
and
brilliant
with
flowers
especially
the
large
purple
mallow
and
then
over
broad
treeless
tracts
of
rolling
land
but
partially
cultivated
the
heat
was
very
great
i
had
no
thermometer
but
should
judge
the
temperature
to
have
been
at
least
in
the
shade
from
the
edge
of
the
upland
tract
we
looked
down
on
the
sea
of
galilee
a
beautiful
sheet
of
water
sunk
among
the
mountains
and
more
than
feet
below
the
level
of
the
mediterranean
it
lay
unruffled
in
the
bottom
of
the
basin
reflecting
the
peaks
of
the
bare
red
mountains
beyond
it
tiberias
was
at
our
very
feet
a
few
palm
trees
alone
relieving
the
nakedness
of
its
dull
walls
after
taking
a
welcome
drink
at
the
fountain
of
we
descended
to
the
town
which
has
a
desolate
and
forlorn
air
its
walls
have
been
partly
thrown
down
by
earthquakes
and
never
repaired
we
found
our
tents
already
pitched
on
the
bank
above
the
lake
and
under
one
of
the
tottering
towers
not
a
breath
of
air
was
stirring
the
red
hills
smouldered
in
the
heat
and
the
waters
of
genesareth
at
our
feet
glimmered
with
an
oily
smoothness
unbroken
by
a
ripple
we
untwisted
our
turbans
kicked
off
our
baggy
trowsers
and
speedily
releasing
ourselves
from
the
barbarous
restraints
of
dress
dipped
into
the
tepid
sea
and
floated
lazily
out
until
we
could
feel
the
exquisite
coldness
of
the
living
springs
which
sent
up
their
jets
from
the
bottom
i
was
lying
on
my
back
moving
my
fins
just
sufficiently
to
keep
afloat
and
gazing
dreamily
through
eyes
on
the
forlorn
palms
of
tiberias
when
a
shrill
voice
hailed
me
with
o
howadji
get
out
of
our
way
there
at
the
old
stone
gateway
below
our
tent
stood
two
galilean
damsels
with
heavy
earthen
jars
upon
their
heads
go
away
yourselves
o
maidens
i
answered
if
you
want
us
to
come
out
of
the
water
but
we
must
fill
our
pitchers
one
of
them
replied
then
fill
them
at
once
and
be
not
afraid
or
leave
them
and
we
will
fill
them
for
you
thereupon
they
put
the
pitchers
down
but
remained
watching
us
very
complacently
while
we
sank
the
vessels
to
the
bottom
of
the
lake
and
let
them
fill
from
the
colder
and
purer
tide
of
the
springs
in
bringing
them
back
through
the
water
to
the
gate
the
one
i
propelled
before
me
happened
to
strike
against
a
stone
and
its
fair
owner
on
receiving
it
immediately
pointed
to
a
crack
in
the
side
which
she
declared
i
had
made
and
went
off
lamenting
after
we
had
resumed
our
garments
and
were
enjoying
the
pipe
of
indolence
and
the
coffee
of
contentment
she
returned
and
made
such
an
outcry
that
i
was
fain
to
purchase
peace
by
the
price
of
a
new
pitcher
i
passed
the
first
hours
night
in
looking
out
of
my
as
i
lay
on
the
stars
sparkling
in
the
bosom
of
galilee
like
the
sheen
of
assyrian
spears
and
the
glare
of
the
great
fires
kindled
on
the
opposite
shore
the
next
day
we
travelled
northward
along
the
lake
passing
through
continuous
thickets
of
oleander
fragrant
with
its
heavy
pink
blossoms
the
thistles
were
more
abundant
and
beautiful
than
ever
i
noticed
in
particular
one
with
a
superb
globular
flower
of
a
bright
blue
color
which
would
make
a
choice
ornament
for
our
gardens
at
home
at
the
head
of
the
lake
the
mountains
fall
back
and
leave
a
large
tract
of
the
richest
which
narrows
away
into
a
deep
dell
overhung
by
high
mountain
headlands
faced
with
naked
cliffs
of
red
rock
the
features
of
the
landscape
are
magnificent
up
the
dell
i
saw
plainly
the
mount
of
beatitude
beyond
which
lies
the
village
of
cana
of
galilee
in
coming
up
the
meadow
we
passed
a
miserable
little
village
of
thatched
mud
huts
almost
hidden
by
the
rank
weeds
which
grew
around
them
a
withered
old
crone
sat
at
one
of
the
doors
sunning
herself
what
is
the
name
of
this
village
i
asked
it
is
mejdel
was
her
reply
this
was
the
ancient
magdala
the
home
of
that
beautiful
but
sinful
magdalene
whose
repentance
has
made
her
one
of
the
brightest
of
the
saints
the
crystal
waters
of
the
lake
here
lave
a
shore
of
the
cleanest
pebbles
the
path
goes
winding
through
oleanders
nebbuks
patches
of
hollyhock
fennel
and
other
spicy
plants
while
on
the
west
great
fields
of
barley
stand
ripe
for
the
cutting
in
some
places
the
fellahs
men
and
women
were
at
work
reaping
and
binding
the
sheaves
after
crossing
this
tract
we
came
to
the
hill
at
the
foot
of
which
was
a
ruined
khan
and
on
the
summit
other
undistinguishable
ruins
supposed
by
some
to
be
those
of
capernaum
the
site
of
that
exalted
town
however
is
still
a
matter
of
discussion
we
journeyed
on
in
a
most
sweltering
atmosphere
over
the
ascending
hills
the
valley
of
the
upper
jordan
lying
deep
on
our
right
in
a
shallow
hollow
under
one
of
the
highest
peaks
there
stands
a
large
deserted
khan
over
a
well
of
very
cold
sweet
water
called
by
the
arabs
somewhere
near
it
according
to
tradition
is
the
field
where
joseph
was
sold
by
his
brethren
and
the
well
is
no
doubt
looked
upon
by
many
as
the
identical
pit
into
which
he
was
thrown
a
stately
turk
of
damascus
with
four
servants
behind
him
came
riding
up
as
we
were
resting
in
the
gateway
of
the
khan
and
in
answer
to
my
question
informed
me
that
the
well
was
so
named
from
nebbee
youssuf
the
prophet
joseph
and
not
from
sultan
joseph
saladin
he
took
us
for
his
countrymen
accosting
me
first
in
turkish
and
even
after
i
had
talked
with
him
some
time
in
bad
arabic
asked
me
whether
i
had
been
making
a
pilgrimage
to
the
tombs
of
certain
holy
moslem
saints
in
the
neighborhood
of
jaffa
he
joined
company
with
us
however
and
shared
his
pipe
with
me
as
we
continued
our
journey
we
rode
for
two
hours
more
over
hills
bare
of
trees
but
covered
thick
with
grass
and
herbs
and
finally
lost
our
way
françois
went
ahead
dashing
through
the
fields
of
barley
and
lentils
and
we
reached
the
path
again
as
the
waters
of
merom
came
in
sight
we
then
descended
into
the
valley
of
the
upper
jordan
and
encamped
opposite
the
lake
at
ain
the
fountain
of
the
the
first
source
of
the
sacred
river
a
stream
of
water
sufficient
to
turn
mills
gushes
and
gurgles
up
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
there
are
the
remains
of
an
ancient
dam
by
which
a
large
pool
was
formed
for
the
irrigation
of
the
valley
it
still
supplies
a
little
arab
mill
below
the
fountain
this
is
a
frontier
post
between
the
jurisdictions
of
the
pashas
of
jerusalem
and
damascus
and
the
of
the
greek
caloyer
who
left
us
at
tiberias
was
obliged
to
pay
a
duty
of
seven
and
a
half
piastres
on
fifteen
mats
which
he
had
bought
at
jerusalem
for
one
and
a
half
piastres
each
the
poor
man
will
perhaps
make
a
dozen
piastres
about
half
a
dollar
on
these
mats
at
damascus
after
carrying
them
on
his
mule
for
more
than
two
hundred
miles
we
pitched
our
tents
on
the
grassy
meadow
below
the
mill
a
charming
spot
with
tell
the
hill
of
wild
boars
just
in
front
over
the
waters
of
merom
and
the
summit
of
djebel
the
great
mount
hermon
towering
high
above
the
valley
this
is
the
loftiest
peak
of
the
and
is
feet
above
the
sea
the
next
morning
we
rode
for
three
hours
before
reaching
the
second
spring
of
the
jordan
at
a
place
which
françois
called
tell
but
which
did
not
at
all
answer
with
the
description
given
me
by
robinson
at
jerusalem
the
upper
part
of
the
broad
valley
whence
the
jordan
draws
his
waters
is
flat
moist
and
but
little
cultivated
there
are
immense
herds
of
sheep
goats
and
buffaloes
wandering
over
it
the
people
are
a
dark
arab
tribe
and
live
in
tents
and
miserable
clay
huts
where
the
valley
begins
to
slope
upward
towards
the
hills
they
plant
wheat
barley
and
lentils
the
soil
is
the
fattest
brown
loam
and
the
harvests
are
wonderfully
rich
i
saw
many
tracts
of
wheat
from
half
a
mile
to
a
mile
in
extent
which
would
average
forty
bushels
to
the
acre
yet
the
ground
is
never
manured
and
the
arab
plough
scratches
up
but
a
few
inches
of
the
surface
what
a
paradise
might
be
made
of
this
country
were
it
in
better
hands
the
second
spring
is
not
quite
so
large
as
ain
but
like
it
pours
out
a
strong
stream
from
a
single
source
the
pool
was
filled
with
women
washing
the
heavy
fleeces
of
their
sheep
and
beating
the
dirt
out
of
their
striped
camel
hair
abas
with
long
poles
we
left
it
and
entered
on
a
slope
of
stony
ground
forming
the
head
of
the
valley
the
view
extended
southward
to
the
mountains
closing
the
northern
cove
of
the
sea
of
galilee
it
was
a
grand
rich
landscape
so
rich
that
its
desolation
seems
forced
and
unnatural
high
on
the
summit
of
a
mountain
to
the
west
the
ruins
of
a
large
crusader
fortress
looked
down
upon
us
the
soil
which
slowly
climbs
upward
through
a
long
valley
between
lebanon
and
is
cut
with
deep
ravines
the
path
is
very
difficult
to
find
and
while
we
were
riding
forward
at
random
looking
in
all
directions
for
our
baggage
mules
we
started
up
a
beautiful
gazelle
at
last
about
noon
hot
hungry
and
thirsty
we
reached
a
swift
stream
roaring
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
ravine
through
a
bed
of
gorgeous
foliage
the
odor
of
the
wild
which
came
up
to
us
as
we
rode
along
the
edge
was
overpowering
in
its
sweetness
an
old
bridge
of
two
arches
crossed
the
stream
there
was
a
pile
of
rocks
against
the
central
pier
and
there
we
sat
and
took
breakfast
in
the
shade
of
the
maples
while
the
cold
green
waters
foamed
at
our
feet
by
all
the
naiads
and
tritons
what
a
joy
there
is
in
beholding
a
running
stream
the
rivers
of
lebanon
are
miracles
to
me
after
my
knowledge
of
the
desert
a
company
of
arabs
seven
in
all
were
gathered
under
the
bridge
and
from
a
flute
which
one
of
them
blew
i
judged
they
were
taking
a
pastoral
holiday
we
kept
our
pistols
beside
us
for
we
did
not
like
their
looks
before
leaving
they
told
us
that
the
country
was
full
of
robbers
and
advised
us
to
be
on
the
lookout
we
rode
more
carefully
after
this
and
kept
with
our
baggage
on
reaching
it
an
hour
after
leaving
the
bridge
we
came
to
a
large
circular
or
rather
annular
mound
overgrown
with
grass
and
clumps
of
a
large
stream
of
a
bright
blue
color
gushed
down
the
north
side
and
after
half
embracing
the
mound
swept
off
across
the
meadows
to
the
waters
of
merom
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
this
was
tell
the
site
of
dan
the
most
northern
town
of
ancient
israel
the
mound
on
which
it
was
built
is
the
crater
of
an
extinct
volcano
the
hebrew
word
signifies
judge
and
tell
in
arabic
is
the
hill
of
the
judge
the
now
rose
near
us
its
northern
and
western
slopes
green
with
trees
and
grass
the
first
range
perhaps
feet
in
height
shut
out
the
snowy
head
of
hermon
but
still
the
view
was
sublime
in
its
large
and
harmonious
outlines
our
road
was
through
a
country
resembling
arcadia
the
earth
hidden
by
a
dense
bed
of
grass
and
flowers
thickets
of
blossoming
shrubs
old
old
oaks
with
the
most
gnarled
of
trunks
the
most
picturesque
of
boughs
and
the
glossiest
of
green
leaves
of
amazing
antiquity
and
threading
and
enlivening
all
the
floods
of
lebanon
this
was
the
true
haunt
of
pan
whose
altars
are
now
before
me
graven
on
the
marble
crags
of
hermon
looking
on
those
altars
and
on
the
landscape
lovely
as
a
grecian
dream
i
forget
that
the
lament
has
long
been
sung
pan
pan
is
dead
in
another
hour
we
reached
this
place
the
ancient
cæsarea
philippi
now
a
poor
village
embowered
in
magnificent
trees
and
washed
by
glorious
waters
there
are
abundant
remains
of
the
old
city
fragments
of
immense
walls
broken
granite
columns
traces
of
pavements
great
blocks
of
hewn
stone
marble
pedestals
and
the
like
in
the
rock
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
there
are
several
elegant
niches
with
greek
inscriptions
besides
a
large
natural
grotto
below
them
the
water
gushes
up
through
the
stones
in
a
hundred
streams
forming
a
flood
of
considerable
size
we
have
made
our
camp
in
an
olive
grove
near
the
end
of
the
village
beside
an
immense
terebinth
tree
which
is
inclosed
in
an
open
court
paved
with
stone
this
is
the
of
banias
where
the
shekh
dispenses
justice
and
at
the
same
time
the
resort
of
all
the
idlers
of
the
place
we
went
up
among
them
soon
after
our
arrival
and
were
given
seats
of
honor
near
the
shekh
who
talked
with
me
a
long
time
about
america
the
people
exhibit
a
very
sensible
curiosity
desiring
to
know
the
extent
of
our
country
the
number
of
inhabitants
the
amount
of
taxation
the
price
of
grain
and
other
solid
information
the
shekh
and
the
men
of
the
place
inform
us
that
the
druses
are
infesting
the
road
to
damascus
this
tribe
is
in
rebellion
in
djebel
hauaran
on
account
of
the
conscription
and
some
of
them
it
appears
have
taken
refuge
in
the
fastnesses
of
hermon
where
they
are
beginning
to
plunder
travellers
while
i
was
talking
with
the
shekh
a
druse
came
down
from
the
mountains
and
sat
for
half
an
hour
among
the
villagers
under
the
terebinth
and
we
have
just
heard
that
he
has
gone
back
the
way
he
came
this
fact
has
given
us
some
anxiety
as
he
may
have
been
a
spy
sent
down
to
gather
news
and
if
so
we
are
almost
certain
to
be
waylaid
if
we
were
well
armed
we
should
not
fear
a
dozen
but
all
our
weapons
consist
of
a
sword
and
four
pistols
after
consulting
together
we
decided
to
apply
to
the
shekh
for
two
armed
men
to
accompany
us
i
accordingly
went
to
him
again
and
exhibited
the
firman
of
the
pasha
of
jerusalem
which
he
read
stating
that
even
without
it
he
would
have
felt
it
his
duty
to
grant
our
request
this
is
the
graceful
way
in
which
the
orientals
submit
to
a
peremptory
order
he
thinks
that
one
man
will
be
sufficient
as
we
shall
probably
not
meet
with
any
large
party
the
day
has
been
and
still
is
excessively
hot
the
atmosphere
is
sweltering
and
all
around
us
over
the
thick
patches
of
mallow
and
wild
mustard
the
bees
are
humming
with
a
continuous
sultry
sound
the
shekh
with
a
number
of
lazy
villagers
is
still
seated
under
the
terebinth
in
a
tent
of
shade
impervious
to
the
sun
i
can
hear
the
rush
of
the
fountains
of
banias
the
holy
springs
of
hermon
whence
jordan
is
born
but
what
is
this
the
odor
of
the
velvety
weed
of
shiraz
meets
my
nostrils
a
son
of
pan
places
the
narghileh
at
my
feet
and
bubbling
more
sweetly
than
the
streams
of
jordan
the
incense
most
dear
to
the
god
dims
the
crystal
censer
and
floats
from
my
lips
in
rhythmic
ejaculations
i
too
am
in

the

came
a
arab
without

but
on
our
refusing
to
take
him
thus
he
brought
a
turkish
musket
terrible
to
behold
but
quite
guiltless
of
any
murderous
intent
we
gave
ourselves
up
to
fate
with
true
and
began
ascending
the
up
and
up
by
stony
paths
under
the
oaks
beside
the
streams
and
between
the
we
climbed
for
two
hours
and
at
last
reached
a
comb
or
dividing
ridge
whence
we
could
look
into
a
valley
on
the
other
side
or
rather
inclosed
between
the
main
chain
and
the
offshoot
named
djebel
heish
which
stretches
away
towards
the
about
up
the
ascent
we
passed
the
ruined
acropolis
of
cæsarea
philippi
crowning
the
summit
of
a
lower
peak
the
walls
and
bastions
cover
a
great
extent
of
ground
and
were
evidently
used
as
a
stronghold
in
the
middle
ages
the
valley
into
which
we
descended
lay
directly
under
one
of
the
peaks
of
hermon
and
the
rills
that
watered
it
were
fed
from
his
it
was
inhabited
by
druses
but
no
men
were
to
be
seen
except
a
few
poor
husbandmen
ploughing
on
the
the
women
wearing
those
enormous
horns
on
their
heads
which
distinguish
them
from
the
mohammedan
females
were
washing
at
a
pool
below
we
crossed
the
valley
and
slowly
ascended
the
height
on
the
opposite
side
taking
care
to
keep
with
the
up
to
this
time
we
met
very
few
persons
and
we
forgot
the
anticipated
perils
in
contemplating
the
rugged
scenery
of
the
the
were
brilliant
with
flowers
and
many
new
and
beautiful
specimens
arrested
our
attention
the
asphodel
grew
in
bunches
beside
the
streams
and
the
large
scarlet
anemone
outshone
even
the
poppy
whose
color
here
is
the
quintessence
of
flame
five
hours
after
leaving
banias
we
reached
the
highest
part
of
the
pass
a
dreary
volcanic
region
covered
with
fragments
of
lava
just
at
this
place
an
old
arab
met
us
and
after
scanning
us
closely
stopped
and
accosted
dervish
the
latter
immediately
came
running
ahead
quite
excited
with
the
news
that
the
old
man
had
seen
a
company
of
about
fifty
druses
descend
from
the
sides
of
mount
hermon
towards
the
road
we
were
to
travel
we
immediately
ordered
the
baggage
to
halt
and
harrison
françois
and
myself
rode
on
to
reconnoitre
our
guard
the
valiant
man
of
banias
whose
teeth
already
chattered
with
fear
prudently
kept
with
the
baggage
we
crossed
the
ridge
and
watched
the
stony
for
some
time
but
no
spear
or
glittering
could
we
see
the
caravan
was
then
set
in
motion
and
we
had
not
proceeded
far
before
we
met
a
second
company
of
arabs
who
informed
us
that
the
road
was
free
leaving
the
heights
we
descended
cautiously
into
a
ravine
with
walls
of
rough
volcanic
rock
on
each
side
it
was
a
pass
where
three
men
might
have
stood
their
ground
against
a
hundred
and
we
did
not
feel
thoroughly
convinced
of
our
safety
till
we
had
threaded
its
many
windings
and
emerged
upon
a
narrow
valley
a
village
called
beit
jenn
nestled
under
the
rocks
and
below
it
a
grove
of
shaded
the
banks
of
a
rapid
stream
we
had
now
fairly
crossed
the
the
dazzling
snows
of
mount
hermon
overhung
us
on
the
west
and
from
the
opening
of
the
valley
we
looked
across
a
wild
waste
country
to
the
distant
range
of
djebel
hauaran
the
seat
of
the
present
rebellion
and
one
of
the
most
interesting
regions
of
syria
i
regretted
more
than
ever
not
being
able
to
reach
it
the
ruins
of
bozrah
ezra
and
other
ancient
cities
would
well
repay
the
arduous
character
of
the
journey
while
the
traveller
might
succeed
in
getting
some
insight
into
the
life
and
habits
of
that
singular
people
the
druses
but
now
and
perhaps
for
some
time
to
come
there
is
no
chance
of
entering
the
hauaran
towards
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
reached
a
large
village
which
is
usually
the
end
of
the
first
day
journey
from
banias
our
men
wanted
to
stop
here
but
we
considered
that
to
halt
then
would
be
to
increase
the
risk
and
decided
to
push
on
to
katana
four
hours
journey
from
damascus
they
yielded
with
a
bad
grace
and
we
jogged
on
over
the
stony
road
crossing
the
long
hills
which
form
the
eastern
base
of
the
before
long
another
arab
met
us
with
the
news
that
there
was
an
encampment
of
druses
on
the
plain
between
us
and
katana
at
this
our
guard
who
had
recovered
sufficient
spirit
to
ride
a
few
paces
in
advance
fell
back
and
the
impassive
dervish
became
greatly
agitated
where
there
is
an
uncertain
danger
it
is
always
better
to
go
ahead
than
to
turn
back
and
we
did
so
but
the
guard
reined
up
on
the
top
of
the
first
ridge
trembling
as
he
pointed
to
a
distant
hill
and
cried
out
ahò
ahò
henàk
there
they
are
there
were
in
fact
the
shadows
of
some
rocks
which
bore
a
faint
resemblance
to
tents
before
sunset
we
reached
the
last
declivity
of
the
mountains
and
saw
far
in
the
dusky
plain
the
long
green
belt
of
the
gardens
of
damascus
and
here
and
there
the
indistinct
glimmer
of
a
minaret
katana
our
for
the
night
lay
below
us
buried
in
orchards
of
olive
and
orange
we
pitched
our
tents
on
the
banks
of
a
beautiful
stream
enjoyed
the
pipe
of
tranquillity
after
our
long
march
and
soon
forgot
the
druses
in
a
slumber
that
lasted
unbroken
till
dawn
in
the
morning
we
sent
back
the
man
of
banias
left
the
baggage
to
take
care
of
itself
and
rode
on
to
damascus
as
fast
as
our
tired
horses
could
carry
us
the
plain
at
first
barren
and
stony
became
enlivened
with
vineyards
and
fields
of
wheat
as
we
advanced
arabs
were
everywhere
at
work
ploughing
and
directing
the
the
belt
of
living
green
the
bower
in
which
the
great
city
the
queen
of
the
orient
hides
her
beauty
drew
nearer
and
nearer
stretching
out
a
crescent
of
foliage
for
miles
on
either
hand
that
gradually
narrowed
and
received
us
into
its
cool
and
fragrant
heart
we
sank
into
a
sea
of
olive
pomegranate
orange
plum
apricot
walnut
and
plane
trees
and
were
lost
the
sun
sparkled
in
the
rolling
surface
above
but
we
swam
through
the
green
depths
below
his
reach
and
thus
drifted
on
through
miles
of
shade
entered
the
city
since
our
arrival
i
find
that
two
other
parties
of
travellers
one
of
which
crossed
the
on
the
northern
side
of
mount
hermon
were
obliged
to
take
guards
and
saw
several
druse
spies
posted
on
the
heights
as
they
passed
a
russian
gentleman
travelling
from
here
to
tiberias
was
stopped
three
times
on
the
road
and
only
escaped
being
plundered
from
the
fact
of
his
having
a
druse
dragoman
the
disturbances
are
more
serious
than
i
had
anticipated
four
regiments
left
here

sent
to
the
aid
of
a
company
of

is

damascus
is
considered
by
many
travellers
as
the
best
remaining
type
of
an
oriental
city
constantinople

cairo
is
fast
becoming
so
but
damascus
away
from
the
highways
of
commerce
seated
alone
between
the
lebanon
and
the
syrian
desert
still
retains
in
its
outward
aspect
and
in
the
character
of
its
inhabitants
all
the
pride
and
fancy
and
fanaticism
of
the
times
of
the
caliphs
with
this
judgment
in
general
terms
i
agree
but
not
to
its
ascendancy
in
every
respect
over
cairo
true
when
you
behold
damascus
from
the
salahiyeh
the
last
slope
of
the
it
is
the
realization
of
all
that
you
have
dreamed
of
oriental
splendor
the
world
has
no
picture
more
dazzling
it
is
beauty
carried
to
the
sublime
as
i
have
felt
when
overlooking
some
boundless
forest
of
palms
within
the
tropics
from
the
hill
whose
ridges
heave
behind
you
until
in
the
south
they
rise
to
the
snowy
head
of
mount
hermon
the
great
syrian
plain
stretches
away
to
the
euphrates
broken
at
distances
of
ten
and
fifteen
miles
by
two
detached
mountain
chains
in
a
terrible
gorge
at
your
side
the
river
barrada
the
ancient
pharpar
forces
its
way
to
the
plain
and
its
waters
divided
into
twelve
different
channels
make
all
between
you
and
those
blue
of
the
desert
one
great
garden
the
boundaries
of
which
your
vision
can
barely
distinguish
its
longest
diameter
can
not
be
less
than
twenty
miles
you
look
down
on
a
world
of
foliage
and
fruit
and
blossoms
whose
hue
by
contrast
with
the
barren
mountains
and
the
yellow
rim
of
the
desert
which
incloses
it
seems
brighter
than
all
other
gardens
in
the
world
through
its
centre
following
the
course
of
the
river
lies
damascus
a
line
of
white
walls
topped
with
domes
and
towers
and
tall
minarets
winding
away
for
miles
through
the
green
sea
nothing
less
than
a
city
of
palaces
whose
walls
are
marble
and
whose
doors
are
ivory
and
pearl
could
keep
up
the
enchantment
of
that
distant
view
we
rode
for
an
hour
through
the
gardens
before
entering
the
gate
the
of
whatever
variety
olive
apricot
or
fig
were
the
noblest
of
their
kind
roses
and
pomegranates
in
bloom
starred
the
dark
foliage
and
the
scented
jasmine
overhung
the
walls
but
as
we
approached
the
city
the
view
was
obscured
by
high
mud
walls
on
either
side
of
the
road
and
we
only
caught
glimpses
now
and
then
of
the
fragrant
wilderness
the
first
street
we
entered
was
low
and
mean
the
houses
of
clay
following
this
we
came
to
an
uncovered
bazaar
with
rude
shops
on
either
side
protected
by
mats
stretched
in
front
and
supported
by
poles
here
all
sorts
of
common
stuns
and
utensils
were
sold
and
the
street
was
filled
with
crowds
of
fellahs
and
desert
arabs
two
large
sycamores
shaded
it
and
the
seraglio
of
the
pasha
of
damascus
a
plain
building
faced
the
entrance
of
the
main
bazaar
which
branched
off
into
the
city
we
turned
into
this
and
after
passing
through
several
small
bazaars
stocked
with
dried
fruits
pipes
and
groceries
and
all
the
primitive
wares
of
the
east
reached
a
large
passage
covered
with
a
steep
wooden
roof
and
entirely
occupied
by
venders
of
silk
stuffs
out
of
this
we
passed
through
another
devoted
to
saddles
and
bridles
then
another
full
of
spices
and
at
last
reached
the
grand
bazaar
where
all
the
richest
stuffs
of
europe
and
the
east
were
displayed
in
the
shops
we
rode
slowly
along
through
the
cool
twilight
crossed
here
and
there
by
long
pencils
of
white
light
falling
through
apertures
in
the
roof
and
illuminating
the
gay
turbans
and
silk
caftans
of
the
lazy
merchants
but
out
of
this
bazaar
at
intervals
opened
the
grand
gate
of
a
khan
giving
us
a
view
of
its
marble
court
its
fountains
and
the
dark
arches
of
its
storerooms
or
the
door
of
a
mosque
with
its
mosaic
floor
and
pillared
corridor
the
interminable
lines
of
bazaars
with
their
atmospheres
of
spice
and
fruit
and
fragrant
tobacco
the
hushed
tread
of
the
slippered
crowds
the
plash
of
falling
fountains
and
the
bubbling
of
innumerable
narghilehs
the
picturesque
merchants
and
their
customers
no
longer
in
the
big
trowsers
of
egypt
but
the
long
caftans
and
abas
of
syria
the
absence
of
frank
faces
and
dresses
in
all
these
there
was
the
true
spirit
of
the
orient
and
so
far
we
were
charmed
with
damascus
at
the
hotel
in
the
soog
or
frank
quarter
the
illusion
was
not
dissipated
it
had
once
been
the
house
of
some
rich
merchant
the
court
into
which
we
were
ushered
is
paved
with
marble
with
a
great
stone
basin
surrounded
with
vases
of
flowering
plants
in
the
centre
two
large
lemon
trees
shade
the
entrance
and
a
vine
climbing
to
the
top
of
the
house
makes
a
leafy
arbor
over
the
flat
roof
the
walls
of
the
house
are
painted
in
horizontal
bars
of
blue
white
orange
and
white
a
gay
grotesqueness
of
style
which
does
not
offend
the
eye
under
an
eastern
sun
on
the
southern
side
of
the
court
is
the
an
arrangement
for
which
the
houses
of
damascus
are
noted
it
is
a
vaulted
apartment
twenty
feet
high
entirely
open
towards
the
court
except
a
fine
pointed
arch
at
the
top
decorated
with
encaustic
ornaments
of
the
most
brilliant
colors
in
front
a
tesselated
pavement
of
marble
leads
to
the
doors
of
the
chambers
on
each
side
beyond
this
is
a
raised
floor
covered
with
matting
and
along
the
farther
end
a
divan
whose
piled
cushions
are
the
most
tempting
trap
ever
set
to
catch
a
lazy
man
although
not
naturally
indolent
i
find
it
impossible
to
resist
the
fascination
of
this
lounge
leaning
back
against
the
cushions
with
the
inseparable
pipe
in
hand
the
view
of
the
court
the
the
flowers
and
lemon
trees
the
servants
and
dragomen
going
back
and
forth
or
smoking
their
narghilehs
in
the
shade
all
framed
in
the
beautiful
arched
entrance
is
so
perfectly
oriental
so
true
a
tableau
from
the
times
of
good
old
haroun
that
one
is
surprised
to
find
how
many
hours
have
slipped
away
while
he
has
been
silently
enjoying
it
opposite
the
is
a
large
room
paved
with
marble
with
a
handsome
fountain
in
the
centre
it
is
the
finest
in
the
hotel
and
now
occupied
by
lord
dalkeith
and
his
friends
our
own
room
is
on
the
upper
floor
and
is
so
rich
in
decorations
that
i
have
not
yet
finished
the
study
of
them
along
the
side
looking
down
on
the
court
we
have
a
mosaic
floor
of
white
red
black
and
yellow
marble
above
this
is
raised
a
second
floor
carpeted
and
furnished
in
european
style
the
walls
for
a
height
of
ten
feet
are
covered
with
wooden
panelling
painted
with
arabesque
devices
in
the
gayest
colors
and
along
the
top
there
is
a
series
of
arabic
inscriptions
in
gold
there
are
a
number
of
niches
or
open
closets
in
the
walls
whose
arched
tops
are
adorned
with
pendent
wooden
ornaments
resembling
stalactites
and
at
the
corners
of
the
room
the
heavy
gilded
and
painted
cornice
drops
into
similar
grotesque
incrustations
a
space
of
bare
white
wall
intervenes
between
this
cornice
and
the
ceiling
which
is
formed
of
slim
poplar
logs
laid
side
by
side
and
so
covered
with
paint
and
with
scales
and
stripes
and
network
devices
in
gold
and
silver
that
one
would
take
them
to
be
clothed
with
the
skins
of
the
magic
serpents
that
guard
the
valley
of
diamonds
my
most
satisfactory
remembrance
of
damascus
will
be
this
room
my
walks
through
the
city
have
been
almost
wholly
confined
to
the
bazaars
which
are
of
immense
extent
one
can
walk
for
many
miles
without
going
beyond
the
cover
of
their
peaked
wooden
roofs
and
in
all
this
round
will
find
no
two
precisely
alike
one
is
devoted
entirely
to
soap
another
to
tobacco
through
which
you
cough
and
sneeze
your
way
to
the
bazaar
of
spices
and
delightedly
inhale
its
perfumed
air
then
there
is
the
bazaar
of
sweetmeats
of
vegetables
of
red
slippers
of
shawls
of
caftans
of
bakers
and
ovens
of
wooden
ware
of
jewelry
great
stone
building
covered
with
vaulted
passages
of
aleppo
silks
of
baghdad
carpets
of
indian
stuffs
of
coffee
and
so
on
through
a
seemingly
endless
variety
as
i
have
already
remarked
along
the
line
of
the
bazaars
are
many
khans
the
resort
of
merchants
from
all
parts
of
turkey
and
persia
and
even
india
they
are
large
stately
buildings
and
some
of
them
have
superb
gateways
of
sculptured
marble
the
interior
courts
are
paved
with
stone
with
fountains
in
the
centre
and
many
of
them
are
covered
with
domes
resting
on
massive
pillars
the
largest
has
a
roof
of
nine
domes
supported
by
four
grand
pillars
which
inclose
a
fountain
the
mosques
into
which
no
christian
is
allowed
to
enter
are
in
general
inferior
to
those
of
cairo
but
their
outer
courts
are
always
paved
with
marble
adorned
with
fountains
and
surrounded
by
light
and
elegant
corridors
the
grand
mosque
is
an
imposing
edifice
and
is
said
to
occupy
the
site
of
a
former
christian
church
another
pleasant
feature
of
the
city
is
its
coffee
shops
which
abound
in
the
bazaars
and
on
the
outskirts
of
the
gardens
beside
the
running
streams
those
in
the
bazaars
are
spacious
rooms
with
vaulted
ceilings
divans
running
around
the
four
walls
and
fountains
in
the
centre
during
the
afternoon
they
are
nearly
always
filled
with
turks
armenians
and
persians
smoking
the
narghileh
or
which
is
the
universal
custom
in
damascus
the
persian
tobacco
brought
here
by
the
caravans
from
baghdad
is
renowned
for
this
kind
of
smoking
the
most
popular
is
near
the
citadel
on
the
banks
and
over
the
surface
of
the
pharpar
it
is
a
rough
wooden
building
with
a
roof
of
straw
mats
but
the
sight
and
sound
of
the
rushing
waters
as
they
shoot
away
with
arrowy
swiftness
under
your
feet
the
shade
of
the
trees
that
line
the
banks
and
the
cool
breeze
that
always
visits
the
spot
beguile
you
into
a
second
pipe
ere
you
are
aware
el
mà
wa
el
khòdra
wa
el
widj
el
water
verdure
and
a
beautiful
face
says
an
old
arab
proverb
are
three
things
which
delight
the
heart
and
the
syrians
avow
that
all
three
are
to
be
found
in
damascus
not
only
on
the
three
sundays
of
each
week
but
every
day
in
the
gardens
about
the
city
you
may
see
whole
families
and
if
jews
or
christians
many
groups
of
families
spending
the
day
in
the
shade
beside
the
beautiful
waters
there
are
several
gardens
fitted
up
purposely
for
these
picnics
with
kiosks
fountains
and
pleasant
seats
under
the
trees
you
bring
your
pipes
your
provisions
and
the
like
with
you
but
servants
are
in
attendance
to
furnish
fire
and
water
and
coffee
for
which
on
leaving
you
give
them
a
small
gratuity
of
all
the
damascenes
i
have
yet
seen
there
is
not
one
but
declares
his
city
to
be
the
garden
of
the
world
the
pearl
of
the
orient
and
thanks
god
and
the
prophet
for
having
permitted
him
to
be
born
and
to
live
in
it
but
except
the
bazaars
the
khans
and
the
baths
of
which
there
are
several
most
luxurious
establishments
the
city
itself
is
neither
so
rich
nor
so
purely
saracenic
in
its
architecture
as
cairo
the
streets
are
narrow
and
dirty
and
the
houses
which
are
never
more
than
two
low
stories
in
height
are
built
of
bricks
coated
with
plaster
i
miss
the
solid
piles
of
stone
the
elegant
doorways
and
above
all
the
exquisite
hanging
balconies
of
carved
wood
which
meet
one
in
the
old
streets
of
cairo
damascus
is
the
representative
of
all
that
is
gay
brilliant
and
picturesque
in
oriental
life
but
for
stately
magnificence
cairo
and
i
suspect
baghdad
is
its
superior
we
visited
the
other
day
the
houses
of
some
of
the
richest
jews
and
christians
old
the
jewish
servant
of
the
hotel
accompanied
and
introduced
us
it
is
customary
for
travellers
to
make
these
visits
and
the
families
far
from
being
annoyed
are
flattered
by
it
the
exteriors
of
the
houses
are
mean
but
after
threading
a
narrow
passage
we
emerged
into
a
court
rivalling
in
profusion
of
ornament
and
rich
contrast
of
colors
one
early
idea
of
the
palace
of
aladdin
the
floors
and
fountains
are
all
of
marble
mosaic
the
arches
of
the
glitter
with
gold
and
the
walls
bewilder
the
eye
with
the
intricacy
of
their
adornments
in
the
first
house
we
were
received
by
the
family
in
a
room
of
precious
marbles
with
niches
in
the
walls
resembling
grottoes
of
silver
stalactites
the
cushions
of
the
divan
were
of
the
richest
silk
and
a
chandelier
of
bohemian
crystal
hung
from
the
ceiling
silver
narghilehs
were
brought
to
us
and
coffee
was
served
in
heavy
silver
the
lady
of
the
house
was
a
rather
corpulent
lady
of
about
and
wore
a
robe
of
embroidered
silk
and
lace
with
full
trowsers
gathered
at
the
ankles
and
yellow
slippers
her
black
hair
was
braided
and
fastened
at
the
end
with
golden
ornaments
and
the
light
scarf
twisted
around
her
head
blazed
with
diamonds
the
lids
of
her
large
eyes
were
stained
with
and
her
eyebrows
were
plucked
out
and
shaved
away
so
as
to
leave
only
a
thin
arched
line
as
if
drawn
with
a
pencil
above
each
eye
her
daughter
a
girl
of
fifteen
who
bore
the
genuine
hebrew
name
of
rachel
had
even
bigger
and
blacker
eyes
than
her
mother
but
her
forehead
was
low
her
mouth
large
and
the
expression
of
her
face
exceedingly
stupid
the
father
of
the
family
was
a
man
with
a
air
and
talked
with
an
oriental
politeness
which
was
very
refreshing
an
english
lady
who
was
of
our
party
said
to
him
through
me
that
if
she
possessed
such
a
house
she
should
be
willing
to
remain
in
damascus
why
does
she
leave
then
he
immediately
answered
this
is
her
house
and
everything
that
is
in
it
speaking
of
visiting
jerusalem
he
asked
me
whether
it
was
not
a
more
beautiful
city
than
damascus
it
is
not
more
beautiful
i
said
but
it
is
more
holy
an
expression
which
the
whole
company
received
with
great
satisfaction
the
second
house
we
visited
was
even
larger
and
richer
than
the
first
but
had
an
air
of
neglect
and
decay
the
slabs
of
rich
marble
were
loose
and
broken
about
the
edges
of
the
fountains
the
rich
painting
of
the
was
beginning
to
fade
and
the
balustrades
leading
to
the
upper
chambers
were
broken
off
in
places
we
were
ushered
into
a
room
the
walls
and
ceilings
of
which
were
composed
entirely
of
gilded
arabesque
set
with
small
mirrors
when
new
it
must
have
had
a
gorgeous
effect
but
the
gold
is
now
tarnished
and
the
glasses
dim
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
seated
on
the
cushions
dividing
her
time
between
her
pipe
and
her
she
merely
made
a
slight
inclination
of
her
head
as
we
entered
and
went
on
with
her
occupation
presently
her
two
daughters
and
an
abyssinian
slave
appeared
and
took
their
places
on
the
cushions
at
her
feet
the
whole
forming
a
charming
group
which
i
regretted
some
of
my
artist
friends
at
home
could
not
see
the
mistress
was
so
exceedingly
dignified
that
she
bestowed
but
few
words
on
us
she
seemed
to
resent
our
admiration
of
the
slave
who
was
a
most
graceful
creature
yet
her
jealousy
it
afterwards
appeared
had
reference
to
her
own
husband
for
we
had
scarcely
left
when
a
servant
followed
to
inform
the
english
lady
that
if
she
was
willing
to
buy
the
abyssinian
the
mistress
would
sell
her
at
once
for
two
thousand
piastres
the
last
visit
we
paid
was
to
the
dwelling
of
a
maronite
the
richest
christian
in
damascus
the
house
resembled
those
we
had
already
seen
except
that
having
been
recently
built
it
was
in
better
condition
and
exhibited
better
taste
in
the
ornaments
no
one
but
the
lady
was
allowed
to
enter
the
female
apartments
the
rest
of
us
being
entertained
by
the
proprietor
a
man
of
fifty
and
without
exception
the
handsomest
and
most
dignified
person
of
that
age
i
have
ever
seen
he
was
a
king
without
a
throne
and
fascinated
me
completely
by
the
noble
elegance
of
his
manner
in
any
country
but
the
orient
i
should
have
pronounced
him
incapable
of
an
unworthy
thought
here
he
may
be
exactly
the
reverse
although
damascus
is
considered
the
oldest
city
in
the
world
the
date
of
its
foundation
going
beyond
tradition
there
are
very
few
relics
of
antiquity
in
or
near
it
in
the
bazaar
are
three
large
pillars
supporting
half
the
pediment
which
are
said
to
have
belonged
to
the
christian
church
of
john
but
if
so
that
church
must
have
been
originally
a
roman
temple
part
of
the
roman
walls
and
one
of
the
city
gates
remain
and
we
saw
the
spot
where
according
to
tradition
saul
was
let
down
from
the
wall
in
a
basket
there
are
two
localities
pointed
out
as
the
scene
of
his
conversion
which
from
his
own
account
occurred
near
the
city
i
visited
a
subterranean
chapel
claimed
by
the
latin
monks
to
be
the
cellar
of
the
house
of
ananias
in
which
the
apostle
was
concealed
the
cellar
is
undoubtedly
of
great
antiquity
but
as
the
whole
quarter
was
for
many
centuries
inhabited
wholly
by
turks
it
would
be
curious
to
know
how
the
monks
ascertained
which
was
the
house
of
ananias
as
for
the
street
called
straight
it
would
be
difficult
at
present
to
find
any
in
damascus
corresponding
to
that
epithet
the
famous
damascus
blades
so
renowned
in
the
time
of
the
crusaders
are
made
here
no
longer
the
art
has
been
lost
for
three
or
four
centuries
yet
genuine
old
swords
of
the
true
steel
are
occasionally
to
be
found
they
are
readily
distinguished
from
modern
imitations
by
their
clear
and
silvery
ring
when
struck
and
by
the
finely
watered
appearance
of
the
blade
produced
by
its
having
been
first
made
of
woven
wire
and
then
worked
over
and
over
again
until
it
attained
the
requisite
temper
a
droll
turk
who
is
the
or
chief
of
the
auctioneers
and
is
nicknamed
the
father
of
the
antiques
has
a
large
collection
of
sabres
daggers
pieces
of
mail
shields
pipes
rings
seals
and
other
ancient
articles
he
demands
enormous
prices
but
generally
takes
about
of
what
he
first
asks
i
have
spent
several
hours
in
his
curiosity
shop
bargaining
for
turquoise
rings
carbuncles
persian
amulets
and
circassian
daggers
while
looking
over
some
old
swords
the
other
day
i
noticed
one
of
exquisite
temper
but
with
a
shorter
blade
than
usual
the
point
had
apparently
been
snapped
off
in
fight
but
owing
to
the
excellence
of
the
sword
or
the
owner
affection
for
it
the
steel
had
been
carefully
shaped
into
a
new
point
asked
five
hundred
piastres
and
i
who
had
taken
a
particular
fancy
to
possess
it
offered
him
two
hundred
in
an
indifferent
way
and
then
laid
it
aside
to
examine
other
articles
after
his
refusal
to
accept
my
offer
i
said
nothing
more
and
was
leaving
the
shop
when
the
old
fellow
called
me
back
saying
you
have
forgotten
your
sword
which
i
thereupon
took
at
my
own
price
i
have
shown
it
to
wood
the
british
consul
who
pronounced
it
an
extremely
fine
specimen
of
damascus
steel
and
on
reading
the
inscription
enamelled
upon
the
blade
ascertains
that
it
was
made
in
the
year
of
the
hegira
which
corresponds
to
this
was
during
the
caliphate
of
haroun
and
who
knows
but
the
sword
may
have
once
flashed
in
the
presence
of
that
great
and
glorious
sovereign
nay
been
drawn
by
his
own
hand
who
knows
but
that
the
milan
armor
of
the
crusaders
may
have
shivered
its
point
on
the
field
of
askalon
i
kiss
the
veined
azure
of
thy
blade
o
sword
of
haroun
i
hang
the
crimson
cords
of
thy
scabbard
upon
my
shoulder
and
thou
shalt
henceforth
clank
in
silver
music
at
my
side
singing
to
my
ear
and
mine
alone
thy
chants
of
battle
thy
rejoicing
songs
of
slaughter
yesterday
evening
three
gentlemen
of
lord
dalkeith
party
arrived
from
a
trip
to
palmyra
the
road
thither
lies
through
a
part
of
the
syrian
desert
belonging
to
the
aneyzeh
tribe
who
are
now
supposed
to
be
in
league
with
the
druses
against
the
government
including
this
party
only
six
persons
have
succeeded
in
reaching
palmyra
within
a
year
and
two
of
them
noel
and
cathcart
were
imprisoned
four
days
by
the
arabs
and
only
escaped
by
the
accidental
departure
of
a
caravan
for
damascus
the
present
party
was
obliged
to
travel
almost
wholly
by
night
running
the
gauntlet
of
a
dozen
arab
encampments
and
was
only
allowed
a
day
stay
at
palmyra
they
were
all
disguised
as
bedouins
and
took
nothing
with
them
but
the
necessary
provisions
they
made
their
appearance
here
last
evening
in
long
white
abas
with
the
bedouin
bound
over
their
heads
their
faces
burnt
their
eyes
inflamed
and
their
frames
feverish
with
seven
days
and
nights
of
travel
the
shekh
who
conducted
them
was
not
an
aneyzeh
and
would
have
lost
his
life
had
they
fallen
in
with
any
of
that
tribe
chapter
x
the
visions
of
hasheesh
exulting
trembling
raging
fainting
possessed
beyond
the
muse
painting
collins
during
my
stay
in
damascus
that
insatiable
curiosity
which
leads
me
to
prefer
the
acquisition
of
all
lawful
knowledge
through
the
channels
of
my
own
personal
experience
rather
than
in
less
satisfactory
and
less
laborious
ways
induced
me
to
make
a
trial
of
the
celebrated
that
remarkable
drug
which
supplies
the
luxurious
syrian
with
dreams
more
alluring
and
more
gorgeous
than
the
chinese
extracts
from
his
darling
opium
pipe
the
use
of
hasheesh
which
is
a
preparation
of
the
dried
leaves
of
the
has
been
familiar
to
the
east
for
many
centuries
during
the
crusades
it
was
frequently
used
by
the
saracen
warriors
to
stimulate
them
to
the
work
of
slaughter
and
from
the
arabic
term
of
or
eaters
of
hasheesh
as
applied
to
them
the
word
assassin
has
been
naturally
derived
an
infusion
of
the
same
plant
gives
to
the
drink
called
which
is
in
common
use
throughout
india
and
malaysia
its
peculiar
properties
thus
prepared
it
is
a
more
fierce
and
fatal
stimulant
than
the
paste
of
sugar
and
spices
to
which
the
turk
resorts
as
the
food
of
his
voluptuous
evening
reveries
while
its
immediate
effects
seem
to
be
more
potent
than
those
of
opium
its
habitual
use
though
attended
with
ultimate
and
permanent
injury
to
the
system
rarely
results
in
such
utter
wreck
of
mind
and
body
as
that
to
which
the
votaries
of
the
latter
drug
inevitably
condemn
themselves
a
previous
experience
of
the
effects
of
hasheesh
which
i
took
once
and
in
a
very
mild
form
while
in
egypt
was
so
peculiar
in
its
character
that
my
curiosity
instead
of
being
satisfied
only
prompted
me
the
more
to
throw
myself
for
once
wholly
under
its
influence
the
sensations
it
then
produced
were
those
physically
of
exquisite
lightness
and
airiness
of
a
wonderfully
keen
perception
of
the
ludicrous
in
the
most
simple
and
familiar
objects
during
the
half
hour
in
which
it
lasted
i
was
at
no
time
so
far
under
its
control
that
i
could
not
with
the
clearest
perception
study
the
changes
through
which
i
passed
i
noted
with
careful
attention
the
fine
sensations
which
spread
throughout
the
whole
tissue
of
my
nervous
fibre
each
thrill
helping
to
divest
my
frame
of
its
earthy
and
material
nature
until
my
substance
appeared
to
me
no
grosser
than
the
vapors
of
the
atmosphere
and
while
sitting
in
the
calm
of
the
egyptian
twilight
i
expected
to
be
lifted
up
and
carried
away
by
the
first
breeze
that
should
ruffle
the
nile
while
this
process
was
going
on
the
objects
by
which
i
was
surrounded
assumed
a
strange
and
whimsical
expression
my
pipe
the
oars
which
my
boatmen
plied
the
turban
worn
by
the
captain
the
and
culinary
implements
became
in
themselves
so
inexpressibly
absurd
and
comical
that
i
was
provoked
into
a
long
fit
of
laughter
the
hallucination
died
away
as
gradually
as
it
came
leaving
me
overcome
with
a
soft
and
pleasant
drowsiness
from
which
i
sank
into
a
deep
refreshing
sleep
my
companion
and
an
english
gentleman
who
with
his
wife
was
also
residing
in
antonio
pleasant
caravanserai
agreed
to
join
me
in
the
experiment
the
dragoman
of
the
latter
was
deputed
to
procure
a
sufficient
quantity
of
the
drug
he
was
a
dark
egyptian
speaking
only
the
of
the
east
and
asked
me
as
he
took
the
money
and
departed
on
his
mission
whether
he
should
get
hasheesh
ridere
a
per
dormire
oh
of
course
i
answered
and
see
that
it
be
strong
and
fresh
it
is
customary
with
the
syrians
to
take
a
small
portion
immediately
before
the
evening
meal
as
it
is
thus
diffused
through
the
stomach
and
acts
more
gradually
as
well
as
more
gently
upon
the
system
as
our
was
at
sunset
i
proposed
taking
hasheesh
at
that
time
but
my
friends
fearing
that
its
operation
might
be
more
speedy
upon
fresh
subjects
and
thus
betray
them
into
some
absurdity
in
the
presence
of
the
other
travellers
preferred
waiting
until
after
the
meal
it
was
then
agreed
that
we
should
retire
to
our
room
which
as
it
rose
like
a
tower
one
story
higher
than
the
rest
of
the
building
was
in
a
manner
isolated
and
would
screen
us
from
observation
we
commenced
by
taking
a
each
of
the
mixture
which
abdallah
had
procured
this
was
about
the
quantity
i
had
taken
in
egypt
and
as
the
effect
then
had
been
so
slight
i
judged
that
we
ran
no
risk
of
taking
an
the
strength
of
the
drug
however
must
have
been
far
greater
in
this
instance
for
whereas
i
could
in
the
former
case
distinguish
no
flavor
but
that
of
sugar
and
rose
leaves
i
now
found
the
taste
intensely
bitter
and
repulsive
to
the
palate
we
allowed
the
paste
to
dissolve
slowly
on
our
tongues
and
sat
some
time
quietly
waiting
the
result
but
having
been
taken
upon
a
full
stomach
its
operation
was
hindered
and
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
an
hour
we
could
not
detect
the
least
change
in
our
feelings
my
friends
loudly
expressed
their
conviction
of
the
humbug
of
hasheesh
but
i
unwilling
to
give
up
the
experiment
at
this
point
proposed
that
we
should
take
an
additional
half
spoonful
and
follow
it
with
a
cup
of
hot
tea
which
if
there
were
really
any
virtue
in
the
preparation
could
not
fail
to
call
it
into
action
this
was
done
though
not
without
some
misgivings
as
we
were
all
ignorant
of
the
precise
quantity
which
constituted
a
dose
and
the
limits
within
which
the
drug
could
be
taken
with
safety
it
was
now
ten
the
streets
of
damascus
were
gradually
becoming
silent
and
the
fair
city
was
bathed
in
the
yellow
lustre
of
the
syrian
moon
only
in
the
marble
below
us
a
few
dragomen
and
lingered
under
the
and
beside
the
fountain
in
the
centre
i
was
seated
alone
nearly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
talking
with
my
friends
who
were
lounging
upon
a
sofa
placed
in
a
sort
of
alcove
at
the
farther
end
when
the
same
fine
nervous
thrill
of
which
i
have
spoken
suddenly
shot
through
me
but
this
time
it
was
accompanied
with
a
burning
sensation
at
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
instead
of
growing
upon
me
with
the
gradual
pace
of
healthy
slumber
and
resolving
me
as
before
into
air
it
came
with
the
intensity
of
a
pang
and
shot
throbbing
along
the
nerves
to
the
extremities
of
my
body
the
sense
of
limitation
the
confinement
of
our
senses
within
the
bounds
of
our
own
flesh
and
blood
instantly
fell
away
the
walls
of
my
frame
were
burst
outward
and
tumbled
into
ruin
and
without
thinking
what
form
i
wore
losing
sight
even
of
all
idea
of
form
i
felt
that
i
existed
throughout
a
vast
extent
of
space
the
blood
pulsed
from
my
heart
sped
through
uncounted
leagues
before
it
reached
my
extremities
the
air
drawn
into
my
lungs
expanded
into
seas
of
limpid
ether
and
the
arch
of
my
skull
was
broader
than
the
vault
of
heaven
within
the
concave
that
held
my
brain
were
the
fathomless
deeps
of
blue
clouds
floated
there
and
the
winds
of
heaven
rolled
them
together
and
there
shone
the
orb
of
the
sun
it
was
though
i
thought
not
of
that
at
the
time
like
a
revelation
of
the
mystery
of
omnipresence
it
is
difficult
to
describe
this
sensation
or
the
rapidity
with
which
it
mastered
me
in
the
state
of
mental
exaltation
in
which
i
was
then
plunged
all
sensations
as
they
rose
suggested
more
or
less
coherent
images
they
presented
themselves
to
me
in
a
double
form
one
physical
and
therefore
to
a
certain
extent
tangible
the
other
spiritual
and
revealing
itself
in
a
succession
of
splendid
metaphors
the
physical
feeling
of
extended
being
was
accompanied
by
the
image
of
an
exploding
meteor
not
subsiding
into
darkness
but
continuing
to
shoot
from
its
centre
or
nucleus
which
corresponded
to
the
burning
spot
at
the
pit
of
my
stomach
incessant
adumbrations
of
light
that
finally
lost
themselves
in
the
infinity
of
space
to
my
mind
even
now
this
image
is
still
the
best
illustration
of
my
sensations
as
i
recall
them
but
i
greatly
doubt
whether
the
reader
will
find
it
equally
clear
my
curiosity
was
now
in
a
way
of
being
satisfied
the
spirit
demon
shall
i
not
rather
say
of
hasheesh
had
entire
possession
of
me
i
was
cast
upon
the
flood
of
his
illusions
and
drifted
helplessly
whithersoever
they
might
choose
to
bear
me
the
thrills
which
ran
through
my
nervous
system
became
more
rapid
and
fierce
accompanied
with
sensations
that
steeped
my
whole
being
in
unutterable
rapture
i
was
encompassed
by
a
sea
of
light
through
which
played
the
pure
harmonious
colors
that
are
born
of
light
while
endeavoring
in
broken
expressions
to
describe
my
feelings
to
my
friends
who
sat
looking
upon
me
incredulously
not
yet
having
been
affected
by
the
drug
i
suddenly
found
myself
at
the
foot
of
the
great
pyramid
of
cheops
the
tapering
courses
of
yellow
limestone
gleamed
like
gold
in
the
sun
and
the
pile
rose
so
high
that
it
seemed
to
lean
for
support
upon
the
blue
arch
of
the
sky
i
wished
to
ascend
it
and
the
wish
alone
placed
me
immediately
upon
its
apex
lifted
thousands
of
feet
above
the
and
of
egypt
i
cast
my
eyes
downward
and
to
my
astonishment
saw
that
it
was
built
not
of
limestone
but
of
huge
square
plugs
of
cavendish
tobacco
words
can
not
paint
the
overwhelming
sense
of
the
ludicrous
which
i
then
experienced
i
writhed
on
my
chair
in
an
agony
of
laughter
which
was
only
relieved
by
the
vision
melting
away
like
a
dissolving
view
till
out
of
my
confusion
of
indistinct
images
and
fragments
of
images
another
and
more
wonderful
vision
arose
the
more
vividly
i
recall
the
scene
which
followed
the
more
carefully
i
restore
its
different
features
and
separate
the
many
threads
of
sensation
which
it
wove
into
one
gorgeous
web
the
more
i
despair
of
representing
its
exceeding
glory
i
was
moving
over
the
desert
not
upon
the
rocking
dromedary
but
seated
in
a
barque
made
of
and
studded
with
jewels
of
surpassing
lustre
the
sand
was
of
grains
of
gold
and
my
keel
slid
through
them
without
jar
or
sound
the
air
was
radiant
with
excess
of
light
though
no
sun
was
to
be
seen
i
inhaled
the
most
delicious
perfumes
and
harmonies
such
as
beethoven
may
have
heard
in
dreams
but
never
wrote
floated
around
me
the
atmosphere
itself
was
light
odor
music
and
each
and
all
sublimated
beyond
anything
the
sober
senses
are
capable
of
receiving
before
me
for
a
thousand
leagues
as
it
seemed
stretched
a
vista
of
rainbows
whose
colors
gleamed
with
the
splendor
of
gems
arches
of
living
amethyst
sapphire
emerald
topaz
and
ruby
by
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
they
flew
past
me
as
my
dazzling
barge
sped
down
the
magnificent
arcade
yet
the
vista
still
stretched
as
far
as
ever
before
me
i
revelled
in
a
sensuous
elysium
which
was
perfect
because
no
sense
was
left
ungratified
but
beyond
all
my
mind
was
filled
with
a
boundless
feeling
of
triumph
my
journey
was
that
of
a
conqueror
not
of
a
conqueror
who
subdues
his
race
either
by
love
or
by
will
for
i
forgot
that
man
existed
but
one
victorious
over
the
grandest
as
well
as
the
subtlest
forces
of
nature
the
spirits
of
light
color
odor
sound
and
motion
were
my
slaves
and
having
these
i
was
master
of
the
universe
those
who
are
endowed
to
any
extent
with
the
imaginative
faculty
must
have
at
least
once
in
their
lives
experienced
feelings
which
may
give
them
a
clue
to
the
exalted
sensuous
raptures
of
my
triumphal
march
the
view
of
a
sublime
mountain
landscape
the
hearing
of
a
grand
orchestral
symphony
or
of
a
choral
upborne
by
the
organ
or
even
the
beauty
and
luxury
of
a
cloudless
summer
day
suggests
emotions
similar
in
kind
if
less
intense
they
took
a
warmth
and
glow
from
that
pure
animal
joy
which
degrades
not
but
spiritualizes
and
ennobles
our
material
part
and
which
differs
from
cold
abstract
intellectual
enjoyment
as
the
flaming
diamond
of
the
orient
differs
from
the
icicle
of
the
north
those
finer
senses
which
occupy
a
middle
ground
between
our
animal
and
intellectual
appetites
were
suddenly
developed
to
a
pitch
beyond
what
i
had
ever
dreamed
and
being
thus
at
one
and
the
same
time
gratified
to
the
fullest
extent
of
their
preternatural
capacity
the
result
was
a
single
harmonious
sensation
to
describe
which
human
language
has
no
epithet
paradise
with
its
palaces
of
ruby
and
emerald
its
airs
of
musk
and
cassia
and
its
rivers
colder
than
snow
and
sweeter
than
honey
would
have
been
a
poor
and
mean
terminus
for
my
arcade
of
rainbows
yet
in
the
character
of
this
paradise
in
the
gorgeous
fancies
of
the
arabian
nights
in
the
glow
and
luxury
of
all
oriental
poetry
i
now
recognize
more
or
less
of
the
agency
of
hasheesh
the
fulness
of
my
rapture
expanded
the
sense
of
time
and
though
the
whole
vision
was
probably
not
more
than
five
minutes
in
passing
through
my
mind
years
seemed
to
have
elapsed
while
i
shot
under
the
dazzling
myriads
of
rainbow
arches
by
and
by
the
rainbows
the
barque
of
pearl
and
jewels
and
the
desert
of
golden
sand
vanished
and
still
bathed
in
light
and
perfume
i
found
myself
in
a
land
of
green
and
flowery
lawns
divided
by
hills
of
gently
undulating
outline
but
although
the
vegetation
was
the
richest
of
earth
there
were
neither
streams
nor
fountains
to
be
seen
and
the
people
who
came
from
the
hills
with
brilliant
garments
that
shone
in
the
sun
besought
me
to
give
them
the
blessing
of
water
their
hands
were
full
of
branches
of
the
coral
honeysuckle
in
bloom
these
i
took
and
breaking
off
the
flowers
one
by
one
set
them
in
the
earth
the
slender
tubes
immediately
became
shafts
of
masonry
and
sank
deep
into
the
earth
the
lip
of
the
flower
changed
into
a
circular
mouth
of
marble
and
the
people
leaning
over
its
brink
lowered
their
pitchers
to
the
bottom
with
cords
and
drew
them
up
again
filled
to
the
brim
and
dripping
with
honey
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
these
illusions
was
that
at
the
time
when
i
was
most
completely
under
their
influence
i
knew
myself
to
be
seated
in
the
tower
of
antonio
hotel
in
damascus
knew
that
i
had
taken
hasheesh
and
that
the
strange
gorgeous
and
ludicrous
fancies
which
possessed
me
were
the
effect
of
it
at
the
very
same
instant
that
i
looked
upon
the
valley
of
the
nile
from
the
pyramid
slid
over
the
desert
or
created
my
marvellous
wells
in
that
beautiful
pastoral
country
i
saw
the
furniture
of
my
room
its
mosaic
pavement
the
quaint
saracenic
niches
in
the
walls
the
painted
and
gilded
beams
of
the
ceiling
and
the
couch
in
the
recess
before
me
with
my
two
companions
watching
me
both
sensations
were
simultaneous
and
equally
palpable
while
i
was
most
given
up
to
the
magnificent
delusion
i
saw
its
cause
and
felt
its
absurdity
most
clearly
metaphysicians
say
that
the
mind
is
incapable
of
performing
two
operations
at
the
same
time
and
may
attempt
to
explain
this
phenomenon
by
supposing
a
rapid
and
incessant
vibration
of
the
perceptions
between
the
two
states
this
explanation
however
is
not
satisfactory
to
me
for
not
more
clearly
does
a
skilful
musician
with
the
same
breath
blow
two
distinct
musical
notes
from
a
bugle
than
i
was
conscious
of
two
distinct
conditions
of
being
in
the
same
moment
yet
singular
as
it
may
seem
neither
conflicted
with
the
other
my
enjoyment
of
the
visions
was
complete
and
absolute
undisturbed
by
the
faintest
doubt
of
their
reality
while
in
some
other
chamber
of
my
brain
reason
sat
coolly
watching
them
and
heaping
the
liveliest
ridicule
on
their
fantastic
features
one
set
of
nerves
was
thrilled
with
the
bliss
of
the
gods
while
another
was
convulsed
with
unquenchable
laughter
at
that
very
bliss
my
highest
ecstacies
could
not
bear
down
and
silence
the
weight
of
my
ridicule
which
in
its
turn
was
powerless
to
prevent
me
from
running
into
other
and
more
gorgeous
absurdities
i
was
double
not
swan
and
shadow
but
rather
human
and
beast
a
true
sphinx
i
was
a
riddle
and
a
mystery
to
myself
the
drug
which
had
been
retarded
in
its
operation
on
account
of
having
been
taken
after
a
meal
now
began
to
make
itself
more
powerfully
felt
the
visions
were
more
grotesque
than
ever
but
less
agreeable
and
there
was
a
painful
tension
throughout
my
nervous
system
the
effect
of
i
was
a
mass
of
transparent
jelly
and
a
confectioner
poured
me
into
a
twisted
mould
i
threw
my
chair
aside
and
writhed
and
tortured
myself
for
some
time
to
force
my
loose
substance
into
the
mould
at
last
when
i
had
so
far
succeeded
that
only
one
foot
remained
outside
it
was
lifted
off
and
another
mould
of
still
more
crooked
and
intricate
shape
substituted
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
contortions
through
which
i
went
to
accomplish
the
end
of
my
gelatinous
destiny
would
have
been
extremely
ludicrous
to
a
spectator
but
to
me
they
were
painful
and
disagreeable
the
sober
half
of
me
went
into
fits
of
laughter
over
them
and
through
that
laughter
my
vision
shifted
into
another
scene
i
had
laughed
until
my
eyes
overflowed
profusely
every
drop
that
fell
immediately
became
a
large
loaf
of
bread
and
tumbled
upon
the
of
a
baker
in
the
bazaar
at
damascus
the
more
i
laughed
the
faster
the
loaves
fell
until
such
a
pile
was
raised
about
the
baker
that
i
could
hardly
see
the
top
of
his
head
the
man
will
be
suffocated
i
cried
but
if
he
were
to
die
i
can
not
stop
my
perceptions
now
became
more
dim
and
confused
i
felt
that
i
was
in
the
grasp
of
some
giant
force
and
in
the
glimmering
of
my
fading
reason
grew
earnestly
alarmed
for
the
terrible
stress
under
which
my
frame
labored
increased
every
moment
a
fierce
and
furious
heat
radiated
from
my
stomach
throughout
my
system
my
mouth
and
throat
were
as
dry
and
hard
as
if
made
of
brass
and
my
tongue
it
seemed
to
me
was
a
bar
of
rusty
iron
i
seized
a
pitcher
of
water
and
drank
long
and
deeply
but
i
might
as
well
have
drunk
so
much
air
for
not
only
did
it
impart
no
moisture
but
my
palate
and
throat
gave
me
no
intelligence
of
having
drunk
at
all
i
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
brandishing
my
arms
convulsively
an
heaving
sighs
that
seemed
to
shatter
my
whole
being
will
no
one
i
cried
in
distress
cast
out
this
devil
that
has
possession
of
me
i
no
longer
saw
the
room
nor
my
friends
but
i
heard
one
of
them
saying
it
must
be
real
he
could
not
counterfeit
such
an
expression
as
that
but
it
do
look
much
like
pleasure
immediately
afterwards
there
was
a
scream
of
the
wildest
laughter
and
my
countryman
sprang
upon
the
floor
exclaiming
o
ye
gods
i
am
a
locomotive
this
was
his
ruling
hallucination
and
for
the
space
of
two
or
three
hours
he
continued
to
pace
to
and
fro
with
a
measured
stride
exhaling
his
breath
in
violent
jets
and
when
he
spoke
dividing
his
words
into
syllables
each
of
which
he
brought
out
with
a
jerk
at
the
same
time
turning
his
hands
at
his
sides
as
if
they
were
the
cranks
of
imaginary
wheels
the
englishman
as
soon
as
he
felt
the
dose
beginning
to
take
effect
prudently
retreated
to
his
own
room
and
what
the
nature
of
his
visions
was
we
never
learned
for
he
refused
to
tell
and
moreover
enjoined
the
strictest
silence
on
his
wife
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
midnight
i
had
passed
through
the
paradise
of
hasheesh
and
was
plunged
at
once
into
its
fiercest
hell
in
my
ignorance
i
had
taken
what
i
have
since
learned
would
have
been
a
sufficient
portion
for
six
men
and
was
now
paying
a
frightful
penalty
for
my
curiosity
the
excited
blood
rushed
through
my
frame
with
a
sound
like
the
roaring
of
mighty
waters
it
was
projected
into
my
eyes
until
i
could
no
longer
see
it
beat
thickly
in
my
ears
and
so
throbbed
in
my
heart
that
i
feared
the
ribs
would
give
way
under
its
blows
i
tore
open
my
vest
placed
my
hand
over
the
spot
and
tried
to
count
the
pulsations
but
there
were
two
hearts
one
beating
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
beats
a
minute
and
the
other
with
a
slow
dull
motion
my
throat
i
thought
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
blood
and
streams
of
blood
were
pouring
from
my
ears
i
felt
them
gushing
warm
down
my
cheeks
and
neck
with
a
maddened
desperate
feeling
i
fled
from
the
room
and
walked
over
the
flat
terraced
roof
of
the
house
my
body
seemed
to
shrink
and
grow
rigid
as
i
wrestled
with
the
demon
and
my
face
to
become
wild
lean
and
haggard
some
lines
which
had
struck
me
years
before
in
reading
browning
rhyme
of
the
duchess
may
flashed
into
my
mind
and
the
horse
in
stark
despair
with
his
front
hoofs
poised
in
air
on
the
last
verge
rears
amain
and
he
hangs
he
rocks
between
and
his
nostrils
curdle
in
and
he
shivers
head
and
hoof
and
the
flakes
of
foam
fall
off
and
his
face
grows
fierce
and
thin
that
picture
of
animal
terror
and
agony
was
mine
i
was
the
horse
hanging
poised
on
the
verge
of
the
giddy
tower
the
next
moment
to
be
borne
sheer
down
to
destruction
involuntarily
i
raised
my
hand
to
feel
the
leanness
and
sharpness
of
my
face
oh
horror
the
flesh
had
fallen
from
my
bones
and
it
was
a
skeleton
head
that
i
carried
on
my
shoulders
with
one
bound
i
sprang
to
the
parapet
and
looked
down
into
the
silent
courtyard
then
filled
with
the
shadows
thrown
into
it
by
the
sinking
moon
shall
i
cast
myself
down
headlong
was
the
question
i
proposed
to
myself
but
though
the
horror
of
that
skeleton
delusion
was
greater
than
my
fear
of
death
there
was
an
invisible
hand
at
my
breast
which
pushed
me
away
from
the
brink
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
room
in
a
state
of
the
keenest
suffering
my
companion
was
still
a
locomotive
rushing
to
and
fro
and
jerking
out
his
syllables
with
the
disjointed
accent
peculiar
to
a
his
mouth
had
turned
to
brass
like
mine
and
he
raised
the
pitcher
to
his
lips
in
the
attempt
to
moisten
it
but
before
he
had
taken
a
mouthful
set
the
pitcher
down
again
with
a
yell
of
laughter
crying
out
how
can
i
take
water
into
my
boiler
while
i
am
letting
off
steam
but
i
was
now
too
far
gone
to
feel
the
absurdity
of
this
or
his
other
exclamations
i
was
sinking
deeper
and
deeper
into
a
pit
of
unutterable
agony
and
despair
for
although
i
was
not
conscious
of
real
pain
in
any
part
of
my
body
the
cruel
tension
to
which
my
nerves
had
been
subjected
filled
me
through
and
through
with
a
sensation
of
distress
which
was
far
more
severe
than
pain
itself
in
addition
to
this
the
remnant
of
will
with
which
i
struggled
against
the
demon
became
gradually
weaker
and
i
felt
that
i
should
soon
be
powerless
in
his
hands
every
effort
to
preserve
my
reason
was
accompanied
by
a
pang
of
mortal
fear
lest
what
i
now
experienced
was
insanity
and
would
hold
mastery
over
me
for
ever
the
thought
of
death
which
also
haunted
me
was
far
less
bitter
than
this
dread
i
knew
that
in
the
struggle
which
was
going
on
in
my
frame
i
was
borne
fearfully
near
the
dark
gulf
and
the
thought
that
at
such
a
time
both
reason
and
will
were
leaving
my
brain
filled
me
with
an
agony
the
depth
and
blackness
of
which
i
should
vainly
attempt
to
portray
i
threw
myself
on
my
bed
with
the
excited
blood
still
roaring
wildly
in
my
ears
my
heart
throbbing
with
a
force
that
seemed
to
be
rapidly
wearing
away
my
life
my
throat
dry
as
a
and
my
stiffened
tongue
cleaving
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
resisting
no
longer
but
awaiting
my
fate
with
the
apathy
of
despair
my
companion
was
now
approaching
the
same
condition
but
as
the
effect
of
the
drug
on
him
had
been
less
violent
so
his
stage
of
suffering
was
more
clamorous
he
cried
out
to
me
that
he
was
dying
implored
me
to
help
him
and
reproached
me
vehemently
because
i
lay
there
silent
motionless
and
apparently
careless
of
his
danger
why
will
he
disturb
me
i
thought
he
thinks
he
is
dying
but
what
is
death
to
madness
let
him
die
a
thousand
deaths
were
more
easily
borne
than
the
pangs
i
suffer
while
i
was
sufficiently
conscious
to
hear
his
exclamations
they
only
provoked
my
keen
anger
but
after
a
time
my
senses
became
clouded
and
i
sank
into
a
stupor
as
near
as
i
can
judge
this
must
have
been
three
in
the
morning
rather
more
than
five
hours
after
the
hasheesh
began
to
take
effect
i
lay
thus
all
the
following
day
and
night
in
a
state
of
gray
blank
oblivion
broken
only
by
a
single
wandering
gleam
of
consciousness
i
recollect
hearing
françois
voice
he
told
me
afterwards
that
i
arose
attempted
to
dress
myself
drank
two
cups
of
coffee
and
then
fell
back
into
the
same
stupor
but
of
all
this
i
did
not
retain
the
least
knowledge
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
after
a
sleep
of
thirty
hours
i
awoke
again
to
the
world
with
a
system
utterly
prostrate
and
unstrung
and
a
brain
clouded
with
the
lingering
images
of
my
visions
i
knew
where
i
was
and
what
had
happened
to
me
but
all
that
i
saw
still
remained
unreal
and
shadowy
there
was
no
taste
in
what
i
ate
no
refreshment
in
what
i
drank
and
it
required
a
painful
effort
to
comprehend
what
was
said
to
me
and
return
a
coherent
answer
will
and
reason
had
come
back
but
they
still
sat
unsteadily
upon
their
thrones
my
friend
who
was
much
further
advanced
in
his
recovery
accompanied
me
to
the
adjoining
bath
which
i
hoped
would
assist
in
restoring
me
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
i
preserved
the
outward
appearance
of
consciousness
in
spite
of
myself
a
veil
now
and
then
fell
over
my
mind
and
after
wandering
for
years
as
it
seemed
in
some
distant
world
i
awoke
with
a
shock
to
find
myself
in
the
steamy
halls
of
the
bath
with
a
brown
syrian
polishing
my
limbs
i
suspect
that
my
language
must
have
been
rambling
and
incoherent
and
that
the
menials
who
had
me
in
charge
understood
my
condition
for
as
soon
as
i
had
stretched
myself
upon
the
couch
which
follows
the
bath
a
glass
of
very
acid
sherbet
was
presented
to
me
and
after
drinking
it
i
experienced
instant
relief
still
the
spell
was
not
wholly
broken
and
for
two
or
three
days
i
continued
subject
to
frequent
involuntary
fits
of
absence
which
made
me
insensible
for
the
time
to
all
that
was
passing
around
me
i
walked
the
streets
of
damascus
with
a
strange
consciousness
that
i
was
in
some
other
place
at
the
same
time
and
with
a
constant
effort
to
reunite
my
divided
perceptions
previous
to
the
experiment
we
had
decided
on
making
a
bargain
with
the
shekh
for
the
journey
to
palmyra
the
state
however
in
which
we
now
found
ourselves
obliged
us
to
relinquish
the
plan
perhaps
the
excitement
of
a
forced
march
across
the
desert
and
a
conflict
with
the
hostile
arabs
which
was
quite
likely
to
happen
might
have
assisted
us
in
throwing
off
the
baneful
effects
of
the
drug
but
all
the
charm
which
lay
in
the
name
of
palmyra
and
the
romantic
interest
of
the
trip
was
gone
i
was
without
courage
and
without
energy
and
nothing
remained
for
me
but
to
leave
damascus
yet
fearful
as
my
rash
experiment
proved
to
me
i
did
not
regret
having
made
it
it
revealed
to
me
deeps
of
rapture
and
of
suffering
which
my
natural
faculties
never
could
have
sounded
it
has
taught
me
the
majesty
of
human
reason
and
of
human
will
even
in
the
weakest
and
the
awful
peril
of
tampering
with
that
which
assails
their
integrity
i
have
here
faithfully
and
fully
written
out
my
experience
on
account
of
the
lesson
which
it
may
convey
to
others
if
i
have
unfortunately
failed
in
my
design
and
have
but
awakened
that
restless
curiosity
which
i
have
endeavored
to
forestall
let
me
beg
all
who
are
thereby
led
to
repeat
the
experiment
upon
themselves
that
they
be
content
to
take
the
portion
of
hasheesh
which
is
considered
sufficient
for
one
man

now
see
whether
abana

the

the

or
melts
languidly

the

that

and
the
solemn
meditations
of
mahomet
is
only
to
be
found
under
an
oriental

the
naked
natives
of
the
torrid
zone
are
amphibious
they
do
not
bathe
they
live
in
the
water
the
european
and
wash
themselves
and
think
they
have
bathed
they
shudder
under
cold
showers
and
perform
laborious
antics
with
coarse
towels
as
for
the
hydropathist
the
genius
of
the

whose
dwelling
is
in
damascus
would
be
convulsed
with
scornful
laughter
could
he
behold
that
aqueous
diogenes
sitting
in

tub
or
stretched
out
in
his
wet
wrappings
like
a
sodden
mummy
in
a
catacomb
of
blankets
and
feather
beds
as
the
rose
in
the
east
has
a
rarer
perfume
than
in
other
lands
so
does
the
bath
bestow
a
superior
purification
and
impart
a
more
profound
enjoyment
listen
not
unto
the
lamentations
of
travellers
who
complain
of
the
heat
and
the
steam
and
the
dislocations
of
their
joints
they
belong
to
the
generation
who
resist
the
processes
whereunto
the
oriental
yields
himself
body
and
soul
he
who
is
bathed
in
damascus
must
be
as
clay
in
the
hands
of
a
potter
the
syrians
marvel
how
the
franks
can
walk
so
difficult
is
it
to
bend
their
joints
moreover
they
know
the
difference
between
him
who
comes
to
the
bath
out
of
a
mere
idle
curiosity
and
him
who
has
tasted
its
delight
and
holds
it
in
due
honor
only
the
latter
is
permitted
to
know
all
its
mysteries
the
former
is
carelessly
hurried
through
the
ordinary
forms
of
bathing
and
if
any
trace
of
the
cockney
remain
in
him
is
quite
as
likely
to
be
disgusted
as
pleased
again
there
are
many
second

baths
whither
cheating
dragomen
conduct
their
victims
in
consideration
of
a
division
of
spoils
with
the
hence
it
is
that
the
bath
has
received
but
partial
justice
at
the
hands
of
tourists
in
the
east
if
any
one
doubts
this
let
him
clothe
himself
with
oriental
passiveness
and
resignation
go
to
the
hamman
at
damascus
or
the
bath
of
mahmoud
pasha
at
constantinople
and
demand
that
he
be
perfectly
bathed
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
the
mysteries
of
the
perfect
bath
here
is
the
entrance
a
heavy
saracenic
arch
opening
upon
the
crowded
bazaar
we
descend
a
few
steps
to
the
marble
pavement
of
a
lofty
octagonal
hall
lighted
by
a
dome
there
is
a
jet
of
sparkling
water
in
the
centre
falling
into
a
heavy
stone
basin
a
platform
about
five
feet
in
height
runs
around
the
hall
and
on
this
are
ranged
a
number
of
narrow
couches
with
their
heads
to
the
wall
like
the
pallets
in
a
hospital
ward
the
platform
is
covered
with
straw
matting
and
from
the
wooden
gallery
which
rises
above
it
are
suspended
towels
with
blue
and
crimson
borders
the
master
of
the
bath
receives
us
courteously
and
conducts
us
to
one
of
the
vacant
couches
we
kick
off
our
red
slippers
below
and
mount
the
steps
to
the
platform
yonder
traveller
in
frank
dress
who
has
just
entered
goes
up
with
his
boots
on
and
we
know
from
that
fact
what
sort
of
a
bath
he
will
get
as
the
work
of
disrobing
proceeds
a
boy
appears
with
a
napkin
which
he
holds
before
us
ready
to
bind
it
about
the
waist
as
soon
as
we
regain
our
primitive
form
another
attendant
throws
a
napkin
over
our
shoulders
and
wraps
a
third
around
our
head
he
then
thrusts
a
pair
of
wooden
clogs
upon
our
feet
and
taking
us
by
the
arm
steadies
our
tottering
and
clattering
steps
as
we
pass
through
a
low
door
and
a
warm
into
the
first
hall
of
the
bath
the
light
falling
dimly
through
a
cluster
of
in
the
domed
ceiling
shows
first
a
silver
thread
of
water
playing
in
a
steamy
atmosphere
next
some
dark
motionless
objects
stretched
out
on
a
low
central
platform
of
marble
the
attendant
spreads
a
linen
sheet
in
one
of
the
vacant
places
places
a
pillow
at
one
end
takes
off
our
clogs
deposits
us
gently
on
our
back
and
leaves
us
the
pavement
is
warm
beneath
us
and
the
first
breath
we
draw
gives
us
a
sense
of
suffocation
but
a
bit
of
burning
has
just
been
carried
through
the
hall
and
the
steam
is
permeated
with
fragrance
the
boy
appears
with
a
narghileh
which
he
places
beside
us
offering
the
amber
to
our
submissive
lips
the
smoke
we
inhale
has
an
odor
of
roses
and
as
the
pipe
bubbles
with
our
breathing
we
feel
that
the
dews
of
sweat
gather
heavily
upon
us
the
attendant
now
reappears
kneels
beside
us
and
gently
kneads
us
with
dexterous
hands
although
no
anatomist
he
knows
every
muscle
and
sinew
whose
suppleness
gives
ease
to
the
body
and
so
moulds
and
manipulates
them
that
we
lose
the
rigidity
of
our
mechanism
and
become
plastic
in
his
hands
he
turns
us
upon
our
face
repeats
the
same
process
upon
the
back
and
leaves
us
a
little
longer
to
lie
there
passively
glistening
in
our
own
dew
we
are
aroused
from
a
reverie
about
nothing
by
a
shape
who
replaces
the
clogs
puts
his
arm
around
our
waist
and
leads
us
into
an
inner
hall
with
a
steaming
tank
in
the
centre
here
he
slips
us
off
the
brink
and
we
collapse
over
head
and
ears
in
the
fiery
fluid
once
twice
we
dip
into
the
delicious
heat
and
then
are
led
into
a
marble
alcove
and
seated
flat
upon
the
floor
the
attendant
stands
behind
us
and
we
now
perceive
that
his
hands
are
encased
in
dark
he
pounces
upon
an
arm
which
he
rubs
until
like
a
serpent
we
slough
the
skin
and
resume
our
infantile
smoothness
and
fairness
no
man
can
be
called
clean
until
he
has
bathed
in
the
east
let
him
walk
directly
from
his
accustomed
bath
and
with
towels
to
the
hammam
and
the
attendant
will
exclaim
as
he
shakes
out
his
o
frank
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
have
bathed
the
other
arm
follows
the
back
the
breast
the
legs
until
the
work
is
complete
and
we
know
precisely
how
a
horse
feels
after
he
has
been
curried
now
the
attendant
turns
two
cocks
at
the
back
of
the
alcove
and
holding
a
basin
alternately
under
the
cold
and
hot
streams
floods
us
at
first
with
a
fiery
dash
that
sends
a
delicious
warm
shiver
through
every
nerve
then
with
milder
applications
lessening
the
temperature
of
the
water
by
until
from
the
highest
key
of
heat
which
we
can
bear
we
glide
rapturously
down
the
gamut
until
we
reach
the
lowest
bass
of
coolness
the
skin
has
by
this
time
attained
an
exquisite
sensibility
and
answers
to
these
changes
of
temperature
with
thrills
of
the
purest
physical
pleasure
in
fact
the
whole
frame
seems
purged
of
its
earthy
nature
and
transformed
into
something
of
a
finer
and
more
delicate
texture
after
a
pause
the
attendant
makes
his
appearance
with
a
large
wooden
bowl
a
piece
of
soap
and
a
bunch
of
he
squats
down
beside
the
bowl
and
speedily
creates
a
mass
of
snowy
lather
which
grows
up
to
a
pyramid
and
topples
over
the
edge
seizing
us
by
the
of
hair
upon
our
shaven
head
he
plants
the
foamy
bunch
of
fibres
full
in
our
face
the
world
vanishes
sight
hearing
smell
taste
unless
we
open
our
mouth
and
breathing
are
cut
off
we
have
become
nebulous
although
our
eyes
are
shut
we
seem
to
see
a
blank
whiteness
and
feeling
nothing
but
a
soft
fleeciness
we
doubt
whether
we
be
not
the
olympian
cloud
which
visited
lo
but
the
cloud
clears
away
before
strangulation
begins
and
the
velvety
mass
descends
upon
the
body
twice
we
are
thus
slushed
from
head
to
foot
and
made
more
slippery
than
the
anointed
wrestlers
of
the
greek
games
then
the
basin
comes
again
into
play
and
we
glide
once
more
musically
through
the
scale
of
temperature
the
brown
sculptor
has
now
nearly
completed
his
task
the
figure
of
clay
which
entered
the
bath
is
transformed
into
polished
marble
he
turns
the
body
from
side
to
side
and
lifts
the
limbs
to
see
whether
the
workmanship
is
adequate
to
his
conception
his
satisfied
gaze
proclaims
his
success
a
skilful
has
a
certain
aesthetic
pleasure
in
his
occupation
the
bodies
he
polishes
become
to
some
extent
his
own
workmanship
and
he
feels
responsible
for
their
symmetry
or
deformity
he
experiences
a
degree
of
triumph
in
contemplating
a
beautiful
form
which
has
grown
more
airily
light
and
beautiful
under
his
hands
he
is
a
great
connoisseur
of
bodies
and
could
pick
you
out
the
finest
specimens
with
as
ready
an
eye
as
an
artist
i
envy
those
old
greek
bathers
into
whose
hands
were
delivered
pericles
and
alcibiades
and
the
perfect
models
of
phidias
they
had
daily
before
their
eyes
the
highest
types
of
beauty
which
the
world
has
ever
produced
for
of
all
things
that
are
beautiful
the
human
body
is
the
crown
now
since
the
delusion
of
artists
has
been
overthrown
and
we
know
that
grecian
art
is
but
the
simple
reflex
of
nature
that
the
old
masterpieces
of
sculpture
were
no
miraculous
embodiments
of
a
but
copies
of
living
forms
we
must
admit
that
in
no
other
age
of
the
world
has
the
physical
man
been
so
perfectly
developed
the
nearest
approach
i
have
ever
seen
to
the
symmetry
of
ancient
sculpture
was
among
the
arab
tribes
of
ethiopia
our
saxon
race
can
supply
the
athlete
but
not
the
apollo
oriental
life
is
too
full
of
repose
and
the
ottoman
race
has
become
too
degenerate
through
indulgence
to
exhibit
many
striking
specimens
of
physical
beauty
the
face
is
generally
fine
but
the
body
is
apt
to
be
lank
and
with
imperfect
muscular
development
the
best
forms
i
saw
in
the
baths
were
those
of
laborers
who
with
a
good
deal
of
rugged
strength
showed
some
grace
and
harmony
of
proportion
it
may
be
received
as
a
general
rule
that
the
physical
development
of
the
european
is
superior
to
that
of
the
oriental
with
the
exception
of
the
circassians
and
georgians
whose
beauty
well
entitles
them
to
the
distinction
of
giving
their
name
to
our
race
so
far
as
female
beauty
is
concerned
the
circassian
women
have
no
superiors
they
have
preserved
in
their
mountain
home
the
purity
of
the
grecian
models
and
still
display
the
perfect
physical
loveliness
whose
type
has
descended
to
us
in
the
venus
de
medici
the
frank
who
is
addicted
to
wandering
about
the
streets
of
oriental
cities
can
hardly
fail
to
be
favored
with
a
sight
of
the
faces
of
these
beauties
more
than
once
it
has
happened
to
me
in
meeting
a
veiled
lady
sailing
along
in
her
feridjee
that
she
has
allowed
the
veil
to
drop
by
a
skilful
accident
as
she
passed
and
has
startled
me
with
the
vision
of
her
beauty
recalling
the
line
of
the
persian
poet
astonishment
is
this
the
dawn
of
the
glorious
sun
or
is
it
the
full
moon
the
circassian
face
is
a
pure
oval
the
forehead
is
low
and
fair
an
excellent
thing
in
woman
and
the
skin
of
an
ivory
whiteness
except
the
faint
pink
of
the
cheeks
and
the
ripe
roseate
stain
of
the
lips
the
hair
is
dark
glossy
and
luxuriant
exquisitely
outlined
on
the
temples
the
eyebrows
slightly
arched
and
drawn
with
a
delicate
pencil
while
lashes
like
rays
of
darkness
shade
the
large
dark
humid
orbs
below
them
the
alabaster
of
the
face
so
pure
as
scarcely
to
show
the
blue
branching
of
the
veins
on
the
temples
is
lighted
by
those
superb
eyes
shining
eyes
like
antique
jewels
set
in
parian
whose
wells
are
so
dark
and
deep
that
you
are
cheated
into
the
belief
that
a
glorious
soul
looks
out
of
them
once
by
an
unforeseen
chance
i
beheld
the
circassian
form
in
its
most
perfect
development
i
was
on
board
an
austrian
steamer
in
the
harbor
of
smyrna
when
the
harem
of
a
turkish
pasha
came
out
in
a
boat
to
embark
for
alexandria
the
sea
was
rather
rough
and
nearly
all
the
officers
of
the
steamer
were
ashore
there
were
six
veiled
and
swaddled
women
with
a
black
eunuch
as
guard
in
the
boat
which
lay
tossing
for
some
time
at
the
foot
of
the
gangway
ladder
before
the
frightened
passengers
could
summon
courage
to
step
out
at
last
the
youngest
of
them
a
circassian
girl
of
not
more
than
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
age
ventured
upon
the
ladder
clasping
the
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
she
held
together
the
folds
of
her
cumbrous
feridjee
i
was
standing
in
the
gangway
watching
her
when
a
slight
lurch
of
the
steamer
caused
her
to
loose
her
hold
of
the
garment
which
fastened
at
the
neck
was
blown
back
from
her
shoulders
leaving
her
body
screened
but
by
a
single
robe
gauzy
silk
through
this
the
marble
whiteness
of
her
skin
the
roundness
the
glorious
symmetry
of
her
form
flashed
upon
me
as
a
vision
of
aphrodite
seen
through
leagues
of
shimmering
water
like
a
star
it
was
but
a
momentary
glimpse
yet
that
moment
convinced
me
that
forms
of
phidian
perfection
are
still
nurtured
in
the
vales
of
caucasus
the
necessary
disguise
of
dress
hides
from
us
much
of
the
beauty
and
dignity
of
humanity
i
have
seen
men
who
appeared
heroic
in
the
freedom
of
nakedness
shrink
almost
into
absolute
vulgarity
when
clothed
the
soul
not
only
sits
at
the
windows
of
the
eyes
and
hangs
upon
the
gateway
of
the
lips
she
speaks
as
well
in
the
intricate
yet
harmonious
lines
of
the
body
and
the
play
of
the
limbs
look
at
the
torso
of
ilioneus
the
son
of
niobe
and
see
what
an
agony
of
terror
and
supplication
cries
out
from
that
headless
and
limbless
trunk
decapitate
laocoön
and
his
knotted
muscles
will
still
express
the
same
dreadful
suffering
and
resistance
none
knew
this
better
than
the
ancient
sculptors
and
hence
it
was
that
we
find
many
of
their
statues
of
distinguished
men
wholly
or
partly
undraped
such
a
view
of
art
would
be
considered
transcendental
when
our
dress
our
costumes
and
our
modes
of
speech
either
ignore
the
existence
of
our
bodies
or
treat
them
with
little
of
that
reverence
which
is
their
due
but
while
we
have
been
thinking
these
thoughts
the
attendant
has
been
waiting
to
give
us
a
final
plunge
into
the
seething
tank
again
we
slide
down
to
the
eyes
in
the
fluid
heat
which
wraps
us
closely
about
until
we
tingle
with
exquisite
hot
shiverings
now
comes
the
graceful
boy
with
clean
cool
lavendered
napkins
which
he
folds
around
our
waist
and
wraps
softly
about
the
head
the
pattens
are
put
upon
our
feet
and
the
brown
arm
steadies
us
gently
through
the
and
into
the
outer
hall
where
we
mount
to
our
couch
we
sink
gently
upon
the
cool
linen
and
the
boy
covers
us
with
a
perfumed
sheet
then
kneeling
beside
the
couch
he
presses
the
folds
of
the
sheet
around
us
that
it
may
absorb
the
lingering
moisture
and
the
limpid
perspiration
shed
by
the
departing
heat
as
fast
as
the
linen
becomes
damp
he
replaces
it
with
fresh
pressing
the
folds
about
us
as
tenderly
as
a
mother
arranges
the
drapery
of
her
sleeping
babe
for
we
though
of
the
stature
of
a
man
are
now
infantile
in
our
helpless
happiness
then
he
takes
our
passive
hand
and
warms
its
palm
by
the
soft
friction
of
his
own
after
which
moving
to
the
end
of
the
couch
he
lifts
our
feet
upon
his
lap
and
repeats
the
friction
upon
their
soles
until
the
blood
comes
back
to
the
surface
of
the
body
with
a
misty
glow
like
that
which
steeps
the
clouds
of
a
summer
afternoon
we
have
but
one
more
process
to
undergo
and
the
attendant
already
stands
at
the
head
of
our
couch
this
is
the
course
of
passive
gymnastics
which
excites
so
much
alarm
and
resistance
in
the
ignorant
franks
it
is
only
resistance
that
is
dangerous
completely
neutralizing
the
enjoyment
of
the
process
give
yourself
with
a
blind
submission
into
the
arms
of
the
brown
fate
and
he
will
lead
you
to
new
chambers
of
delight
he
lifts
us
to
a
sitting
posture
places
himself
behind
us
and
folds
his
arms
around
our
body
alternately
tightening
and
relaxing
his
clasp
as
if
to
test
the
elasticity
of
the
ribs
then
seizing
one
arm
he
draws
it
across
the
opposite
shoulder
until
the
joint
cracks
like
a
the
the
elbows
the
wrists
and
the
are
all
made
to
fire
off
their
muffled
volleys
and
then
placing
one
knee
between
our
shoulders
and
clasping
both
hands
upon
our
forehead
he
draws
our
head
back
until
we
feel
a
great
snap
of
the
vertebral
column
now
he
descends
to
the
knees
ankles
and
feet
forcing
each
and
all
to
discharge
a
salvo
the
slight
languor
left
from
the
bath
is
gone
and
an
airy
delicate
exhilaration
befitting
the
winged
mercury
takes
its
place
the
boy
kneeling
presents
us
with
of
foamy
coffee
followed
by
a
glass
of
sherbet
cooled
with
the
snows
of
lebanon
he
presently
returns
with
a
narghileh
which
we
smoke
by
the
effortless
inhalation
of
the
lungs
thus
we
lie
in
perfect
repose
soothed
by
the
fragrant
weed
and
idly
watching
the
silent
orientals
who
are
undressing
for
the
bath
or
reposing
like
ourselves
through
the
arched
entrance
we
see
a
picture
of
the
bazaars
a
shadowy
painting
of
merchants
seated
amid
their
silks
and
spices
dotted
here
and
there
with
golden
drops
and
splashes
of
sunshine
which
have
trickled
through
the
roof
the
scene
paints
itself
upon
our
eyes
yet
wakes
no
slightest
stir
of
thought
the
brain
is
a
becalmed
sea
without
a
ripple
on
its
shores
mind
and
body
are
drowned
in
delicious
rest
and
we
no
longer
remember
what
we
are
we
only
know
that
there
is
an
existence
somewhere
in
the
air
and
that
wherever
it
is
and
whatever
it
may
be
it
is
happy
more
and
more
dim
grows
the
picture
the
colors
fade
and
blend
into
each
other
and
finally
merge
into
a
bed
of
rosy
clouds
flooded
with
the
radiance
of
some
unseen
sun
gentlier
than
tired
eyelids
upon
tired
eyes
sleep
lies
upon
our
senses
a
sleep
wherein
we
know
that
we
behold
light
and
inhale
fragrance
as
gently
the
clouds
dissipate
into
air
and
we
are
born
again
into
the
world
the
bath
is
at
an
end
we
arise
and
put
on
our
garments
and
walk
forth
into
the
sunny
streets
of
damascus
but
as
we
go
homewards
we
involuntarily
look
down
to
see
whether
we
are
really
treading
upon
the
earth
wondering
perhaps
that
we
should
be
content
to
do
so
when
it
would
be
so
easy
to
soar

again

loaded

and
mounted

there
were

an

and
a

that

there
is
always
a
examination
not
on
entering
but
on
issuing
from
an
oriental
city
but
travellers
can
avoid
it
by
procuring
the
company
of
a
consular
janissary
as
far
as
the
gate
wood
the
british
consul
lent
us
one
of
his
officers
for
the
occasion
whom
we
found
waiting
outside
of
the
wall
to
receive
his
private
fee
for
the
service
we
mounted
the
long
barren
hill
west
of
the
plain
and
at
the
summit
near
the
tomb
of
a
moslem
shekh
turned
to
take
a
last
long
look
at
the
bowery
plain
and
the
minarets
of
the
city
glittering
through
the
blue
morning
vapor
a
few
paces
further
on
the
rocky
road
a
different
scene
presented
itself
to
us
there
lay
to
the
westward
a
long
stretch
of
naked
yellow
mountains
basking
in
the
hot
glare
of
the
sun
and
through
the
centre
deep
down
in
the
heart
of
the
arid
landscape
a
winding
line
of
living
green
showed
the
course
of
the
barrada
we
followed
the
river
until
the
path
reached
an
impassable
gorge
which
occasioned
a
detour
of
two
or
three
hours
we
then
descended
to
the
bed
of
the
dell
where
the
vegetation
owing
to
the
radiated
heat
from
the
mountains
and
the
fertilizing
stimulus
of
the
water
below
was
even
richer
than
on
the
plain
of
damascus
the
trees
were
plethoric
with
an
overplus
of
life
the
boughs
of
the
mulberries
were
weighed
down
with
the
burden
of
the
leaves
pomegranates
were
in
a
violent
eruption
of
blossoms
and
the
foliage
of
the
fig
and
poplar
was
of
so
deep
a
hue
that
it
shone
black
in
the
sun
passing
through
a
gateway
of
rock
so
narrow
that
we
were
often
obliged
to
ride
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
we
reached
a
little
meadow
beyond
which
was
a
small
hamlet
almost
hidden
in
the
leaves
here
the
mountains
again
approached
each
other
and
from
the
side
of
that
on
the
right
hand
the
main
body
of
the
barrada
or
pharpar
gushed
forth
in
one
full
stream
the
fountain
is
nearly
double
the
volume
of
that
of
the
jordan
at
banias
and
much
more
beautiful
the
foundations
of
an
ancient
building
probably
a
temple
overhang
it
and
tall
poplars
and
sycamores
cover
it
with
impenetrable
shade
from
the
low
aperture
where
it
bursts
into
the
light
its
waters
white
with
foam
bound
away
flashing
in
the
chance
rays
of
sunshine
until
they
are
lost
to
sight
in
the
dense
dark
foliage
we
sat
an
hour
on
the
ruined
walls
listening
to
the
roar
and
rush
of
the
flood
and
enjoying
the
shade
of
the
walnuts
and
sycamores
soon
after
leaving
our
path
crossed
a
small
stream
which
comes
down
to
the
barrada
from
the
upper
valleys
of
the
and
entered
a
wild
pass
faced
with
cliffs
of
perpendicular
rock
an
old
bridge
of
one
arch
spanned
the
chasm
out
of
which
we
climbed
to
a
tract
of
high
meadow
land
in
the
pass
there
were
some
fragments
of
ancient
columns
traces
of
an
aqueduct
and
inscriptions
on
the
rocks
among
which
found
the
name
of
antoninus
the
place
is
not
mentioned
in
any
book
of
travel
i
have
seen
as
it
is
not
on
the
usual
road
from
damascus
to
baalbec
as
we
were
emerging
from
the
pass
we
saw
a
company
of
twelve
armed
men
seated
in
the
grass
near
the
roadside
they
were
characters
and
eyed
us
somewhat
sharply
as
we
passed
we
greeted
them
with
the
usual
salaam
aleikoom
which
they
did
not
return
the
same
evening
as
we
encamped
at
the
village
of
zebdeni
about
three
hours
further
up
the
valley
we
were
startled
by
a
great
noise
and
outcry
with
the
firing
of
pistols
it
happened
as
we
learned
on
inquiring
the
cause
of
all
this
confusion
that
the
men
we
saw
in
the
pass
were
rebel
druses
who
were
then
lying
in
wait
for
the
shekh
of
zebdeni
whom
with
his
son
they
had
taken
captive
soon
after
we
passed
the
news
had
by
some
means
been
conveyed
to
the
village
and
a
company
of
about
two
hundred
persons
was
then
marching
out
to
the
rescue
the
noise
they
made
was
probably
to
give
the
druses
intimation
of
their
coming
and
thus
avoid
a
fight
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
the
mountaineers
of
lebanon
would
willingly
take
part
against
the
druses
who
in
fact
are
not
fighting
so
much
against
the
institution
of
the
conscription
law
as
its
abuse
the
law
ordains
that
the
conscript
shall
serve
for
five
years
but
since
its
establishment
as
i
have
been
informed
there
has
not
been
a
single
instance
of
discharge
it
amounts
therefore
to
lifelong
servitude
and
there
is
little
wonder
that
these
independent
sons
of
the
mountains
as
well
as
the
tribes
inhabiting
the
syrian
desert
should
rebel
rather
than
submit
the
next
day
we
crossed
a
pass
in
the
beyond
zebdeni
descended
a
beautiful
valley
on
the
western
side
under
a
ridge
which
was
still
dotted
with
patches
of
snow
and
after
travelling
for
some
hours
over
a
wide
barren
height
the
last
of
the
range
saw
below
us
the
plain
of
baalbec
the
grand
ridge
of
lebanon
opposite
crowned
with
glittering
fields
of
snow
shone
out
clearly
through
the
pure
air
and
the
hoary
head
of
hermon
far
in
the
south
lost
something
of
its
grandeur
by
the
comparison
though
there
is
a
divide
or
watershed
between
husbeiya
at
the
foot
of
mount
hermon
and
baalbec
whose
springs
join
the
orontes
which
flows
northward
to
antioch
the
great
natural
separation
of
the
two
chains
continues
unbroken
to
the
gulf
of
akaba
in
the
red
sea
a
little
beyond
baalbec
the
terminates
sinking
into
the
syrian
plain
while
the
lebanon
though
its
name
and
general
features
are
lost
about
twenty
miles
further
to
the
north
is
succeeded
by
other
ranges
which
though
broken
at
intervals
form
a
regular
series
connecting
with
the
taurus
in
asia
minor
on
leaving
damascus
the
demon
of
hasheesh
still
maintained
a
partial
control
over
me
i
was
weak
in
body
and
at
times
confused
in
my
perceptions
wandering
away
from
the
scenes
about
me
to
some
unknown
sphere
beyond
the
moon
but
the
healing
balm
of
my
sleep
at
zebdeni
and
the
purity
of
the
morning
air
among
the
mountains
completed
my
cure
as
i
rode
along
the
valley
with
the
towering
ridge
of
the
on
my
right
a
cloudless
heaven
above
my
head
and
meads
enamelled
with
the
asphodel
and
scarlet
anemone
stretching
before
me
i
felt
that
the
last
shadow
had
rolled
away
from
my
brain
my
mind
was
now
as
clear
as
that
sky
my
heart
as
free
and
joyful
as
the
elastic
morning
air
the
sun
never
shone
so
brightly
to
my
eyes
the
fair
forms
of
nature
were
never
penetrated
with
so
perfect
a
spirit
of
beauty
i
was
again
master
of
myself
and
the
world
glowed
as
if
in
the
light
of
my
joy
and
gratitude
i
thanked
god
who
had
led
me
out
of
a
darkness
more
terrible
than
that
of
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
while
my
feet
strayed
among
the
flowery
meadows
of
lebanon
my
heart
walked
on
the
delectable
hills
of
his
mercy
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
reached
baalbec
the
distant
view
of
the
temple
on
descending
the
last
slope
of
the
is
not
calculated
to
raise
one
expectations
on
the
green
plain
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
you
see
a
large
square
platform
of
masonry
upon
which
stand
six
columns
the
body
of
the
temple
and
a
quantity
of
ruined
walls
as
a
feature
in
the
landscape
it
has
a
fine
effect
but
you
find
yourself
pronouncing
the
speedy
judgment
that
baalbec
without
lebanon
would
be
rather
a
poor
show
having
come
to
this
conclusion
you
ride
down
the
hill
with
comfortable
feelings
of
indifference
there
are
a
number
of
quarries
on
the
left
hand
you
glance
at
them
with
an
expression
which
merely
says
ah
i
suppose
they
got
the
stones
here
and
so
you
saunter
on
cross
a
little
stream
that
flows
down
from
the
modern
village
pass
a
mill
return
the
stare
of
the
quaint
arab
miller
who
comes
to
the
door
to
see
you
and
your
horse
is
climbing
a
difficult
path
among
the
broken
columns
and
friezes
before
you
think
it
worth
while
to
lift
your
eyes
to
the
pile
above
you
now
your
judgment
if
you
dare
this
is
baalbec
what
have
you
to
say
nothing
but
you
amazedly
measure
the
torsos
of
great
columns
which
lie
piled
across
one
another
in
magnificent
wreck
vast
pieces
which
have
dropped
from
the
entablature
beautiful
corinthian
capitals
bereft
of
the
last
graceful
curves
of
their
acanthus
leaves
and
blocks
whose
edges
are
so
worn
away
that
they
resemble
enormous
natural
boulders
left
by
the
deluge
till
at
last
you
look
up
to
the
six
glorious
pillars
towering
nigh
a
hundred
feet
above
your
head
and
there
is
a
sensation
in
your
brain
which
would
be
a
shout
if
you
could
give
it
utterance
of
faultless
symmetry
and
majesty
such
as
no
conception
of
yours
and
no
other
creation
of
art
can
surpass
i
know
of
nothing
so
beautiful
in
all
remains
of
ancient
art
as
these
six
columns
except
the
colonnade
of
the
memnonium
at
thebes
which
is
of
much
smaller
proportions
from
every
position
and
with
all
lights
of
the
day
or
night
they
are
equally
perfect
and
carry
your
eyes
continually
away
from
the
peristyle
of
the
smaller
temple
which
is
better
preserved
and
from
the
exquisite
architecture
of
the
outer
courts
and
pavilions
the
two
temples
of
baalbec
stand
on
an
artificial
platform
of
masonry
a
thousand
feet
in
length
and
from
fifteen
to
thirty
feet
according
to
the
depression
of
the
soil
in
height
the
larger
one
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
a
pantheon
occupies
the
whole
length
of
this
platform
the
entrance
was
at
the
north
by
a
grand
flight
of
steps
now
broken
away
between
two
lofty
and
elegant
pavilions
which
are
still
nearly
entire
then
followed
a
spacious
hexagonal
court
and
three
grand
halls
parts
of
which
with
niches
for
statues
adorned
with
cornices
and
pediments
of
elaborate
design
still
remain
entire
to
the
roof
this
magnificent
series
of
chambers
was
terminated
at
the
southern
extremity
of
the
platform
by
the
main
temple
which
had
originally
twenty
columns
on
a
side
similar
to
the
six
now
standing
the
temple
of
the
sun
stands
on
a
smaller
and
lower
platform
which
appears
to
have
been
subsequently
added
to
the
greater
one
the
cella
or
body
of
the
temple
is
complete
except
the
roof
and
of
the
colonnade
surrounding
it
nearly
of
its
pillars
are
still
standing
upholding
the
frieze
entablature
and
cornice
which
altogether
form
probably
the
most
ornate
specimen
of
the
corinthian
order
of
architecture
now
extant
only
four
pillars
of
the
superb
portico
remain
and
the
saracens
have
nearly
ruined
these
by
building
a
sort
of
upon
the
architrave
the
same
unscrupulous
race
completely
shut
up
the
portal
of
the
temple
with
a
blank
wall
formed
of
the
fragments
they
had
hurled
down
and
one
is
obliged
to
creep
through
a
narrow
hole
in
order
to
reach
the
interior
here
the
original
doorway
faces
you
and
i
know
not
how
to
describe
the
wonderful
design
of
its
elaborate
sculptured
mouldings
and
cornices
the
genius
of
greek
art
seems
to
have
exhausted
itself
in
inventing
ornaments
which
while
they
should
heighten
the
gorgeous
effect
of
the
work
must
yet
harmonize
with
the
grand
design
of
the
temple
the
enormous
keystone
over
the
entrance
has
slipped
down
no
doubt
from
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
and
hangs
within
six
inches
of
the
bottom
of
the
two
blocks
which
uphold
it
on
either
side
when
it
falls
the
whole
entablature
of
the
portal
will
be
destroyed
on
its
lower
side
is
an
eagle
with
outspread
wings
and
on
the
a
genius
with
garlands
of
flowers
exquisitely
sculptured
in
bas
relief
hidden
among
the
wreaths
of
vines
which
adorn
the
jambs
are
the
laughing
heads
of
fauns
this
portal
was
a
continual
study
to
me
every
visit
revealing
new
refinements
of
ornament
which
i
had
not
before
observed
the
interior
of
the
temple
with
its
rich
corinthian
pilasters
its
niches
for
statues
surmounted
by
pediments
of
elegant
design
and
its
elaborate
cornice
needs
little
aid
of
the
imagination
to
restore
it
to
its
original
perfection
like
that
of
dendera
in
egypt
the
temple
of
the
sun
leaves
upon
the
mind
an
impression
of
completeness
which
makes
you
forget
far
grander
remains
but
the
most
wonderful
thing
at
baalbec
is
the
foundation
platform
upon
which
the
temples
stand
even
the
colossal
fabrics
of
ancient
egypt
dwindle
before
this
superhuman
masonry
the
platform
itself
feet
long
and
averaging
twenty
feet
in
height
suggests
a
vast
mass
of
stones
but
when
you
come
to
examine
the
single
blocks
of
which
it
is
composed
you
are
crushed
with
their
incredible
bulk
on
the
western
side
is
a
row
of
eleven
foundation
stones
each
of
which
is
feet
in
length
twelve
in
height
and
ten
in
thickness
forming
a
wall
three
hundred
and
feet
long
but
while
you
are
walking
on
thinking
of
the
art
which
cut
and
raised
these
enormous
blocks
you
turn
the
southern
corner
and
come
upon
stones
the
united
length
of
which
is
hundred
and
two
of
them
being
and
the
other
feet
in
length
there
they
are
cut
with
faultless
exactness
and
so
smoothly
joined
to
each
other
that
you
can
not
force
a
cambric
needle
into
the
crevice
there
is
one
joint
so
perfect
that
it
can
only
be
discerned
by
the
minutest
search
it
is
not
even
so
perceptible
as
the
junction
of
two
pieces
of
paper
which
have
been
pasted
together
in
the
quarry
there
still
lies
a
finished
block
ready
for
transportation
which
is
feet
in
length
the
weight
of
one
of
these
masses
has
been
reckoned
at
near
tons
yet
they
do
not
form
the
base
of
the
foundation
but
are
raised
upon
other
courses
fifteen
feet
from
the
ground
it
is
considered
by
some
antiquarians
that
they
are
of
a
date
greatly
anterior
to
that
of
the
temples
and
were
intended
as
the
basement
of
a
different
edifice
in
the
village
of
baalbec
there
is
a
small
circular
corinthian
temple
of
very
elegant
design
it
is
not
more
than
thirty
feet
in
diameter
and
may
have
been
intended
as
a
tomb
a
spacious
mosque
now
roofless
and
deserted
was
constructed
almost
entirely
out
of
the
remains
of
the
temples
adjoining
the
and
fountain
are
five
rows
of
ancient
pillars
forty
the
sacred
number
in
all
supporting
light
saracenic
arches
some
of
them
are
marble
with
corinthian
capitals
and
eighteen
are
single
shafts
of
red
egyptian
granite
beside
the
fountain
lies
a
small
broken
pillar
of
porphyry
of
a
dark
violet
hue
and
of
so
fine
a
grain
that
the
stone
has
the
soft
rich
lustre
of
velvet
this
fragment
is
the
only
thing
i
would
carry
away
if
i
had
the
power
after
a
day
sojourn
we
left
baalbec
at
noon
and
took
the
road
for
the
cedars
which
lie
on
the
other
side
of
lebanon
in
the
direction
of
tripoli
our
english
chose
the
direct
road
to
beyrout
we
crossed
the
plain
in
three
hours
to
the
village
of
dayr
and
then
commenced
ascending
the
lowest
slopes
of
the
great
range
whose
topmost
ridge
a
dazzling
parapet
of
snow
rose
high
above
us
for
several
hours
our
path
led
up
and
down
stony
ridges
covered
with
thickets
of
oak
and
holly
and
with
wild
cherry
pear
and
just
as
the
sun
threw
the
shadows
of
the
highest
lebanon
over
us
we
came
upon
a
narrow
rocky
glen
at
his
very
base
streams
that
still
kept
the
color
and
the
coolness
of
the
from
which
they
oozed
foamed
over
the
stones
into
the
chasm
at
the
bottom
the
glen
descended
into
a
mountain
basin
in
which
lay
the
lake
of
yemouni
cold
and
green
under
the
evening
shadows
but
just
opposite
us
on
a
little
shelf
of
soil
there
was
a
rude
mill
and
a
group
of
superb
overhanging
the
brink
of
the
largest
torrent
we
had
sent
our
baggage
before
us
and
the
men
with
an
eye
to
the
picturesque
which
i
should
not
have
suspected
in
arabs
had
pitched
our
tents
under
those
trees
where
the
stream
poured
its
beakers
beside
us
and
the
looked
down
on
the
plain
of
baalbec
and
across
to
the
the
miller
and
two
or
three
peasants
who
were
living
in
this
lonely
spot
were
christians
the
next
morning
we
commenced
ascending
the
lebanon
we
had
slept
just
below
the
for
the
long
hollows
with
which
the
ridge
is
cloven
were
filled
up
to
within
a
short
distance
of
the
glen
out
of
which
we
came
the
path
was
very
steep
continually
ascending
now
around
the
barren
shoulder
of
the
mountain
now
up
some
ravine
where
the
holly
and
olive
still
flourished
and
the
wild
spread
its
large
succulent
leaves
over
the
soil
we
had
taken
a
guide
the
day
before
at
the
village
of
dayr
but
as
the
way
was
plain
before
us
and
he
demanded
an
exorbitant
sum
we
dismissed
him
we
had
not
climbed
far
however
before
he
returned
professing
to
be
content
with
whatever
we
might
give
him
and
took
us
into
another
road
the
first
he
said
being
impracticable
up
and
up
we
toiled
and
the
long
hollows
of
snow
lay
below
us
and
the
wind
came
cold
from
the
topmost
peaks
which
began
to
show
near
at
hand
but
now
the
road
as
we
had
surmised
turned
towards
that
we
had
first
taken
and
on
reaching
the
next
height
we
saw
the
latter
at
a
short
distance
from
us
it
was
not
only
a
better
but
a
shorter
road
the
rascal
of
a
guide
having
led
us
out
of
it
in
order
to
give
the
greater
effect
to
his
services
in
order
to
return
to
it
as
was
necessary
there
were
several
dangerous
to
be
passed
the
angle
of
their
descent
was
so
great
that
a
single
false
step
would
have
hurled
our
animals
baggage
and
all
many
hundred
feet
below
the
snow
was
melting
and
the
crust
frozen
over
the
streams
below
was
so
thin
in
places
that
the
animals
broke
through
and
sank
to
their
bellies
it
were
needless
to
state
the
number
and
character
of
the
anathemas
bestowed
upon
the
guide
the
impassive
dervish
raved
mustapha
stormed
françois
broke
out
in
a
frightful
eruption
of
greek
and
turkish
oaths
and
the
two
travellers
though
not
as
i
hope
and
believe
profanely
inclined
could
not
avoid
using
a
few
terse
saxon
expressions
when
the
general
indignation
had
found
vent
the
men
went
to
work
and
by
taking
each
animal
separately
succeeded
at
imminent
hazard
in
getting
them
all
over
the
snow
we
then
dismissed
the
guide
who
far
from
being
abashed
by
the
discovery
of
his
trickery
had
the
impudence
to
follow
us
for
some
time
claiming
his
pay
a
few
more
steep
pulls
over
deep
beds
of
snow
and
patches
of
barren
stone
and
at
length
the
summit
ridge
a
sharp
white
wall
shining
against
the
intense
of
the
zenith
stood
before
us
we
climbed
a
toilsome
through
the
snow
hurried
over
the
stones
cumbering
the
top
and
all
at
once
the
mountains
fell
away
ridge
below
ridge
gashed
with
tremendous
chasms
whose
bottoms
were
lost
in
blue
vapor
till
the
last
heights
crowned
with
white
maronite
convents
hung
above
the
sea
whose
misty
round
bounded
the
vision
i
have
seen
many
grander
mountain
views
but
few
so
sublimely
rugged
and
broken
in
their
features
the
sides
of
the
ridges
dropped
off
in
all
directions
into
sheer
precipices
and
the
few
villages
we
could
see
were
built
like
nests
on
the
brinks
in
a
little
hollow
at
our
feet
was
the
sacred
forest
of
cedars
appearing
like
a
patch
of
stunted
junipers
it
is
the
highest
speck
of
vegetation
on
lebanon
and
in
winter
can
not
be
visited
on
account
of
the
snow
the
summit
on
which
we
stood
was
about
nine
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
but
there
were
peaks
on
each
side
at
least
a
thousand
feet
higher
we
descended
by
a
very
steep
path
over
occasional
beds
of
snow
and
reached
the
cedars
in
an
hour
and
a
half
not
until
we
were
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
trees
and
below
their
level
was
i
at
all
impressed
with
their
size
and
venerable
aspect
but
once
entered
into
the
heart
of
the
little
wood
walking
over
its
miniature
hills
and
valleys
and
breathing
the
pure
balsamic
exhalations
of
the
trees
all
the
disappointment
rising
to
my
mind
was
charmed
away
in
an
instant
there
are
about
three
hundred
trees
in
all
many
of
which
are
of
the
last
growth
but
at
least
fifty
of
them
would
be
considered
grand
in
any
forest
the
patriarchs
are
five
in
number
and
are
undoubtedly
as
old
as
the
christian
era
if
not
the
age
of
solomon
the
cypresses
in
the
garden
of
montezuma
at
chapultepec
are
even
older
and
grander
trees
but
they
are
as
entire
and
shapely
as
ever
whereas
these
are
gnarled
and
twisted
into
wonderful
forms
by
the
storms
of
twenty
centuries
and
shivered
in
some
places
by
lightning
the
hoary
father
of
them
all
nine
feet
in
diameter
stands
in
the
centre
of
the
grove
on
a
little
knoll
and
spreads
his
ponderous
arms
each
a
tree
in
itself
over
the
heads
of
the
many
generations
that
have
grown
up
below
as
if
giving
his
last
benediction
before
decay
he
is
scarred
less
with
storm
and
lightning
than
with
the
knives
of
travellers
and
the
marble
crags
of
lebanon
do
not
more
firmly
retain
their
inscriptions
than
his
stony
trunk
dates
of
the
last
century
are
abundant
and
i
recollect
a
tablet
inscribed
souard
around
which
the
newer
wood
has
grown
to
the
height
of
three
or
four
inches
the
seclusion
of
the
grove
shut
in
by
peaks
of
barren
snow
is
complete
only
the
voice
of
the
nightingale
singing
here
by
daylight
in
the
solemn
shadows
breaks
the
silence
the
maronite
monk
who
has
charge
of
a
little
stone
chapel
standing
in
the
midst
moves
about
like
a
shade
and
not
before
you
are
ready
to
leave
brings
his
book
for
you
to
register
your
name
therein
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
few
of
the
crowd
that
annually
overrun
syria
reach
the
cedars
which
after
baalbec
are
the
finest
remains
of
antiquity
in
the
whole
country
after
a
stay
of
three
hours
we
rode
on
to
eden
whither
our
men
had
already
gone
with
the
baggage
our
road
led
along
the
brink
of
a
tremendous
gorge
a
thousand
feet
deep
the
bottom
of
which
was
only
accessible
here
and
there
by
hazardous
on
either
side
a
long
shelf
of
cultivated
land
sloped
down
to
the
top
and
the
mountain
streams
after
watering
a
multitude
of
orchards
and
tumbled
over
the
cliffs
in
long
sparkling
cascades
to
join
the
roaring
flood
below
this
is
the
christian
region
of
lebanon
inhabited
almost
wholly
by
maronites
who
still
retain
a
portion
of
their
former
independence
and
are
the
most
thrifty
industrious
honest
and
happy
people
in
syria
their
villages
are
not
concrete
masses
of
picturesque
filth
as
are
those
of
the
moslems
but
are
loosely
scattered
among
orchards
of
mulberry
poplar
and
vine
washed
by
fresh
rills
and
have
an
air
of
comparative
neatness
and
comfort
each
has
its
two
or
three
chapels
with
their
little
belfries
which
toll
the
hours
of
prayer
sad
and
poetic
as
is
the
call
from
the
minaret
it
never
touched
me
as
when
i
heard
the
sweet
tongues
of
those
christian
bells
chiming
vespers
far
and
near
on
the
sides
of
lebanon
eden
merits
its
name
it
is
a
mountain
paradise
inhabited
by
people
so
kind
and
that
assuredly
no
vengeful
angel
will
ever
drive
them
out
with
his
flaming
sword
it
hangs
above
the
gorge
which
is
here
nearly
two
thousand
feet
deep
and
overlooks
a
grand
wilderness
of
crowded
on
and
over
each
other
from
the
sea
that
gleams
below
to
the
topmost
heights
that
keep
off
the
morning
sun
the
houses
are
all
built
of
hewn
stone
and
grouped
in
clusters
under
the
shade
of
large
in
walking
among
them
we
received
kind
greetings
everywhere
and
every
one
who
was
seated
rose
and
remained
standing
as
we
passed
the
women
are
beautiful
with
sprightly
intelligent
faces
quite
different
from
the
stupid
mahometan
females
the
children
were
charming
creatures
and
some
of
the
girls
of
ten
or
twelve
years
were
lovely
as
angels
they
came
timidly
to
our
tent
which
the
men
had
pitched
as
before
under
two
superb
trees
beside
a
fountain
and
offered
us
roses
and
branches
of
fragrant
white
jasmine
they
expected
some
return
of
course
but
did
not
ask
it
and
the
delicate
grace
with
which
the
offering
was
made
was
beyond
all
pay
it
was
sunday
and
the
men
and
boys
having
nothing
better
to
do
all
came
to
see
and
talk
with
us
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
circle
of
gay
and
laughing
villagers
in
which
we
sat
that
evening
while
the
dark
purple
shadows
gradually
filled
up
the
gorges
and
broad
golden
lights
poured
over
the
shoulders
of
the
hills
the
men
had
much
sport
in
inducing
the
smaller
boys
to
come
up
and
salute
us
there
was
one
whom
they
called
the
consul
who
eluded
them
for
some
time
but
was
finally
caught
and
placed
in
the
ring
before
us
peace
be
with
you
o
consul
i
said
making
him
a
profound
inclination
may
your
days
be
propitious
may
your
shadow
be
increased
but
i
then
saw
from
the
vacant
expression
on
the
boy
face
that
he
was
one
of
those
harmless
witless
creatures
whom
yet
one
can
not
quite
call
idiots
he
is
an
unfortunate
he
knows
nothing
he
has
no
protector
but
god
said
the
men
crossing
themselves
devoutly
the
boy
took
off
his
cap
crept
up
and
kissed
my
hand
as
i
gave
him
some
money
which
he
no
sooner
grasped
than
he
sprang
up
like
a
startled
gazelle
and
was
out
of
sight
in
an
instant
in
descending
from
eden
to
the
we
were
obliged
to
cross
the
great
gorge
of
which
i
spoke
further
down
its
sides
are
less
steep
and
clothed
even
to
the
very
bottom
with
magnificent
orchards
of
mulberry
fig
olive
orange
and
pomegranate
trees
we
were
three
hours
in
reaching
the
opposite
side
although
the
breadth
across
the
top
is
not
more
than
a
mile
the
path
was
exceedingly
perilous
we
walked
down
leading
our
horses
and
once
were
obliged
to
unload
our
mules
to
get
them
past
a
tree
which
would
have
forced
them
off
the
brink
of
a
chasm
several
hundred
feet
deep
the
view
from
the
bottom
was
wonderful
we
were
shut
in
by
steeps
of
foliage
and
blossoms
from
two
to
three
thousand
feet
high
broken
by
crags
of
white
marble
and
towering
almost
precipitously
to
the
very
clouds
i
doubt
if
melville
saw
anything
grander
in
the
tropical
gorges
of
typee
after
reaching
the
other
side
we
had
still
a
journey
of
eight
hours
to
the
sea
through
a
wild
and
broken
yet
highly
cultivated
country
beyrout
was
now
thirteen
hours
distant
but
by
making
a
forced
march
we
reached
it
in
a
day
travelling
along
the
shore
past
the
towns
of
jebeil
the
ancient
byblus
and
joonieh
the
hills
about
jebeil
produce
the
celebrated
tobacco
known
in
egypt
as
the
or
mountain
tobacco
which
is
even
superior
to
the
latakiyeh
near
beyrout
the
mulberry
and
olive
are
in
the
ascendant
the
latter
tree
bears
the
finest
fruit
in
all
the
levant
and
might
drive
all
other
oils
out
of
the
market
if
any
one
had
enterprise
enough
to
erect
proper
manufactories
instead
of
this
the
oil
of
the
country
is
badly
prepared
rancid
from
the
skins
in
which
it
is
kept
and
the
wealthy
natives
import
from
france
and
italy
in
preference
to
using
it
in
the
bottoms
near
the
sea
i
saw
several
fields
of
the
the
cultivation
of
which
i
had
supposed
was
exclusively
confined
to
the
islands
of
the
pacific
there
would

of

unto

that

does
not
know

it
is
strange
that
our

where
the

is
unknown
should
have
given
to
the

this
great
agent
of
rest
there
is
nothing
more
remarkable
in
history
than
the
colonization
of
tobacco
over
the
whole

not
three
centuries

it
is
idle
for
those
who
object
to
the
use
of

to
attribute
these
phenomena
wholly
to
a
perverted
taste
the
fact
that
the
custom
was
at
once
adopted
by
all
the
races
of
men
whatever
their
geographical
position
and
degree
of
civilization
proves
that
there
must
be
a
reason
for
it
in
the
physical
constitution
of
man
its
effect
when
habitually
used
is
slightly
narcotic
and
sedative
not
stimulating
or
if
so
at
times
it
stimulates
only
the
imagination
and
the
social
faculties
it
lulls
to
sleep
the
combative
and
destructive
propensities
and
hence
so
far
as
a
material
agent
may
operate
it
exercises
a
humanizing
and
refining
influence
a
profound
student
of
man
whose
name
is
well
known
to
the
world
once
informed
me
that
he
saw
in
the
eagerness
with
which
savage
tribes
adopt
the
use
of
tobacco
a
spontaneous
movement
of
nature
towards
civilization
i
will
not
pursue
these
speculations
further
for
the
narghileh
bubbling
softly
at
my
elbow
as
i
write
is
the
promoter
of
repose
and
the
begetter
of
agreeable
reverie
as
i
inhale
its
cool
fragrant
breath
and
partly
yield
myself
to
the
sensation
of
healthy
rest
which
wraps
my
limbs
as
with
a
velvet
mantle
i
marvel
how
the
poets
and
artists
and
scholars
of
olden
times
nursed
those
dreams
which
the
world
calls
indolence
but
which
are
the
seeds
that
germinate
into
great
achievements
how
did
plato
philosophize
without
the
pipe
how
did
gray
homer
sitting
on
the
in
the
grecian
twilights
drive
from
his
heart
the
bitterness
of
beggary
and
blindness
how
did
phidias
charm
the
cerberus
of
his
animal
nature
to
sleep
while
his
soul
entered
the
elysian
fields
and
beheld
the
forms
of
heroes
for
in
the
higher
world
of
art
body
and
soul
are
sworn
enemies
and
the
pipe
holds
an
opiate
more
potent
than
all
the
drowsy
syrups
of
the
east
to
drug
the
former
into
submission
milton
knew
this
as
he
smoked
his
evening
pipe
at
chalfont
wandering
the
while
among
the
palms
of
paradise
but
it
is
also
our
loss
that
tobacco
was
unknown
to
the
greeks
they
would
else
have
given
us
in
verse
and
in
marble
another
divinity
in
their
glorious
pantheon
a
god
less
drowsy
than
morpheus
and
somnus
less
riotous
than
bacchus
less
radiant
than
apollo
but
with
something
of
the
spirit
of
each
a
figure
beautiful
with
youth
every
muscle
in
perfect
repose
and
the
vague
expression
of
dreams
in
his
eyes
his
temple
would
have
been
built
in
a
grove
of
southern
pines
on
the
borders
of
a
gulf
sheltered
from
the
surges
that
buffet
without
where
service
would
have
been
rendered
him
in
the
late
hours
of
the
afternoon
or
in
the
evening
twilight
from
his
oracular
tripod
words
of
wisdom
would
have
been
spoken
and
the
fanes
of
delphi
and
dodona
would
have
been
deserted
for
his
oh
friends
who
read
these
lines
with
pain
and
incredulity
and
you
ladies
who
turn
pale
at
the
thought
of
a
pipe
let
me
tell
you
that
you
are
familiar
only
with
the
vulgar
form
of
tobacco
and
have
never
passed
between
the
wind
and
its
gentility
the
word
conveys
no
idea
to
you
but
that
of
long
nines
and
and
cavendish
forget
these
for
a
moment
and
look
upon
this
cake
of
dried
leaves
and
blossoms
which
exhales
an
odor
of
pressed
flowers
these
are
the
tender
tops
of
the
plucked
as
the
buds
begin
to
expand
and
carefully
dried
in
the
shade
in
order
to
be
used
it
is
moistened
with
water
and
cut
to
the
necessary
degree
of
fineness
the
test
of
true
jebelee
is
that
it
burns
with
a
slow
hidden
fire
like
tinder
and
causes
no
irritation
to
the
eye
when
held
under
it
the
smoke
drawn
through
a
long
pipe
and
amber
is
pure
cool
and
sweet
with
an
aromatic
flavor
which
is
very
pleasant
in
the
mouth
it
excites
no
salivation
and
leaves
behind
it
no
unpleasant
stale
odor
the
narghileh
still
bubbling
beside
me
is
an
institution
known
only
in
the
east
it
requires
a
peculiar
kind
of
tobacco
which
grows
to
perfection
in
the
southern
provinces
of
persia
the
smoke
after
passing
through
water
if
you
choose
is
inhaled
through
a
long
flexible
tube
directly
into
the
lungs
it
occasions
not
the
slightest
irritation
or
oppression
but
in
a
few
minutes
produces
a
delicious
sense
of
rest
which
is
felt
even
in
the
the
pure
physical
sensation
of
rest
is
one
of
strength
also
and
of
perfect
contentment
many
an
impatient
thought
many
an
angry
word
have
i
avoided
by
a
resort
to
the
pipe
among
our
aborigines
the
pipe
was
the
emblem
of
peace
and
i
strongly
recommend
the
peace
society
to
print
their
tracts
upon
papers
of
smoking
tobacco
turkish
if
possible
and
distribute
pipes
with
them
i
know
of
nothing
more
refreshing
after
the
fatigue
of
a
long
journey
than
a
narghileh
that
slight
feverish
and
excitable
feeling
which
is
the
result
of
fatigue
yields
at
once
to
its
potency
the
blood
loses
its
heat
and
the
pulse
its
rapidity
the
muscles
relax
the
nerves
are
soothed
into
quiet
and
the
frame
passes
into
a
condition
similar
to
sleep
except
that
the
mind
is
awake
and
active
by
the
time
one
has
finished
his
pipe
he
is
refreshed
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
his
nightly
sleep
is
sound
and
healthy
such
are
some
of
the
physical
effects
of
the
pipe
in
eastern
lands
morally
and
psychologically
it
works
still
greater
transformations
but
to
describe
them
now
with
the
at
my
lips
would
require
an
active
which
the
habit
does
not
allow
a
servant
enters
with
a
steamy
cup
of
coffee
seated
in
a
silver
or
his
thumb
and
are
clasped
firmly
upon
the
bottom
of
the
zerf
which
i
inclose
near
the
top
with
my
own
thumb
and
finger
so
that
the
transfer
is
accomplished
without
his
hand
having
touched
mine
after
draining
the
thick
brown
liquid
which
must
be
done
with
due
deliberation
and
a
pause
of
satisfaction
between
each
sip
i
return
the
zerf
holding
it
in
the
middle
while
the
attendant
places
a
palm
of
each
hand
upon
the
top
and
bottom
and
carries
it
off
without
contact
the
beverage
is
made
of
the
berries
of
mocha
slightly
roasted
pulverized
in
a
mortar
and
heated
to
a
foam
without
the
addition
of
cream
or
sugar
sometimes
however
it
is
flavored
with
the
extract
of
roses
or
violets
when
skilfully
made
each
cup
is
prepared
separately
and
the
quantity
of
water
and
coffee
carefully
measured
coffee
is
a
true
child
of
the
east
and
its
original
home
was
among
the
hills
of
yemen
the
arabia
felix
of
the
ancients
fortunately
for
mussulmen
its
use
was
unknown
in
the
days
of
mahomet
or
it
would
probably
have
fallen
under
the
same
prohibition
as
wine
the
word
whence
is
an
old
arabic
term
for
wine
the
discovery
of
the
properties
of
coffee
is
attributed
to
a
dervish
who
for
some
misdemeanor
was
carried
into
the
mountains
of
yemen
by
his
brethren
and
there
left
to
perish
by
starvation
in
order
to
appease
the
pangs
of
hunger
he
gathered
the
ripe
berries
from
the
wild
roasted
and
ate
them
the
nourishment
they
contained
with
water
from
the
springs
sustained
his
life
and
after
two
or
three
months
he
returned
in
good
condition
to
his
brethren
who
considered
his
preservation
as
a
miracle
and
ever
afterwards
looked
upon
him
as
a
pattern
of
holiness
he
taught
the
use
of
the
miraculous
fruit
and
the
demand
for
it
soon
became
so
great
as
to
render
the
cultivation
of
the
tree
necessary
it
was
a
long
time
however
before
coffee
was
introduced
into
europe
as
late
as
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
sandys
the
quaint
old
traveller
describes
the
appearance
and
taste
of
the
beverage
which
he
calls
coffa
and
sagely
asks
why
not
that
black
broth
which
the
lacedemonians
used
on
account
of
the
excellence
of
the
material
and
the
skilful
manner
of
its
preparation
the
coffee
of
the
east
is
the
finest
in
the
world
i
have
found
it
so
grateful
and
refreshing
a
drink
that
i
can
readily
pardon
the
pleasant
exaggeration
of
the
arabic
poet
kader
anazari
djezeri
hanbali
the
son
of
mahomet
who
thus
celebrates
its
virtues
after
such
an
exalted
eulogy
my
own
praises
would
sound
dull
and
tame
and
i
therefore
resume
my
pipe
commending
kader
to
the
reader
o
coffee
thou
dispellest
the
cares
of
the
great
thou
bringest
back
those
who
wander
from
the
paths
of
knowledge
coffee
is
the
beverage
of
the
people
of
god
and
the
cordial
of
his
servants
who
thirst
for
wisdom
when
coffee
is
infused
into
the
bowl
it
exhales
the
odor
of
musk
and
is
of
the
color
of
ink
the
truth
is
not
known
except
to
the
wise
who
drink
it
from
the
foaming
god
has
deprived
fools
of
coffee
who
with
invincible
obstinacy
condemn
it
as
injurious
coffee
is
our
gold
and
in
the
place
of
its
libations
we
are
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
best
and
noblest
society
coffee
is
even
as
innocent
a
drink
as
the
purest
milk
from
which
it
is
distinguished
only
by
its
color
tarry
with
thy
coffee
in
the
place
of
its
preparation
and
the
good
god
will
hover
over
thee
and
participate
in
his
feast
there
the
graces
of
the
saloon
the
luxury
of
life
the
society
of
friends
all
furnish
a
picture
of
the
abode
of
happiness
every
care
vanishes
when
the
presents
the
delicious
chalice
it
will
circulate
fleetly
through
thy
veins
and
will
not
rankle
there
if
thou
doubtest
this
contemplate
the
youth
and
beauty
of
those
who
drink
it
grief
can
not
exist
where
it
grows
sorrow
humbles
itself
in
obedience
before
its
powers
coffee
is
the
drink
of
god
people
in
it
is
health
let
this
be
the
answer
to
those
who
doubt
its
qualities
in
it
we
will
drown
our
adversities
and
in
its
fire
consume
our
sorrows
whoever
has
once
seen
the
blissful
chalice
will
scorn
the
glorious
drink
thy
color
is
the
seal
of
purity
and
reason
proclaims
it
genuine
drink
with
confidence
and
regard
not
the
prattle
of
fools
who
condemn

foundation

where
and
how
far
he
shall
go
until
his
journey
is
finished
with
but
a
limited
portion
of
both
these
necessaries
i
have
so
far
carried
out
my
original
plan
with
scarcely
a
variation
but
at
present
i
am
obliged
to
make
a
material
change
of
route
my
farthest
east
is
here
at
aleppo
at
damascus
i
was
told
by
everybody
that
it
was
too
late
in
the
season
to
visit
either
baghdad
or
mosul
and
that
on
account
of
the
terrible
summer
heats
and
the
fevers
which
prevail
along
the
tigris
it
would
be
imprudent
to
undertake
it
notwithstanding
this
i
should
probably
have
gone
being
now
so
thoroughly
acclimated
that
i
have
nothing
to
fear
from
the
heat
had
i
not
met
with
a
friend
of
rawlinson
the
companion
of
layard
and
the
sharer
in
his
discoveries
at
nineveh
this
gentleman
who
met
not
long
since
in
constantinople
on
his
way
to
baghdad
where
he
resides
as
british
consul
informed
me
that
since
the
departure
of
layard
from
mosul
the
most
interesting
excavations
have
been
filled
up
in
order
to
preserve
the
sculptures
unless
one
was
able
to
make
a
new
exhumation
he
would
be
by
no
means
repaid
for
so
long
and
arduous
a
journey
the
ruins
of
nineveh
are
all
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
the
little
of
them
that
is
now
left
exposed
is
less
complete
and
interesting
than
the
specimens
in
the
british
museum
there
is
a
route
from
damascus
to
baghdad
across
the
desert
by
way
of
palmyra
but
it
is
rarely
travelled
even
by
the
natives
except
when
the
caravans
are
sufficiently
strong
to
withstand
the
attacks
of
the
bedouins
the
traveller
is
obliged
to
go
in
arab
costume
to
leave
his
baggage
behind
except
a
meagre
scrip
for
the
journey
and
to
pay
from
to
for
the
camels
and
escort
the
more
usual
route
is
to
come
northward
to
this
city
then
cross
to
mosul
and
descend
the
tigris
a
journey
of
four
or
five
weeks
after
weighing
all
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
undertaking
a
tour
of
such
length
as
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
before
reaching
constantinople
i
decided
at
beyrout
to
give
up
the
fascinating
fields
of
travel
in
media
assyria
and
armenia
and
take
a
rather
shorter
equally
interesting
route
from
aleppo
to
constantinople
by
way
of
tarsus
konia
iconium
and
the
ancient
countries
of
phrygia
bithynia
and
mysia
the
interior
of
asia
minor
is
even
less
known
to
us
than
the
persian
side
of
asiatic
turkey
which
has
of
late
received
more
attention
from
travellers
and
as
i
shall
traverse
it
in
its
whole
length
from
syria
to
the
bosphorus
i
may
find
it
replete
with
green
fields
and
pastures
new
which
shall
repay
me
for
relinquishing
the
first
and
more
ambitious
undertaking
at
least
i
have
so
much
reason
to
be
grateful
for
the
uninterrupted
good
health
and
good
luck
i
have
enjoyed
during
seven
months
in
africa
and
the
orient
that
i
can
not
be
otherwise
than
content
with
the
prospect
before
me
i
left
beyrout
on
the
night
of
the
of
may
with
harrison
who
has
decided
to
keep
me
company
as
far
as
constantinople
françois
our
classic
dragoman
whose
great
delight
is
to
recite
homer
by
the
is
retained
for
the
whole
tour
as
we
have
found
no
reason
to
doubt
his
honesty
or
ability
our
first
thought
was
to
proceed
to
aleppo
by
land
by
way
of
homs
and
hamah
whence
there
might
be
a
chance
of
reaching
palmyra
but
as
we
found
an
opportunity
of
engaging
an
american
yacht
for
the
voyage
up
the
coast
it
was
thought
preferable
to
take
her
and
save
time
she
was
a
neat
little
craft
called
the
american
eagle
brought
out
by
smith
our
consul
at
beyrout
so
one
fine
moonlit
night
we
slowly
crept
out
of
the
harbor
and
after
returning
a
volley
of
salutes
from
our
friends
at
demetri
hotel
ran
into
the
heart
of
a
which
poured
down
more
rain
than
all
i
had
seen
for
eight
months
before
but
our
raïs
assad
the
lion
was
worthy
of
his
name
and
had
two
good
christian
sailors
at
his
command
so
we
lay
in
the
cramped
little
cabin
and
heard
the
floods
washing
our
deck
without
fear
in
the
morning
we
were
off
tripoli
which
is
even
more
deeply
buried
than
beyrout
in
its
orange
and
mulberry
groves
and
slowly
wafted
along
the
bold
in
the
afternoon
reached
tartus
the
ancient
tortosa
a
mile
from
shore
is
the
rocky
island
of
aradus
entirely
covered
by
a
town
there
were
a
dozen
vessels
lying
in
the
harbor
the
remains
of
a
large
fortress
and
ancient
mole
prove
it
to
have
been
a
place
of
considerable
importance
tartus
is
a
small
old
place
on
the
not
so
large
nor
so
important
in
appearance
as
its
the
country
behind
is
green
and
hilly
though
but
partially
cultivated
and
rises
into
djebel
ansairiyeh
which
divides
the
valley
of
the
orontes
from
the
sea
it
is
a
lovely
coast
especially
under
the
flying
lights
and
shadows
of
such
a
breezy
day
as
we
had
the
wind
fell
at
sunset
but
by
the
next
morning
we
had
passed
the
of
latakiyeh
and
were
in
sight
of
the
southern
cape
of
the
bay
of
suediah
the
mountains
forming
this
cape
culminate
in
a
grand
conical
peak
about
feet
in
height
called
djebel
okrab
at
ten
wafted
along
by
a
slow
wind
we
turned
the
point
and
entered
the
bay
of
suediah
formed
by
the
embouchure
of
the
river
orontes
the
mountain
headland
of
akma
dagh
forming
the
portal
of
the
gulf
of
scanderoon
loomed
grandly
in
front
of
us
across
the
bay
and
far
beyond
it
we
could
just
distinguish
the
coast
of
karamania
the
range
of
taurus
the
coasts
of
syria
might
be
divided
like
those
of
guinea
according
to
the
nature
of
their
productions
the
northern
division
is
bold
and
bare
yet
flocks
of
sheep
graze
on
the
slopes
of
its
mountains
and
the
inland
plains
behind
them
are
covered
with
orchards
of
silk
is
cultivated
in
the
neighborhood
of
suediah
but
forms
only
a
small
portion
of
the
exports
this
region
may
be
called
the
wool
and
pistachio
coast
southward
from
latakiyeh
to
tartus
and
the
northern
limit
of
lebanon
extends
the
tobacco
coast
whose
undulating
hills
are
now
clothed
with
the
leaves
of
the
renowned
plant
from
tripoli
to
tyre
embracing
all
the
western
slope
of
lebanon
and
the
deep
rich
valleys
lying
between
his
knees
the
mulberry
predominates
and
the
land
is
covered
with
the
houses
of
thatch
and
matting
which
shelter
the
busy
worms
this
is
the
silk
coast
the
palmy
plains
of
jaffa
and
beyond
until
syria
meets
the
african
sands
between
gaza
and
constitute
the
orange
coast
the
vine
the
olive
and
the
fig
flourish
everywhere
we
were
all
day
getting
up
the
bay
and
it
seemed
as
if
we
should
never
pass
djebel
okrab
whose
pointed
top
rose
high
above
a
long
belt
of
fleecy
clouds
that
girdled
his
waist
at
sunset
we
made
the
mouth
of
the
orontes
our
lion
of
a
captain
tried
to
run
into
the
river
but
the
channel
was
very
narrow
and
when
within
three
hundred
yards
of
the
shore
the
yacht
struck
we
had
all
sail
set
and
had
the
wind
been
a
little
stronger
we
should
have
capsized
in
an
instant
the
lion
went
manfully
to
work
and
by
dint
of
hard
poling
shoved
us
off
and
came
to
anchor
in
deep
water
not
until
the
danger
was
past
did
he
open
his
batteries
on
the
unlucky
helmsman
and
then
the
explosion
of
arabic
oaths
was
equal
to
a
broadside
of
pounders
we
lay
all
night
rocking
on
the
swells
and
the
next
morning
by
firing
a
number
of
signal
guns
brought
out
a
boat
which
took
us
off
we
entered
the
mouth
of
the
orontes
and
sailed
nearly
a
mile
between
rich
wheat
meadows
before
reaching
the
of
suediah
two
or
three
uninhabited
stone
huts
with
three
or
four
small
turkish
craft
and
a
health
officer
the
town
lies
a
mile
or
two
inland
scattered
along
the
amid
gardens
so
luxuriant
as
almost
to
conceal
it
from
view
this
part
of
the
coast
is
ignorant
of
travellers
and
we
were
obliged
to
wait
half
a
day
before
we
could
find
a
sufficient
number
of
horses
to
take
us
to
antioch
twenty
miles
distant
when
they
came
they
were
solid
farmers
horses
with
the
rudest
gear
imaginable
i
was
obliged
to
mount
astride
of
a
broad
with
my
legs
suspended
in
coils
of
rope
leaving
the
meadows
we
entered
a
lane
of
the
wildest
richest
and
loveliest
bloom
and
foliage
our
way
was
overhung
with
hedges
of
pomegranate
myrtle
oleander
and
white
rose
in
blossom
and
occasionally
with
quince
fig
and
carob
trees
laced
together
with
grape
vines
in
fragrant
bloom
sometimes
this
wilderness
of
color
and
odor
met
above
our
heads
and
made
a
twilight
then
it
opened
into
long
dazzling
vistas
where
the
hues
of
the
oleander
pomegranate
and
white
rose
made
the
eye
wink
with
their
gorgeous
profusion
the
mountains
we
crossed
were
covered
with
thickets
of
myrtle
mastic
daphne
and
arbutus
and
all
the
valleys
and
sloping
meads
waved
with
fig
mulberry
and
olive
trees
looking
towards
the
sea
the
valley
broadened
out
between
mountain
ranges
whose
summits
were
lost
in
the
clouds
though
the
soil
was
not
so
rich
as
in
palestine
the
general
aspect
of
the
country
was
much
wilder
and
more
luxuriant
so
by
this
glorious
lane
over
the
myrtled
hills
and
down
into
valleys
whose
bed
was
one
hue
of
rose
from
the
blossoming
oleanders
we
travelled
for
five
hours
crossing
the
low
ranges
of
hills
through
which
the
orontes
forces
his
way
to
the
sea
at
last
we
reached
a
height
overlooking
the
valley
of
the
river
and
saw
in
the
east
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
chain
the
long
lines
of
barracks
built
by
ibrahim
pasha
for
the
defence
of
antioch
behind
them
the
ancient
wall
of
the
city
clomb
the
mountains
whose
crest
it
followed
to
the
last
peak
of
the
chain
from
the
next
hill
we
saw
the
city
a
large
extent
of
houses
with
tiled
roofs
surrounded
with
gardens
and
half
buried
in
the
foliage
of
sycamores
it
extends
from
the
river
orontes
which
washes
its
walls
up
the
slope
of
the
mountain
to
the
crags
of
gray
rock
which
overhang
it
we
crossed
the
river
by
a
massive
old
bridge
and
entered
the
town
riding
along
the
rills
of
filth
which
traverse
the
streets
forming
their
central
avenues
we
passed
through
several
lines
of
bazaars
to
a
large
and
khan
the
keeper
of
which
gave
us
the
best
vacant
chamber
a
narrow
place
full
of
fleas
antioch
presents
not
even
a
shadow
of
its
former
splendor
except
the
great
walls
ten
to
fifteen
miles
in
circuit
which
the
turks
have
done
their
best
to
destroy
every
vestige
of
the
old
city
has
disappeared
the
houses
are
all
of
one
story
on
account
of
earthquakes
from
which
antioch
has
suffered
more
than
any
other
city
in
the
world
at
one
time
during
the
middle
ages
it
lost
inhabitants
in
one
day
its
situation
is
magnificent
and
the
modern
town
notwithstanding
its
filth
wears
a
bright
and
busy
aspect
situated
at
the
base
of
a
lofty
mountain
it
overlooks
towards
the
east
a
plain
thirty
or
forty
miles
in
length
producing
the
most
abundant
harvests
a
great
number
of
the
inhabitants
are
workers
in
wood
and
leather
and
very
thrifty
and
cheerful
people
they
appear
to
be
we
remained
until
the
next
day
at
noon
by
which
time
a
scamp
the
chief
of
the
or
muleteers
succeeded
in
getting
us
five
miserable
beasts
for
the
journey
to
aleppo
on
leaving
the
city
we
travelled
along
a
former
street
of
antioch
part
of
the
ancient
pavement
still
remaining
and
after
two
miles
came
to
the
old
wall
of
circuit
which
we
passed
by
a
massive
gateway
of
roman
time
it
is
now
called
or
paul
gate
christianity
it
will
be
remembered
was
planted
in
antioch
by
paul
and
barnabas
and
the
apostle
peter
was
the
first
bishop
of
the
city
we
now
entered
the
great
plain
of
the
orontes
a
level
sea
rioting
in
the
wealth
of
its
ripening
harvests
the
river
lined
with
luxuriant
thickets
meandered
through
the
centre
of
this
glorious
picture
we
crossed
it
during
the
afternoon
and
keeping
on
our
eastward
course
encamped
at
night
in
a
meadow
near
the
tents
of
some
wandering
turcomans
who
furnished
us
with
butter
and
milk
from
their
herds
leaving
the
plain
the
next
morning
we
travelled
due
east
all
day
over
long
stony
ranges
of
mountains
inclosing
only
one
valley
which
bore
evidence
of
great
fertility
it
was
circular
about
ten
miles
in
its
greater
diameter
and
bounded
on
the
north
by
the
broad
peak
of
djebel
saman
or
mount
simon
in
the
morning
we
passed
a
ruined
castle
standing
in
a
dry
treeless
dell
among
the
hot
hills
the
muleteers
called
it
the
maiden
palace
and
said
that
it
was
built
long
ago
by
a
powerful
sultan
as
a
prison
for
his
daughter
for
several
hours
thereafter
our
road
was
lined
with
remains
of
buildings
apparently
dating
from
the
time
of
the
greek
empire
there
were
tombs
temples
of
massive
masonry
though
in
a
bad
style
of
architecture
and
long
rows
of
arched
chambers
which
resembled
they
were
all
more
or
less
shattered
by
earthquakes
but
in
one
place
i
noticed
twenty
such
arches
each
of
at
least
twenty
feet
span
hills
on
either
hand
as
far
as
we
could
see
were
covered
with
the
remains
of
buildings
in
the
plain
of
simon
i
saw
two
superb
pillars
apparently
part
of
a
portico
or
gateway
and
the
village
of
dana
is
formed
almost
entirely
of
churches
and
convents
of
the
lower
empire
there
were
but
few
inscriptions
and
these
i
could
not
read
but
the
whole
of
this
region
would
no
doubt
richly
repay
an
antiquarian
research
i
am
told
here
that
the
entire
chain
of
hills
which
extends
southward
for
more
than
a
hundred
miles
abounds
with
similar
remains
and
that
in
many
places
whole
cities
stand
almost
entire
as
if
recently
deserted
by
their
inhabitants
during
the
afternoon
we
came
upon
a
portion
of
the
ancient
road
from
antioch
to
aleppo
which
is
still
as
perfect
as
when
first
constructed
it
crossed
a
very
stony
ridge
and
is
much
the
finest
specimen
of
i
ever
saw
quite
putting
to
shame
the
appian
and
flaminian
ways
at
rome
it
is
twenty
feet
wide
and
laid
with
blocks
of
white
marble
from
two
to
four
feet
square
it
was
apparently
raised
upon
a
more
ancient
road
which
diverges
here
and
there
from
the
line
showing
the
traces
of
the
roman
in
the
barren
depths
of
the
mountains
we
found
every
hour
cisterns
cut
in
the
rock
and
filled
with
water
left
by
the
winter
rains
many
of
them
however
are
fast
drying
up
and
a
month
later
this
will
be
a
desert
road
towards
night
we
descended
from
the
hills
upon
the
plain
of
keftin
which
stretches
from
aleppo
till
the
which
fertilize
it
are
dried
up
when
it
is
merged
into
the
syrian
desert
its
northern
edge
along
which
we
travelled
is
covered
with
fields
of
wheat
cotton
and
we
stopped
all
night
at
a
village
called
taireb
planted
at
the
foot
of
a
tumulus
older
than
tradition
the
people
were
in
great
dread
of
the
aneyzeh
arabs
who
come
in
from
the
desert
to
destroy
their
harvests
and
carry
off
their
cattle
they
wanted
us
to
take
a
guard
but
after
our
experience
on
the
we
felt
safer
without
one
yesterday
we
travelled
for
seven
hours
over
a
wide
rolling
country
now
waste
and
barren
but
formerly
covered
with
wealth
and
supporting
an
abundant
population
evidences
of
which
are
found
in
the
buildings
everywhere
scattered
over
the
hills
on
and
on
we
toiled
in
the
heat
over
this
inhospitable
wilderness
and
though
we
knew
aleppo
must
be
very
near
yet
we
could
see
neither
sign
of
cultivation
nor
inhabitants
finally
about
three
the
top
of
a
line
of
shattered
wall
and
the
points
of
some
minarets
issued
out
of
the
earth
several
miles
in
front
of
us
and
on
climbing
a
glaring
chalky
ridge
the
renowned
city
burst
at
once
upon
our
view
it
filled
a
wide
hollow
or
basin
among
the
white
hills
against
which
its
whiter
houses
and
domes
glimmered
for
miles
in
the
dead
dreary
heat
of
the
afternoon
scarcely
relieved
by
the
narrow
belt
of
gardens
on
the
nearer
side
or
the
orchards
of
pistachio
trees
beyond
in
the
centre
of
the
city
rose
a
steep
abrupt
mound
crowned
with
the
remains
of
the
ancient
citadel
and
shining
minarets
shot
up
singly
or
in
clusters
around
its
base
the
prevailing
hue
of
the
landscape
was
a
and
the
long
stately
city
and
long
monotonous
hills
gleamed
with
equal
brilliancy
under
a
sky
of
cloudless
and
intense
blue
this
singular
monotony
of
coloring
gave
a
wonderful
effect
to
the
view
which
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
in
all
the
orient

our

into

was
a
fitting
preliminary
to
our
experiences
during
the
five
days
we
have
spent
here
after
passing
a
blackamoor
who
acted
as
an
advanced
guard
of
the
custom
house
at
a
ragged
tent
outside
of
the
city
and
bribing
him
with
two
piastres
we
crossed
the
narrow
line
of
gardens
on
the
western
side
and
entered
the
streets
there
were
many
filled
with
smokers
nearly
all
of
whom
accosted
us
in
turkish
though
arabic
is
the
prevailing
language
here
ignorance
made
us
discourteous
and
we
slighted
every
attempt
to
open
a
conversation
out
of
the
narrow
streets
of
the
suburbs
we
advanced
to
the
bazaars
in
order
to
find
a
khan
where
we
could
obtain
lodgings
all
the
best
khans
however
were
filled
and
we
were
about
to
take
a
very
inferior
room
when
a
respectable
individual
came
up
to
françois
and
said
the
house
is
ready
for
the
travellers
and
i
will
show
you
the
way
we
were
a
little
surprised
at
this
address
but
followed
him
to
a
neat
quiet
and
pleasant
street
near
the
bazaars
where
we
were
ushered
into
a
spacious
with
a
row
of
apartments
opening
upon
it
and
told
to
make
ourselves
at
home
the
place
had
evidently
been
recently
inhabited
for
the
rooms
were
well
furnished
with
not
only
divans
but
beds
in
the
frank
style
a
lean
kitten
was
scratching
at
one
of
the
windows
to
the
great
danger
of
overturning
a
pair
of
narghilehs
a
tame
was
walking
about
the
court
and
two
sheep
bleated
in
a
stable
at
the
further
end
in
the
kitchen
we
not
only
found
a
variety
of
utensils
but
eggs
salt
pepper
and
other
condiments
our
guide
had
left
and
the
only
information
we
could
get
from
a
dyeing
establishment
next
door
was
that
the
occupants
had
gone
into
the
country
take
the
good
the
gods
provide
thee
is
my
rule
in
such
cases
and
as
we
were
very
hungry
we
set
françois
to
work
at
preparing
dinner
we
arranged
a
divan
in
the
open
air
had
a
table
brought
out
and
by
the
aid
of
the
bakers
in
the
bazaar
and
the
stores
which
the
kitchen
supplied
soon
rejoiced
over
a
very
palatable
meal
the
romantic
character
of
our
reception
made
the
dinner
a
merry
one
it
was
a
chapter
out
of
the
arabian
nights
and
be
he
genie
or
afrite
caliph
or
merchant
of
bassora
into
whose
hands
we
had
fallen
we
resolved
to
let
the
adventure
take
its
course
we
were
just
finishing
a
nondescript
pastry
which
françois
found
at
a
baker
and
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
he
called
à
la
khorassan
when
there
was
a
loud
knock
at
the
street
door
we
felt
at
first
some
little
trepidation
but
determined
to
maintain
our
places
and
gravely
invite
the
real
master
to
join
us
it
was
a
female
servant
however
who
to
our
great
amazement
made
a
profound
salutation
and
seemed
delighted
to
see
us
my
master
did
not
expect
your
excellencies
he
has
gone
into
the
gardens
but
will
soon
return
will
your
excellencies
take
coffee
after
your
dinner
and
coffee
was
forthwith
served
the
old
woman
was
unremitting
in
her
attentions
and
her
son
a
boy
of
eight
years
and
the
most
venerable
child
i
ever
saw
entertained
us
with
the
description
of
a
horse
which
his
master
had
just
bought
a
horse
which
had
cost
two
thousand
piastres
and
was
ninety
years
old
well
this
aleppo
is
an
extraordinary
place
was
my
first
impression
and
the
inhabitants
are
remarkable
people
but
i
waited
the
master
arrival
as
the
only
means
of
solving
the
mystery
about
dusk
there
was
another
rap
at
the
door
a
lady
dressed
in
white
with
an
indian
handkerchief
bound
over
her
black
hair
arrived
pray
excuse
us
said
she
we
thought
you
would
not
reach
here
before
but
my
brother
will
come
directly
in
fact
the
brother
did
come
soon
afterwards
and
greeted
us
with
a
still
warmer
welcome
before
leaving
the
gardens
he
said
i
heard
of
your
arrival
and
have
come
in
a
full
gallop
the
whole
way
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
this
comedy
of
errors
i
declared
at
once
that
he
was
mistaken
nobody
in
aleppo
could
possibly
know
of
our
coming
and
we
were
perhaps
transgressing
on
his
hospitality
but
no
he
would
not
be
convinced
he
was
a
dragoman
to
the
english
consulate
his
master
had
told
him
we
would
be
here
the
next
day
and
he
must
be
prepared
to
receive
us
besides
the
janissary
of
the
consulate
had
showed
us
the
way
to
his
house
we
therefore
let
the
matter
rest
until
next
morning
when
we
called
on
mr
very
the
consul
who
informed
us
that
the
janissary
had
mistaken
us
for
two
gentlemen
we
had
met
in
damascus
the
travelling
companions
of
lord
dalkeith
as
they
had
not
arrived
he
begged
us
to
remain
in
the
quarters
which
had
been
prepared
for
them
we
have
every
reason
to
be
glad
of
this
mistake
as
it
has
made
us
acquainted
with
one
of
the
most
courteous
and
hospitable
gentlemen
in
the
east
aleppo
lies
so
far
out
of
the
usual
routes
of
travel
that
it
is
rarely
visited
by
europeans
one
is
not
therefore
as
in
the
case
of
damascus
prepared
beforehand
by
volumes
of
description
which
preclude
all
possibility
of
mistake
or
surprise
for
my
part
i
only
knew
that
aleppo
had
once
been
the
greatest
commercial
city
of
the
orient
though
its
power
had
long
since
passed
into
other
hands
but
there
were
certain
stately
associations
lingering
around
the
name
which
drew
me
towards
it
and
obliged
me
to
include
it
at
all
hazards
in
my
asiatic
tour
the
scanty
description
of
captains
irby
and
mangles
the
only
one
i
had
read
gave
me
no
distinct
idea
of
its
position
or
appearance
and
when
the
other
day
i
first
saw
it
looming
grand
and
gray
among
the
gray
hills
more
like
a
vast
natural
crystallization
than
the
product
of
human
art
i
revelled
in
the
novelty
of
that
startling
first
impression
the
tradition
of
the
city
name
is
curious
and
worth
relating
it
is
called
in
arabic
aleppo
the
gray
which
most
persons
suppose
to
refer
to
the
prevailing
color
of
the
soil
the
legend
however
goes
much
farther
which
the
venetians
and
genoese
softened
into
aleppo
means
literally
has
milked
according
to
arab
tradition
the
patriarch
abraham
once
lived
here
his
tent
being
pitched
near
the
mound
now
occupied
by
the
citadel
he
had
a
certain
gray
cow
which
was
milked
every
morning
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
when
therefore
it
was
proclaimed
haleb
abraham
has
milked
the
gray
cow
all
the
poor
of
the
tribe
came
up
to
receive
their
share
the
repetition
of
this
morning
call
attached
itself
to
the
spot
and
became
the
name
of
the
city
which
was
afterwards
founded
aleppo
is
built
on
the
eastern
slope
of
a
shallow
upland
basin
through
which
flows
the
little
river
koweik
there
are
low
hills
to
the
north
and
south
between
which
the
country
falls
into
a
wide
monotonous
plain
extending
unbroken
to
the
euphrates
the
city
is
from
eight
to
ten
miles
in
circuit
and
though
not
so
thickly
populated
covers
a
greater
extent
of
space
than
damascus
the
population
is
estimated
at
in
the
excellence
not
the
elegance
of
its
architecture
it
surpasses
any
oriental
city
i
have
yet
seen
the
houses
are
all
of
hewn
stone
frequently
three
and
even
four
stories
in
height
and
built
in
a
most
massive
and
durable
style
on
account
of
the
frequency
of
earthquakes
the
streets
are
well
paved
clean
with
narrow
sidewalks
and
less
tortuous
and
intricate
than
the
bewildering
alleys
of
damascus
a
large
part
of
the
town
is
occupied
with
bazaars
attesting
the
splendor
of
its
former
commerce
these
establishments
are
covered
with
lofty
vaults
of
stone
lighted
from
the
top
and
one
may
walk
for
miles
beneath
the
spacious
roofs
the
shops
exhibit
all
the
stuffs
of
the
east
especially
of
persia
and
india
there
is
also
an
extensive
display
of
european
fabrics
as
the
eastern
provinces
of
asiatic
turkey
as
far
as
baghdad
are
supplied
entirely
from
aleppo
and
trebizond
within
ten
years
in
fact
since
the
allied
powers
drove
ibrahim
pasha
out
of
syria
the
trade
of
aleppo
has
increased
at
the
expense
of
damascus
the
tribes
of
the
desert
who
were
held
in
check
during
the
egyptian
occupancy
are
now
so
unruly
that
much
of
the
commerce
between
the
latter
place
and
baghdad
goes
northward
to
mosul
and
thence
by
a
safer
road
to
this
city
the
khans
of
which
there
are
a
great
number
built
on
a
scale
according
with
the
former
magnificence
of
aleppo
are
nearly
all
filled
and
persian
georgian
and
armenian
merchants
again
make
their
appearance
in
the
bazaars
the
principal
manufactures
carried
on
are
the
making
of
shoes
which
indeed
is
a
prominent
branch
in
every
turkish
city
and
the
weaving
of
silk
and
golden
tissues
two
long
bazaars
are
entirely
occupied
with
and
there
is
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
confectionery
embracing
more
varieties
than
i
ever
saw
or
imagined
possible
i
saw
yesterday
the
operation
of
weaving
silk
and
gold
which
is
a
very
slow
process
the
warp
and
the
body
of
the
woof
were
of
purple
silk
the
loom
only
differed
from
the
old
in
general
use
in
having
some
thirty
or
forty
contrivances
for
lifting
the
threads
of
the
warp
so
as
to
form
by
variation
certain
patterns
the
gold
threads
by
which
the
pattern
was
worked
were
contained
in
twenty
small
shuttles
thrust
by
hand
under
the
different
parcels
of
the
warp
as
they
were
raised
by
a
boy
trained
for
that
purpose
who
sat
on
the
top
of
the
loom
the
fabric
was
very
brilliant
in
its
appearance
and
sells
as
the
weavers
informed
me
at
piastres
per
about
per
yard
we
had
letters
to
ford
an
american
missionary
established
here
and
signor
di
picciotto
who
acts
as
american
both
gentlemen
have
been
very
cordial
in
their
offers
of
service
and
by
their
aid
we
have
been
enabled
to
see
something
of
aleppo
life
and
society
ford
who
has
been
here
four
years
has
a
pleasant
residence
at
jedaida
a
christian
suburb
of
the
city
his
congregation
numbers
some
fifty
or
sixty
proselytes
who
are
mostly
from
the
schismatic
sects
of
the
armenians
smith
who
established
the
mission
at
two
days
journey
north
of
this
where
he
died
last
year
was
very
successful
among
these
sects
and
the
congregation
there
amounts
to
nine
hundred
the
sultan
a
year
ago
issued
a
firman
permitting
his
christian
subjects
to
erect
houses
of
worship
but
although
this
was
proclaimed
in
constantinople
and
much
lauded
in
europe
as
an
act
of
great
generosity
and
tolerance
there
has
been
no
official
promulgation
of
it
here
so
of
the
aid
which
the
turkish
government
was
said
to
have
afforded
to
its
destitute
christian
subjects
whose
houses
were
sacked
during
the
fanatical
rebellion
of
the
world
praised
the
sultan
charity
and
love
of
justice
while
the
sufferers
to
this
day
lack
the
first
experience
of
it
but
for
the
spontaneous
relief
contributed
in
europe
and
among
the
christian
communities
of
the
levant
the
amount
of
misery
would
have
been
frightful
to
feridj
pasha
who
is
at
present
the
commander
of
the
forces
here
is
mainly
due
the
credit
of
having
put
down
the
rebels
with
a
strong
hand
there
were
but
few
troops
in
the
city
at
the
time
of
the
outbreak
and
as
the
insurgents
who
were
composed
of
the
turkish
and
arab
population
were
in
league
with
the
aneyzehs
of
the
desert
the
least
faltering
or
delay
would
have
led
to
a
universal
massacre
of
the
christians
fortunately
the
troops
were
divided
into
two
portions
one
occupying
the
barracks
on
a
hill
north
of
the
city
and
the
other
a
mere
corporal
guard
of
a
dozen
men
posted
in
the
citadel
the
leaders
of
the
outbreak
went
to
the
latter
and
offered
him
a
large
sum
of
money
the
spoils
of
christian
houses
to
give
up
the
fortress
with
a
loyalty
to
his
duty
truly
miraculous
among
the
turks
he
ordered
his
men
to
fire
upon
them
and
they
beat
a
hasty
retreat
the
quarter
of
the
insurgents
lay
precisely
between
the
barracks
and
the
citadel
and
by
order
of
feridj
pasha
a
cannonade
was
immediately
opened
on
it
from
both
points
it
was
not
however
until
many
houses
had
been
battered
down
and
a
still
larger
number
destroyed
by
fire
that
the
rebels
were
brought
to
submission
their
allies
the
aneyzehs
appeared
on
the
hill
east
of
aleppo
to
the
number
of
five
or
six
thousand
but
a
few
told
them
what
they
might
expect
and
they
speedily
retreated
two
or
three
hundred
christian
families
lost
nearly
all
of
their
property
during
the
sack
and
many
were
left
entirely
destitute
the
house
in
which
ford
lives
was
plundered
of
jewels
and
furniture
to
the
amount
of
piastres
the
robbers
it
is
said
were
amazed
at
the
amount
of
spoil
they
found
the
government
made
some
feeble
efforts
to
recover
it
but
the
greater
part
was
already
sold
and
scattered
through
a
thousand
hands
and
the
unfortunate
christians
have
only
received
about
seven
per
cent
of
their
loss
the
burnt
quarter
has
since
been
rebuilt
and
i
noticed
several
christians
occupying
shops
in
various
parts
of
it
but
many
families
who
fled
at
the
time
still
remain
in
various
parts
of
syria
afraid
to
return
to
their
homes
the
aneyzehs
and
other
desert
tribes
have
latterly
become
more
daring
than
ever
even
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
city
the
inhabitants
are
so
fearful
of
them
that
all
the
grain
is
brought
up
to
the
very
walls
to
be
threshed
the
on
both
sides
are
now
turned
into
and
all
day
long
the
turkish
peasants
drive
their
heavy
sleds
around
among
the
on
the
second
day
after
our
arrival
we
paid
a
visit
to
osman
pasha
governor
of
the
city
and
province
of
aleppo
we
went
in
state
accompanied
by
the
consul
with
two
janissaries
in
front
bearing
silver
maces
and
a
dragoman
behind
the
or
palace
is
a
large
plain
wooden
building
and
a
group
of
soldiers
about
the
door
with
a
shabby
carriage
in
the
court
were
the
only
tokens
of
its
character
we
were
ushered
at
once
into
the
presence
of
the
pasha
who
is
a
man
of
about
seventy
years
with
a
though
shrewd
face
he
was
quite
cordial
in
his
manners
complimenting
us
on
our
turkish
costume
and
vaunting
his
skill
in
physiognomy
which
at
once
revealed
to
him
that
we
belonged
to
the
highest
class
of
american
nobility
in
fact
in
the
firman
which
he
has
since
sent
us
we
are
mentioned
as
nobles
he
invited
us
to
pass
a
day
or
two
with
him
saying
that
he
should
derive
much
benefit
from
our
superior
knowledge
we
replied
that
such
an
intercourse
could
only
benefit
ourselves
as
his
greater
experience
and
the
distinguished
wisdom
which
had
made
his
name
long
since
familiar
to
our
ears
precluded
the
hope
of
our
being
of
any
service
to
him
after
half
an
hour
stay
during
which
we
were
regaled
with
jewelled
pipes
exquisite
mocha
coffee
and
sherbet
breathing
of
the
gardens
of
gülistan
we
took
our
leave
the
pasha
sent
an
officer
to
show
us
the
citadel
we
passed
around
the
moat
to
the
entrance
on
the
western
side
consisting
of
a
bridge
and
double
gateway
the
fortress
as
i
have
already
stated
occupies
the
crest
of
an
elliptical
mound
about
one
thousand
feet
by
six
hundred
and
two
hundred
feet
in
height
it
is
entirely
encompassed
by
the
city
and
forms
a
prominent
and
picturesque
feature
in
the
distant
view
thereof
formerly
it
was
thickly
inhabited
and
at
the
time
of
the
great
earthquake
of
there
were
three
hundred
families
living
within
the
walls
nearly
all
of
whom
perished
the
outer
walls
were
very
much
shattered
on
that
occasion
but
the
enormous
towers
and
the
gateway
the
grandest
specimen
of
saracenic
architecture
in
the
east
still
remain
entire
this
gateway
by
which
we
entered
is
colossal
in
its
proportions
the
outer
entrance
through
walls
ten
feet
thick
admitted
us
into
a
lofty
vestibule
lined
with
marble
and
containing
many
ancient
inscriptions
in
mosaic
over
the
main
portal
which
is
adorned
with
sculptured
lions
heads
there
is
a
tablet
stating
that
the
fortress
was
built
by
el
melek
el
ashraf
the
holiest
of
kings
after
which
follows
prosperity
to
the
true
believers
death
to
the
infidels
a
second
tablet
shows
that
it
was
afterwards
repaired
by
mohammed
who
i
believe
was
one
of
the
fatimite
caliphs
the
shekh
of
the
citadel
who
accompanied
us
stated
the
age
of
the
structure
at
nine
hundred
years
which
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
the
saracenic
chronology
is
correct
he
called
our
attention
to
numbers
of
iron
sticking
in
the
solid
masonry
the
marks
of
ancient
sieges
before
leaving
we
were
presented
with
a
bundle
of
arrows
from
the
armory
undoubted
relics
of
saracen
warfare
the
citadel
is
now
a
mass
of
ruins
having
been
deserted
since
the
earthquake
grass
is
growing
on
the
ramparts
and
the
caper
plant
with
its
blossoms
flourishes
among
the
piles
of
rubbish
since
the
late
rebellion
however
a
small
military
barrack
has
been
built
and
two
companies
of
soldiers
are
stationed
there
we
walked
around
the
walls
which
command
a
magnificent
view
of
the
city
and
the
wide
plains
to
the
south
and
east
it
well
deserves
to
rank
with
the
panorama
of
cairo
from
the
citadel
and
that
of
damascus
from
the
in
extent
picturesqueness
and
rich
oriental
character
out
of
the
gray
ring
of
the
city
which
incloses
the
mound
rise
the
great
white
domes
and
the
whiter
minarets
of
its
numerous
mosques
many
of
which
are
grand
and
imposing
structures
the
course
of
the
river
through
the
centre
of
the
picture
is
marked
by
a
belt
of
the
greenest
verdure
beyond
which
to
the
west
rises
a
chain
of
naked
red
hills
and
still
further
fading
on
the
horizon
the
blue
summit
of
mt
simon
and
the
coast
range
of
akma
dagh
eastward
over
vast
orchards
of
pistachio
trees
the
barren
plain
of
the
euphrates
fades
away
to
a
glimmering
hot
horizon
looking
downwards
on
the
heart
of
the
city
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
number
of
open
grassy
tracts
out
of
which
here
and
there
small
trees
were
growing
but
perceiving
what
appeared
to
be
subterranean
entrances
at
various
points
i
found
that
these
tracts
were
upon
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
bazaars
verifying
what
i
had
frequently
heard
that
in
aleppo
the
inhabitants
visit
their
friends
in
different
parts
of
the
city
by
passing
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
previous
to
the
earthquake
of
these
vast
were
cultivated
as
gardens
and
presented
an
extent
of
airy
bowers
as
large
if
not
as
magnificent
as
the
renowned
hanging
gardens
of
ancient
babylon
accompanied
by
signor
di
picciotto
we
spent
two
or
three
days
in
visiting
the
houses
of
the
principal
jewish
and
christian
families
in
aleppo
we
found
it
is
true
no
such
splendor
as
in
damascus
but
more
solid
and
durable
architecture
and
a
more
chastened
elegance
of
taste
the
buildings
are
all
of
hewn
stone
the
paved
with
marble
and
the
walls
rich
with
gilding
and
carved
wood
some
of
the
larger
dwellings
have
small
but
beautiful
gardens
attached
to
them
we
were
everywhere
received
with
the
greatest
hospitality
and
the
visits
were
considered
as
a
favor
rather
than
an
intrusion
indeed
i
was
frequently
obliged
to
run
the
risk
of
giving
offence
by
declining
the
refreshments
which
were
offered
us
each
round
of
visits
was
a
feat
of
strength
and
we
were
obliged
to
desist
from
sheer
inability
to
support
more
coffee
pipes
and
aromatic
sweetmeats
the
character
of
society
in
aleppo
is
singular
its
very
life
and
essence
is
etiquette
the
laws
which
govern
it
are
more
inviolable
than
those
of
the
medes
and
persians
the
question
of
precedence
among
the
different
families
is
adjusted
by
the
most
delicate
scale
and
rigorously
adhered
to
in
the
most
trifling
matters
even
we
humble
voyagers
as
we
are
have
been
obliged
to
regulate
our
conduct
according
to
it
after
our
having
visited
certain
families
certain
others
would
have
been
deeply
mortified
had
we
neglected
to
call
upon
them
formerly
when
a
traveller
arrived
here
he
was
expected
to
call
upon
the
different
consuls
in
the
order
of
their
established
precedence
the
austrian
first
english
second
french
third
after
this
he
was
obliged
to
stay
at
home
several
days
to
give
the
consuls
an
opportunity
of
returning
the
visits
which
they
made
in
the
same
order
there
was
a
diplomatic
importance
about
all
his
movements
and
the
least
violation
of
etiquette
through
ignorance
or
neglect
was
the
town
talk
for
days
this
peculiarity
in
society
is
evidently
a
relic
of
the
formal
times
when
aleppo
was
a
city
and
the
opulent
seat
of
eastern
commerce
many
of
the
inhabitants
are
descended
from
the
traders
of
those
times
and
they
all
speak
the
or
levantine
italian
the
women
wear
a
costume
partly
turkish
and
partly
european
combining
the
graces
of
both
it
is
in
my
eyes
the
most
beautiful
dress
in
the
world
they
wear
a
rich
scarf
of
some
dark
color
on
the
head
which
on
festive
occasions
is
almost
concealed
by
their
jewels
and
the
heavy
scarlet
pomegranate
blossoms
which
adorn
their
dark
hair
a
turkish
vest
and
sleeves
of
embroidered
silk
open
in
front
and
a
skirt
of
white
or
some
light
color
completes
the
costume
the
jewesses
wear
in
addition
a
short
turkish
and
full
trousers
gathered
at
the
ankles
at
a
ball
given
by
mr
very
the
english
consul
which
we
attended
all
the
christian
beauties
of
aleppo
were
present
there
was
a
fine
display
of
diamonds
many
of
the
ladies
wearing
several
thousand
dollars
worth
on
their
heads
the
peculiar
etiquette
of
the
place
was
again
illustrated
on
this
occasion
the
custom
is
that
the
music
must
be
heard
for
at
least
one
hour
before
the
guests
come
the
hour
appointed
was
eight
but
when
we
went
there
at
nine
nobody
had
arrived
as
it
was
generally
supposed
that
the
ball
was
given
on
our
account
several
of
the
families
had
servants
in
the
neighborhood
to
watch
our
arrival
and
accordingly
we
had
not
been
there
five
minutes
before
the
guests
crowded
through
the
door
in
large
numbers
when
the
first
dance
an
arab
dance
performed
by
two
ladies
at
a
time
was
proposed
the
wives
of
the
french
and
spanish
consuls
were
first
led
or
rather
dragged
out
when
a
lady
is
asked
to
dance
she
invariably
refuses
she
is
asked
a
second
and
a
third
time
and
if
the
gentleman
does
not
solicit
most
earnestly
and
use
some
gentle
force
in
getting
her
upon
the
floor
she
never
forgives
him
at
one
of
the
jewish
houses
which
we
visited
the
wedding
festivities
of
one
of
the
daughters
were
being
celebrated
we
were
welcomed
with
great
cordiality
and
immediately
ushered
into
the
room
of
state
an
elegant
apartment
overlooking
the
gardens
below
the
city
wall
half
the
room
was
occupied
by
a
raised
platform
with
a
divan
of
blue
silk
cushions
here
the
ladies
reclined
in
superb
dresses
of
blue
pink
and
gold
while
the
gentlemen
were
ranged
on
the
floor
below
they
all
rose
at
our
entrance
and
we
were
conducted
to
seats
among
the
ladies
pipes
and
perfumed
drinks
were
served
and
the
bridal
cake
made
of
different
fruits
was
presented
on
a
golden
salver
our
fair
neighbors
some
of
whom
literally
blazed
with
jewels
were
strikingly
beautiful
presently
the
bride
appeared
at
the
door
and
we
all
rose
and
remained
standing
as
she
advanced
supported
on
each
side
by
the
two
or
bridesmaids
she
was
about
sixteen
slight
and
graceful
in
appearance
though
not
decidedly
beautiful
and
was
attired
with
the
utmost
elegance
her
dress
was
a
pale
blue
silk
heavy
with
gold
embroidery
and
over
her
long
dark
hair
her
neck
bosom
and
wrists
played
a
thousand
rainbow
gleams
from
the
jewels
which
covered
them
the
jewish
musicians
seated
at
the
bottom
of
the
hall
struck
up
a
loud
rejoicing
harmony
on
their
violins
guitars
and
dulcimers
and
the
women
servants
grouped
at
the
door
uttered
in
chorus
that
wild
shrill
cry
which
accompanies
all
such
festivals
in
the
east
the
bride
was
careful
to
preserve
the
decorum
expected
of
her
by
speaking
no
word
nor
losing
the
sad
resigned
expression
of
her
countenance
she
ascended
to
the
divan
bowed
to
each
of
us
with
a
low
reverential
inclination
and
seated
herself
on
the
cushions
the
music
and
dances
lasted
some
time
accompanied
by
the
or
cry
of
the
women
which
was
repeated
with
double
force
when
we
rose
to
take
leave
the
whole
company
waited
on
us
to
the
street
door
and
one
of
the
servants
stationed
in
the
court
shouted
some
long
phrases
after
us
as
we
passed
out
i
could
not
learn
the
words
but
was
told
that
it
was
an
invocation
of
prosperity
upon
us
in
return
for
the
honor
which
our
visit
had
conferred
in
the
evening
i
went
to
view
a
christian
marriage
procession
which
about
midnight
conveyed
the
bride
to
the
house
of
the
bridegroom
the
house
it
appeared
was
too
small
to
receive
all
the
friends
of
the
family
and
i
joined
a
large
number
of
them
who
repaired
to
the
terrace
of
the
english
consulate
to
greet
the
procession
as
it
passed
the
first
persons
who
appeared
were
a
company
of
buffoons
after
them
four
janissaries
carrying
silver
maces
then
the
male
friends
bearing
colored
lanterns
and
perfumed
torches
raised
on
gilded
poles
then
the
females
among
whom
i
saw
some
beautiful
madonna
faces
in
the
torchlight
and
finally
the
bride
herself
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
a
veil
of
cloth
of
gold
and
urged
along
by
two
maidens
for
it
is
the
etiquette
of
such
occasions
that
the
bride
should
resist
being
taken
and
must
be
forced
every
step
of
the
way
so
that
she
is
frequently
three
hours
in
going
the
distance
of
a
mile
we
watched
the
procession
a
long
time
winding
away
through
the
streets
a
line
of
torches
and
songs
and
incense
and
noisy
jubilee
under
the
sweet
starlit
heaven
the
other
evening
signor
di
picciotto
mounted
us
from
his
fine
arabian
stud
and
we
rode
around
the
city
outside
of
the
suburbs
the
sun
was
low
and
a
pale
yellow
lustre
touched
the
clusters
of
minarets
that
rose
out
of
the
stately
masses
of
buildings
and
the
bare
chalky
hills
to
the
north
after
leaving
the
gardens
on
the
banks
of
the
koweik
we
came
upon
a
dreary
waste
of
ruins
among
which
the
antiquarian
finds
traces
of
the
ancient
aleppo
of
the
greeks
the
mongolian
conquerors
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
saracens
who
succeeded
them
there
are
many
mosques
and
tombs
which
were
once
imposing
specimens
of
saracenic
art
but
now
split
and
shivered
by
wars
and
earthquakes
are
slowly
tumbling
into
utter
decay
on
the
side
of
the
city
its
chalk
foundations
have
been
hollowed
into
vast
arched
caverns
which
extend
deep
into
the
earth
pillars
have
been
left
at
regular
intervals
to
support
the
masses
above
and
their
huge
dim
labyrinths
resemble
the
crypts
of
some
great
cathedral
they
are
now
used
as
and
filled
with
cheerful
workmen
our
last
excursion
was
to
a
of
signor
di
picciotto
in
the
gardens
of
babala
about
four
miles
from
aleppo
we
set
out
in
the
afternoon
on
our
arabians
with
our
host
son
on
a
large
white
donkey
of
the
baghdad
breed
passing
the
turkish
cemetery
where
we
stopped
to
view
the
tomb
of
general
bem
we
loosened
rein
and
sped
away
at
full
gallop
over
the
hot
white
hills
in
dashing
down
a
stony
rise
the
ambitious
donkey
who
was
doing
his
best
to
keep
up
with
the
horses
fell
hurling
master
picciotto
over
his
head
the
boy
was
bruised
a
little
but
set
his
teeth
together
and
showed
no
sign
of
pain
mounted
again
and
followed
us
the
gardens
of
babala
are
a
wilderness
of
like
those
of
damascus
signor
is
buried
in
a
wild
grove
of
apricot
fig
orange
and
a
large
marble
tank
in
front
of
the
open
arched
supplies
it
with
water
we
mounted
to
the
flat
roof
and
watched
the
sunset
fade
from
the
beautiful
landscape
beyond
the
bowers
of
dazzling
greenness
which
surrounded
us
stretched
the
wide
gray
hills
the
minarets
of
aleppo
and
the
walls
of
its
castled
mount
shone
rosily
in
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
an
old
palace
of
the
pashas
with
the
long
low
barracks
of
the
soldiery
crowned
the
top
of
a
hill
to
the
north
dark
spiry
cypresses
betrayed
the
place
of
tombs
and
to
the
west
beyond
the
bare
red
peak
of
mount
simon
rose
the
faint
blue
outline
of
giaour
dagh
whose
mural
chain
divides
syria
from
the
plains
of
cilicia
as
the
twilight
deepened
over
the
scene
there
came
a
long
melodious
cry
of
passion
and
of
sorrow
from
the
heart
of
a
pomegranate
tree
in
the
garden
other
voices
answered
it
from
the
gardens
around
until
not
one
but
fifty
nightingales
charmed
the
repose
of
the
hour
they
vied
with
each
other
in
their
bursts
of
passionate
music
each
strain
soared
over
the
last
or
united
with
others
near
and
far
in
a
chorus
of
the
divinest
pathos
an
expression
of
sweet
unutterable
unquenchable
longing
it
was
an
ecstasy
yet
a
pain
to
listen
away
said
jean
paul
to
music
thou
tellest
me
of
that
which
i
have
not
and
never
can
have
which
i
forever
seek
and
never
find
but
space
fails
me
to
describe
half
the
incidents
of
our
stay
in
aleppo
there
are
two
things
peculiar
to
the
city
however
which
i
must
not
omit
mentioning
one
is
the
aleppo
button
a
singular
ulcer
which
attacks
every
person
born
in
the
city
and
every
stranger
who
spends
more
than
a
month
there
it
can
neither
be
prevented
nor
cured
and
always
lasts
for
a
year
the
inhabitants
almost
invariably
have
it
on
the
face
either
on
the
cheek
forehead
or
tip
of
the
nose
where
it
often
leaves
an
indelible
and
disfiguring
scar
strangers
on
the
contrary
have
it
on
one
of
the
joints
either
the
elbow
wrist
knee
or
ankle
so
strictly
is
its
visitation
confined
to
the
city
proper
that
in
none
of
the
neighboring
villages
nor
even
in
a
distant
suburb
is
it
known
physicians
have
vainly
attempted
to
prevent
it
by
inoculation
and
are
at
a
loss
to
what
cause
to
ascribe
it
we
are
liable
to
have
it
even
after
five
days
stay
but
i
hope
it
will
postpone
its
appearance
until
after
i
reach
home
the
other
remarkable
thing
here
is
the
hospital
for
cats
this
was
founded
long
ago
by
a
rich
mussulman
and
is
one
of
the
best
endowed
institutions
in
the
city
an
old
mosque
is
appropriated
to
the
purpose
under
the
charge
of
several
directors
and
here
sick
cats
are
nursed
homeless
cats
find
shelter
and
decrepit
cats
gratefully
purr
away
their
declining
years
the
whole
category
embraces
several
hundreds
and
it
is
quite
a
sight
to
behold
the
court
the
corridors
and
terraces
of
the
mosque
swarming
with
them
here
one
with
a
bruised
limb
is
receiving
a
cataplasm
there
a
cataleptic
patient
is
tenderly
cared
for
and
so
on
through
the
long
concatenation
of
feline
diseases
aleppo
moreover
rejoices
in
a
greater
number
of
cats
than
even
jerusalem
at
a
rough
guess
i
should
thus
state
the
population
of
the
city
turks
and
arabs
christians
of
all
denominations
jews
dogs
and
cats
among
other
persons
whom
i
have
met
here
is
ferhat
pasha
formerly
general
stein
hungarian
minister
of
war
and
governor
of
transylvania
he
accepted
moslemism
with
bem
and
others
and
now
rejoices
in
his
circumcision
and
piastres
a
month
he
is
a
fat
companionable
sort
of
man
who
by
his
own
confession
never
labored
very
zealously
for
the
independence
of
hungary
being
an
austrian
by
birth
he
conversed
with
me
for
several
hours
on
the
scenes
in
which
he
had
participated
and
attributed
the
failure
of
the
hungarians
to
the
want
of
material
means
general
bem
who
died
here
is
spoken
of
with
the
utmost
respect
both
by
turks
and
christians
the
former
have
honored
him
with
a
large
tomb
or
mausoleum
covered
with
a
dome
but
i
must
close
leaving
half
unsaid
suffice
it
to
say
that
no
oriental
city
has
interested
me
so
profoundly
as
aleppo
and
in
none
have
i
received
such
universal
and
cordial
hospitality

we
left
aleppo
on
the
morning
of
the
under
circumstances
not
the
most
promising
for
the
harmony
of
our
journey
we
had
engaged
horses
and
from
the
or
chief
of
the
muleteers
and
in
order
to
be
certain
of
having
animals
that
would
not
break
down
on
the
way
made
a
particular
selection
from
a
number
that
were
brought
us
when
about
leaving
the
city
however
we
discovered
that
one
of
the
horses
had
been
changed
signor
di
picciotto
who
accompanied
us
past
the
barriers
immediately
dispatched
the
delinquent
muleteer
to
bring
back
the
true
horse
and
the
latter
made
a
farce
of
trying
to
find
him
leading
the
consul
and
the
capidji
who
i
believe
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
cheat
a
chase
over
the
hills
around
aleppo
where
of
course
the
animal
was
not
to
be
seen
when
at
length
we
had
waited
three
hours
and
had
wandered
about
four
miles
from
the
city
we
gave
up
the
search
took
leave
of
the
consul
and
went
on
with
the
new
horse
our
proper
plan
would
have
been
to
pitch
the
tent
and
refuse
to
move
till
the
matter
was
settled
the
animal
as
we
discovered
during
the
first
day
journey
was
hopelessly
lame
and
we
only
added
to
the
difficulty
by
taking
him
we
rode
westward
all
day
over
barren
and
stony
hills
meeting
with
abundant
traces
of
the
power
and
prosperity
of
this
region
during
the
times
of
the
greek
emperors
the
nevastation
wrought
by
earthquakes
has
been
terrible
there
is
scarcely
a
wall
or
arch
standing
which
does
not
bear
marks
of
having
been
violently
shaken
the
walls
inclosing
the
near
the
villages
contain
many
stones
with
greek
inscriptions
and
fragments
of
cornices
we
encamped
the
first
night
on
the
plain
at
the
foot
of
mount
simon
and
not
far
from
the
ruins
of
the
celebrated
church
of
the
same
name
the
building
stands
in
a
stony
wilderness
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
it
is
about
a
hundred
feet
long
and
thirty
in
height
with
two
lofty
square
towers
in
front
the
pavement
of
the
interior
is
entirely
concealed
by
the
masses
of
pillars
capitals
and
hewn
blocks
that
lie
heaped
upon
it
the
windows
which
are
of
the
tall
narrow
arched
form
common
in
byzantine
churches
have
a
common
moulding
which
falls
like
a
mantle
over
and
between
them
the
general
effect
of
the
church
is
very
fine
though
there
is
much
inelegance
in
the
sculptured
details
at
the
extremity
is
a
of
massive
stone
over
the
place
of
the
altar
and
just
in
front
of
this
formerly
stood
the
pedestal
whereon
according
to
tradition
simeon
stylites
commenced
his
i
found
a
recent
excavation
at
the
spot
but
no
pedestal
which
has
probably
been
carried
off
by
the
greek
monks
beside
the
church
stands
a
large
building
with
an
upper
and
lower
balcony
supported
by
square
stone
pillars
around
three
sides
there
is
also
a
paved
a
large
cistern
cut
in
the
rock
and
numerous
all
going
to
confirm
the
supposition
of
its
having
been
a
monastery
the
main
building
is
three
stories
high
with
pointed
gables
and
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
an
american
summer
hotel
with
verandas
several
ancient
fig
and
walnut
trees
are
growing
among
the
ruins
and
add
to
their
picturesque
appearance
the
next
day
we
crossed
a
broad
chain
of
hills
to
the
plain
of
antioch
which
we
reached
near
its
northern
extremity
in
one
of
the
valleys
through
which
the
road
lay
we
saw
a
number
of
hot
sulphur
springs
some
of
them
of
a
considerable
volume
of
water
not
far
from
them
was
a
beautiful
fountain
of
fresh
and
cold
water
gushing
from
the
foot
of
a
high
rock
soon
after
reaching
the
plain
we
crossed
the
stream
of
kara
su
which
feeds
the
lake
of
antioch
this
part
of
the
plain
is
low
and
swampy
and
the
streams
are
literally
alive
with
fish
while
passing
over
the
bridge
i
saw
many
hundreds
from
one
to
two
feet
in
length
we
wandered
through
the
marshy
meadows
for
two
or
three
hours
and
towards
sunset
reached
a
turcoman
encampment
where
the
ground
was
dry
enough
to
pitch
our
tents
the
rude
tribe
received
us
hospitably
and
sent
us
milk
and
cheese
in
abundance
i
visited
the
tent
of
the
shekh
who
was
very
courteous
but
as
he
knew
no
language
but
turkish
our
conversation
was
restricted
to
signs
the
tent
was
of
cloth
spacious
and
open
at
the
sides
a
rug
was
spread
for
me
and
the
shekh
wife
brought
me
a
pipe
of
tolerable
tobacco
the
household
were
seated
upon
the
ground
chatting
pleasantly
with
one
another
and
apparently
not
in
the
least
disturbed
by
my
presence
one
of
the
shekh
sons
who
was
deaf
and
dumb
came
and
sat
before
me
and
described
by
very
expressive
signs
the
character
of
the
road
to
scanderoon
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
there
were
robbers
in
the
mountains
with
many
grim
gestures
descriptive
of
stabbing
and
firing
muskets
the
mosquitoes
were
so
thick
during
the
night
that
we
were
obliged
to
fill
the
tent
with
smoke
in
order
to
sleep
when
morning
came
we
fancied
there
would
be
a
relief
for
us
but
it
only
brought
a
worse
pest
in
the
shape
of
swarms
of
black
gnats
similar
to
those
which
so
tormented
me
in
nubia
i
know
of
no
infliction
so
terrible
as
these
gnats
which
you
can
not
drive
away
and
which
assail
ears
eyes
and
nostrils
in
such
quantities
that
you
become
mad
and
desperate
in
your
efforts
to
eject
them
through
glens
filled
with
oleander
we
ascended
the
first
slopes
of
akma
dagh
the
mountain
range
which
divides
the
gulf
of
scanderoon
from
the
plain
of
antioch
then
passing
a
natural
terrace
covered
with
groves
of
oak
our
road
took
the
mountain
side
climbing
upwards
in
the
shadow
of
pine
and
wild
olive
trees
and
between
banks
of
blooming
lavender
and
myrtle
we
saw
two
or
three
companies
of
armed
guards
stationed
by
the
for
the
mountain
is
infested
with
robbers
and
a
caravan
had
been
plundered
only
three
days
before
the
view
looking
backward
took
in
the
whole
plain
with
the
lake
of
antioch
glittering
in
the
centre
the
valley
of
the
orontes
in
the
south
and
the
lofty
cone
of
far
to
the
west
as
we
approached
the
summit
violent
gusts
of
wind
blew
through
the
pass
with
such
force
as
almost
to
overturn
our
horses
here
the
road
from
antioch
joins
that
from
aleppo
and
both
for
some
distance
retain
the
ancient
pavement
from
the
western
side
we
saw
the
sea
once
more
and
went
down
through
the
or
syrian
gates
as
this
defile
was
called
by
the
romans
it
is
very
narrow
and
rugged
with
an
abrupt
descent
in
an
hour
from
the
summit
we
came
upon
an
aqueduct
of
a
triple
row
of
arches
crossing
the
gorge
it
is
still
used
to
carry
water
to
the
town
of
beilan
which
hangs
over
the
mouth
of
the
pass
half
a
mile
below
this
is
one
of
the
most
picturesque
spots
in
syria
the
houses
cling
to
the
sides
and
cluster
on
the
summits
of
precipitous
crags
and
every
shelf
of
soil
every
crevice
where
a
tree
can
thrust
its
roots
upholds
a
mass
of
brilliant
vegetation
water
is
the
life
of
the
place
it
gushes
into
the
street
from
exhaustless
fountains
it
trickles
from
the
terraces
in
showers
of
misty
drops
it
tumbles
into
the
gorge
in
sparkling
streams
and
everywhere
it
nourishes
a
life
as
bright
and
beautiful
as
its
own
the
fruit
trees
are
of
enormous
size
and
the
crags
are
curtained
with
a
magnificent
drapery
of
vines
this
green
gateway
opens
suddenly
upon
another
cut
through
a
glittering
mass
of
micaceous
rock
whence
one
looks
down
on
the
town
and
gulf
of
scanderoon
the
coast
of
karamania
beyond
and
the
distant
snows
of
the
taurus
we
descended
through
groves
of
pine
and
oak
and
in
three
hours
more
reached
the
shore
scanderoon
is
the
most
unhealthy
place
on
the
syrian
coast
owing
to
the
malaria
from
a
marsh
behind
it
the
inhabitants
are
a
wretched
pallid
set
who
are
visited
every
year
with
devastating
fevers
the
marsh
was
partly
drained
some
forty
years
ago
by
the
turkish
government
and
a
few
thousand
dollars
would
be
sufficient
to
remove
it
entirely
and
make
the
place
which
is
of
some
importance
as
the
seaport
of
aleppo
healthy
and
habitable
at
present
there
are
not
five
hundred
inhabitants
and
half
of
these
consist
of
the
turkish
garrison
and
the
persons
attached
to
the
different
the
streets
are
depositories
of
filth
and
pools
of
stagnant
water
on
all
sides
exhale
the
most
fetid
odors
near
the
town
are
the
ruins
of
a
castle
built
by
godfrey
of
bouillon
we
marched
directly
down
to
the
and
pitched
our
tent
close
beside
the
waves
as
the
place
most
free
from
malaria
there
were
a
dozen
vessels
at
anchor
in
the
road
and
one
of
them
proved
to
be
the
american
bark
columbia
capt
taylor
we
took
a
skiff
and
went
on
board
where
we
were
cordially
welcomed
by
the
mate
in
the
evening
the
captain
came
to
our
tent
quite
surprised
to
find
two
wandering
americans
in
such
a
lonely
corner
of
the
world
soon
afterwards
with
true
generosity
he
returned
bringing
a
jar
of
fine
spanish
olives
and
a
large
bottle
of
pickles
which
he
insisted
on
adding
to
our
supplies
the
olives
have
the
choicest
andalusian
flavor
and
the
pickles
lose
none
of
their
relish
from
having
been
put
up
in
new
york
the
road
from
scanderoon
to
this
place
lies
mostly
along
the
shore
of
the
gulf
at
the
foot
of
akma
dagh
and
is
reckoned
dangerous
on
account
of
the
marauding
bands
of
koords
who
infest
the
mountains
these
people
like
the
druses
have
rebelled
against
the
conscription
and
will
probably
hold
their
ground
with
equal
success
though
the
turks
talk
loudly
of
invading
their
strongholds
two
weeks
ago
the
post
was
robbed
about
ten
miles
from
scanderoon
and
a
government
vessel
now
lying
at
anchor
in
the
bay
opened
a
cannonade
on
the
plunderers
before
they
could
be
secured
in
consequence
of
the
warnings
of
danger
in
everybody
mouth
we
decided
to
take
an
escort
and
therefore
waited
upon
the
commander
of
the
forces
with
the
firman
of
the
pasha
of
aleppo
a
convoy
of
two
soldiers
was
at
once
promised
us
and
at
sunrise
next
morning
they
took
the
lead
of
our
caravan
in
order
to
appear
more
formidable
in
case
we
should
meet
with
robbers
we
put
on
our
frank
pantaloons
which
had
no
other
effect
than
to
make
the
heat
more
intolerable
but
we
formed
rather
a
fierce
cavalcade
six
armed
men
in
all
our
road
followed
the
shore
of
the
bay
having
a
narrow
uninhabited
flat
covered
with
thickets
of
myrtle
and
mastic
between
us
and
the
mountains
the
two
soldiers
more
valiant
than
the
guard
of
banias
rode
in
advance
and
showed
no
signs
of
fear
as
we
approached
the
suspicious
places
the
morning
was
delightfully
clear
and
the
range
of
taurus
shone
through
the
soft
vapors
hanging
over
the
gulf
in
one
place
we
skirted
the
shore
for
some
distance
under
a
bank
twenty
feet
in
height
and
so
completely
mantled
with
shrubbery
that
a
small
army
might
have
hidden
in
it
there
were
gulleys
at
intervals
opening
suddenly
on
our
path
and
we
looked
up
them
expecting
every
moment
to
see
the
gleam
of
a
koordish
or
a
turcoman
spear
above
the
tops
of
the
myrtles
crossing
a
promontory
which
makes
out
from
the
mountains
we
came
upon
the
renowned
plain
of
issus
where
darius
lost
his
kingdom
to
alexander
on
a
low
cliff
overhanging
the
sea
there
are
the
remains
of
a
single
tower
of
gray
stone
the
people
in
scanderoon
call
it
jonah
pillar
and
say
that
it
marks
the
spot
where
the
ninevite
was
cast
ashore
by
the
whale
this
makes
three
places
on
the
syrian
coast
where
jonah
was
vomited
forth
the
plain
of
issus
is
from
two
to
three
miles
long
but
not
more
than
half
a
mile
wide
it
is
traversed
by
a
little
river
supposed
to
be
the
pinarus
which
comes
down
through
a
tremendous
cleft
in
the
akma
dagh
the
ground
seems
too
small
for
the
of
such
armies
as
were
engaged
on
the
occasion
it
is
bounded
on
the
north
by
a
low
hill
separating
it
from
the
plain
of
baïas
and
it
is
possible
that
alexander
may
have
made
choice
of
this
position
leaving
the
unwieldy
forces
of
darius
to
attack
him
from
the
plain
his
advantage
would
be
greater
on
account
of
the
long
narrow
form
of
the
ground
which
would
prevent
him
from
being
engaged
with
more
than
a
small
portion
of
the
persian
army
at
one
time
the
plain
is
now
roseate
with
blooming
oleanders
but
almost
entirely
uncultivated
about
midway
there
are
the
remains
of
an
ancient
quay
jutting
into
the
sea
soon
after
leaving
the
field
of
issus
we
reached
the
town
of
baïas
which
is
pleasantly
situated
on
the
shore
at
the
mouth
of
a
river
whose
course
through
the
plain
is
marked
with
rows
of
tall
poplar
trees
the
walls
of
the
town
and
the
white
dome
and
minaret
of
its
mosque
rose
dazzlingly
against
the
dark
blue
of
the
sea
and
the
purple
stretch
of
the
mountains
of
karamania
a
single
palm
lifted
its
crest
in
the
foreground
we
dismounted
for
breakfast
under
the
shade
of
an
old
bridge
which
crosses
the
river
it
was
a
charming
spot
the
banks
above
and
below
being
overhung
with
oleander
white
rose
honeysuckle
and
clematis
the
two
guardsmen
finished
the
remaining
half
of
our
turcoman
cheese
and
almost
exhausted
our
supply
of
bread
i
gave
one
of
them
a
cigar
which
he
was
at
a
loss
how
to
smoke
until
our
muleteer
showed
him
baïas
was
celebrated
fifty
years
ago
as
the
residence
of
the
robber
chief
kutchuk
ali
who
for
a
long
time
braved
the
authority
of
the
porte
itself
he
was
in
the
habit
of
levying
a
yearly
tribute
on
the
caravan
to
mecca
and
the
better
to
enforce
his
claims
often
suspended
two
or
three
of
his
captives
at
the
gates
of
the
town
a
day
or
two
before
the
caravan
arrived
several
expeditions
were
sent
against
him
but
he
always
succeeded
in
bribing
the
commanders
who
on
their
return
to
constantinople
made
such
representations
that
kutchuk
ali
instead
of
being
punished
received
one
dignity
after
another
until
finally
he
attained
the
rank
of
a
pasha
of
two
tails
this
emboldened
him
to
commit
enormities
too
great
to
be
overlooked
and
in
baïas
was
taken
and
the
atrocious
nest
of
broken
up
i
knew
that
the
town
had
been
sacked
on
this
occasion
but
was
not
prepared
to
find
such
a
complete
picture
of
desolation
the
place
is
surrounded
with
a
substantial
wall
with
two
gateways
on
the
north
and
south
a
bazaar
covered
with
a
lofty
vaulted
roof
of
stone
runs
directly
through
from
gate
to
gate
and
there
was
still
a
smell
of
spices
in
the
air
on
entering
the
massive
shops
on
either
hand
with
their
open
doors
invited
possession
and
might
readily
be
made
habitable
again
the
great
iron
gates
leading
from
the
bazaar
into
the
khans
and
courts
still
swing
on
their
rusty
hinges
we
rode
into
the
court
of
the
mosque
which
is
surrounded
with
a
light
and
elegant
corridor
supported
by
pillars
the
grass
has
as
yet
but
partially
invaded
the
marble
pavement
and
a
stone
still
stands
in
the
centre
i
urged
my
horse
up
the
steps
and
into
the
door
of
the
mosque
it
is
in
the
form
of
a
greek
cross
with
a
dome
in
the
centre
resting
on
four
very
elegant
pointed
arches
there
is
an
elaborately
gilded
and
painted
gallery
of
wood
over
the
entrance
and
the
pulpit
opposite
is
as
well
preserved
as
if
the
had
just
left
it
out
of
the
mosque
we
passed
into
a
second
court
and
then
over
a
narrow
bridge
into
the
fortress
the
moat
is
perfect
and
the
walls
as
complete
as
if
just
erected
only
the
bottom
is
dry
and
now
covered
with
a
thicket
of
wild
pomegranate
trees
the
heavy
iron
doors
of
the
fortress
swung
half
open
as
we
entered
unchallenged
the
interior
is
almost
entire
and
some
of
the
cannon
still
lie
buried
in
the
springing
grass
the
plan
of
the
little
town
which
appears
to
have
been
all
built
at
one
time
is
most
admirable
the
walls
of

including
the

can
not
be
more
than

square
and
yet
none
of
the
characteristics
of

are
omitted
leaving

we
travelled
northward
over
a
waste
though

the
mountains
on
our
right
made
a
grand
appearance
with
their
feet
mantled
in

and
their
tops
plumed
with
pine
they
rise
from
the
sea
with
a
long
bold
sweep
but
each
peak
falls
off
in
a
precipice
on
the
opposite
side
as
if
the
chain
were
the
barrier
of
the
world
and
there
was
nothing
but
space
beyond
in
the
afternoon
we
left
the
plain
for
a
belt
of
glorious
garden
land
made
by
streams
that
came
down
from
the

we
entered

embowered
in

and
shrubs
and
overarched
by
superb
plane

and

chained
together
with

on

side
were

of

and

of
fruit

under
the
shade
of
which
the
turkish
families
sat
or
slept
during
the
hot
hours
of
the
day
birds
sang
in

and
the
gurgling
of
water
made
a

undertone
to
their
music
out

we
were
glad
when
the
soldiers
announced
that
it
was
necessary
to
encamp
there
as
we
should
find
no

habitations
for
more
than
twenty
miles
our

which
almost
made
the

was
originally
intended
for
a
magazine
of
supplies
and
from
the
ruined
mosque
near
it
i
suspect
it
was
formerly
one
of
the
caravan
stations
for
the
pilgrims
from
constantinople
to
mecca
the
weather
was
intensely
hot
and
sultry
and
our
animals
were
almost
crazy
from
the
attacks
of
a
large
yellow
after
the
noonday
heat
was
over
we
descended
to
the
first
cilician
plain
which
is
bounded
on
the
west
by
the
range
of
durdun
dagh
as
we
had
now
passed
the
most
dangerous
part
of
the
road
we
dismissed
the
three
soldiers
and
took
but
a
single
man
with
us
the
entire
plain
is
covered
with
wild
fennel
six
to
eight
feet
in
height
and
literally
blazing
with
its
bloomy
yellow
tops
riding
through
it
i
could
barely
look
over
them
and
far
and
wide
on
all
sides
spread
a
golden
sea
out
of
which
the
long
violet
hills
rose
with
the
liveliest
effect
brown
shining
serpents
from
four
to
six
feet
in
length
frequently
slid
across
our
path
the
plain
which
must
be
sixty
miles
in
circumference
is
wholly
uncultivated
though
no
land
could
possibly
be
richer
out
of
the
region
of
fennel
we
passed
into
one
of
red
and
white
clover
timothy
grass
and
wild
oats
the
thistles
were
so
large
as
to
resemble
young
and
the
salsify
of
our
gardens
grew
rank
and
wild
at
length
we
dipped
into
the
evening
shadow
of
durdun
dagh
and
reached
the
village
of
koord
keui
on
his
lower
slope
as
there
was
no
place
for
our
tent
on
the
rank
grass
of
the
plain
or
the
steep
side
of
the
hill
we
took
forcible
possession
of
the
a
flat
terrace
built
up
under
two
sycamores
and
still
covered
with
the
chaff
of
the
last
threshing
the
koords
took
the
whole
thing
as
a
matter
of
course
and
even
brought
us
a
felt
carpet
to
rest
upon
they
came
and
seated
themselves
around
us
chatting
sociably
while
we
lay
in
the
smoking
the
pipe
of
refreshment
the
view
over
the
wide
golden
plain
and
the
hills
beyond
to
the
distant
peaks
of
akma
dagh
was
superb
as
the
shadow
of
the
mountain
behind
us
slowly
lengthened
over
it
blotting
out
the
mellow
lights
of
sunset
there
were
many
fragments
of
pillars
and
capitals
of
white
marble
built
up
in
the
houses
showing
that
they
occupied
the
site
of
some
ancient
village
or
temple
the
next
morning
we
crossed
durdun
dagh
and
entered
the
great
plain
of
cilicia
the
range
after
we
had
passed
it
presented
a
grand
bold
broken
outline
blue
in
the
morning
vapor
and
wreathed
with
shifting
belts
of
cloud
a
stately
castle
called
the
palace
of
serpents
on
the
summit
of
an
isolated
peak
to
the
north
stood
out
clear
and
high
in
the
midst
of
a
circle
of
fog
like
a
phantom
picture
of
the
air
the
river
jyhoon
the
ancient
pyramus
which
rises
on
the
borders
of
armenia
sweeps
the
western
base
of
the
mountains
it
is
a
larger
stream
than
the
orontes
with
a
deep
rapid
current
flowing
at
the
bottom
of
a
bed
lower
than
the
level
of
the
plain
in
three
hours
we
reached
missis
the
ancient
mopsuestia
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
there
are
extensive
ruins
on
the
left
bank
which
were
probably
those
of
the
former
city
the
soil
for
some
distance
around
is
scattered
with
broken
pillars
capitals
and
hewn
stones
the
ancient
bridge
still
crosses
the
river
but
the
central
arch
having
been
broken
away
is
replaced
with
a
wooden
platform
the
modern
town
is
a
forlorn
place
and
all
the
glorious
plain
around
it
is
uncultivated
the
view
over
this
plain
was
magnificent
unbounded
towards
the
sea
but
on
the
north
girdled
by
the
sublime
range
of
taurus
whose
great
gleamed
in
the
sun
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
the
old
bridge
over
the
jyhoon
at
adana
the
eastern
bank
is
occupied
with
the
graves
of
the
former
inhabitants
and
there
are
at
least
fifteen
acres
of
tombstones
as
thickly
planted
as
the
graves
can
be
dug
the
fields
of
wheat
and
barley
along
the
river
are
very
rich
and
at
present
the
natives
are
busily
occupied
in
drawing
the
sheaves
on
large
sleds
to
the
open
the
city
is
built
over
a
low
eminence
and
its
four
tall
minarets
with
a
number
of
rising
from
the
mass
of
brown
brick
walls
reminded
me
of
egypt
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
we
were
met
by
one
of
the
quarantine
officers
who
preceded
us
taking
care
that
we
touched
nobody
in
the
streets
to
the
quarantine
building
this
land
quarantine
between
syria
and
asia
minor
when
the
former
country
is
free
from
any
epidemic
seems
a
most
absurd
thing
we
were
detained
at
adana
three
days
and
a
half
to
be
purified
before
proceeding
further
lately
the
whole
town
was
placed
in
quarantine
for
five
days
because
a
turkish
bey
who
lives
near
baïas
entered
the
gates
without
being
noticed
and
was
found
in
the
bazaars
the
quarantine
building
was
once
a
palace
of
the
pashas
of
adana
but
is
now
in
a
condition
the
rooms
are
large
and
airy
and
there
is
a
spacious
open
divan
which
affords
ample
shade
and
a
cool
breeze
throughout
the
whole
day
fortunately
for
us
there
were
only
three
persons
in
quarantine
who
occupied
a
room
distant
from
ours
the
inspector
was
a
very
obliging
person
and
procured
us
a
table
and
two
chairs
the
only
table
to
be
had
in
the
whole
place
a
town
of
inhabitants
belonged
to
an
italian
merchant
who
kindly
gave
it
for
our
use
we
employed
a
messenger
to
purchase
provisions
in
the
bazaars
and
our
days
passed
quietly
in
writing
smoking
and
gazing
indolently
from
our
windows
upon
the
flowery
plains
beyond
the
town
our
nights
however
were
tormented
by
small
white
gnats
which
stung
us
unmercifully
the
physician
of
quarantine
spagnolo
is
a
venetian
refugee
and
formerly
editor
of
lega
a
paper
published
in
venice
during
the
revolution
he
informed
us
that
except
the
princess
belgioioso
who
passed
through
adana
on
her
way
to
jerusalem
we
were
the
only
travellers
he
had
seen
for
eleven
months
after
three
days
and
four
nights
of
grateful
because
involuntary
indolence
spagnolo
gave
us
and
we
lost
no
time
in
getting
under
weigh
again
we
were
the
only
occupants
of
quarantine
and
as
we
moved
out
of
the
portal
of
the
old
seraï
at
sunrise
no
one
was
guarding
it
the
inspector
and
mustapha
the
messenger
took
their
with
silent
gratitude
the
plain
on
the
west
side
of
the
town
is
well
cultivated
and
as
we
rode
along
towards
tarsus
i
was
charmed
with
the
rich
pastoral
air
of
the
scenery
it
was
like
one
of
the
midland
landscapes
of
england
bathed
in
southern
sunshine
the
beautiful
level
stretching
away
to
the
mountains
stood
golden
with
the
fields
of
wheat
which
the
reapers
were
cutting
it
was
no
longer
bare
but
dotted
with
orange
groves
clumps
of
holly
and
a
number
of
magnificent
whose
dark
rounded
masses
of
foliage
remind
one
of
the
northern
oak
cattle
were
grazing
in
the
stubble
and
horses
almost
buried
under
loads
of
fresh
grass
met
us
as
they
passed
to
the
city
the
sheaves
were
drawn
to
the
on
sleds
and
we
could
see
the
husbandmen
in
the
distance
treading
out
and
winnowing
the
grain
over
these
bright
busy
scenes
rose
the
lesser
heights
of
the
taurus
and
beyond
them
mingled
in
white
clouds
the
snows
of
the
crowning
range
the
road
to
tarsus
which
is
eight
hours
distant
lies
over
an
unbroken
plain
towards
the
sea
there
are
two
tumuli
resembling
those
on
the
plains
east
of
antioch
stone
wells
with
troughs
for
watering
horses
occur
at
intervals
of
three
or
four
miles
but
there
is
little
cultivation
after
leaving
the
vicinity
of
adana
the
sun
poured
down
an
intense
summer
heat
and
hundreds
of
large
swarming
around
us
drove
the
horses
wild
with
their
stings
towards
noon
we
stopped
at
a
little
village
for
breakfast
we
took
possession
of
a
shop
which
the
merchant
offered
us
and
were
about
to
spread
our
provisions
upon
the
counter
when
the
gnats
and
mosquitoes
fairly
drove
us
away
we
at
once
went
forward
in
search
of
a
better
place
which
gave
occasion
to
our
chief
mukkairee
hadji
youssuf
for
a
violent
remonstrance
the
terms
of
the
agreement
at
aleppo
gave
the
entire
control
of
the
journey
into
our
own
hands
and
the
hadji
now
sought
to
violate
it
he
protested
against
our
travelling
more
than
six
hours
a
day
and
conducted
himself
so
insolently
that
we
threatened
to
take
him
before
the
pasha
of
tarsus
this
silenced
him
for
the
time
but
we
hate
him
so
cordially
since
then
that
i
foresee
we
shall
have
more
trouble
in
the
afternoon
a
gust
sweeping
along
the
sides
of
taurus
cooled
the
air
and
afforded
us
a
little
relief
by
three
we
reached
the
river
cydnus
which
is
bare
of
trees
on
its
eastern
side
but
flows
between
banks
covered
with
grass
and
shrubs
it
is
still
spanned
by
the
ancient
bridge
and
the
mules
now
step
in
the
hollow
ruts
worn
long
ago
by
roman
and
byzantine
chariot
wheels
the
stream
is
not
more
than
thirty
yards
broad
but
has
a
very
full
and
rapid
current
of
a
color
from
the
snows
which
feed
it
i
rode
down
to
the
brink
and
drank
a
cup
of
the
water
it
was
exceedingly
cold
and
i
do
not
wonder
that
a
bath
in
it
should
have
killed
the
emperor
barbarossa
from
the
top
of
the
bridge
there
is
a
lovely
view
down
the
stream
where
it
washes
a
fringe
of
willows
and
heavy
on
its
western
bank
and
then
winds
away
through
the
grassy
plain
to
the
sea
for
once
my
fancy
ran
parallel
with
the
inspiration
of
the
scene
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
galley
of
cleopatra
slowly
stemming
the
current
of
the
stream
its
silken
sails
filled
with
the
its
gilded
oars
keeping
time
to
the
flutes
whose
voluptuous
melodies
floated
far
out
over
the
vernal
meadows
tarsus
was
probably
almost
hidden
then
as
now
by
its
gardens
except
just
where
it
touched
the
river
and
the
dazzling
vision
of
the
egyptian
queen
as
she
came
up
conquering
and
to
conquer
must
have
been
all
the
more
bewildering
from
the
lovely
bowers
through
which
she
sailed
from
the
bridge
an
ancient
road
still
leads
to
the
old
byzantine
gate
of
tarsus
part
of
the
town
is
encompassed
by
a
wall
built
by
the
caliph
haroun
and
there
is
a
ruined
fortress
which
is
attributed
to
sultan
bajazet
small
streams
brought
from
the
cydnus
traverse
the
environs
and
with
such
a
fertile
soil
the
luxuriance
of
the
gardens
in
which
the
city
lies
buried
is
almost
incredible
in
our
rambles
in
search
of
a
place
to
pitch
the
tent
we
entered
a
superb
the
foliage
of
which
made
a
perpetual
twilight
many
of
the
trunks
were
two
feet
in
diameter
the
houses
are
mostly
of
one
story
and
the
materials
are
almost
wholly
borrowed
from
the
ancient
city
pillars
capitals
fragments
of
cornices
and
entablatures
abound
i
noticed
here
as
in
adana
a
high
wooden
frame
on
the
top
of
every
house
raised
a
few
steps
above
the
roof
and
covered
with
light
muslin
like
a
portable
here
the
people
put
up
their
beds
in
the
evening
sleep
and
come
down
to
the
roofs
in
the
morning
an
excellent
plan
for
getting
better
air
in
these
malarious
plains
and
escaping
from
fleas
and
mosquitoes
in
our
search
for
the
armenian
church
which
is
said
to
have
been
founded
by
paul
saul
of
tarsus
we
came
upon
a
mosque
which
had
been
originally
a
christian
church
of
greek
times
from
the
top
of
a
mound
whereupon
stand
the
remains
of
an
ancient
circular
edifice
we
obtained
a
fine
view
of
the
city
and
plain
of
tarsus
a
few
houses
or
clusters
of
houses
stood
here
and
there
like
reefs
amid
the
billowy
green
and
the
minarets
one
of
them
with
a
nest
of
young
storks
on
its
very
summit
rose
like
the
masts
of
sunken
ships
some
palms
lifted
their
tufted
heads
from
the
gardens
beyond
which
the
great
plain
extended
from
the
mountains
to
the
sea
the
tumulus
near
mersyn
the
port
of
tarsus
was
plainly
visible
two
hours
from
mersyn
are
the
ruins
of
pompeiopolis
the
name
given
by
pompey
to
the
town
of
soli
after
his
conquest
of
the
cilician
pirates
from
soli
on
account
of
the
bad
greek
spoken
by
its
inhabitants
came
the
term
solecism
the
ruins
of
pompeiopolis
consist
of
a
theatre
temples
and
a
number
of
houses
still
in
good
preservation
the
whole
coast
as
far
as
aleya
three
hundred
miles
west
of
this
is
said
to
abound
with
ruined
cities
and
i
regret
exceedingly
that
time
will
not
permit
me
to
explore
it
while
searching
for
the
antiquities
about
tarsus
i
accosted
a
man
in
a
frank
dress
who
proved
to
be
the
neapolitan
consul
he
told
us
that
the
most
remarkable
relic
was
the
the
round
stone
and
procured
us
a
guide
it
lies
in
a
garden
near
the
city
and
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
remarkable
monuments
in
the
east
it
consists
of
a
square
inclosure
of
solid
masonry
feet
long
by
feet
wide
the
walls
of
which
are
eighteen
feet
in
thickness
and
twenty
feet
high
it
appears
to
have
been
originally
a
solid
mass
without
entrance
but
a
passage
has
been
broken
in
one
place
and
in
another
there
is
a
split
or
fissure
evidently
produced
by
an
earthquake
the
material
is
rough
stone
brick
and
mortar
inside
of
the
inclosure
are
two
detached
square
masses
of
masonry
of
equal
height
and
probably
eighty
feet
on
a
side
without
opening
of
any
kind
one
of
them
has
been
pierced
at
the
bottom
a
steep
passage
leading
to
a
pit
or
well
but
the
sides
of
the
passage
thus
broken
indicate
that
the
whole
structure
is
one
solid
mass
it
is
generally
supposed
that
they
were
intended
as
tombs
but
of
whom
there
is
no
sign
by
which
they
may
be
recognized
and
what
is
more
singular
no
tradition
concerning
them
the
day
we
reached
tarsus
was
the
first
of
the
turkish
of
ramazan
the
inhabitants
having
seen
the
new
moon
the
night
before
at
adana
where
they
did
not
keep
such
a
close
the
fast
had
not
commenced
during
its
continuance
which
is
from
to
days
no
mussulman
dares
eat
drink
or
smoke
from
an
hour
before
sunrise
till
half
an
hour
after
sunset
the
mohammedan
months
are
lunar
and
each
month
makes
the
whole
round
of
the
seasons
once
in
years
when
therefore
the
ramazan
comes
in
midsummer
as
at
present
the
fulfilment
of
this
fast
is
a
great
trial
even
to
the
strongest
and
most
devout
eighteen
hours
without
meat
or
drink
and
what
is
still
worse
to
a
genuine
turk
without
a
pipe
is
a
rigid
test
of
faith
the
rich
do
the
best
they
can
to
avoid
it
by
feasting
all
night
and
sleeping
all
day
but
the
poor
who
must
perform
their
daily
avocations
as
usual
suffer
exceedingly
in
walking
through
tarsus
i
saw
many
wretched
faces
in
the
bazaars
and
the
guide
who
accompanied
us
had
a
painfully
famished
air
fortunately
the
koran
expressly
permits
invalids
children
and
travellers
to
disregard
the
fast
so
that
although
we
eat
and
drink
when
we
like
we
are
none
the
less
looked
upon
as
good
mussulmans
about
dark
a
gun
is
fired
and
a
rocket
sent
up
from
the
mosque
announcing
the
termination
of
the
day
fast
the
meals
are
already
prepared
the
pipes
filled
the
coffee
smokes
in
the
and
the
echoes
have
not
died
away
nor
the
last
sparks
of
the
rocket
become
extinct
before
half
the
inhabitants
are

we
again
crossed

and
took
a
northern
course
across
the
plain
the
long
line
of
taurus
rose
before
us
seemingly
divided
into
four
successive
ranges
the
highest
of
which
was
folded
in
clouds
only
the
long
streaks
of
snow
filling
the
ravines
being
visible
the
outlines
of
these
ranges
were
very
fine
the
waving
line
of
the
summits
cut
here
and
there
by
precipitous
gorges
the
gateways
of
rivers
that
came
down
to
the
plain
in
about
two
hours
we
entered
the
lower
hills
they
are
barren
and
stony
with
a
white
chalky
soil
but
the
valleys
were
filled
with
myrtle
oleander
and
lauristinus
in
bloom
and
lavender
grew
in
great
profusion
on
the
the
flowers
of
the
oleander
gave
out
a
delicate
fragrance
and
grew
in
such
dense
clusters
as
frequently
to
hide
the
foliage
i
amused
myself
with
finding
a
derivation
of
the
name
of
this
beautiful
plant
which
may
answer
until
somebody
discovers
a
better
one
hero
when
the
corpse
of
her
lover
was
cast
ashore
by
the
waves
buried
him
under
an
oleander
bush
where
she
was
accustomed
to
sit
daily
and
lament
over
his
untimely
fate
now
a
foreign
horticulturist
happening
to
pass
by
when
the
shrub
was
in
blossom
was
much
struck
with
its
beauty
and
asked
hero
what
it
was
called
but
she
absorbed
in
grief
and
thinking
only
of
her
lover
clasped
her
hands
and
sighed
out
o
leander
o
leander
which
the
horticulturist
immediately
entered
in
his
as
the
name
of
the
shrub
and
by
that
name
it
is
known
to
the
present
time
for
two
or
three
hours
the
scenery
was
rather
tame
the
higher
summits
being
obscured
with
a
towards
noon
however
we
passed
the
first
chain
and
saw
across
a
strip
of
rolling
land
intervening
the
grand
ramparts
of
the
second
looming
dark
and
large
under
the
clouds
a
circular
of
white
stone
standing
on
the
summit
of
a
promontory
at
the
mouth
of
a
gorge
on
our
right
flashed
out
boldly
against
the
storm
we
stopped
under
an
to
take
breakfast
but
there
was
no
water
and
two
turks
who
were
resting
while
their
horses
grazed
in
the
meadow
told
us
we
should
find
a
good
spring
half
a
mile
further
we
ascended
a
long
slope
covered
with
where
numbers
of
turcoman
reapers
were
busy
at
work
passed
their
black
tents
surrounded
with
droves
of
sheep
and
goats
and
reached
a
rude
stone
fountain
of
good
water
where
two
companies
of
these
people
had
stopped
to
rest
on
their
way
to
the
mountains
it
was
the
time
of
noon
prayer
and
they
went
through
their
devotions
with
great
solemnity
we
nestled
deep
in
a
bed
of
myrtles
while
we
breakfasted
for
the
sky
was
clouded
and
the
wind
blew
cool
and
fresh
from
the
region
of
rain
above
us
some
of
the
turcomans
asked
us
for
bread
and
were
very
grateful
when
we
gave
it
to
them
in
the
afternoon
we
came
into
a
higher
and
wilder
region
where
the
road
led
through
thickets
of
wild
olive
holly
oak
and
lauristinus
with
occasional
groves
of
pine
what
a
joy
i
felt
in
hearing
once
more
the
grand
song
of
my
favorite
tree
our
way
was
a
woodland
road
a
storm
had
passed
over
the
region
in
the
morning
the
earth
was
still
fresh
and
moist
and
there
was
an
aromatic
smell
of
leaves
in
the
air
we
turned
westward
into
the
entrance
of
a
deep
valley
over
which
hung
a
perpendicular
cliff
of
gray
and
red
rock
fashioned
by
nature
so
as
to
resemble
a
vast
fortress
with
windows
portals
and
projecting
bastions
françois
displayed
his
knowledge
of
mythology
by
declaring
it
to
be
the
palace
of
pan
while
we
were
carrying
out
the
idea
by
making
chambers
for
the
fauns
and
nymphs
in
the
basement
story
of
the
precipice
the
path
wound
around
the
shoulder
of
the
mountain
and
the
glen
spread
away
before
us
branching
up
into
loftier
ranges
disclosing
through
its
gateway
of
cliffs
rising
out
of
the
steeps
of
pine
forest
a
sublime
vista
of
blue
mountain
peaks
climbing
to
the
topmost
snows
it
was
a
magnificent
alpine
landscape
more
glowing
and
rich
than
switzerland
yet
equalling
it
in
all
the
loftier
characteristics
of
mountain
scenery
another
and
greater
precipice
towered
over
us
on
the
right
and
the
black
eagles
which
had
made
their
eyries
in
its
niched
and
caverned
vaults
were
wheeling
around
its
crest
a
branch
of
the
cydnus
foamed
along
the
bottom
of
the
gorge
and
soma
turcoman
boys
were
tending
their
herds
on
its
banks
further
up
the
glen
we
found
a
fountain
of
delicious
water
beside
the
deserted
khan
of
mezarluk
and
there
encamped
for
the
night
our
tent
was
pitched
on
the
mountain
side
near
a
fountain
of
the
coolest
clearest
and
sweetest
water
i
have
seen
in
all
the
east
there
was
perfect
silence
among
the
mountains
and
the
place
was
as
lonely
as
it
was
sublime
the
night
was
cool
and
fresh
but
i
could
not
sleep
until
towards
morning
when
i
opened
my
belated
eyes
the
tall
peaks
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
glen
were
girdled
below
their
waists
with
the
flood
of
a
sparkling
sunrise
the
sky
was
pure
as
crystal
except
a
soft
white
fleece
that
veiled
the
snowy
pinnacles
of
taurus
folding
and
unfolding
rising
and
sinking
as
if
to
make
their
beauty
still
more
attractive
by
the
partial
concealment
the
morning
air
was
almost
cold
but
so
pure
and
bracing
so
aromatic
with
the
healthy
breath
of
the
pines
that
i
took
it
down
in
the
fullest
possible
draughts
we
rode
up
the
glen
following
the
course
of
the
cydnus
through
scenery
of
the
wildest
and
most
romantic
character
the
bases
of
the
mountains
were
completely
enveloped
in
forests
of
pine
but
their
summits
rose
in
precipitous
crags
many
hundreds
of
feet
in
height
hanging
above
our
very
heads
even
after
the
sun
was
five
hours
high
their
shadows
fell
upon
us
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
glen
mixed
with
the
pine
were
occasional
oaks
an
undergrowth
of
hawthorn
in
bloom
and
shrubs
covered
with
yellow
and
white
flowers
over
these
the
wild
grape
threw
its
rich
festoons
filling
the
air
with
exquisite
fragrance
out
of
this
glen
we
passed
into
another
still
narrower
and
wilder
the
road
was
the
old
roman
way
and
in
tolerable
condition
though
it
had
evidently
not
been
mended
for
many
centuries
in
half
an
hour
the
pass
opened
disclosing
an
enormous
peak
in
front
of
us
crowned
with
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
fortress
of
considerable
extent
the
position
was
almost
impregnable
the
mountain
dropping
on
one
side
into
a
precipice
five
hundred
feet
in
perpendicular
height
under
the
cliffs
of
the
loftiest
ridge
there
was
a
terrace
planted
with
a
charming
little
hamlet
in
the
wilderness
wild
with
white
trunks
and
bright
green
foliage
shaded
the
foamy
twists
of
the
cydnus
as
it
plunged
down
its
difficult
bed
the
pine
thrust
its
roots
into
the
naked
precipices
and
from
their
summits
hung
out
over
the
great
abysses
below
i
thought
of
tall
dark
pines
that
fringed
the
craggy
ledge
high
over
the
blue
gorge
and
all
between
the
snowy
peak
and
cataract
fostered
the
callow
eaglet
and
certainly
she
had
on
mount
ida
no
more
beautiful
trees
than
these
we
had
doubled
the
crag
of
the
fortress
when
the
pass
closed
before
us
shut
in
by
two
immense
precipices
of
sheer
barren
rock
more
than
a
thousand
feet
in
height
vast
fragments
fallen
from
above
choked
up
the
entrance
whence
the
cydnus
spouting
forth
in
foam
leaped
into
the
defile
the
ancient
road
was
completely
destroyed
but
traces
of
it
were
to
be
seen
on
the
rocks
ten
feet
above
the
present
bed
of
the
stream
and
on
the
broken
masses
which
had
been
hurled
below
the
path
wound
with
difficulty
among
these
wrecks
and
then
merged
into
the
stream
itself
as
we
entered
the
gateway
a
violent
wind
blew
in
our
faces
as
we
rode
through
the
strait
which
is
not
ten
yards
in
breadth
while
its
walls
rise
to
the
region
of
the
clouds
in
a
few
minutes
we
had
traversed
it
and
stood
looking
back
on
the
enormous
gap
there
were
several
greek
tablets
cut
in
the
rock
above
the
old
road
but
so
defaced
as
to
be
illegible
this
is
undoubtedly
the
principal
gate
of
the
taurus
and
the
pass
through
which
the
armies
of
cyrus
and
alexander
entered
cilicia
beyond
the
gate
the
mountains
retreated
and
we
climbed
up
a
little
dell
past
two
or
three
turcoman
houses
to
the
top
of
a
hill
whence
opened
a
view
of
the
principal
range
now
close
at
hand
the
mountains
in
front
were
clothed
with
dark
cedars
to
their
very
tops
and
the
behind
them
seemed
dazzlingly
bright
and
near
our
course
for
several
miles
now
lay
through
a
more
open
valley
drained
by
the
upper
waters
of
the
cydnus
on
two
opposing
terraces
of
the
mountain
chains
are
two
fortresses
built
by
ibraham
pasha
but
now
wholly
deserted
they
are
large
and
works
of
stone
and
surrounded
by
ruins
of
stables
ovens
and
the
rude
houses
of
the
soldiery
passing
between
these
we
ascended
to
the
shelf
dividing
the
waters
of
the
cydnus
and
the
sihoon
from
the
point
where
the
slope
descends
to
the
latter
river
there
opened
before
me
one
of
the
most
glorious
landscapes
i
ever
beheld
i
stood
at
the
extremity
of
a
long
hollow
or
depression
between
the
two
ranges
of
the
taurus
not
a
valley
for
it
was
divided
by
deep
cloven
chasms
hemmed
in
by
steeps
overgrown
with
cedars
on
my
right
rose
a
sublime
chain
soaring
far
out
of
the
region
of
trees
and
lifting
its
peaked
summits
of
gray
rock
into
toe
sky
another
chain
nearly
as
lofty
but
not
so
broken
nor
with
such
large
imposing
features
overhung
me
on
the
left
and
far
in
front
filling
up
the
magnificent
vista
filling
up
all
between
the
lower
steeps
crowned
with
pine
and
the
round
white
clouds
hanging
on
the
verge
of
heaven
were
the
shining
snows
of
the
taurus
great
god
how
shall
i
describe
the
grandeur
of
that
view
how
draw
the
wonderful
outlines
of
those
mountains
how
paint
the
airy
hue
of
the
soft
white
lights
the
thousandfold
pencillings
of
mellow
shadow
the
height
the
depth
the
vastness
of
the
landscape
in
the
middle
distance
a
great
blue
gorge
passed
transversely
across
the
two
ranges
and
the
region
between
this
as
i
rightly
conjectured
was
the
bed
of
the
sihoon
our
road
led
downward
through
groves
of
fragrant
cedars
and
we
travelled
thus
for
two
hours
before
reaching
the
river
taking
a
northward
course
up
his
banks
we
reached
the
second
of
the
before
sunset
it
is
on
a
grander
scale
than
the
first
gate
though
not
so
startling
and
violent
in
its
features
the
bare
walls
on
either
side
fall
sheer
to
the
water
and
the
road
crossing
the
sihoon
by
a
lofty
bridge
of
a
single
arch
is
cut
along
the
face
of
the
rock
near
the
bridge
a
subterranean
stream
almost
as
large
as
the
river
bursts
forth
from
the
solid
heart
of
the
mountain
on
either
side
gigantic
masses
of
rock
with
here
and
there
a
pine
to
adorn
their
sterility
tower
to
the
height
of
feet
in
some
places
almost
perpendicular
from
summit
to
base
they
are
worn
and
broken
into
all
fantastic
forms
there
are
pyramids
towers
bastions
minarets
and
long
sharp
spires
splintered
and
jagged
as
the
turrets
of
an
iceberg
i
have
seen
higher
mountains
but
i
have
never
seen
any
which
looked
so
high
as
these
we
camped
on
a
narrow
plot
of
ground
in
the
very
heart
of
the
tremendous
gorge
a
soldier
passing
along
at
dusk
told
us
that
a
merchant
and
his
servant
were
murdered
in
the
same
place
last
winter
and
advised
us
to
keep
watch
but
we
slept
safely
all
night
while
the
stars
sparkled
over
the
chasm
and
slips
of
misty
cloud
hung
low
on
the
thousand
pinnacles
of
rock
when
i
awoke
the
gorge
lay
in
deep
shadow
but
high
up
on
the
western
mountain
above
the
enormous
black
pyramids
that
arose
from
the
river
the
topmost
pinnacles
of
rock
sparkled
like
molten
silver
in
the
full
gush
of
sunrise
the
great
mountain
blocking
up
the
gorge
behind
us
was
bathed
almost
to
its
foot
in
the
rays
and
seen
through
such
a
dark
vista
was
glorified
beyond
all
other
mountains
of
earth
the
air
was
piercingly
cold
and
keen
and
i
could
scarcely
bear
the
water
of
the
sihoon
on
my
face
there
was
a
little
spring
not
far
off
from
which
we
obtained
sufficient
water
to
drink
the
river
being
too
muddy
the
spring
was
but
a
thread
oozing
from
the
soil
but
the
hadji
collected
it
in
handfuls
which
he
emptied
into
his
and
then
brought
to
us
the
morning
light
gave
a
still
finer
effect
to
the
manifold
forms
of
the
mountains
than
that
of
the
afternoon
sun
the
soft
gray
hue
of
the
rocks
shone
clearly
against
the
cloudless
sky
fretted
all
over
with
the
shadows
thrown
by
their
innumerable
spires
and
jutting
points
and
by
the
natural
arches
scooped
out
under
the
cliffs
after
travelling
less
than
an
hour
we
passed
the
riven
walls
of
the
mighty
gateway
and
rode
again
under
the
shade
of
pine
forests
the
height
of
the
mountains
now
gradually
diminished
and
their
sides
covered
with
pine
and
cedar
became
less
broken
and
abrupt
the
summits
nevertheless
still
retained
the
same
rocky
spine
shooting
up
into
tall
single
towers
or
long
lines
of
even
parapets
occasionally
through
gaps
between
we
caught
glimpses
of
the
dazzlingly
high
and
white
after
travelling
eight
or
nine
miles
we
emerged
from
the
pass
and
left
the
sihoon
at
a
place
called
chiftlik
khan
a
stone
building
with
a
small
fort
adjoining
wherein
fifteen
splendid
bronze
cannon
lay
neglected
on
their
broken
and
rotting
carriages
as
we
crossed
the
stone
bridge
over
the
river
a
valley
opened
suddenly
on
the
left
disclosing
the
whole
range
of
the
taurus
which
we
now
saw
on
its
northern
side
a
vast
stretch
of
rocky
spires
with
sparkling
between
and
long
ravines
filled
with
snow
extending
far
down
between
the
dark
blue
cliffs
and
the
dark
green
plumage
of
the
cedars
immediately
after
passing
the
central
chain
of
the
taurus
the
character
of
the
scenery
changed
the
heights
were
rounded
the
rocky
strata
only
appearing
on
the
higher
peaks
and
the
slopes
of
loose
soil
were
deeply
cut
and
scarred
by
the
rains
of
ages
both
in
appearance
especially
in
the
scattered
growth
of
trees
dotted
over
the
dark
red
soil
and
in
their
formation
these
mountains
strongly
resemble
the
middle
ranges
of
the
californian
sierra
nevada
we
climbed
a
long
winding
glen
until
we
had
attained
a
considerable
height
when
the
road
reached
a
dividing
ridge
giving
us
a
view
of
a
deep
valley
beyond
which
a
chain
of
barren
mountains
rose
to
the
height
of
some
five
thousand
feet
as
we
descended
the
rocky
path
a
little
caravan
of
asses
and
mules
clambered
up
to
meet
us
along
the
brinks
of
steep
gulfs
the
narrow
strip
of
bottom
land
along
the
stream
was
planted
with
rye
now
in
head
and
rolling
in
silvery
waves
before
the
wind
after
our
noonday
halt
we
went
over
the
hills
to
another
stream
which
came
from
the
its
valley
was
broader
and
greener
than
that
we
had
left
and
the
hills
inclosing
it
had
soft
and
undulating
outlines
they
were
bare
of
trees
but
colored
a
pale
green
by
their
thin
clothing
of
grass
and
herbs
in
this
valley
the
season
was
so
late
owing
to
its
height
above
the
sea
that
the
early
were
yet
in
bloom
poppies
flamed
among
the
wheat
and
the
banks
of
the
stream
were
brilliant
with
patches
of
a
creeping
plant
with
a
bright
purple
blossom
the
asphodel
grew
in
great
profusion
and
an
shrub
covered
with
flakes
of
white
bloom
made
the
air
faint
with
its
fragrance
still
further
up
we
came
to
orchards
of
walnut
and
plum
trees
and
vineyards
there
were
no
houses
but
the
innabitants
who
were
mostly
turcomans
live
in
villages
during
the
winter
and
in
summer
pitch
their
tents
on
the
mountains
where
they
pasture
their
flocks
directly
over
this
quiet
pastoral
vale
towered
the
taurus
and
i
looked
at
once
on
its
secluded
loveliness
and
on
the
wintry
heights
whose
bleak
and
sublime
heads
were
mantled
in
clouds
from
no
point
is
there
a
more
imposing
view
of
the
whole
snowy
range
near
the
head
of
the
valley
we
passed
a
large
turcoman
encampment
surrounded
with
herds
of
sheep
and
cattle
we
halted
for
the
evening
at
a
place
called
immense
resembling
baïas
and
like
it
wholly
deserted
near
it
there
is
a
small
town
of
very
neat
houses
which
is
also
deserted
the
inhabitants
having
gone
into
the
mountains
with
their
flocks
i
walked
through
the
fortress
which
is
a
massive
building
of
stone
about
feet
square
erected
by
sultan
murad
as
a
for
the
caravans
to
mecca
it
has
two
spacious
portals
in
which
the
iron
doors
are
still
hanging
connected
by
a
vaulted
passage
twenty
feet
high
and
forty
wide
with
bazaars
on
each
side
side
gateways
open
into
large
courts
surrounded
with
arched
chambers
there
is
a
mosque
entire
with
its
pulpit
and
galleries
and
the
gilded
crescent
still
glittering
over
its
dome
behind
it
is
a
bath
containing
an
entrance
hall
and
half
a
dozen
chambers
in
which
the
and
stone
tanks
still
remain
with
a
little
alteration
the
building
would
make
a
capital
phalanstery
where
the
fourierites
might
try
their
experiment
without
contact
with
society
there
is
no
field
for
them
equal
to
asia
minor
a
glorious
region
abounding
in
natural
wealth
almost
depopulated
and
containing
a
great
number
of
phalansteries
ready
built
we
succeeded
in
getting
some
eggs
fowls
and
milk
from
an
old
turcoman
who
had
charge
of
the
village
a
man
who
rode
by
on
a
donkey
sold
us
a
bag
of
sour
which
was
delicious
notwithstanding
the
suspicious
appearance
of
the
bag
it
was
made
before
the
cream
had
been
removed
and
was
very
rich
and
nourishing
the
old
turcoman
sat
down
and
watched
us
while
we
ate
but
would
not
join
us
as
these
wandering
tribes
are
very
strict
in
keeping
ramazan
when
we
had
reached
our
dessert
a
plate
of
fine
cherries
another
and
dignified
gentleman
visited
us
we
handed
him
the
cherries
expecting
that
he
would
take
a
few
and
politely
return
the
dish
but
no
such
thing
he
coolly
produced
his
handkerchief
emptied
everything
into
it
and
marched
off
he
also
did
not
venture
to
eat
although
we
pointed
to
the
taurus
on
whose
upper
snows
the
last
gleam
of
daylight
was
just
melting
away
we
arose
this
morning
in
a
dark
cloudy
dawn
there
was
a
heavy
black
storm
hanging
low
in
the
west
and
another
was
gathering
its
forces
along
the
mountains
behind
us
a
cold
wind
blew
down
the
valley
and
long
peals
of
thunder
rolled
grandly
among
the
gorges
of
taurus
an
isolated
hill
crowned
with
a
shattered
crag
which
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
a
ruined
fortress
stood
out
black
and
sharp
against
the
far
misty
sunlit
peaks
as
far
as
the
springs
were
yet
undried
the
land
was
covered
with
flowers
in
one
place
i
saw
a
large
square
plot
of
the
most
brilliant
crimson
hue
burning
amid
the
green
as
if
some
tyrian
mantle
had
been
flung
there
the
long
harmonious
slopes
and
rounded
summits
of
the
hills
were
covered
with
drifts
of
a
beautiful
purple
clover
and
a
diminutive
variety
of
the
or
yarrow
with
glowing
yellow
blossoms
the
leaves
had
a
pleasant
aromatic
odor
and
filled
the
air
with
their
refreshing
breath
as
they
were
crushed
under
the
hoofs
of
our
horses
we
had
now
reached
the
highest
ridge
of
the
hilly
country
along
the
northern
base
of
taurus
and
saw
far
and
wide
before
us
the
great
central
plain
of
karamania
two
isolated
mountains
at
forty
or
fifty
miles
distance
broke
the
monotony
of
the
level
kara
dagh
in
the
west
and
the
summits
of
hassan
dagh
in
the
beyond
the
latter
we
tried
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
famous
mons
argseus
at
the
base
of
which
is
kaisariyeh
the
ancient
cæsarea
of
cappadocia
this
mountain
which
is
feet
high
is
the
loftiest
peak
of
asia
minor
the
clouds
hung
low
on
the
horizon
and
the
rains
were
falling
veiling
it
from
our
sight
our
road
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
over
barren
hills
covered
with
scanty
herbage
the
sun
shone
out
intensely
hot
and
the
glare
of
the
white
soil
was
exceedingly
painful
to
my
eyes
the
locality
of
eregli
was
betrayed
some
time
before
we
reached
it
by
its
belt
of
fruit
trees
it
stands
in
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
valley
which
winds
down
from
the
taurus
and
is
watered
by
a
large
rapid
stream
that
finally
loses
itself
in
the
lakes
and
morasses
of
the
plain
there
had
been
a
heavy
black
gathering
and
as
we
reached
our
under
some
fine
near
the
stream
a
sudden
blast
of
cold
wind
swept
over
the
town
filling
the
air
with
dust
we
pitched
the
tent
in
all
haste
expecting
a
storm
but
the
rain
finally
passed
to
the
northward
we
then
took
a
walk
through
the
town
which
is
a
forlorn
place
a
spacious
khan
built
apparently
for
the
mecca
pilgrims
is
in
ruins
but
the
mosque
has
an
exquisite
minaret
eighty
feet
high
and
still
bearing
traces
of
the
devices
in
blue
tiles
which
once
covered
it
the
shops
were
mostly
closed
and
in
those
which
were
still
open
the
owners
lay
at
full
length
on
their
bellies
their
faces
gaunt
with
fasting
they
seemed
annoyed
at
our
troubling
them
even
with
purchases
one
would
have
thought
that
some
fearful
pestilence
had
fallen
upon
the
town
the
cobblers
only
who
somewhat
languidly
plied
their
implements
seemed
to
retain
a
little
life
the
few
jews
and
armenians
smoked
their
pipes
in
a
tantalizing
manner
in
the
very
faces
of
the
poor
mussulmans
we
bought
an
oka
of
excellent
cherries
which
we
were
cruel
enough
to
taste
in
the
streets
before
the
hungry
eyes
of
the
suffering
merchants
this
evening
the
asses
belonging
to
the
place
were
driven
in
from
pasture
four
or
five
hundred
in
all
and
such
a
show
of
curious
asinine
specimens
as
i
never
before
beheld
a
dervish
who
was
with
us
in
quarantine
at
adana
has
just
arrived
he
had
lost
his
passport
and
on
issuing
forth
purified
was
cast
into
prison
finally
he
found
some
one
who
knew
him
and
procured
his
release
he
had
come
on
foot
to
this
place
in
five
days
suffering
many
privations
having
been
hours
without
food
he
is
bound
to
konia
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
tomb
of
hazret
mevlana
the
founder
of
the
sect
of
dancing
dervishes
we
gave
him
food
in
return
for
which
he
taught
me
the
formula
of
his
prayers
he
tells
me
i
should
always
pronounce
the
name
of
allah
when
my
horse
stumbles
or
i
see
a
man
in
danger
of
his
life
as
the
word
has
a
saving
power
hadji
youssuf
who
has
just
been
begging
for
an
advance
of
twenty
piastres
to
buy
grain
for
his
horses
swore
by
the
pardon
of
god
that
he
would
sell
the
lame
horse
at
konia
and
get
a
better
one
we
have
lost
all
confidence
in
the
old
villain
promises
but
the
poor
beasts
shall
not
suffer
for
his
delinquencies
our
tent
is
in
a
charming
spot
and
from
without
makes
a
picture
to
be
remembered
the
yellow
illumination
from
within
strikes
on
the
under
sides
of
the
walnut
boughs
while
the
moonlight
silvers
them
from
above
beyond
gardens
where
the
nightingales
are
singing
the
tall
minaret
of
eregli
stands
revealed
in
the
vapory
glow
the
night
is
too
sweet
and
balmy
for
sleep
and
yet
i
must
close
my
eyes
upon
it
for
the
hot

françois
awoke
us
at
the
break
of
day
at
eregli
as
we
had
a
journey
of
twelve
hours
before
us
passing
through
the
town
we
traversed
a
narrow
belt
of
garden
and
orchard
land
and
entered
the
great
plain
of
karamania
our
road
led
at
first
northward
towards
a
range
called
karadja
dagh
and
then
skirted
its
base
westward
after
three
hours
travel
we
passed
a
village
of
neat
whitewashed
houses
which
were
entirely
deserted
all
the
inhabitants
having
gone
off
to
the
mountains
there
were
some
herds
scattered
over
the
plain
near
the
village
as
the
day
wore
on
the
wind
which
had
been
chill
in
the
morning
ceased
and
the
air
became
hot
and
sultry
the
glare
from
the
white
soil
was
so
painful
that
i
was
obliged
to
close
my
eyes
and
so
ran
a
continual
risk
of
falling
asleep
and
tumbling
from
my
horse
thus
drowsy
and
half
unconscious
of
my
whereabouts
i
rode
on
in
the
heat
and
arid
silence
of
the
plain
until
noon
when
we
reached
a
well
it
was
a
shaft
sunk
about
thirty
feet
deep
with
a
long
sloping
gallery
slanting
off
to
the
surface
the
well
was
nearly
dry
but
by
descending
the
gallery
we
obtained
a
sufficient
supply
of
cold
pure
water
we
breakfasted
in
the
shaded
doorway
sharing
our
provisions
with
a
turcoman
boy
who
was
accompanying
his
father
to
eregli
with
a
load
of
salt
our
road
now
crossed
a
long
barren
pass
between
two
parts
of
karadja
dagh
near
the
northern
side
there
was
a
salt
lake
of
one
hundred
yards
in
diameter
sunk
in
a
deep
natural
basin
the
water
was
intensely
saline
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
is
an
extinct
volcano
the
crater
of
which
near
two
hundred
feet
deep
is
a
salt
lake
with
a
trachytic
cone
three
hundred
feet
high
rising
from
the
centre
from
the
slope
of
the
mountain
we
overlooked
another
and
somewhat
deeper
plain
extending
to
the
north
and
west
it
was
bounded
by
broken
peaks
all
of
which
betrayed
a
volcanic
origin
far
before
us
we
saw
the
tower
on
the
hill
of
our
for
the
night
the
road
thither
was
over
a
barren
plain
cheered
here
and
there
by
patches
of
a
plant
which
was
covered
with
pink
blossoms
harrison
scared
up
some
coveys
of
the
frankolin
a
large
bird
resembling
the
pheasant
and
enriched
our
larder
with
a
dozen
starlings
is
built
on
the
slope
of
a
mound
at
the
foot
of
which
stands
a
spacious
mosque
visible
far
over
the
plain
it
has
a
dome
and
two
tall
towers
similar
to
those
of
the
of
cairo
near
it
are
the
remains
of
a
magnificent
said
to
have
been
built
by
the
eunuch
of
one
of
the
former
sultans
as
there
was
no
water
in
the
wells
outside
of
the
town
we
entered
the
khan
and
pitched
the
tent
in
its
court
six
square
pillars
of
hewn
stone
made
an
aisle
to
our
door
and
the
lofty
roofless
walls
of
the
court
by
feet
inclosed
us
another
court
of
similar
size
communicated
with
it
by
a
broad
portal
and
the
remains
of
baths
and
bazaars
lay
beyond
a
handsome
stone
fountain
with
two
streams
of
running
water
stood
in
front
of
the
khan
we
were
royally
lodged
but
almost
starved
in
our
splendor
as
only
two
or
three
turcomans
remained
out
of
two
thousand
who
had
gone
off
with
their
herds
to
the
mountains
and
they
were
unable
to
furnish
us
with
provisions
but
for
our
frankolins
and
starlings
we
should
have
gone
fasting
the
mosque
was
a
beautiful
structure
of
white
limestone
and
the
galleries
of
its
minarets
were
adorned
with
rich
arabesque
ornaments
while
the
muezzin
was
crying
his
to
prayer
i
entered
the
portico
and
looked
into
the
interior
which
was
so
bare
as
to
appear
incomplete
as
we
sat
in
our
after
dinner
the
moon
arose
lighting
up
the
niches
in
the
walls
the
clusters
of
windows
in
the
immense
eastern
gable
and
the
rows
of
massive
columns
the
large
dimensions
of
the
building
gave
it
a
truly
grand
effect
and
but
for
the
whine
of
a
distant
jackal
i
could
have
believed
that
we
were
sitting
in
the
aisles
of
a
roofless
gothic
cathedral
in
the
heart
of
europe
françois
was
somewhat
fearful
of
thieves
but
the
peace
and
repose
of
the
place
we
so
perfect
that
i
would
not
allow
any
such
apprehensions
to
disturb
me
in
two
minutes
after
i
touched
my
bed
i
was
insensible
and
i
did
not
move
a
limb
until
sunrise
beyond
there
is
a
low
barren
ridge
climbing
which
we
overlooked
an
immense
plain
uncultivated
apparently
unfertile
and
without
a
sign
of
life
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
kara
dagh
in
the
south
lifted
nearer
us
its
cluster
of
dark
summits
to
the
north
the
long
ridge
of
üsedjik
dagh
the
pigmy
mountain
stretched
like
a
cape
into
the
plain
hassan
dagh
wrapped
in
a
soft
white
cloud
receded
behind
us
and
the
snows
of
taurus
seemed
almost
as
distant
as
when
we
first
beheld
them
from
the
syrian
gates
we
rode
for
four
hours
over
the
dead
level
the
only
objects
that
met
our
eyes
being
an
occasional
herd
of
camels
in
the
distance
about
noon
we
reached
a
well
similar
to
that
of
the
previous
day
but
of
recent
construction
a
long
steep
gallery
led
down
to
the
water
which
was
very
cold
but
had
a
villainous
taste
of
lime
salt
and
sulphur
after
an
hour
halt
we
started
again
the
sun
was
intensely
hot
and
for
hours
we
jogged
on
over
the
dead
level
the
bare
white
soil
blinding
our
eyes
with
its
glare
the
distant
hills
were
lifted
above
the
horizon
by
a
mirage
long
sheets
of
blue
water
were
spread
along
their
bases
islanding
the
isolated
peaks
and
turning
into
ships
and
boats
the
black
specks
of
camels
far
away
but
the
phenomena
were
by
no
means
on
so
grand
a
scale
as
i
had
seen
in
the
nubian
desert
on
the
horizon
we
discerned
the
summits
of
the
karaman
range
of
taurus
covered
with
snow
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
saw
a
solitary
tent
upon
the
plain
from
which
an
individual
advanced
to
meet
us
as
he
drew
nearer
we
noticed
that
he
wore
white
frank
pantaloons
similar
to
the
turkish
soldiery
with
a
jacket
of
brown
cloth
and
a
heavy
sabre
when
he
was
within
convenient
speaking
distance
he
cried
out
stop
why
are
you
running
away
from
me
what
do
you
call
running
away
rejoined
françois
we
are
going
on
our
journey
where
do
you
come
from
he
then
asked
from
there
said
françois
pointing
behind
us
where
are
you
going
there
and
the
provoking
greek
simply
pointed
forwards
you
have
neither
faith
nor
religion
said
the
man
indignantly
then
turning
upon
his
heel
he
strode
back
across
the
plain
about
four
we
saw
a
long
line
of
objects
rising
before
us
but
so
distorted
by
the
mirage
that
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
they
were
after
a
while
however
we
decided
that
they
were
houses
interspersed
with
trees
but
the
trees
proved
to
be
stacks
of
hay
and
lentils
heaped
on
the
flat
roofs
this
was
ismil
our
the
houses
were
miserable
mud
huts
but
the
village
was
large
and
unlike
most
of
those
we
have
seen
this
side
of
taurus
inhabited
the
people
are
turcomans
and
their
possessions
appear
to
be
almost
entirely
in
their
herds
immense
numbers
of
sheep
and
goats
were
pasturing
on
the
plain
there
were
several
wells
in
the
place
provided
with
buckets
attached
to
long
the
water
was
very
cold
but
brackish
our
tent
was
pitched
on
the
plain
on
a
hard
gravelly
strip
of
soil
a
crowd
of
turcoman
boys
gathered
in
front
to
stare
at
us
and
the
shepherds
quarrelled
at
the
wells
as
to
which
should
take
his
turn
at
watering
his
flocks
in
the
evening
a
handsome
old
turk
visited
us
and
finding
that
we
were
bound
to
constantinople
requested
françois
to
take
a
letter
to
his
son
who
was
settled
there
françois
aroused
us
this
morning
before
the
dawn
as
we
had
a
journey
of
miles
before
us
he
was
in
a
bad
humor
for
a
man
whom
he
had
requested
to
keep
watch
over
his
tent
while
he
went
into
the
village
had
stolen
a
fork
and
spoon
the
old
turk
who
had
returned
as
soon
as
we
were
stirring
went
out
to
hunt
the
thief
but
did
not
succeed
in
finding
him
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
were
up
long
before
sunrise
and
driving
away
in
their
carts
to
the
meadows
where
they
cut
grass
the
old
turk
accompanied
us
some
distance
in
order
to
show
us
a
nearer
way
avoiding
a
marshy
spot
our
road
lay
over
a
vast
plain
seemingly
boundless
for
the
lofty
that
surrounded
it
on
all
sides
were
so
distant
and
and
so
lifted
from
the
horizon
by
the
deceptive
mirage
that
the
eye
did
not
recognize
their
connection
with
it
the
wind
blew
strongly
from
the
and
was
so
cold
that
i
dismounted
and
walked
ahead
for
two
or
three
hours
before
noon
we
passed
two
villages
of
mud
huts
partly
inhabited
and
with
some
around
them
we
breakfasted
at
another
well
which
furnished
us
with
a
drink
that
tasted
like
iced
thence
we
rode
forth
again
into
the
heat
for
the
wind
had
fallen
by
this
time
and
the
sun
shone
out
with
great
force
there
was
ever
the
same
dead
level
and
we
rode
directly
towards
the
mountains
which
to
my
eyes
seemed
nearly
as
distant
as
ever
at
last
there
was
a
dark
glimmer
through
the
mirage
at
their
base
and
a
ride
showed
it
to
be
a
line
of
trees
in
another
hour
we
could
distinguish
a
minaret
or
two
and
finally
walls
and
the
stately
domes
of
mosques

konia
ancient
iconium
the
view
of
konia
from
the
plain
is
not
striking
until
one
has
approached
within
a
mile
of
the
suburbs
when
the
group
of
mosques
with
their
heavy
central
domes
lifted
on
clusters
of
smaller
ones
and
their
tall
light
glittering
minarets
rising
above
the
foliage
of
the
gardens
against
the
background
of
airy
hills
has
a
very
pleasing
effect
we
approached
through
a
long
line
of
dirty
suburbs
which
looked
still
more
forlorn
on
account
of
the
ramazan
some
turkish
officials
in
shabby
frank
dresses
followed
us
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
by
talking
with
our
or
muleteers
outside
the
city
walls
we
passed
some
very
large
barracks
for
cavalry
built
by
ibrahim
pasha
on
the
plain
of
the
city
the
battle
between
him
and
the
forces
of
the
sultan
resulting
in
the
defeat
of
the
latter
was
fought
we
next
came
upon
two
magnificent
mosques
built
of
white
limestone
with
a
multitude
of
leaden
domes
and
lofty
minarets
adorned
with
galleries
rich
in
arabesque
ornaments
attached
to
one
of
them
is
the
tomb
of
hazret
mevlana
the
founder
of
the
sect
of
mevlevi
dervishes
which
is
reputed
one
of
the
most
sacred
places
in
the
east
the
tomb
is
surmounted
by
a
dome
upon
which
stands
a
tall
cylindrical
tower
reeded
with
channels
between
each
projection
and
terminating
in
a
long
tapering
cone
this
tower
is
made
of
glazed
tiles
of
the
most
brilliant
color
and
sparkles
in
the
sun
like
a
vast
pillar
of
icy
spar
in
some
polar
grotto
it
is
a
most
striking
and
fantastic
object
surrounded
by
a
cluster
of
minarets
and
several
amid
which
it
seems
placed
as
the
central
ornament
and
crown
of
the
group
the
aspect
of
the
city
was
so
filthy
and
uninviting
that
we
preferred
pitching
our
tent
but
it
was
impossible
to
find
a
place
without
going
back
upon
the
plain
so
we
turned
into
the
bazaar
and
asked
the
way
to
a
khan
there
was
a
tolerable
crowd
in
the
street
although
many
of
the
shops
were
shut
the
first
khan
we
visited
was
too
filthy
to
enter
but
the
second
though
most
unpromising
in
appearance
turned
out
to
be
better
than
it
looked
the
master
of
the
rooms
thoroughly
swept
and
sprinkled
the
narrow
little
chamber
he
gave
us
laid
clean
mats
upon
the
floor
and
when
our
carpets
and
beds
were
placed
within
its
walls
of
mud
looked
somewhat
comfortable
its
single
window
with
an
iron
grating
in
lieu
of
glass
looked
upon
an
oblong
court
on
the
second
story
surrounded
by
the
rooms
of
armenian
merchants
the
main
court
the
gate
of
which
is
always
closed
at
sunset
is
two
stories
in
height
with
a
rough
wooden
balcony
running
around
it
and
a
well
of
muddy
water
in
the
centre
the
lent
us
a
turkish
table
and
supplied
us
with
dinner
from
his
own
kitchen
kibabs
stewed
beans
and
cucumber
salad
and
i
forgetting
the
ramazan
went
out
to
hunt
for
an
iced
sherbet
but
all
the
were
closed
until
sunset
the
people
stared
at
our
egyptian
costumes
and
a
fellow
in
official
dress
demanded
my
soon
after
we
returned
françois
appeared
with
a
splendid
lump
of
ice
in
a
basin
and
some
lemons
the
ice
so
the
said
is
taken
from
a
lake
among
the
mountains
which
in
winter
freezes
to
the
thickness
of
a
foot
behind
the
lake
is
a
natural
cavern
which
the
people
fill
with
ice
and
then
close
up
at
this
season
they
take
it
out
day
by
day
and
bring
it
down
to
the
city
it
is
very
pure
and
thick
and
justifies
the
turkish
proverb
in
regard
to
konia
which
is
celebrated
for
three
excellent
things
booz
salt
ice
and
girls
soon
after
sunset
a
cannon
announced
the
close
of
the
fast
we
waited
an
hour
or
two
longer
to
allow
the
people
time
to
eat
and
then
sallied
out
into
the
streets
every
minaret
in
the
city
blazed
with
a
crown
of
lighted
lamps
around
its
upper
gallery
while
the
long
shafts
below
and
the
tapering
cones
above
topped
with
brazen
crescents
shone
fair
in
the
moonlight
it
was
a
strange
brilliant
spectacle
in
the
square
before
the
principal
mosque
we
found
a
crowd
of
persons
frolicking
around
the
fountain
in
the
light
of
a
number
of
torches
on
poles
planted
in
the
ground
mats
were
spread
on
the
stones
and
rows
of
turks
of
all
classes
sat
thereon
smoking
their
pipes
large
earthen
stood
here
and
there
and
the
people
drank
so
often
and
so
long
that
they
seemed
determined
to
provide
against
the
morrow
the
boys
were
having
their
amusement
in
wrestling
shouting
and
firing
off
squibs
which
they
threw
into
the
crowd
we
kicked
off
our
slippers
sat
down
among
the
turks
smoked
a
narghileh
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
and
an
iced
sherbet
of
raisin
juice
and
so
enjoyed
the
ramazan
as
well
as
the
best
of
them
numbers
of
true
believers
were
drinking
and
washing
themselves
at
the
picturesque
fountain
and
just
as
we
rose
to
depart
the
voice
of
a
on
one
of
the
tallest
minarets
sent
down
a
musical
call
to
prayer
immediately
the
boys
left
off
their
sports
and
started
on
a
run
for
the
great
mosque
and
the
grave
turks
got
up
from
the
mats
shoved
on
their
slippers
and
marched
after
them
we
followed
getting
a
glimpse
of
the
illuminated
interior
of
the
building
as
we
passed
but
the
conducted
us
still
further
to
a
smaller
though
more
beautiful
mosque
surrounded
with
a
it
was
a
truly
magical
picture
we
entered
the
gate
and
passed
on
by
a
marble
pavement
under
trees
and
arbors
of
vines
that
almost
shut
out
the
moonlight
to
a
paved
space
in
the
centre
whereof
was
a
beautiful
fountain
in
the
purest
saracenic
style
its
heavy
projecting
cornices
and
tall
pyramidal
roof
rested
on
a
circle
of
elegant
arches
surrounding
a
marble
structure
whence
the
water
gushed
forth
in
a
dozen
sparkling
streams
on
three
sides
it
was
inclosed
by
the
moonlit
trees
and
arbors
on
the
fourth
by
the
outer
corridor
of
the
mosque
the
door
of
entrance
being
exactly
opposite
large
numbers
of
persons
were
washing
their
hands
and
feet
at
the
fountain
after
which
they
entered
and
knelt
on
the
floor
we
stood
unobserved
in
the
corridor
and
looked
in
on
the
splendidly
illuminated
interior
and
the
crowd
at
prayer
all
bending
their
bodies
to
the
earth
at
regular
intervals
and
murmuring
the
name
of
allah
they
resembled
a
plain
of
reeds
bending
before
the
gusts
of
wind
which
precede
a
storm
when
all
had
entered
and
were
united
in
solemn
prayer
we
returned
passing
the
grand
mosque
i
stole
up
to
the
door
lifted
the
heavy
carpet
that
hung
before
it
and
looked
in
there
was
a
mevlevi
dervish
standing
in
the
entrance
but
his
eyes
were
lifted
in
heavenly
abstraction
and
he
did
not
see
me
the
interior
was
brilliantly
lit
by
white
and
colored
lamps
suspended
from
the
walls
and
the
great
central
dome
it
was
an
imposing
structure
simple
in
form
yet
grand
from
its
dimensions
the
floor
was
covered
with
kneeling
figures
and
a
deep
voice
coming
from
the
other
end
of
the
mosque
was
uttering
pious
phrases
in
a
kind
of
chant
i
satisfied
my
curiosity
quickly
and
we
then
returned
to
the
khan
yesterday
afternoon
i
made
a
more
thorough
examination
of
the
city
passing
through
the
bazaars
i
reached
the
serai
or
pasha
palace
which
stands
on
the
site
of
that
of
the
sultans
of
iconium
it
is
a
long
wooden
building
with
no
pretensions
to
architectural
beauty
near
it
there
is
a
large
and
ancient
mosque
with
a
minaret
of
singular
elegance
it
is
about
feet
high
with
two
hanging
galleries
the
whole
built
of
blue
and
red
bricks
the
latter
projecting
so
as
to
form
quaint
patterns
or
designs
several
ancient
buildings
near
this
mosque
are
surmounted
with
pyramidal
towers
resembling
pagodas
of
india
following
the
long
crooked
lanes
between
mud
buildings
we
passed
these
curious
structures
and
reached
the
ancient
wall
of
the
city
in
one
of
the
streets
lay
a
marble
lion
badly
executed
and
apparently
of
the
time
of
the
lower
empire
in
the
wall
were
inserted
many
similar
figures
with
fragments
of
friezes
and
cornices
this
is
the
work
of
the
seljook
kings
who
in
building
the
wall
took
great
pains
to
exhibit
the
fragments
of
the
ancient
city
the
number
of
altars
they
have
preserved
is
quite
remarkable
on
the
square
towers
are
sunken
tablets
containing
long
arabic
inscriptions
the
high
walls
of
a
ruined
building
in
the
southern
part
of
the
city
attracted
us
and
on
going
thither
we
found
it
to
be
an
ancient
mosque
standing
on
an
eminence
formed
apparently
of
the
debris
of
other
buildings
part
of
the
wall
was
also
ancient
and
in
some
places
showed
the
marks
of
an
earthquake
a
long
flight
of
steps
led
up
to
the
door
of
the
mosque
and
as
we
ascended
we
were
rewarded
by
the
most
charming
view
of
the
city
and
the
grand
plain
konia
lay
at
our
feet
a
wide
straggling
array
of
low
mud
dwellings
dotted
all
over
with
patches
of
garden
verdure
while
its
three
superb
mosques
with
the
many
smaller
tombs
and
places
of
worship
appeared
like
buildings
left
from
some
former
and
more
magnificent
capital
outside
of
this
circle
ran
a
belt
of
garden
land
adorned
with
groves
and
long
lines
of
fruit
trees
still
further
the
plain
a
sea
of
faded
green
flecked
with
the
softest
and
beyond
all
the
beautiful
outlines
and
dreamy
tints
of
the
different
mountain
chains
it
was
in
every
respect
a
lovely
landscape
and
the
city
is
unworthy
such
surroundings
the
sky
which
in
this
region
is
of
a
pale
soft
delicious
blue
was
dotted
with
scattered
fleeces
of
white
clouds
and
there
was
an
exquisite
play
of
light
and
shade
over
the
hills
there
were
half
a
dozen
men
and
boys
about
the
door
amusing
themselves
with
bursting
percussion
caps
on
the
stone
they
addressed
us
as
pilgrims
begging
for
more
caps
i
told
them
i
was
not
a
turk
but
an
arab
which
they
believed
at
once
and
requested
me
to
enter
the
mosque
the
interior
had
a
remarkably
fine
effect
it
was
a
maze
of
arches
supported
by
columns
of
polished
black
marble
forty
in
number
in
form
it
was
nearly
square
and
covered
with
a
flat
wooden
roof
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
carpet
whereon
several
persons
were
lying
at
full
length
while
an
old
man
seated
in
one
of
the
most
remote
corners
was
reading
in
a
loud
solemn
voice
it
is
a
peculiar
structure
which
i
should
be
glad
to
examine
more
in
detail
not
far
from
this
eminence
is
a
remarkable
leaning
minaret
more
than
a
hundred
feet
in
height
while
in
diameter
it
can
not
be
more
than
fifteen
feet
in
design
it
is
light
and
elegant
and
the
effect
is
not
injured
by
its
deviation
from
the
perpendicular
which
i
should
judge
to
be
about
six
feet
from
the
mosque
we
walked
over
the
mounds
of
old
iconium
to
the
eastern
wall
passing
another
mosque
wholly
in
ruin
but
which
must
have
once
been
more
splendid
than
any
now
standing
the
portal
is
the
richest
specimen
of
saracenic
sculpture
i
have
ever
seen
a
very
labyrinth
of
intricate
ornaments
the
artist
must
have
seen
the
great
portal
of
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
baalbec
the
minarets
have
tumbled
down
the
roof
has
fallen
in
but
the
walls
are
still
covered
with
white
and
blue
tiles
of
the
finest
workmanship
resembling
a
mosaic
of
ivory
and
lapis
lazuli
some
of
the
chambers
seem
to
be
inhabited
for
two
old
men
with
white
beards
lay
in
the
shade
and
were
not
a
little
startled
by
our
sudden
appearance
we
returned
to
the
great
mosque
which
we
had
visited
on
the
evening
of
our
arrival
and
listened
for
some
time
to
the
voice
of
a
mollah
who
was
preaching
an
afternoon
sermon
to
a
small
and
hungry
congregation
we
then
entered
the
court
before
the
tomb
of
hazret
mevlana
it
was
apparently
forbidden
ground
to
christians
but
as
the
dervishes
did
not
seem
to
suspect
us
we
walked
about
boldly
and
were
about
to
enter
when
an
indiscretion
of
my
companion
frustrated
our
plans
forgetting
his
assumed
character
he
went
to
the
fountain
and
drank
although
it
was
no
later
than
the
or
afternoon
prayer
the
dervishes
were
shocked
and
scandalized
by
this
violation
of
the
fast
in
the
very
of
their
holiest
mosque
and
we
judged
it
best
to
retire
by
degrees
we
sent
this
morning
to
request
an
interview
with
the
pasha
but
he
had
gone
to
pass
the
day
in
a
country
palace
about
three
hours
distant
it
is
a
still
hot
bright
afternoon
and
the
silence
of
the
famished
populace
disposes
us
to
repose
our
view
is
bounded
by
the
mud
walls
of
the
khan
and
i
already
long
for
the
freedom
of
the
great
karamanian
plain
here
in
the
heart
of
asia
minor
all
life
seems
to
stagnate
there
is
sleep
everywhere
and
i
feel
that
a
wide
barrier
separates
me
from
the
living
world
we
have
been
detained
here
a
whole
day
through
a
chain
of
accidents
all
resulting
from
the
rascality
of
our
muleteers
on
leaving
aleppo
the
lame
horse
they
palmed
upon
us
was
unable
to
go
further
so
we
obliged
them
to
buy
another
animal
which
they
succeeded
in
getting
for
piastres
we
advanced
the
money
although
they
were
still
in
our
debt
hoping
to
work
our
way
through
with
the
new
horse
and
thus
avoid
the
risk
of
loss
or
delay
but
this
morning
at
sunrise
hadji
youssuf
comes
with
a
woeful
face
to
say
that
the
new
horse
has
been
stolen
in
the
night
and
we
who
are
ready
to
start
must
sit
down
and
wait
till
he
is
recovered
i
suspected
another
trick
but
when
after
the
lapse
of
three
hours
françois
found
the
hadji
sitting
on
the
ground
weeping
and
achmet
beating
his
breast
it
seemed
probable
that
the
story
was
true
all
search
for
the
horse
being
vain
françois
went
with
them
to
the
shekh
of
the
horses
who
promised
in
case
it
should
hereafter
be
found
to
place
it
in
the
general
pen
where
they
would
be
sure
to
get
it
on
their
return
the
man
who
sold
them
the
horse
offered
them
another
for
the
lame
one
and
piastres
and
there
was
no
other
alternative
but
to
accept
it
but
must
advance
the
piastres
and
so
in
we
have
already
paid
them
to
the
end
with
the
risk
of
their
horses
breaking
down
or
they
horses
and
all
absconding
from
us
but
the
knavish
varlets
are
hardly
bold
enough

such
a
climax

of

the
evening
before

so
that
no
more
were
stolen
during

the
indefatigable
to
the

in

not

helped

but
accompanied
us
some
distance
on
our
way
all
the
merchants
in
the
khan
collected
in
the
gallery
to
see
us
start
and
we
made
our
exit
in
some
state
the
morning
was
clear
fresh
and
delightful
turning
away
from
the
city
walls
we
soon
emerged
from
the
lines
of
and
interminable
fields
of
and
came
out
upon
the
great
bare
plain
of
karamania
a
ride
of
three
hours
brought
us
to
a
long
sloping
hill
which
gave
us
a
view
of
the
whole
plain
and
its
circuit
of
mountains
a
dark
line
in
the
distance
marked
the
gardens
of
konia
on
the
right
near
the
centre
of
the
plain
the
lake
now
contracted
to
very
narrow
limits
glimmered
in
the
sun
notwithstanding
the
waste
and
unfertile
appearance
of
the
country
the
soft
sweet
sky
that
hangs
over
it
the
pure
transparent
air
the
grand
sweep
of
the
plain
and
the
varied
forms
of
the
different
mountain
chains
that
encompass
it
make
our
journey
an
inspiring
one
a
descent
of
the
hills
soon
shut
out
the
view
and
the
rest
of
the
day
journey
lay
among
them
skirting
the
eastern
base
of
allah
dagh
the
country
improved
in
character
as
we
advanced
the
bottoms
of
the
dry
glens
were
covered
with
wheat
and
shrubbery
began
to
make
its
appearance
on
the
in
the
afternoon
we
crossed
a
watershed
dividing
karamania
from
the
great
central
plain
of
asia
minor
and
descended
to
a
village
called
ladik
occupying
the
site
of
the
ancient
laodicea
at
the
foot
of
allah
dagh
the
plain
upon
which
we
came
was
greener
and
more
flourishing
than
that
we
had
left
trees
were
scattered
here
and
there
in
clumps
and
the
grassy
wastes
stretching
beyond
the
were
dotted
with
herds
of
cattle
emir
dagh
stood
in
the
blue
and
distant
while
towards
the
north
and
the
plain
extended
to
the
horizon
a
horizon
fifty
miles
distant
without
a
break
in
that
direction
lay
the
great
salt
lake
of
yüzler
and
the
strings
of
camels
we
met
on
the
road
laden
with
salt
were
returning
from
it
ladik
is
surrounded
with
brilliant
with
white
and
purple
blossoms
when
the
petals
have
fallen
the
natives
go
carefully
over
the
whole
field
and
make
incisions
in
every
stalk
whence
the
opium
exudes
we
pitched
our
tent
under
a
large
walnut
tree
which
we
found
standing
in
a
deserted
inclosure
the
graveyard
of
the
village
is
studded
with
relics
of
the
ancient
town
there
are
pillars
cornices
entablatures
jambs
altars
mullions
and
sculptured
tablets
all
of
white
marble
and
many
of
them
in
an
excellent
state
of
preservation
they
appear
to
date
from
the
early
time
of
the
lower
empire
and
the
cross
has
not
yet
been
effaced
from
some
which
serve
as
for
the
true
believers
i
was
particularly
struck
with
the
abundance
of
altars
some
of
which
contained
entire
and
legible
inscriptions
in
the
town
there
is
the
same
abundance
of
ruins
the
lid
of
a
sarcophagus
formed
of
a
single
block
of
marble
now
serves
as
a
and
the
fountain
is
constructed
of
ancient
tablets
the
town
stands
on
a
mound
which
appears
to
be
composed
entirely
of
the
debris
of
the
former
place
and
near
the
summit
there
are
many
holes
which
the
inhabitants
have
dug
in
their
search
for
rings
seals
and
other
relics
the
next
day
we
made
a
journey
of
nine
hours
over
a
hilly
country
lying
between
the
ranges
of
allah
dagh
and
emir
dagh
there
were
wells
of
excellent
water
along
the
road
at
intervals
of
an
hour
or
two
the
day
was
excessively
hot
and
sultry
during
the
noon
hours
and
the
flies
were
so
bad
as
to
give
great
inconvenience
to
our
horses
the
animal
i
bestrode
kicked
so
incessantly
that
i
could
scarcely
keep
my
seat
his
belly
was
swollen
and
covered
with
clotted
blood
from
their
bites
the
hadji
mule
began
to
show
symptoms
of
illness
and
we
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
it
on
its
legs
harrison
bled
it
in
the
mouth
as
a
last
resource
and
during
the
afternoon
it
partly
recovered
an
hour
before
sunset
we
reached
ilgün
a
town
on
the
plain
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
spurs
of
emir
dagh
to
the
west
of
it
there
is
a
lake
of
considerable
size
which
receives
the
streams
that
flow
through
the
town
and
water
its
fertile
gardens
we
passed
through
the
town
and
pitched
our
tent
upon
a
beautiful
grassy
meadow
our
customary
pipe
of
refreshment
was
never
more
heartily
enjoyed
than
at
this
place
behind
us
was
a
barren
hill
at
the
foot
of
which
was
a
natural
hot
bath
wherein
a
number
of
women
and
children
were
amusing
themselves
the
afternoon
heat
had
passed
away
the
air
was
calm
sweet
and
tempered
with
the
freshness
of
coming
evening
and
the
long
shadows
of
the
hills
creeping
over
the
meadows
had
almost
reached
the
town
beyond
the
line
of
sycamore
poplar
and
that
shaded
the
gardens
of
ilgün
rose
the
distant
chain
of
allah
dagh
and
in
the
sky
not
far
above
it
the
dim
face
of
the
gibbous
moon
showed
like
the
ghost
of
a
planet
our
horses
were
feeding
on
the
green
meadow
an
old
turk
sat
beside
us
silent
with
fasting
and
there
was
no
sound
but
the
shouts
of
the
children
in
the
bath
such
hours
as
these
after
a
day
journey
made
in
the
drowsy
heat
of
an
eastern
summer
are
indescribably
grateful
after
the
women
had
retired
from
the
bath
we
were
allowed
to
enter
the
interior
consisted
of
a
single
chamber
thirty
feet
high
vaulted
and
almost
dark
in
the
centre
was
a
large
basin
of
hot
water
filled
by
four
streams
which
poured
into
it
a
ledge
ran
around
the
sides
and
niches
in
the
wall
supplied
places
for
our
clothes
the
furnished
us
with
towels
and
we
undressed
and
plunged
in
the
water
was
agreeably
warm
about
had
a
sweet
taste
and
a
very
slight
sulphury
smell
the
vaulted
hall
redoubled
the
slightest
noise
and
a
shaven
turk
who
kept
us
company
sang
in
his
delight
that
he
might
hear
the
echo
of
his
own
voice
when
we
went
back
to
the
tent
we
found
our
visitor
lying
on
the
ground
trying
to
stay
his
hunger
it
was
rather
too
bad
in
us
to
light
our
pipes
make
a
sherbet
and
drink
and
smoke
in
his
face
while
we
joked
him
about
the
ramazan
and
he
at
last
got
up
and
walked
off
the
picture
of
distress
we
made
an
early
start
the
next
morning
and
rode
on
briskly
over
the
rolling
grassy
hills
a
beautiful
lake
with
an
island
in
it
lay
at
the
foot
of
emir
dagh
after
two
hours
we
reached
a
where
our
were
demanded
and
the
lazy
guardsman
invited
us
in
to
take
coffee
that
he
might
establish
a
right
to
the
backsheesh
which
he
could
not
demand
he
had
seen
us
afar
off
and
the
coffee
was
smoking
in
the
when
we
arrived
the
sun
was
already
terribly
hot
and
the
large
green
came
in
such
quantities
that
i
seemed
to
be
riding
in
the
midst
of
a
swarm
of
bees
my
horse
suffered
very
much
and
struck
out
his
hind
feet
so
violently
in
his
endeavors
to
get
rid
of
them
that
he
racked
every
joint
in
my
body
they
were
not
content
with
sucking
his
blood
but
settling
on
the
small
segment
of
my
calf
exposed
between
the
big
tartar
boot
and
the
flowing
trowsers
bit
through
my
stockings
with
fierce
bills
i
killed
hundreds
of
them
to
no
purpose
and
at
last
to
relieve
my
horse
tied
a
bunch
of
hawthorn
to
a
string
by
which
i
swung
it
under
his
belly
and
against
the
inner
side
of
his
flanks
in
this
way
i
gave
him
some
relief
a
service
which
he
acknowledged
by
a
grateful
motion
of
his
head
as
we
descended
towards
the
country
became
exceedingly
rich
and
luxuriant
the
range
of
sultan
dagh
the
mountain
of
the
sultan
rose
on
our
left
its
sides
covered
with
a
thick
screen
of
shrubbery
and
its
highest
peak
dotted
with
patches
of
snow
opposite
the
lower
range
of
emir
dagh
the
mountain
of
the
prince
lay
blue
and
bare
in
the
sun
shine
the
base
of
sultan
dagh
was
girdled
with
groves
of
stretching
out
in
long
lines
on
the
plain
with
fields
of
ripening
wheat
between
in
the
distance
the
large
lake
of
glittered
in
the
sun
towards
the
the
plain
stretched
away
for
fifty
miles
before
reaching
the
hills
it
is
evidently
on
a
much
lower
level
than
the
plain
of
konia
the
heat
was
not
only
greater
but
the
season
was
further
advanced
wheat
was
nearly
ready
for
cutting
and
the
where
the
day
previous
the
men
were
making
their
first
incisions
for
opium
here
had
yielded
their
harvest
and
were
fast
ripening
their
seed
is
beautifully
situated
at
the
entrance
of
a
deep
gorge
in
the
mountains
it
is
so
buried
in
its
embowered
gardens
that
little
except
the
mosque
is
seen
as
you
approach
it
it
is
a
large
place
and
boasts
a
fine
mosque
but
contains
nothing
worth
seeing
the
bazaar
after
that
of
konia
was
the
largest
we
had
seen
since
leaving
tarsus
the
greater
part
of
the
shopkeepers
lay
at
full
length
dozing
sleeping
or
staying
their
appetites
till
the
sunset
gun
we
found
some
superb
cherries
and
plenty
of
snow
which
is
brought
down
from
the
mountain
the
natives
were
very
friendly
and
but
seemed
surprised
at
harrison
tasting
the
cherries
although
i
told
them
we
were
upon
a
journey
our
tent
was
pitched
under
a
splendid
walnut
tree
outside
of
the
town
the
green
mountain
rose
between
us
and
the
fading
sunset
and
the
yellow
moon
was
hanging
in
the
east
as
we
took
our
dinner
at
the
turks
were
riding
homewards
on
donkeys
with
loads
of
grass
which
they
had
been
cutting
in
the
meadows
the
gun
was
fired
and
the
shouts
of
the
children
announced
the
close
of
the
day
fast
while
the
sweet
melancholy
voice
of
a
boy
muezzin
called
us
to
sunset
prayer
from
the
minaret
leaving
this
morning
we
rode
along
the
base
of
sultan
dagh
the
plain
which
we
overlooked
was
magnificent
the
wilderness
of
shrubbery
which
fringed
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
gave
place
to
great
orchards
and
gardens
interspersed
with
fields
of
grain
which
extended
far
out
on
the
plain
to
the
wild
thickets
and
wastes
of
reeds
surrounding
the
lake
the
sides
of
sultan
dagh
were
terraced
and
cultivated
wherever
it
was
practicable
and
i
saw
some
fields
of
wheat
high
up
on
the
mountain
there
were
many
people
in
the
road
or
laboring
in
the
fields
and
during
the
forenoon
we
passed
several
large
villages
the
country
is
more
thickly
inhabited
and
has
a
more
thrifty
and
prosperous
air
than
any
part
of
asia
minor
which
i
have
seen
the
people
are
better
clad
have
more
open
honest
cheerful
and
intelligent
faces
and
exhibit
a
genuine
courtesy
and
in
their
demeanor
towards
us
i
never
felt
more
perfectly
secure
or
more
certain
of
being
among
people
whom
i
could
trust
we
passed
under
the
summit
of
sultan
dagh
which
shone
out
so
clear
and
distinct
in
the
morning
sun
that
i
could
scarcely
realize
its
actual
height
above
the
plain
from
a
tremendous
gorge
cleft
between
the
two
higher
peaks
issued
a
large
stream
which
divided
into
a
hundred
channels
fertilizes
a
wide
extent
of
plain
about
two
hours
from
we
passed
a
splendid
fountain
of
crystal
water
gushing
up
beside
the
road
i
believe
it
is
the
same
called
by
some
travellers
the
fountain
of
midas
but
am
ignorant
wherefore
the
name
is
given
it
we
rode
for
several
hours
through
a
succession
of
grand
rich
landscapes
a
smaller
lake
succeeded
to
that
of
emir
dagh
rose
higher
in
the
sky
and
sultan
dagh
showed
other
peaks
broken
and
striped
with
snow
but
around
us
were
the
same
glorious
orchards
and
gardens
the
same
wheat
and
rustling
phalanxes
of
poppies
armies
of
vegetable
beside
the
bristling
and
bearded
cavaliers
the
sun
was
intensely
hot
during
the
afternoon
as
we
crossed
the
plain
and
i
became
so
drowsed
that
it
required
an
agony
of
exertion
to
keep
from
tumbling
off
my
horse
we
here
left
the
great
to
constantinople
and
took
a
less
frequented

became

and

there
were
vast
wastes
of
luxuriant
grass
whereon
thousands
of

buffaloes
were
feeding
a
stone
causeway
containing
many
elegant
fragments
of
ancient
sculpture
extended
across
this
part
of
the
plain
but
we
took
a
summer
path
beside
it
through
beds
of
iris
in
bloom
a
fragile
snowy
blossom
with
a
lip
of
the
clearest

hue
the
causeway
led
to
a
bare
salt
plain
beyond
which
we
came
to
the
town
of
bolawadün
and
terminated
our
day
journey
of
forty
miles
bolawadün
is
a
collection
of
mud
houses
about
a
mile
long
situated
on
an
eminence
at
the
western
base
of
emir
dagh
i
went
into
the
bazaar
which
was
a
small
place
and
not
very
well
supplied
though
as
it
was
near
sunset
there
was
quite
a
crowd
of
people
and
the
bakers
were
shovelling
out
their
fresh
bread
at
a
brisk
rate
every
one
took
me
for
a
good
egyptian
mohammedan
and
i
was
jostled
right
and
left
among
the
turbans
in
a
manner
that
certainly
would
not
have
happened
me
had
i
not
also
worn
one
who
had
fallen
behind
the
caravan
came
up
after
we
had
encamped
and
might
have
wandered
a
long
time
without
finding
us
but
for
the
efforts
of
the
inhabitants
to
set
him
aright
this
evening
he
knocked
over
a
hedgehog
mistaking
it
for
a
cat
the
poor
creature
was
severely
hurt
and
its
sobs
of
distress
precisely
like
those
of
a
little
child
were
to
painful
to
hear
that

were

to

reached

a

which
was

and

by

yet
inclosing
in
its
depths
many
curious
relics
of
antiquity
leaving

ascended

sultan

along
whose

we
had
travelled
the
previous
day
lay
high
and
blue
in
the
background
streaked
with
shining
snow
and
far
away
behind
it
arose
a
still
higher
peak
hoary
with
the
lingering
winter
we
descended
into
a
grassy
plain
shut
in
by
a
range
of
broken
mountains
covered
to
their
summits
with
shrubbery
through
which
the
strata
of
marble
rock
gleamed
like
patches
of
snow
the
hills
in
front
were
scarred
with
old
quarries
once
worked
for
the
celebrated
phrygian
marble
there
was
neither
a
habitation
nor
a
human
being
to
be
seen
and
the
landscape
had
a
singularly
wild
lonely
and
picturesque
air
turning
westward
we
crossed
a
high
rolling
tract
and
entered
a
valley
entirely
covered
with
dwarf
oaks
and
cedars
in
spite
of
the
dusty
road
the
heat
and
the
multitude
of
the
journey
presented
an
agreeable
contrast
to
the
great
plains
over
which
we
had
been
travelling
for
many
days
the
opposite
side
of
the
glen
was
crowned
with
a
tall
crest
of
shattered
rock
in
which
were
many
old
phrygian
tombs
they
were
mostly
simple
chambers
with
square
apertures
there
were
traces
of
many
more
the
rock
having
been
blown
up
or
quarried
down
the
tombs
instead
of
protecting
it
only
furnishing
one
facility
the
more
for
destruction
after
an
hour
rest
at
a
fountain
we
threaded
the
windings
of
the
glen
to
a
lower
plain
quite
shut
in
by
the
hills
whose
ribs
of
marble
showed
through
the
forests
of
oak
holly
cedar
and
pine
which
dotted
them
we
were
now
fully
entered
into
the
and
our
road
passed
over
heights
and
through
hollows
covered
with
picturesque
clumps
of
foliage
it
resembled
some
of
the
wild
western
downs
of
america
and
but
for
the
phrygian
tombs
whose
doorways
stared
at
us
from
every
rock
seemed
as
little
familiar
with
the
presence
of
man
hadji
youssuf
in
stopping
to
arrange
some
of
the
baggage
lost
his
hold
of
his
mule
and
in
spite
of
every
effort
to
secure
her
the
provoking
beast
kept
her
liberty
for
the
rest
of
the
day
in
vain
did
we
head
her
off
chase
her
coax
her
set
traps
for
her
she
was
too
cunning
to
be
taken
in
and
marched
along
at
her
ease
running
into
every
field
of
grain
stopping
to
crop
the
choicest
bunches
of
grass
or
walking
demurely
in
the
caravan
allowing
the
hadji
to
come
within
arm
length
before
she
kicked
up
her
heels
and
dashed
away
again
we
had
a
long
chase
through
the
clumps
of
oak
and
holly
but
all
to
no
purpose
the
great
green
swarmed
around
us
biting
myself
as
well
as
my
horse
hecatombs
crushed
by
my
whip
dropped
dead
in
the
dust
but
the
ranks
were
immediately
filled
from
some
invisible
reserve
the
soil
was
no
longer
bare
but
entirely
covered
with
grass
and
flowers
in
one
of
the
valleys
i
saw
a
large
patch
of
the
crimson
larkspur
so
thick
as
to
resemble
a
pool
of
blood
while
crossing
a
long
hot
hill
we
came
upon
a
little
arbor
of
stones
covered
with
pine
branches
it
inclosed
an
ancient
sarcophagus
of
marble
nearly
filled
with
water
beside
it
stood
a
square
cup
with
a
handle
rudely
hewn
out
of
a
piece
of
pine
wood
this
was
a
charitable
provision
for
travellers
and
constantly
supplied
by
the
turcomans
who
lived
in
the
vicinity
the
last
two
hours
of
our
journey
that
day
were
through
a
glorious
forest
of
pines
the
road
lay
in
a
winding
glen
green
and
grassy
and
covered
to
the
summits
on
both
sides
with
beautiful
pine
trees
intermixed
with
cedar
the
air
had
the
true
northern
aroma
and
was
more
grateful
than
wine
every
turn
of
the
glen
disclosed
a
charming
woodland
view
it
was
a
wild
valley
of
the
northern
hills
filled
with
the
burning
lustre
of
a
summer
sun
and
canopied
by
the
brilliant
blue
of
a
summer
sky
there
were
signs
of
the
woodman
axe
and
the
charred
embers
of
forest
i
thought
of
the
lovely
in
the
pine
forests
behind
monterey
and
could
really
have
imagined
myself
there
towards
evening
we
reached
a
solitary
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
the
glen
here
opened
a
little
and
a
stone
fountain
of
delicious
water
furnished
all
that
we
wanted
for
a
the
house
was
inhabited
by
three
soldiers
sturdy
fellows
who
immediately
spread
a
mat
in
the
shade
for
us
and
made
us
some
excellent
coffee
a
turcoman
encampment
in
the
neighborhood
supplied
us
with
milk
and
eggs
the
guardsmen
were
good
mussulmans
and
took
us
for
the
same
one
of
them
asked
me
to
let
him
know
when
the
sun
was
down
and
i
prolonged
his
fast
until
it
was
quite
dark
when
i
gave
him
permission
to
eat
they
all
had
tolerable
stallions
for
their
service
and
seemed
to
live
pleasantly
enough
in
their
wild
way
the
fat
stumpy
corporal
with
his
enormously
broad
pantaloons
and
automaton
legs
went
down
to
the
fountain
with
his
musket
and
after
taking
a
rest
and
sighting
full
five
minutes
fired
at
a
dove
without
hitting
it
he
afterwards
joined
us
in
a
social
pipe
and
we
sat
on
a
carpet
at
the
door
of
the
watching
the
splendid
moonrise
through
the
pine
boughs
when
the
pipes
had
burned
out
i
went
to
bed
and
slept
a
long
sweet
sleep
until
dawn
we
knew
that
the
tombs
of
the
phrygian
kings
could
not
be
far
off
and
on
making
inquiries
of
the
corporal
found
that
he
knew
the
place
it
was
not
four
hours
distant
by
a
and
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
reach
it
without
a
guide
he
would
give
us
one
of
his
men
in
consideration
of
a
fee
of
twenty
piastres
the
difficulty
was
evident
in
a
hilly
wooded
country
like
this
traversed
by
a
labyrinth
of
valleys
and
ravines
and
so
we
accepted
the
soldier
as
we
were
about
leaving
an
old
turcoman
whose
beard
was
dyed
a
bright
red
came
up
saying
that
he
knew
was
a
physician
and
could
cure
him
of
his
deafness
the
morning
air
was
sweet
with
the
breath
of
cedar
and
pine
and
we
rode
on
through
the
woods
and
over
the
open
turfy
glades
in
high
spirits
we
were
in
the
heart
of
a
mountainous
country
clothed
with
evergreen
forests
except
some
open
upland
tracts
which
showed
a
thick
green
turf
dotted
all
over
with
clumps
and
single
great
trees
the
pines
were
noble
trunks
often
sixty
to
eighty
feet
high
and
with
boughs
disposed
in
all
possible
picturesqueness
of
form
the
cedar
frequently
showed
a
solid
white
bole
three
feet
in
diameter
we
took
a
winding
footpath
often
a
mere
track
striking
across
the
hills
in
a
northern
direction
everywhere
we
met
the
turks
of
the
plain
who
are
now
encamped
in
the
mountains
to
tend
their
flocks
through
the
summer
months
herds
of
sheep
and
goats
were
scattered
over
the
green
and
the
idle
basked
in
the
morning
sun
playing
lively
airs
on
a
reed
flute
resembling
the
arabic
here
and
there
was
a
woodman
busy
at
a
recently
felled
tree
and
we
met
several
of
the
creaking
carts
of
the
country
hauling
logs
all
that
we
saw
had
a
pleasant
rural
air
a
smack
of
primitive
and
unsophisticated
life
from
the
higher
ridges
over
which
we
passed
we
could
see
far
to
the
east
and
west
other
ranges
of
mountains
and
in
the
distance
the
cloudy
lines
of
loftier
chains
the
trunks
of
the
pines
were
nearly
all
charred
and
many
of
the
smaller
trees
dead
from
the
fires
which
later
in
the
year
rage
in
these
forests
after
four
hours
of
varied
and
most
inspiring
travel
we
reached
a
district
covered
for
the
most
part
with
oak
woods
a
more
open
though
still
mountainous
region
there
was
a
summer
village
of
turks
scattered
over
the
nearest
slope
probably
fifty
houses
in
all
almost
perfect
counterparts
of
western
they
were
built
of
pine
logs
laid
crosswise
and
covered
with
rough
boards
these
as
we
were
told
were
the
dwellings
of
the
people
who
inhabit
the
village
of
khosref
pasha
khan
during
the
winter
great
numbers
of
sheep
and
goats
were
browsing
over
the
hills
or
lying
around
the
doors
of
the
houses
the
latter
were
beautiful
creatures
with
heavy
curved
horns
and
long
white
silky
hair
that
entirely
hid
their
eyes
we
stopped
at
a
house
for
water
which
the
man
brought
out
in
a
little
cask
he
at
first
proposed
giving
us
and
his
wife
suggested
sweet
curds
which
we
agreed
to
take
but
it
proved
to
be
only
boiled
milk
leaving
the
village
we
took
a
path
leading
westward
mounted
a
long
hill
and
again
entered
the
pine
forests
before
long
we
came
to
a
somewhat
resembling
a
swiss
cottage
it
was
two
stories
high
and
there
was
an
upper
balcony
with
cushioned
divans
overlooking
a
thriving
and
some
three
or
four
men
were
weeding
in
the
garden
and
the
owner
came
up
and
welcomed
us
a
fountain
of
water
gushed
into
a
stone
trough
at
the
door
making
a
tempting
spot
for
our
breakfast
but
we
were
bent
on
reaching
the
tombs
there
were
convenient
for
fowls
sheep
and
cattle
the
herds
were
out
grazing
along
the
edges
of
the
forest
and
we
heard
the
shrill
joyous
melodies
of
the
flutes
blown
by
the
we
now
reached
a
ridge
whence
we
looked
down
through
the
forest
upon
a
long
valley
nearly
half
a
mile
wide
and
bordered
on
the
opposite
side
by
ranges
of
broken
sandstone
crags
this
was
the
place
we
sought
the
valley
of
the
phrygian
tombs
already
we
could
distinguish
the
hewn
faces
of
the
rocks
and
the
dark
apertures
to
the
chambers
within
the
bottom
of
the
valley
was
a
bed
of
glorious
grass
blazoned
with
flowers
and
redolent
of
all
vernal
smells
several
peasants
finding
it
too
hot
to
mow
had
thrown
their
scythes
along
the
swarths
and
were
lying
in
the
shade
of
an
oak
we
rode
over
the
hay
up
the
opposite
side
and
dismounted
at
the
face
of
the
crags
as
we
approached
them
the
number
of
chambers
hewn
in
the
rock
the
doors
and
niches
now
open
to
the
day
surmounted
by
shattered
spires
and
turrets
gave
the
whole
mass
the
appearance
of
a
grand
fortress
in
ruins
the
crags
which
are
of
a
very
soft
sandstone
rise
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
from
their
base
and
their
summits
are
worn
by
the
weather
into
the
most
remarkable
forms
the
principal
monument
is
a
broad
projecting
cliff
one
side
of
which
has
been
cut
so
as
to
resemble
the
façade
of
a
temple
the
sculptured
part
is
about
sixty
feet
high
by
sixty
in
breadth
and
represents
a
solid
wall
with
two
pilasters
at
the
ends
upholding
an
architrave
and
pediment
which
is
surmounted
by
two
large
volutes
the
whole
face
of
the
wall
is
covered
with
ornaments
resembling
not
in
regular
squares
but
a
labyrinth
of
intricate
designs
in
the
centre
at
the
bottom
is
a
shallow
square
recess
surrounded
by
an
elegant
though
plain
moulding
but
there
is
no
appearance
of
an
entrance
to
the
sepulchral
chamber
which
may
be
hidden
in
the
heart
of
the
rock
there
is
an
inscription
in
greek
running
up
one
side
but
it
is
of
a
later
date
than
the
work
itself
on
one
of
the
tombs
there
is
an
inscription
to
king
midas
these
relics
are
supposed
to
date
from
the
period
of
the
gordian
dynasty
about
seven
centuries
before
christ
a
little
in
front
of
a
headland
formed
by
the
summit
walls
of
two
meeting
valleys
rises
a
mass
of
rocks
one
hundred
feet
high
cut
into
sepulchral
chambers
story
above
story
with
the
traces
of
steps
between
them
leading
to
others
still
higher
the
whole
rock
which
may
be
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
by
fifty
feet
broad
has
been
scooped
out
leaving
but
narrow
partitions
to
separate
the
chambers
of
the
dead
these
chambers
are
all
plain
but
some
are
of
very
elegant
proportions
with
arched
or
pyramidal
roofs
and
arched
recesses
at
the
sides
containing
sarcophagi
hewn
in
the
solid
stone
there
are
also
many
niches
for
cinerary
urns
the
principal
tomb
had
a
portico
supported
by
columns
but
the
front
is
now
entirely
hurled
down
and
only
the
elegant
panelling
and
stone
joists
of
the
ceiling
remain
the
entire
hill
was
a
succession
of
tombs
there
is
not
a
rock
which
does
not
bear
traces
of
them
i
might
have
counted
several
hundred
within
a
stone
throw
the
position
of
these
curious
remains
in
a
lonely
valley
shut
in
on
all
sides
by
dark
mountains
of
which
are
crowned
with
a
natural
acropolis
of
rock
resembling
a
fortress
increases
the
interest
with
which
they
inspire
the
beholder
the
valley
on
the
western
side
with
its
bed
of
ripe
wheat
in
the
bottom
its
tall
walls
towers
and
pinnacles
of
rock
and
its
distant
vista
of
mountain
and
forest
is
the
most
picturesque
in
phrygia
the
turcoman
reapers
who
came
up
to
see
us
and
talk
with
us
said
that
there
were
the
remains
of
walls
on
the
summit
of
the
principal
acropolis
opposite
us
and
that
further
up
the
valley
there
was
a
chamber
with
two
columns
in
front
harrison
and
i
saddled
and
rode
off
passing
along
a
wall
of
fantastic
at
the
base
of
which
was
a
natural
column
about
ten
feet
high
and
five
in
diameter
almost
perfectly
round
and
upholding
an
immense
rock
shaped
like
a
cocked
hat
in
crossing
the
meadow
we
saw
a
turk
sitting
in
the
sun
beside
a
spring
and
busily
engaged
in
knitting
a
stocking
after
a
ride
of
two
miles
we
found
the
chamber
hewn
like
the
façade
of
a
temple
in
an
isolated
rock
overlooking
two
valleys
of
wild
the
pediment
and
cornice
were
simple
and
beautiful
but
the
columns
had
been
broken
away
the
chambers
were
perfectly
plain
but
the
on
the
ceiling
of
the
portico
was
entire
after
passing
three
hours
in
examining
these
tombs
we
took
the
track
which
our
guide
pointed
out
as
the
road
to
kiutahya
we
rode
two
hours
through
the
forest
and
came
out
upon
a
wooded
height
overlooking
a
grand
open
valley
rich
in
and
pasture
land
while
i
was
contemplating
this
lovely
view
the
road
turned
a
corner
of
the
ridge
and
lo
before
me
there
appeared
as
i
thought
above
the
tops
of
the
pines
high
up
on
the
mountain
side
a
line
of
enormous
tents
those
cones
uprearing
their
sharp
spires
and
spreading
out
their
broad
bases
what
could
they
be
but
an
encampment
of
monster
tents
yet
no
they
were
pinnacles
of
white
rock
perfect
cones
from
thirty
to
one
hundred
feet
in
height
twelve
in
all
and
ranged
side
by
side
along
the
edge
of
the
cliff
with
the
precision
of
a
military
camp
they
were
perfectly
smooth
and
full
and
their
bases
touched
what
made
the
spectacle
more
singular
there
was
no
other
appearance
of
the
same
rock
on
the
mountain
all
around
them
was
the
of
the
pines
out
of
which
they
rose
like
drifted
horns
of
unbroken
snow
i
named
this
singular
phenomenon
which
seems
to
have
escaped
the
notice
of
travellers
the
titan
camp
in
another
hour
we
reached
a
fountain
near
the
village
of
kümbeh
and
pitched
our
tents
for
the
night
the
village
which
is
half
a
mile
in
length
is
built
upon
a
singular
crag
which
shoots
up
abruptly
from
the
centre
of
the
valley
rising
at
one
extremity
to
a
height
of
more
than
a
hundred
feet
it
was
entirely
deserted
the
inhabitants
having
all
gone
off
to
the
mountains
with
their
herds
the
solitary
muezzin
who
cried
the
at
the
close
of
the
fast
and
lighted
the
lamps
on
his
minaret
went
through
with
his
work
in
most
unclerical
haste
now
that
there
was
no
one
to
notice
him
we
sent
achmet
the
to
the
mountain
camp
of
the
villagers
to
procure
a
supply
of
fowls
and
barley
we
rose
very
early
yesterday
morning
shivering
in
the
cold
air
of
the
mountains
and
just
as
the
sun
bursting
through
the
pines
looked
down
the
little
hollow
where
our
tents
were
pitched
set
the
caravan
in
motion
the
ride
down
the
valley
was
charming
the
land
was
naturally
rich
and
highly
cultivated
which
made
its
desertion
the
more
singular
leagues
of
wheat
rye
and
poppies
spread
around
us
left
for
the
summer
warmth
to
do
its
silent
work
the
dew
sparkled
on
the
fields
as
we
rode
through
them
and
the
splendor
of
the
flowers
in
blossom
was
equal
to
that
of
the
plains
of
palestine
there
were
purple
white
and
scarlet
poppies
the
rich
crimson
larkspur
the
red
anemone
the
golden
daisy
the
pink
convolvulus
and
a
host
of
smaller
blooms
so
intensely
bright
and
dazzling
in
their
hues
that
the
meadows
were
richer
than
a
pavement
of
precious
jewels
to
look
towards
the
sun
over
a
field
of
scarlet
poppies
was
like
looking
on
a
bed
of
live
coals
the
light
striking
through
the
petals
made
them
burn
as
with
an
inward
fire
out
of
this
wilderness
of
gorgeous
color
rose
the
tall
spires
of
a
larger
plant
covered
with
great
yellow
flowers
while
here
and
there
the
snowy
blossoms
of
a
clump
of
hawthorn
sweetened
the
morning
air
a
short
distance
beyond
kümbeh
we
passed
another
group
of
ancient
tombs
one
of
which
was
of
curious
design
an
isolated
rock
thirty
feet
in
height
by
twenty
in
diameter
was
cut
so
as
to
resemble
a
triangular
tower
with
the
apex
bevelled
a
chamber
containing
a
sarcophagus
was
hewn
out
of
the
interior
the
entrance
was
ornamented
with
double
columns
in
and
a
pediment
there
was
another
arched
chamber
cut
directly
through
the
base
of
the
triangle
with
a
niche
on
each
side
hollowed
out
at
the
bottom
so
as
to
form
a
sarcophagus
leaving
these
the
last
of
the
phrygian
tombs
we
struck
across
the
valley
and
ascended
a
high
range
of
hills
covered
with
pine
to
an
upland
wooded
region
here
we
found
a
summer
village
of
log
cabins
scattered
over
a
grassy
slope
the
people
regarded
us
with
some
curiosity
and
the
women
hastily
concealed
their
faces
rode
up
to
a
large
new
house
and
peeped
in
between
the
logs
there
were
several
women
inside
who
started
up
in
great
confusion
and
threw
over
their
heads
whatever
article
was
most
convenient
an
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
neatly
dressed
in
a
green
jacket
and
shawl
turban
came
out
and
welcomed
us
i
asked
for
which
he
promised
and
immediately
brought
out
a
carpet
and
spread
it
on
the
ground
then
followed
a
large
basin
of
kaïmak
with
wooden
spoons
three
loaves
of
bread
and
a
plate
of
cheese
we
seated
ourselves
on
the
carpet
and
delved
in
with
the
spoons
while
the
old
man
retired
lest
his
appetite
should
be
provoked
the
milk
was
excellent
nor
were
the
bread
and
cheese
to
be
despised
while
we
were
eating
the
khowagee
or
schoolmaster
of
the
community
a
genteel
little
man
in
a
round
white
turban
came
op
to
inquire
of
françois
who
we
were
that
effendi
in
the
blue
dress
said
he
is
the
bey
is
he
not
yes
said
and
the
other
with
the
striped
shirt
and
white
turban
is
a
writer
here
he
was
not
far
wrong
but
how
is
it
that
the
effendis
do
not
speak
turkish
he
persisted
because
said
françois
their
fathers
were
exiled
by
sultan
mahmoud
when
they
were
small
children
they
have
grown
up
in
aleppo
like
arabs
and
have
not
yet
learned
turkish
but
god
grant
that
the
sultan
may
not
turn
his
face
away
from
them
and
that
they
may
regain
the
rank
their
fathers
once
had
in
stamboul
god
grant
it
replied
the
khowagee
greatly
interested
in
the
story
by
this
time
we
had
eaten
our
full
share
of
the
kaïmak
which
was
finished
by
françois
and
the
katurgees
the
old
man
now
came
up
mounted
on
a
dun
mare
stating
that
he
was
bound
for
kiutahya
and
was
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
travelling
in
such
good
company
i
gave
one
of
his
young
children
some
money
as
the
kaïmak
was
tendered
out
of
pure
hospitality
and
so
we
rode
off
our
new
companion
was
armed
to
the
teeth
having
a
long
gun
with
a
heavy
wooden
stock
and
nondescript
lock
and
a
sword
of
excellent
metal
it
was
in
fact
a
weapon
of
the
old
greek
empire
and
the
cross
was
still
enamelled
in
gold
at
the
root
of
the
blade
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
scratch
it
out
he
was
something
of
a
having
made
a
pilgrimage
to
mecca
and
jerusalem
he
was
very
inquisitive
plying
françois
with
questions
about
the
government
the
latter
answered
that
we
were
not
connected
with
the
government
but
the
old
fellow
shrewdly
hinted
that
he
knew
better
we
were
persons
of
rank
travelling
incognito
he
was
very
attentive
to
us
offering
us
water
at
every
fountain
although
he
believed
us
to
be
good
mussulmans
we
found
him
of
some
service
as
a
guide
shortening
our
road
by
taking
through
the
woods
for
several
hours
we
traversed
a
beautifully
wooded
region
of
hills
graceful
clumps
of
pine
shaded
the
grassy
knolls
where
the
sheep
and
goats
were
basking
at
rest
and
the
air
was
filled
with
a
warm
summer
smell
blown
from
the
banks
of
golden
broom
now
and
then
from
the
thickets
of
laurel
and
arbutus
a
shrill
shepherd
reed
piped
some
joyous
woodland
melody
was
it
a
faun
astray
among
the
hills
green
dells
open
to
the
sunshine
and
beautiful
as
dreams
of
arcady
divided
the
groves
of
pine
the
sky
overhead
was
pure
and
cloudless
clasping
the
landscape
with
its
belt
of
peace
and
silence
oh
that
delightful
region
haunted
by
all
the
bright
spirits
of
the
immortal
grecian
song
chased
away
from
the
rest
of
the
earth
here
they
have
found
a
home
here
secret
altars
remain
to
them
from
the
times
that
are
departed
out
of
these
woods
we
passed
into
a
lonely
plain
inclosed
by
piny
hills
that
brightened
in
the
thin
pure
ether
in
the
distance
were
some
shepherds
tents
and
musical
tinkled
along
the
edges
of
the
woods
from
the
crest
of
a
lofty
ridge
beyond
this
plain
we
looked
back
over
the
wild
solitudes
wherein
we
had
been
travelling
for
two
days
long
ranges
of
dark
hills
fading
away
behind
each
other
with
a
perspective
that
hinted
of
the
hidden
gulfs
between
from
the
western
slope
a
still
more
extensive
prospect
opened
before
us
over
ridges
covered
with
forests
of
oak
and
pine
we
saw
the
valley
of
the
pursek
the
ancient
thymbrius
stretching
far
away
to
the
misty
line
of
keshish
dagh
the
mountains
behind
kintahya
loomed
up
high
and
grand
making
a
fine
feature
in
the
middle
distance
we
caught
but
fleeting
glimpses
of
the
view
through
the
trees
and
then
plunging
into
the
forest
again
descended
to
a
cultivated
slope
whereon
there
was
a
little
village
now
deserted
the
graveyard
beside
it
was
shaded
with
large
and
near
it
there
was
a
fountain
of
excellent
water
here
said
the
old
man
you
can
wash
and
pray
and
then
rest
awhile
under
the
trees
françois
excused
us
by
saying
that
while
on
a
journey
we
always
bathed
before
praying
but
not
to
slight
his
faith
entirely
i
washed
my
hands
and
face
before
sitting
down
to
our
scanty
breakfast
of
bread
and
water
our
path
now
led
down
through
long
winding
glens
over
grown
with
oaks
from
which
the
wild
yellow
honeysuckles
fell
in
a
shower
of
blossoms
as
we
drew
near
the
valley
the
old
man
began
to
hint
that
his
presence
had
been
of
great
service
to
us
and
deserved
recompense
god
knows
said
he
to
françois
in
what
corner
of
the
mountains
you
might
now
be
if
i
had
not
accompanied
you
oh
replied
françois
there
are
always
plenty
of
people
among
the
woods
who
would
have
been
equally
as
kind
as
yourself
in
showing
us
the
way
he
then
spoke
of
the
robbers
in
the
neighborhood
and
pointed
out
some
graves
by
the
as
those
of
persons
who
had
been
murdered
but
he
added
everybody
in
these
parts
knows
me
and
whoever
is
in
company
with
me
is
always
safe
the
greek
assured
him
that
we
always
depended
on
ourselves
for
our
safety
defeated
on
these
tacks
he
boldly
affirmed
that
his
services
were
worthy
of
payment
but
said
françois
you
told
us
at
the
village
that
you
had
business
in
kiutahya
and
would
be
glad
to
join
us
for
the
sake
of
having
company
on
the
road
well
then
rejoined
the
old
fellow
making
a
last
effort
i
leave
the
matter
to
your
politeness
certainly
replied
the
imperturbable
dragoman
we
could
not
be
so
impolite
as
to
offer
money
to
a
man
of
your
wealth
and
station
we
could
not
insult
you
by
giving
you
alms
the
old
turcoman
thereupon
gave
a
shrug
and
a
grunt
made
a
sullen
salutation
and
left
us
it
was
nearly
six
when
we
reached
the
pursek
there
was
no
sign
of
the
city
but
we
could
barely
discern
an
old
fortress
on
the
lofty
cliff
which
commands
the
town
a
long
stone
bridge
crossed
the
river
which
here
separates
into
half
a
dozen
channels
the
waters
are
swift
and
clear
and
wind
away
in
devious
mazes
through
the
broad
green
meadows
we
hurried
on
thinking
we
saw
minarets
in
the
distance
but
they
proved
to
be
poplars
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
and
finally
went
down
before
there
was
any
token
of
our
being
in
the
vicinity
of
the
city
soon
however
a
line
of
tiled
roofs
appeared
along
the
slope
of
a
hill
on
our
left
and
turning
its
base
we
saw
the
city
before
us
filling
the
mouth
of
a
deep
valley
or
gorge
which
opened
from
the
mountains
but
the
horses
are
saddled
and
françois
tells
me
it
is
time
to
put
up
my
pen
we
are
off
over
the
mountains
to
the
greek
city
of
oezani
in
the
valley
of
the
rhyndacus

more
of
the
things
to
come
than
the
things
before
daghje
köi
on
the
rhyndacus
on
entering
kiutahya
we
passed
the
barracks
which
were
the
residence
of
kossuth
and
his
companions
in
exile
beyond
them
we
came
to
a
broad
street
down
which
flowed
the
vilest
stream
of
filth
of
which
even
a
turkish
city
could
ever
boast
the
houses
on
either
side
were
two
stories
high
the
upper
part
of
wood
with
hanging
balconies
over
which
shot
the
eaves
of
the
tiled
roofs
the
welcome
cannon
had
just
sounded
announcing
the
close
of
the
day
fast
the
were
already
crowded
with
lean
and
hungry
customers
the
pipes
were
filled
and
lighted
and
the
coffee
smoked
in
the
finjans
in
half
a
minute
such
whiffs
arose
on
all
sides
as
it
would
have
cheered
the
heart
of
a
genuine
smoker
to
behold
out
of
these
cheerful
places
we
passed
into
other
streets
which
were
entirely
deserted
the
inhabitants
being
at
dinner
it
had
a
weird
uncomfortable
effect
to
ride
through
streets
where
the
clatter
of
our
horses
hoofs
was
the
only
sound
of
life
at
last
we
reached
the
entrance
to
a
bazaar
and
near
it
a
khan
a
new
khan
very
neatly
built
and
with
a
spare
room
so
much
better
than
we
expected
that
we
congratulated
ourselves
heartily
we
unpacked
in
a
hurry
and
françois
ran
off
to
the
bazaar
from
which
he
speedily
returned
with
some
roast
kid
cucumbers
and
cherries
we
lighted
two
lamps
i
borrowed
the
narghileh
and
françois
learning
that
it
was
our
national
anniversary
procured
us
a
flask
of
greek
wine
that
we
might
do
it
honor
the
beverage
however
resembled
a
mixture
of
vinegar
and
and
we
contented
ourselves
with
drinking
patriotic
toasts
in
two
finjans
of
excellent
coffee
but
in
the
midst
of
our
enjoyment
happening
to
cast
my
eye
on
the
walls
i
saw
a
sight
that
turned
all
our
honey
into
gall
scores
on
scores
nay
hundreds
on
hundreds
of
enormous
swarmed
on
the
plaster
and
were
already
descending
to
our
beds
and
baggage
to
sleep
there
was
impossible
but
we
succeeded
in
getting
possession
of
one
of
the
outside
balconies
where
we
made
our
beds
after
searching
them
thoroughly
in
the
evening
a
merchant
who
spoke
a
little
arabic
came
up
to
me
and
asked
is
not
your
excellency
friend
the
chief
physician
i
did
not
venture
to
assent
but
replied
no
he
is
a
this
was
beyond
his
comprehension
and
he
went
away
with
the
impression
that
was
much
greater
than
a
i
slept
soundly
on
my
bed
but
was
awakened
towards
morning
by
two
tremendous
claps
of
thunder
echoing
in
the
gorge
and
the
rattling
of
rain
on
the
roof
of
the
khan
i
spent
two
or
three
hours
next
morning
in
taking
a
survey
of
kiutahya
the
town
is
much
larger
than
i
had
supposed
i
should
judge
it
to
contain
from
fifty
to
sixty
thousand
inhabitants
the
situation
is
remarkable
and
gives
a
picturesque
effect
to
the
place
when
seen
from
above
which
makes
one
forget
its
internal
filth
it
is
built
in
the
mouth
of
a
gorge
and
around
the
bases
of
the
hills
on
either
side
the
lofty
mountains
which
rise
behind
it
supply
it
with
perpetual
springs
of
pure
water
at
every
dozen
steps
you
come
upon
a
fountain
and
every
large
street
has
a
brook
in
the
centre
the
houses
are
all
two
and
many
of
them
three
stories
high
with
hanging
balconies
which
remind
me
much
of
switzerland
the
bazaars
are
very
extensive
covering
all
the
base
of
the
hill
on
which
stands
the
ancient
citadel
the
goods
displayed
were
mostly
european
cotton
fabrics
boots
and
slippers
and
silks
in
the
parts
devoted
to
the
produce
of
the
country
i
saw
very
fine
cherries
cucumbers
and
lettuce
and
bundles
of
magnificent
clover
three
to
four
feet
high
we
climbed
a
steep
path
to
the
citadel
which
covers
the
summit
of
an
abrupt
isolated
hill
connected
by
a
shoulder
with
the
great
range
the
walls
are
nearly
a
mile
in
circuit
consisting
almost
wholly
of
immense
circular
buttresses
placed
so
near
each
other
that
they
almost
touch
the
connecting
walls
are
broken
down
on
the
northern
side
so
that
from
below
the
buttresses
have
the
appearance
of
enormous
shattered
columns
they
are
built
of
rough
stones
with
regular
layers
of
flat
burnt
bricks
on
the
highest
part
of
the
hill
stands
the
fortress
or
stronghold
a
place
which
must
have
been
almost
impregnable
before
the
invention
of
cannon
the
structure
probably
dates
from
the
ninth
or
tenth
century
but
is
built
on
the
foundations
of
more
ancient
edifices
the
old
greek
city
of
cotyaeum
whence
kiutahya
probably
stood
upon
this
hill
within
the
citadel
is
an
upper
town
containing
about
a
hundred
houses
the
residence
apparently
of
poor
families
from
the
circuit
of
the
walls
on
every
side
there
are
grand
views
over
the
plain
the
city
and
the
gorges
of
the
mountains
behind
the
valley
of
the
pursek
freshened
by
the
last
night
shower
spread
out
a
sheet
of
vivid
green
to
the
mountains
which
bounded
it
on
all
sides
around
the
city
it
was
adorned
with
groves
and
gardens
and
in
the
direction
of
brousa
white
roads
went
winding
away
to
other
gardens
and
villages
in
the
distance
the
mountains
of
phrygia
through
which
we
had
passed
were
the
loftiest
in
the
circle
that
inclosed
the
valley
the
city
at
our
feet
presented
a
thick
array
of
roofs
out
of
which
rose
here
and
there
the
taper
shaft
of
a
minaret
or
the
dome
of
a
mosque
or
bath
from
the
southern
side
of
the
citadel
we
looked
down
into
the
gorge
which
supplies
kiutahya
with
water
a
wild
desert
landscape
of
white
crags
and
shattered
peaks
of
gray
rock
hanging
over
a
narrow
winding
bed
of
the
greenest
foliage
instead
of
taking
the
direct
road
to
brousa
we
decided
to
make
a
detour
of
two
days
in
order
to
visit
the
ruins
of
the
old
greek
city
of
oezani
which
are
miles
south
of
kiutahya
leaving
at
noon
we
ascended
the
gorge
behind
the
city
by
delightfully
embowered
paths
at
first
under
the
eaves
of
superb
and
then
through
wild
thickets
of
willow
hazel
privet
and
other
shrubs
tangled
together
with
the
odorous
white
honeysuckle
near
the
city
the
were
bare
white
masses
of
gypsum
and
other
rock
in
many
places
with
the
purest
hue
but
as
we
advanced
they
were
clothed
to
the
summit
with
copsewood
the
streams
that
foamed
down
these
perennial
heights
were
led
into
buried
channels
to
come
to
light
again
in
sparkling
fountains
pouring
into
stone
basins
the
day
was
cool
and
cloudy
and
the
heavy
shadows
which
hung
on
the
great
sides
of
the
mountain
gateway
heightened
by
contrast
the
glory
of
the
sunlit
plain
seen
through
them
after
passing
the
summit
ridge
probably
feet
above
the
sea
we
came
upon
a
wooded
hilly
region
stretching
away
in
long
misty
lines
to
murad
dagh
whose
head
was
spotted
with
snow
there
were
patches
of
wheat
and
rye
in
the
hollows
and
the
bells
of
distant
herds
tinkled
occasionally
among
the
trees
there
was
no
village
on
the
road
and
we
were
on
the
way
to
one
which
we
saw
in
the
distance
when
we
came
upon
a
meadow
of
good
grass
with
a
small
stream
running
through
it
here
we
encamped
sending
achmet
the
katurgee
to
the
village
for
milk
and
eggs
the
ewes
had
just
been
milked
for
the
suppers
of
their
owners
but
they
went
over
the
flock
again
stripping
their
udders
which
greatly
improved
the
quality
of
the
milk
the
night
was
so
cold
that
i
could
scarcely
sleep
during
the
morning
hours
there
was
a
chill
heavy
dew
on
the
meadow
but
when
françois
awoke
me
at
sunrise
the
sky
was
splendidly
clear
and
pure
and
the
early
beams
had
a
little
warmth
in
them
our
coffee
before
starting
made
with
sheep
milk
was
the
richest
i
ever
drank
after
riding
for
two
hours
across
broad
wild
ridges
covered
with
cedar
we
reached
a
height
overlooking
the
valley
of
the
rhyndacus
or
rather
the
plain
whence
he
draws
his
sources
a
circular
level
ten
or
twelve
miles
in
diameter
and
contracting
towards
the
west
into
a
narrow
dell
through
which
his
waters
find
outlet
several
villages
each
embowered
in
gardens
were
scattered
along
the
bases
of
the
hills
that
inclose
it
we
took
the
wrong
road
but
were
set
aright
by
a
herdsman
and
after
threading
a
lane
between
thriving
were
cheered
by
the
sight
of
the
temple
of
oezani
lifted
on
its
acropolis
above
the
orchards
of
chavdür
and
standing
out
sharp
and
clear
against
the
purple
of
the
hills
our
approach
to
the
city
was
marked
by
the
blocks
of
sculptured
marble
that
lined
the
way
elegant
mouldings
cornices
and
entablatures
thrown
together
with
common
stone
to
make
walls
between
the
fields
the
village
is
built
on
both
sides
of
the
rhyndacus
it
is
an
ordinary
turkish
hamlet
with
tiled
roofs
and
chimneys
and
exhibits
very
few
of
the
remains
of
the
old
city
in
its
composition
this
i
suspect
is
owing
to
the
great
size
of
the
hewn
blocks
especially
of
the
pillars
cornices
and
entablatures
nearly
all
of
which
are
from
twelve
to
fifteen
feet
long
it
is
from
the
size
and
number
of
these
scattered
blocks
rather
than
from
the
buildings
which
still
partially
exist
that
one
obtains
an
idea
of
the
size
and
splendor
of
the
ancient
oezani
the
place
is
filled
with
fragments
especially
of
columns
of
which
there
are
several
hundred
nearly
all
finely
fluted
the
rhyndacus
is
still
spanned
by
an
ancient
bridge
of
three
arches
and
both
banks
are
lined
with
piers
of
hewn
stone
tall
poplars
and
massy
walnuts
of
the
richest
green
shade
the
clear
waters
and
there
are
many
picturesque
combinations
of
foliage
and
ruin
death
and
life
which
would
charm
a
painter
eye
near
the
bridge
we
stopped
to
examine
a
pile
of
immense
fragments
which
have
been
thrown
together
by
the
turks
pillars
cornices
altars
pieces
of
a
frieze
with
bulls
heads
bound
together
by
hanging
garlands
and
a
large
square
block
with
a
legible
tablet
it
resembled
an
altar
in
form
and
from
the
word
appeared
to
have
belonged
to
some
temple
to
diana
passing
through
the
village
we
came
to
a
grand
artificial
platform
on
its
western
side
called
the
acropolis
it
is
of
solid
masonry
five
hundred
feet
square
and
averaging
ten
feet
in
height
on
the
eastern
side
it
is
supported
on
rude
though
massive
arches
resembling
etruscan
workmanship
on
the
top
and
around
the
edges
of
this
platform
lie
great
numbers
of
fluted
columns
and
immense
fragments
of
cornice
and
architrave
in
the
centre
on
a
foundation
platform
about
eight
feet
high
stands
a
beautiful
ionic
temple
one
hundred
feet
in
length
on
approaching
it
appeared
nearly
perfect
except
the
roof
and
so
many
of
the
columns
remain
standing
that
its
ruined
condition
scarcely
injures
the
effect
there
are
seventeen
columns
on
the
side
and
eight
at
the
end
ionic
in
style
fluted
and
fifty
feet
in
height
about
half
the
cella
remains
with
an
elegant
frieze
and
cornice
along
the
top
and
a
series
of
tablets
set
in
panels
of
ornamental
sculpture
running
along
the
sides
the
front
of
the
cella
includes
a
small
open
peristyle
with
two
composite
corinthian
columns
at
the
entrance
making
with
those
of
the
outer
colonnade
eighteen
columns
standing
the
tablets
contain
greek
inscriptions
perfectly
legible
where
the
stone
has
not
been
shattered
under
the
temple
there
are
large
vaults
which
we
found
filled
up
with
young
kids
who
had
gone
in
there
to
escape
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
portico
was
occupied
by
sheep
which
at
first
refused
to
make
room
for
us
and
gave
strong
olfactory
evidence
of
their
partiality
for
the
temple
as
a
on
the
side
of
a
hill
about
three
hundred
yards
to
the
north
are
the
remains
of
a
theatre
crossing
some
patches
of
barley
and
lentils
we
entered
a
stadium
forming
an
extension
of
the
theatre
is
it
took
the
same
breadth
and
direction
so
that
the
two
might
be
considered
as
one
grand
work
more
than
one
thousand
feet
long
by
nearly
four
hundred
wide
the
walls
of
the
stadium
are
hurled
down
except
an
entrance
of
five
arches
of
massive
masonry
on
the
western
side
we
rode
up
the
artificial
valley
between
high
grassy
hills
completely
covered
with
what
at
a
distance
resembled
loose
boards
but
which
were
actually
the
long
marble
seats
of
the
stadium
urging
our
horses
over
piles
of
loose
blocks
we
reached
the
base
of
the
theatre
climbed
the
fragments
that
cumber
the
main
entrance
and
looked
on
the
spacious
arena
and
galleries
within
although
greatly
ruined
the
materials
of
the
whole
structure
remain
and
might
be
put
together
again
it
is
a
grand
wreck
the
colossal
fragments
which
have
tumbled
from
the
arched
proscenium
fill
the
arena
and
the
rows
of
seats
though
broken
and
disjointed
still
retain
their
original
order
it
is
somewhat
more
than
a
semicircle
the
radius
being
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
the
original
height
was
upwards
of
fifty
feet
and
there
were
fifty
rows
of
seats
in
all
each
row
capable
of
seating
two
hundred
persons
so
that
the
number
of
spectators
who
could
be
accommodated
was
eight
thousand
the
fragments
cumbering
the
arena
were
enormous
and
highly
interesting
from
their
character
there
were
rich
blocks
of
cornice
ten
feet
long
fluted
and
reeded
pillars
great
arcs
of
sculpture
which
appeared
to
have
served
as
architraves
from
pillar
to
pillar
along
the
face
of
the
proscenium
where
there
was
every
trace
of
having
been
a
colonnade
and
other
blocks
sculptured
with
figures
of
animals
in
there
were
generally
two
figures
on
each
block
and
among
those
which
could
be
recognized
were
the
dog
and
the
lion
doors
opened
from
the
proscenium
into
the
of
the
actors
under
which
were
the
vaults
where
the
beasts
were
kept
a
young
fox
or
jackal
started
from
his
siesta
as
we
entered
the
theatre
and
took
refuge
under
the
loose
blocks
looking
backwards
through
the
stadium
from
the
seats
of
the
theatre
we
had
a
lovely
view
of
the
temple
standing
out
clear
and
bright
in
the
midst
of
the
summer
plain
with
the
summits
of
murad
dagh
in
the
distance
it
was
a
picture
which
i
shall
long
remember
the
desolation
of
the
magnificent
ruins
was
made
all
the
more
impressive
by
the
silent
solitary
air
of
the
region
around
them
leaving
chavdür
in
the
afternoon
we
struck
northward
down
the
valley
of
the
rhyndacus
over
tracts
of
rolling
land
interspersed
with
groves
of
cedar
and
pine
there
were
so
many
branch
roads
and
crossings
that
we
could
not
fail
to
go
wrong
and
after
two
or
three
hours
found
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
on
the
broad
top
of
a
mountain
without
any
road
at
all
there
were
some
herdsmen
tending
their
flocks
near
at
hand
but
they
could
give
us
no
satisfactory
direction
we
thereupon
took
our
own
course
and
soon
brought
up
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
overhanging
a
deep
valley
away
to
the
eastward
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
rhyndacus
and
the
wooden
minaret
of
a
little
village
on
his
banks
following
the
edge
of
the
precipice
we
came
at
last
to
a
glen
down
which
ran
a
rough
footpath
that
finally
conducted
us
by
a
long
road
through
the
forests
to
the
village
of
daghje
köi
where
we
are
now
encamped
the
place
seems
to
be
devoted
to
the
making
of
flints
and
the
streets
are
filled
with
piles
of
the
chipped
fragments
our
tent
is
pitched
on
the
bank
of
the
river
in
a
barren
meadow
the
people
tell
us
that
the
whole
region
round
about
has
just
been
visited
by
a
plague
of
grasshoppers
which
have
destroyed
their
crops
our
beasts
have
wandered
off
to
the
hills
in
search
for
grass
and
the
disconsolate
hadji
is
hunting
them
achmet
the
katurgee
lies
near
the
fire
sick
harrison
complains
of
fever
and
françois
moves
about
languidly
with
a
dismal
countenance
so
here
we
are
in
the
solitudes
of
bithynia
but
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
that
which
is
destined
comes
to
pass

looked

farther

higher
and
saw
in
the
heavens
a
silvery
cloud
that
stood
fast
and
still
against
the
breeze
and
so
it
was
as
a
sign
and
a
testimony
almost
as
a
call
from
the
neglected
gods
that
i
now
saw
and
acknowledged

from

there
were
two
roads
to

but
the
people
informed
us
that
the
one
which
led
across
the
mountains
was
difficult
to
find
and
almost
impracticable
we
therefore
took
the
river
road
which
we
found
picturesque
in
the
highest
degree
the
narrow
dell
of
the
rhyndacus
wound
through
a
labyrinth
of
mountains
sometimes
turning
at
sharp
angles
between
craggy
buttresses
covered
with
forests
and
sometimes
broadening
out
into
a
sweep
of
valley
where
the
villagers
were
working
in
companies
among
the
grain
and
poppy
fields
the
banks
of
the
stream
were
lined
with
oak
willow
and
sycamore
and
forests
of
pine
descending
from
the
mountains
frequently
overhung
the
road
we
met
numbers
of
peasants
going
to
and
from
the
fields
and
once
a
company
of
some
twenty
women
who
on
seeing
us
clustered
together
like
a
flock
of
frightened
sheep
and
threw
their
mantles
over
their
heads
they
had
curiosity
enough
however
to
peep
at
us
as
we
went
by
and
i
made
them
a
salutation
which
they
returned
and
then
burst
into
a
chorus
of
hearty
laughter
all
this
region
was
ravaged
by
a
plague
of
grasshoppers
the
earth
was
black
with
them
in
many
places
and
our
horses
ploughed
up
a
living
spray
as
they
drove
forward
through
the
meadows
every
spear
of
grass
was
destroyed
and
the
wheat
and
rye
fields
were
terribly
cut
up
we
passed
a
large
crag
where
myriads
of
starlings
had
built
their
nests
and
every
starling
had
a
grasshopper
in
his
mouth
we
crossed
the
river
in
order
to
pass
a
narrow
defile
by
which
it
forces
its
way
through
the
rocky
heights
of
dumanidj
dagh
soon
after
passing
the
ridge
a
broad
and
beautiful
valley
expanded
before
us
it
was
about
ten
miles
in
breadth
nearly
level
and
surrounded
by
picturesque
ranges
of
wooded
mountains
it
was
well
cultivated
principally
in
rye
and
poppies
and
more
thickly
populated
than
almost
any
part
of
europe
the
tinned
tops
of
the
minarets
of
taushanlü
shone
over
the
top
of
a
hill
in
front
and
there
was
a
large
town
nearly
opposite
on
the
other
bank
of
the
rhyndacus
and
seven
small
villages
scattered
about
in
various
directions
most
of
the
latter
however
were
merely
the
winter
habitations
of
the
herdsmen
who
are
now
living
in
tents
on
the
mountain
tops
all
over
the
valley
the
peasants
were
at
work
in
the
cutting
and
binding
grain
gathering
opium
from
the
poppies
or
weeding
the
young
tobacco
in
the
south
over
the
rim
of
the
hills
that
shut
in
this
pastoral
solitude
rose
the
long
blue
summits
of
urus
dagh
we
rode
into
taushanlü
which
is
a
long
town
filling
up
a
hollow
between
two
stony
hills
the
houses
are
all
of
stone
two
stories
high
with
tiled
roofs
and
chimneys
so
that
but
for
the
clapboarded
and
shingled
minarets
it
would
answer
for
a
village
the
streets
were
nearly
deserted
and
even
in
the
bazaars
which
are
of
some
extent
we
found
but
few
persons
those
few
however
showed
a
laudable
curiosity
with
regard
to
us
clustering
about
us
whenever
we
stopped
and
staring
at
us
with
provoking
pertinacity
we
had
some
difficulty
in
procuring
information
concerning
the
road
the
directions
being
so
contradictory
that
we
were
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
we
lost
half
an
hour
in
wandering
among
the
hills
and
after
travelling
four
hours
over
piny
uplands
without
finding
the
village
of
kara
köi
encamped
on
a
dry
plain
on
the
western
bank
of
the
river
there
was
not
a
spear
of
grass
for
the
beasts
everything
being
eaten
up
by
the
grasshoppers
and
there
were
no
turcomans
near
who
could
supply
us
with
food
so
we
dined
on
hard
bread
and
black
coffee
and
our
forlorn
beasts
walked
languidly
about
cropping
the
dry
stalks
of
weeds
and
the
juiceless
roots
of
the
dead
grass
we
crossed
the
river
next
morning
and
took
a
road
following
its
course
and
shaded
with
willows
and
sycamores
the
lofty
wooded
ranges
of
the
mysian
olympus
lay
before
us
and
our
day
work
was
to
pass
them
after
passing
the
village
of
kara
köi
we
left
the
valley
of
the
rhyndacus
and
commenced
ascending
one
of
the
long
projecting
spurs
thrust
out
from
the
main
chain
of
olympus
at
first
we
rode
through
thickets
of
scrubby
cedar
but
soon
came
to
magnificent
pine
forests
that
grew
taller
and
sturdier
the
higher
we
clomb
a
superb
mountain
landscape
opened
behind
us
the
valleys
sank
deeper
and
deeper
and
at
last
disappeared
behind
the
great
ridges
that
heaved
themselves
out
of
the
wilderness
of
smaller
hills
all
these
ridges
were
covered
with
forests
and
as
we
looked
backwards
out
of
the
tremendous
gulf
up
the
sides
of
which
we
were
climbing
the
scenery
was
wholly
wild
and
uncultivated
our
path
hung
on
the
imminent
side
of
a
chasm
so
steep
that
one
slip
might
have
been
destruction
to
both
horse
and
rider
far
below
us
at
the
bottom
of
the
chasm
roared
an
invisible
torrent
the
opposite
side
vapory
from
its
depth
rose
like
an
immense
wall
against
heaven
the
pines
were
even
grander
than
those
in
the
woods
of
phrygia
here
they
grew
taller
and
more
dense
hanging
their
cloudy
boughs
over
the
giddy
depths
and
clutching
with
desperate
roots
to
the
almost
perpendicular
sides
of
the
gorges
in
many
places
they
were
the
primeval
forests
of
olympus
and
the
hamadryads
were
not
yet
frightened
from
their
haunts
thus
slowly
toiling
up
through
the
sublime
wilderness
breathing
the
cold
pure
air
of
those
lofty
regions
we
came
at
last
to
a
little
stream
slowly
trickling
down
the
bed
of
the
gorge
it
was
shaded
not
by
the
pine
but
by
the
northern
beech
with
its
white
trunk
and
close
confidential
boughs
made
for
the
talks
of
lovers
and
the
meditations
of
poets
here
we
stopped
to
breakfast
but
there
was
nothing
for
the
poor
beasts
to
eat
and
they
waited
for
us
droopingly
with
their
heads
thrust
together
while
we
sat
there
three
camels
descended
to
the
stream
and
after
them
a
guard
with
a
long
gun
he
was
a
man
with
a
brown
face
keen
black
eye
and
piratical
air
and
would
have
made
a
good
hero
of
modern
romance
higher
up
we
came
to
a
guard
house
on
a
little
cleared
space
surrounded
by
beech
forests
it
was
a
rough
stone
hut
with
a
white
flag
planted
on
a
pole
before
it
and
a
miniature
running
a
miniature
saw
at
a
most
destructive
rate
beside
the
door
continuing
our
way
we
entered
on
a
region
such
as
i
had
no
idea
could
be
found
in
asia
the
mountains
from
the
bottoms
of
the
gorges
to
their
topmost
summits
were
covered
with
the
most
superb
forests
of
beech
i
ever
saw
masses
of
impenetrable
foliage
of
the
most
brilliant
green
touched
here
and
there
by
the
darker
top
of
a
pine
our
road
was
through
a
deep
dark
shade
and
on
either
side
up
and
down
we
saw
but
a
cool
shadowy
solitude
sprinkled
with
dots
of
emerald
light
and
redolent
with
the
odor
of
damp
earth
moss
and
dead
leaves
it
was
a
forest
the
counterpart
of
which
could
only
be
found
in
america
such
primeval
magnitude
of
growth
such
wild
luxuriance
such
complete
solitude
and
silence
through
the
shafts
of
the
pines
we
had
caught
glorious
glimpses
of
the
blue
mountain
world
below
us
but
now
the
beech
folded
us
in
its
arms
and
whispered
in
our
ears
the
legends
of
our
northern
home
there
on
the
ridges
of
the
mysian
olympus
sacred
to
the
bright
gods
of
grecian
song
i
found
the
inspiration
of
our
darker
and
colder
clime
and
age
gloriosi
spiriti
degli
boschi
i
could
scarcely
contain
myself
from
surprise
and
joy
françois
failed
to
find
french
adjectives
sufficient
for
his
admiration
and
even
our
cheating
katurgees
were
touched
by
the
spirit
of
the
scene
on
either
side
whenever
a
glimpse
could
be
had
through
the
boughs
we
looked
upon
leaning
walls
of
trees
whose
tall
rounded
tops
basked
in
the
sunshine
while
their
bases
were
wrapped
in
the
shadows
cast
by
themselves
thus
folded
over
each
other
like
scales
or
feathers
on
a
falcon
wing
they
clad
the
mountain
the
trees
were
taller
and
had
a
darker
and
more
glossy
leaf
than
the
american
beech
by
and
by
patches
of
blue
shone
between
the
boughs
before
us
a
sign
that
the
summit
was
near
and
before
one
we
stood
upon
the
narrow
ridge
forming
the
crest
of
the
mountain
here
although
we
were
between
five
and
six
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
the
woods
of
beech
were
a
hundred
feet
in
height
and
shut
out
all
view
on
the
northern
side
the
forest
scenery
is
even
grander
than
on
the
southern
the
beeches
are
magnificent
trees
straight
as
an
arrow
and
from
a
hundred
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
only
now
and
then
could
we
get
any
view
beyond
the
shadowy
depths
sinking
below
us
and
then
it
was
only
to
see
similar
mountain
ranges
buried
in
foliage
and
rolling
far
behind
each
other
into
the
distance
twice
in
the
depth
of
the
gorge
we
saw
a
turned
by
the
torrents
piles
of
pine
and
beechen
boards
were
heaped
around
them
and
the
sawyers
were
busily
plying
their
lonely
business
the
axe
of
the
woodman
echoed
but
rarely
through
the
gulfs
though
many
large
trees
lay
felled
by
the
roadside
the
rock
which
occasionally
cropped
out
of
the
soil
was
white
marble
and
there
was
a
shining
precipice
of
it
three
hundred
feet
high
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
gorge
after
four
hours
of
steady
descent
during
the
last
hour
of
which
we
passed
into
a
forest
entirely
of
oaks
we
reached
the
first
terrace
at
the
base
of
the
mountain
here
as
i
was
riding
in
advance
of
the
caravan
i
met
a
company
of
turkish
officers
who
saluted
me
with
an
inclination
of
the
most
profound
reverence
i
replied
with
due
oriental
gravity
which
seemed
to
justify
their
respect
for
when
they
met
françois
who
is
everywhere
looked
upon
as
a
turkish
janissary
they
asked
is
not
your
master
a
you
are
right
he
is
answered
the
unscrupulous
greek
a
shekh
is
a
sort
of
corresponding
in
dignity
to
a
cardinal
in
the
roman
catholic
church
it
is
rather
singular
that
i
am
generally
taken
for
a
secretary
of
some
kind
or
a
moslem
priest
while
my
companion
who
by
this
time
has
assumed
the
oriental
expression
is
supposed
to
be
either
medical
or
military
we
had
no
sooner
left
the
forests
and
entered
the
copsewood
which
followed
than
the
blue
bulk
of
olympus
suddenly
appeared
in
the
west
towering
far
into
the
sky
it
is
a
magnificent
mountain
with
a
broad
though
broken
summit
streaked
with
snow
before
us
stretching
away
almost
to
his
base
lay
a
grand
mountain
slope
covered
with
orchards
and
golden
through
lanes
of
hawthorn
and
chestnut
trees
in
blossom
which
were
overgrown
with
snowy
clematis
and
made
a
shady
roof
above
our
heads
we
reached
the
little
village
of
orta
köi
and
encamped
in
a
grove
of
there
was
grass
for
our
beasts
who
were
on
the
brink
of
starvation
and
fowls
and
cucumbers
for
ourselves
who
had
been
limited
to
bread
and
coffee
for
two
days
but
as
one
necessity
was
restored
another
disappeared
we
had
smoked
the
last
of
our
delicious
aleppo
tobacco
and
that
which
the
villagers
gave
us
was
of
very
inferior
quality
nevertheless
the
pipe
which
we
smoked
with
them
in
the
twilight
beside
the
marble
fountain
promoted
that
peace
of
mind
which
is
the
sweetest
preparative
of
slumber
françois
was
determined
to
finish
our
journey
he
had
a
presentiment
that
we
should
reach
brousa
although
i
expected
nothing
of
the
kind
he
called
us
long
before
the
lovely
pastoral
valley
in
which
we
lay
had
a
suspicion
of
the
sun
but
just
in
time
to
see
the
first
rays
strike
the
high
head
of
olympus
the
long
lines
of
snow
blushed
with
an
opaline
radiance
against
the
of
the
morning
sky
and
all
the
forests
and
fields
below
lay
still
and
cool
and
dewy
lapped
in
dreams
yet
unrecalled
by
the
fading
moon
i
bathed
my
face
in
the
cold
well
that
perpetually
poured
over
its
full
brim
drank
the
coffee
which
françois
had
already
prepared
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
began
the
last
day
of
our
long
pilgrimage
the
tent
was
folded
alas
for
the
last
time
and
now
farewell
to
the
freedom
of
our
wandering
life
shall
i
ever
feel
it
again
the
dew
glistened
on
the
chestnuts
and
the
walnuts
on
the
wild
and
wild
roses
that
shaded
our
road
as
we
followed
the
course
of
an
olympian
stream
through
a
charming
dell
into
the
great
plain
below
everywhere
the
same
bountiful
soil
the
same
superb
orchards
the
same
ripe
fields
of
wheat
and
barley
and
silver
rye
the
peasants
were
at
work
men
and
women
cutting
the
grain
with
rude
scythes
binding
it
into
sheaves
and
stacking
it
in
the
fields
as
we
rode
over
the
plain
the
boys
came
running
out
to
us
with
handfuls
of
grain
saluting
us
from
afar
bidding
us
welcome
as
pilgrims
wishing
us
as
many
years
of
prosperity
as
there
were
kernels
in
their
sheaves
and
kissing
the
hands
that
gave
them
the
the
whole
landscape
had
an
air
of
plenty
peace
and
contentment
the
people
all
greeted
us
cordially
and
once
a
mevlevi
dervish
and
a
stately
turk
riding
in
company
saluted
me
so
respectfully
stopping
to
speak
with
me
that
i
quite
regretted
being
obliged
to
assume
an
air
of
dignified
reserve
and
ride
away
from
them
ere
long
we
saw
the
two
white
minarets
of
aineghiöl
above
the
line
of
orchards
in
front
of
us
and
in
three
hours
after
starting
reached
the
place
it
is
a
small
town
not
particularly
clean
but
with
bazaars
in
one
of
the
houses
i
saw
pairs
of
superb
antlers
the
spoils
of
olympian
stags
the
bazaar
is
covered
with
a
trellised
roof
overgrown
with
which
hang
enormous
bunches
of
young
grapes
over
the
we
were
cheered
by
the
news
that
brousa
was
only
eight
hours
distant
and
i
now
began
to
hope
that
we
might
reach
it
we
jogged
on
as
fast
as
we
could
urge
our
weary
horses
passed
another
belt
of
orchard
land
paid
more
to
the
reapers
and
commenced
ascending
a
chain
of
low
hills
which
divides
the
plain
of
aineghiöl
from
that
of
brousa
at
a
fountain
called
the
we
met
some
travellers
coming
from
brousa
who
informed
us
that
we
could
get
there
by
the
time
of
prayer
rounding
the
base
of
olympus
we
now
saw
before
us
the
long
headland
which
forms
his
extremity
a
storm
was
arising
from
the
sea
of
marmora
and
heavy
white
clouds
settled
on
the
topmost
summits
of
the
mountain
the
wind
began
to
blow
fresh
and
cool
and
when
we
had
reached
a
height
overlooking
the
deep
valley
in
the
bottom
of
which
lies
the
picturesque
village
of
there
were
long
showery
lines
coming
up
from
the
sea
and
a
filmy
sheet
of
gray
rain
descended
between
us
and
olympus
throwing
his
vast
bulk
far
into
the
background
at
the
first
shower
met
us
pouring
so
fast
and
thick
that
we
were
obliged
to
put
on
our
capotes
and
halt
under
a
for
shelter
but
it
soon
passed
over
laying
the
dust
for
the
time
and
making
the
air
sweet
and
cool
we
pushed
forward
over
heights
covered
with
young
forests
of
oak
which
are
protected
by
the
government
in
order
that
they
may
furnish
on
the
right
we
looked
down
into
magnificent
valleys
opening
towards
the
west
into
the
the
plain
of
brousa
but
when
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
reached
the
last
height
and
saw
the
great
plain
itself
the
climax
was
attained
it
was
the
crown
of
all
that
we
had
yet
seen
this
superb
plain
or
valley
thirty
miles
long
by
five
in
breadth
spread
away
to
the
westward
between
the
mighty
mass
of
olympus
on
the
one
side
and
a
range
of
lofty
mountains
on
the
other
the
sides
of
which
presented
a
charming
mixture
of
forest
and
cultivated
land
olympus
covered
with
woods
of
beech
and
oak
towered
to
the
clouds
that
concealed
his
snowy
head
and
far
in
advance
under
the
last
cape
he
threw
out
towards
the
sea
the
hundred
minarets
of
brousa
stretched
in
a
white
and
glittering
line
like
the
masts
of
a
navy
whose
hulls
were
buried
in
the
leafy
sea
no
words
can
describe
the
beauty
of
the
valley
the
blending
of
the
richest
cultivation
with
the
wildest
natural
luxuriance
here
were
gardens
and
orchards
there
groves
of
superb
in
blossom
here
fields
of
golden
grain
or
green
there
arcadian
thickets
overgrown
with
clematis
and
wild
rose
here
lofty
poplars
growing
beside
the
streams
there
spiry
cypresses
looking
down
from
the
slopes
and
all
blended
in
one
whole
so
rich
so
grand
so
gorgeous
that
i
scarcely
breathed
when
it
first
burst
upon
me
and
now
we
descended
to
its
level
and
rode
westward
along
the
base
of
olympus
grandest
of
asian
mountains
this
view
although
his
head
was
shrouded
was
sublime
his
base
is
a
vast
sloping
terrace
leagues
in
length
resembling
the
nights
of
steps
by
which
the
ancient
temples
were
approached
from
this
foundation
rise
four
mighty
pyramids
two
thousand
feet
in
height
and
completely
mantled
with
forests
they
are
very
nearly
regular
in
their
form
and
size
and
are
flanked
to
the
east
and
west
by
headlands
or
abutments
the
slopes
of
which
are
longer
and
more
gradual
as
if
to
strengthen
the
great
structure
piled
upon
the
four
pyramids
are
others
nearly
as
large
above
whose
green
pinnacles
appear
still
other
and
higher
ones
bare
and
bleak
and
clustering
thickly
together
to
uphold
the
great
central
dome
of
snow
between
the
bases
of
the
lowest
the
streams
which
drain
the
gorges
of
the
mountain
issue
forth
cutting
their
way
through
the
foundation
terrace
and
widening
their
beds
downwards
to
the
plain
like
the
throats
of
bugles
where
in
winter
rains
they
pour
forth
the
hoarse
grand
monotone
of
their
olympian
music
these
broad
beds
are
now
dry
and
stony
tracts
dotted
all
over
with
clumps
of
dwarfed
sycamores
and
threaded
by
the
summer
streams
shrunken
in
bulk
but
still
swift
cold
and
clear
as
ever
we
reached
the
city
before
night
and
françois
is
glad
to
find
his
presentiment
fulfilled
we
have
safely
passed
through
the
untravelled
heart
of
asia
minor
and
are
now
almost
in
sight
of

the

the

is

we
are
no
longer
happy
nomads
masquerading
in
moslem
garb
we
shall
soon
become
prosaic
christians
and
meekly
hold
out
our
wrists
for
the

civilization
ah
prate
as
we
will
of
the
progress
of
the
race
we
are
but
forging
additional
fetters
unless
we
preserve
that
healthy
physical
development
those
pure
pleasures
of
mere
animal
existence
which
are
now
only
to
be
found
among
our
brethren
our
progress
is
nervous
when
it

not

from
its
celebrated
hot
baths
it
is
a
new
building
in

style
and
being
built
high
on
the
slope
commands
one
of
the
most
glorious
prospects
i
ever
enjoyed
from
windows
made
with
hands
what
a
comfort
it
was
to
go
up
stairs
into
a
clean
bright
cheerful
room
to
drop
at
full
length
on
a
broad
divan
to
eat
a
christian
meal
to
smoke
a
narghileh
of
the
softest
persian

and
finally
most
exquisite
of
all
luxuries
to
creep
between
cool
clean
sheets
on
a
curtained
bed
and
find
it
impossible
to
sleep
on
account
of
the
delicious
novelty
of
the
sensation
at
night
another
storm
came
up
from
the
sea
of
marmora
tremendous
peals
of
thunder
echoed
in
the
gorges
of
olympus
and
sharp
broad
flashes
of
lightning
gave
us
blinding
glimpses
of
the
glorious
plain
below
the
rain
fell
in
heavy
showers
but
our
was
just
closed
and
we
sat
securely
at
our
windows
and
enjoyed
the
sublime
scene
the
sun
rising
over
the
distant
mountains
of
isnik
shone
full
in
my
face
awaking
me
to
a
morning
view
of
the
valley
which
freshened
by
the
night
shone
wonderfully
bright
and
clear
after
coffee
we
went
to
see
the
baths
which
are
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
a
mile
from
the
hotel
the
finest
one
called
the
kalputcha
hammam
is
at
the
base
of
the
hill
the
entrance
hall
is
very
large
and
covered
by
two
lofty
domes
in
the
centre
is
a
large
marble
fountain
pouring
out
an
abundant
flood
of
cold
water
out
of
this
we
passed
into
an
immense
rotunda
filled
with
steam
and
traversed
by
long
pencils
of
light
falling
from
holes
in
the
roof
a
small
but
very
beautiful
marble
fountain
cast
up
a
jet
of
cold
water
in
the
centre
beyond
this
was
still
another
hall
of
the
same
size
but
with
a
circular
basin
feet
in
diameter
in
the
centre
the
floor
was
marble
mosaic
and
the
basin
was
lined
with
tiles
it
was
kept
constantly
full
by
the
natural
hot
streams
of
the
mountain
there
were
a
number
of
persons
in
the
pool
but
the
atmosphere
was
so
hot
that
we
did
not
long
disturb
them
by
our
curiosity
we
then
ascended
to
the
armenian
bath
which
is
the
neatest
of
all
but
it
was
given
up
to
the
women
and
we
were
therefore
obliged
to
go
to
a
turkish
one
adjoining
the
room
into
which
we
were
taken
was
so
hot
that
a
violent
perspiration
immediately
broke
out
all
over
my
body
and
by
the
time
the
were
ready
to
rasp
me
i
was
as
limp
as
a
wet
towel
and
as
plastic
as
a
piece
of
putty
the
man
who
took
me
was
sweated
away
almost
to
nothing
his
very
bones
appeared
to
have
become
soft
and
pliable
the
water
was
slightly
sulphureous
and
the
pailfuls
which
he
dashed
over
my
head
were
so
hot
that
they
produced
the
effect
of
a
chill
a
violent
nervous
shudder
the
temperature
of
the
springs
is
fahrenheit
and
i
suppose
the
tank
into
which
he
afterwards
plunged
me
must
have
been
nearly
up
to
the
mark
when
at
last
i
was
laid
on
the
couch
my
body
was
so
parboiled
that
i
perspired
at
all
pores
for
full
an
hour
a
feeling
too
warm
and
unpleasant
at
first
but
presently
merging
into
a
mood
which
was
wholly
rapturous
and
heavenly
i
was
like
a
soft
white
cloud
that
rests
all
of
a
summer
afternoon
on
the
peak
of
a
distant
mountain
i
felt
the
couch
on
which
i
lay
no
more
than
the
cloud
might
feel
the
cliffs
on
which
it
lingers
so
airily
i
saw
nothing
but
peaceful
glorious
sights
spaces
of
clear
blue
sky
stretches
of
quiet
lawns
lovely
valleys
threaded
by
the
gentlest
of
streams
azure
lakes
unruffled
by
a
breath
calms
far
out
on
and
alpine
peaks
bathed
in
the
flush
of
an
autumnal
sunset
my
mind
retraced
all
our
journey
from
aleppo
and
there
was
a
halo
over
every
spot
i
had
visited
i
dwelt
with
rapture
on
the
piny
hills
of
phrygia
on
the
gorges
of
taurus
on
the
beechen
solitudes
of
olympus
would
to
heaven
that
i
might
describe
those
scenes
as
i
then
felt
them
all
was
revealed
to
me
the
heart
of
nature
lay
bare
and
i
read
the
meaning
and
knew
the
inspiration
of
her
every
mood
then
as
my
frame
grew
cooler
and
the
fragrant
clouds
of
the
narghileh
which
had
helped
my
dreams
diminished
i
was
like
that
same
summer
cloud
when
it
feels
a
gentle
breeze
and
is
lifted
above
the
hills
floating
along
independent
of
earth
but
for
its
shadow
brousa
is
a
very
long
straggling
place
extending
for
three
or
four
miles
along
the
side
of
the
mountain
but
presenting
a
very
picturesque
appearance
from
every
point
the
houses
are
nearly
all
three
stories
high
built
of
wood
and
unburnt
bricks
and
each
story
projects
over
the
other
after
the
manner
of
german
towns
of
the
middle
ages
they
have
not
the
hanging
balconies
which
i
have
found
so
quaint
and
pleasing
in
kiutahya
but
especially
in
the
greek
quarter
many
of
them
are
plastered
and
painted
of
some
bright
color
which
gives
a
gay
cheerful
appearance
to
the
streets
besides
brousa
is
the
cleanest
turkish
town
i
have
seen
the
mountain
streams
traverse
most
of
the
streets
and
every
heavy
rain
washes
them
out
thoroughly
the
whole
city
has
a
brisk
active
air
and
the
workmen
appear
both
more
skilful
and
more
industrious
than
in
the
other
parts
of
asia
minor
i
noticed
a
great
many
workers
in
copper
iron
and
wood
and
an
extensive
manufactory
of
shoes
and
saddles
brousa
however
is
principally
noted
for
its
silks
which
are
produced
in
this
valley
and
others
to
the
south
and
east
the
manufactories
are
near
the
city
i
looked
over
some
of
the
fabrics
in
the
bazaars
but
found
them
nearly
all
imitations
of
european
stuffs
woven
in
mixed
silk
and
cotton
and
even
more
costly
than
the
silks
of
damascus
we
passed
the
whole
length
of
the
bazaars
and
then
turning
up
one
of
the
side
streets
on
our
right
crossed
a
deep
ravine
by
a
high
stone
bridge
above
and
below
us
there
were
other
bridges
under
which
a
stream
flowed
down
from
the
mountains
thence
we
ascended
the
height
whereon
stands
the
largest
and
one
of
the
oldest
mosques
in
brousa
the
position
is
remarkably
fine
commanding
a
view
of
nearly
the
whole
city
and
the
plain
below
it
we
entered
the
boldly
françois
taking
the
precaution
to
speak
to
me
only
in
arabic
as
there
was
a
turk
within
went
to
the
fountain
washed
his
hands
and
face
but
did
not
dare
to
swallow
a
drop
putting
on
a
most
dolorous
expression
of
countenance
as
if
perishing
with
thirst
the
mosque
was
a
plain
square
building
with
a
large
dome
and
two
minarets
the
door
was
a
rich
and
curious
specimen
of
the
style
so
frequent
in
saracenic
buildings
we
peeped
into
the
windows
and
although
the
mosque
which
does
not
appear
to
be
in
common
use
was
darkened
saw
enough
to
show
that
the
interior
was
quite
plain
just
above
this
edifice
stands
a
large
octagonal
tomb
surmounted
by
a
dome
and
richly
adorned
with
arabesque
cornices
and
coatings
of
green
and
blue
tiles
it
stood
in
a
small
garden
inclosure
and
there
was
a
sort
of
porter
lodge
at
the
entrance
as
we
approached
an
old
man
in
a
green
turban
came
out
and
on
françois
requesting
entrance
for
us
took
a
key
and
conducted
us
to
the
building
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
our
being
christians
we
took
off
our
slippers
before
touching
the
lintel
of
the
door
as
the
place
was
particularly
holy
then
throwing
open
the
door
the
old
man
lingered
a
few
moments
after
we
entered
so
as
not
to
disturb
our
prayers
a
mark
of
great
respect
we
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
parapet
turned
our
faces
towards
mecca
and
imitated
the
usual
mohammedan
prayer
on
entering
a
mosque
by
holding
both
arms
outspread
for
a
few
moments
then
bringing
the
hands
together
and
bowing
the
face
upon
them
this
done
we
leisurely
examined
the
building
and
the
old
man
was
ready
enough
to
satisfy
our
curiosity
it
was
a
rich
and
elegant
structure
lighted
from
the
dome
the
walls
were
lined
with
brilliant
tiles
and
had
an
elaborate
cornice
with
arabic
inscriptions
in
gold
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
carpet
whereon
stood
eight
or
ten
ancient
coffins
surrounding
a
larger
one
which
occupied
a
raised
platform
in
the
centre
they
were
all
of
wood
heavily
carved
and
many
of
them
entirely
covered
with
gilded
inscriptions
these
according
to
the
old
man
were
the
coffins
of
the
ottoman
sultans
who
had
reigned
at
brousa
previous
to
the
taking
of
constantinople
with
some
members
of
their
families
there
were
four
sultans
among
whom
were
mahomet
and
a
certain
achmet
orchan
the
founder
of
the
ottoman
dynasty
is
buried
somewhere
in
brousa
and
the
great
central
coffin
may
have
been
his
françois
and
i
talked
entirely
in
arabic
and
the
old
man
asked
who
are
these
hadjis
whereupon
immediately
answered
they
are
effendis
from
baghdad
we
had
intended
making
the
ascent
of
olympus
but
the
summit
was
too
thickly
covered
with
clouds
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
therefore
we
determined
to
take
up
the
line
of
march
for
constantinople
the
last
scene
of
our
strange
eventful
history
with
the
katurgees
had
just
transpired
by
their
deserting
us
being
two
hundred
piastres
in
our
debt
they
left
their
khan
on
the
afternoon
after
our
arrival
ostensibly
for
the
purpose
of
taking
their
beasts
out
to
pasture
and
were
never
heard
of
more
we
let
them
go
thankful
that
they
had
not
played
the
trick
sooner
we
engaged
fresh
horses
for
moudania
on
the
sea
of
marmora
and
dispatched
françois
in
advance
to
procure
a
caïque
for
constantinople
while
we
waited
to
have
our
passports
signed
but
after
waiting
an
hour
as
there
was
no
appearance
of
the
precious
documents
we
started
the
baggage
also
under
the
charge
of
a
and
remained
alone
another
hour
passed
by
and
yet
another
and
the
bey
was
still
occupied
in
sleeping
off
his
hunger
harrison
in
desperation
went
to
the
office
and
after
some
delay
received
the
passports
with
a
visè
but
not
as
we
afterwards
discovered
the
necessary
one
it
was
four
by
the
time
we
left
brousa
our
horses
were
stiff
clumsy
but
by
dint
of
whips
and
the
sharp
we
forced
them
into
a
trot
and
made
them
keep
it
the
road
was
well
travelled
and
by
asking
everybody
we
met
yôl
moudania
is
this
the
way
to
moudania
we
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
it
the
plain
in
many
places
is
marshy
and
traversed
by
several
streams
a
low
range
of
hills
stretches
across
and
nearly
closes
it
the
united
waters
finding
their
outlet
by
a
narrow
valley
to
the
north
from
the
top
of
the
hill
we
had
a
grand
view
looking
back
over
the
plain
with
the
long
line
of
brousa
minarets
glittering
through
the
interminable
groves
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
olympus
now
showed
a
superb
outline
the
clouds
hung
about
his
shoulders
but
his
snowy
head
was
bare
before
us
lay
a
broad
rich
valley
extending
in
front
to
the
mountains
of
moudania
the
country
was
well
cultivated
with
large
farming
establishments
here
and
there
the
sun
was
setting
as
we
reached
the
summit
ridge
where
stood
a
little
as
we
rode
over
the
crest
olympus
disappeared
and
the
sea
of
marmora
lay
before
us
spreading
out
from
the
gulf
of
moudania
which
was
deep
and
blue
among
the
hills
to
an
open
line
against
the
sunset
beyond
that
misty
line
lay
europe
which
i
had
not
seen
for
nearly
nine
months
and
the
gulf
below
me
was
the
bound
of
my
tent
and
saddle
life
but
one
hour
more
old
horse
have
patience
with
my
ethiopian
thong
and
the
sharp
corners
of
my
turkish
stirrups
but
one
hour
more
and
i
promise
never
to
molest
you
again
our
path
was
downward
and
i
marvel
that
the
poor
brute
did
not
sometimes
tumble
headlong
with
me
he
had
been
too
long
used
to
the
pack
however
and
his
habits
were
as
settled
as
a
turk
we
passed
a
beautiful
village
in
a
valley
on
the
right
and
came
into
olive
groves
and
vineyards
as
the
dusk
was
creeping
on
it
was
a
lovely
country
of
orchards
and
gardens
with
fountains
spouting
by
the
wayside
and
country
houses
perched
on
the
steeps
in
another
hour
we
reached
the
it
was
now
nearly
dark
but
we
could
see
the
tower
of
moudania
some
distance
to
the
west
still
in
a
continual
trot
we
rode
on
and
as
we
drew
near
fired
his
gun
to
announce
our
approach
at
the
entrance
of
the
town
we
found
the
sourrudjee
waiting
to
conduct
us
we
clattered
through
the
rough
streets
for
what
seemed
an
endless
length
of
time
the
ramazan
gun
had
just
fired
the
minarets
were
illuminated
and
the
were
filled
with
people
finally
françois
who
had
been
almost
in
despair
at
our
hailed
us
with
the
welcome
news
that
he
had
engaged
a
caïque
and
that
our
baggage
was
already
embarked
we
only
needed
the
visès
of
the
authorities
in
order
to
leave
he
took
our
teskerés
to
get
them
and
we
went
upon
the
balcony
of
a
overhanging
the
sea
and
smoked
a
narghileh
but
here
there
was
another
history
the
teskerés
had
not
been
properly
visèd
at
brousa
and
the
governor
at
first
decided
to
send
us
back
taking
françois
however
for
a
turk
and
finding
that
we
had
regularly
passed
quarantine
he
signed
them
after
a
delay
of
an
hour
and
a
half
and
we
left
the
shore
weary
impatient
and
wolfish
with
twelve
hours
fasting
a
cup
of
brousan
beer
and
a
piece
of
bread
brought
us
into
a
better
mood
and
i
who
began
to
feel
sick
from
the
rolling
of
the
caïque
lay
down
on
my
bed
which
was
spread
at
the
bottom
and
found
a
kind
of
uneasy
sleep
the
sail
was
hoisted
at
first
to
get
us
across
the
mouth
of
the
gulf
but
soon
the
greeks
took
to
their
oars
they
were
silent
however
and
though
i
only
slept
by
fits
the
night
wore
away
rapidly
as
the
dawn
was
deepening
we
ran
into
a
little
bight
in
the
northern
side
of
a
promontory
where
a
picturesque
greek
village
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
the
houses
were
of
wood
with
balconies
overgrown
with
and
there
was
a
fountain
of
cold
excellent
water
on
the
very
beach
some
greek
boatmen
were
smoking
in
the
portico
of
a
café
on
shore
and
two
fishermen
who
had
been
out
before
dawn
to
catch
sardines
were
emptying
their
nets
of
the
spoil
our
men
kindled
a
fire
on
the
sand
and
roasted
us
a
dish
of
the
fish
some
of
the
last
night
hunger
remained
and
the
meal
had
enough
of
that
seasoning
to
be
delicious
after
giving
our
men
an
hour
rest
we
set
off
for
the
princes
islands
which
now
appeared
to
the
north
over
the
glassy
plain
of
the
sea
the
gulf
of
iskmid
or
nicomedia
opened
away
to
the
east
between
two
mountain
headlands
the
morning
was
intensely
hot
and
sultry
and
but
for
the
protection
of
an
umbrella
we
should
have
suffered
greatly
there
was
a
fiery
blue
vapor
on
the
sea
and
a
hid
the
shores
of
thrace
now
and
then
came
a
light
puff
of
wind
whereupon
the
men
would
ship
the
little
mast
and
crowd
on
an
enormous
quantity
of
sail
so
sailing
and
rowing
we
neared
the
islands
with
the
storm
but
it
advanced
slowly
enough
to
allow
a
sight
of
the
mosques
of
sophia
and
sultan
achmed
gleaming
far
and
white
like
icebergs
astray
on
a
torrid
sea
another
cloud
was
pouring
its
rain
over
the
asian
shore
and
we
made
haste
to
get
to
the
landing
at
prinkipo
before
it
could
reach
us
from
the
south
the
group
of
islands
is
not
remarkable
for
beauty
only
four
of
them
prinkipo
chalki
prote
and
antigone
are
inhabited
the
other
five
being
merely
barren
rocks
there
is
an
ancient
convent
on
the
summit
of
prinkipo
where
the
empress
irene
the
contemporary
of
charlemagne
is
buried
the
town
is
on
the
northern
side
of
the
island
and
consists
mostly
of
the
summer
residences
of
greek
and
armenian
merchants
many
of
these
are
large
and
stately
houses
surrounded
with
handsome
gardens
the
streets
are
shaded
with
sycamores
and
the
number
of
shows
that
the
place
is
much
frequented
on
festal
days
a
company
of
drunken
greeks
were
singing
in
violation
of
all
metre
and
harmony
a
discord
the
more
remarkable
since
nothing
could
be
more
affectionate
than
their
conduct
towards
each
other
nearly
everybody
was
in
frank
costume
and
our
oriental
habits
especially
the
red
tartar
boots
attracted
much
observation
i
began
to
feel
awkward
and
absurd
and
longed
to
show
myself
a
christian
once
more
leaving
prinkipo
we
made
for
constantinople
whose
long
array
of
marble
domes
and
gilded
spires
gleamed
like
a
far
mirage
over
the
waveless
sea
it
was
too
faint
and
distant
and
dazzling
to
be
substantial
it
was
like
one
of
those
imaginary
cities
which
we
build
in
a
cloud
fused
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
but
as
we
neared
the
point
of
chalcedon
running
along
the
asian
shore
those
airy
piles
gathered
form
and
substance
the
pinnacles
of
the
seraglio
shot
up
from
the
midst
of
cypress
groves
fantastic
kiosks
lined
the
shore
the
minarets
of
sophia
and
sultan
achmed
rose
more
clearly
against
the
sky
and
a
fleet
of
steamers
and
gay
with
flags
marked
the
entrance
of
the
golden
horn
we
passed
the
little
bay
where
chrysostom
was
buried
the
point
of
chalcedon
and
now
looking
up
the
renowned
bosphorus
saw
the
tower
opposite
scutari
an
enormous
pile
the
barracks
of
the
anatolian
soldiery
hangs
over
the
high
bank
and
as
we
row
abreast
of
it
a
fresh
breeze
comes
up
from
the
sea
of
marmora
the
prow
of
the
caïque
is
turned
across
the
stream
the
sail
is
set
and
we
glide
rapidly
and
noiselessly
over
the
bosphorus
and
into
the
golden
horn
between
the
banks
of
the
frank
and
moslem
pera
and
stamboul
where
on
the
earth
shall
we
find
a
panorama
more
magnificent
the
air
was
filled
with
the
shouts
and
noises
of
the
great
oriental
metropolis
the
water
was
alive
with
caïques
and
little
steamers
and
all
the
world
of
work
and
trade
which
had
grown
almost
to
be
a
fable
welcomed
us
back
to
its
restless
heart
we
threaded
our
rather
perilous
way
over
the
populous
waves
and
landed
in
a
throng
of
officers
and
porters
on
the
wharf
at
galata

constantinople
constantinople
during
the
month
of
ramazan
presents
a
very
different
aspect
from
constantinople
at
other
times
the
city
it
is
true
is
much
more
stern
and
serious
during
the
day
there
is
none
of
that
gay
careless
life
of
the
orient
which
you
see
in
smyrna
cairo
and
damascus
but
when
once
the
sunset
gun
has
fired
and
the
painful
fast
is
at
an
end
the
picture
changes
as
if
by
magic
in
all
the
outward
symbols
of
their
religion
the
mussulmans
show
their
joy
at
being
relieved
from
what
they
consider
a
sacred
duty
during
the
day
it
is
quite
a
science
to
keep
the
appetite
dormant
and
the
people
not
only
abstain
from
eating
and
drinking
but
as
much
as
possible
from
the
sight
of
food
in
the
bazaars
you
see
the
famished
merchants
either
sitting
propped
back
against
their
cushions
with
the
shawl
about
their
stomachs
tightened
so
as
to
prevent
the
void
under
it
from
being
so
sensibly
felt
or
lying
at
full
length
in
the
vain
attempt
to
sleep
it
is
whispered
here
that
many
of
the
turks
will
both
eat
and
smoke
when
there
is
no
chance
of
detection
but
no
one
would
dare
infringe
the
fast
in
public
most
of
the
mechanics
and
porters
are
armenians
and
the
boatmen
are
greeks
i
have
endeavored
to
ascertain
the
origin
of
this
fast
month
the
syrian
christians
say
that
it
is
a
mere
imitation
of
an
incident
which
happened
to
mahomet
the
prophet
having
lost
his
camels
went
day
after
day
seeking
them
in
the
desert
taking
no
nourishment
from
the
time
of
his
departure
in
the
morning
until
his
return
at
sunset
after
having
sought
them
thus
daily
for
the
period
of
one
entire
moon
he
found
them
and
in
token
of
joy
gave
a
three
days
feast
to
the
tribe
now
imitated
in
the
festival
of
bairam
which
lasts
for
three
days
after
the
close
of
ramazan
this
reason
however
seems
too
trifling
for
such
a
rigid
fast
and
the
turkish
tradition
that
the
koran
was
sent
down
from
heaven
during
this
month
offers
a
more
probable
explanation
during
the
fast
the
mussulmans
as
is
quite
natural
are
much
more
fanatical
than
at
other
times
they
are
obliged
to
attend
prayers
at
the
mosque
every
night
or
to
have
a
read
the
koran
to
them
at
their
own
houses
all
the
prominent
features
of
their
religion
are
kept
constantly
before
their
eyes
and
their
natural
aversion
to
the
giaour
or
infidel
is
increased
tenfold
i
have
heard
of
several
recent
instances
in
which
strangers
have
been
exposed
to
insults
and
indignities
at
dusk
the
minarets
are
illuminated
a
peal
of
cannon
from
the
arsenal
echoed
by
others
from
the
forts
along
the
bosphorus
relieves
the
suffering
followers
of
the
prophet
and
after
an
hour
of
silence
during
which
they
are
all
at
home
feasting
the
streets
are
filled
with
noisy
crowds
and
every
is
thronged
every
night
there
are
illuminations
along
the
water
which
added
to
the
crowns
of
light
sparkling
on
the
hundred
minarets
and
domes
give
a
magical
effect
to
the
night
view
of
the
city
towards
midnight
there
is
again
a
season
of
comparative
quiet
most
of
the
inhabitants
having
retired
to
rest
but
about
two
hours
afterwards
a
watchman
comes
along
with
a
big
drum
which
he
beats
lustily
before
the
doors
of
the
faithful
in
order
to
arouse
them
in
time
to
eat
again
before
the
which
announces
the
commencement
of
another
day
fast
last
night
was
the
holiest
night
of
islam
being
the
of
the
fast
it
is
called
the
or
night
of
the
predestination
the
anniversary
of
that
on
which
the
koran
was
miraculously
communicated
to
the
prophet
on
this
night
the
sultan
accompanied
by
his
whole
suite
attends
service
at
the
mosque
and
on
his
return
to
the
seraglio
the
sultana
valide
or
presents
him
with
a
virgin
from
one
of
the
noble
families
of
constantinople
formerly
sophia
was
the
theatre
of
this
celebration
but
this
year
the
sultan
chose
the
mosque
of
tophaneh
which
stands
on
the
shore
probably
as
being
nearer
to
his
imperial
palace
at
beshiktashe
on
the
bosphorus
i
consider
myself
fortunate
in
having
reached
constantinople
in
season
to
witness
this
ceremony
and
the
illumination
of
the
golden
horn
which
accompanies
it
after
sunset
the
mosques
crowning
the
hills
of
stamboul
the
mosque
of
tophaneh
on
this
side
of
the
water
and
the
turkish
and
steamers
afloat
at
the
mouth
of
the
golden
horn
began
to
blaze
with
more
than
their
usual
brilliance
the
outlines
of
the
minarets
and
domes
were
drawn
in
light
on
the
deepening
gloom
and
the
masts
and
yards
of
the
vessel
were
hung
with
colored
lanterns
from
the
battery
in
front
of
the
mosque
and
arsenal
of
tophaneh
a
blaze
of
intense
light
streamed
out
over
the
water
illuminating
the
gliding
forms
of
a
thousand
caïques
and
the
dark
hulls
of
the
vessels
lying
at
anchor
the
water
is
the
best
place
from
which
to
view
the
illumination
and
a
party
of
us
descended
to
the
the
streets
of
tophaneh
were
crowded
with
swarms
of
turks
greeks
and
armenians
the
square
around
the
fountain
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
venders
of
sherbet
and
kaïmak
were
ranged
along
the
sidewalks
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
mosque
the
crowd
was
so
dense
that
we
could
with
difficulty
make
our
way
through
all
the
open
space
next
the
water
was
filled
up
with
the
clumsy
or
carriages
of
the
turks
in
which
sat
the
wives
of
the
pashas
and
other
dignitaries
we
took
a
caïque
and
were
soon
pulled
out
into
the
midst
of
a
multitude
of
other
caïques
swarming
all
over
the
surface
of
the
golden
horn
the
view
from
this
point
was
strange
fantastic
yet
inconceivably
gorgeous
in
front
three
or
four
large
turkish
frigates
lay
in
the
bosphorus
their
hulls
and
spars
outlined
in
fire
against
the
dark
hills
and
distant
twinkling
lights
of
asia
looking
to
the
west
the
shores
of
the
golden
horn
were
equally
traced
by
the
multitude
of
lamps
that
covered
them
and
on
either
side
the
hills
on
which
the
city
is
built
rose
from
the
water
masses
of
dark
buildings
dotted
all
over
with
shafts
and
domes
of
the
most
brilliant
light
the
gateway
on
seraglio
point
was
illuminated
as
well
as
the
quay
in
front
of
the
mosque
of
tophaneh
all
the
cannons
of
the
battery
being
covered
with
lamps
the
commonest
objects
shared
in
the
splendor
even
a
large
lever
used
for
hoisting
goods
being
hung
with
lanterns
from
top
to
bottom
the
mosque
was
a
mass
of
light
and
between
the
tall
minarets
flanking
it
burned
the
inscription
in
arabic
characters
long
life
to
you
o
our
sovereign
the
discharge
of
a
cannon
announced
the
sultan
departure
from
his
palace
and
immediately
the
guns
on
the
frigates
and
the
batteries
on
both
shores
took
up
the
salute
till
the
grand
echoes
filling
the
hollow
throat
of
the
golden
horn
crashed
from
side
to
side
striking
the
hills
of
scutari
and
the
point
of
chalcedon
and
finally
dying
away
among
the
summits
of
the
princes
islands
out
on
the
sea
of
marmora
the
hulls
of
the
frigates
were
now
lighted
up
with
intense
chemical
fires
and
an
abundance
of
rockets
were
spouted
from
their
decks
a
large
drummond
light
on
seraglio
point
and
another
at
the
battery
of
tophaneh
poured
their
rival
streams
across
the
golden
horn
revealing
the
thousands
of
caïques
jostling
each
other
from
shore
to
shore
and
the
endless
variety
of
gay
costumes
with
which
they
were
filled
the
smoke
of
the
cannon
hanging
in
the
air
increased
the
effect
of
this
illumination
and
became
a
screen
of
auroral
brightness
through
which
the
superb
spectacle
loomed
with
large
and
unreal
features
it
was
a
picture
of
air
a
phantasmagoric
spectacle
built
of
luminous
vapor
and
meteoric
fires
and
hanging
in
the
dark
round
of
space
in
spite
of
ourselves
we
became
eager
and
excited
half
fearing
that
the
whole
pageant
would
dissolve
the
next
moment
and
leave
no
trace
behind
meanwhile
the
cannon
thundered
from
a
dozen
batteries
and
the
rockets
burst
into
glittering
rain
over
our
heads
grander
discharges
i
never
heard
the
earth
shook
and
trembled
under
the
mighty
bursts
of
sound
and
the
reverberation
which
rattled
along
the
hill
of
galata
broken
by
the
scattered
buildings
into
innumerable
fragments
of
sound
resembled
the
crash
of
a
thousand
falling
houses
the
distant
echoes
from
asia
and
the
islands
in
the
sea
filled
up
the
pauses
between
the
nearer
peals
and
we
seemed
to
be
in
the
midst
of
some
great
naval
engagement
but
now
the
caïque
of
the
sultan
is
discerned
approaching
from
the
bosphorus
a
signal
is
given
and
a
sunrise
of
intense
rosy
and
golden
radiance
suddenly
lights
up
the
long
arsenal
and
stately
mosque
of
tophaneh
plays
over
the
tall
buildings
on
the
hill
of
pera
and
falls
with
a
fainter
lustre
on
the
genoese
that
overlooks
galata
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
effect
of
this
magical
illumination
the
mosque
with
its
taper
minarets
its
airy
galleries
and
its
great
central
dome
is
built
of
compact
transparent
flame
and
in
the
shifting
of
the
red
and
yellow
fires
seems
to
flicker
and
waver
in
the
air
it
is
as
lofty
and
gorgeous
and
unsubstantial
as
the
cloudy
palace
in
cole
picture
of
youth
the
long
white
front
of
the
arsenal
is
fused
in
crimson
heat
and
burns
against
the
dark
as
if
it
were
one
mass
of
living
coal
and
over
all
hangs
the
luminous
canopy
of
smoke
redoubling
its
lustre
on
the
waters
of
the
golden
horn
and
mingling
with
the
phosphorescent
gleams
that
play
around
the
oars
of
the
caïques
a
long
barge
propelled
by
sixteen
oars
glides
around
the
dark
corner
of
tophaneh
and
shoots
into
the
clear
brilliant
space
in
front
of
the
mosque
it
is
not
lighted
and
passes
with
great
swiftness
towards
the
brilliant
there
are
several
persons
seated
under
a
canopy
in
the
stern
and
we
are
trying
to
decide
which
is
the
sultan
when
a
second
boat
driven
by
oarsmen
comes
in
sight
the
men
rise
up
at
each
stroke
and
the
long
sharp
craft
flies
over
the
surface
of
the
water
rather
than
forces
its
way
through
it
a
gilded
crown
surmounts
the
long
curved
prow
and
a
light
though
superb
canopy
covers
the
stern
under
this
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
sultan
and
grand
vizier
as
they
appear
for
an
instant
like
black
silhouettes
against
the
burst
of
light
on
shore
after
the
sultan
had
entered
the
mosque
the
fires
diminished
and
the
cannon
ceased
though
the
illuminated
masts
minarets
and
gateways
still
threw
a
brilliant
gleam
over
the
scene
after
more
than
an
hour
spent
in
devotion
he
again
entered
his
caïque
and
sped
away
to
greet
his
new
wife
amid
a
fresh
discharge
from
the
frigates
and
the
batteries
on
both
shores
and
a
new
dawn
of
auroral
splendor
we
made
haste
to
reach
the
in
order
to
avoid
the
crowd
of
caïques
but
although
we
were
among
the
first
we
came
near
being
precipitated
into
the
water
in
the
struggle
to
get
ashore
the
at
tophaneh
was
so
crowded
that
nothing
but
main
force
brought
us
through
and
some
of
our
party
had
their
pockets
picked
a
number
of
turkish
soldiers
and
were
mixed
up
in
the
melee
and
they
were
not
sparing
of
blows
when
they
came
in
contact
with
a
giaour
in
making
my
way
through
i
found
that
a
collision
with
one
of
the
soldiers
was
inevitable
but
i
managed
to
plump
against
him
with
such
force
as
to
take
the
breath
out
of
his
body
and
was
out
of
his
reach
before
he
had
recovered
himself
i
saw
several
turkish
women
striking
right
and
left
in
their
endeavors
to
escape
and
place
their
hands
against
the
faces
of
those
who
opposed
them
pushing
them
aside
this
crowd
was
contrived
by
thieves
for
the
purpose
of
plunder
and
from
what
i
have
since
learned
must
have
been
very
successful
i
visited
the
college
of
the
mevlevi
dervishes
at
pera
and
witnessed
their
peculiar
ceremonies
they
assemble
in
a
large
hall
where
they
take
their
seats
in
a
facing
the
shekh
after
going
through
several
times
with
the
usual
moslem
prayer
they
move
in
slow
march
around
the
room
while
a
choir
in
the
gallery
chants
arabic
phrases
in
a
manner
very
similar
to
the
mass
in
catholic
churches
i
could
distinguish
the
sentences
god
is
great
praise
be
to
god
and
other
similar
ejaculations
the
chant
was
accompanied
with
a
drum
and
flute
and
had
not
lasted
long
before
the
dervishes
set
themselves
in
a
rotary
motion
spinning
slowly
around
the
shekh
who
stood
in
the
centre
they
stretched
both
arms
out
dropped
their
heads
on
one
side
and
glided
around
with
a
steady
regular
motion
their
long
white
gowns
spread
out
and
floating
on
the
air
their
steps
were
very
similar
to
those
of
the
modern
waltz
which
it
is
possible
may
have
been
derived
from
the
dance
of
the
mevlevis
baron
von
hammer
finds
in
this
ceremony
an
imitation
of
the
dance
of
the
spheres
in
the
ancient
samothracian
mysteries
but
i
see
no
reason
to
go
so
far
back
for
its
origin
the
dance
lasted
for
about
twenty
minutes
and
the
dervishes
appeared
very
much
exhausted
at
the
close
as
they
are
obliged
to
observe
the

of

and
yesterday
the
celebration
of
the
solemn
festival
of
bairam
took
place
the
moon
changed
on
friday
morning
at
but
as
the
turks
have
no
faith
in
astronomy
and
do
not
believe
the
moon
has
actually
changed
until
they
see
it
all
good
mussulmen
were
obliged
to
fast
an
additional
day
had
saturday
been
cloudy
and
the
new
moon
invisible
i
am
not
sure
but
the
fast
would
have
been
still
further
prolonged
a
good
was
kept
however
and
about
four
on
saturday
afternoon
some
sharp
eyes
saw
the
young
crescent
above
the
sun
there
is
a
hill
near
gemlik
on
the
gulf
of
moudania
about
fifty
miles
from
here
whence
the
turks
believe
the
new
moon
can
be
first
seen
the
families
who
live
on
this
hill
are
exempted
from
taxation
in
consideration
of
their
keeping
a
watch
for
the
moon
at
the
close
of
ramazan
a
series
of
signals
from
hill
to
hill
is
in
readiness
and
the
news
is
transmitted
to
constantinople
in
a
very
short
time
then
when
the
muezzin
proclaims
the
or
prayer
two
hours
before
sunset
he
proclaims
also
the
close
of
ramazan
all
the
batteries
fire
a
salute
and
the
big
guns
along
the
water
announce
the
joyful
news
to
all
parts
of
the
city
the
forts
on
the
bosphorus
take
up
the
tale
and
both
shores
from
the
black
sea
to
the
propontis
shake
with
the
burden
of
their
rejoicing
at
night
the
mosques
are
illuminated
for
the
last
time
for
it
is
only
during
ramazan
that
they
are
lighted
or
open
for
night
service
after
ramazan
comes
the
festival
of
bairam
which
lasts
three
days
and
is
a
season
of
unbounded
rejoicing
the
bazaars
are
closed
no
turk
does
any
work
but
all
clothed
in
their
best
dresses
or
in
an
entire
new
suit
if
they
can
afford
it
pass
the
time
in
feasting
in
paying
visits
or
in
making
excursions
to
the
shores
of
the
bosphorus
or
other
favorite
spots
around
constantinople
the
festival
is
inaugurated
by
a
solemn
state
ceremony
at
the
seraglio
and
the
mosque
of
sultan
achmed
whither
the
sultan
goes
in
procession
accompanied
by
all
the
officers
of
the
government
this
is
the
last
remaining
pageant
which
has
been
spared
to
the
ottoman
monarchs
by
the
rigorous
reforming
measures
of
sultan
mahmoud
and
shorn
as
it
is
of
much
of
its
former
splendor
it
probably
surpasses
in
brilliant
effect
any
spectacle
which
any
other
european
court
can
present
the
ceremonies
which
take
place
inside
of
the
seraglio
were
until
within
three
or
four
years
prohibited
to
frank
eyes
and
travellers
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
a
view
of
the
procession
as
it
passed
to
the
mosque
through
the
kindness
of
brown
of
the
american
embassy
i
was
enabled
to
witness
the
entire
solemnity
in
all
its
details
as
the
procession
leaves
the
seraglio
at
sunrise
we
rose
with
the
first
streak
of
dawn
descended
to
tophaneh
and
crossed
to
seraglio
point
where
the
cavass
of
the
embassy
was
in
waiting
for
us
he
conducted
us
through
the
guards
into
the
garden
of
the
seraglio
and
up
the
hill
to
the
palace
the
capudan
pasha
or
lord
high
admiral
had
just
arrived
in
a
splendid
caïque
and
pranced
up
the
hill
before
us
on
a
magnificent
stallion
whose
trappings
blazed
with
jewels
and
gold
lace
the
rich
uniforms
of
the
different
officers
of
the
army
and
marine
glittered
far
and
near
under
the
dense
shadows
of
the
cypress
trees
and
down
the
dark
alleys
where
the
morning
twilight
had
not
penetrated
we
were
ushered
into
the
great
outer
of
the
seraglio
leading
to
the
sublime
porte
a
double
row
of
marines
in
scarlet
jackets
and
white
trowsers
extended
from
one
gate
to
the
other
and
a
very
excellent
brass
band
played
la
with
much
spirit
the
groups
of
pashas
and
other
officers
of
high
rank
with
their
attendants
gave
the
scene
a
brilliant
character
of
festivity
the
costumes
except
those
of
the
secretaries
and
servants
were
after
the
european
model
but
covered
with
a
lavish
profusion
of
gold
lace
the
horses
were
all
of
the
choicest
eastern
breeds
and
the
broad
housings
of
their
saddles
of
blue
green
purple
and
crimson
cloth
were
enriched
with
gold
lace
rubies
emeralds
and
turquoises
the
cavass
took
us
into
a
chamber
near
the
gate
and
commanding
a
view
of
the
whole
court
there
we
found
brown
and
his
lady
with
several
officers
from
the
steamer
san
jacinto
at
this
moment
the
sun
appearing
above
the
hill
of
bulgaria
behind
scutari
threw
his
earliest
rays
upon
the
gilded
pinnacles
of
the
seraglio
the
commotion
in
the
long
below
increased
the
marines
were
formed
into
exact
line
the
horses
of
the
officers
clattered
on
the
rough
pavement
as
they
dashed
about
to
expedite
the
arrangements
the
crowd
pressed
closer
to
the
line
of
the
procession
and
in
five
minutes
the
grand
pageant
was
set
in
motion
as
the
first
pasha
made
his
appearance
under
the
dark
archway
of
the
interior
gate
the
band
struck
up
the
which
is
a
favorite
air
among
the
turks
and
the
soldiers
presented
arms
the
was
near
two
hundred
yards
long
and
the
line
of
pashas
each
surrounded
with
the
officers
of
his
staff
made
a
most
dazzling
show
the
lowest
in
rank
came
first
i
can
not
recollect
the
precise
order
nor
the
names
of
all
of
them
which
in
fact
are
of
little
consequence
while
power
and
place
are
such
uncertain
matters
in
turkey
each
pasha
wore
the
red
fez
on
his
head
a
of
blue
cloth
the
breast
of
which
was
entirely
covered
with
gold
lace
while
a
broad
band
of
the
same
decorated
the
skirts
and
white
pantaloons
one
of
the
ministers
mehemet
ali
pasha
the
of
the
sultan
was
formerly
a
cooper
apprentice
but
taken
when
a
boy
by
the
late
sultan

to
be
a
playmate
for
his
son
on
account
of
his
extraordinary
beauty
rescind
pasha
the
grand
vizier
is
a
man
of
about
sixty
years
of
age
he
is
frequently
called
giaour
or
infidel
by
the
turks
on
account
of
his
liberal
policy
which
has
made
him
many
enemies
the
expression
of
his
face
denotes
intelligence
but
lacks
the
energy
necessary
to
accomplish
great
reforms
his
son
a
boy
of
about
seventeen
already
possesses
the
rank
of
pasha
and
is
affianced
to
the
sultan
daughter
a
child
of
ten
or
twelve
years
old
he
is
a
fat
handsome
youth
with
a
sprightly
face
and
acted
his
part
in
the
ceremonies
with
a
nonchalance
which
made
him
appear
graceful
beside
his
stiff
dignified
elders
after
the
pashas
came
the
entire
household
of
the
sultan
including
even
his
eunuchs

and
constables

most
important
personages

court
the
sultan
favorite
dwarf
a
little
man
about
forty
years
old
and
three
feet
high
bestrode
his
horse
with
as
consequential
an
air
as
any
of
them
a
few
years
ago
this
man
took
a
notion
to
marry
and
applied
to
the
sultan
for
a
wife
the
latter
gave
him
permission
to
go
into
his
harem
and
take
the
one
whom
he
could
kiss
the
dwarf
like
all
short
men
was
ambitious
to
have
a
long
wife
while
the
sultan
five
hundred
women
who
knew
the
terms
according
to
which
the
dwarf
was
permitted
to
choose
were
laughing
at
the
amorous
mannikin
he
went
up
to
one
of
the
tallest
and
handsomest
of
them
and
struck
her
a
sudden
blow
on
the
stomach
she
collapsed
with
the
pain
and
before
she
could
recover
he
caught
her
by
the
neck
and
gave
her
the
dreaded
kiss
the
sultan
kept
his
word
and
the
tall
beauty
is
now
the
mother
of
the
dwarfs
children
the
procession
grows
more
brilliant
as
it
advances
and
the
profound
inclination
made
by
the
soldiers
at
the
further
end
of
the
court
announces
the
approach
of
the
sultan
himself
first
come
three
led
horses
of
the
noblest
arabian
blood
glorious
creatures
worthy
to
represent
the
horse
that
guide
the
golden
eye
of
heaven
and
snort
the
morning
from
their
nostrils
making
their
fiery
gait
above
the
glades
their
eyes
were
more
keen
and
lustrous
than
the
diamonds
which
studded
their
and
the
wealth
of
emeralds
rubies
and
sapphires
that
gleamed
on
their
trappings
would
have
bought
the
possessions
of
a
german
prince
after
them
came
the
sultan
a
company
of
tall
strong
men
in
crimson
tunics
and
white
trousers
with
lofty
plumes
of
peacock
feathers
in
their
hats
some
of
them
carried
crests
of
green
feathers
fastened
upon
long
staves
these
superb
horses
and
showy
guards
are
the
only
relics
of
that
barbaric
pomp
which
characterized
all
state
processions
during
the
time
of
the
janissaries
in
the
centre
of
a
hollow
square
of
guards
rode
himself
on
a
steed
every
one
bowed
profoundly
as
he
passed
along
but
he
neither
looked
to
the
right
or
left
nor
made
the
slightest
acknowledgment
of
the
salutations
turkish
etiquette
exacts
the
most
rigid
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
sovereign
who
on
all
public
occasions
never
makes
a
greeting
formerly
before
the
change
of
costume
the
sultan
turbans
were
carried
before
him
in
the
processions
and
the
servants
who
bore
them
inclined
them
to
one
side
and
the
other
in
answer
to
the
salutations
of
the
crowd
sultan
is
a
man
of
about
thirty
though
he
looks
older
he
has
a
mild
amiable
weak
face
dark
eyes
a
prominent
nose
and
short
dark
brown
mustaches
and
beard
his
face
is
thin
and
wrinkles
are
already
making
their
appearance
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
eyes
but
for
a
certain
vacancy
of
expression
he
would
be
called
a
handsome
man
he
sits
on
his
horse
with
much
ease
and
grace
though
there
is
a
slight
stoop
in
his
shoulders
his
legs
are
crooked
owing
to
which
cause
he
appears
awkward
when
on
his
feet
though
he
wears
a
long
cloak
to
conceal
the
deformity
sensual
indulgence
has
weakened
a
constitution
not
naturally
strong
and
increased
that
mildness
which
has
now
become
a
defect
in
his
character
he
is
not
stern
enough
to
be
just
and
his
subjects
are
less
fortunate
under
his
easy
rule
than
under
the
rod
of
his
savage
father
mahmoud
he
was
dressed
in
a
style
of
the
utmost
richness
and
elegance
he
wore
a
red
turkish
fez
with
an
immense
rosette
of
brilliants
and
a
long
floating
plume
of
feathers
the
diamond
in
the
centre
of
the
rosette
is
of
unusual
size
it
was
picked
up
some
years
ago
in
the
hippodrome
and
probably
belonged
to
the
treasury
of
the
greek
emperors
the
breast
and
collar
of
his
coat
were
one
mass
of
diamonds
and
sparkled
in
the
early
sun
with
a
thousand
rainbow
gleams
his
mantle
of
cloth
hung
to
his
knees
concealing
the
deformity
of
his
legs
he
wore
white
pantaloons
white
kid
gloves
and
patent
leather
boots
thrust
into
his
golden
stirrups
a
few
officers
of
the
imperial
household
followed
behind
the
sultan
and
the
procession
then
terminated
including
the
soldiers
it
contained
from
two
to
three
thousand
persons
the
marines
lined
the
way
to
the
mosque
of
sultan
achmed
and
a
great
crowd
of
spectators
filled
up
the
streets
and
the
square
of
the
hippodrome
coffee
was
served
to
us
after
which
we
were
all
conducted
into
the
inner
court
of
the
seraglio
to
await
the
return
of
the
cortège
this
court
is
not
more
than
half
the
size
of
the
outer
one
but
is
shaded
with
large
sycamores
embellished
with
fountains
and
surrounded
with
light
and
elegant
galleries
in
pure
saracenic
style
the
picture
which
it
presented
was
therefore
far
richer
and
more
characteristic
of
the
orient
than
the
outer
court
where
the
architecture
is
almost
wholly
after
italian
models
the
portals
at
either
end
rested
on
slender
pillars
over
which
projected
broad
eaves
decorated
with
elaborate
carved
and
gilded
work
and
above
all
rose
a
dome
surmounted
by
the
crescent
on
the
right
the
tall
chimneys
of
the
imperial
kitchens
towered
above
the
walls
the
sycamores
threw
their
broad
cool
shadows
over
the
court
and
groups
of
servants
in
gala
dresses
loitered
about
the
corridors
after
waiting
nearly
half
an
hour
the
sound
of
music
and
the
appearance
of
the
sultan
proclaimed
the
return
of
the
procession
it
came
in
reversed
order
headed
by
the
sultan
after
whom
followed
the
grand
vizier
and
other
ministers
of
the
imperial
council
and
the
pashas
each
surrounded
by
his
staff
of
officers
the
sultan
dismounted
at
the
entrance
to
the
seraglio
and
disappeared
through
the
door
he
was
absent
for
more
than
half
an
hour
during
which
time
he
received
the
congratulations
of
his
family
his
wives
and
the
principal
personages
of
his
household
all
of
whom
came
to
kiss
his
feet
meanwhile
the
pashas
ranged
themselves
in
a
semicircle
around
the
arched
and
gilded
portico
the
servants
of
the
seraglio
brought
out
a
large
persian
carpet
which
they
spread
on
the
marble
pavement
the
throne
a
large
square
seat
richly
carved
and
covered
with
gilding
was
placed
in
the
centre
and
a
dazzling
piece
of
thrown
over
the
back
of
it
when
the
sultan
he
took
his
seat
thereon
placing
his
feet
on
a
small
footstool
the
ceremony
of
kissing
his
feet
now
commenced
the
first
who
had
this
honor
was
the
chief
of
the
emirs
an
old
man
in
a
green
robe
embroidered
with
pearls
he
advanced
to
the
throne
knelt
kissed
the
sultan
boot
and
retired
backward
from
the
presence
the
ministers
and
pashas
followed
in
single
file
and
after
they
had
made
the
salutation
took
their
stations
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
most
of
them
were
fat
and
their
glittering
were
buttoned
so
tightly
that
they
seemed
ready
to
burst
it
required
a
great
effort
for
them
to
rise
from
their
knees
during
all
this
time
the
band
was
playing
operatic
airs
and
as
each
pasha
knelt
a
marshal
or
master
of
ceremonies
with
a
silver
wand
gave
the
signal
to
the
imperial
guard
who
shouted
at
the
top
of
their
voices
prosperity
to
our
sovereign
may
he
live
a
thousand
years
this
part
of
the
ceremony
was
really
grand
and
imposing
all
the
adjuncts
were
in
keeping
the
portico
wrought
in
rich
arabesque
designs
the
swelling
domes
and
sunlit
crescents
above
the
sycamores
and
cypresses
shading
the
court
the
red
tunics
and
peacock
plumes
of
the
guard
the
monarch
himself
radiant
with
jewels
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
of
gold
all
these
features
combined
to
form
a
stately
picture
of
the
lost
orient
and
for
the
time
seemed
the
true
representative
of
caliph
haroun
after
the
pashas
had
finished
the
inferior
officers
of
the
army
navy
and
civil
service
followed
to
the
number
of
at
least
a
thousand
they
were
not
considered
worthy
to
touch
the
sultan
person
but
kissed
his
golden
scarf
which
was
held
out
to
them
by
a
pasha
who
stood
on
the
left
of
the
throne
the
grand
vizier
had
his
place
on
the
right
and
the
chief
of
the
eunuchs
stood
behind
him
the
kissing
of
the
scarf
occupied
an
hour
the
sultan
sat
quietly
during
all
this
time
his
face
expressing
a
total
indifference
to
all
that
was
going
on
the
most
skilful
physiognomist
could
not
have
found
in
it
the
shadow
of
an
expression
if
this
was
the
etiquette
prescribed
for
him
he
certainly
acted
it
with
marvellous
skill
and
success
the
long
line
of
officers
at
length
came
to
an
end
and
i
fancied
that
the
solemnities
were
now
over
but
after
a
pause
appeared
the
or
high
priest
of
the
mahometan
religion
his
authority
in
religious
matters
transcends
that
of
the
sultan
and
is
final
and
irrevocable
he
was
a
very
venerable
man
of
perhaps
years
of
age
and
his
tottering
steps
were
supported
by
two
mollahs
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
green
robe
embroidered
with
gold
and
pearls
over
which
his
white
beard
flowed
below
his
waist
in
his
turban
of
white
cambric
was
twisted
a
scarf
of
he
kissed
the
border
of
the
mantle
which
salutation
was
also
made
by
a
long
line
of
the
chief
priests
of
the
mosques
of
constantinople
who
followed
him
these
priests
were
dressed
in
long
robes
of
white
green
blue
and
violet
many
of
them
with
collars
of
pearls
and
golden
scarfs
wound
about
their
turbans
the
rich
fringes
falling
on
their
shoulders
they
were
grave
stately
men
with
long
gray
beards
and
the
wisdom
of
age
and
study
in
their
eyes
among
the
last
who
came
was
the
most
important
personage
of
all
this
was
the
governor
of
mecca
as
i
believe
he
is
called
the
nearest
descendant
of
the
prophet
and
the
successor
to
the
caliphate
in
case
the
family
of
othman
becomes
extinct
sultan
mahmoud
on
his
accession
to
the
throne
was
the
last
descendant
of
orchan
the
founder
of
the
ottoman
dynasty
the
throne
being
inherited
only
by
the
male
heirs
he
left
two
sons
who
are
both
living
having
departed
from
the
practice
of
his
predecessors
each
of
whom
slew
his
brothers
in
order
to
make
his
own
sovereignty
secure
he
has
one
son
muzad
who
is
about
ten
years
old
so
that
there
are
now
three
males
of
the
family
of
orchan
in
case
of
their
death
the
governor
of
mecca
would
become
caliph
and
the
sovereignty
would
be
established
in
his
family
he
is
a
swarthy
arab
of
about
fifty
with
a
bold
fierce
face
he
wore
a
superb
dress
of
green
the
sacred
color
and
was
followed
by
his
two
sons
young
men
of
twenty
and
as
he
advanced
to
the
throne
and
was
about
to
kneel
and
kiss
the
sultan
robe
the
latter
prevented
him
and
asked
politely
after
his
health
the
highest
mark
of
respect
in
his
power
to
show
the
old
face
gleamed
with
such
a
sudden
gush
of
pride
and
satisfaction
that
no
flash
of
lightning
could
have
illumined
it
more
vividly
the
sacred
writers
or
transcribers
of
the
koran
closed
the
procession
after
which
the
sultan
rose
and
entered
the
seraglio
the
crowd
slowly
dispersed
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
grand
reports
of
the
cannon
on
seraglio
point
announced
the
departure
of
the
sultan
for
his
palace
on
the
bosphorus
the
festival
of
bairam
was
now
fairly
inaugurated
and
all
stamboul
was
given
up
to
festivity
there
was
no
turk
so
poor
that
he
did
not
in
some
sort
share
in
the
rejoicing
our
fourth
could
scarcely
show
more
flags
let
off
more
big

or
send

of

the
length
of
my
stay
in
constantinople
has
enabled
me
to
visit
many
interesting
spots
in
its
vicinity
as
well
as
to
familiarize
myself
with
the
peculiar
features
of
the
great
capital
i
have
seen
the
beautiful
bosphorus
from
steamers
and
caïques
ridden
up
the
valley
of
buyukdere
and
through
the
chestnut
woods
of
belgrade
bathed
in
the
black
sea
under
the
lee
of
the
symplegades
where
the
marble
altar
to
apollo
still
invites
an
oblation
from
passing
mariners
walked
over
the
flowery
meadows
beside
the
heavenly
waters
of
asia
galloped
around
the
walls
where
dandolo
and
mahomet
ii
conquered
and
the
last
of
the
palæologi
fell
and
dreamed
away
many
an
under
the
funereal
cypresses
of
pera
and
beside
the
delphian
tripod
in
the
hippodrome
the
historic
interest
of
these
spots
is
familiar
to
all
nor
with
one
exception
have
their
natural
beauties
been
exaggerated
by
travellers
this
exception
is
the
village
of
belgrade
over
which
mary
montague
went
into
raptures
and
set
the
fashion
for
tourists
ever
since
i
must
confess
to
having
been
wofully
disappointed
the
village
is
a
miserable
cluster
of
rickety
houses
on
an
open
piece
of
barren
land
surrounded
by
the
forests
or
rather
thickets
which
keep
alive
the
springs
that
supply
constantinople
with
water
we
reached
there
with
appetites
sharpened
by
our
morning
ride
expecting
to
find
at
least
a
vender
of
bits
of
fried
meat
in
so
renowned
a
place
but
the
only
things
to
be
had
were
raw
salt
mackerel
and
bread
which
belonged
to
the
primitive
geological
formation
the
general
features
of
constantinople
and
the
bosphorus
are
so
well
known
that
i
am
spared
the
dangerous
task
of
painting
scenes
which
have
been
colored
by
abler
pencils
von

lamartine
willis
miss
pardoe
albert
smith
and
thou
most
inimitable
thackeray
have
made

and

the
bazaars
and
baths
the
seraglio
and
the
golden
horn
as
familiar
to
our
ears
as
cornhill
and
wall
street
besides
constantinople
is
not
the
true
orient
which
is
to
be
found
rather
in
cairo
in
aleppo
and
brightest
and
most
vital
in
damascus
here
we
tread
european
soil
the
franks
are
fast
crowding
out
the
followers
of
the
prophet
and
stamboul
itself
were
its
mosques
and
seraglio
removed
would
differ
little
in
outward
appearance
from
a
italian
town
the
sultan
lives
in
a
palace
with
a
grecian
portico
the
pointed
saracenic
arch
the
arabesque
sculptures
the
latticed
balconies
give
place
to
clumsy
imitations
of
palladio
and
every
fire
that
sweeps
away
a
recollection
of
the
palmy
times
of
ottoman
rule
sweeps
it
away
forever
but
the
mosque
that
blossom
of
oriental
architecture
with
its
crowning
domes
like
the
inverted
bells
of
the
lotus
and
its
minarets
its
fountains
and
marble
courts
can
only
perish
with
the
faith
it
typifies
i
for
one
rejoice
that
so
long
as
the
religion
of
islam
exists
and
yet
may
its
time
be
short
no
christian
model
can
shape
its
houses
of
worship
the
minaret
must
still
lift
its
airy
tower
for
the
muezzin
the
dome
must
rise
like
a
gilded
heaven
above
the
prayers
of
the
faithful
with
its
starry
lamps
and
emblazoned
phrases
the
fountain
must
continue
to
pour
its
waters
of
purification
a
reformation
of
the
moslem
faith
is
impossible
when
it
begins
to
give
way
the
whole
fabric
must
fall
its
ceremonies
as
well
as
its
creed
rest
entirely
on
the
recognition
of
mahomet
as
the
prophet
of
god
however
the
turks
may
change
in
other
respects
in
all
that
concerns
their
religion
they
must
continue
the
same
until
within
a
few
years
a
visit
to
the
mosques
especially
the
more
sacred
ones
of
sophia
and
sultan
achmed
was
attended
with
much
difficulty
miss
pardoe
according
to
her
own
account
risked
her
life
in
order
to
see
the
interior
of
sophia
which
she
effected
in
the
disguise
of
a
turkish
effendi
i
accomplished
the
same
thing
a
few
days
since
but
without
recourse
to
any
such
romantic
expedient
brown
the
interpreter
of
the
legation
procured
a
firman
from
the
grand
vizier
on
behalf
of
the
officers
of
the
san
jacinto
and
kindly
invited
me
with
several
other
american
and
english
travellers
to
join
the
party
during
the
month
of
ramazan
no
firmans
are
given
and
as
at
this
time
there
are
few
travellers
in
constantinople
we
should
otherwise
have
been
subjected
to
a
heavy
expense
the
cost
of
a
firman
including
backsheesh
to
the
priests
and
doorkeepers
is
piastres
about
we
crossed
the
golden
horn
in
caïques
and
first
visited
the
gardens
and
palaces
on
seraglio
point
the
sultan
at
present
resides
in
his
summer
palace
of
beshiktashe
on
the
bosphorus
and
only
occupies
the
serai
bornou
as
it
is
called
during
the
winter
months
the
seraglio
covers
the
extremity
of
the
promontory
on
which
constantinople
is
built
and
is
nearly
three
miles
in
circuit
the
scattered
buildings
erected
by
different
sultans
form
in
themselves
a
small
city
whose
domes
and
pointed
turrets
rise
from
amid
groves
of
cypress
and
pine
the
is
lined
with
kiosks
from
whose
cushioned
windows
there
are
the
loveliest
views
of
the
european
and
asian
shores
the
newer
portion
of
the
palace
where
the
sultan
now
receives
the
ambassadors
of
foreign
nations
shows
the
influence
of
european
taste
in
its
plan
and
decorations
it
is
by
no
means
remarkable
for
splendor
and
suffers
by
contrast
with
many
of
the
private
houses
in
damascus
and
aleppo
the
building
is
of
wood
the
walls
ornamented
with
detestable
frescoes
by
modern
greek
artists
and
except
a
small
but
splendid
collection
of
arms
and
some
wonderful
specimens
of
arabic
chirography
there
is
nothing
to
interest
the
visitor
in
ascending
to
the
ancient
seraglio
which
was
founded
by
mahomet
on
the
site
of
the
palace
of
the
palæologi
we
passed
the
column
of
theodosius
a
plain
corinthian
shaft
about
fifty
feet
high
the
seraglio
is
now
occupied
entirely
by
the
servants
and
guards
and
the
greater
part
of
it
shows
a
neglect
amounting
almost
to
dilapidation
the
saracenic
corridors
surrounding
its
courts
are
supported
by
pillars
of
marble
granite
and
porphyry
the
spoils
of
the
christian
capital
we
were
allowed
to
walk
about
at
leisure
and
inspect
the
different
compartments
except
the
library
which
unfortunately
was
locked
this
library
was
for
a
long
time
supposed
to
contain
many
lost
treasures
of
ancient
literature
among
other
things
the
missing
books
of
livy
but
the
recent
researches
of
logothetos
the
prince
of
samos
prove
that
there
is
little
of
value
among
its
manuscripts
before
the
door
hangs
a
wooden
globe
which
is
supposed
to
be
efficacious
in
neutralizing
the
influence
of
the
evil
eye
there
are
many
ancient
altars
and
fragments
of
pillars
scattered
about
the
courts
and
the
turks
have
even
commenced
making
a
collection
of
antiquities
which
with
the
exception
of
two
immense
sarcophagi
of
red
porphyry
contains
nothing
of
value
they
show
however
one
of
the
brazen
heads
of
the
delphian
tripod
in
the
hippodrome
which
they
say
mahomet
the
conqueror
struck
off
with
a
single
blow
of
his
sword
on
entering
constantinople
the
most
interesting
portion
of
the
seraglio
is
the
ancient
now
no
longer
used
but
still
guarded
by
a
company

the

is
an
immense
heavy
bedstead
the
posts
of
which
are
thickly
incrusted
with
rubies

there
half
a
century
ago
the
foreign
ambassadors
were
presented
after
having
been
bathed
fed
and
clothed
with
a
rich
mantle
in
the
outer
apartments
they
were
ushered
into
the
imperial
presence
supported
by
a
turkish
official
on
either
side
in
order
that
they
might
show
no
signs
of
breaking
down
under
the
load
of
awe
and
reverence
they
were
supposed
to
feel
in
the
outer
court
adjoining
the
sublime
porte
is
the
chapel
of
the
empress
irene
now
converted
into
an
armory
which
for
its
size
is
the
most
tasteful
and
picturesque
collection
of
weapons
i
have
ever
seen
it
is
especially
rich
in
saracenic
armor
and
contains
many
superb
casques
of
inlaid
gold
in
a
large
glass
case
in
the
chancel
one
sees
the
keys
of
some
thirty
or
forty
cities
with
the
date
of
their
capture
it
is
not
likely
that
another
will
ever
be
added
to
the
list
we
now
passed
out
through
the
sublime
porte
and
directed
our
steps
to
the
famous
the
temple
dedicated
by
justinian
to
the
divine
wisdom
the
repairs
made
to
the
outer
walls
by
the
turks
and
the
addition
of
the
four
minarets
have
entirely
changed
the
character
of
the
building
without
injuring
its
effect
as
a
christian
church
it
must
have
been
less
imposing
than
in
its
present
form
a
priest
met
us
at
the
entrance
and
after
reading
the
firman
with
a
very
discontented
face
informed
us
that
we
could
not
enter
until
the
prayers
were
concluded
after
taking
off
our
shoes
however
we
were
allowed
to
ascend
to
the
galleries
whence
we
looked
down
on
the
bowing
worshippers
here
the
majesty
of
the
renowned
edifice
despoiled
as
it
now
is
bursts
at
once
upon
the
eye
the
wonderful
flat
dome
glittering
with
its
golden
mosaics
and
the
sacred
phrase
from
the
koran
is
the
light
of
the
heavens
and
the
swims
in
the
air
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
above
the
marble
pavement
on
the
eastern
and
western
sides
it
rests
on
two
half
domes
which
again
rise
from
or
rest
upon
a
group
of
three
small
so
that
the
entire
roof
of
the
mosque
unsupported
by
a
pillar
seems
to
have
been
dropped
from
above
on
the
walls
rather
than
to
have
been
built
up
from
them
around
the
edifice
run
an
upper
and
a
lower
gallery
which
alone
preserve
the
peculiarities
of
the
byzantine
style
these
galleries
are
supported
by
the
most
precious
columns
which
ancient
art
could
afford
among
them
eight
shafts
of
green
marble
from
the
temple
of
diana
at
ephesus
eight
of
porphyry
from
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
baalbek
besides
egyptian
granite
from
the
shrines
of
isis
and
osiris
and
pentelican
marble
from
the
sanctuary
of
pallas
athena
almost
the
whole
of
the
interior
has
been
covered
with
gilding
but
time
has
softened
its
brilliancy
and
the
rich
subdued
gleam
of
the
walls
is
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
varied
coloring
of
the
ancient
marbles
under
the
dome
four
christian
seraphim
executed
in
mosaic
have
been
allowed
to
remain
but
the
names
of
the
four
archangels
of
the
moslem
faith
are
inscribed
underneath
the
bronze
doors
are
still
the
same
the
turks
having
taken
great
pains
to
obliterate
the
crosses
with
which
they
were
adorned
around
the
centre
of
the
dome
as
on
that
of
sultan
achmed
may
be
read
in
golden
letters
and
in
all
the
intricacy
of
arabic
penmanship
the
beautiful
verse
god
is
the
light
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
his
wisdom
is
a
light
on
the
wall
in
which
burns
a
lamp
covered
with
glass
the
glass
shines
like
a
star
the
lamp
is
lit
with
the
oil
of
a
blessed
tree
no
eastern
no
western
oil
it
shines
for
whoever
wills
after
the
prayers
were
over
and
we
had
descended
to
the
floor
of
the
mosque
i
spent
the
rest
of
my
time
under
the
dome
fascinated
by
its
marvellous
lightness
and
beauty
the
worshippers
present
looked
at
us
with
curiosity
but
without
and
before
we
left
one
of
the
priests
came
slyly
with
some
fragments
of
the
ancient
gilded
mosaic
which
he
was
heathen
enough
to
sell
and
we
to
buy
from
sophia
we
went
to
sultan
achmed
which
faces
the
hippodrome
and
is
one
of
the
stateliest
piles
of
constantinople
it
is
avowedly
an
imitation
of
sophia
and
the
turks
consider
it
a
more
wonderful
work
because
the
dome
is
seven
feet
higher
it
has
six
minarets
exceeding
in
this
respect
all
the
mosques
of
asia
the
dome
rests
on
four
immense
pillars
the
bulk
of
which
quite
oppresses
the
light
galleries
running
around
the
walls
this
and
the
uniform
white
color
of
the
interior
impairs
the
effect
which
its
bold
style
and
imposing
dimensions
would
otherwise
produce
the
outside
view
with
the
group
of
domes
swelling
grandly
above
the
rows
of
sycamores
is
much
more
satisfactory
in
the
tomb
of
sultan
achmed
in
one
corner
of
the
court
we
saw
his
coffin
turban
sword
and
jewelled
harness
i
had
just
been
reading
old
sandys
account
of
his
visit
to
constantinople
in
during
this
sultan
reign
and
could
only
think
of
him
as
sandys
represents
him
in
the
to
his
book
as
a
fat
man
with
bloated
cheeks
in
a
long
gown
and
big
turban
and
the
words
underneath
sive
the
other
noted
mosques
of
constantinople
are
the
djami
or
mosque
of
the
sultana
valide
on
the
shore
of
the
golden
horn
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
to
galata
that
of
sultan
bajazet
of
mahomet
the
conqueror
and
of
his
son
suleyman
the
magnificent
whose
superb
mosque
well
deserves
this
title
i
regret
exceedingly
that
our
time
did
not
allow
us
to
view
the
interior
for
outwardly
it
not
only
surpasses
sophia
and
all
other
mosques
in
the
city
but
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
purest
specimens
of
oriental
architecture
extant
it
stands
on
a
broad
terrace
on
one
of
the
seven
hills
of
stamboul
and
its
exquisitely
proportioned
domes
and
minarets
shine
as
if
crystalized
in
the
blue
of
the
air
it
is
a
type
of
oriental
as
the
parthenon
is
of
grecian
and
the
cologne
cathedral
of
gothic
art
as
i
saw
it
the
other
night
lit
by
the
flames
of
a
conflagration
standing
out
red
and
clear
against
the
darkness
i
felt
inclined
to
place
it
on
a
level
with
either
of
those
renowned
structures
it
is
a
product
of
the
rich
fancy
of
the
east
splendidly
ornate
and
not
without
a
high
degree
of
symmetry
yet
here
the
symmetry
is
that
of
ornament
alone
and
not
the
pure
absolute
proportion
of
forms
which
we
find
in
grecian
art
it
requires
a
certain
degree
of
enthusiasm
nay
a
slight
inebriation
of
the
imaginative
faculties
in
order
to
feel
the
sentiment
of
this
oriental
architecture
if
i
rightly
express
all
that
it
says
to
me
i
touch
the
verge
of
rapsody
the
east
in
almost
all
its
aspects
is
so
essentially
poetic
that
a
true
picture
of
it
must
be
poetic
in
spirit
if
not
in
form
constantinople
has
been
terribly
ravaged
by
fires
no
less
than
fifteen
having
occurred
during
the
past
two
weeks
almost
every
night
the
sky
has
been
reddened
by
burning
houses
and
the
minarets
of
the
seven
hills
lighted
with
an
illumination
brighter
than
that
of
the
bairam
all
the
space
from
the
hippodrome
to
the
sea
of
marmora
has
been
swept
away
the
lard
honey
and
oil
magazines
on
the
golden
horn
with
the
bazaars
adjoining
several
large
blocks
on
the
hill
of
galata
with
the
college
of
the
dancing
dervishes
a
part
of
scutari
and
the
college
of
the
howling
dervishes
all
have
disappeared
and
the
ruins
of
houses
which
were
destroyed
last
night
stand
smoking
in
the
greek
quarter
behind
the
aqueduct
of
valens
the
entire
amount
of
buildings
consumed
in
these
two
weeks
is
estimated
at
between
and
six
the
fire
on
the
hill
of
galata
threatened
to
destroy
a
great
part
of
the
suburb
of
pera
it
came
sweeping
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
towards
my
hotel
turning
the
tall
cypresses
in
the
burial
ground
into
shafts
of
angry
flame
and
eating
away
the
crackling
dwellings
of
hordes
of
hapless
turks
i
was
in
bed
from
a
sudden
attack
of
fever
but
seeing
the
other
guests
packing
up
their
effects
and
preparing
to
leave
i
was
obliged
to
do
the
same
and
this
in
my
weak
state
brought
on
such
a
perspiration
that
the
ailment
left
me
the
officers
of
the
united
states
steamer
and
the
french
frigate
came
to
the
rescue
with
their
men
and
and
the
flames
were
finally
quelled
the
proceedings
of
the
americans
who
cut
holes
in
the
roofs
and
played
through
them
upon
the
fires
within
were
watched
by
the
turks
with
stupid
amazement
máshallah
said
a
fat
bimbashi
as
he
stood
sweltering
in
the
heat
the
franks
are
a
wonderful
people
to
those
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
turkish
politics
these
fires
are
more
than
accidental
they
have
a
most
weighty
significance
they
indicate
either
a
general
discontent
with
the
existing
state
of
affairs
or
else
a
powerful
plot
against
the
sultan
and
his
ministry
setting
fire
to
houses
is
in
fact
the
turkish
method
of
holding
an
indignation
meeting
and
from
the
rate
with
which
they
are
increasing
the
political
crisis
must
be
near
at
hand
the
sultan
with
his
usual
kindness
of
heart
has
sent
large
quantities
of
tents
and
other
supplies
to
the
guiltless
sufferers
but
no
amount
of
kindness
can
soften
the
rancor
of
these
turkish
intrigues
reschid
pasha
the
present
grand
vizier
and
the
leader
of
the
party
of
progress
is
the
person
against
whom
this
storm
of
opposition
is
now
gathering
in
spite
of
all
efforts
the
ottoman
power
is
rapidly
wasting
away
the
life
of
the
orient
is
nerveless
and
effete
the
native
strength
of
the
race
has
died
out
and
all
attempts
to
resuscitate
it
by
the
adoption
of
european
institutions
produce
mere
galvanic
spasms
which
leave
it
more
exhausted
than
before
the
accounts
we
have
had
of
turkish
progress
are
for
the
most
part
mere
delusions
the
sultan
is
a
but
weak
man
and
tyrannical
through
his
very
weakness
had
he
strength
enough
to
break
through
the
meshes
of
falsehood
and
venality
which
are
woven
so
close
about
him
he
might
accomplish
some
solid
good
but
turkish
rule
from
his
ministers
down
to
the
lowest
is
a
monstrous
system
of
deceit
and
corruption
these
people
have
not
the
most
remote
conception
of
the
true
aims
of
government
they
only
seek
to
enrich
themselves
and
their
parasites
at
the
expense
of
the
people
and
the
national
treasury
when
we
add
to
this
the
conscript
system
which
is
draining
the
provinces
of
their
best
moslem
subjects
to
the
advantage
of
the
christians
and
jews
and
the
blindness
of
the
revenue
laws
which
impose
on
domestic
manufactures
double
the
duty
levied
on
foreign
products
it
will
easily
be
foreseen
that
the
next
or
less
will
completely
drain
the
turkish
empire
of
its
last
lingering
energies
already
in
effect
turkey
exists
only
through
the
jealousy
of
the
european
nations
the
treaty
of
in
threw
her
into
the
hands
of
russia
although
the
influence
of
england
has
of
late
years
reigned
almost
exclusively
in
her
councils
these
are
the
two
powers
who
are
lowering
at
each
other
with
sleepless
eyes
in
the
dardanelles
and
the
bosphorus
the
people
and
most
probably
the
government
is
strongly
preposessed
in
favor
of
the
english
but
the
russian
bear
has
a
heavy
paw
and
when
he
puts
it
into
the
scale
all
other
weights
kick
the
beam
it
will
be
a
long
and
wary
struggle
and
no
man
can
prophecy
the
result
the
turks
are
a
people
easy
to
govern
were
even
the
imperfect
laws
now
in
existence
fairly
administered
they
would
thrive
and
improve
under
a
better
state
of
things
but
i
can
not
avoid
the
conviction
that
the
regeneration
of
the
east
will
never
be
effected
at
their
hands

lay
behind
us
so
we
speculated
no
more
on
the
exciting
topics
of
the
day
but
went
below
and
took
a
vapor
bath
in
our
berths
for
i
need
not
assure
you
that
the
nights
on
the
mediterranean
at
this
season
are
anything
but
chilly
and
here
i
must
note
the
fact
that
the
french
steamers
while
dearer
than
the
austrian
are
more
cramped
in
their
accommodations
and
filled
with
a
set
of
most
uncivil
servants
the
table
is
good
and
this
is
the
only
thing
to
be
commended
in
all
other
respects
i
prefer
the
lloyd
vessels
early
next
morning
we
passed
the
promontory
of
cyzicus
and
the
island
of
marmora
the
marble
quarries
of
which
give
name
to
the
sea
as
we
were
approaching
the
entrance
to
the
dardanelles
we
noticed
an
austrian
brig
drifting
in
the
current
the
whiff
of
her
flag
indicating
distress
her
rudder
was
entirely
gone
and
she
was
floating
helplessly
towards
the
thracian
coast
a
boat
was
immediately
lowered
and
a
hawser
carried
to
her
bows
by
which
we
towed
her
a
short
distance
but
our
steam
engine
did
not
like
this
drudgery
and
snapped
the
rope
repeatedly
so
that
at
last
we
were
obliged
to
leave
her
to
her
fate
the
lift
we
gave
however
had
its
effect
and
by
dexterous
maneuvering
with
the
sails
the
captain
brought
her
safely
into
the
harbor
of
gallipoli
where
she
dropped
anchor
beside
us
beyond
gallipoli
the
dardanelles
contract
and
the
opposing
continents
rise
into
lofty
and
barren
hills
in
point
of
natural
beauty
this
strait
is
greatly
inferior
to
the
bosphorus
it
lacks
the
streams
and
wooded
valleys
which
open
upon
the
latter
the
country
is
but
partially
cultivated
except
around
the
town
of
dardanelles
near
the
mouth
of
the
strait
the
site
of
the
bridge
of
xerxes
is
easily
recognized
the
conformation
of
the
different
shores
seconding
the
decision
of
antiquarians
here
too
are
sestos
and
abydos
of
passionate
and
poetic
memory
but
as
the
sun
dipped
towards
the
sea
we
passed
out
of
the
narrow
gateway
on
our
left
lay
the
plain
of
troy
backed
by
the
blue
range
of
mount
ida
the
tamulus
of
patroclus
crowned
a
low
bluff
looking
on
the
sea
on
the
right
appeared
the
long
irregular
island
of
imbros
and
the
peaks
of
misty
samothrace
over
and
beyond
it
tenedos
was
before
us
the
red
flush
of
sunset
tinged
the
grand
homeric
landscape
and
lingered
and
lingered
on
the
summit
of
ida
as
if
loth
to
depart
i
paced
the
deck
until
long
after
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
it
any
more
the
next
morning
we
dropped
anchor
in
the
harbor
of
smyrna
where
we
remained
five
hours
i
engaged
a
donkey
and
rode
out
to
the
caravan
bridge
where
the
greek
driver
and
i
smoked
narghilehs
and
drank
coffee
in
the
shade
of
the
acacias
i
contrasted
my
impressions
with
those
of
my
first
visit
to
smyrna
last
october
my
first
glimpse
of
oriental
ground
then
every
dog
barked
at
me
and
all
the
horde
of
human
creatures
who
prey
upon
innocent
travellers
ran
at
my
heels
but
now
with
my
brown
face
and
turkish
aspect
of
grave
indifference
i
was
suffered
to
pass
as
quietly
as
my
himself
nor
did
the
latter
nor
the
ready
who
filled
our
pipes
on
the
banks
of
the
meles
attempt
to
overcharge
me
a
sure
sign
that
the
orient
had
left
its
seal
on
my
face
returning
through
the
city
the
same
mishap
befel
me
which
travellers
usually
experience
on
their
first
arrival
my
donkey
while
dashing
at
full
speed
through
a
crowd
of
smyrniotes
in
their
sunday
dresses
slipped
up
in
a
little
pool
of
black
mud
and
came
down
with
a
crash
i
flew
over
his
head
and
alighted
firmly
on
my
feet
but
the
spruce
young
greeks
whose
snowy
fustanelles
were
terribly
bespattered
came
off
much
worse
the
donkey
shied
back
levelled
his
ears
and
twisted
his
head
on
one
side
awaiting
a
beating
but
his
bleeding
legs
saved
him
we
left
at
two
touched
at
scio
in
the
evening
and
the
next
morning
at
sunrise
in
the
harbor
of
syra
the
piræus
was
only
twelve
hours
distant
but
after
my
visitation
of
fever
in
constantinople
i
feared
to
encounter
the
pestilential
summer
heats
of
athens
besides
i
had
reasons
for
hastening
with
all
speed
to
italy
and
germany
at
ten
we
weighed
anchor
again
and
steered
southwards
between
the
groups
of
the
cyclades
under
a
cloudless
sky
and
over
a
sea
of
the
brightest
blue
the
days
were
endurable
under
the
canvas
awning
of
our
but
the
nights
in
our
berths
were
which
left
us
so
limp
and
exhausted
that
we
were
almost
fit
to
vanish
like
ghosts
at
daybreak
our
last
glimpse
of
the
morea
cape
matapan
faded
away
in
the
moonlight
and
for
days
we
travelled
westward
over
the
burning
sea
on
the
evening
of
the
the
long
low
outline
of
malta
rose
gradually
against
the
last
flush
of
sunset
and
in
two
hours
thereafter
we
came
to
anchor
in
quarantine
harbor
the
quarantine
for
travellers
returning
from
the
east
which
formerly
varied
from
fourteen
to
days
is
now
reduced
to
one
day
for
those
arriving
from
greece
or
turkey
and
three
days
for
those
from
egypt
and
syria
in
our
case
it
was
reduced
to
sixteen
hours
by
an
official
courtesy
i
had
intended
proceeding
directly
to
naples
but
by
the
contemptible
trickery
of
the
agents
of
the
french
steamers
a
long
history
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
recapitulate
am
left
here
to
wait
ten
days
for
another
steamer
it
is
enough
to
say
that
there
are
six
other
travellers
at
the
same
hotel
some
coming
from
constantinople
and
some
from
alexandria
in
the
same
predicament
because
a
single
ticket
to
naples
costs
some
thirty
or
forty
francs
less
than
by
dividing
the
trip
into
two
parts
the
agents
in
those
cities
refuse
to
give
tickets
further
than
malta
to
those
who
are
not
keen
enough
to
see
through
the
deception
i
made
every
effort
to
obtain
a
second
ticket
in
time
to
leave
by
the
branch
steamer
for
italy
but
in
vain
la
valetta
is
to
my
eyes
the
most
beautiful
small
city
in
the
world
it
is
a
jewel
of
a
place
not
a
street
but
is
full
of
picturesque
effects
and
all
the
which
you
catch
at
every
turn
let
your
eyes
rest
either
upon
one
of
the
beautiful
harbors
on
each
side
or
the
distant
horizon
of
the
sea
the
streets
are
so
clean
that
you
might
eat
your
dinner
off
the
pavement
the
white
balconies
and
cornices
of
the
houses
all
cleanly
cut
in
the
soft
maltese
stone
stand
out
in
intense
relief
against
the
sky
and
from
the
manifold
reflections
and
counter
reflections
the
shadows
where
there
are
any
become
a
sort
of
milder
light
the
steep
sides
of
the
promontory
on
which
the
city
is
built
are
turned
into
staircases
and
it
is
an
inexhaustible
pastime
to
watch
the
groups
composed
of
all
nations
who
inhabit
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
ascending
and
descending
the
auberges
of
the
old
knights
the
palace
of
the
grand
master
the
church
of
john
and
other
relics
of
past
time
but
more
especially
the
fortifications
invest
the
place
with
a
romantic
interest
and
i
suspect
that
after
venice
and
granada
there
are
few
cities
where
the
middle
ages
have
left
more
impressive
traces
of
their
history
the
maltese
are
contented
and
appear
to
thrive
under
the
english
administration
they
are
a
peculiar
people
reminding
me
of
the
arab
even
more
than
the
italian
while
a
certain
rudeness
in
their
build
and
motions
suggests
their
punic
ancestry
their
language
is
a
curious
compound
of
arabic
and
italian
the
former
being
the
basis
i
find
that
i
can
understand
more
than
half
that
is
said
the
arabic
terminations
being
applied
to
italian
words
i
believe
it
has
never
been
successfully
reduced
to
writing
and
the
restoration
of
pure
arabic
has
been
proposed
with
much
reason
as
preferable
to
an
attempt
to
improve
or
refine
it
italian
is
the
language
used
in
the
courts
of
justice
and
polite
society
and
is
spoken
here
with
much
more
purity
than
either
in
naples
or
sicily
the
heat
has
been
so
great
since
i
landed
that
i
have
not
ventured
outside
of
the
city
except
last
evening
to
an
amateur
theatre
got
up
by
the
officers
and
privates
in
the
garrison
the
performances
were
quite
tolerable
except
a
young
damsel
who
spoke
with
a
rough
masculine
voice
and
made
long
strides
across
the
stage
when
she
rushed
into
her
lover
arms
i
am
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
exhausting
character
of
the
heat
the
thermometer
shows
by
day
and
to
by
night
a
much
lower
temperature
than
i
have
found
quite
comfortable
in
africa
and
syria
in
the
desert
in
the
shade
is
rather
bracing
than
otherwise
here
renders
all
exercise
more
severe
than
smoking
a
pipe
impossible
even
in
a
state
of
complete
inertia
a
will
fall
starchless
in
five
minutes
rather
than
waste
eight
more
days
in
this
glimmering
i
have
taken
passage
in
a
maltese
which
sails
this
evening
for
catania
in
sicily
where
the
grand
festival
of
agatha
which
takes
place
once
in
a
hundred
years
will
be
celebrated
next
week
the
trip
promises
a
new
experience
and
i
shall
get
a
taste
slight
though
it
be
of
the
golden
trinacria
of
the
ancients
perhaps
after
all
this
delay
which
so
vexes
me
bear
in
mind
i
am
no
longer
in
the
orient
may
be
meant
solely
for
my
good
at
least
winthrop
our
consul
here
who
has
been
exceedingly
kind
and
courteous
to
me
thinks
it
a
rare
good
fortune
that
i
shall
see
the
catanian
festa
chapter
xxx
the
festival
of
agatha
departure
from
malta
the
speronara
our
the
first
night
on
board
sicily
scarcity
of
provisions
beating
in
the
calabrian
channel
the
fourth

the

the

the
morn
is
full
of
holiday
loud
bells
with
rival

ring
from
every
spire
music
dies
and
swells
in
echoing
places
when
the
winds
respire
light
flags
stream
out
like
gauzy
tongues
of
keats
catania
sicily
i
went
on
board
the
in
the
harbor
of
la
valetta
at
the
appointed
hour
and
found
the
remaining
sixteen
passengers
already
embarked
the
captain
made
his
appearance
an
hour
later
with
our
bill
of
health
and
passports
and
as
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
brown
hills
of
the
island
we
passed
the
rocks
of
the
promontory
dividing
the
two
harbors
and
slowly
moved
off
towards
sicily
the
maltese
resembles
the
ancient
roman
galley
more
than
any
modern
craft
it
has
the
same
high
curved
poop
and
stern
the
same
short
masts
and
broad
square
sails
the
hull
is
too
broad
for
speed
but
this
adds
to
the
security
of
the
vessel
in
a
gale
with
a
fair
wind
it
rarely
makes
more
than
eight
knots
an
hour
and
in
a
calm
the
sailors
if
not
too
lazy
propel
it
forward
with
six
long
oars
the
hull
is
painted
in
a
fanciful
style
generally
blue
red
green
and
white
with
bright
red
masts
the
bulwarks
are
low
and
the
deck
of
such
a
convexity
that
it
is
quite
impossible
to
walk
it
in
a
heavy
sea
such
was
the
vessel
to
which
i
found
myself
consigned
it
was
not
more
than
fifty
feet
long
and
of
less
capacity
than
a
nile
there
was
a
sort
of
deck
cabin
or
crib
with
two
berths
but
most
of
the
passengers
slept
in
the
hold
for
a
passage
to
catania
i
was
obliged
to
pay
forty
francs
the
owner
swearing
that
this
was
the
regular
price
but
as
i
afterwards
discovered
the
maltese
only
paid
francs
for
the
whole
trip
however
the
captain
tried
to
make
up
the
money
worth
in
civilities
and
was
incessant
in
his
attentions
to
your
lordships
as
he
styled
myself
and
my
companion
cæsar
di
cagnola
a
young
milanese
the
maltese
were
tailors
and
clerks
who
were
taking
a
holiday
trip
to
witness
the
great
festival
of
agatha
with
two
exceptions
they
were
a
wild
and
senseless
though
set
and
in
spite
of
which
exercised
them
terribly
for
the
first
two
days
kept
up
a
constant
jabber
in
their
bastard
arabic
from
morning
till
night
as
is
usual
in
such
a
company
one
of
them
was
obliged
to
serve
as
a
butt
for
the
rest
and
maestro
paolo
as
they
termed
him
wore
such
a
profoundly
serious
face
all
the
while
from
his
that
the
fun
never
came
to
an
end
as
they
were
going
to
a
religious
festival
some
of
them
had
brought
their
breviaries
along
with
them
but
i
am
obliged
to
testify
that
after
the
first
day
prayers
were
totally
forgotten
the
sailors
however
wore
linen
bags
printed
with
a
figure
of
the
madonna
around
their
necks
the
sea
was
rather
rough
but
cæsar
and
i
fortified
our
stomachs
with
a
bottle
of
english
ale
and
as
it
was
dark
by
this
time
sought
our
for
the
night
as
we
had
paid
double
were
assured
us
in
the
coop
on
deck
but
beds
were
not
included
in
the
bargain
the
maltese
who
had
brought
mattresses
and
spread
a
large
phalansteriau
bed
in
the
hold
fared
much
better
i
took
one
of
my
carpet
bags
for
a
pillow
and
lay
down
on
the
planks
where
i
succeeded
in
getting
a
little
sleep
between
the
groans
of
the
helpless
we
had
the
or
all
night
but
the
speronara
moved
sluggishly
and
in
the
morning
it
changed
to
the
or
no
land
was
in
sight
but
towards
noon
the
sky
became
clearer
and
we
saw
the
southern
coast
of
sicily
a
bold
looming
in
the
distance
cape
passaro
was
to
the
east
and
the
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
in
beating
up
to
it
at
sunset
we
were
near
enough
to
see
the
villages
and
of
the
beautiful
shore
and
far
behind
the
nearer
mountains
ninety
miles
distant
the
solitary
cone
of
etna
the
second
night
passed
like
the
first
except
that
our
bruised
limbs
were
rather
more
sensitive
to
the
texture
of
the
planks
we
crawled
out
of
our
coop
at
dawn
expecting
to
behold
catania
in
the
distance
but
there
was
cape
passaro
still
staring
us
in
the
face
the
maltese
were
patient
and
we
did
not
complain
though
cæsar
and
i
began
to
make
nice
calculations
as
to
the
probable
duration
of
our
two
cold
fowls
and
three
loaves
of
bread
the
promontory
of
syracuse
was
barely
visible
forty
miles
ahead
but
the
wind
was
against
us
and
so
another
day
passed
in
beating
up
the
eastern
coast
at
dusk
we
overtook
another
speronara
which
had
left
malta
two
hours
before
us
and
this
was
quite
a
triumph
to
our
captain
all
the
oars
were
shipped
the
sailors
and
some
of
the
more
courageous
passengers
took
hold
and
we
shot
ahead
scudding
rapidly
along
the
dark
shores
to
the
sound
of
the
wild
maltese
songs
at
length
the
promontory
was
gained
and
the
restless
current
rolling
down
from
scylla
and
charybdis
tossed
our
little
bark
from
wave
to
wave
with
a
recklessness
that
would
have
made
any
one
nervous
but
an
old
sailor
like
myself
morning
said
the
captain
we
shall
sail
into
catania
but
after
a
third
night
on
the
planks
which
were
now
a
little
softer
we
rose
to
find
ourselves
abreast
of
syracuse
with
etna
as
distant
as
ever
the
wind
was
light
and
what
little
we
made
by
tacking
was
swept
away
by
the
current
so
that
after
wasting
the
whole
forenoon
we
kept
a
straight
course
across
the
mouth
of
the
channel
and
at
sunset
saw
the
calabrian
mountains
this
move
only
lost
us
more
ground
as
it
happened
cæsar
and
i
mournfully
and
silently
consumed
our
last
fragment
of
beef
with
the
remaining
dry
crusts
of
bread
and
then
sat
down
doggedly
to
smoke
and
see
whether
the
captain
would
discover
our
situation
but
no
while
we
were
supplied
the
whole
vessel
was
at
our
lordships
command
and
now
that
we
were
destitute
he
took
care
to
make
no
rash
offers
cæsar
at
last
with
an
imperial
dignity
becoming
his
name
commanded
dinner
it
came
and
the
pork
and
maccaroni
moistened
with
red
sicilian
wine
gave
us
patience
for
another
day
the
fourth
morning
dawned
and
great
neptune
be
praised
we
were
actually
within
the
gulf
of
catania
etna
loomed
up
in
all
his
sublime
bulk
unobscured
by
cloud
or
mist
while
a
slender
jet
of
smoke
rising
from
his
crater
was
slowly
curling
its
wreaths
in
the
clear
air
as
if
happy
to
receive
the
first
beam
of
the
sun
the
towers
of
syracuse
which
had
mocked
us
all
the
preceding
day
were
no
longer
visible
the
little
port
of
augusta
lay
behind
us
and
as
the
wind
continued
favorable
ere
long
we
saw
a
faint
white
mark
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
this
was
catania
the
shores
of
the
bay
were
enlivened
with
and
the
gleam
of
the
villages
while
here
and
there
a
single
palm
dreamed
of
its
brothers
across
the
sea
etna
of
course
had
the
monarch
place
in
the
landscape
but
even
his
large
magnificent
outlines
could
not
usurp
all
my
feeling
the
purple
peaks
to
the
westward
and
farther
inland
had
a
beauty
of
their
own
and
in
the
gentle
curves
with
which
they
leaned
towards
each
other
there
was
a
promise
of
the
flowery
meadows
of
enna
the
smooth
blue
water
was
speckled
with
we
hailed
one
inquiring
when
the
was
to
commence
but
mistaking
our
question
they
answered
anchovies
thereupon
a
waggish
maltese
informed
them
that
maestro
paolo
thanked
them
heartily
all
the
other
boats
were
hailed
in
the
name
of
maestro
paolo
who
having
recovered
from
his
took
his
bantering
catania
presented
a
lovely
picture
as
we
drew
near
the
harbor
planted
at
the
very
foot
of
etna
it
has
a
background
such
as
neither
naples
nor
genoa
can
boast
the
hills
next
the
sea
are
covered
with
gardens
and
orchards
sprinkled
with
little
villages
and
the
country
palaces
of
the
nobles
a
rich
cultured
landscape
which
gradually
merges
into
the
forests
of
oak
and
chestnut
that
girdle
the
waist
of
the
great
volcano
but
all
the
wealth
of
southern
vegetation
can
not
hide
the
footsteps
of
that
ruin
which
from
time
to
time
visits
the
soil
up
the
is
dotted
with
cones
of
ashes
and
cinders
some
covered
with
the
scanty
shrubbery
which
centuries
have
called
forth
some
barren
and
recent
while
two
dark
winding
streams
of
sterile
lava
descend
to
the
very
shore
where
they
stand
congealed
in
ragged
needles
and
pyramids
part
of
one
of
these
black
floods
has
swept
the
town
and
tumbling
into
the
sea
walls
one
side
of
the
port
we
glided
slowly
past
the
mole
and
dropped
anchor
a
few
yards
from
the
shore
there
was
a
sort
of
open
promenade
planted
with
trees
in
front
of
us
surrounded
with
high
white
houses
above
which
rose
the
dome
of
the
cathedral
and
the
spires
of
other
churches
the
magnificent
palace
of
prince
biscari
was
on
our
right
and
at
its
foot
the
customs
and
revenue
offices
every
roof
portico
and
window
was
lined
with
lamps
a
triumphal
arch
spanned
the
street
before
the
palace
and
the
at
the
offices
was
festooned
with
crimson
and
white
drapery
spangled
with
gold
while
we
were
waiting
permission
to
land
a
scene
presented
itself
which
recalled
the
pagan
days
of
sicily
to
my
mind
a
procession
came
in
sight
from
under
the
trees
and
passed
along
the
shore
in
the
centre
was
borne
a
stately
shrine
hung
with
garlands
and
containing
an
image
of
agatha
the
sound
of
flutes
and
cymbals
accompanied
it
and
a
band
of
children
bearing
orange
and
palm
branches
danced
riotously
before
had
the
image
been
pan
instead
of
agatha
the
ceremonies
would
have
been
quite
as
appropriate
the
speronara
boat
at
last
took
us
to
the
gorgeous
landing
place
where
we
were
carefully
counted
by
a
fat
sicilian
official
and
declared
free
from
quarantine
we
were
then
called
into
the
passport
office
where
the
maltese
underwent
a
searching
examination
one
of
the
officers
sat
with
the
black
book
or
list
of
suspected
persons
of
all
nations
open
before
him
and
looked
for
each
name
as
it
was
called
out
another
scanned
the
faces
of
the
frightened
tailors
as
if
comparing
them
with
certain
revolutionary
visages
in
his
mind
terrible
was
the
keen
detective
glance
of
his
eye
and
it
went
straight
through
the
poor
maltese
who
vanished
with
great
rapidity
when
they
were
declared
free
to
enter
the
city
at
last
they
all
passed
the
ordeal
but
cæsar
and
i
remained
looking
in
at
the
door
there
are
still
these
two
frenchmen
said
the
captain
i
am
no
frenchman
i
protested
i
am
an
american
and
i
said
cæsar
am
an
austrian
subject
thereupon
we
received
a
polite
invitation
to
enter
the
terrible
glance
softened
into
a
benign
respectful
smile
he
of
the
black
book
ran
lightly
over
the
c
and
t
and
said
with
a
courteous
inclination
there
is
nothing
against
the
signori
i
felt
quite
relieved
by
this
for
in
the
mediterranean
one
is
never
safe
from
spies
and
no
person
is
too
insignificant
to
escape
the
ban
if
once
suspected
calabria
was
filled
to
overflowing
with
strangers
from
all
parts
of
the
two
sicilies
and
we
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
very
bad
and
dear
lodgings
it
was
the
first
day
of
the
and
the
streets
were
filled
with
peasants
the
men
in
black
velvet
jackets
and
breeches
with
stockings
and
long
white
cotton
caps
hanging
on
the
shoulders
and
the
women
with
gay
silk
shawls
on
their
heads
after
the
manner
of
the
mexican
in
all
the
public
squares
the
market
scene
in
masaniello
was
acted
to
the
life
the
sicilian
dialect
is
harsh
and
barbarous
and
the
original
italian
is
so
disguised
by
the
admixture
of
arabic
spanish
french
and
greek
words
that
even
my
imperial
friend
who
was
a
born
italian
had
great
difficulty
in
understanding
the
people
i
purchased
a
guide
to
the
festa
which
among
other
things
contained
a
biography
of
agatha
it
is
a
beautiful
specimen
of
pious
writing
and
i
regret
that
i
have
not
space
to
translate
the
whole
of
it
agatha
was
a
beautiful
catanian
virgin
who
secretly
embraced
christianity
during
the
reign
of
nero
catania
was
then
governed
by
a
prætor
named
quintianus
who
becoming
enamored
of
agatha
used
the
most
brutal
means
to
compel
her
to
submit
to
his
desires
but
without
effect
at
last
driven
to
the
cruelest
extremes
he
cut
off
her
breasts
and
threw
her
into
prison
but
at
midnight
peter
accompanied
by
an
angel
appeared
to
her
restored
the
maimed
parts
and
left
her
more
beautiful
than
ever
quintianus
then
ordered
a
furnace
to
be
heated
and
cast
her
therein
a
terrible
earthquake
shook
the
city
the
sun
was
eclipsed
the
sea
rolled
backwards
and
left
its
bottom
dry
the
prætor
palace
fell
in
ruins
and
he
pursued
by
the
vengeance
of
the
populace
fled
till
he
reached
the
river
simeto
where
he
was
drowned
in
attempting
to
cross
the
thunders
of
the
vengeance
of
god
says
the
biography
struck
him
down
into
the
profoundest
hell
this
was
in
the
year
the
body
was
carried
to
constantinople
in
although
the
catanians
wept
incessantly
at
their
loss
but
in
two
french
knights
named
gilisbert
and
goselin
were
moved
by
angelic
influences
to
restore
it
to
its
native
town
which
they
accomplished
and
the
eyes
of
the
catanians
again
burned
with
joy
the
miracles
effected
by
the
saint
are
numberless
and
her
power
is
especially
efficacious
in
preventing
earthquakes
and
eruptions
of
mount
etna
nevertheless
catania
has
suffered
more
from
these
causes
than
any
other
town
in
sicily
but
i
would
that
all
saints
had
as
good
a
claim
to
canonization
as
agatha
the
honors
of
such
a
festival
as
this
are
not
out
of
place
when
paid
to
such
youth
beauty
and
heavenly
chastity
as
she
typifies
the
guide
which
i
have
already
consulted
gives
a
full
account
of
the
festa
in
advance
with
a
description
of
catania
the
author
says
if
thy
heart
is
not
inspired
by
gazing
on
this
lovely
city
it
is
a
fatal
sign
thou
wert
not
born
to
feel
the
sweet
impulses
of
the
beautiful
then
in
announcing
the
illuminations
and
pyrotechnic
displays
he
exclaims
oh
the
amazing
spectacle
oh
how
happy
art
thou
that
thou
beholdest
it
i
what
pyramids
of
lamps
what
myriads
of
rockets
what
wonderful
temples
of
flame
the
mountain
himself
is
astonished
at
such
a
display
and
truly
except
the
illumination
of
the
golden
horn
on
the
night
of
predestination
i
have
seen
nothing
equal
to
the
spectacle
presented
by
catania
during
the
past
three
nights
the
city
which
has
been
built
up
from
her
ruins
more
stately
than
ever
was
in
a
blaze
of
light
all
her
domes
towers
and
the
long
lines
of
her
beautiful
palaces
revealed
in
the
varying
red
and
golden
flames
of
a
hundred
thousand
lamps
and
torches
pyramids
of
fire
transparencies
and
illuminated
triumphal
arches
filled
the
four
principal
streets
and
the
fountain
in
the
cathedral
square
gleamed
like
a
jet
of
molten
silver
spinning
up
from
one
of
the
pores
of
etna
at
ten
a
gorgeous
display
of
fireworks
closed
the
day
festivities
but
the
lamps
remained
burning
nearly
all
night
on
the
second
night
the
grand
procession
of
the
veil
took
place
i
witnessed
this
imposing
spectacle
from
the
balcony
of
prince
palace
long
lines
of
waxen
torches
led
the
way
followed
by
a
military
band
and
then
a
company
of
the
highest
prelates
in
their
most
brilliant
costumes
surrounding
the
bishop
who
walked
under
a
canopy
of
silk
and
gold
bearing
the
miraculous
veil
of
agatha
i
was
blessed
with
a
distant
view
of
it
but
could
see
no
traces
of
the
rosy
hue
left
upon
it
by
the
flames
of
the
saint
martyrdom
behind
the
priests
came
the
of
sicily
filangieri
the
same
who
three
years
ago
gave
up
catania
to
sack
and
slaughter
he
was
followed
by
the
senate
of
the
city
who
have
just
had
the
cringing
cowardice
to
offer
him
a
ball
on
next
sunday
night
if
ever
a
man
deserved
the
vengeance
of
an
outraged
people
it
is
this
filangieri
who
was
first
a
liberal
when
the
cause
promised
success
and
then
made
himself
the
scourge
of
the
vilest
of
kings
as
he
passed
me
last
night
in
his
carriage
of
state
while
the
music
pealed
in
rich
rejoicing
strains
that
solemn
chant
with
which
the
monks
break
upon
the
revellers
in
lucrezia
borgia
came
into
my
mind
la
gioja
del
profani
un
fumo
passagier
the
rejoicing
of
the
profane
is
a
transitory
mist
i
heard
under
the
din
of
all
these
festivities
the
voice
of
that
retribution
which
even
now
lies
in
wait
and
will
not
long
be
delayed
signor
scavo
the
american
took
me
to
the
palace
of
prince
biscari
overlooking
the
harbor
in
order
to
behold
the
grand
display
of
fireworks
from
the
end
of
the
mole
the
showers
of
rockets
and
colored
stars
and
the
temples
of
blue
and
silver
fire
were
repeated
in
the
dark
quiet
bosom
of
the
sea
producing
the
most
dazzling
and
startling
effects
there
was
a
large
number
of
the
catanese
nobility
present
and
among
them
a
marchesa
gioveni
the
descendant
of
the
bloody
house
of
anjou
prince
biscari
is
a
benign
courtly
old
man
and
greatly
esteemed
here
his
son
is
at
present
in
exile
on
account
of
the
part
he
took
in
the
late
revolution
during
the
sack
of
the
city
under
filangieri
the
palace
was
plundered
of
property
to
the
amount
of
ten
thousand
dollars
the
museum
of
greek
and
roman
antiquities
attached
to
it
and
which
the
house
of
biscari
has
been
collecting
for
many
years
is
probably
the
finest
in
sicily
the
state
apartments
were
thrown
open
this
evening
and
when
i
left
an
hour
ago
the
greater
portion
of
the
guests
were
going
through
mazy
quadrilles
on
the
mosaic
pavements
among
the
antiquities
of
catania
which
i
have
visited
are
the
amphitheatre
capable
of
holding
persons
the
old
greek
theatre
the
same
in
which
alcibiades
made
his
noted
harangue
to
the
catanians
the
odeon
and
the
ancient
baths
the
theatre
which
is
in
tolerable
preservation
is
built
of
lava
like
many
of
the
modern
edifices
in
the
city
the
baths
proved
to
me
what
i
had
supposed
that
the
oriental
bath
of
the
present
day
is
identical
with
that
of
the
ancients
why
so
admirable
an
institution
has
never
been
introduced
into
europe
except
in
the
of
paris
is
more
than
i
can
tell
from
the
pavement
of
these
baths
which
is
nearly
twenty
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
lava
of
later
eruptions
has
burst
up
in
places
in
hard
black
jets
the
most
wonderful
token
of
that
flood
which
whelmed
catania
two
hundred
years
ago
is
to
be
seen
at
the
grand
benedictine
convent
of
san
nicola
in
the
upper
part
of
the
city
here
the
stream
of
lava
divides
itself
just
before
the
convent
and
flows
past
on
both
sides
leaving
the
building
and
gardens
untouched
the
marble
courts
the
fountains
the
splendid
galleries
and
the
gardens
of
richest
southern
bloom
and
fragrance
stand
like
an
epicurean
island
in
the
midst
of
the
terrible
stony
waves
whose
edges
bristle
with
the
thorny
aloe
and
cactus
the
monks
of
san
nicola
are
all
chosen
from
the
sicilian
nobility
and
live
a
comfortable
life
of
luxury
and
vice
each
one
has
his
own
carriage
horses
and
servants
and
each
his
private
chambers
outside
of
the
convent
walls
and
his
kept
concubines
these
facts
are
known
and
acknowledged
by
the
catanians
to
whom
they
are
a
lasting
scandal
it
is
past
midnight
and
i
must
close

this

would

but
my
only
chance
of
reaching
messina
in
time
for
the
next

to

is
the
diligence
which
leaves
here
the
mountain
has
been
covered
with
clouds
for
the
last
two
days
and
i
have
had
no
view
at
all
comparable
to
that
of
the
morning
of
my
arrival
the
grand
procession
of
the
body
of
agatha
takes
place
but
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
three
days
of

centennial
festival
of
the
only
saint
who
is
supposed
to
have
any
power
over
him
it
shows
a
disregard
of
female
influence
not
at
all
suited
to
the
present
day
and
i
scarcely
believe
that
he
seriously
means
it
next
came
along
the
jabbering
landlady
i
do
like
his
looks
it
was
just
so
the
last
time
come
excellenza
you
can
see
him
from
the
back
terrace
the
sun
was
not
yet
risen
but
the
east
was
bright
with
his
coming
and
there
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
all
the
features
of
etna
were
sharply
sculptured
in
the
clear
air
from
the
topmost
cone
a
thick
stream
of
white
smoke
was
slowly
puffed
out
at
short
intervals
and
rolled
lazily
down
the
eastern
side
it
had
a
heavy
languid
character
and
i
should
have
thought
nothing
of
the
appearance
but
for
the
alarm
of
my
hosts
it
was
like
the
slow
fire
of
earth
incense
burning
on
that
grand
mountain
altar
i
hurried
off
to
the
post
office
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
diligence
from
palermo
the
office
is
in
the
strada
etnea
the
main
street
of
catania
which
runs
straight
through
the
city
from
the
sea
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
whose
peak
closes
the
long
vista
the
diligence
was
an
hour
later
than
usual
and
i
passed
the
time
in
watching
the
smoke
which
continued
to
increase
in
volume
and
was
mingled
from
time
to
time
with
jets
of
inky
blackness
the
postilion
said
he
had
seen
fires
and
heard
loud
noises
during
the
night
according
to
his
account
the
disturbances
commenced
about
midnight
i
could
not
but
envy
my
friend
cæsar
who
was
probably
at
that
moment
on
the
summit
looking
down
into
the
seething
fires
of
the
crater
at
last
we
rolled
out
of
catania
there
were
in
the
diligence
besides
myself
two
men
and
a
woman
sicilians
of
the
secondary
class
the
road
followed
the
shore
over
rugged
tracts
of
lava
the
different
epochs
of
which
could
be
distinctly
traced
in
the
character
of
the
vegetation
the
last
great
flow
of
stood
piled
in
long
ridges
of
terrible
sterility
barely
allowing
the
aloe
and
cactus
to
take
root
in
the
hollows
between
the
older
deposits
were
sufficiently
decomposed
to
nourish
the
olive
and
vine
but
even
here
the
orchards
were
studded
with
pyramids
of
the
harder
fragments
which
are
laboriously
collected
by
the
husbandmen
in
the
few
favored
spots
which
have
been
untouched
for
so
many
ages
that
a
tolerable
depth
of
soil
has
accumulated
the
vegetation
has
all
the
richness
and
brilliancy
of
tropical
lands
the
palm
orange
and
pomegranate
thrive
luxuriantly
and
the
vines
almost
break
under
their
heavy
clusters
the
villages
are
frequent
and
well
built
and
the
hills
are
studded
far
and
near
with
the
villas
of
rich
proprietors
mostly
buildings
of
one
story
with
verandahs
extending
their
whole
length
looking
up
towards
etna
whose
base
the
road
encircles
the
views
are
gloriously
rich
and
beautiful
on
the
other
hand
is
the
blue
mediterranean
and
the
irregular
outline
of
the
shore
here
and
there
sending
forth
promontories
of
lava
cooled
by
the
waves
into
the
most
fantastic
forms
we
had
sot
proceeded
far
before
a
new
sign
called
my
attention
to
the
mountain
not
only
was
there
a
perceptible
jar
or
vibration
in
the
earth
but
a
dull
groaning
sound
like
the
muttering
of
distant
thunder
began
to
be
heard
the
smoke
increased
in
volume
and
as
we
advanced
further
to
the
eastward
and
much
nearer
to
the
great
cone
i
perceived
that
it
consisted
of
two
jets
issuing
from
different
mouths
a
broad
stream
of
very
dense
white
smoke
still
flowed
over
the
lip
of
the
topmost
crater
and
down
the
eastern
side
as
its
breadth
did
not
vary
and
the
edges
were
distinctly
defined
it
was
no
doubt
the
sulphureous
vapor
rising
from
a
river
of
molten
lava
perhaps
a
thousand
yards
below
a
much
stronger
column
of
mingled
black
and
white
smoke
gushed
up
in
regular
beats
or
pants
from
a
depression
in
the
mountain
side
between
two
small
extinct
cones
all
this
part
of
etna
was
scarred
with
deep
chasms
and
in
the
bottoms
of
those
nearest
the
opening
i
could
see
the
red
gleam
of
fire
the
air
was
perfectly
still
and
as
yet
there
was
no
cloud
in
the
sky
when
we
stopped
to
change
horses
at
the
town
of
aci
reale
i
first
felt
the
violence
of
the
tremor
and
the
awful
sternness
of
the
sound
the
smoke
by
this
time
seemed
to
be
gathering
on
the
side
towards
catania
and
hung
in
a
dark
mass
about
down
the
mountain
groups
of
the
villagers
were
gathered
in
the
streets
which
looked
upwards
to
etna
and
discussing
the
chances
of
an
eruption
ah
said
an
old
peasant
the
mountain
knows
how
to
make
himself
respected
when
he
talks
everybody
listens
the
sound
was
the
most
awful
that
ever
met
my
ears
it
was
a
hard
painful
moan
now
and
then
fluttering
like
a
suppressed
sob
and
had
at
the
same
time
an
expression
of
threatening
and
of
agony
it
did
not
come
from
etna
alone
it
had
no
fixed
location
it
pervaded
all
space
it
was
in
the
air
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
in
the
earth
under
my
feet
everywhere
in
fact
and
as
it
continued
to
increase
in
violence
i
experienced
a
sensation
of
positive
pain
the
people
looked
anxious
and
alarmed
although
they
said
it
was
a
good
thing
for
all
sicily
that
last
year
they
had
been
in
constant
fear
from
earthquakes
and
that
an
eruption
invariably
left
the
island
quiet
for
several
years
it
is
true
that
during
the
past
year
parts
of
sicily
and
calabria
have
been
visited
with
severe
shocks
occasioning
much
damage
to
property
a
merchant
of
this
city
informed
me
yesterday
that
his
whole
family
had
slept
for
two
months
in
the
vaults
of
his
warehouse
fearing
that
their
residence
might
be
shaken
down
in
the
night
as
we
rode
along
from
aci
reale
to
taormina
all
the
rattling
of
the
diligence
over
the
rough
road
could
not
drown
the
awful
noise
there
was
a
strong
smell
of
sulphur
in
the
air
and
the
thick
pants
of
smoke
from
the
lower
crater
continued
to
increase
in
strength
the
sun
was
fierce
and
hot
and
the
edges
of
the
sulphureous
clouds
shone
with
a
dazzling
whiteness
a
mounted
soldier
overtook
us
and
rode
beside
the
diligence
talking
with
the
postillion
he
had
been
up
to
the
mountain
and
was
taking
his
report
to
the
governor
of
the
district
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
continued
tremor
of
the
air
lulled
me
into
a
sort
of
doze
when
i
was
suddenly
aroused
by
a
cry
from
the
soldier
and
the
stopping
of
the
diligence
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
terrific
peal
of
sound
followed
by
a
jar
which
must
have
shaken
the
whole
island
we
looked
up
to
etna
which
was
fortunately
in
full
view
before
us
an
immense
mass
of
smoke
had
burst
up
from
the
crater
and
was
rising
perpendicularly
into
the
air
its
rounded
volumes
rapidly
whirling
one
over
the
other
yet
urged
with
such
impetus
that
they
only
rolled
outwards
after
they
had
ascended
to
an
immense
height
it
might
have
been
one
minute
or
five
for
i
was
so
entranced
by
this
wonderful
spectacle
that
i
lost
the
sense
of
time
but
it
seemed
instantaneous
so
rapid
and
violent
were
the
effects
of
the
explosion
when
there
stood
in
the
air
based
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
a
mass
of
smoke
four
or
five
miles
high
and
shaped
precisely
like
the
italian
pine
tree
words
can
not
paint
the
grandeur
of
this
mighty
tree
its
trunk
of
columned
smoke
one
side
of
which
was
silvered
by
the
sun
while
the
other
in
shadow
was
lurid
with
red
flame
rose
for
more
than
a
mile
before
it
sent
out
its
cloudy
boughs
then
parting
into
a
thousand
streams
each
of
which
again
threw
out
its
branching
tufts
of
smoke
rolling
and
waving
in
the
air
it
stood
in
intense
relief
against
the
dark
blue
of
the
sky
its
rounded
masses
of
foliage
were
dazzlingly
white
on
one
side
while
in
the
shadowy
depths
of
the
branches
there
was
a
constant
play
of
brown
yellow
and
crimson
tints
revealing
the
central
shaft
of
fire
it
was
like
the
tree
celebrated
in
the
scandinavian
sagas
as
seen
by
the
mother
of
harold
hardrada
that
tree
whose
roots
pierced
through
the
earth
whose
trunk
was
of
the
color
of
blood
and
whose
branches
filled
the
uttermost
corners
of
the
heavens
this
outburst
seemed
to
have
relieved
the
mountain
for
the
tremors
were
now
less
violent
though
the
terrible
noise
still
droned
in
the
air
and
earth
and
sea
and
now
from
the
base
of
the
tree
three
white
streams
slowly
crept
into
as
many
separate
chasms
against
the
walls
of
which
played
the
flickering
glow
of
the
burning
lava
the
column
of
smoke
and
flame
was
still
hurled
upwards
and
the
tree
after
standing
about
ten
minutes
a
new
and
awful
revelation
of
the
active
forces
of
nature
gradually
rose
and
spread
lost
its
form
and
slowly
moved
by
a
light
wind
the
first
that
disturbed
the
dead
calm
of
the
day
bent
over
to
the
eastward
we
resumed
our
course
the
vast
belt
of
smoke
at
last
arched
over
the
strait
here
about
twenty
miles
wide
and
sank
towards
the
distant
calabrian
shore
as
we
drove
under
it
for
some
miles
of
our
way
the
sun
was
totally
obscured
and
the
sky
presented
the
singular
spectacle
of
two
hemispheres
of
clear
blue
with
a
broad
belt
of
darkness
drawn
between
them
there
was
a
hot
sulphureous
vapor
in
the
air
and
showers
of
white
ashes
fell
from
time
to
time
we
were
distant
about
twelve
miles
in
a
straight
line
from
the
crater
but
the
air
was
so
clear
even
under
the
shadow
of
the
smoke
that
i
could
distinctly
trace
the
downward
movement
of
the
rivers
of
lava
this
was
the
eruption
at
last
to
which
all
the
phenomena
of
the
morning
had
been
only
preparatory
for
the
first
time
in
ten
years
the
depths
of
etna
had
been
stirred
and
i
thanked
god
for
my
detention
at
malta
and
the
singular
hazard
of
travel
which
had
brought
me
here
to
his
very
base
to
witness
a
scene
the
impression
of
which
i
shall
never
lose
to
my
dying
day
although
the
eruption
may
continue
and
the
mountain
pour
forth
fiercer
fires
and
broader
tides
of
lava
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
first
upheaval
which
lets
out
the
forces
will
not
be
equalled
in
grandeur
by
any
later
spectacle
after
passing
taormina
our
road
led
us
under
the
hills
of
the
coast
and
although
i
occasionally
caught
glimpses
of
etna
and
saw
the
reflection
of
fires
from
the
lava
which
was
filling
up
his
savage
ravines
the
smoke
at
last
encircled
his
waist
and
he
was
then
shut
out
of
sight
by
the
intervening
mountains
we
lost
a
bolt
in
a
deep
valley
opening
on
the
sea
and
during
our
stoppage
i
could
still
hear
the
groans
of
the
mountain
though
farther
off
and
less
painful
to
the
ear
as
evening
came
on
the
beautiful
hills
of
calabria
with
white
towns
and
villages
on
their
sides
gleamed
in
the
purple
light
of
the
setting
sun
we
drove
around
headland
after
headland
till
the
strait
opened
and
we
looked
over
the
harbor
of
messina
to
capo
faro
and
the
distant
islands
of
the
tyrrhene
sea
i
leave
this
afternoon
for
naples
and
leghorn
i
have
lost
already
so
much
time
between
constantinople
and
this
place
that
i
can
not
give
up
ten
days
more
to
etna
besides
i
am
so
thoroughly
satisfied
with
what
i
have
seen
that
i
fear
no
second
view
of
the
eruption
could
equal
it
etna
can
not
be
seen
from
here
nor
from
a
nearer
point
than
a
mountain
six
or
eight
miles
distant
i
tried
last
evening
to
get
a
horse
and
ride
out
to
it
in
order
to
see
the
appearance
of
the
eruption
by
night
but
every
horse
mule
and
donkey
in
the
place
was
engaged
except
a
miserable
lame
mule
for
which
five
dollars
was
demanded
however
the
night
happened
to
be
cloudy
so
that
i
could
have
seen
nothing
my
passport
is
finally
it
has
cost
the
labors
of
myself
and
an
since
yesterday
morning
and
the
expenditure
of
five
dollars
and
a
half
to
accomplish
this
great
work
i
have
just
been
righteously
abusing
the
neapolitan
government
to
a
native
merchant
whom
from
his
name
i
took
to
be
a
frenchman
but
as
i
am
off
in
an
hour
or
two
hope
to
escape
arrest
perdition
to
all
tyranny

i
lost

indian

in

i
saw

the

guttural
masculine

which
they
have
left
behind
them
i
now
design
following
their
footsteps
through
the
beautiful
which
to
the
eye
of
the
melek
was
only
less
lovely
than
the
plains
of
damascus
while
in
constantinople
i
received
letters
which
opened
to
me
wider
and
richer
fields
of
travel
than
i
had
already
traversed
i
saw
a
possibility
of
exploring
the
far
indian
realms
the
shores
of
farthest
cathay
and
the
famed
zipango
of
marco
polo
before
entering
on
this
new
sphere
of
experiences
however
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
visit
italy
germany
and
england
i
sailed
from
messina
to
leghorn
and
travelled
thence
by
way
of
florence
venice
and
the
tyrol
to
munich
after
three
happy
weeks
at
gotha
and
among
the
valleys
of
she
thüringian
forest
i
went
to
london
where
business
and
the
preparation
for
my
new
journeys
detained
me
two
or
three
weeks
longer
although
the
comforts
of
european
civilization
were
pleasant
as
a
change
after
the
wild
life
of
the
orient
the
autumnal
rains
of
england
soon
made
me
homesick
for
the
sunshine
i
had
left
the
weather
was
cold
dark
and
dreary
and
the
oppressive
sticky
atmosphere
of
the
bituminous
metropolis
weighed
upon
me
like
a
nightmare
heartily
tired
of
looking
at
a
sun
that
could
show
nothing
brighter
than
a
red
copper
disk
and
of
breathing
an
air
that
peppered
my
face
with
particles
of
soot
i
left
on
the
of
october
it
was
one
of
the
dismalest
days
of
autumn
the
meadows
of
berkshire
were
flooded
with
broad
muddy
streams
and
the
woods
on
the
hills
of
hampshire
looked
brown
and
sodden
as
if
slowly
rotting
away
i
reached
southampton
at
dusk
but
there
the
sky
was
neither
warmer
nor
clearer
so
i
spent
the
evening
over
a
coal
fire
all
impatience
for
the
bright
beloved
south
towards
which
my
face
was
turned
once
more
the
left
on
the
next
day
at
in
the
midst
of
a
cheerless
rain
which
half
blotted
out
the
pleasant
shores
of
southampton
water
and
the
isle
of
wight
the
was
a
singularly
appropriate
vessel
for
one
bound
on
such
a
journey
as
mine
the
surgeon
was
mungo
park
and
one
of
my
was
crusoe
it
was
a
friday
which
boded
no
good
for
the
voyage
but
then
my
journey
commenced
with
my
leaving
london
the
day
previous
and
thursday
is
a
lucky
day
among
the
arabs
i
caught
a
watery
view
of
the
gray
cliffs
of
the
needles
when
dinner
was
announced
but
many
were
those
and
i
among
them
who
commenced
that
meal
and
did
not
stay
to
finish
it
is
there
any
piece
of
water
more
unreasonably
distressingly
disgustingly
rough
and
perverse
than
the
british
channel
yes
there
is
one
and
but
one
the
bay
of
biscay
and
as
the
latter
succeeds
the
former
without
a
pause
between
and
the
never
ceased
and
the
rain
continually
poured
i
leave
you
to
draw
the
climax
of
my
misery
four
days
and
four
nights
in
a
berth
lying
on
your
back
now
dozing
dull
hour
after
hour
now
making
faint
endeavors
to
eat
or
reading
the
feeblest
novel
ever
written
because
the
mind
can
not
digest
stronger
aliment
can
there
be
a
greater
contrast
to
the
life
the
fiery
inspiration
of
the
orient
my
blood
became
so
sluggish
and
my
mind
so
cloudy
and
befogged
that
i
despaired
of
ever
thinking
clearly
or
feeling
vividly
again
the
winds
are
rude
in
biscay
byron
says
they
are
indeed
very
rude
they
must
have
been
raised
in
some
most
disorderly
quarter
of
the
globe
they
pitched
the
waves
right
over
our
bulwarks
and
now
and
then
dashed
a
bucketful
of
water
down
the
cabin
skylight
swamping
the
ladies
cabin
and
setting
scores
of
bandboxes
afloat
not
that
there
was
the
least
actual
danger
but
would
not
be
persuaded
that
we
were
not
on
the
brink
of
destruction
and
wrote
to
friends
at
home
a
voluminous
account
of
her
feelings
there
was
an
irishman
on
board
bound
to
italy
with
his
sister
it
was
his
first
tour
and
when
asked
why
he
did
not
go
direct
through
france
he
replied
with
brotherly
concern
that
he
was
anxious
his
sister
should
see
the
bay
of
biscay
this
youth
perceptions
were
of
such
an
emerald
hue
that
a
lot
of
wicked
englishmen
had
their
own
fun
out
of
him
the
other
day
he
was
trying
to
shave
to
the
great
danger
of
slicing
off
his
nose
as
the
vessel
was
rolling
fearfully
why
do
you
have
the
ship
headed
to
the
wind
said
one
of
the
englishmen
who
heard
his
complaints
she
will
then
lie
steady
and
you
can
shave
beautifully
thereupon
the
irishman
sent
one
of
the
stewards
upon
deck
with
a
polite
message
to
the
captain
begging
him
to
put
the
vessel
about
for
five
minutes
towards
noon
of
the
fifth
day
we
saw
the
dark
rugged
mountains
that
guard
the
corner
of
the
spanish
peninsula
we
passed
the
bay
of
corunna
and
rounding
the
bold
headland
of
finisterre
left
the
biscayan
billows
behind
us
but
the
sea
was
still
rough
and
the
sky
clouded
although
the
next
morning
the
mildness
of
the
air
showed
the
change
in
our
latitude
about
noon
that
day
we
made
the
burlings
a
cluster
of
rocks
forty
miles
north
of
lisbon
and
just
before
sunset
a
transient
lifting
of
the
clouds
revealed
the
rock
of
cintra
at
the
mouth
of
the
tagus
the
tall
perpendicular
cliffs
and
the
mountain
slopes
behind
covered
with
gardens
orchards
and
scattered
villas
and
hamlets
made
a
grand
though
dim
picture
which
was
soon
hidden
from
our
view
on
the
we
were
nearly
all
day
crossing
the
mouth
of
the
bay
of
cadiz
and
only
at
sunset
saw
cape
trafalgar
afar
off
glimmering
through
the
reddish
haze
i
remained
on
deck
as
there
were
patches
of
starlight
in
the
sky
after
passing
the
at
tarifa
the
spanish
shore
continued
to
be
visible
in
another
hour
there
was
a
dim
cloudy
outline
high
above
the
horizon
on
our
right
this
was
the
lesser
atlas
in
morocco
and
now
right
ahead
distinctly
visible
though
fifteen
miles
distant
lay
a
colossal
lion
with
his
head
on
his
outstretched
paws
looking
towards
africa
if
i
had
been
brought
to
the
spot
blindfolded
i
should
have
known
what
it
was
the
resemblance
is
certainly
very
striking
and
the
on
europa
point
seemed
to
be
a
lamp
held
in
his
paws
the
lights
of
the
city
and
fortifications
rose
one
by
one
glittering
along
the
base
and
at
midnight
we
dropped
anchor
before
them
on
the
western
side
i
landed
yesterday
morning
the
mists
which
had
followed
me
from
england
had
collected
behind
the
rock
and
the
sun
still
hidden
by
its
huge
bulk
shone
upwards
through
them
making
a
luminous
background
against
which
the
lofty
walls
and
jagged
ramparts
of
this
tremendous
natural
fortification
were
clearly
defined
i
announced
my
name
and
the
length
of
time
i
designed
remaining
at
a
little
office
on
the
quay
and
was
then
allowed
to
pass
into
the
city
a
number
of
familiar
white
turbans
met
me
on
entering
and
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
cordially
saluting
the
owners
in
their
own
language
the
town
is
long
and
narrow
lying
steeply
against
the
rock
the
houses
are
white
yellow
and
pink
as
in
spanish
towns
but
the
streets
are
clean
and
well
paved
there
is
a
square
about
the
size
of
an
ordinary
where
a
sort
of
market
of
dry
goods
and
small
articles
is
held
the
hotel
occupies
one
side
of
it
and
as
i
look
out
of
my
window
upon
it
i
see
the
topmost
cliffs
of
the
rock
above
me
threatening
to
topple
down
from
a
height
of
feet
my
first
walk
in
gibraltar
was
in
search
of
a
after
threading
the
whole
length
of
the
town
i
found
two
small
ones
in
a
garden
in
the
bottom
of
the
old
moat
the
sun
was
shining
and
his
rays
seemed
to
fall
with
double
warmth
on
their
feathery
crests
three
brown
spaniards
were
drawing
water
with
a
pole
and
bucket
and
filling
the
little
channels
which
conveyed
it
to
the
distant
vegetables
the
sea
glittered
blue
below
an
indian
shaded
me
but
on
the
rock
behind
an
aloe
lifted
its
blossoming
stem
some
twenty
feet
high
into
the
sunshine
to
describe
what
a
weight
was
lifted
from
my
heart
would
seem
foolish
to
those
who
do
not
know
on
what
little
things
the
whole
tone
of
our
spirits
sometimes
depends
but
if
an
even
balance
was
restored
yesterday
the
opposite
scale
kicked
the
beam
this
morning
not
a
speck
of
vapor
blurred
the
spotless
crystal
of
the
sky
as
i
walked
along
the
hanging
paths
of
the
alameda
the
sea
was
dazzling
with
a
purple
lustre
every
crag
and
notch
of
the
mountains
across
the
bay
every
shade
of
brown
or
gray
or
the
green
of
grassy
patches
was
drawn
and
tinted
with
a
pencil
so
exquisitely
delicate
as
almost
to
destroy
the
perspective
the
white
houses
of
algeciras
five
miles
off
appeared
close
at
hand
a
little
backed
by
miniature
hills
apes
hill
the
ancient
abyla
in
africa
advanced
to
meet
calpe
its
opposing
pillar
and
atlas
swept
away
to
the
east
ward
its
blue
becoming
paler
and
paler
till
the
powers
of
vision
finally
failed
from
the
top
of
the
southern
point
of
the
rock
i
saw
the
of
spain
as
far
as
malaga
and
the
snowy
top
of
one
of
the
sierra
nevada
looking
eastward
to
the
horizon
line
of
the
mediterranean
my
sight
extended
so
far
in
the
wonderful
clearness
of
the
air
that
the
convexity
of
the
earth
surface
was
plainly
to
be
seen
the
sea
instead
of
being
a
plane
was
slightly
convex
and
the
sky
instead
of
resting
upon
it
at
the
horizon
curved
down
beyond
it
as
the
upper
side
of
a
horn
curves
over
the
lower
when
one
looks
into
the
mouth
there
is
none
of
the
many
aspects
of
nature
more
grand
than
this
which
is
so
rarely
seen
that
i
believe
the
only
person
who
has
ever
described
it
is
humboldt
who
saw
it
looking
from
the
silla
de
caraccas
over
the
caribbean
sea
it
gives
you
the
impression
of
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
earth
and
looking
off
into
space
from
the
the
ocean
appears
either
flat
or
slightly
concave
and
æronauts
declare
that
this
apparent
concavity
becomes
more
marked
the
higher
they
ascend
it
is
only
at
those
rare
periods
when
the
air
is
so
miraculously
clear
as
to
produce
the
effect
of
rendering
impossible
the
slightest
optical
illusion
that
our
eyes
can
see
things
as
they
really
are
so
pure
was
the
atmosphere
that
at
meridian
the
moon
although
a
thin
sickle
three
days
distant
from
the
sun
shone
perfectly
white
and
clear
as
i
loitered
in
the
alameda
between
thick
hedges
of
geraniums
clumps
of
heliotrope
three
feet
high
and
luxuriant
masses
of
ivy
around
whose
warm
flowers
the
bees
clustered
and
hummed
i
could
only
think
of
the
voyage
as
a
hideous
dream
the
fog
and
gloom
had
been
in
my
own
eyes
and
in
my
own
brain
and
now
the
blessed
sun
shining
full
in
my
face
awoke
me
i
am
a
worshipper
of
the
sun
i
took
off
my
hat
to
him
as
i
stood
there
in
a
wilderness
of
white
crimson
and
purple
flowers
and
let
him
blaze
away
in
my
face
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
as
i
walked
home
with
my
back
to
him
i
often
turned
my
face
from
side
to
side
that
i
might
feel
his
touch
on
my
cheek
how
a
man
can
live
who
is
sentenced
to
a
year
imprisonment
is
more
than
i
can
understand
but
all
this
you
will
say
gives
you
no
picture
of
gibraltar
the
rock
is
so
familiar
to
all
the
world
in
prints
and
descriptions
that
i
find
nothing
new
to
say
of
it
except
that
it
is
by
no
means
so
barren
a
rock
as
the
island
of
malta
being
clothed
in
many
places
with
beautiful
groves
and
the
greenest
turf
besides
i
have
not
yet
seen
the
having
taken
passage
for
cadiz
this
afternoon
when
i
return
as
i
hope
to
do
in
twenty
days
after
visiting
seville
and
granada
i
shall
procure
permission
to

all
the
fortifications

left
gibraltar
on
the
evening
of
the
in
the
steamer
iberia
the
passage
to
cadiz
was
made
in
nine
hours
and
we
came
to
anchor
in
the
harbor
before
it
was
a
cheerful
picture
that
the
rising
sun
presented
to
us
the
long
white
front
of
the
city
facing
the
east
glowed
with
a
bright
rosy
lustre
on
a
ground
of
the
clearest
blue
the
tongue
of
land
on
which
cadiz
stands
is
low
but
the
houses
are
lifted
by
the
heavy
which
encompasses
them
the
consists
of
a
range
of
low
but
graceful
hills
while
in
the
the
mountains
of
ronda
rise
at
some
distance
i
went
immediately
on
shore
where
my
was
seized
upon
by
a
boy
with
the
rich
brown
complexion
of
one
murillo
beggars
who
trudged
off
with
it
to
the
gate
after
some
little
detention
there
i
was
conducted
to
a
long
deserted
building
where
i
waited
half
an
hour
before
the
proper
officer
came
when
the
latter
had
taken
his
private
toll
of
my
contraband
cigars
the
brown
imp
conducted
me
to
blanco
english
hotel
a
neat
and
comfortable
house
on
the
alameda
cadiz
is
soon
seen
notwithstanding
its
venerable
age
of
three
thousand
years
having
been
founded
by
hercules
who
figures
on
its
it
is
purely
a
commercial
city
and
has
neither
antiquities
nor
historic
associations
that
interest
any
but
englishmen
it
is
compactly
built
and
covers
a
smaller
space
than
accords
with
my
ideas
of
its
former
splendor
i
first
walked
around
the
enjoying
the
glorious
over
the
blue
waters
the
city
is
almost
insulated
the
triple
line
of
fortifications
on
the
land
side
being
of
but
trifling
length
a
rocky
ledge
stretches
out
into
the
sea
from
the
northern
point
and
at
its
extremity
rises
the
massive
tower
feet
high
the
walls
toward
the
sea
were
covered
with
companies
of
idle
anglers
fishing
with
cane
rods
of
enormous
length
on
the
open
waste
spaces
between
the
bastions
boys
had
spread
their
limed
cords
to
catch
singing
birds
with
chirping
decoys
placed
here
and
there
in
wicker
cages
numbers
of
boatmen
and
peasants
in
their
brown
jackets
studded
with
tags
and
bugles
and
those
round
black
caps
which
resemble
smashed
bandboxes
loitered
about
the
walls
or
lounged
on
the
grass
in
the
sun
except
along
the
alameda
which
fronts
the
bay
the
exterior
of
the
city
has
an
aspect
of
neglect
and
desertion
the
interior
however
atones
for
this
in
the
gay
and
lively
air
of
its
streets
which
though
narrow
are
regular
and
charmingly
clean
the
small
plazas
are
neatness
itself
and
one
is
too
content
with
this
to
ask
for
striking
architectural
effects
the
houses
are
tall
and
stately
of
the
most
dazzling
whiteness
and
though
you
could
point
out
no
one
as
a
pattern
of
style
the
general
effect
is
chaste
and
harmonious
in
fact
there
are
two
or
three
streets
which
you
would
almost
pronounce
faultless
the
numbers
of
hanging
balconies
and
of
paved
with
marble
and
surrounded
with
elegant
corridors
show
the
influence
of
moorish
taste
there
is
not
a
house
to
be
seen
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
cadiz
is
the
best
built
city
of
its
size
in
the
world
it
lies
white
as
snow
like
a
cluster
of
ivory
palaces
between
sea
and
sky
blue
and
silver
are
its
colors
and
as
everybody
knows
there
can
be
no
more
charming
contrast
i
visited
both
the
old
and
new
cathedrals
neither
of
which
is
particularly
interesting
the
latter
is
unfinished
and
might
have
been
a
fine
edifice
had
the
labor
and
money
expended
on
its
construction
been
directed
by
taste
the
interior
rich
as
it
is
in
marbles
and
sculpture
has
a
heavy
confused
effect
the
pillars
dividing
the
nave
from
the
are
enormous
composite
masses
each
one
consisting
of
six
corinthian
columns
stuck
around
and
against
a
central
shaft
more
satisfactory
to
me
was
the
which
i
visited
in
the
evening
and
where
the
dazzling
array
of
gaditanas
put
a
stop
to
architectural
criticism
the
women
of
cadiz
are
noted
for
their
beauty
and
their
graceful
gait
some
of
them
are
very
beautiful
it
is
true
but
beauty
is
not
the
rule
among
them
their
gait
however
is
the
most
graceful
possible
because
it
is
perfectly
free
and
natural
the
commonest
who
walks
the
streets
of
cadiz
would
put
to
shame
a
whole
score
of
our
mincing
and
wriggling
belles
honest
old
blanco
prepared
me
a
cup
of
chocolate
by
sunrise
next
morning
and
accompanied
me
down
to
the
quay
to
embark
for
seville
a
furious
wind
was
blowing
from
the
and
the
large
green
waves
raced
and
chased
one
another
incessantly
over
the
surface
of
the
bay
i
took
a
heavy
craft
which
the
boatmen
pushed
along
under
cover
of
the
pier
until
they
reached
the
end
when
the
sail
was
dropped
in
the
face
of
the
wind
and
away
we
shot
into
the
watery
tumult
the
boat
rocked
and
bounced
over
the
agitated
surface
running
with
one
gunwale
on
the
waves
and
sheets
of
briny
spray
broke
over
me
i
felt
considerably
relieved
when
i
reached
the
deck
of
the
steamer
but
it
was
then
diversion
enough
to
watch
those
who
followed
the
crowd
of
boats
pitching
tumultuously
around
the
steamer
jostling
against
each
other
their
hulls
gleaming
with
wet
as
they
rose
on
the
waves
striped
with
long
curded
lines
of
foam
would
have
made
a
fine
subject
for
the
pencil
of
achenbach
at
last
we
pushed
off
with
a
crowd
of
passengers
fore
and
aft
and
a
pyramid
of
luggage
piled
around
the
there
was
a
party
of
four
englishmen
on
board
and
on
making
their
acquaintance
i
found
one
of
them
to
be
a
friend
to
some
of
my
friends
sir
john
potter
the
progressive
of
manchester
the
wind
being
astern
we
ran
rapidly
along
the
coast
and
in
two
hours
entered
the
mouth
of
the
guadalquivir
this
name
comes
from
the
arabic
literally
the
great
valley
the
shores
are
a
dead
flat
the
right
bank
is
a
dreary
forest
of
stunted
pines
abounding
with
deer
and
other
game
on
the
left
is
the
dilapidated
town
of
san
lucar
whence
magellan
set
sail
on
his
first
voyage
around
the
world
a
mile
further
is
bonanza
the
port
of
xeres
where
we
touched
and
took
on
board
a
fresh
lot
of
passengers
thenceforth
for
four
hours
the
scenery
of
the
guadalquivir
had
a
most
distressing
sameness
the
banks
were
as
flat
as
a
board
with
here
and
there
a
straggling
growth
of
marshy
thickets
now
and
then
we
passed
a
hut
but
there
were
no
human
beings
to
be
seen
except
the
peasants
who
tended
the
large
flocks
of
sheep
and
cattle
a
sort
of
breakfast
was
served
in
the
cabin
but
so
great
was
the
number
of
guests
that
i
had
much
difficulty
in
getting
anything
to
eat
the
waiters
were
models
of
calmness
and
deliberation
as
we
approached
seville
some
low
hills
appeared
on
the
left
near
the
river
dazzling
white
villages
were
planted
at
their
foot
and
all
the
slopes
were
covered
with
olive
orchards
while
the
banks
of
the
stream
were
bordered
with
silvery
birch
trees
this
gave
the
landscape
in
spite
of
the
african
warmth
and
brightness
of
the
day
a
gray
and
almost
wintry
aspect
soon
the
graceful
giralda
or
famous
tower
of
seville
arose
in
the
distance
but
from
the
windings
of
the
river
we
were
half
an
hour
in
reaching
the
one
sees
nothing
of
the
beauty
of
seville
on
approaching
it
the
boat
stops
below
the
alameda
where
the
passengers
are
received
by
officers
who
in
my
case
did
not
verify
the
stories
told
of
them
in
cadiz
i
gave
my
to
a
boy
who
conducted
me
along
the
hot
and
dusty
banks
to
the
bridge
over
the
guadalquivir
where
he
turned
into
the
city
on
passing
the
gate
two
guards
stopped
my
baggage
notwithstanding
it
had
already
been
examined
what
said
i
do
you
examine
twice
on
entering
seville
yes
answered
one
twice
and
even
three
times
but
added
in
a
lower
tone
it
depends
entirely
on
yourself
with
that
he
slipped
behind
me
and
let
one
hand
fall
beside
my
pocket
the
transfer
of
a
small
coin
was
dexterously
made
and
i
passed
on
without
further
stoppage
to
the
fonda
de
madrid
sir
john
potter
engaged
antonio
bailli
the
noted
guide
of
seville
who
professes
to
have
been
the
cicerone
of
all
distinguished
travellers
from
lord
byron
and
washington
irving
down
to
owen
jones
and
i
readily
accepted
his
invitation
to
join
the
party
bailli
is
recommended
by
ford
as
fat
and
fat
he
certainly
is
and
very
when
speaking
of
himself
but
he
has
been
rather
spoiled
by
popularity
and
is
much
too
profuse
in
his
critical
remarks
on
art
and
architecture
nevertheless
as
my
stay
in
seville
is
limited
i
have
derived
no
slight
advantage
from
his
services
on
the
first
morning
i
took
an
early
stroll
through
the
streets
the
houses
are
glaringly
white
like
those
of
cadiz
but
are
smaller
and
have
not
the
same
stately
exteriors
the
windows
are
protected
by
iron
gratings
of
florid
patterns
and
as
many
of
these
are
painted
green
the
general
effect
is
pleasing
almost
every
door
opens
upon
a
or
courtyard
paved
with
black
and
white
marble
and
adorned
with
flowers
and
fountains
many
of
these
remain
from
the
time
of
the
moors
and
are
still
surrounded
by
the
delicate
arches
and
brilliant
of
that
period
the
populace
in
the
streets
are
entirely
spanish
the
jaunty
in
his
queer
black
cap
sash
and
embroidered
jacket
and
the
damsel
swimming
along
in
her
mantilla
and
armed
with
the
irresistible
fan
we
went
first
to
the
cathedral
built
on
the
site
of
the
great
mosque
of
abou
youssuf
yakoub
the
tall
giralda
beckoned
to
us
over
the
tops
of
the
intervening
buildings
and
finally
a
turn
in
the
street
brought
us
to
the
ancient
moorish
gateway
on
the
northern
side
this
is
an
admirable
specimen
of
the
arch
and
is
covered
with
elaborate
tracery
it
originally
opened
into
the
court
or
of
the
mosque
which
still
remains
and
is
shaded
by
a
grove
of
orange
trees
the
giralda
to
my
eye
is
a
more
perfect
tower
than
the
campanile
of
florence
or
that
of
san
marco
at
venice
which
is
evidently
an
idea
borrowed
from
it
the
moorish
structure
with
a
base
of
fifty
feet
square
rises
to
the
height
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
it
is
of
a
light
pink
color
and
the
sides
which
are
broken
here
and
there
by
exquisitely
proportioned
double
saracenic
arches
are
covered
from
top
to
bottom
with
arabesque
tracery
cut
in
strong
relief
upon
this
tower
a
spanish
architect
has
placed
a
tapering
spire
one
hundred
feet
high
which
fortunately
harmonizes
with
the
general
design
and
gives
the
crowning
grace
to
the
work
the
cathedral
of
seville
may
rank
as
one
of
the
grandest
gothic
piles
in
europe
the
nave
lacks
but
five
feet
of
being
as
high
as
that
of
peter
while
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
edifice
are
on
a
commensurate
scale
the
windows
of
stained
glass
fill
the
interior
with
a
soft
and
light
mellower
and
more
gentle
than
the
sombre
twilight
of
the
gothic
cathedrals
of
europe
the
wealth
lavished
on
the
smaller
chapels
and
shrines
is
prodigious
and
the
high
altar
inclosed
within
a
gilded
railing
fifty
feet
high
is
probably
the
most
enormous
mass
of
in
existence
the
cathedral
in
fact
is
encumbered
with
its
riches
while
they
bewilder
you
as
monuments
of
human
labor
and
patience
they
detract
from
the
grand
simplicity
of
the
building
the
great
nave
on
each
side
of
the
transept
is
quite
blocked
up
so
that
the
choir
and
magnificent
royal
chapel
behind
it
have
almost
the
effect
of
detached
edifices
we
returned
again
this
morning
remaining
two
hours
and
succeeded
in
making
a
thorough
survey
including
a
number
of
trashy
pictures
and
barbarously
rich
shrines
murillo
guardian
angel
and
the
vision
of
antonio
are
the
only
gems
the
treasury
contains
a
number
of
sacred
vessels
of
silver
gold
and
jewels
among
other
things
the
keys
of
moorish
seville
a
cross
made
of
the
first
gold
brought
from
the
by
columbus
and
another
from
that
robbed
in
mexico
by
cortez
the
cathedral
won
my
admiration
more
and
more
the
placing
of
the
numerous
windows
and
their
rich
coloring
produce
the
most
glorious
effects
of
light
in
the
lofty
aisles
and
one
is
constantly
finding
new
vistas
new
combinations
of
pillar
arch
and
shrine
the
building
is
in
itself
a
treasury
of
the
grandest
gothic
pictures
from
the
cathedral
we
went
to
the
alcazar
or
palace
of
the
moorish
kings
we
entered
by
a
long
passage
with
round
arches
on
either
side
resting
on
twin
pillars
placed
at
right
angles
to
the
line
of
the
arch
as
one
sees
both
in
saracenic
and
byzantine
structures
finally
old
bailli
brought
us
into
a
dull
deserted
where
we
were
surprised
by
the
sight
of
an
entire
moorish
façade
with
its
pointed
arches
its
projecting
roof
its
rich
sculptured
ornaments
and
its
illuminations
of
red
blue
green
and
gold
it
has
been
lately
restored
and
now
rivals
in
freshness
and
brilliancy
any
of
the
rich
houses
of
damascus
a
doorway
entirely
too
low
and
mean
for
the
splendor
of
the
walls
above
it
admitted
us
into
the
first
court
on
each
side
of
the
passage
are
the
rooms
of
the
guard
and
the
moorish
nobles
within
all
is
pure
saracenic
and
absolutely
perfect
in
its
grace
and
richness
it
is
the
realization
of
an
oriental
dream
it
is
the
poetry
and
luxury
of
the
east
in
tangible
forms
where
so
much
depends
on
the
proportion
and
harmony
of
the
different
parts
on
those
correspondences
the
union
of
which
creates
that
nameless
soul
of
the
work
which
can
not
be
expressed
in
words
it
is
useless
to
describe
details
from
first
to
last
the
chambers
of
state
the
fringed
arches
the
open
tracery
light
and
frail
as
the
crystallized
on
a
the
courts
fit
to
be
vestibules
to
paradise
the
with
its
wondrous
sculptures
its
columns
and
pavement
of
marble
and
its
gilded
dome
the
garden
gorgeous
with
its
palm
banana
and
all
were
in
perfect
keeping
all
jewels
of
equal
lustre
forming
a
diadem
which
still
lends
a
royal
dignity
to
the
phantom
of
moorish
power
we
then
passed
into
the
gardens
laid
out
by
the
spanish
monarchs
trim
mathematical
designs
in
box
and
myrtle
with
concealed
fountains
springing
up
everywhere
unawares
in
the
midst
of
the
paven
walks
yet
still
made
beautiful
by
the
roses
and
jessamines
that
hung
in
rank
clusters
over
the
marble
balustrades
and
by
the
clumps
of
tall
orange
trees
bending
to
earth
under
the
weight
of
their
fruitage
we
afterward
visited
pilate
house
as
it
is
called
a
fine
palace
now
belonging
to
the
duke
of
medina
coeli
it
is
very
rich
and
elegant
but
stands
in
the
same
relation
to
the
alcazar
as
a
good
copy
does
to
the
original
picture
the
grand
staircase
nevertheless
is
a
marvel
of
tile
work
unlike
anything
else
in
seville
and
exhibits
a
genius
in
the
invention
of
elaborate
ornamental
patterns
which
is
truly
wonderful
a
number
of
workmen
were
busy
in
restoring
the
palace
to
fit
it
for
the
residence
of
the
young
duke
the
moorish
sculptures
are
reproduced
in
plaster
which
at
least
has
a
better
effect
than
the
fatal
whitewash
under
which
the
original
tints
of
the
alcazar
are
hidden
in
the
courts
stand
a
number
of
roman
busts
spanish
antiquities
and
therefore
not
of
great
merit
singularly
out
of
place
in
niches
surrounded
by
arabic
devices
and
sentences
from
the
koran
this
morning
i
climbed
the
giralda
the
sun
had
just
risen
and
the
clay
was
fresh
and
a
little
door
in
the
cathedral
near
the
foot
of
the
tower
stood
open
and
i
entered
a
rather
slovenly
sevillaña
had
just
completed
her
toilet
but
two
children
were
still
in
undress
however
she
opened
a
door
in
the
tower
and
i
went
up
without
hindrance
the
ascent
is
by
easy
ramps
and
i
walked
four
hundred
yards
or
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
reaching
the
top
of
the
moorish
part
the
panoramic
view
was
superb
to
the
east
and
west
the
great
valley
made
a
level
line
on
a
horizon
there
were
ranges
of
hills
in
the
north
and
south
and
those
rising
near
the
city
clothed
in
a
gray
mantle
of
were
picturesquely
crowned
with
villages
the
guadalquivir
winding
in
the
most
sinuous
mazes
had
no
longer
a
turbid
hue
he
reflected
the
blue
morning
sky
and
gleamed
brightly
between
his
borders
of
birch
and
willow
seville
sparkled
white
and
fair
under
my
feet
her
painted
towers
and
tiled
domes
rising
thickly
out
of
the
mass
of
buildings
the
level
sun
threw
shadows
into
the
numberless
courts
permitting
the
mixture
of
spanish
and
moorish
architecture
to
be
plainly
discerned
even
at
that
height
a
thin
golden
vapor
softened
the
features
of
the
landscape
towards
the
sun
while
on
the
opposite
side
every
object
stood
out
in
the
sharpest
and
clearest
outlines
on
our
way
to
the
muséo
bailli
took
us
to
the
house
of
a
friend
of
his
in
order
that
we
might
taste
real
manzanilla
wine
this
is
a
pale
vintage
produced
in
the
valley
of
the
guadalquivir
it
is
flavored
with
camomile
blossoms
and
is
said
to
be
a
fine
tonic
for
weak
stomachs
the
master
then
produced
a
wine
which
he
declared
to
be
thirty
years
old
it
was
almost
a
syrup
in
consistence
and
tasted
more
of
sarsaparilla
than
grapes
none
of
us
relished
it
except
bailli
who
was
so
inspired
by
the
draught
that
he
sang
us
two
moorish
songs
and
an
andalusian
catch
full
of
fun
and
drollery
the
muséo
contains
a
great
amount
of
bad
pictures
but
it
also
contains
of
murillo
works
many
of
them
of
his
best
period
to
those
who
have
only
seen
his
tender
spiritual
conceptions
and
assumptions
his
vision
of
francis
in
this
gallery
reveals
a
mastery
of
the
higher
walks
of
his
art
which
they
would
not
have
anticipated
but
it
is
in
his
cherubs
and
his
infant
christs
that
he
excels
no
one
ever
painted
infantile
grace
and
beauty
with
so
true
a
pencil
there
is
but
one
velasquez
in
the
collection
and
the
only
thing
that
interested
me
in
two
halls
filled
with
rubbish
was
a
conception
by
murillo
mulatto
pupil
said
by
some
to
have
been
his
slave
although
an
imitation
of
the
great
master
it
is
a
picture
of
much
sweetness
and
beauty
there
is
no
other
work
of
the
artist
in
existence
and
this
as
the
only
production
of
the
kind
by
a
painter
of
mixed
african
blood
ought
to
belong
to
the
republic
of
liberia
among
the
other
guests
at

is
thomas
hobhouse
brother
of
byron
friend
we
had
a
pleasant
party
in
the
court
this
evening
listening
to
blind
pépé
who
sang
to
his
guitar
a
medley
of
merry
andalusian
refrains
singing
made
the
old
man
courageous
and
at
the
close
he
gave
us
the
radical
song
of
spain
which
is
now
strictly
prohibited
the
air
is
charming
but
too
gay
one
would
sooner
dance
than
fight
to
its
measures
it
does
not
bring
the
hand
to
the
sword

granada
it
is
an
enviable
sensation
to
feel
for
the
first
time
that
you
are
in

no
amount
of
travelling
can
weaken
the
romantic
interest
which
clings
about
this
storied
place
or
take
away
aught
from
the
freshness
of
that
emotion
with
which
you
first
behold
it
i
sit
almost
at
the
foot
of
the
alhambra
whose
walls
i
can
see
from
my
window
quite
satisfied
for
with
being
here
it
has
been
raining
since
i
arrived
the
thunder
is
crashing
overhead
and
the
mountains
are
covered
with
clouds
so
i
am
kept
with
the
luxury
of
knowing
that
all
the
wonders
of
the
place
are
within
my
reach
and
now
let
me
beguile
the
dull
weather
by
giving
you
a
sketch
of
my
journey
from
seville
hither
there
are
three
lines
of
stages
from
seville
to
madrid
and
their
competition
has
reduced
the
fare
to
which
for
a
ride
of
miles
is
remarkably
cheap
the
trip
is
usually
made
in
three
days
and
a
half
a
branch
line
from
baylen
nearly
strikes
southward
to
granada
and
as
there
is
no
competition
on
this
part
of
the
road
i
was
charged
for
a
through
seat
in
the
on
account
of
the
lateness
of
the
season
and
the
limited
time
at
my
command
this
was
preferable
to
taking
horses
and
riding
across
the
country
from
seville
to
cordova
accordingly
at
an
early
hour
on
thursday
morning
last
furnished
with
a
travelling
ticket
inscribed
don
valtar
de
talor
myself
i
took
leave
of
my
english
friends
at
the
fonda
de
madrid
got
into
an
immense
lumbering
yellow
vehicle
drawn
by
ten
mules
and
started
trusting
to
my
good
luck
and
bad
spanish
to
get
safely
through
the
commencement
however
was
unpropitious
and
very
often
a
stumble
at
starting
makes
the
whole
journey
limp
the
near
mule
in
the
foremost
span
was
a
horse
ridden
by
our
postillion
and
nothing
could
prevent
that
horse
from
darting
into
all
sorts
of
streets
and
alleys
where
we
had
no
desire
to
go
as
all
mules
have
implicit
faith
in
horses
of
course
the
rest
of
the
animals
followed
we
were
half
an
hour
in
getting
out
of
seville
and
when
at
last
we
reached
the
open
road
and
dashed
off
at
full
gallop
one
of
the
mules
in
the
traces
fell
and
was
dragged
in
the
dust
some
twenty
or
thirty
yards
before
we
could
stop
my
companions
in
the
coupé
were
a
young
spanish
officer
and
his
pretty
andalusian
bride
who
was
making
her
first
journey
from
home
and
after
these
mishaps
was
in
a
state
of
constant
fear
and
anxiety
the
first
stage
across
the
valley
of
the
guadalquivir
took
us
to
the
town
of
alcalà
which
lies
in
the
lap
of
the
hills
above
the
beautiful
little
river
guadaira
it
is
a
picturesque
spot
the
naked
cliffs
overhanging
the
stream
have
the
rich
red
hue
of
cinnabar
and
the
trees
and
shrubbery
in
the
meadows
and
on
the
are
ready
grouped
to
the
hand
the
town
is
called
alcalà
de
los
panadores
of
the
bakers
from
its
hundreds
of
flour
mills
and
which
supply
seville
with
those
white
fine
delicious
twists
of
which
spain
may
be
justly
proud
they
should
have
been
sent
to
the
exhibition
last
year
with
the
toledo
blades
and
the
wooden
mosaics
we
left
the
place
and
its
population
and
turned
eastward
into
wide
rolling
tracts
scattered
here
and
there
with
gnarled
olive
trees
the
soil
was
loose
and
sandy
and
hedges
of
aloes
lined
the
road
the
country
is
thinly
populated
and
very
little
of
it
under
cultivation
about
noon
we
reached
carmona
which
was
founded
by
the
romans
as
indeed
were
nearly
all
the
towns
of
southern
spain
it
occupies
the
crest
and
northern
slope
of
a
high
hill
whereon
the
ancient
moorish
castle
still
stands
the
alcazar
or
palace
and
the
moorish
walls
also
remain
though
in
a
very
ruinous
condition
here
we
stopped
to
dinner
for
the
nueva
peninsular
in
which
i
was
embarked
has
its
hotels
all
along
the
route
like
that
of
zurutuza
in
mexico
we
were
conducted
into
a
small
room
adjoining
the
stables
and
adorned
with
colored
prints
illustrating
the
history
of
don
john
of
austria
the
plates
and
other
appendages
were
of
very
ordinary
quality
but
indisputably
clean
we
seated
ourselves
and
presently
the
dinner
appeared
first
a
vermicelli
which
i
found
palatable
then
the
national
a
dish
of
enormous
yellow
peas
sprinkled
with
bits
of
bacon
and
flavored
with
oil
then
three
successive
courses
of
chicken
boiled
stewed
and
roasted
but
in
every
case
done
to
rags
and
without
a
particle
of
the
original
flavor
this
was
the
usual
style
of
our
meals
on
the
road
whether
breakfast
dinner
or
supper
except
that
kid
was
sometimes
substituted
for
fowl
and
that
the
oil
employed
being
more
or
less
rancid
gave
different
flavors
to
the
dishes
a
course
of
melons
grapes
or
pomegranates
wound
up
the
repast
the
price
of
which
varied
from
ten
to
twelve
reals
a
real
being
about
a
in
seville
at
the
fonda
de
madrid
the
cooking
is
really
excellent
but
further
in
the
interior
judging
from
what
i
have
heard
it
is
even
worse
than
i
have
described
continuing
our
journey
we
passed
around
the
southern
brow
of
the
hill
under
the
moorish
battlements
here
a
superb
view
opened
to
the
south
and
east
over
the
wide
vega
of
carmona
as
far
as
the
mountain
chain
which
separates
it
from
the
plain
of
granada
the
city
has
for
a
coat
of
arms
a
silver
star
in
an
azure
field
with
the
pompous
motto
as
lucifer
shines
in
the
morning
so
shines
carmona
in
andalusia
if
it
shines
at
all
it
is
because
it
is
a
city
set
upon
a
hill
for
that
is
the
only
splendor
i
could
find
about
the
place
the
vega
of
carmona
is
partially
cultivated
and
now
wears
a
sombre
brown
hue
from
its
tracts
of
ploughed
land
cultivation
soon
ceased
however
and
we
entered
on
a
a
boundless
plain
of
waste
land
covered
with
thickets
of
palmettos
flocks
of
goats
and
sheep
guarded
by
shepherds
in
brown
cloaks
wandered
here
and
there
and
except
their
huts
and
an
isolated
house
with
its
group
of
there
was
no
sign
of
habitation
the
road
was
a
deep
red
sand
and
our
mules
toiled
along
slowly
and
painfully
urged
by
the
incessant
cries
of
the
or
conductor
and
his
as
the
mayoral
whip
could
only
reach
the
second
span
the
business
of
the
latter
was
to
jump
down
every
ten
minutes
run
ahead
and
belabor
the
flanks
of
the
foremost
mules
uttering
at
the
same
time
a
series
of
sharp
howls
which
seemed
to
strike
the
poor
beasts
with
quite
as
much
severity
as
his
whip
i
defy
even
a
spanish
ear
to
distinguish
the
import
of
these
cries
and
the
great
wonder
was
how
they
could
all
come
out
of
one
small
throat
when
it
came
to
a
hard
pull
they
cracked
and
exploded
like
volleys
of
musketry
and
flew
like
about
the
ears
of
the
the
postillion
having
only
the
care
of
the
foremost
span
is
a
silent
man
but
he
has
contracted
a
habit
of
sleeping
in
the
saddle
which
i
mention
for
the
benefit
of
timid
travellers
as
it
adds
to
the
interest
of
a
journey
by
night
the
clouds
which
had
been
gathering
all
day
now
settled
down
upon
the
plain
and
night
came
on
with
a
dull
rain
at
eight
we
reached
the
city
of
ecija
where
we
had
two
hours
halt
and
supper
it
was
so
dark
and
rainy
that
i
saw
nothing
not
even
the
classic
xenil
the
river
of
granada
which
flows
through
the
city
on
its
way
to
the
guadalquivir
the
night
wore
slowly
away
and
while
the
drowsed
on
his
post
i
caught
snatches
of
sleep
between
his
cries
as
the
landscape
began
to
grow
distinct
in
the
gray
cloudy
dawn
we
saw
before
us
cordova
with
the
dark
range
of
the
sierra
morena
rising
behind
it
this
city
once
the
glory
of
moorish
spain
the
capital
of
the
great
containing
when
in
its
prime
a
million
of
inhabitants
is
now
a
melancholy
wreck
it
has
not
a
shadow
of
the
art
science
and
taste
which
then
distinguished
it
and
the
only
interest
it
now
possesses
is
from
these
associations
and
the
despoiled
remnant
of
its
renowned
mosque
we
crossed
the
guadalquivir
on
a
fine
bridge
built
on
roman
foundations
and
drove
slowly
down
the
one
long
rough
crooked
street
the
diligence
stops
for
an
hour
to
allow
passengers
to
breakfast
but
my
first
thought
was
for
the
as
it
is
still
called
it
is
closed
said
the
ragged
crowd
that
congregated
about
us
you
can
not
get
in
until
eight
but
i
remembered
that
a
silver
key
will
open
anything
in
spain
and
taking
a
mozo
as
a
guide
we
hurried
off
as
fast
as
the
rough
pavements
would
permit
we
had
to
retrace
the
whole
length
of
the
city
but
on
reaching
the
cathedral
found
it
open
the
exterior
is
low
and
quite
plain
though
of
great
extent
a
moorish
gateway
admitted
me
into
the
original
or
of
the
mosque
which
is
planted
with
orange
trees
and
contains
the
fountain
for
the
ablutions
of
moslem
worshippers
in
the
centre
the
area
of
the
mosque
proper
exclusive
of
the
is
about
by
feet
it
was
built
on
the
plan
of
the
great
mosque
of
damascus
about
the
end
of
the
eighth
century
the
materials
including
twelve
hundred
columns
of
marble
jasper
and
porphyry
from
the
ruins
of
carthage
and
the
temples
of
asia
minor
to
a
christian
basilica
of
the
gothic
domination
which
was
built
upon
the
foundations
of
a
roman
temple
of
janus
so
that
the
three
great
creeds
of
the
world
have
here
at
different
times
had
their
seat
the
moors
considered
this
mosque
as
second
in
holiness
to
the
kaaba
of
mecca
and
made
pilgrimages
to
it
from
all
parts
of
moslem
spain
and
barbary
even
now
although
shorn
of
much
of
its
glory
it
surpasses
any
oriental
mosque
into
which
i
have
penetrated
except
sophia
which
is
a
christian
edifice
all
the
nineteen
original
entrances
beautiful
arches
are
closed
except
the
central
one
i
entered
by
a
low
door
in
one
corner
of
the
corridor
a
wilderness
of
columns
connected
by
double
arches
one
springing
above
the
other
with
an
opening
between
spread
their
dusky
aisles
before
me
in
the
morning
twilight
the
eight
hundred
and
fifty
shafts
of
this
marble
forest
formed
labyrinths
and
mazes
which
at
that
early
hour
appeared
boundless
for
their
long
vistas
disappeared
in
the
shadows
lamps
were
burning
before
distant
shrines
and
a
few
worshippers
were
kneeling
silently
here
and
there
the
sound
of
my
own
footsteps
as
i
wandered
through
the
ranks
of
pillars
was
all
that
i
heard
in
the
centre
of
the
wood
for
such
it
seemed
rises
the
choir
a
gaudy
and
tasteless
excrescence
added
by
the
christians
even
charles
who
laid
a
merciless
hand
on
the
alhambra
reproved
the
bishop
of
cordova
for
this
barbarous
and
unnecessary
disfigurement
the
sacristan
lighted
lamps
in
order
to
show
me
the
moorish
chapels
nothing
but
the
precious
materials
of
which
these
exquisite
structures
are
composed
could
have
saved
them
from
the
holy
hands
of
the
inquisition
which
intentionally
destroyed
all
the
roman
antiquities
of
cordova
here
the
fringed
arches
the
filigrees
the
wreathed
inscriptions
and
the
domes
of
pendent
stalactites
which
enchant
you
in
the
alcazar
of
seville
are
repeated
not
in
stucco
but
in
purest
marble
while
the
entrance
to
the
holy
of
holies
is
probably
the
most
glorious
piece
of
mosaic
in
the
world
the
pavement
of
the
interior
is
deeply
worn
by
the
knees
of
the
moslem
pilgrims
who
compassed
it
seven
times
kneeling
as
they
now
do
in
the
kaaba
at
mecca
the
sides
are
embroidered
with
sentences
from
the
koran
in
cufic
characters
and
the
roof
is
in
the
form
of
a
fluted
shell
of
a
single
piece
of
pure
white
marble
fifteen
feet
in
diameter
the
roof
of
the
vestibule
is
a
wonderful
piece
of
workmanship
formed
of
pointed
arches
wreathed
and
twined
through
each
other
like
no
people
ever
wrought
poetry
into
stone
so
perfectly
as
the
saracens
in
looking
on
these
precious
relics
of
an
elegant
and
refined
race
i
can
not
help
feeling
a
strong
regret
that
their
kingdom
ever
passed
into
other
hands
leaving
cordova
our
road
followed
the
guadalquivir
along
the
foot
of
the
sierra
morena
which
rose
dark
and
stern
a
barrier
to
the
central
of
la
mancha
at
alcolea
we
crossed
the
river
on
a
noble
bridge
of
black
marble
out
of
all
keeping
with
the
miserable
road
it
rained
incessantly
and
the
scenery
through
which
we
passed
had
a
wild
and
gloomy
character
the
only
tree
to
be
seen
was
the
olive
which
covered
the
hills
far
and
near
the
profusion
of
its
fruit
showing
the
natural
richness
of
the
soil
this
part
of
the
road
is
sometimes
infested
with
robbers
and
once
when
i
saw
two
individuals
waiting
for
us
in
a
lonely
defile
with
thrust
out
from
under
their
black
cloaks
i
anticipated
a
recurrence
of
a
former
unpleasant
experience
but
they
proved
to
be
members
of
the
and
therefore
our
protectors
the
ruts
and
quagmires
made
by
the
rain
retarded
our
progress
and
it
was
dark
when
we
reached
andujar
fourteen
leagues
from
cordova
to
baylen
where
i
was
to
quit
the
diligence
and
take
another
coming
down
from
madrid
to
granada
was
four
leagues
further
we
journeyed
on
in
the
dark
in
a
pouring
rain
up
and
down
hill
for
some
hours
when
all
at
once
the
cries
of
the
mozo
ceased
and
the
diligence
came
to
a
dead
stop
there
was
some
talk
between
our
conductors
and
then
the
mayoral
opened
the
door
and
invited
us
to
get
out
the
postillion
had
fallen
asleep
and
the
mules
had
taken
us
into
a
wrong
road
an
attempt
was
made
to
turn
the
diligence
but
failed
leaving
it
standing
plump
against
a
high
bank
of
mud
we
stood
meanwhile
shivering
in
the
cold
and
wet
and
the
fair
andalusian
shed
abundance
of
tears
fortunately
baylen
was
close
at
hand
and
after
some
delay
two
men
came
with
lanterns
and
escorted
us
to
the
or
inn
where
we
arrived
at
midnight
the
diligence
from
madrid
which
was
due
six
hours
before
had
not
made
its
appearance
and
we
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
in
a
cold
room
fasting
for
the
meal
was
only
to
be
served
when
the
other
passengers
came
at
finally
a
single
dish
of
oily
meat
was
vouchsafed
to
us
and
as
it
was
now
certain
that
some
accident
had
happened
the
passengers
to
madrid
requested
the
to
send
them
on
in
an
extra
conveyance
this
he
refused
and
they
began
to
talk
about
getting
up
a
pronunciamento
when
a
messenger
arrived
with
the
news
that
the
diligence
had
broken
down
at
midnight
about
two
leagues
off
tools
were
thereupon
dispatched
nine
hours
after
the
accident
happened
and
we
might
hope
to
be
released
from
our
imprisonment
in
four
or
five
more
baylen
is
a
wretched
place
celebrated
for
having
the
first
which
those
see
who
come
from
madrid
and
for
the
victory
gained
by
castaños
over
the
french
forces
under
dupont
which
occasioned
the
flight
of
joseph
buonaparte
from
madrid
and
the
temporary
liberation
of
spain
from
the
french
yoke
castaños
who
received
the
title
of
duke
de
baylen
and
is
compared
by
the
spaniards
to
wellington
died
about
three
months
ago
the
i
passed
in
the
night
the
i
found
but
it
is
now
a
mere
stump
the
leaves
having
been
stripped
off
to
protect
the
houses
of
the
inhabitants
from
lightning
our
posada
had
one
of
them
hung
at
the
window
at
last
the
diligence
came
and
at
three
when
i
ought
to
have
been
in
sight
of
granada
i
left
the
forlorn
walls
of
baylen
my
were
a
young
sprig
of
the
spanish
nobility
and
three
nuns
the
rest
of
the
journey
that
afternoon
was
through
a
wide
hilly
region
entirely
bare
of
trees
and
habitations
and
but
partially
cultivated
there
was
something
sublime
in
its
very
nakedness
and
loneliness
and
i
felt
attracted
to
it
as
i
do
towards
the
desert
in
fact
although
i
have
seen
little
fine
scenery
since
leaving
seville
have
had
the
worst
of
weather
and
no
very
pleasant
travelling
experiences
the
country
has
exercised
a
fascination
over
me
which
i
do
not
quite
understand
i
find
myself
constantly
on
the
point
of
making
a
vow
to
return
again
much
to
my
regret
night
set
in
before
we
reached
jaen
the
capital
of
the
moorish
kingdom
of
that
name
we
halted
for
a
short
time
in
the
large
plaza
of
the
town
where
the
dash
of
fountains
mingled
with
the
sound
of
the
rain
and
the
black
jagged
outline
of
a
mountain
overhanging
the
place
was
visible
through
the
storm
all
night
we
journeyed
on
through
the
mountains
sometimes
splashing
through
swollen
streams
sometimes
coming
almost
to
a
halt
in
beds
of
deep
mud
when
this
morning
dawned
we
were
ascending
through
wild
stony
hills
overgrown
with
shrubbery
and
the
driver
said
we
were
six
leagues
from
granada
still
on
through
a
lonely
country
with
now
and
then
a
large
or
country
inn
by
the
and
about
nine
as
the
sky
became
more
clear
i
saw
in
front
of
us
high
up
under
the
clouds
the
of
the
sierra
nevada
an
hour
afterwards
we
were
riding
between
gardens
vineyards
and
olive
orchards
with
the
magnificent
vega
of
granada
stretching
far
away
on
the
right
and
the
vermilion
towers
of

the
heights

in

who
has
not
in
granada
been
verily
he
has
nothing
seen
granada
immediately
on
reaching
here
i
was
set
upon
by
an
old
gentleman
who
wanted
to
act
as
guide
but
the
mozo
of
the
hotel
put
into
my
hand
a
card
inscribed
don
mateo
ximenez
guide
to
the
celebrated
washington
irving
and
i
dismissed
the
other
applicant
the
next
morning
as
the
mozo
brought
me
my
chocolate
he
said
señor
is
waiting
for
you
the
little
one
turned
out
to
be
the
son
of
old
mateo
honest
mateo
who
still
lives
up
in
the
alhambra
but
is
now
rather
too
old
to
continue
his
business
except
on
great
occasions
i
accepted
the
young
mateo
who
spoke
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
of
irving
avowing
that
the
whole
family
was
devoted
to
him
in
life
and
death
it
was
still
raining
furiously
and
the
golden
darro
which
roars
in
front
of
the
hotel
was
a
swollen
brown
flood
i
do
wonder
that
he
sometimes
threatens
as
the
old
couplet
says
to
burst
up
the
zacatin
and
bear
it
down
to
his
bride
the
xenil
towards
noon
the
clouds
broke
away
a
little
and
we
sallied
out
passing
through
the
gate
and
square
of
vivarrambla
may
not
this
name
come
from
the
arabic
the
gate
of
the
sand
we
soon
reached
the
cathedral
this
massive
structure
which
makes
a
good
feature
in
the
distant
view
of
granada
is
not
at
all
imposing
near
at
hand
the
interior
is
a
mixture
of
gothic
and
roman
glaring
with
whitewash
and
broken
like
that
of
seville
by
a
wooden
choir
and
two
grand
organs
blocking
up
the
nave
some
of
the
side
chapels
nevertheless
are
splendid
masses
of
carving
and
gilding
in
one
of
them
there
are
two
portraits
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
supposed
to
be
by
alonzo
cano
the
cathedral
contains
some
other
good
pictures
by
the
same
master
but
all
its
former
treasures
were
carried
off
by
the
french
we
next
went
to
the
picture
gallery
which
is
in
the
franciscan
convent
there
are
two
small
murillos
much
damaged
some
tolerable
alonzo
canos
a
few
pictures
by
juan
de
sevilla
and
a
hundred
or
more
by
authors
whose
names
i
did
not
inquire
for
a
more
hideous
collection
of
trash
never
met
my
eye
one
of
them
represents
a
miracle
performed
by
two
saints
who
cut
off
the
diseased
leg
of
a
sick
white
man
and
replace
it
by
the
sound
leg
of
a
dead
negro
whose
body
is
seen
lying
beside
the
bed
judging
from
the
ghastly
face
of
the
patient
the
operation
is
rather
painful
though
the
story
goes
that
the
black
leg
grew
fast
and
the
man
recovered
the
picture
at
least
illustrates
the
absence
of
prejudice
of
color
among
the
saints
we
went
into
the
adjoining
church
of
santo
domingo
which
has
several
very
rich
shrines
of
marble
and
gold
a
sort
of
priestly
sacristan
opened
the
church
of
the
madonna
del
rosario
glittering
mixture
of
marble
gold
and
which
has
rather
a
rich
effect
the
beautiful
yellow
and
red
veined
marbles
are
from
the
sierra
nevada
the
sacred
madonna
a
big
doll
with
staring
eyes
and
pink
cheeks
has
a
dress
of
silver
shaped
like
an
extinguisher
and
encrusted
with
rubies
and
other
precious
stones
the
utter
absence
of
taste
in
most
catholic
shrines
is
an
extraordinary
thing
it
seems
remarkable
that
a
church
which
has
produced
so
many
glorious
artists
should
so
constantly
and
grossly
violate
the
simplest
rules
of
art
the
only
shrine
which
i
have
seen
which
was
in
keeping
with
the
object
adored
is
that
of
the
virgin
at
nazareth
where
there
is
neither
picture
nor
image
but
only
vases
of
fragrant
flowers
and
perfumed
oil
in
golden
lamps
burning
before
a
tablet
of
spotless
marble
among
the
decorations
of
the
chapel
there
are
a
host
of
cherubs
frescoed
on
the
ceiling
and
one
of
them
is
represented
in
the
act
of
firing
off
a
blunderbuss
is
it
true
that
the
angels
carry
blunderbusses
i
asked
the
priest
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
a
sort
of
and
said
nothing
in
the
cathedral
on
the
plinths
of
the
columns
in
the
outer
aisles
are
several
notices
to
the
effect
that
whoever
speaks
to
women
either
in
the
nave
or
the
aisles
thereby
puts
himself
in
danger
of
excommunication
i
could
not
help
laughing
as
i
read
this
monkish
and
yet
most
statute
oh
said
mateo
all
that
was
in
the
despotic
times
it
is
not
so
now
a
deluge
of
rain
put
a
stop
to
my
until
the
next
morning
when
i
set
out
with
mateo
to
visit
the
royal
chapel
a
murder
had
been
committed
in
the
night
near
the
entrance
of
the
zacatin
and
the
were
still
red
with
the
blood
of
the
victim
a
of
some
sort
was
going
on
in
the
chapel
and
we
went
into
the
sacristy
to
wait
the
priests
and
choristers
were
there
changing
their
robes
they
saluted
me
though
there
was
an
expression
in
their
faces
that
plainly
said
a
heretic
when
the
service
was
concluded
i
went
into
the
chapel
and
examined
the
high
altar
with
its
rude
representing
the
surrender
of
granada
the
portraits
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
cardinal
ximenez
gonzalvo
of
cordova
and
king
boabdil
are
very
curious
another
tablet
represents
the
baptism
of
the
conquered
moors
in
the
centre
of
the
chapel
stand
the
monuments
erected
to
ferdinand
and
isabella
and
their
successors
philip
l
and
maria
by
charles
they
are
tall
catafalques
of
white
marble
superbly
sculptured
with
the
full
length
effigies
of
the
monarchs
upon
them
the
figures
are
admirable
that
of
isabella
especially
though
the
features
are
settled
in
the
repose
of
death
expresses
all
the
grand
and
noble
traits
which
belonged
to
her
character
the
sacristan
removed
the
matting
from
a
part
of
the
floor
disclosing
an
iron
grating
underneath
a
damp
mouldly
smell
significant
of
death
and
decay
came
up
through
the
opening
he
lighted
two
long
waxen
tapers
lifted
the
grating
and
i
followed
him
down
the
narrow
steps
into
the
vault
where
lie
the
coffins
of
the
catholic
sovereigns
they
were
brought
here
from
the
alhambra
in
the
leaden
sarcophagi
containing
the
bodies
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
lie
side
by
side
on
stone
slabs
and
as
i
stood
between
the
two
resting
a
hand
on
each
the
sacristan
placed
the
tapers
in
apertures
in
the
stone
at
the
head
and
foot
they
sleep
as
they
wished
in
their
beloved
granada
and
no
profane
hand
has
ever
disturbed
the
repose
of
their
ashes
after
visiting
the
church
of
san
jeronimo
founded
by
gonzalvo
of
cordova
i
went
to
the
adjoining
church
and
hospital
of
san
juan
de
dios
a
fat
priest
washing
his
hands
in
the
sacristy
sent
a
boy
to
show
me
the
chapel
of
san
juan
and
the
relics
the
remains
of
the
saint
rest
in
a
silver
chest
standing
in
the
centre
of
a
chapel
among
the
relics
is
a
thorn
from
the
crown
of
christ
which
as
any
botanist
may
see
must
have
grown
on
a
different
plant
from
the
other
thorn
they
show
at
seville
and
neither
kind
is
found
in
palestine
the
true
the
nebbuk
has
very
small
thorns
but
nothing
could
be
more
cruel
as
i
found
when
riding
through
patches
of
it
near
jericho
the
boy
also
showed
me
a
tooth
of
san
lorenzo
a
crooked
brown
from
which
i
should
infer
that
the
saint
was
rather
an
man
the
gilded
chapel
of
san
juan
is
in
singular
contrast
with
one
of
the
garments
which
he
wore
when
living
a
cowl
of
plaited
reeds
looking
like
an
old
fish
basket
which
is
kept
in
a
glass
case
his
portrait
is
also
to
be
seen
a
mild
and
beautiful
face
truly
that
of
one
who
went
about
doing
good
he
was
a
sort
of
spanish
john
howard
and
deserved
canonization
if
anybody
ever
did
i
ascended
the
street
of
the
darro
to
the
albaycin
which
we
entered
by
one
of
the
ancient
gates
this
suburb
is
still
surrounded
by
the
original
fortifications
and
undermined
by
the
capacious
cisterns
of
the
moors
it
looks
down
on
granada
and
from
the
crumbling
parapets
there
are
superb
views
over
the
city
the
vega
and
its
inclosing
mountains
the
alhambra
rose
opposite
against
the
and
purple
background
of
the
sierra
nevada
and
a
canopy
of
heavy
rested
on
all
the
heights
a
fitful
gleam
of
sunshine
now
and
then
broke
through
and
wandered
over
the
plain
touching
up
white
towers
and
olive
groves
and
reaches
of
the
winding
xenil
with
a
brilliancy
which
suggested
the
splendor
of
the
whole
picture
if
once
thus
restored
to
its
proper
light
i
could
see
santa
fé
in
the
distance
toward
loxa
nearer
and
more
eastward
the
sierra
de
elvira
of
a
deep
violet
color
with
the
woods
of
the
soto
de
roma
the
duke
of
wellington
estate
at
its
base
and
beyond
it
the
mountain
of
parapanda
the
of
granada
still
covered
with
clouds
there
is
an
old
granadian
proverb
which
says
when
parapanda
wears
his
bonnet
it
will
rain
whether
god
wills
it
or
no
from
the
chapel
of
san
miguel
above
the
albaycin
there
is
a
very
striking
view
of
the
deep
gorge
of
the
darro
at
one
feet
with
the
gardens
and
white
walls
of
the
generalife
rising
beyond
and
the
silla
del
moro
and
the
mountain
of
the
sun
towering
above
it
the
long
irregular
lines
of
the
alhambra
with
the
huge
red
towers
rising
here
and
there
reminded
me
somewhat
of
a
distant
view
of
karnak
and
like
karnak
the
alhambra
is
picturesque
from
whatever
point
it
is
viewed
we
descended
through
wastes
of
cactus
to
the
darro
in
whose
turbid
stream
a
group
of
men
were
washing
for
gold
i
watched
one
of
them
as
he
twirled
his
bowl
in
precisely
the
california
style
but
got
nothing
for
his
pains
mateo
says
that
they
often
make
a
dollar
a
day
each
passing
under
the
tower
of
comares
and
along
the
battlements
of
the
alhambra
we
climbed
up
to
the
generalife
this
charming
villa
is
still
in
good
preservation
though
its
exquisite
filigree
and
have
been
greatly
injured
by
whitewash
the
elegant
colonnades
surround
gardens
rich
in
roses
myrtles
and
cypresses
and
the
fountains
that
lulled
the
moorish
kings
in
their
summer
idleness
still
pour
their
fertilizing
streams
in
one
of
the
rooms
is
a
small
and
bad
portrait
gallery
containing
a
supposed
portrait
of
boabdil
it
is
a
mild
amiable
face
but
wholly
lacks
strength
of
character
i
devoted
to
the
alhambra
the
storm
which
as
the
people
say
has
not
been
equalled
for
several
years
showed
no
signs
of
breaking
up
and
in
the
midst
of
a
driving
shower
i
ascended
to
the
vermilion
towers
which
are
supposed
to
be
of
phoenician
origin
they
stand
on
the
extremity
of
a
long
narrow
ledge
which
stretches
out
like
an
arm
from
the
hill
of
the
alhambra
the
lies
between
and
is
shaded
by
beautiful
elms
which
the
moors
planted
i
entered
the
alhambra
by
the
gate
of
justice
which
is
a
fine
specimen
of
moorish
architecture
though
of
common
red
brick
and
mortar
it
is
singular
what
a
grace
the
arch
gives
to
the
most
heavy
and
lumbering
mass
of
masonry
the
round
arches
of
the
christian
edifices
of
granada
seem
tame
and
inelegant
in
comparison
over
the
arch
of
the
vestibule
of
this
gate
is
the
colossal
hand
and
over
the
inner
entrance
the
key
celebrated
in
the
tales
of
washington
irving
and
the
superstitions
of
the
people
i
first
ascended
the
torre
de
la
vela
where
the
christian
flag
was
first
planted
on
the
of
january
the
view
of
the
vega
and
city
of
granada
was
even
grander
than
from
the
albaycin
parapanda
was
still
bonneted
in
clouds
but
patches
of
blue
sky
began
to
open
above
the
mountains
of
loxa
a
little
boy
accompanied
us
to
see
that
i
did
not
pull
the
bell
the
sound
of
which
would
call
together
all
the
troops
in
the
city
while
we
stood
there
the
funeral
procession
of
the
man
murdered
two
nights
before
came
up
the
street
of
gomerez
and
passed
around
the
hill
under
the
vermilion
towers
i
made
the
circuit
of
the
walls
before
entering
the
palace
in
the
place
of
the
cisterns
i
stopped
to
take
a
drink
of
the
cool
water
of
the
darro
which
is
brought
thither
by
subterranean
channels
from
the
hills
then
passing
the
ostentatious
pile
commenced
by
charles
but
which
was
never
finished
and
never
will
be
nor
ought
to
be
we
walked
along
the
southern
ramparts
to
the
tower
of
the
seven
floors
amid
the
ruins
of
winch
i
discerned
the
top
of
the
arch
by
which
the
unfortunate
boabdil
quitted
granada
and
which
was
thenceforth
closed
for
ever
in
the
tower
of
the
infantas
a
number
of
workmen
were
busy
restoring
the
interior
which
has
been
cruelly
damaged
the
brilliant
or
the
delicate
arches
and
filigree
sculpture
of
the
walls
still
attest
its
former
elegance
and
give
some
color
to
the
tradition
that
it
was
the
residence
of
the
moorish
princesses
as
we
passed
through
the
little
village
which
still
exists
among
the
ruins
of
the
fortress
mateo
invited
me
to
step
in
and
see
his
father
the
genuine
honest
mateo
immortalized
in
the
tales
of
the
alhambra
the
old
man
has
taken
up
the
trade
of
and
had
a
number
of
ribbons
on
his
loom
he
is
more
than
sixty
years
old
and
now
quite
but
has
the
same
simple
manners
the
same
honest
face
that
attracted
his
temporary
master
he
spoke
with
great
enthusiasm
of
irving
and
brought
out
from
a
place
of
safety
the
alhambra
and
the
chronicles
of
the
conquest
which
he
has
carefully
preserved
he
then
produced
an
andalusian
sash
the
work
of
his
own
hands
which
he
insisted
on
binding
around
my
waist
to
see
how
it
would
look
i
must
next
take
off
my
coat
and
hat
and
put
on
his
sunday
jacket
and
jaunty
sombrero
he
exclaimed
buen
senor
you
are
a
legitimate
andalusian
after
this
of
course
i
could
do
no
less
than
buy
the
sash
you
must
show
it
to
washington
irving
said
he
and
tell
him
it
was
made
by
mateo
own
hands
which
i
promised
i
must
then
go
into
the
kitchen
and
eat
a
pomegranate
from
his
garden
a
glorious
pomegranate
with
kernels
of
crimson
and
so
full
of
blood
that
you
could
not
touch
them
but
it
trickled
through
your
fingers
el
marques
a
sprightly
dog
and
a
great
cat
took
possession
of
my
legs
and
begged
for
a
share
of
every
mouthful
i
took
while
old
mateo
sat
beside
me
rejoicing
in
the
flavor
of
a
gibraltar
cigar
which
i
gave
him
but
my
time
was
precious
and
so
i
let
the
son
of
the
alhambra
go
back
to
his
loom
and
set
out
for
the
palace
of
the
moorish
kings
this
palace
is
so
hidden
behind
the
ambitious
shell
of
that
of
charles
that
i
was
at
a
loss
where
it
could
be
i
thought
i
had
compassed
the
hill
and
yet
had
seen
no
indications
of
the
renowned
magnificence
of
the
alhambra
but
a
little
door
in
a
blank
wall
ushered
me
into
a
true
moorish
realm
the
court
of
the
fishpond
or
of
the
myrtles
as
it
is
sometimes
called
here
i
saw
again
the
slender
pillars
the
fringed
and
embroidered
arches
and
the
perforated
tracery
of
the
fairy
corridors
here
hedges
of
roses
and
myrtles
still
bloomed
around
the
ancient
tank
wherein
hundreds
of
disported
the
noises
of
the
hill
do
not
penetrate
here
and
the
solitary
porter
who
admitted
me
went
back
to
his
post
and
suffered
me
to
wander
at
will
through
the
enchanted
halls
i
passed
out
of
this
court
by
an
opposite
door
and
saw
through
the
vistas
of
marble
pillars
and
the
wonderful
which
seems
a
thing
of
air
rather
than
of
earth
the
fountain
of
the
lions
thence
i
entered
in
succession
the
hall
of
the
abencerrages
the
hall
of
the
two
sisters
the
apartments
of
the
sultanas
the
mosque
and
the
hall
of
the
ambassadors
these
places
all
that
is
left
of
the
renowned
palace
are
now
well
kept
and
carefully
guarded
restorations
are
going
on
here
and
there
and
the
place
is
scrupulously
watched
that
no
foreign
vandal
may
further
injure
what
the
native
goths
have
done
their
best
to
destroy
the
rubbish
has
been
cleared
away
the
rents
in
the
walls
have
been
filled
up
and
for
the
first
time
since
it
passed
into
spanish
hands
there
seems
a
hope
that
the
alhambra
will
be
allowed
to
stand
what
has
been
already
destroyed
we
can
only
partially
conjecture
but
no
one
sees
what
remains
without
completing
the
picture
in
his
own
imagination
and
placing
it
among
the
most
perfect
and
marvellous
creations
of
human
genius
nothing
can
exceed
the
richness
of
invention
which
in
this
series
of
halls
corridors
and
courts
never
repeats
the
same
ornaments
but
from
the
simplest
primitive
forms
and
colors
produces
a
thousand
combinations
not
one
of
which
is
in
discord
with
the
grand
design
it
is
useless
to
attempt
a
detailed
description
of
this
architecture
and
it
is
so
unlike
anything
else
in
the
world
that
like
karnak
and
baalbec
those
only
know
the
alhambra
who
see
it
when
you
can
weave
stone
and
hang
your
halls
with
marble
tapestry
you
may
rival
it
it
is
nothing
to
me
that
these
ornaments
are
stucco
to
sculpture
them
in
marble
is
only
the
work
of
the
hands
their
great
excellence
is
in
the
design
which
like
all
great
things
suggests
even
more
than
it
gives
if
i
could
create
all
that
the
court
of
lions
suggested
to
me
for
its
completion
it
would
fulfil
the
dream
of
king
sheddad
and
surpass
the
palaces
of
the
moslem
paradise
the
pavilions
of
the
court
of
lions
and
the
halls
which
open
into
it
on
either
side
approach
the
nearest
to
their
original
perfection
the
floors
are
marble
the
wainscoting
of
painted
tiles
the
walls
of
embroidery
still
gleaming
with
the
softened
lustre
of
their
original
tints
and
the
lofty
conical
domes
seem
to
be
huge
sparry
crystalizations
hung
with
dropping
stalactites
rather
than
any
work
of
the
human
hand
each
of
these
domes
is
composed
of
five
thousand
separate
pieces
and
the
pendent
prismatic
blocks
colored
and
gilded
gradually
resolve
themselves
as
you
gaze
into
the
most
intricate
and
elegant
designs
but
you
must
study
long
ere
you
have
won
all
the
secret
of
their
beauty
to
comprehend
them
one
should
spend
a
whole
day
lying
on
his
back
under
each
one
mateo
spread
his
cloak
for
me
in
the
fountain
in
the
hall
of
the
abencerrages
over
the
made
by
the
decapitation
of
those
gallant
chiefs
and
i
lay
half
an
hour
looking
upward
and
this
is
what
i
made
out
of
the
dome
from
its
central
pinnacle
hung
the
chalice
of
a
flower
with
feathery
petals
like
the
crape
myrtle
of
our
southern
states
outside
of
this
branched
downward
the
eight
rays
of
a
large
star
whose
points
touched
the
base
of
the
dome
yet
the
star
was
itself
composed
of
flowers
while
between
its
rays
and
around
its
points
fell
a
shower
of
blossoms
shells
and
sparry
drops
from
the
base
of
the
dome
hung
a
gorgeous
pattern
of
lace
with
a
fringe
of
bugles
projecting
into
eight
points
so
as
to
form
a
star
of
drapery
hanging
from
the
points
of
the
flowery
star
in
the
dome
the
spaces
between
the
angles
were
filled
with
masses
of
stalactites
dropping
one
below
the
other
till
they
tapered
into
the
plain
square
sides
of
the
hall
in
the
hall
of
the
two
sisters
i
lay
likewise
for
a
considerable
time
resolving
its
misty
glories
into
shape
the
dome
was
still
more
suggestive
of
flowers
the
highest
and
central
piece
was
a
deep
whose
mouth
was
cleft
into
eight
petals
it
hung
in
the
centre
of
a
superb
the
leaves
of
which
were
exquisitely
veined
and
chased
still
further
below
swung
a
mass
of
mimosa
blossoms
intermixed
with
pods
and
leaves
and
around
the
base
of
the
dome
opened
the
bells
of
sixteen
gorgeous
tulips
these
pictures
may
not
be
very
intelligible
but
i
know
not
how
else
to
paint
the
effect
of
this
fairy
architecture
in
granada
as
in
seville
and
cordova
one
sympathies
are
wholly
with
the
moors
the
few
mutilated
traces
which
still
remain
of
their
power
taste
and
refinement
surpass
any
of
the
monuments
erected
by
the
race
which
conquered
them
the
moorish
dynasty
in
spain
was
truly
as
irving
observes
a
splendid
exotic
doomed
never
to
take
a
lasting
root
in
the
soil
it
was
choked
to
death
by
the
native
weeds
and
in
place
of
lands
richly
cultivated
and
teeming
with
plenty
we
now
have
barren
depopulated
wastes
in
place
of
education
industry
and
the
cultivation
of
the
arts
and
sciences
an
enslaved
ignorant
and
degenerate
race
andalusia
would
be
far
more
prosperous
at
this
day
had
she
remained
in
moslem
hands
true
she
would
not
have
received
that
faith
which
is
yet
destined
to
be
the
redemption
of
the
world
but
the
doctrines
of
mahomet
are
more
acceptable
to
god
and
more
beneficial
to
man
than
those
of
that
inquisition
which
in
spain
alone
has
shed
ten
times
as
much
christian
blood
as
all
the
moslem
races
together
for
the
last
six
centuries
it
is
not
from
a
mere
romantic
interest
that
i
lament
the
fate
of
boabdil
and
the
extinction
of
his
dynasty
had
he
been
a
king
worthy
to
reign
in
those
wonderful
halls
he
never
would
have
left
them
had
he
perished
there
fighting
to
the
last
he
would
have
been
freed
from
forty
years
of
weary
exile
and
an
obscure
death
well
did
charles
observe
when
speaking
of
him
better
a
tomb
in
the
alhambra

a

fell

and

they

in

to
give
the
full

and
beauty
mateo
procured
me
a
bottle
of
and
we
drank
it
together
in
the
court
of
lions
six
hours
had
passed
away
before
i
knew
it
and
i
reluctantly
prepared
to
leave
the
clouds
by
this
time
had
disappeared
the
vega
slept
in
brilliant
sunshine
and
the
peaks
of
the
sierra
nevada
shone
white
and
cold
against
the
sky
on
reaching
the
hotel
i
found
a
little
man
nicknamed
napoleon
awaiting
me
he
was
desirous
to
furnish
me
with
horses
and
having
a
prophetic
knowledge
of
the
weather
promised
me
a
bright
sky
as
far
as
gibraltar
i
furnish
all
the
señors
said
he
they
know
me
and
never
complain
of
me
or
my
horses
but
by
way
of
security
on
making
the
bargain
i
threatened
to
put
up
a
card
in
the
hotel
at
gibraltar
warning
all
travellers
against
him
in
case
i
was
not
satisfied
my
contract
was
for
two
horses
and
a
guide
who
were
to
be
ready
at
sunrise
the
next
morning
napoleon
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
before
i
had
finished
an
early
cup
of
chocolate
there
was
a
little
black
andalusian
stallion
awaiting
me
the
or
of
the
guide
were
strengthened
by
a
stock
of
cold
provisions
the
leathern
bota
hanging
beside
it
was
filled
with
ripe
granada
wine
and
now
behold
me
ambling
over
the
vega
accoutred
in
a
gay
andalusian
jacket
a
sash
woven
by
mateo
ximenes
and
one
of
those
bandboxy
sombreros
which
i
at
first
thought
so
ungainly
but
now
consider
quite
picturesque
and
elegant
my
guide
a
short
but
sinewy
and
son
of
the
mountains
named
josé
garcia
set
off
at
a
canter
down
the
banks
of
the
darro
do
ride
so
fast
cried
napoleon
who
watched
our
setting
out
from
the
door
of
the
fonda
but
josé
was
already
out
of
hearing
this
guide
is
a
companion
to
my
liking
although
he
is
only
he
has
been
for
a
number
of
years
a
or
and
a
guide
for
travelling
parties
his
olive
complexion
is
made
still
darker
by
exposure
to
the
sun
and
wind
and
his
eyes
shine
with
southern
heat
and
fire
he
has
one
of
those
rare
mouths
which
are
born
with
a
broad
smile
in
each
corner
and
which
seem
to
laugh
even
in
the
midst
of
grief
we
had
not
been
two
hours
together
before
i
knew
his
history
from
beginning
to
end
he
had
already
been
married
eight
years
and
his
only
trouble
was
a
debt
of
dollars
which
the
illness
of
his
wife
had
caused
him
this
money
was
owing
to
the
pawnbroker
who
kept
his
best
clothes
in
pledge
until
he
could
pay
it
señor
said
he
if
i
had
ten
million
dollars
i
would
rather
give
them
all
away
than
have
a
sick
wife
he
had
a
brother
in
puerto
principe
cuba
who
sent
over
money
enough
to
pay
the
rent
of
the
house
but
he
found
that
children
were
a
great
expense
it
is
most
astonishing
he
said
how
much
children
can
eat
from
morning
till
night
the
bread
is
never
out
of
their
mouths
josé
has
recently
been
travelling
with
some
spaniards
one
of
whom
made
him
pay
two
dollars
for
an
umbrella
which
was
lost
on
the
road
this
umbrella
is
a
thorn
in
his
side
at
every
venta
where
we
stop
the
story
is
repeated
and
he
is
not
sparing
of
his
maledictions
the
ghost
of
that
umbrella
is
continually
raised
and
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
he
can
shut
it
one
reason
why
i
like
to
travel
with
foreign
señors
said
he
to
me
is
that
when
i
lose
anything
they
never
make
me
pay
for
it
for
all
that
i
answered
take
care
you
do
lose
my
umbrella
it
cost
three
dollars
since
then
nothing
can
exceed
josé
attention
to
that
article
he
is
at
his
wit
end
how
to
secure
it
best
it
appears
sometimes
before
sometimes
behind
him
lashed
to
the
saddle
with
innumerable
cords
now
he
sticks
it
into
the
alforja
now
carries
it
in
his
hand
and
i
verily
believe
that
he
sleeps
with
it
in
his
arms
every
evening
as
he
tells
his
story
to
the
muleteers
around
the
kitchen
fire
he
always
winds
up
by
triumphantly
appealing
to
me
with
well
señor
have
i
lost
umbrella
yet
our
bargain
is
that
i
shall
feed
him
on
the
way
and
as
we
travel
in
the
primitive
style
of
the
country
we
always
sit
down
together
to
the
same
dish
to
his
supervision
the
olla
is
often
indebted
for
an
additional
flavor
and
no
gentleman
could
behave
at
table
with
more
ease
and
propriety
he
is
as
moderate
as
a
bedouin
in
his
wants
and
never
touches
the
burning
aguardiente
which
the
muleteers
are
accustomed
to
drink
i
asked
him
the
reason
of
this
i
drink
wine
senor
he
replied
because
that
you
know
is
like
meat
and
bread
but
i
have
made
a
vow
never
to
drink
aguardiente
again
two
of
us
got
drunk
on
it
four
or
five
years
ago
in
granada
and
we
quarrelled
my
comrade
drew
his
knife
and
stabbed
me
here
in
the
left
shoulder
i
was
furious
and
cut
him
across
the
breast
we
both
went
to
the
hospital
i
for
three
months
and
he
for
six
and
he
died
in
a
few
days
after
getting
out
it
cost
my
poor
father
many
a
thousand
reals
and
when
i
was
able
to
go
to
work
i
vowed
before
the
virgin
that
i
would
never
touch
aguardiente
again
for
the
first
league
our
road
lay
over
the
rich
vega
of
granada
but
gradually
became
wilder
and
more
waste
passing
the
long
desert
ridge
known
as
the
last
sigh
of
the
moor
we
struck
across
a
region
of
low
hills
the
road
was
very
deep
from
the
recent
rains
and
studded
at
short
intervals
by
rude
crosses
erected
to
persons
who
had
been
murdered
josé
took
a
grim
delight
in
giving
me
the
history
of
each
beyond
the
village
of
lamala
which
lies
with
its
in
a
basin
of
the
hills
we
ascended
the
mountain
ridge
which
forms
the
southern
boundary
of
the
vega
granada
nearly
twenty
miles
distant
was
still
visible
the
alhambra
was
dwindled
to
a
speck
and
i
took
my
last
view
of
it
and
the
magnificent
landscape
which
lies
spread
out
before
it
the
sierra
nevada
rising
to
the
height
of
feet
above
the
sea
was
perfectly
free
from
clouds
and
the
whole
range
was
visible
at
one
glance
all
its
chasms
were
filled
with
snow
and
for
nearly
down
its
sides
there
was
not
a
speck
of
any
other
color
its
summits
were
almost
wholly
devoid
of
shadow
and
their
notched
and
jagged
outlines
rested
flatly
against
the
sky
like
ivory
inlaid
on
a
table
of
from
these
waste
hills
we
descended
into
the
valley
of
cacia
whose
river
had
been
so
swollen
by
the
rains
that
the
from
malaga
had
only
succeeded
in
passing
it
that
morning
we
forded
it
without
accident
and
crossing
a
loftier
and
bleaker
range
came
down
into
the
valley
of
the
marchan
high
on
a
cliff
over
the
stream
stood
alhama
my
for
the
night
the
natural
warm
baths
on
account
of
which
this
spot
was
so
beloved
by
the
moors
are
still
resorted
to
in
the
summer
they
lie
in
the
bosom
of
a
deep
and
rugged
gorge
half
a
mile
further
down
the
river
the
town
occupies
the
crest
of
a
narrow
promontory
bounded
on
all
sides
but
one
by
tremendous
precipices
it
is
one
of
the
most
picturesque
spots
imaginable
and
reminded
me
to
continue
the
comparison
between
syria
and
andalusia
which
i
find
so
striking
of
the
gorge
of
the
barrada
near
damascus
alhama
is
now
a
poor
insignificant
town
only
visited
by
artists
and
muleteers
the
population
wear
long
brown
cloaks
and
slouched
hats
like
the
natives
of
la
mancha
i
found
tolerable
quarters
in
a
house
on
the
plaza
and
took
the
remaining
hour
of
daylight
to
view
the
town
the
people
looked
at
me
with
curiosity
and
some
boys
walking
on
the
edge
of
the
or
precipice
threw
over
stones
that
i
might
see
how
deep
it
was
the
rock
in
some
places
quite
overhung
the
bed
of
the
marchan
which
its
base
the
close
scrutiny
to
which
i
was
subjected
by
the
crowd
in
the
plaza
called
to
mind
all
i
had
heard
of
spanish
spies
and
robbers
at
the
venta
i
was
well
treated
but
received
such
an
exorbitant
bill
in
the
morning
that
i
was
ready
to
exclaim
with
king
boabdil
woe
is
me
alhama
on
comparing
notes
with
josé
i
found
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
pay
in
addition
for
what
he
received
a
discovery
which
so
exasperated
that
worthy
that
he
folded
his
hands
bowed
his
head
made
three
kisses
in
the
air
and
cried
out
i
swear
before
the
virgin
that
i
will
never
again
take
a
traveller
to
that
inn
we
left
alhama
an
hour
before
daybreak
for
we
had
a
rough
journey
of
more
than
forty
miles
before
us
the
was
barely
visible
in
the
darkness
but
we
continued
ascending
to
a
height
of
probably
feet
above
the
sea
and
thus
met
the
sunrise
crossing
the
of
ace
faraya
we
reached
a
tremendous
natural
portal
in
the
mountains
from
whence
as
from
a
door
we
looked
down
on
all
the
country
lying
between
us
and
the
sea
the
valley
of
the
river
vélez
winding
among
the
hills
pointed
out
the
course
of
our
road
on
the
left
towered
over
us
the
barren
sierra
tejeda
an
isolated
group
of
peaks
about
feet
in
height
for
miles
the
road
was
a
rocky
ladder
which
we
scrambled
down
on
foot
leading
our
horses
the
vegetation
gradually
became
of
a
warmer
and
more
luxuriant
cast
the
southern
slopes
were
planted
with
the
vine
that
produces
the
famous
malaga
raisins
and
the
orange
groves
in
the
sunny
depths
of
the
valleys
were
as
yellow
as
autumnal
beeches
with
their
enormous
loads
of
fruit
as
the
bells
of
vélez
malaga
were
ringing
noon
we
emerged
from
the
mountains
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
rode
into
the
town
to
breakfast
we
halted
at
a
queer
old
inn
more
like
a
turkish
khan
than
a
christian
hostlery
it
was
kept
by
a
fat
landlady
who
made
us
an
olla
of
kid
and
garlic
which
with
some
coarse
bread
and
the
red
malaga
wine
soon
took
off
the
sharp
edge
of
our
mountain
appetites
while
i
was
washing
my
hands
at
a
well
in
the
the
noticed
the
of
jerusalem
which
is
stamped
indelibly
on
my
left
arm
his
admiration
and
reverence
were
so
great
that
he
called
the
fat
landlady
who
on
learning
that
it
had
been
made
in
jerusalem
and
that
i
had
visited
the
holy
sepulchre
summoned
her
children
to
see
it
here
my
children
she
said
cross
yourselves
kneel
down
and
kiss
this
holy
seal
for
as
long
as
you
live
you
may
never
see
the
like
of
it
again
thus
i
a
protestant
heretic
became
a
catholic
shrine
the
children
knelt
and
kissed
my
arm
with
touching
simplicity
and
the
seal
will
henceforth
be
more
sacred
to
me
than
ever
the
remaining
twenty
miles
or
more
of
the
road
to
malaga
follow
the
line
of
the
coast
passing
headlands
crowned
by
the
or
of
the
moors
it
is
a
new
road
and
practicable
for
carriages
so
that
for
spain
it
may
be
considered
an
important
achievement
the
late
rains
have
however
already
undermined
it
in
a
number
of
places
here
as
among
the
mountains
we
met
crowds
of
muleteers
all
of
whom
greeted
me
with
usted
con
dios
may
you
go
with
god
cavalier
by
this
time
all
my
forgotten
spanish
had
come
back
again
and
a
little
experience
of
the
simple
ways
of
the
people
made
me
quite
at
home
among
them
in
almost
every
instance
i
was
treated
precisely
as
a
spaniard
would
have
been
and
less
annoyed
by
the
curiosity
of
the
natives
than
i
have
been
in
germany
and
even
america
we
were
still
two
leagues
from
malaga
at
sunset
the
fishermen
along
the
coast
were
hauling
in
their
nets
and
we
soon
began
to
overtake
companies
of
them
carrying
their
fish
to
the
city
on
donkeys
one
stout
strapping
fellow
with
flesh
as
hard
and
yellow
as
a
sturgeon
was
seated
sideways
on
a
very
small
donkey
between
two
immense
panniers
of
fish
as
he
trotted
before
us
shouting
and
slapping
the
flanks
of
the
sturdy
little
beast
josé
and
i
began
to
laugh
whereupon
the
fellow
broke
out
into
the
following
monologue
addressed
to
the
donkey
who
laughs
at
this
who
says
he
not
fine
gold
from
head
to
foot
what
is
it
that
he
ca
do
if
there
was
a
mountain
ever
so
high
he
would
gallop
over
it
if
there
was
a
river
ever
so
deep
he
would
swim
through
it
if
he
could
but
speak
i
might
send
him
to
market
alone
with
the
fish
and
not
a
of
the
money
would
he
spend
on
the
way
home
who
says
he
ca
go
as
far
as
that
limping
horse
arrrre
burrico
punate
we
reached
malaga
at
last
our
horses
sorely
fagged
at
the
fonda
de
la
alameda
a
new
and
very
elegant
hotel
i
found
a
bath
and
a
good
dinner
both
welcome
things
to
a
tired
traveller
the
winter
of
malaga
is
like
spring
in
other
lands
and
on
that
account
it
is
much
visited
by
invalids
especially
english
it
is
a
lively
commercial
town
of
about
inhabitants
and
if
the
present
scheme
of
railroad
communication
with
madrid
is
carried
out
must
continue
to
increase
in
size
and
importance
a
number
of
manufacturing
establishments
have
lately
been
started
and
in
this
department
it
bids
fair
to
rival
barcelona
the
harbor
is
small
but
good
and
the
country
around
rich
in
all
the
productions
of
temperate
and
even
tropical
climates
the
city
contains
little
to
interest
the
tourist
i
visited
the
cathedral
an
immense
unfinished
mass
without
a
particle
of
architectural
taste
outwardly
though
the
interior
has
a
fine
effect
from
its
large
dimensions
at
noon
we
were
again
in
the
saddle
and
took
the
road
to
the
baths
of
caratraca
the
tall
factory
chimneys
of
malaga
vomiting
forth
streams
of
black
smoke
marred
the
serenity
of
the
sky
but
the
distant
view
of
the
city
is
very
fine
the
broad
vega
watered
by
the
guadaljorce
is
rich
and
well
cultivated
and
now
rejoices
in
the
verdure
of
spring
the
meadows
are
clothed
with
fresh
grass
and
daisies
are
in
blossom
and
larks
sing
in
the
now
and
then
we
passed
a
del
with
its
front
half
buried
in
over
which
towered
two
or
three
sentinel
palms
after
two
leagues
of
this
delightful
travel
the
country
became
more
hilly
and
the
groups
of
mountains
which
inclosed
us
assumed
the
most
picturesque
and
enchanting
forms
the
soft
haze
in
which
the
distant
peaks
were
bathed
the
lovely
violet
shadows
filling
up
their
chasms
and
gorges
and
the
fresh
meadows
vineyards
and
olive
groves
below
made
the
landscape
one
of
the
most
beautiful
i
have
seen
in
spain
as
we
were
trotting
along
through
the
palmetto
thickets
josé
asked
me
if
i
should
not
like
to
hear
an
andalusian
story
nothing
would
please
me
better
i
replied
ride
close
beside
me
then
said
he
that
you
may
understand
every
word
of
it
i
complied
and
he
gave
me
the
following
just
as
i
repeat
it
there
was
once
a
very
rich
man
who
had
thousands
of
cattle
in
the
sierra
nevada
and
hundreds
of
houses
in
the
city
well
this
man
put
a
plate
with
his
name
on
it
on
the
door
of
the
great
house
in
which
he
lived
and
the
name
was
this
don
pedro
without
fear
and
without
care
now
when
the
king
was
making
his
he
happened
to
ride
by
this
house
in
his
carriage
and
saw
the
plate
on
the
door
me
the
name
on
that
plate
said
he
to
his
officer
then
the
officer
read
the
name
don
pedro
without
fear
and
without
care
will
see
whether
don
pedro
is
without
fear
and
without
care
said
the
king
the
next
day
came
a
messenger
to
the
house
and
when
he
saw
don
pedro
said
he
to
him
pedro
without
fear
and
without
care
the
king
wants
you
does
the
king
want
with
me
said
don
pedro
sends
you
four
questions
which
you
must
answer
within
four
days
or
he
will
have
you
shot
and
the
questions
are
how
can
the
sierra
nevada
be
cleared
of
snow
how
can
the
sea
be
made
smaller
how
many
arrobas
does
the
moon
weigh
and
how
many
leagues
from
here
to
the
land
of
heavenly
glory
then
don
pedro
without
fear
and
without
care
began
to
sweat
from
fright
and
knew
not
what
he
should
do
he
called
some
of
his
arrieros
and
loaded
twenty
mules
with
money
and
went
up
into
the
sierra
nevada
where
his
herdsmen
tended
his
flocks
for
as
i
said
he
had
many
thousand
cattle
keep
you
my
master
said
the
chief
herdsman
who
was
young
and
and
had
as
good
a
head
as
ever
was
set
on
two
shoulders
hombre
said
don
pedro
am
a
dead
man
and
so
he
told
the
herdsman
all
that
the
king
had
said
is
that
all
said
the
knowing
mozo
can
get
you
out
of
the
scrape
let
me
go
and
answer
the
questions
in
your
name
my
master
you
fool
what
can
you
do
said
don
pedro
without
fear
and
without
care
throwing
himself
upon
the
earth
and
ready
to
die
but
nevertheless
the
herdsman
dressed
himself
up
as
a
went
down
to
the
city
and
on
the
fourth
day
presented
himself
at
the
palace
do
you
want
said
the
officers
am
don
pedro
without
fear
and
without
care
come
to
answer
the
questions
which
the
king
sent
to
me
said
the
king
when
he
was
brought
before
him
me
hear
your
answers
or
i
will
have
you
shot
this
day
majesty
said
the
herdsman
think
i
can
do
it
if
you
were
to
set
a
million
of
children
to
playing
among
the
snow
of
the
sierra
nevada
they
would
soon
clear
it
all
away
and
if
you
were
to
dig
a
ditch
as
wide
and
as
deep
as
all
spain
you
would
make
the
sea
that
much
smaller
said
the
king
makes
only
two
questions
there
are
two
more
yet
think
i
can
answer
those
also
said
the
herdsman
moon
contains
four
quarters
and
therefore
weighs
only
one
arroba
and
as
for
the
last
question
it
is
not
even
a
single
league
to
the
land
of
heavenly
glory
for
if
your
majesty
were
to
die
after
breakfast
you
would
get
there
before
you
had
an
appetite
for
dinner
done
said
the
king
and
he
then
made
him
count
and
marquez
and
i
do
know
how
many
other
titles
in
the
meantime
don
pedro
without
fear
and
without
care
had
died
of
his
fright
and
as
he
left
no
family
the
herdsman
took
possession
of
all
his
estates
and
until
the
day
of
his
death
was
called
don
pedro
without
fear
and
without
care
i
write
sitting
by
the
grated
window
of
this
lonely
inn
looking
out
on
the
meadows
of
the
guadaljorce
the
chain
of
mountains
which
rises
to
the
west
of
malaga
is
purpled
by
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
and
the
houses
and
castle
of
carlama
hang
on
its
side
in
full
view
further
to
the
right
i
see
the
smoke
of
monda
where
one
of
the
greatest
battles
of
antiquity
was
fought
that
which
overthrew
the
sons
of

and

the
mozo

busy
preparing
my
kid

and
josé
is
at
his
elbow
gently
suggesting
ingredients
which
may
give
the
dish
a
richer
flavor
the
landscape
is
softened
by
the
hush
of
coming
evening
a
few
birds
are
still
twittering
among
the
bushes
and
the
grows
whiter
and
clearer
in
the
people
about
me
are
humble
but
appear
honest
and
peaceful
and
nothing
indicates
that

i
passed
an
uncomfortable
night
at
the
venta
de
villalon
lying
upon
a
bag
stuffed
with
equal
quantities
of
wool
and
fleas
starting
before
dawn
we
followed
a
path
which
led
into
the
mountains
where
herdsmen
and
boys
were
taking
out
their
sheep
and
goats
to
pasture
then
it
descended
into
the
valley
of
a
stream
bordered
with
rich
i
never
saw
the
orange
in
a
more
flourishing
state
we
passed
several
orchards
of
trees
thirty
feet
high
and
every
bough
and
twig
so
completely
laden
with
fruit
that
the
foliage
was
hardly
to
be
seen
at
the
venta
del
vicario
we
found
a
number
of
soldiers
just
setting
out
for
ronda
they
appeared
to
be
escorting
a
convoy
of
goods
for
there
were
twenty
or
thirty
laden
mules
gathered
at
the
door
we
now
ascended
a
most
difficult
and
stony
path
winding
through
bleak
wastes
of
gray
rock
till
we
reached
a
lofty
pass
in
the
mountain
range
the
wind
swept
through
the
narrow
gateway
with
a
force
that
almost
unhorsed
us
from
the
other
side
a
sublime
but
most
desolate
landscape
opened
to
my
view
opposite
at
ten
miles
distance
rose
a
lofty
ridge
of
naked
rock
overhung
with
clouds
the
country
between
was
a
chaotic
jumble
of
stony
hills
separated
by
deep
chasms
with
just
a
green
patch
here
and
there
to
show
that
it
was
not
entirely
forsaken
by
man
nevertheless
as
we
descended
into
it
we
found
valleys
with
vineyards
and
olive
groves
which
were
invisible
from
above
as
we
were
both
getting
hungry
josé
stopped
at
a
ventorillo
and
ordered
two
cups
of
wine
for
which
he
insisted
on
paying
if
i
had
as
many
horses
as
my
master
napoleon
said
he
i
would
regale
the
señors
whenever
i
travelled
with
them
i
would
have
and
sweetmeats
with
plenty
of
malaga
or
valdepeñas
in
the
bota
and
they
should
never
complain
of
their
fare
part
of
our
road
was
studded
with
gray
at
a
distance
hardly
to
be
distinguished
from
olives
and
josé
dismounted
to
gather
the
mast
which
was
as
sweet
and
palatable
as
chestnuts
with
very
little
of
the
bitter
quercine
flavor
at
eleven
we
reached
el
burgo
so
called
probably
from
its
ancient
moorish
fortress
it
is
a
poor
starved
village
built
on
a
barren
hill
over
a
stream
which
is
still
spanned
by
a
lofty
moorish
bridge
of
a
single
arch
the
remaining
three
leagues
to
ronda
were
exceedingly
rough
and
difficult
climbing
a
barren
ascent
of
nearly
a
league
in
length
we
reached
the
del
or
gate
of
the
wind
through
which
drove
such
a
current
that
we
were
obliged
to
dismount
and
even
then
it
required
all
my
strength
to
move
against
it
the
peaks
around
far
and
near
faced
with
precipitous
cliffs
wore
the
most
savage
and
forbidding
aspect
in
fact
this
region
is
almost
a
counterpart
of
the
wilderness
lying
between
jerusalem
and
the
dead
sea
very
soon
we
touched
the
skirt
of
a
cloud
and
were
enveloped
in
masses
of
chill
whirling
vapor
through
which
we
travelled
for
three
or
four
miles
to
a
similar
gate
on
the
western
side
of
the
chain
descending
again
we
emerged
into
a
clearer
atmosphere
and
saw
below
us
a
wide
extent
of
mountain
country
but
of
a
more
fertile
and
cheerful
character
olive
orchards
and
now
appeared
and
at
four
we
rode
into
the
streets
of
ronda
no
town
can
surpass
this
in
the
grandeur
and
picturesqueness
of
its
position
it
is
built
on
the
edge
of
a
broad
shelf
of
the
mountains
which
falls
away
in
a
sheer
precipice
of
from
six
to
eight
hundred
feet
in
height
and
from
the
windows
of
many
of
the
houses
you
can
look
down
the
dizzy
abyss
this
shelf
again
is
divided
in
the
centre
by
a
tremendous
chasm
three
hundred
feet
wide
and
from
four
to
six
hundred
feet
in
depth
in
the
bed
of
which
roars
the
guadalvin
boiling
in
foaming
whirlpools
or
leaping
in
sparkling
cascades
till
it
reaches
the
valley
below
the
town
lies
on
both
sides
of
the
chasm
which
is
spanned
by
a
stone
bridge
of
a
single
arch
with
abutments
nearly
four
hundred
feet
in
height
the
view
of
this
wonderful
cleft
either
from
above
or
below
is
one
of
the
finest
of
its
kind
in
the
world
honda
is
as
far
superior
to
tivoli
as
tivoli
is
to
a
dutch
village
on
the
dead
levels
of
holland
the
panorama
which
it
commands
is
on
the
grandest
scale
the
valley
below
is
a
garden
of
fruit
and
vines
bold
yet
cultivated
hills
succeed
and
in
the
distance
rise
the
lofty
summits
of
another
chain
of
the
serrania
de
honda
were
these
sublime
cliffs
these
charming
cascades
of
the
guadalvin
and
this
daring
bridge
in
italy
instead
of
in
spain
they
would
be
sketched
and
painted
every
day
in
the
year
but
i
have
yet
to
know
where
a
good
picture
of
ronda
may
be
found
in
the
bottom
of
the
chasm
are
a
number
of
as
old
as
the
time
of
the
moors
the
water
gushing
out
from
the
arches
of
one
drives
the
wheel
of
that
below
so
that
a
single
race
supplies
them
all
i
descended
by
a
very
steep
path
nearly
to
the
bottom
on
a
little
point
or
promontory
overhanging
the
black
depths
there
is
a
moorish
gateway
still
standing
the
sunset
threw
a
lovely
glow
over
the
brown
cliffs
and
the
airy
town
above
but
they
were
far
grander
when
the
cascades
glittered
in
the
moonlight
and
the
gulf
out
of
which
they
leap
was
lost
in
profound
shadow
the
window
of
my
hung
over
the
chasm
honda
was
wrapped
in
fog
when
josé
awoke
me
on
the
morning
of
the
as
we
had
but
about
miles
to
ride
that
day
we
did
not
leave
until
sunrise
we
rode
across
the
bridge
through
the
old
town
and
down
the
hill
passing
the
triple
lines
of
the
moorish
walls
by
the
original
gateways
the
road
stony
and
rugged
beyond
measure
now
took
to
the
mountains
from
the
opposite
height
there
was
a
fine
view
of
the
town
perched
like
an
eagle
nest
on
the
verge
of
its
tremendous
cliffs
but
a
curtain
of
rain
soon
fell
before
it
and
the
dense
dark
clouds
settled
around
us
and
filled
up
the
gorges
on
either
hand
hour
after
hour
we
toiled
along
the
slippery
paths
scaling
the
high
ridges
by
rocky
ladders
up
which
our
horses
climbed
with
the
greatest
difficulty
the
scenery
whenever
i
could
obtain
a
misty
glimpse
of
it
was
sublime
lofty
mountain
ridges
rose
on
either
hand
bleak
jagged
summits
of
naked
rock
pierced
the
clouds
and
the
deep
chasms
which
separated
them
sank
far
below
us
dark
and
indistinct
through
the
rain
sometimes
i
caught
sight
of
a
little
hamlet
hanging
on
some
almost
inaccessible
ledge
the
home
of
the
lawless
mountaineers
who
inhabit
this
wild
region
the
faces
of
those
we
met
exhibited
marked
traces
of
their
moslem
ancestry
especially
in
the
eye
and
the
dusky
olive
complexion
their
dialect
retains
many
oriental
forms
of
expression
and
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
at
finding
the
arabic
yes
in
general
use
instead
of
the
spanish
about
eleven
we
reached
the
rude
village
of
atajate
where
we
procured
a
very
good
breakfast
of
kid
eggs
and
white
ronda
wine
the
wind
and
rain
increased
but
i
had
no
time
to
lose
as
every
hour
swelled
the
mountain
floods
and
made
the
journey
more
difficult
this
district
is
in
the
worst
repute
of
any
in
spain
it
is
a
very
nest
of
robbers
and
contrabandistas
at
the
venta
in
atajate
they
urged
us
to
take
a
guard
but
my
valiant
josé
declared
that
he
had
never
taken
one
and
yet
was
never
robbed
so
i
trusted
to
his
good
luck
the
weather
however
was
our
best
protection
in
such
a
driving
rain
we
could
bid
defiance
to
the
flint
locks
of
their
escopettes
if
indeed
any
could
be
found
so
fond
of
their
trade
as
to
ply
it
in
a
storm
wherein
the
bear
would
crouch
the
lion
and
the
wolf
keep
their
furs
dry
nevertheless
i
noticed
that
each
of
the
few
convoys
of
laden
mules
which
we
met
had
one
or
more
of
the
accompanying
it
besides
these
the
only
persons
abroad
were
some
individuals
armed
to
the
teeth
and
muffled
in
long
cloaks
towards
whom
as
they
passed
josé
would
give
his
head
a
slight
toss
and
whisper
to
me
more
contrabandistas
we
were
soon
in
a
condition
to
defy
the
weather
the
rain
beat
furiously
in
our
faces
especially
when
threading
the
passes
between
the
higher
peaks
i
raised
my
umbrella
as
a
defence
but
the
first
blast
snapped
it
in
twain
the
were
veined
with
rills
roaring
downward
into
the
hollows
and
smaller
rills
soon
began
to
trickle
down
my
own
sides
during
the
last
part
of
our
way
the
path
was
notched
along
precipitous
steeps
where
the
storm
was
so
thick
that
we
could
see
nothing
either
above
or
below
it
was
like
riding
along
the
outer
edge
of
the
world
when
once
you
are
thoroughly
wet
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
know
that
you
can
be
no
wetter
and
so
josé
and
i
went
forward
in
the
best
possible
humor
finding
so
much
diversion
in
our
plight
that
the
dreary
leagues
were
considerably
shortened
at
the
venta
of
gaucin
where
we
stopped
the
people
received
us
kindly
the
house
consisted
of
one
room
stable
kitchen
and
all
in
one
there
was
a
small
apartment
in
a
windy
loft
where
a
bed
much
too
short
was
prepared
for
me
a
fire
of
dry
heather
was
made
in
the
wide
and
the
ruddy
flames
with
a
change
of
clothing
and
a
draught
of
the
amber
vintage
of
estepona
soon
thawed
out
the
chill
of
the
journey
but
i
received
news
which
caused
me
a
great
deal
of
anxiety
the
river
guadiaro
was
so
high
that
nobody
could
cross
and
two
forlorn
muleteers
had
been
waiting
eight
days
at
the
inn
for
the
waters
to
subside
augmented
by
the
rain
which
had
fallen
and
which
seemed
to
increase
as
night
came
on
how
could
i
hope
to
cross
it
on
the
morrow
in
two
days
the
india
steamer
would
be
at
gibraltar
my
passage
was
already
taken
and
i
be
there
the
matter
was
discussed
for
some
time
it
was
pronounced
impossible
to
travel
by
the
usual
road
but
the
landlord
knew
a
path
among
the
hills
which
led
to
a
ferry
on
the
guadiaro
where
there
was
a
boat
and
from
thence
we
could
make
our
way
to
san
roque
which
is
in
sight
of
gibraltar
he
demanded
rather
a
large
fee
for
accompanying
me
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
josé
and
i
sat
down
in
great
tribulation
to
our
accustomed
olla
but
neither
of
us
could
do
justice
to
it
and
the
greater
part
gladdened
the
landlord
two
boys
beautiful
little
imps
with
faces
like
murillo
cherubs
nevertheless
i
passed
rather
a
merry
evening
chatting
with
some
of
the
villagers
over
a
brazier
of
coals
and
one
of
the
aforesaid
boys
who
although
only
eight
years
old
already
performed
the
duties
of
mozo
lighted
me
to
my
loft
when
he
had
put
down
the
lamp
he
tried
the
door
and
asked
me
have
you
the
key
no
said
i
i
do
want
one
i
am
not
afraid
but
he
rejoined
perhaps
you
may
get
afraid
in
the
night
and
if
you
do
strike
on
this
part
of
the
wall
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
sleep
on
that
side
i
willingly
promised
to
call
him
to
my
aid
if
i
should
get
alarmed
i
slept
but
little
for
the
wind
was
howling
around
the
tiles
over
my
head
and
i
was
busy
with
plans
for
constructing
rafts
and
swimming
currents
with
a
rope
around
my
waist
finally
i
found
a
little
oblivion
but
it
seemed
that
i
had
scarcely
closed
my
eyes
when
josé
pushed
open
the
door
thanks
be
to
god
senor
said
he
it
begins
to
dawn
and
the
sky
is
clear
we
shall
certainly
get
to
gibraltar
the
landlord
was
ready
so
we
took
some
bread
and
a
basket
of
olives
and
set
out
at
once
leaving
gaucin
we
commenced
descending
the
mountain
staircase
by
which
the
serrania
of
ronda
is
scaled
on
the
side
towards
gibraltar
the
road
says
ford
seems
made
by
the
evil
one
in
a
hanging
garden
of
eden
after
four
miles
of
frightfully
rugged
descent
we
reached
an
orange
grove
on
the
banks
of
the
xenar
and
then
took
a
wild
path
leading
along
the
hills
on
the
right
of
the
stream
we
overtook
a
few
muleteers
who
were
tempted
out
by
the
fine
weather
and
before
long
the
or
from
ronda
to
san
roque
joined
us
after
eight
miles
more
of
toilsome
travel
we
reached
the
valley
of
the
guadiaro
the
river
was
not
more
than
twenty
yards
wide
flowing
with
a
deep
strong
current
between
high
banks
two
ropes
were
stretched
across
and
a
large
clumsy
boat
was
moored
to
the
shore
we
called
to
the
ferrymen
but
they
hesitated
saying
that
nobody
had
yet
been
able
to
cross
however
we
all
got
in
with
our
horses
and
two
of
the
men
with
much
reluctance
drew
us
over
the
current
was
very
powerful
although
the
river
had
fallen
a
little
during
the
night
but
we
reached
the
opposite
bank
without
accident
we
had
still
another
river
the
guargante
to
pass
but
we
were
cheered
by
some
peasants
whom
we
met
with
the
news
that
the
had
resumed
operations
after
this
current
lay
behind
us
and
there
was
now
nothing
but
firm
land
all
the
way
to
gibraltar
josé
declared
with
much
earnestness
that
he
was
quite
as
glad
for
my
sake
as
if
somebody
had
given
him
a
million
of
dollars
our
horses
too
seemed
to
feel
that
something
had
been
achieved
and
showed
such
a
fresh
spirit
that
we
loosened
the
reins
and
let
them
gallop
to
their
hearts
content
over
the
green
meadows
the
mountains
were
now
behind
us
and
the
moorish
castle
of
gaucin
crested
a
peak
blue
with
the
distance
over
hills
covered
with
broom
and
heather
in
blossom
and
through
hollows
grown
with
oleander
arbutus
and
the
mastic
shrub
we
rode
to
the
forests
of
san
roque
the
of
gibraltar
officers
the
barking
of
dogs
the
cracking
of
whips
and
now
and
then
a
distant
halloo
announced
that
a
hunt
was
in
progress
and
soon
we
came
upon
a
company
of
thirty
or
forty
horsemen
in
caps
white
gloves
and
scattered
along
the
crest
of
a
hill
i
had
no
desire
to
stop
and
witness
the
sport
for
the
mediterranean
now
lay
before
me
and
the
huge
gray
mass
of
the
rock
loomed
in
the
distance
at
san
roque
which
occupies
the
summit
of
a
conical
hill
about
between
gibraltar
and
algeciras
the
landlord
left
us
and
immediately
started
on
his
return
having
now
exchanged
the
rugged
of
ronda
for
a
smooth
josé
and
i
dashed
on
at
full
gallop
to
the
end
of
our
journey
we
were
both
bespattered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
and
our
jackets
and
sombreros
had
lost
something
of
their
spruce
air
we
met
a
great
many
ruddy
englishmen
who
reined
up
on
one
side
to
let
us
pass
with
a
look
of
wonder
at
our
andalusian
impudence
nothing
diverted
josé
more
than
to
see
one
of
these
englishmen
rising
in
his
stirrups
as
he
went
by
on
a
trot
look
look
señor
he
exclaimed
did
you
ever
see
the
like
and
then
broke
into
a
fresh
explosion
of
laughter
passing
the
spanish
lines
which
stretch
across
the
neck
of
the
sandy
little
peninsula
connecting
gibraltar
with
the
main
land
we
rode
under
the
terrible
batteries
which
snarl
at
spain
from
this
side
of
the
rock
row
after
row
of
enormous
guns
bristle
the
walls
or
look
out
from
the
galleries
hewn
in
the
sides
of
inaccessible
cliffs
an
artificial
moat
is
cut
along
the
base
of
the
rock
and
a
simple
leads
into
the
fortress
and
town
after
giving
up
my
passport
i
was
allowed
to
enter
josé
having
already
obtained
a
permit
from
the
spanish
authorities
i
clattered
up
the
long
street
of
the
town
to
the
club
house
where
i
found
a
company
of
english
friends
in
the
evening
josé
made
his
appearance
to
settle
our
accounts
and
take
his
leave
of
me
while
scrambling
down
the
rocky
of
gaucin
josé
had
said
to
me
look
you
señor
i
am
very
fond
of
english
beer
and
if
i
get
you
to
gibraltar
to
day
you
must
give
me
a
glass
of
it
when
therefore
he
came
in
the
evening
his
eyes
sparkled
at
the
sight
of
a
bottle
of
alsop
ale
and
a
handful
of
good
gibraltar
cigars
ah
señor
said
he
after
our
books
were
squared
and
he
had
pocketed
his
i
am
sorry
we
are
going
to
part
for
we
are
good
friends
are
we
not
señor
yes
josé
said
i
if
i
ever
come
to
granada
again
i
shall
take
no
other
guide
than
josé
garcia
and
i
will
have
you
for
a
longer
journey
than
this
we
shall
go
over
all
spain
together
may
god
grant
it
responded
josé
crossing
himself
and
now
señor
i
must
go
i
shall
travel
back
to
granada
señor
the
faithful
fellows
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
as
he
lifted
my
hand
twice
to
his
lips
some
warm
drops
fell
upon
it
god
bless
his
honest
heart
wherever
he
goes
and
now
a
word
as
to
travelling
in
spain
which
is
not
attended
with
half
the
difficulties
and
annoyances
i
had
been
led
to
expect
my
experience
of
course
is
limited
to
the
provinces
of
andalusia
but
my
route
included
some
of
the
roughest
roads
and
most
dangerous
in
the
peninsula
the
people
with
whom
i
came
in
contact
were
invariably
friendly
and
obliging
and
i
was
dealt
with
much
more
honestly
than
i
should
have
been
in
italy
with
every
disposition
to
serve
you
there
is
nothing
like
servility
among
the
spaniards
the
native
dignity
which
characterizes
their
demeanor
prepossesses
me
very
strongly
in
their
favor
there
is
but
one
dialect
of
courtesy
and
the
muleteers
and
common
peasants
address
each
other
with
the
same
grave
respect
as
the
dons
and
grandees
my
friend
josé
was
a
model
of
i
had
little
trouble
either
with
or
my
passport
in
fact
was
never
once
demanded
although
i
took
the
precaution
to
have
it
visèd
in
all
the
large
cities
in
seville
and
malaga
it
was
signed
by
the
american
consuls
without
the
usual
fee
of
two
dollars
almost
the
only
instances
which
have
come
under
my
observation
the
regulations
of
the
american
consular
system
which
gives
the
consuls
no
salary
but
permits
them
instead
to
get
their
pay
out
of
travellers
is
a
disgrace
to
our
government
it
amounts
in
effect
to
direct
tax
on
and
falls
heavily
on
the
hundreds
of
young
men
of
limited
means
who
annually
visit
europe
for
the
purpose
of
completing
their
education
every
american
citizen
who
travels
in
italy
pays
a
passport
tax
of
ten
dollars
in
all
the
ports
of
the
mediterranean
there
is
an
american
who
does
not
even
get
the
postage
paid
on
his
dispatches
and
to
whom
the
advent
of
a
traveller
is
of
course
a
welcome
sight
misled
by
a
false
notion
of
economy
our
government
is
fast
becoming
proverbial
for
its
meanness
if
those
of
our
own
citizens
who
represent
us
abroad
only
worked
as
they
are
paid
and
if
the
foreigners
who
act
as
without
pay
did
not
derive
some
petty
trading
advantages
from
their
position
we
should
be
almost
without
protection
with
my
departure
from
spain
closes
the
record
of
my
journey
in
the
lands
of
the
saracen
for
although
i
afterwards
beheld
more
perfect
types
of
saracenic
art
on
the
banks
of
the
jumna
and
the
ganges
they
grew
up
under
the
great
empire
of
the
descendants
of
tamerlane
and
were
the
creations
of
artists
foreign
to
the
soil
it
would
no
doubt
be
interesting
to
contrast
the
remains
of
oriental
civilization
and
refinement
as
they
still
exist
at
the
extreme
eastern
and
western
limits
of
the
moslem
sway
and
to
show
how
that
art
which
had
its
birth
in
the
capitals
of
the
caliphs
damascus
and
baghdad
attained
its
most
perfect
development
in
spain
and
india
but
my
visit
to
the
latter
country
connects
itself
naturally
with
my
voyage
to
china
and
japan
forming
a
separate
and
distinct
field
of
travel
on
the
of
november
the
overland
mail
steamer
arrived
at
gibraltar
and
i
embarked
in
her
for
alexandria
entering
upon
another
year
of
even
more
varied
strange
and
adventurous
experiences
than
that
which
had
closed
i
am
almost
afraid
to
ask
those
patient
readers
who
have
accompanied
me
thus
far
to
travel
with
me
through
another
volume
but
next
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
world
comes
the
pleasure
of
telling
of
it
and
i
must
needs
finish
my
story
