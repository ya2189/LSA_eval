originally
published
in

to
which
is
prefixed
an
account
of
the
early
roads
and
modes
of
travelling
in
britain
from
this
volume
read
in
connection
with
the
lives
of
george
and
robert
stephenson
in
which
the
origin
and
extension
of
railways
is
described
an
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
extraordinary
progress
which
has
been
made
in
opening
up
the
internal
communications
of
this
country
during
the
last
century
among
the
principal
works
executed
by
telford
in
the
course
of
his
life
were
the
great
highways
constructed
by
him
in
north
wales
and
the
scotch
highlands
through
districts
formerly
almost
inaccessible
but
which
are
now
as
easily
traversed
as
any
english
county
by
means
of
these
roads
and
the
facilities
afforded
by
railways
the
many
are
now
enabled
to
visit
with
ease
and
comfort
magnificent
mountain
scenery
which
before
was
only
the
costly
privilege
of
the
few
at
the
same
time
that
their
construction
has
exercised
a
most
beneficial
influence
on
the
population
of
the
districts
themselves
the
highland
roads
which
were
constructed
with
the
active
assistance
of
the
government
and
were
maintained
partly
at
the
public
expense
until
within
the
last
few
years
had
the
effect
of
stimulating
industry
improving
agriculture
and
converting
a
turbulent
because
unemployed
population
into
one
of
the
most
loyal
and
in
the
empire
the
policy
thus
adopted
with
reference
to
the
highlands
and
the
beneficial
results
which
have
flowed
from
it
affording
the
strongest
encouragement
to
government
in
dealing
in
like
manner
with
the
internal
communications
of
ireland
while
the
construction
of
the
highland
roads
was
in
progress
the
late
robert
southey
poet
laureate
visited
the
highlands
in
company
with
his
friend
the
engineer
and
left
on
record
an
interesting
account
of
his
visit
in
a
manuscript
now
in
the
possession
of
robert
rawlinson
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
the
extracts
which
are
made

old

roads
have
in
all
times
been
among
the
most
influential
agencies
of
society
and
the
makers
of
them
by
enabling
men
readily
to
communicate
with
each
other
have
properly
been
regarded
as
among
the
most
effective
pioneers
of
civilization
roads
are
literally
the
pathways
not
only
of
industry
but
of
social
and
national
intercourse
wherever
a
line
of
communication
between
men
is
formed
it
renders
commerce
practicable
and
wherever
commerce
penetrates
it
creates
a
civilization
and
leaves
a
history
roads
place

city
and
the
town
in
connection
with
the
village
and
the
farm
open
up
markets
for
field
produce
and
provide
outlets
for
manufactures
they
enable
the
natural
resources
of
a
country
to
be
developed
facilitate
travelling
and
intercourse
break
down
local
jealousies
and
in
all
ways
tend
to
bind
together
society
and
bring
out
fully
that
healthy
spirit
of
industry
which
is
the
life
and
soul
of
every
nation
the
road
is
so
necessary
an
instrument
of
social
wellbeing
that
in
every
new
colony
it
is
one
of
the
first
things
thought
of
first
roads
then
commerce
institutions
schools
churches
and
newspapers
the
new
country
as
well
as
the
old
can
only
be
effectually
opened
up
as
the
common
phrase
is
by
roads
and
until
these
are
made
it
is
virtually
closed
freedom
itself
can
not
exist
without
free
communication
every
limitation
of
movement
on
the
part
of
the
members
of
society
amounting
to
a
positive
abridgment
of
their
personal
liberty
hence
roads
canals
and
railways
by
providing
the
greatest
possible
facilities
for
locomotion
and
information
are
essential
for
the
freedom
of
all
classes
of
the
poorest
as
well
as
the
richest
by
bringing
the
ends
of
a
kingdom
together
they
reduce
the
inequalities
of
fortune
and
station
and
by
equalizing
the
price
of
commodities
to
that
extent
they
render
them
accessible
to
all
without
their
assistance
the
concentrated
populations
of
our
large
towns
could
neither
be
clothed
nor
fed
but
by
their
instrumentality
an
immense
range
of
country
is
brought
as
it
were
to
their
very
doors
and
the
sustenance
and
employment
of
large
masses
of
people
become
comparatively
easy
in
the
raw
materials
required
for
food
for
manufactures
and
for
domestic
purposes
the
cost
of
transport
necessarily
forms
a
considerable
item
and
it
is
clear
that
the
more
this
cost
can
be
reduced
by
facilities
of
communication
the
cheaper
these
articles
become
and
the
more
they
are
multiplied
and
enter
into
the
consumption
of
the
community
at
large
let
any
one
imagine
what
would
be
the
effect
of
closing
the
roads
railways
and
canals
of
england
the
country
would
be
brought
to
a
dead
lock
employment
would
be
restricted
in
all
directions
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
inhabitants
concentrated
in
the
large
towns
must
at
certain
seasons
inevitably
perish
of
cold
and
hunger
in
the
earlier
periods
of
english
history
roads
were
of
comparatively
less
consequence
while
the
population
was
thin
and
scattered
and
men
lived
by
hunting
and
pastoral
pursuits
the
track
across
the
down
the
heath
and
the
moor
sufficiently
answered
their
purpose
yet
even
in
those
districts
unencumbered
with
wood
where
the
first
settlements
were
made
as
on
the
downs
of
wiltshire
the
moors
of
devonshire
and
the
wolds
of
yorkshire
stone
tracks
were
laid
down
by
the
tribes
between
one
village
and
another
we
have
given
here
a
representation
of
one
of
those
ancient
trackways
still
existing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
whitby
in
yorkshire
image
ancient
causeway
near
whitby
and
there
are
many
of
the
same
description
to
be
met
with
in
other
parts
of
england
in
some
districts
they
are
called
trackways
or
ridgeways
being
narrow
causeways
usually
following
the
natural
ridge
of
the
country
and
probably
serving
in
early
times
as
local
boundaries
on
dartmoor
they
are
constructed
of
stone
blocks
irregularly
laid
down
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
forming
a
rude
causeway
of
about
five
or
six
feet
wide
the
romans
with
many
other
arts
first
brought
into
england
the
art
of
they
thoroughly
understood
the
value
of
good
roads
regarding
them
as
the
essential
means
for
the
maintenance
of
their
empire
in
the
first
instance
and
of
social
prosperity
in
the
next
it
was
their
roads
as
well
as
their
legions
that
made
them
masters
of
the
world
and
the
pickaxe
not
less
than
the
sword
was
the
ensign
of
their
dominion
wherever
they
went
they
opened
up
the
communications
of
the
countries
they
subdued
and
the
roads
which
they
made
were
among
the
best
of
their
kind
they
were
skilfully
laid
out
and
solidly
constructed
for
centuries
after
the
romans
left
england
their
roads
continued
to
be
the
main
highways
of
internal
communication
and
their
remains
are
to
this
day
to
be
traced
in
many
parts
of
the
country
settlements
were
made
and
towns
sprang
up
along
the
old
streets
and
the
numerous
stretfords
stratfords
and
towns
ending
in
as
in
yorkshire
and
in
durham
mostly
mark
the
direction
of
these
ancient
lines
of
road
there
are
also
numerous
stanfords
which
were
so
called
because
they
bordered
the
raised
military
roadways
of
the
romans
which
ran
direct
between
their
stations
the
peculiarity
of
the
roads
constructed
by
the
romans
must
have
struck
many
observers
level
does
not
seem
to
have
been
of
consequence
compared
with
directness
this
peculiarity
is
supposed
to
have
originated
in
an
imperfect
knowledge
of
mechanics
for
the
romans
do
not
appear
to
have
been
acquainted
with
the
moveable
joint
in
wheeled
carriages
the
rested
solid
upon
the
axles
which
in
vehicles
were
rigidly
parallel
with
each
other
being
unable
readily
to
turn
a
bend
in
the
road
it
has
been
concluded
that
for
this
reason
all
the
great
roman
highways
were
constructed
in
as
straight
lines
as
possible
on
the
departure
of
the
romans
from
britain
most
of
the
roads
constructed
by
them
were
allowed
to
fall
into
decay
on
which
the
forest
and
the
waste
gradually
resumed
their
dominion
over
them
and
the
highways
of
england
became
about
the
worst
in
europe
we
find
however
that
numerous
attempts
were
made
in
early
times
to
preserve
the
ancient
ways
and
enable
a
communication
to
be
maintained
between
the
metropolis
and
the
rest
of
the
country
as
well
as
between
one
market
town
and
another
the
state
of
the
highways
may
be
inferred
from
the
character
of
the
legislation
applying
to
them
one
of
the
first
laws
on
the
subject
was
passed
in
directing
that
all
bushes
and
trees
along
the
roads
leading
from
one
market
to
another
should
be
cut
down
for
two
hundred
feet
on
either
side
to
prevent
robbers
lurking
therein
but
nothing
was
proposed
for
amending
the
condition
of
the
ways
themselves
in
edward
iii
authorised
the
first
toll
to
be
levied
for
the
repair
of
the
roads
leading
from
to
the
village
of
charing
now
charing
cross
and
from
the
same
quarter
to
near
temple
bar
down
drury
lane
as
well
as
the
highway
then
called
perpoole
now
gray
inn
lane
the
footway
at
the
entrance
of
temple
bar
was
interrupted
by
thickets
and
bushes
and
in
wet
weather
was
almost
impassable
the
roads
further
west
were
so
bad
that
when
the
sovereign
went
to
parliament
faggots
were
thrown
into
the
ruts
in
westminster
to
enable
the
royal
cavalcade
to
pass
along
in
henry
viii
reign
several
remarkable
statutes
were
passed
relating
to
certain
and
impracticable
roads
in
sussex
and
the
weald
of
kent
from
the
earliest
of
these
it
would
appear
that
when
the
old
roads
were
found
too
deep
and
miry
to
be
passed
they
were
merely
abandoned
and
new
tracks
struck
out
after
describing
many
of
the
wayes
in
the
wealds
as
so
depe
and
noyous
by
wearyng
and
course
of
water
and
other
occasions
that
people
can
not
have
their
carriages
or
passages
by
horses
uppon
or
by
the
same
but
to
their
great
paynes
perill
and
jeopardie
the
act
provided
that
owners
of
land
might
with
the
consent
of
two
justices
and
twelve
discreet
men
of
the
hundred
lay
out
new
roads
and
close
up
the
old
ones
another
act
passed
in
the
same
reign
related
to
the
repairs
of
bridges
and
of
the
highways
at
the
ends
of
bridges
but
as
these
measures
were
for
the
most
part
merely
permissive
they
could
have
had
but
little
practical
effect
in
improving
the
communications
of
the
kingdom
in
the
reign
of
philip
and
mary
in
an
act
was
passed
providing
that
each
parish
should
elect
two
surveyors
of
highways
to
see
to
the
maintenance
of
their
repairs
by
compulsory
labour
the
preamble
reciting
that
highwaies
are
now
both
verie
noisome
and
tedious
to
travell
in
and
dangerous
to
all
passengers
and
cariages
and
to
this
day
parish
and
cross
roads
are
maintained
on
the
principle
of
act
though
the
compulsory
labour
has
since
been
commuted
into
a
compulsory
tax
in
the
reigns
of
elizabeth
and
james
other
road
acts
were
passed
but
from
the
statements
of
contemporary
writers
it
would
appear
that
they
were
followed
by
very
little
substantial
progress
and
travelling
continued
to
be
attended
with
many
difficulties
even
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
the
highways
were
in
certain
seasons
scarcely
passable
the
great
western
road
into
london
was
especially
bad
and
about
knightsbridge
in
winter
the
traveller
had
to
wade
through
deep
mud
wyatt
men
entered
the
city
by
this
approach
in
the
rebellion
of
and
were
called
the
because
of
their
wretched
plight
the
ways
were
equally
bad
as
far
as
windsor
which
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
is
described
by
pote
in
his
history
of
that
town
as
being
not
much
past
half
a
journeye
removed
from
the
flourishing
citie
of
london
at
a
greater
distance
from
the
metropolis
the
roads
were
still
worse
they
were
in
many
cases
but
rude
tracks
across
heaths
and
commons
as
furrowed
with
deep
ruts
as
ploughed
fields
and
in
winter
to
pass
along
one
of
them
was
like
travelling
in
a
ditch
the
attempts
made
by
the
adjoining
occupiers
to
mend
them
were
for
the
most
part
confined
to
throwing
large
stones
into
the
bigger
holes
to
fill
them
up
it
was
easier
to
allow
new
tracks
to
be
made
than
to
mend
the
old
ones
the
land
of
the
country
was
still
mostly
unenclosed
and
it
was
possible
in
fine
weather
to
get
from
place
to
place
in
one
way
or
another
with
the
help
of
a
guide
in
the
absence
of
bridges
guides
were
necessary
to
point
out
the
safest
fords
as
well
as
to
pick
out
the
least
miry
tracks
the
most
frequented
lines
of
road
were
struck
out
from
time
to
time
by
the
drivers
of
who
to
avoid
the
bogs
and
sloughs
were
usually
careful
to
keep
along
the
higher
grounds
but
to
prevent
those
horsemen
who
departed
from
the
beaten
track
being
swallowed
up
in
quagmires
beacons
were
erected
to
warn
them
against
the
more
dangerous
places
in
some
of
the
districts
of
england
the
old
roads
are
still
to
be
traced
in
the
hollow
ways
or
lanes
which
are
to
be
met
with
in
some
places
eight
and
ten
feet
deep
they
were
in
summer
and
rivulets
in
winter
by
dint
of
weather
and
travel
the
earth
was
gradually
worn
into
these
deep
furrows
many
of
which
in
wilts
somerset
and
devon
represent
the
tracks
of
roads
as
old
as
if
not
older
than
the
conquest
when
the
ridgeways
of
the
earliest
settlers
on
dartmoor
above
alluded
to
were
abandoned
the
tracks
were
formed
through
the
valleys
but
the
new
roads
were
no
better
than
the
old
ones
they
were
narrow
and
deep
fitted
only
for
a
horse
passing
along
laden
with
its
crooks
as
so
graphically
described
in
the
ballad
of
the
devonshire
lane
similar
roads
existed
until
recently
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
birmingham
now
the
centre
of
an
immense
traffic
the
sandy
soil
was
sawn
through
as
it
were
by
generation
after
generation
of
human
feet
and
by
packhorses
helped
by
the
rains
until
in
some
places
the
tracks
were
as
much
as
from
twelve
to
fourteen
yards
deep
one
of
these
partly
filled
up
retaining
to
this
day
the
name
of
holloway
head
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
there
was
also
a
hollow
way
which
now
gives
its
name
to
a
populous
metropolitan
parish
hagbush
lane
was
another
of
such
roads
before
the
formation
of
the
great
north
road
it
was
one
of
the
principal
leading
from
london
to
the
northern
parts
of
england
but
it
was
so
narrow
as
barely
to
afford
passage
for
more
than
a
single
horseman
and
so
deep
that
the
rider
head
was
beneath
the
level
of
the
ground
on
either
side
the
roads
of
sussex
long
preserved
an
infamous
notoriety
chancellor
cowper
when
a
barrister
on
circuit
wrote
to
his
wife
in
that
the
sussex
ways
are
bad
and
ruinous
beyond
imagination
i
vow
is
melancholy
consideration
that
mankind
will
in
habit
such
a
heap
of
dirt
for
a
poor
livelihood
the
country
is
a
sink
of
about
fourteen
miles
broad
which
receives
all
the
water
that
falls
from
two
long
ranges
of
hills
on
both
sides
of
it
and
not
being
furnished
with
convenient
draining
is
kept
moist
and
soft
by
the
water
till
the
middle
of
a
dry
summer
which
is
only
able
to
make
it
tolerable
to
ride
for
a
short
time
it
was
almost
as
difficult
for
old
persons
to
get
to
church
in
sussex
during
winter
as
it
was
in
the
lincoln
fens
where
they
were
rowed
thither
in
boats
fuller
saw
an
old
lady
being
drawn
to
church
in
her
own
coach
by
the
aid
of
six
oxen
the
sussex
roads
were
indeed
so
bad
as
to
pass
into
a
a
contemporary
writer
says
that
in
travelling
a
slough
of
extraordinary
miryness
it
used
to
be
called
the
sussex
bit
of
the
road
and
he
satirically
alleged
that
the
reason
why
the
sussex
girls
were
so
was
because
of
the
tenacity
of
the
mud
in
that
county
the
practice
of
pulling
the
foot
out
of
it
by
the
strength
of
the
ancle
tending
to
stretch
the
muscle
and
lengthen
the
bone
but
the
roads
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
london
long
continued
almost
as
bad
as
those
in
sussex
thus
when
the
poet
cowley
retired
to
chertsey
in
he
wrote
to
his
friend
sprat
to
visit
him
and
by
way
of
encouragement
told
him
that
he
might
sleep
the
first
night
at
hampton
town
thus
occupying
two
days
in
the
performance
of
a
journey
of
miles
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
as
late
as
we
find
lord
hervey
writing
from
kensington
complaining
that
the
road
between
this
place
and
london
is
grown
so
infamously
bad
that
we
live
here
in
the
same
solitude
as
we
would
do
if
cast
on
a
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
and
all
the
londoners
tell
us
that
there
is
between
them
and
us
an
impassable
gulf
of
mud
nor
was
the
mud
any
respecter
of
persons
for
we
are
informed
that
the
carriage
of
queen
caroline
could
not
in
bad
weather
be
dragged
from
james
palace
to
kensington
in
less
than
two
hours
and
occasionally
the
royal
coach
stuck
fast
in
a
rut
or
was
even
capsized
in
the
mud
about
the
same
time
the
streets
of
london
themselves
were
little
better
the
kennel
being
still
permitted
to
flow
in
the
middle
of
the
road
which
was
paved
with
round
stones
for
the
convenience
of
pedestrians
being
as
yet
unknown
in
short
the
streets
in
the
towns
and
the
roads
in
the
country
were
alike
rude
and
wretched
indicating
a
degree
of
social
stagnation
and
discomfort
which
it
is
now
difficult
to
estimate
and
almost
impossible
to
describe

him
from
london
to
oxford
about
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
resting
by
the
way
at
shirburn
castle
he
says
our
journey
from
london
to
oxford
was
with
some
difficulty
and
danger
made
in
two
days
for
the
roads
are
bad
and
we
had
to
climb
hills
of
hazardous
ascent
and
which
to
descend
are
equally
perilous
we
passed
through
many
woods
considered
here
as
dangerous
places
as
they
are
infested
with
robbers
which
indeed
is
the
case
with
most
of
the
roads
in
england
this
is
a
circumstance
connived
at
by
the
neighbouring
barons
on
consideration
of
sharing
in
the
booty
and
of
these
robbers
serving
as
their
protectors
on
all
occasions
personally
and
with
the
whole
strength
of
their
band
however
as
our
company
was
numerous
we
had
less
to
fear
accordingly
we
arrived
the
first
night
at
shirburn
castle
in
the
neighbourhood
of

under
the
chain
of

this

so
descriptive

it

john

sometime
vicar
of

devon
and

vicar

says
in

of

can
readily
imagine
the
identical

might
have

sure
marriage

a

in
the

long
and
when
once
you
are
in

it

you

you
must
there

is
so
long
it
is

the
most
that
together

then
is

they

shakespeare
is
but
a
picture
by
no
means
exaggerated
of
the
adventures
and
dangers
of
the
road
at
the
time
of
which
he
wrote
distinguished
personages
sometimes
rode
in
but
riding
on
horseback
was
generally
preferred
queen
elizabeth
made
most
of
her
journeys
in
this
way
and
when
she
went
into
the
city
she
rode
on
a
pillion
behind
her
lord
chancellor
the
queen
however
was
at
length
provided
with
a
coach
which
must
have
been
a
very
remarkable
machine
this
royal
vehicle
is
said
to
have
been
one
of
the
first
coaches
used
in
england
and
it
was
introduced
by
the
queen
own
coachman
one
boomen
a
dutchman
it
was
little
better
than
a
cart
without
springs
the
body
resting
solid
upon
the
axles
taking
the
bad
roads
and
streets
into
account
it
must
have
been
an
excessively
painful
means
of
conveyance
at
one
of
the
first
audiences
which
the
queen
gave
to
the
french
ambassador
in
she
feelingly
described
to
him
the
aching
pains
she
was
suffering
in
consequence
of
having
been
knocked
about
in
a
coach
which
had
been
driven
a
little
too
fast
only
a
few
days
before
such
coaches
were
at
first
only
used
on
state
occasions
the
roads
even
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
london
were
so
bad
and
so
narrow
that
the
vehicles
could
not
be
taken
into
the
country
but
as
the
roads
became
improved
the
fashion
of
using
them
spread
when
the
aristocracy
removed
from
the
city
to
the
western
parts
of
the
metropolis
they
could
be
better
accommodated
and
in
course
of
time
they
became
gradually
adopted
they
were
still
however
neither
more
nor
less
than
waggons
and
indeed
were
called
by
that
name
but
wherever
they
went
they
excited
great
wonder
it
is
related
of
that
valyant
knyght
sir
harry
sidney
that
on
a
certain
day
in
the
year
he
entered
shrewsbury
in
his
waggon
with
his
trompeter
blowynge
verey
joyfull
to
behold
and
see
from
this
time
the
use
of
coaches
gradually
spread
more
particularly
amongst
the
nobility
superseding
the
which
had
till
then
been
used
for
the
conveyance
of
ladies
and
others
unable
to
bear
the
fatigue
of
riding
on
horseback
the
first
carriages
were
heavy
and
lumbering
and
upon
the
execrable
roads
of
the
time
they
went
pitching
over
the
stones
and
into
the
ruts
with
the
pole
dipping
and
rising
like
a
ship
in
a
rolling
sea
that
they
had
no
springs
is
clear
enough
from
the
statement
of
taylor
the
who
deplored
the
introduction
of
carriages
as
a
national
calamity
that
in
the
paved
streets
of
london
men
and
women
were
tossed
tumbled
rumbled
and
jumbled
about
in
them
although
the
road
from
london
to
dover
along
the
old
roman
was
then
one
of
the
best
in
england
the
french
household
of
queen
henrietta
when
they
were
sent
forth
from
the
palace
of
charles
occupied
four
tedious
days
before
they
reached
dover
but
it
was
only
a
few
of
the
main
roads
leading
from
the
metropolis
that
were
practicable
for
coaches
and
on
the
occasion
of
a
royal
progress
or
the
visit
of
a
there
was
a
general
turn
out
of
labourers
and
masons
to
mend
the
ways
and
render
the
bridges
at
least
temporarily
secure
of
one
of
queen
journeys
it
is
said
it
was
marvellous
for
ease
and
expedition
for
such
is
the
perfect
evenness
of
the
new
highway
that
her
majesty
left
the
coach
only
once
while
the
hinds
and
the
folk
of
a
base
sort
lifted
it
on
with
their
poles
sussex
long
continued
impracticable
for
coach
travelling
at
certain
seasons
as
late
as
prince
george
of
denmark
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
making
his
way
to
petworth
to
meet
charles
vi
of
spain
the
last
nine
miles
of
the
way
says
the
reporter
cost
us
six
hours
to
conquer
them
one
of
the
couriers
in
attendance
complained
that
during
fourteen
hours
he
never
once
alighted
except
when
the
coach
overturned
or
stuck
in
the
mud
when
the
judges
usually
old
men
and
bad
riders
took
to
going
the
circuit
in
their
coaches
juries
were
often
kept
waiting
until
their
lordships
could
be
dug
out
of
a
bog
or
hauled
out
of
a
slough
by
the
aid
of
in
the
seventeenth
century
scarcely
a
quarter
session
passed
without
presentments
from
the
grand
jury
against
certain
districts
on
account
of
the
bad
state
of
the
roads
and
many
were
the
fines
which
the
judges
imposed
upon
them
as
a
against
their
bruises
and
other
damages
while
on
circuit
for
a
long
time
the
roads
continued
barely
practicable
for
wheeled
vehicles
of
the
rudest
sort
though
fynes
morison
writing
in
the
time
of
james
i
gives
an
account
of
carryers
who
have
long
covered
waggons
in
which
they
carry
passengers
from
place
to
place
but
this
kind
of
journeying
he
says
is
so
tedious
by
reason
they
must
take
waggon
very
early
and
come
very
late
to
their
innes
that
none
but
women
and
people
of
inferior
condition
travel
in
this
sort
image
the
old
stage
waggon
the
waggons
of
which
morison
wrote
made
only
from
ten
to
fifteen
miles
in
a
long
summer
day
that
is
supposing
them
not
to
have
broken
down
by
pitching
over
the
boulders
laid
along
the
road
or
stuck
fast
in
a
quagmire
when
they
had
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
the
next
team
of
horses
to
help
to
drag
them
out
the
waggon
however
continued
to
be
adopted
as
a
popular
mode
of
travelling
until
late
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
hogarth
picture
illustrating
the
practice
will
be
remembered
of
the
cassocked
parson
on
his
lean
horse
attending
his
daughter
newly
alighted
from
the
york
waggon
a
curious
description
of
the
state
of
the
great
north
road
in
the
time
of
charles
is
to
be
found
in
a
tract
published
in
by
thomas
mace
one
of
the
clerks
of
trinity
college
cambridge
the
writer
there
addressed
himself
to
the
king
partly
in
prose
and
partly
in
verse
complaining
greatly
of
the
wayes
which
are
so
grossly
foul
and
bad
and
suggesting
various
remedies
he
pointed
out
that
much
ground
is
now
spoiled
and
trampled
down
in
all
wide
roads
where
coaches
and
carts
take
liberty
to
pick
and
chuse
for
their
best
advantages
besides
such
sprawling
and
straggling
of
coaches
and
carts
utterly
confound
the
road
in
all
wide
places
so
that
it
is
not
only
unpleasurable
but
extreme
perplexin
and
cumbersome
both
to
themselves
and
all
horse
travellers
it
would
thus
appear
that
the
country
on
either
side
of
the
road
was
as
yet
entirely
unenclosed
but
mace
principal
complaint
was
of
the
innumerable
controversies
quarrellings
and
disturbances
caused
by
the
in
their
struggles
as
to
which
convoy
should
pass
along
the
cleaner
parts
of
the
road
from
what
he
states
it
would
seem
that
these
disturbances
daily
committed
by
uncivil
refractory
and
rude
in
contesting
for
the
way
too
often
proved
mortal
and
certainly
were
of
very
bad
consequences
to
many
he
recommended
a
quick
and
prompt
punishment
in
all
such
cases
no
man
said
he
should
be
pestered
by
giving
the
way
sometimes
to
hundreds
of
panniers
whifflers
paltry
fellows
coaches
waggons
wains
carts
or
whatsoever
others
which
continually
are
very
grievous
to
weary
and
loaden
travellers
but
more
especially
near
the
city
and
upon
a
market
day
when
a
man
having
travelled
a
long
and
tedious
journey
his
horse
well
nigh
spent
shall
sometimes
be
compelled
to
cross
out
of
his
way
twenty
times
in
one
mile
riding
by
the
irregularity
and
peevish
crossness
of
whifflers
and
market
women
yea
although
their
panniers
be
clearly
empty
they
will
stoutly
contend
for
the
way
with
weary
travellers
be
they
never
so
many
or
almost
of
what
quality
soever
nay
said
he
further
i
have
often
known
many
travellers
and
myself
very
often
to
have
been
necessitated
to
stand
stock
still
behind
a
standing
cart
or
waggon
on
most
beastly
and
unsufferable
deep
wet
wayes
to
the
great
endangering
of
our
horses
and
neglect
of
important
business
nor
durst
we
adventure
to
stirr
for
most
imminent
danger
of
those
deep
rutts
and
unreasonable
ridges
till
it
has
pleased
mister
garter
to
jog
on
which
we
have
taken
very
kindly
mace
plan
of
road
reform
was
not
extravagant
he
mainly
urged
that
only
two
good
tracks
should
be
maintained
and
the
road
be
not
allowed
to
spread
out
into
as
many
as
very
bad
ones
presenting
high
ridges
and
deep
ruts
full
of
big
stones
and
many
quagmires
breaking
out
into
verse
he
said
first
let
the
wayes
be
regularly
brought
to
artificial
form
and
truly
wrought
so
that
we
can
suppose
them
firmly
mended
and
in
all
parts
the
work
well
ended
that
not
a
stone
amiss
but
all
compleat
all
lying
smooth
round
firm
and
wondrous
neat
after
a
good
deal
more
in
the
same
strain
he
concluded
there
only
one
thing
yet
worth
thinking
on
which
is
to
put
this
work
in
execution
but
we
shall
find
that
more
than
a
hundred
years
passed
before
the
roads
throughout
england
were
placed
in
a
more
satisfactory
state
than
they
were
in
the
time
of
mace
the
introduction
of
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
formed
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
travelling
by
road
at
first
they
were
only
a
better
sort
of
waggon
and
confined
to
the
more
practicable
highways
near
london
their
pace
did
not
exceed
four
miles
an
hour
and
the
jolting
of
the
unfortunate
passengers
conveyed
in
them
must
have
been
very
hard
to
bear
it
used
to
be
said
of
their
drivers
that
they
were
seldom
sober
never
civil
and
always
late
the
first
mention
of
coaches
for
public
accommodation
is
made
by
sir
william
dugdale
in
his
diary
from
which
it
appears
that
a
coventry
coach
was
on
the
road
in
but
probably
the
first
coaches
or
rather
waggons
were
run
between
london
and
dover
as
one
of
the
most
practicable
routes
for
the
purpose
sobriere
a
french
man
of
letters
who
landed
at
dover
on
his
way
to
london
in
the
time
of
charles
alludes
to
the
existence
of
a
stagecoach
but
it
seems
to
have
had
no
charms
for
him
as
the
following
passage
will
show
that
i
might
not
he
says
take
post
or
be
obliged
to
use
the
i
went
from
dover
to
london
in
a
waggon
i
was
drawn
by
six
horses
one
before
another
and
driven
by
a
waggoner
who
walked
by
the
side
of
it
he
was
clothed
in
black
and
appointed
in
all
things
like
another
george
he
had
a
brave
montrero
on
his
head
and
was
a
merry
fellow
fancied
he
made
a
figure
and
seemed
mightily
pleased
with
himself
shortly
after
coaches
seem
to
have
been
running
as
far
north
as
preston
in
lancashire
as
appears
by
a
letter
from
one
edward
parker
to
his
father
dated
november
in
which
he
says
i
got
to
london
on
saturday
last
but
my
journey
was
noe
ways
pleasant
being
forced
to
ride
in
the
boote
all
the
waye
ye
company
yt
came
up
with
mee
were
persons
of
greate
quality
as
knights
and
ladyes
my
journey
expense
was
this
traval
hath
soe
indisposed
mee
yt
i
am
resolved
never
to
ride
up
againe
in
ye
coatch
these
vehicles
must
however
have
considerably
increased
as
we
find
a
popular
agitation
was
got
up
against
them
the
londoners
nicknamed
them
pamphlets
were
written
recommending
their
abolition
and
attempts
were
even
made
to
have
them
suppressed
by
act
of
parliament
thoresby
occasionally
alludes
to
in
his
diary
speaking
of
one
that
ran
between
hull
and
york
in
from
which
latter
place
he
had
to
proceed
by
leeds
in
the
usual
way
on
horseback
this
hull
vehicle
did
not
run
in
winter
because
of
the
state
of
the
roads
stagecoaches
being
usually
laid
up
in
that
season
like
ships
during
arctic
frosts
afterwards
when
a
coach
was
put
on
between
york
and
leeds
it
performed
the
journey
of
miles
in
eight
hours
but
the
road
was
so
bad
and
dangerous
that
the
travellers
were
accustomed
to
get
out
and
walk
the
greater
part
of
the
way
thoresby
often
waxes
eloquent
upon
the
subject
of
his
manifold
deliverances
from
the
dangers
of
travelling
by
coach
he
was
especially
thankful
when
he
had
passed
the
ferry
over
the
trent
in
journeying
between
leeds
and
london
having
on
several
occasions
narrowly
escaped
drowning
there
once
on
his
journey
to
london
some
showers
fell
which
raised
the
washes
upon
the
road
near
ware
to
that
height
that
passengers
from
london
that
were
upon
that
road
swam
and
a
poor
higgler
was
drowned
which
prevented
me
travelling
for
many
hours
yet
towards
evening
we
adventured
with
some
country
people
who
conducted
us
over
the
meadows
whereby
we
missed
the
deepest
of
the
wash
at
cheshunt
though
we
rode
to
the
for
a
considerable
way
but
got
safe
to
waltham
cross
where
we
lodged
on
another
occasion
thoresby
was
detained
four
days
at
stamford
by
the
state
of
the
roads
and
was
only
extricated
from
his
position
by
a
company
of
fourteen
members
of
the
house
of
commons
travelling
towards
london
who
took
him
into
their
convoy
and
set
out
on
their
way
southward
attended
by
competent
guides
when
the
waters
were
out
as
the
saying
went
the
country
became
closed
the
roads
being
simply
impassable
during
the
civil
wars
eight
hundred
horse
were
taken
prisoners
while
sticking
in
the
mud
when
rain
fell
pedestrians
horsemen
and
coaches
alike
came
to
a
standstill
until
the
roads
dried
again
and
enabled
the
wayfarers
to
proceed
thus
we
read
of
two
travellers
stopped
by
the
rains
within
a
few
miles
of
oxford
who
found
it
impossible
to
accomplish
their
journey
in
consequence
of
the
waters
that
covered
the
country
thereabout
a
curious
account
has
been
preserved
of
the
journey
of
an
irish
viceroy
across
north
wales
towards
dublin
in
the
roads
were
so
horrible
that
instead
of
the
viceroy
being
borne
along
in
his
coach
the
coach
itself
had
to
be
borne
after
him
the
greater
part
of
the
way
he
was
five
hours
in
travelling
between
asaph
and
conway
a
distance
of
only
fourteen
miles
between
conway
and
beaumaris
he
was
forced
to
walk
while
his
wife
was
borne
along
in
a
litter
the
carriages
were
usually
taken
to
pieces
at
conway
and
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
stout
welsh
peasants
to
be
embarked
at
the
straits
of
menai
the
introduction
of
like
every
other
public
improvement
was
at
first
regarded
with
prejudice
and
had
considerable
obloquy
to
encounter
in
a
curious
book
published
in
entitled
grand
concern
of
england
explained
in
several
proposals
to
parliament
stagecoaches
and
caravans
were
denounced
as
among
the
greatest
evils
that
had
happened
to
the
kingdom
being
alike
mischievous
to
the
public
destructive
to
trade
and
prejudicial
to
the
landed
interest
it
was
alleged
that
travelling
by
coach
was
calculated
to
destroy
the
breed
of
horses
and
make
men
careless
of
good
horsemanship
that
it
hindered
the
training
of
watermen
and
seamen
and
interfered
with
the
public
resources
the
reasons
given
are
curious
it
was
said
that
those
who
were
accustomed
to
travel
in
coaches
became
weary
and
listless
when
they
rode
a
few
miles
and
were
unwilling
to
get
on
horseback
not
being
able
to
endure
frost
snow
or
rain
or
to
lodge
in
the
fields
that
to
save
their
clothes
and
keep
themselves
clean
and
dry
people
rode
in
coaches
and
thus
contracted
an
idle
habit
of
body
that
this
was
ruinous
to
trade
for
that
most
gentlemen
before
they
travelled
in
coaches
used
to
ride
with
swords
belts
pistols
holsters
portmanteaus
and
which
in
these
coaches
they
have
little
or
no
occasion
for
for
when
they
rode
on
horseback
they
rode
in
one
suit
and
carried
another
to
wear
when
they
camp
to
their
journey
end
or
lay
by
the
way
but
in
coaches
a
silk
suit
and
an
indian
gown
with
a
sash
silk
stockings
and
men
ride
in
and
carry
no
other
with
them
because
they
escape
the
wet
and
dirt
which
on
horseback
they
can
not
avoid
whereas
in
two
or
three
journeys
on
horseback
these
clothes
and
hats
were
wont
to
be
spoiled
which
done
they
were
forced
to
have
new
very
often
and
that
increased
the
consumption
of
the
manufactures
and
the
employment
of
the
manufacturers
which
travelling
in
coaches
doth
in
no
way
do
the
writer
of
the
same
protest
against
coaches
gives
some
idea
of
the
extent
of
travelling
by
them
in
those
days
for
to
show
the
gigantic
nature
of
the
evil
he
was
contending
against
he
averred
that
between
london
and
the
three
principal
towns
of
york
chester
and
exeter
not
fewer
than
eighteen
persons
making
the
journey
in
five
days
travelled
by
them
weekly
the
coaches
running
thrice
in
the
week
and
a
like
number
back
which
come
in
the
whole
to
eighteen
hundred
and
in
the
year
another
great
nuisance
the
writer
alleged
which
flowed
from
the
establishment
of
the
was
that
not
only
did
the
gentlemen
from
the
country
come
to
london
in
them
oftener
than
they
need
but
their
ladies
either
came
with
them
or
quickly
followed
them
and
when
they
are
there
they
must
be
in
the
mode
have
all
the
new
fashions
buy
all
their
clothes
there
and
go
to
plays
balls
and
treats
where
they
get
such
a
habit
of
jollity
and
a
love
to
gaiety
and
pleasure
that
nothing
afterwards
in
the
country
will
serve
them
if
ever
they
should
fix
their
minds
to
live
there
again
but
they
must
have
all
from
london
whatever
it
costs
then
there
were
the
grievous
discomforts
of
travelling
to
be
set
against
the
more
noble
method
of
travelling
by
horseback
as
of
yore
what
advantage
is
it
to
men
health
says
the
writer
waxing
wroth
to
be
called
out
of
their
beds
into
these
coaches
an
hour
before
day
in
the
morning
to
be
hurried
in
them
from
place
to
place
till
one
hour
two
or
three
within
night
insomuch
that
after
sitting
all
day
in
the
stifled
with
heat
and
choked
with
dust
or
in
the
starving
and
freezing
with
cold
or
choked
with
filthy
fogs
they
are
often
brought
into
their
inns
by
torchlight
when
it
is
too
late
to
sit
up
to
get
a
supper
and
next
morning
they
are
forced
into
the
coach
so
early
that
they
can
get
no
breakfast
what
addition
is
this
to
men
health
or
business
to
ride
all
day
with
strangers
oftentimes
sick
antient
diseased
persons
or
young
children
crying
to
whose
humours
they
are
obliged
to
be
subject
forced
to
bear
with
and
many
times
are
poisoned
with
their
nasty
scents
and
crippled
by
the
crowd
of
boxes
and
bundles
is
it
for
a
man
health
to
travel
with
tired
jades
to
be
laid
fast
in
the
foul
ways
and
forced
to
wade
up
to
the
knees
in
mire
afterwards
sit
in
the
cold
till
teams
of
horses
can
be
sent
to
pull
the
coach
out
is
it
for
their
health
to
travel
in
rotten
coaches
and
to
have
their
tackle
perch
or
broken
and
then
to
wait
three
or
four
hours
sometimes
half
a
day
to
have
them
mended
and
then
to
travel
all
night
to
make
good
their
stage
is
it
for
a
man
pleasure
or
advantageous
to
his
health
and
business
to
travel
with
a
mixed
company
that
he
knows
not
how
to
converse
with
to
be
affronted
by
the
rudeness
of
a
surly
dogged
cursing
coachman
necessitated
to
lodge
or
bait
at
the
worst
inn
on
the
road
where
there
is
no
accommodation
fit
for
gentlemen
and
this
merely
because
the
owners
of
the
inns
and
the
coachmen
are
agreed
together
to
cheat
the
guests
hence
the
writer
loudly
called
for
the
immediate
suppression
of
stagecoaches
as
a
great
nuisance
and
crying
evil
travelling
by
coach
was
in
early
times
a
very
deliberate
affair
time
was
of
less
consequence
than
safety
and
coaches
were
advertised
to
start
god
willing
and
about
such
and
such
an
hour
as
shall
seem
good
to
the
majority
of
the
passengers
the
difference
of
a
day
in
the
journey
from
london
to
york
was
a
small
matter
and
thoresby
was
even
accustomed
to
leave
the
coach
and
go
in
search
of
fossil
shells
in
the
fields
on
either
side
the
road
while
making
the
journey
between
the
two
places
the
long
coach
put
up
at
and
slept
on
the
road
whether
the
coach
was
to
proceed
or
to
stop
at
some
favourite
inn
was
determined
by
the
vote
of
the
passengers
who
usually
appointed
a
chairman
at
the
beginning
of
the
journey
in
york
was
a
week
distant
from
london
and
tunbridge
wells
now
reached
in
an
hour
was
two
days
salisbury
and
oxford
were
also
each
a
two
days
journey
dover
was
three
days
and
exeter
five
the
fly
coach
from
london
to
exeter
slept
at
the
latter
place
the
fifth
night
from
town
the
coach
proceeding
next
morning
to
axminster
where
it
breakfasted
and
there
a
woman
barber
shaved
the
coach
between
london
and
edinburgh
as
late
as
a
fortnight
was
consumed
the
coach
only
starting
once
a
month
the
risk
of
in
driving
over
the
execrable
roads
may
be
inferred
from
the
circumstance
that
every
coach
carried
with
it
a
box
of
carpenter
tools
and
the
hatchets
were
occasionally
used
in
lopping
off
the
branches
of
trees
overhanging
the
road
and
obstructing
the
travellers
progress
some
fastidious
persons
disliking
the
slow
travelling
as
well
as
the
promiscuous
company
which
they
ran
the
risk
of
encountering
in
the
stage
were
accustomed
to
advertise
for
partners
in
a
postchaise
to
share
the
charges
and
lessen
the
dangers
of
the
road
and
indeed
to
a
sensitive
person
anything
must
have
been
preferable
to
the
misery
of
travelling
by
the
canterbury
stage
as
thus
described
by
a
contemporary
writer
on
both
sides
squeez
how
highly
was
i
blest
between
two
plump
old
women
to
be
presst
a
fierce
a
nurse
a
child
that
cry
and
a
fat
landlord
filled
the
other
side
scarce
dawns
the
morning
ere
the
cumbrous
load
boils
roughly
rumbling
the
rugged
road
one
old
wife
coughs
and
wheezes
in
my
ears
loud
scolds
the
other
and
the
soldier
swears
sour
unconcocted
breath
escapes
host
the
child
returns
his
milk
and
toast
when
samuel
johnson
was
taken
by
his
mother
to
london
in
to
have
him
touched
by
queen
anne
for
the
evil
he
relates
we
went
in
the
and
returned
in
the
waggon
as
my
mother
said
because
my
cough
was
violent
but
the
hope
of
saving
a
few
shillings
was
no
slight
motive
she
sewed
two
guineas
in
her
petticoat
lest
she
should
be
robbed
we
were
troublesome
to
the
passengers
but
to
suffer
such
inconveniences
in
the
was
common
in
those
days
to
parsons
in
much
higher
rank
pennant
has
left
us
the
following
account
of
his
journey
in
the
chester
stage
to
london
in
the
first
day
says
he
with
much
labour
we
got
from
chester
to
whitchurch
twenty
miles
the
second
day
to
the
harp
the
third
to
coventry
the
fourth
to
northampton
the
fifth
to
dunstable
and
as
a
wondrous
effort
on
the
last
to
london
before
the
commencement
of
night
the
strain
and
labour
of
six
good
horses
sometimes
eight
drew
us
through
the
sloughs
of
mireden
and
many
other
places
we
were
constantly
out
two
hours
before
day
and
as
late
at
night
and
in
the
depth
of
winter
proportionally
later
the
single
gentlemen
then
a
hardy
race
equipped
in
jackboots
and
trowsers
up
to
their
middle
rode
post
through
thick
and
thin
and
guarded
against
the
mire
defied
the
frequent
stumble
and
fall
arose
and
pursued
their
journey
with
alacrity
while
in
these
days
their
enervated
posterity
sleep
away
their
rapid
journeys
in
easy
chaises
fitted
for
the
conveyance
of
the
soft
inhabitants
of
sybaris
no
wonder
therefore
that
a
great
deal
of
the
travelling
of
the
country
continued
to
be
performed
on
horseback
this
being
by
far
the
pleasantest
as
well
as
most
expeditious
mode
of
journeying
on
his
johnson
rode
from
birmingham
to
derby
with
his
tetty
taking
the
opportunity
of
the
journey
to
give
his
bride
her
first
lesson
in
marital
discipline
at
a
later
period
james
watt
rode
from
glasgow
to
london
when
proceeding
thither
to
learn
the
art
of
mathematical
instrument
making
and
it
was
a
cheap
and
pleasant
method
of
travelling
when
the
weather
was
fine
the
usual
practice
was
to
buy
a
horse
at
the
beginning
of
such
a
journey
and
to
sell
the
animal
at
the
end
of
it
skene
of
aberdeen
travelled
from
london
to
edinburgh
in
being
nineteen
days
on
the
road
the
whole
expenses
of
the
journey
amounting
to
only
four
guineas
the
mare
on
which
he
rode
cost
him
eight
guineas
in
london
and
he
sold
her
for
the
same
price
on
his
arrival
in
edinburgh
nearly
all
the
commercial
gentlemen
rode
their
own
horses
carrying
their
samples
and
luggage
in
two
bags
at
the
and
hence
their
appellation
of
riders
or
bagmen
for
safety
sake
they
usually
journeyed
in
company
for
the
dangers
of
travelling
were
not
confined
merely
to
the
ruggedness
of
the
roads
the
highways
were
infested
by
troops
of
robbers
and
vagabonds
who
lived
by
plunder
turpin
and
bradshaw
beset
the
great
north
road
duval
macheath
maclean
and
hundreds
of
notorious
highwaymen
infested
hounslow
heath
finchley
common
shooter
hill
and
all
the
approaches
to
the
metropolis
a
very
common
sight
then
was
a
gibbet
erected
by
the
roadside
with
the
skeleton
of
some
malefactor
hanging
from
it
in
chains
and
were
especially
numerous
in
the
neighbourhood
of
london
it
was
considered
most
unsafe
to
travel
after
dark
and
when
the
first
night
coach
was
started
the
risk
was
thought
too
great
and
it
was
not
patronised
image
the
night
coach
travellers
armed
themselves
on
setting
out
upon
a
journey
as
if
they
were
going
to
battle
and
a
blunderbuss
was
considered
as
indispensable
for
a
coachman
as
a
whip
dorsetshire
and
hampshire
like
most
other
counties
were
beset
with
gangs
of
highwaymen
and
when
the
grand
duke
cosmo
set
out
from
dorchester
to
travel
to
london
in
he
was
convoyed
by
a
great
many
belonging
to
the
militia
of
the
county
to
secure
him
from
robbers
thoresby
in
his
diary
alludes
with
awe
to
his
having
passed
safely
the
great
common
where
sir
ralph
wharton
slew
the
highwayman
and
he
also
makes
special
mention
of
stonegate
hole
a
notorious
robbing
place
near
grantham
like
every
other
traveller
that
good
man
carried
loaded
pistols
in
his
bags
and
on
one
occasion
he
was
thrown
into
great
consternation
near
topcliffe
in
yorkshire
on
missing
them
believing
that
they
had
been
abstracted
by
some
designing
rogues
at
the
inn
where
he
had
last
slept
no
wonder
that
before
setting
out
on
a
journey
in
those
days
men
were
accustomed
to
make
their
wills
when
calderwood
of
coltness
travelled
from
edinburgh
to
london
in
she
relates
in
her
diary
that
she
travelled
in
her
own
postchaise
attended
by
john
rattray
her
stout
serving
man
on
horseback
with
pistols
at
his
holsters
and
a
good
broad
sword
by
his
side
the
lady
had
also
with
her
in
the
carriage
a
case
of
pistols
for
use
upon
an
emergency
robberies
were
then
of
frequent
occurrence
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bawtry
in
yorkshire
and
one
day
a
character
whom
they
took
to
be
a
highwayman
made
his
appearance
but
john
rattray
talking
about
powder
and
ball
to
the
postboy
and
showing
his
whanger
the
fellow
made
off
calderwood
started
from
edinburgh
on
the
of
june
when
the
roads
were
dry
and
the
weather
was
fine
and
she
reached
london
on
the
evening
of
the
which
was
considered
a
rapid
journey
in
those
days
the
danger
however
from
footpads
and
highwaymen
was
not
greatest
in
remote
country
places
but
in
and
about
the
metropolis
itself
the
proprietors
of
bellsize
house
and
gardens
in
the
then
one
of
the
principal
places
of
amusement

the
way
to
london
patrolled
during
the
season
by
twelve
lusty
fellows
and
sadler
wells
vauxhall
and
ranelagh
advertised
similar
advantages
foot
passengers
proceeding
towards
kensington
and
paddington
in
the
evening
would
wait
until
a
sufficiently
numerous
band
had
collected
to
set
footpads
at
defiance
and
then
they
started
in
company
at
known
intervals
of
which
a
bell
gave
due
warning
carriages
were
stopped
in
broad
daylight
in
hyde
park
and
even
in
piccadilly
itself
and
pistols
presented
at
the
breasts
of
fashionable
people
who
were
called
upon
to
deliver
up
their
purses
horace
walpole
relates
a
number
of
curious
instances
of
this
sort
he
himself
having
been
robbed
in
broad
day
with
lord
eglinton
sir
thomas
robinson
lady
albemarle
and
many
more
a
curious
robbery
of
the
portsmouth
mail
in
illustrates
the
imperfect
postal
communication
of
the
period
the
boy
who
carried
the
post
had
dismounted
at
hammersmith
about
three
miles
from
hyde
park
corner
and
called
for
beer
when
some
thieves
took
the
opportunity
of
cutting
the
from
off
the
horse
crupper
and
got
away
undiscovered
the
means
adopted
for
the
transport
of
merchandise
were
as
tedious
and
difficult
as
those
ordinarily
employed
for
the
conveyance
of
passengers
corn
and
wool
were
sent
to
market
on
backs
manure
was
carried
to
the
fields
in
panniers
and
fuel
was
conveyed
from
the
moss
or
the
forest
in
the
same
way
during
the
winter
months
the
markets
were
inaccessible
and
while
in
some
localities
the
supplies
of
food
were
distressingly
deficient
in
others
the
superabundance
actually
rotted
from
the
impossibility
of
consuming
it
or
of
transporting
it
to
places
where
it
was
needed
the
little
coal
used
in
the
southern
counties
was
principally
though
occasionally
carried
coal
inland
for
the
supply
of

brought
on
horses

from
ancaster
in
lincolnshire
miles
distant
and
they
loaded
back
with
coal

was
taken
in
exchange
for
the

the
convoy
the
little
trade
which
existed
between
one
part
of
the
kingdom
and
another
was
carried
on
by
means
of
packhorses
along
roads
little
better
than
these
horses
travelled
in
lines
with
the
bales
or
panniers
strapped
across
their
backs
the
foremost
horse
bore
a
bell
or
a
collar
of
bells
and
was
hence
called
the
he
was
selected
because
of
his
sagacity
and
by
the
tinkling
of
the
bells
he
carried
the
movements
of
his
followers
were
regulated
the
bells
also
gave
notice
of
the
approach
of
the
convoy
to
those
who
might
be
advancing
from
the
opposite
direction
this
was
a
matter
of
some
importance
as
in
many
parts
of
the
path
there
was
not
room
for
two
loaded
horses
to
pass
each
other
and
quarrels
and
fights
between
the
drivers
of
the
trains
were
frequent
as
to
which
of
the
meeting
convoys
was
to
pass
down
into
the
dirt
and
allow
the
other
to
pass
along

bridleway

when
smollett
went
from

to

he
travelled
partly
on
partly
by
waggon
and
partly
on
foot
and
the
adventures
which
he
described
as
having
befallen
roderick
random
are
supposed
to
have
been
drawn
in
a
great
measure
from
his
own
experiences
during
the
journey
a

traffic
gradually
sprang
up
between
the
northern
counties

districts
of

of

of
the

in

this

the

the
conduct
of

no

their

that
the

would

furthermore
they
hinder

in

the

argument
was
used
against

because
many
would
be
necessitated
to
keep
a
good
horse
that
keeps
none
now
seeing
then
that
there
are
few
that
are
gainers
by
them
and
that
they
are
against
the

general
good
of
the

are
only
a
conveniency

therefore
there
is
good
reason
they
should
be
suppressed
not
but
that
it
may
be
lawful
to

the

knew
next
to

of

when
a
shower
of
rain
had
the
effect
of
rendering
the

impassable
even
horsemen
were
cautious
in
venturing
far
from

only
a

limited
number
of
persons
could
then
afford
to
travel
on
horseback
the
labouring
people
journeyed
on

while
the
middle

used

the

but
the
amount
of
intercourse
between
the
people
of
different
districts
then
exceedingly
limited
at

times
was
in
a
country
so
wet
as
england
necessarily
suspended
for
all
classes
during
the
greater
part
of

the
imperfect
communication
existing
between

had
the
effect
of
perpetuating
numerous
local

local
prejudices
and
local

which
survive
to

though
they
are
rapidly
disappearing

the
regret
of
many
under
the
influence

every
village
had
its
witches
sometimes
of
different
sorts
and
there
was
scarcely
an
old
house

had
its

excepting
perhaps
in
a

where

may
still

it
is
curious
to
find
that
down
even
to
the
beginning
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
inhabitants
of
the
southern
districts
of
the

regarded
those
of

with
a
kind
of
dread
but
determined
at
length
to
run
the
hazard
of
the
attempt
trusting
in

divine
assistance
camden
was
exposed
to
still
greater
risks
in
his
survey
of
cumberland
when
he
went
into
that
county
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
the
remains
of
antiquity
it
contained
for
the
purposes
of
his
great
work
he
travelled
along
the
line
of
the
roman
wall
as
far
as
thirlwall
castle
near
haltwhistle
but
there
the
limits
of
civilization
and
security
ended
for
such
was
the
wildness
of
the
country
and
of
its
lawless
inhabitants
beyond
that
he
was
obliged
to
desist
from
his
pilgrimage
and
leave
the
most
important
and
interesting
objects
of
his
journey

a

rector

as
if

set
out

so
soon
as

his
friends
convoyed
him
on
the
first
stage
of
his
journey

left
him

him
to
the
divine
protection
he
was
however
careful
to
employ
guides
to
conduct
him
from
one
place
to
another
and
in
the
course
of
his
three
years
travels
he
saw
many
new
and
wonderful
things
he
was
under
the
necessity
of
suspending
his
travels
when
the
winter
or
wet
weather
set
in
and
to
lay
up
like
an
arctic
voyager
for
several
months
until
the
spring
came
round
again
brome
passed
through
northumberland
into
scotland
then
down
the
western
side
of
the
island
towards
devonshire
where
he
found
the
farmers
gathering
in
their
corn
on
the
roads
being
so
narrow
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
use
waggons
he
desired
to
travel
into
cornwall
the
boundaries
of
which
he
reached

was
prevented
proceeding
farther
by
the
rains
and
accordingly
he
made

the

was
considered
a
wonderful
man

more
widely

were

great
an
excitement

of

which
has

where
the
are
gone
and
the
and
the
slow
waggons
and
the
pedlars
who
brought
bargains
to
the
door
on
sunny
afternoons
old
leisure
lived
chiefly
in
the
country
among
pleasant
seats
and
homesteads
and
was
fond
of
sauntering
by
the
walls
and
scenting
the
apricots
when
they
were
warmed
by
the
morning
sunshine
or
sheltering
himself
under
the
orchard
boughs
at
noon
when
the
summer
pears
were
falling
but
this
picture
has
also
its
obverse
side
whole
generations
then
lived
a
monotonous
ignorant
prejudiced
and
humdrum
life
they
had
no
enterprize
no
energy
little
industry
and
were
content
to
die
where
they
were
born
the
seclusion
in
which
they
were
compelled
to
live
produced
a
picturesqueness
of
manners
which
is
pleasant
to
look
back
upon
now
that
it
is
a
thing
of
the
past
but
it
was
also
accompanied
with
a
degree
of
grossness
and
brutality
much
less
pleasant
to
regard

of
which
the
occasional
popular
amusements
of

the

beyond

as
good
as
closed
against
them
almost
the
only
intelligence
of
general
affairs
which
reached
them
was
communicated
by
pedlars

who
were
accustomed
to
retail
to
their
customers
the
news
of

with
articles
for
general
use
the
country
people
were
irregularly
supplied
by
hawkers
who
sometimes
bore
their
whole
stook
upon
their
back
or
occasionally
on
that
of
their
pots
pans
and
household
utensils
were
sold
from
door
to
door
until
a
comparatively
recent
period
the
whole
of
the
manufactured
in
staffordshire
was
hawked
about
and
disposed
of
in
this
way
the
pedlars
carried
frames
resembling
on
which
they
were
accustomed
to
display
their
wares
when
the
opportunity
occurred
for
showing
them
to
advantage
the
articles
which
they
sold
were
chiefly
of
a
fanciful
kind
ribbons
laces
and
female
finery
the
great
reliance
for
the
supply
of
general
clothing
in
those
days
being
on
domestic
industry
every
autumn
the
mistress
of
the
household
was
accustomed
to
lay
in
a
store
of
articles
sufficient
to
serve
for
the
entire
winter
it
was
like
laying
in
a
stock
of
provisions
and
clothing
for
a
siege
during
the
time
that
the
roads
were
closed
the
greater
part
of
the
meat
required
for
winter
use
was
killed
and
salted
down
at
martinmas
while
stockfish
and
baconed
herrings
were
provided
for
lent
scatcherd
says
that
in
his
district
the
clothiers
united
in
groups
of
three
or
four
and
at
the
leeds
winter
fair
they
would
purchase
an
ox
which
having
divided
they
salted
and
hung
the
pieces
for
their
winter
food
there
was
also
the
stock
of
firewood
to
be
provided
and
the
rushes
with
which
to
strew
the
floors
carpets
being
a
comparatively
modern
invention
besides
there
was
the
store
of
wheat
and
barley
for
bread
the
malt
for
ale
the
honey
for
sweetening
then
used
for
sugar
the
salt
the
spiceries
and
the
savoury
herbs
so
much
employed
in
the
ancient
cookery
when
the
stores
were
laid
in
the
housewife
was
in
a
position
to
bid
defiance
to
bad
roads
for
six
months
to
come
this
was
the
case
of
the
but
the
poorer
classes
who
could
not
lay
in
a
store
for
winter
were
often
very
badly
off
both
for
food
and
firing
and
in
many
hard
seasons
they
literally
starved
but
charity
was
active
in
those
days
and
many
a
poor
man
store
was
eked
out
by
his
wealthier
neighbour
when
the
household
supply
was
thus
laid
in
the
mistress
with
her
daughters
and
servants
sat
down
to
their
distaffs
and
for
the
manufacture
of
the
family
clothing
was
usually
the
work
of
the
winter
months
the
fabrics
then
worn
were
almost
entirely
of
wool
silk
and
cotton
being
scarcely
known
the
wool
when
not
grown
on
the
farm
was
purchased
in
a
raw
state
and
was
carded
spun
dyed
and
in
many
cases
woven
at
home
so
also
with
the
linen
clothing
which
until
quite
a
recent
date
was
entirely
the
produce
of
female
fingers
and
household
this
kind
of
work
occupied
the
winter
months
occasionally
alternated
with
knitting
embroidery
and
tapestry
work
many
of
our
country
houses
continue
to
bear
witness
to
the
steady
industry
of
the
ladies
of
even
the
highest
ranks
in
those
times
in
the
fine
tapestry
hangings
with
which
the
walls
of
many
of
the
older
rooms
in
such
mansions
are
covered
among
the
humbler
classes
the
same
winter
work
went
on
the
women
sat
round
log
fires
knitting
plaiting
and
spinning
by
even
in
the
daytime
glass
had
not
yet
come
into
general
use
and
the
openings
in
the
wall
which
in
served
for
windows
had
necessarily
to
be
shut
close
with
boards
to
keep
out
the
cold
though
at
the
same
time
they
shut
out
the
light
the
chimney
usually
of
lath
and
plaster
ending
overhead
in
a
cone
and
funnel
for
the
smoke
was
so
roomy
in
old
cottages
as
to
accommodate
almost
the
whole
family
sitting
around
the
fire
of
logs
piled
in
the
reredosse
in
the
middle
and
there
they
carried
on
their
winter
work
such
was
the
domestic
occupation
of
women
in
the
rural
districts
in
olden
times
and
it
may
perhaps
be
questioned
whether
the
revolution
in
our
social
system
which
has
taken
out
of
their
hands
so
many
branches
of
household
manufacture
and
useful
domestic
employment
be
an
altogether
unmixed
blessing
winter
at
an
end
and
the
roads
once
more
available
for
travelling
the
fair
of
the
locality
was
looked
forward
to
with
interest
fairs
were
among
the
most
important
institutions
of
past
times
and
were
rendered
necessary
by
the
imperfect
road
communications
the
right
of
holding
them
was
regarded
as
a
valuable
privilege
conceded
by
the
sovereign
to
the
lords
of
the
manors
who
adopted
all
manner
of
devices
to
draw
crowds
to
their
markets
they
were
usually
held
at
the
entrances
to
valleys
closed
against
locomotion
during
winter
or
in
the
middle
of
rich
grazing
districts
or
more
frequently
in
the
neighbourhood
of
famous
cathedrals
or
churches
frequented
by
flocks
of
pilgrims
the
devotion
of
the
people
being
turned
to
account
many
of
the
fairs
were
held
on
sundays
in
the
churchyards
and
almost
in
every
parish
a
market
was
instituted
on
the
day
on
which
the
parishioners
were
called
together
to
do
honour
to
their
patron
saint
the
local
fair
which
was
usually
held
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
winter
often
at
both
times
became
the
great
festival
as
well
as
market
of
the
district
and
the
business
as
well
as
the
gaiety
of
the
neighbourhood
usually
centred
on
such
occasions
high
courts
were
held
by
the
bishop
or
lord
of
the
manor
to
accommodate
which
special
buildings
were
erected
used
only
at
fair
time
among
the
fairs
of
the
first
class
in
england
were
winchester
town
boston
and
ives
we
find
the
great
london
merchants
travelling
thither
in
caravans
bearing
with
them
all
manner
of
goods
and
bringing
back
the
wool
purchased
by
them
in
exchange
winchester
great
fair
attracted
merchants
from
all
parts
of
europe
it
was
held
on
the
hill
of
giles
and
was
divided
into
streets
of
booths
named
after
the
merchants
of
the
different
countries
who
exposed
their
wares
in
them
the
passes
through
the
great
woody
districts
which
english
merchants
coming
from
london
and
the
west
would
be
compelled
to
traverse
were
on
this
occasion
carefully
guarded
by
mounted
since
the
wealth
which
was
being
conveyed
to
attracted
bands
of
outlaws
from
all
parts
of
the
country
weyhill
fair
near
andover
was
another
of
the
great
fairs
in
the
same
district
which
was
to
the
west
country
agriculturists
and
clothiers
what
winchester
giles
fair
was
to
the
general
merchants
the
principal
fair
in
the
northern
districts
was
that
of
botolph
town
boston
which
was
resorted
to
by
people
from
great
distances
to
buy
and
sell
commodities
of
various
kinds
thus
we
find
from
the
of
bolton
priory
that
the
monks
of
that
house
sent
their
wool
to
botolph
fair
to
be
sold
though
it
was
a
good
hundred
miles
distant
buying
in
return
their
winter
supply
of
groceries
spiceries
and
other
necessary
articles
that
fair
too
was
often
beset
by
robbers
and
on
one
occasion
a
strong
party
of
them
under
the
disguise
of
monks
attacked
and
robbed
certain
booths
setting
fire
to
the
rest
and
such
was
the
amount
of
destroyed
wealth
that
it
is
said
the
veins
of
molten
gold
and
silver
ran
along
the
streets
the
concourse
of
persons
attending
these
fairs
was
immense
the
nobility
and
gentry
the
heads
of
the
religions
houses
the
yeomanry
and
the
commons
resorted
to
them
to
buy
and
sell
all
manner
of
agricultural
produce
the
farmers
there
sold
their
wool
and
cattle
and
hired
their
servants
while
their
wives
disposed
of
the
surplus
produce
of
their
winter
industry
and
bought
their
cutlery
bijouterie
and
more
tasteful
articles
of
apparel
there
were
caterers
there
for
all
customers
and
stuffs
and
wares
were
offered
for
sale
from
all
countries
and
in
the
wake
of
this
business
part
of
the
fair
there
invariably
followed
a
crowd
of
ministers
to
the
popular
tastes
quack
doctors
and
merry
andrews
jugglers
and
minstrels
singlestick
players
grinners
through
and
sportmakers
of
every
kind
smaller
fairs
were
held
in
most
districts
for
similar
purposes
of
exchange
at
these
the
staples
of
the
locality
were
sold
and
servants
usually
hired
many
were
for
special
purposes
cattle
fairs
leather
fairs
cloth
fairs
bonnet
fairs
fruit
fairs
scatcherd
says
that
less
than
a
century
ago
a
large
fair
was
held
between
huddersfield
and
leeds
in
a
field
still
called
fairstead
near
birstal
which
used
to
be
a
great
mart
for
fruit
onions
and
such
like
and
that
the
clothiers
resorted
thither
from
all
the
country
round
to
purchase
the
articles
which
were
stowed
away
in
barns
and
sold
at
booths
by
lamplight
in
the
morning
even
dartmoor
had
its
fair
on
the
site
of
an
ancient
british
village
or
temple
near
merivale
bridge
testifying
to
its
great
antiquity
for
it
is
surprising
how
an
ancient
fair
lingers
about
the
place
on
which
it
has
been
accustomed
to
be
held
long
after
the
necessity
for
it
has
ceased
the
site
of
this
old
fair
at
merivale
bridge
is
the
more
curious
as
in
its
immediate
neighbourhood
on
the
road
between
two
bridges
and
tavistock
is
found
the
granite
rock
bearing
so
remarkable
a
resemblance
to
the
egyptian
sphynx
in
a
mutilated
state
it
is
of
similarly
colossal
proportions
and
stands
in
a
district
almost
as
lonely
as
that
in
which
the
egyptian
sphynx
looks
forth
over
the
sands
of
the
memphean
desert
image
site
of
an
ancient
british
village
and
fair
on
dartmoor
the
last
occasion
on
which
the
fair
was
held
in
this
secluded
spot
was
in
the
year
when
the
plague
raged
at
tavistock
and
there
is
a
part
of
the
ground
situated
amidst
a
line
of
pillars
marking
a
stone
avenue
a
characteristic
feature
of
the
ancient
aboriginal
worship
which
is
to
this
day
pointed
out
and
called
by
the
name
of
the
potatoe
market
but
the
glory
of
the
great
fairs
has
long
since
departed
they
declined
with
the
extension
of
turnpikes
and
railroads
gave
them
their
shops
now
exist
in
every
little
town
and
village
drawing
their
supplies
regularly
by
road
and
canal
from
the
most
distant
parts
bartholomew
the
great
fair
of
london
and
donnybrook
the
great
fair
of
dublin
have
been
suppressed
as
nuisances
and
nearly
all
that
remains
of
the
dead
but
long
potent
institution
of
the
fair
is
the
occasional
exhibition
at
periodic
times
in
country
places
of
ladies
dwarfs
giants
calves
and
wonders
amidst
a
blatant
clangour
of
drums
gongs
and
cymbals
like
the
sign
of
the
over
the
village
inn
door
the
modern
village
fair
of
which
the
principal
article
of
merchandise
is
is
but
the
vestige
of
a
state
of
things
that
has
long
since
passed
away
there
were
however
remote
and
almost
impenetrable
districts
which
long
resisted
modern
inroads
of
such
was
dartmoor
which
we
have
already
more
than
once
referred
to
the
difficulties
of
in
that
quarter
as
well
as
the
sterility
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
moor
had
the
effect
of
preventing
its
becoming
opened
up
to
modern
traffic
and
it
is
accordingly
curious
to
find
how
much
of
its
old
manners
customs
traditions
and
language
has
been
preserved
it
looks
like
a
piece
of
england
of
the
middle
ages
left
behind
on
the
march
witches
still
hold
their
sway
on
dartmoor
where
there
exist
no
less
than
three
distinct
kinds
white
black
and
grey
and
there
are
still
professors
of
witchcraft
male
as
well
as
female
in
most
of
the
villages
as
might
be
expected
the
held
their
ground
in
dartmoor
the
longest
and
in
some
parts
of
north
devon
they
are
not
yet
extinct
when
our
artist
was
in
the
neighbourhood
sketching
the
ancient
bridge
on
the
moor
and
the
site
of
the
old
fair
a
farmer
said
to
him
i
well
remember
the
train
of
and
the
effect
of
their
jingling
bells
on
the
silence
of
dartmoor
my
grandfather
a
respectable
farmer
in
the
north
of
devon
was
the
first
to
use
a
a
square
box
without
wheels
dragged
by
a
horse
to
carry
manure
to
field
he
was
also
the
first
man
in
the
district
to
use
an
umbrella
which
on
sundays
he
hung
in
the
an
object
of
curiosity
to
the
villagers
we
are
also
informed
by
a
gentleman
who
resided
for
some
time
at
south
brent
on
the
borders
of
the
moor
that
the
introduction
of
the
first
cart
in
that
district
is
remembered
by
many
now
living
the
bridges
having
been
shortly
afterwards
widened
to
accommodate
the
wheeled
vehicles
the
primitive
features
of
this
secluded
district
are
perhaps
best
represented
by
the
interesting
little
town
of
chagford
situated
in
the
valley
of
the
north
teign
an
ancient
stannary
and
market
town
backed
by
a
wide
stretch
of
moor
the
houses
of
the
place
are
built
of
moor
stone
grey
and
substantial
some
with
projecting
porch
and
parvise
room
over
and
windows
the
ancient
church
built
of
granite
with
a
stout
old
steeple
of
the
same
material
its
embattled
porch
and
vault
springing
from
low
columns
with
capitals
forming
the
sturdy
centre
of
this
ancient
town
clump
a
is
still
a
phenomenon
in
chagford
the
roads
and
lanes
leading
to
it
being
so
steep
and
rugged
as
to
be
ill
adapted
for
springed
vehicles
of
any
sort
the
upland
road
or
track
to
tavistock
scales
an
almost
precipitous
hill
and
though
well
enough
adapted
for
the
of
the
last
century
it
is
quite
unfitted
for
the
cart
and
waggon
traffic
of
this
hence
the
horse
with
panniers
maintains
its
ground
in
the
chagford
district
and
the
furnished
with
a
pillion
for
the
lady
riding
behind
is
still
to
be
met
with
in
the
country
roads
among
the
patriarchs
of
the
hills
the
blue
coat
may
yet
be
seen
with
the
shoe
fastened
with
buckle
and
strap
as
in
the
days
when
george
iii
was
king
and
old
women
are
still
found
retaining
the
cloak
and
hood
of
their
youth
old
agricultural
implements
continue
in
use
the
slide
or
sledge
is
seen
in
the
fields

flail

its
monotonous
strokes

from
the
the
corn

sifted
by
the
windstow
the
wind
merely
blowing
away
the
chaff
from
the
grain
when
shaken
out
of
sieves
by
the
motion
of
the
hand
on
some
elevated
spot
the
old
wooden
plough
is
still
at
work
and
the
goad
is
still
used
to
urge
the

the
devonshire
crooks
in
such
a
place
as
chagford
says
rowe
the
cooper
or
rough
carpenter
will
still
find
a
demand
for
the
with
its
accompanying
furniture
of
crooks
crubs
or
before
the
general
introduction
of
carts
these
rough
and
ready
contrivances
were
found
of
great
utility
in
the
various
operations
of
husbandry
and
still
prove
exceedingly
convenient

situations
almost
or
altogether
inaccessible

and

light
materials
the
writer
of
one
of
the
happiest
effusions
of
the
local
muse
with
fidelity
to
nature
equal
to
cowper
or
crabbe
has
introduced
the
figure
of
a
devonshire
bending
under
the
load
of
the
crooks
as
an
emblem
of
care
toiling
along
the
narrow
and
rugged
path
of
life
the
force
and
point
of
the
imagery
must
be
lost
to
those
who
have
never
seen
and
as
in
an
instance
which
came
under
my
own
knowledge
never
heard
of
this
unique
specimen
of
provincial
agricultural
machinery
the
crooks
are
formed
of
two
poles
about
ten
feet
long
bent
when
green
into
the
required
curve
and
when
dried
in
that
shape
are
connected
by
horizontal
bars
a
pair
of
crooks
thus
completed
is
slung
over
the
one
on
each
side
to
make
the
balance
true
the
short
crooks
or
crubs
are
slung
in
a
similar
manner
these
are
of
stouter
fabric
and
angular
shape
and
are
used
for
carrying
logs
of
wood
and
other
heavy
materials
the
as

for

london

fearing
lest

should
be
destroyed
by
the
competition
of

but
the
extension
of
the
roads
had
become
a
matter
of
absolute
necessity
in
order
to
feed
the
huge
and

of
the
great
metropolis
the
population
of
which
has
grown
in
about
two

four

enormous

not

did
so
much
in

course
of
his

to

were
if

even
worse
than
those
of

about
the

of

the

was

the

were

indeed
nothing

than
the
aspect
which
scotland
then
presented
her
fields
lay
untilled
her

unexplored
and
her

uncultivated
the
scotch
towns
were
for
the
most
part
collections
of

giving
scant
shelter
to
a
miserable
population
the
whole

of

of

that

were
so
benumbed

oppression
and
poverty
that
the
most
able
instructors
in
husbandry
could
have
made
nothing
of
them
a
writer
in
the

sums
up
his
account
of
scotland
at
that
time
in
these
words
except
in
a
few
instances
it
was
little
better
than
a
barren
waste
the
modern
traveller
through
the
lothians
which
now
exhibit
perhaps
the
finest
agriculture
in
the
world
will
scarcely
believe
that
less
than
a
century
ago
these
counties
were
mostly
in
the
state
in
which
nature
had
left
them
in
the
interior
there
was
little
to
be
seen
but
bleak
moors
and
quaking
bogs
the
chief
part
of
each
farm
consisted
of
or
unenclosed
land
no
better
than
moorland
from
which
the
hardy
black
cattle
could
scarcely
gather
herbage
enough
in
winter
to
keep
them
from
starving
the
was
an
enclosed
patch
of
illcultivated
ground
on
which
oats
and
bear
or
barley
were
grown
but
the
principal
crop
was
weeds
of
the
small
quantity
of
corn
raised
in
the
country
were
grown
within
five
miles
of
the
coast
and
of
wheat
very
little
was
raised
not
a
blade
north
of
the
lothians
when
the
first
crop
of
that
grain
was
tried
on
a
field
near
edinburgh
about
the
middle
of
last
century
people
flocked
to
it
as
a
wonder
clover
turnips
and
potatoes
had
not
yet
been
introduced
and
no
cattle
were
fattened
it
was
with
difficulty
they
could
be
kept
alive
all
loads
were
as
yet
carried
on
horseback
but
when
the
farm
was
too
small
or
the
crofter
too
poor
to
keep
a
horse
his
own
or
his
wife
back
bore
the
load
the
horse
brought
peats
from
the
bog
carried
the
oats
or
barley
to
market
and
bore
the
manure
but
the
uses
of
manure
were
as
yet
so
little
understood
that
if
a
stream
were
near
it
was
usually
thrown
in
and
floated
away
and
in
summer
it
was
burnt
what
will
scarcely
be
credited
now
that
the
industry
of
scotland
has
become
educated
by
a
century
discipline
of
work
was
the
inconceivable
listlessness
and
idleness
of
the
people
they
left
the
bog
unreclaimed
and
the
swamp
undrained
they
would
not
be
at
the
trouble
to
enclose
lands
easily
capable
of
cultivation
there
was
perhaps
but
little
inducement
on
the
part
of
the
agricultural
class
to
be
industrious
for
they
were
too
liable
to
be
robbed
by
those
who
preferred
to
be
idle
andrew
fletcher
of
saltoun
commonly
known
as
the
patriot
because
he
was
so
strongly
opposed
to
the
union
of
scotland
with
published
a
pamphlet
in
strikingly
illustrative
of
the
lawless
and
uncivilized
state
of
the
country
at
that
time
after
giving
a
dreadful
picture
of
the
then
state
of
scotland
two
hundred
thousand
vagabonds
begging
from
door
to
door
and
robbing
and
plundering
the
poor
people
in
years
of
plenty
many
thousands
of
them
meeting
together
in
the
mountains
where
they
feast
and
riot
for
many
days
and
at
country
weddings
markets
burials
and
other
like
public
occasions
they
are
to
be
seen
both
men
and
women
perpetually
drunk
cursing
blaspheming
and
fighting
together
he
proceeded
to
urge
that
every
man
of
a
certain
estate
should
be
obliged
to
take
a
proportionate
number
of
these
vagabonds
and
compel
them
to
work
for
him
and
further
that
such
serfs
with
their
wives
and
children
should
be
incapable
of
alienating
their
service
from
their
master
or
owner
until
he
had
been
reimbursed
for
the
money
he
had
expended
on
them
in
other
words
their
owner
was
to
have
the
power
of
selling
them
the
patriot
was
however
aware
that
great
address
diligence
and
severity
were
required
to
carry
out
his
scheme
for
said
he
that
sort
of
people
are
so
desperately
wicked
such
enemies
of
all
work
and
labour
and
which
is
yet
more
amazing
so
proud
in
esteeming
their
own
condition
above
that
which
they
will
be
sure
to
call
slavery
that
unless
prevented
by
the
utmost
industry
and
diligence
upon
the
first
publication
of
any
orders
necessary
for
putting
in
execution
such
a
design
they
will
rather
die
with
hunger
in
caves
and
dens
and
murder
their
young
children
than
appear
abroad
to
have
them
and
themselves
taken
into
such
service
although
the
recommendations
of
andrew
fletcher
of
saltoun
were
embodied
in
no
act
of
parliament
the
magistrates
of
some
of
the
larger
towns
did
not
hesitate
to
kidnap
and
sell
into
slavery
lads
and
men
found
lurking
in
the
streets
which
they
continued
to
do
down
to
a
comparatively
recent
period
this
however
was
not
so
surprising
as
that
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
and
indeed
until
the
end
of
last
century
there
was
a
veritable
slave
class
in
scotland
the
class
of
colliers
and
salters
who
were
bought
and
sold
with
the
estates
to
which
they
belonged
as
forming
part
of
the
stook
when
they
ran
away
they
were
advertised
for
as
negroes
were
in
the
american
states
until
within
the
last
few
years
it
is
curious
in
turning
over
an
old
volume
of
the
magazine
to
find
a
general
assembly
petition
to
parliament
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
america
almost
alongside
the
report
of
a
trial
of
some
colliers
who
had
absconded
from
a
mine
near
stirling
to
which
they
belonged
but
the
degraded
condition
of
the
home
slaves
then
excited
comparatively
little
interest
indeed
it
was
not
until
the
very
last
year
of
the
last
century
that
praedial
slavery
was
abolished
in
scotland
only
three
short
reigns
ago
almost
within
the
memory
of
men
still
living
the
greatest
resistance
was
offered
to
the
introduction
of
improvements
in
agriculture
though
it
was
only
at
rare
intervals
that
these
were
attempted
there
was
no
class
possessed
of
enterprise
or
wealth
an
idea
of
the
general
poverty
of
the
country
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
about
the
middle
of
last
century
the
whole
circulating
medium
of
the
two
edinburgh
banks
the
only
institutions
of
the
kind
then
in
scotland
amounted
to
only
which
was
sufficient
for
the
purposes
of
trade
commerce
and
industry
money
was
then
so
scarce
that
adam
smith
says
it
was
not
uncommon
for
workmen
in
certain
parts
of
scotland
to
carry
nails
instead
of
pence
to
the
baker
or
the
alehouse
a
middle
class
could
scarcely
as
yet
be
said
to
exist
or
any
condition
between
the
starving
cottiers
and
the
impoverished
proprietors
whose
available
means
were
principally
expended
in
hard
drinking
the
latter
were
for
the
most
part
too
proud
and
too
ignorant
to
interest
themselves
in
the
improvement
of
their
estates
and
the
few
who
did
so
had
very
little
encouragement
to
persevere
miss
craig
in
describing
the
efforts
made
by
her
father
william
craig
laird
of
arbigland
in
kirkcudbright
says
the
indolent
obstinacy
of
the
lower
class
of
the
people
was
found
to
be
almost
unconquerable
amongst
other
instances
of
their
laziness
i
have
heard
him
say
that
upon
the
introduction
of
the
mode
of
dressing
the
grain
at
night
which
had
been
thrashed
during
the
day
all
the
servants
in
the
neighbourhood
refused
to
adopt
the
measure
and
even
threatened
to
destroy
the
houses
of
their
employers
by
fire
if
they
continued
to
insist
upon
the
business
my
father
speedily
perceived
that
a
forcible
remedy
was
required
for
the
evil
he
gave
his
servants
the
choice
of
removing
the
thrashed
grain
in
the
evening
or
becoming
inhabitants
of
kirkcudbright
gaol
they
preferred
the
former
alternative
and
open
murmurings
were
no
longer
heard
the
wages
paid
to
the
labouring
classes
were
then
very
low
even
in
east
lothian
which
was
probably
in
advance
of
the
other
scotch
counties
the
ordinary
day
wage
of
a
labouring
man
was
only
five
pence
in
winter
and
six
pence
in
summer
their
food
was
wholly
vegetable
and
was
insufficient
in
quantity
as
well
as
bad
in
quality
the
little
butcher
meat
consumed
by
the
better
class
was
salted
beef
and

stored
up
in

between
michaelmas
and

for

consumption
buchan
hepburn
says
the
sheriff
of
east
lothian
informed
him
that
he
remembered
when
not
a
bullock
was
slaughtered
in
haddington
market
for
a
whole
year
except
at
that
time
and
when
sir
david
kinloch
of
gilmerton
sold
ten
wedders
to
an
edinburgh
butcher
he
stipulated
for
three
several
terms
to
take
them
away
to
prevent
the
edinburgh
market
from
being
overstocked
with
fresh
meat
the
rest
of
scotland
was
in
no
better
state
in
some
parts
it
was
even
worse
the
rich
and
fertile
county
of
ayr
which
now
glories
in
the
name
of
the
garden
of
scotland
was
for
the
most
part
a
wild
and
dreary
waste
with
here
and
there
a
poor
miserable
comfortless
hut
where
the
farmer
and
his
family
lodged
there
were
no
enclosures
of
land
except
one
or
two
about
a
residence
and
black
cattle
roamed
at
large
over
the
face
of
the
country
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
enclose
the
lands
for
the
purposes
of
agriculture
the
fences
were
levelled
by
the
dispossessed
squatters
famines
were
frequent
among
the
poorer
classes
the
western
counties
not
producing
food
enough
for
the
sustenance
of
the
inhabitants
few
though
they
were
in
number
this
was
also
the
case
in
dumfries
where
the
chief
part
of
the
grain
required
for
the
population
was
brought
in
from
the
sandbeds
of
esk
and
when
the
waters
were
high
by
reason
of
spates
or
floods
and
there
being
no
bridges
so
that
the
cars
could
not
come
with
the
meal
the
tradesmen
wives
might
be
seen
in
the
streets
of
dumfries
crying
because
there
was
no
food
to
be
had
the
misery
of
the
country
was
enormously
aggravated
by
the
wretched
state
of
the
roads
there
were
indeed
scarcely
any
made
roads
throughout
the
country
hence
the
communication
between
one
town
and
another
was
always
difficult
especially
in
winter
there
were
only
rough
tracks
across
moors
and
when
one
track
became
too
deep
another
alongside
of
it
was
chosen
and
was
in
its
turn
abandoned
until
the
whole
became
equally
impassable
in
wet
weather
these
tracks
became
mere
sloughs
in
which
the
carts
or
carriages
had
to
slumper
through
in
a
state
whilst
in
times
of
drought
it
was
a
continual
jolting
out
of
one
hole
into
another
such
being
the
state
of
the
highways
it
will
be
obvious
that
very
little
communication
could
exist
between
one
part
of
the
country
and
another
traffickers
called
cadgers
plied
between
the
country
towns
and
the
villages
supplying
the
inhabitants
with
salt
fish
earthenware
and
articles
of
clothing
which
they
carried
in
sacks
or
creels
hung
across
their
backs
even
the
trade
between
edinburgh
and
glasgow
was
carried
on
in
the
same
primitive
way
the
principal
route
being
along
the
high
grounds
west
of
boroughstoness
near
which
the
remains
of
the
old
road
are
still
to
be
seen
it
was
long
before
vehicles
of
any
sort
could
be
used
on
the
scotch
roads
rude
sledges
and
were
employed
near
towns
and
afterwards
carts
the
wheels
of
which
were
first
made
of
boards
it
was
long
before
travelling
by
coach
could
be
introduced
in
scotland
when
smollett
travelled
from
glasgow
to
edinburgh
on
his
way
to
london
in
there
was
neither
coach
cart
nor
waggon
on
the
road
he
accordingly
accompanied
the
carriers
as
far
as
newcastle
sitting
upon
a
between
two
baskets
one
of
which
he
says
contained
my
goods
in
a
knapsack
in
an
attempt
was
made
by
the
town
council
of
glasgow
to
set
up
a
or
lando
it
was
to
be
drawn
by
six
horses
carry
six
passengers
and
run
between
glasgow
and
edinburgh
a
distance
of
miles
once
a
week
in
winter
and
twice
a
week
in
summer
the
project
however
seems
to
have
been
thought
too
bold
for
the
time
for
the
lando
was
never
started
it
was
not
until
the
year
that
the
first
public
conveyance
called
the
glasgow
and
edinburgh
caravan
was
started
between
the
two
cities
and
it
made
the
journey
between
the
one
place
and
the
other
in
two
days
ten
years
later
another
vehicle
was
started
named
the
fly
because
of
its
unusual
speed
and
it
contrived
to
make
the
journey
in
rather
less
than
a
day
and
a
half
about
the
same
time
a
coach
with
four
horses
was
started
between
haddington
and
edinburgh
and
it
took
a
full
winter
day
to
perform
the
journey
of
sixteen
miles
the
effort
being
to
reach
musselburgh
in
time
for
dinner
and
go
into
town
in
the
evening
as
late
as
there
was
as
only
one
in
all
scotland
in
communication
with
london
and
that
set
out
from
edinburgh
only
once
a
month
the
journey
to
london
occupied
from
ten
to
fifteen
days
according
to
the
state
of
the
weather
and
those
who
undertook
so
dangerous
a
journey
usually
took
the
precaution
of
making
their
wills
before
starting
when
carriers
carts
were
established
the
time
occupied
by
them
on
the
road
will
now
appear
almost
incredible
thus
the
common
carrier
between
selkirk
and
edinburgh
a
distance
of
only
miles
took
about
a
fortnight
to
perform
the
double
journey
part
of
the
road
lay
along
gala
water
and
in
summer
time
when
the
was
dry
the
carrier
used
it
as
a
road
the
townsmen
of
this
adventurous
individual
on
the
morning
of
his
were
accustomed
to
turn
out
and
take
leave
of
him
wishing
him
a
safe
return
from
his
perilous
journey
in
winter
the
route
was
simply
impracticable
and
the
communication
was
suspended
until
the
return
of
dry
weather
while
such
was
the
state
of
the
communications
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
of
scotland
matters
were
if
possible
still
worse
in
the
remoter
parts
of
the
country
down
to
the
middle
of
last
century
there
were
no
made
roads
of
any
kind
in
the
counties
the
only
inland
trade
was
in
black
cattle
the
tracks
were
impracticable
for
vehicles
of
which
there
were
only
a
few
carts
and
employed
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
towns
when
the
marquis
of
downshire
attempted
to
make
a
journey
through
galloway
in
his
coach
about
the
year
a
party
of
labourers
with
tools
attended
him
to
lift
the
vehicle
out
of
the
ruts
and
put
on
the
wheels
when
it
got
dismounted
even
with
this
assistance
however
his
lordship
occasionally
stuck
fast
and
when
within
about
three
miles
of
the
village
of
creetown
near
wigton
he
was
obliged
to
send
away
the
attendants
and
pass
the
night
in
his
coach
on
the
corse
of
slakes
with
his
family
matters
were
of
course
still
worse
in
the
highlands
where
the
rugged
character
of
the
country
offered
formidable
difficulties
to
the
formation
of
practicable
roads
and
where
none
existed
save
those
made
through
the
rebel
districts
by
general
wade
shortly
after
the
rebellion
of
the
people
were
also
more
lawless
and
if
possible
more
idle
than
those
of
the
lowland
districts
about
the
same
period
the
latter
regarded
their
northern
neighbours
as
the
settlers
in
america
did
the
red
indians
round
their
borders
like
so
many
savages
always
ready
to
burst
in
upon
them
fire
their
buildings
and
carry
off
their
cattle
very
little
corn
was
grown
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
highlands
on
account
of
its
being
liable
to
be
reaped
and
carried
off
by
the
caterans
and
that
before
it
was
ripe
the
only
method
by
which
security
of
a
certain
sort
could
be
obtained
was
by
the
payment
of
blackmail
to
some
of
the
principal
chiefs
though
this
was
not
sufficient
to
protect
them
against
the
lesser
marauders
regular
contracts
were
drawn
up
between
proprietors
in
the
counties
of
perth
stirling
and
dumbarton
and
the
macgregors
in
which
it
was
stipulated
that
if
less
than
seven
cattle
were
stolen
which
peccadillo
was
known
as
picking
no
redress
should
be
required
but
if
the
number
stolen
exceeded
seven
such
amount
of
theft
being
raised
to
the
dignity
of
lifting
then
the
macgregors
were
bound
to
recover
this
blackmail
was
regularly
levied
as
far
south
as
campsie
then
within
six
miles
of
glasgow
but
now
almost
forming
part
of
it
down
to
within
a
few
months
of
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
of
under
such
circumstances
agricultural
improvement
was
altogether
impossible
the
most
fertile
tracts
were
allowed
to
lie
waste
for
men
would
not
plough
or
sow
where
they
had
not
the
certain
prospect
of
gathering
in
the
crop
another
serious
evil
was
that
the
lawless
habits
of
their
neighbours
tended
to
make
the
lowland
borderers
almost
as
ferocious
as
the
higlanders
themselves
feuds
were
of
constant
occurrence
between
neighbouring
baronies
and
even
contiguous
parishes
and
the
country
fairs
which
were
tacitly
recognised
as
the
occasions
for
settling
quarrels
were
the
scenes
of
as
bloody
faction
fights
as
were
ever
known
in
ireland
even
in
its
worst
days
when
such
was
the
state
of
scotland
only
a
century
ago
what
may
we
not
hope
for
from
ireland
when
the
civilizing
influences
of
roads
schools
and
industry
have
made
more
general
progress
amongst
her
people
yet
scotland
had
not
always
been
in
this
miserable
condition
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
as
early
as
the
thirteenth
century
agriculture
was
in
a
much
more
advanced
state
than
we
find
it
to
have
been
the
eighteenth
it
would
appear
from
the
extant
chartularies
of
monastic
establishments
which
then
existed
all
over
the
lowlands
that
a
considerable
portion
of
their
revenue
was
derived
from
wheat
which
also
formed
no
inconsiderable
part
of
their
living
the
remarkable
fact
is
mentioned
by
walter
de
hemingford
the
english
historian
that
when
the
castle
of
dirleton
in
east
lothian
was
besieged
by
the
army
of
edward
in
the
beginning
of
july
the
men
being
reduced
to
great
extremities
for
provisions
were
fain
to
subsist
on
the
pease
and
beans
which
they
gathered
in
the
fields
this
statement
is
all
the
more
remarkable
on
two
accounts
first
that
pease
and
beans
should
then
have
been
so
plentiful
as
to
afford
anything
like
sustenance
for
an
army
and
second
that
they
should
have
been
fit
for
use
so
early
in
the
season
even
allowing
for
the
difference
between
the
old
and
new
styles
in
the
reckoning
of
time
the
magnificent
old
abbeys
and
churches
of
scotland
in
early
times
also
indicate
that
at
some
remote
period
a
degree
of
civilization
and
prosperity
prevailed
from
which
the
country
had
gradually
fallen
the
ruins
of
the
ancient
edifices
of
melrose
kilwinning
aberborthwick
elgin
and
other
religious
establishments
show
that
architecture
must
then
have
made
great
progress
in
the
north
and
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
other
arts
had
reached
a
like
stage
of
advancement
this
is
borne
out
by
the
fact
of
the
number
of
and
bridges
of
olden
times
which
still
exist
in
different
parts
of
scotland
and
when
we
consider
says
professor
innes
the
long
and
united
efforts
required
in
the
early
state
of
the
arts
for
throwing
a
bridge
over
any
considerable
river
the
early
occurrence
of
bridges
may
well
be
admitted
as
one
of
the
best
tests
of
civilization
and
national
prosperity
as
in
england
so
in
scotland
the
reclamation
of
lands
the
improvement
of
agriculture
and
the
building
of
bridges
were
mainly
due
to
the
skill
and
industry
of
the
old
churchmen
when
their
ecclesiastical
organization
was
destroyed
the
country
speedily
relapsed
into
the
state
from
which
they
had
raised
it
and
scotland
continued
to
lie
in
ruins
almost
till
our
own
day
when
it
has
again
been
rescued
from
barrenness
more
effectually
even
than
before
by
the
combined
influences
of

to
meet
the
electors
there
in
little
more
than
four
and
twenty
hours
but
his
biographer
takes
care
to
relate
that
he
travelled
with
incredible
speed
glasgow
was
still
ten
days
distance
from
the
metropolis
and
the
arrival
of
the
mail
there
was
so
important
an
event
that
a
gun
was
fired
to
announce
its
coming
in
sheffield
set
up
a
flying
machine
on
steel
springs
to
london
in
it
slept
the
first
night
at
the
black
man
head
inn
nottingham
the
second
at
the
angel
northampton
and
arrived
at
the
swan
with
two
necks
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
the
fare
was
and
lbs
of
luggage
was
allowed
but
the
principal
part
of
the
expense
of
travelling
was
for
living
and
lodging
on
the
road
not
to
mention
the
fees
to
guards
and
drivers
though
the
dover
road
was
still
one
of
the
best
in
the
kingdom
the
dover
carrying
only
four
passengers
took
a
long
summer
day
to
perform
the
journey
it
set
out
from
dover
at
four
in
the
morning
breakfasted
at
the
red
lion
canterbury
and
the
passengers
ate
their
way
up
to
town
at
various
inns
on
the
road
arriving
in
london
in
time
for
supper
smollett
complained
of
the
innkeepers
along
that
route
as
the
greatest
set
of
extortioners
in
england
the
deliberate
style
in
which
journeys
were
performed
may
be
inferred
from
the
circumstance
that
on
one
occasion
when
a
quarrel
took
place
between
the
guard
and
a
passenger
the
coach
stopped
to
see
them
fight
it
out
on
the
road
foreigners
who
visited
england
were
peculiarly
observant
of
the
defective
modes
of
conveyance
then
in
use
thus
one
don
manoel
gonzales
a
portuguese
merchant
who
travelled
through
great
britain
in
speaking
of
yarmouth
says
they
have
a
comical
way
of
carrying
people
all
over
the
town
and
from
the
seaside
for
six
pence
they
call
it
their
coach
but
it
is
only
a
drawn
by
one
horse
without
any
covering
another
foreigner
herr
alberti
a
hanoverian
professor
of
theology
when
on
a
visit
to
oxford
in
desiring
to
proceed
to
cambridge
found
there
was
no
means
of
doing
so
without
returning
to
london
and
there
taking
coach
for
cambridge
there
was
not
even
the
convenience
of
a
carrier
waggon
between
the
two
universities
but
the
most
amusing
account
of
an
actual
journey
by
that
we
know
of
is
that
given
by
a
prussian
clergyman
charles
moritz
who
thus
describes
his
adventures
on
the
road
between
leicester
and
london
in
being
obliged
he
says
to
bestir
myself
to
get
back
to
london
as
the
time
drew
near
when
the
hamburgh
captain
with
whom
i
intended
to
return
had
fixed
his
departure
i
determined
to
take
a
place
as
far
as
northampton
on
the
outside
but
this
ride
from
leicester
to
northampton
i
shall
remember
as
long
as
i
live
the
coach
drove
from
the
yard
through
a
part
of
the
house
the
inside
passengers
got
in
from
the
yard
but
we
on
the
outside
were
obliged
to
clamber
up
in
the
street
because
we
should
have
had
no
room
for
our
heads
to
pass
under
the
gateway
my
companions
on
the
top
of
the
coach
were
a
farmer
a
young
man
very
decently
dressed
and
a
the
getting
up
alone
was
at
the
risk
of
one
life
and
when
i
was
up
i
was
obliged
to
sit
just
at
the
corner
of
the
coach
with
nothing
to
hold
by
but
a
sort
of
little
handle
fastened
on
the
side
i
sat
nearest
the
wheel
and
the
moment
that
we
set
off
i
fancied
that
i
saw
certain
death
before
me
all
i
could
do
was
to
take
still
tighter
hold
of
the
handle
and
to
be
strictly
careful
to
preserve
my
balance
the
machine
rolled
along
with
prodigious
rapidity
over
the
stones
through
the
town
and
every
moment
we
seemed
to
fly
into
the
air
so
much
so
that
it
appeared
to
me
a
complete
miracle
that
we
stuck
to
the
coach
at
all
but
we
were
completely
on
the
wing
as
often
as
we
passed
through
a
village
or
went
down
a
hill
this
continual
fear
of
death
at
last
became
insupportable
to
me
and
therefore
no
sooner
were
we
crawling
up
a
rather
steep
hill
and
consequently
proceeding
slower
than
usual
then
i
carefully
crept
from
the
top
of
the
coach
and
was
lucky
enough
to
get
myself
snugly
ensconced
in
the
basket
behind
sir
you
will
be
shaken
to
death
said
the
but
i
heeded
him
not
trusting
that
he
was
exaggerating
the
unpleasantness
of
my
new
situation
and
truly
as
long
as
we
went
on
slowly
up
the
hill
it
was
easy
and
pleasant
enough
and
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
falling
asleep
among
the
surrounding
trunks
and
packages
having
had
no
rest
the
night
before
when
on
a
sudden
the
coach
proceeded
at
a
rapid
rate
down
the
hill
then
all
the
boxes
and
began
as
it
were
to
dance
around
me
everything
in
the
basket
appeared
to
be
alive
and
every
moment
i
received
such
violent
blows
that
i
thought
my
last
hour
had
come
the
had
been
right
i
now
saw
clearly
but
repentance
was
useless
and
i
was
obliged
to
suffer
horrible
torture
for
nearly
an
hour
which
seemed
to
me
an
eternity
at
last
we
came
to
another
hill
when
quite
shaken
to
pieces
bleeding
and
sore
i
ruefully
crept
back
to
the
top
of
the
coach
to
my
former
seat
did
i
not
tell
you
that
you
would
be
shaken
to
death
inquired
the
black
man
when
i
was
creeping
along
on
my
stomach
but
i
gave
him
no
reply
indeed
i
was
ashamed
and
i
now
write
this
as
a
warning
to
all
strangers
who
are
inclined
to
ride
in
english
and
take
an
outside
at
or
worse
still
horror
of
horrors
a
seat
in
the
basket
from
harborough
to
northampton
i
had
a
most
dreadful
journey
it
rained
incessantly
and
as
before
we
had
been
covered
with
dust
so
now
we
were
soaked
with
rain
my
neighbour
the
young
man
who
sat
next
me
in
the
middle
every
now
and
then
fell
asleep
and
when
in
this
state
he
perpetually
bolted
and
rolled
against
me
with
the
whole
weight
of
his
body
more
than
once
nearly
pushing
me
from
my
seat
to
which
i
clung
with
the
last
strength
of
despair
my
forces
were
nearly
giving
way
when
at
last
happily
we
reached
northampton
on
the
evening
of
the
july
an
day
to
me
on
the
next
morning
i
took
an
inside
place
for
london
we
started
early
in
the
morning
the
journey
from
northampton
to
the
metropolis
however
i
can
scarcely
call
a
ride
for
it
was
a
perpetual
motion
or
endless
jolt
from
one
place
to
another
in
a
close
wooden
box
over
what
appeared
to
be
a
heap
of
unhewn
stones
and
trunks
of
trees
scattered
by
a
hurricane
to
make
my
happiness
complete
i
had
three
travelling
companions
all
farmers
who
slept
so
soundly
that
even
the
hearty
knocks
with
which
they
hammered
their
heads
against
each
other
and
against
mine
did
not
awake
them
their
faces
bloated
and
discoloured
by
ale
and
brandy
and
the
knocks
aforesaid
looked
as
they
lay
before
me
like
so
many
lumps
of
dead
flesh
i
looked
and
certainly
felt
like
a
crazy
fool
when
we
arrived
at
london
in
the
afternoon
image
the
basket
coach
arthur
young
in
his
books
inveighs
strongly
against
the
execrable
state
of
the
roads
in
all
parts
of
england
towards
the
end
of
last
century
in
essex
he
found
the
ruts
of
an
incredible
depth
and
he
almost
swore
at
one
near
tilbury
of
all
the
cursed
roads
he
says
that
ever
disgraced
this
kingdom
in
the
very
ages
of
barbarism
none
ever
equalled
that
from
billericay
to
the
head
at
tilbury
it
is
for
near
twelve
miles
so
narrow
that
a
mouse
can
not
pass
by
any
carriage
i
saw
a
fellow
creep
under
his
waggon
to
assist
me
to
lift
if
possible
my
chaise
over
a
hedge
to
add
to
all
the
infamous
circumstances
which
concur
to
plague
a
traveller
i
must
not
forget
the
eternally
meeting
with
chalk
waggons
themselves
frequently
stuck
fast
till
a
collection
of
them
are
in
the
same
situation
and
twenty
or
thirty
horses
may
be
tacked
to
each
to
draw
them
out
one
by
one
yet
will
it
be
believed
the
proposal
to
form
a
from
chelmsford
to
tilbury
was
resisted
by
the
bruins
of
the
country
whose
horses
were
worried
to
death
with
bringing
chalk
through
those
vile
roads
arthur
young
did
not
find
the
turnpike
any
better
between
bury
and
sudbury
in
suffolk
i
was
forced
to
move
as
slow
in
it
he
says
as
in
any
unmended
lane
in
wales
for
ponds
of
liquid
dirt
and
a
scattering
of
loose
flints
just
sufficient
to
lame
every
horse
that
moves
near
them
with
the
addition
of
cutting
vile
grips
across
the
road
under
the
pretence
of
letting
the
water
off
but
without
effect
altogether
render
at
least
twelve
out
of
these
sixteen
miles
as
infamous
a
turnpike
as
ever
was
beheld
between
tetsworth
and
oxford
he
found
the
turnpike
abounding
in
loose
stones
as
large
as
one
head
full
of
holes
deep
ruts
and
withal
so
narrow
that
with
great
difficulty
he
got
his
chaise
out
of
the
way
of
the
witney
waggons
barbarous
and
execrable
are
the
words
which
he
constantly
employs
in
speaking
of
the
roads
parish
and
turnpike
all
seemed
to
be
alike
bad
from
gloucester
to
newnham
a
distance
of
twelve
miles
he
found
a
cursed
road
infamously
stony
with
ruts
all
the
way
from
newnham
to
chepstow
he
noted
another
bad
feature
in
the
roads
and
that
was
the
perpetual
hills
for
he
says
you
will
form
a
clear
idea
of
them
if
you
suppose
the
country
to
represent
the
roofs
of
houses
joined
and
the
road
to
run
across
them
it
was
at
one
time
even
matter
of
grave
dispute
whether
it
would
not
cost
as
little
money
to
make
that
between
leominster
and
kington
navigable
as
to
make
it
hard
passing
still
further
west
the
unfortunate
traveller
who
seems
scarcely
able
to
find
words
to
express
his
sufferings
continues
but
my
dear
sir
what
am
i
to
say
of
the
roads
in
this
country
the
turnpikes
as
they
have
the
assurance
to
call
them
and
the
hardiness
to
make
one
pay
for
from
chepstow
to
the
house
between
newport
and
cardiff
they
continue
mere
rocky
lanes
full
of
hugeous
stones
as
big
as
one
horse
and
abominable
holes
the
first
six
miles
from
newport
they
were
so
detestable
and
without
either
or
milestones
that
i
could
not
well
persuade
myself
i
was
on
the
turnpike
but
had
mistook
the
road
and
therefore
asked
every
one
i
met
who
answered
me
to
my
astonishment
whatever
business
carries
you
into
this
country
avoid
it
at
least
till
they
have
good
roads
if
they
were
good
travelling
would
be
very
pleasant
at
a
subsequent
period
arthur
young
visited
the
northern
counties
but
his
account
of
the
roads
in
that
quarter
is
not
more
satisfactory
between
richmond
and
darlington
he
found
them
like
to
dislocate
his
bones
being
broken
in
many
places
into
deep
holes
and
almost
impassable
yet
says
he
the
people
will
drink
tea
a
decoction
against
the
use
of
which
the
traveller
is
found
constantly
declaiming
the
roads
in
lancashire
made
him
almost
frantic
and
he
gasped
for
words
to
express
his
rage
of
the
road
between
proud
preston
and
wigan
he
says
i
know
not
in
the
whole
range
of
language
terms
sufficiently
expressive
to
describe
this
infernal
road
let
me
most
seriously
caution
all
travellers
who
may
accidentally
propose
to
travel
this
terrible
country
to
avoid
it
as
they
would
the
devil
for
a
thousand
to
one
they
break
their
necks
or
their
limbs
by
overthrows
or
they
will
here
meet
with
ruts
which
i
actually
measured
four
feet
deep
and
floating
with
mud
only
from
a
wet
summer
what
therefore
must
it
be
after
a
winter
the
only
mending
it
receives
is
tumbling
in
some
loose
stones
which
serve
no
other
purpose
than
jolting
a
carriage
in
the
most
intolerable
manner
these
are
not
merely
opinions
but
facts
for
i
actually
passed
three
carts
broken
down
in
those
eighteen
miles
of
execrable
memory
it
would
even
appear
that
the
bad
state
of
the
roads
in
the
midland
counties
about
the
same
time
had
nearly
caused
the
death
of
the
heir
to
the
throne
on
the
of
september
the
prince
of
wales
left
wentworth
hall
where
he
had
been
on
a
visit
to
earl
fitzwilliam
and
took
the
road
for
london
in
his
carriage
when
about
two
miles
from
newark
the
prince
coach
was
overturned
by
a
cart
in
a
narrow
part
of
the
road
it
rolled
down
a
slope
turning
over
three
times
and
landed
at
the
bottom
shivered
to
pieces
fortunately
the
prince
escaped
with
only
a
few
bruises
and
a
sprain
but
the
incident
had
no
effect
in
stirring
up
the
local
authorities
to
make
any
improvement
in
the
road
which
remained
in
the
same
wretched
state
until
a
comparatively
recent
period
when
palmer
new
were
introduced
an
attempt
was
made
to
diminish
the
jolting
of
the
passengers
by
having
the
carriages
hung
upon
new
patent
springs
but
with
very
indifferent
results
mathew
boulton
the
engineer
thus
described
their
effect
upon
himself
in
a
journey
he
made
in
one
of
them
from
london
into
devonshire
in
i
had
the
most
disagreeable
journey
i
ever
experienced
the
night
after
i
left
you
owing
to
the
new
improved
patent
coach
a
vehicle
loaded
with
iron
trappings
and
the
greatest
complication
of
unmechanical
contrivances
jumbled
together
that
i
have
ever
witnessed
the
coach
swings
sideways
with
a
sickly
sway
without
any
vertical
spring
the
point
of
suspense
bearing
upon
an
arch
called
a
spring
though
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
the
severity
of
the
jolting
occasioned
me
such
disorder
that
i
was
obliged
to
stop
at
axminster
and
go
to
bed
very
ill
however
i
was
able
next
day
to
proceed
in
a
the
landlady
in
the
london
inn
at
exeter
assured
me
that
the
passengers
who
arrived
every
night
were
in
general
so
ill
that
they
were
obliged
to
go
supperless
to
bed
and
unless
they
go
back
to
the
coach
hung
a
little
lower
the
will
lose
all
their
custom
we
may
briefly
refer
to
the
several
stages
of
improvement
if
improvement
it
could
be
called
in
the
most
frequented
highways
of
the
kingdom
and
to
the
action
of
the
legislature
with
reference
to
the
extension
of
turnpikes
the
trade
and
industry
of
the
country
had
been
steadily
improving
but
the
greatest
obstacle
to
their
further
progress
was
always
felt
to
be
the
disgraceful
state
of
the
roads
as
long
ago
as
the
year
an
act
was
authorising
the
first
or
turnpikes
to
be
erected
at
which
collectors
were
stationed
to
levy
small
sums
from
those
using
the
road
for
the
purpose
of
defraying
the
needful
expenses
of
their
maintenance
this
act
however
only
applied
to
a
portion
of
the
great
north
road
between
london
and
york
and
it
authorised
the
new
to
be
erected
at
wade
mill
in
hertfordshire
at
caxton
in
cambridgeshire
and
at
stilton
in
huntingdonshire
the
act
was
not
followed
by
any
others
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
even
after
that
lapse
of
time
such
acts
as
were
passed
of
a
similar
character
were
very
few
and
far
between
for
nearly
a
century
more
travellers
from
edinburgh
to
london
met
with
no
turnpikes
until
within
about
miles
of
the
metropolis
north
of
that
point
there
was
only
a
narrow
causeway
fit
for
flanked
with
clay
sloughs
on
either
side
it
is
however
stated
that
the
duke
of
cumberland
and
the
earl
of
albemarle
when
on
their
way
to
scotland
in
pursuit
of
the
rebels
in
did
contrive
to
reach
durham
in
a
coach
and
six
but
there
the
roads
were
found
so
wretched
that
they
were
under
the
necessity
of
taking
to
horse
and
george
bowes
the
county
member
made
his
royal
highness
a
present
of
his
nag
to
enable
him
to
proceed
on
his
journey
the
roads
west
of
newcastle
were
so
bad
that
in
the
previous
year
the
royal
forces
under
general
wade
which
left
newcastle
for
carlisle
to
intercept
the
pretender
and
his
army
halted
the
first
night
at
ovingham
and
the
second
at
hexham
being
able
to
travel
only
twenty
miles
in
two
days
the
rebellion
of
gave
a
great
impulse
to
the
construction
of
roads
for
military
as
well
as
civil
purposes
the
nimble
highlanders
without
baggage
or
waggons
had
been
able
to
cross
the
border
and
penetrate
almost
to
the
centre
of
england
before
any
definite
knowledge
of
their
proceedings
had
reached
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
in
the
metropolis
itself
little
information
could
be
obtained
of
the
movements
of
the
rebel
army
for
several
days
after
they
had
left
edinburgh
light
of
foot
they
outstripped
the
cavalry
and
artillery
of
the
royal
army
which
were
delayed
at
all
points
by
impassable
roads
no
sooner
however
was
the
rebellion
put
down
than
government
directed
its
attention
to
the
best
means
of
securing
the
permanent
subordination
of
the
highlands
and
with
this
object
the
construction
of
good
highways
was
declared
to
be
indispensable
the
expediency
of
opening
up
the
communication
between
the
capital
and
the
principal
towns
of
scotland
was
also
generally
admitted
and
from
that
time
though
slowly
the
construction
of
the
main
high
routes
between
north
and
south
made
steady
progress
the
extension
of
the
turnpike
system
however
encountered
violent
opposition
from
the
people
being
regarded
as
a
grievous
tax
upon
their
freedom
of
movement
from
place
to
place
armed
bodies
of
men
assembled
to
destroy
the
turnpikes
and
they
burnt
down
the
and
blew
up
the
posts
with
gunpowder
the
resistance
was
the
greatest
in
yorkshire
along
the
line
of
the
great
north
road
towards
scotland
though
riots
also
took
place
in
somersetshire
and
gloucestershire
and
even
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
london
one
fine
may
morning
at
selby
in
yorkshire
the
public
bellman
summoned
the
inhabitants
to
assemble
with
their
hatchets
and
axes
that
night
at
midnight
and
cut
down
the
turnpikes
erected
by
act
of
parliament
nor
were
they
slow
to
act
upon
his
summons
soldiers
were
then
sent
into
the
district
to
protect
the
and
the
but
this
was
a
difficult
matter
for
the
were
numerous
and
wherever
a
pike
was
left
unprotected
at
night
it
was
found
destroyed
in
the
morning
the
yeadon
and
otley
mobs
near
leeds
were
especially
violent
on
the
of
june
they
made
quite
a
raid
upon
the
turnpikes
burning
or
destroying
about
a
dozen
in
one
week
a
score
of
the
rioters
were
apprehended
and
while
on
their
way
to
york
castle
a
rescue
was
attempted
when
the
soldiers
were
under
the
necessity
of
firing
and
many
persons
were
killed
and
wounded
the
prejudices
entertained
against
the
turnpikes
were
so
strong
that
in
some
places
the
country
people
would
not
even
use
the
improved
roads
after
they
were
made
for
instance
the
driver
of
the
marlborough
coach
obstinately
refused
to
use
the
new
bath
road
but
stuck
to
the
old
called
ramsbury
he
was
an
old
man
he
said
his
grandfather
and
father
had
driven
the
aforesaid
way
before
him
and
he
would
continue
in
the
old
track
till
death
petitions
were
also
presented
to
parliament
against
the
extension
of
turnpikes
but
the
opposition
represented
by
the
petitioners
was
of
a
much
less
honest
character
than
that
of
the
misguided
and
prejudiced
country
folks
who
burnt
down
the
it
was
principally
got
up
by
the
agriculturists
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
who
having
secured
the
advantages
which
the
first
constructed
had
conferred
upon
them
desired
to
retain
a
monopoly
of
the
improved
means
of
communication
they
alleged
that
if
were
extended
into
the
remoter
counties
the
greater
cheapness
of
labour
there
would
enable
the
distant
farmers
to
sell
their
grass
and
corn
cheaper
in
the
london
market
than
themselves
and
that
thus
they
would
be
ruined
this
opposition
however
did
not
prevent
the
progress
of
turnpike
and
highway
legislation
and
we
find
that
from
to
no
fewer
than
four
hundred
and
acts
were
passed
for
making
and
repairing
highways
nevertheless
the
roads
of
the
kingdom
long
continued
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
state
chiefly
arising
from
the
extremely
imperfect
manner
in
which
they
were
made
as
a
profession
was
as
yet
unknown
deviations
were
made
in
the
old
roads
to
make
them
more
easy
and
straight
but
the
deep
ruts
were
merely
filled
up
with
any
materials
that
lay
nearest
at
hand
and
stones
taken
from
the
quarry
instead
of
being
broken
and
laid
on
carefully
to
a
proper
depth
were
tumbled
down
and
roughly
spread
the
country
trusting
to
the
operation
of
and
waggons
to
crush
them
into
a
proper
shape
men
of
eminence
as
engineers
and
there
were
very
few
such
at
the
time
considered
beneath
their
consideration
and
it
was
even
thought
singular
that
in
the
distinguished
smeaton
should
have
condescended
to
make
a
road
across
the
valley
of
the
trent
between
markham
and
newark
the
making
of
the
new
roads
was
thus
left
to
such
persons
as
might
choose
to
take
up
the
trade
special
skill
not
being
thought
at
all
necessary
on
the
part
of
a
it
is
only
in
this
way
that
we
can
account
for
the
remarkable
fact
that
the
first
extensive
maker
of
roads
who
pursued
it
as
a
business
was
not
an
engineer
nor
even
a
mechanic
but
a
blind
man
bred
to
no
trade
and
possessing
no
experience
whatever
in
the
arts
of
surveying
or
yet
a
man
possessed
of
extraordinary
natural
gifts

unquestionably
most
successful

metcalf
birthplace
knaresborough
john
metcalf
was
born
at
knaresborough
in
the
son
of
poor
working
people
when
only
six
years
old
he
was
seized
with
virulent
which
totally
destroyed
his
sight
the
blind
boy
when
sufficiently
recovered
to
go
abroad
first
learnt
to
grope
from
door
to
door
along
the
walls
on
either
side
of
his
parents
dwelling
in
about
six
months
he
was
able
to
feel
his
way
to
the
end
of
the
street
and
back
without
a
guide
and
in
three
years
he
could
go
on
a
message
to
any
part
of
the
town
he
grew
strong
and
healthy
and
longed
to
join
in
the
sports
of
boys
of
his
age
he
went
with
them
and
climbed
the
trees
while
the
boys
below
directed
him
to
the
nests
receiving
his
share
of
eggs
and
young
birds
thus
he
shortly
became
an
expert
climber
and
could
mount
with
ease
any
tree
that
he
was
able
to
grasp
he
rambled
into
the
lanes
and
fields
alone
and
soon
knew
every
foot
of
the
ground
for
miles
round
knaresborough
he
next
learnt
to
ride
delighting
above
all
things
in
a
gallop
he
contrived
to
keep
a
dog
and
coursed
hares
indeed
the
boy
was
the
marvel
of
the
neighbourhood
his
unrestrainable
activity
his
acuteness
of
sense
his
shrewdness
and
his
cleverness
astonished
everybody
the
boy
confidence
in
himself
was
such
that
though
blind
he
was
ready
to
undertake
almost
any
adventure
among
his
other
arts
he
learned
to
swim
in
the
nidd
and
became
so
expert
that
on
one
occasion
he
saved
the
lives
of
three
of
his
companions
once
when
two
men
were
drowned
in
a
deep
part
of
the
river
metcalf
was
sent
for
to
dive
for
them
which
he
did
and
brought
up
one
of
the
bodies
at
the
fourth
diving
the
other
had
been
carried
down
the
stream
he
thus
also
saved
a
manufacturer
yarn
a
large
quantity
of
which
had
been
carried
by
a
sudden
flood
into
a
deep
hole
under
the
high
bridge
at
home
in
the
evenings
he
learnt
to
play
the
fiddle
and
became
so
skilled
on
the
instrument
that
he
was
shortly
able
to
earn
money
by
playing
dance
music
at
country
parties
at
christmas
time
he
played
waits
and
during
the
harrogate
season
he
played
to
the
assemblies
at
the
queen
head
and
the
green
dragon
on
one
occasion
towards
dusk
he
acted
as
guide
to
a
belated
gentleman
along
the
difficult
road
from
york
to
harrogate
the
road
was
then
full
of
windings
and
turnings
and
in
many
places
it
was
no
better
than
a
track
across
unenclosed
moors
metcalf
brought
the
gentleman
safe
to
his
inn
the
granby
late
at
night
and
was
invited
to
join
in
a
tankard
of
negus
on
metcalf
leaving
the
room
the
gentleman
observed
to
the
landlord
i
think
landlord
my
guide
must
have
drunk
a
great
deal
of
spirits
since
we
came
here
why
so
sir
well
i
judge
so
from
the
appearance
of
his
eyes
eyes
bless
you
sir
rejoined
the
landlord
yon
know
that
he
is
blind
blind
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
sir
that
he
can
not
see
he
is
as
blind
as
a
stone
well
landlord
said
the
gentleman
this
is
really
too
much
call
him
in
enter
metcalf
my
friend
are
you
really
blind
yes
sir
said
he
i
lost
my
sight
when
six
years
old
had
i
known
that
i
would
not
have
ventured
with
you
on
that
road
from
york
for
a
hundred
pounds
and
i
sir
said
metcalf
would
not
have
lost
my
way
for
a
thousand
metcalf
having
thriven
and
saved
money
bought
and
rode
a
horse
of
his
own
he
had
a
great
affection
for
the
animal
and
when
he
called
it
would
immediately
answer
him
by
neighing
the
most
surprising
thing
is
that
he
was
a
good
huntsman
and
to
follow
the
hounds
was
one
of
his
greatest
pleasures
he
was
as
bold
as
a
rider
as
ever
took
the
field
he
trusted
much
no
doubt
to
the
sagacity
of
his
horse
but
he
himself
was
apparently
regardless
of
danger
the
hunting
adventures
which
are
related
of
him
considering
his
blindness
seem
altogether
marvellous
he
would
also
run
his
horse
for
the
petty
prizes
or
plates
given
at
the
feasts
in
the
neighbourhood
and
he
attended
the
races
at
york
and
other
places
where
he
made
bets
with
considerable
skill
keeping
well
in
his
memory
the
winning
and
losing
horses
after
the
races
he
would
return
to
knaresborough
late
at
night
guiding
others
who
but
for
him
could
never
have
made
out
the
way
on
one
occasion
he
rode
his
horse
in
a
match
in
knaresborough
forest
the
ground
was
marked
out
by
posts
including
a
circle
of
a
mile
and
the
race
was
three
times
round
great
odds
were
laid
against
the
blind
man
because
of
his
supposed
inability
to
keep
the
course
but
his
ingenuity
was
never
at
fault
he
procured
a
number
of
from
the
harrogate
inns
and
set
men
to
ring
them
at
the
several
posts
their
sound
was
enough
to
direct
him
during
the
race
and
the
blind
man
came
in
the
winner
after
the
race
was
over
a
gentleman
who
owned
a
notorious
runaway
horse
came
up
and
offered
to
lay
a
bet
with
metcalf
that
he
could
not
gallop
the
horse
fifty
yards
and
stop
it
within
two
hundred
metcalf
accepted
the
bet
with
the
condition
that
he
might
choose
his
ground
this
was
agreed
to
but
there
was
to
be
neither
hedge
nor
wall
in
the
distance
metcalf
forthwith
proceeded
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
large
bog
near
the
harrogate
old
spa
and
having
placed
a
person
on
the
line
in
which
he
proposed
to
ride
who
was
to
sing
a
song
to
guide
him
by
its
sound
he
mounted
and
rode
straight
into
the
bog
where
he
had
the
horse
effectually
stopped
within
the
stipulated
two
hundred
yards
stuck
up
to
his
in
the
mire
metcalf
scrambled
out
and
claimed
his
wager
but
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
the
horse
could
be
extricated
the
blind
man
also
played
at
bowls
very
successfully
receiving
the
odds
of
a
bowl
extra
for
the
deficiency
of
each
eye
he
had
thus
three
bowls
for
the
other
one
and
he
took
care
to
place
one
friend
at
the
jack
and
another
midway
who
keeping
up
a
constant
discourse
with
him
enabled
him
readily
to
judge
of
the
distance
in
athletic
sports
such
as
wrestling
and
boxing
he
was
also
a
great
adept
and
being
now
a
man
of
great
strength
and
robustness
about
six
feet
two
in
height
few
durst
try
upon
him
the
practical
jokes
which
cowardly
persons
are
sometimes
disposed
to
play
upon
the
blind
notwithstanding
his
mischievous
tricks
and
youthful
wildness
there
must
have
been
something
exceedingly
winning
about
the
man
possessed
as
he
was
of
a
strong
manly
and
affectionate
nature
and
we
are
not
therefore
surprised
to
learn
that
the
land
daughter
of
the
granby
fairly
fell
in
love
with
blind
jack
and
married
him
much
to
the
disgust
of
her
relatives
when
asked
how
it
was
that
she
could
marry
such
a
man
her
reply
was
because
i
could
not
be
happy
without
him
his
actions
are
so
singular
and
his
spirit
so
manly
and
enterprising
that
i
could
not
help
loving
him
but
after
all
dolly
was
not
so
far
wrong
in
the
choice
as
her
parents
thought
her
as
the
result
proved
metcalf
had
in
him
elements
of
success
in
life
which
even
according
to
the
world
estimate
made
him
eventually
a
very
good
match
and
the
woman
clear
sight
in
this
case
stood
her
in
good
stead
but
before
this
marriage
was
consummated
metcalf
had
wandered
far
and
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
world
as
he
termed
it
he
travelled
on
horseback
to
whitby
and
from
thence
he
sailed
for
london
taking
with
him
his
fiddle
by
the
aid
of
which
he
continued
to
earn
enough
to
maintain
himself
for
several
weeks
in
the
metropolis
returning
to
whitby
he
sailed
from
thence
to
newcastle
to
see
some
friends
there
whom
he
had
known
at
harrogate
while
visiting
that
he
was
welcomed
by
many
families
and
spent
an
agreeable
month
afterwards
visiting
sunderland
still
supporting
himself
by
his
violin
playing
then
he
returned
to
whitby
for
his
horse
and
rode
homeward
alone
to
knaresborough
by
pickering
malton
and
york
over
very
bad
roads
the
greater
part
of
which
he
had
never
travelled
before
yet
without
once
missing
his
way
when
he
arrived
at
york
it
was
the
dead
of
night
and
he
found
the
city
gates
at
middlethorp
shut
they
were
of
strong
planks
with
iron
spikes
fixed
on
the
top
but
throwing
his
horse
over
one
of
the
spikes
he
climbed
up
and
by
the
help
of
a
corner
of
the
wall
that
joined
the
gates
he
got
safely
over
then
opening
them
from
the
inside
he
led
his
horse
through
after
another
season
at
harrogate
he
made
a
second
visit
to
london
in
the
company
of
a
north
countryman
who
played
the
small
pipes
he
was
kindly
entertained
by
colonel
liddell
of
ravensworth
castle
who
gave
him
a
general
invitation
to
his
house
during
this
visit
which
was
in
metcalf
ranged
freely
over
the
metropolis
visiting
maidenhead
and
reading
and
returning
by
windsor
and
hampton
court
the
harrogate
season
being
at
hand
he
prepared
to
proceed
thither
colonel
liddell
who
was
also
about
setting
out
for
harrogate
offering
him
a
seat
behind
his
coach
metcalf
thanked
him
but
declined
the
offer
observing
that
he
could
with
great
ease
walk
as
far
in
a
day
as
he
the
colonel
was
likely
to
travel
in
his
carriage
besides
he
preferred
the
walking
that
a
blind
man
should
undertake
to
walk
a
distance
of
two
hundred
miles
over
an
unknown
road
in
the
same
time
that
it
took
a
gentleman
to
perform
the
same
distance
in
his
coach
dragged
by
seems
almost
incredible
yet
metcalf
actually
arrived
at
harrogate
before
the
colonel
and
that
without
hurrying
by
the
way
the
circumstance
is
easily
accounted
for
by
the
deplorable
state
of
the
roads
which
made
travelling
by
foot
on
the
whole
considerably
more
expeditious
than
travelling
by
coach
the
story
is
even
extant
of
a
man
with
a
wooden
leg
being
once
offered
a
lift
upon
a
but
he
declined
with
i
wait
i
in
a
hurry
and
he
stumped
on
ahead
of
the
coach
the
account
of
metcalf
journey
on
foot
from
london
to
harrogate
is
not
without
a
special
bearing
on
our
subject
as
illustrative
of
the
state
of
the
roads
at
the
time
he
started
on
a
monday
morning
about
an
hour
before
the
colonel
in
his
carriage
with
his
suite
which
consisted
of
sixteen
servants
on
horseback
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
sleep
that
night
at
welwyn
in
hertfordshire
metcalf
made
his
way
to
barnet
but
a
little
north
of
that
town
where
the
road
branches
off
to
albans
he
took
the
wrong
way
and
thus
made
a
considerable
detour
nevertheless
he
arrived
at
welwyn
first
to
the
surprise
of
the
colonel
next
morning
he
set
off
as
before
and
reached
biggleswade
but
there
he
found
the
river
swollen
and
no
bridge
provided
to
enable
travellers
to
cross
to
the
further
side
he
made
a
considerable
circuit
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
method
of
crossing
the
stream
and
was
so
fortunate
as
to
fall
in
with
a
fellow
wayfarer
who
led
the
way
across
some
planks
metcalf
following
the
sound
of
his
feet
arrived
at
the
other
side
metcalf
taking
some
pence
from
his
pocket
said
here
my
good
fellow
take
that
and
get
a
pint
of
beer
the
stranger
declined
saying
he
was
welcome
to
his
services
metcalf
however
pressed
upon
his
guide
the
small
reward
when
the
other
asked
pray
can
you
see
very
well
not
remarkably
well
said
metcalf
my
friend
said
the
stranger
i
do
not
mean
to
tithe
you
i
am
the
rector
of
this
parish
so
god
bless
you
and
i
wish
you
a
good
metcalf
set
forward
again
with
the
blessing
and
reached
his
journey
end
safely
again
before
the
colonel
on
the
saturday
after
their
setting
out
from
london
the
travellers
reached
wetherby
where
colonel
liddell
desired
to
rest
until
the
monday
but
metcalf
proceeded
on
to
harrogate
thus
completing
the
journey
in
six
days
the
colonel
arriving
two
days
later
he
now
renewed
his
musical
performances
at
harrogate
and
was
also
in
considerable
request
at
the
ripon
assemblies
which
were
attended
by
most
of
the
families
of
distinction
in
that
neighbourhood
when
the
season
at
harrogate
was
over
he
retired
to
knaresborough
with
his
young
wife
and
having
purchased
an
old
house
he
had
it
pulled
down
and
another
built
on
its
site
he
himself
getting
the
requisite
stones
for
the
masonry
out
of
the
bed
of
the
adjoining
river
the
uncertainty
of
the
income
derived
from
musical
performances
led
him
to
think
of
following
some
more
settled
pursuit
now
that
he
had
a
wife
to
maintain
as
well
as
himself
he
accordingly
set
up
a
and
a
chaise
for
the
public
accommodation
harrogate
up
to
that
time
being
without
any
vehicle
for
hire
the
innkeepers
of
the
town
having
followed
his
example
and
abstracted
most
of
his
business
metcalf
next
took
to
he
bought
fish
at
the
coast
which
he
conveyed
on
horseback
to
leeds
and
other
towns
for
sale
he
continued
indefatigable
at
this
trade
for
some
time
being
on
the
road
often
for
nights
together
but
he
was
at
length
forced
to
abandon
it
in
consequence
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
returns
he
was
therefore
under
the
necessity
of
again
taking
up
his
violin
and
he
was
employed
as
a
musician
in
the
long
room
at
harrogate
at
the
time
of
the
outbreak
of
the
rebellion
of
the
news
of
the
rout
of
the
royal
army
at
prestonpans
and
the
intended
march
of
the
highlanders
southwards
put
a
stop
to
business
as
well
as
pleasure
and
caused
a
general
consternation
throughout
the
northern
counties
the
great
bulk
of
the
people
were
however
comparatively
indifferent
to
the
measures
of
defence
which
were
adopted
and
but
for
the
energy
displayed
by
the
country
gentlemen
in
raising
forces
in
support
of
the
established
government
the
stuarts
might
again
have
been
seated
on
the
throne
of
britain
among
the
county
gentlemen
of
york
who
distinguished
themselves
on
the
occasion
was
william
thornton
of
thornville
royal
the
county
having
voted
ninety
thousand
pounds
for
raising
clothing
and
maintaining
a
body
of
four
thousand
men
thornton
proposed
at
a
public
meeting
held
at
york
that
they
should
be
embodied
with
the
regulars
and
march
with
the
forces
to
meet
the
pretender
in
the
field
this
proposal
was
however
overruled
the
majority
of
the
meeting
resolving
that
the
men
should
be
retained
at
home
for
purposes
merely
of
local
defence
on
this
decision
being
come
to
thornton
determined
to
raise
a
company
of
volunteers
at
his
own
expense
and
to
join
the
royal
army
with
such
force
as
he
could
muster
he
then
went
abroad
among
his
tenantry
and
servants
and
endeavoured
to
induce
them
to
follow
him
but
without
success
still
determined
on
raising
his
company
thornton
next
cast
about
him
for
other
means
and
who
should
he
think
of
in
his
emergency
but
blind
jack
metcalf
had
often
played
to
his
family
at
christmas
time
and
the
squire
knew
him
to
be
one
of
the
most
popular
men
in
the
neighbourhood
he
accordingly
proceeded
to
knaresborough
to
confer
with
metcalf
on
the
subject
it
was
then
about
the
beginning
of
october
only
a
fortnight
after
the
battle
of
prestonpans
sending
for
jack
to
his
inn
thornton
told
him
of
the
state
of
affairs
that
the
french
were
coming
to
join
the
rebels
and
that
if
the
country
were
allowed
to
fall
into
their
hands
no
man
wife
daughter
nor
sister
would
be
safe
loyalty
was
at
once
kindled
if
no
one
else
would
join
the
squire
he
would
thus
enlisted
perhaps
carried
away
by
his
love
of
adventure
not
less
than
by
his
feeling
of
patriotism
metcalf
proceeded
to
enlist
others
and
in
two
days
a
hundred
and
forty
men
were
obtained
from
whom
thornton
drafted
the
intended
number
of
his
company
the
men
were
immediately
drilled
and
brought
into
a
state
of
as
much
efficiency
as
was
practicable
in
the
time
and
when
they
marched
off
to
join
general
wade
army
at
boroughbridge
the
captain
said
to
them
on
setting
out
my
lads
you
are
going
to
form
part
of
a
to
the
finest
estate
in
the
world
blind
jack
played
a
march
at
the
head
of
the
company
dressed
in
blue
and
buff
and
in
a
hat
the
captain
said
he
would
willingly
give
a
hundred
guineas
for
only
one
eye
to
put
in
jack
head
he
was
such
a
useful
spirited
handy
fellow
on
arriving
at
newcastle
captain
thornton
company
was
united
to
pulteney
regiment
one
of
the
weakest
the
army
lay
for
a
week
in
tents
on
the
moor
winter
had
set
in
and
the
snow
lay
thick
on
the
ground
but
intelligence
arriving
that
prince
charles
with
his
highlanders
was
proceeding
southwards
by
way
of
carlisle
general
wade
gave
orders
for
the
immediate
advance
of
the
army
on
hexham
in
the
hope
of
intercepting
them
by
that
route
they
set
out
on
their
march
amidst
hail
and
snow
and
in
addition
to
the
obstruction
caused
by
the
weather
they
had
to
overcome
the
difficulties
occasioned
by
the
badness
of
the
roads
the
men
were
often
three
or
in
marching
a
mile
the
pioneers
having
to
fill
up
ditches
and
clear
away
many
obstructions
in
making
a
practicable
passage
for
the
artillery
and
baggage
the
army
was
only
able
to
reach
ovingham
a
distance
of
little
more
than
ten
miles
after
fifteen
hours
marching
the
night
was
bitter
cold
the
ground
was
frozen
so
hard
that
but
few
of
the
could
be
driven
and
the
men
lay
down
upon
the
earth
amongst
their
straw
metcalf
to
keep
up
the
spirits
of
his
company
for
sleep
was
next
to
impossible
took
out
his
fiddle
and
played
lively
tunes
whilst
the
men
danced
round
the
straw
which
they
set
on
fire
next
day
the
army
marched
for
hexham
but
the
rebels
having
already
passed
southward
general
wade
retraced
his
steps
to
newcastle
to
gain
the
high
road
leading
to
yorkshire
whither
he
marched
in
all
haste
and
for
a
time
his
army
lay
before
leeds
on
fields
now
covered
with
streets
some
of
which
still
bear
the
names
of
and
in
consequence
of
the
event
on
the
retreat
of
prince
charles
from
derby
general
wade
again
proceeded
to
newcastle
while
the
duke
of
cumberland
hung
upon
the
rear
of
the
rebels
along
their
line
of
retreat
by
penrith
and
carlisle
wade
army
proceeded
by
forced
marches
into
scotland
and
at
length
came
up
with
the
highlanders
at
falkirk
metcalf
continued
with
captain
thornton
and
his
company
throughout
all
these
marchings
and
countermarchings
determined
to
be
of
service
to
his
master
if
he
could
and
at
all
events
to
see
the
end
of
the
campaign
at
the
battle
of
falkirk
he
played
his
company
to
the
field
but
it
was
a
battle
on
the
part
of
the
royalist
general
and
the
result
was
a
total
defeat
twenty
of
thornton
men
were
made
prisoners
with
the
lieutenant
and
ensign
the
captain
himself
only
escaped
by
taking
refuge
in
a
poor
woman
house
in
the
town
of
falkirk
where
he
lay
hidden
for
many
days
metcalf
returning
to
edinburgh
with
the
rest
of
the
defeated
army
some
of
the
dragoon
officers
hearing
of
jack
escape
sent
for
him
to
at
holyrood
to
question
him
about
his
captain
one
of
them
took
occasion
to
speak
ironically
of
thornton
men
and
asked
metcalf
how
he
had
contrived
to
escape
oh
said
jack
i
found
it
easy
to
follow
the
sound
of
the
dragoons
horses
they
made
such
a
clatter
over
the
stones
when
flying
from
the
highlandmen
another
asked
him
how
he
a
blind
man
durst
venture
upon
such
a
service
to
which
metcalf
replied
that
had
he
possessed
a
pair
of
good
eyes
perhaps
he
would
not
have
come
there
to
risk
the
loss
of
them
by
gunpowder
no
more
questions
were
asked
and
jack
withdrew
but
he
was
not
satisfied
about
the
disappearance
of
captain
thornton
and
determined
on
going
back
to
falkirk
within
the
enemy
lines
to
get
news
of
him
and
perhaps
to
rescue
him
if
that
were
still
possible
the
rest
of
the
company
were
very
much
disheartened
at
the
loss
of
their
officers
and
so
many
of
their
comrades
and
wished
metcalf
to
furnish
them
with
the
means
of
returning
home
but
he
would
not
hear
of
such
a
thing
and
strongly
encouraged
them
to
remain
until
at
all
events
he
had
got
news
of
the
captain
he
then
set
out
for
prince
charles
camp
on
reaching
the
outposts
of
the
english
army
he
was
urged
by
the
officer
in
command
to
lay
aside
his
project
which
would
certainly
cost
him
his
life
but
metcalf
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
and
he
was
permitted
to
proceed
which
he
did
in
the
company
of
one
of
the
rebel
spies
pretending
that
he
wished
to
be
engaged
as
a
musician
in
the
prince
army
a
woman
whom
they
met
returning
to
edinburgh
from
the
field
of
falkirk
laden
with
plunder
gave
metcalf
a
token
to
her
husband
who
was
lord
george
murray
cook
and
this
secured
him
an
access
to
the
prince
quarters
but
notwithstanding
a
most
diligent
search
he
could
hear
nothing
of
his
master
unfortunately
for
him
a
person
who
had
seen
him
at
harrogate
pointed
him
out
as
a
suspicions
character
and
he
was
seized
and
put
in
confinement
for
three
days
after
which
he
was
tried
by
court
martial
but
as
nothing
could
be
alleged
against
him
he
was
acquitted
and
shortly
after
made
his
escape
from
the
rebel
camp
on
reaching
edinburgh
very
much
to
his
delight
he
found
captain
thornton
had
arrived
there
before
him
on
the
of
january
the
duke
of
cumberland
reached
edinburgh
and
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
royal
army
which
proceeded
northward
in
pursuit
of
the
highlanders
at
aberdeen
where
the
duke
gave
a
ball
metcalf
was
found
to
be
the
only
musician
in
camp
who
could
play
country
dances
and
he
played
to
the
company
standing
on
a
chair
for
eight
hours
the
duke
several
times
as
he
passed
him
shouting
out
thornton
play
up
next
morning
the
duke
sent
him
a
present
of
two
guineas
but
as
the
captain
would
not
allow
him
to
receive
such
gifts
while
in
his
pay
metcalf
spent
the
money
with
his
permission
in
giving
a
treat
to
the
duke
two
body
servants
the
battle
of
culloden
so
disastrous
to
the
poor
highlanders
shortly
followed
after
which
captain
thornton
metcalf
and
the
yorkshire
volunteer
company
proceeded
homewards
metcalf
young
wife
had
been
in
great
fears
for
the
safety
of
her
blind
fearless
and
almost
reckless
partner
but
she
received
him
with
open
arms
and
his
spirit
of
adventure
being
now
considerably
allayed
he
determined
to
settle
quietly
down
to
the
steady
pursuit
of
business
during
his
stay
in
aberdeen
metcalf
had
made
himself
familiar
with
the
articles
of
clothing
manufactured
at
that
place
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
profitable
trade
might
be
carried
on
by
buying
them
on
the
spot
and
selling
them
by
retail
to
customers
in
yorkshire
he
accordingly
proceeded
to
aberdeen
in
the
following
spring
and
bought
a
considerable
stock
of
cotton
and
worsted
stockings
which
he
found
he
could
readily
dispose
of
on
his
return
home
his
knowledge
of
horseflesh
in
which
he
was
of
course
mainly
guided
by
his
acute
sense
of
feeling
also
proved
highly
serviceable
to
him
and
he
bought
considerable
numbers
of
horses
in
yorkshire
for
sale
in
scotland
bringing
back
galloways
in
return
it
is
supposed
that
at
the
same
time
he
carried
on
a
profitable
contraband
trade
in
tea
and
such
like
articles
after
this
metcalf
began
a
new
line
of
business
that
of
common
carrier
between
york
and
knaresborough
plying
the
first
on
that
road
he
made
the
journey
twice
a
week
in
summer
and
once
a
week
in
winter
he
also
undertook
the
conveyance
of
army
baggage
most
other
owners
of
carts
at
that
time
being
afraid
of
soldiers
regarding
them
as
a
wild
rough
set
with
whom
it
was
dangerous
to
have
any
dealings
but
the
blind
man
knew
them
better
and
while
he
drove
a
profitable
trade
in
carrying
their
baggage
from
town
to
town
they
never
did
him
any
harm
by
these
means
he
very
shortly
succeeded
in
realising
a
considerable
store
of
savings
besides
being
able
to
maintain
his
family
in
respectability
and
comfort
metcalf
however
had
not
yet
entered
upon
the
main
business
of
his
life
the
reader
will
already
have
observed
how
strong
of
heart
and
resolute
of
purpose
he
was
during
his
adventurous
career
he
had
acquired
a
more
than
ordinary
share
of
experience
of
the
world
stone
blind
as
he
was
from
his
childhood
he
had
not
been
able
to
study
books
but
he
had
carefully
studied
men
he
could
read
characters
with
wonderful
quickness
rapidly
taking
stock
as
he
called
it
of
those
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
in
his
youth
as
we
have
seen
he
could
follow
the
hounds
on
horse
or
on
foot
and
managed
to
be
in
at
the
death
with
the
most
expert
riders
his
travels
about
the
country
as
a
guide
to
those
who
could
see
as
a
musician
soldier
chapman
and
waggoner
had
given
him
a
perfectly
familiar
acquaintance
with
the
northern
roads
he
could
measure
timber
or
hay
in
the
stack
and
rapidly
reduce
their
contents
to
feet
and
inches
after
a
mental
process
of
his
own
withal
he
was
endowed
with
an
extraordinary
activity
and
spirit
of
enterprise
which
had
his
sight
been
spared
him
would
probably
have
rendered
him
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
men
of
his
age
as
it
was
metcalf
now
became
one
of
the
greatest
of
its
and
image
john
metcalf
the
blind
about
the
year
an
act
was
passed
empowering
a
to
be
constructed
between
harrogate
and
boroughbridge
the
business
of
contractor
had
not
yet
come
into
existence
nor
was
the
art
of
much
understood
and
in
a
remote
country
place
such
as
knaresborough
the
surveyor
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
persons
capable
of
executing
the
necessary
work
the
shrewd
metcalf
discerned
in
the
proposed
enterprise
the
first
of
a
series
of
public
roads
of
a
similar
kind
throughout
the
northern
counties
for
none
knew
better
than
he
did
how
great
was
the
need
of
them
he
determined
therefore
to
enter
upon
this
new
line
of
business
and
offered
to
ostler
the
master
surveyor
to
construct
three
miles
of
the
proposed
road
between
minskip
and
fearnsby
ostler
knew
the
man
well
and
having
the
greatest
confidence
in
his
abilities
he
let
him
the
contract
metcalf
sold
his
and
his
interest
in
the
carrying
business
between
york
and
knaresborough
and
at
once
proceeded
with
his
new
undertaking
the
materials
for
metaling
the
road
were
to
be
obtained
from
one
for
the
whole
length
and
he
made
his
arrangements
on
a
large
scale
accordingly
hauling
out
the
ballast
with
unusual
expedition
and
economy
at
the
same
time
proceeding
with
the
formation
of
the
road
at
all
points
by
which
means
he
was
enabled
the
first
to
complete
his
contract
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
the
surveyor
and
trustees
this
was
only
the
first
of
a
vast
number
of
similar
projects
on
which
metcalf
was
afterwards
engaged
extending
over
a
period
of
more
than
thirty
years
by
the
time
that
he
had
finished
the
road
the
building
of
a
bridge
at
boroughbridge
was
advertised
and
metcalf
sent
in
his
tender
with
many
others
at
the
same
time
he
frankly
stated
that
though
he
wished
to
undertake
the
work
he
had
not
before
executed
anything
of
the
kind
his
tender
being
on
the
whole
the
most
favourable
the
trustees
sent
for
metcalf
and
on
his
appearing
before
them
they
asked
him
what
he
knew
of
a
bridge
he
replied
that
he
could
readily
describe
his
plan
of
the
one
they
proposed
to
build
if
they
would
be
good
enough
to
write
down
his
figures
the
span
of
the
arch
feet
said
he
being
a
semicircle
makes
the
must
be
a
foot
deep
which
if
multiplied
by
will
be
and
the
basis
will
be
feet
more
this
for
the
arch
but
it
will
require
good
backing
for
which
purpose
there
are
proper
stones
in
the
old
roman
wall
at
aldborough
which
may
be
used
for
the
purpose
if
you
please
to
give
directions
to
that
effect
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
trustees
were
able
to
follow
his
rapid
calculations
but
they
were
so
much
struck
by
his
readiness
and
apparently
complete
knowledge
of
the
work
he
proposed
to
execute
that
they
gave
him
the
contract
to
build
the
bridge
and
he
completed
it
within
the
stipulated
time
in
a
satisfactory
and
workmanlike
manner
he
next
agreed
to
make
the
mile
and
a
half
of
between
his
native
town
of
knaresborough
and
harrogate
ground
with
which
he
was
more
than
ordinarily
familiar
walking
one
day
over
a
portion
of
the
ground
on
which
the
road
was
to
be
made
while
still
covered
with
grass
he
told
the
workmen
that
he
thought
it
differed
from
the
ground
adjoining
it
and
he
directed
them
to
try
for
stone
or
gravel
underneath
and
strange
to
say
not
many
feet
down
the
men
came
upon
the
stones
of
an
old
roman
causeway
from
which
he
obtained
much
valuable
material
for
the
making
of
his
new
road
at
another
part
of
the
contract
there
was
a
bog
to
be
crossed
and
the
surveyor
thought
it
impossible
to
make
a
road
over
it
metcalf
assured
him
that
he
could
readily
accomplish
it
on
which
the
other
offered
if
he
succeeded
to
pay
him
for
the
straight
road
the
price
which
he
would
have
to
pay
if
the
road
were
constructed
round
the
bog
metcalf
set
to
work
accordingly
and
had
a
large
quantity
of
furze
and
ling
laid
upon
the
bog
over
which
he
spread
layers
of
gravel
the
plan
answered
effectually
and
when
the
materials
had
become
consolidated
it
proved
one
of
the
best
parts
of
the
road
it
would
be
tedious
to
describe
in
detail
the
construction
of
the
various
roads
and
bridges
which
metcalf
subsequently
executed
but
a
brief
summary
of
the
more
important
will
suffice
in
yorkshire
he
made
the
roads
between
harrogate
and
harewood
bridge
between
chapeltown
and
leeds
between
broughton
and
addingham
between
mill
bridge
and
halifax
between
wakefield
and
dewsbury
between
wakefield
and
doncaster
between
wakefield
huddersfield
and
saddleworth
the
manchester
road
between
standish
and
thurston
clough
between
huddersfield
and
highmoor
between
huddersfield
and
halifax
and
between
knaresborough
and
wetherby
in
lancashire
also
metcalf
made
a
large
extent
of
roads
which
were
of
the
greatest
importance
in
opening
up
the
resources
of
that
county
previous
to
their
construction
almost
the
only
means
of
communication
between
districts
was
by
and
of
sufficient
width
to
enable
a
laden
horse
to
pass
along
them
with
a
pack
of
goods
or
a
sack
of
corn
slung
across
its
back
principal
roads
in
lancashire
were
those
constructed
by
him
between
bury
and
blackburn
with
a
branch
to
accrington
between
bury
and
haslingden
and
between
haslingden
and
accrington
with
a
branch
to
blackburn
he
also
made
some
highly
important
main
roads
connecting
yorkshire
and
lancashire
with
each
other
at
many
parts
as
for
instance
those
between
skipton
colne
and
burnley
and
between
docklane
head
and
the
roads
from
ashton
to
stockport
and
from
stockport
to
mottram
langdale
were
also
his
work
our
was
also
extensively
employed
in
the
same
way
in
the
counties
of
cheshire
and
derby
constructing
the
roads
between
macclesfield
and
between
whaley
and
buxton
between
congleton
and
the
red
bull
entering
staffordshire
and
in
various
other
directions
the
total
mileage
of
the
thus
constructed
was
about
one
hundred
and
eighty
miles
for
which
metcalf
received
in
all
about
thousand
pounds
the
making
of
these
roads
also
involved
the
building
of
many
bridges
and
culverts
we
believe
it
was
generally
admitted
of
the
works
constructed
by
metcalf
that
they
well
stood
the
test
of
time
and
use
and
with
a
degree
of
justifiable
pride
he
was
afterwards
accustomed
to
point
to
his
bridges
when
others
were
tumbling
during
floods
and
boast
that
none
of
his
had
fallen
this
extraordinary
man
not
only
made
the
highways
which
were
designed
for
him
by
other
surveyors
but
himself
personally
surveyed
and
laid
out
many
of
the
most
important
roads
which
he
constructed
in
difficult
and
mountainous
parts
of
yorkshire
and
lancashire
one
who
personally
knew
metcalf
thus
wrote
of
him
during
his
with
the
assistance
only
of
a
long
staff
i
have
several
times
met
this
man
traversing
the
roads
ascending
steep
and
rugged
heights
exploring
valleys
and
investigating
their
several
extents
forms
and
situations
so
as
to
answer
his
designs
in
the
best
manner
the
plans
which
he
makes
and
the
estimates
he
prepares
are
done
in
a
method
peculiar
to
himself
and
of
which
he
can
not
well
convey
the
meaning
to
others
his
abilities
in
this
respect
are
nevertheless
so
great
that
he
finds
constant
employment
most
of
the
roads
over
the
peak
in
derbyshire
have
been
altered
by
his
directions
particularly
those
in
the
vicinity
of
buxton
and
he
is
at
this
time
constructing
a
new
one
betwixt
wilmslow
and
congleton
to
open
a
communication
with
the
great
london
road
without
being
obliged
to
pass
over
the
mountains
i
have
met
this
blind
projector
while
engaged
in
making
his
survey
he
was
alone
as
usual
and
amongst
other
conversation
i
made
some
inquiries
respecting
this
new
road
it
was
really
astonishing
to
hear
with
what
accuracy
he
described
its
course
and
the
nature
of
the
different
soils
through
which
it
was
conducted
having
mentioned
to
him
a
boggy
piece
of
ground
it
passed
through
he
observed
that
was
the
only
place
he
had
doubts
concerning
and
that
he
was
apprehensive
they
had
contrary
to
his
directions
been
too
sparing
of
their
materials
metcalf
skill
in
constructing
his
roads
over
boggy
ground
was
very
great
and
the
following
may
be
cited
as
an
instance
when
the
from
huddersfield
to
manchester
was
determined
on
he
agreed
to
make
it
at
so
much
a
rood
though
at
that
time
the
line
had
not
been
marked
out
when
this
was
done
metcalf
to
his
dismay
found
that
the
surveyor
had
laid
it
out
across
some
deep
marshy
ground
on
pule
and
standish
commons
on
this
he
expostulated
with
the
trustees
alleging
the
much
greater
expense
that
he
must
necessarily
incur
in
carrying
out
the
work
after
their
surveyor
plan
they
told
him
however
that
if
he
succeeded
in
making
a
complete
road
to
their
satisfaction
he
should
not
be
a
loser
but
they
pointed
out
that
according
to
their
views
it
would
be
requisite
for
him
to
dig
out
the
bog
until
he
came
to
a
solid
bottom
metcalf
on
making
his
calculations
found
that
in
that
case
he
would
have
to
dig
a
trench
some
nine
feet
deep
and
fourteen
yards
broad
on
the
average
making
about
two
hundred
and
solid
yards
of
bog
in
every
rood
to
be
excavated
and
carried
away
this
he
naturally
conceived
would
have
proved
both
tedious
as
well
as
costly
and
after
all
the
road
would
in
wet
weather
have
been
no
better
than
a
broad
ditch
and
in
winter
liable
to
be
blocked
up
with
snow
he
strongly
represented
this
view
to
the
trustees
as
well
as
the
surveyor
but
they
were
immovable
it
was
therefore
necessary
for
him
to
surmount
the
difficulty
in
some
other
way
though
he
remained
firm
in
his
resolution
not
to
adopt
the
plan
proposed
by
the
surveyor
after
much
cogitation
he
appeared
again
before
the
trustees
and
made
this
proposal
to
them
that
he
should
make
the
road
across
the
marshes
after
his
own
plan
and
then
if
it
should
be
found
not
to
answer
he
would
be
at
the
expense
of
making
it
over
again
after
the
surveyor
proposed
method
this
was
agreed
to
and
as
he
had
undertaken
to
make
nine
miles
of
the
road
within
ten
months
he
immediately
set
to
work
with
all
despatch
nearly
four
hundred
men
were
employed
upon
the
work
at
six
different
points
and
their
first
operation
was
to
cut
a
deep
ditch
along
either
side
of
the
intended
road
and
throw
the
excavated
stuff
inwards
so
as
to
raise
it
to
a
circular
form
his
greatest
difficulty
was
in
getting
the
stones
laid
to
make
the
drains
there
being
no
firm
footing
for
a
horse
in
the
more
boggy
places
the
yorkshire
clothiers
who
passed
that
way
to
huddersfield
market
by
no
means
a
race
ridiculed
metcalf
proceedings
and
declared
that
he
and
his
men
would
some
day
have
to
be
dragged
out
of
the
bog
by
the
hair
of
their
heads
undeterred
however
by
sarcasm
he
persistently
pursued
his
plan
of
making
the
road
practicable
for
laden
vehicles
but
he
strictly
enjoined
his
men
for
the
present
to
keep
his
manner
of
proceeding
a
secret
his
plan
was
this
he
ordered
heather
and
ling
to
be
pulled
from
the
adjacent
ground
and
after
binding
it
together
in
little
round
bundles
which
could
be
grasped
with
the
hand
these
bundles
were
placed
close
together
in
rows
in
the
direction
of
the
line
of
road
after
which
other
similar
bundles
were
placed
transversely
over
them
and
when
all
had
been
pressed
well
down
stone
and
gravel
were
led
on
in
waggons
and
spread
over
the
bundles
so
as
to
make
a
firm
and
level
way
when
the
first
load
was
brought
and
laid
on
and
the
horses
reached
the
firm
ground
again
in
safety
loud
cheers
were
set
up
by
the
persons
who
had
assembled
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
both
horses
and
waggons
disappear
in
the
bog
the
whole
length
was
finished
in
like
manner
and
it
proved
one
of
the
best
and
even
the
driest
parts
of
the
road
standing
in
very
little
need
of
repair
for
nearly
twelve
years
after
its
construction
the
plan
adopted
by
metcalf
we
need
scarcely
point
out
was
precisely
similar
to
that
afterwards
adopted
by
george
stephenson
under
like
circumstances
when
constructing
the
railway
across
chat
moss
it
consisted
simply
in
a
large
extension
of
the
bearing
surface
by
which
in
fact
the
road
was
made
to
float
upon
the
surface
of
the
bog
and
the
ingenuity
of
the
expedient
proved
the
practical
shrewdness
and
of
the
blind
metcalf
as
it
afterwards
illustrated
the
promptitude
as
well
as
skill
of
the

metcalf

upwards
of
seventy
years
old
before
he
left
off
he
was
still
hale
and
hearty
wonderfully
active
for
so
old
a
man
and
always
full
of
enterprise
occupation
was
absolutely
necessary
for
his
comfort
and
even
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
he
could
not
bear
to
be
idle
while
engaged
on
in
cheshire
he
brought
his
wife
to
stockport
for
a
time
and
there
she
died
after
years
of
happy
married
life
one
of
metcalf
daughters
became
married
to
a
person
engaged
in
the
cotton
business
at
stockport
and
as
that
trade
was
then
very
brisk
metcalf
himself
commenced
it
in
a
small
way
he
began
with
six
and
a
to
which
he
afterwards
added
looms
for
weaving
calicoes
jeans
and
velveteens
but
trade
was
fickle
and
finding
that
he
could
not
sell
his
yarns
except
at
a
loss
he
made
over
his
jennies
to
his
and
again
went
on
with
his
the
last
line
which
he
constructed
was
one
of
the
most
difficult
he
had
everundertaken
that
between
haslingden
and
accrington
with
a
branch
road
to
bury
numerous
canals
being
under
construction
at
the
same
time
employment
was
abundant
and
wages
rose
so
that
though
he
honourably
fulfilled
his
contract
and
was
paid
for
it
the
sum
of
he
found
himself
a
loser
of
exactly
after
two
years
labour
and
anxiety
he
completed
the
road
in
when
he
was
years
of
age
after
which
he
retired
to
his
farm
at
spofforth
near
wetherby
where
for
some
years
longer
he
continued
to
do
a
little
business
in
his
old
line
buying
and
selling
hay
and
standing
wood
and
superintending
the
operations
of
his
little
farm
during
the
later
years
of
his
career
he
occupied
himself
in
dictating
to
an
amanuensis
an
account
of
the
incidents
in
his
remarkable
life
and
finally
in
the
year
this
and
resolute
man

over

down

departed

depending
upon
the
public
spirit
and
enterprise
of

it
frequently
happened
that
while
the
roads
of
one
county
were
exceedingly
good
those
of
the
adjoining
county
were
altogether
execrable
even
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
metropolis
the
surrey
roads
remained
comparatively
unimproved
those
through
the
interior
of
kent
were
wretched
when
rennie
the
engineer
was
engaged
in
surveying
the
weald
with
a
view
to
the
cutting
of
a
canal
through
it
in
he
found
the
country
almost
destitute
of
practicable
roads
though
so
near
to
the
metropolis
on
the
one
hand
and
to
the
on
the
other
the
interior
of
the
county
was
then
comparatively
untraversed
except
by
bands
of
smugglers
who
kept
the
inhabitants
in
a
state
of
constant
terror
in
an
agricultural
report
on
the
county
of
northampton
as
late
as
the
year
it
was
stated
that
the
only
way
of
getting
along
some
of
the
main
lines
of
road
in
rainy
weather
was
by
swimming
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
of
lincoln
the
communications
were
little
better
and
there
still
stands
upon
what
is
called
lincoln

a

no

curious
memorial
of
the
past

on

heath
at
that
time
the
heath
was
not
only
uncultivated
but
it
was
also
unprovided
with
a
road
across
it
when
the
late
lady
robert
manners
visited
lincoln
from
her
residence
at
bloxholm
she
was
accustomed
to
send
forward
a
groom
to
examine
some
track
that
on
his
return
he
might
be
able
to
report
one
that
was
practicable
travellers
frequently
lost
themselves
upon
this
heath
thus
a
family
returning
from
a
ball
at
lincoln
strayed
from
the
track
twice
in
one
night
and
they
were
obliged
to
remain
there
until
morning
all
this
is
now
changed
and

has
become
covered
with
excellent
roads
and

of

up
no
longer

for
so
singular
a
purpose
did
appear
to
me
a
striking
witness
of
the
spirit
of
industry
which
in
our
own
days
has
reared
the
thriving
homesteads
around
it
and
spread
a
mantle
of
teeming
vegetation
to
its
very
base
and
it
was
certainly
surprising
to
discover
at
once
the
finest
farming
i
had
ever
seen
and
the
only
land
lighthouse
ever
raised
now
that
the
pillar
has
ceased
to
cheer
the
wayfarer
it
may
serve
as
a
beacon
to
encourage
other
landowners
in
converting
their
dreary
moors
into
similar
scenes
of
thriving
industry
when
the
improvement
of
the
high
roads
of
the
country
fairly
set
in
the
progress
made
was
very
rapid
this
was
greatly
stimulated
by
the
important
inventions
of
tools
machines
and
engines
made
towards
the
close
of
last
century
the
products
of
which

over

even
the

gave
place
to

travelling

was
pronounced
almost
perfect
but
all
this
was
not
enough
the
roads
and
canals
numerous
and
perfect
though
they
might
be
were
found
altogether
inadequate
to
the
accommodation
of
the
traffic
of
the
country
which
had
increased
at
a
constantly
accelerating
ratio
with
the
increased
application
of
steam
power
to
the
purposes
of
productive
industry
at
length
steam
itself
was
applied
to
remedy
the
inconveniences
which
it
had
caused
the
locomotive
engine
was
invented
and
travelling
by
railway
became
generally
adopted
the
effect
of
these
several
improvements
in
the
means
of
locomotion
has
been
to
greatly
increase
the
public
activity
and
to
promote
the
general
comfort
and
they
have
tended
to
bring
the
country
and
the
town
much
closer
together

by
annihilating
distance
as
measured
by
time
to
make
the
whole
kingdom

the

improved

of
those

on

which
the
hackney
coaches
were
at
the
beginning
of
my
life
whatever
miseries
i
suffered
there
was
no
post
to
whisk
my
complaints
for
a
single
penny
to
the
remotest
comer
of
the
empire
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
these
privations
i
lived
on
quietly
and
am
now
ashamed
that
i
was
not
more
discontented
and
utterly
surprised
that
all
these
changes
and
inventions
did
not
occur
two
centuries
ago
with
the
history
of
these
great
improvements
is
also
mixed
up
the
story
of
human
labour
and
genius
and
of
the
patience
and
perseverance
displayed
in
carrying
them
out
probably
one
of
the
best
illustrations
of
character
in
connection
with
the
development
of
the
inventions
of
the
last
century
is
to
be
found
in
the
life
of

of

be
supposed

supporting

the
principal

that
existed
in

was
of
a
lawless
kind
the
people
living
on
the
two
sides

looked
upon
each
other
cattle
as
their

he
might
possibly
have
lived
to
found
a
british
peerage
but
as
it
was
the
genius
of
the
armstrong
dynasty
was
for
a
time
extinguished
only
however
to
reappear
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
centuries
in
the
person
of
the
eminent
engineer
of
the
inventor
of
the
armstrong
gun
the
two
centuries
and
a
half
which
have
elapsed
since
then
have
indeed
seen
extraordinary
changes
the
energy
which
the
old
borderers
threw
into
their
feuds
has
not
become
extinct
but
survives
under
more
benignant
aspects
exhibiting
itself
in
efforts
to
enlighten
fertilize
and
enrich
the
country
which
their
wasteful
ardour
before
did
so
much
to
disturb
and
impoverish
the
heads
of
the
buccleugh
and
elliot
family
now
sit
in
the
british
house
of

the
descendant
of
scott
of
harden
has
achieved
a
reputation
as
a
poet
and
novelist
and
the
late
sir
james
graham
the
representative
of
the
graemes
of
netherby
on
the
english
side
of
the
border
was
one
of
the
most
venerable
and
respected
of
british
statesmen
the
border
men
who
used
to
make
such
furious
raids
and
forays
have
now
come
to
regard
each
other
across
the
imaginary
line
which
divides
them
as
friends
and
neighbours
and
they
meet
as
competitors
for
victory
only
at
agricultural
meetings
where
they
strive
to
win
prizes
for
the
biggest
turnips
or
the
most
effective
while
the
men
who
followed
their
johnstone
or
armstrong
chiefs
as
prickers
or
hobilers
to
the
fray
have
like
telford
crossed
the
border
with
powers
of
and
which
have
proved
a
source
of
increased
civilization
and
to
the
population
of
the
entire
united
kingdom
the
hamlet
of
westerkirk
with
its
parish
church
and
school
lies
in
a
narrow
part
of
the
valley
a
few
miles
above
langholm
westerkirk
parish
is
long
and
narrow
its
boundaries
being
the
on
either
side
of
the
dale
it
is
about
seven
miles
long
and
two
broad
with
a
population
of
about
persons
of
all
ages
yet
this
number
is
quite
as
much
as
the
district
is
able
to
support
as
is
proved
by
its
remaining
as
nearly
as
possible
stationary
from
one
generation
to
another
but
what
becomes
of
the
natural
increase
of
families
they
swarm
off
was
the
explanation
given
to
us
by
a
native
of
the
valley
if
they
remained
at
home
said
he
we
should
all
be
sunk
in
poverty
scrambling
with
each
other
amongst
these
hills
for
a
bare
living
but
our
peasantry
have
a
spirit
above
that
they
will
not
consent
to
sink
they
look
up
and
our
parish
schools
give
them
a
power
of
making
their
way
in
the
world
each
man
for
himself
so
they
swarm
off
some
to
america
some
to
australia
some
to
india
and
some
like
telford
work
their
way
across
the
border
and
up
to
london
one
would
scarcely
have
expected
to
find
the
birthplace
of
the
builder
of
the
menai
bridge
and
other
great
national
works
in
so
obscure
a
corner
of
the
kingdom
possibly
it
may
already
have
struck
the
reader
with
surprise
that
not
only
were
all
the
early
engineers
in
their
profession
but
they
were
brought
up
mostly
in
remote
country
places
far
from
the
active
life
of
great
towns
and
cities
but
genius
is
of
no
locality
and
springs
alike
from
the
farmhouse
the
peasant
hut
or
the
herd
shieling
strange
indeed
it
is
that
the
men
who
have
built
our
bridges
docks
lighthouses
canals
and
railways
should
nearly
all
have
been
boys
edwards
and
brindley
the
sons
of
small
farmers

of

and
freeholder
and

in
a
colliery
village
an
son
but
telford
even
more
than
any
of
these
was
a
purely
boy
and
was
born
and
brought
up
in
a
valley
so
secluded
that
it
could
not
even
boast
of
a
cluster
of
houses
of
the
dimensions
of
a
village
telford
father
was
a
herd
on
the
of
glendinning
the
farm
consists
of
green
hills
lying
along
the
valley
of
the
meggat
a
little
burn
which
descends
from
the
moorlands
on
the
east
and
falls
into
the
esk
near
the
hamlet
of
westerkirk
john
cottage
was
little
better
than
a
shieling
consisting
of
four
mud
walls
spanned
by
a
thatched
roof
it
stood
upon
a
knoll
near
the
lower
end
of
a
gully
worn
in
the
hillside
by
the
torrents
of
many
winters
the
ground
stretches
away
from
it
in
a
long
sweeping
slope
up
to
the
sky
and
is
green
to
the
top
except
where
the
bare
grey
rocks
in
some
places
crop
out
to
the
day
from
the
knoll
may
be
seen
miles
on
miles
of
hills
up
and
down
the
valley
winding
in
and
out
sometimes
branching
off
into
smaller
glens
each
with
its
gurgling
rivulet
of
water
flowing
down
from
the
mosses
above
only
a
narrow
strip
of
arable
land
is
here
and
there
visible
along
the
bottom
of
the
dale
all
above
being
moors
and
rocks
at
glendinning
you
seem
to
have
got
almost
to
the
world
end
there
the
road
ceases
and
above
it
stretch
trackless
moors
the
solitude
of
which
is
broken
only
by
the
whimpling
sound
of
the
burns
on
their
way
to
the
valley
below
the
hum
of
bees
gathering
honey
among
the
heather
the
whirr
of
a
blackcock
on
the
wing
the
plaintive
cry
of

of

gathering

the
fauld

telford
birthplace
in
this
cottage
on
the
knoll
thomas
telford
was
born
on
the
of
august
and
before
the
year
was
out
he
was
already
an
orphan
the
shepherd
his
father
died
in
the
month
of
november
and
was
buried
in
westerkirk
churchyard
leaving
behind
him
his
widow
and
her
only
child
altogether
unprovided
for
we
may
here
mention
that
one
of
the
first
things
which
that
child
did
when
he
had
grown
up
to
manhood
and
could
cut
a
headstone
was
to
erect
one
with
the
following
inscription
hewn
and
lettered
by
himself
over
his
father
grave
in
memory
of
john
telford
who
after
living
years
an
unblameable
shepherd
died
at
glendinning
november
a
simple
but
poetical
epitaph
which
wordsworth
himself
might
have
written
the
widow
had
a
long
and
hard
struggle
with
the
world
before
her
but
she
encountered
it
bravely
she
had
her
boy
to
work
for
and
destitute
though
she
was
she
had
him
to
educate
she
was
helped
as
the
poor
so
often
are
by
those
of
her
own
condition
and
there
is
no
sense
of
degradation
in
receiving
such
help
one
of
the
risks
of
benevolence
is
its
tendency
to
lower
the
recipient
to
the
condition
of
an
doles
from
have
this
enfeebling
effect
but
a
poor
neighbour
giving
a
destitute
widow
a
help
in
her
time
of
need
is
felt
to
be
a
friendly
act
and
is
alike
elevating
to
the
character
of
both
though
misery
such
as
is
witnessed
in
large
towns
was
quite
unknown
in
the
valley
there
was
poverty
but
it
was
honest
as
well
as
hopeful
and
none
felt
ashamed
of
it
the
farmers
of
the
dale
were
very
in
their
manners
and
habits
and
being
a
though
by
no
means
a
demonstrative
race
they
were
kind
to
the
widow
and
her
fatherless
boy
they
took
him
by
turns
to
live
with
them
at
their
houses
and
gave
his
mother
occasional
employment
in
summer
she
milked
the
ewes
and
made
hay
and
in
harvest
she
went
contriving
not
only
to
live
but
to
be
cheerful
the
house
to
which
the
widow
and
her
son
removed
at
the
whitsuntide
following
the
death
of
her
husband
was
at
a
place
called
the
crooks
about
midway
between
glendinning
and
westerkirk
it
was
a
thatched
with
two
ends
in
one
of
which
lived
janet
telford
more
commonly
known
by
her
own
name
of
janet
jackson
and
her
son
tom
and
in
the
other
her
neighbour
elliot
one
door
being
common
to
both
image
cottage
at
the
crooks
young
telford
grew
up
a
healthy
boy
and
he
was
so
full
of
fun
and
humour
that
he
became
known
in
the
valley
by
the
name
of
laughing
tam
when
he
was
old
enough
to
herd
sheep
he
went
to
live
with
a
relative
a
shepherd
like
his
father
and
he
spent
most
of
his
time
with
him
in
summer
on
the
amidst
the
silence
of
nature
in
winter
he
lived
with
one
or
other
of
the
neighbouring
farmers
he
herded
their
cows
or
ran
errands
receiving
for
recompense
his
meat
a
pair
of
stockings
and
five
shillings
a
year
for
clogs
these
were
his
first
wages
and
as
he
grew
older
they
were
gradually
increased
but
tom
must
now
be
put
to
school
and
happily
small
though
the
parish
of
westerkirk
was
it
possessed
the
advantage
of
that
admirable
institution
the
parish
school
the
legal
provision
made
at
an
early
period
for
the
education
of
the
people
in
scotland
proved
one
of
their
greatest
boons
by
imparting
the
rudiments
of
knowledge
to
all
the
parish
schools
of
the
country
placed
the
children
of
the
peasantry
on
a
more
equal
footing
with
the
children
of
the
rich
and
to
that
extent
redressed
the
inequalities
of
fortune
to
start
a
poor
boy
on
the
road
of
life
without
instruction
is
like
starting
one
on
a
race
with
his
eyes
bandaged
or
his
leg
tied
up
compared
with
the
educated
son
of
the
rich
man
the
former
has
but
little
chance
of
sighting
the
winning
post
to
our
orphan
boy
the
merely
elementary
teaching
provided
at
the
parish
school
of
westerkirk
was
an
immense
boon
to
master
this
was
the
first
step
of
the
ladder
he
was
afterwards
to
mount
his
own
industry
energy
and
ability
must
do
the
rest
to
school
accordingly
he
went
still
working
or
herding
cattle
during
the
summer
months
perhaps
his
own
penny
fee
helped
to
pay
the
teacher
hire
but
it
is
supposed
that
his
cousin
jackson
defrayed
the
principal
part
of
the
expense
of
his
instruction
it
was
not
much
that
he
learnt
but
in
acquiring
the
arts
of
reading
writing
and
figures
he
learnt
the
beginnings
of
a
great
deal
apart
from
the
question
of
learning
there
was
another
manifest
advantage
to
the
poor
boy
in
mixing
freely
at
the
parish
school
with
the
sons
of
the
neighbouring
farmers
and
proprietors
such
intercourse
has
an
influence
upon
a
youth
temper
manners
and
tastes
which
is
quite
as
important
in
the
education
of
character
as
the
lessons
of
the
master
himself
and
telford
often
in
after
life
referred
with
pleasure
to
the
benefits
which
he
had
derived
from
his
early
school
friendships
among
those
to
whom
he
was
accustomed
to
look
back
with
most
pride
were
the
two
elder
brothers
of
the
malcolm

whom
rose
to

rank

of
their
country

andrew

established
himself

that

hold
the
memory
of
johnnie

in
very
high
respect
it
was
long
before
the
reformation
flowed
into
the
secluded
valley
of
the
esk
but
when
it
did
the
energy
of
the
borderers
displayed
itself
in
the
extreme
form
of
their
opposition
to
the
old
religion
the
eskdale
people
became
as
resolute
in

at

gone
about

from
one
generation
to

in

yet
though
secluded

apparently
shut
out
by
the
surrounding
hills
from
the
outer
world
there
is
not
a
throb
of
the
nation
heart
but
pulsates
along
the
valley
and
when
the
author
visited
it
some
years
since
he
found
that
a
wave
of
the
great
volunteer
movement
had
flowed
into
eskdale

the
lads
of
langholm
were
drilling
and
marching

even
more
zeal
than

the

to
find

his
father
and
his
uncle
or
was
he
to
be
a
or
put
apprentice
to
a
trade
there
was
not
much
choice
but
at
length
it
was
determined
to
bind
him
to
a
stonemason
in
eskdale
that
trade
was
for
the
most
part
confined
to
the
building
of
drystone
walls
and
there
was
very
little
more
art
employed
in
it
than
an
ordinarily
labourer
could
manage
it
was
eventually
decided
to
send
the
youth
and
he
was
now
a
strong
lad
of
about
fifteen
to
a
mason
at
lochmaben
a
small
town
across
the
hills
to
the
westward
where
a
little
more
building
and
of
a
better
sort
such
as
of
barns
and
was
carried
on
than
in
his
own
immediate
neighbourhood
there
he
remained
only
a
few
months
for
his
master
using
him
badly
the
youth
would
not
brook
it
and
ran
away
taking
refuge
with
his
mother
at
the
crooks
very
much
to
her
dismay
what
was
now
to
be
done
with
tom
he
was
willing
to
do
anything
or
go
anywhere
rather
than
back
to
his
lochmaben
master
in
this
emergency
his
cousin
thomas
jackson
the
factor
or
at
wester
hall
offered
to
do
what
he
could
to
induce
andrew
thomson
a
small
mason
at
langholm
to
take
telford
for
the
remainder
of
his
apprenticeship
and
to
him
he
went
accordingly
the
business
carried
on
by
his
new
master
was
of
a
very
humble
sort
telford
in
his
autobiography
states
that
most
of
the
farmers
houses
in
the
district
then
consisted
of
one
storey
of
mud
walls
or
rubble
stones
bedded
in
clay
and
thatched
with
straw
rushes
or
heather
the
floors
being
of
earth
and
the
fire
in
the
middle
having
a
plastered
creel
chimney
for
the
escape
of
the
smoke
while
instead
of
windows
small
openings
in
the
thick
mud
walls
admitted
a
scanty
light
the
were
of
a
similarly
wretched
description
the
principal
owner
of
the
landed
property
in
the
neighbourhood
was
the
duke
of
buccleugh
shortly
after
the
young
duke
henry
succeeded
to
the
title
and
estates
in
he
introduced
considerable
improvements
in
the
farmers
houses
and
and
the
peasants
dwellings
as
well
as
in
the
roads
throughout
eskdale
thus
a
demand
sprang
up
for
masons
labour
and
telford
master
had
no
want
of
regular
employment
for
his
hands
telford
profited
by
the
experience
which
this
increase
in
the
building
operations
of
the
neighbourhood
gave
him
being
employed
in
raising
rough
walls
and
farm
enclosures
as
well
as
in
erecting
bridges
across
rivers
wherever
regular
roads
for
wheel
carriages
were
substituted
for
the
formerly
in
use
during
the
greater
part
of
his
apprenticeship
telford
lived
in
the
little
town
of
langholm
taking
frequent
opportunities
of
visiting
his
mother
at
the
crooks
on
saturday
evenings
and
accompanying
her
to
the
parish
church
of
westerkirk
on
sundays
langholm
was
then
a
very
poor
place
being
no
better
in
that
respect
than
the
district
that
surrounded
it
it
consisted
chiefly
of
mud
hovels
covered
with
thatch
the
principal
building
in
it
being
the
tolbooth
a
stone
and
lime
structure
the
upper
part
of
which
was
used
as
a
and
the
lower
part
as
a
gaol
there
were
however
a
few
good
houses
in
the
little
town
occupied
by
people
of
the
better
class
and
in
one
of
these
lived
an
elderly
lady
miss
pasley
one
of
the
family
of
the
pasleys
of
craig
as
the
town
was
so
small
that
everybody
in
it
knew
everybody
else
the
laughing
mason
apprentice
soon
became
generally
known
to
all
the
townspeople
and
amongst
others
to
miss
pasley
when
she
heard
that
he
was
the
poor
orphan
boy
from
up
the
valley
the
son
of
the
widow
woman
janet
jackson
so
eident
and
so
industrious
her
heart
warmed
to
the
mason
apprentice
and
she
sent
for
him
to
her
house
that
was
a
proud
day
for
tom
and
when
he
called
upon
her
he
was
not
more
pleased
with
miss
kindness
than
delighted
at
the
sight
of
her
little
library
of
books
which
contained
more
volumes
than
he
had
ever
seen
before
having
by
this
time
acquired
a
strong
taste
for
reading
and
exhausted
all
the
little
book
stores
of
his
friends
the
joy
of
the
young
mason
may
be
imagined
when
miss
pasley
volunteered
to
lend
him
some
books
from
her
own
library
of
course
he
eagerly
and
thankfully
availed
himself
of
the
privilege
and
thus
while
working
as
an
apprentice
and
afterwards
as
a
journeyman
telford
gathered
his
first
knowledge
of
british
literature
in
which
he
was
accustomed
to
the
close
of
his
life
to
take
such
pleasure
he
almost
always
had
some
book
with
him
which
he
would
snatch
a
few
minutes
to
read
in
the
intervals
of
his
work
and
on
winter
evenings
he
occupied
his
spare
time
in
poring
over
such
volumes
as
came
in
his
way
usually
with
no
better
light
than
the
cottage
fire
on
one
occasion
miss
pasley
lent
him
lost
and
he
took
the
book
with
him
to
the
to
read
his
delight
was
such
that
it
fairly
taxed
his
powers
of
expression
to
describe
it
he
could
only
say
i
read
and
read
and
glowred
then
read
and
read
again
he
was
also
a
great
admirer
of
burns
whose
writings
so
inflamed
his
mind
that
at
the
age
of
when
barely
out
of
his
apprenticeship
we
find
the
young
mason
actually
breaking
out
in
verse
by
diligently
reading
all
the
books
that
he
could
borrow
from
friends
and
neighbours
telford
made
considerable
progress
in
his
learning
and
what
with
his
scribbling
of
poetry
and
various
attempts
at
composition
he
had
become
so
good
and
legible
a
writer
that
he
was
often
called
upon
by
his
acquaintances
to
pen
letters
for
them
to
their
distant
friends
he
was
always
willing
to
help
them
in
this
way
and
the
other
working
people
of
the
town
making
use
of
his
services
in
the
same
manner
all
the
little
domestic
and
family
histories
of
the
place
soon
became
familiar
to
him
one
evening
a
langholm
man
asked
tom
to
write
a
letter
for
him
to
his
son
in
england
and
when
the
young
scribe
read
over
what
had
been
written
to
the
old
man
dictation
the
latter
at
the
end
of
almost
every
sentence
exclaimed
capital
capital
and
at
the
close
he
said
well
i
declare
tom
werricht
himsel
couldna
ha
written
a
better
wright
being
a
lawyer
or
writer
in
langholm
his
apprenticeship
over
telford
went
on
working
as
a
journeyman
at
langholm
his
wages
at
the
time
being
only
eighteen
pence
a
day
what
was
called
the
new
town
was
then
in
course
of
erection
and
there
are
houses
still
pointed
out
in
it
the
walls
of
which
telford
helped
to
put
together
in
the
town
are
three
arched
of
a
more
ornamental
character
than
the
rest
of
hewing
for
he
was
already
beginning
to
set
up
his
pretensions
as
a
craftsman
and
took
pride
in
pointing
to
the
superior
handiwork
which
proceeded
from
his
chisel
about
the
same
time
the
bridge
connecting
the
old
with
the
new
town
was
built
across
the
esk
at
langholm
and
upon
that
structure
he
was
also
employed
many
of
the
stones
in
it
were
hewn
by
his
hand
and
on
several
of
the
blocks
forming
the
his
is
still
to
be
seen
not
long
after
the
bridge
was
finished
an
unusually
high
flood
or
spate
swept
down
the
valley
the
esk
was
roaring
red
frae
bank
to
brae
and
it
was
generally
feared
that
the
new
brig
would
be
carried
away
robin
hotson
the
master
mason
was
from
home
at
the
time
and
his
wife
tibby
knowing
that
he
was
bound
by
his
contract
to
maintain
the
fabric
for
a
period
of
seven
years
was
in
a
state
of
great
alarm
she
ran
from
one
person
to
another
wringing
her
hands
and
sobbing
oh
we
be
ruined
we
a
be
ruined
in
her
distress
she
thought
of
telford
in
whom
she
had
great
confidence
and
called
out
oh
where
tammy
telfer
where
tammy
he
was
immediately
sent
for
it
was
evening
and
he
was
soon
found
at
the
house
of
miss
pasley
when
he
came
running
up
tibby
exclaimed
oh
tammy
they
been
on
the
brig
and
they
say
its
shakin
it
be
doon
never
you
heed
them
tibby
said
telford
clapping
her
on
the
shoulder
there
nae
fear
o
the
brig
i
like
it
a
the
better
that
it
shakes
it
proves
its
weel
put
thegither
tibby
fears
however
were
not
so
easily
allayed
and
insisting
that
she
heard
the
brig
rumlin
she
ran
up
so
the
neighbours
afterwards
used
to
say
of
her
and
set
her
back
against
the
parapet
to
hold
it
together
at
this
it
is
said
tam
bodged
and
leuch
and
tibby
observing
how
easily
he
took
it
at
length
grew
more
calm
it
soon
became
clear
enough
that
the
bridge
was
sufficiently
strong
for
the
flood
subsided
without
doing
it
any
harm
and
it
has
stood
the
furious
spates
of
nearly
a
century
uninjured
telford
acquired
considerable
general
experience
about
the
same
time
as
a
though
the
structures
on
which
he
was
engaged
were
of
a
humble
order
being
chiefly
small
on
the
duke
of
buccleugh
estate
with
the
usual
perhaps
the
most
important
of
the
jobs
on
which
he
was
employed
was
the
manse
of
westerkirk
where
he
was
comparatively
at
home
the
hamlet
stands
on
a
green
a
little
below
the
entrance
to
the
valley
of
the
meggat
it
consists
of
the
kirk
the
manse
the
and
a
few
cottages
every
occupant
of
which
was
known
to
telford
it
is
backed
by
the
purple
moors
up
which
he
loved
to
wander
in
his
leisure
hours
and
read
the
poems
of
fergusson
and
burns
the
river
esk
gurgles
along
its
rocky
bed
in
the
bottom
of
the
dale
separated
from
the
kirkyard
by
a
steep
bank
covered
with
natural
wood
while
near
at
hand
behind
the
manse
stretch
the
fine
woods
of
wester
hall
where
telford
was
often
wont
to
roam
image
valley
of
eskdale
westerkirk
in
the
distance
we
can
scarcely
therefore
wonder
that
amidst
such
pastoral
scenery
and
reading
such
books
as
he
did
the
poetic
faculty
of
the
country
mason
should
have
become
so
decidedly
developed
it
was
while
working
at
westerkirk
manse
that
he
sketched
the
first
draft
of
his
descriptive
poem
entitled
which
was
published
in
the
museum
in
these
early
poetical
efforts
were
at
least
useful
in
stimulating
his
for
the
practice
of
poetical
composition
while
it
cultivates
the
sentiment
of
beauty
in
thought
and
feeling
is
probably
the
best
of
all
exercises
in
the
art
of
writing
correctly
grammatically
and
expressively
by
drawing
a
man
out
of
his
ordinary
calling
too
it
often
furnishes
him
with
a
power
of
happy
thinking
which
may
in
after
life
become
a
source
of
the
purest
pleasure
and
this
we
believe
proved
to
be
the
case
with
telford
even
though
he
ceased
in
later
years
to
pursue
the
special
cultivation
of
the
art
shortly
after
when
work
became
slack
in
the
district
telford
undertook
to
do
small
jobs
on
his
own
account
such
as
the
hewing
of
and
ornamental
doorheads
he
prided
himself
especially
upon
his
hewing
and
from
the
specimens
of
his
workmanship
which
are
still
to
be
seen
in
the
churchyards
of
langholm
and
westerkirk
he
had
evidently
attained
considerable
skill
on
some
of
these
pieces
of
masonry
the
year
is
carved
or
one
of
the
most
ornamental
is
that
set
into
the
wall
of
westerkirk
church
being
a
monumental
slab
with
an
inscription
and
moulding
surmounted
by
a
coat
of
arms
to
the
memory
of
james
pasley
of
craig
he
had
now
learnt
all
that
his
native
valley
could
teach
him
of
the
art
of
masonry
and
bent
upon
and
gaining
a
larger
experience
of
life
as
well
as
knowledge
of
his
trade
he
determined
to
seek
employment
elsewhere
he
accordingly
left
eskdale
for
the
first
time
in
and
sought
work
in
edinburgh
where
the
new
town
was
then
in
course
of
erection
on
the
elevated
land
formerly
green
fields
extending
along
the
north
bank
of
the
nor
loch
a
bridge
had
been
thrown
across
the
loch
in
the
stagnant
pond
or
marsh
in
the
hollow
had
been
filled
up
and
princes
street
was
rising
as
if
by
magic
skilled
masons
were
in
great
demand
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
these
and
the
numerous
other
architectural
improvements
which
were
in
progress
and
telford
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
employment
our
remained
at
edinburgh
for
about
two
years
during
which
he
had
the
advantage
of
taking
part
in
work
and
maintaining
himself
comfortably
while
he
devoted
much
of
his
spare
time
to
drawing
in
its
application
to
architecture
he
took
the
opportunity
of
visiting
and
carefully
studying
the
fine
specimens
of
ancient
work
at
holyrood
house
and
chapel
the
castle
hospital
and
the
numerous
curious
illustrations
of
middle
age
domestic
architecture
with
which
the
old
town
abounds
he
also
made
several
journeys
to
the
beautiful
old
chapel
of
rosslyn
situated
some
miles
to
the
south
of
edinburgh
making
careful
drawings
of
the
more
important
parts
of
that
building
when
he
had
thus
improved
himself
and
studied
all
that
was
to
be
seen
in
edinburgh
in
returning
to
the
western
border
he
says
i
visited
the
justly
celebrated
abbey
of
melrose
there
he
was
charmed
by
the
delicate
and
perfect
workmanship
still
visible
even
in
the
ruins
of
that
fine
old
abbey
and
with
his
folio
filled
with
sketches
and
drawings
he
made
his
way
back
to
eskdale
and
the
humble
cottage
at
the
crooks
but
not
to
remain
there
long
he
merely
wished
to
pay
a
parting
visit
to
his
mother
and
other
relatives
before
starting
upon
a
longer
journey
having
acquired
he
says
in
his
autobiography
the
rudiments
of
my
profession
i
considered
that
my
native
country
afforded
few
opportunities
of
exercising
it
to
any
extent
and
therefore
judged
it
advisable
like
many
of
my
countrymen
to
proceed
southward
where
industry
might
find
more
employment
and
be
better
remunerated
before
setting
out
he
called
upon
all
his
old
friends
and
acquaintances
in
the
dale
the
neighbouring
farmers
who
had
befriended
him
and
his
mother
when
struggling
with
poverty
his
schoolfellows
many
of
whom
were
preparing
to
migrate
like
himself
from
their
native
valley
and
the
many
friends
and
acquaintances
he
had
made
while
working
as
a
mason
in
langholm
everybody
knew
that
tom
was
going
south
and
all
wished
him
god
speed
at
length
the
was
over
and
he
set
out
for
london
in
the
year
when
years
old
he
had
like
the
little
river
meggat
on
the
banks
of
which
he
was
born
floated
gradually
on
towards
the
outer
world
first
from
the
nook
in
the
valley
to
westerkirk
school
then
to
langholm
and
its
little
circle
and
now
like
the
meggat
which
flows
with
the
esk
into
the
ocean
he
was
about
to
be
borne
away
into
the
wide
world
telford
however
had
confidence
in
himself
and
no
one
had
fears
for
him
as
the
neighbours
said
wisely
wagging
their
heads
ah
he
an
chap
is
tam
he
either
mak
a
spoon
or
spoil
a
horn
any
how
he
gatten
a
good
trade
at
his
fingers
ends
telford
had
made
all
his
previous
journeys
on
foot
but
this
one
he
made
on
horseback
it
happened
that
sir
james
johnstone
the
laird
of
wester
hall
had
occasion
to
send
a
horse
from
eskdale
to
a
member
of
his
family
in
london
and
he
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
a
person
to
take
charge
of
it
it
occurred
to
jackson
the
laird
factor
that
this
was
a
capital
opportunity
for
his
cousin
tom
the
mason
and
it
was
accordingly
arranged
that
he
should
ride
the
horse
to
town
when
a
boy
he
had
learnt
rough
riding
sufficiently
well
for
the
purpose
and
the
better
to
fit
him
for
the
hardships
of
the

by
telford
when
living
at

when
he
added
a
few
lines
by
way
of
conclusion
the
poem
describes
very
pleasantly
the
fine
pastoral
scenery
of
the
district
deep
the
green
sequester
glens
below
where
murmuring
streams
among
the
alders
flow
where
flowery
meadows
down
their
margins
spread
and
the
brown
hamlet
lifts
its
humble
head
there
round
his
little
fields
the
peasant
strays
and
sees
his
flock
along
the
mountain
graze
and
while
the
gale
breathes
his
ripening
grain
and
soft
repeats
his
upland
shepherd
strain
and
western
suns
with
mellow
radiance
play
and
gild
his
cottage
with
their
ray
feels
nature
love
his
throbbing
heart
employ
nor
envies
towns
their
artificial
joy
the
features
of
the
valley
are
very
fairly
described
its
early
history
is
then
rapidly
sketched
next
its
period
of
border
strife
at
length
happily
allayed
by
the
union
of
the
kingdoms
under
which
the
johnstones
pasleys
and
others
men
of
eskdale
achieve
honour
and
fame
nor
did
he
forget
to
mention
armstrong
the
author
of
the
of

son
of
the
minister
of
castleton
a
few
miles
east
of
westerkirk

mickle
the
translator
of
the
whose
father
was
minister
of

of

a
natural
pride

of

chapter
iii
telford
a
working
mason
in
london
and
foreman
of
masons
at
portsmouth
a
common
working
man
whose
sole
property
consisted
in
his
mallet
and
chisels
his
leathern
apron
and
his
industry
might
not
seem
to
amount
to
much
in
the
great
world
of
london
but
as
telford
afterwards
used
to
say
very
much
depends
on
whether
the
man
has
got
a
head
with
brains
in
it
of
the
right
sort
upon
his
shoulders
in
london
the
weak
man
is
simply
a
unit
added
to
the
vast
floating
crowd
and
may
be
driven
hither
and
thither
if
he
do
not
sink
altogether
while
the
strong
man
will
strike
out
keep
his
head
above
water
and
make
a
course
for
himself
as
telford
did
there
is
indeed
a
wonderful
impartiality
about
london
there
the
capable
person
usually
finds
his
place
when
work
of
importance
is
required
nobody
cares
to
ask
where
the
man
who
can
do
it
best
comes
from
or
what
he
has
been
but
what
he
is
and
what
he
can
do
nor
did
it
ever
stand
in
telford
way
that
his
father
had
been
a
poor
shepherd
in
eskdale
and
that
he
himself
had
begun
his
london
career
by
working
for
weekly
wages
with
a
mallet
and
chisel
after
duly
delivering
up
the
horse
telford
proceeded
to
present
a
letter
with
which
he
had
been
charged
by
his
friend
miss
pasley
on
leaving
langholm
it
was
addressed
to
her
brother
john
pasley
an
eminent
london
merchant
brother
also
of
sir
thomas
pasley
and
uncle
of
the
malcolms
miss
pasley
requested
his
influence
on
behalf
of
the
young
mason
from
eskdale
the
bearer
of
the
letter
pasley
received
his
countryman
kindly
and
furnished
him
with
letters
of
introduction
to
sir
william
chambers
the
architect
of
somerset
house
then
in
course
of
erection
it
was
the
finest
architectural
work
in
progress
in
the
metropolis
and
telford
desirous
of
improving
himself
by
experience
of
the
best
kind
wished
to
be
employed
upon
it
he
did
not
indeed
need
any
influence
to
obtain
work
there
for
good
hewers
were
in
demand
but
our
mason
thought
it
well
to
make
sure
and
accordingly
provided
himself
beforehand
with
the
letter
of
introduction
to
the
architect
he
was
employed
immediately
and
set
to
work
among
the
hewers
receiving
the
usual
wages
for
his
labour
pasley
also
furnished
him
with
a
letter
to
robert
adam
another
distinguished
architect
of
the
time
and
telford
seems
to
have
been
much
gratified
by
the
civility
which
he
receives
from
him
sir
william
chambers
he
found
haughty
and
reserved
probably
being
too
much
occupied
to
bestow
attention
on
the
somerset
house
hewer
while
he
found
adam
to
be
affable
and
communicative
although
i
derived
no
direct
advantage
from
either
telford
says
yet
so
powerful
is
manner
that
the
latter
left
the
most
favourable
impression
while
the
interviews
with
both
convinced
me
that
my
safest
plan
was
to
endeavour
to
advance
if
by
slower
steps
yet
by
independent
conduct
there
was
a
good
deal
of
fine
hewer
work
about
somerset
house
and
from
the
first
telford
aimed
at
taking
the
highest
place
as
an
artist
and
tradesman
in
that
line
diligence
carefulness
and
observation
will
always
carry
a
man
onward
and
upward
and
before
long
we
find
that
telford
had
succeeded
in
advancing
himself
to
the
rank
of
a
mason
judging
from
his
letters
written
about
this
time
to
his
friends
in
eskdale
he
seems
to
have
been
very
cheerful
and
happy
and
his
greatest
pleasure
was
in
calling
up
recollections
of
his
native
valley
he
was
full
of
kind
remembrances
for
everybody
how
is
andrew
and
sandy
and
aleck
and
davie
he
would
say
and
remember
me
to
all
the
folk
of
the
nook
he
seems
to
have
made
a
round
of
the
persons
from
eskdale
in
or
about
london
before
he
wrote
as
his
letters
were
full
of
messages
from
them
to
their
friends
at
home
for
in
those
days
postage
was
dear
and
as
much
as
possible
was
necessarily
packed
within
the
compass
of
a
working
man
letter
in
one
written
after
more
than
a
year
absence
he
said
he
envied
the
visit
which
a
young
surgeon
of
his
acquaintance
was
about
to
pay
to
the
valley
for
the
meeting
of
long
absent
friends
he
added
is
a
pleasure
to
be
equalled
by
few
other
enjoyments
here
below
he
had
now
been
more
than
a
year
in
london
during
which
he
had
acquired
much
practical
information
both
in
the
useful
and
ornamental
branches
of
architecture
was
he
to
go
on
as
a
working
mason
or
what
was
to
be
his
next
move
he
had
been
quietly
making
his
observations
upon
his
companions
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
very
much
wanted
spirit
and
more
than
all
forethought
he
found
very
clever
workmen
about
him
with
no
idea
whatever
beyond
their
week
wages
for
these
they
would
make
every
effort
they
would
work
hard
exert
themselves
to
keep
their
earnings
up
to
the
highest
point
and
very
readily
strike
to
secure
an
advance
but
as
for
making
a
provision
for
the
next
week
or
the
next
year
he
thought
them
exceedingly
thoughtless
on
the
monday
mornings
they
began
clean
and
on
saturdays
their
earnings
were
spent
thus
they
lived
from
one
week
to
another
their
limited
notion
of
the
week
seeming
to
bound
their
existence
telford
on
the
other
hand
looked
upon
the
week
as
only
one
of
the
storeys
of
a
building
and
upon
the
succession
of
weeks
running
on
through
years
he
thought
that
the
complete
life
structure
should
be
built
up
he
thus
describes
one
of
the
best
of
his
at
that
time
the
only
individual
he
had
formed
an
intimacy
with
he
has
been
six
years
at
somerset
house
and
is
esteemed
the
finest
workman
in
london
and
consequently
in
england
he
works
equally
in
stone
and
marble
he
has
excelled
the
professed
carvers
in
cutting
corinthian
capitals
and
other
ornaments
about
this
edifice
many
of
which
will
stand
as
a
monument
to
his
honour
he
understands
drawing
thoroughly
and
the
master
he
works
under
looks
on
him
as
the
principal
support
of
his
business
this
man
whose
name
is
hatton
may
be
half
a
dozen
years
older
than
myself
at
most
he
is
honesty
and
good
nature
itself
and
is
adored
by
both
his
master
and
notwithstanding
his
extraordinary
skill
and
abilities
he
has
been
working
all
this
time
as
a
common
journeyman
contented
with
a
few
shillings
a
week
more
than
the
rest
but
i
believe
your
uneasy
friend
has
kindled
a
spark
in
his
breast
that
he
never
felt
before
in
fact
telford
had
formed
the
intention
of
inducing
this
admirable
fellow
to
join
him
in
commencing
business
as
builders
on
their
own
account
there
is
nothing
done
in
stone
or
marble
he
says
that
we
can
not
do
in
the
completest
manner
robert
adam
to
whom
the
scheme
was
mentioned
promised
his
support
and
said
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
recommend
them
but
the
great
difficulty
was
money
which
neither
of
them
possessed
and
telford
with
grief
admitting
that
this
was
an
insuperable
bar
went
no
further
with
the
scheme
about
this
time
telford
was
consulted
by
respecting
the
alterations
making
in
the
mansion
at
wester
hall
and
was
often
with
him
on
this
business
we
find
him
also
writing
down
to
langholm
for
the
prices
of
roofing
masonry
and
with
a
view
to
preparing
estimates
for
a
friend
who
was
building
a
house
in
that
neighbourhood
although
determined
to
reach
the
highest
excellence
as
a
manual
worker
it
is
clear
that
he
was
already
aspiring
to
be
something
more
indeed
his
steadiness
perseverance
and
general
ability
pointed
him
out
as
one
well
worthy
of
promotion
how
he
achieved
his
next
step
we
are
not
informed
but
we
find
him
in
july
engaged
in
superintending
the
erection
of
a
house
after
a
design
by
samuel
wyatt
intended
for
the
residence
of
the
commissioner
now
occupied
by
the
port
admiral
at
portsmouth
dockyard
together
with
a
new
chapel
and
several
buildings
connected
with
the
yard
telford
took
care
to
keep
his
eyes
open
to
all
the
other
works
going
forward
in
the
neighbourhood
and
he
states
that
he
had
frequent
opportunities
of
observing
the
various
operations
necessary
in
the
foundation
and
construction
of
and
such
like
which
were
among
the
principal
occupations
of
his
the
letters
written
by
him
from
portsmouth
to
his
eskdale
correspondents
about
this
time
were
cheerful
and
hopeful
like
those
he
had
sent
from
london
his
principal
grievance
was
that
he
received
so
few
from
home
but
he
supposed
that
opportunities
for
forwarding
them
by
hand
had
not
occurred
postage
being
so
dear
as
scarcely
then
to
be
thought
of
to
tempt
them
to
correspondence
he
sent
copies
of
the
poems
which
he
still
continued
to
compose
in
the
leisure
of
his
evenings
one
of
these
was
a
on
portsdown
hill
as
for
himself
he
was
doing
very
well
the
buildings
were
advancing
satisfactorily
but
above
all
said
he
my
proceedings
are
entirely
approved
by
the
commissioners
and
officers
here
so
much
so
that
they
would
sooner
go
by
my
advice
than
my
master
which
is
a
dangerous
point
being
difficult
to
keep
their
good
graces
as
well
as
his
however
i
will
contrive
to
manage
it
the
following
is
his
own
account
of
the
manner
in
which
he
was
usually
occupied
during
the
winter
months
while
at
portsmouth
dock
i
rise
in
the
morning
at
february
and
will
get
up
earlier
as
the
days
lengthen
until
it
come
to
i
immediately
set
to
work
to
make
out
accounts
write
on
matters
of
business
or
draw
until
breakfast
which
is
at
then
i
go
into
the
yard
about
see
that
all
are
at
their
posts
and
am
ready
to
advise
about
any
matters
that
may
require
attention
this
and
going
round
the
several
works
occupies
until
about
which
is
at
and
after
that
i
again
go
round
and
attend
to
what
may
be
wanted
i
draw
till
then
tea
and
after
that
i
write
draw
or
read
until
half
after
then
comes
supper
and
bed
this
my
ordinary
round
unless
when
i
dine
or
spend
an
evening
with
a
friend
but
i
do
not
make
many
friends
being
very
particular
nay
nice
to
a
degree
my
business
requires
a
great
deal
of
writing
and
drawing
and
this
work
i
always
take
care
to
keep
under
by
reserving
my
time
for
it
and
being
in
advance
of
my
work
rather
than
behind
it
then
as
knowledge
is
my
most
ardent
pursuit
a
thousand
things
occur
which
call
for
investigation
which
would
pass
unnoticed
by
those
who
are
content
to
trudge
only
in
the
beaten
path
i
am
not
contented
unless
i
can
give
a
reason
for
every
particular
method
or
practice
which
is
pursued
hence
i
am
now
very
deep
in
chemistry
the
mode
of
making
mortar
in
the
best
way
led
me
to
inquire
into
the
nature
of
lime
having
in
pursuit
of
this
inquiry
looked
into
some
books
on
chemistry
i
perceived
the
field
was
boundless
but
that
to
assign
satisfactory
reasons
for
many
mechanical
processes
required
a
general
knowledge
of
that
science
i
have
therefore
borrowed
a
copy
of
lectures
i
have
bought
his
on
magnesia
and
quicklime
and
also
fourcroy
lectures
translated
from
the
french
by
one
elliot
of
edinburgh
and
i
am
determined
to
study
the
subject
with
unwearied
attention
until
i
attain
some
accurate
knowledge
of
chemistry
which
is
of
no
less
use
in
the
practice
of
the
arts
than
it
is
in
that
of
medicine
he
adds
that
he
continues
to
receive
the
cordial
approval
of
the
commissioners
for
the
manner
in
which
he
performs
his
duties
and
says
i
take
care
to
be
so
far
master
of
the
business
committed
to
me
as
that
none
shall
be
able
to
eclipse
me
in
that
respect
at
the
same
time
he
states
he
is
taking
great
delight
in
freemasonry
and
is
about
to
have
a
at
the
george
inn
fitted
up
after
his
plans
and
under
his
direction
nor
does
he
forget
to
add
that
he
has
his
hair
powdered
every
day
and
puts
on
a
clean
shirt
three
times
a
week
the
eskdale
mason
was
evidently
getting
on
as
he
deserved
to
do
but
he
was
not
puffed
up
to
his
langholm
friend
he
averred
that
he
would
rather
have
it
said
of
him
that
he
possessed
one
grain
of
good
nature
or
good
sense
than
shine
the
finest
puppet
in
christendom
let
my
mother
know
that
i
am
well
he
wrote
to
andrew
little
and
that
i
will
print
her
a
letter
soon
for
it
was
a
practice
of
this
good
son
down
to
the
period
of
his
mother
death
no
matter
how
much
burdened
he
was
with
business
to
set
apart
occasional
times
for
the
careful
penning
of
a
letter
in
printed
characters
that
she
might
the
more
easily
be
able
to
decipher
it
with
her
old
and
dimmed
eyes
by
her
cottage
fireside
at
the
crooks
as
a
man
real
disposition
usually
displays
itself
most
strikingly
in
small
matters
like
light
which
gleams
the
most
brightly
when
seen
through
narrow
chinks
it
will
probably
be
admitted
that
this
trait
trifling
though
it
may
appear
was
truly
characteristic
of
the
simple
and
affectionate
nature
of
the
hero
of
our
story
the
buildings
at
portsmouth
were
finished
by
the
end
of
when
telford
duties
there
being
at
an
end
and
having
no
engagement
beyond
the
termination
of
the
contract
he
prepared
to
leave
and
began
to
look
about
him
for
other
employment

with
a

pointing
to

pulteney
member
for
shrewsbury
was
the
owner
of
extensive
estates
in
that
neighbourhood
by
virtue
of
his
marriage
with
the
niece
of
the
last
earl
of
bath
having
resolved
to
fit
up
the
castle
there
as
a
residence
he
bethought
him
of
the
young
eskdale
mason
who
had
some
years
before
advised
him
as
to
the
repairs
of
the
johnstone
mansion
at
wester
hall
telford
was
soon
found
and
engaged
to
go
down
to
shrewsbury
to
superintend
the
necessary
alterations
their
execution
occupied
his
attention
for
some
time
and
during
their
progress
he
was
so
fortunate
as
to
obtain
the
appointment
of
surveyor
of
public
works
for
the
county
of
salop
most
probably
through
the
influence
of
his
patron
indeed
telford
was
known
to
be
so
great
a
favourite
with
pulteney
that
at
shrewsbury
he
usually
went
by
the
name
of
young
pulteney
much
of
his
attention
was
from
this
time
occupied
with
the
surveys
and
repairs
of
roads
bridges
and
gaols
and
the
supervision
of
all
public
buildings
under
the
control
of
the
magistrates
of
the
county
he
was
also
frequently
called
upon
by
the
corporation
of
the
borough
of
shrewsbury
to
furnish
plans
for
the
improvement
of
the
streets
and
buildings
of
that
fine
old
town
and
many
alterations
were
carried
out
under
his
direction
during
the
period
of
his
residence
there
while
the
castle
repairs
were
in
course
of
execution
telford
was
called
upon
by
the
justices
to
superintend
the
erection
of
a
new
gaol
the
plans
for
which
had
already
been
prepared
and
settled
the
benevolent
howard
who
devoted
himself
with
such
zeal
to
gaol
improvement
on
hearing
of
the
intentions
of
the
magistrates
made
a
visit
to
shrewsbury
for
the
purpose
of
examining
the
plans
and
the
circumstance
is
thus
adverted
to
by
telford
in
one
of
his
letters
to
his
eskdale
correspondent
about
ten
days
ago
i
had
a
visit
from
the
celebrated
john
howard
esq
i
say
i
for
he
was
on
his
tour
of
gaols
and
infirmaries
and
those
of
shrewsbury
being
both
under
my
direction
this
was
of
course
the
cause
of
my
being
thus
distinguished
i
accompanied
him
through
the
infirmary
and
the
gaol
i
showed
him
the
plans
of
the
proposed
new
buildings
and
had
much
conversation
with
him
on
both
subjects
in
consequence
of
his
suggestions
as
to
the
former
i
have
revised
and
amended
the
plans
so
as
to
carry
out
a
thorough
reformation
and
my
alterations
having
been
approved
by
a
general
board
they
have
been
referred
to
a
committee
to
carry
out
howard
also
took
objection
to
the
plan
of
the
proposed
gaol
and
requested
me
to
inform
the
magistrates
that
in
his
opinion
the
interior
courts
were
too
small
and
not
sufficiently
ventilated
and
the
magistrates
having
approved
his
suggestions
ordered
the
plans
to
be
amended
accordingly
you
may
easily
conceive
how
i
enjoyed
the
conversation
of
this
truly
good
man
and
how
much
i
would
strive
to
possess
his
good
opinion
i
regard
him
as
the
guardian
angel
of
the
miserable
he
travels
into
all
parts
of
europe
with
the
sole
object
of
doing
good
merely
for
its
own
sake
and
not
for
the
sake
of
men
praise
to
give
an
instance
of
his
delicacy
and
his
desire
to
avoid
public
notice
i
may
mention
that
being
a
presbyterian
he
attended
the
of
that
denomination
in
shrewsbury
on
sunday
morning
on
which
occasion
i
accompanied
him
but
in
the
afternoon
he
expressed
a
wish
to
attend
another
place
of
worship
his
presence
in
the
town
having
excited
considerable
curiosity
though
his
wish
was
to
avoid
public
recognition
nay
more
he
assures
me
that
he
hates
travelling
and
was
born
to
be
a
domestic
man
he
never
sees
his
but
he
says
within
himself
might
i
but
rest
here
and
never
more
travel
three
miles
from
home
then
should
i
be
happy
indeed
but
he
has
become
so
committed
and
so
pledged
himself
to
his
own
conscience
to
carry
out
his
great
work
that
he
says
he
is
doubtful
whether
he
will
ever
be
able
to
attain
the
desire
of
his
heart
life
at
home
he
never
dines
out
and
scarcely
takes
time
to
dine
at
all
he
says
he
is
growing
old
and
has
no
time
to
lose
his
manner
is
simplicity
itself
indeed
i
have
never
yet
met
so
noble
a
being
he
is
going
abroad
again
shortly
on
one
of
his
long
tours
of
mercy
the
journey
to
which
telford
here
refers
was
howard
last
in
the
following
year
he
left
england
to
return
no
more
and
the
great
and
good
man
died
at
cherson
on
the
shores
of
the
black
sea
less
than
two
years
after
his
interview
with
the
young
engineer
at
shrewsbury
telford
writes
to
his
langholm
friend
at
the
same
time
that
he
is
working
very
hard
and
studying
to
improve
himself
in
branches
of
knowledge
in
which
he
feels
himself
deficient
he
is
practising
very
temperate
habits
for
half
a
year
past
he
has
taken
to
drinking
water
only
avoiding
all
sweets
and
eating
no
he
has
sowens
and
milk
oatmeal
flummery
every
night
for
his
supper
his
friend
having
asked
his
opinion
of
politics
he
says
he
really
knows
nothing
about
them
he
had
been
so
completely
engrossed
by
his
own
business
that
he
has
not
had
time
to
read
even
a
newspaper
but
though
an
ignoramus
in
politics
he
has
been
studying
lime
which
is
more
to
his
purpose
if
his
friend
can
give
him
any
information
about
that
he
will
promise
to
read
a
newspaper
now
and
then
in
the
ensuing
session
of
parliament
for
the
purpose
of
forming
some
opinion
of
politics
he
adds
however
not
if
it
interfere
with
my
business
mind
that
his
friend
told
him
that
he
proposed
translating
a
system
of
chemistry
now
you
know
wrote
telford
that
i
am
chemistry
mad
and
if
i
were
near
you
i
would
make
you
promise
to
communicate
any
information
on
the
subject
that
you
thought
would
be
of
service
to
your
friend
especially
about
calcareous
matters
and
the
mode
of
forming
the
best
composition
for
building
with
as
well
above
as
below
water
but
not
to
be
confined
to
that
alone
for
you
must
know
i
have
a
book
for
the
pocket
which
i
always
carry
with
me
into
which
i
have
extracted
the
essence
of
fourcroy
lectures
black
on
quicklime
scheele
essays
watson
essays
and
various
points
from
the
letters
of
my
respected
friend
dr
irving
so
much
for
chemistry
but
i
have
also
crammed
into
it
facts
relating
to
mechanics
hydrostatics
pneumatics
and
all
manner
of
stuff
to
which
i
keep
continually
adding
and
it
will
be
a
charity
to
me
if
you
will
kindly
contribute
your
mite
he
says
it
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
his
aim
to
endeavour
to
unite
those
two
frequently
jarring
pursuits
literature
and
business
and
he
does
not
see
why
a
man
should
be
less
efficient
in
the
latter
capacity
because
he
has
well
informed
stored
and
humanized
his
mind
by
the
cultivation
of
letters
there
was
both
good
sense
and
sound
practical
wisdom
in
this
view
of
telford
while
the
gaol
was
in
course
of
erection
after
the
improved
plans
suggested
by
howard
a
variety
of
important
matters
occupied
the
county
surveyor
attention
during
the
summer
of
he
says
he
is
very
much
occupied
having
about
ten
different
jobs
on
hand
roads
bridges
streets
gaol
and
infirmary
yet
he
had
time
to
write
verses
copies
of
which
he
forwarded
to
his
eskdale
correspondent
inviting
his
criticism
several
of
these
were
elegiac
lines
somewhat
exaggerated
in
their
praises
of
the
deceased
though
doubtless
sincere
one
poem
was
in
memory
of
george
johnstone
a
member
of
the
wester
hall
family
and
another
on
the
death
of
william
telford
an
eskdale
farmer
son
an
intimate
friend
and
schoolfellow
of
our
engineer
these
however
were
but
the
votive
offerings
of
private
friendship
persons
more
immediately
about
him
knowing
nothing
of
his
stolen
pleasures
in
versemaking
he
continued
to
be
shy
of
strangers
and
was
very
nice
as
he
calls
it
as
to
those
whom
he
admitted
to
his
bosom
two
circumstances
of
considerable
interest
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
same
year
which
are
worthy
of
passing
notice
the
one
was
the
fall
of
the
church
of
chad
at
shrewsbury
the
other
was
the
discovery
of
the
ruins
of
the
roman
city
of
uriconium
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
the
church
of
was
about
four
centuries
old
and
stood
greatly
in
need
of
repairs
the
roof
let
in
the
rain
upon
the
congregation
and
the
parish
vestry
met
to
settle
the
plans
for
mending
it
but
they
could
not
agree
about
the
mode
of
procedure
in
this
emergency
telford
was
sent
for
and
requested
to
advise
what
was
best
to
he
done
after
a
rapid
glance
at
the
interior
which
was
in
an
exceedingly
dangerous
state
he
said
to
the
churchwardens
gentlemen
we
consult
together
on
the
outside
if
you
please
he
found
that
not
only
the
roof
but
the
walls
of
the
church
were
in
a
most
decayed
state
it
appeared
that
in
consequence
of
graves
having
been
dug
in
the
loose
soil
close
to
the
shallow
foundation
of
the
pillar
of
the
tower
it
had
sunk
so
as
to
endanger
the
whole
structure
i
discovered
says
he
that
there
were
large
fractures
in
the
walls
on
tracing
which
i
found
that
the
old
building
was
in
a
most
shattered
and
decrepit
condition
though
until
then
it
had
been
scarcely
noticed
upon
this
i
declined
giving
any
recommendation
as
to
the
repairs
of
the
roof
unless
they
would
come
to
the
resolution
to
secure
the
more
essential
parts
as
the
fabric
appeared
to
me
to
be
in
a
very
alarming
condition
i
sent
in
a
written
report
to
the
same
effect
the
parish
vestry
again
met
and
the
report
was
read
but
the
meeting
exclaimed
against
so
extensive
a
proposal
imputing
mere
motives
of
to
the
surveyor
popular
clamour
says
telford
overcame
my
report
fractures
exclaimed
the
vestrymen
been
there
from
time
immemorial
and
there
were
some
otherwise
sensible
persons
who
remarked
that
professional
men
always
wanted
to
carve
out
employment
for
themselves
and
that
the
whole
of
the
necessary
repairs
could
be
done
at
a
comparatively
small
expense
the
vestry
then
called
in
another
person
a
mason
of
the
town
and
directed
him
to
cut
away
the
injured
part
of
a
particular
pillar
in
order
to
underbuild
it
on
the
second
evening
after
the
commencement
of
the
operations
the
sexton
was
alarmed
by
a
fail
of
and
mortar
when
he
attempted
to
toll
the
great
bell
on
which
he
immediately
desisted
and
left
the
church
early
next
morning
on
the
of
july
while
the
workmen
were
waiting
at
the
church
door
for
the
key
the
bell
struck
four
and
the
vibration
at
once
brought
down
the
tower
which
overwhelmed
the
nave
demolishing
all
the
pillars
along
the
north
side
and
shattering
the
rest
the
very
parts
i
had
pointed
out
says
telford
were
those
which
gave
way
and
down
tumbled
the
tower
forming
a
very
remarkable
ruin
which
astonished
and
surprised
the
vestry
and
roused
them
from
their
infatuation
though
they
have
not
yet
recovered
from
the
shock
the
other
circumstance
to
which
we
have
above
referred
was
the
discovery
of
the
roman
city
of
uriconium
near
wroxeter
about
five
miles
from
shrewsbury
in
the
year
the
situation
of
the
place
is
extremely
beautiful
the
river
severn
flowing
along
its
western
margin
and
forming
a
barrier
against
what
were
once
the
hostile
districts
of
west
britain
for
many
centuries
the
dead
city
had
slept
under
the
irregular
mounds
of
earth
which
covered
it
like
those
of
mossul
and
nineveh
farmers
raised
heavy
crops
of
turnips
and
grain
from
the
surface
and
they
scarcely
ever
ploughed
or
harrowed
the
ground
without
turning
up
roman
coins
or
pieces
of
pottery
they
also
observed
that
in
certain
places
the
corn
was
more
apt
to
be
scorched
in
dry
weather
than
in
others
a
sure
sign
to
them
that
there
were
ruins
underneath
and
their
practice
when
they
wished
to
find
stones
for
building
was
to
set
a
mark
upon
the
scorched
places
when
the
corn
was
on
the
ground
and
after
harvest
to
dig
down
sure
of
finding
the
store
of
stones
which
they
wanted
for
walls
cottages
or
in
fact
the
place
came
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
quarry
rich
in
materials
for
building
purposes
a
quantity
of
stone
being
wanted
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
a
blacksmith
shop
on
digging
down
upon
one
of
the
marked
places
the
labourers
came
upon
some
ancient
works
of
a
more
perfect
appearance
than
usual
curiosity
was
excited
antiquarians
made
their
way
to
the
spot
and
lo
they
pronounced
the
ruins
to
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
roman
bath
in
a
remarkably
perfect
state
of
preservation
telford
was
requested
to
apply
to
pulteney
the
lord
of
the
manor
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
these
interesting
remains
and
also
to
permit
the
excavations
to
proceed
with
a
view
to
the
buildings
being
completely
explored
this
was
readily
granted
and
pulteney
authorised
telford
himself
to
conduct
the
necessary
excavations
at
his
expense
this
he
promptly
proceeded
to
do
and
the
result
was
that
an
extensive
hypocaust
apartment
was
brought
to
light
with
baths
sudatorium
and
a
number
of
tile
pillars
all
forming
parts
of
a
roman
floor
sufficiently
perfect
to
show
the
manner
in
which
the
building
had
been
constructed
and
used
among
telford
less
agreeable
duties
about
the
same
time
was
that
of
keeping
the
felons
at
work
he
had
to
devise
the
ways
and
means
of
employing
them
without
risk
of
their
escaping
which
gave
him
much
trouble
and
anxiety
really
he
said
my
felons
are
a
very
troublesome
family
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
plague
from
them
and
i
have
not
yet
got
things
quite
in
the
train
that
i
could
wish
i
have
had
a
dress
made
for
them
of
white
and
brown
cloth
in
such
a
way
that
they
are
they
have
each
a
light
chain
about
one
leg
their
allowance
in
food
is
a
penny
loaf
and
a
halfpenny
worth
of
cheese
for
breakfast
a
penny
loaf
a
quart
of
soup
and
half
a
pound
of
meat
for
dinner
and
a
penny
loaf
and
a
halfpenny
worth
of
cheese
for
supper
so
that
they
have
meat
and
clothes
at
all
events
i
employ
them
in
removing
earth
serving
masons
or
bricklayers
or
in
any
common
labouring
work
on
which
they
can
be
employed
during
which
time
of
course
i
have
them
strictly
watched
much
more
pleasant
was
his
first
sight
of
jordan
at
the
shrewsbury
theatre
where
he
seems
to
have
been
worked
up
to
a
pitch
of
rapturous
enjoyment
she
played
for
six
nights
there
at
the
race
time
during
which
there
were
various
entertainments
on
the
second
day
there
was
what
was
called
an
infirmary
meeting
or
an
assemblage
of
the
principal
county
gentlemen
in
the
infirmary
at
which
as
county
surveyor
telford
was
present
they
proceeded
thence
to
church
to
hear
a
sermon
preached
for
the
occasion
after
which
there
was
a
dinner
followed
by
a
concert
he
attended
all
the
sermon
was
preached
in
the
new
pulpit
which
had
just
been
finished
after
his
design
in
the
gothic
style
and
he
confidentially
informed
his
langholm
correspondent
that
he
believed
the
pulpit
secured
greater
admiration
than
the
sermon
with
the
concert
he
was
completely
disappointed
and
he
then
became
convinced
that
he
had
no
ear
for
music
other
people
seemed
very
much
pleased
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
make
nothing
of
it
the
only
difference
that
he
recognised
between
one
tune
and
another
was
that
there
was
a
difference
in
the
noise
it
was
all
very
fine
he
said
i
have
no
doubt
but
i
would
not
give
a
song
of
jock
stewart
for
the
whole
of
them
the
melody
of
sound
is
thrown
away
upon
me
one
look
one
word
of
jordan
has
more
effect
upon
me
than
all
the
fiddlers
in
england
yet
i
sat
down
and
tried
to
be
as
attentive
as
any
mortal
could
be
i
endeavoured
if
possible
to
get
up
an
interest
in
what
was
going
on
but
it
was
all
of
no
use
i
felt
no
emotion
whatever
excepting
only
a
strong
inclination
to
go
to
sleep
it
must
be
a
defect
but
it
is
a
fact
and
i
can
not
help
it
i
suppose
my
ignorance
of
the
subject
and
the
want
of
musical
experience
in
my
youth
may
be
the
cause
of
it
mother
was
still
living
in
her
old
cottage
at
the
crooks
since
he
had
parted
from
her
he
had
written
many
printed
letters
to
keep
her
informed
of
his
progress
and
he
never
wrote
to
any
of
his
friends
in
the
dale
without
including
some
message
or
other
to
his
mother
like
a
good
and
dutiful
son
he
had
taken
care
out
of
his
means
to
provide
for
her
comfort
in
her
declining
years
she
has
been
a
good
mother
to
me
he
said
and
i
will
try
and
be
a
good
son
to
her
in
a
letter
written
from
shrewsbury
about
this
time
enclosing
a
ten
pound
note
seven
pounds
of
which
were
to
be
given
to
his
mother
he
said
i
have
from
time
to
time
written
william
jackson
his
cousin
and
told
him
to
furnish
her
with
whatever
she
wants
to
make
her
comfortable
but
there
may
be
many
little
things
she
may
wish
to
have
and
yet
not
like
to
ask
him
for
you
will
therefore
agree
with
me
that
it
is
right
she
should
have
a
little
cash
to
dispose
of
in
her
own
way
i
am
not
rich
yet
but
it
will
ease
my
mind
to
set
my
mother
above
the
fear
of
want
that
has
always
been
my
first
object
and
next
to
that
to
be
the
somebody
which
you
have
always
encouraged
me
to
believe
i
might
aspire
to
become
perhaps
after
all
there
may
be
something
in
it
he
now
seems
to
have
occupied
much
of
his
leisure
hours
in
miscellaneous
reading
among
the
numerous
books
which
he
read
he
expressed
the
highest
admiration
for
sheridan
of
swift
but
his
langholm
friend
who
was
a
great
politician
having
invited
his
attention
to
politics
telford
reading
gradually
extended
in
that
direction
indeed
the
exciting
events
of
the
french
revolution
then
tended
to
make
all
men
more
or
less
politicians
the
capture
of
the
bastille
by
the
people
of
paris
in
passed
like
an
electric
thrill
through
europe
then
followed
the
declaration
of
rights
after
which
in
the
course
of
six
months
all
the
institutions
which
had
before
existed
in
france
were
swept
away
and
the
reign
of
justice
was
fairly
inaugurated
upon
earth
in
the
spring
of
the
first
part
of
paine
of
appeared
and
telford
like
many
others
read
it
and
was
at
once
carried
away
by
it
only
a
short
time
before
he
had
admitted
with
truth
that
he
knew
nothing
of
politics
but
no
sooner
had
he
read
paine
than
he
felt
completely
enlightened
he
now
suddenly
discovered
how
much
reason
he
and
everybody
else
in
england
had
for
being
miserable
while
residing
at
portsmouth
he
had
quoted
to
his
langholm
friend
the
lines
from
cowper
then
just
published
beginning
slaves
can
not
breathe
in
england
but
lo
paine
had
filled
his
imagination
with
the
idea
that
england
was
nothing
but
a
nation
of
bondmen
and
aristocrats
to
his
natural
mind
the
kingdom
had
appeared
to
be
one
in
which
a
man
had
pretty
fair
play
could
think
and
speak
and
do
the
thing
he
would
tolerably
happy
tolerably
prosperous
and
enjoying
many
blessings
he
himself
had
felt
free
to
labour
to
prosper
and
to
rise
from
manual
to
head
work
no
one
had
hindered
him
his
personal
liberty
had
never
been
interfered
with
and
he
had
freely
employed
his
earnings
as
he
thought
proper
but
now
the
whole
thing
appeared
a
delusion
those
old
country
gentlemen
who
came
riding
into
shrewsbury
to
quarter
sessions
and
were
so
fond
of
their
young
scotch
surveyor
occupying
themselves
in
building
bridges
maintaining
infirmaries
making
roads
and
regulating
gaols
those
county
magistrates
and
members
of
parliament
aristocrats
all
were
the
very
men
who
according
to
paine
were
carrying
the
country
headlong
to
ruin
if
telford
could
not
offer
an
opinion
on
politics
before
because
he
knew
nothing
about
them
he
had
now
no
such
difficulty
had
his
advice
been
asked
about
the
foundations
of
a
bridge
or
the
security
of
an
arch
he
would
have
read
and
studied
much
before
giving
it
he
would
have
carefully
inquired
into
the
chemical
qualities
of
different
kinds
of
lime
into
the
mechanical
principles
of
weight
and
resistance
and
such
like
but
he
had
no
such
hesitation
in
giving
an
opinion
about
the
foundations
of
a
constitution
of
more
than
a
thousand
years
growth
here
like
other
young
politicians
with
paine
book
before
him
he
felt
competent
to
pronounce
a
decisive
judgment
at
once
i
am
convinced
said
he
writing
to
his
langholm
friend
that
the
situation
of
great
britain
is
such
that
nothing
short
of
some
signal
revolution
can
prevent
her
from
sinking
into
bankruptcy
slavery
and
insignificancy
he
held
that
the
national
expenditure
was
so
enormous
arising
from
the
corrupt
administration
of
the
country
that
it
was
impossible
the
bloated
mass
could
hold
together
any
longer
and
as
he
could
not
expect
that
a
hundred
pulteneys
such
as
his
employer
could
be
found
to
restore
it
to
health
the
conclusion
he
arrived
at
was
that
ruin
was
inevitable
notwithstanding
the
theoretical
ruin
of
england
which
pressed
so
heavy
on
his
mind
at
this
time
we
find
telford
strongly
recommending
his
correspondent
to
send
any
good
wrights
he
could
find
in
his
neighbourhood
to
bath
where
they
would
be
enabled
to
earn
twenty
shillings
or
a
guinea
a
week
at
the
wages
paid
at
langholm
for
similar
work
being
only
about
half
those
amounts
in
the
same
letter
in
which
these
observations
occur
telford
alluded
to
the
disgraceful
riots
at
birmingham
in
the
course
of
which
priestley
house
and
library
were
destroyed
as
the
outrages
were
the
work
of
the
mob
telford
could
not
charge
the
aristocracy
with
them
but
with
equal
injustice
he
laid
the
blame
at
the
door
of
the
clergy
who
had
still
less
to
do
with
them
winding
up
with
the
prayer
may
the
lord
mend
their
hearts
and
lessen
their
incomes
fortunately
for
telford
his
intercourse
with
the
townspeople
of
shrewsbury
was
so
small
that
his
views
on
these
subjects
were
never
known
and
we
very
shortly
find
him
employed
by
the
clergy
themselves
in
building
for
them
a
new
church
in
the
town
of
bridgenorth
his
patron
and
employer
pulteney
however
knew
of
his
extreme
views
and
the
knowledge
came
to
him
quite
accidentally
he
found
that
telford
had
made
use
of
his
frank
to
send
through
the
post
a
copy
of
paine
of
man
to
his
langholm
correspondent
where
the
pamphlet
excited
as
much
fury
in
the
minds
of
some
of
the
people
of
that
town
as
it
had
done
in
that
of
telford
himself
the
langholm
patriots
broke
out
into
drinking
revolutionary
toasts
at
the
cross
and
so
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
little
town
that
some
of
them
were
confined
for
six
weeks
in
the
county
gaol
pulteney
was
very
indignant
at
the
liberty
telford
had
taken
with
his
frank
and
a
rupture
between
them
seemed
likely
to
ensue
but
the
former
was
forgiving
and
the
matter
went
no
further
it
is
only
right
to
add
that
as
telford
grew
older
and
wiser
he
became
more
careful
in
jumping
at
conclusions
on
political
topics
the
events
which
shortly
occurred
in
france
tended
in
a
great
measure
to
heal
his
mental
distresses
as
to
the
future
of
england
when
the
liberty
won
by
the
parisians
ran
into
riot
and
the
friends
of
man
occupied
themselves
in
taking
off
the
heads
of
those
who
differed
from
them
he
became
wonderfully
reconciled
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
substantial
freedom
which
after
all
was
secured
to
him
by
the
english
constitution
at
the
same
time
he
was
so
much
occupied
in
carrying
out
his
important
works
that
he
found
but
little
time
to
devote
either
to
political
speculation
or
to
versemaking
while
living
at
shrewsbury
he
had
his
poem
of
reprinted
for
private
circulation
we
have
also
seen
several
verses
by
him
written
about
the
same
period
which
do
not
appear
ever
to
have
been
printed
one
of
these
the
best
is
entitled
to
the
memory
of
james
thomson
author
of
liberty
a
poem
another
is
a
translation
from
buchanan
the
spheres
and
a
third
written
in
april
is
entitled
robin
burns
being
a
postscript
to
some
verses
addressed
to
him
on
the
establishment
of
an
agricultural
chair
in
edinburgh
it
would
unnecessarily
occupy
our
space
to
print
these
effusions
and
to
tell
the
truth
they
exhibit
few
if
any
indications
of
poetic
power
no
amount
of
perseverance
will
make
a
poet
of
a
man
in
whom
the
divine
gift
is
not
born

true
line
of
telford

lay

and
very
small
school
at
langholm
telford
did
not
neglect
to
send
him
a
copy
of
paine
of
man
and
as
he
was
totally
blind
he
employed
one
of
his
scholars
to
read
it
in
the
evenings
little
had
received
an
academical
education
before
he
lost
his
sight
and
aided
by
a
memory
of
uncommon
powers
he
taught
the
classics
and
particularly
greek
with
much
higher
reputation
than
any
other
schoolmaster
within
a
pretty
extensive
circuit
two
of

read

and
all
or
the
greater

of
sophocles
after
hearing
a
long
sentence
of
greek
or
latin
distinctly
recited
he
could
generally
construe
and
translate
it
with
little
or
no
hesitation
he
was
always
much
gratified
by
telford
visits
which
were
not
infrequent
to
his
native
district
chapter
telford
first
employment
as
an
engineer
as
surveyor
for
the
county
telford
was
frequently
called
upon
by
the
magistrates
to
advise
them
as
to
the
improvement
of
roads
and
the
building
or
repair
of
bridges
his
early
experience
of
in
his
native
district
now
proved
of
much
service
to
him
and
he
used
often
to
congratulate
himself
even
when
he
had
reached
the
highest
rank
in
his
profession
upon
the
circumstances
which
had
compelled
him
to
begin
his
career
by
working
with
his
own
hands
to
be
a
thorough
judge
of
work
he
held
that
a
man
must
himself
have
been
practically
engaged
in
it
not
only
he
said
are
the
natural
senses
of
seeing
and
feeling
requisite
in
the
examination
of
materials
but
also
the
practised
eye
and
the
hand
which
has
had
experience
of
the
kind
and
qualities
of
stone
of
lime
of
iron
of
timber
and
even
of
earth
and
of
the
effects
of
human
ingenuity
in
applying
and
combining
all
these
substances
are
necessary
for
arriving
at
mastery
in
the
profession
for
how
can
a
man
give
judicious
directions
unless
he
possesses
personal
knowledge
of
the
details
requisite
to
effect
his
ultimate
purpose
in
the
best
and
cheapest
manner
it
has
happened
to
me
more
than
once
when
taking
opportunities
of
being
useful
to
a
young
man
of
merit
that
i
have
experienced
opposition
in
taking
him
from
his
books
and
drawings
and
placing
a
mallet
chisel
or
trowel
in
his
hand
till
rendered
confident
by
the
solid
knowledge
which
experience
only
can
bestow
he
was
qualified
to
insist
on
the
due
performance
of
workmanship
and
to
judge
of
merit
in
the
lower
as
well
as
the
higher
departments
of
a
profession
in
which
no
kind
or
degree
of
practical
knowledge
is
superfluous
the
first
bridge
designed
and

under
telford
superintendence
was
one
of
no
great
magnitude
across
the
river
severn
at
montford
about
four
miles
west
of

it
was
a
stone
bridge
of
three
elliptical
arches
one
of
feet
and
two
of
feet
span
each
the
severn
at
that
point

deep

narrow

are
of
alluvial
earth
it
was
necessary
to
make
the
foundations
very
secure
as
the
river
is
subject
to
high
floods
and
this
was
effectuality
accomplished
by
means
of
the
building
was
substantially
executed
in
red
sandstone
and
proved
a
very
serviceable
bridge
forming
part
of
the
great
high
road
from
shrewsbury
into
wales
it
was
finished
in
the
year
in
the
same
year
we
find
telford
engaged
as
an
architect
in
preparing
the
designs
and
superintending
the
construction
of
the
new
parish
church
of
mary
magdalen
at
bridgenorth
it
stands
at
the
end
of
castle
street
near
to
the
old
ruined
fortress
perched
upon
the
bold
red
sandstone
bluff
on
which
the
upper
part
of
the
town
is
built
the
situation
of
the
church
is
very
fine
and
an
extensive
view
of
the
beautiful
vale
of
the
severn
is
obtained
from
it
telford
design
is
by
no
means
striking
being
as
he
said
a
regular
tuscan
elevation
the
inside
is
as
regularly
ionic
its
only
merit
is
simplicity
and
uniformity
it
is
surmounted
by
a
doric
tower
which
contains
the
bells
and
a
clock
a
graceful
gothic
church
would
have
been
more
appropriate
to
the
situation
and
a
much
finer
object
in
the
landscape
but
gothic
was
not
then
in
fashion
only
a
mongrel
mixture
of
many
styles
without
regard
to
either
purity
or
gracefulness
the
church
however
proved
comfortable
and
commodious
and
these
were
doubtless
the
points
to
which
the
architect
paid
most
attention
image
mary
magdalen
bridgenorth
his
completion
of
the
church
at
bridgenorth
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
inhabitants
brought
telford
a
commission
in
the
following
year
to
erect
a
similar
edifice
at
coalbrookdale
but
in
the
mean
time
to
enlarge
his
knowledge
and
increase
his
acquaintance
with
the
best
forms
of
architecture
he
determined
to
make
a
journey
to
london
and
through
some
of
the
principal
towns
of
the
south
of
england
he
accordingly
visited
gloucester
worcester
and
bath
remaining
several
days
in
the
city
he
was
charmed
beyond
expression
by
his
journey
through
the
manufacturing
districts
of
gloucestershire
more
particularly
by
the
fine
scenery
of
the
vale
of
stroud
the
whole
seemed
to
him
a
smiling
scene
of
prosperous
industry
and
comfort
but
passing
out
of
this
paradise
as
he
styled
it
another
stage
brought
him
into
a
region
the
very
opposite
we
stopped
says
he
at
a
little
alehouse
on
the
side
of
a
rough
hill
to
water
the
horses
and
lo
the
place
was
full
of
drunken
blackguards
bellowing
out
and
king
a
poor
ragged
german
jew
happened
to
come
up
whom
those
furious
loyalists
had
set
upon
and
accused
of
being
a
frenchman
in
disguise
he
protested
that
he
was
only
a
poor
german
who
de
corns
and
that
all
he
wanted
was
to
buy
a
little
bread
and
cheese
nothing
would
serve
them
but
they
must
carry
him
before
the
justice
the
great
brawny
fellow
of
a
landlord
swore
he
should
have
nothing
in
his
house
and
being
a
constable
told
him
that
he
would
carry
him
to
gaol
i
interfered
and
endeavoured
to
pacify
the
assailants
of
the
poor
man
when
suddenly
the
landlord
snatching
up
a
long
knife
sliced
off
about
a
pound
of
raw
bacon
from
a
ham
which
hung
overhead
and
presenting
it
to
the
jew
swore
that
if
he
did
not
swallow
it
down
at
once
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
go
the
man
was
in
a
worse
plight
than
ever
he
said
he
was
a
shoe
and
durst
not
eat
that
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
church
and
king
were
forgotten
and
eventually
i
prevailed
upon
the
landlord
to
accept
from
me
as
much
as
enabled
poor
little
moses
to
get
his
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
and
by
the
time
the
coach
started
they
all
seemed
perfectly
reconciled
telford
was
much
gratified
by
his
visit
to
bath
and
inspected
its
fine
buildings
with
admiration
but
he
thought
that
wood
who
he
says
created
modern
bath
had
left
no
worthy
successor
in
the
buildings
then
in
progress
he
saw
clumsy
designers
at
work
blundering
round
about
a
meaning
if
indeed
there
was
any
meaning
at
all
in
their
designs
which
he
confessed
he
failed
to
see
from
bath
he
went
to
london
by
coach
making
the
journey
in
safety
although
he
says
the
collectors
had
been
doing
duty
on
hounslow
heath
during
his
stay
in
london
he
carefully
examined
the
principal
public
buildings
by
the
light
of
the
experience
which
he
had
gained
since
he
last
saw
them
he
also
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
time
in
studying
rare
and
expensive
works
on
architecture
the
use
of
which
he
could
not
elsewhere
procure
at
the
libraries
of
the
antiquarian
society
and
the
british
museum
there
he
perused
the
various
editions
of
vitruvius
and
palladio
as
well
as
wren
he
found
a
rich
store
of
ancient
architectural
remains
in
the
british
museum
which
he
studied
with
great
care
antiquities
from
athens
baalbec
palmyra
and
herculaneum
so
that
he
says
what
with
the
information
i
was
before
possessed
of
and
that
which
i
have
now
accumulated
i
think
i
have
obtained
a
tolerably
good
general
notion
of
architecture
from
london
he
proceeded
to
oxford
where
he
carefully
inspected
its
colleges
and
churches
afterwards
expressing
the
great
delight
and
profit
which
he
had
derived
from
his
visit
he
was
entertained
while
there
by
robertson
an
eminent
mathematician
then
superintending
the
publication
of
an
edition
of
the
works
of
archimedes
the
architectural
designs
of
buildings
that
most
pleased
him
were
those
of
aldrich
dean
of
christchurch
about
the
time
of
sir
christopher
wren
he
tore
himself
from
oxford
with
great
regret
proceeding
by
birmingham
on
his
way
home
to
shrewsbury
birmingham
he
says
famous
for
its
buttons
and
locks
its
ignorance
and
barbarism
its
prosperity
increases
with
the
corruption
of
taste
and
morals
its
nicknacks
hardware
and
gilt
gimcracks
are
proofs
of
the
former
and
its
locks
and
bars
and
the
recent
barbarous
conduct
of
its
populace
are
evidences
of
the
latter
his
principal
object
in
visiting
the
place
was
to
call
upon
a
stained
respecting
a
window
for
the
new
church
at
bridgenorth
on
his
return
to
shrewsbury
telford
proposed
to
proceed
with
his
favourite
study
of
architecture
but
this
said
he
will
probably
be
very
slowly
as
i
must
attend
to
my
every
day
employment
namely
the
superintendence
of
the
county
road
and
bridge
repairs
and
the
direction
of
the
convicts
labour
if
i
keep
my
health
however
he
added
and
have
no
unforeseen
hindrance
it
shall
not
be
forgotten
but
will
be
creeping
on
by
degrees
an
unforeseen
circumstance
though
not
a
hindrance
did
very
shortly
occur
which
launched
telford
upon
a
new
career
for
which
his
unremitting
study
as
well
as
his
carefully
improved
experience
eminently
fitted
him
we
refer
to
his
appointment
as
engineer
to
the
ellesmere
canal
company
the
conscientious
carefulness
with
which
telford
performed
the
duties
entrusted
to
him
and
the
skill
with
which
he
directed
the
works
placed
under
his
charge
had
secured
the
general
approbation
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
county
his
straightforward
and
outspoken
manner
had
further
obtained
for
him
the
friendship
of
many
of
them
at
the
meetings
of
his
plans
had
often
to
encounter
considerable
opposition
and
when
called
upon
to
defend
them
he
did
so
with
such
firmness
persuasiveness
and
good
temper
that
he
usually
carried
his
point
some
of
the
magistrates
are
ignorant
he
wrote
in
and
some
are
obstinate
though
i
must
say
that
on
the
whole
there
is
a
very
respectable
bench
and
with
the
sensible
part
i
believe
i
am
on
good
terms
this
was
amply
proved
some
four
years
later
when
it
became
necessary
to
appoint
an
engineer
to
the
ellesmere
canal
on
which
occasion
the
magistrates
who
were
mainly
the
promoters
of
the
undertaking
almost
unanimously
solicited
their
surveyor
to
accept
the
office
indeed
telford
had
become
a
general
favourite
in
the
county
he
was
cheerful
and
cordial
in
his
manner
though
somewhat
brusque
though
now
years
old
he
had
not
lost
the
humorousness
which
had
procured
for
him
the
sobriquet
of
laughing
tam
he
laughed
at
his
own
jokes
as
well
as
at
others
he
was
spoken
of
as
jolly
a
word
then
much
more
rarely
as
well
as
more
choicely
used
than
it
is
now
yet
he
had
a
manly
spirit
and
was
very
jealous
of
his
independence
all
this
made
him
none
the
less
liked
by
men
speaking
of
the
friendly
support
which
he
had
throughout
received
from
pulteney
he
said
his
good
opinion
has
always
been
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
and
the
more
so
as
it
has
neither
been
obtained
nor
preserved
by
deceit
cringing
nor
flattery
on
the
contrary
i
believe
i
am
almost
the
only
man
that
speaks
out
fairly
to
him
and
who
contradicts
him
the
most
in
fact
between
us
we
sometimes
quarrel
like
tinkers
but
i
hold
my
ground
and
when
he
sees
i
am
right
he
quietly
gives
in
although
pulteney
influence
had
no
doubt
assisted
telford
in
obtaining
the
appointment
of
surveyor
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
unsolicited
invitation
which
now
emanated
from
the
county
gentlemen
telford
was
not
even
a
candidate
for
the
engineership
and
had
not
dreamt
of
offering
himself
so
that
the
proposal
came
upon
him
entirely
by
surprise
though
he
admitted
he
had
he
frankly
confessed
that
he
had
not
a
sufficient
amount
of
it
to
justify
him
in
aspiring
to
the
office
of
engineer
to
one
of
the
most
important
undertakings
of
the
day
the
following
is
his
own
account
of
the
circumstance
my
literary
is
at
present
at
a
stand
and
may
be
retarded
for
some
time
to
come
as
i
was
last
monday
appointed
sole
agent
architect
and
engineer
to
the
canal
which
is
projected
to
join
the
mersey
the
dee
and
the
severn
it
is
the
greatest
work
i
believe
now
in
hand
in
this
kingdom
and
will
not
be
completed
for
many
years
to
come
you
will
be
surprised
that
i
have
not
mentioned
this
to
you
before
but
the
fact
is
that
i
had
no
idea
of
any
such
appointment
until
an
application
was
made
to
me
by
some
of
the
leading
gentlemen
and
i
was
appointed
though
many
others
had
made
much
interest
for
the
place
this
will
be
a
great
and
laborious
undertaking
but
the
line
which
it
opens
is
vast
and
noble
and
coming
as
the
appointment
does
in
this
honourable
way
i
thought
it
too
great
a
opportunity
to
be
neglected
especially
as
i
have
stipulated
for
and
been
allowed
the
privilege
of
carrying
on
my
architectural
profession
the
work
will
require
great
labour
and
exertions
but
it
is
worthy
of
them
all
appointment
was
duly
confirmed
by
the
next
general
meeting
of
the
shareholders
of
the
ellesmere
canal
an
attempt
was
made
to
get
up
a
party
against
him
but
it
failed
i
am
fortunate
he
said
in
being
on
good
terms
with
most
of
the
leading
men
both
of
property
and
abilities
and
on
this
occasion
i
had
the
decided
support
of
the
great
john
wilkinson
king
of
the
ironmasters
himself
a
host
i
travelled
in
his
carriage
to
the
meeting
and
found
him
much
disposed
to
be
friendly
the
salary
at
which
telford
was
engaged
was
a
year
out
of
which
he
had
to
pay
one
clerk
and
one
confidential
foreman
besides
defraying
his
own
travelling
expenses
it
would
not
appear
that
after
making
these
disbursements
much
would
remain
for
telford
own
labour
but
in
those
days
engineers
were
satisfied
with
comparatively
small
pay
and
did
not
dream
of
making
large
fortunes
though
telford
intended
to
continue
his
architectural
business
he
decided
to
give
up
his
county
surveyorship
and
other
minor
matters
which
he
said
give
a
great
deal
of
very
unpleasant
labour
for
very
little
profit
in
short
they
are
like
the
calls
of
a
country
surgeon
one
part
of
his
former
business
which
he
did
not
give
up
was
what
related
to
the
affairs
of
pulteney
and
lady
bath
with
whom
he
continued
on
intimate
and
friendly
terms
he
incidentally
mentions
in
one
of
his
letters
a
graceful
and
charming
act
of
her
ladyship
on
going
into
his
room
one
day
he
found
that
before
setting
out
for
buxton
she
had
left
upon
his
table
a
copy
of
ferguson
republic
in
three
quarto
volumes
superbly
bound
and
gilt
he
now
looked
forward
with
anxiety
to
the
commencement
of
the
canal
the
execution
of
which
would
necessarily
call
for
great
exertion
on
his
part
as
well
as
unremitting
attention
and
industry
for
said
he
besides
the
actual
labour
which
necessarily
attends
so
extensive
a
public
work
there
are
contentions
jealousies
and
prejudices
stationed
like
gloomy
sentinels
from
one
extremity
of
the
line
to
the
other
but
as
i
have
heard
my
mother
say
that
an
honest
man
might
look
the
devil
in
the
face
without
being
afraid
so
we
must
just
trudge
along
in
the
old
way

the
ellesmere
canal
the
ellesmere
canal
consists
of
a
series
of
navigations
proceeding
from
the
river
dee
in
the
vale
of
llangollen
one
branch
passes
northward
near

of

towards

and

in
a
direction
by
the
town

canal
incorporated

it
being
about

of

canal
the
success
of
the
duke
of
bridgewater
canal
had
awakened
the
attention
of
the
landowners
throughout
england
but
more
especially
in
the
districts
immediately
adjacent
to
the
scene
of
the
operations
as
they
saw
with
their
own
eyes
the
extraordinary
benefits
which
had
followed
the
opening
up
of
the
navigations
the
resistance
of
the
landed
gentry
which
many
of
these
schemes
had
originally
to
encounter
had
now
completely
given
way
and
instead
of
opposing
canals
they
were
everywhere
found
anxious
for
their
construction
the
navigations
brought
lime
coal
manure
and
merchandise
almost
to
the
farmers
doors
and
provided
them
at
the
same
time
with
ready
means
of
conveyance
for
their
produce
to
good
markets
farms
in
remote
situations
were
thus
placed
more
on
an
equality
with
those
in
the
neighbourhood
of
large
towns
rents
rose
in
consequence
and
the
owners
of
land
everywhere
became
the
advocates
and
projectors
of
canals
the
dividends
paid
by
the
first
companies
were
very
high
and
it
was
well
known
that
the
duke
property
was
bringing
him
in
immense
wealth
there
was
therefore
no
difficulty
in
getting
the
shares
in
new
projects
readily
subscribed
for
indeed
telford
relates
that
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
ellesmere
projectors
so
eager
were
the
public
that
four
times
the
estimated
expense
was
subscribed
without
hesitation
yet
this
navigation
passed
through
a
difficult
country
necessarily
involving
very
costly
works
and
as
the
district
was
but
thinly
inhabited
it
did
not
present
a
very
inviting
prospect
of
dividends
but
the
mania
had
fairly
set
in
and
it
was
determined
that
the
canal
should
be
made
and
whether
the
investment
repaid
the
immediate
proprietors
or
not
it
unquestionably
proved
of
immense
advantage
to
the
population
of
the
districts
through
which
it
passed
and
contributed
to
enhance
the
value
of
most
of
the
adjoining
property

the
construction
of
the
canal
was
obtained
in
and
telford
commenced
operations
very
shortly
after
his
appointment
in
october
of
the
same
year
his
first
business
was
to
go
carefully
over
the
whole
of
the
proposed
line
and
make
a
careful
working
survey
settling
the
levels
of
the
different
lengths
and
the
position
of
the
locks
embankments
cuttings
and
aqueducts
in
all
matters
of
masonry
work
he
felt
himself
master
of
the
necessary
details
but
having
had
comparatively
small
experience
of
earthwork
and
none
of
he
determined
to
take
the
advice
of
william
jessop
on
that
part
of
the
subject
and
he
cordially
acknowledges
the
obligations
he
was
under
to
that
eminent
engineer
for
the
kind
assistance
which
he
received
from
him
on
many
occasions
the
heaviest
and
most
important
part
of
the
undertaking
was
in
carrying
the
canal
through
the
rugged
country
between
the
rivers
dee
and
ceriog
in
the
vale
of
llangollen
from
nantwich
to
whitchurch
the
distance
is
miles
and
the
rise
feet
involving
nineteen
locks
and
from
thence
to
ellesmere
chirk
and
the
river
dee
mile
above
llangollen
the
distance
is
miles
and
the
rise
feet
involving
only
two
locks
the
latter
part
of
the
undertaking
presented
the
greatest
difficulties
as
in
order
to
avoid
the
expense
of
constructing
numerous
locks
which
would
also
involve
serious
delay
and
heavy
expense
in
working
the
navigation
it
became
necessary
to
contrive
means
for
carrying
the
canal
on
the
same
level
from
one
side
of
the
respective
valleys
of
the
dee
and
the
ceriog
to
the
other
and
hence
the
magnificent
aqueducts
of
chirk
and
characterised
by
phillips
as
among
the
boldest
efforts
of
human
invention
in
modem
times
the
chirk
aqueduct
carries
the
canal
across
the
valley
of
the
ceriog
between
chirk
castle
and
the
village
of
that
name
at
this
point
the
valley
is
above
feet
wide
the
banks
are
steep
with
a
flat
alluvial
meadow
between
them
through
which
the
river
flows
the
country
is
finely
wooded
chirk
castle
stands
on
an
eminence
on
its
western
side
with
the
welsh
mountains
and
glen
ceriog
as
a
background
the
whole
composing
a
landscape
of
great
beauty
in
the
centre
of
which
telford
aqueduct
forms
a
highly
picturesque
object
image
chirk
aqueduct
the
aqueduct
consists
of
ten
arches
of
feet
span
each
the
level
of
the
water
in
the
canal
is
feet
above
the
meadow
and
feet
above
the
level
of
the
river
ceriog
the
proportions
of
this
work
far
exceeded
everything
of
the
kind
that
had
up
to
that
time
been
attempted
in
england
it
was
a
very
costly
structure
but
telford
like
brindley
thought
it
better
to
incur
a
considerable
capital
outlay
in
maintaining
the
uniform
level
of
the
canal
than
to
raise
and
lower
it
up
and
down
the
sides
of
the
valley
by
locks
at
a
heavy
expense
in
works
and
a
still
greater
cost
in
time
and
water
the
aqueduct
is
a
splendid
specimen
of
the
finest
class
of
masonry
and
telford
showed
himself
a
master
of
his
profession
by
the
manner
in
which
he
carried
out
the
whole
details
of
the
undertaking
the
piers
were
carried
up
solid
to
a
certain
height
above
which
they
were
built
hollow
with
cross
walls
the
spandrels
also
above
the
springing
of
the
arches
were
constructed
with
longitudinal
walls
and
left
hollow
the
first
stone
was
laid
on
the
of
june
and
the
work
was
completed
in
the
year
the
whole
remaining
in
a
perfect
state
to
this
day
the
other
great
aqueduct
on
the
ellesmere
canal
named
is
of
even
greater
dimensions
and
a
far
more
striking
object
in
the
landscape
sir
walter
scott
spoke
of
it
to
southey
as
the
most
impressive
work
of
art
he
had
ever
seen
it
is
situated
about
four
miles
to
the
north
of
chirk
at
the
crossing
of
the
dee
in
the
romantic
vale
of
llangollen
the
north
bank
of
the
river
is
very
abrupt
but
on
the
south
side
the
acclivity
is
more
gradual
the
lowest
part
of
the
valley
in
which
the
river
runs
is
feet
beneath
the
of
the
canal
and
it
became
a
question
with
the
engineer
whether
the
valley
was
to
be
crossed
as
originally
intended
by
locking
down
one
side
and
up
the
other
which
would
have
involved
seven
or
eight
locks
on
each
side
or
by
carrying
it
directly
across
by
means
of
an
aqueduct
the
execution
of
the
proposed
locks
would
have
been
very
costly
and
the
working
of
them
in
carrying
on
the
navigation
would
necessarily
have
involved
a
great
waste
of
water
which
was
a
serious
objection
inasmuch
as
the
supply
was
estimated
to
be
no
more
than
sufficient
to
provide
for
the
unavoidable
lockage
and
leakage
of
the
summit
level
hence
telford
was
strongly
in
favour
of
an
aqueduct
but
as
we
have
already
seen
in
the
case
of
that
at
chirk
the
height
of
the
work
was
such
as
to
render
it
impracticable
to
construct
it
in
the
usual
manner
upon
masonry
piers
and
arches
of
sufficient
breadth
and
strength
to
afford
room
for
a
puddled
which
would
have
been
extremely
hazardous
as
well
as
expensive
he
was
therefore
under
the
necessity
of
contriving
some
more
safe
and
economical
method
of
procedure
and
he
again
resorted
to
the
practice
which
he
had
adopted
in
the
construction
of
the
chirk
aqueduct
but
on
a
much
larger
scale
image
side
view
of
cast
iron
trough
it
will
be
understood
that
many
years
elapsed
between
the
period
at
which
telford
was
appointed
engineer
to
the
ellesmere
canal
and
the
designing
of
these
gigantic
works
he
had
in
the
meantime
been
carefully
gathering
experience
from
a
variety
of
similar
undertakings
on
which
he
was
employed
and
bringing
his
observations
of
the
strength
of
materials
and
the
different
forms
of
construction
to
bear
upon
the
plans
under
his
consideration
for
the
great
aqueducts
of
chirk
and
in
he
was
appointed
engineer
to
the
shrewsbury
canal
which
extends
from
that
town
to
the
collieries
and
ironworks
in
the
neighbourhood
of
wrekin
crossing
the
rivers
roden
and
tern
and
ketley
brook
after
which
it
joins
the
dorrington
and
shropshire
canals
writing
to
his
eskdale
friend
telford
said
although
this
canal
is
only
eighteen
miles
long
yet
there
are
many
important
works
in
its
course
several
locks
a
tunnel
about
half
a
mile
long
and
two
aqueducts
for
the
most
considerable
of
these
last
i
have
just
recommended
an
aqueduct
of
iron
it
has
been
approved
and
will
be
executed
under
my
direction
upon
a
principle
entirely
new
and
which
i
am
endeavouring
to
establish
with
regard
to
the
application
of
iron
it
was
the
same
principle
which
he
applied
to
the
great
aqueducts
of
the
ellesmere
canal
now
under
consideration
he
had
a
model
made
of
part
of
the
proposed
aqueduct
for
showing
the
piers
ribs
and
side
railing
with
a
cast
iron
trough
for
the
canal
the
model
being
approved
the
design
was
completed
the
ironwork
was
ordered
for
the
summit
and
the
masonry
of
the
piers
then
proceeded
the
was
laid
on
the
july
by
richard
myddelton
of
chirk
castle
and
the
work
was
not
finished
until
the
year
thus
occupying
a
period
of
nearly
eight
years
in
construction
the
aqueduct
is
approached
on
the
south
side
by
an
embankment
feet
in
length
extending
from
the
level
of
the
in
the
canal
until
its
perpendicular
height
at
the
tip
is
feet
thence
it
is
carried
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
over
the
river
dee
upon
piers
supporting
nineteen
arches
extending
to
the
length
of
feet
the
height
of
the
piers
above
low
water
in
the
river
is
feet
the
lower
part
of
each
was
built
solid
for
feet
all
above
being
hollow
for
the
purpose
of
saving
masonry
as
well
as
ensuring
good
workmanship
the
outer
walls
of
the
hollow
portion
are
only
two
feet
thick
with
cross
inner
walls
as
each
stone
was
exposed
to
inspection
and
as
both
telford
and
his
confidential
foreman
matthew
davidson
kept
a
vigilant
eye
upon
the
work
scamping
was
rendered
impossible
and
a
piece
of
masonry
was
the
result
image
aqueduct
upon
the
top
of
the
masonry
was
set
the
cast
iron
trough
for
the
canal
with
its
and
all
accurately
fitted
and
bolted
together
forming
a
completely
canal
with
a
of
feet
inches
of
which
the
standing
upon
iron
pillars
rising
from
the
bed
of
the
canal
occupied
feet
inches
leaving
a
space
of
feet
inches
for
the
boat
the
whole
cost
of
this
part
of
the
canal
was
which
was
considered
by
telford
a
moderate
sum
compared
with
what
it
must
have
cost
if
executed
after
the
ordinary
manner
the
aqueduct
was
formally
opened
for
traffic
in
and
thus
said
telford
has
been
added
a
striking
feature
to
the
beautiful
vale
of
llangollen
where
formerly
was
the
fastness
of
owen
glendower
but
which
now
cleared
of
its
entangled
woods
contains
a
useful
line
of
intercourse
between
england
and
ireland
and
the
water
drawn
from
the
once
sacred
devon
furnishes
the
means
of
distributing
prosperity
over
the
adjacent
land
of
the
saxons
image
section
of
top
of
aqueduct
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
refer
to
the
other
works
upon
this
canal
some
of
which
were
of
considerable
magnitude
though
they
may
now
seem
dwarfed
by
comparison
with
the
works
of
recent
engineers
thus
there
were
two
difficult
tunnels
cut
through
hard
rock
under
the
rugged
ground
which
separates
the
valleys
of
the
dee
and
the
ceriog
one
of
these
is
and
the
other
yards
in
length
to
ensure
a
supply
of
water
for
the
summit
of
the
canal
the
lake
called
bala
pool
was
dammed
up
by
a
regulating
weir
and
by
its
means
the
water
was
drawn
off
at
llandisilio
when
required
for
the
purposes
of
the
navigation
the
navigable
feeder
being
six
miles
long
carried
along
the
bank
of
the
llangollen
valley
all
these
works
were
skilfully
executed
and
when
the
undertaking
was
finished
telford
may
be
said
to
have
fairly
established
his
reputation
as
an
engineer
of
first
rate
ability
we
now
return
to
telford
personal
history
during
this
important
period
of
his
career
he
had
long
promised
himself
a
visit
to
his
dear
eskdale
and
the
many
friends
he
had
left
there
but
more
especially
to
see
his
infirm
mother
who
had
descended
far
into
the
vale
of
years
and
longed
to
see
her
son
once
more
before
she
died
he
had
taken
constant
care
that
she
should
want
for
nothing
she
formed
the
burden
of
many
of
his
letters
to
andrew
little
your
kindness
in
visiting
and
paying
so
much
attention
to
her
said
he
is
doing
me
the
greatest
favour
which
you
could
possibly
confer
upon
me
he
sent
his
friend
frequent
sums
of
money
which
he
requested
him
to
lay
out
in
providing
sundry
little
comforts
for
his
mother
who
seems
to
have
carried
her
spirit
of
independence
so
far
as
to
have
expressed
reluctance
to
accept
money
even
from
her
own
son
i
must
request
said
he
that
you
will
purchase
and
send
up
what
things
may
be
likely
to
be
wanted
either
for
her
or
the
person
who
may
be
with
her
as
her
habits
of
economy
will
prevent
her
from
getting
plenty
of
everything
especially
as
she
thinks
that
i
have
to
pay
for
it
which
really
hurts
me
more
than
anything
else
though
anxious
to
pay
his
intended
visit
he
was
so
occupied
with
one
urgent
matter
of
business
and
another
that
he
feared
it
would
be
november
before
he
could
set
out
he
had
to
prepare
a
general
statement
as
to
the
navigation
affairs
for
a
meeting
of
the
committee
he
must
attend
the
approaching
salop
quarter
sessions
and
after
that
a
general
meeting
of
the
canal
company
so
that
his
visit
must
be
postponed
for
yet
another
month
indeed
said
he
i
am
rather
distressed
at
the
thoughts
of
running
down
to
see
a
kind
parent
in
the
last
stage
of
decay
on
whom
i
can
only
bestow
an
affectionate
look
and
then
leave
her
her
mind
will
not
be
much
consoled
by
this
parting
and
the
impression
left
upon
mine
will
be
more
lasting
than
pleasant
he
did
however
contrive
to
run
down
to
eskdale
in
the
following
november
his
mother
was
alive
but
that
was
all
after
doing
what
he
could
for
her
comfort
and
providing
that
all
her
little
wants
were
properly
attended
to
he
hastened
back
to
his
responsible
duties
in
connection
with
the
ellesmere
canal
when
at
langholm
he
called
upon
his
former
friends
to
recount
with
them
the
incidents
of
their
youth
he
was
declared
to
be
the
same
canty
fellow
as
ever
and
though
he
had
risen
greatly
in
the
world
he
was
not
a
bit
set
up
he
found
one
of
his
old
fellow
workmen
frank
beattie
become
the
principal
innkeeper
of
the
place
what
have
you
made
of
your
mell
and
chisels
asked
telford
oh
replied
beattie
they
are
all
dispersed
perhaps
lost
i
have
taken
better
care
of
mine
said
telford
i
have
them
all
locked
up
in
a
room
at
shrewsbury
as
well
as
my
old
working
clothes
and
leather
apron
you
know
one
can
never
tell
what
may
happen
he
was
surprised
as
most
people
are
who
visit
the
scenes
of
their
youth
after
a
long
absence
to
see
into
what
small
dimensions
langholm
had
shrunk
that
high
street
which
before
had
seemed
so
big
and
that
frowning
gaol
and
in
the
market
place
were
now
comparatively
paltry
to
eyes
that
had
been
familiar
with
shrewsbury
portsmouth
and
london
but
he
was
charmed
as
ever
with
the
sight
of
the
heather
hills
and
the
narrow
winding
valley
where
deep
and
low
the
hamlets
lie
beneath
their
little
patch
of
sky
and
little
lot
of
stars
on
his
return
southward
he
was
again
delighted
by
the
sight
of
old
gilnockie
castle
and
the
surrounding
scenery
as
he
afterwards
wrote
to
his
friend
little
broomholm
was
in
all
his
glory
probably
one
of
the
results
of
this
visit
was
the
revision
of
the
poem
of
which
he
undertook
in
the
course
of
the
following
spring
putting
in
some
fresh
touches
and
adding
many
new
lines
whereby
the
effect
of
the
whole
was
considerably
improved
he
had
the
poem
printed
privately
merely
for
distribution
amongst
friends
being
careful
as
he
said
that
no
copies
should
be
smuggled
and
sold
later
in
the
year
we
find
him
on
his
way
to
london
on
business
sparing
a
day
or
two
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
the
duke
of
buckingham
palace
and
treasures
of
art
at
stowe
afterwards
writing
out
an
description
of
it
for
the
perusal
of
his
friends
at
langholm
at
another
time
when
engaged
upon
the
viaduct
at
he
snatched
a
few
day
leisure
to
run
through
north
wales
of
which
he
afterwards
gave
a
glowing
account
to
his
correspondent
he
passed
by
cader
idris
snowdon
and
penmaen
mawr
parts
of
the
country
we
passed
through
he
says
very
much
resemble
the
lofty
green
hills
and
woody
vales
of
eskdale
in
other
parts
the
magnificent
boldness
of
the
mountains
the
torrents
lakes
and
waterfalls
give
a
special
character
to
the
scenery
unlike
everything
of
the
kind
i
had
before
seen
the
vale
of
llanrwst
is
peculiarly
beautiful
and
fertile
in
this
vale
is
the
celebrated
bridge
of
inigo
jones
but
what
is
a
much
more
delightful
circumstance
the
inhabitants
of
the
vale
are
the
most
beautiful
race
of
people
i
have
ever
beheld
and
i
am
much
astonished
that
this
never
seems
to
have
struck
the
welsh
tourists
the
vale
of
llangollen
is
very
fine
and
not
the
least
interesting
object
in
it
i
can
assure
you
is
davidson
famous
aqueduct
which
is
already
reckoned
among
the
wonders
of
wales
your
old
acquaintance
thinks
nothing
of
having
three
or
four
carriages
at
his
door
at
a
time
it
seems
that
besides
attending
to
the
construction
of
the
works
telford
had
to

the
canal
affairs
he
says
in
one
of
his
letters
have
required
a
good
deal
of
exertion
though
we
are
on
the
whole
doing
well
but
besides
carrying
on
the
works
it
is
now
necessary
to
bestow
considerable
attention
on
the
creating
and
guiding
of
a
trade
upon
those
portions
which
are
executed
this
involves
various
considerations
and
many
contending
and
sometimes
clashing
interests
in
short
it
is
the
working
of
a
great
machine
in
the
first
place
to
draw
money
out
of
the
pockets
of
a
numerous
proprietary
to
make
an
expensive
canal
and
then
to
make
the
money
return
into
their
pockets
by
the
creation
of
a
business
upon
that
canal
but
as
if
all
this
business
were
not
enough
he
was
occupied
at
the
same
time
in
writing
a
book
upon
the
subject
of
mills
in
the
year
he
had
undertaken
to
draw
up
a
paper
on
this
topic
for
the
board
of
agriculture
and
by
degrees
it
had
grown
into
a
large
quarto
volume
illustrated
by
upwards
of
thirty
plates
he
was
also
reading
extensively
in
his
few
leisure
moments
and
among
the
solid
works
which
he
perused
we
find
him
mentioning
on
ancient
india
stewart
of
the
human
mind
and
alison
of
taste
as
a
relief
from
these
graver
studies
he
seems
above
all
things
to
have
taken
peculiar
pleasure
in
occasionally
throwing
off
a
bit
of
poetry
thus
when
laid
up
at
an
hotel
in
chester
by
a
blow
on
his
leg
which
disabled
him
for
some
weeks
he
employed
part
of
his
time
in
writing
his
on
hearing
of
the
death
of
robert
burns
on
another
occasion
when
on
his
way
to
london
and
detained
for
a
night
at
he
occupied
the
evening
at
his
inn
in
composing
some
stanzas
entitled
address
to
the
river
avon
and
when
on
his
way
back
to
shrewsbury
while
resting
for
the
night
at
bridgenorth
he
amused
himself
with
revising
and
copying
out
the
verses
for
the
perusal
of
andrew
little
there
are
worse
employments
he
said
when
one
has
an
hour
to
spare
from
business
and
he
asked
his
friend
opinion
of
the
composition
it
seems
to
have
been
no
more
favourable
than
the
verses
deserved
for
in
his
next
letter
telford
says
i
think
your
observation
respecting
the
verses
to
the
avon
are
correct
it
is
but
seldom
i
have
time
to
versify
but
it
is
to
me
something
like
what
a
fiddle
is
to
others
i
apply
to
it
in
order
to
relieve
my
mind
after
being
much
fatigued
with
close
attention
to
business
it
is
very
pleasant
to
see
the
engineer
relaxing
himself
in
this
way
and
submitting
cheerfully
to
unfavourable
criticism
which
is
so
trying
to
even
the
best
of
tempers
the
time
however
thus
taken
from
his
regular
work
was
not
loss
but
gain
taking
the
character
of
his
occupation
into
account
it
was
probably
the
best
kind
of
relaxation
he
could
have
indulged
in
with
his
head
full
of
bridges
and
viaducts
he
thus
kept
his
heart
open
to
the
influences
of
beauty
in
life
and
nature
and
at
all
events
the
writing
of
verses
indifferent
though
they
might
have
been
proved
of
this
value
to
him
that
it

the

of
this
original
contrivance
previously

and
in

to
obtain
sufficient
breadth
for

the
masonry
of
the

and
arches
was
of
massive
strength
and
after
all
this
expense
and
every
imaginable
precaution
the
frosts
by
swelling
the
moist
puddle
frequently
created
fissures
which
burst
the
masonry
and
suffered
the
water
to
escape
nay
sometimes
actually
threw
down
the
aqueducts
instances
of
this
kind
having
occurred
even
in
the
works
of
the
justly
celebrated
brindley
it
was
evident
that
the
increased
pressure
of
the
puddled
earth
was
the
chief
cause
of
such
failures
i
therefore
had
recourse
to
the
following
scheme
in
order
to
a
void
using
it
the
spandrels
of
the
stone
arches
were
constructed
with
longitudinal
walls
instead
of

at

these
bottom

had
flanches
on
their
edges

were
secured

the
merit
of
having

the
employment

in
our
opinion
without

reason

was
no

attention
was
naturally
directed
at
a
very
early
period
to
the
employment
of
cast
iron
in
the
strength
as
well
as

of
a

of

the
metal

be
moulded

such
precise
forms
and
so
accurately
fitted
together
as
to
give
to
the

the
greatest
possible
rigidity
while
it
defies
the
destructive
influences
of
time
and
atmospheric
corrosion
with
nearly
as
much
certainty
as
stone
itself
the
italians
and
french
who
took
the
lead
in
engineering
down
almost
to
the
end
of
last
century
early
detected
the
value
of
this
material
and
made
several
attempts
to
introduce
it
in
but
their
efforts
proved
unsuccessful
chiefly
because
of
the
inability
of
the
early
founders
to
cast
large
masses
of
iron
and
also
because
the
metal
was
then
more
expensive
than
either
stone
or
timber
the
first
actual
attempt
to
build
a
cast
iron
bridge
was
made
at
lyons
in
and
it
proceeded
so
far
that
one
of
the
arches
was
put
together
in
the
builder
yard
but
the
project
was
abandoned
as
too
costly
and
timber
was
eventually
used
it
was
reserved
for
english
manufacturers
to
triumph
over
the
difficulties
which
had
baffled
the
foreign
shortly
after
the
above
ineffectual
attempt
had
been
made
the
construction
of
a
bridge
over
the
severn
near
broseley
formed
the
subject
of
discussion
among
the
adjoining
owners
there
had
been
a
great
increase
in
the
coal
iron
brick
and
pottery
trades
of
the
neighbourhood
and
the
old
ferry
between
the
opposite
banks
of
the
river
was
found
altogether
inadequate
for
the
accommodation
of
the
traffic
the
necessity
for
a
bridge
had
long
been
felt
and
the
project
of
constructing
one
was
actively
taken
up
in
by
abraham
darby
the
principal
owner
of
the
extensive
iron
works
at
coalbrookdale
pritchard
a
shrewsbury
architect
prepared
the
design
of
a
stone
bridge
of
one
arch
in
which
he
proposed
to
introduce
a
of
cast
iron
occupying
only
a
few
feet
at
the
crown
of
the
arch
this
plan
was
however
given
up
as
unsuitable
and
another
with
the
entire
arch
of
cast
iron
was
designed
under
the
superintendence
of
darby
the
castings
were
made
in
the
works
at
coalbrookdale
and
the
bridge
was
erected
at
a
point
where
the
banks
were
of
considerable
height
on
both
sides
of
the
river
it
was
opened
for
traffic
in
and
continues
a
most
serviceable
structure
to
this
day
giving
the
name
to
the
town
of
ironbridge
which
has
sprung
up
in
its
immediate
vicinity
the
bridge
consists
of
one
semicircular
arch
of
feet
span
each
of
the
great
ribs
consisting
of
two
pieces
only
robert
stephenson
has
said
of
the
structure
if
we
consider
that
the
manipulation
of
cast
iron
was
then
completely
in
its
infancy
a
bridge
of
such
dimensions
was
doubtless
a
bold
as
well
as
an
original
undertaking
and
the
efficiency
of
the
details
is
worthy
of
the
boldness
of
the
conception

it
is
a
curious
circumstance
that
the
next
projector
of
an
iron
bridge
and
that
of
a
very
bold
design
was
the
celebrated
or
rather
the
notorious
tom

whose
political
writings
telford
had
so
much
admired
the
son
of

decent
quaker
of
thetford
who
trained
him
to
his
own
trade
of
a

paine
seems
early
to
have
contracted
a
dislike
for
the
sect
to
which
his
father
belonged
arrived
at
manhood
he
gave
up
staymaking
to
embrace
the
wild
life
of
a
privateersman
and
served
in
two
successive
adventures
leaving
the
sea
he
became
an
exciseman
but
retained
his
commission
for
only
a
year
then
he
became
an
usher
in
a
school
during
which
he
studied
mechanics
and
mathematics
again
appointed
an
exciseman
he
was
stationed
at
lewes
in
sussex
where
he
wrote
poetry
and
acquired
some
local
celebrity
as
a
writer
he
was
accordingly
selected
by
his
brother
excisemen
to
prepare
their
petition
to

for
an
increase
of

the
document
which
he
drew
up
procuring
him

the

offered
to
build
an

bridge
with
a

in
the
course
of
the

year
he
submitted
his
design
of
the
proposed
bridge
to
the
academy
of

at
paris
he
also
sent
a
copy
of
his
plan
to
sir
joseph
banks
for
submission
to
the
royal
society
and
encouraged
by
the
favourable
opinions
of
scientific
men
he
proceeded
to
rotherham
in
yorkshire
to
have
his
bridge
cast
an
american
gentleman
named
whiteside
having
advanced
money
to
paine
on
security
of
his
property
in
the
states
to
enable
the
bridge
to
be
completed
the
castings
were
duly
made
and
shipped
off
to
london
where
they
were
put
together
and
exhibited
to
the
public
on
a
at
paddington
the
bridge
was
there
visited
by
a
large
number
of
persons
and
was
considered
to
be
a
highly
creditable
work
suddenly
paine
attention
was
withdrawn
from
its
further
prosecution
by
the
publication
of
burke
celebrated
on
the
french
revolution
which
he
undertook
to
answer
whiteside
having
in
the
meantime
become
bankrupt
paine
was
arrested
by
his
assignees
but
was
liberated
by
the
assistance
of
two
other
americans
who
became
bound
for
him
paine
however
was
by
this
time
carried
away
by
the
fervour
of
the
french
revolution
having
become
a
member
of
the
national
convention
as
representative
for
calais
the

he
had
espoused
treated
him
scurvily
imprisoning
him
in

where
he
lay
for

months
escaped
to

we
find
him
in
presenting
to
the
american
congress
a
memoir
on
the
construction
of
iron
bridges
accompanied
by
several
models
it
does
not
appear
however
that
paine
ever
succeeded
in
erecting
an
iron
bridge
he
was
a
restless
speculative
unhappy
being
and
it
would
have
been
well
for
his
memory
if
instead
of
penning
shallow
infidelity
he
had
devoted
himself
to
his
original
idea
of
improving
the
communications
of
his
adopted
country
in
the
meantime
however
the
bridge
exhibited
at
paddington
had
produced
important
results
the
manufacturers
agreed
to
take
it
back
as
part
of
their
debt
and
the
materials
were
afterwards
used
in
the
construction
of
the
noble
bridge
over
the
wear
at
sunderland
which
was
erected
in

project
of
constructing

with
respect
to
the

we
should
probably
make
a
fair
division
of
the
honour
connected
with
this
unique
bridge
by
conceding
to
burdon
all
that
belongs
to
a
careful
elaboration

improvement

the

larger
span
than
had
been
made
before
his
time
or
of
the
important
examples
both
as
models
and
large
constructions
which
he
caused
to
be
made
and
publicly
exhibited
in
whatever
shares
the
merit
of
this
great
work
may
be
apportioned
it
must
be
admitted
to
be
one
of
the
earliest
and
greatest
triumphs
of
the
art
of
bridge
construction
its
span
exceeded
that
of
any
arch
then
known
being
feet
with
a
rise
of
feet
the
springing
commencing
at
feet
above
the
bed
of
the

its
height
was
such
as
to
allow
vessels
of
tons
burden
to
sail
underneath

striking
their
masts

characterised
the
bridge
as
a
structure

as
regards
its
proportions
and
the
small
quantity
of
material
employed
in
its
construction
will
probably
remain
unrivalled
image
wear
bridge
at
sunderland
the
same
year
in
which
burdon
bridge
was
erected
at
sunderland
telford
was
building
his
first
iron
bridge
over
the
severn
at
buildwas
at
a
point
about
midway
between
shrewsbury
and
bridgenorth
an
unusually
high
flood
having
swept
away
the
old
bridge
in
the
year
he
was
called
upon
as
surveyor
for
the
county
to
supply
the
plan
of
a
new
one
having
carefully
examined
the
bridge
at
coalbrookdale
and
appreciated
its
remarkable
merits
he
determined
to
build
the
proposed
bridge
at
buildwas
of
iron
and
as
the
waters
came
down
with
great
suddenness
from
the
welsh
mountains
he
further
resolved
to
construct
it
of
only
one
arch
so
as
to
afford
the
largest
possible
he
had
some
difficulty
in
inducing
the
coalbrookdale
who
undertook
the
casting
of
the
girders
to
depart
from
the
plan
of
the
earlier
structure
but
he
persisted
in
his
design
which
was
eventually
carried
out
it
consisted
of
a
single
arch
of
feet
span
the
segment
of
a
very
large
circle
calculated
to
resist
the
tendency
of
the
abutments
to
slide
inwards
which
had
been
a
defect
of
the
coalbrookdale
bridge
the
flat
arch
being
itself
sustained
and
strengthened
by
an
outer
ribbed
one
on
each
side
springing
lower
than
the
former
and
also
rising
higher
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
although
the
span
of
the
new
bridge
was
feet
wider
than
the
coalbrookdale
bridge
it
contained
less
than
half
the
quantity
of
iron
buildwas
bridge
containing
whereas
the
other
contained
tons
the
new
structure
was
besides
extremely
elegant
in
form
and
when
the
centres
were
struck
the
arch
and
abutments
stood
perfectly
firm
and
have
remained
so
to
this
day
but
the
ingenious
design
of
this
bridge
will
be
better
explained
by
the
following
representation
than
by
any
description
in
words
the
bridge
at
buildwas
however
was
not
first
employment
of
iron
in
for
the
year
before
its
erection
we
find
him
writing
to
his
friend
at
langholm
that
he
had
recommended
an
iron
aqueduct
for
the
shrewsbury
canal
on
a
principle
entirely
new
and
which
he
was
endeavouring
to
establish
with
regard
to
the
application
of
iron
this
iron
aqueduct
had
been
cast
and
fixed
and
it
was
found
to
effect
so
great
a
saving
in
masonry
and
earthwork
that
he
was
afterwards
induced
to
apply
the
same
principle
as
we
have
already
seen
in
different
forms
in
the
magnificent
aqueducts
of
chirk
and
the
uses
of
cast
iron
in
canal
construction
became
more
obvious
with
every
year
successive
experience
and
telford
was
accustomed
to
introduce
it
in
many
cases
where
formerly
only
timber
or
stone
had
been
used
on
the
ellesmere
and
afterwards
on
the
caledonial
canal
he
adopted
cast
iron
which
were
found
to
answer
well
being
more
durable
than
timber
and
not
liable
like
it
to
shrink
and
expand
with
alternate
dryness
and
wet
the
turnbridges
which
he
applied
to
his
canals
in
place
of
the
old
drawbridges
were
also
of
cast
iron
and
in
some
cases
even
the
locks
were
of
the
same
material
thus
on
a
part
of
the
ellesmere
canal
opposite
beeston
castle
in
cheshire
where
a
couple
of
locks
together
rising
feet
having
been
built
on
a
stratum
of
quicksand
were
repeatedly
undermined
the
idea
of
constructing
the
entire
locks
of
cast
iron
was
suggested
and
this
unusual
application
of
the
new
material
was
accomplished
with
entirely
satisfactory
results
but
telford
principal
employment
of
cast
iron
was
in
the
construction
of
road
bridges
in
which
he
proved
himself
a
master
his
experience
in
these
structures
had
become
very
extensive
during
the
time
that
he
held
the
office
of
surveyor
to
the
county
of
salop
he
erected
no
fewer
than
five
of
which
were
of
iron
indeed
his
success
in
iron
so
much
emboldened
him
that
in
when
old
london
bridge
had
become
so
rickety
and
inconvenient
that
it
was
found
necessary
to
take
steps
to
rebuild
or
remove
it
he
proposed
the
daring
plan
of
a
cast
iron
bridge
of
a
single
arch
of
not
less
than
feet
span
the
segment
of
a
circle
feet
in
diameter
in
preparing
this
design
we
find
that
he
was
associated
with
a
douglas
to
whom
many
allusions
are
made
in
his
private
letters
the
design
of
this
bridge
seems
to
have
arisen
out
of
a
larger
project
for
the
improvement
of
the
port
of
london
in
a
private
letter
of
telford
dated
the
may
he
says
i
have
twice
attended
the
select
committee
on
the
fort
of
london
lord
hawkesbury
chairman
the
subject
has
now
been
agitated
for
four
years
and
might
have
been
so
for
many
more
if
pitt
had
not
taken
the
business
out
of
the
hands
of
the
general
committee
and
got
it
referred
to
a
select
committee
last
year
they
recommended
that
a
system
of
docks
should
be
formed
in
a
large
bend
of
the
river
opposite
greenwich
called
the
isle
of
dogs
with
a
canal
across
the
neck
of
the
bend
this
part
of
the
contemplated
improvements
is
already
commenced
and
is
proceeding
as
rapidly
as
the
nature
of
the
work
will
admit
it
will
contain
ship
docks
for
large
vessels
such
as
east
and
west
indiamen
whose
draught
of
water
is
considerable
there
are
now
two
other
propositions
under
consideration
one
is
to
form
another
system
of
docks
at
wapping
and
the
other
to
take
down
london
bridge
rebuild
it
of
such
dimensions
as
to
admit
of
ships
of
tons
passing
under
it
and
form
a
new
pool
for
ships
of
such
burden
between
london
and
blackfriars
bridges
with
a
set
of
regular
wharves
on
each
side
of
the
river
this
is
with
the
view
of
saving
lighterage
and
plunderage
and
bringing
the
great
mass
of
commerce
so
much
nearer
to
the
heart
of
the
city
this
last
part
of
the
plan
has
been
taken
up
in
a
great
measure
from
some
statements
i
made
while
in
london
last
year
and
i
have
been
called
before
the
committee
to
explain
i
had
previously
prepared
a
set
of
plans
and
estimates
for
the
purpose
of
showing
how
the
idea
might
be
carried
out
and
thus
a
considerable
degree
of
interest
has
been
excited
on
the
subject
it
is
as
yet
however
very
uncertain
how
far
the
plans
will
be
carried
out
it
is
certainly
a
matter
of
great
national
importance
to
render
the
port
of
london
as
perfect
as
possible
later
in
the
same
year
he
writes
that
his
plans
and
propositions
have
been
approved
and
recommended
to
be
carried
out
and
he
expects
to
have
the
execution
of
them
if
they
will
provide
the
ways
and
means
says
he
and
give
me
i
see
my
way
as
plainly
as
mending
the
brig
at
the
auld
burn
in
november
he
states
that
his
view
of
london
bridge
as
proposed
by
him
has
been
published
and
much
admired
on
the
of
april
he
writes
i
have
got
into
mighty
favour
with
the
royal
folks
i
have
received
notes
written
by
order
of
the
king
the
prince
of
wales
duke
of
york
and
duke
of
kent
about
the
bridge
print
and
in
future
it
is
to
be
dedicated
to
the
king
the
bridge
in
question
was
one
of
the
boldest
of
telford
designs
he
proposed
by
his
one
arch
to
provide
a
clear
headway
of
feet
above
high
water
the
arch
was
to
consist
of
seven
cast
iron
ribs
in
segments
as
large
as
possible
and
they
were
to
be
connected
by
diagonal
disposed
in
such
a
manner
that
any
part
of
the
ribs
and
braces
could
be
taken
out
and
replaced
without
injury
to
the
stability
of
the
bridge
or
interruption
to
the
traffic
over
it
the
roadway
was
to
be
feet
wide
at
the
abutments
and
feet
in
the
centre
the
width
of
the
arch
being
gradually
contracted
towards
the
crown
in
order
to
lighten
the
weight
of
the
structure
the
bridge
was
to
contain
tons
of
iron
and
the
cost
of
the
whole
was
to
be
image
telford
proposed
bridge
over
the
thames
the
originality
of
the
design
was
greatly
admired
though
there
were
many
who
received
with
incredulity
the
proposal
to
bridge
the
thames
by
a
single
arch
and
it
was
sarcastically
said
of
telford
that
he
might
as
well
think
of
setting
the
thames
on
fire
before
any
outlay
was
incurred
in
building
the
bridge
the
design
was
submitted
to
the
consideration
of
the
most
eminent
scientific
and
practical
men
of
the
day
after
which
evidence
was
taken
at
great
length
before
a
select
committee
which
sat
on
the
subject
among
those
examined
on
the
occasion
were
the
venerable
james
watt
of
birmingham
john
rennie
professor
button
of
woolwich
professors
playfair
and
robison
of
edinburgh
jessop
and
maskelyne
their
evidence
will
still
be
found
interesting
as
indicating
the
state
at
which
constructive
science
had
at
that
time
arrived
in
england
there
was
a
considerable
diversity
of
opinion
among
the
witnesses
as
might
have
been
expected
for
experience
was
as
yet
very
limited
as
to
the
resistance
of
cast
iron
to
extension
and
compression
some
of
them
anticipated
immense
difficulty
in
casting
pieces
of
metal
of
the
necessary
size
and
exactness
so
as
to
secure
that
the
radiated
joints
should
be
all
straight
and
bearing
others
laid
down
certain
ingenious
theories
of
the
arch
which
did
not
quite
square
with
the
plan
proposed
by
the
engineer
but
as
was
candidly
observed
by
professor
playfair
in
concluding
his
report
it
is
not
from
theoretical
men
that
the
most
valuable
information
in
such
a
case
as
the
present
is
to
be
expected
when
a
mechanical
arrangement
becomes
in
a
certain
degree
complicated
it
baffles
the
efforts
of
the
geometer
and
refuses
to
submit
to
even
the
most
approved
methods
of
investigation
this
holds
good
particularly
of
bridges
where
the
principles
of
mechanics
aided
by
all
the
resources
of
the
higher
geometry
have
not
yet
gone
further
than
to
determine
the
equilibrium
of
a
set
of
smooth
wedges
acting
on
one
another
by
pressure
only
and
in
such
circumstances
as
except
in
a
philosophical
experiment
can
hardly
ever
be
realised
it
is
therefore
from
men
educated
in
the
school
of
daily
practice
and
experience
and
who
to
a
knowledge
of
general
principles
have
added
from
the
habits
of
their
profession
a
certain
feeling
of
the
justness
or
insufficiency
of
any
mechanical
contrivance
that
the
soundest
opinions
on
a
matter
of
this
kind
can
be
obtained
it
would
appear
that
the
committee
came
to
the
general
conclusion
that
the
construction
of
the
proposed
bridge
was
practicable
and
safe
for
the
river
was
contracted
to
the
requisite
width
and
the
preliminary
works
were
actually
begun
stephenson
says
the
design
was
eventually
abandoned
owing
more
immediately
to
the
difficulty
of
constructing
the
approaches
with
such
a
head
way
which
would
have
involved
the
formation
of
extensive
inclined
planes
from
the
adjoining
streets
and
thereby
led
to
serious
inconvenience
and
the
depreciation
of
much
valuable
property

both
sides
of

fell
back
upon
his
ordinary

as
an
architect

in
the
course
of
which
he
designed
and
erected
several
stone
bridges
of
considerable
magnitude
and
importance
in
the
spring
of
after
a
long
continued
fall
of
snow
a
sudden
thaw
raised
a
heavy
flood
in
the
severn
which
carried
away
many
bridges
amongst
others

at
bewdley
in

telford
was

to

was

i
struck
the

it
was

considerably
greater

than
had
been
the

of
feet
span
the
rise
being
considerable
high
wingwalls
and
deep
spandrels

requisite
but
the
weight
of
the
structure
was
much
lightened
by
the
expedient
which
he
adopted
of
perforating
the
wings
and
building
a
number
of
longitudinal
walls
in
the
spandrels
instead
of
filling
them
with
earth

great

as
lightness

life
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
it
suits
my
disposition
another
work
on
which
telford
was
engaged
at
this
time
was
a
project
for
supplying
the
town
of
liverpool
with
water
conveyed
through
pipes
in
the
same
manner
as
had
long
before
been
adopted
in
london
he
was
much
struck
by
the
activity
and
enterprise
apparent
in
liverpool
compared
with
bristol
liverpool
he
said
has
taken
firm
root
in
the
country
by
means
of
the
canals
it
is
young
vigorous
and
well
situated
bristol
is
sinking
in
commercial
importance
its
merchants
are
rich
and
indolent
and
in
their
projects
they
are
always
too
late
besides
the
place
is
badly
situated
there
will
probably
arise
another
port
there
somewhat
nearer
the
severn
but
liverpool
will
nevertheless
continue
of
the
first
commercial
importance
and
their
water
will
be
turned
into
wine
we
are
making
rapid
progress
in
this
country
i
mean
from
liverpool
to
bristol
and
from
wales
to
birmingham
this
is
an
extensive
and
rich
district
abounding
in
coal
lime
iron
and
lead
agriculture
too
is
improving
and
manufactures
are
advancing
at
rapid
strides
towards
perfection
think
of
such
a
mass
of
population
industrious
intelligent
and
energetic
in
continual
exertion
in
short
i
do
not
believe
that
any
part
of
the
world
of
like
dimensions
ever
exceeded
great
britain
as
it
now
is
in
regard
to
the
production
of
wealth
and
the
practice
of
the
useful
arts
amidst
all
this
progress
which
so
strikingly
characterized
the
western
districts
of
england
telford
also
thought
that
there
was
a
prospect
of
coming
improvement
for
ireland
there
is
a
board
of
five
members
appointed
by
parliament
to
act
as
a
board
of
control
over
all
the
inland
navigations
of
ireland
one
of
the
members
is
a
particular
friend
of
mine
and
at
this
moment
a
pupil
as
it
were
anxious
for
information
this
is
a
noble
object
the
field
is
wide
the
ground
new
and
capable
of
vast
improvement
to
take
up
and
manage
the
water
of
a
fine
island
is
like
a
fairy
tale
and
if
properly
conducted
it
would
render
ireland
truly
a
jewel
among
the
nations
it
does
not
however
appear
that
telford
was
ever
employed
by
the
board
to
carry
out
the
grand
scheme
which
thus
fired
his
engineering
imagination
mixing
freely
with
men
of
all
classes
our
engineer
seems
to
have
made
many
new
friends
and
acquaintances
about
this
time
while
on
his
journeys
north
and
south
he
frequently
took
the
opportunity
of
looking
in
upon
the
venerable
james
watt
a
great
and
good
man
he
terms
him
at
his
house
at
heathfield
near
birmingham
at
london
he
says
he
is
often
with
old
brodie
and
black
each
the
first
in
his
profession
though
they
walked
up
together
to
the
great
city
on
foot
more
than
half
a
century
ago
gloria
about
the
same
time
we
find
him
taking
interest
in
the
projects
of
a
deserving
person
named
holwell
a
in
staffordshire
and
assisting
him
to
take
out
a
patent
for
boring
wooden
pipes
he
being
a
person
says
telford
little
known
and
not
having
capital
interest
or
connections
to
bring
the
matter
forward
telford
also
kept
up
his
literary
friendships
and
preserved
his
love
for
poetical
reading
at
shrewsbury
one
of
his
most
intimate
friends
was
darwin
son
of
the
author
of
the
garden
at
liverpool
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
currie
and
was
favoured
with
a
sight
of
his
manuscript
of
the
life
of
burns
then
in
course
of
publication
curiously
enough
currie
had
found
among
burns
papers
a
copy
of
some
verses
addressed
to
the
poet
which
telford
recognised
as
his
own
written
many
years
before
while
working
as
a
mason
at
langholm
their
purport
was
to
urge
burns
to
devote
himself
to
the
composition
of
poems
of
a
serious
character
such
as
the
saturday
night
with
telford
permission
several
extracts
from
his
address
to
burns
were
published
in
in
currie
life
of
the
poet
another
of
his
literary
friendships
formed
about
the
same
time
was
that
with
thomas
campbell
then
a
very
young
man
whose
of
had
just
made
its
appearance
telford
in
one
of
his
letters
says
i
will
not
leave
a
stone
unturned
to
try
to
serve
the
author
of
that
charming
poem
in
a
subsequent
he
says
the
author
of
the
of
hope
has
been
here
for
some
time
i
am
quite
delighted
with
him
he
is
the
very
spirit
of
poetry
on
monday
i
introduced
him
to
the
king
librarian
and
i
imagine
some
good
may
result
to
him
from
the
introduction
in
the
midst
of
his
plans
of
docks
canals
and
bridges
he
wrote
letters
to
his
friends
about
the
peculiarities
of
goethe
poems
and
kotzebue
plays
roman
antiquities
buonaparte
campaign
in
egypt
and
the
merits
of
the
last
new
book
he
confessed
however
that
his
leisure
for
reading
was
rapidly
diminishing
in
consequence
of
the
increasing
professional
demands
upon
his
time
but
he
bought
the
britannica
which
he
described
as
a
perfect
treasure
containing
everything
and
always
at
hand
he
thus
rapidly
described
the
manner
in
which
his
time
was
engrossed
a
few
days
since
i
attended
a
general
assembly
of
the
canal
proprietors
in
shropshire
i
have
to
be
at
chester
again
in
a
week
upon
an
arbitration
business
respecting
the
rebuilding
of
the
county
hall
and
gaol
but
previous
to
that
i
must
visit
liverpool
and
afterwards
proceed
into
worcestershire
so
you
see
what
sort
of
a
life
i
have
of
it
it
is
something
like
buonaparte
when
in
italy
fighting
battles
at
fifty
or
a
hundred
miles
distance
every
other
day
however
plenty
of
employment
is
what
every
professional
man
is
seeking
after
and
my
various
occupations
now
require
of
me
great
exertions
which
they
certainly
shall
have
so
long
as
life
and
health
are
spared
to
me
amidst
all
his
engagements
telford
found
time
to
make
particular
inquiry
about
many
poor
families
formerly
known
to
him
in
eskdale
for
some
of
whom
he
paid
while
he
transmitted
the
means
of
supplying
others
with
coals
meal
and
necessaries
during
the
severe
winter
months
a
practice
which
he
continued

of

chapter

highland
roads
and
bridges
in
an
early
chapter
of
this
volume
we
have
given
a
rapid
survey
of
the
state
of
scotland
about
the
middle
of
last
century
we
found
a
country
without
roads
fields
lying
uncultivated
mines
unexplored
and
all
branches
of
industry
languishing
in
the
midst
of
an
idle
miserable
and
haggard
population
fifty
years
passed
and
the
state
of
the
lowlands
had
become
completely
changed
roads
had
been
made
canals
dug
opened
up
ironworks
established
manufactures
were
extending
in
all
directions
and
scotch
agriculture
instead
of
being
the
worst
was
admitted
to
be
the
best
in
the
island
i
have
been
perfectly
astonished
wrote
romilly
from
stirling
in
at
the
richness
and
high
cultivation
of
all
the
tract
of
this
calumniated
country
through
which
i
have
passed
and
which
extends
quite
from
edinburgh
to
the
mountains
where
i
now
am
it
is
true
however
that
almost
everything
which
one
sees
to
admire
in
the
way
of
cultivation
is
due
to
modem
improvements
and
now
and
then
one
observes
a
few
acres
of
brown
moss
contrasting
admirably
with
the
to
which
they
are
contiguous
and
affording
a
specimen
of
the
dreariness
and
desolation
which
only
half
a
century
ago
overspread
a
country
now
highly
cultivated
and
become
a
most
copious
source
of
human
happiness
it
must
however
be
admitted
that
the
industrial
progress
thus
described
was
confined
almost
entirely
to
the
lowlands
and
had
scarcely
penetrated
the
mountainous
regions
lying
towards
the
the
rugged
nature
of
that
part
of
the
country
interposed
a
formidable
barrier
to
improvement
and
the
district
still
remained
very
imperfectly
opened
up
the
only
practicable
roads
were
those
which
had
been
made
by
the
soldiery
after
the
rebellions
of
and
through
counties
which
before
had
been
inaccessible
except
by
dangerous
footpaths
across
high
and
rugged
mountains
an
old
epigram
in
vogue
at
the
end
of
last
century
ran
thus
had
you
seen
these
roads
before
they
were
made
you
lift
up
your
hands
and
bless
general
wade
being
constructed
by
soldiers
for
military
purposes
they
were
first
known
as
military
roads
one
was
formed
along
the
great
glen
of
scotland
in
the
line
of
the
present
caledonian
canal
connected
with
the
lowlands
by
the
road
through
glencoe
by
tyndrum
down
the
western
banks
of
loch
lomond
another
more
northerly
connected
fort
augustus
with
dunkeld
by
blair
athol
while
a
third
still
further
to
the
north
and
east
connected
fort
george
with
by
badenoch
and
braemar
the
military
roads
were
about
eight
hundred
miles
in
extent
and
maintained
at
the
public
expense
but
they
were
laid
out
for
purposes
of
military
occupation
rather
than
for
the
convenience
of
the
districts
which
they
traversed
hence
they
were
comparatively
little
used
and
the
highlanders
in
passing
from
one
place
to
another
for
the
most
part
continued
to
travel
by
the
old
cattle
tracks
along
the
mountains
but
the
population
were
as
yet
so
poor
and
so
spiritless
and
industry
was
in
so
backward
a
state
all
over
the
highlands
that
the
want
of
more
convenient
communications
was
scarcely
felt
though
there
was
plenty
of
good
timber
in
certain
districts
the
bark
was
the
only
part
that
could
be
sent
to
market
on
the
backs
of
ponies
while
the
timber
itself
was
left
to
rot
upon
the
ground
agriculture
was
in
a
surprisingly
backward
state
in
the
remoter
districts
only
a
little
oats
or
barley
was
grown
the
chief
part
of
which
was
required
for
the
sustenance
of
the
cattle
during
winter
the
rev
macdougall
minister
of
the
parishes
of
lochgoilhead
and
kilmorich
in
argyleshire
described
the
people
of
that
part
of
the
country
about
the
year
as
miserable
beyond
description
he
says
indolence
was
almost
the
only
comfort
they
enjoyed
there
was
scarcely
any
variety
of
wretchedness
with
which
they
were
not
obliged
to
struggle
or
rather
to
which
they
were
not
obliged
to
submit
they
often
felt
what
it
was
to
want
food
to
such
an
extremity
were
they
frequently
reduced
that
they
were
obliged
to
bleed
their
cattle
in
order
to
subsist
some
time
on
the
blood
boiled
and
even
the
inhabitants
of
the
glens
and
valleys
repaired
in
crowds
to
the
shore
at
the
distance
of
three
or
four
miles
to
pick
up
the
scanty
provision
which
the
afforded
them
the
plough
had
not
yet
penetrated
into
the
highlands
an
instrument
called
the
image
the
literally
the
crooked
foot
the
use
of
which
had
been
forgotten
for
hundreds
of
years
in
every
other
country
in
europe
was
almost
the
only
tool
employed
in
tillage
in
those
parts
of
the
highlands
which
were
separated
by
almost
impassable
mountains
from
the
rest
of
the
united
kingdom
the
native
population
were
by
necessity
peaceful
old
feuds
were
restrained
by
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
if
indeed
the
spirit
of
the
clans
had
not
been
completely
broken
by
the
severe
repressive
measures
which
followed
the
rebellion
of
but
the
people
had
hot
yet
learnt
to
bend
their
backs
like
the
sassenach
to
the
stubborn
soil
and
they
sat
gloomily
by
their
at
home
or
wandered
away
to
settle
in
other
lands
beyond
the
seas
it
even
began
to
be
feared
that
the
country
would
so
on
be
entirely
depopulated
and
it
became
a
matter
of
national
concern
to
devise
methods
of
opening
up
the
district
so
as
to
develope
its
industry
and
afford
improved
means
of
sustenance
for
its
population
the
poverty
of
the
inhabitants
rendered
the
attempt
to
construct
roads
even
had
they
desired
them
beyond
their
scanty
means
but
the
ministry
of
the
day
entertained
the
opinion
that
by
contributing
a
certain
proportion
of
the
necessary
expense
the
proprietors
of
highland
estates
might
be
induced
to
advance
the
remainder
and
on
this
principle
the
construction
of
the
new
roads
in
those
districts
was
undertaken
the
country
lying
to
the
west
of
the
great
glen
was
absolutely
without
a
road
of
any
kind
the
only
district
through
which
travellers
passed
was
that
penetrated
by
the
great
highland
road
by
badenoch
between
perth
and
inverness
and
for
a
considerable
time
after
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
of
it
was
infested
by
gangs
of
desperate
robbers
so
unsafe
was
the
route
across
the
grampians
that
persons
who
had
occasion
to
travel
it
usually
made
their
wills
before
setting
out
garrons
or
little
highland
ponies
were
then
used
by
the
gentry
as
well
as
the
peasantry
inns
were
few
and
bad
and
even
when
postchaises
were
introduced
at
inverness
the
expense
of
hiring
one
was
thought
of
for
weeks
perhaps
months
and
arrangements
were
usually
made
for
sharing
it
among
as
many
individuals
as
it
would
contain
if
the
harness
and
springs
of
the
vehicle
held
together
travellers
thought
themselves
fortunate
in
reaching
edinburgh
jaded
and
weary
but
safe
in
purse
and
limb
on
the
eighth
day
after
leaving
inverness
very
few
persons
then
travelled
into
the
highlands
on
foot
though
bewick
the
father
of
made
such
a
journey
round
loch
lomond
in
he
relates
that
his
appearance
excited
the
greatest
interest
at
the
highland
huts
in
which
he
lodged
the
women
curiously
examining
him
from
head
to
foot
having
never
seen
an
englishman
before
the
strange
part
of
his
story
is
that
he
set
out
upon
his
journey
from
cherryburn
near
newcastle
with
only
three
guineas
sewed
in
his
waistband
and
when
he
reached
home
he
had
still
a
few
shillings
left
in
his
pocket
in
telford
was
called
upon
by
the
government
to
make
a
survey
of
scotland
and
report
as
to
the
measures
which
were
necessary
for
the
improvement
of
the
roads
and
bridges
of
that
part
of
the
kingdom
and
also
on
the
means
of
promoting
the
fisheries
on
the
east
and
west
coasts
with
the
object
of
better
opening
up
the
country
and
preventing
further
extensive
emigration
previous
to
this
time
he
had
been
employed
by
the
british
fisheries
society
of
which
his
friend
sir
william
pulteney
was
governor
to
inspect
the
harbours
at
their
several
stations
and
to
devise
a
plan
for
the
establishment
of
a
fishery
on
the
coast
of
caithness
he
accordingly
made
an
extensive
tour
of
scotland
examining
among
other
harbours
that
of
annan
from
which
he
proceeded
northward
by
aberdeen
to
wick
and
thurso
returning
to
shrewsbury
by
edinburgh
and
dumfries
he
accumulated
a
large
mass
of
data
for
his
report
which
was
sent
in
to
the
fishery
society
with
charts
and
plans
in
the
course
of
the
following
year
in
july
he
was
requested
by
the
lords
of
the
treasury
most
probably
in
consequence
of
the
preceding
report
to
make
a
further
survey
of
the
interior
of
the
highlands
the
result
of
which
he
communicated
in
his
report
presented
to
parliament
in
the
following
year
although
full
of
important
local
business
kept
running
as
he
says
from
town
to
country
and
from
country
to
town
never
when
awake
and
perhaps
not
always
when
asleep
have
my
scotch
surveys
been
absent
from
my
mind
he
had
worked
very
hard
at
his
report
and
hoped
that
it
might
be
productive
of
some
good
the
report
was
duly
presented
printed
and
approved
and
it
formed
the
of
a
system
of
legislation
with
reference
to
the
highlands
which
extended
over
many
years
and
had
the
effect
of
completely
opening
up
that
romantic
but
rugged
district
of
country
and
extending
to
its
inhabitants
the
advantages
of
improved
intercourse
with
the
other
parts
of
the
kingdom
telford
pointed
out
that
the
military
roads
were
altogether
inadequate
to
the
requirements
of
the
population
and
that
the
use
of
them
was
in
many
places
very
much
circumscribed
by
the
want
of
bridges
over
some
of
the
principal
rivers
for
instance
the
route
from
edinburgh
to
inverness
through
the
central
highlands
was
seriously
interrupted
at
dunkeld
where
the
tay
is
broad
and
deep
and
not
always
easy
to
be
crossed
by
means
of
a
boat
the
route
to
the
same
place
by
the
east
coast
was
in
like
manner
broken
at
fochabers
where
the
rapid
spey
could
only
be
crossed
by
a
dangerous
ferry
the
difficulties
encountered
by
gentlemen
of
the
bar
in
travelling
the
north
circuit
about
this
time
are
well
described
by
lord
cockburn
in
his
those
who
are
born
to
modem
travelling
he
says
can
scarcely
be
made
to
understand
how
the
previous
age
got
on
the
state
of
the
roads
may
be
judged
of
from
two
or
three
facts
there
was
no
bridge
over
the
tay
at
dunkeld
or
over
the
spey
at
fochabers
or
over
the
findhorn
at
forres
nothing
but
wretched
pierless
ferries
let
to
poor
cottars
who
rowed
or
hauled
or
pushed
a
crazy
boat
across
or
more
commonly
got
their
wives
to
do
it
there
was
no
north
of
aberdeen
till
i
think
after
the
battle
of
waterloo
what
it
must
have
been
a
few
years
before
my
time
may
be
judged
of
from
to
lord
braxfield
published
in
he
thinks
that
besides
a
carriage
and
his
own
every
judge
ought
to
have
his
and
ought
not
to
travel
faster
than
the
waggon
which
carried
the
baggage
of
the
circuit
i
understood
from
hope
that
after
when
he
came
to
the
bar
he
and
braxfield
rode
a
whole
north
circuit
and
that
from
the
findhorn
being
in
a
flood
they
were
obliged
to
go
up
its
banks
for
about
miles
to
the
bridge
of
dulsie
before
they
could
cross
i
myself
rode
circuits
when
i
was
between
and
the
fashion
of
every
depute
carrying
his
own
shell
on
his
back
in
the
form
of
his
own
carriage
is
a
piece
of
very
modern
antiquity
north
of
inverness
matters
were
if
possible
still
worse
there
was
no
bridge
over
the
beauly
or
the
conan
the
drovers
coming
south
swam
the
rivers
with
their
cattle
there
being
no
roads
there
was
little
use
for
carts
in
the
whole
county
of
caithness
there
was
scarcely
a
farmer
who
owned
a
burdens
were
conveyed
usually
on
the
backs
of
ponies
but
quite
as
often
on
the
backs
of
women
the
interior
of
the
county
of
sutherland
being
almost
inaccessible
the
only
track
lay
along
the
shore
among
rocks
and
sand
and
was
covered
by
the
sea
at
every
tide
the
people
lay
scattered
in
inaccessible
straths
and
spots
among
the
mountains
where
they
lived
in
family
with
their
pigs
and
kyloes
cattle
in
turf
cabins
of
the
most
miserable
description
they
spoke
only
gaelic
and
spent
the
whole
of
their
time
in
indolence
and
sloth
thus
they
had
gone
on
from
father
to
son
with
little
change
except
what
the
introduction
of
illicit
distillation
had
wrought
and
making
little
or
no
export
from
the
country
beyond
the
few
lean
kyloes
which
paid
the
rent
and
produced
wherewithal
to
pay
for
the
oatmeal
imported
telford
first
recommendation
was
that
a
bridge
should
be
thrown
across
the
tay
at
dunkeld
to
connect
the
improved
lines
of
road
proposed
to
be
made
on
each
side
of
the
river
he
regarded
this
measure
as
of
the
first
importance
to
the
central
highlands
and
as
the
duke
of
athol
was
willing
to
pay
of
the
cost
of
the
erection
if
the
government
would
defray
the
other
the
bridge
to
be
free
of
toll
after
a
certain
period
it
appeared
to
the
engineer
that
this
was
a
reasonable
and
just
mode
of
providing
for
the
contingency
in
the
next
place
he
recommended
a
bridge
over
the
spey
which
drained
a
great
extent
of
mountainous
country
and
being
liable
to
sudden
inundations
was
very
dangerous
to
cross
yet
this
ferry
formed
the
only
link
of
communication
between
the
whole
of
the
northern
counties
the
site
pointed
out
for
the
proposed
bridge
was
adjacent
to
the
town
of
fochabers
and
here
also
the
duke
of
gordon
and
other
county
gentlemen
were
willing
to
provide
of
the
means
for
its
erection
telford
further
described
in
detail
the
roads
necessary
to
be
constructed
in
the
north
and
west
highlands
with
the
object
of
opening
up
the
western
parts
of
the
counties
of
inverness
and
ross
and
affording
a
ready
communication
from
the
clyde
to
the
fishing
lochs
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
isle
of
skye
as
to
the
means
of
executing
these
improvements
he
suggested
that
government
would
be
justified
in
dealing
with
the
highland
roads
and
bridges
as
exceptional
and
extraordinary
works
and
extending
the
public
aid
towards
carrying
them
into
effect
as
but
for
such
assistance
the
country
must
remain
perhaps
for
ages
to
come
imperfectly
opened
up
his
report
further
embraced
certain
improvements
in
the
harbours
of
aberdeen
and
wick
and
a
description
of
the
country
through
which
the
proposed
line
of
the
caledonian
canal
would
necessarily
pass
a
canal
which
had
long
been
the
subject
of
inquiry
but
had
not
as
yet
emerged
from
a
state
of
mere
speculation
the
new
roads
bridges
and
other
improvements
suggested
by
the
engineer
excited
much
interest
in
the
north
the
highland
society
voted
him
their
thanks
by
acclamation
the
counties
of
inverness
and
ross
followed
and
he
had
letters
of
thanks
and
congratulation
from
many
of
the
highland
chiefs
if
they
will
persevere
says
he
with
anything
like
their
present
zeal
they
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
greatly
improving
a
country
that
has
been
too
long
neglected
things
are
greatly
changed
now
in
the
highlands
even
were
the
chiefs
to
quarrel
a
highlandman
would
stir
for
them
the
lairds
have
transferred
their
affections
from
their
people
to
flocks
of
sheep
and
the
people
have
lost
their
veneration
for
the
lairds
it
seems
to
be
the
natural
progress
of
society
but
it
is
not
an
altogether
satisfactory
change
there
were
some
fine
features
in
the
former
patriarchal
state
of
society
but
now
clanship
is
gone
and
chiefs
and
people
are
hastening
into
the
opposite
extreme
this
seems
to
me
to
be
quite
wrong
in
the
same
year
telford
was
elected
a
member
of
the
royal
society
of
edinburgh
on
which
occasion
he
was
proposed
and
supported
by
three
professors
so
that
the
former
edinburgh
mason
was
rising
in
the
world
and
receiving
due
honour
in
his
own
country
the
effect
of
his
report
was
such
that
in
the
session
of
a
parliamentary
commission
was
appointed
under
whose
direction
a
series
of
practical
improvements
was
commenced
which
issued
in
the
construction
of
not
less
than
additional
miles
of
roads
and
bridges
throughout
the
highlands
of
the
cost
of
which
was
defrayed
by
the
government
and
the
other
half
by
local
assessment
but
in
addition
to
these
main
lines
of
communication
numberless
county
roads
were
formed
by
statute
labour
under
local
road
acts
and
by
other
means
the
of
sutherland
alone
constructing
nearly
miles
of
district
roads
at
their
own
cost

of

by
the
end
of
the
session
of
telford
received
his
instructions
from
vansittart
as
to
the
working
survey
he
was
forthwith
required
to
enter
upon
with
a
view
to
commencing
practical
operations
and
he
again
proceeded
to
the
highlands
to
lay
out
the
roads
and
plan
the
bridges
which
were
most
urgently
needed
the
district
of
the
solway
was
at
his
representation
included
with
the
object
of
improving
the
road
from
carlisle
to
portpatrick
the
nearest
point
at
which
great
britain
meets
the
irish
coast
and
where
the
sea
passage
forms
only
a
sort
of
wide
ferry
it
would
occupy
too
much
space
and
indeed
it
is
altogether
unnecessary
to
describe
in
detail
the
operations
of
the
commission
and
of
their
engineer
in
opening
up
the
communications
of
the
highlands
suffice
it
to
say
that
one
of
the
first
things
taken
in
hand
was
the
connection
of
the
existing
lines
of
road
by
means
of
bridges
at
the
more
important
points
such
as
at
dunkeld
over
the
tay
and
near
dingwall
over
the
conan
and
orrin
that
of
dunkeld
was
the
most
important
as
being
situated
at
the
entrance
to
the
central
highlands
and
at
the
second
meeting
of
the
commissioners
telford
submitted
his
plan
and
estimates
of
the
proposed
bridge
in
consequence
of
some
difference
with
the
duke
of
athol
as
to
his
share
of
the
expense
which
proved
to
be
greater
than
he
had
estimated
some
delay
occurred
in
beginning
the
work
but
at
length
it
was
fairly
started
and
after
being
about
three
years
in
hand
the
structure
was
finished
and
opened
for
traffic
in
image
dunkeld

the
bridge
is
a
handsome
one
of
five
river
and
two
land
arches
the
span
of
the
centre
arch
is
feet
of
the
two
adjoining
it

of
the

side
arches
feet
affording
a
clear
waterway
of
feet
the
total
breadth
of
the
roadway
and

the
cost
of
the
structure
was
about
of
which
was
defrayed
by
the
duke
of
athol
dunkeld
bridge
now
forms
a
fine
feature
in
a
landscape
not
often
surpassed
and
which
presents
within
a
comparatively
small
compass
a
great
variety
of
character
and
beauty
the
communication
by
road
north
of
inverness
was
also
perfected
by
the
construction
of
a
bridge
of
five
arches
over
the
beauly
and
another
of
the
same
number
over
the
conan
the
central
arch
being
feet
span
and
the
formerly
wretched
bit
of
road
between
these
points
having
been
put
in
good
repair
the
town
of
dingwall
was
thenceforward
rendered
easily
approachable
from
the
south
at
the
same
time
a
beginning
was
made
with
the
construction
of
new
roads
through
the
districts
most
in
need
of
them
the
first
contracted
for
was
the
road
from
fort
william
to
arasaig
on
the
western
coast
nearly
opposite
the
island
of
egg
another
was
begun
from
loch
oich
on
the
line
of
the
caledonian
canal
across
the
middle
of
the
highlands
through
glengarry
to
loch
hourn
on
the
western
sea
other
roads
were
opened
north
and
south
through
morvern
to
loch
moidart
through
glen
morrison
and
glen
sheil
and
through
the
entire
isle
of
skye
from
dingwall
eastward
to
lochcarron
and
loch
torridon
quite
through
the
county
of
ross
and
from
dingwall
northward
through
the
county
of
sutherland
as
far
as
tongue
on
the
pentland
frith
while
another
line
striking
off
at
the
head
of
the
dornoch
frith
proceeded
along
the
coast
in
a
direction
to
wick
and
thurso
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
john
o
groats
there
were
numerous
other
subordinate
lines
of
road
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
specify
in
detail
but
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
their
extent
as
well
as
of
the
rugged
character
of
the
country
through
which
they
were
carried
when
we
state
that
they
involved
the
construction
of
no
fewer
than
twelve
hundred
bridges
several
important
bridges
were
also
erected
at
other
points
to
connect
existing
roads
such
as
those
at
ballater
and
potarch
over
the
dee
at
alford
over
the
don
and
at
over
the
spey
the
bridge
is
a
remarkably
elegant
structure
thrown
over
the
spey
at
a
point
where
the
river
rushing
obliquely
against
the
lofty
rock
of
has
formed
for
itself
a
deep
channel
not
exceeding
fifty
yards
in
breadth
only
a
few
years
before
there
had
not
been
any
provision
for
crossing
this
river
at
its
lower
parts
except
the
very
dangerous
ferry
at
fochabers
the
duke
of
gordon
had
however
erected
a
suspension
bridge
at
that
town
and
the
inconvenience
was
in
a
great
measure
removed
its
utility
was
so
generally
felt
that
the
demand
arose
for
a
second
bridge
across
the
river
for
there
was
not
another
by
which
it
could
be
crossed
for
a
distance
of
nearly
fifty
miles
up
strath
spey
it
was
a
difficult
stream
to
span
by
a
bridge
at
any
place
in
consequence
of
the
violence
with
which
the
floods
descended
at
particular
seasons
sometimes
even
in
summer
when
not
a
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
the
flood
would
come
down
the
strath
in
great
fury
sweeping
everything
before
it
this
remarkable
phenomenon
being
accounted
for
by
the
prevalence
of
a
strong
wind
which
blew
the
loch
waters
from
their
beds
into
the
strath
and
thus
suddenly
filled
the
valley
of
the
spey
the
same
phenomenon
similarly
caused
is
also
frequently
observed
in
the
neighbouring
river
the
findhorn
cooped
up
in
its
deep
rocky
bed
where
the
water
sometimes
comes
down
in
a
wave
six
feet
high
like
a
liquid
wall
sweeping
everything
before
it
to
meet
such
a
contingency
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
provide
abundant
waterway
and
to
build
a
bridge
offering
as
little
resistance
as
possible
to

accordingly
designed
for
the
passage
of
the
river
at
a
light
arch
of
feet
span
with
a
rise
of
feet
the
arch
being
composed
of
four
ribs
each
consisting
of
two
concentric
arcs
forming
panels
which
are
filled
in
with
diagonal
bars
the
roadway
is
feet
wide
and
is
formed
of
another
arc
of
greater
radius
attached
to
which
is
the
iron
railing
the
spandrels
being
filled
by
diagonal
ties
forming

robert
stephenson
took
objection
to
the
two
dissimilar
arches
as
liable
to
subject
the
structure
from
variations
of
temperature
to
very
unequal
strains
nevertheless
this
bridge
as
well
as
many
others
constructed
by
telford
after
a
similar
plan
has
stood
perfectly
well
and
to
this
day
remains
a
very
serviceable
structure
image
bridge
its
appearance
is
highly
picturesque
the
scattered
pines
and
beech
trees
on
the
side
of
the
impending
mountain
the
meadows
along
the
valley
of
the
spey
and
the
western
approach
road
to
the
bridge
cut
deeply
into
the
face
of
the
rock
combine
with
the
slender
appearance
of
the
iron
arch
in
rendering
this
spot
one
of
the
most
remarkable
in
scotland
an
iron
bridge
of
a
similar
span
to
that
at
had
previously
been
constructed
across
the
head
of
the
dornoch
frith
at
bonar
near
the
point
where
the
waters
of
the
shin
join
the
sea
the
very
severe
trial
which
this
structure
sustained
from
the
tremendous
blow
of
an
irregular
mass
of
logs
consolidated
by
ice
as
well
as
shortly
after
from
the
blow
of
a
schooner
which
drifted
against
it
on
the
opposite
side
and
had
her
two
masts
knocked
off
by
the
collision
gave
him
every
confidence
in
the
strength
of
this
form
of
construction
and
he
accordingly
repeated
it
in
several
of
his
subsequent
bridges
though
none
of
them
are
comparable
in
beauty
with
that
of
thus
in
the
course
of
eighteen
years
miles
of
capital
roads
connected
together
by
no
fewer
than
bridges
were
added
to
the
road
communications
of
the
highlands
at
an
expense
defrayed
partly
by
the
localities
immediately
benefited
and
partly
by
the
nation
the
effects
of
these
twenty
years
operations
were
such
as
follow
the
making
of
roads
everywhere
development
of
industry
and
increase
of
civilization
in
no
districts
were
the
benefits
derived
from
them
more
marked
than
in
the
remote
northern
counties
of
sutherland
and
caithness
the
first
that
ran
northward
from
perth
to
inverness
were
tried
in
and
became
regularly
established
in
and
by
the
year
no
fewer
than
forty
arrived
at
the
latter
town
in
the
course
of
every
week
and
the
same
number
departed
from
it
others
were
established
in
various
directions
through
the
highlands
which
were
rendered
as
accessible
as
any
english
county
agriculture
made
rapid
progress
the
use
of
carts
became
practicable
and
manure
was
no
longer
carried
to
the
field
on
women
backs
sloth
and
idleness
gradually
disappeared
before
the
energy
activity
and
industry
which
were
called
into
life
by
the
improved
communications
better
built
cottages
took
the
place
of
the
old
mud
biggins
with
holes
in
their
roofs
to
let
out
the
smoke
the
pigs
and
cattle
were
treated
to
a
separate
table
the
dunghill
was
turned
to
the
outside
of
the
house
tartan
tatters
gave
place
to
the
produce
of
manchester
and
glasgow
looms
and
very
soon
few
young
persons
were
to
be
found
who
could
not
both
read
and
write
english
but
not
less
remarkable
were
the
effects
of
the
upon
the
industrial
habits
of
the
people
before
telford
went
into
the
highlands
they
did
not
know
how
to
work
having
never
been
accustomed
to
labour
continuously
and
systematically
let
our
engineer
himself
describe
the
moral
influences
of
his
highland
contracts
in
these
works
says
he
and
in
the
caledonian
canal
about
three
thousand
two
hundred
men
have
been
annually
employed
at
first
they
could
scarcely
work
at
all
they
were
totally
unacquainted
with
labour
they
could
not
use
the
tools
they
have
since
become
excellent
labourers
and
of
the
above
number
we
consider
about
left
us
annually
taught
to
work
these
undertakings
may
indeed
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
working
academy
from
which
eight
hundred
men
have
annually
gone
forth
improved
workmen
they
have
either
returned
to
their
native
districts
with
the
advantage
of
having
used
the
most
perfect
sort
of
tools
and
utensils
which
alone
can
not
be
estimated
at
less
than
ten
per
cent
on
any
sort
of
labour
or
they
have
been
usefully
distributed
through
the
other
parts
of
the
country
since
these
roads
were
made
accessible
wheelwrights
and
cartwrights
have
been
established
the
plough
has
been
introduced
and
improved
tools
and
utensils
are
generally
used
the
plough
was
not
previously
employed
in
the
interior
and
mountainous
parts
they
used
crooked
sticks
with
iron
on
them
drawn
or
pushed
along
the
moral
habits
of
the
great
masses
of
the
working
classes
are
changed
they
see
that
they
may
depend
on
their
own
exertions
for
support
this
goes
on
silently
and
is
scarcely
perceived
until
apparent
by
the
results
i
consider
these
improvements
among
the
greatest
blessings
ever
conferred
on
any
country
about
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
has
been
granted
in
fifteen
years
it
has
been
the
means
of
advancing
the
country
at
least
a
century
the
progress
made
in
the
lowland
districts
of
scotland
since
the
same
period
has
been
no
less
remarkable
if
the
state
of
the
country
as
we
have
above
described
it
from
authentic
documents
be
compared
with
what
it
is
now
it
will
be
found
that
there
are
few
countries
which
have
accomplished
so
much
within
so
short
a
period
it
is
usual
to
cite
the
united
states
as
furnishing
the
most
extraordinary
instance
of
social
progress
in
modem
times
but
america
has
had
the
advantage
of
importing
its
civilization
for
the
most
part
ready
made
whereas
that
of
scotland
has
been
entirely
her
own
creation
by
nature
america
is
rich
and
of
boundless
extent
whereas
scotland
is
by
nature
poor
the
greater
part
of
her
limited
area
consisting
of
sterile
heath
and
mountain
little
more
than
a
century
ago
scotland
was
considerably
in
the
rear
of
ireland
it
was
a
country
almost
without
agriculture
without
mines
without
fisheries
without
shipping
without
money
without
roads
the
people
were
half
barbarous
and
habitually
indolent
the
colliers
and
salters
were
veritable
slaves
and
were
subject
to
be
sold
together
with
the
estates
to
which
they
belonged
what
do
we
find
now
praedial
slavery
completely
abolished
heritable
jurisdictions
at
an
end
the
face
of
the
country
entirely
changed
its
agriculture
acknowledged
to
be
the
first
in
the
world
its
mines
and
fisheries
productive
in
the
highest
degree
its
banking
a
model
of
efficiency
and
public
usefulness
its
roads
equal
to
the
best
roads
in
england
or
in
europe
the
people
are
active
and
energetic
alike

in

a
source
of
wealth
and
power
not
only
to
their
own
country
but
to
the
world
at
large
while
telford
by
his
roads
bound
england
and
scotland
before
separated
firmly
into
one
and
rendered
the
union
a
source
of
wealth
and
strength
to
both
at
the
same
time
active
and
powerful
minds
were
occupied

extending
the
domain
of

adam
smith
in
political
economy
reid
and
dugald
stewart
in
moral
philosophy
and
black
and
robison
in
physical
science
and
thus
scotland
instead
of
being
one
of
the
idlest
and
most
backward
countries
in
europe
has
within
the
compass
of
little
more
than
a
lifetime
issued
in
one
of
the
most
active
contented
and
prosperous
exercising
an
amount
of
influence
upon
the
literature
science
political
economy
and
industry
of
modern
times
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
natural
resources
of
its
soil
or
the
amount
of
its
population
if
we
look
for
the
causes
of
this
extraordinary
social
progress
we
shall
probably
find
the
principal
to
consist
in
the
fact
that
scotland
though
originally
poor
as
a
country
was
rich
in
parish
schools
founded
under
the
provisions
of
an
act
passed
by
the
scottish
parliament
in
the
year
it
was
there
ordained
that
there
be
a
school
settled
and
established
and
a
schoolmaster
appointed
in
every
parish
not
already
provided
by
advice
of
the
heritors
and
minister
of
the
parish
common
were
accordingly
provided
and
maintained
throughout
the
country
for
the
education
of
children
of
all
ranks
and
conditions
the
consequence
was
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
generations
these
schools
working
steadily
upon
the
minds
of
the
young
all
of
whom
passed
under
the
hands
of
the
teachers
educated
the
population
into
a
state
of
intelligence
and
aptitude
greatly
in
advance
of
their
material
and
it
is
in
this
circumstance
we
apprehend
that
the
explanation
is
to
be
found
of
the
rapid
start
forward
which
the
whole
country
took
dating
more
particularly
from
the
year
agriculture
was
naturally
the
first
branch
of
industry
to
exhibit
signs
of
decided
improvement
to
be
speedily
followed
by
like
advances
in
trade
commerce
and
manufactures
indeed
from
that
time
the
country
never
looked
back
but
her
progress
went
on
at
a
constantly
accelerated
rate
issuing
in
results
as
marvellous
as
they
have
probably
been
unprecedented

no
sooner
were
the
highland
roads
and
bridges
in
full
progress
than
attention
was
directed
to
the
improvement
of
the
harbours
round
the
coast
very
little
had
as
yet
been
done
for
them
beyond
what
nature
had
effected
happily
there
was
a
public
fund
at
disposal
the
accumulation
of
rents
and
profits
derived
from
the
estates
forfeited
at
the
rebellion
of
which
was
available
for
the
purpose
the
suppression
of
the
rebellion
did
good
in
many
ways
it
broke
the
feudal
spirit
which
lingered
in
the
highlands
long
after
it
had
ceased
in
every
other
part
of
britain
it
led
to
the
effectual
opening
up
of
the
country
by
a
system
of
good
roads
and
now
the
accumulated
rents
of
the
defeated
jacobite
chiefs
were
about
to
be
applied
to
the
improvement
of
the
highland
harbours
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
population
the
harbour
of
wick
was
one
of
the
first
to
which
attention
was
directed
rennie
had
reported
on
the
subject
of
its
improvement
as
early
as
the
year
but
his
plans
were
not
adopted
because
their
execution
was
beyond
the
means
of
the
locality
at
that
time
the
place
had
now
however
become
of
considerable
importance
it
was
largely
frequented
by
dutch
fishermen
during
the
herring
season
and
it
was
hoped
that
if
they
could
be
induced
to
form
a
settlement
at
the
place
their
example
might
exercise
a
beneficial
influence
upon
the
population
telford
reported
that
by
the
expenditure
of
about
a
capacious
and
tidal
basin
might
be
formed
capable
of
containing
about
two
hundred
the
commission
adopted
his
plan
and
voted
the
requisite
funds
for
carrying
out
the
works
which
were
begun
in
the
new
station
was
named
pulteney
town
in
compliment
to
sir
william
pulteney
the
governor
of
the

society
and
the
harbour
was
built
at
a
cost
of
about
of
which
was
granted
from
the
forfeited
estates

handsome
stone
bridge
erected
over
the
river
wick
in
after
the
design
of
our
engineer
connect
these
improvements
with
the
older
town
it
is
formed
of
three
arches
having
a
clear
waterway
of
feet
the
money
was
well
expended
as
the
result
proved
and
wick
is
now
we
believe
the
greatest
fishing
station
in
the
world
the
place
has
increased
from
a
little
village
to
a
large
and
thriving
town
which
swarms
during
the
fishing
season
with
lowland
scotchmen
fair
northmen
dutchmen
and
kilted
highlanders
the
bay
is
at
that
time
frequented
by
upwards
of
a
thousand
and
the
take
of
herrings
in
some
years
amounts
to
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
barrels
the
harbour
has
of
late
years
been
considerably
improved
to
meet
the
growing
requirements
of
the
herring
trade

improvements
of

kind
were
carried
out

many
snug
and
convenient
harbours
were
provided
at
the
principal

islands
where
the
local
proprietors
were
themselves
found
expending
money
in

the

assisted
them
with

to
enable
the
works
to
be
constructed
in
the
most
substantial
manner

it
may
be
mentioned
that
about
sixty
years
since
the
port
was
formed
by
the
island
called
keith
island
situated
a
small
distance
eastward
from
the
shore
between
which
and
the
mainland
an
arm
of
the
sea
formerly
passed
a
causeway
had
however
been
formed
across
this
channel
thus
dividing
it
into
two
small
bays
after
which
the
southern
one
had
been
converted
in
to
a
harbour
by
means
of
two
rude
piers
erected
along
either
side
of
it

north
inlet
remained
without

being
very

exposed
to

the
first
works
carried
out
at
peterhead
were
of
a
comparatively
limited
character
the
old
piers
of
the
south
harbour
having
been
built
by
smeaton
but
improvements
proceeded
apace
with
the
enterprise
and
wealth
of
the
inhabitants

and
after
him
telford
fully
reported
as
to
the
capabilities
of
the
port
and
the
best
means
of
improving
it
rennie
recommended
the
deepening
of
the
south
harbour
and
the
extension
of
the
jetty
of
the
west
pier
at
the
same
time
cutting
off
all
projections
of
rock
from
keith
island
on
the
eastward
so
as
to
render
the
access
more
easy

harbour
when
thus
finished
would
he
estimated
give
about
feet
depth
at
high
water
of
spring

he
also
proposed
to
open
a
communication
across
the
causeway
between
the
north
and
south
harbours
and
form
a
wet
dock
between
them
feet
long
and
feet
wide
the
water
being
kept
in
by
gates
at
each
end
he
further
proposed
to
provide
an
entirely
new
harbour
by
constructing
two
extensive
piers
for
the
effectual
protection
of
the
northern
part
of
the
channel
running
out
one
from
a
rock
north
of
the
green
island
about
feet
long
and
another
from
the
roan
head
feet
long
leaving
an
opening
between
them
of
yards
this
comprehensive
plan
unhappily
could
not
be
carried
out
at
the
time
for
want
of
funds
but
it
may
be
said
to
have
formed
the
groundwork
of
all
that
has
been
subsequently
done
for
the
improvement
of
the
port
of
peterhead
it
was
resolved
in
the
first
place
to
commence
operations
by
improving
the
south
harbour
and
protecting
it
more
effectually
from
winds
the
bottom
of
the
harbour
was
accordingly
deepened
by
cutting
out
cubic
yards
of
rocky
ground
and
part
of
rennie
design
was
carried
out
by
extending
the
jetty
of
the
west
pier
though
only
for
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
these
works
were
executed
under
directions
they
were
completed
by
the
end
of
the
year
and
proved
to
be
of
great
public
convenience
the
trade
of
the
town
however
so
much
increased
and
the
port
was
found
of
such
importance
as
a
place
of
refuge
for
vessels
frequenting
the
north
seas
that
in
it
was
determined
to
proceed
with
the
formation
of
a
harbour
on
the
northern
part
of
the
old
channel
and
the
inhabitants
having
agreed
among
themselves
to
contribute
to
the
extent
of
towards
carrying
out
the
necessary
works
they
applied
for
the
grant
of
a
like
sum
from
the
forfeited
estates
fund
which
was
eventually
voted
for
the
purpose
the
plan
adopted
was
on
a
more
limited
scale
than
that
proposed
by
rennie
but
in
the
same
direction
and
contrived
with
the
same
object
so
that
when
completed
vessels
of
the
largest
burden
employed
in
the
greenland
fishery
might
be
able
to
enter
one
or
other
of
the
two
harbours
and
find
safe
shelter
from
whatever
quarter
the
wind
might
blow
the
works
were
vigorously
proceeded
with
and
had
made
considerable
progress
when
in
october
a
violent
hurricane
from
the
which
raged
along
the
coast
for
several
days
and
inflicted
heavy
damage
on
many
of
the
northern
harbours
destroyed
a
large
part
of
the
unfinished
masonry
and
hurled
the
heaviest
blocks
into
the
sea
tossing
them
about
as
if
they
had
been
pebbles
the
finished
work
had
however
stood
well
and
the
foundations
of
the
piers
under
low
water
were
ascertained
to
have
remained
comparatively
uninjured
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
to
repair
the
damaged
work
though
it
involved
a
heavy
additional
cost
of
which
was
borne
by
the
forfeited
estates
fund
and
the
remainder
by
the
inhabitants
increased
strength
was
also
given
to
the
more
exposed
parts
of
the
pierwork
and
the
slope
at
the
sea
side
of
the
breakwater
was
considerably
extended
those
alterations
in
the
design
were
carried
out
together
with
a
spacious
as
shown
in
the
preceding
plan
and
they
proved
completely
successful
enabling
peterhead
to
offer
an
amount
of
accommodation
for
shipping
of
a
more
effectual
kind
than
was
at
that
time
to
be
met

the
whole

on

projecting
point

the
foot

twenty
miles
north

become
so
ruinous
that
vessels
lying
within
it
received
almost
as
little
shelter
as
if
they
had
been
exposed
in
the
open
sea
rennie
had
prepared
a
plan
for
its
improvement
by
running
out
a
substantial
pier
and
this
was
eventually
carried
out
by
telford
in
a
modified
form
proving
of
substantial
service
to
the
trade
of
the
port

harbour
has
been
formed
at

place

at

expense

at

were
so
apparent
that
a

determined
to
extend

that
it

to

by
dropping
large
stones
from
lighters
and
filling
the
interstices
with
smaller
ones
until

within
about

in

was
laid
at
an
angle

when

this
mode

lying
in
the
great
glen
of
the
highlands
and
extending
diagonally
across
scotland
from
the
atlantic
to
the
north
sea
had
long
been
regarded
as
a
work
of
national
importance
as
early
as
james
watt
then
following
the
business
of
a
at
glasgow
made
a
survey
of
the
country
at
the
instance
of
the
commissioners
of
forfeited
estates
he
pronounced
the
canal
practicable
and
pointed
out
how
it
could
best
be
constructed
there
was
certainly
no
want
of
water
for
watt
was
repeatedly
drenched
with
rain
while
he
was
making
his
survey
and
he
had
difficulty
in
preserving
even
his
journal
book
on
my
way
home
he
says
i
passed
through
the
wildest
country
i
ever
saw
and
over
the
worst
conducted
roads
twenty
years
later
in
rennie
was
consulted
as
to
the
canal
and
he
also
prepared
a
scheme
but
nothing
was
done
the
project
was
however
revived
in
during
the
war
with
napoleon
when
various
inland
ship
canals
such
as
those
from
london
to
portsmouth
and
from
bristol
to
the
english
channel
were
under
consideration
with
the
view
of
enabling
british
shipping
to
pass
from
one
part
of
the
kingdom
to
another
without
being
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
french
privateers
but
there
was
another
reason
for
urging
the
formation
of
the
canal
through
the
great
glen
of
scotland
which
was
regarded
as
of
considerable
importance
before
the
introduction
of
steam
enabled
vessels
to
set
the
winds
and
tides
at
comparative
defiance
it
was
this
vessels
sailing
from
the
eastern
ports
to
america
had
to
beat
up
the
pentland
frith
often
against
adverse
winds
and
stormy
seas
which
rendered
the
navigation
both
tedious
and
dangerous
thus
it
was
cited
by
sir
edward
parry
in
his
evidence
before
parliament
in
favour
of
completing
the
caledonian
canal
that
of
two
vessels
despatched
from
newcastle
on
the
same
day
one
bound
for
liverpool
by
the
north
of
scotland
and
the
other
for
bombay
by
the
english
channel
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
the
latter
reached
its
destination
first
another
case
may
be
mentioned
that
of
an
inverness
vessel
which
sailed
for
liverpool
on
a
christmas
day
reached
stromness
harbour
in
orkney
on
the
of
january
and
lay
there
windbound
with
a
fleet
of
other
traders
until
the
middle
of
april
following
in
fact
the
pentland
frith
which
is
the
throat
connecting
the
atlantic
and
german
oceans
through
which
the
former
rolls
its
long
majestic
waves
with
tremendous
force
was
long
the
dread
of
mariners
and
it
was
considered
an
object
of
national
importance
to
mitigate
the
dangers
of
the
passage
towards
the
western
seas
as
the
lochs
occupying
the
chief
part
of
the
bottom
of
the
great
glen
were
of
sufficient
depth
to
be
navigable
by
large
vessels
it
was
thought
that
if
they
could
be
connected
by
a
ship
canal
so
as
to
render
the
line
of
navigation
continuous
it
would
be
used
by
shipping
to
a
large
extent
and
prove
of
great
public
service
five
hundred
miles
of
dangerous
navigation
by
the
orkneys
and
cape
wrath
would
thereby
be
saved
while
ships
of
war
were
this
track
open
to
them

reach
the
north
of
ireland
in
two
days
from
fort
george
near
inverness
when
the
scheme
of
the
proposed
canal
was
revived
in
telford
was
requested
to
make
a
survey
and
send
in
his
report
on
the
subject
he
immediately
wrote
to
his
friend
james
watt
saying
i
have
so
long
accustomed
myself
to
look
with
a
degree
of
reverence
at
your
work
that
i
am
particularly
anxious
to
learn
what
occurred
to
you
in
this
business
while
the
whole
was
fresh
in
your
mind
the
object
appears
to
me
so
great
and
so
desirable
that
i
am
convinced
you
will
feel
a
pleasure
in
bringing
it
again
under
investigation
and
i
am
very
desirous
that
the
thing
should
be
fully
and
fairly
explained
so
that
the
public
may
be
made
aware
of
its
extensive
utility
if
i
can
accomplish
this
i
shall
have
done
my
duty
and
if
the
project
is
not
executed
now
some
future
period
will
see
it
done
and
i
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
having
followed
you
and
promoted
its
success
we
may
here
state
that
telford
survey
agreed
with
watt
in
the
most
important
particulars
and
that
he
largely
cited
watt
descriptions
of
the
proposed
scheme
in
his
own
report
telford
first
inspection
of
the
district
was
made
in
and
his
report
was
sent
in
to
the
treasury
in
the
course
of
the
following
year
lord
bexley
then
secretary
to
the

took
a
warm
personal
interest
in
the
project
and
lost
no
opportunity
of
actively
promoting
it
a

eventually
appointed

the

without

partly
from

partly
from
the
necessity
of
placing

absolute
mud

afforded
no
foundation
other
than
what
was
created
by
compression
and
the
mud
was
forced
down
by
throwing
upon

an
immense
load
of
earth
and
stones

was
left
during
twelve
months
to
settle

the

reference
is
made
to
this
important
work
which
was
finished
in
the
depth
of
the
mud
on
which
it
may
be
said
to
be
artificially
seated
is
not
less
than
feet
so
that
it
can
not
be
deemed
superfluous
at
the
end
of
seven
years
to
state
that
no
subsidence
is
discoverable
and
we
presume
that
the
entire
lock
as
well
as
every
part
of
it
may
now
be
deemed
as
immovable
and
as
little
liable
to
destruction
as
any
other
large
mass
of
masonry
this
was
the
most
remarkable
work
performed
under
the
immediate
care
of
matthew
davidson
our
superintendent
at
clachnaharry
from
till
the
time
of
his
decease
he
was
a
man
perfectly
qualified
for
the
employment
by
inflexible
integrity
unwearied
industry
and
zeal
to
a
degree
of
anxiety
in
all
the
operations
committed
to
his
care
as
may
naturally
be
supposed
the
execution
of
these
great
works
involved
vast
labour
and
anxiety
they
were
designed
with
much
skill
and
executed
with
equal
ability
there
were
to
be
constructed
principally
of
cast
iron
sheathed
with
pine
planking
eight
public
road
bridges
crossed
the
line
of
the
canal
which
were
made
of
cast
iron
and
swung
horizontally
there
were
many
mountain
streams
swollen
to
torrents
in
winter
crossing
under
the
canal
for
which
abundant
had
to
be
provided
involving
the
construction
of
numerous
culverts
tunnels
and
of
large
dimensions
there
were
also
powerful
sluices
to
let
off
the
excess
of
water
sent
down
from
the
adjacent
mountains
into
the
canal
during
winter
three
of
these
of
great
size
high
above
the
river
lochy
are
constructed
at
a
point
where
the
canal
is
cut
through
the
solid
rock
and
the
sight
of
the
mass
of
waters
rushing
down
into
the
valley
beneath
gives
an
impression
of
power
which
once
seen
is
never
forgotten
these
great
works
were
only
brought
to
a
completion
after
the
labours
of
many
years
during
which
the
difficulties
encountered
in
their
construction
had
swelled
the
cost
of
the
canal
far
beyond
the
original
estimate
the
rapid
advances
which
had
taken
place
in
the
interval
in
the
prices
of
labour
and
materials
also
tended
greatly
to
increase
the
expenses
and
after
all
the
canal
when
completed
and
opened
was
comparatively
little
used
this
was
doubtless
owing
in
a
great
measure
to
the
rapid
changes
which
occurred
in
the
system
of
navigation
shortly
after
the
projection
of
the
undertaking
for
these
telford
was
not
responsible
he
was
called
upon
to
make
the
canal
and
he
did
so
in
the
best
manner
engineers
are
not
required
to
speculate
as
to
the
commercial
value
of
the
works
they
are
required
to
construct
and
there
were
circumstances
connected
with
the
scheme
of
the
caledonian
canal
which
removed
it
from
the
category
of
mere
commercial
adventures
it
was
a
government
project
and
it
proved
a
failure
as
a
paying
concern
hence
it
formed
a
prominent
topic
for
discussion
in
the
journals
of
the
day
but
the
attacks
made
upon
the
government
because
of
their
expenditure
on
the
hapless
undertaking
were
perhaps
more
felt
by
telford
who
was
its
engineer
than
by
all
the
ministers
of
state
conjoined
the
unfortunate
issue
of
this
great
work
writes
the
present
engineer
of
the
canal
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
many
of
the
preceding
facts
was
a
grievous
disappointment
to
telford
and
was
in
fact
the
one
great
bitter
in
his
otherwise
unalloyed
cup
of
happiness
and
prosperity
the
undertaking
was
maligned
by
thousands
who
knew
nothing
of
its
character
it
became
dog
with
a
bad
name
and
all
the
proverbial
consequences
followed
the
most
absurd
errors
and
misconceptions
were
propagated
respecting
it
from
year
to
year
and
it
was
impossible
during
telford
lifetime
to
stem
the
torrent
of
popular
prejudice
and
objurgation
it
must
however
be
admitted
after
a
long
experience
that
telford
was
greatly
in
his
expectations
as
to
the
national
uses
of
the
canal
and
he
was
doomed
to
suffer
acutely
in
his
personal
feelings
little
though
he
may
have
been
personally
to
blame
the
consequences
of
what
in
this
commercial
country
is
regarded
as
so
much
worse
than
a
crime
namely
a
financial
mistake
telford
great
sensitiveness
made
him
feel
the
ill
success
of
this
enterprise
far
more
than
most
other
men
would
have
done
he
was
accustomed
to
throw
himself
into
the
projects
on
which
he
was
employed
with
an
enthusiasm
almost
poetic
he
regarded
them
not
merely
as
so
much
engineering
but
as
works
which
were
to
be
instrumental
in
opening
up
the
communications
of
the
country
and
extending
its
civilization
viewed
in
this
light
his
canals
roads
bridges
and
harbours
were
unquestionably
of
great
national
importance
though
their
commercial
results
might
not
in
all
cases
justify
the
estimates
of
their
projectors
to
refer
to
like
instances
no
one
can
doubt
the
immense
value
and
public
uses
of
rennie
waterloo
bridge
or
robert
stephenson
britannia
and
victoria
bridges
though
every
one
knows
that
commercially
they
have
been
failures
but
it
is
probable
that
neither
of
these
eminent
engineers
gave
himself
anything
like
the
anxious
concern
that
telford
did
about
the
financial
issue
of
his
undertaking
were
railway
engineers
to
fret
and
vex
themselves
about
the
commercial
value
of
the
schemes
in
which
they
have
been
engaged
there
are
few
of
them
but
would
be
so
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
wrecked
speculations
that
they
could
scarcely
lay
their
heads
upon
their
pillows
for
a
single
night
in
peace
while
the
caledonian
canal
was
in
progress
telford
was
occupied
in
various
works
of
a
similar
kind
in
england
and
scotland
and
also
upon
one
in
sweden
in
while
on
one
of
his
journeys
to
the
north
he
was
requested
by
the
earl
of
eglinton
and
others
to
examine
a
project
for
making
a
canal
from
glasgow
to
saltcoats
and
ardrossan
on
the
coast
of
the
county
of
ayr
passing
near
the
important
manufacturing
town
of
paisley
a
new
survey
of
the
line
was
made
and
the
works
were
carried
on
during
several
successive
years
until
a
very
fine
capacious
canal
was
completed
on
the
same
level
as
far
as
paisley
and
johnstown
but
the
funds
of
the
company
falling
short
the
works
were
stopped
and
the
canal
was
carried
no
further
besides
the
measures
adopted
by
the
clyde
trustees
to
deepen
the
bed
of
that
river
and
enable
ships
of
large
burden
to
pass
up
as
high
as
glasgow
had
proved
so
successful
that
the
ultimate
extension
of
the
canal
to
ardrossan
was
no
longer
deemed
necessary
and
the
prosecution
of
the
work
was
accordingly
abandoned
but
as
telford
has
observed
no
person
suspected
when
the
canal
was
laid
out
in
that
steamboats
would
not
only
monopolise
the
trade
of
the
clyde
but
penetrate
into
every
creek
where
there
is
water
to
float
them
in
the
british
isles
and
the
continent
of
europe
and
be
seen
in
every
quarter
of
the
world
another
of
the
navigations
on
which
telford
was
long
employed
was
that
of
the
river
weaver
in
cheshire
it
was
only
miles
in
extent
but
of
considerable
importance
to
the
country
through
which
it
passed
accommodating
the
districts
of
which
the
towns
of
nantwich
northwich
and
frodsham
are
the
centres
the
channel
of
the
river
was
extremely
crooked
and
much
obstructed
by
shoals
when
telford
took
the
navigation
in
hand
in
the
year
and
a
number
of
essential
improvements
were
made
in
it
by
means
of
new
locks
weirs
and
side
cuts
which
had
the
effect
of
greatly
improving
the
communications
of
these
important
districts
in
the
following
year
we
find
our
engineer
consulted
at
the
instance
of
the
king
of
sweden
on
the
best
mode
of
constructing
the
gotha
canal
between
lake
wenern
and
the
baltic
to
complete
the
communication
with
the
north
sea
in
at
the
invitation
of
count
platen
telford
visited
sweden
and
made
a
careful
survey
of
the
district
the
service
occupied
him
and
his
assistants
two
months
after
which
he
prepared
and
sent
in
a
series
of
detailed
plans
and
sections
together
with
an
elaborate
report
on
the
subject
his
plans
having
been
adopted
he
again
visited
sweden
in
to
inspect
the
excavations
which
had
already
been
begun
when
he
supplied
the
drawings
for
the
locks
and
bridges
with
the
sanction
of
the
british
government
he
at
the
same
time
furnished
the
swedish
contractors
with
patterns
of
the
most
improved
tools
used
in
canal
making
and
took
with
him
a
number
of
experienced
and
navvies
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
the
native
workmen
the
construction
of
the
gotha
canal
was
an
undertaking
of
great
magnitude
and
difficulty
similar
in
many
respects
to
the
caledonian
canal
though
much
more
extensive
the
length
of
artificial
canal
was
miles
and
of
the
whole
navigation
including
the
lakes
miles
the
locks
are
feet
long
and
feet
broad
the
width
of
the
canal
at
bottom
being
feet
and
the
depth
of
water
feet
the
results
so
far
as
the
engineer
was
concerned
were
much
more
satisfactory
than
in
the
case
of
the
caledonian
canal
while
in
the
one
case
he
had
much
obloquy
to
suffer
for
the
services
he
had
given
in
the
other
he
was
honoured
and
feted
as
a
public
benefactor
the
king
conferring
upon
him
the
swedish
order
of
knighthood
and
presenting
him
with
his
portrait
set
in
diamonds
among
the
various
canals
throughout
england
which
telford
was
employed
to
construct
or
improve
down
to
the
commencement
of
the
railway
era
were
the
gloucester
and
berkeley
canal
in
the
grand
trunk
canal
in
the
harecastle
tunnel
which
he
constructed
anew
in
the
birmingham
canal
in
and
the
macclesfield
and
birmingham
and
liverpool
junction
canals
in
the
gloucester
and
berkeley
canal
company
had
been
unable
to
finish
their
works
begun
some
thirty
years
before
but
with
the
assistance
of
a
loan
of
from
the
exchequer
bill
loan
commissioners
they
were
enabled
to
proceed
with
the
completion
of
their
undertaking
a
capacious
canal
was
cut
from
gloucester
to
sharpness
point
about
eight
miles
down
the
severn
which
had
the
effect
of
greatly
improving
the
convenience
of
the
port
of
gloucester
and
by
means
of
this
navigation
ships
of
large
burden
can
now
avoid
the
circuitous
and
difficult
passage
of
the
higher
part
of
the
river
very
much
to
the
advantage
of
the
trade
of
the
place
the
formation
of
a
new
tunnel
through
harecastle
hill
for
the
better
accommodation
of
the
boats
passing
along
the
grand
trunk
canal
was
a
formidable
work
the
original
tunnel
it
will
be
remembered
was
laid
out
by
brindley
about
fifty
years
before
and
occupied
eleven
years
in
construction
but
the
engineering
appliances
of
those
early
days
were
very
limited
the
pumping
powers
of
the
had
not
been
fairly
developed
and
workmen
were
as
yet
only
in
the
expert
use
of
tools
the
tunnel
no
doubt
answered
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
originally
intended
but
it
was
very
soon
found
too
limited
for
the
traffic
passing
along
the
navigation
it
was
little
larger
than
a
sewer
and
admitted
the
passage
of
only
one
narrow
boat
seven
feet
wide
at
a
time
involving
very
heavy
labour
on
the
part
of
the
men
who
worked
it
through
this
was
performed
by
what
was
called
legging
the
leggers
lay
upon
the
deck
of
the
vessel
or
upon
a
board
slightly
projecting
from
either
side
of
it
and
by
thrusting
their
feet
against
the
slimy
roof
or
sides
of
the
horizontally
as
it
were
they
contrived
to
push
it
through
but
it
was
no
better
than
horsework
and
after
legging
harecastle
tunnel
which
is
more
than
a
mile
and
a
half
long
the
men
were
usually
completely
exhausted
and
as
wet
from
perspiration
as
if
they
had
been
dragged
through
the
canal
itself
the
process
occupied
about
two
hours
and
by
the
time
the
passage
of
the
tunnel
was
made
there
was
usually
a
collection
of
boats
at
the
other
end
waiting
their
turn
to
pass
thus
much
contention
and
confusion
took
place
amongst
the
boatmen
a
very
rough
class
of
labourers
and
many
furious
battles
were
fought
by
the
claimants
for
the
first
turn
through
regulations
were
found
of
no
avail
to
settle
these
disputes
still
less
to
accommodate
the
large
traffic
which
continued
to
keep
flowing
along
the
line
of
the
grand
trunk
and
steadily
increased
with
the
advancing
trade
and
manufactures
of
the
country
loud
complaints
were
made
by
the
public
but
they
were
disregarded
for
many
years
and
it
was
not
until
the
proprietors
were
threatened
with
rival
canals
and
railroads
that
they
determined
on
what
they
could
no
longer
avoid
if
they
desired
to
retain
the
carrying
trade
of
the
district
the
enlargement
of
the
harecastle
tunnel
telford
was
requested
to
advise
the
company
what
course
was
most
proper
to
be
adopted
in
the
matter
and
after
examining
the
place
he
recommended
that
an
entirely
new
tunnel
should
be
constructed
nearly
parallel
with
the
old
one
but
of
much
larger
dimensions
the
work
was

was

to
point
out
that
the
much
greater
period
occupied
in
the
earlier
undertaking
is
not
to
be
set
down
to
the
disparagement
of

tunnel
is
in
so
perfectly
straight
a
line
that
its
whole

can
be
seen

though
it
was
constructed
by

fifteen

the
workmanship
is
so
perfect
that
the

of
the
various
lengths
of
brickwork
are
scarcely
discernible
the
convenience
afforded
by
the
new
tunnel
was
very
great
and
telford
mentions
that
on
surveying

in
he
asked
a
boatman

was

without

of
time
and
carried
out

to
the
advantage

it
so
happened

was
in

proved

an
illustration
of
the
tact
and
judgment
which
he
usually
displayed
in
laying
out
his
works
for
practical
uses
mr
telford
largely
employed
cast
iron
in
the
construction
of
this
canal
using
it
in
the
locks
and
gates
as
well
as
in
an
extensive
aqueduct

it
was
necessary
to
construct
over
a
deep
ravine
after
the
plan
pursued
by
him
at

other
places

constructed
by

on

telford

consulted
as
to
the
best
means
of
protecting
existing
investments
and
his
advice
was
to
render
the
canal
system
as
complete
as
it
could
be
made
for
he
entertained
the
conviction
which
has
been
justified
by
experience
that
such
navigations
possessed
peculiar
advantages
for
the
conveyance
of
heavy
goods
and
that
if
the
interruptions
presented
by
locks
could
be
done
away
with
or
materially
reduced
a
large
portion
of
the
trade
of
the
country
must
continue
to
be
carried
by
the
water

the
new
line
recommended
by
him
was
approved
and
adopted

the
works
were
commenced

a
second
complete
route

thus
opened
up
between
birmingham
and
liverpool

manchester

which
the
distance
was
shortened

the
delay
occasioned
by

of
upward

done
away

justly
proud
of
his

were
the
finest

kind

had
yet
been
executed
in

capacious
convenient
and
substantial
they
embodied
his
most
ingenious
contrivances
and
his
highest
engineering
skill
hence
we
find
him
writing
to
a
friend
at
langholm

so
soon
as
he
could
find
sufficient
leisure
from
his
various
avocations
in
his
own
unrivalled
and
beloved
island

was
his
intention
to
visit

the

had
been
able

accomplish

with

by
which
time
it
had
cost
about
a
million

or
double
the
original
estimate
notwithstanding
this
large
outlay
it
appears
that
the
canal
was
opened
before
the
works
had
been
properly
completed
and
the
consequence
was
that
they
very
shortly
fell
into
decay
it
even
began
to
be
considered
whether
the
canal
ought
not
to
be
abandoned

james
walker

engineer
of
the
highest
eminence
examined
it
and
reported
fully
on
its
then
state
strongly
recommending
its
completion
as
well
as
its
improvement
his
advice
was
eventually
adopted
and
the
canal
was
finished
accordingly
at
an
additional
cost
of
about

whole

was
in

be
made

as
the

increases
the

probably
become

shortening

down

render

by
the
main

improvement
of

telford
was
early
called
upon
to
advise
as
to
the
repairs
of
the
road
between
carlisle
and
glasgow
which
had
been
allowed
to
fall
into
a
wretched
state

as

new
line
from

across

although
glasgow
had
become
a
place
of
considerable
wealth
and
importance
the
roads
to
it
north
of
carlisle
continued
in
a
very
unsatisfactory
state
it
was
only
in
july
that
the
first
from
london
had
driven
into
glasgow
by
that
route
when
it
was
welcomed
by
a
procession
of
the
citizens
on
horseback
who
went
out
several
miles
to
meet
it
but
the
road
had
been
shockingly
made
and
before
long
had
become
almost
impassable
robert
owen
states
that
in
it
took
him
two
days
and
three
nights
incessant
travelling
to
get
from
manchester
to
glasgow
and
he
mentions
that
the
coach
had
to
cross
a
dangerous
mountain
at
midnight
called
erickstane
brae
which
was
then
always
passed
with
fear
and
trembling
as
late
as
the
year
we
find
a
parliamentary
committee
declaring
the
road
between
carlisle
and
glasgow
to
be
in
so
ruinous
a
state
as
often
seriously
to
delay
the
mail
and
endanger
the
lives
of
travellers
the
bridge
over
evan
water
was
so
much
decayed
that
one
day
the
coach
and
horses
fell
through
it
into
the
river
when
one
passenger
was
killed
the
coachman
survived
only
a
few
days
and
several
other
persons
were
dreadfully
maimed
two
of
the
horses
being
also
killed
the
remaining
part
of
the
bridge
continued
for
some
time
unrepaired
just
space
enough
being
left
for
a
single
carriage
to
pass
the
road
trustees
seemed
to
be
helpless
and
did
nothing
a
local
subscription
was
tried
and
failed
the
district
passed
through
being
very
poor
but
as
the
road
was
absolutely
required
for
more
than
merely
local
purposes
it
was
eventually
determined
to
undertake
its
reconstruction
as
a
work
of
national
importance
and
was
granted
by
parliament
with
this
object
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
passed
in
the
works
were
placed
under
telford
charge
and
an
admirable
road
was
very
shortly
under
construction
between
carlisle
and
glasgow
that
part
of
it
between
hamilton
and
glasgow
eleven
miles
in
length
was
however
left
in
the
hands
of
local
trustees
as
was
the
diversion
of
thirteen
miles
at
the
boundary
of
the
counties
of
lanark
and
dumfries
for
which
a
previous
act
had
been
obtained
the
length
of
new
line
constructed
by
telford
was
miles
and
it
was
probably
the
finest
piece
of
road
which
up
to
that
time
had
been
made
his
ordinary
method
of
in
the
highlands
was
first
to
level
and
drain
then
like
the
romans
to
lay
a
solid
pavement
of
large
stones
the
round
or
broad
end
downwards
as
close
as
they
could
be
set
the
points
of
the
latter
were
then
broken
off
and
a
layer
of
stones
broken
to
about
the
size
of
walnuts
was
laid
upon
them
and
over
all
a
little
gravel
if
at
hand
a
road
thus
formed
soon
became
bound
together
and
for
ordinary
purposes
was
very
durable
but
where
the
traffic
as
in
the
case
of
the
carlisle
and
glasgow
road
was
expected
to
be
very
heavy
telford
took
much
greater
pains
here
he
paid
especial
attention
to
two
points
first
to
lay
it
out
as
nearly
as
possible
upon
a
level
so
as
to
reduce
the
draught
to
horses
dragging
heavy
vehicles
one
in
thirty
being
about
the
severest
gradient
at
any
part
of
the
road
the
next
point
was
to
make
the
working
or
middle
portion
of
the
road
as
firm
and
substantial
as
possible
so
as
to
bear
without
shrinking
the
heaviest
weight
likely
to
be
brought
over
it
with
this
object
he
specified
that
the
metal
bed
was
to
be
formed
in
two
layers
rising
about
four
inches
towards
the
centre
the
bottom
course
being
of
stones
whinstone
limestone
or
hard
freestone
seven
inches
in
depth
these
were
to
be
carefully
set
by
hand
with
the
broadest
ends
downwards
all
crossbonded
or
jointed
no
stone
being
more
than
three
inches
wide
on
the
top
the
spaces
between
them
were
then
to
be
filled
up
with
smaller
stones
packed
by
hand
so
as
to
bring
the
whole
to
an
even
and
firm
surface
over
this
a
top
course
was
to
be
laid
seven
inches
in
depth
consisting
of
properly
broken
hard
whinstones
none
exceeding
six
ounces
in
weight
and
each
to
be
able
to
pass
through
a
circular
ring
two
inches
and
a
half
in
diameter
a
binding
of
gravel
about
an
inch
in
thickness
being
placed
over
all
a
drain
crossed
under
the
bed
of
the
bottom
layer
to
the
outside
ditch
in
every
hundred
yards
the
result
was
an
admirably
easy
firm
and
dry
road
capable
of
being
travelled
upon
in
all
weathers
and
standing
in
comparatively
small
need
of
repairs
a
similar
practice
was
introduced
in
england
about
the
same
time
by
macadam
and
though
his
method
was
not
so
thorough
as
that
of
telford
it
was
usefully
employed
on
most
of
the
high
roads
throughout
the
kingdom
macadam
notice
was
first
called
to
the
subject
while
acting
as
one
of
the
trustees
of
a
road
in
ayrshire
afterwards
while
employed
as
government
agent
for
victualling
the
navy
in
the
western
parts
of
england
he
continued
the
study
of
keeping
in
view
the
essential
conditions
of
a
compact
and
durable
substance
and
a
smooth
surface
at
that
time
the
attention
of
the
legislature
was
not
so
much
directed
to
the
proper
making
and
mending
of
the
roads
as
to
suiting
the
vehicles
to
them
such
as
they
were
and
they
legislated
backwards
and
forwards
for
nearly
half
a
century
as
to
the
breadth
of
wheels
macadam
was
on
the
other
hand
of
opinion
that
the
main
point
was
to
attend
to
the
nature
of
the
roads
on
which
the
vehicles
were
to
travel
most
roads
were
then
made
with
gravel
or
flints
tumbled
upon
them
in
their
natural
state
and
so
rounded
that
they
had
no
points
of
contact
and
rarely
became
consolidated
when
a
heavy
vehicle
of
any
sort
passed
over
them
their
loose
structure
presented
no
resistance
the
material
was
thus
completely
disturbed
and
they
often
became
almost
impassable
practice
was
this
to
break
the
stones
into
angular
fragments
so
that
a
bed
several
inches
in
depth
should
be
formed
the
material
best
adapted
for
the
purpose
being
fragments
of
granite
greenstone
or
basalt
to
watch
the
repairs
of
the
road
carefully
during
the
process
of
consolidation
filling
up
the
inequalities
caused
by
the
traffic
passing
over
it
until
a
hard
and
level
surface
had
been
obtained
thus
made
the
road
would
last
for
years
without
further
attention
in
macadam
devoted
himself
with
great
enthusiasm
to
as
a
profession
and
being
appointed
of
the
bristol
roads
he
had
full
opportunities
of
exemplifying
his
system
it
proved
so
successful
that
the
example
set
by
him
was
quickly
followed
over
the
entire
kingdom
even
the
streets
of
many
large
towns
were
macadamised
in
carrying
out
his
improvements
however
macadam
spent
several
thousand
pounds
of
his
own
money
and
in
having
proved
this
expenditure
before
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
the
amount
was
reimbursed
to
him
together
with
an
honorary
tribute
of
two
thousand
pounds
macadam
died
poor
but
as
he
himself
said
a
least
an
honest
man
by
his
indefatigable
exertions
and
his
success
as
a
by
greatly
saving
animal
labour
facilitating
commercial
intercourse
and
rendering
travelling
easy
and
expeditious
he
entitled
himself
to
the
reputation
of
a
public
benefactor
image
macadam
owing
to
the
mountainous
nature
of
the
country
through
which
telford
carlisle
and
glasgow
road
passes
the
bridges
are
unusually
numerous
and
of
large
dimensions
thus
the
burn
bridge
is
of
three
arches
one
of
and
two
of
feet
span
each
there
are
fourteen
other
bridges
presenting
from
one
to
three
arches
of
from
to
feet
span
but
the
most
picturesque
and
remarkable
bridge
constructed
by
telford
in
that
district
was
upon
another
line
of
road
subsequently
carried
out
by
him
in
the
upper
part
of
the
county
of
lanark
and
crossing
the
main
line
of
the
carlisle
and
glasgow
road
almost
at
right
angles
its
northern
and
eastern
part
formed
a
direct
line
of
communication
between
the
great
cattle
markets
of
falkirk
crief
and
doune
and
carlisle
and
the
west
of
england
it
was
carried
over
deep
ravines
by
several
lofty
bridges
the
most
formidable
of
which
was
that
across
the
mouse
water
at
cartland
crags
about
a
mile
to
the
west
of
lanark
the
stream
here
flows
through
a
deep
rocky
chasm
the
sides
of
which
are
in
some
places
about
four
hundred
feet
high
at
a
point
where
the
height
of
the
rocks
is
considerably
less
but
still
most
formidable
telford
spanned
the
ravine
with
the
beautiful
bridge
represented
in
the
engraving
facing
this
page
its
parapet
being
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
water
beneath
image
cartland
crags
bridge
the
reconstruction
of
the
western
road
from
carlisle
to
glasgow
which
telford
had
thus
satisfactorily
carried
out
shortly
led
to
similar
demands
from
the
population
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
kingdom
the
spirit
of
road
reform
was
now
fairly
on
foot
fast
coaches
and
of
all
kinds
had
become
greatly
improved
so
that
the
usual
rate
of
travelling
had
advanced
from
five
or
six
to
nine
or
ten
miles
an
hour
the
desire
for
the
rapid
communication
of
political
and
commercial
intelligence
was
found
to
increase
with
the
facilities
for
supplying
it
and
urged
by
the
public
wants
the
authorities
were
stimulated
to
unusual
efforts
in
this
direction
numerous
surveys
were
made
and
roads
laid
out
so
as
to
improve
the
main
line
of
communication
between
london
and
edinburgh
and
the
intermediate
towns
the
first
part
of
this
road
taken
in
hand
was
the
worst
that
lying
to
the
north
of
catterick
bridge
in
yorkshire
a
new
line
was
surveyed
by
west
auckland
to
hexham
passing
over
garter
fell
to
jedburgh
and
thence
to
edinburgh
but
was
rejected
as
too
crooked
and
uneven
another
was
tried
by
aldstone
moor
and
bewcastle
and
rejected
for
the
same
reason
the
third
line
proposed
was
eventually
adopted
as
the
best
passing
from
morpeth
by
wooler
and
coldstream
to
edinburgh
saving
rather
more
than
fourteen
miles
between
the
two
points
and
securing
a
line
of
road
of
much
more
favourable
gradients
the
principal
bridge
on
this
new
highway
was
at
pathhead
over
the
tyne
about
eleven
miles
south
of
edinburgh
to
maintain
the
level
so
as
to
avoid
the
winding
of
the
road
down
a
steep
descent
on
one
side
of
the
valley
and
up
an
equally
steep
ascent
on
the
other
telford
ran
out
a
lofty
embankment
from
both
sides
connecting
their
ends
by
means
of
a
spacious
bridge
the
structure
at
pathhead
is
of
five
arches
each
feet
span
with
feet
rise
from
their
springing
feet
above
the
bed
of
the
river
bridges
of
a
similar
character
were
also
thrown
over
the
deep
ravines
of
cranston
dean
and
cotty
burn
in
the
same
neighbourhood
at
the
same
time
a
useful
bridge
was
built
on
the
same
line
of
road
at
morpeth
in
northumberland
over
the
river
wansbeck
it
consisted
of
three
arches
of
which
the
centre
one
was
feet
span
and
two
feet
each
the
breadth
between
the
parapets
being
feet
the
advantages
derived
from
the
construction
of
these
new
roads
were
found
to
be
so
great
that
it
was
proposed
to
do
the
like
for
the
remainder
of
the
line
between
london
and
edinburgh
and
at
the
instance
of
the
authorities
with
the
sanction
of
the
treasury
telford
proceeded
to
make
detailed
surveys
of
an
entire
new
between
london
and
morpeth
in
laying
it
out
the
main
points
which
he
endeavoured
to
secure
were
directness
and
flatness
and
miles
of
the
proposed
new
great
north
road
south
of
york
were
laid
out
in
a
perfectly
straight
line
this
survey
which
was
begun
in
extended
over
several
years
and
all
the
requisite
arrangements
had
been
made
for
beginning
the
works
when
the
result
of
the
locomotive
competition
at
rainhill
in
had
the
effect
of
directing
attention
to
that
new
method
of
travelling
fortunately
in
time
to
prevent
what
would
have
proved
for
the
most
part
an
unnecessary
expenditure
on
works
soon
to
be
superseded
by
a
totally
different
order
of
things
the
most
important
actually
carried
out
under
telford
immediate
superintendence
were
those
on
the
western
side
of
the
island
with
the
object
of
shortening
the
distance
and
facilitating
the
communication
between
london
and
dublin
by
way
of
holyhead
as
well
as
between
london
and
liverpool
at
the
time
of
the
union
the
mode
of
transit
between
the
capital
of
ireland
and
the
metropolis
of
the
united
kingdom
was
tedious
difficult
and
full
of
peril
in
crossing
the
irish
sea
to
liverpool
the
packets
were
frequently
tossed
about
for
days
together
on
the
irish
side
there
was
scarcely
the
pretence
of
a
port
the
being
within
the
bar
of
the
river
liffey
inconvenient
at
all
times
and
in
rough
weather
extremely
dangerous
to
avoid
the
long
voyage
to
liverpool
the
passage
began
to
be
made
from
dublin
to
holyhead
the
nearest
point
of
the
welsh
coast
arrived
there
the
passengers
were
landed
upon
rugged
unprotected
rocks
without
a
pier
or
landing
convenience
of
any
kind
but
the
perils
were
not
at
an
end
comparatively
speaking
they
had
only
begun
from
holyhead
across
the
island
of
anglesea
there
was
no
made
road
but
only
a
miserable
track
circuitous
and
craggy
full
of
terrible
jolts
round
bogs
and
over
rocks
for
a
distance
of
miles
having
reached
the
menai
strait
the
passengers
had
again
to
take
to
an
open
before
they
could
gain
the
mainland
the
tide
ran
with
great
rapidity
through
the
strait
and
when
the
wind
blew
strong
the
boat
was
liable
to
be
driven
far
up
or
down
the
channel
and
was
sometimes
swamped
altogether
the
perils
of
the
welsh
roads
had
next
to
be
encountered
and
these
were
in
as
bad
a
condition
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
as
those
of
the
highlands
above
described
through
north
wales
they
were
rough
narrow
steep
and
unprotected
mostly
unfenced
and
in
winter
almost
impassable
the
whole
traffic
on
the
road
between
shrewsbury
and
bangor
was
conveyed
by
a
small
cart
which
passed
between
the
two
places
once
a
week
in
summer
as
an
illustration
of
the
state
of
the
roads
in
south
wales
which
were
quite
as
bad
as
those
in
the
north
we
may
state
that
in
when
the
late
lord
sudeley
took
home
his
bride
from
the
neighbourhood
of
welshpool
to
his
residence
only
thirteen
miles
distant
the
carriage
in
which
the
newly
married
pair
rode
stuck
in
a
quagmire
and
the
occupants
having
extricated
themselves
from
their
perilous
situation
performed
the
rest
of
their
journey
on
foot
the
first
step
taken
was
to
improve
the
on
both
the
irish
and
welsh
sides
of
george
channel
and
for
this
purpose
rennie
was
employed
in
the
result
was
that
howth
on
the
one
coast
and
holyhead
on
the
other
were
fixed
upon
as
the
most
eligible
sites
for
packet
stations
improvements
however
proceeded
slowly
and
it
was
not
until
that
a
sum
of
was
granted
by
parliament
to
enable
the
necessary
works
to
be
begun
attention
was
then
turned
to
the
state
of
the
roads
and
here
telford
services
were
called
into
requisition
as
early
as
it
had
been
determined
by
the
authorities
to
put
on
a
between
shrewsbury
and
holyhead
but
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
roads
in
north
wales
were
so
rough
and
dangerous
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
the
service
could
be
conducted
with
safety
attempts
were
made
to
enforce
the
law
with
reference
to
their
repair
and
no
less
than
townships
were
indicted
by
the
the
route
was
found
too
perilous
even
for
a
riding
post
the
legs
of
three
horses
having
been
broken
in
one
week
the
road
across
anglesea
was
quite
as
bad
sir
henry
parnell
mentioned
in
that
the
coach
had
been
overturned
beyond
gwynder
going
down
one
of
the
hills
when
a
friend
of
his
was
thrown
a
considerable
distance
from
the
roof
into
a
pool
of
water
near
the
of
gwynder
the
coachman
had
been
thrown
from
his
seat
by
a
violent
jolt
and
broken
his
leg
the
and
also
the
mail
had
been
overturned
at
the
bottom
of
penmyndd
hill
and
the
route
was
so
dangerous
that
the
london
coachmen
who
had
been
brought
down
to
work
the
country
refused
to
continue
the
duty
because
of
its
excessive
dangers
of
course
anything
like
a
regular
through
such
a
district
was
altogether
impracticable
the
indictments
of
the
townships
proved
of
no
use
the
localities
were
too
poor
to
provide
the
means
required
to
construct
a
line
of
road
sufficient
for
the
conveyance
of
mails
and
passengers
between
england
and
ireland
the
work
was
really
a
national
one
to
be
carried
out
at
the
national
cost
how
was
this
best
to
be
done
telford
recommended
that
the
old
road
between
shrewsbury
and
holyhead
miles
long
should
be
shortened
by
about
four
miles
and
made
as
nearly
as
possible
on
a
level
the
new
line
proceeding
from
shrewsbury
by
llangollen
corwen
and
bangor
to
holyhead
telford
also
proposed
to
cross
the
menai
strait
by
means
of
a
cast
iron
bridge
hereafter
to
be
described
although
a
complete
survey
was
made
in
nothing
was
done
for
several
years
the
continued
to
be
overturned
and
in
the
tourist
season
to
break
down
as
before
the
irish
took
forty
one
hours
to
reach
holyhead
from
the
time
of
its
setting
out
from
the
journey
was
performed
at
the
rate
of
only
miles
an
hour
the
mail
arriving
in
dublin
on
the
third
day
the
irish
members
made
many
complaints
of
the
delay
and
dangers
to
which
they
were
exposed
in
travelling
up
to
town
but
although
there
was
much
discussion
no
money
was
voted
until
the
year
when
sir
henry
parnell
vigorously
took
the
question
in
hand
and
successfully
carried
it
through
a
board
of
parliamentary
commissioners
was
appointed
of
which
he
was
chairman
and
under
their
direction
the
new
shrewsbury
and
holyhead
road
was
at
length
commenced
and
carried
to
completion
the
works
extending
over
a
period
of
about
fifteen
years
the
same
commissioners
excrcised
an
authority
over
the
roads
between
london
and
shrewsbury
and
numerous
improvements
were
also
made
in
the
main
line
at
various
points
with
the
object
of
facilitating
communication
between
london
and
liverpool
as
well
as
between
london
and
dublin
the
rugged
nature
of
the
country
through
which
the
new
road
passed
along
the
slopes
of
rocky
precipices
and
across
inlets
of
the
sea
rendered
it
necessary
to
build
many
bridges
to
form
many
embankments
and
cut
away
long
stretches
of
rock
in
order
to
secure
an
easy
and
commodious
route
the
line
of
the
valley
of
the
dee
to
the
west
of
llangollen
was
selected
the
road
proceeding
along
the
scarped
sides
of
the
mountains
crossing
from
point
to
point
by
lofty
embankments
where
necessary
and
taking
into
account
the
character
of
the
country
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
a
wonderfully
level
road
was
secured
while
the
gradients
on
the
old
road
had
in
some
cases
been
as
steep
as
in
passing
along
the
edge
of
unprotected
precipices
the
new
one
was
so
laid
out
as
to
be
no
more
than
in
at
any
part
while
it
was
wide
and
well
protected
along
its
whole
extent
telford
pursued
the
same
system
that
he
had
adopted
in
the
formation
of
the
carlisle
and
glasgow
road
as
regards
metalling
and
for
the
latter
purpose
using
schistus
or
slate
instead
of
sandstone
the
largest
bridges
were
of
iron
that
at
over
the
conway
called
the
waterloo
bridge
constructed
in
being
a
very
fine
specimen
of
telford
iron
those
parts
of
the
road
which
had
been
the
most
dangerous
were
taken
in
hand
first
and
by
the
year
the
route
had
been
rendered
comparatively
commodious
and
safe
angles
were
cut
off
the
sides
of
hills
were
blasted
away
and
several
heavy
embankments
run
out
across
formidable
arms
of
the
sea
thus
at
stanley

the

even
in

they
were
originally
designed

of
the
roads
constructed
by
telford

inaccessible
counties

was
the
theme
of
general
praise
and
their
superiority
compared
with
those
of
the
richer
and
more
level
districts
in
the
midland
and
western
english
counties
becoming
the
subject
of
public
comment
he
was
called
upon
to
execute
like
improvements
upon
that
part
of
the
which
extended
between
shrewsbury
and
the
metropolis
a
careful
survey
was
made
of
the
several
routes
from
london
northward
by
shrewsbury
as
far
as
liverpool
and
the
short
line
by
coventry
being
miles
from
london
to
shrewsbury
was
selected
as
the
one
to
be
improved
to
the
utmost
down
to
the
road
between
london
and
coventry
was
in
a
very
bad
state
being
so
laid
as
to
become
a
heavy
slough
in
wet
weather
there
were
many
steep
hills
which
required
to
be
cut
down
in
some
parts
of
deep
clay
in
others
of
deep
sand
a
had
been
tried
to
banbury
but
the
road
below
aylesbury
was
so
bad
that
the
authorities
were
obliged
to
give
it
up
the
twelve
miles
from
towcester
to
daventry
were
still
worse
the
line
of
way
was
covered
with
banks
of
dirt
in
winter
it
was
a
puddle
of
from
four
to
six
inches
deep
quite
as
bad
as
it
had
been
in
arthur
young
time
and
when
horses
passed
along
the
road
they
came
out
of
it
a
mass
of
mud
and
mire
there
were
also
several
steep
and
dangerous
hills
to
be
crossed
and
the
loss
of
horses
by
fatigue
in
travelling
by
that
route
at
the
time
was
very
great
even
the
roads
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
were
little
better
those
under
the
highgate
and
hampstead
trust
being
pronounced
in
a
wretched
state
they
were
badly
formed
on
a
clay
bottom
and
being
undrained
were
almost
always
wet
and
sloppy
the
gravel
was
usually
tumbled
on
and
spread
unbroken
so
that
the
materials
instead
of
becoming
consolidated
were
only
rolled
about
by
the
wheels
of
the
carriages
passing
over
them
telford
applied
the
same
methods
in
the
reconstruction
of
these
roads
that
he
had
already
adopted
in
scotland
and
wales
and
the
same
improvement
was
shortly
felt
in
the
more
easy
passage
over
them
of
vehicles
of
all
sorts
and
in
the
great
acceleration
of
the
mail
service
at
the
same
time
the
line
along
the
coast
from
bangor
by
conway
abergele
asaph
and
holywell
to
chester
was
greatly
improved
as
forming
the
mail
road
from
dublin
to
liverpool
it
was
considered
of
importance
to
render
it
as
safe
and
level
as
possible
the
principal
new
cuts
on
this
line
were
those
along
the
rugged
skirts
of
the
huge
around
the
base
of
to
the
town
of
conway
and
between
asaph
and
holywell
to
ease
the
ascent
of
rhyall
hill
but
more
important
than
all
as
a
means
of
completing
the
main
line
of
communication
between
england
and
ireland
there
were
the
great
bridges
over
the
conway
and
the
menai
straits
to
be
constructed
the
dangerous
ferries
at
those
places
had
still
to
be
crossed
in
open
boats
sometimes
in
the
night
when
the
luggage
and
mails
were
exposed
to
great
risks
sometimes
indeed
they
were
wholly
lost
and
passengers
were
lost
with
them
it
was
therefore
determined
after
long
consideration
to
erect
bridges
over
these
formidable
straits
and
telford
was
employed
to
execute
the
works
in
what
manner
we

to

the
erection
of
a
bridge
over
the
straits
had
long
been
matter
of
speculation
amongst
engineers
as
early
as
golborne
proposed
his
plan
of
an
embankment
with
a
bridge
in
the
middle
of
it
and
a
few
years
later
in
nichols
proposed
a
wooden
viaduct
furnished
with
drawbridges
at
cadnant
island
later
still
rennie
proposed
his
design
of
a
cast
iron
bridge
but
none
of
these
plans
were
carried
out
and
the
whole
subject
remained
in
abeyance
until
the
year
when
a
commission
was
appointed
to
inquire
and
report
as
to
the
state
of
the
roads
between
shrewsbury
chester
and
holyhead
the
result
was
that
telford
was
called
upon
to
report
as
to
the
most
effectual

of
bridging

thus
completing

image
telford
proposed
cast
iron
bridge
telford
submitted
alternative
plans
for
a
bridge
over
the
strait
one
at
the
swilly
rock
consisting
of
three
cast
iron
arches
of
feet
span
with
a
stone
arch
of
feet
span
between
each
two
iron
ones
to
resist
their
lateral
thrust
and
another
at
to
which
he
himself
attached
the
preference
consisting
of
a
single
cast
iron
arch
of
feet
span
the
crown
of
the
arch
to
be
feet
above
high
water
of
spring
tides
and
the
breadth
of
the
roadway
to
be
feet
the
principal
objection
taken
to
this
plan
by
engineers
generally
was
the
supposed
difficulty
of
erecting
a
proper
centering
to
support
the
arch
during
construction
and
the
mode
by
which
telford
proposed
to
overcome
this
may
be
cited
in
illustration
of
his
ready
ingenuity
in
overcoming
difficulties
he
proposed
to
suspend
the
centering
from
above
instead
of
supporting
it
from
below
in
the
usual
manner
a
contrivance
afterwards
revived
by
another
very
skilful
engineer
the
late
brunel
frames
feet
high
were
to
be
erected
on
the
top
of
the
abutments
and
on
these
strong
blocks
or
rollers
and
chains
were
to
be
fixed
by
means
of
which
and
by
the
aid
of
windlasses
and
other
mechanical
powers
each
separate
piece
of
centering
was
to
be
raised
into
and
suspended
in
its
proper
place
telford
regarded
this
method
of
constructing
centres
as
applicable
to
stone
as
well
as
to
iron
arches
and
indeed
it
is
applicable
as
brunel
held
to
the
building
of
the
arch
itself
image
proposed
plan
of
suspended
centering
telford
anticipated
that
if
the
method
recommended
by
him
were
successfully
adopted
on
the
large
scale
proposed
at
menai
all
difficulties
with
regard
to
carrying
bridges
over
deep
ravines
would
be
done
away
with
and
a
new
era
in
begun
for
this
and
other
reasons
but
chiefly
because
of
the
much
greater
durability
of
a
cast
iron
bridge
compared
with
the
suspension
bridge
afterwards
adopted
it
is
matter
of
regret
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
carry
out
this
novel
and
grand
design
it
was
however
again
objected
by
mariners
that
the
bridge
would
seriously
affect
if
not
destroy
the
navigation
of
the
strait
and
this
plan
like
rennie
was
eventually
rejected
several
years
passed
and
during
the
interval
telford
was
consulted
as
to
the
construction
of
a
bridge
over
runcorn
gap
on
the
mersey
above
liverpool
as
the
river
was
there
about
feet
wide
and
much
used
for
purposes
of
navigation
a
bridge
of
the
ordinary
construction
was
found
inapplicable
but
as
he
was
required
to
furnish
a
plan
of
the
most
suitable
structure
he
proceeded
to
consider
how
the
difficulties
of
the
case
were
to
be
met
the
only
practicable
plan
he
thought
was
a
bridge
constructed
on
the
principle
of
suspension
expedients
of
this
kind
had
long
been
employed
in
india
and
america
where
wide
rivers
were
crossed
by
means
of
bridges
formed
of
ropes
and
chains
and
even
in
this
country
a
suspension
bridge
though
of
a
very
rude
kind
had
long
been
in
use
near
middleton
on
the
tees
where
by
means
of
two
common
chains
stretched
across
the
river
upon
which
a
footway
of
boards
was
laid
the
colliers
were
enabled
to
pass
from
their
cottages
to
the
colliery
on
the
opposite
bank
captain
afterwards
sir
samuel
brown
took
out
a
patent
for
forming
suspension
bridges
in
but
it
appears
that
telford
attention
had
been
directed
to
the
subject
before
this
time
as
he
was
first
consulted
respecting
the
runcorn
bridge
in
the
year
when
he
proceeded
to
make
an
elaborate
series
of
experiments
on
the
tenacity
of
wrought
iron
bars
with
the
object
of
employing
this
material
in
his
proposed
structure
after
he
had
made
upwards
of
two
hundred
tests
of
malleable
iron
of
various
qualities
he
proceeded
to
prepare
his
design
of
a
bridge
which
consisted
of
a
central
opening
of
feet
span
and
two
side
openings
of
feet
each
supported
by
pyramids
of
masonry
placed
near
the
lines
the
roadway
was
to
be
feet
wide
divided
into
one
central
footway
and
two
distinct
carriageways
of
feet
each
at
the
same
time
he
prepared
and
submitted
a
model
of
the
central
opening
which
satisfactorily
stood
the
various
strains
which
were
applied
to
it
this
runcorn
design
of
was
of
a
very
magnificent
character
perhaps
superior
even
to
that
of
the
menai
suspension
bridge
afterwards
erected
but
unhappily
the
means
were
not
forthcoming
to
carry
it
into
effect
the
publication
of
his
plan
and
report
had
however
the
effect
of
directing
public
attention
to
the
construction
of
bridges
on
the
suspension
principle
and
many
were
shortly
after
designed
and
erected
by
telford
and
other
engineers
in
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
telford
continued
to
be
consulted
by
the
commissioners
of
the
holyhead
roads
as
to
the
completion
of
the
last
and
most
important
link
in
the
line
of
communication
between
london
and
holyhead
by
bridging
the
straits
of
menai
and
at
one
of
their
meetings
in
shortly
after
the
publication
of
his
runcorn
design
the
inquiry
was
made
whether
a
bridge
upon
the
same
principle
was
not
applicable
in
this
particular
case
the
engineer
was
instructed
again
to
examine
the
straits
and
submit
a
suitable
plan
and
estimate
which
he
proceeded
to
do
in
the
early
part
of
the
site
selected
by
him
as
the
most
favourable
was
that
which
had
been
previously
fixed
upon
for
the
projected
cast
iron
bridge
namely
at
the
shores
there
being
bold
and
rocky
affording
easy
access
and
excellent
foundations
while
by
spanning
the
entire
channel
between
the
lines
and
the
roadway
being
kept
uniformly
feet
above
the
highest
water
at
spring
tide
the
whole
of
the
navigable
waterway
would
be
left
entirely
uninterrupted
the
distance
between
the
centres
of
the
supporting
pyramids
was
proposed
to
be
of
the
then
unprecedented
width
of
feet
and
the
height
of
the
pyramids
feet
above
the
level
of
the
roadway
the
main
chains
were
to
be
sixteen
in
number
with
a
deflection
of
feet
each
composed
of
bars
of
iron
so
placed
as
to
give
a
square
of
six
on
each
side
making
the
whole
chain
about
four
inches
in
diameter
welded
together
for
their
whole
length
secured
by
bucklings
and
braced
round
with
iron
wire
while
the
ends
of
these
great
chains
were
to
be
secured
by
a
mass
of
masonry
built
over
stone
arches
between
each
end
of
the
supporting
piers
and
the
adjoining
shore
four
of
the
arches
were
to
be
on
the
anglesea
and
three
on
the
caernarvonshire
side
each
of
them
of
feet
inches

the
roadway
was
to
be
divided
as
in
the
runcorn
design
with
a
carriage
way
feet
wide
on
each
side
and
a
footpath
of
feet
in
the
middle
telford
plan
was
supported
by
rennie
and
other
engineers
of
eminence
and
the
select
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
being
satisfied
as
to
its
practicability
recommended
parliament
to
pass
a
bill
and
to
make
a
grant
of
money
to
enable
the
work
to
be
carried
into
effect

the
necessary
act
passed
in
the
session
of
and
telford
immediately
proceeded
to
bangor
to
make
preparations
for
beginning
the
works
the
first
proceeding
was
to
blast
off
the
inequalities
of
the
surface
of
the
rock
called
situated
on
the
western
or
holyhead
side
of
the
strait
at
that
time
accessible
only
at
low
water
the
object
was
to
form
an
even
surface
upon
it
for
the
foundation
of
the
west
main
pier
it
used
to
be
at
this
point
where
the
strait
was
narrowest
that
horned
cattle
were
driven
down
preparatory
to
swimming
them
across
the
channel
to
the
caernarvon
side
when
the
tide
was
weak
and
at
its
lowest
ebb
the
cattle
were
nevertheless
often
carried
away
the
current
being
too
strong
for
the
animals
to
contend
against
it
at
the
same
time
a
was
erected
on
which
was
connected
with
the
shore
by
an
embankment
carrying
lines
of
railway
along
these
horses
drew
the
sledges
laden
with
stone
required
for
the
work
the
material
being
brought
in
barges
from
the
quarries
opened
at
penmon
point
on
the
extremity
of
the
isle
of
anglesea
a
little
to
the
westward
of
the
northern
opening
of
the
strait
when
the
surface
of
the
rock
had
been
levelled
and
the
causeway
completed
the
first
stone
of
the
main
pier
was
laid
by
provis
the
resident
engineer
on
the
of
august
but
not
the
slightest
ceremony
was
observed
on
the
occasion
later
in
the
autumn
preparations
were
made
for
proceeding
with
the
foundations
of
the
eastern
main
pier
on
the
bangor
side
of
the
strait
after
excavating
the
beach
to
a
depth
of
feet
a
solid
mass
of
rock
was
reached
which
served
the
purpose
of
an
immoveable
foundation
for
the
pier
at
the
same
time
workshops
were
erected
builders
artisans
and
labourers
were
brought
together
from
distant
quarters
vessels
and
barges
were
purchased
or
built
for
the
special
purpose
of
the
work
a
quay
was
constructed
at
penmon
point
for
loading
the
stones
for
the
piers
and
all
the
requisite
preliminary
arrangements
were
made
for
proceeding
with
the
building
operations
in
the
ensuing
spring
a
careful
specification
of
the
masonry
work
was
drawn
up
and
the
contract
was
let
to
stapleton
and
hall
but
as
they
did
not
proceed
satisfactorily
and
desired
to
be
released
from
the
contract
it
was
relet
on
the
same
terms
to
john
wilson
one
of
principal
contractors
for
mason
work
on
the
caledonian
canal
the
building
operations
were
begun
with
great
vigour
early
in
the
three
arches
on
the
caernarvonshire
side
and
the
four
on
the
anglesea
side
were
first
proceeded
with
they
are
of
immense
magnitude
and
occupied
four
years
in
construction
having
been
finished
late
in
the
autumn
of
these
piers
are
feet
in
height
from
line
to
the
springing
of
the
arches
the
span
of
each
being
feet
inches
the
work
of
the
main
piers
also
made
satisfactory
progress
and
the
masonry
proceeded
so
rapidly
that
stones
could
scarcely
be
got
from
the
quarries
in
sufficient
quantity
to
keep
the
builders
at
work
by
the
end
of
june
about
three
hundred
men
were
employed
the
two
principal
piers
each
feet
in
height
upon
which
the
main
chains
of
the
bridge
were
to
be
suspended
were
built
with
great
care
and
under
rigorous
inspection
in
these
as
indeed
in
most
of
the
masonry
of
the
bridge
telford
adopted
the
same
practice
which
he
had
employed
in
his
previous
bridge
structures
that
of
leaving
large
void
spaces
commencing
above
high
water
mark
and
continuing
them
up
perpendicularly
nearly
to
the
level
of
the
roadway
i
have
elsewhere
expressed
my
conviction
he
says
when
referring
to
the
mode
of
constructing
these
piers
that
one
of
the
most
important
improvements
which
i
have
been
able
to
introduce
into
masonry
consists
in
the
preference
of
to
rubble
in
the
structure
of
a
pier
or
any
other
edifice
requiring
strength
every
stone
and
joint
in
such
walls
is
open
to
inspection
in
the
progress
of
the
work
and
even
afterwards
if
necessary
but
a
solid
filling
of
rubble
conceals
itself
and
may
be
little
better
than
a
heap
of
rubbish
confined
by
side
walls
the
walls
of
these
main
piers
were
built
from
within
as
well
as
from
without
all
the
way
up
and
the
inside
was
as
carefully
and
closely
cemented
with
mortar
as
the
external
face
thus
the
whole
pier
was
bound
firmly
together
and
the
utmost
strength
given
while
the
weight
of
the
superstructure
upon
the
lower
parts
of
the
work
was
reduced
to
its
minimum
image
section
of
main
pier
over
the
main
piers
the
small
arches
intended
for
the
roadways
were
constructed
each
being
feet
to
the
springing
of
the
arch
and
feet
wide
upon
these
arches
the
masonry
was
carried
upwards
in
a
tapering
form
to
a
height
of
feet
above
the
level
of
the
road
as
these
piers
were
to
carry
the
immense
weight
of
the
suspension
chains
great
pains
were
taken
with
their
construction
and
all
the
stones
from
top
to
bottom
were
firmly
bound
together
with
iron
dowels
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
their
being
separated
or
bulged
by
the
immense
pressure
they
had
to
withstand
the
most
important
point
in
the
execution
of
the
details
of
the
bridge
where
the
engineer
had
no
past
experience
to
guide
him
was
in
the
designing
and
fixing
of
the
wrought
iron
work
telford
had
continued
his
experiments
as
to
the
tenacity
of
bar
iron
until
he
had
obtained
several
hundred
distinct
tests
and
at
length
after
the
most
mature
delilberation
the
patterns
and
dimensions
were
finally
arranged
by
him
and
the
contract
for
the
manufacture
of
the
whole
was
let
to
hazeldean
of
shrewsbury
in
the
year
the
iron
was
to
be
of
the
best
shropshire
drawn
at
upton
forge
and
finished
and
proved
at
the
works
under
the
inspection
of
a

appointed

the
engineer
image

fixing
of
the

the
mode
by
which
the
land
ends
of
these
enormous
suspension
chains
were
rooted
to
the
solid
ground
on
either
side
of
the
strait
was
remarkably
ingenious
and
effective
three
oblique
tunnels
were
made
by
blasting
the
rock
on
the
anglesea
side
they
were
each
about
six
feet
in
diameter
the
excavations
being
carried
down
an
inclined
plane
to
the
depth
of
about
twenty
yards
a
considerable
width
of
rock
lay
between
each
tunnel
but
at
the
bottom
they
were
all
united
by
a
connecting
horizontal
avenue
or
cavern
sufficiently
capacious
to
enable
the
workmen
to
fix
the
strong
iron
frames
composed
principally
of
thick
flat
cast
iron
plates
which
were
engrafted
deeply
into
the
rock
and
strongly
bound
together
by
the
iron
work
passing
along
the
horizontal
avenue
so
that
if
the
iron
held
the
chains
could
only
yield
by
tearing
up
the
whole
mass
of
solid
rock
under
which
they
were
thus
firmly
bound
a
similar
method
of
anchoring
the
main
chains
was
adopted
on
the
caernarvonshire
side
a
thick
bank
of
earth
had
there
to
be
cut
through
and
a
solid
mass
of
masonry
built
in
its
place
the
rock
being
situated
at
a
greater
distance
from
the
main
pier
involving
a
greater
length
of
suspending
chain
and
a
disproportion
in
the
catenary
or
chord
line
on
that
side
of
the
bridge
the
excavation
and
masonry
thereby
rendered
necessary
proved
a
work
of
vast
labour
and
its
execution
occupied
a
considerable
time
but
by
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
suspension
pyramids
the
land
piers
and
arches
and
the
rock
tunnels
had
all
been
completed
and
the
main
chains
were
firmly
secured
in
them
the
work
being
sufficiently
advanced
to
enable
the
suspending
of
the
chains
to
be
proceeded
with
this
was
by
far
the
most
difficult
and
anxious
part
of
the
undertaking
with
the
same
careful
forethought
and
provision
for
every
contingency
which
had
distinguished
the
engineer
procedure
in
the
course
of
the
work
he
had
made
frequent
experiments
to
ascertain
the
actual
power
which
would
be
required
to
raise
the
main
chains
to
their
proper
curvature
a
valley

convenient
for
the
purpose
a
little
to
the
west
of
the
bridge
on
the
anglesea
side
of
the
intended
vertical
suspending
rods
each
nearly
ten
feet
long
and
an
inch
square
having
been
fastened
together
a
piece
of
chain
was
attached
to
one
end
to
make
the
chord
line
feet
in
length
and
experiments
having
been
made
and
comparisons
drawn
telford
ascertained
that
the
absolute
weight
of
one
of
the
main
chains
of
the
bridge
between
the
points
of
suspension
was
tons
requiring
a
strain
of
tons
to
raise
it
to
its
proper
curvature
on
this
calculation
the
necessary
apparatus
required
for
the
hoisting
was
prepared
the
mode
of
action
finally
determined
on
for
lifting
the
main
chains
and
fixing
them
into
their
places
was
to
build
the
central
portion
of
each
upon
a
raft
feet
long
and
feet
wide
then
to
float
it
to
the
site
of
the
bridge
and
lift
it
into
its
place
by
capstans
and
proper
tackle
at
length
all
was
ready
for
hoisting
the
first
great
chain
and
about
the
middle
of
april
telford
left
london
for
bangor
to
superintend
the
operations
an
immense
assemblage
collected
to
witness
the
sight
greater
in
number
than
any
that
had
been
collected
in
the
same
place
since
the
men
of
anglesea
in
their
rushing
down
to
the
beach
had
shrieked
defiance
across
the
straits
at
their
roman
invaders
on
the
caernarvon
shore
numerous
boats
arrayed
in
gay
colours
glided
along
the
waters
the
day
the
of
april
being
bright
calm
and
in
every
way
propitious
at
two
about
an
hour
before
high
water
the
raft
bearing
the
main
chain
was
cast
off
from
near
treborth
mill
on
the
caernarvon
side
towed
by
four
boats
it
began
gradually
to
move
from
the
shore
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
tide
which
caught
it
at
its
further
end
it
swung
slowly
and
majestically
round
to
its
position
between
the
main
piers
where
it
was
moored
one
end
of
the
chain
was
then
bolted
to
that
which
hung
down
the
face
of
the
caernarvon
pier
whilst
the
other
was
attached
to
ropes
connected
with
strong
capstans
fixed
on
the
anglesea
side
the
ropes
passing
by
means
of
blocks
over
the
top
of
the
pyramid
of
the
anglesea
pier
the
capstans
for
hauling
in
the
ropes
bearing
the
main
chain
were
two
in
number
manned
by
about
labourers
when
all
was
ready
the
signal
was
given
to
go
along
a
band
of
fifers
struck
up
a
lively
tune
the
capstans
were
instantly
in
motion
and
the
men
stepped
round
in
a
steady
trot
all
went
well
the
ropes
gradually
coiled
in
as
the
strain
increased
the
pace
slackened
a
little
but
heave
away
now
she
comes
was
sung
out
round
went
the
men
and
steadily
and
safely
rose
the
ponderous
chain
image

the
tide
had
by
this
time
turned
and
bearing
upon
the
side
of
the
raft
now
getting
freer
of
its
load
the
current
floated
it
away
from
under
the
middle
of
the
chain
still
resting
on
it
and
it
swung
easily
off
into
the
water
until
this
moment
a
breath
less
silence
pervaded
the
watching
multitude
and
nothing
was
heard
among
the
working
party
on
the
anglesea
side
but
the
steady
tramp
of
the
men
at
the
capstans
the
shrill
music
of
the
fife
and
the
occasional
order
to
hold
on
or
go
along
but
no
sooner
was
the
raft
seen
floating
away
and
the
great
chain
safely
swinging
in
the
air
than
a
tremendous
cheer
burst
forth
along
both
sides
of
the
straits
the
rest
of
the
work
was
only
a
matter
of
time
the
most
anxious
moment
had
passed
in
an
hour
and
minutes
after
the
commencement
of
the
hoisting
the
chain
was
raised
to
its
proper
curvature
and
fastened
to
the
land
portion
of
it
which
had
been
previously
placed
over
the
top
of
the
anglesea
pyramid
telford
ascended
to
the
point
of
fastening
and
satisfied
himself
that
a
continuous
and
safe
connection
had
been
formed
from
the
caernarvon
fastening
on
the
rock
to
that
on
anglesea
the
announcement
of
the
fact
was
followed
by
loud
and
prolonged
cheering
from
the
workmen
echoed
by
the
spectators
and
extending
along
the
straits
on
both
sides
until
it
seemed
to
die
away
along
the
shores
in
the
distance
three
foolhardy
workmen
excited
by
the
day
proceedings
had
the
temerity
to
scramble
along
the
upper
surface
of
the
chain
which
was
only
nine
inches
wide
and
formed
a
curvature
of
feet
from
one
side
of
the
strait
to
the
other
far
different
were
the
feelings
of
the
engineer
who
had
planned
this
magnificent
work
its
failure
had
been
predicted
and
like
brindley
barton
viaduct
it
had
been
freely
spoken
of
as
a
castle
in
the
air
telford
had
it
is
true
most
carefully
tested
every
part
by
repeated
experiment
and
so
conclusively
proved
the
sufficiency
of
the
iron
chains
to
bear
the
immense
weight
they
would
have
to
support
that
he
was
thoroughly
convinced
as
to
the
soundness
of
his
principles
of
construction
and
satisfied
that
if
rightly
manufactured
and
properly
put
together
the
chains
would
hold
and
that
the
piers
would
sustain
them
still
there
was
necessarily
an
element
of
uncertainty
in
the
undertaking
it
was
the
largest
structure
of
the
kind
that
had
ever
been
attempted
there
was
the
contingency
of
a
flaw
in
the
iron
some
possible
scamping
in
the
manufacture
some
little
point
which
in
the
multiplicity
of
details
to
be
attended
to
he
might
have
overlooked
or
which
his
subordinates
might
have
neglected
it
was
indeed
impossible
but
that
he
should
feel
intensely
anxious
as
to
the
result
of
the
operations
telford
afterwards
stated
to
a
friend
only
a
few
months
before
his
death
that
for
some
time
previous
to
the
opening
of
the
bridge
his
anxiety
was
so
great
that
he
could
scarcely
sleep
and
that
a
continuance
of
that
condition
must
have
very
soon
completely
undermined
his
health
we
are
not
therefore
surprised
to
learn
that
when
his
friends
rushed
to
congratulate
him
on
the
result
of
the
first
day
experiment
which
decisively
proved
the
strength
and
solidity
of
the
bridge

been
taken
off

the
perilous
enterprise
of
the

had
been
accomplished
without

spontaneous
act
was

shortly
after

it
was
determined
by
the
commissioners
of

that
a
bridge
of
similar
design
should
be
built
over
the
estuary
of
the

immediately
opposite
the
old
castle
at
that
place

which

observes
principle
of
suspending
and
laying
down
from
above
the
centering
of
stone
and
iron
bridges
is
we
think
a
much
more
fertile
one
than
even
he
himself
supposed
with
modifications
by
no
means
considerable
and
certainly
practicable
it
appears
to
us
that
the
voussoirs
or
archstones
might
themselves
be
laid
down
from
above
and
suspended
by
an
appropriate
mechanism
till
the
keystone
was
inserted
if
we
suppose
the
centering
in
telford

to
be
of
iron
this
centering
itself
becomes
an
iron
bridge
each
rib
of
which
is
composed
of
ten
pieces
of
fifty
feet
each
and
by
increasing
the
number
of
suspending
chains
these
separate
pieces
or
voussoirs
having
been
previously
joined
together
either
temporarily
or
permanently
by
cement
or
by
clamps
might
be
laid
into
their
place
and
kept
there
by
a
single
chain
till
the
road
was
completed
the
voussoirs
when
united
might
be
suspended
from
a
general
chain
across
the
archway
and
a
platform
could
be
added
to
facilitate
the
operations
this
is
as
nearly
as
possible
the
plan
afterwards
revived
by
brunel
and
for
the
originality
of
which
we
believe
he
has
generally
the
credit
though
it
clearly
belongs
to
telford

correspondent
informs
us
of
a
still
more
foolhardy
exploit
performed
on
the
occasion
he
says
having
been
present
as
a
boy
from
bangor
grammar
school
on
the
of
april
when
the
first
chain
was
carried
across
an
incident
occurred
which
made
no
small
impression
on
my
mind
at
the
time
after
the
chain
had
reached
its
position
a
cobbler
of
the
neighbourhood
crawled
to
the
centre
of
the
curve
and
there
finished
a
pair
of
shoes
when
having
completed
his
task
he
returned
in
safety
to

need
not

that

appreciated
his

we
have

indeed
exhibit
a
measure
of
the
vital
energy
which
has
from
time
to
time
existed
in
the
nation
in
the
earlier
periods
of
engineering
history
the
war
of
man
was
with
nature
the
sea
was
held
back
by
embankments
the
thames
instead
of
being
allowed
to
overspread
the
wide
marshes
on
either
bank
was
confined
within
limited
bounds
by
which
the
navigable
depth
of
its
channel
was
increased
at
the
same
time
that
a
wide
extent
of
land
was
rendered
available
for
agriculture
in
those
early
days
the
great
object
was
to
render
the
land
more
habitable
comfortable
and
productive
marshes
were
reclaimed
and
wastes
subdued
but
so
long
as
the
country
remained
comparatively
closed
against
communication
and
intercourse
was
restricted
by
the
want
of
bridges
and
roads
improvement
was
extremely
slow
for
while
roads
are
the
consequence
of
civilisation
they
are
also
among
its
most
influential
causes
we
have
seen
even
the
blind
metcalf
acting
as
an
effective
instrument
of
progress
in
the
northern
counties
by
the
formation
of
long
lines
of

and
the

carried
on

and
foreign
trade
he
was
followed
by
telford
whose
long
and
busy
life
as
we
have
seen
was
occupied
in
building
bridges
and
making
roads
in
all
directions
in
districts
of
the
country
formerly
inaccessible
and
therefore
comparatively
barbarous
at
length
the
wildest
districts
of
the
highlands
and
the
most
rugged
mountain
valleys
of
north
wales
were
rendered
as
easy
of
access
as
the
comparatively
level
counties
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
metropolis
during
all
this
while
the
wealth
and
industry
of
the
country
had
been
advancing
with
rapid
strides
london
had
grown
in
population
and
importance
many
improvements
had
been
effected
in
the
river
but
the
dock
accommodation
was
still
found
insufficient
and
as
the
recognised
head
of
his
profession
telford
though
now
grown
old
and
fast
becoming
infirm
was
called
upon
to
supply
the
requisite
plans
he
had
been
engaged
upon
great
works
for
upwards
of
thirty
years
previous
to
which
he
had
led
the
life
of
a
working
mason
but
he
had
been
a
steady
temperate
man
all
his
life
and
though
nearly
seventy
when
consulted
as
to
the
proposed
new
docks
his
mind
was
as
able
to
deal
with
the
subject
in
all
its
bearings
as
it
had
ever
been
and
he
undertook
the
work
in
a
new
company
was
formed
to
provide
a
dock
nearer
to
the
heart
of
the
city
than
any
of
the
existing
ones
the
site
selected
was
the
space
between
the
tower
and
the
london
docks
which
included
the
property
of
katherine
hospital
the
whole
extent
of
land
available
was
only
acres
of
a
very
irregular
figure
so
that
when
the
quays
and
warehouses
were
laid
out
it
was
found
that
only
about
ten
acres
remained
for
the
docks
but
these
from
the
nature
of
the
ground
presented
an
unusual
amount
of
quay
room
the
necessary
act
was
obtained
in
the
works
were
begun
in
the
following
year
and
on
the
of
october
the
new
docks
were
completed
and
opened
for
business
the
katherine
docks
communicate
with
the
river
by
means
of
an
entrance
feet
long
and
feet
wide
with
three
pairs
of
gates
admitting
either
one
very
large
or
two
small
vessels
at
a
time
the
and
the
sills
under
the
two
middle
were
fixed
at
the
depth
of
ten
feet
under
the
level
of
low
water
of
ordinary
spring
tides
the
formation
of
these
was
a
work
of
much
difficulty
demanding
great
skill
on
the
part
of
the
engineer
it
was
necessary
to
excavate
the
ground
to
a
great
depth
below
low
water
for
the
purpose
of
getting
in
the
foundations
and
the
cofferdams
were
therefore
of
great
strength
to
enable
them
when
pumped
out
by
the
to
resist
the
lateral
pressure
of
forty
feet
of
water
at
high
tide
the
difficulty
was
however
effectually
overcome
and
the
wharf
walls
locks
sills
and
bridges
of
the
katherine
docks
are
generally
regarded
as
a
of
harbour
construction
alluding
to
the
rapidity
with
which
the
works
were
completed
telford
says
seldom
indeed
never
within
my
knowledge
has
there
been
an
instance
of
an
undertaking
of
this
magnitude
in
a
very
confined
situation
having
been
perfected
in
so
short
a
time
but
as
a
practical
engineer
responsible
for
the
success
of
difficult
operations
i
must
be
allowed
to
protest
against
such
haste
pregnant
as
it
was
and
ever
will
be
with
risks
which
in
more
instances
than
one
severely
taxed
all
my
experience
and
skill
and
dangerously
involved
the
reputation
of
the
directors
as
well
as
of
their
engineer
among
the
remaining
bridges
executed
by
telford
towards
the
close
of
his
professional
career
may
be
mentioned
those
of
tewkesbury
and
gloucester
the
former
town
is
situated
on
the
severn
at
its
confluence
with
the
river
avon
about
eleven
miles
above
gloucester
the
surrounding
district
was
rich
and
populous
but
being
intersected
by
a
large
river
without
a
bridge
the
inhabitants
applied
to
parliament
for
powers
to
provide
so
necessary
a
convenience
the
design
first
proposed
by
a
local
architect
was
a
bridge
of
three
arches
but
telford
when
called
upon
to
advise
the
trustees
recommended
that
in
order
to
interrupt
the
navigation
as
little
as
possible
the
river
should
be
spanned
by
a
single
arch
and
he
submitted
a
design
of
such
a
character
which
was
approved
and
subsequently
erected
it
was
finished
and
opened
in
april
this
is
one
of
the
largest
as
well
as
most
graceful
of
numerous
cast
iron
bridges
it
has
a
single
span
of
feet
with
a
rise
of
only
feet
consisting
of
six
ribs
of
about
three
feet
three
inches
deep
the
spandrels
being
filled
in
with
light
diagonal
work
the
narrow
gothic
arches
in
the
masonry
of
the
abutments
give
the
bridge
a
very
light
and
graceful
appearance
at
the
same
time
that
they
afford
an
enlarged
passage
for
the
high
river
floods
the
bridge
at
gloucester
consists
of
one
large
stone
arch
of
feet
span
it
replaced
a
structure
of
great
antiquity
of
eight
arches
which
had
stood
for
about
years
the
roadway
over
it
was
very
narrow
and
the
number
of
piers
in
the
river
and
the
small
dimensions
of
the
arches
offered
considerable
obstruction
to
the
navigation
to
give
the
largest
amount
of
waterway
and
at
the
same
time
reduce
the
gradient
of
the
road
over
the
bridge
to
the
greatest
extent
telford
adopted
the
following
expedient
he
made
the
general
body
of
the
arch
an
ellipse
feet
on
the
and
feet
rise
while
the
voussoirs
or
external
archstones
being
in
the
form
of
a
segment
have
the
same
chord
with
only
feet
rise
this
complex
form
says
telford
converts
each
side
of
the
vault
of
the
arch
into
the
shape
of
the
entrance
of
a
pipe
to
suit
the
contracted
passage
of
a
fluid
thus
lessening
the
flat
surface
opposed
to
the
current
of
the
river
whenever
the
tide
or
upland
flood
rises
above
the
springing
of
the
middle
of
the
ellipse
that
being
at
four
feet
above
low
water
whereas
the
flood
of
rose
twenty
feet
above
low
water
of
an
ordinary
which
when
there
is
no
upland
flood
rises
only
eight
or
nine
feet

he
found

risen
up

had
extended
northward

until
in
its
further
progress
was
checked
by
the

running
along
the
back
of
the

the

of

was
determined
to
throw

telford
was
called
upon
to
supply
the
design
the
point
of
crossing
the

was
immediately
behind

which
stands
almost
upon

the
sides
being
bold

the
situation
was

but
the
most
important
as
it
was
the
last
of
telford
stone
bridges
was
that
erected
across
the
clyde
at
the
broomielaw
glasgow
little
more
than
fifty
years
since
the
banks
of
the
river
at
that
place
were
literally
covered
with
broom
and
hence
its
name
while
the
stream
was
scarcely
deep
enough
to
float
a

frequented
by

the
largest

bustling

skill
and
enterprise
have
deepened
the

dredged
away
its
shoals
built
quays
and
wharves
along
its
banks
and
rendered
it
one
of
the
busiest
streams
in
the
world
it
has
become
a
great
river
thoroughfare
worked
by
steam
on
its
waters
the
first
steamboat
ever
constructed
for
purposes
of
traffic
in
europe
was
launched
by
henry
bell
in
and
the
clyde
boats
to
this
day
enjoy
the
highest
prestige
the
deepening
of
the
river
at
the
broomielaw
had
led
to
a
gradual
undermining
of
the
foundations
of
the
old
bridge
which
was
situated
close
to
the
principal
a
little
above
it
was
an
ancient
overfall
weir
which
had
also
contributed
to
scour
away
the
foundations
of
the
piers
besides
the
bridge
was
felt
to
be
narrow
inconvenient
and
for
accommodating
the
immense
traffic
passing
across
the
clyde
at
that
point
it
was
therefore
determined
to
take
down
the
old
structure
and
build
a
new
one
and
telford
was
called
upon
to
supply
the
design
the
foundation
was
laid
with
great
ceremony
on
the
of
march
and
the
new
bridge
was
completed
and
opened
on
the
of
january
rather
more
than
a
year
after
the
engineer
death
it
is

glasgow

like
most
previous
engineers
of
eminence
like
perry
brindley
smeaton
and
rennie
telford
was
in
the
course
of
his
life
extensively
employed
in
the
drainage
of
the
fen
districts
he
had
been
jointly
concerned
with
rennie
in
carrying
out
the
important
works
of
the
eau
brink
cut
and
at
rennie
death
he
succeeded
to
much
of
his
practice
as
consulting
engineer
it
was
principally
in
designing
and
carrying
out
the
drainage
of
the
north
level
that
telford
distinguished
himself
in
fen
drainage
the
north
level
includes
all
that
part
of
the
great
bedford
level
situated
between
morton
leam
and
the
river
welland
comprising
about
acres
of
land
the
river
nene
which
brings
down
from
the
interior
the
rainfall
of
almost
the
entire
county
of
northampton
flows
through
nearly
the
centre
of
the
district
in
some
places
the
stream
is
confined
by
embankments
in
others
it
flows
along
artificial
outs
until
it
enters
the
great
estuary
of
the
wash
about
five
miles
below
wisbeach
this
town
is
situated
on
another
river
which
flows
through
the
level
called
the
old
nene
below
the
point
of
junction
of
these
rivers
with
the
wash
and
still
more
to
seaward
was
south
holland
sluice
through
which
the
waters
of
the
south
holland
drain
entered
the
estuary
at
that
point
a
great
mass
of
silt
had
accumulated
which
tended
to
choke
up
the
mouths
of
the
rivers
further
inland
rendering
their
navigation
difficult
and
precarious
and
seriously
interrupting
the
drainage
of
the
whole
lowland
district
traversed
by
both
the
old
and
new
nene
indeed
the
sands
were
accumulating
at
such
a
rate
that
the
outfall
of
the
wisbeach
river
threatened
to
become
completely
destroyed
such
being
the
state
of
things
it
was
determined
to
take
the
opinion
of
some
eminent
engineer
and
rennie
was
employed
to
survey
the
district
and
recommend
a
measure
for
the
remedy
of
these
great
evils
he
performed
this
service
in
his
usually
careful
and
masterly
manner
but
as
the
method
which
he
proposed
complete
though
it
was
would
have
seriously
interfered
with
the
trade
of
wisbeach
by
leaving
it
out
of
the
line
of
navigation
and
drainage
which
he
proposed
to
open
up
the
corporation
of
that
town
determined
to
employ
another
engineer
and
mr
telford
was
selected
to
examine
and
report
upon
the
whole
subject
keeping
in
view
the
improvement
of
the
river
immediately
adjacent
to
the
town
of
wisbeach
telford
confirmed
rennie
views
to
a
large
extent
more
especially
with
reference
to
the
construction
of
an
entirely
new
outfall
by
making
an
artificial
channel
from
kindersleys
cut
to
eye
anchorage
by
which
a
level
lower
by
nearly
twelve
feet
would
be
secured
for
the
outfall
waters
but
he
preferred
leaving
the
river
open
to
the
tide
as
high
as
wisbeach
rather
than
place
a
lock
with
at
lutton
leam
sluice
as
had
been
proposed
by
rennie
he
also
suggested
that
the
acute
angle
at
the
horseshoe
be
cut
off
and
the
river
deepened
up
to
the
bridge
at
wisbeach
making
a
new
cut
along
the
bank
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
which
should
join
the
river
again
immediately
above
it
thereby
converting
the
intermediate
space
by
and
the
usual
contrivances
into
a
floating
dock
though
this
plan
was
approved
by
the
parties
interested
in
the
drainage
to
great
mortification
it
was
opposed
by
the
corporation
of
wisbeach
and
like
so
many
other
excellent
schemes
for
the
improvement
of
the
fen
districts
it
eventually
fell
to
the
ground
the
cutting
of
a
new
outfall
for
the
river
nene
however
could
not
much
longer
be
delayed
without
great
danger
to
the
reclaimed
lands
of
the
north
level
which
but
for
some
relief
of
the
kind
must
shortly
have
become
submerged
and
reduced
to
their
original
waste
condition
the
subject
was
revived
in
and
telford
was
again
called
upon
in
conjunction
with
sir
john
rennie
whose
father
had
died
in
the
preceding
year
to
submit
a
plan
of
a
new
nene
outfall
but
it
was
not
until
the
year
that
the
necessary
act
was
obtained
and
then
only
with
great
difficulty
and
cost
in
consequence
of
the
opposition
of
the
town
of
wisbeach
the
works
consisted
principally
of
a
deep
cut
or
canal
about
six
miles
in
length
penetrating
far
through
the
sand
banks
into
the
deep
waters
of
the
wash
they
were
begun
in
and
brought
to
completion
in
with
the
most
satisfactory
results
a
greatly
improved
outfall
was
secured
by
thus
carrying
the
mouths
of
the
rivers
out
to
sea
and
the
drainage
of
the
important
agricultural
districts
through
which
the
nene
flows
was
greatly
benefited
while
at
the
same
time
nearly
acres
of
valuable
land
were
added
to
the
county
of
lincoln
but
the
opening
of
the
nene
outfall
was
only
the
first
of
a
series
of
improvements
which
eventually
included
the
whole
of
the
valuable
lands
of
the
north
level
in
the
district
situated
between
the
nene
and
the
welland
the
opening
at
gunthorpe
sluice
which
was
the
outfall
for
the
waters
of
the
holland
drain
was
not
less
than
eleven
feet
three
inches
above
low
water
at
and
it
was
therefore
obvious
that
by
lowering
this
opening
a
vastly
improved
drainage
of
the
whole
of
the
level
district
extending
from
twenty
to
thirty
miles
inland
for
which
that
sluice
was
the
artificial
outlet
would
immediately
be
secured
urged
by
telford
an
act
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
requisite
improvement
was
obtained
in
and
the
excavations
having
been
begun
shortly
after
were
completed
in
a
new
cut
was
made
from
clow
cross
to
gunthorpe
sluice
in
place
of
the
winding
course
of
the
old
shire
drain
besides
which
a
bridge
was
erected
at
cross
keys
or
sutton
wash
and
an
embankment
was
made
across
the
salt
marshes
forming
a
high
road
which
with
the
bridges
previously
erected
at
fossdyke
and
lynn
effectually
connected
the
counties
of
norfolk
and
lincoln
the
result
of
the
improved
outfall
was
what
the
engineer
had
predicted
a
thorough
natural
drainage
was
secured
for
an
extensive
district
embracing
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
acres
of
fertile
land
which
had
before
been
very
ineffectually
though
expensively
cleared
of
the
surplus
water
by
means
of
windmills
and
the
productiveness
of
the
soil
was
greatly
increased
and
the
health
and
comfort
of
the
inhabitants
promoted
to
an
extent
that
surpassed
all
previous
expectation
the
whole
of
the
new
cuts
were
easily
navigable
being
from
to
feet
wide
at
bottom
whereas
the
old
outlets
had
been
variable
and
were
often
choked
with
shifting
sand
the
district
was
thus
effectually
opened
up
for
navigation
and
a
convenient
transit
afforded
for
coals
and
other
articles
of
consumption
wisbeach
became
accessible
to
vessels
of
much
larger
burden
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
after
the
construction
of
the
nene
outfall
the
trade
of
the
port
had
more
than
doubled
telford
himself
towards
the
close
of
his
life
spoke
with
natural
pride
of
the
improvements
which
he
had
thus
been
in
so
great
a
measure
instrumental
in
carrying
out
and
which
had
so
materially
promoted
the
comfort
prosperity
and
welfare
of
a
very
extensive
district
we
may
mention
as
a
remarkable
effect
of
the
opening
of
the
new
outfall
that
in
a
few
hours
the
lowering
of
the
waters
was
felt
throughout
the
whole
of
the
fen
level
the
sluggish
and
stagnant
drains
cuts
and
leams
in
far
distant
places
began
actually
to
flow
and
the
sensation
created
was
such
that
at
thorney
near
peterborough
some
fifteen
miles
from
the
sea
the
intelligence
penetrated
even
to
the
congregation
then
sitting
in
church
for
it
was
sunday
morning
that
the
waters
were
running
when
immediately
the
whole
flocked
out
parson
and
all
to
see
the
great
sight
and
acknowledge
the
blessings
of
science
a
humble
fen
poet
of
the
last
century
thus
quaintly
predicted
the
moral
results
likely
to
arise
from
the
improved
drainage
of
his
native
district
with
a
change
of
elements
suddenly
there
shall
a
change
of
men
and
manners
be
hearts
thick
and
tough
as
hides
shall
feel
remorse
and
souls
of
sedge
shall
understand
discourse
new
hands
shall
learn
to
work
forget
to
steal
new
legs
shall
go
to
church
new
knees
to
kneel
the
prophecy
has
indeed
been
fulfilled
the
barbarous
race
of
has
disappeared
before
the
skill
of
the
engineer
as
the
land
has
been
drained
the
fowlers
and
have
subsided
into
the
ranks
of
steady
industry

farmers
traders
and
labourers
the
plough
has
passed
over
the
bed
of
holland
fen
and
the
agriculturist
reaps
his
increase
more
than
a
hundred
wide
watery
wastes
formerly
abounding
in
fish
are
now
covered
with
waving
crops
of
corn
every
summer

since
the
silence
of

waste
was
only
disturbed
by
the
croaking
of
frogs
and
the
screaming
of
wild
fowl
all
this
has
been
the
result
of
the
science
of
the

enterprise
of

were
in
active
progress
and
the

lost
no
time
in
taking
his

them
southey
account
is
as
follows
before
breakfast
i
went
with
telford
to
the
harbour
to
look
at
his
works
which
are
of
great
magnitude
and
importance
a
huge
floating
dock
and
the
finest
graving
dock
i
ever
saw
the
town
expends
on
these
improvements

will
be
completed
in
another

what
they
take
from
the

serves
to
raise

was
formerly
covered

will
now
be
of
the
greatest
value

yards
the
local
authorities
originally
proposed
to
build
fifteen
piers
but
telford
assured
them
that
three
would
be
sufficient
and
in
telling
me
this
he
said
the
creation
of
fifteen
new
scotch
peers
was
too
strong
a
measure
telford
is
a
happy
life
everywhere
making
roads
building
bridges
forming
canals
and
creating
harbours
works
of
sure
solid
permanent
utility
everywhere
employing
a
great
number
of
persons
selecting
the
most
meritorious
and
putting
them
forward

are

the
management
of
the
commissioners
he
travels
on
horseback
not
less
than
miles
a
year
telford
found
him
in
the
situation
of
a
working
mason
who
could
scarcely
read
or
write
but
noticing
him
for
his
good
conduct
his
activity
and
his
firm
steady
character
he
has
brought
him
forward
and
mitchell
now
holds
a
post
of
respectability
and
importance
and
performs
his
business
with
excellent
ability
after
inspecting
the
little
harbour
of
bervie
one
of
the
first
works
of
the
kind
executed
by
telford
for
the
commissioners
the
party
proceeded
by
stonehaven
and
from
thence
along
the
coast
to
aberdeen
here
the
harbour
works
were
visited
and
admired
the
quay
says
southey
is
very
fine
and
telford
has
carried
out
his
pier
feet
beyond
the
point
where
smeaton
terminated
this
great
work
which
has
cost
protects
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
from
the
whole
force
of
the
north
sea
a
ship
was
entering
it
at
the
time
of
our
visit
the
prince
of
waterloo
she
had
been
to
america
had
discharged
her
cargo
at
london
and
we
now
saw
her
reach
her
own
port
in
safety
a
joyous
and
delightful
sight
the
next
point
reached
was
banff
along
the
don
and
the
line
of
the
inverury
canal
the
approach
to
banff
is
very
fine
says
southey
by
the
earl
of
fife

where
the
trees
are
surprisingly
grown
considering
how
near
they
are

square
odd
and

unhandsome

forty
years
ago

arches
by

as
we
had
hitherto
seen
it
grey
under
a
leaden
sky
but
bright
and
blue
in
the
sunshine
banff
on
the
left
of
the
bay
the
river
doveran
almost
lost
amid
banks
of
shingle
where
it
enters
the
sea
a
white
and
tolerably
high
shore
extending
eastwards
a
kirk
with
a
high
spire
which
serves
as
a
and
on
the
point
about
a
mile
to
the
east
the
town
of
macduff
at
banff
we
at
once
went
to
the
pier
about
half
finished
on
which
will
be
expended
to
the
great
benefit
of
this
clean
cheerful
and
active
little
town
the
pier
was
a
busy
scene
going
to
and
fro
over
the
railroads
cranes
at
work
charging
and
discharging
plenty
of
workmen
and
fine
masses
of
red
granite
from
the
peterhead
quarries
the
quay
was
almost
covered
with
barrels
of
herrings
which
women
were
busily
employed
in
salting
and
packing
the
next
visit
was
paid
to
the
harbour
works
at
cullen
which
were
sufficiently
advanced
to
afford
improved
shelter
for
the
fishing
vessels
of
the
little
port
when
i
stood
upon
the
pier
at
low
water
says
southey
seeing
the
tremendous
rocks
with
which
the
whole
shore
is
bristled
and
the
open
sea
to
which
the
place
is
exposed
it
was
with
a
proud
feeling
that
i
saw
the
first
talents
in
the
world
employed
by
the
british
government
in
works
of
such
unostentatious
but
great
immediate
palpable
and
permanent
utility
already
their
excellent
effects
are
felt
the
fishing
vessels
were
just
coming
in
having
caught
about
barrels
of
herrings
during
the
night
however
the
forfeited
estates
fund
may
have
been
misapplied
in
past
times
the
remainder
could
not
be
better
invested
than
in
these
great
improvements
wherever
a
pier
is
needed
if
the
people
or
the
proprietors
of
the
place
will
raise
the
necessary
funds
government
supplies
the
other
half
on
these
terms
are
expending
at
peterhead
and
at
frazerburgh
and
the
works
which
we
visited
at
bervie
and
banff
and
many
other
such
along
this
coast
would
never
have
been
undertaken
without
such
aid
public
liberality
thus
inducing
private
persons
to
tax
themselves
heavily
and
expend
with
a
good
will
much
larger
sums
than
could
have
been
drawn
from
them
by
taxation
from
cullen
the
travellers
proceeded
in
gigs
to
fochabers
thence
by
craigellachie
bridge
which
southey
greatly
admired
along
speyside
to
ballindalloch
and
inverallen
where
telford
new
road
was
in
course
of
construction
across
the
moors
towards
forres
the
country
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
was
a
wild
waste
nothing
but
mountains
and
heather
to
be
seen
yet
the
road
was
as
perfectly
made
and
maintained
as
if
it
had
lain
through
a
very
goschen
the
next
stages
were
to
nairn
and
inverness
from
whence
then
proceeded
to
view
the
important
works
constructed
at
the
crossing
of
the
river
beauly
at
lovat
bridge
says
southey
we
turned
aside
and
went
four
miles
up
the
river
along
the
strathglass
road
one
of
the
new
works
and
one
of
the
most
remarkable
because
of
the
difficulty
of
constructing
it
and
also
because
of
the
fine
scenery
which
it
commands
lovat
bridge
by
which
we
returned
is
a
plain
handsome
structure
of
five
arches
two
of
feet
span
two
of
and
the
centre
one
of
the
curve
is
as
little
as
possible
i
learnt
in
spain
to
admire
straight
bridges
but
telford
thinks
there
always
ought
to
be
some
curve
to
enable
the
rain
water
to
run
off
and
because
he
would
have
the
outline
look
like
the
segment
of
a
large
circle
resting
on
the
abutments
a
double
line
over
the
arches
gives
a
finish
to
the
bridge
and
perhaps
looks
as
well
or
almost
as
well
as
balustrades
for
not
a
sixpence
has
been
allowed
for
ornament
on
these
works
the
sides
are
protected
by
which
are
embankments
of
stone
to
prevent
the
floods
from
extending
on
either
side
and
attacking
the
flanks
of
the
bridge
nine
miles
further
north
they
arrived
at
dingwall
near
which
a
bridge
similar
to
that
at
beauly
though
wider
had
been
constructed
over
the
conan
from
thence
they
proceeded
to
invergordon
to
ballintraed
where
another
pier
for
fishing
boats
was
in
progress
to
tain
and
thence
to
bonar
bridge
over
the
sheir
miles
above
the
entrance
to
the
dornoch
frith
where
an
iron
bridge
after
the
same
model
as
that
of
craigellachie
had
been
erected
this
bridge
is
of
great
importance
connecting
as
it
does
the
whole
of
the
road
traffic
of
the
northern
counties
with
the
south
southey
speaks
of
it
as
a
work
of
such
paramount
utility
that
it
is
not
possible
to
look
at
it
without
delight
a
remarkable
anecdote
he
continues
was
told
me
concerning
it
an
inhabitant
of
sutherland
whose
father
was
drowned
at
the
mickle
ferry
some
miles
below
the
bridge
in
could
never
bear
to
set
foot
in
a
after
the
catastrophe
and
was
consequently
cut
off
from
communication
with
the
south
until
this
bridge
was
built
he
then
set
out
on
a
journey
i
went
along
the
road
by
the
side
of
the
water
said
he
could
see
no
bridge
at
last
i
came
in
sight
of
something
like
a
spider
web
in
the
air
if
this
be
it
thought
i
it
will
never
do
but
presently
i
came
upon
it
and
oh
it
is
the
finest
thing
that
ever
was
made
by
god
or
man
sixteen
miles
of
bonar
bridge
southey
crossed
fleet
mound
another
ingenious
work
of
his
friend
telford
but
of
an
altogether
different
character
it
was
thrown
across
the
river
fleet
at
the
point
at
which
it
ran
into
the
estuary
or
little
bay
outside
known
as
loch
fleet
at
this
point
there
had
formerly
been
a
ford
but
as
the
tide
ran
far
inland
it
could
only
be
crossed
at
low
water
and
travellers
had
often
to
wait
for
hours
before
they
could
proceed
on
their
journey
the
embouchure
being
too
wide
for
a
bridge
telford
formed
an
embankment
across
it
yards
in
length
providing
four
each
feet
wide
at
its
north
end
for
the
egress
of
the
inland
waters
these
gates
opened
outwards
and
they
were
so
hung
as
to
shut
with
the
rising
of
the
tide
the
holding
back
of
the
sea
from
the
land
inside
the
mound
by
this
means
had
the
effect
of
reclaiming
a
considerable
extent
of
fertile
carse
land
which
at
the
time
of
southey
visit
though
the
work
had
only
been
completed
the
year
before
was
already
under
profitable
cultivation
the
principal
use
of
the
mound
however
was
in
giving
support
to
the
fine
broad
road
which
ran
along
its
summit
and
thus
completed
the
communication
with
the
country
to
the
north
southey
speaks
in
terms
of
high
admiration
of
the
simplicity
the
beauty
and
utility
of
this
great
work
this
was
the
furthest
limit
of
their
journey
and
the
travellers
retraced
their
steps
southward
halting
at
clashmore
inn
at
breakfast
says
southey
was
a
handsome
set
of
worcester
china
upon
noticing
it
to
telford
he
told
me
that
before
these
roads
were
made
he
fell
in
with
some
people
from
worcestershire
near
the
ord
of
caithness
on
their
way
northward
with
a
cart
load
of
crockery
which
they
got
over
the
mountains
as
best
they
could
and
when
they
had
sold
all
their
ware
they
laid
out
the
money
in
black
cattle
which
they
then
drove
to
the
south
the
rest
of
southey
journal
is
mainly
occupied
with
a
description
of
the
scenery
of
the
caledonian
canal
and
the
principal
difficulties
encountered
in
the
execution
of
the
works
which
were
still
in
active
progress
he
was
greatly
struck
with
the
flight
of
locks
at
the
south
end
of
the
canal
where
it
enters
loch
eil
near
corpach
there
being
no
pier
yet
formed
he
says
we
were
carried
to
and
from
the
boats
on
men
shoulders
we
landed
close
to
the
sea
shore
a
sloop
was
lying
in
the
fine
basin
above
and
the
canal
was
full
as
far
as
the
staircase
a
name
given
to
the
eight
successive
locks
six
of
these
were
full
and
overflowing
and
then
we
drew
near
enough
to
see
persons
walking
over
the
it
had
more
the
effect
of
a
scene
in
a
pantomime
than
of
anything
in
real
life
the
rise
from
lock
to
lock
is
eight
feet
therefore
in
all
the
length
of
the
locks
including
the
gates
and
abutments
at
both
ends
is
yards
the
greatest
piece
of
such
masonry
in
the
world
and
the
greatest
work
of
the
kind
beyond
all
comparison
a
panorama
painted
from
this
place
would
include
the
highest
mountain
in
great
britain
and
its
greatest
work
of
art
that
work
is
one
of
which
the
magnitude
and
importance
become
apparent
when
considered
in
relation
to
natural
objects
the
pyramids
would
appear
insignificant
in
such
a
situation
for
in
them
we
should
perceive
only
a
vain
attempt
to
vie
with
greater
things
but
here
we
see
the
powers
of
nature
brought
to
act
upon
a
great
scale
in
subservience
to
the
purposes
of
men
one
river
created
another
and
that
a
huge
shouldered
out
of
its
place
and
art
and
order
assuming
a
character
of
sublimity
sometimes
a
beck
is
conducted
under
the
canal
and
passages
called
culverts
serve
as
a
roadway
for
men
and
beasts
we
walked
through
one
of
these
just
lofty
enough
for
a
man
of
my
stature
to
pass
through
with
his
hat
on
it
had
a
very
singular
effect
to
see
persons
emerging
from
this
dark
long
narrow
vault
sometimes
a
brook
is
taken
in
a
cesspool
is
then
made
to
receive
what
gravel
it
may
bring
down
after
it
has
passed
this
pool
the
water
flowing
through
three
or
four
little
arches
and
then
over
a
paved
bed
and
wall
of
masonry
into
the
canal
these
are
called
and
opposite
them
an
outlet
is
sometimes
made
for
the
waters
of
the
canal
if
they
should
be
above
their
proper
level
or
when
the
may
bring
down
a
rush
these
outlets
consist
of
two
inclined
planes
of
masonry
one
rising
from
the
canal
with
a
pavement
or
waste
weir
between
them
and
when
the
comes
down
like
a
torrent
instead
of
mingling
with
the
canal
it
passes
straight
across
but
these
channels
would
be
insufficient
for
carrying
off
the
whole
surplus
waters
in
time
of
floods
at
one
place
therefore
there
are
three
sluices
by
which
the
whole
canal
from
the
staircase
to
the
regulating
lock
about
six
miles
can
be
lowered
a
foot
in
an
hour
the
sluices
were
opened
that
we
might
see
their
effect
we
went
down
the
bank
and
made
our
way
round
some
wet
ground
till
we
got
in
front
of
the
strong
arch
into
which
they
open
the
arch
is
about
feet
high
of
great
strength
and
built
upon
the
rock
what
would
the
bourbons
have
given
for
such
a
cascade
at
versailles
the
rush
and
the
spray
and
the
force
of
the
water
reminded
me
more
of
the
reichenbach
than
of
any
other
fall
that
three
small
sluices
each
only
feet
by
feet
should
produce
an
effect
which
brought
the
mightiest
of
the
swiss
waterfalls
to
my
recollection
may
appear
incredible
or
at
least
like
an
enormous
exaggeration
but
the
prodigious
velocity
with
which
the
water
is
forced
out
by
the
pressure
above
explains
the
apparent
wonder
and
yet
i
beheld
it
only
in
half
its
strength
the
depth
above
being
at
this
time
ten
feet
which
will
be
twenty
when
the
canal
is
completed
in
a
few
minutes
a
river
was
formed
of
no
inconsiderable
breadth
which
ran
like
a
torrent
into
the
lochy
on
this
part
of
the
canal
everything
is
completed
except
that
the
iron
bridges
for
it
which
are
now
on
their
way
are
supplied
by
temporary
ones
when
the
middle
part
shall
be
finished
the
lochy
which
at
present
flows
in
its
own
channel
above
the
regulating
lock
will
be
dammed
there
and
made
to
join
the
speyne
by
a
new
cut
from
the
lake
the
cut
is
made
and
a
fine
bridge
built
over
it
we
went
into
the
cut
and
under
the
bridge
which
is
very
near
the
intended
point
of
junction
the
were
encrusted
with
stalactites
in
a
manner
singularly
beautiful
under
the
arches
a
strong
mound
of
solid
masonry
is
built
to
keep
the
water
in
dry
seasons
at
a
certain
height
but
in
that
mound
a
gap
is
left
for
the
salmon
and
a
way
made
through
the
rocks
from
the
speyne
to
this
gap
which
they
will
soon
find
out
arrived
at
dumbarton
southey
took
leave
of
john
mitchell
who
had
accompanied
him
throughout
the
tour
and
for
whom
he
seems
to
have
entertained
the
highest
admiration
he
is
indeed
says
southey
a
remarkable
man
and
well
deserving
to
be
remembered
telford
found
him
a
working
mason
who
could
scarcely
read
or
write
but
his
good
sense
his
excellent
conduct
his
steadiness
and
perseverance
have
been
such
that
he
has
been
gradually
raised
to
be
inspector
of
all
these
highland
roads
which
we
have
visited
and
all
of
which
are
under
the
commissioners
care
an
office
requiring
a
rare
union
of
qualities
among
others
inflexible
integrity
a
fearless
temper
and
an
indefatigable
frame
perhaps
no
man
ever
possessed
these
requisites
in
greater
perfection
than
john
mitchell
were
but
his
figure
less
tartarish
and
more
gaunt
he
would
be
the
very
of
spenser
neither
frown
nor
favour
in
the
course
of
fifteen
years
have
ever
made
him
swerve
from
the
fair
performance
of
his
duty
though
the
lairds
with
whom
he
has
to
deal
have
omitted
no
means
of
making
him
enter
into
their
views
and
to
do
things
or
leave
them
undone
as
might
suit
their
humour
or
interest
they
have
attempted
to
cajole
and
to
intimidate
him
alike
in
vain
they
have
repeatedly
preferred
complaints
against
him
in
the
hope
of
getting
him
removed
from
his
office
and
a
more
flexible
person
appointed
in
his
stead
and
they
have
not
unfrequently
threatened
him
with
personal
violence
even
his
life
has
been
menaced
but
mitchell
holds
right
on
in
the
midst
of
his
most
laborious
life
he
has
laboured
to
improve
himself
with
such
success
that
he
has
become
a
good
accountant
makes
his
estimates
with
facility
and
carries
on
his
official

i
have
never

with
and
therefore
it
is
painful
to
think
how
little
likely
it
is
that
i
shall
ever
see
much
of
him
again
how
certain
that
i
shall
never

yet

it
may
be
mentioned
that
miles
of
new
roads
were
planned
by
him
and
executed
under
his
superintendence
at
an
expense
of
of
which
about
was
granted
by
parliament
and
the
remainder
was
raised
by
the
localities
benefited
besides
the
new
roads
miles
of
the
old

were
taken
in

by
him

telford
later
years
his
death
and
character
when
telford
had
occasion
to
visit
london
on
business
during
the
early
period
of
his
career
his
quarters
were
at
the
salopian
coffee
house
now
the
ship
hotel
at
charing
cross
it
is
probable
that
his
shropshire
connections
led
him
in
the
first
instance
to
the
but
the
situation
being
near
to
the
houses
of
parliament
and
in
many
respects
convenient
for
the
purposes
of
his
business
he
continued
to
live
there
for
no
less
a
period
than
years
during
that
time
the
salopian
became
a
favourite
resort
of
engineers
and
not
only
telford
provincial
associates
but
numerous
visitors
from
abroad
where
his
works
attracted
even
more
attention
than
they
did
in
england
took
up
their
quarters
there
several
apartments
were
specially
reserved
for
exclusive
use
and
he
could
always
readily
command
any
additional
accommodation
for
purposes
of
business
or
hospitality
the
successive
landlords
of
the
salopian
came
to
regard
the
engineer
as
a
fixture
and
even
bought
and
sold
him
from
time
to
time
with
the
goodwill
of
the
business
when
he
at
length
resolved
on
the
persuasion
of
his
friends
to
take
a
house
of
his
own
and
gave
notice
of
his
intention
of
leaving
the
landlord
who
had
but
recently
entered
into
possession
almost
stood
aghast
what
leave
the
house
said
he
why
sir
i
have
just
paid
for
you
on
explanation
it
appeared
that
this
price
had
actually
been
paid
by
him
to
the
outgoing
landlord
on
the
assumption
that
telford
was
a
fixture
of
the
hotel
the
previous
tenant
having
paid
for
him
the
increase
in
the
price
marking
very
significantly
the
growing
importance
of
the
engineer
position
there
was
however
no
help
for
the
disconsolate
landlord
and
telford
left
the
salopian
to
take
possession
of
his
new
house
at
abingdon
street
labelye
the
engineer
of
westminster
bridge
had
formerly
occupied
the
dwelling
and
at
a
subsequent
period
sir
william
chambers
the
architect
of
somerset
house
telford
used
to
take
much
pleasure
in
pointing
out
to
his
visitors
the
painting
of
westminster
bridge
impanelled
in
the
wall
over
the
parlour
mantelpiece
made
for
labelye
by
an
italian
artist
whilst
the
bridge
works
were
in
progress
in
that
house
telford
continued
to
live
until
the
close
of
his
life
one
of
the
subjects
in
which
he
took
much
interest
during
his
later
years
was
the
establishment
of
the
institute
of
civil
engineers
in
a
society
had
been
formed
consisting
principally
of
young
men
educated
to
civil
and
mechanical
engineering
who
occasionally
met
to
discuss
matters
of
interest
relating
to
their
profession
as
early
as
the
time
of
smeaton
a
social
meeting
of
engineers
was
occasionally
held
at
an
inn
in
holborn
which
was
discontinued
in
in
consequence
of
some
personal
differences
amongst
the
members
it
was
revived
in
the
following
year
under
the
auspices
of
jessop
naylor
rennie
and
whitworth
and
joined
by
other
gentlemen
of
scientific
distinction
they
were
accustomed
to
dine
together
every
fortnight
at
the
crown
and
anchor
in
the
strand
spending
the
evening
in
conversation
on
engineering
subjects
but
as
the
numbers
and
importance
of
the
profession
increased
the
desire
began
to
be
felt
especially
among
the
junior
members
of
the
profession
for
an
institution
of
a
more
enlarged
character
hence
the
movement
above
alluded
to
which
led
to
an
invitation
being
given
to
telford
to
accept
the
office
of
president
of
the
proposed
engineers
institute
to
this
he
consented
and
entered
upon
the
duties
of
the
office
on
the
of
march
during
the
remainder
of
his
life
telford
continued
to
watch
over
the
progress
of
the
society
which
gradually
grew
in
importance
and
usefulness
he
supplied
it
with
the
nucleus
of
a
reference
library
now
become
of
great
value
to
its
members
he
established
the
practice
of
recording
the
proceedings
minutes
of
discussions
and
substance
of
the
papers
read
which
has
led
to
the
accumulation
in
the
printed
records
of
the
institute
of
a
vast
body
of
information
as
to
engineering
practice
in
he
exerted
himself
strenuously
and
successfully
in
obtaining
a
charter
of
incorporation
for
the
society
and
finally
at
his
death
he
left
the
institute
their
first
bequest
of
together
with
many
valuable
books
and
a
large
collection
of
documents
which
had
been
subservient
to
his
own
professional
labours
in
the
distinguished
position
which
he
occupied
it
was
natural
that
telford
should
be
called
upon
as
he
often
was
towards
the
close
of
his
life
to
give
his
opinion
and
advice
as
to
projects
of
public
importance
where
strongly
conflicting
opinions
were
entertained
on
any
subject
his
help
was
occasionally
found
most
valuable
for
he
possessed
great
tact
and
suavity
of
manner
which
often
enabled
him
to
reconcile
opposing
interests
when
they
stood
in
the
way
of
important
enterprises
in
he
was
appointed
one
of
the
commissioners
to
investigate
the
subject
of
the
supply
of
water
to
the
metropolis
in
conjunction
with
roget
and
professor
brande
and
the
result
was
the
very
able
report
published
in
that
year
only
a
few
months
before
his
death
in
he
prepared
and
sent
in
an
elaborate
separate
report
containing
many
excellent
practical
suggestions
which
had
the
effect
of
stimulating
the
efforts
of
the
water
companies
and
eventually
leading
to
great
improvements
on
the
subject
of
roads
telford
continued
to
be
the
very
highest
authority
his
friend
southey
jocularly
styling
him
the
colossus
of
roads
the
russian
government
frequently
consulted
him
with
reference
to
the
new
roads
with
which
that
great
empire
was
being
opened
up
the
polish
road
from
warsaw
to
briesc
on
the
russian
frontier
miles
in
length
was
constructed
after
his
plans
and
it
remains
we
believe
the
finest
road
in
the
russian
dominions
to
this
day
image
section
of
polish
road
he
was
consulted
by
the
austrian
government
on
the
subject
of
bridges
as
well
as
roads
count
szechenyi
recounts
the
very
agreeable
and
instructive
interview
which
he
had
with
telford
when
he
called
to
consult
him
as
to
the
bridge
proposed
to
be
erected
across
the
danube
between
the
towns
of
buda
and
pesth
on
a
suspension
bridge
being
suggested
by
the
english
engineer
the
count
with
surprise
asked
if
such
an
erection
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
he
had
described
we
do
not
consider
anything
to
be
impossible
replied
telford
impossibilities
exist
chiefly
in
the
prejudices
of
mankind
to
which
some
are
slaves
and
from
which
few
are
able
to
emancipate
themselves
and
enter
on
the
path
of
truth
but
supposing
a
suspension
bridge
were
not
deemed
advisable
under
the
circumstances
and
it
were
considered
necessary
altogether
to
avoid
motion
then
said
he
i
should
recommend
you
to
erect
a
cast
iron
bridge
of
three
spans
each
feet
such
a
bridge
will
have
no
motion
and
though
half
the
world
lay
a
wreck
it
would
still
stand
a
suspension
bridge
was
eventually
resolved
upon
it
was
constructed
by
one
of
ablest
pupils
tierney
clark
between
the
years
and
and
is
justly
regarded
as
one
of
the
greatest
triumphs
of
english
engineering
the
people
proudly
declaring
it
to
be
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
at
a
time
when
speculation
was
very
rife
in
the
year
telford
was
consulted
respecting
a
grand
scheme
for
cutting
a
canal
across
the
isthmus
of
darien
and
about
the
same
time
he
was
employed
to
resurvey
the
line
for
a
ship
canal
which
had
before
occupied
the
attention
of
whitworth
and
rennie
between
bristol
and
the
english
channel
but
although
he
gave
great
attention
to
this
latter
project
and
prepared
numerous
plans
and
reports
upon
it
and
although
an
act
was
actually
passed
enabling
it
to
be
carried
out
the
scheme
was
eventually
abandoned
like
the
preceding
ones
with
the
same
object
for
want
of
the
requisite
funds
our
engineer
had
a
perfect
detestation
of
speculative
jobbing
in
all
its
forms
though
on
one
occasion
he
could
not
help
being
used
as
an
instrument
by
schemers
a
public
company
was
got
up
at
liverpool
in
to
form
a
broad
and
deep
ship
canal
of
about
seven
miles
in
length
from
opposite
liverpool
to
near
helbre
isle
in
the
estuary
of
the
dee
its
object
being
to
enable
the
shipping
of
the
port
to
avoid
the
variable
shoals
and
which
obstruct
the
entrance
to
the
mersey
telford
entered
on
the
project
with
great
zeal
and
his
name
was
widely
quoted
in
its
support
it
appeared
however
that
one
of
its
principal
promoters
who
had
secured
the
right
of
of
the
land
on
which
the
only
possible
entrance
to
the
canal
could
be
formed
on
the
northern
side
suddenly
closed
with
the
corporation
of
liverpool
who
were
opposed
to
the
plan
and
sold
his
partners
as
well
as
the
engineer
for
a
large
sum
of
money
telford
disgusted
at
being
made
the
instrument
of
an
apparent
fraud
upon
the
public
destroyed
all
the
documents
relating
to
the
scheme
and
never
afterwards
spoke
of
it
except
in
terms
of
extreme
indignation
about
the
same
time
the
formation
of
locomotive
railways
was
extensively
discussed
and
schemes
were
set
on
foot
to
construct
them
between
several
of
the
larger
towns
but
telford
was
now
about
seventy
years
old
and
desirous
of
limiting
the
range
of
his
business
rather
than
extending
it
he
declined
to
enter
upon
this
new
branch
of
engineering
yet
in
his
younger
days
he
had
surveyed
numerous
lines
of
railway
amongst
others
one
as
early
as
the
year
from
glasgow
to
berwick
down
the
vale
of
the
tweed
a
line
from
to
carlisle
was
also
surveyed
and
reported
on
by
him
some
years
later
and
the
stratford
and
moreton
railway
was
actually
constructed
under
his
direction
he
made
use
of
railways
in
all
his
large
works
of
masonry
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
the
haulage
of
materials
to
the
points
at
which
they
were
required
to
be
deposited
or
used
there
is
a
paper
of
his
on
the
inland
navigation
of
the
county
of
salop
contained
in
agricultural
survey
of
shropshire
in
which
he
speaks
of
the
judicious
use
of
railways
and
recommends
that
in
all
future
surveys
it
be
an
instruction
to
the
engineers
that
they
do
examine
the
county
with
a
view
of
introducing
iron
railways
wherever
difficulties
may
occur
with
regard
to
the
making
of
navigable
canals
when
the
project
of
the
liverpool
and
manchester
railway
was
started
we
are
informed
that
he
was
offered
the
appointment
of
engineer
but
he
declined
partly
because
of
his
advanced
age
but
also
out
of
a
feeling
of
duty
to
his
employers
the
canal
companies
stating
that
he
could
not
lend
his
name
to
a
scheme
which
if
carried
out
must
so
materially
affect
their
interests
towards
the
close
of
his
life
he
was
afflicted
by
deafness
which
made
him
feel
exceedingly
uncomfortable
in
mixed
society
thanks
to
a
healthy
constitution
unimpaired
by
excess
and
invigorated
by
active
occupation
his
working
powers
had
lasted
longer
than
those
of
most
men
he
was
still
cheerful
and
skilful
in
the
arts
of
his
profession
and
felt
the
same
pleasure
in
useful
work
that
he
had
ever
done
it
was
therefore
with
difficulty
that
he
could
reconcile
himself
to
the
idea
of
retiring
from
the
field
of
honourable
labour
which
he
had
so
long
occupied
into
a
state
of
comparative
inactivity
but
he
was
not
a
man
who
could
be
idle
and
he
determined
like
his
great
predecessor
smeaton
to
occupy
the
remaining
years
of
his
life
in
arranging
his
engineering
papers
for
publication
vigorous
though
he
had
been
he
felt
that
the
time
was
shortly
approaching
when
the
wheels
of
life
must
stand
still
altogether
writing
to
a
friend
at
langholm
he
said
having
now
being
occupied
for
about
years
in
incessant
exertion
i
have
for
some
time
past
arranged
to
decline
the
contest
but
the
numerous
works
in
which
i
am
engaged
have
hitherto
prevented
my
succeeding
in
the
mean
time
i
occasionally
amuse
myself
with
setting
down
in
what
manner
a
long
life
has
been
laboriously
and
i
hope
usefully
employed
and
again
a
little
later
he
writes
during
the
last
twelve
months
i
have
had
several
rubs
at
they
tell
more
seriously
than
formerly
and
call
for
less
exertion
and
require
greater
precautions
i
fancy
that
few
of
my
age
belonging
to
the
valley
of
the
esk
remain
in
the
land
of
the
living
one
of
the
last
works
on
which
telford
was
professionally
consulted
was
at
the
instance
of
the
duke
of
wellington
not
many
years
younger
than
himself
but
of
equally
vigorous
intellectual
powers
as
to
the
improvement
of
dover
harbour
then
falling
rapidly
to
decay
the
gales
of
had
the
effect
of
rolling
an
immense
quantity
of
shingle
up
channel
towards
that
port
at
the
entrance
to
which
it
became
deposited
in
unusual
quantities
so
as
to
render
it
at
times
altogether
inaccessible
the
duke
as
a
military
man
took
a
more
than
ordinary
interest
in
the
improvement
of
dover
as
the
military
and
naval
station
nearest
to
the
french
coast
and
it
fell
to
him
as
lord
warden
of
the
cinque
ports
to
watch
over
the
preservation
of
the
harbour
situated
at
a
point
in
the
english
channel
which
he
regarded
as
of
great
strategic
importance
in
the
event
of
a
continental
war
he
therefore
desired
telford
to
visit
the
place
and
give
his
opinion
as
to
the
most
advisable
mode
of
procedure
with
a
view
to
improving
the
harbour
the
result
was
a
report
in
which
the
engineer
recommended
a
plan
of
sluicing
similar
to
that
adopted
by
smeaton
at
ramsgate
which
was
afterwards
carried
out
with
considerable
success
by
james
walker
this
was
his
last
piece
of
professional
work
a
few
months
later
he
was
laid
up
by
bilious
derangement
of
a
serious
character
which
recurred
with
increased
violence
towards
the
close
of
the
year
and
on
the
of
september
thomas
telford
closed
his
useful
and
honoured
career
at
the
advanced
age
of
with
that
absence
of
ostentation
which
characterised
him
through
life
he
directed
that
his
remains
should
be
laid
without
ceremony
in
the
burial
ground
of
the
parish
church
of
margaret
westminster
but
the
members
of
the
institute
of
civil
engineers
who
justly
deemed
him
their
benefactor
and
chief
ornament
urged
upon
his
executors
the
propriety
of
interring
him
in
westminster
abbey
image
telford
burial
place
in
westminster
abbey
he
was
buried
there
accordingly
near
the
middle
of
the
nave
where
the
letters
thomas
telford
mark
the
place
beneath
which
he
lies
the
adjoining
stone
bears
the
inscription
robert
stephenson
that
engineer
having
during
his
life
expressed
the
wish
that
his
body
should
be
laid
near
that
of
telford
and
the
son
of
the
killingworth
engineman
thus
sleeps
by
the
side
of
the
son
of
the
eskdale
shepherd
it
was
a
long
a
successful
and
a
useful
life
which
thus
ended
every
step
in
his
upward
career
from
the
poor
peasant
hut
in
eskdale
to
westminster
abbey
was
nobly
and
valorously
won
the
man
was
diligent
and
conscientious
whether
as
a
working
mason
hewing
stone
blocks
at
somerset
house
as
a
foreman
of
builders
at
portsmouth
as
a
road
surveyor
at
shrewsbury
or
as
an
engineer
of
bridges
canals
docks
and
harbours
the
success
which
followed
his
efforts
was
thoroughly
he
was
laborious
and
skilful
but
what
was
better
he
was
honest
and
upright
he
was
a
most
reliable
man
and
hence
he
came
to
be
extensively
trusted
whatever
he
undertook
he
endeavoured
to
excel
in
he
would
be
a
hewer
and
he
became
one
he
was
himself
accustomed
to
attribute
much
of
his
success
to
the
thorough
way
in
which
he
had
mastered
the
humble
beginnings
of
this
trade
he
was
even
of
opinion
that
the
course
of
manual
training
he
had
undergone
and
the
drudgery
as
some
would
call
it
of
daily
labour
first
as
an
apprentice
and
afterwards
as
a
journeyman
mason
had
been
of
greater
service
to
him
than
if
he
had
passed
through
the
curriculum
of
a
university
writing
to
his
friend
miss
malcolm
respecting
a
young
man
who
desired
to
enter
the
engineering
profession
he
in
the
first
place
endeavoured
to
dissuade
the
lady
from
encouraging
the
ambition
of
her
protege
the
profession
being
overstocked
and
offering
very
few
prizes
in
proportion
to
the
large
number
of
blanks
but
he
added
if
civil
engineering
notwithstanding
these
discouragements
is
still
preferred
i
may
point
out
that
the
way
in
which
both
rennie
and
myself
proceeded
was
to
serve
a
regular
apprenticeship
to
some
practical
employment
he
to
a
millwright
and
i
to
a
general
in
this
way
we
secured
the
means
by
hard
labour
of
earning
a
subsistence
and
in
time
we
obtained
by
good
conduct
the
confidence
of
our
employers
and
the
public
eventually
rising
into
the
rank
of
what
is
called
civil
engineering
this
is
the
true
way
of
acquiring
practical
skill
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
materials
employed
in
construction
and
last
but
not
least
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
habits
and
dispositions
of
the
workmen
who
carry
out
our
designs
this
course
although
forbidding
to
many
a
young
person
who
believes
it
possible
to
find
a
short
and
rapid
path
to
distinction
is
proved
to
be
otherwise
by
the
two
examples
i
have
cited
for
my
own
part
i
may
truly
aver
that
is
the
ascent
and
slippery
is
the
way
that
telford
was
enabled
to
continue
to
so
advanced
an
age
employed
on
laborious
and
anxious
work
was
no
doubt
attributable
in
a
great
measure
to
the
cheerfulness
of
his
nature
he
was
indeed
a
most
man
it
will
be
remembered
that
when
a
boy
he
had
been
known
in
his
valley
as
laughing
tam
the
same
disposition
continued
to
characterise
him
in
his
old
age
he
was
playful
and
jocular
and
rejoiced
in
the
society
of
children
and
young
people
especially
when
and
modest
but
when
they
pretended
to
acquirements
they
did
not
possess
he
was
quick
to
detect
and
see
through
them
one
day
a
youth
expatiated
to
him
in
very
large
terms
about
a
friend
of
his
who
had
done
this
and
that
and
made
so
and
so
and
could
do
all
manner
of
wonderful
things
telford
listened
with
great
attention
and
when
the
youth
had
done
he
quietly
asked
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
pray
can
your
friend
lay
eggs
when
in
society
he
gave
himself
up
to
it
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
it
he
did
not
sit
apart
a
moody
and
abstracted
lion
nor
desire
to
be
regarded
as
the
great
engineer
pondering
new
menai
bridges
but
he
appeared
in
his
natural
character
of
a
simple
intelligent
cheerful
companion
as
ready
to
laugh
at
his
own
jokes
as
at
other
people
and
he
was
as
communicative
to
a
child
as
to
any
philosopher
of
the
party
robert
southey
than
whom
there
was
no
better
judge
of
a
loveable
man
said
of
him
i
would
go
a
long
way
for
the
sake
of
seeing
telford
and
spending
a
few
days
in
his
company
southey
as
we
have
seen
had
the
best
opportunities
of
knowing
him
well
for
a
long
journey
together
extending
over
many
weeks
is
probably
better
than
anything
else
calculated
to
bring
out
the
weak
as
well
as
the
strong
points
of
a
friend
indeed
many
friendships
have
completely
broken
down
under
the
severe
test
of
a
single
tour
but
southey
on
that
occasion
firmly
cemented
a
friendship
which
lasted
until
telford
death
on
one
occasion
the
latter
called
at
the
poet
house
in
company
with
sir
henry
parnell
when
engaged
upon
the
survey
of
one
of
his
northern
roads
unhappily
southey
was
absent
at
the
time
and
writing
about
the
circumstance
to
a
correspondent
he
said
this
was
a
mortification
to
me
in
as
much
as
i
owe
telford
every
kind
of
friendly
attention
and
like
him
heartily
campbell
the
poet
was
another
early
friend
of
our
engineer
and
the
attachment
seems
to
have
been
mutual
writing
to
currie
of
liverpool
in
campbell
says
i
have
become
acquainted
with
telford
the
engineer
fellow
of
infinite
humour
and
of
strong
enterprising
mind
he
has
almost
made
me
a
already
at
least
he
has
inspired
me
with
new
sensations
of
interest
in
the
improvement
and
ornament
of
our
country
have
you
seen
his
plan
of
london
bridge
or
his
scheme
for
a
new
canal
in
the
north
highlands
which
will
unite
if
put
in
effect
our
eastern
and
atlantic
commerce
and
render
scotland
the
very
emporium
of
navigation
telford
is
a
most
useful
cicerone
in
london
he
is
so
universally
acquainted
and
so
popular
in
his
manners
that
he
can
introduce
one
to
all
kinds
of
novelty
and
all
descriptions
of
interesting
society
shortly
after
campbell
named
his
first
son
after
telford
who
stood
godfather
for
the
boy
indeed
for
many
years
telford
played
the
part
of
mentor
to
the
young
and
impulsive
poet
advising
him
about
his
course
in
life
trying
to
keep
him
steady
and
holding
him
aloof
as
much
as
possible
from
the
seductive
allurements
of
the
capital
but
it
was
a
difficult
task
and
telford
numerous
engagements
necessarily
left
the
poet
at
many
seasons
very
much
to
himself
it
appears
that
they
were
living
together
at
the
salopian
when
campbell
composed
the
first
draft
of
his
poem
of
hohenlinden
and
several
important
emendations
made
in
it
by
telford
were
adopted
by
campbell
although
the
two
friends
pursued
different
roads
in
life
and
for
many
years
saw
little
of
each
other
they
often
met
again
especially
after
telford
took
up
his
abode
at
his
house
in
abingdon
street
where
campbell
was
a
frequent
and
always
a
welcome
guest
when
engaged
upon
his
surveys
our
engineer
was
the
same
simple
cheerful
laborious
man
while
at
work
he
gave
his
whole
mind
to
the
subject
in
hand
thinking
of
nothing
else
for
the
time
dismissing
it
at
the
close
of
each
day
work
but
ready
to
take
it
up
afresh
with
the
next
day
duties
this
was
a
great
advantage
to
him
as
respected
the
prolongation
of
his
working
faculty
he
did
not
take
his
anxieties
to
bed
with
him
as
many
do
and
rise
up
with
them
in
the
morning
but
he
laid
down
the
load
at
the
end
of
each
day
and
resumed
it
all
the
more
cheerfully
when
refreshed
and
invigorated
by
natural
rest
it
was
only
while
the
engrossing
anxieties
connected
with
the
suspension
of
the
chains
of
menai
bridge
were
weighing
heavily
upon
his
mind
that
he
could
not
sleep
and
then
age
having
stolen
upon
him
he
felt
the
strain
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
but
that
great
anxiety
once
fairly
over
his
spirits
speedily
resumed
their
wonted
elasticity
when
engaged
upon
the
construction
of
the
carlisle
and
glasgow
road
he
was
very
fond
of
getting
a
few
of
the
navvy
men
as
he
called
them
to
join
him
at
an
ordinary
at
the
hamilton
arms
hotel
lanarkshire
each
paying
his
own
expenses
on
such
occasions
telford
would
say
that
though
he
could
not
drink
yet
he
would
carve
and
draw
corks
for
them
one
of
the
rules
he
laid
down
was
that
no
business
was
to
be
introduced
from
the
moment
they
sat
down
to
dinner
all
at
once
from
being
the
plodding
engineer
with
responsibility
and
thought
in
every
feature
telford
unbended
and
relaxed
and
became
the
merriest
and
drollest
of
the
party
he
possessed
a
great
fund
of
anecdote
available
for
such
occasions
had
an
extraordinary
memory
for
facts
relating
to
persons
and
families
and
the
wonder
to
many
of
his
auditors
was
how
in
all
the
world
a
man
living
in
london
should
know
so
much
better
about
their
locality
and
many
of
its
oddities
than
they
did
themselves
in
his
leisure
hours
at
home
which
were
but
few
he
occupied
himself
a
good
deal
in
the
perusal
of
miscellaneous
literature
never
losing
his
taste
for
poetry
he
continued
to
indulge
in
the
occasional
composition
of
verses
until
a
comparatively
late
period
of
his
life
one
of
his
most
successful
efforts
being
a
translation
of
the
to
may
from
buchanan
latin
poems
executed
in
a
very
tender
and
graceful
manner
that
he
might
be
enabled
to
peruse
engineering
works
in
french
and
german
he
prosecuted
the
study
of
those
languages
and
with
such
success
that
he
was
shortly
able
to
read
them
with
comparative
ease
he
occasionally
occupied
himself
in
literary
composition
on
subjects
connected
with
his
profession
thus
he
wrote
for
the
edinburgh
encyclopedia
conducted
by
his
friend
sir
david
then
brewster
the
elaborate
and
able
articles
on
architecture
and
besides
his
contributions
to
that
work
he
advanced
a
considerable
sum
of
money
to
aid
in
its
publication
which
remained
a
debt
due
to
his
estate
at
the
period
of
his
death
notwithstanding
the
pains
that
telford
took
in
the
course
of
his
life
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
elements
of
natural
science
it
is
somewhat
remarkable
to
find
him
holding
acquirements
in
mathematics
so
cheap
but
probably
this
is
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
circumstance
of
his
education
being
entirely
practical
and
mainly
when
a
young
man
was
on
one
occasion
recommended
to
him
as
a
pupil
because
of
his
proficiency
in
mathematics
the
engineer
expressed
the
opinion
that
such
acquirements
were
no
recommendation
like
smeaton
he
held
that
deductions
drawn
from
theory
were
never
to
be
trusted
and
he
placed
his
reliance
mainly
on
observation
experience
and
experiments
he
was
also
like
most
men
of
strong
practical
sagacity
quick
in
mother
wit
and
arrived
rapidly
at
conclusions
guided
by
a
sort
of
intellectual
instinct
which
can
neither
be
defined
nor
described
although
occupied
as
a
leading
engineer
for
nearly
forty
years
having
certified
contractors
bills
during
that
time
amounting
to
several
millions
sterling
he
died
in
comparatively
moderate
circumstances
eminent
constructive
ability
was
not
very
highly
remunerated
in
time
and
he
was
satisfied
with
a
rate
of
pay
which
even
the
smallest
would
now
refuse
to
accept
charges
were
however
perhaps
too
low
and
a
deputation
of
members
of
the
profession
on
one
occasion
formally
expostulated
with
him
on
the
subject
although
he
could
not
be
said
to
have
an
indifference
for
money
he
yet
estimated
it
as
a
thing
worth
infinitely
less
than
character
and
every
penny
that
he
earned
was
honestly
come
by
he
had
no
wife
nor
family
nor
near
relations
to
provide
for
only
himself
in
his
old
age
not
being
thought
rich
he
was
saved
the
annoyance
of
being
haunted
by
toadies
or
pestered
by
parasites
his
wants
were
few
and
his
household
expenses
small
and
though
he
entertained
many
visitors
and
friends
it
was
in
a
quiet
way
and
on
a
moderate
scale
the
small
regard
he
had
for
personal
dignity
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
to
the
last
he
continued
the
practice
which
he
had
learnt
when
a
working
mason
of
darning
his
own
stockings
telford
nevertheless
had
the
highest
idea
of
the
dignity
of
his
profession
not
because
of
the
money
it
would
produce
but
of
the
great
things
it
was
calculated
to
accomplish
in
his
most
confidential
letters
we
find
him
often
expatiating
on
the
noble
works
he
was
engaged
in
designing
or
constructing
and
the
national
good
they
were
calculated
to
produce
but
never
on
the
pecuniary
advantages
he
himself
was
to
derive
from
them
he
doubtless
prized
and
prized
highly
the
reputation
they
would
bring
him
and
above
all
there
seemed
to
be
uppermost
in
his
mind
especially
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
career
while
many
of
his
schoolfellows
were
still
alive
the
thought
of
what
will
they
say
of
this
in
eskdale
but
as
for
the
money
results
to
himself
telford
seemed
to
the
close
of
his
life
to
regard
them
as
of
comparatively
small
moment
during
the
years
that
he
acted
as
principal
engineer
for
the
caledonian
canal
we
find
from
the
parliamentary
returns
that
the
amount
paid
to
him
for
his
reports
detailed
plans
and
superintendence
was
exactly
a
year
where
he
conceived
any
works
to
be
of
great
public
importance
and
he
found
them
to
be
promoted
by
persons
at
their
own
expense
he
refused
to
receive
any
payment
for
his
labour
or
even
repayment
of
the
expenses
incurred
by
him
thus
while
employed
by
the
government
in
the
improvement
of
the
highland
roads
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
ought
at
the
same
time
to
promote
the
similar
patriotic
objects
of
the
british
fisheries
society
which
were
carried
out
by
voluntary
subscription
and
for
many
years
he
acted
as
their
engineer
refusing
to
accept
any
remuneration
whatever
for
his
trouble
telford
held
the
sordid
in
perfect
detestation
he
was
of
opinion
that
the
adulation
paid
to
mere
money
was
one
of
the
greatest
dangers
with
which
modern
society
was
threatened
i
admire
commercial
enterprise
he
would
say
it
is
the
vigorous
outgrowth
of
our
industrial
life
i
admire
everything
that
gives
it
free
scope
as
wherever
it
goes
activity
energy
intelligence
all
that
we
call
civilization
accompany
it
but
i
hold
that
the
aim
and
end
of
all
ought
not
to
be
a
mere
bag
of
money
but
something
far
higher
and
far
better
writing
once
to
his
langholm
correspondent
about
an
old
schoolfellow
who
had
grown
rich
by
scraping
telford
said
poor
bob
l
his
industry
and
sagacity
were
more
than
counterbalanced
by
his
childish
vanity
and
silly
avarice
which
rendered
his
friendship
dangerous
and
his
conversation
tiresome
he
was
like
a
man
in
london
whose
lips
while
walking
by
himself
along
the
streets
were
constantly
ejaculating
money
but
peace
to
memory
i
need
scarcely
add
confusion
to
his
thousands
telford
was
himself
most
careful
in
resisting
the
temptations
to
which
men
in
his
position
are
frequently
exposed
but
he
was
preserved
by
his
honest
pride
not
less
than
by
the
purity
of
his
character
he
invariably
refused
to
receive
anything
in
the
shape
of
presents
or
testimonials
from
persons
employed
under
him
he
would
not
have
even
the
shadow
of
an
obligation
stand
in
the
way
of
his
duty
to
those
who
employed
him
to
watch
over
and
protect
their
interests
during
the
many
years
that
he
was
employed
on
public
works
no
one
could
ever
charge
him
in
the
remotest
degree
with
entering
into
a
collusion
with
contractors
he
looked
upon
such
arrangements
as
degrading
and
infamous
and
considered
that
they
meant
nothing
less
than
an
inducement
to
scamping
which
he
would
never
tolerate
his
inspection
of
work
was
most
rigid
the
security
of
his
structures
was
not
a
question
of
money
but
of
character
as
human
life
depended
upon
their
stability
not
a
point
was
neglected
that
could
ensure
it
hence
in
his
selection
of
resident
engineers
and
inspectors
of
works
he
exercised
the
greatest
possible
precautions
and
here
his
observation
of
character
proved
of
essential
value
hughes
says
he
never
allowed
any
but
his
most
experienced
and
confidential
assistants
to
have
anything
to
do
with
exploring
the
foundations
of
buildings
he
was
about
to
erect
his
scrutiny
into
the
qualifications
of
those
employed
about
such
structures
extended
to
the
subordinate
overseers
and
even
to
the
workmen
insomuch
that
men
whose
general
habits
had
before
passed
unnoticed
and
whose
characters
had
never
been
inquired
into
did
not
escape
his
observation
when
set
to
work
in
operations
connected
with
foundations
if
he
detected
a
man
who
gave
evidences
of
unsteadiness
inaccuracy
or
carelessness
he
would
reprimand
the
overseer
for
employing
such
a
person
and
order
him
to
be
removed
to
some
other
part
of
the
undertaking
where
his
negligence
could
do
no
harm
and
thus
it
was
that
telford
put
his
own
character
through
those
whom
he
employed
into
the
various
buildings
which
he
was
employed
to
construct
but
though
telford
was
comparatively
indifferent
about
money
he
was
not
without
a
proper
regard
for
it
as
a
means
of
conferring
benefits
on
others
and
especially
as
a
means
of
being
independent
at
the
close
of
his
life
he
had
accumulated
as
much
as
invested
at
interest
brought
him
in
about
a
year
and
enabled
him
to
occupy
the
house
in
abingdon
street
in
which
he
died
this
was
amply
sufficient
for
his
wants
and
more
than
enough
for
his
independence
it
enabled
him
also
to
continue
those
secret
acts
of
benevolence
which
constituted
perhaps
the
most
genuine
pleasure
of
his
life
it
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
traits
in
this
excellent
man
career
to
find
him
so
constantly
occupied
in
works
of
spontaneous
charity
in
quarters
so
remote
and
unknown
that
it
is
impossible
the
slightest
feeling
of
ostentation
could
have
sullied
the
purity
of
the
acts
among
the
large
mass
of
telford
private
letters
which
have
been
submitted
to
us
we
find
frequent
reference
to
sums
of
money
transmitted
for
the
support
of
poor
people
in
his
native
valley
at
new
year
time
he
regularly
sent
remittances
of
from
to
to
be
distributed
by
the
kind
miss
malcolm
of
burnfoot
and
after
her
death
by
little
the
postmaster
at
langholm
and
the
contributions
thus
so
kindly
made
did
much
to
fend
off
the
winter
cold
and
surround
with
many
small
comforts
those
who
most
needed
help
but
were
perhaps
too
modest
to
ask
it
many
of
those
in
the
valley
of
the
esk
had
known
of
telford
in
his
younger
years
as
a
poor
barefooted
boy
though
now
become
a
man
of
distinction
he
had
too
much
good
sense
to
be
ashamed
of
his
humble
origin
perhaps
he
even
felt
proud
that
by
dint
of
his
own
valorous
and
persevering
efforts
he
had
been
able
to
rise
so
much
above
it
throughout
his
long
life
his
heart
always
warmed
at
the
thought
of
eskdale
he
rejoiced
at
the
honourable
rise
of
eskdale
men
as
reflecting
credit
upon
his
beloved
valley
thus
writing
to
his
langholm
correspondent
with
reference
to
the
honours
conferred
on
the
different
members
of
the
family
of
malcolm
he
said
the
distinctions
so
deservedly
bestowed
upon
the
burnfoot
family
establish
a
splendid
era
in
eskdale
and
almost
tempt
your
correspondent
to
sport
his
swedish
honours
which
that
grateful
country
has
repeatedly
in
spite
of
refusal
transmitted
it
might
be
said
that
there
was
narrowness
and
provincialism
in
this
but
when
young
men
are
thrown
into
the
world
with
all
its
temptations
and
snares
it
is
well
that
the
recollections
of
home
and
kindred
should
survive
to
hold
them
in
the
path
of
rectitude
and
cheer
them
in
their
onward
and
upward
course
in
life
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
telford
was
borne
up
on
many
occasions
by
the
thought
of
what
the
folks
in
the
valley
would
say
about
him
and
his
progress
in
life
when
they
met
together
at
market
or
at
the
westerkirk
porch
on
sabbath
mornings
in
this
light
provincialism
or
local
patriotism
is
a
prolific
source
of
good
and
may
be
regarded
as
among
the
most
valuable
and
beautiful
emanations
of
the
parish
life
of
our
country
although
telford
was
honoured
with
the
titles
and
orders
of
merit
conferred
upon
him
by
foreign
monarchs
what
he
esteemed
beyond
them
all
was
the
respect
and
gratitude
of
his
own
countrymen
and
not
least
the
honour
which
his
really
noble
and
beneficent
career
was
calculated
to
reflect
upon
the
folks
of
the
nook
the
remote
inhabitants
of
his
native
eskdale
when
the
engineer
proceeded
to
dispose
of
his
savings
by
will
which
he
did
a
few
months
before
his
death
the
distribution
was
a
comparatively
easy
matter
the
total
amount
of
his
bequeathments
was
about
of
the
whole
he
set
apart
for
educational
purposes
to
the
civil
engineers
institute
and
each
to
the
ministers
of
langholm
and
westerkirk
in
trust
for
the
parish
libraries
the
rest
was
bequeathed
in
sums
of
from
to
to
different
persons
who
had
acted
as
clerks
assistants
and
surveyors
in
his
various
public
works
and
to
his
intimate
personal
friends
amongst
these
latter
were
colonel
pasley
the
nephew
of
his
early
benefactor
rickman
milne
and
hope
his
three
executors
and
robert
southey
and
thomas
campbell
the
poets
to
both
of
these
last
the
gift
was
most
welcome
southey
said
of
his
telford
has
most
kindly
and
unexpectedly
left
me
with
a
share
of
his
residuary
property
which
i
am
told
will
make
it
amount
in
all
to
this
is
truly
a
godsend
and
i
am
most
grateful
for
it
it
gives
me
the
comfortable
knowledge
that
if
it
should
please
god
soon
to
take
me
from
this
world
my
family
would
have
resources
fully
sufficient
for
their
support
till
such
time
as
their
affairs
could
be
put
in
order
and
the
proceeds
of
my
books
remains
be
rendered
available
i
have
never
been
anxious
overmuch
nor
ever
taken
more
thought
for
the
morrow
than
it
is
the
duty
of
every
one
to
take
who
has
to
earn
his
livelihood
but
to
be
thus
provided
for
at
this
time
i
feel
to
be
an
especial
blessing
among
the
most
valuable
results
of
telford
bequests
in
his
own
district
was
the
establishment
of
the
popular
libraries
at
langholm
and
westerkirk
each
of
which
now
contains
about
volumes
that
at
westerkirk
had
been
originally
instituted
in
the
year
by
the
miners
employed
to
work
an
antimony
mine
since
abandoned
on
the
farm
of
glendinning
within
sight
of
the
place
where
telford
was
born
on
the
dissolution
of
the
mining
company
in
the
little
collection
of
books
was
removed
to
kirkton
hill
but
on
receipt
of
bequest
a
special
building
was
erected
for
their
reception
at
old
bentpath
near
the
village
of
westerkirk
the
annual
income
derived
from
the
telford
fund
enabled
additions
of
new
volumes
to
be
made
to
it
from
time
to
time
and
its
uses
as
a
public
institution
were
thus
greatly
increased
the
books
are
exchanged
once
a
month
on
the
day
of
the
full
moon
on
which
occasion
readers
of
all
ages
and
conditions
farmers
shepherds
ploughmen
labourers
and
their
children
resort
to
it
from
far
and
near
taking
away
with
them
as
many
volumes
as
they
desire
for
the
month
readings
thus
there
is
scarcely
a
cottage
in
the
valley
in
which
good
books
are
not
to
be
found
under
perusal
and
we
are
told
that
it
is
a
common
thing
for
the
eskdale
shepherd
to
take
a
book
in
his
plaid
to
the
a
volume
of
shakespeare
prescott
or
macaulay
and
read
it
there
under
the
blue
sky
with
his
sheep
and
the
green
hills
before
him
and
thus
so
long
as
the
bequest
lasts
the
good
great
engineer
will
not
cease
to
be
remembered
with
gratitude
in
his
beloved
eskdale
footnotes
for
chapter
xv
in
his
inaugural
address
to
the
members
on
taking
the
chair
the
president
pointed
out
that
the
principles
of
the
institution
rested
on
the
practical
efforts
and
unceasing
perseverance
of
the
members
themselves
in
foreign
countries
he
said
similar
establishments
are
instituted
by
government
and
their
members
and
proceedings
are
under
their
control
but
here
a
different
course
being
adopted
it
becomes
incumbent
on
each
individual
member
to
feel
that
the
very
existence
and
prosperity
of
the
institution
depend
in
no
small
degree
on
his
personal
conduct
and
exertions
and
my
merely
mentioning
the
circumstance
will
i
am
convinced
be
sufficient
to
command
the
best
efforts
of
the
present
and
future
members
we
are
informed
by
joseph
mitchell
of
the
origin
of
this
practice
mitchell
was
a
pupil
of
telford
living
with
him
in
his
house
at
abingdon
street
it
was
the
custom
to
have
a
dinner
party
every
tuesday
after
which
his
engineering
friends
were
invited
to
accompany
him
to
the
institution
the
meetings
of
which
were
then
held
on
tuesday
evenings
in
a
house
in
buckingham
street
strand
the
meetings
did
not
usually
consist
of
more
than
from
twenty
to
thirty
persons
mitchell
took
notes
of
the
conversations
which
followed
the
reading
of
the
papers
telford
afterwards
found
his
pupil
extending
the
notes
on
which
he
asked
permission
to
read
them
and
was
so
much
pleased
that
he
took
them
to
the
next
meeting
and
read
them
to
the
members
mitchell
was
then
formally
appointed
reporter
of
conversations
to
the
institute
and
the
custom
having
been
continued
a
large
mass
of
valuable
practical
information
has
thus
been
placed
on
record
supplement
to
weale
count
szechenyi
report
letter
to
little
langholm
august
a
statue
of
him
by
bailey
has
since
been
placed
in
the
east
aisle
of
the
north
transept
known
as
the
islip
chapel
it
is
considered
a
fine
work
but
its
effect
is
quite
lost
in
consequence
of
the
crowded
state
of
the
aisle
which
has
very
much
the
look
of
a
sculptor
workshop
the
subscription
raised
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
the
statue
was
of
which
was
paid
to
the
dean
for
permission
to
place
it
within
the
abbey
letter
to
miss
malcolm
burnfoot
langholm
dated
october
sir
david
brewster
observes
on
this
point
it
is
difficult
to
analyse
that
peculiar
faculty
of
mind
which
directs
a
successful
engineer
who
is
not
guided
by
the
deductions
of
the
exact
sciences
but
it
must
consist
mainly
in
the
power
of
observing
the
effects
of
natural
causes
acting
in
a
variety
of
circumstances
and
in
the
judicious
application
of
this
knowledge
to
cases
when
the
same
causes
come
into
operation
but
while
this
sagacity
is
a
prominent
feature
in
the
designs
of
telford
it
appears
no
less
distinctly
in
the
choice
of
the
men
by
whom
they
were
to
be
practically
executed
his
quick
perception
of
character
his
honesty
of
purpose
and
his
contempt
for
all
otheracquirements
save
that
practical
knowledge
and
experience
which
was
best
fitted
to
accomplish
in
the
best
manner
the
object
he
had
in
view
have
enables
him
to
leave
behind
him
works
of
inestimable
value
and
monuments
of
professional
celebrity
which
have
not
been
surpassed
either
in
britain
or
in
europe
review
vol
lxx
it
seems
singular
that
with
telford
great
natural
powers
of
pleasing
his
warm
social
temperament
and
his
capability
of
forming
ardent
attachments
for
friends
many
of
them
women
he
should
never
have
formed
an
attachment
of
the
heart
even
in
his
youthful
and
poetical
days
the
subject
of
love
so
frequently
the
theme
of
boyish
song
is
never
alluded
to
while
his
school
friendships
are
often
recalled
to
mind
and
indeed
made
the
special
subject
of
his
verse
it
seems
odd
to
find
him
when
at
shrewsbury
a
handsome
fellow
with
a
good
position
and
many
beautiful
women
about
him
addressing
his
friend
the
blind
schoolmaster
at
langholm
as
his
stella
mitchell
says
he
lived
at
the
rate
of
about
a
year
he
kept
a
carriage
but
no
horses
and
used
his
carriage
principally
for
making
his
journeys
through
the
country
on
business
i
once
accompanied
him
to
bath
and
cornwall
when
he
made
me
keep
an
accurate
journal
of
all
i
saw
he
used
to
lecture
us
on
being
independent
even
in
little
matters
and
not
ask
servants
to
do
for
us
what
we
might
easily
do
for
ourselves
he
carried
in
his
pocket
a
small
book
containing
needles
thread
and
buttons
and
on
an
emergency
was
always
ready
to
put
in
a
stitch
a
curious
habit
he
had
of
mending
his
stockings
which
i
suppose
he
acquired
when
a
working
mason
he
would
not
permit
his
housekeeper
to
touch
them
but
after
his
work
at
night
about
nine
or
half
past
he
would
go
up
stairs
and
take
down
a
lot
and
sit
mending
them
with
great
apparent
delight
in
his
own
room
till
i
have
frequently
gone
in
to
him
with
some
message
and
found
him
occupied
with
this
work
the
british
fisheries
society
adds
rickman
did
not
suffer
themselves
to
be
entirely
outdone
in
liberality
and
shortly
before
his
death
they
pressed
upon
telford
a
very
handsome
gift
of
plate
which
being
inscribed
with
expressions
of
their
thankfulness
and
gratitude
towards
him
he
could
not
possibly
refuse
to
accept

thought
so
little
about

that
he
did

know

he

turned
out
that
instead
of
it
was
about
so
that
his

had
their

nearly
doubled

many
years
he
had
abstained
from
drawing
the
dividends
on
the
shares
which
he
held
in
the
canals
and
other
public
companies
in
which
he
was
concerned

was
found
that
