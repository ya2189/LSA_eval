henry
clay
delivered
a
speech
in
the
united
states
senate
which
was
intended
to
smooth
away
the
difficulties
which
his
moderate
opposition
to
the
encroachments
of
slavery
had
erected
in
his
path
to
the
presidency
his
calumniation
of
called
out
the
following
summary
of
the
career
of
the
great
irish
patriot
it
was
published
originally
in
the
pennsylvania
freeman
of
philadelphia
april
perhaps
the
most
unlucky
portion
of
the
unlucky
speech
of
henry
clay
on
the
slavery
question
is
that
in
which
an
attempt
is
made
to
hold
up
to
scorn
and
contempt
the
great
liberator
of
ireland
we
say
an
attempt
for
who
will
say
it
has
succeeded
who
feels
contempt
for
surely
not
the
slaveholder
from
henry
clay
surrounded
by
his
gang
at
ashland
to
the
most
miserable
and
squalid
and
small
breeder
of
human
cattle
in
virginia
and
maryland
who
can
spell
the
name
of
in
his
newspaper
these
republican
brokers
in
blood
fear
and
hate
the
eloquent
irishman
but
their
contempt
forsooth
talk
of
the
contempt
for
the
officer
of
justice
who
nails
his
ears
to
the
pillory
or
sets
the
branding
iron
on
his
forehead
after
denouncing
the
abolitionists
for
gratuitously
republishing
the
advertisements
for
runaway
slaves
the
kentucky
orator
says
and
like
a
notorious
agitator
upon
another
theatre
they
would
hunt
down
and
proscribe
from
the
pale
of
civilized
society
the
inhabitants
of
that
entire
section
allow
me
president
to
say
that
whilst
i
recognize
in
the
justly
wounded
feelings
of
the
minister
of
the
united
states
at
the
court
of
james
much
to
excuse
the
notice
which
he
was
provoked
to
take
of
that
agitator
in
my
humble
opinion
he
would
better
have
consulted
the
dignity
of
his
station
and
of
his
country
in
treating
him
with
contemptuous
silence
he
would
exclude
us
from
european
society
he
who
himself
can
only
obtain
a
contraband
admission
and
is
received
with
scornful
repugnance
into
it
if
he
be
no
more
desirous
of
our
society
than
we
are
of
his
he
may
rest
assured
that
a
state
of
perpetual
intercourse
will
exist
between
us
yes
sir
i
think
the
american
minister
would
best
have
pursued
the
dictates
of
true
dignity
by
regarding
the
language
of
the
member
of
the
british
house
of
commons
as
the
malignant
ravings
of
the
plunderer
of
his
own
country
and
the
libeller
of
a
foreign
and
kindred
people
the
recoil
of
this
attack
followed
hard
upon
the
tones
of
congratulation
and
triumph
of
partisan
editors
at
the
consummate
skill
and
dexterity
with
which
their
candidate
for
the
presidency
had
absolved
himself
from
the
suspicion
of
abolitionism
and
by
a
of
policy
secured
the
confidence
of
the
slaveholding
section
of
the
union
but
the
late
whig
defeat
in
new
york
has
put
an
end
to
these
premature
rejoicings
the
speech
of
clay
in
reference
to
the
irish
agitator
has
been
made
use
of
against
us
with
no
small
success
say
the
new
york
papers
they
failed
says
the
daily
evening
star
to
convince
the
irish
voters
that
daniel
was
the
of
his
country
or
that
there
was
an
excuse
for
thus
denouncing
him
the
defeat
of
the
whigs
of
new
york
and
the
cause
of
it
have
excited
no
small
degree
of
alarm
among
the
adherents
of
the
kentucky
orator
in
this
city
the
delicate
comes
magnanimously
to
the
aid
of
henry
clay
a
twittering
on
an
eagle
back
the
learned
editor
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
daniel
is
a
political
beggar
a
disorganizing
apostate
talks
in
its
pretty
way
of
the
man
impudence
and
falsehoods
and
cowardice
etc
and
finally
with
a
modesty
and
gravity
which
we
can
not
but
admire
assures
us
that
his
weakness
of
mind
is
almost
beyond
calculation
we
have
heard
it
rumored
during
the
past
week
among
some
of
the
constituted
organs
of
the
clay
party
in
this
city
that
at
a
late
meeting
in
chestnut
street
a
committee
was
appointed
to
collect
collate
and
publish
the
correspondence
between
andrew
stevenson
and
and
so
much
of
the
latter
speeches
and
writings
as
relate
to
american
slavery
for
the
purpose
of
convincing
the
countrymen
of
of
the
justice
propriety
and
in
view
of
the
aggravated
circumstances
of
the
case
moderation
and
forbearance
of
henry
clay
when
speaking
of
a
man
who
has
had
the
impudence
to
intermeddle
with
the
patriarchal
institutions
of
our
country
and
with
the
domestic
relations
of
kentucky
and
virginia
we
wait
impatiently
for
the
fruits
of
the
labors
of
this
sagacious
committee
we
should
like
to
see
those
eloquent
and
thrilling
appeals
to
the
sense
of
shame
and
justice
and
honor
of
america
republished
we
should
like
to
see
if
any
irishman
not
wholly
recreant
to
the
interests
and
welfare
of
the
green
island
of
his
birth
will
in
consequence
of
this
publication
give
his
vote
to
the
slanderer
of
ireland
best
and
noblest
champion
but
who
is
daniel
a
demagogue
a
ruffian
agitator
say
the
tory
journals
of
great
britain
quaking
meantime
with
awe
and
apprehension
before
the
tremendous
moral
and
political
power
which
he
is
wielding
a
power
at
this
instant
mightier
than
that
of
any
potentate
of
europe
a
blackguard
a
fellow
who
obtains
contraband
admission
into
european
society
a
malignant
libeller
a
plunderer
of
his
country
a
man
whose
wind
should
be
stopped
say
the
american
slaveholders
and
their
apologists
clay
stevenson
hamilton
and
the
philadelphia
gazette
and
the
democratic
whig
association
but
who
is
daniel
ireland
now
does
justice
to
him
the
world
will
do
so
hereafter
no
individual
of
the
present
age
has
done
more
for
human
liberty
his
labors
to
effect
the
peaceable
deliverance
of
his
own
oppressed
countrymen
and
to
open
to
the
nations
of
europe
a
new
and
purer
and
holier
pathway
to
freedom
unstained
with
blood
and
unmoistened
by
tears
and
his
mighty
instrumentality
in
the
abolition
of
british
colonial
slavery
have
left
their
impress
upon
the
age
they
will
be
remembered
and
felt
beneficially
long
after
the
miserable
slanders
of
tory
envy
and
malignity
at
home
and
the
clamors
of
slaveholders
abroad
detected
in
their
guilt
and
writhing
in
the
gaze
of
christendom
shall
have
perished
forever
when
the
clays
and
calhouns
the
peels
and
wellingtons
the
opponents
of
reform
in
great
britain
and
the
enemies
of
slave
emancipation
in
the
united
states
shall
be
numbered
with
those
who
in
all
ages
to
use
the
words
of
the
eloquent
lamartine
have
sinned
against
the
holy
ghost
in
opposing
the
improvement
of
things
in
an
egotistical
and
stupid
attempt
to
draw
back
the
moral
and
social
world
which
god
and
nature
are
urging
forward
the
character
and
services
of
have
never
been
fully
appreciated
in
this
country
engrossed
in
our
own
peculiar
interests
and
in
the
plenitude
of
our
believing
that
we
are
the
people
and
that
wisdom
will
perish
with
us
that
all
patriotism
and
liberality
of
feeling
are
confined
to
our
own
territory
we
have
not
followed
the
untitled
barrister
of
derrynane
abbey
step
by
step
through
the
development
of
one
of
the
noblest
experiments
ever
made
for
the
cause
of
liberty
and
the
welfare
of
man
the
revolution
which
has
already
partially
effected
in
his
native
land
and
which
from
the
evident
signs
of
cooperation
in
england
and
scotland
seems
not
far
from
its
entire
accomplishment
will
form
a
new
era
in
the
history
of
the
civilized
world
heretofore
the
patriot
has
relied
more
upon
physical
than
moral
means
for
the
regeneration
of
his
country
and
its
redemption
from
oppression
his
revolutions
however
pure
in
principle
have
ended
in
practical
crime
the
great
truth
was
yet
to
be
learned
that
brute
force
is
incompatible
with
a
pure
love
of
freedom
inasmuch
as
it
is
in
itself
an
odious
species
of
tyranny
the
relic
of
an
age
of
slavery
and
barbarism
the
common
argument
of
despotism
a
game
which
were
their
subjects
wise
kings
would
not
play
at
but
the
revolution
in
which
is
engaged
although
directed
against
the
oppression
of
centuries
relies
with
just
confidence
upon
the
united
moral
energies
of
the
people
a
moral
victory
of
reason
over
prejudice
of
justice
over
oppression
the
triumph
of
intellectual
energy
where
the
brute
appeal
to
arms
had
miserably
failed
the
vindication
of
man
eternal
rights
not
by
the
sword
fleshed
in
human
hearts
but
by
weapons
tempered
in
the
armory
of
heaven
with
truth
and
mercy
and
love
nor
is
it
a
visionary
idea
or
the
untried
theory
of
an
enthusiast
this
triumphant
reliance
upon
moral
and
intellectual
power
for
the
reform
of
political
abuses
for
the
overthrowing
of
tyranny
and
the
pulling
down
of
the
strongholds
of
arbitrary
power
the
emancipation
of
the
catholic
of
great
britain
from
the
thrall
of
a
century
in
prepared
the
way
for
the
bloodless
triumph
of
english
reform
in
the
catholic
association
was
the
germ
of
those
political
unions
which
compelled
by
their
mighty
yet
peaceful
influence
the
king
of
england
to
yield
submissively
to
the
supremacy
of
the
people
the
celebrated
attwood
has
been
called
the
father
of
political
unions
in
a
speech
delivered
by
his
brother
attwood
at
the
sunderland
reform
meeting
september
i
find
the
following
admission
gentlemen
the
first
political
union
was
the
roman
catholic
association
of
ireland
and
the
true
founder
and
father
of
political
unions
is
daniel
both
of
these
remarkable
events
these
revolutions
shaking
nations
to
their
centre
yet
polluted
with
no
blood
and
sullied
by
no
crime
were
effected
by
the
salutary
agitations
of
the
public
mind
first
set
in
motion
by
the
masterspirit
of
and
spreading
from
around
him
to
every
portion
of
the
british
empire
like
the
undulations
from
the
disturbed
centre
of
a
lake
the
catholic
question
has
been
but
imperfectly
understood
in
this
country
many
have
allowed
their
just
disapprobation
of
the
catholic
religion
to
degenerate
into
a
most
unwarrantable
prejudice
against
its
conscientious
followers
the
cruel
persecutions
of
the
dissenters
from
the
romish
church
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
day
the
horrors
of
the
inquisition
the
crusades
against
the
albigenses
and
the
simple
dwellers
of
the
vaudois
valleys
have
been
regarded
as
atrocities
peculiar
to
the
believers
in
papal
infallibility
and
the
necessary
consequences
of
their
doctrines
and
hence
they
have
looked
upon
the
constitutional
agitation
of
the
irish
catholics
for
relief
from
grieveous
disabilities
and
unjust
distinctions
as
a
struggle
merely
for
supremacy
or
power
strange
that
the
truth
to
which
all
history
so
strongly
testifies
should
thus
be
overlooked
the
undeniable
truth
that
religious
bigotry
and
intolerance
have
been
confined
to
no
single
sect
that
the
persecuted
of
one
century
have
been
the
persecutors
of
another
in
our
own
country
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
remember
that
at
the
very
time
when
in
new
england
the
catholic
the
quaker
and
the
baptist
were
banished
on
pain
of
death
and
where
some
even
suffered
that
dreadful
penalty
in
catholic
maryland
under
the
catholic
lord
baltimore
perfect
liberty
of
conscience
was
established
and
papist
and
protestant
went
quietly
through
the
same
streets
to
their
respective
altars
at
the
commencement
of
labors
for
emancipation
he
found
the
people
of
ireland
divided
into
three
great
classes
the
protestant
or
church
party
the
dissenters
and
the
catholics
the
church
party
constituting
about
one
tenth
of
the
population
yet
holding
in
possession
the
government
and
a
great
proportion
of
the
landed
property
of
ireland
controlling
church
and
state
and
law
and
revenue
the
army
navy
magistracy
and
corporations
the
entire
patronage
of
the
country
holding
their
property
and
power
by
the
favor
of
england
and
consequently
wholly
devoted
to
her
interest
the
dissenters
probably
twice
as
numerous
as
the
church
party
mostly
engaged
in
trade
and
manufactures
sustained
by
their
own
talents
and
industry
irish
in
feeling
partaking
in
no
small
degree
of
the
oppression
of
their
catholic
brethren
and
among
the
first
to
resist
that
oppression
in
the
catholics
constituting
at
least
two
thirds
of
the
whole
population
and
almost
the
entire
peasantry
of
the
country
forming
a
large
proportion
of
the
mercantile
interest
yet
nearly
excluded
from
the
possession
of
landed
property
by
the
tyrannous
operation
of
the
penal
laws
justly
has
a
celebrated
irish
patriot
theobald
wolfe
tone
spoken
of
these
laws
as
an
execrable
and
infamous
code
framed
with
the
art
and
malice
of
demons
to
plunder
and
degrade
and
brutalize
the
catholics
of
ireland
there
was
no
disgrace
no
injustice
no
disqualification
moral
political
or
religious
civil
or
military
which
it
has
not
heaped
upon
them
the
following
facts
relative
to
the
disabilities
under
which
the
catholics
of
the
united
kingdom
labored
previous
to
the
emancipation
of
will
serve
to
show
in
some
measure
the
oppressive
operation
of
those
laws
which
placed
the
foot
of
one
tenth
of
the
population
of
ireland
upon
the
necks
of
the
remainder

could
not
sit

and
in

he
was
excluded
from
the
grand
juries
commenced
his
labors
for
emancipation
with
the
strong
conviction
that
nothing
short
of
the
united
exertions
of
the
irish
people
could
overthrow
the
power
of
the
existing
government
and
that
a
union
of
action
could
only
be
obtained
by
the
establishment
of
something
like

between

parties
discarding
all
other
than
peaceful
means
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
he
placed
himself
and
his
followers
beyond
the
cognizance
of
unjust
and
oppressive
laws
wherever
he
poured
the
oil
of
his
eloquence
upon
the
maddened
spirits
of
his
wronged
and
insulted
countrymen
the
mercenary
soldiery
found
no
longer
an
excuse
for
violence
and
calm
firm
and
united
the
catholic
association
remained
secure
in
the
moral
strength
of
its
pure
and
peaceful
purpose
amid
the
bayonets
of
a
tory
administration
his
influence
was
felt
in
all
parts
of
the
island
wherever
an
unlawful
association
existed
his
great
legal
knowledge
enabled
him
at
once
to
detect
its
character
and
by
urging
its
dissolution
to
snatch
its
deluded
members
from
the
ready
fangs
of
their
enemies
in
his
presence
the
catholic
and
the
protestant
shook
hands
together
and
the
wild
irish
clansman
forgot
his
feuds
he
taught
the
party
in
power
and
who
trembled
at
the
dangers
around
them
that
security
and
peace
could
only
be
obtained
by
justice
and
kindness
he
entreated
his
oppressed
catholic
brethren
to
lay
aside
their
weapons
and
with
pure
hearts
and
naked
hands
to
stand
firmly
together
in
the
calm
but
determined
energy
of
men
too
humane
for
deeds
of
violence
yet
too
mighty
for
the
patient
endurance
of
wrong
the
spirit
of
the
olden
time
was
awakened
of
the
day
when
flood
thundered
and
curran
lightened
the
light
which
shone
for
a
moment
in
the
darkness
of
ireland
century
of
wrong
burned
upwards
clearly
and
steadily
from
all
its
ancient
altars
shoulder
to
shoulder
gathered
around
him
the
patriot
spirits
of
his
nation
men
unbribed
by
the
golden
spoils
of
governmental
patronage
shiel
with
his
ardent
eloquence
and
walsh
and
grattan
and
and
steel
the
protestant
agitator
wearing
around
him
the
emblem
of
national
reconciliation
of
the
reunion
of
catholic
and
protestant
the
sash
of
blended
orange
and
green
soiled
and
defaced
by
his
patriotic
errands
stained
with
the
smoke
of
cabins
and
the
night
rains
and
rust
of
weapons
and
the
mountain
mist
and
the
droppings
of
the
wild
woods
of
clare
he
united
in
one
mighty
and
resistless
mass
the
broken
and
discordant
factions
whose
desultory
struggles
against
tyranny
had
hitherto
only
added
strength
to
its
fetters
and
infused
into
that
mass
his
own
lofty
principles
of
action
until
the
solemn
tones
of
expostulation
and
entreaty
bursting
at
once
from
the
full
heart
of
ireland
were
caught
up
by
england
and
echoed
back
from
scotland
and
the
language
of
justice
and
humanity
was
wrung
from
the
reluctant
lips
of
the
cold
and
remorseless
oppressor
of
his
native
land
at
once
its
disgrace
and
glory
the
conqueror
of
napoleon
and
in
the
words
of
his
own
curran
the
chains
of
the
catholic
fell
from
around
him
and
he
stood
forth
redeemed
and
disenthralled
by
the
irresistible
genius
of
universal
emancipation
on
the
passage
of
the
bill
for
catholic
emancipation
took
his
seat
in
the
british
parliament
the
eyes
of
millions
were
upon
him
ireland
betrayed
so
often
by
those
in
whom
she
had
placed
her
confidence
brooding
in
sorrowful
remembrance
over
the
noble
names
and
brilliant
reputations
sullied
by
treachery
and
corruption
the
long
and
dark
catalogue
of
her
recreant
sons
who
allured
by
british
gold
and
british
patronage
had
sacrificed
on
the
altar
of
their
ambition
irish
pride
and
irish
independence
and
lifted
their
parricidal
arms
against
their
sorrowing
mother
crownless
and
voiceless
in
her
woe
now
hung
with
breathless
eagerness
over
the
ordeal
to
which
her
last
great
champion
was
subjected
the
crisis
in
destiny
had
come
the
glitter
of
the
golden
bribe
was
in
his
eye
the
sound
of
titled
magnificence
was
in
his
ear
the
choice
was
before
him
to
sit
high
among
the
honorable
the
titled
and
the
powerful
or
to
take
his
humble
seat
in
the
hall
of
stephen
as
the
irish
demagogue
the
agitator
the
kerry
representative
he
did
not
hesitate
in
his
choice
on
the
first
occasion
that
offered
he
told
the
story
of
ireland
wrongs
and
demanded
justice
in
the
name
of
his
suffering
constituents
he
had
put
his
hand
to
the
plough
of
reform
and
he
could
not
relinquish
his
hold
for
his
heart
was
with
it
determined
to
give
the
whig
administration
no
excuse
for
neglecting
the
redress
of
irish
grievances
he
entered
heart
and
soul
into
the
great
measure
of
english
reform
and
his
zeal
tact
and
eloquence
contributed
not
a
little
to
its
success
yet
even
his
friends
speak
of
his
first
efforts
in
the
house
of
commons
as
failures
the
irish
accent
the
harsh
avowal
of
purposes
smacking
of
rebellion
the
eccentricities
and
flowery
luxuriance
of
an
eloquence
nursed
in
the
fervid
atmosphere
of
ireland
suddenly
transplanted
to
the
cold
and
commonplace
one
of
stephen
the
great
and
illiberal
prejudices
against
him
scarcely
abated
from
what
they
were
when
as
the
member
from
clare
he
was
mobbed
on
his
way
to
london
for
a
time
opposed
a
barrier
to
the
influence
of
his
talents
and
patriotism
but
he
triumphed
at
last
the
of
clare
and
kerry
the
declaimer
in
the
dublin
rooms
of
the
political
and
trades
union
became
one
of
the
most
attractive
and
popular
speakers
of
the
british
parliament
one
whose
aid
has
been
courted
and
whose
rebuke
has
been
feared
by
the
ablest
of
england
representatives
amid
the
sneers
of
derision
and
the
clamor
of
hate
and
prejudice
he
has
triumphed
on
that
very
arena
so
fatal
to
irish
eloquence
and
irish
fame
where
even
grattan
failed
to
sustain
himself
and
the
impetuous
spirit
of
flood
was
stricken
down
no
subject
in
which
ireland
was
not
directly
interested
has
received
a
greater
share
of
attention
than
that
of
the
abolition
of
colonial
slavery
utterly
detesting
tyranny
of
all
kinds
he
poured
forth
his
eloquent
soul
in
stern
reprobation
of
a
system
full
at
once
of
pride
and
misery
and
oppression
and
darkened
with
blood
his
speech
on
the
motion
of
thomas
fowell
buxton
for
the
immediate
emancipation
of
the
slaves
gave
a
new
tone
to
the
discussion
of
the
question
he
entered
into
no
petty
pecuniary
details
no
miserable
computation
of
the
shillings
and
pence
vested
in
beings
fashioned
in
the
image
of
god
he
did
not
talk
of
the
expediency
of
continuing
the
evil
because
it
had
grown
monstrous
to
use
his
own
words
he
considered
slavery
a
crime
to
be
abolished
not
merely
an
evil
to
be
palliated
he
left
sir
robert
peel
and
the
tories
to
eulogize
the
characters
and
defend
the
interests
of
the
planters
in
common
with
those
of
a
priesthood
building
their
houses
by
oppression
and
their
chambers
by
wrong
and
spoke
of
the
negro
interest
the
negro
claim
to
justice
demanding
sympathy
for
the
plundered
as
well
as
the
plunderers
for
the
slave
as
well
as
his
master
he
trampled
as
dust
under
his
feet
the
blasphemy
that
obedience
to
the
law
of
eternal
justice
is
a
principle
to
be
acknowledged
in
theory
only
because
unsafe
in
practice
he
would
he
said
enter
into
no
compromise
with
slavery
he
cared
not
what
cast
or
creed
or
color
it
might
assume
whether
personal
or
political
intellectual
or
spiritual
he
was
for
its
total
immediate
abolition
he
was
for
justice
justice
in
the
name
of
humanity
and
according
to
the
righteous
law
of
the
living
god
ardently
admiring
our
free
institutions
and
constantly
pointing
to
our
glorious
political
exaltation
as
an
incentive
to
the
perseverance
of
his
own
countrymen
in
their
struggle
against
oppression
he
has
yet
omitted
no
opportunity
of
rebuking
our
inexcusable
slave
system
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
jefferson
he
has
often
regretted
that
his
practice
should
have
so
illy
accorded
with
his
noble
sentiments
on
the
subject
of
slavery
which
so
fully
coincided
with
his
own
in
truth
wherever
man
has
been
oppressed
by
his
sympathy
has
been
directed
to
italy
chained
above
the
very
grave
of
her
ancient
liberties
to
the
republics
of
southern
america
to
greece
dashing
the
foot
of
the
indolent
ottoman
from
her
neck
to
france
and
belgium
and
last
not
least
to
poland
driven
from
her
cherished
nationality
and
dragged
like
his
own
ireland
bleeding
and
violated
to
the
deadly
embrace
of
her
oppressor
american
slavery
but
shares
in
his
common
denunciation
of
all
tyranny
its
victims
but
partake
of
his
common
pity
for
the
oppressed
and
persecuted
and
the
trodden
down
in
this
hasty
and
imperfect
sketch
we
can
not
enter
into
the
details
of
that
cruel
disregard
of
irish
rights
which
was
manifested
by
a
reformed
parliament
convoked
to
use
the
language
of
william
to
ascertain
the
sense
of
the
people
it
is
perhaps
enough
to
say
that
indignant
refusal
to
receive
as
full
justice
the
measure
of
reform
meted
out
to
ireland
was
fully
justified
by
the
facts
of
the
case
the
irish
reform
bill
gave
ireland
with
one
third
of
the
entire
population
of
the
united
kingdoms
only
one
sixth
of
the
parliamentary
delegation
it
diminished
instead
of
increasing
the
number
of
voters
in
the
towns
and
cities
it
created
a
high
and
aristocratic
franchise
in
many
boroughs
it
established
so
narrow
a
basis
of
franchise
as
to
render
them
liable
to
corruption
and
abuse
as
the
rotten
boroughs
of
the
old
system
it
threw
no
new
power
into
the
hands
of
the
people
and
with
no
little
justice
has
himself
termed
it
an
act
to
restore
to
power
the
orange
ascendancy
in
ireland
and
to
enable
a
faction
to
trample
with
impunity
on
the
friends
of
reform
and
constitutional
freedom
letters
to
the
reformers
of
great
britain
no
in
may
commenced
the
publication
of
his
celebrated
to
the
reformers
of
great
like
tallien
before
the
french
convention
he
rent
away
the
veil
which
hume
and
atwood
had
only
partially
lifted
he
held
up
before
the
people
of
great
britain
the
new
indignities
which
had
been
added
to
the
long
catalogue
of
wrongs
he
appealed
to
their
justice
their
honor
their
duty
for
redress
and
cast
down
before
the
whig
administration
the
gauntlet
of
his
country
defiance
and
scorn
there
is
a
fine
burst
of
indignant
irish
feeling
in
the
concluding
paragraphs
of
his
fourth
letter
i
have
demonstrated
the
contumelious
injuries
inflicted
upon
us
by
this
reform
bill
my
letters
are
long
before
the
public
they
have
been
unrefuted
uncontradicted
in
any
of
their
details
and
with
this
case
of
atrocious
injustice
to
ireland
placed
before
the
reformers
of
great
britain
what
assistance
what
sympathy
do
we
receive
why
i
have
got
some
half
dozen
drivelling
letters
from
political
unions
and
political
characters
asking
me
whether
i
advise
them
to
petition
or
bestir
themselves
in
our
behalf
reformers
of
great
britain
i
do
not
ask
you
either
to
petition
or
be
silent
i
do
not
ask
you
to
petition
or
to
do
any
other
act
in
favor
of
the
irish
you
will
consult
your
own
feelings
of
justice
and
generosity
unprovoked
by
any
advice
or
entreaty
of
mine
for
my
own
part
i
never
despaired
of
ireland
i
do
not
i
will
not
i
can
not
despair
of
my
beloved
country
she
has
in
my
view
obtained
freedom
of
conscience
for
others
as
well
as
for
herself
she
has
shaken
off
the
incubus
of
tithes
while
silly
legislation
was
dealing
out
its
folly
and
its
falsehoods
she
can
and
she
will
obtain
for
herself
justice
and
constitutional
freedom
and
although
she
may
sigh
at
british
neglect
and
ingratitude
there
is
no
sound
of
despair
in
that
sigh
nor
any
want
of
moral
energy
on
her
part
to
attain
her
own
rights
by
peaceable
and
legal
means
the
tithe
system
unutterably
odious
and
full
of
all
injustice
had
prepared
the
way
for
this
expression
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
people
ireland
had
never
in
any
period
of
her
history
bowed
her
neck
peaceably
to
the
ecclesiastical
yoke
from
the
canon
of
cashel
prepared
by
english
deputies
in
the
twelfth
century
decreeing
for
the
first
time
that
tithes
should
be
paid
in
ireland
down
to
the
present
moment
the
church
in
her
borders
has
relied
solely
upon
the
strong
arm
of
the
law
and
literally
reaped
its
tithes
with
the
sword
the
decree
of
the
dublin
synod
under
archbishop
comyn
in
could
only
be
enforced
within
the
pale
of
the
english
settlement
the
attempts
of
henry
viii
also
failed
without
the
pale
all
endeavors
to
collect
tithes
were
met
by
stern
opposition
and
although
from
the
time
of
william
iii
the
tithe
system
has
been
established
in
ireland
yet
at
no
period
has
it
been
regarded
otherwise
than
as
a
system
of
legalized
robbery
by
seven
eighths
of
the
people
an
examination
of
this
system
can
not
fail
to
excite
our
wonder
not
that
it
has
been
thus
regarded
but
that
it
has
been
so
long
endured
by
any
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
least
of
all
by
irishmen
tithes
to
the
amount
of
are
annually
wrung
from
impoverished
ireland
in
support
of
a
clergy
who
can
only
number
about
one
sixteenth
of
her
population
as
their
hearers
and
wrung
too
in
an
undue
proportion
from
the
catholic
counties
see
doyle
evidence
before
hon
g
stanley
in
the
southern
and
middle
counties
almost
entirely
inhabited
by
the
catholic
peasantry
every
thing
they

beastly

political

full

full

when
they
are
not
his
slaves
ever
the
dirt
under

feet
or
a

to

for
the
evils
of
absenteeism
the
of
the
wealthy
landholders
draining
from
a
starving
country
the
very
necessaries
of
life
a
remedy
is
sought
in
a
repeal
of
the
union
and
the
provisions
of
a
domestic
parliament
in
view
a
restoration
of
such
a
parliament
can
alone
afford
that
adequate
protection
to
the
national
industry
so
loudly
demanded
by
thousands
of
unemployed
laborers
starving
amid
the
ruins
of
deserted
manufactories
during
the
brief
period
of
partial
irish
liberty
which
followed
the
pacific
revolution
of
the

of
the
country

and
flourished
and
the
smile
of
contented
industry
was
visible
all
over
the
land
in
there
were
in
the
city
of
dublin
alone
there
are
now
but
such
is
the
practical
effect
of
the
union
of
that
suicidal
act
of
the
irish
parliament
which
yielded
up
in
a
moment
of
treachery
and
terror
the
dearest
interests
of
the
country
to
the
legislation
of
an
english
parliament
and
the
tender
mercies
of
castlereagh
of
that
castlereagh
who
when
accused
by
grattan
of
spending
in
purchasing
votes
for
the
union
replied
with
the
rare
audacity
of
iniquity
we
did
spend
and
we
would
have
spent
if
necessary
to
carry
the
union
that
castlereagh
who
when
irishmen
petitioned
against
the
union
and
for
it
maintained
that
the
latter
constituted
the
majority
well
has
it
been
said
that
the
deep
vengeance
which
ireland
owed
him
was
inflicted
by
the
great
criminal
upon
himself
the
nation
which
he
sold
and
plundered
saw
him
make
with
his
own
hand
the
fearful
retribution
the
great
body
of
the
irish
people
never
assented
to
the
union
the
following
extract
from
a
speech
of
earl
then
grey
in
upon
the
union
question
will
show
what
means
were
made
use
of
to
drag
ireland
while
yet
mourning
over
her
slaughtered
children
to
the
marriage
altar
with
england
if
the
parliament
of
ireland
had
been
left
to
itself
untempted
and
unawed
it
would
without
hesitation
have
rejected
the
resolutions
out
of
the
members
strenuously
opposed
the
measure
voted
for
it
of
these
were
placemen
some
of
them
were
english
generals
on
the
staff
without
a
foot
of
ground
in
ireland
and
completely
dependent
on
government
let
us
reflect
upon
the
arts
made
use
of
since
the
last
session
of
the
irish
parliament
to
pack
a
majority
for
union
in
the
house
of
commons
all
persons
holding
offices
under
government
if
they
hesitated
to
vote
as
directed
were
stripped
of
all
their
employments
a
bill
framed
for
preserving
the
purity
of
parliament
was
likewise
abused
and
no
less
than
seats
were
vacated
by
their
holders
having
received
nominal
offices
the
signs
of
the
times
are
most
favorable
to
the
success
of
the
irish
liberator
the
tremendous
power
of
the
english
political
unions
is
beginning
to
develop
itself
in
favor
of
ireland
a
deep
sympathy
is
evinced
for
her
sufferings
and
a
general
determination
to
espouse
her
cause
brute
force
can
not
put
down
the
peaceable
and
legal
agitation
of
the
question
of
her
rights
and
interests
the
spirit
of
the
age
forbids
it
the
agitation
will
go
on
for
it
is
spreading
among
men
who
to
use
the
words
of
the
eloquent
shiel
while
looking
out
upon
the
ocean
and
gazing
upon
the
shore
which
nature
has
guarded
with
so
many
of
her
bulwarks
can
hear
the
language
of
repeal
muttered
in
the
dashing
of
the
very
waves
which
separate
them
from
great
britain
by
a
barrier
of
own
creation
another
bloodless
victory
we
trust
awaits
a
victory
worthy
of
his
heart
and
intellect
unstained
by
one
drop
of
human
blood
unmoistened
by
a
solitary
tear
ireland
will
be
redeemed
and
disenthralled
not
perhaps
by
a
repeal
of
the
union
but
by
the
accomplishment
of
such
a
thorough
reform
in
the
government
and
policy
of
great
britain
as
shall
render
a
repeal
unnecessary
and
impolitic
the
sentiments
of
in
regard
to
the
means
of
effecting
his
object
of
political
reform
are
distinctly
impressed
upon
all
his
appeals
to
the
people
in
his
letter
of
december
to
the
dublin
trades
union
he
says
the
repealers
must
not
have
our
cause
stained
with
blood
far
indeed
from
it
we
can
and
ought
to
carry
the
repeal
only
in
the
total
absence
of
offence
against
the
laws
of
man
or
crime
in
the
sight
of
god
the
best
revolution
which
was
ever
effected
could
not
be
worth
one
drop
of
human
blood
in
his
speech
at
the
public
dinner
given
him
by
the
citizens
of
cork
we
find
a
yet
more
earnest
avowal
of
pacific
principles
it
may
be
stated
said
he
to
countervail
our
efforts
that
this
struggle
will
involve
the
destruction
of
life
and
property
that
it
will
overturn
the
framework
of
civil
society
and
give
an
undue
and
fearful
influence
to
one
rank
to
the
ruin
of
all
others
these
are
awful
considerations
truly
if
risked
i
am
one
of
those
who
have
always
believed
that
any
political
change
is
too
dearly
purchased
by
a
single
drop
of
blood
and
who
think
that
any
political
superstructure
based
upon
other
opinion
is
like
the
fabric
beautiful
in
the
brief
hour
of
sunshine
but
the
moment
one
drop
of
rain
touches
the
arid
basis
melting
away
in
wreck
and
ruin
i
am
an
accountable
being
i
have
a
soul
and
a
god
to
answer
to
in
another
and
better
world
for
my
thoughts
and
actions
in
this
i
disclaim
here
any
act
of
mine
which
would
sport
with
the
lives
of
my
any
amelioration
of
our
social
condition
which
must
be
purchased
by
their
blood
and
here
in
the
face
of
god
and
of
our
common
country
i
protest
that
if
i
did
not
sincerely
and
firmly
believe
that
the
amelioration
i
desire
could
be
effected
without
violence
without
any
change
in
the
relative
scale
of
ranks
in
the
present
social
condition
of
ireland
except
that
change
which
all
must
desire
making
each
better
than
it
was
before
and
cementing
all
in
one
solid
irresistible
mass
i
would
at
once
give
up
the
struggle
which
i
have
always
kept
with
tyranny
i
would
withdraw
from
the
contest
which
i
have
hitherto
waged
with
those
who
would
perpetuate
our
thraldom
i
would
not
for
one
moment
dare
to
venture
for
that
which
in
costing
one
human
life
would
cost
infinitely
too
dear
but
it
will
cost
no
such
price
have
we
not
had
within
my
memory
two
great
political
revolutions
and
had
we
them
not
without
bloodshed
or
violence
to
the
social
compact
have
we
not
arrived
at
a
period
when
physical
force
and
military
power
yield
to
moral
and
intellectual
energy
has
not
the
time
of
arma
togae
come
for
us
and
the
other
nations
of
the
earth
let
us
trust
that
the
prediction
of
will
be
verified
that
reason
and
intellect
are
destined
under
god
to
do
that
for
the
nations
of
the
earth
which
the
physical
force
of
centuries
and
the
red
sacrifice
of
a
thousand
have
failed
to
accomplish
glorious
beyond
all
others
will
be
the
day
when
nation
shall
no
more
rise
up
against
nation
when
as
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
universal
acknowledgment
of
the
rights
of
man
it
shall
no
longer
be
in
the
power
of
an
individual
to
drag
millions
into
strife
for
the
unholy
gratification
of
personal
prejudice
and
passion
the
reformed
governments
of
great
britain
and
france
resting
as
they
do
upon
a
popular
basis
are
already
tending
to
this
consummation
for
the
people
have
suffered
too
much
from
the
warlike
ambition
of
their
former
masters
not
to
have
learned
that
the
gains
of
peaceful
industry
are
better
than
the
wages
of
human
butchery

the
great
names
of

widely
dissimilar

and
the

down
the
modern
alexander

of

but
the
page
of
his

is
dim
with
the

of

and
dark
with
the
stain
of

the

only
with
the

has
triumphed
over
the
oppression
of
centuries
and
opened
a
peaceful
pathway
to
the
temple
of
freedom
through
which
its
goddess
may
be
seen
no

propitiated
with
human

unravel

mysteries

of

attempts
have
been
made
to
prejudice

by
a
republication
on
this
side

for

england
under
james
ii
a
review
of
the
first
two
volumes
of
macaulay
of
england
from
the
accession
of
james
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
we
have
in
these
volumes
an
admirable
example
of
history
made
easy
had
they
been
published
in
his
time
they
might
have
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
poet
gray
who
declared
that
his
ideal
of
happiness
was
to
lie
on
a
sofa
and
read
eternal
new
romances
the
style
is
that
which
lends
such
a
charm
to
the
author
essays
brilliant
epigrammatic
vigorous
indeed
herein
lies
the
fault
of
the
work
when
viewed
as
a
mere
detail
of
historical
facts
its
sparkling
rhetoric
is
not
the
safest
medium
of
truth
to
the
inquirer
a
discriminating
and
able
critic
has
done
the
author
no
injustice
in
saying
that
in
attempting
to
give
effect
and
vividness
to
his
thoughts
and
diction
he
is
often
overstrained
and
extravagant
and
that
his
epigrammatic
style
seems
better
fitted
for
the
glitter
of
paradox
than
the
sober
guise
of
truth
the
intelligent
and
reader
of
the
volume
before
us
will
find
himself
at
times
compelled
to
reverse
the
decisions
of
the
author
and
deliver
some
unfortunate
personage
sect
or
class
from
the
pillory
of
his
rhetoric
and
the
merciless
pelting
of
his
ridicule
there
is
a
want
of
the
repose
and
quiet
which
we
look
for
in
a
narrative
of
events
long
passed
away
we
rise
from
the
perusal
of
the
book
pleased
and
excited
but
with
not
so
clear
a
conception
of
the
actual
realities
of
which
it
treats
as
would
be
desirable
we
can
not
help
feeling
that
the
author
has
been
somewhat
in
avoiding
the
dulness
of
plain
detail
and
the
dryness
of
dates
names
and
statistics
the
freedom
flowing
diction
and
sweeping
generality
of
the
reviewer
and
essayist
are
maintained
throughout
and
with
one
remarkable
exception
the
of
might
be
divided
into
papers
of
magazine
length
and
published
without
any
violence
to
propriety
as
a
continuation
of
the
author
labors
in
that
department
of
literature
in
which
he
confessedly
stands
without
a
rival
historical
review
that
exception
is
however
no
unimportant
one
in
our
view
it
is
the
crowning
excellence
of
the
first
volume
its
distinctive
feature
and
principal
attraction
we
refer
to
the
third
chapter
of
the
volume
from
page
to
page
the
description
of
the
condition
of
england
at
the
period
of
the
accession
of
james
ii
we
know
of
nothing
like
it
in
the
entire
range
of
historical
literature
the
veil
is
lifted
up
from
the
england
of
a
century
and
a
half
ago
its
geographical
industrial
social
and
moral
condition
is
revealed
and
as
the
panorama
passes
before
us
of
lonely
heaths
fortified
bands
of
robbers
rude
country
squires
doling
out
the
odds
and
ends
of
their
coarse
fare
to
clerical
dependents
rough
roads
serviceable
only
for
horseback
travelling
towns
with
unlighted
streets
reeking
with
filth
and
offal
and
prisons
damp
loathsome
infected
with
disease
and
swarming
with
vermin
we
are
filled
with
wonder
at
the
contrast
which
it
presents
to
the
england
of
our
day
we
no
longer
sigh
for
the
good
old
days
the
most
confirmed
grumbler
is
compelled
to
admit
that
bad
as
things
now
are
they
were
far
worse
a
few
generations
back
macaulay
in
this
elaborate
and
carefully
prepared
chapter
has
done
a
good
service
to
humanity
in
disabusing
ignorance
of
the
melancholy
notion
that
the
world
is
growing
worse
and
in
putting
to
silence
the
cant
of
blind
unreasoning
conservatism
in
the
entire
population
of
england
our
author
estimates
at
from
five
millions
to
five
millions
five
hundred
thousand
of
the
eight
hundred
thousand
families
at
that
period
one
half
had
animal
food
twice
a
week
the
other
half
ate
it
not
at
all
or
at
most
not
oftener
than
once
a
week
wheaten
loaves
were
only
seen
at
the
tables
of
the
comparatively
wealthy
rye
barley
and
oats
were
the
food
of
the
vast
majority
the
average
wages
of
workingmen
was
at
least
one
half
less
than
is
paid
in
england
for
the
same
service
at
the
present
day
one
fifth
of
the
people
were
paupers
or
recipients
of
parish
relief
clothing
and
bedding
were
scarce
and
dear
education
was
almost
unknown
to
the
vast
majority
the
houses
and
shops
were
not
numbered
in
the
cities
for
porters
coachmen
and
could
not
read
the
shopkeeper
distinguished
his
place
of
business
by
painted
signs
and
graven
images
oxford
and
cambridge
universities
were
little
better
than
modern
grammar
and
latin
school
in
a
provincial
village
the
country
magistrate
used
on
the
bench
language
too
coarse
brutal
and
vulgar
for
a
modern

vied
with

in
the
lowest
ribaldry
and
the
grossest
profanity
the
poets
of
the
time
from
dryden
to
durfey
ministered
to
the
popular
licentiousness
the
most
shameless
indecency
polluted
their
pages
the
theatre
and
the
brothel
were
in
strict
unison
the
church
winked
at
the
vice
which
opposed
itself
to
the
austere
morality
or
hypocrisy
of
puritanism
the
superior
clergy
with
a
few
noble
exceptions
were
and
courtiers
the
inferior
were
idle
ignorant
hangerson
upon
blaspheming
squires
and
knights
of
the
shire
the
domestic
chaplain
of
all
men
living
held
the
most
unenviable
position
if
he
was
permitted
to
dine
with
the
family
he
was
expected
to
content
himself
with
the
plainest
fare
he
might
fill
himself
with
the
corned
beef
and
carrots
but
as
soon
as
the
tarts
and
made
their
appearance
he
quitted
his
seat
and
stood
aloof
till
he
was
summoned
to
return
thanks
for
the
repast
from
a
great
part
of
which
he
had
been
excluded
beyond
the
trent
the
country
seems
at
this
period
to
have
been
in
a
state
of
barbarism
the
parishes
kept
bloodhounds
for
the
purpose
of
hunting
freebooters
the
were
fortified
and
guarded
so
dangerous
was
the
country
that
persons
about
travelling
thither
made
their
wills
judges
and
lawyers
only
ventured
therein
escorted
by
a
strong
guard
of
armed
men
the
natural
resources
of
the
island
were
undeveloped
the
tin
mines
of
cornwall
which
two
thousand
years
before
attracted
the
ships
of
the
merchant
princes
of
tyre
beyond
the
pillars
of
hercules
were
indeed
worked
to
a
considerable
extent
but
the
copper
mines
which
now
yield
annually
fifteen
thousand
tons
were
entirely
neglected
rock
salt
was
known
to
exist
but
was
not
used
to
any
considerable
extent
and
only
a
partial
supply
of
salt
by
evaporation
was
obtained
the
coal
and
iron
of
england
are
at
this
time
the
stable
foundations
of
her
industrial
and
commercial
greatness
but
in
the
great
part
of
the
iron
used
was
imported
only
about
ten
thousand
tons
were
annually
cast
now
eight
hundred
thousand
is
the
average
annual
production
equally
great
has
been
the
increase
in
coal
mining
coal
says
macaulay
though
very
little
used
in
any
species
of
manufacture
was
already
the
ordinary
fuel
in
some
districts
which
were
fortunate
enough
to
possess
large
beds
and
in
the
capital
which
could
easily
be
supplied
by
water
carriage
it
seems
reasonable
to
believe
that
at
least
one
half
of
the
quantity
then
extracted
from
the
pits
was
consumed
in
london
the
consumption
of
london
seemed
to
the
writers
of
that
age
enormous
and
was
often
mentioned
by
them
as
a
proof
of
the
greatness
of
the
imperial
city
they
scarcely
hoped
to
be
believed
when
they
affirmed
that
two
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
chaldrons
that
is
to
say
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
in
the
last
year
of
the
reign
of
charles
brought
to
the
thames
at
present
near
three
millions
and
a
half
of
tons
are
required
yearly
by
the
metropolis
and
the
whole
annual
produce
can
not
on
the
most
moderate
computation
be
estimated
at
less
than
twenty
millions
of
tons
after
thus
passing
in
survey
the
england
of
our
ancestors
five
or
six
generations
back
the
author
closes
his
chapter
with
some
eloquent
remarks
upon
the
progress
of
society
contrasting
the
hardness
and
coarseness
of
the
age
of
which
he
treats
with
the
softer
and
more
humane
features
of
our
own
he
says
nowhere
could
be
found
that
sensitive
and
restless
compassion
which
has
in
our
time
extended
powerful
protection
to
the
factory
child
the
hindoo
widow
to
the
negro
slave
which
pries
into
the
stores
and
of
every
emigrant
ship
which
winces
at
every
lash
laid
on
the
back
of
a
drunken
soldier
which
will
not
suffer
the
thief
in
the
hulks
to
be
ill
fed
or
overworked
and
which
has
repeatedly
endeavored
to
save
the
life
even
of
the
murderer
the
more
we
study
the
annals
of
the
past
the
more
shall
we
rejoice
that
we
live
in
a
merciful
age
in
an
age
in
which
cruelty
is
abhorred
and
in
which
pain
even
when
deserved
is
inflicted
reluctantly
and
from
a
sense
of
duty
every
class
doubtless
has
gained
largely
by
this
great
moral
change
but
the
class
which
has
gained
most
is
the
poorest
the
most
dependent
and
the
most
defenceless
the
history
itself
properly
commences
at
the
close
of
this
chapter
opening
with
the
deathscene
of
the
dissolute
charles
it
presents
a
series
of
brilliant
pictures
of
the
events
succeeding
the
miserable
fate
of
oates
and
dangerfield
the
perjured
inventors
of
the
popish
plot
the
trial
of
baxter
by
the
infamous
jeffreys
the
attempt
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
the
battle
of
sedgemoor
and
the
dreadful
atrocities
of
the
king
soldiers
and
the
horrible
perversion
of
justice
by
the
chief
judge
in
the
bloody
assizes
the
barbarous
hunting
of
the
scotch
dissenters
by
claverbouse
the
melancholy
fate
of
the
brave
and
noble
duke
of
argyle
are
described
with
graphic
power
unknown
to
smollett
or
hume
personal
portraits
are
sketched
with
a
bold
freedom
which
at
times
startles
us
the
old
familiar
faces
as
we
have
seen
them
through
the
dust
of
a
century
and
a
half
start
before
us
with
lifelike
distinctness
of
outline
and
coloring
some
of
them
disappoint
us
like
the
ghost
of
hamlet
father
they
come
in
a
questionable
shape
thus
for
instance
in
his
sketch
of
william
penn
the
historian
takes
issue
with
the
world
on
his
character
and
labors
through
many
pages
of
disingenuous
innuendoes
and
distortion
of
facts
to
transform
the
saint
of
history
into
a
pliant
courtier
the
second
volume
details
the
follies
and
misfortunes
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
last
of
the
stuarts
all
the
art
of
the
author
splendid
rhetoric
is
employed
in
awakening
by
turns
the
indignation
and
contempt
of
the
reader
in
contemplating
the
character
of
the
king
in
portraying
that
character
he
has
brought
into
exercise
all
those
powers
of
invective
and
merciless
ridicule
which
give
such
a
savage
relish
to
his
delineation
of
barrere
to
preserve
the
consistency
of
this
character
he
denies
the
king
any
credit
for
whatever
was
really
beneficent
and
praiseworthy
in
his
government
he
holds
up
the
royal
delinquent
in
only
two
lights
the
one
representing
him
as
a
tyrant
towards
his
people
the
other
as
the
abject
slave
of
foreign
priests
a
man
at
once
hateful
and
ludicrous
of
whom
it
is
difficult
to
speak
without
an
execration
or
a
sneer
the
events
which
preceded
the
revolution
of
the
undisguised
adherence
of
the
king
to
the
church
of
rome
the
partial
toleration
of
the
despised
quakers
and
anabaptists
the
gradual
relaxation
of
the
severity
of
the
penal
laws
against
papists
and
dissenters
preparing
the
way
for
the
royal
proclamation
of
entire
liberty
of
conscience
throughout
the
british
realm
allowing
the
puritan
and
the
papist
priest
to
build
conventicles
and
mass
houses
under
the
very
eaves
of
the
palaces
of
oxford
and
canterbury
the
mining
and
countermining
of
jesuits
and
prelates
are
detailed
with
impartial
minuteness
the
secret
springs
of
the
great
movements
of
the
time
are
laid
bare
the
mean
and
paltry
instrumentalities
are
seen
at
work
in
the
under
world
of
corruption
prejudice
and
falsehood
no
one
save
a
blind
unreasoning
partisan
of
catholicism
or
episcopacy
can
contemplate
this
chapter
in
english
history
without
a
feeling
of
disgust
however
it
may
have
been
overruled
for
good
by
that
providence
which
takes
the
wise
in
their
own
craftiness
the
revolution
of
in
itself
considered
affords
just
as
little
cause
for
on
the
part
of
protestants
as
the
substitution
of
the
supremacy
of
the
crowned
bluebeard
henry
for
that
of
the
pope
in
the
english
church
it
had
little
in
common
with
the
revolution
of
the
field
of
its
action
was
the
closet
of
selfish
intrigue
the
stalls
of
discontented
prelates
the
chambers
of
the
wanton
and
adulteress
the
confessional
of
a
weak
prince
whose
mind
originally
narrow
had
been
cramped
closer
still
by
the
jacket
of
religious
bigotry
and
superstition
the
age
of
nobility
and
heroism
had
passed
away
the
pious
fervor
the
and
the
strict
morality
of
the
puritanism
of
the
days
of
cromwell
and
the
blunt
honesty
and
chivalrous
loyalty
of
the
cavaliers
had
both
measurably
given
place
to
the
corrupting
influences
of
the
licentious
and
infidel
court
of
charles
ii
and
to
the
arrogance
intolerance
and
shameless
of
a
prelacy
which
in
its
day
of
triumph
and
revenge
had
more
than
justified
the
terrible
denunciations
and
scathing
gibes
of
milton
both
catholic
and
protestant
writers
have
misrepresented
james
ii
he
deserves
neither
the
execrations
of
the
one
nor
the
eulogies
of
the
other
the
candid
historian
must
admit
that
he
was
after
all
a
better
man
than
his
brother
charles
ii
he
was
a
sincere
and
bigoted
catholic
and
was
undoubtedly
honest
in
the
declaration
which
he
made
in
that
unlucky
letter
which
burnet
ferreted
out
on
the
continent
that
he
was
prepared
to
make
large
steps
to
build
up
the
catholic
church
in
england
and
if
necessary
to
become
a
martyr
in
her
cause
he
was
proud
austere
and
in
the
treatment
of
his
enemies
he
partook
of
the
cruel
temper
of
his
time
he
was
at
once
ascetic
and
sensual
alternating
between
the
of
penance
and
the
embraces
of
catharine
sedley
his
situation
was
one
of
the
most
difficult
and
embarrassing
which
can
be
conceived
of
he
was
at
once
a
bigoted
papist
and
a
protestant
pope
he
hated
the
french
domination
to
which
his
brother
had
submitted
yet
his
pride
as
sovereign
was
subordinated
to
his
allegiance
to
rome
and
a
superstitious
veneration
for
the
wily
priests
with
which
louis
xiv
surrounded
him
as
the
head
of
anglican
heretics
he
was
compelled
to
submit
to
conditions
galling
alike
to
the
sovereign
and
the
man
he
found
on
his
accession
the
terrible
penal
laws
against
the
papists
in
full
force
the
hangman
knife
was
yet
warm
with
its
ghastly
of
quartering
and
disembowelling
suspected
jesuits
and
victims
of
the
lie
of
titus
oates
the
tower
of
london
had
scarcely
ceased
to
echo
the
groans
of
catholic
confessors
stretched
on
the
rack
by
protestant
inquisitors
he
was
torn
by
conflicting
interests
and
spiritual
and
political
contradictions
the
prelates
of
the
established
church
must
share
the
responsibility
of
many
of
the
worst
acts
of
the
early
part
of
his
reign
oxford
sent
up
its
lawned
deputations
to
mingle
the
voice
of
adulation
with
the
groans
of
tortured
covenanters
and
fawning
ecclesiastics
burned
the
incense
of
irreverent
flattery
under
the
nostrils
of
the
lord
anointed
while
the
blessed
air
of
england
was
tainted
by
the
carcasses
of
the
followers
of
monmouth
rotting
on
a
thousand
gibbets
while
jeffreys
was
threatening
baxter
and
his
presbyterian
friends
with
the
pillory
and
while
quakers
and
baptists
were
only
spared
from
extermination
as
game
preserves
for
the
sport
of
clerical
hunters
while
the
prisons
were
thronged
with
the
heads
of
some
fifteen
thousand
beggared
families
and
dissenters
of
every
name
and
degree
were
chased
from
one
to
another
like
david
among
the
cliffs
of
ziph
and
the
rocks
of
the
wild
goats
the
thanksgivings
and
congratulations
of
prelacy
arose
in
an
unbroken
strain
of
laudation
from
all
the
episcopal
palaces
of
england
what
mattered
it
to
men
in
whose
hearts
to
use
the
language
of
john
milton
the
sour
leaven
of
human
traditions
mixed
with
the
poisonous
dregs
of
hypocrisy
lay
basking
in
the
sunny
warmth
of
wealth
and
promotion
hatching
antichrist
that
the
privileges
of
englishmen
and
the
rights
secured
by
the
great
charter
were
violated
and
trodden
under
foot
so
long
as
usurpation
enured
to
their
own
benefit
but
when
king
james
issued
his
declaration
of
indulgence
and
stretched
his
prerogative
on
the
side
of
tolerance
and
charity
the
zeal
of
the
prelates
for
preserving
the
integrity
of
the
british
constitution
and
the
limiting
of
the
royal
power
flamed
up
into
rebellion
they
forswore
themselves
without
scruple
the
disciples
of
laud
the
asserters
of
kingly
infallibility
and
divine
right
talked
of
usurped
power
and
english
rights
in
the
strain
of
the
very
schismatics
whom
they
had
persecuted
to
the
death
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
james
supposed
that
in
issuing
his
declaration
suspending
the
penal
laws
he
had
transcended
the
rightful
prerogative
of
his
throne
the
power
which
he
exercised
had
been
used
by
his
predecessors
for
far
less
worthy
purposes
and
with
the
approbation
of
many
of
the
very
men
who
now
opposed
him
his
ostensible
object
expressed
in
language
which
even
those
who
condemn
his
policy
can
not
but
admire
was
a
laudable
and
noble
one
we
trust
said
he
that
it
will
not
be
vain
that
we
have
resolved
to
use
our
utmost
endeavors
to
establish
liberty
of
conscience
on
such
just
and
equal
foundations
as
will
render
it
unalterable
and
secure
to
all
people
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
by
which
future
ages
may
reap
the
benefit
of
what
is
so
undoubtedly
the
general
good
of
the
whole
kingdom
whatever
may
have
been
the
motive
of
this
declaration
even
admitting
the
suspicions
of
his
enemies
to
have
been
true
that
he
advocated
universal
toleration
as
the
only
means
of
restoring
roman
catholics
to
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
which
the
penal
laws
deprived
them
it
would
seem
that
there
could
have
been
no
very
serious
objection
on
the
part
of
real
friends
of
religious
toleration
to
the
taking
of
him
at
his
word
and
placing
englishmen
of
every
sect
on
an
equality
before
the
law
the
catholics
were
in
a
very
small
minority
scarcely
at
that
time
as
numerous
as
the
quakers
and
anabaptists
the
army
the
navy
and
nine
tenths
of
the
people
of
england
were
protestants
real
danger
therefore
from
a
simple
act
of
justice
towards
their
catholic
citizens
the
people
of
england
had
no
ground
for
apprehending
but
the
great
truth
which
is
even
now
but
imperfectly
recognized
throughout
christendom
that
religious
opinions
rest
between
man
and
his
maker
and
not
between
man
and
the
magistrate
and
that
the
domain
of
conscience
is
sacred
was
almost
unknown
to
the
statesmen
and
schoolmen
of
the
seventeenth
century
milton
ultra
liberal
as
he
was
excepted
the
catholics
from
his
plan
of
toleration
locke
yielding
to
the
prejudices
of
the
time
took
the
same
ground
the
enlightened
latitudinarian
ministers
of
the
established
church
men
whose
talents
and
christian
charity
redeem
in
some
measure
the
character
of
that
church
in
the
day
of
its
greatest
power
and
basest
apostasy
stopped
short
of
universal
toleration
the
presbyterians
excluded
quakers
baptists
and
papists
from
the
pale
of
their
charity
with
the
single
exception
of
the
sect
of
which
william
penn
was
a
conspicuous
member
the
idea
of
complete
and
impartial
toleration
was
novel
and
unwelcome
to
all
sects
and
classes
of
the
english
people
hence
it
was
that
the
very
men
whose
liberties
and
estates
had
been
secured
by
the
declaration
and
who
were
thereby
permitted
to
hold
their
meetings
in
peace
and
quietness
used
their
newly
acquired
freedom
in
denouncing
the
king
because
the
same
key
which
had
opened
their
prison
doors
had
also
liberated
the
papists
and
the
quakers
baxter
severe
and
painful
spirit
could
not
rejoice
in
an
act
which
had
indeed
restored
him
to
personal
freedom
but
which
had
in
his
view
also
offended
heaven
and
strengthened
the
powers
of
antichrist
by
extending
the
same
favor
to
jesuits
and
ranters
bunyan
disliked
the
quakers
next
to
the
papists
and
it
greatly
lessened
his
satisfaction
at
his
release
from
bedford
jail
that
it
had
been
brought
about
by
the
influence
of
the
former
at
the
court
of
a
catholic
prince
dissenters
forgot
the
wrongs
and
persecutions
which
they
had
experienced
at
the
hands
of
the
prelacy
and
joined
the
bishops
in
opposition
to
the
declaration
they
almost
magnified
into
christian
confessors
the
prelates
who
remonstrated
against
the
indulgence
and
actually
plotted
against
the
king
for
restoring
them
to
liberty
of
person
and
conscience
the
nightmare
fear
of
popery
overcame
their
love
of
religious
liberty
and
they
meekly
offered
their
necks
to
the
yoke
of
prelacy
as
the
only
security
against
the
heavier
one
of
papist
supremacy
in
a
far
different
manner
the
cleareyed
and
john
milton
met
the
claims
and
demands
of
the
hierarchy
in
his
time
they
entreat
us
said
he
that
we
be
not
weary
of
the
insupportable
grievances
that
our
shoulders
have
hitherto
cracked
under
they
beseech
us
that
we
think
them
fit
to
be
our
justices
of
peace
our
lords
our
highest
officers
of
state
they
pray
us
that
it
would
please
us
to
let
them
still
haul
us
and
wrong
us
with
their
bandogs
and
pursuivants
and
that
it
would
please
the
parliament
that
they
may
yet
have
the
whipping
fleecing
and
flaying
of
us
in
their
diabolical
courts
to
tear
the
flesh
from
our
bones
and
into
our
wide
wounds
instead
of
balm
to
pour
in
the
oil
of
tartar
vitriol
and
mercury
surely
a
right
reasonable
innocent
and
petition
o
the
relenting
bowels
of
the
fathers
considering
the
prominent
part
acted
by
william
penn
in
the
reign
of
james
and
his
active
and
influential
support
of
the
obnoxious
declaration
which
precipitated
the
revolution
of
it
could
hardly
have
been
otherwise
than
that
his
character
should
suffer
from
the
unworthy
suspicions
and
prejudices
of
his
contemporaries
his
views
of
religious
toleration
were
too
far
in
advance
of
the
age
to
be
received
with
favor
they
were
of
necessity
misunderstood
and
misrepresented
all
his
life
he
had
been
urging
them
with
the
earnestness
of
one
whose
convictions
were
the
result
not
so
much
of
human
reason
as
of
what
he
regarded
as
divine
illumination
what
the
council
of
james
yielded
upon
grounds
of
state
policy
he
defended
on
those
of
religious
obligation
he
had
suffered
in
person
and
estate
for
the
exercise
of
his
religion
he
had
travelled
over
holland
and
germany
pleading
with
those
in
authority
for
universal
toleration
and
charity
on
a
sudden
on
the
accession
of
james
the
friend
of
himself
and
his
family
he
found
himself
the
most
influential
untitled
citizen
in
the
british
realm
he
had
free
access
to
the
royal
ear
asking
nothing
for
himself
or
his
relatives
he
demanded
only
that
the
good
people
of
england
should
be
no
longer
despoiled
of
liberty
and
estate
for
their
religious
opinions
james
as
a
catholic
had
in
some
sort
a
common
interest
with
his
dissenting
subjects
and
the
declaration
was
for
their
common
relief
penn
conscious
of
the
rectitude
of
his
own
motives
and
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
christian
duty
of
toleration
welcomed
that
declaration
as
the
precursor
of
the
golden
age
of
liberty
and
love
and
to
men
he
was
not
the
man
to
distrust
the
motives
of
an
act
so
fully
in
accordance
with
his
lifelong
aspirations
and
prayers
he
was
charitable
to
a
fault
his
faith
in
his
was
often
stronger
than
a
clearer
insight
of
their
characters
would
have
justified
he
saw
the
errors
of
the
king
and
deplored
them
he
denounced
jeffreys
as
a
butcher
who
had
been
let
loose
by
the
priests
and
pitied
the
king
who
was
he
thought
swayed
by
evil
counsels
he
remonstrated
against
the
interference
of
the
king
with
magdalen
college
and
reproved
and
rebuked
the
hopes
and
aims
of
the
more
zealous
and
catholics
advising
them
to
be
content
with
simple
toleration
but
the
constitution
of
his
mind
fitted
him
rather
for
the
commendation
of
the
good
than
the
denunciation
of
the
bad
he
had
little
in
common
with
the
bold
and
austere
spirit
of
the
puritan
reformers
he
disliked
their
violence
and
harshness
while
on
the
other
hand
he
was
attracted
and
pleased
by
the
gentle
disposition
and
mild
counsels
of
locke
and
tillotson
and
the
latitudinarians
of
the
english
church
he
was
the
intimate
personal
and
political
friend
of
algernon
sydney
sympathized
with
his
republican
theories
and
shared
his
abhorrence
of
tyranny
civil
and
ecclesiastical
he
found
in
him
a
man
after
his
own
heart
genial
generous
and
loving
faithful
to
duty
and
the
instincts
of
humanity
a
true
christian
gentleman
his
sense
of
gratitude
was
strong
and
his
personal
friendships
sometimes
clouded
his
judgment
in
giving
his
support
to
the
measures
of
james
in
behalf
of
liberty
of
conscience
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
acted
in
consistency
with
his
principles
and
professions
to
have
taken
ground
against
them
he
must
have
given
the
lie
to
his
declarations
from
his
youth
upward
he
could
not
disown
and
deny
his
own
favorite
doctrine
because
it
came
from
the
lips
of
a
catholic
king
and
his
jesuit
advisers
and
in
thus
rising
above
the
prejudices
of
his
time
and
appealing
to
the
reason
and
humanity
of
the
people
of
england
in
favor
of
a
cordial
indorsement
on
the
part
of
parliament
of
the
principles
of
the
declaration
he
believed
that
he
was
subserving
the
best
interests
of
his
beloved
country
and
fulfilling
the
solemn
obligations
of
religious
duty
the
downfall
of
james
exposed
penn
to
peril
and
obloquy
perjured
informers
endeavored
to
swear
away
his
life
and
although
nothing
could
be
proved
against
him
beyond
the
fact
that
he
had
steadily
supported
the
great
measure
of
toleration
he
was
compelled
to
live
secluded
in
his
private
lodgings
in
london
for
two
or
three
years
with
a
proclamation
for
his
arrest
hanging
over
his
head
at
length
the
principal
informer
against
him
having
been
found
guilty
of
perjury
the
government
warrant
was
withdrawn
and
lords
sidney
rochester
and
somers
and
the
duke
of
buckingham
publicly
bore
testimony
that
nothing
had
been
urged
against
him
save
by
impostors
and
that
they
had
known
him
some
of
them
for
thirty
years
and
had
never
known
him
to
do
an
ill
thing
but
many
good
offices
it
is
a
matter
of
regret
that
one
professing
to
hold
the
impartial
pen
of
history
should
have
given
the
sanction
of
his
authority
to
the
slanderous
and
false
imputations
of
such
a
man
as
burnet
who
has
never
been
regarded
as
an
authentic
chronicler
the
pantheon
of
history
should
not
be
lightly
disturbed
a
good
man
character
is
the
world
common
legacy
and
humanity
is
not
so
rich
in
models
of
purity
and
goodness
as
to
be
able
to
sacrifice
such
a
reputation
as
that
of
william
penn
to
the
point
of
an
antithesis
or
the
effect
of
a
paradox
gilbert
burnet
in
liberality
as
a
politician
and
tolerance
as
a
churchman
was
far
in
advance
of
his
order
and
time
it
is
true
that
he
shut
out
the
catholics
from
the
pale
of
his
charity
and
barely
tolerated
the
dissenters
the
idea
of
entire
religious
liberty
and
equality
shocked
even
his
moderate
degree
of
sensitiveness
he
met
penn
at
the
court
of
the
prince
of
orange
and
after
a
long
and
fruitless
effort
to
convince
the
dissenter
that
the
penal
laws
against
the
catholics
should
be
enforced
and
allegiance
to
the
established
church
continue
the
condition
of
qualification
for
offices
of
trust
and
honor
and
that
he
and
his
friends
should
rest
contented
with
simple
toleration
he
became
irritated
by
the
inflexible
adherence
of
penn
to
the
principle
of
entire
religious
freedom
one
of
the
most
worthy
sons
of
the
episcopal
church
thomas
clarkson
alluding
to
this
discussion
says
burnet
never
mentioned
him
penn
afterwards
but
coldly
or
sneeringly
or
in
a
way
to
lower
him
in
the
estimation
of
the
reader
whenever
he
had
occasion
to
speak
of
him
in
his
history
of
his
own
times
he
was
a
man
of
strong
prejudices
he
lived
in
the
midst
of
revolutions
plots
and
intrigues
he
saw
much
of
the
worst
side
of
human
nature
and
he
candidly
admits
in
the
preface
to
his
great
work
that
he
was
inclined
to
think
generally
the
worst
of
men
and
parties
and
that
the
reader
should
make
allowance
for
this
inclination
although
he
had
honestly
tried
to
give
the
truth
king
of
oxford
in
his
anecdotes
of
his
own
times
says
i
knew
burnet
he
was
a
furious
and
easily
imposed
upon
by
any
lying
spirit
of
his
faction
but
he
was
a
better
pastor
than
any
man
who
is
now
seated
on
the
bishops
bench
the
tory
writers
swift
pope
arbuthnot
and
others
have
undoubtedly
exaggerated
the
defects
of
burnet
narrative
while
on
the
other
hand
his
whig
commentators
have
excused
them
on
the
ground
of
his
avowed
and
fierce
partisanship
johnson
in
his
blunt
way
says
i
do
not
believe
burnet
intentionally
lied
but
he
was
so
much
prejudiced
that
he
took
no
pains
to
find
out
the
truth
on
the
contrary
sir
james
mackintosh
in
the
edinburgh
review
speaks
of
the
bishop
as
an
honest
writer
seldom
substantially
erroneous
though
often
inaccurate
in
points
of
detail
and
macaulay
who
has
quite
too
closely
followed
him
in
his
history
defends
him
as
at
least
quite
as
accurate
as
his
contemporary
writers
and
says
that
in
his
moral
character
as
in
his
intellectual
great
blemishes
were
more
than
compensated
by
great
excellences
the
border
war
of
the
picturesque
site
of
the
now
large
village
of
haverhill
on
the
merrimac
river
was
occupied
a
century
and
a
half
ago
by
some
thirty
dwellings
scattered
at
unequal
distances
along
the
two
principal
roads
one
of
which
running
parallel
with
the
river
intersected
the
other
which
ascended
the
hill
northwardly
and
lost
itself
in
the
dark
woods
the
log
huts
of
the
first
settlers
had
at
that
time
given
place
to
comparatively
spacious
and
commodious
habitations
framed
and
covered
with
sawed
boards
and
cloven
clapboards
or
shingles
they
were
many
of
them
two
stories
in
front
with
the
roof
sloping
off
behind
to
a
single
one
the
windows
few
and
small
and
frequently
so
fitted
as
to
be
opened
with
difficulty
and
affording
but
a
scanty
supply
of
light
and
air
two
or
three
of
the
best
constructed
were
occupied
as
garrisons
where
in
addition
to
the
family
small
companies
of
soldiers
were
quartered
on
the
high
grounds
rising
from
the
river
stood
the
mansions
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
little
settlement
larger
and
more
imposing
with
projecting
upper
stories
and
carved
cornices
on
the
front
of
one
of
these
over
the
elaborately
wrought
entablature
of
the
doorway
might
be
seen
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
honored
family
of
saltonstall
its
hospitable
door
was
now
closed
no
guests
filled
its
spacious
hall
or
partook
of
the
rich
delicacies
of
its
ample
larder
death
had
been
there
its
venerable
and
respected
occupant
had
just
been
borne
by
his
peers
in
rank
and
station
to
the
neighboring
graveyard
learned
affable
intrepid
a
sturdy
asserter
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
the
province
and
so
far
in
advance
of
his
time
as
to
refuse
to
yield
to
the
terrible
witchcraft
delusion
vacating
his
seat
on
the
bench
and
openly
expressing
his
disapprobation
of
the
violent
and
sanguinary
proceedings
of
the
court
wise
in
council
and
prompt
in
action
not
his
own
townsmen
alone
but
the
people
of
the
entire
province
had
reason
to
mourn
the
loss
of
nathaniel
saltonstall
four
years
before
the
events
of
which
we
are
about
to
speak
the
indian
allies
of
the
french
in
canada
suddenly
made
their
appearance
in
the
westerly
part
of
the
settlement
at
the
close
of
a
midwinter
day
six
savages
rushed
into
the
open
gate
of
a
owned
by
one
bradley
who
appears
to
have
been
absent
at
the
time
a
sentinel
stationed
in
the
house
discharged
his
musket
killing
the
foremost
indian
and
was
himself
instantly
shot
down
the
mistress
of
the
house
a
spirited
young
woman
was
making
soap
in
a
large
kettle
over
the
fire
she
seized
her
ladle
and
dashed
the
boiling
liquid
in
the
faces
of
the
assailants
scalding
one
of
them
severely
and
was
only
captured
after
such
a
resistance
as
can
scarcely
be
conceived
of
by
the
delicately
framed
and
tenderly
nurtured
occupants
of
the
places
of
our
grandmothers
after
plundering
the
house
the
indians
started
on
their
long
winter
march
for
canada
tradition
says
that
some
thirteen
persons
probably
women
and
children
were
killed
outright
at
the
garrison
goodwife
bradley
and
four
others
were
spared
as
prisoners
the
ground
was
covered
with
deep
snow
and
the
captives
were
compelled
to
carry
heavy
burdens
of
their
plundered
while
for
many
days
in
succession
they
had
no
other
sustenance
than
bits
of
hide
the
bark
of
trees
and
the
roots
of
wild
onions
and
lilies
in
this
situation
in
the
cold
wintry
forest
and
unattended
the
unhappy
young
woman
gave
birth
to
a
child
its
cries
irritated
the
savages
who
cruelly
treated
it
and
threatened
its
life
to
the
entreaties
of
the
mother
they
replied
that
they
would
spare
it
on
the
condition
that
it
should
be
baptized
after
their
fashion
she
gave
the
little
innocent
into
their
hands
when
with
mock
solemnity
they
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
its
forehead
by
gashing
it
with
their
knives
and
afterwards
barbarously
put
it
to
death
before
the
eyes
of
its
mother
seeming
to
regard
the
whole
matter
as
an
excellent
piece
of
sport
nothing
so
strongly
excited
the
risibilities
of
these
grim
barbarians
as
the
tears
and
cries
of
their
victims
extorted
by
physical
or
mental
agony
capricious
alike
in
their
cruelties
and
their
kindnesses
they
treated
some
of
their
captives
with
forbearance
and
consideration
and
tormented
others
apparently
without
cause
one
man
on
his
way
to
canada
was
killed
because
they
did
not
like
his
looks
he
was
so
sour
another
because
he
was
old
and
good
for
nothing
one
of
their
own
number
who
was
suffering
greatly
from
the
effects
of
the
scalding
soap
was
derided
and
mocked
as
a
fool
who
had
let
a
squaw
whip
him
while
on
the
other
hand
the
energy
and
spirit
manifested
by
goodwife
bradley
in
her
defence
was
a
constant
theme
of
admiration
and
gained
her
so
much
respect
among
her
captors
as
to
protect
her
from
personal
injury
or
insult
on
her
arrival
in
canada
she
was
sold
to
a
french
farmer
by
whom
she
was
kindly
treated
in
the
mean
time
her
husband
made
every
exertion
in
his
power
to
ascertain
her
fate
and
early
in
the
next
year
learned
that
she
was
a
slave
in
canada
he
immediately
set
off
through
the
wilderness
on
foot
accompanied
only
by
his
dog
who
drew
a
small
sled
upon
which
he
carried
some
provisions
for
his
sustenance
and
a
bag
of
snuff
which
the
governor
of
the
province
gave
him
as
a
present
to
the
governor
of
canada
after
encountering
almost
incredible
hardships
and
dangers
with
a
perseverance
which
shows
how
well
he
appreciated
the
good
qualities
of
his
stolen
helpmate
he
reached
montreal
and
betook
himself
to
the
governor
residence
ragged
and
wasted
with
cold
and
hunger
he
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
vaudreuil
the
courtly
frenchman
civilly
received
the
gift
of
the
bag
of
snuff
listened
to
the
poor
fellow
story
and
put
him
in
a
way
to
redeem
his
wife
without
difficulty
the
joy
of
the
latter
on
seeing
her
husband
in
the
strange
land
of
her
captivity
may
well
be
imagined
they
returned
by
water
landing
at
boston
early
in
the
summer
there
is
a
tradition
that
this
was
not
the
goodwife
first
experience
of
indian
captivity
the
late
abiel
abbott
in
his
manuscript
of
judith
whiting
of
the
indian
states
that
she
had
previously
been
a
prisoner
probably
before
her
marriage
after
her
return
she
lived
quietly
at
the
until
the
summer
of
the
next
year
one
bright
a
party
of
indians
were
seen
silently
and
cautiously
approaching
the
only
occupants
of
the
garrison
at
that
time
were
bradley
his
wife
and
children
and
a
servant
the
three
adults
armed
themselves
with
muskets
and
prepared
to
defend
themselves
goodwife
bradley
supposing
the
indians
had
come
with
the
intention
of
again
capturing
her
encouraged
her
husband
to
fight
to
the
last
declaring
that
she
had
rather
die
on
her
own
hearth
than
fall
into
their
hands
the
indians
rushed
upon
the
garrison
and
assailed
the
thick
oaken
door
which
they
forced
partly
open
when
a
shot
from
goodwife
bradley
laid
the
foremost
dead
on
the
threshold
the
loss
of
their
leader
so
disheartened
them
that
they
made
a
hasty
retreat
the
year
passed
away
without
any
attack
upon
the
exposed
frontier
settlement
a
feeling
of
comparative
security
succeeded
to
the
almost
sleepless
anxiety
and
terror
of
the
inhabitants
and
they
were
beginning
to
congratulate
each
other
upon
the
termination
of
their
long
and
bitter
trials
but
the
end
was
not
yet
early
in
the
spring
of
the
principal
tribes
of
indians
in
alliance
with
the
french
held
a
great
council
and
agreed
to
furnish
three
hundred
warriors
for
an
expedition
to
the
english
frontier
they
were
joined
by
one
hundred
french
canadians
and
several
volunteers
consisting
of
officers
of
the
french
army
and
younger
sons
of
the
nobility
adventurous
and
unscrupulous
the
sieur
de
chaillons
and
hertel
de
rouville
distinguished
as
a
partisan
in
former
expeditions
cruel
and
unsparing
as
his
indian
allies
commanded
the
french
troops
the
indians
marshalled
under
their
several
chiefs
obeyed
the
general
orders
of
la
perriere
a
catholic
priest
accompanied
them
de
ronville
with
the
french
troops
and
a
portion
of
the
indians
took
the
route
by
the
river
francois
about
the
middle
of
summer
la
perriere
with
the
french
mohawks
crossed
lake
champlain
the
place
of
rendezvous
was
lake
nickisipigue
on
the
way
a
huron
accidentally
killed
one
of
his
companions
whereupon
the
tribe
insisted
on
halting
and
holding
a
council
it
was
gravely
decided
that
this
accident
was
an
evil
omen
and
that
the
expedition
would
prove
disastrous
and
in
spite
of
the
endeavors
of
the
french
officers
the
whole
band
deserted
next
the
mohawks
became
dissatisfied
and
refused
to
proceed
to
the
entreaties
and
promises
of
their
french
allies
they
replied
that
an
infectious
disease
had
broken
out
among
them
and
that
if
they
remained
it
would
spread
through
the
whole
army
the
french
partisans
were
not
deceived
by
a
falsehood
so
transparent
but
they
were
in
no
condition
to
enforce
obedience
and
with
bitter
execrations
and
reproaches
they
saw
the
mohawks
turn
back
on
their
warpath
the
diminished
army
pressed
on
to
nickisipigue
in
the
expectation
of
meeting
agreeably
to
their
promise
the
norridgewock
and
penobscot
indians
they
found
the
place
deserted
and
after
waiting
for
some
days
were
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
eastern
tribes
had
broken
their
pledge
of
cooperation
under
these
circumstances
a
council
was
held
and
the
original
design
of
the
expedition
namely
the
destruction
of
the
whole
line
of
frontier
towns
beginning
with
portsmouth
was
abandoned
they
had
still
a
sufficient
force
for
the
surprise
of
a
single
settlement
and
haverhill
on
the
merrimac
was
selected
for
conquest
in
the
mean
time
intelligence
of
the
expedition
greatly
exaggerated
in

of

and

forty
men
under
the

of
major
turner
and
captains
price
and
gardner
were
stationed
at
haverhill
in
the
different
at
first
a
good
degree
of
vigilance
was
manifested
but
as
days
and
weeks
passed
without
any
alarm
the
inhabitants
relapsed
into
their
old
habits
and
some
even
began
to
believe
that
the
rumored
descent
of
the
indians
was
only
a
pretext
for
quartering
upon
them
of
lazy
rollicking
soldiers
who
certainly
seemed
more
expert
in
making
love
to
their
daughters
and
drinking
their
best
ale
and
cider
than
in
patrolling
the
woods
or
putting
the
garrisons
into
a
defensible
state
the
grain
and
hay
harvest
ended
without
disturbance
the
men
worked
in
their
fields
and
the
women
pursued
their
household
avocations
without
any
very
serious
apprehension
of
danger
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
was
an
eccentric
fellow
named
keezar
who
led
a
wandering
unsettled
life
oscillating
like
a
crazy
pendulum
between
haverhill
and
amesbury
he
had
a
smattering
of
a
variety
of
trades
was
a
famous
wrestler
and
for
a
mug
of
ale
would
leap
over
an
with
the
unspilled
beverage
in
his
hand
on
one
occasion
when
at
supper
his
wife
complained
that
she
had
no
tin
dishes
and
as
there
were
none
to
be
obtained
nearer
than
boston
he
started
on
foot
in
the
evening
travelled
through
the
woods
to
the
city
and
returned
with
his
ware
by
sunrise
the
next
morning
passing
over
a
distance
of
between
sixty
and
seventy
miles
the
tradition
of
his
strange
habits
feats
of
strength
and
wicked
practical
jokes
is
still
common
in
his
native
town
on
the
morning
of
the
of
the
eighth
month
he
was
engaged
in
taking
home
his
horse
which
according
to
his
custom
he
had
turned
into
his
neighbor
rich
clover
field
the
evening
previous
by
the
gray
light
of
dawn
he
saw
a
long
file
of
men
marching
silently
towards
the
town
he
hurried
back
to
the
village
and
gave
the
alarm
by
firing
a
gun
previous
to
this
however
a
young
man
belonging
to
a
neighboring
town
who
had
been
spending
the
night
with
a
young
woman
of
the
village
had
met
the
advance
of
the
and
turning
back
in
extreme
terror
and
confusion
thought
only
of
the
safety
of
his
betrothed
and
passed
silently
through
a
considerable
part
of
the
village
to
her
dwelling
after
he
had
effectually
concealed
her
he
ran
out
to
give
the
alarm
but
it
was
too
late
keezar
gun
was
answered
by
the
terrific
yells
whistling
and
whooping
of
the
indians
house
after
house
was
assailed
and
captured
men
women
and
children
were
massacred
the
minister
of
the
town
was
killed
by
a
shot
through
his
door
two
of
his
children
were
saved
by
the
courage
and
sagacity
of
his
negro
slave
hagar
she
carried
them
into
the
cellar
and
covered
them
with
tubs
and
then
crouched
behind
a
barrel
of
meat
just
in
time
to
escape
the
vigilant
eyes
of
the
enemy
who
entered
the
cellar
and
plundered
it
she
saw
them
pass
and
repass
the
tubs
under
which
the
children
lay
and
take
meat
from
the
very
barrel
which
concealed
herself
three
soldiers
were
quartered
in
the
house
but
they
made
no
defence
and
were
killed
while
begging
for
quarter
the
wife
of
thomas
hartshorne
after
her
husband
and
three
sons
had
fallen
took
her
younger
children
into
the
cellar
leaving
an
infant
on
a
bed
in
the
garret
fearful
that
its
cries
would
betray
her
place
of
concealment
if
she
took
it
with
her
the
indians
entered
the
garret
and
tossed
the
child
out
of
the
window
upon
a
pile
of
clapboards
where
it
was
afterwards
found
stunned
and
insensible
it
recovered
nevertheless
and
became
a
man
of
remarkable
strength
and
stature
and
it
used
to
be
a
standing
joke
with
his
friends
that
he
had
been
stinted
by
the
indians
when
they
threw
him
out
of
the
window

major
turner
with
a
portion
of
his
soldiers
entered
the
village
and
the
enemy
made
a
rapid
retreat
carrying
with
them
seventeen
prisoners
they
were
pursued
and
overtaken
just
as
they
were
entering
the
woods
and
a
severe
skirmish
took
place
in
which
the
rescue
of
some
of
the
prisoners
was
effected
thirty
of
the

were
left
dead
on

part
of
the

captains

and

johnson
with
thirteen

terribly
from

on

shaved
one
side
of
his

and
greased
the

painted
his
face
at
a
fort
nine
miles
from

a
council
was
held
in

to
decide
his
fate
and
he
had
the
unenviable
privilege
of
listening
to
a
protracted
discussion
upon
the
expediency
of
burning
him
the
fire
was
already
kindled
and
the
poor
fellow
was
preparing
to
meet
his
doom
with
firmness
when
it
was
announced
to
him
that
his
life
was
spared
this
result
of

no

assailed
him
with
a
knife
and
cut
off
one
of
his
fingers
another

him
with

indians
spent
the
night
in
dancing
and
singing
compelling
their
prisoner
to
go
round
the
ring
with
them
in
the
morning
one
of
their
orators
made
a
long
speech
to

him

the

rushing
as
with

accord

in

spread
from

to

that
the
british
regulars
had
landed
on

been
just

terrible
stories
of
the
atrocities

been
related
and
it
was
believed
that
nothing
short
of
a
general
extermination
of
the
patriots
men
women

was
contemplated
by
the
british
almost
simultaneously

and
nurse
her
child
when
she
found
to
her
great
horror
that
she
had
brought
off
the
cat
instead
of
the
baby
all
through
that
memorable
night
the
terror
swept
onward
towards
the
north
with
a
speed
which
seems
almost
miraculous
producing
everywhere
the
same
results
at
midnight
a
horseman
clad
only
in
shirt
and
breeches
dashed
by
our
grandfather
door
in
haverhill
twenty
miles
up
the
river
turn
out
get
a
musket
turn
out
he
shouted
the
regulars
are
landing
on
plum
island
i
glad
of
it
responded
the
old
gentleman
from
his
chamber
window
i
wish
they
were
all
there
and
obliged
to
stay
there
when
it
is
understood
that
plum
island
is
little
more
than
a
naked
the
benevolence
of
this
wish
can
be
readily
appreciated
all
the
boats
on
the
river
were
constantly
employed
for
several
hours
in
conveying
across
the
terrified
fugitives
through
the
dead
waste
and
middle
of
the
night
they
fled
over
the
border
into
new
hampshire
some
feared
to
take
the
frequented
roads
and
wandered
over
wooded
hills
and
through
swamps
where
the
snows
of
the
late
winter
had
scarcely
melted
they
heard
the
tramp
and
outcry
of
those
behind
them
and
fancied
that
the
sounds
were
made
by
pursuing
enemies
fast
as
they
fled
the
terror
by
some
unaccountable
means
outstripped
them
they
found
houses
deserted
and
streets
strewn
with
household
stuffs
abandoned
in
the
hurry
of
escape
towards
morning
however
the
tide
partially
turned
grown
men
began
to
feel
ashamed
of
their
fears
the
old
hardihood
paused
and
looked
the
terror
in
its
face
single
or
in
small
parties
armed
with
such
weapons
as
they
found
at
hand
among
which
long
poles
sharpened
and
charred
at
the
end
were
conspicuous
they
began
to
retrace
their
steps
in
the
mean
time
such
of
the
good
people
of
ipswich
as
were
unable
or
unwilling
to
leave
their
homes
became
convinced
that
the
terrible
rumor
which
had
nearly
depopulated
their
settlement
was
unfounded
among
those
who
had
there
awaited
the
onslaught
of
the
regulars
was
a
young
man
from
exeter
new
hampshire
becoming
satisfied
that
the
whole
matter
was
a
delusion
he
mounted
his
horse
and
followed
after
the
retreating
multitude
undeceiving
all
whom
he
overtook
late
at
night
he
reached
newburyport
greatly
to
the
relief
of
its
sleepless
inhabitants
and
hurried
across
the
river
proclaiming
as
he
rode
the
welcome
tidings
the
sun
rose
upon
haggard
and
jaded
fugitives
worn
with
excitement
and
fatigue
slowly
returning
homeward
their
satisfaction
at
the
absence
of
danger
somewhat
moderated
by
an
unpleasant
consciousness
of
the
ludicrous
scenes
of
their
premature
night
flitting
any
inference
which
might
be
drawn
from
the
foregoing
narrative
derogatory
to
the
character
of
the
people
of
new
england
at
that
day
on
the
score
of
courage
would
be
essentially
erroneous
it
is
true
they
were
not
the
men
to
court
danger
or
rashly
throw
away
their
lives
for
the
mere
glory
of
the
sacrifice
they
had
always
a
prudent
and
wholesome
regard
to
their
own
comfort
and
safety
they
justly
looked
upon
sound
heads
and
limbs
as
better
than
broken
ones
life
was
to
them
too
serious
and
important
and
their
property
too
valuable
to
be
lightly
hazarded
they
never
attempted
to
cheat
themselves
by
the
difficulty
to
be
encountered
or
shutting
their
eyes
to
its
probable
consequences
cautious
wary
schooled
in
the
subtle
strategy
of
indian
warfare
where
is
by
no
means
a
secondary
object
they
had
little
in
common
with
the
reckless
enthusiasm
of
their
french
allies
or
the
stolid
indifference
of
the
fighting
machines
of
the
british
regular
army
when
danger
could
no
longer
be
avoided
they
met
it
with
firmness
and
iron
endurance
but
with
a
very
vivid
appreciation
of
its
magnitude
indeed
it
must
be
admitted
by
all
who
are
familiar
with
the
history
of
our
fathers
that
the
element
of
fear
held
an
important
place
among
their
characteristics
it
exaggerated
all
the
dangers
of
their
earthly
pilgrimage
and
peopled
the
future
with
shapes
of
evil
their
fear
of
satan
invested
him
with
some
of
the
attributes
of
omnipotence
and
almost
reached
the
point
of
reverence
the
slightest
shock
of
an
earthquake
filled
all
hearts
with
terror
stout
men
trembled
by
their
hearths
with
dread
of
some
paralytic
old
woman
supposed
to
be
a
witch
and
when
they
believed
themselves
called
upon
to
grapple
with
these
terrors
and
endure
the
afflictions
of
their
allotment
they
brought
to
the
trial
a
capability
of
suffering
undiminished
by
the
chloroform
of
modern
philosophy
they
were
heroic
in
endurance
panics
like
the
one
we
have
described
might
bow
and
sway
them
like
reeds
in
the
wind
but
they
stood
up
like
the
oaks
of
their
own
forests
beneath
the
thunder
and
the
hail
of
actual
calamity
it
was
certainly
lucky
for
the
good
people
of
essex
county
that
no
wicked
wag
of
a
tory
undertook
to
immortalize
in
rhyme
their
ridiculous
hegira
as
judge
hopkinson
did
the
famous
battle
of
the
kegs
in
philadelphia
like
the
more
recent
madawaska
war
in
maine
the
great
chepatchet
demonstration
in
rhode
island
and
the
sauk
fuss
of
wisconsin
it
remains
to
this
day
unsyllabled
unsung
and
the
memory
of
age
alone
preserves
the
unwritten
history
of
the
great
ipswich
fright
pope
night
lay
up
the
fagots
neat
and
trim
pile
up
higher
set
afire
the
pope
roasts
us
and
we
roast
him
old
song
the
recent
attempt
of
the
romish
church
to
reestablish
its
hierarchy
in
great
britain
with
the
new
cardinal
wiseman
at
its
head
seems
to
have
revived
an
old
popular
custom
a
grim
piece
of
protestant
sport
which
since
the
days
of
lord
george
gordon
and
the
no
popery
mob
had
very
generally
fallen
into
disuse
on
the
of
the
eleventh
month
of
this
present
year
all
england
was
traversed
by
processions
and
lighted
up
with
bonfires
in
commemoration
of
the
detection
of
the
gunpowder
plot
of
guy
fawkes
and
the
papists
in
popes
bishops
and
cardinals
in
straw
and
pasteboard
were
paraded
through
the
streets
and
burned
amid
the
shouts
of
the
populace
a
great
portion
of
whom
would
have
doubtless
been
quite
as
ready
to
do
the
same
pleasant
little
office
for
the
bishop
of
exeter
or
his
grace
of
canterbury
if
they
could
have
carted
about
and
burned
in
effigy
a
protestant
hierarchy
as
safely
as
a
catholic
one
in
this
country
where
every
sect
takes
its
own
way
undisturbed
by
legal
restrictions
each
ecclesiastical
tub
balancing
itself
as
it
best
may
on
its
own
bottom
and
where
bishops
catholic
and
bishops
episcopal
bishops
methodist
and
bishops
mormon
jostle
each
other
in
our
thoroughfares
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
we
should
trouble
ourselves
with
the
matter
at
issue
between
the
rival
hierarchies
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
it
is
a
very
pretty
quarrel
however
and
good
must
come
out
of
it
as
it
can
not
fail
to
attract
popular
attention
to
the
shallowness
of
the
spiritual
pretensions
of
both
parties
and
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
a
hierarchy
of
any
sort
has
very
little
in
common
with
the
fishermen
and
of
the
new
testament
pope
night
the
anniversary
of
the
discovery
of
the
papal
incendiary
guy
fawkes
booted
and
spurred
ready
to
touch
fire
to
his
under
the
parliament
house
was
celebrated
by
the
early
settlers
of
new
england
and
doubtless
afforded
a
good
deal
of
relief
to
the
younger
plants
of
grace
in
the
puritan
vineyard
in
those
solemn
old
days
the
recurrence
of
the
anniversary
with
its
processions
hideous
images
of
the
pope
and
guy
fawkes
its
liberal
potations
of
strong
waters
and
its
blazing
bonfires
reddening
the
wild
november
hills
must
have
been
looked
forward
to
with
no
slight
degree
of
pleasure
for
one
night
at
least
the
cramped
and
smothered
fun
and
mischief
of
the
younger
generation
were
permitted
to
revel
in
the
wild
extravagance
of
a
roman
saturnalia
or
the
christmas
holidays
of
a
slave
plantation
bigotry
frowning
upon
the
with
its
flower
wreaths
and
sportive
revellers
and
counting
the
steps
of
the
dancers
as
so
many
steps
towards
perdition
recognized
in
the
grim
farce
of
guy
fawkes
anniversary
something
of
its
own
lineaments
smiled
complacently
upon
the
riotous
young
actors
and
opened
its
close
purse
to
furnish
to
roast
the
pope
and
strong
water
to
moisten
the
throats
of
his
noisy
judges
and
executioners
up
to
the
time
of
the
revolution
the
powder
plot
was
duly
commemorated
throughout
new
england
at
that
period
the
celebration
of
it
was
discountenanced
and
in
many
places
prohibited
on
the
ground
that
it
was
insulting
to
our
catholic
allies
from
france
in
coffin
history
of
newbury
it
is
stated
that
in
the
town
authorities
of
newburyport
ordered
that
no
effigies
be
carried
about
or
exhibited
only
in
the
daytime
the
last
public
celebration
in
that
town
was
in
the
following
year
long
before
the
close
of
the
last
century
the
exhibitions
of
pope
night
had
entirely
ceased
throughout
the
country
with
as
far
as
we
can
learn
a
solitary
exception
the
stranger
who
chances
to
be
travelling
on
the
road
between
newburyport
and
haverhill
on
the
night
of
the
of
november
may
well
fancy
that
an
invasion
is
threatened
from
the
sea
or
that
an
insurrection
is
going
on
inland
for
from
all
the
high
hills
overlooking
the
river
tall
fires
are
seen
blazing
redly
against
the
cold
dark
autumnal
sky
surrounded
by
groups
of
young
men
and
boys
busily
engaged
in
urging
them
with
fresh
fuel
into
intenser
activity
to
feed
these
bonfires
everything
combustible
which
could
be
begged
or
stolen
from
the
neighboring
villages
and
fences
is
put
in
requisition
old
purloined
from
the

from

stored
away
for

and
perhaps
weeks
in
the

or
in

of

in
preparation
for
pope
night
from
the
earliest
settlement
of
the
towns
of
amesbury
and
salisbury
the
night
of
the
powder
plot
has
been
thus
celebrated
with
unbroken
regularity
down
to
the
present
time
the
event
which
it
once
commemorated
is
probably
now
unknown
to
most
of
the
juvenile
actors
the
symbol
lives
on
from
generation
to
generation
after
the
significance
is
lost
and
we
have
seen
the
children
of
our
catholic
neighbors
as
busy
as
their
protestant
playmates
in
collecting
by
hook
or
by
crook
the
materials
for
night
bonfires
we
remember
on
one
occasion
walking
out
with
a
gifted
and
learned
catholic
friend
to
witness
the
fine
effect
of
the
illumination
on
the
hills
and
his
hearty
appreciation
of
its
picturesque
and
wild
beauty
the
busy
groups
in
the
strong
relief
of
the
fires
and
the
play
and
corruscation
of
the
changeful
lights
on
the
bare
brown
hills
naked
trees
and
autumn
clouds
in
addition
to
the
bonfires
on
the
hills
there
was
formerly
a
procession
in
the
streets
bearing
grotesque
images
of
the
pope
his
cardinals
and
friars
and
behind
them
satan
himself
a
monster
with
huge
on
his
head
and
a
long
tail
brandishing
his
pitchfork
and
goading
them
onward
the
pope
was
generally
furnished
with
a
movable
head
which
could
be
turned
round
thrown
back
or
made
to
bow
like
that
of
a
ware
mandarin
an
aged
inhabitant
of
the
neighborhood
has
furnished
us
with
some
fragments
of
the
songs
sung
on
such
occasions
probably
the
same
which
our
british
ancestors
trolled
forth
around
their
bonfires
two
centuries
ago
the
fifth
of
november
as
you
well
remember
was
gunpowder
treason
and
plot
and
where
is
the
reason
that
gunpowder
treason
should
ever
be
forgot
when
james
the
first
the
sceptre
swayed
this
hellish
powder
plot
was
laid
they
placed
the
powder
down
below
all
for
old
england
overthrow
lucky
the
man
and
happy
the
day
that
caught
guy
fawkes
in
the
middle
of
his
play
hark
our
bell
goes
jink
jink
jink
pray
madam
pray
sir
give
us
something
to
drink
pray
madam
pray
sir
if
you
something
give
we
burn
the
dog
and
not
let
him
live
we
burn
the
dog
without
his
head
and
then
you
say
the
dog
is
dead
look
here
from
rome
the
pope
has
come
that
fiery
serpent
dire
here
the
pope
that
we
have
got
the
old
promoter
of
the
plot
we
stick
a
pitchfork
in
his
back
and
throw
him
in
the
fire
there
is
a
slight
savor
of
a
smithfield
roasting
about
these
lines
such
as
regaled
the
senses
of
the
virgin
queen
or
bloody
mary
which
entirely
reconciles
us
to
their
disuse
at
the
present
time
it
should
be
the
fervent
prayer
of
all
good
men
that
the
evil
spirit
of
religious
hatred
and
intolerance
which
on
the
one
hand
prompted
the
gunpowder
plot
and
which
on
the
other
has
ever
since
made
it
the
occasion
of
reproach
and
persecution
of
an
entire
sect
of
professing
christians
may
be
no
longer
perpetuated
in
the
matter
of
exclusiveness
and
intolerance
none
of
the
older
sects
can
safely
reproach
each
other
and
it
becomes
all
to
hope
and
labor
for
the
coming
of
that
day
when
the
hymns
of
cowper
and
the
confessions
of
augustine
the
humane
philosophy
of
channing
and
the
devout
meditations
of
thomas
a
kempis
the
simple
essays
of
woolman
and
the
glowing
periods
of
bossuet
shall
be
regarded
as
the
offspring
of
one
spirit
and
one
faith

an
incident
of
the
indian
war
of
the
township
of
haverhill
even
as
late
as
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
a
frontier
settlement
occupying
an
advanced
position
in
the
great
wilderness
which
unbroken
by
the
clearing
of
a
white
man
extended
from
the
merrimac
river
to
the
french
villages
on
the
francois
a
tract
of
twelve
miles
on
the
river
and
three
or
four
northwardly
was
occupied
by
scattered
settlers
while
in
the
centre
of
the
town
a
compact
village
had
grown
up
in
the
immediate
vicinity
there
were
but
few
indians
and
these
generally
peaceful
and
inoffensive
on
the
breaking
out
of
the
narragansett
war
the
inhabitants
had
erected
fortifications
and
taken
other
measures
for
defence
but
with
the
possible
exception
of
one
man
who
was
found
slain
in
the
woods
in
none
of
the
inhabitants
were
molested
and
it
was
not
until
about
the
year
that
the
safety
of
the
settlement
was
seriously
threatened
three
persons
were
killed
in
that
year
in
six
garrisons
were
established
in
different
parts
of
the
town
with
a
small
company
of
soldiers
attached
to
each
two
of
these
houses
are
still
standing
they
were
built
of
brick
two
stories
high
with
a
single
outside
door
so
small
and
narrow
that
but
one
person
could
enter
at
a
time
the
windows
few
and
only
about
two
and
a
half
feet
long
by
eighteen
inches
with
thick
diamond
glass
secured
with
lead
and
crossed
inside
with
bars
of
iron
the
basement
had
but
two
rooms
and
the
chamber
was
entered
by
a
ladder
instead
of
stairs
so
that
the
inmates
if
driven
thither
could
cut
off
communication
with
the
rooms
below
many
private
houses
were
strengthened
and
fortified
we
remember
one
familiar
to
our
boyhood
a
venerable
old
building
of
wood
with
brick
between
the
weather
boards
and
ceiling
with
a
massive
balustrade
over
the
door
constructed
of
oak
timber
and
plank
with
holes
through
the
latter
for
firing
upon
assailants
the
door
opened
upon
a
hall
or
entry
leading
into
the
huge
single
room
of
the
basement
which
was
lighted
by
two
small
windows
the
ceiling
black
with
the
smoke
of
a
century
and
a
half
a
huge
fireplace
calculated
for
wood
occupying
one
entire
side
while
overhead
suspended
from
the
timbers
or
on
shelves
fastened
to
them
were
household
stores
farming
utensils
guns
bunches
of
herbs
gathered
perhaps
a
century
ago
strings
of
dried
apples
and
pumpkins
links
of
mottled
sausages
spareribs
and
flitches
of
bacon
the
firelight
of
an
evening
dimly
revealing

tradition
has
preserved
many
incidents
of
life
in
the
garrisons
in
times
of
unusual
peril
the
settlers
generally
resorted
at
night
to
the
fortified
houses
taking
thither
their
flocks
and
herds
and
such
household
valuables
as
were
most
likely
to
strike
the
fancy
or
minister
to
the
comfort
or
vanity
of
the
heathen
marauders
false
alarms
were
frequent
the
smoke
of
a
distant
fire
the
bark
of
a
dog
in
the
deep
woods
a
stump
or
bush
taking
in
the
uncertain
light
of
stars
and
moon
the
appearance
of
a
man
were
sufficient
to
spread
alarm
through
the
entire
settlement
and
to
cause
the
armed
men
of
the
garrison
to
pass
whole
nights
in
sleepless
watching
it
is
said
that
at
the
sentinel
on
duty
saw
as
he
thought
an
indian
inside
of
the
paling
which
surrounded
the
building
and
apparently
seeking
to
gain
an
entrance
he
promptly
raised
his
musket
and
fired
at
the
intruder
alarming
thereby
the
entire
garrison
the
women
and
children
left
their
beds
and
the
men
seized
their
guns
and
commenced
firing
on
the
suspicious
object
but
it
seemed
to
bear
a
charmed
life
and
remained
unharmed
as
the
morning
dawned
however
the
mystery
was
solved
by
the
discovery
of
a
black
quilted
petticoat
hanging
on
the
completely
riddled
with
balls
as
a
matter
of
course
under
circumstances
of
perpetual
alarm
and
frequent
peril
the
duty
of
cultivating
their
fields
and
gathering
their
harvests
and
working
at
their
mechanical
avocations
was
dangerous
and
difficult
to
the
settlers
one
instance
will
serve
as
an
illustration
at
the
of
thomas
dustin
the
husband
of
the
mary
dustin
who
while
a
captive
of
the
indians
and
maddened
by
the
murder
of
her
infant
child
killed
and
scalped
with
the
assistance
of
a
young
boy
the
entire
band
of
her
captors
ten
in
number
the
business
of
was
carried
on
the
pits
where
the
clay
was
found
were
only
a
few
rods
from
the
house
yet
no
man
ventured
to
bring
the
clay
to
the
yard
within
the
enclosure
without
the
attendance
of
a
file
of
soldiers
an
anecdote
relating
to
this
garrison
has
been
handed
down
to
the
present
tune
among
its
inmates
were
two
young
cousins
joseph
and
mary
whittaker
the
latter
a
merry
handsome
girl
relieving
the
tedium
of
garrison
duty
with
her
mirthfulness
and
making
a
sunshine
in
that
shady
place
joseph
in
the
intervals
of
his
labors
in
the
double
capacity
of
maker
and
was
assiduous
in
his
attentions
to
his
fair
cousin
who
was
not
inclined
to
encourage
him
growing
desperate
he
threatened
one
evening
to
throw
himself
into
the
garrison
well
his
threat
only
called
forth
the
laughter
of
his
mistress
and
bidding
her
farewell
he
proceeded
to
put
it
in
execution
on
reaching
the
well
he
stumbled
over
a
log
whereupon
animated
by
a
happy
idea
he
dropped
the
wood
into
the
water
instead
of
himself
and
hiding
behind
the
curb
awaited
the
result
mary
who
had
been
listening
at
the
door
and
who
had
not
believed
her
lover
capable
of
so
rash
an
act
heard
the
sudden
plunge
of
the
wooden
joseph
she
ran
to
the
well
and
leaning
over
the
curb
and
peering
down
the
dark
opening
cried
out
in
tones
of
anguish
and
remorse
o
joseph
if
you
in
the
land
of
the
living
i
have
you
i
take
ye
at
your
word
answered
joseph
springing
up
from
his
and
avenging
himself
for
her
coyness
and
coldness
by
a
hearty
embrace
our
own
paternal
ancestor
owing
to
religious
scruples
in
the
matter
of
taking
arms
even
for
defence
of
life
and
property
refused
to
leave
his
undefended
house
and
enter
the
garrison
the
indians
frequently
came
to
his
house
and
the
family
more
than
once
in
the
night
heard
them
whispering
under
the
windows
and
saw
them
put
their
copper
faces
to
the
glass
to
take
a
view
of
the
apartments
strange
as
it
may
seen
they
never
offered
any
injury
or
insult
to
the
inmates
in
the
township
was
many
times
molested
by
indians
and
several
persons
were
killed
and
wounded
early
in
the
fall
a
small
party
made
their
appearance
in
the
northerly
part
of
the
town
where
finding
two
boys
at
work
in
an
open
field
they
managed
to
surprise
and
capture
them
and
without
committing
further
violence
retreated
through
the
woods
to
their
homes
on
the
shore
of
lake
winnipesaukee
isaac
bradley
aged
fifteen
was
a
small
but
active
and
vigorous
boy
his
companion
in
captivity
joseph
whittaker
was
only
eleven
yet
quite
as
large
in
size
and
heavier
in
his
movements
after
a
hard
and
painful
journey
they
arrived
at
the
lake
and
were
placed
in
an
indian
family
consisting
of
a
man
and
squaw
and
two
or
three
children
here
they
soon
acquired
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
indian
tongue
to
enable
them
to
learn
from
the
conversation
carried
on
in
their
presence
that
it
was
designed
to
take
them
to
canada
in
the
spring
this
discovery
was
a
painful
one
canada
the
land
of
papist
priests
and
bloody
indians
was
the
especial
terror
of
the
new
england
settlers
and
the
anathema
maranatha
of
puritan
pulpits
thither
the
indians
usually
hurried
their
captives
where
they
compelled
them
to
work
in
their
villages
or
sold
them
to
the
french
planters
escape
from
thence
through
a
deep
wilderness
and
across
lakes
and
mountains
and
almost
impassable
rivers
without
food
or
guide
was
regarded
as
an
impossibility
the
poor
boys
terrified
by
the
prospect
of
being
carried
still
farther
from
their
home
and
friends
began
to
dream
of
escaping
from
their
masters
before
they
started
for
canada
it
was
now
winter
it
would
have
been
little
short
of
madness
to
have
chosen
for
flight
that
season
of
bitter
cold
and
deep
snows
owing
to
exposure
and
want
of
proper
food
and
clothing
isaac
the
eldest
of
the
boys
was
seized
with
a
violent
fever
from
which
he
slowly
recovered
in
the
course
of
the
winter
his
indian
mistress
was
as
kind
to
him
as
her
circumstances
permitted
procuring
medicinal
herbs
and
roots
for
her
patient
and
tenderly
watching
over
him
in
the
long
winter
nights
spring
came
at
length
the
snows
melted
and
the
ice
was
broken
up
on
the
lake
the
indians
began
to
make
preparations
for
journeying
to
canada
and
isaac
who
had
during
his
sickness
devised
a
plan
of
escape
saw
that
the
time
of
putting
it
in
execution
had
come
on
the
evening
before
he
was
to
make
the
attempt
he
for
the
first
time
informed
his
younger
companion
of
his
design
and
told
him
if
he
intended
to
accompany
him
he
must
be
awake
at
the
time
appointed
the
boys
lay
down
as
usual
in
the
wigwam
in
the
midst
of
the
family
joseph
soon
fell
asleep
but
isaac
fully
sensible
of
the
danger
and
difficulty
of
the
enterprise
before
him
lay
awake
watchful
for
his
opportunity
about
midnight
he
rose
cautiously
stepping
over
the
sleeping
forms
of
the
family
and
securing
as
he
went
his
indian
master
flint
steel
and
tinder
and
a
small
quantity
of
dry
and
cornbread
he
then
carefully
awakened
his
companion
who
starting
up
forgetful
of
the
cause
of
his
disturbance
asked
aloud
what
do
you
want
the
savages
began
to
stir
and
isaac
trembling
with
fear
of
detection
lay
down
again
and
pretended
to
be
asleep
after
waiting
a
while
he
again
rose
satisfied
from
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
indians
that
they
were
all
sleeping
and
fearing
to
awaken
joseph
a
second
time
lest
he
should
again
hazard
all
by
his
thoughtlessness
he
crept
softly
out
of
the
wigwam
he
had
proceeded
but
a
few
rods
when
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
and
supposing
himself
pursued
he
hurried
into
the
woods
casting
a
glance
backward
what
was
his
joy
to
see
his
young
companion
running
after
him
they
hastened
on
in
a
southerly
direction
as
nearly
as
they
could
determine
hoping
to
reach
their
distant
home
when
daylight
appeared
they
found
a
large
hollow
log
into
which
they
crept
for
concealment
wisely
judging
that
they
would
be
hotly
pursued
by
their
indian
captors
their
sagacity
was
by
no
means
at
fault
the
indians
missing
their
prisoners
in
the
morning
started
off
in
pursuit
with
their
dogs
as
the
young
boys
lay
in
the
log
they
could
hear
the
whistle
of
the
indians
and
the
barking
of
dogs
upon
their
track
it
was
a
trying
moment
and
even
the
stout
heart
of
the
elder
boy
sank
within
him
as
the
dogs
came
up
to
the
log
and
set
up
a
loud
bark
of
discovery
but
his
presence
of
mind
saved
him
he
spoke
in
a
low
tone
to
the
dogs
who
recognizing
his
familiar
voice
wagged
their
tails
with
delight
and
ceased
barking
he
then
threw
to
them
the
morsel
of
he
had
taken
from
the
wigwam
while
the
dogs
were
thus
diverted
the
indians
made
their
appearance
the
boys
heard
the
light
stealthy
sound
of
their
moccasins
on
the
leaves
they
passed
close
to
the
log
and
the
dogs
having
devoured
their
meat
trotted
after
their
masters
through
a
crevice
in
the
log
the
boys
looked
after
them
and
saw
them
disappear
in
the
thick
woods
they
remained
in
their
covert
until
night
when
they
started
again
on
their
long
journey
taking
a
new
route
to
avoid
the
indians
at
daybreak
they
again
concealed
themselves
but
travelled
the
next
night
and
day
without
resting
by
this
time
they
had
consumed
all
the
bread
which
they
had
taken
and
were
fainting
from
hunger
and
weariness
just
at
the
close
of
the
third
day
they
were
providentially
enabled
to
kill
a
pigeon
and
a
small
tortoise
a
part
of
which
they
ate
raw
not
daring
to
make
a
fire
which
might
attract
the
watchful
eyes
of
savages
on
the
sixth
day
they
struck
upon
an
old
indian
path
and
following
it
until
night
came
suddenly
upon
a
camp
of
the
enemy
deep
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
under
the
shelter
of
a
ridge
of
land
heavily
timbered
a
great
fire
of
logs
and
brushwood
was
burning
and
around
it
the
indians
sat
eating
their
and
smoking
their
pipes
the
poor
fugitives
starving
weary
and
chilled
by
the
cold
spring
blasts
gazed
down
upon
the
ample
fire
and
the
savory
meats
which
the
squaws
were
cooking
by
it
but
felt
no
temptation
to
purchase
warmth
and
food
by
surrendering
themselves
to
captivity
death
in
the
forest
seemed
preferable
they
turned
and
fled
back
upon
their
track
expecting
every
moment
to
hear
the
yells
of
pursuers
the
morning
found
them
seated
on
the
bank
of
a
small
stream
their
feet
torn
and
bleeding
and
their
bodies
emaciated
the
elder
as
a
last
effort
made
search
for
roots
and
fortunately
discovered
a
few
glicine
apios
which
served
to
refresh
in
some
degree
himself
and
his
still
weaker
companion
as
they
stood
together
by
the
stream
hesitating
and
almost
despairing
it
occurred
to
isaac
that
the
rivulet
might
lead
to
a
larger
stream
of
water
and
that
to
the
sea
and
the
white
settlements
near
it
and
he
resolved
to
follow
it
they
again
began
their
painful
march
the
day
passed
and
the
night
once
more
overtook
them
when
the
eighth
morning
dawned
the
younger
of
the
boys
found
himself
unable
to
rise
from
his
bed
of
leaves
isaac
endeavored
to
encourage
him
dug
roots
and
procured
water
for
him
but
the
poor
lad
was
utterly
exhausted
he
had
no
longer
heart
or
hope
the
elder
boy
laid
him
on
leaves
and
dry
grass
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
and
with
a
heavy
heart
bade
him
farewell
alone
he
slowly
and
painfully
proceeded
down
the
stream
now
greatly
increased
in
size
by
tributary
rivulets
on
the
top
of
a
hill
he
climbed
with
difficulty
into
a
tree
and
saw
in
the
distance
what
seemed
to
be
a
clearing
and
a
newly
raised
frame
building
hopeful
and
rejoicing
he
turned
back
to
his
young
companion
told
him
what
he
had
seen
and
after
chafing
his
limbs
awhile
got
him
upon
his
feet
sometimes
supporting
him
and
at
others
carrying
him
on
his
back
the
heroic
boy
staggered
towards
the
clearing
on
reaching
it
he
found
it
deserted
and
was
obliged
to
continue
his
journey
towards
night
signs
of
civilization
began
to
appear
the
heavy
continuous
roar
of
water
was
heard
and
presently
emerging
from
the
forest
he
saw
a
great
river
dashing
in
white
foam
down
precipitous
rocks
and
on
its
bank
the
gray
walls
of
a
huge
stone
building
with
flankers
palisades
and
moat
over
which
the
british
flag
was
flying
this
was
the
famous
saco
fort
built
by
governor
phips
two
years
before
just
below
the
falls
of
the
saco
river
the
soldiers
of
the
garrison
gave
the
poor
fellows
a
kindly
welcome
joseph
who
was
scarcely
alive
lay
for
a
long
time
sick
in
the
fort
but
isaac
soon
regained
his
strength
and
set
out
for
his
home
in
haverhill
which
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
arrive
at
in
safety
amidst
the
stirring
excitements
of
the
present
day
when
every
thrill
of
the
electric
wire
conveys
a
new
subject
for
thought
or
action
to
a
generation
as
eager
as
the
ancient
athenians
for
some
new
thing
simple
legends
of
the
past
like
that
which
we
have
transcribed
have
undoubtedly
lost
in
a
great
degree
their
interest
the
lore
of
the
fireside
is
becoming
obsolete
and
with
the
octogenarian
few
who
still
linger
among
us
will
perish
the
unwritten
history
of
border
life
in
new
england
the
black
men
in
the
revolution
and
war
of
the
return
of
the
festival
of
our
national
independence
has
called
our
attention
to
a
matter
which
has
been
very
carefully
kept
out
of
sight
by
orators
and
we
allude
to
the
participation
of
colored
men
in
the
great
struggle
for
american
freedom
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
our
taste
or
our
principles
to
eulogize
the
shedders
of
blood
even
in
a
cause
of
acknowledged
justice
but
when
we
see
a
whole
nation
doing
honor
to
the
memories
of
one
class
of
its
defenders
to
the
total
neglect
of
another
class
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
of
darker
complexion
we
can
not
forego
the
satisfaction
of
inviting
notice
to
certain
historical
facts
which
for
the
last
half
century
have
been
quietly
elbowed
aside
as
no
more
deserving
of
a
place
in
patriotic
recollection
than
the
descendants
of
the
men
to
whom
the
facts
in
question
relate
have
to
a
place
in
a
fourth
of
july
procession
of
the
services
and
sufferings
of
the
colored
soldiers
of
the
revolution
no
attempt
has
to
our
knowledge
been
made
to
preserve
a
record
they
have
had
no
historian
with
here
and
there
an
exception
they
have
all
passed
away
and
only
some
faint
tradition
of
their
campaigns
under
washington
and
greene
and
lafayette
and
of
their
cruisings
under
decatur
and
barry
lingers
among
their
descendants
yet
enough
is
known
to
show
that
the
free
colored
men
of
the
united
states
bore
their
full
proportion
of
the
sacrifices
and
trials
of
the
revolutionary
war
the
late

eustis
of
massachusetts
the
pride
and
boast
of

war
dated
at
the
close
of
it
wholly
in
the
handwriting
of
george
washington
nor
can
i
forget
the
expression
of
his
feelings
when
informed
after
his
discharge
had
been
sent
to
the
war
department
that
it
could
not
be
returned
at
his
request
it
was
written
for
as
he
seemed
inclined
to
spurn
the
pension
and
reclaim
the
discharge
there
is
a
touching
anecdote
related
of
baron
stenben
on
the
occasion
of
the
disbandment
of
the
american
army
a
black
soldier
with
his
wounds
unhealed
utterly
destitute
stood
on
the
wharf
just
as
a
vessel
bound
for
his
distant
home
was
getting
under
way
the
poor
fellow
gazed
at
the
vessel
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
gave
himself
up
to
despair
the
foreigner
witnessed
his
emotion
and
inquiring
into
the
cause
of
it
took
his
last
dollar
from
his
purse
and
gave
it
to
him
with
tears
of
sympathy
trickling
down
his
cheeks
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
the
poor
wounded
soldier
hailed
the
sloop
and
was
received
on
board
as
it
moved
out
from
the
wharf
he
cried
back
to
his
noble
friend
on
shore
god
almighty
bless
you
master
baron
in
rhode
island
says
governor
eustis
in
his
able
speech
against
slavery
in
missouri
of
twelfth
month
the
blacks
formed
an
entire
regiment
and
they
discharged
their
duty
with
zeal
and
fidelity
the
gallant
defence
of
red
bank
in
which
the
black
regiment
bore
a
part
is
among
the
proofs
of
their
valor
in
this
contest
it
will
be
recollected
that
four
hundred
men
met
and
repulsed
after
a
terrible
and
sanguinary
struggle
fifteen
hundred
hessian
troops
headed
by
count
donop
the
glory
of
the
defence
of
red
bank
which
has
been
pronounced
one
of
the
most
heroic
actions
of
the
war
belongs
in
reality
to
black
men
yet
who
now
hears
them
spoken
of
in
connection
with
it
among
the
traits
which
distinguished
the
black
regiment
was
devotion
to
their
officers
in
the
attack
made
upon
the
american
lines
near
croton
river
on
the
of
the
fifth
month
colonel
greene
the
commander
of
the
regiment
was
cut
down
and
mortally
wounded
but
the
sabres
of
the
enemy
only
reached
him
through
the
bodies
of
his
faithful
guard
of
blacks
who
hovered
over
him
to
protect
him
every
one
of
whom
was
killed
the
late
harris
of
dunbarton
new
hampshire
a
revolutionary
veteran
stated
in
a
speech
at
francistown
new
hampshire
some
years
ago
that
on
one
occasion
the
regiment
to
which
he
was
attached
was
commanded
to
defend
an
important
position
which
the
enemy
thrice
assailed
and
from
which
they
were
as
often
repulsed
there
was
said
the
venerable
speaker
a
regiment
of
blacks
in
the
same
situation
a
regiment
of
negroes
fighting
for
our
liberty
and
independence
not
a
white
man
among
them
but
the
officers
in
the
same
dangerous
and
responsible
position
had
they
been
unfaithful
or
given
way
before
the
enemy
all
would
have
been
lost
three
times
in
succession
were
they
attacked
with
most
desperate
fury
by
disciplined
and
veteran
troops
and
three
times
did
they
successfully
repel
the
assault
and
thus
preserve
an
army
they
fought
thus
through
the
war
they
were
brave
and
hardy
troops
in
the
debate
in
the
new
york
convention
of
for
amending
the
constitution
of
the
state
on
the
question
of
extending
the
right
of

the
delegate
from

county
and
other

made
honorable
mention
of
the
services
of
the
colored
troops
in
the
revolutionary
army
the
late
james
forten
of
philadelphia
well
known
as
a
colored
man
of
wealth
intelligence
and
philanthropy
enlisted
in
the
american
navy
under
captain
decatur
of
the
royal
louis
was
taken
prisoner
during
his
second
cruise
and
with
nineteen
other
colored
men
confined
on
board
the
horrible
jersey
all
the
vessels
in
the
american
service
at
that
period
were
partly
manned
by
blacks
the
old
citizens
of
philadelphia
to
this
day
remember
the
fact
that
when
the
troops
of
the
north
marched
through
the
city
one
or
more
colored
companies
were
attached
to
nearly
all
the
regiments
governor
eustis
in
the
speech
before
quoted
states
that
the
free
colored
soldiers
entered
the
ranks
with
the
whites
the
time
of
those
who
were
slaves
was
purchased
of
their
masters
and
they
were
induced
to
enter
the
service
in
consequence
of
a
law
of
congress
by
which
on
condition
of
their
serving
in
the
ranks
during
the
war
they
were
made
freemen
this
hope
of
liberty
inspired
them
with
courage
to
oppose
their
breasts
to
the
hessian
bayonet
at
red
bank
and
enabled
them
to
endure
with
fortitude
the
cold
and
famine
of
valley
forge
the
anecdote
of
the
slave
of
general
sullivan
of
new
hampshire
is
well
known
when
his
master
told
him
that
they
were
on
the
point
of
starting
for
the
army
to
fight
for
liberty
he
shrewdly
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
great
satisfaction
to
know
that
he
was
indeed
going
to
fight
for
his
liberty
struck
with
the
reasonableness
and
justice
of
this
suggestion
general

at
once
gave
him
his
freedom
the
late

rhode

had
a
number
of
slaves
a
regiment
of
them
were
enlisted
into
the
continental
service
and
no
braver
men
met
the
enemy
in
battle
but
not
one
of
them
was
permitted
to
be
a
soldier
until
he
had

made
the
following
admissions
they
the
colored
people
were
in
numerous
instances
the
pioneers
and
in
all
the
laborers
of
our
armies
to
their
hands

greatest
part
of
the
fortifications

for
the

period
of

valor
of

immortality
to

in

numerous
bodies
of
them
were
enrolled
and
fought
side
by
side
with
the

at
the
battles
of
the

let
us
now
look
forward
thirty
or
forty
years
to
the
last
war
with
great
britain
and
see
whether
the
whites
enjoyed
a
monopoly
of
patriotism
at
that
time
martindale
of
new

or
negroes
who
had
been
slaves
were
enlisted
as
soldiers
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
i
myself
saw
a
battalion
of
them
as
fine
men
as
i
ever

attached

appearance
clarke
in
the
convention
which
revised
the
constitution

in
speaking
of
the
colored
inhabitants
of

said
in
your
late
war
they
contributed
largely
towards
some
of
your
most
splendid
victories
on
lakes
erie
and
champlain
where
your
fleets
triumphed
over
a
foe
superior
in
numbers
and
engines
of
death
they
were
manned
in
a
large
proportion
with
men
of
color
and
in
this
very
house
in
the
fall
of
a
bill
passed
receiving
the
approbation
of
all
the
branches
of
your
government
authorizing
the
governor
to
accept
the
services
of
a
corps
of
two
thousand
free
people
of
color
sir
these
were
times
which
tried
men
souls
in
these
times
it
was
no
sporting
matter
to
bear
arms
these
were
times
when
a
man
who
shouldered
his
musket
did
not
know
but
he
bared
his
bosom
to
receive
a
from
the
enemy
ere
he
laid
it
aside
and
in
these
times
these
people
were
found
as
ready
and
as
willing
to
volunteer
in
your
service
as
any
other
they
were
not
compelled
to
go
they
were
not
drafted
no
your
pride
had
placed
them
beyond
your
compulsory
power
but
there
was
no
necessity
for
its
exercise
they
were
volunteers
yes
sir
volunteers
to
defend
that
very
country
from
the
inroads
and
ravages
of
a
ruthless
and
vindictive
foe
which
had
treated
them
with
insult
degradation
and
slavery
on
the
capture
of
washington
by
the
british
forces
it
was
judged
expedient
to
fortify
without
delay
the
principal
towns
and
cities
exposed
to
similar
attacks
the
vigilance
committee
of
philadelphia
waited
upon
three
of
the
principal
colored
citizens
namely
james
forten
bishop
allen
and
absalom
jones
soliciting
the
aid
of
the
people
of
color
in
erecting
suitable
defences
for
the
city
accordingly
hundred
colored
then
assembled
in
the
yard
and
from
thence
marched
to
gray
ferry
where
they
labored
for
two
days
almost
without
intermission
their
labors
were
so
faithful
and
efficient
that
a
vote
of
thanks
was
tendered
them
by
the
committee
a
battalion
of
colored
troops
was
at
the
same
time
organized
in
the
city
under
an
officer
of
the
united
states
army
and
they
were
on
the
point
of
marching
to
the
frontier
when
peace
was
proclaimed
general
jackson
proclamations
to
the
free
colored
inhabitants
of
louisiana
are
well
known
in
his
first
inviting
them
to
take
up
arms
he
said
as
sons
of
freedom
you
are
now
called
on
to
defend
our
most
inestimable
blessings
as
americans
your
country
looks
with
confidence
to
her
adopted
children
for
a
valorous
support
as
fathers
husbands
and
brothers
you
are
summoned
to
rally
round
the
standard
of
the
eagle
to
defend
all
which
is
dear
in
existence
the
second
proclamation
is
one
of
the
highest
compliments
ever
paid
by
a
military
chief
to
his
soldiers
to
the
free
people
of
color
soldiers
when
on
the
banks
of
the
mobile
i
called
you
to
take
up
arms
inviting
you
to
partake
the
perils
and
glory
of
your
white
citizens
i
expected
much
from
you
for
i
was
not
ignorant
that
you
possessed
qualities
most
formidable
to
an
invading
enemy
i
knew
with
what
fortitude
you
could
endure
hunger
and
thirst
and
all
the
fatigues
of
a
campaign
i
knew
well
how
you
loved
your
native
country
and
that
you
as
well
as
ourselves
had
to
defend
what
man
holds
most
dear
his
parents
wife
children
and
property
you
have
done
more
than
i
expected
in
addition
to
the
previous
qualities
i
before
knew
you
to
possess
i
found
among
you
a
noble
enthusiasm
which
leads
to
the
performance
of
great
things
soldiers
the
president
of
the
united
states
shall
hear
how
praiseworthy
was
your
conduct
in
the
hour
of
danger
and
the
representatives
of
the
american
people
will
give
you
the
praise
your
exploits
entitle
you
to
your
general
anticipates
them
in
applauding
your
noble
ardor
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
whatever
honor
belongs
to
the
heroes
of
the
revolution
and
the
volunteers
in
the
second
war
for
independence
is
to
be
divided
between
the
white
and
the
colored
man
we
have
dwelt
upon
this
subject
at
length
not
because
it
accords
with
our
principles
or
feelings
for
it
is
scarcely
necessary
for
us
to
say
that
we
are
one
of
those
who
hold
that
peace
hath
her
victories
no
less
renowned
than
war
and
certainly
far
more
desirable
and
useful
but
because
in
popular
estimation
the
patriotism
which
dares
and
does
on
the
takes
a
higher
place
than
the
quiet
exercise
of
the
duties
of
peaceful
citizenship
and
we
are
willing
that
colored
soldiers
with
their
descendants
should
have
the
benefit
if
possible
of
a
public
sentiment
which
has
so
extravagantly
lauded
their
white
companions
in
arms
if
pulpits
must
be
desecrated
by
eulogies
of
the
patriotism
of
bloodshed
we
see
no
reason
why
black
defenders
of
their
country
in
the
war
for
liberty
should
not
receive
honorable
mention
as
well
as
white
invaders
of
a
neighboring
republic
who
have
volunteered
in
a
war
for
plunder
and
slavery
extension
for
the
latter
class
of
heroes
we
have
very
little
respect
the
patriotism
of
too
many
of
them
forcibly
reminds
us
of
johnson
definition
of
that
term
patriotism
sir
is
the
last
refuge
of
a
scoundrel
what
right

demand
said
an
american
orator
some
years
ago
have
the
children
of
africa
to
a
homestead
in
the
white
man
country
the
answer
will
in
part
be
found
in
the
facts
which
we
have
presented
their
right
like
that
of
their
white
dates

dread

no

in
the

which
have
grown
out
of

for

they

is
it
just

is
it
safe
even
to

a

cast

transportation
for
fourteen
years
and
was
removed
to
the
edinburgh
jail
from
thence
to
the
hulks
and
lastly
to
the
containing
convicts
which
conveyed
him
to
botany
bay
the
next
victim
was
palmer
a
learned
and
highly
accomplished
unitarian
minister
in
dundee
he
was
greatly
beloved
and
respected
as
a
polished
gentleman
and
sincere
friend
of
the
people
he
was
charged
with
circulating
a
republican
tract
and
was
sentenced
to
seven
transportation
but
the
friends
of
the
people
were
not
quelled
by
this
summary
punishment
of
two
of
their
devoted
leaders
in
the
tenth
month
delegates
were
called
together
from
various
towns
in
scotland
as
well
as
from
birmingham
sheffield
and
other
places
in
england
gerrald
and
margarot
were
sent
up
by
the
london
society
after
a
brief
sitting
the
convention
was
dispersed
by
the
public
authorities
its
sessions
were
opened
and
closed
with
prayer
and
the
speeches
of
its
members
manifested
the
pious
enthusiasm
of
the
old
cameronians
and
of
the
times
of
cromwell
many
of
the
dissenting
clergy
were
present
william
skirving
the
most
determined
of
the
band
had
been
educated
for
the
ministry
and
was
a
sincerely
religious
man
joseph
gerrald
was
a
young
man
of
brilliant
talents
and
exemplary
character
when
the
sheriff
entered
the
hall
to
disperse
the
friends
of
liberty
gerrald
knelt
in
prayer
his
remarkable
words
were
taken
down
by
a
reporter
on
the
spot
there
is
nothing
in
modern
history
to
compare
with
this
supplication
unless
it
be
that
of
sir
henry
vane
a
kindred
martyr
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
just
before
his
execution
it
is
the
prayer
of
universal
humanity
which
god
will
yet
hear
and
answer
o
thou
governor
of
the
universe
we
rejoice
that
at
all
times
and
in
all
circumstances
we
have
liberty
to
approach
thy
throne
and
that
we
are
assured
that
no
sacrifice
is
more
acceptable
to
thee
than
that
which
is
made
for
the
relief
of
the
oppressed
in
this
moment
of
trial
and
persecution
we
pray
that
thou
wouldst
be
our
defender
our
counsellor
and
our
guide
oh
be
thou
a
pillar
of
fire
to
us
as
thou
wast
to
our
fathers
of
old
to
enlighten
and
direct
us
and
to
our
enemies
a
pillar
of
cloud
and
darkness
and
confusion
thou
art
thyself
the
great
patron
of
liberty
thy
service
is
perfect
freedom
prosper
we
beseech
thee
every
endeavor
which
we
make
to
promote
thy
cause
for
we
consider
the
cause
of
truth
or
every
cause
which
tends
to
promote
the
happiness
of
thy
creatures
as
thy
cause
o
thou
merciful
father
of
mankind
enable
us
for
thy
name
sake
to
endure
persecution
with
fortitude
and
may
we
believe
that
all
trials
and
tribulations
of
life
which
we
endure
shall
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
thee
and
grant
that
the
greater
the
evil
and
the
longer
it
may
be
continued
the
greater
good
in
thy
holy
and
adorable
providence
may
be
produced
therefrom
and
this
we
beg
not
for
our
own
merits
but
through
the
merits
of
him
who
is
hereafter
to
judge
the
world
in
righteousness
and
mercy
he
ceased
and
the
sheriff
who
had
been
temporarily
overawed
by
the
extraordinary
scene
enforced
the
warrant
and
the
meeting
was
broken
up
the
delegates
descended
to
the
street
in
silence
arthur
seat
and
salisbury
crags
glooming
in
the
distance
and
night
an
immense
and
agitated
multitude
waiting
around
over
which
tossed
the
flaring
flambeaux
of
the
sheriff
train
gerrald
who
was
already
under
arrest
as
he
descended
spoke
aloud
behold
the
funeral
torches
of
liberty
skirving
and
several
others
were
immediately
arrested
they
were
tried
in
the
first
month
and
sentenced
as
muir
and
palmer
had
previously
been
to
transportation
their
conduct
throughout
was
worthy
of
their
great
and
holy
cause
gerrald
defence
was
that
of
freedom
rather
than
his
own
forgetting
himself
he
spoke
out
manfully
and
earnestly
for
the
poor
the
oppressed
the
overtaxed
and
starving
millions
of
his
countrymen
that
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
this
noble
plea
for
liberty
i
give
an
extract
from
the
concluding
paragraphs
true
religion
like
all
free
governments
appeals
to
the
understanding
for
its
support
and
not
to
the
sword
all
systems
whether
civil
or
moral
can
only
be
durable
in
proportion
as
they
are
founded
on
truth
and
calculated
to
promote
the
good
of
mankind
this
will
account
to
us
why
governments
suited
to
the
great
energies
of
man
have
always
outlived
the
perishable
things
which
despotism
has
erected
yes
this
will
account
to
us
why
the
stream
of
time
which
is
continually
washing
away
the
dissoluble
fabrics
of
superstitions
and
impostures
passes
without
injury
by
the
adamant
of
christianity
those
who
are
versed
in
the
history
of
their
country
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
must
know
that
rigorous
state
prosecutions
have
always
preceded
the
era
of
convulsion
and
this
era
i
fear
will
be
accelerated
by
the
folly
and
madness
of
our
rulers
if
the
people
are
discontented
the
proper
mode
of
quieting
their
discontent
is
not
by
instituting
rigorous
and
sanguinary
prosecutions
but
by
redressing
their
wrongs
and
conciliating
their
affections
courts
of
justice
indeed
may
be
called
in
to
the
aid
of
ministerial
vengeance
but
if
once
the
purity
of
their
proceedings
is
suspected
they
will
cease
to
be
objects
of
reverence
to
the
nation
they
will
degenerate
into
empty
and
expensive
pageantry
and
become
the
partial
instruments
of
vexatious
oppression
whatever
may
become
of
me
my
principles
will
last
forever
individuals
may
perish
but
truth
is
eternal
the
rude
blasts
of
tyranny
may
blow
from
every
quarter
but
freedom
is
that
hardy
plant
which
will
survive
the
tempest
and
strike
an
everlasting
root
into
the
most
unfavorable
soil
gentlemen
i
am
in
your
hands
about
my
life
i
feel
not
the
slightest
anxiety
if
it
would
promote
the
cause
i
would
cheerfully
make
the
sacrifice
for
if
i
perish
on
an
occasion
like
the
present
out
of
my
ashes
will
arise
a
flame
to
consume
the
tyrants
and
oppressors
of
my
country
years
have
passed
and
the
generation
which
knew
the
persecuted
reformers
has
given
place
to
another
and
now
half
a
century
after
william
skirving
as
he
rose
to
receive
his
sentence
declared
to
his
judges
you
may
condemn
us
as
felons
but
your
sentence
shall
yet
be
reversed
by
the
people
the
names
of
these
men
are
once
more
familiar
to
british
lips
the
sentence
has
been
reversed
the
prophecy
of
skirving
has
become
history
on
the
of
the
eighth
month
the
of
a
monument
to
the
memory
of
the
scottish
martyrs
for
which
subscriptions
had
been
received
from
such
men
as
lord
holland
the
dukes
of
bedford
and
norfolk
and
the
earls
of
essex
and
leicester
was
laid
with
imposing
ceremonies
in
the
beautiful
of
calton
hill
edinburgh
by
the
veteran
reformer
and
tribune
of
the
people
joseph
hume
after
delivering
an
appropriate
address
the
aged
radical
closed
the
impressive
scene
by
reading
the
prayer
of
joseph
gerrald
at
the
banquet
which
afterwards
took
place
and
which
was
presided
over
by
john
dunlop
addresses
were
made
by
the
president
and
ritchie
and
by
william
skirving
of
kirkaldy
son
of
the
martyr
the
complete
suffrage
association
of
edinburgh
to
the
number
of
five
hundred
walked
in
procession
to
calton
hill
and
in
the
open
air
proclaimed
unmolested
the
very
principles
for
which
the
martyrs
of
the
past
century
had
suffered
the
account
of
this
tribute
to
the
memory
of
departed
worth
can
not
fail
to
awaken
in
generous
hearts
emotions
of
gratitude
towards
him
who
has
thus
signally
vindicated
his
truth
showing
that
the
triumph
of
the
oppressor
is
but
for
a
season
and
that
even
in
this
world
a
lie
can
not
live
forever
well
and
truly
did
george
fox
say
in
his
last
days
the
truth
is
above
all
will
it
be
said
however
that
this
tribute
comes
too
late
that
it
can
not
solace
those
brave
hearts
which
slowly
broken
by
the
long
agony
of
colonial
servitude
are
now
cold
in
strange
graves
it
is
indeed
a
striking
illustration
of
the
truth
that
he
who
would
benefit
his
man
must
walk
by
faith
sowing
his
seed
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
withholding
not
his
hand
knowing
only
this
that
in
god
good
time
the
harvest
shall
spring
up
and
ripen
if
not
for
himself
yet
for
others
who
as
they
bind
the
full
sheaves
and
gather
in
the
heavy
clusters
may
perchance
remember
him
with
gratitude
and
set
up
stones
of
memorial
on
the
fields
of
his
toil
and
sacrifices
we
may
regret
that
in
this
stage
of
the
spirit
life
the
sincere
and
worker
is
not
always
permitted
to
partake
of
the
fruits
of
his
toil
or
receive
the
honors
of
a
benefactor
we
hear
his
good
evil
spoken
of
and
his
noblest
sacrifices
counted
as
naught
we
see
him
not
only
assailed
by
the
wicked
but
discountenanced
and
shunned
by
the
timidly
good
followed
on
his
hot
and
dusty
pathway
by
the
execrations
of
the
hounding
mob
and
the
contemptuous
pity
of
the
worldly
wise
and
prudent
and
when
at
last
the
horizon
of
time
shuts
down
between
him
and
ourselves
and
the
places
which
have
known
him
know
him
no
more
forever
we
are
almost
ready
to
say
with
the
regal
voluptuary
of
old
this
also
is
vanity
and
a
great
evil
for
what
hath
a
man
of
all
his
labor
and
of
the
vexation
of
his
heart
wherein
he
hath
labored
under
the
sun
but
is
this
the
end
has
universe
no
wider
limits
than
the
circle
of
the
blue
wall
which
shuts
in
our
has
life
infancy
only
been
provided
for
and
beyond
this
poor
of
time
is
there
no
playground
for
the
soul
youth
no
broad
fields
for
its
manhood
perchance
could
we
but
lift
the
curtains
of
the
narrow
pinfold
wherein
we
dwell
we
might
see
that
our
poor
friend
and
brother
whose
fate
we
have
thus
deplored
has
by
no
means
lost
the
reward
of
his
labors
but
that
in
new
fields
of
duty
he
is
cheered
even
by
the
tardy
recognition
of
the
value
of
his
services
in
the
old
the
continuity
of
life
is
never
broken
the
river
flows
onward
and
is
lost
to
our
sight
but
under
its
new
horizon
it
carries
the
same
waters
which
it
gathered
under
ours
and
its
unseen
valleys
are
made
glad
by
the
offerings
which
are
borne
down
to
them
from
the
past
flowers
perchance
the
germs
of
which
its
own
waves
had
planted
on
the
banks
of
time
who
shall
say
that
the
mournful
and
repentant
love
with
which
the
benefactors
of
our
race
are
at
length
regarded
may
not
be
to
them
in
their
new
condition
of
being
sweet
and
grateful
as
the
perfume
of
forgotten
flowers
or
that
our
of
rejoicing
may
not
reach
the
ears
of
those
who
in
weakness
and
suffering
scattered
the
seeds
of
blessing
the
history
of
the
edinburgh
reformers
is
no
new
one
it
is
that
of
all
who
seek
to
benefit
their
age
by
rebuking
its
popular
crimes
and
exposing
its
cherished
errors
the
truths
which
they
told
were
not
believed
and
for
that
very
reason
were
the
more
needed
for
it
is
evermore
the
case
that
the
right
word
when
first
uttered
is
an
unpopular
and
denied
one
hence
he
who
undertakes
to
tread
the
thorny
pathway
of
reform
who
smitten
with
the
love
of
truth
and
justice
or
indignant
in
view
of
wrong
and
insolent
oppression
is
rashly
inclined
to
throw
himself
at
once
into
that
great
conflict
which
the
persian
seer
not
untruly
represented
as
a
war
between
light
and
darkness
would
do
well
to
count
the
cost
in
the
outset
if
he
can
live
for
truth
alone
and
cut
off
from
the
general
sympathy
regard
her
service
as
its
own
exceeding
great
reward
if
he
can
bear
to
be
counted
a
fanatic
and
crazy
visionary
if
in
all
good
nature
he
is
ready
to
receive
from
the
very
objects
of
his
solicitude
abuse
and
obloquy
in
return
for
disinterested
and
efforts
for
their
welfare
if
with
his
purest
motives
misunderstood
and
his
best
actions
perverted
and
distorted
into
crimes
he
can
still
hold
on
his
way
and
patiently
abide
the
hour
when
the
whirligig
of
time
shall
bring
about
its
revenges
if
on
the
whole
he
is
prepared
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
sort
of
moral
outlaw
or
social
heretic
under
good
interdict
of
food
and
fire
and
if
he
is
well
assured
that
he
can
through
all
this
preserve
his
cheerfulness
and
faith
in
man
let
him
gird
up
his
loins
and
go
forward
in
god
name
he
is
fitted
for
his
vocation
he
has
watched
all
night
by
his
armor
whatever
his
trial
may
be
he
is
prepared
he
may
even
be
happily
disappointed
in
respect
to
it
flowers
of
unexpected
refreshing
may
overhang
the
hedges
of
his
strait
and
narrow
way
but
it
remains
to
be
true
that
he
who
serves
his
contemporaries
in
faithfulness
and
sincerity
must
expect
no
wages
from
their
gratitude
for
as
has
been
well
said
there
is
after
all
but
one
way
of
doing
the
world
good
and
unhappily
that
way
the
world
does
not
like
for
it
consists
in
telling
it
the
very
thing
which
it
does
not
wish
to
hear
unhappily
in
the
case
of
the
reformer
his
most
dangerous
foes
are
those
of
his
own
household
true
the
world
garden
has
become
a
desert
and
needs
renovation
but
is
his
own
little
nook
weedless
sin
abounds
without
but
is
his
own
heart
pure
while
smiting
down
the
giants
and
dragons
which
beset
the
outward
world
are
there
no
evil
guests
sitting
by
his
own
ambition
envy
impatience
dogmatism
and
pride
of
opinion
stand
at
his
ready
to
enter
whenever
he
leaves
it
unguarded
then
too
there
is
no
small
danger
of
failing
to
discriminate
between
a
rational
philanthropy
with
its
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
and
that
spiritual
which
undertakes
the
championship
of
every
novel
project
of
reform
scouring
the
world
in
search
of
distressed
schemes
held
in
durance
by
common
sense
and
vagaries
happily
spellbound
by
ridicule
he
must
learn
that
although
the
most
needful
truth
may
be
unpopular
it
does
not
follow
that
unpopularity
is
a
proof
of
the
truth
of
his
doctrines
or
the
expediency
of
his
measures
he
must
have
the
liberality
to
admit
that
it
is
barely
possible
for
the
public
on
some
points
to
be
right
and
himself
wrong
and
that
the
blessing
invoked
upon
those
who
suffer
for
righteousness
is
not
available
to
such
as
court
persecution
and
invite
contempt
for
folly
has
its
martyrs
as
well
as
wisdom
and
he
who
has
nothing
better
to
show
of
himself
than
the
scars
and
bruises
which
the
popular
foot
has
left
upon
him
is
not
even
sure
of
winning
the
honors
of
martyrdom
as
some
compensation
for
the
loss
of
dignity
and
involved
in
the
exhibition
of
its
pains
to
the
reformer
in
an
especial
manner
comes
home
the
truth
that
whoso
ruleth
his
own
spirit
is
greater
than
he
who
taketh
a
city
patience
hope
charity
watchfulness
unto
prayer
how
needful
are
all
these
to
his
success
without
them
he
is
in
danger
of
ingloriously
giving
up
his
contest
with
error
and
prejudice
at
the
first
repulse
or
with
that
spiteful
philanthropy
which
we
sometimes
witness
taking
a
sick
world
by
the
nose
like
a
spoiled
child
and
endeavoring
to
force
down
its
throat
the
nostrums
prepared
for
its
relief
what
then
shall
we
in
view
of
these
things
call
back
young
generous
spirits
just
entering
upon
the
perilous
pathway
god
forbid
welcome
thrice
welcome
rather
let
them
go
forward
not
unwarned
of
the
dangers
nor
unreminded
of
the
pleasures
which
belong
to
the
service
of
humanity
great
is
the
consciousness
of
right
sweet
is
the
answer
of
a
good
conscience
he
who
pays
his
homage
to
truth
and
duty
who
swears
his
lifelong
fealty
on

to
the

an
atmosphere
which
the

which
they
can

rests
over
him
glorious
in
its
purity
and
stillness
nor
is
he
altogether
without
kindly
human
sympathies
all
generous
and
earnest
hearts
which
are

that

his

overcomes

the

unrolls
itself
before
him
with
its
waving
springing
up
from
the
seed
he

the

with

of

who
feels
that
he

not

idle

useless

with
hopeful

and
strong

has

with

in

no

however
small
put

fails
of

no

however
feeble
lifted

for

ever
dies
amidst
the
confused
noises
of

through
discords
of
sin
and
sorrow
pain
and
wrong
it
rises
a
deathless
melody
whose
notes
of
wailing
are
hereafter
to
be
changed
to
those
of
triumph
as
they
blend
with
the
great
harmony
of
a
reconciled
universe
the
language
of
a
transatlantic
reformer
to
his
friends
is
then
as
true
as
it
is
hopeful
and
cheering
triumph
is
certain
we
have
espoused
no
losing
cause
in
the

we
may
not
join
our
shout
with
the
victors
but
in
spirit
we
may
even
now
there
is
but
an
interval
of
time
between
us
and
the
success
at
which
we
aim
in
all
other
respects
the
links
of
the
chain
are
complete
identifying
ourselves
with
immortal
and
immutable
principles
we
share
both
their
immortality
and
immutability
the
vow
which
unites
us
with
truth
makes
futurity
present
with
us
our
being
resolves
itself
into
an
everlasting
now
it
is
not
so
correct
to
say
that
we
shall
be
victorious
as
that
we
are
so
when
we
will
in
unison
with
the
supreme
mind
the
characteristics
of

will
become
in
some
sort
those
of
ours
what
he
has
willed
is
virtually
done
it
may
take
ages
to
unfold
itself
but
the
germ
of
its
whole
history
is
wrapped
up
in
his
determination
when
we
make
his
will
ours
which
we
do
when
we
aim
at
truth
that
upon
which
we
are
resolved
is
done
decided
born
life
is
in
it
it
is
and
the
future
is
but
the
development
of
its
being
ours
therefore
is
a
perpetual
triumph
our
deeds
are
all
of

of
the
anniversary
of
the
landing
of
the

at
plymouth
december
no
one
can
appreciate
more
highly
than
myself
the
noble
qualities
of
the
men
and
women
of
the
mayflower
it
is
not
of
them
that
i
a
descendant
of
the
sect
called
quakers
have
reason
to
complain
in
the
matter
of
persecution
a
generation
which
came
after
them
with
less
piety
and
more
bigotry
is
especially
responsible
for
the
little
unpleasantness
referred
to
and
the
sufferers
from
it
scarcely
need
any
present
championship
they
certainly
did
not
wait
altogether
for
the
revenges
of
posterity
if
they
lost
their
ears
it
is
satisfactory
to
remember
that
they
made
those
of
their
mutilators
tingle
with
a
rhetoric
more
sharp
than
polite
a
worthy
new
england
deacon
once
described
a
brother
in
the
church
as
a
very
good
man
godward
but
rather
hard
it
can
not
be
denied
that
some
very
satisfactory
steps
have
been
taken
in
the
latter
direction
at
least
since
the
days
of
the
pilgrims
our
age
is
tolerant
of
creed
and
dogma
broader
in
its
sympathies
more
keenly
sensitive
to
temporal
need
and
practically
recognizing
the
brotherhood
of
the
race
wherever
a
cry
of
suffering
is
heard
its
response
is
quick
and
generous
it
has
abolished
slavery
and
is
lifting
woman
from
degradation
to
equality
with
man
before
the
law
our
criminal
codes
no
longer
embody
the
maxim
of
barbarism
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
but
have
regard
not
only
for
the
safety
of
the
community
but
to
the
reform
and
of
the
criminal
all
the
more
however
for
this
amiable
tenderness
do
we
need
the
counterpoise
of
a
strong
sense
of
justice
with
our
sympathy
for
the
we
need
the
old
puritan
and
quaker
hatred
of
wrongdoing
with
our
just
tolerance
of
men
and
opinions
a
righteous
abhorrence
of
sin
all
the
more
for
the
sweet
humanities
and
christian
liberalism
which
in
drawing
men
nearer
to
each
other
are
increasing
the
sum
of
social
influences
for
good
or
evil
we
need
the
bracing
atmosphere
healthful
if
austere
of
the
old
moralities
individual
and
social
duties
are
quite
as
imperative
now
as
when
they
were
minutely
specified
in
and
enforced
by
penalties
no
longer
admissible
it
is
well
that
stocks
and
stool
are
now
only
matters
of
tradition
but
the
honest
reprobation
of
vice
and
crime
which
they
symbolized
should
by
no
means
perish
with
them
the
true
life
of
a
nation
is
in
its
personal
morality
and
no
excellence
of
constitution
and
laws
can
avail
much
if
the
people
lack
purity
and
integrity
culture
art
refinement
care
for
our
own
comfort
and
that
of
others
are
all
well
but
truth
honor
reverence
and
fidelity
to
duty
are
indispensable
the
pilgrims
were
right
in
affirming
the
paramount
authority
of
the
law
of
god
if
they
erred
in
seeking
that
authoritative
law
and
passed
over
the
sermon
on
the
mount
for
the
stern
hebraisms
of
moses
if
they
hesitated
in
view
of
the
largeness
of
christian
liberty
if
they
seemed
unwilling
to
accept
the
sweetness
and
light
of
the
good
tidings
let
us
not
forget
that
it
was
the
mistake
of
men
who
feared
more
than
they
dared
to
hope
whose
estimate
of
the
exceeding
awfulness
of
sin
caused
them
to
dwell
upon
god
vengeance
rather
than
his
compassion
and
whose
dread
of
evil
was
so
great
that
in
shutting
their
hearts
against
it
they
sometimes
shut
out
the
good
it
is
well
for
us
if
we
have
learned
to
listen
to
the
sweet
persuasion
of
the
beatitudes
but
there
are
crises
in
all
lives
which
require
also
the
emphatic
thou
shalt
not
or
the
decalogue
which
the
founders
wrote
on
the
of
their
commonwealth
let
us
then
be
thankful
for
the
assurances
which
the
last
few
years
have
afforded
us
that
the
pilgrim
spirit
is
not
dead
but
walks
in
noon
broad
light
we
have
seen
it
in
the
faith
and
trust
which
no
circumstances
could
shake
in
heroic
in
entire
consecration
to
duty
the
fathers
have
lived
in
their
sons
have
we
not
all
known
the
winthrops
and
brewsters
the
saltonstalls
and
sewalls
of
old
times
in
gubernatorial
chairs
in
legislative
halls
around
winter
in
the
slow
martyrdoms
of
prison
and
hospital
the
great
struggle
through
which
we
have
passed
has
taught
us
how
much
we
owe
to
the
men
and
women
of
the
plymouth
colony
the
noblest
ancestry
that
ever
a
people
looked
back
to
with
love
and
reverence
honor
then
to
the

their
memory
be

governor
endicott
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
respond
in
person
to
the
invitation
of
the
essex
institute
to
its
commemorative
festival
on
the
i
especially
regret
it
because
though
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
and
as
such
regarding
with
abhorrence
the
severe
persecution
of
the
sect
under
the
administration
of
governor
endicott
i
am
not
unmindful
of
the
otherwise
noble
qualities
and
worthy
record
of
the
great
puritan
whose
misfortune
it
was
to
live
in
an
age
which
regarded
religious
toleration
as
a
crime
he
was
the
victim
of
the
merciless
logic
of
his
creed
he
honestly
thought
that
every
convert
to
quakerism
became
by
virtue
of
that
conversion
a
child
of
perdition
and
as
the
head
of
the
commonwealth
responsible
for
the
spiritual
as
well
as
temporal
welfare
of
its
inhabitants
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
whip
banish
and
hang
heretics
to
save
his
people
from
perilous
heresy
the
extravagance
of
some
of
the
early
quakers
has
been
grossly
exaggerated
their
conduct
will
compare
in
this
respect
favorably
with
that
of
the
first
anabaptists
and
independents
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
many
of
them
manifested
a
good
deal
of
that
wild
enthusiasm
which
has
always
been
the
result
of
persecution
and
the
denial
of
the
rights
of
conscience
and
worship
their
pertinacious
defiance
of
laws
enacted
against
them
and
their
fierce
denunciations
of
priests
and
magistrates
must
have
been
particularly
aggravating
to
a
man
as
proud
and
high
tempered
as
john
endicott
he
had
that
neighbor
of
his
edward
wharton
smartly
whipped
at
the
about
once
a
month
but
it
may
be
questioned
whether
the
governor
ears
did
not
suffer
as
much
under
wharton
biting
sarcasm
and
free
speech
as
the
latter
back
did
from
the
magisterial
whip
time
has
proved
that
the
quakers
had
the
best
of
the
controversy
and
their
descendants
can
well
afford
to
forget
and
forgive
an
error
which
the
puritan
governor
shared
with
the
generation
in
which
he
lived
west
ossipee
month
john
winthrop
on
the
anniversary
of
his
landing
at
salem
i
see
by
the
call
of
the
essex
institute
that
some
probability
is
suggested
that
i
may
furnish
a
poem
for
the
occasion
of
its
meeting
at
the
willows
on
the
i
would
be
glad
to
make
the
implied
probability
a
fact
but
i
find
it
difficult
to
put
my
thoughts
into
metrical
form
and
there
will
be
little
need
of
it
as
i
understand
a
lady
of
essex
county
who
adds
to
her
modern
culture
and
rare
poetical
gifts
the
best
spirit
of
her
puritan
ancestry
has
lent
the
interest
of
her
verse
to
the
occasion
it
was
a
happy
thought
of
the
institute
to
select
for
its
first
meeting
of
the
season
the
day
and
the
place
of
the
landing
of
the
great
and
good
governor
and
permit
me
to
say
as
thy
father
old
friend
that
its
choice
for
orator
of
the
son
of
him
whose
genius
statesmanship
and
eloquence
honored
the
place
of
his
birth
has
been
equally
happy
as
i
look
over
the
list
of
the
excellent
worthies
of
the
first
emigrations
i
find
no
one
who
in
all
respects
occupies
a
nobler
place
in
the
early
colonial
history
of
massachusetts
than
john
winthrop
like
vane
and
milton
he
was
a
gentleman
as
well
as
a
puritan
a
cultured
and
enlightened
statesman
as
well
as
a
christian
it
was
not
under
his
long
and
wise
chief
magistracy
that
religious
bigotry
and
intolerance
hung
and
tortured
their
victims
and
the
terrible
delusion
of
witchcraft
darkened
the
sun
at
noonday
over
essex
if
he
had
not
quite
reached
the
point
where
to
use
the
words
of
sir
thomas
more
he
could
hear
heresies
talked
and
yet
let
the
heretics
alone
he
was
in
charity
and
forbearance
far
in
advance
of
his
generation
i
am
sorry
that
i
must
miss
an
occasion
of
so
much
interest
i
hope
you
will
not
lack
the
presence
of
the
distinguished
citizen
who
inherits
the
best
qualities
of
his
honored
ancestor
and
who
as
a
statesman
scholar
and
patriot
has
added
new
lustre
to
the
name
