preface
the
remarks
made
in
the
preface
to
the
volume
on
american
founders
are
applicable
also
to
this
volume
on
american
leaders
the
lecture
on
daniel
webster
has
been
taken
from
its
original
position
in
warriors
and
statesmen
a
volume
the
lectures
of
which
are
now
distributed
for
the
new
edition
in
more
appropriate
groupings
and
finds
its
natural
neighborhood
in
this
volume
with
the
paper
on
clay
and
calhoun
since
the
intense
era
of
the
civil
war
has
passed
away
and
northerners
and
southerners
are
becoming
more
and
more
able
to
take
dispassionate
views
of
the
controversies
of
that
time
finding
honorable
reasons
for
the
differences
of
opinion
and
of
resultant
conduct
on
both
sides
it
has
been
thought
well
to
include
among
american
leaders
a
man
who
stands
before
all
americans
as
the
chief
embodiment
of
the
cause
for
which
so
many
gallant
soldiers
died
robert
lee
his
personal
character
was
so
lofty
his
military
genius
so
eminent
that
north
and
south
alike
looked
up
to
him
while
living
and
mourned
him
dead
his
career
is
depicted
by
one
who
has
given
it
careful
study
and
who
himself
a
wounded
veteran
officer
of
the
union
army
and
regarding
the
southern
cause
as
one
well
lost
as
to
its
chief
aims
of
secession
and
protection
to
slavery
in
the
interest
of
civilization
and
of
the
south
itself
yet
holds
a
high
appreciation
of
the
noble
man
who
is

personal
politics
it
is
very
seldom
that
a
man
arises
from
an
obscure
and
humble
position
to
an
exalted
without
peculiar
fitness
for
the
work
on
which
his
fame
rests
and
which
probably
no
one
else
could
have
done
so
well
he
may
not
be
learned
or
cultured
he
may
be
even
unlettered
and
rough
he
may
be
stained
by
vulgar
defects
and
vices
which
are
fatal
to
all
dignity
of
character
but
there
must
be
something
about
him
which
calls
out
the
respect
and
admiration
of
those
with
whom
he
is
surrounded
so
as
to
give
him
a
start
and
open
a
way
for
success
in
the
business
or
enterprise
where
his
genius
lies
such
a
man
was
andrew
jackson
whether
as
a
youth
or
as
a
man
pursuing
his
career
of
village
lawyer
in
the
backwoods
of
a
frontier
settlement
he
was
about
the
last
person
of
whom
one
would
predict
that
he
should
arise
to
a
great
position
and
unbounded
national
popularity
his
birth
was
plebeian
and
obscure
his
father
of
descent
lived
in
a
miserable
hamlet
in
north
carolina
near
the
south
carolina
line
without
owning
a
single
acre
of
land
one
of
the
poorest
of
the
poor
whites
the
boy
andrew
born
shortly
after
his
father
death
in
was
reared
in
poverty
and
almost
without
education
learning
at
school
only
to
read
write
and
cipher
nor
did
he
have
any
marked
desire
for
knowledge
and
never
could
spell
correctly
at
the
age
of
thirteen
he
was
driven
from
his
native
village
by
its
devastation
at
the
hands
of
the
english
soldiers
during
the
revolutionary
war
his
mother
a
worthy
and
most
woman
was
an
ardent
patriot
and
all
her
boys
hugh
robert
and
andrew
enlisted
in
the
local
the
elder
two
died
hugh
of
exposure
and
robert
of
prison
while
andrew
who
had
also
been
captured
and
sick
of
the
disease
survived
this
early
training
in
the
scenes
of
war
for
further
usefulness
the
mother
made
her
way
on
foot
to
charleston
to
nurse
the
sick
patriots
in
the
and
there
died
of
the
prison
fever
in
the
physical
endurance
and
force
of
character
of
this
mother
constituted
evidently
the
chief
legacy
that
andrew
inherited
and
it
served
him
well
through
a
long
and
arduous
life
at
fifteen
the
boy
was
a
homeless
orphan
a
sick
and
sorrowful
orphan
working
for
a
saddler
in
charleston
a
few
hours
of
the
day
as
his
health
would
permit
with
returning
strength
he
got
possession
of
a
horse
but
his
army
associates
had
led
him
into
evil
ways
and
he
became
indebted
to
his
landlord
for
board
this
he
managed
to
pay
only
by
staking
his
horse
in
a
game
of
dice
against
which
he
fortunately
won
and
this
squared
him
with
the
world
and
enabled
him
to
start
afresh
on
a
better
way
poor
and
obscure
as
he
was
and
imperfectly
educated
he
aspired
to
be
a
lawyer
and
at
eighteen
years
of
age
he
became
a
in
the
office
of
mr
spruce
mccay
in
salisbury
north
carolina
two
years
later
in
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar
not
making
much
headway
in
salisbury
he
wandered
to
that
part
of
the
state
which
is
now
tennessee
then
an
almost
unbroken
wilderness
exposed
to
indian
massacres
and
depredations
and
finally
he
located
himself
at
nashville
where
there
was
a
small
settlement
chiefly
of
adventurers
who
led
lives
of
license
and
idleness
it
seems
that
jackson
who
was
appointed
had
a
considerable
practice
in
his
profession
of
a
rough
sort
in
that
frontier
region
where
the
slightest
legal
knowledge
was
sufficient
for
success
he
was
in
no
sense
a
student
like
jefferson
and
madison
in
the
early
part
of
their
careers
in
virginia
as
village
lawyers
although
he
was
engaged
in
as
many
cases
and
had
perhaps
as
large
an
income
as
they
but
what
was
he
doing
all
this
while
when
he
was
not
in
his
and
in
the
sixteen
feet
square
was
he
pondering
the
principles
or
precedents
of
law
and
storing
his
mind
with
the
knowledge
gained
from
books
not
at
all
he
was
attending
and
and
all
the
sports
which
marked
the
southern
people
one
hundred
years
ago
and
his
associates
were
not
the
most
cultivated
and
wealthy
of
them
either
but
ignorant
rough
drinking
swearing
gambling
fighting
rowdies
whose
society
was
repulsive
to
people
of
taste
intelligence
and
virtue
the
young
lawyer
became
a
favorite
with
these
men
and
with
their
wives
and
sisters
and
daughters
he
could
ride
a
horse
better
than
any
of
his
neighbors
he
entered
into
their
quarrels
with
zeal
and
devotion
he
was
bold
rash
and
adventurous
ever
ready
to
hunt
a
hostile
indian
or
fight
a
duel
or
defend
an
innocent
man
who
had
suffered
injury
and
injustice
he
showed
himself
capable
of
the
warmest
and
most
devoted
friendship
as
well
as
the
bitterest
and
most
unrelenting
hatred
he
was
quick
to
join
a
dangerous
enterprise
and
ever
showing
ability
to
lead
it
the
first
on
the
spot
to
put
out
a
fire
the
first
to
expose
himself
in
a
common
danger
commanding
respect
for
his
honesty
sincerity
and
integrity
exciting
fear
from
his
fierce
wrath
when
insulted
a
man
terribly
in
earnest
always
as
courteous
and
chivalric
to
women
as
he
was
hard
and
savage
to
treacherous
men
above
all
he
was
now
a
man
of
commanding
stature
graceful
manners
dignified
deportment
and
a
naturally
distinguished
air
so
that
he
was
looked
up
to
by
men
and
admired
by
women
what
did
those
violent
quarrelsome
adventurous
settlers
on
the
western
confines
of
american
civilization
care
whether
their
favorite
was
learned
or
ignorant
so
long
as
he
was
manifestly
superior
to
them
in
their
chosen
pursuits
and
pleasures
was
capable
of
leading
them
in
any
enterprise
and
sympathized
with
them
in
all
their
ideas
and
prejudices
a
born
democrat
as
well
as
a
born
leader
his
claim
upon
them
however
was
not
without
its
worthy
elements
he
was
perfectly
fearless
in
enforcing
the
law
laughing
at
intimidation
he
often
had
to
ride
hundreds
of
miles
to
professional
duties
on
circuit
through
forests
infested
by
indians
and
towns
cowed
by
ruffians
and
he
and
his
rifle
were
held
in
great
respect
he
was
renowned
as
the
foremost
indian
fighter
in
that
country
and
as
a
prosecuting
attorney
whom
no
danger
and
no
temptation
could
swerve
from
his
duty
he
was
feared
trusted
and
boundlessly
popular
the
people
therefore
rallied
about
this
man
when
in
a
convention
was
called
for
framing
a
state
constitution
jackson
was
one
of
their
influential
delegates
and
in
december
of
that
year
he
was
sent
to
congress
as
their
most
popular
representative
of
course
he
was
totally
unfitted
for
legislative
business
in
which
he
never
could
have
made
any
mark
on
his
return
in
a
vacancy
occurring
in
the
united
states
senate
he
was
elected
senator
on
the
strength
of
his
popularity
as
representative
but
he
remained
only
a
year
at
philadelphia
finding
his
calling
dull
and
probably
conscious
that
he
had
no
fitness
for
legislation
while
the
opportunity
for
professional
and
pecuniary
success
in
tennessee
was
very
apparent
to
him
next
we
read
of
his
being
made
of
the
superior
court
of
tennessee
with
no
more
fitness
for
administering
the
law
than
he
had
for
making
it
or
interest
in
it
parton
tells
an
anecdote
of
jackson
at
this
time
which
whether
true
or
not
illustrates
his
character
as
well
as
the
rude
conditions
amid
which
he
made
himself
felt
he
was
holding
court
in
a
little
village
in
tennessee
when
a
great
hulking
fellow
armed
with
a
pistol
and
paraded
before
the
little
and
cursed
judge
jury
and
all
assembled
jackson
ordered
the
sheriff
to
arrest
him
but
that
functionary
failed
to
do
it
either
alone
or
with
a
posse
whereupon
jackson
caused
the
sheriff
to
summon
as
posse
adjourned
court
for
ten
minutes
walked
out
and
told
the
fellow
to
yield
or
be
shot
in
telling
why
he
surrendered
to
one
man
when
he
had
defied
a
crowd
the
ruffian
afterwards
said
when
he
came
up
i
looked
him
in
the
eye
and
i
saw
there
was
in
nary
other
eye
in
the
crowd
i
said
to
myself
it
is
about
time
to
sing
small
and
so
i
did
it
was
by
such
bold
fearless
conduct
that
jackson
won
admiration
not
by
his
law
of
which
he
knew
but
little
and
never
could
have
learned
much
the
law
moreover
was
uncongenial
to
this
man
of
action
and
he
resigned
his
judgeship
and
went
for
a
short
time
into
business
trading
land
selling
horses
groceries
and
when
he
was
appointed
of
militia
this
was
just
what
he
wanted
he
had
now
found
his
place
and
was
equal
to
it
his
habits
enterprises
dangers
and
bloody
encounters
all
alike
fitted
him
for
it
henceforth
his
duty
and
his
pleasure
ran
together
in
the
same
line
his
personal
peculiarities
had
made
him
popular
this
popularity
had
made
him
prominent
and
secured
to
him
offices
for
which
he
had
no
talent
seeing
which
he
dropped
them
but
when
a
situation
was
offered
for
which
he
was
fitted
he
soon
gained
distinction
and
his
true
career
began
it
was
as
an
indian
fighter
that
he
laid
the
foundation
of
his
fame
his
popularity
with
rough
people
was
succeeded
by
a
series
of
heroic
actions
which
brought
him
before
the
eyes
of
the
nation
there
was
no
sham
in
these
victories
he
fairly
earned
his
laurels
and
they
so
wrought
on
the
imagination
of
the
people
that
he
quickly
became
famous
but
before
his
military
exploits
brought
him
a
national
reputation
he
had
become
notorious
in
his
neighborhood
as
a
duellist
he
was
always
ready
to
fight
when
he
deemed
himself
insulted
his
numerous
duels
were
very
severely
commented
on
when
he
became
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
especially
in
new
england
but
duelling
was
a
peculiar
southern
institution
most
southern
people
settled
their
difficulties
with
pistols
some
of
jackson
duels
were
desperate
and
ferocious
he
was
the
best
shot
in
tennessee
and
it
is
said
could
lodge
two
successive
balls
in
the
same
hole
as
early
as
he
fought
with
a
fellow
lawyer
by
the
name
of
avery
in
he
killed
in
a
duel
charles
dickinson
who
had
spoken
disparagingly
of
his
wife
whom
he
had
lately
married
a
divorced
woman
but
to
whom
he
was
tenderly
attached
as
long
as
she
lived
still
later
he
fought
with
thomas
benton
and
received
a
wound
from
which
he
never
fully
recovered
such
was
the
life
of
jackson
until
he
was
years
of
age
that
of
a
violent
passionate
arbitrary
man
beloved
as
a
friend
and
feared
as
an
enemy
it
was
the
creek
war
and
the
war
with
england
which
developed
his
extraordinary
energies
when
the
war
of
broke
out
he
was
of
tennessee
militia
and
at
once
offered
his
services
to
the
government
which
were
eagerly
accepted
and
he
was
authorized
to
raise
a
body
of
volunteers
in
tennessee
and
to
report
with
them
at
new
orleans
he
found
no
difficulty
in
collecting
about
sixteen
hundred
men
and
in
january
took
them
down
the
cumberland
the
ohio
and
mississippi
to
natchez
in
such
boats
as
he
could
collect
another
body
of
mounted
men
crossed
the
country
five
hundred
miles
to
the
rendezvous
and
went
into
camp
at
natchez
the
southern
department
was
under
the
command
of
general
james
wilkinson
with
headquarters
at
new
orleans
a
disagreeable
and
contentious
man
who
did
not
like
jackson
through
his
influence
the
tennessee
detachment
after
two
months
delay
in
natchez
was
ordered
by
the
authorities
at
washington
to
be
dismissed
without
pay
five
hundred
miles
from
home
jackson
promptly
decided
not
to
obey
the
command
but
to
keep
his
forces
together
provide
at
his
own
expense
for
their
food
and
transportation
and
take
them
back
to
tennessee
in
good
order
he
accomplished
this
putting
sick
men
on
his
own
three
horses
and
himself
marching
on
foot
with
the
men
who
enthusiastic
over
his
elastic
toughness
dubbed
him
old
hickory
a
title
of
affection
that
is
familiar
to
this
day
the
government
afterwards
reimbursed
him
for
his
outlay
in
this
matter
but
his
generosity
energy
and
masterly
force
added
immensely
to
his
popularity
jackson
disobedience
of
orders
attracted
but
little
attention
at
washington
in
that
time
of
greater
events
while
his
own
patriotism
and
fighting
zeal
were
not
abated
by
his
failure
to
get
at
the
enemy
and
very
soon
his
desires
were
to
be
granted
in
before
the
war
with
england
was
declared
a
general
confederation
of
indians
had
been
made
under
the
influence
of
the
celebrated
tecumseh
a
chief
of
the
shawanoc
tribe
he
was
a
man
of
magnificent
figure
stately
and
noble
as
a
greek
warrior
and
withal
eloquent
with
his
twin
brother
the
prophet
tecumseh
travelled
from
the
great
lakes
in
the
north
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
inducing
tribe
after
tribe
to
unite
against
the
rapacious
and
advancing
whites
but
he
did
not
accomplish
much
until
the
war
with
england
broke
out
in
when
he
saw
a
possibility
of
realizing
his
grand
idea
and
by
the
summer
of
he
had
the
creek
nation
including
a
number
of
tribes
organized
for
war
how
far
he
was
aided
by
english
intrigues
is
not
fully
known
but
he
doubtless
received
encouragement
from
english
agents
from
the
british
and
the
spaniards
the
indians
received
arms
and
ammunition
the
first
attack
of
these
indians
was
on
august
at
fort
mims
in
alabama
where
there
were
nearly
two
hundred
american
troops
and
where
five
hundred
people
were
collected
for
safety
the
indians
chiefly
creeks
were
led
by
red
eagle
who
utterly
annihilated
the
defenders
of
the
fort
under
major
beasley
and
scalped
the
women
and
children
when
reports
of
this
unexpected
and
atrocious
massacre
reached
tennessee
the
whole
population
was
aroused
to
vengeance
and
general
jackson
his
arm
still
in
a
sling
from
his
duel
with
benton
set
out
to
punish
the
savage
foes
but
he
was
impeded
by
lack
of
provisions
and
quarrels
among
his
subordinates
and
general
insubordination
in
surmounting
his
difficulties
he
showed
extraordinary
tact
and
energy
his
measures
were
most
vigorous
he
did
not
hesitate
to
shoot
whether
legally
or
illegally
those
who
were
insubordinate
thus
restoring
military
discipline
the
first
and
last
necessity
in
war
soldiers
soon
learn
to
appreciate
the
worth
of
such
decision
and
follow
such
a
leader
with
determination
almost
equal
to
his
own
jackson
troops
did
splendid
marching
and
fighting
so
rapid
and
relentless
were
his
movements
against
the
enemy
that
the
campaign
lasted
but
seven
months
and
the
indians
were
nearly
all
killed
or
dispersed
i
need
not
enumerate
his
engagements
which
were
regarded
as
brilliant
his
early
dangers
and
adventures
and
his
acquaintance
with
indian
warfare
ever
since
he
could
handle
a
rifle
now
stood
him
in
good
stead
on
the
of
april
the
militia
under
his
command
returned
home
victorious
and
jackson
for
his
heroism
and
ability
was
made
a
in
the
regular
army
he
then
being
years
of
age
it
was
in
this
war
that
we
first
hear
of
the
famous
frontiersman
davy
crockett
and
of
sam
houston
afterwards
so
unique
a
figure
in
the
war
for
texan
independence
in
this
war
too
general
harrison
gained
his
success
at
tippecanoe
which
was
never
forgotten
but
his
military
genius
was
far
inferior
to
that
of
jackson
it
is
probable
that
had
jackson
been
sent
to
the
north
by
the
secretary
of
war
he
would
have
driven
the
british
troops
out
of
canada
there
is
no
question
about
his
military
ability
although
his
reputation
was
sullied
by
and
arbitrary
measures
what
he
saw
fit
to
do
he
did
without
scruples
or
regard
to
consequences
in
war
everything
is
tested
by
success
and
in
view
of
that
if
sufficiently
brilliant
everything
else
is
forgotten
the
successful
and
rapid
conquest
of
the
creeks
opened
the
way
for
jackson
southern
campaign
against
the
english
as
he
was
sent
to
conclude
a
treaty
with
the
indians
which
he
soon
arranged
and
was
then
put
in
command
of
the
southern
division
of
the
army
with
headquarters
at
mobile
the
english
made
the
neutral
spanish
territory
of
florida
a
basis
of
operations
along
the
shores
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
thus
putting
in
peril
both
mobile
and
new
orleans
they
virtually
possessed
pensacola
the
spanish
force
being
too
feeble
to
hold
it
and
made
it
the
rendezvous
of
their
fleets
the
spanish
authorities
made
a
show
indeed
of
friendship
with
the
united
states
but
the
english
flag
floated
over
the
forts
of
the
city
and
the
governor
was
in
sympathy
with
england
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
when
jackson
arrived
at
mobile
at
the
head
of
parts
of
three
regiments
of
regulars
with
a
thousand
miles
of
coast
to
defend
and
without
a
fort
adequately
armed
or
garrisoned
he
applied
to
the
secretary
of
war
for
permission
to
take
pensacola
but
the
government
hesitated
to
attack
a
friendly
power
without
further
knowledge
of
their
unfriendly
acts
and
the
delayed
response
ordering
caution
and
waiting
did
not
reach
him
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
asking
for
orders
and
getting
none
he
was
obliged
to
act
without
instructions
in
face
of
vastly
superior
forces
and
for
this
he
can
scarcely
be
blamed
since
his
situation
demanded
vigorous
and
rapid
measures
before
they
could
be
indorsed
by
the
secretary
of
war
pensacola
at
the
end
of
a
beautiful
bay
ten
miles
from
the
sea
with
a
fine
harbor
was
defended
by
fort
barrancas
six
miles
from
the
town
before
it
lay
eight
english
at
anchor
the
source
of
military
supplies
for
the
fort
on
which
floated
the
flags
of
both
england
and
spain
the
fleet
was
in
command
of
captain
lord
percy
whose
flagship
was
the
hermes
while
colonel
nichols
commanded
the
troops
this
latter
boastful
and
imprudent
officer
was
foolish
enough
to
issue
a
proclamation
to
the
inhabitants
of
louisiana
and
kentucky
to
take
up
arms
against
their
country
a
body
of
indians
were
also
drilled
in
the
service
of
the
british
so
far
as
indians
can
be
drilled
to
regular
warfare
as
soon
as
the
true
intentions
of
the
english
were
known
to
general
jackson
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
take
possession
of
pensacola
he
wrote
to
the
spanish
governor
a
pompous
inefficient
old
grandee
and
demanded
the
surrender
of
certain
hostile
creek
chieftains
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
town
the
demand
was
haughtily
rejected
jackson
waited
until
three
thousand
tennessee
militia
for
whom
he
had
urgently
sent
arrived
at
mobile
under
the
command
of
general
coffee
one
of
his
efficient
coadjutors
in
the
creek
war
and
colonel
butler
and
then
promptly
and
successfully
stormed
pensacola
driving
out
the
british
who
blew
up
fort
barrancas
and
escaped
to
their
ships
after
which
he
retired
to
mobile
to
defend
that
important
town
against
the
british
forces
who
threatened
an
attack
the
city
of
mobile
could
be
defended
by
fortifications
on
mobile
point
thirty
miles
distant
at
the
mouth
of
the
bay
since
opposite
it
was
a
narrow
channel
through
which
alone
vessels
of
any
considerable
size
could
enter
the
bay
at
this
point
was
fort
bowyer
in
a
state
of
dilapidation
mounting
but
a
few
pieces
of
cannon
into
this
fort
jackson
at
once
threw
a
garrison
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
regular
infantry
under
major
lawrence
a
most
gallant
officer
these
troops
were
of
course
unacquainted
with
the
use
of
artillery
but
they
put
the
fort
in
the
best
condition
they
could
and
on
the
of
september
the
enemy
appeared
the
fleet
under
captain
percy
and
a
body
of
marines
and
indians
under
colonel
nichols
jackson
then
at
mobile
apprised
of
the
appearance
of
the
british
hastily
reinforced
the
fort
about
to
be
attacked
by
a
large
force
confident
of
success
on
the
of
september
the
attack
began
the
english
battered
down
the
ramparts
of
the
fortifications
and
anchored
their
ships
within
of
the
fort
but
so
gallant
was
the
defence
that
the
ships
were
disabled
and
the
enemy
retreated
with
a
loss
of
about
one
hundred
men
this
victory
saved
mobile
and
more
it
gave
confidence
to
the
small
army
on
whom
the
defence
of
the
coast
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
depended
jackson
forthwith
issued
his
bulletins
or
proclamations
in
a
truly
napoleonic
style
to
the
inhabitants
of
louisiana
to
rally
to
the
defence
of
new
orleans
which
he
saw
would
probably
be
the
next
object
of
attack
on
the
part
of
the
british
on
the
of
december
he
personally
reached
that
city
and
made
preparations
for
the
expected
assault
and
ably
assisted
by
edward
livingston
the
most
prominent
lawyer
of
the
city
enlisted
for
the
defence
the
french
creoles
the
american
residents
and
a
few
spaniards
new
orleans
was
a
prize
which
the
english
coveted
and
to
possess
it
that
government
had
willingly
expended
a
million
of
pounds
sterling
the
city
not
only
controlled
the
commerce
of
the
mississippi
but
in
it
were
stored
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
bales
of
cotton
and
eight
hundred
and
ten
thousand
hogsheads
of
sugar
all
of
which
the
english
government
expected
to
seize
it
contained
at
that
time
about
twenty
thousand
people
less
than
half
of
whom
were
whites
and
these
chiefly
french
creoles
besides
a
floating
population
of
sailors
and
traders
new
orleans
is
built
on
a
bend
in
the
mississippi
in
the
shape
of
a
about
one
hundred
miles
from
where
by
a
sinuous
southeasterly
course
the
river
empties
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
at
the
city
the
river
was
about
a
mile
wide
with
a
current
of
four
miles
an
hour
and
back
of
the
town
was
a
swamp
draining
to
the
north
into
lake
ponchartrain
and
to
the
east
into
lake
borgne
which
opens
out
into
the
gulf
east
of
the
city
it
was
difficult
for
at
that
time
to
ascend
the
river
one
hundred
miles
against
the
current
if
forts
and
batteries
were
erected
on
its
banks
and
a
sort
of
back
entrance
was
afforded
to
the
city
for
small
vessels
through
lakes
and
lagoons
at
a
comparatively
short
distance
on
one
of
these
lakes
lake
borgne
a
flotilla
of
light
gunboats
was
placed
for
defence
under
the
command
of
lieutenant
jones
but
on
december
an
overpowering
force
of
small
british
vessels
dispersed
the
american
squadron
and
on
the
about
fifteen
hundred
regulars
the
picked
men
of
the
british
army
fresh
from
european
victories
under
wellington
contrived
to
find
their
way
unperceived
through
the
swamps
and
lagoons
to
the
belt
of
plantations
between
the
river
and
the
swamps
about
nine
miles
below
new
orleans
when
the
news
arrived
of
the
loss
of
the
gunboats
which
made
the
enemy
the
masters
of
lake
borgne
a
panic
spread
over
the
city
for
the
forces
of
the
enemy
were
greatly
exaggerated
but
jackson
was
equal
to
the
emergency
though
having
but
just
arrived
he
coolly
adopted
the
most
vigorous
measures
and
restored
confidence
times
of
confusion
difficulty
and
danger
were
always
his
best
opportunities
he
proclaimed
martial
law
he
sent
in
all
directions
for
reinforcements
he
called
upon
the
people
to
organize
for
defence
he
released
and
enlisted
the
convicts
and
accepted
the
proffered
services
of
jean
lafitte
the
pirate
or
rather
smuggler
of
the
gulf
with
two
companies
of
his
he
appealed
to
the
generous
free
men
of
color
to
enlist
and
the
whole
town
was
instantly
transformed
into
a
military
camp
within
a
fortnight
he
had
five
thousand
men
regulars
and
the
rest
militia
general
jackson
address
to
his
soldiers
was
spirited
but
inflated
encouraging
and
boastful
with
a
great
patriotic
ring
and
of
course
effective
the
population
of
the
city
was
united
in
resolving
to
make
a
sturdy
defence
had
the
british
marched
as
soon
as
they
landed
they
probably
would
have
taken
the
city
in
the
existing
consternation
but
they
waited
for
larger
forces
from
their
ships
which
carried
six
thousand
troops
and
in
their
turn
exaggerated
the
number
of
the
defenders
which
at
the
first
were
only
about
two
thousand
badly
frightened
men
the
delay
was
a
godsend
to
the
americans
who
now
learned
the
strength
of
the
enemy
on
the
as
always
eager
to
be
at
his
enemy
and
moving
with
his
characteristic
energy
jackson
sent
a
small
force
down
to
make
a
night
attack
on
the
british
camp
also
a
schooner
heavily
armed
with
cannon
to
from
the
river
it
was
a
wild
and
inconsequent
fight
but
it
checked
the
advance
of
the
british
who
now
were
still
more
impressed
with
the
need
of
reinforcements
it
aroused
the
confidence
and
fighting
spirit
of
the
americans
and
it
enabled
jackson
to
take
up
a
defensive
line
behind
an
old
canal
extending
across
the
plain
from
river
to
swamp
and
gave
him
time
to
fortify
it
at
once
he
raised
a
formidable
barricade
of
mud
and
timber
and
strengthened
it
with
from
the
neighboring
plantations
the
cotton
however
proved
rather
a
nuisance
than
a
help
as
it
took
fire
under
the
attack
and
smoked
annoying
the
men
the
fortifications
of
were
only
a
romance
of
the
war
on
the
arrived
sir
edward
pakenham
of
wellington
and
an
able
soldier
to
take
command
and
on
the
the
british
attacked
the
extemporized
but
strong
breastworks
confident
of
success
but
the
from
the
backwoods
of
tennessee
under
carroll
and
from
kentucky
under
coffee
who
fought
with
every
advantage
protected
by
their
mud
defences
were
equally
confident
the
slaughter
of
the
british
troops
utterly
unprotected
though
brave
and
gallant
was
terrible
and
they
were
repulsed
preparations
were
now
made
for
a
still
more
vigorous
systematic
and
general
assault
and
a
force
was
sent
across
the
river
to
menace
the
city
from
that
side
on
the
of
january
the
decisive
battle
was
fought
which
extinguished
forever
all
dreams
of
the
conquest
of
america
on
the
part
of
the
british
general
pakenham
who
commanded
the
advancing
columns
in
person
was
killed
and
their
authorities
state
their
loss
to
have
been
two
thousand
killed
wounded
and
missing
the
american
loss
was
eight
killed
and
thirteen
wounded
it
was
a
rash
presumption
for
the
british
to
attack
a
fortified
entrenchment
ten
feet
high
in
some
places
and
ten
feet
thick
with
detached
redoubts
to
flank
it
and
three
thousand
men
behind
it
the
conflict
was
not
strictly
a
battle
not
like
an
encounter
in
the
open
field
where
the
raw
troops
under
jackson
most
of
them
militia
would
have
stood
no
chance
with
the
veterans
whom
wellington
had
led
to
victory
and
glory
jackson
brilliant
defence
at
new
orleans
was
admirably
planned
and
energetically
executed
it
had
no
effect
on
the
war
for
the
treaty
of
peace
although
not
yet
heard
of
had
been
signed
weeks
before
but
it
enabled
america
to
close
the
conflict
with
a
splendid
success
which
offset
the
disasters
and
mistakes
of
the
northern
campaigns
naturally
it
was
magnified
into
a
great
military
exploit
and
raised
the
fame
of
jackson
to
such
a
height
all
over
the
country
that
nothing
could
ever
afterwards
weaken
his
popularity
no
matter
what
he
did
lawful
or
unlawful
he
was
a
victor
over
the
indians
and
over
the
english
and
all
his
arbitrary
acts
were
condoned
by
an
admiring
people
who
had
but
few
military
heroes
to
boast
of
his
successes
had
a
bad
effect
on
jackson
himself
he
came
to
feel
that
he
had
a
right
to
ride
over
precedents
and
law
when
it
seemed
to
him
expedient
he
set
up
his
will
against
constituted
authorities
and
everybody
who
did
not
endorse
his
measures
he
regarded
as
a
personal
enemy
to
be
crushed
if
possible
it
was
never
said
of
him
that
he
was
unpatriotic
in
his
intentions
only
that
he
was
wilful
vindictive
and
ignorant
from
the
of
january
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
was
the
most
popular
man
that
this
country
ever
saw
excepting
perhaps
washington
and
lincoln
the
central
figure
in
american
politics
with
prodigious
influence
even
after
he
had
finally
retired
from
public
life
immediately
after
the
defence
of
new
orleans
the
legislatures
of
different
states
and
congress
itself
passed
grateful
resolutions
for
his
military
services
and
the
nation
heaped
all
the
honor
on
the
hero
that
was
in
its
power
to
give
medals
swords
and
rewards
and
congress
remitted
a
fine
which
had
been
imposed
by
judge
hall
in
new
orleans
for
contempt
of
court
jackson
severity
in
executing
six
for
mutiny
was
approved
generally
as
a
wholesome
exercise
of
military
discipline
and
all
his
acts
were
glorified
wherever
he
went
there
was
a
round
of
festivities
he
began
to
be
talked
about
as
soon
as
the
war
was
closed
as
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
although
when
the
idea
was
first
proposed
to
him
he
repelled
it
with
genuine
indignation
scarcely
had
the
british
troops
been
withdrawn
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
fight
more
successfully
at
waterloo
when
jackson
was
called
to
put
an
end
to
the
seminole
war
in
florida
which
spanish
territory
he
occupied
on
the
ground
of
the
indians
seminoles
and
creeks
with
many
runaway
negroes
had
been
pillaging
the
border
of
georgia
jackson
drove
them
off
seized
the
spanish
fort
on
appalachee
bay
and
again
took
possession
of
pensacola
on
the
plea
that
the
spanish
officials
were
aiding
the
indians
it
required
all
the
skill
of
the
government
at
washington
to
defend
his
despotic
acts
for
he
was
as
complete
an
autocrat
in
his
limited
sphere
as
caesar
or
napoleon
the
only
limits
he
regarded
were
the
limits
to
his
power
but
in
whatever
he
did
he
had
a
firm
conviction
that
he
was
right
even
john
quincy
adams
justified
his
acts
in
florida
when
his
enemies
were
loud
in
their
complaints
of
his
needless
executions
especially
of
two
british
traders
arbuthnot
and
ambruter
whom
he
had
and
shot
as
abettors
of
the
indians
he
had
invaded
the
territory
of
a
neutral
power
and
driven
off
its
representatives
but
everything
was
condoned
and
when
shortly
after
florida
became
united
states
territory
by
purchase
from
spain
he
was
made
its
first
governor
a
new
field
for
him
but
an
appointment
which
president
monroe
felt
it
necessary
to
make
in
april
having
resigned
his
commission
in
the
army
jackson
left
nashville
with
his
family
to
take
up
his
residence
in
pensacola
enchanted
with
its
climate
and
fruits
and
flowers
its
refreshing
and
its
beautiful
situation
in
spite
of
hot
weather
as
governor
of
florida
he
was
invested
with
extraordinary
powers
indeed
there
was
scarcely
any
limit
to
them
except
that
he
had
no
power
to
levy
and
collect
taxes
and
seize
the
property
of
the
mixed
races
who
dwelt
in
the
land
of
oranges
and
flowers
it
would
appear
that
aside
from
arbitrary
acts
he
did
all
he
could
for
the
good
of
the
territory
under
the
influence
of
his
wife
a
christian
woman
whom
he
indulged
in
all
things
especially
in
shutting
up
putting
a
stop
to
and
securing
an
outward
respect
for
the
sabbath
his
term
of
office
however
was
brief
and
as
his
health
was
poor
for
he
was
never
vigorous
in
november
of
the
same
year
he
gladly
returned
to
nashville
and
about
this
time
built
his
residence
the
hermitage
as
a
farmer
he
was
unusually
successful
making
agriculture
lucrative
even
with
jackson
had
now
become
a
prominent
candidate
for
the
presidency
and
as
a
part
of
the
political
plan
he
was
in
made
senator
from
tennessee
in
congress
where
he
served
parts
of
two
terms
without
however
distinguishing
himself
as
a
legislator
he
made
but
few
speeches
and
these
were
short
but
cast
his
vote
on
occasions
of
importance
voting
against
a
reduction
of
duty
on
iron
and
woollen
and
cotton
goods
against
imprisonment
for
debt
and
favoring
some
internal
improvements
in
he
wrote
a
letter
advocating
a
careful
tariff
so
far
as
it
should
afford
revenues
for
the
national
defence
and
to
pay
off
the
national
debt
and
give
a
proper
distribution
of
our
labor
but
a
tariff
to
enrich
capitalists
at
the
expense
of
the
laboring
classes
he
always
abhorred
the
administration
of
james
monroe
in
two
full
terms
from
to
had
not
been
marked
by
any
great
events
or
popular
movements
of
especial
historical
interest
it
was
the
era
of
good
feeling
the
times
were
placid
and
party
animosities
had
nearly
subsided
the
opening
of
the
slavery
discussions
resulted
in
the
missouri
compromise
of
and
the
irritations
of
that
great
topic
were
allayed
for
the
time
like
all
his
predecessors
after
washington
monroe
had
been
successively
a
diplomatist
and
secretary
of
state
and
the
presidency
seemed
to
fall
to
him
as
a
matter
of
course
he
was
a
most
respectable
man
although
not
of
commanding
abilities
and
discharged
his
duties
creditably
in
the
absence
of
exciting
questions
the
only
event
of
his
administration
which
had
a
marked
influence
on
the
destinies
of
the
united
states
was
the
announcement
that
the
future
colonization
of
the
country
by
any
european
state
would
not
be
permitted
this
is
called
the
monroe
doctrine
and
had
the
warm
support
of
webster
and
other
leading
statesmen
it
not
only
proclaimed
the
idea
of
complete
american
independence
of
all
foreign
powers
but
opposed
all
interference
of
european
states
in
american
affairs
the
ultimate
influence
of
the
application
of
this
doctrine
can
not
be
exaggerated
in
importance
whether
it
originated
with
the
president
or
not
monroe
was
educated
for
the
bar
but
was
neither
a
good
speaker
nor
a
ready
writer
nor
was
he
a
man
of
extensive
culture
or
attainments
the
one
great
idea
attributed
to
him
was
america
for
the
americans
he
was
succeeded
however
by
a
man
of
fine
attainments
and
large
experience
who
had
passed
through
the
great
offices
of
state
with
distinguished
credit
in
february
jackson
was
almost
unanimously
nominated
for
the
presidency
by
the
democratic
party
through
the
convention
in
harrisburg
and
john
calhoun
was
nominated
for
the
jackson
main
rivals
in
the
election
which
followed
were
john
quincy
adams
and
henry
clay
both
of
whom
had
rendered
great
civil
services
and
were
better
fitted
for
the
post
but
jackson
was
the
most
popular
and
he
obtained
electoral
votes
adams
and
clay
no
one
having
a
majority
the
election
was
thrown
into
the
house
of
representatives
clay
who
never
liked
nor
trusted
jackson
threw
his
influence
in
favor
of
adams
and
adams
was
elected
by
the
vote
of
thirteen
states
jackson
and
his
friends
always
maintained
that
he
was
cheated
out
of
the
election
that
adams
and
clay
made
a
bargain
between
themselves
which
seemed
to
be
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
clay
was
made
secretary
of
state
in
adams
cabinet
although
this
was
a
natural
enough
sequence
of
clay
throwing
his
political
strength
to
make
adams
president
jackson
returned
wrathful
and
disappointed
to
his
farm
but
amid
boisterous
demonstrations
of
respect
wherever
he
went
if
he
had
not
cared
much
about
the
presidency
before
he
was
now
determined
to
achieve
it
and
to
crush
his
opponents
whom
he
promptly
regarded
as
enemies
john
quincy
adams
entered
upon
office
in
free
from
personal
obligations
and
partisan
entanglements
but
with
an
unfriendly
congress
this
however
was
not
of
much
consequence
since
no
great
subjects
were
before
congress
for
discussion
it
was
a
period
of
great
tranquillity
fitted
for
the
development
of
the
peaceful
arts
and
of
internal
improvements
in
the
land
rather
than
of
genius
in
the
presidential
chair
not
one
public
event
of
great
importance
occurred
although
many
commercial
treaties
were
signed
and
some
internal
improvements
were
made
adams
lived
in
friendly
relations
with
his
cabinet
composed
of
able
men
and
he
was
generally
respected
for
the
simplicity
of
his
life
and
the
conscientious
discharge
of
his
routine
duties
he
was
industrious
and
painstaking
rising
early
in
the
morning
and
retiring
early
in
the
evening
he
was
not
popular
being
cold
and
austere
in
manner
but
he
had
a
lofty
disdaining
to
conciliate
foes
or
reward
friends
a
new
england
puritan
of
the
severest
type
sternly
incorruptible
learned
without
genius
eloquent
without
rhetoric
experienced
without
wisdom
religious
without
orthodoxy
and
with
strong
prejudices
perhaps
the
most
marked
thing
in
the
political
history
of
that
administration
was
the
strife
for
the
next
presidency
and
the
beginning
of
that
angry
and
bitter
conflict
between
politicians
which
had
no
cessation
until
the
civil
war
the
sessions
of
congress
were
occupied
in
the
manufacture
of
political
capital
for
a
cloud
had
arisen
in
the
political
heavens
portending
storms
and
animosities
and
the
discussion
of
important
subjects
of
national
scope
such
as
had
not
agitated
the
country
before
pertaining
to
finances
to
tariffs
to
constitutional
limitations
to
retrenchments
and
innovations
there
arose
new
political
parties
or
rather
a
great
movement
extending
to
every
town
and
hamlet
to
give
a
new
impetus
to
the
democratic
sway
the
leaders
in
this
movement
were
the
great
antagonists
of
clay
and
webster
a
new
class
of
politicians
like
benton
amos
kendall
martin
van
buren
duff
green
lewis
and
others
a
new
era
of
politics
was
inaugurated
with
all
the
then
novel
but
now
customary
machinery
of
local
clubs
partisan
campaign
newspapers
and
the
organized
use
of
pledges
and
promises
of
appointments
to
office
to
reward
workers
this
system
had
been
efficiently
perfected
in
new
york
state
under
van
buren
and
other
leaders
but
now
it
was
brought
into
federal
politics
and
the
whole
country
was
stirred
into
a
fever
heat
of
party
strife
in
a
political
storm
therefore
jackson
was
elected
and
commenced
his
memorable
reign
in
john
quincy
adams
retiring
to
his
farm
in
disgust
and
wrath
the
new
president
was
carried
into
office
on
an
avalanche
of
democratic
voters
receiving
two
hundred
and
electoral
votes
while
adams
had
only
notwithstanding
his
long
public
services
and
his
acknowledged
worth
this
was
too
great
a
disappointment
for
the
retiring
statesman
to
bear
complacently
or
even
philosophically
he
gave
vent
to
his
irritated
feelings
in
unbecoming
language
exaggerating
the
ignorance
of
jackson
and
his
general
unfitness
for
the
high
office
in
this
however
betraying
an
estimate
of
the
incoming
president
which
was
common
among
educated
and
conservative
men
i
well
remember
at
college
the
contempt
which
the
president
and
all
the
professors
had
for
the
western
warrior
it
was
generally
believed
by
literary
men
that
old
hickory
could
scarcely
write
his
name
but
the
speeches
of
jackson
were
always
to
the
point
if
not
studied
and
elaborate
while
his
messages
were
certainly
respectable
though
rather
too
long
it
is
generally
supposed
that
he
furnished
the
rough
drafts
to
his
few
intimate
friends
who
recast
and
polished
them
while
some
think
that
william
lewis
amos
kendall
and
others
wrote
the
whole
of
them
as
well
as
all
his
public
papers
in
reading
the
early
letters
of
jackson
however
it
is
clear
that
they
are
anything
but
illiterate
whatever
mistakes
in
spelling
and
grammatical
errors
there
may
be
his
ideas
were
distinct
his
sentiments
unmistakable
and
although
he
was
fond
of
a
kind
of
eloquence
his
views
on
public
questions
were
generally
just
and
vigorously
expressed
a
tennessee
general
brought
up
with
gamblers
and
and
who
never
had
even
a
fair
education
could
not
be
expected
to
be
very
accomplished
in
the
arts
of
composition
whatever
talents
and
good
sense
he
naturally
may
have
had
certain
it
is
that
jackson
mind
was
clear
and
his
convictions
were
strong
upon
the
national
policy
to
be
pursued
by
him
and
if
he
opposed
banks
and
tariffs
it
was
because
he
believed
that
their
influence
was
hostile
to
the
true
interests
of
the
country
he
doubtless
well
understood
the
issues
of
great
public
questions
only
his
view
of
them
was
contrary
to
the
views
of
moneyed
men
and
bankers
and
the
educated
classes
of
his
day
generally
it
is
to
be
remarked
however
that
the
views
he
took
on
questions
of
political
economy
are
now
endorsed
by
many
able
college
professors
and
some
american
manufacturers
who
are
leading
public
opinion
in
opposition
to
tariffs
for
protection
and
in
the
direction
of
free
trade
the
first
thing
for
jackson
to
do
after
his
inauguration
was
to
select
his
cabinet
it
was
not
a
strong
one
he
wanted
clerks
not
advisers
he
was
to
himself
he
rarely
held
a
cabinet
meeting
in
a
very
short
time
this
cabinet
was
dissolved
by
a
scandal
general
eaton
secretary
of
war
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
who
was
remarkable
for
her
wit
and
social
brilliancy
the
aristocratic
wives
of
the
cabinet
ministers
would
not
associate
with
her
and
the
president
took
the
side
of
the
neglected
woman
in
accordance
with
his
chivalric
nature
his
error
was
in
attempting
to
force
his
cabinet
to
accord
to
her
a
social
position
a
matter
which
naturally
belonged
to
women
to
settle
so
bitter
was
the
quarrel
and
so
persistent
was
the
president
in
attempting
to
produce
harmony
in
his
cabinet
on
a
mere
social
question
that
the
ministers
resigned
rather
than
fight
so
obstinate
and
irascible
a
man
as
jackson
in
a
matter
which
was
outside
his
proper
sphere
of
action
the
new
cabinet
was
both
more
able
and
more
subservient
edward
livingston
of
louisiana
who
wrote
most
of
jackson
documents
when
he
commanded

was
made

secretary
of

roger
taney
of
maryland
all
distinguished
for
abilities
but
even
these
able
men
were
seldom
summoned
to
a
cabinet
meeting
the
confidential
advisers
of
the
president
were
amos
kendall
afterwards
duff
green
a
democratic
editor
isaac
hill
a
violent
partisan
who
edited
a
paper
in

and
was
made
second
auditor
of
the
treasury
and
william
lewis
an
old
friend
of
the
general
in
tennessee
all
able
men
but
unscrupulous
politicians
who
enjoyed
power
rather
than
the
display
of
it
these
advisers
became
known
in
the
party
contests
of
the
time
as
the
president
kitchen
cabinet
jackson
had
not
been
long
inaugurated
before
the
influence
of
the
kitchen
cabinet
was
seen
and
felt
for
it
was
probably
through
the
influence
of
these
men
that
the
president
brought
about
a
marked
change
in
the
policy
of
the
government
and
it
is
this
change
which
made
jackson
administration
so
memorable
it
was
the
intrusion
of
personality
instead
of
public
policy
into
the
management
of
party
politics
madison
did
not
depart
from
the
general
policy
of
jefferson
nor
did
monroe
the
virginia
dynasty
kept
up
the
traditions
of
the
government
as
originally
constituted
but
jackson
cut
loose
from
all
traditions
and
precedents
especially
in
the
matter
of
assuming
responsibilities
and
attempted
to
carry
on
the
government
independently
of
congress
in
many
important
respects
it
is
the
duty
of
the
president
to
execute
the
laws
as
he
finds
them
until
repealed
or
altered
by
the
national
legislature
but
it
was
the
disposition
of
jackson
to
disregard
those
laws
which
he
disapproved
an
encroachment
hard
to
be
distinguished
from
usurpation
and
this
is
the
most
serious
charge
against
him
as
president
not
his
ignorance
but
his
despotic
temper
and
his
in
supposing
himself
wiser
than
the
collected
wisdom
and
experience
of
the
representatives
of
the
nation
a
notion
which
neither
washington
nor
jefferson
nor
madison
ever
entertained
again
jackson
system
of
appointments
to
office
the
removal
of
men
already
satisfactorily
doing
the
work
of
the
government
in
order
to
make
places
for
his
personal
and
political
supporters
was
a
great
innovation
against
all
the
experience
of
governments
whether
despotic
or
constitutional
it
led
to
the
reign
of
demagogues
and
gave
rewards
not
to
those
who
deserved
promotion
from
their
able
and
conscientious
discharge
of
duty
in
public
trusts
but
to
those
who
most
unscrupulously
and
zealously
advocated
or
advanced
the
interests
of
the
party
in
power
it
led
to
perpetual
rotations
in
office
without
reasonable
cause
and
made
the
election
of
party
chiefs
of
more
importance
than
the
support
of
right
principles
the
imperfect
civil
service
reforms
which
have
been
secured
during
the
last
few
years
with
so
much
difficulty
show
the
political
mischief
for
which
jackson
is
responsible
and
which
has
disgraced
every
succeeding
administration
an
evil
so
gigantic
that
no
president
has
been
strong
enough
to
overcome
it
not
only
injurious
to
the
welfare
of
the
nation
by
depriving
it
of
the
services
of
experienced
men
but
inflicting
an
onerous
load
on
the
president
himself
which
he
finds
it
impossible
to
shake
off
the
great
obstacle
to
the
proper
discharge
of
his
own
public
duties
and
the
bar
to
all
private
enjoyment
what
is
more
perplexing
and
irritating
to
an
incoming
president
than
the
persistent
and
unreasonable
demands
of
nine
out
of
ten
of
whom
are
doomed
to
disappointment
and
who
consequently
become
enemies
rather
than
friends
of
the
administration
this
spoils
system
which
jackson
inaugurated
has
proved
fatal
to
all
dignity
of
office
and
all
honesty
in
elections
it
has
divested
politics
of
all
attraction
to
superior
men
and
put
government
largely
into
the
hands
of
the
most
venal
and
unblushing
of
demagogues
it
has
proved
as
great
and
fatal
a
mistake
as
has
the
establishment
of
universal
suffrage
which
jefferson
encouraged
a
mistake
at
least
in
the
great
cities
of
the
country
an
evil
which
can
never
be
remedied
except
by
revolution
doubtless
it
was
a
generous
impulse
on
the
part
of
jackson
to
reward
his
friends
with
the
spoils
of
office
as
it
was
a
logical
sequence
of
the
doctrine
of
political
equality
to
give
every
man
a
vote
whether
virtuous
or
wicked
intelligent
or
ignorant
until
jackson
was
intrusted
with
the
reins
of
government
no
president
of
the
united
states
however
inclined
to
reward
political
friends
dared
to
establish
such
a
principle
as
rotation
in
office
or
removal
without
sufficient
cause
not
one
there
was
who
would
not
have
shrunk
from
such
a
dangerous
precedent
a
policy
certain
to
produce
an
inferior
class
of
public
servants
and
take
away
from
political
life
all
that
is
lofty
and
ennobling
except
in
positions
entirely
independent
of
presidential
control
such
as
the
national
legislature
the
senate
especially
during
jackson
administration
was
composed
of
remarkably
gifted
men
the
most
distinguished
of
whom
opposed
and
detested
the
measures
and
policy
he
pursued
with
such
unbending
obstinacy
that
he
was
filled
with
bitterness
and
wrath
this
feeling
was
especially
manifested
towards
clay
webster
and
calhoun
the
great
lights
of
the
senate
chamber
although
jackson
party
had
the
majority
of
both
houses
much
of
the
time
and
thus
while
often
hindered
he
was
in
the
end
unchecked
in
his
innovations
and
hostilities
but
these
three
giants
he
had
to
fight
during
most
of
his
presidential
career
which
kept
him
in
a
state
of
perpetual
irritation
their
opposition
was
to
him
a
bitter
pill
they
were
beyond
his
power
as
independent
as
he
until
then
in
his
military
and
gubernatorial
capacity
his
will
had
been
supreme
he
had
no
opponents
whom
he
could
not
crush
he
was
accustomed
to
rule
despotically
as
president
he
could
be
defied
and
restrained
by
congress
his
measures
had
to
be
of
the
nature
of
recommendation
except
in
the
power
of
veto
which
he
did
not
hesitate
to
use
unsparingly
but
the
senate
could
refuse
to
ratify
his
appointments
and
often
did
refuse
which
drove
him
beyond
the
verge
of
swearing
again
in
the
great
questions
which
came
up
for
discussion
especially
those
in
the
domain
of
political
economy
there
would
be
honest
differences
of
opinion
for
political
economy
has
settled
very
little
and
is
not
therefore
strictly
a
science
any
more
than
medicine
is
it
is
a
system
of
theories
based
on
imperfect
inductions
there
can
be
no
science
except
what
is
based
on
facts
or
accepted
principles
there
are
no
incontrovertible
doctrines
pertaining
to
tariffs
or
financial
operations
which
are
modified
by
circumstances
the
three
great
things
which
most
signally
marked
the
administration
of
jackson
were
the
debates
on
the
tariffs
the
quarrel
with
the
united
states
bank
and
the
nullification
theories
of
calhoun
it
would
seem
that
jackson
when
inaugurated
was
in
favor
of
a
moderate
tariff
to
aid
military
operations
and
to
raise
the
necessary
revenue
for
federal
expenses
but
was
opposed
to
high
protective
duties
even
in
he
waived
many
of
his
scruples
as
to
internal
improvements
in
deference
to
public
opinion
and
signed
the
bills
which
made
appropriations
for
the
improvement
of
harbors
and
rivers
for
the
continuation
of
the
cumberland
road
for
the
encouragement
of
the
culture
of
the
vine
and
olive
and
for
granting
an
extended
copyright
to
authors
it
was
only
during
his
second
term
that
his
hostility
to
tariffs
became
a
passion
not
from
any
views
of
political
economy
for
which
he
had
no
adequate
intellectual
training
but
because
protection
was
unpopular
in
the
southwestern
states
and
because
he
instinctively
felt
that
it
favored
monopolists
at
the
expense
of
the
people
what
he
hated
most
intensely
were
capitalists
and
moneyed
institutions
like
jefferson
he
feared
their
influence
on
elections
as
he
was
probably
conscious
of
his
inability
to
grasp
the
complex
questions
of
political
economy
he
was
not
bitter
in
his
opposition
to
tariffs
except
on
political
grounds
hence
generally
speaking
he
left
congress
to
discuss
that
theme
we
shall
have
occasion
to
look
into
it
in
the
lecture
on
henry
clay
and
here
only
mention
the
great
debates
of
jackson
time
on
the
subject
a
subject
on
which
congress
has
been
debating
for
fifty
years
and
will
probably
be
debating
for
fifty
years
to
come
since
the
whole
matter
depends
practically
on
changing
circumstances
whatever
may
be
the
abstract
theories
of
doctrinaires
while
jackson
then
on
the
whole
left
tariffs
to
congress
he
was
not
so
discreet
in
matters
of
finance
his
war
with
the
united
states
bank
was
an
important
episode
in
his
life
and
the
chief
cause
of
the
enmity
with
which
the
moneyed
and
conservative
classes
pursued
him
to
the
end
of
his
days
had
he
let
the
bank
alone
he
would
have
been
freed
from
most
of
the
vexations
and
turmoils
which
marked
his
administration
he
would
have
left
a
brighter
name
he
would
not
have
given
occasion
for
those
assaults
which
met
him
on
every
hand
and
which
history
justifies
he
might
even
have
been
forgiven
for
his
spoils
system
and
unprecedented
removals
from
office
in
attacking
the
bank
he
laid
a
profane
touch
upon
a
sacred
ark
and
handled
untempered
mortar
he
stopped
the
which
regulated
the
finances
of
the
country
and
introduced
no
end
of
commercial
disorders
ending
in
dire
disasters
like
the
tariff
finances
were
a
question
with
which
he
was
not
competent
to
deal
his
fault
was
something
more
than
the
veto
on
the
recharter
of
the
bank
by
congress
which
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
make
it
was
a
vindictive
assault
on
an
important
institution
before
its
charter
had
expired
even
in
his
first
message
to
congress
in
this
warfare
we
see
unscrupulous
violence
prompted
not
alone
by
his
firm
hostility
to
everything
which
looked
like
a
monopoly
and
a
moneyed
power
but
by
the
influence
of
advisers
who
hated
everything
like
inequality
of
position
especially
when
not
usable
for
their
own
purposes
they
stimulated
his
jealousy
and
resentments
they
played
on
his
passions
and
prejudices
they
flattered
him
as
if
he
were
the
monarch
of
the
universe
incapable
of
a
wrong
judgment
hostility
to
the
however
is
older
than
the
public
life
of
jackson
it
existed
among
the
american
democracy
as
early
as
the
time
of
alexander
hamilton
when
he
founded
the
first
bank
of
the
united
states
he
met
with
great
opposition
from
the
followers
of
jefferson
who
were
jealous
of
the
power
it
was
supposed
to
wield
in
politics
when
in
the
question
came
up
of
renewing
the
charter
of
the
first
united
states
bank
the
were
bitter
in
their
opposition
and
so
effective
was
the
outcry
that
the
bank
went
into
liquidation
its
place
being
taken
by
local
banks
these
issued
notes
so
extravagantly
that
the
currency
of
the
country
as
stated
by
professor
sumner
was
depreciated
per
cent
so
great
was
the
universal
financial
distress
which
followed
the
unsound
system
of
banking
operations
that
in
a
new
bank
was
chartered
on
the
principles
which
hamilton
had
laid
down
this
bank
was
to
run
for
twenty
years
and
its
capital
was
millions
of
dollars
seven
of
which
were
taken
by
the
united
states
many
of
its
stockholders
were
widows
charitable
institutions
and
people
of
small
means
its
directors
were
chosen
by
the
stockholders
with
the
exception
of
five
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
the
public
money
was
deposited
in
this
bank
it
could
be
removed
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
but
by
him
only
on
giving
his
reasons
to
congress
the
bank
was
located
in
philadelphia
then
the
of
the
country
but
it
had
branches
in
different
cities
from
portsmouth
to
new
orleans
the
main
institution
could
issue
notes
not
under
five
dollars
but
the
branches
could

langdon
cleves
of
south
carolina
was
the
first
president
succeeded
in
by
nicholas
biddle
of
philadelphia
a
man
of
society
of
culture
and
of
leisure
a
young
man
of
who
could
talk
and
write
perhaps
better
than
he
could
manage
a
great
business
the
affairs
of
the
bank
went
on
smoothly
for
ten
or
twelve
years
and
the
financial
condition
of
the
country
was
never
better
than
when
controlled
by
this
great
central
institution
nicholas
biddle
of
course
was
magnified
into
a
great
financier
of
uncommon
genius
the
first
business
man
in
the
whole
country
a
great
financial
autocrat
the
idol
of
philadelphia
but
he
was
hated
by
democratic
politicians
as
a
man
who
was
intrusted
with
too
much
power
which
might
be
perverted
to
political
purposes
and
which
they
asserted
was
used
to
help
his
aristocratic
friends
in
difficulty
moreover
they
looked
with
envy
on
the
many
positions
its
offices
afforded
which
as
it
was
a
government
institution
they
thought
should
be
controlled
by
the
governing
party
among
biddle
especial
enemies
were
the
members
of
the
kitchen
cabinet
who
with
sycophantic
adroitness
used
jackson
as
a
tool
isaac
hill
of
new
hampshire
was
one
of
the
most
envenomed
of
these
politicians
who
hated
not
only
biddle
but
those
who
adhered
to
the
old
federalist
party
and
rich
men
generally
he
had
sufficient
plausibility
and
influence
to
enlist
levi
woodbury
senator
from
new
hampshire
to
forward
his
schemes
in
consequence
woodbury
on
june
wrote
to
ingham
secretary
of
the
treasury
making
complaints
against
the
president
of
the
branch
bank
in
portsmouth
for
roughness
of
manner
partiality
in
loans
and
severity
in
collections
the
accused
official
was
no
less
a
man
than
jeremiah
mason
probably
the
greatest
lawyer
in
new
england
if
not
of
the
whole
country
the
peer
as
well
as
the
friend
of
webster
ingham
sent
woodbury
letter
to
biddle
intimating
that
it
was
political
partiality
that
was
complained
of
then
ensued
a
correspondence
between
biddle
and
ingham
the
former
defending
mason
and
claiming
complete
independence
for
the
bank
as
to
its
management
so
long
as
it
could
not
be
shown
to
be
involved
in
political
movements
and
the
latter
accusing
threatening
to
remove
deposits
attempting
to
take
away
the
pension
agency
from
the
portsmouth
branch
it
was
a
stormy
summer
for
the
bank
thus
things
stood
until
november
when
a
letter
appeared
in
the
new
york
courier
and
inquirer
stating
that
president
jackson
in
his
forthcoming
first
annual
message
to
congress
would
come
out
strongly
against
the
bank
itself
and
sure
enough
the
president
in
his
message
astonished
the
whole
country
by
a
paragraph
attacking
the
bank
and
opposing
its
recharter
the
part
of
the
message
about
the
bank
was
referred
to
both
houses
of
congress
the
committees
reported
in
favor
of
the
bank
as
nothing
could
be
said
against
its
management
again
in
the
message
of
the
president
in
he
attacked
the
bank
and
benton
one
of
the
chief
supporters
of
jackson
in
spite
of
their
early
duel
declared
in
the
senate
that
the
charter
of
the
bank
ought
not
to
be
renewed
here
the
matter
dropped
for
a
while
as
jackson
and
his
friends
were
engrossed
in
electioneering
schemes
for
the
next
presidential
contest
and
the
troubles
of
the
cabinet
on
account
of
the
eaton
scandal
had
to
be
attended
to
as
already
noted
they
ended
in
its
dissolution
followed
by
a
new
and
stronger
cabinet
in
which
ingham
was
succeeded
as
secretary
of
the
treasury
by
louis
mclane
it
was
not
till
the
great
session
of
administrations
that
the
contest
was
taken
up
again
the
bank
aimed
to
have
its
charter
renewed
although
that
would
not
expire
for
five
years
yet
and
as
the
senate
was
partly
hostile
to
the
president
it
seemed
a
propitious
time
for
the
effort
jackson
on
the
other
hand
fearing
that
the
bank
would
succeed
in
getting
its
charter
renewed
with
a
friendly
congress
redoubled
his
energies
to
defeat
it
the
more
hostile
the
president
showed
himself
the
more
eager
were
the
friends
of
the
bank
for
immediate
action
it
was
with
them
now
or
never
if
the
matter
were
delayed
and
jackson
were
it
would
be
impossible
to
secure
a
renewal
of
the
charter
while
it
was
hoped
that
jackson
would
not
dare
to
veto
the
charter
on
the
eve
of
a
presidential
election
and
thus
lose
perhaps
the
vote
of
the
great
state
of
pennsylvania
so
it
was
resolved
by
the
friends
of
the
bank
to
press
the
measure
five
months
were
consumed
in
the
discussion
of
this
important
matter
in
which
the
leading
members
of
the
senate
except
benton
supported
the
bank
the
bill
to
renew
the
charter
passed
the
senate
on
the
of
june
by
a
vote
of
to
twenty
and
the
house
on
the
of
july
by
a
majority
of
it
was
immediately
vetoed
by
the
president
on
the
ground
that
the
bank
was
an
odious
monopoly
with
nearly
a
third
of
its
stock
held
by
foreigners
and
not
only
odious
but
dangerous
as
a
to
bribe
congress
and
influence
elections
the
message
accompanying
the
veto
was
able
and
was
supposed
to
be
written
by
edward
livingston
or
amos
kendall
biddle
remained
calm
and
confident
like
clay
he
never
dreamed
that
jackson
would
dare
to
persist
in
a
hostility
against
the
enlightened
public
sentiment
of
the
country
but
jackson
was
the
idol
of
the
democracy
who
would
support
all
his
measures
and
condone
all
his
faults
and
the
democracy
ruled
as
it
always
will
rule
except
in
great
public
dangers
when
power
naturally
falls
into
the
hands
of
men
of
genius
honesty
and
experience
almost
independently
of
their
political
associations
the
veto
aroused
a
thunder
of
debate
webster
and
clay
leading
the
assault
upon
it
and
benton
with
other
jacksonians
defending
it
the
attempt
to
pass
the
bill
over
the
veto
failed
of
the
necessary
majority
and
the
president
was
triumphant
jackson
had
no
idea
of
yielding
his
opinions
or
his
will
to
anybody
least
of
all
to
his
political
enemies
the
war
with
the
bank
must
go
on
but
its
charter
had
three
or
four
years
still
to
run
all
he
could
do
legally
was
to
cripple
it
by
removing
the
deposits
his
animosity
inflamed
by
the
denunciations
of
benton
kendall
blair
hill
and
others
became
ungovernable
mclane
was
now
succeeded
in
the
treasury
department
by
duane
of
philadelphia
the
firmest
and
most
incorruptible
of
men
for
whom
the
president
felt
the
greatest
respect
but
whom
he
expected
to
bend
to
his
purposes
as
he
had
ingham
only
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
could
remove
the
deposits
and
this
duane
unexpectedly
but
persistently
refused
to
do
jackson
brought
to
bear
upon
him
all
his
powers
of
persuasion
and
friendship
duane
still
stood
firm
then
the
president
resorted
to
threats
all
to
no
purpose
at
length
duane
was
dismissed
from
his
office
and
roger
taney
became
secretary
of
the
treasury
of
september
three
days
afterwards
taney
directed
collectors
to
deposit
the
public
money
in
certain
banks
which
he
designated
it
seems
singular
that
the
man
who
two
years
later
was
appointed
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
and
who
discharged
the
duties
of
that
office
so
ably
and
uprightly
should
so
readily
have
complied
with
the
president
desire
but
this
must
be
accounted
for
by
the
facts
that
in
regard
to
the
bank
taney
views
were
in
harmony
with
those
of
jackson
and
that
the
removal
of
the
deposits
however
arbitrary
was
not
unconstitutional
the
removal
of
more
than
nine
millions
from
the
bank
within
the
period
of
nine
months
caused
it
necessarily
to
curtail
its
discounts
and
a
financial
panic
was
the
result
which
again
led
to
acrimonious
debates
in
congress
in
which
clay
took
the
lead
his
opposition
exasperated
the
president
in
the
highest
degree
calhoun
equalled
clay
in
the
vehemence
of
his
denunciation
for
his
hatred
of
jackson
was
greater
than
his
hostility
to
moneyed
corporations
webster
was
less
irritating
but
equally
strong
in
his
disapproval
jackson
in
his
message
of
december
reiterated
his
charge
against
the
bank
as
a
permanent
electioneering
engine
attempting
to
control
public
opinion
through
the
distresses
of
some
and
the
fears
of
others
the
senate
passed
resolutions
denouncing
the
measures
of
the
government
which
however
were
afterwards
expunged
when
the
senate
had
become
democratic
one
of
the
most
eloquent
passages
that
clay
ever
uttered
was
his
famous
apostrophe
to
vice
president
van
buren
when
presiding
over
the
senate
in
reference
to
the
financial
distress
which
existed
throughout
the
country
and
which
of
course
he
traced
to
the
removal
of
the
deposits
deputations
of
great
respectability
poured
in
upon
the
president
from
every
quarter
to
induce
him
to
change
his
policy
all
of
which
he
summarily
and
rudely
dismissed
all
that
these
deputations
could
get
out
of
him
was
go
to
nicholas
biddle
he
has
all
the
money
in
during
the
second
term
of
jackson
office
there
were
committees
sent
to
investigate
the
affairs
of
the
bank
who
were
very
cavalierly
treated
by
biddle
so
that
their
mission
failed
amid
much
derision
he
was
not
dethroned
from
his
financial
power
until
the
united
states
bank
of
pennsylvania
the
style
under
which
the
united
states
bank
accepted
a
state
charter
in
when
its
original
national
charter
expired
succumbed
to
the
general
crash
in
it
is
now
generally
admitted
that
jackson
war
on
the
bank
was
violent
and
reckless
although
it
would
be
difficult
to
point
out
wherein
his
hostility
exceeded
constitutional
limits
the
consequences
were
most
disastrous
to
the
immediate
interests
of
the
country
but
probably
not
to
its
ultimate
interests
the
substitution
of
pet
banks
for
government
deposits
led
to
a
great
inflation
of
paper
money
followed
by
a
general
mania
for
speculation
when
the
bubble
burst
these
banks
were
unable
to
redeem
their
notes
in
gold
and
silver
and
suspended
their
payments
then
the
stringency
of
the
money
market
equalled
the
previous
inflation
in
consequence
there
were
innumerable
failures
and
everything
fell
in
value
lands
houses
and
goods
such
was
the
general
depression
and
scarcity
of
money
that
in
many
states
it
was
difficult
to
raise
money
even
to
pay
necessary
taxes
i
have
somewhere
read
that
in
one
of
the
western
states
the
sheriffs
sold
at
auction
a
good
wagon
for
five
dollars
and
fifty
cents
two
horses
for
four
dollars
and
two
cows
for
two
dollars
the
western
farmers
were
driven
to
despair
such
was
the
general
depression
that
president
van
buren
was
compelled
in
to
call
an
extra
session
of
congress
nor
were
the
difficulties
removed
until
the
celebrated
bankrupt
law
was
passed
in
chiefly
through
the
efforts
of
daniel
webster
which
virtually
wiped
out
all
debts
of
those
who
chose
to
avail
themselves
of
the
privilege
what
a
contrast
was
the
financial
state
of
the
country
at
that
time
to
what
it
was
when
jackson
entered
upon
his
administration
it
is
not
just
to
attribute
all
the
commercial
disasters
which
followed
the
winding
up
of
the
old
united
states
bank
to
general
jackson
and
to
the
financial
schemes
of
van
buren
it
was
the
spirit
of
speculation
fostered
by
the
inflation
of
paper
money
by
irresponsible
banks
when
the
great
was
stopped
which
was
the
direct
cause
the
indirect
causes
of
commercial
disaster
however
may
be
attributed
to
jackson
war
on
the
bank
the
long
fight
in
congress
to
secure
a
recharter
of
the
bank
though
unsuccessful
was
dignified
and
statesmanlike
but
the
ungoverned
passions
displayed
by
the
removal
of
deposits
resulted
in
nothing
and
could
have
resulted
in
nothing
of
advantage
to
any
theory
of
the
bank
management
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
who
were
most
to
blame
for
the
foolish
and
undignified
crimination
and
recrimination
which
followed
the
president
or
the
hostile
senate
it
was
at
any
rate
a
fight
in
which
jackson
won
but
which
from
the
animosities
it
kindled
brought
down
his
gray
hairs
in
sorrow
to
the
grave
it
gave
him
a
doubtful
place
in
the
history
of
the
nation
if
jackson
hostility
to
the
united
states
bank
was
inexpedient
and
violent
and
resulted
in
financial
disasters
his
vigorous
efforts
to
put
down
nullification
were
patriotic
and
called
forth
the
approval
and
gratitude
of
the
nation
this
was
a
real
service
of
immense
value
and
it
is
probable
that
no
other
public
man
then
on
the
stage
could
have
done
this
important
work
so
well
like
all
jackson
measures
it
was
summary
and
decided
nullification
grew
out
of
the
tariffs
which
congress
had
imposed
the
south
wanted
no
protective
duties
at
all
indeed
it
wanted
absolute
free
trade
so
that
planters
might
obtain
the
articles
which
they
needed
at
the
smallest
possible
cost
and
sell
as
much
cotton
and
tobacco
as
they
could
with
the
least
delay
and
embarrassment
professor
sumner
argues
that
southern
industries
either
supported
the
federal
government
or
paid
tribute
to
the
northern
manufacturers
and
that
consequently
the
grievances
of
the
southern
states
were
natural
and
just
that
their
interests
were
sacrificed
to
national
interests
as
the
new
england
interests
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
national
interests
at
the
time
of
the
embargo
undoubtedly
the
south
had
cause
of
complaint
and
we
can
not
wonder
at
its
irritation
and
opposition
to
the
taxes
imposed
on
all
for
the
protection
of
american
manufactures
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
grave
question
whether
the
interests
of
the
nation
at
large
should
be
sacrificed
to
build
up
the
interests
of
the
south
to
say
nothing
of
the
great
moral
issues
which
underlie
all
material
questions
in
other
words
in
matters
of
national
importance
which
should
rule
should
the
majority
yield
to
the
minority
or
the
minority
to
the
majority
in
accordance
with
the
democratic
principles
on
which
this
government
is
founded
there
is
only
one
reply
to
the
question
the
majority
must
rule
this
is
the
basal
stone
of
all
constitutional
government
whose
disruption
would
produce
revolution
and
anarchy
it
is
a
bitter
and
humiliating
necessity
which
compels
the
intellect
the
wealth
the
rank
and
the
fashion
of
england
to
yield
to
the
small
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
in
the
matter
of
irish
home
rule
but
an
irishman
vote
is
as
good
as
that
of
the
son
of
an
english
peer
the
rule
of
the
majority
is
the
price
of
political
liberty
for
which
enlightened
nations
are
willing
to
pay
henry
clay
deserves
great
praise
and
glory
for
his
persistent
efforts
at
conciliation
not
only
in
matters
pertaining
to
the
tariff
but
in
the
question
of
slavery
to
harmonize
conflicting
interests
but
calhoun
the
greatest
man
whom
the
south
has
produced
would
listen
to
no
concessions
foreseeing
that
the
slightest
would
endanger
the
institution
with
which
the
interests
and
pride
of
the
southern
states
were
identified
at
this
crisis
the
country
needed
a
man
at
the
helm
whose
will
was
known
to
be
inflexible
in
the
session
of
on
a
question
concerning
the
sales
of
public
lands
in
the
several
states
arose
the
great
debate
between
colonel
hayne
of
south
carolina
and
daniel
webster
on
the
limitations
of
federal
power
and
hayne
declaration
of
the
right
of
a
state
to
nullify
a
federal
law
that
was
prejudicial
to
its
interests
gained
him
great
applause
throughout
the
south
john
calhoun
united
states
senator
from
south
carolina
was
at
the
head
of
the
extreme
state
sovereignty
party
and
at
a
banquet
celebrating
the
birthday
of
jefferson
january
he
proffered
the
toast
the
union
next
to
liberty
the
most
dear
may
we
all
remember
that
it
can
only
be
preserved
by
respecting
the
rights
of
the
states
and
distributing
equally
the
benefit
and
burden
of
the
union
jackson
as
president
and
practical
chief
of
the
democracy
was
of
course
present
at
this
political
banquet
his
profound
patriotism
and
keen
political
instinct
scented
danger
and
with
his
usual
impulse
to
go
well
forward
to
meet
an
enemy
he
gave
the
federal
union
it
must
be
preserved
this
simple
declaration
was
worth
more
than
all
the
wordy
messages
and
proclamations
he
ever
issued
it
not
only
served
notice
upon
the
seceders
of
his
time
that
they
had
a
great
principle
to
deal
with
but
it
echoed
after
him
and
was
the
call
to
which
the
nation
victoriously
rallied
in
its
supreme
struggle
with
treason
thirty
years
later
notwithstanding
the
evident
stand
taken
by
the
president
the
calhoun
party
continued
their
opposition
on
state
lines
to
the
federal
authority
and
when
congress
passed
the
tariff
of
july
the
south
carolina
legislature
in
the
autumn
called
a
convention
which
pronounced
that
act
and
the
tariff
act
of
unconstitutional
null
and
void
and
no
law
called
on
the
state
legislature
to
pass
laws
to
prevent
the
execution
of
the
federal
revenue
acts
and
declared
that
any
attempt
at
coercion
on
the
part
of
the
federal
authorities
would
be
regarded
as
absolving
south
carolina
and
all
its
people
from
all
further
obligation
to
retain
their
union
with
the
other
states
and
that
they
should
then
forthwith
proceed
to
organize
a
separate
government
as
a
sovereign
and
independent
state
if
such
a
man
as
buchanan
had
then
been
in
the
presidential
chair
there
probably
would
have
been
a
southern
confederacy
and
in
it
might
have
been
successful
but
jackson
was
a
man
of
different
mould
democrat
and
southern
sympathizer
as
he
was
he
instantly
took
the
most
vigorous
measures
to
suppress
such
a
thing
in
the
bud
before
there
was
time
to
concert
measures
of
disunion
among
the
other
southern
states
he
sent
general
scott
to
charleston
with
a
body
of
troops
stationed
not
far
away
he
ordered
two
to
the
harbor
of
the
misguided
and
rebellious
city
on
december
in
his
annual
message
he
called
the
attention
of
congress
to
the
opposition
to
the
revenue
laws
and
intimated
that
he
should
enforce
them
on
december
he
issued
a
proclamation
to
the
inhabitants
of
south
carolina
written
by
livingston
moderate
in
tone
in
which
it
was
set
forth
that
the
power
of
one
state
to
annul
a
law
of
the
united
states
was
incompatible
with
the
existence
of
the
union
and
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
governor
hayne
issued
a
while
calhoun
resigned
the
in
order
to
represent
south
carolina
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
in
january
the
president
sent
another
message
to
congress
asking
for
authority
to
suppress
rebellion
congress
rallied
around
the
executive
and
a
bill
was
passed
providing
for
the
enforcement
of
the
collection
of
the
customs
at
charleston
and
arming
the
president
with
extraordinary
powers
to
see
that
the
dangers
were
averted
most
of
the
states
passed
resolutions
against
nullification
and
there
was
general
approval
of
the
vigorous
measures
to
be
enforced
if
necessary
the
nullifiers
unprepared
to
resist
the
whole
military
power
of
the
country
yielded
but
with
ill
grace
to
the
threatened
force
henry
clay
in
february
introduced
a
compromise
tariff
and
on
the
of
that
month
it
was
completed
together
with
an
enforcement
act
on
march
it
became
a
law
and
on
march
the
south
carolina
nullifiers
held
an
adjourned
meeting
of
their
convention
and
nullified
their
previous
nullification
the
triumph
of
jackson
was
complete
and
his
popularity
reached
its
apex
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
collection
of
duties
in
southern
parts
was
the
only
cause
of
nullification
the
deeper
cause
was
not
at
first
avowed
it
was
the
question
of
slavery
which
is
too
large
a
topic
to
be
discussed
in
this
connection
it
will
be
treated
more
fully
in
a
subsequent
lecture
an
important
event
took
place
during
the
administration
of
jackson
which
demands
our
notice
although
it
can
in
no
way
be
traced
to
his
influence
and
this
was
the
movement
ending
in
the
formation
of
a
new
political
party
the
beginning
of
this
party
was
obscure
enough
one
morgan
in
western
new
york
was
abducted
and
murdered
for
revealing
the
alleged
secrets
of
freemasonry
these
were
in
reality
of
small
importance
but
morgan
had
mortally
offended
a
great
secret
society
of
which
he
was
a
member
by
bringing
it
into
public
contempt
his
punishment
was
greater
than
his
crime
which
had
been
not
against
morality
but
against
a
powerful
body
of
men
who
never
did
any
harm
but
rather
much
good
in
the
way
of
charities
the
outrage
aroused
public
indignation
that
a
man
should
be
murdered
for
making
innocent
revelations
of
mere
ceremonies
and
pretensions
of
small
moment
and
as
the
masons
would
make
no
apologies
and
no
efforts
to
bring
the
offenders
to
justice
it
was
inferred
by
the
credulous
public
that
masons
were
not
fit
to
be
entrusted
with
political
office
the
outrage
was
seized
upon
by
cunning
politicians
to
make
political
capital
jackson
was
a
mason
hence
the
new
party
of
made
war
against
him
as
they
had
been
his
supporters
the
democratic
party
of
the
state
of
new
york
was
divided
the
leading
democratic
leaders
had
endeavored
to
suppress
this
schism
but
it
daily
increased
founded
on
popular
ignorance
and
prejudice
until
it
became
formidable
in
four
years
after
the
murder
the
had
held
conventions
and
framed
a
political
platform
of
principles
the
chief
of
which
was
hostility
to
all
secret
societies
the
party
against
all
reason
rapidly
spread
through
new
york
pennsylvania
and
new
england
its
stronghold
being
among
the
farmers
of
vermont
ambitious
politicians
soon
perceived
that
a
union
with
this
party
would
favor
their
interests
and
men
of
high
position
became
its
leaders
in
the
party
was
strong
enough
to
assemble
a
convention
in
baltimore
to
nominate
candidates
for
the
presidency
and
william
wirt
the
great
maryland
lawyer
was
nominated
not
with
any
hope
of
election
but
with
the
view
of
dividing
the
ranks
of
the
democratic
party
and
of
strengthening
the
opposition
headed
by
clay
the
national
republican
party
which
in
the
next
campaign
absorbed
all
the
old
federalist
remnants
and
became
the
whig
party
all
opposition
to
jackson
however
was
to
no
purpose
he
was
elected
for
his
second
term
beginning
in
the
movement
subsided
as
rapidly
as
it
was
created
having
no
principles
to
stand
upon
it
has
already
passed
into
oblivion
i
have
now
presented
the
principal
subjects
which
made
the
administrations
of
jackson
memorable
there
are
others
of
minor
importance
which
could
be
mentioned
like
the
removal
of
the
indians
to
remote
in
the
west
the
west
india
trade
the
successful
settlement
of
the
spoliation
claims
against
france
which
threatened
to
involve
the
country
in
war
prevented
by
the
arbitration
of
england
similar
settlements
with
denmark
spain
and
naples
treaties
of
commerce
with
russia
and
turkey
and
other
matters
in
which
decided
character
appeared
to
advantage
but
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
write
a
complete
history
of
jackson
or
of
his
administrations
those
who
want
fuller
information
should
read
parton
long
biography
in
which
almost
every
subject
under
the
sun
is
alluded
to
and
yet
which
in
spite
of
its
inartistic
and
unclassical
execution
is
the
best
thesaurus
i
know
of
for
jacksonian
materials
more
recent
histories
are
dissertations
in
disguise
on
disputed
points
here
then
i
bring
this
lecture
to
a
close
with
a
brief
allusion
to
those
things
which
made
up
the
character
of
a
very
remarkable
man
who
did
both
good
and
evil
in
his
public
career
his
private
life
is
unusually
interesting
by
no
means
a
model
for
others
to
imitate
yet
showing
great
energy
a
wonderful
power
of
will
and
undoubted
honesty
of
purpose
his
faults
were
those
which
may
be
traced
to
an
imperfect
education
excessive
prejudices
a
violent
temper
and
the
incense
of
flatterers
which
turned
his
head
and
of
which
he
was
inordinately
fond
we
fail
to
see
in
him
the
modesty
which
marked
washington
and
most
of
the
succeeding
presidents
as
a
young
man
he
fought
duels
without
sufficient
provocation
he
put
himself
in
his
military
career
above
the
law
and
in
his
presidential
career
above
precedents
and
customs
which
subjected
him
to
grave
animadversion
as
a
general
he
hanged
two
respectable
foreigners
as
spies
without
sufficient
evidence
he
inflicted
unnecessary
cruelties
in
order
to
maintain
military
discipline
wholesome
doubtless
but
such
as
less
arbitrary
commanders
would
have
hesitated
to
do
he
invaded
the
territory
of
a
neutral
state
on
the
plea
of
in
his
conversation
he
used
expletives
not
considered
in
good
taste
and
which
might
be
called
swearing
without
meaning
any
irreverence
to
the
deity
although
in
later
life
he
seldom
used
any
other
oath
than
by
the
eternal
personally
jackson
habits
were
irreproachable
in
regard
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
he
was
temperate
almost
abstemious
he
was
always
religiously
inclined
and
joined
the
church
before
he
died
perhaps
however
out
of
loyalty
to
his
wife
whom
he
adored
rather
than
from
theological
convictions
but
whatever
he
deemed
his
duty
he
made
every
sacrifice
to
perform
although
fond
of
power
he
was
easily
accessible
and
he
was
frank
and
genial
among
his
intimate
friends
with
great
ideas
of
personal
dignity
he
was
unconventional
in
all
his
habits
and
detested
useless
ceremonies
and
the
etiquette
of
courts
he
put
a
great
value
on
personal
friendships
and
never
broke
them
except
under
necessity
for
his
enemies
he
cherished
a
vindictive
wrath
as
unforgiving
as
nemesis
in
the
white
house
jackson
was
remarkably
hospitable
and
he
returned
to
his
beloved
hermitage
poorer
than
when
he
left
it
he
cared
little
for
money
although
an
excellent
manager
of
his
farm
he
was
and
just
in
the
discharge
of
debts
and
although
arbitrary
he
was
indulgent
to
his
servants
he
loved
frankness
in
his
dealings
with
advisers
although
he
was
easily
imposed
upon
while
he
leaned
on
the
counsels
of
his
kitchen
cabinet
he
rarely
summoned
a
council
of
constitutional
advisers
he
parted
with
one
of
the
ablest
and
best
of
his
cabinet
who
acted
from
a
sense
of
duty
in
a
matter
where
he
was
plainly
right
toward
nicholas
biddle
and
henry
clay
he
cherished
the
most
inexorable
animosity
for
crossing
his
path
when
we
remember
his
lack
of
political
knowledge
his
spoils
system
his
indifference
to
internal
improvements
his
war
on
the
united
states
bank
and
his
arbitrary
conduct
in
general
we
feel
that
elevation
to
the
presidency
was
a
mistake
and
a
national
misfortune
however
popular
he
was
with
the
masses
yet
he
was
in
accord
with
his
generation
it
is
singular
that
this
man
did
nothing
to
attract
national
notice
until
he
was
years
of
age
the
fortune
of
war
placed
him
on
a
throne
where
he
reigned
as
a
dictator
so
far
as
his
powers
would
allow
happily
in
his
eventful
administration
he
was
impeded
by
hostile
and
cynical
senators
but
this
wholesale
restraint
embittered
his
life
his
great
personal
popularity
continued
to
the
end
of
his
life
in
but
his
influence
is
felt
to
this
day
both
for
good
and
for
evil
his
patriotism
and
his
prejudices
his
sturdy
friendships
and
his
relentless
hatreds
his
fearless
discharge
of
duty
and
his
obstinacy
of
his
splendid
public
services
and
the
vast
public
ills
he
inaugurated
will
ever
make
this
picturesque
old
hero
a
puzzle
to
moralists
his
life
was
turbulent
and
he
was
glad
when
the
time
came
to
lay
down
his
burden
and
prepare
himself
for
that
dread
tribunal
before
which
all
mortals
will
be
finally
summoned
the
one
tribunal
in
which
he
believed
and
the
only
one
which
he
was
prompt
to
acknowledge
authorities
the
works
written
on
jackson
are
very
numerous
probably
the
best
is
the
biography
written
by
parton
defective
as
it
is
professor
work

the

as

policy
and

of
this
country
only
two
other
american
statesmen
hamilton
and
webster
can
be
compared
to
him
in
genius
power
and
services
these
two
great
characters
will
be
found
treated
elsewhere
in
regard
to
what
is
called
birth
clay
was
not
a
patrician
like
washington
nor
had
he
so
humble
an
origin
as
andrew
jackson
or
abraham
lincoln
like
most
other
great
men
he
was
the
architect
of
of
his
own
fortunes
doomed
to
drudgeries
in
the
early
part
of
his
career
and
climbing
into
notice
by
energy
and
force
of
character
he
was
born
in
a
little
virginian
hamlet
called
the
slashes
in
hanover
county
the
son
of
a
baptist
minister
who
preached
to
poor
people
and
who
died
when
henry
was
four
years
old
leaving
six
other
children
and
a
widow
with
very
scanty
means
of
support
the
little
country
school
taught
him
the
rudiments
and
his
small
earnings
as
and
meantime
helped
his
mother
the
mother
was
marked
by
sterling
traits
of
character
and
married
for
her
second
husband
a
captain
watkins
of
richmond
this
worthy
man
treated
his
kindly
and
put
him
into
a
retail
store
at
the
age
of
fourteen
no
better
educated
than
most
country
lads
too
poor
to
go
to
college
but
with
aspirations
which
all
bright
and
ambitious
boys
are
apt
to
have
especially
if
they
have
no
fitness
for
selling
the
common
things
of
life
and
are
fond
of
reading
henry
having
an
influential
friend
secured
for
the
disgusted
and
discontented
youth
a
position
in
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
high
court
of
chancery
of
which
the
eminent
jurist
george
wythe
was
chancellor
the
judge
and
the
young
copyist
thus
naturally
became
acquainted
and
acquaintance
ripened
into
friendship
for
the
youth
was
bright
and
useful
and
made
an
excellent
amanuensis
to
the
learned
old
lawyer
in
whose
office
both
thomas
jefferson
and
john
marshall
had
been
students
of
law
after
serving
four
years
clay
resolved
to
become
a
lawyer
entered
the
office
of
the
of
the
state
and
one
year
after
was
admitted
to
the
bar
having
in
all
probability
acquired
much
legal
knowledge
from
the
communicative
chancellor
whom
everybody
loved
and
honored
one
of
the
earliest
in
virginia
to
emancipate
his
slaves
and
provide
for
their
support
the
young
fellow
reading
also
had
been
guided
by
his
learned
friend
in
the
direction
of
history
english
grammar
and
the
beginnings
of
law
the
young
lawyer
with
his
pleasing
manners
quick
intelligence
and
real
kindness
of
heart
soon
became
a
favorite
in
richmond
society
he
was
neither
handsome
nor
elegant
nor
aristocratic
but
he
had
personal
geniality
wit
brilliancy
in
conversation
irreproachable
morals
and
was
prominent
in
the
debating
society
a
school
where
young
men
learn
the
art
of
public
speaking
like
gladstone
at
oxford
it
is
thought
probable
that
clay
native
oratorical
ability
which
he
assiduously
cultivated
the
gift
which
as
schurz
says
enabled
him
to
make
little
tell
for
much
and
to
outshine
men
of
vastly
greater
learning
misled
him
as
to
the
necessity
for
systematic
and
thorough
study
lack
of
thoroughness
and
of
solid
information
was
his
especial
weakness
through
life
in
spite
of
the
charm
and
power
of
his
personal
oratory
it
is
always
work
for
a
young
lawyer
to
succeed
in
a
fashionable
city
where
there
is
more
intellect
than
business
and
when
he
himself
has
neither
family
nor
money
nor
mercantile
friends
so
henry
clay
at
turned
his
eyes
to
the
west
the
land
of
promise
which
was
especially
attractive
to
impecunious
lawyers
needy
farmers
spendthrift
gentlemen
merchants
without
capital
and
vigorous
men
of
enterprise
where
everybody
trusts
and
is
trusted
and
where
talents
and
character
are
of
more
value
than
money
he
had
not
much
legal
knowledge
nor
did
he
need
much
in
the
frontier
settlements
on
the
ohio
and
its
valleys
the
people
generally
were
rough
and
illiterate
and
attached
more
importance
to
and
industry
than
to
legal
technicalities
and
the
subtle
distinctions
of
coke
and
blackstone
if
an
advocate
could
grasp
a
principle
which
appealed
to
consciousness
and
enforce
it
with
native
eloquence
he
was
more
likely
to
succeed
than
one
versed
in
learned
precedents
without
energy
or
plausible
utterances
the
locality
which
clay
selected
was
lexington
in
kentucky
then
a
small
village
in
the
midst
of
beautiful
groves
without
underbrush
where
the
soil
was
of
virgin
richness
and
the
landscape
painted
with
almost
perpetual
verdure
one
of
the
most
attractive
spots
by
nature
on
the
face
of
the
earth
a
great
contrast
to
the
flat
prairies
of
illinois
or
the
tangled
forests
of
michigan
or
the
alluvial
deposits
of
the
mississippi
it
was
a
paradise
of
hills
and
vales
easily
converted
into
lawns
and
gardens
such
as
the
primitive
settlers
of
new
england
would
have
looked
upon
with
blended
envy
and
astonishment
lexington
in
the
year
that
clay
settled
in
it
as
a
lawyer
was
called
the
intellectual
centre
of
the
far
west
as
the
ohio
valley
was
then
regarded
in
reality
it
was
a
the
inhabitants
of
which
were
devoted
to
hunting
and
with
a
sprinkling
of
educated
people
among
whom
the
young
lawyer
soon
distinguished
himself
a
born
orator
logical
as
well
as
rhetorical
clay
law
practice
at
first
was
chiefly
directed
to
the
defence
of
criminals
and
it
is
said
that
no
murderer
whom
he
defended
was
ever
hanged
but
he
soon
was
equally
successful
in
civil
cases
gradually
acquiring
a
lucrative
practice
without
taking
a
high
rank
as
a
jurist
he
was
never
a
close
student
being
too
much
absorbed
in
politics
society
and
pleasure
except
on
rare
occasions
for
which
he
crammed
his
reading
was
desultory
and
his
favorite
works
were
political
speeches
many
of
which
he
committed
to
memory
and
then
declaimed
to
the
delight
of
all
who
heard
him
his
progress
at
the
bar
must
have
been
remarkably
rapid
since
within
two
years
he
could
afford
to
purchase
six
hundred
acres
of
land
near
lexington
and
take
unto
himself
a
wife
domestic
thrifty
painstaking
who
attended
to
all
the
details
of
the
farm
which
he
called
ashland
as
he
grew
in
wealth
his
popularity
also
increased
until
in
all
kentucky
no
one
was
so
generally
beloved
as
he
yet
he
would
not
now
be
called
opulent
and
he
never
became
rich
since
his
hospitalities
were
disproportionate
to
his
means
and
his
living
was
more
like
that
of
a
virginia
country
gentleman
than
of
a
lawyer
at
this
time
clay
was
tall
erect
commanding
with
long
arms
small
hands
a
large
mouth
blue
electrical
eyes
high
forehead
a
sanguine
temperament
excitable
easy
in
his
manners
courteous
deferential
with
a
voice
penetrating
and
musical
with
great
command
of
language
and
so
earnest
that
he
impressed
everybody
with
his
blended
sincerity
and
kindness
of
heart
the
true
field
for
such
a
man
was
politics
which
clay
loved
so
that
his
duties
and
pleasures
went
hand
in
hand
an
essential
thing
for
great
success
his
first
efforts
were
in
connection
with
a
constitutional
convention
in
kentucky
when
he
earnestly
advocated
a
system
of
gradual
emancipation
of
slaves
unpopular
as
that
idea
was
among
his
it
did
not
seem
however
to
hurt
his
political
prospects
for
in
he
was
solicited
to
become
a
member
of
the
state
legislature
and
was
easily
elected
being
a
member
of
the
party
as
led
by
jefferson
he
made
his
mark
at
once
as
an
orator
and
so
brilliant
and
rapid
was
his
legislative
career
that
he
was
elected
in
to
the
united
states
senate
to
fill
the
unexpired
term
of
john
adair
being
only
years
old
the
youngest
man
that
ever
sat
in
that
body
of
legislators
all
that
could
then
be
said
of
him
was
that
he
made
a
good
impression
in
the
debates
and
on
the
committees
and
was
a
man
of
great
promise
a
favorite
in
society
attending
all
parties
of
pleasure
and
never
at
home
in
the
evening
on
his
return
to
kentucky
he
was
again
elected
as
a
member
of
the
lower
house
in
the
state
legislature
and
chosen
speaker
an
excellent
training
for
the
larger
place
he
was
to
fill
in
the
winter
of
he
was
a
second
time
sent
to
the
united
states
senate
for
two
years
to
fill
the
unexpired
term
of
buckner
thurston
where
he
made
speeches
in
favor
of
encouraging
american
manufacturing
industries
not
to
the
extent
of
exportation
which
he
thought
should
be
confined
to
surplus
but
enough
to
supply
the
people
with
clothing
and
to
make
them
independent
of
foreign
countries
for
many
things
unnecessarily
imported
he
also
made
himself
felt
on
many
other
important
topics
and
was
recognized
as
a
rising
man
when
his
term
had
expired
in
the
senate
he
was
chosen
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
at
washington
a
more
agreeable
field
to
him
than
the
senate
as
giving
him
greater
scope
for
his
peculiar
eloquence
he
was
promptly
elected
speaker
which
position
however
did
not
interfere
with
his
whenever
the
house
went
into
committee
of
the
whole
it
was
as
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
that
clay
drew
upon
himself
the
eyes
of
the
nation
and
his
truly
great
congressional
career
began
in
on
the
eve
of
the
war
with
great
britain
in
madison
administration
clay
was
now
the
most
influential
and
certainly
the
most
popular
man
in
public
life
in
the
whole
country
which
was
very
remarkable
considering
that
he
was
only
years
of
age
daniel
webster
was
then
practising
law
in
portsmouth
two
years
before
his
election
to
congress
and
john
calhoun
had
not
yet
entered
the
senate
but
was
chairman
of
the
committee
of
foreign
relations
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
a
warm
friend
of
the
speaker
the
absorbing
subject
of
national
interest
at
that
time
was
the
threatened
war
with
england
which
clay
did
his
best
to
bring
about
and
webster
to
prevent
it
was
webster
oration
at
portsmouth
in
which
led
to
his
election
to
congress
as
a
federalist
in
which
oration
he
deprecated
war
the
west
generally
was
in
favor
of
it
having
not
much
to
lose
or
to
fear
from
a
contest
which
chiefly
affected
commerce
and
which
would
jeopardize
only
new
england
interests
and
the
safety
of
maritime
towns
clay
who
had
from
his
first
appearance
at
washington
made
himself
a
champion
of
american
interests
american
honor
and
american
ideas
generally
represented
the
popular
party
and
gave
his
voice
for
war
into
which
the
government
had
drifted
under
pressure
of
the
outrages
inflicted
by
british
cruisers
the
impressment
of
our
seamen
and
the
contempt
with
which
the
united
states
were
held
and
spoken
of
on
all
occasions
by
england
the
latter
an
element
more
offensive
to
none
than
to
the
independent
and
bellicose
settlers
in
ohio
kentucky
and
tennessee
clay
is
generally
credited
with
having
turned
the
scales
in
favor
of
the
war
with
great
britain
when
the
united
states
comprised
less
than
eight
millions
of
people
when
the
country
had
no
navy
of
any
account
and
a
very
small
army
without
experienced
officers
while
great
britain
was
mistress
of
the
seas
with
an
enormous
army
and
the
leader
of
the
allied
powers
that
withstood
napoleon
in
spain
and
portugal
to
the
eyes
of
the
federalists
the
contest
was
rash
inexpedient
and
doubtful
in
its
issues
and
their
views
were
justified
by
the
disasters
that
ensued
in
canada
the
incompetency
of
hull
the
successive
defeats
of
american
generals
with
the
exception
of
jackson
and
the
final
treaty
of
peace
without
allusion
to
the
main
causes
which
had
led
to
the
war
but
the
republicans
claimed
that
the
war
if
disastrous
on
the
land
had
been
glorious
on
the
water
that
the
national
honor
had
been
vindicated
that
a
navy
had
been
created
that
the
impressment
of
american
seamen
was
practically
ended
forever
and
that
england
had
learned
to
treat
the
great
republic
with
outward
respect
as
an
independent
powerful
and
constantly
increasing
empire
as
the
champion
of
the
war
and
for
the
brilliancy
and
patriotism
of
his
speeches
all
appealing
to
the
national
heart
and
to
national
pride
clay
stood
out
as
the
most
eminent
statesman
of
his
day
with
unbounded
popularity
especially
in
kentucky
where
to
the
last
he
retained
his
hold
on
popular
admiration
and
affection
his
speeches
on
the
war
are
more
marked
for
pungency
of
satire
and
bitterness
of
invective
against
england
than
for
moral
wisdom
they
are
appeals
to
passions
rather
than
to
reason
of
great
force
in
their
day
but
of
not
much
value
to
posterity
they
are
not
read
and
quoted
like
webster
masterpieces
they
will
not
compare
except
in
popular
eloquence
with
clay
own
subsequent
efforts
in
the
senate
when
he
had
more
maturity
of
knowledge
and
more
insight
into
the
principles
of
political
economy
but
they
had
great
influence
at
the
time
and
added
to
his
fame
as
an
orator
in
the
summer
of
clay
resigned
his
speakership
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
accept
a
diplomatic
mission
as
peace
commissioner
to
confer
with
commissioners
from
great
britain
he
had
as
associates
john
quincy
adams
james
bayard
jonathan
russell
and
albert
gallatin
the
ablest
financier
in
the
country
after
the
death
of
hamilton
the
commissioners
met
at
ghent
and
spent
five
tedious
months
in
that
dull
city
the
english
commissioners
at
once
took
very
high
ground
and
made
imperious
demands
that
the
territory
now
occupied
by
the
states
of
michigan
illinois
wisconsin
indiana
and
a
part
of
ohio
should
be
set
apart
for
the
indians
under
an
english
protectorate
that
the
united
states
should
relinquish
the
right
of
keeping
armed
vessels
on
the
great
lakes
that
a
part
of
maine
should
be
ceded
to
great
britain
to
make
a
road
from
halifax
to
quebec
and
that
all
questions
relating
to
the
right
of
search
blockades
and
impressment
of
seamen
should
remain
undiscussed
as
before
the
war
at
these
preposterous
demands
clay
was
especially
indignant
in
fact
he
was
opposed
to
any
treaty
at
all
which
should
not
place
the
united
states
and
great
britain
on
an
equality
and
would
not
have
been
grieved
if
the
war
had
lasted
three
years
longer
adams
and
gallatin
had
their
hands
full
to
keep
the
western
lion
from
breaking
loose
and
returning
home
in
disgust
while
they
desired
to
get
the
best
treaty
they
could
rather
than
no
treaty
at
all
gradually
the
british
commissioners
abated
their
demands
and
gave
up
all
territorial
and
fishery
claims
and
on
december
concluded
the
negotiations
on
the
basis
of
things
before
the
war
the
quo
ante
clay
was
deeply
chagrined
he
signed
the
document
with
great
reluctance
and
always
spoke
of
it
as
a
damned
bad
treaty
since
it
made
no
allusion
to
the
grievance
which
provoked
the
war
which
he
had
so
eloquently
advocated
gallatin
and
clay
spent
some
time
in
paris
and
most
of
the
ensuing
summer
in
london
on
further
negotiations
of
details
but
clay
had
no
sooner
returned
to
lexington
than
he
was
to
the
national
legislature
where
he
was
again
chosen
speaker
december
having
declined
the
russian
mission
and
the
more
tempting
post
of
the
secretary
of
war
he
justly
felt
that
his
arena
was
the
house
of
representatives
which
as
well
as
the
senate
had
a
republican
majority
it
was
his
mission
to
make
speeches
and
pull
political
wires
and
not
perplex
himself
with
the
details
of
office
which
required
more
executive
ability
and
better
business
habits
than
he
possessed
and
which
would
seriously
interfere
with
his
social
life
how
could
he
play
cards
all
night
if
he
was
obliged
to
be
at
his
office
at
ten
in
the
morning
day
after
day
superintending
clerks
and
doing
work
which
to
him
was
drudgery
much
more
pleasant
to
him
was
it
to
preside
over
stormy
debates
appoint
important
committees
write
letters
to
friends
and
occasionally
address
the
house
in
committee
of
the
whole
when
his
voice
would
sway
the
passions
of
his
intelligent
listeners
for
he
had
the
power
to
move
to
pity
and
excite
to
rage
besides
all
this
there
were
questions
to
be
discussed
and
settled
by
congress
important
to
the
public
and
very
interesting
to
politicians
the
war
had
bequeathed
a
debt
to
provide
for
its
payment
taxes
must
be
imposed
but
all
taxation
is
unpopular
the
problem
was
to
make
taxes
as
easy
as
possible
should
they
be
direct
or
indirect
should
they
be
imposed
for
a
revenue
only
or
to
stimulate
and
protect
infant
manufactures
the
country
was
expanding
should
there
be
national
provision
for
internal
improvements
roads
canals
there
were
questions
about
the
currency
about
commerce
about
the
indians
about
education
about
foreign
relations
about
the
territories
which
demanded
the
attention
of
congress
the
most
important
of
these
were
those
connected
with
revenues
and
tariffs
it
was
this
latter
question
connected
with
internal
improvements
and
the
sales
of
public
lands
in
which
clay
was
most
interested
and
which
more
than
any
other
brought
out
and
developed
his
genius
he
is
generally
quoted
as
the
father
of
the
protective
policy
to
develop
american
manufactures
the
genius
of
hamilton
had
been
directed
to
the
best
way
to
raise
a
revenue
for
a
new
and
impoverished
country
that
of
clay
sought
to
secure
independence
of
those
foreign
products
which
go
so
far
to
enrich
nations
webster
when
reproached
for
his
change
of
views
respecting
tariffs
is
said
to
have
coolly
remarked
that
when
he
advocated
the
shipping
interest
he
represented
a
great
commercial
city
and
when
he
afterwards
advocated
tariffs
he
spoke
as
the
representative
of
a
manufacturing
state
a
sophistical
reply
which
showed
that
he
was
more
desirous
of
popularity
with
his
constituents
than
of
being
the
advocate
of
abstract
truth
calhoun
advocated
the
new
tariff
as
a
means
to
advance
the
cotton
interests
of
the
south
and
the
defence
of
the
country
in
time
of
war
thus
neither
of
the
great
political
leaders
had
in
view
national
interests
but
only
sectional
except
clay
whose
policy
was
more
and
here
began
his
great
career
as
a
statesman
before
this
he
was
rather
a
politician
greedy
of
popularity
and
desirous
to
make
friends
the
war
of
had
by
shutting
out
foreign
products
stimulated
certain
manufactures
difficult
to
import
but
necessary
for
military
operations
like
cheap
clothing
for
soldiers
blankets
gunpowder
and
certain
other
articles
for
general
use
especially
such
as
are
made
of
iron
when
the
war
closed
and
the
ports
opened
the
country
received
a
great
inflow
of
british
products
hence
the
tariff
of
the
earliest
for
protection
imposed
a
tax
of
about
per
cent
on
articles
for
which
the
home
industry
was
unable
to
supply
the
demand
and
twenty
per
cent
on
coarse
fabrics
of
cotton
and
wool
distilled
spirits
and
iron
while
those
industries
which
were
in
small
demand
were
admitted
free
or
paid
a
mere
revenue
tax
this
tariff
substantially
proposed
by
george
dallas
secretary
of
the
treasury
was
ably
supported
by
clay
but
his
mind
was
not
yet
fully
opened
to
the
magnitude
and
consequences
of
this
measure
his
chief
arguments
being
based
on
the
safety
of
the
country
in
time
of
war
in
this
movement
he
joined
hands
with
calhoun
one
of
his
warmest
friends
and
one
from
whose
greater
logical
genius
he
perhaps
drew
his
conclusions
at
that
time
party
lines
were
not
distinctly
drawn
the
old
federalists
had
lost
their
prestige
and
power
the
republicans
were
in
a
great
majority
even
john
quincy
adams
and
his
friends
swelled
their
ranks
jefferson
had
lost
much
of
his
interest
in
politics
and
was
cultivating
his
estates
and
building
up
the
university
of
virginia
madison
was
anticipating
the
pleasures
of
private
life
and
monroe
a
plain
noncommittal
man
the
last
of
the
virginia
dynasty
thought
only
of
following
the
footsteps
of
his
illustrious
predecessors
and
living
in
peace
with
all
men
the
next
important
movement
in
congress
was
in
reference
to
the
charter
of
the
newly
proposed
second
united
states
bank
and
in
this
the
great
influence
of
clay
was
felt
he
was
in
favor
of
it
as
a
necessity
in
view
of
the
miserable
state
of
the
finances
the
suspension
of
specie
payments
and
the
multiplication
of
state
banks
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
career
in
he
had
opposed
a
recharter
of
hamilton
national
bank
as
a
dangerous
and
withal
unconstitutional
on
the
ground
that
the
general
government
had
no
power
to
charter
companies
all
this
was
in
accordance
with
western
democracy
ever
jealous
of
the
and
the
theorizing
proclivities
of
jefferson
who
pretended
to
hate
everything
which
was
supported
in
the
old
country
but
with
advancing
light
and
the
experience
of
depreciated
currency
from
the
multiplication
of
state
banks
clay
had
changed
his
views
exposing
himself
to
the
charge
of
inconsistency
which
however
he
met
with
engaging
candor
claiming
rather
credit
for
his
ability
and
willingness
to
see
the
change
of
public
needs
he
now
therefore
supported
the
bill
of
calhoun
which
created
a
national
bank
with
a
capital
of
million
dollars
substantially
such
as
was
proposed
by
hamilton
the
charter
was
finally
given
in
april
to
run
for
twenty
years
doubtless
such
a
great
great
for
those
times
did
wield
a
political
influence
and
it
might
have
been
better
if
the
bank
had
been
chartered
with
a
smaller
capital
it
would
have
created
fewer
enemies
and
might
have
escaped
the
future
wrath
of
general
jackson
webster
at
first
opposed
the
bill
of
calhoun
but
when
it
was
afterwards
seen
that
the
bank
as
created
as
an
advantage
to
the
country
he
became
one
of
its
strongest
supporters
webster
was
strongly
conservative
by
nature
but
when
anything
was
established
like
lord
thurlow
he
ceased
all
opposition
especially
if
it
worked
well
in
james
monroe
was
elected
president
and
clay
expected
to
be
made
secretary
of
state
as
a
step
to
the
presidency
which
he
now
ardently
desired
but
he
was
disappointed
john
quincy
adams
being
chosen
by
monroe
as
secretary
of
state
monroe
offered
to
clay
the
mission
to
england
and
the
department
of
war
both
of
which
he
declined
preferring
the
speakership
to
which
he
was
almost
unanimously
here
clay
brought
his
influence
to
bear
in
opposition
to
the
views
of
the
administration
to
promote
internal
improvements
to
which
some
objected
on
constitutional
grounds
but
which
he
defended
both
as
a
statesman
and
a
western
man
the
result
was
a
debate
ending
in
a
resolution
that
congress
has
power
under
the
constitution
to
appropriate
money
for
the
construction
of
post
roads
military
and
other
roads
and
of
canals
for
the
improvement
of
meanwhile
a
subject
of
far
greater
interest
called
out
the
best
energies
of
clay
the
beginning
of
a
memorable
struggle
even
the
agitation
of
the
slavery
question
which
was
not
to
end
until
all
the
slaves
in
the
united
states
were
emancipated
by
a
single
stroke
of
abraham
lincoln
pen
so
long
as
the
products
of
slave
labor
were
unprofitable
through
the
exhaustion
of
the
there
was
a
sort
of
sentimental
philanthropy
among
disinterested
southern
men
tending
to
a
partial
emancipation
but
when
the
cotton
gin
invented
in
had
trebled
the
value
of
slaves
and
the
breeding
of
them
became
a
profitable
industry
the
philanthropy
of
the
planters
vanished
the
english
demand
for
american
cotton
grew
rapidly
and
in
francis
lowell
established
cotton
manufactures
in
new
england
so
that
cotton
leaped
into
great
importance
thus
the
south
had
now
become
jealous
of
interference
with
its
favorite
institution
in
an
address
in
manchester
england
october
the
first
of
that
tremendous
series
of
speeches
with
which
henry
ward
beecher
put
a
check
on
the
english
government
by
convincing
the
english
people
of
the
righteousness
of
the
federal
cause
during
our
civil
war
that
as
oliver
wendell
holmes
called
him
gave
a
witty
summary
of
this
change
after
showing
that
the
great
fathers
of
revolutionary
times
and
notably
the
great
southerners
were
antislavery
men
that
the
first
abolition
society
was
formed
in
the
middle
and
border
states
and
not
in
the
northeast
and
that
emancipation
was
enacted
by
the
eastern
and
middle
states
as
a
natural
consequence
of
the
growth
of
that
sentiment
the
orator
said
what
was
it
then
when
the
country
had
advanced
so
far
towards
universal
emancipation
in
the
period
of
our
national
formation
that
stopped
this
onward
tide
first
the
wonderful
demand
for
cotton
throughout
the
world
precisely
when
from
the
invention
of
the
cotton
gin
it
became
easy
to
turn
it
to
service
slaves
that
before
had
been
worth
from
three
to
four
hundred
dollars
began
to
be
worth
six
hundred
dollars
that
knocked
away
one
third
of
adherence
to
the
moral
law
then
they
became
worth
seven
hundred
dollars
and
half
the
law
went
then
eight
or
nine
hundred
dollars
and
there
was
no
such
thing
as
moral
law
then
one
thousand
or
twelve
hundred
dollars
and
slavery
became
one
of
the
beatitudes
therefore
when
in
the
territory
of
missouri
applied
for
admission
to
the
union
as
a
state
the
south
was
greatly
excited
by
the
proposition
from
tallmadge
of
new
york
that
its
admission
should
be
conditioned
upon
the
prohibition
of
slavery
within
its
limits
it
was
a
revelation
to
the
people
of
the
north
that
so
bitter
a
feeling
should
be
aroused
by
opposition
to
the
extension
of
an
acknowledged
evil
which
had
been
abolished
in
all
their
own
states
the
southern
leaders
on
their
side
maintained
that
congress
could
not
under
the
constitution
legislate
on
such
a
subject
that
it
was
a
matter
for
the
states
alone
to
decide
and
that
slavery
was
essential
to
the
prosperity
of
the
southern
states
as
white
men
could
not
labor
in
the
cotton
and
rice
fields
the
northern
orators
maintained
that
not
only
had
the
right
of
congress
to
exclude
slavery
from
the
territories
been
generally
admitted
but
that
it
was
a
demoralizing
institution
and
more
injurious
to
the
whites
even
than
to
the
blacks
the
southern
leaders
became
furiously
agitated
and
threatened
to
secede
from
the
union
rather
than
submit
to
northern
dictation
while
at
the
north
the
state
legislatures
demanded
the
exclusion
of
slaves
from
missouri
carl
schurz
in
his
admirable
life
of
clay
makes
a
pertinent
summary
the
slaveholders
watched
with
apprehension
the
steady
growth
of
the
free
states
in
population
wealth
and
power
as
the
slaveholders
had
no
longer
the
ultimate
extinction
but
now
the
perpetuation
of
slavery
in
view
the
question
of
sectional
power
became
one
of
first
importance
to
them
and
with
it
the
necessity
of
having
more
slave
states
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
political
equilibrium
at
least
in
the
senate
a
struggle
for
more
slave
states
was
to
them
a
struggle
for
life
thus
the
two
elements
of
commercial
profit
and
political
power
were
involved
in
the
struggle
of
the
south
for
the
maintenance
and
extension
of
slavery
the
house
of
representatives
in
adopted
the
missouri
bill
with
the
amendment
restricting
slavery
but
the
senate
did
not
concur
and
alabama
was
admitted
as
a
territory
without
slavery
restriction
in
the
next
congress
missouri
was
again
introduced
but
the
antislavery
amendment
was
voted
down
in
thomas
a
senator
from
illinois
proposed
as
a
mutual
concession
that
missouri
should
be
admitted
without
restriction
but
that
in
all
that
part
of
the
territory
outside
that
state
ceded
by
france
to
the
united
states
north
of
the
latitude
of
the
southern
boundary
of
missouri
slaves
should
thereafter
be
excluded
and
this
bill
was
finally
passed
march
clay
is
credited
with
being
the
father
of
this
compromise
but
according
to
schurz
he
did
not
deserve
the
honor
he
adopted
it
however
and
advocated
it
with
so
much
eloquence
and
power
that
it
owed
its
success
largely
to
his
efforts
and
therefore
it
is
still
generally
ascribed
to
him
at
that
time
no
statesmen
north
or
south
had
fully
grasped
the
slavery
question
even
calhoun
once
seemed
to
have
no
doubt
as
to
the
authority
of
congress
to
exclude
slavery
from
the
territories
but
he
was
decided
enough
in
his
opposition
when
he
saw
that
it
involved
an
irreconcilable
conflict
of
interests
that
slavery
and
freedom
are
antagonistic
ideas
concerning
which
there
can
be
no
genuine
compromise
there
may
be
compromises
says
von
holst
with
regard
to
measures
but
never
between
principles
and
slavery
when
the
missouri
compromise
was
started
was
looked
upon
as
a
measure
rather
than
as
a
principle
concerning
which
few
statesmen
had
thought
deeply
as
the
agitation
increased
measures
were
lost
sight
of
in
principles
the
compromise
by
which
missouri
was
admitted
as
a
slave
state
while
slavery
should
be
excluded
from
all
territory
outside
of
it
north
of
was
a
temporary
measure
of
expediency
and
at
that
period
was
probably
a
wise
one
since
if
slavery
had
been
excluded
from
missouri
there
might
have
been
a
dissolution
of
the
union
the
preservation
of
the
union
was
the
dearest
object
to
the
heart
of
clay
who
was
genuinely
and
thoroughly
patriotic
herein
he
doubtless
rendered
a
great
public
service
and
proved
himself
to
be
a
statesman
to
effect
this
compromise
clay
had
put
forth
all
his
energies
not
only
in
eloquent
speeches
and
tireless
labors
in
committees
and
a
series
of
parliamentary
devices
for
harmonizing
the
strife
but
in
innumerable
interviews
with
individuals
in
clay
retired
to
private
life
in
order
to
retrieve
his
fortunes
by
practice
at
the
bar
few
men
without
either
a
professional
or
a
private
income
can
afford
a
public
service
although
the
members
of
congress
were
paid
the
pay
was
not
large
enough
only
eight
dollars
a
day
at
that
time
but
clay
interval
of
rest
was
soon
cut
short
in
three
years
he
was
again
elected
to
the
house
of
representatives
and
in
december
was
promptly
chosen
speaker
by
a
large
majority
he
had
now
recovered
his
popularity
and
was
generally
spoken
of
as
the
great
pacificator
in
congress
his
voice
was
heard
again
in
defence
of
internal
improvements
the
making
of
roads
and
canals
president
monroe
having
vetoed
a
bill
favoring
them
on
the
ground
that
it
was
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
vote
money
for
them
clay
however
succeeded
in
inducing
congress
to
make
an
appropriation
for
a
survey
of
such
roads
as
might
be
deemed
of
national
importance
which
monroe
did
not
oppose
it
was
ever
of
vital
necessity
in
the
eyes
of
clay
to
open
up
the
west
to
settlers
from
the
east
and
he
gloried
in
the
prospect
of
the
indefinite
expanse
of
the
country
even
to
the
pacific
ocean
sir
said
he
in
the
debate
on
this
question
it
is
a
subject
of
peculiar
delight
to
me
to
look
forward
to
the
proud
and
happy
period
distant
as
it
may
be
when
circulation
and
association
between
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
and
the
mexican
gulf
shall
be
as
free
and
perfect
as
they
are
at
this
moment
in
england
the
most
highly
improved
country
on
the
globe
sir
a
new
world
has
come
into
being
since
the
constitution
was
adopted
are
we
to
neglect
and
refuse
the
redemption
of
that
vast
wilderness
which
once
stretched
unbroken
beyond
the
alleghany
in
these
views
he
proved
himself
one
of
the
most
statesmen
that
had
as
yet
appeared
in
congress
a
typical
western
man
of
enthusiasm
and
boundless
hope
not
less
enthusiastic
was
he
in
his
open
expressions
of
sympathy
with
the
greek
struggle
for
liberty
as
was
the
case
also
with
daniel
webster
both
advocating
relief
to
the
greeks
not
merely
from
sentiment
but
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
holy
alliance
of
european
kingdoms
then
bent
on
extinguishing
liberty
in
every
country
in
europe
clay
noble
speech
in
defence
of
the
greeks
was
not
however
received
with
unanimous
admiration
since
many
members
of
congress
were
fearful
of
entangling
the
united
states
in
european
disputes
and
wars
and
the
movement
came
to
naught
then
followed
the
great
debates
which
led
to
the
famous
tariff
of
in
which
clay
although
speaker
of
the
house
took
a
prominent
part
in
committee
of
the
whole
advocating
an
increase
of
duties
for
the
protection
of
american
manufactures
of
iron
hemp
glass
lead
wool
woollen
and
cotton
goods
while
duties
on
importations
which
did
not
interfere
with
american
manufactures
were
to
be
left
on
a
mere
revenue
basis
this
tariff
had
become
necessary
as
he
thought
in
view
of
the
prevailing
distress
produced
by
dependence
on
foreign
markets
he
would
provide
a
home
consumption
for
american
manufactures
and
thus
develop
home
industries
which
could
be
done
only
by
imposing
import
taxes
that
should
protect
them
against
foreign
competition
his
speech
on
what
he
called
the
american
system
was
one
of
the
most
elaborate
he
ever
made
and
carl
schurz
says
of
it
that
his
skill
of
statement
his
ingenuity
in
the
grouping
of
facts
and
principles
his
plausibility
of
reasoning
his
brilliant
imagination
the
fervor
of
his
diction
the
warm
patriotic
tone
of
his
appeals
presented
the
arguments
which
were
current
among
men
then
and
which
remain
so
still
while
on
the
other
hand
his
superficial
research
his
habit
of
satisfying
himself
with
and
his
disinclination
to
reason
out
propositions
logically
in
all
their
consequences
gave
incompleteness
to
his
otherwise
brilliant
effort
it
made
a
great
impression
in
spite
of
its
weak
points
and
called
out
in
opposition
the
extraordinary
abilities
of
daniel
webster
through
whose
massive
sentences
appeared
his
superiority
in
keenness
of
analysis
in
logical
reasoning
in
extent
and
accuracy
of
knowledge
in
reach
of
thought
and
mastery
of
fundamental
principles
over
all
the
other
speakers
of
the
day
and
this
speech
of
webster
stands
unanswered
notwithstanding
the
opposite
views
he
himself
maintained
four
years
afterwards
when
he
spoke
again
on
the
tariff
but
representing
manufacturing
interests
rather
than
those
of
shipping
and
commerce
advocating
expediency
rather
than
abstract
principles
the
truth
of
which
can
not
be
gainsaid
the
bill
as
supported
by
clay
passed
by
a
small
majority
the
members
from
the
south
generally
voting
against
it
after
the
tariff
of
the
new
england
states
went
extensively
into
manufacturing
and
the
middle
states
also
the
protective
idea
had
become
popular
in
the
north
and
under
strong
protests
from
the
agricultural
south
in
a
new
tariff
bill
was
enacted
largely
on
the
principle
of
giving
more
protection
to
every
interest
that
asked
for
it
this
called
by
its
opponents
the
tariff
of
abominations
was
passed
while
clay
was
secretary
of
state
the
discontent
under
it
was
to
give
rise
to
southern
nullification
and
to
afford
clay
another
opportunity
to
act
as
pacificator
all
this
tariff
war
is
set
forth
in
clear
detail
in
professor
sumner
life
of
jackson
this
question
of
tariffs
has
for
seventy
years
now
been
the
great
issue
next
to
slavery
between
the
north
and
south
more
debates
have
taken
place
on
this
question
than
on
any
other
in
our
congressional
history
and
it
still
remains
unsettled
like
most
other
questions
of
political
economy
the
warfare
has
been
constant
and
uninterrupted
between
those
who
argue
subjects
from
abstract
truths
and
those
who
look
at
local
interests
and
maintain
that
all
political
questions
should
be
determined
by
circumstances
when
it
seemed
to
be
the
interest
of
great
britain
to
advocate
protection
for
her
varied
products
protection
was
the
policy
of
the
government
when
it
became
evidently
for
her
interest
to
defend
free
trade
then
free
trade
became
the
law
of
parliament
on
abstract
grounds
there
is
little
dispute
on
the
question
if
all
the
world
acted
on
the
principles
of
free
trade
protection
would
be
indefensible
practically
it
is
a
matter
of
local
interest
it
is
the
interest
of
new
england
to
secure
protection
for
its
varied
industries
and
to
secure
free
raw
materials
for
manufacture
it
is
the
interest
of
agricultural
states
to
buy
wares
in
the
cheapest
market
and
to
seek
foreign
markets
for
their
surplus
breadstuffs
the
question
however
on
broad
grounds
is
whether
protection
is
or
is
not
for
the
interest
of
the
whole
country
and
on
that
point
there
are
differences
of
opinion
among
both
politicians
and
statesmen
formerly
few
discussed
the
subject
on
abstract
principles
except
college
professors
and
doctrinaires
but
it
is
a
most
momentous
subject
from
a
material
point
of
view
and
the
great
scale
on
which
protection
has
been
tried
in
america
since
the
civil
war
has
produced
a
multiplicity
of
consequences
industrial
and
economic
which
have
set
up
discussions
of
both
principles
and
practical
applications
how
it
will
be
finally
settled
no
one
can
predict
perhaps
through
a
series
of
compromises
with
ever
lessening
restriction
until
the
millennial
dream
of
universal
free
trade
shall
become
practicable
protection
has
good
points
and
bad
ones
while
it
stimulates
manufactures
it
also
creates
monopolies
and
widens
the
distinctions
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
disproportionate
fortunes
were
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
and
are
a
grave
danger
to
our
modern
civilization
but
then
it
is
difficult
to
point
out
any
period
in
the
history
of
civilization
when
disproportionate
fortunes
did
not
exist
except
in
primitive
agricultural
states
in
the
enjoyment
of
personal
liberty
like
switzerland
and
new
england
one
hundred
years
ago
they
certainly
existed
in
feudal
europe
as
they
do
in
england
the
great
cotton
lords
are
feudal
barons
under
another
name
where
money
is
worshipped
there
will
be
who
in
vulgar
pride
and
power
rival
the
worst
specimens
of
an
hereditary
nobility
there
is
really
little
that
is
new
in
human
organizations
little
that
solomon
and
aristotle
had
not
learned
when
we
go
to
the
foundation
of
society
it
is
the
same
story
in
all
ages
and
countries
most
that
is
new
is
superficial
and
transitory
the
permanent
is
eternally
based
on
the
certitudes
of
life
which
are
moral
and
intellectual
rather
than
mechanical
and
material
whatever
promotes
these
certitudes
is
the
highest
political
wisdom
we
now
turn
to
contemplate
the
beginnings
of
clay
aspirations
to
the
presidency
which
from
this
time
never
left
him
until
he
had
one
foot
in
the
grave
as
a
successful
popular
and
ambitious
man
who
had
already
rendered
important
services
we
can
not
wonder
that
he
sought
the
envied
prize
who
in
the
nation
was
more
eminent
than
he
but
such
a
consummation
of
ambition
is
not
attained
by
merit
alone
he
had
enemies
and
he
had
powerful
rivals
in
john
quincy
adams
as
monroe
secretary
of
state
was
in
the
line
of
promotion
a
statesman
of
experience
and
abilities
the
superior
of
clay
in
learning
who
had
spent
his
life
in
the
public
service
and
in
honorable
positions
especially
as
a
foreign
minister
he
belonged
to
the
reigning
party
and
was
the
choice
of
new
england
moreover
he
had
the
prestige
of
a
great
name
he
was
it
is
true
far
from
popular
was
cold
and
severe
in
manners
and
irritable
in
temperament
but
he
was
patriotic
incorruptible
lofty
in
sentiment
and
unstained
by
vices
andrew
jackson
was
also
a
formidable
competitor
a
military
hero
the
idol
of
the
west
and
a
man
of
extraordinary
force
of
character
with
undoubted
executive
abilities
but
without
much
experience
in
civil
affairs
despotic
in
temper
and
unscrupulous
crawford
of
georgia
secretary
of
the
treasury
with
great
southern
prestige
and
an
adroit
politician
was
also
a
candidate
superior
to
all
these
candidates
in
political
genius
was
calhoun
of
south
carolina
not
yet
so
prominent
as
he
afterwards
became
the
popular
choice
in
lay
between
jackson
and
adams
and
as
no
candidate
obtained
a
majority
of
the
electoral
votes
the
election
reverted
to
the
house
of
representatives
and
adams
was
chosen
much
to
the
chagrin
of
jackson
who
had
the
largest
number
of
popular
votes
and
the
disappointment
of
clay
who
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
it
when
the
latter
saw
that
his
own
chances
were
small
however
he
had
thrown
his
influence
in
favor
of
adams
securing
his
election
and
became
his
secretary
of
state
jackson
was
indignant
as
he
felt
he
had
been
robbed
of
the
prize
by
a
secret
bargain
or
coalition
between
clay
and
adams
in
retiring
from
the
speakership
of
the
house
which
he
had
held
so
long
clay
received
the
formal
and
hearty
thanks
of
that
body
for
his
undeniably
distinguished
services
as
presiding
officer
in
knowledge
of
parliamentary
law
and
tactics
in
prompt
decisions
never
once
overruled
in
all
his
long
career
in
fairness
courtesy
and
control
of
the
house
at
the
stormiest
times
he
certainly
never
had
a
superior
friends
and
enemies
alike
recognized
and
cordially
expressed
their
sense
of
his
masterly
abilities
the
administration
of
adams
was
not
eventful
but
to
his
credit
he
made
only
four
removals
from
office
during
his
term
of
service
and
these
for
good
cause
he
followed
out
the
policy
of
his
predecessors
even
under
pressure
from
his
cabinet
refusing
to
recognize
either
friends
or
enemies
as
such
but
simply
holding
public
officers
to
their
duty
so
too
in
his
foreign
policy
which
was
conservative
and
prudent
and
free
from
entangling
alliances
at
a
time
when
the
struggle
for
independence
among
the
south
american
republics
presented
an
occasion
for
interference
and
when
the
debates
on
the
panama
mission
a
proposed
council
of
south
and
central
american
republics
at
panama
to
which
the
united
states
were
invited
to
send
representatives
were
embarrassing
to
the
executive
the
services
of
clay
as
secretary
of
state
were
not
distinguished
he
made
a
number
of
satisfactory
treaties
with
foreign
powers
and
exhibited
great
catholicity
of
mind
but
he
was
embroiled
in
quarrels
and
disputes
anything
but
glorious
and
he
further
found
his
situation
irksome
his
field
was
the
legislature
as
an
executive
officer
he
was
out
of
place
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
would
have
made
as
good
a
president
as
many
inferior
politicians
he
detested
office
labor
and
was
sensitive
to
hostile
criticism
his
acceptance
of
the
office
of
secretary
of
state
was
probably
a
blunder
as
his
appointment
was
though
unjustly
thought
by
many
to
be
in
fulfilment
of
a
bargain
and
it
did
not
advance
his
popularity
he
was
subject
to
slanders
and
misrepresentations
the
secretaryship
instead
of
being
a
step
to
the
presidency
was
thus
rather
an
impediment
in
his
way
it
was
not
even
a
position
of
as
much
power
as
the
speakership
it
gave
him
no
excitement
and
did
not
keep
him
before
the
eyes
of
the
people
his
health
failed
he
even
thought
of
resignation
the
supporters
of
the
adams
administration
those
who
more
and
more
came
to
rank
themselves
as
promoters
of
tariffs
and
internal
improvements
with
liberal
views
as
to
the
constitutional
powers
of
the
national
government
gradually
consolidated
in
opposition
to
the
party
headed
by
jackson
the
former
called
themselves
national
republicans
and
the
latter
democratic
republicans
during
the
jacksonian
administrations
they
became
known
more
simply
as
whigs
and
democrats
on
the
accession
of
general
jackson
to
the
presidency
in
clay
retired
to
his
farm
at
ashland
but
while
he
amused
himself
by
raising
fine
cattle
and
horses
and
straightening
out
his
embarrassed
finances
he
was
still
the
recognized
leader
of
the
national
republican
party
he
was
then
years
of
age
at
his
very
best
and
strongest
period
he
took
more
interest
in
politics
than
in
agriculture
or
in
literary
matters
he
was
not
a
learned
man
nor
a
great
reader
but
a
close
observer
of
men
and
of
all
political
movements
he
was
a
great
favorite
and
received
perpetual
ovations
whenever
he
travelled
always
ready
to
make
speeches
at
public
meetings
which
were
undoubtedly
eloquent
and
instructive
but
not
masterpieces
like
those
of
webster
at
plymouth
and
bunker
hill
they
were
not
rich
in
fundamental
principles
of
government
and
political
science
and
far
from
being
elaborate
but
were
earnest
patriotic
and
impassioned
clay
was
fearless
ingenuous
and
chivalric
and
won
the
hearts
of
the
people
which
webster
failed
to
do
both
were
great
debaters
the
one
appealing
to
the
understanding
and
the
other
to
popular
sentiments
webster
was
cold
massive
logical
although
occasionally
illuminating
his
argument
with
a
grand
glow
of
eloquence
the
admiration
of
lawyers
and
clergymen
clay
was
the
delight
of
the
common
people
impulsive
electrical
brilliant
calling
out
the
sympathies
of
his
hearers
and
captivating
them
by
his
obvious
sincerity
and
frankness
not
so
much
convincing
them
as
moving
them
and
stimulating
them
to
action
webster
rarely
lost
his
temper
but
he
could
be
terribly
sarcastic
harsh
and
even
fierce
clay
was
passionate
and
irritable
but
forgiving
and
generous
loath
to
lose
a
friend
and
eager
for
popularity
webster
seemed
indifferent
to
applause
and
even
to
ordinary
friendship
proud
and
clay
was
vain
and
susceptible
to
flattery
no
stranger
could
approach
webster
but
clay
was
as
accessible
as
a
primitive
bishop
new
england
was
proud
of
webster
but
the
west
loved
clay
kentucky
would
follow
her
favorite
to
the
last
whatever
mistakes
he
might
make
but
massachusetts
deserted
webster
when
he
failed
to
respond
to
her
popular
convictions
both
men
were
disappointed
in
the
prize
they
sought
one
because
he
was
not
loved
by
the
people
colossal
as
they
admitted
him
to
be
a
frowning
jupiter
tonans
absorbed
in
his
own
majesty
the
other
because
he
had
incurred
the
hatred
of
jackson
and
other
party
chiefs
who
were
envious
of
his
popularity
and
fearful
of
his
ascendency
the
hatred
which
clay
and
jackson
had
for
each
other
was
inexorable
it
steeped
them
both
in
bitterness
and
uncompromising
opposition
they
were
rivals
the
heads
of
their
respective
parties
clay
regarded
jackson
as
an
ignorant
despotic
unscrupulous
military
chieftain
who
had
been
raised
to
power
by
the
blind
adoration
of
military
success
while
jackson
looked
upon
clay
as
an
intriguing
politician
without
honesty
industry
or
consistency
gifted
only
in
their
quarrels
and
mutual
abuse
formed
no
small
part
of
the
political
history
of
the
country
during
jackson
administration
and
have
received
from
historians
more
attention
than
they
deserved
colton
takes
up
about
one
half
of
his
first
volume
of
the
life
of
clay
in
dismal
documents
which
few
care
about
relating
to
what
he
calls
the
great
conspiracy
that
is
the
intrigues
of
politicians
to
rob
clay
of
his
rights
the
miserable
party
warfare
which
raged
so
furiously
and
blindly
from
to
i
need
not
here
dwell
on
the
contentions
and
slanders
and
hatreds
which
were
so
prominent
at
the
time
the
two
great
national
parties
were
formed
and
which
divided
the
country
until
the
civil
war
the
most
notable
portion
of
henry
clay
life
was
his
great
career
as
senator
in
congress
which
he
entered
in
december
two
years
after
the
inauguration
of
president
jackson
the
first
subject
of
national
importance
to
which
he
gave
his
attention
was
the
one
with
which
his
name
and
fame
are
mostly
identified
the
tariff
to
a
moderate
form
of
which
the
president
in
had
announced
himself
to
be
favorable
but
which
he
afterwards
more
and
more
opposed
on
the
ground
that
the
revenues
already
produced
were
in
excess
of
the
needs
of
the
government
the
subject
was
ably
discussed
first
in
a
resolution
introduced
by
senator
clay
declarative
of
principles
involving
some
reduction
of
duties
on
articles
that
did
not
compete
with
american
industries
but
maintaining
generally
the
american
system
successfully
introduced
by
him
in
the
tariff
of
and
then
in
a
bill
framed
in
accordance
with
the
resolution
both
of
which
were
passed
in
clay
speeches
on
this
tariff
of
were
among
the
strongest
and
ablest
he
ever
delivered
indeed
he
apparently
exhausted
his
subject
little
has
been
added
by
political
economists
to
the
arguments
for
protection
since
his
day
his
main
points
were
that
it
was
beneficial
to
all
parts
of
the
union
and
absolutely
necessary
to
much
the
largest
portion
that
the
price
of
cotton
and
of
other
agricultural
products
had
been
sustained
and
a
decline
averted
by
the
protective
system
that
even
if
the
foreign
demand
for
cotton
had
been
diminished
by
the
operation
of
this
system
the
plea
of
the
southern
leaders
the
diminution
had
been
more
than
compensated
in
the
additional
demand
created
at
home
that
the
competition
produced
by
the
system
reduces
the
price
of
manufactured
articles
for
which
he
adduced
his
facts
and
finally
that
the
policy
of
free
trade
without
benefiting
any
section
of
the
union
would
by
subjecting
us
to
foreign
legislation
regulated
by
foreign
interests
lead
to
the
prostration
and
ruin
of
our
manufactories
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
speech
was
made
in
before
our
manufactures
really
infant
industries
could
compete
successfully
with
foreigners
in
anything
at
the
present
time
there
are
many
interests
which
need
no
protection
at
all
and
the
protection
of
these
interests
as
a
matter
of
course
fosters
monopolies
and
hence
the
progress
which
is
continually
being
made
in
manufactures
enabling
this
country
to
be
independent
of
foreign
industries
makes
protective
duties
on
many
articles
undesirable
now
which
were
expedient
and
even
necessary
sixty
years
ago
an
illustration
of
the
fallacy
of
tariffs
founded
on
immutable
principles
when
they
are
simply
matters
of
expediency
according
to
the
changing
interests
of
nations
we
have
already
in
the
lecture
on
jackson
described
the
nullification
episode
with
the
threatening
protests
against
the
tariff
of
and
its
amendments
of
jackson
prompt
action
and
clay
patriotic
and
earnest
efforts
resulting
in
the
compromise
tariff
of
march
by
this
bill
duties
were
to
be
gradually
reduced
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
webster
was
not
altogether
satisfied
nor
were
the
extreme
tariff
men
who
would
have
run
the
risks
of
the
threatened
nullification
by
south
carolina
it
proved
however
a
popular
measure
and
did
much
to
tranquillize
the
nation
yet
it
did
not
wholly
satisfy
the
south
nor
any
extreme
partisans
as
compromises
seldom
do
and
clay
lost
many
friends
in
consequence
a
result
which
he
anticipated
and
manfully
met
it
led
to
one
of
his
finest
bursts
of
eloquence
i
have
said
he
been
accused
of
ambition
in
presenting
this
measure
ambition
inordinate
ambition
low
grovelling
souls
who
are
utterly
incapable
of
elevating
themselves
to
the
higher
and
nobler
duties
of
pure
patriotism
beings
who
forever
keeping
their
own
selfish
aims
in
view
decide
all
public
measures
by
their
presumed
influence
on
their
own
aggrandizement
judge
me
by
the
venal
rule
which
they
prescribe
for
themselves
i
am
no
candidate
for
any
office
in
the
gift
of
these
states
united
or
separated
i
never
wish
never
expect
to
be
pass
this
bill
tranquillize
the
country
restore
confidence
and
affection
for
the
union
and
i
am
willing
to
go
to
ashland
and
renounce
public
service
forever
yes
i
have
ambition
but
it
is
the
ambition
of
being
the
humble
instrument
in
the
hands
of
providence
to
reconcile
a
divided
people
once
more
to
revive
concord
and
harmony
in
a
distracted
land
the
pleasing
ambition
of
contemplating
the
glorious
spectacle
of
a
free
united
prosperous
and
fraternal
people
the
policy
which
clay
advocated
with
so
much
ability
during
the
whole
of
his
congressional
life
was
that
manufactures
as
well
as
the
culture
of
rice
tobacco
and
cotton
would
enrich
this
country
and
therefore
ought
to
be
fostered
and
protected
by
congress
whatever
hayne
or
calhoun
should
say
to
the
contrary
or
even
general
jackson
himself
whose
sympathies
were
with
the
south
and
consequently
with
slavery
therefore
clay
is
called
the
father
of
the
american
system
he
was
the
advocate
not
of
any
local
interests
but
the
interests
of
the
country
as
a
whole
thus
establishing
his
claim
to
be
a
statesman
rather
than
a
politician
who
never
looks
beyond
local
and
transient
interests
and
is
especially
subservient
to
party
dictation
the
southern
politicians
may
not
have
wished
to
root
out
manufacturing
altogether
but
it
was
their
policy
to
keep
the
agricultural
interests
in
the
ascendent
soon
after
the
close
of
the
session
of
the
congress
clay
on
his
return
to
ashland
put
into
execution
a
project
he
had
long
contemplated
of
visiting
the
eastern
cities
at
that
period
even
an
excursion
of
one
thousand
miles
was
a
serious
affair
and
attended
with
great
discomfort
wherever
clay
went
he
was
received
with
enthusiasm
receptions
public
dinners
and
fêtes
succeeded
each
other
in
all
the
principal
cities
in
baltimore
in
wilmington
and
in
philadelphia
he
was
entertained
at
balls
and
banquets
in
new
york
he
was
the
guest
of
the
city
and
was
visited
by
thousands
eager
to
shake
his
hand
the
company
controlling
the
line
between
new
york
and
boston
tendered
to
him
the
use
of
one
of
their
fine
steamers
to
rhode
island
where
every
social
honor
was
publicly
given
him
in
boston
he
was
welcomed
by
a
committee
of
forty
in
behalf
of
the
young
men
headed
by
winthrop
and
was
received
by
a
committee
of
old
men
when
he
was
eloquently
addressed
by
william
sullivan
and
was
subsequently
waited
upon
by
the
mayor
and
aldermen
of
the
city
deputations
from
portland
and
portsmouth
besought
the
honor
of
a
visit
at
charlestown
on
bunker
hill
edward
everett
welcomed
him
in
behalf
of
the
city
and
pronounced
one
of
his
felicitous
speeches
at
faneuil
hall
a
delegation
of
young
men
presented
him
with
a
pair
of
silver
pitchers
he
was
even
dragged
to
lyceum
lectures
during
the
two
weeks
he
remained
in
boston
he
thence
proceeded
amid
public
demonstrations
to
worcester
springfield
hartford
northampton
pittsfield
troy
albany
and
back
again
to
new
york
the
of
newark
begged
his
acceptance
of
one
of
their
most
costly
carriages
for
the
use
of
his
wife
no
one
except
washington
lafayette
and
general
grant
ever
received
more
enthusiastic
ovations
in
new
england
all
in
recognition
of
his
services
as
a
statesman
without
his
having
reached
any
higher
position
than
that
of
senator
or
secretary
of
state
in
such
a
rapid
review
of
the
career
of
clay
as
we
are
obliged
to
make
it
is
impossible
to
enter
upon
the
details
of
political
movements
and
the
shifting
grounds
of
party
organizations
and
warfare
we
must
not
however
lose
sight
of
that
most
characteristic
element
of
public
life
his
perennial
candidature
for
the
presidency
we
have
already
seen
him
in
when
his
failure
was
evident
throwing
his
influence
into
the
scale
for
john
quincy
adams
in
as
secretary
of
state
he
could
not
be
a
rival
to
his
chief
and
so
escaped
the
whelming
overthrow
with
which
jackson
defeated
their
party
in
he
was
an
intensely
popular
candidate
of
the
national
republicans
especially
the
merchants
and
manufacturers
of
the
north
and
east
and
the
friends
of
the
united
states
bank
but
southern
hostility
to
his
tariff
principles
and
the
rally
of
the
people
in
support
of
jackson
war
on
moneyed
institutions
threw
him
out
again
in
notable
defeat
in
and
again
in
clay
was
prominent
before
the
conventions
of
the
whig
or
national
republican
party
but
other
interests
subordinated
his
claims
to
nomination
and
the
election
of
van
buren
by
the
democrats
in
and
of
harrison
by
the
whigs
in
kept
him
still
in
abeyance
in
clay
was
again
the
whig
candidate
the
chief
issue
being
the
admission
of
texas
but
he
was
defeated
by
polk
and
the
democrats
and
after
that
the
paramount
slavery
question
pushed
him
aside
and
he
dropped
out
of
the
race
the
bitter
war
which
clay
made
on
the
administration
of
general
jackson
especially
in
reference
to
the
united
states
bank
question
has
already
been
noticed
and
although
it
is
an
important
passage
in
his
history
i
must
pass
it
by
to
avoid
repetition
which
is
always
tedious
all
i
would
say
in
this
connection
is
that
clay
was
foremost
among
the
supporters
of
the
bank
and
opposed
not
only
the
removal
of
deposits
but
also
the
scheme
of
van
buren
that
followed
the
failure
to
maintain
the
bank
some
of
his
ablest
oratory
was
expended
in
the
unsuccessful
opposition
to
these
democratic
measures
in
came
the
bursting
of
the
which
had
turned
everybody
head
and
led
to
the
most
extravagant
speculations
high
prices
high
rents
and
lofty
expectations
in
all
parts
of
the
country
this
was
followed
of
course
by
the
commercial
crisis
the
general
distress
and
all
the
evils
which
clay
and
webster
had
predicted
but
to
which
the
government
of
van
buren
seemed
to
be
indifferent
while
enforcing
its
pet
schemes
against
all
the
settled
laws
of
trade
and
the
experiences
of
the
past
but
the
country
was
elastic
after
all
and
a
great
reaction
set
in
new
political
combinations
were
made
to
express
the
general
indignation
against
the
responsible
party
in
power
and
the
whig
party
arose
joined
by
many
leading
democrats
like
rives
of
virginia
and
tallmadge
of
new
york
while
calhoun
went
over
to
van
buren
and
dissolved
his
alliance
with
clay
which
in
reality
for
several
years
had
been
hollow
in
the
presidential
election
of
van
buren
was
defeated
by
an
overwhelming
majority
and
the
whigs
came
into
power
under
the
presidency
of
general
harrison
chosen
not
for
talents
or
services
but
for
his
availability
the
best
that
can
be
said
of
harrison
is
that
he
was
an
honest
man
he
was
a
small
farmer
in
ohio
with
no
definite
political
principles
but
had
gained
some
military
in
the
war
of
the
presidential
campaign
of
is
well
described
by
carl
schurz
as
a
popular
frolic
with
its
monster
with
raccoons
hard
cider
with
huge
picnics
and
ridiculous
doggerel
about
and
tyler
too
the
reason
why
it
called
out
so
great
enthusiasm
was
frivolous
enough
in
itself
but
it
expressed
the
popular
reaction
against
the
misrule
of
jackson
and
van
buren
which
had
plunged
the
country
into
financial
distress
notwithstanding
the
general
prosperity
which
existed
when
jackson
was
raised
to
power
a
lesson
to
all
future
presidents
who
set
up
their
own
will
against
the
collected
experience
and
wisdom
of
the
leading
intellects
of
the
country
president
harrison
offered
to
the
great
chieftain
of
the
whig
party
the
first
place
in
his
cabinet
which
he
declined
preferring
his
senatorial
dignity
and
power
besides
he
had
been
secretary
of
state
under
john
quincy
adams
and
found
the
office
irksome
he
knew
full
well
that
his
true
arena
was
the
senate
chamber
which
also
was
most
favorable
to
his
presidential
aspirations
but
webster
was
induced
to
take
the
office
declined
by
clay
having
for
his
associates
in
the
cabinet
such
able
men
as
ewing
badger
bell
crittenden
and
granger
clay
had
lost
no
time
when
congress
assembled
in
december
in
offering
a
resolution
for
the
repeal
of
the
act
but
as
the
democrats
had
still
a
majority
in
the
senate
the
resolution
failed
when
the
next
congress
assembled
general
harrison
having
lived
only
one
month
after
his
inauguration
and
the
john
tyler
having
succeeded
him
the
act
was
repealed
but
the
president
refused
to
give
his
signature
to
the
bill
for
the
of
the
united
states
bank
to
the
dismay
of
the
whigs
and
the
deep
disappointment
of
clay
who
at
once
severed
his
alliance
with
tyler
and
became
his
bitter
opponent
carrying
with
him
the
cabinet
which
resigned
with
the
exception
of
webster
who
was
engaged
in
important
negotiations
in
reference
to
the
northeastern
boundary
the
new
cabinet
was
made
up
of
tyler
personal
friends
who
had
been
jackson
democrats
and
the
fruits
of
the
great
whig
victory
were
therefore
in
a
measure
lost
the
democratic
party
gradually
regained
its
ascendency
which
it
retained
with
a
brief
interval
till
the
election
of
abraham
lincoln
a
question
greater
than
banks
and
tariffs
if
moral
questions
are
greater
than
material
ones
now
began
again
to
be
discussed
in
congress
ending
only
in
civil
war
this
was
the
slavery
question
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
missouri
compromise
of
which
clay
has
the
chief
credit
of
effecting
but
the
time
now
came
for
him
to
meet
the
question
on
other
grounds
the
abolitionists
through
the
constant
growth
of
the
antislavery
sentiment
throughout
the
north
had
become
a
power
and
demanded
that
slavery
should
be
abolished
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
here
again
i
feel
it
best
to
defer
what
i
have
to
say
on
antislavery
agitation
to
the
next
lecture
especially
as
clay
was
mixed
up
in
it
only
by
his
attempt
to
pour
oil
on
the
troubled
waters
he
himself
was
a
southerner
and
was
not
supposed
to
take
a
leading
part
in
the
conflict
although
opposed
to
slavery
on
philanthropic
grounds
without
being
an
abolitionist
he
dreaded
the
extension
of
the
yet
as
he
wished
to
be
president
he
was
afraid
of
losing
votes
and
did
not
wish
to
alienate
either
the
north
or
the
south
but
for
his
inordinate
desire
for
the
presidential
office
he
might
have
been
a
leader
in
the
antislavery
movement
all
his
sympathies
were
with
freedom
he
took
the
deepest
interest
in
colonization
and
was
president
of
the
colonization
society
which
had
for
its
aim
the
sending
of
manumitted
negroes
to
liberia
the
question
of
the
annexation
of
texas
forced
to
the
front
in
the
interest
of
the
slaveholding
states
united
the
democrats
and
elected
james
polk
president
in
while
clay
and
the
whig
party
who
confidently
expected
success
lost
the
election
by
reason
of
the
growth
of
the
antislavery
or
liberty
party
which
cast
a
large
vote
in
new
york
the
pivotal
state
without
whose
support
in
the
electoral
college
the
carrying
of
the
other
northern
states
went
for
nought
the
mexican
war
followed
and
in
david
wilmot
of
pennsylvania
moved
an
amendment
to
a
bill
appropriating
for
final
negotiations
providing
that
in
all
territories
acquired
from
mexico
slavery
should
be
prohibited
the
wilmot
proviso
was
lost
but
arose
during
the
next
four
years
again
and
again
in
different
forms
but
always
as
the
standard
of
the
antislavery
northerners
when
the
antislavery
agitation
had
reached
an
alarming
extent
and
threatened
to
drive
the
south
into
secession
from
the
union
clay
appeared
once
again
in
his
great
role
as
a
pacificator
to
preserve
the
union
was
the
dearest
object
of
his
public
life
he
would
by
a
timely
concession
avert
the
catastrophe
which
the
southern
leaders
threatened
and
he
probably
warded
off
the
inevitable
combat
when
in
he
made
his
great
speech
in
favor
of
sacrificing
the
wilmot
proviso
and
enacting
a
more
stringent
law
in
embittered
by
having
been
set
aside
as
the
nominee
of
the
whig
party
for
the
presidency
in
favor
of
general
taylor
one
of
the
successful
military
chieftains
in
the
mexican
war
who
as
a
southern
man
with
no
political
principles
or
enemies
was
thought
to
be
more
available
clay
had
retired
from
the
senate
and
for
a
year
had
remained
at
ashland
nominally
and
avowedly
out
of
politics
but
intensely
interested
and
writing
letters
about
the
new
slavery
complications
in
december
he
was
returned
to
the
senate
and
inevitably
became
again
one
of
the
foremost
in
all
the
debates
when
the
conflict
had
grown
hot
and
fierce
in
january
clay
introduced
a
bill
for
harmonizing
all
interests
as
to
the
disputed
question
of
slavery
in
the
new
territory
he
would
pacify
the
north
by
admitting
california
as
a
free
state
and
abolishing
slavery
and
the
in
the
district
of
columbia
while
the
south
was
to
be
placated
by
leaving
utah
and
new
mexico
unrestricted
as
to
slavery
and
by
a
more
efficient
law
for
the
pursuit
and
capture
of
fugitive
slaves
his
speech
occupied
two
days
delivered
in
great
physical
exhaustion
and
was
an
appeal
to
the
north
for
concession
and
to
the
south
for
peace
like
webster
who
followed
with
his
renowned
speech
and
who
alienated
massachusetts
because
he
did
not
go
far
enough
for
freedom
clay
showed
that
there
could
be
no
peaceable
secession
that
secession
meant
war
and
that
it
would
be
war
to
propagate
a
wrong
in
which
the
sympathy
of
all
mankind
would
be
against
us
calhoun
followed
defending
the
interests
of
slavery
which
he
called
the
rights
of
the
south
though
too
weak
to
deliver
his
speech
which
was
read
for
him
he
clearly
saw
the
issue
that
slavery
was
doomed
if
the
union
were
preserved
and
therefore
welcomed
war
before
the
north
should
be
prepared
for
it
it
was
the
south
carolinian
last
great
effort
in
the
senate
for
the
hand
of
death
was
upon
him
he
realized
that
if
the
south
did
not
resist
and
put
down
agitation
on
the
slavery
question
the
cause
would
be
lost
it
was
already
virtually
lost
since
the
conflict
between
freedom
and
slavery
was
manifestly
irrepressible
and
would
come
in
spite
of
concessions
which
only
put
off
the
evil
day
on
the
of
march
seward
of
new
york
now
becoming
prominent
in
the
senate
spoke
deprecating
all
compromise
on
a
matter
of
principle
and
declaring
that
there
was
a
higher
law
than
the
constitution
itself
he
therefore
would
at
least
prevent
the
extension
of
slavery
by
any
means
in
the
power
of
congress
on
the
ground
of
moral
right
not
of
political
expediency
undismayed
by
all
the
threats
of
secession
two
weeks
afterward
chase
of
ohio
took
the
same
ground
as
seward
from
that
time
seward
and
chase
supplanted
webster
and
clay
in
the
confidence
of
the
north
on
all
antislavery
questions
after
seven
months
of
acrimonious
debate
in
both
houses
of
congress
and
during
a
session
of
extraordinary
length
the
compromise
measures
of
clay
were
substantially
passed
a
truce
rather
than
a
peace
which
put
off
the
dreadful
issue
for
eleven
years
longer
it
was
the
best
thing
to
do
for
the
south
was
in
deadly
earnest
exceedingly
exasperated
and
blinded
a
war
in
would
have
had
uncertain
issues
with
such
a
man
as
fillmore
in
the
presidential
chair
to
which
he
had
succeeded
on
the
death
of
taylor
he
was
a
most
respectable
man
and
of
fair
abilities
but
not
of
sufficient
force
and
character
to
guide
the
nation
it
was
better
to
submit
for
a
while
to
the
fugitive
slave
law
than
drive
the
south
out
of
the
union
with
the
logical
consequences
of
the
separation
but
the
abolitionists
had
no
idea
of
submitting
to
a
law
which
was
inhuman
even
to
pacify
the
south
and
the
law
was
resisted
in
boston
which
again
kindled
the
smothered
flames
to
the
great
disappointment
and
alarm
of
clay
for
he
thought
that
his
compromise
bill
had
settled
the
existing
difficulties
in
the
meantime
the
health
of
the
great
pacificator
began
to
decline
he
was
forced
by
a
threatening
and
distressing
cough
to
seek
the
air
of
cuba
which
did
him
no
good
he
was
obliged
to
decline
an
invitation
of
the
citizens
of
new
york
to
address
them
on
the
affairs
of
the
nation
but
wrote
a
long
letter
instead
addressed
more
to
the
south
than
to
the
north
for
he
more
than
any
other
man
saw
the
impending
dangers
although
there
was
a
large
majority
at
the
south
in
favor
of
union
yet
the
minority
had
become
furious
and
comprised
the
ablest
leaders
concerning
whose
intention
such
men
as
seward
and
chase
and
john
hale
were
sceptical
in
the
ferment
of
excited
passions
it
is
not
safe
to
calculate
on
men
acting
according
to
reason
it
is
wiser
to
predict
that
they
will
act
against
reason
here
clay
was
wiser
in
his
anxiety
than
the
northern
statesmen
generally
who
thought
there
would
be
peace
because
it
was
reasonable
clay
did
not
live
to
see
all
compromises
thrown
to
the
winds
he
died
june
in
the
year
of
his
age
at
the
national
hotel
in
washington
imposing
funeral
ceremonies
took
place
amid
general
lamentation
and
the
whole
country
responded
with
glowing
eulogies
i
have
omitted
allusion
to
other
speeches
which
the
great
statesman
made
in
his
long
public
career
and
have
presented
only
the
salient
points
of
his
life
in
which
his
parliamentary
eloquence
blazed
with
the
greatest
heat
for
he
was
the
greatest
orator
in
general
estimation
that
this
country
has
produced
although
inferior
to
webster
in
massive
power
in
purity
of
style
in
weight
of
argument
and
breadth
of
knowledge
to
my
mind
his
speeches
are
diffuse
and
exaggerated
and
wanting
in
simplicity
but
what
reads
the
best
is
not
always
the
most
effective
in
debate
certainly
no
american
orator
approached
him
in
electrical
power
no
one
had
more
devoted
friends
no
one
was
more
generally
beloved
no
one
had
greater
experience
or
rendered
more
valuable
public
services
and
yet
he
failed
to
reach
the
presidency
to
which
for
thirty
years
he
had
aspired
and
which
at
times
seemed
within
his
grasp
he
had
made
powerful
enemies
especially
in
jackson
and
his
partisans
and
politicians
dreaded
his
ascendency
and
feared
that
as
president
he
would
be
dictatorial
though
not
perhaps
arbitrary
like
jackson
he
would
have
been
a
happier
man
if
he
had
not
so
eagerly
coveted
a
prize
which
it
seems
is
unattainable
by
mere
force
of
intellect
and
is
often
conferred
apparently
by
accidental
circumstances
it
is
too
high
an
office
to
be
sought
either
by
genius
or
services
except
in
the
military
line
but
even
general
scott
the
real
hero
of
the
mexican
war
failed
in
his
ambitious
aspirations
as
well
as
webster
clay
calhoun
benton
seward
chase
and
douglas
while
less
prominent
men
were
selected
and
probably
ever
will
be
this
may
be
looked
at
as
a
rebuke
to
political
ambition
which
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
the
fame
conferred
by
genius
rather
than
that
of
place
which
never
yet
made
a
man
really
great
the
presidency
would
have
added
nothing
to
the
glory
which
clay
won
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
it
certainly
added
nothing
to
the
fame
of
grant
which
was
won
on
the
battlefield
and
it
detracted
from
that
of
jackson
and
yet
clay
felt
keenly
the
disappointment
that
with
all
his
talents
and
services
weaker
men
were
preferred
to
him
aside
from
the
weakness
of
clay
in
attempting
to
grasp
a
phantom
his
character
stands
out
in
an
interesting
light
on
the
whole
he
had
his
faults
and
failings
which
did
not
interfere
with
his
ambition
and
great
and
noble
traits
which
more
than
balanced
them
the
most
marked
of
which
was
the
patriotism
whose
fire
never
went
out
if
any
man
ever
loved
his
country
and
devoted
all
the
energies
of
his
mind
and
soul
to
promote
its
welfare
and
secure
its
lasting
union
that
man
was
the
illustrious
senator
from
kentucky
whose
eloquent
pleadings
were
household
words
for
nearly
half
a
century
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
with
him
there
was
no
east
no
west
no
north
and
no
south
to
be
especially
favored
or
served
but
the
whole
country
one
and
indivisible
for
ages
to
come
and
no
other
man
in
high
position
had
a
more
glowing
conviction
of
its
power
and
glory
than
he
whether
says
his
best
biographer
he
thundered
against
british
tyranny
on
the
seas
or
urged
the
recognition
of
the
south
american
sister
republics
or
attacked
the
conduct
of
the
military
chieftain
in
the
florida
war
or
advocated
protection
and
internal
improvements
or
assailed
the
power
and
spoils
politics
in
the
person
of
andrew
jackson
or
entreated
for
compromise
and
conciliation
regarding
the
tariff
or
slavery
there
was
always
ringing
through
his
words
a
fervid
plea
for
his
country
a
zealous
appeal
in
behalf
of
the
honor
and
the
future
greatness
and
glory
of
the
republic
or
an
anxious
warning
lest
the
union
be
put
in
jeopardy
one
thing
is
certain
that
no
man
in
the
country
exercised
so
great
an
influence
for
a
generation
in
shaping
the
policy
of
national
legislation
as
henry
clay
a
policy
which
on
the
whole
has
proved
enlightened
benignant
and
useful
and
hence
his
name
and
memory
will
not
only
be
honorably
mentioned
by
historians
but
will
be
fondly
cherished
so
long
as
american
institutions
shall
endure
he
is
one
of
the
greater
lights
in
the
galaxy
of
american
stars
as
he
was
the
advocate
of
principles
which
have
proved
conducive
to
national
prosperity
in
the
first
century
of
the
nation
history
it
is
a
great
thing
to
give
shape
to
the
beneficent
institutions
of
a
country
and
especially
to
be
a
source
of
patriotic
inspiration
to
its
people
it
is
greater
glory
than
to
be
enrolled
in
the
list
of
presidents
especially
if
they
are
mentioned
only
as
the
fortunate
occupants
of
a
great
office
to
which
they
were
blindly
elected
of
the
long
succession
of
the
occupants
of
the
papal
chair
the
most
august
of
worldly
dignities
not
one
in

left
a
mark
or
is
of
any
historical
importance
while
hundreds
of
churchmen
and

in
comparatively
humble
positions
have
left
an
immortal
fame
the
glory
of
clay
is
not
dimmed
because
he
failed
in

ambition
it
is
enough
to
be
embalmed
in
the
hearts
of

shine

i
were
required
to
single
out
the
most
prominent
political
genius
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
after
the
death
of
hamilton
i
should
say
it
was
daniel
webster
he
reigned
for
thirty
years
as
a
political
dictator
to
his
party
and
at
the
same
time
was
the
acknowledged
head
of
the
american
bar
he
occupied
two
spheres
in
each
of
which
he
gained
but
for
envy
and
the
enemies
he
made
he
probably
would
have
reached
the
highest
honor
that
the
nation
had
to
bestow
his
influence
was
vast
until
those
discussions
arose
which
provoked
one
of
the
most
gigantic
wars
of
modern
times
for
a
generation
he
was
the
object
of
universal
admiration
for
his
eloquence
and
power
in
political
wisdom
and
experience
he
had
no
contemporaneous
superior
there
was
no
public
man
from
to
who
had
so
great
a
prestige
and
whose
name
and
labors
are
so
well
remembered
his
speeches
and
forensic
arguments
are
more
often
quoted
than
those
of
any
other
statesman
and
lawyer
the
country
has
produced
his
works
are
in
every
library
and
are
still
read
his
fame
has
not
waned
in
spite
of
the
stirring
events
which
have
taken
place
since
his
death
great
generals
have
arisen
and
passed
out
of
mind
but
the
name
and
memory
of
webster
are
still
fresh
amid
the
tumults
and
parties
of
the
war
he
foresaw
and
dreaded
his
glory
may
have
passed
through
an
eclipse
but
his
name
is
one
of
the
proudest
connected
with
our
history
living
men
occupying
great
official
positions
are
of
course
more
talked
about
and
thought
of
than
he
but
of
those
illustrious
characters
who
figured
in
public
affairs
a
generation
ago
no
one
has
so
great
a
posthumous
fame
and
influence
as
the
distinguished
senator
from
massachusetts
no
man
since
the
days
of
jefferson
is
seated
on
a
loftier
pedestal
and
no
one
is
likely
to
live
longer
if
not
in
the
nation
heart
yet
in
its
admiration
for
intellectual
superiority
and
respect
for
political
services
while
he
reigned
as
a
political
oracle
for
more
than
thirty
years
almost
an
idol
in
the
eyes
of
his
constituents
it
was
his
misfortune
to
be
dethroned
and
reviled
in
the
last
ten
years
of
his
life
by
the
very
people
who
had
exalted
and
honored
him
and
at
last
to
die
from
the
loss
of
his
popularity
and
the
failure
of
his
ambitious
expectations
his
life
is
sad
as
well
as
proud
like
that
of
so
many
other
great
men
who
at
one
time
led
and
at
another
time
opposed
popular
sentiments
their
names
stand
out
on
every
page
of
history
examples
of
the
mutability
of
fortune
alike
joyous
and
saddened
men
reaping
both
glory
and
shame
and
sometimes
glory
for
what
is
evil
and
shame
for
what
is
good
when
daniel
webster
was
born
in
salisbury
new
hampshire
near
the
close
of
our
revolutionary
struggle
were
very
few
prominent
and
wealthy
families
in
new
england
very
few
men
more
respectable
than
the
village
lawyers
doctors
and
merchants
or
even
thrifty
and
intelligent
farmers
very
few
great
fortunes
had
been
acquired
and
these
chiefly
by
the
merchants
of
boston
salem
portsmouth
and
other
seaports
whose
ships
had
penetrated
to
all
parts
of
the
world
webster
sprang
from
the
agricultural
class
larger
then
in
proportion
to
the
other
classes
than
now
at
the
east
at
a
time
when
manufactures
were
in
their
infancy
and
needed
protection
when
travel
was
limited
when
it
was
a
rare
thing
for
a
man
to
visit
europe
when
the
people
were
obliged
to
practise
the
most
rigid
economy
when
everybody
went
to
church
when
religious
scepticism
sent
those
who
avowed
it
to
coventry
when
ministers
were
the
leading
power
when
the
press
was
feeble
and
elections
were
not
controlled
by
foreign
immigrants
when
men
drank
rum
instead
of
whiskey
and
lager
beer
had
never
been
heard
of
nor
the
great
inventions
and
scientific
wonders
which
make
our
age
an
era
had
anywhere
appeared
the
age
of
progress
had
scarcely
then
set
in
and
everybody
was
obliged
to
work
in
some
way
to
get
an
honest
living
for
the
revolutionary
war
had
left
the
country
poor
and
had
shut
up
many
channels
of
industry
the
farmers
at
that
time
were
the
most
numerous
and
powerful
class
sharp
but
honest
and
intelligent
who
honored
learning
and
enjoyed
discussions
on
metaphysical
divinity
their
sons
did
not
then
leave
the
paternal
acres
to
become
clerks
in
distant
cities
nor
did
their
daughters
spend
their
time
in
reading
french
novels
or
sneering
at
rustic
duties
and
labors
this
age
of
progress
had
not
arisen
when
everybody
looks
forward
to
a
millennium
of
idleness
and
luxury
or
to
a
fortune
acquired
by
speculation
and
gambling
rather
than
by
the
sweat
of
the
brow
an
age
in
many
important
respects
justly
extolled
especially
for
scientific
discoveries
and
mechanical
inventions
yet
not
remarkable
for
religious
earnestness
or
moral
elevation
the
life
of
daniel
webster
is
familiar
to
all
intelligent
people
his
early
days
were
spent
amid
the
toils
and
blessedness
of
a
new
england
favored
by
the
teachings
of
intelligent
parents
who
had
the
means
to
send
him
to
phillips
academy
in
exeter
then
recently
founded
where
he
fitted
for
college
and
shortly
after
entered
dartmouth
at
the
age
of
fifteen
in
connection
with
webster
i
do
not
read
of
any
remarkable
precocity
at
school
or
college
such
as
marked
cicero
macaulay
and
gladstone
but
it
seems
that
he
won
the
esteem
of
both
teachers
and
students
and
was
regarded
as
a
very
promising
youth
after
his
graduation
he
taught
an
academy
at
fryeburg
for
a
time
and
then
began
the
study
of
the
law
first
at
salisbury
and
subsequently
in
boston
in
the
office
of
the
celebrated
governor
gore
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar
in
and
established
himself
in
boscawen
but
soon
afterwards
removed
to
portsmouth
where
he
entered
on
a
large
practice
encountering
such
able
lawyers
as
jeremiah
mason
and
jeremiah
smith
who
both
became
his
friends
and
admirers
for
legal
powers
were
soon
the
talk
of
the
state
at
the
early
age
of
he
entered
congress
and
took
the
whole
house
by
surprise
with
his
remarkable
speeches
during
the
war
with
great
britain
on
such
topics
as
the
enlargement
of
the
navy
the
repeal
of
the
embargo
and
the
complicated
financial
questions
of
the
day
in
he
retired
awhile
from
public
life
and
removed
to
boston
where
he
enjoyed
a
lucrative
practice
in
he
congress
so
popular
was
he
at
this
time
that
on
his
to
congress
in
he
received
four
thousand
nine
hundred
and
ninety
votes
out
of
five
thousand
votes
cast
in
he
entered
the
senate
where
he
was
to
reign
as
one
of
its
greatest
chiefs
the
idol
of
his
party
in
new
england
practising
his
profession
at
the
same
time
a
leader
of
the
american
bar
and
an
oracle
in
politics
on
all
constitutional
questions
with
this
rapid
sketch
i
proceed
to
enumerate
the
services
of
daniel
webster
to
his
country
since
on
these
enduring
fame
and
gratitude
are
based
and
first
i
allude
to
his
career
as
a
lawyer
not
a
narrow
technical
lawyer
seeking
to
gain
his
case
any
way
he
can
with
an
eye
on
pecuniary
rewards
alone
but
a
lawyer
devoting
himself
to
the
study
of
great
constitutional
questions
and
fundamental
principles
in
his
legal
career
when
for
nearly
forty
years
he
discussed
almost
every
issue
that
can
arise
between
individuals
and
communities
some
cases
have
become
historical
because
of
the
importance
of
the
principles
and
interests
involved
in
the
gibbons
and
ogden
case
he
assumed
the
broad
ground
that
the
grant
of
power
to
regulate
commerce
was
exclusively
the
right
of
the
general
government
william
wirt
his
distinguished
antagonist
then
at
the
height
of
his
fame
relied
on
the
coasting
license
given
by
states
but
the
lucid
and
luminous
arguments
of
the
young
lawyer
astonished
the
court
and
made
old
judge
marshall
lay
down
his
pen
drop
back
in
his
chair
turn
up
his
and
stare
at
the
speaker
in
amazement
at
his
powers
the
first
great
case
which
gave
webster
a
national
reputation
was
that
pertaining
to
dartmouth
college
his
which
he
loved
as
newton
loved
cambridge
the
college
was
in
the
hands
of
politicians
and
webster
recovered
the
college
from
their
hands
and
restored
it
to
the
trustees
laying
down
such
broad
principles
that
every
literary
and
benevolent
institution
in
this
land
will
be
grateful
to
him
forever
this
case
which
was
argued
with
consummate
ability
and
with
words
as
eloquent
as
they
were
logical
and
lucid
melting
a
cold
court
into
tears
placed
webster
in
the
front
rank
of
lawyers
which
he
kept
until
he
died
in
the
ogden
and
saunders
case
he
settled
the
constitutionality
of
state
bankrupt
laws
in
that
of
the
united
states
bank
he
maintained
the
right
of
a
citizen
of
one
state
to
perform
any
legal
act
in
another
in
that
which
related
to
the
efficacy
of
stephen
girard
will
he
demonstrated
the
vital
importance
of
christianity
to
the
success
of
free
institutions
so
that
this
very
college
which
excluded
clergymen
from
being
teachers
in
it
or
even
visiting
it
has
since
been
presided
over
by
laymen
of
high
religious
character
like
judge
jones
and
doctor
allen
in
the
rhode
island
case
he
proved
the
right
of
a
state
to
modify
its
own
institutions
of
government
in
the
knapp
murder
case
he
brought
out
the
power
of
conscience
the
voice
of
god
to
the
soul
with
such
terrible
forensic
eloquence
that
he
was
the
admiration
of
all
christian
people
no
better
sermon
was
ever
preached
than
this
appeal
to
the
conscience
of
men
in
these
and
other
cases
he
settled
very
difficult
and
important
questions
so
that
the
courts
of
law
will
long
be
ruled
by
his
wisdom
he
enriched
the
science
of
jurisprudence
itself
by
bringing
out
the
fundamental
laws
of
justice
and
equity
on
which
the
whole
science
rests
he
was
not
as
learned
as
he
was
logical
and
comprehensive
his
greatness
as
a
lawyer
consisted
in
seeing
and
seizing
some
vital
point
not
obvious
or
whose
importance
was
not
perceived
by
his
opponent
and
then
bringing
to
bear
on
this
point
the
whole
power
of
his
intellect
his
knowledge
was
marvellous
on
those
points
essential
to
his
argument
but
he
was
not
probably
learned
like
kent
in
questions
outside
his
cases
i
mean
the
details
and
technicalities
of
law
he
did
however
know
the
fundamental
principles
on
which
his
great
cases
turned
and
these
he
enforced
with
much
eloquence
and
power
so
that
his
ablest
opponents
quailed
before
him
perhaps
his
commanding
presence
and
powerful
tones
and
wonderful
eye
had
something
to
do
with
his
success
at
the
bar
as
well
as
in
the
senate
a
brow
a
voice
and
an
eye
that
meant
war
when
he
was
fairly
aroused
although
he
appealed
generally
to
reason
without
tricks
of
rhetoric
if
he
sometimes
intimidated
he
rarely
resorted
to
exaggerations
but
confined
himself
strictly
to
the
facts
so
that
he
seemed
the
fairest
of
men
this
moderation
had
great
weight
with
an
intelligent
jury
and
with
learned
judges
he
always
paid
great
deference
to
the
court
and
was
generally
courteous
to
his
opponents
of
all
his
antagonists
at
the
bar
perhaps
it
was
jeremiah
mason
and
rufus
choate
whom
he
most
dreaded
yet
both
of
these
great
men
were
his
warm
friends
warfare
at
the
bar
does
not
mean
personal
animosity
it
is
generally
mutual
admiration
except
in
the
antagonism
of
such
rivals
as
hamilton
and
burr
webster
admiration
for
wirt
pinkney
curtis
and
mason
was
free
from
all
envy
in
fact
webster
was
too
great
a
man
for
envy
and
great
lawyers
were
those
whom
he
loved
best
whom
he
felt
to
be
his
brethren
not
secret
enemies
his
admiration
for
jeremiah
mason
was
only
equalled
by
that
for
judge
marshall
who
was
not
a
rival
webster
praised
marshall
as
he
might
have
erskine
or
lyndhurst
webster
again
attained
to
great
eminence
in
another
sphere
in
which
lawyers
have
not
always
succeeded
that
of
popular
oratory
in
the
shape
of
speeches
and
lectures
and
orations
to
the
people
directly
in
this
sphere
i
doubt
if
he
ever
had
an
equal
in
this
country
although
edward
everett
rufus
choate
wendell
phillips
and
others
were
distinguished
for
their
popular
eloquence
and
in
some
respects
were
the
equals
of
webster
but
he
was
a
great
teacher
of
the
people
directly
a
sort
of
lecturer
on
the
principles
of
government
of
finance
of
education
of
agriculture
of
commerce
he
was
superbly
eloquent
in
his
eulogies
of
great
men
like
adams
and
jefferson
his
bunker
hill
and
plymouth
addresses
are
immortal
he
lectured
occasionally
before
lyceums
and
literary
institutions
he
spoke
to
farmers
in
their
agricultural
meetings
and
to
merchants
in
marts
of
commerce
he
did
not
go
into
political
campaigns
to
any
great
extent
as
is
now
the
custom
with
political
leaders
on
the
eve
of
important
elections
he
did
not
seek
to
show
the
people
how
they
should
vote
so
much
as
to
teach
them
elemental
principles
he
was
the
oracle
the
sage
the
teacher
not
the
politician
in
the
popular
assemblies
whether
for
the
discussion
of
political
truths
or
those
which
bear
on
literature
education
history
finance
or
industrial
pursuits
webster
was
what
audiences
were
ever
more
enthusiastic
than
those
that
gathered
to
hear
his
wisdom
and
eloquence
in
public
halls
or
in
the
open
air
it
is
true
that
in
his
later
years
he
lost
much
of
his
wonderful
personal
magnetism
and
did
not
rise
to
public
expectation
except
on
great
occasions
but
in
middle
life
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
congressional
career
he
had
no
peer
as
a
popular
orator
edward
everett
on
some
occasions
was
his
equal
so
far
as
manner
and
words
were
concerned
but
on
the
whole
even
in
his
grandest
efforts
everett
was
cold
compared
with
webster
in
his
palmy
days
he
never
touched
the
heart
and
reason
as
did
webster
although
it
must
be
conceded
that
everett
was
a
great
rhetorician
and
was
master
of
many
of
the
graces
of
oratory
the
speeches
and
orations
of
webster
were
not
only
weighty
in
matter
but
were
wonderful
for
their
style
so
clear
so
simple
so
direct
that
everybody
could
understand
him
he
rarely
attempted
to
express
more
than
one
thought
in
a
single
sentence
so
that
his
sentences
never
wearied
an
audience
being
always
logical
and
precise
not
involved
and
long
and
complicated
like
the
periods
of
chalmers
and
choate
and
so
many
of
the
english
orators
it
was
only
in
his
grand
perorations
that
he
was
ciceronian
he
despised
purely
extemporary
efforts
he
did
not
believe
in
them
he
admits
somewhere
that
he
never
could
make
a
good
speech
without
careful
preparation
the
principles
embodied
in
his
famous
reply
to
colonel
hayne
of
south
carolina
in
the
debate
in
the
senate
on
the
right
of
nullification
had
lain
brooding
in
his
mind
for
eighteen
months
to
a
young
minister
he
said
there
is
no
such
thing
as
extemporaneous
acquisition
webster
speeches
are
likely
to
live
for
their
style
alone
outside
their
truths
like
those
of
cicero
and
demosthenes
like
the
histories
of
voltaire
and
macaulay
like
the
essays
of
pascal
and
rousseau
and
they
will
live
not
only
for
both
style
and
matter
but
for
the
exalted
patriotism
which
burns
in
them
from
first
to
last
for
those
sentiments
which
consecrate
cherished
institutions
how
nobly
he
recognizes
christianity
as
the
bulwark
of
national
prosperity
how
delightfully
he
presents
the
endearments
of
home
the
certitudes
of
friendship
the
peace
of
agricultural
life
the
repose
of
all
industrial
pursuits
however
humble
and
obscure
it
was
this
fervid
patriotism
this
public
recognition
of
what
is
purest
in
human
life
and
exalted
in
aspirations
and
profound
in
experience
teaching
the
value
of
our
privileges
and
the
glory
of
our
institutions
which
gave
such
effect
to
his
eloquence
and
endeared
him
to
the
hearts
of
the
people
until
he
opposed
their
passions
if
we
read
any
of
these
speeches
extending
over
thirty
years
we
shall
find
everywhere
the
same
consistent
spirit
of
liberty
of
union
of
conciliation
the
same
moral
wisdom
the
same
insight
into
great
truths
the
same
recognition
of
what
is
sacred
the
same
repose
on
what
is
permanent
the
same
faith
in
the
expanding
glories
of
this
great
nation
which
he
loved
with
all
his
heart
in
all
his
speeches
one
can
not
find
a
sentence
which
insults
the
consecrated
sentiments
of
religion
or
patriotism
he
never
casts
a
fling
at
christianity
he
never
utters
a
sarcasm
in
reference
to
revealed
truths
he
never
flippantly
aspires
to
be
wiser
than
moses
or
paul
in
reference
to
theological
dogmas
ah
my
friends
said
he
in
let
us
remember
that
it
is
only
religion
and
morals
and
knowledge
that
can
make
men
respectable
and
happy
under
any
form
of
government
that
no
government
is
respectable
which
is
not
just
that
without
unspotted
purity
of
public
faith
without
sacred
public
principle
fidelity
and
honor
no
mere
form
of
government
no
machinery
of
laws
can
give
dignity
to
political
society
thus
did
he
discourse
in
those
proud
days
when
he
was
accepted
as
a
national
idol
and
a
national
benefactor
those
days
of
triumph
and
of
victory
when
the
people
gathered
around
him
as
they
gather
around
a
successful
general
ah
how
they
thronged
to
the
spot
where
he
was
expected
to
speak
as
the
scotch
people
thronged
to
edinboro
and
glasgow
to
hear
gladstone
and
when
they
saw
his
chariot
but
appear
did
they
not
make
an
universal
shout
that
tiber
trembled
underneath
her
banks
to
hear
the
replication
of
their
sounds
made
in
her
concave
shores
but
it
is
time
that
i
allude
to
those
great
services
which
webster
rendered
to
his
country
when
he
was
a
member
of
congress
services
that
can
never
be
forgotten
and
which
made
him
a
national
benefactor
there
were
three
classes
of
subjects
on
which
his
genius
shone
questions
of
finance
the
development
of
american
industries
and
the
defence
of
the
constitution
as
early
as
webster
acquired
a
national
reputation
by
his
speech
on
the
proposition
to
establish
a
national
bank
which
he
opposed
since
it
was
to
be
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
redeeming
its
notes
in
specie
this
was
at
the
close
of
the
war
with
great
britain
when
the
country
was
poor
business
prostrated
and
the
finances
disordered
to
relieve
this
pressure
many
wanted
an
inflated
paper
currency
which
should
stimulate
trade
but
all
this
webster
opposed
as
certain
to
add
to
the
evils
it
was
designed
to
cure
he
would
have
a
bank
indeed
but
he
insisted
it
should
be
established
on
sound
financial
principles
with
notes
redeemable
in
gold
and
silver
and
he
brought
a
great
array
of
facts
to
show
the
certain
and
utter
failure
of
a
system
of
banking
operations
which
disregarded
the
fundamental
financial
laws
he
maintained
that
an
inflated
currency
produced
only
temporary
and
illusive
benefits
nor
did
he
believe
in
hopes
which
were
not
sustained
by
experience
banks
said
he
are
not
revenue
they
may
afford
facilities
for
its
collection
and
distribution
but
they
can
not
be
sources
of
national
income
which
must
flow
from
deeper
fountains
whatever
are
not
convertible
into
gold
and
silver
at
the
will
of
the
holder
become
of
less
value
than
gold
and
silver
no
solidity
of
funds
no
confidence
in
banking
operations
has
ever
enabled
them
to
keep
up
their
paper
to
the
value
of
gold
and
silver
any
longer
than
they
paid
gold
and
silver
on
demand
similar
sentiments
he
advanced
in
in
his
speech
on
the
legal
currency
and
also
in
when
he
said
that
a
disordered
currency
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
political
evils
fatal
to
industry
frugality
and
economy
it
fosters
the
spirit
of
speculation
and
extravagance
it
is
the
most
effectual
of
inventions
to
fertilize
the
rich
man
field
by
the
sweat
of
the
poor
man
brow
in
these
days
when
principles
of
finance
are
better
understood
these
remarks
may
seem
like
platitudes
but
they
were
not
so
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
for
then
they
had
the
force
of
new
truth
although
even
then
they
were
the
result
of
political
wisdom
based
on
knowledge
and
experience
and
his
views
were
adopted
for
he
appealed
to
reason
webster
financial
speeches
are
very
calm
like
the
papers
of
hamilton
and
jay
in
the
federalist
but
as
interesting
and
persuasive
as
those
of
gladstone
the
greatest
of
modern
times
they
are
plain
simple
direct
without
much
attempt
at
rhetoric
he
spoke
like
a
great
lawyer
to
a
bench
of
judges
the
solidity
and
soundness
of
his
views
made
him
greatly
respected
and
were
remarkable
in
a
young
man
of
the
subsequent
financial
history
of
the
country
shows
that
he
was
prophetic
all
his
predictions
have
come
to
pass
what
is
more
marked
in
our
history
than
the
extravagance
and
speculation
attending
the
expansion
of
paper
money
irredeemable
in
gold
and
silver
what
misery
and
disappointment
have
resulted
from
inflated
values
it
was
doubtless
necessary
to
do
without
gold
and
silver
in
our
struggle
with
the
south
but
it
was
nevertheless
a
misfortune
seen
in
the
gambling
operations
and
the
wild
fever
of
speculation
which
attended
the
immense
issue
of
paper
money
after
the
war
the
bubble
was
sure
to
burst
sooner
or
later
like
john
law
mississippi
scheme
in
the
time
of
louis
xv
how
many
thousands
thought
themselves
rich
in
new
york
and
chicago
in
fact
everywhere
when
they
were
really
poor
as
any
man
is
poor
when
his
house
or
farm
is
not
worth
the
mortgage
as
soon
as
we
returned
to
gold
and
silver
or
it
was
known
we
should
return
to
them
then
all
values
shrunk
and
even
many
a
successful
merchant
found
he
was
really
no
richer
than
he
was
before
the
war
it
had
been
easy
to
secure
heavy
mortgages
on
inflated
values
and
also
to
get
a
great
interest
on
investments
but
when
these
mortgages
and
investments
shrank
to
what
they
were
really
worth
the
holders
of
them
became
embarrassed
and
impoverished
the
fit
of
commercial
intoxication
was
succeeded
by
depression
and
unhappiness
and
the
moral
evils
of
inflated
values
were
greater
than
the
financial
since
of
all
demoralizing
things
the
spirit
of
speculation
and
gambling
brings
at
last
the
most
dismal
train
of
disappointments
and
miseries
inflation
and
uncertainty
in
values
whether
in
stocks
or
real
estate
alternating
with
the
return
of
prosperity
seem
to
have
marked
the
commercial
and
financial
history
of
this
country
during
the
last
fifty
years
more
than
that
of
any
other
nation
under
the
sun
and
given
rise
to
the
spirit
of
extravagant
speculations
both
disgraceful
and
ruinous
equally
remarkable
were
webster
speeches
on
tariffs
and
protective
industries
he
here
seemed
to
borrow
from
alexander
hamilton
who
is
the
father
of
our
protective
system
here
he
with
henry
clay
and
the
result
of
his
eloquence
and
wisdom
on
those
great
principles
of
political
economy
was
the
adherence
to
a
policy
against
great
opposition
which
built
up
new
england
and
did
not
impoverish
the
west
where
would
the
towns
of
lowell
manchester
and
lawrence
have
been
without
the
aid
extended
to
manufacturing
interests
they
made
the
nation
comparatively
independent
of
other
nations
they
enriched
the
country
even
as
manufactures
enriched
great
britain
and
france
what
would
england
be
if
it
were
only
an
agricultural
country
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
establish
manufactures
of
textile
fabrics
without
protection
without
aid
from
governments
this
branch
of
american
industry
would
have
had
no
chance
to
contend
with
the
cheap
labor
of
european
artisans
i
do
not
believe
in
cheap
labor
i
do
not
believe
in
reducing
intelligent
people
to
the
condition
of
animals
i
would
give
them
the
chance
to
rise
and
they
can
not
rise
if
they
are
doomed
to
labor
for
a
mere
pittance
the
more
wages
men
can
get
for
honest
labor
the
better
is
the
condition
of
the
whole
country
withdraw
protection
from
infant
industries
and
either
they
perish
or
those
who
work
in
them
sink
to
the
condition
of
the
laboring
classes
of
europe
nor
do
i
believe
it
is
a
good
thing
for
a
nation
to
have
all
its
eggs
in
one
basket
i
would
not
make
this
country
exclusively
agricultural
because
we
have
boundless
fields
and
can
raise
corn
cheap
any
more
than
i
would
recommend
a
minnesota
farmer
to
raise
nothing
but
wheat
insects
and
mildews
and
unexpected
heats
may
blast
a
whole
harvest
and
the
farmer
has
nothing
to
fall
back
upon
he
may
make
more
money
for
a
time
by
raising
wheat
exclusively
but
he
impoverishes
his
farm
he
should
raise
cattle
and
sheep
and
grass
and
vegetables
as
well
as
wheat
or
corn
then
he
is
more
independent
and
more
intelligent
even
as
a
nation
is
by
various
industries
which
call
out
all
kinds
of
talent
i
know
that
this
is
a
controverted
point
everything
controverted
in
political
economy
there
is
scarcely
a
question
which
is
settled
in
its
whole
range
of
subjects
and
i
know
that
many
intellectual
and
enlightened
men
are
in
favor
of
what
they
call
especially
professors
in
colleges
but
there
is
no
such
thing
as
strictly
in
any
nation
or
in
the
history
of
nations
no
nation
legislates
for
universal
humanity
on
philanthropic
principles
it
legislates
for
itself
there
is
no
country
where
there
are
not
high
duties
on
some
things
not
even
england
no
nation
can
be
governed
on
abstract
principles
and
in
disregard
of
its
necessities
when
it
was
for
the
interest
of
england
to
remove
duties
on
corn
in
order
that
manufactures
might
be
stimulated
they
took
off
duties
on
corn
because
the
in
the
mills
had
to
be
fed
agricultural
interests
gave
way
for
a
time
to
manufacturing
interests
because
the
wealth
of
the
country
was
based
on
them
rather
than
on
lands
and
because
landlords
did
not
anticipate
that
brought
from
this
country
would
interfere
with
the
value
of
their
rents
but
england
with
all
her
proud
and
selfish
boasts
about
may
yet
have
to
take
a
retrograde
course
like
france
and
prussia
or
her
landed
interests
may
be
imperilled
the
english
aristocracy
who
rule
the
country
can
not
afford
to
have
the
value
of
their
lands
reduced
for
those
lands
are
so
heavily
mortgaged
that
such
a
reduction
of
value
would
ruin
them
nor
will
they
like
to
be
forced
to
raise
vegetables
rather
than
wheat
and
turn
themselves
into
instead
of
great
proprietors
the
landlords
of
great
britain
may
yet
demand
protection
for
themselves
and
as
they
control
parliament
they
will
look
out
for
themselves
by
enacting
measures
of
protection
unless
they
are
intimidated
by
the
people
who
demand
cheap
bread
or
unless
they
submit
to
revolution
it
is
eternal
equity
and
wisdom
that
the
weak
should
be
protected
there
may
be
industries
strong
enough
now
to
dispense
with
protection
but
unless
they
are
assisted
when
they
are
feeble
they
will
cease
to
exist
at
all
take
our
shipping
for
instance
with
foreign
ports
it
is
not
merely
crippled
it
is
almost
annihilated
is
it
desirable
to
cut
off
that
great
arm
of
national
strength
shall
we
march
on
to
our
destiny
blind
and
lame
and
halt
what
will
we
do
if
england
and
other
countries
shall
find
it
necessary
to
protect
themselves
from
impoverishment
and
reintroduce
duties
on
high
enough
to
make
the
culture
of
wheat
profitable
where
then
will
our
farmers
find
a
market
for
their
superfluous
corn
except
to
those
engaged
in
industries
which
we
should
crush
by
removing
protection
i
maintain
that
webster
in
defending
our
various
industries
with
so
much
ability
for
the
benefit
of
the
nation
on
the
whole
rendered
very
important
services
even
as
hamilton
and
clay
did
although
the
solid
south
wishing
cheap
labor
and
engaged
exclusively
in
agriculture
was
opposed
to
him
the
independent
south
would
have
established
as
calhoun
advocated
and
as
any
enlightened
statesman
would
advocate
when
any
interest
can
stand
alone
and
defy
competition
as
was
the
case
with
the
manufactures
of
great
britain
fifty
years
ago
the
interests
of
the
south
and
those
of
the
north
under
the
institution
of
slavery
were
not
identical
indeed
they
had
been
in
fierce
opposition
for
more
than
fifty
years
webster
was
in
his
arguments
on
tariffs
and
cognate
questions
the
champion
of
the
north
as
calhoun
was
of
the
south
and
this
opposition
and
antagonism
gave
great
force
to
webster
eloquence
at
this
time
his
sentences
are
short
interrogative
idiomatic
he
is
intensely
in
earnest
he
grapples
with
sophistries
and
scatters
them
to
the
winds
both
reason
and
passion
vivify
him
this
was
the
period
of
webster
greatest
popularity
as
the
defender
of
northern
industries
this
made
him
the
idol
of
the
merchants
and
manufacturers
of
new
england
he
made
them
rich
no
wonder
they
made
him
presents
they
ought
in
gratitude
to
have
paid
his
debts
over
and
over
again
what
if
he
did
in
straitened
circumstances
accept
their
aid
they
owed
to
him
more
than
he
owed
to
them
and
with
all
their
favor
and
bounty
webster
remained
poor
he
was
never
a
rich
man
but
always
an
embarrassed
man
because
he
had
expensive
tastes
like
cicero
at
rome
and
bacon
in
england
this
truly
was
not
to
his
credit
it
was
a
flaw
in
his
character
it
involved
him
in
debt
created
enemies
and
injured
his
reputation
it
may
have
lessened
his
independence
and
it
certainly
impaired
his
dignity
but
there
were
also
patriotic
motives
which
prompted
him
and
which
kept
him
poor
had
he
devoted
his
great
talents
exclusively
to
the
law
he
might
have
been
rich
but
he
gave
his
time
to
his
country
his
greatest
services
to
his
country
however
were
as
the
defender
of
the
constitution
here
he
soared
to
the
highest
rank
of
political
fame
here
he
was
a
statesman
having
in
view
the
interests
of
the
whole
country
he
never
was
what
we
call
a
politician
he
never
was
such
a
miserable
creature
as
that
i
mean
a
mere
politician
whose
calling
is
the
meanest
a
man
can
follow
since
it
seeks
only
spoils
and
is
a
perpetual
deception
incompatible
with
all
dignity
and
independence
whose
only
watchword
is
success
not
such
was
webster
he
was
too
proud
and
too
dignified
for
that
form
of
degradation
and
he
perhaps
sacrificed
his
popularity
to
his
intellectual
dignity
and
the
glorious
consciousness
of
being
a
national
benefactor
as
a
real
statesman
seeks
to
be
and
is
when
he
falls
back
on
the
elemental
principles
of
justice
and
morality
like
a
late
premier
of
england
one
of
the
most
conscientious
statesmen
that
ever
controlled
the
destinies
of
a
nation
webster
like
burke
was
haughty
austere
and
brave
but
such
a
man
is
not
likely
to
remain
the
favorite
of
the
people
who
prefer
an
alcibiades
to
a
cato
except
in
great
crises
when
they
look
to
a
man
who
can
save
them
and
whom
they
can
forget
i
can
not
enumerate
the
magnificent
bursts
of
eloquence
which
electrified
the
whole
country
when
webster
stood
out
as
the
defender
of
the
constitution
when
he
combated
secession
and
defended
the
union
how
noble
and
gigantic
he
was
when
he
answered
the
aspersions
of
the
southern
orators
great
men
as
they
were
and
elaborately
showed
that
the
union
meant
something
more
than
a
league
of
sovereign
states
the
great
leaders
of
secession
were
overthrown
in
a
contest
which
they
courted
and
in
which
they
expected
victory
his
reply
to
hayne
is
perhaps
the
most
masterly
speech
in
american
political
history
it
is
one
of
the
immortal
orations
of
the
world
extorting
praise
and
admiration
from
americans
and
foreigners
alike
in
his
various
encounters
with
hayne
mcduffee
and
calhoun
he
taught
the
principles
of
political
union
to
the
rising
generation
he
produced
those
convictions
which
sustained
the
north
in
its
subsequent
contest
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
nation
there
can
be
no
estimate
of
the
services
he
rendered
to
the
country
by
those
grand
and
patriotic
efforts
but
for
these
the
people
might
have
succumbed
to
the
sophistries
of
calhoun
for
he
was
almost
as
great
a
giant
as
webster
and
was
more
faultless
in
his
private
life
he
had
an
immense
influence
he
ruled
the
whole
south
he
made
it
solid
the
speeches
of
webster
in
the
senate
made
him
the
oracle
of
the
north
he
was
not
only
the
great
champion
of
the
north
and
of
northern
interests
but
he
was
the
teacher
of
the
whole
country
he
expounded
the
principles
of
the
constitution
that
this
great
country
is
one
to
be
forever
united
in
all
its
parts
that
its
stars
and
stripes
were
to
float
over
every
city
and
fortress
in
the
land
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
from
the
river
lawrence
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
bearing
for
their
motto
no
such
miserable
interrogatory
as
what
are
all
these
worth
nor
those
other
words
of
delusion
and
folly
liberty
first
and
union
afterwards
but
that
other
sentiment
dear
to
every
american
heart
liberty
and
union
now
and
forever
one
and
inseparable
it
was
after
his
memorable
speech
in
reply
to
hayne
that
i
saw
webster
for
the
first
time
i
was
a
boy
in
college
and
he
had
come
to
visit
it
and
well
do
i
remember
the
unbounded
admiration
yea
the
veneration
felt
for
him
by
every
young
man
in
that
college
and
throughout
the
town
indeed
throughout
the
whole
north
for
he
was
the
pride
and
glory
of
the
land
it
was
then
that
they
called
him
godlike
looking
like
an
olympian
statue
or
one
of
the
creations
of
michael
angelo
when
he
wished
to
represent
majesty
and
dignity
and
power
in
repose
the
most
commanding
human
presence
ever
seen
in
the
capitol
at
washington
when
we
recall
those
patriotic
and
noble
speeches
which
were
read
and
admired
by
every
merchant
and
farmer
and
lawyer
in
the
country
and
by
which
he
produced
great
convictions
and
taught
great
lessons
we
can
not
but
wonder
why
his
glory
was
dimmed
and
he
was
pulled
down
from
his
pedestal
and
became
no
longer
an
idol
it
is
affirmed
by
many
that
it
was
his
famous
of
march
speech
which
killed
him
which
disappointed
his
friends
and
alienated
his
constituents
i
am
therefore
compelled
to
say
something
about
that
speech
and
of
his
history
at
that
time
webster
was
doubtless
an
ambitious
man
he
aspired
to
the
presidency
and
why
not
it
is
and
will
be
a
great
dignity
such
as
ought
to
be
conferred
on
great
ability
and
patriotism
was
he
not
able
and
patriotic
had
he
not
rendered
great
services
was
he
not
universally
admired
for
his
genius
and
experience
and
wisdom
who
was
more
prominent
than
he
among
the
statesmen
of
the
country
or
more
thoroughly
fitted
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
that
high
office
was
it
not
natural
that
he
should
have
aspired
to
be
one
of
the
successors
of
washington
and
adams
and
jefferson
he
comprehended
the
honor
and
the
dignity
of
that
office
he
did
not
seek
it
in
order
to
divide
its
spoils
or
to
reward
his
friends
but
he
did
wish
to
secure
the
highest
prize
that
could
be
won
by
political
services
he
did
desire
to
receive
the
highest
honor
in
the
gift
of
the
people
even
as
cicero
sought
the
consulate
at
rome
he
did
believe
himself
capable
of
representing
the
country
in
its
most
exacting
position
it
is
nothing
against
a
man
that
he
is
ambitious
provided
his
ambition
is
lofty
most
of
the
illustrious
men
of
history
have
been
ambitious
cromwell
pitt
thiers
guizot
bismarck
but
ambitious
to
be
useful
to
their
country
as
well
as
to
receive
its
highest
rewards
webster
failed
to
reach
the
position
he
desired
because
of
his
enemies
and
possibly
from
jealousy
of
his
towering
height
just
as
clay
failed
and
aaron
burr
and
alexander
hamilton
and
stephen
douglas
and
william
seward
the
politicians
who
control
the
people
prefer
men
in
the
presidential
chair
whom
they
think
they
can
manage
and
use
not
those
to
whom
they
will
be
forced
to
succumb
webster
was
not
a
man
to
be
controlled
or
used
and
so
the
politicians
rejected
him
this
he
deeply
felt
and
even
resented
his
failure
saddened
his
latter
days
and
embittered
his
soul
although
he
was
too
proud
to
make
loud
complaints
i
grant
he
did
not
here
show
magnanimity
he
thought
that
the
presidency
should
be
given
to
the
ablest
and
most
experienced
statesman
he
did
not
appear
to
see
that
this
proud
position
is
too
commanding
to
be
bestowed
except
for
the
most
exalted
services
and
such
services
as
attract
the
common
eye
especially
in
war
presidents
in
so
great
a
country
as
this
reign
like
the
old
feudal
kings
by
the
grace
of
god
they
are
selected
by
divine
providence
as
david
was
from
the
sheepfold
no
american
however
great
his
genius
except
the
successful
warrior
can
ever
hope
to
climb
to
this
dizzy
height
unless
personal
ambition
is
lost
sight
of
in
public
services
this
is
wisely
ordered
to
defeat
unscrupulous
ambition
it
is
only
in
england
that
a
man
can
rise
to
supreme
power
by
force
of
genius
since
he
is
selected
virtually
by
his
peers
and
not
by
the
popular
voice
he
who
leads
parliament
is
the
real
king
of
england
for
the
time
since
parliament
is
omnipotent
had
webster
been
an
englishman
and
as
powerful
in
the
house
of
commons
as
he
was
in
congress
at
one
time
he
might
have
been
prime
minister
but
he
could
not
be
president
of
the
united
states
although
the
presidential
power
is
much
inferior
to
that
exercised
by
an
english
premier
it
is
the
dignity
of
the
office
not
its
power
which
constitutes
the
value
of
the
presidency
and
webster
loved
dignity
even
more
than
power
in
order
to
arrive
at
this
coveted
office
although
its
duties
probably
would
have
been
irksome
it
is
possible
that
he
sought
to
conciliate
the
south
and
win
the
favor
of
southern
leaders
but
i
do
not
believe
he
ever
sought
to
win
their
favor
by
any
abandonment
of
his
former
principles
or
by
any
treachery
to
the
cause
he
had
espoused
yet
it
is
this
of
which
he
has
been
accused
by
his
enemies
many
of
those
enemies
his
former
friends
the
real
cause
of
this
estrangement
and
of
all
the
accusations
against
him
was
this
he
did
not
sympathize
with
the
abolition
party
he
was
not
prepared
to
embark
in
a
crusade
against
slavery
the
basal
institution
of
the
south
he
did
not
like
slavery
but
he
knew
it
to
be
an
institution
which
the
constitution
of
which
he
was
the
great
defender
had
accepted
accepted
as
a
compromise
in
those
dark
days
which
tried
men
souls
many
of
the
famous
statesmen
who
deliberated
in
that
venerated
hall
in
philadelphia
also
disliked
and
detested
slavery
but
they
could
not
have
had
a
constitution
they
could
not
have
had
a
united
country
unless
that
institution
was
acknowledged
and
guaranteed
so
they
accepted
it
as
the
lesser
evil
they
made
a
compromise
and
the
constitution
was
signed
now
everybody
knows
that
the
abolitionists
of
the
north
about
the
year
attacked
slavery
although
it
was
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
attacked
it
not
as
an
evil
merely
but
as
a
sin
attacked
it
by
virtue
of
a
higher
law
than
constitutional
provision
and
as
an
evil
as
a
stain
on
our
country
as
an
insult
to
the
virtue
and
intelligence
of
the
age
as
a
crime
against
humanity
these
people
of
the
north
declared
that
slavery
ought
to
be
swept
away
webster
as
well
as
fillmore
lincoln
everett
and
many
other
acknowledged
patriots
was
for
letting
slavery
alone
as
an
evil
too
great
to
be
removed
without
war
which
moreover
could
not
be
removed
without
an
infringement
on
what
the
south
considered
as
its
rights
he
was
for
conciliation
in
order
to
preserve
the
constitution
as
well
as
the
union
the
abolitionists
were
violent
in
their
denunciations
and
although
it
took
many
years
to
permeate
the
north
with
their
leaven
they
were
in
earnest
and
under
persecutions
and
mobs
and
ostracism
and
contempt
they
persevered
until
they
created
a
terrible
public
opinion
the
south
had
early
taken
the
alarm
and
in
order
to
protect
their
peculiar
and
favorite
institution
had
at
various
times
attempted
to
extend
it
into
newly
acquired
territories
where
it
did
not
exist
claiming
the
protection
of
the
constitution
webster
was
one
of
their
foremost
opponents
in
this
contesting
their
right
to
do
it
under
the
constitution
but
in
the
antislavery
opinion
at
the
north
crystallized
in
a
political
organization
the
party
and
on
the
other
hand
the
south
proposed
to
abrogate
the
missouri
compromise
of
as
an
offset
to
the
admission
of
california
as
a
free
state
and
at
the
same
time
asked
in
further
concession
the
passage
of
the
fugitive
slave
bill
and
in
anticipation
of
failing
to
get
these
threatened
secession
which
of
course
meant
war
it
was
at
this
crisis
that
webster
delivered
his
celebrated
of
march
speech
in
many
respects
his
greatest
in
which
he
advocated
conciliation
and
adherence
to
the
constitution
but
which
was
represented
to
support
southern
interests
which
all
his
life
he
had
opposed
and
more
to
advocate
these
interests
in
order
to
secure
southern
votes
for
the
presidency
some
of
the
rich
and
influential
men
of
boston
who
disliked
webster
for
other
reasons
for
he
used
to
snub
them
even
after
they
had
lent
him
money
made
the
most
they
could
of
that
speech
to
alienate
the
people
the
abolitionists
at
last
hostile
to
webster
who
stood
in
their
way
and
would
not
adopt
their
dictation
or
advice
also
bitterly
denounced
this
speech
until
it
finally
came
to
be
regarded
by
the
common
people
few
of
whom
ever
read
it
as
a
very
unpatriotic
production
entirely
at
variance
with
the
views
that
webster
formerly
advanced
and
they
forsook
him
now
what
is
the
real
gist
and
spirit
of
that
speech
the
passions
which
agitated
the
country
when
it
was
delivered
have
passed
away
and
not
only
can
we
now
calmly
criticise
it
but
people
will
listen
to
the
criticism
with
all
the
attention
it
deserves
it
is
my
opinion
shared
by
peter
harvey
and
other
friends
of
webster
that
in
no
speech
he
ever
made
are
patriotic
and
union
sentiments
more
fully
avowed
said
he
with
fiery
emphasis
i
hear
with
distress
and
anguish
the
word
secession
peaceable
secession
sir
your
eyes
and
mine
are
never
destined
to
see
that
miracle
the
dismemberment
of
this
great
country
without
convulsion
the
breaking
up
the
fountains
of
the
great
deep
without
ruffling
the
surface
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
peaceable
secession
it
is
an
utter
impossibility
is
this
great
constitution
under
which
we
live
to
be
melted
and
thawed
away
by
secession
as
the
snows
on
the
mountains
are
melted
away
under
the
influence
of
the
vernal
sun
no
sir
i
see
as
plainly
as
the
sun
in
the
heavens
what
that
disruption
must
produce
i
see
it
must
produce
war
peaceable
secession
peaceable
secession
what
would
be
the
result
where
is
the
line
to
be
drawn
what
states
are
to
secede
what
is
to
remain
american
what
am
i
to
be
am
i
to
be
an
american
no
longer
a
sectional
man
a
local
man
a
separatist
with
no
country
in
common
heaven
forbid
where
is
the
flag
of
the
union
to
remain
where
is
the
eagle
still
to
tower
what
is
to
become
of
the
army
what
is
to
become
of
the
navy
what
is
to
become
of
the
public
lands
how
is
each
of
the
thirty
states
to
defend
itself
will
you
cut
the
mississippi
in
two
leaving
free
states
on
its
branches
and
slave
states
at
its
mouth
can
any
one
suppose
that
this
population
on
its
banks
can
be
severed
by
a
line
that
divides
them
from
the
territory
of
a
foreign
and
alien
government
down
somewhere
the
lord
knows
where
upon
the
lower
branches
of
the
mississippi
sir
i
dislike
to
pursue
this
subject
i
have
utter
disgust
for
it
i
would
rather
hear
of
national
blasts
and
mildews
and
pestilence
and
famine
than
hear
gentlemen
talk
about
secession
to
break
up
this
great
government
to
dismember
this
glorious
country
to
astonish
europe
with
an
act
of
folly
such
as
europe
for
two
centuries
has
never
beheld
in
any
government
no
sir
such
talk
is
enough
to
make
the
bones
of
andrew
jackson
turn
round
in
his
coffin
now
what
are
we
to
think
of
these
sentiments
drawn
from
the
of
march
speech
so
disgracefully
misrepresented
by
the
politicians
and
the
fanatics
do
they
sound
like
bidding
for
southern
votes
can
any
union
sentiments
be
stronger
can
anything
be
more
decided
or
more
patriotic
he
warns
he
entreats
he
predicts
like
a
prophet
he
proves
that
secession
is
incompatible
with
national
existence
he
sees
nothing
in
it
but
war
and
of
all
things
he
dreaded
and
hated
it
was
war
he
knew
what
war
meant
he
knew
that
a
civil
war
would
be
the
direst
calamity
he
would
ward
it
off
he
would
be
conciliating
he
would
take
away
the
excuse
of
war
by
adhering
to
the
constitution
the
written
constitution
which
our
fathers
framed
and
which
has
been
the
admiration
of
the
world
under
which
we
have
advanced
to
prosperity
and
glory
as
no
nation
ever
before
advanced
but
a
large
class
regarded
the
constitution
as
unsound
in
some
respects
a
wicked
constitution
since
it
recognized
slavery
as
an
institution
by
the
higher
law
they
would
sweep
slavery
away
perhaps
by
moral
means
but
by
endless
agitations
until
it
was
destroyed
webster
i
confess
did
not
like
those
agitations
since
he
knew
they
would
end
in
war
he
had
a
great
insight
such
as
few
people
had
at
that
time
but
his
prophetic
insight
was
just
what
a
large
class
of
people
did
not
like
especially
in
his
own
state
he
uttered
disagreeable
truths
as
all
prophets
do
and
they
took
up
stones
to
stone
him
to
stone
him
for
the
bravest
act
of
his
whole
life
in
which
a
transcendent
wisdom
appeared
and
which
will
be
duly
honored
when
the
truth
shall
be
seen
the
fact
was
at
that
time
webster
seemed
to
be
a
croaker
a
jeremiah
as
burke
at
one
time
seemed
to
his
generation
when
he
denounced
the
recklessness
of
the
french
revolution
very
few
people
at
the
north
dreamed
of
war
it
was
never
supposed
that
the
southern
leaders
would
actually
become
rebels
and
they
on
the
other
hand
never
dreamed
that
the
north
would
rise
up
solidly
and
put
them
down
and
if
war
were
to
happen
it
was
supposed
that
it
would
be
brief
even
so
great
and
sagacious
a
statesman
as
seward
thought
this
the
south
thought
that
it
could
easily
whip
the
yankees
and
the
north
thought
that
it
could
suppress
a
southern
rebellion
in
six
weeks
both
sides
miscalculated
and
so
in
spite
of
warnings
the
nation
drifted
into
war
but
as
it
turned
out
in
the
end
it
seems
a
providential
event
the
way
god
took
to
break
up
slavery
the
root
and
source
of
all
our
sectional
animosities
a
terrible
but
apparently
necessary
catastrophe
since
more
than
a
million
of
brave
men
perished
and
more
than
five
thousand
millions
of
dollars
were
spent
had
the
north
been
wise
it
would
have
compensated
the
south
for
its
slaves
had
the
south
been
wise
it
would
have
accepted
the
compensation
and
set
them
free
but
it
was
not
to
be
that
issue
could
only
be
settled
by
the
most
terrible
contest
of
modern
times
i
will
not
dwell
on
that
war
which
webster
predicted
and
dreaded
i
only
wish
to
show
that
it
was
not
for
want
of
patriotism
that
he
became
unpopular
but
because
he
did
not
fall
in
with
the
prevailing
passions
of
the
day
or
with
the
public
sentiment
of
the
north
in
reference
to
slavery
not
as
to
its
evils
and
wickedness
but
as
to
the
way
in
which
it
was
to
be
opposed
the
great
reforms
of
england
since
the
accession
of
william
have
been
effected
by
using
constitutional
means
not
violence
not
revolution
not
war
but
by
an
appeal
to
reason
and
intelligence
and
justice
no
reforms
in
any
nation
have
been
greater
and
more
glorious
than
those
of
the
nineteenth
century
all
effected
by
constitutional
methods
webster
vainly
attempted
constitutional
means
he
was
a
lawyer
he
reverenced
the
constitution
with
all
its
compromises
he
would
observe
the
law
of
contracts
yet
no
man
in
the
nation
was
more
impatient
than
he
at
the
threats
of
secession
he
foretold
that
secession
would
lead
to
war
and
if
webster
had
lived
to
see
the
war
of
which
he
had
such
anxious
prescience
i
firmly
believe
that
he
would
have
marched
under
the
banner
of
the
north
with
patriotism
equal
to
any
man
he
would
have
been
where
everett
was
one
of
his
own
sons
was
slain
in
that
war
he
was
not
a
northern
man
with
southern
principles
his
whole
life
attested
his
northern
principles
there
never
was
a
time
when
he
was
not
hated
and
mistrusted
by
the
southern
leaders
it
is
not
a
proof
that
he
was
southern
in
his
sympathies
because
he
was
not
an
abolitionist
and
by
an
abolitionist
i
mean
what
was
meant
thirty
years
ago
one
who
was
unscrupulously
bent
on
removing
slavery
by
any
means
good
or
bad
since
slavery
in
his
eyes
was
a
per
not
a
misfortune
an
evil
a
sin
but
a
crime
to
be
washed
out
by
the
besom
of
destruction
webster
did
not
sympathize
with
these
extreme
views
he
was
not
a
reformer
but
that
does
not
show
that
he
was
unpatriotic
or
a
southern
man
in
his
heart
the
higher
law
to
him
was
the
fulfilment
of
a
contract
the
maintenance
of
promises
made
in
good
faith
whether
those
promises
were
wise
or
foolish
the
observance
of
laws
so
long
as
they
were
laws
there
was
undeniably
a
great
evil
and
shame
to
be
removed
but
he
was
not
responsible
for
it
and
he
left
that
evil
in
the
hands
of
him
who
said
vengeance
is
mine
i
will
repay
as
he
did
repay
in
four
years
devastations
miseries
and
calamities
and
these
so
awful
so
unexpected
so
for
that
a
thoughtful
and
person
in
view
of
them
will
weep
rather
than
rejoice
for
it
is
not
pleasant
to
witness
chastisements
and
punishments
even
if
necessary
and
just
unless
the
people
who
suffer
are
fiends
and
incarnate
devils
as
very
few
men
are
human
nature
is
about
the
same
everywhere
and
individuals
and
nations
peculiarly
sinful
are
generally
made
so
by
their
surroundings
and
circumstances
the
reckless
people
of
frontier
mining
districts
are
not
naturally
worse
than
adventurers
in
new
york
or
philadelphia
nor
is
any
vulgar
and
ignorant
man
in
any
part
of
the
country
suddenly
made
rich
probably
any
coarser
in
his
pleasures
or
more
sensual
in
his
appearance
or
more
profane
in
his
language
than
was
vitellius
or
heliogabalus
or
otho
on
an
imperial
throne
but
even
suppose
webster
in
the
decline
of
his
life
intoxicated
by
his
magnificent
position
or
led
astray
by
ambition
made
serious
political
errors
what
then
all
great
men
have
made
errors
both
in
judgment
and
in
morals
caesar
when
he
crossed
the
rubicon

sun
itself
passes
through
eclipses
as
it
gives
light
to
the
bodies
which
revolve
around
it
even
david
and
peter
stumbled
because
webster
professed
to
know
as
much
of
the
interests
of
the
country
as
the
shoemakers
of
lynn
and
refused
to
be
instructed
in
his
political
duties
by
garrison
and
wendell
phillips
does
he
deserve
eternal
reprobation
because
he
opposed
the
public
sentiments
of
his
constituents
on
one
point
when
perhaps
they
were
right
is
he
to
be
hurled
from
his
lofty
pedestal
are
all
his
services
to
be
forgotten
because
he
did
not
lift
up
his
trumpet
voice
in
favor
of
immediate
emancipation
and
even
suppose
he
sought
to
conciliate
the
south
when
the
south
was
preparing
for
rebellion
is
such
a
dreadful
thing
go
still
farther
suppose
he
wished
to
conciliate
the
south
in
order
to
get
southern
support
for
the
presidency
which
i
grant
he
wanted
and
possibly
sought
is
he
to
be
unforgiven
and
his
name
to
be
blasted
and
he
held
up
to
the
rising
generation
as
a
fallen
man
does
a
man
fall
hopelessly
because
he
stumbles
is
a
man
to
be
dethroned
because
he
is
not
perfect
when
was
webster
vote
ever
bought
and
sold
who
ever
sat
with
more
dignity
in
the
councils
of
the
nation
would
he
have
voted
for
back
pay
would
he
have
bought
a
seat
in
the
senate
even
if
he
had
been
as
rich
as
a
bonanza
king
consider
how
few
errors
webster
really
committed
in
a
public
career
of
nearly
forty
years
consider
the
beneficence
and
wisdom
of
the
measures
which
he
generally
advocated
and
which
would
have
been
lost
but
for
his
eloquence
and
power
consider
the
greatness
and
lustre
of
his
congressional
career
on
the
whole
who
has
proved
a
greater
benefactor
to
this
nation
on
the
floor
of
congress
than
he
i
do
not
wish
to
eulogize
still
less
to
whitewash
so
great
a
man
but
only
to
render
simple
justice
to
his
memory
and
deeds
the
time
has
come
to
lift
the
veil
which
for
thirty
years
has
concealed
his
noble
political
services
the
time
has
come
to
cry
shame
on
those
boys
who
mocked
a
prophet
and
said
go
up
thou
although
no
bears
were
found
to
devour
them
the
time
has
come
for
this
nation
to
bury
the
old
slanders
of
an
exciting
political
warfare
and
render
thanks
for
the
services
performed
by
the
greatest
intellectual
giant
of
the
past
generation
services
rendered
not
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
alone
not
in
the
national
legislature
for
thirty
years
but
in
one
of
the
great
offices
of
state
when
he
made
a
treaty
with
england
which
saved
us
from
an
entangling
war
the
ashburton
treaty
is
the
brightest
gem
in
the
coronet
with
which
he
should
be
crowned
it
was
the
proudest
day
in
webster
life
when
rufus
choate
announced
to
him
one
evening
that
the
senate
had
confirmed
the
treaty
it
was
not
when
he
closed
his
magnificent
argument
in
behalf
of
dartmouth
college
not
when
he
addressed
the
intelligence
of
new
england
at
bunker
hill
not
when
he
demolished
governor
hayne
not
when
he
sat
on
the
woolsack
with
lord
brougham
not
when
he
was
entertained
by
louis
philippe
that
the
proudest
emotions
swelled
in
his
bosom
but
when
he
learned
that
he
had
prevented
a
war
with
england
for
he
knew
that
england
and
america
could
not
afford
to
fight
that
it
would
be
a
fight
where
gain
is
loss
and
glory
is
shame
at
last
worn
out
with
labor
and
disease
and
perhaps
embittered
by
disappointment
and
saddened
to
see
the
increasing
tendency
to
elevate
little
men
to
power
the
grasshoppers
who
make
the
field
ring
with
their
importunate
chinks
while
the
great
cattle
chew
the
cud
and
are
silent
webster
died
at
marshfield
at
seventy
years
of
age
at
the
time
he
was
secretary
of
state
he
died
in
the
consolations
of
a
religion
in
which
he
believed
surrounded
with
loving
friends
and
even
his
enemies
felt
that
a
great
man
in
israel
had
fallen
nothing
then
was
said
of
his
defects
for
great
defects
he
had
a
towering
intellectual
pride
like
chatham
an
austerity
like
gladstone
passions
like
those
of
mirabeau
extravagance
like
that
of
cicero
indifference
to
pecuniary
obligations
like
pitt
and
fox
and
sheridan
but
these
were
overbalanced
by
the
warmth
of
his
affections
for
his
faithful
friends
simplicity
of
manners
and
taste
courteous
treatment
of
opponents
dignity
of
character
kindness
to
the
poor
hospitality
enjoyment
of
rural
scenes
and
sports
profound
religious
instincts
devotion
to
what
he
deemed
the
welfare
of
his
country
independence
of
opinions
and
boldness
in
asserting
them
at
any
hazard
and
against
all
opposition
and
unbounded
contempt
of
all
lies
and
shams
and
tricks
these
traits
will
make
his
memory
dear
to
all
who
knew
him
and
as
florence
too
late
repented
of
her
ingratitude
to
dante
and
appointed
her
most
learned
men
to
expound
the
divine
comedy
when
he
was
dead
so
will
the
writings
of
webster
be
more
and
more
a
study
among
lawyers
and
statesmen
his
fame
will
spread
and
grow
wider
and
greater
like
that
of
bacon
and
burke
and
of
other
benefactors
of
mankind
and
his
ideas
will
not
pass
away
until
the
glorious
fabric
of
american
institutions
whose
foundations
were
laid
by
people
shall
be
utterly
destroyed
and
the
capitol
where
his
noblest
efforts
were
made
shall
become
a
mass
of
broken
and
prostrate
columns
beneath
the
débris
of
the
nation
ruin
no
not
then
shall
they
perish
even
if
such
gloomy
changes
are
possible
any
more
than
the
genius
of
cicero
has
faded
among
the
ruins
of
the
eternal
city
but
they
shall
shine
upon
the
most
distant
works
of
man
since
they
are
drawn
from
the
wisdom
of
all
preceding
generations
and
are

the

and

life
of
webster
is
yet
to
be
written
although
the
most
prominent
of
his
contemporaries
have
had
something
to
say
john
calhoun
the
slavery
question
the
extraordinary
abilities
of
john
calhoun
the
great
influence
he
exerted
as
the
representative
of
southern
interests
in
the
national
legislature
and
especially
his
connection
with
the
slavery
question
make
it
necessary
to
include
him
among
the
statesmen
who
for
evil
or
good
have
powerfully
affected
the
destinies
of
the
united
states
he
is
a
great
historical
character
the
peer
of
webster
and
clay
in
congressional
history
and
more
unsullied
than
either
of
them
in
the
virtues
of
private
life
in
south
carolina
he
was
regarded
as
little
less
than
a
demigod
and
until
the
antislavery
agitation
began
he
was
viewed
as
among
the
foremost
statesmen
of
the
land
his
elevation
to
commanding
influence
in
congress
was
very
rapid
and
but
for
his
identification
with
partisan
interests
and
a
bad
institution
there
was
no
office
in
the
gift
of
the
nation
to
which
he
could
not
reasonably
have
aspired
john
caldwell
calhoun
was
born
in
of
highly
respectable
descent
in
the
abbeville
district
in
south
carolina
he
was
not
a
patrician
according
to
the
ideas
of
rich
planters
he
had
but
a
slender
school
education
in
boyhood
but
was
prepared
for
college
by
a
presbyterian
clergyman
entered
the
junior
class
of
yale
college
in
and
was
graduated
with
high
honors
he
chose
the
law
for
his
profession
studied
laboriously
for
three
years
spending
eighteen
months
at
the
then
famous
law
school
at
litchfield
connecticut
and
gave
great
promise
in
his
remarkable
logical
powers
of
becoming
an
eminent
lawyer
whatever
abilities
calhoun
may
have
had
for
the
law
it
does
not
appear
that
he
practised
it
long
or
to
any
great
extent
his
taste
and
his
genius
inclined
him
to
politics
and
having
married
a
lady
with
some
fortune
he
had
sufficient
means
to
live
without
professional
drudgery
after
serving
a
short
time
in
the
state
legislature
of
south
carolina
he
was
elected
a
member
of
congress
and
took
his
seat
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
at
the
age
of
from
the
very
first
his
voice
was
heard
he
made
a
speech
in
favor
of
raising
ten
thousand
additional
men
to
our
army
to
resist
the
encroachments
of
great
britain
and
prepare
for
hostilities
should
the
country
drift
into
war
it
was
an
able
speech
for
a
young
man
and
its
scornful
repudiation
of
reckoning
the
costs
of
war
against
insult
and
violated
rights
had
a
chivalric
ring
about
it
sir
i
here
enter
my
solemn
protest
against
a
low
and
calculating
avarice
entering
this
hall
of
legislation
it
is
only
fit
for
shops
and
it
is
a
compromising
spirit
always
ready
to
yield
a
part
to
save
the
residue
here
at
an
early
date
we
hear
the
of
his
life
hatred
of
compromises
and
if
it
were
necessary
to
go
to
war
at
all
he
would
fight
regardless
of
expense
thus
calhoun
began
his
public
career
as
an
advocate
of
war
with
great
britain
the
old
revolutionary
sores
had
not
yet
had
time
to
heal
and
there
was
general
hostility
to
england
except
among
the
virginia
aristocrats
and
the
federalists
of
the
north
although
a
young
man
calhoun
was
placed
upon
the
important
committee
of
foreign
affairs
of
which
he
was
soon
made
chairman
calhoun
early
speeches
in
congress
gave
promise
of
rare
abilities
the
most
able
of
them
were
those
on
the
repeal
of
the
embargo
in
on
the
commercial
convention
with
great
britain
in
on
the
united
states
bank
bill
and
the
tariff
the
same
year
and
on
the
internal
improvement
bill
in
the
main
subject
which
occupied
congress
from
to
was
the
war
with
great
britain
during
the
administration
of
madison
and
afterwards
till
the
great
questions
at
issue
were
in
reference
to
tariffs
and
internal
improvements
in
the
discussion
of
these
subjects
calhoun
took
broad
and
patriotic
ground
at
that
time
we
see
no
sectional
interests
predominating
in
his
mind
he
favored
internal
improvements
great
permanent
roads
and
even
the
protection
of
manufactures
and
a
national
bank
on
all
these
questions
his
sectional
interests
at
a
later
day
led
him
to
support
the
exact
opposite
of
these
early
national
views
says
von
holst
his
speech
on
the
new
tariff
bill
april
was
a
long
and
carefully
prepared
argument
in
favor
of
the
whole
economical
platform
on
which
the
whig
party
stood
to
the
last
day
of
its
existence
even
henry
clay
and
horace
greeley
have
not
been
able
to
put
their
favorite
doctrine
into
stronger
language
his
final
aim
was
the
industrial
independence
of
the
united
states
from
europe
and
this
he
thought
could
be
obtained
by
protective
duties
calhoun
speeches
during
the
six
years
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
were
so
able
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
nation
and
in
monroe
selected
him
as
his
secretary
of
war
and
he
made
a
good
executive
officer
in
this
branch
of
the
public
service
putting
things
to
rights
and
bringing
order
out
of
confusion
living
on
terms
of
friendship
with
john
quincy
adams
and
other
members
of
the
cabinet
planning
military
roads
introducing
a
system
of
strict
economy
in
his
department
and
making
salutary
reforms
he
tolerated
no
abuses
he
was
disposed
to
do
justice
to
the
indians
and
raise
them
from
their
degradation
even
seeking
to
educate
them
when
it
was
more
than
probable
that
they
would
return
to
their
barbaric
habits
a
race
as
it
would
seem
from
experience
very
difficult
to
civilize
adams
thus
spoke
of
his
young
colleague
calhoun
is
a
man
of
fair
and
candid
mind
of
honorable
principles
of
quick
and
clear
understanding
of
cool
of
enlarged
philosophical
views
and
of
ardent
patriotism
he
is
above
all
sectional
and
factious
prejudices
more
than
any
other
statesman
of
this
union
with
whom
i
have
ever
acted
a
very
different
verdict
from
what
he
wrote
in
his
diary
in
judge
story
wrote
of
him
in
in
these
terms
i
have
great
admiration
for
calhoun
and
think
few
men
have
more
enlarged
and
liberal
views
of
the
true
policy
of
the
national
government
the
post
he
held
however
was
not
calhoun
true
arena
but
one
which
an
ambitious
young
man
of
could
not
well
decline
from
the
honor
it
brought
the
secretaryship
of
war
is
the
least
important
of
all
the
cabinet
offices
in
time
of
peace
and
was
especially
so
when
the
army
was
reduced
to
six
thousand
men
its
functions
amounted
to
little
more
than
sending
small
detachments
to
military
posts
making
contracts
for
the
commissariat
visiting
occasionally
the
forts
and
fortifications
and
making
a
figure
in
washington
society
it
furnished
no
field
for
extensive
operations
or
the
exercise
of
remarkable
qualities
of
mind
but
inasmuch
as
it
made
calhoun
a
member
of
the
cabinet
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
express
his
mind
on
all
national
issues
and
exercise
an
influence
on
the
president
himself
it
did
not
make
him
prominent
in
the
eyes
of
the
nation
he
was
simply
the
head
of
a
bureau
although
an
important
personage
in
the
eyes
of
the
cadets
of
west
point
and
of
some
lazy
lieutenants
stationed
among
the
indians
but
whatever
the
part
he
was
required
to
play
he
did
his
duty
showed
ability
and
won
confidence
he
doubtless
added
to
his
reputation
else
he
would
not
have
been
talked
about
as
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
selected
as
a
candidate
for
the
and
chosen
to
that
position
by
northern
votes
as
he
was
in
when
the
election
was
thrown
into
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
friends
of
henry
clay
made
adams
instead
of
jackson
president
calhoun
popularity
with
all
parties
resulted
in
his
election
as
by
a
very
large
popular
vote
he
deserved
it
the
day
had
not
come
for
the
ascendency
of
mere
politicians
and
their
division
of
the
spoils
of
office
the
condition
of
the
slaveholding
states
at
this
period
was
most
prosperous
the
culture
of
cotton
had
become
exceedingly
lucrative
rich
planters
spent
their
summers
at
the
north
in
luxurious
independence
it
was
the
era
of
general
good
feeling
no
agitating
questions
had
arisen
young
men
at
the
south
sought
education
in
the
new
england
colleges
manufacturing
interests
were
in
their
infancy
and
had
not
as
yet
excited
southern
jealousy
commercial
prosperity
in
new
england
was
the
main
object
desired
although
the
war
with
great
britain
had
proved
disastrous
to
it
political
influence
seemed
to
centre
in
the
southern
states
these
states
had
furnished
four
presidents
out
of
five
the
great
west
had
not
arisen
in
its
might
it
had
no
great
cities
but
charleston
and
boston
were
centres
of
culture
and
wealth
and
on
good
terms
with
each
other
both
equally
free
from
agitating
questions
and
both
equally
benignant
to
the
institution
of
slavery
which
the
constitution
was
supposed
to
have
made
secure
forever
the
adams
administration
was
notable
for
nothing
but
beginnings
of
the
tariff
question
and
the
protectionist
act
of
the
growth
of
the
democratic
party
the
final
intensity
of
the
presidential
campaign
of
and
the
election
of
jackson
with
calhoun
as
as
the
incumbent
of
this
office
for
two
terms
calhoun
did
not
make
a
great
mark
in
history
his
office
was
one
of
dignity
and
not
of
power
but
during
his
important
discussions
took
place
in
congress
which
placed
him
as
presiding
officer
of
the
senate
in
an
embarrassing
position
he
was
between
two
fires
and
gradually
became
alienated
from
the
two
opposing
parties
to
whom
he
owed
his
election
he
could
go
neither
with
adams
nor
with
jackson
on
public
measures
and
both
interfered
with
his
aspirations
for
the
presidency
his
personal
relations
with
jackson
who
had
been
his
warm
friend
and
supporter
became
strained
after
his
second
election
as
he
took
part
against
jackson
in
the
president
undignified
attempt
to
force
his
cabinet
to
recognize
the
social
position
of
eaton
further
it
was
divulged
by
crawford
who
had
been
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
cabinet
when
calhoun
was
secretary
of
war
that
the
latter
had
in
favored
a
censure
of
jackson
for
his
unauthorized
seizure
of
spanish
territory
in
the
florida
campaign
during
the
seminole
war
and
this
increased
the
growing
animosity
what
had
been
an
alienation
between
the
two
highest
officers
of
the
government
ripened
into
intense
hatred
which
was
fatal
to
the
aspirations
of
calhoun
for
the
presidency
for
no
man
could
be
president
against
the
overpowering
influence
of
jackson
this
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
calhoun
for
he
had
set
his
heart
on
being
the
successor
of
jackson
in
the
presidential
chair
there
were
two
subjects
which
had
arisen
to
great
importance
during
calhoun
terms
of
executive
office
which
not
only
blasted
his
prospects
for
the
presidency
but
separated
him
forever
from
his
former
friends
and
allies
one
of
these
was
the
tariff
question
which
gave
him
great
uneasiness
he
opened
his
eyes
to
see
that
protection
and
internal
improvements
so
ably
advocated
by
henry
clay
and
even
by
himself
in
were
becoming
the
policy
of
the
government
to
the
enriching
of
the
north
true
it
was
only
an
economical
question
but
it
seemed
to
him
to
lay
the
axe
to
the
root
of
southern
prosperity
it
was
his
settled
conviction
that
tariffs
for
protection
would
increase
the
burdens
of
the
south
by
raising
the
price
of
all
those
articles
which
it
was
compelled
to
buy
and
that
large
profits
on
articles
manufactured
in
the
united
states
would
only
enrich
the
northern
manufacturers
the
south
being
an
agricultural
country
exclusively
naturally
sought
to
buy
in
the
cheapest
market
and
therefore
wanted
no
tariff
except
for
revenue
when
calhoun
saw
that
protectionist
duties
were
an
injury
to
the
slaveholding
states
he
reversed
entirely
his
former
opinions
and
what
influence
he
could
exert
as
the
presiding
officer
of
the
senate
was
now
displayed
against
the
adams
party
which
had
favored
his
election
to
the
and
of
course
alienated
his
northern
supporters
especially
adams
who
now
turned
against
him
and
as
bitterly
denounced
as
once
he
had
favored
and
praised
him
calhoun
had
now
both
the
jackson
and
adams
parties
against
him
though
for
different
reasons
up
to
this
time
until
the
agitation
of
the
tariff
question
began
calhoun
had
not
been
a
party
man
he
was
regarded
throughout
the
country
as
a
statesman
rather
than
as
a
politician
but
when
manufactures
of
cotton
and
woollen
goods
were
being
established
in
lowell
lawrence
dover
great
falls
and
other
places
in
new
england
wherever
there
was
a
to
turn
the
mills
it
became
obvious
that
a
new
tariff
would
be
imposed
to
protect
these
infant
industries
and
manufacturing
interests
everywhere
the
tariff
of
had
borne
heavily
on
the
south
producing
great
irritation
and
very
naturally
the
planters
complained
that
they
had
to
bear
all
the
burdens
of
protection
without
enjoying
its
benefits
that
the
things
they
had
to
buy
had
become
dearer
while
the
things
produced
and
exported
found
a
less
market
financial
ruin
stared
them
in
the
face
it
seemed
to
them
a
great
injustice
that
the
interests
of
the
planters
should
be
sacrificed
to
the
monopolists
of
the
north
in
the
defence
of
southern
interests
calhoun
in
the
senate
at
first
appealed
to
reason
and
patriotism
it
is
true
that
he
now
became
a
partisan
but
he
had
been
sent
to
congress
as
the
champion
of
the
cotton
lords
he
was
no
more
unpatriotic
than
webster
who
at
first
as
the
representative
of
the
merchants
of
boston
advocated
freer
trade
in
the
interests
of
commerce
and
afterwards
as
the
representative
of
massachusetts
at
large
turned
round
and
advocated
protective
duties
for
the
benefit
of
the
manufacturer
it
is
a
nice
question
as
to
where
a
congressman
should
draw
the
line
of
advocacy
between
local
and
general
interests
what
are
men
sent
to
congress
for
except
to
advance
the
interests
intrusted
to
them
by
their
constituents
when
are
these
to
be
merged
in
national
considerations
calhoun
mission
was
to
protect
southern
interests
and
he
defended
them
with
admirable
logical
power
he
was
one
of
three
great
masters
of
debate
in
the
senate
no
one
could
reasonably
blame
him
for
the
opinions
he
advanced
for
he
had
a
right
to
them
and
if
he
took
sectional
ground
he
did
as
most
party
leaders
do
it
was
merely
a
congressional
fight
but
when
after
the
tariff
of
it
appeared
to
calhoun
that
there
was
no
remedy
that
protection
had
become
the
avowed
and
permanent
policy
of
the
government
that
the
tobacco
and
cotton
of
the
south
being
the
chief
bulk
of
our
exports
were
paying
tribute
to
northern
manufactures
which
were
growing
strong
under
protection
of
federal
taxes
on
competing
imports
and
that
the
south
was
menaced
with
financial
ruin
he
took
a
new
departure
the
first
serious
political
error
of
his
life
and
became
disloyal
to
the
union
in
july
he
made
an
elaborate
address
to
the
people
of
south
carolina
in
which
discussing
the
theoretical
relations
of
the
states
to
the
union
he
put
forth
the
doctrine
that
any
state
could
nullify
the
laws
of
congress
when
it
deemed
them
unconstitutional
as
he
regarded
the
existing
tariff
to
be
he
looked
upon
the
state
rather
than
the
union
of
states
as
supreme
and
declared
that
the
state
could
secede
if
the
union
enforced
unconstitutional
measures
this
as
von
hoist
points
out
practically
meant
that
whenever
different
views
are
entertained
about
the
powers
conferred
by
the
constitution
upon
the
federal
government
those
of
the
were
to
prevail
an
evident
absurdity
under
a
republican
government
in
june
was
passed
another
tariff
bill
offering
some
reductions
but
still
based
on
protection
as
the
underlying
principle
in
consequence
south
carolina
entirely
subservient
to
the
influence
of
calhoun
who
in
august
issued
another
manifesto
passed
in
november
the
nullification
ordinance
to
take
effect
the
following
february
as
already
recited
president
jackson
took
the
most
vigorous
measures
sustained
by
congress
and
gave
the
nullifiers
clearly
to
understand
that
if
they
resisted
the
laws
of
the
united
states
the
whole
power
of
the
government
would
be
arrayed
against
them
they
received
the
proclamation
defiantly
and
the
governor
issued
a
counter
one
it
was
in
this
crisis
that
calhoun
resigned
the
and
was
immediately
elected
to
the
united
states
senate
where
he
could
fight
more
advantageously
then
the
president
sent
a
message
to
congress
requesting
new
powers
to
put
down
the
nullifiers
by
force
should
the
necessity
arrive
which
were
granted
for
he
was
now
at
the
height
of
his
popularity
and
influence
the
nullifiers
enraged
him
and
though
they
abstained
from
resorting
to
extreme
measures
they
continued
their
threats
the
country
appeared
to
be
on
the
verge
of
war
the
party
leaders
felt
the
necessity
of
a
compromise
and
henry
clay
brought
forward
in
the
senate
a
bill
which
in
march
became
a
law
which
reduced
the
tariff
it
apparently
appeased
the
south
not
yet
prepared
to
go
out
of
the
union
and
the
storm
blew
over
there
was
no
doubt
however
that
had
the
south
carolinians
resisted
the
government
with
force
of
arms
they
would
have
been
put
down
for
jackson
was
both
infuriated
and
firm
he
had
even
threatened
to
hang
calhoun
as
high
as
haman
an
absurd
threat
for
he
had
no
power
to
hang
anybody
except
one
with
arms
in
his
hands
and
then
only
through
due
process
of
law
while
calhoun
was
a
senator
as
yet
using
only
legitimate
means
to
gain
his
ends
in
the
compromise
which
clay
effected
the
south
had
the
best
of
the
bargain
and
in
view
of
it
the
culmination
of
the
irrepressible
conflict
was
delayed
nearly
thirty
years
calhoun
himself
maintained
that
the
compromise
tariff
of
was
due
to
the
resistance
which
his
state
had
made
but
he
also
felt
that
the
force
bill
with
which
congress
had
backed
up
the
president
was
a
standing
menace
and
as
usual
with
him
he
looked
forward
to
impending
dangers
the
compromise
tariff
which
reduced
duties
to
twenty
per
cent
in
the
main
and
made
provision
for
still
further
reduction
found
great
opponents
in
the
senate
and
was
regarded
by
webster
as
anything
but
a
protection
bill
nor
was
calhoun
altogether
satisfied
with
it
it
was
received
with
favor
by
the
country
generally
however
and
south
carolina
repealed
her
nullification
ordinance
that
subject
being
disposed
of
for
the
present
the
attention
of
congress
and
the
country
was
now
turned
to
the
president
war
on
the
united
states
bank
as
this
most
important
matter
has
already
been
treated
in
the
lecture
on
jackson
i
have
only
to
show
the
course
calhoun
took
in
reference
to
it
he
was
now
years
old
in
the
prime
of
his
life
and
the
full
vigor
of
his
powers
in
the
senate
he
had
but
two
peers
clay
and
webster
and
was
not
in
sympathy
with
either
of
them
though
not
in
decided
hostility
as
he
was
toward
jackson
he
was
now
neither
whig
nor
democrat
but
a
south
carolinian
having
in
view
the
welfare
of
the
south
alone
of
whose
interests
he
was
the
recognized
guardian
it
was
only
when
questions
arose
which
did
not
directly
bear
on
southern
interests
that
he
was
the
candid
and
patriotic
statesman
sometimes
voting
with
one
party
and
sometimes
with
another
he
was
opposed
to
the
removal
of
deposits
from
the
united
states
bank
and
yet
was
opposed
to
a
renewal
of
its
charter
his
leading
idea
in
reference
to
the
matter
was
the
necessity
of
divorcing
the
government
altogether
from
the
banking
system
as
a
dangerous
which
might
be
perverted
to
political
purposes
in
pointing
out
the
dangers
he
spoke
with
great
power
and
astuteness
for
he
was
always
on
the
for
breakers
he
therefore
argued
against
the
removal
of
deposits
as
an
unwarrantable
assumption
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
president
which
could
not
be
constitutionally
exercised
here
he
agreed
with
his
great
rivals
while
he
was
more
moderate
than
they
in
his
language
he
made
war
on
measures
rather
than
on
men
personally
regarding
the
latter
as
of
temporary
importance
of
passing
interest
so
far
as
the
removal
of
deposits
seemed
an
arbitrary
act
on
the
part
of
the
executive
he
severely
denounced
it
as
done
with
a
view
to
grasp
unconstitutional
power
for
party
purposes
thus
corrupting
the
country
and
as
a
measure
to
get
control
of
money
said
he
with
money
we
will
get
partisans
with
partisans
votes
and
with
votes
money
is
the
maxim
of
our
political
pilferers
he
regarded
the
measure
as
a
part
of
the
spoils
system
which
marked
jackson
departure
from
the
policy
of
his
predecessors
calhoun
detested
the
system
of
making
politics
a
game
since
it
would
throw
the
government
into
the
hands
of
political
adventurers
and
mere
he
was
too
lofty
a
man
to
encourage
anything
like
this
and
here
we
are
compelled
to
do
him
honor
whatever
he
said
or
did
was
in
obedience
to
his
convictions
he
was
above
and
beyond
all
deceit
and
trickery
and
personal
selfishness
his
contempt
for
political
amounted
almost
to
loathing
he
was
incapable
of
doing
a
mean
thing
he
might
be
wrong
in
his
views
and
hence
might
do
evil
instead
of
good
but
he
was
honest
in
his
severe
and
cold
dignity
of
character
he
resembled
william
pitt
his
integrity
was
peerless
he
could
neither
be
bought
nor
seduced
from
his
course
private
considerations
had
no
weight
with
him
except
his
aspiration
for
the
presidency
and
even
that
seems
to
have
passed
away
when
his
disagreement
with
jackson
put
him
out
of
the
democratic
race
and
when
the
new
crisis
arose
in
southern
interests
to
which
he
ever
after
devoted
himself
with
entire
in
moral
character
calhoun
was
as
reproachless
as
washington
he
neither
drank
to
excess
nor
gambled
nor
violated
the
seventh
commandment
he
had
no
fellowship
with
either
fools
or
knaves
he
believed
that
the
office
of
senator
was
the
highest
to
which
americans
could
ordinarily
attain
and
he
gave
dignity
to
it
and
felt
its
responsibilities
he
thought
that
only
the
best
and
most
capable
men
should
be
elevated
to
that
post
nor
would
he
seek
it
by
unworthy
ends
the
office
sought
him
not
he
the
office
it
was
this
pure
and
exalted
character
which
gave
him
such
an
ascendency
at
the
south
as
much
as
his
marvellous
logical
powers
and
his
devotion
to
southern
interests
his
constituents
believed
in
him
and
followed
him
perhaps
blindly
therefore
when
we
consider
what
are
generally
acknowledged
as
his
mistakes
we
should
bear
in
mind
the
palliating
circumstances
calhoun
was
the
incarnation
of
southern
public
opinion
bigoted
narrow
prejudiced
but
intense
in
its
delusions
and
loyal
to
its
dogmas
hence
he
enslaved
others
as
he
was
himself
enslaved
he
was
alike
the
idol
and
the
leader
of
his
state
impossible
to
be
dethroned
as
webster
was
with
the
people
of
massachusetts
until
he
misrepresented
their
convictions
the
consistency
of
his
career
was
marvellous
not
that
he
did
not
change
some
of
his
opinions
for
there
is
no
intellectual
progress
to
a
man
who
does
not
how
can
a
young
man
however
gifted
be
infallible
but
whatever
the
changes
through
which
his
mind
passed
they
did
not
result
from
or
ambition
but
were
the
result
of
more
enlightened
views
and
enlarged
experience
political
wisdom
is
not
a
natural
instinct
but
a
progressive
growth
like
that
of
burke
the
profoundest
of
all
the
intellects
of
his
generation
calhoun
made
several
great
speeches
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
besides
those
in
reference
to
a
banking
system
connected
with
the
government
which
whether
wise
or
erroneous
contained
some
important
truths
but
the
logical
deduction
of
them
all
may
be
summed
up
in
one
idea
the
supremacy
of
state
rights
in
opposition
to
a
central
government
this
from
the
time
when
the
diverging
interests
of
the
north
and
the
south
made
him
feel
the
dangers
in
the
unchecked
will
of
a
majority
of
the
whole
was
the
dogma
of
his
life
from
which
he
never
swerved
and
which
he
pursued
to
all
its
legitimate
conclusions
whatever
measure
tended
to
the
consolidation
of
central
power
whether
in
reference
to
the
encroachments
of
the
executive
or
the
usurpations
of
congress
he
denounced
with
terrible
earnestness
and
sometimes
with
great
eloquence
this
is
the
key
to
the
significant
portion
of
his
political
career
in
his
speech
on
the
force
bill
in
he
says
if
we
now
raise
our
eyes
and
direct
them
towards
that
once
beautiful
system
with
all
its
various
separate
and
independent
parts
blended
into
one
harmonious
whole
we
must
be
struck
with
the
mighty
change
all
have
disappeared
gone
absorbed
concentrated
and
consolidated
in
this
government
which
is
left
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
desolation
of
the
system
the
sole
and
unrestricted
representative
of
an
absolute
and
despotic
majority
in
the
place
of
their
admirably
contrived
system
the
act
proposed
to
be
repealed
has
erected
our
great
consolidated
government
can
it
be
necessary
for
me
to
show
what
must
be
the
inevitable
consequences
it
was
clearly
foreseen
and
foretold
on
the
formation
of
the
constitution
what
these
consequences
would
be
all
the
calamities
we
have
experienced
and
those
which
are
yet
to
come
are
the
result
of
the
consolidating
tendency
of
this
government
and
unless
this
tendency
be
arrested
all
that
has
been
foretold
will
certainly
befall
us
even
to
the
pouring
out
of
the
last
vial
of
wrath
military
despotism
that
was
what
calhoun
feared
that
the
consolidation
of
a
central
power
would
be
fatal
to
the
liberties
of
the
country
and
the
rights
of
the
states
and
would
introduce
a
system
of
spoils
and
the
reign
of
demagogues
all
in
subserviency
to
a
mere
military
chieftain
utterly
unfit
to
guide
the
nation
in
its
complicated
interests
but
his
gloomy
predictions
fortunately
were
not
fulfilled
in
spite
of
all
the
misrule
and
obstinacy
of
the
man
he
intensely
distrusted
and
disliked
the
tendency
has
been
to
usurpations
by
congress
rather
than
by
the
executive
it
is
impossible
not
to
admire
the
lofty
tone
free
from
personal
animus
which
is
seen
in
all
calhoun
speeches
they
may
have
been
sophistical
but
they
appealed
purely
to
the
intellect
of
those
whom
he
addressed
without
the
rhetoric
of
his
great
antagonists
his
speeches
are
compact
arguments
such
as
one
would
address
to
the
supreme
court
on
his
side
of
the
question
thus
far
his
speeches
in
the
senate
had
been
in
reference
to
economic
theories
and
legislation
antagonistic
to
the
interests
of
the
south
and
the
usurpations
of
executive
power
which
threatened
directly
the
rights
of
independent
states
and
indirectly
the
liberties
of
the
people
and
the
political
degradation
of
the
nation
but
now
new
issues
arose
from
the
agitation
of
the
slavery
question
and
his
fame
chiefly
rests
on
his
persistent
efforts
to
suppress
this
agitation
as
logically
leading
to
the
dissolution
of
the
union
and
the
destruction
of
the
institution
with
which
its
prosperity
was
supposed
to
be
identified
the
early
abolitionists
as
i
remember
them
were
as
a
body
of
very
little
social
or
political
influence
they
were
earnest
and
uncompromising
in
denouncing
slavery
as
a
great
moral
evil
indeed
as
a
sin
disgraceful
to
a
free
people
and
hostile
alike
to
morality
and
civilization
but
in
the
general
apathy
as
to
an
institution
with
which
the
constitution
did
not
meddle
and
the
general
government
could
not
interfere
except
in
districts
and
territories
under
its
exclusive
control
the
abolitionists
were
generally
regarded
as
fanatical
and
mischievous
they
had
but
few
friends
and
supporters
among
the
upper
classes
and
none
among
politicians
the
pulpit
the
bar
the
press
and
the
colleges
were
highly
conservative
and
did
not
like
the
popular
agitation
much
better
than
the
southerners
themselves
but
the
leaders
of
the
antislavery
movement
persevered
in
their
denunciations
of
slaveholders
and
of
all
who
sympathized
with
them
they
held
public
meetings
everywhere
and
gradually
became
fierce
and
irritating
it
was
the
period
of
lyceum
lectures
when
all
moral
subjects
were
discussed
before
the
people
with
fearlessness
and
often
with
acrimony
most
of
the
popular
lecturers
were
men
of
radical
sympathies
and
were
inclined
to
view
all
evils
on
abstract
principles
as
well
as
in
their
practical
effects
thus
the
advocates
of
peace
believed
that
war
under
all
circumstances
was
wicked
the
temperance
reformers
insisted
that
the
use
of
alcoholic
liquors
in
all
cases
was
a
sin
learned
professors
in
theological
schools
attempted
to
prove
that
the
wines
of
palestine
were
unfermented
and
could
not
intoxicate
the
radical
abolitionists
in
like
manner
asserted
that
it
was
wicked
to
hold
a
man
in
bondage
under
any
form
of
government
or
under
any
guarantee
of
the
constitution
at
first
they
were
contented
to
point
out
the
moral
evils
of
slavery
both
on
the
master
and
the
slave
but
this
did
not
provoke
much
opposition
since
the
evils
were
open
and
confessed
even
at
the
south
only
it
was
regarded
as
none
of
their
business
since
the
evils
could
not
be
remedied
and
had
always
been
lamented
that
slavery
was
simply
an
evil
and
generally
acknowledged
to
be
both
north
and
south
was
taking
rather
tame
ground
even
as
peace
doctrines
were
unexciting
when
it
was
allowed
that
if
we
must
fight
we
must
but
there
was
some
excitement
in
the
questions
whether
it
were
allowable
to
fight
at
all
or
drink
wine
at
any
time
or
hold
a
slave
under
any
circumstances
the
lecturers
must
take
stronger
grounds
if
they
wished
to
be
heard
or
to
excite
interest
so
they
next
unhesitatingly
assumed
the
ground
that
war
was
a
per
and
also
and
all
and
a
host
of
other
things
their
discussions
aroused
the
intellect
as
well
as
appealed
to
the
moral
sense
even
women
fearlessly
went
into
fierce
discussions
and
became
intolerant
gradually
the
whole
north
and
west
were
aroused
not
merely
to
the
moral
evils
of
slavery
which
were
admitted
without
discussion
but
to
the
intolerable
abomination
of
holding
a
slave
under
any
conditions
as
against
reason
against
conscience
and
against
humanity
the
southerners
themselves
felt
that
the
evil
was
a
great
one
and
made
some
attempt
to
remedy
it
by
colonization
societies
they
would
send
free
blacks
to
liberia
to
christianize
and
civilize
the
natives
sunk
in
the
lowest
abyss
of
misery
and
shame
many
were
the
christian
men
and
women
at
the
south
who
pitied
the
hard
condition
under
which
their
slaves
were
born
and
desired
to
do
all
they
could
to
ameliorate
it
but
when
the
abolitionists
announced
that
all
slaveholding
was
a
sin
and
when
public
opinion
at
the
north
was
evidently
drifting
to
this
doctrine
then
the
planters
grew
indignant
and
enraged
it
became
unpleasant
for
a
northern
merchant
or
traveller
to
visit
a
southern
city
and
equally
unpleasant
for
a
southern
student
to
enter
a
northern
college
or
a
planter
to
resort
to
a
northern
the
of
the
planter
was
outraged
when
told
that
he
was
a
sinner
above
all
others
he
was
exasperated
beyond
measure
when
incendiary
publications
were
transmitted
through
southern
mails
he
did
not
believe
that
he
was
necessarily
immoral
because
he
retained
an
institution
bequeathed
to
him
by
his
ancestors
and
recognized
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
calhoun
was
the
impersonation
of
southern
feelings
as
well
as
the
representative
of
southern
interests
he
intensely
felt
the
indignity
which
the
abolitionists
cast
upon
his
native
state
and
upon
its
peculiar
institution
and
he
was
enough
to
see
that
if
public
opinion
settled
down
into
the
conviction
that
slavery
was
a
sin
as
well
as
an
inherited
evil
the
north
and
south
could
not
long
live
together
in
harmony
and
peace
he
saw
that
any
institution
would
be
endangered
with
the
verdict
of
the
civilized
world
against
it
he
knew
that
public
opinion
was
an
amazing
power
which
might
be
defied
but
not
successfully
resisted
he
saw
no
way
to
stop
the
continually
increasing
attacks
of
the
antislavery
agitators
except
by
adopting
an
entirely
new
position
a
position
which
should
unite
all
the
slaveholding
states
in
the
strongest
ties
of
interest
accordingly
he
declared
as
the
leader
of
southern
opinions
and
interests
that
slavery
was
neither
an
evil
nor
a
sin
but
a
positive
good
and
blessing
supported
even
by
the
bible
as
well
as
by
the
constitution
in
assuming
these
premises
he
may
have
argued
logically
but
he
lost
the
admiration
he
had
gained
by
twenty
years
services
in
the
national
legislature
his
premises
were
wrong
and
his
arguments
would
necessarily
be
sophistical
and
fall
to
the
ground
he
stepped
down
from
the
lofty
pedestal
he
had
hitherto
occupied
to
become
not
merely
a
partisan
but
an
unscrupulous
politician
he
had
a
right
to
defend
his
beloved
institutions
as
the
leader
of
interests
intrusted
to
him
to
guard
his
fault
was
not
in
being
a
partisan
for
most
politicians
are
party
men
it
was
in
advancing
a
falsehood
as
the
basis
of
his
arguments
but
if
he
had
stultified
his
own
magnificent
intellect
he
could
not
impose
on
the
convictions
of
mankind
from
the
time
he
assumed
a
ground
utterly
untenable
whatever
were
his
motives
or
real
convictions
his
general
influence
waned
his
arguments
did
not
convince
since
they
were
deductions
from
wrong
premises
and
premises
which
shocked
and
insulted
the
reason
calhoun
now
became
a
man
of
one
idea
and
that
a
false
one
he
was
a
gigantic
crank
an
indifferent
to
means
so
long
as
he
could
bring
about
his
end
and
he
became
not
merely
a
casuist
but
a
dictatorial
and
arrogant
politician
he
defied
that
patriotic
burst
of
public
opinion
which
had
compelled
him
to
change
his
ground
that
mighty
wave
of
thought
no
more
to
be
resisted
than
a
storm
upon
the
ocean
and
which
he
saw
would
gradually
sweep
away
his
cherished
institution
unless
his
constituents
and
the
whole
south
should
be
made
to
feel
that
their
cause
was
right
and
just
that
slavery
had
not
only
materially
enriched
the
southern
states
but
had
converted
fetich
idolaters
to
the
true
worship
of
god
and
widened
the
domain
of
civilization
the
planters
one
and
all
responded
to
this
sophistical
and
seductive
plea
and
said
to
one
another
now
we
can
defy
the
universe
on
moral
grounds
we
stand
united
what
care
we
for
the
ravings
of
fanatics
outside
our
borders
so
long
as
our
institution
is
a
blessing
to
us
planted
on
the
rock
of
christianity
and
endorsed
by
the
best
men
among
us
the
theologians
took
up
the
cause
both
north
and
south
and
made
their
pulpits
ring
with
appeals
to
scripture
were
not
they
said
the
negroes
descendants
of
ham
and
had
not
these
descendants
been
cursed
by
the
almighty
and
given
over
to
the
control
of
the
children
of
shem
and
japhet
not
indeed
to
be
trodden
down
like
beasts
but
to
be
elevated
and
softened
by
them
and
made
useful
in
the
toils
which
white
men
could
not
endure
united
with
politicians
in
building
up
a
public
sentiment
in
favor
of
slavery
as
the
best
possible
condition
for
the
ignorant
sensuous
and
superstitious
races
who
when
put
under
the
training
and
guardianship
of
a
civilized
and
christian
people
had
escaped
the
harder
lot
which
their
fathers
endured
in
the
deserts
and
the
swamps
of
africa
the
agitation
at
the
north
had
been
gradually
but
constantly
increasing
in
william
lloyd
garrison
started
the
liberator
in
the
new
england
antislavery
society
was
founded
in
boston
in
new
york
had
a
corresponding
society
and
joshua
leavitt
established
the
emancipator
books
tracts
and
other
publications
began
to
be
circulated
by
lectures
newspapers
meetings
and
all
manner
of
means
the
propagandism
was
carried
on
on
the
other
hand
the
most
violent
opposition
had
been
manifested
throughout
the
north
to
these
fanatics
no
language
was
too
opprobrious
to
apply
to
them
the
churches
and
ministry
were
either
dumb
on
the
subject
or
defended
slavery
from
the
scriptures
mobs
broke
up
antislavery
meetings
and
in
some
cases
proceeded
even
to
the
extreme
of
attack
and
murder
as
in
the
case
of
lovejoy
of
illinois
the
approach
of
the
political
campaign
of
when
van
buren
was
running
as
the
successor
of
jackson
involved
the
democratic
party
as
the
ally
of
the
south
for
political
purposes
and
harmony
and
union
were
the
offsets
to
the
cry
for
emancipation
by
the
excitement
was
at
its
height
and
especially
along
the
line
of
the
moral
and
religious
argumentation
where
the
proslavery
men
met
talk
with
talk
what
could
the
abolitionists
do
now
with
their
northern
societies
to
show
that
slavery
was
a
wrong
and
a
sin
their
weapons
fell
harmless
on
the
bucklers
of
warriors
who
supposed
themselves
fighting
under
the
protection
of
almighty
power
in
order
to
elevate
and
christianize
a
doomed
race
victory
seemed
to
be
snatched
from
victors
and
in
the
moral
contest
the
southern
planters
and
their
northern
supporters
swelled
the
air
with
triumphant
shouts
they
were
impregnable
in
their
new
defences
since
they
claimed
to
be
in
the
right
both
parties
had
now
alike
appealed
to
reason
and
scripture
and
where
were
the
judges
who
could
settle
conflicting
opinions
the
abolitionists
somewhat
discouraged
but
undaunted
then
changed
their
mode
of
attack
they
said
we
will
waive
the
moral
question
for
we
talk
to
men
without
conscience
and
we
will
instead
make
it
a
political
one
we
will
appeal
to
majorities
we
will
attack
the
hostile
forces
in
a
citadel
which
they
can
not
hold
the
district
of
columbia
belongs
to
congress
congress
can
abolish
slavery
if
it
chooses
in
its
own
territory
having
possession
of
this
great
fortress
we
can
extend
our
political
warfare
to
the
vast
and
indefinite
west
and
at
least
prevent
the
further
extension
of
we
will
trust
to
time
and
circumstance
and
truth
to
do
the
rest
we
will
petition
congress
itself
and
from
onward
petitions
rolled
into
both
houses
from
all
parts
of
the
north
and
west
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
congress
could
constitutionally
do
the
venerable
and
enlightened
john
quincy
adams
headed
the
group
of
petitioners
in
the
house
of
representatives
there
were
now
two
thousand
antislavery
societies
in
the
united
states
in
three
hundred
thousand
persons
petitioned
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
the
legislatures
of
massachusetts
and
vermont
had
gone
so
far
as
to
censure
congress
for
its
inaction
and
indifference
to
the
rights
of
humanity
but
it
was
in
january
that
john
calhoun
arose
in
his
wrath
and
denied
the
right
of
petition
the
indignant
north
responded
to
such
an
assumption
in
flaming
words
what
said
the
leaders
of
public
opinion
can
not
the
lowest
subjects
of
the
czar
or
the
shah
appeal
to
ultimate
authority
has
there
ever
been
an
empire
so
despotic
as
to
deny
so
obvious
a
right
did
not
caesar
and
cyrus
louis
and
napoleon
receive
petitions
shall
an
enlightened
congress
reject
the
prayers
of
the
most
powerful
of
their
constituents
and
to
remove
an
evil
which
people
generally
regard
as
an
outrage
and
all
people
as
a
misfortune
we
will
not
allow
the
reception
of
petitions
at
all
said
the
southern
leaders
for
they
will
lead
to
discussion
on
a
forbidden
subject
they
are
only
an
entrance
wedge
to
disrupt
the
union
the
constitution
has
guaranteed
to
us
exclusively
the
preservation
of
an
institution
on
which
our
welfare
rests
you
usurp
a
privilege
which
you
call
a
right
your
demands
are
dangerous
to
the
peace
of
the
union
and
are
preposterous
you
violate
unwritten
law
you
seek
to
do
what
the
founders
of
our
republic
never
dreamed
of
when
two
of
the
states
ceded
their
own
slave
territory
to
the
central
government
it
was
with
the
understanding
that
slavery
should
remain
as
it
was
in
the
district
we
owned
and
controlled
you
can
not
lawfully
even
discuss
the
matter
it
is
none
of
your
concern
it
is
an
institution
which
was
the
basis
of
that
great
compromise
without
which
there
never
could
have
been
a
united
nation
only
a
league
of
sovereign
states
we
have
the
same
right
to
exclude
the
discussion
of
this
question
from
these
halls
as
from
the
capitals
of
our
respective
states
the
right
of
petition
on
such
a
subject
is
tantamount
to
consideration
and
discussion
which
would
be
unlawful
interference
with
our
greatest
institution
leading
legitimately
and
logically
to
disunion
and
war
is
it
right
is
it
generous
is
it
patriotic
to
drive
us
to
such
an
alternative
we
only
ask
to
be
let
alone
you
assail
a
sacred
ark
where
dwell
the
seraphim
and
cherubim
of
our
liberties
of
our
honor
of
our
interests
of
our
loyalty
itself
to
this
we
never
will
consent
clay
then
came
forward
in
congress
as
an
advocate
for
considering
the
question
of
petitions
he
was
for
free
argument
on
the
subject
he
admitted
that
the
abolitionists
were
dangerous
but
he
could
not
shut
his
eyes
to
an
indisputable
right
so
he
went
as
was
his
custom
pleasing
neither
party
and
alienating
friends
but
at
the
same
time
with
great
tact
laying
out
a
middle
ground
where
the
opposing
parties
could
still
stand
together
without
open
conflict
i
am
no
friend
said
he
to
slavery
the
searcher
of
hearts
knows
that
every
pulsation
of
mine
beats
high
and
strong
in
the
cause
of
civil
liberty
wherever
it
is
practicable
and
safe
i
desire
to
see
every
portion
of
the
human
family
in
the
enjoyment
of
it
but
i
prefer
the
liberty
of
my
own
country
to
that
of
other
people
the
liberty
of
the
descendants
of
africa
in
the
united
states
is
incompatible
with
the
liberty
and
safety
of
the
european
descendants
such
were
the
sentiments
of
the
leading
classes
of
the
north
not
yet
educated
up
to
the
doctrines
which
afterwards
prevailed
but
the
sentiments
declared
by
clay
lost
him
the
presidency
his
political
sins
like
those
of
webster
were
sins
of
omission
rather
than
of
commission
neither
of
them
saw
that
the
little
cloud
in
the
horizon
would
soon
cover
the
heavens
and
pour
down
a
deluge
to
sweep
away
abominations
worse
than
ahab
ever
dreamed
of
clay
did
not
go
far
enough
to
please
the
rising
party
he
did
not
see
the
power
or
sustain
the
rightful
exercise
of
this
new
moral
force
but
he
did
argue
on
grounds
of
political
expediency
for
the
citizens
right
of
petition
a
right
conceded
even
to
the
subjects
of
unlimited
despotism
an
ahasuerus
could
throw
petitions
into
the
mire
without
reading
but
it
was
customary
to
accept
them
the
result
was
a
decision
on
the
part
of
congress
to
admit
the
petitions
but
to
pay
no
further
attention
to
them
the
abolitionists
however
had
resorted
to
less
scrupulous
measures
they
sent
incendiary
matter
through
the
mails
not
with
the
object
of
inciting
the
slaves
to
rebellion
this
was
hopeless
but
with
the
design
of
aiding
their
escape
from
bondage
and
perchance
of
influencing
traitors
in
the
southern
camp
to
this
new
attack
calhoun
responded
with
dignity
and
with
logic
and
we
can
not
reasonably
blame
him
for
repelling
it
the
southern
cities
had
as
good
a
right
to
exclude
inflammatory
pamphlets
as
new
york
or
boston
has
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
the
cholera
it
was
the
instinct
of
whatever
may
be
said
of
their
favorite
institution
on
ethical
grounds
they
had
the
legal
right
to
protect
it
from
incendiary
matter
but
what
was
incendiary
matter
who
should
determine
that
point
president
jackson
in
had
recommended
congress
to
pass
a
law
prohibiting
under
severe
penalties
the
circulation
in
the
southern
states
through
the
mails
of
incendiary
publications
but
this
did
not
satisfy
the
southern
dictator
he
denied
the
right
of
congress
to
determine
what
publications
should
be
or
should
not
be
excluded
he
maintained
that
this
was
a
matter
for
the
states
alone
to
decide
he
would
not
trust
postmasters
for
they
were
officers
of
the
united
states
government
it
was
not
for
them
to
be
inquisitors
nor
for
the
federal
government
to
interfere
even
for
the
protection
of
a
state
institution
with
its
own
judgment
he
proposed
instead
a
law
forbidding
federal
postmasters
to
deliver
publications
prohibited
by
the
laws
of
a
state
territory
or
district
in
this
as
in
all
other
controverted
questions
calhoun
found
means
to
argue
for
the
supremacy
of
the
state
and
the
subordination
of
the
union
his
bill
did
not
pass
but
the
force
of
his
argument
went
forth
into
the
land
how
far
antislavery
documents
had
influence
on
the
slaves
themselves
it
is
difficult
to
say
they
could
neither
read
nor
write
but
it
is
remarkable
that
from
this
period
a
large
number
of
slaves
made
their
escape
from
the
south
and
fled
to
the
north
protected
by
philanthropists
abolitionists
and
generally
how
they
contrived
to
travel
a
thousand
miles
without
money
without
suitable
clothing
pursued
by
and
hiding
in
the
daytime
in
swamps
morasses
and
forests
walking
by
night
in
darkness
and
gloom
until
passed
by
friendly
hands
through
underground
railroads
until
they
reached
canada
is
a
mystery
but
these
efforts
to
escape
from
their
hard
and
cruel
masters
further
intensified
the
exasperation
of
the
south
it
was
in
that
michigan
and
arkansas
applied
for
admission
as
states
into
the
union
one
free
and
the
other
with
slavery
discussions
on
some
technicalities
concerning
the
conditions
of
michigan
admission
gave
calhoun
a
chance
for
more
argumentation
about
the
sovereignty
of
a
state
which
considering
the
fact
that
michigan
had
not
then
been
admitted
but
was
awaiting
the
permission
of
congress
a
state
showed
the
weakness
of
his
logic
in
the
falsity
of
his
premise
besides
arkansas
the
also
gained
access
to
a
strip
of
free
territory
north
of
the
compromise
line
of
and
the
missouri
river
in
john
quincy
adams
the
old
man
eloquent
of
the
house
of
representatives
narrowly
escaped
censure
for
introducing
a
petition
from
slaves
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
calhoun
introduced
resolutions
declaring
that
petitions
relative
to
slavery
in
the
district
were
a
direct
and
dangerous
attack
on
the
institutions
of
all
the
states
in
henry
clay
offered
a
petition
for
the
repression
of
all
agitation
respecting
slavery
in
the
district
calhoun
saw
and
constantly
denounced
the
danger
he
knew
the
power
of
public
opinion
and
saw
the
rising
tide
conservatism
heeded
the
warning
and
the
opposition
to
agitation
intensified
all
over
the
south
and
the
north
but
to
no
avail
new
societies
were
formed
new
papers
were
established
religious
bodies
began
to
take
position
for
and
against
the
agitation
the
maine
legislature
passed
in
the
lower
house
and
almost
in
the
upper
resolutions
denouncing
slavery
in
the
district
while
the
abolitionists
labored
incessantly
and
vigorously
to
blow
the
trumpet
cry
aloud
and
spare
not
show
my
people
their
sins
as
to
slavery
in
van
buren
and
harrison
the
democratic
and
whig
candidates
for
the
presidency
were
both
in
the
hands
of
the
and
tyler
who
as
succeeded
to
the
executive
chair
on
harrison
death
was
a
virginian
slaveholder
the
ruling
classes
and
politicians
all
over
the
land
were
violently
opposed
to
the
antislavery
cause
and
every
test
of
strength
gave
new
securities
and
pledges
to
the
southern
elements
and
their
northern
sympathizers
notwithstanding
the
frequent
triumphs
of
the
south
aided
by
whigs
and
democrats
from
the
north
who
played
into
the
hands
of
southern
politicians
calhoun
was
not
entirely
at
rest
in
his
mind
he
saw
with
alarm
the
increasing
immigration
into
the
western
states
which
threatened
to
disturb
the
balance
of
power
which
the
south
had
ever
held
and
with
the
aid
of
southern
leaders
he
now
devised
a
new
and
bold
scheme
which
was
to
annex
texas
to
the
united
states
and
thus
enlarge
enormously
the
area
of
slavery
it
was
probably
his
design
not
so
much
to
strengthen
the
slaveholding
interests
of
south
carolina
as
to
increase
the
political
power
of
the
south
by
the
addition
of
new
slave
states
he
could
hope
for
more
favorable
legislation
in
congress
the
the
haughty
and
defiant
dictator
would
not
only
exclude
congress
from
all
legislation
over
its
own
territory
in
the
national
district
but
he
now
would
make
congress
bolster
up
his
cause
he
could
calculate
on
a
solid
south
and
also
upon
the
aid
of
the
leaders
of
the
political
parties
at
the
north
northern
men
with
southern
principles
who
were
strangely
indifferent
to
the
extension
of
slavery
the
abolitionists
were
indeed
now
a
power
but
the
antislavery
sentiment
had
not
reached
its
culmination
although
it
had
become
politically
organized
for
the
campaign
of
seeing
the
futility
of
petition
and
the
folly
of
expecting
action
on
issues
foreign
to
those
on
which
congressmen
had
been
elected
the
abolitionists
boldly
called
a
national
convention
in
which
six
states
were
represented
and
nominated
candidates
for
the
presidency
and
it
was
a
small
and
despised
beginning
but
it
was
the
germ
of
a
mighty
growth
from
that
time
the
liberty
party
began
to
hold
state
and
national
conventions
and
to
vote
directly
on
the
question
of
representatives
they
did
not
for
years
elect
anybody
but
they
defeated
many
an
ultra
man
and
their
influence
began
to
be
felt
in
joshua
giddings
from
ohio
and
in
john
hale
from
new
hampshire
and
hannibal
hamlin
from
maine
brought
in
fresh
northern
air
and
confronted
the
in
congress
in
alliance
with
grand
old
john
quincy
adams
whose
last
years
were
his
best
years
and
have
illumined
his
name
most
of
the
antislavery
men
were
still
denounced
as
fanatics
meddling
with
what
was
none
of
their
business
in
they
had
not
enrolled
in
their
ranks
the
most
influential
men
in
the
community
ministers
professors
lawyers
and
merchants
generally
still
held
aloof
from
the
controversy
and
were
either
hostile
or
indifferent
to
it
so
with
the
aid
of
the
as
they
were
stigmatized
by
the
progressive
party
calhoun
was
confident
of
success
in
the
texan
scheme
at
that
time
many
adventurers
had
settled
in
texas
which
was
then
a
province
of
mexico
and
had
carried
with
them
their
slaves
in
moses
austin
a
connecticut
man
long
resident
in
missouri
obtained
large
grants
of
land
in
texas
from
the
mexican
government
and
his
son
stephen
carried
out
after
the
father
death
a
scheme
of
colonization
of
some
three
hundred
families
from
missouri
and
louisiana
they
were
a
rough
and
lawless
population
but
and
enterprising
they
increased
rapidly
until
in
being
twenty
thousand
in
number
they
tried
to
form
a
state
government
under
mexico
and
this
being
denied
them
declared
their
independence
and
made
revolution
they
were
headed
by
sam
houston
who
had
fought
under
general
jackson
and
had
been
governor
of
tennessee
in
the
independence
of
texas
was
proclaimed
soon
after
followed
the
battle
of
san
jacinto
in
which
santa
anna
the
president
of
the
mexican
republic
and
the
commander
of
the
mexican
forces
was
taken
prisoner
immediately
after
this
battle
calhoun
tried
to
have
it
announced
as
the
policy
of
the
government
to
recognize
the
independence
of
texas
when
tyler
became
president
by
the
death
of
harrison
although
elected
by
whig
votes
he
entered
heart
and
soul
into
the
schemes
of
calhoun
who
to
forward
them
left
the
senate
and
became
secretary
of
state
as
successor
to
upshur
in
it
became
apparent
that
texas
would
be
annexed
to
the
united
states
in
that
same
year
iowa
and
florida
one
free
the
other
slave
were
admitted
to
the
union
the
liberty
party
beheld
the
proposed
annexation
of
texas
with
alarm
and
sturdily
opposed
it
as
far
as
they
could
through
their
friends
in
congress
predicting
that
it
would
be
tantamount
to
a
war
with
mexico
the
mexican
minister
declared
the
same
result
but
texas
or
disunion
became
the
rallying
cry
of
the
south
the
election
of
polk
the
annexationist
democrat
in
was
seized
upon
as
a
popular
mandate
for
annexation
although
had
not
the
liberty
party
who
like
the
whigs
were
divided
the
vote
in
new
york
state
clay
would
have
been
elected
the
matter
was
hurried
through
congress
the
northern
democrats
made
no
serious
opposition
since
they
saw
in
this
annexation
a
vast
accession
of
territory
around
the
gulf
of
mexico
of
indefinite
extent
thus
texas
on
march
was
offered
annexation
by
a
joint
resolution
of
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
in
the
face
of
protests
from
the
wisest
men
of
the
country
and
in
spite
of
certain
hostilities
with
mexico
on
the
following
fourth
of
july
texas
accepting
annexation
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
a
slave
state
to
the
dismay
of
channing
of
garrison
of
phillips
of
sumner
of
adams
and
of
the
whole
antislavery
party
now
aroused
to
the
necessity
of
more
united
effort
in
view
of
this
great
victory
to
the
south
for
it
was
provided
that
at
any
time
by
the
consent
of
its
own
citizens
texas
might
be
divided
into
four
states
whenever
its
population
should
be
large
enough
its
territory
was
four
times
as
large
as
france
the
democratic
president
polk
took
office
in
march
the
mexican
war
beginning
in
may
was
fought
to
a
successful
close
in
a
year
and
five
months
ending
september
the
fertile
territory
of
oregon
purchased
from
spain
had
been
peaceably
occupied
by
rapid
immigration
and
by
settlement
of
disputed
boundaries
with
great
britain
california
a
mexican
province
had
been
secured
to
the
american
settlers
of
its
lovely
hills
and
valleys
by
the
prompt
daring
of
capt
john
frémont
and
the
result
of
the
war
was
the
formal
cession
to
the
united
states
by
mexico
of
the
territories
of
california
and
new
mexico
and
recognition
of
the
annexation
and
statehood
of
texas
both
the
north
and
the
south
had
thus
gained
large
possibilities
and
at
the
north
the
spirit
of
enterprise
and
the
clear
perception
of
the
economic
value
of
free
labor
as
against
slave
labor
were
working
mightily
to
help
men
see
the
moral
arguments
of
the
antislavery
people
the
division
of
interest
was
becoming
plain
the
forces
of
good
sense
and
the
principles
of
liberty
were
consolidating
the
north
against
farther
extension
of
the
the
perils
foreseen
by
calhoun
which
he
had
striven
to
avoid
by
repression
of
all
political
discussion
of
slavery
were
nigh
at
hand
the
politicians
of
the
north
too
scented
the
change
and
began
to
range
themselves
with
their
section
and
while
there
was
a
long
struggle
yet
ahead
before
the
issues
would
be
made
up
to
the
eye
of
faith
the
end
was
already
in
sight
and
the
now
redoubled
their
efforts
both
in
discussion
and
in
political
action
thus
far
most
of
the
political
victories
had
been
with
the
and
the
south
became
correspondently
arrogant
and
defiant
the
war
of
ideas
against
southern
interests
now
raged
with
ominous
and
increasing
force
in
all
the
northern
states
public
opinion
became
more
and
more
inflamed
passions
became
excited
in
cities
and
towns
and
villages
which
had
been
dormant
since
the
constitution
had
been
adopted
the
decree
of
the
north
went
forth
that
there
should
be
no
more
accession
of
slave
territory
and
more
than
this
the
population
spread
with
unexampled
rapidity
toward
the
pacific
ocean
in
consequence
of
the
discovery
of
gold
in
california
in
and
attracted
by
the
fertile
soil
of
oregon
immigrants
from
all
nations
came
to
seek
their
fortunes
in
territories
north
of
what
calhoun
had
anticipated
in
when
he
cast
his
eyes
on
texas
did
not
take
place
slave
territory
indeed
was
increased
but
free
territory
increased
still
more
rapidly
the
north
was
becoming
richer
and
richer
and
the
south
scarcely
held
its
own
the
balance
which
he
thought
would
be
in
favor
of
the
south
he
now
saw
inclining
to
the
north
northern
states
became
more
numerous
than
southern
ones
and
more
populous
more
wealthy
and
more
intelligent
the
political
power
of
the
union
when
polk
closed
his
inglorious
administration
was
perceptibly
with
the
north
and
not
political
power
only
but
moral
power
the
great
west
was
the
soil
of
freemen
but
the
haughty
and
defiant
spirit
of
calhoun
was
not
broken
he
prophesied
woes
he
became
sad
and
dejected
but
more
and
more
uncompromising
more
and
more
dictatorial
he
would
not
yield
if
we
yield
an
inch
said
he
we
are
lost
the
slightest
concession
in
his
eyes
would
be
fatal
when
he
declared
his
nullification
doctrines
it
was
because
he
thought
that
state
rights
were
invaded
by
hostile
tariffs
but
after
the
mexican
war
slavery
was
to
him
a
matter
of
life
and
death
he
made
many
excellent
and
powerful
speeches
which
tasked
the
intellect
of
webster
to
refute
but
whatever
the
subject
it
was
seen
only
through
his
southern
spectacles
and
argued
from
partisan
grounds
and
with
partisan
zeal
everything
he
uttered
was
with
a
view
of
consolidating
the
south
and
preparing
it
for
disunion
and
secession
as
the
only
way
to
preserve
the
beloved
institution
in
his
eyes
slavery
and
the
union
could
not
this
he
saw
plainly
but
if
either
must
perish
it
should
be
the
union
and
this
doctrine
he
so
constantly
reiterated
that
he
won
over
to
it
nearly
the
entire
south
but
in
consolidating
the
south
he
also
consolidated
the
north
he
forced
on
the
issue
believing
that
even
yet
the
south
united
with
northern
allies
was
the
stronger
and
that
it
could
establish
its
independence
on
a
slavery
basis
the
union
was
no
union
at
all
and
its
constitution
was
a
worthless
parchment
he
proposed
a
convention
of
the
southern
states
which
should
agree
that
until
full
justice
was
rendered
to
the
south
all
the
southern
ports
should
be
closed
to
the
vessels
of
the
north
he
arrogantly
would
deprive
the
north
even
of
its
constitutional
rights
in
reference
to
the
exclusion
of
slavery
from
the
territories
in
no
way
should
the
north
meddle
with
the
slavery
question
on
penalty
of
secession
and
the
sooner
this
was
understood
the
better
we
are
said
he
relatively
stronger
than
we
shall
be
hereafter
politically
and
morally
the
great
fight
arose
in
the
people
in
the
northwestern
territories
had
been
encouraged
to
form
governments
and
had
already
tasted
the
delights
of
president
polk
had
recommended
the
extension
of
the
old
missouri
compromise
line
of
westward
to
the
pacific
leaving
the
territory
south
of
that
open
to
slavery
this
would
divide
california
and
was
opposed
by
all
parties
calhoun
now
went
so
far
as
to
claim
the
constitutional
right
to
take
slaves
into
any
territory
while
webster
argued
the
power
of
congress
to
rule
the
territories
until
they
should
become
states
so
excited
was
the
discussion
that
a
convention
of
southern
states
was
held
to
frame
a
separate
government
for
the
united
states
south
the
threat
of
secession
was
ever
their
most
potent
argument
the
contest
in
congress
centred
upon
the
admission
of
california
as
a
state
and
the
condition
of
slavery
in
the
territories
of
utah
and
new
mexico
a
great
crisis
had
now
arrived
clay
the
great
pacificator
once
more
stepped
into
the
arena
with
a
new
compromise
to
provide
for
concessions
on
either
side
he
proposed
the
admission
of
california
whose
new
constitution
prohibited
slavery
the
organization
of
utah
and
new
mexico
as
territories
without
mention
of
slavery
leaving
it
to
the
people
the
arrangement
of
the
boundary
of
texas
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
enactment
of
a
more
stringent
law
commanding
the
assistance
of
people
in
the
free
states
to
capture
runaways
when
summoned
by
the
authorities
the
general
excitement
over
the
discussion
of
this
bill
will
never
be
forgotten
by
those
who
witnessed
it
the
south
raged
and
the
north
blazed
with
indignation
especially
over
the
bill
meanwhile
calhoun
was
dying
his
figure
was
bent
his
voice
was
feeble
his
face
was
haggard
but
his
superb
intellect
still
retained
its
vigor
to
the
last
among
the
multitude
of
ringing
appeals
to
the
reason
and
moral
sense
of
the
north
was
a
newspaper
article
from
of
new
york
by
a
young
congregational
minister
henry
ward
beecher
it
was
entitled
shall
we
compromise
and
made
clear
and
plain
the
issue
before
the
people
slavery
is
right
slavery
is
wrong
slavery
shall
live
slavery
shall
die
are
these
conflicts
to
be
settled
by
any
mode
of
parcelling
out
certain
territories
this
article
was
read
to
calhoun
upon
his
dying
bed
who
wrote
that
he
asked
the
name
was
given
him
that
man
understands
the
thing
he
has
gone
to
the
bottom
of
it
he
will
be
heard
from
again
it
was
what
the
great
southerner
had
foreseen
and
foretold
from
the
first
the
compromise
bill
at
last
became
a
law
it
averted
the
final
outbreak
for
ten
years
longer
but
contained
elements
that
were
to
be
potent
factors
in
insuring
the
final
crisis
with
the
burden
of
the
whole
south
upon
his
shoulders
calhoun
tottered
to
the
grave
a
most
unhappy
man
for
though
he
saw
the
irrepressible
conflict
as
clearly
as
seward
had
done
he
also
saw
that
the
south
even
if
successful
as
he
hoped
must
go
through
a
sea
of
tribulation
when
he
was
no
longer
able
to
address
the
senate
in
person
he
still
waged
the
battle
his
last
great
speech
was
read
to
the
senate
by
mason
of
virginia
on
the
of
march
it
was
not
bitter
nor
acrimonious
it
was
a
doleful
lament
that
the
southern
states
could
not
long
remain
in
the
union
with
any
dignity
now
that
the
equilibrium
was
destroyed
he
felt
that
he
had
failed
but
also
that
he
had
done
his
duty
and
this
was
his
only
consolation
in
view
of
approaching
disasters
on
the
last
day
of
march
he
died
leaving
behind
him
his
principles
so
full
of
danger
and
sophistries
but
at
the
same
time
an
unsullied
name
and
the
memory
of
earlier
public
services
and
of
private
virtues
which
had
secured
to
him
the
respect
of
all
who
knew
him
in
reviewing
the
career
of
calhoun
it
would
seem
that
the
great
error
and
mistake
of
his
life
was
his
disloyalty
to
the
union
when
he
advocated
state
rights
as
paramount
over
those
of
the
general
government
he
merely
took
the
ground
which
was
discussed
over
and
over
again
at
the
formation
of
the
constitution
and
which
resulted
in
a
compromise
that
with
control
over
matters
of
interest
common
to
all
states
the
central
government
should
have
no
power
over
the
institution
of
slavery
which
was
a
domestic
affair
in
the
southern
states
only
these
states
it
was
settled
had
supreme
control
over
their
own
peculiar
institution
as
a
politician
representing
southern
interests
he
can
not
be
severely
condemned
for
his
fear
and
anger
over
the
discussion
of
the
slavery
question
which
politically
considered
was
out
of
the
range
of
congressional
legislation
or
popular
agitation
but
when
he
advocated
or
threatened
the
secession
of
the
southern
states
from
the
union
unless
the
slavery
question
was
let
alone
entirely
both
by
congress
and
the
northern
states
he
was
unpatriotic
false
in
his
allegiance
and
unconstitutional
in
his
utterances
a
state
has
a
right
to
enter
the
union
or
not
remaining
of
course
in
either
case
united
states
territory
over
which
congress
has
legislative
power
but
when
once
it
has
entered
into
the
union
it
must
remain
there
as
a
part
of
the
whole
otherwise
the
states
would
be
a
mere
league
as
in
the
revolutionary
times
calhoun
had
a
right
to
bring
the
whole
pressure
of
the
slave
states
on
a
congressional
vote
on
any
question
he
could
say
as
the
irish
members
of
parliament
say
unless
you
do
this
or
that
we
will
obstruct
the
wheels
of
government
and
thus
compel
the
consideration
of
our
grievances
so
long
as
we
hold
the
balance
of
power
between
contending
parties
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
for
the
irish
legislators
to
say
unless
you
do
this
or
that
we
will
secede
from
the
union
which
ireland
could
not
do
without
war
and
revolution
calhoun
in
his
onesidedness
entirely
overlooked
the
fact
that
the
discontented
states
could
not
secede
without
a
terrible
war
for
if
there
is
one
sentiment
dear
to
the
american
people
it
is
the
preservation
of
the
union
and
for
it
they
will
make
any
sacrifice
and
the
same
may
be
said
in
reference
to
calhoun
nullification
doctrines
he
would
if
he
could
have
taken
his
state
out
of
the
union
because
he
and
the
south
did
not
like
the
tariff
he
had
the
right
as
a
senator
in
congress
to
bring
all
the
influence
he
could
command
to
compel
congress
to
modify
the
tariff
or
abolish
it
altogether
and
with
this
he
ought
to
have
been
contented
with
a
solid
south
and
a
divided
north
he
could
have
compelled
a
favorable
compromise
or
prevented
any
legislation
at
all
it
is
legitimate
legislation
for
members
of
congress
to
maintain
their
local
and
sectional
interest
at
any
cost
short
of
disunion
only
it
may
be
neither
wise
nor
patriotic
since
men
who
are
supposed
to
be
statesmen
would
by
so
doing
acknowledge
themselves
to
be
mere
politicians
bound
hand
and
foot
in
subjection
to
selfish
constituents
and
indifferent
to
the
general
good
calhoun
became
blind
to
general
interests
in
his
zeal
to
perpetuate
slavery
or
advance
whatever
would
be
desirable
to
the
south
indifferent
to
the
rest
of
the
country
and
thus
he
was
a
mere
partisan
narrow
and
local
what
made
him
so
powerful
and
popular
at
the
south
equally
made
him
to
be
feared
and
distrusted
at
the
north
he
was
a
firebrand
infinitely
more
dangerous
and
incendiary
than
any
abolitionist
whom
he
denounced
calhoun
congressional
career
was
the
opposite
of
that
of
henry
clay
who
was
more
patriotic
and
more
of
a
statesman
for
he
always
professed
allegiance
to
the
whole
union
and
did
all
he
could
to
maintain
it
his
whole
soul
was
devoted
to
tariffs
and
internal
improvements
but
he
would
yield
important
points
to
produce
harmony
and
ward
off
dangers
calhoun
with
his
doctrines
his
partisanship
and
his
unscrupulous
defiance
of
the
constitution
forfeited
his
place
among
great
statesmen
and
lost
the
esteem
and
confidence
of
a
majority
of
his
countrymen
except
so
far
as
his
abilities
and
his
unsullied
private
life
entitled
him
to
admiration
authorities
i
know
of
no
abler
and
more
candid
life
of
calhoun
than
that
of
von
holst
although
deficient
in
incidents
it
is
no
small
contribution
to
american
literature
apparently
drawn
from
a
careful
study
of
the
speeches
of
the
great
nullifier
if
the
author
had
had
more
material
to
work
upon
he
would
probably
have
made

where
he
had
cleared
with
the
assistance

about
fifteen

gained

accordance
with
the
natural
curiosity
to
know
the
beginnings
of
illustrious
men
and
the
more
humble
the
more
interesting
these
are
to
most
people
it
is
quite
enough
to
say
that
no
man
in
the
united
states
ever
reached
eminence
from
a
more
obscure
origin
did
not
achieve
the
results
to
which
the
ambition
of
young
lincoln
aspired
so
he
contrived
to
go
into
the
grocery
business
but
in
this
he
was
unsuccessful
owing
to
an
inherent
deficiency
in
business
habits
and
aptitude
he
was
however
gifted
with
shrewd
sense
a
quick
sense
of
humor
with
keen
wit
and
a
marked
steadiness
of
character
which
gained
him
both
friends
and
popularity
in
the
miserable
little
community
where
he
lived
and
in
he
was
elected
captain
of
a
military
company
to
fight
indians
in
the
black
hawk
war
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
ever
saw
the
enemy
he
probably
would
have
fought
well
had
he
been
so
fortunate
as
to
encounter
the
foe
for
he
was
cool
fearless
strong
agile
and
active
without
rashness
in
he
was
made
postmaster
of
a
small
village
but
the
office
paid
nothing
and
his
principal
profit
from
it
was
the
opportunity
to
read
newspapers
and
some
magazine
trash
he
was
still
very
poor
and
was
surrounded
with
rough
people
who
lived
chiefly
on
corn
bread
and
salt
pork
who
slept
in
cabins
without
windows
and
who
drank
whiskey
to
excess
yet
who
were
more
intelligent
than
they
seemed
such
was
abraham
lincoln
at
the
age
of
obscure
unknown
and
without
a
calling
suppose
at
that
time
some
supernatural
being
had
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
and
announced
that
he
would
some
day
be
president
of
the
united
states
and
not
merely
this
but
that
he
would
rule
the
nation
in
a
great
crisis
and
save
it
from
dismemberment
and
anarchy
by
force
of
wisdom
and
character
and
leave
behind
him
when
he
died
a
fame
second
only
to
that
of
washington
would
he
not
have
felt
on
awaking
from
his
dream
pretty
much
as
did
the
aged
patriarch
whose
name
he
bore
when
the
angel
of
the
lord
assured
him
that
he
would
be
the
father
of
many
nations
that
his
seed
would
outnumber
the
sands
of
the
sea
and
that
through
him
all
humanity
would
be
blessed
from
generation
to
generation
would
he
not
have
felt
as
the
stripling
david
among
the
sheep
and
the
goats
of
his
father
flocks
when
the
prophet
samuel
announced
to
him
that
he
should
be
king
over
israel
and
rule
with
such
success
and
splendor
that
the
greatness
and
prosperity
of
the
jewish
nation
would
be
forever
dated
from
his
matchless
reign
the
obscure
postmaster
without
a
dollar
in
his
pocket
and
carrying
the
mail
in
his
hat
had
indeed
no
intimation
of
his
future
elevation
but
his
career
was
just
as
mysterious
as
that
of
david
and
an
religious
man
would
say
that
it
was
equally
providential
for
of
all
the
leading
men
of
this
great
nation
it
would
seem
that
he
turned
out
to
be
the
fittest
for
the
work
assigned
to
him
chosen
not
because
he
was
learned
or
cultivated
or
experienced
or
famous
or
even
interesting
but
because
his
steps
were
so
ordered
that
he
fell
into
the
paths
which
naturally
led
to
his
great
position
although
no
genius
could
have
foreseen
the
events
which
logically
controlled
the
result
if
lincoln
had
not
been
gifted
with
innate
greatness
though
unknown
to
himself
and
all
the
world
to
be
developed
as
occasions
should
arise
no
fortunate
circumstances
could
have
produced
so
extraordinary
a
career
if
lincoln
had
not
the
germs
of
greatness
in
him
certain
qualities
which
were
necessary
for
the
guidance
of
a
nation
in
an
emergency
to
be
developed
subsequently
as
the
need
came
then
his
career
is
utterly
insoluble
according
to
any
known
laws
of
human
success
and
when
history
can
not
solve
the
mysteries
of
human
success
in
other
words
justify
the
ways
of
providence
to
man
then
it
loses
half
its
charm
and
more
than
half
its
moral
force
it
ceases
to
be
the
great
teacher
which
all
nations
claim
it
to
be
however
obscure
the
birth
of
lincoln
and
untoward
as
were
all
the
circumstances
which
environed
him
he
was
doubtless
born
ambitious
that
is
with
a
strong
and
unceasing
desire
to
better
his
condition
that
at
the
age
of
he
ever
dreamed
of
reaching
an
exalted
position
is
improbable
but
when
he
saw
the
ascendency
that
his
wit
and
character
had
gained
for
him
among
rude
and
uncultivated
settlers
on
the
borders
of
civilization
then
being
a
born
leader
of
men
as
jackson
was
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
he
should
aspire
to
be
a
politician
politics
ever
have
been
the
passion
of
western
men
with
more
than
average
ability
and
it
required
but
little
learning
and
culture
under
the
sovereignty
of
squatters
to
become
a
member
of
the
state
legislature
especially
in
the
border
states
where
population
was
sparse
and
the
people
mostly
poor
and
ignorant
hence
smart
young
men
in
rude
villages
early
learned
to
make
speeches
in
social
and
political
meetings
every
village
had
its
favorite
stump
orator
who
knew
all
the
affairs
of
the
nation
and
a
little
more
and
who
with
windy
declamation
amused
and
delighted
his
rustic
hearers
lincoln
was
one
of
these
there
was
never
a
time
even
in
his
early
career
when
he
could
not
make
a
speech
in
which
there
was
more
wit
than
knowledge
although
as
he
increased
in
knowledge
he
also
grew
in
wisdom
and
his
good
sense
with
his
habit
of
patient
thinking
gave
him
the
power
of
clear
and
convincing
statement
moreover
at
he
was
already
tolerably
intelligent
and
had
devoured
all
the
books
he
could
lay
his
hand
upon
indeed
it
was
to
the
reading
of
books
that
lincoln
like
henry
clay
owed
pretty
much
all
his
schooling
beginning
with
weems
life
of
washington
when
a
mere
lad
he
perseveringly
read
through
all
his
fortunes
all
manner
of
books
not
only
during
leisure
hours
by
day
when
tending
mill
or
store
but
for
long
months
by
the
light
of
pine
shavings
from
the
cooper
shop
at
night
and
in
later
times
when
traversing
the
country
in
his
various
callings
and
his
persistent
reading
gave
him
new
ideas
and
broader
views
with
his
growing
thoughts
his
aspirations
grew
so
like
others
he
took
the
stump
and
as
early
as
offered
himself
a
candidate
for
the
state
legislature
his
maiden
speech
in
an
obscure
village
is
thus
reported
fellow
citizens
i
am
humble
abraham
lincoln
my
politics
are
short
and
sweet
like
the
old
woman
dance
i
am
in
favor
of
a
national
bank
of
internal
improvements
and
a
high
protective
tariff
these
are
my
sentiments
if
elected
i
shall
be
thankful
if
not
it
will
be
all
the
same
lincoln
was
not
elected
although
supported
by
the
citizens
of
new
salem
where
he
lived
and
to
whom
he
had
promised
the
improvement
of
the
sangamon
river
disappointed
he
went
into
the
grocery
business
once
again
and
again
failed
partly
because
he
had
no
capital
and
partly
because
he
had
no
business
talents
in
that
line
although
from
his
known
integrity
he
was
able
to
raise
what
money
he
needed
he
then
set
about
the
study
of
the
law
as
a
step
to
political
success
read
books
and
the
occasional
newspapers
told
stories
and
kept
his
soul
in
patience
which
was
easier
to
him
than
to
keep
his
body
in
decent
clothes
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
do
something
for
a
living
while
he
studied
law
since
the
grocery
business
had
failed
and
hence
he
became
an
assistant
to
john
calhoun
the
county
surveyor
who
was
overburdened
with
work
just
as
he
had
patiently
worked
through
an
english
grammar
to
enable
him
to
speak
correctly
he
took
up
a
work
on
surveying
and
prepared
himself
for
his
new
employment
in
six
weeks
he
was
soon
enabled
to
live
more
decently
and
to
make
valuable
acquaintances
meanwhile
diligently
pursuing
his
law
studies
not
only
during
his
leisure
but
even
as
he
travelled
about
the
country
to
and
from
his
work
on
foot
or
on
horseback
his
companion
was
sure
to
be
a
in
a
new
election
of
representatives
for
the
state
legislature
took
place
and
lincoln
became
a
candidate
this
time
with
more
success
owing
to
the
assistance
of
influential
friends
he
went
to
vandalia
the
state
capital
as
a
whig
and
a
great
admirer
of
henry
clay
he
was
placed
on
the
committee
of
public
accounts
and
expenditures
but
made
no
mark
yet
that
he
gained
respect
was
obvious
from
the
fact
that
he
was
by
a
very
large
vote
he
served
a
second
term
and
made
himself
popular
by
advocating
schemes
to
gridiron
every
county
with
railroads
straighten
out
the
courses
of
rivers
dig
canals
and
cut
up
the
state
into
towns
cities
and
one
might
suppose
that
a
man
so
cool
and
sensible
as
he
afterwards
proved
himself
to
be
must
have
seen
the
absurdity
of
these
wild
schemes
and
hence
only
fell
in
with
them
from
policy
as
a
rising
member
of
the
legislature
to
gain
favor
with
his
constituents
yet
he
and
his
colleagues
were
all
crude
and
inexperienced
legislators
and
it
is
no
discredit
to
lincoln
that
he
was
borne
along
with
the
rest
in
an
enthusiasm
for
developing
the
country
the
mania
for
speculation
was
nearly
universal
especially
in
the
new
western
states
illinois
alone
projected
miles
of
railroad
without
money
and
without
credit
to
carry
out
this
bedlam
legislation
and
in
almost
every
village
there
were
corner
lots
enough
to
be
sold
to
make
a
great
city
aside
from
this
participation
in
a
bubble
destined
to
burst
and
to
be
followed
by
disasters
bankruptcies
and
universal
distress
lincoln
was
credited
with
steadiness
and
gained
great
influence
he
was
prominent
in
securing
the
passage
of
a
bill
which
removed
the
seat
of
government
to
springfield
and
was
regarded
as
a
good
debater
in
this
session
too
he
and
daniel
stone
the
two
representatives
from
sangamon
county
introduced
a
resolution
declaring
that
the
institution
of
slavery
was
founded
on
both
injustice
and
bad
policy
that
the
congress
had
no
power
to
interfere
with
slavery
in
the
states
that
it
had
power
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
should
not
exercise
it
unless
at
the
request
of
the
people
of
the
district
there
were
no
votes
for
these
resolutions
but
it
is
interesting
to
see
how
early
lincoln
took
both
moral
and
constitutional
ground
concerning
national
action
on
this
vexed
question
in
march
lincoln
then
years
old
was
admitted
to
the
bar
and
made
choice
of
springfield
the
new
capital
as
a
residence
then
a
thriving
village
of
one
or
two
thousand
inhabitants
with
some
pretension
to
culture
and
refinement
it
was
certainly
a
political
if
not
a
social
centre
the
following
year
he
was
again
elected
to
the
legislature
and
came
within
a
few
votes
of
being
made
speaker
of
the
house
he
carried
on
the
practice
of
the
law
with
his
duties
as
a
legislator
indeed
law
and
politics
went
hand
in
hand
as
a
lawyer
he
gained
influence
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
as
a
member
of
the
legislature
he
increased
his
practice
in
the
courts
he
had
for
a
partner
a
major
stuart
who
in
left
him
having
been
elected
representative
in
congress
and
was
succeeded
in
the
firm
by
stephen
logan
lincoln
law
practice
was
far
from
lucrative
and
he
was
compelled
to
live
in
the
strictest
economy
litigation
was
very
simple
and
it
required
but
little
legal
learning
to
conduct
cases
the
lawyers
fees
were
small
among
a
people
who
were
mostly
poor
considering
however
his
defective
education
and
other
disadvantages
lincoln
success
as
a
lawyer
was
certainly
respectable
if
not
great
in
his
small
sphere
in
three
years
after
his
admission
to
the
bar
lincoln
was
chosen
as
an
elector
in
the
harrison
presidential
contest
and
he
stumped
the
state
frequently
encountering
stephen
douglas
in
debate
with
great
credit
to
himself
for
douglas
was
the
most
prominent
political
orator
of
the
day
the
heart
of
lincoln
from
the
start
was
in
politics
rather
than
the
law
for
which
he
had
no
especial
liking
he
was
born
to
make
speeches
in
political
gatherings
and
not
to
argue
complicated
legal
questions
in
the
courts
all
his
aspirations
were
political
as
early
as
he
aspired
to
be
a
member
of
congress
but
was
defeated
by
colonel
baker
in
however
his
political
ambition
was
gratified
by
an
election
to
the
house
of
representatives
his
record
in
congress
was
a
fair
one
but
he
was
not
distinguished
although
great
questions
were
being
discussed
in
connection
with
the
mexican
war
he
made
but
three
speeches
during
his
term
in
the
last
of
which
he
ridiculed
general
cass
aspiration
for
the
presidency
with
considerable
humor
and
wit
which
was
not
lost
on
his
constituents
his
career
in
congress
terminated
in
he
not
being
in
the
meantime
lincoln
married
in
miss
mary
todd
from
lexington
kentucky
a
lady
of
good
education
and
higher
social
position
than
his
own
whom
he
had
known
for
two
or
three
years
as
everybody
knows
this
marriage
did
not
prove
a
happy
one
and
domestic
troubles
account
in
a
measure
for
lincoln
sad
and
melancholy
countenance
biographers
have
devoted
more
space
than
is
wise
to
this
marriage
since
the
sorrows
of
a
great
man
claim
but
small
attention
compared
with
his
public
services
had
lincoln
not
been
an
honorable
man
it
is
probable
that
the
marriage
would
never
have
taken
place
in
view
of
incompatibilities
of
temper
which
no
one
saw
more
clearly
than
he
himself
and
which
disenchanted
him
the
engagement
was
broken
and
renewed
for
as
the
matter
stood
the
lady
being
determined
and
the
lover
uncertain
the
only
course
consistent
with
lincoln
honor
was
to
take
the
risk
of
marriage
and
devote
himself
with
renewed
ardor
to
his
profession
to
bury
his
domestic
troubles
in
work
and
persistently
avoid
all
quarrels
and
this
is
all
the
world
need
know
of
this
sad
affair
which
though
a
matter
of
gossip
never
was
a
scandal
it
is
unfortunate
for
the
fame
of
many
great
men
that
we
know
too
much
of
their
private
lives
froude
in
his
desire
for
historical
impartiality
did
no
good
to
the
memory
of
his
friend
carlyle
had
the
hero
peculiarities
been
vices
like
those
of
byron
the
biographer
might
have
cited
them
as
warnings
to
abate
the
ardor
of
popular
idolatry
of
genius
if
we
knew
no
more
of
the
private
failings
of
webster
than
we
do
of
those
of
calhoun
or
jefferson
davis
he
might
never
have
been
dethroned
from
the
lofty
position
he
occupied
which
as
a
public
benefactor
he
did
not
deserve
to
lose
after
his
marriage
lincoln
was
more
devoted
to
his
profession
and
gradually
became
a
good
lawyer
but
i
doubt
if
he
was
ever
a
great
one
like
his
friend
judge
davis
his
law
partner
and
biographer
william
herndon
who
became
associated
with
him
in
is
not
particularly
eulogistic
as
to
his
legal
abilities
although
he
concedes
that
he
had
many
of
the
qualities
of
a
great
lawyer
such
as
the
ability
to
see
important
points
lucidity
of
statement
and
extraordinary
logical
power
he
did
not
like
to
undertake
the
management
of
a
case
which
had
not
justice
and
right
on
its
side
he
had
no
method
in
his
business
and
detested
mechanical
drudgery
he
rarely
studied
unless
in
reference
to
a
case
in
which
he
was
employed
he
was
not
learned
in
the
decisions
of
the
higher
courts
he
was
a
poor
defender
of
a
wrong
cause
but
was
unappalled
by
the
difficulties
of
an
intricate
case
was
patient
and
painstaking
and
not
imposed
upon
by
sophistries
lincoln
love
of
truth
for
truth
sake
even
in
such
a
technical
matter
as
the
law
was
remarkable
no
important
error
ever
went
undetected
by
him
his
intellectual
vision
was
clear
since
he
was
rarely
swayed
by
his
feelings
as
an
advocate
he
was
lucid
cold
and
logical
rather
than
rhetorical
or
passionate
he
had
no
taste
for
platitudes
and
glittering
generalities
there
was
nothing
mercenary
in
his
practice
and
with
rare
conscientiousness
he
measured
his
charges
by
the
services
rendered
contented
if
the
fees
were
small
he
carried
the
strictest
honesty
into
his
calling
which
greatly
added
to
his
influence
if
there
was
ever
an
honest
lawyer
he
was
doubtless
one
even
in
arguing
a
case
he
never
misrepresented
the
evidence
of
a
witness
and
was
always
candid
and
fair
he
would
frequently
against
his
own
interest
persuade
a
litigant
of
the
injustice
of
his
case
and
induce
him
to
throw
it
up
if
not
the
undisputed
leader
of
his
circuit
he
was
the
most
beloved
sometimes
he
disturbed
the
court
by
his
droll
and
humorous
illustrations
which
called
out
irrepressible
laughter
but
generally
he
was
grave
and
earnest
in
matters
of
importance
and
he
was
always
at
home
in
the
courtroom
quiet
collected
and
dignified
awkward
as
was
his
figure
and
his
gesticulation
but
it
was
not
as
a
lawyer
that
lincoln
was
famous
nor
as
a
public
speaker
would
he
compare
with
douglas
in
eloquence
or
renown
as
a
member
of
congress
it
is
not
probable
that
he
would
ever
have
taken
a
commanding
rank
like
clay
or
webster
or
calhoun
or
even
like
seward
his
great
fame
rests
on
his
moral
character
his
identification
with
a
great
cause
his
marvellous
ability
as
a
conservative
defender
of
radical
principles
and
his
no
less
wonderful
tact
as
a
leader
of
men
the
cause
for
which
he
stands
was
the
antislavery
movement
as
it
grew
into
a
political
necessity
rather
than
as
a
protest
against
moral
evil
although
from
his
youth
an
antislavery
man
lincoln
was
not
an
abolitionist
in
the
early
days
of
the
slavery
agitation
he
rather
kept
aloof
from
the
discussion
although
such
writers
as
theodore
parker
channing
and
horace
greeley
had
great
charm
for
him
he
was
a
politician
and
therefore
discreet
in
the
avowal
of
opinions
his
turn
of
mind
was
conservative
and
moderate
and
therefore
he
thought
that
all
political
action
should
be
along
the
lines
established
by
law
under
the
constitution
but
when
the
southern
leaders
not
content
with
by
congress
with
their
favorite
institution
in
their
own
states
sought
to
compel
congress
to
allow
the
extension
of
slavery
in
the
territories
it
controlled
then
the
indignation
of
lincoln
burst
the
bounds
and
he
became
the
leader
in
his
state
in
opposition
to
any
movement
to
establish
in
national
territory
that
institution
founded
on
both
injustice
and
bad
policy
although
he
was
in
congress
in
his
political
career
really
began
about
the
year
four
years
after
the
death
of
calhoun
as
has
been
shown
in
previous
chapters
the
great
slavery
agitation
of
when
the
whole
country
was
convulsed
by
discussions
and
ominous
threats
of
disunion
was
laid
at
rest
for
a
while
by
the
celebrated
compromise
bill
which
henry
clay
succeeded
in
passing
through
congress
by
the
terms
of
this
compromise
california
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
a
free
state
the
territories
of
new
mexico
and
utah
were
organized
to
come
in
as
states
with
or
without
slavery
as
their
people
might
determine
when
the
time
should
arrive
the
domestic
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
abolished
a
more
stringent
law
was
passed
and
for
the
adjustment
of
state
boundaries
which
reduced
the
positive
in
texas
and
threw
it
into
the
debatable
territory
of
new
mexico
texas
received
ten
millions
of
dollars
although
this
adjustment
was
not
entirely
satisfactory
to
either
the
north
or
the
south
the
nation
settled
itself
for
a
period
of
quiet
to
repair
the
waste
and
utilize
the
conquests
of
the
mexican
war
it
became
absorbed
in
the
expansion
of
its
commerce
the
development
of
its
manufactures
and
the
growth
of
its
emigration
all
quickened
by
the
richness
of
its
marvellous
new
until
unexpectedly
and
suddenly
it
found
itself
once
again
plunged
into
political
controversy
more
distracting
and
more
ominous
than
the
worst
it
had
yet
experienced
for
while
calmly
accepting
the
divers
political
arrangements
made
for
distant
states
and
territories
the
men
of
the
north
who
had
fumed
and
argued
against
the
passage
of
the
law
when
its
enforcement
was
attempted
in
their
very
presence
were
altogether
outraged
when
the
chased
and
caught
negroes
in
their
village
and
city
streets
when
free
men
were
summoned
to
obey
that
law
by
helping
to
seize
trembling
fugitives
and
send
them
back
to
worse
than
death
then
they
burst
forth
in
a
fierce
storm
of
rage
that
could
not
be
quieted
the
agitation
rose
and
spread
lecturers
thundered
newspapers
denounced
great
meetings
were
held
politicians
trembled
and
even
yet
the
conservatism
of
the
north
was
not
wholly
inflamed
for
political
partisanship
is
in
itself
a
kind
of
slavery
and
while
the
northern
democrats
stood
squarely
with
the
south
the
northern
whigs
fearing
division
and
defeat
made
strenuous
efforts
to
stand
on
both
sides
and
admitting
slavery
to
be
an
evil
to
uphold
the
law
because
it
was
a
part
of
the
great
compromise
in
congress
and
out
in
national
conventions
and
with
all
the
power
of
the
party
press
this
view
was
strenuously
advocated
but
in
the
democrats
elected
franklin
pierce
as
president
while
the
compromising
whigs
were
cast
out
webster
the
leader
of
the
compromisers
had
not
even
secured
a
nomination
but
general
scott
was
the
whig
candidate
while
william
seward
at
the
head
of
the
antislavery
whigs
had
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
amid
the
dissolving
elements
of
the
whig
party
the
antislavery
sentiment
was
gaining
strength
day
by
day
the
old
issues
of
tariffs
and
internal
improvements
were
losing
their
vitality
while
and
were
the
new
poles
about
which
new
crystallizations
were
beginning
to
form
but
the
compromise
of
had
loosed
from
its
pandora
box
another
fomenter
of
trouble
in
the
idea
of
leaving
to
the
people
of
the
territories
the
settlement
of
whether
their
incoming
states
should
be
slave
or
free
the
doctrine
of
popular
sovereignty
as
it
was
called
the
nation
had
accepted
that
theory
as
a
makeshift
for
the
emergency
of
that
day
but
slave
cultivation
had
already
exhausted
much
of
the
southern
land
and
not
content
with
utah
and
new
mexico
for
their
propagandism
the
slaveholders
cast
envious
eyes
upon
the
great
territory
of
the
northwest
stretching
out
from
the
missouri
border
although
it
was
north
of
the
prohibited
line
of
and
so
it
came
about
that
within
four
short
years
after
the
compromise
of
the
unrest
of
the
north
under
the
law
followed
by
the
efforts
of
the
south
to
break
down
the
earlier
compromise
of
awoke
again
with
renewed
fierceness
the
slavery
agitation
in
discussing
the
bill
for
the
organization
of
the
territories
of
kansas
and
nebraska
an
immense
area
extending
from
the
borders
of
missouri
iowa
and
minnesota
west
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
from
the
line
of
north
to
british
america
the
mover
of
the
bill
stephen
douglas
senator
from
illinois
a
democrat
and
a
man
of
remarkable
abilities
now
came
into
prominent
notice
he
wanted
to
be
president
of
the
united
states
and
his
popularity
his
legal
attainments
his
congressional
services
his
attractive
eloquence
and
skill
in
debate
marked
him
out
as
the
rising
man
of
his
party
he
was
a
vermonter
by
birth
and
like
lincoln
had
arisen
from
nothing
a
man
so
talented
that
the
people
called
him
the
little
giant
but
nevertheless
inferior
to
the
giants
who
had
led
the
senate
for
twenty
years
while
equal
to
them
in
ambition
and
superior
as
a
politician
he
was
among
those
who
at
first
supposed
that
the
missouri
compromise
of
was
a
final
settlement
and
was
hostile
to
the
further
agitation
of
the
slavery
question
he
was
a
great
believer
in
american
destiny
and
the
absorption
of
all
north
america
in
one
grand
confederation
in
certain
portions
of
which
slavery
should
be
tolerated
as
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
on
territories
he
had
great
influence
in
opening
new
routes
of
travel
and
favored
the
extension
of
white
settlements
even
in
territory
which
had
been
given
to
the
indians
to
further
his
ambitious
aspirations
douglas
began
now
to
court
the
favor
of
southern
leaders
and
introduced
his
famous
bill
which
was
virtually
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
inasmuch
as
it
opened
the
vast
territories
to
the
north
of
to
the
introduction
of
slavery
if
their
people
should
so
elect
this
the
south
needed
to
secure
what
they
called
the
balance
of
power
but
what
was
really
the
preponderance
of
the
slave
states
or
at
least
the
curtailment
of
the
political
power
of
the
free
states
in
during
the
administration
of
franklin
pierce
and
under
the
domination
of
the
democratic
party
which
played
into
the
hands
of
the
southern
leaders
the
compromise
which
clay
had
effected
in
was
repealed
under
the
influence
of
his
compromise
of
and
the
slavery
question
was
thus
reopened
for
political
discussion
in
every
state
of
the
union
showing
how
dangerous
it
is
to
compromise
principle
in
shaping
a
policy
popular
indignation
at
the
north
knew
no
bounds
at
this
new
retrograde
movement
the
whigs
uttered
protests
while
the
party
just
coming
into
notice
composed
mainly
of
moderate
antislavery
men
from
both
the
old
parties
were
loud
in
their
denunciations
of
the
encroachments
of
the
south
even
some
leading
democrats
opened
their
eyes
and
joined
the
rising
party
the
newspapers
the
pulpits
and
the
platforms
sent
forth
a
united
cry
of
wrath
the
whigs
and
the
abolitionists
were
plainly
approaching
each
other
the
year
saw
a
continuous
and
solid
political
campaign
to
repress
the
further
spread
of
slavery
the
territories
being
then
thrown
open
there
now
began
an
intense
emulation
to
people
them
on
the
one
hand
with
advocates
of
slavery
and
on
the
other
with
emigration
societies
were
founded
to
assist
settlers
and
a
great
tide
of
families
poured
into
kansas
from
the
northern
states
while
the
southern
states
and
chiefly
missouri
sent
also
large
numbers
of
men
at
the
south
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
was
universally
welcomed
and
the
southern
leaders
felt
encouragement
and
exultation
the
south
had
gained
a
great
victory
aided
by
northern
democrats
and
boldly
denounced
chase
hale
sumner
seward
and
giddings
in
the
congress
as
incendiaries
plotting
to
destroy
precious
rights
a
memorable
contest
took
place
in
the
house
of
representatives
to
prevent
the
election
of
banks
of
massachusetts
as
speaker
but
the
tide
was
beginning
to
turn
and
banks
by
a
vote
of
against
obtained
the
speakership
then
followed
border
ruffianism
in
kansas
when
armed
invaders
from
missouri
casting
thousands
of
illegal
votes
elected
by
fraud
and
violence
a
legislature
favorable
to
slavery
accompanied
with
civil
war
in
which
the
most
disgraceful
outrages
were
perpetrated
the
central
government
at
washington
being
blind
and
deaf
and
dumb
to
it
all
the
settlers
in
kansas
who
were
opposed
to
slavery
then
assembled
at
topeka
refused
to
recognize
the
bogus
laws
and
framed
a
constitution
which
president
pierce
a
northern
man
with
southern
principles
gentlemanly
and
cultivated
but
not
strong
pronounced
to
be
revolutionary
nor
was
ruffianism
confined
to
kansas
in
charles
sumner
of
massachusetts
one
of
the
most
eloquent
and
forceful
denunciators
of
all
the
lawlessness
was
attacked
at
his
desk
in
the
senate
chamber
after
an
adjournment
and
unmercifully
beaten
with
a
heavy
cane
by
preston
brooks
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
nephew
of
senator
butler
of
south
carolina
it
took
years
for
sumner
to
recover
while
the
aristocratic
ruffian
was
unmolested
and
went
unpunished
for
though
censured
by
the
house
and
compelled
to
resign
his
seat
he
was
immediately
by
his
constituents
but
this
was
not
all
in
that
same
year
the
supreme
court
came
to
the
aid
of
the
south
already
supported
by
the
executive
and
the
senate
six
judges
out
of
nine
headed
by
chief
justice
taney
pronounced
judgment
that
slaves
whether
fugitive
or
taken
by
their
masters
into
the
free
states
should
be
returned
to
their
owners
this
celebrated
case
arose
in
missouri
where
a
negro
named
dred
scott
who
had
been
taken
by
his
master
to
states
where
slavery
was
prohibited
by
law
who
had
with
his
master
consent
married
and
had
children
in
the
free
states
and
been
brought
back
to
missouri
sued
for
his
freedom
the
local
court
granted
it
the
highest
court
of
the
state
reversed
the
decision
and
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
the
case
was
twice
argued
there
and
excited
a
wide
and
deep
interest
the
court
might
have
simply
sent
it
back
as
a
matter
belonging
to
the
state
court
to
decide
but
it
permitted
itself
to
argue
the
question
throughout
and
pronounced
on
the
natural
inferiority
of
the
negro
and
his
legal
condition
as
property
the
competence
of
the
state
courts
to
decide
his
freedom
or
slavery
and
the
right
of
slaveholders
under
the
constitution
to
control
their
property
in
the
free
states
or
territories
any
legislation
by
congress
or
local
legislatures
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
this
was
the
climax
of
slavery
triumphs
the
north
and
west
at
last
aroused
declared
in
conventions
and
legislative
halls
that
slavery
should
advance
no
further
the
conflict
now
indeed
became
irrepressible
at
this
crisis
abraham
lincoln
stepped
upon
the
political
stage
and
his
great
career
began
as
a
local
lawyer
even
as
a
local
politician
his
work
was
practically
done
he
came
forth
as
an
avowed
antagonist
of
douglas
who
was
the
strongest
man
in
illinois
and
the
leader
of
the
democratic
party
in
congress
he
came
forth
as
the
champion
of
the
antislavery
cause
in
his
native
state
and
soon
attracted
the
eyes
of
the
whole
nation
his
memorable
controversy
with
douglas
was
the
of
his
life
he
became
a
statesman
as
well
as
a
patriot
broad
lofty
and
indignant
at
wrongs
theretofore
he
had
been
a
conservative
whig
a
devoted
follower
of
clay
but
as
soon
as
the
missouri
compromise
was
repealed
he
put
forth
his
noblest
energies
in
behalf
of
justice
of
right
and
of
humanity
as
he
was
driving
one
day
from
a
little
town
in
which
court
had
been
held
a
brother
lawyer
said
to
him
lincoln
the
time
is
coming
when
we
shall
either
be
abolitionists
or
democrats
to
which
he
replied
musingly
when
that
time
comes
my
mind
is
made
up
for
i
believe
the
slavery
question
can
never
be
successfully
compromised
and
when
his
mind
was
made
up
after
earnest
deliberation
he
rarely
changed
it
and
became
as
firm
as
a
rock
his
convictions
were
exceedingly
strong
and
few
influences
could
shake
them
that
quiet
conversation
in
his
buggy
in
a
retired
road
with
a
brother
lawyer
was
a
political
baptism
he
had
taken
his
stand
on
one
side
of
a
great
question
which
would
rend
in
twain
the
whole
country
and
make
a
mighty
conflagration
out
of
whose
fires
the
truth
should
come
victorious
the
whig
party
was
now
politically
dead
and
the
republican
party
arose
composed
of
conscientious
and
men
from
all
the
old
organizations
not
afraid
to
put
principle
before
party
conservative
and
yet
deeply
aroused
on
the
great
issue
of
the
day
and
united
against
the
further
extension
of
slavery
organizing
with
great
enthusiasm
for
a
first
presidential
campaign
in
under
frémont
the
pathfinder
as
their
candidate
they
were
defeated
and
james
buchanan
the
democratic
candidate
became
president
but
accepting
defeat
as
a
lesson
toward
victory
they
grew
stronger
and
stronger
every
day
until
at
last
they
swept
the
country
and
secured
to
the
principle
of
slavery
complete
representation
in
the
national
government
lincoln
who
was
in
the
republican
candidate
for
united
states
senator
from
illinois
while
douglas
sought
the
votes
of
the
democracy
first
entered
the
lists
against
his
rival
at
springfield
in
a
speech
attacking
that
wily
politician
position
as
to
the
decision
he
tried
to
force
douglas
to
a
declaration
of
the
logical
consequence
of
his
position
namely
that
while
he
upheld
the
decision
as
a
wise
interpretation
of
the
rights
of
the
to
hold
slaves
in
the
territories
yet
the
people
of
a
territory
under
the
great
principle
of
popular
sovereignty
which
was
douglas
chief
stock
in
trade
could
exclude
slavery
from
its
limits
even
before
it
had
formed
a
state
constitution
if
we
succeed
in
bringing
him
to
this
point
he
wrote
a
friend
he
will
say
that
slavery
can
not
actually
exist
in
the
territories
unless
the
people
desire
it
which
will
offend
the
south
if
douglas
did
not
answer
lincoln
question
he
would
jeopardize
his
election
as
senator
if
he
did
answer
he
would
offend
the
south
for
his
doctrine
of
squatter
sovereignty
conflicted
not
only
with
the
interests
of
slavery
but
with
his
defence
of
the
decision
a
fact
which
lincoln
was
not
slow
to
point
out
douglas
did
answer
and
the
result
was
as
lincoln
predicted
the
position
taken
by
lincoln
himself
in
the
debate
was
bold
and
clear
said
he
a
house
divided
against
itself
can
not
stand
i
believe
this
government
can
not
endure
and
either
the
opponents
of
slavery
will
avert
the
further
spread
of
it
and
place
it
where
the
public
mind
shall
rest
in
the
belief
that
it
is
in
the
course
of
ultimate
extinction
or
its
advocates
will
push
it
forward
till
it
shall
become
alike
lawful
in
all
the
states
old
as
well
as
new
north
as
well
as
south
when
his
friends
objected
that
this
kind
of
talk
would
defeat
him
for
senatorship
he
replied
but
it
is
i
would
rather
be
defeated
with
these
expressions
in
my
speech
held
up
and
discussed
before
the
people
than
be
victorious
without
it
he
was
defeated
but
the
debates
made
his
fame
national
and
resulted
in
his
being
president
while
the
politic
douglas
gained
the
senatorship
and
lost
the
greater
prize
in
these
famous
debates
between
the
leaders
lincoln
proved
himself
quite
the
equal
of
his
antagonist
who
was
already
famous
as
a
trained
and
prompt
debater
lincoln
canvassed
the
state
he
made
in
one
campaign
as
many
as
fifty
speeches
it
is
impossible
within
my
narrow
limits
to
go
into
the
details
of
those
great
debates
in
them
lincoln
rose
above
all
technicalities
and
sophistries
and
not
only
planted
himself
on
eternal
right
but
showed
marvellous
political
wisdom
the
keynote
of
all
his
utterances
was
that
a
house
divided
against
itself
could
not
stand
yet
he
did
not
pass
beyond
the
constitutional
limit
in
his
argument
he
admitted
the
right
of
the
south
to
a
law
and
the
right
of
a
territory
to
enact
slavery
for
itself
on
becoming
a
state
he
favored
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
only
on
the
request
of
its
inhabitants
and
would
forward
the
colonization
of
the
negroes
in
liberia
if
they
wished
it
and
their
masters
consented
he
was
a
pronounced
antislavery
man
but
not
an
abolitionist
and
took
with
the
great
mass
of
the
northerners
a
firm
stand
against
the
of
slavery
it
was
this
intuitive
perception
of
the
of
the
situation
that
made
him
and
kept
him
the
remarkable
representative
of
the
northern
people
that
he
was
to
the
very
end
lincoln
gained
so
much
fame
from
his
contest
with
douglas
that
he
was
during
the
spring
of
the
following
year
invited
to
speak
in
the
eastern
states
and
in
the
great
hall
of
the
cooper
institute
in
new
york
in
february
he
addressed
a
magnificent
audience
presided
over
by
bryant
the
poet
he
had
made
elaborate
preparation
for
this
speech
which
was
a
careful
review
of
the
slavery
question
from
the
foundation
of
the
republic
to
that
time
and
a
masterly
analysis
of
the
relative
positions
of
political
parties
to
it
the
address
made
a
deep
impression
the
speaker
was
simply
introduced
as
a
distinguished
politician
from
the
west
the
speech
was
a
surprise
to
those
who
were
familiar
with
western
oratory
there
was
no
attempt
at
rhetoric
but
the
address
was
pure
logic
from
beginning
to
end
like
an
argument
before
the
supreme
court
and
exceedingly
forcible
the
chief
point
made
was
the
political
necessity
of
excluding
slavery
from
the
territories
the
orator
did
not
dwell
on
slavery
as
a
crime
but
as
a
wrong
which
had
gradually
been
forced
upon
the
nation
the
remedy
for
which
was
not
in
violent
denunciations
he
did
not
abuse
the
south
he
simply
pleaded
for
harmony
in
the
republican
ranks
and
avoided
giving
offence
to
extreme
partisans
on
any
side
contending
that
if
slavery
could
be
excluded
from
the
territories
it
would
gradually
become
extinct
as
both
unprofitable
and
unjust
he
would
tolerate
slavery
within
its
present
limits
and
even
return
fugitive
slaves
to
their
owners
according
to
the
laws
but
would
not
extend
the
evil
where
it
did
not
at
present
exist
as
it
was
a
wrong
it
must
not
be
perpetuated
the
moderation
of
this
speech
coming
from
an
illinois
politician
did
much
to
draw
attention
to
him
as
a
possible
future
candidate
for
the
presidency
to
which
by
this
time
he
undoubtedly
aspired
and
why
not
he
was
the
leader
of
his
party
in
illinois
a
great
who
had
defeated
douglas
himself
in
debate
a
shrewd
cool
man
looking
to
the
future
rather
than
the
present
and
political
friends
had
already
gathered
about
him
as
a
strong
political
factor
lincoln
after
his
great
speech
in
new
york
returned
to
his
home
he
had
a
few
years
before
given
some
political
speeches
in
boston
and
the
adjacent
towns
which
were
well
received
but
made
no
deep
impression
from
no
fault
of
his
but
simply
because
he
had
not
the
right
material
to
work
upon
where
culture
was
more
in
demand
than
vigor
of
intellect
indeed
one
result
of
the
election
of
lincoln
and
of
the
war
which
followed
was
to
open
the
eyes
of
eastern
people
to
the
intellect
and
intelligence
of
the
west
western
lawyers
and
politicians
might
not
have
the
culture
of
sumner
the
polished
elocution
of
everett
the
urbanity
of
van
buren
and
the
courtly
manners
of
winthrop
but
they
had
a
faculty
for
and
great
political
sagacity
and
they
were
generally
more
in
sympathy
with
the
people
having
mostly
sprung
from
their
ranks
their
hard
and
rugged
intellects
on
the
floor
of
congress
where
every
one
is
soon
judged
according
to
his
merits
and
not
according
to
his
clothes
and
the
east
saw
that
thereafter
political
power
would
centre
in
the
west
and
dominate
the
whole
country
against
which
it
was
useless
to
complain
or
rebel
since
according
to
all
political
axioms
the
majority
will
rule
and
ought
to
rule
and
the
more
the
east
saw
of
the
leading
men
of
the
west
the
more
it
respected
their
force
of
mind
their
broad
and
comprehensive
views
and
their
fitness
for
high
place
under
the
government
it
was
not
the
people
of
the
united
states
who
called
for
the
nomination
of
lincoln
as
in
the
case
of
general
jackson
he
was
not
much
known
outside
of
illinois
except
as
a
skilful
debater
and
stump
orator
he
had
filled
no
high
office
to
bring
him
before
the
eyes
of
the
nation
he
was
not
a
general
covered
with
military
laurels
nor
a
senator
in
congress
nor
governor
of
a
large
state
nor
a
cabinet
officer
no
man
had
thus
far
been
nominated
for
president
unless
he
was
a
military
success
or
was
in
the
line
of
party
promotion
though
a
party
leader
in
illinois
lincoln
was
simply
a
private
citizen
with
no
antecedents
which
marked
him
out
for
such
exalted
position
but
he
was
available
a
man
who
could
be
trusted
moderate
in
his
views
a
whig
and
yet
committed
to
antislavery
views
of
great
logical
powers
and
on
all
the
political
issues
of
the
day
he
was
not
likely
to
be
rash
or
impulsive
or
hasty
or
to
stand
in
the
way
of
political
aspirants
he
was
eminently
a
safe
man
in
an
approaching
crisis
with
a
judicial
intellect
and
above
all
a
man
without
enemies
whom
few
envied
and
some
laughed
at
for
his
grotesque
humor
and
awkward
manners
he
was
also
modest
and
unpretending
and
had
the
tact
to
veil
his
ambition
in
his
own
state
he
was
exceedingly
popular
it
was
not
strange
therefore
that
the
illinois
republican
state
convention
nominated
him
as
their
presidential
candidate
to
be
supported
in
the
larger
national
convention
about
to
assemble
in
may
the
memorable
national
republican
convention
met
in
chicago
in
an
immense
building
called
the
wigwam
to
select
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
among
the
prominent
republican
leaders
were
seward
chase
cameron
dayton
and
bates
the
eastern
people
supposed
that
seward
would
receive
the
nomination
from
his
conceded
ability
his
political
experience
his
prominence
as
an
antislavery
whig
and
the
prestige
of
office
but
he
had
enemies
and
an
unconciliatory
disposition
it
soon
became
evident
that
he
could
not
carry
all
the
states
the
contest
was
between
seward
chase
and
lincoln
and
when
on
the
third
ballot
lincoln
received
within
a
vote
and
of
the
majority
ohio
gave
him
four
votes
from
chase
and
then
delegation
after
delegation
changed
its
vote
for
the
victor
and
amid
great
enthusiasm
the
nomination
became
unanimous
the
election
followed
and
lincoln
the
republican
received
one
hundred
and
eighty
electoral
votes
breckinridge
the
southern
democrat
bell
of
the
union
ticket
the
last
fragment
of
the
old
whig
party
and
douglas
of
the
northern
democracy
but
twelve
the
became
president
of
the
united
states
and
senator
hannibal
hamlin
of
maine
vice
president
it
was
a
victory
of
ideas
it
was
the
triumph
of
the
north
over
the
south
of
the
aroused
conscience
and
intelligence
of
the
people
against
bigotry
arrogance
and
wrong
men
and
measures
in
that
great
contest
paled
before
the
grandeur
of
everlasting
principles
it
was
not
for
lincoln
that
bonfires
were
kindled
and
cannons
roared
and
bells
were
rung
and
huzzas
ascended
to
heaven
but
for
the
great
check
given
to
the
which
since
the
formation
of
the
constitution
had
dominated
the
nation
the
republicans
did
not
gain
a
majority
of
the
popular
vote
as
the
combined
opposing
tickets
cast
votes
more
than
they
but
their
vote
was
much
larger
than
that
for
any
other
ticket
and
gave
them
a
handsome
majority
in
the
electoral
college
between
the
election
in
november
and
the
following
march
when
lincoln
took
the
reins
of
government
several
of
the
southern
states
had
already
seceded
from
the
union
and
had
organized
a
government
at
montgomery
making
the
excuse
of
the
election
of
a
sectional
and
minority
president
they
had
put
into
effect
the
action
for
which
their
leaders
during
several
months
had
been
secretly
preparing
they
had
seized
nearly
all
the
federal
forts
arsenals
and
within
their
limits
while
a
large
number
of
the
officers
of
the
united
states
army
and
navy
had
resigned
and
entered
into
their
service
on
the
principle
that
the
authority
of
their
states
was
paramount
to
the
federal
power
amid
all
these
preparations
for
war
on
the
part
of
the
seceding
states
and
the
seizure
of
federal
property
buchanan
was
irresolute
and
perplexed
he
was
doubtless
patriotic
and
honest
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
the
state
of
things
was
much
more
serious
than
when
south
carolina
threatened
to
secede
in
the
time
of
general
jackson
the
want
of
firmness
and
decision
on
the
part
of
the
president
has
been
severely
criticised
but
it
seems
to
me
to
have
been
not
without
excuse
in
the
perplexing
conditions
of
the
time
while
it
was
certainly
fortunate
that
he
did
not
precipitate
the
crisis
by
sending
troops
to
reinforce
fort
sumter
in
charleston
harbor
which
was
invested
and
threatened
by
south
carolina
troops
the
contest
was
inevitable
anyway
and
the
management
of
the
war
was
better
in
the
hands
of
lincoln
than
it
could
have
been
in
those
of
buchanan
with
traitors
in
his
cabinet
or
even
after
they
had
left
and
a
new
and
loyal
cabinet
was
summoned
but
with
an
undecided
man
at
the
head
there
was
needed
a
new
and
stronger
government
when
hostilities
should
actually
break
out
on
the
of
march
the
inauguration
of
lincoln
took
place
and
well
do
i
remember
the
ceremony
the
day
was
warm
and
beautiful
and
nature
smiled
in
mockery
of
the
bloody
tragedy
which
was
so
soon
to
follow
i
mingled
with
the
crowd
at
the
eastern
portico
of
the
capitol
and
was
so
fortunate
as
to
hear
and
see
all
that
took
place
the
high
officials
who
surrounded
the
president
his
own
sad
and
pensive
face
his
awkward
but
not
undignified
person
arrayed
in
a
faultless
suit
of
black
the
long
address
he
made
the
oath
of
office
administered
by
chief
justice
taney
and
the
dispersion
of
the
civil
and
military
functionaries
to
their
homes
it
was
not
a
great
pageant
but
was
an
impressive
gathering
society
in
which
the
southern
element
predominated
sneered
at
the
tall
ruler
who
had
learned
so
few
of
its
graces
and
insincerities
and
took
but
little
note
of
the
in
the
political
atmosphere
the
distant
rumblings
which
heralded
the
approaching
storm
so
soon
to
break
with
satanic
force
the
inaugural
address
was
not
only
an
earnest
appeal
for
peace
but
a
calm
and
steadfast
announcement
of
the
policy
of
the
government
and
a
putting
of
the
responsibility
for
any
bloodshed
upon
those
who
should
resist
the
law
two
brief
paragraphs
contain
the
whole
the
power
confided
to
me

be
used
to
hold
occupy
and
possess
the
property
and
places
belonging
to
the
government
and
to
collect
the
duties
and
imposts
but
beyond
what
may
be
necessary
for
these
objects
there
will
be
no
invasion
no
use
of
force
among
the
people
anywhere
in
your
hands
my
dissatisfied
and
not
in
mine
is
the
momentous
issue
of
civil
war
the
government
will
not
assail
you
you
can
have
no
conflict
without
being
yourselves
the
aggressors
this
was
the
original
chart
of
the
course
which
the
president
followed
and
his
final
justification
when
by
use
of
the
power
confided
to
him
he
had
accomplished
the
complete
restoration
of
the
authority
of
the
federal
union
over
all
the
vast
territory
which
the
seceded
states
had
seized
and
so
desperately
tried

control

dollars
but
actual
hostilities
had
not
as
yet
commenced
the
confederates
during
the
close
of
buchanan
administration
were
not
without
hopes
of
a
peaceful
settlement
and
recognition
of
secession
and
several
conferences
had
taken
place
one
overture
being
made
even
to
the
new
administration
but
of
course
in
vain
the
spark
which
kindled
the
conflagration
but
little
more
than
a
month
after
lincoln
inauguration
april
was
the
firing
on
fort
sumter
and
its
surrender
to
the
south
carolinians
this
aroused
both
the
indignation
and
the
military
enthusiasm
of
the
north
which
in
a
single
day
was
as
by
a
lightning
flash
fused
in
a
white
heat
of
patriotism
and
a
desire
to
avenge
the
dishonored
flag
for
the
time
all
party
lines
disappeared
and
the
whole
population
were
united
and
solid
in
defence
of
the
union
both
sides
now
prepared
to
fight
in
good
earnest
the
sword
was
drawn
the
scabbard
thrown
away
both
sides
were
confident
of
victory
the
southern
leaders
were
under
the
delusion
that
the
yankees
would
not
fight
and
that
they
cared
more
for
dollars
than
for
their
country
moreover
the
southern
states
had
long
been
training
their
young
men
in
the
military
schools
and
had
for
months
been
collecting
materials
of
war
as
cotton
was
an
acknowledged
king
the
planters
calculated
on
the
support
of
england
which
could
not
do
without
their
bales
lastly
they
knew
that
the
north
had
been
divided
against
itself
and
that
the
democratic
politicians
sympathized
with
them
in
reference
to
slavery
the
federal
leaders
on
the
other
hand
relied
on
the
force
of
numbers
of
wealth
and
national
prestige
very
few
supposed
that
the
contest
would
be
protracted
seward
thought
that
it
would
not
last
over
three
months
nor
did
the
south
think
of
conquering
the
north
but
supposed
it
could
secure
its
own
independence
it
certainly
was
resolved
on
making
a
desperate
fight
to
defend
its
peculiar
institution
as
it
was
generally
thought
in
england
that
this
attempt
would
succeed
as
england
had
no
special
love
for
the
union
and
as
the
union
and
not
opposition
to
slavery
was
the
rallying
cry
of
the
north
england
gave
to
the
south
its
moral
support
lincoln
assumed
his
burden
with
great
modesty
but
with
a
steady
firmness
and
determination
and
surprised
his
cabinet
by
his
force
of
will
nicolay
and
hay
relate
an
anecdote
of
great
significance
seward
who
occupied
the
first
place
in
the
cabinet
which
he
deserved
on
account
of
his
experience
and
abilities
was
not
altogether
pleased
with
the
slow
progress
of
things
and
wrote
to
lincoln
an
extraordinary
letter
in
less
than
a
month
after
his
inauguration
suggesting
more
active
operations
with
specific
memoranda
of
a
proposed
policy
whatever
policy
we
adopt
said
he
there
must
be
an
energetic
prosecution
of
it
for
this
purpose
it
must
be
somebody
business
to
pursue
and
direct
it
incessantly
either
the
president
must
do
it
himself
or
devolve
it
on
some
member
of
his
cabinet
it
is
not
my
especial
province
but
i
neither
seek
to
evade
nor
assume
responsibility
in
brief
it
was
an
intimation
if
you
feel
not
equal
to
the
emergency
perhaps
you
can
find
a
man
not
a
thousand
miles
away
who
is
equal
to
it
lincoln
in
his
reply
showed
transcendent
tact
although
an
inexperienced
local
politician
suddenly
placed
at
the
head
of
a
great
nation
in
a
tremendous
crisis
and
surrounded
in
his
cabinet
and
in
congress
by
men
of
acknowledged
expert
ability
in
statecraft
he
had
his
own
ideas
but
he
needed
the
counsel
and
help
of
these
men
as
well
he
could
not
afford
to
part
with
the
services
of
a
man
like
seward
nor
would
he
offend
him
by
any
assumption
of
dignity
or
resentment
at
his
unasked
advice
he
replied
in
substance
the
policy
laid
down
in
my
inaugural
met
your
distinct
approval
and
it
has
thus
far
been
exactly
followed
as
to
attending
to
its
prosecution
if
this
must
be
done
i
must
do
it
and
i
wish
and
suppose
i
am
entitled
to
have
the
advice
of
all
the
cabinet
after
this
no
member
of
the
cabinet
dared
to
attempt
to
usurp
any
authority
which
belonged
to
the
elected
of
the
army
and
navy
unless
it
were
chase
at
a
later
time
as
the
head
of
the
government
in
whom
supreme
federal
power
was
invested
in
time
of
war
lincoln
was
willing
and
eager
to
consult
his
cabinet
but
reserved
his
decisions
and
assumed
all
responsibilities
he
probably
made
mistakes
but
who
could
have
done
better
on
the
whole
the
choice
of
the
nation
was
justified
by
results
it
is
not
my
object
in
this
paper
to
attempt
to
compress
the
political
and
military
history
of
the
united
states
during
the
memorable
administration
of
lincoln
if
one
wishes
to
know
the
details
he
must
go
to
the
ten
octavo
biographical
volumes
of
lincoln
private
secretaries
to
the
huge
and
voluminous
quarto
reports
of
the
government
to
the
multifarious
books
on
the
war
and
its
actors
i
can
only
glance
at
salient
points
and
even
here
i
must
confine
myself
to
those
movements
which
are
intimately
connected
with
the
agency
and
influence
of
lincoln
himself
it
is
his
life
and
not
a
history
of
the
war
that
it
is
my
business
to
present
nor
has
the
time
come
for
an
impartial
and
luminous
account
of
the
greatest
event
of
modern
times
the
jealousy
and
dissensions
of
generals
the
prejudices
of
the
people
both
north
and
south
the
uncertainty
and
inconsistency
of
much
of
the
material
published
and
the
conceit
of
politicians
alike
prevent
a
history
which
will
be
satisfactory
no
matter
how
gifted
and
learned
may
be
the
historian
when
all
the
actors
of
that
famous
tragedy
both
great
and
small
have
passed
away
new
light
will
appear
and
poetry
will
add
her
charms
to
what
is
now
too
hideous
a
reality
glorious
as
were
the
achievements
of
heroes
and
statesmen
after
the
battle
of
bull
run
july
won
by
the
confederate
general
beauregard
over
general
mcdowell
against
all
expectation
to
the
dismay
and
indignation
of
the
whole
north
the
result
of
on
the
part
of
the
union
troops
and
a
wretchedly
mismanaged
affair
the
attention
of
the
federal
government
was
mainly
directed
to
the
defence
of
washington
which
might
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
had
the
victors
been
confident
and
quick
enough
to
pursue
the
advantage
they
had
gained
for
nothing
could
exceed
the
panic
at
the
capital
after
the
disastrous
defeat
of
mcdowell
the
demoralization
of
the
union
forces
was
awful
happily
the
condition
of
the
confederate
troops
was
not
much
better
but
the
country
rallied
after
the
crisis
had
passed
lincoln
issued
his
proclamation
for
five
hundred
thousand
additional
men
congress
authorized
as
large
a
loan
as
was
needed
the
governors
of
the
various
states
raised
regiment
after
regiment
and
sent
them
to
washington
as
the
way
through
maryland
at
first
obstructed
by
local
secessionists
was
now
clear
general
butler
having
intrenched
himself
at
baltimore
most
fortunately
the
governor
of
maryland
was
a
union
man
and
with
the
aid
of
the
northern
forces
had
repressed
the
rebellious
tendency
in
maryland
which
state
afterward
remained
permanently
in
the
union
and
offered
no
further
resistance
to
the
passage
of
federal
troops
arlington
heights
in
virginia
opposite
washington
had
already
been
fortified
by
general
scott
but
additional
defences
were
made
and
the
capital
was
out
of
danger
with
the
rapid
concentration
of
troops
at
washington
the
government
again
assumed
the
offensive
general
george
mcclellan
having
distinguished
himself
in
west
virginia
was
called
to
washington
at
the
recommendation
of
the
best
military
authorities
and
intrusted
with
the
command
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
and
soon
after
on
the
retirement
of
general
scott
now
aged
and
infirm
and
unable
to
mount
a
horse
mcclellan
took
his
place
as
commander
of
all
the
forces
of
the
united
states
at
the
beginning
of
the
rebellion
mcclellan
was
simply
a
captain
but
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
able
and
accomplished
officers
of
the
army
his
promotion
was
rapid
beyond
precedent
but
his
head
was
turned
by
his
elevation
and
he
became
arrogant
and
opinionated
and
before
long
even
insulted
the
president
and
assumed
the
airs
of
a
national
liberator
on
whose
shoulders
was
laid
the
burden
of
the
war
he
consequently
estranged
congress
offended
scott
became
distrusted
by
the
president
and
provoked
the
jealousies
of
the
other
generals
but
he
was
popular
with
the
army
and
his
subordinates
and
if
he
offended
his
superiors
his
soldiers
were
devoted
to
him
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
second
napoleon
the
best
thing
that
can
be
said
of
this
general
is
that
he
was
a
great
organizer
and
admirably
disciplined
for
their
future
encounters
the
raw
troops
which
were
placed
under
his
command
and
he
was
too
prudent
to
risk
the
lives
of
his
men
until
his
preparations
were
made
although
constantly
urged
to
attempt
if
not
impossibilities
at
least
what
was
exceedingly
hazardous
it
was
expected
by
the
president
the
secretary
of
war
and
congress
that
he
would
hasten
his
preparations
and
advance
upon
the
enemy
as
he
had
over
one
hundred
thousand
men
and
he
made
grand
promises
and
gave
assurances
that
he
would
march
speedily
upon
richmond
but
he
did
not
march
delay
succeeded
delay
under
various
pretences
to
the
disappointment
of
the
country
and
the
indignation
of
the
responsible
government
it
was
not
till
april
after
five
months
of
inaction
that
he
was
ready
to
move
upon
richmond
and
then
not
according
to
plans
but
by
a
longer
route
by
the
way
of
fortress
monroe
up
the
peninsula
between
the
york
and
james
rivers
and
not
directly
across
virginia
by
manassas
junction
which
had
been
evacuated
in
view
of
his
superior
forces
the
largest
army
theretofore
seen
on
this
continent
it
is
not
for
me
utterly
ignorant
of
military
matters
to
make
any
criticism
of
the
plan
of
operations
in
which
the
president
and
mcclellan
were
at
issue
or
to
censure
the
general
in
command
for
the
long
delay
against
the
expostulations
of
the
executive
and
of
congress
he
maintained
that
his
army
was
not
sufficiently
drilled
or
large
enough
for
an
immediate
advance
that
the
confederate
forces
were
greater
than
his
own
and
were
posted
in
impregnable
positions
he
was
always
calling
for
reinforcements
until
his
army
comprised
over
two
hundred
thousand
men
and
when
at
last
imperatively
commanded
to
move
at
any
rate
to
move
he
left
washington
not
sufficiently
defended
which
necessitated
the
withdrawal
of
mcdowell
corps
from
him
to
secure
the
safety
of
the
capital
without
enumerating
or
describing
the
terrible
battles
on
the
peninsula
and
the
change
of
base
which
practically
was
a
retreat
and
virtually
the
confession
of
failure
it
may
be
said
in
defence
or
palliation
of
mcclellan
that
it
afterwards
took
grant
with
still
greater
forces
and
when
the
confederates
were
weakened
and
demoralized
a
year
to
do
what
mcclellan
was
expected
to
do
in
three
months
the
war
had
now
been
going
on
for
more
than
a
year
without
any
decisive
results
so
far
as
the
army
of
the
potomac
was
concerned
but
on
the
contrary
with
great
disasters
and
bitter
humiliations
the
most
prodigious
efforts
had
been
made
by
the
union
troops
without
success
and
thus
far
the
confederates
had
the
best
of
it
and
were
filled
with
triumph
as
yet
no
union
generals
could
be
compared
with
lee
or
johnston
or
longstreet
or
stonewall
jackson
while
the
men
under
their
command
were
quite
equal
to
the
northern
soldiers
in
bravery
and
discipline
the
times
were
dark
and
gloomy
at
the
north
and
especially
so
to
the
president
as
of
the
army
and
navy
after
all
the
energies
he
put
forth
in
the
general
direction
of
affairs
he
was
maligned
and
misrepresented
and
ridiculed
yet
he
opened
not
his
mouth
and
kept
his
soul
in
patience
magnanimous
forbearing
and
modest
in
his
manners
and
conduct
though
intrusted
with
greater
powers
than
any
american
before
him
had
ever
exercised
he
showed
no
haughtiness
no
resentments
no
disdain
but
was
accessible
to
everybody
who
had
any
claim
on
his
time
and
was
as
simple
and
courteous
as
he
had
been
in
a
private
station
but
what
anxieties
what
silent
grief
what
a
burden
had
he
to
bear
and
here
was
his
greatness
which
endeared
him
to
the
american
heart
that
he
usurped
no
authority
offended
no
one
and
claimed
nothing
when
most
men
armed
as
he
was
with
almost
unlimited
authority
would
have
been
reserved
arrogant
and
dictatorial
he
did
not
even
assume
the
cold
dignity
which
washington
felt
it
necessary
to
put
on
but
shook
hands
told
stories
and
uttered
jokes
as
if
he
were
without
office
on
the
prairies
of
illinois
yet
all
the
while
resolute
in
purpose
and
invincible
in
spirit
an
impersonation
of
logical
intellect
before
which
everybody
succumbed
as
firm
when
he
saw
his
way
clear
as
bismarck
himself
his
tact
in
managing
men
showed
his
native
shrewdness
and
kindliness
as
well
as
the
value
of
all
his
early
training
in
the
arts
of
the
politician
always
ready
to
listen
and
to
give
men
free
chance
to
relieve
their
minds
in
talk
he
never
directly
antagonized
their
opinions
but
deftly
embodying
an
argument
in
an
apt
joke
or
story
would
manage
to
switch
them
off
from
their
track
to
his
own
without
their
exactly
perceiving
the
process
his
innate
courtesy
often
made
him
seem
uncertain
of
his
ground
but
he
probably
had
his
own
way
quite
as
frequently
as
andrew
jackson
and
without
that
irascible
old
fighter
friction
but
darker
days
were
yet
to
come
and
more
perplexing
duties
had
yet
to
be
discharged
the
president
was
obliged
to
retire
mcclellan
from
his
command
when
in
august
that
general
procrastination
could
no
longer
be
endured
mcclellan
had
made
no
fatal
blunders
was
endeared
to
his
men
and
when
it
was
obvious
that
he
could
not
take
richmond
although
within
four
miles
of
it
at
one
time
he
had
made
a
successful
and
masterly
retreat
to
harrison
landing
yet
the
campaign
against
the
confederate
capital
had
been
a
failure
as
many
believed
by
reason
of
unnecessary
delays
on
the
part
of
the
commander
and
the
president
had
to
take
the
responsibility
of
sustaining
or
removing
him
he
chose
the
latter
what
general
would
lincoln
select
to
succeed
mcclellan
he
chose
general
john
pope
but
not
with
the
powers
which
had
been
conferred
on
mcclellan
pope
had
been
graduated
at
west
point
in
had
served
with
distinction
in
the
mexican
war
and
had
also
done
good
service
in
the
west
but
it
was
his
misfortune
at
this
time
to
lose
the
second
battle
of
bull
run
or
manassas
when
there
was
no
necessity
of
lighting
he
himself
attributed
his
disaster
to
the
inaction
and
disobedience
of
general
porter
who
was
cashiered
for
it
a
verdict
which
was
reversed
by
a
careful
military
inquiry
after
the
war
defeat
was
followed
although
against
the
advice
of
the
cabinet
by
the
restoration
of
mcclellan
since
washington
was
again
in
danger
after
he
had
put
the
capital
in
safety
mcclellan
advanced
slowly
against
lee
who
had
crossed
the
potomac
into
maryland
with
designs
on
pennsylvania
he
made
his
usual
complaint
of
inadequate
forces
and
exaggerated
the
forces
of
the
enemy
he
won
however
the
battle
of
antietam
for
although
the
confederates
afterwards
claimed
that
it
was
a
drawn
battle
they
immediately
retired
but
even
then
failed
to
pursue
his
advantage
and
allowed
lee
to
recross
the
potomac
and
escape
to
the
deep
disgust
of
everybody
and
the
grief
of
lincoln
encouraged
by
continued
inaction
lee
sent
his
cavalry
under
stuart
who
with
two
thousand
men
encircled
the
federal
army
and
made
a
raid
into
pennsylvania
gathering
supplies
and
retired
again
into
virginia
unhindered
and
unharmed
the
president
now
deprived
mcclellan
again
of
his
command
and
that
general
military
career
ended
he
retired
to
private
life
emerging
again
only
as
an
unsuccessful
democratic
candidate
for
the
presidency
against
lincoln
in
it
was
a
difficult
matter
for
lincoln
to
decide
upon
a
new
general
to
command
the
army
of
the
potomac
he
made
choice
of
ambrose
burnside
the
next
in
rank
a
man
of
pleasing
address
and
a
gallant
soldier
but
not
of
sufficient
abilities
for
the
task
imposed
upon
him
the
result
was
the
greatest
military
blunder
of
the
whole
war
with
the
idea
of
advancing
directly
upon
richmond
through
fredericksburg
burnside
made
the
sad
error
of
attacking
equal
forces
strongly
intrenched
on
the
fredericksburg
heights
while
he
advanced
from
the
valley
of
the
rappahannock
below
crossing
the
river
under
a
plunging
fire
and
attacking
the
enemy
on
the
hill
it
was
a
dismal
slaughter
but
burnside
magnanimously
took
the
whole
blame
upon
himself
and
was
not
disgraced
although
removed
from
his
command
he
did
good
service
afterwards
as
a
it
was
soon
after
burnside
unfortunate
failure
at
fredericksburg
perhaps
the
gloomiest
period
of
the
war
when
military
reverses
saddened
the
whole
north
and
dissensions
in
the
cabinet
itself
added
to
the
embarrassments
of
the
president
that
lincoln
performed
the
most
momentous
act
of
his
life
and
probably
the
most
important
act
of
the
whole
war
in
his
final
proclamation
emancipating
the
slaves
and
utilizing
them
in
the
union
service
as
a
military
necessity
ever
since
the
beginning
of
hostilities
had
this
act
been
urged
upon
the
president
by
the
antislavery
men
of
the
north
a
body
growing
more
intense
and
larger
in
numbers
as
the
war
advanced
but
lincoln
remained
steady
to
his
original
purpose
of
the
union
with
or
without
slavery
naturally
and
always
opposed
to
slavery
he
did
not
believe
that
he
had
any
right
to
indulge
his
private
feeling
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
limitations
of
his
civil
power
unless
as
he
said
measures
otherwise
unconstitutional
might
become
lawful
by
becoming
indispensable
to
the
preservation
of
the
constitution
through
the
preservation
of
the
nation
thus
when
in
frémont
in
missouri
proclaimed
emancipation
to
the
slaves
of
persistent
rebels
although
this
was
hailed
with
delight
by
vast
numbers
at
the
north
the
president
countermanded
it
as
not
yet
an
indispensable
necessity
in
march
he
approved
acts
of
congress
legalizing
general
butler
shrewd
device
of
declaring
all
slaves
of
rebels
in
arms
as
contraband
of
war
and
thus
when
they
came
within
the
army
lines
to
be
freed
and
used
by
the
northern
armies
in
march
may
and
july
he
made
earnest
appeals
to
the
border
states
to
favor
compensated
emancipation
because
he
foresaw
that
military
emancipation
would
become
necessary
before
long
when
lee
was
in
maryland
and
pennsylvania
he
felt
that
the
time
had
arrived
and
awaited
only
some
marked
military
success
so
that
the
measure
should
seem
a
mightier
blow
to
the
rebels
and
not
a
cry
for
help
and
this
was
a
necessary
condition
for
while
hundreds
of
thousands
of
democrats
had
joined
the
armies
and
had
become
republicans
for
the
war
in
fact
all
the
best
generals
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
soldiers
of
the
north
had
been
democrats
before
the
flag
was
fired
on
yet
the
democratic
politicians
of
the
proslavery
type
were
still
alive
and
active
throughout
the
north
doing
all
they
could
to
discredit
the
national
cause
and
hinder
the
government
and
lincoln
intuitively
knew
that
this
act
must
commend
itself
to
the
great
mass
of
the
northern
people
or
it
would
be
a
colossal
blunder
therefore
when
lee
had
been
driven
back
on
september
the
president
issued
a
preliminary
proclamation
stating
that
he
should
again
recommend
congress
to
favor
an
act
tendering
pecuniary
aid
to
slaveholders
in
states
not
in
rebellion
who
would
adopt
immediate
or
gradual
abolishment
of
slavery
within
their
limits
but
that
on
the
first
day
of
january
all
persons
held
as
slaves
within
any
state
or
designated
part
of
a
state
the
people
whereof
shall
be
in
rebellion
against
the
united
states
shall
be
thenceforward
and
forever
free
and
accordingly
in
spite
of
burnside
dreadful
disaster
before
fredericksburg
on
december
unfavorable
results
in
the
fall
elections
throughout
the
north
much
criticism
of
his
course
in
the
congress
and
the
unpopular
necessity
of
more
men
and
more
money
to
be
drawn
from
the
loyal
states
on
january
the
courageous
leader
sent
forth
his
final
and
peremptory
decree
of
emancipation
he
issued
it
by
virtue
of
the
power
in
me
vested
as
of
the
army
and
navy
of
the
united
states
in
time
of
actual
armed
rebellion
against
the
authority
and
government
of
the
united
states
and
as
a
fit
and
necessary
for
suppressing
said
rebellion
of
course
such
an
edict
would
have
no
immediate
force
in
the
remoter
states
controlled
by
the
confederate
government
nor
at
the
time
did
it
produce
any
remarkable
sensation
except
to
arouse
bitter
animadversion
at
the
north
and
renewed
desperation
of
effort
at
the
south
but
it
immediately
began
to
reduce
the
workers
on
intrenchments
and
fortifications
along
the
confederate
front
and
to
increase
those
of
the
federal
forces
while
soon
also
providing
actual
troops
for
the
union
armies
and
since
it
was
subsequently
indorsed
by
all
the
states
through
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
by
which
slavery
was
forever
prohibited
in
the
states
and
territories
of
the
united
states
and
in
view
of
its
immense
consequences
the
emancipation
proclamation
of
lincoln
must
be
regarded
as
perhaps
the
culminating
event
in
the
war
it
was
his
own
act
and
he
accepted
all
the
responsibilities
the
abolition
of
slavery
is
therefore
forever
identified
with
the
administration
of
lincoln
in
the
early
part
of
lincoln
relieved
burnside
of
his
command
and
appointed
general
joseph
hooker
to
succeed
him
this
officer
had
distinguished
himself
as
a
brilliant
tactician
he
was
known
as
fighting
joe
but
he
was
rash
he
made
a
bold
and
successful
march
crossed
the
rappahannock
and
rapidan
rivers
and
advanced
upon
the
enemy
but
early
in
may
was
defeated
at
chancellorsville
in
one
of
the
bloodiest
battles
of
the
war
the
confederates
were
now
exceedingly
elated
and
lee
with
a
largely
increased
army
of
ninety
thousand
splendid
fighting
men
resolved
on
invading
pennsylvania
in
force
evading
hooker
he
passed
through
the
shenandoah
valley
and
about
the
middle
of
june
was
in
pennsylvania
before
the
union
forces
could
be
gathered
to
oppose
him
he
took
york
and
carlisle
and
threatened
harrisburg
the
invasion
filled
the
north
with
dismay
hooker
feeling
his
incompetency
and
on
bad
terms
with
halleck
the
asked
to
be
relieved
and
his
request
was
at
once
granted
general
george
meade
was
appointed
his
successor
on
june
striking
due
north
with
all
speed
ably
supported
by
a
remarkable
group
of
and
the
veteran
army
of
the
potomac
handsomely
reinforced
and
keenly
eager
to
fight
meade
brought
lee
to
bay
near
the
village
of
gettysburg
and
after
three
days
of
terrific
fighting
in
which
the
losses
of
the
two
armies
aggregated
over
thousand
men
on
the
of
july
he
defeated
lee
army
and
turned
it
rapidly
southward
this
was
the
most
decisive
battle
of
the
war
and
the
most
bloody
finally
lost
by
lee
through
his
making
the
same
mistake
that
burnside
did
at
fredericksburg
in
attacking
equal
forces
intrenched
on
a
hill
nothing
was
left
to
lee
but
retreat
across
the
potomac
and
meade
an
able
but
not
a
great
captain
made
the
mistake
that
mcclellan
had
made
at
antietam
in
not
following
up
his
advantage
but
allowing
lee
to
escape
into
virginia
to
cap
the
climax
of
union
success
on
the
of
july
general
ulysses
grant
who
had
been
operating
against
vicksburg
on
the
mississippi
during
four
months
captured
that
city
with
thousand
prisoners
and
a
few
days
later
port
hudson
with
its
garrison
fell
into
his
hands
the
signal
combination
of
victories
filled
the
north
with
enthusiasm
and
the
president
with
profoundest
gratitude
it
is
true
meade
failure
to
follow
and
capture
lee
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
lincoln
the
confederate
commander
might
have
been
compelled
to
surrender
to
a
flushed
and
conquering
army
a
third
larger
than
his
own
had
meade
pursued
and
attacked
him
and
the
war
might
perhaps
virtually
have
ended
yet
lee
army
was
by
no
means
routed
and
was
in
dangerous
mood
while
meade
losses
had
been
really
larger
than
his
so
that
the
federal
general
caution
does
not
lack
military
defenders
nevertheless
he
evidently
was
not
the
man
that
had
been
sought
for
more
than
two
years
had
now
elapsed
since
the
army
of
the
potomac
had
been
organized
by
mcclellan
and
yet
it
was
no
nearer
the
end
which
the
president
the
war
minister
the
cabinet
and
the
generals
had
in
view
the
capture
of
richmond
thus
far
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
had
been
lost
in
the
contest
which
the
politicians
had
supposed
was
to
be
so
brief
not
a
single
general
had
arisen
at
the
east
equal
to
the
occasion
only
a
few
of
the
generals
had
seen
important
military
service
before
the
war
and
not
one
had
evinced
remarkable
abilities
although
many
had
distinguished
themselves
for
bravery
and
capacity
to
manage
well
an
army
corps
each
army
commander
had
failed
when
great
responsibilities
had
been
imposed
upon
him
not
one
came
up
to
popular
expectation
the
great
soldier
must
be
born
as
well
as
made
it
must
be
observed
that
up
to
this
time
in
the
autumn
of
the
president
had
not
only
superintended
the
army
of
the
potomac
but
had
borne
the
chief
burden
of
the
government
and
the
war
at
large
cabinet
meetings
reports
of
generals
quarrels
of
generals
dissensions
of
political
leaders
impertinence
of
editors
the
premature
pressure
to
emancipate
slaves
western
campaigns
the
affairs
of
the
navy
and
a
thousand
other
things
pressed
upon
his
attention
it
was
his
custom
to
follow
the
movements
of
every
army
with
the
map
before
him
and
to
be
perfectly
familiar
with
all
the
general
and
many
of
the
detailed
problems
in
every
part
of
the
vast
field
of
the
war
no
man
was
ever
more
overworked
it
may
be
a
question
how
far
he
was
wise
in
himself
attending
to
so
many
details
and
in
giving
directions
to
generals
in
high
command
and
sometimes
against
the
advice
of
men
more
experienced
in
military
matters
that
is
not
for
me
to
settle
he
seemed
to
bear
the
government
and
all
the
armies
on
head
and
heart
as
if
the
responsibility
for
everything
was
imposed
upon
him
what
had
been
the
history
in
the
east
two
years
clouded
by
disasters
mistakes
and
national
disappointments
with
at
last
a
breaking
of
the
day
and
that
in
the
west
was
ever
a
man
more
severely
tried
and
yet
in
view
of
fatal
errors
on
the
part
of
generals
the
disobedience
of
orders
and
the
unfriendly
detractions
of
chase
his
able
but
secretary
of
the
treasury
not
a
word
of
reproach
had
fallen
from
him
he
was
still
gentle
conciliatory
patient
forgiving
on
all
occasions
and
marvellously
reticent
and
his
transcendent
moral
qualities
stood
out
before
the
world
unquestioned
whatever
criticisms
may
be
made
as
to
the
wisdom
of
all
his
acts
but
a
brighter
day
was
at
hand
the
disasters
of
the
east
for
gettysburg
was
but
the
retrieving
of
a
desperate
situation
were
compensated
by
great
success
in
the
west
fort
donelson
and
columbus
in
vicksburg
and
port
hudson
in
had
been
great
achievements
the
mississippi
was
cleared
of
hostile
forts
upon
its
banks
and
was
opened
to
its
mouth
new
orleans
was
occupied
by
union
troops
the
finances
were
in
good
condition
for
chase
had
managed
that
great
problem
with
brilliant
effect
the
national
credit
was
restored
the
navy
had
done
wonders
and
the
southern
coast
was
effectually
blockaded
a
war
with
england
had
been
averted
by
the
tact
of
lincoln
rather
than
the
diplomacy
of
seward
lincoln
cordially
sustained
in
his
messages
to
congress
the
financial
schemes
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
while
he
carefully
watched
he
did
not
interfere
with
the
orders
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
to
farragut
foote
and
porter
was
great
glory
due
for
opening
the
mississippi
as
much
as
to
grant
and
sherman
for
cutting
the
confederate
states
in
twain
too
much
praise
can
not
be
given
to
chase
for
the
restoration
of
the
national
credit
and
lincoln
bore
patiently
his
adverse
criticism
in
view
of
his
transcendent
services
at
this
stage
of
public
affairs
in
the
latter
part
of
general
grant
was
called
from
the
west
to
take
command
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
his
great
military
abilities
were
known
to
the
whole
nation
although
a
graduate
of
west
point
who
had
when
young
done
good
service
under
general
scott
his
mature
life
had
been
a
failure
and
when
the
war
broke
out
he
was
engaged
in
the
tanning
business
at
galena
illinois
at
a
salary
of
he
offered
his
services
to
the
governor
of
illinois
and
was
made
a
colonel
of
volunteers
shortly
after
entering
active
service
he
was
made
and
his
ability
as
a
commander
was
soon
apparent
he
gradually
rose
to
the
command
of
the
military
district
of
southeast
missouri
then
to
the
command
of
the
great
military
rendezvous
and
depot
at
cairo
then
followed
his
expedition
assisted
by
commodore
foote
against
fort
henry
on
the
tennessee
river
in
the
early
part
of
with
no
encouragement
from
halleck
the
at
louis
the
capture
of
fort
donelson
on
the
cumberland
river
came
next
to
the
amazement
and
chagrin
of
the
confederate
generals
for
which
he
was
made
a
of
volunteers
this
was
a
great
service
which
resulted
in
the
surrender
of
generals
buckner
and
johnston
with
confederate
soldiers
stands
of
arms
pieces
of
artillery
and
horses
but
this
great
success
was
nothing
to
the
siege
and
capture
of
vicksburg
july
which
opened
the
mississippi
and
divided
the
confederacy
to
say
nothing
of
the
surrender
of
nearly
men
cannon
and
muskets
then
followed
the
great
battle
of
chattanooga
which
shed
glory
on
thomas
sherman
burnside
and
hooker
and
raised
still
higher
the
military
fame
of
grant
who
had
planned
and
directed
it
no
general
in
the
war
had
approached
him
in
success
and
ability
the
eyes
of
the
nation
were
now
upon
him
congress
revived
for
him
the
grade
of
and
the
conqueror
of
vicksburg
and
chattanooga
received
the
honor
on
march
the
first
on
whom
the
full
rank
had
been
conferred
since
washington
the
conferred
on
winfield
scott
after
the
mexican
war
was
a
special
brevet
title
of
honor
that
rank
not
existing
in
our
army
on
the
of
march
the
president
met
the
successful
and
fortunate
general
for
the
first
time
and
was
delighted
with
his
quiet
modesty
on
the
next
day
he
gave
him
command
of
all
the
armies
of
the
united
states
grant
was
given
to
understand
that
the
work
assigned
to
him
personally
was
the
capture
of
richmond
but
he
was
left
to
follow
out
his
own
plans
and
march
to
the
confederate
capital
by
any
route
he
saw
fit
henceforth
the
president
feeling
full
confidence
ceased
to
concern
himself
with
the
plans
of
the
general
commanding
the
army
of
the
potomac
he
did
not
even
ask
to
know
them
all
he
and
the
secretary
of
war
could
do
was
to
forward
the
plans
of
the
and
provide
all
the
troops
he
wanted
lincoln
anxieties
of
course
remained
and
he
watched
eagerly
for
news
and
was
seen
often
at
the
war
department
till
late
at
night
waiting
to
learn
what
grant
was
doing
but
grant
was
left
with
the
whole
military
responsibility
because
he
was
evidently
competent
for
it
the
relief
to
lincoln
must
have
been
immense
the
history
of
the
war
from
this
time
belongs
to
the
life
of
grant
rather
than
of
lincoln
suggestions
to
that
successful
soldier
from
civilians
now
were
like
those
of
the
dutch
deputies
when
they
undertook
to
lecture
the
great
marlborough
on
the
art
of
war
to
bring
the
war
to
a
speedy
close
required
the
brain
and
the
will
and
the
energy
of
a
military
genius
and
the
rapid
and
concentrated
efforts
of
veteran
soldiers
disciplined
by
experience
and
inured
to
the
toils
and
dangers
of
war
the
only
great
obstacle
was
the
difficulty
of
enlisting
men
in
what
was
now
more
than
ever
to
be
dangerous
work
when
grant
began
his
march
to
richmond
probably
of
soldiers
had
perished
on
each
side
and
a
national
debt
had
been
contracted
of
over
two
thousand
millions
of
dollars
in
spite
of
patriotic
calls
in
spite
of
bounties
it
became
necessary
to
draft
men
into
the
service
a
compulsory
act
of
power
to
be
justified
only
by
the
exigencies
of
the
country
in
no
other
way
could
the
requisite
number
of
troops
be
secured
multitudes
of
the
survivors
have
been
subsequently
rewarded
at
least
partially
by
pensions
the
pension
list
at
the
close
of
harrison
administration
in
amounted
to
a
sum
greater
than
germany
annually
expends
on
its
gigantic
army
so
far
as
the
pensioners
are
genuinely
disabled
veterans
the
people
make
no
complaint
appreciating
the
sacrifices
which
the
soldiers
were
compelled
to
make
in
the
dreadful
contest
but
so
vast
a
fund
for
distribution
attracted
the
inevitable
horde
of
small
lawyers
and
pension
agents
who
swelled
the
lists
with
multitudes
of
sham
veterans
and
cripples
until
many
eminent
cried
out
for
a
purgation
of
that
which
should
be
a
list
of
honor
nor
is
it
disloyal
or
unpatriotic
to
shed
a
tear
for
the
brave
but
misguided
men
whom
the
southern
leaders
led
to
destruction
without
any
such
recompense
for
their
wounds
and
hardships
for
the
loss
of
their
property
loss
of
military
prestige
loss
of
political
power
loss
of
everything
but
honor
at
first
we
called
them
rebels
and
no
penalties
were
deemed
too
severe
for
them
to
suffer
but
later
we
called
them
confederates
waging
war
for
a
cause
which
they
honestly
deemed
sacred
and
for
which
they
cheerfully
offered
up
their
lives
a
monstrous
delusion
indeed
but
one
for
which
we
ceased
to
curse
them
and
soon
learned
to
forgive
after
their
cause
was
lost
resentment
gave
place
to
pity
and
they
became
like
erring
brothers
whom
it
was
our
duty
to
forgive
and
in
many
respects
our
impulse
to
admire
not
for
their
cause
but
for
their
devotion
to
it
all
this
was
foreseen
and
foretold
by
edward
everett
during
the
war
yet
there
were
but
few
who
agreed
with
him
i
can
devote
but
little
space
to
the
military
movements
of
general
grant
in
virginia
until
richmond
surrendered
and
the
rebellion
collapsed
there
was
among
the
southerners
no
contempt
of
this
leader
fresh
from
the
laurels
of
fort
donelson
vicksburg
and
chattanooga
and
the
confederates
put
forth
almost
superhuman
efforts
to
defend
their
capital
against
the
scientific
strategy
of
the
most
successful
general
of
the
war
supported
as
he
was
by
almost
unlimited
forces
and
the
unreserved
confidence
of
his
government
the
new
established
his
headquarters
at
culpeper
court
house
near
the
end
of
march
his
plan
of
operations
was
simple
to
advance
against
lee
before
proceeding
to
richmond
and
defeat
his
army
if
possible
richmond
even
if
taken
would
be
comparatively
valueless
unless
lee
were
previously
defeated
forces
were
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
and
lee
little
more
than
half
that
number
but
the
latter
were
intrenched
in
strong
positions
on
the
interior
line
it
was
grant
plan
to
fight
whenever
an
opportunity
was
presented
since
he
could
afford
to
lose
two
men
to
one
of
the
enemy
and
was
thus
sure
to
beat
in
the
long
run
as
a
having
a
superiority
of
pieces
freely
exchanges
as
he
gets
opportunity
there
was
nothing
particularly
brilliant
in
this
policy
adopted
by
grant
except
the
great
fact
that
he
chose
the
course
most
likely
to
succeed
whatever
might
be
his
losses
lee
at
first
was
also
ready
to
fight
but
after
the
dreadful
slaughter
on
both
sides
in
the
battles
of
the
wilderness
spottsylvania
and
cold
harbor
he
apparently
changed
his
plans
of
his
forces
had
melted
away
he
saw
that
he
could
not
afford
to
take
risks
and
retreated
behind
his
defences
grant
too
had
changed
his
operations
at
first
directed
against
richmond
on
the
northwest
and
since
he
found
every
hill
and
wood
and
morass
strongly
fortified
he
concluded
to
march
on
lee
flank
to
the
james
river
and
attack
richmond
from
the
south
after
reducing
petersburg
and
destroying
the
southern
railroads
by
which
the
confederates
received
most
of
their
supplies
the
federal
commander
had
all
the
men
he
wanted
a
large
force
was
under
butler
near
petersburg
and
sheridan
had
driven
out
the
enemy
from
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
with
his
magnificent
cavalry
lee
was
now
cooped
up
between
fredericksburg
and
richmond
he
was
too
great
a
general
to
lead
his
army
into
either
of
these
strongholds
where
they
might
be
taken
as
pemberton
army
was
at
vicksburg
he
wisely
kept
the
field
although
he
would
not
fight
except
behind
his
intrenchments
when
he
was
absolutely
forced
by
the
aggressive
foe
henceforth
from
june
to
the
close
of
the
war
the
operations
of
grant
resembled
a
siege
rather
than
a
series
of
battles
he
had
lost
over
fifty
thousand
men
thus
far
in
his
march
and
he
too
now
became
economical
of
his
soldiers
blood
he
complained
not
but
doggedly
carried
out
his
plans
without
consulting
the
government
at
washington
or
his
own
generals
his
work
was
hard
and
discouraging
he
had
to
fight
his
way
step
by
step
against
strong
intrenchments
the
only
thing
to
do
but
he
had
the
will
and
patience
to
do
it
he
had
ordered
an
attack
on
petersburg
which
must
be
reduced
before
he
could
advance
to
richmond
but
the
attack
had
failed
and
he
now
sat
down
to
a
regular
siege
of
that
strong
and
important
position
the
siege
lasted
ten
months
when
lee
was
driven
within
his
inner
line
of
defences
and
seeing
that
all
was
lost
on
april
evacuated
his
position
and
began
his
retreat
to
the
west
hoping
to
reach
lynchburg
and
after
that
effect
a
junction
with
johnston
coming
up
from
the
south
but
his
retreat
was
cut
off
near
appomattox
and
being
entirely
surrounded
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
surrender
to
grant
with
his
entire
army
april
with
his
surrender
richmond
of
course
fell
and
the
war
was
virtually
closed
out
of
the
men
who
had
enlisted
on
the
union
side
were
killed
or
mortally
wounded
and
died
from
other
causes
the
expense
of
the
war
was
the
losses
of
the
confederates
were
about
as
much
of
the
millions
who
had
enlisted
on
both
sides
nearly
a
million
of
men
perished
and
over
five
thousand
millions
of
dollars
were
expended
probably
a
quarter
of
the
whole
capital
of
the
country
at
that
time
so
great
were
the
sacrifices
made
to
preserve
the
union
at
the
cost
of
more
blood
and
treasure
than
have
been
spent
in
any
other
war
in
modern
times
i
am
compelled
to
omit
notices
of
military
movements
in
other
parts
of
the
union
especially
in
the
west
where
some
of
the
most
gallant
actions
of
the
war
took
place
the
brilliant
strategy
of
rosecrans
the
signal
achievements
of
thomas
sherman
march
to
the
sea
raids
the
naval
exploits
of
farragut
porter
and
foote
and
other
acts
of
heroism
as
not
bearing
directly
on
the
life
of
lincoln
of
course
he
felt
the
intensest
interest
in
all
the
military
operations
and
bore
an
unceasing
burden
of
study
and
of
anxiety
which
of
itself
was
a
great
strain
on
all
his
powers
if
anything
had
gone
wrong
which
he
could
remedy
his
voice
and
his
hand
would
have
been
heard
and
seen
but
toward
the
last
other
things
demanded
his
personal
attention
and
these
were
of
great
importance
there
never
had
been
a
time
since
his
inauguration
when
he
was
free
from
embarrassments
and
when
his
burdens
had
not
been
oppressive
among
other
things
the
misunderstanding
between
him
and
secretary
chase
was
anything
but
pleasant
chase
had
proved
himself
the
ablest
finance
minister
that
this
country
had
produced
after
alexander
hamilton
he
was
a
man
of
remarkable
dignity
integrity
and
patriotism
he
was
not
vain
but
he
was
conscious
both
of
his
services
and
his
abilities
and
he
was
always
inclined
to
underrate
lincoln
whom
he
misunderstood
he
also
had
presidential
aspirations
after
three
successful
service
he
did
not
like
to
have
his
suggestions
disregarded
and
was
impatient
under
any
interference
with
his
appointments
to
say
the
least
his
relations
with
the
president
were
strained
annoyed
and
vexed
with
some
appointments
of
importance
he
sent
in
his
resignation
accompanied
with
a
petulant
letter
lincoln
on
its
receipt
drove
to
the
secretary
house
handed
back
to
him
his
letter
and
persuaded
him
to
reconsider
his
resignation
but
it
is
difficult
to
mend
a
broken
jar
the
same
trouble
soon
again
occurred
in
reference
to
the
appointment
in
new
york
of
an
by
chase
which
the
president
having
no
confidence
in
the
appointee
could
not
accept
on
which
the
secretary
again
resigned
and
lincoln
at
once
accepted
his
resignation
with
these
words
of
all
i
have
said
in
commendation
of
your
ability
and
fidelity
i
have
nothing
to
unsay
and
yet
you
and
i
have
reached
a
point
of
mutual
embarrassment
in
our
official
relations
which
it
seems
can
not
be
overcome
or
longer
sustained
consistently
with
the
public
service
chase
however
did
not
long
remain
unemployed
on
the
death
of
chief
justice
taney
in
october
lincoln
appointed
him
to
the
head
of
the
supreme
court
showing
how
little
he
cherished
resentment
and
how
desirous
he
was
to
select
the
best
men
for
all
responsible
positions
whether
he
personally
liked
them
or
not
even
when
an
able
man
had
failed
in
one
place
lincoln
generally
found
use
for
his
services
in
another
witness
the
gallant
exploits
of
burnside
hooker
and
meade
after
they
had
retired
from
the
head
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
as
a
successor
to
chase
in
the
treasury
the
president
to
the
amazement
of
the
country
selected
governor
tod
of
ohio
who
wisely
declined
the
office
the
next
choice
fell
on
senator
wm
pitt
fessenden
who
reluctantly
assumed
an
office
which
entailed
such
heavy
responsibilities
and
hard
work
but
who
made
in
it
a
fine
record
for
efficiency
it
was
no
slight
thing
to
be
obliged
to
raise
one
hundred
millions
of
dollars
every
month
for
the
expense
of
the
war
while
general
grant
lay
apparently
idle
in
his
trenches
before
petersburg
the
presidential
election
of
took
place
and
in
spite
of
the
unpopular
draft
of
five
hundred
thousand
men
in
july
and
a
summer
and
autumn
of
severe
fighting
both
east
and
west
lincoln
was
elected
there
had
been
active
and
even
acrimonious
opposition
but
who
could
compete
with
him
at
this
time
his
extraordinary
fitness
for
the
highest
office
in
the
gift
of
the
nation
was
generally
acknowledged
and
the
early
prejudices
against
him
had
mostly
passed
away
he
neither
sought
nor
declined
the
his
second
inaugural
address
has
become
historical
for
its
lofty
sentiments
and
political
wisdom
it
was
universally
admired
and
his
memorable
words
sunk
into
every
true
american
heart
said
he
fondly
do
we
hope
fervently
do
we
pray
that
this
mighty
scourge
of
war
may
soon
pass
away
yet
if
god
wills
that
it
continue
until
all
the
wealth
piled
by
the
bondsman
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
of
unrequited
toil
shall
be
sunk
and
until
every
drop
of
blood
drawn
by
the
lash
shall
be
paid
with
another
drawn
by
the
sword
as
was
said
three
thousand
years
ago
so
still
it
must
be
said
judgments
of
the
lord
are
true
and
righteous
altogether
and
as
showing
his
earnest
conscientiousness
these
familiar
words
with
malice
toward
none
with
charity
for
all
with
firmness
in
the
right
as
god
gives
us
to
see
the
right
let
us
strive
on
to
finish
the
work
we
are
in
to
bind
up
the
nation
wounds
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle
and
for
his
widow
and
orphans
to
do
all
which
may
achieve
and
cherish
a
just
and
lasting
peace
among
ourselves
and
with
all
nations
the
eloquence
of
this
is
surpassed
only
by
his
own
short
speech
at
the
dedication
of
the
national
cemetery
at
gettysburg
november
which
threw
into
the
shade
the
rhetoric
of
the
greatest
orator
of
his
time
and
stands
unstudied
as
it
was
probably
the
most
complete
and
effective
utterance
known
in
this
century
that
immortal
inaugural
address
in
march
so
simple
and
yet
so
eloquent
expresses
two
things
in
lincoln
character
to
be
especially
noted
first
the
tenderness
and
compassion
blended
with
stern
energy
and
iron
firmness
of
will
which
shrank
from
bloodshed
and
violence
yet
counted
any
sacrifice
of
blood
and
treasure
as
of
little
account
in
comparison
with
the
transcendent
blessing
of
national
union
and
liberty
and
secondly
the
change
which
it
would
appear
gradually
took
place
in
his
mind
in
reference
to
divine
supervision
in
the
affairs
of
men
and
nations
i
need
not
dwell
on
the
first
since
nothing
is
more
unquestionable
than
his
abhorrence
of
all
unnecessary
bloodshed
or
of
anything
like
vengeance
or
punishment
of
enemies
whether
personal
or
political
his
leniency
and
forgiveness
were
so
great
as
to
be
denounced
by
some
of
his
best
friends
and
by
all
political
fanatics
and
this
leniency
and
forgiveness
were
the
more
remarkable
since
he
was
not
demonstrative
in
his
affections
and
friendships
from
his
judicial
temper
and
the
ascendency
of
his
intellectual
faculties
over
passion
and
interest
he
was
apparently
cold
in
his
nature
and
impassive
in
view
of
all
passing
events
to
such
a
degree
that
his
humanity
seemed
to
be
based
on
a
philosophy
very
much
akin
to
that
of
marcus
aurelius
his
sympathies
were
keen
however
and
many
a
distressed
woman
had
cause
for
gratitude
to
him
for
interference
with
the
stern
processes
of
army
discipline
in
time
of
war
much
to
the
indignation
of
the
civil
or
military
martinets
in
regard
to
the
change
in
his
religious
views
this
fact
is
more
questionable
but
attested
by
all
who
knew
him
and
by
most
of
his
biographers
as
a
lawyer
in
springfield
his
religious
views
according
to
his
partner
and
biographer
herndon
were
extremely
liberal
verging
upon
those
advanced
theories
which
volney
and
thomas
paine
advocated
even
upon
atheism
itself
as
he
grew
older
he
became
more
discreet
as
to
the
expression
of
his
religious
opinions
judge
davis
who
knew
him
well
affirms
that
he
had
no
faith
in
the
christian
sense
but
only
in
laws
principles
cause
and
effect
that
is
he
had
no
belief
in
a
personal
god
no
religion
seemed
to
find
favor
with
him
except
that
of
a
practical
and
rationalistic
order
he
never
joined
a
church
and
was
sceptical
of
the
divine
origin
of
the
bible
still
more
of
what
is
called
providential
agency
in
this
world
but
when
the
tremendous
responsibilities
of
his
office
began
to
press
upon
his
mind
and
the
terrible
calamities
he
deplored
but
could
not
avert
stirred
up
his
soul
in
anguish
and
sadness
then
the
recognition
of
the
need
of
assistance
higher
than
that
of
man
for
the
guidance
of
this
great
nation
in
its
unparalleled
trials
became
apparent
in
all
his
utterances
when
he
said
as
god
gives
us
to
see
the
right
he
meant
if
he
meant
anything
that
wisdom
to
act
in
trying
circumstances
is
a
gift
distinct
from
what
is
ordinarily
learned
from
experience
or
study
this
gift
we
believe
he
earnestly
sought
it
must
have
been
a
profound
satisfaction
to
lincoln
that
he
lived
to
see
the
total
collapse
of
the
rebellion
the
fall
of
richmond
the
surrender
of
lee
and
the
flight
of
jefferson
davis
the
complete
triumph
of
the
cause
which
it
was
intrusted
to
him
to
guard
how
happy
he
must
have
been
to
see
that
the
choice
he
made
of
a
in
the
person
of
ulysses
grant
had
brought
the
war
to
a
successful
close
whatever
the
sacrifices
which
this
great
general
found
it
necessary
to
make
to
win
ultimate
success
what
a
wonder
it
is
that
lincoln
surrounded
with
so
many
dangers
and
so
many
enemies
should
have
lived
to
see
the
completion
of
the
work
for
which
he
was
raised
up
no
life
of
ease
or
luxury
or
exultation
did
he
lead
after
he
was
inaugurated
having
not
even
time
to
visit
the
places
where
his
earlier
life
was
passed
for
him
there
were
no
triumphal
visits
to
new
york
and
boston
no
great
ovations
anywhere
his
great
office
brought
him
only
hard
and
unceasing
toil
which
taxed
all
his
energies
it
was
while
seeking
a
momentary
relaxation
from
his
cares
and
duties
but
a
few
weeks
after
his
second
inauguration
that
he
met
his
fate
at
the
hands
of
the
assassin
from
peril
of
whose
murderous
designs
no
great
actor
on
the
scene
of
mortal
strife
and
labor
can
be
said
to
be
free
all
that
a
grateful
and
sorrowing
nation
could
do
was
done
in
honor
of
his
services
and
character
his
remains
were
carried
across
the
land
to
their
last
in
illinois
through
our
largest
cities
with
a
funeral
pageantry
unexampled
in
the
history
of
nations
and
ever
since
orators
have
exhausted
language
in
their
encomiums
of
his
greatness
and
glory
some
think
that
lincoln
died
fortunately
for
his
fame
that
had
he
lived
he
might
have
made
mistakes
especially
in
the
work
of
reconstruction
which
would
have
seriously
affected
his
claim
as
a
great
national
benefactor
on
the
other
hand
had
he
lived
he
might
have
put
the
work
of
reconstruction
on
a
basis
which
would
have
added
to
his
great
services
to
the
country
the
south
had
no
better
friend
than
he
and
he
was
incapable
of
animosity
or
revenge
certain
it
is
that
this
work
of
reconstruction
requires
even
yet
the
greatest
patriotism
and
a
marvellous
political
wisdom
the
terrible
fact
that
five
millions
of
free
negroes
are
yet
doomed
to
ignorance
while
even
the
more
intelligent
and
industrious
have
failed
to
realize
the
ideals
of
citizenship
makes
the
negro
question
still
one
of
paramount
importance
in
the
south
the
great
question
whether
they
shall
enjoy
the
right
of
suffrage
seems
to
be
disposed
of
for
the
present
but
the
greater
problem
of
their
education
must
be
solved
the
subject
is
receiving
most
serious
consideration
and
encouraging
progress
is
already
making
in
the
direction
of
their
general
and
industrial
training
but
they
are
fast
increasing
their
labor
is
a
necessity
and
they
must
be
educated
to
citizenship
both
in
mind
and
in
morals
or
the
fairest
portion
of
our
country
will
find
their
presence
a
continuous
menace
to
peace
and
prosperity
these
questions
it
was
not
given
to
lincoln
to
consider
he
died
prematurely
as
a
martyr
nothing
consecrates
a
human
memory
like
martyrdom
nothing
so
effectually
ends
all
jealousies
animosities
and
prejudices
as
the
assassin
dagger
if
caesar
had
not
been
assassinated
it
is
doubtful
if
even
he
the
greatest
man
of
all
antiquity
could
have
bequeathed
universal
empire
to
his
heirs
lincoln
death
unnerved
the
strongest
mind
and
touched
the
heart
of
the
nation
with
undissembled
sadness
and
pity
from
that
time
no
one
has
dared
to
write
anything
derogatory
to
his
greatness
that
he
was
a
very
great
man
no
one
now
questions
it
is
impossible
however
for
any
one
yet
to
set
him
in
the
historical
place
which
as
an
immortal
benefactor
he
is
destined
to
occupy
all
speculation
as
to
his
comparative
rank
is
worse
than
useless
time
effects
wonderful
changes
in
human
opinions
there
are
some
people
in
these
days
who
affect
to
regard
washington
as
commonplace
as
the
lawyers
of
edinburgh
at
one
time
regarded
sir
walter
scott
because
he
made
no
effort
to
be
brilliant
in
speeches
there
are
others
who
in
the
warmth
of
their
innocent
enthusiasm
think
that
lincoln
fame
will
go
on
increasing
until
in
the
whole
eastern
world
among
the
mountains
of
thibet
on
the
shores
of
china
and
japan
among
the
jungles
of
india
in
the
wilds
of
darkest
africa
in
the
furthermost
islands
of
the
sea
his
praises
will
be
sung
as
second
to
no
political
benefactor
that
the
world
has
seen
as
all
exaggerations
provoke
antagonism
it
is
wisest
not
to
compare
him
with
any
national
idols
but
leave
him
to
the
undisputed
verdict
of
the
best
judges
that
lie
was
one
of
the
few
immortals
who
will
live
in
a
nation
heart
and
the
esteem
from
age
to
age
is
this
not
fame
enough
for
a
modest
man
who
felt
his
inferiority
in
many
respects
to
those
to
whom
he
himself
intrusted
power
lincoln
character
is
difficult
to
read
from
its
aspects
he
rarely
revealed
to
the
same
person
more
than
a
single
side
his
individuality
was
marvellous
let
us
take
him
in
the
words
of
his
latest
good
biographer
as
simply
abraham
lincoln
singular
and
solitary
as
we
all
see
that
he
was
let
us
be
thankful
if
we
can
make
a
niche
big
enough
for
him
among
the
world
heroes
without
worrying
ourselves
about
the
proportion
it
may
bear
to
other
niches
and
there
let
him
remain
forever
lonely
as
in
his
strong
lifetime
impressive
mysterious
unmeasured
and
unsolved
one
thing
may
be
confidently
affirmed
of
this
man
that
he
stands
as
a
notable
exemplar
in
the
highest
grade
of
the
american
of
this
century
the
natural
development
of
the
english
stock
upon
our
continent
lowell
in
his
commemoration
ode
has
set
forth
lincoln
greatness
and
this
fine
representative
quality
of
his
in
words
that
may
well
conclude
our
study
of
the
man
and
of
the
first
full
epoch
of
american
life
here
was
a
type
of
the
true
elder
race
and
one
of
plutarch
men
talked
with
us
face
to
face
i
praise
him
not
it
were
too
late
and
some
innative
weakness
there
must
be
in
him
who
condescends
to
victory
such
as
the
present
gives
and
can
not
wait
safe
in
himself
as
in
a
fate
so
always
firmly
he
he
knew
to
bide
his
time
and
can
his
fame
abide
still
patient
in
his
simple
faith
sublime
till
the
wise
years
decide
great
captains
with
their
guns
and
drums
disturb
our
judgment
for
the
hour
but
at
last
silence
comes
these
all
are
gone
and
standing
like
a
tower
our
children
shall
behold
his
fame
the
kindly
earnest
brave
foreseeing
man
sagacious
patient
dreading
praise
not
blame
new

our
new

the

authorities
the
most
voluminous
of
the
lives
of
abraham
lincoln
is
that
of
nicolay
and
hay
which
seems
to
be
fair
and
candid
without
great
exaggerations
but
it
is
more
a
political
and
military
history
of
the

than
a

perhaps
a

who
was
the

of
robert

robert

was
born
on
in
westmoreland
county
the
same
county
that
gave
to
the
world
george
washington
and
james
monroe
though
he
was
fatherless
at
eleven
the
father
blood
in
him
inclined
him
to
the
profession
of
arms
and
when
eighteen
in
on
an
appointment
obtained
for
him
by
general
andrew

he
entered

graduated
in

was
at

till

attained
only
a
captaincy
this
was
conferred
on
him
in

blessed
by
seven
children
was
in
all
respects
most
happy
in
his
prime
lee
was
spoken
of
as
the
handsomest
man
in

he
was
about
six
feet
tall

built

fond
of

enthusiastic
in

profession
gentle
dignified
studious
and
positively
though
unobtrusively
religious
if
he
had
faults
which
those
nearest
him
doubted
they
were
excess
of
modesty
and
excess
of
tenderness
during
the
mexican
war
captain
lee
directed
all
the
most
important
engineering
operations
of
the
american
army
a
work
vital
to
its
wonderful
success
already
at
the
siege
of
vera
cruz
general
scott
mentioned
him
as
having
greatly
distinguished
himself
he
was
prominent
in
all
the
operations
thence
to
cerro
gordo
where
in
april
he
was
brevetted
major
both
at
contreras
and
at
churubusco
he
was
credited
with
gallant
and
meritorious
services
at
the
charge
up
chapultepec
in
which
joseph
johnston
george
mcclellan
george
pickett
and
thomas

participated
lee
bore
scott
orders
to
all
points
until
from
loss
of
blood
by
a
wound
and
from
the
loss
of
two
nights
sleep
at
the
batteries
he
actually
fainted
away
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
such
ability
and
devotion
brought
him
home
from
mexico
bearing
the
brevet
rank
of
colonel

had
learned
to
think
of
him
as
the
greatest

promising
candidate
for

position
whenever
that
venerable
hero
vacated
it
as
he
was
sure
to
do
soon
on
the
initiative
of
mississippi
a
provisional
congress
had
met
at
montgomery
on
and
created
a
provisional
constitution
for
the
confederate
states
of

by
march
a
permanent
constitution
was
drafted
reproducing
that
of
the
united

with
certain
modifications
slavery
and
received
elaborate
guarantees

was
a
virginian
and
virginia
about
to
secede
and
at
length
seceding
in
most
earnest
tones
besought
her
distinguished
son
to
join
her
it
seemed
to
him
the
call
of
duty
and
that
call
as
he
understood
it
was
one
which
it
was
not
in
him
to
disobey
president
lincoln
knew
the
value
of
the
man
and
sent
frank
blair
to
him
to
say
that
if
he
would
abide
by
the
union
he
should
soon
command
the
whole
active
army
that
would
probably
have
meant
his
election
in
due
time
to
the
presidency
of
his
country
for
god
sake
do
resign
lee
general
scott
himself
a
virginian
is
said
to
have
pleaded
he
replied
i
am
compelled
to
i
can
not
consult
my
own
feelings
in
the
matter
accordingly
on
april
three
days
after
virginia
passed
its
ordinance
of
secession
lee
sent
to
simon
cameron
secretary
of
war
his
resignation
as
an
officer
in
the
united
states
army
few
at
the
north
were
able
to
understand
the
secession
movement
most
denying
that
a
man
at
once
thoughtful
and
honorable
could
join
in
it
so
centralized
had
the
north
by
become
in
all
social
and
economic
particulars
that
centrality
in
government
was
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
representing
this
the
nation
was
deemed
paramount
to
any
state
governmental
sovereignty
like
travel
and
trade
had
come
to
ignore
state
lines
the
whole
idea
and
feeling
of
once
as
potent
north
as
south
had
vanished
and
been
forgotten
far
otherwise
at
the
south
where
owing
to
the
great
size
of
states
and
to
the
paucity
of
railways
and
telegraphs
interstate
association
was
not
yet
a
force
each
state
being
in
square
miles
ample
enough
for
an
empire
retained
to
a
great
extent
the
consciousness
of
an
independent
nation
the
state
was
near
and
palpable
the
central
government
seemed
a
vague
and
distant
thing
loyalty
was
conceived
as
binding
one
primarily
to
one
own
state
it
is
a
misconception
to
explain
this
feeling
for
in
most
cases
it
was
feeling
rather
than
reasoned
conviction
by
calhoun
teaching
it
resulted
from
geography
and
history
and
these
factors
working
as
they
did
would
have
been
what
it
was
had
calhoun
never
lived
with
reflecting
southerners
calhoun
message
no
doubt
had
some
confirmatory
effect
because
historically
and
also
in
a
certain
legal
aspect
calhoun
view
was
very
impressive
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
early
americans
who
voted
to
ratify
the
national
constitution
supposed
it
to
be
simply
a
compact
between
the
states
can
not
be
questioned
nor
could
ratification
ever
have
been
effected
had
any
considerable
number
believed
otherwise
the
view
that
a
state
wishing
to
withdraw
from
the
union
might
for
good
cause
do
so
was
the
prevalent
one
till
long
after
the
war
of
yielding
thereafter
at
the
north
less
to
webster
logic
than
to
the
social
and
economic
development
just
mentioned
at
the
south
it
did
not
thus
give
way
there
the
propriety
of
secession
was
never
aught
but
a
question
of
sufficient
grievance
to
be
settled
by
each
state
for
itself
speaking
through
a
majority
of
its
voters
when
the
secession
ordinances
actually
passed
many
individual
voters
in
each
state
opposed
on
the
ground
that
the
occasion
was
insufficient
but
such
opponents
of
whom
alexander
stephens
of
georgia
was
one
nearly
to
a
man
felt
bound
as
good
citizens
to
acquiesce
in
the
decision
of
their
states
and
even
to
uphold
this
in
arms
whether
voting
secession
or
accepting
it
on
state
mandate
southern
men
naturally
resented
being
called
traitors
or
rebels
by
the
websterian
conception
of
the
nature
of
our
government
they
were
so
but
by
calhoun
they
were
simply
acting
out
the
constitution
in
the
best
of
faith
no
recognized
arbiter
or
criterion
existed
to
determine
between
the
two
views
massachusetts
denounced
seceding
south
carolina
as
a
traitor
south
carolina
berated
massachusetts
seeking
to
impose
the
union
on
the
south
against
its
will
as
a
criminal
aggressor
an
intelligent
referee
with
no
bias
for
either
must
have
pronounced
the
judgments
equally
just
these
considerations
explain
how
colonel
lee
certainly
one
of
the
most
conscientious
men
who
ever
lived
felt
bound
in
duty
and
honor
to
side
with
seceding
virginia
though
he
doubted
the
wisdom
of
her
course
lee
was
from
the
first
virginia
military
hero
and
hope
but
he
did
not
at
once
become
such
to
the
confederacy
at
large
he
did
not
immediately
take
the
field
till
after
bull
run
he
remained
in
richmond
president
jefferson
davis
adviser
and
right
hand
man
in
organizing
the
forces
incessantly
arriving
and
pushing
to
the
front
in
his
brief
west
virginia
campaign
where
he
first
came
in
contact
with
mcclellan
being
looked
upon
as
an
invader
rather
than
a
friend
lee
had
scant
success
some
therefore
called
him
a
mere
historic
name
letcher
pet
a
west
pointer
no
fighting
general
he
went
to
south
carolina
to
supervise
the
repair
and
building
of
coast
fortifications
there
and
it
was
no
doubt
in
large
part
owing
to
his
engineering
skill
then
applied
that
charleston
whose
the
federals
incessantly
pounded
from
the
beginning
probably
wasting
there
more
powder
and
iron
than
at
all
other
points
together
was
captured
only
at
the
end
of
the
war
and
then
from
the
land
side
in
march
general
lee
again
became
president
davis
military
adviser
but
though
thus
in
relative
obscurity
lee
was
not
forgotten
president
davis
knew
his
man
and
knew
that
his
hour
would
come
when
in
may
the
vast
federal
army
stood
almost
at
richmond
gates
albert
sidney
johnston
being
dead
and
joseph
johnston
lying
wounded
the
confederacy
lifted
up
its
voice
and
called
robert
lee
to
assume
command
upon
the
chickahominy
front
this
he
did
on
june
the
confederates
on
the
second
day
of
the
fair
oaks
battle
was
to
them
a
blessing
in
disguise
it
put
mcclellan
at
his
ease
giving
lee
time
to
accomplish
three
extremely
important
ends
he
could
rest
and
recruit
his
army
fortify
the
south
of
richmond
with
stout
works
a
detail
which
had
not
been
attended
to
before
and
send
stonewall
jackson
down
the
valley
of
virginia
so
frightening
the
authorities
in
washington
that
they
dared
not
mcclellan
brilliant
victory
resulted
leaving
only
men
between
his
capital
and
his
foe
lee
on
june
threw
the
rest
across
the
upper
chickahominy
and
attacked
the
federal
right
fighting
terribly
at
mechanicsville
and
gaines
mill
hill
and
jackson
the
latter
having
made
forced
marches
from
the
shenandoah
to
join
in
the
movement
pushed
back
porter
corps
across
the
chickahominy
sundering
mcclellan
entirely
from
his
york
river
base
the
union
army
was
now
nearer
richmond
than
the
bulk
of
lee
which
was
beyond
the
chickahominy
at
that
time
none
too
easily
crossed
had
mcclellan
been
lee
or
grant
or
sherman
he
would
have
made
a
dash
for
richmond
but
he
was
mcclellan
and
lee
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
would
attempt
nothing
so
bold
retreat
was
the
northerner
thought
and
he
did
retreat
in
good
order
and
hitting
back
venomously
from
white
oak
swamp
and
malvern
hill
till
he
had
reached
harrison
landing
upon
the
james
where
gunboats
sheltered
and
fed
his
men
lee
felt
disappointed
with
the
seven
days
fighting
in
that
he
had
not
crushed
mcclellan
he
had
however
forced
him
to
raise
the
siege
of
richmond
and
to
retreat
thirty
or
forty
miles
the
confederacy
breathed
freely
again
and
its
gallant
chieftain
began
to
be
famous
the
new
leader
had
thus
far
given
only
hints
of
his
fertile
strategy
mcclellan
army
was
still
but
two
days
march
from
richmond
its
front
was
perfectly
fortified
mcclellan
was
an
engineer
gunboats
protected
its
flanks
lee
an
engineer
too
knew
that
to
attack
mcclellan
there
would
be
too
costly
yet
mcclellan
must
be
removed
and
this
before
he
could
be
for
an
advance
his
removal
was
accomplished
general
pope
was
threatening
richmond
from
the
north
the
government
expected
great
things
of
him
in
a
pompous
manifesto
he
had
given
out
that
retreating
days
were
over
that
his
headquarters
were
to
be
in
the
saddle
and
that
as
he
swept
on
to
richmond
where
he
evidently
expected
to
arrive
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
his
difficulty
was
going
to
be
not
to
whip
his
enemy
but
to
get
at
him
in
order
to
do
so
when
pope
wrote
that
manifesto
he
knew
many
men
but
there
was
one
man
whom
he
did
not
yet
know
it
was
stonewall
jackson
the
most
unique
and
interesting
character
rolled
into
notice
by
those
tempestuous
years
unless
nathan
bedford
forrest
is
the
exception
like
the
great
moslem
warrior
terrible
he
rode
alone
with
his
yemen
sword
for
aid
ornament
it
carried
none
save
the
notches
on
its
blade
jackson
was
an
intensely
religious
man
unlike
many
good
soldiers
he
wore
his
piety
into
camp
and
on
to
the
battlefield
and
would
not
have
hesitated
to
offer
prayer
to
the
god
of
battles
where
every
one
of
his
thirty
thousand
men
could
see
and
hear
and
all
those
soldiers
believed
in
the
efficacy
of
their
commander
prayers
jackson
was
also
a
stern
disciplinarian
if
men
in
any
way
sought
to
evade
duty
were
ordered
to
bring
them
into
line
if
necessary
at
the
point
in
consequence
when
the
day
of
battle
came
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
corps
who
did
not
feel
sure
that
if
he
shirked
duty
stonewall
jackson
would
shoot
him
and
god
almighty
would
damn
him
this
helped
to
render
jackson
thirty
thousand
perhaps
the
most
efficient
which
had
appeared
upon
the
battlefield
since
the
ironsides
of
oliver
cromwell
pope
was
destined
to
make
jackson
acquaintance
speedily
and
rather
unceremoniously
for
jackson
was
enough
instead
of
passing
in
his
card
at
pope
front
door
as
etiquette
required
to
present
it
at
the
before
pope
was
aware
his
enterprising
opponent
whose
war
motto
was
that
one
man
behind
your
enemy
is
worth
ten
in
his
front
had
gone
around
through
thoroughfare
gap
to
manassas
junction
and
planted
himself
august
square
across
the
only
railroad
that
ran
between
pope
army
and
washington
pope
should
have
volted
and
struck
jackson
like
lightning
before
the
rest
of
lee
army
could
come
up
but
two
considerations
made
him
slow
one
was
that
longstreet
wing
of
lee
army
was
now
rather
close
in
his
front
and
the
other
mortification
at
turning
back
after
having
started
southward
with
such
a
blare
of
trumpets
brave
confederate
soldiers
who
were
at
cedar
mountain
second
bull
run
and
chantilly
bear
witness
that
the
blood
pope
men
shed
in
those
battles
ran
red
but
dazed
tired
lacking
confidence
and
at
last
on
short
rations
and
faced
or
flanked
by
lee
whole
army
while
but
part
of
mcclellan
was
at
hand
they
fought
either
to
fall
or
to
retreat
again
no
one
witnessing
it
can
ever
forget
the
consternation
which
prevailed
in
the
fortifications
about
washington
the
night
after
the
battle
of
chantilly
the
writer
own
troop
manning
fort
ward
a
few
miles
out
from
alexandria
stood
to
its
heavy
guns
every
moment
of
that
dismal
night
gazing
frontwards
for
a
foe
the
name
stonewall
jackson
was
on
each
lip
at
the
break
of
dawn
when
to
weary
soldiers
trees
and
fences
easily
look
pokerish
brave
artillerists
swore
that
they
could
see
the
dreaded
warrior
charging
down
yonder
hill
heading
a
division
and
in
almost
agonizing
tones
begged
leave
to
load
for
action
lee
probably
made
a
mistake
in
entering
maryland
after
the
battle
of
chantilly
and
his
report
implies
that
he
would
not
at
this
time
have
done
so
for
merely
military
reasons
but
having
crossed
the
potomac
he
did
well
to
fight
at
sharpsburg
antietam
before
recrossing
this
was
well
because
it
was
bold
moreover
by
bruising
the
federals
there
he
delayed
them
getting
ample
time
for
ensconcing
his
army
on
the
rappahannock
front
for
the
winter
also
for
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
lee
deserves
no
special
praise
doubtless
his
unerring
engineer
eye
picked
the
and
his
already
great
prestige
inspired
his
brave
army
but
that
was
all
the
pluck
of
his
officers
and
men
and
incapacity
did
the
rest
never
did
a
general
carry
to
battle
a
better
plan
of
battle
than
fighting
joe
hooker
at
chancellorsville
may
and
rarely
has
one
marched
from
a
battle
that
had
proved
for
his
own
side
a
more
lamentable
fiasco
taking
the
offensive
with
vast
advantage
in
numbers
he
proposed
to
hold
lee
in
place
with
one
of
his
wings
while
he
thrust
the
other
behind
lee
left
between
the
confederate
army
and
richmond
but
he
had
started
a
game
at
which
two
could
play
and
had
challenged
a
more
deft
and
daring
gamester
than
himself
early
divining
his
purpose
lee
leaving
a
small
part
of
his
force
to
engage
hooker
left
with
the
rest
vigorously
assumed
the
sending
jackson
as
usual
around
hooker
extreme
right
both
movements
completely
succeeded
now
appeared
the
folly
of
promoting
a
general
to
the
headship
of
a
great
army
simply
because
of
his
and
his
success
with
a
division
or
a
corps
attacked
in
front
and
routed
on
his
flank
hooker
did
exactly
what
all
who
knew
him
would
have
taken
oath
that
he
would
never
do
instead
of
going
straight
ahead
with
vengeance
and
bidding
his
far
left
do
the
same
he
ordered
and
executed
a
retreat
to
his
old
position
north
of
the
rappahannock
there
were
those
who
laid
this
disaster
to
hooker
intemperance
president
lincoln
probably
had
such
a
suspicion
when
sending
general
hooker
west
to
join
general
sherman
he
admonished
him
in
passing
through
kentucky
to
steer
clear
of
bourbon
county
though
hooker
was
not
a
chancellorsville
is
not
to
be
explained
by
that
fact
any
more
than
jubal
a
early
defeat
by
sheridan
in
the
shenandoah
valley
is
referrible
to
his
use
of
hooker
did
not
create
his
own
defeat
as
burnside
may
with
little
exaggeration
be
said
to
have
done
at
fredericksburg
lee
defeated
him
and
deserved
the
immense
fame
which
the
victory
brought
no
wonder
he
began
to
plan
for
the
offensive
again
soon
the
gettysburg
campaign
was
begun
the
details
of
this
campaign
even
those
of
the
battle
itself
july
we
can
not
give
here
nor
need
we
the
world
knows
them
the
first
day
with
hill
and
ewell
success
costing
the
union
the
life
of
its
gallant
general
reynolds
commanding
the
first
corps
the
second
day
when
back
and
forth
by
the
devil
den
hood
on
one
side
and
dan
sickles
on
the
other
fought
their
men
as
soldiers
had
never
fought
on
the
american
continent
before
and
the
third
day
when
for
an
hour
a
hundred
cannon
on
seminary
ridge
belched
at
a
hundred
cannon
on
cemetery
ridge
prelude
in
the
natural
key
to
charge
a
thousand
fell
where
kemper
led
a
thousand
died
where
garnett
bled
in
blinding
flame
and
strangling
smoke
the
remnant
through
the
batteries
broke
and
crossed
the
works
with
armistead
the
union
army
was
for
the
first
time
fighting
a
great
battle
on
union
soil
the
homes
of
many
who
were
engaged
stood
within
sound
of
the
gettysburg
cannon
as
the
confederates
did
in
many
other
engagements
the
federals
here
felt
that
they
were
repelling
an
invader
and
they
fought
accordingly
with
a
grim
iron
resisting
power
which
they
had
never
displayed
before
great
praise
was
due
to
general
hancock
and
perhaps
still
more
to
general
howard
for
early
perceiving
the
strength
of
cemetery
hill
as
a
defensible
position
on
the
first
day
after
general
reynolds
had
fallen
at
his
post
of
duty
with
the
first
corps
general
doubleday
next
in
command
was
on
the
point
of
ordering
a
retreat
the
attack
seeming
too
fearful
to
be
withstood
but
howard
coming
up
with
the
eleventh
corps
and
assuming
command
of
the
field
overruled
doubleday
and
by
enforcing
a
most
stubborn
resistance
against
hill
and
desperate
onsets
probably
saved
cemetery
hill
from
capture
that
evening
so
far
as
has
ever
yet
been
made
apparent
every
plan
which
lee
formed
for
the
battle
of
gettysburg
every
order
which
he
gave
was
wise
and
right
we
do
not
except
even
his
management
on
the
third
day
it
is
easy
to
find
fault
with
dispositions
when
they
have
failed
of
happy
results
men
have
said
that
instead
of
attacking
in
front
on
that
day
lee
should
have
drawn
ewell
from
the
left
and
thrown
him
to
longstreet
right
manoeuvring
meade
out
of
his
position
but
in
this
matter
too
judgment
was
probably
good
changing
his
plan
of
attack
would
have
been
a
partial
confession
of
defeat
to
some
extent
disheartening
his
men
the
union
sixth
corps
fresh
and
free
general
john
sedgwick
at
its
head
was
sure
to
have
pounced
on
any
troops
seeking
to
trouble
left
and
had
meade
been
successfully
flanked
and
forced
back
he
would
have
retired
to
pipe
creek
and
been
stronger
than
ever
of
course
pickett
should
never
have
been
sent
forward
alone
you
could
wade
the
atlantic
as
easily
as
he
unsupported
could
go
beyond
that
stone
wall
but
from
all
one
can
learn
lee
was
in
fact
not
responsible
for
pickett
lack
of
support
although
in
almost
guilty
nobleness
of
spirit
he
assumed
the
responsibility
and
silently
rested
under
the
imputation
of
it
till
his
death
had
lee
great
subordinates
ewell
at
nightfall
on
the
first
day
and
longstreet
on
the
other
two
days
seconded
him
with
the
alacrity
and
devotion
usually
displayed
by
them
or
had
stonewall
jackson
been
still
alive
and
in
the
place
of
either
of
these
generals
the
issue
of
the
battle
would
almost
to
a
certainty
have
been
very
different
from
what
it
was
a
soldier
who
had
often
followed
to
victory
the
enterprising
graham
of
claverhouse
but
under
a
weaker
leader
saw
a
battle
wavering
cried
out
o
for
one
hour
of
dundee
so
must
lee
often
have
sighed
for
stonewall
the
loss
of
whom
at
chancellorsville
made
that
for
the
confederacy
a
sort
of
pyrrhic
victory
lee
skill
at
gettysburg
has
been
questioned
in
that
he
fought
his
army
upon
the
longer
line
the
big
fishhook
described
by
his
position
lying
outside
the
little
one
formed
by
the
federal
army
but
lee
fought
on
the
outer
line
also
at
second
bull
run
winning
one
of
the
neatest
victories
in
modern
warfare
john
codman
ropes
the
military
critic
says
of
this
battle
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
better
instance
of
that
masterly
comprehension
of
the
actual
condition
of
things
which
marks
a
great
general
than
was
exhibited
in
general
lee
allowing
our
formidable
attack
in
which
more
than
half
the
federal
army
was
taking
part
to
be
fully
developed
and
to
burst
upon
the
exhausted
troops
of
stonewall
jackson
while
lee
relying
upon
the
ability
of
that
able
soldier
to
maintain
his
position
was
maturing
and
arranging
for
the
great
attack
on
our
left
flank
by
the
powerful
corps
of
longstreet
in
prussia
war
with
austria
in
von
moltke
plan
at
the
battle
of
sadowa
where
he
splendidly
triumphed
was
in
the
same
respect
a
close
imitation
of
lee
at
gettysburg
the
prussians
occupied
the
outer
line
the
austrians
the
inner
when
the
pickets
closed
in
the
morning
von
moltke
saluted
king
william
and
said
your
majesty
will
win
not
only
the
battle
but
the
campaign
at
noon
this
did
not
appear
possible
prince
frederick
charles

were
withering
under
the
hottest
artillery
fire
of
the
century
save
that
at
gettysburg
just
three
years
earlier
to
the
hour
it
seemed
as
if
in
fifteen
minutes
they
must
give
way
but
hark
what
means
that
cheering
on
the
left

boom

he

the

of
that
battlefield
he
enfilades
the
whole
austrian
line
benedek
is
beaten
on
to
vienna
the
war
is
ended
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
general
lee
ordered
his
brave
men
southward
again
a
heart
made
heavier
by
many
a
stinging
criticism
against
him
in
the
southern
press
the
resolution
that
bore
him
up
at
this
crisis
was
morally
sublime
he
could
not
hope
to
strengthen
his
army
more
for
a
time
he
had
to
weaken
it
by
sending
longstreet
west
to
assist
bragg
in
fighting
the
battle
of
chickamauga
clothing
rations
animals
and
forage
as
well
as
men
were
increasingly
scarce
the
south
was
exhausted
much
sooner
than
any
expected
having
greatly
overestimated
its
wealth
by
taking
exports
and
imports
for
gauge
doubtful
if
ever
before
was
so
large
and
populous
a
region
so
far
from
the
force
against
lee
on
the
other
hand
was
daily
becoming
stronger
till
gettysburg
lee
had
toyed
with
the
army
of
the
potomac
not
because
the
rank
and
file
of
that
army
was
at
fault
and
not
mainly
because
of
its
generals
inability
but
mostly
because
of
political
interference
with
its
operations
the
great
and
revered
president
lincoln
with
all
his
powers
was
not
a
military
man
no
more
was

stanton
they
secured
the
best
military
aid
they
could
from
an
early
period
general
halleck
old
brains
men
called
him
because
of
his
immense
military
information
was
their
constant
adviser
and
though
he
was
a
scholar
rather
than
a
genius
he
could
doubtless
have
saved
them
many
an
error
had
they
heeded
his
counsel
instead
of
civilian
clamor
how
impressively
did
not
the
civil
war
teach
that
fine
military
scholarship
alone
while
it
may
greatly
add
to
a
general
efficiency
can
not
make
a
true
military
leader
compare
halleck
with
grant
or
sherman
the
creoles
of
louisiana
considered
their
beauregard
the
plus
military
genius
of
the
south
one
of
them
was
once
asked
his
opinion
of
general
lee
he
replied
in
his
broken
english
o
gen
lee
a
good
good
indeed
gen
beaugar
speak
of
gen
lee
so
at
last
did
halleck
speak
of
grant
but
gettysburg
convinced
lee
that
he
could
toy
with
the
potomac
army
no
longer
and
this
was
more
than
ever
impossible
after
grant
took
command
then
greek
met
greek
and
the
death
grapple
began
at
the
wilderness
at
spottsylvania
and
most
mercilessly
of
all
at
cold
harbor
grant
drove
his
colossal
against
lee
gray
wall
only
to
find
it
solid
as
gibraltar
this
struggle
tested
both
commanders
mettle
to
the
utmost
at
the
end
of
the
hammering
campaign
after
losing
men
enough
to
form
an
army
as
large
as
lee
grant
van
was
full
twice
as
far
from
richmond
as
mcclellan
had
been
two
years
before
not
once
was
lee
flanked
duped
or
surprised
as
always
hitherto
so
now
his
darling
mode
of
defence
was
offence
to
fight
grant
every
blow
being
met
with
another
before
it
hit
only
once
were
lee
lines
forced
straight
back
to
stay
even
then
at
the
spottsylvania
bloody
angle
the
ground
he
lost
hardly
sufficed
to
graveyard
the
union
men
killed
in
getting
it
in
swinging
round
to
petersburg
and
again
at
the
springing
of
the
petersburg
mine
grant
thought
himself
sure
to
make
enormous
gains
but
lee
insight
into
his
purposes
and
lightning
celerity
in
checkmating
these
foiled
both
movements
giving
the
mine
operation
moreover
the
effect
of
a
deadly
boomerang
spite
of
all
this
the
end
of
the
confederacy
was
in
sight
from
the
moment
of
grant
arrival
at
petersburg
during
the
three
years
that
lee
and
his
indomitable
aides
and
soldiers
had
been
holding
at
bay
brave
and
perfectly
appointed
armies
vastly
outnumbering
them
and
twice
boldly
assuming
the
offensive
with
disaster
indeed
yet
with
glory
two
other
grand
campaigns
had
been
going
on
wherein
the
confederacy
had
fared
much
worse
the
capture
of
new
orleans
of
island
no
ten
and
of
vicksburg
had
let
the
father
of
waters
again
run
unvexed
to
the
sea
a
second
line
of
operations
murfreesborough
chattanooga
atlanta
and
savannah
had
divided
the
confederacy
afresh
sherman
army
which
had
achieved
this
began
on
to
march
northward
from
savannah
bravery
in
camp
and
field
and
deathless
endurance
at
home
could
not
take
the
place
of
bread
the
blockade
was
to
be
sure
for
some
time
extensively
evaded
admitting
english
wares
of
all
sorts
in
great
quantities
but
in
no
long
time
the
blockade
tightened
moreover
comparatively
little
cotton
was
raised
which
could
in
any
event
have
been
exported
credit
failing
imports
if
any
had
to
be
paid
for
in
money
this
of
course
was
soon
spent
and
then
importation
ceased
privateers
destroyed
but
could
bring
nothing
home
as
the
war
progressed
kentucky
missouri
tennessee
louisiana
and
with
the
fall
of
vicksburg
the
whole
immense
tract
were
lost
to
the
confederacy
sherman
march
isolated
also
mississippi
alabama
and
georgia
the
dearth
of
necessaries
save
corn
and
bacon
became
desperate
salt
and
wheat
bread
were
rare
luxuries
in
a
suit
of
jean
cost
a
spool
of
cotton
a
pound
of
bacon
it
should
of
course
be
borne
in
mind
that
these
high
prices
in
part
represented
the
depreciation
of
confederate
paper
money
drastic
drafting
and
the
arming
of
negroes
could
avail
little
for
lack
of
accoutrements
and
food
thus
lee
capitulation
at
appomattox
april
represents
less
a
defeat
of
his
army
than
the
breakdown
of
the
confederacy
at
large
so
true
and
impressive
is
this
that
reflection
upon
it
makes
the
last
year
of
lee
commandership
seem
peculiarly
glorious
only
by
rarest
genius
surely
were
those
dazzling
tactics
that
sleepless
watchfulness
that
superhuman
patience
and
superhuman
valor
protracted
incessant
for
a
whole
year
keeping
intact
victorious
and
full
of
inspiration
that
gray
line
ever
longer
ever
thinner
of
men
outnumbered
two
then
three
and
at
last
five
to
one
whose
food
and
clothing
grew
scantier
with
the
days
while
the
bounties
of
a
continent
replenished
their
opponents
keeping
that
tenuous
line
unbroken
till
very
starvation
unfitted
soldiers
to
handle
muskets
which
must
be
used
empty
if
at
all
because
ammunition
was
spent
and
when
we
recall
that
all
this
was
accomplished
not
because
the
union
army
was
cowardly
or
asleep
but
in
spite
of
grant
relentless
push
and
an
ably
led
army
as
brave
wary
and
determined
as
ever
marched
let
us
ask
critics
versed
in
the
history
of
war
if
books
tell
of
generalship
more
complete
than
this
lee
military
conduct
revealed
it
must
be
admitted
one
weakness
that
of
undue
leniency
toward
slack
dilatory
and
opinionated
subordinates
this
was
however
only
in
part
lee
personal
fault
mainly
it
was
the
military
counterpart
of
the
infirmity
inherent
in
a
confederacy
which
in
every
possible
way
deified
the
individual
state
and
snubbed
the
central
power
without
jeopardizing
the
confederacy
lee
could
not
at
gettysburg
deal
with
longstreet
as
grant
did
with
warren
at
five
forks
or
as
sherman
did
with
palmer
in
north
carolina
it
seems
that
lee
orders
to
his
main
subordinates
were
habitually
of
the
nature
of
requests
yet
what
obedience
was
not
accorded
him
in
spite
of
this
most
striking
among
the
characteristics
of
general
lee
which
made
him
so
successful
was
his
exalted
and
unmatched
excellence
as
a
man
his
unselfishness
sweetness
gentleness
patience
love
of
justice
and
general
elevation
of
soul
lee
much
loved
to
quote
sir
william
hamilton
words
on
earth
nothing
great
but
man
in
man
nothing
great
but
mind
he
always
added
however
in
mind
nothing
great
save
devotion
to
truth
and
duty
though
a
soldier
and
at
last
very
eminent
as
a
soldier
he
retained
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
his
career
the
entire
temper
and
character
of
an
ideal
civilian
he
did
not
sink
the
man
in
the
military
man
he
had
all
a
soldier
virtues
the
chevalier
without
fear
and
without
reproach
but
he
was
glorified
by
a
whole
galaxy
of
excellences
which
soldiers
too
often
lack
he
was
pure
of
speech
and
of
habit
never
intemperate
never
obscene
never
profane
never
irreverent
in
domestic
life
he
was
an
absolute
model
lofty
command
did
not
make
him
vain
the
southern
army
had
one
prominent
officer
with
a
high
ecclesiastical
title
the
rt
rev
leonidas
polk
bishop
of
louisiana
commanding
a
corps
in
bragg
army
he
was
killed
in
battle
at

mountain
during
sherman
advance
on
atlanta
stonewall
jackson
was
so
famed
for
his
rather
obtrusive
though
awfully
real
piety
that
men
named
him
the
havelock
of
the
army
but
none
who
knew
the
three
will
call
lee
less
a
christian
than
either
of
the
others
he
prayed
daily
for
his
enemies
in
arms
and
no
word
of
hate
toward
the
north
ever
escaped
his
tongue
or
his
pen
he
had
the
faith
and
devotion
of
a
true
crusader
his
letters
breathe
the
spirit
of
a
better
earth
than
this
collected
into
a
volume
they
would
make
an
invaluable
book
of
devotional
literature
no

officers
and

passionately
loved

ah

thou

thou
wert
never

of

and
thou
wert
the

the
sternest
knight

that

exquisitely
appropriate

one
hand
and
on
the
other
with
callicratidas
and
saint
louis
with
the
chevalier
bayard
and
sir
philip
sidney
a
remarkable
trait
of
general
lee
military
character
was
his
tireless
and
irresistible
energy
while
one
whom
he
deemed
a
foe
of
his
state
remained
on
her
soil
he
could
not
rest
from
the
moment
he
took
command
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
all
was
action
in
that
army
during
the
nine
weeks
after
hill
struck
mechanicsville
that
earthquake
shock
how
did
not
the
change
richmond
was
set
free
washington
was
threatened
lee
whipped
mcclellan
before
pope
could
help
then
pope
before
mcclellan
could
help
the
first
evening
at
gettysburg
longstreet
having
impressively
pointed
out
the
strength
of
meade
position
on
cemetery
hill
lee
instantly
replied
if
he
is
there
in
the
morning
i
shall
attack
him
the
second
morning
of
the
wilderness
battle
grant
obviously
expecting
to
anticipate
all
movement
upon
the
other
side
ordered
charge
at
five
lee
charged
at
four
grant
was
determined
to
reach
spottsylvania
first
but
there
too
lee
awaited
him
having
had
some
hours
to
rest
prostrate
and
in
his
tent
one
day
during
grant
effort
to
flank
him
he
kept
murmuring
we
must
strike
them
we
must
not
let
them
pass
without
striking
them
longstreet
was
too
slow
for
him
and
so
was
even
the
hill
years
later
lee
dying
words
were
tell
hill
he
come
up
to
appreciate
his
agility
one
must
remember
that
lee
was
the
oldest
general
made
famous
by
the
war
it
is
thought
that
years
accounted
for
napoleon
refusal
to
fight
the
old
guard
at
borodino
as
his
ablest
generals
urged
napoleon
was
then
eleven
years
younger
than
lee
was
when
our
war
began
it
is
to
young
napoleon
we
must
turn
to
find
parallels
for
lee
celerity
second
bull
run
and
chancellorsville
may
fitly
be
compared
to
arcola
and
rivoli
it
has
been
observed
that
like
napoleon
lee
avoided
passive
defence
seeming
the
assailant
even
when
on
the
defensive
like
him
he
was
swift
and
terrible
in
availing
himself
of
an
enemy
mistakes
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
lee
campaigns
furnished
more
or
less
inspiration
and
direction
for
von
moltke
immortal
movements
in
and
in
that
lee
was
brave
need
not
be
said
he
was
not
as
rash
as
hood
and
cleburne
sometimes
were
he
knew
the
value
of
his
life
to
the
great
cause
and
usually
at
least
did
not
expose
himself
needlessly
prudence
he
had
but
no
fear
his
resolution
to
lead
the
charge
at
the
bloody
angle
rashness
for
once
shows
fearlessness
as
he
was
lee
felt
battle
frenzy
as
hardly
another
great
commander
ever
did
from
him
it
spread
like
magnetism
to
his
officers
and
men
thrilling
all
as
if
the
chief
himself
were
close
by
in
the
fray
shouting
now
fight
my
good
fellows
fight
yet
such
was
that
this
dreadful
ardor
never
carried
him
too
far
once
namely
at
fredericksburg
recovery
from
the
fighting
mood
perhaps
occurred
too
promptly
some
have
thought
this
suggesting
that
had
the
leash
not
been
applied
to
the
dogs
of
war
so
early
burnside
retreat
might
have
been
made
a
rout
but
lee
possessed
another
order
of
courage
infinitely
higher
and
rarer
than
this
the
sort
so
often
lacking
even
in
generals
who
have
served
with
utmost
distinction
in
high
subordinate
places
when
they
are
called
to
the
sole
and
decisive
direction
of
armies
he
had
that
royal
mettle
that
preternatural
decision
of
character
ever
tempered
with
caution
and
wisdom
which
leads
a
great
commander
when
true
occasion
arises
resolutely
to
give
general
battle
or
to
swing
out
away
from
his
base
upon
a
precarious
but
promising
campaign
here
you
have
moral
heroism
ordinary
valor
is
more
impulsive
a
weaker
man
albeit
total
stranger
to
fear
ready
to
lead
his
division
or
his
corps
into
the
very
mouth
of
hell
if
commanded
being
set
himself
to
direct
an
army
will
be
either
rash
or
else
too
timid
or
fidget

one
extreme
to
the
other
losing
all
hooker

bravely
at
chancellorsville
but
soon
grew

and

hood
says
that
hardee
timidity
lost
him
a
great
victory
at
decatur
the
day
the
union
general
mcpherson
fell
and
that
cheatham
at
spring
hill
during
his
northward
pursuit
of
thomas
lost
him
another
yet
hooker
hardee
and
cheatham
were
men
to
whom
personal
fear
was
a
meaningless
phrase
stonewall
jackson
was
personally
no
braver
than
they
it
was
his
bravery
of
the
higher
sort
that
set
him
as
a
general
so
incomparably
above
them
the
same
high
quality
belonged
to
grant
and
sherman
and
to
washington
and
greene
in
the
revolutionary
war
it
was
in
this
supreme
kind
of
boldness
that
robert
lee
excelled
cautious
always
he
still
took
risks
and
responsibilities
which
common
generals
would
not
have
dared
to
take
and
when
he
had
assumed
these
his
mighty
will
forbade
him
to
sink
under
the
load
the
braying
of
bitter
critics
the
obloquy
of
men
who
should
have
supported
him
the
shots
from
behind
dismayed
him
no
more
than
did
cannon
at
fredericksburg
on
he
pressed
stout
as
a
titan
relentless
as
fate
what
time
bravest
hearts
failed
at
victory
delay
this
dreadnaught
rose
to
his
best
and
furnished
courage
for
the
whole

lee
campaigns
and
battles
exhibit
the
triumph
of
profound
intelligence
of
calculation
and
of
force
over
numbers
and
disunited
counsels
lee
always
manoeuvred
he
never
merely
pitched
in
as

mcclellan
so
both
at

and
at

he

by

cunningly
planted
to
enfilade
the

front
shattered
the
federals
attacking
column
and
placed
stonewall
at
his
ease
considering
everything
his
paucity
of
men
and
means
the
necessity
always
upon
him
of
reckoning
with
political
as
well
as
with
military
situations
and
his
success
in
holding
even
grant
at
bay
so
long
masterful
campaigns
of

not

constitute
him
the
foremost
military
virtuoso

eugene
napoleon
wellington
and
von
moltke
in
a
sense
of
course
the
cause
for
which
lee
fought
was
lost
yet
a
very
great
part
of
what
he
and
his
sought
the
war
actually
secured
and
assured
his
cause
was
not
lost
as
hannibal
was
whose
country
with
its
institutions

of
his
genius
and
devotion
utterly
perished
from
the
earth
yet
hannibal
is
remembered
more
widely
than
scipio
were
lee
in
the
same
case
with
hannibal
men
would
magnify
his
name
as
long
as

is

illustrious
men
says
thucydides
the

not
alone
by
columns
and
inscriptions
in
their
own
lands
memorials
to
them
rise
in
foreign
countries
as
well
not
of
stone
it
may
be
but
unwritten
in
the
thoughts
of
posterity
lee
case
resembles
cromwell
much
more
than
hannibal
the
against
which
cromwell
warred
returned
in
spite
of
him
but
it
returned
modified
involving
all
the
reforms
for
which
the
chieftain
had
bled
so
the
best
of
what
lee
drew
sword
for
is
here
in
our
actual
america
and
please
god
shall
remain
here
forever
decisions
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
since
secession
give
a
sweep
and
a
certainty
to
the
rights
of
states
and
limit
the
central
power
in
this
republic
as
had
never
been
done
before
the
wild
doctrines
of
sumner
and
thaddeus
stevens
on
these
points
are
not
our
law
if
the
union
is
perpetual
equally
so
is
each
state
the
republic
is
an
indestructible
union
of
indestructible
states
if
this
part
of
our
law
had
in
received
its
present
definition
and
emphasis
and
if
the
southern
states
had
then
been
sure
come
what
might
of
the
freedom
they
actually
now
enjoy
each
to
govern
itself
in
its
own
way
even
south
carolina
might
never
have
voted
secession
and
inasmuch
as
the
war
better
than
aught
else
could
have
done
forced
this
phase
of
the
constitution
out
into
clear
expression
general
lee
did
not
fight
in
vain
the
essential
good
he
wished
has
come
while
the
republic
with
its
priceless
benedictions
to
us
all
remains
intact
all
americans
thus
have
part
in
robert
lee
not
only
as
a
peerless
man
and
soldier
but
as
the
sturdy
miner
the
rock
of
our
liberties
till
it
gave
forth
its
gold
none
are
prouder
of
his
record
than
those
who
fought
against
him
who
while
recognizing
the
purity
of
his
motive
thought
him
in
error
in
going
from
under
the
stars
and
stripes
it
is
likely
that
more
american
hearts
day
by
day
think
lovingly
of
lee
than
of
any
other
civil
war
celebrity
save
lincoln
alone
and
his
praise
will
increase
it
was
thoroughly
characteristic
of
lee
that
he
would
not
after
the
war
leave
the
country
as
a
few
eminent
confederates
did
and
also
that
he
refused
all
mere
titular
positions
with
high
salaries
several
of
which
were
urged
on
him
out
of
consideration
for
his
character
and
fame
he
was
however
persuaded
to
accept
in
the
presidency
of
washington
college
at
lexington
an
institution
founded
on
gifts
made
by
washington
and
at
present
known
as
washington
and
lee
university
in
this
position
the
great
man
spent
his
remaining
years
joining
refinement
and
dignity
to
usefulness
and
revered
by
all
who
came
within
the
charmed
circle
of
his
influence
since
he
had
suffered
more
or
less
with
rheumatism
of
the
heart
and
from
the
middle
of
was
never
quite
strong
spite
of
this
with
the
exception
of
brief
holidays
he
performed
all
his
duties
till
when
at
his
family
as
he
stood
to
say
grace
it
was
his
wont
to
say
grace
before
meat
and
to
stand
in
doing
so
he
was
stricken
had
to
sit
then
be
helped
to
his
bed
he
never
rose
though
languishing
a
number
of
days
he
died

nine
