preface
the
history
of
the
naval
events
of
the
war
of
has
been
repeatedly
presented
both
to
the
american
and
the
english
reader
historical
writers
have
treated
it
either
in
connection
with
a
general
account
of
the
contest
on
land
and
sea
or
as
forming
a
part
of
the
complete
record
of
the
navies
of
the
two
nations
a
few
monographs
which
confine
themselves
strictly
to
the
naval
occurrences
have
also
appeared
but
none
of
these
works
can
be
regarded
as
giving
a
satisfactorily
full
or
impartial
account
of
the
war
some
of
them
being
of
he
popular
and
order
while
others
treat
it
from
a
purely
partisan
standpoint
no
single
book
can
be
quoted
which
would
be
accepted
by
the
modern
reader
as
doing
justice
to
both
sides
or
indeed
as
telling
the
whole
story
any
one
specially
interested
in
the
subject
must
read
all
and
then
it
will
seem
almost
a
hopeless
task
to
reconcile
the
many
and
widely
contradictory
statements
he
will
meet
with
there
appear
to
be
three
works
which
taken
in
combination
give
the
best
satisfaction
on
the
subject
first
in
james
naval
history
of
great
britain
which
supplies
both
the
material
and
the
opinions
of
almost
every
subsequent
english
or
canadian
historian
can
be
found
the
british
view
of
the
case
it
is
an
invaluable
work
written
with
fulness
and
care
on
the
other
hand
it
is
also
a
piece
of
special
pleading
by
a
bitter
and
not
partisan
this
in
the
second
place
can
be
partially
supplemented
by
fenimore
naval
history
of
the
united
states
the
latter
gives
the
american
view
of
the
cruises
and
battles
but
it
is
much
less
of
an
authority
than
james
both
because
it
is
written
without
great
regard
for
exactness
and
because
all
figures
for
the
american
side
need
to
be
supplied
from
lieutenant
now
admiral
george
emmons
statistical
history
of
the
united
states
navy
which
is
the
third
of
the
works
in
question
but
even
after
comparing
these
three
authors
many
contradictions
remain
unexplained
and
the
truth
can
only
be
reached
in
such
cases
by
a
careful
examination
of
the
navy
records
the
london
naval
chronicle
niles
register
and
other
similar
documentary
publications
almost
the
only
good
criticisms
on
the
actions
are
those
incidentally
given
in
standard
works
on
other
subjects
such
as
lord
howard
douglass
naval
gunnery
and
admiral
jurien
de
la
gravi√®re
guerres
maritimes
much
of
the
material
in
our
navy
department
has
never
been
touched
at
all
in
short
no
full
accurate
and
unprejudiced
history
of
the
war
has
ever
been
written
the
subject
merits
a
closer
scrutiny
than
it
has
received
at
present
people
are
beginning
to
realize
that
it
is
folly
for
the
great
republic
to
rely
for
defence
upon
a
navy
composed
partly
of
antiquated
hulks
and
partly
of
new
vessels
rather
more
worthless
than
the
old
it
is
worth
while
to
study
with
some
care
that
period
of
our
history
during
which
our
navy
stood
at
the
highest
pitch
of
its
fame
and
to
learn
any
thing
from
the
past
it
is
necessary
to
know
as
near
as
may
be
the
exact
truth
accordingly
the
work
should
be
written
impartially
if
only
from
the
narrowest
motives
without
abating
a
jot
from
one
devotion
to
his
country
and
flag
i
think
a
history
can
be
made
just
enough
to
warrant
its
being
received
as
an
authority
equally
among
americans
and
englishmen
i
have
endeavored
to
supply
such
a
work
it
is
impossible
that
errors
both
of
fact
and
opinion
should
not
have
crept
into
it
and
although
i
have
sought
to
make
it
in
character
as
as
possible
these
errors
will
probably
be
in
favor
of
the
american
side
as
my
only
object
is
to
give
an
accurate
narrative
of
events
i
shall
esteem
it
a
particular
favor
if
any
one
will
furnish
me
with
the
means
of
rectifying
such
mistakes
and
if
i
have
done
injustice
to
any
commander
or
officer
of
any
grade
whether
american
or
british
i
shall
consider
myself
under
great
obligations
to
those
who
will
set
me
right
i
have
been
unable
to
get
access
to
the
original
reports
of
the
british
commanders
the
logs
of
the
british
ships
or
their
and
so
have
been
obliged
to
take
them
at
second
hand
from
the
gazette
or
naval
chronicle
or
some
standard
history
the
american
official
letters
original
contracts
however
being
preserved
in
the
archives
at
washington
i
have
been
able
thanks
to
the
courtesy
of
the
hon
wm
hunt
secretary
of
the
navy
to
look
them
over
the
set
of
letters
from
the
officers
is
very
complete
in
three
series
letters
masters
commandant
letters
and
officers
letters
there
being
several
volumes
for
each
year
the
books
of
contracts
contain
valuable
information
as
to
the
size
and
build
of
some
of
the
vessels
the
are
rather
exasperating
often
being
very
incomplete
thus
when
i
turned
from
decatur
extremely
vague
official
letter
describing
the
capture
of
the
macedonian
to
the
of
the
frigate
not
a
fact
about
the
fight
could
be
gleaned
the
last
entry
in
the
log
on
the
day
of
the
fight
is
strange
sail
discovered
to
be
a
frigate
under
english
colors
and
the
next
entry
on
the
following
day
relates
to
the
removal
of
the
prisoners
the
log
of
the
is
very
full
indeed
for
most
of
the
time
but
is
a
perfect
blank
for
the
period
during
which
she
was
commanded
by
lieutenant
burrows
and
in
which
she
fought
the
boxer
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
the
peacock
log
at
all
though
there
is
a
very
full
set
of
letters
from
her
commander
probably
the
fire
of
destroyed
a
great
deal
of
valuable
material
when
ever
it
was
possible
i
have
referred
to
printed
matter
in
preference
to
manuscript
and
my
authorities
can
thus
in
most
cases
be
easily
consulted
in
conclusion
i
desire
to
express
my
sincerest
thanks
to
captain
james
bulloch
formerly
of
the
united
states
navy
and
commander
adolf
mensing
formerly
of
the
german
navy
without
whose
advice
and
sympathy
this
work
would
probably
never
have
been
written
or
even
begun
new
york
city
preface
to
third
edition
i
originally
intended
to
write
a
companion
volume
to
this
which
should
deal
with
the
operations
on
land
but
a
short
examination
showed
that
these
operations
were
hardly
worth
serious
study
they
teach
nothing
new
it
is
the
old
old
lesson
that
a
miserly
economy
in
preparation
may
in
the
end
involve
a
lavish
outlay
of
men
and
money
which
after
all
comes
too
late
to
more
than
partially
offset
the
evils
produced
by
the
original
parsimony
this
might
be
a
lesson
worth
dwelling
on
did
it
have
any
practical
bearing
on
the
issues
of
the
present
day
but
it
has
none
as
far
as
the
army
is
concerned
it
was
criminal
folly
for
jefferson
and
his
follower
madison
to
neglect
to
give
us
a
force
either
of
regulars
or
of
volunteers
during
the
twelve
years
they
had
in
which
to
prepare
for
the
struggle
that
any
one
might
see
was
inevitable
but
there
is
now
far
less
need
of
an
army
than
there
was
then
circumstances
have
altered
widely
since
instead
of
the
decaying
might
of
spain
on
our
southern
frontier
we
have
the
still
weaker
power
of
mexico
instead
of
the
great
indian
nations
of
the
interior
able
to
keep
civilization
at
bay
to
hold
in
check
strong
armies
to
ravage
large
stretches
of
territory
and
needing
formidable
military
expeditions
to
overcome
them
there
are
now
only
left
broken
and
scattered
bands
which
are
sources
of
annoyance
merely
to
the
north
we
are
still
hemmed
in
by
the
canadian
possessions
of
great
britain
but
since
our
strength
has
increased
so
prodigiously
both
absolutely
and
relatively
while
england
military
power
has
remained
almost
stationary
that
we
need
now
be
under
no
apprehensions
from
her
for
even
if
checked
in
the
beginning
we
could
not
help
conquering
in
the
end
by
sheer
weight
of
numbers
if
by
nothing
else
so
that
there
is
now
no
cause
for
our
keeping
up
a
large
army
while
on
the
contrary
the
necessity
for
an
efficient
navy
is
so
evident
that
only
our
almost
incredible
prevents
our
at
once
preparing
one
not
only
do
the
events
of
the
war
on
land
teach
very
little
to
the
statesman
who
studies
history
in
order
to
avoid
in
the
present
the
mistakes
of
the
past
but
besides
this
the
battles
and
campaigns
are
of
little
interest
to
the
student
of
military
matters
the
british
regulars
trained
in
many
wars
thrashed
the
raw
troops
opposed
to
them
whenever
they
had
any
thing
like
a
fair
chance
but
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
the
same
thing
has
always
happened
the
world
over
under
similar
conditions
our
defeats
were
exactly
such
as
any
man
might
have
foreseen
and
there
is
nothing
to
be
learned
from
the
follies
committed
by
incompetent
commanders
and
untrained
troops
when
in
the
presence
of
skilled
officers
having
under
them
disciplined
soldiers
the
humiliating
surrenders
abortive
attacks
and
panic
routs
of
our
armies
can
all
be
paralleled
in
the
campaigns
waged
by
napoleon
marshals
against
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
in
the
years
immediately
preceding
the
outbreak
of
our
own
war
the
peninsular
troops
were
as
little
able
to
withstand
the
french
veterans
as
were
our
militia
to
hold
their
own
against
the
british
regulars
but
it
must
always
be
remembered
to
our
credit
that
while
seven
years
of
fighting
failed
to
make
the
spaniards
able
to
face
the
french
footnote
at
the
closing
battle
of
toulouse
fought
between
the
allies
and
the
french
the
flight
of
the
spaniards
was
so
rapid
and
universal
as
to
draw
from
the
duke
of
wellington
the
bitter
observation
that
though
he
had
seen
a
good
many
remarkable
things
in
the
course
of
his
life
yet
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
seen
ten
thousand
men
running
a
race
two
years
of
warfare
gave
us
soldiers
who
could
stand
against
the
best
men
of
britain
on
the
northern
frontier
we
never
developed
a
great
general
brown
claim
to
the
title
rests
only
on
his
not
having
committed
the
phenomenal
follies
of
his
predecessors
but
by
our
soldiers
had
become
seasoned
and
we
had
acquired
some
good
brigade
commanders
notably
scott
so
that
in
that
year
we
played
on
even
terms
with
the
british
but
the
battles
though
marked
by
as
bloody
and
obstinate
fighting
as
ever
took
place
were
waged
between
small
bodies
of
men
and
were
not
distinguished
by
any
feats
of
generalship
so
that
they
are
not
of
any
special
interest
to
the
historian
in
fact
the
only
really
noteworthy
feat
of
arms
of
the
war
took
place
at
new
orleans
and
the
only
military
genius
that
the
struggle
developed
was
andrew
jackson
his
deeds
are
worthy
of
all
praise
and
the
battle
he
won
was
in
many
ways
so
peculiar
as
to
make
it
well
worth
a
much
closer
study
than
it
has
yet
received
it
was
by
far
the
most
prominent
event
of
the
war
it
was
a
victory
which
reflected
high
honor
on
the
general
and
soldiers
who
won
it
and
it
was
in
its
way
as
remarkable
as
any
of
the
great
battles
that
took
place
about
the
same
time
in
europe
such
being
the
case
i
have
devoted
a
chapter
to
its
consideration
at
the
conclusion
of
the
chapters
devoted
to
the
naval
operations
as
before
said
the
other
campaigns
on
land
do
not
deserve
very
minute
attention
but
for
the
sake
of
rendering
the
account
of
the
battle
of
new
orleans
more
intelligible
i
will
give
a
hasty
sketch
of
the
principal
engagements
that
took
place
elsewhere
the
war
opened
in
of
by
the
campaign
of
general
hull
on
the
michigan
frontier
with
two
or
three
thousand
raw
troops
he
invaded
canada
about
the
same
time
fort
mackinaw
was
surrendered
by
its
garrison
of
americans
to
a
british
and
indian
force
of
hull
campaign
was
unfortunate
from
the
beginning
near
brownstown
the
american
colonel
van
horne
with
some
men
was
ambushed
and
routed
by
tecumseh
and
his
indians
in
revenge
miller
with
americans
at
maguaga
attacked
british
and
canadians
under
capt
muir
and
indians
under
tecumseh
and
whipped
them
tecumseh
indians
standing
their
ground
longest
the
americans
lost
their
foes
men
at
chicago
the
small
force
of
americans
was
surprised
and
massacred
by
the
indians
meanwhile
general
brock
the
british
commander
advanced
against
hull
with
a
rapidity
and
decision
that
seemed
to
paralyze
his
senile
and
irresolute
opponent
the
latter
retreated
to
detroit
where
without
striking
a
blow
he
surrendered
men
to
nearly
equal
force
which
consisted
nearly
one
half
of
indians
under
tecumseh
on
the
niagara
frontier
an
estimable
and
honest
old
gentleman
and
worthy
citizen
who
knew
nothing
of
military
matters
van
rensselaer
tried
to
cross
over
and
attack
the
british
at
queenstown
americans
got
across
and
were
almost
all
killed
or
captured
by
a
nearly
equal
number
of
british
canadians
and
indians
while
on
the
opposite
side
a
large
number
of
their
countrymen
looked
on
and
with
abject
cowardice
refused
to
cross
to
their
assistance
the
command
of
the
army
was
then
handed
over
to
a
ridiculous
personage
named
smythe
who
issued
proclamations
so
bombastic
that
they
really
must
have
come
from
an
unsound
mind
and
then
made
a
ludicrously
abortive
effort
at
invasion
which
failed
almost
of
its
own
accord
a
british
and
canadian
force
of
less
than
men
was
foiled
in
an
assault
on
ogdensburg
after
a
slight
skirmish
by
about
americans
under
brown
and
with
this
trifling
success
the
military
operations
of
the
year
came
to
an
end
early
in
ogdensburg
was
again
attacked
this
time
by
between
and
british
who
took
it
after
a
brisk
resistance
from
some
militia
the
british
lost
and
the
americans
in
killed
and
wounded
general
harrison
meanwhile
had
begun
the
campaign
in
the
northwest
at
frenchtown
on
the
river
raisin
command
of
about
western
troops
was
surprised
by
a
force
of
men
half
of
them
indians
under
the
british
colonel
proctor
the
right
division
taken
by
surprise
gave
up
at
once
the
left
division
mainly
kentucky
riflemen
and
strongly
posted
in
houses
and
stockaded
enclosures
made
a
stout
resistance
and
only
surrendered
after
a
bloody
fight
in
which
british
and
about
half
as
many
indians
were
killed
or
wounded
over
americans
were
slain
some
in
battle
but
most
in
the
bloody
massacre
that
followed
after
this
general
harrison
went
into
camp
at
fort
meigs
where
with
about
men
he
was
besieged
by
british
and
canadians
under
proctor
and
indians
under
tecumseh
a
force
of
kentucky
militia
advanced
to
his
relief
and
tried
to
cut
its
way
into
the
fort
while
the
garrison
made
a
sortie
the
sortie
was
fairly
successful
but
the
kentuckians
were
scattered
like
chaff
by
the
british
regulars
in
the
open
and
when
broken
were
cut
to
pieces
by
the
indians
in
the
woods
nearly
two
thirds
of
the
relieving
troops
were

got
into
the
fort
soon
afterward
proctor
abandoned
the
siege
fort
stephenson
garrisoned
by
major
croghan
and
men
was
attacked
by
a
force
of
british
regulars
who
tried
to
carry
it
by
assault
and
were
repulsed
with
the
loss
of
a
fourth
of
their
number
some
four
thousand
indians
joined
proctor
but
most
of
them
left
him
after
perry
victory
on
lake
erie
then
harrison
having
received
large
reinforcements
invaded
canada
at
the
river
thames
his
army
of
men
encountered
and
routed
between
and
british
under
proctor
and
about
indians
under
tecumseh
the
battle
was
decided
at
once
by
a
charge
of
the
kentucky
mounted
riflemen
who
broke
through
the
regulars
took
them
in
rear
and
captured
them
and
then
dismounting
attacked
the
flank
of
the
indians
who
were
also
assailed
by
the
infantry
proctor
escaped
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
and
tecumseh
died
fighting
like
the
hero
that
he
was
this
battle
ended
the
campaign
in
the
northwest
in
this
quarter
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
war
was
on
the
part
of
the
americans
mainly
one
against
indians
the
latter
always
forming
over
half
of
the
british
forces
many
of
the
remainder
were
french
canadians
and
the
others
were
regulars
the
american
armies
on
the
contrary
were
composed
of
the
armed
settlers
of
kentucky
and
ohio
native
americans
of
english
speech
and
blood
who
were
battling
for
lands
that
were
to
form
the
heritage
of
their
children
in
the
west
the
war
was
only
the
closing
act
of
the
struggle
that
for
many
years
had
been
waged
by
the
hardy
and
restless
pioneers
of
our
race
as
with
rifle
and
axe
they
carved
out
the
mighty
empire
that
we
their
children
inherit
it
was
but
the
final
effort
with
which
they
wrested
from
the
indian
lords
of
the
soil
the
wide
and
fair
domain
that
now
forms
the
heart
of
our
great
republic
it
was
the
breaking
down
of
the
last
barrier
that
stayed
the
flood
of
our
civilization
it
settled
once
and
for
ever
that
henceforth
the
law
the
tongue
and
the
blood
of
the
land
should
be
neither
indian
nor
yet
french
but
english
the
few
french
of
the
west
were
fighting
against
a
race
that
was
to
leave
as
little
trace
of
them
as
of
the
doomed
indian
peoples
with
whom
they
made
common
cause
the
presence
of
the
british
mercenaries
did
not
alter
the
character
of
the
contest
it
merely
served
to
show
the
bitter
and
narrow
hatred
with
which
the
regarded
her
greater
daughter
predestined
as
the
latter
was
to
be
queen
of
the
lands
that
lay
beyond
the
atlantic
meanwhile
on
lake
ontario
the
americans
made
successful
descents
on
york
and
fort
george
scattering
or
capturing
their
comparatively
small
garrisons
while
a
counter
descent
by
the
british
on
harbor
failed
the
attacking
force
being
too
small
after
the
capture
of
fort
george
the
americans
invaded
canada
but
their
advance
guard
strong
under
generals
chandler
and
winder
was
surprised
in
the
night
by
british
who
advancing
with
the
bayonet
broke
up
the
camp
capturing
both
the
generals
and
half
the
artillery
though
the
assailants
who
lost
of
their
small
number
suffered
much
more
than
the
americans
yet
the
latter
were
completely
demoralized
and
at
once
retreated
to
fort
george
soon
afterward
boerstler
with
about
men
surrendered
with
shamefully
brief
resistance
to
a
somewhat
smaller
force
of
british
and
indians
then
about
british
crossed
the
niagara
to
attack
black
rock
which
they
took
but
were
afterward
driven
off
by
a
large
body
of
militia
with
the
loss
of
men
later
in
the
season
the
american
general
mcclure
wantonly
burned
the
village
of
newark
and
then
retreated
in
panic
flight
across
the
niagara
in
retaliation
the
british
in
turn
crossed
the
river
regulars
surprised
and
captured
in
the
night
fort
niagara
with
its
garrison
of
men
two
thousand
troops
attacked
black
rock
and
after
losing
over
a
hundred
men
in
a
smart
engagement
with
somewhat
over
militia
whom
they
easily
dispersed
captured
and
burned
both
it
and
buffalo
before
these
last
events
took
place
another
invasion
of
canada
had
been
attempted
this
time
under
general
wilkinson
an
unprincipled
imbecile
as
scott
very
properly
styled
him
it
was
mismanaged
in
every
possible
way
and
was
a
total
failure
it
was
attended
with
but
one
battle
that
of
farm
in
which
british
with
the
loss
of
less
than
men
beat
back
double
their
number
of
americans
who
lost
nearly
men
and
also
one
piece
of
artillery
the
american
army
near
lake
champlain
had
done
nothing
its
commander
general
wade
hampton
being
if
possible
even
more
incompetent
than
wilkinson
he
remained
stationary
while
a
small
force
of
british
plundered
plattsburg
and
burlington
then
with
men
he
crossed
into
canada
but
returned
almost
immediately
after
a
small
skirmish
at
chauteaugay
between
his
advance
guard
and
some
canadians
in
which
the
former
lost
and
the
latter
men
this
affair
in
which
hardly
a
tenth
of
the
american
force
was
engaged
has
been
absurdly
enough
designated
a
battle
by
most
british
and
canadian
historians
in
reality
it
was
the
incompetency
of
their
general
and
not
the
valor
of
their
foes
that
caused
the
retreat
of
the
americans
the
same
comment
by
the
way
applies
to
the
battle
of
plattsburg
in
the
following
year
which
may
have
been
lost
by
sir
george
prevost
but
was
certainly
not
won
by
the
americans
and
again
a
similar
criticism
should
be
passed
on
general
wilkinson
attack
on
la
colle
mill
near
the
head
of
the
same
lake
neither
one
of
the
three
affairs
was
a
fight
in
each
a
greatly
superior
force
led
by
an
utterly
incapable
general
retreated
after
a
slight
skirmish
with
an
enemy
whose
rout
would
have
been
a
matter
of
certainty
had
the
engagement
been
permitted
to
grow
serious
in
the
early
spring
of
a
small
force
of
american
regulars
under
captain
holmes
fighting
from
behind
felled
logs
routed
british
with
a
loss
of
men
they
themselves
losing
but
on
lake
ontario
the
british
made
a
descent
on
oswego
and
took
it
by
fair
assault
and
afterward
lost
men
who
tried
to
cut
out
some
american
transports
and
were
killed
or
captured
to
a
man
all
through
the
spring
and
early
summer
the
army
on
the
niagara
frontier
was
carefully
drilled
by
brown
and
more
especially
by
scott
and
the
results
of
this
drilling
were
seen
in
the
immensely
improved
effectiveness
of
the
soldiers
in
the
campaign
that
opened
in
july
fort
erie
was
captured
with
little
resistance
and
on
the
of
july
at
the
river
chippeway
brown
with
two
brigades
of
regulars
each
about
strong
under
scott
and
ripley
and
a
brigade
of
militia
and
indians
under
porter
making
a
total
of
about
men
won
a
fight
against
the
british
general
riall
who
had
nearly
men
of
them
regulars
porter
brigade
opened
by
driving
in
the
canadian
militia
and
the
indians
but
was
itself
checked
by
the
british
ripley
brigade
took
very
little
part
in
the
battle
three
of
the
regiments
not
being
engaged
at
all
and
the
fourth
so
slightly
as
to
lose
but
five
men
the
entire
brunt
of
the
action
was
borne
by
scott
brigade
which
was
fiercely
attacked
by
the
bulk
of
the
british
regulars
under
riall
the
latter
advanced
with
great
bravery
but
were
terribly
cut
up
by
the
fire
of
scott
regulars
and
when
they
had
come
nearly
up
to
him
scott
charged
with
the
bayonet
and
drove
them
clean
off
the
field
the
american
loss
was
including
indians
the
british
loss
was
excluding
that
of
the
indians
the
number
of
americans
actually
engaged
did
not
exceed
that
of
the
british
and
scott
brigade
in
fair
fight
closed
by
a
bayonet
charge
defeated
an
equal
force
of
british
regulars
on
july
occurred
the
battle
of
niagara
or
lundy
lane
fought
between
general
brown
with
footnote
as
near
as
can
be
found
out
most
american
authorities
make
it
much
less
lossing
for
example
says
only
americans
and
general
drummond
with
footnote
general
drummond
in
his
official
letter
makes
it
but
james
who
gives
the
details
makes
it
rank
and
file
adding
per
cent
for
the
officers
sergeants
and
drummers
brings
it
up
to
and
we
still
have
to
count
in
the
artillery
drivers
etc
british
it
was
brought
on
by
accident
in
the
evening
and
was
waged
with
obstinate
courage
and
savage
slaughter
till
midnight
on
both
sides
the
forces
straggled
into
action
by
detachments
the
americans
formed
the
attacking
party
as
before
scott
brigade
bore
the
brunt
of
the
fight
and
over
half
of
his
men
were
killed
or
wounded
he
himself
was
disabled
and
borne
from
the
field
the
struggle
was
of
the
most
desperate
character
the
combatants
showing
a
stubborn
courage
that
could
not
be
surpassed
footnote
general
drummond
writes
in
so
determined
a
manner
were
their
attacks
directed
against
our
guns
that
our
artillerymen
were
bayoneted
while
in
the
act
of
loading
and
the
muzzle
of
the
guns
were
advanced
within
a
few
yards
of
ours
even
james
says
upon
the
whole
however
the
american
troops
fought
bravely
and
the
conduct
of
many
of
the
officers
of
the
artillery
corps
especially
would
have
done
honor
to
any
service
charge
after
charge
was
made
with
the
bayonet
and
the
artillery
was
taken
and
retaken
once
and
again
the
loss
was
nearly
equal
on
the
side
of
the
americans
men
including
generals
brown
and
scott
wounded
and
two
guns
on
that
of
the
british
men
including
general
riall
captured
and
one
gun
each
side
claimed
it
as
a
victory
over
superior
numbers
the
truth
is
beyond
question
that
the
british
had
the
advantage
in
numbers
and
a
still
greater
advantage
in
position
while
it
is
equally
beyond
question
that
it
was
a
defeat
and
not
a
victory
for
the
americans
they
left
the
field
and
retired
in
perfect
order
to
fort
erie
while
the
british
held
the
field
and
the
next
day
pursued
their
foes
having
received
some
reinforcements
general
drummond
now
with
about
men
pushed
forward
to
besiege
fort
erie
in
which
was
the
american
army
some
strong
under
general
gaines
tucker
with
british
regulars
was
sent
across
the
niagara
to
destroy
the
batteries
at
black
rock
but
was
defeated
by
american
regulars
under
major
morgan
fighting
from
behind
a
strong
breastwork
of
felled
trees
with
a
creek
in
front
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
the
british
in
three
columns
advanced
to
storm
the
american
works
but
after
making
a
most
determined
assault
were
beaten
off
the
assailants
lost
men
the
assailed
about
after
this
nothing
was
done
till
when
general
brown
who
had
resumed
command
of
the
american
forces
determined
upon
and
executed
a
sortie
each
side
had
received
reinforcements
the
americans
numbered
over
the
british
nearly
the
fighting
was
severe
the
americans
losing
men
but
their
opponents
lost
men
and
most
of
their
batteries
were
destroyed
each
side
as
usual
claimed
the
victory
but
exactly
as
lane
must
be
accounted
an
american
defeat
as
our
forces
retreated
from
the
ground
so
this
must
be
considered
an
american
victory
for
after
it
the
british
broke
up
camp
and
drew
off
to
chippeway
nothing
more
was
done
and
on
november
the
american
army
recrossed
the
niagara
though
marked
by
some
brilliant
feats
of
arms
this
four
months
invasion
of
canada
like
those
that
had
preceded
it
thus
came
to
nothing
but
at
the
same
time
a
british
invasion
of
the
united
states
was
repulsed
far
more
disgracefully
sir
george
prevost
with
an
army
of
veteran
troops
marched
south
along
the
shores
of
lake
champlain
to
plattsburg
which
was
held
by
general
macomb
with
regulars
and
perhaps
double
that
number
of
nearly
worthless
militia
a
force
that
the
british
could
have
scattered
to
the
winds
though
as
they
were
strongly
posted
not
without
severe
loss
but
the
british
fleet
was
captured
by
commodore
macdonough
in
the
fight
on
the
lake
and
then
sir
george
after
some
heavy
skirmishing
between
the
outposts
of
the
armies
in
which
the
americans
had
the
advantage
fled
precipitately
back
to
canada
all
through
the
war
the
of
the
united
states
had
been
harried
by
small
predatory
excursions
a
part
of
what
is
now
the
state
of
maine
was
conquered
with
little
resistance
and
kept
until
the
close
of
hostilities
and
some
of
the
towns
on
the
shores
of
chesapeake
bay
had
been
plundered
or
burnt
in
august
a
more
serious
invasion
was
planned
and
some
troops
regulars
sailors
and
marines
were
landed
under
the
command
of
general
ross
so
utterly
helpless
was
the
democratic
administration
at
washington
that
during
the
two
years
of
warfare
hardly
any
steps
had
been
taken
to
protect
the
capitol
or
the
country
round
about
what
little
was
done
was
done
entirely
too
late
and
bungled
badly
in
addition
history
has
not
yet
done
justice
to
the
ludicrous
and
painful
folly
and
stupidity
of
which
the
government
founded
by
jefferson
and
carried
on
by
madison
was
guilty
both
in
its
preparations
for
and
in
its
way
of
carrying
on
this
war
nor
is
it
yet
realized
that
the
men
just
mentioned
and
their
associates
are
primarily
responsible
for
the
loss
we
suffered
in
it
and
the
bitter
humiliation
some
of
its
incidents
caused
us
the
small
british
army
marched
at
will
through
virginia
and
maryland
burned
washington
and
finally
retreated
from
before
baltimore
and
reembarked
to
take
part
in
the
expedition
against
new
orleans
twice
at
bladensburg
and
north
point
it
came
in
contact
with
superior
numbers
of
militia
in
fairly
good
position
in
each
case
the
result
was
the
same
after
some
preliminary
skirmishing
manoeuvring
and
volley
firing
the
british
charged
with
the
bayonet
the
rawest
regiments
among
the
american
militia
then
broke
at
once
the
others
kept
pretty
steady
pouring
in
quite
a
destructive
fire
until
the
regulars
had
come
up
close
to
them
when
they
also
fled
the
british
regulars
were
too
heavily
loaded
to
pursue
and
owing
to
their
mode
of
attack
and
the
rapidity
with
which
their
opponents
ran
away
the
loss
of
the
latter
was
in
each
case
very
slight
at
north
point
however
the
militia
being
more
experienced
behaved
better
than
at
bladensburg
in
neither
case
were
the
british
put
to
any
trouble
to
win
their
victory
the
above
is
a
brief
sketch
of
the
campaigns
of
the
war
it
is
not
cheerful
reading
for
an
american
nor
yet
of
interest
to
a
military
student
and
its
lessons
have
been
taught
so
often
by
similar
occurrences
in
other
lands
under
like
circumstances
and
moreover
teach
such
truths
that
they
scarcely
need
to
be
brought
to
the
notice
of
an
historian
but
the
crowning
event
of
the
war
was
the
battle
of
new
orleans
remarkable
in
its
military
aspect
and
a
source
of
pride
to
every
american
it
is
well
worth
a
more
careful
study
and

it

law

that
no

the
one
he
belongs
to

every

may

found
nor
has
any
neutral
nation
such
a
jurisdiction
over
her
merchant
vessels
upon

to
exclude
a
belligerent
nation
from
the
right
of
searching
them
for
contraband
of

for
the
property

persons
of
her
enemies

in
the
exercise

that
right
the
belligerent
should
discover
on
board
of
the

a
subject
who
has
withdrawn
himself
from
his

can

subject
always
a
subject
on
the

maintained
that
any
foreigner

years
residence
within

territory

after
having
complied
with
certain
forms
became

contended

her
war
ships
possessed
the
right
of
searching
all
neutral
vessels
for
the
property
and
persons
of
her
foes
the
united
states
resisting
this
claim
asserted
that
free
bottoms
made
free
goods
and
that
consequently
her
ships
when
on
the
high

should
not
be
molested

no

in
the

produced
endless
difficulties
to
escape
the
or
for
other
reasons
many
british
seamen
took
service
under
the
american
flag
and
if
they
were
demanded
back
it
is
not
likely
that
they
or
their
american
shipmates
had
much
hesitation
in
swearing
either
that
they
were
not
british
at
all
or
else
that
they
had
been
naturalized
as
americans
equally
probable
is
it
that
the
american
were
guilty
of
a
great
deal
of
fraud
and
more
or

thinly

perjury

the
wrongs

the
british
officers
were
themselves
the
judges
as
to
whether
a
seaman
should
be
pronounced
a
native
of
america
or
of
britain
and
there
was
no
appeal
from
their
judgment

our
treatment
of
its
america
citizens
was
scarcely
in
accordance
with
the
national
privileges
to
which
the
young
republic
had
become
entitled
there
were
no
doubt
many
individuals
among
the
american
people
who
caring
little
for
the
federal
government
considered
it
more
profitable
to
break
than
to
keep
the
laws
of
nations
by
aiding
and
supporting
our
enemy
france
and
it
was
against
such
that
the
efforts
of
the
squadron
had
chiefly
been
directed
but
the
way
the
object
was
carried
out
was
scarcely
less
an
infraction
of
those
national
laws
which
we
were
professedly
enforcing
the
practice
of
taking
english
and
american
seamen
out
of
american
ships
without
regard
to
the
safety
of
navigating
them
when
thus
deprived
of
their
hands
has
been
already
mentioned
to
this
may
be
added
the
detention
of
vessels
against
which
nothing
contrary
to
international
neutrality
could
be
established
whereby
their
cargoes
became
damaged
the
compelling
them
on
suspicion
only
to
proceed
to
ports
other
than
those
to
which
they
were
destined
and
generally
treating
them
as
though
they
were
engaged
in
contraband
trade
american
ships
were
not
permitted
to
quit
english
ports
without
giving
security
for
the
discharge
of
their
cargoes

subject
james
footnote
iv

when
by
the
maritime
supremacy
of
england

no

trade

america
proffered
her
services
as
a
neutral
to
trade
for
her
and
american
merchants
and
their
agents
in
the
gains
that
flowed
in
soon
found
a
compensation
for
all
the
perjury
and
fraud
necessary
to
cheat
the
former
out
of
her
belligerent
rights
the
high
commercial
importance
of
the
united
states
thus
obtained
coupled
with
a
similarity
of
language
and
to
a
superficial
observer
a
resemblance
in
person
between
the
natives
of
america
and
great
britain
has
caused
the
former
to
be
the
chief
if
not
the
only
sufferers
by
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
search
chiefly
indebted
for
their
growth
and
prosperity
to
emigration
from
europe
the
united
states
hold
out
every
allurement
to
foreigners
particularly
to
british
seamen
whom
by
a
process
peculiarly
their
own
they
can
naturalize
as
quickly
as
a
dollar
can
exchange
masters

a
blank
form

up
footnote
this
is
an
exaggeration
it
is
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
that
makes
british
naval
officers
when
searching
for
deserters
from
their
service
so
harsh
in
their
scrutiny
and
so
sceptical
of
american
oaths
and
asseverations
the
last
sentence
of
the
foregoing
from
james
is
an
euphemistic
way
of
saying
that
whenever
a
british
commander
short
of
men
came
across
an
american
vessel
he
impressed
all
of
her
crew
that
he
wanted
whether
they
were
citizens
of
the
united
states
or
not
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
the
only
reason
why
great
britain
did
us
more
injury
than
any
other
power
was
because
she
was
better
able
to
do
so
none
of
her
acts
were
more
offensive
than
milan
decree
by
which
it
was
declared
that
any
neutral
vessel
which
permitted
itself
to
be
searched
by
a
british
cruiser
should
be
considered
as
british
and
as
the
lawful
prize
of
any
french
vessel
french
frigates
and
privateers
were
very
apt
to
snap
up
any
american
vessel
they
came
across
and
were
only
withheld
at
all
by
the
memory
of
the
sharp
dressing
they
had
received
in
the
west
indies
during
the
of
what
we
undoubtedly
ought
to
have
done
was
to
have
adopted
the
measure
actually
proposed
in
congress
and
declared
war
on
both
france
and
england
as
it
was
we
chose
as
a
foe
the
one
that
had
done
and
could
still
do
us
the
greatest
injury
the
principles
for
which
the
united
states
contended
in
are
now
universally
accepted
and
those
so
tenaciously
maintained
by
great
britain
find
no
advocates
in
the
civilized
world
that
england
herself
was
afterward
completely
reconciled
to
our
views
was
amply
shown
by
her
intense
indignation
when
commodore
wilkes
in
the
exercise
of
the
right
of
search
for
the
persons
of
the
foes
of
his
country
stopped
the
neutral
british
ship
while
the
applause
with
which
the
act
was
greeted
in
america
proves
pretty
clearly
another
fact
that
we
had
warred
for
the
right
not
because
it
the
right
but
because
it
agreed
with
our
to
do
so
we
were
contending
for
free
trade
and
sailors
rights
meaning
by
the
former
expression
freedom
to
trade
wherever
we
chose
without
hindrance
save
from
the
power
with
whom
we
were
trading
and
by
the
latter
that
a
man
who
happened
to
be
on
the
sea
should
have
the
same
protection
accorded
to
a
man
who
remained
on
land
nominally
neither
of
these
questions
was
settled
by
or
even
alluded
to
in
the
treaty
of
peace
but
the
immense
increase
of
reputation
that
the
navy
acquired
during
the
war
practically
decided
both
points
in
our
favor
our
sailors
had
gained
too
great
a
name
for
any
one
to
molest
them
with
impunity
again
holding
views
on
these
maritime
subjects
so
radically
different
from
each
other
the
two
nations
could
not
but
be
continually
dealing
with
causes
of
quarrel
not
only
did
british
cruisers
molest
our
but
at
length
one
of
them
the
ship
attacked
an
american
frigate
the
when
the
latter
was
so
lumbered
up
that
she
could
not
return
a
shot
killed
or
disabled
some
twenty
of
her
men
and
took
away
four
others
one
briton
and
three
americans
who
were
claimed
as
deserters
for
this
act
an
apology
was
offered
but
it
failed
to
restore
harmony
between
the
two
nations
soon
afterward
another
action
was
fought
the
american
frigate
commodore
rodgers
attacked
the
british
sloop
captain
bingham
and
exchanged
one
or
two
broadsides
with
her
the
frigate
escaping
while
the
sloop
was
nearly
knocked
to
pieces
mutual
recriminations
followed
each
side
insisting
that
the
other
was
the
assailant
when
great
britain
issued
her
orders
in
council
forbidding
our
trading
with
france
we
retaliated
by
passing
an
embargo
act
which
prevented
us
from
trading
at
all
there
could
be
but
one
result
to
such
a
succession
of
incidents
and
that
was
war
accordingly
in
june
war
was
declared
and
as
a
contest
for
the
rights
of
seamen
it
was
largely
waged
on
the
ocean
we
also
had
not
a
little
fighting
to
do
on
land
in
which
as
a
rule
we
came
out
few
or
no
preparations
for
the
war
had
been
made
and
the
result
was
such
as
might
have
been
anticipated
after
dragging
on
through
three
dreary
and
uneventful
years
it
came
to
an
end
in
by
a
peace
which
left
matters
in
almost
precisely
the
state
in
which
the
war
had
found
them
on
land
and
water
the
contest
took
the
form
of
a
succession
of
petty
actions
in
which
the
glory
acquired
by
the
victor
seldom
eclipsed
the
disgrace
incurred
by
the
vanquished
neither
side
succeeded
in
doing
what
it
intended
americans
declared
that
canada
must
and
should
be
conquered
but
the
conquering
came
quite
as
near
being
the
other
way
british
writers
insisted
that
the
american
navy
should
be
swept
from
the
sea
and
during
the
sweeping
process
it
increased
fourfold
when
the
united
states
declared
war
great
britain
was
straining
every
nerve
and
muscle
in
a
death
struggle
with
the
most
formidable
military
despotism
of
modern
times
and
was
obliged
to
entrust
the
defence
of
her
canadian
colonies
to
a
mere
handful
of
regulars
aided
by
the
local
fencibles
but
congress
had
provided
even
fewer
trained
soldiers
and
relied
on
militia
the
latter
chiefly
exercised
their
fighting
abilities
upon
one
another
in
duelling
and
as
a
rule
were
afflicted
with
conscientious
scruples
whenever
it
was
necessary
to
cross
the
frontier
and
attack
the
enemy
accordingly
the
campaign
opened
with
the
bloodless
surrender
of
an
american
general
to
a
much
inferior
british
force
and
the
war
continued
much
as
it
had
begun
we
suffered
disgrace
after
disgrace
while
the
losses
we
inflicted
in
turn
on
great
britain
were
so
slight
as
hardly
to
attract
her
attention
at
last
having
crushed
her
greater
foe
she
turned
to
crush
the
lesser
and
in
her
turn
suffered
ignominious
defeat
by
this
time
events
had
gradually
developed
a
small
number
of
soldiers
on
our
northern
frontier
who
commanded
by
scott
and
brown
were
able
to
contend
on
equal
terms
with
the
veteran
troops
to
whom
they
were
opposed
though
these
formed
part
of
what
was
then
undoubtedly
the
most
formidable
fighting
infantry
any
european
nation
possessed
the
battles
at
this
period
of
the
struggle
were
remarkable
for
the
skill
and
stubborn
courage
with
which
they
were
waged
as
well
as
for
the
heavy
loss
involved
but
the
number
of
combatants
was
so
small
that
in
europe
they
would
have
been
regarded
as
mere
outpost
skirmishes
and
they
wholly
failed
to
attract
any
attention
abroad
in
that
period
of
colossal
armies
when
great
britain
seriously
turned
her
attention
to
her
transatlantic
foe
and
assembled
in
canada
an
army
of
men
at
the
head
of
lake
champlain
congressional
forethought
enabled
it
to
be
opposed
by
soldiers
who
it
is
true
were
as
well
disciplined
as
hardy
and
as
well
commanded
as
any
in
the
world
but
who
were
only
a
few
hundred
strong
backed
by
more
or
less
incompetent
militia
only
macdonough
skill
and
sir
george
prevost
incapacity
saved
us
from
a
serious
disaster
the
reflected
high
honor
on
our
seamen
but
the
retreat
of
the
british
was
due
to
their
commander
and
not
their
antagonists
meanwhile
a
large
british
fleet
in
the
chesapeake
had
not
achieved
much
glory
by
the
destruction
of
local
and
the
burning
of
a
few
farmers
houses
so
an
army
was
landed
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
at
bladensburg
footnote
see
the
capture
of
washington
by
edward
ingraham
philadelphia
the
five
thousand
british
regulars
utterly
worn
out
by
heat
and
fatigue
by
their
mere
appearance
frightened
into
a
panic
double
their
number
of
american
militia
well
posted
but
the
only
success
attained
was
burning
the
public
buildings
of
washington
and
that
result
was
of
dubious
value
baltimore
was
attacked
next
and
the
attack
repulsed
after
the
forts
and
ships
had
shelled
one
another
with
the
slight
results
that
usually
attend
that
spectacular
and
harmless
species
of
warfare
the
close
of
the
contest
was
marked
by
the
extraordinary
battle
of
new
orleans
it
was
a
perfectly
useless
shedding
of
blood
since
peace
had
already
been
declared
there
is
hardly
another
contest
of
modern
times
where
the
defeated
side
suffered
such
frightful
carnage
while
the
victors
came
off
almost
scatheless
it
is
quite
in
accordance
with
the
rest
of
the
war
that
the
militia
hitherto
worse
than
useless
should
on
this
occasion
win
against
great
odds
in
point
of
numbers
and
moreover
that
their
splendid
victory
should
have
been
of
little
consequence
in
its
effects
upon
the
result
on
the
whole
the
contest
by
land
where
we
certainly
ought
to
have
been
successful
reflected
greater
credit
on
our
antagonists
than
upon
us
in
spite
of
the
services
of
scott
brown
and
jackson
our
small
force
of
regulars
and
volunteers
did
excellently
as
for
the
militia
new
orleans
proved
that
they
fight
superbly
and
the
other
battles
that
they
generally
fight
at
all
at
sea
as
will
appear
the
circumstances
were
widely
different
here
we
possessed
a
small
but
highly
effective
force
the
ships
well
built
manned
by
thoroughly
trained
men
and
commanded
by
able
and
experienced
officers
the
deeds
of
our
navy
form
a
part
of
history
over
which
any
american
can
be
pardoned
for
lingering
such
was
the
origin
issue
and
general
character
of
the
war
it
may
now
be
well
to
proceed
to
a
comparison
of
the
authorities
on
the
subject
allusion
has
already
been
made
to
them
in
the
preface
but
a
fuller
reference
seems
to
be
necessary
in
this
connection
at
the
close
of
the
contest
the
large
majority
of
historians
who
wrote
of
it
were
so
bitterly
rancorous
that
their
statements
must
be
received
with
caution
for
the
main
facts
i
have
relied
wherever
it
was
practicable
upon
the
official
letters
of
the
commanding
officers
taking
each
as
authority
for
his
own
force
and
loss
footnote
as
where
broke
states
his
own
force
at
his
antagonists
at
and
the
american
court
of
inquiry
makes
the
numbers
and
i
have
taken
them
as
being
and
respectively
this
is
the
only
just
method
i
take
it
for
granted
that
each
commander
meant
to
tell
the
truth
and
of
course
knew
his
own
force
while
he
might
very
naturally
and
in
perfect
good
faith
exaggerate
his
antagonist
for
all
the
british
victories
we
have
british
official
letters
which
tally
almost
exactly
as
regards
matters
of
and
not
of
with
the
corresponding
american
accounts
for
the
first
year
the
british
also
published
official
accounts
of
their
defeats
which
in
the
cases
of
the
and
i
have
followed
as
closely
as
the
accounts
of
the
american
victors
the
last
british
official
letter
published
announcing
a
defeat
was
that
in
the
case
of
the
and
it
is
the
only
letter
that
i
have
not
strictly
accepted
the
fact
that
no
more
were
published
thereafter
is
of
itself
unfortunate
and
from
the
various
contradictions
it
contains
it
would
appear
to
have
been
tampered
with
the
surgeon
report
accompanying
it
is
certainly
false
subsequent
to
no
letter
of
a
defeated
british
commander
was
published
footnote
except
about
the
battles
on
the
lakes
where
i
have
accordingly
given
the
same
credit
to
the
accounts
both
of
the
british
and
of
the
americans
and
i
have
to
depend
upon
the
various
british
historians
especially
james
of
whom
more
anon
the
american
and
british
historians
from
whom
we
are
thus
at
times
forced
to
draw
our
material
regard
the
war
from
very
different
and
their
accounts
generally
differ
each
writer
naturally
so
colored
the
affair
as
to
have
it
appear
favorable
to
his
own
side
sometimes
this
was
done
intentionally
and
sometimes
not
not
unfrequently
errors
are
made
against
the
historian
own
side
as
when
the
british
author
brenton
says
that
the
british
brig
mounted
instead
of
while
lossing
in
his
of
the
war
of
makes
the
same
mistake
about
the
armament
of
the
american
brig
errors
of
this
description
are
of
course
as
carefully
to
be
guarded
against
as
any
others
mere
hearsay
reports
such
as
it
has
been
said
a
prisoner
on
board
the
opposing
fleet
has
observed
an
american
or
british
newspaper
of
such
and
such
a
date
has
remarked
are
of
course
to
be
rejected
there
is
a
curious
parallelism
in
the
errors
on
both
sides
for
example
the
american
low
writing
in
tells
how
the
captured
the
of
guns
while
the
british
lieutenant
low
writing
in
tells
how
the
captured
the
of
guns
each
records
the
truth
but
not
the
whole
truth
for
although
rating
and
the
victors
carried
respectively
and
guns
of
heavier
metal
than
those
of
their
antagonists
such
errors
are
generally
intentional
similarly
most
american
writers
mention
the
actions
in
which
the
privateers
were
victorious
but
do
not
mention
those
in
which
they
were
defeated
while
the
british
in
turn
record
every
successful
expedition
but
ignore
entirely
those
which
terminated
unfavorably
other
errors
arise
from
honest
ignorance
thus
james
in
speaking
of
the
repulse
of
the
boats
by
the
gives
the
latter
a
crew
of
men
she
had
more
than
this
number
originally
but
only
were
in
her
at
the
time
of
the
attack
so
also
when
the
captain
of
the
writes
that
the
officers
of
the
report
her
loss
at
when
they
really
reported
it
at
or
when
captain
dacres
thought
the
had
lost
about
men
instead
of
the
american
captains
in
recounting
their
engagements
with
the
british
frigates
invariably
greatly
overestimated
the
loss
of
the
latter
so
that
on
both
sides
there
were
some
intentional
misstatements
or
garblings
and
a
much
more
numerous
class
of
simple
blunders
arising
largely
from
an
incapacity
for
seeing
more
than
one
side
of
the
question
among
the
early
british
writers
upon
this
war
the
ablest
was
james
he
devoted
one
work
his
naval
occurrences
entirely
to
it
and
it
occupies
the
largest
part
of
the
sixth
volume
of
his
more
extensive
history
of
the
british
navy

brenton
new
edition
london
wrote
histories
of
the
same
events
about
the
same
time
but
neither
of
these
naval
officers
produced
half
as
valuable
a
work
as
did
the
civilian
james
marshall
wrote
a
dozen
volumes
each
filled
with
several
scores
of
dreary
panegyrics
or
memoirs
of
as
many
different
officers
there
is
no
attempt
at
order
hardly
any
thing
about
the
ships
guns
or
composition
of
the
crews
and
not
even
the
pretence
of
giving
both
sides
the
object
being
to
make
every
englishman
appear
in
his
best
light
the
work
is
analogous
to
the
numerous
lives
of
decatur
bainbridge
porter
that
appeared
in
the
united
states
about
the
same
time
and
is
quite
as
untrustworthy
brenton
made
a
far
better
and
very
interesting
book
written
on
a
good
and
plan
and
apparently
with
a
sincere
desire
to
tell
the
truth
he
accepts
the
british
official
accounts
as
needing
nothing
whatever
to
supplement
them
precisely
as
cooper
accepts
the
american
officials
a
more
serious
fault
is
his
inability
to
be
accurate
that
this
inaccuracy
is
not
intentional
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
it
tells
as
often
against
his
own
side
as
against
his
opponents
he
says
for
example
that
the
guns
of
perry
and
barclay
squadrons
were
about
equal
in
number
and
weight
that
the
british
was
armed
with
instead
of
and
underestimates
the
force
of
the
second
but
the
blunders
are
quite
as
bad
when
distributed
as
when
confined
to
one
side
in
addition
brenton
disregard
of
all
details
makes
him
of
but
little
use
james
as
already
said
is
by
far
the
most
valuable
authority
on
the
war
as
regards
affairs
he
enters
minutely
into
details
and
has
evidently
laboriously
hunted
up
his
authorities
he
has
examined
the
ships
logs
the
admiralty
reports
various
treatises
all
the
reports
gives
very
extracts
has
arranged
his
work
in
chronological
order
discriminates
between
the
officers
that
deserve
praise
and
those
that
deserve
blame
and
in
fact
writes
a
work
which
ought
to
be
consulted
by
every
student
of
naval
affairs
but
he
is
unfortunately
afflicted
with
a
hatred
toward
the
americans
that
amounts
to
a
monomania
he
wishes
to
make
out
as
strong
a
case
as
possible
against
them
the
of
his
work
may
be
gathered
from
the
not
over
complimentary
account
of
the
education
of
the
youthful
seafaring
american
which
can
be
found
in
vol
vi
of
his
history
on
page
he
asserts
that
he
is
an
impartial
historian
and
about
three
lines
before
mentions
that
it
may
suit
the
americans
to
invent
any
falsehood
no
matter
how
barefaced
to
foist
a
valiant
character
on
themselves
on
page
he
says
that
captain
porter
is
to
be
believed
so
far
as
is
borne
out
by
proof
the
only
safe
way
where
an
american
is
concerned
which
somewhat
sweeping
denunciation
of
the
veracity
of
all
of
captain
porter
compatriots
would
seem
to
indicate
that
james
was
not
perhaps
in
that
dispassionate
frame
of
mind
best
suited
for
writing
history
that
he
should
be
biassed
against
individual
captains
can
be
understood
but
when
he
makes
rabid
onslaughts
upon
the
american
people
as
a
whole
he
renders
it
difficult
for
an
american
at
any
rate
to
put
implicit
credence
in
him
his
statements
are
all
the
harder
to
confute
when
they
are
erroneous
because
they
are
intentionally
so
it
is
not
as
with
brenton
and
marshall
because
he
really
thinks
a
british
captain
be
beaten
except
by
some
kind
of
distorted
special
providence
for
no
man
says
worse
things
than
he
does
about
certain
officers
and
crews
a
writer
of
james
undoubted
ability
must
have
known
perfectly
well
that
his
statements
were
untrue
in
many
instances
as
where
he
garbles
hilyar
account
of
loss
or
misstates
the
comparative
force
of
the
fleets
on
lake
champlain
when
he
says
that
captain
bainbridge
wished
to
run
away
from
the
and
would
have
done
so
if
he
had
not
been
withheld
by
the
advice
of
his
first
lieutenant
who
was
a
renegade
englishman
footnote
who
by
the
way
was
parker
born
in
virginia
and
never
in
england
in
his
life
it
is
not
of
much
consequence
whether
his
making
the
statement
was
due
to
excessive
credulity
or
petty
meanness
for
in
either
case
whether
the
defect
was
in
his
mind
or
his
morals
it
is
enough
to
greatly
impair
the
value
of
his
other
facts
again
when
james
states
that
decatur
ran
away
from
the
until
by
some
marvellous
optical
delusion
he
mistook
her
for
a
he
merely
detracts
a
good
deal
from
the
worth
of
his
own
account
when
the
americans
adopt
boarding
helmets
he
considers
it
as
proving
conclusively
that
they
are
suffering
from
an
acute
attack
of
cowardice
on
he
says
that
had
the
when
she
fell
in
with
the
been
cruising
alone
commodore
rodgers
would
have
magnified
the
british
frigate
into
a
ship
and
have
done
his
utmost
to
avoid
her
which
gives
an
excellent
idea
of
the
weight
to
be
attached
to
the
various
other
anecdotes
he
relates
of
the
commodore
rodgers
but
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
untrustworthy
as
james
is
in
any
thing
referring
purely
to
the
americans
he
is
no
worse
than
his
compeers
of
both
nationalities
the
misstatements
of
niles
in
his
weekly
register
about
the
british
are
quite
as
flagrant
and
his
information
about
his
own
side
even
more
valuable
footnote
in
niles
by
the
way
can
be
found
excellent
examples
of
the
traditional
american
style
in
one
place
i
remember
his
describing
the
immortal
rodgers
baulked
of
his
natural
prey
the
british
as
soaring
about
like
the
bold
bald
eagle
of
his
native
land
seeking
whom
he
might
devour
the
accounts
he
gives
of
british
ships
fleeing
from
american
quite
match
james
anecdotes
of
the
latter
avoidance
of
british
and
for
fear
they
might
mount
the
two
works
taken
together
give
a
very
good
idea
of
the
war
separately
either
is
utterly
unreliable
especially
in
matters
of
opinion
every
little
american
author
crowed
over
perry
nelsonic
victory
over
a
greatly
superior
force
the
was
declared
to
have
been
at
a
disadvantage
when
she
fought
the
and
so
on
but
these
writers
have
all
faded
into
oblivion
and
their
writings
are
not
even
referred
to
much
less
believed
james
on
the
contrary
has
passed
through
edition
after
edition
is
considered
as
unquestionable
authority
in
his
own
country
and
largely
throughout
europe
and
has
furnished
the
basis
for
every
subsequent
account
by
british
authors
from
alison
to
lieutenant
low
almost
every
english
work
whether
of
a
popular
character
or
not
is
in
so
far
as
it
touches
on
the
war
simply
a
rehash
of
the
works
written
by
james
the
consequence
is
that
the
british
and
american
accounts
have
astonishingly
little
resemblance
one
ascribes
the
capture
of
the
british
frigates
simply
to
the
fact
that
their
opponents
were
cut
down
ships
the
other
gives
all
the
glory
to
the
undaunted
heroism
of
the
yankee
sailors
one
not
very
creditable
trait
of
the
early
american
naval
historians
gave
their
rivals
a
great
advantage
the
object
of
the
former
was
to
make
out
that
the
for
example
won
her
victories
against
an
equal
foe
and
an
exact
statement
of
the
forces
showed
the
contrary
so
they
always
avoided
figures
and
thus
left
the
ground
clear
for
james
careful
misstatements
even
when
they
criticised
him
they
never
went
into
details
confining
themselves
to
some
remark
about
hurling
his
figures
in
his
face
with
loathing
even
cooper
interesting
though
his
work
is
has
gone
far
less
into
figures
than
he
should
and
seems
to
have
paid
little
if
any
attention
to
the
british
official
statements
which
of
course
should
be
received
as
of
equal
weight
with
the
american
his
comments
on
the
actions
are
generally
very
fair
the
book
never
being
disfigured
by
bitterness
toward
the
british
but
he
is
certainly
wrong
for
example
in
ascribing
the
loss
of
the
solely
to
accident
that
of
the
solely
to
her
inferiority
in
force
and
so
on
his
disposition
to
praise
the
american
commanders
may
be
generous
but
is
nevertheless
unjust
if
decatur
surrender
of
the
is
at
least
impliedly
praised
then
porter
defence
of
the
can
hardly
receive
its
just
award
there
is
no
weight
in
the
commendation
bestowed
upon
hull
if
commendation
the
same
in
kind
though
less
in
degree
is
bestowed
upon
rodgers
it
is
a
great
pity
that
cooper
did
not
write
a
criticism
on
james
for
no
one
could
have
done
it
more
thoroughly
but
he
never
mentions
him
except
once
in
speaking
of
barclay
fleet
in
all
probability
this
silence
arose
from
sheer
contempt
and
the
certainty
that
most
of
james
remarks
were
false
but
the
effect
was
that
very
many
foreigners
believe
him
to
have
shirked
the
subject
he
rarely
gives
any
data
by
which
the
statements
of
james
can
be
disproved
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
i
have
been
obliged
to
criticise
the
latter
work
very
fully
many
of
james
remarks
however
defy
criticism
from
their
random
nature
as
when
he
states
that
american
midshipmen
were
chiefly
masters
and
mates
of
merchantmen
and
does
not
give
a
single
proof
to
support
the
assertion
it
would
be
nearly
as
true
to
assert
that
the
british
midshipmen
were
for
the
most
part
of
the
and
as
much
labor
would
be
needed
to
disprove
it
in
other
instances
it
is
quite
enough
to
let
his
words
speak
for
themselves
as
where
he
says
that
of
the
american
sailors
one
third
in
number
and
one
half
in
point
of
effectiveness
were
in
reality
british
that
is
of
the
men
the
had
when
she
fought
the
were
british
and
the
remaining
could
have
been
as
effectively
replaced
by
more
british
so
a
very
little
logic
works
out
a
result
that
james
certainly
did
not
intend
to
arrive
at
namely
that
british
led
by
american
officers
could
beat
with
ease
and
comparative
impunity
british
led
by
their
own
officers
he
also
forgets
that
the
whole
consists
of
the
sum
of
the
parts
he
accounts
for
the
victories
of
the
americans
by
stating
that
they
were
lucky
enough
to
meet
with
frigates
and
brigs
who
had
unskilful
gunners
or
worthless
crews
he
also
carefully
shows
that
the
was
incompetently
handled
the
commanded
by
a
mere
martinet
the
crew
unpractised
weak
and
unskilful
the
exceedingly
poor
and
more
to
the
same
effect
now
the
americans
took
in
single
fight
three
frigates
and
seven
sloops
and
when
as
many
as
ten
vessels
are
met
it
is
exceedingly
probable
that
they
represent
the
fair
average
so
that
james
strictures
so
far
as
true
simply
show
that
the
average
british
ship
was
very
apt
to
possess
comparatively
speaking
an
incompetent
captain
or
unskilful
crew
these
disadvantages
were
not
felt
when
opposed
to
navies
in
which
they
existed
to
an
even
greater
extent
but
became
very
apparent
when
brought
into
contact
with
a
power
whose
few
officers
knew
how
to
play
their
own
parts
very
nearly
to
perfection
and
something
equally
important
knew
how
to
make
crews
out
of
what
was
already
good
raw
material
finally
a
large
proportion
of
james
abuse
of
the
americans
sufficiently
refutes
itself
and
perhaps
cooper
method
of
contemptuously
disregarding
him
was
the
best
but
no
harm
can
follow
from
devoting
a
little
space
to
commenting
upon
him
much
the
best
american
work
is

unfortunately
it
is
merely
a
mass

excellently
arranged
and
classified

while

invaluable

the
student

not
interesting
to
the
average
reader
almost
all
the
statements
i
have
made
of
the
force

of
the
american

have
whenever

them

was

such
of

as
she
had

alone
still
possessed
fleets
that
could
be
rendered
formidable
and
so
from
the
scheldt
to
toulon
her
harbors
were
watched
and
her
coasts
harried
by
the
blockading
squadrons
of
the
english

the
latter
had
no
fear
of
their
power
being
seriously
assailed
but
their
vast
commerce
and
numerous
colonies
needed
ceaseless
protection
accordingly
in
every
sea
their
cruisers
could
be
found
of
all
sizes
from
the
stately
with
her
tiers
of
heavy
cannon
and
her
many
hundreds
of
men
down
to
the
little
cutter
carrying

a
score
of
souls
and
a
couple
of
light

all
these
cruisers
but
especially
those
of
the
lesser
rates
were
continually
brought
into
contact
with
such
of
the
hostile
vessels
as
had
run
through
the
blockade
or
were
too
small
to
be
affected

it
french
and
italian
frigates
were
often
fought
and
captured
when
they
were
skirting
their
own
coasts
or
had
started
off
on
a
plundering
cruise
through
the
atlantic
or
to
the
indian
ocean
and
though
the
danes
had
lost
their
larger
ships
they
kept
up
a
spirited
warfare
with
brigs
and
so
the
english
marine
was
in
constant
exercise
attended
with
almost
invariable
success
such
was
great
britain
naval
power
when
the
congress
of
the
united
states
declared
war
upon
her
while
she
could
number
her
thousand
sail
the
american
navy
included
but
half
a
dozen
frigates
and
six
or
eight
sloops
and
brigs
and
it
is
small
matter
for
surprise
that
the
british
officers
should
have
regarded
their
new
foe
with
contemptuous
indifference
hitherto
the
american
seamen
had
never
been
heard
of
except
in
connection
with
two
or
three
engagements
with
french
frigates
and
some
obscure
skirmishes
against
the
moors
of
tripoli
none
of
which
could
possibly
attract
attention
in
the
years
that
saw
aboukir
copenhagen
and
trafalgar
and
yet
these
same
petty
wars
were
the
school
which
raised
our
marine
to
the
highest
standard
of
excellence
a
continuous
course
of
victory
won
mainly
by
seamanship
had
made
the
english
sailor
overweeningly
and
caused
him
to
pay
but
little
regard
to
manoeuvring
or
even
to
gunnery
meanwhile
the
american
learned
by
receiving
hard
knocks
how
to
give
them
and
belonged
to
a
service
too
young
to
feel
an
in
itself
one
side
had
let
its
training
relax
while
the
other
had
carried
it
to
the
highest
possible
point
hence
our
ships
proved
on
the
whole
victorious
in
the
apparently
unequal
struggle
and
the
men
who
had
conquered
the
best
seamen
of
europe
were
now
in
turn
obliged
to
succumb
compared
with
the
great
naval
battles
of
the
preceding
few
years
out
bloodiest
conflicts
were
mere
skirmishes
but
they
were
skirmishes
between
the
hitherto
acknowledged
kings
of
the
ocean
and
new
men
who
yet
proved
to
be
more
than
their
equals
for
over
a
hundred
years
or
since
the
time
when
they
had
contended
on
equal
terms
with
the
great
dutch
admirals
the
british
had
shown
a
decided
superiority
to
their
various
foes
and
during
the
latter
quarter
of
the
time
this
superiority
as
already
said
was
very
marked
indeed
in
consequence
the
victories
of
the
new
enemy
attracted
an
amount
of
attention
altogether
disproportionate
to
their
material
effects
and
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
our
little
navy
in
which
the
art
of
handling
and
fighting
the
old
broadside
sailing
frigate
in
single
conflict
was
brought
to
the
highest
point
of
perfection
ever
reached
that
this
same
navy
should
have
contained
the
first
representative
of
the
modern
war
steamer
and
also
the
torpedo
the
two
terrible
engines
which
were
to
drive
from
the
ocean
the
very
whitewinged
craft
that
had
first
won
honor
for
the
starry
flag
the
tactical
skill
of
hull
or
decatur
is
now
of
merely
archaic
interest
and
has
but
little
more
bearing
on
the
manoeuvring
of
a
modern
fleet
than
have
the
tactics
of
the
athenian
gallies
but
the
war
still
conveys
some
most
practical
lessons
as
to
the
value
of
efficient
ships
and
above
all
of
efficient
men
in
them
had
we
only
possessed
the
miserable
our
men
could
have
done
nothing
had
we
not
possessed
good
men
the
heavy
frigates
would
have
availed
as
little
poor
ships
and
impotent
artillery
had
lost
the
dutch
almost
their
entire
navy
fine
ships
and
heavy
cannon
had
not
saved
the
french
and
spanish
from
the
like
fate
we
owed
our
success
to
putting
sailors
even
better
than
the
dutch
on
ships
even
finer
than
those
built
by
the
two
latin
seaboard
powers
the
first
point
to
be
remembered
in
order
to
write
a
fair
account
of
this
war
is
that
the
difference
in
fighting
skill
which
certainly
existed
between
the
two
parties
was
due
mainly
to
training
and
not
to
the
nature
of
the
men
it
seems
certain
that
the
american
had
in
the
beginning
somewhat
the
advantage
because
his
surroundings
partly
physical
and
partly
social
and
political
had
forced
him
into
habits
of
greater
therefore
on
the
average
he
offered
rather
the
best
material
to
start
with
but
the
difference
was
very
slight
and
totally
disappeared
under
good
training
the
combatants
were
men
of
the
same
race
differing
but
little
from
one
another
on
the
new
england
coast
the
english
blood
was
as
pure
as
in
any
part
of
britain
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
it
was
mixed
with
that
of
the
dutch
settlers
and
the
dutch
are
by
race
nearer
to
the
true
old
english
of
alfred
and
harold
than
are
for
example
the
thoroughly
anglicized
welsh
of
cornwall
otherwise
the
infusion
of
new
blood
into
the
english
race
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
has
been
chiefly
from
three
sources
german
irish
and
norse
and
these
three
sources
represent
the
elemental
parts
of
the
composite
english
stock
in
about
the
same
proportions
in
which
they
were
originally
combined
mainly
teutonic
largely
celtic
and
with
a
scandinavian
admixture
the
descendant
of
the
german
becomes
as
much
an
as
the
descendant
of
the
strathclyde
celt
has
already
become
an
looking
through
names
of
the
combatants
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
any
of
one
navy
that
could
not
be
matched
in
the
other
hull
or
lawrence
allen
perry
or
stewart
and
among
all
the
english
names
on
both
sides
will
be
found
many
scotch
irish
or
welsh
macdonough
or
jones
still
stranger
ones
appear
the
huguenot
tattnall
is
one
among
the
american
defenders
of
the
and
another
huguenot
tattnall
is
among
the
british
assailants
at
lake
borgne
it
must
always
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
americans
and
the
british
are
two
substantially
similar
branches
of
the
great
english
race
which
both
before
and
after
their
separation
have
assimilated
and
made
englishmen
of
many
other
peoples
footnote
the
inhabitants
of
great
britain
are
best
designated
as
british
english
being
either
too
narrow
or
too
broad
a
term
in
one
case
meaning
the
inhabitants
of
but
a
part
of
britain
and
in
the
other
the
whole
people
the
lessons
taught
by
the
war
can
hardly
be
learned
unless
this
identity
is
kept
in
mind
footnote
it
was
practically
a
civil
war
and
was
waged
with
much
harshness
and
bitterness
on
both
sides
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
numerous
grievances
of
the
americans
the
british
in
turn
looked
upon
our
which
entered
the
french
ports
exactly
as
we
regarded
at
a
later
date
the
british
steamers
that
ran
into
wilmington
and
charleston
it
is
curious
to
see
how
illogical
writers
are
the
careers
of
the
and
for
example
were
strikingly
similar
in
many
ways
yet
the
same
writer
who
speaks
of
one
as
an
heroic
little
brig
will
call
the
other
a
black
pirate
of
course
there
can
be
no
possible
comparison
as
to
the
causes
for
which
the
two
vessels
were
fighting
but
the
cruises
themselves
were
very
much
alike
both
in
character
and
history
to
understand
aright
the
efficiency
of
our
navy
it
is
necessary
to
take
a
brief
look
at
the
character
and
antecedents
of
the
officers
and
men
who
served
in
it
when
war
broke
out
the
united
states
navy
was
but
a
few
years
old
yet
it
already
had
a
far
from
dishonorable
history
the
captains
and
lieutenants
of
had
been
taught
their
duties
in
a
very
practical
school
and
the
flag
under
which
they
fought
was
endeared
to
them
already
by
not
a
few
glorious
traditions
though
these
perhaps
like
others
of
their
kind
had
lost
none
of
their
glory
in
the
telling
a
few
of
the
older
men
had
served
in
the
war
of
the
revolution
and
all
still
kept
fresh
in
mind
the
doughty
deeds
of
the
privateering
war
craft
men
still
talked
of
daring
cruises
and
barney
stubborn
fights
or
told
of
scotch
paul
and
the
grim
work
they
had
who
followed
his
fortunes
besides
these
memories
of
an
older
generation
most
of
the
officers
had
themselves
taken
part
when
younger
in
years
and
rank
in
deeds
not
a
whit
less
glorious
almost
every
man
had
had
a
share
in
some
gallant
feat
to
which
he
in
part
at
least
owed
his
present
position
the
captain
had
perhaps
been
a
midshipman
under
truxtun
when
he
took
the
and
had
been
sent
aboard
the
captured
french
frigate
with
the
the
lieutenant
had
borne
a
part
in
the
various
attacks
on
tripoli
and
had
led
his
men
in
the
desperate
fights
in
which
the
yankee
cutlass
proved
an
overmatch
for
the
turkish
and
moorish
scimitars
nearly
every
senior
officer
had
extricated
himself
by
his
own
prowess
or
skill
from
the
dangers
of
battle
or
storm
he
owed
his
rank
to
the
fact
that
he
had
proved
worthy
of
it
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
he
had
learned
he
was
a
practical
seaman
and
prided
himself
on
the
way
his
vessel
was
handled
having
reached
his
rank
by
hard
work
and
knowing
what
real
fighting
meant
he
was
careful
to
see
that
his
men
were
trained
in
the
of
discipline
and
that
they
knew
how
to
handle
the
guns
in
battle
as
well
as
polish
them
in
peace
beyond
almost
any
of
his
countrymen
he
worshipped
the
gridiron
flag
and
having
been
brought
up
in
the
navy
regarded
its
honor
as
his
own
it
was
perhaps
the
navy
alone
that
thought
itself
a
match
ship
against
ship
for
great
britain
the
remainder
of
the
nation
pinned
its
faith
to
the
army
or
rather
to
that
weakest
of
weak
reeds
the
militia
the
officers
of
the
navy
with
their
strong
de
corps
their
jealousy
of
their
own
name
and
record
and
the
knowledge
by
actual
experience
that
the
british
ships
sailed
no
faster
and
were
no
better
handled
than
their
own
had
no
desire
to
shirk
a
conflict
with
any
foe
and
having
tried
their
bravery
in
actual
service
they
made
it
doubly
formidable
by
cool
wary
skill
even
the
younger
men
who
had
never
been
in
action
had
been
so
well
trained
by
the
tried
veterans
over
them
that
the
lack
of
experience
was
not
sensibly
felt
the
sailors
comprising
the
crews
of
our
ships
were
well
worthy
of
their
leaders
there
was
no
better
seaman
in
the
world
than
american
jack
he
had
been
bred
to
his
work
from
infancy
and
had
been
off
in
a
fishing
dory
almost
as
soon
as
he
could
walk
when
he
grew
older
he
shipped
on
a
or
whaler
and
in
those
warlike
times
when
our
large
was
compelled
to
rely
pretty
much
on
itself
for
protection
each
craft
to
be
well
handled
all
who
were
not
were
soon
weeded
out
by
a
process
of
natural
selection
of
which
the
agents
were
french
picaroons
spanish
buccaneers
and
malay
pirates
it
was
a
rough
school
but
it
taught
jack
to
be
both
skilful
and
and
he
was
all
the
better
fitted
to
become
a
man
because
he
knew
more
about
than
most
of
his
kind
in
foreign
lands
at
home
he
had
used
his
ponderous
ducking
gun
with
good
effect
on
the
flocks
of
canvasbacks
in
the
reedy
flats
of
the
chesapeake
or
among
the
in
the
rough
water
off
the
new
england
cliffs
and
when
he
went
on
a
sailing
voyage
the
chances
were
even
that
there
would
be
some
use
for
the
long
guns
before
he
returned
for
the
american
merchant
sailor
could
trust
to
no
armed
escort
the
wonderful
effectiveness
of
our
seamen
at
the
date
of
which
i
am
writing
as
well
as
long
subsequently
to
it
was
largely
due
to
the
curious
condition
of
things
in
europe
for
thirty
years
all
the
european
nations
had
been
in
a
state
of
continuous
and
very
complicated
warfare
during
the
course
of
which
each
nation
in
turn
fought
almost
every
other
england
being
usually
at
loggerheads
with
all
one
effect
of
this
was
to
force
an
enormous
proportion
of
the
carrying
trade
of
the
world
into
american
bottoms
the
old
massachusetts
town
of
salem
was
then
one
of
the
main
depots
of
the
east
india
trade
the
baltimore
clippers
carried
goods
into
the
french
and
german
ports
with
small
regard
to
the
blockade
new
bedford
and
sag
harbor
fitted
out
whalers
for
the
arctic
seas
as
well
as
for
the
south
pacific
the
rich
merchants
of
philadelphia
and
new
york
sent
their
ships
to
all
parts
of
the
world
and
every
small
port
had
some
craft
in
the
coasting
trade
on
the
new
england
seaboard
but
few
of
the
boys
would
reach
manhood
without
having
made
at
least
one
voyage
to
the
newfoundland
banks
after
codfish
and
in
the
whaling
towns
of
long
island
it
used
to
be
an
old
saying
that
no
man
could
marry
till
he
struck
his
whale
the
wealthy
merchants
of
the
large
cities
would
often
send
their
sons
on
a
voyage
or
two
before
they
let
them
enter
their
thus
it
came
about
that
a
large
portion
of
our
population
was
engaged
in
seafaring
pursuits
of
a
nature
strongly
tending
to
develop
a
resolute
and
hardy
character
in
the
men
that
followed
them
the
british
sailed
in
huge
convoys
guarded
by
while
as
said
before
our
vessels
went
alone
and
relied
for
protection
on
themselves
if
a
fishing
smack
went
to
the
banks
it
knew
that
it
ran
a
chance
of
falling
in
with
some
not
nova
scotian
privateer
the
barques
that
sailed
from
salem
to
the
spice
islands
kept
their
men
well
trained
both
at
great
guns
and
musketry
so
as
to
be
able
to
beat
off
either
malay
proas
or
chinese
junks
the
new
york
ships
loaded
for
the
west
indies
were
prepared
to
do
battle
with
the
picaroons
that
swarmed
in
the
spanish
main
while
the
fast
craft
from
baltimore
could
fight
as
well
as
they
could
run
wherever
an
american
seaman
went
he
not
only
had
to
contend
with
all
the
legitimate
perils
of
the
sea
but
he
had
also
to
regard
almost
every
stranger
as
a
foe
whether
this
foe
called
himself
pirate
or
privateer
mattered
but
little
french
spaniards
algerines
malays
from
all
alike
our
commerce
suffered
and
against
all
our
merchants
were
forced
to
defend
themselves
the
effect
of
such
a
state
of
things
which
made
commerce
so
remunerative
that
the
bolder
spirits
could
hardly
keep
out
of
it
and
so
hazardous
that
only
the
most
skilful
and
daring
could
succeed
in
it
was
to
raise
up
as
fine
a
set
of
seamen
as
ever
manned
a
navy
the
stern
school
in
which
the
american
was
brought
up
forced
him
into
habits
of
independent
thought
and
action
which
it
was
impossible
that
the
more
protected
briton
could
possess
he
worked
more
intelligently
and
less
from
routine
and
while
perfectly
obedient
and
amenable
to
discipline
was
yet
able
to
judge
for
himself
in
an
emergency
he
was
more
easily
managed
than
most
of
his
kind
being
shrewd
quiet
and
in
fact
comparatively
speaking
rather
moral
than
otherwise
if
he
was
a
new
englander
when
he
retired
from
a
sea
life
he
was
not
unapt
to
end
his
days
as
a
deacon
altogether
there
could
not
have
been
better
material
for
a
fighting
crew
than
cool
gritty
american
jack
moreover
there
was
a
good
nucleus
of
veterans
to
begin
with
who
were
well
fitted
to
fill
the
more
responsible
positions
such
as
captains
of
guns
etc
these
were
men
who
had
cruised
in
the
little
after
french
privateers
who
had
been
in
the
in
her
two
victorious
fights
or
who
perhaps
had
followed
decatur
when
with
only
eighty
men
he
cut
out
the
manned
by
fivefold
his
force
and
surrounded
by
hostile
batteries
and
war
vessels
one
of
the
boldest
expeditions
of
the
kind
on
record
it
is
to
be
noted
furthermore
in
this
connection
that
by
a
singular
turn
of
fortune
great
britain
whose
system
of
impressing
american
sailors
had
been
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
the
war
herself
became
in
consequence
of
that
very
system
in
some
sort
a
nursery
for
the
seamen
of
the
young
republican
navy
the
american
sailor
feared
nothing
more
than
being
impressed
on
a
british
ship
dreading
beyond
measure
the
hard
life
and
cruel
discipline
aboard
of
her
but
once
there
he
usually
did
well
enough
and
in
course
of
time
often
rose
to
be
of
some
little
consequence
for
years
before
the
number
of
these
impressed
sailors
was
in
reality
greater
than
the
entire
number
serving
in
the
american
navy
from
which
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
they
formed
a
good
stock
to
draw
upon
very
much
to
their
credit
they
never
lost
their
devotion
to
the
home
of
their
birth
more
than
two
thousand
of
them
being
imprisoned
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
because
they
refused
to
serve
against
their
country
when
commodore
decatur
captured
the
that
officer
as
we
learn
from
marshall
naval
biography
ii
stated
that
most
of
the
seamen
of
his
own
frigate
the
had
served
in
british
war
vessels
and
that
some
had
been
with
lord
nelson
in
the
and
had
even
been
bargemen
to
the
great
admiral
a
pretty
sure
proof
that
the
american
sailors
did
not
show
a
disadvantage
when
compared
with
others
footnote
with
perfect
gravity
james
and
his
followers
assume
statement
to
be
equivalent
to
saying
that
he
had
chiefly
british
seamen
on
board
whereas
even
as
quoted
by
marshall
decatur
merely
said
that
his
seamen
had
served
on
board
a
british
and
that
some
had
served
under
lord
nelson
like
the
the
had
rid
herself
of
most
of
the
british
subjects
on
board
before
sailing
decatur
remark
simply
referred
to
the
number
of
his
american
seamen
who
had
been
impressed
on
board
british
ships
whenever
james
says
that
an
american
ship
had
a
large
proportion
of
british
sailors
aboard
the
explanation
is
that
a
large
number
of
the
crew
were
americans
who
had
been
impressed
on
british
ships
it
would
be
no
more
absurd
to
claim
trafalgar
as
an
american
victory
because
there
was
a
certain
number
of
americans
in
nelson
fleet
than
it
is
to
assert
that
the
americans
were
victorious
in
because
there
were
a
few
renegade
british
on
board
their
ships
good
seaman
as
the
impressed
american
proved
to
be
yet
he
seldom
missed
an
opportunity
to
escape
from
the
british
service
by
desertion
or
otherwise
in
the
first
place
the
life
was
very
hard
and
in
the
second
the
american
seaman
was
very
patriotic
he
had
an
honest
and
deep
affection
for
his
own
flag
while
on
the
contrary
he
felt
a
curiously
strong
hatred
for
england
as
distinguished
from
englishmen
this
hatred
was
partly
an
abstract
feeling
cherished
through
a
vague
traditional
respect
for
bunker
hill
and
partly
something
very
real
and
vivid
owing
to
the
injuries
he
and
others
like
him
had
received
whether
he
lived
in
maryland
or
massachusetts
he
certainly
knew
men
whose
ships
had
been
seized
by
british
cruisers
their
goods
confiscated
and
the
vessels
condemned
some
of
his
friends
had
fallen
victims
to
the
odious
right
of
search
and
had
never
been
heard
of
afterward
he
had
suffered
many
an
injury
to
friend
fortune
or
person
and
some
day
he
hoped
to
repay
them
all
and
when
the
war
did
come
he
fought
all
the
better
because
he
knew
it
was
in
his
own
quarrel
but
as
i
have
said
this
hatred
was
against
england
not
against
englishmen
then
as
now
sailors
were
scattered
about
over
the
world
without
any
great
regard
for
nationality
and
the
resulting
intermingling
of
natives
and
foreigners
in
every
mercantile
marine
was
especially
great
in
those
of
britain
and
america
whose
people
spoke
the
same
tongue
and
wore
the
same
aspect
when
chance
drifted
the
american
into
liverpool
or
london
he
was
ready
enough
to
ship
in
an
indiaman
or
whaler
caring
little
for
the
fact
that
he
served
under
the
british
flag
and
the
briton
in
turn
who
found
himself
in
new
york
or
philadelphia
willingly
sailed
in
one
of
the
barques
whether
it
floated
the

the

urging
the
necessity
of

that

hard
work
to
recruit
men
for
vessels

of
the
standard
statements
made
by
the
british
historians
about
this
war
is
that
our
ships
were
mainly
or
largely
manned
by
british
sailors
this
if
true
would
not
interfere
with
the
lessons
which
it
teaches
and
besides
that
it
is
true
in
this
as
in
every
thing
else
all
the
modern
writers
have
merely
followed
james
or
brenton
and
i
shall
accordingly
confine
myself
to
examining
their
assertions
the
former
begins
vol
iv
by
diffidently
stating
that
there
is
a
similarity
of
language
between
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
countries
an
interesting
philological
discovery
that
but
few
will
attempt
to
controvert
in
vol
vi
he
mentions
that
a
number
of
blanks
occur
in
the
american
navy
list
in
the
column
where
born
and
in
proof
of
the
fact
that
these
blanks
are
there
because
the
men
were
not
americans
he
says
that
their
names
are
all
english
and
irish
footnote
for
example
james
writes
out
of
the
captains
one
only
thomas
tingey
had
england
marked
as
his
birthplace
three
blanks
occur
and
we
consider
it
rather
creditable
to
captains
john
shaw
daniel
patterson
and
john
ord
creighton
that
they
were
ashamed
to
tell
where
they
were
born
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
out
the
but
captain
shaw
was
born
in
new
york
and
i
have
seen
captain
patterson
incidentally
alluded
to
as
born
and
bred
in
america
generally
whenever
i
have
been
able
to
fill
up
the
vacancies
in
the
column
where
born
i
have
found
that
it
was
in
america
from
these
facts
it
would
appear
that
james
was
somewhat
hasty
in
concluding
that
the
omission
of
the
proved
the
owner
of
the
name
to
be
a
native
of
great
britain
they
certainly
are
and
so
are
all
the
other
names
in
the
list
it
could
not
well
be
otherwise
as
the
united
states
navy
was
not
officered
by
indians
in
looking
over
this
same
navy
list
of
it
will
be
seen
that
but
a
little
over
per
cent
of
the
officers
were
born
abroad
a
smaller
proportion
by
far
than
would
exist
in
the
population
of
the
country
at
large
and
most
of
these
had
come
to
america
when
under
ten
years
of
age
on
james
adds
that
the
british
sailors
composed
one
third
in
number
and
one
half
in
point
of
effectiveness
of
the
american
crews
brenton
in
his
naval
history

was
said

i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
the
fact

turned
out
to

there
were
certainly
a

number
of
british

but
the
number
probably
did
not
exceed
thirty

these
eleven

would
probably
represent
a
fair
average
this
proportion

be
taken
as
the
proper

james
however
is
of
the
opinion
that
those
ships
manned
by
americans
were
more
apt
to
be
captured
than
those
manned
by
the
braver
british

calls
for
an
examination
of
the

of

says

that
several
of
her
men
were
recognized
as
british
seamen
even
if
this
were
true
several
could
not
probably
mean
more
than
sixteen

per

positively
in

manned
exclusively
by

a

draft

not
a

james
states
that
some
of
her
men
were
natives
of
the
united
kingdom
but
he
gives
no
authority

the
men
he
refers
to
were
in
all
probability
those
spoken
of

as
they
were
afraid
to

that
this
fear
was
justifiable
may
be
seen
by
reading

years
in

that

british
themselves
it
may
be
questioned
whether
decatur
ever
made
such
an
assertion
or
if
he
did
it
is
safe
to
assume
again
that
his
men
were
americans

these

a

small
number
serving
in
our
own

the
enormous
number
impressed
into
the
british
navy
probably
but
one
of
the
former
to
two
of
the
latter
as
already
mentioned
the
american
always
left
a
british
as
soon
as
he
could
by
desertion
or
discharge
but
he
had
no
unwillingness
to
serve
in
the
home
navy
where
the
pay
was
larger
and
the
discipline
far
more
humane
not
to
speak
of
motives
of
patriotism
even
if
the
man
kept
out
of
service
for
some
time
he
would
be
very
apt
to
enlist
when
a
war
broke
out
which
his
country
undertook
largely
to
avenge
his
own
wrongs
of
the
crew
of
men
five
were
british
this
fact
was
not
found
out
till
three
deserted
when
an
investigation
was
made
and
the
two
other
british
discharged
captain
henly
in
reporting
these
facts
made
no
concealment
of
his
surprise
that
there
should
be
any
british
at
all
in
his
crew
footnote
see
his
letter
in
letters
of
masters
commandant
i
no
from
these
facts
and
citations
we
may
accordingly
conclude
that
the
proportion
of
british
seamen
serving
on
american
ships
the
war
broke
varied
between
none
as
on
the
and
to
ten
per
as
on
the
and
on
the
average
nine
tenths
of
each
of
our
crews
were
american
seamen
and
about
one
twentieth
british
the
remainder
being
a
mixture
of
various
nationalities
on
the
other
hand
it
is
to
be
said
that
the
british
frigate
had
ten
americans
among
her
crew
who
were
permitted
to
go
below
during
action
and
the
eight
who
were
not
allowed
that
privilege
three
of
them
being
killed
three
of
the
british
sloop
men
were
americans
who
were
forced
to
fight
against
the
one
of
them
was
killed
two
of
the
men
were
americans
who
were
also
forced
to
fight
when
the
crew
of
the
was
exchanged
a
number
of
other
american
prisoners
were
sent
with
them
among
these
were
a
number
of
american
seamen
who
had
been
serving
in
the
and
various
other
vessels
so
there
was
also
a
certain
proportion
of
americans
among
the
british
crews
although
forming
a
smaller
percentage
of
them
than
the
british
did
on
board
the
american
ships
in
neither
case
was
the
number
sufficient
to
at
all
affect
the
result
the
crews
of
our
ships
being
thus
mainly
native
americans
it
may
be
interesting
to
try
to
find
out
the
proportions
that
were
furnished
by
the
different
sections
of
the
country
there
is
not
much
difficulty
about
the
officers
the
captains

marine

whose
birthplaces

populous
of
all
the

coming
next
four
fifths
of

came

it
is
more
difficult
to
get
at
the
birthplaces
of
the
sailors

a
more
accurate
idea
of
the
quotas
of
sailors
furnished
by
the
different
sections
can
be
arrived
at
by
comparing
the
total
amount
of
tonnage
the
country
possessed
at
the
outbreak

speaking
roughly
per
cent
of
it
belonged
to
new
england
per
cent
to
the
middle
states
and
per
cent
to
maryland
this
makes
it
but
of
course
not
certain
that
three
fourths
of
the
common
sailors
hailed
from
the
northern
states
half
the
remainder
from
maryland
and
the
rest
chiefly
from
virginia
and
south
carolina
having
thus

it

now
be

present

historians
the

in

that
our

most
vessels
of

the
which

so
that
her
real
was
per

in

of
her
nominal
force

this
was
not
as
bad
as
the
british
sloop
which
was

they
captured
mounted
each
guns
so
the
average
was
the
same
later
we
built
sloops
that
rated

mounted
guns

when
one
was
captured
it
was
also
put
down
in
the
british

list
as
an
during
all
the
combats
of

four
vessels
that

as
few

they
rated

british
the

two
american
the

one
navy
was
certainly
as
deceptive
as
another
as
far
as

went
the
force
of
the
statement
that
our
large

a
complete
battery
and
the
an
interrupted
one
mounting
guns
on
the
forecastle
and
at
that
time
all
or
in
reality
and
ships
were
liners
but
in
this
had
changed
somewhat
as
the
various
nations
built
more
and
more
powerful
vessels
the
lower
rates
of
the
different
divisions
were
dropped
thus
the
british
ship
captured
by
the
was
in
reality
a
small
frigate
with
a
battery
of
guns
and
guns
on
the
a
few
years
before
she
would
have
been
called
a
frigate
but
she
then
ranked
merely
as
a
sloop
similarly
the
and
ships
that
had
fought
in
the
line
at
the
doggerbank
camperdown
and
even
at
aboukir
were
now
no
longer
deemed
fit
for
the
purpose
and
the
was
the
lowest
ship
the
and
must
then
be
compared
with
the
existing
european
vessels
that
were
classed
as
frigates
the
french
in
had
no
frigates
for
the
very
good
reason
that
they
had
all
fallen
victims
to
the
english
but
in
july
of
that
year
a
danish
frigate
the
which
carried
long
was
destroyed
by
the
english
ship
the
british
frigates
were
of
several
rates
the
lowest
rated
carrying
in
all
guns
long
on
the
and
carronades
on
the
a
broadside
of
pounds

in
all
these
vessels
there
were
generally
two

substituted
for
the
carronades
the
frigates
like
the
carried
guns
long
on
the
and
carronades
above
the
frigates
like
the

the
frigates
then
presented
in
broadside
long

and
carronades
above
the
frigates
long
below
and
carronades

so
that
a
frigate
would
naturally
present
long
and
carronades
above
as
the
did
at
first
the
rate
was
perfectly
proper
for
french
british
and
danes
already
possessed
frigates
and
there
was
really
less
disparity
between
the
force
and
rate
of
a
that
carried
guns
than
there
was
in
a
that
carried
or
like
the

was
this
all
two
of
our
three
victories
were
won
by
the
which
only
carried
carronades
and
once
and
once
guns
and
as
two
thirds
of
the
work
was
thus
done
by
this
vessel
i
shall
now
compare
her
with
the
largest
british
frigates
her
broadside
force
consisted
of
long
on
the
and
on
the
one
long
and
in
one
case
in
the
other
carronades
a
broadside
of

pounds

nominally
in
reality
about
per

account
of
the
short
weight

the
metal

was
then
in
the
british
navy
the

in
broadside

carronades
when
the
batteries
are
equal
the
addition
of
pounds
to
the
broadside
which
is
all
the
superiority
of
the
over
the
is
certainly
not
enough
to
make
the
distinction
between
a
frigate
and
a
disguised
but
not
considering
the
there
were
in
the
british
navy
three
frigates
the
and
we
only
came
in
contact
with
the
latter
in
when
the
had
but
guns
the
then
had
an
armament
of
long

carronades
making
a
broadside
of
pounds

according
to
james
pounds
he
omits
the
chase
guns
for
no
reason
or
including
a
shifting
carronade
of
pounds
just
or
per

less
than
the
force

that
disguised

the
as

was
in
reality
the
former

not
the
latter

was
underrated
i
have
taken
the
because
the
british
had
more
to
do
with
her
than
they
did
with
our
other
two
taken
together
the
latter
were
both
of
heavier
metal

captured
the

having
substituted
a

her
broadside
amounted
to
pounds

per

and
on
account
of
the
short
weight
of
her
shot
per

excess
over

if
this
difference
made
her
a
ship
then
the
was
doubly
a
ship

to
the

moreover
the
american
commanders
found
their
carronades
too
heavy
as
i
have
said
the
only

the
landed

her
guns
when
in
she
attempted
to

the
blockade

carried

a
broadside
of
pounds
just
per
cent
more
than
the
footnote
it
was
on
account
of
this
difference
of
per
cent
that
captain
hardy
refused
to
allow
the
to
meet
the
james
vi
this
was
during
the
course
of
some
challenges
and
which
ended
in
nothing
decatur
in
his
turn
being
unwilling
to
have
the
meet
the
unless
the
latter
should
agree
not
to
take
on
a
picked
crew
he
was
perfectly
right
in
this
but
he
ought
never
to
have
sent
the
challenge
at
all
as
two
ships
but
an
hour
or
two
out
of
port
would
be
at
a
frightful
disadvantage
in
a
fight
if
our
frigates
were
ships
the
disguise
was
certainly
marvellously
complete
and
they
had
a
number
of
companions
equally
disguised
in
the
british
ranks
the
were
thus
with
one
complete
battery
of
long
guns
and
one
interrupted
one
of
carronades
that
they
were
better
than
any
other
frigates
was
highly
creditable
to
our
ingenuity
and
national
skill
we
can
not
perhaps
lay
claim
to
the
invention
and
first
use
of
the
heavy
frigate
for
frigates
were
already
in
the
service
of
at
least
three
nations
and
the
french
carronnade
in
use
on
their
threw
a
heavier
ball
than
our
but
we
had
enlarged
and
perfected
the
heavy
frigate
and
were
the
first
nation
that
ever
used
it
effectively
the
french
and
the
danish
shared
the
fate
of
ships
carrying
guns
of
lighter
calibre
and
the
british
like
the
had
never
accomplished
any
thing
hitherto
there
had
been
a
strong
feeling
especially
in
england
that
an
gun
was
as
effective
as
a
in
arming
a
frigate
we
made
a
complete
revolution
in
this
respect
england
had
been
building
only
vessels
when
she
ought
to
have
been
building
it
was
greatly
to
our
credit
that
our
average
frigate
was
superior
to
the
average
british
frigate
exactly
as
it
was
to
our
discredit
that
the
was
so
ineffectively
armed
captain
porter
owed
his
defeat
chiefly
to
his
ineffective
guns
but
also
to
having
lost
his
topmast
to
the
weather
being
unfavorable
and
still
more
to
the
admirable
skill
with
which
hilyar
used
his
superior
armament
the
and
owed
their
defeat
partly
to
their
lighter
guns
but
much
more
to
the
fact
that
their
captains
and
seamen
did
not
display
either
as
good
seamanship
or
as
good
gunnery
as
their
foes
inferiority
in
armament
was
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
account
in
all
the
four
cases
but
it
was
more
marked
in
that
of
the
than
in
the
other
three
it
would
have
been
fairer
for
porter
to
say
that
he
had
been
captured
by
a
ship
than
for
the
captain
of
the
to
make
that
assertion
in
this
last
case
the
forces
of
the
two
ships
compared
almost
exactly
as
their
rates
a
was
matched
against
a
it
was
not
surprising
that
she
should
win
but
it
surprising
that
she
should
win
with
ease
and
impunity
the
long
on
the
no
more
made
her
a
ship
than
the
carronades
mounted
on
an
english
and
forecastle
made
a
ship
when
opposed
to
a
frenchman
with
only
and
on
his
when
a
few
years
before
the
english
had
captured
the
french
their
broadsides
were
respectively
and
pounds
a
greater
disparity
than
in
any
of
our
successful
fights
yet
no
author
thought
of
claiming
that
the
was
any
thing
but
a
frigate
so
with
the
throwing
which
took
the
throwing
but
the
facts
were
that
frigates
had
captured
exactly
as
our
in
turn
captured
the
shortly
before
great
britain
declared
war
on
us
one
of
her
frigates
the
throwing
lbs
in
a
broadside
captured
the
french
frigate
whose
broadside
was
only
lbs
the
force
of
the
former
was
thus
almost
double
that
of
the
latter
yet
the
battle
was
long
and
desperate
the
english
losing
and
the
french
men
this
conflict
then
reflected
as
much
credit
on
the
skill
and
seamanship
of
the
defeated
as
of
the
victorious
side
the
difference
in
loss
could
fairly
be
ascribed
to
the
difference
in
weight
of
metal
but
where
as
in
the
famous
of
the
difference
in
force
is
only
a
fifth
instead
of
a
half
and
yet
the
slaughter
instead
of
being
as
five
is
to
two
is
as
six
to
one
then
the
victory
is
certainly
to
be
ascribed
as
much
to
superiority
in
skill
as
to
superiority
in
force
but
on
the
other
hand
it
should
always
be
remembered
that
there
was
a
very
decided
superiority
in
force
it
is
a
very
discreditable
feature
of
many
of
our
naval
histories
that
they
utterly
ignore
this
superiority
seeming
ashamed
to
confess
that
it
existed
in
reality
it
was
something
to
be
proud
of
it
was
highly
to
the
credit
of
the
united
states
that
her
frigates
were
of
better
make
and
armament
than
any
others
it
always
speaks
well
for
a
nation
energy
and
capacity
that
any
of
her
implements
of
warfare
are
of
superior
kind
this
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
reason
for
pride
it
spoke
well
for
the
prussians
in
that
they
opposed
to
the
of
the
austrians
but
it
would
be
folly
to
give
all
the
credit
of
the
victory
to
the
and
none
to
moltke
and
his
lieutenants
thus
it
must
remembered
that
two
things
contributed
to
our
victories
one
was
the
excellent
make
and
armament
of
our
ships
the
other
was
the
skilful
seamanship
excellent
discipline
and
superb
gunnery
of
the
men
who
were
in
them
british
writers
are
apt
only
to
speak
of
the
first
and
americans
only
of
the
last
whereas
both
should
be
taken
into
consideration
to
sum
up
the
american
frigate
was
a
true
frigate
in
build
and
armament
properly
rated
stronger
than
a
frigate
just
about
in
the
proportion
of
to
and
not
exceeding
in
strength
an
frigate
as
much
as
the
latter
exceeded
one
carrying
they
were
in
no
way
whatever
ships
but
they
were
superior
to
any
other
frigates
afloat
and
what
is
still
more
important
they
were
better
manned
and
commanded
than
the
frigate
of
any
other
navy
lord
codrington
says
memoirs
i
but
i
well
know
the
system
of
favoritism
and
borough
corruption
prevails
so
very
much
that
many
people
are
promoted
and
kept
in
command
that
should
be
dismissed
the
service
and
while
such
is
the
case
the
few
americans
chosen
for
their
merit
may
be
expected
to
follow
up
their
successes
except
where
they
meet
with
our
best
officers
on
even
terms

to
show
that
i
am
not
quoting
an
authority

our
favor

will
give
sir

our

it
is
curious
to
observe
the
animosity
which
prevails
here
among
what
is
called
the
better

people

i
think
is
more
a
misnomer
here
than
in
any
other
country
i
have
ever
been

democrat
and
federalist

it
would
seem
for
the
sake
of

vent

bitterness

the

every

the

the
opposite
political
creed
to

of
his
nearest

the
small
size
of
our
navy
was
probably
to
a
certain
extent
effective
in
keeping
it
up
to
a
high
standard
but
this

i
wish
i
could
have
got

than
james
for
the
british
side
of
the
question
he
is
so
bitter
that
it
involuntarily
gives
one
a
distrust
of
his
judgment
thus
in
speaking
of
the
capture
he
in
endeavoring
to
show
that
the
loss
was
greater
than
she
acknowledged
says
several
of
the
dangerously
wounded
were
thrown
overboard
because
the
surgeon
was
afraid
to
amputate
owing
to
his
want
of
experience

occurrences
now
what
could
persuade
a
writer
to
make
such
a
foolish
accusation
no
matter
how
utterly
depraved
and
brutal
captain
biddle
might
be
he
would
certainly
not
throw
his
wounded
over
alive
because
he
feared
they
might
die
again
in
vol
vi
he
says
captain
stewart
had
caused

the
object
of
this
was
to
aggrandize
his

how

captain
stewart

how
great
the

of
the
bostonians
the
which
by
the
way

no
more
be

it
very
difficult
to
separate
what

from
what

of
opinion
i
always
rely
on
the
british
official
accounts
when
they
can
be
reached
except
in
the
case
of
the
which
seem
garbled
that
such
was
sometimes
the
case
with
british
officials
is
testified
to
by
both
james

and
brenton
vol
ii
note
from
the
memoir
of

broke
we
learn
that
his

was
wrong

a
number
of
particulars
see
also
any
one
of
the
numerous
biographies
of
lord
dundonald
the
hero
of
the
little
fight
it
is
very
unfortunate
that
the
british
stopped
publishing
official
accounts
of
their
defeats
it
could
not
well
help
giving
rise
to
unpleasant
suspicions
it
may
be
as
well
to
mention
here
again
that
james
accusations
do
not
really
detract
from
the
interest
attaching
to
the
war
and
its
value
for
purposes
of
study
if
as
he
says
the
american
commanders
were
cowards
and
their
crews
renegades
it
is
well
worth
while
to
learn
the
lesson
that
good
training
will
make
such
men
able
to
beat
brave
officers
with
loyal
crews
and
why
did
the
british
have
such
bad
average
crews
as
he
makes
out
he
says
for
instance
that
the
java
was
unusually
bad
yet
brenton
says
vol
ii
it
was
like
the
generality
of
our
crews
it
is
worth
while
explaining
the
reason
that
such
a
crew
was
generally
better
than
a
french
and
worse
than
an
american
one
again
the
armaments
of
the
american
as
well
as
of
the
british
ships
were
composed
of
three
very
different
styles
of
guns
the
first
or
long
gun
was
enormously
long
and
in
comparison
to
its
bore
and
in
consequence
very
heavy
it
possessed
a
very
long
range
and
varied
in
calibre
from
two
to
pounds
the
ordinary
calibres
in
our
navy
were
and
the
second
style
was
the
carronade
a
short
light
gun
of
large
bore
compared
to
a
long
gun
of
the
same
weight
it
carried
a
much
heavier
ball
for
a
much
shorter
distance
the
chief
calibres
were
and
the
first
and
the
last
being
hardly
in
use
in
our
navy
the
third
style
was
the
columbiad
of
an
intermediate
grade
between
the
first
two
thus
it
is
seen
that
a
gun
of
one
style
by
no
means
corresponds
to
a
gun
of
another
style
of
the
same
calibre
as
a
rough
example
a
long
a
columbiad
and
a
carronade
would
be
about
equivalent
to
one
another
these
guns
were
mounted
on
two
different
types
of
vessel
the
first
was
that
is
it
had
a
single
straight
open
deck
on
which
all
the
guns
were
mounted
this
class
included
one
heavy
corvette
the
the
and
the
through
the
port
on
each
side
each
of
these
mounted
a
long
gun
the
rest
of
their
guns
were
carronades
except
in
the
case
of
the
which
had
all
long
guns
above
these
came
the
frigates
whose
was
covered
above
by
another
deck
on
the
fore
and
aft
parts
forecastle
and
of
this
upper
open
deck
were
also
mounted
guns
the
guns
were
all
long
except
on
the
which
had
carronades
on
the
were
mounted
carronades
and
on
the
forecastle
also
carronades
with
two
long
where
two
ships
of
similar
armament
fought
one
another
it
is
easy
to
get
the
comparative
force
by
simply
comparing
the
weight
in
broadsides
each
side
presenting
very
nearly
the
same
proportion
of
long
guns
to
carronades
for
such
a
broadside
we
take
half
the
guns
mounted
in
the
ordinary
way
and
all
guns
mounted
on
pivots
or
shifting
thus
perry
force
in
guns
was
to
barclay
yet
each
presented
in
broadside
again
each
of
the
british
mounted
guns
presenting
in
broadside
besides
these
some
ships
mounted
run
through
the
or
neither
of
which
could
be
used
in
broadsides
nevertheless
i
include
them
both
because
it
works
in
about
an
equal
number
of
cases
against
each
navy
and
because
they
were
sometimes
terribly
effective
james
excludes
the
in
reality
he
ought
to
have
included
both
it
and
its
fellow
as
they
worked
more
damage
than
all
the
broadside
guns
put
together
again
he
excludes
the
though
in
her
action
they
proved
invaluable
yet
he
includes
those
of
the
and
though
the
former
were
probably
not
fired
so
i
shall
take
the
half
of
the
fixed
plus
all
the
movable
guns
aboard
in
comparing
broadside
force
but
the
chief
difficulty
appears
when
guns
of
one
style
are
matched
against
those
of
another
if
a
ship
armed
with
long
meets
one
armed
with
carronades
which
is
superior
in
force
at
long
range
the
first
and
at
short
range
the
second
and
of
course
each
captain
is
pretty
sure
to
insist
that
circumstances
forced
him
to
fight
at
a
disadvantage
the
result
would
depend
largely
on
the
skill
or
luck
of
each
commander
in
choosing
position
one
thing
is
certain
long
guns
are
more
formidable
than
carronades
of
the
same
calibre
there
are
exemplifications
of
this
rule
on
both
sides
of
course
american
writers
as
a
rule
only
pay
attention
to
one
set
of
cases
and
british
to
the
others
the
and
threw
a
heavier
broadside
than
the
but
were
certainly
less
formidably
armed
and
the
threw
a
heavier
broadside
than
the
yet
was
also
less
formidable
on
lake
ontario
the
american
ship
threw
less
metal
at
a
broadside
than
either
of
her
two
chief
antagonists
but
neither
could
be
called
her
equal
while
on
lake
champlain
a
parallel
case
is
afforded
by
the
british
ship
supposing
that
two
ships
throw
the
same
broadside
weight
of
metal
one
from
long
guns
the
other
from
carronades
at
short
range
they
are
equal
at
long
one
has
it
all
her
own
way
her
captain
thus
certainly
has
a
great
superiority
of
force
and
if
he
does
not
take
advantage
of
it
it
is
owing
to
his
adversary
skill
or
his
own
mismanagement
as
a
mere
approximation
it
may
be
assumed
in
comparing
the
broadsides
of
two
vessels
or
squadrons
that
long
guns
count
for
at
least
twice
as
much
as
carronades
of
the
same
calibre
thus
on
lake
champlain
captain
downie
possessed
an
immense
advantage
in
his
long
guns
which
commodore
macdonough
exceedingly
good
arrangements
nullified
sometimes
part
of
the
advantage
may
be
willingly
foregone
so
as
to
acquire
some
other
had
the
kept
at
long
bowls
with
the
and
she
could
have
probably
captured
one
without
any
loss
to
herself
while
the
other
would
have
escaped
she
preferred
to
run
down
close
so
as
to
insure
the
capture
of
both
knowing
that
even
at
close
quarters
long
guns
are
somewhat
better
than
short
ones
not
to
mention
her
other
advantages
in
thick
scantling
speed
the
british
carronades
often
upset
in
action
this
was
either
owing
to
their
having
been
insufficiently
secured
and
to
this
remaining
undiscovered
because
the
men
were
not
exercised
at
the
guns
or
else
it
was
because
the
unpractised
sailors
would
greatly
overcharge
them
our
sailors
on
the
ocean
rarely
committed
these
blunders
but
the
crews
on
the
lakes
did
so
as
often
as
their
antagonists
but
while
the
americans
thus
as
a
rule
had
heavier
and
guns
they
labored
under
one
or
two
disadvantages
our
foundries
were
generally
not
as
good
as
those
of
the
british
and
our
guns
in
consequence
more
likely
to
burst
it
was
an
accident
of
this
nature
which
saved
the
british
and
the
under
commodore
chauncy
and
the
new
american
frigate
suffered
in
the
same
way
while
often
the
muzzles
of
the
guns
would
crack
a
more
universal
disadvantage
was
in
the
short
weight
of
our
shot
when
captain
blakely
sunk
the
he
officially
reported
that
her
four
shot
which
came
aboard
weighed
just
pounds
apiece
a
pound
and
three
quarters
more
than
his
this
would
make
his
average
shot
about
pounds
less
or
rather
over
per
cent
exactly
similar
statements
were
made
by
the
officers
of
the
in
her
three
engagements
thus
when
she
fought
the
she
threw
at
a
broadside
as
already
stated
pounds
the
mounted
long
carronades
long
and
one
shifting
carronade
a
broadside
of
pounds
yet
by
the
actual
weighing
of
all
the
different
shot
on
both
sides
it
was
found
that
the
difference
in
broadside
force
was
only
about
pounds
or
the
shot
were
about
per
cent
short
weight
the
long
of
the
each
threw
a
shot
but
pounds
heavier
than
the
long
of
the
here
again
the
difference
was
about
per
cent
the
same
difference
existed
in
favor
of
the
and
compared
with
the
and
fenimore
cooper
footnote
see
naval
history
i
p
weighed
a
great
number
of
shot
some
time
after
the
war
the
later
castings
even
weighed
nearly
per
cent
less
than
the
british
shot
and
some
of
the
older
ones
about
per
cent
the
average
is
safe
to
take
at
per
cent
less
and
i
shall
throughout
make
this
allowance
for
ocean
cruisers
the
deficit
was
sometimes
owing
to
windage
but
more
often
the
shot
was
of
full
size
but
defective
in
density
the
effect
of
this
can
be
gathered
from
the
following
quotation
from
the
work
of
a
british
artillerist
the
greater
the
density
of
shot
of
like
calibres
projected
with
equal
velocity
and
elevation
the
greater
the
range
accuracy
and
penetration

captain
simmons

james
supposes
that
the
yankee
captains
have
in
each
case
hunted
round
till
they
could
get
particularly
small
american
shot
to
weigh
and
also
denies
that
short
weight
is
a
disadvantage
the
last
proposition
carried
out
logically
would
lead
to
some
rather
astonishing
results
this
defectiveness
in
density
might
be
a
serious
injury
in
a
contest
at
a
long
distance
but
would
make
but
little
difference
at
close
quarters
although
it
may
have
been
partly
owing
to
their
short
weight
that
so
many
of
the
chesapeake
shot
failed
to
penetrate
the
hull
thus
in
the
actions
with
the
and
the
american
frigates
showed
excellent
practice
when
the
contest
was
carried
on
within
fair
distance
while
their
first
broadsides
at
long
range
went
very
wild
but
in
the
case
of
the

not

degree
affected

had
amply
enough
to

the
courage
of

is
taken
for

it
was
not
so
much
a
factor
in
gaining
the
victory
as
one
which
if
lacking
was
fatal
to
all
chances
of
success
in
the
engagements
between
regular
cruisers
not
a
single
one
was
gained
by
superiority
in
courage
the
crews
of
both
the
and
certainly
flinched
but
had
they
fought
never
so
bravely
they
were
too
unskilful
to
win
the
crew
could
hardly
be
said
to
lack
courage
it
was
more
that
they
were
inferior
to
their
opponents
in
discipline
as
well
as
in
skill
there
was
but
one
conflict
during
the
war
where
the
victory
could
be
said
to
be
owing
to
superiority
in
pluck

hull
expected
to

overtaken

made
every
arrangement
to
try
in
such
case
to
disable
the
first
frigate
before
her
consorts
could
close
but
neither
the
nor
the
dared
to
tow
very
near
for
fear
of
having
their
boats
sunk
by
the
american
the
crew
showed
the
most
excellent
spirit
officers

relieved
each
other

former

their
rest

the
drew
ahead
but
the
situation
continued
most
critical
all
through
the
afternoon
the
british
frigates
kept
towing
and
kedging
being
barely
out
of
gunshot
at
a
light
breeze
sprung
up
and
blew
fitfully
at
intervals
every
puff
was
watched
closely
and
taken
advantage
of
to
the
utmost
at
in
the
evening
the
wind
almost
died
out
and
for
four
more
weary
hours
the
sailors
towed
and
kedged
at
a
little
breeze
struck
the
frigate
when
the
boats
dropped
alongside
and
were
hoisted
up
excepting
the
first
cutter
throughout
the
night
the
wind
continued
very
light
the
forging
ahead
till
she
was
off
the
lee
beam
and
at
on
the
morning
of
the
she
tacked
to
the
eastward
the
breeze
being
light
from
the
south
by
east
at
the
tacked
also
and
at
the
which
had
drawn
ahead
passed
on
the
contrary
tack
soon
afterward
the
wind
freshened
so
that
captain
hull
took
in
his
cutter
the
was
now
so
far
to
leeward
as
to
be
almost
out
of
the
race
while
the
five
frigates
were
all
running
on
the
starboard
tack
with
every
stitch
of
canvas

at

the

five
miles
off
on

quarter

afterward
the
breeze
freshened
and
old
ironsides
drew
slowly
ahead
from
her
foes
her
sails
being
watched
and
tended
with
the
most
consummate
skill
at
the
breeze
again
lightened
but
even
the
was
now
four
miles
astern
and
to
leeward
at
there
were
indications
of
a
heavy
rain
squall
which
once
more
permitted
hull
to
show
that
in
seamanship
he
excelled
even
the
able
captains
against
whom
he
was
pitted
the
crew
were
stationed
and
every
thing
kept
fast
till
the
last
minute
when
all
was
clewed
up
just
before
the
squall
struck
the
ship
the
light
canvas
was
furled
a
second
reef
taken
in
the
mizzen
and
the
ship
almost
instantly
brought
under
short
sail
the
british
vessels
seeing
this
began
to
let
go
and
haul
down
without
waiting
for
the
wind
and
were
steering
on
different
tacks
when
the
first
gust
struck
them
but
hull
as
soon
as
he
got
the
weight
of
the
wind
sheeted
home
hoisted
his
fore
and
gallant
sails
and
went
off
on
an
easy
bowline

the
rate
of
knots

the
enemy

squall
having
passed
to
leeward
the
the
nearest
vessel
had
altered
her
bearings
two
points
to
leeward
and
was
a
long
way
astern
next
came
the
the

down

in
a
very

manner

her
sails

the
to

on
the
morning

the
the
pursuers
were
almost
out

at
they
abandoned
the
chase

once

to
investigate
the
character
of
two
strange
vessels
but
found
them
to
be
only
americans

at
midday
he
stood
toward
the
east

this

captain

was
matched
against
five
british
captains
two
of
whom
broke

byron
were
fully
equal
to
any
in
their
navy
and
while
the
latter
showed
great
perseverance
good
seamanship
and
ready
imitation
there
can
be
no

that
the
palm
in
every
way

to
the
cool

yankee
every
daring
expedient

the

perfect
seamanship

tried
with
success

no
victorious
fight
could
reflect
more
credit
on
the
conqueror
than
this
three
days

superior

his
official
letter
have
treated
us
like
brave
and
generous
enemies
the
greatest
care
has
been
taken
that
we
should
not
lose
the
smallest
trifle
the
british
laid
very
great
stress
on
the
rotten
and
decayed
condition
of
the
mentioning
in
particular
that
the
mainmast
fell
solely
because
of
the
weight
of
the
falling
foremast
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
until
the
action
occurred
she
was
considered
a
very
fine
ship
thus
in
brighton
memoir
of
admiral
broke
it
is
declared
that
dacres
freely
expressed
the
opinion
that
she
could
take
a
ship
in
half
the
time
the
could
the
fall
of
the
occurred
when
the
fight
was
practically
over
it
had
no
influence
whatever
on
the
conflict
it
was
also
asserted
that
her
powder
was
bad
but
on
no
authority
her
first
broadside
fell
short
but
so
under
similar
circumstances
did
the
first
broadside
of
the
none
of
these
causes
account
for
the
fact
that
her
shot
did
not
hit
her
opponent
was
of
such
superior
force
nearly
in
the
proportion
of
to
that
success
would
have
been
very
difficult
in
any
event
and
no
one
can
doubt
the
gallantry
and
pluck
with
which
the
british
ship
was
fought
but
the
execution
was
very
greatly
disproportioned
to
the
force
the
gunnery
of
the
was
very
poor
and
that
of
the
excellent
during
the
few
minutes
the
ships
were
and
the
latter
was
not
hulled
once
while
no
less
than
shot
took
effect
on
the
former
engaged
side

the

to

not
enough
to
account
for
the
disparity
of
execution
to
of

something
must
be
allowed
for
the
decayed
state
of
the

although
i
really
do
not
think
it
had
any

on

for

when

mast
fell

it
must
be

on

that
the

that
while

admiring

gallantry

of
captain
dacres

and
acknowledging
that
he
fought
at

disadvantage
especially
in

all
must
acknowledge
that
the
combat
showed
a
marked
superiority
particularly
in
gunnery
on
the
part
of
the
americans
had
the
ships
not
come

captain

would
probably
not
have
lost
more
than
three
or
four
men
as
it
was
he
suffered
but
slightly
that
the
was
not
so
weak
as
she
was
represented
to
be
can
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
she
mounted
two
more
guns
than
the
rest
of
her
class
thus
carrying
on
her
long

battery
to
oppose
to
the
long

rather
allowing
for
the
short
weight
of

of
the
characteristically
enough
james
though
he
carefully
reckons
in
the
long

the

and
yet
refuses
to
count
the
two
long
eighteens
mounted
through
the
on
the
now

turned
out
these
two
bow

interchangeable
terms
captain
dacres
very
much
to
his
credit
allowed
the
ten
americans
on
board
to
go
below
so
as
not
to
fight
against
their
flag
and
in
his
address
to
the
mentions
among
the
reasons
for
his
defeat
that
he
was
very
much
weakened
by
permitting
the
americans
on
board
to
quit
their
quarters
coupling
this
with
the
assertion
made
by
james
and
most
other
british
writers
that
the
was
largely
manned
by
englishmen
we
reach
the
somewhat
remarkable
conclusion
that
the
british
ship
was
defeated
because
the
americans
on
board
would
fight
against
their
country
and
that
the
american
was
victorious
because
the
british
on
board
however
as
i
have
shown
in
reality
there
were
probably
not
a
score
of
british
on
board
the
in
this
as
well
as
the
two
succeeding
frigate
actions
every
one
must
admit
that
there
was
a
great
superiority
in
force
on
the
side
of
the
victors
and
british
historians
have
insisted
that
this
superiority
was
so
great
as
to
preclude
any
hopes
of
a
successful
resistance
that
this
was
not
true
and
that
the
disparity
between
the
combatants
was
not
as
great
as
had
been
the
case
in
a
number
of
encounters
in
which
english
frigates
had
taken
french
ones
can
be
best
shown
by
a
few
accounts
taken
from
the
french
historian
troude
who
would
certainly
not
exaggerate
the
difference
thus
on
march
the
english
frigate
captured
the
french
frigate
after
an
action
of
two
hours
and
ten
minutes

it

possible
that

had
landed
some

james
asserts
and
though
i
am
not
at
all
sure
of
this
i
have
thought
it
best
to
be
on
the
safe
side
in
describing
his
force
the
damage
done
was
as
nine
to
one
of
course
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
for
the
to
conquer
with
one
third
less
force
but
the
disparity
was
by
no
means
sufficient
to
account
for
the
ninefold
greater
loss
suffered
and
the
ease
and
impunity
with
which
the
victory
was
won
the
british
sailors
fought
with
their
accustomed
courage
but
their
gunnery
was
exceedingly
poor
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
though
the
ship
was
bravely
fought
still
the
defence
was
by
no
means
so
desperate
as
that
made
by
the
or
even
the
as
witnessed
by
their
respective
losses
the
moreover
was
surrendered
when
she
had
suffered
less
damage
than
either
the
or
the
chief
cause
of
her
loss
lay
in
the
fact
that
captain
carden
was
a
poor
commander
the
gunnery
of
the
and
was
equally
bad
but
while
captain
lambert
proved
himself
to
be
as
able
as
he
was
gallant
and
captain
dacres
did
nearly
as
well
captain
carden
on
the
other
hand
was
first
too
timid
and
then
too
rash
and
showed
bad
judgment
at
all
times
by
continuing
his
original
course
he
could
have
closed
at
once
but
he
lost
his
chance
by
to
keep
the
and
was
censured
by
the
accordingly
then
he
tried
to
remedy
one
error
by
another
and
made
a
foolishly
rash
approach
a
very
able
and
english
writer
says
of
this
action
as
a
display
of
courage
the
character
of
the
service
was
nobly
upheld
but
we
would
be
deceiving
ourselves
were
we
to
admit
that
the
comparative
expertness
of
the
crews
in
gunnery
was
equally
satisfactory
now
taking
the
difference
of
effect
as
given
by
captain
carden
we
must
draw
this
conclusion
that
the
comparative
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
to
together
with
the
dreadful
account
he
gives
of
the
condition
of
his
own
ship
while
he
admits
that
the
enemy
vessel
was
in
comparatively
good
order
must
have
arisen
from
inferiority
in
gunnery
as
well
as
in
force
footnote
lord
howard
douglass
naval
gunnery
on
the
other
hand
the
american
crew
even
according
to
james
were
as
fine
a
set
of
men
as
ever
were
seen
on
shipboard
though
not
one
fourth
were
british
by
birth
yet
many
of
them
had
served
on
board
british
ships
of
war
in
some
cases
voluntarily
but
much
more
often
because
they
were
impressed
they
had
been
trained
at
the
guns
with
the
greatest
care
by
lieutenant
allen
and
finally
commodore
decatur
handled
his
ship
with
absolute
faultlessness
to
sum
up
a
brave
and
skilful
crew
ably
commanded
was
matched
against
an
equally
brave
but
unskilful
one
with
an
incompetent
leader
and
this
accounts
for
the
disparity
of
loss
being
so
much
greater
than
the
disparity
in
force
at
the
outset
of
this
battle
the
position
of
the
parties
was
just
the
reverse
of
that
in
the
case
of
the
and
the
englishman
had
the
advantage
of
the
wind
but
he
used
it
in
a
very
different
manner
from
that
in
which
captain
hull
had
done
the
latter
at
once
ran
down
to
close
but
manoeuvred
so
cautiously
that
no
damage
could
be
done
him
till
he
was
within
pistol
shot
captain
carden
did
not
try
to
close
till
after
fatal
indecision
and
then
made
the
attempt
so
heedlessly
that
he
was
cut
to
pieces
before
he
got
to
close
quarters
commodore
decatur
also
manoeuvred
more
skilfully
than
captain
dacres
although
the
difference
was
less
marked
between
these
two
the
combat
was
a
plain
cannonade
the
derived
no
advantage
from
the
superior
number
of
her
men
for
they
were
not
needed
the
marines
in
particular
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
while
they
had
been
of
the
greatest
service
against
the
the
advantage
was
simply
in
metal
as
is
to
lord
howard
douglass
criticisms
on
these
actions
seem
to
me
only
applicable
in
part
he
says
the
americans
would
neither
approach
nor
permit
us
to
join
in
close
battle
until
they
had
gained
some
extraordinary
advantage
from
the
superior
faculties
of
their
long
guns
in
distant
cannonade
and
from
the
intrepid
uncircumspect
and
often
very
exposed
approach
of
assailants
who
had
long
been
accustomed
to
contemn
all
manoeuvring
our
vessels
were
crippled
in
distant
cannonade
from
encountering
rashly
the
serious
disadvantage
of
making
direct
attacks
the
uncircumspect
gallantry
of
our
commanders
led
our
ships
unguardedly
into
the
snares
which
wary
caution
had
spread
these
criticisms
are
very
just
as
regards
the
and
i
fully
agree
with
them
possibly
reserving
the
right
to
doubt
captain
carden
gallantry
though
readily
admitting
his
uncircumspection
but
the
case
of
the
differed
widely
there
the
american
ship
made
the
attack
while
the
british
at
first
avoided
close
combat
and
so
far
from
trying
to
cripple
her
adversary
by
a
distant
cannonade
the
hardly
fired
a
dozen
times
until
within
pistol
shot
this
last
point
is
worth
mentioning
because
in
a
work
on
heavy
ordnance
by
captain
simmons
a
london
it
is
stated
that
the
received
her
injuries
the
closing
mentioning
especially
the
thirty
shot
below
the
whereas
by
the
official
accounts
of
both
commanders
the
reverse
was
the
case
captain
hull
in
his
letter
and
lieutenant
morris
in
his
autobiography
say
they
only
fired
a
few
guns
before
closing
and
captain
dacres
in
his
letter
and
captain
brenton
in
his
history
say
that
not
much
injury
was
received
by
the
until
about
the
time
the
fell

was
three
or
four
minutes
after

turned

only
sent
the

he
would

no

he
states

because

that
any
such

kept

from

no

captain

was
perfectly
justifiable

it
is
curious
that
with

the

irishman
and
lately
an
assistant
surgeon
in
the
british
navy
naval
chronicle
xxix
which
draws
from
surgeon
amos
evans
a
solemn
statement
in
the
boston
that
he
was
born
in
maryland
and
was
never
in
the
british
navy

his
life
then
surgeon
jones
of
the
in
his
official
report
after
giving
his
own
killed
and
mortally
wounded
at
says
that
the
americans
lost
in
all
about
and
that
of
their
amputations
perished
under
his
own
eyes
whereupon
surgeon
evans
makes
the
statement
vi
backed
up
by
affidavits
of
his
brother
officers
that
in
all
he
had
but
five
amputations
of
whom
only
one
died
and
that
one
a
month
after
surgeon
jones
had
left
the
ship
to
meet
the
assertions
of
lieutenant
chads
that
he
began
action
with
but
men
the
officers
produced
the
dated
or
five
days
after
she
had
sailed
which
showed
persons
of
whom
had
been
put
on
board
a
prize
the
presence
of
this
large
number
of
supernumeraries
on
board
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
was
carrying
out
hislop
the
governor
of
bombay
and
his
suite
together
with
part
of
the
crews
for
the
and
and
she
also
contained
stores
for
those
two
ships
besides
conflicting
with
the
american
reports
the
british
statements
contradict
one
another
the
official
published
report
gives
but
two
midshipmen
as
killed
while
one
of
the
volumes
of
the
naval
chronicle
vol
xxix
contains
a
letter
from
one
of
the
lieutenants
in
which
he
states
that
there
were
five

commodore
bainbridge
found
on

after
the
prisoners
had
left
a

from
lieutenant
cornick

addressed
to
lieutenant
peter
wood

which
he
states
that
of
their
men
were
killed
james
naval
occurrences
gets
around
this
by
stating
that
it
was
probably
a
forgery
but
aside
from
the
improbability
of
commodore
bainbridge
being
a
forger
this
could
not
be
so
for
nothing
would
have
been
easier
than
for
the
british
lieutenant
to
have
denied
having
written
it
which
he
never
did
on
the
other
hand
it
would
be
very
likely
that
in
the
heat
of
the
action
commodore
bainbridge
and
the
own
officers
should
overestimate
the

as
his
opinions
are
certainly
well
worthy
of

both
as
to

as
to
the
lessons
they
teach

to

if
they

it
would
still
be
difficult
to
explain
the
prodigious
success
of
the
americans
in
an
engagement
which
terminated
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
english
frigate
completely
dismasted
had
fifteen
men
killed
wounded
and
more
than
thirty
shot
below

she
sank
twelve
hours
after
the
combat
the
on
the
contrary
had
but
seven
men
killed
and
seven
wounded
and
did
not
lose
a
mast
as
soon
as
she
had
replaced
a
few
cut
ropes
and
changed
a
few
sails
she
was
in
condition
even
by
the
testimony
of
the
british
historian
to
take
another
the
took
an
hour
and
a
half
to
capture
the
and
the
same
difference
made
itself
felt
in
the
damage
suffered
by
the
two
ships
the
had
her
masts
shattered
two
of
her
and
all
her
guns
disabled
more
than
a
hundred
shot
had
penetrated
the
hull
and
over
a
third
of
the
crew
had
suffered
by
the
hostile
fire
the
american
frigate
on
the
contrary
had
to
regret
but
five
men
killed
and
seven
wounded
her
guns
had
been
fired
each
times
to
the
the
combat
of
the
and
the
lasted
two
hours
and
was
the
most
bloody
of
these
three
engagements
the
only
struck
when
she
had
been
razed
like
a
sheer
hulk
she
had
men
killed
and
one
hundred
and
two
wounded
this
war
should
be
studied
with
unceasing
diligence
the
pride
of
two
peoples
to
whom
naval
affairs
are
so
generally
familiar
has
cleared
all
the
details
and
laid
bare
all
the
episodes
and
through
the
sneers
which
the
victors
should
have
spared
merely
out
of
care
for
their
own
glory
at
every
step
can
be
seen
that
great
truth
that
there
is
only
success
for
those
who
know
how
to
prepare
it
it
belongs
to
us
to
judge
impartially
these
marine
events
too
much
exalted
perhaps
by
a
national
vanity
one
is
tempted
to
excuse
the
americans
showed
in
the
war
of
a
great
deal
of
skill
and
resolution
but
if
as
they
have
asserted
the
chances
had
always
been
perfectly
equal
between
them
and
their
adversaries
if
they
had
only
owed
their
triumphs
to
the
intrepidity
of
hull
decatur
and
bainbridge
there
would
be
for
us
but
little
interest
in
recalling
the
struggle
we
need
not
seek
lessons
in
courage
outside
of
our
own
history
on
the
contrary
what
is
to
be
well
considered
is
that
the
ships
of
the
united
states
constantly
fought
with
chances
in
their
favor
and
it
is
on
this
that
the
american
government
should
found
its
true
title
to
glory
the
americans
in
had
secured
to
themselves
the
advantage
of
a
better
organization
than
the
english
the
fight
between
the
and
the
illustrates
best
the
proposition
that
there
is
only
success
for
those
who
know
how
to
prepare
it
here
the
odds
in
men
and
metal
were
only
about
as
to
in
favor
of
the
victors
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
they
might
have
been
reversed
without
vitally
affecting
the
result
in
the
fight
lambert
handled
his
ship
as
skilfully
as
bainbridge
did
his
and
the
men
proved
by
their
indomitable
courage
that
they
were
excellent
material
the
crew
was
new
shipped
for
the
voyage
and
had
been
at
sea
but
six
weeks
in
the
first
fight
her
crew
had
been
aboard
of
her
but
weeks
so
the
chances
should
have
been
nearly
equal
and
the
difference
in
fighting
capacity
that
was
shown
by
the
enormous
disparity
in
the
loss
and
still
more
in
the
damage
inflicted
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
officers
of
one
ship
had
and
the
officers
of
the
other
had
not
trained
their
raw
crews
the
men
were
not
picked
but
simply
average
american
sailors
as
the
were
average
british
sailors
the
essential
difference
was
in
the
training
during
the
six
weeks
the
was
at
sea
her
men
had
fired
but
six
broadsides
of
blank
cartridges
during
the
first
five
weeks
the
cruised
her
crew
were
incessantly
practised
at
firing
with
blank
cartridges
and
also
at
a
target

looking
through
the
logs
of

we
continually

afterward
firing
at

the
java
crew
had
only
been
exercised
occasionally
even
in
pointing
the
guns
and
when
the
captain
of
a
gun
was
killed
the
effectiveness
of
the
piece
was
temporarily
ruined
and
moreover
the
men
did
not
work
together
the
crew
were
exercised
till
they
worked
like
machines
and
yet
with
enough
individuality
to
render
it
impossible
to
cripple
a
gun
by
killing
one
man
the
unpractised
british
sailors
fired
at
random
the
trained
americans
took
aim
the
british
marines
had
not
been
taught
any
thing
approximating
to
skirmishing
or
the
americans
had
the
british
sailors
had
not
even
been
trained
enough
in
the
ordinary
duties
of
seamen
while
the
americans
in
five
weeks
had
been
rendered
almost
perfect
the
former
were
at
a
loss
what
to
do
in
an
emergency
at
all
out
of
their
own
line
of
work
they
were
helpless
when
the
wreck
fell
over
their
guns
when
the
americans
would
have
cut
it
away
in
a
jiffy
as
we
learn
from
commodore
morris
autobiography
each
yankee
sailor
could
at
need
do
a
little
carpentering
or
and
so
was
more
the
crew
had
been
trained
to
act
as
if
guided
by
one
mind
yet
each
man
retained
his
own
individuality
the
petty
officers
were
better
paid
than
in
great
britain
and
so
were
of
a
better
class
of
men
thoroughly
the
americans
soon
got
their
subordinates
in
order
while
the
british
did
not
to
sum
up
one
ship
crew
had
been
trained
practically
and
thoroughly
while
the
other
crew
was
not
much
better
off
than
the
day
it
sailed
and
as
far
as
it
goes
this
is
a
good
test
of
the
efficiency
of
the
two
navies
the
brig
lieutenant
george
u
read
had
been
cruising
off
the
southern
coast
on
she
fell
in
with
the
captain
sir
james
lucas
yeo
and
was
captured
after
a
short
but
severe
trial
of
speed
both
vessels
were
wrecked
soon
afterward
the
captain
david
porter
left
the
delaware
on
two
days
after
commodore
bainbridge
had
left
boston
she
expected
to
make
a
very
long
cruise
and
so
carried
with
her
an
unusual
quantity
of
stores
and
sixty
more
men
than
ordinarily
so
that
her
contained
names
being
deep
in
the
water
she
reached
san
jago
after
bainbridge
had
left
nothing
was
met
with
until
after
the
essex
had
crossed
the
equator
in
longitude
on
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
a
sail
was
made
out
to
windward
and
chased
at
nine
in
the
evening
it
was
overtaken
and
struck
after
receiving
a
volley
of
musketry
which
killed
one
man
the
prize
proved
to
be
the
british
packet
of
guns
and
men
with
in
specie
aboard
the
latter
was
taken
out
and
the
sent
home
with
lieutenant
finch
and
a
prize
crew
of
men
but
was
recaptured
by
a
british
frigate
the
next
appointed
rendezvous
was
the
island
of
fernando
de
noronha
where
captain
porter
found
a
letter
from
commodore
bainbridge
informing
him
that
the
other
vessels
were
off
cape
frio
thither
cruised
porter
but
his
compatriots
had
left
on
the
he
captured
an
english
merchant
vessel
and
he
was
still
cruising
when
the
year
closed
the
year
on
the
ocean
ended
as
gloriously
as
it
had
begun
in
four
victorious
fights
the
disparity
in
loss
had
been
so
great
as
to
sink
the
disparity
of
force
into
insignificance
our
successes
had
been
unaccompanied
by
any
important
reverse
nor
was
it
alone
by
the
victories
but
by
the
cruises
that
the
year
was
noteworthy
the
yankee
sailed
almost
in
sight
of
the
british
coast
and
right
in
the
tract
of
the
merchant
fleets
and
their
armed
protectors
our
vessels
had
shown
themselves
immensely
superior
to
their
foes
the
reason
of
these
striking
and
unexpected
successes
was
that
our
navy
in
was
the
exact
reverse
of
what
our
navy
is
now
in
i
am
not
alluding
to
the
personnel
which
still
remains
excellent
but
whereas
we
now
have
a
large
number
of
worthless
vessels
standing
very
low
down
in
their
respective
classes
we
then
possessed
a
few
vessels
each
unsurpassed
by
any
foreign
ship
of
her
class
to
bring
up
our
navy
to
the
condition
in
which
it
stood
in
it
would
not
be
although
in
reality
both
very
wise
and
in
the
end
very
economical
to
spend
any
more
money
than
at
present
only
instead
of
using
it
to
patch
up
a
hundred
antiquated
hulks
it
should
be
employed
in
building
half
a
dozen
ships
on
the
most
effective
model
if
in
our
ships
had
borne
the
same
relation
to
the
british
ships
that
they
do
now
not
all
the
courage
and
skill
of
our
sailors
would
have
won
us
a
single
success
as
it
was
we
could
only
cope
with
the
lower
rates
and
had
no
vessels
to
oppose
to
the
great
liners
but
there
is
hardly
any
foreign
ship
no
matter
how
low
its
rate
that
is
not
superior
to
the
corresponding
american
ones
it
is
too
much
to
hope
that
our
political
shortsightedness
will
ever
enable
us
to
have
a
navy
that
is
in
point
of
size
but
there
certainly
seems
no
reason
why
what
ships
we
have
should
not
be
of
the
very
best
quality
the
effect
of
a
victory
is
moral
and
material
had
we
been
as
roughly
handled
on
water
as
we
were
on
land
during
the
first
year
of
the
war
such
a
succession
of
disasters
would
have
had
a
most
demoralizing
effect
on
the
nation
at
large
as
it
was
our
victorious
seafights
while
they
did
not
inflict
any
material
damage
upon
the
colossal
of
england
had
the
most
important
results
in
the
feelings
they
produced
at
home
and
even
abroad
of
course
they
were
magnified
absurdly
by
most
of
our
writers
at
the
time
but
they
do
not
need
to
be
magnified
for
as
they
are
any
american
can
look
back
upon
them
with
the
keenest
national
pride
for
a
hundred
and
thirty
years
england

was
so
sparsely
settled
and
covered
with
such
a
dense
growth
of
forest
that
it
was
practically
impossible
for
either
of
the
contending
parties
to
advance
an
army
through
its
territory
a
continuation
of
the

wooded
and
mountainous
district
protected
the
northern
parts
of
vermont
and
new
hampshire
while
in
new

the
adirondack
region
was
an
impenetrable
wilderness
it
thus
came
about
that
the
northern
boundary
was
formed
for
military
purposes
by
lake

lake

the
niagara
lake

the

and
after
an
interval
by

the
road

states
by
the
latter
ran
close
along
shore
and
without
a
naval

the

would
be
wholly
unable
to
protect
his
flanks
and
would
probably
have
his
communications
cut
this

however
was
almost
wholly
within
the
united
states
and
did
not
become
of
importance
till
toward
the
end
of
the
war
upon
it
were
two
american
regularly
officered
and
manned
and
for
such
smooth
water
sufficiently
effective
vessels
what
was
at
that
time
the
western
part
of
the
northern
frontier
became
the
main
theatre
of
military
operations
and
as
it
presented
largely
a
water
front
a
naval
force
was
an
indispensable
adjunct
the
command
of
the
lakes
being
of
the
utmost
importance
as
these
lakes
were
fitted
for
the
manoeuvring
of
ships
of
the
largest
size
the
operations
upon
them
were
of
the
same
nature
as
those
on
the
ocean
and
properly
belong
to
naval
and
not
to
military
history
but
while
on
the
ocean
america
started
with
too
few
ships
to
enable
her
really
to
do
any
serious
harm
to
her
antagonist
on
the
inland
waters
the
two
sides
began
very
nearly
on
an
equality
the
chief
regular
forces
either
belligerent
possessed
were
on
lake
ontario
here
the
united
states
had
a
brig
the
of
tons
carrying
carronades
manned
by
experienced
seamen
and
commanded
by
lieutenant
woolsey
great
britain
possessed
the
of
and
all
under
the
command
of
a
commodore
earle
but
though
this
force
was
so
much
the
more
powerful
it
was
very
inefficient
not
being
considered
as
belonging
to
the
regular
navy
the
sailors
being
undisciplined
and
the
officers
totally
without
experience
never
having
been
really
trained
in
the
british
service
from
these
causes
it
resulted
that
the
struggle
on
the
lakes
was
to
be
a
work
as
much
of
creating
as
of
using
a
navy
on
the
seaboard
success
came
to
those
who
made
best
use
of
the
ships
that
had
already
been
built
on
the
lakes
the
real
contest
lay
in
the
building
and
building
an
inland
navy
was
no
easy
task
the
country
around
the
lakes
especially
on
the
south
side
was
still
very
sparsely
settled
and
all
the
american
naval
supplies
had
to
be
brought
from
the
seaboard
cities
through
the
valley
of
the
mohawk
there
was
no
canal
or
other
means
of
communication
except
very
poor
roads
intermittently
relieved
by
transportation
on
the
mohawk
and
on
oneida
lake
when
they
were
navigable
supplies
were
thus
brought
up
at
an
enormous
cost
with
tedious
delays
and
great
difficulty
and
bad
weather
put
a
stop
to
all
travel
very
little
indeed
beyond
timber
could
be
procured
at
the
stations
on
the
lakes
still
a
few
scattered
villages
and
small
towns
had
grown
up
on
the
shores
whose
inhabitants
were
largely
engaged
in
the
carrying
trade
the
vessels
used
for
the
purpose
were
generally
small
sloops
or
schooners
swift
and
fairly
good
sailors
but
very
shallow
and
not
fitted
for
rough
weather
the
frontiersmen
themselves
whether
canadian
or
american
were
bold
hardy
seamen
and
when
properly
trained
and
led
made
excellent
men
but
on
the
american
side
they
were
too
few
in
number
and
too
untrained
to
be
made
use
of
and
the
seamen
had
to
come
from
the
coast
but
the
canadian
shores
had
been
settled
longer
the
inhabitants
were
more
numerous
and
by
means
of
the
lawrence
the
country
was
easy
of
access
to
great
britain
so
that
the
seat
of
war
as
regards
getting
naval
supplies
and
even
men
was
nearer
to
great
britain
than
to
us
our
enemies
also
possessed
in
addition
to
the
squadron
on
lake
ontario
another
on
lake
erie
consisting
of
the
and
these
two
squadrons
furnished
training
schools
for
some
five
hundred
canadian
seamen
whom
a
short
course
of
discipline
under
experienced
officers
sufficed
to
render
as
good
men
as
their
british
friends
or
american
foes
very
few
british
seamen
ever
reached
lake
erie
according
to
james
not
over
fifty
but
on
lake
ontario
and
afterward
on
lake
champlain
they
formed
the
bulk
of
the
crews
picked
seamen
sent
out
by
government
expressly
for
service
on
the
canada
lakes

james

as
the
contrary
has
sometimes
been

it
may
be
as
well
to
mention
that

states
that
no
want
of
seamen
contributed
to
the
british
disasters
on
the
lakes

at

drafted
from

service

were

footnote
memoirs
i
referring
especially
to
battle
of
lake
champlain
i
am
bound
to
state
that
while
i
think
that
on
the
ocean
our
sailors
showed
themselves
superior
to
their
opponents
especially
in
gun
practice
on
the
lakes
the
men
of
the
rival
fleets
were
as
evenly
matched
in
skill
and
courage
as
could
well
be
the
difference
when
there
was
any
appeared
in
the
officers
and
above
all
in
the
builders
which
was
the
more
creditable
to
us
as
in
the
beginning
we
were
handicapped
by
the
fact
that
the
british
already
had
a
considerable
number
of
war
vessels
while
we
had
but
one
the
falls
of
niagara
interrupt
navigation
between
erie
and
ontario
so
there
were
three
independent
centres
of
naval
operations
on
the
northern
frontier
the
first
was
on
lake
champlain
where
only
the
americans
possessed
any
force
and
singularly
enough
this
was
the
only
place
where
the
british
showed
more
enterprise
in
than
we
did
next
came
lake
ontario
where
both
sides
made
their
greatest
efforts
but
where
the
result
was
indecisive
though
the
balance
of
success
was
slightly
inclined
toward
us
our
naval
station
was
at
sackett
harbor
that
of
our
foes
at
kingston
the
third
field
of
operations
was
lake
erie
and
the
waters
above
it
here
both
sides
showed
equal
daring
and
skill
in
the
fighting
and
our
advantage
must
be
ascribed
to
the
energy
and
success
with
which
we
built
and
equipped
vessels
originally
we
had
no
force
at
all
on
these
waters
while
several
vessels
were
opposed
to
us
it
is
a
matter
of
wonder
that
the
british
and
canadian
governments
should
have
been
so
supine
as
to
permit
their
existing
force
to
go
badly
armed
and
so
unenterprising
as
to
build
but
one
additional
ship
when
they
could
easily
have
preserved
their
superiority
it
is
very
difficult
to
give
a
full
and
fair
account
of
the
lake
campaigns
the
inland
navies
were
created
especially
for
the
war
and
after
it
were
allowed
to
decay
so
that
the
records
of
the
tonnage
armament
and
crews
are
hard
to
get
at
of
course
where
everything
had
to
be
created
the
services
could
not
have
the
regular
character
of
those
on
the
ocean
the
vessels
employed
were
of
widely
different
kinds
and
this
often
renders
it
almost
impossible
to
correctly
estimate
the
relative
force
of
two
opposing
squadrons
while
the
americans
were
building
their
lake
navy
they
as
makeshifts
made
use
of
some
ordinary
merchant
schooners
which
were
purchased
and
fitted
up
with
one
or
two
long
heavy
guns
each
these
had
no
quarters
and
suffered
under
all
the
other
disadvantages
which
make
a
merchant
vessel
inferior
to
a
regularly
constructed
the
chief
trouble
was
that
in
a
heavy
sea
they
had
a
strong
tendency
to
capsize
and
were
so
unsteady
that
the
guns
could
not
be
aimed
when
any
wind
was
blowing
now
if
a
few
of
these
schooners
mounting
long
encountered
a
couple
of
brigs
armed
with
carronades
which
side
was
strongest
in
smooth
water
the
schooners
had
the
advantage
and
in
rough
weather
they
were
completely
at
the
mercy
of
the
brigs
so
that
it
would
be
very
hard
to
get
at
the
true
worth
of
such
a
contest
as
each
side
would
be
tolerably
sure
to
insist
that
the
weather
was
such
as
to
give
a
great
advantage
to
the
other
in
all
the
battles
and
skirmishes
on
champlain
erie
and
huron
at
least
there
was
no
room
left
for
doubt
as
to
who
were
the
victors
but
on
lake
ontario
there
was
never
any
decisive
struggle
and
whenever
an
encounter
occurred
each
commodore
always
claimed
that
his
adversary
had
declined
the
combat
though
much
superior
in
strength
it
is
of
course
almost
impossible
to
rind
out
which
really
did
decline
the
combat
for
the
official
letters
flatly
contradict
each
other
and
it
is
often
almost
as
difficult
to
discover
where
the
superiority
in
force
lay
when
the
fleets
differed
so
widely
in
character
as
was
the
case
in
then
commodore
chauncy
squadron
consisted
largely
of
schooners
their
long
heavy
guns
made
his
total
foot
up
in
a
very
imposing
manner
and
similar
did
very
good
work
on
lake
erie
so
commodore
yeo
and
more
especially
commodore
yeo
admirers
exalted
these
schooners
to
the
skies
and
conveyed
the
impression
that
they
were
most
formidable
craft
by
means
of
which
chauncy
ought
to
have
won
great
victories
yet
when
yeo
captured
two
of
them
he
refused
to
let
them
even
cruise
with
his
fleet
and
they
were
sent
back
to
act
as
coast
and
transports
which
certainly
would
not
have
been
done
had
they
been
fitted
to
render
any
effectual
assistance
again
one
night
a
squall
came
on
and
the
two
largest
schooners
went
to
the
bottom
which
did
not
tend
to
increase
the
confidence
felt
in
the
others
so
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
all
but
very
smooth
water
the
schooners
could
almost
be
counted
out
of
the
fight
then
the
question
arises
in
any
given
case
was
the
water
smooth
and
the
testimony
is
as
conflicting
as
ever
it
is
not
too
easy
to
reconcile
the
official
letters
of
the
commanders
and
it
is
still
harder
to
get
at
the
truth
from
either
the
american
or
british
histories
cooper
is
very
inexact
and
moreover
paints
every
thing
de
paying
no
attention
to
the
british
side
of
the
question
and
distributing
so
much
praise
to
everybody
that
one
is
at
a
loss
to
know
where
it
really
belongs
still
he
is
very
useful
for
he
lived
at
the
time
of
the
events
he
narrates
and
could
get
much
information
about
them
at
first
hand
from
the
actors
themselves
james
is
almost
the
only
british
authority
on
the
subject
but
he
is
not
nearly
as
reliable
as
when
dealing
with
the
ocean
contests
most
of
this
part
of
his
work
being
taken
up
with
a
succession
of
acrid
soliloquies
on
the
moral
defects
of
the
american
character
the
british
records
for
this
extraordinary
service
on
the
lakes
were
not
at
all
carefully
kept
and
so
james
is
not
hampered
by
the
necessity
of
adhering
more
or
less
closely
to
official
documents
but
lets
his
imagination
run
loose
on
the
ocean
and
seaboard
his
account
of
the
british
force
can
generally
be
relied
upon
but
on
the
lakes
his
authority
is
questionable
in
every
thing
relating
either
to
friends
or
foes
this
is
the
more
exasperating
because
it
is
done
wilfully
when
if
he
had
chosen
he
could
have
written
an
invaluable
history
he
must
often
have
known
the
truth
when
as
a
matter
of
preference
he
chose
either
to
suppress
or
alter
it
thus
he
ignores
all
the
small
cutting
out
expeditions
in
which
the
americans
were
successful
and
where
one
would
like
to
hear
the
british
side
for
example
captain
yeo
captured
two
schooners
the
and
but
chauncy
recaptured
both
we
have
the
american
account
of
this
recapture
in
full
but
james
does
not
even
hint
at
it
and
blandly
puts
down
both
vessels
in
the
total
american
loss
at
the
end
of
his
smaller
work
worse
still
when
the
again
changed
hands
he
counts
it
in
again
in
the
total
as
if
it
were
an
entirely
different
boat
although
he
invariably
rules
out
of
the
american
list
all
recaptured
vessels
a
more
serious
perversion
of
facts
are
his
statements
about
comparative
tonnage
this
was
at
that
time
measured
arbitrarily
the
depth
of
hold
being
estimated
at
half
the
breadth
of
beam
and
the
tonnage
of
our
lake
vessels
was
put
down
exactly
as
if
they
were
regular
ocean
cruisers
of
the
same
dimensions
in
length
and
breadth
but
on
these
inland
seas
the
vessels
really
did
not
draw
more
than
half
as
much
water
as
on
the
ocean
and
the
depth
would
of
course
be
much
less
james
in
comparing
the
tonnage
gives
that
of
the
americans
as
if
they
were
regular
ocean
ships
but
in
the
case
of
the
british
vessels
carefully
allows
for
their
shallowness
although
professing
to
treat
the
two
classes
in
the
same
way
and
thus
he
makes
out
a
most
striking
and
purely
imaginary
difference
the
best
example
is
furnished
by
his
accounts
of
the
fleets
on
lake
erie
the
captured
vessels
were
appraised
by
two
captains
and
the
henry
eckford
their
tonnage
being
computed
precisely
as
the
tonnage
of
the
american
vessels
the
appraisement
was
recorded
in
the
navy
department
and
was
first
made
public
by
cooper
so
that
it
could
not
have
been
done
for
effect
thus
measured
it
was
found
that
the
tonnage
was
in
round
numbers
as
follows
tons
james
makes
them
measure
respectively
and
tons
but
carefully
gives
the
american
ships
the
regular
sea
tonnage
so
also
he
habitually
deducts
about
percent
from
the
real
number
of
men
on
board
the
british
ships
as
regards
lake
erie
he
contradicts
himself
so
much
that
he
does
not
need
to
be
exposed
from
outside
sources
but
the
most
glaring
and
least
excusable
misstatements
are
made
as
to
the
battle
of
lake
champlain
where
he
gives
the
american
as
greatly
exceeding
the
british
force
he
reaches
this
conclusion
by
the
most
marvellous
series
of
garblings
and
misstatements
first
he
says
that
the
and
the
were
of
nearly
equal
tonnage
the
being
captured
was
placed
on
our
naval
lists
where
for
years
she
ranked
as
a
frigate
while
the
ranked
among
the
corvettes
and
by
actual
measurement
the
former
was
half
as
large
again
as
the
latter
he
gives
the
but
men
one
of
her
officers
in
a
letter
published
in
the
naval
footnote
vol
xxxii
the
letter
also
says
that
hardly
five
of
her
men
remained
unhurt
gives
her
over
more
than
that
number
of
dead
and
prisoners
were
taken
out
of
her
he
misstates
the
calibre
of
her
guns
and
counts
out
two
of
them
because
they
were
used
through
the
whereas
from
the
method
in
which
she
made
her
attack
these
would
have
been
peculiarly
effective

on
board

minutes
after

who
was

months

james
states
that
there
were

british
gallies

sir
george

official
account
as
well

all
the
american
authorities
state
the

says
that
the
grounded
opposite
an
american
battery
before
the
engagement
began
while
in
reality
it
was
an
hour
afterward
and
because
she
had
been
disabled
by
the
shot
of
the
american
fleet
the
gallies
were
largely
manned
by
canadians
and
james
anxious
to
put
the
blame
on
these
rather
than
the
british
says
that
they
acted
in
the
most
cowardly
way
whereas
in
reality
they
caused
the
americans
more
trouble
than
downie
smaller
sailing
vessels
did
his
account
of
the
armament
of
these
vessels
differs
widely
from
the
official
reports
he
gives
the
and
a
smaller
number
of
men
than
the
number
of
prisoners
that
were
actually
taken
out
of
them
not
including
the
dead
even
misstating
downie
force
in
guns
underestimating
the
number
of
his
men
and
leaving
out
two
of
his
did
not
content
james
and
to
make
the
figures
show
a
proper
disproportion
he
says
vol
vi
that
he
shall
exclude
the
from
the
estimate
because
she
grounded
and
half
of
the
because
he
does
not
think
they
acted
bravely
even
were
these
assertions
true
it
would
be
quite
as
logical
for
an
american
writer
to
put
the
crew
down
as
only
and
say
he
should
exclude
the
other
men
from
the
estimate
because
they
flinched
and
to
exclude
all
the
guns
that
were
disabled
by
shot
would
be
no
worse
than
to
exclude
the
manipulation
of
the
figures
is
a
really
curious
piece
of
audacity
naturally
subsequent
british
historians
have
followed
him
without
inquiry
james
account
of
this
battle
alone
amply
justifies
our
rejecting
his
narrative
entirely
as
far
as
affairs
on
the
lakes
go
whenever
it
conflicts
with
any
other
statement
british
or
american
even
when
it
does
not
conflict
it
must
be
followed
with
extreme
caution
for
whenever
he
goes
into
figures
the
only
thing
certain
about
them
is
that
they
are
wrong
he
gives
no
details
at
all
of
most
of
the
general
actions
of
these
however
we
already
possess
excellent
accounts
the
best
being
those
in
the
manual
of
naval
tactics
by
commander
ward
and
in

of
the

cooper
naval
history
the
chief
difficulty
occurs
in
connection
with
matters
on
lake
ontario
footnote
the
accounts
of
the
two
commanders
on
lake
ontario
are
as
difficult
to
reconcile
as
are
those
of
the
contending
admirals
in
the
battles
which
the
dutch
waged
against
the
english
and
french
during
the
years
in
every
one
of
de
ruyter
last
six
battles
each
side
regularly
claimed
the
victory
although
there
can
be
but
little
doubt
that
on
the
whole
the
strategical
and
probably
the
tactical
advantage
remained
with
de
ruyter
every
historian
ought
to
feel
a
sense
of
the
most
lively
gratitude
toward
nelson
in
his
various
encounters
he
never
left
any
possible
room
for
dispute
as
to
which
side
had
come
out
first
best
where
i
have
been
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
a
perfect
patchwork
of
authors
and
even
newspapers
for
the
details
using

james
as
mutual
correctives
the
armaments
and
equipments
being
so
irregular
i
have
not
as
in
other
cases
made
any
allowance
for
the
short
weight
of
the
americans
shot
as
here
the
british
may
have
suffered
under
a
similar
disadvantage
and
it
may
be
as
well
to
keep
in
mind
that
on
these
inland
waters
the
seamen
of
the
two
navies
seem
to
have
been
as
evenly
matched
in
courage
and
skill
as
was

they
were
of
exactly
the

stock

the
sole
exception

independent
centres

canadian
squadron

too
strong
to

largest
vessel

she
would
have
been
perfectly
competent
to
take
both
the

before
the
canadian
commodore
earle
made
up
his
mind
to
attack
lieut
woolsey
had
time
to
make
one
or
two
short
cruises

some
damage
among
the
merchant
vessels
of
the
enemy
on
the
of
july
earle
ships
appeared
off
the
harbor
the

such
a
dull
sailor
that
it
was
useless
for
her
to
try
to
escape

she
was
hauled
up
under
a
bank
where
she
raked
the
entrance
and
her
off

landed
and
mounted
on
the
shore
while
lieut
woolsey
took

a

about
an

who
manifested
the
most
indefatigable
industry
in
intermittently
changing
the

name
of
almost
every
vessel

the
records
being
very
loosely

any
one

of

would

work

in

more

were

the
following
spring

was
composed
solely
of

double

it
was
during
the
ensuing
summer
the
americans
could
not
have
stirred
out
of
port
but
as
it
was
it
merely
served
as
a
kind
of
water
militia
the
very
sailors
who
subsequently
did
well

then
almost
useless
and
unable
to
oppose
their
foes
though
the
latter
were
so
inferior
in
number

the
reason
that
it
was
thus
practically
a
contest
of
regulars
against
militia

shall
not
give
numerical
comparisons
of
the
skirmishes
in
the
autumn
of

shall
touch
on
them

slightly
they
teach
the
old
lesson
that
whether
by
sea
or
land
a
small
and
force
can
not
except
very
rarely
be
resisted
by
a
greater
number
of
mere
militia
and
that
in
the
end
it
is
true
economy
to
have
the
regular
force
prepared
beforehand
without
waiting
until
we
have
been
forced
to
prepare
it
by
the
disasters
happening
to
the
irregulars
the
canadian
seamen
behaved
badly
but
no
worse
than
the
american
did

the
same

nations

men
completely
breaking
up

the
cruise
was
something
in
modern
warfare
recalling
to
mind
the
cruises
of
the
early
english
and
dutch
navigators
an
american
ship
was
at
a
serious
disadvantage
in
having
no
harbor
of
refuge
away
from
home
while
on
almost
every
sea
there
were
british
french
and
spanish
ports
into
which
vessels
of
those
nations
could
run
for
safety
it
was
an
unprecedented
thing
for
a
small
frigate
to
cruise
a
year
and
a
half
in
enemy
waters
and
to
supply
herself
during
that
time
purely
from
captured
vessels
with
every
thing
cordage
sails
guns
anchors
provisions
and
medicines

even
money

the
been
decently
armed

instead
of
carronades
the
end
might
have
been
as
successful
as
it
was
glorious
the
whalers
were
many
of
them
armed
and
though
of
course
unable
to
oppose
the
frigate
several
times
smart
skirmishes
occurred
in

them

is
worth
noticing

an
instance

the
way
james
alters
a
fact
by
suppressing
half
of
it
meanwhile
rodgers
cruised
along
the
eastern
edge
of
the
grand
bank
until
he
reached
latitude
without
meeting
any
thing
then
stood
to
the
southeast
and
cruised
off

june
then
he
crowded
sail
to
the
northeast
after
a
jamaica
fleet

which
he
had
received

which
he
failed
to
overtake

on

gave
up

chase

shaped
his
course
toward
the
north

still
without
any
good
luck
befalling
him
on
june
he
put
into

bergen
in

thence
passed

intercept

quotes
from
the
logs
of
the
two
british
ships
and
it
would
seem
that
he
is
correct
as
it
would
not
be
possible
for
him
to
falsify
the
logs
so
utterly
in
case
he
is
true
it
was
certainly
carrying
caution
to
an
excessive
degree
for
the
commodore
to
retreat
before
getting
some
idea
of
what
his
antagonists
really
were
his
mistaking
them
for
so
much
heavier
ships
was
a
precisely
similar
error
to
that
made
by
sir
george
collier
and
lord
stuart
at
a
later
date
about
the

james
wishes
to
prove
that
each
party
perceived
the
force
of
the
other
and
draws
a
contrast
between
the
gallantry
of
one
party
and
pusillanimity
of
the
other
this
is
nonsense
and
as
in
similar
cases
james
overreaches
himself
by
proving
too
much
if
he
had
made
an
frigate
like

narrative
would
be
within
the

examination

a
shot
had
been
fired
in
this
way
for
upward
of
three
years
nor
was
the
fault
wholly
the
captain
the
instructions
under
which
he
was
bound
to
act
forbade
him
to
use
during
the
first
six
months
after
the
ship
had
received
her
armament
more
shots
per
month
than
amounted
to
a
third
in
number
of
the
guns
and
after
these
six
months
only
half
the
quantity
many
captains
never
put
a
shot
in
the
guns
till
an
enemy
appeared
they
employed
the
leisure
time
of
the
men
in
handling
the
sails
and
in
decorating
the
ship
captain
broke
was
not
one
of
this
kind
from
the
day
on
which
he
had
joined
her
the
of
september
the
began
to
feel
the
effect
of
her
captain
proficiency
as
a
gunner
and
zeal
for
the
service
the
laying
of
the
ordnance
so
that
it
may
be
correctly
fired
in
a
horizontal
direction
is
justly
deemed
a
most
important
operation
as
upon
it
depends
in
a
great
measure
the
true
aim
and
destructive
effect
of
the
shot
this
was
attended
to
by
captain
broke
in
person
by
draughts
from
other
ships
and
the
usual
means
to
which
a
british
is
obliged
to
resort
the
got
together
a
crew
and
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
by
the
paternal
care
and
excellent
regulations
of
captain
broke
the
ship
company
became
as
pleasant
to
command
as
it
was
dangerous
to
meet
the
guns
were
all
carefully
sighted
and
moreover
every
day
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
forenoon
when
not
prevented
by
chase
or
the
state
of
the
weather
the
men
were
exercised
at
training
the
guns
and
for
the
same
time
in
the
afternoon
in
the
use
of
the
broadsword
pike
musket
etc
twice
a
week
the
crew
fired
at
targets
both
with
great
guns
and
musketry
and
captain
broke
as
an
additional
stimulus
beyond
the
emulation
excited
gave
a
pound
of
tobacco
to
every
man
that
put
a
shot
through
the
bull
eye
he
would
frequently
have
a
cask
thrown
overboard
and
suddenly
order
some
one
gun
to
be
manned
to
sink
the
cask
in
short
the
was
very
greatly
superior
thanks
to
her
careful
training
to
the
average
british
frigate
of
her
rate
while
the
owing
to
her
having
a
raw
and
inexperienced
crew
was
decidedly
inferior
to
the
average
american
frigate
of
the
same
strength
in
force
the
two
frigates
compared
pretty
equally

taking
each
commander
account
for
his

captain

sent
in
to
captain
lawrence
by
an
american
prisoner
a
letter
of
challenge
which
for
courteousness
manliness
and
candor
is
the
very
model
of
what
such
an
epistle
should
be
before
it
reached
boston
however
captain
lawrence
had
weighed
anchor
to
attack
the
which
frigate
was
in
full
sight
in
the
offing
it
has
been
often
said
that
he
engaged
against
his
judgment
but
this
may
be
doubted
his
experience
with
the
and
had
not
tended
to
give
him
a
very
high
idea
of
the
navy
to
which
he
was
opposed
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
confident
of
capturing
the
footnote
in
his
letter
written
just
before
sailing
already
quoted
on
he
says
an
english
frigate
is
now
in
sight
from
our
deck
i
am
in
hopes
to
give
a
good
account
of
her
before
night
my
account
of
the
action
is
mainly
taken
from
james
naval
history
and
brighton
memoir
of
admiral
broke
according
to
which
the
official
letter
of
captain
broke
was
tampered

it
was
most
unfortunate
that
he
did
not
receive
broke
letter
as
the
latter
in
it
expressed
himself
willing
to
meet
lawrence
in
any
latitude
and
longitude
he
might
appoint
and
there
would
thus
have
been
some
chance
of
the
american
crew
having
time
enough
to
get
into
shape
at
midday
of
june
the
weighed

out
of

hour
later

about
six

with

ensigns
flying

straight
for

was
afraid
that
lawrence
would
pass
under
the
stern
rake
her
and
engage
her
on
the
quarter
but
either
overlooking
or
waiving
this
advantage
the
american
captain
luffed
up
within
yards
upon
the
starboard
quarter
and
squared
his
on
board

william

not
to

doing
great
damage
but
she
herself
was
suffering
even
more
than

the

hardly

at

went
off

slowly

aboard

upon

his
foes
flinching
from

about

the

just
about

almost
all
american

unfortunate
accidents

the

its

the

it

by
fortuitous
events
as
unconnected
with
any
particular

the
worth
of
such
an
explanation
is
very
aptly
gauged
in
general
alexander
webb
the
peninsula
campaign
of
new
york
where
he
speaks
of
those
unforeseen
or
uncontrollable
agencies
which
are
vaguely
described
as
the
of
war
but
which
usually
prove
to
be
the
superior
ability
or
resources
of
the
antagonist
most
naval
men
consider
it
a
species
of
treason
to
regard
the
defeat
as
due
to
any
thing
but
extraordinary
ill
fortune
and
yet
no
disinterested
reader
can
help
acknowledging
that
the
true
reason
of
the
defeat
was
the
very
simple
one
that
the
fought
better
than
the
it
has
often
been
said
that
up
to
the
moment
when
the
ships
came
together
the
loss
and
damage
suffered
by
each
were
about
the
same
this
is
not
true
and
even
if
it
was
would
not
affect
the
question
the
heavy
loss
on
board
the
did
not
confuse
or
terrify
the
thoroughly
trained
men
with
their
implicit
reliance
on
their
leaders
and
the
experienced
officers
were
ready
to
defend
any
point
that
was
menaced
an
equal
or
greater
amount
of
loss
aboard
the
disheartened
and
confused
the
raw
crew
who
simply
had
not
had
the
time
or
chance
to
become
well
disciplined
many
of
the
old
hands
of
course
kept
their
wits
and
their
pluck
but
the
novices
and
the
disaffected
did
not
similarly
with
the
officers
some
as
the
court
of
inquiry
found
had
not
kept
to
their
posts
and
all
being
new
to
each
other
and
the
ship
could
not
show
to
their
best
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
was
beaten
at
the
guns
before
she
was
boarded
had
the
ships
not
come
together
the
fight
would
have
been
longer
the
loss
greater
and
more
nearly
equal
but
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
cooper
says
that
the
enemy
entered
with
great
caution
and
so
slowly
that
twenty
resolute
men
could
have
repulsed
him
it
was
no
proof
of
caution
for
captain
broke
and
his
few
followers
to
leap
on
board
unsupported
and
then
they
only
waited
for
the
main
body
to
come
up
and
no
twenty
men
could
have
repulsed
such
boarders
as
followed
broke
the
fight
was
another
lesson
with
the
parties
reversed
to
the
effect
that
want
of
training
and
discipline
is
a
bad
handicap
had
the
crew
been
in
service
as
many
months
as
the
had
been
years
such
a
captain
as
lawrence
would
have
had
his
men
perfectly
in
hand
they
would
not
have
been
cowed
by
their
losses
nor
some
of
the
officers
too
demoralized
to
act
properly
and
the
material
advantages
which
the
possessed
although
not
very
great
would
probably
have
been
enough
to
give
her
a
good
chance
of
victory
it
is
well
worth
noticing
that
the
only
thoroughly
disciplined
set
of
men
aboard
all
according
to
james
himself
by
the
way
native
americans
namely
the
marines
did
excellently
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
three
fourths
of
their
number
were
among
the
killed
and
wounded
the
foreigners
aboard
the
did
not
do
as
well
as
the
americans
but
it
is
nonsense
to
ascribe
the
defeat
in
any
way
to
them
it
was
only
rendered
rather
more
disastrous
by
their
actions
most
of
the
english
authors
give
very
fair
accounts
of
the
battle
except
that
they
hardly
allude
to
the
peculiar
disadvantages
under
which
the
suffered
when
she
entered
into
it
thus
james
thinks
the
was
unprepared
because
she
had
only
been
to
sea
six
weeks
but
does
not
lay
any
weight
on
the
fact
that
the
had
been
out
only
as
many
hours
altogether
the
best
criticism
on
the
fight
is
that
written
by
de
la
gravi√®re
footnote
guerres
maritimes
ii
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
seeing
in
the
capture
of
the
a
new
proof
of
the
enormous
power
of
a
good
organization
when
it
has
received
the
consecration
of
a
few
years
actual
service
on
the
sea
on
this
occasion
in
effect
two
captains
equally
renowned
the
honor
of
two
navies
were
opposed
to
each
other
on
two
ships
of
the
same
tonnage
and
number
of
guns
never
had
the
chances
seemed
better
balanced
but
sir
philip
broke
had
commanded
the
for
nearly
seven
years
while
captain
lawrence
had
only
commanded
the
for
a
few
days
the
first
of
these
frigates
had
cruised
for
eighteen
months
on
the
coast
of
america
the
second
was
leaving
port
one
had
a
crew
long
accustomed
to
habits
of
strict
obedience
the
other
was
manned
by
men
who
had
just
been
engaged
in
mutiny
the
americans
were
wrong
to
accuse
fortune
on
this
occasion
fortune
was
not
fickle
she
was
merely
logical
the
captured
the
on
the
first
of
june
but
on
the
of
september
the
day
when
he
took
command
of
his
frigate
captain
broke
had
begun
to
prepare
the
glorious
termination
to
this
bloody
affair
hard
as
it
is
to
breathe
a
word
against
such
a
man
as
lawrence
a
very
bayard
of
the
seas
who
was
admired
as
much
for
his
dauntless
bravery
as
he
was
loved
for
his
gentleness
and
uprightness
it
must
be
confessed
that
he
acted
rashly
and
after
he
had
sailed
it
was
as
lord
howard
douglass
has
pointed
out
a
tactical
error
however
chivalric
to
neglect
the
chance
of
luffing
across
the
stern
to
rake
her
exactly
as
it
was
a
tactical
error
of
his
equally
chivalrous
antagonist
to
have
let
him
have
such
an
opportunity
hull
would
not
have
committed
either
error
and
would
for
the
matter
of
that
have
been
an
overmatch
for
either
commander
but
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
lawrence
encounters
with
the
english
had
not
been
such
as
to
give
him
a
high
opinion
of
them
the
only
foe
he
had
fought
had
been
inferior
in
strength
it
is
true
but
had
hardly
made
any
effective
resistance
another
sloop
of
equal
if
not
superior
force
had
tamely
submitted
to
blockade
for
several
days
and
had
absolutely
refused
to
fight
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
unprepared
though
she
was
would
have
been
an
overmatch
for
the
or
altogether
it
is
hard
to
blame
lawrence
for
going
out
and
in
every
other
respect
his
actions
never
have
been
nor
will
be
mentioned
by
either
friend
or
foe
without
the
warmest
respect
but
that
is
no
reason
for
insisting
that
he
was
ruined
purely
by
an
adverse
fate
we
will
do
far
better
to
recollect
that
as
much
can
be
learned
from
reverses
as
from
victories
instead
of
flattering
ourselves
by
saying
the
defeat
was
due
to
chance
let
us
try
to
find
out
what
the
real
cause
was
and
then
take
care
that
it
does
not
have
an
opportunity
to
act
again
a
little
less
rashness
would
have
saved
lawrence
life
and
his
frigate
while
a
little
more
audacity
on
one
occasion
would
have
made
commodore
chauncy
famous
for
ever
and
whether
a
lesson
is
to
be
learned
or
not
a
historian
should
remember
that
his
profession
is
not
that
of
a
panegyrist
the
facts
of
the
case
unquestionably
are
that
captain
broke
in
fair
fight
within
sight
of
the
harbor
proved
conqueror
over
a
nominally
equal
and
in
reality
slightly
superior
force
and
that
this
is
the
only
action
of
the
war
in
which
the
victor
was
weaker
in
force
than
his
opponent
so
much
can
be
gathered
by
reading
only
the
american
accounts
moreover
accident
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
gaining
of
the
victory
the
explanation
is
perfectly
easy
lawrence
and
broke
were
probably
exactly
equal
in
almost
every
thing
that
goes
to
make
up
a
commander
but
one
had
trained
his
crew
for
seven
years
and
the
other
was
new
to
the
ship
to
the
officers
and
to
the
men
and
the
last
to
each
other
the
crew
must
have
been
of
fine
material
or
they
would
not
have
fought
so
well
as
they
did
so
much
for
the
american
accounts
on
the
other
hand
the
capture
of
the
was
and
is
held
by
many
british
historians
to
conclusively
prove
a
good
many
different
things
such
as
that
if
the
odds
were
anything
like
equal
a
british
frigate
could
always
whip
an
american
that
in
a
conflict
such
would
invariably
be
the
case
etc
and
as
this
was
the
only
action
of
the
war
in
which
the
victor
was
the
inferior
in
force
most
british
writers
insist
that
it
reflected
more
honor
on
them
than
all
the
frigate
actions
of
put
together
did
on
the
americans
these
assertions
can
be
best
appreciated
by
reference
to
a
victory
won
by
the
french

the
year
of
the
battle
of

makes
the
difference
even
greater
at
any
rate
the
english
vessel
was
vastly
the
superior
in
force
and
was
captured
by
boarding
after
a
long
and
bloody
conflict
in
which
she
lost
and
her
antagonist
over
men
during
all
the
wars
waged
with
the
republic

the
empire
no

vessel
captured
a
french
one
as

superior

capturing
their

fleets

in

captured

in

themselves
they
were
utterly
useless

calm

in

the
heavy
guns
caused
them
to
careen
over
so
as
to
make
it
difficult
to
keep
them
right
side
up
and
impossible
to
fire
even
in
smooth
water
they
could
not
be
fought
at
anchor

to
be
kept
in
position
by
means
of
sweeps

they
were
very
unstable

recoil
of
the
guns

them
to
roll
so
as
to
make
it
difficult

aim

any
accuracy

first
discharge

a
single
shot

put

this
last
event
rarely
happened
however
for
they
were
not
often
handled
with
any
approach
to
temerity
and
on
the
contrary
usually
made
their
attacks
at
a
range
that
rendered
it
as
impossible
to
inflict
as
to
receive
harm
it
does
not
seem
as
if
they
were
very
well
managed
but
they
were
such
craft
that
the
best
officers
might
be
pardoned
for
feeling
uncomfortable

ill
used
it
was
not
even
as
if
her
antagonist
had
been
an
unusually
fine
vessel
of
her
class
the
did
not
do
as
well
as
either
the
previously
or
the
afterward
though
perhaps
rather
better
than
the
or
with
a
comparatively
unmanageable
antagonist
in
smooth
water
she
ought
to
have
sunk
her
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
but
the
not
having
done
particularly
well
merely
makes
the
conduct
of
the
americans
look
worse
it
is
just
the
reverse
of
the
case
where
paying
the
highest
credit
to
the
british
we
still
thought
the
fight
no
discredit
to
us
here
we
can
indulge
no
such
reflection
the
officers
did
well
but
the
crew
did
not
cooper
says
the
enemy
was
so
much
heavier
that
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
would
have
captured
her
antagonist
under
any
ordinary
circumstances
this
i
doubt
such
a
crew
as
the
or
probably
would
have
been
successful
the
trouble
with
the
guns
of
the
was
not
so
much
that
they
were
too
small
as
that
they
did
not
hit
and
this
seems
all
the
more
incomprehensible
when
it
is
remembered
that
captain
allen
is
the
very
man
to
whom
commodore
decatur
in
his
official
letter
attributed
the
skilful
of
the
crew
of
the
frigate
cooper
says
that
the
powder
was
bad
and
it
has
also
been
said
that
the
men
of
the
were
and
were
drunk
in
which
case
they
ought
not
to
have
been
brought
into
action
besides
unskilfulness
there
is
another
very
serious
count
against
the
crew
had
the
been
some
distance
from
the
and
in
a
position
where
she
could
pour
in
her
fire
with
perfect
impunity
to
herself
when
the
surrender
took
place
it
would
have
been
more
justifiable
but
on
the
contrary
the
vessels
were
touching
and
the
british
boarded
just
as
the
colors
were
hauled
down
it
was
certainly
very
disgraceful
that
the
americans
did
not
rally
to
repel
them
for
they
had
still
four
fifths
of
their
number
absolutely
untouched
they
certainly
to
have
succeeded
for
boarding
is
a
difficult
and
dangerous
experiment
and
if
they
had
repulsed
their
antagonists
they
might
in
turn
have
carried
the
so
that
in
summing
up
the
merits
of
this
action
it
is
fair
to
say
that
both
sides
showed
skilful
seamanship
and
unskilful
gunnery
that
the
british
fought
bravely
and
that
the
americans
did
not
it
is
somewhat
interesting
to
compare
this
fight
where
a
weaker
american
sloop
was
taken
by
a
stronger
british
one
with
two
or
three
others
where
both
the
comparative
force
and
the
result
were
reversed
comparing
it
therefore
with
the
actions
between
the
and
british
the
and
and
the
american
and
we
get
four
actions
in
one
of
which
the
the
british
were
victorious
and
in
the
other
three
the
americans
comparative
comparative
loss

it
is
thus
seen
that
in

the
superiority

on
the
side
of
the
victor
was
each
time
about
the
same

a
much
more
effectual
resistance

while
the

her
work
in
poorer
form
than
either
of
the
victorious
american
sloops
and
on
the
other
hand
the
resistance
of
the
did
not
by
any
means
show
as
much
bravery
as
was
shown
in
the
defence
of
the
or
although
rather
more
than
in
the
case
of
the
this
is
the
only
action
of
the
war
where
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
out
the
cause
of
the
inferiority
of
the
beaten
crew
in
almost
all
other
cases
we
find
that
one
crew
had
been
carefully
drilled
and
so
proved
superior
to
a
antagonist
but
it
is
incredible
that
the
man
to
whose
exertions
when
first
lieutenant
of
the
commodore
decatur
ascribes
the
skilfulness
of
that
ship
men
should
have
neglected
to
train
his
own
crew
and
this
had
the
reputation
of
being
composed
of
a
fine
set
of
men
bad
powder
would
not
account
for
the
surrender
of
the
when
so
little
damaged
it
really
seems
as
if
the
men
have
been
drunk
or
as
has
been
so
often
asserted
of
course
drunkenness
would
account
for
the
defeat
although
not
in
the
least
altering
its
humiliating
character
et
tu
quoque
is
not
much
of
an
argument
still
it
may
be
as
well
to
call
to
mind
here
two
engagements
in
which
british
sloops
suffered
much
more
discreditable
defeats
than
the
did
the
figures
are
taken
from
james
as
given
by
the
french
historians
they
make
even
a
worse
showing
for
the
british
a
short
time
before
our
war
the
british
brig
had
been
captured
by
boarding
by
the
french
brig
and
the
british
brig
had
been
captured
also
by
boarding
by
the
corvette
the
following
was
the
comparative
force
of
the
combatants
weight
metal
no
crew
loss
in
spite
of
the
pride
the
british
take
in
their
prowess
both
of
these
ships
were
captured
by
boarding
the
was
captured
by
a
much
smaller
force
instead
of
by
a
much
larger
one
as
in
the
case
of
the
and
if
the
gave
up
before
she
had
suffered
greatly
the
surrendered
when
she
had
suffered
still
less
french
historians
asserted
that
the
capture
of
the
two
brigs
proved
that
french
valor
could
conquer
british
courage
and
a
similar
opinion
was
very
complacently
expressed
by
british
historians
after
the
defeat
of
the
all
that
the
three
combats
really
proved
was
that
in
eight
encounters
between
british
and
american
sloops
the
americans
were
defeated
once
and
in
a
far
greater
number
of
encounters
between
french
and
british
sloops
the
british
were
defeated
twice
no
one
pretends
that
either
navy
was
invincible
the
question
is
which
side
averaged
best
at
the
opening
of
the
war
we
possessed
several
small
brigs
these
had
originally
been
fast
handy
little
schooners
each
armed
with
long
sixes
and
with
a
crew
of
men
as
such
they
were
effective
enough
but
when
afterward
changed
into
brigs
each
armed
with
a
couple
of
extra
guns
and
given
additional
men
they
became
too
slow
to
run
without
becoming
strong
enough
to
fight
they
carried
far
too
many
guns
and
men
for
their
size
and
not
enough
to
give
them
a
chance
with
any
respectable
opponent
and
they
were
almost
all
ignominiously
captured
the
single
exception
was
the
brig
she
managed
to
escape
capture
owing
chiefly
to
good
luck
and
once
fought
a
victorious
engagement
thanks
to
the
fact
that
the
british
possessed
a
class
of
vessels
even
worse
than
our
own
she
was
kept
near
the
land
and
finally
took
up
her
station

the
eastern
coast

she
did
good
service

chasing
away

capturing
the
various

ones

the
superiority

that

trained

his
defeat
in

pointed
exactly
the

way

the
folly
of
taking
a
raw
levy
out

constructed

meet

any

the
advantage

one
of
james
most
comical
misstatements
is
that
on
the
lakes
the
american
sailors
were
all
picked
men
on
for
example
in
speaking
of
the
battle
of
lake
erie
he
says
commodore
perry
had
picked
crews
to
all
his
vessels
as
a
matter
of
fact
perry
had
once
sent
in
his
resignation
solely
on
account
of
the
very
poor
quality
of
his
crews
and
had
with
difficulty
been
induced
to
withdraw
it
perry
crews
were
of
hardly
average
excellence
but
then
the
average
american
sailor
was
a
very
good
specimen
however
the
work
went
on
in
spite
of
interruptions
fresh
gangs
of
shipwrights
arrived
and
largely
owing
to
the
energy
and
capacity
of
the
head

henry

did
as

as
any

sir
george
prevost
the
british
commander
in
canada
had
ordered
two
ships
to
be
built
and
they
were
begun
but
he
committed
the
mistake
of
having
one
laid
down
in
kingston
and
the
other
in
york
at
the
opposite
end
of
the

earle
the
canadian
commodore

himself

incompetent

the
comparative
force
of
the
two
fleets
or
squadrons
it
is
hard
to
estimate
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
difficulty
in
finding
out
what
guns
were
mounted
on
any
given
ship
at
a
particular
time
and
it
is
even
more
perplexing
with
the
crews
a
schooner
would
make
one
cruise
with
but
thirty
hands
on
the
next
it
would
appear
with
fifty
a
number
of
militia
having
volunteered
as
marines
finding
the
militia
rather
a
nuisance
they
would
be
sent
ashore
and
on
her
third
cruise
the
schooner
would
substitute
half
a
dozen
frontier
seamen
in
their
place
it
was
the
same
with
the
larger
vessels
the
might
at
one
time
have
her
full
complement
of
men
a
month
sickness
would
ensue
and
she
would
sail
with
but
effectives
the
crew
of
men
at
one
time
would
shortly
afterward
be
less
by
a
third
in
consequence
of
a
draft
of
sailors
being
sent
to
the
upper
lakes
so
it
is
almost
impossible
to
be
perfectly
accurate
but
making
a
comparison
of
the
various
authorities
from
lieutenant
emmons
to
james
the
following
tables
of
the

may
be
given

this

from
james
who
gives

throwing

but
only
men
as
the
evidence
in
the
held
on
captain
barclay
and
the
official
accounts
on
both
sides
of
macdonough
victory
convict
him
of
very
much
underrating
the
force
in
men
of
the
british
on
erie
and
champlain
it
can
be
safely
assumed
that
he
has
underestimated
the
force
in
men
on
lake
ontario
by
comparing
the
tonnage
he
gives
to
and
downie
squadrons
with
what
it
really
was
we
can
correct
his
account
of
yeo
tonnage
the
above
figures
would
apparently
make
the
two
squadrons
about
equal
chauncy
having
men
more
and
throwing
at
a
broadside
pounds
shot
less
than
his
antagonist
but
the
figures
do
not
by
any
means
show
all
the
truth
the
americans
greatly
excelled
in
the
number
and
calibre
of
their
long
guns
compared
thus
they
threw
at
one
discharge
pounds
of
metal
and
pounds
of
carronade
metal
while
the
british
only
threw
from
their
long
guns
pounds
and
from
their
carronades
this
unequal
distribution
of
metal
was
very
much
in
favor
of
the
americans
nor
was
this
all
the
with
her
long
in
battery
was
an
overmatch
for
any
one
of
the
enemy
vessels
and
bore
the
same
relation
to
them
that
the
at
a
later
date
did
to
macdonough
squadron
she
should
certainly
have
been
a
match
for
the
and
together
and
the
and
for
the
and
in
fact
the
three
heavy
american
vessels
ought
to
have
been
an
overmatch
for
the
four
heaviest
of
the
british
squadron
although
these
possessed
the
nominal
superiority
and
in
ordinary
cases
the
eight
remaining
american
would
certainly
seem
to
be
an
overmatch
for
the
two
british
schooners
but
it
is
just
here
that
the
difficulty
of
comparing
the
forces
comes
in
when
the
water
was
very
smooth
and
the
wind
light
the
long
and
of
the
americans
could
play
havoc
with
the
british
schooners
at
a
distance
which
would
render
the
carronades
of
the
latter
useless
but
the
latter
were
built
for
war
possessed
quarters
and
were
good
cruisers
while
chauncy
schooners
were
merchant
vessels
without
quarters
crank
and
so
loaded
down
with
heavy
metal
that
whenever
it
blew
at
all
hard
they
could
with
difficulty
be
kept
from
upsetting
and
ceased
to
be
capable
even
of
defending
themselves
when
sir
james
yeo
captured
two
of
them
he
would
not
let
them
cruise
with
his
other
vessels
at
all
but
sent
them
back
to
act
as
in
which
capacity
they
were
serving
when
recaptured
this
is
a
tolerable
test
of
their
value
compared
to
their
opponents
another
disadvantage
that
chauncy
had
to
contend
with
was
the
difference
in
the
speed
of
the
various
vessels
the
and
were
fast
weatherly
ships
but
the
was
a
perfect
slug
even
going
free
and
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
beat
to
windward
at
all
in
this
respect
yeo
was
much
better
off
his
six
ships
were
regular
with
quarters
all
of
them
seaworthy
and
fast
enough
to
be
able
to
act
with
uniformity
and
not
needing
to
pay
much
regard
to
the
weather
his
force
could
act
as
a
unit
but
chauncy
could
not
enough
wind
to
make
a
good
working
breeze
for
his
larger
vessels
put
all
his
smaller
ones
de
and
in
weather
that
suited
the
latter
the
former
could
not
move
about
at
all
when
speed
became
necessary
the
two
ships
left
the
brig
hopelessly
behind
and
either
had
to
do
without
her
or
else
perhaps
let
the
critical
moment
slip
by
while
waiting
for
her
to
come
up
some
of
the
schooners
sailed
quite
as
slowly
and
finally
it
was
found
out
that
the
only
way
to
get
all
the
vessels
into
action
at
once
was
to
have
one
half
the
fleet
tow
the
other
half
it
was
certainly
difficult
to
keep
the
command
of
the
lake
when
if
it
came
on
to
blow
the
commodore
had
to
put
into
port
under
penalty
of
seeing
a
quarter
of
his
fleet
founder
before
his
eyes
these
conflicting
considerations
render
it
hard
to
pass
judgment
but
on
the
whole
it
would
seem
as
if
chauncy
was
the
superior
in
force
for
even
if
his
schooners
were
not
counted
his
three
vessels
were
at
least
a
match
for
the
four
british
vessels
and
the
two
british
schooners
would
not
have
counted
very
much
in
such
a
conflict
in
calm
weather
he
was
certainly
the
superior
this
only
solves
one
of
the
points
in
which
the
official
letters
of
the
two
commanders
differ
after
every
meeting
each
one
insists
that
he
was
inferior
in
force
that
the
weather
suited
his
antagonist
and
that
the
latter
ran
away
and
got
the
worst
of
it
all
of
which
will
be
considered
further
on
in
order
to
settle
toward
which
side
the
balance
of
success
inclined
we
must
remember
that
there
were
two
things
the
combatants
were
trying
to
do
viz
to
damage
the
enemy
directly
by
capturing
or
destroying
his
vessels
this
was
the
only
object
we
had
in
view
in
sending
out
ocean
cruisers
but
on
the
lakes
it
was
subordinated
to
getting
the
control
of
the
lake
by
which
invaluable
assistance
could
be
rendered
to
the
army
the
most
thorough
way
of
accomplishing
this
of
course
was
by
destroying
the
enemy
squadron
but
it
could
also
be
done
by
building
ships
too
powerful
for
him
to
face
or
by
beating
him
in
some
engagement
which
although
not
destroying
his
fleet
would
force
him
to
go
into
port
if
one
side
was
stronger
then
the
weaker
party
by
skillful
manoeuvring
might
baffle
the
foe
and
rest
satisfied
by
keeping
the
sovereignty
of
the
lake
disputed
for
as
long
as
one
squadron
was
not
undisputed
master
it
could
not
be
of
much
assistance

transporting
troops

forts
or
otherwise

was
by

reduced
to
a

equality
with

a

this
estimate
as
to

much
as

has

in

the
complements

the
point

not
important

each
side
certainly
had
plenty
of
men
on
this
occasion

less

it
is
an
open
question
whether
the
enemy
needed
drawing
down

advanced
boldly
enough
the
formation
may
have
been
ingenious
but
it
was
the
reverse

it
would
have
been
far
better
to
have
had
the

they
would

moreover
it
does
not
speak
well
for
the
discipline
of
the
fleet
that
two
commanders
should
have
directly
disobeyed
orders
and
when
the
two
schooners
did
tack
and
it
was
evident
that
sir
james
would
cut
them
off
it
was
an
extraordinary
proceeding
for
chauncy
to
edge
away
two
points
to

the

it
is
certainly
a
novel
principle
that
if

it
is
to
run
away

rather
ridiculous
to
compare
these
lake
actions
fought
between
small
flotillas
with
the
gigantic
contests
which
the
huge
fleets
of
europe
waged
in
contending
for
the
supremacy
of
the
ocean
but
the
difference
is
one
of
degree
and
not
of
kind
and
they
serve
well
enough
for
purposes
of
illustration
or
comparison
the
two
fleets
engaged
in
a
fog
and
the
english
captured
two
ships
when
both
sides
drew
off
and
remained
in
sight
of
each
other
the
next
day
without
either
renewing
the
action
a
victory
therefore
it
was
that
sir
robert
calder
had
gained
but
not
a
nor
a
victory

a

as
to
whether

part
of
the
truth
in

as
he
did
i
was
much
disappointed
at
sir

refusing
to

me
as
he
was
so
much
superior
in

both
in

upward
of
guns
more
than
we
have

heaves
a
greater
weight
of

his
inferiority
in
the
long
guns
placed
yeo
at
a
great
disadvantage
in
such
a
very
light
wind
but
in
his
letter
he
makes
a
marvellous
admission
of
how
little
able
he
was
to
make
good
use
of
even
what
he
had
he
says
i
found
it
impossible
to
bring
them
to

we
remained
in
this
mortifying
situation
five

having
only
six

and
in
a
fight
of
five
hours
at
very
long
range
in
smooth
water
it
was
a
proof
of
culpable
incompetency
on
his
part
that
he
did
not
think
of
doing
what
elliott
and
perry
did
in
similar
circumstances
on

substitute
all
his
long

some

he
could

the
odds
were
thus
more
than
two

against
the
british
in
any

their
commander
lack
of
resource
made
them
still
greater

sir

yeo
in
the
had
his

shot
away
and
was
obliged
to
put
before
the
wind
gave
mulcaster
an
opportunity
of
displaying
a
trait
of
valor
and
seamanship
which
elicited
the
admiration
of
friends
and
foes
when
he
gallantly
placed
himself
between
his
disabled
commodore
and
a
superior
enemy
james
speaks
in
the
vaguest
terms
he
first
says
commodore
chauncy
having
the
kept
his
favorite
distance
which
he
did
because
commodore
yeo
fled
so
fast
that
he
could
not
be
overtaken
then
james
mentions
the
injuries
the
received
and
says
that
it
was
these
and
not
as
clark
says
manoeuvre
of
the
commodore
that
threw
the
british
in
confusion
in
other
words
it
was
the
commodore
shot
and
not
his
manoeuvring
that
threw
the
british
into
confusion
a
very
futile
distinction
next
he
says
that
commodore
chauncy
would
not
venture
within
carronade
range
whereas
he
within
carronade
range
of
the
and
but
the
latter
did
not
wait
for
the
and
to
get
within
range
with
carronades
the
rest
of
his
article
is
taken
up
with
exposing
the
absurdities
of
some
of
the
american
writings
miscalled
histories
which
appeared
at
the
close
of
the
war
his
criticisms
on
these
are
very
just
but
afford
a
funny
instance
of
the
pot
calling
the
kettle
black
this
much
is
clear
that
the
british
were
beaten
and
forced
to
flee
when
but
part
of
the
american
force
was
engaged
but
in
good
weather
the
american
force
was
so
superior
that
being
beaten
would
have
been
no
disgrace
to
yeo
had
it
not
been
for
the
claims
advanced
both
by
himself
and
his
friends
that
on
the
whole
he
was
victorious
over
chauncy
the
made
any
thing
but
an
obstinate
fight
leaving
almost
all
the
work
to
the
gallant
mulcaster
in
the
who
shares
with
lieutenant
finch
of
the
most
of
the
glory
of
the
day
the
battle
if
such
it
may
be
called
completely
established
chauncy
supremacy
yeo
spending
most
of
the
remainder
of
the
season
blockaded
in
kingston
so
chauncy
gained
a
victory
which
established
his
control
over
the
lakes
and
moreover
he
gained
it
by
fighting
in
succession
almost
the
two
heaviest
ships
of
the
enemy
but
gaining
the
victory
was
only
what
should
have
been
expected
from
a
superior
force
the
question
is
did
chauncy
use
his
force
to
the
best
advantage
and
it
can
not
be
said
that
he
did
when
the
enemy
bore
up
it
was
a
great
mistake
not
to
cast
off
the
schooners
which
were
being
towed
they
were
small
craft
not
of
much
use
in
the
fight
and
they
entirely
prevented
the
from
taking
any
part
in
the
contest
and
kept
the
at
a
great
distance
and
by
keeping
the
in
tow
the
which
sailed
faster
than
any
of
yeo
ships
was
distanced
by
them
had
she
left
the
behind
and
run
in
to
engage
the
she
could
have
mastered
or
at
any
rate
disabled
her
and
had
the
swift
cast
off
her
tow
she
could
also
have
taken
an
effective
part
in
the
engagement
if
the
could
put
the
british
to
flight
almost
how
much
more
could
she
not
have
done
when
assisted
by
the
and
the
cardinal
error
however
was
made
in
discontinuing
the
chase
the
british
were
in
an
almost
open
roadstead
from
which
they
could
not
possibly
escape
commodore
chauncy
was
afraid
that
the
wind
would
come
up
to
blow
a
gale
and
both
fleets
would
be
thrown
ashore
and
moreover
he
expected
to
be
able
to
keep
a
watch
over
the
enemy
and
to
attack
him
at
a
more
suitable
time
but
he
utterly
failed
in
this
last
and
had
the
american
squadron
cast
off
their
tows
and
gone
boldly
in
they
certainly
ought
to
have
been
able
to
destroy
or
capture
the
entire
british
force
before
a
gale
could
blow
up
chauncy
would
have
done
well
to
keep
in
mind
the
old
adage
so
peculiarly
applicable
to
naval
affairs
toujours
et
encore
whether
the
fault
was
his
or
that
of
his
subordinates
it
is
certain
that
while
the
victory
of
the
of
september
definitely
settled
the
supremacy
of
the
lake
in
favor
of
the
americans
yet
this
victory
was
by
no
means
so
decided
as
it
should
have
been
taking
into
account
his
superiority
in
force
and
advantage
in
position
and
the
somewhat
spiritless
conduct
of
his
foe
next
day
a
gale
came
on
to
blow
which
lasted
till
the
evening

the
there
was
no

themselves

to

escaped
by
his
better

and
next
day
false
information
induced
chauncy
to

had
eluded
him
and
passed
down
the
lake
and

accordingly
made
sail
in
the
direction
of

supposed
flight

closed

between
the

the
success
of
the
season
was
greatly
in
favor
of
the
former

had
uncontested
control
over

from
april
to

from
to

sides
were
contending
for

york
and
fort
george
had
been
taken
while
the
attack
on
sackett
harbor
was
repulsed
the
americans
lost
but
two
schooners
both
of
which
were
recaptured

the
british
had
one
nearly
ready
for
launching
destroyed
and
one
brig
taken
and
the
loss
inflicted
upon
each
other
in

in

army
for
over
twice
the
length
of

to
it
is
more
difficult
to
decide
between
the
respective
merits
of
the
two
commanders
we
had
shown
so
much
more
energy
than
the
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
we
had
overtaken
them
in
the
building
race
and
the
two
fleets
were
about
equally
formidable
the
and
were
not
quite
a
match
for
the
and
opposing
and
carronades
to
long
long
and
carronades
and
our
ten
would
hardly
be
considered
very
much
of
an
overmatch
for
the
and
had
sir
james
yeo
been
as
bold
and
energetic
as
barclay
or
mulcaster
he
would
certainly
not
have
permitted
the
americans
when
the
forces
were
so
equal
to
hold
uncontested
sway
over
the
lake
and
by
reducing
fort
george
to
cause
disaster
to
the
british
land
forces
it
would
certainly
have
been
better
to
risk
a
battle
with
equal
forces
than
to
wait
till
each
fleet
received
an
additional
ship
which
rendered
chauncy
squadron
the
superior

just
about
the
superiority
of
the

not
do
particularly
well
in
the
repulse
before
harbor
in
the
skirmish
off
genesee
river
he
showed
a
marked
lack
of
resource
and
in
the
action
of
the
of
september
popularly
called
the
burlington
races
from
the
celerity
of
his
retreat
he
evinced
an
amount
of
caution
that
verged
toward
timidity
in
allowing
the
entire
brunt
of
the
fighting
to
fall
on
mulcaster
in
the
a
weaker
ship
than
the
on
the
other
hand
he
gave
able
to
the
army
while
he
possessed
control
of
the
lake
he
made
a
most
gallant
and
successful
attack
on
a
superior
force
on
the
of
august
and
for
six
weeks
subsequently
by
skilful
manoeuvring
he
prevented
this
same
superior
force
from
acquiring
the
uncontested
mastery
it
was
no
disgrace
to
be
subsequently
blockaded
but
it
is
very
ludicrous
in
his
admirers
to
think
that
he
came
out
first
best
chauncy
rendered
able
and
invaluable
assistance
to
the
army
all
the
while
that
he
had
control
of
the
water
his
attacks
on
york
and
fort
george
were
managed
with
consummate
skill
and
success
and
on
the
of
september
he
practically
defeated
the
opposing
force
with
his
own
ship
alone
nevertheless
he
can
by
no
means
be
said
to
have
done
the
best
he
could
with
the
materials
he
had
his
stronger
fleet
was
kept
two
months
in
check
by
a
weaker
british
fleet
when
he
first
encountered
the
foe
on
august
he
ought
to
have
inflicted
such
a
check
upon
him
as
would
at
least
have
confined
him
to
port
and
given
the
americans
immediate
superiority
on
the
lake
instead
of
which
he
suffered
a
mortifying
although
not
at
all
disastrous
defeat
which
allowed
the
british
to
contest
the
supremacy
with
him
for
six
weeks
longer
on
the
of
september
when
he
only
gained
a
rather
barren
victory
it
was
nothing
but
excessive
caution
that
prevented
him
from
utterly
destroying
his
foe
had
perry
on
that
day
commanded
the
american
fleet
there
would
have
been
hardly
a
british
ship
left
on
ontario
chauncy
was
an
average
commander
and
the
balance
of
success
inclined
to
the
side
of
the
americans
only
because
they
showed
greater
energy
and
skill
in
shipbuilding
the
crews
and
commanders
on
both
sides
being
very
nearly
equal
lake
erie
captain
oliver
hazard
perry
had
assumed
command
of
erie
and
the
upper
lakes
acting
under
commodore
chauncy
with
intense
energy
he
at
once
began
creating
a
naval
force
which
should
be
able
to
contend
successfully
with
the
foe
as
already
said
the
latter
in
the
beginning
had
exclusive
control
of
lake
erie
but
the
americans
had
captured
the
brig
and
purchased
three
schooners
afterward
named
the
and
and
a
sloop
the
these
at
first
were
blockaded
in
the
niagara
but
after
the
fall
of
fort
george
and
retreat
of
the
british
forces
captain
perry
was
enabled
to
get
them
out
tracking
them
up
against
the
current
by
the
most
arduous
labor
they
ran
up
to
presque
isle
now
called
erie
where
two
brigs
were
being
constructed
under
the
directions
of
the
indefatigable
captain
three
other
schooners
the
and
were
also
built
the
harbor
of
erie
was
good
and
spacious
but
had
a
bar
on
which
there
was
less
than
seven
feet
of
water
hitherto
this
had
prevented
the
enemy
from
getting
in
now
it
prevented
the
two
brigs
from
getting
out
captain
robert
heriot
barclay
had
been
appointed
commander
of
the
british
forces
on
lake
erie
and
he
was
having
built
at
amherstburg
a
ship
meanwhile
he
blockaded
force
and
as
the
brigs
could
not
cross
the
bar
with
their
guns
in
or
except
in
smooth
water
they
of
course
could
not
do
so
in
his
presence
he
kept
a
close
blockade
for
some
time
but
on
the
of
august
he
disappeared
perry
at
once
hurried
forward
every
thing
and
on
the
at
one
brig
the
was
towed
to
that
point
of
the
bar
where
the
water
was
deepest
her
guns
were
whipped
out
and
landed
on
the
beach
and
the
brig
got
over
the
bar
by
a
hastily
improvised
camel
two
large
scows
prepared
for
the
purpose
were
hauled
alongside
and
the
work
of
lifting
the
brig
proceeded
as
fast
as
possible
pieces
of
massive
timber
had
been
run
through
the
forward
and
after
ports
and
when
the
scows
were
sunk
to
the
water
edge
the
ends
of
the
timbers
were
blocked
up
supported
by
these
floating
foundations
the
plugs
were
now
put
in
the
scows
and
the
water
was
pumped
out
of
them
by
this
process
the
brig
was
lifted
quite
two
feet
though
when
she
was
got
on
the
bar
it
was
found
that
she
still
drew
too
much
water
it
became
necessary
in
consequence
to
cover
up
every
thing
sink
the
scows
anew
and
block
up
the
timbers
afresh
this
duty
occupied
the
whole
night
footnote
cooper

letter
of
is
very
brief
just
as
the
had
passed
the
bar
at
on
the
the
enemy
reappeared
but
too
late
captain
barclay
exchanged
a
few
shots
with
the
schooners
and
then
drew
off
the
crossed
without
difficulty
there
were
still
not
enough
men
to
man
the
vessels
but
a
draft
arrived
from
ontario
and
many
of
the
frontiersmen
volunteered
while
soldiers
also
were
sent
on
board
the
squadron
sailed
on
the
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
whose
ship
was
now
ready
after
cruising
about
some
time
the
was
sent
down
the
lake
and
the
other
ships
went
into
bay
on
the
of
september
captain
barclay
put
out
from
amherstburg
being
so
short
of
provisions
that
he
felt
compelled
to
risk
an
action
with
the
superior
force
opposed
on
the
of
september
his
squadron
was
discovered
from
the
of
the
in
the
northwest
before
going
into
details
of
the
action
we
will
examine
the
force
of
the
two
squadrons
as
the
accounts
vary
considerably
the
tonnage
of
the
british
ships
as
already
stated
we
know
exactly
they
having
been
all
carefully
appraised
and
measured
by
the
builder
henry
eckford
and
two
we
also
know
the
dimensions
of
the
american
ships
the
and
measured
tons
apiece
the
brig
was
about
the
size
of
the
or
tons
the
and
were
subsequently
captured
by
the
foe
and
were
then
said
to
measure
respectively
and
tons
in
which
case
they
were
larger
than
similar
boats
on
lake
ontario
the
was
about
the
size
of
the
the
and
about
the
size
of
the
and
as
for
the
guns
captain
barclay
in
his
letter
gives
a
complete
account
of
those
on
board
his
squadron
he
has
also
given
a
complete
account
of
the
american
guns
which
is
most
accurate
and
if
any
thing
underestimates
them
at
least
emmons
in
his
history
gives
the
a
long
while
barclay
says
she
had
only
a
long
and
lossing
in
his
says
but
i
do
not
know
on
what
authority
that
the
had
long
while
barclay
gives
her
long
and
one
carronade
and
that
the
had
two
long
while
barclay
gives
her
one
long
and
one
carronade
i
shall
take
barclay
account
which
corresponds
with
that
of
emmons
the
only
difference
being
that
emmons
puts
a
on
the
and
a
on
the
while
barclay
reverses
this
i
shall
also
follow
emmons
in
giving
the
a
carronade
instead
of
a
it
is
more
difficult
to
give
the
strength
of
the
respective
crews
james
says
the
americans
had
all
picked
men
they
were
just
as
much
picked
men
as
barclay
were
and
no
more
that
is
the
ships
had
scratch
crews
lieutenant
emmons
gives
perry
men
and
lossing
says
he
had
upon
his
names
in
vol
xiv
of
the
american
state
papers
is
a
list
of
the
owing
to
each
man
or
to
the
survivors
of
the
killed
which
gives
a
grand
total
of
men
including
on
the
and
on
the
of
whom
were
volunteers
frontiersmen
deducting
these
we
get
men
which
is
pretty
near
lieutenant
emmons
possibly
lieutenant
emmons
did
not
include
these
volunteers
and
it
may
be
that
some
of
the
men
whose
names
were
down
on
the
prize
list
had
been
so
sick
that
they
were
left
on
shore
thus
lieutenant
yarnall
testified
before
a
court
of
inquiry
in
that
there
were
but
men
and
boys
of
every
description
on
board
the
in
the
action
and
the
was
said
to
have
had
but
lieutenant
yarnall
also
said
that
but
men
on
board
the
were
fit
for
duty
as
captain
perry
in
his
letter
said
that
were
unfit
for
duty
this
would
make
a
total
of
so
i
shall
follow
the
list
at
any
rate
the
difference
in
number
is
so
slight
as
to
be
immaterial
of
the
men
whose
names
the
list
gives
were
volunteers
or
landsmen
from
among
the
surrounding
inhabitants
were
marines
or
soldiers
i
do
not
know
which
as
the
list
gives
marines
soldiers
and
privates
and
it
is
impossible
to
tell
which
of
the
two
former
heads
include
the
last
and
were
officers
seamen
cooks
pursers
chaplains
and
supernumeraries
of
the
total
number
there
were
on
the
day
of
action
according
to
perry
report
men
unfit
for
duty
including
on
board
the
on
board
the
and
on
the
small
vessels
all
the
later
american
writers
put
the
number
of
men
in
fleet
precisely
at
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
out
the
original
authority
james
naval
occurrences
says
the
british
had
but
consisting
of
seamen
canadians
and
soldiers
but
the
letter
of
bayne
states
that
there
were
soldiers
aboard
barclay
squadron
of
whom
were
killed
wounded
and
the
balance
captured
and
james
himself
on
a
previous
page
states
that
there
were
canadians
on
barclay
vessels
not
counting
the
and
we
know
that
barclay
originally
joined
the
squadron
with
sailors
from
the
ontario
fleet
and
that
subsequently
sailors
came
up
from
the
james
gives
at
the
end
of
his
naval
occurrences
some
extracts
from
the
held
on
captain
barclay
lieut
thomas
stokes
of
the
there
testified
that
he
had
on
board
between
and
men
officers
and
all
together
of
whom
came
up
from
the
three
days
before
james
on
says
her
crew
already
consisted
of
men
adding
these
gives
us
almost
exactly
between
and
lieutenant
stokes
also
testified
that
the
had
more
men
on
account
of
being
a
larger
and
heavier
vessel
to
give
her
is
perfectly
safe
as
her
heavier
guns
and
larger
size
would
at
least
need
men
more
than
the
james
gives
the
and
men
canadians
and
soldiers
a
total
of
supposing
that
the
number
of
british
sailors
placed
on
them
was
proportional
to
the
amount
placed
on
board
the
we
could
add
this
would
make
a
grand
total
of
men
which
must
certainly
be
near
the
truth
this
number
is
corroborated
otherwise
general
bayne
as
already
quoted
says
that
there
were
aboard
soldiers
of
whom
were
killed
or
wounded
barclay
reports
a
total
loss
of
of
whom
must
therefore
have
been
sailors
or
canadians
and
if
the
loss
suffered
by
these
bore
the
same
proportion
to
their
whole
number
as
in
the
case
of
the
soldiers
there
ought
to
have
been
sailors
and
canadians
making
in
all
men
it
can
thus
be
said
with
certainty
that
there
were
between
and
men
aboard
and
i
shall
take
the
former
number
though
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
is
too
small
but
it
is
not
a
point
of
very
much
importance
as
the
battle
was
fought
largely
at
long
range
where
the
number
of
men
provided
there
were
plenty
to
handle
the
sails
and
guns
did
not
much
matter
the
following
statement
of
the
comparative
force
must
therefore
be
very
nearly
accurate

these
six
vessels
thus
threw
at
a
broadside
of
which
were
from
long
guns
the
superiority
of
the
americans
in
metal
was
therefore
nearly
as
three
is
to
two
and
in
carronade
metal
greater
than
two
to
one
the
chief
fault
to
be
found
in
the
various
american
accounts
is
that
they
sedulously
conceal
the
comparative
weight
of
metal
while
carefully
specifying
the
number
of
guns
thus
lossing
says
barclay
had
long
guns
to
perry
and
possessed
greatly
the
advantage
in
action
at
a
distance
which
he
certainly
did
not
the
tonnage
of
the
fleets
is
not
so
very
important
the
above
tables
are
probably
pretty
nearly
right
it
is
i
suppose
impossible
to
tell
exactly
the
number
of
men
in
the
two
crews
barclay
almost
certainly
had
more
than
the
men
i
have
given
him
but
in
all
likelihood
some
of
them
were
unfit
for
duty
and
the
number
of
his
effectives
was
most
probably
somewhat
less
than
perry
as
the
battle
was
fought
in
such
smooth
water
and
part
of
the
time
at
long
range
this
as
already
said
does
not
much
matter
the
niagara
might
be
considered
a
match
for
the
detroit
and
the
lawrence
and
caledonia
for
the
five
other
british
vessels

the
americans
were
certainly
very
greatly

it
was
twenty
minutes
before

succeeded
in
getting
within
good
carronade
range
and
during
that
time
the
action
at
the
head
of

was
between
the
long
guns
of

those

which
prevented
the
use
either
of

carronades
or
of
those
of
the
his
antagonist
the
latter
however
suffered
greatly
from
the
long
guns
of
the
opposing
schooners
and
lost
her
gallant
commander
captain
finnis
and

quarters
the
the
most
efficient
and
of
the
american
vessels
was
thus
almost
kept
out
of
the
action
by
her
captain
misconduct
at
the
end
of
the
line
the
fight
went
on
at
long
range
between
the
and
on
one
side
and
and
on
the
other
the
making
a
very
noble
fight
although
her
carronades
rendered
her
almost
helpless
against
the
long
guns
of
the
americans
she
was
greatly
cut
up
her
commander
lieutenant
buchan
was
dangerously
and
her
acting
first
lieutenant
roulette
severely
wounded
and
she
began
falling
gradually
to
leeward
the
fighting
at
the
head
of
the
line
was
fierce
and
bloody
to
an
extraordinary
degree
the
and
all
of
them
handled
with
the
most
determined
courage
were
opposed
to
the
and
which
were
fought
to
the
full
as
bravely
at
such
close
quarters
the
two
sides
engaged
on
about
equal
terms
the
americans
being
superior
in
weight
of
metal
and
inferior
in
number
of
men
but
the
had
received
such
damage
in
working
down
as
to
make
the
odds
against
perry
on
each
side
almost
the
whole
fire
was
directed
at
the
opposing
large
vessel
or
vessels
in
consequence
the
was
almost
disabled
and
the
was
also
frightfully
shattered
especially
by
the
raking
fire
of
the
her
first
lieutenant
garland
being
mortally
wounded
and
captain
barclay
so
severely
injured
that
he
was
obliged
to
quit
the
deck
leaving
his
ship
in
the
command
of
lieutenant
george
inglis
but
on
board
the
matters
had
gone
even
worse
the
combined
fire
of
her
adversaries
having
made
the
grimmest
carnage
on
her
decks
of
the
men
who
were
fit
for
duty
when
she
began
the
action
or
over
four
fifths
were
killed
or
wounded
the
vessel
was
shallow
and
the
used
as
a
cockpit
to
which
the
wounded
were
taken
was
mostly
above
water
and
the
shot
came
through
it
continually
killing
and
wounding
many
men
under
the
hands
of
the
surgeon
the
first
lieutenant
yarnall
was
three
times
wounded
but
kept
to
the
deck
through
all
the
only
other
lieutenant
on
board
brooks
of
the
marines
was
mortally
wounded
every
brace
and
bowline
was
shot
away
and
the
brig
almost
completely
dismantled
her
hull
was
shattered
to
pieces
many
shot
going
completely
through
it
and
the
guns
on
the
engaged
side
were
by
degrees
all
dismounted
perry
kept
up
the
fight
with
splendid
courage
as
the
crew
fell
one
by
one
the
commodore
called
down
through
the
skylight
for
one
of
the
surgeon
assistants
and
this
call
was
repeated
and
obeyed
till
none
were
left
then
he
asked
can
any
of
the
wounded
pull
a
rope
and
three
or
four
of
them
crawled
up
on
deck
to
lend
a
feeble
hand
in
placing
the
last
guns
perry
himself
fired
the
last
effective
heavy
gun
assisted
only
by
the
purser
and
chaplain
a
man
who
did
not
possess
his
indomitable
spirit
would
have
then
struck
instead
however
although
failing
in
the
attack
so
far
perry
merely
determined
to
win
by
new
methods
and
remodelled
the
line
accordingly
turner
in
the
when
ordered
to
close
had
put
his
helm
up
run
down
on
the
opposing
line
and
engaged
at
very
short
range
though
the
brig
was
absolutely
without
quarters

thus
become

was
almost
uninjured

so
far
taken
very
little

shifted
his
flag

into
a
row

with
his
brother
and
four
seamen

rowed

there

british

raked
by

closely

illustration
the
victory
of
lake
erie
was
most
important
both
in
its
material
results
and
in
its
moral
effect
it
gave
us
complete
command
of
all
the
upper
lakes
prevented
any
fears
of
invasion
from
that
quarter
increased
our
prestige
with
the
foe
and
our
confidence
in
ourselves
and
ensured
the
conquest
of
upper
canada
in
all
these
respects
its
importance
has
not
been
overrated
but
the
glory
acquired
by
it
most
certainly
been
estimated
at
more
than
its
worth
most
americans
even
the
well
educated
if
asked
which
was
the
most
glorious
victory
of
the
war
would
point
to
this
battle
captain
perry
name
is
more
widely
known
than
that
of
any
other
commander
every
reads
about
if
of
no
other
yet
he
certainly
stands
on
a
lower
grade
than
either
hull
or
macdonough
and
not
a
bit
higher
than
a
dozen
others
on
lake
erie
our
seamen
displayed
great
courage
and
skill
but
so
did
their
antagonists
the
simple
truth
is
that
where
on
both
sides
the
officers
and
men
were
equally
brave
and
skilful
the
side
which
possessed
the
superiority
in
force
in
the
proportion
of
three
to
two
could
not
well
help
winning
the
courage
with
which
the
was
defended
has
hardly
ever
been
surpassed
and
may
fairly
be
called
heroic
but
equal
praise
belongs
to
the
men
on
board
the
who
had
to
discharge
the
great
guns
by
flashing
pistols
at
the
touchholes
and
yet
made
such
a
terribly
effective
defence
courage
is
only
one
of
the
many
elements
which
go
to
make
up
the
character
of
a
commander
something
more
than
bravery
is
needed
before
a
leader
can
be
really
called
great
there
happened
to
be
circumstances
which
rendered
the
bragging
of
our
writers
over
the
victory
somewhat
plausible
thus
they
could
say
with
an
appearance
of
truth
that
the
enemy
had
guns
to
our
and
outnumbered
us
in
reality
as
well
as
can
be
ascertained
from
the
conflicting
evidence
he
was
inferior
in
number
but
a
few
men
more
or
less
mattered
nothing
both
sides
had
men
enough
to
work
the
guns
and
handle
the
ships
especially
as
the
fight
was
in
smooth
water
and
largely
at
long
range
the
important
fact
was
that
though
we
had
nine
guns
less
yet
at
a
broadside
they
threw
half
as
much
metal
again
as
those
of
our
antagonist
with
such
odds
in
our
favor
it
would
have
been
a
disgrace
to
have
been
beaten
the
water
was
too
smooth
for
our
two
brigs
to
show
at
their
best
but
this
very
smoothness
rendered
our
more
formidable
than
any
of
the
british
vessels
and
the
british
testimony
is
unanimous
that
it
was
to
them
the
defeat
was
primarily
due
the
american
fleet
came
into
action
in
worse
form
than
the
hostile
squadron
the
ships
straggling
badly
either
owing
to
perry
having
formed
his
line
badly
or
else
to
his
having
failed
to
train
the
subordinate
commanders
how
to
keep
their
places
the
niagara
was
not
fought
well
at
first
captain
elliott
keeping
her
at
a
distance
that
prevented
her
from
doing
any
damage
to
the
vessels
opposed
which
were
battered
to
pieces
by
the
without
the
chance
of
replying
it
certainly
seems
as
if
the
small
vessels
at
the
rear
of
the
line
should
have
been
closer
up
and
in
a
position
to
render
more
effectual
assistance
the
attack
was
made
in
too
loose
order
and
whether
it
was
the
fault
of
perry
or
of
his
subordinates
it
fails
to
reflect
credit
on
the
americans
cooper
as
usual
praises
all
concerned
but
in
this
instance
not
with
very
good
judgment
he
says
the
was
highly
judicious
but
this
may
be
doubted
the
weather
was
peculiarly
suitable
for
the
with
their
long
heavy
guns
and
yet
the
was
so
arranged
as
to
keep
them
in
the
rear
and
let
the
brunt
of
the
assault
fall
on
the
with
her
short
carronades
cooper
again
praises
perry
for
steering
for
the
head
of
the
enemy
line
but
he
could
hardly
have
done
any
thing
else
in
this
battle
the
firing
seems
to
have
been
equally
skilful
on
both
sides
the
long
guns
being
peculiarly
well
served
but
the
british
captains
manoeuvred
better
than
their
foes
at
first
and
supported
one
another
better
so
that
the
disparity
in
damage
done
on
each
side
was
not
equal
to
the
disparity
in
force
the
chief
merit
of
the
american
commander
and
his
followers
was
indomitable
courage
and
determination
not
to
be
beaten
this
is
no
slight
merit
but
it
may
well
be
doubted
if
it
would
have
ensured
victory
had
barclay
force
been
as
strong
as
perry
perry
made
a
headlong
attack
his
superior
force
whether
through
his
fault
or
his
misfortune
can
hardly
be
said
being
brought
into
action
in
such
a
manner
that
the
head
of
the
line
was
crushed
by
the
inferior
force
opposed
being
literally
hammered
out
of
his
own
ship
perry
brought
up
its
powerful
and
the
already
shattered
hostile
squadron
was
crushed
by
sheer
weight
the
manoeuvres
which
marked
the
close
of
the
battle
and
which
ensured
the
capture
of
all
the
opposing
ships
were
unquestionably
very
fine
the
british
ships
were
fought
as
resolutely
as
their
antagonists
not
being
surrendered
till
they
were
crippled
and
helpless
and
almost
all
the
officers
and
a
large
proportion
of
the
men
placed
de
captain
barclay
handled
his
ships
like
a
seaman
it
was
impossible
to
arrange
them
so
as
to
be
superior
to
his
antagonist
for
the
latter
force
was
of
such
a
nature
that
in
smooth
water
his
gave
him
a
great
advantage
while
in
any
sea
his
two
brigs
were
more
than
a
match
for
the
whole
british
squadron
in
short
our
victory
was
due
to
our
heavy
metal
as
regards
the
honor
of
the
affair
in
spite
of
the
amount
of
boasting
it
has
given
rise
to
i
should
say
it
was
a
battle
to
be
looked
upon
as
in
an
equally
high
degree
creditable
to
both
sides
indeed
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
the
victory
was
so
complete
it
might
be
said
that
the
length
of
the
contest
and
the
trifling
disparity
in
loss
reflected
rather
the
most
credit
on
the
british
captain
perry
showed
indomitable
pluck
and
readiness
to
adapt
himself
to
circumstances
but
his
claim
to
fame
rests
much
less
on
his
actual
victory
than
on
the
way
in
which
he
prepared
the
fleet
that
was
to
win
it
here
his
energy
and
activity
deserve
all
praise
not
only
for
his
success
in
collecting
sailors
and
vessels
and
in
building
the
two
brigs
but
above
all
for
the
manner
in
which
he
succeeded
in
getting
them
out
on
the
lake
on
occasion
he
certainly
barclay
indeed
the
latter
committed
an
error
that
the
skill
and
address
he
subsequently
showed
could
not
retrieve
but
it
will
always
be
a
source
of
surprise
that
the
american
public
should
have
so
glorified
perry
victory
over
an
inferior
force
and
have
paid
comparatively
little
attention
to
macdonough
victory
which
really
was
won
against
decided
odds
in
ships
men
and
metal
there
are
always
men
who
consider
it
unpatriotic
to
tell
the
truth
if
the
truth
is
not
very
flattering
but
aside
from
the
morality
of
the
case
we
never
can
learn
how
to

past
lake
erie
teaches
us
the
advantage
of
having
the
odds
on
our
side
lake
champlain
that
even
if
they
are
not
skill
can
still
counteract
them
it
is
amusing
to
read
some
of
the
pamphlets
written
in
reply
to
cooper
account
of
this
battle
the
writers
apparently
regarding
him
as
a
kind
of
traitor
for
hinting
that
the
victory
was
not
nelsonic
unsurpassed
etc
the
arguments
are
stereotyped
perry
had
fewer
guns
and
also
fewer
men
than
the
foe
this
last
point
is
the
only
one
respecting
which
there
is
any
doubt
taking
sick
and
well
together
the
americans
unquestionably
had
the
greatest
number
in
crew
but
a
quarter
of
them
were
sick
even
deducting
these
they
were
still
in
all
probability
more
numerous
than
their
foes
but
it
is
really
not
a
point
of
much
consequence
as
both
sides
had
enough
as
stated
to
serve
the
guns
and
handle
the
ships
in
after
there
are
enough
hands
for
those
purposes
additional
ones
are
not
of
so
much
advantage
i
have
in
all
my
accounts
summed
up
as
accurately
as
possible
the
contending
forces
because
it
is
so
customary
with
british
writers
to
follow
james
minute
and
inaccurate
statements
that
i
thought
it
best
to
give
every
thing
exactly
but
it
was
really
scarcely
necessary
and
indeed
it
is
impossible
to
compare
forces
numerically
aside
from
a
few
exceptional
cases
the
number
of
men
after
a
certain
point
was
reached
made
little
difference
for
example
the
would
fight
just
as
effectually
with
men
the
number
james
gives
her
as
with
the
number
i
think
she
really
had
again
my
figures
make
the
slightly
superior
in
force
to
the
as
she
had
men
the
most
but
in
reality
as
the
battle
was
fought
under
very
short
sail
and
decided
purely
by
gunnery
the
difference
in
number
of
crew
was
not
of
the
least
consequence
the
hornet
had
nine
men
more
than
the
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
this
gave
her
much
advantage
in
both
the
latter
cases
the
forces
were
practically
equal
although
numerically
expressed
the
odds
were
in
favor
of
the
americans
the
exact
reverse
is
the
case
in
the
last
action
of
the
here
the
and
had
all
the
men
they
required
and
threw
a
heavier
broadside
than
their
foe
expressed
in
numbers
the
odds
against
them
were
not
great
but
numbers
could
not
express
the
fact
that
carronades
were
opposed
to
long
guns
and
two
small
ships
to
one
big
one
again
though
in
the
action
on
lake
champlain
numbers
do
show
a
slight
advantage
both
in
weight
of
metal
and
number
of
men
on
the
british
side
they
do
not
make
the
advantage
as
great
as
it
really
was
for
they
do
not
show
that
the
british
possessed
a
frigate
with
a
battery
of
which
was
equal
to
the
two
chief
vessels
of
the
americans
exactly
as
the
was
superior
to
the
and
footnote
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
these
rules
cut
both
ways
british
writers
are
very
eloquent
about
the
disadvantage
in
which
carronades
placed
the
and
but
do
not
hint
that
the
suffered
from
a
precisely
similar
cause
in
addition
to
her
other
misfortunes
either
they
should
give
the
more
credit
or
the
less
so
the
throwing
pounds
of
metal
at
a
broadside
was
really
equal
to
both
the
and
who
jointly
threw
from
her
long
guns
she
threw
pounds
from
her
carronades
their
long
guns
threw
their
carronades
now
the
carronade
mounted
on
the
of
a
frigate
was
certainly
much
less
formidable
than
the
long
on
the
indeed
it
probably
ranked
more
nearly
with
a
long
in
the
ordinary
chances
of
war
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
downie
was
the
attacking
party
and
chose
his
own
position
so
far
as
macdonough
excellent
arrangements
would
let
him
so
that
in
comparing
the
forces
the
carronades
should
not
be
reckoned
for
more
than
half
the
value
of
the
long
guns
and
we
get
as
a
mere
approximation
against
at
any
rate
british
writers
as
well
as
americans
should
remember
that
if
the
was
greatly
superior
to
her
two
foes
then
the
was
certainly
equal
to
the
and
and
and
on
the
same
principles
i
think
that
every
man
must
admit
the
great
superiority
of
fleet
over
barclay
though
the
advantage
was
greater
in
carronades
than
in
long
guns
but
to
admit
this
by
no
means
precludes
us
from
taking
credit
for
the
victory
almost
all
the
victories
gamed
by
the
english
over
the
dutch
in
the
century
were
due
purely
to
great
superiority
in
force
the
cases
have
a
curious
analogy
to
this
lake
battle
perry
won
with
guns
against
barclay
but
the
odds
were
largely
in
his
favor
blake
won
a
doubtful
victory
on
the
of
february
with
ships
against
tromp
but
the
english
vessels
were
twice
the
size
of
the
dutch
and
in
number
of
men
and
weight
of
metal
greatly
their
superior
the
english
were
excellent
fighters
but
no
better
than
the
dutch
and
none
of
their
admirals
of
that
period
deserve
to
rank
with
de
ruyter
again
the
great
victory
of
la
hogue
was
won
over
a
very
much
smaller
french
fleet
after
a
day
hard
fighting
which
resulted
in
the
capture
of
vessel
this
victory
was
most
exultingly
chronicled
yet
it
was
precisely
as
if
perry
had
fought
barclay
all
day
and
only
succeeded
in
capturing
the
most
of
lord
nelson
successes
were
certainly
won
against
heavy
odds
by
his
great
genius
and
the
daring
skill
of
the
captains
who
served
under
him
but
the
battle
of
the
baltic
as
far
as
the
fighting
went
reflected
as
much
honor
on
the
defeated
danes
as
on
the
mighty
who
conquered
them
many
a
victory
both
on
sea
and
land
has
really
reflected
less
credit
on
the
victors
than
the
battle
of
lake
erie
did
on
the
americans
and
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
a
victory
honorably
won
if
even
over
a
weaker
foe
reflect
credit
on
the
nation
by
whom
it
is
gained
it
was
creditable
to
us
as
a
nation
that
our
ships
were
better
made
and
better
armed
than
the
british
frigates
exactly
as
it
was
creditable
to
them
that
a
few
years
before
their
vessels
had
stood
in
the
same
relation
to
the
dutch
ships
footnote
after
lord
duncan
victory
at
camperdown
james
chronicled
the
fact
that
all
the
captured
ships
were
such
poor
craft
as
not
to
be
of
as
much
value
as
so
many
french
frigates
this
at
least
showed
that
the
dutch
sailors
must
have
done
well
to
have
made
such
a
bloody
and
obstinate
fight
as
they
did
with
the
materials
they
had
according
to
his
own
statements
the
loss
was
about
proportional
to
the
forces
in
action
it
was
another
parallel
to
perry
victory
it
was
greatly
to
our
credit
that
we
had
been
enterprising
enough
to
fit
out
such
an
effective
little
flotilla
on
lake
erie
and
for
this
perry
deserves
the
highest
praise
footnote
some
of
my
countrymen
will
consider
this
but
scant
approbation
to
which
the
answer
must
be
that
a
history
is
not
a
panegyric
before
leaving
the
subject
it
is
worth
while
making
a
few
observations
on
the
men
who
composed
the
crews
james
who
despised
a
canadian
as
much
as
he
hated
an
american
gives
as
one
excuse
for
the
defeat
the
fact
that
most
of
barclay
crew
were
canadians
whom
he
considers
to
be
sorry
substitutes
on
each
side
the
regular
sailors
from
the
seaboard
were
not
numerous
enough
to
permit
the
battle
to
be
fought
purely
by
them
barclay
took
a
number
of
soldiers
of
the
regular
army
and
perry
a
number
of
militia
aboard
the
former
had
a
few
indian
the
latter
quite
a
number
of
negroes
a
great
many
men
in
each
fleet
were
lake
sailors
frontiersmen
and
these
were
the
especial
objects
of
james
contempt
but
it
may
be
doubted
if
they
thoroughly
accustomed
to
lake
navigation
used
to
contests
with
indians
and
whites
naturally
forced
to
be
good
sailors
and
skilful
in
the
use
of
rifle
and
cannon
were
not
when
trained
by
good
men
and
on
their
own
waters
the
very
best
possible
material
certainly
the
battle
of
lake
erie
fought
mainly
by
canadians
was
better
contested
than
that
of
lake
champlain
fought
mainly
by
british
the
difference
between
the
american
and
british
seamen
on
the
atlantic
was
small
but
on
the
lakes
what
little
there
was
disappeared
a
new
englander
and
an
old
englander
differed
little
enough
but
they
differed
more
than
a
frontiersman
born
north
of
the
line
did
from
one
born
south
of
it
these
last
two
resembled
one
another
more
nearly
than
either
did
the
parent
there
had
been
no
naval
school
on
the
lakes
and
the
british
sailors
that
came
up
there
were
the
best
of
their
kind
so
the
combatants
were
really
so
evenly
matched
in
courage
skill
and
all
other
fighting
qualities
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
award
the
palm
to
either
for
these
attributes
the
dogged
obstinacy
of
the
fighting
the
skilful
firing
and
manoeuvring
and
the
daring
and
coolness
with
which
expeditions
were
planned
and
executed
were
as
marked
on
one
side
as
the
other
the
only
element
in
the
contest
was
the
presence
among
the
canadian
english
of
some
of
the
descendants
of
the
latin
race
from
whom
they
had
conquered
the
country
otherwise
the
men
were
equally
matched
but
the
americans
owed
their
success
for
the
balance
of
success
was
largely
on
their
side
to
the
fact
that
their
officers
had
been
trained
in
the
best
and
most
practical
although
the
smallest
navy
of
the
day
the
british
sailors
on
the
lakes
were
as
good
as
our
own
but
no
better
none
of
their
commanders
compare
with
macdonough
perry
deserves
all
praise
for
the
manner
in
which
he
got
his
fleet
ready
his
victory
over
barclay
was
precisely
similar
to
the
of
blake
over
the
dutch
which
have
given
that
admiral
such
renown
blake
success
in
attacking
spanish
and
algerian
forts
is
his
true
title
to
fame
in
his
engagements
with
the
dutch
fleets
as
well
as
in
those
of
monk
after
him
his
claim
to
merit
is
no
greater
and
no
less
than
perry
each
made
a
headlong
attack
with
furious
stubborn
courage
and
by
dint
of
sheer
weight
crushed
or
disabled
a
greatly
inferior
foe

by

by

it

quite
as
correct

a

speak
of
macnelson
and
yet
with
it
he
captured
the
of
which
vessel
was
stronger
than
any
in
the

the
fact
that
blake
battles
were
generally
so
indecisive
must
be
ascribed
to
the
fact
that
his
opponents
were
though
inferior
in
force
superior
in
skill
no
decisive
defeat
was
inflicted
on
the

perry
operations
were

very
small
and
blake
on
a
very
large
scale
but
whereas
perry
left
no
antagonists
to
question
his
claim
to
victory
blake
successes
were
sufficiently
doubtful
to
admit
of
his
antagonists
in
almost
every
instance
claiming
that
had
won

else

perry

on

forty
times
the
strength
of
the
flotilla
but
the
way
in
which
the
work
was
done
was
very
similar
and
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
when
perry
fought
this
battle
he
was
but
years
old
and
the
commanders
of

commentary
on
the

of

of
two
sloops
the

reason
the

because

a
quotation
from
his
own
work

that
the
admiralty
had
issued
an
order
that
no

was
voluntarily
to
engage

of

coupling
this
order
with
the
results
of
the
combats
that
had
already
taken

between

of
these
classes
it
can
always
be
safely
set
down
as
sheer
bravado
when
any
talk
is
made
of
an
american
refusing
to
give

to

james
however
is
not
satisfied
with
this
and
wishes
to
prove
that
ships
were
desirous
of
avoiding
the

he
says
that
capt
stewart
came
near

to
count

saw
at

inferior
to
the

thought

therefore
did
not
make
an
effort
to

portrays
very
picturesquely
the
grief
of
the
crew
when
they
find
they
are
not
going
to
engage
how
they
come
aft
and
request
to
be
taken
into
action
how
captain
maitland
reads
them
his
instructions
but
fails
to
persuade
them
that
there
had
been
any
necessity
of
issuing
them
and
finally
how
the
sailors
overcome
by
woe
and
indignation
refuse
to
take
their
grog
which
was
certainly
remarkable
as
the
had
twice
captured
british
frigates
with
impunity
according
to
james
himself
is
it
likely
that
she
would
now
shrink
from
an
encounter
with
a
ship
which
she
saw
at
once
was
of
an
inferior
class
to
those
already
conquered
even
such
abject
cowards
as
james
americans
would
not
be
guilty
of
so
stupid
an
action
of
course
neither
capt
stewart
nor
any
one
else
supposed
for
an
instant
that
a
frigate
was
armed
with
it
is
worth
while
mentioning
as
an
instance
of
how
utterly
untrustworthy
james
is
in
dealing
with
american
affairs
that
he
says
the
had
now
what
the
americans
would
call
a
bad
crew
whereas
in
her
previous
battles
all
her
men
had
been
picked
curiously
enough
this
is
the
exact
reverse
of
the
truth
in
no
case
was
an
american
ship
manned
with
a
picked
crew
but
the
nearest
approach
to
such
was
the
crew
the
carried
in
this
and
the
next
cruise
when
she
probably
possessed
as
fine
a
crew
as
ever
manned
a
frigate
they
were
principally
new

it
has
been
said
of
them
that
they
were

not

that
hilyar

only
been
withheld
hitherto
from

attack
by
timidity
and
it
looks
all
the
worse
when
it
is
remembered
that
hilyar
owed
his
ship
previous
escape
entirely
to
porter
forbearance
on
a
former
occasion
when
the
british
frigate
was
entirely
at
his
mercy
and
that
the
british
captain
had
afterward
expressly
said
that
he
would
not
break
the
neutrality
still
the
british
in
this
war
did
not
act
very
differently

the
way

one
or
two
occasions

civil

the
sneers
which
most
of
our
historians
as
well
as
the
participators
in
the
fight
have
showered
upon
the
british
captains
for
not
foregoing
the
advantages
which
their
entire
masts
and
better
artillery
gave
them
by
coming
to
close
quarters
are
decidedly
foolish
hilyar
conduct
during
the
battle
as
well
as
his
treatment
of
the
prisoners
afterward
was
perfect
and
as
a
minor
matter
it
may
be
mentioned
that
his
official
letter
is
singularly
just
and

the
action
displayed
all
that
can
reflect
honor
on
the
science

himself
of
the
superiority

it
was
a
brilliant
affair
while
endorsing
this
criticism
it
may
be
worth
while
to
compare
it
with
some
of
the
author
comments
upon
the
other
actions
as
that
between
decatur

the

make
the
odds
here
as
great
against

they
were

it

be
necessary
to
suppose
that
the

lost
her
had
but
six
long
to
oppose
to
her
antagonist
and
that
the
latter
was
assisted
by
the

so
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
porter
fought
at
fully
double
or
treble
the
disadvantage
garden
did

instead

surrendering
when
he
had
lost
a
third
of
his
crew
fought
till
three
fifths
of
his
men
were
dead
or
wounded
and
moreover
inflicted
greater
loss
and
damage
on
his
antagonists
than
garden
did

then

lord
douglass
says
the
defence
of
the
brilliantly
upheld
the
character
of
the
british
navy
for
courage
how
much
more
did
that
of
the

for
the
american
navy

if
conduct
was
brilliant
that
of
decatur
was
more
so
this
was
an
action
in
which
it
is
difficult
to
tell
exactly
how
to
award
praise
captain
hilyar
deserves
it
for
the
coolness
and
skill
with
which
he
made
his
approaches
and
took
his
positions
so
as
to
destroy
his
adversary
with
least
loss
to
himself
and
also
for
the
precision
of
his
fire
the
cherub
behavior
was
more
remarkable
for
extreme
caution
than
for
any
thing
else
as
regards
the
mere
fight
porter
certainly
did
every
thing
a
man
could
do
to
contend
successfully
with
the
overwhelming
force
opposed
to
him
and
the
few
guns
that
were
available
were
served
with
the
utmost
precision
as
an
exhibition
of
dogged
courage
it
has
never
been
surpassed
since
the
time
when
the
dutch
captain
klaesoon
after
fighting
two
long
days
blew
up
his
disabled
ship
devoting
himself
and
all
his
crew
to
death
rather
than
surrender
to
the
hereditary
foes
of
his
race
and
was
bitterly
avenged
afterward
by
the
grim
of
holland
the
days
when
drake
singed
the

of
the
catholic
king

fame
talks
of
killed
and
mortally
wounded
severely
slightly
etc
this
would
be
no
more
worthy
of
notice
than
any
other
of
his
falsifications
were
it
not
followed
by
various
british
writers
hilyar
states
that
he
has
prisoners
has
found
dead
that
wounded
were
taken
off
between
and
reached
the
shore
and
that
the
remainder
are
either
killed
or
wounded
it
is
by
wilfully
preserving
silence
about
this
last
sentence
that
james
makes
out
his
case
it
will
be
observed
that
hilyar
enumerates
say
or
and
says
the
remainder
were
either
killed
or
wounded
porter
having
men
at
first
this
remainder
was
hilyar
stating
that
of
his
prisoners
were
wounded
his
account
thus
gives
the
americans
killed
and
wounded
james
silence
about
hilyat
last
sentence
enables
him
to
make
the
loss
but
and
his
wilful
omission
is
quite
on
a
par
with
the
other
meannesses
and
falsehoods
which
utterly
destroy
the
reliability
of
his
work
by
hilyar
own
letter
it
is
thus
seen
that
porter
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
was
certainly
perhaps
or
if
porter
had
as
james
says
men
there
still
remain
some
discrepancies
between
the
official
accounts
which
can
be
compared
in
tabular
form
hilyar
porter
prisoners
unwounded
prisoners
wounded
slightly
wounded
taken
away
wounded
severely
those
who
reached
shore
killed
remainder
killed
or
wounded
missing
killed
reached
shore
the
explanation
probably
is
that
hilyar
wounded
do
not
include
porter
slightly
wounded
and
that
his
prisoners
include
porter
who
reached
shore
and
his
who
reached
shore
comes
under
porter
missing
this
would
make
the
accounts
nearly
tally
at
any
rate
in
porter
book
are
to
be
found
the
names
of
all
his
killed
wounded
and
missing
and
their
relatives
received
pensions
from
the
american
government
which
if
the
returns
were
false
would
certainly
have
been
a
most
elaborate
piece
of
deception
it
is
far
more
likely
that
hilyar
was
mistaken
or
he
may
have
counted
in
the
crew
which
would
entirely
account
for
the
discrepancies
in
any
event
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
makes
the
american
killed
and
wounded
porter
and
as
james
says
the
latter
statement
is
wilfully
false
as
he
had
seen
hilyar
letter
he
also
bears
very
candid
testimony
to
the
defence
of
the
having
been
effective
enough
to
at
one
time
render
the
result
doubtful
saying
our
first
attack
produced
no
visible
effect
our
second
was
not
more
successful
and
having
lost
the
use
of
our
jib
and
appearances
looked
a
little
inauspicious
throughout
the
war
no
ship
was
so
desperately
defended
as
the
taking
into
account
the
frightful
odds
against
which
she
fought
which
always
enhances
the
merit
of
a
defence
the
which
suffered
even
more
was
backed
by
a
fleet
the
was
overcome
by
an
equal
foe
and
the
fought
at
far
less
of
a
disadvantage
and
suffered
less
none
of
the
frigates
british
or
american
were
defended
with
any
thing
like
the
resolution
she
displayed
but
it
is
perhaps
permissible
to
inquire
whether
porter
course
after
the
accident
to
his
occurred
was
altogether
the
best
that
could
have
been
taken
on
such
a
question
no
opinion
could
have
been
better
than
farragut
although
of
course
his
judgment
was
post
as
he
was
very
young
at
the
time
of
the
fight
in
the
first
place
i
consider
our
original
and
greatest
error
was
in
attempting
to
regain
the
anchorage
being
greatly
superior
in
sailing
powers
we
should
have
borne
up
and
run
before
the
wind
if
we
had
come
in
contact
with
the
we
should
have
carried
her
by
boarding
if
she
avoided
us
as
she
might
have
done
by
her
greater
ability
to
manoeuvre
then
we
should
have
taken
her
fire
and
passed
on
leaving
both
vessels
behind
until
we
had
replaced
our
by
which
time
they
would
have
been
separated
as
unless
they
did
so
it
would
have
been
no
chase
the
being
a
dull
sailer
secondly
when
it
was
apparent
to
everybody
that
we
had
no
chance
of
success
under
the
circumstances
the
ship
should
have
been
run
ashore
throwing
her
broadside
to
the
beach
to
prevent
raking
and
fought
as
long
as
was
consistent
with
humanity
and
then
set
on
fire
but
having
determined
upon
anchoring
we
should
have
bent
a
spring
on
to
the
ring
of
the
anchor
instead
of
to
the
cable
where
it
was
exposed
and
could
be
shot
away
as
fast
as
put
on
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
when
porter
decided
to
anchor
near
shore
in
neutral
water
he
could
not
anticipate
hilyar
deliberate
and
treacherous
breach
of
faith
i
do
not
allude
to
the
mere
disregard
of
neutrality
whatever
international
moralists
may
say
such
disregard
is
a
mere
question
of
expediency
if
the
benefits
to
be
gained
by
attacking
a
hostile
ship
in
neutral
waters
are
such
as
to
counterbalance
the
risk
of
incurring
the
enmity
of
the
neutral
power
why
then
the
attack
ought
to
be
made
had
hilyar
when
he
first
made
his
appearance
off
valparaiso
sailed
in
with
his
two
ships
the
men
at
quarters
and
guns
out
and
at
once
attacked
porter
considering
the
destruction
of
the
as
outweighing
the
insult
to
chili
why
his
behavior
would
have
been
perfectly
justifiable
in
fact
this
is
unquestionably
what
he
intended
to
do
but
he
suddenly
found
himself
in
such
a
position
that
in
the
even
of
hostilities
ship
would
be
the
captured
one
and
he
owed
his
escape
purely
to
porter
under
great
provocation
then
he
gave
his
word
to
potter
that
he
would
not
infringe
on
the
neutrality
and
he
never
dared
to
break
it
until
he
saw
porter
was
disabled
and
almost
helpless
this
may
seem
strong
language
to
use
about
a
british
officer
but
it
is
justly
strong
exactly
as
any
outsider
must
consider
warrington
attack
on
the
british
brig
in
as
a
piece
of
needless
cruelty
so
any
outsider
must
consider
hilyar
as
having
most
treacherously
broken
faith
with
porter
after
the
fight
hilyar
behaved
most
kindly
and
courteously
to
the
prisoners
and
as
already
said
he
fought
his
ship
most
ably
for
it
would
have
been
quixotic
to
a
degree
to
forego
his
advantages
but
previous
to
the
battle
his
conduct
had
been
it
was
to
be
expected
that
the
would
make
her
escape
as
soon
as
practicable
and
so
he
should
have
used
every
effort
to
bring
her
to
action
instead
of
this
he
always
declined
the
fight
when
alone
and
he
owed
his
ultimate
success
to
the
fact
that
the
instead
of
escaping
as
she
could
several
times
have
done
stayed
hoping
to
bring
the
to
action
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
was
almost
as
weak
compared
to
the
as
the
was
compared
to
the
the
latter
was
just
about
midway
between
the
british
ships
as
may
be
seen
by
the
following
comparison
in
the
action
the
fought
all
six
of
her
long
and
the
both
her
long
instead
of
the
corresponding
broadside
carronades
which
the
ships
regularly
used
this
gives
the
a
better
armament
than
she
would
have
had
fighting
her
guns
as
they
were
regularly
used
but
it
can
be
seen
how
great
the
inequality
still
was
it
must
also
be
kept
in
mind
that
while
in
the
battles
between
the
american
and
british
the
short
weight
of
the
former
had
in
reality
no
greater
range
or
accuracy
than
the
full
weight
of
their
opponents
in
this
case
the
full
weight
had
a
very
much
greater
range
and
accuracy
than
the
short
weight
of
the
comparative
force

this
would
make

i
would
have
no
doubt
that
the
american
accounts
were
right
if
the
question
rested
solely
on
james
veracity
but
he
probably
took
his
figures
from
official
sources
at
any
rate
remembering
the
difference
between
long
guns
and
carronades
it
appears
that
the
was
really
nearly
intermediate
in
force
between
the
and
the
the
battle
being
fought
with
a
very
trifling
exception
at
long
range
it
was
in
reality
a
conflict
between
a
crippled
ship
throwing
a
broadside
of
lbs
of
metal
and
two
ships
throwing
who
by
their
ability
to
manoeuvre
could
choose
positions
where
they
could
act
with
full
effect
while
their
antagonist
could
not
return
a
shot
contemporary
history
does
not
afford
a
single
instance
of
so
determined
a
defence
against
such
frightful
odds
the
official
letters
of
captains
hilyar
and
porter
agree
substantially
in
all
respects
the
details
of
the
fight
as
seen
in
the
are
found
in
the
life
of
farragut
but
although
the
british
captain
does
full
justice
to
his
foe
british
historians
have
universally
tried
to
belittle
porter
conduct
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
we
have
no
british
account
worth
paying
attention
to
of
the
proceedings
before
the
fight
when
the
declined
single
combat
with
the
james
of
course
states
that
the
did
not
decline
it
but
he
gives
no
authority
and
his
unsupported
assertion
would
be
valueless
even
if
uncontradicted
his
account
of
the
action
is
grossly
inaccurate
as
he
has
inexcusably
garbled
hilyar
report
one
instance
of
this
i
have
already
mentioned
as
regards
account
of
porter
loss
again
hilyar
distinctly
states
that
the
was
twice
on
fire
yet
james
utterly
denies
this
thereby
impliedly
accusing
the
british
captain
of
falsehood
there
is
really
no
need
of
the
corroboration
of
porter
letter
but
he
has
it
most
fully
in
the
life
of
farragut
the
men
came
rushing
up
from
below
many
with
their
clothes
burning
which
were
torn
from
them
as
quickly
as
possible
and
those
for
whom
this
could
not
be
done
were
told
to
jump
overboard
and
quench
the
flames
one
man
swam
to
shore
with
scarcely
a
square
inch
of
his
body
which
had
not
been
burned
and
although
he
was
deranged
for
some
days
he
ultimately
recovered
and
afterward
served
with
me
in
the
west
indies
the
third
unfounded
statement
in
james
account
is
that
buckets
of
spirits
were
found
in
all
parts
of
the
main
deck
of
the
and
that
most
of
the
prisoners
were
drunk
no
authority
is
cited
for
this
and
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
truth
in
it
he
ends
by
stating
that
few
even
in
his
own
country
will
venture
to
speak
well
of
captain
david
porter
after
these
various
paragraphs
we
are
certainly
justified
in
rejecting
james
account
an
occasional
mistake
is
perfectly
excusable
and
gross
ignorance
of
a
good
many
facts
does
not
invalidate
a
man
testimony
with
regard
to
some
others
with
which
he
is
acquainted
but
a
wilful
and
systematic
perversion
of
the
truth
in
a
number
of
cases
throws
a
very
strong
doubt
on
a
historian
remaining
statements
unless
they
are
supported
by
unquestionable
authority
but
if
british
historians
have
generally
given
porter
much
less
than
his
due
by
omitting
all
reference
to
the
inferiority
of
his
guns
his
lost
it
is
no
worse
than
americans
have
done
in
similar
cases
the
latter
for
example
will
make
great
allowances
in
the
case
of
the

her
having
carronades
only
but
utterly
fail
to
allude
to
the
and
as
having
suffered
under
the
same
disadvantage
they
should
remember
that
the
rules
cut
both
ways

suffered
chiefly
above
the
waterline

was
repaired
sufficiently
in
valparaiso
to
enable
her
to
make
the
voyage
to
england
where
she
was
added
to
the
british
navy
the
was
disarmed
and
the
american
prisoners
embarked
in
her
for
new
york
on
parole
but

of

burnt
or
sunk
by

americans
and
some
retaken
by

british
and
so
after
nearly
two
years
uninterrupted
success
the
career
of
the
terminated
amid
disasters
of
all
kinds
but
at
least
her
officers
and
crew
could
reflect
that
they
had
afforded
an
example
of
courage
in
adversity
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
match
elsewhere
the
first
of
the
new
heavy
sloops
of
war
that
got
to
sea
was
the
master
commandant
joseph
bainbridge
which
put
out
early
in
february
shortly
afterward
she
encountered
a
large
carthagenian
privateer
which
refused
to
surrender
and
was
sunk
by
a
broadside

a
hundred
of
her
crew
being
drowned

the
schooner
soon
weathered
the

of
course
was
afraid
to
close
and
the
american
sloop
continued
beating
to
windward
in
the
effort
to
escape
for
nearly
hours
the
water
was
started
the
anchors
cut
away
and
finally
the
guns
thrown
overboard
a
measure
by
means
of
which
both
the
the
and
the
succeeded
in
escaping
under
similar
circumstances
but
all
was
of
no
avail
and
she
was
finally
captured
the
court
of
inquiry
honorably
acquitted
both
officers
and
crew
as
was
to
be
expected
james
considers
the
surrender
a
disgraceful
one
because
the
guns
were
thrown
overboard
as
i
have
said
this
was
a
measure
which
had
proved
successful

ensued

caught

promptly
chased

not

conclusively
that
their
ill
success
on

was
due
to
the

not

look
out
for

fleet
he
found
this

on

the
discovery
failed
to
do
him
much
good
as
the
ships
were
under
the
convoy
of
a

frigates

brigs

on

in

order
and
the
six
war
vessels
exercised
the
greatest
vigilance
so
the
corvette
passed
northward
to
the
newfoundland
banks
where
she
met
with
nothing
but
fogs
and
floating
ice
and
then
turned
her
prow
toward
ireland
on
july
she
made
out
and
chased
two

escaped

of

to

made
a
few
prizes
then
in
lat
long
on
july
she
stumbled
across
the
frigate
capt
henderson
the
frigate
was
to
leeward
and
a
hard
chase
ensued
it
was
only
by
dint
of
cutting
away
her
anchors
and
throwing
overboard
some
of
her
guns
that
the
held
her
own
till
sunset

it
fell

capt
morris
and
his
first
lieutenant
wadsworth
had
been
the
first

second
lieutenants
of

hull
famous
cruise

they
proved
that
they
had
not
forgotten
their
early
experience
for
they
got
out
the
boats
to
tow
and
employed
their
time
so
well
that
by
sunrise
the
frigate
was
two
leagues
astern
after
hours
more
chase
the
dropped
her
but
in
a
day
or
two
she
ran
across
a
couple
more
one
of
which
an
old
was
soon
thrown
out
but
the
other
was
very
fast
and
kept
close
on
the
corvette
heels
as
before
the
frigate
was
to
leeward
the
had
been
built
by
contract
one
side
was
let
to
a
of
economical
instincts
and
accordingly
turned
out
rather
shorter
than
the
other
the
result
was
the
ship
sailed
a
good
deal
faster
on
one
tack
than
on
the
other
in
this
chase
she
finally
got
on
her
good
tack
in
the
night
and
so
escaped

to

was
by

and
consisted
mainly
in
forcing
us
to

the

the

was

the
difference
in

inflicted
was
so
very
great
that
i
doubt
if
the
result
would
have
been
affected
if
the
odds
had
been
reversed
in
the

that
of

fought

still
greater

out

full
as
much

the

no

help
feeling
the
most
honest
admiration
for
the
unflinching
courage
and
cool
skill
displayed
by
capt
manners
and
his
crew
it
is
worthy
of
notice
remembering
the
sneers
of
so
many
of
the
british
authors
at
the
wary
circumspection
of
the
americans
that
capt
manners
who
has
left
a
more
honorable
name
than
any
other
british
commander
of
the
war
excepting
capt
broke
behaved
with
the
greatest
caution
as
long
as
it
would
serve
his
purpose
while
he
showed
the
most
splendid
personal
courage
afterward
it
is
this
combination
of
courage
and
skill
that
made
him
so
dangerous
an
antagonist
it
showed
that
the
traditional
british
bravery
was
not
impaired
by
refusing
to
adhere
to
the
traditional
british
tactics
of
rushing
into
a
fight
needless
exposure
to
danger
denotes
not
so
much
pluck
as
stupidity
capt
manners
had
no
intention
of
giving
his
adversary
any
advantage
he
could
prevent
no
one
can
help
feeling
regret
that
he
was
killed
but
if
he
was
to
fall
what
more
glorious
death
could
he
meet
it
must
be
remembered
that
while
paying
all
homage
to
capt
manners
capt
blakely
did
equally
well
it
was
a
case
where
the

where
he
appeared

blockade
this
was
especially
troublesome
because
most
of

had
not

though
the

the

go

the
very
important
duty
of
convoying
these
great

woolsey
an
officer
of

decided

them
by

they
might

me

you
sir

will
not

chauncy
replied

shall
afford
every
assistance
in
my
power
to
cooperate
with
the
army

it
can
be
done
without
losing
sight
of
the
great
object
for
the
attainment
of
which
this
fleet
has
been
created

capture
or
destruction
of
the
fleet
but
that
i
consider
the
primary
object
we
are
intended
to
seek
and
fight
the
enemy
fleet
and
i
shall
not
be
diverted
from
my
efforts
to
effectuate
it
by
any
sinister
attempt
to
render
us
subordinate
to
or
an
appendage
of
the
army
that
is
by
any
sinister
attempt
to
make
him
cooperate
intelligently

really
scheme
of

of
these
noble
and
independent
sentiments

writes
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy
on
august
footnote
see
niles
vii
and
other
places
under
chauncy
in
index
i
told
general
brown
that
i
should
not
visit
the
head
of
the
lake
unless
the
enemy
fleet
did
so
to
deprive
the
enemy
of
an
apology
for
not
meeting
me
i
have
sent
ashore
four
guns
from
the
to
reduce
her
armament
in
number
to
an
equality
with
the
yielding
the
advantage
of
their
the
mounts
two
guns
less
than
the
and
the
and
are
equal
to
the
and
he
here
justifies
his
refusal
to
with
general
brown
by
saying
that
he
was
of
only
equal
force
with
sir
james
and
that
he
has
deprived
the
latter
of
an
apology
for
not
meeting
him
this
last
was
not
at
all
true
the
and
were
just
about
equal
to
the
and
but
the
was
half
as
strong
again
as
the
and
chauncy
could
very
well
afford
to
yield
the
advantage
of
their
when
in
return
sir
james
had
to
yield
the
advantage
of
chauncy
long
and
carronades
the
was
a
frigate
and
even
without
her
four
extra
guns
was
about
a
fourth
heavier
than
the
with
her
sir
james
was
not
acting
more
warily
than
chauncy
had
acted
during
june
and
july
then
he
had
a
fleet
which
tonned
was
manned
by
men
and
threw
at
a
broadside
lbs
of
shot
and
he
declined
to
go
out
of
port
or
in
any
way
try
to
check
the
operation
of
yeo
fleet
which
tonned
was
manned
by
men
and
threw
at
a
broadside
lbs
of
shot
chauncy
then
acted
perfectly
proper
no
doubt
but
he
could
not
afford
to
sneer
at
yeo
for
behaving
in
the
same
way
whatever
either
commander
might
write
in
reality
he
well
knew
that
his
officers
and
crews
were
man
for
man
just
about
on
a
par
with
those
of
his
antagonists
and
so
after
the
first
brush
or
two
he
was
exceedingly
careful
to
see
that
the
odds
were
not
against
him
chauncy
in
his
petulant
answers
to
letter
ignored
the
fact
that
his
superiority
of
force
would
prevent
his
opponent
from
giving
battle
and
would
therefore
prevent
any
thing
more
important
than
a
blockade
occurring
his
ideas
of
the
purpose
for
which
his
command
had
been
created
were
erroneous
and
very
hurtful
to
the
american
cause
that
purpose
was
not
except
incidentally
the
destruction
of
the
enemy
fleet
and
if
it
was
he
entirely
failed
to
accomplish
it
the
real
purpose
was
to
enable
canada
to
be
successfully
invaded
or
to
assist
in
repelling
an
invasion
of
the
united
states
these
services
could
only
be
efficiently
performed
by
acting
in
union
with
the
for
his
independent
action
could
evidently
have
little
effect
the
only
important
services
he
had
performed
had
been
in
attacking
forts
george
and
york
where
he
been
rendered
subordinate
to
and
an
appendage
of
the
army
his
only
chance
of
accomplishing
any
thing
lay
in
similar
acts
of
cooperation
and
he
refused
to
do
these
had
he
acted
as
he
ought
to
have
done
and
assisted
brown
to
the
utmost
he
would
certainly
have
accomplished
much
more
than
he
did
and
might
have
enabled
brown
to
assault
kingston
when
yeo
fleet
would
of
course
have
been
captured
the
insubordination
petty
stickling
for
his
own
dignity
and
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
necessity
of
acting
in
concert
that
he
showed
were
the
very
faults
which
proved
most
fatal
to
the
success
of
our
various
land
commanders
in
the
early
part
of
the
war
even
had
chauncy
assistance
availed
nothing
he
could
not
have
accomplished
less
than
he
did
he
remained
off
kingston
blockading
yeo
being
once
or
twice
blown
off
by
gales
he
sent
lieutenant
gregory
accompanied
by
midshipman
hart
and
six
men
in
to
reconnoitre
on
august
the
lieutenant
ran
across
two
barges
containing
men
and
was
captured
after
the
midshipman
had
been
killed
and
the
lieutenant
and
four
men
wounded
on
september
he
transported
general
izard
and
men
from
sackett
harbor
to
the
genesee
and
then
again
blockaded
kingston
until
the
was
nearly
completed
when
he
promptly
retired
to
the
harbor
the
equally
cautious
yeo
did
not
come
out
on
the
lake
till
he
did
not
indulge
in
the
empty
and
useless
formality
of
blockading
his
antagonist
but
assisted
the
british
army
on
the
niagara
frontier
till
navigation
closed
about
a
couple
of
days
before
midshipman
mcgowan
headed
an
expedition
to
blow
up
the
named
the
with
a
torpedo
but
was
discovered
by
two
of
the
enemy
boats
which
he
captured
and
brought
in
the
attempt
was
abandoned
because
the
was
found
not
to
be
lying
in
kingston
for
this
year
the
material
loss
again
fell
heaviest
on
the
british
amounting
to
one
brig
burned
by
her
crew
one
schooner
burned
on
the
stocks
three
three
cutters
and
one
gig
captured
while
in
return
the
americans
lost
one
schooner
loaded
with
seven
guns
one
boat
loaded
with
two
and
a
gig
captured
and
four
guns
destroyed
at
oswego
in
men
the
british
loss
was
heavier
still
relatively
to
that
of
the
americans
being
in
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
about
to
but
in
spite
of
this
loss
and
damage
which
was
too
trivial
to
be
of
any
account
to
either
side
the
success
of
the
season
was
with
the
british
inasmuch
as
they
held
command
over
the
lake
for
more
than
four
months
during
which
time
they
could
co√∂perate
with
their
army
while
the
americans
held
it
for
barely
two
months
and
a
half
in
fact
the
conduct
of
the
two
fleets
on
lake
ontario
during
the
latter
part
of
the
war
was
almost
farcical
as
soon
as
one
by
building
acquired
the
superiority
the
foe
at
once
retired
to
port
where
he
waited
until
had
built
another
vessel
or
two
when
he
came
out
and
the
other
went
into
port
in
turn
under
such
circumstances
it
was
hopeless
ever
to
finish
the
contest
by
a
each
commander
calculating
the
chances
with
mathematical
exactness
the
only
hope
of
destroying
the
enemy
fleet
was
by
cooperating
with
the
in
a
successful
attack
on
his
main
post
when
he
would
be
forced
to
be
either
destroyed
or
to
fight
and
this
cooperation
chauncy
refused
to
give
he
seems
to
have
been
an
excellent
organizer
but
he
did
not
use
certainly
not
in
the
summer
of
his
materials
by
any
means
to
the
best
advantage
he
was
hardly
equal
to
his
opponent
and
the
latter
seems
to
have
been
little
more
than
an
average
officer
yeo
blundered
several
times
as
in
the
attack
on
sackett
harbor
in
not
following
up
his
advantage
at
oswego
in
showing
so
little
resource
in
the
action
off
the
genesee
and
he
was
not
troubled
by
any
excess
of
daring
but
during
the
period
when
he
was
actually
cruising
against
chauncy
on
the
lake
he
certainly
showed
to
better
advantage
than
the
american
did
with
an
inferior
force
he
won
a
partial
victory
over
his
opponent
off
niagara
and
then
kept
him
in
check
for
six
weeks
while
chauncy
with
his
superior
force
was
not
only
partially
defeated
once
but
when
he
did
gain
a
partial
victory
failed
to
take
advantage
of
it
in
commenting
upon
the
timid
and
dilatory
tactics
of
the
two
commanders
on
ontario
however
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
indecisive
nature
of
the
results
attained
had
been
often
paralleled
by
the
numerous
similar
encounters
that
took
place
on
the
ocean
during
the
wars
of
the
preceding
century
in
the
war
of
the
american
revolution
the
english
fought
some
fleet
actions
with
the
french
dutch
and
spaniards
one
victory
was
gained
over
the
french
and
one
over
the
spaniards
while
the
others
were
all
indecisive
both
sides
claiming
the
victory
and
neither
winning
it
of
course
some
of
them
though
indecisive
as
regards
loss
and
damage
were
strategetical
victories
thus
admiral
arbuthnot
beat
back
admiral
barras
off
the
chesapeake
in
march
of
and
near
the
same
place
in
september
of
the
same
year
the
french
had
their
revenge
in
the
victory
one
at
least
in
its
results
of
the
comte
de
grasse
over
sir
thomas
graves
in
the
five
desperate
and
bloody
combats
which
de
suffrein
waged
with
sir
edward
hughes
in
the
east
indies
the
laurels
were
very
evenly
divided
these
five
conflicts
were
not
rendered
indecisive
by
any
overwariness
in
manoeuvring
for
de
suffrein
attacks
were
carried
out
with
as
much
boldness
as
skill
and
his
stubborn
antagonist
was
never
inclined
to
baulk
him
of
a
fair
battle
but
the
two
hardy
fighters
were
so
evenly
matched
that
they
would
pound
one
another
till
each
was
helpless
to
inflict
injury
very
different
were
the
three
consecutive
battles
that
took
place
in
the
same
waters
on
the
of
april
the
of
august
and
on
the
of

up
with
the
following
excellent
criticism
footnote
i
pay
more
attention
to
the
sense
than
to
the
letter
in
my
translation
it
is
this
battle
won
by
hawke
the
of
november
and
the
combats
of
pocock
and
from
which
date
two
distinct
schools
in
the
naval
affairs
of
the
century
one
of
these
was
all
for
promptness
and
audacity
which
were
regarded
as
the
indispensable
conditions
for
victory
the
other
on
the
contrary
praised
skilful
delays
and
able
evolutions
and
created
success
by
science
united
to
prudence
but
these
two
schools
were
true
only
according
to
circumstances
not
absolutely
when
two
fleets
of
equal
worth
are
facing
one
another
as
in
the
war
of
the
american
revolution
then
tactics
should
come
into
play
and
audacity
would
often
be
mere
foolhardiness
if
it
happens
on
the
other
hand
as
in
the
republic
or
during
the
last
years
of
louis
xv
that
an
irresolute
fleet
without
organization
has
to
contend
with
a
fleet
prepared
in
every
way
then
on
the
part
of
this
last
audacity
is
wisdom
and
prudence
would
be
cowardice
for
it
would
give
an
enemy
who
distrusts
himself
time
to
become
more
hardy
the
only
school
always
true
is
that
one
which
freed
from
all
routine
produces
men
whose
genius
will
unite
in
one
in
knowing
how
to
apply
them
appropriately
the
audacity
which
will
carry
off
victory
and
the
prudence
which
knows
how
to
obtain
it
in
preparing
for
it
these
generalizations
are
drawn
from
the
results
of
mighty
battles
but
they
apply
just
as
well
to
the
campaigns
carried
on
on
a
small
scale
or
even
to
actions
chauncy
as
already
said
does
not
deserve
the
praise
which
most
american
historians
and
especially
cooper
have
lavished
on
him
as
well
as
on
all
our
other
officers
of
that
period
such
indiscriminate
eulogy
entirely
detracts
from
the
worth
of
a
writer
favorable
criticisms
our
commander
was
i
firmly
believe
at
that
time
superior
to
the
average
commander
of
any
other
nation
but
to
get
at
this
average
we
must
include
chauncy
rodgers
and
angus
as
well
as
hull
macdonough
perry
porter
bainbridge
biddle
lawrence
and
warrington
sir
james
yeo
did
to
the
full
as
well
as
his
opponent
and
like
him
was
a
good
organizer
but
he
did
little
enough
his
campaigns
must
be
considered
as
being
conducted
well
or
ill
according
as
he
is
believed
to
have
commanded
better
men
than
his
opponent
or
not
if
as
many
british
writers
contend
his
crews
were
an
overmatch
for
the
americans
man
for
man
even
to
a
slight
degree
then
yeo
conduct
was
very
cowardly
if
on
the
contrary
the
officers
and
men
of
the
two
fleets
were
on
a
par
then
he
acted
properly
and
outgeneralled
his
opponent
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
most
of
the
histories
written
on
the
subject
on
either
side
of
the
atlantic
should
be
of
the
hurrah
order
of
literature
with
no
attempt
whatever
to
get
at
the
truth
but
merely
to
explain
away
the
defeats
or
immensely
exaggerate
the
victories
suffered
or
gained
by
their
own
side
erie
and
the
upper
lakes
hitherto
the
vessels
on
these
lakes
as
well
as
on
ontario
had
been
under
the
command
of
commodore
chauncy
but
they
were
now
formed
into
a
separate
department
under
captain
arthur
sinclair
the
americans
had
of
course
complete
supremacy
and
no
attempt
was
seriously
made
to
contest
it
with
them
but
they
received
a
couple
of
stinging
if
not
very
important
defeats
it
is
rather
singular
that
here
the
british
who
began
with
a
large
force
while
there
was
none
whatever
to
oppose
it
should
have
had
it
by
degrees
completely
annihilated
and
should
have
then
and
not
till
then
when
apparently
rendered
harmless
have
turned
round
and
partially
revenged
themselves
by
two
expeditions
which
were
as
boldly
executed
as
they
were
skilfully
planned
captain
sinclair
sailed
into
lake
huron
with
the
and
and
on
july
burnt
the
fort
and
barracks
of
joseph
which
were
abandoned
by
their
garrison
on
he
arrived
off
the
fort
of
machilimacinac
mackinaw
which
was
situated
on
such
an
eminence
that
the
guns
of
the
vessels
could
not
reach
it
accordingly
the
troops
under
croghan
were
landed
covered
by
the
fire
of
the
schooners
very
successfully
but
when
they
tried
to
carry
the
fort
they
were
driven
back
with
the
loss
of
men
thence
sinclair
sailed
to
the
nattagawassa
creek
attacked
and
destroyed
a
three
miles
up
it

mounted
three
light
guns
and
also
a
schooner

by

within
fifty
yards
when

at

daring
expedition

the
three
american
schooners
and

with

repassing
continually

cut
his
cables

ran
him
aboard

volley
of

wounded

get
on

the
british

were
alongside

the

had
hurried
on

lost

killed

sword
in

the
was
not
molested
and
made
no

interfere
with
the
british
in
their
retreat
so
they
drifted
down
the
rapids
with
their
two
prizes

the
boldness
of
this
enterprise
will
be
appreciated
when
it
is
remembered
that
but
british
seamen
unless
there
were
some
militia
along
with
no
artillery
attacked
and
captured
two
out
of
three
fine
schooners
armed
each
with
a
long
or
and
an
aggregate
of
men
and
that
this
had
been
done
in
waters
where
the
gig
and
five
batteaux
of
the
victors
were
the
only
british
vessels
afloat
champlain
this
lake
which
had
hitherto
played
but
an
inconspicuous
part
was
now
to
become
the
scene
of
the
greatest
naval
battle
of
the
war
a
british
army
of
men
under
sir
george
prevost
undertook
the
invasion
of
new
york
by
advancing
up
the
western
bank
of
lake
champlain
this
advance
was
impracticable
unless
there
was
a
sufficiently
strong
british
naval
force
to
drive
back
the
american
squadron
at
the
same
time
accordingly
the
british
began
to
construct
a
frigate
the
to
be
added
to
their
already
existing
force
which
consisted
of
a
brig
two
sloops
and
or
the
americans
already
possessed
a
heavy
corvette
a
schooner
a
small
sloop
and
or
they
now
began
to
build
a
large
brig
the
which
was
launched
about
the
of
august
nine
days
later
on
the
the

launched
the
two
squadrons

erie
macdonough
and
downie
were
hurried
into
action
before
they
had
time
to
prepare
themselves
thoroughly
but
it
was
a
disadvantage
common
to
both
and
arose
from
the
nature
of
the
case
which
called
for
immediate
action
the
british
army
advanced
slowly
toward
plattsburg
which
was
held
by
general
macomb
with
less
than
effective
american
troops
captain
thomas
macdonough
the
american
commodore
took
the
lake
a
day
or
two
before
his
antagonist
and
came
to
anchor
in

numerous

substitutes

he
gives
no

the

it

british

that

manifestly
and
vastly
inferior

the

ours

while
the
difference
in

and
in
the
number
of
their

was
still
more
in
their

none
of
these
historians

have
made
the
faintest

find

the
facts
for

following
james

with
blind
reliance
and
accordingly
it
is
only
necessary
to
discuss
the
latter
this
reputable
gentleman
ends
his
account
naval

by
remarking
that
macdonough
wrote
as
he
did
because
he
knew
that
nothing
would
stamp
a
falsehood
with
currency
equal
to
a
pious
expression
his
falsehoods
equalling
in
number
the
lines
of
his
letter
these
remarks
are
interesting
as
showing
the
unbiassed
and
truthful
character
of
the
author
rather
than
for
any
particular
weight
they
will
have
in
influencing
any
one
judgment
on
commodore
macdonough
james
gives
the
engaged
force
of
the
british
as

of

with

of
shot
to
reduce
the
force
down
to

are

the
letter
is
given
in
full
in
the

what
james
means
can
not
be
imagined
no
stretch
of
language
will
convert

james
statement
counting
her
crew
only
as
he
gives
it
we
get

men
lbs
of
shot
james
also
excludes
five
because
they
ran
away
almost
as
soon
as
the
action
commenced
vol
vi
this
assertion
is
by
no
means
equivalent
to
the
statement
in
captain
pring
letter
that
the
flotilla
of
had
abandoned
the
object
assigned
to
them
and
if
it
was
it
would
not
warrant
his
excluding
the
five
their
flight
may
have
been
disgraceful
but
they
formed
part
of
the
attacking
force
nevertheless
almost
any
general
could
say
that
he
had
won
against
superior
numbers
if
he
refused
to
count
in
any
of
his
own
men
whom
he
suspected
of
behaving
badly
james
gives
his
men
and
guns
two
long
five
long
six
carronades
and
makes
them
average
tons
adding
on
the
five
he
leaves
out
we
get
vessels
of
tons
with
men
throwing
at
a
broadside
lbs
of
shot
from
long
guns
from
carronades
but
sir
george
prevost
in
the
letter
already
quoted
says
there
were
and
the
american
accounts
say
more
supposing
the
two
james
did
not
include
at
all
to
be
equal
respectively
to
one
of
the
largest
and
one
of
the
smallest
of
the
as
he
gives
them
naval
occurrences
that
is
one
to
have
had
men
a
long
and
a
carronade
the
other
men
and
a
carronade
we
get
for
downie
force
vessels
of
tons
with
men
throwing
at
a
broadside
lbs
of
shot
from
long
guns
from
carronades
it
must
be
remembered
that
so
far
i
have
merely
corrected
james
by
means
of
the
authorities
from
which
he
draws
his
account
the
official
letters
of
the
british
commanders
i
have
not
brought
up
a
single
american
authority
against
him
but
have
only
made
such
alterations
as
a
writer
could
with
nothing
whatever
but
the
accounts
of
sir
george
prevost
and
captain
pring
before
him
to
compare
with
james
thus
it
is
seen
that
according
to
james
himself
downie
really
had
men
to
macdonough
and
threw
at
a
broadside
lbs
of
shot
to
macdonough
lbs
james
says
naval
occurrences
pp
let
it
be
recollected
no
musketry
was
employed
on
either
side
and
the
marines
were
of
no
use
as
the
action
was
fought
out
of
the
range
of
musketry
the
additional
men
on
the
part
of
the
americans
were
thus
not
of
much
consequence
the
action
being
fought
at
anchor
and
there
being
men
enough
to
manage
the
guns
and
perform
every
other
duty
so
we
need
only
attend
to
the
broadside
force
here
then
downie
could
present
at
a
broadside
lbs
of
shot
from
long
guns
to
macdonough
and
lbs
from
carronades
to
macdonough
or
he
threw
lbs
of
shot
more
from
his
long
guns
and
less
from
his
carronades
this
is
equivalent
to
downie
having
seven
long
and
one
long
and
macdonough
having
one
and
six
carronades
a
carronade
is
not
equal
to
a
long
so
that
by
james
own
showing
downie
force
was
slightly
the
thus
far
i
may
repeat
i
have
corrected
james
solely
by
the
evidence
of
his
own
side
now
i
shall
bring
in
some
american
authorities
these
do
not
contradict
the
british
official
letters
for
they
virtually
agree
with
them
but
they
do
go
against
james
unsupported
assertions
and
being
made
by
naval
officers
of
irreproachable
reputation
will
certainly
outweigh
them
in
the
first
place
james
asserts
that
on
the
of
the
but
guns
were
presented
in
broadside
two
carronades
being
thrust
through
the
and
two
others
through
the
so
he
excludes
two
of
her
guns
from
the
broadside
such
guns
would
have
been
of
great
use
to
her
at
certain
stages
of
the
combat
and
ought
to
be
included
in
the
force
but
besides
this
the
american
officers
positively
say
that
she
had
a
of
guns
adding
these
two
guns
and
making
a
trifling
change
in
the
arrangement
of
the
guns
in
the
we
get
a
broadside
of
exactly
as
i
have
given
it
above
there
is
no
difficulty
in
accounting
for
the
difference
of
tonnage
as
given
by
james
and
by
the
americans
for
we
have
considered
the
same
subject
in
reference
to
the
battle
of
lake
erie
james
calculates
the
american
tonnage
as
if
for
of
deep
holds
while
as
regards
the
british
vessels
he
allows
for
the
shallow
holds
that
all
the
lake
craft
had
that
is
he
gives
in
one
the
nominal
in
the
other
the
real
tonnage
this
fully
accounts
for
the
discrepancy
it
only
remains
to
account
for
the
difference
in
the
number
of
men
from
james
we
can
get
in
the
first
place
we
can
reason
by
analogy
i
have
already
shown
that
as
regards
the
battle
of
lake
erie
he
is
convicted
by
english
not
by
american
evidence
of
having
underestimated
barclay
force
by
about
per
cent
if
he
did
the
same
thing
here
the
british
force
was
over
strong
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
was
but
we
have
other
proofs
on
of
the
naval
occurrences
he
says
the
complement
of
the
four
captured
british
vessels
amounted
to
men
of
whom
were
killed
in
action
leaving
prisoners
including
the
wounded
but
the
report
of
prisoners
as
given
by
the
american
authorities
gives
officers
and
seamen
unhurt
or
but
slightly
wounded
wounded
men
paroled
and
other
wounded
whose
number
was
unspecified
supposing
this
number
to
have
been
and
adding
dead
we
would
get
in
all
men
for
the
four
ships
the
number
i
have
adopted
in
my
list
this
would
make
the
british
wounded
instead
of
as
james
says
but
neither
the
americans
nor
the
british
seem
to
have
enumerated
all
their
wounded
in
this
fight
taking
into
account
all
these
considerations
it
will
be
seen
that
the
figures
i
have
given
are
probably
approximately
correct
and
at
any
rate
indicate
pretty
closely
the
strength
of
the
two
squadrons
the
slight
differences
in
tonnage
and
crews
tons
and
men
in
favor
of
the
british
are
so
trivial
that
they
need
not
be
taken
into
account
and
we
will
merely
consider
the
broadside
force
in
absolute
weight
of
metal
the
two
combatants
were
evenly
matched
almost
exactly
but
whereas
from
downie
broadside
of
lbs
were
from
long
and
from
short
guns
of
broadside
of
but
were
from
long
and
from
short
pieces
the
forces
were
thus
equal
except
that
downie
opposed
lbs
from
long
guns
to
from
carronades
as
if
long
were
opposed
to
ten
carronades
this
would
make
the
odds
on
their
face
about
to
against
the
americans
in
reality
they
were
greater
for
the
possession
of
the
was
a
very
great
advantage
the
action
is
as
regards
metal
the
exact
reverse
of
those
between
chauncy
and
yeo
take
for
example
the
fight
off
burlington
on
yeo
broadside
was
lbs
to
chauncy
but
whereas
only
of
yeo
was
from
long
guns
of
chauncy
but
was
from
carronades
chauncy
fleet
was
thus
much
the
superior
at
least
we
must
say
this
if
macdonough
beat
merely
an
equal
force
then
yeo
made
a
most
disgraceful
and
cowardly
flight
before
an
inferior
foe
but
if
we
contend
that
macdonough
force
was
inferior
to
that
of
his
antagonist
then
we
must
admit
that
yeo
was
in
like
manner
inferior
to
chauncy
these
rules
work
both
ways
the
was
a
heavier
vessel
than
the
presenting
in
broadside
one
long
and
three
carronades
more
than
the
latter
james
vol
vi
says
the
alone
was
nearly
a
match
for
sir
james
yeo
squadron
and
brenton
says
vol
ii
the
was
more
than
a
match
for
the
whole
british
squadron
neither
of
these
writers
means
quite
as
much
as
he
says
for
the
logical
result
would
be
that
the
alone
was
a
match
for
all
of
macdonough
force
still
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
gave
chauncy
a
great
advantage
and
that
the
made
downie
fleet
much
superior
to
macdonough
macdonough
saw
that
the
british
would
be
forced
to
make
the
attack
in
order
to
get
the
control
of
the
waters
on
this
long
narrow
lake
the
winds
usually
blow
pretty
nearly
north
or
south
and
the
set
of
the
current
is
of
course
northward
all
the
vessels
being
flat
and
shallow
could
not
beat
to
windward
well
so
there
was
little
chance
of
the
british
making
the
attack
when
there
was
a
southerly
wind
blowing
so
late
in
the
season
there
was
danger
of
sudden
and
furious
gales
which
would
make
it
risky
for
downie
to
wait
outside
the
bay
till
the
wind
suited
him
and
inside
the
bay
the
wind
was
pretty
sure
to
be
light
and
baffling
young
macdonough
then
but
years
of
age
calculated
all
these
chances
very
coolly
and
decided
to
await
the
attack
at
anchor
in
plattsburg
bay
with
the
head

away

galleys
the
battle
at
the
foot
of
the
line
was
fought
on
the
part
of
the
americans
to
prevent
their
flank
being
turned
and
on
the
part
of
the
british
to
effect
that
object
at
first
the
fighting
was
at
long
range
but
gradually
the
british
galleys
closed
up
firing
very
well
the
american
galleys
at
this
end
of
the
line
were
chiefly
the
small
ones
armed
with
one
apiece
and
they
by
degrees
drew
back
before
the
heavy
fire
of
their
opponents
about
an
hour
after
the
discharge
of
the
first
gun
had
been
fired

toward

completely
crippled
by

of
broadsides

the
latter

drifted
helplessly
down
the
line
and
grounded
near
crab
island

of
the
convalescent
patients
manned
the

fired
a
shot
or
two
at
her
when
she
struck
nearly
half
of
her
crew
being
killed
or
wounded
about
the
same
time
the
british
forced
the
out
of
line
whereupon
she
cut
her
cable
and
drifted
inshore
out
of
the
fight
two
or
three
of
the
british
had
already
been
sufficiently
damaged
by
some
of
the
shot
from
the
long
guns
to
make
them
wary
and
the
contest
at
this
part
of
the
line
narrowed
down
to
one
between
the
american
schooner
and
the
remaining
british
who
combined
to
make
a
most
determined
attack
upon
her
so
hastily
had
the
squadron
been
fitted
out
that
many
of
the
matches
for
her
guns
were
at
the
last
moment
found
to
be
defective
the
captain
of
one
of
the
divisions
was
a
midshipman
but
sixteen
years
old
hiram
paulding
when
he
found
the
matches
to
be
bad
he
fired
the
guns
of
his
section
by
having
pistols
flashed
at
them
and
continued
this
through
the
whole
fight
the
commander
lieut
cassin
fought
his
schooner
most
nobly
he
kept
walking
the
taffrail
amidst
showers
of
musketry
and
grape
coolly
watching
the
movements
of
the
galleys
and
directing
the
guns
to
be
loaded
with
canister
and
bags
of
bullets
when
the
enemy
tried
to
board
the
british
galleys
were
handled
with
determined
gallantry
under
the
command
of
lieutenant
bell
had
they
driven
off
the
they
would
have
won
the
day
for
their
side
and
they
pushed
up
till
they
were
not
a
length
distant
to
try
to
carry
her
by
boarding
but
every
attempt
was
repulsed
and
they
were
forced
to
draw
off
some
of
them
so
crippled
by
the
slaughter
they
had
suffered
that
they
could
hardly
man
the
oars
meanwhile
the
fighting
at
the
head
of
the
line
had
been
even
fiercer
the
first
broadside
of
the
fired
from
long
double
shotted
coolly
sighted
in
smooth
water
at
range
produced
the
most
terrible
effect
on
the
her
hull
shivered
all
over
with
the
shock
and
when
the
crash
subsided
nearly
half
of
her
people
were
seen
stretched
on
deck
for
many
had
been
knocked
down
who
were
not
seriously
hurt
among
the
slain
was
her
first
lieutenant
peter
gamble
he
was
kneeling
down
to
sight
the
when
a
shot
entered
the
port
split
the
quoin
and
drove
a
portion
of
it
against
his
side
killing
him
without
breaking
the
skin
the
survivors
carried
on
the
fight
with
undiminished
energy
macdonough
himself
worked
like
a
common
sailor
in
pointing
and
handling
a
favorite
gun
while
bending
over
to
sight
it
a
round
shot
cut
in
two
the
spanker
boom
which
fell
on
his
head
and
struck
him
senseless
for
two
or
three
minutes
he
then
leaped
to
his
feet
and
continued
as
before
when
a
shot
took
off
the
head
of
the
captain
of
the
gun
and
drove
it
in
his
face
with
such
a
force
as
to
knock
him
to
the
other
side
of
the
deck
but
after
the
first
broadside
not
so
much
injury
was
done
the
guns
of
the
had
been
levelled
to
range
and
as
the
quoins
were
loosened
by
the
successive
discharges
they
were
not
properly
replaced
so
that
her
broadsides
kept
going
higher
and
higher
and
doing
less
and
less
damage
very
shortly
after
the
beginning
of
the
action
her
gallant
captain
was
slain
he
was
standing
behind
one
of
the
long
guns
when
a
shot
from
the
struck
it
and
threw
it
completely
off
the
carriage
against
his
right
groin
killing
him
almost
instantly
his
skin
was
not
broken
a
black
mark
about
the
size
of
a
small
plate
was
the
only
visible
injury
his
watch
was
found
flattened
with
its
hands
pointing
to
the
very
second
at
which
he
received
the
fatal
blow
as
the
contest
went
on
the
fire
gradually
decreased
in
weight
the
guns
being
disabled
the
inexperience
of
both
crews
partly
caused
this
the
american
sailors
overloaded
their
carronades
so
as
to
very
much
destroy
the
effect
of
their
fire
when
the
officers
became
disabled
the
men
would
cram
the
guns
with
shot
till
the
last
projected
from
the
muzzle
of
course
this
lessened
the
execution
and
also
gradually
crippled
the
guns
on
board
the
the
confusion
was
even
worse
after
the
battle
the
charges
of
the
guns
were
drawn
and
on
the
side
she
had
fought
one
was
found
with
a
canvas
bag
containing
two
round
of
shot
rammed
home
and
wadded
without
any
powder

with
two
cartridges
and
no
shot
and
a
third
with
a
wad
below

cartridge

the
extreme
head
of
the
line

advantage

been

a
long
time

the

sides
behaved

bravery

left
nothing
to
be
desired
in
this
respect
but
from
their
rawness
they
of

showed
far
less
skill
than
the

macdonough
in

battle
won
a
higher
fame
than
any
other
commander

had
a
decidedly
superior
force
to
contend
against
the
officers

of
the
two
sides
being
about
on
a
par
in
every
respect
and
it
was
solely
owing
to
his
foresight
and
resource
that
we
won
the
victory
he
forced
the
british
to
engage
at
a
disadvantage
by
his
excellent
choice
of
position
and
he
prepared
beforehand
for
every
possible
contingency
his
personal
prowess
had
already
been
shown
at
the
cost
of
the
rovers
of
tripoli
and
in
this
action
he
helped
fight

as
ably
as

as
can
been
seen
almost
every
sentence
of
this
account
is
taken
very
nearly
word
for
word
from
the
various
official
reports
relying
especially
on
the
log
of
the
british
frigate
i
have
been
thus
careful
to
have
every
point
of
the
narrative
established
by
unimpeachable
reference
first
because
there
have
been
quite
a
number
of
british
historians
who
have
treated
the
conflict
as
if
it
were
a
victory
and
not
a
defeat
for
the
and
in
the
second
place
because
i
regret
to
say
that
i
do
not
think
that
the
facts
bear
out
the
assertions
on
the
part
of
most
american
authors
that
commodore
decatur
covered
himself
with
glory
and
showed
the
utmost
heroism
as
regards
the
first
point
captain
hope
himself
in
his
singularly
short
official
letter
does
little
beyond
detail
his
own
loss
and
makes
no
claim
to
having
vanquished
his
opponent
almost
all
the
talk
about
its
being
a
victory
comes
from
james
and
in
recounting
this
as
well
as
all
the
other
battles
nearly
every
subsequent
british
historian
simply
gives
james
statements
over
again
occasionally
amplifying
but
more
often
altering
or
omitting
the
vituperation
the
point
at
issue
is
simply
this
could
a
frigate
which
according
to
james
himself
went
out
of
action
with
every
sail
set
take
another
frigate
which
for
two
hours
according
to
the
log
of
the
lay
motionless
and
unmanageable
on
the
waters
without
a
sail
to
prove
that
it
could
not
of
course
needs
some
not
manipulation
of
the
facts
the
intention
with
which
james
sets
about
his
work
can
be
gathered
from
the
triumphant
conclusion
he
comes
to
that
decatur
name
has
been
sunk
quite
as
low
as
that
of
bainbridge
or
porter
which
comparing
small
things
to
great
is
somewhat
like
saying
that
napoleon
defeat
by
wellington
and
blucher
sunk
him
to
the
level
of
hannibal
for
the
account
of
the
american
crew
and
loss
james
relies
on
the
statements
made
in
the
bermuda
papers
of
whose
subsequent
forced
retraction
he
takes
no
notice
and
of
course
largely
overestimates
both
on
the
same
authority
he
states
that
the
fire
was
silenced
commodore
decatur
stating
the
exact
reverse
the
point
is
fortunately
settled
by
the
log
of
the
which
distinctly
says
that
the
last
shot
was
fired
by
the
his
last
resort
is
to
state
that
the
loss
of
the
was
fourfold
in
reality
threefold
that
of
the
now
we
have
seen
that
the
lost
a
considerable
number
of
men
from
the
fire
of
the
estimating
these
at
only
nineteen
we
have
a
loss
of
sixty
caused
by
the
and
as
most
of
this
was
caused
during
the
first
half
hour
when
the
was
not
firing
it
follows
that
while
the
two
vessels
were
both
fighting
broadside
and
broadside
the
loss
inflicted
was
about
equal
or
the
aiming
at
her
adversary
rigging
succeeded
in
completely
disabling
her

of

the
slaughter
ought
to
have
been

greater

when
the

aloft
only
killed
about
the
same
number
of
men
had
there
been
no
other
vessels
in
chase
commodore
decatur
his
adversary
having
been
thus
rendered
perfectly
helpless
could
have
simply
taken
any
position
he
chose
and
compelled
the
latter
to
strike
without
suffering
any
material
additional
loss
himself
as
in
such
a
case
he
would
neither
have
endured
the
unanswered
fire
of
the
on
his
quarter
for
the
first
half
hour
nor
the
subsequent
broadsides
of
the
the
loss
would
probably
have
been
no
greater
than
that
of
the
in
taking
the
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
any
outsider
with
an
ounce
of
and
fairmindedness
can
help
awarding
the
palm
to
decatur
as
regards
the
action
with
the
but
i
regret
to
say
that
i
must
agree
with
james
that
he
acted
rather
tamely
certainly
not
heroically
in
striking
to
the
there
was
of
course
not
much
chance
of
success
in
doing
battle
with
two
fresh
frigates
but
then
they
only
mounted
and
judging
from
the
slight
results
of
the
cannonading
from
the
and
the
two
first
usually
the
most
fatal
broadsides
of
the
it
would
have
been
rather
a
long
time
before
they
would
have
caused
much
damage
meanwhile
the
was
pretty
nearly
as
well
off
as
ever
as
far
as
fighting
and
sailing
went
a
lucky
shot
might
have
disabled
one
of
her
opponents
and
then
the
other
would
in
all
probability
have
undergone
the
same
fate
as
the
at
least
it
was
well
worth
trying
and
though
decatur
could
not
be
said
to
be
disgraced
yet
it
is
excusable
to
wish
that
porter
or
perry
had
been
in
his
place
it
is
not
very
pleasant
to
criticise
the
actions
of
an
american
whose
name
is
better
known
than
that
of
almost
any
other
captain
of
his
time
but
if
a
man
is
as
much
to
be
praised
for
doing
fairly
or
even
badly
as
for
doing
excellently
then
there
is
no
use
in
bestowing
praise
at
all
this
is
perhaps
as
good
a
place
as
any
other
to
notice
one
or
two
of
james
most
common
misstatements
they
really
would
not
need
refutation
were
it
not
that
they
have
been
reechoed
as
usual
by
almost
every
british
historian
of
the
war
for
the
last
years
in
the
first
place
james
puts
the
number
of
the
men
at
she
had
an
exactly
parallel
reduction
must
often
be
made
when
he
speaks
of
the
force
of
an
american
ship
then
he
says
there
were
many
british
among
them
which
is
denied
under
oath
by
the
american
officers
this
holds
good
also
for
the
other
american
frigates
he
says
there
were
but
boys
there
were
nearly
and
on
he
says
the
youngest
was
whereas
we
incidentally
learn
from
the
life
of
decatur
that
several
were
under
a
favorite
accusation
is
that
the
american
midshipmen
were
chiefly
masters
and
mates
of
but
this
was
hardly
ever
the
case
many
of
the
midshipmen
of
the
war
afterward
became
celebrated
commanders
and
most
of
these
a
notable
instance
being
farragut
the
greatest
admiral
since
nelson
were
entirely
too
young
in
to
have
had
vessels
under
them
and
moreover
came
largely
from
the
best
families
again
in
the
first
two
frigate
actions
of
the
proportion
of
killed
to
wounded
happened
to
be
unusually
large
on
board
the
american
frigates
accordingly
james
states
that
the
returns
of
the
wounded
had
been
garbled
and
made
subservient
to
the
views
of
the
commanders
and
their
government
to
support
his
position
that
capt
hull
who
reported
killed
and
wounded
had
not
given
the
list
of
the
latter
in
full
he
says
that
an
equal
number
of
killed
and
wounded
as
given
in
the
american
account
hardly
ever
occurs
except
in
cases
of
explosion
and
yet
on
he
gives
the
loss
of
the
british
as
killed
and
wounded
disregarding
the
incongruity
involved
on
in
noticing
the
loss
of
the
killed
and
wounded
he
says
that
the
slightly
wounded
as
in
all
other
american
cases
are
omitted
this
is
untrue
and
the
proportion
on
the
to
is
just
about
the
same
as
that
given
by
james
himself
on
the
to
and
to
in
supporting
his
theory
james
brings
up
all
the
instances
where
the
american
wounded
bore
a
larger
proportion
to
their
dead
than
on
board
the
british
ships
but
passes
over
the
actions
with
the
and
where
the
reverse
was
the
case
one
of
most
common
methods
of
attempting
to
throw
discredit
on
the
much
vilified
yankees
is
by
quoting
newspaper
accounts
of
their
wounded
thus
he
says
of
the
that
several
of
her
men
told
some
of
the
sailors
that
she
lost
men
killed
wounded
etc
utterly
false
rumors
of
this
kind
were
as
often
indulged
in
by
the
americans
as
the
british
after
the
capture
of
the
articles
occasionally
appeared
in
the
papers
to
the
effect
that
some
american
sailor
had
counted
dead
on
board
the
that
more
than
of
her
men
were
wounded
etc
such
statements
were
as
commonly
made
and
with
as
little
foundation
by
one
side
as
by
the
other
and
it
is
absurd
for
a
historian
to
take
any
notice
of
them
james
does
no
worse
than
many
of
our
own
writers
of
the
same
date
but
while
their
writings
have
passed
into
oblivion
his
work
is
still
often
accepted
as
a
standard
this
must
be
my
apology
for
devoting
so
much
time
to
it
the
severest
criticism
to
which
it
can
possibly
be
subjected
is
to
compare
it
with
the
truth
whenever
dealing
with
purely
american
affairs
james
history
is
as
utterly
untrustworthy
as
its
contemporary

is
in

purely
british

speak
of

otherwise
undertaken
by
british
boats
against
american
privateers
and
twice
a
small
british
national
cutter
was
captured
by
an
overwhelmingly
superior
american
opponent
of
this
class
we
now
for
the
only
time
come
across
an
engagement
between
a
privateer
and
a
regular
cruiser
of
approximately
equal
force
these
privateers
came
from
many
different
ports
and
varied
greatly
in
size
baltimore
produced
the
largest
number
but
new
york
philadelphia
boston
and
salem
were
not
far
behind
and
charleston
bristol
and
plymouth
supplied
some
that
were
very
famous
many
were
merely
small
with
a
crew
of
to
men
intended
only
to
harry
the
west
indian
trade
others
were
large
powerful
craft
unequalled
for
speed
by
any
vessels
of
their
size
which
penetrated
to
the
remotest
corners
of
the
ocean
from
man
to
the
spice
islands
when
a
privateer
started
she
was
overloaded
with
men
to
enable
her
to
man
her
prizes
a
successful
cruise
would
reduce
her
crew
to
a
fifth
of
its
original
size
the
favorite
rig
was
that
of
a
schooner
but
there
were
many
brigs
and
brigantines
each
was
generally
armed
with
a
long
or
on
a
pivot
and
a
number
of
light
guns
in
broadside
either
long
or
short
or
some
had
no
pivot
gun
others
had
nothing
else
the
largest
of
them
carried
guns
a
pivotal
and
long
in
broadside
with
a
crew
of
such
a
vessel
ought
to
have
been
a
match
at
her
own
distance
for
a
british
but
we
never
hear
of
any
such
engagements
and
there
were
several
instances
where
privateers
gave
up
without
firing
a
shot
to
a
force
superior
it
is
true
but
not
enough
so
to
justify
the
absolute
tameness
of
the
surrender
footnote
as
when
the
some
little
time
before
her
own
capture
took
without
resistance
the
of
salem
mounting
long
nines
and
having
men
aboard
one
explanation
of
this
was
that
they
were
cruising
as
private
ventures
and
their
object
was
purely
to
capture
with
as
little
risk
as
possible
to
themselves
another
reason
was
that
they
formed
a
kind
of
and
like
their
compeers
on
land
some
fight
as
well
as
any
regulars
while
most
would
fight
at
all
especially
if
there
was
need
of
concerted
action
between
two
or
three
the
american
papers
of
the
day
are
full
of
glorious
victories
gained
by
privateers
over
packets
and
indiamen
the
british
papers
are
almost
as
full
of
instances
where
the
packets
and
indiamen
heroically
repulsed
the
privateers
as
neither
side
ever
chronicles
a
defeat
and
as
the
narration
is
apt
to
be
decidedly
figurative
in
character
there
is
very
little
hope
of
getting
at
the
truth
of
such
meetings
so
i
have
confined
myself
to
the
mention
of
those
cases
where
privateers
of
either
side
came
into
armed
collision
with
regular
cruisers
we
are
then
sure
to
find
some
authentic
account
the
privateer
brig
of
baltimore
captain
thomas
boyle
carried
long
and
had
when
she
left

men
aboard
she
made
prizes

her
last
voyage

her
crew
was
thus
reduced
to
less
than
men
she
was
then
chased
by
the
frigate
and
threw
overboard

her

eight
carronades
were
taken
from
a
prize
to
partially
supply
the
places
of
the
lost
guns

as
she
had
no
shot
of
the
calibre
of
these
carronades
each
of
the
latter
was
loaded

reflected
the
greatest
credit
on

and
also
on
her
adversaries
footnote
there
is
no
british
official
account
of
the
action
james
states
that
the
entire
british
force
was
only
men
of
whom
were
killed
and
wounded
this
is
probably
not
based
on
any
authority
captain
stewart
received
on
board
prisoners
of
whom
were
wounded
several
mortally
curiously
enough
james
also
underestimates
the
american
loss
making
it
only
he
also
says
that
many
attempts
were
made
by
the
americans
to
induce
the
captured
british
to
desert
while
the
officers
deny
this
under
oath
before
justice
welsh
as
already
quoted
and
state
that
on
the
contrary
many
of
the
prisoners
offered
to
enlist
on
the
frigate
but
were
all
refused
permission
as
the
loss
of
the
had
taught
us
the
danger
of
having
renegades
aboard
this
denial
by
the
way
holds
good
for
all
the
similar
statements
made
by
james
as
regards
the
etc
he
also
states
that
a
british
found
various
counts
against
the
americans
for
harsh
treatment
but
all
of
these
were
specifically
denied
by
the

officers

on

narratives
but
partly
as
to
time

on
the
british
account
in
the
naval
chronicle
the
merits
of
this
action
can
perhaps
be
better
appreciated
by
comparing
it
with
a
similar
one
that
took
place
a
few
years
before
between
a
british
sloop
and
corvette
on
the
one
side
and
a
french
frigate
on
the
other

in

authors
differ
somewhat
in
the
account
of

came
in

starboard
side
the
american
seamen
had
been
called
away
and
were
at
their
posts
to
repel
boarders
but
as
the
british
made
no
attempt
to
come
on
the
cutlass
men
began
to
clamber
into
the
rigging
to
go
aboard
the
brig
captain
biddle
very
coolly
stopped
them
it
being
evident
from
the
beginning
that
our
fire
was
greatly
superior
both
in
quickness
and
effect
there
was
a
heavy
sea
running

as
the
forged
ahead
the
bowsprit
carried
away
her
mizzen
shrouds

davits
and

the
brig
then
hung
on
her
starboard
quarter
where
only
small
arms
could
be
used
on
either
side
an
english
officer
now
called
out
something
which
biddle
understood
whether
correctly
or
not
is
disputed
to
be
the
word
of
surrender
accordingly
he
directed
his
marines
to
cease
firing
and
jumped
on
the
taffrail
at
that
minute
two
of
the
marines
on
the
forecastle
not

distant
fired
at

one
of

a
rather
severe

off

broadside

condition
prevented

absent
in
a
prize
by
actual
measurement
she
was
two
feet
longer

slightly
narrower

loss
was
chiefly
caused
by
musketry

wounded

or
spar
materially
injured
but
the
rigging
and
sails
were
a
good
deal
cut
especially
about
the
fore
and
main
masts
the
crew
had
been
suffering
much
from
sickness
and
of
the
men
were
unable
to
be
at
quarters
thus
reducing
the
vessels
to
an
exact
equality
counting
in
these
men

excluding

footnote
this
number
of
men
is
probably
too
great
i
have
not
personally
examined
the
for
that
period
lieutenant
emmons
in
his
history
gives
her
men
but
perhaps
he
did
not
include
the
nine
sick
which
would
make
his
statement
about
the
same
as
mine
in
response
to
my
inquiries
i
received
a
very
kind
letter
from
the
treasury

office
which
stated
that
the
of
the
on
this
voyage
showed
officers

crew
marines
excepted
adding
the
marines
would
make
but
in
all
i
think
there
must
be
some
mistake
in
this
and
so
have
considered
the
crew
as
consisting
originally
of
men
the
same
as
on
her
cruises
in
the
was
in
reality
slightly
larger
than
the
judging
from
the
comparisons
made
in
biddle

for
the
original
of

see
in
the
naval
archives

says
that
the

two
feet
shorter

a
greater
length

a
slightly
greater
breadth
of
beam
stouter
sides
and
higher
bulwarks
with
swivels
on
the
capstan
and
tops
and
that
she
fought
both
her
long
on
the
same
side
i
have
followed
james
however
as
regards
this
he
says
her
long
guns
were
and
that
but
one
was
fought
on
a
side
or
the
force
being
practically
equal
the
inflicted
fourfold
the
loss
and
tenfold
the
damage
she
suffered
hardly
any
action
of
the
war
reflected
greater
credit
on
the
united
states
marine
than
this
for
the
cool
skilful
seamanship
and
excellent
gunnery
that
enabled
the
americans
to
destroy
an
antagonist
of
equal
force
in
such
an
exceedingly
short
time
the
british
displayed
equal
bravery
but
were
certainly
very
much
behind
their
antagonists
in
the
other
qualities
which
go
to
make
up
a
even
james
says
he
can
not
offer
the
trifling
disparity
of
force
in
this
action
as
an
excuse
for
the
capture
the
chief
cause
is
the
immense
disparity
between
the
two
vessels
in
the
effectiveness
of
their
crews
footnote
after
the
action

of
the

of
the
defeated
british
commanders
were
published
after
as
regards
this
action
every
british
writer
has
followed
james
who
begins
his
account
thus
had
the
vessel
in
sight
to
windward
been
rigged
with
three
masts
instead
of
two

had
she
proved
to
be

have
marked
her
down

log

a

have
made
off
with
all
the
canvas
he
could
possibly
spread

the
ship
overtaken
the

been
in

a
trifle
superior
in
force
captain
biddle
we
have
no
doubt
would
have
exhausted
his
eloquence
in
lauding
the
blessings
of
peace
before
he
tried
a
struggle
for
the
honors
of

this
preface
which
should
be
read
in
connection
with
the
unaccepted
challenge
to

ship
a
trifle
superior
in
force
it
can
be
considered
certain
that
james
will
both
extenuate
and
also
set
down
a
good
deal
in
malice
one
instance
of
this
has
already
been
given
in
speaking
of
the
capture
again
he
says
the
received
several
round
shot

she
did

perfectly
well
that
not

the
shot
hit
the

the
quotations
i
have
given
are
quite
enough
to
prove
that
nothing
he
says
about
the
action
is
worth
attending
to
the
funniest
part
of
his
account
is
where
he
makes
captain
biddle
get
drunk
lose
his
native
cunning
and
corroborate
his
james
statements
he
does
not
even

those

it
is
perhaps
worth
noting
that
the
accounts
incidentally
mention
the
fact
that
almost
the
entire

consisted
of
native
americans
of
whom
a
number
had
served

impressed
seamen

these
threefold
and

down
as

were
rewarded

shift
in
the
wind
had
been
very
much
against
them
but
now
it
veered
back
again
so
as
to
bring
them
to
windward

every
minute
as
it
blew
fresher
and
fresher
their
chances
increased
by
dark
the

well
astern

during

night
the

kept
freshening
blowing

just
suited

on

no

which
she
reached

this
chase
requires
almost
the
same
comments
as
the
last
chase
of
the
in
both
cases
the
american
captains
and
their
crews
deserve
the
very
highest
praise
for
plucky

seamanship

exactly
as
coolness

promptitude
might
not

the
had
it

in
spite

stubbornness

resource
if

i
regret
to
say
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
he
acted
with

humanity
it
seems
impossible
that

when

it
is
well
to
remember
that
a

affords
a

the
value
to
be
attached
to
his
figures
and
tables

british
loss
he
gives
at
but

he
omits
the

burnt
by

although
including
the
frigate
and

burnt
by

at

if
the

the

should
be

would

they
had
been

out

bur
he
includes
those
of

had
been

the

way
he
omits
all
reference
to
the
british
schooner
burnt
on

to
all
and
sloops
and

captured
there
although
including
the
corresponding
american
vessels
the
reason
that
he
so
much
underestimates
the
tonnage
especially
on
the
lakes
i
have
elsewhere
discussed
his
tables
of
the
relative
loss
in
men
are
even
more
erroneous
exaggerating
that
of
the
americans
and
greatly
underestimating
that
of
the
british
but
i
have
not
tabulated
this
on
account
of
the
impossibility
of
getting
fair
estimates
of
the
killed
and
wounded
in
the
expeditions
and
the
difficulty
of
enumerating
the
prisoners
taken
in
descents
etc
roughly
about
americans
and
british
were
captured
the
comparative
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
stood
much
more
in
our
favor
i
have
excluded
from
the
british
loss
the
brigs
and
and
schooner
aggregating
guns
and
about
tons
destroyed
on
the
upper
lakes
because
i
hardly
know
whether
they
could
be
considered
national
vessels
the
schooner
of
guns
men
and
tons
taken
by
rodgers
because
she
seems
to
have
been
merely
a
tender
and
the
of
men
and
tons
because
her
captor
the
privateer
though
nominally
an
american
was
really
a
french
vessel
of
course
both
tables
are
only
approximately
exact
but
at
any
rate
the
balance
of
damage
and
loss
was
over
to
in
our
favor
but
the
loss
of
the
and
can
fairly
be
considered
to
be
counterbalanced
by
the
capture
or
destruction
of
the
various
british
royal
packets
all
armed
with
from
to
guns
tenders
barges
which
would
be
in
the
aggregate
of
at
least
as
great
tonnage
and
gun
force
and
with
more
numerous
crews
but
the
comparative
material
loss
gives
no
idea
of
the
comparative
honor
gained
the
british
navy
numbering
at
the
onset
a
thousand
cruisers
had
accomplished
less
than
the
american
which
numbered
but
a
dozen
moreover
most
of
the
loss
suffered
by
the
former
was
in
single
fight
while
this
had
been
but
twice
the
case
with
the
americans
who
had
generally
been
overwhelmed
by
numbers
the
and
were
both
captured
by
more
than
double
their
force
simply
because
they
were
disabled
before
the
fight
began
otherwise
they
would
certainly
have
escaped
with
the
exceptions
of
the
and
both
of
which
were
taken
fairly
because
their
antagonists
though
of
only
equal
force
were
better
fighters
the
remaining
loss
of
the
americans
was
due
to
the
small
cruisers
stumbling
from
time
to
time
across
the
path
of
some
one
of
the
innumerable
british
heavy
vessels
had
congressional
forethought
been
sufficiently
great
to
have
allowed
a
few
ships
to
have
been
in
readiness
some
time
previous
to
the
war
results
of
weight
might
have
been
accomplished

the
only
activity
ever
exhibited
by
congress
in
materially
increasing
the
navy

of

nearly
even

in

the
superiority
of
the
americans
was
very
manifest
in
three
actions
those
with
the
and
the
combatants
were
about
equal
in
strength
the
americans
having
slightly
the
advantage
in
all

others

two

combined
superiority
of
force
with
superiority
of
skill

two
cases
those
of

could
any
lack
of
courage
be
imputed
to
the
vanquished
the
second
year
alone
showed
to
the
advantage
of
the
british
the
various
encounters
otherwise
were
as
creditable
to
the
americans
at
the
end
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
this
is
worth
attending
to
because
many
authors
speak
as
if
the
successes
of
the
americans
were
confined
to
the
first
year
it
is
true
that
no
frigate
was
taken
after
the
first
year
but
this
was
partly
because
the
strictness
of
the
blockade
kept
the
american
frigates
more
in
port
while
the
sloops
put
out
to
sea
at
pleasure
and
partly
because
after
that
year
the
british
frigates
either
cruised
in
couples
or
when
single
invariably
refused
by
order
of
the
board
of
admiralty
an
encounter
with
a
and
though
much
of
the
american
success
was
unquestionably
to
be
attributed
to
more
men
and
heavier
guns
yet
much
of
it
was
not
the
war
itself
gives
us
two
instances
in
which
defeat
was
owing
solely
it
may
be
said
to
inferiority
of
force
courage
and
skill
being
equal
the
was
far
heavier
than
the
and
there
being
nothing
to
choose
between
them
in
any
thing
else
the
damage
done
was
about
proportionate
to
this
difference
it
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
very
much
greater
disproportion
in
loss
in
the
cases
of
the
where
the
disproportion
in
force
was
much
less
they
mounting
instead
of
and
the
victors
being
all
of
the
same
class
is
only
to
be
explained
by
the
inferiority
in
skill
on
the
part
of
the
vanquished

remarks
apply
just

ease

the

only
effect
of

honestly
believe
that
the

offered
rather
better
material
for

the

institutions

country
as
compared
with
the
britain
of
the
drunken
prince
regent
and
his
dotard
father
a
very
different
land
from
the
present
free
england
and
the
peculiar
exigencies
of
his
life
tended
to
make
him
more
intelligent
and
but
the
difference
when
there
was
any
was
very
small
and
disappeared
entirely
when
his
opponents
had
been
drilled
for
any
length
of
time
by
men
like
broke
or
manners
the
advantage
consisted
in
the
fact
that
our
commander
was
equal
to
the
best
and
higher
than
the
average
of
the
opposing
captains
and
this
held
good
throughout
the
various
grades
of
the
officers
the
american
officers
knew
they
had
redoubtable
foes
to
contend
with
and
made
every
preparation
accordingly
owing
their
rank
to
their
own
exertions
trained
by
practical
experience

with
large
liberty
of
action

most
of

the

had
a
dual
aspect
it
was
partly
a
contest
between
the
two

race

partly
a
last
attempt
on

part
of

of

attracting
comparatively
little
attention
was
really
much
the
most

its
effect
upon

for

doing
all
they
could
to
put
off
the

when
their
race
would
reach
to
a
worldwide
supremacy
there
was
much
fighting
along
our
western
frontier
with
various
indian
tribes
and
it
was
especially
fierce
in
the
campaign
that
a
backwoods
general
of
tennessee
named
andrew
jackson
carried
on
against
the
powerful
confederacy
of
the

a
nation
that
was
thrust

most

being

marched

who
have
uniformly
received
them

i
really
believe
that

outrages
have
been
committed
by
this
army
than
by
any
other

ever
was

nameless
woe
that
awaited
their

point
they
feared
not

in

hearts

lurked
a
dull
terror
of
what
that

bring

that
these
fears
were

all

glinted

place
during
the
entire
struggle
and
the
fact
that
we
were
victorious
not
only
saved
our
at
home
but
also
gave
us
prestige
abroad
which
we
should
otherwise
have
totally
lacked
it
could
not
be
said
to
entirely
balance
the
numerous
defeats
that
we
had
elsewhere
suffered
on
land
defeats
which
had
so
far
only
been
offset
by
harrison
victory
in
and
the
campaign
in
lower
canada
in
but
it
at
any
rate
went
a
long
way
toward
making
the
score
even
jackson
is
certainly
by
all
odds
the
most
prominent
figure
that
appeared
during
this
war
and
stands
head
and
shoulders
above
any
other
commander
american
or
british
that
it
produced
it
will
be
difficult
in
all
history
to
show
a
parallel
to
the
feat
that
he
performed
in
three
weeks
fighting
with
a
force
largely
composed
of
militia
he
utterly
defeated
and
drove
away
an
army
twice
the
size
of
his
own
composed
of
veteran
troops
and
led
by
one
of
the
ablest
of
european
generals
during
the
whole
campaign
he
only
erred
once
and
that
was
in
putting
general
morgan
a
very
incompetent
officer
in
command
of
the
forces
on
the
west
bank
he
suited
his
movements
admirably
to
the
various
exigencies
that
arose
the
promptness
and
skill
with
which
he
attacked
as
soon
as
he
knew
of
the
near
approach
of
the
british
undoubtedly
saved
the
city
for
their
vanguard
was
so
roughly
handled
that
instead
of
being
able
to
advance
at
once
they
were
forced
to
delay
three
days
during
which
time
jackson
entrenched
himself
in
a
position
from
which
he
was
never
driven
but
after
this
attack
the
offensive
would
have
been
not
only
hazardous
but
useless
and
accordingly
jackson
adopting
the
mode
of
warfare
which
best
suited
the
ground
he
was
on
and
the
troops
he
had
under
him
forced
the
enemy
always
to
fight
him
where
he
was
strongest
and
confined
himself
strictly
to
the
pure
defensive
a
system
condemned
by
most
european
authorities

which

at
times
succeeded

it
must
be

that

either
to

to
the
errors
of

the

has
been
stated
again

again
with
very
great
injustice
not
only
by
british
but
even
by
american
writers
as
sumner
in
his
andrew

as
a
public

boston
the
climax
of
absurdity
is
reached
by
major
mcdougal
who
says
as
quoted
by
cole
in
his
memoirs
of
british
generals
ii
sir
edward
packenham
fell
not
after
an
utter
and
disastrous
defeat
but
at
the
very
moment
when
the
arms
of
victory
were
extended
towards
him
and
by
james
who
says
ii
the
premature
fall
of
a
british
general
saved
an
american
city
these
assertions
are
just
on
a
par
with
those
made
by
american
writers
that
only
the
fall
of
lawrence
prevented
the
from
capturing
the
british
writers
have
always
attributed
the
defeat
largely
to
the
fact
that
the
regiment
which
was
to
have
led
the
attack
with
fascines
and
ladders
did
not
act
well
i
doubt
if
this
had
any
effect
on
the
result
some
few
of
the
men
with
ladders
did
reach
the
ditch
but
were
shot
down
at
once
and
their
fate
would
have
been
shared
by
any
others
who
had
been
with
them
the
bulk
of
the
column
was
never
able
to
advance
through
the
fire
up
to
the
breastwork
and
all
the
ladders
and
fascines
in
christendom
would
not
have
helped
it
there
will
always
be
innumerable
excuses
offered
for
any
defeat
but
on
this
occasion
the
truth
is
simply
that
the
british
regulars
found
they
could
not
advance
in
the
open
against
a
fire
more
deadly
than
they
had
ever
before
encountered
as
far
as
fortune
favored
either
side
it
was
that
of
the
british
footnote
the
unexpected
frost
made
the
swamps
firm
for
them
to
advance
through
the
river
being
so
low
when
the
levee
was
cut
the
bayous
were
filled
instead
of
the
british

drowned
out
the
carolina

only
blown
up
because
the

and
packenham
left
nothing
undone
to
accomplish
his
aim
and
made
no
movements
that
his
experience
in
european
war
did
not
justify
his
making
there
is
not
the
slightest
reason
for
supposing
that
any
other
british

would
have
accomplished
more

they
showed
in

at
the

end
they
were

all
showed
that
their
soldierly
qualities
were
of
the
highest
order
as
much
can
not
be

of
the
british
artillery
which
though
very
bravely
fought
was
clearly
by
no

as
skilfully
handled
as
was
the
case
with
the
american

the
courage
of
the
british

mournfully
attested

the
sadly
large
proportion
they
bore
to
the
total

the
lists

an
even
greater
meed
of
praise
is
due
to
the
american

for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
they
were
raw
troops
opposed
to
veterans
and
indeed
nothing
but
jackson
tireless
care
in
drilling
them
could
have
brought
them
into
shape
at

just
as
good
as
the
british

no
better
the
kentucky
militia
who
had
only
been

with

were
badly

the
tennesseeans

start
with

already
well
trained

under

were
in
their
own
way
unsurpassable
as
soldiers
in
the
open

the
british
regulars
owing
to
their
greater
skill
in
manoeuvring
and
to
their
having
bayonets
with
which
the
tennesseeans
were
unprovided
could
in
all
likelihood
have
beaten
them
but
in
rough
or
broken
ground
the
skill
of
the
tennesseeans
both
as
marksmen
and
woodsmen
would
probably
have
given
them
the
advantage
while
the
extreme
deadliness
of
their
fire
made
it
far
more
dangerous
to
attempt
to
storm
a

the

great
credit
for
doing
so
well

greater
credit
still
belongs
to
andrew

was
thus
estimated
in
a
purely
arbitrary
manner
with
no
regard
to
actual
capacity
or
displacement
and
moreover
what
is
of
more
importance
the
british
method
differed
from
the
american
so
much
that
a
ship
measured
in
the
latter
way
would
be
nominally
about
per
cent
larger
than
if
measured
by
british
rules
this
is
the
exact
reverse
of
the
statement
made
by
the
british
naval
historian
james
his
mistake
is
pardonable
for
great
confusion
existed
on
the
subject
at
that
time
even
the
officers
not
knowing
the
tonnage
of
their
own
ships
when
the
was
captured
her
officers
stated
that
she
measured
about
tons
in
reality
she
tonned
american
measure
still
more
singular
was
the
testimony
of
the
officers
of
the
who
thought
her
to
be
of
about
tons
while
she
was
of
by
american
or
by
british
measurement
these
errors
were
the
more
excusable
as
they
occurred
also
in
higher
quarters
the
earliest
notice
we
have
about
the
three
frigates
of
the
class
is
in
the
letter
of
secretary
of
the
navy
benjamin
stoddart
on
footnote
american
state
papers
xiv
where
they
are
expressly
said
to
be
of
tons
and
this
tonnage
is
given
them
in
every
navy
list
that
mentions
it
for
years
afterward
yet
secretary
paul
hamilton
in
one
of
his
letters
incidentally
alludes
to
them
as
of
tons
later
i
think
about
the
year
the
method
of
measuring
was
changed
and
their
tonnage
was
put
down
as
james
takes
the
american
tonnage
from
secretary
hamilton
letter
as
and
states
vol
vi
that
this
is
equivalent
to
tons
english
but
in
reality
by
american
measurement
the
tonnage
was
so
that
even
according
to
james
own
figures
the
british
way
of
measurement
made
the
frigate
tons
smaller
than
the
american
way
did
actually
the
difference
was
nearer
tons
james
statements
as
to
the
size
of
our
various
ships
would
seem
to
have
been
largely
mere
guesswork
as
he
sometimes
makes
them
smaller
and
sometimes
larger
than
they
were
according
to
the
official
navy
lists
thus
the
and
each
of
he
puts
down
as
of
the
of
as
of
the
of
as
of
and
the
of
as
of
tons
on
the
other
hand
the
of
tons
he
states
to
be
of
the
of
he
considers
to
be
of
and
the
of
each
as
of
he
thus
certainly
adopts
different
standards
of
measurement
not
only
for
the
american
as
distinguished
from
the
british
vessels
but
even
among
the
various
american
vessels
themselves
and
there
are
other
difficulties
to
be
encountered
not
only
were
there
different
ways
of
casting
tonnage
from
given
measurements
but
also
there
were
different
ways
of
getting
what
purported
to
be
the
same
measurement
a
ship
that
according
to
the
british
method
of
measurement
was
of
a
certain
length
would
according
to
the
american
method
be
about
per
cent
longer
and
so
if
two
vessels
were
the
same
size
the
american
would
have
the
greatest
nominal
tonnage
for
example
james
in
his
naval
occurrences
gives
the
length
of
the
main
deck
as
feet
inches
this
same
was
carefully
surveyed
and
measured
under
orders
from
the
united
states
navy
department
by
lieut
hoffman
and
in
his
published
report
footnote
american
state
papers
xiv
p
he
gives
among
the
other
dimensions
length
of
feet
inches
and
length
of
feet
inches
with
such
a
difference
in
the
way
of
taking
measurements
as
well
as
of
computing
tonnage
from
the
measurements
when
taken
it
is
not
surprising
that
according
to
the
american
method
the
should
have
ranked
as
of
about
tons
instead
of
as
james
takes
no
account
of
any
of
these
differences
i
hardly
know
how
to
treat
his
statements
of
comparative
tonnage
thus
he
makes
the
tons
and
the
and
which
she
at
different
times
captured
about
each
as
it
happens
both
captain
lawrence
and
captain
biddle
who
commanded
the
in
her
two
successful
actions
had
their
prizes
measured
the
sank
so
rapidly
that
lawrence
could
not
get
very
accurate
measurements
of
her
he
states
her
to
be
four
feet
shorter
and
half
a
foot
broader
than
the
the
british
naval
historian
brenton
vol
v
also
states
that
they
were
of
about
the
same
tonnage
but
we
have
more
satisfactory
evidence
from
captain
biddle
he
stayed
by
his
prize
nearly
two
days
and
had
her
thoroughly
examined
in
every
way
and
his
testimony
is
of
course
final
he
reports
that
the
was
by
actual
measurement
two
feet
shorter
and
somewhat
broader
than
the
and
with
thicker
scantling
she
tonned
compared
to
the
a
difference
of
about
one
half
of
one
per
cent
this
testimony
is
corroborated
by
that
of
the
naval
inspectors
who
examined
the
after
she
was
captured
by
the
those
two
vessels
were
respectively
of
and
tons
and
as
such
they
ranked
on
the
navy
lists
the
american
and
her
sister
ships
were
very
much
longer
than
the
brig
sloops
of
the
class
but
were
no
broader
the
latter
being
very
tubby
all
the
english
sloops
were
broader
in
proportion
than
the
american
ones
were
thus
the
which
was
to
have
mounted
the
same
number
of
guns
as
the
had
much
more
beam
and
was
of
greater
tonnage
although
of
rather
less
length
the
when
captured
ranked
on
our
lists
as
of
tons
footnote
see
the
work
of
lieutenant
emmons
who
had
access
to
all
the
official
records
the
as
of
and
they
thus
continued
until
as
i
have
said
before
the
method
of
measurement
was
changed
when
the
former
ranked
as
of
and
the
latter
as
of
tons
james
however
makes
them
respectively
and
now
to
get
the
comparative
force
he
ought
to
have
adopted
the
first
set
of
measurements
given
or
else
have
made
them
and
out
of
the
twelve
actions
of
the
war
four
were
fought
with
frigates
like
the
and
seven
with
brig
sloops
of
the
class
and
as
the
and
were
both
regularly
rated
in
our
navy
we
get
a
very
exact
idea
of
our
antagonists
in
those
eleven
cases
the
twelfth
was
the
fight
between
the
and
the
in
which
the
latter
was
captured
the
was
apparently
a
little
smaller
than
her
foe
but
had
two
more
guns
which
she
carried
in
her
bridle
ports
as
my
purpose
in
giving
the
tonnage
is
to
get
it
comparatively
and
not
absolutely
i
have
given
it
throughout
for
both
sides
as
estimated
by
the
american
method
of
that
day
the

noticed
appendix
b
previous
history
of

states
navy
very
few
students
of
naval
history
will
deny
that
in
the
average
american
ship
was
superior
to
the
average
british
ship
of
the
same
strength
and
that
the
latter
was
in
turn
superior
to
the
average
french
ship
the
explanation
given
by
the
victor
is
in
each
case
the
same
the
american
writer
ascribes
the
success
of
his
nation
to
the
aptitude
of
the
american
character
for
the
sea
and
the
briton
similarly
writes
that
the
english
are
inherently
better
suited
for
the
sea
than
the
french
race
characteristics
may
have
had
some
little
effect
between
the
last
pair
of
combatants
although
only
a
little
and
it
is
that
they
somewhat
affected
the
outcome
of
the
struggle
but
they
did
not
form
the
main
cause
this
can
best
be
proved
by
examining
the
combats
of
two
preceding
periods
in
which
the
english
french
and
americans
were
at
war
with
one
another
during
the
years
the
united
states
carried
on
a
desultory
conflict
with
france
then
at
war
with
england
our
navy
was
just
built
and
was
rated
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
the
carrying
was
called
a
and
the
which
carried
a
while
the
rating
was
really
much
heavier
than
the
rating
on
after
an
hour
conflict
the
captured
the
french
frigate
the
americans
lost
the
french
men
killed
and
wounded
the
carried
but
guns
long
on
the
and
long
on
the
with
a
crew
of
men
according
to
troude
iii
carried
long
long
and
carronades
the
americans
report
her
number
of
men
as
nearly
four
hundred
thus
in
actual
footnote
french
shot
was
really
very
much
heavier
than
the
nominally
corresponding
english
shot
as
the
following
table
taken
from
captain
simmon
work
on
heavy
ordnance
london
will
show
nominal
french
weight
actual
weight
of
same
shot
in
of
shot
english
pounds
lbs
lbs
oz
not
nominal
weight
of
shot
the
was
superior
by
about
pounds
and
was
inferior
in
crew
by
from
to
men
this
would
make
the
vessels
apparently
nearly
equal
in
force
but
of
course
the
long
of
the
constellation
made
it
impossible
that
armed
only
with
long
should
contend
with
her
as
already
said
a
superiority
in
number
of
men
makes
very
little
difference
provided
each
vessel
has
ample
to
handle
the
guns
repair
damages
work
the
sails
etc
troude
goes
more
into
details
than
any
other
french
historian
but
i
think
his
details
are
generally
wrong
in
this
case
he
gives
the
instead
of
the
she
really
carried
and
also
supplies
her
with
carronades
of
which
species
of
ordnance
there
was
then
not
one
piece
in
our
navy
the
first
carronades
we
ever
had
were
those
carried
by
the
same
frigate
on
her
next
voyage
she
had
completely
changed
her
armament
having
long
on
the
ten
carronades
on
the
and
i
believe
long
on
the
forecastle
with
a
crew
of
men
thus
armed
she
encountered
and
fought
a
drawn
battle
with
troude
vol
iii
pp
and
describes
the
armament
of
the
latter
as
long
long
and
carronades
on
board
of
her
was
an
american
prisoner
james
howe
who
swore
she
had
guns
and
men
see
cooper
i
the
french
and
american
accounts
thus
radically
disagree
the
point
is
settled
definitely
by
the
report
of
the
british
captain
milne
who
in
the
frigate
captured
in
the
same
year
and
then
reported
her
armament
as
being
long
long
and
carronades
with
men
as
the
american
and
british
accounts
written
entirely
independently
of
one
another
tally
almost
exactly
it
is
evident
that
troude
was
very
greatly
mistaken
he
blunders
very
much
over
the
armament
thus
in
this
action
the
american
frigate
fought
a
draw
with
an
antagonist
nearly
as
much
superior
to
herself
as
an
american
was
to
a
british
in
november
the
frigate
of
tons
men
carrying
long
on
the
and
on
the
long
or
possibly
carronades
captured
after
two
hours
action
the
french
corvette
of
guns
long
the
was
about
the
same
size
as
her
foe
with
the
same
number
of
men
and
superior
in
metal
about
as
ten
to
nine
she
lost
and
the
men
troude
iii
gives
the
guns
long
and
carronades
if
this
is
true
she
was
in
reality
of
equal
force
with
the
but
i
question
if
troude
really
knew
anything
about
the
combatants
he
gives
the
of
the
same
size
and
build
as
the
guns
a
number
impossible
for
her
to
carry
he
continually
makes
the
grossest
errors
in
this
same
the
third
volume
for
example
he
arms
a
british
with
cannon
giving
her
a
broadside
fifty
per
cent
heavier
than
it
should
be
and
still
worse
states
the
ordinary
complement
of
a
british
frigate
to
be
men
instead
of
about
he
is
by
no
means
as
trustworthy
as
james
though
less
rancorous
the
united
states
schooner
of
guns
long
and
men
captured
the
french
of
guns
either
or
with
a
crew
of
men
and
passengers
and
the
the
sister
vessel
of
the
captured
numerous
strong
privateers
one
of
them
a
much
heavier
vessel
than
her
captor
made
a
most
obstinate
fight
she
was
the
brig
of
fourteen
and
men
of
whom
half
were
killed
or
wounded
the
had
killed
and
wounded
comparing
these
different
actions
it
is
evident
that
the
americans
were
superior
to
the
french
in
fighting
capacity
during
the
years
and
during
the
same
two
years
there
had
been
numerous
single
contests
between
vessels
of
britain
and
france
ending
almost
invariably
in
favor
of
the
former
which
i
mention
first
in
each
couple
the
frigate
captured
the
frigate
of
equal
force
the
british
frigate
captured
the
frigate
armed
with
guns
of
them
long
on
the
she
was
formidably
armed
and
as
heavy
as
the
the
lost
and
the
men
killed
and
wounded
the
frigate
with
the
loss
of
men
captured
the
frigate
which
lost
the
cutter
of
twelve
and
men
captured
the
privateer
of
fourteen
and
men
the
cutter
of
fourteen
and
men
captured
the
privateer
of
fourteen
and
men
the
with
men
engaged
the
and
with
in
all
men
and
captured
the
the
corvette
captured
by
surprise
the
frigate
the
of
ten
and
men
captured
the
of
guns
and
and
men
the
schooner
of
sixteen
carronades
and
men
fought
a
draw
with
the
privateer
of
long
and
six
carronades
finally
six
months
after
the
had
escaped
from
the
or
beaten
her
off
as
the
french
say
she
was
captured
by
the
british
frigate
which
threw
a
broadside
about
pounds
more
than
the
american
did
in
her
action
and
had
some
men
less
aboard
so
that
her
commander
captain
milne
with
the
same
force
as
commodore
truxtun
of
the
accomplished
what
the
latter
failed
to
do
reviewing
all
these
actions
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
while
the
americans
were
then
undoubtedly
much
superior
to
the
french
they
were
still
at
least
slightly
inferior
to
the
british
from
to
the
state
of
things
was
very
different
the
single
combats
were
too
numerous
for
me
to
mention
them
here
and
besides
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
at
the
truth
without
going
to
a
great
deal
of
trouble
the
accounts
given
by
cooper
sohomberg
and
troude
differing
so
widely
that
they
can
often
hardly
be
recognized
as
treating
of
the
same
events
but
it
is
certain
that
the
british
were
very
much
superior
to
the
americans
some
of
the
american
ships
behaved
most
disgracefully
deserting
their
consorts
and
fleeing
from
much
smaller
foes
generally
the
american
ship
was
captured
when
opposed
by
an
equal
force
although
there
were
some
brilliant
exceptions
to
this
with
the
french
things
were
more
equal
their
frigates
were
sunk
or
captured
time
and
again
but
nearly
as
often
they
sunk
or
captured
their
antagonists
some
of
the
most
gallant
fights
on
record
are
recounted
of
french
frigates
of
this
period
in
the
resisted
the
till
she
had
lost
men
and
had
actually
inflicted
a
loss
of
men
on
her
gigantic
antagonist
and
the
previous
year
the
had
performed
a
similar
feat
with
the
while
the
had
fought
for
five
hours
before
surrendering
to
the
and
each
of
force
equal
to
herself
she
lost
men
inflicting
a
loss
of
upon
her
two
antagonists
such
instances
make
us
feel
rather
ashamed
when
we
compare
them
with
the
fight
in
which
the
british
ship
beat
off
an
american
squadron
of
ships
including
two
of
equal
force
to
herself
or
with
the
time
when
the
and
attacked
and
captured
without
resistance
the
the
latter
ship
being
deserted
in
the
most
outrageously
cowardly
manner
by
her
consort
the
at
that
period
the
average
american
ship
was
certainly
by
no
means
equal
to
the
average
french
ship
of
the
same
force
and
the
latter
in
turn
was
a
little
but
only
a
little
inferior
to
the
average
british
ship
of
equal
strength
thus
in
the
british
stood
first
in
nautical
prowess
separated
but
by
a
very
narrow
interval
from
the
french
while
the
americans
made
a
bad
third
in
the
british
still
stood
first
while
the
americans
had
made
a
great
stride
forward
coming
close
on
their
heels
and
the
french
had
fallen
far
behind
into
the
third
place
in
the
relative
positions
of
the
british
and
french
were
unchanged
but
the
americans
had
taken
another
very
decided
step
in
advance
and
stood
nearly
as
far
ahead
of
the
british
as
the
latter
were
ahead
of
the
french
the
explanation
of
these
changes
is
not
difficult
in
the
american
war
vessels
were
in
reality
privateers
the
crews
were
unpracticed
the
officers
untrained
and
they
had
none
of
the
traditions
and
discipline
of
a
regular
service
at
the
same
time
the
french
marine
was
at
its
highest
point
it
was
commanded
by
officers
of
ability
and
experience
promoted
largely
for
merit
and
with
crews
thoroughly
trained
especially
in
gunnery
by
a
long
course
of
service
on
the
sea
in
courage
and
in
skill
in
the
management
of
guns
musketry
they
were
the
full
equals
of
their
english
antagonists
their
slight
inferiority
in
seamanship
may
it
is
possible
be
fairly
put
down
to
the
difference
in
race
it
seems
certain
that
when
serving
in
a
neutral
vessel
for
example
the
englishmen
aboard
are
apt
to
make
better
sailors
than
the
frenchmen
in
the
revolution
had
deprived
the
french
of
all
their
best
officers
had
let
the
character
of
the
marine
run
down
and
the
discipline
of
the
service
become
utterly
disorganized
this
exposed
them
to
frightful
reverses
and
these
in
turn
prevented
the
character
of
the
service
from
recovering
its
former
tone
meanwhile
the
americans
had
established
for
the
first
time
a
regular
navy
and
as
there
was
excellent
material
to
work
with
it
at
once
came
up
close
to
the
english
constant
and
arduous
service
fine
discipline
promotion
for
merit
and
the
most
unflagging
attention
to
practical
seamanship
and
gunnery
had
in
raised
it
far
above
even
the
high
english
standard
during
all
these
three
periods
the
english
marine
it
must
be
remembered
did
not
fall
off
but
at
least
kept
its
position
the
french
on
the
contrary
fall
off
while
the
american
navy
advanced
by
great
strides
to
the
first
place
appendix
c
after
my
work
was
in
press
i
for
the
first
time
came
across
russell
soley
naval
campaign
of
in
the
proceedings
of
the
united
states
naval
institute
for
october
it
is
apparently
the
precursor
of
a
more
extended
history
had
i
known
that
such
a
writer
as
professor
soley
was
engaged
on
a
work
of
this
kind
i
certainly
should
not
have
attempted
it
myself
in
several
points
our
accounts
differ
in
the
action
with
the
his
diagram
differs
from
mine
chiefly
in
his
making
the
steer
in
a
more
direct
line
while
i
have
represented
her
as
shifting
her
course
several
times
in
order
to
avoid
being
raked
bringing
the
wind
first
on
her
port
and
then
on
her
my
account
of
the
number
of
the
crew
of
the
is
taken
from
the
in
the
treasury
department
at
washington
which
contains
the
names
of
all
the
british
prisoners
received
aboard
the
after
the
fight
the
various
writers
used
larboard
and
starboard
with
such
perfect
indifference
in
speaking
of
the
closing
and
the
loss
of
the
that
i
hardly
knew
which
account
to
adopt
it
finally
seemed
to
me
that
the
only
way
to
reconcile
the
conflicting
statements
was
by
making
the
mast
act
as
a
rudder
first
to
keep
the
ship
off
the
wind
until
it
was
dead
aft
and
then
to
bring
her
up
into
it
if
this
was
the
case
it
deadened
her
speed
and
prevented
dacres
from
keeping
his
ship
yardarm
and
yardarm
with
the
foe
though
he
tried
to
steady
his
course
with
the
helm
but
in
this
view
it
rather
delayed
hull
raking
than
helped
him
if
professor
soley
account
is
right
i
hardly
know
what
to
make
of
the
statement
in
one
of
the
american
accounts
that
the
luffed
across
the
enemy
bow
and
of
cooper
statement
in
that
the
bowsprit
pressed
against
the
lee
or
port
quarter
in
the
action
of
the
with
the
i
have
adopted
statement
of
the
latter
force
professor
soley
follows
captain
jones
letter
which
gives
the
brig
three
additional
guns
and
pounds
more
metal
in
broadside
my
reason
for
following
james
was
that
his
account
of
the
force
agrees
with
the
regular
armament
of
her
class
captain
jones
gives
her
carronades
on
the
topgallant
forecastle
which
must
certainly
be
a
mistake
he
makes
her
long
but
all
the
other
british
brigs
carried
he
also
gives
her
another
gun
in
broadside
which
he
calls
a
and
lieutenant
biddle
in
a
letter
to
his
father
a
carronade
his
last
gun
should
perhaps
be
counted
in
i
excluded
it
because
the
two
american
officials
differed
in
their
account
of
it
because
i
did
not
know
through
what
port
it
could
be
fought
and
because
james
asserted
that
it
was
dismounted
and
lashed
to
the
forecastle
the
left
port
with
men
subtracting
the
pilot
and
two
men
who
were
drowned
makes
the
number
on
board
during
the
action
as
the
battle
was
fought
i
doubt
if
the
loss
of
the
brig
had
much
effect
on
the
result
had
it
been
her
object
to
keep
on
the
wind
or
had
the
loss
of
her
enabled
her
antagonist
to
cross
her
stern
as
in
the
case
of
the
and
the
accident
could
fairly
be
said
to
have
had
a
decided
effect
upon
the
contest
but
as
a
short
time
after
the
fight
began
the
vessels
were
running
nearly
free
and
as
the
herself
was
greatly
injured
aloft
at
the
time
and
made
no
effort
to
cross
her
foe
stern
it
is
difficult
to
see
that
it
made
much
difference
the
brig
were
all
right
and
as
she
was
not
the
cause
of
her
not
being
kept
more
under
command
was
probably
purely
due
to
the
slaughter
on
her
decks
professor
soley
represents
the
combat
of
the
and
as
a
plain
yardarm
and
yardarm
action
after
the
first
forty
minutes
i
have
followed
the
english
authorities
and
make
it
a
running
fight
throughout
if
professor
soley
is
right
the
enormous
disparity
in
loss
was
due
mainly
to
the
infinitely
greater
accuracy
of
the
american
fire
according
to
my
diagram
the
chief
cause
was
the
incompetency
of
the
commander
in
one
event
the
difference
was
mainly
in
the
gunnery
of
the
crews
in
the
other
it
was
mainly
in
the
tactical
skill
of
the
captains
the
question
is
merely
as
to
how
soon
carden
in
his
headlong
foolishly
rash
approach
was
enabled
to
close
with
decatur
i
have
represented
the
closing
as
taking
place
later
than
professor
soley
has
done
very
possibly
i
am
wrong
could
my
work
now
be
rewritten
i
think
i
should
adopt
his
diagram
of
the
action
of
the
but
in
the
action
with
the
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
mistaken
he
has
here
followed
the
british
accounts
but
they
are
contradicted
by
the
american
authorities
and
besides
have
a
very
improbable
look
when
the
came
round
for
the
second
time
on
the
port
tack
james
declares
the
passed
directly
across
her
stern
almost
touching
but
that
the
british
crew
overcome
by
astonishment
or
awe
did
not
fire
a
shot
and
that
shortly
afterward
the
manoeuvre
was
repeated
when
this
incident
is
said
to
have
occurred
the
crew
had
been
hard
at
work
fighting
the
guns
for
half
an
hour
and
they
continued
for
an
hour
and
a
half
afterward
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
they
would
have
foreborne
to
fire
more
than
one
gun
when
in
such
a
superb
position
for
inflicting
damage
even
had
the
men
been
struck
with
temporary
lunacy
the
officers
alone
would
have
fired
some
of
the
guns
moreover
if
the
courses
of
the
vessels
were
such
as
indicated
on
professor
soley
diagram
the
would
herself
have
been
previously
exposed
to
a
terrible
raking
fire
which
was
not
the
case
so
the
alleged
manoeuvres
have
a
decidedly
apocryphal
look
and
besides
they
are
flatly
contradicted
by
the
american
accounts
which
state
distinctly
that
the
remained
to
windward
in
every
portion
of
the
fight
on
this
same
tack
professor
soley
represents
the
as
forereaching
on
the
i
have
reversed
this
at
this
time
the
had
been
much
cut
up
in
her
rigging
and
aloft
generally
while
the
had
set
much
additional
sail
and
in
consequence
the
latter
forged
ahead
and
wore
in
the
smoke
unperceived
when
the
ships
came
foul
professor
soley
has
drawn
the
in
a
position
in
which
she
would
receive
a
most
destructive
stern
rake
from
her
antagonist
whole
broadside
the
positions
could
not
have
been
as
there
represented
the
bowsprit
came
foul
in
the
mizzen
rigging
and
as
the
latter
forged
ahead
she
pulled
the
former
gradually
round
till
when
they
separated
the
ships
were
in
a
head
and
stern
line
commodore
bainbridge
as
he
particularly
says
at
once
kept
away
to
avoid
being
raked
while
the
loss
of
the
aboard
the
would
cause
the
latter
to
come
up
in
the
wind
and
the
two
ships
would
again
be
running
parallel
with
the
american
to
leeward
i
have
already
discussed
fully
the
reasons
for
rejecting
in
this
instance
the
british
report
of
their
own
force
and
loss
this
was
the
last
defeat
that
the
british
officially
reported
the
admiralty
were
smarting
with
the
sting
of
successive
disasters
and
anxious
at
all
costs
to
put
the
best
possible
face
on
affairs
as
witness
croker
response
to
lord
dundonald
speech
in
the
house
there
is
every
reason
for
believing
that
in
this
case
the
reports
were
garbled
exactly
as
at
a
later
date
the
official
correspondence
preceding
the
terrible
disasters
at
cabul
was
tampered
with
before
being
put
before
the
public
see
mccarthy
history
of
our
own
times
it
is
difficult
to
draw
a
diagram
of
the
action
between
the
and
although
it
was
so
short
the
accounts
contradicting
one
another
as
to
which
ship
was
to
windward
and
which
on
the
larboard
tack
and
i
do
not
know
if
i
have
correctly
represented
the
position
of
the
combatants
at
the
close
of
the
engagement
lieutenant
conner
reported
the
number
of
men
aboard
the
fit
for
duty
as
lawrence
says
she
had
absent
in
a
prize
and
too
sick
to
be
at
quarters
this
would
make
an
original
complement
of
and
tallies
exactly
with
the
number
of
men
left
on
the
after
the
action
was
over
as
mentioned
by
lawrence
in
his
account
of
the
total
number
of
souls
aboard
the
of
the
just
before
starting
on
her
cruise
states
her
entire
complement
as
but
of
these
were
sick
and
left
behind
there
is
still
a
discrepancy
of
men
but
during
the
course
of
the
cruise
nothing
would
be
more
likely
than
that
four
men
should
be
gotten
rid
of
either
by
sickness
desertion
or
dismissal
at
any
rate
the
discrepancy
is
very
trivial
in
her
last
cruise
as
i
have
elsewhere
said
i
have
probably
overestimated
the
number
of
the
crew
this
seems
especially
likely
when
it
is
remembered
that
toward
the
close
of
the
war
our
vessels
left
port
with
fewer
supernumeraries
aboard
than
earlier
in
the
contest
if
such
is
the
case
the
and
were
of
almost
exactly
equal
force
my
own
comments
upon
the
causes
of
our
success
upon
the
various
historians
of
the
war
are
so
similar
to
those
of
professor
soley
that
i
almost
feel
as
if
i
had
been
guilty
of
plagiarism
yet
i
never
saw
his
writings
till
half
an
hour
ago
but
in
commenting
on
the
actions
of
i
think
the
professor
has
laid
too
much
stress
on
the
difference
in
dash
between
the
combatants
the
bore
down
with
perfect
confidence
to
engage
an
equal
foe
and
the
could
not
tell
till
the
opened
fire
that
the
latter
was
inferior
in
force
and
moreover
fought
in
sight
of
another
hostile
vessel
in
the
action
with
the
it
was
hull
and
not
dacres
who
acted
boldly
the
englishman
delaying
the
combat
and
trying
to
keep
it
at
long
range
for
some
time
in
this
fight
it
must
be
remembered
that
neither
foe
knew
the
exact
force
of
the
other
until
the
close
work
began
then
it
is
true
dacres
fought
most
bravely
so
with
the
james
particularly
says
that
she
did
not
know
the
force
of
her
foe
and
was
confident
of
victory
the
however
must
have
known
that
she
was
to
engage
a
superior
force
in
neither
of
the
first
two
frigate
actions
did
the
americans
have
a
chance
to
display
any
courage
in
the
actual
fighting
the
victory
was
won
with
such
ease
but
in
each
case
they
entered
as
bravely
although
by
no
means
as
rashly
or
foolishly
into
the
fight
as
their
antagonists
did
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
until
this
time
it
was
by
no
means
proved
that
were
better
guns
than
to
put
on
frigates
exactly
as
at
a
little
later
date
it
was
vigorously
contended
that
were
no
more
effective
guns
for
than
were
till
there
had
been
no
experience
to
justify
the
theory
that
the
was
the
better
gun
so
that
in
the
first
five
actions
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
british
showed
any
especial
courage
in
the
fight
it
was
more
properly
to
be
called
ignorance
after
the
fight
was
once
begun
they
certainly
acted
very
bravely
and
in
particular
the
desperate
nature
of
the
defence
has
never
been
surpassed
but
admitting
this
is
a
very
different
thing
from
admitting
that
the
british
fought
more
bravely
than
their
foes
the
combatants
were
about
on
a
par
in
this
respect
the
americans
it
seems
to
me
were
always
to
the
full
as
ready
to
engage
as
their
antagonists
were
on
each
side
there
were
few
men
such
as
commodore
rodgers
and
sir
george
collier
the
opposing
captains
on
lake
ontario
the
commander
of
the
and
perhaps
commodore
decatur
but
as
a
rule
either
side
jumped
at
the
chance
of
a
fight
the
difference
in
tactics
was
one
of
skill
and
common
sense
not
one
of
timidity
the
did
not
avoid
close
action
from
but
simply
to
take
advantage
of
her
opponent
rashness
hull
approach
was
as
bold
as
it
was
skilful
had
the
opponent
to
leeward
been
the
instead
of
the
her
would
not
have
saved
her
from
the
fate
that
overtook
the
latter
throughout
the
war
i
think
that
the
americans
were
as
bold
in
beginning
action
and
as
stubborn
in
continuing
it
as
were
their
foes
although
no
more
so
neither
side
can
claim
any
superiority
on
the
average
though
each
can
in
individual
cases
as
regards
courage
foolhardiness
does
not
imply
bravery
a
who
refused
to
use
his
guard
would
be
looked
upon
as
exceptionally
brainless
not
as
exceptionally
brave
yet
such
a
case
is
almost
exactly
parallel
to
that
of
the
captain
of
the
appendix
d
in
the
historical
register
of
the
united
states
edited
by
palmer
philadelphia
vol
state
papers
is
a
letter
from
lieut
babbitt
to
wm
crane
both
of
the
dated
in
which
he
says
that
of
the
six
men
imprisoned
by
the
british
on
suspicion
of
being
of
english
birth
four
were
americans
and
two
naturalized
citizens
he
also
gives
a
list
of
six
men
who
deserted
and
entered
on
the
of
whom
two
were
american
born
the
birthplaces
of
the
four
others
not
being
given
adding
these
last
we
still
have
but
six
men
as
the
number
of
british
aboard
the
it
is
thus
seen
that
the
crack
frigate
had
american
deserters
aboard
her
although
these
probably
formed
a
merely
trifling
faction
of
her
crew
as
did
the
british
deserters
aboard
the
crack
frigate
on
is
a
letter
of
from
geo
wise
purser
of
the
stating
that
twelve
of
that
ship
crew
had
been
detained
under
the
pretence
of
their
being
british
subjects
so
that
nine
per
cent
of
her
crew
may
have
been
british
or
the
proportion
may
have
been
very
much
smaller
on
is
a
letter
of
from
commodore
rodgers
in
which
he
states
that
he
encloses
the
of
ships
and
taken
out
of
the
captured
packet
and
that
these
show
that
in
august
one
eighth
of
the
crews
of
the
and
was
composed
of
americans
these
various
letters
thus
support
strongly
the
conclusions
reached
on
a
former
page
as
to
the
proportion
of
british
deserters
on
american
vessels
in
a
biographical
memoir
of
the
late
commodore
joshua
barney
from
autographical
notes
and
journals
edited
by
mary
barney
boston
on
pages
and
are
descriptions
of
the
flotilla
destroyed
in
the
patuxent
it
consisted
of
one
carrying
a
long

cutter
carrying
a
long
a
columbiad
and
four
carronades
and
thirteen
row
barges

in
leonard
creek
is
described
as
consisting
of
one
sloop
two
and
thirteen
barges
with
in
all
somewhat
over
men
and
it
is
claimed
that
the
flotilla
drove
away
the
blockading
frigates
entirely
unaided
the
infantry
force
on
shore
rendering
no
assistance
the
work
is
of
some
value
as
showing
that
james
had
more
than
doubled
the
size
and
almost
doubled
the
strength
of
barney
various
it
may
be
mentioned
that
on
commodore
barney
describes
the
frigate
which
carried
a
crew
of
men
and
was
armed
with
long
on
the
maindeck
and
long
on
the
spardeck
she
was
far
heavier
than
any
of
our
frigates
of
and
an
overmatch
for
anything
under
the
rank
of
a
this
gives
further
emphasis
to
what
i
have
already
stated
that
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
war
of
is
the
introduction
of
the
heavy
frigate
for
heavy
frigates
had
been
in
use
among
various
nations
for
thirty
years
previously
but
the
fact
that
for
the
first
time
the
heavy
frigate
was
used
to
the
best
possible
advantage
appendix
e
in
the
last
edition
of
james
naval
history
of
great
britain
published
in
london
in
by
richard
bentley
son
there
is
an
appendix
by
powell
devoted
to
the
war
of
mainly
to
my
account
thereof
powell
begins
by
stating
with
na√Øf
solemnity
that
most
british
readers
will
be
surprised
to
learn
that
notwithstanding
the
infinite
pains
taken
by
william
james
to
render
his
history
a
monument
of
accuracy
and
notwithstanding
the
exposure
he
brought
upon
contemporary
misstatements
yet
to
this
day
the
americans
still
dispute
his
facts
it
is
difficult
to
discuss
seriously
any
question
with
a
man
capable
of
writing
down
in
good
faith
such
a
sentence
as
the
above
james
unlike
brenton
and
cooper
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
be
accurate
but
if
powell
will
read
the
comments
on
his
accounts
which
i
have
appended
to
the
description
of
almost
every
battle
he
will
see
that
james
stands
convicted
beyond
possibility
of
doubt
not
merely
of
occasional
inaccuracies
or
errors
but
of
the
systematic
malicious
and
continuous
practice
of
every
known
form
of
wilful
misstatement
from
the
suppression
of
the
truth
and
the
suggestion
of
the
false
to
the
lie
direct
to
a
man
of
his
character
the
temptation
was
irresistible
for
when
he
came
to
our
naval
war
he
had
to
appear
as
the
champion
of
the
beaten
side
and
to
explain
away
defeat
instead
of
chronicling
victory
the
contemporary
american
writers
were
quite
as
boastful
and
untruthful
no
honorable
american
should
at
this
day
endorse
their
statements
and
similarly
no
reputable
englishman
should
permit
his
name
to
be
associated
in
any
way
with
james
book
without
explicitly
disclaiming
all
share
in
or
sympathy
with
its
scurrilous
mendacity
powell
efforts
to
controvert
my
statements
can
be
disposed
of
in
short
order
he
first
endeavors
to
prove
that
james
was
right
about
the
tonnage
of
the
ships
but
all
that
he
does
is
to
show
that
his
author
gave
for
the
english
frigates
and
sloops
the
correct
tonnage
by
english
and
french
rules
this
i
never
for
a
moment
disputed
what
i
said
was
that
the
tonnage
of
the
various
pairs
of
combatants
as
given
by
james
was
all
wrong
and
this
powell
does
not
even
discuss
james
applied
one
system
correctly
to
the
english
vessels
but
he
applied
quite
another
to
the
american
especially
on
the
lakes
powell
actually
quotes
admiral
chads
as
a
witness
because
he
says
that
his
father
considered
james
account
of
the
fight
accurate
if
he
wishes
such
testimony
i
can
produce
many
relatives
of
the
perrys
porters
and
rodgers
of
who
insist
that
i
have
done
much
less
than
justice
to
the
american
side
he
says
i
passed
over
silently
james
schedule
of
dimensions
of
the
frigates
and
sloops
this
is
a
mistake
i
showed
by
the
testimony
of
captains
biddle
and
warrington
and
lieutenant
hoffman
that
his
measurements
the
absolute
measurements
being
of
no
consequence
for
the
american
and
british
sloops
are
all
wrong
and
the
same
holds
true
of
the
frigates
powell
deals
with
the
weight
of
shot
exactly
as
he
does
with
the
tonnage
that
is
he
seeks
to
show
what
the
weight
of
the
british
shot
was
but
he
does
not
touch
upon
the
point
at
issue
the
weight
of
the
british
and
american
shot
when
he
comes
to
the
lake
actions
powell
is
driven
to
conclude
that
what
i
aver
must
be
accurate
because
he
thinks
the
was
the
size
of
the
instead
of
half
as
large
again
she
mounted
guns
in
battery
on
her
main
deck
as
against
the
and
stood
to
the
latter
as
the
did
to
the
and
because
an
american
writer
very
properly
expresses
dissatisfaction
with
commodore
chauncy
what
powell
thinks
this
last
statement
tends
to
prove
would
be
difficult
to
say
in
the
body
of
my
work
i
go
into
the
minute
details
of
the
strength
of
the
combatants
in
the
lake
action
i
clearly
show
that
james
was
guilty
of
gross
and
wilful
falsification
of
the
truth
and
no
material
statement
i
make
can
be
successfully
controverted
so
much
for
powell
but
a
much
higher
authority
frank
chiswell
has
recently
published
some
articles
which
tend
to
show
that
my
conclusions
as
to
the
tonnage
of
the
sea
vessels
not
as
to
the
lake
vessels
which
are
taken
from
different
sources
are
open
to
question
in
the
appendix
to
my
first
edition
i
myself
showed
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
reconcile
all
the
different
statements
that
the
most
that
could
be
done
was
to
take
one
method
and
apply
it
all
through
admitting
that
even
in
this
way
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
all
the
cases
square
with
one
another
chiswell
states
that
the
american
tonnage
measurements
properly
taken
never
could
give
results
for
frigates
varying
largely
from
the
english
tonnage
but
a
statement
like
this
is
idle
for
the
answer
to
the
never
could
is
that
they
if
chiswell
will
turn
to
james
naval
occurrences
he
will
find
the
set
down
as
tons
and
the
as
of
but
in
the
american
navy
lists
which
are
those
i
followed
the
is
put
down
as
of
tons
a
simple
application
of
the
rule
of
three
shows
that
even
if
i
accepted
james
figures
i
would
be
obliged
to
consider
the
as
of
about
tons
to
make
her
correspond
with
the
system
i
had
adopted
for
the
american
ships
but
this
is
not
all
james
gives
the
length
of
the
as
in
in
the
navy
department
at
washington
are
two
plans
of
the
one
is
dated
and
gives
her
length
as
in
this
difference
in
measurement
would
make
a
difference
of
odd
tons
so
that
by
the
american
mode
she
must
certainly
have
been
over
tons
instead
of
under
as
by
the
british
rules
the
second
plan
in
the
navy
department
much
more
elaborate
than
the
first
is
dated
and
gives
the
length
as
it
is
probably
this
that
emmons
and
the
united
states
navy
lists
have
followed
as
i
did
myself
in
calling
the
tonnage
of
the
since
finding
the
plan
of
however
i
think
it
possible
that
the
other
refers
to
the
second
vessel
of
the
name
which
was
built
in
if
this
is
true
then
the
as
well
as
the
and
should
be
put
down
as
about
tons
less
than
the
measurements
given
by
emmons
and
adopted
by
me
but
even
if
this
is
so
she
must
be
considered
as
tonning
over
using
the
method
i
have
applied
to
the
therefore
adopting
the
same
system
that
i
apply
to
the
american
frigates
the
british
frigates
were
of
over
not
under
tons
as
for
the
james
makes
her
but
and
in
long
while
the
american
he
puts
at
in
but
lieut
official
report
makes
the
former
and
the
plans
in
the
state
department
at
washington
make
the
latter
in
in
length
i
care
nothing
for
the
different
methods
of
measuring
different
vessels
what
i
wish
to
get
at
is
the
comparative
measurement
and
this
stands
as
above
the
comparative
tonnage
is
thus
the
very
reverse
of
that
indicated
by
james
figures
finally
as
to
the
brigs
james
makes
them
some
ten
feet
shorter
than
the
american
in
the
washington
archives
i
can
find
no
plan
on
record
of
the
measurements
of
the
captured
but
in
the
navy
department
volume
of
the
letters
of
master
commandants
under
date
of
may
is
the
statement
of
the
surveyor
of
the
port
of
charleston
that
she
measured
tons
in
another
place
it
is
given
as
james
makes
her
but
as
he
makes
the
american
whereas
she
stands
on
our
list
as
of
the
application
of
the
same
rule
as
with
the
frigates
gives
us
even
taking
his
own
figures
as
her
tonnage
when
measured
as
our
ships
were
but
the
measurements
of
the
surveyor
of
the
port
who
examined
the
are
corroborated
by
the
statements
of
captain
biddle
who
captured
her
sister
brig
the
biddle
reported
that
the
latter
was
two
feet
shorter
and
a
little
broader
than
his
own
ship
the
which
was
of
tons
this
would
correspond
almost
exactly
with
the
surveyor
estimate
it
still
seems
impossible
to
reconcile
all
these
conflicting
statements
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
on
the
whole
in
the
sea
not
the
lake
vessels
i
have
put
the
british
tonnage
too
high
on
the
scale
i
have
adopted
for
the
american
and
frigates
and
sloops
like
the
hornet
and
the
british
frigates
ought
to
be
put
down
as
of
a
little
over
and
the
british
sloops
as
of
between
and
tons
in
other
words
of
the
twelve
actions
of
the
war
five
those
of
the
and
and
and
and
and
were
between
vessels
of
nearly
equal
size
in
six
the
american
was
the
superior
about
in
the
proportion
of
five
to
four
rather
more
in
the
case
of
the
frigates
rather
less
in
the
case
of
the
brigs
and
in
one
that
of
the
and
the
british
sloop
was
the
bigger
in
a
somewhat
similar
ratio
this
correction
would
be
in
favor
of
the
british
but
in
a
more
important
particular
i
think
i
have
done
injustice
to
the
americans
i
should
have
allowed
for
the
short
weight
of
american
metal
on
the
lakes
taking
off
seven
per
cent
from
the
nominal
broadsides
of
perry
and
macdonough
for
the
american
ordnance
was
of
exactly
the
same
quality
as
that
on
the
ocean
vessels
while
the
british
was
brought
over
from
england
and
must
have
shown
the
same
superiority
that
obtained
on
the
ships
moreover
i
am
now
inclined
to
believe
that
both
the
and
the
which
were
originally
french
ships
still
carried
french
on
their
and
that
therefore
about
pounds
should
be
added
to
the
broadside
weight
of
metal
of
each
the
american
accounts
stated
this
to
be
the
case
in
both
instances
but
i
paid
no
heed
to
them
until
my
attention
was
called
to
the
fact
that
the
english
had
captured
enormous
quantities
of
french
cannon
and
shot
and
certainly
used
the
captured
ordnance
on
some
of
their
ships
in
writing
my
history
i
have
had
to
deal
with
a
mass
of
confused
and
contradictory
testimony
which
it
has
sometimes
been
quite
impossible
to
reconcile
the
difficulty
being
greatly
enhanced
by
the
calculated
mendacity
of
james
and
some
others
of
the
earlier
writers
both
american
and
british
often
i
have
had
simply
to
balance
probabilities
and
choose
between
two
sets
of
figures
aware
that
whichever
i
chose
much
could
be
said
against
the
choice
it
has
therefore
been
quite
impossible
to
avoid
errors
but
i
am
confident
they
have
been
as
much
in
favor
of
the
british
as
the
americans
and
in
all
important
points
my
statements
are
substantially
accurate
i
do
not
believe
that
my
final
conclusions
on
the
different
fights
can
be
disputed
james
asserts
that
the
american
ships
were
officered
by
cunning
cowards
and
manned
to
the
extent
of
half
their
force
in
point
of
effectiveness
by
renegade
british
i
show
that
the
percentage
of
seamen
aboard
the
american
ships
was
probably
but
little
greater
than
the
percentage
of
seamen
aboard
the
british
ships
and
as
for
the
charges
of
cowardice
there
were
but
two
instances
in
which
it
could
be
fairly
urged
against
a
beaten
crew
that
of
the
british
and
that
of
the
american
for
the
cases
of
sir
george
collier
commodore
rodgers
chauncy
yeo
the
commander
of
the
can
not
be
considered
as
coming
under
this
head
james
states
that
there
was
usually
a
great
superiority
of
force
on
the
side
of
the
americans
this
is
true
but
i
show
that
it
was
not
nearly
as
great
as
he
makes
it
and
that
in
dealing
with
the
lake
flotillas
his
figures
are
absolutely
false
to
the
extent
of
even
reversing
the
relative
strength
of
the
combatants
on
lake
champlain
where
the
americans
won
although
with
an
inferior
force
in
the
one
noteworthy
british
victory
that
of
the
all
british
authors
fail
to
make
any
allowance
for
the
vital
fact
that
the
crew
had
been
drilled
for
seven
years
whereas
the
had
an
absolutely
new
crew
and
had
been
out
of
port
just
eight
hours
yet
such
a
difference
in
length
of
drill
is
more
important
than
disparity
in
weight
of
metal
as
a
whole
it
must
be
said
that
both
sides
showed
equal
courage
and
resolution
that
the
americans
usually
possessed
the
advantage
in
material
force
and
that
they
also
showed
a
decided
superiority
in
fighting
skill
notably
in
marksmanship
