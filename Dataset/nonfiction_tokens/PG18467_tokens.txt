preface
to
the
present
edition
the
popular
favor
with
which
former
editions
of
this
work
have
been
received
has
required
the
production
of
such
a
vast
number
of
copies
that
the
original
electrotype
plates
from
which
it
has
heretofore
been
printed
have
been
completely
worn
out
the
book
has
been
in
london
england
where
six
editions
have
already
been
necessary
to
supply
the
demand
for
it
in
order
to
continue
its
publication
to
meet
the
demand
which
is
still
active
in
this
country
it
has
been
necessary
inasmuch
as
the
original
electrotype
plates
have
become
worn
and
useless
to
the
work
throughout
this
has
afforded
the
author
an
opportunity
to
carefully
revise
the
book
and
many
portions
that
it
may
embody
the
latest
discoveries
and
improvements
in
medicine
and
surgery
in
performing
this
labor
he
has
been
greatly
assisted
by
contributions
and
valuable
aid
kindly
supplied
by
his
staff
of
associate
specialists
in
medicine
and
surgery
who
constitute
the
faculty
of
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
that
part
of
the
book
treating
of
diseases
and
their
remedies
will
be
found
to
be
thoroughly
reliable
the
prescriptions
recommended
therein
having
all
received
the
sanction
and
endorsement
of
medical
gentlemen
of
rare
professional
attainments
and
mature
experience
the

buffalo
january
preface
to
the
first
edition
every
family
needs
a
common
sense
medical
adviser
the
frequent
inquiries
from
his
numerous
patients
throughout
the
land
suggested
to
the
author
the
importance
and
popular
demand
for
a
reliable
work
of
this
kind
consequently
he
has
been
induced
to
prepare
and
publish
an
extensive
dissertation
on
physiology
hygiene
temperaments
diseases
and
domestic
remedies
it
is
for
the
interest
and
welfare
of
person
not
only
to
understand
the
means
for
the
preservation
of
health
but
also
to
know
what
remedies
should
be
employed
for
the
alleviation
of
the
common
ailments
of
life
the
frequency
of
accidents
of
all
kinds
injuries
sustained
by
machinery
contusions
drowning
poisoning
fainting
and
also
of
sudden
attacks
of
painful
diseases
such
as
headache
affections
of
the
heart
and
nerves
inflammation
of
the
eye
ear
and
other
organs
renders
it
necessary
that
should
possess
sufficient
knowledge
to
enable
them
to
employ
the
proper
means
for
speedy
relief
to
impart
this
important
information
is
the
aim
of
the
author
moreover
this
volume
treats
of
human
temperaments
not
only
of
their
influence
upon
mental
characteristics
and
bodily
susceptibilities
but
also
of
their
vital
and
combinations
which
transmit
to
the
offspring
either
health
hardihood
and
longevity
or
feebleness
disease
and
death
it
clearly
points
out
those
temperaments
which
are
compatible
with
each
other
and
harmoniously
blend
and
also
those
which
when
united
in
marriage
result
in
barrenness
or
produce
in
the
offspring
imbecility
deformity
and
idiocy
these
matters
are
freely
discussed
from
original
investigations
and
clinical
observations
thus
rendering
the
work
a
true
and
scientific
guide
to
marriage
while
instruction
is
imparted
for
the
care
of
the
body
those
diseases
alas
how
prevalent
are
investigated
which
are
sure
to
follow
as
a
consequence
of
certain
abuses
usually
committed
through
ignorance
that
these
ills
do
exist
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
the
author
is
consulted
by
multitudes
of
unfortunate
young
men
and
women
who
are
desirous
of
procuring
relief
from
the
weaknesses
and
derangements
incurred
by
having
unwittingly
violated
physiological
laws
although
some
of
these
subjects
may
seem
out
of
place
in
a
work
designed
for
member
of
the
family
yet
they
are
presented
in
a
style
which
can
not
offend
the
most
fastidious
and
with
a
studied
avoidance
of
all
language
that
can
possibly
displease
the
chaste
or
disturb
the
delicate
susceptibilities
of
persons
of
either
sex
this
book
should
not
be
excluded
from
the
young
for
it
is
eminently
adapted
to
their
wants
and
imparts
information
without
which
millions
will
suffer
untold
misery
it
is
a
modesty
which
debars
the
youth
of
our
land
from
obtaining
such
information
as
its
title
indicates
the
author
aims
to
make
this
book
a
useful
and
practical
medical
adviser
he
proposes
to
express
himself
in
plain
and
simple
language
and
so
far
as
possible
to
avoid
the
employment
of
technical
words
so
that
all
his
readers
may
readily
comprehend
the
work
and
profit
by
its
perusal
written
as
it
is
amid
the
many
cares
attendant
upon
a
practice
embracing
the
treatment
of
thousands
of
cases
annually
and
therefore
containing
the
fruits
of
a
rich
and
varied
experience
some
excuse
exists
for
any
literary
imperfections
which
the
critical
reader
may
observe
the
author

these

rise
to
the
delightful
sensations
of
existence
health
is
essential
to
the
accomplishment
of
every
purpose
while
sickness
thwarts
the
best
intentions
and
loftiest
aims
we
are
continually
deciding
upon
those
conditions
which
are
either
the
source
of
joy
and
happiness
or
which
occasion
pain
and
disease
prudence
requires
that
we
should
meet
the
foes
and
obviate
the
dangers
which
threaten
us
by
turning
all
our
philosophy
science
and
art
into
practical
the
profession
of
medicine
is
no
its
labors
are
constant
its
toils
unremitting
its
cares
unceasing
the
physician
is
expected
to
meet
the
grim
monster
break
the
jaws
of
death
and
pluck
the
spoil
out
of
his
teeth
ear
is
ever
attentive
to
entreaty
and
within
his
faithful
breast
are
concealed
the
disclosures
of
the
suffering

elate
him
as
conquest
flushes
the
victor
honors
are
lavished
upon
the
brave
soldiers
who
in
the
struggle
with
the
foe
have
covered
themselves
with
glory
and
returned
victorious
from
the
field
of
battle
but
how
much
more
brilliant
is
the
achievement
of
those
who
overwhelm
disease
that
common
enemy
of
mankind
whose
victims
are
numbered
by
millions
is
it
meritorious
in
the
physician
to
modestly
veil
his
discoveries
regardless
of
their
importance
if
he
have
light
why
hide
it
from
the
world
truth
should
be
made
as
universal
and
as
sunlight
we
say
give
light
to
all
who
are
in
darkness
and
a
remedy
to
the
afflicted
everywhere
we
as
a
people
are
becoming
idle
living
in
luxury
and
ease
and
in
the
gratification
of
artificial
wants
some
indulge
in
the
use
of
food
rendered
unwholesome
by
bad
cookery
and
think
more
of
gratifying
a
morbid
appetite
than
of
supplying
the
body
with
proper
nourishment
others
devote
unnecessary
attention
to
the
display
of
dress
and
a
genteel
figure
yielding
themselves
completely
to
the
sway
of
fashion
such
intemperance
in
diet
and
dress
manifests
itself
in
the
general
appearance
of
the
unfortunate
transgressor
and
exposes
his
folly
to
the
world
with
little
less
precision
than
certain
vices
signify
their
presence
by
a
breath
body
nose
and
kindred
manifestations
they
coddle
themselves
instead
of
practicing
and
appear
to
think
that
the
chief
end
of
life
is
gratification
rather
than
useful
endeavor
i
purpose
to
express
myself
candidly
and
earnestly
on
all
topics
relating
to
health
and
appeal
to
the
common
sense
of
the
reader
for
justification
although
it
is
my
aim
to
simplify
the
work
and
render
it
a
practical
guide
to
the
farmer
mechanic
mariner
and
yet
i
trust
that
it
may
not
prove
less
acceptable
to
the
scholar
in
its
discussion
of
the
problems
of
life
not
only
does
the
method
adopted
in
this
volume
of
treating
of
the
functions
of
the
brain
and
nervous
system
present
many
new
suggestions
in
its
application
to
hygiene
the
management
of
disease
generation
and
the
development
and
improvement
of
man
but
the
conclusions
correspond
with
the
results
of
the
latest
investigations
of
the
world
most
distinguished
my
object
is
to
inculcate
the
facts
of
science
rather
than
the
theories
of
philosophy
unto
us
are
committed
important
health
trusts
which
we
hold
not
merely
in
our
own
behalf
but
for
the
benefit
of
others
if
we
discharge
the
obligations
of
our
trusteeship
we
shall
enjoy
present
strength
usefulness
and
length
of
days
but
if
we
fail
in
their
performance
then
inefficiency
incapacity
and
sickness
will
follow
the
sequel
of
which
is
pain
and
death
let
us
then
prove
worthy
of
this
generous
commission

we
may
enjoy
the
sweetest
of
all

in
this
chapter
we
propose
to
consider
life
in
its
primitive
manifestations
is
the
science
of
living
bodies
or
the
science
of
life
every
organ
of
a
living
body
has
a
function
to
perform
and
treats
of
these
functions
means
the
peculiar
action
of
some
particular
organ
or
part
there
can
be
no
vital
action
without
change
and
no
change
without
organs
every
living
thing
has
a
structure
and
treats
of
the
structures
of
organized
bodies
several
chapters
of
this
work
are
devoted
to
which
treats
of
the
human
organism
and
its
functions
the
beginning
of
life
is
called
its
perpetuation
by
the
former
function
individual
life
is
insured
by
the
latter
it
is
maintained
since
nutrition
sustains
life
it
has
been
pertinently
termed
latent
life
is
contained
in
a
small
globule
a
mere
atom
of
matter
in
the
this
element
is
something
which
under
certain
conditions
develops
into
a
living
organism
the
entire
realm
of
nature
teems
with
these
interesting
phenomena
thus
manifesting
that
admirable
adjustment
of
internal
to
external
relations
which
claims
our
profound
attention
we
are
simply
humble
scholars
waiting
on
the
threshold
of
nature
glorious
sanctuary
to
receive
the
interpretation
of
her
divine
mysteries
some
have
conjectured
that
chemical
and
physical
forces
account
for
all
the
phenomena
of
life
and
that
organization
is
not
the
result
of
vital
forces
physical
science
can
not
inform
us
what
the
beginning
was
or
how
vitality
is
the
result
of
chemical
forces
nor
can
it
tell
us
what
transmutations
will
occur
at
the
end
of
organized
existence
this
mysterious
eludes
the
grasp
of
the
profoundest
scientists
and
its
presence
in
the
world
will
ever
continue
to
be
an
astonishing
and
indubitable
testimony
of
divine
power
the
physical
act
of
generation
is
accomplished
by
the
union
of
two
cells
and
as
this
conjugation
is
known
to
be
so
generally
indispensable
to
the
organization
of
life
we
may
fairly
infer
that
it
is
a
universal
necessity
investigations
with
the
microscope
have
destroyed
the
hypothesis
of
spontaneous
generation
these
show
us
that
even
the
minutest
living
forms
are
derived
from
a
parent
organization
generation
so
long
as
the
vital
principle
remains
in
the
it
lies
dormant
that
part
of
the
cell
which
contains
this
principle
is
called
the
which
consists
of
a
flattened
body
having
a
long
appendage
tapering
to
the
finest
point
if
it
be
remembered
that
a
line
is
the
part
of
an
inch
in
length
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
extreme
minuteness
of
the
body
of
a
human
spermatozoön
when
we
state
that
it
is
from
to
part
of
a
line
and
the
filiform
tail
of
a
line
in
length
this
which
can
be
discerned
only
with
a
powerful
magnifying
glass
is
perfectly
transparent
and
moves
about
by
executing
a
vibratile
motion
with
its
long
appendage
within
this
speck
of
matter
are
hidden
the
multifarious
forces
which
under
certain
favorable
conditions
result
in
organization
magnify
this
infinitesimal
atom
a
thousand
times
and
no
congeries
of
formative
powers
is
perceived
wherewith
to
work
out
the
wonders
of
its
existence
yet
it
contains
the
principle
which
is
the
contribution
on
the
part
of
the
male
toward
the
generation
of
a
new
being
the
or

the
special
contribution
on
the
part
of
the
female
for
the
production
of
another

the
human
ovum
though
larger
than
the
spermatozoön

also
extremely

is
generally
used

as

convenient
name
to
designate
certain
assemblages
of
individuals

striking
points
of
resemblance
scientific
writers
as
a
rule
no
longer
hold
that
what
are
usually
called
are
constantly
unvarying
and
unchangeable
quantities
recent
researches
point
to
the
conclusion
that
species
vary
more
or
and
in
some
instances
that
the
variation
is
so
great
that
the
limits
of
general
specific
distinctness
are
sometimes
exceeded
our
space
will
not
permit
us
to
do
more
than
merely
indicate
the
two
great
fundamental
ideas
upon
which
the
leading
theories
of
the
time
respecting
the
origin
of
species

it

the

the
ancients
rude
in

of

referred
the
origin
of
life
to
divine
determination
the
thought
was
crudely
expressed
but
well
represented
in
the
following
verse
then
god
smites
his
hands
together
and
strikes
out
a
soul
as
a
spark
into
the
organized
glory
of

from
the
deeps
of

to
a
greek
myth
prometheus
formed
a

image
from
the
dust
of
the
ground
and
then
by
fire
stolen
from
heaven
animated
it
with
a
living
soul
spontaneous
generation
once
held
its
sway
and
now
the
idea
of
natural
evolution
is
popular
some
believe
that
the
inpenetrable
mystery
of
life
is
evolved
from
the
endowments
of
nature
and
build
their
imperfect
theory
on
observations
of
her
concrete
forms
and
their
manifestations
to
which
all
our
investigations
are
restricted
but
every
function
indicates
purpose
every
organism
evinces
intelligent
design
and
proclaim
a
divine
power
something
can
not
come
out
of
nothing
with
reason
and
philosophy
is
an
impossibility
we
therefore
accept
the
display
of
wisdom
in

as
indicative
of
the
designs
of

thus
has
he
written
his
claims
for

profoundest
admiration

homage
all
over
every
object
that
he
has
made
if
you
ask
is
there
any
advantage
in
considering
the
phenomena
of
nature
as
the
result
of
divine
volition
we
answer
that
this
belief
corresponds
with
the
universally
acknowledged
ideas
of
accountability
for
with
a
wise
and
efficient
cause
we
infer
there
is
an
intelligent
creation
and
the
desire
to
communicate
guide
and
bless
is
responded
to
by
man
who
loves
obeys
and
enjoys
nothing
is
gained
by
attributing
to
nature
vicegerent
forces
is
it
not
preferable
to
say
that
she
responds
to
intelligent
loving
omnipotence
our
finiteness
is
illustrated

initiation
into

being
emerging

diminutive

sight
we
gradually

first
the

neutralizes
the

both

seem
to
exert

over
the
fatty
substances

the
pulmonary
veins
which

carry
it
to

auricle
the
veins
of

abdominal
organs

with
the
tissues
which
take
from

which
are
transmitted
through
the
veins
to

thence
by
the
arteries
to
the
lungs
and
various
excretory
organs
the
blood
from
the
system
in
general
except
the
lungs
is
poured
into
the
right
auricle
by
two
large
veins
called
the
superior

heart
contracts
rhythmically
the
contractions
commencing
at
the
base
in
each
auricle
and
extending
towards
the
apex
now
it
follows
from
the
anatomical
arrangement
of
this
organ
that
when
the
auricles
contract
the
blood
contained
in
them
is
forced
through
the
openings
into
the
ventricles

contractions
then
extending

the
ventricles
in
a
manner
the
great
proportion
of
the
blood
being
prevented
from
the
auricles
by
the
tricuspid
and
mitral
valves
is
forced
onward
into
the
pulmonary
artery
from
the
right
ventricle
and
into
the
aorta
from
the
left
ventricle
when
the
contents
of
the
ventricles
are
suddenly
forced
into

a
shock
is
given
to
the
entire
mass
of
fluid
which
they
contain

beating
of

if
the

is
placed
over

certain
sounds
are
heard
which
recur
with

a
comparatively
long
dull
sound
then
a
short
sharp
sound
then
a
pause
and
then
the
long
dull
sound
again
the
first
sound
is
caused
mainly
by
the
tricuspid

mitral
valves
and
the

is
the
result
of
sudden
closure

experiments
have
shown
that

action

the
nerves
which
ordinarily
keep
up
a
moderate
contraction
of
the
muscular
coats
of
the
arteries
is
lost
and
the
vessels
relax
and
become
distended
with
arterial
blood
which
is
a
warm
and
bright
red
fluid
thereupon
a
burning
sensation
is
felt
and
the
skin
grows
red

degree
of
the
blush
depending
upon
the
intensity
of
the
emotion
the
pallor
produced
by
fright
and
by
extreme
anxiety
is
purely
the
result
of
a
local
modification
of
the
circulation
brought
about
by
an
of
the
nerves
which
supply
the
small
arteries
causing
them
to
contract

the

while
the

great
numbers
of

the

abundantly
supplied

the
density
of
a

depends
upon
the
amount
of

which
it
contains
thus
experiment
has
shown
that
in

the
function
by
which
the
venous
blood
conveyed
to
the
lungs
by

is
converted
into

this
is
effected
by
the
elimination
of

and
by
the
absorption
of

which
is
taken
into
the

by
the
act

the
act

is
performed
chiefly
by
the

since
the

which

to

is
indispensable
to
the

of

and
the

in

the

is
similar
to

of
the
higher

though
not
so
complex
for
there
are
no

upon

is

thus
being

its

there

difference
between

the

previously
described
to

of

to

where
it
is
converted

it

ready
to
be
distributed
throughout
the

and

of

but
who
can
understand
their
wonderful
mechanism
so
perfect
in

its

though
every

is
subservient
to

yet
each
has
its
own

to
perform
the
minute
are
for
the
aeration
of
the

the
larger
bronchial
tubes
ramify
the
lungs
and
suffuse
them
with

the
trachea
serves
as
a
passage
for
the
air
to
and
from
the
lungs
while
at
its
upper
extremity
is
the
larynx
which
has
been
fitly
called
the
organ
of
the
human

at
its

we
find
a

extremely
so
for
they
are
the
principal

through

the

a

extending
from
the
top
of
the
spinal
canal
where
it
is
continuous
with
the
brain
to
about
an
inch
below
the
small
of
the

where
it
tapers

into
a
filament
from
this

are
distributed
fibers
and
filaments
to
the
muscles
and
integument
of
at

of
the
body
the
spinal
cord
is
divided
in
front
through
the
middle
nearly
as
far
as
its
center
by
a
deep
fissure
called
the

behind
in
a
similar

each
of

is
lined
with
the

with

consequently
the
substance
of
the
two
halves
of
the

is
only
connected
by
a
narrow
isthmus
or
bridge
perforated
by
a
minute
tube
which
is
termed
the
of
the
spinal
cord
each
half
of
the
spinal
cord
is
divided
lengthwise
into
three
nearly
equal
parts
which
are
termed
the
anterior
lateral
and
posterior
columns
by
the
lines
which
join
together
two
parallel
series
of
bundles
of
nervous
filaments
which
compose
the
roots
of
the
spinal
nerves
the
roots
of
those
nerves
which
are
found
along
that
line
nearest
the
posterior
surface
of
the

are
termed
the
posterior
roots
those
which
spring
from
the

are
known
as
the
anterior

several
of
these
anterior
and
posterior
roots
situated
at
about
the

height
on
opposite
sides
of
the
spinal
cord
converge
and
combine
into
what
are
called
the
and
then
two
bundles
anterior
and
posterior
unite
and
form
the
trunk
of
a
spinal
nerve
the
nerve
trunks
make
their
way
out
of
the
spinal
canal
through
apertures
between
the
vertebra
called
the
and
then
divide
into
numerous
branches
their
ramifications
extending
principally
to
the
muscles
and
the

there
are
pairs
of
spinal

eight
of
which
are
termed
cervical
twelve
dorsal
five
lumbar
and
six
sacral
with
reference
to
that
part
of
the
cord
from
which
they
originate
when
the
cord
is
divided
into
transverse
sections
it
is
found
that
each
half
is
composed
of
two
kinds
of
matter
a
white
substance
on
the
outside
and
a
grayish
substance
in
the
interior
the
as
it
is
termed
lies
in
the
form
of
an
irregular
crescent
with
one
end
considerably
larger
than
the
other
and
having
the
concave
side
turned
outwards
the
ends
of
the
crescent
are
termed
the
or
the
one
pointing
forward
being
called
the
the
other
one
the
the
convex
sides
of
these
cornua
approach
each
other
and
are
united
by
the
bridge
which
contains
the
central
canal
there
is
a
marked
difference
in
the
structure
of
the
gray
and
the
white
matter
the
white
matter
is
composed
entirely
of
nerve
fibers
held
together
by
a
framework
of
connective
tissue
the
gray
matter
contains
a
great
number
of
ganglionic
corpuscles
or
in
addition
to
the
when
the
are
irritated
in
any
manner
whether
by
pinching
burning
or
the
application
of
electricity
all
the
muscles
which
are
supplied
with
branches
from
this
immediately
contract
and
pain
is
experienced
the
severity
of
which
depends
upon
the
degree
of
the
irritation
and
the
pain
is
attributed
to
that
portion
of
the
body
to
which
the
filaments
of
the
are
distributed
thus
persons
who
have
lost
limbs
often
complain
in
cold
weather
of
an
uneasiness
or
pain
which
they
locate
in
the
fingers
or
toes
of
the
limb
which
has
been
amputated
and
which
is
caused
by
the
cold
producing
an
irritation
of
the
the
filaments
or
fibers
of
which
supplied
the
fingers
or
toes
of
the
lost
member
on
the
other
hand
if
the
anterior
bundle
of
given
off
from
the
spinal
cord
is
irritated
in
precisely
the
same
way
only
half
of
these
effects
is
produced
all
the
muscles
which
are
supplied
with
fibers
from
that
trunk
contract
but
no
pain
is
experienced
conversely
if
the
posterior
bundle
of
is
irritated
none
of
the
muscles
to
which
the
filaments
of
the
nerve
are
distributed
contract
but
pain
is
felt
throughout
the
entire
region
to
which
these
filaments
are
extended
it
is
evident
from
these
facts
that
the
fibers
composing
the
posterior
bundles
of
only
transmit
sensory
impulses
and
the
filaments
composing
the
anterior
only
transmit
motor
impulses
accordingly
they
are
termed
respectively
the
and
the
this
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
when
the
posterior
root
of
a
spinal
nerve
is
divided
all
sensation
in
the
parts
to
which
the
filaments
of
that
nerve
are
distributed
is
lost
but
the
power
of
voluntary
movement
of
the
muscles
remains
on
the
other
hand
if
the
anterior
roots
are
severed
the
power
of
voluntary
motion
of
the
muscles
is
lost
but
sensation
remains
it
appears
from
these
experiments
that
when
a
nerve
is
irritated
a
change
in
the
arrangement
of
its
molecules
takes
place
which
is
transmitted
along
the
but
if
the
are
divided
or
compressed
tightly
at
any
point
between
the
portion
irritated
and
the
muscle
or
the
effect
ceases
immediately
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
in
which
a
message
is
stopped
by
the
cutting
of
a
telegraph
wire
when
the
nerves
distributed
to
a
limb
are
subjected
to
a
pressure
sufficient
to
destroy
the
molecular
continuity
of
their
filaments
it
goes
to
sleep
as
we
term
it
the
power
of
transmitting
sensory
and
motor
impulses
is
lost
and
only
returns
gradually
as
the
molecular
continuity
is
restored
from
what
has
been
said
it
is
plain
that
a
sensory
nerve
is
one
which
conveys
a
sensory
impulse
from
the
peripheral
or
outer
part
of
a
nerve
to
the
spinal
cord
or
brain
and
which
is
therefore
termed
and
that
a
motor
nerve
is
one
which
transmits
an
impulse
from
the
nerve
centre
or
is
so
difference
in
structure
or
in
chemical
or
physical
composition
can
be
discerned
between
the
afferent
and
the
nerves
a
certain
period
of
time
is
required
for
the
transmission
of
all
impulses
the
speed
with
which
an
impulse
travels
has
been
found
to
be
comparatively
slow
being
even
less
than
that
of
sound
which
is
feet
per
second
the
experiments
heretofore
related
have
been
confined
solely
to
the
nerves
we
may
now
proceed
to
the
consideration
of
what
takes
place
when
the
spinal
cord
is
operated
upon
in
a
similar
way
if
the
cord
be
divided
with
a
knife
or
other
instrument
all
parts
of
the
body
supplied
with
nerves
given
off
below
the
division
will
become
paralyzed
and
insensible
while
all
parts
of
the
body
supplied
with
nerves
from
the
spinal
cord
the
division
will
retain
their
sensibility
and
power
of
motion
if
however
only
the
posterior
half
of
the
spinal
cord
is
divided
or
destroyed
there
is
loss
of
sensation
alone
and
if
the
anterior
portion
is
cut
in
two
and
the
continuity
of
the
posterior
part
is
left
undisturbed
there
is
loss
of
voluntary
motion
of
the
lower
limbs
but
sensation
remains
reflex
action
of
the
spinal
cord
in
relation
to
the
brain
the
spinal
cord
is
a
great
mixed
motor
and
sensory
nerve
but
in
addition
to
this
it
is
also
a
distinct
nervous
centre
in
which
originate
and
terminate
all
those
involuntary
impulses
which
exert
so
potent
an
influence
in
the
preservation
and
economy
of
the
body
that
peculiar
power
of
the
cord
by
which
it
is
enabled
to
convert
sensory
into
motor
impulse
is
that
which
distinguishes
it
as
a
central
organ
from
a
nerve
and
is
called
the
gray
matter
and
not
the
white
is
the
part
of
the
cord
which
possesses
this
power
this
reflex
action
is
a
special
function
of
the
spinal
cord
and
serves
as
a
monitor
to
and
regulator
of
the
organs
of
nutrition
and
circulation
by
placing
them
ordinarily
beyond
the
control
of
conscious
volition
illustration
fig
if
the
foot
of
a
decapitated
frog
is
irritated
there
is
an
instant
contraction
of
the
corresponding
limb
if
the
irritation
is
intense
the
other
limb
also
contracts
these
motions
indicate
the
existence
in
some
part
of
the
spinal
cord
of
a
distinct
capable
of
converting
and
reflecting
impulses
it
has
been
found
by
experiment
that
the
same
movements
will
take
place
if
the
irritation
be
applied
to
any
portion
of
the
body
to
which
the
spinal
nerves
are
distributed
thus
giving
undoubted
evidence
that
the
spinal
cord
in
its
entirety
is
capable
of
causing
these
reflections
fig

the
course
of

impulse
passes
upward
along
the
posterior
root

it
reaches
the

matter
of
the

by
which
it
is
reflected
as
a
motor
impulse
downward
along
the
anterior
root
to
the

whence
the

was
received
this
is
the
reflex
action
of

spinal

there
is
no
consciousness
or
sensation
connected
with
this
action
and
the
removal
of

the
sympathetic
system
does
not
diminish
its
activity
even
after
death
it
continues
for
some
time
longer
in
than
in
animals
on
account
of
the
difference
in
temperature
thus
showing
this
property
of
the
spinal
cord
by
disease
or
the
use
of
certain
poisons
this
activity
may
be
greatly
augmented

is
frequently
observed

induce

familiar

it
has
been
demonstrated
that
the
irritability
of
the
nerves
may
be
impaired

destroyed
while
that
of
the

to
which
they

of

been
admirably
summed
up
by

exerting
a
general

some
physiologists
suppose
that
the
cerebellum
is
the
source
of
that
harmony
or
associative
power
which
all
voluntary
movements
and
effects
that
delicate
adjustment
of
cause
to
effect
displayed
in
muscular
action
this
fact
may
be
proved
by
removing
the
cerebellum
of
a
bird
and
observing
the
results
which
are
an
uncertainty
in
all
its
movements
and
difficulty
in
standing
walking
or
flying
the
bird
being
unable
to
direct
its
course
in
the
animal
kingdom
we
find
an
apparent
correspondence
between
the
size
of
the
cerebellum
and
the
variety
and
extent
of
the
movements
of
the
animal
instances
are
cited
however
in
which
no
such
proportion
exists
and
so
the
matter
is
open
to
controversy
the
general
function
of
the
cerebellum
therefore
can
not
be
explained
but
the
latest
experiments
in
physiological
and
anatomical
science
seem
to
favor
the
theory
that
it
is
in
some
way
connected
with
the
harmony
of
the
movements
this
by
which
the
adjustment
of
voluntary
motion
is
supposed
to
be
effected
is
not
in
reality
a
having
its
seat
in
the
brain
substance
but
is
the
harmonious
action
of
many
forces
through
the
cerebellum

five
times
the
space
of
all
the
other
portions
of
the
brain
together
it
is
of
an
ovoid
form
and
becomes
larger
as
it
approaches
the
posterior
region
of
the
skull
a
longitudinal
fissure
covered
by
the
dura
mater
separates
the
cerebrum
into
two
hemispheres
which
are
connected
at
the
base
of
the
fissure
by
a
broad
medullary
band
termed
the
each
hemisphere
is
subdivided
into
three
lobes
the
anterior
gives
form
to
the
forehead
the
middle
rests
in
the
cavity
at
the
base
of
the
skull
and
the
posterior
lobe
is
supported
by
the
tentorium
by
which
it
is
separated
from
the
cerebellum
beneath
one
of
the
most
prominent
characteristics
of
the
cerebrum
is
its
many
and
varied
these
do
not
correspond
in
all
brains
nor
even
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
same
brain
yet
there
are
certain
features
of
similarity
in
all
accordingly
anatomists
enumerate
four
of
the
first
order
begins
at
the
and
passes
upward
and
around
the
corpus
callosum
toward
the
posterior
margin
of
that
body
thence
descends
to
the
base
of
the
brain
and
terminates
near
its
origin
the
second
order
originates
from
the
first
and
subdivides
into
two
convolutions
one
of
which
composes
the
exterior
margin
and
superior
part
of
the
corresponding
hemisphere
while
the
other
forms
the
circumference
of
the
of
the
third
order
from
six
to
eight
in
number
is
found
in
the
interior
portion
of
the
brain
and
inosculates
between
the
first
and
second
orders
the
fourth
is
found
on
the
outer
surface
of
the
hemisphere
in
the
space
between
the
of
the
second
clasp
a
peculiar
fact
relating
to
these
convolutions
is
observed
by
all
anatomists
mental
development
is
always
accompanied
by
an
increasing
dissimilarity
between
their
proportional
size
the
cerebral
hemispheres
may
be
injured
or
lacerated
without
any
pain
to
the
patient
the
effect
seems
to
be
one
of
stupefaction
without
sensation
or
volition
a
brain
is
a
very
good
indication
of
intelligence
and
mental
activity
that
the
cerebrum
is
the
seat
of
the
reasoning
powers
and
all
the
higher
intellectual
functions
is
proved
by
three
facts
if
this
portion
of
the
brain
is
removed
it
is
followed
by
the
loss
of
intelligence
if
the
human
cerebrum
is
injured
there
is
an
impairment
of
the
intellectual
powers
in
the
animal
kingdom
as
a
rule
intelligence
corresponds
to
the
size
of
the
cerebrum
this
general
law
of
development
is
modified
by
differences
in
the
cerebral
texture
men
possessing
comparatively
small
brains
may
have
a
vast
range
of
thought
and
acute
reasoning
powers
anatomists
have
found
these
peculiarities
to
depend
upon
the
quantity
of
gray
matter
which
enters
into
the
composition
of
the
brain
in
the
system
there
are
three
different
kinds
of
reflex
actions
those
of
the
spinal
cord
and
medulla
oblongata
are
performed
without
any
consciousness
or
sensation
on
the
part
of
the
subject
the
second
class
embraces
those
of
the
tuber
annulare
where
the
perception
gives
rise
to
motion
without
the
interference
of
the
intellectual
faculties
these
are
denominated
purely
reflex
actions
and
include
all
those
operations
of
animals
which
seem
to
display
intelligent
forethought
thus
the
beaver
builds
his
habitation
over

water
but
not

the

years
ago
there
is
no
improvement
no
retrogression
trains
of
thought
have
been
termed
a
third
class
of
reflex
actions
it
is
evident
that
the
power
of
reasoning
is
in
a
degree
possessed
by
some
of
the
for
instance
a
tribe
of
monkeys
on

foraging
expedition

station
guards
at
different
parts
of
the
field
to
warn
the
plunderers
of
the
approach
of
danger
a
cry
from
the
sentinel
and
general
confusion
is
followed
by
retreat
reason
only
attains
its
highest
development
in
man
in
whom
it
passes
the
bounds
of
ordinary
existence
and
with
the
magic
wand

the

an

admitted
to
be

may
give
two
simple
illustrations

if

three

will
be
seen
in

a
third
on

of

the
reflection
on

remains
unchanged
while
that

the
anterior
surface
of
the

gradually
diminishes
and
approximates
in
size
the

giving
conclusive
evidence

taste
the
sense
of
taste
is
directly
connected
with
the
preservation
and
nutrition
of
the
body
a
delicious
flavor
produces
a
desire
to
eat
a
savory
substance
some
writers
on
hygiene
have
given
this
sense
an
instinctive
character
by
assuming
that
all
articles
having
an
agreeable
taste
are
suitable
for
diet
the
nerves
of

over
the
surface
of

the
mucous
membrane

coats
of

the
filiform
papillae
are
generally
long

pointed

are

over

of

the
root
of

the
largest
of
this
class
of
papillae
have
other
very
small
papillae
upon
their
surfaces
it
is
now
pretty
satisfactorily
established
that
the
circumvallate
or
fungiform
papillae
are
the
only
ones
concerned
in
the
special
sense
of
taste
the
conditions
necessary
to
taste
are
that
the
substance
be
in
solution
either
by
artificial
means
or
by
the
action
of
the
saliva
and
that
it
be
brought
in

with
the
sensitive
filaments
imbedded
in

nerves
of

are
both
and
in
their
functions
if
the
general
sensibility
of
the
nerves
of

is
unduly
excited
the
function
of
sensibility
is
lost
for
some
time
if
a
peppermint
lozenge
is
taken
into
the
mouth
it
strongly
excites
the
general
sensibilities
of
taste
and
the
power
of
distinguishing
between
special
flavors
is
lost
for
a
few
moments
a
nauseous
drug
may
then
be
swallowed
without
experiencing
any
disagreeable
taste
paralysis
of
the
facial
nerve
often
produces
a
marked
effect
in
the
sensibility
of
the
tongue
where
this
influence
lies
has
not
been
fully
explained
probably
it
is
indirect
being
produced
by
some
alteration
in
the
vascularity
of

reference
to
brainless
animals
whoso
knots
of
ganglia
throughout
their

act
automatically
as
little
brains
shows
that
instinct
arises
simultaneously
with
the
development
of
the
functions
over
which
it
presides
here
begins
rudimentary
unreasoning
intelligence
it
originates
within
the
body
as
an
inward
vital
impulse
is
manifested
in
an
undeviating
manner
and
therefore
displays
no
intention
or
discretion
while
carpenter
likens
the
human
organism
to
a
keyed
instrument
from
which
any
music
it
is
capable
of
producing
can
be
called
forth
at
the
will
of
the
performer
he
compares
a
bee
or
any
other
insect
to
a
barrel
organ
which
plays
with
the
greatest
exactness
a
certain
number
of
tunes
that
are
set
upon
it
but
can
do
nothing
else
instinct
can
not
learn
from
experience
or
improve
by
practice
but
it
seems
to
be
the
prophetic
germ
of
a
higher
intelligence
it
is
nearly
as
difficult
to
draw
the
dividing
line
between
instinct
and
a
low
grade
of
intelligence
as
it
is
to
distinguish
between
the
psychical
and
psychological
functions
of
the
brain
the
intimate
relation
of
instinct
to
intelligence
is
admirably
illustrated
in
the
working
with
forethought
it
selects
a
habitation
constructs
comb
collects
honey
provides
a
cell
for
the
ova
covers
the
chrysalis
for
which
it
deposits
special
nourishment
and
is
disposed
to
defend
its
possessions
it
is
a
social
insect
lives
in
colonies
chastises
trespassers
fights
its
enemies
and
defends
its
home
it
manifests
a
degree
of
intelligence
but
its
sagacity
is
instinctive
reason
though
not
so
acute
as
instinct
becomes
by
education
discerning
and
keenly
penetrative
and
reveals
the
very
secrets
of
profound
thought
we
recall
the
aptness
of
remark
there
is
even
a
certain
antagonism
between
instinct
and
intelligence
so
that
instinct
loses
its
force
and
peculiar
characteristics
whenever
intelligence
becomes
developed
animals
having
larger
reasoning
powers
manifest
less
instinct
and
some
as
the
leopard
exercise
both
in
a
limited
degree
this
double
endowment
with
instinct
and
low
reasoning
intelligence
is
indicated
by
his
lying
in
ambush
awaiting
his
prey
the
being
selected
near
the
haunt
of
other
animals
where
nature
offers
some
allurement
to
gratify
the
appetite
simple
reflex
action
is
an
instinctive
expression
manifesting
an
intuitive
perception
almost
intelligent
as
shown
by
the
contraction
of
the
stomach
upon
the
food
simply
because
it
impinges
upon
the
inner
coats
and
thus
excites
them
to
action
a
better
illustration
because
it
displays
sympathy
is
when
the
skin
disabled
by
cold
can
not
act
and
its
duties
are
largely
performed
by
the
kidneys
though
reflex
action
is
easily
traced
in
the
lower
organic
processes
some
writers
have
placed
it
on
a
level
with
rational
deliberation
undoubtedly
all
animals
having
perception
have
also
what
perception
implies
consciousness
and
this
indicates
the
possession
in
some
degree
of
reason
reflex
action
extends
into
the
domain
of
thought
reflex
action
or
instinct
answers
to
the
animal
faculties
such
as
acquisitiveness
secretiveness
selfishness
reproductiveness
and
accomplishes
two
important
purposes
and
the
reproduction
of
the
specie
with
many
persons
these
appear
to
be
the
chief
ends
of
life
the
psychical
functions
connect
not
only
with
animal
propensities
but
also
with
the
highest
psychological
faculties
instinct
is
the
representative
of
animal
conditions
just
as
the
highest
spiritual
faculties
are
indicative
of
qualities
and
principles
the
consistent
mean
of
conduct
is
an
equilibrium
between
these
ultimate
tendencies
of
our
being
the
psychological
functions
render
the
animal
nature
subservient
to
the
rule
of
purity
and
holiness
and
deeply
influence
it
by
the
essential
elements
of
spiritual
existence
the
psychical
organs
sustain
an
intermediate
relation
receiving
the
impressions
of
the
bodily
propensities
and
likewise
of
the
highest
emotions
obviously
these
extreme
influences
the

of

of

the

the

the
animal
faculties

the
propensities
like
gravity

their
force
upon

the
emotions
pour
forth
torrents

and
produce
rhapsodies

the

extreme

those

capable
of
fully

are
especially
susceptible
to
bodily
sensations
tears
are
physical

excessive
anxiety
of

produces

this

is
very
remarkable
joy

love
as
well
as

the

by
entirely
removing
the

of
an

that
of

invariable
result

an
unusual
increase

another
symptom
which
usually
follows
the
removal
of
the
spleen
is
an
unnatural
ferocity

disposition
without

the

attack

in

these

violence
are

the

quite
conclusively
that
the

moderates

and
with
the
will

judgment
in
controlling

we
shall
briefly
consider
the
practical
question
whether
the

mind
can
be
ideally
arranged
and
presented
so
as
to
more
completely
reveal
their
relations
to

disclose
their
effects

modern

conceive
that
mind
consists
of
a
triad
of
essentials
emotion

physiologists
assign
to
the
cerebrum
its
functions

them
as

we
shall
assume
it
as
a
conceded
proposition
the
regions

occupy

little
more

often

the
explanation
is
this
when
the

powerfully
excited
they
quickly
expend
the

so
that
the

swoons

undue
expenditure
of

group
those

system
they
are
subject
to
the

of

a
large
development
of
these

is
indicated
by
an

the
character

is
represented
by
the

when

they
are

inasmuch
as
they

deprave
the

derange

destroy

poison

and
pervert
all
the
functions
of

and
their
injurious
influence
upon
the

basilar

is
equally
remarkable
they
excite
combativeness

and
exaggerate
the
influence
of

intemperance
results
in

the
legitimate
consequences
of
which
are
misunderstandings

imprisonment
and
the

it
is
therefore
evident
that
the
ultimate

of
these

are
tyrannical
cruel

they
are
opposed
to
the
noble
moral

than

it
is
animal
instinct
which
impels
the
soldier
to
seek
first
for
the
gratification
of
his
appetite
some
persons
instigated
by
carnivorous
desires
yearn
for
raw
meat

not

such
perversions
of
the

are
manifested
only
when
there
is
either

deficient

the
natural

large

to
sustain
these
vital

it
likewise

reports
the

hence
we
observe
that

give

to

excite

that

evident
from

fact
that

is
completely
prostrated
we
have
already
alluded

their

the

the

which
inevitably
follows
is
almost
unbearable
and

is
sought
by
repeating
and
increasing
the
poisonous

the
primary
influence
of
which
is
stimulating
the
ulterior
depressing
alcoholic
stimulants
unduly
excite
the

the
heart

the

and
consequently
the

is
carried
to
the
surface
of
the

where
it
counteracts
the

of

the

the

is
not
whether

have

the

the
seat
of

of
the

is
in
the
animal
economy
hence
the
avidity
with
which
its
structure

have
been
studied
in
our

for
although
much
remains
to
be
explained
much
has
certainly
been
accomplished
we
have
reason
to
believe
not
only
that
the
brain
is
the
center
of
the
whole
series
of
mental
manifestations
but
that
its
several
parts
are
so
many
organs
each

which
performs
its
peculiar
and

office

the
number

be
the
most
remarkable

interesting
not
only
because
of
the
variety
of
movements

distinctly
expressive
character
of
this

but
on
account
of
the
close
conformity
which
the
simple
arrangement
of
the
convolutions
of
its
brain
bears
to
their
more
complex
disposition
in
the
human
cerebrum
it
is
premature
to
say
what
import
we
shall
attach
to
these
experiments
but
they
have
established
the
correctness
of
the
doctrine
advanced
on
page
that
thought
the
product
of
cerebral
functions
is
a
class
of
the
cerebrum
is
not
only
the
source
of
ideas
but
also
of
those
movements
which
correspond
to
and
accompany
these
ideas
certain
cerebral
changes
call
forth
mental
states
and
muscular
movements
which
are
mutually
responsive
they
indicate
that
various
functions
are
automatic
or
dependent
upon
the
will
and
as
we
have
seen
experiments
indicate
that
the
electric
current
when
applied
to
the
cerebrum
excites
involuntary
reflex
action
we
can
not
say
how
far
these
experimental
results
justify
the
phrenological
classification
of
the
faculties
of
mind
by
establishing
a
relation
between
the
physical
and
psychical
states
this
short
and
unsatisfactory
account
furnishes
one
fact
which
seems
to
support
the
claim
of
such
a
relation
the
apparent
similarity
between
the
motor
center
of
the
lips
and
tongue
in
lower
animals
and
that
portion
of
the
human
cerebrum
in
which
disease
is
so
often
found
to
be
associated
with
or
loss
of
voice
while
these
experiments
are
by
no
means
conclusive
in
establishing
a
theory
yet
they
favor
it
it
is
wonderful
that
nervous
matter
can
be
so
arranged
as
not
only
to
connect
the
various
organs
of
the
body
but
at
the

time
to
be
the
agent
of
sensation

emotion
it
is
amazing
that
a
ray
of
light
after
traversing
a
distance
of
miles
can
by
falling
upon
the
retina
and
acting
as
a
stimulus
not
only
produce
a
contraction
of
the
pupil
but
excite
thoughts
which
analyze
that
ray
instantly
spanning
the
infinitude
of
trackless
space
the
same
penetrative
faculties
with
equal
facility
can
quickly
and
surely
discern
the
morbid
symptoms
of
body
and
mind
become
familiar
with
the
indications
of
disease
and
classify
them
scientifically
among
the
phenomena
of
nature
the
symptoms
of
disease
which
follow
certain
conditions
as
regularly
as
do
the
signs
of
development
and
mind
itself
is
no
exception
to
this
uniformity
of
nature
thoughts
result
from
conditions
and
manifest
them
as
evidently
as
the
falling
of
rain
illustrates
the
effect
of
gravity
the
perceptive
and
highest
emotive
faculties
of
man
depend
upon
this
simple
but
marvelously
endowed
nervous
substance
which
blends
the
higher
spiritual
with
the
lower
physical
functions
the
functions
of
the
body
are
performed
by
separate
organs
distinguished
by
peculiar
characteristics
to
elucidate
the
distinctions
between
dissimilar
mental
faculties
we
have
assigned
their
functions
with
characteristic
names
to
different
regions
of
the
head
as
they
unquestionably
influence
the
bodily
organs
we
are
sustained
by
physical
analogy
in
our
classification
our
knowledge
of
the
structure
and
functions
of
the
nervous
system
is
yet
elementary
and
we
are
patiently
waiting
for
scientists
to
develop
its
facts
and
verify
them
by
experimental
investigations
and
such
researches
as
time
alone
can
bring
to
perfection
while
real
progress
moves
with
slow
and
measured
the
inspirations
of
consciousness
and
the
inferences
of
logic
prepare
the
popular
mind
for
cerebral
analysis
no
true
system
can
contradict
the
facts
of
our
inner
experience
it
can
only
furnish
a
more
complete
explanation
of
their
relation
to
the
bodily
organs
it
should
be
expected
that
such
careful
and
experiments
as
are
necessary
to
establish
a
science
will
be
preceded
by
intuitive
judgments
and
accredited
observations
which
may
be
for
a
time
the
substitutes
of
those
more
abstruse
in
detail
we
have
in
accordance
with
popular
usage
treated
the
organs
of
thought
as
having
anatomical
relations
the
views
which
we
have
presented
in
this
chapter
may
seem
speculative
but
the
facts
suggesting
the
theory
demand
attention
and
we
have
attempted
to
gather
a
few
of
the
scattered
fragments
and
arrange
them
in
some
order
rather
than
leave
them
to
uncertainty
and
greater
mystery
it
is
by
method
and
classification
that
we
are
enabled
to
apply
our
knowledge
to
practical
purposes
possibly
to
some
especially
the
an
allusion
to
the
fact
that
cerebral
physiology
contributes
to
successful
results
in
the
practice
of
medicine
may
seem
to
be
an
exaggerated
pretension
none
however
who
are
conversant
with
the
facts
connected
with
the
author
experience
will
so
regard
this
practical
reference
for
the
statement
might
be
greatly
amplified
without
exceeding
the
bounds
of
truth
physicians
generally
undervalue
the
nervous
functions
and
overlook
the
importance
of
the
brain
as
an
indicator
of
the
conditions
of
the
physical
system
because
they
are
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
its
influence
over
the
bodily
functions
pathological
conditions
are
faithfully
represented
by
the
thoughts
and
words
when
used
to
describe
symptoms
become
the
symbols
of
feelings
which
arise
from
disease
how
few
physicians
there
are
who
can
interpret
the
thoughts
and
glean
from
the
expressions
and
sentences
of
a
letter
a
correct
idea
of
the
morbid
conditions
which
the
writer
wishes
to
portray
each
malady
as
well
as
every
temperament
has
its
characteristics
both
require
careful
and
critical
before
subjecting
the
patient
to
the
influence
of
remedial
agents
in
a
treatise
by
buchanan
entitled
outlines
of
lectures
on
the
neurological
system
of
anthropology
are
presented
original
ideas
useful
to
the
physician
his
researches
and
those
of
later
writers
together
with
our
own
investigations
have
greatly
increased
our
professional
knowledge
it
is
by
such
studies
and
investigations
that
we
have
been
prepared
to
interpret
with
greater
facility
the
indications
of
disease
and
diagnose
accurately
from
symptoms
which
have
acquired
a
deeper
significance
by
the
light
of
cerebral
physiology
we
are
enabled
to
adapt
remedies
to
constitutions
and
their
varying
conditions
with
a
fidelity
and
scientific
precision
which
has
rendered
our
success
in
treatment
widely
known
and
generally
acknowledged
we
annually
treat
thousands
of
invalids
whom
we
have
never
beheld
and
relieve
them
of
their
ailments
this
has
been
accomplished
chiefly
through
correspondence
when
patients
have
failed
to
delineate
their
symptoms
currently
or
have
given
an
obscure
account
of
their
ailments
we
have
been
materially
assisted
in
ascertaining
the
character
of
the
disease
by
photographs
of
the
subjects
the
cerebral
conformation
indicates
the
predisposition
of
the
patient
and
enables
us
to
estimate
the
strength
of
his
recuperative
energies
thus
we
have
a
valuable
guide
in
the
selection
of
remedies
particularly
suited
to
different
constitutions
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
diseases
the
success
attending
our
efforts
has
been
widely
appreciated
not
only
in
this
but
in
other
countries
where
civilization
refinement
luxurious
habits
and
effeminating
customs
prevail
this
fact
is
mentioned
not
only
as
an
illustration
of
the
personal
benefits
actually
derived
from
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
nervous
system
but
to
show
how
generally
and
extensively
these
advantages
have
been
shared
by
others
a
careful
study
of
cerebral
physiology
leads
us
deeper
into
the
mysteries
of
the
human
constitution
and
to
the
philosophical
contemplation
of
the
relations
of
mind
and
body
implies
not
only
a
knowledge
of
the
powers
of
the
mind
but
also
how
to
direct
and
use
them
for
its
own
improvement
and
he
who
has
the
key
to
can
unlock
the
mysteries
of
human
nature
and
be
eminently
serviceable
to
the
worlds
for
centuries
the
mind
has
been
spreading
out
its
treasury
of
revelations
to
be
turned
to
practical
account
in
ascertaining
the
constitution
and
determining
better
methods
of
treating
disease
since
comparative
anatomists
and
physiologists
have
revealed
the
structure
of
animals
and
the
functions
of
their
organs
from
the
lowest
protozoan
to
the
highest
vertebrate
the
physician
may
avail
himself
of
this
knowledge
and
thus
gain
a
deeper
insight
into
the
structure
and
physiology
of
man
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
physical
is
a
necessary
preparation
for
the
study
of
the
psychical
life
for
it
leads
to
the
understanding
of
their
mutual
relations
and
reactions
both
in
health
and
disease
consciousness
or
the
knowledge
of
sensations
and
mental
operations
has
been
variously
defined
it
is
employed
as
a
collective
term
to
express
all
the
psychical
states
and
is
the
power
by
which
the
soul
knows
its
own
existence
it
is
the
immediate
knowledge
of
any
object
whatever
and
seems
to
comprise
in
its
broadest
signification
both
matter
and
mind
for
all
objects
are
inseparable
from
the
cognizance
of
them
hence
the
significance
of
the
terms
and
people
are
better
satisfied
with
their
knowledge
of
matter
than
with
their
conceptions
of
the
nature
of
mind
the
nature
of
mind
since
this
subject
is
being
discussed
by
our
most
distinguished
scientists
we
will
conclude
this
chapter
with
an
extract
from
a
lecture
delivered
by
burt
wilder
at
the
american
institute
there
now
remains
to
be
disposed
of
in
some
way
the
question
as
to
the
nature
and
reality
of
mind
which
was
rather
evaded
at
the
commencement
of
the
lecture
the
reason
was
that
i
am
forced
to
differ
widely
from
the
two
great
physiologists
whom
i
have
so
often
quoted
this
evening
most
people
following
in
part
early
instruction
in
part
revelation
in
part
spiritual
manifestations
and
in
part
trusting
to
their
own
consciousness
hold
that
the
human
mind
is
a
spiritual
substance
which
is
associated
with
the
body
during
the
life
of
the
latter
in
this
world
and
which
remains
in
existence
after
the
death
of
the
body
and
forms
the
spiritual
clothing
or
embodiment
of
the
immortal
soul
and
that
the
individual
therefore
lives
after
death
as
a
spirit
in
the
human
form
that
of
this
spiritual
man
the
soul
is
the
essential
being
of
which
may
be
predicted
a
good
or
evil
nature
while
the
mind
which
clothes
it
as
a
body
consists
of
the
spiritual
substances
affections
and
thoughts
which
were
cherished
and
formed
during
the
natural
life
together
with
the
above
convictions
respecting
themselves
most
people
when
thinking
independently
of
theological
sublimations
feel
willing
to
admit
that
animals
have
in
common
with
man
fewer
or
more
natural
affections
and
thoughts
which
make
up
their
minds
but
that
the
inner
and
immortal
soul
which
would
retain
them
as
part
of
an
individual
after
death
of
the
body
is
not
possessed
by
the
beasts
that
perish
in
short
the
vast
majority
of
mankind
when
thinking
quietly
and
especially
in
seasons
of
bereavement
feel
well
assured
of
the
real
and
substantial
existence
of
the
human
mind
independently
of
its
temporary
association
with
the
perishable
body
but
in
antagonism
to
this
simple
and
comforting
faith
stand
theological
incomprehensibilities
on
the
one
hand
and
scientific
skepticism
on
the
other
the
former
would
have
us
believe
that
the
soul
is
a
mere
vapor
a
cloud
of
something
ethereal
of
which
can
be
expected
nothing
more
useful
than
around
the
throne
while
the
latter
asks
us
to
recognize
the
existence
of
nothing
which
the
eyes
can
not
see
and
fingers
touch
to
cease
imagining
that
there
is
a
soul
and
to
regard
the
mind
as
merely
the
product
of
the
brain
secreted
thereby
as
the
liver
secretes
bile
let
us
hear
what
the
two
leading
nervous
physiologists
of
this
country
have
to
say
upon
this
point
brain
is
not
strictly
speaking
the
organ
of
the
mind
for
this
statement
would
imply
that
the
mind
exists
as
a
force
independent
of
the
brain
but
the
mind
is
produced
by
the
brain
substance
and
intellectual
force
if
we
may
term
the
intellect
a
force
can
be
produced
only
by
the
transmutation
of
a
certain
amount
of
matter
there
can
be
no
intelligence
without
brain
flint
mind
may
be
regarded
as
a
force
the
result
of
nervous
action
and
characterized
by
the
ability
to
perceive
sensations
to
be
conscious
to
understand
to
experience
emotions
and
to
will
in
accordance
therewith
of
these
qualities
consciousness
resides
exclusively
in
the
brain
but
the
others
as
is
clearly
shown
by
observation
and
experiment
can
not
be
restricted
to
that
organ
but
are
developed
with
more
or
less
intensity
in
other
parts
of
the
nervous
hammond
thus
do
the
two
extremes
of
theology
and
science
meet
upon
a
common
ground
of
dreamy
emptiness
and
we
who
confess
our
comparative
ignorance
are
comforted
by
the
thought
that
some
other
things
have
been
from
the
wise
and
prudent
and
revealed
unto
babes
yet
while
feeling
thus
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
existence
of
spirit
and
of
a
creator
do
not
yet
seem
capable
of
logical
demonstration
the
denial
of
their
existence
is
not
incompatible
with
a
profound
acquaintance
with
material
forms
and
their
operations
and
on
the
other
hand
the
belief
in
their
existence
and
substantial
nature
and
in
their
powers
as
first
causes
have
never
interfered
with
the
recognition
of
the
material
forces
and
of
the
organisms
through
which
they
are
manifested
at
present
at
least
these
are
purely
matters
of
faith
but
although
the
spiritualist
using
the
term
in
its
broadest
sense
as
indicating
a
belief
in
spirits
may
feel
that
his
faith
discloses
a
beauty
and
perfection
in
the
union
otherwise
imperceptible
by
him
there
is
no
reason
why
this
difference
in
faith
should
make
him
despise
or
quarrel
with
his
materialist
for
the
latter
may
do
as
good
service
to
science
may
be
as
true
a
man
and
live
as
holy
a
life
although
from
other
motives
the
differences
between
religious
sects
are
mainly
of
faith
not
of
works
and
the
wise
of
all
denominations
are
gradually
coming
to
the
conviction
that
they
will
all
do
god
more
service
by
toleration
and
than
by
animosity
and
disunion
and
so
i
hold
that
until
the
spiritualist
feels
himself
able
to
demonstrate
to
the
unbeliever
the
existence
of
spirit
and
of
god
as
convincingly
as
a
mathematical
proposition
there
should
be
no
hard
words
or
feelings
upon
these
points
for
the
present
they
are
immaterial
in
every
sense
of
the
word
and
so
long
as
he
bows
to
the
facts
and
the
laws
of
nature
and
deals
with
his
fellow
men
as
he
would
be
done
by
so
long
will
i
work
with
him
side
by
side
knowing
even
though
i
can
not
tell
him
so
that
whether
or
not
he
joins
me
in
this
world
we
shall
meet
in
the
other
world
to
come
where
his
eyes
will
be
opened
and
where
his
lips
will
at
least
acquit
me
of
bigotry
and
intolerance
chapter

the
human
temperaments
organization
implies
vital
energy
since
there
can
be
no
organization
without
it
the
sperm
cell
as
we
have
previously
seen
exists
before
the
initiation
of
the
life
of
every
individual
organism
the
early
history
of
this
fertilizing
cell
which
is
composed
of
infinitesimal
molecules
which
contain
the
embryo
powers
of
life
is
only
partially
written
it
is
a
fact
authenticated
by
faraday
that
one
drop
of
water
contains
and
may
be
made
to
evolve
as
much
electricity
as
under
a
different
mode
of
display
would
suffice
to
produce
a
chemical
force
is
of
a
higher
order
than
physical
and
vital
force
is
of
a
still
higher
order
within
the
microscopic
compass
of
the
sperm
cell
are
a
great
number
of
forces
acting
simultaneously
which
require
the
answering
conditions
of
a
germ
cell
and
are
so
blended
as
to
occupy
a
minimum
of
space
the
union
of
these
subtle
elements
through
the
agency
of
their
physical
chemical
and
vital
forces
constitutes
the
initiation
of
life
elementary
matter
is
transformed
into
chemical
and
organic
compounds
by
natural
forces
upon
the
cessation
of
which
it
is
liberated
by
nature
great
destroyer
and
in
the
world
of
elements
thus
man
is
formed
out
of
the
very
dust
by
means
of
energies
which
reconstruct
the
crude
inert
matter
and
to
dust
he
returns
when
those
energies
cease
when
we
enter
upon
the
consideration
of
the
temperaments
we
should
bear
in
mind
one
peculiarity
of
life
that
it
combines
in
a
small
space
many
complex
powers
in
the
process
of
reproduction
there
is
a
complex
combination
of
organic
elements
structures
differ
as
greatly
as
their
functions
so
likewise
do
animals
vary
in
their
nature
and
organization
and
individuals
of
the
same
species
are
in
some
respects
dissimilar
yet
the
characteristics
which
have
distinguished
the
races
of
mankind
are
fundamental
and
faithfully
maintained
time
does
not
obliterate
them
within
are
found
enduring
peculiarities
and
although
each
individual
is
weaving
out
some
definite
pattern
of
organization
it
follows
the
type
of
the
race
as
well
as
the
more
immediate
antecedent
condition
what
then
is
a
but
a
of
these
determining
forces
a
certain
blending
manifested
in
the
constitution
by
signs
or
traits
which
we
denominate
the
different
races
of
mankind
must
have
their
several
standards
of
temperament
for
the
peculiarities
of
one
are
not
fully
descriptive
of
and
applicable
to
the
other
the
term
temperament
is
defined
by
dunglison
as
being
a
name
given
to
the
remarkable
differences
that
exist
between
individuals
in
consequence
of
the
variety
of
relations
and
proportions
between
the
constituent
parts
of
the
body
for
its
simplicity
and
scope
we
prefer
the
following
definition
suggested
by
our
friend
orin
davis
a
temperament
is
a
combination
of
organic
elements
so
arranged
as
to
characterize
the
constitution
this
leads
us
to
consider
some
of
the
elements
conditions
and
forces
which
give
character
to
the
organization
external
circumstances
supply
necessary
conditions
to
inward
activity
for
without
air
food
or
sunlight
all
living
animals
would
perish
everywhere
life
is
dependent
upon
conditions
and
circumstances
it
is
but
the
conditions
of
reproduction
are
very
complex
external
forces
are
transformed
and
in
turn
become
vital
or
formative
powers
development
is
a
transmutation
of
physical
and
chemical
forces
into
vital
energy
although
unable
to
compute
the
ultimate
factors
of
life
yet
we
may
illustrate
their
reproductive
possibilities
and
results
by
comparing
them
with
those
of
a
lower
order
animal
structures
are
mainly
composed
of
four
elements
oxygen
hydrogen
nitrogen
and
carbon
other
constituents
such
as
phosphorus
sulphur
potassium
sodium
calcium
magnesium
and

in

smaller
quantities
from

fabricated
an
organism
which
manifests
peculiar
properties
and
marvelous
functions
if
the
proportion
of
these
chemical
elements
be
varied
the
organic
compound
will
be
changed
or
the
proportions
remaining
the
same
if
the
of
the
elements
be
altered
different
compounds
will
be
produced
showing
that
the
properties
of
organized
substances
depend
upon
the
constitution
of
matter
rising
in
the
scale
of
organization
we
observe
that
every
variation
of
the
physical
and
chemical
processes
implies
a
corresponding
modification
of
the
vital
this
is
verified
by
the
peculiarities
of
the
several
races
of
mankind
individual
differences
are
likewise
modifications
of
these
processes
dynamical
or
vital
differentiation
depends
upon
these
modifications
for
the
display
of
vital
energy
and
is
always
associated
with
molecular
changes
but
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
an
effect
may
not
resemble
its
cause
in
and
the
of
a
chemical
compound
may
be
quite
different
from
those
of
its
individual
constituents
organic
matter
although
more
complex
may
exhibit
properties
both
like
and
unlike
its
constituent
elements
within
certain
boundaries
the
elements
seek
to
satisfy
their
affinities
we
discover
that
there
are
limits
between
the
genera
of
animals
as
well
as
the
races
of
mankind
not
less
really
though
perhaps
not
as
absolutely
are
there
individual
precincts
within
the
sphere
of
the
human
temperaments
which
can
not
be
passed
if
we
can
not
satisfactorily
explain
we
can
at
least
discover
a
reason
for
temperamental
limitation
it
is
not
designed
to
circumscribe
healthful
reproduction
but
to
serve
as
an
effectual
hindrance
to
abnormal
deviations
we
may
state
our
belief
in
more
positive
terms
that
the
temperamental
variations
are
essential
to
and
and
indispensable
to
and
every
individual
is
susceptible
to
impressions
which
dispose
to
action
impressions
which
excite
or
increase
this
disposition
are
called
vital
change
implies
the
existence
of
and
to
stimulation
the
stimulus
may
not
be
furnished
because
the
conditions
on
which
it
depends
are
wanting
again
susceptibility
may
exist
at
one
time
and
not
at
another
stimuli
and
susceptibility
may
be
present
in
different
degrees
but
for
the
purpose
of
healthful
reproduction
they
must
not
be
impaired
no
single
class
of
foods
albuminous
starchy
saccharine
or
mineral
is
sufficient
for
the
nutrition
of
the
body
but
the
food
must
contain
substances
belonging
to
each
of
the
different
classes
if
an
animal
be
fed
exclusively
upon
albumen
though
this
substance
constitutes
the
largest
part
of
the
bodily
mass
exhaustion
will
rapidly
follow
since
the
food
does
not
contain
all
the
essential
nutritive
elements
again
when
the
solids
of
the
body
have
been
wasted
they
lose
their
susceptibility
to
stimuli
and
the
food
does
no
good
thus
patients
become
emaciated
during
acute
attacks
of
disease
upon
the
cessation
of
which
they
are
too
feeble
to
recover
simply
because
they
have
lost
the
power
to
digest
and
assimilate
their
food
in
inanimate
bodies
as
in
crystals
forces
come
to
rest
but
the
very
idea
of
life
implies
action
and
continual
change
hence
diversity
of
constitutions
and
different
temperaments
are
essential
in
order
that
marriage
may
result
in
the
reproduction
of
vigorous
beings

and
temperaments
illustration
fig
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
attempted
to
illustrate
the
unique
blending
of
mind
and
body
by
means
of
the
nervous
system
and
we
now
propose
to
exemplify
the
physical
conditions
of
the
organism
by
certain
correspondences
observed
in
the
development
and
conditions
of
that
system
if
nature
answer
to

in
physical
correspondences
she
will
observe
the
same
regularity
in
physical

the
simplest
classification
of
the
temperaments
is
represented
in
fig
not
only
is
mental
activity
dependent
upon
a
vital
activity
in
the
brain
but
the
development
of
the
cerebrum
is
dependent
upon
the
supply
of
blood
the
growth
of
the
intellect
requires
the
same
conditions
that
aided
in
the
development
of
vulcan
right
arm
waste
and
supply
disintegration
and
reparation
of

our
modern
iron
forges
produce
many
an
artisan
whose
great
right
arm
proclaims
him
to
be
a
son
of
power
as
well
as
of
fire
thus
the
fervid
intellect
while
forging
out
its
thoughts
increases
in
size
and
strength
the
difference
between
the
development
of
the
two
is
this
that
the
exercise
of
the
blacksmith
right
arm
quickens
the
activities
of
all
the
bodily
functions
whereas
the
employment
of
the
intellect
does
not
offer
any
healthy
equivalent
physical
exercise
is
a
hygienic
demand
but
intellectual
employment
exerts
no
salutary
influence
on
the
body
while
it
is
constantly
expending
the
nutritive
energies
of
the
blood
the
emotions
likewise
make
exhaustive
draughts
upon
nutrition
to
supply
the
waste
of

as
certainly
as
physical
labor
causes
muscular
change
and

traced
through
four

the

of

his
first
attack
of
mania
occurred
at
sixteen
and
was
followed
by
stupidity
and
finally
ended
in
complete
idiocy
furthermore
there
was
probably
an
extinction
of
the
family
for
the

reproductive
organs
were
as
little
developed
as
those
of
a

twelve
years
of

he
had
two
sisters
who
were
both
defective
physically

morally
and
were
classed
as
imbeciles

complete
the
proof
of
heredity
in
this
case

adds
that
the

had
a
child
while
the
father
was
confined
in
the
asylum
and
that
this
child
exhibited
no
signs
of

statistics
show
that
multitudes
of
human
beings
are
born
with
a
destiny
against
which
they
have
neither
the
will
nor
the
power
to
contend
they
groan
under
the
worst
of
all
tyrannies
the
tyranny
of
a
bad
organization
which
is
theirs
by
inheritance
we
may
represent
the
tendencies
of

while
the
anterior

coincide
with

derangement
unless
counteracted

therefore
evident
that
in
any
organization
upon
which

entailed
a
perverted
or
excessive

of
this

the

if
this

development
we
say
of
such
a
temperament
that
it
is
vital
because
the
functions
of
its
are
favorable
to
evolution
as
degeneration
observes
conditions
so
endurance

conform
to
certain
laws
and
it
is
the
duty
of
all
truthful
inquirers
who
believe
not
only
in
the
progress
of
human
intelligence
but
in
physical
improvement
from
generation
to
generation
to
ascertain
and
comply
with
these
essential
conditions
when
the
anterior
and
middle
lobes
of
the
brain
are
fully
developed
at
their
inferior
surfaces
it
is
regarded
as
an
insane
temperament
containing
the
germs
of
mental
and
bodily
derangement
how
shall
we
distinguish
the
combination
of
organic
elements
if
not
by
the
manner
in
which
they
characterize
the
constitution
every
human
being
is
distinguished
by
natural
peculiarities
both
mental
and
physical
these
are
indicated
not
only
by
the
color
of
the
eyes
hair
and
skin
and
the
mental
expressions
but
in
the
conformation
and
capabilities
of
the
corporeal

the
color

size
and
texture
of
a
leaf
indicate
to
the
expert
pomologist
the
nature
of
the
fruit
which
the
tree
will
bear
but
how
much
more
important
is
it
to
understand
the
harmonies
of
human
development
if
agassiz
could
determine
the
form
and
size
of
a
fish
by
seeing
its
scales

owen
outline
the
skeleton
of
an
unknown
animal
by
viewing
a
portion
of
its
fossil
why
should
not
the
physician
understand
the
language
of
temperaments
since
it
opens
to
him
the
revelations
of
human
development
the

personates
because
there
are
facts
behind
all
these
the
materials
wherewith
to
construct
a

in

there
are
permanent
forces
which
operate
uniformly
thus
revealing
the
order
of
nature
the
temperaments
classified
illustration
fig
we
propose
to
speak
of
four
constitutional
variations
entitled
to
separate
consideration
the
lymphatic
the
sanguine
the
volitive
and
the
encephalic
the
brain
controls
all
the
voluntary
and
modifies
the
involuntary
functions
of
the
body
a
particular
cerebral
development
modifies
the
functions
of
all
the
bodily
organs
and
thus
tempers
the
constitution
we
shall
therefore
base
our
classification
of
temperaments
upon
the
mental
and
physiological
characteristics
which
are
portrayed
by
cerebral
development
such
an
arrangement
is
illustrated
by
fig
the
lymphatic
temperament
the
lymphatic
temperament
predominates
when
the
anterior
base
of
the
brain
and
the
middle
lobe
are
developed
so
as
to
exert
a
preponderating
influence
over
the
bodily
functions
the
character
of
this
influence
we
have
described
in
cerebral
physiology
it
is
difficult
to
state
precisely
the
normal
influences
and
which
arise
from
these
faculties
but
it
is
evident
that
they
are
specially
related
to
nutritive
attraction
in
opposition
to
volitive
repulsion
it
is
only
their
excessive
influence
which
produces
worthless
miserable
morbid
characters
a
constitution
marked
by
this
development
is
indolent
relaxative
and
an
easy
prey
to
epidemics
this
treatment
is
also
characterized
by
a
low
grade
of
vitality
or
resistance
when
life
is
sustained
by
the
volitive
powers
it
is
distinguished
by
a
softness
of
the
bodily
tissues
and
the
prevalence
of
lymph
the
fact
that
all
the
organic
functions
are
performed
indolently
indicates
lack
of
vital
power
an
excellent
illustration
of
this
temperament
is
found
in
fig
which
represents
a
chinese
gentleman
of
distinction
in
the
lower
order
of
animals
as
in
sponges
absorption
is
performed
by
contiguous
cells
which
are
quite
as
effortless
as
in
plants
because
of
their
organic
indolence
sponges
are
often
classed
as
vegetables
a
body
having
an
atonic
or
a
lymphatic
temperament
is
abundantly
supplied
with
absorbent
organs
which
are
very
sluggish
in
their
operations
in
the
lymphatic
temperament
there
seems
to
be
less
constructive
energy
slower
elaboration
and
greater
frugality
lymph
is
a
colorless
or
yellow
fluid
containing
a
large
proportion
of
water
it
is
not
so
highly
organized
as
the
blood
but
resembles
it
when
that
fluid
is
deprived
of
its
red
corpuscles
in
the
sanguine
temperament
circulation
in
the
is
the
most
active
in
the
lacteals
next
and
in
the
lymphatics
the
least
so
but
in
the
lymphatic
temperament
this
order
is
reversed
illustration
fig
powell
has
observed
that
a
lymphatic
man
has
a
large
head
while
a
fat
man
has
a
small
one
and
also
that
fat
and
lymph
are
convertible
one
following
the
other
a
repletion
consisting
of
fat
may
be
removed
and
one
of
lymph
may
replace
it
and
he
could
not
account
for
these
alternations
the
bear
goes
into
his
winter
quarters
sleek
and
fat
and
comes
forth
in
the
spring
just
as
plump
with
lymph
but
he
loses
this
fat
appearance
soon
after
obtaining
food
this
simply
indicates
that
during
lymphatic
activity
the
digestive
organs
are
comparatively
quiescent
but
when
these
are
functionally
employed
again
lymphatic
economy
is
not
required
it
is
the
duty
of
the
lymphatics
to
slowly
convert
the
fat
by
such
transformation
that
when
it
reaches
the
general
circulation
it
may
there
unite
with
other
organic
compounds
the
process
being
aided
by
atmospheric
nitrogen
introduced
during
the
act
of
respiration
in
this
way
it
may
become
changed
into
those
chemically
indefinite
artificial
products
called
proteid
compounds
this
view
is
supported
by
the
disappearance
of
fat
as
an
organized
product
in
the
lymph
of
the
lymphatic
vessels
indicating
that
such
transformation
has
occurred
in
this
way
by
uniting
with
other
organic
compounds
it
appears
that
lymph
may
serve
as
a
weak
basis
for
blood
that
atmospheric
nitrogen
is
also
employed
in
forming
these
artificial
compounds
is
indicated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
sometimes
less
detected
in
arterial
than
in
venous
blood

differs
from

european

being
broader

excellent
representation

morbid
susceptibilities
yet
these
in

are
opposed
by

superior
height

evidently
it

a
observe
the
greater

which
according

great

indolence
morbid

from
the

we
should
say
that

cunning
excitable
treacherous

violently
demonstrative
his
constitution
is
very
susceptible

diseases
of

his

his
love
of

is
strong
syphilitic

will
annihilate
all
these

the
peculiarities
of
this
temperament
are
observed
in
the
diseases
which
characterize
it
it
is
specially
liable
to
derangements
of
digestion
nutrition
and
the

is
easily
poisoned
by
morbid
products
formed
within
the
body
as
well
as
by
those
derived
from

body
of

this
is
seen
in
pyæmia
produced
by
the
introduction
of
decomposing
pus
or
matter
into
the
blood
this
condition
is
most
likely
to
occur

then
the

the
red
corpuscles
diminish

the

becomes
languid
the
pulse
grows
fluttering
and
weak
and
this
increases
until
death
ensues
an
individual
of
this
temperament
is
more
easily
destroyed
than
any
other
by
the
poison
of
syphilis
and
other
contagious
diseases
if
the
blood
has
received
any
hereditary
taint
the
lymphatic
glands
not
only
reproduce
it
but
often
increase
the
virulency
of
the
original
disease
this
temperament
indicates
a
necessity
for
the
employment
of
stimulating
alterative

antiseptic
medicines
the
torpid
functions
need
arousing
the
blood
needs
depuration
the
elimination
of

alteratives
to
produce
these
salutary
changes
the
secretions
need
the
correcting
influence
of
cleansing
remedies
for
the
purification
of
the
blood
persons
of
this
temperament
are
more
liable
to
absorption
of
morbid
products
within
the
body
which
are
in
a
state
of
decomposition
producing
an
infection
of
the

technically
termed
the

results
which
so

are
thus
produced
this
kind
of
poisoning
sometimes
takes
place
from
the
absorption
of
decomposed
exudation
in

and
though
rarely
from

organic
products
collected
in
the
lungs
whenever
the
absorption

more
likely
to
sink
under
acute
attacks
of
disease
especially
alimentary
disorders
such
as
diarrhea
dysentery

it
quickly
succumbs
to
their
prostrating
effects

medicines
the
most
powerful
diffusible

nervous
stimulants
are
required
in
cholera
when
the

is
devastated

development
of
the
basilar
faculties
indicated
by
an
unusual
breadth

its
cerebral
area
includes
the

cerebrum
the
entire
cerebellum

that
part
of
the
medulla
which
connects
with
the

cord
all
of
which
sustain
intimate
relations
to

conditions
accordingly
such
a

indicates
good
digestion
active

vigorous

large

powerful
muscles
and
surplus
vitality
the
violent
faculties
such
as
combativeness
destructiveness

hatred
are
natural
adjuncts
and
their
excess
tends
to
sensuality
and
crime
they
are
not
only
secretive
appropriative
selfish
and
but
when
redundant
are
aggressive
and
tend
to
destructiveness
the
gratification
of
animal
indulgence
intemperance
and
debauchery
the
correspondence
between
the
cerebral
conformation
and
the
physical
development
is
very
obvious
lower
orders
of
animals
possess
these
faculties
and
their
spontaneous
exhibition
is
called
instinct
they
possess
the
acquisitive
destructive
and
propagative
propensities
which
lead
them
to
provide
for
their
wants
and
secure
to
themselves
a
posterity
the
exercise
of
their
bodies
causes
a
continual
waste
which
demands
incessant
reparation
and
they
are
governed
measurably
by
these
animal
impulses
all
of
these
lower
psychical
faculties
have
a
physiological
significance
acquisitiveness
functionally
expresses
assimilation
accretion
animal
growth
and
tends
to
bodily
repletion
secretiveness
expresses
concealing
separating
withdrawing
and
functionally
signifies
secretive
action
secretion
is
the
separating
and
withdrawing
from
the
blood
some
of
its
constituents
as
mucus
bile
saliva

this
latter
process
indicates
complex

unrestrained
selfishness

the
very
essence
of
human
depravity
without
qualification
clearly
it
is
crime
for
blind
devotion
to
the
individual
must
be
in
utter
disregard
for

the
ultimate
tendencies
of
these
faculties
are
therefore
criminal
exaggerate
the
faculty
of
acquisitiveness
and
it
becomes
avariciousness
develop
secretiveness
and
selfishness
and
they
become
cunning
and
profligacy
desperation
and
crime
their
functional
development
tends
to
produce
physical
disorder
and
violent
disease
all
of
these
faculties
are
vehement

a

fell
into

with

billeted
in

was
by
the

with

drawn
sword
the
wife
of
the
carpenter
at
first
trembled
from
fear
and
terror
and
then
suddenly
threw
herself
between

combatants
wrested
the
sword
from
the
soldier
hand
broke
it
in
pieces
and
threw
it
away
during
the
tumult
some
neighbors
and
separated
the
men
while
in
this
state
of
strong
excitement
the
mother
took
up
her
child
from
the
cradle
where
it
lay
playing
and
in
the
most
perfect
health
never
having
had
a
moment
illness
she
gave
it
the
breast
and
in
so
doing
sealed
its
fate
in
a
few
minutes
the
infant
sucking
became
restless
panted
and
sank
dead
upon

bosom
the
physician

instantly
found
the
child
lying
in
the
cradle
as
if
asleep
and
with
its
features
undisturbed
but
all
resources
were
fruitless
it
was
irrecoverably
gone
in
this
interesting
case
the
milk
must
have
undergone
a
change
which
gave
it
a
powerful
sedative
action
upon

susceptible
nervous
system
of

infant
anxiety
irritation

all
tend
to
the
vitiation

time
depravity
of
thought

go
together
degradation
of
mind
and
corruption
of
the

concomitants
there
is
a
very
close
affinity

physical
prostitution

unconscious

many
chronic

a

a
fortunate

hygienic
management
of
the
lymphatic

sanguine
temperaments
consists
in
the
vigorous
toning
of
the

greatly
exempt
it
from

the

frustrate

acute
mania

drive
the
victim

born

doubtless
this
temperament
is
the
source
of
the
reproductive
powers
it
is
the
essential
to
the
foundation
of
all
other
temperaments
it
has
been
supposed
by
some
that
the
cerebellum
is
the
seat
of
sexual
instinct
the
fact
appears
that
an
ample
development
of
the
posterior
base
of
the
cerebrum
and
the
cerebellum
indicates
nutritive
activity
which
is
certainly
a
condition
most
favorable
to
the
display
of
amativeness
in
a
double
sense
then
this
temperament
is
a
vital
one
both
by
nutritive
repletion
and
by
reproduction
it
is
the
and
temperament
causing
growth
to
exceed
waste
and
promptly
repairing
the
wear
which
follows
continual
labor
while
the
sleazy
structures
of
the
lymphatic
temperament
are
favorable
to
the
functions
of
transudation
exhalation
and
mutual
diffusion
of
liquids
the
sanguine
as
its
name
indicates
is
adapted
to
promote
the
circulation
of
the
blood
to
favor
nutrition
and
reproduction
the
former
temperament
does
not
move
the
world
by
its
energies
or
impress
it
vividly
with
its
wisdom

is

line
powell
in
his
work

human
temperaments
announces
the
discovery
of
a
measurement
which
indicates
the
tenacity
of
life
and
the
vital
possessions
of
the
individual
he
has
observed
that
some
persons
of
very
feeble
appearance
possess
remarkable
powers
of
resistance
to
disease
and
continue
to
live
until
the
machinery
of
life
literally
wears
out
others
apparently
stronger
and
more
robust
die
before
the
usual
term
of
life
is
half
completed
he
also
noticed
that
some
families
were
remarkable
for
their
longevity
while
others
reached
only
a
certain
age
less
than
the
average
term
of
life
and
then
died
he
remarked
also
that
some
patients
sank
under
attacks
of
disease
when
to
all
appearances
they
should
recover
and
that
others
recovered
when
according
to
all
reasonable
calculations
they
ought
to
die
he
therefore
not
only
believed
that
the
duration
of
human
life
was
more
definitely
fixed
by
the
organization
than
is
supposed
but
he
set
himself
to
work
to
discover
the
line
of
life
and
the
measure
of
its
duration
he

an

determine
readily

upon

he
requires
a
longer

a
medical
term

originally
to
distinguish
a
temperament
supposed
to
be
characterized
by
a
predominance
of
the
biliary
secretion
in
the
volitive
temperament
the
firm
tenacious
toning

restraining
faculties
rather
than
biliary
secretion

hence
the
necessity
for
administering
large

which
stimulate
the
secretion
of

when
the

we

there
is
moderate

development
lack

to
apply

we
have
treated
the
brain
not
as
a
mass
of
organs
radiating
from
the
medulla
oblongata
as
their
real
center
but
as
two
cerebral
masses
each
of
which
is
developed
around
the
great
ventricle
we
have
freely
applied
an
easy
psychical
and
physiological
nomenclature
to
the
functions
of
its
organs
knowing
that
there
is
no
arbitrary
division
of
them
by
specific
number
for
the
cerebrum
in
an
anatomical
sense
is
a
single
organ
the
doctrine
of
cerebral
unity
is
true
and
the
doctrine
of
its
plurality
of
function
is
true
also
whatever
effect
an
organ
produces
when
acting
in
entire
predominance
is
regarded
as
the
function
of
that
organ
and
is
expressed
by
that
name
although
our
names
and
divisions
are
arbitrary
and
designed
for
convenience
yet
they
facilitate
our
consideration
of
the
psychical
and
their
corresponding
physiological
functions
every
cerebral
manifestation
denotes
a
organ
and
in
proportion
as
these
acts
are
transmitted
to
the
body
it
becomes
a
organ
we
have
ventured
to
repeat
this
proposition
for
the
sake
of
the
reader
that
he
may
be
able
to
distinguish
between
the
two
results
of
the
manifestation
of
one
organ
the
transmission
of
the
influence
of
the
brain
into
the
body
enables
the
former
to
act
physiologically
whereas
if
its
action
were
confined
within
the
cranium
it
would
only
be
psychical
in
the
language
of
buchanan
every
organ
therefore
has
its
mental
and
corporeal
its
psychological
and
physiological
functions
both
usually
manifested
together
capable
of
assuming
the
we
have
already
seen
to
what
degree
the
operates
upon
the
organism
or
how
the
soul
imparts
special
energy
to
single
organs
so
that
they
perform
their
functions
with
more
than
usual
efficiency
and
thus
resist
the
solicitations
of
morbific
agents
doubtless
our
best
thoughts
are
deeply
tinged
by
the
healthful
or
diseased
conditions
of
such
organs
as
the
stomach
the
lungs
the
heart
or
even
the
muscular
or
circulatory
systems
and
these
impressions
when
carried
to
the
sensorium
are
reflected
by
the
thoughts
for
reflex
action
is
the
third
class
of
functions
assigned
to
the
cerebrum
these
reflex
actions
are
either
hygienic
and
remedial
or
morbid
and
pernicious
hence
it
is
philosophical
not
only
to
interpret
the
thoughts
as
physiological
and
pathological
indications
but
to
consider
the
cerebrum
as
exerting
real
hygienic
and
remedial
forces
capable
of
producing
salutary
reparative
and
restorative
effects
when
a
boiler
carries
more
steam
than
can
be
advantageously
employed
it
is
subjected
to
unnecessary
and
injurious
strain
and
is
weakened
thereby
so
when
the
body
is
overtasked
by
excessive
pressure
of
the
volitive
faculties
it
is
prematurely
enfeebled
and
broken
down

francis

very
interesting

in

the

the
great
ptolemy
i
king
of
egypt
had
twelve
descendants
who
successively
became
kings
of
that
country
and
who
were
also
called
ptolemy
they
were
matched
in
and
in
but
in
nearly
every
case
these
near
marriages
were
unprolific
and
the
inheritance
generally
passed
through
other
wives
ptolemy

married
his
niece
and
afterwards
his
sister
ptolemy
iv
married
his
sister
ptolemy
vi
and

were
brothers
and
they
both
consecutively
married
the

also
subsequently
married

ptolemy

of

galton
and
sir
jas
simpson
have
shown
that
many
peerages
have
become
extinct
through
the
evil
results
of
heiresses

usually
only
children
the
feeble
product
of
a
stock
and
statistics
have
shown
that
of
them
bear
no
children
and
fully
never
bear
more
than
one
child
sir
simpson
ascertained
that
out
of
marriages
in
the
british
peerage
were
unfruitful
or
nearly
one
in
every
six
while
out
of
marriages
among
an
agricultural
and
seafaring
population
only
were
sterile
or
barren
or
a
little
less
than
one
in
ten
while
the
marriages
of
persons
closely
related
or
of
similar
temperaments
are
frequently
unfruitful
we
would
not
have
the
reader
understand
that
sterility
or
barrenness
is
usually
the
result
of
such
unions
it
is
most
frequently
due
to
some
deformity
or
diseased
condition
of
the
generative
organs
of
the
female
in
the
latter
part
of
this
work
may
be
found
a
minute
description
of
the
conditions
which
cause
barrenness
together
with
the
methods
of
treatment
which
have
proved
most
effectual
in
the
extensive
practice
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
the
temperaments
may
be
compared
to
a
magnet
like
poles
of
which
repel
and
the
unlike
poles
of
which
attract
each
thus
similarity
of
temperament
results
in
barrenness
while
dissimilarity
makes
the
vital
magnetism
all
the
more
powerful
marriageable
persons
moved
by
some
unknown
influence
have
been
drawn
instinctively
toward
each
other
have
taken
upon
themselves
the
vows
and
obligations
of

and
have
been
fruitful
and
happy
in
this
relation
alliances
founded
upon
position
money
or
purely
arbitrary
considerations
mere
contracts
of
convenience
are
very
apt
to
prove
unhappy
and
unproductive
men
may
unconsciously
obey
strong
instinctive
impulses
without
being
conscious
of
their
existence
and
by
doing
so
avoid
those
ills
which
otherwise
might
destroy
their
connubial
happiness
the
of
marriage
receives
no
consideration
because
the
mind
is
with
newly
awakened
thoughts
and
feelings
lovers
are
charmed
by
certain
harmonies
feel
interior
persuasions
respond
to
a
new
magnetic
influence
and
are
lost
in
an
excess
of
rapture
if
the
parties
to
a
marriage
are
evenly
balanced
in
organic
elements
although
both
of
them
are
vigorous
yet
it
is
physiologically
more
suitable
for
them
to
form
a
nuptial
alliance
with
an
unlike
combination
the
cause
of
the
wretchedness
attending
many
marriages
may
be
traced
to
a
too
great
similarity
of
organization
ideas
taste
education
pursuits
and
association
which
similarity
almost
invariably
terminates
in
domestic
unhappiness
the
husband
and
wife
should
be
as
different
as
the
positive
and
negative
poles
of
a
magnet
when
life
is
begotten
under
these
circumstances
we
may

as
the
very
foundation

our
spiritual
existence
as

object

its

the

lonely

and
yet
withal
there
is
an
unsatisfied
longing
in
the
lover
heart
to
which
neither

respond
the
desire
to
be
loved
hence
the
perfect
peace
of
reciprocated
love
if
its
laws
are
violated
nature
seeks
revenge
in
the
utter
depression
or
prostration
of
the
vital
energies
thus
has
the
divine
engraven
his
command
on
our
very
being
to
love
is
therefore
a
duty
the
fulfillment
of
which
should
engage
our
noblest
powers

defined
this

love
as
condemning
promiscuity

this
sentiment

we
can
not

strongly
urge

imperative
duty
of
teaching
those
youths
who
look
to
them
for
instruction
in
all
matters
which
pertain

such
lessons
as
are
embraced
in
the
chapter
of
this
book
entitled
hygiene
of

reproductive
organs
by
attending
to
such
lessons
as
will
give
the

knowledge
of
the
physiology

hygiene

his
whole
system
the
errors
into

so
many
of

much
of

misery
which

so
often
the

cup
will
be
avoided
masquerading
is
a
modern
accomplishment
girls
wear
tight
shoes
burdensome
skirts
and
corsets
all
of
which
prove
very
injurious
to
their
health
at
the
age
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
our
young
ladies
are
sorry
specimens
of
womankind
and
palpitators
cosmetics
and
all
the
modern
paraphernalia
of

are
required
to
make

appear
fresh

is
equally
to
blame
a
devotee
to
all
the
absurd
devices
of

he
practically
asserts
that
dress
makes
the
man
but
physical
deformities
are
of
far
less
importance
than
moral
imperfections
frankness
is
indispensable
in

should
know

faults

virtues

the

transformed

unloving

the

polygamy
and
monogamy
we
propose
to
give
only
a
brief
dissertation
on
the
principles
and
arguments
of
these
systems
with
special
reference
to
their
representatives
in
the
nineteenth
century
polygamy
has
existed
in
all
ages
it
is
and
always
has
been
the
result
of
moral
degradation
or
wantonness
the
garden
of
eden
was
no
harem
primeval
nature
knew
no
community
of
love
there
was
only
the
union
of
two
and
the
twain
were
made
one
flesh
time
passed
the
sons
of
god
saw
the
daughters
of
men
that
they
were
fair
and
they
took
them
wives
of
all
which
they
chose
the
propensities
of
men
were
in
the
ascendant
and
god
repented
him
that
he
had
created
man
he
directed
noah
to
take
into
the
ark
two
of
every
sort
male
and
female
but
the
imagination
of
man
heart
is
evil
from
his
youth
and
tradition
points
to
polygamy
as
the
generally
recognized
form
of
marriage
among
the
ancients
the
father
of
the
hebrew
nation
was
unquestionably
a
polygamist
and
the
general
history
of
patriarchal
life
shows
that
a
plurality
of
wives
and
concubines
were
national
customs
in
the
earlier
part
of
egyptian
history
menes
is
said
to
have
founded
a
system
of
marriage
ostensibly
monogamous
but
in
reality
it
was
polygamous
because
it
allowed
concubinage
as
civilization
advanced
the
latter
became
unpopular
and
although
lawful
was
uncommon
while
polygamy
was
expressly
forbidden
solomon
according
to
polygamous
principles
with
his
thousand
women
should
have
enjoyed
a
most
felicitous
condition
strange
that
he
exclaimed
a
woman
among
all
these

i
not

according
to
the
distinguished
rabbi
maimonides
polygamy
was
a
jewish
custom
as
late
as
the
thirteenth
century
when
cecrops
the
egyptian
king
came
to
athens
he
introduced
a
new
system
which
proved
to
be
another
step
toward
the
recognition
of
monogamy
under
this
code
a
man
was
permitted
to
have
one
wife
and
a
concubine
here
dawned
the
era
of
grecian
civilization
the
glory
of
which
was
reflected
in
the
social
and
political
principles
of
western
europe
during
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
concubinage
disappeared
but
under
the
new
regime
the
condition
of
the
wife
was
degraded
she
was
regarded
as
simply
an
instrument
of
procreation
and
a
mistress
of
the
household
while
a
class
of
foreign
women
who
devoted
themselves
to
learning
and
the
fine
arts
were
the
admired
and
often
the
beloved
companions
of
the
husbands
these
were
the
courtesans
who
played
the
same
role
in
athenian
history
as
did
the
chaste
matron
in
the
annals
of
rome
when
greece
became
subject
to
rome
and
the
national
characteristics
of
these
nations
were
blended
marriage
became
a
loose
form
of
monogamy
in
persia
during
the
reign
of
cyrus
about
polygamy
was
sustained
by
custom
law
and
religion
the
chinese
marriage
system
was
and
is
practically
polygamous
for
from
their
earliest
traditions
we
learn
that
although
a
man
could
have
but
one
wife
he
was
permitted
to
have
as
many
concubines
as
he
desired
in
the
christian
era
the
first
religious
system
which
incorporated
polygamy
as
a
principle
was
mohammedanism
this
system
which
is
so
admirably
adapted
to
the
voluptuous
character
of
the
orientals
has
penetrated
western
europe
asia
and
africa
hayward
estimated
the
number
of
its
adherents
to
be
one
hundred
and
forty
millions
the
heaven
of
the
mohammedan
is
replete
with
all
the
luxuries
which
appeal
to
the
animal
propensities
ravishing
houris
attend
the
faithful
who
recline
on
downy
couches
in
pavilions
of
pearl
on
the
western
continent
a
system
of
promiscuity
was
practiced
by
the
mexicans
peruvians
brazilians
and
the
barbarous
tribes
of
north
america
the
mormon
church
was
founded
by
joseph
smith
and
professes
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
bible
and
a
special
revelation
to
its
leading
saint
according
to
the
mormon
code
love
is
a
yearning
for
a
higher
state
of
existence
and
the
passions
properly
understood
are
feeders
of
the
spiritual
life
and
again
nature
is
dual
to
complete
his
organization
a
man
must
marry
the
leading
error
of
mormonism
is
that
it
mistakes
a
legal
permission
for
a
divine
command
the
mormon
logic
may
be
premised
as
follows
the
mosaic
law
allowed
polygamy
the
bible
records
it
therefore
the
bible
polygamy
a
mormon
saint
can
have
not
less
than
three
wives
but
as
many
more
as
he
can
conveniently
support
the
eight
fundamental
doctrines
of
the
mormon
church
are
stated
as
follows
god
is
a
person
with
the
flesh
and
form
of
a
man
man
is
a
part
of
the
substance
of
god
and
will
himself
become
a
god
man
is
not
created
by
god
but
existed
from
all
eternity
man
is
not
born
in
sin
and
is
not
accountable
for
offenses
other
than
his
own
the
earth
is
a
colony
of
embodied
spirits
one
of
many
such
settlements
in
space
god
is
president
of
the
immortals
having
under
him
four
orders
of
beings
gods
immortal
beings
possessed
of
a
perfect
organization
of
soul
and
body
being
the
final
state
of
men
who
have
lived
on
earth
in
perfect
obedience
to
the
law
angels
immortal
beings
who
have
lived
on
earth
in
imperfect
obedience
to
the
law
men
immortal
beings
in
whom
a
living
soul
is
united
with
a
human
body
spirits
immortal
beings
still
waiting
to
receive
their
tabernacle
of
flesh
man
being
one
of
the
race
of
gods
became
eligible
by
means
of
marriage
for
a
celestial
throne
and
his
household
of
wives
and
children
are
his
kingdom
not
only
on
earth
but
in
heaven
the
kingdom
of
god
has
been
again
founded
on
earth
and
the
time
has
now
come
for
the
saints
to
take
possession
of
their
own
but
by
virtue
not
by
violence
by
industry
not
by
force
this
sect
has
met
with
stern
and
bitter
opposition
it
was
successively
located
in
new
york
ohio
missouri
and
illinois
from
the
last
of
which
it
was
expelled
by
force
of
arms
and
in
established
in
utah
its
adherents
number
at
the
present
time
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
another
organization
differing
from
the
mormons
in
many
of
its
radical
principles
is
that
of
the
communists
popularly
termed
free
lovers
it
is
located
at
lennox
madison
its
members
advocate
a
system
of
complex
marriage
which
they
claim
is
instituted
with
a
conscientious
regard
for
the
welfare
of
posterity
they
disclaim
promiscuity
and
assert
that
the
tie
which
binds
them
together
is
as
permanent
and
as
sacred
as
that
of
marriage
community
of
property
is
commensurate
with
freedom
of
love
they
define
love
to
be
social
appreciation
and
this
element
in
their
code
of
civilization
which
they
deem
superior
to
all
others
is
secondary
to
bodily
support
the
principles
upon
which
their
social
status
is
founded
may
be
briefly
summarized
as
follows
man
offers
woman
support
and
love
unconditional
woman
enjoying
freedom
health
personal
and
mental
competency
gives
herself
to
man
in
the
boundless
sincerity
of
an
unselfish
union
state
communism
in
this
as
in
all
forms
of
polygamous
marriages
love
is
made
synonymous
with
sexuality
and
its
purely
spiritual
element
is
lost
in
every
instance
this
spiritual
element
should
constitute
the
basis
of
marriage
which
without
it
is
nothing
more
than
legal
prostitution
without
it
the
selfish
degrading
animal
propensities
run
rampant
while
the
emotions
with
all
their
boundless
sweetness
lie
dormant
woman
is
regarded
as
only
a
plaything
to
gratify
the
animal
caprice
that
monogamy
is
a
law
of
nature
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
it
fulfills
the
three
essential
conditions
which
form
the
basis
of
true
marriage
the
development
of
the
individual
the
welfare
of
society
the
reproduction
of
the
species
the
development
of
the
individual
physically
reciprocated
love
produces
a
general
exhilaration
of
the
system
the
elasticity
of
the
muscles
is
increased
the
circulation
is
quickened
and
every
bodily
function
is
stimulated
the
duties
of
life
are
performed
with
a
zest
and
alacrity
never
before
experienced
it
is
not
possible
for
human
beings
to
attain
their
full
stature
of
humanity
except
by
loving
long
and
perfectly
behold
that
venerable
man
he
is
mature
in
judgment
perfect
in
every
action
and
expression
and
saintly
in
goodness
you
almost
worship
as
you
behold
what
rendered
him
thus
perfect
what
rounded
off
his
natural
asperities
and
moulded
up
his
virtues
love
mainly
it
permeated
every
pore
so
to
speak
and
seasoned
every
fiber
of
his
being
as
could
nothing
else
mark
that
matronly
woman
in
the
bosom
of
her
family
she
is
more
than
a
queen
and
goddess
combined
all
her
looks
and
actions
express
the
outflowing
of
some
or
all
of
the
human
virtues
to
know
her
is
to
love
her
she
became
thus
perfect
not
in
a
day
or
a
year
but
by
a
long
series
of
appropriate
efforts
then
by
what
chiefly
in
and
by
love
which
is
specifically
adapted
thus
to
develope
this
maturity
but
all
this
occurs
only
when
there
is
a
normal
exercise
of
the
sexual
propensities
excessive
indulgence
in
marital
pleasures
deadens
all
the
higher
faculties
love
included
and
results
in
an
utter
prostration
of
the
bodily
powers
the
creator
has
endowed
man
and
woman
with
passions
the
suppression
of
which
leads
to
pain
their
gratification
to
pleasure
their
satiety
to
disgust
excessive
marital
indulgence
produces
abnormal
conditions
of
the
generative
organs
and
not
unfrequently
leads
to
incurable
disease
many
cases
of
uterine
disease
are
traceable
to
this
cause
morally
and
intellectually
in
no
country
where
the
polygamous
system
prevails
do
we
find
a
code
of
political
and
social
ethics
which
recognizes
the
rights
and
claims
of
the
individual
the
condition
of
woman
is
that
of
the
basest
slave
a
slave
to
the
caprice
and
tyranny
of
her
master
communism
raises
her
from
the
slough
of
slavery
but
subjects
her
to
the
level
of
prostitution
an
inevitable
sequence
of
polygamy
is
a
decline
of
literature
and
science
the
natural
tendency
of
each
system
is
to
the
blood
is
diverted
from
its
normal
channels
and
the
result
is
a
condition
which
may
be
appropriately
termed
sensualism
is
in
its
very
nature
directly
opposed
to
literary
attainments
or
advancement
happily
there
is
a
golden
mean
an
equalization
of
those
elements
which
constitutes
the
acme
of
individual
enjoyment
the
welfare
of
society
the
general
law
of
ethics
that
whatever
is
beneficial
to
the
individual
contributed
to
the
highest
good
of
society
and
applies
with
equal
force
to
the
hygienic
conditions
of
marriage
each
family
like
the
ancient
roman
household
is
the
prototype
of
the
natural
government
under
which
it
lives
wherever
the
marriage
relation
is
regarded
as
sacred
there
you
will
find
men
of
pure
hearts
and
noble
lives
of
all
foreign
nations
the
germans
are
celebrated
for
their
sacred
regard
of
woman
and
the
duties
of
marriage
and
all
scholars
from
the
age
of
tacitus
to
the
present
day
have
concurred
in
attributing
the
elevation
of
woman
to
the
teutons
in
america
the
law
recognizes
only
monogamy
but
domestic
unhappiness
is
a
prominent
feature
of
our
national
life
therefore
argues
the
monogamy
does
not
accord
with
the
best
interests
of
mankind
the
fallacy
lies
in
the
first
premise
legally
our
marriage
system
is
monogamous
but
and
it
is
prostitution
is
the
source
of
this
domestic
infelicity
the
mistress
sips
the
sweet
nectar
that
is
denied
to
the
deceived
wife
legislators
have
battled
with
intemperance
but
have
done
comparatively
little
to
banish
from
our
midst
this
necessary
evil
they
recoil
with
disgust
from
this
abyss
of
iniquity
and
disease
within
it
is
coiled
a
monster
which
invades
our
hearthstones
contaminates
our
social
atmosphere
and
whose
very
breath
is
laden
with
poisonous
vapors
the
inexhaustible
source
of
all
evil
the
perverted
appetites
of
mankind
are
mistaken
for
the
natural
desires
and
necessities
of
our
being
and
accordingly
various
arguments
have
been
advanced
to
prove
that
monogamy
is
not
conducive
to
social
developement
it
is
curious
that
no
one
of
these
arguments
refers
to
the
health
and
of
the
thus
overlooking
perhaps
willfully
the
great
law
of
social
economy
even
a
few
medical
writers
sometimes
advocate
the
principles
of
this
liberalism
in
a
recently
published
work
there
are
enumerated
only
demerits
of
polygamy
and
of
monogamy
these
six
demerits
which
the
author
is
pleased
to
term
a
bombshell
he
introduces
on
account
of
his
moral
convictions
no
less
than
humanitarian
considerations
the
same
author
terms
monogamy
a
and
tree
the
worm
that
is
devastating
the
fairest
tree
of
eden
and
draining
its
richest
juices
is
what
our
contemporary
thinks
may
be
termed
a
necessary
it
is
claimed
that
monogamy
begets
narrow
sympathies
and
leads
to
selfish
idolatry
the
fallacy
of
this
argument
lies
in
the
misapprehension
of
the
term
is
literally
selfishness
yet
who
will
deny
that
it
is
a
paramount
duty
of
man
if
perverted
it
may
be
vicious
even
criminal
but
selfishness
in
so
far
as
it
is
generated
by
monogamy
is
one
of
the
chief
elements
of
social
economy
furthermore
it
favors
the
observance
of
the
laws
of
sexual
hygiene
as
we
have
said
elsewhere
true
love
and
correspondingly
expands
and
develops
the
sympathies
selfish
idolatry
is
preferable
to
social
neglect
this
argument
will
not
bear
a
critical
examination
for
it
is
asserted
that
in
a
happy
union
love
is
so
exclusive
that
there
is
hardly
a
liking
for
good
neighbors
and
scarcely
any
love
at
all
for
god
if
the
good
neighbors
were
equally
blessed
they
would
not
suffer
from
this
exclusiveness
and
it
is
practically
true
that
there
is
no
higher
incentive
to
love
and
obey
our
maker
than
the
blessing
of
a
happy
marriage
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
the
third
essential
object
of
marriage
is
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
the
desire
for
offspring
is
innate
in
the
heart
of
every
true
man
or
woman
it
is
thus
a
law
of
our
nature
and
as
such
must
have
its
legitimate
sphere
the
essential
features
of
reproduction
proclaim
monogamy
to
be
the
true
method
of
procreation
promiscuity
would
render
the
mother
unable
to
designate
the
father
of
her
children
among
lower
animals
pairing
is
an
instinctive
law
whenever
the
female
is
incapable
of
protecting
and
nourishing
her
offspring
alone
during
at
least
fifteen
years
the
child
is
dependent
for
food
and
clothing
upon
its
parents
to
say
nothing
of
the
requisite
moral
training
and
loving
sympathy
which
in
a
great
measure
mould
its
character
fidelity
to
one
promotes
multiplication
it
has
been
argued
by
the
advocates
of
polygamy
that
such
a
system
interferes
with
woman
natural
right
to
maternity
of
the
many
marriages
celebrated
yearly
comparatively
few
are
sterile
the
statement
that
many
single
women
are
desirous
of
having
children
would
apply
only
to
a
very
limited
number
as
it
is
seldom
that
they
would
be
able
to
support
children
without
the
aid
and
assistance
of
a
father
promiscuity
diminishes
the
number
and
the
quality
of
the
human
products
women
of
pleasure
never
give
to
the
world
sons
of
genius
or
daughters
of
moral
purity
chapter

reproduction
every
individual
derives
existence
from
a
which
word
literally
means
one
who
brings
forth
we
restrict
the
meaning
of
the
term
ordinarily
to
that
function
by
which
living
bodies
produce
other
living
bodies
similar
to
themselves
means
to
bring
forth
the
producing
again
or
renewing
to
protract
individual
existence
nutrition
is
necessary
because
all
vital
changes
are
attended
by
and
nutrition
is
always
engaged
in
the
work
of
reparation
every
organism
that
starts
out
upon
its
career
of
development
depends
upon
nourishing
materials
for
its
growth
and
upon
this
renewing
process
for
its
development
nutrition
is
all
the
while
necessary
to
prolong
the
life
of
the
individual
but
at
length
its
vigor
wanes
its
functions
languish
and
finally
the
light
of
earthly
life
goes
out
although
the
single
organization
decays
and
passes
away
nevertheless
the
species
is
uninterruptedly
continued
the
tidal
wave
of
life
surges
higher
on
the
shores
of
time
for
reproduction
is
as
constant
and
stable
as
the
attractive
forces
of
the
planetary
system
it
is
a
fact
that
many
species
of
the
lower
order
of
animals
which
once
existed
are
now
extinct
it
has
been
asserted
and
denied
that
fossil
remains
of
man
have
been
found
indicating
that
races
which
once
existed
have
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
the
pyramids
are
unfolding
a
wonderful
history
embracing
a
period
of
hundred
years
which
the
world
of
science
receives
as
literally
authentic
and
admits
also
that
hundred
years
are
as
correctly
accounted
for
the
extinction
of
races
is
not
at
all
improbable
at
the
present
time
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
this
continent
seem
to
be
surely
undergoing
gradual
extinguishment
it
therefore
seems
to
be
possible
for
a
weaker
race
to
deteriorate
and
finally
become
extinct
unless
the
causes
of
their
decadence
can
be
discovered
and
remedied
all
people
are
admonished
to
earnestly
investigate
the
essential
conditions
necessary
for
their
continuance
for
the
rise
and
fall
of
nations
is
in
obedience
to
natural
principles
and
operations
viewed
from
this
standpoint
it
is
possible
that
a
careful
study
of
the
human
temperaments
and
their
relations
to
reproduction
may
be
of
greater
moment
than
has
hitherto
been
supposed
and
a
proper
understanding
of
them
may
tend
to
avert
that
individual
deterioration
which
if
suffered
to
become
general
would
end
in
national
disaster
and
the
extinction
of
the
race
until
recently
even
naturalists
believed
that
descendants
were
strictly
like
their
parents
in
form
and
structure
now
it
is
known
that
the
progeny
may
differ
in

refer
those

may
desire

themselves
further
acquainted
with
this
interesting
subject
to
the
standard
physiological
works
of
flint
foster

bennett
dalton
and
others
equally
eminent
in
this
particular
branch
of
science
certain
theories
have
been
advanced
concerning
conditions
which
may
influence
the
sex
of
the
offspring
one
is
that
the
right
ovary
furnishes
the
germs
for
males
the
left
for
females
that
the
right
testicle
furnishes
sperm
capable
of
fecundating
the
germs
of
males
and
the
left
testicle
the
germs
of
the
left
ovary
for
females
that
fecundation
sometimes
takes
place
from
right
to
left
and
thus
produces
these
abnormal
variations
we
merely
state
the
hypothesis
but
do
not
regard
it
as
accounting
for
the
distinction
of
sex
or
as
causing
monstrosities
though
it
is
somewhat
plausible
as
a
theory
and
is
not
easily
disproved
in
the
lower
order
of
animals
as
sheep
and
swine
one
of
the
testicles
has
been
removed
and
there
resulted
afterward
both
male
and
female
progeny
so
that
the
theory
seems
to
lack
facts
for
a
foundation
we
sometimes
witness
in
the
child
excessive
development
as
five
fingers
a
large
cranium
which
results
in
dropsical
effusion
or
deficient
brain
as
in
idiots
sometimes
a
hand
or
arm
is
lacking
or
possibly
there
is
a
dual
connection
as
in
the
case
of
the
siamese
twins
or
two
heads
united
on
one
body
it
is
difficult
to
give
any
satisfactory
explanation
of
these
abnormal
developments
from
age
to
age
the
type
is
and
preserves
a
the
crossings
of
the
races
are
only
transient
deviations
not
capable
of
perpetuation
and
quickly
return
again
to
the
original
stock
this
force
is
persistent
for
inasmuch
as
the
individual
represents
the
race
so
does
his
offspring
represent
the
parental
characteristics
in
tastes
proclivities
and
morals
as
well
as
in
organic
resemblances
this
constancy
is
unaccountable
and
more
mysterious
than
the
occasional
malformation
of
germs
in
the
early
period
of
foetal
life
if
to
every
deviation
from
that
original
form
and
structure
which
gives
character
to
the
productions
of
nature
we
apply
the
term
we
shall
find
but
very
few
and
from
this
whole
class
there
will
be
a
very
small
number
indeed
of
malformations
if
the
sexes
be
deprived
of
the
generative
organs

approach
each
other

all

who
are
partly

a

distinguished
by
sexual
characteristics
the

conjunction
of

a
very
familiar
illustration
of

mode
is
found

as

germs

influenced

indicate

rule

sexual
reproduction

farmer
understands
that

wishes

materially
improve

be
begotten
by

purer
breed

all

physiological
fact
that
while
the
growth

development
of
the
individual
are
rapidly
progressing
the
reproductive
powers
remain
almost
inactive

that
the

indicates
an
arrest

in

contributes

generally

impairs
our

plainly
has

very
different

has
made
these

nature
expresses
the
intention

by
giving
to
plants

distinctive
organs
for
this
purpose
these
are
endowed
with
exquisite
sensibility
so
that
their
proper
exercise
produces
enjoyment

excessive
sexual
indulgence
not
only
prostrates
the
nervous

enfeebles
the

and
drains
the
blood
of
its
vivifying
elements
but
is
inconsistent
with
intellectual
activity
morality
and
spiritual
development
the
most
entrancing
delights
and
consummate
enjoyments
are
of
the
emotive
order
ideal
abstract
and
pure
so
inspiring
that
they
overpower
the
grosser
sensual
pleasures
and
diffuse
their
own
sweet
chastity
and
refining
influence
over
all
the
processes
of
life
hence
the
gratification
of
the
sexual
instincts
should
always
be
moderate
it
should
be
regulated
by
the
judgment
and
will
and
kept
within
the
bounds
of
health
no
person
has
a
moral
right
to
carry
this
indulgence
so
far
as
to
produce
injurious
consequences
to
either
party
and
he
who
can
not
refrain
from
it
is
in
no

condition
to

in
all

there

the

the

ovulation
the
are
those
essential
parts
of
the
generative
system
of
the
human
female
in
which
the
ova
are
matured
there
are
two
ovaries
one
on
each
side
of
the
uterus
and
connected
with
it
by
the
fallopian
tubes
they
are
ovoidal
bodies
about
an
inch
in
diameter
and
furnish
the
or
ovules
these
latter
are
very
minute
seldom
measuring
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
frequently
are
not
more
than
half
that
size
the
ovaries
develop
with
the
growth
of
the
female
so
that
finally
at
the
pubescent
period
they
ripen
and
liberate
an
ovum
or
germ
vesicle
which
is
carried
into
the
uterine
cavity
through
the
fallopian
tubes
with
the
aid
of
the
microscope
we
find
that
these
ova
are
composed
of
granular
substance
in
which
is
found
a
miniature
yolk
surrounded
by
a
transparent
membrane
called
the
this
yolk
contains
a
germinal
vesicle
in
which
can
be
discovered
a
nucleus
called

the
process
of
the
growth
of
the
ovaries
is
very
gradual
and
their
function
of
ripening
and
discharging
an
ovum
every
month
into
the
fallopian
tubes
and

is
not
developed
until
between
the
twelfth
and
fifteenth
years

in

a
conscious
completeness
for
those
relations
of

for
which
this
function
prepares
them
the
period
of
puberty
is
also
indicated
by
menstruation
the
catamenial
discharge
naturally
follows
the
ripening
and
liberation
of
an
ovum
and
as
the
ovaries
furnish
one
of
these
each
month
this
monthly
flow
is
termed
the
the
plural
of
the
latin
word
which
signifies
a
month
the
menstrual
flow
continues
from
three
to
five
days
and
is
merely
the
exudation
of
ordinary
venous
blood
through
the
mucous
lining
of
the
cavity
of
the
uterus
at
this
time
the
nervous
system
of
females
is
much
more
sensitive
and
from
the
fact
that
there
is
greater
aptitude
to
conception
immediately
before
and
after
this
period
it
is
supposed
that
the
sexual
feeling
is
then
the
strongest
when
impregnation
occurs
immediately
before
the
appearance
of
the
menses
their
duration
is
generally
shortened
but
not
sufficiently
to
establish
the
suspicion
that
conception
has
taken
place
the
germ
is
the
contribution
of
the
female
which
provides
the
conditions
which
only
require
the
vivifying
principle
of
the
sperm
for
the
development
of
another
being
the
period
of
aptitude
for
conception
terminates
at
the
time
both
ovulation
and
menstruation
cease
which
unless
brought
about
earlier
by
disease
usually
occurs
about
the
year
of
her
age
fecundation
since
in
the
beginning
god
created
male
and
female
and
said
unto
them
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
it
is
evident
that
what
was
originated
by
creation
must
be
continued
by
procreation
the
process
of
generation
the
reader
will
find
described
on
pages
and
then
commences
a
wonderful
series
of
transforming
operations
rudimentary
changes
preliminary
to
the
formation
of
tissues
structures
and
functions
which
finally
qualify
the
organism
for
independent
existence
the
ovum
when
expelled
from
the
ovary
enters
the
fimbriated
or
extremity
of
the
fallopian
tube
to
commence
at
once
its
descent
to
the
uterus
the
process
of
passing
through
this
minute
tube
varies
in
different
animals
in
birds
and
reptiles
the
bulk
of
the
expelled
ova
is
so
great
as
to
completely
fill
up
the
tube
and
it
is
assisted
in
its
downward
course
partly
by
its
own
weight
and
partly
by
the
peristaltic
action
of
the
muscular
coat
of
the
canal
in
the
human
subject
however
the
ova
are
so
minute
that
nature
has
supplied
a
special
agent
for
their
direct
transmission
otherwise
they
might
be
retained
and
not
reach
their
destination
accordingly
the
fimbriated
extremity
of
the
fallopian
tubes
which
is
nearest
to
the
ovaries
and
consequently
from
the
ovary
first
receives
the
ovum
when
expelled
is
provided
with
a
series
of
small
hairs
termed
forming
the
lining
or
basement
membrane
of
the
tubes
and
the
movements
of
these
cilia
being
towards
the
uterus
transmit
by
their
vibrating
motion
the
ovum
from
the
ovary
through
the
fallopian
tubes
to
the
uterus
the
mature
ovum
however
is
not
by
itself
capable
of
being
converted
into
the
embryo
it
requires
fecundation
by
the
spermatic
fluid
of
the
male
and
this
may
take
place
immediately
on
the
expulsion
of
the
ovum
from
the
ovary
or
during
its
passage
through
the
fallopian
tube
or
according
to
bischoff
coste
and
others
in
the
cavity
of
the
uterus
or
even
upon
the
surface
of
the
ovary
should
impregnation
however
fail
the
ovum
gradually
loses
its
vitality
and
is
eventually
expelled
by
the
uterine
secretions
it
occasionally
happens
that
the
descent
of
the
impregnated
ovum
is
arrested
and
the
formation
of
the
embryo
commences
in
the
ovary
this
is
termed
or
again
the
ovum
may
be
arrested
in
its
passage
through
the
fallopian
tube
causing
what
is
termed
or
after
it
has
been
expelled
from
the
ovary
it
may
fail
to
be
received
by
the
fimbriated
extremity
and
escape
into
the
cavity
of
the
abdomen
forming
what
has
been
termed
if
the
microscopic
germ
lodges
in
some
slight
interstice
of
fiber
during
its
passage
through
the
walls
of
the
uterus
it
may
be
detained
long
enough
to
fix
itself
there
and
when
this
occurs
it
is
termed
all
these
instances
of
pregnancy
may
necessitate
the
employment
of
surgical
skill
in
order
that
they
may
terminate
with
safety
to
the
mother
their
occurrence
however
is
very
rare
the
intense
nervous
excitement
produced
by
the
act
of
coition
is
immediately
followed
by
a
corresponding
degree
of
depression
and
a
too
frequent
repetition
of
it
is
necessarily
injurious
to
health
the
secretions
of
the
seminal
fluid
being
like
other
secretions
chiefly
under
the
influence
of
the
nervous
system
an
expenditure
of
them
requires
a
corresponding
renewal
this
renewal
greatly
taxes
the
corporeal
powers
inducing
lassitude
nervousness
and
debility
it
is
a
well
known
fact
that
the
highest
degree
of
mental
and
bodily
vigor
is
inconsistent
with
more
than
a
moderate
indulgence
in
sexual
intercourse
to
ensure
strength
symmetry
and
high
intellectual
culture
in
the
human
race
requires
considerable
care
consideration
should
be
exercised
in
the
choice
of
a
companion
for
life
constitutional
as
well
as
hereditary
ailments
demand
our
closest
attention
age
has
also
its
judicious
barriers
as
before
stated
when
reproduction
commences
growth
as
a
rule
ceases
therefore
it
is
inexpedient
that
matrimony
should
be
consummated
before
the
parties
have
arrived
at
mature
stature
prevention
of
conception
much
has
been
written
upon
the
question
whether
married
people
have
a
right
to
decline
the
responsibilities
of
wedlock
the
practice
of
inducing
abortion
is
not
only
immoral
but
criminal
because
it
is
destructive
to
both
the
health
of
the
mother
and
the
life
of
the
embryo
being
if
both
the
parties
to
a
marriage
be
feeble
or
if
they
be
not
temperamentally
adapted
to
each
other
so
that
their
children
would
be
deformed
insane
or
idiotic
then
to
beget
offspring
would
be
a
flagrant
wrong
if
the
mother
is
already
delicate
possessing
feeble
constitutional
powers
she
is
inadequate
to
the
duties
of
maternity
it
is
not
right
to
lay
such
burdens
upon
is
the
first
law
of
nature
which
all
ought
to
respect
the
woman
may
be
able
to
discharge
the
duties
of
a
loving
wife
and
companion
when
she
can
not
fulfill
those
of
if
the
husband
love
his
wife
as
he
ought
he
will
resign
all
the
pleasure
necessary
to
secure
her
exemption
from
the
condition
of
maternity
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
a
great
wickedness
unpardonable
even
to
be
so
reckless
of
consequences
and
so
devoid
of
all
feeling
as
to
expose
a
frail
feeble
affectionate
woman
to
those
perils
which
almost
insure
her
death
to
enforce
pregnancy
under
such
circumstances
is
a
crime
every
true
man
therefore
should
rather
practice
and
forbearance
than
entail
on
his
wife
such
certain
misery
if
not
danger
to
life
undoubtedly
the
trial
is
great
but
if
a
sacrifice
be
required
let
the
husband
forbear
the
gratification
of
passions
which
will
assuredly
be
the
means
of
developing
in
his
delicate
wife
symptoms
that
may
speedily
hurry
her
into
a
premature
grave
before
she
has
recovered
from
the
effects
of
bearing
nursing
and
rearing
one
child
ere
she
has
regained
proper
tone
and
vigor
of
body
and
mind
she
is
unexpectedly
overtaken
by
the
manifestation
of
symptoms
which
again
indicate
pregnancy
children
thus
begotten
are
not
apt
to
be
hardy
and
from
the
love
that
parents
feel
for
their
posterity
from
their
wishes
for
their
success
from
their
hopes
that
they
may
be
useful
from
every
consideration
for
their
future
let
them
exercise
precaution
and
forbearance
until
the
wife
becomes
sufficiently
healthy
and
enduring
to
bequeath
her
own
vital
stamina
to
the
child
she
bears
from
what
has
been
said
on
this
subject
it
behooves
the
prudent
husband
to
weigh
well
the
injurious
nay
criminal
results
which
may
follow
his
lust
let
him
not
endanger
the
health
and
it
may
be
the
life
of
his
loving
and
confiding
wife
through
a
lack
of

him
altogether
refrain
rather
than
be
the
means
of
untold
misery
and
perhaps
the
destruction
of
the
person
demanding
his
most
cherished
love
and
protection
on
so
important
a
subject
we
feel
we
should
commit
an
unpardonable
wrong
were
we
not
to
speak
thus
plainly
and
openly
an
opportunity
has
been
afforded
us
which
it
would
be
reprehensible
to
neglect
we
shall
indeed
feel
we
have
been
amply
rewarded
if
these
suggestive
remarks
of
ours
tend
in
any
way
to
remove
or
alleviate
the
sufferings
of
an
uncomplaining
and
loving
wife
our
sympathies
always
susceptible
to
the
conditions
of
sorrow
and
suffering
have
been
enlisted
to
give
faithfully
explicitly
and
plainly
warnings
of
danger
and
exhortations
to
prudence
and
nothing
remains
for
us
but
to
maintain
the
principles
of
morality
and
leave
to
the
disposal
of
a
wise
and
overruling
providence
the
mystery
of
all
seemingly
untoward
events
in
every
condition
of
life
evils
arise
and
most
of
those
which
are
encountered
are
avoidable
humanity
should
be
held
accountable
for
those
evils
which
it
might
but
does
not
shun
by
a
statute
of
the
national
government
prevention
of
pregnancy
is
considered
a
punishable
offense
whereas
every
physician
is
instructed
by
our
standard
writers
and
lecturers
on
this
subject
that
not
only
prevention
is
necessary
in
many
instances
but
even
abortion
must
sometimes
be
produced
in
order
to
save
the
mother
life
as
we
view
the
matter
the
law
of
the
national
government
asserts
the
ruling
principle
and
the
exceptions
to
it
must
be
well
established
by
evidence
in
order
to
fully
justify
such
procedure
the
family
physician
may
with
the
concurrence
of
other
medical
counselors
be
justified
in
rare
cases
in
advising
means
for
the
prevention
of
conception
but
he
should
exercise
this
professional
duty
when
the
responsibility
is
shared
by
other
members
of
the
profession
and
the
circumstances
fully
and
clearly
warrant
such
a
practice
after
fecundation
the
length
of
time
before
conception
takes
place
is
variously
estimated
should
impregnation
occur
at
the
ovary
or
within
the
fallopian
tubes
usually
about
a
week
elapses
before
the
fertilized
germ
enters
the
uterus
so
that
ordinarily
the
interval
between
the
act
of
insemination
and
that
of
conception
varies
from
eight
to
fourteen
days
double
conception
if
two
germs
be
evolved
simultaneously
each
may
be
impregnated
by
spermatozoa
and
a
twin
pregnancy
be
the
result
this
is
by
no
means
a
rare
occurrence
it
is
very
unusual
however
to
have
one
birth
followed
by
another
after
an
interval
of
three
or
four
months
and
each
babe
present
the
evidences
of
full
maturity
perhaps
such
occurrences
may
be
accounted
for
on
the
supposition
that
the
same
interval
of
time
elapses
between
the
impregnation
of
the
two
germs
as
there
is
difference
observed
in
their
birth
that
after
the
act
of
insemination
sperm
was
carried
to
each
ovary
that
one
had
matured
a
germ
ready
for
fecundation
then
impregnation
and
conception
immediately
followed
and
the
decidua
of
the
uterus
hermetically
sealed
both
fallopian
tubes
and
thus
securely
retained
the
sperm
within
the
other
fallopian
canal
the
stimulus
of
the
sperm
so
pent
up
causes
that
ovary
to
mature
a
germ
although
it
may
do
so
slowly
and
after
two
or
three
months
it
is
perfected
fertilized
and
a
second
conception
occurs
within
the
uterus
if
each
embryo
observe
a
regular
period
of
growth
and
each
be
born
at
maturity
there
must
be
an
interval
of
two
or
three
months
between
their
births
but
it
is
far
more
common
for
the
parturition
of
the
first
displaying
signs
of
full
maturity
to
coincide
with
the
birth
of
a
second
which
is
immature
and
which
can
not
sustain
respiratory
life
the
birth
of
the
latter
is
brought
about
prematurely
by
the
action
of
the
uterus
in
expelling
the
matured
child
uterine
pregnancy
there
are
many
who
manifest
a
laudable
desire
to
understand
the
physiology
of
conception
the
changes
which
take
place
and
the
order
of
their
natural
occurrence
when
impregnation
takes
place
at
the
ovaries
or
within
the
fallopian
tubes
there
is
exuded
upon
the
inner
surface
of
the
womb
a
peculiar
nutritious
substance
it
flows
out
of
the
minute
porous
openings
surrounding
the
termination
of
the
fallopian
tube
within
the
uterine
cavity
and
thus
is
in
readiness
to
receive
the
germ
and
retain
it
there
until
it
becomes
attached
undoubtedly
the
germ
imbibes
materials
from
this
matter
for
its
nurture
and
growth
this
membranous
substance
is
termed
the
and
disappears
after
conception
is
insured
two
membranes
form
around
the
embryo
the
inner
one
is
called
the
the
outer
one
the
both
serve
for
the
protection
of
the
embryo
and
the
inner
one
contains
the
amnii
in
which
it
floats
during
life
immediately
after
conception
the
small
glands
in
the
neck
of
the
uterus
usually
throw
out
a
sticky
secretion
filling
the
canal
or
uniting
its
sides
so
that
nothing
can
enter
or
leave
the
uterine
cavity
the
fertilized
ovum
rapidly
develops
after
its
conception
it
imbibes
nourishment
and
there
is
a
disposition
in
fluids
to
pass
into
it
through
its
membranes
if
this
process
is
not
involuntary
it
is
at
all
events
at
the
convenience
and
use
of
the
developing
germ
after
three
months
the
embryo
is
termed
the
its
fluids
are
then
so
much
more
highly
organized
that
some
of
them
are
tinged
with
sanguine
hues
and
thenceforward
acquire
the
characteristics
of
red
blood
out
of
red
blood
are
formed
and
from
the
incipient
development
of
the
heart
follow
faint
lines
of
arteries
and
the
engineers
of
nutrition
survey
a
circulatory
system
perfecting
the
vascular
connections
by
supplementing
the
arteries
with
a
complete
of
veins
and
capillaries
the
placenta
or
afterbirth
whenever
conception
occurs
a
soft
spongy
substance
is
formed
between
the
uterus
and
the
growing
ovum
called
the
it
is
composed
of
membrane
cellular
tissue
and
connecting
filaments
the
principal
use
of
this
organ
seems
to
be
to
decarbonate
the
blood
of
the
foetus
and
to
supply
it
with
oxygen
it
performs
the
same
function
for
the
foetus
that
the
lungs
do
for
the
organism
after
birth
it
allows
the
blood
of
the
foetus
to
come
into
very
close
contact
with
that
of
the
mother
from
which
it
receives
a
supply
of
oxygen
and
to
which
it
gives
up
carbonic
acid
this
interchange
of
gases
takes
place
in
the
placenta
or
between
it
and
the
uterus
through
the
intervening
membranes
this
decarbonating
function
requires
the
agency
of
the
maternal
lungs
for
the
purpose
of
oxygenating
the
mother
blood
the
placenta
is
attached
to
the
uterus
by
simple
adhesion
true
in
some
instances
morbid
adhesion
takes
place
or
a
growing
together
in
consequence
of
inflammation
but
the
natural
junction
is
one
merely
of
contact
the
membranes
of
the
placenta
spreading
out
upon
the
cavity
of
the
uterus
so
that
finally
the
former
may
be
entirely
removed
without
a
particle
of
disturbance
or
injury
to
the
latter
formerly
it
was
supposed
that
the
placental
vessels
penetrated
into
the
substance
of
the
uterus
we
know
now
there
is
no
such
continuation
of
the
vessels
of
the
one
into
the
other
the
decarbonation
of
the
blood
requires
the
placental
and
uterine
membranes
to
be
in
contact
with
each
other
if
the
union
were
vascular
the
mother
blood
would
circulate
in
the
foetal
body
and
the
impulses
of
the
maternal
heart
might
prove
too
strong
for
the
delicate
organism
of
the
embryo
besides
the
separation
of
the
placenta
from
the
uterus
might
prove
fatal
to
both
parent
and
offspring
the
placenta
is
only
a
temporary
organ
and
when
its
functions
are
no
longer
required
it
is
easily
and
safely
removed
the
umbilical
cord
the
foetal
blood
is
transmitted
to
and
fro
between
the
body
of
the
child
and
the
placenta
by
a
cord
which
contains
two
arteries
and
one
vein
this
is
called
the
because
it
enters
the
body
at
the
middle
of
the
abdominal
region
or
it
is
composed
also
of
its
own
proper
membranous
sheath
or
skin
and
cellular
tissues
besides
the
two
months
after
pregnancy
this
cord
can
be
seen
when
it
commences
to
grow
rapidly
quickening
not
until
the
mother
feels
motion
is
she
said
to
be
quick
with
child
that
is
the
child
must
be
old
and
strong
enough
to
communicate
a
physical
impulse
which
the
mother
can
distinctly
perceive
before
it
is
regarded
as
having
received
life
this
is
a
fallacy
for
the
germ
has
to
be
endowed
with
life
before
organization
can
begin
the
act
of
impregnation
communicates
the
vital
principle
and
from
that
moment
it
starts
upon
its
career
of
development
a
long
period
elapses
after
this
occurs
before
it
can
make
the
mother
feel
its
motions
before
quickening
the
attempt
to
destroy
the
foetus
is
not
considered
so
grave
a
crime
by
our
laws
but
after
this
quickening
takes
place
it
is
deemed
a
felony
the
right
to
terminate
pregnancy
the
expediency
and
the
moral
right
to
prematurely
terminate
pregnancy
must
be
admitted
when
weighty
and
sufficient
reasons
for
it
exist
such
a
course
should
never
be
undertaken
however
without
the
advice
and
approval
of
the
family
physician
and
whenever
it
is
possible
the
counsel
of
another
medical
practitioner
should
be
obtained
there
may
be
so
great
a
malformation
of
the
pelvic
bones
as
to
preclude
delivery
at
full
term
or
as
in
some
instances
the
pregnant
condition
may
endanger
the
life
of
the
mother
because
she
is
not
able
to
retain
nourishment
upon
the
stomach
in
such
cases
only
is
interference
warranted
and
even
then
the
advice
of
some
physician
should
be
first
obtained
to
make
sure
that
the
life
of
the
mother
is
endangered
before
so
extreme
a
measure
is
resorted
to
those
who
are
qualified
for
maternal
duties
should
not
undertake
to
defeat
the
intentions
of
nature
simply
because
they
love
ease
and
dislike
responsibility
such
persons
may
be
considered
genteel
ladies
but
practically
they
are
indifferent
to
the
claims
of
society
and
posterity
how
such
selfishness
contrasts
with
the
glorious
heroic
spartan
spirit
of
the
young
woman
who
consulted
us
in
reference
to
the
acceptance
of
a
tempting
offer
of
marriage
she
was
below
medium
size
and
delicately
organized
she
hesitated
in
her
answer
because
she
was
uncertain
as
to
her
duty
to
herself
and
to
her
proposed
husband
and
on
account
of
the
prospective
contingencies
of
matrimony
after
she
was
told
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
she
could
discharge
the
obligations
of
maternity
with
safety
to
herself
and
yet
that
she
might
prove
to
her
intended
husband
a
true
and
valuable
wife
she
quickly
answered
her
black
eyes
radiant
with
the
high
purpose
of
her
soul
if
i
assent
to
this
offer
i
shall
accept
the
condition
and
its
consequences
also
even
if
pregnancy
be
my
lot
and
i
know
it
will
cost
me
my
life
she
acceded
to
the
proposal
and
years
found
them
one
in
happiness
then
a
daughter
was
born
but
the
bearing
and
nursing
were
too
much
for
her
delicate
constitution
and
she
continued
to
sink
until
she
found
rest
in
the
grave
of
all
her
beautiful
and
noble
sayings
none
reflect
more
moral
grandeur
of
spirit
than
the
one
in
which
she
expressed
her
purpose
to
prove
true
to
posterity
the
signs
of
pregnancy
the
symptoms
which
indicate
pregnancy
are
cessation
of
the
menses
enlargement
of
the
mammæ
nausea
especially
in
the
morning
distention
of
the
abdomen
and
movement
of
the
foetus
a
married
woman
has
reason
to
suspect
that
she
may
have
conceived
when
at
the
proper
time
she
fails
to
menstruate
especially
when
she
knows
that
she
is
liable
to
become
pregnant
a
second
menstrual
failure
strengthens
this
suspicion
although
there
are
many
other
causes
which
might
prevent
the
appearance
of
the
menses
such
as
disease
of
the
uterus
general
debility
or
taking
cold
and
all
of
these
should
be
taken
into
account
in
the
absence
of
all
apparent
influences
calculated
to
obstruct
the
menses
the
presumption
ordinarily
is
that
pregnancy
is
the
cause
of
their
the
evidence
is
still
more
conclusive
when
the
mammæ
and
abdomen
enlarge
after
experiencing
morning
sickness
notwithstanding
all
these
symptoms
the
audible
sound
of
the
heart
or
the
movements
of
the
foetus
are
the
only
signs
of
a
pregnant
condition
the
duration
of
pregnancy
the
ordinary
duration
of
pregnancy
is
about
forty
weeks
or
days
it
is
difficult
to
foretell
exactly
when
a
pregnancy
will
be
completed
for
it
can
not
be
known
precisely
when
it
began
some
gestations
are
more
protracted
than
others
but
the
average
duration
is
the
time
we
have
given
a
very
reasonable
way
to
compute
the
term
is
to
reckon
three
months
back
from
the
day
when
the
menses
ceased
and
then
add
five
days
to
that
time
which
will
be
the
date
of
the
expected
time
of
confinement
it
is
customary
also
for
women
to
count
from
the
middle
of
the
month
after
the
last
appearance
of
the
menses
and
then
allow
ten
months
for
the
term
this
computation
generally
proves
correct
except
in
those
instances
in
which
conception
takes
place
immediately
before
the
fast
appearance
of
the
catamenia
a
few
women
can
forecast
the
time
of
labor
from
the
occurrence
of
quickening
by
allowing
eighteen
weeks
for
the
time
which
has
elapsed
since
conception
and
more
for
the
time
yet
to
elapse
before
the
confinement
with
those
in
whom
quickening
occurs
regularly
in
a
certain
week
of
pregnancy
this
calculation
may
prove
nearly
correct
the
english
law
fixes
no
precise
limit
for
the
legitimacy
of
the
child
in
france
a
child
is
regarded
as
lawfully
begotten
if
born
within
three
hundred
days
after
the
death
or
departure
of
the
husband
there
are
a
sufficient
number
of
cases
on
record
to
show
that
gestation
may
be
prolonged
two
and
even
three
weeks
beyond
the
ordinary
or
average
term
the
variation
of
time
may
be
thus
accounted
for
after
insemination
a
considerable
interval
elapses
before
fecundation
takes
place
and
the
passage
of
the
fertilized
germ
from
the
ovary
to
the
uterus
is
also
liable
to
be
retarded
there
are
many
circumstances
and
conditions
which
might
serve
to
diminish
its
ordinary
rate
of
progress
and
postpone
the
date
of
conception
this
would
materially
lengthen
the
time
of
gestation
it
is
likewise
difficult
to
determine
the
shortest
period
at
which
gestation
may
terminate
and
the
child
be
able
to
survive
a
child
may
be
born
and
continue
to
live
for
some
months
after
or
weeks
of
gestation
it
was
so
decided
at

in
an
ecclesiastical
trial
we
have
not
the
space
to
describe
minutely

at

of

and

hygiene
pure
air
the
object
of
hygiene
is
the
of
hitherto
we
have
considered
at
some
length
the
science
of
functions
or
and
now
under
the
head
of
we
will
give
an
outline
of
the
means
of
maintaining
the
functional
integrity
of
the
system
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
including
under
this
head
preventive
medicine
the
special
province
of
which
is
to
abate
remove
or
destroy
the
many
causes
of
disease
the
greeks
bestowed
divine
honors
upon
aesculapius
because
he
remedied
the
evils
of
mankind
and
healed
the
sick
the
word
hygiene
is
derived
from
hygeia
the
name
of
the
greek
goddess
of
health
as
male
and
female
are
made
one
in
wedlock
so
medicine
and
hygiene
restoration
and
preservation
are
inseparably
united

medicine
remedial

qualities
hygiene

sustains
medical
practice
corrects
and

the
one
is
preservative
and
conservative
the
other
curative
and
restorative
these
discriminations
are
as
radical
as
health
and
sickness
as
distinct
as
physiology
and
pathology
and
to
confound
them
is
as
unnatural
as
to
look
for
the
beauties
of
health
in
the
chamber
of
sickness
the
true
physician
brings
to
his
aid
physiology
hygiene
and
medicine
and
combines
the
science
of
the
former
with
the
art
of
the
latter
that
restoration
may
be
made
permanent
and
the
health
preserved
by
the
aid
of
hygiene
but
when
any
one
makes
hygiene
exclusively
the
physician
or
deals
wholly
in
hygienic
regulations
with
little
respect
for
physiology
or
lavishly
advertises
with
hygienic
prefixes
we
may
at
once
consider
it
a
display
not
of
genuine
scientific
knowledge
but
only
of
the
ignorance
of
a
quack
some
of
the
modern
twaddle
about
health
is
a
conglomeration
of
the
poorest
kind
of
trash
expressing
and
inculcating
more
errors
and
whims
than
it
does
common
sense
many
persons
dilate
upon
these
subjects
with
amazing
flippancy
their
mission
seeming
to
be
to
traduce
the
profession
rather
than
to
act
as
and
assistants
we
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
real
argument
going
on
between
the
educated
members
of
the
medical
profession
but
rather
that
the
senseless
clamor
we
occasionally
hear
comes
only
from
the
stampede
of
some
routed
demoralized
company
of
quacks
in
the
following
pages
we
shall
introduce
to
the
reader
attention
several
important
hygienic
subjects
although
there
are
many
more
that
ought
to
receive
special
notice
such
as
we
do
mention
demand
universal
attention
because
a
disregard
of
the
conditions
which
we
shall
enumerate
is
fraught
with
great
danger
our
lives
are
lengthened
or
shortened
by
the
observance
or
neglect
of
the
rules
of
common
sense
and
these
do
not
require
any
great
personal
sacrifice
or
the
practice
of
absurd
precautions
pure

for
respiration
ordinary
atmospheric
air
contains
nearly
parts
of
oxygen
and
of
nitrogen
and
about
three
parts
of
carbonic
acid
in
parts
expired
air
contains
about
parts
of
carbonic
acid
and
only
between
and
parts
of
oxygen
while
the
quantity
of
nitrogen
undergoes
little
or
no
alteration
thus
air
which
has
been
breathed
has
lost
about
five
per
cent
of
oxygen
and
has
gained
nearly
five
per
cent
of
carbonic
acid
in
addition
the
expired
air
contains
a
greater
or
less
quantity
of
highly
decomposable
animal
matter
and
however
dry
the
atmospheric
air
may
be
the
expired
air
is
always
saturated
with
watery
vapor
and
no
matter
what
the
temperature
of
the
external
air
may
be
that
of
the
exhaled
air
is
always
nearly
as
warm
as
the
blood
an
adult
man
on
a
average
breathes
about
sixteen
times
in
a
minute
and
at
every
inspiration
takes
in
about
thirty
cubic
inches
of
air
and
at
every
expiration
exhales
about
the
same
amount
hence
it
follows
that
about
cubic
feet
of
air
are
passed
through
the
lungs
of
an
adult
man
every
hour
and
deprived
of
oxygen
and
charged
with
carbonic
acid
to
the
amount
of
nearly
five
per
cent
the
more
nearly
the
composition
of
the
external
air
approaches
that
of
the
expired
air
the
slower
will
be
the
diffusion
of
carbonic
acid
outwards
and
of
oxygen
inwards
and
the
more
charged
with
carbonic
acid
and
deficient
in
oxygen
will
the
blood
in
the
lungs
become
asphyxia
takes
place
whenever
the
proportion
of
carbonic
acid
in
the
external
air
reaches
ten
per
providing
the
oxygen
is
diminished
in
like
proportion
and
it
does
not
matter
whether
this
condition
of
the
external
air
is
produced
by
shutting
out
fresh
air
from
a
room
or
by
increasing
the
number
of
persons
who
are
consuming
the
same
air
or
by
permitting
the
air
to
be
deprived
of
oxygen
by
combustion
by
a
fire
a
deficiency
of
oxygen
and
an
accumulation
of
carbonic
acid
in
the
atmosphere
produce
injurious
effects
however
long
before
the
asphyxiating
point
is
attained
headache
drowsiness
and
uneasiness
occur
when
less
than
one
per
cent
of
the
oxygen
of
the
atmosphere
is
replaced
by
other
matters
and
the
constant
breathing
of
such
an
atmosphere
lowers
vitality
and
predisposes
to
disease
therefore
every
human
being
should
be
supplied
by
proper
ventilation
with
a
sufficient
supply
of
fresh
air
every
adult
individual
ought
to
have
at
least
cubic
feet
of
to
himself
and
this
space
ought
to
communicate
freely
with
the
external
atmosphere
by
means
of
direct
or
indirect
channels
hence
a
for
one
adult
person
should
not
be
less
than
nine
by
ten
feet
in
breadth
and
length
and
nine
feet
in
height
what
occurred
in
the
black
hole
at
calcutta
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
effect
of
vitiated
air
one
hundred
and
englishmen
were
confined
in
a
room
eighteen
feet
square
with
two
small
windows
on
one
side
to
admit
air
ten
hours
after
their
imprisonment
only
were
alive
ventilation
of
school
rooms
the
depression
and
faintness
from
which
many
students
suffer
after
being
confined
in
a
poorly
ventilated
school
room
is
clearly
traceable
to
vitiated
air
while
the
evil
is
often
ascribed
to
excessive
mental
exertion
the
effect
of
ventilation
upon
the
health
of
students
is
a
subject
of
universal
interest
to
parents
and
educators
and
at
present
is
receiving
the
marked
attention
of
school
authorities
windsor
of
winchester
made
a
few
pertinent
remarks
upon
this
subject
in
the
annual
report
of
the
state
board
of
health
of
massachusetts
one
of
the
institutions
which
was
spoken
of
in
the
report
of
as
a
in
the
warming
and
ventilation
of
which
much
care
had
been
bestowed
was
visited
in
december
he
reports
as
follows
i
visited
several
of
the
rooms
and
found
the
air
in
all
offensive
to
the
smell
the
odor
being
such
as
one
would
imagine
old
boots
dirty
clothes
and
perspiration
would
make
if
boiled
down
together
again
in
the
new
the
hot
air
enters
at
two
registers
in
the
floor
on
one
side
and
makes
or
is
supposed
to
make
its
exit
by
a
ventilator
at
the
floor
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
the
master
said
air
was
supposed
to
have
some
degree
of
intelligence
and
to
know
that
the
ventilator
was
its
proper
thorough
ventilation
has
been
neglected
by
many
school
officials
on
account
of
the
increased
expense
it
causes
in
our
climate
during
seven
months
at
least
pure
atmospheric
air
must
be
paid
for
the
construction
of
vertical
ducts
the
extra
amount
of
fuel
and
the
attendant
expenditures
are
the
objections
which
in
the
opinion
of
many
persons
outweigh
the
health
and
happiness
of
the
future
generation
it
is
necessary
for
the
proper
ventilation
of
our
school
rooms
that
an
adequate
supply
of
fresh
air
should
be
admitted
which
should
be
warmed
before
being
admitted
to
the
room
and
which
should
be
discharged
as
contaminated
after
its
expiration
the
proper
ventilation
of
the
school
room
consists
in
the
warming
and
introduction
of
fresh
air
from
without
and
the
discharge
of
the
expired
and
unwholesome
air
from
within
this
may
be
accomplished
by
means
of
doors
windows
chimneys
and
finally
by
ventilators
placed
one
near
the
level
of
the
floor
and
the
other
near
the
ceiling
of
the
room
the
ventilators
ought
to
be
arranged
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
room
in
order
to
insure
a
current
and
an
abundant
supply
of
air
when
trustees
and
patrons
realize
that
pure
air
is
absolutely
essential
to
health
and
that
their
children
are
being
slowly
poisoned
by
the
foul
air
of
school
rooms
then
they
will
construct
our
halls
of
learning
with
a
due
regard
for
the
laws
of
hygiene
and
students
will
not
droop
under
their
tasks
on
account
of
the
absence
of

bountiful

ventilation
of
factories
and
workshops
this
is
a
subject
which
demands
the
immediate
attention
of
manufacturers
and
employers
the
odors
of
oil
coal
gas
and
animal
products
render
the
air
foul
and
stagnant
and
often
give
rise
to
violent
diseases
among
the
operatives
from
two
to
four
hundred
persons
are
often
confined
in
workshops
six
hundred
feet
long
with
no
means
of
ventilation
except
windows
one
side
the
air
is
breathed
and
until
the
operatives
complain
of
languor
and
headache
which
they
attribute
to
overwork
the
cause
of
the
headache
is
the
inhalation
of
foul
air
at
every
expansion
of
the
lungs
if
the
proprietors
would
provide
efficient
means
for
ventilating
their
workshops
the
cost
of
construction
would
be
repaid
with
compound
interest
in
the
better
health
of
their
operatives
and
the
consequent
increase
of
labor
our
manufacturers
must
learn
and
practice
the
great
principle
of
political
economy
namely
that
the
interests
of
the
laborer
and
employer
are
mutual
ventilation
of
our

not
less
important

the
ventilation
of

the

of
the
noxious

constantly
accumulating

of

tenements
occupied
by
the
poor
of
our
cities
are
literally

what
wonder
that
our
streets
are
filled
with
squalid
children
charity
indeed
visits
these
miserable
homes
bringing
garments
and
food
to
their
inmates
but
she
has
been
slow
to
learn
that
fresh
air
is
just
as
essential
to
life
as
food
or
clothing
care
should
be
taken
by
the
public
authorities
of
every
city
that
its
tenement
houses
do
not
degenerate
into
foul
hovels
like
those
of
the
poor
english
laborer
so
graphically
portrayed
by
dickens
but
rooms
are
not
found
exclusively
in
the
abodes
of
the
poor
true

the
homes
of

the
effect
of

is
modified
by

men
of
wealth
give
far
more
attention
to
the
architecture
and
adornment
of
their
houses
to
costly
decorations
and
expensive
furniture
than
to
proper
ventilation
farmers
too
are
careless
in
the
construction
of
their
cottages
their
dwellings
are
often
built
for
convenience
in
too
close
proximity
to
the
barn
because
they
do
not
construct
a
suitable
sewer
or
drain

thrown
out
of
the
back

where
it
accumulates

penetrates
the
interior
of
the
house
and
there
being
no
means
of
ventilation
it
remains
to
be
breathed
by
the
occupants
the
result
is
that
for
the
sake
of
saving
a
few
dollars
which
ought
to
be
expended
in
the
construction

all
these

those
which

need
for

only
a

ability

a
closer
study
of
causes
many
of
which
are
known

hidden
under

cellars
of

and
which
at
last
are
only
preventable
by
public

imprisoned
dampness
which
saturates

tyndall
says

in
passing
through

room
reveals
its
track
by
illuminating

they
be
invisible
by

makes
them
dance
naked
in
his
beams
after
giving
the
details
and
results
of
a
series
of
experiments
in
which
he
attempted
to
extract
the
dust
from
the
air
of
the
royal
institute
by
passing
it
through
a
tube
containing
fragments
of
glass
wetted
with
concentrated
sulphuric
acid
and
thence
through
a
second
tube
containing
fragments
of
marble
wetted
with
a
strong
solution
of
caustic
potash
which
experiments
were
attended
with
perfect
failure
the
professor
continues
i
tried
to
intercept
this
floating
matter
in
various
ways
and
on
the
day
just
mentioned
prior
to
sending
the
air
through
the
drying
apparatus
i
carefully
permitted
it
to
pass
over
the
tip
of
a
flame
the
floating
matter
no
longer
appeared
having
been
burnt
up
by
the
flame
it
was
therefore
of
i
was
by
no
means
prepared
for
this
result
for
i
had
thought
that
the
dust
of
our
air
was
in
great
part
inorganic
and
in
a
foot
note
he
says
according
to
an
analysis
kindly
furnished
me
by
percy
the
dust
collected
the
of
the
british
museum
contains
fully
fifty
per
cent
of
inorganic
matter
i
have
every
confidence
in
the
results
of
this
distinguished
chemist
they
show
that
the
dust
of
our
rooms
is
as
it
were
winnowed
from
the
heavier
matter
again
he
says
the
air
of
our
london
rooms
is
loaded
with
this
organic
dust
nor
is
the
country
air
free
from
its
presence
however
ordinary
daylight
may
permit
it
to
disguise
itself
a
sufficiently
powerful
beam
causes
dust
suspended
in
air
to
appear
almost
as
a
nobody
could
in
the
first
instance
without
repugnance
place
the
mouth
at
the
illuminated
focus
of
the
electric
beam
and
inhale
the
dust
revealed
there
nor
is
the
repugnance
abolished
by
the
reflection
that
although
we
do
not
see
the
floating
particles
we
are
taking
them
into
our
lungs
every
hour
and
minute
of
our
lives
the
notion
was
expressed
by
kircher
and
favored
by
linnaeus
that
epidemic
diseases
are
due
to
germs
which
float
in
the
atmosphere
enter
the
body
and
produce
disturbance
by
the
development
within
the
body
of
parasitic
life
while
it
was
struggling
against
great
odds
this
theory
found
an
expounder
and
a
defender
in
the
president
of
this
institution
at
a
time
when
most
of
his
medical
brethren
considered
it
a
wild
dream
sir
henry
holland
contended
that
some
form
of
the
was
probably
true
professor
tyndall
proposes
means
by
the
application
of
which
air
loaded
with
noxious
particles
may
be
freed
from
them
before
entering
the
air
passages
the
following
embodies
his
suggestions
on
this
point
respirator
i
now
empty
my
lungs
as
perfectly
as
possible
and
placing
a
handful
of
against
my
mouth
and
nostrils
inhale
through
it
there
is
no
difficulty
in
thus
filling
the
lungs
with
air
on
expiring
this
air
through
a
glass

the

permitting

the
human
body
is
continually
undergoing
changes
which
commence
with
the
earliest
dawn
of
existence
and
end
only
with
death
the
old
and
materials
are
constantly
being
removed
to
make
room
for
the
new
growth
and
development
as
well
as
the
elimination
of
and
useless
matter
continually
require
new
supplies
which
are
to
be
derived
from
our
food
to
fulfill
these
demands
it
is
necessary
that
the
nutriment
should
be
of
the
proper
quality
and
of
sufficient
variety
to
furnish
all
the
constituents
of
the
healthy
body
in
order
that
food
may
be
of
utility
like
other
building
materials
it
must
undergo
preparation
the
crude
substance
must
be
worked
up
into
proper
condition
and
shape
for
use
in
other
words
it
must
be
but
this
does
not
end
the
process
of
supply
each
different
substance
must
be
taken
by
the
different
bands
of
workmen
after
due
preparation
in
the
workshop
to
its
appropriate
locality
in
the
structure
and
there
fitted
into
its
proper
place
this
is
in
reality
it
becomes
a
portion
of
the
body
and
is
advantageous
in
maintaining
the
symmetry
and
usefulness
of
the
part
to
which
it
is
assigned
this
constitutes
the
ultimate
object
of
food
eating
is
the
process
of
receiving
the
food
into
the
mouth
prehension
mastication
and
minutely
dividing
and
mixing
it
with
the
saliva
conveying
it
to
the
stomach
plenty
of
time
should
be
taken
at
meals
to
thoroughly
masticate
the
food
and
mix
it
with
the
saliva
which
being
one
of
the
natural
solvents
favors
its
farther
solution
by
the
juices
of
the
stomach
the
healthy
action
of
the
digestive
powers
is
favored
by
tranquility
of
mind
agreeable
associations
and
pleasant
conversation
while
eating
it
is
proverbial
of
the
american
people
that
they
bolt
their
food
whole
washing
it
down
with
various
fluids
thus
forcing
the
stomach
to
perform
not
only
its
own
duties
but
also
those
of
the
teeth
and
salivary
glands
this
manner
of
dispatching
food
which
should
go
through
the
natural
process
above
described
is
not
without
its
baleful
consequences
for
the
americans
are
called
a
nation
of
eating
slowly
masticating
the
food
thoroughly
and
drinking
but
moderately
during
meals
will
allow
the
juices
of
the
stomach
to
fulfill
their
proper
function
and
healthy
digestion
and
nutrition
will
result
if
the
food
is
swallowed
nearly
whole
not
only
will
a
longer
time
be
required
for
its
solution
but
frequently
it
will
ferment
and
begin
to
decay
before
nutritive
transformation
can
be
effected
even
when
the
gastric
juice
is
undiluted
with
the
fluids
which
the
hurried
eater
imbibes
during
his
meal
regularity
of
meals
can
not
be
too
strongly
insisted
upon
the
stomach
as
well
as
other
parts
of
the
body
must
have
intervals
of
rest
or
its
energies
are
soon
exhausted
its
functions
impaired
and
is
the
result
nothing
of
the
character
of
food
should
ever
be
taken
except
at
regular
meal
times
some
persons
are
munching
cakes
apples
nuts
candies
at
all
hours
and
then
wonder
why
they
have
weak
stomachs
they
take
their
meals
regularly
and
neither
eat
rapidly
nor
too
much
and
yet
they
are
troubled
with
indigestion
the
truth
is
they
keep
their
stomachs
almost
constantly
at
work
and
hence
tired
out
which
is
the
occasion
of
the
annoyance
and
distress
they
experience
eating
too
much
it
should
always
be
remembered
that
the
nutrition
of
our
bodies
does
not
depend
upon
the
amount
eaten
but
upon
the
amount
that
is
digested
eating
too
much
is
nearly
as
bad
as
swallowing
the
food
whole
the
stomach
is
unable
to
digest
all
of
it
and
it
ferments
and
gives
rise
to
unpleasant
results
the
unnatural
distention
of
the
stomach
with
food
causes
it
to
press
upon
the
neighboring
organs
interfering
with
the
proper
performance
of
their
functions
and
if
frequently
repeated
gives
rise
to
serious
disease
people
more
frequently
eat
too
much
than
too
little
and
to
omit
a
meal
when
the
stomach
is
slightly
deranged
is
frequently
the
best
medicine
it
is
an
excellent
plan
to
rise
from
the
table
before
the
desire
for
food
is
quite
satisfied
late
suppers
it
is
generally
conceded
that
late
suppers
are
injurious
and
should
never
be
indulged
in
persons
who
dine
late
have
little
need
of
food
after
their
dinner
unless
they
are
kept
up
until
a
late
hour
in
such
cases
a
moderate
meal
may
be
allowed
but
it
should
be
eaten
two
or
three
hours
before
retiring
those
who
dine
in
the
middle
of
the
day
should
have
supper
but
sufficiently
early
so
that
a
proper
length
of
time
may
elapse
before
going
to
bed
in
order
that
active
digestion
may
not
be
required
during
sleep
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
advisable
to
go
wholly
without
this
meal
but
the
food
eaten
should
be
light
easily
digestible
and
moderate
in
quantity
persons
who
indulge
in
hearty
suppers
at
late
hours
usually
experience
a
poor

so
that
when
the
teeth

has
become
accustomed
to
various
kinds
of
nourishment

continually
dosing
the

the
most
fruitful
sources
of
infant
mortality
and
should
receive
the
condemnation
of
every

preparation
of
food
the
production
of
pure
blood
requires
that
all
the
food
selected
should
be
rich
in

elements
and
well
cooked
to
announce
a
standard
by
which
all
persons
shall
be
guided
in
the
selection
and
preparation
of
their
food
is
impossible
especially
is
this
the
case
in
a
country
the
inhabitants
of
which
represent
almost
every
nation
on
the
face
of
the
globe
travelers
are
aware
that
there
is
as
much
diversity
in
the
articles
of
food
and
methods
of
cookery
among
the
various
nationalities
as
in
the
erection
of
their
dwellings
and
in
their
mental
characteristics
in
america
we
have
a
conglomeration
of
all
these
peoples
and
for
a
native
american
to
lay
down
rules
of

for
his
german
french
english
welsh
and
irish
neighbors
or
is
useless
for
they
will
seldom
read
them
and
therefore
can
not
profit
by
them
there
are
however
certain
conditions
recognized
by
the
hygienic
writers
of
every
nation
the
adequate
nutrition
of
the
organic
tissues
demands
a
plentiful
supply
of
pure
blood
or
the
digestive
apparatus
will
become
impaired
the
mental
processes
deranged
and
the
entire
bony
and
muscular
systems
will
lose
their
strength
and
elasticity
and
be
incapacitated
for
labor
different
kinds
of
food
required
the
different
periods
and
circumstances
of
life
require
their
appropriate
food
and
the
welfare
of
mankind
demands
that
it
should
supply
both
the
inorganic
and
organic
substances
employed
in
the
development
of
every
tissue
the
inorganic
elements
employed
in
our
construction
of
which
sulphur
soda
iron
lime
and
are
the
most
important
are
not
considered
as
aliments
but
are
found
in
the
organic
kingdom
variously
arranged
and
combined
with
organic
materials
in
sufficient
quantities
for
ordinary
purposes
when
however
from
any
cause
a
lack
of
any
of
these
occurs
so
that
their
relative
normal
proportions
are
deranged
the
system
suffers
and
restoration
to
a
healthy
condition
can
only
be
accomplished
by
supplying
the
deficiency
this
may
be
done
by
selecting
the
article
of
food
richest
in
the
element
which
is
wanting
or
by
introducing
it
as
a
medicine
it
must
be
remembered
that
those
substances
which
enter
into
the
construction
of
the
human
fabric
are
not
promiscuously
employed
by
nature
but
that
each
and
every
one
is
destined
to
fulfill
a
definite
indication
enters
largely
into
the
formation
of
bone
either
as
a
or
a
and
is
required
in
much
greater
quantities
in
early
life
while
the
bone
is
undergoing
development
than
afterwards
in
childhood
the
bones
are
composed
largely
of
animal
matter
being
pliable
and
easily
moulded
for
this
reason
the
limbs
of
young
children
bend
under
the
weight
of
their
bodies
and
unless
care
is
taken
they
become
and
distorted
whenever
there
is
a
continued
deficiency
of
the
earthy
constituents
disease
of
the
bones
ensues
therefore
during
childhood
and
particularly
during
the
period
of
dentition
or
teething
the
food
should
be
nutritious
and
at
the
same
time
contain
a
due
proportion
of
lime
which
is
preferable
in
the
form
of
a
phosphate
when
it
can
not
be
furnished
by
the
food
it
should
be
supplied
artificially
delayed
prolonged
and
tedious
dentition
generally
arises
from
a
deficiency
of
lime
with
the
advance
of
age
it
accumulates
and
the
bone
becomes
hard
inelastic
and
capable
of
supporting
heavy
weights
farther
on
as
in
old
age
the
animal
matter
of
bone
becomes
diminished
and
lime
takes
its
place
so
that
the
bones
become
brittle
and
are
easily
broken
lime
exists
largely
in
hard
water

to
a
greater
or
less
extent
in

in
nearly
all
foods

those
of
an

in
various
combinations
in
different
parts
of
the
body
particularly
in
the
brain
and
nervous
system
persons
who
perform
a
large
amount
of
mental
labor
require
more
phosphorus
than
those
engaged
in
other
pursuits
it
exists
largely
in
the
hulls
of
wheat
in
fish
and
in
eggs
it
should
enter
to
a
considerable
extent
into
the
diet
of
brain
workers
and
the
bread
consumed
by
them
should
be
made
of
unbolted
flour
iron
and
are
all
necessary
in

various

of

of

of

no

every

which
is
to

food
must
contain
a
sufficient
quantity
of
this
most
important
and
complex
constituent
of
the
body
in
addition
it
must
also
contain
a
sufficient
quantity
of
the
mineral
ingredients
which
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
body
its
power
of
supporting
life
and
maintaining
the
weight
and
composition
of
the
body
remains
unaltered
whether
it
contains
fats
or
amyloids
or
not
the
secretion
of
urea
and
consequently
the
loss
of
nitrogen
goes
on
continually
and
the
body
therefore
must
necessarily
waste
unless
the
supply
of
proteid
matter
is
constantly
renewed
since
this
is
the
only
class
of
foods
that
contains
nitrogen
in
any
considerable
quantity
there
can
be
no
absolute
necessity
for
any
other
but
those
containing
the
proteid
and
mineral
elements
of
the
body
from
what
has
been
said
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
whether
an
animal
be
carnivorous
or
herbivorous
it
begins
to
starve
as
soon
as
its
vital
consist
only
of
amyloids
or
fats
or
both
it
suffers
from
what
has
been
termed
starvation
and
if
proteid
matters
are
withheld
entirely
it
soon
dies
in
such
a
case
and
still
more
in
the
case
of
an
animal
which
is
entirely
deprived
of
vital
food
the
organism
as
long
as
it
continues
to
live
feeds
upon
itself
the
waste
products
necessarily
being
formed
at
the
expense
of
its
own
body
although
proteid
matter
is
the
essential
element
of
food
and
under
certain
circumstances
may
be
sufficient
of
itself
to
support
the
body
it
is
a
very
uneconomical
food
the
white
of
an
egg
which
may
be
taken
as
a
type
of
the
proteids
contains
about
fifteen
per
cent
of
nitrogen
and
per
cent
of
carbon
therefore
a
man
feeding
upon
this
would
take
in
about
three
and
a
half
times
as
much
carbon
as
nitrogen
it
has
been
proved
that
a
healthy
adult
man
taking
a
fair
amount
of
exercise
and
maintaining
his
weight
and
body
temperature
eliminates
about
thirteen
times
as
much
carbon
as
nitrogen
however
if
he
is
to
get
his
necessary
quantity
about
grains
of
carbon
out
of
albumen
he
must
eat
grains
of
that
substance
but
this
quantity
of
albumen
contains
nearly
four
times
as
much
nitrogen
as
he
requires
in
other
words
it
takes
about
four
pounds
of
lean
meat
free
from
fat
to
furnish
grains
of
carbon
the
quantity
required
whereas
one
pound
yields
the
requisite
quantity
of
nitrogen
thus
a
man
restricted
exclusively
to
a
proteid
diet
must
take
an
enormous
quantity
of
it
this
would
involve
a
large
amount
of
unnecessary
physiological
labor
to
comminute
dissolve
and
absorb
the
food
and
to
excrete
the
superfluous
nitrogenous
matter
unproductive
labor
should
be
avoided
as
much
in
physiological
as
in
political
economy
the
universal
practice
of
subsisting
on
a
mixed
diet
in
which
proteids
are
mixed
with
fats
or
amyloids
is
therefore
justifiable
fats
contain
about
per
cent
of
carbon
and
amyloids
about
per
cent
we
have
seen
that
there
is
sufficient
nitrogen
in
a
pound
of
meat
free
from
fat
to
supply
a
healthy
adult
man
for
hours
but
that
it
contains
only
of
the
quantity
of
carbon
required
about
half
a
pound
of
fat
or
one
pound
of
sugar
will
supply
the
quantity
of
carbon
necessary
the
fat
if
properly
subdivided
and
the
sugar
by
reason
of
its
solubility
pass
with
great
ease
into
the
circulation
the
physiological
labor
consequently
being
reduced
to
a
minimum
several
common
articles
of
diet
contain
in
themselves
all
the
necessary
elements
thus
butchers
meat
ordinarily
contains
from
to
per
cent
of
fat
and
bread
contains
the
proteid
gluten
and
the
amyloids
starch
and
sugar
together
with
minute
quantities
of
fat
however
on
account
of
the
proportion
in
which
these
proteid
and
other
components
of
the
body
exist
in
these
substances
neither
of
them
by
itself
is
such
a
physiologically
economical
food
as
it
is
when
combined
with
the
other
in
the
proportion
of
three
to
eight
or
three
quarters
of
a
pound
of
meat
to
two
pounds
of
bread
a
day
it
is
evident
that
a
variety
of
food
is
necessary
for
health
animals
fed
exclusively
upon
one
class
or
upon
a
single
article
of
diet
droop
and
die
and
in
the
human
family
we
know
that
the
constant
use
of
one
kind
of
diet
causes
disgust
even
when
not
very
long
continued
consequently
we
infer
that
the
welfare
of
man
demands
that
his
food
be
of
sufficient
variety
to
supply
his
body
with
all
of
its
component
parts
if
this
is
not
done
the
appetite
is
deranged
and
often
craves
the
very
article
which
is
necessary
to
supply
the
deficiency
after
the
component
parts
of
the
organism
have
assimilated
the
nutritious
elements
of
particular
kinds
of
food
for
a
certain
length
of
time
they
lose
the
power
of
effecting
the
necessary
changes
for
proper
nutrition
and
a
supply
of
other
material
is
imperatively
demanded
when
the
diet
has
been
long
restricted
to
proteids
consisting
largely
of
salt
meats
fresh
vegetables
and
fruits
containing
the
organic
acids
become
indispensable
otherwise
the
scorbutic
condition
or
scurvy
is
almost
sure
to
be
developed
fresh
vegetables
and
fruits
should
be
eaten
in
considerable
quantities
at
the
proper
seasons
value
of
animal
food
the
principal
animal
food
used
in
this
country
consists
of
mutton
and
beef
and
mutton
are
rich
in
material
although
pork
is
extensively
produced
in
some
portions
of
this
country
and
enters
largely
into
the
diet
of
some
classes
yet
its
use
except
in
winter
is
not
to
be
encouraged
the
same
amount
of
beef
would
give
far
greater
returns
in

all
of

oatmeal

the

the
relative

may
be
ascertained
very
correctly
by
weighing

for
the

though
they
are
very
palatable
the
solid

however
are
rich
in
albumen
it
is
evident
that
the
quantity
necessary
to
maintain
the

must
be
greatly
modified
by
the
habits
of

the

and
the

the
daily
loss
of

which
must
be
replaced
by
material
from

as
we
have
seen
is
very
great
in
addition
to
the
loss
of
carbon
and
nitrogen
about
four
and
a
half
pounds
of
water
are
removed
from
the

in

and
it
is
necessary
that
about
this
quantity
should
be
introduced
into
the

in
some
form
or
other
however
much
it
may
be
adulterated
professor

from
experiments
performed
while
living
on
an
exclusive
diet
of
bread
fresh
meat
and
butter
with
coffee
and
water
for

we
have
found
that
the
entire

required
during

by
a
man
in
full
health
and
taking
free
exercise
in

is
as

that
is
to
say
rather
less

on
this
account
fat

is
taken
in
large
quantities
and
with

relish
the
quantity
of

consumed
by
the
natives
of
the
arctic

is
almost
incredible
the
russian
admiral
saritcheff
relates
that
one
of
the
esquimaux
in
his
presence
devoured
a
mass
of
boiled
rice
and
butter
which
weighed
pounds
at
a
single

and
hayes
states
that
usually
the
daily
ration
of
an
esquimau
is
from
twelve
to
fifteen
pounds
of
meat
of
which
is
fat
and
on
one
occasion
he
saw
a
man
eat
ten

in
order
that

it
is
important
that
the
meat
be
put
into
water
or
that
which
is
not
so
hot
as
to
coagulate
the
albumen
which
would
prevent
it
from
being
extracted

then
by

the
health
and
happiness
of
a
family
depend
to
a
certain
extent
on
good
bread
at
all
events
our
enjoyment
would
be
greater
if
it
were
only
better
prepared
we
make
the
following
extract
from
an
article
printed
by
the
state
board
of
health
concerning
the
food
of
the
people
of
massachusetts
as
an
example
of
good
bread
we
would
mention
that
which
is
always
to
be
had
at
the
restaurant
of
parker
hotel
in
boston
it
is
not
better
than
is
found
on
the
continent
of
europe
on
all
the
great
lines
of
travel
and
in
common
use
by
millions
of
people
in
germany
and
france
but
with
us
it
is
a
rare
example
of
what
bread
may
be
it
is
made
from
a
mixture
of
flour
such
as
is
generally
sold
in
our
markets
water
salt
and
yeast
nothing
else
the
yeast
is
made
from
malt
potatoes
and
hops
dough
is
kneaded
from
one
and
a
half
to
two
hours
and
is
then
thoroughly
baked
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
the
kneading
which
in
this
country
takes
the
housewife
time
and
muscle
in
europe
is
done
by
the
help
of
machinery
so
here
in
large
villages
and
cities
people
might
furnish
themselves
with
good
bread
by
means
of
associations
even
at
a
less
cost
than
at
present
beverages
water
the
importance
of
water
in
the
economy
of
nature
is
obvious
to
all
it
is
the
most
abundant
substance
of
which
we
have
knowledge
it
composes
of
the
weight
of
vegetables
and
of
that
of
animals
it
is
essential
to
the
continuance
of
organic
life
water
is
universally
present
in
all
of
the
tissues
and
fluids
of
the
body
it
is
not
only
abundant
in
the
blood
and
secretions
but
it
is
also
an
ingredient
of
the
solids
of
the
body
according
to
the
most
accurate
computations
water
is
found
to
constitute
from

of
the
entire
weight
of
the
human
body
the

no

it

it
is
estimated
that
about

is
discharged
in
the
liquid
and
per
cent
in
the
vaporous
form
but
the
absolute
as
well
as
the
relative
amount
discharged
depends
upon
a
variety
of
circumstances
water
is
never
found
perfectly
pure
since
it
holds
in
solution
more
or
less
of
almost
every
substance
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
rain
falling
in
the
country
remote
from
habitations
is
the
purest
water
that
nature
furnishes
for
it
is
then
only
charged
with
the
natural
gases
of
the
atmosphere
in
cities
it
absorbs
organic
and
gaseous
impurities
as
it
falls
through
the
air
and
flowing
over
roofs
of
houses
carries
with
it
soot
and
dust
water
from
melted
snow
is
purer
than
since
it
descends
in
a
solid
form
and
is
therefore
incapable
of
absorbing
gases
is
not
adapted
to
drinking
purposes
unless
well
filtered
all
water
except
that
which
has
been
distilled
contains
air
and
it
is
due
to
this
fact
that
aquatic
animals
can
live
in
it
for
example
put
a
fish
in
distilled
water
and
it
will
soon
die
mineral
impurities
which

filtered
through
the
soil
and
strata
of
the

while
in
some
parts
of
the
dead
sea
there
are
grams
to
the

the
principal
mineral
impurities
of
well
and
spring
water
are
lime
magnesia
soda
and
oxide
of
iron
combined
with
carbonic
and
sulphuric
acids
forming
carbonates
sulphates
and
chloride
of
sodium
or
common
salt
the
most
general
however
are
carbonate
and
sulphate
of
lime
mineral
waters
are
usually
obtained
from
springs
which
contain
a
considerable
amount
of
saline
matter
those
waters
which
abound
in
salts
of
iron
are
called
or
those
containing

are
termed
those
in
which

are
termed
water
derives
the
quality
of
hardness
from
the
salts
of
lime
chiefly
the
sulphates
which
it
contains
hard
water
being
an
imperfect
solvent
is
unsuitable
for
washing
purposes
there
are
two
varieties
of
hardness
one
of
which
is
temporary
being
due
to
the
presence
of
carbonic
acid
gas
in
the
water
which
holds
the
salts
in
solution
and
may
be
removed
by
merely
boiling
the
water
and
thus
expelling
the
gas
when
the
salts
are
deposited
while
the
other
is
permanent
and
can
only
be
removed
by
the
distillation
of
the
water
it
has
been
ascertained
that
twelve
pounds
of
the
best
hard
soap
must
be
added
to
gallons
of
water
of
one
degree
of
hardness
before
a
lather
will
remain
and
consequently
lb
to
gallons
of
water
is
a
measure
of
one
degree
of
hardness
since
hard
water
is
not
so
useful
in
cooking
and
other
domestic
purposes
as
soft
water
causing
a
great
waste
of
labor
and
material
it
is
often
highly
desirable
to
soften
it
which
is
effected
by
the
addition
of
lime
in
what
is
known
as
one
ounce
of
quicklime
should
be
added
to
gallons
of
water
for
each
degree
of
hardness
it
should
be
first
slacked
and
stirred
up
in
a
few
gallons
and
then
thoroughly
mixed
with
the
entire
quantity
then
it
should
be
allowed
to
remain
and
will
become
clear
in
about
three
hours
but
should
not
be
drunk
for
twelve
hours
the
purity
of
drinking
water
is
a
matter
of
much
importance
that
which
contains
a
minute
quantity
of
lead
will
give
rise
to
all
the
symptoms
of
lead
poisoning
if
the
use
of
it
be
sufficiently
prolonged
an
account
is
given
of
the
poisoning
of
the
royal
family
of
france
many
of
whom
suffered
from
this
cause
when
in
exile
at
claremont
the
amount
of
lead
was
only
one
grain
in
the
gallon
care
should
therefore
be
taken
to
avoid
drinking
the
water
which
has
been
contained
in
leaden
pipes
it
should
always
be
allowed
to
run
a
few
minutes
before
being
used
an
excess
of
saline
ingredients
which
in
small
quantities
are
harmless
frequently
produces
marked
disorders
of
the
digestive
organs
a
small
amount
of
putrescent
matter
habitually
introduced
into
the
system
as
in
the
use
of
food
is
productive
of
the
most
serious
results
which
can
be
traced
to
the
direct
action
of
the
poison
introduced
a
case
is
recorded
of
a
certain
locality
favorably
situated
with
regard
to
the
access
of
pure
air
where
an
epidemic
of
fever
broke
out
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
inhabitants
upon
observation
it
was
found
that
the
attacks
of
fever
were
limited
to
those
families
who
used
water
from
a
neighboring
well
the
disagreeable
taste
of
the
water
which
had
been
observed
was
subsequently
traced
to
the
bursting
of
a
sewer
which
had
discharged
a
part
of
its
contents
into
the
well
when
the
cause
was
removed
there
was
no
recurrence
of
the
evil
effects
organic
impurities
water
is
liable
to
organic
contamination
from
a
multitude
of
causes
such
as
drainage
from
dwellings
dust
insects
the
decaying
of
vegetable
and
animal
matter
these
impurities
may
be
mechanically
suspended
or
held
in
solution
in
the
water
although
organic
impurities
which
are
mechanically
suspended
in
water
are
poisonous
yet
they
are
generally
associated
with
animalculea
and
these
feed
upon
and
finally
consume
them
good
water
never
contains
animalculæ
they
are
never
found
in
freshly
fallen
remote
from
dwellings
but
abound
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
in
cisterns
marshes
ponds
and
rivers
these
little
workers
serve
a
useful
purpose
since
they
consume
the
dead
organic
matter
from
the
water
and
having
fulfilled
their
mission
sink
to
the
bottom
and
die
water
which
contains
organic
matter
is
exceedingly
dangerous
to
health
and
its
use
should
be
carefully
avoided
in
low
lands
where
the
current
of
streams
is
sluggish
and
shallow
pools
abound
the
water
is
apt
to
be
more
or
less
infected
with
decaying
vegetable
substances
many
people
living
in
such
localities
and
wishing
to
obtain
water
with
as
little
trouble
as
possible
dig
a
hole
in
the
ground
a
few
feet
in
depth
and
allow
the
stagnant
surface
water
to
accumulate
this
water
is
used
for
drinking
and
cooking
the
result
is
that
ague
prevails
in
such
localities
care
should
be
taken
that
wells
from
which
the
water
is
used
for
household
purposes
are
located
at
a
distance
from
privies
sinks
vaults
and
stagnant
pools
purification
of
water
there
are
various
methods
of
purifying
water
it
may
be
accomplished
by
distillation
which
is
the
most
perfect
method
by
filtration
through
sand
crushed
charcoal
and
other
porous
substances
which
deprives
it
of
suspended
impurities
and
living
organisms
by
boiling
which
destroys
the
vitality
of
all
animal
and
vegetable
matters
drives
out
the
gases
and
precipitates
carbonate
of
lime
which
composes
the
crust
frequently
seen
upon
the
inside
of
or
boilers
by
the
use
of
chemical
agents
which
may
be
employed
to
destroy
or
precipitate
the
deleterious
substances
alum
is
often
used
to
cleanse
roily
water
two
or
three
grains
in
solution
being
sufficient
for
a
quart
it
causes
the
impurities
to
settle
to
the
bottom
so
that
the
clear
water
can
be
poured
or
dipped
out
for
use
one
or
two
grains
of
the
permanganate
of
potassium
will
render
wholesome
a
gallon
of
water
containing
animal
impurities
how
to
use
water
very
little
if
any
water
should
be
taken
at
meal
time
since
the
salivary
glands
furnish
an
abundance
of
watery
fluid
to
assist
in
mastication
when
these
glands
are
aided
with
water
to
wash
down
the
food
their
functions
become
feeble
and
impaired
the
gastric
juice
is
diluted
and
digestion
is
weakened
large
draughts
of
cold
water
ought
never
to
be
indulged
in
since
they
cause
derangement
of
the
stomach
when
the
body
is
overheated
the
use
of
much
water
is
injurious
it
should
only
be
taken
in
small
quantities
thirst
may
be
partially
allayed
without
injury
by
holding
cold
water
in
the
mouth
for
a
short
time
and
then
spitting
it
out
taking
care
to
swallow
but
very
little
travelers
frequently
experience
inconvenience
from
change
of
water
if
the
means
are
at
hand
let
them
purify
their
drinking
water
if
not
they
should
drink
as
little
as
possible
persons
who
visit
the
banks
of
the
ohio
missouri
or
mississippi
rivers
and
similar
localities
almost
invariably
suffer
from
some
form
of
gastric
or
intestinal
disease
water
standing
in
close
rooms
soon
becomes
unfit
to
drink
and
should
not
be
used
a
drink
of
cold
water
taken
on
going
to

and
another
on
rising
are
conducive
to
health
especially
in
the
case
of

diet
and
tea
and
coffee
these
substances
are
almost
universally
used
as
beverages
and
when
properly
employed
serve
a
purpose
they
quench
thirst
excite
an
agreeable
exhilaration
repress
the
waste
of
the
system
and
supply
nourishment
in
consequence
of
being
generally
used
at
meal
times
their
stimulant
properties
are
employed
to
promote
digestion
and
consequently
they
are
not
so
objectionable
as
they
might
otherwise
be
the
liquids
introduced
into
the
stomach
at
meal
times
should
not
be
cold
tea
and
coffee
are
drunk
warm
while
water
except
in
a
few
instances
is
always
drunk
cold
the
effects
of
which
have
already
been
shown
that
their
inordinate
use
may
be
injurious
no
body
can
deny
but
this
is
equally
true
of
other
beverages
even
pure
cold
water
scientific
investigators
inform
us
that
the
use
of
these
agents
as
beverages
when
judiciously
employed
is
not
injurious
it
has
been
urged
that
they
are
poisonous
but
if
they
are
they
are
very
slow
in
their
operation
when
properly
prepared
they
are
very
agreeable
beverages
and
as
man
will
drink
more
or
less
at
meals
they
are
allowable
for
if
their
use
were
excluded
some
other
beverage
would
be
sought
after
and
quite
likely
one
of
an
alcoholic
character
employed
so
of
two
evils
if
this
be
an
evil
let
us
choose
the
least
unlike
alcoholic
stimulants
they
exhilarate
without
a
depressing
reaction
after
their
influence
has
passed
off
but
one
cup
should
be
drunk
at
a
meal
and
it
should
be
of
moderate
strength
the
use
of
large
quantities
of
drink
at
meals
retards
digestion
by
diluting
the
digestive
fluids
the
excessive
use
of
large
quantities
of
strong
tea
or
coffee
stimulates
the
brain
and
causes
wakefulness
and
produces
irritability
of
the
nervous
system
when
they
are
productive
of
such
effects
their
use
is
injurious
and
should
be
considerably
moderated
or
wholly
discontinued
no
criterion
can
be
given
by
which
the
amount
the
system
will
tolerate
can
be
regulated
what
one
person
may
take
with
impunity
may
be
deleterious
to
an
other
individuals
differ
greatly
in
this
respect
there
are
some
who
can
not
tolerate
them
at
all
either
because
of
some
peculiarity
of
constitution
or
on
account
of
disease
and
sometimes
when
tea
is
agreeable
and
beneficial
coffee
disagrees
with
the
individual
and
persons
of
nervous
habits
whether
natural
or
acquired
are
apt
to
find
their
wakefulness
and
irritability
increased
by
the
use
of
tea
particularly
if
strong
while
coffee
will
have
a
tranquilizing
effect
persons
of
a
lymphatic
or
bilious
temperament
often
find
that
coffee
disagrees
with
them
aggravating
their
troubles
and
causing
biliousness
constipation
and
headache
while
tea
proves
agreeable
and
beneficial
whenever
they
disagree
with
the
system
the
best
rule
is
to
abandon
their
use
we
find
many
persons
who
do
not
use
either
and
yet
enjoy
health
a
fact
which
proves
that
they
are
not
by
any
means
indispensable
and
no
doubt
were
it
customary
to
go
without
them
their
absence
would
be
but
slightly
missed
tea
and
coffee
are
adulterated
to
a
very
great
extent
and
persons
using
them
will
be
greatly
imposed
upon
this
is
an
evil
we
can
not
remedy
if
people
make
use
of
them
their
experience
in
selecting
them
must
be
their
guide
however
it
is
believed
that
the
black

is
a
universal
intoxicant
and
in

higher
orders
of
animals
is
capable
of
inducing
the
most
systematic
phenomena
of

it
is
reserved
for
man
himself
to
exhibit
these
phenomena
in

form

to
present
through
them
in

a
distinct
pathology

as
this
is
it
might

of

should

researches
have
shown
that
the
proportion
of
half
a
drachm
of
alcohol
to
the
pound
weight
of
the
body
is
the
quantity
which
usually
produces
intoxication
and
that
an
increase
of
this
amount
to
one
drachm
immediately
endangers
the
life
of
the
individual
the
first
symptom
which
attracts
attention
when
alcohol
commences
to
take
effect
upon
the
body
is
an
increase
in
the
number
of
the
pulsations
of
the
heart
parkes
and
count
wolowicz
conducted
a
series
of
interesting
experiments
on
young
adult
men
they
counted
the
pulsations
of
the
heart
at
regular
intervals
during
periods
when
the
subject
drank
only
water
and
then
they
counted
the
beats
of
the
heart
in
the
same
individual
during
successive
periods
in
which
alcohol
was
drunk
in
increasing
quantities
the
following
details
are
taken
from
their
report
the
highest
of
the
daily
means
of
the
pulse
observed
during
the
first
or
water
period
was
but
on
this
day
two
observations
were
deficient
the
next
highest
daily
mean
was
beats
if
instead
of
the
mean
of
the
eight
days
or
we
compare
the
mean
of
this
one
day
beats
per
minute
with
the
alcoholic
days
so
as
to
be
sure
not
to
the
action
of
the
alcohol
we
find
on
the
ninth
day
with
one
fluid
ounce
of
alcohol
the
heart
beat
times
more
on
the
tenth
day
with
two
fluid
ounces
times
more
on
the
eleventh
day
with
four
fluid
ounces
times
more
on
the
twelfth
day
with
six
fluid
ounces
times
more
on
the
thirteenth
day
with
eight
fluid
ounces
times
more
on
the
fourteenth
day
with
eight
fluid
ounces
times
more
but
as
there
was
ephemeral
fever
on
the
twelfth
day
it
is
right
to
make
a
deduction
and
to
estimate
the
number
of
beats
in
that
day
as
midway
between
the
twelfth
and
days
or
adopting
this
the
mean
daily
excess
of
beats
during
the
alcoholic
days
was
or
an
increase
of
rather
more
than
thirteen
per
cent
the
first
day
of
alcohol
gave
an
excess
of
one
per
and
the
last
of
per
cent
and
the
mean
of
these
two
gives
almost
the
same
percentage
of
excess
as
the
mean
of
the
six
days
admitting
that
each
beat
of
the
heart
was
as
strong
during
the
alcoholic
as
in
the
water
period
and
it
was
really
more
powerful
the
heart
on
the
last
two
days
of
alcohol
was
doing
more
work
adopting
the
lowest
estimate
which
has
been
given
of
the
daily
work
done
by
the
heart
as
equal
to
tons
lifted
one
foot
the
heart
during
the
alcoholic
period
did
daily
work
in
excess
equal
to
lifting
tons
one
foot
and
in
the
last
two
days
did
extra
work
to
the
amount
of
tons
lifted
as
far
the
period
of
rest
for
the
heart
was
shortened
though
perhaps
not
to
such
an
extent
as
would
be
inferred
from
the
number
of
beats
for
each
contraction
was
sooner
over
the
beat
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
days
after
alcohol
was
left
off
and
apparently
at
the
time
when
the
last
traces
of
alcohol
were
eliminated
showed
in
the
sphygmographic
tracing
signs
of
unusual
feebleness
and
perhaps
in
consequence
of
this
when
the
brandy
quickened
the
heart
again
the
tracing
showed
a
more
rapid
contraction
of
the
ventricles
but
less
power
than
in
the
alcoholic
period
the
brandy
acted
in
fact
on
a
heart
whose
nutrition
had
not
been
perfectly
restored
the
flush
often
seen
on
the
cheeks
of
those
who
are
under
the
influence
of
alcoholic
liquors
and
which
is
produced
by
a
relaxed
and
distended
condition
of
the
superficial
blood
vessels
is
erroneously
supposed
by
many
to
merely
extend
to
the
parts
exposed
to
view
on
this
subject
richardson
says
if
the
lungs
could
be
seen
they
too
would
be
found
with
their
vessels
injected
if
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
could
be
laid
open
to
view
they
would
be
discovered
in
the
same
condition
if
the
stomach
the
liver
the
spleen
the
kidneys
or
any
other
vascular
organs
or
parts
could
be
laid
open
to
the
eye
the
vascular
engorgement
would
be
equally
manifest
in
the
lower
animals
i
have
been
able
to
witness
this
extreme
vascular
condition
in
the
lungs
and
once
i
had
the
unusual
though
unhappy
opportunity
of
observing
the
same
phenomenon
in
the
brain
of
a
man
who
in
a
paroxysm
of
alcoholic
delirium
cast
himself
under
the
wheels
of
a
railway
carriage
the
brain
instantaneously
thrown
out
from
the
skull
by
the
crash
was
before
me
within
three
minutes
after
the
accident
it
exhaled
the
odor
of
spirit
most
distinctly
and
its
membranes
and
minute
structures
were
vascular
in
the
extreme
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
recently
injected
with
vermilion
injection
the
white
matter
of
the
cerebrum
studded
with
red
points
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
when
it
was
incised
it
was
so
preternaturally
red
and
the
pia
mater
or
internal
vascular
membrane
covering
the
brain
resembled
a
delicate
web
of
coagulated
red
blood
so
tensely
were
its
fine
vessels
engorged
this
condition
extended
through
both
the
larger
and
the
smaller
brain
cerebrum
and
cerebellum
but
was
not
so
marked
in
the
medulla
or
commencing
portion
of
the
spinal
cord
as
in
the
other
portions
in
course
of
time
in
persons
accustomed
to
alcohol
the
vascular
changes
temporary
only
in
the
novitiate
become
confirmed
and
permanent
the
bloom
on
the
nose
which
characterizes
the
genial
toper
is
the
established
sign
of
alcoholic
action
on
the
vascular
structure
recently
physiological
research
has
served
to
explain
the
reason
why
under
alcohol
the
heart
at
first
beats
so
quickly
why
the
pulse
rises
and
why
the
minute
become
so
strongly
injected
at
one
time
it
was
imagined
that
alcohol
acts
immediately
upon
the
heart
by
stimulating
it
to
increased
motion
and
from
this
idea
false
idea
i
should
say
of
the
primary
action
of
alcohol
many
erroneous
conclusions
have
been
drawn
we
have
now
learned
that
there
exist
many
chemical
bodies
which
act
in
the
same
manner
as
alcohol
and
that
their
effect
is
not
to
stimulate
the
heart
but
to
weaken
the
contractile
force
of
the
extreme
and
minute
vessels
which
the
heart
fills
with
blood
at
each
of
its
strokes
these
bodies
produce
in
fact
a
paralysis
of
the
organic
nervous
supply
of
the
vessels
which
constitute
the
minute
vascular
structures
the
minute
vessels
when
paralysed
offer
inefficient
resistance
to
the
force
of
the
heart
and
the
pulsating
organ
thus
liberated
like
the
of
a
clock
from
which
the
resistance
has
been
removed
quickens
in
action
dilating
the
feebly
resistant
vessels
and
giving
evidence
really
not
of
increased
but
of
wasted
power
the
continued
use
of
alcoholic
liquors
in
any
considerable
quantity
produces
irritation
and
inflammation
of
the
stomach
and
structural
disease
of
the
liver
hammond
has
shown
that
alcohol
has
a
special
affinity
for
nervous
matter
and
is
therefore
found
in
greater
quantity
in
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
than
elsewhere
in
the
body
the
gray
matter
of
the
brain
undergoes
to
a
certain
extent
a
fatty
degeneration
and
there
is
a
shrinking
of
the
whole
cerebrum
with
impairment
of
the
intellectual
faculties
muscular
tremor
and
a
shambling
gait
large
doses
of
alcohol
cause
a
diminution
of
the
temperature
of
the
body
which
in
fevers
is
more
marked
than
in
the
normal
state
in
addition
to
the
organic
diseases
enumerated
above
and
delirium
tremens
the
following
diseases
are
frequently
the
result
of
the
excessive
use
of
alcoholic
liquors
epilepsy
paralysis
insanity
diabetes
gravel
and
diseases
of
the
heart
and
the
physiological
deductions
of
richardson
are
so
much
in
accord
with
our
own
that
we
quote
them
in
full
in
the
first
place
we
gather
from
the
physiological
reading
of
the
action
of
alcohol
that
the
agent
is
narcotic
i
have
compared
it
throughout
to
chloroform
and
the
comparison
is
good
in
all
respects
save
one
viz
that
alcohol
is
less
fatal
than
chloroform
as
an
instant
destroyer
it
kills
certainly
in
its
own
way
but
its
method
of
killing
is
slow
indirect
and
by
disease
the
fact
that
alcohol
when
it
is
taken
into
the
body
reduces
the
animal
temperature
is
full
of
the
most
important
suggestions
the
fact
shows
that
alcohol
does
not
in
any
sense
act
as
a
supplier
of
vital
heat
as
is
commonly
supposed
and
that
it
does
not
prevent
the
loss
of
heat
as
those
imagine
take
just
a
drop
to
keep
out
the
cold
it
shows
on
the
contrary
that
cold
and
alcohol
in
their
effects
on
the
body
run
closely
together
an
opinion
confirmed
by
the
experience
of
those
who
live
or
travel
in
cold
regions
of
the
earth
the
experiences
of
the
arctic
voyagers
of
the
leaders
of
the
great
napoleonic
campaigns
in
russia
of
the
good
monks
of
bernard
all
testify
that
death
from
cold
is
accelerated
by
its
ally
alcohol
experiments
with
alcohol
in
extreme
cold
tell
the
like
story
while
the
chilliness
of
the
body
which
succeeds
upon
even
a
moderate
excess
of
alcoholic
indulgence
leads
directly
to
the
same
indication
of
truth
the
conclusive
evidence
now
in
our
possession
that
alcohol
taken
into
the
animal
body
sets
free
the
heart
so
as
to
cause
the
excess
of
motion
of
which
the
record
has
been
given
above
is
proof
that
the
heart
under
the
frequent
influence
of
alcohol
must
undergo
deleterious
change
of
structure
it
may
indeed
be
admitted
in
proper
fairness
that
when
the
heart
is
passing
through
these
rapid
movements
it
is
working
under
less
pressure
than
when
its
movements
are
slow
and
natural
and
this
allowance
must
needs
be
made
or
the
inference
would
be
that
the
organ
ought
to
stop
at
once
in
function
by
the
excess
of
strain
put
upon
it
at
the
same
time
the
excess
of
motion
is
injurious
to
the
heart
and
to
the
body
at
large
it
subjects
the
heart
to
irregularity
of
supply
of
blood
it
subjects
the
body
in
all
its
parts
to
the
same
injurious
influence
it
weakens
and
as
a
necessary
sequence
degrades
both
the
heart
and
the
body
speaking
honestly
i
can
not
by
any
argument
yet
presented
to
me
admit
the
alcohols
by
any
sign
that
should
distinguish
them
from
other
chemical
substances
of
the
paralysing
narcotic
class
when
it
is
physiologically
understood
that
what
is
called
stimulation
or
excitement
is
in
absolute
fact
a
relaxation
a
partial
paralysis
of
one
of
the
most
important
mechanisms
in
the
animal
body
the
minute
resisting
compensating
circulation
we
grasp
quickly
the
error
in
respect
to
the
action
of
stimulants
in
which
we
have
been
educated
and
obtain
a
clear
solution
of
the
experience
that
all
excitement
all
passion
leaves
after
its
departure
lowness
of
heart
depression
of
mind
sadness
of
spirit
we
learn
then
in
respect
to
alcohol
that
the
temporary
excitement
it
produces
is
at
the
expense
of
the
animal
force
and
that
the
ideas
of
its
being
necessary
to
resort
to
it
that
it
may
lift
up
the
forces
of
the
animal
body
into
true
and
firm
and
even
activity
or
that
it
may
add
something
useful
to
the
living
tissues
are
errors
as
solemn
as
they
are
widely
disseminated
in
the
scientific
education
of
the
people
no
fact
is
more
deserving
of
special
comment
than
this
fact
that
excitement
is
wasted
force
the
running
down
of
the
animal
mechanism
before
it
has
served
out
its
time
of
motion
it
will
be
said
that
alcohol
cheers
the
weary
and
that
to
take
a
little
wine
for
the
stomach
sake
is
one
of
the
lessons
that
comes
from
the
deep
recesses
of
human
nature
i
am
not
so
obstinate
as
to
deny
this
argument
there
are
times
in
the
life
of
man
when
the
heart
is
oppressed
when
the
resistance
to
its
motion
is
excessive
and
when
blood
flows
languidly
to
the
centres
of
life
nervous
and
muscular
in
these
moments
alcohol
cheers
it
lets
loose
the
heart
from
its
oppression
it
lets
flow
a
brisker
current
of
blood
into
the
failing
organs
it
aids
nutritive
changes
and
altogether
is
of
temporary
service
to
man
so
far
alcohol
may
be
good
and
if
its
use
could
be
limited
to
this
one
action
this
one
purpose
it
would
be
amongst
the
most
excellent
of
the
gifts
of
science
to
mankind
unhappily
the
border
line
between
this
use
and
the
abuse
of
it
the
temptation
to
extend
beyond
the
use
the
habit
to
apply
the
use
when
it
is
not
wanted
as
readily
as
when
it
is
wanted
overbalance
in
the
multitude
of
men
the
temporary
value
that
attaches
truly
to
alcohol
as
a
physiological
agent
hence
alcohol
becomes
a
dangerous
instrument
even
in
the
hands
of
the
strong
and
wise
a
murderous
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
foolish
and
weak
used
too
frequently
used
too
excessively
this
agent
which
in
moderation
cheers
the
failing
body
relaxes
its
vessels
too
extremely
spoils
vital
organs
makes
the
force
of
the
circulation
slow
imperfect
irregular
suggests
the
call
for
more
stimulation
tempts
to
renewal
of
the
evil
and
ruins
the
mechanism
of
the
healthy
animal
before
its
hour
for
ruin
by
natural
decay
should
be
at
all
near
it
is
assumed
by
most
persons
that
alcohol
gives
strength
and
we
hear
feeble
persons
saying
daily
that
they
are
being
up
by
stimulants
this
means
actually
that
they
are
being
kept
down
but
the
sensation
they
derive
from
the
immediate
action
of
the
stimulant
deceives
them
and
leads
them
to
attribute
passing
good
to
what
in
the
large
majority
of
cases
is
persistent
evil
the
evidence
is
that
alcohol
gives
no
potential
power
to
brain
or
muscle
during
the
first
stage
of
action
it
may
enable
a
wearied
or
a
feeble
organism
to
do
brisk
work
for
a
short
time
it
may
make
the
mind
briefly
brilliant
it
may
excite
muscle
to
quick
action
but
it
does
nothing
substantially
and
fills
up
nothing
it
has
destroyed
as
it
leads
to
destruction
a
fire
makes
a
brilliant
sight
but
leaves
a
desolation
it
is
the
same
with
alcohol
on
the
muscular
force
the
very
slightest
excess
of
alcoholic
influence
is
injurious
i
find
by
measuring
the
power
of
muscle
for
contraction
in
the
natural
state
and
under
alcohol
that
so
soon
as
there
is
a
distinct
indication
of
muscular
disturbance
there
is
also
indication
of
muscular
failure
and
if
i
wished
by
scientific
experiment
to
spoil
for
work
the
most
perfect
specimen
of
a
working
animal
say
a
horse
without
inflicting
mechanical
injury
i
could
choose
no
better
agent
for
the
purpose
of
the
experiment
than
alcohol
but
alas
the
readiness
with
which
strong
men
slip
into
general
paralysis
under
the
continued
influence
of
this
false
support
attests
how
unnecessary
it
would
be
to
subject
a
lower
animal
to
the
experiment
the
experiment
is
a
custom
and
man
is
the
subject
the
true
place
of
alcohol
is
clear
it
is
an
agreeable
temporary
shroud
the
savage
with
the
mansions
of
his
soul
unfurnished
buries
his
restless
energy
under
its
shadow
the
civilized
man
overburdened
with
mental
labor
or
with
engrossing
care
seeks
the
same
shade
but
it
is
shade
after
all
in
which
in
exact
proportion
as
he
seeks
it
the
seeker
retires
from
perfect
natural
life
to
search
for
force
in
alcohol
is
to
my
mind
equivalent
to
the
act
of
seeking
for
the
sun
in
subterranean
gloom
until
all
is
night
it
may
be
urged
that
men
take
alcohol
nevertheless
take
it
freely
and
yet
live
that
the
adult
swede
drinks
his
average
cup
of
gallons
of
alcohol
per
year
and
remains
on
the
face
of
the
earth
i
admit
force
even
in
this
argument
for
i
know
under
the
persistent
use
of
alcohol
there
is
a
limited
provision
for
the
continuance
of
life
in
the
confirmed
alcoholic
the
alcohol
is
in
a
certain
sense
so
disposed
of
that
it
fits
as
it
were
the
body
for
a
long
season
nay
becomes
part
of
it
and
yet
it
is
silently
doing
its
fatal
work
the
organs
of
the
body
may
be
slowly
brought
into
a
state
of
adaptation
to
receive
it
and
to
dispose
of
it
but
in
that
very
preparation
they
are
themselves
made
to
undergo
physical
changes
tending
to
the
destruction
of
their
function
to
perversion
of
their
structure
and
to
all
those
varied
modifications
of
organic
parts
which
the
dissector
of
the
human
subject
learns
to
recognize
almost
without
concern
and
certainly
without
anything
more
than
commonplace
curiosity
as
the
devastations
incident
to
alcoholic
indulgence
the
statistics
collected
from
the
census
of
the
united
states
for
and
given
by
de
marmon
in
the
york
medical
for
december
must
carry
conviction
to
all
minds
of
the
correctness
of
the
foregoing
deductions
for
the
last
ten
years
the
use
of
spirits
has
imposed
on
the
nation
a
direct
expense
of

has
caused
an
indirect

of

worth
of

has
made
widows
and
orphans
if
these
were
the
statistics
years
ago
with
our
greatly
increased
population
what
must
they
be
we
will
let
the
reader
draw
his
own
conclusions
malted
liquors
under
this
head
are
included
all
those
liquors
into
the
composition
of
which
malt
enters
such
as
beer
ale
and
porter
the
proportion
of
alcohol
in
these
liquors
varies
greatly
in
beer
it
is
from
two
to
five
per
cent
in
edinburgh
ale
it
amounts
to
six
per
cent
in
porter
it
is
usually
from
four
to
six
per
cent
in
addition
to
alcohol
and
water
the
malted
liquors
contain
from
five
to
fourteen
per
cent
of
the
extract
of
malt
and
from
to
per
cent
of
carbonic
acid
they
possess
according
to
pereira
three
properties
they
quench
thirst
they
stimulate
cheer
and
if
taken
in
sufficient
quantity
intoxicate
and
they
nourish
or
strengthen
the
first
of
these
qualities
is
due
to
the
water
entering
into
their
composition
the
second
to
the
alcohol
the
third
is
attributed
the
nutritive
principles
of
the
malt
objections
to
their
use
as
beverages
these
articles
are
either
pure
or
adulterated
in
their
pure
state
the
objection
to
their
use
for
this
purpose
lies
in
the
fact
that
they
contain
alcohol
this
as
we
have
seen
is
a
poisonous
substance
which
the
human
system
in
a
state
of
health
does
not
need
its
use
when
the
body
is
in
a
normal
condition
is
uncalled
for
and
can
only
be
deleterious
beverages
containing
this
poison
are
more
or
less
deleterious
to
healthy
persons
according
to
the
amount
of
it
which
they
contain
these
liquors
are
frequently
adulterated
and
this
increases
their
injurious
effects
the
ingenuity
of
man
has
been
taxed
to
increase
their
intoxicating
properties
to
heighten
the
color
and
flavor
to
create
pungency
and
thirst
and
to
revive
old
beer
to
increase
the
intoxicating
power
tobacco
or
the
seeds
of
the
cocculus
indicus
are
added
to
heighten
the
color
and
flavor
burnt
sugar
liquorice
or
treacle
quassia
or
strychnine
coriander
and
caraway
seeds
are
employed
to
increase
the
pungency
cayenne
pepper
or
common
salt
is
added
to
revive
old
beer
or
ale
it
is
shaken
up
with
green
vitriol
or
sulphate
of
iron
or
with
alum
and
common
salt
fermented
liquors
these
are
cider
and
wine
cider
contains
alcohol
to
the
amount
of
from
five
to
ten
per
saccharine
matter
lactic
acid
and
other
substances
new
cider
may
be
drunk
in
large
quantities
without
inducing
intoxication
but
old
cider
is
quite
as
intoxicating
as
ale
or
porter
the
composition
of
wine
is
very
complex
the
peculiar
qualities
which
characterize
the
different
varieties
can
not
be
ascertained
by
chemical
analysis
wine
is
a
solution
of
alcohol
in
water
combined
with
various
constituents
of
the
grape
the
amount
of
alcohol
in
wines
ranges
from
six
to
forty
per
cent
as
beverages
these
are
open
to
the
same
objections
as
those
manufactured
from
malt
as
a
medicine
wine
is
a
useful
remedy
concerning
its
use
in
this
capacity
liebig
says
wine
is
a
restorative
as
a
means
of
refreshment
when
the
powers
of
life
are
exhausted
as
a
means
of
compensation
where
a
misappropriation
occurs
in
nutrition
and
as
a
means
of
protection
against
transient
organic
disturbances
it
is
surpassed
by
no
product
of
nature
or
art
that
an
article
is
useful
in
medicine
however
is
no
reason
why
it
should
be
used
as
a
beverage
by
those
in
health
it
is
rather
an
argument
against
such
a
practice
for
it
is
generally
true
that
the
drugs
used
to
restore
the
diseased
system
to
health
are
pernicious
or
poisonous
to
it
when
in
a
normal
condition
distilled
liquors
these
are
whiskey
brandy
and
the
kindred
productions
of
the
still
whiskey
is
a
solution
of
alcohol
in
water
mixed
with
various
other
principles
which
impart
to
it
peculiar
physical
properties
the
amount
of
alcohol
which
it
contains
varies
from
to
per
cent
old
whiskey
is
more
highly
prized
than
the
more
recent
product
of
the
still
from
the
fact
that
when
kept
for
some
years
certain
volatile
oils
are
generated
which
impart
to
it
a
mellowness
of
flavor
brandy
is
a
solution
of
alcohol
in
water
together
with
various
other
substances
it
contains
from
fifty
to
per
cent
of
alcohol
pure
brandy
is
distilled
from
wine
gallons
of
wine
yielding
from
to
gallons
of
brandy
but
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
brandy
is
made
with
little
or
no
wine
it
is
made
artificially
from
high
wines
by
the
addition
of
oil
of
cognac
to
give
it
flavor
burnt
sugar
to
give
it
color
and
logwood
or
catechu
to
impart
astringency
and
roughness
of
taste
the
best
brandy
is
obtained
by
distillation
from
the
best
quality
of
white
wines
from
the
districts
of
cognac
and
armagnac
in
france
the
clothing
there
is
no
physical
agent
which
exerts
a
more
constant
or
more
powerful
influence
upon
health
and
life
than
the
atmosphere
the
climate
in
these
latitudes
is
exceedingly
variable
ranging
all
the
way
from
fahr
in
summer
to
below
zero
in
the
winter
season
the
body
of
every
individual
should
be
so
protected
from
cold
that
it
can
maintain
a
mean
temperature
of
fahr
when
the
body
is
warm
there
is
a
free
and
equal
circulation
of
the
blood
throughout
all
the
structures
when
the
surface
is
subjected
to
cold
the
numerous
capillaries
and
minute
vessels
carrying
the
blood
contract
and
diminish
in
size
increasing
the
amount
of
this
fluid
in
the
internal
organs
thus
causing
congestion
the
blood
must
go
somewhere
and
if
driven
from
the
surface
it
retreats
to
the
cavities
within
hence
this
repletion
of
the
vital
organs
causes
pain
from
pressure
and
fullness
of
the
distended
and
the
organic
functions
are
embarrassed
besides
cold
upon
the
surface
shuts
up
the
pores
of
the
skin
which
are
among
the
most
active
and
important
excretory
ducts
of
the
system
it
is
evident
then
that
we
require
suitable
clothing
not
only
for
comfort
but
to
maintain
the
temperature
and
functions
essential
to
health
and
life
the
chief
object
to
be
attained
by
dress
is
the
maintenance
of
a
uniform
temperature
of
the
body
to
attain
this
end
it
is
necessary
that
the
exhalations
of
the
system
which
are
continually
escaping
through
the
pores
of
the
skin
should
be
absorbed
or
conducted
away
from
the
person
these
exudations
occur
in
the
form
of
sensible
or
insensible
perspiration
and
the
clothing
to
be
healthy
should
be
so
porous
as
to
allow
them
freely
to
escape
into
the
air
a
substance
should
also
be
chosen
which
is
known
to
be
a
poor
conductor
of
heat
that
generated
by
the
system
will
thus
be
retained
where
it
is
needed
instead
of
being
dispersed
into
the
atmosphere
we
might
add
that
the
better
the
material
for
accomplishing
these
purposes
the
less
will
be
needed
to
be
worn
for
we
do
not
wish
to
wear
or
carry
about
with
us
any
more
material
than
is
necessary
it
so
happens
that
all
of
these
qualities
are
found
combined
in
the
value
of
this
article
worn
next
to
the
skin
can
not
be
for
while
it
affords
protection
from
cold
during
the
winter
months
it
is
equally
beneficial
during
the
heat
of
summer
because
it
imbibes
the
perspiration
and
being
very
porous
allows
it
to
escape
the
skin
always
feels
soft
smooth
and
pliable
when
it
is
worn
but
when
cotton
takes
its
place
it
soon
becomes
dry
and
harsh
its
natural
adaptability
to
these
purposes
shows
that
it
is
equally
a
comfort
and
a
source
of
health
where
the
skin
is
very
delicate
flannel
sometimes
causes
irritation
in
such
cases
a
thin
fabric
of
linen
cotton
or
silk
should
be
worn
next
the
skin
with
flannel
immediately
over
it
where
there
is
a
uniform
and
extreme
degree
of
heat
cotton
and
linen
are
very
conducive
to
comfort
but
they
are
unsuitable
in
a
climate
or
season
liable
to
sudden
fluctuations
in
temperature
the
value
of
furs
where
people
are
exposed
to
extreme
cold
can
not
be
overestimated
they
are
much
warmer
than
wool
and
are
chiefly
used
as
wraps
on
going
outdoors
they
are
too
cumbrous
and
expensive
for
ordinary
wear
in
this
latitude
but
in
places
near
the
poles
they
constitute
the
chief
clothing
of
the
inhabitants
the
quantity
of
clothing
worn
is
another
important
item
the
least
that
is
necessary
to
keep
the
body
well
protected
and
evenly
tempered
when
employed
is
the
rule
of
health
some
people
instead
of
wearing
flannels
next
to
the
body
put
on
other
material
in
greater
abundance
thus
confining
the
perspiration
to
the
skin
and
making
the
body
chilly
the
amount
of
clothing
is
then
increased
until
they
are
so
heavily
clad
that
they
can
not
exercise
it
is
far
better
to
wear
one
thickness
of
flannel
next
to
the
skin
and
then
cotton
or
woolen
for
outside
garments
and
be
able
to
exercise
thus
allowing
the
blood
to
circulate
and
to
assist
in
the
warming
process
one
great
fault
in
dress
consists
in
neglecting
to
properly
clothe
the
upper
extremities
some
people
do
not
reflect
upon
the
necessity
while
others
are
too
proud
to
be
directed
by
plain
common
sense
in
the
winter
season
the
feet
should
be
covered
with
woolen
stockings
the
next
matter
of
importance
is
to
get
a
thick
shoe
so
large
that
it
will
not
prevent
the
free
circulation
of
the
blood
then
for
walking
and
especially
for
riding
when
the
earth
is
wet
and
cold
or
when
there
is
snow
on
the
ground
wear
a
rubber
or
arctic
sure
and
keep
the
feet
comfortable
and
warm
at
all
our
next
advice
is
to
keep
the
legs
warm
we
were
called
not
long
ago
to
see
a
young
lady
who
had
contracted
a
severe
cold
she
had
been
to
an
entertainment
where
the
apartments
were
nicely
warmed
and
from
thence
had
walked
home
late
in
the
evening
we
inquired
into
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
ascertained
that
she
wore
flannel
about
her
chest
and
that
she
also
wore
rubbers
over
her
shoes
but
the
other
portions
of
the
lower
extremities
were
protected
by
cotton
coverings
in
short
her
legs
were
not
kept
warm
and
she
took
cold
by
going
out
from
warm
rooms
into
a
chilly
atmosphere
a
good
pair
of
woolen
leggings
might
have
saved
her
much
suffering
the
results
of
insufficient
protection
of
the
lower
extremities
are
colds
coughs
consumption
headaches
pain
in
the
side
menstrual
derangements
uterine
congestion
and
disorders
besides
disablement
for
the
ordinary
and
necessary
duties
of
life
all
these
may
be
prevented
by
clothing
the
legs
suitably
and
wearing
comfortable
flannels
young
people
can
bear
a
low
temperature
of
the
body
better
than
old
people
because
they
possess
greater
power
of
endurance
but
that
is
no
reason
for
unnecessary
exposure
the
amount
of
clothing
should
be
regulated
according
to
the
power
of
the
individual
and
also
according
to
the
susceptibility
to
cold
no
two
persons
are
exactly
alike
in
these
respects
but
it
is
never
proper
for
young
people
to
reject
the
counsels
of
experience
or
treat
lightly
the
advice
to
protect
themselves
thoroughly
against
the
cold
many
a
parent
heart
has
ached
as
he
has
followed
the
mortal
remains
of
a
darling
child
to
the
grave
knowing
that
if
good
advice
had
been
heeded
in
all
human
probability
the
life
would
have
been
prolonged
the
most
deleterious
mechanical
errors
in
clothing
are
those
which
affect
the
chest
and
body
tight
lacing
still
plays
too
important
a
part
in
dress
it
interferes
with
the
free
and
healthy
movements
of
the
body
and
effects
a
pressure
which
is
alike
injurious
to
the
organs
of
respiration
circulation
and
digestion
the
great
muscle
of
respiration
the
diaphragm
is
impeded
in
its
motion
and
is
therefore
unable
to
act
freely
the
large
are
compressed
and
when
the
pressure
is
excessive
the
heart
and
lungs
are
also
subjected
to
restraint
and
thrown
out
of
their
proper
positions
from
the
compression
of
the
liver
and
stomach
the
functions
of
digestion
are
impeded
a
distaste
for
solid
food
flatulency
and
pain
after
eating
are
the
unmistakable
proofs
of
the
injury
which
is
being
inflicted
the
evil
effects
of
such
pressure
are
not
confined
to
actual
periods
of
time
during
which
this
pressure
is
applied
they
continue
after
it
has
been
removed
and
when
the
chest
and
trunk
of
the
body
have
thus
been
subjected
to
pressure
they
become
permanently
deformed
these
deformities
necessarily
entail
great
suffering
in
the
evil
effects
of
mechanical
pressure
on
other
parts
of
the
body
are
not
uncommon
the
leg
is
sometimes
so
indented
by
a
tight
garter
that
the
returning
flow
of
blood
through
the
veins
is
prevented
and
a
varicose
condition
of
these
vessels
is
produced
irregular
and
excessive
pressure
on
the
foot
by
imperfectly
fitting
shoes
or
boots
produce
deformities
of
the
feet
and
cause
much
suffering
the
high
heels
which
are
so
common
on
the
shoes
of
women
and
children
inflict
more
than
a
local
injury
every
time
the
body
comes
down
upon
the
raised
heel
with
its
full
weight
a
slight
shock
or
vibration
is
communicated
throughout
the
entire
extent
of
the
spinal
column
and
the
nervous
mechanism
is
thereby
injured
furthermore
displacements
of
the
pelvic
organs
frequently
result
from
these
unnatural
and
absurd
articles
of
dress
women
of
fashion
are
subjected
to
much
annoyance
from
wearing
long
flowing
skirts
suspended
from
their
waists

if

us

any
literary
occupation
is
very
essential
the
pursuit
of
the
most
abstruse
studies
will
thus
become
habitual
and
comparatively
easy
a
consequence
of
systematic
application
mental
labor
should
always
cease
when
the
train
of
thought
becomes
confused
and
there
is
the
slightest
sensation
of
depression
all
distracting
influences
should
be
absent
from
the
mind
in
order
to
facilitate
intense
study
for
the
intellect
can
not
attend
perfectly
to
two
subjects
at
the
same
time
painful
sensations
always
have
a
tendency
to
paralyze
mental
exertion
great
care
should
be
taken
that
the
head
is
not
subjected
to
injury
of
any
kind
as
it
is
almost
invariably
accompanied
by
some
nervous
derangement
exposure
to
extreme
heat
should
be
carefully
avoided

sleep
for
all
animated
beings
sleep
is
an
imperious
necessity
as
indispensable
as
food
the
welfare
of
man
requires
alternate
periods
of
activity
and
repose
it
is
a
physiological
fact
that
during
the
wakeful
hours
the
vital
energies
are
being
expended
the
powers
of
life
diminished
and
if
wakefulness
is
continued
beyond
a
certain
limit
the
system
becomes
enfeebled
and
death
is
the
result
during
sleep
there
is
a
temporary
cessation
of
vital
expenditures
and
a
recuperation
of
all
the
forces
under
the
influence
of
sleep
the
blood
is
refreshed
the
brain
recruited
physical
sufferings
are
extinguished
mental
troubles
are
removed
the
organism
is
relieved
and
hope
returns
to
the
heart
the
severest
punishment
which
can
be
inflicted
upon
a
person
is
to
entirely
deprive
him
of
sleep
in
china
a
few
years
since
three
criminals
were
sentenced
to
be
kept
awake
until
they
should
die
to
do
this
it
was
necessary
to
keep
a
guard
over
them
the
sentinels
were
armed
with
sharp
pointed
instruments
with
which
to
goad
the
victims
and
thus
prevent
them
from
sleeping
life
soon
became
a
burden
and
although
they
were
well
fed
during
the
time
death
occurred
sooner
than
it
would
have
done
had
starvation
been
the
punishment
sleeping
rooms
the
sleeping
room
should
be
large
and
well
ventilated
and
the
air
kept
moderately
cool
the
necessity
for
a
fire
may
be
determined
by
the
health
of
the
occupant
besides
maintaining
a
proper
temperature
in
the
room
a
little
fire
is
useful
especially
if
in
a
grate
for
the
purpose
of
securing
good
ventilation
the
windows
should
not
be
so
arranged
as
to
allow
a
draught
upon
the
body
during
the
night
but
yet
so
adjusted
that
the
inmate
may
obtain
plenty
of
fresh
air
the
bed
should
not
be
too
soft
but
rather
hard
feathers
give
off
animal
emanations
of
an
injurious
character
and
impart
a
feeling
of
lassitude
and
debility
to
those
sleeping
on
them
no
more
coverings
should
be
used
than
are
actually
necessary
for
the
comfort
of
the
individual
cotton
sheets
are
warmer
than
linen
and
answer
equally
as
well
sleeping
alone
certain
effluvia
are
thrown
off
from
our
persons
and
when
two
individuals
sleep
together
each
inhales
from
the
other
more
or
less
of
these
emanations
there
is
little
doubt
that
and
many
other
diseases
not
usually
considered
contagious
are
sometimes
communicated
in
this
manner
when
it
is
not
practicable
for
individuals
to
occupy
separate
beds
the
persons
sleeping
together
should
be
of
about
the
same
age
and
in
good
health
numerous
cases
have
occurred
in
which
healthy
robust
children
have
gradually
declined
and
died
within
a
few
months
from
the
evil
effects
of
sleeping
with
old
people
again
those
in
feeble
health
have
been
greatly
benefited
and
even
restored
by
sleeping
with
others
who
were
young
and
healthy
time
for
sleep
is
the
proper
time
for
sleep
when
day
is
substituted
for
night
the
sleep
obtained
does
not
fully
restore
the
exhausted
energies
of
the
system
nature
does
not
allow
her
laws
to
be
broken
with
impunity
children
require
more
sleep
than
old
persons
they
are
sometimes
stupefied
with
soothing
syrups
and
preparations
of
opium
in
order
to
get
them
temporarily
out
of
the
way
such
narcotics
are
very
injurious
and
dangerous
we
have
known
a
young
child
to
be
killed
by
a
of
laudanum
this
practice
therefore
can
not
be
too
emphatically
condemned
how
to
put
children
to
bed
the
following
characteristic
lines
are
from
the
pen
of
fanny
fern
and
contain
such
good
advice
that
we
can
not
refrain
from
quoting
them
not
with
a
reproof
for
any
of
the
day
sins
of
omission
or
commission
take
any
other
time
than
for
that
if
you
ever
heard
a
little
creature
sighing
or
sobbing
in
its
sleep
you
could
never
do
this
seal
their
closing
eyelids
with
a
kiss
and
a
blessing
the
time
will
come
all
too
soon
when
they
will
lay
their
heads
upon
their
pillows
lacking
both
let
them
at
least
have
this
sweet
memory
of
happy
childhood
of
which
no
future
sorrow
or
trouble
can
rob
them
give
them
their
rosy
youth
nor
need
this
involve
wild
license
the
judicious
parent
will
not
so
mistake
my
meaning
if
you
ever
met
the
man
or
the
woman
whose
eyes
have
suddenly
filled
when
a
little
child
has
crept
trustingly
to
its
mother
breast
you
may
have
seen
one
in
whose
childhood
home
and
stood
where
love
and
pity
should
have
been
too
much
indulgence
has
ruined
thousands
of
children
too
much
love
not
one
position
in
sleep
the
proper
position
in
sleep
is
upon
the
right
side
the
orifice
leading
from
the
stomach
to
the
bowels
being
on
this
side
this
position
favors
the
passage
of
the
contents
into
the
duodenum
lying
on
the
back
is
injurious
since
by
so
doing
the
spine
becomes
heated
especially
if
the
person
sleeps
on
feathers
the
circulation
is
obstructed
and
local
congestions
are
encouraged
the
face
should
never
be
covered
during
sleep
since
it
necessitates
the
breathing
of
the
same
air
over
again
together
with
the
emanations
from
the
body
the
amount
of
sleep
the
amount
of
sleep
required
varies
with
the
age
habits
condition
and
peculiarities
of
the
individual
no
definite
rule
can
be
given
for
the
guidance
of
all
the
average
amount
required
however
is
eight
or
nine
hours
out
of
the
some
persons
need
more
than
this
while
others
can
do
with
less
since
both
body
and
mind
are
recuperated
by
sleep
the
more
they
are
exhausted
the
more
sleep
is
required
a
person
employed
at
mental
labor
should
have
more
than
one
who
is
merely
expending
muscular
strength
six
hours
of
unbroken
sleep
do
more
to
refresh
and
revive
than
ten
when
frequently
interrupted
if
it
is
too
prolonged
it
weakens
and
stupefies
both
body
and
mind
if
an
insufficient
amount
is
taken
the
flagging
energies
are
not
restored
persons
who
eat
much
or
use
stimulants
generally
require
more
than
others
to
sleep
regularity
is
desirable
if
a
person
goes
to
bed
at
a
certain
hour
for
several
nights
in
succession
it
will
soon
become
a
habit
the
same
holds
true
with
regard
to
rising
if
children
are
put
to
sleep
at
a
stated
hour
for
several
days
in
succession
it
will
soon
become
a
habit
with
them
cleanliness
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
and
is
essential
to
the
health
and
vigor
of
the
system
its
importance
can
not
be
overestimated
and
it
should
be
inculcated
early
on
the
minds
of
the
young
even
from
the
body
purity
the
mind
receives
a
secret
sympathetic
aid
when
we
consider
the
functions
of
the
skin
with
its
myriads
of
minute
glands
innumerable
little
tubes
employed
in
removing
the
useless
matter
from
the
system
we
can
not
fail
to
appreciate
the
utility
of
frequent
bathing
with
soap
and
water
unless
these
excretions
are
removed
the
glands
become
obstructed
their
functions
are
arrested
and
unpleasant
odors
arise
many
persons
think
because
they
daily
bathe
the
face
neck
and
hands
dress
the
hair
becomingly
and
remove
the
dirt
from
their
clothing
that
the
height
of
cleanliness
has
been
reached
from
a
hygienic
point
of
view
bathing
the
body
is
of
much
greater
importance
notwithstanding
the
necessity
for
cleanliness
of
the
body
we
occasionally
meet
with
persons
who
although
particular
about
their
personal
appearance
permit
their
bodies
to
be
for
weeks
and
even
months
without
a
bath
such
neglect
should
never
exceed
one
week
plenty
of
sunlight
and
at
least
one
or
two
general
baths
every
week
are
essential
to
perfect
health
cleanliness
is
necessary
to

beauty
attractiveness
and

of
the

the

of
organized
bodies
are
subject
to
continual
alteration
the
changes
of
nutrition

which
are
constantly
taking

in
the

render
them
at
the

the

of

of

of

animal
life
in

manner
comes

fades
and
dies
it
is
therefore
essential
to
the
perpetuation
of
life
that
new
organisms
be
provided
to
take
the
place
of
those
which
are
passing
out
of

there
is
no
physiological
process
which
presents
more
interesting
phenomena
than
that
of
reproduction
which
includes
the
formation
as
well
as
the
development
of
new
beings
since
is
nature
first
law
the
desire
for
food
is
a
most
powerful
instinct
in
all
living
animals
not
inferior
to
this
law
is
that
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
race
and
for
this
purpose
throughout
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
we
find
the
biblical
statement
literally
illustrated

female
created
he
them
health
is
the
gauge
by
which
the
prosperity
of
a
people
may
be
measured
were
we
to
trace
the
history
of
nations
their
rise
and
fall
we
would
find
that
much
of
the
barbarism
and
crime
degradation
and
vice
as
well
as
their
decline
and
final
extinction
was
due
to
licentiousness
and
sexual
excesses
since
there
is
an
intimate
relation
between
mind
and
body
when
the
body
is
enfeebled
the
mind
becomes
enervated
morbid
conditions
of
the
body
prevent
the
highest
mental
development
and
on
the
other
hand
when
the
mind
is
debilitated
general
depravity
physical
as
well
as
mental
is
the
result
the
highest
development
of
the
body
results
from
the
equal
and
harmonious
cultivation
of
all
the
mental
powers
the
perfect
development
and
health
of
the
physical
organs
is
therefore
essential
to
the
happiness
of
mankind
but
before
health
can
be
insured
the
nature
and
general
functions
of
the
physical
system
must
be
understood
this
being
done
the
question
naturally
arises
can
health
be
best
maintained
and
longevity
secured
influence
of
food
we
have
previously
noticed
the
effects
which
food
exercise
and
other
hygienic
agencies
have
upon
digestion
circulation
and
respiration
and
we
find
that
they
exert
a
not
less
potent
influence
upon
the
health
of
the
generative
organs
excessive
stimulation
excites
the
sexual
passions
for
this
reason
children
should
not
be
immoderately
indulged
in
highly
seasoned
foods
those
persons
who
have
great
muscular
vigor
are
endowed
with
violent
passions
and
unless
restrained
by
moral
considerations
are
very
likely
to
be
overcome
by
their
animal
propensities
have
a
debasing
influence
upon
the
whole
system
and
especially
upon
the
sexual
organs
they
excite
the
animal
and
debase
the
moral
nature
they
exhaust
the
vitality
and
after
the
excitement
which
they
temporarily
induce
has
passed
away
the
body
is
left
in
a
prostrated
condition
physical
labor
modifies
the
passions
labor
consumes
the
surplus
vitality
which
a
person
may
possess
and
no
better
protective
can
be
found
against
the
gratification
of
the
passions
unless
it
be
high
moral
training
than
daily
toil
extended
to
such
a
degree
as
to
produce
fatigue
labor
determines
the
blood
to
the
surface
and
to
other
parts
of
the
body
and
prevents
excitement
and
congestion
of
the
sexual
centers
if
by
education
or
association
the
passions
of
children
be
excited
they
will
be
increased
if
on
the
contrary
they
be
taught
to
avoid
these
social
or
solitary
evils
they
will
be
abated
let
them
be
educated
to
work
and
the
intellectual
faculties
will
assert
their
sway
the
moral

the

the

hence
races
that

a

hastens

men

in

that
when

he
becomes

even
barbarous
in
his

thus

to

again
when
the

be
aroused
by
the

a

made
to
convey
an
impression
entirely

by

also
the

may
be
of
such
a
character
as
to
excite
the
sexual
passion
the
manner
in
which
the
apparel
is
worn
is
often
so
conspicuous
as
to
become
bawdy
thereby
appealing
to
the
libidinous

rather
than
awakening

obscene

literature
is
a
powerful
agent
either
for

if

it
not
unfrequently
happens
that
a
child
is
born
with
a
vigorous
mental
organism
which
promises
a
brilliant
future
but
manhood
finds
him
incompetent
debilitated
and
totally
incapacitated
for
mental
or
manual
labor
this
may
be
the
result
of
youthful
indiscretion
ignorantly
committed
but
not
unfrequently
it
is
the
effect
of
a
pernicious
literature
which
inflames
the
imagination
tramples
upon
reason
and
describes
to
the
youth
a
realm
where
the
passions
are
the
ruling
deities
many
persons
are
born
into
the
world
with
disordered

for
which
they
are

there
are
marked
varieties
of
character
in
children
of
the
same
parents
one
manifests
great
precocity
another
is
below
the
average
in
mental
attainments
one
is
amiable
another
irritable
in
disposition
indeed
there
are
often
as
great
differences
between
children
of
the
same
as
of
different
families
this
is
due
to
the
physical
and
mental
conditions
of
the
parents
more
especially
the
mother
not
only
at
the
time
of
the
impregnation
but
also
during
the
period
intervening
between
conception
and
the
birth
of
the
offspring
the
ancients
regarded
courage
as
the
principal
virtue
by
us
purity
is
so
estimated
moral
purity
is
an
essential
requisite
to
the
growth
and
perfection
of
the
character
untold
miseries
arise
from
the
pollution
of
the
body
or
onanism
is
one
of
the
most
prolific
sources
of
evil
since
it
leads
both
to
the
degradation
of
body
and
mind
it
is
practiced
more
or
less
by
members
of
both
sexes
and
the
habit
once
established
is
overcome
with
the
greatest
difficulty
it
is
the
source
of
numerous
diseases
which
derange
the
functional
activity
of
the
organs
involved
and
eventually
impair
the
constitution
this
vicious
habit
is
often
practiced
by
those
who
are
ignorant
of
its
dangerous
results
statistics
show
that
insanity
is
frequently
caused
by
masturbation
immoderate
indulgence
in
any
practice
is
deleterious
to
the
individual
emphatically
true
is
this
with
regard
to
sexual
excesses
not
unfrequently
does
the
marriage
rite
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
the
abuse
of
the
conjugal
relation
produces
the
most
serious
results
to
both
parties
and
is
a
prolific
source
of
some
of
the
gravest
forms
of
disease
prostatorrhea
spermatorrhea
impotency
hypochondria
and
general
debility
of
the
generative
organs
arise
from
sexual
excesses
the
health
of
the
reproductive
organs
can
only
be
maintained
by
leading
a
life
the
food
should
be
nourishing
but
not
stimulating
lascivious
thoughts
should
be
banished
from
the
mind
and
a
taste
cultivated
for
that
literature
which
is
elevating
in
its
nature
and
the
associations
should
be
refining
and
ennobling
let
these
conditions
and
the
rules
of

of

to

is
generally
established
between
the

of

for

a

through

has
caused
derangements
which
have
enfeebled

usually
feel
an
aching

pains
in
the

chilliness
and
general
languor
the
establishment
of
this

relieves
these
symptoms
every
precaution
should
be
taken
during
the
period
to
keep
the
feet
dry
and

chapter
practical
summary
of

the
first
step
which
should
be
taken
for
the
prevention
of
disease
is
to
make
provision
for
the
health
of
the
unborn
child
greater
care
should
be
exercised
with
women
who
are
in
a
way
to
become
mothers
those
who
are
surrounded
by
all
the
luxuries
which
health
can
bestow
indulge
too
much
in
rich
food
and
take
too
little
exercise
while
the
poor
get
too
little
nourishment
and
work
too
hard
and
too
long
a
woman
in
this
condition
should
avoid
and
all
scenes
which
excite
the
passions
or
powerful
emotions
she
should
take
moderate
exercise
in
the
open
air
eat
moderately
of
wholesome
food
and
of
meat
not
oftener
than
twice
a
day
take
tea
or
coffee
in
limited
quantities
and
avoid
the
use
of
all
alcoholic
liquors
she
should
go
to
bed
early
and
take
not
less
than
nine
hours
sleep
her
clothing
should
be
loose
light
in
weight
and
warm
she
should
take
every
precaution
against
exposure
to
contagious
or
infectious
diseases
there
is
no
better
method
for
preventing
the
spread
of
contagious
diseases
than
perfect
isolation
of
the
infected
and
thorough
disinfection
of
all
articles
of
clothing
or
bedding
which
have
been
in
contact
with
the
infected
many
persons
erroneously
believe
that
every
child
must
necessarily
have
the
measles
and
other
contagious
diseases
and
they
therefore
take
no
precautions
against
the
exposure
of
their
children
the
liability
to
infection
diminishes
as
age
advances
and
those
individuals
are
as
a
rule
the
strongest
and
best
developed
who
have
never
suffered
from
any
of
the
contagious
diseases
although
vaccination
is
the
great
safeguard
yet
it
should
never
prevent
the
immediate
isolation
of
those
who
are
suffering
from
this
disease
to
avoid
the
injurious
effects
of
impure
air
the
following
rules
should
be
carefully
observed
the
admission
of
air
which
contains
anything
that
emits
an
unpleasant
odor
into
closed
rooms
should
be
avoided
the
temperature
of
every
apartment
should
be
kept
as
near
fahr
as
possible
and
the
air
should
not
be
overcharged
with
watery
vapor
provisions
should
be
made
for
the
free
admission
into
and
escape
of
air
from
the
room
at
all
times
when
an
apartment
is
not
in
use
it
should
be
thoroughly
ventilated
by
opening
the
windows
those
who
are
compelled
to
remain
in
an
atmosphere
tilled
with
dust
should
wear
a
respirator
to
insure
a
healthy
condition
of
the
body
the
diet
of
man
ought
to
be
varied
and
all
excesses
should
be
avoided
the
total
amount
of
solid
food
taken
in
the
hours
should
not
exceed
two
and
a
half
pounds
and
not
more
than
of
this
quantity
should
consist
of
animal
food
many
persons
do
not
require
more
than
one
pound
and
a
half
of
mixed
food
to
avoid
parasitic
diseases
meat
should
not
be
eaten
rare
especially
pork
the
amount
of
drink
taken
should
not
be
more
than
three
pints
in
hours
the
excessive
use
of
tea
and
coffee
should
be
avoided
pickles
boiled
cabbage
and
other
indigestible
articles
should
never
be
eaten
to
avoid
the
evil
effects
of
alcoholic
liquors
perfect
abstinence
is
the
only
safe
course
to
pursue
although
one
may
use
spirituous
liquors
in
moderation
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
possibly
remain
healthy
yet
such
an
indulgence
is
unnecessary
and
exceedingly
dangerous
a
person
who
abstains
entirely
from
their
use
is
safe
from
their
pernicious
influence
a
person
who
indulges
ever
so
moderately
is
in
danger
a
person
who
relies
on
such
stimulants
for
support
in
the
hour
of
need
is
lost
while
the
use
of
tobacco
is
less
pernicious
than
alcohol
in
its
effects
et
it
exerts
a
profound
disturbing
influence
upon
the
nervous
system
and
gives
rise
to
various
functional
and
organic
diseases
this
is
the
verdict
of
those
who
have
given
the
subject
the
most
study
and
who
have
had
the
best
opportunities
for
extensive
observation
suddenly
fatal
results
have
followed
excesses
in
the
use
of
tobacco
therefore
the
habit
should
be
avoided
or
if
already
acquired
it
should
be
immediately
abandoned
the
clothing
should
be
light
and
porous
adapted
in
warmth
to
the
season
it
is
especially
important
that
persons
in
advanced
life
should
be
well
protected
against
vicissitudes
of
heat
and
cold
exposure
is
the
cause
of
almost
all
those
inflammatory
diseases
which
occur
during
winter
and
take
off
the
feeble

the
aged
the

be
kept
scrupulously
clean
by

corsets

which
impede
the
flow
of
blood
compress
the
organs
of
the
chest
or
abdomen
or
restrict
the
movements
of
the
body
are
very
injurious
and
should
not
be
worn
articles

irritating
should
be
carefully
avoided
it
matters
not
how
varied
a

it

an
error
to
suppose
that

than
this

conducive

if
not
carried

the

to
sleep
is
eight

out
of

as
a
rule
those

this
amount

the
most
favorable
time
for

is
between

all
excitement
the
use

be
secured

that

and
increases
its

the

a
powerful
influence
over
the
physical

it
is
important
therefore
that
they

faculties
this
rule
applies
equally
to

to

i
the
progress
of
medicine
during
the
last
half
century
a
great
change
has
taken
place
in
the
treatment
of
disease
medicine
has
advanced
with
rapid
strides
from
the
narrow
limits
of
mere
empiricism
to
the
broader
realm
of
rationalism
until
to
day
it
comprehends
all
the
elements
of
an
art
and
a
science
scientific
researches
and
investigations
have
added
many
valuable
truths
to
the
general
fund
of
medical
learning
but
much
more
has
been
effected
by
observation
and
empirical
discovery
it
is
of
little
or
no
interest
to
the
invalid
to
know
whether
the
prescribed
remedy
is
organic
or
inorganic
simple
compound
or
complex
in
his
anxiety
and
distress
of
body
he
seeks
solely
for
relief
without
regard
to
the
character
of
the
remedial
agents
employed
but
this
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
patient
does
not
obviate
the
necessity
for
a
thorough
scientific
education
on
the
part
of
the
practitioner
notwithstanding
all
the
laws
enacted
to
raise
the
standard
of
medicine
and
thus
protect
the
public
from
quackery
there
yet
exists
a
disposition
among
many
to
cling
to
all
that
savors
of
the
miraculous
or
supernatural
to
insure
the
future
advancement
of
the
healing
art
physicians
must
instruct
mankind
in
physiology
hygiene
and
medicine
when
the
people
understand
the
nature
of
diseases
their
causes
methods
of
prevention
and
cure
they
will
not
be
easily
deceived
and
practitioners
will
be
obliged
to
qualify
themselves
better
for
their
labors
the
practice
of
medicine
is
every
year
becoming
more
successful
new
and
improved
methods
of
treating
disease
are
being
discovered
and
developed
and
the
conscientious
physician
will
avail
himself
of
the
means
by
a
knowledge
of
which
he
may
benefit
his
the
medical
profession
is
divided
into
three
principal
schools
or
sects
the
allopathic
regular
or
old
school
of
medicine
this
is
the
oldest
existing
branch
of
the
profession
to
it
is
due
the
credit
of
collecting
and
arranging
the
facts
and
discoveries
which
form
the
foundation
of
the
healing
art
it
has
done
and
is
doing
much
to
place
the
science
of
medicine
on
a
firm
basis
to
the
of
this
school
every
student
who
would
qualify
himself
for
medical
practice
must
resort
to
gain
that
knowledge
upon
which
depends
his
future
success
the
early
practice
of
this
branch
of
the
profession
was
necessarily
crude
and
empirical
conservative
in
its
character
it
has
ever
been
slow
to
recognize
new
theories
and
methods
of
practice
and
has
failed
to
adopt
them
until
they
have
been
incontrovertibly
established
this
conservatism
was
manifested
in
the
opposition
to
harvey
when
he
propounded
the
theory
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
to
jenner
when
he
discovered
and
demonstrated
the
beneficial
effects
of
vaccination
thus
has
it
ever
defended
its
established
opinions
against
innovation
yet
out
of
this
very
conservatism
has
grown
much
real
good
for
although
it
has
wasted
no
time
or
energy
in
the
investigation
of
theories
yet
it
has
accepted
them
when
established
in
this
manner
it
has
added
to
its
fund
of
knowledge
only
those
truths
which
are
of
real
and
intrinsic
value
the
history
of
medicine
may
be
divided
into
three
eras
in
the
first
the
practice
of
medicine
was
merely
empiricism
ignorant
priests
or
astrologers
administered
drugs
concerning
the
properties
of
which
they
had
no
knowledge
to
appease
the
wrath
of
mythological
deities
in
the
second
or
heroic
era
the
lancet
mercury
antimony
opium
and
the
blister
were
employed
indiscriminately
as
the
qua
of
medical
practice
the
present
with
all
its
scientific
knowledge
of
the
human
structure
and
functions
and
its
vast
resources
for
remedying
disease
may
be
aptly
termed
the
liberal
era
of
medicine
the
allopathic
differs
from
the
other
schools
mainly
in
the
application
of
remedies
in
its
ranks
are
found
men
indefatigable
in
their
labors
delving
deep
into
the
mysteries
of
nature
and
who
for
their
scientific
attainments
and
humane
principles
are
justly
considered
ornaments
to
society
and
to
their
profession
homoeopathy
although
this
school
is
of
comparatively
recent
origin
yet
it
has
gained
a
powerful
hold
upon
the
public
favor
and
numbers
among
its
patrons
very
many
intelligent
citizens
this
fact
alone
would
seem
to
indicate
that
it
possesses
some
merit
the
homeopathic
differs
from
the
allopathic
school
principally
in
its
law
of
cure
which
according
to
hahnemann
its
founder
was
the
doctrine
of
similia
similibus
curantur
or
like
cures
like
its
method
of
treatment
is
founded
upon
the
assumption
that
if
a
drug
be
given
to
a
healthy
person
symptoms
will
occur
which
if
transpiring
in
disease
would
be
mitigated
by
the
same
drug
while
it
may
be
exceedingly
difficult
for
a
member
of
another
school
to
accept
this
doctrine
and
comprehend
the
method
founded
upon
it
yet
no
one
can
deny
that
it
contains
some
elements
of
truth
imbued
with
the
spirit
of
progress
many
of
its
most
intelligent
and
successful
practitioners
have
resorted
to
the
use
of
appreciable
quantities
of
medicine
this
school
associates
hydropathy
with
its
practice
and
usually
inculcates
rigid
dietetic
and
hygienic
regulations
many
homoeopathic
remedies
are
thoroughly
triturated
with
sugar
of
milk
which
renders
them
more
palatable
and
efficacious
whether
we
attribute
their
cures
to
the
infinitesimal
doses
which
many
homoeopathists
employ
to
their
law
of
cure
to
good
nursing
or
to
the
power
of
nature
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
their
practice
is
measurably
successful
no
doubt
the
homoeopathic
practice
has
modified
that
of
the
other
schools
by
proving
that
diseases
may
be
alleviated
by
smaller
quantities
of

eclectic
school
this
school
founded
by
wooster
beach
instituted
the
most
strenuous
opposition
to
the
employment
of
mercury
antimony
the
blister
and
the
lancet
the
members
of
this
new
school
proclaimed
that
the
action
of
heroic
and
noxious
medicines
was
opposed
to
the
operation
of
the
vital
forces
and
proposed
to
substitute
in
their
place
safer
and
more
efficacious
agents
derived
exclusively
from
the
vegetable
kingdom
the
eclectics
have
investigated
the
properties
of
indigenous
plants
and
have
discovered
many
valuable
remedies
which
a
kind
and
bounteous
nature
has
so
generously
supplied
for
the
healing
of
her
children
marked

attended
the
employment
of
these
agents
in
a
committee
on
indigenous
medical
botany
appointed
by
the
american
medical
association
acknowledged
that
the
practitioners
of
the
regular
school
had
been
extremely
ignorant
of
the
medical
virtues
of
plants
even
of
those
of
their
own
neighborhoods
the
employment
of
podophyllin
and
leptandrin
as
substitutes
for
mercurials
has
been
so
successful
that
they
are
now
used
by
practitioners
of
all
schools
although
claiming
to
have
been
founded
upon
liberal
principles
it
may
be
questioned
whether
its
adherents
have
not
been
quite
as
exclusive
and
dogmatic
as
those
whom
they
have
opposed
it
can
not
be
denied
however
that
the
eclectics
have
added
many
important
remedies
to
the
materia
medica
their
writings
are
important
and
useful
contributions
to
the
physician
library
the
liberal
and
independent
physician
after
this
brief
review
of
the
various
medical
sects
the
reader
may
be
curious
to
learn
to
what
sect
the
physicians
of
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
belong
among
them
are
to
be
found
graduates
from
the
colleges
of
all
the
different
schools
they
are
not
restricted
by
the
tenets
of
any
one
sect
but
claim
the
right
and
privilege
nay
consider
it
a
duty
to
select
from
all
such
remedies
as
careful
investigation
scientific
research
and
an
extensive
experience
have
proved
valuable
they
resort
to
any
and
every
agent
which
has
been
proved
efficacious
whether
it
be
vegetable
or
mineral
and
here
arises
a
distinction
between
remedial
agents
and
those
which
are
many
practitioners
deplore
the
use
of
poisons
and
advocate
innocuous
medicines
which
produce
only
curative
results
we
agree
with
them
in
one
proposition
namely
that
improper
medicines
not
only
poison
but
frequently
utterly
destroy
the
health
and
body
of
the
patient
every
physician
should
keep
steadily
in
view
the
final
effects
as
well
as
present
relief
and
never
employ
any
agent
without
regard
to
its
ulterior
consequences
however
an
agent
which
is
noxious
in
may
prove
a
valuable
remedy
in
when
morbid
changes
have
taken
place
in
the
blood
and
tissues
when
a
general
diseased
condition
of
the
bodily
organs
has
occurred
then
an
agent
which
is
poisonous
in
health
may
prove
curative
for
instance
it
is
admitted
that
alcohol
is
a
poison
that
it
prevents
healthful
assimilation
solidifies
pepsin
begets
a
morbid
appetite
that
it
produces
intoxication
and
that
its
habitual
use
destroys
the
body
it
is
therefore
neither
a
hygienic
nor
a
sanative
agent
but
strictly
a
noxious
one
yet
its
very
distinct
antiseptic
properties
render
it
valuable
for
remedial
purposes
since
these
qualities
promptly
arrest
that
fatal
form
of
decomposition
of
the
animal
fluids
which
is
occasioned
by
which
produces
its
deadly
effects
in
the
same
manner
as
a
drop
of
yeast
ferments
the
largest
mash
alcohol
checks
this
poisonous
and
deadly
process
and
neutralizes
its
effects
thus
alcohol
although
a
noxious
agent
possesses
a
special
curative
influence
in
a
morbid
state
of
the
human
system
but
its
general
remedial
effects
do
not
entitle
it
to
the
rank
of
a
hygienic
agent
we
believe
that
medicine
is
undergoing
a
gradual
change
from
the
darkness
of
the
past
with
its
ignorance
superstition
and
barbarism
to
the
light
of
a
glorious
future
at
each
successive
step
in
the
path
of
progress
medicine
approaches
one
degree
nearer
the
realm
of
an
exact
science
the
common
object
of
the
practitioners
of
all
medical
schools
is
the
alleviation
of
human
suffering
the
only
difference
between
the
schools
is
in
the
remedies
employed
the
size
of
dose
administered
and
the
results
attained
these
are
insufficient
grounds
for
bitter
sectarianism
we
are
all
fellow
laborers
in
the
same
field
before
us
lies
a
boundless
expanse
for
exploration
there
are
new
conditions
of
disease
to
be
learned
new
remedies
to
be
discovered
and
new
properties
of
old
ones
to
be
examined
we
do
not
deplore
the
fact
that
there
are
different
schools
in
medicine
for
this
science
has
not
reached
perfection
and
they
tend
to
stimulate
investigation
the
remarks
of
herbert
spencer
on
the
multiplication
of
schemes
of
juvenile
culture
may
be
pertinently
applied
to
the
different
schools
in
medicine
with
increased
force
he
says
it
is
clear
that
dissent
in
education
results
in
facilitating
inquiry
by
the
division
in
labor
were
we
in
possession
of
the
true
method
divergence
from
it
would
of
course
be
prejudicial
but
the
true
method
having
to
be
found
the
efforts
of
numerous
independent
seekers
carrying
out
their
researches
in
different
directions
constitute
a
better
agency
for
finding
it
than
any
that
could
be
devised
each
of
them
struck
by
some
new
thought
which
probably
contains
more
or
less
of
basis
in
facts
each
of
them
zealous
on
behalf
of
his
plan
fertile
in
expedients
to
test
its
correctness
and
untiring
in
its
efforts
to
make
known
its
success
each
of
them
merciless
in
its
criticism
on
the
rest
there
can
not
fail
by
composition
of
forces
to
be
a
gradual
approximation
of
all
towards
the
right
course
whatever
portion
of
the
normal
method
any
one
of
them
has
discovered
must
by
the
constant
exhibition
of
its
results
force
itself
into
adoption
whatever
wrong
practices
he
has
joined
with
it
must
by
repeated
experiment
and
failure
be
exploded
and
by
this
aggregation
of
truths
and
elimination
of
errors
there
must
eventually
be
developed
a
correct
and
complete
body
of
doctrine
of
the
three
phases
through
which
human
opinion
passes
the
unanimity
of
the
ignorant
the
disagreement
of
the
inquiring
and
the
unanimity
of
the
wise
it
is
manifest
that
the
second
is
the
parent
of
the
third
we
believe
the
time
is
coming
when
those
maladies
which
are
now
considered
fatal
will
be
readily
cured
when
disease
will
be
disarmed
of
its
terrors
to
be
successful
a
physician
must
be
independent
free
from
all
bigotry
having
no
narrow
prejudice
against
his
liberal
accepting
new
truths
from
whatever
source
they
come

chapter
ii
remedies
for
disease
it
will
be
our
aim
throughout
this
book
to
prescribe
such
remedies
as
are
within
the
easy
reach
of
all
and
which
may
be
safely
employed
many
of
those
of
the
vegetable
class
are
indigenous
to
this
country
and
may
be
procured
in
their
strength
and
purity
at
the
proper
season
by
those
residing
in
the
localities
where
they
grow
while
all
others
advised
may
be
obtained
at
any
good
we
shall
endeavor
to
recommend
such
as
can
be
procured
and
prepared
with
the
least
trouble
and
expense
to
the
patient
when
it
is
believed
that
they
will
be
equally
as
efficacious
as
more
expensive
medicines
proprietary
medicines
having
the
invalid
best
interests
in
view
it
will
often
happen
that
we
can
not
prescribe
better
or
cheaper
remedies
nor
those
which
are
more
effective
or
easily
obtained
than
some
of
our
standard
preparations
which
are
sold
by
all
druggists
we
are
aware
that
there
is
a
popular
and
not
altogether
unfounded
prejudice
against
patent
medicines
owing
to
the
small
amount
of
merit
which
many
of
them
possess
the
term
patent
medicine
does
not
apply
to
pierce
remedies
as
no
patent
has
ever
been
asked
or
obtained
for
them
nor
have
they
been
urged
upon
the
public
as
cure
alls
they
are
simply
favorite
prescriptions
which
in
a
very
extensive
practice
have
proved
their
superior
remedial
virtues
in
the
cure
of
the
diseases
for
which
they
are
recommended
from
the
time
of
hippocrates
down
to
the
present
day
physicians
have
classified
diseases
according
to
their
causes
character
or
symptoms
it
has
been
proved
that
diseases
apparently
different
may
often
be
cured
by
the
same
remedy
the
reason
for
this
singular
fact
is
obvious
a
single
remedy
may
possess
a
variety
of
properties
quinine
among
other
properties
has
a
tonic
which
suggests
its
use
in
cases
of
debility
an
antiperiodic
which
renders
it
efficient
in
ague
and
an
property
which
renders
it
efficacious
in
cases
of
fever
the
result
produced
varies
with
the
quantity
given
the
time
of
its
administration
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
is
employed
every
practicing
physician
has
his
favorite
remedies
which
he
oftenest
recommends
or
uses
because
he
has
the
greatest
confidence
in
their
virtues
the
patient
does
not
know
their
composition
even
prescriptions
are
usually
written
in
a
language
unintelligible
to
anybody
but
the
druggist
as
much
secrecy
is
employed
as
in
the
preparation
of
proprietary
medicines
does
the
fact
that
an
article
is
prepared
by
a
process
known
only
to
the
manufacturer
render
that
article
less
valuable
how
many
physicians
know
the
elementary
composition
of
the
remedies
which
they
employ
some
of
which
never
have
been
analyzed
few
practitioners
know
how
morphine
quinine
podophyllin
leptandrin
pepsin
or
chloroform
are
made
or
how
nauseous
drugs
are
transformed
into
palatable
elixirs
yet
they
do
not
hesitate
to
employ
them
is
it
not
inconsistent
to
use
a
prescription
the
composition
of
which
is
unknown
to
us
and
discard
another
preparation
simply
because
it
is
accompanied
by
a
printed
statement
of
its
properties
with
directions
for
its
use
various
journals
in
this
country
have
at
different
times
published
absurd
formulae
purporting
to
be
receipts
for
the
preparation
of
sage
catarrh
remedy
and
pierce
standard
medicines
which
in
most
instances
have
not
contained
a
single
ingredient
which
enters
into
the
composition
of
these
celebrated
remedies
in
the
manufacture
of
any
pharmaceutical
preparation
two
conditions
are
essential
to
its
perfection
viz
purity
and
strength
of
the
materials
and
appropriate
machinery
the
first
is
insured
by
purchasing
the
materials
in
large
quantities
whereby
the
exercise
of
greater
care
in
selecting
the
ingredients
can
be
afforded
and
the
second
can
only
be
accomplished
where
the
business
is
extensive
enough
to
warrant
a
large
outlay
of
capital
in
procuring
proper
chemical
apparatus
these
facts
apply
with
especial
force
to
the
manufacture
of
our
medicines
their
quality
having
been
vastly
improved
since
the
demand
has
become
so
great
as
to
require
their
manufacture
in
very
large
quantities
some
persons
while
admitting
that
our
medicines
are
good
pharmaceutical
compounds
object
to
them
on
the
ground
that
they
are
too
often
used
with
insufficient
judgment
we
propose
to
obviate
that
difficulty
by
enlightening
the
people
as
to
the
structure
and
functions
of
their
bodies
the
causes
character
and
symptoms
of
disease
and
by
indicating
the
proper
and
judicious
employment
of
our
medicines
together
with
such
auxiliary
treatment
as
may
be
necessary
such
is
one
of
the
designs
of
this
volume
properties
of
medicine
it
is
generally
conceded
that
the
action
of
a
remedy
upon
the
human
system
depends
upon
properties
peculiar
to
it
the
effects
produced
suggest
the
naming
of
these
qualities
which
have
been
scientifically
classified
we
shall
name
the
diseases
from
their
characteristic
symptoms
and
then
without
commenting
upon
all
the
properties
of
a
remedy
recommend
its
employment
our
reference
to
the
qualities
of
any
remedy
when
we
do
make
a
particular
allusion
to
them
we
shall
endeavor
to
make
as
easy
and
familiar
as
possible
dose
all
persons
are
not
equally
susceptible
to
the
influence
of
medicines
as
a
rule
women
require
smaller
doses
than
men
and
children
less
than
women
infants
are
very
susceptible
to
the
effects
of
anodynes
even
out
of
all
relative
proportion
to
other
kinds
of
medicines
the
circumstances
and
conditions
of
the
system
increase
or
diminish
the
effects
of
medicine
so
that
an
aperient
at
one
time
may
act
as
a
cathartic
at
another
and
a
dose
that
will
simply
prove
to
be
an
anodyne
when
the
patient
is
suffering
great
pain
will
act
as
a
narcotic
when
he
is
not
this
explains
why
the
same
dose
often
affects
individuals
differently
the
following
table
is
given
to
indicate
the
size
of
the
dose
and
is
graduated
to
the
age
years
dose
to
the
doses
mentioned
in
the
following
pages
are
those
for
adults
except
when
otherwise
specified
the
preparation
of
medicines
the
remedies
which
we
shall
mention
for
domestic
use
are
mostly
vegetable
infusions
and
decoctions
of
these
will
often
be
advised
on
account
of
the
fact
that
they
are
more
available
than
the
tinctures
fluid
extracts
and
concentrated
principles
which
we
prefer
and
almost
invariably
employ
in
our
practice
most
of
these
medical
extracts
are
prepared
in
our
chemical
laboratory
under
the
supervision
of
a
careful
and
skilled
pharmaceutist
no
one
we
presume
would
expect
with
only
a
dish
of
hot
water
and
a
to
equal
in
pharmaceutical
skill
the
learned
chemist
with
all
his
ingeniously
devised
and
costly
apparatus
for
extracting
the
active
remedial
principles
from
medicinal
plants
yet
infusions
and
decoctions
are
not
without
their
value
and
from
the
inferior
quality
of
many
of
the
fluid
extracts
and
other
pharmaceutical
preparations
in
the
market
it
may
be
questioned
whether
the
former
are
not
frequently
as
valuable
as
the
latter
so
unreliable
are
a
majority
of
the
fluid
extracts
tinctures
and
concentrated
active
principles
found
in
the
that
we
long
since
found
it
necessary
to
have
prepared
in
our
laboratory
most
of
those
which
we
employ
to
the
reliability
of
the
preparations
which
we
secure
in
this
way
we
largely
attribute
our
great
success
in
the
treatment
of
disease
tinctures
and
fluid
extracts
are
often
prepared
from
old
and
worthless
roots
barks
and
herbs
which
have
wholly
lost
their
medicinal
properties
yet
they
are
sold
at
just
as
high
prices
as
those
which
are
good
we
manufacture
our
tinctures
fluid
extracts
and
concentrated
active
principles
from
roots
barks
and
herbs
which
are
fresh
and
selected
with
the
greatest
care
many
of
the
crude
roots
barks
and
herbs
found
in
the
market
are
inactive
because
they
have
been
gathered
at
the
wrong
season
these
together
with
those
that
have
been
kept
on
hand
so
long
as
to
have
lost
all
medicinal
value
are
often
sold
in
large
quantities
and
at
reduced
prices
to
be
manufactured
into
fluid
extracts
and
tinctures
of
course
the
preparations
made
from
such
materials
are
worthless
whenever
the
dose
of
fluid
extracts
tinctures
and
concentrated
active
principles
is
mentioned
in
this
chapter
the
quantity
advised
is
based
upon
our
experience
in
the
use
of
these
preparations
as
they
are
made
in
our
laboratory
and
the
smallest
quantity
which
will
produce
the
desired
effect
is
always
given
when
using
most
of
the
preparations
found
in
the
the
doses
have
to
be
somewhat
increased
and
even
then
they
will
not
always
produce
the
desired
effect
for
reasons
already
given
the
list
of
medicines
which
we
shall
introduce
in
this
chapter
will
be
quite
limited
as
we
can
not
hope
by
making
it
extensive
that
the
reader
would
be
able
to
prescribe
with
good
judgment
any
other
than
the
simpler
remedies
hence
we
prefer
since
we
have
not
space
in
this
volume
to
waste
to
mention
only
a
few
of
the
most
common
remedies
under
each
head
or
classification
tinctures
very
uniform
and
reliable
tinctures
may
be
made
of
most
indigenous
plants
by
procuring
the
part
to
be
employed
at
the
proper
season
while
it
is
green
and
fresh
bruising
it
well
and
covering
it
with
good
strong
whiskey
or
with
alcohol
diluted
with
one
part
of
water
to
three
of
alcohol
corking
tightly
and
letting
it
stand
about
fourteen
days
when
the
tincture
may
be
filtered
or
poured
off
from
the
drugs
and
will
be
ready
for
use
prepared
in
this
imperfect
manner
they
rill
be
found
to
be
much
more
reliable
than
any
of
the
fluid
extracts
found
in
the
an
excess
of
the
crude
drug
should
be
used
in
preparing
the
tincture
to
insure
a
perfect
saturation
of
the

these
are
generally
made
by
adding

the
difference
between
a
decoction
and
an
infusion
is
that
the
plant

substance
is
boiled

of
the
former
in

to
obtain
its
soluble
medicinal
qualities
cover
the
vessel
containing
the
ingredients
thus
confining
the
vapor
and
shutting
out
the
atmospheric
air
which
sometimes
impairs
the
active
principles
and
their
medicinal
qualities
the
ordinary
mode
of
preparing
a
decoction
is
to
use
one
ounce
of
the
plant
root

flower
or
substance
to
a
pint
of
water
the
dose
internally
varies
from
a

alteratives

which
in

manner
gradually
change

they
stimulate

which
ought
to

they
facilitate

of

tone

we
prefer

in

none
of
the

at

in
perfecting

we
have

is
required
to
cleanse

its
nutrition

establish
a
healthy

increase
the
peristaltic
movement
of

nutritive
processes
while
aiding
in
evacuating
the

all
this
they
accomplish
without
corroding
the

genial
helping
the

generally
preferable
for

on
account
of
its
unirritating
character
and
the
smallness

effect
than
one
who
is
a
chronic

an

accustomed
to
the
use
of

requires
a
much
larger

to
procure
relief
than
one
who

be
repeated
until
their

persons
subject

of
these
troubles
should
never
be
without
a
vial
of
the
pleasant
pellets
at
hand
in
proof
of
their
superior
excellence
it
can
be
truthfully
said
that
they
are
always
adopted
as
a
household
remedy
after
the
first
trial
the
pleasant
pellets
are
far
more
effective
in
arousing
the
liver
to
action
than
blue
pills
the
compound
cathartic
pills
calomel
or
other
mercurial
preparations
and
have
the
further
merit
of
being
purely
vegetable
in
their
composition
and
perfectly
harmless
in
any
condition
of
the
system
furthermore
no
particular
care
is
required
while
using
them
being
composed
of
the
choicest
concentrated
vegetable
extracts
their
cost
of
production
is
much
more
than
that
of
most
pills
found
in
the
market
yet
from
forty
to
of
them
are
put
up
in
each
glass
vial
as
sold
through
druggists
and
can
be
had
at
the
price
of
the
more
ordinary
and
cheaper
made
pills
once
used
they
are
always
in
favor
their
secondary
effect
is
to
keep
the
bowels
open
and
regular
not
to
further
constipate
as
is
the
case
with
other
pills
hence
their
great
popularity
with
sufferers
from
habitual
constipation
piles
and
their
attendant
discomfort
and
manifold
derangements
for
all
laxative
and
cathartic
purposes
the
pleasant
pellets
are
infinitely
superior
to
all
mineral
waters
sediltz
powders
salts
castor
oil
fruit
syrups
laxative
teas
and
the
many
other
purgative
compounds
sold
in
various
forms
if
people
generally
would
pay
more
attention
to
properly
regulating
the
action
of
their
bowels
they
would
have
less
frequent
occasion
to
call
for
their
doctor
services
to
subdue
attacks
of
dangerous
diseases
hence
it
is
of
great
importance
to
know
what
safe
harmless
agent
best
serves
the
purpose
of
producing
the
desired
action
directions
for
using
pierce
pleasant
pellets
in
all
cases
the
size
of
dose
to
be
taken
must
be
regulated
somewhat
by
the
known
susceptibility
of
the
individual
to
the
action
of
laxative
and
cathartic
medicines
some
persons
bowels
are
readily
acted
upon
by
small
doses
while
others
require
more
as
a
general
rule
the
smaller
doses
which
we
recommend
are
quite
sufficient
and
produce
the
best
results
if
persisted
in
for
a
reasonable
length
of
time
for
a
gentle
aperient
or
laxative
take
one
or
not
more
than
two
and
preferably
in
the
morning
on
an
empty

generally
sufficient

taken
in

be

of
two

will
be
sufficient
for
a

a
child
of
four
to
eight
years
one

act
nicely
if
given

as
soon
as

in
all
chronic
diseases
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
the
bowels
be
kept
yet
thorough
purgation
should
be
avoided
as
it
tends
to
debilitate
the
system
small
laxative
doses
of
one
or
at
most
two
pellets
taken
daily
and
continued
for
a
long
time
is
the
plan
that
we
would
recommend
to
produce
the
best
results
in
dropsy
an
occasional
active
cathartic
dose
of
the
pellets
of
say
to
taken
once
in
a
week
or
ten
days
will
do
good
if
in

and
it
is
only
in
these
sudden
and
severe
attacks
of
diseases
that
we
recommend
the
pellets
to
be
taken
in
active
purgative
doses
and
in
these
cases
large

of

baths
and
motion
as
remedial
agents
the
remedial
effects
of
bathing
are
generally
underrated
this
want
of
appreciation
is
more
often
due
to
the
improper
manner
in
which
it
is
performed
than
to
an
insufficiency
of
curative
virtues
the
term
not
only
implies
a
cleaning
of
the
body
or
certain
portions
of
it
but
also
the
application
of
water
in
such
a
manner
as
to
influence
the
nervous
system
and
regulate
the
functions
of
the
secretory
organs
cleanliness
while
it
preserves
health
and
promotes
recovery
has
reference
only
to
the
hygienic
influences
of
water
and
not
to
its
curative
effects
there
are
several
kinds
of
baths
the

the

if
the

too

two

the

and
its

injurious
while
it

highly
invigorating
to

persons
those
who
have
a
low
standard
of
vitality
should
be
cautions
in
its
employment
a
local
bath
may
be
followed
by
beneficial
results
when
a
general
bath
would
be
inadmissible
for
these
reasons
we
advise
the
general
use
of
the
cool
bath
at
a
temperature
of
from
to
fahr
if
in
any
instance
the
is
we
recommend
the
temperate
bath
at
a
temperature
of
from
to
fahr
the
time
of
remaining
in
the
bath
should
be
regulated
by
the
strength
of
the
invalid
as
a
rule
it
should
not
exceed
three
and
the
colder
the
water
the
less
time
should
the
patient
be
immersed
immediately
after
emerging
from
any
bath
the
body
should
be
thoroughly
dried
and
rubbed
with
a
moderately
coarse
towel
until
a
glow
is
experienced
and
reaction
is
fully
established
the
attempt
to
toughen
children
by
exposing
them
to
low
temperatures
of
either
air
or
water
can
not
be
too
emphatically
condemned
this
caution
however
does
not
apply
to
the
employment
of
moderately
cool
water
for
ablutions
the
cold
or
cool
bath
should
be
taken
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
but
during
whenever
reaction
does
not
follow
bathing
artificial
means
must
be
resorted
to
as
stimulating

the
tepid
bath
the
temperature
of

generally
used
for
cleansing
the
body
it
is
prescribed
in
fevers
and
inflammatory
affections
for
its
cooling
effects
it
is
usually
medicated
with
some
acid
or
alkali
the
latter
unites
with
the
oily
secretion
of
the
skin
and
forms
a
soapy
compound
easily
removed
by
the
water
the
temperature
should
be
regulated
according
to
the
vitality
of
the
patient
and
the
bath
may
be
repeated
two
or
three
times
a
day
it
removes
superfluous
heat
and
keeps
the
skin
in
a
condition
favorable
for

the
warm

at
a
temperature
varying
from

always
agreeable
and
refreshing
it
equalizes
the
circulation
and
softens
the
skin
by
removing
all
impurities
it
moderates
pain
and
soothes
the
whole

it
does
not
weaken

debilitate
the

is
in

it

remedial
agent
in
many
chronic
diseases

it
should
be
employed
immediately

unless
urgent
symptoms
demand
it
at
other
times
it
may
be
medicated
or
not
as
circumstances
require
but
should
always
be
taken
in
a
warm
room
the
hot
bath
at
a
temperature
of
from
to
fahr
is
a
powerful
stimulant
it
excites
the
nerves
and
through
them
the
entire
system
it
causes
a
sense
of
heat
and
a
constriction
of
the
secretory
organs
but
perspiration
languor
and
torpor
soon
follow
in
the
sudden
retrocession
of
cutaneous
diseases
it
restores

the
hot

be
astonished
at
the
amount

the

has
been
constantly
growing
in

its
value
is
now
recognized
by
all
physicians
throughout

the
judicious
use

erasmus
wilson
of
england
says
in
a
paper
read
before
the
london
medical
association
the
inhabitant
of
a
large
city
would
live
as
healthy
immured
within
city
walls
as
amid
the
fields
and
meadows
of
the
country
his
bath
would
be
to
him
in
the
place
of
a
country
house
or
horse
it
would
give
him
air
exercise
freshness
health
and
life
the
bath
that
cleanses
the
inward
as
well
as
the
outward
man
that
is
applicable
to
every
age
that
is
adapted
to
make
health
healthier
and
alleviate
disease
whatever
its
stage
or
severity
deserves
to
be
adopted
as
a
national
institution
and
merits
the
advocacy
of
all
medical
men
of
those
whose
especial
duty
it
is
to
teach
how
health
may
be
preserved
and
how
disease
may
be
averted
the
hot
atmosphere
of
the
turkish
bath
promotes
rapid
evaporation
from
the
surface
of
the
body
and
it
is
well
known
that
rapid
evaporation
from
the
surface
is
a
cooling
process
a
person
finger
may
be
frozen
in
one
minute
time
by
throwing
upon
it
a
constant
fine
spray
of
rhigolene
or
sulphuric
ether
the
rapid
evaporation
of
the
light
fluid
congeals
the
liquids
of
the
tissues
and
a
film
of
ice
is
rapidly
formed
upon
the
part
in
a
less
intense
degree
the
same
cooling
process
is
carried
on
over
the
whole
surface
of
a
person
when
in
the
hot
room
or
of
the
turkish
bath
the
evaporation
from
the
surface
is
so
rapid
that
one
can
hardly
appreciate
the
profuseness
of
the
perspiration
going
on
the
evaporation
from
the
surface
so
rapidly
carries
off
the
heat
from
the
body
that
one
finds
himself
able
with
little
or
no
inconvenience
to
remain
in
a
room
heated
to
from
to
or
even
fahr
as
a
hygienic
measure
to
be
regularly
or
occasionally
employed
by
persons
in
fair
health
the
turkish
or
hot
bath
is
far
superior
to
the
russian
or
it
produces
more
profuse
perspiration
and
is
therefore
more
depurating
or
cleansing
in
its
effects
it
does
not
relax
the
system
but
rather
produces
a
tonic
effect
and
fewer
precautions
are
therefore
necessary
to
guard
against
taking
cold
after
employing
it
the
turkish
bath
can
be
better
ventilated
than
the
russian
while
the
air
is

it
that
the

patient
perspires
freely
which
in
a
majority
of
cases
will
be
in
five
or
ten
minutes
if
during
the
operation
the
patient
feels
faint
or
thirsty
cold
water
must
be
sprinkled
or
dashed
in
his
face
or
he
may
drink
one
or
two
swallows
of
it
and
in
some
cases
the
head
may
be
bathed
with
cold
water
as
soon
as
free
perspiration
is
produced
wrap
the
blankets
around
him
place
him
in
bed
and
cover
him
up
warm
giving
him
about
a
pint
of
either
some
good
store
tea
ginger
or
some
diaphoretic
herb
tea
to
drink
as
warm
as
he
can
take
it
after
two
or
three
hours
remove
the
covering
piece
by
piece
at
intervals
of
twenty
or
minutes
each
that
he
may
gradually
cease
perspiring
the
above
method
may
be
improved
by
using
an
ordinary
hoop
skirt
ten
to
twelve
inches
below
the
bottom
of
which
is
suspended
a
larger
and
stronger
hoop
the
upper
and
smaller
hoops
should
rest
upon
the
patient
shoulders
a
woolen
blanket
large
enough
to
reach
and
rest
upon
the
floor
and
envelop
the
whole
person
is
thrown
over
the
hoops
unless
the
bath
is
employed
to
diminish
the
quantity
of
fluids
in
the
body
as
in
dropsy
the
patient
may
drink
some
simple
diaphoretic
infusion
to
hasten
or
facilitate
perspiration
when
he
perspires
freely
small
quantities
of
cold
water
may
be
frequently
given
there
is
little
or
no
danger
of
taking
cold
after
this
process
if
ordinary
precaution
is
observed
and
it
is
easy
agreeable
safe
and
effectual
occasionally
we
will
meet
with
patients
upon
whom
it
is
almost
impossible
to
produce
the
slightest
moisture
much
less
perspiration
the
skin
of
such
persons
is
generally
dry
and
harsh
communicating
an
unpleasant
sensation
to
the
touch
in
most
instances
the
skin
may
be
restored
to
its
normal
condition
by
adopting
the
following
course
anoint
the
whole
surface
of
the
body
and
limbs
with
olive
oil
every
night
upon
retiring
to
bed
every
morning
wash
the
whole
surface
with
a
warm
weak
alkaline
solution
employing
considerable
friction
while
drying
every
two
weeks
administer
a
spirit
a
perseverance
in
this
course
for
a
few
months
will
accomplish
the
desired
result
frequent
reference
to
spirit
will
be
made
by
the
author
of
this
work
in
speaking
of
those
diseases
in
which
its
employment
will
prove
beneficial
sea
bathing
is
an
excellent
remedial
agent
in
chronic
disorders
particularly
in
those
of
an
atonic
character
such
as
nervous
prostration
dyspepsia
and
general
debility
much
of
the
benefit
attributed
to
this
mode
of
bathing
is
undoubtedly
due
to
other
influences
such
as
pure
air
exercise
change
of
scenery
diet
and
associations
which
surround
the
patient
during
his
sojourn
at
the
at
first
the
duration
of
a
should
not
exceed
three
or
five
minutes
but
it
may
be
gradually
prolonged
to
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
if
the
patient
is
very
feeble
one
or
two
baths
a
week
are
sufficient
and
the
most
robust
person
should
never
take
more
than
one
a
day
they
should
always
be
taken
in
the
earlier
portion
of
the
day
before
breakfast
if
possible
and
during
before
entering
this
bath
a
moderate
degree
of
exercise
should
always
be
taken
enough
to
arouse
the
vital
energies
but
not
to
produce
fatigue
suitably
dressed
the
patient
plunges
into
the
water
in
which
he
remains
during
the
prescribed
time
immediately
after
emerging
from
the
bath
the
patient
should
be
thoroughly
dried
and
dressed
and
then
moderate
exercise
should
be
taken
to
induce
reaction
if
the
reaction
is
slow
a
mild
stimulant
may
be
taken
and
the
duration
of
the
bath
must
be
diminished
the
next
time
when
is
beneficial
improvement
is
soon
manifested
the
blood
becomes
richer
the
whole
system
is
strengthened
and
the
functions
are
performed
with
more
regularity
to
the
rich
is
a
luxury
but
it
is
a
remedy
beyond
the
reach
of
the
poorer
classes
unless
they
live
near
the
the
shower
bath
produces
a
shock
to
the
nervous
system
by
suddenly
coming
in
contact
with
the
skin
numerous
streams
of
cold
water
fall
upon
the
neck
shoulders
and
body
of
the
patient
who
stands
beneath
the
hose
or
reservoir
when
the
patient
is
plethoric
feeble
or
nervous
or
when
some
internal
organ
is
diseased
the
cold
shower
bath
should
be
employed
in
simple
debility
unaccompanied
by
inflammation
or
symptoms
of
internal
congestion
its
use
proves
advantageous
by
moderating
the
force
of
the
shower
and
substituting
tepid
water
the
most
delicate
persons
can
endure
it
and
profit
thereby
the
usual
means
for
inducing
a
good
reaction
friction
and
exercise
should
be
employed
the
douche
bath
consists
of
a
stream
of
water
dashed
or
thrown
upon
the
patient
from
a
moderate
height
or
distance
with
considerable
force
the
size
temperature
and
force
of
the
stream
may
be
modified
to
suit
the
exigencies
of
the
case
it
is
locally
employed
as
a
remedy
for
sprains
weak
or
stiff
joints
old
swellings
etc
the
cold
douche
bath
is
more
powerful
than
the
shower
bath
and
should
be
given
with
the
same
precautions
which
govern
the
application
of
the
latter
the
sponge
bath
admits
of
extensive
employment
in
both
acute
and
chronic
diseases
and
its
simplicity
renders
it
of
untold
value
it
consists
in
a
general
or
local
application
of
water
medicated
or
not
at
any
desired
temperature
the
quantity
may
be
great
or
small
to
suit
the
requirements
of
the
case
if
it
is
applied
in
acute
diseases
at
a
temperature
agreeable
to
the
patient
it
is
exceedingly
grateful
and
may
be
repeated
as
often
as
necessary
it
may
be
rendered
alkaline
by
the
addition
of
some
compound
of
soda
in
the
proportion
of
a
teaspoonful
to
a
quart
of
water
a
portion
of
the
body
may
be
bathed
at
a
time
and
quickly
dried
thus
avoiding
any
exposure
to
cold
it
removes
excessive
animal
heat
relaxes
the
capillaries
equalizes
the
circulation
and
produces
comfort
tranquility
and
sleep
nothing
is
more
conducive
to
the
health
and
comfort
of
laboring
men
in
summer
than
a
daily
bath
and
it
is
a
matter
of
regret
that
there
are
so
few
conveniences
for
the
purpose
in
most
homes
especially
those
in
the
country
farmers
in
particular
need
bathing
facilities
and
yet
in
most
cases
they
are
almost
entirely
without
them
for
their
benefit
we
will
describe
a
device
which
we
can
recommend
to
all
who
want
a
cheap
convenient
and
easily
managed
apparatus
for
sponge
bathing
in
the
the
articles
required
are
a
piece
of
a
yard
and
a
quarter
square
four
slats
two
inches
wide
and
three
feet
long
notched
at
the
ends
so
as
to
lock
together
in
the
form
of
a
square
and
a
large
sponge
the
slats
are
placed
upon
the
floor
and
the
rubber
cloth
is
spread
over
them
there
is
no
need
of
fastening
it
to
the
slats
forming
a
shallow
square
vessel
a
yard
wide
in
this
the
bather
stands
and
applies
the
water
with
a
sponge
from
a
basin
or
bowl
on
a
stand
placed
conveniently
near
there
need
be
no
danger
of
wetting
the
carpet
or
spoiling
the
furniture
when
the
bath
is
finished
gather
three
corners
of
the
rubber
cloth
in
the
left
hand
take
the
fourth
corner
in
the
right
in
such
a
way
as
to
form
a
spout
when
lifted
or
held
over
the
or
bucket
the
water
may
be
poured
out
in
a
moment
when
the
cloth
should
be
spread
over
the
back
of
a
chair
to
dry
and
the
slats
unlocked
and
set
away
in
a
closet
the
foot
bath
is
frequently
employed
as
a
means
of
causing
diaphoresis
in
colds
attacks
of
acute
diseases
and
also
to
draw
the
blood
from
the
head
or
some
internal
organ
it
is
a
powerful
auxiliary
in
the
treatment
of
those
chronic
diseases
in
which
inflammation
congestion
and
a
feeble
circulation
are
prominent
symptoms
the
water
should
be
as
hot
as
it
can
be
borne
and
the
temperature
kept
up
by
additions
of
hot
water
it
may
be
made
stimulating
by
the
addition
of
salt
mustard
ginger
or
cayenne
pepper
the
sitz
bath
a
tub
is
so
arranged
that
the
patient
can
sit
down
in
it
while
bathing
in
this
manner
the
lower
part
of
the
abdomen
hips
and
upper
part
of
the
thighs
are
immersed
in
whatever
fluid
the
bath
is
composed
of
it
is
applicable
in
diseases
of
the
pelvic
organs
and
may
be
hot
warm
cool
cold
or
medicated
according
to
the
effect
desired
the
bath
tub
should
be
large
enough
to
permit
a
thorough
rubbing
and
kneading
of
the
diseased
parts
and
the
patient
may
remain
in
it
from
ten
to
thirty
minutes
the
clothing
may
be
wholly
or
partially
removed
as
agreeable
to
the
individual
a
sitz
bath
is
an
effective
remedial
adjunct
in
menstrual
suppression
and
in
painful
menstruation
gravel
spasmodic
and
acute
inflammatory
affections
generally
the
sitz
bath
is
used
as
a
tonic
in
cases
of
relaxed
tissues
of
the
pelvis
in
debility
of
the
organs
in
piles
prolapsus
of
the
rectum
and
in
constipation
the
head
bath
a
shallow
basin
contains
the
fluid
for
the
bath
and
the
patient
assuming
a
recumbent
position
immerses
a
portion
of
the
head
generally
the
back
part
the
temperature
may
be
warm
cool
or
cold
as
desired
medicated
baths
are
infusions
of
vegetable
or
other
substances
in
water
they
are
sometimes
applied
with
the
sponge
though
generally
the
patient
is
immersed
the
temperature
at
which
they
are
usually
employed
is
that
of
the
tepid
bath
the
nature
and
strength
of
the
medication
depends
upon
the
character
of
the
disease
for
which
it
is
employed
the
alkaline
bath
is
prepared
by
dissolving
half
a
pound
of
carbonate
of
soda
in
sixty
gallons
of
water
it
is
useful
in
those
diseases
in
which
the
fluids
of
the
body
are
abnormally
acid
as
in
rheumatism
the
acid
bath
is
prepared
by
adding
two
pounds
of
muriatic
or
hydrochloric
acid
to
sixty
gallons
of
water
a
much
smaller
quantity
of
the
acid
is
sometimes
used
and
in
some
instances
vinegar
is
substituted
acid
is
composed
of
acid
aqua
regia
and
water
it
should
be
prepared
in
a
wooden
tub
and
a
sufficient
quantity
of
acid
used
to
give
the
water
a
sour
taste
it
is
extensively
used
in
india
as
a
remedy
for
disorders
of
the
liver
the
iodine
bath
is
composed
of
the
following
ingredients
tincture
of
iodine
two
drachms
iodide
of
potassium
four
drachms
water
forty
gallons
it
should
be
prepared
in
a
wooden
tub
it
reddens
the
skin
for
children
a
much
weaker
solution
must
be
employed
its
use
is
generally
restricted
to
scrofulous
and
tubercular
affections
the
sulphur
bath
is
prepared
by
dissolving
eight
ounces
of
sulphuret
of
potassium
and
two
ounces
of
dilute
sulphuric
acid
in
sixty
gallons
of
water
the
acid
may
be
omitted
a
sulphur
is
often
employed
in
cities
where
the
necessary
apparatus
can
be
procured
it
may
be
improvised
by
placing
sulphur
on
a
shovel
over
hot
coals
the
patient
should
be
prepared
as
in
the
spirit
and
burning
sulphur
substituted
for
the
liquor
the
patient
is
then
enveloped
in
the
fumes
of
sulphurous
oxide
heating
a
mixture
of
sulphur
and
sulphuric
acid
produces
the
same
result
if
the
gas
is
inhaled
in
large
quantities
it
causes
irritation
of
the
respiratory
passages
and
suffocation
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
the
coverings
should
be
securely
fastened
at
the
neck
and
that
the
room
be
one
which
can
be
quickly
filled
with
pure
air
this
bath
is
used
in
cutaneous
rheumatic
and
syphilitic
disorders
fomentations
consist
of
the
general
or
local
application
of
woolen
cloths
wrung
out
of
hot
water
they
should
not
be
so
light
as
to
be
ineffectual
nor
so
heavy
as
to
be
burdensome
they
should
not
be
wet
enough
to
drip
nor
applied
so
as
to
expose
the
body
to
the
surrounding
air
a
fresh
cloth
should
be
ready
for
application
before
the
first
one
is
removed
and
the
change
quickly
effected
fomentations
are
effectual
in
relieving
congestion
and
inflammation
the
wet
sheet
pack
as
this
remedial
appliance
will
be
frequently
recommended
in
the
pages
following
its
mode
of
application
is
here
described
take
a
pail
half
filled
with
cold
water
gather
together
one
end
of
a
common
cotton
sheet
and
immerse
it
allowing
it
to
remain
while
preparing
the
bed
which
may
be
done
as
follows
remove
all
the
except
a
coverlet
and
the
pillows
then
spread
upon
it
in
the
following
order
two
ordinary
comforters
one
woolen
blanket
one
woolen
sheet
or
two
woolen
sheets
if
a
woolen
blanket
is
not
at
hand
then
wring
out
or
of
the
water
from
the
wet
sheet
spread
it
smoothly
upon
the
blanket
and
the
patient
being
undressed
places
himself
on
the
sheet
with
his
arms
extended
while
an
assistant
wraps
him
closely
and
tightly
with
it
as
quickly
as
possible
each
arm
may
be
thus
covered
by
the
wet
sheet
or
may
lie
outside
of
it
and
be
covered
by
wet
towels
prepared
in
the
same
manner
as
the
sheet
then
quickly
and
tightly
cover
with
the
blankets
and
comforters
tucking
snugly
from
head
to
foot
the
head
should
also
be
covered
with
a
wet
towel
and
a
bottle
of
warm
water
placed
to
the
feet
or
near
enough
to
keep
them
warm
after
the
first
shock
of
the
chill
is
over
the
pack
is
very
pleasant
and
refreshing
and
the
patient
should
go
to
sleep
if
possible
the
ordinary
time
for
a
patient
to
remain
in
a
pack
is
about
sixty
minutes
thirty
or
forty
minutes
is
sufficient
if
he
is
in
a
feeble
condition
never
wring
the
sheet
out
of
warm
water
for
one
of
its
principal
benefits
comes
from
the
vigorous
reaction
induced
by
its
cold
temperature
after
remaining
in
the
pack
from
thirty
to
sixty
minutes
allow
the
patient
to
stand
on
his
feet
if
he
is
able
and
have
the
whole
surface
of
his
body
bathed
rub
briskly
and
dry
with
towels
or
by
throwing
over
the
body
a
dry
sheet
and
then
rubbing
him
the
dry
sheet
retains
the
bodily
warmth
and
is
more
comfortable
but
interferes
with
the
completeness
and
vigor
of
the
rubbing
of
the
body
be
sure
and
establish
full
reaction
which
may
be
known
by
the
warmth
of
the
surface
frequently
when
the
patient
is
released
from
the
pack
and
is
being
bathed
rolls
of
scales
scurf
and
come
off
thus
giving
palpable
evidence
of
the
utility
of
the
pack
in
freeing
the
myriads
of
pores
of
the
skin
of
effete
matter
it
is
efficient
in
fevers
and
for
breaking
up
colds
and
is
a
very
valuable
remedial
agent
in
most
chronic
diseases
assisting
in
removing
causes
which
depress
the
bodily
functions
motion
is
a
remedial
agent
the
stability
of
the
planetary
system
depends
upon
the
converted
motion
of
its
parts
so
in
the
human
system
motion
is
a
fundamental
principle
which
underlies
every
vital
process
health
consists
in
normal
functional
activity
the
human
system
is
the
arena
of
various
kinds
of
motions
both
of
fluids
and
of
solids
and
life
and
health
depend
upon
these
physiological
movements
there
are
the
movements
incident
to
the
expansion
and
contraction
of
the
walls
of
the
chest
bringing
the
oxygen
of
the
air
into
contact
with
the
blood
as
it
circulates
through
the
lungs
corresponding
with
the
movements
of
the
chest
are
the
of
the
abdominal
which
promote
the
functions
of
the
organs
of
the
abdominal
cavity
there
are
of
the
heart
and
which
urge
the
blood
out
to
the
extremities
and
diffuse
it
through
every
part
of
the
system
and
also
of
the
blood
in
the
by
which
the
blood
is
circulated
through
the
tissues
that
the
latter
may
be
built
up
from
its
nutritive
constituents
then
there
is
the
of
the
vital
in
the
veins
returning
towards
the
heart
and
urged
forward
by
the
muscular
and
action
of
the
chest
and
abdominal
walls
the
peristaltic
of
the
stomach
and
urge
onward
digesting
materials
exposing
them
successively
to
different
solvents
and
aiding
the
absorption
of
nutritive
matter
no
less
essential
to
life
and
health
are
numerous
other
minute

the

that

shall
be

the
act

force
which

in

requires
the
simultaneous

muscular

are
dependent
upon
activities
which
cause

not
only
is
this
true
in
a
general
way
but
it
is
also
true
that
the
energy
produced
by
the
operations
of
the
vital
system
has
a
strict
relation
to
the
wasting
products
that
energy
is

attained
by

since

without

disturbance
is
at
once
produced
in
the

similar
to
that
resulting
from
the
introduction
of
foreign

these
disturbances
constitute
disease
the
more
obvious
effects
of
lack
of
waste
and
elimination
are
mechanical
the
circulation
is
loaded
with
effete
and
useless
matter
the
vessels
being
thereby
weakened
and
distended
and
the
circulation
retarded
the
capillaries
become
clogged

is
diminished
local

and
other
pathological
results

deranged
or
suppressed

and
indeed
constitutes
all
departures
from
health
which
we
call
disease

indicates

but
action
which
is
perverted
into
wrong
channels
or
action
in
one
part
at
the
expense
of

in
other
parts

a
disturbance
in

or
mechanical

for
the
treatment
of
chronic
diseases
to
correct
and
restore
deranged
movements
thereby
producing
normal
functional
activity
of
every
organ
and
part
of
the
system
must
therefore
be
the
chief
object
of
the
physician
all
remedies
of
whatever
school
or
nature
imply
motion
and
depend
for
their
efficacy
upon
their
ability
to
excite
motion
in
some
one
or
more
elements
organs
or
parts
of
the
system
while
we
do
not
wish
to
detract
from
the
real
merits
of
medicine
as
a
curative
agent
yet
we
must
admit
that
the
remedial
power
of
motion
transmitted
either
manually
or
mechanically
is
founded
upon
rational
and
physiological
principles
all
systems
of
medicine
however
much
they
may
differ
superficially
propose
as
the
chief
end
to
be
attained
by
the
administration
of
medicine
or
by
other
treatment
that
identical
with
physiological
activity
should
be
incited
or
promoted
how
best
to
accomplish
this
result
and
with
least
cost
to
vitality
is
an
important
consideration
bearing
in
mind
the
conservation
of
forces
that
energy
or
power
is
as
indestructible
as
matter
that
it
may
be
changed
into
other
forms
but
never
lost
it
is
plain
that
mechanical
force
may
be
applied
to
the
living
system
and
transformed
into
vital
energy
that
chemical
action
animal
heat
and
magnetism
may
represent
in
the
system
the
mechanical
force
transmitted
to
the
body
keeping
in
view
the
transformable
nature
of
force
and
the
need
that
our
systems
have
of
auxiliary
power
in
different
departments
when
normal
activity
is
impaired
by
disease
we
can
readily
understand
how
undoubted
curative
effects
result
from
either
the
manual
or
the
mechanical
administration
of
motion
rubbing
is
a
process
universally
employed
by
physicians
of
every
school
for
the
relief
of
a
great
diversity
of
distressing
symptoms
is
instinctively
resorted
to
by
sympathizers
and
attendants
upon
the
sick
and
constitutes
one
of
the
chief
duties
of
the
nurse
uncivilized
people
resort
to
this
process
as
their
principal
remedy
in
all
forms
of
disease
the
difficulty
in
administering
motion
as
a
remedial
agent
by
manual
effort
such
as
rubbing
kneading
oscillating
flexing
and
extending
the
limbs
lies
in
the
impossibility
of
supplying
the
and
of
movement
required
to
make
it
most
effective
the
power
of
the
arm
and
the
strength
of
the
operator
are
exhausted
before
the
desired
effect
is
produced
inventive
genius
has
at
last
overcome
the
obstacles
to
the
successful
and
perfect
administration
of
motion
as
a
curative
agent
we
have
now
a
series
of
machines
propelled
by
mechanical
power
by
the
use
of
which
we
rub
knead
manipulate
and
apply
in
succession
a
great
variety
of
movements
to
all
parts
of
the
body
these
machines
transmit
motion
to
the
body
from
inexhaustible
sources
never
tire
but
are
ever
ready
for
new
remedial
conquests
the
movements
administered
by
their
use
entirely
under
the
control
of
the
are
never
disagreeable
and
are
far
more
rapid
and
intense
than
can
possibly
be
given
by
the
hands
by
the
application
of
short
quick
movements
of
from
to
fifteen
hundred
vibrations
a
organs
and
parts
are
reached
to
which
motion
is
transmitted
and
in
which
vital
energy
is
thereby
generated
the
hands
have
not
the
power
by
kneading
manipulating
or
rubbing
to
impress
the
system
except
in
a
very
mild
degree
and
organs
and
parts
are
scarcely
influenced
by
the
comparatively
slow
movements
thus
administered
among
the
most
important
mechanical
inventions
devised
for
administering
motion
as
a
remedial
agent
is
one
which
has
received
the
name
of
the
the
manipulator
with
this
machine
motion
can
be
applied
to
any
organ
or
part
of
the
system
and
intensity
of
the
application
regulated
to
a
nicety
the
rapidity
of
motion
necessary
to
produce
active
exhilaration
of
any
part
of
the
body
is
easily
secured
by
the
use
of
the
manipulator
but
is
far
beyond
the
power
of
the
hands
the
degree
of
circulation
given
to
the
fluids
both
inside
and
outside
of
the
vessels
and
of
energy
imparted
to
the
organs
and
parts
operated
upon
by
the
manipulator
is
also
unapproachable
by
the
application
of
manual
power
effects
upon
the
circulation
and
nutrition
the
influence
of
motion
on
these
functions
is
as
follows
the
contents
of
the
are
moved
onward
by
the
pressure
and
motion
transmitted
by
the
manipulator
all
backward
movement
of
the
blood
being
prevented
by
the
valves
of
the
veins
and
by
the
propelling
power
of
the
heart
and
arteries
fluids
outside
these
vessels
pass
through
their
walls
to
take
the
place
of
the
stagnant
blood
that
has
been
moved
onward
other
blood
flows
into
the
part
and
thus
active
and
healthy
circulation
is
induced
and
nutritive
material
capable
of
affording
vital
support
is
also
brought
to
refresh
the
local
part
we
have
found
mechanical
movements
especially
effectual
in
paralysis
neuralgia
sleeplessness
and
other
nervous
affections
in
derangements
of
the
liver
constipation
and
dyspepsia
in
displacements
of
the
uterus
and
congestion
and
inflammation
of
the
pelvic
organs

a
complete
description
of
the
mechanical
movements
and
the
machinery
employed
in
the
treatment
of

and

institute
the

is
referred
to
the
appendix
to
this

chapter
iv
hygienic
treatment
of
the
sick
there
are
two
essentials
requisite
to
the
successful
treatment
of
the
sick
medical
skill
good
nursing
the
former
is
necessary
in
order
that
the
condition
of
the
patient
be
fully
understood
and
the
proper
means
be
employed
to
effect
his
recovery
the
latter
is
essential
in
order
that
all
influences
favoring
the
production
and
development
of
disease
may
be
removed
the
tendencies
to
restoration
be
promoted
by
every
possible
means
and
the
directions
of
the
physician
be
properly
observed
success
in
the
treatment
of
the
sick
requires
good
nursing
without
it
the
most
skillful
physicians
fail
to
effect
a
cure
with
it
the
most
unqualified
may
succeed
if
certain
hygienic
agencies
are
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
health
how
much
more
necessary
it
is
that
they
be
employed
in
sickness
if
certain
conditions
cause
disease
how
great
the
necessity
is
that
such
conditions
be
obviated
and
hygienic
ones
substituted
notwithstanding
the
importance
of
good
nursing
in
the
rural
districts
it
is
frequently
difficult
to
find
a
professional
nurse
or
if
one
can
be
obtained
it
is
often
impossible
for
the
invalid
to
procure
such
services
on
account
of
the
expense
which
must
necessarily
be
incurred
hence
this
office
usually
devolves
upon
some
relative
who
is
considered
to
be
the
best
qualified
for
the
position
or
as
is
often
the
case
necessity
demands
that
the
patient
be
left
to
a
change
of
nurses
a
woman
is
generally
selected
for
this
important
position
her
soft
hand
and
soothing
voice
her
kindly
sympathetic
and
provident
nature
together
with
her
scrupulous
cleanliness
render
her
man
equal
if
not
his
superior
in
the
capacity
of
nurse
there
are
circumstances
however
in
which
the
services
of
a
man
are
indispensable
hence
the
necessity
that
all
should
be
qualified
to
care
for
the
sick
a
nurse
should
be
attentive
to
the
requirements
of
physician
and
patient
for
she
sustains
an
intimate
relation
to
both
she
should
observe
the
directions
of
the
physician
and
faithfully
perform
them
she
should
note
all
the
symptoms
of
the
patient
and
do
everything
in
her
power
to
promote
comfort
and
recovery
she
should
anticipate
the
wishes
and
not
cause
the
patient
to
ask
for
everything
which
is
desired
so
far
as
practicable
let
the
wishes
be
gratified
the
senses
of
the
sick
often
become
morbidly
acute
and
those
things
which
in
health
would
pass
unnoticed
in
sickness
are
so
magnified
as
to
occasion
annoyance
and
vexation
sick
persons
are
not
all
alike
and
the
peculiarities
of
each
must
be
studied
separately
the
nurse
must
be
but
and
not
yield
to
such
whims
of
the
patient
as
may
be
detrimental
to
recovery
neither
must
she
arouse
dislike
or
anger
by
opposition
but
endeavor
to
the
patient
from
all
delusions
the
feelings
of
the
patient
should
never
be
trifled
with
for
idealities
become
realities
the
nurse
should
possess
an
inexhaustible
store
of
patience
disease
affects
the
mind
of
the
patient
and
fills
it
with
strange
delusions
the
sick
are
often
querulous
fretful
and
unreasonable
and
should
be
treated
with
kindness
forbearance
and
sympathy
the
nurse
should
always
be
cheerful
look
on
the
bright
side
of
every
circumstance
animate
them
with
encouragement
and
inspire
them
with
hope
hope
is
one
of
the
best
of
tonics
it
stimulates
the
flagging
vital
energies
and
imparts
new
life
to
the
weak
and
exhausted
forces
gloom
sadness
and
despondency
depress
the
vital
forces
and
lead
to
death
we
have
seen
patients
rapidly
sinking
who
had
given
up
all
hope
and
were
quietly
awaiting
the
coming
of
death
snatched
as
it
were
from
its
grasp
and
restored
to
health
by
words
of
cheer
and
encouragement
the
nurse
should
possess
which
alone
can
win
the
confidence
of
the
patient
she
should
have
judgment
circumspection
intelligence
forethought
alacrity
carefulness
and
neatness
in
a
word
she
should
exercise
we
deem
it
but
justice
to
say
a
word
in
behalf
of
the
nurse
she
too
is
a
human
being
subject
to
disease
and
unless
hygienic
conditions
be
observed
will
soon
be
stricken
low
by
its
presence
she
must
be
relieved
occasionally
and
get
rest
or
she
can
not
long
withstand
the
combined
influence
of
fatigue
and
disease
her
office
is
an
arduous
one
at
best
and
the
long
weary
hours
of
should
be
compensated
by
exercise
in
the
open
air
as
well
as
by
sleep
during
the
day
unless
this
be
done
the
system
will
become
exhausted
and
sleep
will
intrude
itself
upon
her
at
the
time
when
the
greatest
diligence
is
required
for
the
welfare
of
the
patient
when
the
vital
powers
are
at
their
lowest
ebb
she
should
be
supplied
with
plenty
of
suitable
food
during
the
night
to
sustain
her
and
to
serve
as
a
safeguard
against
the
invasion
of
disease
she
should
be
treated
with
kindness
and
respect
else
her
disposition
may
become
morose
and
reflect
itself
upon
the
patient
causing
peevishness
and
despondency
the
should
be
as
comfortable
cheerful
and
pleasant
as
circumstances
will
allow
let
the
room
be
large
and
airy
and
furnished
with
a
stove
or
better
still
a
fireplace
all
articles
of
clothing
and
furniture
not
necessary
to
the
comfort
of
the
patient
should
be
removed
from
the
room
and
in
or
diseases
the
carpets
even
should
not
be
permitted
to
remain
the
surroundings
beget
happiness
or
gloom
in
proportion
as
they
are
pleasant
or
disagreeable
a
tidy
attendant
a
few
flowers
and
books
wonderfully
enhance
the
cheerfulness
of
the
room
permit
no
unnecessary
accumulation
of
bottles
or
any
thing
that
can
in
any
way
render
the
room
unpleasant
medicines
drink
or
nourishment
should
never
be
left
uncovered
in
the
since
they
quickly
absorb
the
gaseous
emanations
from
the
patient
and
become
unfit
for
the
purpose
which
they
were
intended
to
serve
their
presence
gives
the
room
an
untidy
appearance
suggestive
of
filth
and
slovenliness
and
imparts
to
the
patient
a
feeling
of
loathing
and
disgust
for
articles
of
diet
the
bed
should
not
be
of
feathers
on
account
of
their
undue
warmth
which
causes
a
sensation
of
languor
throughout
the
system
a
husk
or
mattress
or
even
a
straw
bed
covered
with
a
cotton
quilt
is
far
preferable
the
bedding
should
be
changed
frequently
it
is
better
that
the
bed
should
be
away
from
the
wall
so
as
to
admit
of
greater
freedom
of
movement
about
it
pure
air
the
air
in
the
should
be
kept
as
pure
as
possible
that
which
is
so
necessary
in
health
is
indispensable
in
sickness
the
importance
therefore
of
a
perfect
and
free
ventilation
of
the
can
not
be
too
thoroughly
impressed
and
yet
to
properly
secure
this
end
may
call
forth
a
considerable
amount
of
ingenuity
on
the
part
of
the
nurse
a
window
should
be
open
but
the
current
of
air
must
not
be
allowed
to
blow
directly
upon
the
patient
one
window
may
be
raised
from
the
bottom
and
another
lowered
from
the
top
this
will
permit
the
entrance
of
pure
air
from
without
and
the
exit
of
the
vitiated
air
from
within
the
patient
if
sufficiently
covered
in
bed
is
not
liable
to
take
cold
from
a
proper
ventilation
of
the
room
especially
is
this
true
when
the
bodily
temperature
is
raised
by
febrile
or
inflammatory
affections
the
of
a
room
is
no
indication
of
the
of
the
air
it
is
a
prevalent
but
mistaken
notion
that
when
a
room
is
cold
the
air
must
be
pure
cold
air
is
as
readily
contaminated
with
impurities
as
warm
air
therefore
it
is
not
sufficient
that
the
room
be
kept
cool
but
the
air
should
be
frequently
changed
during
convalescence
great
care
is
necessary
to
protect
the
patient
from
taking
cold
air
which
is
admitted
into
the
should
not
be
contaminated
by
passing
over
foul
drains
privies
or
other
sources
of
infection
since
instead
of
invigorating
it
depresses
the
physical
forces
and
generates
disease
light
is
as
necessary
to
health
as
is
pure
air
banish
either
for
any
continuous
period
of
time
and
serious
results
follow
the
strong
robust
man
when
deprived
of
light
soon
degenerates
into
a
feeble
sickly
being
and
finally
dies
according
to
the
investigations
of
the
massachusetts
medical
society
it
was
found
that
absence
of
sunlight
together
with
moisture
not
only
favor
the
development
of
tubercular
consumption
but
act
as
an
exciting
cause
it
is
well
known
that
persons
living
in
shaded
dwellings
often
suffer
from
forms
of
disease
which
resist
all
treatment
until
proper
admission
of
light
is
secured
the
physician
to
the
emperor
of
russia
found
upon
examination
that
patients
confined
in
well
lighted
wards
were
four
times
as
liable
to
recover
as
were
those
in
poorly
lighted
rooms
children
reared
away
from
the
sunlight
are
apt
to
be
deformed
and
idiotic
while
those
partially
deformed
have
been
restored
by
being
admitted
to
the
light
patients
sometimes
wish
to
have
their
rooms
darkened
because
the
light
is
painful
to
their
weak
and
sensitive
eyes
it
is
far
better
to
shade
the
eyes
and
admit
the
sunlight
into
the
room
since
its
rays
cause
chemical
changes
to
take
place
which
favor
the
return
of
health
many
invalids
can
ascribe
their
recovery
to
the
influence
of
a
sun
bath
there
are
however
conditions
in
which
the
patients
should
be
screened
from
the
light
in
such
cases
a
little
arrangement
of
the
curtains
or
shutters
will
accomplish
all
that
is
to
be
desired
patients
convalescing
from
acute
or
suffering
from
chronic
diseases
should
receive
the
influence
of
light
in
the
open
air
and
be
in
it
several
hours
every
day
light
and
pure
air
stimulate
a
healthful
development
induce
cheerfulness
hope
and
recovery
while
darkness
begets
gloom
sadness
despondency
disease
and
ultimately
death
warmth
is
essential
to
the
of
the
patient
and
it
is
necessary
that
a
proper
temperature
be
maintained
in
the
room
except
in
very
warm
weather
a
little
fire
should
be
kept
in
the
room
and
at
the
same
time
fresh
air
should
be
admitted
from
without
and
a
uniform
temperature
thus
preserved
this
arrangement
is
especially
necessary
in
localities
where
great
variations
in
temperature
are
experienced
during
the
day
and
night
the
normal
temperature
of
the
body
ranges
from
to
fahr
the
minimum
occurs
from
to
the
maximum
from
to
the
deviation
of
a
few
degrees
from
this
standard
indicates
disease
and
the
greater
the
deviation
the
greater
is
its
severity
during
the
early
stages
of
acute
diseases
the
animal
heat
is
generally
increased
and
should
be
allayed
by
bathing
and
cooling
or
acidulated
drinks
in
the
latter
stages
the
temperature
becomes
diminished
and
the
condition
of
the
system
is
favorable
to
congestions
which
are
most
likely
to
occur
between
the
hours
of
and
when
the
vital
powers
are
lowest
the
patient
then
becomes
feeble
his
extremities
grow
cold
and
he
has
what
is
termed
a
sinking
spell
and
perhaps
dies
it
is
during
these
hours
that
additional
covering
the
application
of
hot
bricks
to
the
feet
and
bottles
of
hot
water
to
the
limbs
and
body
friction
upon
the
surface
stimulating
drinks
and
increased
vigilance
on
the
part
of
the
nurse
will
often
save
the
patient
life
but
unfortunately
at
these
hours
the
nurse
is
apt
to
get
sleepy
and
inattentive
the
demands
of
the
patient
go
unheeded
and
a
sacrifice
of
life
is
the
result
persons
suffering
from
chronic
diseases
or
those
in
feeble
health
should
preserve
their
vital
energies
by
dressing
warmly
by
wearing
flannels
next
to
the
skin
and
by
carefully
protecting
the
feet
from
cold
and
moisture
cleanliness
can
not
be
too
thoroughly
impressed
upon
the
minds
of
those
who
have
the
care
of
the
sick
filthiness
is
productive
of
disease
and
favorable
to
its
development
bathing
at
least
once
a
day
with
pure
soft
water
and
is
strongly
urged
and
as
this
is
designed
for
cleanliness
the
temperature
of
the
bath
should
be
made
agreeable
to
the
patient
the
clothing
and
bedding
of
the
patient
in
acute
diseases
should
be
changed
frequently
and
thoroughly
aired
if
not
washed
as
soon
as
removed
these
articles
should
be
taken
from
the
room
replaced
by
others
aired
and
the
hands
and
face
of
the
patient
should
be
bathed
frequently
the
hair
combed
the
teeth
brushed
the
nails
cleaned
the
lips
moistened
and
everything
about
him
kept
clean
and
tidy
these
observances
although
in
themselves
trifling
promote
comfort
and
cheerfulness
and
contribute
largely
to
the
recovery
of
the
sick
all
excretions
from
the
patient
should
be
buried
and
not
committed
to
privies
to
communicate
disease
to
those
who
frequent
them
the
diet
contains
a
very
important
relation
to
health
during
the
process
of
acute
disease
the
appetite
is
generally
much
impaired
if
not
entirely
absent
it
should
then
be
the
study
of
the
nurse
to
devise
such
articles
of
nourishment
as
will
be
acceptable
to
the
patient
and
suitable
to
the
condition
the
food
should
be
light
nutritious
and
easy
of
digestion
each
individual
disease
requires
a
diet
adapted
to
its
peculiarities
those
of
an
inflammatory
character
require
an
unstimulating
diet
as
gruel
toast
etc
an
exhausted
or
enfeebled
condition
of
the
brain
unattended
by
irritability
demands
a
stimulating
diet
as
beef
eggs
fish
graham
bread
oysters
etc
in
wasting
diseases
in
which
the
temperature
of
the
system
is
low
beef
fatty
substances
rich
milk
sweet
cream
and
other
carbonaceous
articles
of
diet
are
recommended
in
the
various
forms
of
chronic
ailments
the
diet
must
be
varied
according
to
the
nature
of
the
disease
and
the
peculiarities
of
the
patient
deranged
digestion
is
generally
an
accompaniment
of
chronic
disease
a
return
to
normal
digestion
should
be
encouraged
by
selecting
appropriate
articles
of
food
paying
due
regard
to
its
quantity
and
quality
as
well
as
to
the
manner
and
time
of
eating
the
appearance
of
food
and
the
manner
in
which
it
is
offered
have
much
to
do
with
its
acceptance
or
rejection
by
the
patient
let
the
nourishment
be
presented
in
a
nice
clean
dish
of
a
size
and
shape
appropriate
to
the
quantity
more
food
than
can
be
eaten
by
the
patient
should
not
be
placed
before
him
at
one
time
since
a
great
quantity
excites
disgust
and
loathing
in
taking
nourishment
drink
or
medicine
the
patient
if
feeble
should
not
be
obliged
to
change
his
position
milk
is
one
of
the
most
important
foods
in
fevers
and
acute
diseases
attended
with
great
prostration
and
in
which
the
digestive
powers
are
enfeebled
it
contains
within
itself
all
the
elements
of
nutrition
beef
tea
furnishes
an
excellent
nourishment
for
the
sick
but
there
are
few
even
among
professional
nurses
who
know
how
to
properly
prepare
it
we
give
three
good
recipes
one
method
is
to
chip
up
lean
beef
put
it
in
a
porcelain
or
tin
saucepan
cover
it
with
water
and
bring
it
up
to
just
below
the
boiling
point
at
which
temperature
for
ten
minutes
then
season
and
serve
another
method
is
similar
to
the
foregoing
with
this
difference
that
the
juices
of
the
meat
are
squeezed
through
a
piece
of
muslin
or
crash
making
the
tea
richer
another
way
which
we
consider
preferable
to
either
of
the
above
is
to
take
lean
beef
cut
it
into
fine
bits
put
them
in
a
tightly
covered
vessel
which
is
placed
in
a
kettle
of
water
kept
boiling
thus
the
whole
strength
of
the
juice
will
be
obtained
from
the
meat
without
losing
any
of
its
properties
it
can
be
seasoned
to
the
taste
and
reduced
with
water
to
suit
the
needs
of
the
patient
sleep
is
nature
grand
restorer
a
balm
to
all
mankind
the
best
comforter
of
that
sad
heart
whom
fortune
spite
assails
it
is
necessary
in
health
and
doubly
so
in
sickness
during
sleep
the
vital
energies
recuperate
the
forces
are
less
rapidly
expended
and
the
strength
increases
it
is
the
great
source
of
rest
and
refreshment
often
a
day
rest
in
bed
free
from
the
cares
and
anxieties
of
an
active
life
is
sufficient
to
ward
off
the
approach
of
disease
if
quiet
and
rest
are
essential
to
recuperation
in
health
their
necessity
in
disease
must
be
apparent
life
frequently
depends
on
tranquility
and
repose
and
the
least
noise
or
confusion
disturbs
the
sufferer
and
diminishes
the
chances
of
recovery
nothing
annoys
sick
or
nervous
persons
more
than
whispering
and
the
rustling
of
newspapers
if
conversation
be
necessary
let
the
tones
be
modified
but
never
whisper
in
sickness
when
the
vital
forces
are
low
the
more
natural
rest
and
sleep
the
patient
obtains
the
greater
is
the
prospect
for
recovery
as
a
rule
patient
should
never
be
awakened
when
sleeping
not
even
to
take
unless
in
if
the
patient
does
not
sleep
the
cause
should
be
ascertained
and
the
appropriate
remedies
employed
if
it
arise
from
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
cooling
lotions
should
be
applied
and
warmth
to
the
feet
if
from
restlessness
or
general
irritability
a
sponge
bath
followed
by
friction
should
be
administered
if
the
wakefulness
is
due
to
noise
or
confusion
quiet
is
the
remedy
when
these
means
fail
anodynes
or
nervines
should
be
employed
lying
on
the
side
instead
of
on
the
back
should
be
practiced
patients
afflicted
with
chronic
diseases
on
rising
should
take
a
cold
bath
dry
the
surface
quickly
with
a
coarse
towel
followed
by
friction
with
the
hand
great
benefit
may
be
derived
by
following
these
suggestions
when
the
nature
of
the
disease
is
not
such
as
to
forbid
it
exercise
and
rest
necessarily
alternate
with
each
other
exercise
so
necessary
to
health
in
many
forms
of
disease
greatly
contributes
to
recovery
it
sends
the
sluggish
blood
coursing
through
the
veins
and
arteries
with
increased
force
and
rapidity
so
that
it
reaches
every
part
of
the
system
supplying
it
with
nourishment
it
increases
the
waste
of
old
material
and
creates
a
demand
for
new
convalescing
patients
or
those
suffering
from
chronic
diseases
whenever
the
weather
will
permit
should
take
exercise
every
day
in
the
open
air
this
should
be
done
with
regularity
the
amount
of
exercise
must
be
regulated
by
the
strength
of
the
patient
never
take
so
much
as
to
produce
fatigue
but
as
the
strength
increases
the
exercise
may
be
increased
proportionately
some
interesting
employment
commensurate
with
the
patient
strength
should
be
instituted
so
that
the
mind
may
be
agreeably
occupied
with
the
body
when
unable
to
take
active
exercise
the
invalid
properly
protected
by
sufficient
clothing
should
ride
in
a
carriage
or
boat
and
each
day
a
new
route
should
be
chosen
so
that
a
change
of
scenery
may
be
observed
thus
arousing
new
trains
of
thought
which
will
be
exhilarating
and
prove
beneficial
to
him
sexual
influences
during
the
progress
of
disease
or
convalescence
entire
continence
must
be
observed
it
is
then
necessary
that
all
of
the
vital
energies
should
be
employed
in
effecting
a
recovery
from
disease
without
having
the
additional
tax
imposed
of
overcoming
the
debilitating
effects
of
sexual
expenditure
this
holds
true
with
regard
to
all
diseases
and
especially
those
of
the
nervous
system
and
genitourinary
organs
visiting
the
sick
may
be
productive
of
good
or
evil
results
mental
impressions
made
upon
the
sick
exert
a
powerful
influence
upon
the
termination
of
disease
the
chances
of
recovery
are
in
proportion
to
the
elevation
or
depression
of
spirits
pleasant
cheerful
associations
animate
the
patient
inspire
hope
arouse
the
vital
energies
and
aid
in
his
recovery
while
disagreeable
and
melancholy
associations
beget
sadness
and
despondency
discourage
the
patient
depress
the
vital
powers
enfeeble
the
body
and
retard
recovery
unless
persons
who
visit
the
sick
can
carry
with
them
joy
hope
mirth
and
animation
they
had
better
stay
away
this
applies
equally
in
acute
and
chronic
diseases
it
does
not
matter
what
a
visitor
may
with
regard
to
the
patient
recovery
unfavorable
opinion
should
never
find
expression
in
the
life
hangs
upon
a
brittle
thread
and
often
that
frail
support
is
cheer
the
sick
by
words
of
encouragement
and
the
hold
on
life
will
be
strengthened
discourage
by
uttering
such
expressions
as
how
bad
you
look
why
how
you
have
failed
since
i
saw
you
last
i
would
have
another
doctor
one
who
knows
something
you
ca
live
long
if
you
do
get
help
and
the
tie
which
binds
them
to
earth
is
snapped
asunder
the
visitor
becomes
a
let
all
persons
be
guided
by
this
rule
go
into
the
without
carrying
with
you
a
few
rays
of
sunshine
if
the
patient
is
very
weak
the
visitor
may
injure
him
by
staying
too
long
the
length
of
the
visit
should
be
graduated
according
to
the
strength
of
the
invalid
never
let
the
sufferer
be
wearied
by
too
frequent
or
too
lengthy
visits
nor
by
having
too
many
visitors
at
once
above
all
things
do
not
confine
your
visitations
to
sunday
many
do
this
and
give
themselves
credit
for
an
extra
amount
of
piety
on
account
of
it
when
if
they
would
scrutinize
their
motives
more
carefully
they
would
see
that
it
was
but
a
contemptible
resort
to
save
time
the
sick
are
often
grossly
neglected
during
the
week
only
to
be
visited
to
death
upon
sunday
the
use
of
tobacco
and
opium
the
recovery
of
the
sick
is
often
delayed
sometimes
entirely
prevented
by
the
habitual
use
of
tobacco
or
opium
in
acute
diseases
the
appetite
for
tobacco
is
usually
destroyed
by
the
force
of
the
disease
and
its
use
is
of
necessity
discontinued
but
in
chronic
ailments
the
appetite
remains
unchanged
and
the
patient
continues
his
indulgence
greatly
to
the
aggravation
of
the
malady
the
use
of
tobacco
is
a
pernicious
habit
in
whatever
form
it
is
introduced
into
the
system
its
active
principle
nicotin
which
is
an
energetic
poison
exerts
its
specific
effect
on
the
nervous
system
tending
to
stimulate
it
to
an
unnatural
degree
of
activity
the
final
result
of
which
is
weakness
or
even
paralysis
the
horse
under
the
action
of
whip
and
spur
may
exhibit
great
spirit
and
rapid
movements
but
urge
him
beyond
his
strength
with
these
agents
and
you
inflict
a
lasting
injury
withhold
the
stimulants
and
the
drooping
head
and
moping
pace
indicate
the
sad
reaction
which
has
taken
place
this
illustrates
the
evils
of
habitually
exciting
the
nerves
by
the
use
of
tobacco
opium
narcotic
or
other
drugs
under
their
action
the
tone
of
the
system
is
greatly
impaired
and
it
responds
more
feebly
to
the
influence
of
curative
agents
tobacco
itself
when
its
use
becomes
habitual
and
excessive
gives
rise
to
the
most
unpleasant
and
dangerous
pathological
conditions
oppressive
torpor
weakness
or
loss
of
intellect
softening
of
the
brain
paralysis
nervous
debility
dyspepsia
functional
derangement
of
the
heart
and
diseases
of
the
liver
and
kidneys
are
not
uncommon
consequences
of
the
excessive
employment
of
this
plant
a
sense
of
faintness
nausea
giddiness
dryness
of
the
throat
tremblings
feelings
of
fear
disquietude
and
general
nervous
prostration
must
frequently
warn
persons
addicted
to
this
habit
that
they
are
sapping
the
very
foundation
of
health
under
the
continued
operation
of
a
poison
inducing
such
symptoms
as
these
what
chance
is
there
for
remedies
to
accomplish
their
specific
action
with
the
system
already
thoroughly
charged
with
an
influence
antagonistic
to
their
own
and
which
is
sure
to
neutralize
their
effect
what
good
can
medicine
do
king
says
a
patient
under
treatment
should
give
up
the
use
of
tobacco
or
his
physician
should
assume
no
responsibility
in
his
case
further
than
to
do
the
best
he
can
for
him
in
our
own
extensive
experience
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
diseases
we
have
often
found
it
necessary
to
resort
to
the
same
restriction
the
opium
habit
to
which
allusion
has
also
been
made
is
open
to
the
same
objections
and
must
be
abandoned
by
all
who
would
seek
recovery
part
iv
diseases
and
their
remedial
treatment
introduction
knowledge
which
is
conducive
to
is
of
importance
that
great
educator
profound
thinker
and
vigorous
writer
herbert
spencer
has
pertinently
said
that
as
vigorous
health
and
its
accompanying
high
spirits
are
larger
elements
of
happiness
than
any
other
things
whatever
the
teaching
how
to
maintain
them
is
a
teaching
that
yields
to
no
other
whatever
and
therefore
we
assert
that
such
a
course
of
physiology
as
is
needful
for
the
comprehension
of
its
general
truths
and
their
bearings
on
daily
conduct
is
an
part
of
a
rational
education
believing
that
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
for
the
prevention
of
disease
is
quite
as
noble
a
work
as
the
alleviation
of
physical
suffering
by
medical
skill
we
have
devoted
a
large
portion
of
this
volume
to
the
subjects
of
physiology
and
hygiene
these
we
have
endeavored
to
present
in
as
familiar
a
style
as
possible
that
they
may
be
understood
by
every
reader
freely
as
we
have
received
light
upon
these
subjects
have
we
endeavored
to
reflect
it
again
in
hopes
that
a
popular
presentation
of
these
matters
made
plain
and
easy
of
comprehension
to
all
people
may
lead
the
masses
into
greater
enjoyment
of
life
the
result
of
a
better
preservation
of
health
this
we
do
in
part
as
a
public
acknowledgment
of
our
obligations
to
society
to
whom
every
professional
man
is
a
debtor
he
belongs
to
it
is
a
part
of
its
common
stock
and
should
give
as
well
as
receive
advantages
return
as
well
as
accept
benefits
we
know
of
no
better
way
to
signify
our
appreciation
of
the
public
confidence
and
patronage
so
generously
accorded
to
us
than
to
offer
this
volume
to
the
people
at
a
price
less
than
the
actual
cost
for
an
edition
of
ordinary
size
this
we
do
as
a
token
of
the
cordial
reciprocation
of
their
good
will
in
giving
to
the
people
wholesome
advice
by
which
they
may
be
enabled
to
ward
off
disease
and
thus
preserve
the
health
of
multitudes
we
believe
we
shall
receive
their
hearty
approval
as
well
as
the
approbation
of
our
own
conscience
both
of
which
are
certainly
munificent
rewards
we
believe
that
good
deeds
are
always
rewarded
and
that
the
physician
who
prevents
sickness
manifests
a
genuine
and
earnest
devotion
to
the
common
interests
of
humanity
we
have
no
respect
for
the
motives
of
those
medical
men
who
would
withhold
that
information
from
the
people
which
will
direct
the
masses
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
thereby
prevent
much
sickness
and
suffering
nor
is
the
diffusion
of
such
knowledge
antagonistic
to
the
best
interests
of
the
true
and
competent
physician
the
necessity
for
his
invaluable
services
can
no
more
be
set
aside
by
popularizing
physiological
hygienic
and
medical
truths
than
we
can
dispense
with
those
of
the
minister
and
lawyer
by
the
inculcation
of
the
principles
of
morality
in
our
public
schools
the
common
schools
do
not
lessen
the
necessity
for
colleges
or
universities
but
rather
contribute
to
their
prosperity
nor
are
we
so
presumptuous
as
to
anticipate
that
we
could
possibly
make
this
volume
so
instructive
as
to
render
every
man
his
own
physician
no
man
can
with
advantage
be
his
own
lawyer
carpenter
tailor
and
printer
much
less
can
he
hope
to
artfully
repair
his
own
constitution
when
shattered
by
grave
maladies
which
not
only
impair
the
physical
functions
but
weaken
and
derange
the
mental
faculties
what
physician
presumes
to
prescribe
for
himself
when
suddenly
prostrated
by
serious
illness
he
very
sensibly
submits
to
the
treatment
of
another
because
he
realizes
that
sickness
impairs
his
judgment
and
morbid
sensations
mislead
and
unfit
him
for
the
exercise
of
his
skill
if
this
is
true
of
the
physician
with
how
much
greater
force
does
it
apply
to
the
unprofessional
if
a
sick
is
unfit
to
stand
at
the
helm
and
direct
his
ship
how
utterly
incompetent
must
the
raw
sailor
be
when
similarly
disqualified
nor
is
the
physician
as
competent
to
treat
those
near
and
dear
to
him
when
they
are
suffering
from
dangerous
illness
as
another
medical
man
not
similarly
situated
whose
judgment
is
not
liable
to
be
misled
by
intense
anxiety
and
affectionate
sympathy
notwithstanding
all
these
facts
however
a
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
unprofessional
of
something
more
than
physiology
and
hygiene
and
appertaining
more
closely
to
medicine
proper
will
many
times
prove
valuable
in
the
first
stage
of
many
acute
affections
which
if
unheeded
gradually
assume
a
threatening
aspect
endangering
life
and
demanding
the
services
of
the
most
skilled
physician
to
avert
fatal
results
the
early
administration
of
some
common
domestic
remedy
such
as
a
cathartic
or
a
diaphoretic
herb
associated
with
a
warm
bath
a
spirit
or
a
hot
will
very
often
obviate
the
necessity
for
calling
a
family
physician
and
frequently
save
days
and
weeks
of
sickness
and
suffering
so
likewise
are
there
numerous
acute
diseases
of
a
milder
character
which
are
easily
and
unmistakably
recognized
without
the
possession
of
great
medical
knowledge
and
which
readily
yield
to
plain
simple
medical
treatment
which
is
within
the
ready
reach
of
all
who
strive
to
acquaint
themselves
with
the
rudiments
of
medical
science
but
in
sudden
and
painful
attacks
of
acute
disease
life
may
be
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
jeopardized
and
immediate
relief
prove
necessary
while
under
these
circumstances
the
prompt
application
of
such
domestic
treatment
as
good
may
dictate
guided
by
a
knowledge
of
those
first
principles
of
medical
learning
which
we
shall
hereafter
endeavor
to
make
plain
may
result
in
speedy
and
happy
relief
yet
at
the
same
time
there
should
be
no
delay
in
summoning
a
competent
physician
to
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer
then
and
not
the
least
important
there
are
the
various
chronic
or
lingering
diseases
from
all
of
which
few
individuals
indeed
who
pass
the
meridian
of
life
entirely
escape
in
this
class
of
ailments
there
is
generally
no
immediate
danger
and
therefore
time
may
be
taken
by
the
invalid
for
studying
his
disease
and
employing
those
remedies
which
are
best
suited
for
its
removal
or
if
of
a
dangerous
or
complicated
character
and
therefore
not
so
readily
understood
he
may
consult
either
personally
or
by
letter
some
learned
and
physician
who
makes
a
specialty
of
the
treatment
of
such
cases
and
whose
large
experience
enables
him
to
excel
therein
in
consideration
therefore
of
the
foregoing
facts
we
deem
it
most
profitable
for
our
readers
that
part
fourth
of
this
volume
should
be
arranged
in
the
following
manner
the
milder
forms
of
uncomplicated
acute
diseases
which
may
be
readily
and
unmistakably
recognized
and
successfully
managed
without
professional
aid
will
receive
that
attention
which
is
necessary
to
give
the
reader
a
correct
idea
of
them
and
their
proper
remedial
treatment
we
shall
devote
only
such
attention
to
the
severe
and
hazardous
forms
of
acute
diseases
as
is
necessary
in
order
to
consider
their
initial
stage
with
their
proper
treatment
not
attempting
to
trace
their
numerous
complications
or
portray
the
many
pathological
conditions
which
are
liable
to
be
developed
for
even
by
devoting
much
space
to
the
latter
we
could
not
expect
to
qualify
our
unprofessional
readers
for
successfully
treating
such
obscure
and
dangerous
conditions
we
shall
devote
the
largest
amount
of
space
to
a
careful
and
thorough
consideration
of
those
chronic
diseases
which
by
a
little
study
may
be
readily
recognized
and
understood
by
the
masses
and
for
the
cure
of
which
we
shall
suggest
such
hygienic
treatment
and
domestic
remedies
as
may
be
safely
employed
by
all
who
are
in
quest
of
relief
in
the
more
dangerous
obscure
or
complicated
forms
of
chronic
diseases
the
correct
diagnosis
and
successful
treatment
of
which
tax
all
the
skill
possessed
by
the
experienced
specialist
the
invalid
will
not
be
misled
into
the
dangerous
policy
of
relying
upon
his
own
judgment
and
treatment
but
will
be
counseled
not
to
postpone
until
too
late
the
employment
of
a
skillful
physician
the
apportionment
of
space
which
is
made
in
considering
the
various
diseases
and
their
different
stages
as
well
as
the
course
which
the
people
are
advised
to
pursue
under
the
different
circumstances
of
affliction
is
not
always
in
accordance
with
the
plans
and
recommendations
which
have
been
made
by
others
who
have
written
works
on
domestic
medicine
most
of
these
authors
have
attempted
by
lengthy
disquisitions
to
teach
their
readers
how
to
treat
themselves
without
the
services
of
a
physician
even
in
the
most
hazardous
forms
of
disease
in
such
dangerous
maladies
as
typhoid
typhus
yellow
and
scarlet
fevers
typhoid
pneumonia
and
many
others
in
which
life
is
imminently
imperiled
such
instruction
and
advice
is
decidedly
reprehensible
as
it
may
lead
to
the
most
serious
consequences
we
are
confident
therefore
that
the
manner
of
disposing
of
the
different
subjects
which
are
discussed
in
the
succeeding
chapters
and
the
course
of
action
which
is
advised
will
commend
themselves
to
our
readers
as
being
such
as
are
calculated
to
promote
and
subserve
their
best
interests

and
accomplished
physician
from

to

and
character
of

its
symptoms

diagnosis

from

of

he
must
carry
the
torch
in

himself

into

recess
the
critical
investigation
of

with
the

to
successful
practice

observing

we
can
not

trace
out

a

the
surroundings
of

if
no
one
understood
their

a
fearful

might
follow
but
if
these

are
understood

may
hang

that
they
may
be

unless
correctly
interpreted
and
a
remedial
harbor
is
sought
these
symptoms
are
of
little
practical
value
undoubtedly
the
reason
why
so
many
blunder
is
because
they
prescribe
according
to
the
apparent
symptoms
without
any
real
reference
to
the
nature
of
the
affection
they
fail
to
discover
how
far
a
symptom
points
out
the
seat
and
also

progress
of
a
disease
they
do
not
distinguish
the
relative
importance
of
the
different
symptoms

practical
purpose
of
all
science
is
to
skillfully
apply
knowledge
to
salutary
and
profitable
uses
the
patient
himself
may
carefully
note
the
indications
but
it
is
only
the
expert
physician
who
can
tell
the
import
of
each
symptom
are
within
every
one
observation
but
only
the
physician
knows
the
nature
and
value
of
we
have
read
an
anecdote
of
galen
who
was
a
distinguished
physician
in
his
day
which
illustrates
the
distinction
between
sign
and
symptom
once
when
dangerously
ill
he
overheard
two
of
his
friends
in
attendance
upon
him
recount
his
symptoms
such
as
redness
of
the
face
a
dejected
haggard
and
inflamed
appearance
etc
he
cried
out
to
them
to
adopt
every
necessary
measure
forthwith
as
he
was
threatened
with
delirium
the
two
friends
saw
the
well
enough
but
it
was
only
galen
himself
though
the
who
was
able
to
deduce
the
of
delirium
that
is
he
alone
was
able
to
translate
those
symptoms
into
signs
to
determine
the
value
of
symptoms
as
signs
of
disease
requires
close
observation
interpretation
of
symptoms
we
shall
refer
to
a
few
symptoms
which
any
unprofessional
reader
may
readily
observe
and
understand
position
of
patient
when
a
patient
is
disposed
to
lie
upon
his
back
continually
during
the
progress
of
an
acute
disease
it
is
a
sign
of
if
he
manifests
no
desire
to
change
his
position
or
can
not
do
so
and
becomes
tremulous
at
the
least
effort
it
indicates
when
this
position
is
assumed
during
the
progress
of
continued
fever
and
is
accompanied
by
involuntary
twitching
of
the
muscles
picking
of
the
then
danger
is
imminent
and
patient
is
fever
resulting
from
local
inflammation
does
not
produce
muscular
prostration
and
the
patient
seldom
or
never
assumes
the
supine
position
if
this
inflammation
is
in
the
extremities
those
parts
are
elevated
in
order
to
lessen
the
pressure
of
the
blood
which
a
dependent
position
increases
for
example
let
us
change
the
scene
and
introduce
a
patient
with
head
and
shoulders
elevated
who
prefers
to
sit
up
and
who
places
his
hands
behind
him
and
leans
back
or
leans
forward
resting
his
arms
and
head
upon
a
chair
the
next
week
he
is
worse
and
no
longer
tries
to
lie
in
bed
but
sits
up
all
the
time
note
the
anxious
expression
of
countenance
the
difficult
or
hurried
breathing
the
dry
and
hacking
cough
and
observe
that
the
least
exertion
increases
the
difficulty
of
respiration
and
causes
palpitation
of
the
heart
these
plain
symptoms
signify
thoracic
effusion
the
collection
of
water
about
the
lungs
the
countenance
displays
diagnostic
symptoms
of
disease
in
simple
acute
fevers
the
eyes
and
face
are
red
and
the
respiration
is
hurried
but
in
acute
sympathetic
fever
these
signs
are
wanting
we
can
not
forget
the
pale
sharp
contracted
and
pinched
features
of
those
patients
whose
nostrils
contract
and
expand
alternately
with
the
acts
of
respiration
how
hard
it
was
for
them
to
breathe
the
contraction
and
expansion
of
the
nostrils
indicate
active
congestion
of
the
lungs
as
a
general
rule
chronic
inflammation
of
the
stomach
duodenum
liver
and
adjacent
organs
imparts
a
gloomy
expression
to
the
countenance
at
the
same
time
the
eye
is
dull
the
skin
dusky
or
yellow
and
the
motions
are
slow
but
in
lung
diseases
the
spirits
are
buoyant
the
skin
is
fair
and
the
cheeks
flushed
with
fever
and
distinctly
circumscribed
with
white
for
delicacy
and
contrast
almost
exceed
the
hues
of
health
in
beauty
note
too
the
pearly
lustre
and
sparkling
light

plainly
told
by
the

the

corroborates
this

to
be

much
may
be
learned
from
the
appearance
color
and
form
of
the
tongue
and
the
manner
of
its
protrusion
if
pale
moist
and
coated
white
it
indicates
a
mild
febrile
condition
of
the

if
coated
in
the

and
the
sides
look
raw
it
indicates
gastric
irritation
if
red

it
is
a
sign
of
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membrane
of

usually
the

beats
four
times
during

both
in

its
frequency
may
be
accelerated
or
retarded
in
adults
there
are
from
to
beats
in
a
minute
and
yet
in
a
few
instances
we
have
found
in
health
only
forty
pulsations
per
minute
but
when
the
heart
beats
from
one
hundred
and
twenty
to
one
hundred
and
forty
times
a

there
is
reason
to
apprehend
danger
and
the
case
should
receive
the
careful
attention
of
a
physician
irregularity
of
the
pulse
may
be
caused
by
disease
of
the
brain
heart
stomach
or
liver
by
the
disordered
condition
of

the
import
of
pain
depends
on
its
seat
intensity
nature
and
duration
an
acute
intense
pain
usually
indicates
inflammation
of
a
nerve
as
well
as
the
adjacent

sharp
shooting
lancinating
pains
occur
in
inflammation
of
the
serous
tissues
as
in
pleurisy
a
smarting
stinging

attends
inflammation
of
the
mucous

acute
pain
is
generally
remittent
and
not
fixed
to
one
spot
dull
heavy
pain
is
more
persistent
and
is
present
in
congestions
or
when
the
substance
of
an
organ
is
inflamed
and
it
often
precedes
hemorrhage
burning
pain
characterizes
violent
inflammations
involving
the

is
not
first
felt
in
the

is
generally
most
severe
in

occasionally
produces
numbness
of

is
often
indicated
by
nausea
and
vomiting
before
attention
is
directed
to
the

these
illustrations
are
sufficient
to
show
that
pain
often
takes
place
in
some
part
remote
from
the

permanent
pain
shows
that
the
structures
of
an
organ
are
inflamed
while
intermittent

is
a
sign
of
neuralgia
gout
or
rheumatism
absence
of
pain
in
any
disease
where
ordinarily
it
should
be
present
is
an
unfavorable
sign
internal

after
a
favorable
crisis
is
a
bad
omen
or
if

is
bad
if
however
pain
and
fever
remit
simultaneously
and
the

continue
it
is
a
favorable
sign
a
dull
pain
in
the
head
indicates
fullness
of
the

general
debility
it
may
be
caused
by

it
may
proceed
from
gastric
disturbance
constipation
of

sometimes
precedes
inflammation
of
the

a
dull
oppressive
pain
in
the
head
indicates
softening
of
the

and
is
generally
accompanied
by
slowness
of
the

a
pulsating
pain
of
the

occurs
in
heart
disease
hysteria
and
frequently
accompanies
some
forms
of
insanity
the
eye
indicates
morbid
changes
and
furnishes
unmistakable
signs
of

sinking
of
the
eye
indicates
waste
as
in
consumption
diarrhea
and

in
fevers
it
is
regarded
as
a
fatal
symptom
a
dark
or
leaden
circle
around
the
eye
seen
after
hard
work
indicates
fatigue
and
overdoing
if
the
mucous
covering
of
the
inner
surface
of
the
lids
and
the
ball
of
the
eye
is
congested
and

observed
in
catarrhal
consumption
congestion
of

also
in

diseases
the
lustre
of
the

increases
as
in

but
if
it
decreases
with
the

it
indicates
great
debility

examination
of
the
urine
all
medical
authors
and
physicians
of
education
freely
admit
and
even
insist
upon
the
importance
of
critically
examining
the
patient
urine
in
all
cases
in
which
there
is
reason
to
suspect
disease
of
the
kidneys
or
bladder
in
chronic
affections
it
is
particularly
serviceable
especially
in
derangements
of
the
liver
blood
kidneys
bladder
prostate
gland
and
nervous
system
many
scholarly
physicians
have
sadly
neglected
the
proper
inspection
of
the
urine
because
they
were
afraid
of
being
classed
with
the
illiterate
uroscopian
doctors
or
fanatical
enthusiasts
who
ignorantly
pretend
to
diagnose
correctly
diseases
in
this
manner
thus
subjecting
themselves
and
their
claims
to
ridicule
nothing
should
deter
one
from
giving
to
this
excretion
the
attention
it
deserves
the
urine
which
is
voided
when
the
system
is
deranged
or
diseased
is
altered
in
its
color
and
composition
showing
that
its
ingredients
vary
greatly
so
important
an
aid
do
examinations
of
the
urine
furnish
in
diagnosing
many
chronic
ailments
that
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
where
many
thousands
of
cases
are
annually
treated
a
chemical
laboratory
has
been
fitted
up
and
a
skillful
chemist
is
employed
who
makes
a
specialty
of
examining
the
urine
both
chemically
and
microscopically
and
reporting
the
result
to
the
attending
physicians
his
extended
experience
renders
his
services
invaluable
with
his
assistance
maladies
which
had
hitherto
baffled
all
efforts
put
forth
to
determine
their
true
character
have
frequently
been
quickly
and
unmistakably
disclosed
microscopical
examination
this
method
of
examination
affords
a
quicker
and
more
correct
idea
of
a
deposit
or
deposits
than
any
other
method
the
expert
by
simply
looking
at
a
specimen
can
determine
the
character
of
the
urine
whether
blood
mucus
pus
uric
acid
are
present
or
not
but
when
no
deposit
is
present
then
it
is
necessary
to
apply
chemical
tests
and
in
many
cases
the
quantity
of
the
suspected
ingredient
must
be
determined
by
analysis
as
a
detailed
account
of
the
various
modifications
which
the
urine
undergoes
in
different
diseases
would
be
of
no
practical
use
to
the
masses
since
they
could
not
avail
themselves
of
the
advantages
which
it
would
afford
for
correct
diagnosis
except
by
the
employment
of
a
physician
who
does
not
ignore
this
aid
in
examining
his
patients
we
shall
omit
all
further
details
upon
the
subject
for
the
same
reason
we
shall
not
often
in
treating
of
the
different
diseases
in
which
examinations
of
the
urine
furnish
such
valuable
aid
in
forming
a
diagnosis
make
mention
of
the
changes
which
are
likely
to
have
occurred
inflammation
the
term
signifies
a
state
in
which
the
infected
part
is
hotter
redder
more
congested
and
more
painful
than
is
natural
inflammation
is
limited
to
certain
parts
while
fever
influences
the
system
generally
inflammation
gives
rise
to
new
formations
morbid
products
and
lesions
or
alterations
of
structure
the
morbid
products
of
fever
and
its
modification
of
fluids
are
carried
away
by
the
secretions
and
excretions
the
susceptibility
of
the
body
to
inflammation
maybe
or
it
is
natural
when
it
is
constitutional
that
is
when
there
is
an
original
tendency
of
the
animal
economy
to
manifest
itself
in
some
form
of
inflammation
we
may
notice
that
some
children
are
far
more
subject
to
boils
croups
and
erysipelatous
diseases
than
others
this
susceptibility
when
innate
may
be
lessened
by
careful
medication
although
it
may
never
be
wholly
eradicated
when
acquired
it
is
the
result
of
the
influence
of
habits
of
life
climate
and
the
state
of
mind
over
the
constitution
phlegmonous
inflammation
is
the
active
inflammation
of
the
cellular
membrane
one
illustration
of
which
is
a
common
boil
the
four
principal
symptoms
are
redness
swelling
heat
and
pain
and
then
appears
a
conical
hard
circumscribed
tumor
having
its
seat
in
the
dermoid
texture
at
the
end
of
an
indefinite
period
it
becomes
pointed
white
or
yellow
and
discharges
pus
mixed
with
blood
when
it
breaks
a
small
grayish
fibrous
mass
sometimes
appears
which
consists
of
dead
cellular
tissue
and
which
is
called
the
there
are
certain
morbid
states
of
the
constitution
which
lead
to
local
inflammation
subsequent
upon
slight
injury
or
in
some
cases
without
any
such
provocation
as
in
gout
rheumatism
and
scrofula
one
of
the
first
results
of
the
inflammation
in
such
cases
is
a
weakening
of
the
forces
which
distribute
the
blood
to
the
surface
and
extremities
of
the
body
it
is
generally
admitted
that
in
scrofulous
persons
the
vascular
system
is
weak
the
vessels
are
small
and
because
nutrition
is
faulty
the
blood
is
the
result
is
failure
in
the
system
for
if
nutrition
fails
there
may
be
lacking
earthy
matter
for
the
bones
or
the
unctious
secretions
of
the
skin
the
sebaceous
secretion
is
albuminous
and
liable
to
become
dry
producing
inflammation
of
the
parts
which
it
ought
to
protect
disorder
of
the
alimentary
canal
and
other
mucous
surfaces
are
sometimes
reflected
upon
the
skin
we
have
occasionally
observed
cutaneous
eruptions
and
erysipelas
when
evidently
they
were
distinct
signs
of
internal
disorder
inflammation
may
be
internal
as
well
as
external
as
inflammation
of
the
brain
lungs
or
stomach
and
it
is
frequently
the
result
of
what
is
called
a
no
matter
how
the
body
is
chilled
the
blood
retreats
from
the
surface
which
becomes
pale
and
shrunken
there
is
also
nervous
uneasiness
and
frequently
a
rigor
accompanied
with
chattering
of
the
teeth
after
the
cold
stage
reaction
takes
place
and
fever
follows
the
sudden
change
from
a
dry
and
heated
room
to
a
cool
and
moist
atmosphere
is
liable
to
induce
a
cold
riding
in
a
carriage
until
the
body
is
shivering
or
sitting
in
a
draft
of
air
when
one
has
been
previously
heated
or
breathing
a
very
cold
air
during
the
night
when
the
body
is
warm
especially
when
not
accustomed
to
doing
so
or
exposing
the
body
to
a
low
temperature
when
insufficiently
clothed
are
all
different
ways
of
producing
inflammation
inflammation
may
result
in
consequence
of
local
injury
caused
by
a
bruise
or
by
a
sharp
cutting
instrument
as
a
knife
or
an
axe
or
it
may
be
caused
by
the
puncture
of
a
pin
blade
or
a
or
from
a
lacerated
wound
as
from
the
bite
of
a
dog
or
from
a
very
minute
wound
poisoned
by
the
bite
of
a
venomous
reptile
local
inflammations
may
arise
from
scalds
burns
the
application
of
caustics
arsenic
corrosive
sublimate
cantharides
powerful
acids
abrasions
of
the
surface
by
injuries
and
from
the
occurrence
of
accidents
the
of
the
part
may
be
caused
by
an
increase
of
the
quantity
of
blood
in
the
vessels
the
effusion
of
serum
and
coagulating
lymph
and
the
interruption
of
absorption
by
the
injury
or
by
the
altered
condition
of
the
inflamed
part
the
character
of
the
depends
upon
the
tissue
involved
and
upon
the
altered
or
unnatural
state
of
the
nerves
ordinarily
tendon
ligament
cartilage
and
bone
are
not
very
sensitive
but
when
inflamed
they
are
exquisitely
so
the
heat
of
the
inflamed
part
is
not
so
great
when
measured
by
the
thermometer
as
might
be
supposed
from
the
patient
sensations
termination
of
inflammation
inflammation
ends
in
one
of
six
different
ways
inflammation
may
terminate
in
spontaneous
recovery
by
in
the
formation
of
matter
by
as
the
inflammation
caused
by
a
terminates
by
effusion
of
water
by
the
part
inflamed
forming
an
attachment
to
some
other
part
by
hardening
of
the
organ
or
by
that
is
death
of
the
part
thus
inflammation
of
the
lungs
may
terminate
by
recovery
that
is
by
resolution
by
suppuration
and
raising
of
matter
by
hardening
and
solidification
of
the
lung
or
by
gangrene
inflammation
of
the
endocardium
the
lining
membrane
of
the
heart
may
cause
a
thickening
of
it
and
ossification
of
the
valves
of
the
heart
thus
impairing
its
function
inflammation
of
the
pericardium
may
terminate
in
effusion
or
dropsy
and
inflammation
of
the
liver
may
result
in
hardening
and
adhesion
to
adjacent
parts
several
principles
for
treatment
of
inflammation
remove
the
exciting
causes
as
far
as
practicable
if
caused
by
a
splinter
or
any
foreign
substance
it
should
be
withdrawn
and
if
the
injury
is
merely
local
apply
cold
water
to
the
parts
to
subdue
the
inflammation
if
caused
by
a
rabid
animal
the
wound
should
be
enlarged
and
cupped
and
the
parts
cleansed
or
destroyed
by
caustic
the
patient
should
remain
quiet
and
not
be
disturbed
the
use
of
tincture
of
aconite
internally
will
be
found
excellent
to
prevent
the
rise
of
inflammation
a
purgative
is
also
advised
and
four
or
five
of
pierce
pleasant
purgative
pellets
will
be
sufficient
to
act
upon
the
bowels
if
there
is
pain
an
anodyne
and
diaphoretic
is
proper
pierce
compound
extract
of
will
fulfill
this
indication
in
local
inflammation
cold
water
is
a
good
remedy
yet
sometimes
hot
water
or
cloths
wrung
out
of
it
will
be
found
to
be
the
appropriate
application
when
the
inflammation
is
located
in
an
organ
within
a
cavity
as
the
lungs
hot
fomentations
will
be
of
great
service
bathing
the
surface
with
alkaline
water
must
not
be
omitted
whenever
the
inflammation
is
serious
the
family
physician
should
be
early
summoned
fever
in
fever
all
the
functions
are
more
or
less
deranged
in
every
considerable
inflammation
there
is
sympathetic
fever
but
in
essential
fevers
there
are
generally
fewer
lesions
of
structure
than
in
inflammation
fever
occasions
great
waste
of
the
tissues
of
the
body
and
the
refuse
matter
is
carried
away
by
the
organs
of
secretion
and
excretion
the
heat
of
the
body
in
fever
is
generally
diffused
the
pulse
is
quicker
there
is
dullness
lassitude
chilliness
and
disinclination
to
take
food
we
propose
to
give
only
a
general
outline
of
fevers
enough
to
indicate
the
principles
which
should
be
observed
in
domestic
treatment
most
fevers
are
distinctly
marked
by
four
stages
the
forming
stage
the
cold
stage
the
hot
stage
the
sweating
or
declining
stage
during
the
first
stage
the
individual
is
hardly
conscious
of
being
ill
for
the
attack
is
so
slight
that
it
is
hardly
perceptible
true
as
it
progresses
there
is
a
feeling
of
languor
an
indisposition
to
make
any
bodily
or
mental
effort
and
also
a
sense
of
soreness
of
the
muscles
aching
of
the
bones
chilliness
and
a
disposition
to
get
near
the
fire
there
is
restlessness
disturbed
sleep
bad
dreams
lowness
of
spirits
all
of
which
are
characteristic
of
the
formative
stage
of
fever
the
next
is
the
cold
stage
when
there
is
a
decided
manifestation
of
the
disease
and
the
patient
acknowledges
that
he
is
really
sick
in
typhus
and
typhoid
fever
the
chills
are
slight
in
other
fevers
they
are
more
marked
while
in
ague
they
are
often
accompanied
by
uncontrollable
shaking
when
the
chill
is
not
so
distinct
the
nails
look
blue
and
the
skin
appears
shriveled
the
eye
is
sunken
and
a
dark
circle
circumscribes
it
the
lips
are
blue
and
there
is
pain
in
the
back
the
pulse
is
frequent
small
and
depressed
the
capillary
circulation
feeble
the
respiration
increased
and
there
may
be
nausea
and
vomiting
these
symptoms
vary
in
duration
from
a
few
minutes
to
more
than
an
hour
they
gradually
abate
reaction
takes
place
and
the
patient
begins
to
throw
off
the
then
follows
the
hot
stage
for
with
the
return
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
to
the
surface
of
the
body
there
is
greater
warmth
freer
breathing
and
a
more
comfortable
and
quiet
condition
of
the
system
the
veins
fill
with
blood
the
countenance
brightens
the
cheeks
are
flushed
the
intellect
is
more
sprightly
and
if
the
pulse
is
frequent
it
is
a
good
sign
if
it
sinks
it
indicates
feeble
vital
force
and
is
not
a
good
symptom
if
there
is
considerable
determination
of
blood
to
the
head
it
becomes
hot
the
arteries
of
the
neck
pulsate
strongly
and
delirium
may
be
expected
during
the
hot
stage
if
the
fever
runs
high
the
patient
becomes
restless
frequently
changes
his
position
is
wakeful
uneasy
and
complains
of
pain
in
his
limbs
in
low
grades
the
sensibility
is
blunted
smell
taste
and
hearing
are
impaired
the
patient
in
the
hot
stage
is
generally
thirsty
and
if
he
is
allowed
to
drink
much
it
may
result
in
nausea
and
vomiting
moderate
indulgence
in
water
however
is
permissible
there
is
aversion
to
food
and
if
any
is
eaten
it
remains
undigested
the
teeth
are
sometimes
covered
with
dark
foul
accumulations
early
in
the
fever
and
the
appearance
of
the
tongue
varies
sometimes
being
coated
a
yellowish
brown
sometimes
red
and
dry
at
other
times
thickly
coated
and
white
the
condition
of
the
bowels
varies
from
constipation
to
diarrhea
although
sometimes
they
are
quite
regular
the
urine
is
generally
diminished
in
quantity
but
shows
higher
color
the
sweating
stage
in
some
fevers
is
very
marked
while
in
others
there
is
very
little
moisture
but
an
evident
decline
of
the
hot
stage
the
skin
becoming
more
natural
and
soft
the
pulse
is
more
compressible
and
less
frequent
the
kidneys
act
freely
respiration
is
natural
the
pains
subside
although
there
remains
languor
lassitude
and
weariness
a
preternatural
sensibility
to
cold
an
easily
excited
pulse
and
a
pale
and
sickly
aspect
of
the
countenance
the
appetite
has
failed
and
the
powers
of
digestion
are
still
impaired
domestic
management
of
fevers
it
is
proper
to
make
a
thorough
study
of
the
early
insidious
symptoms
of
fever
in
order
to
understand
what
ought
to
be
done
if
it
arises
in
consequence
of
malaria
the
treatment
must
be
suited
to
the
case
if
from
irritation
of
the
bowels
and
improper
articles
of
diet
then
a
mild
cathartic
is
required
if
there
is
much
inflammation
a
severe
chill
and
strong
reaction
then
the
treatment
should
be
active
if
the
fever
is
of
the
congestive
variety
and
the
constitution
is
feeble
the
reaction
imperfect
a
small
weak
pulse
a
tendency
to
fainting
a
pale
countenance
and
great
pain
in
the
head
apply
heat
and
administer
diaphoretics
and
procure
the
services
of
a
good
physician
as
a
general
rule
it
is
proper
to
administer
a
cathartic
unless
in
typhoid
fever
and
for
this
pierce
purgative
pellets
answer
the
purpose
given
in
doses
of
from
four
to
six
according
to
the
state
of
the
bowels
if
these
are
not
at
hand
a
tea
of
sage
and
senna
may
be
drunk
until
it
produces
a
purgative
effect
or
a
dose
of
rochelle
salts
taken
in
nearly
all
fevers
we
have
found
that
a
weak
alkaline
tea
made
from
the
white
ashes
of
hickory
or
maple
wood
is
useful
taken
weak
three
or
four
times
daily
or
if
there
be
considerable
thirst
more
frequently
some
patients
desire
lemon
juice
which
enters
the
system
as
an
alkali
and
answers
all
purposes
diaphoretic
medicines
are
also
indicated
and
the
use
of
extract
of
will
prove
very
serviceable
drinking
freely
of
tea
or
of
a
strong
decoction
of
boneset
is
frequently
useful
after
free
sweating
has
been
established
then
it
is
proper
to
follow
by
the
use
of
diuretic
teas
such
as
that
of
spearmint
and
pumpkin
seed
combined
or
sweet
spirits
of
nitre
in
doses
of
twenty
to
thirty
drops
added
to
a
teaspoonful
of
the
extract
of
diluted
with
sweetened
water
to
lessen
the
frequency
of
the
pulse
fluid
extract
or
tincture
of
aconite
or
veratrum
may
be
given
in
water
every
hour
during
the
intermission
of
symptoms
tonic
medicines
and
a
sustaining
course
of
treatment
should
be
employed
if
the
tongue
is
loaded
and
the
evacuations
from
the
bowels
are
fetid
a
solution
of
sulphite
of
soda
is
proper
or
take
equal
parts
of
brewer
yeast
and
water
mix
and
when
the
yeast
settles
give
a
tablespoonful
of
the
water
every
hour
as
an
antiseptic
administering
a
warm
alkaline
to
a
fever
patient
every
day
is
an
excellent
febrifuge
remedy
being
careful
not
to
chill
or
induce
fatigue
if
there
is
pain
in
the
head
apply
mustard
to
the
feet
if
it
is
in
the
side
apply
hot
fomentations
the
symptoms
which
indicate
danger
are
a
tumid
and
hard
abdomen
difficult
breathing
offensive
and
profuse
diarrhea
bloody
urine
delirium
or
insensibility
favorable
symptoms
are
a
natural
and
soft
state
of
the
skin
eruptions
on
the
surface
a
natural
expression
of
the
countenance
moist
tongue
free
action
of
the
kidneys
and
regular
sleep
if
the
domestic
treatment
which
we
have
advised
does
not
break
the
force
of
the
disease
and
mitigate
the
urgency
of
the
symptoms
it
will
be
safer
to
employ
a
good
physician
who
will
prescribe
such
a
coarse
of
treatment
as
the
case
specially
requires
it
is
our
aim
to
indicate
what
may
be
done
before
the
physician
is
called
for
frequently
his
services
can
not
be
obtained
when
they
are
most
needed
besides
if
these
attacks
are
early
and
properly
treated
with
domestic
remedies
it
will
often
obviate
the
necessity
of
calling
upon
a
physician
if
on
the
other
hand
fevers
are
neglected
and
no
treatment
instituted
they
become
more
serious
in
character
and
are
more
difficult
to
cure
to
recapitulate
our
treatment
recommends
evacuation
through
outlets
the
skin
kidneys
and
bowels
maintaining
warmth
neutralizing
acidity
using
antiseptics
tonics
and
the
and
the
fluid
extract
or
tincture
of
aconite
or
veratrum
to
moderate
the
pulse
by
controlling
the
accelerated
and
unequal
circulation
of
the
blood
it
is
a
simple
treatment
but
if
judiciously
followed
it
will
often
abort
a
fever
or
materially
modify
its
intensity
and
shorten
its
course
fever
and
ague
intermittent
fever
the
description
of
fever
already
given
applies
well
to
this
form
of
it
only
the
symptoms
in
the
former
stage
are
rather
more
distinct
than
in
the
other
varieties
weariness
lassitude
yawning
and
stretching
a
bitter
taste
in
the
mouth
nausea
less
of
appetite
the
uneasy
state
of
the
stomach
and
bowels
are
more
marked
in
the
premonitory
stages
of
intermittent
fevers
the
cold
stage
commences
with
a
chilliness
of
the
extremities
and
back
the
skin
looks
pale
and
shriveled
the
blood
recedes
from
the
surface
respiration
is
hurried
the
urine
is
limpid
and
pale
sometimes
there
is
nausea
and
vomiting
and
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
stage
the
chilly
sensations
are
varied
with
flushes
of
heat
the
hot
stage
is
distinguished
by
the
heat
and
dryness
of
the
surface
of
the
body
and
the
redness
of
the
face
there
is
great
thirst
strong
full
and
hard
pulse
free
and
hurried

and
increased
pain
in
the

and
back
the
sweating
stage
commences
by
perspiration
appearing
upon
the
forehead
which
slowly
extends
over
the
whole
body
and
soon
there
is
an
evident
intermission
of
all
the
symptoms
in
the
inflammatory
variety
of
intermittent
fever
all
these
symptoms
are
acute

and
characterized
by

the
most
frequent

treatment
during
the
entire
paroxysm
the
patient
should
be
kept
in

and
in
the
cold
stage
covered
with
blankets
and
surrounded
with
bottles
of

be
administered
in
some
diaphoretic
during
the
hot

the
extra
clothing
and
the
bottles
of
hot
water
should
be
gradually
removed
and
cold
drinks
taken
instead
of
warm
during
the
sweating
stage
the
patient
should
be
left
alone
but
as
soon
as
the
perspiration
ceases
from
two
to
four
of
the
purgative
pellets
should
be
administered
as
a
gentle
cathartic
a
second
paroxysm
should
if
possible
be
prevented
to
accomplish
this
during
the
intermission

taken
in

three
teaspoonfuls
every

with
doses
of
the
sulphate
of
quinine
if
the

should
be
summoned
to
attend

there
is
a
complete
intermission
of
the

pernicious
fever
this
is
the
most
severe
and
dangerous
form
of
malarial
fever
it
may
be
either
intermittent
or
remittent
in
character
in
some
instances
the
first
paroxysm
is
so
violent
as
to
destroy
life
in
a
few
hours
while
in
others
it
comes
on
insidiously

treatment
this
fever
is
so
dangerous
that
a
physician
should
be
summoned
as
soon
as
the
disease
is
recognized
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
unable
to
obtain
medical
attendance
we
will
say
that
the
treatment
should
be
much
the
same
as
in
intermittent
fever
but
more
energetic
quinine
should
be
taken
in
doses
of
from
five
to
fifteen
grains
every
two
or
three
hours
if
it

but
without
any
marked
variation
for
a
certain
period
they
are
usually
characterized
by
great
prostration
of

and
are
called
when
they
manifest
septic
changes
in
the

and
when
they
speedily
run
to
a

termination
and
fevers
belong
to
this
class
we
shall
not
advise
treatment
for
these
more
grave
disorders
which
should
always
for
the
safety
of
the
patient
be
attended
by
the

except
to
recommend
some
simple
means
which
may
be
employed
in

typhoid
fever
enteric
fever
in
typhoid
fever
there
is
ulceration
of
the
intestines
and
mesenteric
glands
this
diseased
condition
of
the
bowels
distinguishes
this
fever
from
all
others
and
is
readily
detected
by
sensitiveness
to
pressure
especially
over
the
lower
part
of
the

developed
from
the
action
of
a
specific
germ
upon
a
susceptible
system
the
poison
of
typhoid
fever
is
eliminated
mainly
through
the
bowels
the
germs
of
typhoid
can
maintain
life
for
months
in
water
and
thus
it
happens
that
ponds
lakes
rivers
and
streams
which

can
spread
the

fever
well
water
often

experience
has
proved

treatment
should
be
directed
by
an
experienced

should
be
thoroughly
disinfected
with

scarlet
fever
scarlatina
this
fever
takes
its
name
from
the
scarlet
color
of
the
eruption
on
the
surface
of
the
body
sometimes
it
is
comparatively
mild
and
is
then
called
when
it
is
accompanied
by
a
sore
throat
it
is
termed
and
when
the
disease
is
of
a
low
putrid
type
it
is
called
this
disease
has
three
distinct
stages
the
stage
of
invasion
the
stage
of
eruption
and
the
stage
of
desquamation
in
the
first
stage
there
is
pain
in
the
head
increased
heat
of
the
skin
redness
and
soreness
of
the
throat
and
sometimes
nosebleed
diarrhea
or
vomiting
the
average
duration
of
this
stage
is
hours
the
eruptive
stage
generally
begins
on
the
second
day
though
sometimes
it
is
delayed
longer
and
the
scarlet
rash
rapidly
diffuses
itself
over
the
whole

the
redness
is
vivid
and
has
been
compared
to
the
appearance
of
a
boiled
lobster
the
stage
of
eruption
reaches
its
maximum
of
intensity
on
the
third
day
and
it
is
important
that
it
does
not
recede
redness
of
the
tonsils
and
throat
is
one
of
the
early
symptoms
which
precedes
any
cutaneous
eruption
the
tongue
also
is
finely
spotted
with
numerous
red
points
which
mark
its
papillae
presenting
an
appearance
which
has
been
compared
to
that
of
a
strawberry
the
thirst
is
urgent
there
is
no
appetite
and
vomiting
and
mild
delirium
are
common
this
stage
continues
from
four
to
six
days
and
sometimes
longer
desquamation
scaling
off
of
the
skin
commences
at
the
decline
of
the
eruption
in
the
form
of
minute
branny
scales
the
duration
of
this
stage
is
indefinite
and
may
end
in
five
or
six
or
may
continue
ten
or
twelve
days
if
the
inflammation
in
the
throat
is
very
severe
it
may
terminate
in
an
abscess
which
may
also
occur
in
the
glands
of
the
neck
and
sometimes
the
inflammation
extends
to
the
lips
cheeks
and
eyelids
gangrene
within
the
throat
occurs
in
rare
instances
the
disease
is
easily
communicated
and
usually
develops
in
two
to
five
days
after
exposure
it
occurs
most
frequently
in
the
third
and
fourth
years
of
life
there
is
no
other
disease
so
simple
and
yet
so
often
liable
to
prove
fatal
as
scarlet
fever
and
for
this
reason
we
shall
advise
the
attendance
of
the
family
physician
domestic
treatment
may
be
given
as
follows
until
a
physician
can
be
obtained
catnip
pennyroyal
or
tea
containing
one
teaspoonful
of
the
extract
of
may
be
given
to
drive
the
rash
to
the
surface
cold
drinks
are
suitable
to
allay
the
thirst
nausea
and
fever
the
should
be
kept
at
a
temperature
of
about
and
fresh
air
admitted
freely
the
patient
ought
not
to
be
overloaded
with
and
the
skin
should
be
sponged
over
twice
daily
with
tepid
water
different
parts
being
exposed
successively
and
carefully
dried
with
soft
cloths
soda
may
be
added
to
the
water
but
no
soap
should
be
used
the
diet
should
consist
of
milk
extract
of
beef
and
soups
injections
may
be
employed
to
relieve
constipation
but
purgatives
should
be
avoided
we
repeat
that
this
disease
is
one
which
requires
the
attendance
of
the
family
physician
and
great
care
should
be
exercised
during
recovery
that
no
bad
results
may
follow
variola
is
produced
by
a
specific
poison
which
is
reproduced
and
multiplied
during
the
progress
of
the
disease
it
is
contained
in
the
pustules
and
in
the
excretions
and
exhalations
of
affected
individuals
it
is
established
after
a
period
of
incubation
varying
from
nine
to
thirteen
days
after
infection
there
are
two
varieties
of
this
disease
known
as
and
variola
in
the
former
the
vesicles
run
together
in
the
latter
they
are
separate
this
fever
has
three
stages
the
first
is
that
of
distinctly
marked
by
a
chill
or
a
series
of
chills
which
alternate
with
flushes
of
heat
in
this
stage
the
tongue
becomes
coated
there
is
also
nausea
and
vomiting
pain
in
the
limbs
back
and
particularly
in
the
loins
the
latter
symptom
being
of
diagnostic
importance
this
stage
continues
about
two
days
and
if
the
symptoms
are
light
it
may
be
expected
that
the
disease
will
be
comparatively
mild
and
of
the
variety
stage
of
the
eruption
begins
to
appear
on
the
skin
generally
on
the
third
day
following
the
attack
though
in
the
throat
and
mouth
may
be
discovered
round
whitish
or
ashy
spots
several
hours
previous
to
the
appearance
of
vesicles
on
the
surface
of
the
body
these
are
first
seen
on
the
face
and
neck
then
on
the
trunk
and
upper
extremities
and
lastly
on
the
lower
extremities
the
eruption
at
first
appears
in
the
form
of
small
red
or
purple
spots
which
change
the
texture
of
the
skin
by
becoming
more
hard
pointed
and
elevated
on
the
fifth
day
of
the
eruption
they
attain
their
full
size
being
softened
and
depressed
in
the
center
and
hence
are
called
now
a
change
takes
place
and
the
vesicles
fill
with
matter
and
become
pointed
and
there
is
a
rise
in
the
fever
stage
of
commences
thus
the
pulse
quickens
the
skin
becomes
hotter
and
in
many
cases
of
the
confluent
variety
swelling
of
the
face
eyelids
and
extremities
occurs
frequently
there
is
passive
delirium
in
this
stage
and
if
diarrhea
sets
in
it
is
an
unfavorable
sign
the
duration
of
this
stage
of
the
eruption
is
four
or
five
days
stage
of
or
of
the
drying
of
the
pustules
commences
between
the
twelfth
and
fourteenth
day
of
the
disease
in
the
confluent
variety
patches
of
scab
cover
all
the
space
occupied
by
the
eruption
and
the
skin
exhales
a
sickening
odor
the
treatment
should
have
reference
to
the
determination
of
the
eruption
to
the
surface
if
there
is
thirst
allow
cold
drinks
or
lemonade
bathing
the
surface
with
cold
water
breathing
plenty
of
fresh
air
using
disinfectants
in
the
room
and
taking
antiseptic
medicine
internally
are
proper
add
one
part
of
carbolic
acid
to
six
parts
of
glycerine
mix
from
two
to
three
drops
of
this
with
an
ounce
of
water
and
of
this
preparation
administer
teaspoonful
doses
frequently
a
few
drops
of
carbolic
acid
and
glycerine
may
be
rubbed
up
with
vaseline
and
the
surface
anointed
with
it
to
prevent
pitting
the
malady
is
so
grave
that
it
should
be
intrusted
to
the
care
of
the
family
physician
varioloid
modified
varioloid
is
a
modified
form
of
there
is
less
constitutional
disturbance
and
very
little
or
no
pitting
of
the
skin
varioloid
generally
occurs
in
persons
who
have
not
been
fully
protected
by
vaccination
a
person
suffering
from
this
modification
of
the
disease
may
by
contagion
communicate
to
another
genuine
the
is
the
same
as
that
recommended
in
variola
vaccinia
the
important
discovery
of
vaccination
is
due
to
jenner
who
ascertained
that
when
the
cow
was
affected
by
this
disease
and
it
was
then
communicated
to
man
the
affection
was
rendered
very
mild
and
devoid
of
danger
and
at
the
same
time
it
proved
a
very
complete
protection
against
like
most
other
valuable
discoveries
introduced
to
the
world
it
encountered
bitter
prejudice
and
the
most
unfair
opposition
now
its
inestimable
value
is
generally
known
and
admitted
in
a
few
cases
in
which
the
quality
of
the
vaccine
virus
was
deteriorated
its
effect
is
only
to
and
then
the
disease
resembles
that
caused
by
inoculation
the
operation
of
infecting
the
blood
with
the
is
called
all
that
we
know
is
that
when
the
cow
becomes
affected
with
this
disease
and
it
is
then
transferred
to
man
it
loses
its
severity
and
serves
as
a
protection
against
in
a
great
majority
of
cases
this
protection
is
absolute
and
only
in
a
very
few
does
it
leave
the
subject
susceptible
to
materially
modified
the
protection
it
affords
against
is
found
to
diminish
after
the
lapse
of
an
indefinite
number
of
years
and
hence
it
is
important
to
be
once
or
twice
for
instance
after
an
interval
of
five
years
between
the
second
and
third
months
of
infancy
is
the
best
period
for
vaccination
and
the
place
usually
selected
is
the
middle
of
the
arm
above
the
varicella
is
an
eruptive
disease
which
affects
children
and
occasionally
adults
it
is
attended
with
only
slight
constitutional
disturbance
and
is
therefore
neither
a
distressing
nor
dangerous
affection
the
eruption
first
appears
on
the
body
afterwards
on
the
neck
the
scalp
and
lastly
on
the
face
it
appears
on
the
second
or
third
day
after
the
attack
and
is
succeeded
by
vesicles
containing
a
transparent
fluid
these
begin
to
dry
on
the
fifth
sixth
or
seventh
day
this
disease
may
be
distinguished
from
variola
and
varioloid
by
the
shortness
of
the
period
of
invasion
the
mildness
of
the
symptoms
and
the
absence
of
the
deep
depression
of
the
vesicles
so
noticeable
in
variola
treatment
ordinarily
very
little
treatment
is
required
it
is
best
to
use
daily
an
alkaline
bath
and
as
a
drink
the
tea
of
catnip
or
other
diaphoretics
to
which
may
be
added
from
to
one
teaspoonful
of
the
extract
of
if
the
fever
runs
high
a
few
drops
of
aconite
in
water
will
control
it
measles
rubeola
this
is
generally
a
disease
of
less
severity
and
importance
than
the
other
eruptive
fevers
but
it
is
sometimes
followed
by
serious
complications
the
stage
of
invasion
is
marked
by
the
symptoms
of
a
common
cold
sneezing
watery
eyes
a
discharge
from
the
nostrils
a
dry
cough
chilliness
and
headache
this
stage
may
last
four
days
then
follows
an
eruption
of
red
dots
or
specks
which
momentarily
disappear
on
pressure
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
eruption
the
redness
of
the
skin
fades
the
fever
diminishes
and
the
vesicles
dry
into
scales
or
little
flakes
the
eyes
may
be
inflamed
and
the
bowels
may
be
quite
lax
at
this
stage
treatment
the
great
object
in
the
treatment
is
to
bring
out
the
eruption
to
effect
this
sweating
teas
are
beneficial
the
free
use
of
the
extract
of
is
recommended
and
the
skin
should
be
bathed
every
day
with
tepid
water
sometimes
when
warm
drinks
fail
to
bring
out
the
eruption
drinking
freely
of
cold
water
and
keeping
warmly
covered
in
bed
will
accomplish
the
desired
result
false
measles
is
an
affection
of
very
little
importance
and
may
be
treated
similarly
to
a
case
of
ordinary
measles
erysipelas
there
are
few
adult
persons
in
this
country
who
have
not
by
observation
or
experience
become
somewhat
familiar
with
this
disease
its
manifestations
are
both
constitutional
and
local
and
their
intensity
varies
exceedingly
in
different
cases
the
constitutional
symptoms
are
usually
the
first
to
appear
and
are
of
a
febrile
character
a
distinct
chill
attended
by
nausea
and
general
derangement
of
the
stomach
is
experienced
followed
by
febrile
symptoms
more
or
less
severe
there
are
wandering
pains
in
the
body
and
sometimes
a
passive
delirium
exists
simultaneously
with
these
symptoms
the
local
manifestations
of
the
disease
appear
a
red
spot
develops
on
the
face
the
ear
or
other
part
of
the
person
its
boundary
is
clearly
marked
and
the
affected
portion
slightly
raised
above
the
surrounding
surface
it
is
characterized
by
a
burning
pain
and
is
very
sensitive
to
the
touch
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
benefit
of
the
popular
reader
that
we
should
draw
a
distinction
between
the
different
varieties
of
this
malady
the
distinctions
made
are
founded
chiefly
upon
the
to
which
the
morbid
condition
attends
and
not
on
any
difference
in
the
of
the
suppuration
of
the
tissues
involved
is
common
in
the
severer
forms
should
the
tongue
become
dark
and
diarrhea
set
in
attended
with
great
prostration
the
case
is
very
serious
and
energetic
means
must
be
employed
to
save
life
a
retrocession
of
the
inflammation
from
the
surface
to
a
vital
organ
is
an
extremely
dangerous
symptom
the
disease
is
not
regarded
as
contagious
but
has
been
known
to
become
epidemic
treatment
the
treatment
during
the
initial
stage
of
this
disease
should
correspond
with
the
general
principles
laid
down
for
the
treatment
of
fever
the
spirit
with
warm
diaphoretic
teas
or
the
compound
extract
of
may
be
given
to
favor
sweating
the
whole
person
should
be
frequently
bathed
in
warm
water
rendered
alkaline
by
the
addition
of
saleratus
or
soda
the
bowels
should
be
moved
by
a
full
dose
of
the
purgative
pellets
fluid
extract
of
aconite
in
small
and
frequent
doses
will
best
control
the
fever
the
specific
treatment
which
should
not
be
omitted
consists
in
administering
doses
of
ten
drops
of
the
tincture
of
the
muriate
of
iron
in
alternation
with
teaspoonful
doses
of
the
golden
medical
discovery
every
three
hours
as
a
local
application
the
inflamed
surface
may
be
covered
with
cloths
wet
in
the
mucilage
of
slippery
elm
equal
parts
of
sweet
oil
and
spirits
of
turpentine
mixed
and
painted
over
the
surface
is
an
application
of
unsurpassed
efficacy
diphtheria
this
is
an
exceedingly
grave
constitutional
disease
characterized
by
a
rapid
breaking
down
of
the
powers
of
life
together
with
a
peculiar
affection
of
the
throat
in
which
a
disposition
to
the
formation
of
false
membranes
is
a
prominent
feature
the
formation
of
these

may
occur
on
mucous
surfaces
elsewhere

the
specific
germ
of
the

inoculation
it
can
be
carried
in

or
water
and
the
germs
can
attach
themselves
to

a
person
with
chronic
diphtheretic
sore
throat
can
infect
children
or
susceptible
persons
with
the
disease
in
its
most
acute
type
by
kissing
all
persons
with
sore
throat
should
avoid
kissing
as
this
disease
is
commonly
spread
in
this
way
symptoms
the
symptoms
vary
in
different
cases
in
some
the
disease
comes
on
gradually
while
in
others
it
is
malignant
from
the
first
the
throat
feels
sore
the
neck
is
stiff
and
a
sense
of
languor
lassitude
and
exhaustion
pervades
the
system
sometimes
a
chill
is
experienced
at
the
outset
febrile
disturbance
generally
of
a
low
typhoid
character
soon
manifests
itself
the
skin
is
hot
there
is
intense
thirst
the
pulse
is
quick
and
feeble
ranging
from
to
per
minute
the
tongue
is
generally
loaded
with
a
dirty
coat
or
it
may
be
bright
red
the
odor
of
the
breath
is
characteristic
and
peculiarly
offensive
and
there
is
difficulty
in
swallowing
and
sometimes
in
breathing
vomiting
is
sometimes
persistent
if
we
examine
the
throat
we
find
more
or
less
swelling
of
the
tonsils
and
surrounding
parts
which
are
generally
bright
red
and
shining
and
covered
with
a
profuse
glairy
tenacious
secretion
sometimes
the
parts
are
of
a
dusky
livid
hue
and
in
rare
instances
pallid
the
false
membrane
a
peculiar
tough
exudation
soon
appears
and
may
be
seen
in
patches
large
or
small
or
covering
the
entire
surface
from
the
gums
back
as
far
as
can
be
seen
its
color
varying
from
a
whitish
yellow
to
a
gray
or
dark
ashen
tint
when
it
is
thrown
off
it
sometimes
leaves
a
foul
ulcerating
surface
beneath
the
prostration
soon
becomes
extreme
and
small
livid
spots
may
appear
on
the
surface
of
the
body
there
may
be
delirium
which
is
in
fatal
cases
succeeded
by
stupor
or
coma
the
extremities
become
cold
diarrhea
and
in
some
cases
convulsions
indicate
the
approach
of
death
sometimes
the
patient
dies
before
the
false
membrane
forms
treatment
the
extremely
dangerous
character
of
this
disease
demands
that
the
services
of
a
skillful
physician
be
obtained
at
once
and
that
his
efforts
should
be
aided
by
the
most
thorough
hygienic
precautions
good
fresh
air
bathing
and
a
supporting
diet
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
physician
lose
no
time
in
using
plenty
of
good
brandy
or
whiskey
to
offset
the
extremely
weakening
effect
of
the
disease
the
employment
of
alcoholic
stimulation
in
this
disease
is
almost
always
used
by
physicians
control
the
vomiting
and
allay
the
thirst
by
allowing
the
patient
to
suck
small
pieces
of
ice
every
five
or
ten
minutes
hot
fomentations
or
spirits
of
turpentine
should
be
applied
to
the
throat
if
the
physician
does
not
take
charge
of
the
patient
by
this
time
the
use
of
permanganate
of
potash
triturated
in
strength
of
one
grain
to
the
ounce
in
a
mixture
of
fine
sugar
of
milk
and
gum
acacia
and
blown
over
the
parts
with
an
insufflater
every
few
hours
brings
the
best
results
if
thoroughly
carried
out
or
the
throat
can
be
swabbed
out
with
the
following
mixture
chlorate
of
potash
four
drachms
tincture
of
muriate
of
iron
three
drachms
syrup
of
orange
two
ounces
water
sufficient
to
make
four
ounces
administered
every
two
or
three
hours
inhaling
steam
or
from
a
steam
atomizer
is
especially
good
the
use
of
blisters
caustics
active
purges
mercurials
or
bleeding
should
be
condemned
throughout
the
whole
course
of
the
disease
the
strength
must
be
supported
by
the
most
nourishing
diet
as
well
as
by
tonics
and
stimulants
beef
tea
milk
milk
punch
and
brandy
should
be

treatment
in

the
spirit
is
invaluable
the

useful
the

beneficial
a
carthartic
should
be
given
at

when
the

does
not
show
a
disposition
to
yield
to
this
treatment
the
services
of
a

should
be
obtained
when

which
may
be
known
by

chronic
enlargement
of
the

as
shown
in

is
an
exceedingly
common
affection
it
is
most
common
to
those
of
a
scrofulous

it
rarely
makes
its
appearance
after
the

symptoms
the
voice
is
often
husky
nasal
or
guttural
and
disagreeable
when
the
patient
sleeps
a
low
moaning
is
heard
accompanied
with
snoring
and
stentorian
breathing
and
the
head
is
thrown
back
so
as
to
bring
the
mouth
on
a
line
with
the
windpipe
and
thus
facilitate
the
ingress
of
air
into
the
lungs
when
the
affection
becomes
serious
it
interferes
with
breathing
and
swallowing
the
chest
is
liable
to
become
flattened
in
front
and
arched
behind
in
consequence
of
the
difficulty
of
respiration
thus
predisposing
the
patient
to
pulmonary
disease
on
looking
into
the
throat
the
enlarged
tonsils
may
be
seen
as
in
the
figure
sometimes
they
are
so
greatly
increased
in
size
that
they
touch
each
other
treatment
the
indications
to
be
carried
out
in
the
cure
of
this
malady
are
to
remedy
the
constitutional
derangement
to
remove
the
enlargement
of
the
tonsil
glands
the
successful
fulfillment
of
the
first
indication
may
be
readily
accomplished
by
attention
to
hygiene
diet
clothing
and
the
use
of
the
golden
medical
discovery
together
with
small
daily
doses
of
the
pleasant
purgative
pellets
this
treatment
should
be
persevered
in
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
after
the
enlargement
has
disappeared
to
prevent
a
return
to
fulfill
the
second
indication
astringent
gargles
may
be
used
infusions
of

cranesbill
should
be
used
during

mixture
is
unsurpassed
iodine
one
drachm
iodide
of

four

pure
soft
water
two

apply
this
preparation
to
the
enlarged
tonsils
twice
a
day
with
a

or
soft
swab
being
careful
to
paint
them
each
time
a
persevering
use
of
these
remedies
both
internal
and
local
is
necessary
to
reduce
and
restore
the
parts
to
a
healthy
condition
sometimes
the
enlarged
tonsils
undergo
calcareous
degeneration
in
this
case
nothing
but
their
removal
by
a
surgical
operation
is
effectual
this
can
be
readily
accomplished
by
any
competent
surgeon
we
have
operated
in
a
large
number
of
cases
and
have
never
met
with

unfavorable
results
elongation
of
the
uvula
chronic
enlargement
or
elongation
of
the
uvula
or
palate
as
shown
at
b
fig
may
arise
from
the
same
causes
as
enlargement
of
the

it
subjects
the
individual
to
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
by
dropping
into
and
irritating
the

it
causes
tickling
and
frequent
desire
to
clear
the
throat
change
weakness
or
entire
loss
of

and
difficulty
of

frequently
giving

to
the
most
persistent
and
aggravating

treatment
the
treatment
already
laid
down
for
enlarged
tonsils
with
which
affection
elongation
of
the
uvula
is
so
often
associated
is
generally
effectual
when
it
has
existed
for

it
may
be
removed
by
any

anæmia
when
the
blood
contains
less
than
the
ordinary
number
of
red
corpuscles
the
condition
is
known
as
and
is
characterized
by
every
sign
of
debility
a
copious
hemorrhage
in
consequence
of
a
cut
or
other
serious
injury
will
lessen
the
quantity
of
blood
and
may
produce
anæmia
after
sudden
the
volume
of
the
circulation
is
quickly
restored
by
absorption
of
fluid
but
the
red
corpuscles
can
not
be
so
readily
replaced
so
that
the
blood
is
poorer
by
being
more
watery
this
is
only
one
way
in
which
the
blood
is
impoverished
the
blood
may
be
exhausted
by
a
drain
upon
the
system
in
consequence
of
hard
and
prolonged
study
severe
mental
employment
consumes
the
red
corpuscles
leaving
the
blood
thin
the
skin
cool
and
pale
and
the
extremities
moist
and
cold
anæmia
may
arise
from
lack
of
exercise
or
it
may
be
occasioned
by
mental
depression
anxiety
disappointment
trouble
acute
excitement
of
the
emotions
or
passions
spinal
irritation
in
fact
there
are
many
special
relations
existing
between
the
red
corpuscles
of
the
blood
and
the
various
states
of
the
mind
and
the
nervous
system
the
latter
depends
directly
upon
the
health
and
quantity
of
these
red
corpuscles
for
its
ability
to
execute
its
functions
anæmia
may
arise
in
consequence
of
low
diet
or
because
the
alimentary
organs
do
not
properly
digest
the
food
or
when
there
is
not
sufficient
variety
in
the
diet
no
matter
how
anæmia
is
occasioned
whether
by
labor
and
expenditure
by
hemorrhages
lead
poisoning
prolonged
exposure
to
miasmatic
influences
deprivation
of
food
indigestion
imperfect
assimilation
frequent
or
lactation
the
number
of
the
red
corpuscles
in
the
blood
is
materially
diminished
the
diagnostic
symptoms
of
anæmia
are
pallor
of
the
face
lips
tongue
and
general
surface
weakness
of
the
vital
organs
hurried
respiration
on
slight
exercise
swelling
or
puffiness
of
the
eyes
and
a
murmur
of
the
heart
resembling
the
sound
of
a
bellows
this
disorder
of
the
blood
tends
to
develop
low
inflammation
dropsical
effusion
tubercular
deposits
bright
disease
derangements
of
the
liver
diarrhea
leucorrhea
and
is
a
precursor
of
low
protracted
fevers
this
condition
of
the
blood
predisposes
to
the
development
of
other
affections
providing
they
are
in
existence
and
often
it
is
found
associated
with
bright
disease
cancer
and
lung
difficulties
treatment
prevent
all
unnecessary
waste
and
vital
expenditure
place
the
patient
under
favorable
circumstances
for
recovery
by
regulating
the
exercise
and
clothing
entertaining
the
mind
and
furnishing
plenty
of
pure
air
prescribe
such
a
nutritious
diet
as
will
agree
with
the
enfeebled
condition
of
the
patient
regular
habits
should
be
established
in
regard
to
meals
exercise
recreation
rest
and
sleep
the
use
of
tonics
and
stimulants
as
much
as
the
stomach
will
bear
should
be
encouraged
bathe
the
surface
with
a
solution
of
a
drachm
of
quinine
in
a
pint
of
whiskey
iron
in
some
form
is
the
special
internal
remedy
in
anæmia
meantime
it
is
proper
to
treat
the
patient
with
gentle
manual
friction
rubbing
the
surface
of
the
body
lightly
and
briskly
with
the
warm
dry
hand
which
greatly
stimulates
the
circulation
of
the
blood
anæmia
occurs
more
frequently
in
the
female
than
in
the
male
because
her
functions
and
duties
are
more
likely
to
give
rise
to
it
apnoea
apnoea
or
short
hurried
difficult
respiration
is
occasioned
by
certain
conditions
of
the
blood
when
anything
interferes
with
the
absorption
of
oxygen
or
the
elimination
of
carbonic
acid
the
blood
is
not
changed
from
venous
to
arterial
and
becomes
incapable
of
sustaining
life
this
morbid
condition
is
termed
we
often
read
of
persons
going
into
wells
where
there
are
noxious
gases
or
remaining
in
a
close
room
where
there
are
live
coals
generating
carbonic
acid
gas
and
thus
becoming
asphyxiated
dying
for
want
of
oxygen
deficiency
of
oxygen
is
the
cause
of
apnoea
and
sometimes
the
red
corpuscles
themselves
are
so
few
worn
out
or
destroyed
that
they
can
not
carry
sufficient
oxygen
and
the
consequence
is
that
the
patient
becomes
short
of
breath
and
when
a
fatal
degeneration
of
the
corpuscles
ensues
he
dies
of
asphyxia
many
a
child
grows
thin
and
wan
and
continues
to
waste
away
the
parents
little
dreaming
that
the
slow
consumption
of
the
red
corpuscles
of
the
blood
is
the
cause
which
is
undermining
the
health
sometimes
this
disease
is
the
result
of
starvation
irregular
feeding
improper
diet
want
of
care
and
at
other
times
want
of
fresh
air
proper
exercise
and
sunlight
treatment
the
first
essential
to
success
in
the
treatment
of
this
disease
is
the
removal
of
the
exciting
cause
exercise
in
the
outdoor
air
and
sunlight
with
good
nutritious
food
and
sleeping
apartments
are
of
the
greatest
importance
the
bitter
tonics
as
hydrastin
with
pyrophosphate
of
iron
should
be
employed
to
enrich
the
blood
and
build
up
the
strength
leucocythæmia
this
term
is
used
to
designate
a
condition
in
which
there
is
an
excess
of
colorless
in
health
the
colorless
corpuscles
should
exist
only
in
the
proportion
of
one
to
one
or
two
hundred
of
the
red
corpuscles
these
colorless
corpuscles
increase
when
there
is
disease
of
the
lymphatic
glands
but
whether
this
is
the
cause
of
their
increase
or
perversion
is
not
known
they
have
been
found
abundant
in
the
blood
in
diseases
of
the
spleen
and
of
the
liver
diarrhea
usually
attends
this
complaint
together
with
difficult
breathing
loss
of
strength
gradual
decline
fever
diminution
of
vital
forces
and
finally
death
the
recovery
of
a
case
of
this
disease
is
very
doubtful
its
average
duration
is
about
one
year
dropsies
is
the
passage
of
fluid
through
the
tissue
of
any
part
of
the
body
without
changing
its
liquid
state
while
means
medically
the
passage
of
matter
which
coagulates
and
gives
rise
to
solid
deposits
when
transudations
are
unhealthy
they
may
accumulate
in
serous
cavities
or
in
cellular
structures
and
constitute
exudation
is
the
result
of
inflammation
and
the
product
effused
coagulates
and
becomes
the
seat
of
a
new
growth
of
tissue
exosmosis
means
the
passage
of
fluid
from
within
outward
and
is
a
process
constantly
taking
place
in
health
while
transudation
takes
place
because
the
blood
is
watery
and
the
tissues
are
feeble
and
permeable
permitting
the
serum
and
watery
elements
of
the
blood
to
pass
into
certain
cavities
where
they
accumulate
the
cause
of
dropsies
may
be
low
diet
insufficient
exercise
indigestion
hemorrhages
wasting
diseases
in
fact
any
thing
which
impoverishes
the
blood
and
increases
the
relative
amount
of
serum
the
tardy
circulation
of
blood
in
the
veins
or
its
obstruction
in
any
way
is
a
condition
highly
favorable
to
the
development
of
dropsy
general
dropsy
is
called
and
is
readily
distinguished
by
bloating
or
puffiness
of
the
skin
all
over
the
body
this
condition
is
also
called
the
skin
is
pale
yields
under
the
finger
without
pain
and
preserves
the
impression
for
some
time
the
oedema
usually
appears
first
in
the
lower
extremities
next
in
the
face
and
from
thence
extends
over
the
body
general
dropsy
is
commonly
due
to
an
impoverished
condition
of
the
blood
and
this
may
be
the
result
of
a
disease
of
the
kidneys
albuminuria
is
frequently
the
sequel
of
scarlatina
hence
the
utmost
care
should
be
taken
against
exposure
of
a
patient
recovering
from
scarlatina
and
the
same
caution
should
be
exercised
during
convalescence
from
measles
erysipelas
and
rheumatism
dropsies
may
be
general
as
in
anasarca
or
local
as
dropsy
of
the
heart
called
dropsy
dropsy
of
the
peritoneum
the
serous
membrane
which
lines
the
abdominal
cavity
called
dropsy
of
the
chest
called
dropsy
of
the
head
called
dropsy
of
the
scrotum
called
dropsy
is
not
therefore
of
itself
a
disease
but
only
the
symptom
of
a
morbid
condition
of
the
blood
kidneys
liver
or
heart
thus
disease
of
the
valves
of
the
heart
may
obstruct
the
free
flow
of
blood
and
thus
retard
its
circulution
in
consequence
the
pulse
grows
small
and
weak
and
the
patient
can
not
exercise
or
labor
as
usual
and
finally
the
lower
limbs
begin
to
swell
then
the
face
and
body
the
skin
looks
dusky
the
appetite
is
impaired
the
kidneys
become
diseased
there
is
difficulty
in
breathing
and
the
patient
it
is
said
dies
of
dropsy
yet
dropsy
was
the
result
of
a
disease
of
the
heart
which
retarded
the
circulation
and
enfeebled
the
system
and
which
was
actually
the
primary
cause
of
death
treatment
dropsy
being
only
a
symptom
of
various
morbid
conditions
existing
in
the
system
any
treatment
to
be
radically
beneficial
must
therefore
have
reference
to
the
diseased
conditions
upon
which
the
dropsical
effusion
in
each
individual
case
depends
these
are
so
various
and
frequently
so
obscure
as
to
require
the
best
diagnostic
skill
possessed
by
the
experienced
specialist
to
detect
them
there
are
however
a
few
general
principles
which
are
applicable
to
the
treatment
of
nearly
all
cases
of
dropsy
nutritious
diet
frequent
alkaline
baths
to
keep
the
skin
in
good
condition
and
favor
excretion
through
its
pores
and
a
general
hygienic
regulation
of
the
daily
habits
are
of
the
greatest
importance
there
are
also
a
few
general
remedies
which
may
prove
more
or
less
beneficial
in
nearly
all
cases
we
refer
to
diuretics
and
hydragogue
cathartics
the
object
sought
in
the
administration
of
these
is
the
evacuation
of
the
accumulated
fluids
through
the
kidneys
and
bowels
thus
giving
relief
of
the
diuretics
queen
of
the
meadow
buchu
and
digitalis
generally
operate
well
as
a
cathartic
the
purgative
pellets
accompanied
with
a
teaspoonful
or
two
of
cream
of
tartar
will
prove
serviceable
beyond
these
general
principles
of
treatment
it
would
be
useless
for
us
to
attempt
to
advise
the
invalid
suffering
from
any
one
of
the
many
forms
of
dropsy
the
specialist
skilled
by
large
experience
in
detecting
the
exact
morbid
condition
which
causes
the
watery
effusion
and
accumulation
can
select
his
remedies
to
meet
the
peculiar
indications
presented
by
each
individual
case
sometimes
the
removal
of
the
watery
accumulation
by
tapping
becomes
necessary
in
order
to
afford
relief
and
give
time
for
remedies
to
act
we
have
found
it
necessary
to
perform
this
operation
very
frequently
in
cases
of
and
also
quite
often
in
cases
of
abdominal
dropsy
the

has
also

canadian
gentleman
aged
applied
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
for
examination
and
treatment
he
had
been
dropsical
for
over
two
years
and
had
become
so
badly
affected
as
to
be
unable
to
lie
down
at
night
his
legs
were
so
filled
with
water
and
enlarged
as
to
render
it
almost
impossible
for
him
to
walk
and
there
was
a
general
anasarca
the
least
exertion
was
attended
with
the
greatest
difficulty
of
breathing
he
had
been
under
the
treatment
of
several
eminent
general
practitioners
of
medicine
in
canada
but
found
no
relief
they
were
unable
to
discover
the
real
cause
of
his
ailment
but
to
the
specialist
who
has
charge
of
this
class
of
diseases
at
our
institution
and
who
annually
examines
and
treats
hundreds
of
such
cases
it
was
at
once
apparent
that
the
dropsy
was
caused
from
a
weakened
condition
of
the
heart
which
rendered
it
unable
to
perform
its
functions
he
was
put
upon
a
tonic
and
alterative
course
of
treatment
which
also
embraced
the
use
of
such
medicines
as
have
been
found
to
exert
a
specific
tonic
action
upon
the
muscular
tissues
of
the
heart
he
improved
so
rapidly
that
in
less
than
two
months
he
was
able
to
lie
down
and
sleep
soundly
all
night
the
bloating
disappeared
his
strength
improved
and
in
three
month
more
he
was
discharged
perfectly
cured
case
ii
a
man
aged
consulted
us
by
letter
stating
that
he
was
troubled
with
general
bloating
which
had
made
its
appearance
gradually
and
was
attended
by
general
debility
and
other
symptoms
which
have
been
enumerated
as
common
to
general
dropsy
he
had
been
under
the
treatment
of
several
home
physicians
without
receiving
any
benefit
he
had
steadily
grown
worse
until
he
felt
satisfied
that
if
he
did
not
soon
get
relief
he
could
not
live
very
long
he
was
requested
to
send
a
sample
of
his
urine
for
examination
as
we
had
suspicions
from
the
symptoms
which
he
gave
that
the
cause
of
his
dropsy
was
or
bright
disease
of
the
kidneys
on
examination
of
the
urine
albumen
in
very
perceptible
quantities
was
found
to
be
present
we
had
about
this
time
come
into
possession
of
a
remedy
said
by
very
good
authority
to
be
a
specific
in
degeneration
of
the
kidneys
when
not
too
far
advanced
and
we
determined
to
test
it
upon
this
case
we
accordingly
prescribed
it
together
with
other
proper
tonics
and
alteratives
at
the
same
time
giving
the
patient
important
hygienic
advice
which
must
be
complied
with
if
success
is
attained
in
the
management
of
this
very
fatal
malady
our
patient
gradually
improved
and
in
a
few
months
time
was
restored
to
perfect
health
which
he
has
continued
to
enjoy
ever
since
from
our
subsequent
experience
embracing
the
treatment
of
quite
a
large
number
of
cases
of
bright
disease
of
the
kidneys
we
are
satisfied
that
it
is
in
its
early
stage
quite
amenable
to
treatment
case
iii
a
man
aged
single
consulted
us
for
what
he
supposed
to
be
enlargement
of
the
testicles
the
scrotum
was
as
large
as
his
head
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
could
conceal
the
deformity
from
general
observation
the
disease
was
immediately
recognized
by
the
attending
surgeon
as
hydrocele
the
liquid
was
promptly
drawn
oft
by
tapping
and
a
stimulating
injection
was
made
into
the
scrotum
to
prevent
we
mention
this
case
only
because
it
is
one
among
a
very
large
number
who
have
consulted
us
supposing
that
they
were
suffering
from
enlargement
of
the
testicles
cancer
or
some
other
morbid
growth
within
the
scrotum
when
a
slight
examination
has
shown
the
affection
to
be
hydrocele
a
disease
which
is
speedily
cured
by
tapping
with
a
little
after
treatment
the
operation
is
perfectly
safe
and
almost
entirely
painless
case
iv
a
lady
aged
consulted
us
by
letter
enumerating
a
long
list
of
symptoms
which
clearly
indicated
abdominal
dropsy
resulting
from
suppression
of
the
menses
a
hygienic
treatment
was
advised
and
medicines
to
restore
the
menstrual
function
by
gradually
toning
up
and
regulating
the
whole
system
were
forwarded
to
her
by
express
after
four
months
treatment
perfect
recovery
resulted
cases
like
this
latter
are
very
common
and
generally
yield
quite
readily
to
proper
management
no
harsh
or
forcing
treatment
for
restoring
the
menstrual
function
should
be
employed
as
it
will
not
only
fail
to
accomplish
the
object
sought
but
it
is
also
sure
to
seriously
and
irreparably
injure
the
system
the
most
difficult
cases
which
we
have
had
to
deal
with
have
been
those
which
had
been
subjected
by
other
physicians
to
the
administration
of
strong
emmenagogues
in
the
vain
effort
to
bring
on
the
menses
rheumatism
prominent
among
constitutional
diseases
is
the
one
known
as
it
is
characterized
by
certain
local
symptoms
or
manifestations
in
fibrous
tissues
this
term
has
been
applied
to
neuralgic
affections
and
to
but
it
differs
from
each
in
several
essential
particulars
rheumatism
may
be
divided
into
acute
articular
rheumatism
acute
articular
rheumatism
implies
an
affection
of
the
articulations
or
joints
it
usually
commences
suddenly
sometimes
pain
or
soreness
in
the
joints
precedes
the
disclosure
of
the
disease
the
symptoms
are
pain
in
the
joints
tenderness
increased
heat
swelling
and
redness
of
the
skin
the
pain
varies
in
its
intensity
in
different
oases
and
is
increased
by
the
movement
of
the
affected
parts
swelling
of
the
joints
occurs
especially
those
of
the
knee
ankle
wrist
elbow
and
the
smaller
joints
of
the
hands
and
feet
the
swelling
and
redness
are
generally
in
proportion
to
the
acuteness
of
the
attack
acute
articular
rheumatism
is
always
accompanied
with
more
or
less
fever
sweating
is
generally
a
prominent
symptom
being
strongly
acid
and
more
profuse
during
the
night
the
appetite
is
impaired
the
tongue
is
coated
the
bowels
are
constipated
or
there
is
diarrhea
the
duration
of
this
disease
unlike
fevers
its
course
is
marked
by
fluctuations
frequently
after
a
few
days
the
pain
subsides
the
fever
disappears
and
convalescence
is
apparently
established
when
suddenly
all
the
symptoms
are
renewed
with
even
greater
intensity
than
before
this
disease
rarely
proves
fatal
unless
the
heart
is
involved
causes
rheumatism
is
frequently
supposed
to
be
occasioned
by
a
suppression
of
the
functions
of
the
skin
and
is
generally
attributed
to
the
action
of
cold
upon
the
surface
of
the
body
but
this
acts
only
as
an
exciting
cause
it
is
a
disease
of
the
blood
this
form
of
rheumatism
usually
occurs
between
the
age
of
fifteen
and
thirty
and
prevails
most
extensively
in
changeable
climates
acute
articular
rheumatism
seldom
terminates
in
the
chronic
form
chronic
articular
rheumatism
articular
rheumatism
in
the
subacute
or
chronic
form
is
frequently
observed
in
medical
practice
the
symptoms
are
pain
and
more
or
less
swelling
of
the
joints
although
not
of
as
grave
a
character
as
in
acute
rheumatism
there
is
frequently
an
absence
of
increased
heat
and
redness
as
in
the
acute
form
the
different
joints
are
liable
to
be
affected
successively
and
irregularly
until
after
a
time
the
disease
becomes
fixed
in
a
single
joint
and
the
fibrous
tissues
entering
into
the
ligaments
and
tendons
are
liable
to
be
affected
the
appetite
digestion
and
nutrition
are
often
good
and
in
mild
cases
patients
are
able
to
pursue
their
daily
vocations
the
disease
is
supposed
to
be
the
same
as
in
the
acute
form
but
milder
and
strange
to
say
more
persistent
a
diseased
condition
of
the
blood
is
supposed
to
be
involved
in
both
instances
but
this
morbid
state
is
less
extended
and
at
the
same
time
more
obstinate
in
the
chronic
than
in
the
acute
form
articular
rheumatism
is
not
always
chronic
and
may
disappear
in
a
shorter
time
than
in
the
acute
form
chronic
articular
rheumatism
is
not
generally
fatal
but
there
is
danger
of
permanent
deformities
muscular
rheumatism
this
affection
is
closely
allied
to
and
may
properly
be
called
it
exists
under
two
forms
acute
and
chronic
in
acute
muscular
rheumatism
there
is
at
first
a
dull
pain
in
the
muscles
which
gradually
increases
when
the
affected
muscles
are
not
used
the
pain
is
slight
and
certain
positions
may
be
assumed
without
inducing
it
constantly
but
in
movements
which
involve
contraction
of
the
muscles
the
pain
is
very
violent
in
some
cases
the
disease
is
movable
changing
from
one
muscle
to
another
but
usually
it
remains
fixed
in
the
muscle
first
attacked
the
appetite
and
digestion
are
not
often
impaired
and
there
is
no
fever
the
duration
of
this
form
of
rheumatism
varies
from
a
few
hours
to
a
week
or
more
in
subacute
or
chronic
muscular
rheumatism
pain
is
excited
only
when
the
affected
muscles
are
contracted
with
unusual
force
and
then
it
is
similar
to
that
experienced
in
the
acute
form
the
chronic
form
is
more
apt
to
change
its
position
than
the
acute
the
duration
of
this
form
is
indefinite
in
both
the
acute
and
chronic
forms
some
particular
parts
of
the
body
are
more
subject
to
the
affection
than
others
the
muscles
on
the
posterior
part
of
the
are
subject
to
rheumatic
affection
it
is
termed
or
rheumatism
in
such
cases
and
should
be
distinguished
from
ordinary
neuralgia
when
the
muscles
of
the
loins
are
affected
it
is
commonly
known
as
in
case
the
thoracic
muscles
are
affected
it
is
known
as
in
coughing
sneezing
and
the
like
the
pain
produced
is
not
unlike
that
in
pleuritis
and
intercostal
neuralgia
one
of
the
most
marked
features
of
muscular
rheumatism
is
the
pain
induced
by
the
movements
of
the
affected
muscles
whereas
the
pain
is
slight
when
those
muscles
are
uncontracted
this
feature
is
very
serviceable
in
distinguishing
muscular
rheumatism
or
myalgia
from
neuralgic
affections
another
trait
which
distinguishes
muscular
rheumatism
from
neuralgia
is
that
the
former
is
characterized
by
great
soreness
while
the
latter
is
not
there
is
also
a
distinction
between
inflammation
of
the
muscles
and
muscular
rheumatism
in
the
case
of
the
former
there
is
continued
pain
swelling
of
the
parts
occasional
redness
and
the
presence
of
more
or
less
fever
which
conditions
do
not
exist
in
the
latter
persons
subject
to
rheumatism
of
the
muscles
are
apt
to
suffer
from
an
attack
after
exposure
of
the
body
to
a
draught
of
air
during
sleep
or
when
in
a
state
of
perspiration
treatment
of
acute
rheumatism
administer
the
spirit
to
produce
free
perspiration
which
should
be
maintained
by
full
doses
of
the
compound
extract
of
the
anodyne
properties
of
the
latter
also
prove
very
valuable
in
allaying
the
pain
tincture
or
fluid
extract
of
aconite
root
may
also
be
employed
to
assist
in
equalizing
the
circulation
and
also
to
secure
its
anodyne
action
black
cohosh
seems
to
exert
a
specific
and
salutary
influence
in
this
disease
and
the
tincture
or
fluid
extract
of
the
root
of
this
plant
may
be
advantageously
combined
with
the
aconite
take
fluid
extract
of
thirty
drops
fluid
extract
of
black
cohosh
one
drachm
water
fifteen
teaspoonfuls
mix
the
dose
is
one
teaspoonful
every
hour
the
whole
person
should
be
frequently
bathed
with
warm
water
rendered
alkaline
by
the
addition
of
saleratus
or
soda
the
painful
joints
may
be
packed
with
wool
or
with
cloths
wrung
from
the
hot
saleratus
water
and
the
patient
kept
warm
and
quiet
in
bed
the
acetate
of
potash
taken
in
doses
of
five
grains
well
diluted
with
water
every
three
or
four
hours
is
very
valuable
in
acute
rheumatism
its
alkaline
qualities
tend
to
neutralize
the
acid
condition
of
the
fluids
of
the
system
and
it
also
possesses
diuretic
properties
which
act
upon
the
kidneys
removing
the
offending
from
the
system
through
these
organs
if
the
joints
are
very
painful
cloths
wet
with
the
compound
extract
of
and
applied
to
them
and
covered
with
hot
fomentations
very
frequently
relieve
the
suffering
the
majority
of
cases
yield
quite
promptly
to
the
course
of
treatment
already
advised
if
it
is
persevered
in
the
disease
however
sometimes
proves
obstinate
and
resists
for
many
days
the
best
treatment
yet
known
to
the
medical
profession
treatment
of
chronic
rheumatism
the
general
alkaline
baths
recommended
in
the
acute
affection
are
also
valuable
in
the
chronic
the
spirit
the
turkish
as
well
as
the
sulphur
are
all
worthy
of
a
trial
in
this
obstinate
and
painful
disease
alternatives
are
a
very
valuable
class
of
agents
in
chronic
rheumatism
the
following
mixture
in
teaspoonful
doses
three
times
a
day
in
alternation
with
the
golden
medical
discovery
has
proved
very
successful
in
this
disease
acetate
of
potash
one
ounce
fluid
extract
of
black
cohosh
one
ounce
fluid
extract
of
poison
hemlock
two
drachms
simple
syrup
six
ounces
this
thorough
alterative
course
if
well
persevered
in
together
with
the
use
of
alkaline
and
will
generally
prove
very
successful
the
specialist
however
dealing
with
chronic
diseases
exclusively
will
occasionally
meet
with
a
case
which
has
been
the
rounds
of
the
home
physicians
without
benefit
that
will
tax
his
skill
and
require
the
exercise
of
all
his
perceptive
faculties
to
determine
the
exact
condition
of
the
patient
system
upon
which
the
obstinacy
of
the
disease
depends
when
this
is
ascertained
the
remedies
will
naturally
suggest
themselves
and
the
malady
will
generally
yield
to
them
but
although
the
treatment
of
this
disease
has
entered
largely
into
our
practice
at
the
invalid
hotel
and
has
been
attended
by
the
most
happy
results
yet
the
cases
have
presented
so
great
a
diversity
of
abnormal
features
and
have
required
so
many
variations
in
the
course
of
treatment
to
be
met
successfully
that
we
frankly
acknowledge
our
inability
to
so
instruct
the
unprofessional
reader
as
to
enable
him
to
detect
the
various
systemic
faults
common
to
this
disease
and
adjust
remedies
to
them
so
as
to
make
the
treatment
uniformly
successful
if
the
several
plans
of
treatment
which
we
have
given
do
not
conquer
the
disease
we
can
not
better
advise
the
invalid
than
to
recommend
him
to
employ
a
physician
of
skill
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
diseases
if
such
a
one
is
not
accessible
for
personal
consultation
a
careful
statement
of
all
the
prominent
symptoms
in
writing
may
be
forwarded
to
a
specialist
of
large
experience
in
this
disease
who
will
readily
detect
the
real
fault
in
which
the
ailment
has
its
foundation
particularly
easy
will
it
be
for
him
to
do
so
if
he
be
an
expert
in
the
analysis
of
urine
a
vial
of
that
which
is
first
passed
in
the
morning
should
be
sent
with
the
history
of
the
case
as
chronic
rheumatism
effects
characteristic
changes
in
this
excretion
which
clearly
and
unmistakably
indicate
the
abnormal
condition
of
the
fluids
of
the
body
upon
which
the
disease
depends
diseases
of
the
skin
eczematous
affections
eczematous
affections
constitute
a
very
important
class
of
skin
diseases
the
prominent
characteristics
of
which
are
and
they
are
progressive
in
character
passing
through
all
the
successive
stages
of
development
from
mere
redness
of
the
skin
to
desquamation
or
thickening
of
the
cuticle
the
affections
belonging
to
this
group
are
psoriasis
pityriasis
lichen
impetigo
gutta
rosacea
and
or
a
careful
examination
of
each
of
these
diseases
shows
it
to
be
a
modified
form
of
eczema
and
therefore
they
demand
similar
treatment
eczema
tetter
running
or
the
term
is
used
to
designate
the
commonest
kind
of
skin
diseases
in
this
disease
the
minute
are
congested
causing
the
skin
to
be
more
vascular
and
redder
than
in
its
natural
state
there
is
an
itching
or
smarting
in
the
affected
parts
the
skin
is
raised
in
the
form
of
little
pimples
or
vesicles
and
a
watery
lymph
exudes
sometimes
the
skin
becomes
detached
and
is
replaced
by
a
crust
of
hardened
lymph
or
it
may
be
partially
reproduced
forming
or
scales
there
are
three
stages
of
this
disease
the
inflammatory
accompanied
by
swelling
and
the
formation
of
pimples
or
vesicles
that
of
exudation
which
is
succeeded
by
incrustation
and
that
of
desquamation
in
which
the
skin
separates
in
little
scales
and
sometimes
becomes
thickened
rarely
if
ever
does
the
disease
pass
through
these
successive
stages
but
it
is
modified
by
its
location
and
the
temperament
of
the
patient
the
many
varieties
of
eczema
are
designated
according
to
their
predominating
characteristics
thus
when
pimples
or
vesicles

country
who
have
not
by
observation
or
experience
become
somewhat
familiar
with
this
disease
its
manifestations
are
both
constitutional
and
local
and
their
intensity
varies
exceedingly
in
different
cases
the
constitutional
symptoms
are
usually
the
first
to
appear
and
are
of
a
febrile
character
a
distinct
chill
attended
by
nausea
and
general
derangement
of
the
stomach
is
experienced
followed
by
febrile
symptoms
more
or
less
severe
there
are
wandering
pains
in
the
body
and
sometimes
a
passive
delirium
exists
simultaneously

by

is
very
sensitive

it
is
not
necessary
for
the
information
of
the
general
reader
that
we
should
draw
a
distinction
between
the
different
varieties
of
this
malady
the
distinctions
made
are
founded
chiefly
upon
the
to
which
the
morbid
condition
extends
and
not
on
any
difference
in
the
of
the
suppuration
of
the
tissues
involved
is
common
in
the
severer
forms
should
the
tongue
become
dark

prostration
the
case
is
very
serious

energetic
means
should
be
employed
to

life
a
retrocession
of
the
inflammation
from
the
surface
to
a

this
word
is
derived
from

appropriately
named

urticaria
may
be
either
acute
or
chronic
acute
urticaria
is
always
preceded
by
febrile
symptoms
and
the
attack
is
indicated
by
a
sudden
congestion
of
the
skin
followed
by
a
slight
swelling

predisposing
causes
are
conceded
to
be
assimilative
and
nervous
debility
hence
it
frequently
accompanies
purpura
or
land
scurvy

rheumatism
the
skin
in
some
persons
is
so
susceptible
to
irritation
that
urticaria
can
be
kindled
at
any
moment
by
excitement
as
an
animated
conversation
or
by
the
simple
pressure
of

the
proper
treatment
for

consists
in
applying
to
the

parts
a
little

glycerine
with
the
use
of

synonymous

the
reader
may
very
naturally
be
led
to
inquire
what
is
tubercle
as
employed
in
pathology
the
term
is
usually
applied
to
a
species
of
degeneration
or
morbid
development
of
a
pale
yellow
color
having
in
its
crude
condition
a
consistence
analogous
to
that
of

firm

the
physical
properties
of
tubercle
are
not
uniform
however
they
vary
with
age
and
other
circumstances
some
are
hard
and
calcareous
while
others
are
soft
and
the
color
varies
from
a
light
yellow
or
almost
white
to
a
dark

it
is
almost
wholly
composed
of
albumen
united
with

of

the

in

its

the
result
of

the

tissues
imperfectly
formed
albuminous
matter
oozes
out
from
the
blood
and
infiltrates
the
tissues
but
it
has
little
tendency
to
take
on
or
undergo
the
vital
transformation
essential
to
becoming
a
part
of
the
tissues
instead
of
nutritive
energy
which
by
assimilation
produces
perfect
bodily
textures
this
function
in
the
scrofulous
diathesis
is
deranged
by
debility
and
there
is
left
in
the
tissues
an
imperfectly
organized
particle
incapable
of
undergoing
a
complete
vital
change
around
which
cluster
other
particles
of
tubercular
matter
forming
little
grains
like
millet
seed
or
growing
by
new
accretions
of
like
particles
to
masses
of
more
extensive
size
as
tubercle
is
but
a
substance
of
deficient
vitality
it
is
very
prone
to
disintegration
and
suppuration
being
foreign
to
the
tissues
in
which
it
is
embedded
like
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
it
excites
a
passive
form
of
inflammation
and
from
lack
of
inherent
vital
energy
it
is
apt
to
decompose
and
cause
the
formation
of
pus

infiltration
of
the
muscles

or
other
soft
parts
with
tuberculous
matter
when

food
or

diet
with

than
in

the
season
of

also
greatly
influences

for
it
frequently
commences
in
the
winter

and
disappears
again
in

and
the

the

should
be
generous
and
of
the
most
nourishing
character
steady
habits
and
regular
hours
for
eating

must
be
observed
if
we
would
restore

regularity
to

moderate
exercise

is
essential
in
order
that
the

may
become

oxygenated
that

it
is
no
doubt
true
that
the
occasion
of
the
prevalence
of

among

lower
classes
may
be
ascribed
to
frequent
and
severe
climatic
exposures
irregular

want
of

every
family
can
avoid
such
causes
and
live
with
a
due
regard
to
the
conditions
of
health
the
proper
treatment
of
scrofula
is
important
because
we
meet
with
its
symptoms
on
every
side
showing
its
slow
actions
upon
different
parts
of
the
body
and
its
influence
upon
all
the
organs
after
this
disease
has
been
existing
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
certain
glands
enlarge
slowly
inflame
finally
suppurate
and
are
very
difficult
to
heal
these
sores
are
very
liable
to
degenerate
into
ulcers
all
of
these
symptoms
point
to
a
peculiar
taste
of
the
blood
which
continually
feeds
and
strengthens
this
morbid
outbreak
all
authors
agree
that
the
blood
is
not
rich
in
fibrinous
elements
but
tends
to
feebleness
and
slow
inflammation
which
ends
in
maturation
thus
we
may
trace
back
this
low
and
morbid
condition
of
the
blood
to
debility
of
the
nutritive
organs
defective
digestion
which
may
be
induced
by
irregular
habits
a
lack
of
nourishing
food
or
by
the
acquirement
of
some
venereal
taint
the
matter
that
is
discharged
from
these
glands
is
not
healthy
but
is
thin

and
acrid

fluid
containing
little
fragments
of
tuberculous
matter
which
resembles

the
affected
glands
ulcerate
look
blue
and
indolent
and

no
disposition
to

we
have
thus
traced
this
disorder
back
to
weak
perverted
and
faulty
nutrition
to
disordered
and
vitiated
blood
the
products
of
which
slowly
inflame
the
glands
which
strain
out
unhealthy
irritating
poisonous
matter
the
medicines
to
remedy
this
perverted
condition
of
the
blood
and
fluids
must
be
alteratives
which
will
act
upon
the
digestive
organs
and
tone
the
nutritive
functions
thus
enriching
and
purifying
the
blood
as
this
affection
is
frequently
a
complication
in
chronic
diseases
it
is
eminently
proper
for
us
to
refer
to
a
few
considerations
involved
in
its

an
alterative
medicine
belongs
to
a
class

is
considered
capable
of
producing
a
salutary
change
in
a
disease
without
exciting
any
sensible
evacuation
in
scrofula
remedies
should
be
employed
which
will
improve
digestion
and
also
prevent
certain
morbid
operations
in
the
blood
it
is
well
known
to
medical
men
that
nearly
all
medicines
belonging
to
the
class
of
alteratives
are
capable
of
solution
in
the
gastric
and
intestinal
secretions
and
pass
without
material
change
by
the
process
of
absorption
through
the
coats
of
the
stomach
and
intestines
as
do
all
liquids
and
so
gain
an
entrance
into
the
general
circulation
that
these
same
alteratives
act
locally
to
tone
and
strengthen
the
mucous
surfaces
and
thus
promote
and
rectify
the
process
of
digestion
before
being
absorbed
that
alterative
medicines
when
in
the
blood
must
permeate
the
mass
of
the
circulation
and
thus
reach
the
remote
parts
of
the
body
and
influence
every
function
that
these
medicines
while
in
the
blood
may
combine
with
it
reconstruct
it
and
arrest
its
morbid
tendencies
to
decomposition
we
should
use
those
alteratives
which
give
tone
to
the
digestive
and
nutritive
functions
in
order
to
curtail
the
constant
propagation
of
scrofula
in
the
system
which
alter
and
purify
the
blood
through
the
natural
functions
thus
reconstructing
it
and
which
check
the
septic
changes
which
are
evinced
by
the
irritating
and
poisonous
matter
discharged
from
the
ulcers
these
are
the
three
ways
in
which
medicines
operate
upon
the
nutritive
functions
and
the
blood
thus
alteratives
may
be
specifics
in
so
far
as
they
are
particularly
useful
in
certain
disorders
and
the
combination
which
has
been
made
in

excels
all

we
do
not
confine

we
adjust

the
appliances
required
in

are
numerous

of

of

all
taken

the
general
directions

many
cases
that

under

merely
say
for

the
afflicted
that

this
medicine
old
sores
chronic
ulcers
under
this
head
we
may
properly
consider
that
class
of
affections
known
as
ulcers
etc
these
sores
have
common
characteristics
yet
each
possesses
certain
peculiarities
which
have
led
to
their
division
into
and
these
peculiarities
are
not
constant
one
form
of
ulcer
often
changing
into
another
one
feature
common
to
all
however
is
their
slowness
in
healing
which
has
sometimes
led
to
the
belief
that
they
are
incurable
another
popular
notion
is
that
their
cure
is
detrimental
to
the
health
of
the
patient
with
equal
propriety
we
might
say
that
it
is
dangerous
to
cure
diarrhea
dysentery
consumption
or
cancer
as
a
result
of
these
erroneous
impressions
many
people
suffer
from
chronic
ulcers
for
years
and
even
for
a
without
attempting
to
obtain
relief
chronic
ulcers
usually
appear
upon
the
lower
extremities
the
depth
and
appearance
of
the
ulcer
depend
upon
its
character
and
the
thickness
of
the
tissues
where
it
is
situated

the
irritable
ulcer
is
painful
and
tender
the
slightest
injury
causing
it
to
bleed
it
is
of
a
dark
purplish
hue
and
filled
with
spongy
sensitive
granulations
it
discharges
a
thin
bloody
matter
which
is
sometimes
very
fetid
and
acrid
and
excoriates
the
tissues
if
it
comes
in
contact
with
them
the
edges
of
this
species
of
ulcer
are
and
ragged
and
turn
inward
the
adjacent
structures
are
red
and
swollen
very
often
they
are
attended
by
severe
constitutional
disturbances
such
as
chills
fever
and
great

irritability
in

years
varicose

this
species
of
ulcer
occasions
a
swollen
or
enlarged
condition
of
the
neighboring
veins
which
are
very
much
enfeebled
it
almost
invariably
appears

be
either
indolent

may
often

skin
as
we
have
before
remarked
these
various
species
of
ulcers
are
merely
modifications
of
one
form
of
chronic
sore
the
patient
may
assert
that
he
enjoys
excellent
health
but
if
we
question
him
closely
we
find
that
the
sore
irritates
him
and
that
there
is
sufficient
constitutional
disturbance
to
prevent
the
healing
powers
of
nature
from
effecting
a
cure
treatment
the
cure
of
these
sores
is
necessarily
slow
and
who
ever
expects
to
obtain
relief
will
be
disappointed
constitutional
treatment
is
of
the
utmost
importance
and
should
therefore
be
thoroughly
and
persistently
applied
the
nutritive
system
especially
the
absorbents
should
be
kept
active
as
these
are
the
channels
by
which
the
tissue
surrounding
the
sore
is
replaced
by
that
of
a
higher
grade
of
vitality
for
this
purpose
the
best
alteratives
or
blood
cleansing
remedies
are
required
if
secretion
and
excretion
are
not
normally
performed
the
blood
becomes
poisoned
by
the
absorption
of
unhealthy
matter
from
the
sore
and
various
constitutional
disturbances
occur
if
at
any
time
during
treatment
constitutional
disturbances
are
manifested
by
fullness
or
disagreeable
sensations
in
the
head
nausea
pain
cough
chills
or
fever
a
thorough
cathartic
should
be
given
if
the
patient
be
robust
a
repetition
of
the
same
once
a
week
will
be
very
beneficial
golden
medical
discovery
and
pellets
will
be
productive
of
the
best
results
the
local
treatment
should
depend
upon
the
character
of
the
ulcer
if
the
sore
be
or
painful
soothing
applications
such
as
warm
poultices
or
steaming
in
a
vapor
of
bitter
herbs
as
hops
boneset
or
or
water
pepper
will
be
found
highly
beneficial
a
poultice
of
powdered
slippery
elm
is
also
very
soothing
and
hence
well
adapted
to
this
purpose
if
the
ulcer
be
a
stimulating
application
is
necessary
the
hardened
callous
state
of
the
edges
should
be
removed
by
alkaline
applications
a
strong
solution
of
saleratus
or
even
a
caustic
prepared
by
boiling
the
lye
from
ashes
to
the
consistence
of
syrup
will
prove
of
great
utility
one
or
two
applications
of
the
latter
are
generally
sufficient
the
foregoing
course
of
treatment
is
intended
to
put
the
open
sore
or
ulcer
in
what
is
known
to
surgeons
as
a
healthy
condition
a
condition
most
favorable
for
the
healing
process
but
the
open
surface
of
the
sore
needs
something
more
it
needs
the
cleansing
or
antiseptic
and
soothing
influence
of
such
a
dressing
as
is
found
in
pierce

your

all

the
surgeon
must
exercise
great
judgment
carelessness
may
prolong

and
subsequently
necessitate
another
operation
or
perhaps
an
amputation
usually
the
dead
bone
is
easily
removed
by
the
skilled
specialist
surgeon
and
when
thoroughly
taken
out
the
parts
readily
heal
and

rapidly
recovers
the
removal
therefore
of
the
dead
bone
which
is
a
constant
source
of
irritation

of
protracted
suffering
should
not
be
delayed
for
very
rarely
indeed
can
it
be
removed
at
all
without
the
assistance
of
the

besides
delay
often
results
in

which
was
accompanied

all
over

hurt
me
very

very
thankful
to
you
for
curing
me
the
medicines
which
i
used
for
two
months
only
have
effected
a
perfect

cure
of

case
my
face
looks
as
well
as
ever
i
was
six
weeks
under
treatment
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
and
i
got
accommodation
the
case
was
a
strange
one
the
pimples
did
not
break
out
on
my
chin
where
i
had
let
my
beard
grow
they
broke
out
on
my
cheeks
forehead
and
nose
a
doctor
in

francisco
told
me
it
was
blood
poison
and
said
it
was
very
hard
to
cure
it
i
think
if
it
were
blood
poison
it
would
run
all
through
my
system
when
i
first
felt
the
disease
coming
on
in

my
face
used
to
be
very
cold
i
worked
under

fourteen
years
every
summer
i
wore
no
hat
nothing
but
a
skull
cap
i
thought
i
was
the
doctor
in
san
francisco
stopped
the
disease
for
one
year
but
it
came
back
again
i
had
it
for
five
years
it
came
on
from
hard
work
and
exposure
in
the
sun
when
my
face
would
break
out
in
the
fall
it
got
so
itchy
and
then
little
pimples
would
break
out
on
my
face
nose
and
forehead
i
think
parasites
were
in
my
face
if
i
would
drink
a
glass
of
beer
i
would
feel
the
effects
of
it
in
my
face
and
tobacco
would
affect
me
just
the
same
my
face
nose
and
forehead
would
be
spotted
all
over

note
book
every

for
five
years
i
never

like

i
would

my
baby
when
about
three
months
old
began
to
have
little
sores
come
out
on
his
face
did
not
amount
to
much
until
six
months
old
then
they
began
to
spread
all
over
his
face
and
head
until
his
face
head
and
ears
were
one
solid
sore
our
family
physician
was
summoned
at
the
early
stages
of
the
disease
and
tried
everything
he
knew
of
for
the
cure
of
the
same
but
nothing
did
him
any
good
the
disease
baffled
the
skill
of
the
doctor
in
every
way
and
i
was
advised
by
friends
to
try
certain
remedies
which
i
did
with
very
little
effect
the
child
by
this
time
was
a
sight
to
behold
and
suffered
unknown
agonies
with
the
torturing
itching
and
burning
of
the
sores
and
so
things
ran
on
until
my
brother
who
resides
in
buffalo
visited
me
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
child
he
advised
me
to
have
him
treated
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
in
buffalo
i
wrote
to
them
stating
my
baby
case
asking
them
if
they
could
help
him
and
they
thought
they
could
so
began
their
treatment
at
once
by
using
salves
externally
and
medicine
internally
and
as
soon
as
they
began
their
treatment
the
child
began
to
improve
and
continued
so
until
he
was
entirely
cured
in
six
months
time
he
is
now
two
years
and
six
months
old
and
is
as
tough
as
any
child
you
ever

which
soon
caused
her
to
have
high

we
employed
some
of
the
best
physicians
in

who
pronounced
it
rheumatism
did
everything
for

they
could
do
but
she
kept
getting
worse
from
day
to
day
and
in
about
five
weeks
after
she
was
first
taken
sick
her
ankles

legs
came
open
and
discharged
a
lot
of
yellow
matter
and
finally
slivers
of
bones
came
out
of
the
openings
in
her
ankles
all
the
doctors
we
consulted
said
that
we
would
have
to
have
an
operation
performed

have
the
dead
bones
taken
out

the
dead
bones
would
come
out
and
be
replaced
with
new
ones
for
the
dead
pieces
would
brake
loose
from
the
sound
bone
and
come
out
through
the
opening
with
the
matter
but
he
could
not
do
anything
to
improve
her
health
after
doctoring
her
three
months
she
was
reduced
to
a
mere
skeleton
and
had
to
be
tended
to
like
a
mere
baby
and
have
her
feet
elevated
or
else
she
would
scream
with
pain
we
commenced
giving
her
pierce

after
using
it
for
one
month
we
could
see
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
getting
no
worse
and
after
using
about
five
bottles
her
health
began
to
improve
a
little
but
she
still
suffered
with
pain
and
could
not
have
her
feet
down
until
she
had
taken
twelve
bottles
when
she
had
taken
fifteen

she
began
to
walk
on
crutches
and
later
with
a
cane
for
about
two

three
months
when
she
could
walk
without

the

thick
neck
goitre
thick
neck
or
goitre
also
sometimes
called
bronchocele
consists
of
an
enlargement
of
the
thyroid
gland
which
lies
over
and
on
each
side
of
the
trachea
or
windpipe
between
the
prominence
known
as
adam
apple
and
the
breast
bone
the
tumor
gradually
increases
in
front
and
laterally
until
it
produces
great
deformity
and
often
interferes
with
respiration
and
the
act
of
swallowing
from
its
pressure
on
the
great
running
to
and
from
the
head
there
is
a
constant
liability
to
engorgement
of
blood
in
the
brain
and
to
apoplexy
epilepsy
etc
when
the
enlargement
once
makes
its
appearance
it
continues
to
increase
in
size
as
long
as
the
person
lives
unless
appropriate
treatment
be
resorted
to
it
never
disappears
spontaneously
these
tumors
are
much
larger
than
those
not
familiar
with
them
would
suppose
from
their
outward
appearance
as
they
extend
under
and
are
bound
down
by
the
muscles
on
each
side
of
the
neck
so
that
they
become
embedded
in
the
cellular
tissues
underneath
while
the
sides
of
the
neck
retain
to
a
considerable
extent
their
round
and
even
appearance
whereby
the
real
magnitude
of
the

in

the

it

fig
the
causes
of
the
affection
are
not
well
understood
the
use
of
or
water
impregnated
with
some
particular
saline
or
calcareous
matter
has
been
assigned
as
a
cause
it
has
also
been
attributed
to
the
use
of
water
in
which
there
is
not
a
trace
of
iron
iodine
or
bromine
a
writer
in
a
swiss
journal
d
states
that
the
disease
is
often
due
to
an
impeded
circulation
in
the
large
veins
of
the
neck
from
pressure
of
the
clothing
or
from
the
head
being
bent
forward
a
position
which
is
often
seen
in
school
children
when
the
muscles
of
the
back
of
the
neck
have
become
fatigued
treatment
we
have
obtained
wonderful
results
by
a
new
method
of
treatment
which
consists
in
the
employment
of
electrolysis
in
conjunction
with
other
therapeutic
means
there
is
scarcely
a
case
in
which
this
treatment
properly
carried
out
will
not
effect
a
radical
cure
it
is
attended
with
no
danger
whatever
those
who
are
afflicted
with
this
disease
and
unable
to
avail
themselves
of
special
treatment
can
not
do
better
than
to
take
alterative
extract
or
golden
medical
discovery
and
apply
to
the
skin
over
and
around
the
tumor

and
morning
the

parotitis
this
is
an
inflammation
of
the
parotid
glands
and
generally
occurs
in
childhood
it
is
often
epidemic
and
is
manifestly
contagious
it
usually
though
not
always
appears
on
both
sides
of
the
neck
at
the
same
time
symptoms
an
external
movable
swelling
just
below
and
in
front
of
the
ear
near
the
angle
of
the
jaw
is
the
prominent
symptom
the
enlargement
is
not
circumscribed
but
hard
and
painful
and
attended
with
more
or
less
fever
derangement
of
the
secretions
and
difficulty
in
swallowing
the
swelling
increases
until
the
fourth
and
fifth
day
when
it
gradually
diminishes
and
by
the
eighth
or
tenth
is
entirely
gone
sometimes
the
disease
is
accompanied
by
swelling
of
the
breasts
in
the
female
or
the
testicles
in
the
male
treatment
usually
but
little
treatment
is
necessary
exposure
to
cold
should
be
avoided

severe
or
painful

febrile
symptoms
a
hot
and
small
doses
of
the
compound
extract
of
in
some
diaphoretic
infusion
to
induce
sweating
together
with
small
doses
of
aconite
will
produce
good
results
if
swelling
of
the
testicles
threatens
which
seldom
happens

on

influenza
or
la
grippe
this
is
an
infectious
disease
characterized
by
depression
and
usually
associated
with
a
catarrhal
condition
of
the
mucous
membrane
it
may
affect
the
respiratory
organs
or
the
intestinal
canal
there
is
a
marked
liability
to
serious
complications
of
which
pneumonia
is
the
most
dangerous
the
disease
is
evidently
due
to
a
specific
virus
of
great
infectiveness
and
is
more
active
and
contagious
at
certain
seasons
and
under
certain
conditions
of
the
atmosphere
by
some
it
has
been
supposed
that
it
is
due
to
a
miasma
in
the
air
but
the
character
of
its
infection
indicates
that
the
true
virus
is
of
a
germinal
nature
uncomplicated
cases
recover
but
in
the
aged
and
in
the
delicate
we
may
see
fatal
results
due
usually
to
the
profound
depression
or
the
high
temperature
to
which
the
individual
is
subjected
there
is
much
redness
and
swelling
of
the
mucous
membranes
of
the
nose
and
throat
a
bronchitis
and
a
catarrhal
state
of
the
stomach
and
intestines
these
may
all
be
present
or
the
disease
may
center
upon
one
particular
portion
of
the
animal
economy
and
manifest
its
ravages
there
alone
symptoms
the
attack
usually
resembles
an
ordinary
catarrh
of
cold
in
some
cases
the
nasal
catarrh
is
absent
or
very
mild
and
the
infection
invades
the
general
system
with
much
fever
a
very
striking
manifestation
of
the
disease
is
the
severe
nervous
troubles
which
are
present
at
the
outset
consisting
of
headache
pain
in
the
back
and
legs
and
a
general
soreness
of
the
muscles
and
bones
as
if
bruised
or
beaten
the
pulse
is
usually
feeble
and
small
intermittent
the
disease
may
center
in
the
brain
producing
delirium
mental
disorders
are
not
uncommon
and
there
is
usually
following
the
disease
more
or
less
inaptitude
for
mental
work
and
a
tendency
to
depression
of
spirits
in
many
cases
there
is
a
severe
diarrhea
and
the
individual
suffers
much
from
pain
and
discomfort
in
the
abdomen
this
is
a
irritation
and
apparently
favors
an
early
recovery
and
usually
there
are
less
severe
sequels
in
such
cases
the
most
dangerous
complication
is
pneumonia
these
cases
may
follow
bronchitis
or
the
grip
may
begin
with
symptoms
of
this
disease
for
which
see
the
chapters
upon

cases
complicated
with

are
the
most
indefinite
in
their
symptoms
and
require
the
closest
attention
treatment
in
every
case
the
disease
must
be
regarded
as
a
dangerous
one
and
the
patient
be
confined
to
bed
and
indoors
until
all
fever
has
disappeared
otherwise
sudden
and
serious
manifestations
are
liable
to
appear
at
any
time
the
patient
must
be
well
fed
and
nourished
from
the
outset
the
bowels
should
be
acted
upon
by
mild
laxatives
such
as
castor
oil
or
pierce
pleasant
pellets
using
from
one
to
three
it
is
also
of
advantage
afterward
to
move
them
twice
each
day
by
the
injection
of
warm
water
to
which
has
been
added
a
teaspoonful
of
table
salt
to
each
pint
this
injected
into
the
rectum
using
the
water
slightly
tepid
or
cool
if
the
patient
is
feverish
will
tend
to
soften
the
actions
from
the
bowels
and
favor
the
escape
of
poisonous
matter
the
cool
water
has
also
a
soothing
effect
upon
the
fever
and
nervous
system
if
the
fever
is
high
and
there
is
delirium
small
doses
of
aconite
with
water
should
be
used
every
half
hour
or
hour
but
all
depressing
agents
of
this
kind
must
be
used
with
caution
as
profound
prostration
sometimes
develops
warm
baths
repeated
frequently
and
followed
by
hot
lemonade
are
of
the
greatest
benefit
in
reducing
the
feverish
condition
and
quieting
the
patient
the
bed
should
be
warmed
after
these
are
administered
and
the
patient
given
hot
lemonade
to
bring
on
free
action
of
the
skin
kidneys
and
bowels
where
the
pulse
is
weak
the
free
use
of
stimulants
as
wine
coffee
tea
and
brandy
or
whiskey
are
required
as
the
great
danger
of
the
disease
is
a
depression
of
the

and
other
complications

be
applied

the

frequent
cause
of

is
an

weakness
which
frequently
may
be
associated

giving
to
the

a

in
this
condition
it
is
useless
for
the
sufferer
to
endeavor
to
clear
the

this
only
tends
to
render
a

pressing
the

it
introduce
the
nozzle
at
the
end
of
the

into
one
nostril
pressing
it
in

is
elevated
so
as
to
completely
close
the
passage
into
the
throat
and
thus
the
fluid
is
made
to
flow
up
one
nostril
in
a
gentle
stream
to
pass
into
and
thoroughly
cleanse
all
the
sinuses
or
cavities
connected
with
the

and
to
flow

up
the

not
work
properly
unless

flows
fill
the
reservoir
a
second
time
with
the
simple
salt

water
and
inserting
the
nozzle
into
the
nostril
out
of
which
the
fluid
flowed
on
using
it
the
first
time
pass
the
current
through
in
the
opposite
direction
that
is
so
that
it
will
flow
out
of
the

into
which
it
flowed
the
first
time

warmed
to
a
moderate
temperature
and
pass
this
through
the
nose
in
the
same
manner
as
directed
for
the
salt
water
the
salt
water
is
not
curative
but
is
milder
than
simple
water
and
is
therefore
preferable
for
cleansing
the
passages
on
first
commencing
the
use
of
the
instrument
it
is
best
to
hang
it
only
a
very
little
higher
than
the
forehead
but
after
using
it
a
few
times
put
it
up
about
as
high
as
the
length
of
the
tube
will
admit
let
no
one
entertain
any
feeling
of
timidity
on
commencing
the
use
of
this
instrument
as
its
operation
is
perfectly
simple
and
harmless
and
with
the
fluids
which
we
recommend
is
never
attended
with
any
strangling
choking
pain
or
other
disagreeable
sensations
the
medicine
should
be
applied
with
the
douche
at
least
twice
a
day
in
the
morning
and
at
night
on
retiring
there
is
no
advantage
in
using
the
medicine
oftener
than
three
times
a
day
when
used
with
the
instrument
but
a
quantity
should
be
used
each
time
to
medicate
all
the
diseased
parts
if
any
remains
in
the
douche
it
may
be
poured
back
into
the
stock
solution
for
subsequent
use
but
a
liquid
that
has
once
passed
through
the
nasal
cavity
contains
the
germs
of
the
disease
and
must
not
be
used

nasal
polypus
the
term
nasal
polypus
is
usually
given
to
a
variety
of
growths
which
are
met
with
in
the
nasal
passages
far
more
frequently
than
any
other
tumors
they
are
thus
designated
because
of
their
fancied
resemblance
to
the
aquatic
polypus
they
occur
singly
or
in
clusters
as
illustrated
in
fig
in
the
early
stages
the
mucous
membrane
is
swollen
and
irregularly
dilated
presenting
a
rough
and
mottled
appearance
not
unlike
chronic
catarrh
with
which
they
are
usually
associated
gradually
these
tumors
enlarge
usually
becoming
pendulant
and
presenting
a
grayish
opaque
glistening
surface
similar
to
the
pulp
of
a
grape
occasionally
they
become
massive
at
the
point
of
attachment
and
assimilate
a
warty
or
cauliflower
growth
the
latter
variety
is
better
supplied
with
blood
vessels
and
presents
a
red
or
dark
pink
surface
and
may
bleed
on
slight
irritation
the
favorite
location
is
beneath
or
behind
the
middle
or
superior
turbinated
bodies
oftentimes
nearly
or
quite
concealed
however
no
portion
of
the
mucous
membrane
lining
the
upper
air
passages
is
exempt
sometimes
they
grow
from
the
roof
of
the
nostril
and
pharnyx
in
pendulous
masses
assuming
the
shape
of
the
cavities
filling
the
entire
nostril
and
upper
portion
of
pharnyx
the
mucous
membrane
covering
the
turbinated
bodies
may
become
dilated
and
swollen
finally
developing
by
catarrhal
processes
into
a
polypus

with
chronic

catarrh
and
frequent
attacks
of

symptoms
these
may
vary
considerably
in
different
cases
due
to
the
character
and
location
of
the
polypus
in
the
early
stages
before
the

is
well
developed
the
symptoms
may
be
those
of

diagnosis
of
polypus

a
skillful
specialist
neither

the
polypus

the
nasal
discharge
is
generally
increased

cause
a
sense
of
fullness
and
weight
between

with
more
or

headache
and
facial
neuralgia
there
is
partial

cases
the

with

upon

at

many
times

many
cases
have

heroic
method
of
seizing
the
polypus
with
a

tearing
it
loose
bringing
with
it
segments
of
healthy
tissue
leaving
bone
exposed
and
a
ragged
uneven
surface
of
diseased
membrane
it
is
much
easier
to
properly
treat
a
case
from
the
beginning
than
to
undertake
it
in
such
a
rendition
owing
to
the
fact
that
these
nasal
tumors
grow
directly
from
the
lining
membranes
it
is
necessary
not
only
to
thoroughly
remove
the
tumor
but
to
treat
the
diseased
membrane
at
the
point
from
which
the
polypus
springs
otherwise
another
tumor
may
develop
at
the
same
point
the

having
been
thoroughly
anæsthetized

see
fig
p
often
the
attachment
of
the
growth
is
entirely
hidden
behind
the
irregular
bony
structures
of
the
nostril
so
that
it
requires
the
skill
of
an
expert
specialist
deft
in
the
manipulation
of
these

many

are

to
completely
remove
the

without
doing

by

operation
the
tumor
is
at
once
removed
without
pain
and
with
the
loss
of
only
a
few
drops
of

further
because
the

is
entirely
removed
and
the

properly
treated
there
is
not
the

and
the
danger
from

and
to
which
the

is
subjected
in
other
forms
of
treatment
in
conclusion
we
would
say
that
we
claim
for
our
operation
the
following
points
that
are
worthy
of
the
careful
consideration
of
every
one
who
may
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
require
the
services
of
a
specialist
for
the
removal
of
growths
in
the
nasal
or
upper
air
passages
our
operation
is
absolutely
painless
no
chloroform
or
ether
is
required
we
insure
perfect
removal
of
growth
there
is
no
injury
to
other
adjacent

the
operation
is
bloodless
the
recovery
is
rapid
there
is
no
slough
to
produce
pus
that
may
be
absorbed
and
cause
deformity
of
the
nasal
septum
in
health
the
nasal
septum
is
a
bony
or
cartilaginous
plate
as
shown
in
fig
dividing
the
nasal
passages
into
two
cavities
of
the
same
size
and
shape
this
plate
or
partition
is
also
a
support
to
which
the
flexible
structures
which
form
the
tip
of
the
nose
are
attached
in
early
life
the
septum
is
flexible
and
may
be
bent
or
doubled
by
injury
to
the
nose
but
owing
to
its
elasticity
usually
resumes
its
natural
position
and
shape
after
maturity
any
dislocation
or
change
in
this
bony
plate
usually
remains
permanent
unless
some
means
are
employed
for
its
correction
in
a
limited
number
of
cases
supposed
to
be
chronic
nasal
catarrh
we
have
found
upon
examination
that
one
or
both
nasal
cavities
were
more
or
less
obliterated
and
obstructed
by
the
deformed
and
thickened
septum
see
fig
many
of
these
cases
date
from
an
injury
to
the
external
parts
causing
only
bleeding
from
the
nose
and
a
slight
pain
for
a
short
time
chronic
inflammation
develops
at
the
point
where
the
bone
is
bent
or
cracked
resulting
in
thickening
often
producing
nodules
or
projections
which
not
only
interfere
with
nasal
breathing
but
also
act
as
irritants
to
the
adjacent
delicate
membranes
and
produce
many
of
the
symptoms
common
to
nasal
catarrh

cases
the

appears
to
be
bent

side
in
the
earlier
stages
there
is
an
excess
of
mucous
secretion
often
dropping
into
the
throat
from

the

is
variable

the

the

is
to
extend
backward
often
causing
headache
deafness
roaring
in
the
ears
and
disease
which
results
in
a
chronic

the
latter
disease
often
being
the
one
for
which
the

we
are
now
able
to
produce
such
local
anæsthesia
as
to
render
the

entirely
painless
without
the
administration
of
either
chloroform
or

this
is
an
important
consideration
as
many
are
adverse
to
taking
chloroform

and
now
that
we
possess
an
agent
that
produces
locally
complete

we
are
very
glad
to
dispense

many

very
annoying
and
even

and
sometimes
unsatisfactory

rendered
entirely
painless
and
carried
out
with
a
thoroughness
that
would
be
impossible
without
the
use
of
this
wonderful

not
only
in

our

anæsthetic
we
regard
it
as
a

never

the

idea
of

may
be
formed

we
consider
that
of
the
entire
population
of
the
globe
one
in
every
three
hundred
and
persons
annually
dies
of
consumption
it
may
not
be
definitely
known

what
proportion
of
all
the
deaths
in
this
country
and
europe
occurs
from
this
one
disease
those
who
have
gathered
statistics
differ
somewhat
some
claiming
while
others
put
the
ratio
at
and
even
as
low
as
a
fair
estimate
and
one
probably
very
near
the
truth
would
be
or
of
the
whole
number
in

for
five
consecutive

the
proportion
was

about
twenty
thousand

to
this
destroyer
and
in
the
state
of
new

as
many
more
these
figures
may
appear
to
be
exaggerations
but
investigations
of
the
subject
prove
them
to
be
the
simple
truth
epidemics
of
cholera
yellow
fever
and
other
diseases
of
similar
character
so
terrible
in
their
results
occasion
alarm
and
receive
the
most
careful
considerations
for
their
prevention
and
cure
while
consumption
receives
scarcely
a
thought
yet
the
number
of
their
victims
sinks
into
insignificance
when
compared
with
those
of
consumption
like
the
thief
in
the
night
it
steals
upon
its
victim
unawares
in
a
large
proportion
of
cases
its
approach
is
so
insidious
that
the
early
symptoms
are
almost
wholly
disregarded
indeed
they
excite
but
little
if
any
attention
and
perhaps
for
a
time
disappear
altogether
thus
the
patient
suspicions
if
they
have
been
aroused
are
allayed
and
appropriate
measures
for
his
relief
are
discontinued
this
may
be
the
case
until
renewed
attacks
firmly
establish
the
disease
and
before
the
patient
is
fully
aware
of
the
fatal
tendency
of
his
malady
he
is
progressing
rapidly
towards
that
bourne
from
which
no

the

invalids
are
seldom
willing

they

attributed
nature
of

is
an
error
to
suppose
that
the
disease
under

is
confined
to
the
lungs
pulmonary
consumption
as
has
been
remarked
is
but
a
of
a
great
constitutional
malady
the
lungs
are
merely
the
stage
where
it
plays
its
most
conspicuous
part
every
part
of
the
system
is
more
or
less
involved
every
vital
operation
more
or
less
deranged
especially
is
the
function
vitiated
and
imperfect
the
circulation
is
also
involved
in
the
general
morbid
condition
tubercles
which
constitute
a
marked
feature
of
the
disease
are
composed
of
unorganized
matter
deposited
from
the
blood
in
the
tissue
of
the
lungs
they
are
small
globules
of
a
yellow
opaque
friable
substance
of
about
the
consistency
of
cheese
after
their
deposition
they
are
increased
in
size
by
the
accretion
of
fresh
matter
of
the
same
kind
they
are
characteristic
of
all
forms
of
scrofulous
disease
the
most
plausible
theory
in
regard
to
them
is
that
they
are
the
result
of
imperfect
nutrition
such
a
substance
can
not
be
produced
in
the
blood
when
this
fluid
is
perfectly
formed
it
is
an
unorganized
particle
of
matter
resulting
from
the
imperfect
elaboration
of
the
products
of
digestion
which
is
not
therefore
properly
fitted
for
assimilation
with
the
tissues
the
system
being
unable
to
appropriate
it
and
powerless
to
cast
in
off
through
the
excretory
channels
deposits
it
in
the
lungs
or
other
parts
of
the
body
there
it
remains
as
a
foreign
substance
like
a
splinter
or
thorn
in
the
flesh
until
ejected
by
suppuration
and
sloughing
of
the
surrounding
parts
it
might
be
supposed
by
some
that
when
the
offending
matter
was
thus
eliminated
from
the
lungs
they
would
heal
and
the
patient
recover
but
unfortunately
the
deposition
of
tubercular
matter
does
no
cease
owing
to
the
morbid
action
of
the
vital
forces
it
is
formed
and
deposited
as
fast
or
faster
than
it
can
be
thrown
off
by
expectoration
hence
arises
the
remarkable
fatality
of
pulmonary
consumption
causes
the
causes
of
consumption
are
numerous
and
varied
but
may
all
be
classed
under
two
heads
viz
or
and
or
of
just
what
tubercular
matter
consists
is
still
a
subject
of
controversy
but
that
its
existence
depends
upon
certain
conditions
either
or
is
generally
conceded
and
one
of
these
conditions
is
impaired
vitality
constitutional
predisposition
must
first
give
rise
to
conditions
which
will
admit
of
the
formation
of
tubercular
matter
before
any
cause
whatever
can
occasion
its
local
deposition
it
must
modify
the
vitality
of
the
whole
system
when
other
causes
may
determine
in
the
system
thus
impaired
the
peculiar
morbid
action
of
which
tubercular
matter
is
the
product
the
general
division
of
causes
into
predisposing
and
exciting
must
ever
be
more
or
less
arbitrary
individuals
subject
to
predisposing
causes
may
live
the
natural
term
of
life
and
finally
die
of
other
disease
indeed
when
predisposing
causes
are
known
to
exist
they
should
constitute
a
warning
for
the
avoidance
of
other
causes
again
among
the
exciting
causes
some
may
operate
in
such
a
manner
with
some
individuals
as
to
predispose
them
to
consumption
and
the
result
will
be
the
same
as
if
the
disposition
had
been
congenital
the
causes
which
in
one

circumstances
and
in
other
individuals
would
be
because
they
act
so
as
to
depress
the
vitality
and
impair
the
nutritive
processes
the
predisposing
causes
then
are
hereditary
predisposition
scrofula
debility
of
the
parents
climatic
influences
sedentary
habits
depressing
emotions
in
fact
which
impairs
the
vital
forces
and
interferes
with
the
perfect
elaboration
of
nutritive
material
the
exciting
causes
are
those
which
are
capable
of
arousing
the
predisposing
ones
into
activity
and
which
in
some
instances
may
themselves
induce
predisposition
as
dyspepsia
nasal
catarrh
colds
suppressed
menstruation
bronchitis
retrocession

tight

fast

and
impurity
and
impoverishment
of
blood
from
any
cause
this
list
might
be
greatly
extended
but
the
other
causes
are
generally
in
some
manner
allied
to
those
already
named
symptoms
the
symptoms
of
consumption
vary
with
the
progress
of
the
disease
writers
generally
recognize
three
stages
which
so
gradually
change
from
one
to
the
other
that
a
dividing
line
can
not
be
drawn
as
the
disease
progresses
new
conditions
develop
which
are
manifested
by
new
symptoms
prior
to
the
advent
of
pulmonary
symptoms
is
the
latent
period
which
may
extend
over
a
variable
length
of
time
from
a
few
months
to
several
years
and
indeed
may
never
be
developed
any
farther
until
sufficient
tubercular
matter
has
been
deposited
in
the
lungs
to
alter
the
sounds
observed
on
auscultation
and
percussion
a
definite
diagnosis
of
tubercular
consumption
can
not
be
made
even
though
there
may
have
been
hemorrhage
nevertheless
when
we
find
emaciation
accelerated
and
difficult
breathing
increased
frequency
of
the
pulse
an
increase
of
and
coming
on
gradually
without
any
apparent
cause
we
have
sufficient
grounds
for
grave
suspicions
these
are
increased
if
tenderness
under
the
with
a
slight
hacking
cough
is
present
these
symptoms
should
be
sufficient
to
warn
any
individual
who
has
the
slightest
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
disposed
to
consumption
to
lose
no
time
in
instituting
the
appropriate
hygienic
and
medical
treatment
for
it
is
at
this
stage
that
remedies
will
be
found
most
effective
unfortunately
this
period
is
too
apt
to
pass
unheeded
or
receive
but
trifling
attention
the
patient
finds
some
trivial
excuse
for
his
present
condition
and
believes
that
he
will
soon
be
well
but
alas
for
his
anticipations
the
disease
goes
onward
and
onward
gradually
gaining
ground
from
which
it
will
be
with
great
difficulty
dislodged
the
cough
now
becomes
sufficiently
harassing
to
attract
attention
and
is
generally
worse
in
the
morning
the
expectoration
is
slight
and
frothy
the
pulse
varies
from
ninety
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
beats
in
a
minute
and
sometimes
even
exceeds
this
flushes
of
heat
and
a
burning
sensation
on
the
soles
of
the
feet
and
palms
of
the
hands
are
experienced
a
circumscribed
redness
of
one
or
both
cheeks
is
apparent
these
symptoms
increase
in
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
are
followed
by
a
sense
of
chilliness
more
or
less
severe
the
appetite
may
be
good
even
voracious
but
the
patient
remarks
that
his
food
does
not
seem
to
do
him
any
good
and
to
use
a
popular
expression
he
is
going
into
a
decline
as
the
strength
wanes
the
cough
becomes
more
and
more
severe
as
if
occasioned
by
a
fresh
cold
in
which
way
the
patient
vainly
tries
to
account
for
it
expectoration
increases
becomes
more
opaque
and
perhaps
yellow
with
occasionally
slight
dots
or
streaks
of
blood
the
fever
increases
and
there
is
more
pain
and
oppression
of
the
chest
particularly
during
deep
respiration
after
exercise
palpitation
is
more
severe
there
may
now
be
tire
patient
waking
in
the
morning
to
find
himself
drenched
in
perspiration
exhausted
and
haggard
bleeding
from
the
lungs
occurs
and
creates
alarm
and
astonishment
often
coming
on
suddenly
without
warning
the
hemorrhage
usually
ceases
spontaneously
or
on
the
administration
of
proper
remedies
and
in
a
few
days
the
patient
feels
better
than
he
has
felt
for
some
time
previously
the
cough
is
less
severe
and
the
breathing
less
difficult
indeed
a
complete
remission
sometimes
occurs
and
both
patient
and
friends
deceive
themselves
with
the
belief
that
the
afflicted
one
is
getting
well
after
an
indefinite
length
of
time
the
symptoms
return
with
greater
severity
these
remissions
and
aggravations
may
be
repeated
several
times
each
successive
remission
being
less
perfect
each
recurrence
more
severe
carrying
the
patient
further
down
the
road
toward
the
dark
valley
now
the
cough
increases
the
paroxysms
become
more
severe
the
expectoration
more
copious
and
purulent
as
the
tubercular
deposits
soften
and
break
down
the
voice
is
hollow
and
reverberating
the
chest
is
flattened
and
loses
its
mobility
the
are
prominent
with
marked
depression
above
and
below
auscultation
reveals
a
bubbling
gurgling
sound
as
the
air
passes
through
the
matter
in
the
bronchi
with
the
click
to
the
air
cells
beyond
percussion
gives
a
dull
sound
or
if
there
are
large
cavities
it
is
hollow
and
auscultation
elicits
the
amphoric
sound
as
of
blowing
into
a
bottle
hectic
fever
is
now
fully
established
the
eye
is
unusually
bright
and
pearly
with
dilated
pupils
which
gives
a
peculiar
expression
the
paroxysms
of
coughing
exhaust
the
patient
and
he
gasps
and
pants
for
breath
the
tongue
now
becomes
furred
the
patient
thirsty
the
bowels
constipated
and
all
the
functions
are
irregularly
performed
another
remission
may
now
occur
and
the
patient
be
able
to
resume
light
employment
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
which
we
have
known
to
extend
over
three
or
four
years
when
the
symptoms
again
return
if
the
patient
is
a
female
and
deranged
or
suppressed
menstruation
has
not
marked
the
accession
of
pulmonary
symptoms
the
flow
now
becomes
profuse
and
clotted
or
is
scanty
and
colorless
sometimes
ceasing
altogether
in
the
male
the
sexual
powers
diminish
and
copulation
is
followed
by
excessive
and
prostration
from
this
time
onward
the
progress
of
the
disease
is
more
rapid
the
liver
and
kidneys
are
implicated
in
addition
to
the
pallor
the
complexion
becomes
jaundiced
giving
the
patient
who
is
now
wasting
to
a
mere
skeleton
a
ghastly
look
the
urine
is
generally
copious
and
limpid
though
occasionally
scanty
and
yellow
the
pulse
increases
to
one
hundred
and
thirty
or
one
hundred
and
forty
beats
in
the
minute
and
is
feeble
and
the
cough
harasses
the
patient
so
that
he
does
not
sleep
or
his
rest
is
fitful
and
unrefreshing
whenever
sleep
does
occur
the
patient
wakes
to
find
himself
drenched
with
a
cold
clammy
perspiration
the
throat
mouth
and
tongue
now
become
tender
and
occasionally
ulcerate
expectoration
is
profuse
purulent
and
viscid
clinging
tenaciously
to
the
throat
and
mouth
and
the
patient
no
longer
has
strength
to
eject
it
the
hair
now
falls
off
the
nails
become
livid
and
the
breathing
difficult
and
gasping
the
patient
has
no
longer
strength
to
move
himself
in
bed
and
has
to
be
propped
up
with
pillows
and
suffocates
on
assuming
the
recumbent
position
drinks
are
swallowed
with
difficulty
diarrhea
takes
the
place
of
constipation
the
extremities
are
cold
swollen
and
dropsical
the
voice
feeble
hollow
grating
husky
the
patient
gasping
between
each
word
the
respiration
is
short
and
quick
a
slight
remission
of
these
symptoms
occurs
the
patient
is
more
comfortable
lively
cheerful
and
perhaps
forms
plans
for
the
future
but
it
is
the
last
effort
of
expiring
vitality
the
last
flicker
of
the
lamp
of
life
the
candle
burns
brilliantly
for
a
moment
and
with
one
last
effort
goes
out
and
death
closes
the
scene
the
duration
of
the
active
stage
of
consumption
varies
from
a
few
weeks
to
several
years
the
average
time
being
about
eighteen
months
is
always
a
prominent
symptom
throughout
the
entire
course
of
the
disease
varying
with
its
progress
at
first
scanty
then
slightly
increased
colorless
frothy
and
mucous
is
also
a
characteristic
after
a
time
it
becomes
opaque
yellow
and
more
or
less
watery
then
and
finally
purulent
copious
and
viscid
when
tubercular
matter
is
freely
expectorated
with
but
little
mucus
it
sinks
in
water
this
symptom
continues
to
the
very
last
bleeding
from
the
lungs
may
occur
at
any
stage
of
the
disease
often
being
the
first
pulmonary
symptom
noticed
again
being
delayed
until
late
and
there
are
cases
in
which
it
does
not
happen
at
all
it
seldom
occurs
in
any
other
disease
may
occur
at
any
stage
though
they
are
rarely
experienced
until
the
disease
is
pretty
well
established
and
are
very
exhausting
generally
occurs
soon
after
the
pulmonary
symptoms
are
developed
and
increases
in
intensity
with
the
progress
of
the
disease
there
are
usually
two
paroxysms
in
hours
one
of
which
occurs
towards
evening
and
is
followed
by
difficult
breathing
is
at
first
slight
except
after
exertion
amounting
to
only
a
sense
of
oppression
but
it
becomes
more
and
more
severe
as
the
disease
advances
until
the
very
last
when
it
is
agonizing
in
the
extreme
sometimes
extending
to
the
pharynx
and
larynx
generally
occurs
towards
the
last
the
mouth
and
throat
become
so
very
sore
and
tender
that
nourishment
and
medicine
are
taken
with
difficulty
and
are
characteristic
of
the
disease
they
fluctuate
as
the
disease
advances
or
is
retarded
increasing
to
the
very
last
and
constitute
valuable
means
of
diagnosis
from
the
time
tubercular
matter
begins
to
be
deposited
to
the
very
last
and
when
correctly
practiced
reveal
the
extent
and
progress
of
the
disease
as
a
knowledge
of
the
sounds
elicited
can
only
be
acquired
by
practical
experience
with
proper
instruments
they
will
not
be
described
here
the
only
diseases
with
which
consumption
is
likely
to
be
confounded
are
general
debility
in
the
early
stage
bronchitis
chronic
pleurisy
chronic
pneumonia
and
abscess
in
the
lungs
after
the
advent
of
pulmonary
symptoms
curability
notwithstanding
the
prevailing
opinion
that
consumption
is
incurable
there
exists
ample
incontrovertible
evidence
to
the
contrary
its
curability
is
established
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
individuals
have
recovered
in
whom
there
was
extensive
destruction
of
pulmonary
tissue
and
indeed
entire
destruction
of
one
lung
numerous
instances
are
on
record
in
which
persons
have
suffered
from
all
the
symptoms
of
confirmed
consumption
and
have
regained
their
health
and
subsequently
died
of
other
diseases
the
case
of
the
late
joseph
parish
of
philadelphia
affords
a
striking
example
of
this
kind
in
early
life
he
manifested
all
the
symptoms
of
confirmed
consumption
including
frequent
hemorrhages
yet
he
fully
regained
his
health
and
after
a
very
useful
life
died
at
an
advanced
age
of
another
disease
examination
revealed
the
existence
of
cicatrices
or
scars
in
his
lungs
where
tubercular
matter
had
been
deposited
wood
in
his
practice
of
medicine
mentions
another
instance
of
a
medical
gentleman
in
philadelphia
who
in
early
life
suffered
from
consumption
with
hæmoptysis
from
which
he
recovered
and
afterwards
died
at
an
advanced
age
of
typhoid
fever
when
the
knife
revealed
the
presence
of
cicatrices
examinations
of
individuals
who
have
died
of
other
diseases
have
revealed
in
numerous
instances
the
presence
of
consumption
at
some
period
of
their
existence
in
these
cases
the
lungs
were
perfectly
healed
by
cicatrization
or
by
the
deposit
of
a
chalky
material
a
french
physician
made
examinations
of
one
hundred
women
all
of
whom
were
over
sixty
years
of
age
and
who
had
died
of
other
diseases
and
in
fifty
of
them
he
found
evidences
of
the
previous
existence
of
consumption
professor
flint
says
that
consumption
sometimes
terminates
in
recovery
and
that
his
observations
lead
him
to
the
conclusion
that
the
prospect
of
recovery
is
more
favorable
in
cases
characterized
by
frequent
hemorrhages
drs
ware
and
walshe
are
also
led
to
the
same
conclusion
professor
hughes
bennett
of
edinburgh
has
thoroughly
investigated
the
subject
and
adds
his
testimony
to
that
of
others
citing
numerous
cases
that
have
resulted
in
perfect
recovery
if
such
testimony
is
not
sufficient
we
may
mention
the
following
whose
names
are
well
known
and
respected
in
professional
circles
and
all
of
whom
declare
that
consumption
is
a
curable
disease
the
list
includes
laennec
andral
cruveilhier
kingston
presat
rogée
boudet
and
a
host
of
others
no
farther
back
than
on
page
of
the
proceedings
of
the
connecticut
medical
society
we
find
observations
and
upon
the
case
of
the
late
president
day
by
hubbard
new
haven
from
which
we
learn
that
jeremiah
day
ll
who
was
for
years
president
of
yale
college
was
while
a
mere
youth
a
victim
of
pulmonary
consumption
during
his
infancy
and
boyhood
his
vitality
was
feeble
he
entered
yale
college
as
a
student
in
but
was
soon
obliged
to
leave
the
institution
on
account
of
pulmonary
difficulty
which
was
doubtless
the
incipient
stage
of
the
organic
disease
of
the
lungs
which
subsequently
developed
itself
he
remained
in
feeble
health
for
two
years
but
returned
to
college
and
graduated
in
for
the
next
six
years
his
lung
difficulties
were
quite
severe
and
he
repeatedly
bled
in
large
quantities
but
he
had
so
far
recovered
in
as
to
accept
a
professorship
he
was
afterwards
chosen
president
of
the
college
which
office
he
held
for
many
years
in
the
enjoyment
of
good
health
he
died
from
old
age
as
we
are
told
in
aged
years
statistics
show
that
under
the
improved
methods
of
treating
this
disease
the
mortality
as
compared
with
previous
years
has
been
greatly
reduced
clinical
observation
proves
that
injuries
to
the
lungs
are
not
so
fatal
as
was
once
supposed
treatment
the
earlier
the
treatment
of
this
disease
is
undertaken
the
greater
is
the
probability
of
success
the
reason
of
this
is
obvious
at
first
the
disease
is
general
or
constitutional
but
as
it
advances
by
the
deposit
of
it
becomes
both
constitutional
and
local
hence
the
treatment
must
be
both
and
the
occurrence
of
certain
prominent
and
distressing
symptoms
either
from
the
natural
progress
of
the
disease
or
from
complications
with
other
affections
often
renders
it
difficult
even
for
physicians
to
determine
how
far
their
treatment
should
be
general
and
how
far
local
treating
the
symptoms
instead
of
the
general
disease
or
treating
the
constitutional
disease
without
regard
to
the
symptoms
which
arise
from
it
is
an
error
into
which
many
physicians
have
fallen
the
constitutional
affection
the
local
manifestations
and
complications
and
the
circumstances
and
individual
peculiarities
of
the
patient
must
all
be
carefully
considered
bearing
in
mind
all
the
while
that
tubercular
matter
is
the
product
of
a
morbid
action
which
in
every
case
must
exist
before
its
deposition
in
the
lungs
or
any
other
tissue
can
take
place
in
every
case
in
which
curative
treatment
is
to
be
instituted
the
hearty
and
persistent
of
both
patient
and
friends
is
absolutely
necessary
and
the
treatment
which
is
both
hygienic
and
medical
in
character
should
have
in
view
the
following
aims
the
avoidance
of
the
causes
concerned
in
the
production
and
perpetuation
of
the
disease
the
restoration
of
healthy
nutrition
in
order
to
stop
the
formation
of
tuberculous
matter
the
arrest
of
the
abnormal
breaking
down
of
the
tissues
and
the
prevention
of
emaciation
the
relief
of
local
symptoms
and
the
complications
arising
from
other
diseases
the
fulfillment
of
the
first
indication
the
avoidance
of
causes
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
if
they
have
been
sufficient
to
the
disease
their
continued
operation
must
certainly
be
sufficient
to
it
a
single
individual
is
very
often
subjected
to
the
operation
of
several
of
the
causes
already
enumerated
some
of
which
in
consequence
of
circumstances
and
surroundings
are
unavoidable
of
these
the
one
most
difficult
to
overcome
is
climate
the
frequent
variations
of
temperature
upon
the
subject
of
climate
much
has
been
written
but
that
which
is
best
adapted
to
the
cure
of
consumption
is
that
which
will
enable
the
patient
to
pass
a
certain
number
of
hours
every
day
in
the
pure
open
air
without
exposure
to
sudden
alterations
of
temperature
there
are
very
few
persons
who

shall
be
maintained
at
the
highest
standard

it

food
of

character
is
apt

increase
acidity
and
interfere

therefore
articles
rich

matters
should
enter
largely
into

the
articles
of

are

beef
game

fowls
these
contain
the
necessary

oily
food
is
of
great
importance
and
the
beef
eaten
should
contain
a
good
proportion
of

plenty
of
salt
should
always
be
eaten
with
the
food

the

third
indication

which
is
to
check
the
abnormal

waste
of

which
constitute
such
a
prominent
feature
in

the

manifested
in
preventing
such
abnormal

the
emaciation
excessive

profuse
perspiration
diarrhea
and
hectic

common

are
all
due

of
the

it
is
in
this
condition
of
the
system
that
this
medicine
by
its
powerful
antiseptic
properties
manifests
its
most
wonderful
curative
ability
when
as
in

the
vital
forces
of
the

have
in
a
degree
lost
their
restraining
influence
over
the
processes
of

waste
and
decay
which
goes
on
so
rapidly
that
nutrition
can
not
compensate
for
the
loss

then
it

that
the

by
its
antiseptic
influence
checks
this

arrests

to
the
lack

the
unparalleled
fatality
of

is
largely
due
in
their
anxiety
to
improve

and
thus
build
up

physicians
often
lose
sight
of
the
no

important
indication
of

the
destructive
waste
going
on
in
the
system
which
overbalances
the
supplies
furnished

have
been
employed
to
a
great
extent
and
the
theories
which
have
been
advanced
in
favor
of

use
are
sometimes
very
ingenious
that
they
modify
the
cough
we
do
not

to
deny

it

great
expense

passed
in
copious
quantities
this
symptom
indicates
great
excitement
of
the
nervous
system
the
voice
is
hoarse
articulation
difficult
breathing
limited
noisy
and
wheezy
the
is
pathognomonic
of
the
disease
it
can
only
be
confounded
with
croup
and
then
only
in
the
young
in
croup
there
is
pain
and
difficulty
in
swallowing
fever
and
cough
which
are
usually
absent
in
asthma
a
severe
paroxysm
of
asthma
is
very
distressing
to
witness
and
one
unused
to
it
might
well
suppose
the
sufferer
to
be
in
his
last
agonies
no
definite
limit
can
be
assigned
to
the
duration
of
the
attack
or
of
the
disease
it
may
last
but
a
few
minutes
may
endure
for
hours
or
with
slight
remission
continue
for
days
the
condition
of
the
patient
may
be
for
years
as
changeable
as
the
pointings
of
the
in
fact
the
atmosphere
has
much
to
do
with
the
disease
with
every
approaching
storm
with
every
cloud
of
dust
even
the
dust
from
sweeping
a
room
with
every
foul
odor
and
in
some
more
sensitive
organizations
with
even
the
perfume
of
flowers
a
paroxysm
is
provoked
truly
he
is
a
child
of
circumstances
a
veritable
football
upon
the
toes
of
every
atmospheric
disturbance
unparalleled
success
persons
affected
with
asthma
or
phthisic
are
numerous
with
such
an
amount
of
suffering
in
our
midst
is
it
not
a
marvel
if
not
a
disgrace
that
the
medical
profession
of
endorse
the
opinions
of
a
half
century
ago
and
pronounce
it
incurable
rather
than
make
stupendous
and
laudable
efforts
to
discover
plans
of
medication
that
will
result
in
certain
and
permanent
cure
almost
single
handed
we
undertook
this
field
of
investigation
and
we
take
pleasure
in
reporting
that
our
labors
have
been
crowned
with
success
the
large
experience
furnished
us
has
led
to
the
discovery
of
remedies
for
this
distressing
malady
of
more
than
ordinary
efficacy
through
the
agency
of
these
means
we
have
been
enabled
to
cure
hundreds
who
had
suffered
untold
tortures
for
twelve
fifteen
or
years
some
whom
we
have
been
successful
in
curing
had
suffered
from
childhood
to
middle
and
even
old
age
the
treatment
of
asthma
or
phthisic
still
continues
to
be
a
prominent

at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
nature
of
the
disease
as
to
the
exact
pathological
condition
in
this
malady
opinions
differ
some
physicians
consider
it
a
disease
of
the
nervous
system
others
of
the
blood
others
of
the
bronchial
tubes
while
not
a
few
believe
it
to
be
dependent
upon
some
disease
of
the
stomach
heart
liver
kidneys
or
due
to
urinary
affections
or
female
weakness
respecting
all
these
diseases
of
special
organs
it
is
evident
that
any
complication
and
particularly
one
that
is
debilitating
or
causes
irritation
of
the
nervous
system
will
increase
its
severity
this
important
fact
we
keep
constantly
in
view
in
our
treatment
and
prescribe
remedies
to
remove
all
complications
in
heart
disease
there
is
often
dyspnoea
or
difficult
breathing
but
this
is
not
of
the
nature
of
asthma
or
phthisic
the
condition
of
the
lungs
is
readily
understood
there
being
an
obstruction
to
the
free
passage
of
the
blood
through
the
heart
any
excessive
muscular
exertion
or
anything
in
fact
which
increases
the
action
of
the
heart
is
very
apt
to
produce
congestion
of
the
lungs
and
then
the
blood
becomes
surcharged
with
carbonic
acid
which
causes
increased
efforts
to
take
more
air
into
the
lungs
a
nervous
disease
a
sudden
fright
unfavorable
news
grief
loss
of
property
circumstances
which
affect
the
mind
and
nervous
system
almost
invariably
throw
the
phthisical
into
a
paroxysm
nervines
are
demanded
particularly
if
the
case
be
a
chronic
one
and
we
see
that
they
are
carefully
and
properly
prepared
and
supplied
and
in
such
a
form
as
to
be
exactly
fitted
to
the
temperament
and
constitution
popular
remedies
used
for
of
asthma
there
are
numerous
remedies
that
may
be
used
to
of
asthma
among
them
we
will
notice
a
few
that
are
most
frequently
employed
by
the
profession
they
can
be
easily
and
inexpensively
prepared
by
any
patient
or
druggist
equal
parts
of
the
tinctures
of
lobalis
capsicum
and
skunk
cabbage
root
take
a
half
teaspoonful
in
a
little
water
every
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
until
relieved
this
is
an
antispasmodic
and
relaxant
in
considerable
quantities
it
will
produce
sickness
at
the
stomach
and
perhaps
vomiting
it
should
not
be
used
when
there
is
disease
of
the
heart
chloroform
a
small
quantity
say
thirty
drops
may
be
poured
upon
a
handkerchief
or
napkin
held
about
one
inch
from
the
nostrils
and
the
vapor
inhaled
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
use
this
until
insensibility
follows
in
fact
such
an
effect
would
be
hazardous
to
life
in
the
hands
of
the
inexperienced
sulphuric
ether
the
same
as
no
and
with
the
same
precaution
either
of
them
should
be
used
promptly
upon
the
beginning
of
the
paroxysm
take
four
ounces
of
stramonium
leaves
and
strip
from
the
stems
rubbing
between
the
hands
to
partly
pulverize
to
this
add
one
ounce
of
saltpetre
finely
powdered
place
a
half
teaspoonful
upon
a
very
hot
shovel
inhale
the
rising
smoke
if
the
first
few
inspirations
cause
coughing
the
smoke
should
not
be
evaded
as
the
coughing
incites
deeper
inspiration
stramonium
and
saltpetre
as
in
no
dampen
with
water
and
make
into
balls
or
cones
these
are
more
easily
handled
and
are
fired
in
the
same
way
as
the
powder
and
used
in
the
same
way
take
of
sunflower
leaves
stramonium
leaves
mullein
leaves
one
ounce
each
of
lobelia
leaves
half
an
ounce
of
powdered
nitre
one
ounce
and
benzoic
acid
two
drams
mix
thoroughly
a
pipeful
to
be
smoked
the
same
as
tobacco
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
or
several
of
hot
water
this
is
especially
effective
in
cases
arising
from
checked
perspiration
from
rheumatism
etc
these
recipes
are
given
to
the
public
as
being
the
principal
agents
employed
by
the
medical
profession
throughout
the
world
it
must
be
distinctly
understood
that
they
are
not
but
merely
and
used
to
relieve
paroxysms
we
object
to
them
wholly
and
unqualifiedly
because
they
contain
narcotics
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
in
our
treatment
not
to
use
this
class
of
remedies
they
stupefy
the
brain
debilitate
the
nervous
system
and
have
in
not
a
few
instances
formed
an
unfortunate
appetite
and
habit
most
difficult
to
overcome
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
one
of
the
chief
reasons
why
this
malady
has
been
considered
incurable
is
the
fact
that
physicians
have
almost
universally
relied
upon
narcotic
drugs
with
such
medication
a
cure
is
the
exception
a
cure
can
only
be
effected
under
such
circumstances
when
the
of
nature
are
sufficient
to
overcome
both
narcotic
disease
that
they
will
we
do
not
deny
but
will
never
it
reminds
us
of
an
old
country
doctor
who
advised
a
lady
to
smoke
tobacco
to
cure
acid
dyspepsia
she
followed
the
prescription
for
over
thirty
years
and
at
last
accounts
was
not
cured
yet
in
all
seriousness
we
ask
would
any
other
remedy
except
a
narcotic
or
stimulant
be
used
with
such
persistency
for
anything
like
this
length
of
time
is
it
not
apparent
that
such
agents
form
a
habit
which
is
often
worse
than
the
disease
and
yet
fail
to
effect
a
cure
we
appreciate
the
necessity
for
relief
and
do
not
blame
sufferers
for
availing
themselves
of
any
means
for
this
purpose
but
they
should
not
be
satisfied
with
relief
only
but
should
look
about
for
such
a
system
of
medication
as
will
rid
them
of
the
disease
completely
and
permanently
if
a
week
or
a
month
exemption
is
a
foretaste
of
heaven
how
incomparable
are
the
comforts
and
happiness
to
be
derived
from
a
immunity
millions
of
dollars
are
annually
spent
upon
the
advice
of
physicians
in
traveling
expenses
and
hotel
bills
by
sufferers
from
asthma
or
phthisic
in
seeking
a
change
of
climate
that
will
be
advantageous
it
is
the
last
expedient
of
the
doctor
who
is
annoyed
by
the
continued
complaint
of
his
unrelieved
patient
and
can
only
be
made
available
by
the
wealthy
in
some
instances
the
change
is
beneficial
but
to
be
effectually
so
a
permanent
change
of
residence
is
required
most
patients
are
unable
or
unwilling
to
do
this
in
some
cases
change
only
affords
temporary
relief
the
attacks
returning
after
a
few
months
even
the
wealthy
dislike
to
take
such
chances
the
less
opulent
can
not
think
of
such
methods
and
hence
are
compelled
to
bear
their
sufferings
as
best
they
can
in
the
majority
of
instances
the
change
of
climate
is
only
an
illusion
or
only
temporarily
beneficial
at
best
we
can
tell
them
a
better
way
and
if
they
are
wise
they
will
follow
it
hay
asthma
or
hay
fever
this
affection
known
also
as
hay
catarrh
hay
fever
or
rose
cold
differs
but
little
in
its
manifestations
from
coryza
or
cold
in
the
head
save
in
its
and
in
its
element
of
periodicity
in
this
latitude
there
are
persons
who
during
summer
or
early
fall
are
invariably
attacked
with
acute
congestion
or
inflammation
of
the
upper
giving
rise
to
sneezing
watery
discharges
from
the
nose
and
eyes
difficult
respiration
fever
and
general
prostration
these
symptoms
are
supposed
to
be
induced
by
the
inhalation
of
pollen
or
odors
from
grasses
or
flowers
which
at
that
time
are
supposed
to
give
off
certain
exhalations
of
an
irritating
character
unless
arrested
by
medical
treatment
the
disease
lasts
until
cool
weather
or
the
occurrence
of
a
hard
frost
rids
the
atmosphere
of
the
exciting
influence
some
feather
beds
give
off
an
odor
which
excites
all
the
aggravated
symptoms
of
this
disease
thus
it
appears
that
certain
emanations
have
the
power
of
inciting
these
inflammatory
conditions
in
certain
sensitive
constitutions
in
all
individuals
suffering
from
this
disease
there
is
an
over
sensitiveness
of
the
nervous
system
which
admits
of
the
appearance
of
such
sudden
and
severe
manifestations
many
cases
suffering
only
mild
symptoms
for
the
first
few
seasons
annually
become
aggravated
until
severe
spasmodic
asthma
is
a
regular
and
sometimes
continuous
complication

on

the
remedy
is
best
applied
with

when
the

has
existed

is
necessary
that
the
patient
begin
both
constitutional
and
local
treatment
four
or
six
weeks
prior
to
an
expected
return
of
the
disease
the
nervous
system
should
be
strengthened
and
the
resistance
of
the
patient
to
the
irritating
influence
of

pollens

so
increased
that
even
though
he
may
be
exposed
no

follow
pierce

will
be
found
invaluable
as
an
alterative

nerve
tonic
and
should
be
taken
regularly
while
sage

remedy
is
being
used
locally
for
its
antiseptic
and
curative
properties
the
action
of

is
especially
desired
in
cases
that
are
so
far
advanced
as
to
be
attended
with
asthmatic
symptoms
such
as
difficult
breathing
headache
and
a
feeling
of
lassitude
and
prostration
in
very
obstinate
or
distressing
cases
our
specialists
have
been
able
to
prescribe
and
send
by
mail
or
express
special
courses
of
treatment
which
have
proven
so
effective
as
to
cure
the
disease
so
that
it
has
not
reappeared
the
following
season
the
treatment
seems
to
have
produced
such
an
impression
upon
the
system
as
to
have
fortified
the
individual
against
a
return
of
the
disease
in
rare
cases
morbid
growths
in

of
such
a
nature
as
in

to
be
a

of

so
that

is
thus
rendered
more
susceptible
to
this

in
such
or
exceedingly
obstinate

for

you
recommend
it
in
the

of

took
a

which
settled
on

and
i
suffered
intensely
with
it
i
tried
several
of

here
and
they
gave
up
all
hopes
of
my
recovery
and
my

thought
i
would
have

die
and
i
thought
so
myself
as
the
doctors
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
me
in
the

on
rising
i
would
cough

spit
blood
for

i
would
try
the

as
it
was
so
highly
recommended
i
was
greatly
discouraged
when

began
the

after
i
had
taken
four
or
five
bottles
i
then
noticed
i
was
getting
better
and
i
could
stand
it
to
work
some
and
kept
on
taking
it
till
i
took
about
twenty
or
bottles
it
has
been
five
years
since
i
took
it
and
have
had
no
return
of
that

since
i
gladly

know
it

my
wife
a
few
years
ago
had
hemorrhages
of
the
lungs
and
we
summoned
our
home
physician
he
checked
the
hemorrhage
but
failed
to
cure
her
she
had
also
a
terrible
cough
and
expectorated
a
great
deal
she
wanted
to
see
another
doctor
so
i
called
one
and
he
examined
her
she
asked
him
whether
she
had
consumption
and
his
answer
was
madam
it
is
very
near
consumption
he
advised
her
to
use
cod
liver
oil
but
this
gave
but
little
relief
i
happened
to
get
hold
of
one
of
your
little
books
that
comes
with
each
bottle
of
pierce
medicines
and
i
read
some
cases
about
like
my
wife
i
went
to
the
drug
store
and
procured
a
bottle
of
pierce
golden
medical
discovery
and
my
wife
commenced
using
it
according
to
directions
she
began
to
get
better
right
away
and
her
cough
has
left
her
she
used
about
ten
bottles
she
is
in
her
year
and
can
walk
ten
or
twelve
miles
without
any
trouble
we
are
satisfied
that
her
life
and
health
have
been
saved
by
the
use
of
golden
medical
discovery
as
soon
as
she
takes
any
cold
she
insists
upon
having
a
bottle
of
her
medicine
as
she
calls
it
and
that
is
the
last
we
hear
of
her
cold

i
am
years
old
during
the
winter
of
i
contracted
a
severe
cold
which
settled
on
my
lungs
each
succeeding
winter
my
cough
grew
worse
and
in
the
winter
of
i
had
and
taking
cold
drove
them
in
causing
me
a
severe
spell
of
sickness
the
following
summer
i
had
congestion
of
the
lungs
and
hemorrhage
and
a
severe
spell
of
fever
my
physician
advised
me
to
go
west
in
search
of
health
my
friends
thought
i
had
consumption
of
the
lungs
i
coughed
so
much
in
september
i
left
carthage
mo
where
i
then
lived
for
phoenix
after
i
had
been
there
about
four
months
i
had
a
severe
attack
of
and
with
this
i
coughed
myself
almost
i
thought
to
death
and
to
add
to
my
distress
i
had
an
almost
intolerable
attack
of
pleurisy
a
doctor
was
summoned
and
after
an
examination
said
i
had
empyemia
and
said
he
could
do
me
but
very
little
good
until
he
removed
the
pus
he
and
his
partner
came
and
by
the
use
of
an
aspirator
drew
off
nine
pints
of
pus
after
about
a
week
he
drew
off
two
pints
after
a
few
days
i
told
my
doctor
i
could
hear
the
pus
gurgle
as
i
had
before
he
drew
it
off
strange
to
say
but
nevertheless
true
my
heart
was
crowded
over
on
the
opposite
side
for
three
months
i
knew
it
was
there
for
i
could
feel
the
pulsations
there
and
i
was
so
short
of
breath
for
a
long
time
i
could
not
stoop
down
to
tie
my
shoes
the
doctor
told
me
it
would
be
useless
again
to
use
the
aspirator
but
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
make
an
incision
in
my
side
and
treat
it
till
i
got
well
on
the
day
of
march
my
doctor
and
his
partner
and
three
other
doctors
undertook
the
operation
and
after
removing
about
two
inches
of
one
of
my
ribs
withdrew
pints
of
pus
this
came
near
being
too
much
for
me
though
i
slowly
recovered
and
in
three
months
the
doctors
thought
i
was
able
to
come
home
i
arrived
home
in
june
and
was
very
poorly
all
summer
and
did
not
sit
up
but
and
had
fever
every
day
in
the
latter
part
of

of

commenced

side
had
been
discharging
for
months
it
healed
up
sound
and
well
i
am
now
able
to
do
considerable

i
would
advise
all

are

some
years
since
i
was
feeling
very
miserable
all
summer
i
was
very
bilious
sometimes
my
bowels
would
not
move
once
in
sixty
or
seventy
hours
and
then
almost
impossible
i
would
take
some
bitters
which
would
help
to
move
the
matter
but
as
soon
as
the
bitters
were
gone
i
had
to
buy
more
or
i
would
be
as
bad
as
before
and
sometimes
worse
but
none
of
them
appeared
to
do
me
any
good
except
to
move
the
bowels
until
thirty
years
since
a
druggist
called
my
attention
to
pierce
golden
medical
discovery
and
before
i
had
taken
half
a
bottle
of
the
golden
medical
discovery
i
felt
much
better
and
by
the
time
i
had
taken
all
i
could
eat
three
hearty
meals
per
day
and
had
not
felt
so
well
for
a
long
time
soon
after
i
was
called
to
do
a
job
some
miles
from
home
and
one
night
the
old
lady
there
was
speaking
about
her
daughter
brooks
who
had
been
under
the
doctor
care
for
five
months
and
did
not
get
any
better
and
i
learned
by
asking
a
few
questions
that
she
had
no
appetite
and
no
ambition
to
do
anything
then
i
told
her
what
the
golden
medical
discovery
had
done
for
me
the
next
day
the
old
lady
drove
down
to
her
daughter
and
got
brooks
to
send
to
rutland
ten
miles
away
for
two
bottles
of
the
golden
medical
discovery
and
the
next
day
the
doctor
came
and
when
about
to
take
leave
brooks
told
the
doctor
he
did
not
want
him
any
more
at
present
and
would
send
for
him
if
necessary
i
saw
the
old
lady
about
ten
days
later
and
her
daughter
was
improving
and
brooks
had
great
faith
in
the
golden
medical
discovery
and
had
not
sent
for
the
doctor
but
had
gone
to
rutland
for
more
of
the
when
i
commenced
taking
the
golden
medical
discovery
i
thought
i
was
going
into
consumption
as
had
a
cough
for
three
years
or
more
and
my
weight
decreasing
my
weight
before
taking

in
the

of

became
irregular
in
my
monthly
courses
of
course
at
first
i
paid
but
little
attention
to
it
hoping
it
would
amount
to
nothing
and
probably
wear
away
but
i
slowly
but
surely
grew
worse
and
at
last
resolved
to
apply
to
the
doctors
for
help
my
water
came
often
and
in
small
quantities
and
with
great
pain
and
with
red

i
was
attacked
with
severe
womb
trouble
bloody
piles

dropsy
of
the
ovary
i
was
treated
by
five
different
doctors
i
was
compelled
to
wear
an
inside
support
for
a
year
but
it
still
seemed
impossible
for
me
to
get
well
and
i
began
to
feel
exceedingly
alarmed
and
very
uneasy
not
knowing
what
course
to
pursue
or
what
the
consequences
might
be
i
had
heard
of
pierce
and
concluded
to
make
one
more
trial
so
i
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
him
stating
matters
as
near
as
i
could
and
in
due
time
i
received
a
favorable
reply
then
i
commenced
with
his
medicine
i
commenced
somewhere
in
february
with
the
golden
medical
discovery
and
favorite
prescription
in
alternate
doses
a
strange
occurrence
followed
my
limbs
felt
like
what
we
call
asleep
and
i
felt
as
if
i
were
in
a
strange
land
and
wondered
what
was
going
to
take
place
i
kept
on
till
i
took
nine
bottles
the
first
relief
i
felt
was
from
sick
headache
which
i
had
been
troubled
with
for
many
years
i
was
also
cured
of
a
very
bad
cough
which
i
had
been
troubled
with
for
many
years
and
of
dyspepsia
of
long
standing
i
was
entirely
cured
of
a
very
singular
and
severe
itching
on
my
back
between
my
shoulders
which
our
doctor
called
winter
itch
and
which
they
pronounced
incurable
i
had
suffered
with
this
for
twenty
years
it
would
come
in
the
winter
and
go
away
in
the
summer
i
was
also
cured
of
the
worst
form
of
bloody
piles
and
of
womb
disease
at
present
i
feel
like
a
new
person
when
i
first
commenced
with
pierce
medicines
i
could
not
walk
half
a
mile
without
a
pain
the
other
day
i
walked
to
mercersburgh
a
distance
of
twelve
miles
and
the

day
walked
back
again

my
heartfelt
thanks
to
you
for
the
wonderful
cure
that
your
special
remedies
performed
in
my
case
in
the
spring
of
i
had
a
severe
attack
of
la
grippe
which
left
me
in
bad
shape
i
consulted
as
good
a
physician
as
there
was
in
the
county
and
he
told
me
that
i
was
suffering
from
enlargement
of
the
heart
and
that
i
must
be
very
careful
about
taking
any
violent
exercise
and
i
must
not
allow
myself
to
get
excited
as
excitement
of
any
kind
might
prove
fatal
he
gave
me
remedies
for
my
trouble
which
made
me
feel
some
better
but
being
a
farmer
i
was
obliged
to
work
hard
and
soon
began
to
run
down
i
began
to
have
spells
of
a
terribly
deathly
sinking
feeling
at
my
stomach
and
a
terrible
pressure
at
the
heart
in
the
region
of
the
heart
and
sometimes
i
would
fall
prostrate
and
although
i
was
conscious
all
the
time
i
could
not
speak
aloud
the
last
of
october
while
doing
my
chores
in
the
morning
i
had
one
of
those
bad
spells
and
upset
my
lantern
which
resulted
in
my
losing
my
buildings
by

my
wife
was
out

that
time
she
too
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of

having
lost
everything
eatable
for
ourselves

stock
i
was
forced
to
work
very
hard
to
get
through
the
winter
the
next
february
we
had
another
attack
of
la
grippe
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
my
beloved
wife
the
next
may
this
terrible
affliction
together
with
hard
work
completely
broke
me
down
and
although
i
was
doctoring
all
the
time
i
kept
steadily
growing
worse
i
got
so
bad
that
i
could
not
sleep
more
than
two
or
three
hours
any
night
and
very
often
i
would
go
all
night
without
closing
my
eyes
at
all
the
last
of
september
i
had
to
give
up
work
almost
entirely
i
got
so
that
i
not
walk
of
a
mile
without
being
completely
one
physician
whom
i
consulted
said
i
was
suffering
with
nervous
prostration
and
gave
me
medicine
for
it
but
i
got
no
better
my
food
distressed
me
terribly
and
after
eating
it
would
sour
and
i
would
have
to
vomit
up
the
most
that
i
had
eaten
at
last
i
got
so
i
had
to
live
on
bread
made
of
wheat
middlings
and
for
about
three
months
i
could
not
eat
anything
else
although
it
seemed
as
though
i
should
starve
to
death
i
thought
i
would
give
anything
if
i
could
eat
a
hearty
meal
of
anything
that
i
wanted
but
did
not
dare
to
because
every
kind
of
food
distressed
me
so
my
bowels
became
badly
constipated
and
for
three
months
i
did
not
have
a
natural
operation
of
the
bowels
and
i
suffered
very
much
with
catarrh
and
there
was
such
a
pressure
across
my
forehead
that
it
seemed
sometimes
as
though
it
would
burst
i
became
very
despondent
i
did
not
want
to
go
anywhere
neither
did
i
want
to
see
any
one
everything
looked
dark
and
gloomy
to
me
when
well
i
was
naturally
or
a
lively
disposition
and
a
great
hand
to
joke
with
my
friends
but
no
one
could
say
anything
funny
enough
to
get
a
smile
out
of
me
then
i
was
always
very
fond
of
music
too
but
i
could
not
bear
to
hear
a
bit
of
music
neither
vocal
nor
instrumental
about
the
first
of
february
some
of
my
friends
prevailed
upon
me
to
consult
a
physician
who
made
a
specialty
of
treating
chronic
nervous
troubles
he
said
i
had
no
organic
trouble
of
the
heart
and
that
it
was
caused
by
my
stomach
being
out
of
order
he
said
that
i
had
a
bad
kidney
trouble
and
that
my
spine
was
affected
and
that
unless
i
got
help
it
would
end
in
locomotor
ataxia
he
said
he
could
help
me
but
it
would
probably
take
a
year
to
cure
me
he
let
me
have
a
month
treatment
and
gave
me
advice
in
regard
to
diet
etc
i
thought
for
awhile
that
it
was
helping
me
but
soon
i
began
to
go
down
hill
again
and
as
a
last
resort
i
began
to
take
some
of
the
patent
with
which
the
country
is
flooded
but
i
soon
became
disgusted
with
them
and
made
up
my
mind
there
was
no
help
for
me
i
had
to
use
about
all
the
strength
i
had
to
walk
i
could
not
lift
my
left
foot
up
to
step
over
anything
had
to
draw
it
after
me
i
could
hardly
sleep
neither
could
i
transact
any
business
in
fact
i
did
not
take
any
interest
in
any
of
my
affairs
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
i
did
not
have
a
friend
on
earth
and
i
longed
for
death
to
come
to
put
me
out
of
my
misery
my
son
with
whom
i
was
living
had
been
trying
for
a
long
time
to
get
me
to
send
to
you
for
treatment
but
i
had
paid
out
so
much
money
and
received
no
benefit
from
it
that
i
did
not
believe
there
was
any
help
for
me
at
last
i
thought
i
would
write
you
what
i
could
of
my
symptoms
and
get
your
opinion
of
my
case
but
it
took
me
about
two
days
to
write
the
letter
my
head
felt
so
bad
that
i
could
not
collect
myself
enough
to
describe
my
feelings
you
wrote
me
that
my
trouble
was
caused
by
indigestion
dyspepsia
catarrh
and
spinal
affection
and
that
you
could
cure
me
and
in
fact
make
a
new
man
of
me
if
i
would
send
for
your
special
treatment
and
follow
your
advice
my
son
sent
for
the
medicine
for
me
i
took
it
and
followed
your
directions
as
near
as
i
could
the
first
week
i
could
not
see
much
of
any
change
the
second
week
i
could
see
that
i
was
improving
some
the
third
week
i
could
look
back
and
see
that
i
had
gained
considerable
i
could
sleep
better
the
bloating
in
my
bowels
did
not
trouble
me
so
bad
my
stomach
did
not
distress
me
so
much
and
i
could
eat
different
kinds
of
food
and
my
digestion
seemed
to
be
improving
fast
and
by
using
your
special
catarrh
remedy
my
nose
began
to
run
it
had
been
nearly
six
months
that
my
nose
was
perfectly
dry
and
one
day
it
felt
as
though
something
gave
way
in
my
head
it
seemed
to
be
back
in
behind
my
eyes
and
i
blowed
a
large
amount
of
filth
out
of
my
head
that
looked
like
the
yolk
of
an
egg
and
it
was
nearly
as
thick
as
jelly
after
that
my
head
began
to
improve
rapidly
and
i
began
to
gain
in
flesh
and
strength
and
the
best
of
all
is
i
have
kept
right
on
gaining
until
at
the
present
time
feel
as
well
as
i
ever
did
in
my
sleep
well
can
eat
three
hearty
meals
every
day
and
digest
them
too
and
eat
anything
i
want
and
seven
days
in
a
week
to
look
back
now
i
do
see
why
i
did
not
apply
to
you
when
i
was
first
taken
sick
for
about
ten
years
ago
i
had
treatment
of
you
for
catarrh
liver
and
kidney
trouble
and
you
helped
me
then
also
about
eight
years
ago
my
wife
had
two
months
treatment
from
you
which
helped
her
of
the
troubles
from
which
she
was
suffering
at
that
time
all
the
reasons
that
i
can
give
is
that
owing
to
financial
troubles
and
having
to
pay
out
so
much
for
sickness
i
could
not
seem
to
get
the
money
that
i
could
spare
to
pay
for
the
treatment
gentlemen
i
wish
i
could
express
my
thanks
to
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
but
i
can
not
do
it
i
am
a
poor
hand
to
express
myself
but
i
consider
my
restoration
to
health
almost
a
miracle
and
i
firmly
believe
that
i
owe
my
life
to
you
for
i
do
not
believe
that
i
should
have
lived
till
the
present
time
had
it
not
been
for
your
special
treatment
now
if
there
is
any
part
of
this
letter
that
you
would
wish
to
publish
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
so
and
if
it
would
be
the
means
of
directing
any

pronounced
an

lingered
on

had
a
dreadful
cough
i
was
so
weak

could
not

fifty

had
taken
every

that
was
recommended
for
similar
maladies
such
as
cod

sarsaparillas

without
any

i
was
about
discouraged
when
i
commenced
taking

i
took
six
bottles
and
it
completely
restored
me
to
health
the
discharge
stopped
from

has
ceased

extended

organic

of
the

by
organic
disease
we
mean
disease
pertaining
to
the
structure
of
the
heart
itself
in
contradistinction
to
disease
which
has
reference
merely
to
the
of
the
heart
the
heart
is
subject
to
various
organic
diseases
but
we
have
only
space
to
consider
in
the
briefest
manner
those
which
are
the
most
common
it
is
essential
that
the
reader
should
have
some
knowledge
of
the
anatomy
and
functions
of
the
various
parts
of
the
heart
in
order
that
its
diseases
and
their
effects
may
be
comprehended
therefore
the
anatomy
and
physiology
of
this
organ
given
in
part
i
chapter
vii
of
this
work
should
be
carefully
studied
it
is
very
evident
that
any
disease
which
affects
the
structure
and
function
of
any
part
of
the
heart
must
necessarily
give
rise
to
certain
modifications
of
the
pulse
sounds
etc
it
is
through
the
observation
and
study
of
these
modifications
and
changes
that
we
arrive
at
a
correct
diagnosis
as
to
the
precise
location
and
character
of

until
within
comparatively
recent
years
physicians
were
very
much
in
the
dark
regarding
diseases
of
the
heart
now
however
with
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
anatomy
physiology
and
pathology
of
the
heart
and
the
parts
surrounding
it
and
with
the
aid
of
instruments
which
modern
ingenuity
has
given
us
we
are
able
to
diagnosticate
with
precision
the
slightest
lesions
of
any
part
of
this
important
organ
and
knowing
their
nature
to
map
out
an
appropriate
course
of
treatment
with
the
aid
of
the
stethoscope
invented
by
laennec
and
improved
upon
by
camman
we
are
able
to
distinguish
the
slightest
deviation
from
the
normal
sounds
and
by
noting
the
character
of
the
sound
the
time
when
it
occurs
the
area
over
which
it
is
heard
most
distinctly
and
the
direction
in
which
it
is
transmitted
to
locate
the
lesion
which
produces
it
by
the
aid
of
the
sphygmograph
first
invented
by
herrisson
and
afterward
improved
upon
by
ludwig
vierordt
marey
and
lastly
by
pond
of
our
own
country
the
pulsations
at
the
wrist
are
registered
and
thus
made
perceptible
to
the
eye
we
herewith
give
a
cut
fig
of
pond
instrument
and
two
tracings
made
by
it
the
first
is
a
healthy
tracing
and
the
second
indicates
enlargement
technically
called
hypertrophy
of
the
heart
pericarditis
or
inflammation
of
the
membranous
sac
which
surrounds
the
heart
may
be
either
acute
or
chronic
the
symptoms
in
acute
pericarditis
are
made
up
from
affections
and
are
frequently
associated
with
articular
rheumatism
bright
disease
of
the
kidneys
or
pleuritis
the
intensity
of
the
pain
varies
in
different
individuals
the
action
of
the
heart
is
increased
the
pulse
is
quick
and
vomiting
sometimes
takes
place
when
this
disease
is
developed
in
the
course
of
rheumatism
it
is
known
as
rheumatic
pericarditis
and
is
almost
always
associated
with
endocarditis
in
some
cases
acute
pericarditis
is
very
distressing
in
others
it
is
mild
the
fatality
is
not
due
so
much
to
the
disease
itself
as
to
affections
when
it
does
not
prove
fatal
it
sometimes
becomes
chronic
in
chronic
pericarditis
pain
is
seldom
present
the
heart
is
generally
more
or
less
enlarged
its
sounds
are
feeble
the
first
being
weaker
than
the
second
endocarditis
or
inflammation
of
the
membrane
lining
the
cavities
of
the
heart
is
one
of
the
most
frequent
forms
of
heart
disease
it
is
almost
invariably
associated
with
acute
rheumatism
or
some
of
the
eruptive
fevers
as
scarlet
fever
and
is
due
to
the
irritation
of
the
unhealthy
blood
passing
through
the
heart
the
disease
is
generally
attended
with
little
or
no
pain
and
consequently
if
the
attending
physician
be
not
on
the
alert
it
will
escape
his
observation
when
associated
with
acute
rheumatism
the
disease
is
only
in
rare
instances
directly
fatal
but
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
it
leaves
permanent
organic
changes
which
sooner
or
later
develop
into
valvular
affections
and
these
may
eventually
destroy
life
when
the
disease
occurs
however
as
the
result
of
pyæmia
produced
by
the
absorption
of
decomposing
pus
or
matter
or
of
diphtheria
or
when
it
is
associated
with
any
other
septic
conditions
it
constitutes
a
very
grave
element
collections
of
matter
formed
on
the
membrane
lining
the
heart
and
covering
its
valves
are
liable
to
be
detached
and
carried
by
the
circulation
to
the
brain
spleen
or
liver
where
they
plug
up
some
artery
and
thus
cause
death
of
the
parts
which
it
supplies
with
blood
chronic
endocarditis
generally
occurs
in
rheumatic
subjects
unassociated
with
any
acute
disease
it
may
exist
without
any
marked
symptoms
except
perhaps
a
sense
of
oppression
and
uneasiness
in
the
chest
with
palpitation
it
produces
a
thickening
and
hardening
of
the
membrane
lining
the
heart
and
generally
causes
a
retraction
adhesion
and
degeneration
of
some
of
the
valves
of
the
heart
thus
bringing
on
valvular
disease
valvular
lesions
are
as
we
have
seen
very
frequently
the
result
of
endocarditis
they
are
of
two
kinds
first
those
which
prevent
the
valves
from
flapping
back
close
to
the
walls
of
the
ventricles
or
arteries
thus
diminishing
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
the
size
of
the
valvular
orifices
and
offering
an
obstruction
to
the
free
flow
of
blood
through
them
and
which
consist
of
a
thickening
and
retraction
or
adhesion
of
the
valves
chalky
deposits
morbid
growths
etc
secondly
those
which
prevent
complete
closure
of
the
valves
and
thus
permit
a
return
of
the
blood
into
the
cavity
from
which
it
has
just
been
expelled
these
latter
consist
of
retractions
perforations
and
partial
detachments
of
the
valves
chalky
deposits
around
the
base
of
the
valves
and
in
them
and
rupture
of
the
chordæ
tendineæ
these
two
forms
of
lesions
are
usually
one
generally
being
more
extensive
than
the
other
thus
the
regurgitation
may
be
slight
and
the
obstruction
great
or
the
symptoms
and
disturbance
of
the
circulation
are
altogether
dependent
upon
the
location
and
form
of
the
lesion
or
lesions
each
valvular
lesion
has
its
characteristic
sound
or
murmur
which
is
heard
at
a
particular
period
in
the
cycle
of
the
heart
action
and
it
is
as
before
stated
from
these
sounds
from
tracings
of
the
pulse
and
from
the
many
other
indications
that
we
arrive
at
a
diagnosis
thus
in
obstruction
of
the
orifice
at
the
junction
of
the
aorta
with
the
left
ventricle
one
of
the
most
frequent
of
valvular
lesions
a
murmur
generally
harsh
in
character
is
heard
with
the
first
sound
of
the
heart
with
greatest
intensity
directly
over
the
normal
position
or
the
aortic
semilunar
valves
this
is
conveyed
along
the
large
arteries
and
may
be
heard
less
distinctly
over
the
carotids
in
the
sphygmographic
tracing
the
line
of
ascent
is
less
abrupt
than
in
the
normal
tracing
fig
and
not
nearly
so
high
and
it
is
rounded
at
the
top
in
aortic
regurgitation
the
line
of
ascent
is
similar
to
that
of
the
healthy
tracing
but
the
line
of
descent
is
very
sudden
the
left
side
of
the
heart
is
almost
invariably
the
primary
seat
of
these
affections
but
in
the
latter
stages
of
their
course
the
right
side
also
is
liable
to
become
involved
and
as
a
consequence
there
then
exists
great
disturbance
of
the
venous
circulation
with
a
damming
back
of
the
blood
in
the
veins
and
passive
congestion
of
the
liver
kidneys
and
brain
followed
by
dropsy
albumen
in
the
urine
etc

hypertrophy
of
the

consists
of
a
thickening
of
the
muscular
walls
of
this
organ
it
may
be
confined
to
one
portion
of
the
heart
or
it
may
affect
the
entire
organ
the
affection
has
been
divided
into
the
following
three
forms
in
which
there
is
an
increase
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
of
the
heart
without
any
augmentation
in
the
capacity
of
the
cavities
and
which
is
usually
the
result
of
chronic
bright
disease
or
great
intemperance
in
which
there
is
an
increase
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
of
the
heart
together
with
increase
in
the
capacity
of
the
cavities
and
which
is
generally
the
result
of
some
valvular
lesion
and
in
which
there
is
an
increase
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
of
the
heart
with
a
decrease
in
the
capacity
of
the
cavities
valvular
lesions
obstructions
in
the
large
arteries
or
in
fact
any
thing
which
calls
upon
the
heart
to
constantly
perform
an
undue
amount
of
labor
must
necessarily
produce
hypertrophy
of
its
muscular
walls
just
as
the
undue
amount
of
labor
which
the
arm
is
called
upon
to
perform
produces
hypertrophy
of
its
muscles
with
this
condition
the

dilatation
of
the
heart
is
a
condition
which
is
closely
allied
to
hypertrophy
of
the
heart
and
which
consists
of
an
increase
in
the
capacity
of
the
cavities
of
the
heart
with
diminished
contractile
power
in
simple
dilatation
there
is
an
increase
in
the
capacities
of
the
cavities
without
any
marked
change
in
the
walls
of
the
organ
it
is
usually
the
result
of
some
disease
which
has
produced
great
muscular
prostration
and
which
has
interfered
materially
with
nutrition
more
frequently
however
dilatation
is
the
result
of
valvular
lesions
and
is
associated
with
hypertrophy
there
being
an
increase
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
with
a
diminution
of
the
contractile
power
the
hypertrophy
from
valvular
lesions
goes
on
increasing
until
it
reaches
a
certain
stage
when
dilatation
commences
the
two
conditions
then
being
associated
atrophy
of
the
heart
is
the
opposite
to
hypertrophy
and
signifies
a
wasting
away
of
the
muscular
substance
and
a
diminution
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
of
the
heart
its
power
is
diminished
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
atrophy
fatty
degeneration
of
the
heart
consists
in
the
deposition
of
particles
of
fat
within
the
the
sheath
which
invests
the
fibrils
which
are
substituted
for
the
proper
muscular
tissue
if
the
fatty
degeneration
exists
to
any
extent
the
muscular
walls
present
a
yellowish
color
and
the
heart
is
soft

flabby
this
may
be
confined
to
one
ventricle
or
it
may
affect
the
inner
layer
of

the
outer

remaining
unchanged
degeneration
of
the

occasions
feebleness
of

is
one
symptom
of
this
disease
especially
when
the
right
ventricle
is
affected
there
is
pallor
feeble
circulation
cold

and
frequently

years
angina
pectoris
also
termed
of
the
might
be
included
among
the
diseases
of
the
nervous
system
but
as
it
is
usually
associated
with
a
derangement
in
the
action
of
the
heart
it
may
be
properly
considered
in
this
connection
the
pain
varies
in
intensity
sometimes
being
very
acute
at
others
assuming
a
milder
form
the
action
of
the
heart
is
more
or
less
disturbed
the
beats
are
irregular
at
times
being
strong
while
again
they
are
feeble
a
feeling
of
numbness
is
experienced
in
those
parts
to
which
the
pain
penetrates
these
paroxysms
continue
but
a
few
minutes
although
they
sometimes
last
several
hours
persons
suffering
from
angina
pectoris
are
liable
to
sudden
death
it
is
connected
with
ossification
or
other
organic
changes
of
the
heart
usually
these
paroxysms
if
the
life
of
the
patient
continues
become
more
and
more
frequent
the
danger
is
not
to
be
measured
by
the
intensity
of
the
pain
but
by
the
organic
disease
although
it
is
not
absolutely
certain
that
organic
disease
is
present
in
all
cases
of
angina
pectoris
yet
the
exceptions
are
so
rare
that
when
the
signs
of
organic
disease
can
not
be
detected
it
may
be
inferred
that
angina
is
not
the
real
affection
or
that
the
existing
lesions
escape
observation
those
who
suffer
from
this
disease
are
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
of
the
male
sex
and
rarely
under
the
age
of
forty
treatment
in
the
foregoing
consideration
of
organic
diseases
of
the
heart
we
have
omitted
to
speak
of
their
remedial
management
for
the
obvious
reason
that
unprofessional
readers
are
unable
to
correctly
distinguish
between
the
various
diseases
of
this
vital
organ
and
it
would
therefore
be
useless
for
us
to
attempt
to
instruct
them
as
to
the
medicinal
treatment
of
the
different
cardiac
affections
in
the
vast
majority
of
instances
diseases
of
the
heart
are
not
necessarily
speedily
fatal
persons
have
been
known
to
live
twenty
years
or
more
with
very
extensive
organic
disease
of
this
organ
it
is
however
that
a
correct
diagnosis
be
made
in
the
early
stages
of
these
diseases
in
order
that
an
appropriate
course
of
hygiene
and
treatment
may
be
adopted
which
will
check
their
progress
while
we
can
not
cure
extensive
organic
diseases
of
the
heart
we
check
their
progress
and
prolong
life
and
render
the
condition
of
the
subject
comparatively
comfortable
since
we
are
able
to
diagnosticate
with
the
utmost
precision
the
various
affections
of
the
heart
and
since
the
discovery
of
certain
specific
medicines
which
exert
most
beneficial
effects
we
are
enabled
to
treat
this
class
of
maladies
with
the
most
gratifying
results
thus
we
have
seen
a
case
in
a
very
advanced
stage
of
the

with
the
breathing
so
difficult
that
the
subject
had
been
compelled
to
remain
almost
constantly

sitting
posture
in
the
greatest
agony
for
so
long
a
time
that
immense

sores
had
formed
on
the
seat
in
which
the
dropsy
had
become
so
extensive
that
the
skin
of
the
legs
had
burst
open
and
yet
this
patient
through
the
influence
of
a
specific
course
of
treatment
was
speedily
relieved
and
enabled
to
live
in
a
comparatively
comfortable

many
months

materna
during

period
of
nursing
and
sometimes
in
the
latter
months
of

women
are
liable
to
a
peculiar
variety
of
sore
mouth
the
soreness
is
sometimes
so
great
that
although
the
appetite
may
be
ravenous
the
patient
can
not
eat
when
this
condition
extends
to
the
stomach
and
bowels
symptoms
of
a
very
grave
character
appear
and
the
disease
by
interfering
with
the
process
of
nutrition
causes
emaciation
and
debility
and
in
extreme
cases
death
it
is
a
strange
affection
nearly
always
disappearing
upon
weaning
the
child
though
this
course
is
not
absolutely
necessary
it
appears
to
depend
upon
a
hepatic
or
gastric
derangement
in
connection
with
a
vitiated
condition
of
the
blood
but
how
this
is
brought
about
is
unknown
symptoms
the
disease
sometimes
comes
on
suddenly
at
others
more
slowly
the
fact
that
the
woman
is
either
pregnant
or
nursing
is
of
importance
in
forming
a
diagnosis
at
first
there
is
a
severe
scalding
sensation
of
the
tongue
mouth
and
fauces
with
pain
which
is
sometimes
intense
the
color
of
the
tongue
is
often
pink
or
a
light
red
while
the
mouth
is
generally
of
a
deeper
hue
this
stinging
biting
sensation
is
accompanied
by
a
profuse
watery
discharge
from
the
mouth
which
seems
extremely
hot
and
acrid
causing
excoriation
whenever
it
comes
in
contract
with
the
face
or
chin
the
appetite
is
good
sometimes
ravenous
but
food
or
drinks
except
of
the
blandest
character
occasion
such
intense
pain
that
the
patient
avoids
their
use
ulceration
occurs
after
a
little
time
the
bowels
are
generally
constipated
but
when
the
disease
extends
to
the
stomach
or
intestines
diarrhea
occurs
there
is
generally
anæmia
debility
and
impairment
of
the
vital
powers
treatment
the
indications
for
treatment
in
this
affection
are
to
overcome
the
vitiated
condition
of
the
blood
and
to
sustain
the
vital
powers
the
remedies
for
this
purpose
are
alteratives
antiseptics
and
tonics
give
the
golden
medical
discovery
the
value
of
which
may
be
greatly
enhanced
by
adding
ounce
of
the
fluid
extract
of
baptisia
to
each
bottle
in
doses
of
a
teaspoonful
four
times
a
day
chlorate
of
potash
half
an
ounce
in
a
pint
of
water
used
as
a
wash
and
gargle
is
of
great
value
a
teaspoonful
of
the
same
may
be
swallowed
several
times
a
day
this
will
not
interfere
with
other
medicines
as
a
tonic
the
tincture
of
the
muriate
of
iron
in
five
to
doses
diluted
with
water
may
be
taken
three
or
four
times
daily
quinine
in
one
or
doses
should
be
given
with
the
iron
if
the
debility
be
extreme
when
there
is
great
acidity
of
the
stomach
which
may
be
known
by
heart
burn
saleratus
may
be
taken
in
water
to
neutralize
it
but
should
not
be
drunk
within
an
hour
of
the
time
for
taking
other
medicines
if
constipation
exists
use
the
pleasant
pellets
this
course
of
treatment
thoroughly
carried
out
will
seldom
fail
to
effect
a
perfect
cure
without
weaning
the
child
yet
this
latter
course
may
sometimes
become
advisable
to
promote
the
recovery
of
the
patient
should
the
treatment
advised
not
produce
the
desired
result
a
skillful
physician
services
should
be
secured
as
he
may
in
individual
cases
distinguish
other
important
indications
which
may
enable
him
to
modify
the
treatment
to
advantage
diarrhea
cholera
infantum
or
summer
complaint
and
dysentery
these
diseases
are
usually
considered
separately
by
medical
writers
but
as
they
are
closely
related
a
simple
diarrhea
not
unfrequently
running
into
a
or
a
dysentery
we
shall
consider
them
together
diarrhea
is
an
affection
characterized
by
unnaturally
frequent
evacuations
from
the
bowels
of
a
liquid
of
morbidly
soft
consistency
it
may
be
simple
or
inflammatory
and
acute
or
chronic
a
diarrhea
is
said
to
be
bilious
when
the
discharges
are
composed
principally
of
serum
highly
colored
with
yellow
or
green
bile
catarrhal
when
they
are
of
a
mucous
character
serous
when
the
dejections
are
thin
and
watery
sometimes
mixed
with
blood
bile
or
ingesta
the
symptoms
of
the
affection
are
usually
at
first
those
of
indigestion
a
fullness
of
the
stomach
flatulency
and
colicky
pains
the
pains
which
precede
each
evacuation
are
intermittent
in
character
there
may
be
an
unpleasant
sinking
sensation
in
the
abdomen
and
with
the
discharge
exhaustion
a
feeble
pulse
and
a
cool
skin
in
the
inflammatory
variety
there
is
more
or
less
fever
cholera
infantum
or
summer
complaint
is
a
disease
peculiar
to
the
warm
season
and
more
prevalent
in
cities
and
among
those
children
who
do
not
nurse
at
the
breast
it
is
characterized
by
great
irritability
of
the
stomach
and
persistent
vomiting
and
purging
the
discharges
from
the
bowels
being
copious
and
watery
and
sometimes
containing
specks
of
curd
matter
and
mucus
the
limbs
of
the
little
sufferer
are
usually
drawn
up
indicating
pain
in
the
bowels
and
there
is
great
prostration
with
cold
extremities
the
invasion
may
be
so
sudden
and
the
disease
so
violent
as
to
destroy
life
in
a
few
hours
dysentery
also
known
as
consists
of
an
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
large
intestine
with
ulceration
of
the
affected
surfaces
the
disease
is
accompanied
with
much
nervous
prostration
and
is
distinguished
by
severe
pains
in
the
abdomen
of
a
griping
nature
followed
by
frequent
scanty
and
bloody
stools
and
much
straining
occasionally
the
attack
is
ushered
in
with
a
chill
and
aching
pains
in
various
parts
of
the
body
with
copious
fecal
dejections
in
other
cases
the
attack
is
preceded
by
loss
of
appetite
a
sense
of
uneasiness
with
dull
pains
in
the
abdomen
and
weariness
the
disease
like
diarrhea
may
be
either
acute
or
chronic
the
causes
of
these
affections
of
the
bowels
are
many
and
varied
they
may
be
brought
on
by
exposure
to
cold
and
wet
or
by
improper
and
indigestible
articles
of
food
such
as
unripe
fruits
salads
pastries
and
in
fact
anything
which
interferes
with
the
normal
operations
of
the
digestive
apparatus
one
of
the
most
fertile
sources
of
diarrhea
in
infants
and
of
is
the
administration
of
unsuitable
food
the
ill
effects
of
which
are
greatly
increased
by
exposure
to
heat
or
cold
uncleanliness
and
the
inhalation
of
impure
air
are
prolific
causes
of
these
diseases
epidemics
have
been
supposed
to
be
due
to
some
peculiarity
in
the
condition
of
the
atmosphere
or
to
some
impalpable
germ
of
a
vegetable
or
animal
nature
treatment
in
the
treatment
of
these
diseases
one
should
first
endeavor
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
trouble
and
then
if
possible
effect
its
removal
attention
should
be
given
to
the
hygienic
surroundings
of
the
individual
afflicted
if
he
reside
in
a
miasmatic
district
or
in
a
location
in
which
the
atmosphere
is
contaminated
by
the
decomposition
of
animal
or
vegetable
matter
or
filled
with
noxious
gases
his
abode
should
be
changed
a
pure
dry
air
is
most
beneficial
in
these
cases
only
the
least
irritating
and
most
easily
digestible
articles
of
food
should
be
taken
healthy
cow
milk
is
slightly
alkaline
but
that
of
cows
fed
on
slops
is
usually
acid
and
unfit
for
infants
it
is
therefore
well
to
test
all
milk
with
blue
litmus
paper
before
feeding
it
to
young
children
if
found
to
be
strongly
acid
that
is
if
it
turns
the
paper
red
it
should
be
rejected
but
if
only
slightly
so
sufficient
lime
water
may
be
added
to
render
it
slightly
alkaline
for
adults
and
older
children
the
diet
should
consist
of
such
starchy
foods
as
sago
corn
starch
and
rice
and
of
ripe
grapes
freed
from
the
skins
and
seeds
peaches
and
boiled
milk
or
milk
and
lime
water
in
some
cases
the
animal
broths
are
beneficial
especially
mutton
broth
to
quench
the
thirst
crust
coffee
rice
coffee
and
lemonade
in
small
quantities
may
be
taken
rest
is
important
in
these
diseases
in
severe
cases
the
patient
should
be
kept
in
bed
at
the
onset
of
an
attack
of
diarrhea
or
dysentery
if
there
be
reason
to
believe
that
the
intestinal
tract
contains
irritating
matter
a
dose
of
castor
oil
with
a
few
drops
of
anise
oil
added
to
render
it
palatable
should
be
administered
after
all
irritating
ingesta
have
been
removed
pierce
compound
extract
of
should
be
given
in
doses
proportionate
to
the
age

severity
of
the
case
being
composed
of
the
extract
of
or
water
pepper
jamaica
ginger
camphor
and
genuine
french
grape
brandy
it
exerts
a
most
wonderful
effect
not
only
in
those
diseases
but
in
cholera
morbus
and
intestinal
colic
it
allays
the
irritation
and
inflammation
of
the
affected
mucous
surfaces
and
soothes
the
nervous
system
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
the
above
course
of
treatment
will
be
found
sufficient
but
in
the
more
severe
forms
of
these
diseases
additional
remedies
may
be
required
in
dysentery
accompanied
with
severe
pain
and
straining
injections
of
starch
water
and
laudanum
from
two
to
four
ounces
of
the
former
to
from
twenty
to
fifty
drops
of
the
latter
should
be
used
hot
fomentations
applied
to
the
abdomen
are
beneficial
if
the
discharges
contain
much
blood
a
flannel
cloth
moistened
with
the
spirits
of
turpentine
should
be
laid
over
the
lower
part
of
the
abdomen
and
kept
there
until
slight
irritation
is
produced
lime
water
bicarbonate
of
soda
bicarbonate
of
potash
saleratus
chalk
and
the
subnitrate
of
bismuth
are
valuable
agents
to
correct
the
secretions
and
allay
irritation
of
the
diseased
mucous
surface
the
preparations
of
soda
potash
and
bismuth
may
be
taken
in
doses
of
from
five
to
twenty
grains
every
few
hours
blackberry
root
and
cranesbill
in
the
form
of
fluid
extract
or
infusion
are
beneficial
in
acute
cases
in
which
the
discharges
are
profuse
and
watery
and
in
the
chronic
forms
of
these
affections
in
subnitrate
of
bismuth
should
be
given
in
doses
of
from
five
to
ten
grains
at
intervals
of
from
two
to
four
hours
if
the
discharges
are
very
profuse
the
fluid

of
cranesbill
may
be
administered
in
from
two
to
doses
alternately
with
the
bismuth
the
camphorated
tincture
of
opium
paregoric
is
required
in
doses
of
from
two
to
twenty
drops
depending
upon
the
age
of
the

and
the
severity
of
the
case

great
caution
should
be
exercised
in

death
in
more
than
one
instance
to
check

may
be
laid
over

for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
if
the

is
old
enough
to
suck
pellets
of

treatment
the
indication
to
be
fulfilled
in

this
may
be
done
by
drinking

is
effectual
if
simple
means
do
not
promptly
arrest
the
attack
no
time
should
be
lost
in
summoning
the
family
physician
in
colic
the
treatment
should
depend
upon
the
cause

a
teaspoonful
or
two
of
the
extract
of

will
answer
the
purpose
if
the

jaundice
icterus
this
affection
is
generally
regarded
as
a
symptom
of
disordered
liver
since
it
frequently
occurs
during
the
progress
of
diseases
of
that
organ
when
the
disease
imparts
a
greenish
tinge
to
the
skin
it
is
termed
jaundice
and
when
it
imparts
a
blackish
color
it
is
known
as
jaundice
is
undoubtedly
due
to
the
presence
of
biliary
elements
in
the
blood
causes
in
consequence
of
the
varied
conditions
from
which
it
arises
professor
da
costa
has
aptly
remarked
with
the
of
jaundice
the
difficulty
in
diagnosis
may
be
said
to
begin
he
considers
the
causes
of
jaundice
to
be
diseases
of
the
liver
disease
or
the
bile
ducts
diseases
remote
from
the
liver
or
general
disease
leading
to
a
disorder
of
that
viscus
certain
causes
acting
upon
the
blood
symptoms
it
is
characterized
by
a
yellowish
color
of
the
skin
and
of
the
white
of
the
eyes
the
skin
is
usually
dry
and
harsh
if
it
be
moist
the
linen
will
be
tinged
yellow
from
the
perspiration
the
tongue
is
coated
yellow
the
mouth
is
dry
and
the
appetite
impaired
there
is
headache
nausea
and
sometimes
vomiting
there
is
pain
in
the
abdomen
after
eating
and
in
the
region
of
the
liver
and
it
is
also
felt
in
the
right
shoulder
and
between
the
in
severe
cases
there
is
fever
accompanied
with
chills
despondency
and
loss
of
flesh
the
stools
are
generally
of
a
light
clay
color
and
very
offensive
the
urine
is
thick
and
yellow
when
the
disease
terminates
fatally
there
is
delirium
followed
by
stupor
treatment
the
first
step
should
be
to
eliminate
from
the
system
as
speedily
as
possible
all
noxious
materials
for
this
purpose
the
bath
should
be
used
if
the
urine
is
scanty
or
voided
with
difficulty
take
acetate
of
potash
or
queen
of
the
meadow
these
may
be
taken
in
connection
with
the
golden
medical
discovery
and
purgative
pellets
the
efficacy
of
which
has
already
been
described
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
inflammation
of
the
liver
they
are
indeed
valuable
agents
in
this
disease
since
they
increase
the
action
of
all
the
excretory
glands
and
rapidly
remove
those
matters
which
if
retained
would
poison
the
system
in
some
cases
acids
are
of
great
value
good
hard
cider
or
hydrochloric
acid
and
the
acid
bath
are
frequently
valuable
agents
in
other
cases
the
employment
both
internally
and
externally
of
alkalies
in
addition
to
the
golden
medical
discovery
answers
the
purpose
much
better
again
there
are
persons
who
in
addition
to
alteratives
and
baths
require
tonics
in
the
treatment
or
this
affection
whatever
may
be
the
nature
of
the
case
the
use
of
must
not
be
forgotten
for
them
the
auxiliary
treatment
with
acids
alkalies
and
tonics
will
not
produce
the
desired
effect
the
employment
of
drastic
remedies
is
sometimes
resorted
to
but
although
they
may
give
temporary
relief
the
patient
soon
relapses
into
his
former
condition
while
if
the
treatment
above
given
be
adopted
the
recovery
will
be
permanent
biliary
calculi
these
are
concretions
found
in
the
or
bile
duct
and
vary
from
the
size
of
a
pea
to
that
of
a
hen

may
be
no
indication
of
their
existence
in

they
begin
to

the
formation
of

undoubtedly
due
to
an
unhealthy
condition
of
the

corpulent

and
those
indulging
in
diet
or
in
the
habitual
use
of
fermented
drinks
are
most
liable
to
be
troubled
by
them
symptoms
the
patient
is
suddenly
seized
with
excruciating
pain
in
the
right
side
after
a
time
it
subsides
but
is
again
renewed
with
as
great
severity
as
before
there
is
nausea
with
vomiting
which
is
often
excessive
and
severe
the
pulse
is
sometimes
slower
than
is
natural
the
extremities
are
cold
there
is
great
exhaustion
together
with
perspiration
and
spasmodic
contraction
of
the
abdominal
muscles
as
soon
as
one
stone
has
passed
through
the

into

immediate
relief
is
experienced
until
another
commences
to

the
larger

the
pain

the

be
washed

chiefly
in
relieving
the
patient
of

the
passage
of
the
hot
fomentations
made
with
stramonium
leaves
and
lobelia

beneficial
small
doses
of
lobelia
may
be
taken

not
in
sufficient
quantities

of

this
anodyne

however
be
used
with
care
gelseminum

carbonate

distressing
symptoms
are
apt
to
recur

is
effected

be
insured
and
the
subsequent
formation
of
prevented
intestinal
worms
we
have
not
the
space
to
discuss
the
numerous
theories
which
have
been
offered
to
account
for
the
presence
of
these
parasites
in
the
human
body
we
shall
enumerate
the
principal
species
describe
the
symptoms
indicating
their
presence
and
indicate
the
proper
remedies
there
are
five
species
of
intestinal
worms
sufficiently
common
to
merit
a
description
the
round
worm
termed
by
naturalists
varies
from
six
inches
to
a
foot
in
length
and
resembles
the
common
it
infests
the
small
intestines
and
seldom
migrates
into
the
stomach
or
large
bowel
instances
are
recorded
however
in
which
it
has
crept
upward
in
the
esophagus
larynx
nostrils
and
eustachian
tube
but
their
presence
in
these
parts
is
of
comparatively
rare
occurrence
and
is
generally
caused
by
some
local
irritation
which
compels
their
migration
the
fact
that
they
have
been
found
in
the
peritoneal
sac
gave
rise
to
the
opinion
that
they
perforate
the
intestine
but
careful
observations
have
proved
that
they
can
only
escape
through
openings
made
by
ulcers
this
species
has
been
found
in
adults
but
is
more
common
in
children
from
three
to
twelve
years
of
age
the
number
of
this
species
existing
in
a
human
body
is
variable
sometimes
only
two
or
three
are
found
at
other
times
a
hundred
and
even
twice
that
number
are
voided
in
a
few
days
the
thread
pin
or
is
round
very
slender
and
about
half
an
inch
in
length
the
habitation
of
this
species
is
the
rectum
and
they
are
often
found
matted
together
in
the
excrement
they
are
very
active
even
after
ejection
and
have
been
known
to
cause
great
local
irritation
by
entering
the
vagina
and
urethra
their
presence
is
an
occasional
cause
of
masturbation
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
the
number
of
these
parasites
that
may
exist
in
the
human
rectum
great
numbers
sometimes
are
voided
at
a
single
evacuation
the
is
a
third
variety
of
the
round
worm
and
is
said
to
infest
the
bodies
of
almost
every
species
of
mammalia
as
its
name
indicates
the
upper
portion
of
its
body
is
slender
and
terminates
at
the
lower
extremity
in
a
thick
spiral
portion
it
is
from
one
to
two
inches
in
length
and
is
found
attached
by
its
head
to
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
cæcum
and
in
rare
instances
in
the
colon
and
small
intestine
they
are
rarely
numerous
or
are
hermaphrodites
of
a
flat
form
and
are
composed
of
numerous
segments
each
of
which
is
provided
with
a
complete
set
of
generative
organs
and
contains
ova
for
the
production
of
thousands
of
individuals
some
authors
have
supposed
that
each
segment
or
joint
is
a
distinct
individual
but
the
existence
of
one
head
for
the
whole
precludes
this
theory
there
are
two
species
of
developed
in
the
human
intestine
the
and
the
the
is
the
species
commonly
found
in
america
and
all
the
countries
of
europe
except
france
russia
and
switzerland
in
france
both
species
are
found
but
the
tænia
lata
seems
to
be
indigenous
to
russia
and
switzerland
the
varies
in
length
from
four
or
five
to
thirty
or
even
forty
feet
the
head
is
hemispherical
and
armed
with
a
double
row
of
twenty
or
thirty
hooklets
the
genital
organs
are
alternate
and
placed
upon
the
outer
edges
of
each
segment
it
inhabits
the
small
intestine
and
is
usually
solitary
the
or
broad
is
distinguished
by
the
greater
breadth
of
its
segments
and
the
location
of
the
genital
organs
which
are
found
in
the
centre
of
each
segment
its
small
elongated
head
is
unarmed
and
has
a
longitudinal
fissure
on
each
side
it
usually
attains
a
greater
length
than
the
symptoms
the
symptoms
which
the
long
worms
occasion
are
frequently
somewhat
obscure
thirst
irregular
appetite
colicky
pains
excessive
flow
of
saliva
enlargement
of
the
abdomen
itching
of
the
nose
pallor
of
the
face
offensive
breath
disturbed
sleep
and
grinding
of
the
teeth
all
are
common
symptoms
occasionally
convulsions
and
other
nervous
affections
are
produced
by
the
presence
of
the
lumbricoides
but
generally
they
produce
less
constitutional
disturbance
than
the
other
varieties
the
passage
of
this
species
of
worms
from
the
bowels
or
their
ejection
from
the
stomach
is
the
only
positive
evidence
of
their
presence
the
thread
pin
or
gives
rise
to
most
of
the
symptoms
produced
by
the
long
worms
but
in
addition
produces
intense
itching
at
the
anus
and
not
unfrequently
an
eruption
upon
that
part
the
itching
is
particularly
distressing
at
night
when
the
little
sufferer
is
well
covered
the
warmth
occasioned
by
the
causes
these
little
parasites
to
crawl
out
upon
the
anus
and
produces
such
paroxysms
of
itching
and
pain
as
to
cause
the
child
to
kick
the
covering
oft
and
lie
naked
the
persistent
manifestations
of
a
disposition
to
lie
naked
should
excite
the
parents
suspicions
of
and
lead
them
to
investigate
all
the
symptoms
by
examining
the
child
stools
the
worms
may
he
found
adhering
to
the
feces
and
they
may
also
be
seen
on
the
anus
thousands
of
children
suffer
untold
agony
from
these
little
which
are
left
unmolested
to
torment
them
because
the
parents
are
unfamiliar
with
the
meaning
of
the
symptoms
manifested
and
therefore
pay
no
heed
to
them
we
have
been
thus
particular
in
describing
the
symptoms
indicating
the
presence
of
these
pestiferous
parasites
in
order
that
they
may
be
readily
detected

by
the

dizziness
ringing
in
the
ears
increased
secretion
of
saliva
indigestion
ravenous
appetite
sharp
abdominal
pains
and
emaciation
the
only
positive
sign
of
the
presence
of
these
parasites
is
the
passage
of
pieces
of
them
in
the
feces
the
nervous
and
other
symptoms
produced
by
the
ordinary
long
worms
are
also
caused
by
the
causes
careful
observations
have
proved
that
there
are
certain
causes
which
favor
the
generation
or
development
of
intestinal
worms
among
others
we
may
mention
fatty
or
farinaceous
articles
of
food
gormandizing
constant
exposure
to
a
moist
atmosphere
and
sedentary
habits
it
is
now
generally
conceded
that
the
development
of
is
due
to
the
swallowing
of
an
egg
or
which
is
contained
in
many
kinds
of
animal
food

the
process
of

an

a
very
efficient
remedy
a

strong

with
vaseline
lard
oil
or
fresh
butter
after

whatever

remedy
is
used
it
should
be
followed
by
the

otherwise
they
will
continue
to
deposit
their
eggs
about
that
orifice

have
been
used
to

others
we
may
mention

the
most
serious

the
impossibility
of
removing
the
trichinæ
after
they
have

is
apparent
and
as
yet
no

has
been
recommended
to
remove
them

the
only
safety
lies
in
prevention
hence
raw

dyspepsia
it

generally
conceded
that
a

arise
from

in
its
various
forms
it
taxes
the
skill
of
the
physician
to
prescribe
the

it
is
undeniable
that
the
closest
intimacy
exists
between
happiness
and

a
healthy
digestion
aids
materially
in
making

johnson

the

to
the

of
the
most
important
of
these
remedial
agents
hitherto
almost
wholly
unknown
to
the
medical
profession
and
the
encouraging
results
attending
our
practice
have
amply
repaid
us
for
the
investigation
and
originality
in
our
treatment
of
this
affection
a
careful
chemical
and
microscopical
examination
of
the
urine
often
discloses
the
actual
morbid
conditions
which
perpetuate
this
functional
disease
chronic
diarrhea
on
account
of
the
frequency
and
importance
of
chronic
diarrhea
we
deem
it
worthy
of
special
consideration
it
is
frequently
the
sequel
of
the
acute
form
of
the
affection
the
urgent
and
severe
symptoms
of
acute
diarrhea
are
often
abated
but
the
disease
is
not
completely
cured
the
bowels
are
left
in
an
irritable
condition
perhaps
in
a
state
of
chronic
ulceration
which
perpetuates
morbid
discharges
the
most
noticeable
symptom
is
the
tendency
to
frequent
and
unhealthy
discharges
from
the
intestines
the
evacuated
matter
varies
much
in
appearance
and
character
in
different
cases
the
precise
location
of
the
morbid
conditions
which
give
rise
to
the
discharges
as
well
as
to
their
extent
modifies
the
color
consistency
and
ingredients
of
the
stools
most
frequently
they
are
dark
colored
and
of
very
offensive
odor
they
are
of
a
more
liquid
character
than
is
natural
except
when
as
is
sometimes
the
case
periods
of
constipation
alternate
with
periods
of
unnatural
looseness
tormina

usually
present

not
so
severe
as
in
the
acute

accompanies
it
the

the

and
the

the
affection
may
be
the
sequel
of
neglected
or
badly
treated
acute

arise
from
the
injudicious
use
of

such
as

the

scurvy
or
some
of
the
various
forms
of
scrofulous
disease
the
more
prominent
symptoms
are
so
apparent
and
so
characteristic
that
the
most
unskilled
may
be
able
to
decide
whether
the
patient
has
chronic
diarrhea
but
to
determine
in
what
portion
of
the
intestinal
canal
the
affection
is
chiefly
seated
to
decide
upon
the
extent
of
its
ravages
to
ascertain
what
peculiar
shade
or
type
the
affection
has
taken
on
to
investigate
its
complications
and
modifications
to
ferret
out
its
producing
or
aggravating
causes
and
above
all
to
nicely
and
skillfully
adjust
remedies
to
meet
the
depraved
conditions
is
by
no
means
an
easy
task
even
for
the
educated
and
experienced
physician
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
is
a
dangerous
malady
and
one
which
should
not
be
trifled
with
or
neglected
its
tendency
is
to
corrode
and
destroy
the
bowels
a
process
which
if
unchecked
must
sooner
or
latter
result
in
death
there
is
little
tendency
to
spontaneous
recovery
nor
is
a
removal
of
the
exciting
cause
often
followed

knowledge
of

influence
on

the
symptoms
may
differ
according
to
the
circumstances

not
unfrequently
the
complexion
becomes
pale

eye
headache
a
bitter
taste
in
the
mouth
tongue
coated
white
or
covered
with
a

at
others
it

the
urine
is

nor
are
any
two
cases
alike
in
every
respect
they
vary
according
to
the
organs
most
implicated

hepatic
derangement
thus
when
chronic
inflammation
of

may
have
palpitation
excessive

amounting
sometimes
to

ferments
and
gives
rise
to
eructations
and
various
other
manifestations
of

and
a
sensation
of
weight
in
the
back
while
the
urine
may
be
scanty
and
or
abundant
pale
and
limpid
frequently
charged
with
sedimentary
products
of
disease
and
voided
with
difficulty
if
the
be
implicated
in
this
chronic
affection
the
menstrual
function
may
be
deranged
and
result
in
an
excessive
or
a
deficient
monthly
flow
and
be
followed
by
profuse
leucorrhea
the
preceding
allusion
to
the
complications
of
chronic
inflammation
of
the
liver
shows
the
necessity
of
clearly
distinguishing
between
the
symptoms
of
this
disorder
and
those
reflected
by
the
organs
which
sympathetically
respond
to
discriminate
more
effectually
and
place
the
correctness
of
the
diagnosis
beyond
doubt
we
make
a
chemical
and
microscopical
examination
of
the
urine
and
thereby
detect
the
morbid
products
which
it
contains
and
direct
our
attention
to
the
diseased
organs
furnishing
them
these
examinations
together
with
a
complete
history
of
the
case
enable
us
to
make
a
correct
and
definite
diagnosis
of
the
disease
and
the
extent
to
which
it
has
affected
the
other
organs
before
entering
upon
the
consideration
of
treatment
let
us
briefly
enumerate
the
functions
of
the
liver
it
removes
matter
which
if
allowed
to
remain
in
the
blood
would
become
noxious
and
unfit
it
for
the
further
support
of
the
body
by
secreting
bile
it
furnishes
to
the
digestive
organs
a
fluid
which
assists
in
converting
the
food
into
chyle
stimulates
the
intestine
to
action
and
then
is
itself
transformed
and
absorbed
with
the
chylous
products
after
which
it
circulates
with
the
blood
and
assists
in
nutrition
until
becoming
injurious
and
pernicious
it
is
and
to
serve
again
as
described
for
its
growth
and
nourishment
the
liver
is
furnished
with
blood
by
the
hepatic
artery
but
for
the
purpose
of
secretion
and
depuration
it
is
abundantly
supplied
with
venous
blood
by
the
portal
system
which
is
made
up
of
veins
from
the
spleen
stomach
pancreas
and
intestines
this
impure
venous
blood
surcharged
with
biliary
elements
which
must
be
withdrawn
from
it
is
freely
poured
into
the
minute
network
of
this
glandular
organ
in
a
healthy
condition
of
the
liver
the
carbonaceous
elements
of
the
blood
are
converted
into
sugar
and
the
constituents
of
the
bile
are
liberated
by
the
liver
and
set
apart
for
further
duties
when
it
fails
to
eliminate
these
noxious
elements
from
the
blood
it
is
itself
thoroughly
vitiated
by
them
treatment
food
must
be
rich
in
carbon
in
order
that
it
may
build
up
the
tissues
and
keep
the
body
warm
but
carbonic
acid
the
result
of
the
combustion
must
be
removed
from
the
blood
or
death
will
ensue
so
bile
is
necessary
to
digestion
nutrition
and
life
yet
if
it
be
not
separated
from
the
blood
by
the
secreting
action
of
the
liver
it
will
as
surely
poison
the
system
and
destroy
life
as
carbonic
acid
although
the
constituents
of
the
bile
exist
in
the
blood
they
must
be
removed
in
order
that
the
blood
may
be
rendered
more
fit
to
support
the
body
while
the
secreted
bile
is
destined
to
assist
in
digestion
and
the
mysterious
process
of
nutrition
therefore
we
should
induce
a
secretion
of
bile
and
restore
the
normal
activity
of
the
liver
this
should
be
done
not
by
administering
stimulants
but
by
relieving
it
of
all
contingent
embarrassments
as
far
as
possible
would
any
one
think
of
giving
to
a
weak
debilitated
man
large
portions
of
brandy
to
enable
him
to
work
does
not
every
one
know
that
when
the
unnatural
stimulus
is
removed
he
fails
apply
this
principle
in
the
treatment
of
the
liver
when
harsh
unnatural
stimulants
and
medicines
are
administered
for
a
time
and
then
withheld
the
liver
relapses
into
a
more
torpid
and
debilitated
condition
than
before
treatment
was
begun
is
not
this
true
of
of
all
who
suffer
from
this
malady
and
have
recourse
to
this
class
of
remedies
then
how
can
we
remedially
fulfill
the
preceding
indications
we
answer
in
the
language
of
a
distinguished
author
and
standard
medical
writer
by
using
a
class
of
agents
which
should
never
be
overlooked
in
the
treatment
of
liver
diseases
chiefly
addressed
to
the
blood
and
denominated
and
are
required
not
only
in
diseases
of
the
liver
but
in
a
large
number
of
ailments
in
which
the
blood
becomes
charged
with
morbid
materials
the
active
remedial
properties
of
the
most
efficient
agents
of
the
above
classes
of
medicine
now
known
are
scientifically
combined
in
the
golden
medical
discovery
which
acts
upon
the
blood
and
hence
influences
the
system
generally
it
is
also
powerful
in
eliminating
those
morbid
humors
which
are
afterwards
subjected
to
excretion
through
various
organs
its
action
is
radically
different
from
most
medicines
employed
in
chronic
diseases
for
the
reason
that
what
is
usually
prescribed
is
something
corrosive
unless
the
disease
be
temporary
it
may
return
with
increased
violence
we
have
been
very
minute
in
the
description
of
the
remedial
properties
of
the
golden
medical
discovery
and
have
relied
upon
the
reason
and
intelligence
of
our
patrons
believing
that
they
can
in
a
degree
understand
why
we
deem
it
so
applicable
to
the
system
it
does
not
debilitate
the
liver
by
nor
irritate
the
stomach
and
bowels
by
disturbing
the
delicate
processes
of
digestion
neither
does
it
act
with
severity
upon
the
blood
but
it
operates
so
gently
insensibly
and
yet
with
so
much
certainty
that
it
excites
the
surprise
and
admiration
of
the
patient
from
the
careful
detail
of
its
various
properties
there
is
abundant
reason
for
its
favorable
action
upon
all
of
the
excretory
organs
which
in
the
removal
of
morbid
materials
from
the
system
if
however
the
bowels
are
unusually
sluggish
or
obstinately
constipated
it
is
advisable
in
conjunction
with
the
golden
medical
discovery
to
use
the
pleasant
pellets
which
are
also
powerfully
alterative
besides
being
mild
and
unirritating
in
their
operation
they
are
the
natural
assistants
of
the
discovery
working
harmoniously
together
they
should
be
taken
in
small
doses
and
their
use
perseveringly
followed
until
the
bowels
are
properly
regulated
by
the
use
of
the
discovery
alone
it
has
been
customary
to
resort
to
powerful
drastic
cathartics
followed
by
bitters
prepared
in
dilute
alcohol
the
habit
is
unscientific
for
it
is
well
known
that
alcohol
deranges
the
functions
of
the
digestive
organs
and
depraves
the
blood
besides
creating
a
morbid
appetite
it
has
been
repeatedly
demonstrated
that
the
use
of
such
bitters
has
led
to
a
life
of
drunkenness
with
all
the
woe
and
untold
misery
which
attend
it
medicines
to
be
strictly
remedial
should
exert
a
tonic
influence
upon
all
the
vital
processes
those
organs
which
are
contiguous
to
the
liver
or
connected
by
sympathy
with
it
should
be
assisted
in
the
performance
of
their
functions
persons
who
are
habitually
subject
to
bilious
attacks
are
pleased
to
find
that
the
use
of
the
discovery
and
pellets
furnishes
immunity
from
such
onsets
and
prevents
their
usual
recurrence
thus
these
remedies
are
as
well
as
what
we
have
thus
far
recommended
for
the
treatment
of
this
chronic
affection
is
within
the
reach
of
every
family
patients
laboring
under
this
disease
when
complicated
with
other
affections
require
special
consideration
and
treatment
and
all
such
are
counseled
to
employ
only
those
physicians
whose
experience
and
success
entitle
them
to
confidence
health
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
blessings
and
how
to
restore
it
when
lost
is
a
question
of
vital
importance
having
successfully
treated
thousands
of
invalids
who
have
suffered
from
this
chronic
affection
we
possess
abundant
evidence
of
the
curability
of
the
disease
but
we
have
only
space
to
publish
a
few
letters
from
persons
who
have
been
under
our
care
or
who
have
used
our
medicines
purchased
from
druggists
constipation
costiveness
health
depends
very
largely
upon
the
regularity
of
the
bowels
there
should
be
proper
alvine
evacuations
every
day
there
are
few
persons
who
have
not
suffered
at
some
period
of
their
lives
from
constipation
of
the
bowels
inattentive
to
the
calls
of
nature
or
a
neglect
to
regularly
attend
to
this
important
duty
sooner
or
later
produces
disastrous
results
furthermore
it
is
essential
to
the
comfort
of
every
individual
for
when
this
function
is
not
performed
there
is
derangement
of
the
mental
as
well
as
of
the
bodily
organs
constipation
or
as
it
is
sometimes
termed
is
a
functional
derangement
of
the
large
intestine
this
intestine
is
about
five
feet
in
length
and
consists
of
the
cæcum
colon
and
rectum
it
serves
as
a
temporary
reservoir
for
the
excrementitial
residue
of
alimentary
matter
and
for
the
effete
materials
excreted
by
the
glands
contained
in
its
mucous
coats
it
is
distinguished
as
the
intestine
because
of
its
great
size
habitual
constipation
produces
many
derangements
resulting
from
or
by
referring
to
figs
and
the
reader
may
observe
the
anatomical
relations
which
the
large
intestine
sustains
to
the
other
abdominal
organs
the
ascending
colon
arises
in
the
cæcum
fig
at
the
lower
part
of
the
abdomen
and
passes
over
the
kidney
on
the
right
side
where
it
begins
a
circuitous
route
around
the
abdominal
cavity
comes
in
contact
with
the
inferior
surface
of
the
liver
proceeds
behind
and
below
the
large
curvature
of
the
stomach
emerges
on
the
left
side
and
passes
downward
in
front
of
the
left
kidney
where
it
dips
into
the
pelvic
cavity
and
ends
in
the
rectum
if
fecal
matters
are
retained
until
they
are
decomposed
great
injury
follows
since
the
fluid
portions
are
absorbed
conveyed
into
the
blood
and
of
necessity
corrupt
it
with
their
impurities
in
this
way
constipation
may
be
the
source
of
general
derangement
but
disorder
is
seldom
attributed
to
the
torpid
state
of
this
intestine
there
is
little
doubt
but
that
it
thereby
imposes
a
great
tax
upon
the
functions
of
the
liver
and
frequently
the
fault
is
attributed
to
that
organ
instead
of
the
large
intestine
sometimes
the
blood
becomes
so
charged
with
fecal
matter
that
its
odor
can
be
detected
in
the
breath
of
the
subject
an
overloaded
condition
of
the
large
intestine
may
cause
inflammation
of
the
liver
or
dropsy
of
the
abdomen
when
the
colon
is
distended
it
becomes
a
mechanical
impediment
to
the
free
circulation
of
the
blood
in
other
organs
and
causes
congestion
of
the
portal
system
predisposing
to
chronic
inflammation
or
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
this
latter
is
a
structural
affection
and
may
in
turn
give
rise
to
abdominal
dropsy
in
a
word
the
accumulation
of
feces
in
the
colon
irritates
both
the
large
and
small
intestines
thus
causing
congestion
of
the
bowels
liver
or
stomach
the
protracted
presence
of
feculent
matter
deadens
the
sensibility
of
the
intestine
so
that
great
stimulation
is
required
to
provoke
it
to
action
the
contents
become
dry
solid
knotty
and
hard
and
very
difficult
to
evacuate
if
drastic
irritating
physic
be
taken
only
relief
is
afforded
and
it
must
be
repeatedly
resorted
to
and
the
dose
increased
to
obtain
the
desired
effect
symptoms
one
diagnostic
symptom
of
a
loaded
state
of
the
colon
is
an
abundant
secretion
of
urine
as
limpid
as
water
the
direct
symptoms
relate
to
the
hardness
of
the
feces
and
the
great
difficulty
of
voiding
them
the
influence
of
constipation
upon
the
functions
of
the
liver
is
indicated
by
the
sympathy
displayed
between
that
organ
and
the
mind
the
patient
manifests
apprehension
mental
depression
taciturnity
and
melancholy
all
indicative
of
hypochondriac
dejection
induced
by
constipation
we
have
treated
patients
who
from
this
cause
had
renounced
their
bright
hopes
lost
their
buoyant
spirits
and
becoming
subject
to
superstitious
fears
had
given
themselves
up
night
and
day
to
devotions
and
penance
it
often
happens
that
the
victims
of
this
deep
dejection
and
morbid
feeling
of
are
persons
not
only
of
good
moral
character
but
of
high
religious
attainments
and
their
painful
exhibitions
of
fear
distrust
and
gloom
originate
in
rather
than
in
spiritual
causes
it
is
interesting
to
witness
this
strange
perversion
of
the
imagination
this
morbid
debasement
of
the
religious
faculties
and
dejection
of
mind
due
to
causes
disturbing
the
functions
of
the
liver
and
other
vital
organs
young
girls
as
they
approach
the
age
of
puberty
seem
possessed
with
the
idea
that
the
unfrequent
action
of
the
bowels
is
a
desirable
habit
they
do
not
associate
with
the
duty
a
proper
regard
for
health
but
consider
it
as
an
inelegant
and
repugnant
practice
the
consequence
is
that
at
this
susceptible
period
constipation
induced
by
neglect
arouses
a
latent
hepatic
or
pulmonary
disease
which
has
been
lurking
in
the
system
how
many
girls
illustrate
the
truth
of
this
statement
by
their
complaints
of
dizziness
throbbing
pain
in
the
forehead
and
temples
flushing
of
the
face
transient
flushes
of
heat
over
the
body
while
at
the
same
time
the
extremities
are
cold
at
other
times
they
manifest
the
evils
of
such
a
course
by
their
stupor
drowsiness
and
deep
sleep
although
upon
arising
in
the
morning
they
are
still
tired
and
unrefreshed
the
constipated
condition
of
the
bowels
often
leads
to
congestion
of
the
uterus
and
leucorrhea
followed
by
uterine
debility
prolapsus
excessive
menstruation
anteversion
or
retroversion
of
that
organ
the
infrequency
of
the
habit
incorrectly
supposed
to
be
desirable
by
a
young
woman
becomes
nearly
if
not
quite
disastrous
to
all
her
desires
and
bright
prospects
complications
arise
and
neither
the
inexperienced
girl
nor
her
solicitous
and
afflicted
parents
know
where
to
look
for
remedial
aid
if
they
seek
an
asylum
from
these
sufferings
they
find
many
private
institutions
where
flattering
expectations
of
speedy
recovery
are
aroused
at
such
institutions
these
uterine
disorders
are
generally
treated
merely
as
local
diseases
while
the
causes
are
overlooked
and
consequently
a
permanent
cure
is
not
effected
having
spent
nearly
all
the
money
at
her
command
the
patient
returns
home
utterly
disheartened
after
such
failures
many
of
these
unfortunate
individuals
have
applied
to
us
and
received
treatment
and
by
persistently
following
our
directions
have
in
due
time
been
restored
to
health
amid
all
the
comforts
of
home
and
among
friends
who
rejoiced
with
them
in
the
unexpectedly
favorable
turn
of
affairs
accomplished
at
a
comparatively
trifling
expense
we
have
seen
infants
and
also
young
children
in
whom
constipation
was
obstinate
it
therefore
seems
that
it
is
often
hereditary
in
some
persons
this
affection
continues
from
childhood
with
but
little
variation
until
bleeding
pile
tumors
are
developed
habitual
constipation
of
the
bowels
for
a
long
period
of
years
will
generate
a
class
of
diseases
which
are
often
very
serious
in
their
results
causes
we
have
already
alluded
to
a
sense
of
false
modesty
which
prevents
a
response
to
the
calls
of
nature
and
we
may
mention
other
reasons
equally
trifling
which
deter
many
from
fulfilling
its
demands
some
are
in
the
habit
of
temporarily
postponing
their
visits
to
the
water
closet
until
when
they
do
go
they
find
themselves
unable
to
evacuate
the
bowels
sometimes
the
closet
is
a
damp
uncomfortable
situated
at
a
distance
from
the
dwelling
or
the
access
is
too
public
and
hence
there
is
an
unwillingness
to
visit
it
at
the
proper
time
some
appear
to
be
too
indolent
to
attend
to
this
duty
others
are
too
energetic
and
think
they
can
not
take
the
time
until
they
have
finished
some
task
or
attended
to
a
pressing
engagement
inactive
life
and
sedentary
occupations
are
also
causes
of
constipation
active
exercise
promotes
all
the
bodily
functions
and
helps
to
regulate
the
bowels
those
who
are
engaged
in
literary
pursuits
find
that
mental
occupation
determines
the
blood
to
the
brain
thus
drawing
it
from
the
extremities
the
temperature
falls
below
the
natural
standard
and
there
is
almost
invariably
congestion
of
the
bowels
the
inmates
of
factory
girls
seamstresses
milliners
employés
in
manufacturing
establishments
and
all
who
sit
and
toil
almost
unremittingly
twelve
hours
in
the
day
do
not
get
sufficient
exercise
of
all
the
muscles
of
the
body
and
are
often
troubled
with
obstinate
constipation
food
prepared
according
to
the
modern
modes
of
cookery
is
one
of
the
causes
which
favors
the
developement
of
this
derangement
people
live
too
exclusively
upon
bolted
wheat
flour
the
branny
portion
of
a
kernel
of
wheat
consists
of
various
nutritive
elements
with
more
than
five
times
the
amount
of
phosphate
of
lime
contained
in

do

intimations

promptly
respond
to
her
calls
if
there
is
constipation
overcome
it
by
establishing
the
habit
of
making
daily
efforts
to
effect
a
movement
of
the
bowels
taking
regular
exercise
by
walking
and
lightly
percussing
or
kneading
the

for
five
minutes
daily
help
to
increase
their
activity
the
habit
of
early
rising
favors
the
natural
action
of
the

drinking
a
glass
of
water
on
rising
exerts
a
beneficial
influence
the
food
should
be
such
as
will
excite
the
mucous
secretion
of
the
large
intestines
and
arouse
its
muscles
to
action
for
this
purpose
there
is
no
one
article
that
excels
boiled
wheat
graham
bread
mush
cakes
gems
and
all
articles
of
diet
made
from
unbolted
wheat
flour
are
valuable
auxiliaries
and
may
be
prepared
to
suit
the
taste
take
the

at

be
punctual
in
attendance
regular
in
eating
and
thoroughly
masticate
your

irregularity
in

disturbs
the
functions
of

the
use
of
ripe
fruits
such
as
apples
pears
grapes
figs
and
prunes
in
proper
quantities
is
sometimes
very
beneficial
trivial
or
unimportant
as
these
hygienic
suggestions
may
appear
yet
were
they
observed
constipation
as
well
as
most
of
the
diseases
incident
to
it
would
be
obviated
a
large
proportion
of
the
cases
will
yield
to
the
foregoing
hygienic
treatment
without
the
employment
of
medicines
should
it
be
necessary
however
to
employ
an
aperient
to
relieve
the
constipation
pierce
golden
medical
discovery
will
act
most
congenially
and
will
be
followed
by
no
constipating
reaction
which
invariably
occurs
when
drastic
cathartics
are
employed
its
operation
is
mild
bringing
about
a
healthy
action
by
promoting
the
biliary
and
other
secretions
thus
aiding
nature
in
establishing
normal
functional
activity
in
the
bowels
recourse
should
be
had
to
it
before
employing
any
thing
more
strongly
cathartic
however
should
it
prove
too
mild
in
its
aperient
effects
small
doses
of
pierce
pleasant
pellets
may
be
employed
daily
to
assist
it
unlike
other
cathartics
they
produce
a
secondary
tonic
effect
upon
the
bowels
which
renders
their
influence
more
lasting
than
that
of
other
purgatives
we
can
not
too
strongly
discourage
the
injurious
custom
which
many
people
have
of
frequently
out
their
bowels
with
strong
cathartics
it
is
a
bad
practice
and
can
not
fail
to
do
injury
the
greatest
benefit
is
derived
not
from
cathartic
doses
but
from
taking
only
one
or
two
of
the
pellets
per
day
or
enough
to
keep
the
bowels
regular
and
continuing
their
use
for
several
weeks
in
connection
with
golden
medical
discovery
strictly
carrying
out
the
hygienic
treatment
heretofore
advised
the
medical
treatment
of
individual
cases
sometimes
involves
many
considerations
relative
to
the
particular
circumstances
and
complications
presented
the
peculiar
susceptibility
of
the
constitution
as
well
as
the
diseases
incident
to
constipation
must
be
taken
into
account
symptomatic
derangement
should
not
be
treated
as
primary
although
it
is
by
inexperienced
physicians
if
the
patient
be
afflicted
with

piles
nervous
affections

we
would
advise

to
submit
all

or
those
that
do
not
yield

not
assume
the
great
responsibility
and
the
dire
consequences
which
are
very
liable
to
arise
from
the

of

we
have
been
called
upon

treat
thousands
of

of
this
troublesome
affection
and
as
a

of
our
vast
experience
and
in

of
our
original
and
improved
methods
of
diagnosis
it
is
not
generally
necessary
that
we
should
see
and
examine

can
almost
always
determine
the
exact
nature
of
the

piles
hemorrhoids
there
are
few
maladies
more
common
than
this
and
few
which
are
more
annoying
piles
consist
of
tumors
formed
within
the
rectum
and
about
the
anus
by
dilatation
of
the
hemorrhoidal
veins
and
thickening
of
their
walls
sometimes
when
attended
by
considerable
inflammation
or
when
the
attacks
are
very
frequent
there
is
thickening
of
the
adjacent
cellular
and
mucous
tissues
there
are
two
general
forms
of
this
disease
the
external
or
blind
piles
in
which
the
tumors
are
outside
the
anus
and
the
internal
or
bleeding
piles
in
which
the
tumors
are
formed
within
the
sphincters
although
after
their
formation
they
may
protrude
the
external
piles
are
commonly
made
up
of
thick
tissues
upon
one
side
the
skin

the
covering
while
on
the
inner
surface
is
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
bowel
it
is
this
surface
which
is
most
tender
and
irritable
and
liable
to
inflammation
the
internal
form
of
the
disease
is
situated
from
a
half
an
inch
to
two
and
a
half
inches
above
the
sphincter
muscle
of
the
anus
the
tumors
are
usually
round

be
scattered

sex
aside

there
is
a
tendency

it

that

piles
internal
and
symptoms
the
most
common
symptoms
at
first
are
slight
uneasiness
such
as
a
little
soreness
or
itching
at
the
verge
of
the
anus
and
at
times
lancinating
pains
these
sensations
are
more
severe
as
a
rule
if
the
bowels
are
constipated
if
the
piles
are
external
they
frequently
become
inflamed
swollen
and
painful
and
in
some
instances
they
suppurate
which
usually
results
in
relief
when
internal
piles
have
increased
to
any
considerable
extent
or
have
become
inflamed
they
produce
not
only
itching
at
the
extremity
of
the
bowel
pain
in
the
back
but
also
a
sensation
of
fullness
in
the
rectum
as
though
some
foreign
body
were
present
and
on
action
of
the
bowels
there
is
a
sensation
as
though
a
portion
of
the
fæces
had
not
been
expelled
when
the
internal
piles
become
large
they
frequently
come
down
with
fæcal
matter
from
the
bowel
as
illustrated
in
fig
and
this
prolapsus
becomes
more
and
more
marked
with
the
progress
of
the
disease
until
in
many
cases
the
tumors
are
forced
down
at
each
action
of
the
bowels
causing
excruciating
pain
until
they
are
properly
replaced
usually
in
the
early
stages
they
recede
spontaneously
however
after
a
time
it
becomes
necessary
for
the
sufferer
to
press
them
back
but
in
some
instances
this
is
impossible
frequently
during
the
protrusion
one
of
the
hemorrhoidal
veins
gives
away
and
this
is
followed
by
a
free
escape
of
blood
and
ulceration
may
ensue
not
infrequently
with
this
disease
the
patient
loses
strength
and
flesh
and
the
face
becomes
pale
and
puffy
assuming
a
waxy
appearance
many
times
there
is
nausea
with

is
consequence
of
the
relaxation
the
bowel
may
descend
when
on

feet
or
with
some
extra
muscular
effort
especially
when
stooping
these
symptoms
may
not
all
be
present
in
one
person
and
indeed
sometimes
are
somewhat
obscure
when
such
is
the
case
an
examination
by
a
competent
physician
will
always
determine
the
true

by

hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
suffer
untold
tortures
from
them
because
of
the
popular
impression
that

not

can

it
will
therefore
become
apparent
that
the
avoidance
of
causes
is
of
paramount
importance
some
of
these
causes
are
external
and
wholly
under
the
control
of
the
patient

others
depend
upon

some
years
since

remedies
which
in

to
other
virtues
possessed

efficacious
in

therefore
in

upon
which
the

depend
as
a
congested

in

the

to
inject

various
methods
have
been
in
use
by
the
profession
for
the
relief
of
the
most
severe
cases
the
most
common
is
excision
with
the
knife
or
scissors
reference
to
the
large
vessels
shown
in
fig
which
are
affected
in
this
disease
will
at
once
show
the
sufferer
the
dangers
of
this
method
the
sudden
removal
of
a
tumor
which
is
connected
with
one
or
more
of
the
large
hemorrhoidal
veins
is
sure
to
be
followed
by
severe
hemorrhage
and
many
times
painful
ulceration
and
a
fatal
result
to
avoid
this
it
has
been
the
practice
of
many
physicians
to
apply
caustics
or
to
burn
off
the
base
of
the
tumors
with
a
iron
a
more
barbarous
and
painful
method
could
not
be
devised
when
it
is
considered
that
in
many
cases
this
severe
and
painful
treatment
is
followed
by
ulceration
and
occasionally
by
the
developement
of
cancer
the
matter
should
be
carefully
weighed
before
any
such
dangerous
procedure
is
attempted
another
common
method
of
treatment
is
to
crush
the
base
of
the
pile
with
a
clamp
and
then
cut
off
the
tumors
with
scissors
after
this
it
is
also
necessary
to
apply
the
hot
iron
to
prevent
hemorrhage
formerly
applications
of
nitric
acid
were
in
common
use
by
physicians
as
a
means
of
cure
but
it
was
found
that
while
this
treatment
would
give
temporary
relief
yet
in
no
severe
case
would
it
effect
a
cure
by
what
we
term
palliative
treatment
alone
more
cures
are
effected
than
by
the
old
process
of
treatment
with
nitric
acid
still
another
form
of
treatment
is
strangulation
of
the
pile
by
means
of
a
ligature
and
this
is
often
more
painful
than
the
application
of
hot
irons
inasmuch
as
in
cutting
off
the
return
flow
of
blood
from
the
piles
a
large
tumor
is
left
for
days
fully
distended
and
extremely
painful
it
does
not
slough
off
for
a
considerable
time
and
we
have
seen
the
strongest
men
suffer
intensely
to
whom
the
use
of
scissors
in
removing
the
tumors
was
a
positive
relief
in
comparison
with
the
torture
of
the
ligature
a
treatment
that
has
been
highly
recommended
by
some
physicians
and
condemned
by
others
is
the
process
of
injection
with
carbolic
acid
this
method
of
treatment
is
not
very
painful
but
unfortunately
it
is
dangerous
the
injection
of
the
tumors
with
a
fluid
which
causes
coagulation
of
the
blood
and
which
does
not
completely
shut
off
the
return
current
of
the
circulation
through
the
tumors
has
proved
fatal
in
a
small
percentage
of
cases
the
clots
which
are
formed
by
this
treatment
become
detached
and
are
carried
into
the
general
circulation
and
conveyed
to
the
liver
lungs
and
even
to
the
brain
where
by
plugging
up
the
vessels
of
those
organs
they
cause
abscesses
which
terminate
life
serious
inflammation
of
the
veins
is
another
accident
which
often
follows
the
injection
of
carbolic
acid
this
treatment
is
therefore
now
seldom
resorted
to
except
by
physicians
who
do
not
appreciate
its
dangers
a
more
successful
method
fortunately
for
suffering
humanity
a
method
of
treatment
has
been
perfected
and
thoroughly
tested
in
our
institution
in
which
all
such
trouble
and
danger
as
above
described
are
avoided
this
consists
in
bringing
down
the
tumors
cleansing
them
and
making
application
of
certain
chemical
preparations
that
cause
the
tumors
to
speedily
shrivel
up
and
in
a
very
short
time
say
ten
to
fourteen
days
disappear
entirely
these
treatments
and
applications
cause
pain
for
by
first
applying
a
weak
solution
of
cocaine
to
the
parts
they
are
speedily
rendered
entirely
insensible
so
that
the
most
sensitive
nervous
lady
experiences
not
the
slightest
suffering
from
the
application
of
our
remedies
having
now
at
our
command
means
so
positively
certain
in
their
action
upon
pile
tumors
we
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
the
very
worst
cases
no
matter
of
how
long
standing
can
be
promptly
cured
if
we
can
only
have
the
patient
for
a
few
days
under
our
personal
care
considering
the
very
distressing
character
of
pile
tumors
it
is
a
great
boon
that
we
have
at
last
found
safe
painless
and
positively
certain
means
for
their
cure
the
news
will
be
hailed
with
joy
by
a
large
class
of
sufferers
probably
no
other
discovery
in
modern
science
is
destined
to
be
the
means
of
conferring
greater
blessings
on
a
large
class
of
sufferers
than
that
of
a
painless
and
positive
method
of
curing
the
largest
pile
tumors
in
the
brief
time
required
by
our
system
of
treating
them
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
no
longer
an
excuse
for
any
one
to
endure
the
tortures
inflicted
by
pile
tumors
provided
the
afflicted
one
can
command
the
little
time
and
moderate
amount
of
means
necessary
to
secure
the
treatment
indicated
piles
are
not
only
in
and
of
themselves
very
painful
and
annoying
but
often
greatly
aggravate
and
even
cause
other
grave
and
painful
affections
and
should
therefore
not
be
neglected
when
large
they
never
get
well
without
proper
treatment
we
have
seen
many
cases
in
which
the
long
train
of
diverse
and
distressing
symptoms
caused
by
piles
led
the
sufferer
and
even
the
family
physician
to
suppose
that
other
diseases
existed
but
all
of
which
annoying
symptoms
were
speedily
dispelled
by
the
cure
of
the
piles
we
have
no
doubt
that
neglected
piles
fistulæ
and
other
morbid
conditions
of
the
lower
bowels
frequently
degenerate
into
cancerous
disease
we
have
the
eminent
authority
of
hughes
bennett
of
edinburg
and
many
other
close
observers
for
saying
that
benign
or
ordinary
tumors
often
degenerate
into
real
cancerous
disease
and
our
own
extensive
observation
convinces
us
that
this
is
not
infrequently
a
result
of
neglected
rectal
disease
as
piles
fistulæ
and
fissures
how
important
then
to
give
prompt
attention
and
skillful
treatment
to
disease
of
these
parts
when
the
ordinary
palliative
treatment
with
ointments
and
with
laxative
agents
to
keep
the
bowels
soluble
does
not
and
subdue
the
malady
lose
no
time
in
securing
the
most
skillful
appliances
that
every
vestige
of
the
affection
may
be
promptly
removed
we
have
treated
many
thousands
of
cases
with
uniform
success
and
our
patients
write
to
us
expressing
the
greatest
degree
of
satisfaction
and
recommending
our
method
most
highly
reports
of
a
few
cases
selected
at
random
from
the
large
number
which
we
have
cured
are
given
below
to
illustrate
our
success
in
curing
them
anal
fistula
fistula
in
ano
this
disease
is
than
piles
though
after
once
formed
not
so
painful
it
sometimes
commences
with
intense
itching
about
the
anus
accompanied
with
a
little
discharge
or
the
first
symptom
may
be
a
painful
abscess
like
a
boil
which
finally
breaks
the
soreness
then
in
a
measure
subsides
leaving
a
fistulous
opening
with
a
continuous
discharge
of
matter
this
unnatural
opening
with
its
constant
drain
upon
the
system
sooner
or
later
is
certain
to
ruin
the
health
or
develop
consumption
or
other
maladies
and
destroy
life
fistula
in
ano
may
exist
in
three
conditions
first
complete
fistula
when
the
opening
is
continuous
from
the
cavity
of
the
rectum
or
bowel
to
the
surface
of
the
skin
so
that
liquids
gases
escape
secondly
internal
incomplete
fistula
when
the
opening
extends
from
the
inside
of
the
rectum
into
the
tissues
surrounding
it
but
not
through
the
skin
a
few
cases
of
this
kind
exist
while
the
sufferers
are
unconscious
of
the
nature
of
the
difficulty
supposing
it
to
be
piles
or
some
trouble
they
know
not
what
thirdly
external
incomplete
fistula
when
the
opening
extends
through
the
skin
into
the
tissues
around
the
rectum
but
does
not
enter
the
bowel
other
complications
such
as
pendulous
tits
or
projections
from
to
one
and
a
half
inches
in
length
are
attendant
upon
fistula
two
or
more
openings
may
appear
in
the
skin
all
communicating
with
the
same
sinus
or
opening
into
the
rectum
sometimes
only
a
small
external
opening
is
seen
while
a
large
abscess
exists
internally
in
any
case
the
discharge
is
not
only
reducing
to
the
system
but
it
is
disgusting
and
offensive
causes
the
causes
are
a
constitutional
predisposition
constipation
piles
or
the
presence
of
foreign
bodies
in
the
rectum
causing
an
abscess
or
ulcer
some
authors
have
contended
that
fistula
always
originates
from
an
ulcer
in
the
rectum
which
gradually
makes
its
way
through
the
cellular
tissue
to
the
surface
others
contend
that
the
cause
of
this
disease
consists
in
an
abscess
which
burrows
in
the
tissues
and
makes
its
exit
into
the
rectum
or
through
the
skin
or
both
no
doubt
it
may
originate
in
both
ways
it
can
readily
be
seen
that
when
an
internal
opening
is
once
established
the
which
enter
into
it
must
sooner
or
later
work
their
way
to
the
surface
burrowing
through
those
parts
which
offer
the
least
resistance
until
a
place
of
exit
is
reached
diagnosis
the
disease
may
be
suspected
if
there
has
been
an
abscess
in
the
parts
involved
or
if
the
patient
has
been
subject
to
pain
in
the
rectum
and
the
parts
are
tender
tumid
or
indurated
when
the
fistula
opens
externally
the
linen
will
be
moistened
and
soiled
with
pus
or
a
bloody
fluid
and
when
the
tract
is
large
the
may
pass
through
it
a
careful
exploration
with
a
probe
passed
into
the
external
opening
while
the
finger
is
in
the
rectum
generally
reveals
the
direction
of
the
tract
but
sometimes
in
consequence
of
the
tortuous
course
of
the
canal
the
probe
can
not
he
made
to
follow
it
when
the
fistula
is
incomplete
and
opens
internally
the
probe
is
passed
into
the
rectum
and
directed
outwards
when
it
may
be
felt
externally
in
such
cases
a
tumor
caused
by
the
contents
of
the
fistula
may
generally
be
seen
protruding
near
the
anus
and
the
pain
will
be
considerably
increased
during
defecation
by
the
passing
into
it
and
disturbing
its
walls
the
examination
should
be
made
with
the
greatest
possible
care
for
it
is
attended
with
more
or
less
pain
treatment
when
constitutional
derangement
exists
it
must
be
rectified
or
any
treatment
will
be
liable
to
result
in
failure
the
comfort
of
the
patient
may
be
greatly
promoted
by
attention
to
the
bowels
keeping
their
contents
in
a
soluble
condition
and
the
liver
active
so
as
to
prevent
congestion
of
the
rectum
and
adjacent
structures
this
can
best
be
done
by
careful
attention
to
hygiene
and
the
use
of
golden
medical
discovery
and
pellets
in
sufficient
quantities
to
produce
the
above
named
effects
a
however
can
not
be
accomplished
except
by
surgical
means
for
which
we
have
the
ligature
caustic
stimulating
injections
which
may
be
varied
to
suit
the
emergency
but
which
should
never
be
employed
except
by
a
competent
surgeon
constitutional
conditions
materially
influence
the
cure
no
matter
what
procedure
is
adopted
the
greater
the
constitutional
derangement
and
the
poorer
the
general
health
the
longer
is
the
cure
delayed
the
great
secret
of
our
success
in
treating
this
disease
consists
in
applying
appropriate
constitutional
treatment
at
the
same
time
the
use
of
the
knife
is
becoming
obsolete
and
has
to
a
great
extent
given
way
to
other
measures
which
are
equally
successful
indeed
other
means
will
succeed
in
cases
in
which
the
knife
fails
or
is
for
any
reason
inapplicable
one
great
objection
to
the
knife
is
not
only
the
dread
which
patients
entertain
of
it
but
the
great
liability
of
its
use
to
result
in
paralysis
of
the
sphincters
of
the
anus
the
consequence
of
which
is
loss
of
control
over
the
bowels
and
another
is
that
it
sometimes
entirely
fails
to
result
in
cure
by
the
means
which
we
employ
these
objections
are
entirely
overcome
and
while
the
general
system
is
being
renovated
the
fistula
is
healed
without
any
complications
fistula
is
much
more
common
than
has
generally
been
supposed
it
is
apt
to
be
associated
with
pulmonary
diseases
heretofore
it
has
been
supposed
that
to
heal
the
fistula
during
the
progress
of
the
lung
affection
would
result
in
fatal
consequences
and
the
patient
has
been
left
to
suffer
and
die
under
the
combined
influence
of
the
diseases
observation
based
upon
an
extensive
experience
in
the
management
of
such
diseases
has
proved
that
supposition
to
be
fallacious
in
every
respect
and
we
would
urge
all
persons
afflicted
with
fistula
to
have
the
affliction
cured
no
matter
what
complications
may
exist
the
fact
underlying
this
erroneous
opinion
is
that
when
grave
constitutional
troubles
have
the
use
of
the
knife
has
resulted
in
failure
and
the
fistula
has
refused
to
heal
having
had
ample
facilities
for
observing
the
relative
merits
of
the
various
methods
of
treating
this
complaint
in
hundreds
of
eases
in
our
own
practice
and
that
of
others
we
feel
justified
in
saying
that
the
plan
which
we
have
adopted
is
far
superior
to
that
in
general
use
the
local
treatment
which
we
employ
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
fistula
in
some
instances
the
ligature
is
best
in
others
caustics
and
again
injection
while
still
others
require
a
combination
of
two
or
more
methods
or
a
modification
of
them
in
cases
in
which
it
is
impossible
for
the
patient
to
come
to
our
hotel
for
a
radical
and
speedy
cure
of
the
fistula
we
employ
constitutional
treatment
with
the
use
of
a
medicated
crayon
which
is
similar
in
shape
to
a
small
slate
pencil
this
crayon
is
made
of
gelatine
with
the
remedial
agents
thoroughly
incorporated
through
it
and
in
an
easily
soluble
form
they
are
very
flexible
and
readily
used
and
where
the
fistulous
track
is
sufficiently
large
to
admit
of
their
insertion
the
most
decided
improvement
invariable
follows
their
application
one
is
oiled
and
gently
introduced
into
the
track
every
two
or
three
days
and
by
its
solution
the
unhealthy
tissues
which
line
the
track
are
removed
they
are
thrown
off
and
a
healthy
action
is
induced
with
careful
constitutional
treatment
decided
improvement
soon
follows
and
the
discharge
is
gradually
lessened
the
most
satisfactory
improvement
occurs
in
the
general
health
and
strength
of
the
patient
and
gradually
the
fistula
closes
sometimes
it
is
necessary
to
pursue
this
course
of
treatment
for
many
months
but
the
result
obtained
is
sufficient
reward
for
the
trouble
a
large
percentage
of
cures
follow
this
treatment
and
we
recommend
it
when
it
is
impossible
for
the
patient
to
leave
home
or
when
the
general
health
is
greatly
reduced
by
severe
constitutional
disease
testimonials
while
we
have
a
great
cloud
of
witnesses
testifying
to
the
efficacy
of
our
treatment

the
diseases
described
in
this
volume

is
case
of
chronic
diarrhea
cured
by

treatment
illustration
at
the
time
the
case
was
first
submitted
to
us
the
bowels
were
moving
six
or
eight
times
a
day
in
addition
to
the
diarrhea
the
patient
had
suffered
from
indigestion
and
womb
trouble
for
eight
years
there
was
almost
continual
pain
from
the
top
of
the
head
to
the
hips
and
through
the
shoulders
there
was
weakness
soreness
and
numbness
in
the
arms
hands
back
and
hips
the
bladder
was
irritable
urine
being
passed
frequently
or
occasionally
scanty
dark
thick
with
a
deposit
there
was
a
dragging
sensation
in
the
region
of
the
womb
menstruation
was
irregular
and
she
had
frequent
trembling
spells
lasting
for
hours
there
was
difficulty
in
fixing
the
attention
even
for
a
sufficient
length
of
time
to
write
a
brief
letter
in
fact
she
was
so
weak
and
nervous
she
could
scarcely
write
at
all
sleeplessness
was
a
prominent
feature
of
the
case
the
principal
diet
consisted
of
light
bread
and
hot
milk
could
not
use
graham
bread
a
course
of
special
treatment
was
supplied
to
her
about
the
first
of
january
but
soon
after
commencing
the
treatment
she
had
an
attack
of
pneumonia
in
due
time
the
treatment
was
resumed
and
then
followed
an
attack
of
the
epidemic
influenza
or
grip
so
that
although
the
treatment
was
carried
on
at
intervals
during
a
year
there
were
but
few
occasions
when
our
specialist
had
what
he
considered
full
control
of
the
case

was

in

my
thanks
are
due
to
you
for
eleven
years
ago
when
i
was
years
of
age
you
treated
the
pile
tumors
so
successfully
they
had
been
the
source
of
greatest
discomfort
i
think
that
they
were
caused
first
by
chronic
diarrhea
which
had
troubled
me
many
years
prior
to
their
appearance
i
was
also
afflicted
with
asthma
torpid
liver
and
constipation
these
conditions
produced
in
time
some
pile
tumors
that
were
the
source
of
much
suffering
and
seemed
to
continually
annoy
me
as
is
usual
with
such
difficulties
i
believe
i
would
be
free
from
discomfort
for
a
time
and
then
the
piles
would
get
sensitive
and
irritable
come
down
at
stool
and
gave
rise
to
severe
pain
that
seemed
to
affect
my
general
health
the
nervous
symptoms
that
resulted
from
their
presence
were
such
as
to
lead
me
to
fear
that
i
would
break
down
in
health
unless
they
were
relieved
from
information
obtained
from
others
who
had
been
relieved
at
your
hands
i
applied
to
your
institution
and
can
thankfully
assert
that
the
tumors
were
permanently
cured
as
it
has
been
eleven
years
since
your
specialist
treated
me
and
i
have
had
no
trouble
of
the
kind
and
for
an
old
lady
i
am
pretty
well
i
had
such
good
treatment
and
nice
care
at
your
institution
that
i
can
not
express
in
my
testimony
the
thanks
that
i
owe
you
wishing
you
every
success
in
the
treatment
of

that
you
may
be

some
years
since
i
was
feeling
very
miserable
all
summer
i
was
very
bilious
sometimes
my
bowels
would
not
move
once
in
sixty
to
seventy
hours
and
then
almost
impossible
i
would
take
some
bitters
which
would
help
to
move
the
matter
but
as
soon
as
the
bitters
were
gone
i
had
to
buy
more
or
i
would
be
as
bad
as
before
and
sometimes
worse
but
none
of
them
appeared
to
do
me
any
good
except
to
move
the
bowels
until
thirty
years
since
a
druggist
called
my
attention
to
your
golden
medical
discovery
and
before
i
had
taken
half
a
bottle
of
the
golden
medical
discovery
i
felt
much
better
and
by
the
time
i
had
taken
all
i
could
eat
three
hearty
meals
per
day
and
had
not
felt
so
well
for
a
long
time
soon
after
i
was
called
to
do
a
job
some
miles
from
home
and
one
night
the
old
lady
there
was
speaking
about
her
daughter
brooks
who
had
been
under
the
doctor
care
for
about
five
months
and
did
not
get
any
better
and
i
learned
by
asking
a
few
questions
that
she
had
no
appetite
and
no
ambition
to
do
anything
then
i
told
her
what
the
golden
medical
discovery
had
done
for
me
the
next
day
the
old
lady
drove
down
to
her
daughter
and
got
brooks
to
send
to
rutland
ten
miles
away
for
two
bottles
of
the
golden
medical
discovery
and
the
next
day
when
the
doctor
came
and
was
about
to
take
his
leave
brooks
told
the
doctor
he
did
not
want
him
any
more
at
present
and
would
send
for
him
if
necessary
i
saw
the
old
lady
about
ten
days
later
and
her
daughter
was
improving
and
brooks
had
great
faith
in
the
golden
medical
discovery
and
had
not
sent
for
the
doctor
but
had
gone
to
rutland
for
more
of
the
golden
medical
discovery
when
i
commenced
taking
the
golden
medical
discovery
i
thought
i
was
going
into
consumption
as
i
had
a
cough
for
three
years
or
more
and
my
weight
decreasing
my
weight
before
taking

was

mrs
winter
it
is
with
pleasure
that
i
tell
you
what
your
discovery
has
done
for
my
mother
she
was
in
poor
health
for
a
long
time
coughing
and
weak
and
thought
she
had
consumption
she
had
such
palpitation
of
the
heart
and
could
not
rest
at
night
because
of
the
palpitation
sometimes
and
then
the
right
arm
pained
her
so
at
times
that
she
hardly
knew
what
to
do
if
we
would
put
on
hot
applications
it
would
drive
it
to
the
heart
and
the
doctor
did
her
no
good
so
finally
as
a
last
resort
we
happened
to
get
hold
of
some
of
pierce
pamphlets
and
were
constrained
to
write
to
him
and
send
a
small
bottle
of
urine
for
examination
he
immediately
wrote
back
saying
it
was
liver
trouble
and
to
take
the
golden
medical
discovery
according
to
directions
she
took
it
for
two
months
when
the
pain
in
her
arm
gradually
left
her
and
she
could
comb
her
own
hair
and
began
to
be
more
cheerful
for
she
was
melancholy
before
the
palpitation
grew
less
and
less
and
she
rested
at
night
and
is
now
doing
her
own
work
for
a
family
of
five
and
is
years
old
i
have
taken
delight
in
recommending
to
others
this
wonderful
medicine
for
heart

trouble

took
a

bottles
to
effect

five
drops
of

of

have
done

two
weeks

at

taken
with

thought
he
was
surely
going
to
die
but
as
quickly
as
i
could
get
some
hot
water
i
put
hot
applications
on
his
stomach
and
bowels
and
gave
him
a
few
doses
of
your
extract
of
he
got
well

the

attended

they
decided
that

brought
on
by

my

extreme
and
the

the

that
i
tried
many
different

after
becoming
physically
incapacitated

unable
to
do
any

at

after
much

my

has

these

mild

i

get
anything
which
would
relieve
them

increased

has

relieved

just
one
year

i
was
suffering
untold
agonies
from
internal
piles
and
prolapsus
of
the

my
bodily
pain
was
so
great
that
the
mental
strain
was
almost
more
than
i
could
stand
i
was
useless
to
myself
and
family
and
had
about
persuaded
myself
it
would
be
better
to
take
my
life
and
i
think
i
should
have
done
so
had
not
a

happened
to
fall
into

i
was
not

just
what
my
trouble
was
at

what
to
call
it
i
began
the
chapter
treating
on

tumors
and
then
i
realized
just
what
my
trouble
was
i
wrote
you
and
received
encouragement
i
sent
for
a
month
treatment
and
it
was
certainly
the
best
investment
i
ever
made
i
received
the
medicines
at
noon
read
the
directions
carefully
and
commenced
at
once
to
carry
them
out
i
seemed
better
the
next
day
i
suffered
less
and
in
a
few
days
there
was
a
decided
change
for
the
better
i
continued
the
medicine
until
i
had
taken
all
of
it
i
have
not
taken
any
since
except
occasionally
a
few
of
pierce
pellets
just
enough
to
act
as
a
mild
laxative
i
am
perfectly
well
i
was
always
more
or
less
constipated
all
my
life
i
now
understand
that
by
keeping
the

open
and
in
good
order
i
could
have
avoided
all
of
the
suffering
that
i
have
gone

by
this

the

of
blood
laden
with

is
sent

out

the

the

of

are
caused
to
contract
rhythmically
and
force
along

of

so
that

may
be
taken
up
by

all

nervous
debility

exhaustion
this
affection
also
popularly
known
as
nervous
prostration
or
nervous
weakness
and
to
the
medical
profession
as
neurasthenia
or
nervous
asthenia
is
becoming
alarmingly
prevalent
the
wear
tear
and
strain
of
modern
life
are
concentrated
upon
the
nervous

the
care
and
consequent
fret
worry
and
labor
of
this
age
are
greater
than
ever
before
known
the
result
of
this
extreme
activity
is
exhaustion
and
weakness
physical
bankruptcy
is
the
result
of
drawing
incessantly
upon
the
reserve
capital
of
nerve
force
we
extract
the
following
from
an
article
which
recently
appeared
in
the
new
york
an
age
of
nervousness
the
stone
age
the
bronze
age
and
the
iron
age
we
have
heard
of
likewise
of
the
dark
ages
and
other
eras
in
human
history
as
for
the
present
it
might
with
fitness
be
known
as
the
age
of
engineering
or
of
electricity
both
of
which
proud
titles
it
has
won
by
its
achievements
yet
there
is
also
a
less
roseate
view
to
be
taken
of
it
and
another
title
to
be
given
to
it
based
upon
its
frailties
namely
that
it
is
an
age
of
nervousness
such
is
the
view
taken
by
the
famous
psychologist
william
erb
of
the
university
of
heidelberg
nervousness
he
says
meaning
nervous
excitement
nervous
weakness
is
the
growing
malady
of
the
day
the
physiological
feature
of
the
age
hysteria
hypochondria
and
neurasthenia
are
increasing
with
fearful
rapidity
among
both
sexes
they
begin
in
childhood
if
not
indeed
inherited
minds
are
overburdened
in
school
with
too
much
teaching
or
misdirected
teaching
the
pleasures
of
social
life
follow
overexerting
the
already
enfeebled
nervous
system
business
life
is
made
up
of
hurry
and
worry
and
shocks
and
excitements
society
science
business
art
literature
even
religion
are
all
pervaded
by
a
spirit
of
unrest
and
by
a
competitive
zeal
which
urges
its
victims
on
remorselessly
no
man
knows
repose
the
result
is
wreckage
the
pharmacopoeia
is
overcrowded
with
nerve
tonics
nerve
stimulants
nerve
sedatives
the
medical
profession
devotes
its
best
energies
to
the
treatment
of
neuropaths
and
as
a
people
we
are
or
are
becoming
excitable
irritable
morbid
prone
to
sudden
collapse
through
snapping
of
the
overtense
chord
of
the
nervous
vitality
nowhere
are
the
rush
and
hurry
and
overstrain
of
life
more
marked
than
in
this
nation
the
comparative
youth
and
freshness
and
vigor
of
the
american
people
enable
them
to
do
and
to
endure
what
would
be
beyond
the
power
of
an
older
and
more
community
yet
there
is
no
disguising
the
fact
that
the
pace
tells
even
here
and
often
tells
to
kill
true
all
the
tendencies
of
the
age
are
in
that
direction
inventions
discoveries
achievements
of
science
all
add
to
the
sum
of
that
which
is
to
be
learned
and
widen
the
field
in
which
there
is
work
to
be
done
what
we
need
to
learn
is
however
that
all
these
things
are
for
man
not
man
for
them
if
knowledge
has
increased
we
should
take
more
time
for
acquiring
it
knowing
that
with
the
consequent
increase
of
power
we
shall
be
able
to
achieve
as
much
afterward
in
the
shorter
time
as
our
predecessors
did
in
the
longer
time
their
briefer
study
afforded
greater
ability
should
mean
not
only
greater
results
wrought
but
fuller
repose
as
well
for
it
would
be
a
sorry
ending
of
this
splendid
age
of
learning
and
of
labor
to
be
known
as
an
age
of
unsettled
brains
and
shattered
nerves
a
distinguished
medical
authority
says
it
is
proved
beyond
any
dispute
that
nervousness
is
the
characteristic
malady
of
the
american
nation
growing
upon
them
in
a
frightfully
accelerated
ratio
every
year
and
threatening
them
with
disasters
at
no
distant
date
which
the
mind
shrinks
from
contemplating
he
continues
as
follows
the
number
of
deaths
from
this
cause
is
already
appalling
and
is
steadily
and
rapidly
increasing
in
some
of
the
busy
centres
the
tables
of
mortality
show
that
the
proportion
of
nerve
deaths
has
multiplied
more
than
twenty
times
in
the
last
forty
years
and
that
now
the
nerve
deaths
number
more
than
of
all
the
deaths
recorded
what
is
most
shocking
in
these
returns
this
fearful
loss
of
life
occurs
mainly
among
young
people
of
both
sexes
this
means
that
the
americans
are
fast
becoming
a
very
people
and
that
if
they
were
shut
in
on
themselves
for
only
a
few
years
without
any
influx
of
vitality
by
immigration
the
publication
of
the
census
would
send
a
pang
of
horror
and
alarm
throughout
the
land
the
annual
report
of
the
state
board
of
charities
of
the
state
of
new
york
for
shows
that
while
the
increase
in
the
state
population
from
to
was
per
the
increase
of
the
insane
in
state
institutions
for
the
same
period
was
per
the
enjoyment
of
the
fruits
of
fortune
earned
at
the
expense
of
the
nerve
cells
is
an
impossibility
the
quiet
and
harmony
of
the
nerve
centres
and
nervous
system
are
gone
rest
is
impossible
continuance
of
work
only
causes
increased
jarring
and
discord
of
that
many
stringed
and
wonderful
mechanism
symptoms
it
is
well
nigh
impossible
to
give
the
symptoms
of
this
disease
in
an
orderly
manner
as
the
affection
gives
rise
to
a
thousand
and
one
varying
and
ofttimes
vague
symptoms
the
particular
part
of
the
nervous
system
affected
and
also
the
cause
and
character
of
the
attacks
modify
the
symptoms
the
eminent
wood
says
nervous
exhaustion
may
in
the
beginning
affect
the
whole
of
the
nervous
system
or
it
may
be
at
first
purely
local
and
with
lack
of
general
nervous
strength
spermatorrhea
furnishes
many
examples
of
the
local
form
of
neurasthenia
or
exhaustion
the
sexual
centres
being
primarily
affected
in
these
cases
however
sooner
or
later
the
whole
nervous
system
becomes
involved
so
in
other
forms
of
the
disorder
the
exhaustion
at
first
local
finally
if
neglected
implicates
the
whole
organism
often
in
brain
exhaustion
the
symptoms
are
at
first
purely
local
almost
always
the
cause
of
a
local
neurasthenia
or
exhaustion
is
excessive
use
of
the
part
thus
cerebral
or
brain
exhaustion
or
debility
is
usually
the
result
of
mental
overwork
while
sexual
asthenia
or
weakness
is
generally
due
to
abuse
of
the
sexual
organs
or
to
sexual
excesses
when
to
the
brain
fatigue
or
exhaustion
are
added
the
depressing
effects
of
excessive
anxiety
or
allied
emotions
the
symptoms
from
the
first
are
more
general
and
the
exhaustion
may
effect
chiefly
a
single
function
of
the
brain
in
pure
brain
exhaustion
the
loss
of
a
disposition
to
work
is
usually
the
first
symptom
the
sufferer
finding
that
it
constantly
requires
a
more
and
more
painful
effort
of
the
will
to
perform
the
allotted
task
at
first
there
is
loss
of
the
power
of
fixing
the
attention
and
this
by
and
by
is
accompanied
by
a
weakness
of
the
memory
disturbances
of
sleep
are
frequent
various
abnormal
sensations
in
the
head
are
complained
of
in
most
cases
there
is
not
absolute
headache
but
a
feeling
of
weight
or
fullness
or
an
indescribable
distress
usually
aggravated
by
mental
effort
it
is
true
that
in
some
cases
of
very
dangerous
brain
tire
mental
labor
is
performed
with
extraordinary
vigor
and
ease
the
power
of
work
is
for
the
time
markedly
increased
and
even
the
quality
of
the
product
may
be
raised
the
patient
may
glory
in
a
wild
intellectual
exaltation
a
sense
of
mental
power
with
an
almost
uncontrollable
brain
activity
it
is
probable
however
that
these
cases
are
not
instances
of
pure
neurasthenia
or
brain
exhaustion
but
that
there
is
active
congestion
of
the
gray
matter
of
the
brain
in
these
cases
the
disease
is
very
prone
to
end
in
serious
organic
affection
of
the
brain
illustration
severe
brain
exhaustion
may
be
associated
with
good
spirits
but
usually
there
is
marked
depression
and
this
perversion
of
function
generally
goes
on
if
the
disease
be
not
checked
to
decided
melancholy
the
will
power
like
all
the
other
functional
activities
of
the
brain
is
prone
to
be
weakened
morbid
fears
may
finally
develop
and
at
last
that
which
was
at
the
beginning
a
single
brain
exhaustion
may
end
in
persistent
hypochondria
followed
by
insanity
peculiar
sensations
are
common
in
neurasthenia
such
as
chilliness
unnatural
itching
a
feeling
as
though
ants
or
other
insects
were
crawling
on
the
skin
eruptions
are
common
attacks
of
neuralgia
are
often
frequent
and
sometimes
severe
being
usually
worse
in
those
persons
of
nervous
ancestry
in
some
cases
there
is
a
lack
of
proper
sensation
in
others
an
unnatural
sensitiveness
there
is
also
in
many
cases
a
peculiar
tenderness
over
some
portion
of
the
spinal
column
especially
in
women
in
women
with
nervous
disturbance
of
the
sexual
organs
there
is
frequently
great
pain
felt
during
menstruation
in
others
ovarian
irritation
and
a
irritable
or
sensitive
uterus
giving
rise
to
manifold
nervous
and
hysterical
symptoms
sometimes
culminating
in
convulsions
or
fits
in
not
a
small
proportion
of
the
uterine
diseases
which
are
generally
only
locally
treated
by
physicians
the
local
disease
is
largely
and
sometimes
solely
the
expression
of
a
general
weakness
of
nervous
origin
and
excesses
it
is
well
known
that
onanism
or
masturbation
as
well
as
sexual
excesses
produce
an
exhaustion
of
the
nerve
centres
presiding
over
the
sexual
functions
this
is
the
common
history
of
spermatorrhea
or
loss
of
the
virile
fluid
by
nightly
emissions
accompanied
by
lascivious
dreams
general
neurasthenia
or
nervous
exhaustion
may
also
produce
a
local
weakness
of
the
sexual
centres
of
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
with
symptoms
at
least
resembling
those
of
partial
impotency
and
great
irritability
of
the
sexual
organs
or
a
complete
impotence
with
premature
seminal
discharge
whenever
coition
is
attempted
many
times
this
condition
results
from
excessive
intellectual
labor
even
with
no
sexual
excesses
or
abuses
nocturnal
or
nightly
emissions
are
not
always
experienced
in
these
cases
when
they
do
occur
the
debilitating
losses
of
vital
fluid
react
upon
the
brain
robbing
the
victim
of
courage
and
manliness
and
exciting
various
phases
of
morbid
fear
and
sensitiveness
many
cases
of
nervous
debility
or
exhaustion
are
the
result
of
long
continued
malarial
poisoning
diarrhea
bright
disease
exhausting
fevers
or
other
debilitating
affections
numerous
are
the
cases
in
which
the
patient
is
able
to
trace
the
origin
of
the
malady
back
to
an
attack
of
influenza
or
grip
an
epidemic
of
the
latter
disease
is
sure
to
be
followed
by
numerous
cases
of
nervous
prostration
or
exhaustion
care
should
be
exercised
in
all
cases
it
is
necessary
to
make
careful
examinations
in
order
to
detect
any
obscure
chronic
disease
which
may
exist
in
women
nervous
prostration
often
develops
without
perceptible
cause
at
the
age
of
puberty
or
at
the
change
of
life
overwork
especially
overwork
combined
with
worry
are
fruitful
causes
of
nervous
exhaustion
in
both
sexes
an
overworked
nervous
system
is
always
an
exhausted
nervous
system
the
nerve
cells
have
been
robbed
of
their
vital
forces
all
the
nutritive
organs
of
the
body
suffer
from
the
lack
of
nerve
control
and
the
that
supply
the
nerve
centres
are
not
in
proper
tone
hence
the
supply
of
blood
and
the
action
of
the
heart
are
greatly
interfered
with
many
times
the
most
troublesome
symptom
early
in
the
disease
is
an
excessive
perspiration
of
the
hands
and
feet
impoverished
or
poor
blood
a
badly
nourished
nervous
system
is
irritable
many
of
the
symptoms
of
weakness
and
lack
of
nutrition
resemble
those
found
in
congestion
or
stimulation
from
excess
of
blood
then
too
we
find
sometimes
that
poor
thin
watery
blood
not
suitable
for
nourishment
although
sent
in
large
amount
to
the
brain
does
not
properly
nourish
that
organ
there
will
still
be
brain
exhaustion
as
the
nervous
structures
have
lost
their
power
of
absorbing
the
nutrient
materials
from
the
blood
which
being
poor
in
quality
does
not
vitalize
and
strengthen
the
nerve
centres
as
it
should
in
such
cases
thought
is
an
effort
and
sustained
mental
exertion
is
impossible
the
memory
is
uncertain
and
the
patient
drowsy
occasionally
after
rest
there
may
be
flashes
of
brilliancy
but
generally
they
are
brief
danger
of
contracting
intemperance
the
patient
often
learns
that
a
small
amount
of
wine
or
spirits
is
a
temporary
aid
and
sometimes
its
habitual
use
is
begun
in
this
way
stimulants
only
make
a
bad
matter
worse
when
their
use
is
continued
for
any
considerable
length
of
time
the
sufferer
becomes
more
and
more
dependent
upon
them
and
the
nervous
exhaustion
is
much
aggravated
as
large
quantities
are
taken
to
satisfy
the
morbid
craving
that
has
been
acquired
wakefulness
or
insomnia
is
present
in
many
cases
in
others
there
is
unusual
drowsiness
but
sleep
gives
neither
rest
nor
strength
often
it
is
disturbed
by
dreams
that
exhaust
the
vitality
and
leave
the
patient
more
tired
than
when
rest
was
sought
headache
is
one
of
the
most
annoying
symptoms
and
sometimes
is
very
persistent
it

skill
more

almost

to
the
peculiarities

all
be
taken
into

value
of
experience
only
through
extensive
experience
can
the
medical
practitioner
become
expert
at
detecting
and
successfully
meeting
by
rational
scientific
and
carefully
adapted
treatment
the
many
phases
and
complications
incident
to
the
different
forms
and
stages
of
this
very
prevalent
malady
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
the
specialists
of
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
having
charge
of
this
department
of
practice
have
been
actively
engaged
battling
with
diseases
of
the
nervous
system
as
a
result
of
this
long
time
and
vast
experience
they
have
naturally
developed
and
thoroughly
tested
many
valuable
remedial
agencies
for
the
relief
and
cure
of
this
class
of
sufferers
many
of
these
can
be
successfully
prescribed
and
used
at
the
patients
homes
without
a
personal
consultation
while
others
can
only
be
brought
into
use
at
our
institution
treatment
at
home
many
cases
especially
when
the
exciting
cause
of
the
malady
can
be
easily
ascertained
as
in
spermatorrhea
from
or
sexual
excesses
or
in
women
when
arising
from
uterine
affections
can
be
very
successfully
managed
and
cured
at
home
this
is
also
true
when
the
disease
is
due
to
the
excessive
use
of
tobacco
opium
and
other
narcotics
consultation
by
letter
the
patient
has
thought
over
his
symptoms
hundreds
of
times
the
location
of
every
discomfort
has
been
carefully
noted
these
matters
are
stated
with
accuracy
common
sense
and
good
judgment
when
writing
to
us
the
people
are
far
more
intelligent
in
these
matters
than
physicians
are
generally
willing
to
admit
a
patient
is
often
confused
while
being
personally
examined
by
a
physician
and
gives
imperfect
or
incorrect
answers
after
he
has
left
the
presence
of
the
physician
he
finds
that
he
has
failed
to
enumerate
many
of
the
most
important
symptoms
in
consulting
by
letter
the
patient
is
not
embarrassed
states
the
exact
symptoms
and
carefully
reads
over
the
letter
to
see
if
it
is
a
complete
and
accurate
description
of
his
sufferings
in
this
way
he
often
conveys
a
much
better
idea
of
the
case
than
if
present
in
person
and
subject
to
the
most
thorough
questioning
and
the
timid
lady
and
nervous
young
man
write
just
as
they
feel
and
one
reason
why
we
have
had
such
success
in
treating
intricate
and
delicate
diseases
is
because
we
have
obtained
such
true
and
natural
statements
of
the
cases
from
these
letters
many
of
which
are
perfect
pen
pictures
of
disease
as
bank
tellers
and
cashiers
who
daily
handle
large
quantities
of
currency
can
unmistakably
detect
spurious
money
by
a
glance
at
the
engraving
or
touch
of
the
paper
so
the
experienced
physician
by
his
great
familiarity
with
disease
becomes
equally
skilled
in
detecting
the
nature
and
extent
of
a
chronic
malady
from
a
written
description
of
its
symptoms
to
aid
the
patient
in
giving
a
clear
and
intelligible
history
of
his
case
we
send
when
requested
a
very
complete
question
blank
examination
of
the
urine
a
careful
microscopical
examination
and
chemical
analysis
of
the
urine
is
a
valuable
aid
in
determining
the
nature
of
these
diseases
of
the
nervous
system
this
important
fact
is
not
overlooked
at
the
hotel
and
surgical
institute
where
experienced
chemists
are
employed
to
make
such
examinations
and
report
the
result
to
the
attending
physicians
persons
consulting
us
and
desiring
to
avail
themselves
of
the
advantages
afforded
by
these
examinations
can
send
a
sample
of
their
urine
by
express
the
bottle
should
be
thoroughly
cleansed
and
should
contain
from
two
to
four
ounces
of
that
first
passed
after
arising
in
the
morning
it
should
be
carefully
packed
in
or
paper
and
inclosed
in
a
light
wooden
box
all
express
charges
must
be
prepaid
through
and
a
complete
history
of
the
case
including
the
age
and
sex
of
the
patient
should
accompany
every
package
or
it
will
receive
no
attention
this
saves
valuable
time
by
directing
the
examination
into
the
channels
indicated
and
thus
avoiding
a
lengthy
series
of
experiments
as
we
are
daily
receiving
numerous
bottles
of
urine
every
sample
to
prevent
confusion
should
be
labeled
with
the
patient
name
by
the
postal
regulations
all
liquids
are
excluded
from
the
mails
unless
packed
in
accordance
with
our
printed
directions
which
will
be
sent
free
on
request
being
received
for
them
we
aim
to
cure
not
merely
to
palliate
as
is
so
often
done
by
practitioners
in
dealing
with
these
distressing
maladies
we
do
not
prescribe
coca
mixtures
whiskey
malt
extracts
celery
compounds
or
other
nerve
stimulants
which
only
spur
the
already
weakened
nervous
system
on
as
a
man
would
urge
his
jaded
horse
to
renewed
efforts
when
the
animal
should
be
refreshed
by
proper
food
and
rest
neither
have
we
any
faith
in
lasting
good
resulting
from
prescribing
such
nerve
sedatives
as
put
the
nerves
to
sleep
and
so
by
simply
blunting
sensibility
delude
the
patient
into
the
false
belief
that
he
is
being
benefited
to
effect
a
radical
cure
of
the
weakness
the
nerve
centres
must
be
restored
to
a
normal
condition
by
improving
the
nutrition
of
the
nerve
cells
to
do
this
the
causes
of
the
difficulty
must
be
understood
and
any
local
weakness
or
disease
of
any
organ
be
it
the
liver
kidneys
lungs
stomach
rectum
bladder
or
generative
organs
must
be
understood
properly
treated
and
overcome
the
desire
for
alcoholic
stimulants
is
a
most
common
and
dangerous
tendency
of
the
disease
to
gratify
the
morbid
appetite
for
stimulants
is
to
do
the
patient
lasting
injury
impoverished
blood
in
some
cases
the
nervous
affection
is
the
result
of
an
impure
or
impoverished
condition
of
the
blood
in
such
cases
the
use
of
pierce
golden
medical
discovery
has
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
resulted
in
an
immediate
benefit
and
gradually
in
a
permanent
restoration
of
the
nerve
centres
to
a
normal
condition
this
remedy
particularly
if
assisted
by
the
use
of
pierce
pleasant
pellets
when
constipation
is
present
unloads
the
liver
and
their
combined
action
tends
to
remove
from
the
blood
the
poisons
which
it
is
the
function
of
the
liver
to
take
from
that
fluid
the
cells
of
the
brain
after
performing
their
function
throw
into
the
blood
certain
poisonous
materials
which
it
is
the
function
of
the
liver
to
remove
if
this
is
not
done
the
cells
become
clogged
and
can
only
be
restored
to
a
natural
and
healthful
condition
by
increasing
the
activity
of
the
liver
this
treatment
gives
rise
to
an
immediate
improvement
and
a
continuance
of
the
remedies
results
in
a
gradual
toning
up
of
the
nervous
system
and
relief
from
the
unpleasant
symptoms
female
weakness
many
women
suffer
from
nervous
prostration
or
exhaustion
owing
to
congestion
of
the
uterus
and
ovaries
caused
by
again
by
overwork
the
strain
of
too
many
household
cares
or
too
frequent
childbirths
in
these
cases
the
use
of
pierce
favorite
prescription
is
of
the
greatest
benefit
tending
to
restore
the
uterus
and
ovaries
to
a
normal
condition
its
wonderful
restorative
effects
tonic
and
nerve
invigorating
properties
especially
adapt
it
to
the
cure
of
these
cases
digestion
and
assimilation
of
food
are
promoted
by
its
use
when
the
liver
or
blood
is
not
in
healthful
condition
as
previously
referred
to
the
golden
medical
discovery
should
be
used
in
conjunction
with
the
prescription
if
menstruation
be
scanty
pierce
pellets
will
have
a
beneficial
influence
in
increasing
the
flow
and
overcoming
the
headache
and
congestion
of
internal
organs
that
is
the
result
of
scanty
menstruation
especially
if
their
use
be
accompanied
with
full
doses
of
pierce
compound
extract
of
local
causes
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
when
nervous
prostration
has
made
its
appearance
at
intervals
with
periods
of
prolonged
good
health
intervening
but
in
which
as
a
rule
slight
excesses
or
the
attacks
of
some
acute
disease
produces
a
nervous
exhaustion
we
have
found
that
local
derangement
is
the
cause
of
the
whole
trouble
this
cause
may
often
be
readily
removed
and
a
perfect
and
permanent
restoration
of
the
health
will
follow
in
men
we
have
often
found
a
varicocele
to
be
the
cause
of
nervous
prostration
in
others
rupture
or
urethral
stricture
sometimes
of
a
character
so
mild
as
hardly
to
give
serious
inconvenience
has
been
the
cause
in
women
ulceration
of
the
uterus
stricture
of
the
cervix
congestion
or
other
diseases
of
the
ovaries
such
as
cysts
abscesses
inflammation
of
the
fallopian
tubes
characterized
with
more
or
less
periodical
discomfort
and
attacks
of
leucorrhea
or
whites
are
common
causes
in
all
cases
in
which
the
nervous
disease
depends
upon
local
causes
we
find
that
the
relief
of
the
local
source
of
irritation
which
tends
to
reduce
the
general
health
and
interfere
with
perfect
nervous
tone
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
give
the
invalid
a
perfect
restoration
to
health
vigor
and
activity
it
is
like
removing
the
burden
from
a
tired
horse
who
has
fallen
prostrate
under
an
excessive
load
the
removal
of
the
burden
puts
the
individual
under
a
favorable
condition
for
the
immediate
restoration
to
health
and
strength
and
permanent
relief
is
only
a
matter
of
a
few
days
or
weeks
time
with
appropriate
nourishment
and
restorative
nerve
tonics
alcohol
opium
and
tobacco
affect
different
individuals
according
to
their
several
susceptibilities
some
are
able
to
withstand
with
apparent
impunity
an
amount
of
these
that
can
not
be
tolerated
by
others
without
great
injury
no
one
however
is
wholly
proof
against
these
unwholesome
agents
which
are
in
such
common
use
the
sad
results
of
their
excessive
use
are
seen
in
thousands
of
cases
of
shattered
nerves
and
wasted
vigor
the
excessive
use
of
tea
and
coffee
is
also
a
prolific
cause
of
nervous
affections
happily
we
have
now
at
our
command
remedies
which
exercise
a
most
potent
controlling
influence
over
the
acquired
morbid
appetite
for
these
narcotics
and
stimulants
of
course
we
have
to
depend
to
some
extent
upon
the
will
power
of
the
patient
but
where
this
is
not
wholly
lost
we
have
in
all
our
later
experience
been
able
to
realize
a
degree
of
success
which
has
been
alike
gratifying
to

of
the
specialist
treating
nervous
diseases
are
now
a
recognized
necessity
physicians
and
sufferers
alike
appreciate
this
fact
public
hospitals
do
not
answer
this
purpose
owing
to
the
fact
that
they
are
more

intended

the
alleviation
of

this
true
in

of

injection
of
these

has
in

many

thus
been
obtained

are
turned
out

wanted
which
is
important
as
all
such
preparations
no
matter
how
carefully
made
and
put
up
deteriorate
with
age
these
extracts
are
made
from
the
glands
and
organs
of
the
lower
animals
as
from
the
brain
spinal
cord
heart
testicles

and
some
other
organs
and

of
bullocks

and
other

that
they
possess
properties
which
exert
most
potent
tonic
or
invigorating
influences
upon
those
organs
and
parts
of
the
human
system
corresponding
to
the
organs
and
parts
of
the
lower
animals
from
which
they
have
been
extracted
no
longer
admits
of
doubt
in
cases
of
partial
and
even
complete
impotency
especially
in
elderly
men
attended
with
nervous
exhaustion
most
astonishingly
favorable
results
are
obtained
by
our
specialists
through
the
administration
of
our
extracts
obtained
from
the
nerve
tissue
of
the
spinal
cord
associated
with
the
use
of
the
expressed
juices
from
animal
testes
we
do
not
however
prescribe
these
extracts
to
the
exclusion
of
other
well
tested
remedial
agents
but
do
regard
them
especially
in
the
more
confirmed
and
obstinate
cases
as
among
our
most
positive
curative
agents
illustration
fig
a
small
battery
for
home
use
we
must
confess
that
when
first
proclaimed
by
as
valuable
remedial
agents
we
regarded
the
use
of
these
extracts
with
good
deal
of
skepticism
but
experience
is
after
all
the
best
teacher
and
we
were
forced
after
numerous
successful
tests
to
admit
their
great
efficacy
we
have
always
endeavored
to
keep
up
with
the
vanguard
of
the
army
of
medical
reform
and
so
took
early
occasion
to
introduce
these
agents
into
our
practice
and
made
preparations
to
produce
them
in
our
laboratory
from
an
article
written
by
an
eminent
specialist
in
nervous
diseases
and
recently
published
in
the
new
york
we
extract
the
following
organic
beings
possess
the
power
of
assimilating
from
the
nutritious
matters
they
absorb
the
peculiar
pabulum
which
each
organ
of
the
body
demands
for
the
development
and
sustenance
the
brain
for
instance
selects
that
part
which
it
requires
the
heart
the
material
necessary
for
its
growth
and
preservation
and
so
on
with
the
liver
the
lungs
the
muscles
and
the
various
other
organs
of
the
body
no
mistake
is
ever
committed
the
brain
never
takes
liver
nutriment
nor
the
liver
brain
nutriment
but
each
selects
that
which
it
requires
there
are
however
diseased
conditions
of
the
various
organs
in
which
this
power
is
lost
or
impaired
and
as
a
consequence
disturbance
of
function
or
even
death
itself
is
the
result
now
if
we
can
obtain
the
peculiar
matter
that
an
organ
of
the
body
requires
and
inject
it
directly
into
the
blood
we
do
away
with
the
performance
of
many
vital
processes
which
are
accomplished
only
by
the
expenditure
of
a
large
amount
of
vital
force
let
us
suppose
a
person
suffering
from
an
exhausted
brain
the
result
of
excessive
three
hearty
meals
are
eaten
every
day
but
no
matter
how
judiciously
the
food
may
be
arranged
the
condition
continues
now
if
we
inject
into
that
person
blood
a
concentrated
extract
of
the
brain
of
a
healthy
animal
we
supply
at
once
the
pabulum
which
the
organ
requires
then
if
under
this
treatment
the
morbid
symptoms
disappear
we
are
justified
in
concluding
that
we
have
successfully
aided
nature
in
doing
that
which
unassisted
she
could
not
accomplish
that
is
the
system
i
believe
it
is
applicable
not
only
to
the
brain
but
to
all
the
other
organs
of
the
body
the
writer
of
the
above
is
very
probably
a
little
over
sanguine
in
his
opinion
that
the
plan
of
treatment
will
prove
efficacious
in
all
organic
diseases
but
certainly
from
our
experience
we
can
endorse
his
belief
as
to
its
great
efficacy
in
many
forms
of
organic
weakness
especially
those
of
the
generative
organs
nervous
system
heart
and
some
other
parts
of
the
body
we
believe
that
we
are
placing
a
conservative
estimate
upon
the
remedial
value
of
these
animal
juices
or
extracts
when
we
say
that
they
are
destined
to
fill
an
important
place
in
the
curative
resources
of
the
specialist
in
chronic
diseases
under
the
head
of
epilepsy
also
in
connection
with
our
consideration
of
locomotor
ataxia
we
shall
have
occasion
to
refer
to
the
use
of
these
extracts
as
applicable
to
the
cure
of
those
maladies
most
cases
of
nervous
diseases
that
come
to
us
for
examination
and
treatment
do
so
after
having
tried
without
success
treatment
by
baths
enforced
seclusion
as
well
as
unskillfully
applied
electrical
treatment
and
massage
prolonged
medication
has
frequently
aroused
digestive
disorders
and
made
the
patient
hate
the
sight
of
the
medicine
bottle
in
such
cases
our
improved
methods
as
applied
in
the
institution
and
also
prescribed
for
patients
at
a
distance
enable
our
specialists
to
give
relief
and
effect
cures
with
a
minimum
of
medicine
they
also
enable
us
to
treat
many
cases
of
nervous
diseases
heretofore
regarded
as
almost
hopeless
such
as
locomotor
ataxia
paralysis
epilepsy
and
spinal
affections
with
a
degree
of
success
which
has
been
very
gratifying
alike
to
physicians
and
patients
headache
and
neuralgia
there
is
no
ill
to
which
flesh
is
heir
that
is
the
source
of
a
greater
degree
of
discomfort
to
the
human
race
than
headache
the
farmer
housewife
banker
merchant
and
laborer
seem
to
be
equally
prone
to
the
affliction
and
all
who
suffer
have
a
great
number
of
days
rendered
uncomfortable
and
unhappy
by
the
presence
of
this
most
unpleasant
affection
pain
is
the
warning
finger
of
disease
the
threatening
indication
of
coming
trouble
in
headache
we
have
an
indication
that
the
system
is
subjected
to
some
strain
or
injurious
impression
it
may
be
that
the
eyes
have
been
overworked
or
the
brain
unnaturally
taxed
or
that
the
nervous
and
physical
systems
have
not
been
properly
refreshed
by
sufficient
sleep
and
have
used
up
the
residue
of
reserve
power
many
suffer
from
headache
only
after
they
have
been
subjected
to
sudden
changes
of
temperature
and
have
taken
cold
others
only
when
the
bowels
have
become
inactive
the
liver
torpid
and
the
blood
vitiated
with
retained
poisons
all
appreciate
the
discomfort
that
results
from
this
malady
and
earnestly
seek
for
permanent
relief
headaches
may
be
divided
in
two
classes
those
due
to
the
presence
of
poisons
in
the
blood
and
those
due
to
irritation
of
various
organs
as
of
the
eyes
stomach
liver
and
intestines
of
the
first
form
or
variety
of
headache
influenza
or
grip
and
acute
cold
in
the
head
are
the
most
common
causes
these
give
rise
to
most
excruciating
pain
there
is
congestion
followed
by
inflammation
in
the
nasal
passages
and
cavities
communicating
therewith
the
membranes
of
these
passages
throw
out
a
thin
watery
irritating
discharge
which
gradually
thickens
and
becomes
and
offensive
in
character
if
the
disease
continues
poisonous
matters
are
absorbed
from
the
affected
surfaces
into
the
blood
these
poisons
circulating
in
the
blood
produce
great
irritation
of
the
nerve
cells
so
much
so
that
the
severity
of
the
attack
is
felt
in
the
nervous
centres
the
brain
and
spinal
cord
with
pain
varying
from
the
most
acute
and
sharp
to
a
dull
numb
ache
the
temples
eyes
neck
and
small
of
the
back
are
in
their
order
the
usual
locations
of
greatest
pain
such
attacks
vary
in
frequency
and
severity
one
attack
is
usually
followed
by
an
early
recurrence
which
may
be
more
or
less
severe
while
the
period
of
active
pain
varies
from
a
few
hours
to
several
days
such
attacks
leave
an
exhausted
state
of
the
nerve
centres
and
general
weakness
of
the
system
that
often
lasts
for
weeks
and
may
permanently
impair
the
system
except
such
results
be
prevented
by
appropriate
treatment
every
recurrence
of
the
attack
leaves
the
system
in
a
worse
condition
until
profound
nervous
prostration
ensues
malarial
headache
sometimes
termed
brow
ague
is
a
common
form
of
the
malady
with
those
residing
in
malarial
regions
the
pain
rapidly
develops
usually
over
one
eye
it
lasts
from
five
to
ten
hours
and
is
often
of
frightful
intensity
other
forms
are
rheumatic
and
gouty
headache
usually
a
heavy
aching
pain
appearing
on
the
approach
of
storms
but
at
times
almost
continuous
made
worse
by
improper
diet
uræmic
headache
is
due
to
kidney
disease
and
alcoholic
to
direct
irritation
of
the
brain
membranes
from
the
use
of
alcoholic
beverages
the
latter
is
accompanied
with
much
irritation
of
the
stomach
and
intestines
headaches
of
a
similar
character
result
from
the
presence
in
the
blood
of
an
excess
of
the
active
principles
of
coffee
and
tea
overindulgence
in
these
agents
as
with
alcohol
affects
the
nerve
cells
and
membranes
often
causing
severe
attacks
of
headache
nervous
headache
is
another
common
affliction
this
seems
to
arise
from
several
causes
such
as
impoverished
blood
and
exhaustion
from
overwork
of
the
brain
hysterical
headache
is
not
uncommon
there
is
a
severe
kind
of
headache
the
attacks
of
which
appear
first
at
early
puberty
and
continue
at
intervals
more
or
less
frequent
in
women
up
to
the
change
of
life
and
in
men
to
about
the
fortieth
year
the
periodical
headache
is
usually
preceded
by
yawning
chilliness
languid
exhausted
feelings
in
others
by
peculiar
emotional
or
mental
activity
this
is
followed
by
unusual
drowsiness
in
which
the
rest
is
broken
by
dreams
and
from
which
the
patient
awakes
tired
gradually
during
the
day
the
headache
develops
beginning
in
the
eyes
or
bones
over
them
it
gets
more
and
more
severe
shooting
into
the
jaws
and
neck
or
extending
to
the
back
of
the
head
and
spine
as
the
pains
get
most
severe
nausea
or
vomiting
often
repeated
follow
in
which
the
contents
of
the
stomach
with
mucus
and
bile
is
ejected
the
whole
paroxysm
lasts
from
five
hours
to
two
or
even
three
days
neuralgic
headache
is
a
common
variety
often
the
pain
is
not
confined
to
the
head
in
fact
neuralgia
may
affect
almost
any
part
of
the
system
neuralgia
neuralgia
is
an
affection
of
the
nerves
of
which
the
chief
symptom
is
pain
this
is
of
variable
intensity
and
character
it
follows
the
course
of
the
affected
nerve
and
its
branches
and
occurs
in
paroxysms
of
agonizing
pain
with
periods
of
intermission
during
which
the
pain
may
be
very
slight
and
cause
but
little
discomfort
the
severe
pain
is
described
as
lancinating
cutting
tearing
burning
boring
and
pressing
patients
use
different
words
in
describing
the
attacks
and
there
is
probably
a
difference
in
the
character
of
the
pain
though
in
a
severe
paroxysm
one
is
scarcely
able
to
make
a
very
nice
distinction
we
have
known
cases
in
which
the
pain
occurred
suddenly
and
overwhelmed
the
patient
fortitude
by
its
severity
and
unexpected
onset
between
the
paroxysms
there
may
be
less
severe
pain
which
is
then
more
frequently
of
an
aching
burning
or
pricking
character
in
some
paroxysm
after
paroxysm
succeed
each
other
with
almost
rapidity
and
even
in
the
intervals
the
pain
is
very
intense
at
another
time
there
is
only
one
sharp
sting
of
pain
which
attacks
recur
several
times
an
hour
or
day
or
may
be
absent
for
days
or
months
an
extended
freedom
from
all
pain
is
rare
in
a
patient
very
much
affected
the
first
attacks
in
all
forms
of
neuralgia
are
often
comparatively
light
and
the
severity
of
the
pain
gradually
increases
as
the
attacks
multiply
we
have
frequently
had
patients
unacquainted
with
anatomy
map
out
the
distribution
of
a
nerve
very
perfectly
simply
describing
the
portion
of
the
body
in
which
the
pain
was
experienced
for
convenience
the
neuralgia
has
been
named
with
reference
to
the
nerve
most
seriously
attacked
lumbago
to
the
spasms
of
pain
affecting
the
small
of
the
back
is
a
term
applied
to
neuralgia
of
the
fifth
nerve
that
supplying
the
side
of
the
face
with
branches
to
the
eyes
jaw
and
teeth
neuralgia
of
the
testicles
ovaries
stomach
heart
are
frequently
met
with
that
affecting
the
large
nerve
supplying
the
thigh
and
leg
is
termed
sciatica
these
nerve
affections
often
prove
a
most
grave
disorder
rendering
the
life
of
the
sufferer
a
burden
treatment
contrary
to
opinions
frequently
expressed
by
members
of
the
medical
profession
we
find
that
most
cases
present
some
removable
or
remediable
cause
for
attacks
of
headache
and
neuralgia
the
temporary
relief
that
is
obtained
by
the
use
of
headache
powders
various
bromide
combinations
caffeine
and
other
anodyne
and
narcotic
medicines
is
sometimes
necessary
in
order
that
the
excruciating
sufferings
may
be
borne
for
the
time
but
as
a
rule
such
remedies
only
react
unfavorably
by
interfering
still
further
with
the
natural
restoration
of
the
affected
organs
or
protract
the
removal
of
the
cause
of
the
disease
hence
the
next
attack
is
usually
earlier
in
its
appearance
and
more
severe
and
lasting
when
such
agents
are
employed
the
great
majority
of
headaches
and
neuralgias
are
due
to
the
presence
of
poisons
in
the
blood
this
may
be
due
to
affections
of
the
or
organs
for
the
correction
of
inactive
glands
or
a
lack
of
purification
of
the
blood
due
to
such
cause
the
use
of
golden
medical
discovery
is
particularly
beneficial
it
has
no
equal
in
its
direct
effect
upon
the
liver
the
great
purifying
organ
of
the
body
through
this
natural
gateway
it
removes
from
the
system
poisonous
materials
which
are
the
waste
from
the
nerve
cells
the
accumulation
of
these
waste
materials
irritates
the
cells
and
causes
them
to
cry
out
with
pain
the
blood
being
properly
purified
by
the
use
of
golden
medical
discovery
supplies
to
the
nerves
and
to
the
nerve
cells
what
they
crave
a
healthy
and
rich
blood
that
furnishes
proper
nourishment
hence
the
headache
disappears
and
the
neuralgic
pains
are
overcome
when
the
liver
is
engorged
and
torpid
the
intestines
become
overloaded
with
fecal
matters
that
putrefy
and
give
rise
to
gases
and
consequent
distention
deleterious
poisons
are
formed
and
absorbed
by
the
blood
from
such
hardened
and
irritating
lumps
in
the
intestines
when
the
bowels
are
thus
constipated
pierce
pleasant
pellets
are
necessary
as
an
adjunct
to
the
golden
medical
discovery
the
pellets
remove
from
the
intestinal
canal
all
irritating
materials
and
thus
enhance
the
alterative
or
action
of
the
golden
medical
discovery
in
women
when
there
is
a
nervous
affection
dependent
upon
some
unnatural
state
of
the
ovaries
or
uterus
and
complicated
with
an
imperfect
or
unnatural
circulation
in
those
parts
we
have
noted
that
most
satisfactory
results
invariably
follow
the
use
of
favorite
prescription
this
agent
improves
the
tone
of
the
nervous
system
and
by
its
direct
restorative
tonic
effects
lessens
or
overcomes
any
congestion
of
the
womb
or
its
appendages
regulates
menstruation
and
promotes
a
condition
of
health
and
vigor
in
a
vast
experience
our
specialists
have
thoroughly
tested
a
great
many
specific
remedies
which
we
prescribe
for
sending
the
necessary
remedies
to
our
patients
by
express
or
mail
carefully
adapting
them
to
each
individual
case
many
sufferers
have
been
by
a
brief
course
of
our
relieved
permanently
from
excruciating
sufferings
that
had
been
a
source
of
annoyance
and
loss
of
time
for
many
years
prior
to
the
use
of
our
remedies
our
treatment
is
intended
to
effect
permanent
cures
we
do
not
use
those
narcotics
and
compounds
of
antipyrine
and
other
similar
agents
which
are
very
depressing
in
their
effects
and
like
morphine
and
other
preparations
of
opium
give
only
temporary
relief
and
interfere
with
the
action
of
the
heart
but
we
use
treatment
that
builds
up
the
system
removes
the
cause
of
the
difficulty
and
restores
the
nervous
system
and
all
the
organs
of
the
body
to
a
normal
and
healthful
condition
in
some
cases
we
advise
treatment
in
our
institution
where
we
have
every
facility
in
the
way
of
electrical
appliances
and
many
other
aids
that
can
only
be
employed
by
the
personal
attention
of
a
skillful
physician
these
aids
are
more
fully
described
under
the
head
of
nervous
exhaustion
and
a
reference
is
also
suggested
to
what
we
have
to
say
under
the
heads
of
paralysis
and
locomotor
ataxia
headaches
or
neuralgic
pains
due
to
local
irritations
as
uterine
disease
stricture
neurotic

neuralgia
one
of
the
most

forms
of
nerve
irritation
is
particularly
amenable
to
treatment
by
the
modern
means
of
cure
used
in
our
practice
at
the
invalids
hotel
we
find
as
a
rule
that
severe
headaches
and
neuralgias
are
but
the
forerunners
of
more
serious
conditions
and
are
therefore
deserving
of
special
attention
they
should
be
corrected
as
early
as
possible
before
any
organic
changes
have
occurred
paralysis
or

locomotor
ataxia
and
kindred
affections
paralysis
is
an
affection
characterized
by
loss
of
muscular
power
or
by
the
sense
of
touch
taste
sight
or
smell
becoming
impaired
from
injury
to
a
nerve
by
accident
or
disease
the
disease
is
sometimes
due
to
simple
lack
of
nerve
force
or
power
this
may
come
from
interference
with
the
blood
supply
of
the
nerve
centres
as
in
hysterical
palsy
and
reflex
paralysis
frequently
the
power
of
speech
is
affected
in
this
way
ability
to
remember
and
difficulty
in
pronunciation
of

the
causes
of
paralysis
are
very
numerous
whatever
destroys
or
impairs
the
natural
structure
of
nervous
matter
or
whatever
interferes
materially
with
the
conducting
power
of
or
the
generating
power
of
the
will
produce
a
paralysis
the
extent
of
which
will
depend
upon
the
amount
of
nervous
matter
affected
thus
paralysis
may
be
due
to
disease
of
the
brain
arising
from
apoplexy
to
abscess
softening
syphilitic
or
other
tumors
or
epilepsy
to
disease
of
the
spinal
cord
or
marrow
to
disease
of
the
structures
which
surround
the
spinal
cord
producing
pressure
upon
it
to
injury
or
compression
of
a
nerve
by
which
its
conducting
power
it
impaired
to
the
effects
of
diphtheria
hysteria
or
rheumatism
it
may
also
be
due
to
poisoning
of
nervous
matter
with
opium
lead
arsenic
or
mercury
or
to
the
retention
of
poisonous
substances
which
are
generated
in
the
living
body
and
which
should
pass
off
through
the
excretory
organs
as
the
elements
of
the
urine
and
bile
members
of
consumptive
families
are
very
prone
to
paralysis
we
also
find
that
the
disease
is
often
the
result
of
some
nervous
strain
or
over
excitement
the
over
indulgence
of
the
passions
is
particularly
a
fruitful
source
of
injury
to
the
brain
and
spinal
centres
an
angry
man
or
woman
uses
up
more
nerve
energy
in
a
few
minutes
than
would
be
sufficient
to
serve
the
muscles
with
stimulus
through
hours
of
toil
the
young
in
unnatural
indulgence
of
the
sexual
passions
waste
the
vigor
and
energy
of
maturity
sexual
excesses
must
be
put
down
as
among
the
most
prolific
causes
of
this
terrible
malady
ignorance
shields
no
one
from
the
consequences
of
violations
of
the
laws
of
health
the
passion
for
wealth
with
its
ceaseless
toil
continuous
strain
and
rapid
exhaustion
of
the
nerve
forces
usually
brings
its
devotee
into
the
same
condition
of
discord
as
does
the
abuse
of
a
stimulant
for
a
time
the
system
will
repair
and
bolster
up
the
weakness
but
the
longer
the
day
of
reckoning
is
postponed
the
more
serious
and
terrible
is
the
collapse
such
individuals
need
only
an
exposure
to
cold
or
an
over
indulgence
of
some
kind
to
suddenly
precipitate
a
paralysis
general
paralysis
this
term
is
applied
to
paralysis
affecting
the
arms
and
legs
in
this
form
of
paralysis
there
is
generally
more
loss
of
motion
than
of
sensation
and
the
mind
is
usually
more
or
less
affected
hemiplegia
or
paralysis
of
one
side
of
the
body
is
generally
spoken
of
as
a
stroke
of
palsy
sometimes
only
one
extremity
the
arm
is
affected
only
occasionally
is
the
face
involved
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
mind
is
affected
the
memory
being
poor
the
sufferer
becoming
melancholy
peevish
and
fretful
in
paralysis
of
the
right
side
there
is
sometimes
a
curious
forgetfulness
or
misplacement
of
language
the
patient
being
unable
to
think
of
words
to
express
his
thoughts
this
condition
is
called
it
is
usually
the
result
of
some
injury
or
disease
of
the
brain
almost
invariably
the
side
of
the
brain
opposite
the
affected
half
of
the
body
in
some
cases
it
is
due
to
a
wasting
or
softening
of
the
brain
substance
on
account
of
insufficient
nourishment
a
deficient
supply
of
blood
whilst
in
others
it
is
due
to
just
the
opposite
condition
an
excess
of
blood
producing
rupture
of
some
transudations
and
pressure
paraplegia
or
paralysis
of
the
lower
half
of
the
body
is
the
result
of
disease
of
the
spinal
marrow
the
paralysis
may
occur
suddenly
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
it
comes
on
slowly
and
insidiously
with
weakness
and
numbness
of
the
feet
and
legs
or
with
tingling
and
a
sensation
resembling
that
produced
by
ants
creeping
on
the
surface
of
the
skin
by
degrees
the
weakness
increases
until
there
is
complete
loss
of
both
motion
and
sensation
in
the
feet
and
legs
the
lower
bowel
and
bladder
are
generally
involved
and
as
a
result
the
patient
suffers
from
constipation
and
retention
and
dribbling
of
urine
although
completely
paralyzed
the
patient
is
often
tormented
with
involuntary
movements
and
cramps
in
the
affected
muscles
paraplegia
may
be
caused
by
various
injuries
of
the
spinal
cord
by
congestion
degeneration
or
hemorrhage
by
pressure
from
thickening
of
the
sheath
of
the
cord
or
from
tumors
or
from
disease
of
the
bones
and
cartilages
of
the
spinal
column
paraplegia
may
also
be
produced
through
reflex
action
by
an
irritation
or
injury
to
some
organ
or
part
of
the
body
distant
from
the
spinal
cord
thus
irritation
of
the
skin
or
of
the
bowels
from
the
presence
of
worms
or
disease
of
the
bladder
or
of
the
womb
may
produce
paraplegia
locomotor
ataxia
locomotor
ataxia
or
creeping
palsy
is
also
called
progressive
paralysis
this
affection
consists
of
a
disease
of
the
nervous
matter
in
the
posterior
columns
of
the
spinal
cord
it
usually
affects
first
the
lower
part
of
the
cord
and
those
portions
of
the
nerve
matter
that
supply
the
muscles
of
the
legs
in
other
cases
it
first
affects
the
portions
of
the
spinal
cord
that
supply
the
arms
in
most
cases
of
this
disease
there
is
an
early
stage
in
which
the
patient
suffers
from
lightning
pains
as
they
are
called
these
are
of
a
severe
stabbing
boring
character
very
sudden
in
their
onset
and
at
times
so
serious
as
to
have
induced
suicide
these
paroxysms
in
the
milder
form
of
the
disease
are
not
so
severe
and
are
readily
controlled
by
anodynes
they
may
affect
the
stomach
and
be
mistaken
for
dyspepsia
or
the
rectum
and
be
taken
for
fissure
or
piles
at
times
they
affect
the
bladder
when
the
symptoms
are
not
unlike
those
of
stone
or
cancer
in
many
cases
we
find
the
patient
has
been
treated
for
a
long
period
of
years
for
rheumatism
sciatica
or
neuralgia
when
the
real
disease
has
been
this
progressive
paralysis
in
its
earlier
stage
sometimes
the
disease
takes
the
form
of
spermatorrhea
or
impotency
in
other
cases
it
is
manifested
in
weak
eyes
disturbances
of
vision
or
sooner
or
later
there
appears
the
peculiar
paralysis
of
the
disease
which
consists
of
more
or
less
numbness
of
the
feet
and
legs
and
in
the
later
stages
of
the
hands
and
arms
sometimes
of
the
face
as
a
rule
however
the
patient
finds
difficulty
in
properly
maintaining
his
balance
and
in
walking
his
movements
are
tottering
like
a
man
partially
intoxicated
it
is
difficult
for
him
to
maintain
his
balance
and
walk
with
his
eyes
closed
if
the
arms
are
affected
their
movements
are
uncertain
in
guiding
a
needle
or
in
buttoning
or
unbuttoning
the
clothing
there
is
an
inability
to
move
the
hand
with
rapidity
and
certainty
or
to
any
portion
of
the
face
or
body
if
the
eyes
be
closed
the
eyes
and
attention
must
be
constantly
directed
to
the
motion
that
is
about
to
be
performed
or
it
is
imperfectly
done
the
brain
centres
in
this
case
supply
the
weakened
action
of
the
spinal
cord
and
the
stimulus
to
the
muscles
is
directed
by
the
intelligence
instead
of
being
automatic
as
in
health
and
due
to
spinal
action
still
later
the
voluntary
movements
become
spasmodic
or
jerking
the
neuralgic
pains
often
become
very
distressing
there
is
often
a
sense
of
constriction
around
the
limbs
or
body
as
if
they
were
encircled
with
tight
cords
in
extreme
cases
locomotion
becomes
impossible
the
patient
is
unable
to
bring
the
hand
to
the
mouth
and
the
speech
may
become
impaired
articulation
being
difficult
and
imperfect
in
all
cases
there
is
more
or
less
loss
of
sensation
in
the
lower
limbs
the
patient
generally
being
usable
to
distinguish
between
two
points
and
one
even
when
the
two
are
a
considerable
distance
apart
the
inability
to
feel
the
contact
of
the
ground
or
floor
with
the
feet
occasions
the
difficulty
in
walking
the
causes
of
this
disease
are
somewhat
obscure
but
unquestionably
exposure
to
cold
and
dampness
and
work
are
largely
instrumental
in
its
production
scrofula
and
syphilis
favor
its
development
while
abuse
of
the
nervous
system
such
as
results
from
of
the
animal
and
reproductive
instincts
are
frequent
sources
of
the
nervous
changes
that
lead
to
ataxia
shaking
palsy
palsy
or
paralysis
is
an
affection
dependent
upon
degenerative
changes
in
the
nervous
centres
it
is
characterized
by
a
tremulous
agitation
or
continual
shaking
beginning
in
the
hands
arms
or
head
and
gradually
extending
itself
over
the
entire
body
the
disease
progresses
slowly
but
when
far
advanced
the
agitation
is
violent
and
the
patient
swallows
and
masticates
his
food
with
great
difficulty
in
an
advanced
stage
of
the
disease
the
body
becomes
bent
forward
and
the
chin
almost
touches
the
the
tremor
which
early
in
the
disease
only
occurred
during
the
time
the
patient
was
awake
now
continues
during

and
not
infrequently
the
agitation
becomes
so
violent
as
to
waken

the
indications
of
treatment
for
the
various
forms
of
paralysis
are
to
remove
the
causes
if
these
can
be
determined
and
rouse
the
functions
of
the
paralyzed
parts
measures
should
be
adopted
to
remedy
the
morbid
conditions
upon
which
this

depends
keep
the
skin
clean
and
healthy
promote
the
circulation
of
the
blood
especially
in
the
paralyzed
limbs
and
encourage
healthy
nutrition
these
ends
may
be
best
attained
by
the
daily
employment
of
stimulating
baths
and
frictions
upon
the
surface
as
much
regular
exercise
as
the
patient
can
bear
without
fatigue
should
be
taken
in
order
to
favor
the
preservation
of
the
appetite

strength
care
should
also
be
taken
that
the
bowels
are
evacuated
regularly
every
day
the
circulation
through
and
consequently
the
nutrition
of
the
palsied
muscles
may
be
aided
by
having
a
strong
healthy
person
knead
and
manipulate
them
these
manual
movements
upon
the
surface
of
the
body
will
often
excite
muscular
sensibility
similar
to
that
awakened
by
a
weak
faradic
current
the
internal
medicines
should
be
such
as
to
regulate
the
general
functions
of

the
use
of
these
remedies
must
be
directed
by
the
skill
and
experience
of

when
the

has
been
able

we
have
found
the
employment

applied

they
compress

and
thus
force
the

there
is
a
constant
pressure
in

hence
the
flow
of
blood
in

is
always
towards
the
veins
and
when
it
gets
into

it
is
prevented
from
flowing
back
by
the

in

a
proper

is
thus
effected
and
as
the
result
they
receive
an

are
promptly
carried
away
to

by

observation
that
there

in
the

subjected
to
this
action
which
be
due
mainly
to
an
increase
in
the
changes
that
are
superinduced
by
the
nutritious
elements

increased
the
amount
of
carbonic

gas
exhaled
is
increased
and
further
evidence
in
the

direction
is
furnished
by
the
very

increase

illustration

the

in

thus
this

epilepsy
or
falling
sickness
is
a
disease
which
is
characterized
by
attacks
of
sudden
loss
of
consciousness
together
with
convulsive
movements
of
the
muscles
the
paroxysms
occur
at
irregular
intervals
the
periods
between
them
in
some
cases
being
only
a
few
minutes
or
hours
while
in
others
several
months
elapse
there
are
two
classes
of
epilepsy
the
general
form
with
a
convulsion
that
usually
involves
all
the
muscles
of
the
body
simultaneously
it
begins
suddenly
with
little
or
no
warning
commonly
with
a
cry
or
scream
the
convulsion
may
last
several
minutes
and
is
followed
by
a
deep
sleep
for
some
hours
the
local
or
jacksonian
form
in
which
the
attack
begins
with
a
peculiar
sensation
in
some
particular
region
of
the
body
either
in
one
extremity
or
one
half
of
the
face
this
sensation
is
followed
by

parts
consciousness
is
not
usually
lost

it
may
be
when
the
spasms
culminate
in

generally
follows
in

is
sometimes
caught

paroxysm
the
countenance
changes
from
a
livid
hue
to

purple
the
convulsion
continues
from
one
to
three
minutes
and
is
followed
by
a
deep
sighing
inspiration
the
subject
then
sinks
into
a
deep
sleep
which
continues
for
half
an
hour
or
longer
when
consciousness
is
first
regained
the
subject
appears
confused
stupid
and
usually
complains
of
headache
he
has
no
recollection
of
what
has
occurred
during
the
attack
he
pronounces
words
indistinctly
and
if
he
attempts
to
walk
he
staggers
like
a
drunken
man
sometimes
several
attacks
occur
so
closely
together
that
there
is
no
interval
of
consciousness
between
them
in
some
cases
there
are
premonitory
symptoms
such
as
giddiness
drowsiness

the

this

requires
the
personal
attention
of
a
physician
skilled
in

employment
it
is
also
of
first
importance
that
the
extracts
be

we
have

exert

into

in
this

surgical
treatment
a
considerable
proportion
of
those
cases
of
epilepsy
termed
jacksonian
have
been
found
to
be
caused
by
new
growth
upon
or
in
the
substance
of
the
brain
sometimes
cysts
form
as
a
result
of
small
hemorrhages
or
of
spots
of
softening
from
clots
in
the
cerebral
arteries
other
cases
are
due
to
a
small
spot
of
hardened
tissue
or
an
inflamed
centre
of
irritation
in
the
outer
gray
matter
of
the
brain
the
majority
of
these
forms
of
disease
can
be
exactly
localized
in
a
small
area
of
the
brain
and
may
usually
be
traced
to
a
blow
or
fall
on
the
head
or
to
fracture
of
the
skull
without
depression
the
discovery
of
the
fact
that
such
results
of
injury
will
produce
localized
spasm
has
naturally
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
similar
products
anywhere
in
the
brain
may
give
rise
to
epilepsy
in
these
cases
trephining
of
the
skull
and
the
removal
of
irritation
from
the
brain
has
been
followed
by
the
most
successful
results
it
is
seldom
a
serious
or
dangerous
operation
but
very
few
deaths
having
resulted
in
the
practice
of
good
surgeons
in
many
hundreds
of
cases
and
these
were
individuals
who
were
not
favorable
for
operation
and
in
whom
it
was
undertaken
as
a
last
resort
in
these
cases
of
epilepsy
due
to
injury
the
operation
is
fairly
safe
and
in
carefully
selected
cases
that
have
not
been
allowed
to
run
so
long
as
to
bring
upon
the
brain
a
general
epileptic
tendency
the
results
of

are

is
an
affection
of
the
nervous
system
which
is
characterized
by
spasmodic
contractions

muscles
it
may
affect
the
entire

it
is
usually
confined
to
the

side
or
to
a
special
group
of
muscles
symptoms
twitchings
of
the
muscles
of
the
face
are
the
most
conspicuous
symptoms
they
are
at
first
comparatively
slight
but
as
the
disease
progresses
these
spasms
become
more
decided
and
the
face
is
twisted
into
various
shapes
and
forms
the
head
in
some
cases
is
constantly
jerking
it
is
with
great
difficulty
that
the
tongue
is
thrust
out
of
the
mouth
and
then
with
a
sudden
jerk
it
is
quickly
withdrawn
these
spasms
or
contortions
may
affect
the
extremities
in
a
similar
manner
the
hands
and
arms
can
not
be
kept
quiet
the
gait
may
be
unsteady
and
one
foot
is
merely
dragged
after
the
other
if
one
limb
be
forcibly
held
to
keep
it
quiet
some
other
limb
will
involuntarily
move
strange
as
it
may
appear
these
contractions
which
can
not
be
controlled
by
the
will
during
wakefulness
are
very
much
lessened
or
arrested
by
sleep
prior
to
the
development
of
the
spasmodic
affection
there
is
usually
a
period
in
which
the
sufferer
notes
a
want
of
appetite
languidness
with
disinclination
towards
mental
or
bodily
pursuits
headache
restlessness
pains
in
the
limbs
and

with
irritable
temper
and
weakness
of
memory
there
are
many
other
symptoms
in
special
cases
as
the
disease
develops
the
patient
gradually
begins
to
exhibit
an
awkwardness
of
movement
in
the
extremities
and
objects
frequently
fall
from
the
grasp
children
thus
afflicted
spill

such
children
are
very
often
punished
for

habits
later
on
the
symptoms
become
more
unmistakable
and
the
presence
of
the
disease
is
readily
recognized

may
become
incapable

is
one
in
which
there
is

complicated
with

and

there
is
no
affection
more
amenable

in

early
stages
than
this
we
are
daily
in
receipt
of
correspondence
from
sufferers
or
their
parents
or
friends
in
which
the
most
gratifying
relief
and
a
cure
has
resulted
from
the
use
of
pierce
favorite
prescription
used
in
conjunction
with
pierce
golden
medical
discovery
these
two
remedies
should
be
used
alternately
the
dose
being
suited
to
the
age
of
the
patient
a
large
majority
of
the
cases
of
chorea
occur
in
females
and
at
the
period
of
life
when
the
nervous
system
is
subjected
to
unusual
requirements
in
these
cases
the
favorite
prescription
effects
a
gradual
restoration
of
nervous
energy
and
improvement
in
the
tone
of
the
nerve
centres
and
by
its
direct
effect
upon
the
circulation
in
the
ovarian
region
eliminates
the
most
potent
causes
of
debility
in
young
people
we
usually
advise
a
dose
of
three
drops
for
each
year
of
the
age
for
instance
children
of
eight
years
of
age
should
take
drops
those
of
twelve
drops
those
of
fifteen
drops
which
is
about
of
a
teaspoonful
a
similar
dose
of
pierce
golden
medical
discovery
should
be
administered
taking
it
before
meals
and
the
prescription
after
meals
under
their
administration
the
patient
will
rapidly
improve
in
health
and
strength
the
circulation
is
materially
bettered
the
blood
is
purified
enriched
vitalized
the
remedies
effect
a
complete
removal
from
the
blood
of
the
impurities
that
represent
nerve
waste
and
as
a
consequence
the
nerve
cells
are
properly
nourished
the
disease
is
gradually
controlled
and
when
the
favorable
influences
of
quiet
nourishing
food
with
plenty
of
outdoor
air
and
not
too
active
exercise
is
added
the
progress
is
most
gratifying
the
patients
in
a
few
weeks
are
able
to
control
much
of
the
spasmodic
movements
and
gradually
their
restoration
to
a
normal
condition
is
accomplished
in
occasional
cases
where
there
is
some
complication
as
rheumatism
or
other
severe
affection
complicating
and
preventing
their
recovery
special
treatment
is

to

this

third
month

you
sent
without

a

two

about

i
had
tried
all

in

with
no
satisfactory
benefit
they
did
not
understand
my
case
i
was
a
nervous

unable
to
sleep
could
not
eat
and
underwent
the
usual
horrors
that
one
endures
where
there
is
loss
of
control
of
the
nerves
a
few
months
more
would
have
made
me
insane
my
cure
has
remained
permanent
the
relief
was
something
that
i
can
not
describe
it
has
enabled
me
to
pursue
my

steadily
ever

away

often

over
a
year
now
since
i
applied
to
you
for
help
and
it
is
more
than
six
months
since
i
reported
myself
as
well
i
have
worked
very
hard
since
then
and
still
have
continued
well
all
the
time
when
i
called
upon
you
for
treatment
i
was
in
a
terrible
condition
i
was
subject
to
severe
headaches
was
troubled
with
a
tired
an
almost
lifeless
feeling
and
although
i
slept
could
not
get
i
was
nervous
and
fretful
and
could
not
do
as
much
work
as
i
wanted
to
do
to
tell
it
all
in
a
few
words
was
all
run
i
had
never
wholly
recovered
from
the
grip
which
left
me
in
a
very
poor
condition
and
that
together
with
and
insufficient
physical
exercise
had
put
me
in
such
a
condition
that
i
was
almost
unfit
to
teach
my
school
after
five
months
treatment
one
month
intervening
in
which
i
received
none
i
considered
myself
well
and
i
think
that
i
was
right
i
feel
very
grateful
to
you
for
your
treatment
of
me
and
shall
ever
be
willing
to
speak
a
good
word
for
you

about
eighteen
years

after
the
birth
of
one
of
my
children
i
was
left
in
a
weak
condition
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
nerves
were
unstrung
very
bad
i
did
not
suffer
much
pain
but
i
think
i
suffered
everything
any
one
could
suffer
with
nervousness
my
life
was
a
misery
to
me
i
doctored
with
seven
different
doctors
and
got
no
relief
then
i
took
almost
all
kinds
of
patent
medicines
and
got
no
relief
from
them
but
got
worse
all
the
time
when
i
chanced
to
get
one
of
your
little
pamphlets
i
thought
i
would
write
to
you
and
waited
as
i
thought
to
hear
that
there
was
no
help
for
me
when
my
answer
came
and
you
said
you
could
cure
me
great
was
my
joy
i
had
taken
your
medicine
about
a
month
when
i
began
to
improve
and
in
a
few
months
was
entirely
cured
my
recovery
was
like
coming
out
of
the
dark
into

so
great
was
the
change
i
will
advise
all
sufferers
to
go
to
you

i

they
will
be
disappointed

i
now

stand
a
sudden
rush
of
horses
feet

a
quick
halloo
from

did
not
come
back
my

doctor

two

did
me
no

late
in

i
got
a

quieted

up

was

i

any

expected
me
to
get
well
i
took
the
treatment
sent
me

the
medicine
never
gave
me

the
change
from
one
extreme

was
like

six

i
had
an
attack
of

which
left
my
health
in

precarious
condition
i
was
placed
under
the
treatment
of
a
good
physician
who
did
all
in
his
power
to
restore
my
health
but
all
in
vain
i
had
dyspepsia
and
could
not
eat
meat
vegetables
nor
fruit
of
any
kind
i
suffered
alternately
from
cold
and
heat
at
times
my
feet
and
knees
would
feel
like
ice
to
the
touch
and
at
other
times
i
would
suffer
the
most
excruciating
torture
seeming
as
though
every
nerve
in
my
body
was
being
seared
with
a
hot
iron
my
left
hip
and
knee
would
become
so
affected
that
i
could
scarcely
walk
across
the
room
i
slept
very
little
on
one
occasion
i
remained
awake
four
days
and
four
nights
and
then
was
put
to
sleep
by
repeated
doses
of
morphine
my
nervous
system
became
so
shattered
that
words
spoken
by
any
person
in
my
room
fell
like
pebbles
on
my
brain
and
nights
i
would
often
have
to
be
raised
in
bed
to
prevent
smothering
to
death
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
describe
my
sufferings
at
that
time
but
i
know
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
pierce
favorite
prescription
i
would
have
been
in
my
grave
i
began
the
use
of
the
favorite
prescription
in
march
three
years
ago
as
well
as
i
can
remember
continued
till
summer
when
i
wrote
to
you
received
your
advice
and
a
few
simple
prescriptions
which
i
had
filled
at
the
drug
store
i
also
began
the
use
of
the
golden
medical
discovery
my
nerves
became
quiet
i
slept
well
my
stomach
began
to
heal
my
strength
returned
and
i
began
to
feel
like
a

person
and
while
i
am
not
as
strong
as

can

may

that
was

disease

inherited
from

she
had
spasms

fits
once
in

three
days
and
grew
worse
so
rapidly
that
in
four
months
she
had
from
four
to
eight
fits
in

home
physicians
did
no
good
and
just
then
one
of
your
little
pamphlets
came
to
me
as
they
had
come
often
before
as
my
need
was
great
i
wrote
a
description
of
her
case
and
though
your
answer
did
not
seem
very
encouraging
i
did
not
dare
to
lose
any
chance
of
saving
my
child
so
i
commenced
the
treatment
on
november
she
had
seven
fits
november
gave
her
your
medicines
she
had
four
fits
that
day
and
never
one
since
she
took
your
medicines
less
than
four
months
she
is
nearly
six
years
old
a
strong
hearty
bright
child
attending
school
every
day
what
more
can
i
say
than
that
i
thank

the

for
having
saved
the

now
people
are

find

both

criminal
abortion

concerning

true
there
may

circumstances
in

it
is

as

so
deformed

all
the
circumstances

relating
to
the
case

can
summon

we
wish
to
have
it
distinctly

that
we
will
not
under

circumstances
prescribe
medicines

perform
any
operation
to
relieve
women
of

mechanical
means
are
resorted
to
by
abortionists
and
many
women
produce
abortion
upon
themselves
it
always
terminates
in
lasting
injury
and
sometimes
in
speedy
death
certain
medicines
will
sometimes
produce
abortion
but
they
are
very
unsafe
an
opinion
is
very
prevalent
that
if
abortion
be
produced
before
the
movements
of

there
is
no
crime
committed
it
should
be

that

with

at

is
committed

whoever
disobeys

sick
headaches
and
various
aches
and
pains
as
if
they
were
diseases
when
in
reality
they
are
only
so
many
local
manifestations
or
of
some
overlooked
derangement
or
disease
of
the
womb
for
as
we
have
already
intimated
every
organ
of
the
system
is
in
sympathy
with
the
uterus
or
womb
any
disease
either
functional
or
organic
of
this
organ
is
at
once
manifest
through
several
if
not
all
the
sympathizing
organs
of
the
system
when
we
receive
a
sharp
blow
upon
the
elbow
the
pain
is
felt
most
keenly
in
our
little
finger
just
so
in
diseases
of
the
womb
often
the
most
distress
is
felt
in
organs
or
parts
of
the
system
quite
distant
from
the
real
seat
of
disease
on
this
account
thoughtless
and
ignorant
physicians
are
misled
and
very
commonly
mistake
the
invalid
disease
for
some
affection
of
the
stomach
heart
liver
kidneys
or
other
organ
when
really
it
is
located
in
the
uterus
cure
the
disease
of
the
womb
and
all
these
disagreeable
manifestations
or
symptoms
vanish
their
cause
being
removed
the
various
dependent
derangements
and
disagreeable
nervous
sensations
and
sufferings
rapidly
give
way
and
vigorous
health
is
firmly
time
and
perseverance
in
treatment
required
to
cure
most
chronic
diseases
of
women
are
slow
in
their
inception
or
development
and
their
removal
or
cure
must
necessarily
be
gradual
disease
that
has
been
progressing
and
becoming
more
firmly
established
for
months
or
perhaps
years
can
not
except
in
rare
cases
be
hastily
dislodged
and
the
system
restored
to
perfect
health
the
process
of
cure
like
the
development
and
progress
of
the
disease
must
be
a
gradual
one
accomplished
step
by
step
often
too
the
use
of
medicines
that
if
in
will
prove
beneficial
and
curative
will
for
a
considerable
time
arouse
in
the
system
very
disagreeable
sensations
and
many
times
this
leads
unthinking
persons
to
become
frightened
or
discouraged
and
to
quit
the
treatment
best
adapted
to
their
cases
if
only
faithfully
carried
out
in
many
forms
of
womb
disease
their
are
organic
lesions
or
changes
that
can
be
repaired
only
by
a
gradual
process
just
as
an
external
wound
would
heal
not
suddenly
but
by
a
constant
slow
filling
in
and
building
up
or
by
the
gradual
development
or
growth
of
one
cell
upon
another
just
as
a
great
breach
in
a
wall
would
be
repaired
by
filling
in
brick
upon
brick
until
the
defect
is
effaced
so
must
these
lesion
be
removed
by
gradual
processes
when
fully
repaired
the
dependent
sympathetic
derangements
disagreeable
sensations
and
all
the
long
train
of
consequential
symptoms
are
one
by
one
abolished
not
limited
in
our
remedial
resources
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
while
we
recommend
in
this
little
volume
certain
courses
of
treatment
for
ordinary
cases
the
remedies
mentioned
do
not
by
any
means
embrace
all
our
resources
in
the
way
of
medicines
and
other
curative
agencies
especially
for
complicated
difficult
or
very
obstinate
cases
in
many
of
the
latter
class
we
can
send
medicines
that
are
exactly
adapted
to
the
case
if
the
invalid
will
fill
out
one
of
our
applications
for
treatment
which
may
be
found
folded
in
the
latter
part
of
this
book
or
which
will
be
sent
to
any
address
on
application
by
mail
in
most
womb
diseases
the
chemical
and
microscopical
examination
of
the
urine
also
furnishes
valuable
aid
in
determining
the
exact
condition
of
the
patient
as
well
as
the
precise
stage
of
the
local

may
be
found
in
the
appendix
of
this
little
volume
every
case
submitted
to
us
either
by

or
in

receives
the
careful
and
deliberate
consideration
of
a
full

of
specialists
before
a

menstruation
and
its
disorders
the
function
of
the
ovaries
is
to
furnish
ova
or
germs
and
the
functions
of
the
uterus
or
womb
are
to
secrete

to
exude
the
menses
to
secrete
the
decidua

makes
its

in
the
female
between
the
twelfth
and
fifteenth
years
at
which
time
the
reproductive
system
undergoes
remarkable
changes
a
marked
characteristic
of
menstruation
is
its
regular
return
about
every
days
the
menstrual
flow
usually
continues
from
three
to
six
days
and
the
discharge
seems
to
be
ordinary
blood
which
during
its
vaginal
passage
becomes
mixed
with
mucus
and
is
thereby
deprived
of
the
power
of
coagulation
the
quantity
exuded
varies
from
two
to
eight
ounces
but
the
amount
consistent
with
the
health
of
one
person
may
be
excessive
and
weakening
in
another
this
function
is
regarded
as
being
regular
when
its
effect
upon
the
system
is
favorable
for
whatever
organic
process
directly
contributes
to
the
health
should
be
considered
as
normal
it
occurs
at
regular
intervals
for
about
thirty
years
when
menstruation
and
the
aptitude
for
conception
simultaneously
cease
the
departures
from
healthy
menstruation
are
numerous
the
most
important
of
these
are
and
amenorrhea
the
term
signifies
the
absence
of
menstruation
when
it
should
occur
it
may
be
considered
under
two
general
heads
when
it
fails
to
be
established
at
the
proper
age
and
when
after
having
made
its
appearance
it
ceases
to
return
at
the
usual
periods
the
term
has
been
applied
to
the
first
and
that
of
to
the
latter
menstruation
may
fail
to
be
established
in
consequence
of
organic
defects
or
from
some
abnormal
condition
of
the
blood
and
nervous
system
malformation
of
the
vagina
retention
of
the
menses
may
result
from
malformation
of
the
vaginal
canal
which
sometimes
terminates
before
it
reaches
the
womb
being
simply
a
short
closed
sac
if
the
uterus
and
ovaries
are
perfect
all
the
feminine
characteristics
are
manifest
and
a
vaginal
exploration
discloses
the
nature
of
the
difficulty
if
however
the
sides
of
this
passage
adhere
in
consequence
of
previous
inflammation
they
may
be
carefully
separated
by
a
surgical
operation
and
this
function
restored
absence
or
malformation
of
the
womb
the
uterus
may
be
deformed
or
entirely
absent
and
yet
there
be
an
inclination
or
symptoms
indicative
of
an
effort
to
establish
this
function
the
individual
may
be
delicate
in
organization
graceful
in
bearing
refined
and
attractive
in
all
feminine
ways
and
yet
this
organ
may
be
so
defective
as
to
preclude
the
establishment
of
the
menstrual
function
sometimes
there
is
merely
an
occlusion
of
the
of
the
uterus
the
perforation
of
which
removes
all
difficulty
in
others
the
of
the
womb
is
filled
with
a
morbid
growth
or
the
walls
of
its
canal
are
adherent
as
the
result
of
inflammation
and
may
be
separated
by
a
small
silver
or
ivory
probe
and
the
menses
be
thus
liberated
imperforate
hymen
the
hymen
is
a
circular
or
semilunar
membrane
which
imperfectly
closes
the
outer
orifice
of
the
vagina
in
the
virgin
when
of
a
semilunar
shape
it
usually
occupies
the
lower
or
posterior
portion
of
the
canal
leaving
an
opening
in
the
upper
or
anterior
portion
varying
from
the
size
of
a
quill
to
that
of
a
thimble
through
which
the
menstrual
fluid
exudes
this
membrane
is
usually
ruptured
and
destroyed
by
the
first
sexual
intercourse
and
hence
its
presence
has
been
considered
evidence
of
virginity
its
absence
however
must
not
be
considered
a
conclusive
evidence
of
sexual
intercourse
for
as
dunglison
says
many
circumstances
of
an
innocent
character
may
occasion
a
rupture
or
destruction
of
this
membrane
it
is
often
absent
in
children
soon
after
birth
while
it
may
remain
entire
after
copulation
hence
the
presence
of
the
hymen
does
not
prove
virginity
nor
does
its
absence
prove
incontinence
although
its
presence
would
be
evidence
of
continence
sometimes
this
membrane
when
not
imperforate
is
so
thick
and
strong
as
to
render
sexual
intercourse
impossible
and
requires
a
cutting
operation
to
open
the
vagina
several
such
cases
have
been
operated
upon
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
it
occasionally
happens
that
the
hymen
is
entire
or
imperforate
at
birth
this
may
not
be
discovered
before
puberty
but
when
this
period
arrives
and
the
menstrual
discharge
takes
place
into
the
vagina
the
female
will
suffer
from
the
retention
and
accumulation
of
this
secretion
and
ultimately
a
tumor
or
a
protrusion
of
the
membrane
which
closes
the
vagina
will
occur
giving
rise
to
severe
pain
and
other
serious
symptoms
the
retained
menstrual
fluid
increasing
in
quantity
at
every
monthly
period
dilates
the
womb
as
well
as
the
vagina
and
even
the
fallopian
tubes
become
distended
presenting
at
length
an
urgent
necessity
for
relief
treatment
this
condition
admits
of
relief
only
by
operative
surgery
the
operation
consists
in
dividing
the
hymen
by
a
crucial
incision
thus
allowing
the
accumulated
fluid
to
be
discharged
after
which
the
vagina
is
cleansed
by
syringing
it
with
warm
water
absence
of
the
ovaries
let
us
suppose
the
case
of
a
young
woman
who
has
fully
reached
the
period
of
puberty
without
having
menstruated
all
the
organs
which
we
have
described
are
manifestly
developed
she
is
healthy
vigorous
robust
and
able
to
exercise
freely
or
to
engage
in
laborious
occupations
but
we
notice
that
her
voice
is
not
sweetly
feminine
nor
is
her
presence
timid
tender
and
winning
there
is
wanting
that
diffident
sexual
consciousness
which
gently
woos
and
at
the
same
time
modestly
repels
and
tends
to
awaken
interest
curiosity
and
desire
considering
also
that
she
has
never
manifested
any
inclination
to
menstruate
we
are
irresistibly
led
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ovaries
are
wanting
the
delicate
mustache
upon
the
upper
lip
the
undeveloped
breasts
the
coarse
features
and
her
taste
for
masculine
pursuits
all
concur
in
this
diagnosis
thus
we
account
for
the
harshness
of
the
voice
fitted
for
command
rather
than
to
express
the
mellow
persuasive
cadences
of
love
such
a
malformation
can
not
be
remedied
retention
and
suppression
from
morbid
conditions
of
the
blood
as
well
as
suppression
of
the
menses
may
result
from
an
abnormal
state
of
the
blood
the
first
condition
which
demands
our
attention
under
this
head
is
in
robust
plethoric
females
the
menses
are
sometimes
very
tardy
in
their
appearance
and
every
month
the
attempt
to
establish
this
function
is
attended
with
pain
in
the
head
loins
and
back
chilliness
nausea
and
bloating
of
the
abdomen
sometimes
there
is
intolerance
of
light
or
sound
and
cerebral
congestion
amounting
almost
to
apoplectic
symptoms
the
pulse
is
full
and
strong
the
blood
abundant
and
surcharged
with
red
corpuscles
such
persons
may
be
accustomed
to
luxurious
living
and
there
is
evidently
a
predisposition
to
abnormal
activity
of
the
alimentary
functions
treatment
we
may
briefly
suggest
that
such
subjects
should
engage
in
laborious
physical
exercise
in
order
to
expend
the
surplus
of
vitality
and
should
lessen
the
daily
amount
of
food
taken
and
use
that
which
is
light
and
unstimulating
we
should
also
prevent
the
determination
of
blood
to
the
head
by
keeping
it
cool
and
the
feet
warm
and
by
increasing
the
flow
of
blood
to
the
extremities
the
volume
of
the
circulation
may
be
diminished
by
acting
upon
the
natural
outlets
such
as
the
skin
kidneys
and
bowels
the
proper
means
and
appliances
for
quickening
the
circulation
of
the
blood
are
indicated
and
friction
upon
the
surface
bathing
the
daily
use
of
such
cathartics
as
pleasant
pellets
and
finally
the
use
of
some
general
uterine
stimulant
such
as
pierce
favorite
prescription
will
generally
prove
successful
in
cases
of
amenorrhea
resulting
from
plethora
retention
and
suppression
from
anæmia
to
describe
the
condition
of
the
patient
whose
blood
is
low
and
deprived
of
the
richness
warmth
and
bloom
it
once
possessed
when
it
kindled
admiration
and
enthusiasm
in
others
is
but
to
give
a
picture
of
a
numerous
class
of
female
invalids
it
is
sad
to
see
beauty
fading
vigor
waning
and
bright
disease
or
consumption
slowly
wasting
the
blood
and
consuming
the
vital
cells
until
the
spirit
can
no
longer
dwell
in
its
earthly
abode
and
death
claims
the
skeleton
for
dust
chronic
decline
with
its
attendant
anæmia
may
be
induced
by
bad
habits
destitution
or
constitutional
depravity
sickly
forms
wrecks
of
health
address
our
senses
on
every
side
all
these
subjects
evidently
once
had
a
capital
in
life
sufficient
if
properly
and
carefully
husbanded
to
comfortably
afford
them
vital
stamina
and
length
of
days
alas
they
have
squandered
their
estate
perchance
in
idleness
and
luxurious
living
or
have
wasted
it
in
vanities
or
misdirected
ambition
having
become
bankrupts
in
health
there
is
necessarily
a
failure
of
the
menstrual
function
and
then
follows
a
all
the
blame
of
the
insolvency
and
general
derangement
is
unjustly
attributed
to
the
of
the
duties
of
the
uterus
thus
this
organ
is
altogether
upon
the
general
health
for
its
functional
ability
yet
frequently
treatment
is
instituted
to
compel
menstruation
regardless
of
the
condition
of
the
system
thus
the
enfeebled
uterus
is
wrongfully
held
responsible
for
general
disorder
because
it
ceases
to
act
when
it
would
further
deplete
the
blood
and
thus
materially
contribute
to
the
already
existing
chronic
decline
no
matter
what
are
the
causes
of
this
decline
whether
they
are
the
follies
of
fashion
the
effect
of
indolence
debility
in
consequence
of
insufficient
food
perversion
of
nutrition
by
irregular
habits
lack
of
exercise
or
the
taking
of
drastic
medicines
the
result
is
anæmia
and
amenorrhea
treatment
we
would
suggest
in
such
cases
a
nutritious
diet
increased
exercise
cleanliness
regular
habits
hard
beds
and
useful
employment
the
diet
may
be
improved
by
animal
broths
roasted
meats
fresh
beef
mutton
chicken
or
eggs
and
the
dress
should
be
comfortable
warm
and
permit
freedom
of
motion
the
patient
should
indulge
in
amusing
exercises
walking
swinging
riding
games
of
croquet
traveling
singing
percussing
the
expanded
chest
or
engage
in
healthful
calisthenic
exercises
the
hygienic
treatment
of
this
form
of
amenorrhea
then
consists
in
physical
culture
regular
bathing
and
the
regulation
of
the
bowels
if
constipated
as
suggested
in
this
volume
under
the
head
of
constipation
the
should
be
directed
to
enriching
the
blood
improving
nutrition
toning
up
the
generative
organs
and
the
health
of
the
whole
system
this
requires
the
employment
of
uterine
and
general
tonics
and
pierce
favorite
prescription
which
is
sold
by
druggists
happily
combines
the
properties
required
it
improves
digestion
enriches
the
blood
exercises
a
tonic
and
gently
stimulating
effect
upon
the
uterus
and
ovaries
and
thus
promotes
the
function
of
menstruation
it
is
not
a
strong
emmenagogue
but
operates
slowly
yet
surely
and
in
accordance
with
physiological
laws
being
eminently
congenial
in
its
effects
upon
the
female
system
and
hence
not
liable
to
do
harm
there
is
danger
in
employing
active
driving
medicines
besides
no
emmenagogue
however
powerful
can
establish
the
menstrual
function
so
long
as
the
system
is
in
a
debilitated
condition
and
the
blood
reduced
the
restorative
effects
of
the
favorite
prescription
should
be
secured
by
administering
it
regularly
in
from
one
to
two
teaspoonful
doses
three
or
four
times
a
day
for
several
weeks
and
as
the
system
is
built
up
and
those
symptoms
appear
which
indicate
a
return
of
the
menses
their
visitation
may
be
encouraged
by
the
use
of
hot
foot
and
and
free
doses
of
pierce
compound
extract
of
but
the
latter
should
only
be
used
when
symptoms
of
approaching
menstruation
are
manifested
by
following
out
this
course
of
treatment
a
soft
flush
will
gradually
take
the
place
of
the
pallor
of
the
cheeks
the
appetite
will
return
and
the
health
will
be
restored
acute
suppression
of
the
menses
may
be
caused
by
emotions
as
excessive
joy
or
by

dysmenorrhea
painful
menstruation
from
its
greek
derivation
signifies
a
monthly
flow
and
is
applied
to
menstruation
when
that
function
becomes
painful
and
difficult
menstruation
like
other
healthy
operations
of
the
body
should
be
painless
but
too
frequently
it
is
the
case
that
discomfort
and
distress
commence
hours
before
the
flow
appears
and
continue
with
increasing
pain
sickness
at
the
stomach
and
vomiting
until
the
patient
has
to
take
to
the
bed
when
the
discharge
does
occur
speedy
relief
is
sometimes
obtained
and
the
patient
suffers
no
more
during
that
menstrual
period
with
others
the
commencement
of
the
function
is
painless
but
from
six
to
hours
after
the
flow
is
arrested
and
the
patient
then
experiences
acute
suffering
pain
may
be
felt
in
the
back
loins
and
down
the
thighs
sometimes
it
is
of
a
lancinating
neuralgic
kind
at
others
it
is
more
like
colic
frequently
the
distress
causes
lassitude
fever
general
uneasiness
and
a
sense
of
lethargy
there
are
those
who
suffer
more
or
less
during
the
entire
period
of
the
flow
while
the
distress
of
others
terminates
at
the
time
when
a
membranous
cast
is
expelled
for
convenience
of
description
dysmenorrhea
has
been
divided
into
the
following
varieties
congestive
inflammatory
and
neuralgic
of
dysmenorrhea
sometimes
called
or
occurs
when
there
is
excessive
sensibility
of
the
ovaries
and
uterine
nerves
which
sympathetically
especially
to
cutaneous
biliary
and
sexual
irritation
and
when
ovarian
or
uterine
irritation
is
communicated
to
distant
in
the
first
class
usually
comprising
lean
persons
of
an
encephalic
temperament
whatever
disorders
the
functions
of
the
general
system
instantaneously
reflects
upon
the
ovaries
and
uterine
nerves
and
the
menstrual
function
is
correspondingly
disturbed
and
instead
of
being
painless
the
flow
becomes
spasmodic
with
paroxysms
of
distress
in
the
second
class
which
includes
those
persons
who
are
plethoric
the
ovarian
and
uterine
nerves
seem
to
be
the
origin
and
centre
of
irritation
which
is
sometimes
so
severe
as
to
cause
indescribable
pain
we
have
known
women
who
affirmed
that
the
severity
of
labor
pains
was
not
so
great
as
that
from
this
cause
in
one
instance
the
subject
suffered
thus
for
eleven
years
and
then
became
a
mother
and
has
ever
asserted
that
her
periodic
suffering
was
far
more
intense
than
the
pain
experienced
during
her
confinement
these
neuralgic
pains
fly
along
the
tracks
of
nerves
to
different
organs
and
capriciously
dart
from
point
to
point
with
marvelous
celerity
producing
nausea
headache
and
sometimes
delirium
in
the
congestive
variety
of
dysmenorrhea
the
menstrual
period
may
be
ushered
in
without
pain
after
a
few
hours
the
pulse
becomes
stronger
and
more
rapid
the
skin
grows
hot
and
dry
the
menses
stop
there
is
uneasiness
restlessness
and
severe
pelvic
pains
evidently
the
mucous
membranes
of
the
fallopian
tubes
and
uterus
have
become
congested
and
the
pain
results
from
the
arrest
of
the
functional
process
the
exudation
of
blood
the
causes
are
plethora
exposure
to
cold
excitement
of
the
emotions
or
passions
and
a
morbid
condition
of
the
blood
sometimes
congestion
arises
in
consequence
of
a
displacement
of
the
uterus
in
the
inflammatory
variety
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
uterus
is
the
seat
of
irritation
the
blood
flows
into
the
capillary
vessels
in
greater
abundance
than
is
natural
and
those
vessels
become
and
enfeebled
and
so
altered
in
their
sensibility
as
to
produce
local
excitement
and
pain
it
may
be
associated
with
inflammation
of
the
ovaries
peritoneum
or
bladder
upon
the
return
of
the
menses
there
is
a
dull
heavy
fixed
pain
in
the
pelvis
which
continues
until
the
period
is
completed
there
is
generally
tenderness
of
the
uterus
and
also
leucorrhea
during
the
intervals
between
each
monthly
flow
in
the
membranous
variety
of
dysmenorrhea
the
entire
mucous
membrane
which
lines
the
cavity
of
the
uterus
in
consequence
of
some
morbid
process
is
gradually
detached
and
expelled
at
the
menstrual
period
symptoms
there
are
steady
pains
at
the
commencement
of
the
menstrual
flow
and
they
increase
in
violence
and
become
decidedly
expulsive
the
mouth
of
the
uterus
gradually
dilates
and
finally
the
membrane
is
forced
out
of
the
uterus
attended
with
a
slight
flow
of
blood
and
an
entire
subsidence
of
the
pain
the
treatment
in
all
the
preceding
varieties
of
dysmenorrhea
should
consist
of
measures
to
determine
the
circulation
of
the
blood
to
the
surface
and
increase
the
perspiratory
functions
congestion
and
inflammation
of
the
internal
organs
are
generally
induced
by
exposure
to
cold
or
from
insufficient
clothing
sometimes
they
follow
from
neglect
of
the
skin
which
is
not
kept
clean
and
its
excretory
function
encouraged
by
warm
clothing
the
domestic
treatment
at
the
monthly
crisis
should
be
commenced
by
the
administration
of
hot
foot
and
after
which
the
patient
should
be
warmly
covered
in
bed
and
bottles
of
hot
water
applied
to
the
extremities
back
and
thighs
pierce
compound
extract
of

be
given
in
full
doses
frequently
repeated
to
secure
its
diaphoretic
emmenagogue
and
anodyne
effects
which
for
this
painful
affection
is
unsurpassed
for
the
radical
cure
of
this
disease
whether
of
a
congestive
inflammatory
or
neuralgic
character
pierce
favorite
prescription
which
is
sold
by
druggists
is
a
pleasant
and
specific
remedy
which
will
most
speedily
correct
the
abnormal
condition
that
produces
the
trouble
and
thereby
obviate
the
necessity
of
passing
this
terrible
ordeal
at
every
monthly
period
the
patient
should
take
two
teaspoonfuls
of
the
medicine
three
times
a
day
and
keep
up
its
use
in
these
doses
for
weeks

suffice
to
cure
but
in
most
cases
a
longer
season
is
required
in
the
end
the

will
not
be

the

may
be
constant

acute
when

here
partial
adhesion
of
the

and
easy
exit
of
the

fluid
in
many
cases
the
contracted
and
narrowed
condition
of
the
canal
of
the
cervix
seems
to
be
a
congenital
deformity
for
we
can
trace
it
to
no
perceptible
cause
it
is
also
true
that
contraction
and
partial
or
even
complete
stricture
of
the
cervix
or
neck
of
the
womb
often
results
from
the
improper
application
of
strong
caustics
to
this
passage
by
incompetent
and
ignorant
surgeons
every
person
has
observed
the
contraction
of
tissue
caused
by
a
severe
burn
which
often
produces
such
a
distortion
of
the
injured
part
as
to
disfigure
the
body
for
life
a
similar
result
is
produced
when
the
neck
of
the
womb
is
burned
with
strong
caustics
the
tissues
are
destroyed
and
as
the
parts
heal
the
tissues
firmly
contract
forming
a
hard
unyielding
cicatrix
thus
constricting
the
neck
of
the
womb
through
which
the
menses
pass
into
the
vagina

treatment
from
the
nature
of
this
malady
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
no
medical
treatment
can
effect
a
radical
cure
we
must
therefore
resort
to
surgery
in
a
small
proportion
of
cases
the
stricture
may
be
cured
by
repeated
dilations
of
the
constricted
part
of
the
cervical
canal
this
may
be
accomplished
by
using
a
very
smooth
probe
which
is
fine
at
the
point
but
increases
in
size
so
that
its
introduction
will
widen
and
expand
the
orifice
and
canal
the
stricture
may
be
overcome
in
many
cases
by
using
different
sized
probes
in
some
instances
we
have
employed
the
uterine
dilator
represented
by
fig
we
have
also
introduced
and
sponge
tents
into
the
neck
of
the
womb
and
allowed
them
to
remain
until
they
expanded
by
absorbing
moisture
from
the
surrounding
tissues
the
latter
process
is
simple
and
in
many
cases
preferable
by
means
of
a
speculum
see
figs
and
the
mouth
of
the
womb
is
brought
into
view
and
the
surgeon
seizes
a
small
tent
with
a
pair
of
forceps
and
gently
presses
it
into
the
neck
of
the
womb
where
it
is
left
to
expand
and
thus
dilate
the
passage
if
there
seems
to
be
a
persistent
disposition
of
the
circular
fibers
of
the
cervix
to
contract
and
thus
close
the
canal
a
surgical
operation
will
be
necessary
to
insure
permanent
relief
in
performing
this
operation
we
use
a
cutting
instrument
called
the
hysterotome
see
figs
and
by
the
use
of
this
instrument
the
cervical
canal
is
enlarged
by
an
incision
on
either
side
the
operation
is
but
slightly
painful
and
in
the
hands
of
a
competent
surgeon
is
perfectly
safe
we
have
operated
in
a
very
large
number
of
cases
and
have
never
known
any
alarming
or
dangerous
symptoms
to
result
after
the
incision
a
small
roll
of
cotton
thoroughly
saturated
with
glycerine
is
applied
to
the
incised
parts
and
a
larger
roll
is
introduced
into
the
vagina
the
second
day
after
the
operation
the
cotton
is
removed
the
edges
of
the
wound
separated
by
a
uterine
sound
or
probe
and
a
cotton
tent
introduced
into
the
cervix
and
allowed
to
remain
so
that
it
will
expand
and
thus
open
the
wound
to
its
full
extent
this
treatment
must
be
thoroughly
applied
and
repeated
every
alternate
day
until
the
incised
parts
are
perfectly
healed

can
not

why
it

the

the
constricted
cervix
causes
no
pain
they
often
being
entirely
unconscious
of
the
making
of
the
incision
the
explanation
is
easy
the
cervix
uteri
or
neck
of
the
womb
is
supplied
with
but
few
nerves
of
sensation
and
is
almost
as
destitute
of
sensation
as
the
finger
or
toe
nails
the
paring
of
which
causes
not
the
slightest
pain
on
this
account
we
never
find
it
necessary
to
administer
chloroform
or
any
other
anæsthetic
when
undertaking
this
operation
if
the
patient
be
extremely
sensitive
the
application
to
the
cervix
of
a
weak
solution
of
cocaine
is
quite
sufficient
to
completely
benumb

profuse
menstruation
the
word

is

derivation
literally
means
breaking

is
employed
to
designate
profuse

this
disorder
must
not
be

is
marked
by
an
inordinate

however
in

the

fungous
degeneration
of

and
tumors
within
that
organ
as
these
subjects
will
be
severally
considered
hereafter
we
shall
here
dismiss
them
with
this
brief
notice
profuse
menstruation
is
very
prone
to
occur
in
young
women
of
a
lymphatic
temperament
whose
organs
are
sleazy
in
texture
treatment
to
control
the
excessive
flow
the
patient
should
remain
in
her
bed
and
assume
the
recumbent
position
until
the
period
is
passed
if
circumstances
prevent
strict
compliance
with
this
rule
it
should
be
observed
as
nearly
as
possible
warmth
should
be
applied
to
the
feet
and
cold
cloths
which
ought
to
be
removed
as
soon
as
they
become
warm
by
the
heat
of
the
body
should
be
repeatedly
placed
upon
the
back
and
abdomen
a
strong
tea
made
from
cinnamon
bark
or
leaves
or
bark
taken
freely
will
prove
very
efficacious
in
checking
the
flow
the
fluid
extract
of
ergot
in
doses
of
from
half
a
teaspoonful
to
a
teaspoonful
in
a
little
water
or
cinnamon
tea
is
one
of
the
most
effectual
remedies
in
this
affection
another
valuable
remedy
for
arresting
menorrhagia
is
an
infusion
of
canada
fleabane
or
the
oil
of
this
plant
may
be
administered
in
doses
of
from
five
to
ten
drops
on
sugar
gallic
acid
is
also
a
good
styptic
to
employ
in
these
cases
if
there
is
febrile
excitement
a
hard
pulse
frequent
and
throbbing
and
if
there
is
headache
thirst
parched
lips
hot
and
dry
skin
as
is
sometimes
the
case
then
menorrhagia
is
due
to
an
augmented
action
of
the
heart
and
arteries
and
the
indication
of
treatment
is
to
diminish
vascular
action
this
may
be
temporarily
accomplished
by
the
use
of
veratrum
viride
which
should
be
continued
until
the
flow
is
sufficiently
diminished
the
means
already
suggested
will
generally
prove
effective
in
controlling
the
inordinate
flow
at
the
time
treatment
that
will
produce
permanent
relief
should
then
be
adopted
the
condition
of
the
skin
kidneys
and
bowels
requires
attention
for
noxious
elements
should
not
be
retained
in
the

to
give

to

pelvic
organs
we
know
of
nothing
more
specific
in
its
effects
than
pierce
favorite

which
is
sold
by
druggists
it
should
be
taken
continuously
for
weeks
in
order
to
fully
correct
the
extremely
weakened
condition
of
that
organ
it
also
aids
nutrition
and
thus
tones
up
the
general
system
so
that
in
the
form
of
profuse
menstruation
resulting
from
debility
the
patient
is
strengthened
her
blood
enriched
and
her
nervousness
quieted
which
constitutes
the
necessary
treatment
to
make
the
cure
permanent
as
women
approach
the
critical
age
and
menstruation
ceases
if
they
are
anæmic
their
condition
is
pitiable
this
period
is
popularly
denominated
the

the

when
this
crisis
has
been
preceded
by
excessive
labor
when
intemperance
or
excesses
of
any
kind
have
deranged
the
bodily

and

when

when
the
insidious
progress
of

then
there
is
danger
of

and
a
protracted
and
profuse

which
favors

the
treatment
of
this
form
of
menorrhagia
does
not
differ
from
that
already
suggested

be
light

and
daily

such
as
walking

an

required
which

impairment

very
frequently

to

the
turn
of
life
cessation
of
the
menses
menstruation
commonly
occurs
at
regular
monthly
intervals
during
a
period
of
about
thirty
years
the
time
for
its
cessation
depends
somewhat
upon
the
date
of
its
first
appearance
in
the
temperate
zones
it
commences
at
about
the
fifteenth
year
and
consequently
should
terminate
at
the
year
instances
are
common
however
in
which
it
has
been
prolonged
until
the
fiftieth
and
even
to
the
year
in
warm
climates
it
commences
and
terminates
at
an
earlier
age
as
women
approach
the
critical
period
of
life
if
the
general
health
and
habits
be
good
the
discharge
may
gradually
diminish
and
at
length
totally
disappear
without
producing
any
particular
inconvenience
but
this
seldom
happens
more
frequently
the
discharge
is
entirely
absent
for
six
or
seven
weeks
and
when
it
does
return
it
is
more
copious
than
usual
in
some
cases
the
flow
is
not
only
too
profuse
but
too
frequent
many
months
may
elapse
before
the
menses
return
and
even
then
they
are
apt
to
be
very
pale
and
deficient
in
quantity
the
fluctuations
of
this
function
occasion
irregularities
and
disturbances
of
the
general
health
when
the
flow
of
blood
is
diverted
from
the
uterus
it
is
liable
to
be
directed
to
the
head
or
some
other
part
of
the
body
in
fact
there
appears
to
be
constitutional
agitation
and
disorders
of
all
the
organs
perhaps
one
reason
for
calling
this
a
critical
period
is
that
if
there
is
a
morbid
tendency
in
the
system
a
disposition
to
develop
tumors
of
the
breast
or
uterus
these
are
very
liable
to
make
rapid
progress
at
this
time
since
they
are
not
relieved
by
the
customary
local
exudation
of
blood
it
is
a
time
favorable
to
the
awakening
of
latent
disorder
and
morbid
growths
for
at
the
decline
of
the
menstrual
function
the
uterus
is
not
so
capable
of
resisting
vitiating
influences
there
is
greater
liability
to
irritation
of
the
bladder
and
rectum
and
the
menstrual
flow
may
be
superseded
by
a
white
acrid
discharge
caused
by
an
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
vagina
even
if
the
system
be
not
enfeebled
by
excessive
losses
of
blood
debility
may
result
from
a
continued
irritation
of
the
uterine
organs
and
cause
the
morbid
discharge
the
nervous
system
sympathetically
responds
becoming
exceedingly
irritable
and
thus
implicating
in
this
derangement
every
bodily
organ
in
some
constitutions
the
change
of
any
habit
is
almost
impossible
particularly
if
it
is
improperly
acquired
or
detrimental
to
health
and
so
we
have
sometimes
thought
respecting
this
function
that
the
more
it
has
been
abused
and
perverted
during
the
time
of
its
natural
activity
the
greater
is
the
disturbance
occasioned
when
it
ceases
treatment
there
should
be
regularity
in
all
the
habits
of
life
women
are
too
apt
to
approach
this
important
period
without
due
care
and
consideration
when
the
physical
system
is
about
to
suspend
a
function
it
is
folly
to
endeavor
to
perform
the
labor
or
assume
the
responsibilities
which
were
permissible
when
the
constitution
was
more
robust
how
the
duties
of
each
day
and
hour
weigh
upon
the
energies
of
the
mother
what
intense
solicitude
and
yearning
she
experiences
how
unselfish
is
that
mother
who
each
day
works
steadily
and
faithfully
for
others
and
who
is
conscious
of
the
hidden
dangers
that
lurk
around
her
pathway
with
confiding
faith
and
love
she
commends
the
interests
of
her
children
to
him
who
doeth
all
things
well
she
anticipates
the
wants
of
her
family
and
strives
to
supply
the
desired
comforts
thus
wasting
her
strength
in
the
labors
prompted
by
her
loving
nature
would
it
not
be
a
greater
comfort
to
those
children
to
have
the
counsel
of
their
dear
mother
in
later
years
than
to
have
the
bitter
reflection
that
she
sacrificed
her
health
and
life
for
their
gratification
unconsciously
perhaps
but
none
the
less
certainly
do
women
enter
upon
this
period
regardless
of
the
care
they
ought
to
bestow
upon
themselves
without
sufficient
forethought
or
an
understanding
of
the
functional
changes
taking
place
they
their
strength
until
by
continuous
exertion
they
break
down
under
those
labors
which
to
persons
of
their
age
are
excessive
and
injurious
is
it
strange
when
woman
has
thus
exhausted
her
energies
when
her
body
trembles
with
fatigue
and
her
mind
is
agitated
with
responsibilities
that
the
menses
capriciously
return
or
the
uterus
is
unable
to
withstand
congestion
and
capillary
hemorrhage
becomes
excessive
if
the
physical
system
had
not
been
thus
exhausted
it
would
have
exercised
its
powers
for
the
conservation
of
health
and
strength
it
is
better
to
be
forewarned
of
the
ills
to
which
we
are
liable
and
fortify
ourselves
against
them
rather
than
squander
the
strength

for

preservation

every
consider
her
situation
and
properly
prepare
for
that
grand
climacteric
which
so
materially
influences
her

the

by

leucorrhea
whites
leucorrhea
is
the
symptomatic
manifestation
of
some
uterine
or
vaginal
affection
vulgarly
called
whites
we
say
for
the
white
or
yellowish
discharge
which
we
term
leucorrhea
is
not
a
disease
but
a
symptom
of
some
uterine
or
vaginal
disorder
we
call
it
a
discharge
to
distinguish
it
from
the
menses
and
uterine
hemorrhages
it
varies
however
in
color
and
consistency
from
a
white
glairy
mucus
to
a
yellow
or
greenish
purulent
fetid
matter
sometimes
it
has
a
curdled
appearance
at
others
it
is
of
the
consistency
of
cream
leucorrhea
is
the
most
common
symptom
of
uterine
derangement
and
there
are
few
females
who
are
not
affected
by
it
at
some
period
of
life
it
may
originate
either
in
the
vagina
or
uterus
and
it
is
accordingly
termed
either
vaginal
or
uterine
leucorrhea
the
nature
of
leucorrhea
is
analogous
to
that
of
nasal
catarrh
in
a
healthy
state
the
lining
membrane
of
the
genital
organs
secretes
sufficient
mucus
to
moisten
them
but
if
the
mucous
membrane
is
temporarily
congested
or
inflamed
the
secretion
becomes
profuse
irritating
and
offensive
vaginal
and
uterine
leucorrhea
are
essentially
different
in
character
the
former
being
an
acid
and
the
latter
an
alkaline
secretion
and
while
the
first
is
a
creamy
purulent
fluid
the
latter
is
thick
and
ropy
like
the
white
of
an
egg
in
fact
the
latter
discharge
is
rich
in
albuminous
matter
and
hence
its
great
debilitating
effect
upon
the
system
and
if
not
promptly
arrested
it
is
likely
to
produce
pruritus
or
vaginitis
is
indicated
by
intense
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
vagina
when
this
affection
is
present
the
patient
experiences
a
sense
of
burning
heat
aching
and
weight
in
the
region
of
the
vagina
violent
and
throbbing
pains
in
the
pelvis
and
the
discharge
is
profuse
and
very
offensive
there
is
also
a
frequent
desire
to
urinate
and
the
passage
of
the
urine
causes
a
sensation
of
scalding
pruritus
vulvae
the
discharge
irritates
the
nerves
of
the
external
genital
parts
thus
producing
an
almost
unendurable
itching
scratching
or
rubbing
the
parts
only
aggravates
the
affection
the
patient
is
tormented
night
and
day
is
deprived
of
sleep
and
naturally
becomes
despondent
pruritus
vulvae
in
its
severest
forms
is
often
developed
when
the
discharge
is
scarcely
noticeable
it
is
the
most
common
result
or
accompaniment
of
leucorrhea
vulvitis
this
term
indicates
an
inflammation
of
the
lining
membrane
of
the
external
genital
parts
sometimes
the
inflammation
extends
to
the
deeper
tissues
causing
great
pain
and
even
suppuration
resulting
in
the
formation
of
an
abscess
the
attack
is
indicated
by
redness
swelling
and
a
feverish
state
of
the
affected
parts
which
is
quickly
followed
by
a
profuse

of

and
in
some
instances
small

are
formed
on

treatment
we
have
dwelt
upon
leucorrhea
because
of
its
prevalence
and
in
order
to
exhibit
the
various
forms
it
may
assume
these
reasons
long
ago
prompted
us
to
investigate
it
and
ascertaining
the
derangement
to
consist
in
a
relaxation
of
the
walls
of
the
vagina
attendant
upon
depressed
vitality
for
many
years
we
experimented
with
various
medicines
to
find
those
that
would
exercise
specific
properties
in
restoring
the
tissues
involved
to
a
natural
condition
thereby
arresting
the
abnormal
discharge
our
efforts
in
that
direction
have
been
very
successful
and
our
expectations
more
than
realized
the
treatment
which
we
shall
recommend
is
rational
based
upon
the
pathological
conditions
of
the
disease
and
has
been
attended
with
the
greatest
success
it
embraces
the
use
of
those
general
restoratives
and
specific
uterine
tonics
so
harmoniously
combined
in
pierce
favorite

a
remedy
which
has
achieved
unparalleled
success
in
the
cure
of
this
affection
and
won
the
highest
praise
from
thousands
of
grateful
women
it
many
cases
it
is
well
to
accompany
its
use
with
alterative
treatment
for
which
the
golden
medical
discovery
will
be
found
especially
effective
it
is
an
absurd
practice
to
arrest
the
discharge
with
astringent
injections
the
weak
and
lax
walls
of
the
vagina
as
well
as
the
other
tissues
of
the
system
require
strength
and
this
can
be
gained
only
by
the
use
of
general
and
special
tonics
appropriate
injections
as

will
very
much
in
the

the

is
a
special
tonic
for
the
affected

and
the
golden
medical
discovery
is
the
best
general
alterative
of
which
we
have
any
knowledge
they
may
be
taken
in
alternate
doses
every

if
the

is
very
pale

anæmic
one
drachm
of

may
be
advantageously
added
to
each
bottle
of
the

if
the

be
employed
as
it
is
insoluble
the
bottle
should
be
well
shaken
every
time
before
using
the
functions
of
the
skin
should
be
kept
active
by
frequent
baths
and
the
patient

able
should
walk

ride
in
the
open
air
and
freely
expose
herself
to
the
sunshine
if
the

weak
to

much
she
should
go

no
less
important

many

are
sickly

we
can
not
too
strongly
urge
in
this
as

other
chronic
diseases
peculiar
to
women
that
the

be
kept
regular

prove
most
beneficial

very
soothing

how
to
use
vaginal
injections
we
usually
recommend
the
fountain
syringe
illustrated
in
fig
as
the
most
convenient
instrument
for
administering
vaginal
injections
the
fountains
supplied
by
us
are
of
soft
rubber
and
have
extra
nozzles
with
which
to
make
rectal
nasal
or
ear
irrigations
there
is
also
a
large
long
nozzle
for
vaginal
injections
illustration
fig
soft
syringe
it
is
channeled
so
is
to
permit
the
free
clearing
away
of
the
secretions
as
the
douche
is
employed
the
fountain
syringe
can
he
used
without
assistance
the
flow
of
fluid
is
gradual
and
with
a
force
that
can
be
varied
by
raising
or
lowering
the
reservoir
yet
is
never
so
great
as
to
be
liable
to
produce
injurious
effects
the
syringes
usually
sold
with
small
nozzles
or
pipes
are
of
little
or
no
value
for
vaginal
injections
in
many
instances
so
small
a
tube
will
pass
readily
into
the
canal
of
the
uterus
and
hence
there
has
frequently
resulted
an
injection
of
a
portion
of
the
fluid
into
the
uterus
itself
producing
severe
pain
it
is
important
therefore
in
using
the
vaginal
douche
to
employ
only
a
large
tube
that
has
grooves
in
its
surface
for
the
free
clearing
away
of
the
fluid
as
it
runs
from
the
fountain
where
it
is
desired
to
obtain
relief
from
a
congested
inflamed
or
sensitive
and
irritable
state
of
the
mucous
surface
the
employment
of
a
large
quantity
of
water
as
hot
as
it
can
be
borne
is
of
the
greatest
remedial
value
it
rapidly
diminishes
the
size
of
the
blood
vessels
and
aids
in
bringing
about
a
normal
circulation
in
the
parts
as
a
rule
in
taking
the
douche
with
the
fountain
syringe
the
rubber
bag
is
filled
and
suspended
from
a
nail
or
hook
at
a
height
of
from
two
to
five
feet
above
the
patient
and
the
fluid
passes
through
the
tube
by
force
of
gravity
thus
requiring
no
muscular
exercise
the
force
of
the
stream
depends
upon
the
height
of
the
fountain
above
the
outlet
nozzle
it
is
only
necessary
that
the
patient
should
assume
a
comfortable
position
where
the
fluid
which
comes
from
the
vaginal
canal
can
flow
into
a
water
closet
or
any
convenient
vessel
after
a
thorough
cleansing
of
the
vaginal
surfaces
of
mucus
by
means
of
the
warm
or
hot
water
it
is
sometimes
advisable
to
inject
remedial
fluids
these
injections
may
readily
be
made
with
the
fountain
or
bulb
syringe
introducing
not
less
than
from
two
to
four
ounces
this
may
be
retained
sufficiently
long
to
exert
its
remedial
effects
upon
the
mucous
surface
which
usually
takes
from
five
to
eight
minutes
the
hips
should
be
elevated
and
the
nozzle
of
the
syringe
surrounded
by
a
napkin
or
other
similar
material
upon
which
moderate
compression
can
be
made
so
as
to
retain
the
fluid
in
the
vagina
for
the
necessary
period
when
suffering
from
any
uterine
trouble
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
severe
fatigue
the
amount
and
character
of
exercise
should
be
suited
to
the
condition
of
the
patient
while
most
important
of
all
the
strictest
abstinence
from
sexual
intercourse
should
be
observed
to
those
who
are
unable
readily
to
obtain
the

recommended

investigated

personal
solicitude

it

a
delicate
subject
involving
personal
considerations

one
who
can
not
connect
their
unfortunate
situation
with
any
of
the
incidents
which
enter
into

this

devoting

undivided
attention
to

affections

having

facilities

of
such
cases
we
have
been
applied
to
in
innumerable
instances
to
ascertain
the
causes
of
barrenness
and
effect
its
removal
it
is
admitted
that
the
question
of
a
woman
sterility
is
practically
decided
in
the
first
three
years
of
married
life
for
statistics
show
that
less
than
ten
out
of
a
hundred
women
who
do
not
indicate
their
fertility
in
the
first
three
years
of
wedlock
ever
bear
children
we
have
treated
many
who
gave
no
evidence
of
fertility
for
a
much
longer
period
of
married
life
and
who
afterwards
gave
birth
to
children
we
are
unable
to
state
the
proper
ratio
of
the
number
of
the
married
who
are
childless
much
less
have
we
the
right
to
assume
that
all
who
decline
the
responsibilities
of
motherhood
are
necessarily
barren
causes
the
causes
of
barrenness
may
be
obliteration
of
the
canal
of
the
neck
of
the
womb
sealing
up
of
its
mouth
or
inflammation
resulting
in
adhesion
of
the
walls
of
the
vagina
thus
obstructing
the
passage
to
the
uterus
in
the
latter
case
the
vagina
forms
a
short
closed
sac
in
some
instances
the
vaginal
passage
can
not
be
entered
in
consequence
of
an
imperforate
hymen
again
the
cause
of
barrenness
may
either
be
a
diseased
condition
of
the
ovaries
preventing
them
from
maturing
healthy
germs
or
chronic
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
neck
of
the
uterus
which
does
not
render
conception
impossible
but
improbable
it
is
one
of
the
most
common
causes
of
unfruitfulness
because
the
female
seldom
if
ever
recovers
from
it
spontaneously
it
has
been
known
to
exist
for
twenty
or
thirty
years
chronic
inflammation
of
the
vagina
also
gives
rise
to
acrid
secretions
which
destroy
the
vitality
of
the
spermatozoa
suppression
of
the
menses
or
any
disorder
of
the
uterine
functions
may
disqualify
the
female
for
reproduction
flexions
of
the
uterus
displacements
congestions
and
local
debility
may
likewise
prevent
fertility
sterility
may
result
from
impaired
ovarian
innervation
or
undue
excitement
of
the
nerves
either
of
which
deranges
the
process
of
ovulation
even
too
frequent
indulgence
in
marital
pleasures
sometimes
defeats
conception
prostitutes
who
indulge
in
excessive
and
promiscuous
sexual
intercourse
seldom
become
pregnant
any
thing
that
enfeebles
the
functional
powers
of

system
is
liable
to
disqualify
the
female
for
reproduction
treatment
an
extensive
observation
and
experience
in
the
treatment
of
sterility
convinces
us
that
in
the
majority
of
cases
barrenness
is
due
to
some
form
of
disease
which
can
be
easily
remedied
if
the
passages
through
the
neck
of
the
uterus
be
closed
or
contracted
and
this
is
the
most
frequent
cause
of
sterility
a
very
delicate
surgical
operation
which
causes
little
if
any
pain
or
inconvenience
to
the
patient
will
remove
the
impediment
to
fertility
in
many
of
these
cases
we
have
succeeded
in
removing
the
contraction
and
stricture
of
the
neck
of
the
womb
by
dilatation
when
the
vaginal
walls
are
so
firmly
united
as
to
prevent
copulation
a
surgical
operation
may
be
necessary
to
overcome
their
adhesion
when
the

obstructs
the
vaginal
orifice
a
similar
operation
may
be
necessary

sterility
it
is
proper
that
we
should
suggest
to
the
barren
that
if

intercourse
be
indulged
in
only
very
abstemiously
conception
will
be
more
likely
to
occur
than
if
moderation
be
not
exercised
we
may
also
very
properly
allude
to
the
fact
that
there
is
greater
aptitude
to
fecundation
immediately
before
and
soon
after
the
menstrual
periods
than
at
other
times
in
fact
many
medical
men
believe
that
it
is
impossible
for
conception
to
occur

the
twelfth
day
following

to
within
two
or
three
days

an
elongated
condition
of

by

is
frequently
a
cause
of
sterility
if
this
part
is
elongated
slim
and
pointed
as
shown
in
the
illustration
it
is
apt
to
curve
or
bend
upon
itself
thus
constricting
the

through
it
and
preventing
the
transit
of
seminal
fluid
into
the

eminent

says
even
a

of

the

our
own
observations

the

us
to
believe

chronic

of

a
cause
of

when
enumerating
the
causes
of
barrenness
we
mentioned
that
chronic
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
mouth
and
neck
of
the
womb
was
the
most
common
affection
that
defeats
conception
of
all
diseases
of
female
organs
this
is
without
doubt
the
most
common
and
since
it
does
not
at
first
produce
great
inconvenience
or
immediately
endanger
life
it
does
not
excite
the
attention
which
its
importance
demands
it
is
overlooked
and
when
the
attention
is
directed
to
the
existence
of
this
disease
it
appears
so
trivial
that
it
is
not
regarded
as
being
the
real
cause
of
infertility
in
the
patient
when
this
disease
has
existed
for
a
long
time
the
very
structure
of
the
parts
involved
becomes
changed
the
glands
of
the
cervical
membrane
secrete
a
glairy
mucus
resembling
the
white
or
albuminous
part
of
an
egg
the
secretion
is
thick
and
ropy
and
fills
the
entire
mouth
and
neck
of
the

thus
preventing
the
entrance
of
the

the
mucous
membrane
becomes
thickened
the

extends
to

the

so
trifling
in
quantity
as
scarcely
to
attract
attention
but
after
it
obtains
a
firmer

and
in

cases
it
is
aggravated
by

the

experiences

we
would
at

remark
that
while
health
may
be
regained
by
skillful
treatment
recovery
will
be
gradual
we
especially
wish
to
guard
the
patient
against
entertaining
too
strong
expectations
of
a
speedy
recovery
although
she
may
employ
the
best
treatment
known
yet
from
three
to
five
months
may
elapse
before
a
perfect
cure
can
be
effected
in
persons
of
scrofulous
diathesis
in
whom
the
recuperative
forces
are
weakened
it
is
very
difficult
to
effect
a
radical
cure
it
is
equally
true
however
that
under
domestic
management
alone
thousands
have
been
restored
to
perfect
health
and
fruitfulness
hygienic
management
consists
in
toning
the
functions
of
the
skin
by
daily
bathing
the
surface
of
the
body
and
quickening
the
circulation
by
brisk
friction
the
patient
should
rise
early
in
the
morning
and
exercise
in
the
fresh
and
invigorating
air
those
who
sleep
in
warm
rooms
or
spend
much
of
their
time
in
bed
will
continue
to
have
congestion
of
the
uterus
and
habitual
discharges
from
this
enfeebled
organ
the
patient
should
take
daily
walks
increasing
the
length
of
the
excursion
from
time
to
time
but
not
to
the
extent
of
producing
fatigue
the
bowels
if
constipated
should
be
regulated
strengthen
the
system
by
using
pierce
favorite
prescription
to
each
bottle
of
which
add
two
drachms
of
citrate
or
pyrophosphate
of
iron
the
mouth
and
neck
of
the
uterus
should
be
thoroughly
cleansed
by
the
use
of
the
syringe
as
suggested
for
the
treatment
of
leucorrhea
the
use
of
the
solution
of
pierce
purifying
and
strengthening
lotion
tablets
there
advised
will
also
be
beneficial
if
thoroughly
applied
a
most
valuable
course
of
local
treatment
which
may
be
adopted
by
any
intelligent
lady
without
the
aid
of
a
physician
and
one
that
will
result
in
the
greatest
benefit
when
there
is
morbid
sensibility
congestion
inflammation
or
ulceration
about
the
mouth
or
neck
of
the
womb
consists
in
applying
to
those
parts
a
roll
of
medicated
cotton
or
soft
sponge
allowing
it
to
remain
there
for
twelve
hours
at
a
time
a
piece
of
fine
soft
compressible
sponge
as
large
as
a
hen
egg
or
a
roll
of
cotton
batting
of
that
size
is
thoroughly
saturated
with
pure
glycerine
securely
fasten
to
it
a
stout
cord
a
few
inches
long
the
vagina
and
affected
parts
having
been
thoroughly
cleansed
with
warm
water
and
castile
soap
as
advised
in
the
treatment
of
leucorrhea
the
sponge
or
cotton
should
be
passed
up
the
vagina
with
the
finger
and
pressed
rather
firmly
against
the
mouth
and
neck
of
the
womb
which
being
enlarged
and
consequently
falling
below
its
natural
position
will
generally
be
low
down
in
the
vagina
and
so
hardened
as
to
be
unmistakably
distinguished
from
the
surrounding
parts
by
the
sense
of
touch
the
glycerine
having
a
very
strong
affinity
for
water
will
absorb
large
quantities
of
the
which
has
been
effused
into
the
affected
tissues
in
consequence
of
their
congestion
and
inflammation
and
thus
reduce
the
inflammation
and
enlargement
this
is
the
cause
of
the
profuse
watery
discharge
which
follows
the
application
in
twelve
hours
after
the
sponge
or
cotton
has
been
applied
it
should
be
removed
by
means
of
the
attached
thread
one
end
of
which
has
been
purposely
left
hanging
out
of
the
vagina
then
thoroughly
cleanse
the
vagina
with
warm
water
use
the
solution
of
pierce
lotion
tablets
as
suggested
for
the
treatment
of
leucorrhea
and
repeat
the
glycerine
application
the
following
day
or
every
other
day
if
there
is
no
irritation
or
tenderness
of
the
vagina
add
one
drachm
of
tincture
of
iodine
to
each
ounce
of
the
glycerine
alternating
the
use
of
this
with
that
of
pure
glycerine
or
the
iodine
and
glycerine
may
be
used
every
third
day
and
the
glycerine
alone
on
the
two
intervening
days
as
the
iodine
will
color
the
finger
somewhat
it
is
well
to
know
that
this
unpleasant
effect
may
be
almost
or
entirely
avoided
by
coating
that
member
with
lard
sweet
oil
or
vaseline
the
stain
may
be
readily
removed
with
a
solution
of
iodide
of
potassium
the
use
of
antiseptic
and
healing
suppositories
as
advised
on
an
other
page
under
the
head
of
ulceration
of
the
uterus
will
aid
greatly
in
effecting
a
cure
if
your
medicine
dealer
does
not
have
these
suppositories
in
stock
mail
cents
in
stamps
to
pierce

a
box
will
be
sent

by

it
is
well
to
alternate
pierce

medical
discovery
with
pierce
favorite
prescription
taking
of
each
three
times
a
day
by
persevering
in
this
course
of
treatment
of
those
who
are
thus
afflicted
will
improve
and
be
fully
restored
to
health
fruitfulness
and
happiness
if
barrenness
continue
the
case
should
be
unreservedly
submitted
either
in
person
or
by
letter
to
a
physician
skilled
in
the
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
these
affections
from
the
foregoing
remarks
the
reader
will
perceive
that
there
are
a
variety
of
diseased
conditions
any
one
of
which
may
produce
sterility
it
is
equally
true
that
nearly
all
these
conditions
may
be
easily
cured
by
proper
medical
or
surgical
treatment
a
frequent
cause
of
barrenness
is
stricture
of
the
neck
of
the
uterus
no
medicine
that
a
woman
can
take
or
have
applied
will
remove
this
unnatural
condition
fortunately
however
the
means
to
be
employed
cause
no
pain
are
perfectly
safe
and
the
time
required
to
effect
a
cure
is
short
rarely
over
twenty
or
thirty
days
displacements
of
the
womb
the
relative
positions
of
the
womb
and
surrounding
organs
when
in
a
state
of
health
are
well
illustrated
by
fig
page
the
womb
is
supported
in
its
place
by
resting
upon
the
vaginal
walls
and
by
a
broad
ligament
on
either
side
as
well
as
by
other
connective
tissues
by
general
debility
of
the
system
the
supports
of
the
womb
like
the
other
tissues
of
the
body
become
weakened
and
inadequate
to
perfectly
perform
their
duty
thus
permitting
various
displacements
of
that
organ
prolapsus
or
falling
of
the
uterus
is
a
common
form
of
displacement
it
has
been
erroneously
regarded
as
a
local
uterine
disease
requiring
only
local
treatment
instead
of
being
considered
as
a
symptom
of
general
derangement
and
therefore
requiring
constitutional
treatment
hence
variously
devised
supporters
have
been
invented
to
retain
the
womb
in
position
after
its
replacement
it
is
a
law
of
physiology
that
the
muscular
system
is
strengthened
by
use
and
that
want
of
exercise
weakens
it
the
blacksmith
arm
is
strengthened
and
developed
by
daily
exercise
support
his
arm
in
a
sling
and
the
muscles
will
be
greatly
weakened
and
wasted
so
when
artificial
supports
are
used
to
retain
the
womb
in
position
thereby
relieving
the
supporting
ligaments
and
tissues
of
their
normal
function
the
supports
of
the
uterus
are
still
further
weakened
and
the
prolapsus
will
be
worse
than
before
when
the
artificial
support
is
removed
besides
all
these
mechanical
contrivances
are
irritating
to
the
tissues
of
the
womb
and
vagina
and
frequently
produce
congestion
inflammation
and
even
ulceration
thus
rendering
the
patient
condition
much
worse
than
before
their
employment
these
worse
than
useless
appliances
should
never
be
resorted
to
for
the
temporary
relief
which
they
sometimes
afford
constitutional
treatment
together
with
appropriate
applications
is
the
only
effectual
method
of
remedying
this
morbid
condition
symptoms
when
the
displacement
is
sufficient
to
cause
any
serious

the
prominent
symptoms

rare
cases

causes
as
we
have
already
stated
general
debility
favors
prolapsus
of
the

but
various
general
and
local
circumstances
and
conditions
also
favor
its
occurrence
wearing
heavy
garments
supported
only
by
the
hips
compressing
the
waist
and
abdomen
with
tight
clothing
thus
forcing
the
abdominal
organs
down
upon
the
womb
are
fruitful
causes
of
this
affection
excesses
in
sexual
intercourse
give
rise
to
leucorrhea
producing
a
relaxed
condition
of
the
vagina
upon
which
the
womb
rests
and
in
this
way
one
of
its
supports
is
weakened

this
modern

which

are

is
a
most
irrational
practice
our

got
along
very
well
without
exposing
themselves
to
the
humiliation
and
tortures
of
this
empiricism
we
do
not
wish
to
be
understood
as
undervaluing
or
denying
the
necessity
in
rare
cases
of
examinations
of
the
uterus
or
as
being
unappreciative
of
the
aid
afforded
in
such
investigations
by
the
speculum
and
the
beneficial
effects
of
local
applications
made
directly
to
the
womb
through
that
instrument
what
we
affirm
is
that
such
examinations
and
applications
are
in
the
practice
of
most
modern
physicians
made
unnecessarily
frequent
resulting
many
times
in
lasting
injury

very
naturally
reason
that
there
is
a
fault
in
the
system
at
large
or
in

you
do
not
apply
caustics
to
the
sore
but
you
go
to
work
to
restore
the
blood
and
system
to
a
normal
or
healthy
condition
and
as
soon
as
this
is
accomplished
the
open
and
rebellious
sore
or
ulcer
heals
of
its
own
accord
all
you
have
to
do
locally
to
stimulate
the
ulcer
to
heal
is
to
keep
it
well
cleansed

use
of

cleanse

it
may
be
thoroughly
wet

and
introduced
into
the

pressed
against
the
mouth
of

womb
and
allowed
to
remain
there
for
twelve
hours
when
it
should
be
gently
removed
by
pulling
on
the
attached
string
the
cleansing
lotion
of
soap
and
warm
water
should
be
used
daily
and
followed
by
the
glycerine
application
every
third
night
instead
of

apply

suppositories
pressing
it
well
up
against
the
mouth
of

and
letting
it
remain
there
to
slowly
dissolve
this
will
give
far
better
curative
results
than
the
application
of
nitrate
of
silver
or
other
caustics
so
generally
used
by

besides
it
has
the
great
advantage
of
being
entirely
harmless
in

of
the
parts
to
which
it
is
applied

affect
the
ovaries
and
uterus
ovarian
tumors
generally
consist
of
one
or
more
cysts
or
sacs
developed
within
the
ovary
and
filled
with
a
fluid
or
matter
which
is
formed
in
their
interior
the
cysts
vary
in
size
in
some
instances
being
not
larger
than
a
pea
while
in
others
they
are
capable
of
containing
many
quarts
of
fluid
in
one
case
operated
upon
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
pints
of
fluid
were
taken
from
three
cysts
the
effect
of
ovarian
tumors
on
the
duration
of
life
is
shown
by
the
statistics
of
stafford
lee
of
cases
nearly
a
third
died
within
a
year
more
than
within
two
years
from
the
first
development
of
reliable
symptoms
while
only
seventeen
lived
for
nine
years
or
upwards
fibroid
tumors
of
the
uterus
are
composed
of
fibrous
tissue
identical
in
structure
with
that
of
the
uterine
walls
they
are
met
with
in
all
sizes
from
that
of
a
small
shot
to
that
of
a
mass
capable
of
filling
the
entire
cavity
of
the
abdomen
cases
are
on
record
in
which
these
tumors
have
attained
the
weight
of
seventy
pounds
the
manner
in
which
fibroid
tumors
terminate
life
is
generally
by
prostration
and
debility
produced
by
pressure
on
and
consequently
interference
with
the
function
of
some
one
or
more
of
the
organs
essential
to
life
or
by
anæmia
and
debility
produced
by
the
severe
hemorrhages
which
the
or
form
not
infrequently
induces
polypi
or
polypoid
tumors
of
the
uterus
are
of
three
kinds
cystic
mucous
and
fibrous
they
vary
greatly
in
size
sometimes
being
as
large
as
a
and
their
point
of
attachment
may
be
extensive
or
consist
only
of
a
small
pedicle
the
cystic
and
mucous
varieties
may
spring
from
any
portion
of
the
mucous
surface
of
the
uterus
but
they
are
more
frequently
met
with
growing
from
the
mucous
membrane
lining
the
cervical
canal
and
pendent
from
the
mouth
of
the
womb
as
represented
in
fig
and
in
fig
colored
plate
iv
while
the
fibrous
variety
generally
grows
from
the
tissue
at
or
near
the
fundus
or
upper
portion
of
the
uterus
the
most
prominent
symptoms
of
polypoid
growths
are
hemorrhage
which
is
almost
invariably
present
leucorrhea
pain
backache
and
a
sense
of
weight
and
dragging
in
the
pelvis
the
best
method
of
treatment
and
in
fact
the
only
effectual
one
is
removal
with
the
polypus
forceps
or
the
operation
is
usually
attended
with
little
or
no
pain
for
more
than
years
the
physicians
of
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
have
been
successfully
treating
tumors
by
means
of
electricity
more
recently
the
medical
profession
has
quite
generally
adopted
electrical
applications
in
response
to
the
advice
of
apostoli
of
paris
the
plan
used
however
is
crude
it
does
not
compare
in
results
with
the
successful
and
safe
procedure
that
our
surgeons
have
invented
and
pursued
electrical
treatment
will
destroy
the
life
of
ovarian
and
fibroid
tumors
if
applied
early
and
after
the
improved
methods
so
long
used
at
our
institution
the
destructive
effect
of
electricity
is
modified
by
the
introduction
of
certain
applications
so
that
it
attacks
and
kills
only
the
cells
of
the
tumor
the
very
large
ovarian
tumors
however
are
not
amenable
to
treatment
by
this
process
the
walls
of
their
cysts
become
so
thin
and
weak
while
the
pressure
of
the
fluid
from
within
is
so
great
that
sudden
and
spontaneous
rupture
is
liable
to
occur
at
any
time
and
produce
death
removal
by
a
cutting
operation
is
necessary
in
such
cases
fortunately
this
procedure
as
skillfully
modified
and
perfected
by
experience
has
in
the
hands
of
our
surgeons
proven
free
from
the
dangers
and
hazard
common
to
ovariotomy
this
is
due
to
skillful
operation
and
to
the
fact
that
in
our
institution
the
sanitary
arrangements
are
as
perfect
as
it
is
possible
to
make
them
everything
is
at
hand
in
the
way
of
instruments
and
appliances
likely
to
be
required
and
the
entire
procedure
is
conducted
upon
the
principles
of
perfect
cleanliness
and
antisepsis
which
obviate
the
risk
of
inflammation
and
furthermore
our
nurses
have
had
such
fine
training
and
such
a
vast
experience
in
their
attendance
upon
such
cases
that
wants
are
anticipated
and
details
that
would
escape
those
not
so
well
qualified
are
looked
after
so
thoughtfully
and
vigilantly
that
the
convalescence
is
rapid
as
well
as
being
in
every
way
comfortable
and
safe
under
such
conditions
our
surgeons
have
completed
a
long
list
of
removals
of
ovarian
tumors
without
a
single
death
we
are
therefore
in
stating
that
the
dangers
due
to
the
presence
of
these
tumors
are
far
greater
than
the
slight
risks
of
removal
by
the
skillful
methods
employed
by
our
surgeons
owing
to
a
change
made
in
the
anæsthetic
used
the
painful
and
persistent
vomiting
that
often
follows
abdominal
operations
is
prevented
this
does
away
with
the
greatest
of
all
the
dangers
attendant
upon
the
operation
of
ovariotomy
and
favors
speedy
recovery
food
as
administered
in
the
form
of
artificially
digested
and
concentrated
nourishment
is
readily
retained
the
strength
is
thus
rapidly
restored
and
the
healing
process
hastened
it
is
generally
supposed
that
the
size
of
the
opening
made
through
the
abdominal
walls
is
large
proportionate
to
the
size
of
these
tumors
this
is
an
error
even
in
the
largest
cystic
tumors
where
the
development
is
immense
a
small
incision
only
is
made
simply
sufficient
to
bring
the
walls
of
the
tumor
in
view
and
admit
perhaps
two
or
three
fingers
the
tumor
is
then
rapidly
emptied
of
its
contents
by
means
of
a
powerful
suction
apparatus
adhesions
if
any
exist
are
then
carefully
removed
and
hemorrhage
therefrom
prevented
after
which
the
large
sac
of
the
tumor
which
when
collapsed
is
like
a
thin
bag
is
readily
drawn
out
through
the
small
opening
in
the
abdomen
and
removed
the
small
pedicle
or
mass
of
vessels
that
supplies
the
tumor
are
then
carefully
treated
after
a
plan
invented
by
and
peculiar
to
ourselves
which
effectually
prevents
any
bleeding
and
at
the
same
time
does
not
leave
any
irritating
substance
such
as
burned
and
charred
flesh
rubber
silk
or
any
other
unabsorbable
material
within
the
abdomen
the
parts
are
left
unbruised
and
without
any
poisonous
germs
in
contact
our
surgeons
have
met
with
phenomenal
success
in
removing
ovarian
tumors
by
the
operation
of
ovariotomy
thus
far
in
a
career
extending
over
a
long
period
of
time
and
embracing
the
removal
of
a
long
list
of
these
morbid
growths
they
have
not
had
a
single
fatal
case
the
following
cases
illustrate
our
method
of
treatment
in
a
few
of
the
many
cases
that
have
been
under
our
care
each

i
a

woman
aged
had
never
given
birth
to
a
child
about
four
years
before
coming
under
our
observation
she
discovered
a
small
bunch
as
she
expressed
it
in
the
left
ovarian
region
which
gradually
increased
in
size
until
when
she
consulted
us
it
caused
considerable
pain
in
the
region
of
the
liver
from
pressure
and
interfered
with
respiration
her
general
health
was
becoming
much
impaired
she
stated
that
she
had
consulted
a
prominent
gynecologist
in
this
city
who
had
told
her
that
the
attachments
of
the
tumor
were
so
extensive
that
ovariotomy
removal
with
the
knife
was
out
of
the
question
and
that
therefore
he
could
only
give
her
palliative
treatment
this
unfavorable
prognosis
only
added
mental
anguish
and
despair
to
her
physical
suffering
on
examination
we
found
a
large
multilocular
cystic
tumor
represented
by
fig
with
very
thick
walls
extending
from
the
left
ovarian
region
obliquely
upwards
and
to
the
right
so
that
it
pressed
more
upon
the
short
ribs
on
the
right
side
than
it
did
upon
the
left
but
which
filled
the
entire
cavity
of
the

the
attachments
as
the
doctor
whom
she
had
previously
consulted
had
stated
were
so
extensive
that
its
removal
with
the
knife
could
not
be
thought
of
we
were
not
disposed
however
to
give
the
case
up
as
hopeless
we
told
her
that
we
would
do
what
we
could
for
her
but
as
to
what
the
result
of
our
treatment
would
be
we
could
not
definitely
say
she
placed
her
case
in
our
hands
and
we
resorted
to
the
above
described
treatment
she
was
treated
two
and
three
times
per
week
for
more
than
two
months
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
tumor
had
decreased

ever

had
discovered
a
tumor
of
about
the
size
of
an
egg
in
the
region
of
the
left
ovary
which
had
been
gradually
increasing
in
size
on
examination
we
found
the
morbid
growth
to
be
about
the
size
of
a
quart
bowl
and
evidently
composed
of
several
cysts
with
thick
walls
she
experienced
no
pain
and
but
slight
inconvenience
from
its
presence
but
she
was
in
great
mental
distress
she
was
an
only

died
a

resulting
from
an
operation
for
the
removal
of
a
large
ovarian
tumor
performed
by

i

the

rendered
the

verdict
how
that

for

a

ever
expected
to
see
me
again
alive

with
a

relieve
me
of
every
care
on
the

we
started
for

was

the

who
received
me
or
the
gentle

who
tried
so
patiently

kindly
to
minister
to
my

i
had
read
a
good
deal
about
the

hotel
and
expected
to
see
wonderful
things
but
like
sheba
queen
i
could
truthfully
say
half
had
never
been
told
the
many
ways
means
and
appliances
for
the
relief
of
poor
sufferers
surpassed
a
thousand
fold
anything
i
had
ever
imagined
could
come
within
the
scope
of
human
skill
the
skilled
physicians
were
not
only
able
and
attentive
but
on
meeting
one
if
it
were
every
day
they
always
had
a
ready
smile
a
warm
hand
clasp
and
an
encouraging
word
which
alone
would
make
one
feel
better
and
at
home
the
trained
nurses
were
attentive
and
kind
every
department
was
cleanliness
itself
and
kept
at
such
an
even
temperature
even
to
the
halls
that
during
my
four
months
stay
i
never
had
the
slightest
cold
not
only
the
comforts
of
life
but
every
luxury
that
the
most
exacting
could
demand
were
fully
supplied
i
saw
many
poor
sufferers
from
various
diseases
made
well
and
happy
and
i
too
with
the
other
happy
ones
found
relief
and
that
without
the
use
of
the
knife
or
an
anæsthetic
of
any
kind
i
would
urge
all
poor
chronic
sufferers
it
matters
not
what
the
trouble
may
be
to
go
to
institute
and
be
cured
if
any
one
similarly
afflicted
cares
to
know
more
of
my
case

me

the

had
gradually
developed

the

induced

the
womb
and
leucorrhoea
or
whites
previous
to
taking
your
medicines
i
took
six
bottles
of
your
favorite
prescription
and
was
entirely
cured
of
both
in
six
months
it
is
four
years
this
month
since
i
was
entirely
well
of
both
those
diseases
and
have
never
had
any
signs
of
their
appearance
since
and
i
am
satisfied
the
favorite
prescription
saved
my
life
for
i
could
hardly
walk
around
when
i
commenced
taking
your
medicine
and
i
think
it
is
a
god
blessing
to
me
and
a
great
credit
to
you
that
i
ever
took
your
medicine
for
had
i
not
taken
it
i
think
i
would
have
been
in
the
grave
now
and
i
can
highly
recommend
it
to
all
who
suffer
from
these
two
complaints
i
was
pronounced
incurable
by
the
best
doctors
here
in
the
west
i
gave
up
all
hopes
and
made
up
my
mind
that
i
was
to
be
taken
away
from
my
husband
and
baby
of
two
years
old
i
was
sick
all
of
the
time
could
not
eat
anything
at
all
in
one
week
after
beginning
the
use
of
your
medicine
my
stomach
was
so
much
better
that
i
could
eat
anything
i
could
see
that
i
was
gaining
all
over
and
my
husband
then
went
and
got
me
six
bottles
i
took
three
of
them
and
my
stomach
did
not
bother
me
any
more
we
sent
to
you
and
got
the
people
common
sense
medical
adviser
and
found
my
case
described
just
as
i
was
we
did
what
the
book
told
us
in
every
way
in
one
month
time
i
could
see
i
was
much
better
than
i
had
been
we
still
kept
on
just
as
the
book
told
us
and
in
three
months
i
stopped
taking
medicine
only
three
times
a
day
and
continued
for
some
time
in
that
way
and
i
can
proudly
say
i
am
a
well
woman
yes
am
well
strong
and
healthy
i
am
so
glad
and
thankful
to
you

for
my
good
health
for
well
do
i
know
you
are
the
one
that
cured
me
when
i
began
to
take
your
medicine
my
face
was
poor
and
eyes
looked
dead
i
could
not
enjoy
myself
any
where
i
was
tired
and
sick
all
the
time
i
could
hardly
do
my
housework
but
now
i

that

about
eighteen
years
ago
after
the
birth
of
one
of
my
children
i
was
left
in
a
weak
condition
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
nerves
were
unstrung
very
bad
i
did
not
suffer
much
pain
but
i
think
i
suffered
everything
any
one
could
suffer
with
nervousness
my
life
was
a
misery
to
me
i
doctored
with
seven
different
doctors
and
got
no
relief
then
i
took
almost
all
kinds
of
patent
medicines
and
got
no
relief
from
them
but
got
worse
all
the
time
when
i
chanced
to
get
one
of
your
little
pamphlets
i
thought
i
would
write
to
you
and
waited
as
i
thought
to
hear
that
there
was
no
help
for
me
when
my
answer
came
and
you
said
you
could
cure
me
great
was
my
joy
i
had
taken
your
medicine
about
a
month
when
i
began
to
improve
and
in
a
few
months
was
entirely
cured
my
recovery
was
like
coming
out
of
the
dark
into
the
light
so
great
was
the
change
i
will
advise
all
sufferers
to
go
to
you
for
relief
i
think
they
will
be
disappointed
when
i
commenced
taking
your

weighed
pounds

mrs
moody
a
grateful
heart
and
an
appreciation
of
your
medical
skill
prompts
me
to
make
a
statement
of
my
case
at
the
birth
of
my
last
baby
a
boy
weighing
pounds
at
his
birth
i
contracted
womb
disease
and
for
three
years
previous
to
treatment
i
had
been
a
great
sufferer
from
prolapsus
owing
to
a
more
serious
injury
than
prolapsus
received
at
childbirth
my
physicians
told
me
that
i
could
never
hope
for
recovery
after
delivery
i
kept
my
bed
for
seven
weeks
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
i
tried
to
walk
i
found
that
i
could
not
even
stand
straight
there
seemed
to
be
a
tight
cord
or
drawing
from
my
left
side
extending
down
into
my
groin
accompanied
by
great
soreness
after
repeated
attempts
with
my
body
inclined
to
that
side
and
yielding
to
the
drawing
i
finally
succeeded
in
walking
a
violent
trembling
all
the
while
in
the
parts
affected
three
months
after
the
birth
of
my
baby
i
tried
to
take
hold
of
my
household
duties
then
my
troubles
increased
and
with
them
came
a
series
of
doctors
bills
i
consulted
two
of
the
best
physicians
besides
trying
all
the
medicines
i
heard
tell
of
that
were
recommended
for
such
diseases
but
failed
in
obtaining
a
cure
from
any
of
them
my
relief
was
only
temporary
my
condition
was
growing
worse
each
day
the
womb
was
so
low
and
the
bearing
down
weight
so
great
that
i
could
scarcely
stand
on
my
feet
at
all
i
was
irritable
and
nervous
with
a
dull
headache
and
constipation
hands
and
feet
cold
and
clammy
except
the
palms
and
soles
a
burning
on
top
of
my
head
at
this
stage
of
my
disease
my
bladder
was
badly
affected
the
neck
becoming
enlarged
and
the
water
collecting
there
caused
a
protrusion
to
over
half
the
size
of
a
tea
cup
leaving
it
so
dry
and
harsh
that
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
i
could
walk
at
all
a
sudden
jar
sneeze
or
even
the
slightest
pressure
would
force
the
water
out
leaving
me
in
a
spasm
of
pain
at
this
stage
months
after
confinement
menstruation
returned
for
the
first
time
since
the
birth
of
my
baby
i
had
already
suffered
as
much
as
i
thought
it
possible
to
bear
and
live
but
my
sufferings
were
even
greater
after
this
my
womb
was
ulcerated
and
inflamed
nervousness
increased
to
violent
shaking
over
which
i
had
no
control
circulation
so
feeble
that
the
extremities
were
scarcely
supplied
with
blood
they
were
constantly
cold
and
clammy
my
sleep
broken
and
disturbed
life
was
fast
becoming
a
burden
to
me
for
months
however
i
endured
this
torture
i
had
abandoned
work
altogether
i
could
be
up
but
a
few
moments
at
a
time
and
could
not
walk
across
the
floor
without
excruciating
pain
there
was
no
sleep
no
rest
and
after
a
week
and
even
more
would
pass
during
which
i
would
never
close
my
eyes
in
sleep
even
when
morphine
opium
and
chloral
were
administered
my
body
seemed
a
dead
weight
while
my
mind
was
alive
to
all
my
sufferings
there
seemed
to
be
a
burning
pressure
about
my
head
all
the
while
i
would
have
shaking
spells
frequently
leaving
me
perfectly
exhausted
my
heart
the
while
beating
so
rapidly
i
could
not
count
the
pulsations
it
seemed
to
cease
altogether
after
that
with
a
sinking
fainting
feeling
over
me
making
it
difficult
to
breathe
at
all
during
my
menstrual
periods
i
suffered
a
thousand
deaths
my
appetite
was
gone
mind
and
sight
impaired
strength
and
flesh
all
gone
i
was
a
pitiable
object
to
look
at
divested
of
all
that
made
life
endurable
for
me
i
had
baffled
the
skill
of
two
physicians
and
was
left
after
three
years
of
agony
to
die
a
hopeless
wreck
worse
than
death
such
was
my
condition
when
i
applied
to
you
for
treatment
after
using
medicines
only
six
days
i
began
to
improve
my
nerves
were
steadier
circulation
better
hands
and
feet
warm
nine
days
after
taking
your
medicines
they
restored
the
function
again
i
will
confess
i
expected
to
suffer
death
again
i
did
not
think
the
medicines
had
had
time
to
effect
a
change
within
so
short
a
time
imagine
my
joy
and
surprise
upon
waking
next
morning
to
find
it
had
stolen
like
a
thief
upon
me
in
the
night
i
knew
not
when
i
spent
the
day
in
grateful
tears
how
could
i
help
it
it
passed
off
as
quietly
as
it
came
leaving
my
head
clear
of
that
burning
my
nerves
were
steady
indeed
my
improvement
was
so
remarkable
that
it
seemed
almost
a
delusion
my
appetite
had
returned
and
i
was
hungry
for
the
first
time
in
over
a
year
i
slept
well
awoke
refreshed
and
feeling
stronger
after
two
weeks
i
was
able
to
walk
around
the
house
and
yard
without
support
a
day
or
two
after
that
i
walked
a
hundred
yards
visiting
and
spent
the
day
in
three
weeks
time
i
went
home
i
had
gone
to
my
mother
before
treatment
as
i
and
many
others
thought
to
die
at
the
end
of
one
month
there
was
no
symptom
nor
sign
of
the
old
disease
i
was
able
to
be
up
all
day
resting
a
short
time
at
noon
to
be
sure
of
permanent
results
i
continued
treatment
for
one
month
longer
and
have
never
had
a
return
of
the
disease
nor
any
symptom
of
it
since
before
the
end
of
the
second
month
i
was
able
to
be
about
the
house
helping
the
children
with
the
cooking
and
milking
my
weight
increased
fourteen
pounds
in

years

consulted
your

my

at

become
very
much
impaired
from
the
effects
of
uterine
disease
indigestion
and
chronic

i
was
also
troubled
with
frequent
attacks
of

which
rendered
me
very
miserable
a
line
of
treatment
was
outlined
by
your
specialist
which
i
followed
closely
and
i
immediately
began
to
improve
under
the
use
of
the
medicine
advised
the
benefits
were
so
marked
that
within
two
or
three
months
i
was
able
to
discontinue
the
use
of
the
medicine
and
have
since
that
time
been
enjoying
good

i
attribute
my
cure
to
the

received

which
did
so
much
for
her
that
after
i
was
married
i
used
them
in

two

times
i
have
used
the
discovery
when
physicians
told
me
they
could
only
patch
me
up
i
was
so
bad
and
getting
steadily
worse
i
sat
down
and
wrote
to
you
even
after
the
letter
was
written
i
felt
so
worthless
it
seemed
foolish
to
try
so
kept
my
letter
for
some
time
thinking
it
better
not
to
trouble
you
with
it
but
finally
mailed
it
little
thinking
your
advice
and
the
discovery
could
so
speedily
restore
me
to
my
usual
health
a
near
neighbor
used
it
for
a
cough
occasioned
by
a
sudden
cold
and
less
than
one
bottle
stopped
the
cough
we
use
the
pellets
for

the
numberless
ills
and
epidemics
that
go
the
rounds
always
with
happy
results
it
saves
us
physicians
bills
and
much
suffering
we
consult
your
common

as
our

physician
it
saves
much
anxiety
and
fruitless
journeyings
after
a
physician
perhaps
to
find

gone

unwilling
to
breast

to

consulted

and
consulted

me
no

in

in

of

at

i
paid
but
little
attention
to
it
hoping
it
would
amount
to
nothing
and
probably
wear
away
but
i
slowly
but
surely
grew
worse
and
at
last
resolved
to
apply
to
the
doctors
for
help
my
water
came
often
and
in
small
quantities
and
with
great
pain
and
with

i
was
attacked
with
severe
womb
trouble
bloody
piles
and
dropsy
of
the
ovary
i
was
treated
by
five
different
doctors
i
was
compelled
to
wear
an
inside
support
for
a
year
but
it
still
seemed
impossible
for
me
to
get
well
and
i
began
to
feel
exceedingly
alarmed
and
very
uneasy
not
knowing
what
course
to
pursue
or
what
the
consequences
might
be
i
had
heard
of
pierce
and
concluded
to
make
one
more
trial
so
i
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
him
stating
matters
as
near
as
i
could
and
in
due
time
i
received
a
favorable
reply
then
i
commenced
with
his

commenced
somewhere
in

with
the
golden

in
alternate
doses
a
strange
occurrence
followed
my
limbs
felt
like
what

call
asleep
and
i
felt
as
if
i
were
in
a
strange
land
and
wondered
what
was
going
to
take
place
i
kept
on
till
i
took
nine
bottles
the
first
relief
i
felt
was
from
sick
headache
which
i
had
been
troubled
with
for
many
years
i
was
also
cured
of
a
very
bad
cough
which
i
had
been
troubled
with
for
many
years
and
of
dyspepsia
of
long
standing
i
was
entirely
cured
of
a
very
singular
and
severe
itching
on
my
back
between
my
shoulders
which
our
doctors
called
winter
itch
and
which
they
pronounced
incurable
i
had
suffered
with
this
for
twenty
years
it
would
come
in
the
winter
and
go
away
in
the
summer
i
was
also
cured
of
the
worst
form
of
bloody
piles
and
of

me
a

i
was
sick

nearly
three

sometimes
i
thought
i

go
crazy
i
was
so
weak
nervous
and
down
hearted
and
sour
in
spirits
that
i
was
afraid
i
would
die
every
day
and
such
mean
feelings
i
could
not
describe
to
any
one
i
remained
in
this
stage
for
nearly
three
years
doctoring
with
every
home
doctor
and
trying
every
medicine
that
i
thought
would
help
me
and
i
could
get
no
relief
i
could
not
sleep
at

and
had
palpitation
of
the
heart
so
that
i
would
have
to
get
up

would
beat
so
fast

i
commenced

spring
and
took
three
bottles
of

i
felt
so
much
better
i
thought
that
was
enough
and
ever
since

have
had
my
health
i
grew
stronger
and
could
run
and
skip
about
like
a

and
was
happy
all
day
long
i
felt
so
well
i
could
hardly
believe
it
was
myself
i
just
used
the
two
kinds
of
medicines
golden
medical
discovery
and
favorite
prescription
and
followed
the
common
sense
medical
adviser
took
regular
baths
and
dieted
for
about
a
year
and
the
result
was
a
bright
baby
boy
which
brightens
our
home
i
took
the
favorite

before
and
the
result
was
a
few

it
is
now
about
five
years
since
i
spent
eight
days
at

institute
under
treatment
for
a
chronic
disease
of
eighteen
years
standing
i
had
given
up
to
die
going
to
your
dispensary
was
a
last
resort
with
me
i
had
undergone
a
surgical
operation
at
the
hands
of
my
family
physician
from
which
i
grew
worse
every
day
for
eight
months
so
that
i
very
despondently
started
for
your
institution
and
when
i
had
traveled
eleven
hundred
miles
i
was
made
more
despondent
by
inquiring
of
a
man
how
far
i
had
to
travel
to
reach
buffalo
he
answered
just
one
hundred
miles
i
then
inquired
of
him
if
he
had
ever
been
in
buffalo
he
replied
many
a
time
i
then
asked
him
what
about
pierce

oh
it
a
humbug
they
have
some
drawings
or
pictures
taken
from
some
government
buildings
that
where
they
get
that
fine
building
you
see
pictured
in
their
books

i
do
suppose
there
ever
was
a
sadder
heart
entered
the
door
of
the

than
that
heart
of
mine
but
it
was
soon
made
glad
to
be
glad
ever
since
during
the
first
night
in
the
invalids
hotel
i
met
and
talked
with
patients
afflicted
as
i
was
many
of
them
were
cured
and
talking
of
going
home
next
day
and
sure
enough
they
went
but
i
never
missed
them
in
number
for
others
kept
coming
i
can
honestly
and
truthfully
say
that
the
world

anything
else

the
reason
why

physician
he
said
i
had

gave
me
medicine
two
or
three
months
but
i
kept
getting
weaker
all
the
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
diseased
all
over
thought
i
had

had
the
doctor
examine
my
heart
several
times
i
became
so
discouraged
that
i
gave
up
all
hope
of
ever
getting
well
but
consented
to
send
to
pierce
for
medicine
i
commenced
taking
it
and
in
a
short
time
i
was
able
to
sit
up
continued
to
take
his
medicine
three
months
and
felt
like

spermatorrhea
seminal
weakness
or
emission
of
semen
without
copulation
is
generally
induced
by
the
early
habit
of
masturbation
it
is
one
of
the
evidences
that
passion
instead
of
prudence
has
held
sway
passion
may
aptly
be
termed
the
voice
of
the
body
by
which
if
we
listen
we
are
enchanted
and
led
astray
conscience
is
the
voice
of
the
soul
which
remonstrates
and
if
we
obey
we
shall
be
guided
aright
we
can
not
reconcile
these
conflicting
voices
and
if
we
indulge
the
passions
when
conscience
forbids
gratification
the
remembrance
of
the
wrong
remains
forever
and
constant
fear
is
an
everlasting
punishment

a

and
is
intermixed
with

the

its

is
a
wanton
expenditure
which
robs
the
blood
of
its

and
exhausts
the

no

that

enfeebles
the

results
in

premature

intemperate

not

prevents

but
ultimately
if
persisted
in
renders
the

entirely
impotent

destroys
the

of

spermatorrhea
may
be
induced
by
spinal
irritation
intestinal

it
may
also
result
from
inherited
as

as
acquired
constitutional
weakness
nocturnal
or
night
emissions
involuntary
emissions
of
semen
most
frequently
occur
during
amorous
dreams
at
night
and
are
therefore
termed
although
they
are
at
first
occasioned
by
lascivious
dreams
attended
by
erections
and
pleasurable
sensations
yet
as
the
disease
progresses
the
erections
become
less
perfect
and
the
losses
are
only
revealed
by
the
depression
of
spirits
experienced
the
following
morning
and
by
the
stiffened
and
stained
spots
on
the
linen
at
first
these
emissions
may
occur
but
once
in
two
or
three
weeks
unless
the
patient
be
excited
by
company
stimulation
food
drinks
or
other
causes
but
at
a
later
stage
of
the
disease
they
sometimes
take
place
every
night
in
aggravated
cases
the
seminal
sacs
are
so
weakened
that
the
warmth
of
the
bed
friction
of
the
clothing
reading
obscene
literature
viewing
indecent
pictures
indulging
in
lewd
conversation
or
even
being
in
the
presence
of
women
produces
a
waste
of
semen
many
times
unattended
by
erections
when
there
is
great
weakness
seminal
discharges
may
be
induced
by
lifting
heavy
weights
pressure
upon
the
genital
organs
horseback
riding
straining
at

or
even
upon
urinating
as
observed
when

which
appear
thick
and
viscid
if
the
urine
be
allowed
to
stand
for
a
few
hours
the

will
be
precipitated
and
will
form
a

of
the
celebrated
drewery
of
london
speaking
of
the
reason
why
masturbation
is
so
extremely
injurious
in
its
effects
upon
both
body
and
mind
says
this
is
a
question
which
i
have
often
been
asked
by
patients
and
it
is
one
which
is
rather
difficult
to
explain
to
any
one
not
acquainted
with
the
phenomena
of
reflex
nervous
action
perhaps
the
simplest
mode
of
putting
it
is
to
say
that
the
effects
produced
by
the
excitement
of
the
parts
are
not
the
direct
result
of
the
stimulation
but
that
the
excitement
of
the
extremities
of
the
nerves
is
conveyed
through
them
to
the
spinal
cord
and
brain
and
that
the
emission
which
occurs
when
sufficient
stimulus
has
been
applied
is
the
result
of
nervous
force
reacting
upon
the
parts
from
the
spinal
cord
back
again
this
action
is
termed
reflex
and
is
similar
to
that
of
vomiting
which
is
only
produced
through
the
medium
of
the
great
nervous
centres
so
that
if
the
nervous
communication
between
the
stomach
and
spinal
cord
and
brain
is
cut
off
nothing
in
the
stomach
could
possibly
cause
vomiting
whereas
if
the
communication
remains
intact
this
action
can
be
immediately
produced
by
irritation
of
nerves
far
away
from
the
stomach
by
tickling
the
fauces
as
every
drunkard
is
well
aware
who
has
ever
put
his
finger
down
his
throat
for
the
purpose
of
emptying
his
stomach
of
the
contents
which
are
poisoning
him
but
which
without
the
additional
stimulus
he
is
unable
to
expel
it
will
be
seen
therefore
from
this
that
the
act
of
emission
is
only
produced
through
the
agency
of
the
spinal
cord
and
not
by
any
direct
nervous
action
between
the
parts
which
are
stimulated
and
those
which
are
concerned
in
the
emission
illustration
fig
the
testicle
in
a
healthy
condition
illustration
fig
a
testicle
wasted
by
masturbation
the
brain
is
also
concerned
to
the
fullest
extent
in
the
production
of
these
phenomena
as
are
all
the
senses
of
the
body
this
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
emissions
occur
during
sleep
without
any
excitement
beyond
the
engorgement
of
the
parts
with
blood
produced
by
the
cerebellar
congestion
of
the
brain
usually
found
to
follow
lying
upon
the
back
during
sleep
this
however
is
unnatural
and
unhealthy
and
is
usually
the
result
as
before
pointed
out
of
masturbation
but
these
two
important
points
must
be
remembered
that
emission
may
be
produced
by
friction
merely
as
a
purely
spinal
reflex
action
and
it
may
be
caused
by
the
action
of
the
brain
without
any
friction
whatever
both
these
results
are
unhealthy
and
injurious
a
true
natural
and
healthy
act
of
sexual
intercourse
demands
the
excitement
of
brain
spinal
cord
and
every
nerve
in
the
body
simultaneously
and
resembles
the
lightning
flash
which
restores
the
equilibrium
of
electric
force
disturbed
during
a
thunderstorm
it
is
useless
to
endeavor
to
describe
the
marvelous
actions
of
nervous
force
but
from
what
has
been
said
it
is
not
difficult
to
comprehend
that
if
a
convulsive
action
is
produced
in
any
part
of
the
body
by
the
sole
excitement
of
the
spinal
cord
when
it
is
necessary
for
its
healthy
and
natural
production
that
the
brain
and
senses
generally
should
be
equally
excited
the
balance
of
nerve
power
is
destroyed
which
fact
alone
is
proved
by
the
effects
upon
the
nervous
system
always
following
masturbation
which
is
the
irritation
of
the
spinal
cord
without
the
assistance
of
the
brain
various
complications
are
likely
to
arise
in
the
progress
of
this
malady
stricture
of
the
urethra
or
water
passage
is
a
very
common
complication
and
even
when
quite
slight
generally
interferes
very
seriously
with
the
cure
of
the
spermatorrhea
when
overlooked
by
the
attending
physician
as
is
very
commonly
done
especially
when
the
constriction
of
the
water
passage
is
only
slight
very
often
it
occurs
in
our
practice
that
on
examining
a
case
of
this
disease
that
has
been
the
rounds
of
the
doctors
we
find
a
stricture
which
had
been
entirely
overlooked
by
other
practitioners
being
so
slight
as
not
to
occasion
serious
obstruction
to
the
flow
of
urine
but
yet
sufficient
to
interfere
very
much
with
the
cure
of
the
spermatorrhea
the
size
of
the
urethra
or
water
passage
should
bear
an
exact
and
proportionate
relation
to
that
of
the
penis
and
when
from
any
cause
the
urethra
is
contracted
below
this
normal
size
it
should
receive
attention
as
otherwise
the
stricture
is
likely
to
increase
and
the
passage
becomes
so
constricted
as
to
produce
serious
disease
of
the
bladder
and
not
fail
to
perpetuate
spermatorrhea
when
this
disease
exists
hydrocele
of
the

of
an
undue
secretion
of
the
fluid
which
moistens
the
and
may
arise
from
an
irritation
of
the
testicle
produced
by
masturbation
this
subject
is
fully
considered
in
the
medical
adviser
varicocele
is
a
dilatation
of
the
veins
of
the
spermatic
cord
and
scrotum
and
is
frequently
a
result
of
masturbation
it
is
readily
distinguished
under
the
form
of
a
soft
doughy
compressible
knotty
and
unequal
enlargement
of
the
veins
and
a
tumid
condition
of
the
adjacent
parts
one
writer
speaking
of
the
enlargement
of
the
spermatic
vessels
describes
them
as
feeling
like
a
coiled
up
bundle
of
worms
disease
of
the
prostate
gland
is
frequently
caused
by
solitary
indulgence
venereal
excesses
produce
congestion
and
the
gland
is
overnourished
it
becomes
greatly
enlarged
a
condition
called
this
affection
gives
rise
to
a
heavy
feeling
or
pressure
in
the
region
below
the
bladder
and
often
interferes
seriously
with
urination
and
gives
great
pain
and
uneasiness
and
often
results
in
grave
and
dangerous
complications
prostatorrhea
consists
of
an
unnatural
flowing
or
wasting
of
the
prostatic
secretion
which
may
be
known
by
its
appearance
and
when
placed
within
the
field
of
the
microscope
by
the
absence
of
or
fecundating
germs
it
is
often
mistaken
for
spermatorrhea
or
for
gleet
by
inexperienced
and
careless
physicians
for
a
full
consideration
of
diseases
of
the
prostate
gland

the
habit
of
weakens
all
the
structures
of
the
genital
organs
and
induces
seminal
waste
which
may
lead
to
a
morbid
diminution
in
the
size
of
the
prostate
gland
this
condition
which
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
the
one
above
described
is
any
disease
which
renders
the
circulation
in
the
prostate
gland
languid
and
feeble
interferes
with
the
nutrition
of
that
organ
and
impairs
its
function
impotency
of
sexual
masturbation
prevents
the
excitability
of
the
nervous
system
and
sexual
organs
and
causes
debility
which
is
indicated
by
the
premature
discharge
of
semen
during
sexual
intercourse
these
premature
emissions
indicate
not
only
partial
impotency
but
also
that
the
have
become
morbidly
sensitive
by
the
practice
of
solitary
vice
or
marital
excesses
at
length
the
powers
of
the
erectile
tissues
are
diminished
and
there
is
weakness
which
prevents
the
act
of
copulation
or
the
erection
may
be
slow
and
not
last
long
enough
on
account
of
a
faulty
functional
condition
of
the
spinal
cord
a
peculiar
form
of
impotency
is
associated
with
certain
abnormal
nutritive
changes
which
give
rise
to
a
lymphatic
or
fat
condition
of
the
system
not
that
the
temperament
in
all
these
cases
is
originally
lymphatic
but
the
system
degenerates
in
consequence
of
nutritive
perversion
with
the
loss
of
sexual
ardor
there
is
also
apathy
of
mind
loss
of
manliness
and
the
victim
becomes
cold
dispassionate
and
treacherous
devoid
of
any
admiration
or
love
for
the
opposite
sex
he
acquires
rotundity
of
person
the
face
is
fat
smooth
often
beardless
and
the
voice
is
feminine
the
victims
of
this
disease
represent
two
distinct
classes
viz
those
who
are
fearfully
tormented
by
the
consciousness
that
they
are
losing
their
virile
powers
and
become
irritable
jealous
and
often
desperate
and
those
who
are
completely
indifferent
to
this
deprivation
patients
of
the
former
class
are
readily
restored
to
health
by
proper
treatment
for
they
are
willing
to
make
an
effort
for
the
recovery
of
their
manly
powers
there
is
not
complete
loss
of
sexual
desire
yet
their
disappointment
is
so
great
that
they
may
entertain
suicidal
thoughts
they
are
moody
fickle
discontented
excitable
and
remarkably
impulsive
with
proper
treatment
they
regain
tone
of
body
vigor
of
mind
an
increase
of
sexual
desire
and
become
more
attentive
to
business
affairs
and
less
indifferent
to
the
gentler
sex
with
the
restoration
of
the
general
health
and
the
sexual
functions
remarkable
constitutional
changes
occur
it
is
often
the
case
that
their
intimate
friends
hardly
recognize
them
by
looks
or
acts
it
is
equally
true
that
those
who
are
wholly
indifferent
to
the
loss
of
virile
power
uninterested
in
the
evidences
of
their
manhood
are
sometimes

paralysis
or
palsy
when
occurring
as
a
complication

may
be
preceded
by
an
attack
of
apoplexy
in
which
the
patient
loses
consciousness
and
lays
in
a
condition
of
profound
stupor
for
a
time
and
on
recovery
from
his
unconscious
state
finds
himself
unable
to

frequent

conditions

the
records
of
the
many
institutions
for
the
unfortunate
class
of
sufferers
from
this
disease
bear
abundant
witness
sometimes
it
manifests
itself
in
the
milder
forms
of
hallucination
or
monomania
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
the
patient
sinks
into
a
despondent
hypochondria
which
is
many
times
followed
sooner
or
later
by
a
raving
mania
in
cases
of
monomania
resulting
from
masturbation
the
mental
derangement
is
often
so
slight
as
to
escape
detection
by
the
friends

peculiar
freaks

disposition
being
regarded
rather
as
eccentricities
of
character
than
as
symptoms

usually
common
with
such
sufferers

various

in
character

degree
as
not
to
admit
of
any
classification

case
presenting
phases
peculiar
to
itself
in
many
cases

imagines
that
his
best

are
conspiring
to
injure
him
or
that
some
great
calamity
is
about
to
befall
him
in
most
cases
there
is
danger
of
the
patient
committing
suicide
if
not
closely
watched

this
true
of
those
who
suffer
from

to
whether
such

upon
their

as

whether
they
are
the
result
of
a
weakness
of

organs
and
are
followed
by
more

depression

are
merely
the
overflow
of

system

ungratified
passions

when
only
occurring
at
long
intervals
the
emissions
are
not
followed
by
any
perceptible
enervating
or
weakening
effects
quackery
rampant
this
country
is
flooded
with
cheap
circulars
and
pamphlets
circulated
openly
and
broadcast
wherein
ignorant
pretentious
blatant
quacks
endeavor
to
frighten
young
men
who
may
never
have
practiced
or
been
guilty
of
excesses
in
any
way
and
yet
who
experience
now
and
then
at
long
intervals
nocturnal
seminal
emissions
in
such
cases
it
is
the
duty
of
the
conscientious
honest
and
sympathetic
practitioner
of
the
healing
art
to
give
assurance
and
not
to
unnecessarily
alarm
those
who
experience
nothing
inconsistent
with
a
state
of
fairly
good
health
to
frighten
such
young
men
into
believing
themselves
diseased
when
in
reality
they
experience
nothing
but
what
may
occasionally
occur
in
the
experiences
of
any
robust
healthy
man
is
the
most
detestable
downright
quackery
treating
the
wrong
disease
not
only
are
many
men
subjected
to
useless
treatment
by
general
practitioners
who
overlook
the
real
disease
caused
by
pernicious
youthful
habits
pursued
in
solitude
or
later
excesses
in
venery
but
the
female
sex
are
also
quite
as
often
subjected
to
treatment
for
diseases
which
do
not
exist
the
real
trouble
being
nervous
debility
and
other
weaknesses
that
have
resulted
from
the
youthful
pernicious
practices
common
to
both
sexes
or
later
excesses
in
marital
pleasures
moral
considerations
masturbation
is
a
habit
which
tyrannizes
over
the
mind
perverts
the
imagination
and
forces
upon
the
victim
venereal
desires
even
while
he
is
forming
the
strongest
resolutions
to
reform
it
constrains
into
its
service
the
higher
faculties
such
as
friendship
confidence
love
reason
and
imagination
to
make
its
ideal
graceful
and
beautiful
sensual
lust
the
fancy
creates
an
attractive
partner
possessed
of
girlish
beauty
a
perfect
type
of
goodness
blended
with
sexuality
and
whom
the
subject
worships
with
all
the
ardor
of
passion
around
this
all
his
affections
are
clustered
to
her
the
purest
of
his
blood
is
offered
in
sacrifice
and
it
is
no
wonder
that
female
associates
seem
tame
and
unattractive
when
such
imaginary
and
consummate
divinity
is
courted
in
the
sensual
delirium
is
conceived
an
elysium
of
carnal
bliss
where
nymphs
display
their
charms
and
invite
to
sensual
enjoyments
thus
we
see
how
this
habit
makes
the
spiritual
faculties
subservient
to
morbid
passion
and
by
what
means
elevating
influences
are
prostituted
to
vulgar
and
creations
symptoms
vary
in
different
cases
we
can
only
partially
delineate
the
terrible
effects
resulting
from
the
abuse
of
the
sexual
organs
the
symptoms
are
multitudinous
but
as
we
have
before
stated
no
two
persons
are
similarly
influenced
by
this
disease
the
symptoms
will
vary
according
to
the
severity
of
the
affection
the
age
of
the
patient
and
his
constitutional
peculiarities
the
presence
of
only
a
few
of
the
symptoms
which
we
have
enumerated
is
evidence
of
abnormal
weakness
which
demands
treatment
montaigne
says
we
must
see
and
get
acquainted
with
our
sins
if
we
expect
to
correct
them
virtue
presupposes
trials
just
as
much
as
victory
implies
warfare
the
triumph
of
virtue
is
to
defeat
morbid
or
excessive
passion
for
virtue
is
only
realized
when
it
is
a
conquering
force
innocence
is
passive
but
virtue
is
an
active
quality
purified
in
the
fiery
furnace
of
temptation
as
men
have
in
all
ages
been
influenced
by
passions
so
temptation
has
ever
found
its
victims
it
is
an
obligation
that
one
owes
to
himself
to
overcome
every
evil
passion
or
weakness
to
which
he
is
subject
and
the
discharge
of
this
personal
duty
requires
moral
courage
the
reward
of
virtue
our
saviour
invited
all
erring
mortals
to
enter
upon
a
higher
life
when
he
said
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labor
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
the
invitation
is
accompanied
with
a
promise
to
all
who
are
weary
of
excess
and
bowed
down
by
passion
rest
and
restoration
are
promised
if
they
will
but
reform
and
employ
proper
means
to
that
end
the
sufferers
must
reform
just
as
there
is
no
spiritual
restoration
without
obeying
the
saviour
so
there
can
be
no
physical
restoration
unless
we
fulfill
nature
imposed
conditions
there
can
be
no
salvation
unless
sin
be
discarded
and
so
there
can
be
no
redemption
from
the
bad
effects
of
a
practice
so
long
as
it
is
continued
it
is
no
easy
task
to
master
a
despotic
passion
appetite
is
often
stronger
than
the
will
the
treatment
must
begin
with
moral
reformation
every
manly
impulse
and
all
the
higher
qualities
of
the
patient
nature
must
be
enlisted
in
the
struggle
for
virtue
and
health
if
the
passions
are
restrained
then
the
capital
of
health
increases
for
the
saving
of
the
vital
secretions
is
equal
to
compound
interest
this
illustrates
the
truth
of
the
latin
proverb
gain
is
so
certain
as
that
which
proceeds
from
the
economical
use
of
what
you
have
the
patient
actually
acquires
confidence
and
manly
courage
by
the
retention
of
the
seminal
fluid
which
directly
increases
his
virile
powers
hygienic
advice
to
patients
daily
physical
exercise
and
regular
habits
must
be
established
it
is
important
that
the
mind
as
well
as
the
physical
powers
be
directed
into
active
and
wholesome
channels
there
must
be
restraint
and
discipline
it
is
useless
to
begin
medical
treatment
while
the
patient
continues
to
read
exciting
amorous
stories
and
obscene
books
which
are
suggestive
of
lewd
thoughts
something
practical
ought
to
occupy
the
thoughts
and
engage
the
hands
regular
and
vigorous
physical
exercise
is
necessary
to
assist
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
compel
its
determination
into
the
minute
and
extreme
parts
of
the
vascular
system
when
the
blood
is
thus
directed
nutrition
is
more
vigorous
and
the
activity
of
all
the
functions
is
augmented
not
only
should
there
be
regularity
in
eating
but
sound
discretion
should
be
exercised
in
selecting
a
plain
wholesome
diet
consisting
of
such
articles
of
food
as
best
favor
a
daily
and
free
evacuation
of
the
bowels
avoid
the
use
of
those
articles
of
food
which
produce
excessive
acidity
of
the
stomach
hearty
or
late
suppers
are
not
allowable
the
patient
should
use
no
alcoholic
beverages
and
should
abstain
from
such
stimulants
as
tea
coffee
beer
wine
and
tobacco
we
can
not
even
recommend
their
use
for
total
abstinence
is
the
better
plan
the
patient
should
sleep
in
a
room
on
a
hard
bed
and
have
only
sufficient
covering
for
warmth
and
comfort
he
should
not
lie
upon
the
back
because
in
this
position
nightly
emissions
are
more
likely
to
occur
the
patient
should
go
to
bed
when
he
feels
sleepy
and
not
resist
the
inclination
until
wakefulness
is
induced
he
should
rise
early
in
the
morning
and
immediately
take
a
cold
hand
bath
for
this
purpose
a
quart
or
two
of
water

hand
towel
only
are
required
after

continue
the
friction
until
the
skin
is
red
and
a
reaction
is
established
do
not
excuse
yourself
from
following
these
hygienic
suggestions
a
refreshing
bath
changes
the
morbid
sensibilities
to
a
more
healthful
state
by
the
reaction
of
the

it
is
beneficial
to
apply
a
towel
saturated
with
cold
water
to
the
genital
organs
fifteen
minutes
before
leaving
the
bed
douching
or
showering
the
genital
organs
with
cold
water
once
or
twice
a
day
will
also
be
beneficial
it
should
not
be
practiced
however
just
before
going
to
bed
it
is
well
to
bathe
the
head
with
cold
water
and
this
can
be
done
much
better
if
the
hair
be
kept
closely
cut
horseback
riding
climbing
and
all
exercises
which
rub
chafe
or
excite
the
genital
organs
should
be
avoided
even
the
clothing
should
be
loose
so
that
walking
will
not
produce
friction
or
cause
any
excitement
of
these
organs
the
calls
of
nature
should
receive
prompt
attention
and
the
urine
be
voided
at
any
time
especially
during
the
night
when
there
is
an
inclination
if
there
be
irritation
of
the
bladder
and
lower
bowels
the
patient
will
receive
decided
benefit
from
the
daily
use
of
an
injection
of
cold
water
into
the
bowels
from
a
half
pint
to
a
pint
of
cold
water
may
be
used
at
one
time
and
the
injection
should
be
retained
for
a
few
minutes
before
going
to
bed
the
bowels
will
thus
be
relieved
the
heat
and
irritation
subdued
and
the
liability
to
seminal
emissions
lessened
patients
afflicted
with
spermatorrhea
should
not
allow
their
thoughts
to
dwell
upon
their
ailments
for
they
are
apt
to
become
moody
and
even
insane
upon
this
subject
to
avoid
this
harmless
amusements
should
be
indulged
in
and
good
moral
company
cultivated
they
become
suspicious
skeptical
and
believe
that
they
are
victims
of
imposture
when
they
lose
their
faith
and
trust
in
others
begins
to
waver
especially
if
their
health
does
not
improve
so
rapidly
as
they
had
anticipated
as
much
depends
upon
the
faithful
observance
of
the
hygienic
rules
as
upon
the
constant
and
proper
use
of
medicines
the
rapidity
of
recovery
depends
upon
the
constitutional
energies
and
the
vigor
of
the
vital
resources
if
the
blood
be
greatly
impoverished
or
the
nervous
system
much
impaired
recovery
will
be
necessarily
slow
time
patience
and
perseverance
are
just
as
essential
to
a
recovery
from
the
effects
of
these
abuses
as
the
best
medical
treatment
that
can
be
employed
the
medical
treatment
of
spermatorrhea
and
impotency
few
diseases
require
so
many
modifications
of
treatment
to
suit
the
peculiarities
of
individual
cases
as
spermatorrhea
because
it
is
attended
with
so
many
complications
and
morbid
functional
and
structural
changes
every
complication
must
be
considered
and
great
judgment
exercised
in
the
selection
of
remedies
as
this
selection
must
depend
upon
the
peculiarities
of
the
case
involved
it
is
impossible
to
impart
to
the
readers
sufficient
medical
knowledge
to
enable
them
to
choose
the
appropriate
remedies
for
these
intricate
disorders
hence
it
would
be
useless
to
specify
the
various
medicines
which
our
specialists
employ
in
treating
them
it
would
only
lead
to
many
fruitless
experiments
which
might
result
in
great
harm
to
the
afflicted
for
remedies
powerful
enough
to
effect
cures
of
spermatorrhea
and
impotency
are
capable
when
improperly
employed
of
doing
great
harm
especially
should
all
proprietary
or
medicines
such
as
are
sold
in
drug
stores
and
chemists
shops
be
avoided
for
reasons
already
mentioned
great
harm
also
often
results
from
the
employment
of
galvanic
belts
galvanic
batteries
and
pads
and
other
devices
with
which
the
too
confiding
are
not
only
duped
and
swindled
but
terribly
injured
they
are
all
worse
than
useless
and
often
render
the
mildest
case
very
difficult
to
cure
by
inducing
serious
complications
it
is
better
to
take
no
medical
treatment
but
rely
solely
on
the
hygienic
advice
we
have
given
rather
than
to
resort
to
any
of
the
found
in
the
drug
shops
or
to
any
such
silly
trash
as
the
various
pastilles
boluses
curative
rings
voltaic
belts
or
other
quackish
medicines
and
contrivances
importance
of
hygienic
discipline
the
invalid
should
restrict
his
attention
to
hygiene
and
learn
that
patient
endurance
and
heroic
perseverance
are
necessary
even
when
taking
the
most
efficient
remedies
his
entire
system
having
gradually
become
deranged
corrective
medicines
must
necessarily
be
in
their
operations
in
other
words
they
must
act
insensibly
slowly
and
progressively
some
of
the
symptoms
of
sexual
weakness
will
under
proper
hygienic
and
medical
treatment
generally
begin
to
disappear
within
a
month
if
the
nervous
system
be
very
much
impaired
however
a
longer
time
will
elapse
before
the
restorative
effects
of
treatment
will
be
observed
neither
the
physician
nor
the
patient
should
expect
that
a
constitution
can
be
immediately
repaired
the
day
of
miracles

past
the
most
rational
method
of
treating
the
sick
promises
nothing
supernatural
nothing
which
is
not
in

with
science
diseases
of
this
character
are
always
slow
in
their
inception
or

must
be

our
improved
treatment
tears
ago
our
specialists
resolved
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
investigation
and
treatment
of
these
diseases
which
are
not
only
alarmingly
prevalent
but
sadly
neglected
and
mistreated
by
the
general
practitioner
of
medicine
unfailing
remedies
having
successfully
treated
many
thousands
of
cases
we
can
safely
say
of
our
remedies
that
they
are
very
positive
in
their
remedial
effects
the
great
success
which
has
attended
the
employment
of
these
remedies
has
led
us
to
rely
upon
them
with
implicit
faith
by
their
persistent
use
spermatorrhea
and
threatened
impotency
can
be
cured
as
readily
as
other
chronic
or
lingering
diseases
we
particularly
solicit
those
cases
which
have
heretofore
been
regarded
as
incurable
the
patient
is
subjected
to
no
surgical
operation
and
he
can
safely
and
accurately
follow
the
directions
given
while
the
treatment
does
not
interfere
with
any
ordinary
occupation
in
which
he
may
be
engaged
these
delicate
diseases
should
not
be
intrusted
to
physicians
who
advertise
under
fictitious
names
or
to
those
of
ordinary
qualifications
the
general
practitioner
may
be
thoroughly
read
in
these
diseases
but
he
can
not
acquire
the
skill
of
a
specialist
who
annually
treats
thousands
of
cases
while
the
former
seldom
if
ever
has
occasion
to
prescribe
for
them
signs
of
improvement
when
under
treatment
under
our
peculiar
and
improved
system
of
treatment
gradual
improvement
in
the
condition
will
be
manifested
the
eye
becomes
more
brilliant
and
sparkling
the
patient
is
less
morose
his
digestion
improves
he
is
less
listless
and
despondent
takes
more
interest
in
business
and
other
affairs
his
sleep
is
less
disturbed
and
more
refreshing
the
strength
improves
and
if
the
sexual
organs
had
become
wasted
in
size
weak
in
function
and
flaccid
and
soft
they
begin
by
and
by
to
have
more
tone
and
firmness
and
to
develope
and
increase
in
size
as
their
nutrition
is
restored
by
the
checking
of
the
exhausting
drain
which
they
have
sustained
if
nocturnal
emissions
occur
occasionally
the
discharge
will
under
the
microscope
be
found
to
be
less
watery
and
to
contain
increased
numbers
of
with
heads
and
filaments
perfect
the
patient
now
begins
to
gain
in
courage
and
other
manly
attributes
and
instead
of
the
bashful
retiring
nervous
languid
hypochondriac
we
see
a
man
of
ambition
and
energy
competent
to
battle
with
the
adversities
of
life
who
can
estimate
the
value
of
such
a
transformation
from
nervousness
and
despondency
to
vigorous
manhood
who
would
begrudge
all
their
earthly
goods
and
treasures
when
thus
afflicted
to
be
so
restored
to
health
and
enjoyment
for
of
what
avail
are
the
greatest
riches
when
health
and
manhood
itself
are
lost
our
terms
and
fair
occasionally
persona
solicit
us
to
undertake
the
cure
of
these
ailments
and
in
case
of
failure
receive
no
compensation
they
write
if
you
will
that
your
prescriptions
will
result
in
a
restoration
to
we
will
gladly
pay
the
fees
that
you
ask
the
absurdity
of
such
a
request
is
apparent
and
therefore
we
answer
we
can
not
that
you
will
live
even
for
the
next
hours
we
do
not
bet
play
for
stakes
or
wager
our
skill
for
money
personal
responsibility
can
not
be
shifted
or
evaded
and
life
and
health
with
all
their
momentous
considerations
are
necessarily
individual
affairs
therefore
a
proposal
to
make
the
conditions
of
health
a
subject
of
speculation
is
a
challenge
to
gamble
the
patient
may
not
comply
with
the
specified
conditions
and
the
physician
success
depends
upon
a
faithful
application
of
the
prescribed
treatment
for
these
reasons
only
a
quack
will
be
a
party
to
any
such
transaction
ours
is
not
a
trading
hazardously
speculative
profession
besides
thousands
of
our
patients
reside
long
distances
away
and
we
can
not
know
of
their
responsibility
or
honesty
nor
spend
time
inquiring
after
their
financial
standing
evidences
of
the
curability
of
spermatorrhea
and
impotency
many
individuals
afflicted
with
spermatorrhea
and
impotency
particularly
those
who
have
been
swindled
by
some
of
the
many
charlatans
who
are
to
be
found
in
nearly
every
city
are
incredulous
and
doubt
our
ability
to
cure
these
maladies
others
are
skeptical
because
their
physician
who
may
be
a
very
skillful
general
practitioner
but
who
has
had
very
little
or
no
experience
in
treating
these
delicate
maladies
has
failed
to
relieve
them
and
perhaps
has
told
them
the
disease
is
incurable
we
therefore
beg
the
indulgence
of
our
readers
for
here
offering
some
indisputable
evidence
of
the
extraordinary
success
which
we
have
achieved
by
our
peculiar
methods
of
treating
these
affections
as
pursued
at
the
world
dispensary
and
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
this
evidence
is
introduced
for
the
encouragement
of
an
unfortunate
class
of
invalids
for
many
of
whom
existence
has
ceased
to
possess
any
charms
the
grateful
manifestations
which
we
have
received
from
this
class
of
sufferers
have
afforded
us
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
of
our
lives
and
have
alone
been
a
rich
remuneration
for
the
diligent
study
and
arduous
labors
devoted
to
the
investigation
of
these
diseases
and
to
the
perfecting
of
our
peculiar
and
successful
methods
of
treating
them
sacredly
confidential
in
introducing
the
following
extracts
from
our
extensive
files
of
letters
the
names
of
the
writers
will
be
omitted
as
we
regard
all
such
correspondence
as
well
as
facts
communicated
to
us
in
personal
consultations
as
lack
of
space
and
fear
of
wearying
the
reader
prevent
us
from
introducing
more
than
a
few
extracts
but
these
are
only
fair
samples
of
that
have
been
received
those
given
present
cases
in
almost
every
stage
of
treatment
some
soon
after
commencing
others
further
advanced
and
still
others
which
are
cured
if
we
could
devote
the
space
and
had
we
time
to
select
them
we
could
insert
an
almost
unlimited
number
of
those
received
from
patients
who
have
been
perfectly
cured
but
we
think
the
reader
will
be
more
interested
in
expressions
coming
from
patients
in
all
stages
of
treatment
as
they
are
daily
received
therefore
without
regard
for
literary
excellence
we
append
a
number
chosen
miscellaneously
and
given
they
express
the
sentiments
of
persons
in
all
stages
of
life
and
illustrate
the
views
and
feelings
generally
entertained
by
those
whom
we
have
been
called
upon
to
treat
the
following
extracts
are
spontaneous
acknowledgments
and
are
therefore
more
valuable
and
truthful
than
if
obtained
by
solicitation
a
practice
contrary
to
our
sense
of
propriety
and
hence
one
in
which
we
never
indulge
although
ofttimes
less
expressive
of
satisfaction
and
gratitude
than
if
the

were
presented
in

so

several

tried

it

always
practice
it
again

i
feel

pittsburgh

very

case

cured
with

treatment
world
dispensary
medical
association
it
has
now
been
nine
months
since
i
stopped
your
treatment
and
as
there
has
been
no
return
of
former
symptoms
i
judge
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
my
cure
being
permanent
i
must
confess
that
having
been
duped
and
swindled
by
so
many
previous
to
visiting
you
i
had
not
much
confidence
when
i
went
to
buffalo
to
see
you
but
your
specialists
and
your
manager
seemed
to
talk
so
straightforwardly
and
without
making
any
of
those
extravagant
promises
that
i
have
become
so
used
to
that
i
became
convinced
of
your
skill
before
i
had
been
long
in
your
wonderful
institution
i
think
almost
any
invalid
who
will
visit
your
hotel
and
see
for
themselves
the
wonderful
appliances
that
you
have
accumulated
for
the
cure
of
disease
must
soon
become
convinced
that
if
there
can
be
any
hope
of
relief
it
can
be
secured
there
if
anywhere
there
i
saw
those
who
told
me
they
had
been
brought
there
on
beds
or
couches
for
hundreds
of
miles
and
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
walk
for
two
to
four
years
and
yet
with
two
or
three
months
treatment
were
able
to
go
about
everywhere
and
were
about
ready
to
return
home
such
experiences
as
these
established
my
confidence
and
i
bless
the
day
i
first
visited
the
hotel
true
it
took
six
months
to
cure
me
but
i
presume
you
seldom
have
cases
to
equal
in
severity
the
condition
i
was
in
when
i
applied
to
you
i
was
so
bad
as
you
will
remember
though
i
do
not
suppose
you
rely
upon
any
thing
but
your
records
in
referring
to
cases
having
so
many
under
treatment
at
all
times
at
all
events
if
you
will
turn
to
the
record
of
my
case
which
is
file
no
you
will
see
that
i
had
discharges
of
semen
every
time
my
bowels
moved
and
without
erections
in
fact
i
was
completely
impotent
i
am
now
as
strong
and
vigorous
as
any
man
you
told
me
it
would
probably
take
a
year
to
cure
me
but
as
you
accomplished
it
in
five
months
though
i
continued
to
take
medicine
a
month
longer
to
insure
against
a
relapse
i
think
myself
very
fortunate
should
any
of
your
staff
have
occasion
to
come
this
way
i
should
be
only
to
glad
to
do
any
thing
i
can

the
reason
for

who
had
operated
with
the
knife
he
had
also
been
unsuccessfully
treated
by
several
home
physicians
who
stated
that
his
symptoms
of
spermatorrhea
were
all
that
could
be
described
and
more
too
the
sensations
of
crawling
and
itching
in
the
rectum
were
very
severe
and
as
a
result
of
weakness
there
was
a
serious
palpitation
of
the
heart
and
general
debility
the
generative
organs
were
unduly
excitable
and
weak
he
complained
of
weakness
in
the
rectum
and
loins
with
irregularity
of
the
bowels
trembling
and
weakness
of
the
entire
system
there
was
profuse
discharge
from
the

and
also
from
the
urethra
we
undertook
his
case
without
making
any
promises
of
a
radical
cure
as
it
seemed
that
the
disease
had
progressed
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
effect
more
than
satisfactory
improvement
in
his
general
condition
and
a
palliation
of
the

of

at
the
end
of
seven
months
treatment

writes
as
follows
world
dispensary

the
result
of
the
treatment
you
have
sent
me
is
a
permanent
cure
of
the
fistula
beyond
a
doubt
and
in
a
magical
manner
my
heart
is
very
much
improved
so
that
it
does
not
trouble
me
in
the
least
my
health
is
perfect
in
every
way
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
order
any
more
medicines
but
should
i
think
at
any
time
that
a
little
is
required
to
keep
me
in
good
health
i
will
order
at
once
i
think
that
i
am
entirely
through
with
the
fistula
and
sympathetic
weakness
and
i
can
truly
say
that
your
remedies
delivered
me
from
the
jaws
of
death
with
sincere
thanks
to
you
i
am
yours

case
spermatorrhea
the
following
and
aggravated
case
of
seminal
debility
began
to
yield
at
once
under
the
specific
influence
of
our
medicines
frequent
nocturnal
emissions
were
present
and
the
semen
also
passed
off
unobserved
and
unsuspected
in
the
urine
of
course
a
ceaseless
vital
drain
of
this
character
began
quickly
and
profoundly
to
impress
the
constitution
so
that
when
the
patient
under
consideration
applied
to
us
for
relief
the
most
unmistakable
symptoms
of
commencing
organic
disease
of
the
heart
and
lungs
had
plainly
declared
themselves
to
be
present
like
many
hundreds
of
similar
cases
which
we
cure
annually
the
disease
yielded
promptly
and
perfectly
to
the
efforts
of
our
specialist
in
this
important
branch
of
practice
indeed
so
easy
swift
and
perfect
was
the
cure
that
the
patient
failed
to
realize
the
necessity
of
continuing
the
treatment
a
few
weeks
in
order
to
insure
himself
against
the
possibility
of
a
relapse
and

treatment
to

came
duly
to

in

permit
me
to
say
that
it
was
not
my
intention
to
take
further
treatment
as
i
considered
my
cure
to
be
perfect
all
local
and
general
symptoms
having
wholly
subsided
before

had
finished
the

thus
far
manifesting
no
disposition
to
return
however
in
the
light
of
your
wisdom
and
experience
i
have
reconsidered
the
matter
and
now
believe
with
you
that
another
month
course
of
treatment
is
advisable
in
order
effectually
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
a
relapse
i
accordingly
inclose
you
the

of
the
additional
course

awoke
refreshed

and
this
experience
has
been
repeated
every

since
the

were
arrested
at
once
and
i
have
not
had
a
single
unnatural
discharge
since
except
once
when
i
experienced
a
slight
nocturnal
emission
which
however
was
followed
by
no
depressing
but
altogether
the
reverse

feel
so
much
stronger

it

from

expressing
their

for
having

we
have
we
trust
given
sufficient
to
illustrate
our
great
success
in
dealing
with
these
maladies
a
caution
to
the
afflicted
we
are
daily
consulted
by
persons
suffering
from
spermatorrhea
and
impotency
who
have
been
victimized
by
ignorant
charlatans
some
seek
to
dupe
and
swindle
the
unwary
by
claiming
to
have
themselves
been
cured
of
spermatorrhea
or
impotency
by
some
prescription
which
they
offer
to
send
free
to
any
sufferer
when
the
prescription
is
obtained
it
is
found
to
consist
of
a
few
articles
to
every
druggist
coupled
with
certain
arbitrary
and
fictitious
terms
unknown
to
everybody
and
not
to
be
found
in
any
medical
work
extant
following
the
prescription
is
a
modest
suggestion
that
if
it
can
not
be
filled
by
the
home
druggist
the
party
furnishing
the
prescription
will
be
pleased
to
send
the

from
three

five

of

the
whole
scheme
from
beginning
to

being
a
swindle
when
the

is
obtained
and

it
proves
entirely
useless

and
genuine

a
vast
experience
in
the
treatment
of
these
affections
has
satisfied
us
that
each
case
must
be
studied
and
treated
according
to
the
symptoms
manifested
and
that
medicines
that
are
adapted
to
one
stage
of
the
disease
are
entirely
unsuited
to
other

of

no

or

ever
did
or
can
help

except
it
be
in
the
imagination
although
the
proprietors
of
the
most
popular
proprietary
medicines
in
the
market
medicines
carefully
adapted
to
the
cure
of
the
diseases
for
which
they
are
recommended
yet
should
we
attempt
to
get
up
a
general
remedy
to
cure
spermatorrhea
and
kindred
maladies
we
are
certain
it
would
be
an
utter
failure
and
this
is
entirely
true
of
all
such
preparations
now
and
heretofore
offered
for
sale
and
from
the
very
nature
of
the
diseases
they
are
recommended
to
cure
ever
must
be
each
case
must
have
medicines
carefully
prepared
to
meet
the
conditions
present
and
when
these
conditions
from
the
effects
of
treatment
or
other
causes
change
the
treatment
must
be
varied
accordingly
positive
injury
instead
of
benefit
often
results
from
the
employment
of
some
of
the
nostrums
advertised
for
the
cure
of
spermatorrhea
impotency
and
kindred
affections
especially
have
we
found
that
the
use
of
soluble
urethral
crayons
boluses
pastiles
and
kindred
contrivances
which
are
so
extensively
advertised
are
exceedingly
injurious
and
often
render
otherwise
moderate
and
simple
cases
complicated
and
incurable
although
of
pretended
french
origin
they
are
evidently
the
invention
of
an
ignoramus
who
knows
nothing
of
the
delicate
anatomy
of
the
generative
organs
or
of
the
proper
treatment
of
the
diseases
incident
thereto
for
none
other
would
have
thought
of
such
a
preposterous
plan
of
treatment
no
man
should
insert
such
absurdly
devised
and
mischief
breeding
contrivances
into
his
urethra
urinary
canal
for
thereby
he
is
almost
sure
to
do
himself
a
permanent
injury
so
far
from
having
been
invented
by
an
eminent
french
surgeon
as
claimed
such
treatment
is
entirely
unknown
in
france
and
ever
has
been
as
the
writer
well
knows
from
personal
observation
and
enquiry
while
sojourning
in

country
and
visiting
its
most
noted
hospitals
and

institutions
all
the
various
troches

rectal
pearls
rectal
capsules
and
other
contrivances
which
are
recommended
for

weaknesses
and
which
are
designed
to
be
employed
by
inserting
them
into
the
lower
bowel
rectum
and
there
permitting
them
to
dissolve
are
only
so
many
irrational
and
filthy
devices
for
duping
the
ignorant
and
innocent
sufferers
from
these
maladies
an
alluring
swindle
a
still
more
enticing
and
hence
more
dangerous
device
for
swindling
unfortunate
sufferers
is
the
widely
advertised
vacuum
treatment
or
appliance
so
loudly
and
plausibly
recommended
for
developing
weak

organs
a
simple
little
brass
air
pump
connected
with
a
glass
tube
or
cylinder
fitted
with
a
valve
at
one
end
which
costs
not
to
exceed
one
dollar
and
a
half
is
the
worthless
device
palmed
off
on
the
confiding
ones
from
fifteen
to
thirty
this
is
done
under
the
that
its
daily
use
to
pump
blood
into
the
weak
or
wasted
organs
will
cause
their
development
and
growth
thousands
have
invested
their
hard
earned
cash
in
this
worse
than
worthless
injurious
contrivance
in
fact
the
head
of
the
concern
putting
out
this
alluring
device
is
said

of

can

the
methods

advanced
by

a

its
superiority
over
every

should
avoid

the

none
of
them
are
worth
a
moment

making
great
pretensions
as

to
whom
he
had
paid
several
hundred
dollars
in
the
vain
hope
of
getting
cured
of
spermatorrhea
they
treated
him
with
medicines
only
and
did
him
no
good
whatever
on
examination
we
found
a
very
varicose
or
enlarged
condition
of
the
left
spermatic
veins
and
gave
it
as
our
opinion
that
the
seminal
loss
was
wholly
due
to
this
abnormal
condition
and
could
only
be
cured
by
an
operation
that
would
remove
the
varicocele
the
operation
was
promptly
performed
in
two
days

was
able
to
leave
his
bed
and
in
a
week
started
home
to

months
thereafter
we
received
a
letter
from
him
wherein
he
said
the
enlarged
veins
continued
to
absorb
and
grow
less
and
less
until
in
a
few
weeks
time
all
unnatural
enlargement
had
disappeared
with
a
steady
improvement
in
the
condition
of
the
veins
i
experienced
corresponding
improvement
in
my
general
health
and
the
seminal
losses
grew
less
and

ago
disappeared

saved

fooled

uniform
satisfaction

success

has

painless
operation

the
injection
of
a
few
drops
of
a
medicated
solution
under
the
skin
at
the
point
where
the
incision
is
to
be
made
we
are
now
able
to
produce
such
complete
local
anæsthesia
as
to
render
the
operation
without
the
administration
of
either
chloroform
or
ether
this
is
an
important
consideration
as
many
are
averse
to
taking
chloroform
or
ether
and
now
that
we
are
possessed
of
an
agent
that
produces
locally
insensibility
to

are
very
glad
to
be
able
to
dispense
with
their
use

minor
operations

very
painful

rendered

use
of
this
wonderful
agent
a
great
variety
of
surgical
operations
are
now
performed
by
our
surgeon
specialists
without
any
suffering
on
the
part
of
our
patients
by
the
local
use
of
an
anæsthetic
solution
injected
into
the
parts
to
be
operated
upon
formerly
we
were
obliged
either
to
administer
chloroform
or
ether
or
subject
our
patients
to
a
great
deal
of
suffering
our
specialists
were
among
the
first
surgeons
in
this
country
to
employ
local
anæsthesia
successfully
we
regard
it
as
a
great
boon
to
our
patients
and
never
withhold
it
in
any
case
where
it
can
be
employed
to
prevent
suffering
its
use

attended
with
no
danger
and
followed
by
no
bad
or
disagreeable
results

unvarying
success
during
the
past
years
upon

surgical
institute
we
now
invite
special
attention
to
the
results
of
our
peculiar
operation
which
is
neither
severe
nor
dangerous
and
from
which
the
patient
makes

in
every
respect
more
satisfactory
recovery
than
from
other
operations
in
use

we
have
never
failed
to
secure
the
happiest
results
from
our
operation
the
saving
of
time
is
also
of
importance
to
the
laboring
man
as
well
as
to
the
millionaire
instead
of
being
confined
to
his
bed
for
ten
to
twenty
days
and
to
his
room
for
a
month
or
more
as
is
the
case
following
other
operations
the
patient
is
not
confined
to
bed
at
all
and
can
generally
return
home
in
a
week
or
ten
days
at
the
longest
the
only
precaution
necessary
is
that
he
should
for
a
reasonable
time
after
the
operation
wear
a
suspensory
bandage
this
can
in
a
little
time
be
entirely
dispensed
with
when
we
contrast
these
results
with
those
obtained
from
ligation
graduated
pressure
by
clamps
suture
pins
or
the
slicing
off
of
a
part
of
the
scrotum
and
suturing

gaping
wound

caused
as
is
practiced

superiority
of
the
results
obtained
through

method
of
operating
on
this
affection
must
be

often
weaken
the
scrotal
muscles
by
the
unnatural
compression
which
they
produce
and
make
the
discomfort
far
worse
when
they
are
discontinued

i
feel
it
my
duty
to
thank
you
for
the
benefit
i
received
at
your
institution
during
the
month
of
december
i
was
afflicted
with
varicocele
on
the
left
side
which
caused
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
almost
made
me
feel
at
times
that
i
did
not
want
to
live
any
longer
if
i
could
not
be
restored
to
soundness
again
hearing
of
your
skill
in
the
treatment
of
varicocele
i
determined
to
give
you
a
trial
which
i
accordingly
did
and
with
gratifying
results
for
now
i
am
as
sound
and
well
as
a
gold
dollar
the
operation
which
was
performed
on
me
at
your
institution
for
the
permanent
cure
of
varicocele
was
to
my
great
surprise
entirely
painless
and
performed
in
a
much
briefer
time
than
i
expected
i
only
remained
at
your
noble
institution
ten
days
after
the
operation
at
the
end
of
which
time
i
returned
to
my
home
at
chatham
hill
smyth
va
when
i
got
home
i
experienced
very
little
soreness
from
the
operation
and
i
felt
that
i
could
enjoy
life
fully
about
six
months
after
i
got
married
and
came
to
utah
where
i
now
reside
and
i
am
very
much
pleased
to
say
that
i
am
now
as
sound
and
well
as
ever
and
very
happy
in
my
married
state
when
i
went
to
your
institution
i
was
surprised
to
see
such
a
great
number
of
young
men
from
almost
every
state
in
the
union
who
had
come
there
to
be
operated
upon
for
varicocele
and
they
all
told
me
that
the
operation
was
painless
to
them
as
it
also
was
to
me
and
they
said
they
were
fast
improving
and
were
glad
they
had
come
there
for
treatment
i
never
experienced
such
great
and
unprecedented
kindness
as
i
did
during
the
ten
days
i
was
at
the
invalids
hotel
i
had
an
excellent
room
well
furnished
plenty
to
eat
and
was
treated
with
the
kindness
of
a
mother
by
the
nurses
and
attending
physician
i
advise
all
who
are
afflicted
with
varicocele
to
go
to
your
institution
at
once
for
an
operation
which
i
assure
them
they
will
never
regret
trusting
that
those
who
require
an
operation
of
any
kind
or
who
are
afflicted
in
any
way
may
go
to
your
institution
and
be
restored
to
health
and
again
thanking
you
for
my
restoration
to
health
and
your
great
kindness

good
treatment

i

those
suffering

to
your
skillful

i
suffered
with
varicocele
for
seven
years
caused
by
standing
behind
the
counter
at
business
from
seven
in
the
morning
until
ten
and
twelve
at
night
in
a
friend
gave
me
a
copy
of
your
common
sense
medical
adviser
after
perusing
its
pages
i
was
convinced
of
the
genuineness
of
its
doctrine
i
immediately
started
for
buffalo
a
distance
of
miles
during
my
stay
of
ten
days
at
your
institution
i
was
treated
with
the
utmost
kindness
by
the
nurses
and
surgeons
all
of
whom
are
expert
specialists
the
equipment
of
the
institution
is
something
immense
i
often
think
of
the
appetite
those
healthy
exercises
in
the
treatment
room
gave
me
when
dinner
time
came
after
being
in
the
institution
three
days
i
underwent
an
operation
for
varicocele
an
injection
of
medicine
locally
making
the
operation
free
from
the
operation
was
performed
in
about
thirty
minutes
immediately
after
which
i
could
walk
to
my
room
and
after
resting
an
hour
descended
to
the
dining
room
and
took
my
dinner
as
usual
while
at
the
institution
i
met
numerous
persons
suffering
from
varicocele
and
it
was
quite
pleasing
to
contrast
their
happy
looks
as
they
wished
you
goodbye
with
the
haggard
appearance
they
had
upon
entering
after
leaving
the
institution
i
traveled
about
miles
by
rail
and
miles
by
water
without
the
least
inconvenience
which
i
consider
a
fair
test
of
the
operation
five
years
have
passed
since
that
time
and
i
now
feel
as
sound
as
it
is
possible
to
feel
in
conclusion
let
me
say
to
those
suffering
from
varicocele
that
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
do
better
than
follow
my
example

i
am
a

some
years
ago
i
fell
from
a
scaffold
which
in
time
almost
killed
me
i
was
hurt
very
much
at
the
time
but
a
dull
aching
pain
seemed
to
take
me
in
the
left
side
of
the
scrotum
and
after
i
could
stand
it
no

i
went
to
my
doctor
he
said
that
i
had
a
rupture
of
the
blood
veins
of
the
left

and
it
was
incurable
i
gave
up
in
despair

at

a

handed
me
some
of
your

and
i
saw
the
common

advertised
and
sent
for
the
book
and
studied
its
contents
carefully
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
was
suffering
from
varicocele
i
found
on
consulting
you
that
my
suspicions
were
right
i
at
once
wrote
you
for
particulars
and
in
less
than
a
week
i
was
at
the
invalids
hotel
for
treatment
at
that
time
no
one
knows
how
i
suffered
but
i
had
long
to
suffer
in
ten
days
after
entirely
painless
i
was
a
well

and
returned
home
i
can
not
say
too
much
in

to
the
treatment

care
from
both
surgeons

nothing
was
left
undone
to
promote
comfort

good

it
is
the
only
place
on

that
i
would

safe

for

bad

with

some

painless

about
twenty

the

was
a

successful
one
considering
the
long
time
my
trouble
had
been
neglected
as
i
have
suffered
little
or

a

of
patients
at
the

from
all

the

an
institution
in

presided

honest
and
pleasant
lot
of
medical
experts
who
certainly
know
their
business
i
can
not
speak
of
it
too
highly
i
was
treated
there
in
the
summer
of
for
rupture
of
the
spermatic
veins
previous
to
which
i
had
been
operated
on
two
different
times
with
no
relief
by
a
doctor
here
in
this
place
cracked
up
to
be
one
of
the
best
in

and
an
officer
of

the
operation
at

painless
did
not
have
to

any
anæsthetic
neither
was
i
confined

the

a

while
in
the
two
previous

i

i
was

a

another

scarcely
able

worse

enough

has

a
half
years
after
i
had
been
cured
of
my
difficulty
at

i
commenced
having
terrible
pains
in
my
leg
and
abdomen
for
which
i
could
not
account
and
after
standing
it
until
it
seemed
as
though
i
would
be
glad
to
die
i
again
consulted
the

after
a
thorough
investigation
they
operated
on
me
where
my
pain
seemed
the
most
apparent
and
dug
out
a
piece
of
a

needle
something
over
half
an
inch
in
length
that
had
been
broken
off
in
the
first
operation
i
had
by
the
doctor
here
at
home
and
so
admitted
by
him
when
confronted
with
it
i
have
spent
lots
of
money
and
nearly
six
years
of
the
worst
pain
man
ever
stood
getting
relief
while
had
i
known
of
this

on
the

an
operation
with
no
pain
whatever
and
scarcely
more
discomfort
than
a
sore
mouth
after
having
a
tooth
removed
would
have
ended
it
all
in
conclusion
i
will
say
to
any
poor
sufferer
do
do
as
i
did
and
put
your
trust
in
the
greatest
doctor
you
have

you

patients
about

in
the
year
sometime
in
july
i
jumped
from
a
load
of
lumber
to
the
ground
and
at
once
felt
a
sharp
severe
pain
along
the
spermatic
cord
of
left
side
of
scrotum
preventing
my
walking
to
the
house
without
help
the
veins
near
the
cord
filled
to
such
extent
that
they
seemed
solid
and
could
not
be
reduced
for
some
time
i
went
to
a
good
doctor
and
by
him
was
advised
to
pay
no
attention
to
it
it
will
not
amount
to
much
from
that
time
i
suffered
continually
and
will
not
try
to
describe
what
i
endured
until
i
was
relieved
by
a
surgical
operation
performed
on
me
by
the
of
the
hotel
and
surgical
institute
of
buffalo
after
for
several
years
my
suffering
increased
and
i
was
advised
to
consult
of
chicago
hahnemann
college
of
homeopathic
school
and
by
him
was
informed
an
operation
of
tieing
the
veins
choking
them
off
could
be
performed
but
per
cent
if
i
remember
rightly
of
the
operations
proved
fatal
i
decided
not
to
try
it
by
accident
i
learned
of
your
great
skill
and
though
my
case
was
of
years
time
and
my
health
and
strength
gone
i
considered
the
method
plausible
and
reasonably
safe
i
had
the
operation
performed
and
now
after
six
years
have
passed
i
can
say
with
satisfaction
there
is
little
to
be
noticed
or
remind
me
of
the
past
years
of
misery
the

feel

to
you
for
the
cure
of
varicocele
i
was
troubled
ten
years
with
this
annoying
disease
caused
i
think
by
being
thrown
from
a
horse
my
case
was
of
a
very
obstinate
character
i
was
treated
by
a
leading
specialist
of
omaha
without
success
and
without
being
in
the
least
benefited
i
expended
the
neat
little
sum
of
and
then
sank
back
in
despair
losing
all
hopes
of
a
cure
i
had
previous
to
my
treatment
in
omaha
noticed
a
little
hand
or
memorandum
book
of
the
world
dispensary
and
again
one
came
to
my
notice
i
mustered
up
courage
to
write
to
you
and
in
june
i
visited
your
institute
for
treatment
i
was
treated
by
the
best
skilled
surgeons
and
given
best
attention
by
experienced
nurses
i
met
a
number
of
patients
while
under
treatment
troubled
with
various
and
complex
diseases
who
expressed
their
gratitude
to
the
faculty
of
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
the
operation
performed
was
rendered
painless
owing
to
local
applications
previously
applied
after
the
operation
which
was
about
i
rested
until
noon
and
responded
to
the
dinner
call
as
usual
i
was
required
to
remain
but
ten
days
then
returned
home
a
distance
of
some
twelve
hundred
miles
i
wore
a
neat
fitting
support
for
about
six
months
and
then
abandoned
it
and
have
gone
as
nature
created
me
oh
what
a
relief
i
had
worn
a
suspensory
for
about
six
years
i
have
had
no
return
of
former
trouble
it
being
now
about
two
years
since
the
operation
to
any
suffering
with

i
must
say
do
delay
but
place
yourself
under

at

testicle
of
the
corresponding
side
often
causing
it
to
retract
there
is
usually
also
sympathetic
pain
shooting
down
the
thigh
we
have
seen
patients
roll
on
the
floor
in
the
greatest
agony
cold
sweat
meanwhile
pouring
down
their
faces
when
thus
suffering
the
patient
may
also
vomit
violently
through
nervous
sympathy
the
urine
is
apt
to
be
bloody
and
there
is
a
constant
desire
to
pass
it
there
is
pain
in
the
end
of
the
penis
and
also
in
the
lower
portion
of
the
abdomen
the
bladder
this
is
a
sac
or
reservoir
to
receive
and
hold
the
urine
as
it
comes
from
the
kidneys
through
the
ureters
its
walls
are
partly
composed
of
muscle
and
partly
of
a
lining
mucous
membrane
the
muscular
coating
is
external
and
it
is
by
its
contraction
that
the
urine
is
expelled
when
empty
the
bladder
shrinks
down
to
a
small
size
as
compared
with
its
distended
condition
when
filled
it
is
capable
of
holding
about
one
pint
if
it
is
distended
by
the
retention
of
urine
much
beyond
this
capacity
the
muscular
coats
lose
their
force
and
often
the
urine
can
not
be
passed
naturally
in
health
when
the
bladder
becomes
filled
and
distended
there
is
a
consequent
desire
to
empty
it
by
passing
water
illustration
fig
the
voiding
of
the
urine
should
not
be
attended
with
the
slightest
pain
or
disagreeable
sensations
and
the
desire
to
pass
it
should
not
be
frequent
when
there
is
frequent
desire
to
pass
it
or
when
its
passage
is
attended
with
pain
there
is
irritation
or
inflammation
in
the
coats
of
the
bladder
or
in
the
urethra
this
may
arise
from
an
excessively
acid
or
irritating
condition
of
the
urine
as
well
as
from
various
other
causes
gonorrhea
or
clap
stricture
of
the
urethra
which
impedes
the
free
flow
of
the
urine
enlargement
or
inflammation
of
the
prostate
gland
gravel
and
stone
in
the
bladder
are
all
capable
of
creating
a
frequent
desire
to
pass
water
whatever
the
unhealthy
condition
may
be
which
gives
rise
to
this
troublesome
symptom
it
calls
for
prompt
and
skillful
treatment
for
the
most
trivial
affections
of
these
organs
often
pass
into
those
that
are
exceedingly
intractable
if
not
incurable
the
examination
of
the
urine
the
urine
itself
when
subjected
to
microscopical
or
chemical
examination
as
we
shall
hereafter
more
fully
explain
offers
the
best
means
of
determining
the
exact
nature
of
these
distressing
affections
when
normal
the
urine
is
of
a
pale
and
throws
down
no
deposits
on
cooling
in
passing
it
no
difficulty
or
pain
should
be
experienced
and
it
should
spurt
from
the
urethra
in
a
full
round
and
regular
stream
until
the
bladder
is
entirely
emptied
if
the
stream
is
forked
checked
or
interrupted
in
any
way
before
the
bladder
is
completely
emptied
it
is
evidence
that
something
is
wrong
stricture
of
the
urethra
prostatic
disease
and
gravel
or
stone
in
the
bladder
are
all
capable
of
producing
obstruction
to
the
free
flow
of
the
urine
how
slight
ailments
become
dangerous
diseases
as
we
have
before
stated
the
mucous
membrane
lining
the
bladder
is
reflected
upwards
into
the
ureters
lining
these
canals
by
reason
of
this
continuity
of
mucous
surfaces
patients
suffering
from
urethral
prostatic
and
bladder
affections
often
die
from
disease
of
the
kidneys
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
because
stricture
of
the
urethra
does
not
with
disease
that
the
latter
may
not
have
been
caused
by
the
obstruction
in
the
urethra
due
to
stricture
pulmonary
consumption
for
instance
often
begins
in
the
form
of
nasal
catarrh
but
by
the
continuity
of
the
mucous
membrane
it
travels
so
to
speak
into
the
throat
or
pharnyx
from
the
pharnyx
into
the
larnyx
and
then
into
the
lung
structure
itself
the
disease
is
transferred
from
the
nose
into
the
lung
tissue
what
occurs
in
the
nasal
laryngeal
and
pulmonary
tract
of
mucous
membrane
happens
also
in
the
urinary
tract
a
gonorrhea
which
is
a
specific
acute
inflammation
of
the
urethral
canal
leaves
behind
it
a
slight
gleet
or
chronic
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
urethra
this
may
give
little
inconvenience
for
a
number
of
years
but
gradually
it
culminates
in
a
stricture
or
implicating
the
prostatic
portion
of
the
urethra
occasions
inflammation
of
the
prostate
gland
and
perhaps
enlargement
of
this
organ
this
gradually
gives
rise
to
cystitis
or
inflammation
of
the
bladder
from
the
bladder
the
disease
travels
up
the
ureters
into
the
kidneys
and
finally
disease
is
established
in
these
organs
the
mucous
membrane
lining
the
bladder
also
extends
through
the
urethra
throughout
the
interior
of
the
body
whether
it
be
in
the
stomach
lungs
or
other
parts
this
lining
mucous
membrane
serves
as
a
protection
to
the
parts
beneath
just
as
the
skin
on
the
exterior
of
the
body
serves
as
a
protection
to
the
sensitive
true
skin
and
the
tissues
underneath
it
the
cause
of
certain
distressing
symptoms
close
to
the
neck
of
the
bladder
is
a
triangular
space
on
which
the
mucous
membrane
is
smoother
and
devoid
of
folds
or
rugae
and
which
is
far
more
sensitive
and
vascular
than
other
portions
of
the
mucous
membrane
lining
this
organ
it
is
called
the
this
is
the
most
depending
part
of
the
bladder
if
there
be
stone
in
the
bladder
it
naturally
gravitates
and
rests
on
this
sensitive
space
so
that
when
the
bladder
is
empty
the
foreign
body
occasions
inconvenience
until
the
urine
trickling
down
through
the
ureters
and
intervening
between
the
mucous
membrane
and
the
stone
serves
as
a
temporary
protection
to
the
mucous
surface
hence
the
pain
becomes
less
as
the
urine
is
secreted
until
the
water
is
again
passed
and
the
intervening
fluid
thereby
removed
when
the
stone
again
presses
upon
and
irritates
the
sensitive
by
coming
into
more
immediate
contact
with
it
the
greater
ease
with
patients
afflicted
with
stone
experience
in
a
recumbent
position
in
bed
or
on
a
sofa
compared
with
being
in
an
erect
posture
is
easily
explained
the
foreign
body
when
the
patient
is
standing
walking
or
riding
falls
by
its
own
gravity
on
this
sensitive
spot
when
in
a
recumbent
position
it
rolls
away
from
this
sensitive
into
the
back
part
of
the
bladder
where
the
mucous
membrane
is
less
sensitive
consequently
the
patient
suffering
from
stone
in
the
bladder
is
more
easy
at
night
whereas
one
suffering
from
prostatic
disease
whether
it
be
inflammation
of
the
prostate
gland
or
enlargement
of
that
organ
is
usually
worse
in
bed
how
bladder
diseases
come
to
be
confounded
with
other
diseases
the
bladder
is
largely
supplied
with
lymphatics
and
nerves
given
off
from
the
same
systems
that
supply
the
rectum
or
lower
bowel
and
in
females
the
uterus
or
womb
and
the
ovaries
this
accounts
in
a
great
measure
for
the
symptoms
of
bladder
disease
in
those
afflicted
with
piles
or
other
diseases
of
the
lower
bowel
or
of
diseases
of
the
uterus
or
womb
in
the
female
we
have
frequently
been
consulted
by
patients
who
had
erroneously
supposed
themselves
to
be
suffering
from
disease
of
the
bladder
or
of
the
prostate
gland
but
whom
we
found
on
examination
to
be
suffering
from
hemorrhoids
or
piles
in
these
cases
by
removal
of
the
pile
tumors
the
frequent
desire
to
urinate
and
all
pain
in
the
region
of
the
bladder
are
promptly
relieved
sometimes
ulcers
located
in
the
rectum
give
very
little
unpleasant
sensation
in
the
bowel
but
produce
pain
in
the
bladder
with
frequent
desire
to
urinate
enlargement
of
the
uterus
the
womb
or
displacements
of
that
organ
as
prolapsus
or
anteversion
and
all
capable
of
producing
symptoms
of
bladder
disease
a
frequent
desire
to
urinate
and
more
or
less
sharp
pain
in
the
region
of
the
bladder
are
usually
experienced
in
these
cases
disease
of
the
bladder
in
like
manner
often
produces
an
apparent
disease
of
other
organs
through
sympathy
and
without
great
care
in
diagnosticating
each
case
the
may
be
taken
for
the
and
the
patient
treated
for
a
disease
which
does
not
really
exist
the
urethra
the
urethra
in
the
male
is
the
canal
extending
from
the
bladder
to
the
end
of
the
penis
through
which
the
urine
is
passed
this
canal
starts
from
the
base
of
the
bladder
passes
through
the
prostate
gland
and
entering
the
penis
continues
of
about
uniform
size
along
the
under
part
of
the
penis
until
it
reaches
the
glans
or
head
of
that
organ
where
it
expands
somewhat
into
a
fossa
or
cavity
and
becomes
reduced
again
at
the
orifice
at
a
short
distance
from
the
bladder
it
receives
the
outlets
of
the
seminal
ducts
the
urethra
is
a
most
delicate
and
sensitive
canal
and
is
surrounded
by
tissues
of
like
delicacy
and
is
lined
with
a
mucous
membrane
which
is
highly
vascular
and
filled
with
sensitive
nerves
the
introduction
of
any
instrument
into
this
canal
is
to
be
undertaken
only
when
absolutely
required
and
when
necessary
it
should
be
so
skillfully
and
carefully
effected
that
no
pain
or
irritation
can
result
the
slightest
awkwardness
is
liable
to
cause
an
unnoticeable
injury
which
may
result
in
a
false
passage
or
an
effusion
of
plastic
lymph
around
the
canal
which
organizing
forms
the
most
troublesome
kind
of
organic
structure
by
proper
and
early
treatment
all
danger
and
pain
is
avoided
and
a
cure
effected
in
a
very
short
time
in
an
extensive
practice
in
which
we
yearly
treat
thousands
of
cases
we
have
never
yet
failed
to
give
perfect
and
permanent
relief
from
stricture
or
disease
of
the
prostrate
gland
without
the
necessity
of
using
cutting
instruments
of
any
kind
when
we
have
been
consulted
before
injury
to
the
urethra
has
been
produced
by
the
improper
use
of
instruments
having
specialists
who
devote
their
entire
time
and
attention
to
the
study
of
these
diseases
we
are
able
to
relieve
and
cure
a
large
number
painlessly
and
speedily
in
which
the
awkward
manipulations
of
physicians
or
surgeons
whose
hands
untrained
by
constant
and
skillful
use
not
only
fail
to
effect
any
benefit
but
set
up
new
or
aggravate
existing
disease
this
subject
will
receive
a
more
full
and
complete
consideration
in
another
part
of
this
treatise
the
prostate
gland
the
prostate
is
a
gland
of
about
the
size
and
shape
of
a
large
chestnut
lying
just
in
front
of
the
bladder
and
surrounding
the
urethra
the
size
of
the
prostate
gland
varies
considerably
with
the
age
of
the
person
in
early
life
it
weighs
but
a
few
grains
as
puberty
approaches
it
becomes
larger
and
in
the
adult
weighs
from
half
an
ounce
to
an
ounce
in
old
age
it
enlarges
considerably
and
sometimes
presses
upon
the
bladder
so
as
to
impede
the
flow
of
urine
this
condition
is
often
confounded
with
stricture
gravel
or
stone
in
the
bladder
by
inexperienced
physicians
hypertrophy
or
enlargement
of
the
prostate
gland
is
not
an
unfrequent
disease
in
the
adult
or
man
being
in
close
contact
with
the
bladder
when
it
enlarges
it
encroaches
on
the
bladder
pressing
on
it
and
it
has
the
effect
of
interfering
with
the
function
of
urination
as
before
indicated
enlargement
or
hypertrophy
of
the
prostate
gland
is
often
confounded
with
stricture
gravel
and
stone
in
the
bladder
by
inexperienced
physicians
and
treated
accordingly
the
true
condition
of
this
gland
is
readily
determined
by
an
examination
through
the
rectum
or
lower
bowel
the
finger
of
the
expert
surgeon
being
able
to
determine
at
once
whether
it
is
enlarged
or
not
the
danger
of
bad
treatment
in
disease
of
the
prostate
gland
as
well
as
in
inflammation
of
the
kidneys
and
bladder
stricture
of
the
urethra
and
many
other
forms
of
urinary
disease
the
use
of
stimulating
diuretics
and
the
kidney
cures
buchus
and
similar
preparations
which
largely
increase
the
flow
of
urine
simply
aggravate
and
do
positive
harm
in
fact
the
most
difficult
cases
that
we
have
had
to
deal
with
have
been
those
that
through
such
treatment
either
taken
on
their
own
account
or
prescribed
by
inexperienced
physicians
have
been
rendered
so
much
worse
as
to
make
their
cases
very
intractable
and
tedious
to
relieve
and
cure
require
nicely
adapted
treatment
as
we
have
heretofore
indicated
there
is
no
class
of
diseases
that
require
nicer
adaptation
of
medicines
to
each
individual
case
than
those
of
the
urinary
organs
medicines
which
in
one
stage
of
these
diseases
are
beneficial
and
curative
in
another
stage
are
often
exceedingly
injurious
hence
it
is
that
we
claim
it
to
be
impossible
for
any
one
to
put
up
any
set
prescription
or
proprietary
medicine
that
will
meet
the
wants
of
a
large
percentage
of
this
class
of
cases
the
only
rational
course
to
be
pursued
is
to
examine
carefully
each
case
as
it
is
presented
find
out
the
exact
condition
and
stage
of
the
disease
with
which
the
patient
is
afflicted
and
then
prescribe
for
it
such
special
medicines
as
are
nicely
and
exactly
adapted
to
the
patient
condition
these
in
many
cases
will
have
to
be
changed
from
time
to
time
to
suit
the
condition
of
the
disease
as
it
is
modified
by
the
treatment
not
only
have
the
manufacturers
of
buchus
kidney
cures
committed
grave
errors
by
prescribing
stimulating
diuretics
for
almost
all
kidney
and
bladder
diseases
under
the
impression
that
as
the
patient
passes
only
a
small
quantity
of
urine
at
a
time
the
kidneys
should
be
stimulated
to
secrete
more
but
physicians
in
general
practice
have
been
very
prone
to
commit
the
same
error
in
their
practices
when
the
bladder
and
kidneys
are
in
a
weak
and
diseased
condition
incapable
of
efficient
action
the
bladder
being
already
unable
to
dispose
of
the
diminished
quantity
of
urine
secreted
it
is
simply
outrageous
practice
to
administer
medicines
calculated
to
stimulate
the
kidneys
to
perform
more
work
by
being
thus
forced
these
organs
become
seriously
diseased
it
would
appear
most
unreasonable
to
whip
and
spur
a
horse
already
jaded
from
overwork
common
sense
would
dictate
rest
which
always
does
good
but
as
the
bladder
is
weak
the
doctor
whips
up
the
kidneys
with
drugs
thus
endeavoring
to
force
them
to
secrete
more
urine
and
thereby
the
poor
crippled
bladder
which
is
incapable
of
disposing
of
even
the
diminished
quantity
secreted
is
actually
made
to
do
more
work
in
a
diseased
and
feeble
condition
than
it
would
perform
in
a
sound
strong
and
healthy
state
the
results
of
this
pernicious
practice
are
disease
of
the
kidneys
cystitis
or
inflammation
of
the
bladder
and
numerous
other
grave
maladies
kidney
disease
diseases
of
the
kidneys
are
generally
very
slow
in
their
inception
coming
on
gradually
and
manifesting
no
special
symptoms
of
their
presence
until
they
have
assumed
a
formidable
character
for
this
reason
they
are
the
more
dangerous
simple
derangement
of
the
urinary
secretion
is
no
evidence
of
disease
of
these
organs
as
changes
in
the
color
quantity
and
specific
gravity
of
the
urine
are
often
produced
by
changes
of
temperature
active
or
sedentary
habits
mental
emotion
and
sometimes
by
articles
of
diet
or
drink
as
well
as
by
the
use
of
different
drugs
the
existence
of
disease
of
the
kidneys
in
the
early
stages
can
only
be
positively
determined
by
a
microscopical
and
chemical
examination
of
the
urine
which
reveals
to
us
the
presence
of
casts
epithelia
blood
pus
etc
the
microscope
informs
us
not
only
of
the
presence
of
disease
but
very
often
of
the
particular
portion
of
the
kidney
in
which
it
is
located
as
well
as
of
the
stage
which
the
disease
has
reached
we
are
also
aided
by
chemistry
in
determining
the
exact
abnormal
condition
of
the
kidneys
by
the
detection
of
albumen
sugar
etc
these
examinations
by
aid
of
the
microscope
and
chemical
should
never
be
neglected
by
the
physician
without
them
his
diagnosis
or
judgment
of
the
patient
condition
is
simply
with
them
he
is
enabled
to
base
his
treatment
upon
certain
and
positive
knowledge
of
the
patient
real
and
true
condition
the
usual
symptoms
of
chronic
disease
of
the
kidneys
but
which
vary
materially
with
the
age
constitutional
peculiarities
and
temperament
are
weakness
in
the
small
of
the
back
pains
in
the
region
of
the
loins
and
groins
numbness
of
the
thigh
on
the
side
of
the
affected
kidney
for

without

examination
of

bright
disease
this
affection
may
appear
in
either
an
acute
or
chronic
form
the
acute
form
is
frequently
a
complication
or
sequel
of
scarlet
fever
diphtheria
cholera
typhoid
fever
erysipelas
or
measles
and
is
frequently
developed
by
intemperance
the
acute

is
very
rapid
in

progress
often
destroying
life
by
uraemic
poisoning
the
retention

the
symptoms
of
the
acute
form
are
diminution

dry

pains
in

and
a
general
dropsical
puffy
condition
of

especially
manifesting
itself
in
the
earlier
stages
under

gradually
showing
itself
in

or
swelling
of
the
feet
and
lower
extremities
generally
unless
promptly
relieved
the
patient
dies
of
coma
stupor
or
from
convulsions
no
person
should
be
so
rash
as
to
attempt
the
treatment
of
this
dangerous
affection
without
the
aid
of
the
best
medical
skill
that
can
be
procured
it
is
the
chronic
form
of
bright
disease
that
we
propose
principally
to
discuss
in
this
article
true
bright
disease
of
the
kidneys
is
an
insidious
and
most
fatal
form
of
organic
disease
we
venture
to
assert
that
less
than
one
per
cent
of
those
who
imagine
they
have
bright
have
this
disease
at
all
we
find
that
most
of
those
who
as
one
of
our
faculty
puts
it
upon
disease
base
their
diagnosis
upon
the
condition
of
the
urinary
secretion
and
especially
upon
the
copiousness
of
the
deposit
whereas
in
true
bright
deposits
of
any
kind
are
rarely
met
with
perhaps
the
form
of
deposit
most
commonly
mistaken
for
bright
disease
is
that
known
to
medical
men
as
the
when
the
urates
are
in
excess
they
form
a
heavy
pinkish
deposit
of
a
flocculent
nature
within
from
five
to
thirty
minutes
after
the
urine
has
been
passed
that
is
after
it
has
been
passed
sufficiently
long
to
cool
to
prove
that
the
deposit
is
urates
heat
the
specimen
to
the
temperature
of
the
blood
when
the
deposit
in
question
will
disappear
excess
of
urates
has
now
been
definitely
traced
in
the
majority
of
instances
to
functional
torpidity
of
the
liver
another
common
form
of
deposit
is
that
in
which
the
reaction
of
the
urine
instead
of
being
acid
as
in
health
is
either
neutral
or
alkaline
and
in
which
the
earthy
phosphates
are
precipitated
for
this
reason
the
earthy
phosphates
when
thrown
down
by
a
neutral
or
an
alkaline
condition
of
the
urine
appear
as
a
heavy
white
deposit
which
though
usually
devoid
of
clinical
significance
is
certainly
calculated
to
frighten
timid
patients
who
read
of
the
terrible
ravages
of
bright
in
the
advertisements
of
various
popular
kidney
cures
to
prove
that
the
precipitate
is
phosphatic
in
its
nature
add
a
few
drops
of
vinegar
and
it
will
disappear
whilst
if
after
the
vinegar
has
been
added
the
specimen
be
brought
to
the
boiling
point
not
only
both
the
urates
and
phosphates
remain
in
solution
but
there
is
only
one
single
substance
known
to
pathological
chemistry
that
can
form
a
deposit
under
these
conditions
and
that
substance
is
albumen
which
if
present
in
quantity
is
always
indicative
of
serious
disease
the
papers
are
filled
with
the
plausible
but
unwarranted
statements
of
the
manufacturers
of
various
kidney
cures
who
anxiously
desire
that
every
one
should
be
impressed
with
the
idea
that
all
their
troubles
arise
from
kidney
disease
in
order
to
sell
large
quantities
of
their
medicines
in
many
cases
the
unfortunate
patient
is
rendered
much
worse
by
the
use
of
remedies
that
are
not
suited
to
his
condition
and
which
will
not
cure
the
real
trouble
with
which
he
is
affected
daily
we
are
consulted
by
persons
in
whose
cases
these
errors
have
been
made
in
reality
true
bright
disease
is
not
a
common
affection
and
nine
out
often
individuals
who
think
that
they
suffer
from
it
or
the
early
stages
of
the
trouble
in
fact
have
something
more
curable
in
some
cases
it
is
an
affection
of
the
liver
which
forces
an
excretion
of
unnatural
salts
by
the
kidneys
and
thus
renders
the
urine
acrid
and
irritating
or
they
may
be
suffering
from
some
other
disease
such
as
a
deformity
or
enlargement
of
certain
glands
as
the
prostate
unnatural
position
of
the
organs
as
with
women
who
suffer
from
weakness
the
uterus
pressing
forward
on
the
bladder
and
urethra
and
thus
showing
every
evidence
of
disease
in
the
urinary
canal
it
is
as
common
for
persons
to
suffer
from
deformity
of
the
urinary
canal
as
from
misshapen
limbs
or
from
noses
and
ears
not
of
proper
size
and
proportion
the
urinary
canal
from
the
bladder
outward
is
narrow
and
delicate
any
disease
or
injury
therein
is
liable
to
result
in
gradual
contraction
which
may
be
manifested
long
years
after
the
cause
has
been
forgotten
or
has
disappeared
these
affections
to
the
inexperienced
or
the
physician
who
is
not
particularly
alert
and
cautious
in
his
diagnosis
are
liable
to
cause
error
and
he
will
pronounce
a
given
case
disease
when
in
reality
there
is
some
simple
cause
for
the
irritation
of
the
urinary
canal
and
the
pains
in
the
kidneys
all
of
which
frequently
result
from
a
slight
damming
up
of
the
flow
of
water
and
the
prevention
of
free
expulsion
from
the
system
of
the
salts
of
which
the
body
is
relieved
by
the
kidneys
they
can
not
work
under
pressure
when
from
any
cause
the
flow
of
water
is
checked
and
as
it
were
dammed
up
so
that
a
slight
pressure
is
put
upon
the
kidneys
below
their
secretion
is
most
materially
interfered
with
and
the
many
trains
of
symptoms
that
usher
in
disease
of
the
kidneys
appear
the
true
and
only
sure
way
to
relieve
these
conditions
as
can
be
understood
by
any
one
is
to
remove
the
real
cause
the
use
of
any
medicine
that
stimulates
the
kidneys
to
an
irritable
action
under
such
pressure
is
to
be
avoided
as
it
only
makes
the
trouble
worse
increases
the
amount
of
water
that
is
dammed
up
and
results
in
more
serious
manifestations
of
constitutional
disease
whereas
by
merely
relieving
the
choked
outlet
the
flow
of
water
becomes
free
and
the
kidneys
are
speedily
restored
to
their
natural
condition
this
is
well
illustrated
by
the
following
case
as
recorded
at
the
invalids
hotel
farmer
age
married
for
a
period
of
nearly
ten
years
as
a
result
of
slight
injury
he
had
suffered
from
cloudy
and
water
with
some
burning
on
passing
it
frequent
calls
to
urinate
swelling
of
the
limbs
loss
of
energy
and
strength
headache
etc
gradually
there
appeared
severe
pain
in
the
back
at
times
recurring
with
a
sense
of
fullness
in
the
abdomen
for
a
period
of
nearly
eight
years
he
had
been
constantly
treated
by
physicians
at
his
home
all
of
whom
had
investigated
his
case
he
had
made
several
long
journeys
to
consult
the
manufacturers
of
a
kidney
cure
who
after
pretending
to
examine
his
urine
scientifically
none
of
the
proprietors
are
physicians
assured
him
that
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
his
disease
was
bright
and
that
he
might
be
cured
by
their
kidney
cure
which
was
for
sale
at
all
drug
stores
for
a
period
of
eighteen
months
he
steadily
took
this
cure
which
he
states
he
is
sure
aggravated
his
disease
as
although
his
sufferings
at
times
were
less
he
felt
that
he
was
not
improving
in
the
least
and
that
his
disorder
was
not
being
properly
controlled
his
home
physician
went
with
him
on
several
occasions
consulted
with
the
owner
of
the
proprietary
medicine
and
was
equally
mistaken
in
his
diagnosis
after
consulting
many
doctors
all
of
whom
assured
him
they
could
give
him
treatment
that
would
prolong
his
life
somewhat
and
make
his
condition
comfortable
but
that
no
treatment
would
affect
his
cure
he
was
induced
by
reading
our
article
heretofore
referred
to
to
consult
us
a
very
thorough
examination
of
the
case
was
made
which
resulted
in
finding
two
contractions
of
the
urethra
which
admitted
only
the
smallest
sized
probe
and
which
necessarily
prevented
the
free
flow
of
the
urine
these
were
speedily
removed
when
much
to
the
surprise
of
his
family
physician
who
accompanied
him
over
ounces
of
fluid
were
drawn
from
the
bladder
this
gave
him
immediate
and
perfect
relief
the
pains
and
aches
in
the
region
of
the
kidneys
the
weakness
and
tenderness
and
the
many
other
uncomfortable
symptoms
with
which
he
was
troubled
all
disappeared
from
a
feeble
and
irritable
invalid
in
a
few
weeks
he
was
converted
into
a
happy
and
cheerful
man
the
symptoms
of
congestion
and
irritability
of
the
kidneys
gradually
disappeared
and
in
thirty
days
after
visiting
us
he
writes
that
he
feels
himself
entirely
sound
and
well
this
gentleman
states
that
he
will
be
pleased
to
correspond
with
any
one
who
wishes
to
learn
the
particulars
of
his
case
and
his
full
name
and
address
will
be
furnished
to
any
inquirer
bright
disease
when
fully
established
is
characterized
by
degeneration
of
the
kidneys
submitted
to
examination
after
death
by
this
disease
these
organs
present
various
appearances
hence
the
degeneration
that
characterizes
the
disease
has
been
designated
as
waxy
degeneration
some
pathologists
contend
that
the
disease
consists
of
several
different
renal
maladies
all
of
which
however
agree
in
the
one
symptom
of
a
more
or
less
albuminous
condition
of
the
urine
as
to
the
causes
of
kidney
disease
it
may
be
said
that
any
thing
which
will
give
rise
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
of
congestion
of
the
kidney
will
induce
either
a
temporary
albuminous
condition
of
the
urine
or
a
true
bright
disease
of
the
kidneys
suppression
of
perspiration
by
exposure
to
cold
and
wet
want
of
cleanliness
deficiency
of
nutritious
diet
liver
disease
certain
poisons
in
the
system
as
of
scarlet
fever
measles
erysipelas
or
diphtheria
taken
in
conjunction
with
sedentary
habits
bad
air
excessive
mental
labor
or
worry
may
each
occasion
an
albuminous
urine
and
finally
result
in
bright
disease
but
of
all
causes
that
appear
to
produce
this
disease
none
are
so
prolific
as
intemperance
a
scrofulous
diathesis
or
habit
of
body
may
strongly
predispose
to
the
disease
and
chronic
kidney
disease
frequently
follows
acute
rheumatism
and
the
practice
of
masturbation
in
some
instances
the
chronic
form
of
bright
disease
follows
an
acute
attack
but
is
more
often
developed
slowly
and
insidiously
without
any
known
cause
the
symptoms
of
this
fatal
malady
generally
appear
so
gradually
that
they
excite
but
little
or
no
concern
until
it
has
reached
its
more
advanced
and
dangerous
stages
frequently
a
puffy
watery
or
flabby
condition
of
the
face
particularly
under
the
eyes
is
the
first
symptom
noticed
and
the
patient
may
observe
that
his
urine
is
diminished
in
quantity
the
urine
is
sometimes
abundant
but
generally
more
scanty
than
in
health
is
acid
in
its
reaction
and
generally
of
a
low
specific
gravity
the
countenance
is
generally
somewhat
pale
and
bloodless
which
taken
with
the
dropsical
condition
of
the
system
and
the
constant
albuminous
condition
of
the
urine
points
the
expert
specialist
to
bright
disease
of
the
kidneys
various
circumstances
and
conditions
may
give
rise
to
the
temporary
presence
of
albumen
in
the
urine
and
although
albumen
may
be
temporarily
absent
from
the
urine
even
when
bright
disease
exists
yet
this
is
not
common
there
are
certain
indirect
symptoms
which
point
clearly
and
almost
unmistakably
to
the
presence
of
this
disease
these
are
pain
or
weakness
in
the
back
gradual
loss
of
flesh
red
brown
or
dingy
urine
more
or
less
drowsiness
and
as
the
disease
advances
a
smothering
sensation
or
difficulty
in
breathing
with
dropsical
puffiness
or
swelling
occasional
attacks
of
nausea
and
vomiting
are
common
pains
in
the
limbs
and
loins
which
are
often
mistaken
for
rheumatism
irregularity
of
the
bowels
is
also
common
the
skin
becomes
harsh
and
dry
not
perspiring
even
under
active
exercise
sometimes
these
symptoms
are
years
in
their
development
being
very
obscure
at
first
and
in
some
cases
the
disease
has
been
known
to
prove
fatal
without
the
patient
having
experienced
any
extraordinary
symptoms
with
those
whose
systems
are
enfeebled
by
want
intemperance
exposures
or
disease
as
scrofula
or
syphilis
the
first
symptoms
usually
observed
will
be
a
frequent
desire
to
urinate
occasional
attacks
of
diarrhea
flatulency
dropsical
swelling
of
the
face
especially
under
the
eyes
and
afterwards
of
the
extremities
paleness
and
increasing
debility
stupor
apoplexy
and
convulsions
are
the
forerunners
of
a
fatal
termination
microscopical
and
chemical
examinations
of
the
urine
are
the
only
reliable
means
of
diagnosis
and
should
be
often
repeated
see
urinary
signs
in
appendix
as
albumen
is
often
present
in
the
urine
without
the
existence
of
bright
disease
it
is
impossible
except
by
the
aid
of
the
microscope
to
distinguish
true
bright
from
other
affections
of
the
kidneys
in
both
purulent
urine
and
that
containing
blood
albumen
will
be
found
by
the
usual
tests
but
in
smaller
quantity
than
in
bright
disease
albumen
with
disintegrated
epithelia
hyaline
and
large
granular
casts
as
well
as
waxy
casts
are
peculiar
to
and
characteristic
of
this
disease
in
the
treatment
of
this
malady
our
specialist
experience
has
been
very
great
and
attended
with
marvelous
success
of
course
after
the
substance
of
the
kidney
has
degenerated
and
broken
down
and
become
destroyed
to
any
great
extent
a
cure
is
impossible
but
that
we
now
possess
remedies
of
great
value
and
specific
power
over
this
terrible
disease
we
have
the
most
positive
evidence
in
the
remarkable
success
attended
in
its
treatment
most
cases
that
are
curable
can
be
managed
successfully
at
a
distance
the
necessary
medicines
being
sent
either
by
mail
or
express
our
specialists
have
cured
many
in
this
way
who
were
so
bloated
from
dropsical
effusion
as
to
weigh
to
forty
pounds
more
than
usual
in
our
sanitarium
where
we
have
had
the
advantage
of
our
turkish
baths
and
other
appliances
we
have
cured
some
cases
in
which
the
removal
of
the
dropsical
effusion
reduced
the
patient
weight
sixty
pounds
we
can
not
in
conclusion
too
strongly
condemn
the
general
resort
to
strong
diuretics
so
often
prescribed
by
physicians
for
all
forms
of
renal
maladies
but
which
by
the
already
weak
and
delicate
kidneys
only
aggravate
and
render
incurable
thousands
of
cases
annually
not
less
harmful
are
the
many
advertised
kidney
cures
kidney
remedies
buchus
and
kindred
preparations
they
all
contain
powerful
stimulating
diuretics
and
while
they
may
appear
for
a
short
time
to
do
good
invariably
render
the
case
worse
and
far
more
difficult
to
cure
the
cases
of
bright
disease
reported
cured
by
these
preparations
are
cases
of
far
less
dangerous
maladies
made
to
appear
by
exaggerated
accounts
of
them
as
true
bright
disease
the
use

frequently
we
find
these
gravelly
formations
as
the
result
of
a
rheumatic
or
a
gouty
diathesis
it
is
also
a
fact
that
torpidity
of
the
liver
throws
an
excessive
amount
of
work
on
the
kidneys
these
organs
then
in

perform
the
function
of

hence
unnatural
activity
is
required
of
them

the
cutting
operation
heretofore

remove
it
is
considered
one
of
the
most
dangerous
operations
that
the
surgeon
is
ever
called
upon
to
perform
the

of
the
emperor
louis
napoleon
of
france
from
an
operation
for
the
removal
of
a
stone
at
the
hands
of
surgeons
renowned
for
their
skill
gave
new
impetus
to
the
efforts
of
surgeons
to
invent
some
method
that
would
be
less
dangerous
than
that
which
has
been
heretofore
commonly
employed
the
cutting
operations
have
been
the
rule
of
these
the
operation
by
is
the
safest
and
is
most
commonly
employed
for
the
removal
of
stones
that
are
not
too
large
while
the
lateral
operation
is
used
where
the
stone
is
more
than
about
one
inch
in
its
smallest
diameter
as
will
be
seen
by
the
consultation
of
any
hospital
record
the
deaths
in
these
various
operations
have
been
in
adults
from
one
in
three
to
one
in
every
four
cases
a
very
large
percentage
and
sufficient
to
deter
any
sufferer
from
undergoing
an
operation
except
for
the
relief
of
a
condition
which
is
in
itself
worse
than
death
even
when
this
alarming
is
explained
to
sufferers
they
willingly
undergo
the
operation
feeling
that
they
would
rather
die
than
longer
continue
in
their
pain
and
anguish
our
specialists
not
satisfied
with
the
results
of
these
operative
measures
in
their
studies
of
the
disease
endeavored
to
perfect
some
other
means
by
which
these
foreign
bodies
could
be
removed
from
the
bladder
without
such
great
danger
and
pain
the
operation
by
crushing
and
removal
without
cutting
appeared
to
them
to
present
the
most
practicable
advantages
and
they
therefore
devote
their
entire
time
to
the
improvement
of
this
method
for
the
removal
of
stone
the
method
of
crushing
was
first
invented
by
a
french
surgeon
many
years
ago
but
owing
to
his
crude
instruments
and
the
difficulty
that
was
experienced
in
expelling
the
pieces
of
stone
the
operation
was
seldom
employed
by
surgeons
the
improvements
in
these
methods
at
the
hands
of
bigelow
and
sir
henry
thompson
with
those
that
have
been
made
by
our
specialists
have
resulted
in
our
being
able
to
present
to
sufferers
with
this
disease
a
means
of
cure
which
is
we
are
assured
the
most
successful
known
to
modern
medical
science
there
have
been
so
far
in
the
history
of
the
treatment
of
this
malady
by
the
new
method
of
cure
one
hundred
and
cases
operated
upon
at
the
hands
of
prominent
surgeons
all
of
which
were
with
less
perfect
methods
than
that
of
our
specialists
and
there
were
but
four
deaths
in
this
large
number
by
the
advantages
which
are
the
result
of
further
improvements
by
our
specialists
we
can
assure
you
that
this
mortality
is
even
less
in
our
hands
in
fact
approaches
as
near
as
possible
to
a
perfect
method
of
cure
we
think
that
in
a
moderately
healthy
subject
one
in
which
the
kidneys
are
not
badly
diseased
as
the
result
of
irritation
from
the
calculus
the
operation
is
almost
absolutely
safe
the
method
consists
in
the
crushing
of
the
stone
and
its
removal
from
the
bladder
by
means
of
small
silver
catheters
attached
to
an
apparatus
which
gently
and
perfectly
removes
by
suction
all
the
pieces
which
are
thrown
to
the
bottom
of
the
bladder
this
operation
has
now
been
performed
in
our
institution
in
a
very
large
number
of
cases
with
uniform
success
and
the
cures
have
been
effected
in
from
six
to
eight
weeks
without
a
single
unpleasant
symptom
arising
during
their
progress
by
this
method
it
is
not
necessary
to
remove
the
entire
calculus
at
one
operation
if
it
is
a
large
one
by
the
old
cutting
operation
this
was
required
as
the
bleeding
was
great
and
what
was
to
be
done
had
to
be
done
immediately
or
the
patient
would
die
from
the
with
the
new
method
a
part
of
the
large
calculus
or
when
several
exist
one
or
two
of
them
may
be
removed
at
a
time
after
which
the
patient
can
rest
and
gain
strength
for
the
second
or
if
necessary
for
the
third
operation
the
largest
stone
removed
by
us
in
this
way
was
one
weighing
between
seven
and
eight
hundred
grains
for
which
three
operations
were
required
it
is
necessarily
performed
under
a
mild
anæsthetic
which
prevents
suffering
and
secures
the
perfect
relaxation
of
the
patient
in
the
case
in
which
this
large
amount
of
stone
was
removed
we
feel
certain
that
a
cure
could
not
possibly
have
resulted
from
a
cutting
operation
as
the
heart
was
seriously
affected
and
the
physical
condition
of
the
patient
so
low
as
the
result
of
years
of
suffering
that
death
would
have
occurred
while
undergoing
the
operation
by
carefully
pursuing
the
new
method
and
not
prolonging
the
sittings
more
than
a
few
minutes
each
time
the
entire
stone
was
evacuated
the
health
of
the
patient
constantly
improved
during
the
interval
of
three
operations
which
covered
a
space
of
seven
weeks
this
stone
was
as
large
as
a
hen
egg
small
calculi
or
gravel
are
readily
removed
in
a
few
moments

by
the
new
method

no
case
is
there

bleeding
instead
of
a
large
gaping
wound

left
after
the
operation
from
which
secondary
hemorrhage
may
take

removed

commonly
followed

the

of
a

or
even
to
the
size
of
an
orange
hypertrophy
of
the

generally
arises
from
causes
which
operate
in
a
slow
and
permanent
manner
whatever
has
a
tendency
to
produce
a
determination
of
blood
to
and
an
engorgement
of
this
organ
is
capable
of
producing
the
affection
an
augmented
flow
of
blood
to
the
the
part
having
the
effect
to
increase
the
nutrition
among
the
most
frequent
causes
of
this
affection
are
excessive
venery
masturbation
disease
of
the
bladder
stricture
of
the
urethra
horseback
exercise
gonorrhea
and
the
employment
of
strong
stimulating
diuretics
some
of
the
worst
cases
that
we
have
had
to
deal
with
have
occurred
in
old
men
and
in
fact
the
malady
is
more
common
to
those
advanced
in
life
but
it
is
frequently
produced
in
those
of
middle
age
by
the
causes
enumerated
among
the
earliest
symptoms
of
the
disease
is
an
uneasy
feeling
in
the
region
of
the
base
of
the
bladder
there
is
a
more
frequent
desire
to
urinate
than
usual
and
in
the
course
of
time
this
frequency
becomes
more
urgent
still
no
particular
notice
may
be
taken
of
it
it
being
considered
as
only
a
slight
inconvenience
after
several
months
or
it
may
be
years
the
discomfort
increases
and
nightly
calls
to
empty
the
bladder
become
habitual
by
and
by
the
patient
begins
to
find
the
discomfort
of
getting
out
of
his
warm
bed
very
troublesome
still
no
notice
to
taken
of
it
he
does
not
consider
it
worth
his
while
to
consult
a
doctor
for
such
a
trifle
in
the
course
of
time
the
patient
is
obliged
to
get
out
of
bed
twice
during
the
night
instead
of
once
afterwards
the
calls
become
still
more
frequent
and
urgent
the
inconvenience
more
evident
finally
pain
is
substituted
for
inconvenience
and
then
the
doctor
is
consulted
unless
a
specialist
of
experience
be
consulted
the
bladder
will
most
probably
be
examined
and
medicine
will
be
prescribed
only
to
excite
the
kidneys
to
secrete
more
urine
which
does
harm
instead
of
good
the
disease
slowly
but
surely
progressing
patients
often
write
us
that
they
have
had
something
wrong
with
the
bladder
for
a
number
of
years
having
to
urinate
more
frequently
than
they
ought
sometimes
having
to
do
so
three
and
four
times
during
the
night
in
extreme
cases
even
every
half
hour
or
so
and
that
they
are
not
able
to
pass
it
freely
but
only
in
small
quantities
and
attended
with
much
pain
these
symptoms
are
not
always
constant
but
let
up
for
a
few
weeks
and
then
appear
again
things
go
on
in
this
way
for
a
year
or
two
perhaps
when
the
passage
of
the
urine
is
completely
shut
off
for
several
hours
and
the
patient
is
in
great
agony
until
the
bladder
is
relieved
by
the
use
of
the
catheter
after
such
instrumental
relief
for
a
day
or
two
the
urine
may
be
natural
again
coming
at
first
perhaps
in
very
small
quantities
but
by
and
by
more
freely
then
after
a
week
or
two
intervening
there
may
be
another
complete
stoppage
attended
as
before
with
intense
suffering
which
will
have
to
be
again
relieved
by
the
use
of
an
instrument
the
foregoing
is
a
fair
account
of
the
usual
progress
of
the
disease
and
its
symptoms
as
the
prostate
gland
becomes
more
irritated
and
inflamed
from
the
natural
progress
of
the
disease
or
from
the
irritation
caused
by
the
passage
of
instruments
or
the
employment
of
strong
harsh
stimulating
diuretics
the
urine
becomes
cloudy
and
still
later
is
found
to
have
deposited
during
the
night
in
the
chamber
utensil
a
quantity
of
thick
tenacious
and
usually
offensive
mucus
there
is
apt
to
be
more
or
less
discomfort
in
the
rectum
or
lower
bowel
produced
by
the
pressure
of
the
enlarged
prostate
upon
it
rarely
the
first
intimation
of
a
large
prostate
occurs
through
a
sudden
retention
of
the
urine
and
the
patient
being
under
the
impression
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
organ
previously
closely
questioned
however
the
information
is
elicited
that
there
has
been
a
long
train
of
mild
symptoms
similar
to
those
that
we
have
described
preceding
the
attack
of
retention
of
the
urine
this
shows
the
importance
of
early
attention
and
proper
treatment
when
such
symptoms
are
manifested
however
slight
the
inconvenience
experienced
it
should
not
be
neglected
the
disease
should
be
brought
under
control
at
the
outset
by
skillful
and
treatment
usually
before
a
person
suffers
from
toothache
the
decay
occasioning
it
has
been
gradually
progressing
without
pain
for
from
five
to
eight
years
just
as
the
decay
of
the
tooth
may
be
arrested
by
the
early
attention
of
the
dentist
so
may
prostatic
disease
by
early
attention
be
not
only
promptly
relieved
but
permanently
cured
disease
of
the
prostate
being
slow
in
its
inception
and
progress
is
also
slow
to
yield
even
to
the
most
skillful
treatment
being
slow
to
develop
patients
rarely
seek
assistance
until
the
organ
has
become
so
large
as
to
be
seldom
restorable
to
a
size
where
mechanical
means
can
be
wholly
dispensed
with
for
relieving
the
bladder
most
surgeons
are
too
much
in
the
habit
of
depending
on
the
catheter
for
the
relief
of
the
patient
and
usually
instruct
the
sufferer
how
to
use
it
telling
them
that
this
the
catheter
is
to
be
their
only
doctor
for
life
great
as
is
the
relief
afforded
by
the
catheter
which
has
often
saved
life
yet
it
is
a
fact
that
its
frequent
and
prolonged
use
often
renders
disease
of
the
prostate
very
intractable
and
often
wholly
incurable
frequent
use
of
the
catheter
without
any
treatment
to
prevent
the
further
enlargement
of
the
diseased
gland
or
to
reduce
its
size
permits
the
part
to
go
on
enlarging
and
besides
the
constant
use
of
the
catheter
irritates
the
prostatic
portion
of
the
urethra
causing
thickening
of
the
lining
membrane
and
sooner
or
later
a
more
or
less
complete
organic
stricture
of
this
canal
depending
upon
thickening
of
the
lining
mucous
membrane
as
well
as
upon
the
encroachment
of
the
gland
itself
upon
this
canal
besides
when
the
use
of
the
catheter
is
once
commenced
even
when
the
enlargement
is
not
very
great
it
is
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
we
have
been
able
to
induce
patients
to
leave
off
its
use
the
bladder
becoming
accustomed
to
its
use
refuses
to
obey
the
will
without
this
help
the
irritation
set
up
in
the
parts
by
the
friction
of
the
catheter
causes
inflammation
and
exudation
in
the
lining
membrane
this
extends
to
the
structure
of
the
prostate
itself
and
increases
the
hypertrophy
or
enlargement
it
will
therefore
be
seen
how
important
it
is
to
early
resort
to
treatment
to
relieve
the
first
manifestations
of
this
affection
a
disease
of
so
delicate
a
nature
and
one
so
often
confounded
with
other
maladies
by
inexperienced
physicians
should
only
be
intrusted
for
treatment
to
expert
specialists
of
large
experience

the
management
of

stricture
of
the
urethra
stricture
of
the
urethra
generally
results
from
some
specific
disease
of
the
urethra
but
may
be
caused
by
sexual
excesses
exposure
or
strain
or
by
the
practice
of
masturbation
or
it
runs
a
course
varying
in
time
from
a
few
days
to
many
weeks
or
months
during
which
time
the
patient
is
often
unaware
of
the
real
cause
of
his
sufferings
commonly
the
attention
is
first
called
to
a
stricture
by
a
slight
discharge
or
smarting
sensation
or
the
appearance
of
an
undue
amount
of
mucous
deposit
in
the
urine
occasionally
some
difficulty
in
starting
the
water
or
a
diminution
in
the
size
and
force
or
a
twisting
of
the
stream
as
it
flows
is
the
first
symptom
this
passive

of
the
disease
a
speedy
cure
is
easily
effected
without

or
danger
any
exposure
improper
use
of
instruments
or
irritating
cause
may
speedily
give
rise
to
the
alarming

fatal
consequences
may
suddenly
ensue

the
hard
and
tough
stricture
which
surrounds
the
soft
mucous
membrane
that
lines
the
urinary
canal
when
irritated
or
inflamed
as
the
result
of
a
cold
or
other
cause
the
mucous
membrane
becomes
swollen
and
thickened
and
as
the
stricture
will
not
yield
and
enlarge
the
result
is
that
the
urethra
is
almost
completely
closed
and
it
becomes
impossible
to
pass
the
urine
great
pain
is
experienced
and
the
surgeon
has
to
be
called
to
draw
off
the
urine
with
a
catheter
which
at
best
is
a
very
difficult
and
painful
operation
when
the
urethra
is
so
irritable
and
constricted

in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
malady
relief
is
given
by
the
skillful
use
of
instruments
for
dilating
the

where
this
fails
by
the
operation
of
urethrotomy

which
we
employ

our
surgeons
have
operated
upon

hundreds
of
bad
cases
by
a
very
ingenious
and
almost
painless
method
that
requires
no
use
of
bougies
in
the
this
saves
the
patient
an
immense
amount
of
pain
and
annoyance
and
enables
him
to
go
home
almost
immediately
after
the
operation
the
ordinary
by
dilatation
with
bougies
is
very
tedious
and
often
more
painful
than
the

itself

spermatorrhea
not
infrequently
results
from
stricture
of
the
urethra
even
when
the
affection
is
quite
slight
our
attention
was
first
called
to
this
subject
by
the
consideration
of
the
numerous
cases
in
which
epileptic
convulsions
or
fits
and
other
serious
diseases
of
the
nervous
system
in
children
have
resulted
from
an
unnatural
contraction
of
the
prepuce
or
foreskin
constituting
what
is
termed
every
surgeon
of
experience
has
met
with
many
of
these
cases
of
reflex
irritation
it
occurred
to
us
that
inasmuch
as
these
contractions
of
the
foreskin
give
rise
to
nervous
diseases
of
an
alarming
nature
may
not
an
unnatural
narrowing
of
the
urethral
canal
which
must
have
exactly
the
same
effect
in
retarding
the
flow
of
the
urine
give
rise
to
irritable
nervous
affections
in
adults
may
not
unnatural
irritation
and
excitement
of
the
sexual
organs
so
set
up
cause
loss
of
semen
to
occur
during
sleep
and
consequent
nervous
and
general
debility
it
is
a
well
recognized
fact
that
the
urethral
canal
should
bear
a
certain
definite
and
proportionate
size
to
that
of
the
penis
just
as
the
length
of
the
arm
should
naturally
bear
a
certain
proportion
to
the
length
of
the
body
in
the
case
of
some
parts
of
the
body
disproportionate
development
of
the
part
may
not
give
rise
to
anything
further
than
unsightliness
but
when
we
find
the
small
size
of
the
urethra
retarding
the
free
passage
of
the
urine
then
we
may
expect
if
this
condition
is
long
continued
to
find
more
or
less
irritation
of
the
urethra
and
perhaps
of
the
bladder
also
when
there
is
a
contraction
of
the
urethra
at
its
external
orifice
or
at
any
point
along
its
course
unnatural
pressure
is
put
upon
the
urinary
canal
behind
the
constricted
portion
and
these
parts
must
bear
an
undue
strain
during
the
passage
of
the
urine
it
is
a
well
established
fact
that
improper
diet
cold
exposure
and
exert
a
very
powerful
modifying
influence
upon
the
urinary
secretion
frequently
causing
an
acrid
and
irritating
condition
of
this
fluid
this
condition
when
associated
with
a
contracted
urethra
must
result
in
irritation
of
the
mucous
membrane
lining
this
canal
back
of
the
stricture
if
long
continued
or
frequently
repeated
as
an
illustration
we
have
a
hose
pipe
from
which
by
means
of
a
small
nozzle
water
is
expelled
a
considerable
distance
but
a
great
tension
is
put
upon
the
hose
behind
the
nozzle
if
the
pressure
is
increased
greatly
the
hose
will
burst
but
if
the
small
nozzle
be
replaced
with
a
larger
one
the
projection
of
the
stream
will
be
quite
as
great
but
all
undue
tension
of
the
pipe
is
overcome
and
the
danger
of
bursting
is
done
away
with
we
have
in
an
unnaturally
contracted
urethra
a
favorable
condition
for
the
development
of
disease
in
the
urinary
canal
and
adjacent
parts
of
the
generative
organs
irritation
is
set
up
in
the
urethra
behind
the
stricture
by
undue
strain
in
passing
water
and
the
frequent
reoccurrence
of
acrid
urine
as
the
result
of
any
of
the
causes
we
have
already
mentioned
this
irritation
keeps
gradually
increasing
it
will
be
felt
more
during
the
periods
when
the
urine
is
acrid
but
may
pass
unnoticed
even
at
such
times
the
seminal
sacs
and
the
prostate
and
cowper
glands
communicate
with
the
deeper
portions
of
the
urethra
by
means
of
canals
or
ducts
lined
with
mucous
membrane
which
is
continuous
with
the
urethral
mucous
membrane
hence
we
can
readily
see
that
not
only
by
reflex
nervous
irritation
are
those
parts
debilitated
through
the
contraction
of
the
urethra
but
the
affection
is
apt
to
extend
by
continuity
of
the
mucous
membrane
and
thus
become
more
and
more
manifest
through
symptoms
of
disease
of
the
testicles
prostate
gland
and
seminal
vesicles
and
these
disorders
become
more
and
more
seated
the
longer
the
morbid
condition
of
the
urethra
is
allowed
to
run
on
until
there
may
be
an
entire
loss

the
sexual
functions
occurring
at
an
age
when
there
should
be
present

most
vigorous
manhood
from
no

we
explain

common
prevalence
of

confounded
with

applied
to

from

loss
of
the
sexual
function
with
great
nervous
debility
and
there
was
a
thin
slimy
discharge
from
the
urethra
and
the
usual
symptoms
of
melancholia
and
weakness
he
had
lost
all
taste
for
business
and
was
extremely
nervous
from
the
fact
that
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
and
felt
that
his
condition
would
not
permit
it
on
examination
a
contraction
of
the
urethra

found
at
the
point
shown
in

hence
the
true

his
trouble
had
not
been
suspected
with
the
removal
of

was
an
immediate
improvement
in

and
more
rapid

his
system
gained
strength
and
reaction
became
manifest
at
the
end
of
two
months
he
wrote
that
he
felt
sound

that

behooves
one
suffering
from
this
malady
to
have
it
promptly
and
skillfully
treated
false
passages
in
very
rare
cases
of
impassable
stricture
or
in
which
fistulous
openings
or
false
passages
have
formed
through
which
the
urine
flows
or
dribbles
away
we
have
resorted
to
the
operation
of
perineal
section
with
the
most
gratifying
results
the
cases
requiring
this
operation
are
rare
ones
in
which
death
must
generally
result
but
for
the
relief
afforded
by
the
operation
dangerous
use
of
instruments
the
worst
and
most
dangerous
cases
of
stricture
with
which
we
have
met
in
a
long
and
extensive
experience
were
rendered
thus
by
the
careless
or
unskillful
use
of
bougies
catheters
or
sounds
many
surgeons
and
physicians
are
most
recklessly
careless
or
unskilled
in
the
use
of
these
most
dangerous
instruments
as
the
many
cases
of
false
passage
or
stricture
of
the
most
painful
and
dangerous
kind
caused
or
aggravated
by
their
ignorant
or
improper
use
sorrowfully
testify
delay
dangerous
by
proper
treatment
of
stricture
in
its
early
stages
all
danger
and
pain
are
avoided
and
a
cure
is
effected
in
a
very
short
time
in
an
extensive
practice
in
which
we
yearly
treat
hundreds
of
cases
we
have
never
yet
failed
to
give
perfect
and
permanent
relief
from
stricture
or
diseased
prostate
or
urethra
without
the
necessity
of
cutting
instruments
of
any
kind
when
we
have
been
consulted
before
injury
of
the
urethra
has
been
produced
by
improper
use
of
instruments
having
specialists
who
devote
their
entire
time
to
the
study
and
cure
of
these
diseases
we
are
thereby
enabled
to
attain
the
highest
degree
of
skill
in
the
management
of
these
cases
great
skill
required
the
urethra
is
a
sensitive
and
delicate
canal
and
is
surrounded
by
tissues
the
most
delicate
and
lined
with
mucous
membrane
which
is
highly
vascular
and
filled
with
sensitive
nerves
the
introduction
of
any
instrument
is
to
be
undertaken
only
when
absolutely
required
and
when
necessary
it
should
be
so
skillfully
and
carefully
effected
that
no
pain
or
irritation
can
result
the
slightest
awkwardness
is
liable
to
cause
an
unnoticeable
injury
which
results
in
false
passage
or
an
effusion
of
plastic
lymph
around
the
canal
and
as
it
organizes
the
formation
of
the
most
troublesome
organic
stricture
the
attention
not
only
of
sufferers
but
also
of
the
profession
is
called
to
the
remarkable
success
of
our
operation
perineal
section
by
which
a
cure
of
extremely
bad
cases
of
impassable
stricture
and
false
passages
or
urinary
fistulas
is
effected
in
from
thirty
to
forty
days
and
with
very
little
suffering
that
we
have
been
successful
in
such
cases
must
be
considered
as
conclusive
evidence
that
no
case
of
stricture
false
passage
or
urinary
fistula
is
beyond
the
reach
of
our
skill
testimonials
in
a
practice
embracing
the
treatment
of
a
vast
number
of
cases
of
diseases
of
the
urinary
organs
it
has
been
our
good
fortune
to
effect
many
remarkable
cures
the
experience
gained
in
this
field
of
practice
has
made
our
specialists
skilled
experts
and
hence
hundreds
consult
them
as
a
last
resort
in
fact
we
seldom
get
a
case
in
this
line
that
has
not
been
the
rounds
of
the
home
physicians
before
applying
to
us
for
relief
and
cure
the
cures
therefore
which
we
shall
introduce
here
are
the
more
remarkable
because
of
the
failure
in
nearly
every
case
of
other
medical
men
to
benefit
or
cure
they
are
not
the
ordinary
cases
met
with

complicated
obstinate
ones

i

it
my
duty
to
write
to
you
concerning
my
case
in
the
year
i
was
seized
with
inflammation
of
the
bladder
and
passed
nothing
but
thick
blood
owing
to
heavy
work
and
i
consulted
a
doctor
and
he
said
there
was
no
cure
for
such
a
bad
case
but
he
gave
me
medicine
and
it
relieved
me
at
the
time
i
used
it
and
i
took
bottles
and
i
got
worse
and
wasted
to
a
shadow
i
quit
taking
the
medicine
and
other
complaints
came
as
rupture
in
the
spermatic
cord
for
which
i
applied
to
you
and
soon
got
relief
and
in
the

disease
made
its
appearance
and
i
wrote
to
the
invalids
hotel

institute
and
got
no
reply
as
our
mails
were
stopped
on
account
of
snow

i
sent
for
the
best
doctor
in
listowell
and
i
still
got
worse
and
he
said
i
might
live
three
or
four
weeks
but
there
was
no
stoppage
of
the
disease
and
i
got
so
weak
that
i
had
to
support
myself
by
the
furniture
in
my
room
and
i
wasted
down
to
lbs
in
two
weeks
and
i
applied
to
your
institute
and
i
received
my
medicine
in
a
few
days
and
in
two
weeks
i
began
to
gather
strength
and
now
i
am
hearty
and
well
and
my
weight
is
lbs
i
feel
so
thankful
to
the
medical
association
and
its
staff
of
skilled
men
it
is
months
since
i
quit
taking
your

excruciating
agony
i

discharged

that
my

we
must
have
a

at

they
were
both
cheerful

daily
brought
your

to
my
notice
though
i
had
then
no

with

it
was
a
question
of
life

up

last

i
was
in
a
condition
of
unendurable
torture
i
knew
that
at
my
age
after
the
months
of
pain
already
borne
that
any
operation
would
be
serious
perhaps
fatal
accordingly
i
arranged
my
temporal
affairs
and
carefully
set
my
house
in
order
on
the
of
march
last
i
started
for
buffalo
to
your

still
uninformed
as
to
the

submitted
to
a
searching
examination
as

my

the
age

of
death
of
my
parents
and
other

from
which
a

could

prepared
all
was
kindly
intended
their
aim
was
to
locate
my
ailment
and
then
to
determine
my
ability
to
undergo
an
operation
having
found
a
stone
in
the
bladder
they
advised
that
it
be
crushed
and
extracted
by
a
strange
coincidence
as
this
was
announced
i
learned
of
elliott
shepard
death
under
an
operation
for
the

disease
he
was
many
years
my
junior
and
seemingly
far
better
able
to
undergo
the
operation
still
in
my
desperation
i
determined
to
go
on
during
five
days
i
was
under
treatment
for
the
coming
operation
on
the
of

the
stone
was
crushed

it
was
a
complete
success

the
consideration
tenderness
and
skill
of
the

his

suffered

everything

knowing
full

i
was
cured
of
a
chronic
trouble
that
had
been
maltreated
by

while
there
i
saw
a
man
who
had
been
cured

who
had
before
been
given
up
to
die
by
the
best

the

must
have
been
a
very
stubborn
one

saw
a

die

got
well
why
because
it
was
only
a

are
easily
cured

almost

i

state
that

years
of
age
that
about
seventeen
years
ago
i
fell
from
a
scaffold
a
distance
of
eighteen
feet
across
a
beam
striking
upon
the
perineum
a
physician
was
immediately
called
and
i
was
treated
by
him
for
about
eight
or
ten
weeks
a
catheter
was
introduced
into
the
bladder
but
caused
such
intense
pain
and
anguish
that
it
had
to
be
withdrawn
it
was
tried
again
but
could
not
be
introduced
on
account
of
the
lacerations
in
the
urethra
caused
by
the
violence
used
a
consultation
was
held
and
an
operation
recommended
an
anæsthetic
was
used
and
a
cut
made
through
the
perineum
from
the
outside
into
the
bladder
a
catheter
was
inserted
into
the
bladder
tied
in
place
and
left
in
position
for
about
eight
weeks
after
eight
or
nine
weeks
the
catheter
was
removed
but
it
was
four
or
five
weeks
before
the
wound
in
the
perineum
healed
after
a
few
months
i
began
to
have
a
urinary
difficulty
and
symptoms
of
urethral
stricture
this
condition
continued
until
the
urethra
was
entirely
closed
and
it
was
impossible
to
make
water
a
physician
attempted
to
pass
a
catheter
but
could
not
do
so
he
continued
to
treat
me
by
the
process
of
dilation
for
five
or
six
months
i
began
to
feel
more
comfortable
but
the
symptoms
of
stricture
would
manifest
themselves
again
i
then
went
to
a
hospital
at
toronto
there
i
was
treated
also
by
the
dilating
method
the
treatment
was
continued
for
about
four
weeks
but
became
so
very
painful
and
there
was
so
much
irritation
in
the
urethra
that
it
was
impossible
to
endure
it
longer
they
then
called
an
electrical
specialist
and
he
began
treatment
by
electrolysis
in
about
three
weeks
i
went
home
but
in
a
short
time
the
stricture
again
manifested
itself
the
contraction
was
very
marked
and
micturition
very
difficult
it
grew
gradually
worse
and
i
could
not
receive
any
comfort
or
benefit
i
returned
to
toronto
to
take
further
treatment
from
the
electrical
specialist
during
the
operations
of
dilation
of
the
urethra
i
passed
some
gravel
after
four
weeks
treatment
i
returned
home
but
in
about
two
months
was
as
bad
as
ever
and
last
october
went
back
to
toronto
and
was
again
treated
by
the
electrical
method
the
doctor
had
much
difficulty
in
inserting
the
smallest
catheter
and
it
caused
intense
pain
and
suffering
the
last
time
he
attempted
to
insert
a
catheter
there
seemed
to
be
something
give
way
and
a
large
amount
of
pus
and
fluid
passed
from
the
rectum
the
physician
told
me
an
abscess
had
formed
i
returned
home
and
tried
to
keep
as
comfortable
as
possible
but
could
not
micturate
with
any
degree
of
satisfaction
or
comfort
i
gradually
began
to
grow
worse
and
there
was
a
return
of
the
stricture
with
inflammation
of
the
bladder
in
march
there
began
to
be
formed
gravel
in
the
bladder
they
would
at
times
obstruct
the
flow
of
urine
entirely
i
kept
going
from
bad
to
worse
until
the
urethra
appeared
to
be
entirely
closed
the
physician
i
called
found
it
impossible
to
pass
a
catheter
into
the
bladder
and
advised
me
to
go
to
some
hospital
where
i
could
receive
proper
treatment
and
where
proper
appliances
for
this
class
of
cases
were
used
as
he
felt
satisfied
nothing
could
be
accomplished
for
me
at
home
i
then
came
to
the
invalids

in

to
receive

and
the
treatment
has
been
so
successful
that
the
urethral
stricture
as
well
as
the
gravel
have
been
removed
after
i
returned

i

a

lifted
from

i

this
is
to
certify
that
for
a
number
of
years
i
was
a
constant
sufferer
and
what
was
many
times
termed
a
hopeless
victim
of
that
terrible
disease
diabetes
the
symptoms
were
indeed
alarming
my
strength
being
so
completely
exhausted
that
my
walking
from

was
attended
with
difficulty
my
nerves
were
in
a
constant
tremor
and
in
fact
no
other

than
that
i
was
completely
out
of

all

express
my

having
purchased

and
in
looking
over
the

finding
my
own

so
thoroughly
described
i
decided
at
once
to
give
his
special

a
trial
which
i
did
during
the
three
months
that
followed
this
proved
to
be
all
that
was

for
the
restoration

during

four

since

i
have
had
not
the

for

otherwise

that
a

has
been
effected

sufferers
from
any
form
of
rupture
are
constantly
subject
to
the
danger
of
strangulation
this
occurs
when
from
any
cause
the
free
return
of
the
contents
of
the
protruded
part
of
the
intestine
is
prevented
it
is
an
accident

nature

per
cent
die
if
not
carefully
operated
upon
and
with
the
most
skillful
treatment
one
in
four
cases
terminates
in
death
every
individual
should
guard
against
rupture
by
maintaining
by
proper
exercise
diet
and
rest
a
condition
of
vigor
and
tonicity
of
the
muscular
system
when
debilitated
all
strains
and
exertions
should
be
care
fully
avoided
until
the
health
is
built
up
and
the
relaxation
overcome
treatment
the
palliative
treatment
of
hernia
is
by
and
reduction
consists
in
returning
the
protruding
intestine
to
its
proper
place
through
the
opening
by
which
it
escaped
this
is
accomplished
either
by
manipulation
or
by
a
surgical
operation
retention
is
effected
by
wearing
a
mechanical
appliance
called
a
as
soon
as
the
tumor
protrudes
or
the
bowel
comes
down
the
patient
should
assume
the
recumbent
posture
with
his
shoulders
and
feet
elevated
the
patient
or
an
attendant
should
grasp
the
hernia
and
with
gentle
but
gradually
increasing
pressure
upon
the
tumor
attempt
to
replace
it
at
the
same
time
let
the
patient
knead
the
bowels
upward
by
pressing
upon
the
integument
so
that
the
intestine
may
as
far
as
possible
be
pushed
away
from
the
point
of
protrusion
sometimes
the
contraction
of
the
muscular
fibres
at
a
point
where
the
hernia
makes
its
exit
is
so
great
that
the
tumor
can
not
be
replaced
in
this
case
the
system
should
be
relaxed
with
lobelia
not
given
in
doses
to
produce
vomiting
and
as
soon
as

under

influence
the

may
be
resumed
when
there
is
any
difficulty
experienced
in
putting

professional
assistance
should
be
promptly
summoned
after
the
reduction
of

a
truss
should
be
properly
adapted
applied
and
constantly
worn
to
prevent

with
the
exception

about

of

they
are
without
exception
harmful
unless
proper
support
be
given
to
the
walls
of
the

and
that
without
constant
pressure
a
truss
does
harm
then
too
the
shape
of
the
pad
must
be
such
as
to
avoid
pressure
where
it
is
not
required
otherwise
as
in
the
case

such
a
procedure
is

the

and
facilitating
its
replacement
it
is
a
delicate

skillfully
performed

vaunted
salve
ointment
or
styptic
lotion
applied
on

will
heal
and
cure

the

in
these
cases
is
the
curative
means
in
the
small
number
that
are
relieved
and
for
it
but
few
dollars
should
be
charged
instead
of
the
exorbitant
prices
demanded

these
impostors
improvements
in
surgery
in
this
age
of
wonders
have
kept
apace
with
the
advances
in
electricity
and
other
branches
of
science
diseases
and
deformities
which
only
a
few
years
ago
were
considered
incurable
are
now
overcome
and
cured
with
certainty
and
without
risk
or
suffering
especially
is
this
true
with
reference
to
hernia
or
rupture
our
specialists
have
devoted
much
attention
to
the
radical
cure
of
rupture
or
breach
with
the
most
gratifying
results
formerly
we
employed
and
advocated
the
use
of
the
injection
treatment
only
this
method
was
tested
and
brought
to
a
most
efficient
and
practical
stage
so
that
we
now
apply
it
in
the
treatment
of
over
eighty
percent
of
the
cases
that
are
presented
at
our
institution
this
plan
of
cure
as
used
by
us
is
a
great
advance
over
that
of
any
similar
one
in
use
throughout
the
country
our
fluid
is
much
more
safe
in
its
effects
never
gives
rise
to
the
troublesome
abscesses
and
inflammation
that
is
common
to
the
use
of
the
injection
fluids
that
have
been
advised
on
the
heatonian
method
the
fluid
we
use
is
a
bland
and
healing
agent
which
produces
an
exudation
behind
the
cords
that
surround
the
inguinal
rings
and
forms
a
well
defined
truss
pad
of
moderate
size
in
such
position
that
the
rupture
can
not
pass
by
it
and
appear
externally
it
causes
also
an
adhesive
inflammation
limited
to
the
hernial
sac
that
completely
closes
it
this
treatment
is
rendered
by
the
use
of
a
solution
which
is
injected
underneath
the
skin
with
a
fine
hollow
needle
attached
to
a
small
syringe
and
which
tends
to
produce
complete
local
anæsthesia
or
loss
of
feeling
so
that
the
procedure
is
thoroughly
and
carefully
carried
out
without
any
risk
or
discomfort
the
needle
used
by
us
for
the
treatment
of
the
hernia
is
so
perfected
that
any
possible
injection
of
the
fluid
into
the
abdominal
cavity
or
upon
the
coating
of
the
intestine
is
an
impossibility
and
in
no
way
can
an
injection
be
made
into
a
blood
vessel
or
nerve
so
as
to
produce
any
discomfort
or
trouble
we
thus
avoid
all
the
risks
that
pertain
to
the
usual
plan
of
injection
there
is
a
small
percentage
of
cases
as
before
stated
in
which
this
form
of
treatment
is
not
likely
to
give
a
permanent
cure
from
the
fact
that
the
omentum
or
intestine
has
become
adherent
externally
to
the
sac
or
in
the
scrotum
to
the
coverings
of
the
testicle
this
makes
the
complete
replacement
of
the
rupture
without
cutting
an
impossibility
and
in
such
cases
even
where
the
hernial
opening
is
closed
treatment
by
injection
only
would
not
result
in
a
permanent
cure
our
aim
is
to
treat
all
cases
of
rupture
that
we
undertake
in
such
a
manner
that
no
possibility
can
the
deformity
we
therefore
have
for
the
cure
of
these
cases
another
method
by
which
with
our
local
anæsthetic
fluid
we
are
able
to
perform
a
surgical
operation
without
any
distress
whatever
to
the
patient
the
greatest
risk
of
the
old
operation
for
rupture
was
the
danger
of
general
anæsthesia
with
chloroform
or
ether
or
some
similar
agent
the
great
majority
of
individuals
can
not
bear
the
inhalation
of
the
large
quantities
of
these
anæsthetics
necessary
to
secure
loss
of
feeling
without
consequent
nausea
and
at
times
an
effect
upon
the
heart
that
often
results
seriously
the
risk
from
the
anæsthetic
is
much
greater
than
from
the
surgical
procedure
by
our
method
this
risk
is
entirely
done
away
with
the
pain
dispelling
fluid
enables
our
operator
to
pursue
his
method
without
giving
the
patient
any
pain
or
discomfort
whatever
during
the
operation
he
is
in
full
possession
of
all
his
faculties
and
can
assist
in
any
way
desired
by
coughing
or
straining
in
order
at
any
time
to
complete
the
protrusion
of
the
rupture
and
show
its
entire
extent
of
surface
when
the
sac
is
laid
bare
we
then
replace
the
rupture
completely
suture
the
sac
so
that
the
rupture
will
have
no
pocket
into
which
to
descend
and
then
firmly
unite
the
rings
by
a
plan
that
we
have
invented
and
by
which
they
are
made
more
strong
and
firm
than
in
their
original
state
early
in
our
experience
and
while
using
the
plan
of
treatment
that
is
usually
employed
for
the
radical
cure
of
rupture
we
had
occasional
relapses
of

tried
wearing

made

hold

i
arrived
at

on

on
being
examined
by
one
of

i
was
pronounced
a
bad
case

by
your
mode

treatment
you
could
cure
it
i
was
therefore
operated
upon
by
one
of

without
any
cutting
however
and
comparatively
little
pain
by
your
scientific
method

in

returned

cured
the
time
i
had

was

wish
to
remark
that
his

reminded
me
very
much
of
bernard

professor
of

in
the
university

where
i
was
a
student
he
is
just
as
tender
and
sympathetic
with
his

as
that
famous
director
of
the
prussian
royal

hospital
has
been
as
to
the
medicines
of

i
recommended
them
to
members
of

congregation
who
told
me
that
they
did
them
good
bastian

dansville
a
druggist
told
me
that
your

are
bought
by
the
same
persons
again
and
again
i
consider
this
to
be
the
best
recommendation
a
medicine
which
is
of
no
effect
will
not
be
bought
a
second
time
by
the

my
case
as

severe
one
i
am
a
man
of
sixty
years
of
age
and
the
disease
had
been
the
source
of
serious
discomfort
to
me
since
childhood
the
protrusion
was
the
size
of
a
man
head
and
could
not
be
replaced
i
was
forced
to
give
up
all
exercise
and
suffered
much
at
my
daily
work
from
inconvenience
and
pain
any
injury
upon
the
protrusion
which
could
not
always
be
protected
was
followed
with
much
discomfort
and
my
general
health
was
seriously
affected
the
passage
of
the
food
through
the
confined
intestines
was
a
painful
process
often
times
and
kept
me
in
great
misery
i
am
thankful
to
state
that
since
your
operation
the
rupture
has
remained
sound
and
well
and
i
have
been
relieved
of

i

send

this
certificate
containing
a
synopsis
of
my
case
and
cure
of
the
same
my
life
was
a
living
death
for
years
i
had
almost
lost
all
hope
of
ever
being
cured
and
was
plunged
in
despair
as
i
had
tried
so
many
trusses
appliances
and
remedies
each
one
in
successive
repetition
a
failure
in
january
and
february
of
the
year
i
entered
your
institution
for
treatment
my
malady
being
an
inguinal
hernia
on
the
right
side
of
twenty
standing
from
childhood
i
was
then
impressed
with
the
feeling
that
it
was
my
last
chance
and
that
it
would
be
my
last
effort
and
to
be
candid
i
had
very
little
hope
that
a
cure
would
be
effected
to
me
my
condition
seemed
appalling
as
i
dare
not
eat
drink
laugh
exercise
or
perform
any
of
the
functions
of
life
without
having
to
reduce
my
rupture
frequently
as
often
as
forty
or
fifty
times
while
on
occasions
the
reduction
would
occupy
hours
of
untold
agony
no
truss
or
appliance
that
i
could
get
would
retain
the
rupture
and
i
had
tried
all
sorts
as
fast
as
they
came
to
my
knowledge
marvelous
as
it
may
appear
to
all
sufferers
from
this
distressing
affliction
i
was
discharged
from
your
institute
in
thirty
days
a
well
and
sound
man
and
only
from
memory
and
the
record
do
i
know
that
i
was
ever
ruptured
i
have
at
times
since
performed
some
of
the
hardest
kinds
of
work
for
long
periods
but
no
sign
of
weakness
has
ever
appeared
i
do
not
consider
the
necessary
operation
performed
as
attended
with
any
danger
it
is
no
comparison
to
the
chances
a
person
takes
who
in
the
daily
walks
of
life
is
tortured
with
a
rupture
while
an
inmate
of

accorded
the

in

from
a
specimen
in
dr
gross
cabinet
every
family
should
be
made
acquainted
with
the
symptoms
and
treatment
of
this
disease
especially
is
this
true
in
the
case
of
those
living
remote
from
a
physician
from
the
lack
of
this
knowledge
on
the
part
of
parents
many
a
little
one
has
perished
before
medical
assistance
could
be
obtained
in
some
of
its
forms
its
progress
is
very
rapid
and
unless
relief
is
obtained
in
a
few
moments
or
hours
at
the
most
death
ensues
there
are
several
quite
distinct
pathological
conditions
of
the
vocal
and
respiratory
organs
which
have
in
popular
parlance
been
designated
as
croup
but
two
of
these
are
worthy
of
consideration
here
these
are
or
croup
in
which
a
false
membrane
is
formed
and
both
may
result
fatally
but
the
former
is
much
the
more
dangerous
membranous
croup
is
supposed
to
originate
in
the
trachea
from
which
as
it
progresses
it
often
extends
upward
to
the
larynx
and
downward
to
the
bronchial
tubes
it
is
the
result
of
severe
inflammation
of
the
mucous
membrane
and
is
characterized
by
the
formation
of
a
false
membrane
which
covers
or
lines
the
inner
surface
of
the
true
structure
see
fig
it
is
formed
of
a
coagulable
exudation
from
the
mucous
membrane
on
being
brought
to
the
surface
and
into
contact
with
the
inspired
air
this
substance
grows
thick
and
tough
or
leathery
as
we
find
it
it
is
the
obstruction
in
the
respiratory
canal
which
this
foreign
matter
causes
that
gives
rise
to
the
labored
breathing
and
the
ringing
brassy
cough
together
with
the
crowing
or
whistling
inspiration
characteristic
of
croup
before
recovery
can
take
place
this
membrane
must
be
detached
and
expelled
the
cough
is
effort
to
accomplish
this
work
the
formation
of
this
adventitious
membrane
in
the
larynx
is
attended
with
more
danger
than
when
it
is
confined
to
the
trachea
in
most
cases
in
which
the
disease
has
had
a
very
speedily
fatal
termination
an
examination
has
shown
that
the
larynx
was
its
chief
seat
symptoms
true
croup
is
generally
preceded
by
what
is
known
as
a
cold
the
child
coughs
sneezes
and
is
hoarse
it
is
the
hoarseness
and
the
peculiar
of
the
cough
which
indicate
the
tendency
to
croup
this
has
been
already
described
in
addition
the
child
is
restless
fretful
and
feverish
the
disease
makes
rapid
strides
finally
the
cough
ceases
to
be
loud
and
barking
and
is
very
much
suppressed
the
voice
is
almost
gone
the
face

if

and
the
severity
of
the
case
if
there

quinine
is
a
valuable
remedy
and
is
tolerated
in

the
patient
body
should
be
frequently
sponged
with
warm
water
in
which
a
sufficient
quantity
of
saleratus
or
ordinary
has
been
dissolved

be
constipated
they
should

be
administrated
in
those
cases
in
which
there
is
a
tendency
to
croup
the
golden
medical
discovery
together
with
iron
and
the
bitter
tonics
should
be
given
to
build
up
the
system
and
counteract
such
tendency
the
treatment
which
we
have
advised
has
been
put
to
the
severest
tests
in
the
most
severe
forms
of
the
disease
and
has
resulted
most
successfully
if
however
in
any
case
it
does
not
give
prompt
relief
our
advice
is
to
lose
no
time
in
summoning
a
physician
who
is
known
to
be
skilled
in
the
treatment
of
diseases
of
children
spasmodic
croup
in
this
affection
no
false
membrane
is
formed
it
seems
to
have
a
nervous
origin
most
frequently
the
child
is
awakened
in
the
night
by
a
sense
of
suffocation
he
may
cry
out
that
he
is
choking
the
countenance
is
livid
the
breathing
is
hurried
and
each
respiration
is
attended
by
a
crowing
sound
the
child
has
fits
of
coughing
or
crying
and
makes
vehement
struggles
to
recover
his
breath
this
complaint
unlike
croup
is
unattended
by
fever
it
being
of
a
purely
spasmodic
character
with
no
inflammation
apply
hot
fomentations
to
the
throat
and
give
frequent
small
doses
of
tincture
or
fluid
extract
or
syrup
of
lobelia
to
produce
slight
nausea
or
better
still
an
acetic
syrup
of
made
by
adding
one
teaspoonful
of
the
crushed
or
powdered
root
to
one
gill
of
vinegar
and
four
teaspoonfuls
of
white
sugar
heat
this
mixture
to
the
boiling
point
strain
and
administer
from
to
one
teaspoonful
every
or
hour
slight
nausea
should
be
kept
up
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
produce
vomiting
this
is
usually
all
the
treatment
that
is
required

is

disease

occurs
it

the
characteristic
which
when
once

the

is
attended
by
a
copious
secretion
of
glairy
mucus
which
is
brought
up
at
the

part
of
the
paroxysm
during
or
at

of

paroxysm
vomiting
frequently
occurs
and

the
cough
is
so
severe
at
times
that
the

and
presents
all
the

bronchitis
sometimes
is
a
troublesome
complication

the

nosebleed
hemorrhage
from
the

is
commonly
the
result
either
of
a
catarrhal
or
an
inflammatory
condition
of
the
nasal
mucous

individuals
are
susceptible
to
it
who
are
oppressed
by

there
is

of
this
somewhat
troublesome
difficulty
causes
in
some
instances
an
examination
of
the
nose
will
reveal
the
presence
of
a
small
point
of
congested
vessels
usually
about
the
size
of
a
split
pea
upon
this
portion
of

small
scabs
form
and
at
any
time
when
they
may
be
dislodged
by
accident
or
otherwise
a
hemorrhage
will
ensue
the
constitutional
conditions
that
produce
the
tendency
to
hemorrhage
are
most
important
in
individuals
of
a
debilitated
condition
it
results
from
the
lack
of
a
proper
amount
of
fibrin
in
the
blood
where
the
blood
becomes
thin
or
loses
a
large
share
of

red
corpuscles
the

is
pale
and
hemorrhages
are
frequent
from

mucous
surfaces
of
any
portion
of

surface
being
especially
liable
to
such
attacks
treatment
this
is
local

constitutional
where
there
is
constitutional
imperfection
it
should
be
remedied
usually
in
young

there
is
some
difficulty
with
the
ovarian
or
uterine
circulation
and
the

nose
is
reflex
in
its
character
appearing
just
before
or
at
the
time
of
the

flow
accompanied
with
troublesome
headache
the
correction
of
this

is
by
the
use
of
the
favorite
prescription
and
golden

discovery
using
of
each
a
teaspoonful
three
times
a
day
taking
the
prescription
before
meals
and
the
discovery
after
meals
if
the
bowels
are
constipated
the
pellets
should
be
employed
in
order
to
overcome
any
congestion
of
the
liver
which
favors
the
manifestation
of
nosebleed
in
children
there
is
usually
a
debilitated
state
of
the
system
which
is
best
remedied
by
the
use
of
a
half
teaspoonful
dose
of
the
discovery
taken
three
times
a
day
after
meals
with
sweetened
water
this
treatment
should
be
continued
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
by
this
means
the
organs
rapidly
improve
in
their
activity
and

becomes
rich
in

and
fibrin
thus
strengthening

the
use
of
laxatives
is
of
great
importance
one
or
more
of
the

taken
on
retiring
at

are
most
beneficial
where
the
blood
is
not
up
to
the
standard
of
purity
even
though
the
individual
be
fleshy
the
discovery
should
be
used
a
teaspoonful
or
two
three
times
a
day
after
meals
in
conjunction
with
plenty
of
outdoor
exercise
and
the
best
of

where
the
hemorrhages
occur
in
those
having
too
much

the

must
be
corrected
by
the
use
of
vegetables
and
fruit
diminishing
the
amount
of

to
a
minimum
the

excellent
in
bringing

following
this
a
small
amount
of
subnitrate
of
bismuth
may
be
snuffed
into
each
nostril
usually
the
amount
required
to
cover
a
silver
piece
is
sufficient
the
powder
dries
the
surface
and
favors
the
speedy
formation
of
a
coagulum
or
clotted
covering
which
effectually
checks
any
further
hemorrhage
the
application
of
a
firm
compress
to

will
also
diminish
the
flow
of

through
the
arteries
that
run

often
follow
the
use
of

gastritis
is
generally
defined
as
an

of
the
stomach

tissues
are
all
liable

be
either
or
either

distinct
modification
of

manifesting
peculiar
symptoms
and
requiring
special
remedies
generally
occurs
as
a
result
or
complication
of
other
diseases
it
is
an
occasional
feature
in
scarlatina
serious
cases
of
bilious
fever
and
in
cutaneous
affections
of
every
description
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
stomach
is
placed
in
intimate
communication
with
all
the
vital
organs
by
means
of
the
nerves
of
the
hence
the
sympathy
between
the
stomach
and
skin
and
the
morbid
condition
of
the
stomach
occasioned
by
disease
of
other
organs
the
early
symptoms
of
acute
gastritis
are
a
burning
sensation
in
the
stomach
accompanied
by
nausea
and
frequent
vomiting
the
respiratory
movements
are
rapid
and
shallow
the
pulse
is
hard
and
short
and
as
the
disease
progresses
becomes
small
frequent
and
thready
the
tongue
usually
retains
its
natural
appearance
but
it
is
sometimes
dry
and
tinged
with
a
vivid
scarlet
at
the
tip
and
edges
intense
thirst
and
hiccough
are
occasional
symptoms
the
facial
expression
is
haggard
and
indicative
of
the
most
intense
suffering
the
stomach
will
not
retain
the
mildest
liquids
in
the
early
stages
of
the
disease
the
ejections
consist
of
chyme
and
mucus
streaked
with
blood
as
it
progresses
the
vomiting
becomes
a
sort
of
regurgitation
the
contents
of
the
stomach
being
ejected
without
any
apparent
nausea
or
effort
the
ejections
then
consist
of
a
granular
matter
resembling
what
is
known
in
yellow
fever
as
causes
formerly
it
was
supposed
that
this
was
a
very
common
disorder
and
the
term
was
applied
to
every
development
of
symptomatic
fever
but
late
clinical
and
pathological
investigations
clearly
indicate
that
acute
gastritis
is
of
rare
occurrence
it
may
be
caused
by
the
excessive
and
habitual
use
of
alcoholic
drinks
especially
if
taken
without
food
by
copious
draughts
of
cold
water
or
by
intense
emotions
but
its
cause
is
the
ingestion
of
irritating
and
corrosive
poisons
where
the
former
causes
are
known
not
to
exist
the
presence
of
poison
should
always
be
suspected
as
the
cause
sometimes
becomes
a
matter
of
legal
investigation
it
is
very
important
that
the
practitioner
should
be
able
to
determine
the
origin
if
caused
by
poison
the
disease
is
very
suddenly
developed
the
patient
complaining
of
a
very
intense
burning
sensation
in
the
throat
and
the
lining
membrane
of
the
mouth
which
will
generally
show
the
action
of
the
poison
a
diarrhea
is
also
more
apt
to
accompany
the
disease
if
inorganic
or
vegetable
poisons
are
known
or
suspected
irritants
the
appropriate
antidotes
should
be
promptly
administered

list
of
the
principal

treatment
the
inflammation
should
be
allayed
and
a
tea
made
of

is
very
serviceable
small
pieces
of
ice
swallowed
will
generally
allay
the
thirst
and
vomiting
and
a
mucilage

very
soothing
to
the

this
is
an
important
disease
and
its
management
should
be
entrusted
to
a
skillful
physician
chronic
inflammation
of
the
stomach
is
sometimes
mistaken
for
dyspepsia
or
gastralgia
it
is
very
necessary
to
discriminate
between
these
diseases
as
the
appropriate
remedies
of
the
latter
will
often
only
aggravate
and
augment
the
former
a
chronic
inflammation
of
the
stomach
is
a
very
common
affection
and
has
many
phases
but
the
term
chronic
gastritis
is
applied
only
to
that
species
of
inflammation
occasioned
and
accompanied
by
irritation
it
is
seldom
a
result
of
the
form
the
symptoms
of
chronic
gastritis
are
various
and
sometimes
vague
among
those
which
are
prominent
we
may
mention
an
irregular
appetite
at
times
it
is
voracious
and
the
patient
will
consume
every
available
article
of
diet
while
at
others
he
will
experience
nausea
and
disgust
at
the
sight
of
food
even
when
very
hungry
one
mouthful
of
food
will
sometimes
produce
satiety
and
cause
vomiting
the
appearance
of
the
tongue
is
variable
sometimes
natural
at
others
thickly
coated
the
desire
for
drink
is
capricious
varying
from
intense
thirst
to
indifference
another
prominent
symptom
is
a
sense
of
heaviness
and
heat
in
the
epigastric
region
after
partaking
of
food
often
a
small
quantity
as
a
teaspoonful
of
milk
will
produce
a
sensation
of
weight
as
a
heavy
ball
lying
at
the
pit
of
the
stomach
this
symptom
is
frequently
accompanied
by
a
frontal
headache
and
a
small
and
wiry
pulse
dull
or
shooting
pains
are
experienced
in
the
stomach
and
between
the
shoulders
and
the
patient
becomes
weary
melancholy
and
emaciated
causes
the
general
cause
of
chronic
gastritis
is
excess
in
eating
or
drinking
and
the
use
of
alcoholic
liquors
we
have
known
it
to
be
produced
by
drinking
cider
great
mental
excitement
predisposes
the
system
to
this
affection
occasionally
it
is
a
result
of
febrile
diseases
as
scarlatina
typhoid
fever
etc
in
some
families
there
is
a
constitutional
tendency
to
its
development
treatment
all
medicines
which
tend
to
irritate
the
stomach
should
be
studiously
avoided
the
bowels
should
be
kept
regular
and
the
skin
clean
by
frequent
bathing
stimulants
of
all
kinds
must
be
avoided
as
a
principle
article
of
diet
we
would
recommend
milk
and
farinaceous
articles
if
these
precautions
be
observed
nature
will
sometimes
effect
a
cure
lime
water
and
the
subnitrate
of
bismuth
in
doses
three
or
four
times
a
day
are
useful
to
allay
irritation
other
suggestions

neuralgia
of
the
stomach
gastralgia
gastralgia
is
a
neuralgic
affection
of
the
stomach
unaccompanied
by
inflammation
it
is
sometimes
mistaken
for
chronic
gastritis
although
there
is
a
marked
difference
in
the
symptoms
a
prominent
symptom
of
gastralgia
is
a
pain
radiating
from
the
epigastric
region
to
all
parts
of
the
thoracic
cavity
the
pain
is
sometimes
lessened
by
walking
lying
on
left
side
or
by
gentle
pressure
and
usually
abates
after
eating
but
is
renewed
in
a
few
hours
the
patient
occasionally
experiences
a
sense
of
heaviness
at
the
pit
of
the
stomach
nausea
and
frequent
salty
eructations
the
tongue
is
white
the
appetite
variable
and
there
is
no
desire
for
liquids
the
sleep
is
usually
refreshing
and
when
not
suffering
from
acute
pain
the
patient
is
apparently
well
the
symptom
of
this
disease
is
a
feeling
of
intense
despondency
and
sometimes
a
morbid
fear
of
death
an
effectual
method
of
distinguishing
between
gastralgia
and
chronic
gastritis
is
by
the
administration
of
an
alcoholic
stimulant
if
gastritis
be
the
affection
the
pain
will
be
augmented
whereas
if
it
be
gastralgia
it
will
be
relieved
cause
the
cause
of
gastralgia
is
a
local
or
sympathetic
irritation
of
the
nerves
distributed
to
the
stomach
treatment
the
pain
of
gastralgia
is
sometimes
allayed
by
using
half
a
teaspoonful
of
subcarbonate
of
bismuth
and
repeating
the
dose
if
the
attack
is
not
relieved
the
following
is
a
very
effectual
remedy
take
twenty
grains
of
quinine
combined
with
one
drachm
of
prussiate
of
iron
and
divide
it
into
ten
powders
and
administer
a
powder
every
three
hours
until
the
pain
is
completely
arrested
temporary
relief
may
be
given
by
administering
of
a
grain
of
morphine
or
ten
to
twenty
drops
of
chloroform
in
a
teaspoonful
of
glycerine
slightly
diluted
taken
in
one
dose
one
of
the
most
effective
remedies
for
preventing
a
return
of
the
attacks
is
that
invigorating
tonic
and
alterative
the
golden

the
patient
should
be
careful
in
diet
and
not
eat
too
much
food
which
should
not
only
be
of
a
nutritious
kind
but
easy
of
digestion
cleanliness
suitable
clothing
bodily
warmth
exercise
and
rest
must
not
be
neglected
sometimes
it
is

everything
tending
to
promote
the
tone
of
the

and
improve
the
functions

compelled
to
assume
a
recumbent
posture
and
is
inclined
to
lie
on
the
back
for
in
that
position
the
sufferer
experiences
the
least
pressure
of
the
vital
organs
against
the
peritoneum
there
is
also
an
inclination
to
draw
up
the
lower
limbs
and
retain
them
in
a
flexed
position
causes
prominent
among
these
are
injuries
which
have
been
inflicted
upon
the
intestines
compression
of
the
colon
or
rectum
perforation
of
the
stomach
or
bowels
either
by
violence
or
some
disease
thus
allowing
the
discharge
of

urine
bile
or
fecal
matter
into
the
abdominal
cavity
also
abortion
and
exposure
to
wet
or
cold
as
acute
peritonitis
is
always
a
grave
disease
involving
more
or
less
danger
to
life
it
is
the
wisest
course
to
employ
a
physician
and
trust
the
case
to
his
management
the
same
remark
is
equally
applicable
to
the
chronic
form
of
the
disease
chronic
peritonitis
like
the
acute
it
may
be
either
or
this
form
is
sometimes
though
rarely
a
sequel
of
the
acute
when
it
appears
independently
of
the
acute
it
is
generally
associated
with
some
cutaneous
affection
pertaining
to
the
abdominal
cavity
and
the
inflammation
is
induced
by
the
tumor
if
chronic
peritonitis
be
connected
with
the
diathesis
tubercles
may
be
discovered
upon
the
surface
of
the
stomach
and
alimentary
canal
and
may
also
be
found
in
the
lungs
and
brain
when
the
affection
is
not
tubercular
there
will
appear
in
the
abdominal
cavity
an
effusion
of
serous
fluid
of
greater
or
less
quantity
mingled
with
blood
and
pus
when
such
an
effusion
takes
place
the
abdomen
gradually
increases
in
size
or
becomes
smaller
than
is
natural
there
is
pain
attended
by
soreness
upon
pressure
and
the
patient
becomes
emaciated
inflammation
of
the
peritoneum
is
frequently
an
accompaniment
of
which
is
a
disease
peculiar
to
childbirth

which
may
arise
from
cold
or
be
communicated
from
one
parturient
patient
to
another
by
midwives
treatment
in
the
remedial
management
of
acute
peritonitis
it
is
obviously
necessary
to
use
some
agent
which
will
at
once
influence
and
change
the
congested
state
and
inflammatory
condition
one
of
the
best
agents
employed
to
make
a
decided
impression
upon
the
vascular
system
subdue
inflammation
and
modify
its
action
is
the
fluid
extract
of
veratrum
viride
administered
in
full
doses
and
repeated
until
the
system
shows
its
effects
in
a
decided
manner
warm
fomentations
applied
to
the
abdomen
are
sometimes
very
serviceable
and
are
objectionable
only
because
of
their
liability
to
dampen
the
when
the
abdomen
will
bear
a
thick
warm
poultice
apply
it
and
then
cover
the
entire
surface
with
oiled
silk
the
tincture
of
opium
in
doses
sufficient
to
relieve
pain
and
quiet
the
peristaltic
action
of
the

generally
necessary
epidemic
cholera
this
is
an
epidemic
disease
supposed
to
be
due
to
an
impalpable
specific
poison
but
as
to
the
exact
nature
of
this
poisonous
matter
nothing
definite
is
known
this
plague
first
made
its
appearance
on
our
continent
in
owing
to
its
great
fatality
it
is
a
disease
much
to
be
dreaded
symptoms
these
are
well
defined
it
is
characterized
in
its
earlier
stages
by
pain
in
the
stomach
and
bowels
especially
in
the
umbilical
region
nausea
vomiting
diarrhea
later
the
purging
is
excessive
and
the
matter
dejected
resembles
and
contains
white
solid
matter
the
patient
loses
strength
and
sinks
rapidly
the
secretory
organs
fail
to
perform
their
functions
normally
the
skin
is
sometimes
moist
but
oftener
cold
and
dry
but
little
if
any
bile
is
found
in
the
excretions
and
the
urine
voided
is
very
scanty
there
is
general
nervous
derangement
as
indicated
by
the
spasmodic
contraction
or
cramping
of
the
muscles
this
first
attacks
the
extremities
but
soon
affects
the
entire
body
and
gives
rise
to
excruciating
pains
the
head
is
affected
by
singing
roaring
disagreeable
noises
in
the
ears
the
pulse
is
feeble
but
quick
the
nails
are
of
a
bluish
color
the
tongue
is
coated
white
the
eyes
are
sunken
and
the
patient
has
a
appearance
the
temperature
of
the
body
rapidly
falls
the
surface
becomes
deathly
cold
and
unless
the
disease
is
promptly
arrested
in
its
course
speedy
dissolution
follows
the
disease
is
rarely
prolonged
beyond
hours
and
sometimes
terminates
within
three
or
four
hours
after
its
first
attack
treatment
the
kind
of
medicine
required
depends
upon
the
severity
of
the
attack
and
stage
of
the
disease
in
all
cholera
epidemics
there
are
premonitory
symptoms
such
as
an
uneasy
sensation
at
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
a
rumbling
of
the
bowels
this
is
apt
to
be
followed
by
a
painless
diarrhea
which
occasions
no
alarm
and
the
patient
pays
but
little
attention
to
it
herein
is
the
great
and
dangerous
mistake
the
patient
is
already
in
the
stage
of
which
must
be
promptly
arrested
or
he
will
suddenly
be
precipitated
into
the
stage
of
the
patient
should
lie
down
and
have
placed
about
him
bottles
filled
with
hot
water
thereby
exciting
warmth
upon
the
surface
of
the
body
at
the
same
time
administer
two
teaspoonfuls
of
the
extract
of
if
the
symptoms
are
urgent
repeat
the
dose
every
fifteen
minutes
brandy
thickened
with
sugar
may
also
be
given
in
either
the
stage
of
or
the
leading
indication
is
to
establish
by
promoting
perspiration

the
feet
in
water
as
hot
as
can
be
borne
give
the
extract
of
freely
and
thus
endeavor
to
excite
profuse
diaphoresis
no
time
should
be
lost
for
delays
are
dangerous
when
the
reaction
is
established
the
patient
should
remain
quiet
and
not
attempt
to
exert
himself
after
reaction
has
taken
place
the
sweating
should
be
maintained
for
twelve
hours
and
the
patient
should
drink
tea
and
and
partake
sparingly
of
soft
toasted
bread
and
chicken
broth
the
food
should
be
fluid
and
nutritious
but
taken
in
small
quantities
do
not
disturb
the
bowels
with
laxatives
until
the
third
day
after
the
patient
begins
to
improve
and
then
they
may
be
moved
by
an
injection
of
warm
water
great
care
should
be
taken
that
the
patient
does
not
indulge
too
soon
or
too
freely
in
the
use
of
food
when
a
skillful
physician
can
be
had
no
time
should
be
lost
in
securing
his
services
but
since
in
epidemics
of
this
nature
medical
men
are
generally
overworked

not
always
easily
and
promptly

be
had

have
been
quite
explicit
in
giving
full
directions
for

cholera
morbus
also
known
as
and
usually
occurs
during
the
summer
months
the
attack
may
be
sudden
although
it
is
usually
preceded
by
a
sensation
of
uneasiness
and
colicky
pains
in
the
stomach
symptoms
nausea
vomiting
and
purging
are
the
most
prominent
symptoms
the
discharge
from
the

is
at
first
of
a
thin
yellow
appearance
but
finally
it
becomes
almost
colorless
sometimes
after
the
contents
proper
of
the
bowels
have
been
evacuated
the
dejections
have
a
bilious
appearance
severe
cramps
and
pain
accompany
the
vomiting
the
vomiting
and
purging
usually
occur
in
paroxysms
but
finally
become
less
frequent
a
reaction
takes
place
the
extremities
grow
warm
and
the
patient
gradually
recovers

be
accompanied
by
intense
thirst

causes
cholera
morbus
is
most
prevalent
in
warm
climates
and
especially
in
malarial
districts
it
is
generally
the
result
of
eating
indigestible
articles
of
food
such
as
unripe
fruit
or
uncooked
vegetables

articles
which
furnish

treatment
if
the
attack
be
superinduced
by
eating
unripe
or
stale
fruit
it
may
be
proper
to
give
an
emetic
or
a
cathartic
but
ordinarily
first
give
a
full
dose
of
the
extract
of
and
if
the
vomited
matter
is
very
sour
give
the
patient
a
weak
alkaline
drink
which
may
be
made
by
dropping
a
few
live
coals
into
a
tumbler
of
water
this
will
not
only
assist
in
neutralizing
the
acidity
of
the
stomach
but
will
help
to
allay
the
thirst
and
accompanying
fever
if
the
patient
throw
up

first
dose
of
the
extract
of
a
second

be
given

not
allow
the
patient
to
drink
cold
water
and
give
only
tablespoonful
doses
of
the
alkaline
solution
every
thirty
minutes
if
the
thirst
is
great
occasionally
give
a
tablespoonful
of
a
tea
made
from
scorched
indian
meal
which
not
only
allays
the
desire
to
drink
but
also

irritation
of
the
stomach
if

be
obtained

a
tea

a

of

ones

leans
upon
some
support
whenever
possible
in
walking
he
moves
very
carefully

cautiously
with

thrown

the
body
is
frequently
supported
by
the
hands

placed
upon

nothing
serious

that
the

will
outgrow
it
the

not

the

are
very
often

therefore
urge
upon

the
great
importance
of
placing

under
the

of
surgeons

made

treatment
the
great
essentials
for
the
successful
treatment
of
disease
and
deformities
of
the
spine
are
first
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
structure
and
parts
involved
by
the
disease
secondly
the
adjustment
of
mechanical
appliances
perfectly
adapted
to
the
requirements
and
necessities
of
each
individual
case
and
the
proper
use
of
our
system
of
vitalization
applied
to
the
spinal
muscles
to
strengthen
the
weaker
and
relieve
the
undue
contraction
of
the
stronger
for
many
years
our
specialists
have
experimented
and
have
given
the
various
appliances
in
common
use
in
these
cases
most
thorough
and
practical
tests
and
have
found
them
very
defective
being
generally
constructed
upon
wrong
principles
the
physician
who
sends
to
a
mechanic
for
an
appliance
such
as
are
now
made
in
the
shops
of
most
instrument
makers
and
uses
the
same
is
doing
himself
an
injustice
and
barbarously
torturing
his
patient
by
forcing
him
to
wear
an
apparatus
which
is
heavy
clumsy
and
inevitably
injurious
instead
of
being
beneficial
in
its
results
in
the
treatment
of
diseases
and
deformities
of
the
spine
there
should
be
no
compromising
the
appliance
that
fails
to
give
complete
support
should
not
be
worn
in
our
treatment
of
these
maladies
we
employ
only
appliances
which
are
constructed
under
the
personal
supervision
of
our
specialists
upon
principles
dictated
by
common
sense
and
the
actual
necessities
of
the
case
we
do
not
confine
the
body
in
an
iron
jacket
our
apparatus
is
light
yet
durable
and
is
worn
by
the
most
delicate
children
without
pain
or
inconvenience
it
gives
proper
support
to
all
parts
and
is
so
nicely
adjusted
as
to
produce
pressure
only
upon
those
points
which
should
receive

leaving
the

by

we

no

this
is
the
very
class
of
diseases
with
which
the

as
a
general
practitioner
of
the
healing
art
fresh
from
the
founder
of
this
institution
early
realized
that
the
grand
unpardonable
sin
of
the
medical
profession
was
the
neglect
to
more
thoroughly
study
and
investigate
this
class
of
diseases
the
profession
is
diligently
cauterizing
and
poulticing
the
sores
which
now
and
then
appear
on
the
surface

the
internal
chronic
disease
of
which
these
are
merely
the
external
signs
is
too
often
overlooked
or
neglected
some
years
ago
we
devised
and
put
into
practical
operation
a
method
of
treating
patients
at
their
homes
without
requiring
them
to
undergo
personal
examinations
we
reasoned
that
the
physician
has
abundant
opportunity
to
accurately
determine
the
nature
of
most
chronic
diseases
without
ever
seeing
the
patient
in
substantiating
that
proposition
we
cited
the
perfect
with
which
scientists
are
enabled
to
deduce
the
most
minute
particulars
in
their
several
departments
which
appears
almost
miraculous
if
we
view
the
subject
in
the
light
of
the
early
ages
take
for
example
the
telegraph
the
greatest
invention
of
the
age

it
not
a
marvelous
degree
of
accuracy
which
enables
an
operator
to
locate
a
fracture
in
a
cable
nearly
three
thousand
miles
long
our
venerable
clerk
of
the
weather
has
become
so
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
most
wayward
elements
of
nature
that
he
can
accurately
predict
their
movements
he
can
sit
in
washington
and
foretell
what
the
weather
will
be
in
florida
or
new
york
as
well
as
if
hundreds
of
miles
did
not
intervene
between
him
and
the
places
named
and
so
in
all
departments
of
modern
science
what
is
required
is
the
knowledge
of
certain
from
these
scientists
deduce
accurate
conclusions
regardless
of
distance
a
few
fossils
sent
to
the
expert
geologist

him
to
accurately
determine

they
were
taken

can
describe
it
to
you
as
perfectly
as
if
a

it

also
the

accurately

so
also
in
medical
science
disease
has
certain
unmistakable
signs
or
symptoms
and
by
reason
of
this
fact
we
have
been
enabled
to
originate
and
perfect
a
system
of
determining
with
the
greatest
accuracy
the
nature
of
chronic
diseases
without
seeing
and
personally
examining
our
patients
in
recognizing
diseases
without
a
personal
examination
of
the
patient
we
claim
to
possess
no
miraculous
powers
we
obtain
our
knowledge
of
the
patient
disease
by
the
practical
application
of
principles
of
modern
science
to
the
practice
of
medicine
and
it
is
to
the
accuracy
with
which
this
system
has
endowed
us
that
we
owe
our
almost
reputation
for
the
skillful
treatment
of
all
lingering
or
chronic
affections
this
system
of
practice
with
the
marvelous
success
which
has
been
attained
through
it
demonstrates
the
fact
that
diseases
display
certain
phenomena
which
being
subjected
to
scientific
analysis
furnish
abundant
and
unmistakable
data
to
guide
the
judgment
of
the
skillful
practitioner
aright
in
determining
the
nature
of
diseased
conditions
so
successful
has
been
this
method
of
treating
patients
at
a
distance
that
there
is
scarcely
a
city
or
a
village
in
the
united
states
that
is
not
represented
by
one
or
more
cases

the
records
of
practice
at
the
invalids

institute
in
all
chronic
diseases
that
are
curable
by
medical
treatment
it
is
only
in
very
rare
cases
that
we
can
not
do
as
well
for
the
patient
while
he
or
she
remains
at
home
as
if
here
in
person
to
be
examined
but
we
annually
treat
hundreds
of
cases
requiring
surgical
operations
and
careful
and
in
these
cases
our
invalids

services

of

most
skillful
surgeons

also

is
quite
as
necessary

after
treatment
of
thoroughly
trained
and
skilled

what
should
be
the
essential
characteristics
of
an

obviously
the
most
important
of
these
characteristics
is
climatology
from
being
a
mere
speculative
theory
has
arisen
to
the
deserved
rank
of
a
science
the
influence
of
the
climate
of
a
country
on
the
national
character
has
long
been
observed
and
acknowledged
the
languid
but
passionate
temperaments
of
the
south
are
like
its
volcanoes
now
quiet
and
silent
anon
bursting
forth
with
terrible
activity
flooding
entire
cities
with
molten
fire
or
like
its
skies
now
sunny
cloudless
an
hour
hence
convulsed
with
lightnings
and
deluging
the
earth
with
passionate
rain

like
its
winds

their
wings

destroying

rushing
through
the
land

flower

blade

its

the
other
hand
the
calm
phlegmatic
temperament
of
the
north
accords
well
with
her
silent
mountains
her
serener
skies
and
her
less
vehement
but
chilling
winds
the
south
too
is
the
native
home
of
the
most
violent
acute
diseases
such
as
yellow
fever
and
cholera
but
aside
from
this
general
climatic
influence
there
is
the
yet
more
restricted
one
of
locality
it
has
often
been
observed
that
certain
classes
of
diseases
are
most
prevalent
in
certain
localities
the
prevalence
in
every
instance
being
due
to
peculiarities
of
climate
extreme
healthfulness
of
buffalo
in
the
published
records
of
the
examination
for
military
service
in
the
army
during
our
late
civil
war
this
fact
was
clearly
and
definitely
stated
and
maps
were
prepared
and
presented
showing
the
comparative
prevalence
of
certain
diseases
in
the
several
states
and
districts
represented
the
maps
are
prepared
by
a
graduation
of
color
the
lighter
shades
indicating
the
localities
where
the
special
disease
under
consideration
is
least
prevalent
and
it
is
a
very
significant
and
important
fact
that
in
all
chronic
diseases
not
due
to
occupation
or
accident
buffalo
and
its
immediate
vicinity
is
marked
by
the
lighter
shades
thus
in
epilepsy
paralysis
scrofula
rheumatism
and
consumption
our
city
is
little
more
than
tinted
with
the
several
colors
used
to
denote
these
diseases
illustration
a
patient
invalids
hotel
and
surgical

there
is
a
popular
but
unfounded
belief
that
buffalo
is
a
for
pulmonary
diseases
this
idea
could
have
originated
only
in
an
ignorant
disregard
of
facts
for
medical
statistics
prove
that
in
her
freedom
from
this
class
of
diseases
she
is
unrivaled
by
any
city
in
america
not
excepting

on

respect

the

is
to

in

the
death
rate
from

is
only
to
very
remarkable
difference
in
favor
of
our
city
only
last
summer
a
gentleman
residing
in
the
eastern
part
of
our
state
collected
and
compared
the
health
statistics
for
of
all
the
prominent
cities
in
the
united
states
the
result
showed
that
buffalo
outranks
all
in
healthfulness
a
great
deal
of
precious
breath
has
been
expended
in
blustering
about
buffalo
zephyrs
as
our
delightful
lake
breezes
are
sometimes
ironically
termed
it
seems
to
be
a
popular
belief
among
our
sister
cities
that
old
boreas
has
chosen
buffalo
for
his
headquarters
when
we
hear
a
person
dilating
upon
buffalo
terrific
winds
we
are
reminded
of
one
of
our
lady
acquaintances
who
recently
returned
from
a
european
tour
she
was
asked
how
she
enjoyed
her
sea
voyage
and
she
replied
oh
it
was
delightful
really
charming
there
is
something
so
grand
about
the
sea
we
were
not
a
little
surprised
at
this
enthusiastic
outburst
as
we
had
been
told
by
a
member
of
her
party
that
the
lady
had
industriously
vomited
her
way
to
hamburg
and
back
again
but
the
enthusiasm
was
easily
explained
it
is
fashionable
to
characterize
sea
voyages
as
delightful
charming
etc
now
we
suspect
this
popular
notion
about
our
trying
winds
is
traceable
to
the
same
source
it
has
become
customary
to
call
buffalo
a
windy
place
and
so
when
the
traveler
feels
a
slight
lake
breeze
he
imagines
it
to
be
a
terrific
gale
whatever
may
have
originated
this
notion
certain
it
is
that
it
is
utterly
undeniably
false
and
in
making
this
denial
we
are
not
alone
dependent
upon
observation
but
upon
the
facts
of
science
the
issue
of
july
of
the
buffalo
contained
a
series
of
tables
furnished
by
the
signal
service
bureau
showing
the
velocity
of
the
wind
at
eleven
prominent
cities
for
the
year
an
examination
of
the
table
shows
that
the
total
velocity
for
the
year
was
the
in
of
any
of
the
lake
ports
while
philadelphia
and
new
york
showed
far
higher
aggregates
of
velocity
than
our
city
on
this
subject
in
the
issue
of
august
of
the
same
year
the
editor
pleasantly
remarks
only
the
interior
and
southern
seaboard
cities
and
not
many
of
them
show
a
lower
total
velocity
of
wind
than
is
marked
against
this
city
and
as
for
those
places
heaven

their
unfortunate
inhabitants
in

sultry
nights
of
the

season
when
they
are
gasping
in

then
in
regard
to
of
the
great
desideratum
for
invalids
in
any
locality
here
again
sentiment
and
science
are
greatly
at
variance
an
examination
of
the
official
records
of
the
signal
service
bureau
and
the
statistics
of
the
smithsonian
institute
showed
that
out
of
a
list
of
forty
cities
on
the
continent
buffalo
ranked
highest
for
equability
of
climate
thus
we
quote
from
an
editorial
in
the
of
the

our
the
transition
from
summer
to
winter
and
is
exceedingly
gradual
and
consequently
buffalonians
are
seldom
afflicted
with
those
epidemic
diseases
which
generally
appear
in
other
localities
during
the
spring
and
summer
months
thus
the
thermometric
readings
of
the
signal

for
show
that
the
average
temperature
for
july
and

was
for

reduced

the

showed
an
average
of

and
for

a

equable

gradual
transition
from

of

as
will
be
seen
by
the
following

the

the

consideration

it

character

life

the
plea
of
escaping
the
confusion
and
excitement
so
detrimental
to
recovery
the
result
is
well
known
invalids
have
regarded
them
more
as
pleasure
resorts
than
health
resorts
spending
the
summer
months
there
but
fleeing
to
their
homes
at
the
fall
of
the
first
the
good
that
was
done
in
the
summer
is
undone
by
carelessness
and
exposure
in
the
winter
a
location
that
would
combine
both
city
advantages
and
rural
pleasures
seemed
to
us
upon
reflection
to
be
the
desirable
one
fortunately
buffalo

unsurpassed

our
many

retreats
our

certainly
a
more
desirable
selection
of
rural
scenes
and
pleasures
can
not
be
found
in
another
locality
in
america
a
genuine
home
in
erecting
the
invalids

our
paramount
design
was
to
make
it
a
genuine
home
a
a
home
where
the
child
of
fortune
would
miss
none
of
the
comforts
of
her
palatial
home
while
the
poor
man
would
find
not
only
health
but
his
pleasures
multiplied
a
thousand
fold
our

prices
are
far
less
than
those
of
the
retail
dealer
he
can
afford
it
his
sales
are
so
much
larger
it
is
on
precisely
the
same
principle
that
we
are
able
to
make
the
rates
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
comparatively
low
if
we
had
only
a
limited
number
of
patients
we
should
be
obliged
to
make
the
charges
commensurate
with
our
expenses
but
our
practice
having
become
very
extensive
and
the
income
being
correspondingly
large
we
are
enabled
to
make
the
rates
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
so
moderate
that
all
who
desire
can

in

we
can
make
only
brief
mention
of
a
few
of
the
more
prominent
division
of
labor
in
the
examination
and
treatment
of
patients
our
practice
is
divided
into
specialties
each
member
of
the
faculty
although
educated
to
practice
in
departments
of
medicine
and
surgery
is
here
assigned
to
a
special
department
only
to
which
he
devotes
his
entire
time
study
and
attention
advantages
of
specialties
the
system
proves
as
effectual
in
the
exercise
of
the
professions
as
in
manufactures
in
the
legal
profession
this
has
long
been
a
recognized
fact
one
lawyer
devotes
his
attention
specially
to
criminal
law
and
distinguishes
himself
in
that
department
another
develops
a
special
faculty
for
unraveling
knotty
questions
in
matters
of
real
estate
and
if
a
title
is
to
be
proved
or
a
deed
annulled
he
is
the
preferred
counselor
in
a
certain
manner
too
this
has
long
been
practiced
by
the
medical
profession
thus
some
physicians
and
we
may
add
physicians
who
call
themselves
regular
and
are
specially
caustic
in
their
denunciation
of
advertising
doctors
are
accustomed
to
distribute
cards
among
their
patrons
certifying
that
they
give
special
attention
to
diseases
of
women
and
children
in
this
institution
each
physician
and
surgeon
is
assigned
a
special
department
of
medicine
or
surgery
by
constant
study
and
attention
to
his
department
each
has
become
a
skillful
specialist
readily
detecting
every
phase
and
complication
of
the
diseases
referred
to
him
not
only
is
superior
skill
thus
attained
but
also
and
in
diagnosis
thoroughness
and
efficiency
in
any
branch
of
learning
can
be
secured
only
by
devoting
to
it
special
study
and
attention
when
the
faculty
of
a
university
is
to
be
chosen
how
are
its
members
selected
for
instance
how
is
the
chair
of
astronomy
filled
do
they
choose
the
man
who
is
celebrated
for
his
general
scholastic
attainments
or
do
they
not
rather
confer
it
upon
one
who
is
known
to
have
devoted
special
attention
and
study
to
the
science
of
astronomy
and
is
therefore
especially
qualified
to
explain
its
theories
and
principles
thus
all
the
several
chairs
are
filled
by
gentlemen
whose
general
scholarship
not
only
is
known
to
be
of
the
highest
standard
but
who
devote
special
attention
to
the
departments
assigned
them
thus
becoming
proficient
specialists
therein
the
same
system
of
specialties
is
observed
in
the
departments
of
a
medical
college
the
professor
who
would
assume
to
lecture
in
all
the
departments
with
equal
ease
and
proficiency
would
be
severely
ridiculed
by
his
colleagues
and
yet
it
is
just
as
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
general
practitioner
can
keep
himself
informed
of
the
many
new
methods
of
treatment
that
are
being
constantly
devised
and
adopted
in
the
several
departments
of
medicine
and
surgery
progress
in
medicine
in
no
other
science
is
more
rapid
and
real
progress
being
made
at
the
present
time
than
in
that
of
medicine
even
the
specialist
must
be
studious
and
earnest
in
his
work
to
keep
himself
well
and
accurately
informed
of
the
progress
made
in
his
department
thus
it
so
often
happens
that
the
general
practitioner
pursues
old
methods
of
treatment
which
science
has
long
since
replaced
with
others
acknowledged
to
be
superior
the
specialist
on
the
contrary
by
confining
his
studies
and
researches
to
one
class
of
diseases
only
is
enabled
to
inform
himself
thoroughly
and
accurately
on
all
the
improvements
made
in
the
methods
and
means
of
practice
in
his
special
department
the
difference
between
the
practice
of
specialists
and
that
of
general
practitioners
is
aptly
illustrated
by
the
difference
between
the
district
school
in
which
the
taught
all
the
branches
from
to
the
solution
of
unknown
quantities
and
the
charmed
mysteries
of
philosophy
and
the
modern
seminary
with
its
efficient
corps
of
teachers
each
devoting
his
or
her
whole
attention
to
the
study
and
teaching
of
one
special
department
of
learning
we
attribute
the
success
which
has
attended
the
practice
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
in
a
great
measure
to
a
wise
adoption
of
this
system
of
specialties
advantages
offered
to
invalids
obviously
the
most
important
of
these
advantages
is
of
of
the
thousands
whom
we
have
cured
of
chronic
diseases
we
have
probably
not
seen
one
in
five
hundred
having
accomplished
the
desired
result
through
remedies
sent
either
by
mail
or
express
and
advice
given
by
letter
yet
in
some
obstinate
forms
of
disease
we
can
here
bring
to
bear
remedial
means
not
to
be
found
or
applied
elsewhere
that
thousands
of
cases
of
chronic
disease
pronounced
incurable
have
by
our
rational
and
scientific
treatment
been
restored
to
perfect
health
is
conclusively
proved
by
the
records
of
practice
at
the
invalids
hotel

institute
here
in
obstinate
cases
are
brought
to
bear
all

most
scientific

be
obvious
medical

a

a
distinguished
professor
in
the
medical
department
of
one
of
our
universities
in
an
address
to
the
graduating
class
recently
said
some
professional
men
seem
to
be
ashamed
unless
they
have
the
character
of
universal
knowledge
he
who
falls
into
the
error
of
studying
everything
will
be
certain
to
know
nothing
well
every
man
must
have
a
good
foundation
he
must
in
the
first
place
be
a
good
general
practitioner
but
the
field
has
become
too
large
to
be
cultivated
in
its
entirety
by
any
individual
hence
the
advantage
of
cultivating
special
studies
in
large
towns
which
admit
of
the
subdivision
of
professional
pursuits
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
know
everything
something
must
be
wisely
left
unknown
indeed
a
physician
if
he
would
know
anything
well
must
be
content
to
be
profoundly
ignorant
of
many
things
he
must
select
something
for
special
study
and
pursue
it
with
devotion
and
diligence
this
course
will
lead
to
success

the
attempt
to
do
everything
eventuates
unavoidably

our

of

turn
the

off
with

the

is
equally
annoyed
if
consulted
by
those

to

more

himself

render

the

sees
no

the

relieve
certain
forms
of

he
believes
that
medical
men
should
possess
equal

that
any

of
medical
ethics
which
would
deprive
him

an
advertisement

physician
seeks
to
place
himself
conspicuously

to

who
thereby
incurs
an
individual
responsibility
before

his
no
good
reason
has
ever
been
assigned
why
any
well
educated
physician
trained
in
the
school
of
experience
until
he
becomes
proficient
in
medical
skill
may
not
publish
facts
and

especially
when
these
are
abundant
and
conclusive
the
following
extracts
from
an
able
article
by
the
rev
thomas
beecher
embodies
a
sound
view
of
the
subject
of
medical
advertising
he
says
i
am
glad
that
the
doctor
cured
him
i
am
glad
that
the
doctor
put
it
in
the
paper
that
he
could
cure
him
and
if
any
doctor
is
certain
that
he
can
cure
such
diseases
and
do
put
it
in
the
paper
i
am
sorry
what
a
pity
it
would
have
been
had
this
doctor
come
to
town
with
his
wealth
of
science
and
experience
and
gone
away
leaving
him
uncured
what
a
pity
it
would
have
been
if
he
had
been
so
prejudiced
against
advertising
as
to
read
the
responsible
certificate
of
the
doctor
and
give
him
the
as
a
quack
what
are
newspapers
for
if
not
to
circulate
information
what
more
valuable
information
can
a
newspaper
give
than
to
tell
a
sick
man
where
he
can
be
cured
if
a
man
has
devoted
his
life
and
labor
to
the
study
of
a
special
class
of
diseases
the
necessity
of
his
saying
so
becomes
all
the
more
pressing
his
to
advertise
becomes
imperative
when
i
was
in
england
i
found
on
all
the
dead
walls
of
london
placards
declaring
that
dean
stanley
chaplain
to
the
prince
of
wales
would
preach
at
such
a
place
that
his
grace
the
archbishop
i
think
of
canterbury
would
preach
at
another
time
and
place
again
that
an
oxford
professor
would
preach
in
short
religious
notices
were
sprinkled
in
among
the
theater
bills
and
the
highest
church
dignitaries
were
advertised
side
by
side
with
actors
singers
and
clowns
of
course
i
was
shocked
by
it
but
in
a
moment
i
bethought
me
if
it
be
all
right
and
dignified
to
hire
a
sexton
to
ring
a
bell
when
the
minister
is
going
to
preach
it
is
all
the
same
to
silence
the
bell
and
hire
a
to
tell
the
same
news
the
essential
thing
being
to
tell
the
truth
every
time
the
remedy
for
the
lying
advertisements
is
for
honest
men
to
tell
the
truth
iniquity
cometh
in
like
a
flood
then
the
spirit
of
the
lord
lifts
up
the
standard
a
really
able
man
whatever
be
his
gifts
makes
a
great
mistake
if
he
fail
to
use
those
gifts
through
want
of
advertising
if
a
physician
possesses
knowledge
that
enables
him
to
remedy
diseases
heretofore
regarded
as
incurable
what
virtue
or
modesty
is
there
to
hide
his
light
under
a
bushel
in
this
free
country
the
people
think
and
act
for
themselves
and
hence
all
have
a
deep
concern
in
the
subject
of
health
the
strong
popular
prejudice
against
the
doctors
who
advertise
is
due
to
the
fact
that
by
this
method
so
many
ignorant
charlatans
are
enabled
to
palm
off
their
worthless
services
upon
the
uneducated
and
credulous
but
the
practice
of
such
imposition
should
not
cause
a
presumption
against
the
public
announcement
of
real
skill
for
the
baser
metal
bears
conclusive
evidence
that
the
pure
also
exists
every
step
in
scientific
investigation
every
proposition
which
relates
to
the
interest
and
happiness
of
man
every
statement
and
appeal
involving
a
valuable
consideration
must
be
submitted
to
the
scrutiny
and
judgment
of
individual
reason
for
every
person
has
the
right
to
form
his
own
conclusions
and
justify
them
by
experience
those
claims
which
are
only
supported
by
empty
assertion
are
very
doubtful
misty
theories
vanish
before
the
sun
of
truth
he
who
renders
professional
services
can
not
be
successful
unless
he
be
sustained
by
real
merit
treating
patients
who
reside
at
a
distance
we
can
treat
many
chronic
diseases
as
successfully
without
as
with
a
personal
consultation
as
our
vast
experience
enables
us
to
correctly
determine
the
malady
from
which
the
patient
is
suffering
from
a
history
of
the
symptoms
and
answers
to
questions
furnished
we
have
not
seen
one
person
in
five
hundred
of
those
whom
we
have
cured
some
may
suppose
that
a
physician
can
not
obtain
through
correspondence
a
sufficiently
accurate
idea
of
the
condition
of
a
patient
to
enable
him
to
treat
the
case
successfully
but
a
large
experience
in
this
practice
has
proved
the
contrary
to
be
true
for
some
of
the
most
remarkable
cures
have
been
effected
through
the
medium
of
correspondence
in
most
cases
the
patient
has
thought
over
his
symptoms
hundreds
of
times
the
location
of
every
pain
whether
acute
or
mild
constant
or
occasional
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
occurs
have
been
carefully
noted
he
has
observed
whether
he
had
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
was
feverish
or
chilly
whether
troubled
with
cold
hands
and
feet
whether
full
of
blood
or
pale
and
bloodless
and
he
states
these
matters
with
accuracy
and
common
sense
when
writing
to
us
for
he
has
a
very
good
if
not
a
professional
knowledge
of
the
relative
importance
of
these
symptoms
so
in
regard
to
digestion
he
states
what
kinds
of
food
agree
with
him
or
whether
he
is
troubled
with
excessive
acidity
or
a
flatulent
condition
of
the
stomach
he
also
informs
us
whether
his
tongue
is
coated
and
bilious
or
clean
and
healthy
and
gives
many
other
particulars
too
various
to
enumerate
by
which
we
are
enabled
to
gain
a
perfect
understanding
of
the
case
if
his
description
be
not
sufficiently
complete
to
enable
us
to
obtain
a
definite
understanding
of
the
case
he
is
requested
to
answer
a
list
of
important
questions
which
are
sent
him
the
people
are
far
more
intelligent
in
these
matters
than
physicians
are
generally
willing
to
admit
a
patient
is
often
confused
while
being
personally
examined
by
a
physician
and
gives
imperfect
or
incorrect
answers
after
he
has
left
the
presence
of
the
physician
he
finds
that
he
has
failed
to
enumerate
many
of
the
most
important
symptoms
in
consulting
by
letter
the
patient
is
not
embarrassed
he
states
the
exact
symptoms
and
carefully
reads
over
the
letter
to
see
if
it
is
a
complete
and
accurate
description
of
his
sufferings
in
this
way
he
conveys
a
much
better
idea
of
the
case
than
if
present
in
person
and
subjected
to
the
most
thorough
questioning
and
the
timid
lady
and
nervous
young
man
write
just
as
they
feel
and
one
important
reason
why
we
have
had
such
superior
success
in
treating
intricate
and
delicate
diseases
is
because
we
have
obtained
such
true
and
natural
statements
of
the
cases
from
these
letters
many
of
which
are
perfect
of
disease
as
and
cashiers
who
daily
handle
large
quantities
of
currency
can
infallibly
detect
spurious
money
by
a
glance
at
the
engraving
or
a
touch
of
the
paper
so
the
experienced
physician
by
his
great
familiarity
with
disease
becomes
equally
skilled
in
detecting
the
nature
and
extent
of
a
chronic
malady
from
a
written
description
of
its
symptoms
urinary
signs
a
careful
microscopical
examination
and
chemical
analysis
of
the
urine
is
a
valuable
aid
in
determining
the
nature
of
many
chronic
diseases
particularly
those
of
the
nervous
system
blood
liver
kidneys
bladder
prostate
gland
and
generative
organs
this
important
fact
is
not
overlooked
at
the
invalids
hotel
and
surgical
institute
where
an
experienced
chemist
is
employed
to
make
such
examinations
and
report
the
result
to
the
attending
physicians
medical
authors
professors
and
practitioners
of
all
schools
admit
and
even
insist
upon
the
importance
of
such
examinations
in
diagnosticating
diseases
many
practitioners
neglect
to
take
advantage
of
this
invaluable
aid
while
others
fear
that
if
they
attach
much
importance
to
such
examinations
they
will
be
ranked
with
uroscopian
or
water
doctors
a
class
of
enthusiasts
who
claim
to
be
able
to
correctly
diagnosticate
every
disease

examination

the
advantages
afforded
by
these
examinations

be
carefully
packed

a

must
accompany

a
matter
of

that

generally
pay
so
little
attention
to
the

suspected

all
admit
that
an
examination
of

furnishes
unmistakable
evidence
of
the
nature
and
complications
of
the
disease
in
this
way
we
are
many
times
enabled

determine
whether
the

is
caused
by
congestion

who

we
are
frequently
asked
to
visit
patients
residing
hundreds
of
miles
away
that
we
may
personally
examine
their
cases
or
perform
difficult
surgical
operations
we
can
seldom
comply
with
such
requests
as
the
time
of
our
professional
staff
is
generally
very
fully
occupied
to
physicians
wishing
to
consult
us
in
intricate
cases
of
chronic
diseases
under
their
treatment
we
desire
to
say
that
we
shall
as
in
the
past
take
pleasure
in
responding
to
their
solicitations
we
have
all
the
necessary
instruments
and
appliances
required
in
executing
the
most
difficult
surgical
operations
and
as
we
have
had
much
experience
in
this
department
we
are
always
ready
and
able
to
assist
physicians
who
do
not
practice
operative
surgery
in
this
age
of
railways
and
telegraphs
medical
and
surgical
aid
can
be
summoned
from
a
distance
and
promptly
obtained
our
medicines
as
put
up
for
sale
through
druggists
are
not
recommended
as
or
panaceas
but
only
as
superior
remedies
for
certain
common
and
diseases
they
are
our
favorite
prescriptions
improved
and
perfected
by
long
study
and
a
vast
experience
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
diseases
and
have
gained
celebrity
and
sale
we
are
well
aware
that
there
are
many
chronic
diseases
that
can
only
be
successfully
treated
and
cured
by
careful
adaptation
of
remedies
to
each
individual
case
this
is
especially
true
of
the
and
delicate
diseases
of
the
kidneys
and
bladder
it
is
not
less
so
with
reference
to
nervous
debility
involuntary
vital
losses
with
which
so
many
young
and
men
are
afflicted
and
we
may
also
include
in
this
list
epilepsy
or
fits
paralysis
or
palsy
obstinate
gleety
discharges
and
many
other
chronic
and
delicate
ailments
of
which
our
staff
of
physicians
and
surgeons
cure
annually
many
thousands
of
cases
but
which
we
do
not
any
of
our
or
proprietary
medicines
no
relationship
with
humbugs
had
our
or
proprietary
medicines
as
sold
by
druggists
the
world
over
been
adapted
to
all
classes
and
forms
of
chronic
diseases
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
for
our
organizing
a
competent
staff
of
physicians
and
surgeons
to
act
as
experts
in
the
treatment
of
difficult
obscure
and
complicated
cases
of
chronic
diseases
that
we
keep
constantly
employed
in
our
buffalo
and
london
institutions
eighteen
medical
gentlemen
with
such
helpers
as
chemists
clerks
is
indisputable
proof
that
the
medicines
we
offer
for
sale
through
druggists
should
not
be
classed
with
the
humbug
nostrums
recommended
to
cure
everything
they
are
the
outgrowth
of
our
vast
and
extended
practice
in
the
treatment
of
chronic
diseases
are
and
they
are
not
unduly
puffed
and
lauded
but
simply
recommended
for
such
diseases
as
are
easily
recognized
and
which
they
are
to
not
confined
in
prescribing
our
physicians
in
the
treatment
of
cases
consulting
us
prescribe
just
such
medicines
as
are
adapted
to
each
particular
case
are
not
confined
in
the
to
our
list
of
a
few
or
proprietary
medicines
valuable
as
they
are
when
applicable
to
the
case
but
resort
to
the
whole
broad
range
of
the
employed
by
the
most
advanced
physicians
of
the
age
they
are
not
hampered
by
any
school
or
our
medicines
prepared
with
the
greatest
care
the
medicines
employed
are
all
prepared
in
our
own
laboratory
by
skilled
chemists
and
pharmacists
and
the
greatest
care
is
exercised
to
have
them
manufactured
from
the
freshest
and
purest
ingredients
our
faculty
probably
employ
a
greater
number
and
variety
of
native
roots
barks
and
herbs
in
their
practice
then
are
used
in
any
other
invalids
resort
in
the
land
using
vast
quantities
of
these
indigenous
medicines
we
can
afford
and
do
not
neglect
to
have
them
gathered
with
great
care
at
the
proper
seasons
of
the
year
so
that
their
medicinal
properties
may
be
most
reliable
too
little
attention
is
generally
paid
to
this
matter
and
many
failures
result
from
the
prescribing
of
worthless
medicines
by
physicians
who
have
to
depend
for
their
supplies
upon
manufacturers
who
are
careless
or
indifferent
in
obtaining
the
crude
plants
and
roots
from
which
to
manufacture
their
medicines
for
the
market
while
depending
largely
upon
solid
and
fluid
extracts
of
native
plants
roots
barks
and
herbs
in
prescribing
for
disease
yet
we
do
not
use
them
to
the
exclusion
of
other
valuable
curative
drugs
and
chemicals
we
aim
to
be
unprejudiced
and
independent
in
our
selection
of
remedies
adopting
at

and
that
indomitable
energy
that
neither
shrinks
at
obstacles
nor
yields
to
circumstances
in

pierce
is
an
ideal
type
of
american
manhood
of
medium
stature
robust
his
appearance
is
characterized
by
a
healthful
vigorous
vitality
while
the
full
lofty
brow
and
handsomely
cut
features
are
indicative
of
that
comprehensive
mental
power
and
remarkable
business
sagacity
which
have
combined
to
place
him
among
the
distinguished
men
of
the
age
as
an
earnest
worker
for
the
welfare
of
his
pierce
has
won
their
warmest
sympathy
and
esteem
while
seeking
to
be
their
servant
only
he
has
become
a
prince
among
them
yet
the
immense
fortune
lavished
upon
him
by
a
generous
people
he
hoards
not
but
invests
in
the
erection
and
establishment
of
institutions
directly
contributive
to
the
public
good
the
people
thus
realizing
in
their
liberal
patronage
a
new
meaning
of
the
beautiful
oriental
custom
of
casting
bread
upon
the
waters
noted
in
both
public
and
private
life
for
his
unswerving
integrity
and
all
those
sterling
virtues
that
ennoble
manhood
pierce
ranks
high
among
those
few
men
whose
names
the
empire
state
is
justly
proud
to
inscribe
upon
her
roll
of
honor
pierce
has
lately
erected
a
palatial
invalids
hotel
for
the
reception
of
his
patients
at
a
cost
of
over
half
a
million
dollars
a
man
of
the
time
speaking
of
pierce
the
says
he
came
here
an
unknown
man
almost
friendless
with
no
capital
except
his
own
manhood
which
however
included
plenty
of
brains
and
pluck
indomitable
perseverance
and
inborn
uprightness
capital
enough
for
any
man
in
this
progressive
country
if
only
he
has
good
health
and
habits
as
well
he
had
all
these
great
natural
advantages
and
one
thing
more
an
excellent
education
he
had
studied
medicine
and
been
regularly
licensed
to
practice
as
a
physician
but
he
was
still
a
student
fond
of
investigation
and
experiment
he
discovered
or
invented
important
remedial
agencies
or
compounds
not
choosing
to
wait
wearily
for
the
sick
and
suffering
to
find
out
without
any
body
to
tell
them
that
he
could
do
them
good
he
advertised
his
medicines
and
invited
the
whole
profession
of
every
school
to
examine
and
pronounce
judgment
on
his
formulas
he
advertised
liberally
profusely
but
with
extraordinary
shrewdness
and
with
a
method
which
is
in
itself
a
lesson
to
all
who
seek
business
by
that
perfectly
legitimate
means
his
success
has
been
something
marvelous
so
great
indeed
that
it
must
be
due
to
intrinsic
merit
in
the
articles
he
sells
more
even
than
to
his
unparalleled
skill
in
the
use
of
printer
ink
the
present
writer
once
asked
a
distinguished
dispensing
druggist
to
explain
the
secret
of
the
almost
universal
demand
for
pierce
medicines
he
said
they
were
in
fact
genuine
medicines
such
compounds
as
every
good
physician
would
prescribe
for
the
diseases
which
they
were
advertised
to
cure
of
course
they
cost
less
than
any
druggist
would
charge
for
the
same
article
supplied
on
a
physician
prescription
and
besides
there
was
the
doctor
fee
saved
moreover
buying
the
drugs
in
such
enormous
quantities
having
perfect
apparatus
for
purifying
and
compounding
the
mixture
he
could
not
only
get
better
articles
in
the
first
place
but
present
the
medicine
in
better
form
and
cheaper
than
the
same
mixture
could
possibly
be
obtained
from
any
other
source
from
biographical
sketches
of
new
york
at
the
age
of
eighteen
he
pierce
entered
a
medical
school
and
proved
a
devoted
student
graduating
at
with
the
highest
honors
a
simple
knowledge
of
the
routine
of
practice
as
then
in
vogue
was
not
enough
he
sought
new
means
of
healing
and
explored
schools
of
practice
that
were
prohibited
by
his
sect
he
denounced
errors
in
the
prevailing
schools
and
accepted
truths
belonging
to
those
prohibited
every
one
knows
how
such
daring
and
destructive
innovations
are
regarded
by
the
medical
profession
generally
pierce
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
detraction
pursuing
his
own
way
with
that
energy
which
proves
now
to
be
a
most
excellent
ally

medical
instincts

swindlers
these
men
have
watched
for
the
coming
of
invalids
on
the
cars
in

around
the
depots
in
the
offices
of
the
hotels
located
near

assume
a
style
of
dress
similar
to
that
worn
by

object
of
your
visit
to
the
city
be
known
to
no
one
whom
you
meet
on
the
cars

your
baggage
delivered
anywhere

in
the

we
have
observed
the
distinction
which
metaphysicians
have
recently
made
they
employ
the
term
psychical
to
indicate
the
relation
of
the
human
soul
to
sense
appetite
propensity
and
psychological
as
indicating
the
ultimates
of
spiritual

in
this
manner
we
use
the
word
psychical
as
describing
the
relationship
of
the
soul
to
animal
experiences
and
being
and
psychological
as
referring
to
the
