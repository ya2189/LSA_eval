preface
this
little
volume
is
respectfully
submitted
to
the
candid
consideration
of
all
who
take
an
interest
in
theological
inquiries
under
the
impression
that
it
will
throw
some
additional
light
on
a
subject
which
has
long
created
much
discussion
it
has
been
called
forth
by
the

revised

with

and

by
j
lightfoot
bishop
of
durham
in
this
voluminous
production
the
right
reverend
author
has
maintained
not
only
that
all
the
seven
letters
attributed
by
eusebius
to
ignatius
are
genuine
but
also
that
no
christian
writings
of
the
second
century
and
very
few
writings
of
antiquity
whether
christian
or
pagan
are
so
well
authenticated
these
positions
advocated
with
the
utmost
confidence
by
the
learned
prelate
are
sure
to
be
received
with
implicit
confidence
by
a
wide
circle
of
readers
and
i
have
felt
impelled
here
openly
to
protest
against
them
inasmuch
as
i
am
satisfied
that
they
can
not
be
accepted
without
overturning
all
the
legitimate
landmarks
of
historical
criticism
i
freely
acknowledge
the
eminent
services
which
lightfoot
has
rendered
to
the
christian
church
by
his
labours
as
a
commentator
on
scripture
and
it
is
therefore
all
the
more
important
that
the
serious
errors
of
a
writer
so
distinguished
should
not
be
permitted
to
pass
unchallenged
all
who
love
the
faith
once
delivered
to
the
saints
may
be
expected
to
regard
with
deference
the
letters
of
a
martyr
who
lived
on
the
borders
of
the
apostolic
age
but
these
ignatian
epistles
betray
indications
of
a
very
different
original
for
they
reveal
a
spirit
of
which
no
enlightened
christian
can
approve
and
promulgate
principles
which
would
sanction
the
boldest
assumptions
of
ecclesiastical
despotism
in
a
work
published
by
me
many
years
ago
i
have
pointed
out
the
marks
of
their
imposture
and
i
have
since
seen
no
cause
to
change
my
views
regarding
all
these
letters
as
forgeries
from
beginning
to
end
i
have
endeavoured
in
the
following

preliminary
observations
the
question
of
the
genuineness
of
the
epistles
attributed
to
ignatius
of
antioch
has
continued
to
awaken
interest
ever
since
the
period
of
the
reformation
that
great
religious
revolution
gave
an
immense
impetus
to
the
critical
spirit
and
when
brought
under
the
light
of
its
examination
not
a
few
documents
the
claims
of
which
had
long
passed
unchallenged
were
summarily
pronounced
spurious
eusebius
writing
in
the
fourth
century
names
only
seven
letters
as
attributed
to
ignatius
but
long
before
the
days
of
luther
more
than
double
that
number
were
in
circulation
many
of
these
were
speedily
condemned
by
the
critics
of
the
sixteenth
century
even
the
seven
recognised
by
eusebius
were
regarded
with
grave
suspicion
and
calvin
who
then
stood
at
the
head
of
protestant
theologians
did
not
hesitate
to
denounce
the
whole
of
them
as
forgeries
the
work
long
employed
as
a
in
cambridge
and
oxford
was
the
of
the
reformer
of
geneva
endnote
and
as
his
views
on
this
subject
are
there
proclaimed
very
emphatically
we
may
presume
that
the
entire
body
of
the
ignatian
literature
was
at
that
time
viewed
with
distrust
by
the
leaders
of
thought
in
the
english
universities
but
when
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
right
of
episcopacy
began
to
be
promulgated
the
seven
letters
rose
in
the
estimation
of
the
advocates
of
the
hierarchy
and
an
extreme
desire
was
manifested
to
establish
their
pretensions
so
great
was
the
importance
attached
to
their
evidence
that
in
in
the
very
midst
of
the
din
and
confusion
of
the
civil
war
between
charles
and
his
parliament
the
pious
and
erudite
archbishop
ussher
presented
the
literary
world
with
a
new
edition
of
these
memorials
two
years
later
the
renowned
isaac
vossius
produced
a
kindred
publication
some
time
afterwards
daillé
a
learned
french
protestant
minister
attacked
them
with
great
ability
and
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
many
readers
that
they
are
utterly
unworthy
of
credit
pearson

bishop
of
chester
now
entered
the
arena
and
in
a
work
of
much
talent
and
research
the
fruit
of
six
years
labour
attempted
to
restore
their
reputation
this
vindication
was
not
permitted
to
pass
without
an
answer
but
meanwhile
the
dark
prospects
of
the
reformed
faith
in
england
and
the
continent
directed
attention
to
matters
of
more
absorbing
interest
and
the
controversy
was
discontinued
from
time
to
time
however
these
epistles
were
kept
before
the
eyes
of
the
public
by
archbishop
wake
and
other
editors
and
more
recently
the
appearance
of
a
syriac
copy
of
three
of
them
printed
under
the
supervision
of
the
late
rev
cureton
reopened
the
discussion
cureton
maintained
that
his
three
epistles
are
the
only
genuine
remains
of
the
pastor
of
antioch
in
a
still
later
publication
bishop
lightfoot
controverts
the
views
of
cureton
and
makes
a
vigorous
effort
to
uphold
the
credit
of
the
seven
letters
quoted
by
eusebius
and
supported
by
pearson
lightfoot
has
already
acquired
a
high
and
deserved
reputation
as
a
scholar
and
a
commentator
and
the
present
work
furnishes
abundant
evidence
of
his
linguistic
attainments
and
his
perseverance
but
it
is
somewhat
doubtful
whether
it
will
add
to
his
fame
as
a
critic
and
a
theologian
in
these
three
portly
octavo
volumes
extending
to
upwards
of
pages
of
closely
printed
matter
he
tries
to
convince
his
readers
that
a
number
of
the
silliest
productions
to
be
found
among
the
records
of
antiquity
are
the
remains
of
an
apostolic
father
he
tells
us
in
his
preface
that
the
subject
has
been
before
him
for
nearly
thirty
years
and
that
during
this
period
it
has
engaged
his
attention
off
and
on
in
the
intervals
of
other
literary
pursuits
and
official
duties
many
we
apprehend
will
feel
that
the
result
is
not
equal
to
such
a
vast
expenditure
of
time
and
labour
and
will
concur
with
friends
who
as
he
informs
us
have
complained
to
him
that
he
has
thus
allowed
himself
to
be
diverted
from
the
more
congenial
task
of
commenting
on
paul
epistles
there
is
not
we
presume
an
evangelical
minister
in
christendom
who
would
not
protest
against
the
folly
exhibited
in
these
ignatian
letters
and
yet
it
appears
that
the
good
bishop
of
durham
has
spent
a
large
portion
of
his
life
in
an
attempt
to
accomplish
their
vindication
to
lightfoot
may
be
justly
awarded
the
praise
of
having
here
made
the
reading
public
acquainted
with
the
various
manuscripts
and
versions
of
these
ignatian
letters
as
well
as
with
the
arguments
which
may
be
urged
in
their
favour
and
he
has
thus
rendered
good
service
to
the
cause
of
historical
criticism
professor
harnack
in
a
late
number
of
the
states
no
more
than
the
truth
when
he
affirms
that
this
work
is
the
most
learned
and
careful
patristic
monograph
which
has
appeared
in
the
nineteenth
century
to
any
one
who
wishes
to
study
the
ignatian
controversy
it
supplies
a
large
amount
of
valuable
evidence
not
otherwise
easily
accessible
some
indeed
may
think
that
without
any
detriment
to
ecclesiastical
literature
some
of
the
matter
which
has
helped
to
swell
the
dimensions
of
these
volumes
might
have
been
omitted
everything
in
any
way
associated
with
the
name
of
ignatius
seems
to
have
a
wonderful
fascination
for
the
learned
prelate
not
content
with
publishing
and
commending
what
he
considers
the
genuine
productions
of
the
apostolic
father
he
here
edits
and
annotates
letters
which
have
long
since
been
discredited
by
scholars
of
all
classes
and
which
he
himself
confesses
to
be
apocryphal
the
of
martyrdom
of
which
he
also
acknowledges
to
be
a
mere
bundle
of
fables
he
treats
with
the
same
tender
regard
nor
is
this
all
he
gives
these
acts
or
large
portions
of
them
in
latin
and
greek
as
well
as
in
coptic
and
syriac
and
annotates
them
in
addition
he
supplies
likewise
english
translations
it
may
be
argued
that
the
publication
of
such
a
mass
of
legendary
rubbish
is
necessary
to
enable
the
student
to
form
a
correct
judgment
on
the
merits
of
the
subject
in
debate
but
surely
the
question
might
be
settled
without
the
aid
of
some
of
these
auxiliaries
lightfoot
has
long
been
known
as
one
of
the
most
candid
and
painstaking
of
scriptural
commentators
but
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
he
is
an
episcopalian
and
the
ruler
of
an
english
diocese
he
would
be
something
almost
more
than
human
were
he
to
hold
up
the
scales
of
testimony
with
strict
impartiality
when
weighing
the
claims
of
his
own
order
it
strikes
us
that
in
the
work
before
us
his
prejudices
and
predilections
reveal
their
influence
more
conspicuously
than
in
any
of
his
other
publications
he
can
see
support
for
his
views
in
words
and
phrases
where
an
ordinary
observer
can
discover
nothing
of
the
kind
and
he
can
close
his
eyes
against
evidence
which
others
may
deem
very
satisfactory
even
when
appraising
the
writers
who
have
taken
part
in
this
controversy
he
has
presented
a
very
estimate
he
speaks
of
those
who
reject
the
claims
of
these
epistles
as
forming
a
considerable
list
of
and
third
names
and
he
mentions
ussher
and
bentley
among
those
who
espouse
his
sentiments
according
to
our
author
there
can
not
be
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
the
seven
vossian
epistles
represent
the
genuine
ignatius
no
christian
writings
of
the
second
century
says
he
and
very
few
writings
of
antiquity
whether
christian
or
pagan
are
so
well
authenticated
he
surely
can
not
imagine
that
ussher
would
have
endorsed
such
statements
for
he
knows
well
that
the
primate
of
armagh
condemned
the
epistle
to
polycarp
as
a
forgery
he
has
still
less
reason
to
claim
bentley
as
on
his
side
on
authority
which
bishop
monk
the
biographer
of
bentley
deemed
well
worthy
of
acceptance
it
is
stated
that
in
on
occasion
of
a
divinity
act
the
master
of
trinity
college
cambridge
made
a
speech
the
epistles
of
s
ignatius
his
address
created
a
great
ferment
in
the
university
it
is
further
reported
that
bentley
refused
to
hear
the
respondent
who
attempted
to
reply
we
might
have
expected
such
a
deliverance
from
the
prince
of
british
critics
for
with
the
intuition
of
genius
he
saw
the
absurdity
of
recognising
these
productions
as
proceeding
from
a
christian
minister
who
had
been
carefully
instructed
by
the
apostles
bentley
refusal
to
hear
the
respondent
who
attempted
to
reply
to
him
was
exactly
in
keeping
with
his
dictatorial
temper
does
lightfoot
bring
forward
any
evidence
to
contradict
this
piece
of
collegiate
history
none
whatever
he
merely
treats
us
to
a
few
of
his
own
which
simply
prove
his
anxiety
to
depreciate
its
significance
and
yet
he
ventures
to
parade
the
name
of
bentley
among
those
of
the
scholars
who
contend
for
the
genuineness
of
these
letters
he
deals
after
the
same
fashion
with
the
celebrated
porson
in
a
letter
to
the
author
of
this
review
cureton
states
that
porson
rejected
these
letters
in
the
form
in
which
they
were
put
forth
by
ussher
and
vossius
and
declares
that
this
piece
of
information
was
conveyed
to
himself
by
no
less
competent
an
authority
than
bishop
kaye
lightfoot
meets
this
evidence
by
saying
that
the
even
of
a
porson
in
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
given
might
be
of
little
value
it
was
given
however
exactly
in
the
circumstances
in
which
the
speaker
was
best
prepared
to
deliver
a
sound
verdict
for
it
was
pronounced
after
the
great
critic
had
read
the
of
pearson
it
would
be
hopeless
to
attempt
to
settle
a
disputed
question
of
criticism
by
enumerating
authorities
on
different
sides
as
after
all
the
value
of
these
authorities
would
be
variously
discounted
we
must
seek
to
arrive
at
truth
not
by
quoting
names
but
by
weighing
arguments
not
a
few
however
whose
opinion
may
be
entitled
to
some
respect
will
not
be
prepared
to
agree
with
bishop
lightfoot
when
he
affirms
that
those
who
reject
these
ignatian
letters
are
with
few
exceptions
only
to
be
found
in
the
list
of
second
and
third
rate
names
in
literature
we
have
seen
that
bentley
and
porson
disagree
with
him
and
he
can
point
to
no
more
eminent
critics
in
the
whole
range
of
modern
scholarship
if
daillé
must
be
placed
in
the
second
rank
surely
pearson
may
well
be
relegated
to
the
same
position
for
there
is
most
respectable
proof
that
his
in
reply
to
the
treatise
of
the
french
divine
was
pronounced
by
porson
to
be
a
very
unsatisfactory
performance
the
most
elaborate
and
ingenious
portion
of
the
work
is
as
bishop
lightfoot
himself
confesses
the
least
satisfactory
lightfoot
we
believe
will
hardly
pretend
to
say
that
vossius
bull
and
waterland
stand
higher
in
the
literary
world
than
salmasius
john
milton
and
augustus
neander
and
he
will
greatly
astonish
those
who
are
acquainted
with
the
history
and
writings
of
one
of
the
fathers
of
the
reformation
if
he
will
contend
that
john
calvin
must
be
placed
only
in
the
second
or
third
class
of
protestant
theologians
in
the
presence
of
the
great
doctor
of
geneva
hammond
grotius
zahn
and
others
whom
lightfoot
has
named
as
his
supporters
may
well
hide
their
diminished
heads
in
the
work
before
us
the
bishop
of
durham
has
pretty
closely
followed
pearson
quoting
his
explanations
and
repeating
his
arguments
some
of
these
are
sufficiently
nebulous
professor
harnack
who
has
already
reviewed
his
pages
in
the
and
who
to
a
great
extent
adheres
to
the
views
which
they
propound
admits
notwithstanding
that
he
has
overstrained
his
case
and
has
adduced
as
witnesses
writers
of
the
second
and
third
centuries
of
whom
it
is
impossible
to
prove
that
they
knew
anything
of
the
letters
attributed
to
ignatius
as
a
specimen
of
the
depositions
which
lightfoot
has
pressed
into
his
service
we
may
refer
to
the
case
of
lucian
that
author
wrote
about
sixty
years
after
the
alleged
date
of
the
martyrdom
of
ignatius
and
his
lordship
imagines
that
in
one
of
his
works
he
can
trace
allusions
to
the
pastor
of
antioch
under
the
fictitious
name
of
peregrinus
writing
says
he
soon
after
lucian
caricatures
the
progress
of
ignatius
through
asia
minor
in
his
death
of
peregrinus
this
peregrinus
was
certainly
an
odd
character
early
in
life
he
had
murdered
his
own
father
and
for
this
he
was
obliged
to
make
his
escape
from
his
country
wandering
about
from
place
to
place
he
identified
himself
with
the
christians
gained
their
confidence
and
became
as
is
alleged
a
distinguished
member
of
their
community
his
zeal
in
their
cause
soon
exposed
him
to
persecution
and
he
was
thrown
into
prison
his
incarceration
added
greatly
to
his
fame
his
including
women
and
children
were
seen
from
morning
to
night
lingering
about
the
place
of
his
confinement
he
was
abundantly
supplied
with
food
and
the
large
sums
of
money
given
to
him
as
presents
provided
him
with
an
ample
revenue
after
his
release
he
forfeited
the
favour
of
his
christian
friends
and
became
a
cynic
philosopher
but
he
could
not
be
at
peace
he
at
length
resolved
to
immortalize
himself
by
voluntary
martyrdom
meanwhile
he
despatched
letters
to
many
famous
cities
containing
laws
and
ordinances
and
appointed
certain
of
his
companions
under
the
name
of
to
scatter
abroad
these
missives
finally
at
the
close
of
the
olympian
games
he
erected
a
funeral
pile
and
when
it
was
all
ablaze
he
threw
himself
into
it
and
perished
in
the
flames
there
is
very
strong
reason
for
believing
says
lightfoot
that
lucian
has
drawn
his
picture
at
least
in
part
from
the
known
circumstances
of
ignatius
history
the
bishop
returns
again
and
again
to
the
parallelism
between
ignatius
and
peregrinus
and
appears
to
think
it
furnishes
an
argument
of
singular
potency
in
favour
of
the
disputed
epistles
second
only
says
he
to
certain
other
vouchers
which
he
produces
stands
this
testimony
from
such
a
sample
the
judicious
reader
may
form
some
idea
of
the
conclusiveness
of
the
bishop
reasoning
peregrinus
begins
life
as
a
parricide
and
dies
like
a
madman
and
yet
we
are
asked
to
believe
that
lucian
has
thus
sketched
the
history
of
an
apostolic
father
when
lucian
wrote
ignatius
had
been
dead
about
sixty
years
but
the
pagan
satirist
sought
to
amuse
the
public
by
sketching
the
career
of
an
individual
whom
he
had
himself
heard
and
seen
and
who
must
have
been
well
known
to
many
of
his
readers
about
the
middle
of
the
second
century
the
church
was
sorely
troubled
by
false
teachers
especially
of
the
gnostic
type
and
it
may
have
been
that
some
adventurer
of
popular
gifts
and
professing
great
zeal
in
the
christian
cause
contrived
to
gather
around
him
a
number
of
deluded
followers
who
for
a
time
adhered
to
him
with
wonderful
enthusiasm
it
may
be
that
it
is
this
charlatan
to
whom
lucian
points
and
whose
history
he
perhaps
exaggerates
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
life
of
peregrinus
which
can
fairly
be
recognised
even
as
a
caricature
of
the
career
of
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
the
early
christian
martyrs
were
we
to
maintain
that
the
pagan
satirist
was
referring
to
the
apostle
john
we
might
be
able
to
show
almost
as
many
points
of
resemblance
the
beloved
disciple
travelled
about
through
various
countries
acquired
a
high
reputation
among
the
christians
was
imprisoned
in
the
isle
of
patmos
wrote
letters
to
the
seven
churches
of
asia
and
was
visited
in
his
place
of
exile
by
angels
or
messengers
who
probably
did
not
repair
to
him
john
died
only
a
few
years
before
ignatius
and
was
connected
with
the
same
quarter
of
the
globe
we
have
however
never
yet
heard
that
lucian
was
suspected
of
alluding
to
the
author
of
the
apocalypse
if
bishop
lightfoot
thinks
that
he
can
convince
sensible
men
of
the
genuineness
of
the
ignatian
epistles
by
bringing
forward
such
witnesses
as
lucian
and
his
hero
peregrinus
we
believe
he
is
very
much
mistaken
the
argument
is
not
original
for
it
is
pressed
with
great
confidence
by
his
predecessor
pearson
and
by
others
more
recently
but
its
weakness
is
transparent
professor
harnack
whilst
admitting
the
weight
of
much
of
the
evidence
adduced
in
these
volumes
scornfully
refuses
to
acknowledge
its
relevancy
above
all
says
he
lucian
should
be
struck
out
i
confess
i
can
not
imagine
how
writers
go
on
citing
lucian
as
a
witness
for
the
epistles
there
is
however
an
old
adage
any
port
in
a
storm
and
before
the
close
of
this
discussion
it
may
perhaps
be
found
that
lucian
is
as
good
a
harbour
of
refuge
as
can
be
furnished
for
the
credit
of
the
ignatian
epistles
in
the
whole
of
the
second
century
it
is
obvious
that
even
according
to
his
own
account
of
the
history
of
his
present
work
lightfoot
has
not
entered
on
its
preparation
under
circumstances
likely
to
result
in
a
safe
and
unprejudiced
verdict
never
once
says
he
in
the
preface
that
we
possessed
in
one
form
or
another
the
genuine
letters
of
ignatius
this
is
however
the
very
first
point
to
be
proved
and
the
bishop
has
been
labouring
throughout
to
make
good
a
foregone
conclusion
no
wonder
that
the
result
should
be
unsatisfactory
if
he
has
built
on
a
false
foundation
nothing
else
could
be
expected
there
is
not
we
are
satisfied
a
particle
of
solid
evidence
to
show
that
ignatius
of
antioch
left
behind
him
any
writings
whatever
this
may
be
deemed
a
very
bold
statement
but
it
is
deliberately
advanced
i
hope
in
a
subsequent
chapter
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
not
made
without
due
consideration
chapter
ii
the
testimony
of
polycarp
to
the
ignatian
epistles
examined
the
bishop
of
durham
affirms
in
a
passage
already
quoted
that
no
christian
writings
of
the
second
century
and
very
few
writings
of
antiquity
whether
christian
or
pagan
are
so
as
the
epistles
attributed
to
ignatius
this
assuredly
is
an
astounding
announcement
made
deliberately
by
a
distinguished
author
whose
attention
for
nearly
thirty
years
has
been
directed
to
the
subject
the
letter
of
polycarp
to
the
philippians
is
a
writing
of
the
second
century
and
it
is
by
far
the
most
important
witness
in
support
of
the
ignatian
letters
but
we
must
infer
from
the
words
just
quoted
that
it
is
not
so
well
authenticated
as
they
are
it
is
difficult
to
understand
by
what
process
of
logic
his
lordship
has
arrived
at
this
conclusion
in
an
ordinary
court
of
law
the
witness
who
deposes
to
character
is
expected
to
stand
on
at
least
as
high
a
moral
platform
in
public
estimation
as
the
individual
in
whose
favour
he
bears
testimony
but
if
the
letter
of
polycarp
is
not
so
well
authenticated
as
these
ignatian
letters
how
can
it
be
brought
forward
to
establish
their
reputation
nor
is
this
the
only
perplexing
circumstance
connected
with
this
discussion
there
was
a
time
when
according
to
his
own
statement
in
the
present
work
lightfoot
accepted
the
curetonian
letters
as
representing
the
genuine
ignatius
and
of
course
when
he
regarded
as
forgeries
the
four
others
which
he
now
acknowledges
in
the
volumes
before
us
as
if
to
make
compensation
for
the
unfavourable
opinion
which
he
once
cherished
he
advances
the
whole
seven
of
the
larger
edition
to
a
position
of
especial
honour
the
letter
of
polycarp
the
works
of
justin
martyr
the
treatise
of
irenaeus
and
other
writings
of
the
second
century
have
long
sustained
an
honest
character
but
now
they
must
all
take
rank
below
the
ignatian
epistles
according
to
the
bishop
of
durham
they
are
not
so
well
authenticated
in
his
eagerness
to
exalt
the
credit
of
these
ignatian
letters
lightfoot
in
his
present
publication
has
obviously
expressed
himself
most
incautiously
in
point
of
fact
the
letter
of
polycarp
as
a
genuine
production
of
the
second
century
occupies
an
incomparably
higher
position
than
the
ignatian
epistles
the
internal
evidence
in
its
favour
is
most
satisfactory
it
is
exactly
such
a
piece
of
correspondence
as
we
might
expect
from
a
pious
and
sensible
christian
minister
well
acquainted
with
the
scriptures
and
living
on
the
confines
of
the
apostolic
age
it
has
besides
all
the
external
confirmation
we
could
desire
irenaeus
who
was
personally
well
known
to
the
author
and
who
has
left
behind
him
the
treatise
already
mentioned
speaks
therein
of
this
letter
in
terms
of
high
approval
there
is
says
he
a
very
sufficient
epistle
of
polycarp
written
to
the
philippians
from
which
those
who
desire
it
and
who
care
for
their
own
salvation
can
learn
both
the
character
of
his
faith
and
the
message
of
the
truth
could
such
a
voucher
as
this
be
produced
for
the
epistles
ascribed
to
ignatius
and
were
the
external
evidence
equally
satisfactory
it
would
be
absurd
to
doubt
their
genuineness
but
whilst
the
internal
evidence
testifies
against
them
they
are
not
noticed
by
any
writer
for
considerably
more
than
a
century
after
they
are
said
to
have
appeared
the
date
commonly
assigned
for
the
martyrdom
of
ignatius
and
consequently
for
the
writing
of
the
letters
ascribed
to
him
is
the
ninth
year
of
trajan
corresponding
to
this
date
lightfoot
tells
us
is
the
one
fixed
element
in
the
common
tradition
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
and
in
the
antiochene
and
the
roman
acts
as
well
as
elsewhere
this
same
date
is
assigned
by
the
advocates
of
the
ignatian
epistles
for
the
writing
of
polycarp
letter
only
a
few
months
at
the
outside
says
lightfoot
probably
only
a
few
weeks
after
these
ignatian
epistles
purport
to
have
been
written
the
bishop
of
smyrna
himself
addresses
a
letter
to
the
philippians
in
due
course
it
will
be
shown
that
polycarp
was
at
this
time
only
about
years
of
age
and
any
intelligent
reader
who
pursues
his
epistle
can
judge
for
himself
whether
it
can
be
reasonably
accepted
as
the
production
of
so
very
youthful
an
author
it
appears
that
it
was
dictated
in
answer
to
a
communication
from
the
church
at
philippi
in
which
he
was
requested
to
interpose
his
influence
with
a
view
to
the
settlement
of
some
grave
scandals
which
disturbed
that
ancient
christian
community
is
it
likely
that
a
minister
of
so
little
experience
would
have
been
invited
to
undertake
such
a
service
the
communication
is
rather
such
an
outpouring
of
friendly
counsel
as
befitted
an
aged
patriarch
in
a
fatherly
style
he
here
addresses
himself
to
wives
and
widows
to
young
men
and
maidens
to
parents
and
children
to
deacons
and
presbyters
there
are
other
indications
in
this
letter
that
it
can
not
have
been
written
at
the
date
ascribed
to
it
by
the
advocates
of
the
ignatian
epistles
it
contains
an
admonition
to
pray
for
or
kings
and
we
are
not
at
liberty
to
assume
that
these
three
names
are
precisely
synonymous
by
kings
or
kings
we
may
apparently
understand
the
imperial
rulers
by
authorities
consuls
proconsuls
praetors
and
other
magistrates
and
by
princes
those
petty
sovereigns
and
others
of
royal
rank
to
be
found
here
and
there
throughout
the
roman
dominions
lightfoot
indeed
argues
that
the
translation
adopted
by
some
kings
is
inadmissible
as
according
to
his
ideas
we
have
very
good
ground
for
believing
that
the
definite
article
had
no
place
in
the
original
he
has
however
assigned
no
adequate
reason
why
the
article
may
not
be
prefixed
his
contention
that
the
expression
pray
for
kings
has
not
anything
more
than
a
general
reference
can
not
be
well
maintained
in
a
case
such
as
this
we
must
be
to
a
great
extent
guided
in
our
interpretation
by
the
context
and
if
so
we
may
fairly
admit
the
article
for
immediately
afterwards
polycarp
exhorts
the
philippians
to
pray
for
their
persecutors
and
their
enemies
an
admonition
which
obviously
has
something
more
than
a
general
reference
such
an
advice
would
be
inappropriate
when
persecution
was
asleep
and
when
no
enemy
was
giving
disturbance
but
at
the
date
when
ignatius
is
alleged
to
have
been
martyred
polycarp
could
not
have
exhorted
the
philippians
to
pray
for
the
kings
as
there
was
then
only
sovereign
ruling
over
the
empire
that
this
letter
of
polycarp
to
the
philippians
was
written
at
a
time
when
persecution
was
rife
is
apparent
from
its
tenor
throughout
if
we
except
the
case
of
ignatius
of
antioch
many
of
the
tales
relating
to
which
lightfoot
himself
rejects
as
fabulous
we
have
no
evidence
that
in
the
christians
were
treated
with
severity
the
roman
world
was
then
under
the
mild
government
of
trajan
and
the
troubles
which
afflicted
the
disciples
in
bithynia
under
pliny
had
not
yet
commenced
the
emperor
so
far
as
we
have
trustworthy
information
had
hitherto
in
no
way
interfered
with
the
infant
church
but
in
two
sovereigns
were
in
power
and
a
reign
of
terror
was
inaugurated
we
can
therefore
well
understand
why
polycarp
after
exhorting
his
correspondents
to
pray
for
the
kings
immediately
follows
up
this
advice
by
urging
them
to
pray
for
their
persecutors
and
their
enemies
if
by
kings
we
here
understand
emperors
as
distinguished
from
princes
or
inferior
potentates
it
must
be
obvious
that
polycarp
here
refers
to
the
two
reigning
sovereigns
it
so
happened
that
when
two
kings
began
to
reign
persecution
at
once
commenced
and
the
language
of
the
epistle
exactly
befits
such
a
crisis
the
whole
strain
of
this
letter
points
not
to
the
reign
of
trajan
but
to
that
of
marcus
aurelius
polycarp
exhorts
the
philippians
to
practise
all
endurance
in
the
service
of
christ
if
says
he
we
should
suffer
for
his
name
sake
let
us
glorify
him
he
speaks
of
men
encircled
in
saintly
bonds
and
praises
the
philippians
for
the
courage
which
they
had
manifested
in
sympathizing
with
these
confessors
he
reminds
them
how
with
their
own
eyes
they
had
seen
their
sufferings
all
these
statements
suggest
times
of
tribulation
a
careful
examination
of
this
letter
may
convince
us
that
it
contains
no
reference
to
the
epistles
attributed
to
ignatius
of
antioch
of
the
seven
letters
mentioned
by
eusebius
four
are
said
to
have
been
written
from
and
three
from
but
the
letters
of
which
polycarp
speaks
were
written
from
neither
of
these
places
but
from
in
the
letters
attributed
to
ignatius
of
antioch
the
martyr
describes
himself
as
a
solitary
sufferer
hurried
along
by
ten
rough
soldiers
from
city
to
city
on
his
way
to
rome
in
the
letter
of
polycarp
to
the
philippians
ignatius
is
only
one
among
a
crowd
of
victims
of
whose
ultimate
destination
the
writer
was
ignorant
a
considerable
time
after
the
party
had
left
philippi
polycarp
begs
the
brethren
there
to
tell
him
what
had
become
of
them
concerning
ignatius
himself
and
those
are
with
if
says
he
ye
have
any
sure
tidings
certify
us
in
the
ignatian
epistle
addressed
to
polycarp
he
is
directed
to
write
to
the
churches
to
call
together
a
godly
council
and
to
elect
a
messenger
to
be
sent
to
syria
polycarp
in
his
letter
to
the
philippians
takes
no
notice
of
these
instructions
he
had
obviously
never
heard
of
them
it
is
indeed
plain
that
the
letter
of
the
philippians
to
polycarp
had
only
a
partial
reference
to
the
case
of
ignatius
and
his
companions
it
was
largely
occupied
with
other
matters
and
to
these
polycarp
addresses
himself
in
his
reply
the
simple
solution
of
all
these
difficulties
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
the
ignatius
mentioned
by
polycarp
was
a
totally
different
person
from
the
pastor
of
antioch
he
lived
in
another
age
and
in
another
country
ignatius
or
egnatius
for
the
name
is
thus
variously
written
was
not
a
very
rare
designation
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
philippi
it
seems
to
have
been
common
the
famous
road
which
passed
through
the
place
probably
derived
its
title
originally
from
some
distinguished
member
of
the
family
we
learn
from
the
letter
of
polycarp
that
ignatius
was
a
man
of
philippi
addressing
his
brethren
there
he
says
i
exhort
you
all
therefore
to
be
obedient
unto
the
word
of
righteousness
and
to
practise
all
endurance
which
also
ye
saw
with
your
own
eyes
in
the
blessed
ignatius
and
zosimus
and
rufus
and
in
others
also
among
yourselves
sec
these
words
surely
mean
that
the
individuals
here
named
were
men
of
philippi
it
is
admitted
that
two
of
them
viz
zosimus
and
rufus
answered
to
this
description
and
in
the
latin
martyrologies
as
lightfoot
himself
acknowledges
they
are
said
to
have
been
natives
of
the
town
it
will
require
the
introduction
of
some
novel
canon
of
criticism
to
enable
us
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
ignatius
their
companion
is
not
to
be
classed
in
the
same
category
it
is
well
known
that
when
marcus
aurelius
became
emperor
he
inaugurated
a
new
system
of
persecution
instead
of
at
once
consigning
to
death
those
who
boldly
made
a
profession
of
christianity
as
had
heretofore
been
customary
in
times
of
trial
he
employed
various
expedients
to
extort
from
them
a
recantation
he
threw
them
into
confinement
bound
them
with
chains
kept
them
in
lingering
suspense
and
subjected
them
to
sufferings
of
different
kinds
in
the
hope
of
overcoming
their
constancy
it
would
seem
that
ignatius
zosimus
rufus
and
their
companions
were
dealt
with
after
this
fashion
they
were
made
prisoners
put
in
bonds
plied
with
torture
under
the
eyes
of
the
philippians
and
taken
away
from
the
city
they
knew
not
whither
it
may
be
that
they
were
removed
to
thessalonica
the
residence
of
the
roman
governor
that
they
might
be
immured
in
a
dungeon
to
await
there
the
imperial
pleasure
it
is
pretty
clear
that
they
did
not
expect
instant
execution
when
polycarp
wrote
he
speaks
of
them
as
still
living
and
he
is
anxious
to
know
what
may
yet
betide
them
let
us
now
call
attention
to
another
passage
in
this
letter
of
polycarp
to
the
philippians
towards
its
close
the
following
sentence
appears
somewhat
in
the
form
of
a
postscript
ye
wrote
to
me
both
ye
yourselves
and
ignatius
asking
that
if
any
one
should
go
to
syria
he
carry
thither
the
letters
we
have
here
the
reading
and
translation
adopted
by
lightfoot
but
it
so
happens
that
there
is
another
reading
perhaps
on
the
whole
quite
as
well
supported
by
the
authority
of
versions
and
manuscripts
it
may
be
thus
rendered
ye
wrote
to
me
both
ye
yourselves
and
ignatius
suggesting
that
if
any
one
is
going
to
syria
he
might
carry
thither
letters
to
the
sentence
as
interpreted
by
the
advocates
of
the
ignatian
epistles
wears
a
strange
and
suspicious
aspect
if
ignatius
and
the
philippians
wished
their
letters
to
be
carried
to
why
did
they
not
say
so
syria
was
an
extensive
province
much
larger
than
all
ireland
and
many
a
traveller
might
have
been
going
there
who
would
have
found
it
quite
impracticable
to
deliver
letters
in
its
metropolis
when
there
was
no
penny
postage
and
when
letters
of
friendship
were
often
carried
by
private
hands
if
an
individual
residing
in
the
north
or
south
of
the
emerald
isle
had
requested
a
correspondent
in
bristol
to
send
his
letters
by
any
one
going
over
to
ireland
it
would
not
have
been
extraordinary
if
the
englishman
had
received
the
message
with
amazement
could
any
one
passing
over
to
ireland
be
expected
to
deliver
letters
in
cork
or
londonderry
there
were
many
places
of
note
in
syria
far
distant
from
antioch
and
it
was
preposterous
to
propose
that
any
one
travelling
to
that
province
should
carry
letters
to
its
capital
city
no
one
can
pretend
to
say
that
the
whole
or
even
any
considerable
part
of
syria
was
under
the
ecclesiastical
supervision
of
ignatius
for
long
after
this
period
the
jurisdiction
of
a
bishop
did
not
extend
beyond
the
walls
of
the
town
in
which
he
dwelt
if
ignatius
meant
to
have
his
letters
taken
to
why
vaguely
say
that
they
were
to
be
carried
to
syria
why
not
distinctly
name
the
place
of
their
destination
it
had
long
been
the
scene
of
his
pastoral
labours
and
it
might
have
been
expected
that
its
very
designation
would
have
been
repeated
by
him
with
peculiar
interest
no
good
reason
can
be
given
why
he
should
speak
of
syria
and
not
of
antioch
as
the
place
to
which
his
letters
were
to
be
transmitted
nor
is
this
the
only
perplexing
circumstance
associated
with
the
request
mentioned
in
the
postscript
to
this
letter
if
the
philippians
or
ignatius
had
sent
letters
to
polycarp
addressed
to
the
church
of
antioch
was
it
necessary
for
them
to
say
to
him
that
they
should
be
forwarded
would
not
his
own
common
sense
have
directed
him
what
to
do
he
was
not
surely
such
a
dotard
that
he
required
to
be
told
how
to
dispose
of
these
epistles
if
we
are
to
be
guided
by
the
statements
in
the
ignatian
epistles
we
must
infer
that
the
letters
to
be
sent
to
antioch
were
to
be
forwarded
with
the
utmost
expedition
a
council
was
to
be
called
forthwith
and
by
it
a
messenger
fit
to
bear
the
name
of
god
courier
was
to
be
chosen
to
carry
them
to
the
syrian
metropolis
there
are
no
such
signs
of
haste
or
urgency
indicated
in
the
postscript
to
polycarp
epistle
the
letters
of
which
he
speaks
could
afford
to
wait
until
some
one
happened
to
be
travelling
to
syria
and
then
it
is
suggested
he
take
them
along
with
him
if
we
adopt
the
reading
to
be
found
in
the
latin
version
and
which
from
internal
evidence
we
may
judge
to
be
a
true
rendering
of
the
original
we
are
according
to
the
interpretation
which
must
be
given
to
it
by
the
advocates
of
the
ignatian
epistles
involved
in
hopeless
bewilderment
if
by
syria
we
understand
the
eastern
province
what
possibly
can
be
the
meaning
of
the
words
addressed
by
polycarp
to
the
philippians
if
any
one
is
going
to
syria
he
might
thither
my
letters
to
any
one
passing
from
smyrna
to
philippi
turns
his
face
to
the
but
a
traveller
from
smyrna
to
syria
proceeds
or
in
the
exactly
opposite
direction
how
could
polycarp
hope
to
keep
up
a
correspondence
with
his
brethren
of
philippi
if
he
sent
his
letters
to
the
distant
east
by
any
one
who
might
be
going
there
it
is
pretty
evident
that
the
latin
version
has
preserved
the
true
original
of
this
postscript
and
that
the
current
reading
adopted
by
lightfoot
and
others
must
be
traced
to
the
misapprehensions
of
transcribers
puzzled
by
the
statement
that
letters
from
polycarp
to
the
philippians
were
to
be
sent
to
syria
they
have
tried
to
correct
the
text
by
changing
greek
par
haemon
into
greek
par
humon
implying
that
the
letters
were
to
be
transmitted
not
from
polycarp
to
the
philippians
but
from
the
philippians
to
antioch
a
very
simple
explanation
may
however
remove
this
whole
difficulty
if
by
syria
we
understand
not
the
great
eastern
province
so
called
but
a
little
island
of
similar
name
in
the
aegaean
sea
the
real
bearing
of
the
request
is
at
once
apparent
psyria
in
the
course
of
time
contracted
into
psyra
lies
a
few
miles
west
of
chios
and
is
almost
directly
on
the
way
between
smyrna
and
neapolis
the
of
philippi
a
letter
from
smyrna
left
there
would
be
carried
a
considerable
distance
on
its
journey
to
philippi
some
friendly
hand
might
convey
it
from
thence
to
its
destination
psyria
and
syria
are
words
so
akin
in
sound
that
a
transcriber
of
polycarp
letter
copying
from
dictation
might
readily
mistake
the
one
for
the
other
and
thus
an
error
creeping
into
an
early
manuscript
may
have
led
to
all
this
perplexity
letters
in
those
days
could
commonly
be
sent
only
by
special
messengers
or
friends
traveling
abroad
and
the
philippians
had
made
a
suggestion
to
polycarp
as
to
the
best
mode
of
keeping
up
their
correspondence
they
had
probably
some
in
psyria
and
a
letter
sent
there
to
one
or
other
of
them
could
at
the
earliest
opportunity
be
forwarded
but
another
explanation
perhaps
quite
as
worthy
of
acceptance
may
solve
this
mystery
syria
was
the
ancient
name
of
another
island
in
the
aegaean
sea
and
one
of
the
cyclades
though
it
is
not
so
much
as
psyria
in
the
direct
course
between
smyrna
and
philippi
it
is
a
place
of
greater
celebrity
and
of
more
commercial
importance
like
psyria
in
the
course
of
ages
its
name
has
been
contracted
and
it
is
now
known
as
syra
between
it
and
smyrna
there
has
been
much
intercourse
from
time
immemorial
it
has
been
famous
since
the
days
of
homer
and
it
was
anciently
the
seat
of
a
bishop
an
evidence
that
it
must
soon
have
had
a
christian
population
it
is
at
the
present
day
the
centre
of
an
active
trade
and
a
late
distinguished
traveller
has
told
us
how
not
many
years
ago
in
an
afternoon
he
and
his
party
left
syra
and
next
morning
anchored
in
front
of
the
town
of
smyrna
syria
is
not
as
has
been
intimated
in
the
direct
route
to
philippi
but
the
shortest
way
is
not
always
either
the
best
or
the
most
convenient
at
present
this
place
is
the
principal
port
of
the
greek
archipelago
and
probably
in
the
days
of
polycarp
vessels
were
continually
leaving
its
harbour
for
towns
on
the
opposite
coasts
of
the
aegaean
a
christian
merchant
resident
in
syria
would
thus
have
facilities
for
sending
letters
left
with
him
either
to
smyrna
or
philippi
ignatius
or
his
friends
may
have
heard
of
an
offer
from
such
a
quarter
to
take
charge
of
their
correspondence
and
may
have
accordingly
made
the
suggestion
noticed
at
the
close
of
polycarp
letter
as
the
island
of
syria
was
well
known
to
them
all
the
smyrnaeans
could
not
have
misunderstood
the
intimation
this
explanation
throws
light
on
another
part
of
this
postscript
which
has
long
been
embarrassing
to
many
readers
after
adverting
to
the
request
of
ignatius
and
the
philippians
relative
to
the
conveyance
of
the
letters
polycarp
adds
which
request
i
will
attend
to
if
i
get
a
fit
opportunity
either
personally
or
by
one
whom
i
shall
depute
to
act
likewise
on
your
behalf
according
to
the
current
interpretation
polycarp
here
suggests
the
probability
of
a
personal
visit
to
the
eastern
capital
if
he
could
find
no
one
else
to
undertake
the
service
the
occasion
evidently
called
for
no
such
piece
of
on
the
part
of
this
apostolic
father
the
church
of
antioch
after
the
removal
of
its
pastor
ignatius
was
we
are
assured
delivered
from
farther
trouble
and
was
now
at
peace
the
presence
of
the
minister
of
smyrna
there
was
utterly
unnecessary
the
place
was
very
far
distant
and
why
then
should
he
be
called
on
to
undertake
a
wearisome
and
expensive
journey
to
antioch
and
back
again
polycarp
admits
that
his
visit
was
not
essential
and
that
a
messenger
might
do
all
that
was
required
quite
as
well
but
if
by
syria
we
understand
one
of
the
sporades
or
cyclades
we
are
furnished
with
a
ready
solution
of
this
enigma
the
little
island
of
psyria
was
distant
from
smyrna
only
a
few
hours
sail
and
as
it
was
perhaps
the
residence
of
some
of
his
polycarp
might
soon
require
to
repair
to
it
in
the
discharge
of
his
ecclesiastical
duties
he
could
then
take
along
with
him
so
far
the
letters
intended
for
philippi
or
if
by
syria
we
here
understand
the
little
island
anciently
so
called
near
the
centre
of
the
cyclades
the
explanation
is
equally
satisfactory
the
letter
of
polycarp
was
written
not
as
lightfoot
contends
in
but
as
we
have
seen
about
when
as
the
whole
strain
of
the
epistle
indicates
he
was
far
advanced
in
life
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
about
this
very
juncture
he
was
contemplating
a
journey
to
rome
that
he
might
have
a
personal
conference
with
its
chief
pastor
anicetus
his
appearance
in
the
seat
of
empire
on
that
occasion
created
a
great
sensation
and
seems
to
have
produced
very
important
results
if
he
now
went
there
any
one
who
looks
at
the
map
may
see
that
he
must
pass
syria
on
the
way
he
could
thus
take
the
opportunity
of
leaving
there
any
letters
for
philippi
of
which
he
might
be
the
bearer
at
a
subsequent
stage
of
our
discussion
this
visit
of
polycarp
to
rome
must
again
occupy
our
attention
the
facts
brought
under
the
notice
of
the
reader
in
this
chapter
may
help
him
to
understand
how
it
has
happened
that
so
many
have
been
befooled
by
the
claims
of
these
ignatian
epistles
a
mistake
as
to
two
of
the
names
mentioned
in
the
letter
of
polycarp
created
as
will
subsequently
appear
by
the
crafty
contrivance
of
a
manufacturer
of
spurious
documents
has
led
to
a
vast
amount
of
blundering
and
misapprehension
ignatius
a
man
of
philippi
has
been
supposed
to
be
ignatius
the
pastor
of
antioch
and
syria
the
eastern
province
of
the
roman
empire
has
been
confounded
with
psyria
or
syria
either
of
these
names
representing
an
island
in
the

we

of
letters
which
were
deemed
worthy
of

which

since

some
time
afterwards
an
adroit

with
a
view
to

concocted
a
series
of
letters
which
he
fathered
upon
ignatius
of

in
an
uncritical
age
the
cheat
succeeded
the
letters
were
quite
to
the
taste
of
many
readers
and
ever
since
they
have
been
the
delight
of
high
churchmen
popes

that

in

form
the

of

been
the

his

chapter
iii
the
date
of
the
martyrdom
of
polycarp
to
many
it
may
appear
that
there
can
be
no
connection
between
the
date
of
the
martyrdom
of
polycarp
and
the
claims
of
the
ignatian
epistles
all
conversant
with
the
history
of
this
controversy
must
however
be
aware
that
the
question
of
chronology
has
entered
largely
into
the
discussion
if
we
defer
to
the
authority
of
the
earliest
and
best
witnesses
to
whom
we
can
appeal
for
guidance
it
is
impossible
to
remove
the
cloud
of
suspicion
which
at
once
settles
down
on
these
letters
their
advocates
are
aware
of
the
chronological
objection
and
they
have
accordingly
expended
immense
pains
in
trying
to
prove
that
eusebius
jerome
and
other
writers
of
the
highest
repute
have
been
mistaken
in
his
recent
work
the
bishop
of
durham
has
exhausted
the
resources
of
his
ability
and
erudition
in
attempting
to
demonstrate
that
the
only
parties
from
whom
we
can
fairly
expect
anything
like
evidence
have
all
been
misinformed
he
has
secured
a
verdict
in
his
favour
from
a
number
of
reviewers
who
have
apparently
at
once
given
way
before
the
formidable
array
of
learned
lore
brought
together
in
these
volumes
but
withal
the
intelligent
reader
who
cautiously
peruses
and
ponders
the
elaborate
chapter
in
which
he
deals
with
this
question
will
feel
rather
mystified
than
enlightened
by
his
argumentation
it
may
therefore
be
proper
to
state
the
testimony
of
the
ancient
christian
writers
and
to
describe
the
line
of
reasoning
pursued
by
lightfoot
the
main
source
of
opinion
says
the
bishop
respecting
the
year
of
polycarp
death
among
ancient
and
modern
writers
alike
has
been
the
of
eusebius
after
the
seventh
year
of
aurelius
he
appends
the
notice
persecution
overtaking
the
church
polycarp
underwent
martyrdom
eusebius
is
here
assumed
to
date
martyrdom
in
the
seventh
year
of
aurelius
lightfoot
then
proceeds
to
observe
that
this
inference
is
unwarrantable
inasmuch
as
the
notice
is
not
placed
opposite
to
but
this
he
adds
that
it
is
associated
with
the
persecutions
in
vienne
and
lyons
which
we
know
to
have
happened
so
far
the
statement
of
the
bishop
is
unobjectionable
and
according
to
his
own
showing
we
might
conclude
that
polycarp
suffered
some
time
after
the
seventh
year
of
aurelius
but
this
plain
logical
deduction
would
be
totally
ruinous
to
the
system
of
chronology
which
he
advocates
and
he
is
obliged
to
resort
to
a
most
outlandish
assumption
that
he
may
get
over
the
difficulty
he
contends
that
eusebius
did
not
know
at
what
precise
period
these
martyrdoms
occurred
we
can
says
the
bishop
only
infer
with
safety
that
eusebius
polycarp
martyrdom
to
have
happened
the
of
m
aurelius
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
gallican
persecutions
took
place
some
ten
years
later
than
and
therefore
so
far
as
this
notice
goes
the
martyrdom
of
polycarp
might
have
taken
place
many
years
these
extracts
may
give
the
reader
some
idea
of
the
manner
in
which
lightfoot
proceeds
to
build
up
his
chronological
edifice
eusebius
places
the
martyrdom
of
polycarp
and
the
martyrdoms
of
vienne
and
lyons
after
the
seventh
year
of
aurelius
and
therefore
argues
lightfoot
he
did
not
know
when
they
occurred
because
the
martyrdoms
of
vienne
and
lyons
took
place
ten
years
after
therefore
the
martyrdom
at
smyrna
may
for
anything
that
the
father
of
ecclesiastical
history
could
tell
have
been
consummated
in
lightfoot
himself
supplies
proof
that
such
an
inference
is
inadmissible
for
he
acknowledges
that
according
to
eusebius
the
pastor
of
smyrna
finished
his
career
in
the
reign
of
aurelius
but
in
aurelius
was
not
emperor
such
are
the
contradictions
to
which
this
writer
commits
himself
in
attempting
to
change
the
times
and
the
seasons
it
is
quite
clear
that
eusebius
laboured
under
no
such
uncertainty
as
lightfoot
would
fondly
persuade
himself
relative
to
the
date
of
the
martyrdom
of
polycarp
he
directs
attention
to
the
subject
in
his
as
well
as
in
his
and
in
both
his
testimony
is
to
the
same
effect
in
both
it
is
alleged
that
polycarp
was
martyred
in
the
reign
of
marcus
aurelius
it
must
be
remembered
too
that
eusebius
was
born
only
about
a
century
after
the
event
that
from
his
youth
he
had
devoted
himself
to
ecclesiastical
studies
that
he
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
access
to
the
best
theological
libraries
in
existence
in
his
day
that
from
his
position
in
the
church
as
bishop
of
the
metropolis
of
palestine
and
as
the
confidential
counselor
of
the
emperor
constantine
he
had
opportunities
of
coming
into
personal
contact
with
persons
of
distinction
from
all
countries
who
must
have
been
well
acquainted
with
the
traditions
of
their
respective
churches
and
that
he
was
a
man
of
rare
prudence
intelligence
and
discernment
he
was
certainly
not
a
philosophical
historian
and
in
his
great
work
he
has
omitted
to
notice
many
things
of
much
moment
but
it
must
be
conceded
that
generally
speaking
he
is
an
accurate
recorder
of
facts
and
in
the
case
before
us
he
was
under
no
temptation
whatever
to
make
a
misleading
statement
we
must
also
recollect
that
his
testimony
is
corroborated
by
jerome
who
lived
in
the
same
century
who
at
least
in
two
places
in
his
writings
reports
the
martyrdom
and
who
affirms
that
it
occurred
in
the
seventh
year
of
aurelius
lightfoot
indeed
asserts
that
jerome
derived
his
knowledge
from
eusebius
and
that
though
well
versed
in
works
of
biblical
exegesis
he
was
otherwise
of
early
christian
literature
we
have
here
unhappily
another
of
those
rash
utterances
in
which
the
bishop
of
durham
indulges
throughout
these
volumes
for
assuredly
it
is
the
very
extravagance
of
folly
to
tax
jerome
with
extreme
ignorance
of
early
christian
literature
those
who
are
acquainted
with
his
writings
will
decline
to
subscribe
any
such
depreciatory
certificate
he
was
undoubtedly
bigoted
and
but
he
had
a
most
capacious
memory
he
had
travelled
in
various
countries
he
had
gathered
a
prodigious
stock
of
information
he
was
the
best
christian
scholar
of
his
generation
he
has
preserved
for
us
the
knowledge
of
not
a
few
important
facts
which
eusebius
has
not
registered
and
he
at
one
time
contemplated
undertaking
himself
the
composition
of
an
ecclesiastical
history
we
can
not
therefore
regard
him
as
the
mere
copyist
of
the
bishop
of
caesarea
every
one
acquainted
with
the
literature
of
the
primitive
church
says
döllinger
knows
that
it
is
precisely
in
jerome
that
we
find
more
exact
knowledge
of
the
more
ancient
of
the
church
and
that
we
are
indebted
to
him
for
more
information
about
their
teaching
and
writings
than
to
any
other
of
the
latin
fathers
döllinger
is
a
church
historian
whom
even
the
bishop
of
durham
can
not
afford
to
ignore
as
in
his
own
field
of
study
he
has
perhaps
no
peer
in
existence
and
yet
he
here
states
explicitly
not
certainly
that
jerome
was
extremely
ignorant
of
early
christian
literature
but
that
in
this
very
department
he
was
specially
well
informed
the
learned
monk
of
bethlehem
must
have
felt
a
deep
interest
in
polycarp
as
an
apostolic
father
he
was
quite
capable
of
testing
the
worth
of
the
evidence
relative
to
the
time
of
the
martyrdom
and
his
endorsement
of
the
statement
of
eusebius
must
be
accepted
as
a
testimony
entitled
to
very
grave
consideration
some
succeeding
writers
assign
even
a
later
period
to
the
death
of
polycarp
it
is
a
weighty
fact
that
no
christian
author
for
the
first
eight
centuries
of
our
era
places
it
before
the
reign
of
aurelius
the
first
writer
who
attaches
to
it
an
earlier
date
is
georgius
hamartolus
who
flourished
about
the
middle
of
the
ninth
century
lightfoot
confesses
that
what
he
says
can
not
be
received
as
based
on
any
historical
tradition
or
critical
investigation
it
is
in
fact
utterly
worthless
the
manner
in
which
lightfoot
tries
to
meet
the
array
of
evidence
opposed
to
him
is
somewhat
extraordinary
he
does
not
attempt
to
show
that
it
is
improbable
in
itself
or
that
there
are
any
rebutting
depositions
he
leaves
it
in
its
undiminished
strength
but
he
raises
such
a
cloud
of
learned
dust
around
it
that
the
reader
may
well
lose
his
head
and
be
unable
for
a
time
to
see
the
old
chronological
landmarks
he
rests
his
case
chiefly
on
a
statement
to
be
found
in
a
postscript
of
admittedly
doubtful
authority
appended
to
the
letter
of
the
smyrnaeans
relative
to
the
martyrdom
of
polycarp
he
argues
as
if
the
authority
for
this
statement
were
unimpeachable
and
evidently
regarding
it
as
the
very
key
of
the
position
he
endeavours
by
means
of
it
to
upset
the
chronology
of
eusebius
jerome
the
and
other
witnesses
as
the
reader
peruses
his
chapter
on
the
date
of
the
martyrdom
he
can
not
but
feel
that
the
evidence
presented
to
him
is
bewildering
indecisive
and
obscure
and
it
may
occur
to
him
that
the
author
is
very
like
an
individual
who
proposes
to
determine
the
value
of
two
or
three
unknown
quantities
from
one
simple
algebraic
equation
his
principal
witness
aristides
were
he
now
living
and
brought
up
in
presence
of
a
jury
would
find
himself
in
rather
an
odd
predicament
he
is
expected
to
settle
the
date
of
the
death
of
polycarp
and
yet
he
knows
nothing
either
of
the
pastor
of
smyrna
or
of
his
tragic
end
it
does
not
appear
that
he
had
ever
heard
of
the
worthy
apostolic
father
aristides
was
a
rhetorician
who
has
left
behind
him
certain
orations
entitled
written
in
praise
of
the
god
aesculapius
it
might
be
thought
that
such
a
writer
is
but
poorly
qualified
to
decide
a
disputed
question
of
chronology
our
readers
may
have
heard
of
papias
one
of
the
early
fathers
noted
for
the
imbecility
of
his
intellect
aristides
it
seems
was
quite
as
liable
to
imposition
the
credulity
of
a
papias
says
lightfoot
is
more
than
matched
by
the
credulity
of
an
aristides
such
is
the
bishop
leading
witness
aristides
was
an
invalid
and
a
hypochondriac
and
in
the
discourses
he
has
left
behind
him
he
describes
the
course
of
a
long
illness
with
an
account
of
his
pains
aches
purgations
dreams
and
visions
interspersed
from
time
to
time
with
what
lightfoot
estimates
as
valuable
chronological
notices
the
reader
may
be
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
it
happens
that
this
eccentric
character
has
been
brought
forward
as
a
witness
to
the
date
of
the
martyrdom
of
polycarp
he
has
been
introduced
under
the
following
circumstances
in
the
postscript
to
the
smyrnaean
letter
an
appendage
of
very
doubtful
authority
we
are
told
that
the
martyrdom
occurred
when
statius
quadratus
was
proconsul
of
asia
from
certain
incidental
allusions
made
by
aristides
in
his
discourses
the
bishop
labours
hard
to
prove
that
this
statius
quadratus
was
proconsul
of
asia
somewhere
about
the
evidence
is
not
very
clear
or
well
authenticated
and
we
have
reason
to
fear
that
very
little
reliance
can
be
placed
on
the
declarations
of
this
afflicted
rhetorician
his
sickness
is
said
to
have
lasted
seventeen
years
and
it
is
possible
that
meanwhile
his
memory
as
to
dates
may
have
been
somewhat
impaired
lightfoot
can
not
exactly
tell
when
his
sickness
commenced
or
when
it
terminated
but
he
has
ascertained
that
this
quadratus
was
consul
in
and
by
weighing
probabilities
as
to
the
length
of
the
interval
which
may
have
elapsed
before
he
became
proconsul
he
has
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
might
have
amounted
to
twelve
or
thirteen
years
nothing
however
can
be
more
unsatisfactory
than
the
process
by
which
he
has
reached
this
result
according
to
the
usual
routine
an
individual
advanced
to
the
consulate
became
in
a
number
of
years
afterwards
a
proconsul
and
yet
as
everything
depended
on
the
will
of
the
emperor
it
was
impossible
to
tell
how
long
he
might
have
to
wait
for
the
appointment
he
might
obtain
it
in
five
years
or
perhaps
sooner
if
an
exceptionally
able
man
or
he
might
be
kept
in
expectancy
for
eighteen
or
nineteen
years
the
proconsulship
commonly
terminated
in
a
year
but
an
individual
might
be
retained
in
the
office
for
five
or
six
years
he
might
become
consul
a
second
time
and
then
possibly
he
might
again
be
made
proconsul
lightfoot
as
we
have
seen
has
proved
that
statius
quadratus
was
consul
in
and
then
by
the
aid
of
the
dreamer
aristides
he
has
tried
to
show
that
he
probably
became
proconsul
of
asia
about
or
his
calculations
are
obviously
mere
guesswork
even
admitting
their
correctness
it
would
by
no
means
follow
that
polycarp
was
then
consigned
to
martyrdom
the
postscript
of
the
smyrnaean
letter
is
as
we
have
seen
justly
suspected
as
no
part
of
the
original
document
lightfoot
himself
tells
us
that
it
is
treated
as
a
later
addition
to
the
letter
and
as
coming
from
a
different
hand
and
whilst
disposed
to
uphold
its
claims
as
of
high
authority
he
admits
that
when
tested
as
to
external
evidence
the
supplementary
paragraphs
of
which
this
is
one
do
not
stand
on
the
same
ground
as
the
rest
of
the
epistle
and
yet
his
whole
chronology
rests
on
the
supposition
that
the
name
of
the
proconsul
is
correctly
given
in
this
probably
apocryphal
addition
to
the
smyrnaean
letter
were
we
even
to
grant
that
this
postscript
belonged
originally
to
the
document
it
would
supply
no
conclusive
evidence
that
polycarp
was
martyred
in
it
is
far
more
probable
that
the
writer
has
been
slightly
inaccurate
as
to
the
exact
designation
of
the
proconsul
of
asia
about
the
time
of
the
martyrdom
he
was
called
quadratus
not
perhaps
but
possibly
there
is
nothing
more
common
among
ourselves
than
to
make
such
a
mistake
as
to
a
name
how
often
may
we
find
john
put
for
james
or
robert
for
andrew
quadratus
was
a
patrician
name
well
known
all
over
the
empire
and
if
statius
quadratus
had
not
long
before
been
proconsul
of
asia
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
writer
of
this
postscript
may
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
the
proconsul
about
the
time
of
polycarp
death
was
the
same
individual
the
author
whoever
he
may
have
been
was
probably
not
very
well
acquainted
with
these
roman
dignitaries
and
may
thus
have
readily
fallen
into
the
error
lightfoot
has
himself
recorded
a
case
in
which
a
similar
mistake
has
been
made
not
in
an
ordinary
communication
such
its
this
but
in
an
imperial
ordinance
in
a
rescript
of
the
emperor
hadrian
granianus
the
proconsul
is
styled
granianus
if
such
a
blunder
could
be
perpetrated
in
an
official
state
document
need
we
wonder
if
the
penman
of
the
postscript
of
the
smyrnaean
letter
has
written
statius
quadratus
for
ummidius
quadratus
and
yet
if
we
admit
this
very
likely
oversight
the
whole
chronological
edifice
which
the
bishop
of
durham
has
been
at
such
vast
pains
to
construct
vanishes
like
the
dreams
and
visions
of
his
leading
witness
the
hypochondriac
aristides
archbishop
ussher
and
others
who
have
carefully
investigated
the
subject
have
placed
in
the
martyrdom
of
polycarp
the
following
reasons
may
be
assigned
why
this
date
is
decidedly
preferable
to
that
contended
for
by
lightfoot
all
the
surrounding
circumstances
point
to
the
reign
of
marcus
aurelius
as
the
date
of
the
martyrdom
eusebius
has
preserved
an
edict
said
to
have
been
issued
by
antoninus
pius
in
which
he
announces
that
he
had
written
to
the
governors
of
provinces
not
to
trouble
the
christians
at
all
unless
they
appeared
to
make
attempts
against
the
roman
government
doubts
it
may
be
well
founded
have
been
entertained
as
to
the
genuineness
of
this
ordinance
but
it
has
been
pretty
generally
acknowledged
that
it
fairly
indicates
the
policy
of
antoninus
pius
though
certainly
spurious
says
lightfoot
it
represents
the
conception
of
him
entertained
by
christians
in
the
generations
next
succeeding
his
own
in
his
reign
the
disciples
of
our
lord
according
to
the
declarations
of
their
own
apologists
were
treated
with
special
indulgence
melito
for
example
who
wrote
not
long
after
the
middle
of
the
second
century
bears
this
testimony
capitolinus
an
author
who
flourished
about
the
close
of
the
third
century
reports
that
antoninus
pius
lived
without
bloodshed
either
of
citizen
or
foe
during
his
reign
of
years
lightfoot
strives
again
and
again
to
evade
the
force
of
this
evidence
and
absurdly
quotes
the
sufferings
of
polycarp
and
his
companions
as
furnishing
a
contradiction
but
he
thus
only
takes
for
granted
what
he
has
elsewhere
failed
to
prove
he
admits
at
the
same
time
that
this
case
stands
alone
only
recorded
says
he
in
proconsular
asia
during
his
reign
that
of
antoninus
pius
are
those
of
polycarp
and
his
companions
it
must
however
be
obvious
that
he
can
not
establish
even
this
exception
we
have
seen
that
the
chronology
supported
by
the
bishop
of
durham
is
at
variance
with
the
express
statements
of
all
the
early
christian
writers
and
certain
facts
mentioned
in
the
letter
of
the
smyrnaeans
concur
to
demonstrate
its
inaccuracy
the
description
there
given
of
the
sufferings
endured
by
those
of
whom
it
speaks
supplies
abundant
evidence
that
the
martyrdoms
must
have
happened
in
the
time
of
marcus
aurelius
lightfoot
himself
attests
that
persecutions
extended
throughout
this
reign
that
they
were
fierce
and
deliberate
and
that
they
were
by
cruel
such
precisely
were
the
barbarities
reported
in
this
epistle
it
states
that
the
martyrs
were
so
torn
by
lashes
that
the
mechanism
of
their
flesh
was
visible
even
as
far
as
the
inward
veins
and
arteries
that
notwithstanding
they
were
enabled
to
endure
the
fire
and
that
those
who
were
finally
condemned
to
the
wild
beasts
meanwhile
suffered
fearful
punishments
made
to
lie
on
sharp
shells
and
buffeted
with
other
forms
of
manifold
these
words
attest
that
before
the
christians
were
put
to
death
various
expedients
were
employed
to
extort
from
them
a
recantation
such
was
the
mode
of
treatment
recommended
by
marcus
aurelius
in
an
edict
issued
against
those
who
professed
the
gospel
by
this
emperor
we
have
the
following
directions
let
them
be
arrested
and
unless
they
offer
to
the
gods
them
be
punished
with
divers
various
means
says
neander
were
employed
to
constrain
them
to
a
renunciation
of
their
faith
and
only
in
the
last
extremity
when
they
could
not
be
forced
to
submit
was
the
punishment
of
death
to
be
inflicted
this
undoubtedly
was
the
inauguration
of
a
new
system
of
persecution
in
former
times
the
christians
who
refused
to
apostatize
were
summarily
consigned
to
execution
now
they
were
horribly
tormented
in
various
ways
with
a
view
to
compel
them
to
abandon
their
religion
this
new
policy
is
characteristic
of
the
reign
of
marcus
aurelius
nothing
akin
to
it
sanctioned
by
imperial
authority
can
be
found
in
the
time
of
any
preceding
emperor
its
employment
now
in
the
case
of
polycarp
and
his
companions
fixes
the
date
of
the
martyrdom
to
this
reign
we
have
distinct
proof
that
the
visit
of
polycarp
to
rome
took
place
the
date
assigned
by
bishop
lightfoot
to
his
martyrdom
eusebius
tells
us
that
in
the
year
of
the
reign
of
antoninus
pius
telesphorus
of
rome
died
and
was
succeeded
in
his
charge
by
hyginus
he
subsequently
informs
us
that
hyginus
dying
the
fourth
year
of
his
office
was
succeeded
by
pius
and
he
then
adds
that
pius
dying
at
rome
in
the
year
of
his
episcopate
was
succeeded
by
anicetus
it
was
in
the
time
of
this
chief
pastor
that
polycarp
paid
his
visit
to
the
imperial
city
it
is
apparent
from
the
foregoing
statements
that
anicetus
could
not
have
entered
on
his
office
until
at
least
nineteen
or
perhaps
twenty
years
after
antoninus
pius
became
emperor
that
is
until
or
possibly
until
this
however
is
two
or
three
years
after
the
date
assigned
by
lightfoot
for
the
martyrdom
surely
the
bishop
of
durham
would
not
have
us
to
believe
that
polycarp
reappeared
in
rome
two
or
three
years
after
he
expired
on
the
funeral
pile
and
yet
it
is
only
by
some
such
desperate
supposition
that
he
can
make
his
chronology
square
with
the
history
of
the
apostolic
father
it
is
not
at
all
probable
that
polycarp
arrived
in
rome
immediately
after
the
appointment
of
anicetus
as
chief
pastor
the
account
of
his
visit
as
given
by
irenaeus
rather
suggests
that
a
considerable
time
must
meanwhile
have
elapsed
before
he
made
his
appearance
there
it
would
seem
that
he
had
been
disturbed
by
reports
which
had
reached
him
relative
to
innovations
with
which
anicetus
was
identified
and
that
apprehending
mischief
to
the
whole
christian
community
from
anything
going
amiss
in
a
church
of
such
importance
he
was
prompted
at
his
advanced
age
to
undertake
so
formidable
a
journey
in
the
hope
that
by
the
weight
of
his
personal
influence
with
his
brethren
in
the
imperial
city
he
might
be
able
to
arrest
the
movement
it
is
not
necessary
now
to
inquire
more
particularly
what
led
the
venerable
asiatic
presbyter
at
this
period
to
travel
all
the
way
from
smyrna
to
the
seat
of
empire
it
is
enough
for
us
to
know
as
regards
the
question
before
us
that
it
took
place
sometime
during
the
pastorate
of
anicetus
that
polycarp
effected
much
good
by
his
dealings
with
errorists
when
in
rome
and
that
its
chief
christian
minister
by
his
tact
and
discretion
succeeded
in
quieting
the
fears
of
the
aged
stranger
that
the
visit
occurred
long
after
the
date
assigned
by
lightfoot
for
his
martyrdom
may
now
be
evident
and
in
a
former
chapter
proof
has
been
adduced
to
show
that
it
must
be
dated
not
as
the
bishop
of
durham
argues
about
but
in
neither
is
there
any
evidence
whatever
that
polycarp
was
put
to
death
immediately
after
his
return
to
smyrna
this
supposition
is
absolutely
necessary
to
give
even
an
appearance
of
plausibility
to
the
bishop
chronology
but
he
has
not
been
able
to
furnish
so
much
as
a
solitary
reason
for
its
adoption
we
have
good
grounds
for
believing
that
the
martyrdom
of
polycarp
occurred
not
earlier
than
this
date
fulfils
better
than
any
other
the
conditions
enumerated
in
the
letter
of
the
smyrnaeans
archbishop
ussher
has
been
at
pains
to
show
that
the
month
and
day
there
mentioned
precisely
correspond
to
and
verify
this
reckoning
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
repeat
his
calculations
but
it
is
right
to
notice
another
item
spoken
of
in
the
smyrnaean
epistle
supplying
an
additional
confirmatory
proof
which
the
bishop
of
durham
can
not
well
ignore
when
polycarp
was
pressed
to
apostatize
by
the
officials
who
had
him
in
custody
they
pleaded
with
him
as
if
anxious
to
save
his
life
why
what
harm
is
there
in
saying
is
and
offering
incense
and
they
urged
him
to
by
the
genius
of
these
words
suggest
that
at
the
time
of
this
transaction
the
roman
world
had
only
one
emperor
in
january
verus
died
after
recording
this
event
in
his
lightfoot
adds
aurelius
is
now
when
he
is
contending
for
as
the
date
of
the
martyrdom
he
lays
much
stress
on
the
fact
that
throughout
this
smyrnaean
letter
is
used
of
the
emperor
polycarp
he
says
is
urged
to
declare
is
lord
he
is
bidden
and
he
refuses
to
swear
by
the
of
caesar
it
is
he
adds
at
least
a
matter
of
surprise
that
these
forms
should
be
persistently
used
if
the
event
had
happened
a
divided
the
bishop
can
not
at
this
stage
of
the
discussion
decently
refuse
to
recognise
the
potency
of
his
own
argument
the
three
reasons
just
enumerated
show
conclusively
that
for
which
the
bishop
of
durham
contends
so
strenuously
can
not
be
accepted
as
the
date
of
the
martyrdom
for
some
years
after
this
anicetus
was
not
placed
at
the
head
of
the
church
of
the
imperial
city
and
he
must
have
been
for
a
considerable
time
in
that
position
when
polycarp
paid
his
visit
to
rome
we
have
seen
that
the
aged
pastor
of
smyrna
suffered
in
the
reign
of
marcus
aurelius
and
that
is
the
earliest
period
to
which
we
can
refer
the
martyrdom
inasmuch
as
that
was
the
first
year
in
which
marcus
aurelius
was
sole
emperor
all
the
reliable
chronological
indications
point
to
this
as
the
more
correct
reckoning
it
has
now
we
believe
been
demonstrated
by
a
series
of
solid
and
concurring
testimonies
that
archbishop
ussher
made
no
mistake
when
he
fixed
on
as
the
proper
date
of
polycarp
martyrdom
the
bearing
of
this
conclusion
on
the
question
of
the
ignatian
epistles
must
at
once
be
apparent
polycarp
was
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
it
follows
that
in
or
years
before
when
the
ignatian
letters
are
alleged
to
have
been
dictated
he
was
only
the
absurdity
of
believing
that
at
such
an
age
he
wrote
the
epistle
to
the
philippians
or
that
another
apostolic
father
would
then
have
addressed
him
in
the
style
employed
in
the
ignatian
correspondence
must
be
plain
to
every
reader
of
ordinary
intelligence
no
wonder
that
the
advocates
of
the
genuineness
of
these
epistles
have
called
into
requisition
such
an
enormous
amount
of
ingenuity
and
erudition
to
pervert
the
chronology
pearson
as
we
have
seen
spent
six
years
in
this
service
and
the
learned
bishop
of
durham
has
been
engaged
off
and
on
for
nearly
thirty
in
the
same
labour
at
the
close
of
his
long
task
he
seems
to
have
persuaded
himself
that
he
has
been
quite
successful
and
speaking
of
the
theory
of
cureton
he
adopts
a
tone
of
triumph
and
exclaims
i
venture
to
hope
that
the
discussion
which
follows
will
extinguish
the
last
sparks
of
its
waning
life
it
remains
for
the
candid
reader
to
ponder
the
statements
submitted
to
him
in
this
chapter
and
to
determine
how
many
sparks
of
life
now
remain
in
the
bishop
chronology
chapter
iv
the
testimony
of
irenaeus
and
the
genesis
of
prelacy
testimony
of
the
only
two
vouchers
of
the
second
century
produced
in
support
of
the
claims
of
the
epistles
attributed
to
ignatius
are
the
letter
of
polycarp
to
the
philippians
and
a
sentence
from
the
treatise
of
irenaeus
the
evidence
from
polycarp
epistle
has
been
discussed
in
a
preceding
chapter
when
examined
it
has
completely
broken
down
as
it
is
based
on
an
entire
misconception
of
the
meaning
of
the
writer
the
words
of
irenaeus
can
be
adduced
with
still
less
plausibility
to
uphold
the
credit
of
these
letters
the
following
is
the
passage
in
which
they
are
supposed
to
be
authenticated
of
our
people
when
condemned
to
the
beasts
on
account
of
his
testimony
towards
god
i
am
the
wheat
of
god
i
am
also
ground
by
the
teeth
of
beasts
that
i
may
be
found
the
pure
bread
of
god
it
is
worse
than
a
mere
begging
of
the
question
to
assert
that
irenaeus
here
gives
us
a
quotation
from
one
of
the
letters
of
ignatius
in
the
extensive
treatise
from
which
the
words
are
an
extract
he
never
once
mentions
the
name
of
the
pastor
of
antioch
had
he
been
aware
of
the
existence
of
these
epistles
he
would
undoubtedly
have
availed
himself
of
their
assistance
when
contending
against
the
heretics
as
they
would
have
furnished
him
with
many
passages
exactly
suited
for
their
refutation
the
words
of
a
man
taught
by
the
apostles
occupying
one
of
the
highest
positions
in
the
christian
church
and
finishing
his
career
by
a
glorious
martyrdom
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
second
century
would
have
been
by
far
the
weightiest
evidence
he
could
have
produced
next
to
the
teaching
of
inspiration
but
though
he
brings
forward
clemens
romanus
papias
justin
martyr
polycarp
and
others
to
confront
the
errorists
he
ignores
a
witness
whose
antiquity
and
weight
of
character
would
have
imparted
peculiar
significance
to
his
testimony
to
say
that
though
he
never
names
him
elsewhere
he
points
to
him
in
this
place
as
one
of
our
people
is
to
make
a
very
bold
and
improbable
statement
even
the
apostle
paul
himself
would
not
have
ventured
to
describe
the
evangelist
john
in
this
way
he
would
have
alluded
to
him
more
respectfully
neither
would
the
pastor
of
a
comparatively
uninfluential
church
in
the
south
of
gaul
have
expressed
himself
after
this
fashion
when
speaking
of
a
minister
who
had
been
one
of
the
most
famous
of
the
spiritual
heroes
of
the
church
not
many
years
before
a
terrific
persecution
had
raged
in
his
own
city
of
lyons
many
had
been
put
in
prison
and
some
had
been
thrown
to
wild
beasts
and
it
is
obviously
to
one
of
these
anonymous
sufferers
that
irenaeus
here
directs
attention
the
one
of
our
people
is
not
certainly
an
apostolic
father
but
some
citizen
of
lyons
moving
in
a
different
sphere
whose
name
the
author
does
not
deem
it
necessary
to
enrol
in
the
record
of
history
neither
is
it
to
a
correspondence
but
to
the
of
the
unknown
martyr
to
which
he
adverts
when
we
read
one
of
our
people
as
i
am
the
wheat
of
god
i
am
also
ground
by
the
teeth
of
beasts
that
i
may
be
found
the
pure
bread
of
god
the
two
witnesses
of
the
second
century
who
are
supposed
to
uphold
the
claims
of
the
ignatian
epistles
have
now
been
examined
and
it
must
be
apparent
that
their
testimony
amounts
to
nothing
thus
far
then
there
is
no
external
evidence
whatever
in
favour
of
these
letters
the
result
of
this
investigation
warrants
the
suspicion
that
they
are
forgeries
the
internal
evidence
abundantly
confirms
this
impression
any
one
who
carefully
peruses
them
and
then
reads
over
the
epistle
of
clemens
romanus
the
teaching
of
the
apostles
the
writings
of
justin
martyr
and
the
epistle
of
polycarp
may
see
that
the
works
just
named
are
the
productions
of
quite
another
period
the
ignatian
letters
describe
a
state
of
things
which
they
totally
ignore
lightfoot
himself
has
been
at
pains
to
point
out
the
wonderful
difference
between
the
ignatian
correspondence
and
the
epistle
of
polycarp
in
whatever
way
says
he
we
test
the
documents
the
contrast
is
very
striking
more
striking
indeed
than
we
should
have
expected
to
find
between
two
christian
writers
who
lived
at
the
same
time
and
were
personally
acquainted
with
each
other
he
then
proceeds
to
mention
some
of
the
points
of
contrast
whilst
the
ignatius
lays
stress
on
episcopacy
as
the
of
the
ecclesiastical
order
polycarp
in
his
epistle
from
first
to
last
makes
no
mention
of
the
episcopate
and
the
bishop
is
entirely
ignored
in
regard
to
doctrinal
statement
the
same
contrariety
is
apparent
ignatius
speaks
of
the
blood
of
god
and
the
passion
of
my
god
whilst
no
such
language
is
used
by
polycarp
again
in
the
letter
of
the
pastor
of
smyrna
there
is
an
entire
absence
of
that
sacramental
language
which
confronts
us
again
and
again
in
the
most
startling
forms
in
ignatius
though
the
seven
ignatian
letters
are
many
times
longer
than
epistle
the
quotations
in
the
latter
are
incomparably
more
numerous
as
well
as
more
precise
than
in
the
former
in
the
ignatian
letters
of
quotations
from
the
new
testament
strictly
speaking
there
is
none
of
all
the
fathers
of
the
church
early
or
later
no
one
is
more
incisive
or
more
persistent
in
advocating
the
claims
of
the
threefold
ministry
to
allegiance
than
ignatius
polycarp
on
the
other
hand
has
written
a
letter
which
has
proved
a
stronghold
of
presbyterianism
and
yet
lightfoot
would
have
us
to
believe
that
these
various
letters
were
written
by
two
ministers
living
at
the
same
time
taught
by
the
same
instructors
holding
the
closest
intercourse
with
each
other
professing
the
same
doctrines
and
adhering
to
the
same
ecclesiastical
arrangements
the
features
of
distinction
between
the
teaching
of
the
ignatian
letters
and
the
teaching
of
polycarp
which
have
been
pointed
out
by
lightfoot
himself
are
sufficiently
striking
but
his
lordship
has
not
exhibited
nearly
the
full
amount
of
the
contrast
ignatius
is
described
as
offering
himself
voluntarily
that
he
may
suffer
as
a
martyr
and
as
telling
those
to
whom
he
writes
that
his
supreme
desire
is
to
be
devoured
by
the
lions
at
rome
i
desire
says
he
to
fight
with
wild
beasts
may
i
have
joy
of
the
beasts
that
have
been
prepared
for
me
i
will
entice
them
that
they
may
devour
me
promptly
though
i
desire
to
suffer
yet
i
know
not
whether
i
am
worthy
i
delivered
myself
over
to
death
i
bid
all
men
know
that
of
my
own
free
will
i
die
for
god
the
church
instructed
by
polycarp
condemns
this
insane
ambition
for
martyrdom
we
praise
not
those
say
the
smyrnaeans
who
deliver
themselves
up
the
gospel
does
not
so
teach
in
these
letters
ignatius
speaks
as
a
vain
babbler
drunken
with
fanaticism
polycarp
in
his
epistle
expresses
himself
like
an
presbyterian
minister
in
his
sober
senses
ignatius
is
made
to
address
polycarp
as
if
he
were
a
prelate
and
tells
the
people
under
his
care
he
that
honoureth
the
bishop
is
honoured
of
god
he
that
doth
aught
against
the
knowledge
of
the
bishop
rendereth
service
to
the
devil
polycarp
on
the
other
hand
describes
himself
as
one
of
the
elders
and
exhorts
the
philippians
to
submit
to
the
presbyters
and
deacons
and
to
be
all
subject
one
to
another
when
their
church
had
got
into
a
state
of
confusion
and
when
they
applied
to
him
for
advice
he
recommended
them
to
walk
in
the
commandment
of
the
lord
and
admonished
their
presbyters
to
be
compassionate
and
merciful
towards
all
men
never
hinting
that
the
appointment
of
a
bishop
would
help
to
keep
them
in
order
whereas
when
ignatius
addresses
various
churches
that
of
the
smyrnaeans
included
he
assumes
a
tone
of
high
churchmanship
which
archbishop
laud
himself
would
have
been
afraid
and
perhaps
ashamed
to
emulate
as
many
as
are
of
god
and
of
jesus
christ
says
he
they
are
with
the
bishop
it
is
good
to
recognise
god
and
the
bishop
give
ye
heed
to
the
bishop
that
god
may
also
give
heed
to
you
the
internal
evidence
furnished
by
the
ignatian
epistles
seals
their
condemnation
i
do
not
intend
however
at
present
to
pursue
this
subject
in
a
work
published
by
me
six
and
twenty
years
ago
i
have
called
attention
to
various
circumstances
which
betray
the
imposture
and
neither
lightfoot
zahn
nor
any
one
else
so
far
as
i
am
aware
has
ever
yet
ventured
to
deal
with
my
arguments
i
might
now
add
new
evidences
of
their
fabrication
but
i
deem
this
unnecessary
i
can
not
however
pass
from
this
department
of
the
question
in
debate
without
protesting
against
the
view
presented
by
the
bishop
of
durham
of
the
origin
of
prelacy
it
is
shown
says
he
referring
to
his
on
the
christian
that
though
the
new
testament
itself
contains
as
yet
no
direct
and
indisputable
notices
of
a
localized
episcopate
in
the
gentile
churches
as
distinguished
from
the
moveable
episcopate
exercised
by
timothy
in
ephesus
and
by
titus
in
crete
yet
there
is
satisfactory
evidence
of
its
development
in
the
later
years
of
the
apostolic
age
and
that
in
the
early
years
of
the
second
century
the
episcopate
was
widely
spread
and
had
taken
firm
root
more
especially
in
asia
minor
and
in
syria
if
the
evidence
on
which
its
extension
in
the
regions
east
of
the
aegaean
at
this
epoch
be
resisted
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
single
fact
relating
to
the
history
of
the
christian
church
during
the
first
half
of
the
second
century
can
be
regarded
as
in
this
statement
as
well
as
in
not
a
few
others
already
submitted
to
the
reader
lightfoot
has
expressed
himself
with
an
amount
of
confidence
which
may
well
excite
astonishment
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
show
that
his
speculations
as
to
the
development
of
episcopacy
in
asia
minor
and
syria
in
the
early
years
of
the
second
century
as
presented
in
the
essay
to
which
he
refers
are
the
merest
moonshine
on
what
grounds
can
he
maintain
that
timothy
exercised
what
he
calls
a
moveable
episcopate
in
ephesus
paul
besought
him
to
abide
there
for
a
time
that
he
might
withstand
errorists
and
he
gave
him
instructions
as
to
how
he
was
to
behave
himself
in
the
house
of
god
but
it
did
not
therefore
follow
that
he
was
either
a
bishop
or
an
archbishop
he
was
an
able
man
sound
in
the
faith
wise
and
energetic
and
as
he
was
thus
a
host
in
himself
paul
expected
that
meanwhile
he
would
be
eminently
useful
in
helping
the
less
gifted
ministers
who
were
in
the
place
to
repress
error
and
keep
the
church
in
order
that
paul
intended
to
establish
neither
a
moveable
nor
an
immoveable
episcopate
in
ephesus
is
obvious
from
his
own
testimony
for
when
he
addresses
its
elders
as
he
believed
for
the
last
time
he
ignored
their
submission
to
any
ecclesiastical
superior
and
committed
the
church
to
their
own
supervision
and
if
he
left
titus
in
crete
to
take
charge
of
the
organization
of
the
church
there
he
certainly
did
not
intend
that
the
evangelist
was
to
act
alone
in
those
days
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
services
of
a
diocesan
bishop
inasmuch
as
the
christian
community
was
governed
by
the
common
council
of
the
elders
and
ordination
was
performed
with
the
laying
on
of
the
hands
of
the
presbytery
titus
was
a
master
builder
and
paul
believed
that
proceeding
in
concert
with
the
ministers
in
crete
he
would
render
effectual
aid
in
carrying
forward
the
erection
of
the
ecclesiastical
edifice
and
what
proof
has
lightfoot
produced
to
show
that
the
episcopate
was
widely
spread
in
asia
minor
and
in
syria
in
the
early
years
of
the
second
century
if
the
ignatian
epistles
be
discredited
he
has
none
at
all
but
there
is
very
decisive
evidence
to
the
contrary
the
teaching
of
the
apostles
the
shepherd
of
hermas
and
the
epistle
of
polycarp
prove
the
very
reverse
and
yet
lightfoot
is
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
single
fact
relating
to
the
history
of
the
christian
church
during
the
first
half
of
the
second
century
can
be
regarded
as
established
if
we
reject
his
baseless
assertion
genesis
of
jerome
gives
us
the
true
explanation
of
the
origin
of
the
episcopate
when
he
tells
us
that
it
was
set
up
with
a
view
to
prevent
divisions
in
the
church
these
divisions
were
created
chiefly
by
the
gnostics
who
swarmed
in
some
of
the
great
cities
of
the
empire
towards
the
middle
of
the
second
century
about
that
time
the
president
of
the
presbytery
was
in
a
few
places
armed
with
additional
authority
in
the
hope
that
he
would
thus
be
the
better
able
to
repress
schism
the
new
system
was
inaugurated
in
rome
and
its
church
has
ever
since
maintained
the
proud
boast
that
it
is
the
centre
of
ecclesiastical
unity
from
the
imperial
city
episcopacy
gradually
radiated
over
all
christendom
the
position
assumed
by
lightfoot
that
it
commenced
in
jerusalem
is
without
any
solid
foundation
to
support
it
he
is
obliged
to
adopt
the
fable
that
james
was
the
first
bishop
of
the
mother
church
the
new
testament
ignores
this
story
and
tells
us
explicitly
that
james
was
only
one
of
the
pillars
or
ruling
spirits
among
the
christians
of
the
jewish
capital
the
very
same
kind
of
argumentation
employed
to
establish
the
prelacy
of
james
may
be
used
with
far
greater
plausibility
to
demonstrate
the
primacy
of
peter
lightfoot
himself
acknowledges
that
about
the
close
of
the
first
century
we
can
not
find
a
trace
of
the
episcopate
in
either
of
the
two
great
christian
churches
of
rome
and
corinth
at
the
close
of
the
first
century
says
he
clement
writes
to
corinth
as
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
century
polycarp
writes
to
philippi
as
in
the
latter
epistle
so
in
the
former
there
is
no
allusion
to
the
episcopal
office
he
might
have
said
that
even
after
the
middle
of
the
second
century
it
did
not
exist
either
in
smyrna
or
philippi
he
admits
also
that
as
late
as
the
close
of
the
second
century
the
bishop
of
alexandria
was
regarded
as
distinct
and
yet
not
as
distinct
from
the
presbytery
the
first
bishop
of
alexandria
says
he
of
whom
any
distinct
incident
is
recorded
on
trustworthy
authority
was
a
contemporary
of
origen
who
flourished
in
the
third
century
lightfoot
tells
us
in
the
same
place
that
at
alexandria
the
bishop
was
nominated
and
apparently
ordained
by
the
twelve
presbyters
out
of
their
own
number
instead
of
asserting
as
has
been
done
that
no
single
fact
relating
to
the
history
of
the
christian
church
during
the
first
half
of
the
second
century
can
be
regarded
as
established
if
we
deny
that
the
episcopate
was
widely
spread
in
the
early
years
of
the
second
century
in
asia
minor
and
elsewhere
it
may
be
fearlessly
affirmed
that
at
the
date
here
mentioned
there
is
not
a
particle
of
proof
that
it
was
established
anywhere
irenaeus
could
have
given
an
account
of
the
genesis
of
episcopacy
for
he
lived
throughout
the
period
of
its
original
development
but
he
has
taken
care
not
to
lift
the
veil
which
covers
its
mysterious
commencement
he
could
have
told
what
prompted
polycarp
to
undertake
a
journey
to
rome
when
burthened
with
the
weight
of
years
but
he
has
left
us
to
our
own
surmises
it
is
however
significant
that
the
presbyterian
system
was
kept
up
in
smyrna
long
after
the
death
of
its
aged
martyr
lightfoot
has
well
observed
that
irenaeus
was
probably
the
most
learned
christian
of
his
time
and
it
is
pretty
clear
that
he
contributed
much
to
promote
the
acceptance
of
the
episcopal
theory
when
arguing
with
the
heretics
he
coined
the
doctrine
of
the
apostolical
succession
and
maintained
that
the
true
faith
was
propagated
to
his
own
age
through
an
unbroken
line
of
bishops
from
the
days
of
the
apostles
to
make
out
his
case
he
was
necessitated
to
speak
of
the
presidents
of
the
presbyteries
as
bishops
and
to
ignore
the
change
which
had
meanwhile
taken
place
in
the
ecclesiastical
constitution
subsequent
writers
followed
in
his
wake
and
thus
it
is
that
the
beginnings
of
episcopacy
have
been
enveloped
in
so
much
obscurity
even
in
rome
the
seat
of
the
most
prominent
church
in
christendom
it
is
impossible
to
settle
the
order
in
which
its
early
presiding
pastors
were
arranged
come
we
to
rome
says
stillingfleet
and
here
the
succession
is
as
muddy
as
the
tiber
itself
for
here
tertullian
rufinus
and
several
others
place
clement
next
to
peter
irenaeus
and
eusebius
set
anacletus
before
him
epiphanius
and
optatus
both
anacletus
and
cletus
augustinus
and
damasus
with
others
make
anacletus
cletus
and
linus
all
to
precede
him
what
way
shall
we
find
to
extricate
ourselves
out
of
this
labyrinth
the
different
lists
preserved
attest
that
there
was
no
such
continuous
and
homogeneous
line
of
bishops
as
the
doctrine
of
the
apostolical
succession
implies
when
irenaeus
speaks
of
polycarp
as
having
received
his
appointment
in
asia
from
apostles
as
bishop
in
the
church
of
smyrna
he
makes
a
statement
which
literally
understood
even
lightfoot
hesitates
to
endorse
the
apostle
john
may
have
seen
polycarp
in
his
boyhood
and
may
have
predicted
his
future
eminence
as
a
christian
minister
just
as
timothy
was
pointed
out
by
prophecy
as
destined
to
be
a
champion
of
the
faith
when
episcopacy
was
introduced
its
abettors
tried
to
manufacture
a
little
literary
capital
out
of
some
such
incident
but
the
allegation
that
polycarp
was
ordained
to
the
episcopal
office
by
the
apostles
is
a
fable
that
does
not
require
refutation
almost
all
of
them
were
dead
before
he
was
born
chapter
the
forgery
of
the
ignatian
epistles
if
as
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
the
ignatian
epistles
are
forgeries
from
beginning
to
end
various
questions
arise
as
to
the
time
of
their
appearance
and
the
circumstances
which
prompted
their
fabrication
their
origin
like
that
of
many
other
writings
of
the
same
description
can
not
be
satisfactorily
explored
and
we
must
in
vain
attempt
a
solution
of
all
the
objections
which
may
be
urged
against
almost
any
hypothesis
framed
to
elucidate
their
history
it
is
however
pretty
clear
that
in
their
original
form
they
first
saw
the
light
in
the
early
part
of
the
third
century
about
that
time
there
was
evidently
something
like
a
mania
for
the
composition
of
such
works
as
various
spurious
writings
attributed
to
clemens
romanus
and
others
abundantly
testify
their
authors
do
not
seem
to
have
been
aware
of
the
impropriety
of
committing
these
pious
frauds
and
may
even
have
imagined
that
they
were
thus
doing
god
service
several
circumstances
suggest
that
callistus
who
became
bishop
of
rome
about
may
before
his
advancement
to
the
episcopal
chair
have
had
a
hand
in
the
preparation
of
these
ignatian
epistles
his
history
is
remarkable
he
was
originally
a
slave
and
in
early
life
he
is
reported
to
have
been
the
child
of
misfortune
he
had
at
one
time
the
care
of
a
bank
in
the
management
of
which
he
did
not
prosper
he
was
at
length
banished
to
sardinia
to
labour
there
as
a
convict
in
the
mines
and
when
released
from
servitude
in
that
unhealthy
island
he
was
brought
under
the
notice
of
victor
the
roman
bishop
to
his
bounty
he
was
about
this
time
indebted
for
his
support
on
the
death
of
victor
callistus
became
a
prime
favourite
with
zephyrinus
the
succeeding
bishop
by
him
he
was
put
in
charge
of
the
cemetery
of
the
christians
connected
with
the
catacombs
and
he
soon
attained
the
most
influential
position
among
the
roman
clergy
so
great
was
his
popularity
that
on
the
demise
of
his
patron
he
was
himself
unanimously
chosen
to
the
episcopal
office
in
the
chief
city
of
the
empire
callistus
was
no
ordinary
man
he
was
a
kind
of
original
in
his
way
he
possessed
a
considerable
amount
of
literary
culture
he
took
a
prominent
part
in
the
current
theological
controversies
and
yet
if
we
are
to
believe
hippolytus
he
could
accommodate
himself
to
the
views
of
different
schools
of
doctrine
he
had
great
versatility
of
talent
restless
activity
deep
cunning
and
much
force
of
character
hippolytus
tells
us
that
he
was
sadly
given
to
intrigue
and
so
slippery
in
his
movements
that
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
entangle
him
in
a
dilemma
it
may
have
occurred
to
him
that
in
the
peculiar
position
of
the
church
the
concoction
of
a
series
of
letters
written
in
the
name
of
an
apostolic
father
and
vigorously
asserting
the
claims
of
the
bishops
would
help
much
to
strengthen
the
hands
of
the
hierarchy
he
might
thus
manage
at
the
same
time
quietly
to
commend
certain
favourite
views
of
doctrine
and
aid
the
pretensions
of
the
roman
chief
pastor
but
the
business
must
be
kept
a
profound
secret
and
the
letters
must
if
possible
be
so
framed
as
not
at
once
to
awaken
suspicion
if
we
carefully
examine
them
we
shall
find
that
they
were
well
fitted
to
escape
detection
at
the
time
when
they
were
written
the
internal
evidence
warrants
the
conclusion
that
the
epistle
to
the
romans
was
the
first
produced
it
came
forth
alone
and
if
it
crept
into
circulation
originally
in
the
imperial
city
it
was
not
likely
to
provoke
there
any
hostile
criticism
it
is
occupied
chiefly
with
giving
expression
to
the
personal
feelings
of
the
supposed
writer
in
the
prospect
of
martyrdom
it
scarcely
touches
on
the
question
of
ecclesiastical
regimen
and
it
closes
by
soliciting
the
prayers
of
the
roman
brethren
for
the
church
which
is
in
syria
if
says
lightfoot
ignatius
had
not
incidentally
mentioned
himself
as
the
bishop
or
syria
the
letter
to
the
romans
would
have
contained
no
indication
of
the
existence
of
the
episcopal
office
whilst
observing
this
studied
silence
on
the
subject
which
above
all
others
occupied
his
thoughts
the
writer
was
craftily
preparing
the
way
for
the
more
ready
reception
of
the
letters
which
were
to
follow
the
epistle
to
the
romans
tacitly
embodies
their
credentials
it
slyly
takes
advantage
of
the
connection
of
the
name
of
ignatius
with
syria
in
the
letter
of
polycarp
to
the
philippians
assumes
that
syria
is
the
eastern
province
and
represents
ignatius
as
a
bishop
from
that
part
of
the
empire
on
his
way
to
die
at
rome
it
does
not
venture
to
say
that
the
western
capital
had
then
a
bishop
of
its
own
for
the
epistle
of
clemens
which
was
probably
in
many
hands
and
which
ignored
the
episcopal
office
there
might
thus
have
suggested
doubts
as
to
its
genuineness
but
it
tells
the
sensational
story
of
the
journey
of
ignatius
in
chains
from
east
to
west
in
the
custody
of
what
are
called
ten
leopards
this
tale
at
the
time
was
likely
to
be
exceedingly
popular
ever
since
the
rise
of
montanism
which
made
its
appearance
about
the
time
of
the
death
of
polycarp
there
had
been
an
increasing
tendency
all
over
the
church
to
exaggerate
the
merits
of
martyrdom
this
tendency
reached
its
fullest
development
in
the
early
part
of
the
third
century
the
letter
of
ignatius
to
the
romans
exhibits
it
in
the
height
of
its
folly
ignatius
proclaims
his
most
earnest
desire
to
be
torn
to
pieces
by
the
lions
and
entreats
the
romans
not
to
interfere
and
deprive
him
of
a
privilege
which
he
coveted
so
ardently
the
words
reported
by
irenaeus
as
uttered
by
one
of
the
martyrs
of
lyons
are
adroitly
appropriated
by
the
as
if
spoken
by
himself
and
in
an
uncritical
age
when
the
of
the
communication
was
otherwise
so
much
to
the
taste
of
the
reader
the
quotation
helped
to
establish
the
credit
of
the
ignatian
correspondence
another
portion
of
the
letter
was
sure
to
be
extremely
acceptable
to
the
church
of
rome
for
here
the
writer
is
most
lavish
in
his
complimentary
acknowledgements
that
church
is
described
as
having
the
presidency
in
the
country
of
the
region
of
the
romans
being
worthy
of
god
worthy
of
honour
worthy
of
felicitation
worthy
of
praise
worthy
of
success
worthy
in
purity
and
having
the
presidency
of
love
filled
with
the
grace
of
god
without
wavering
and
filtered
clear
from
every
foreign
stain
the
epistle
to
the
romans
says
lightfoot
had
a
wider
popularity
than
the
other
letters
of
ignatius
both
early
and
late
it
appears
to
have
been
circulated
apart
from
them
sometimes
alone
it
was
put
forth
as
a
feeler
to
discover
how
the
public
would
be
disposed
to
entertain
such
a
correspondence
and
in
case
of
its
favourable
reception
it
was
intended
to
open
the
way
for
additional
epistles
it
was
cleverly
contrived
it
employed
the
epistle
of
polycarp
to
the
philippians
as
a
kind
of
voucher
for
its
authenticity
inasmuch
as
it
is
there
stated
that
ignatius
had
written
a
number
of
letters
and
it
contained
little
or
nothing
which
any
one
in
that
age
would
have
been
disposed
to
controvert
the
christians
of
rome
had
long
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
a
community
ennobled
by
the
blood
of
martyrs
and
they
would
be
quite
willing
to
believe
that
ignatius
had
contributed
to
their
celebrity
by
dying
for
the
faith
within
their
borders
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
he
really
finished
his
career
there
some
ancient
authorities
attest
that
he
suffered
at
antioch
and
the
fact
that
in
the
fourth
century
his
grave
was
pointed
out
in
that
locality
apparently
supports
their
testimony
the
account
of
his
hurried
removal
as
a
prisoner
from
antioch
to
rome
in
the
custody
of
ten
fierce
soldiers
whilst
he
was
permitted
as
he
passed
along
to
hold
something
like
a
levee
of
his
at
every
stage
of
his
journey
wears
very
much
the
appearance
of
an
fiction
but
the
disciples
at
rome
about
this
period
were
willing
to
be
credulous
in
such
matters
and
thus
it
was
that
this
tale
of
martyrdom
was
permitted
to
pass
unchallenged
in
due
time
the
author
of
the
letters
as
they
appeared
one
after
another
accomplished
the
design
of
their
composition
the
question
of
the
constitution
of
the
church
had
recently
awakened
much
attention
and
the
threat
of
victor
to
excommunicate
the
christians
of
asia
minor
because
they
ventured
to
differ
from
him
as
to
the
mode
of
celebrating
the
paschal
festival
had
no
doubt
led
to
discussions
relative
to
the
claims
of
episcopal
authority
which
at
rome
especially
were
felt
to
be
very
inconvenient
and
uncomfortable
no
one
could
well
maintain
that
it
had
a
scriptural
warrant
the
few
who
were
acquainted
with
its
history
were
aware
that
it
was
only
a
human
arrangement
of
comparatively
recent
introduction
and
yet
a
bishop
who
threatened
with
excommunication
such
as
refused
to
submit
to
his
mandates
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
make
such
a
confession
irenaeus
had
sanctioned
its
establishment
but
when
victor
became
so
overbearing
he
took
the
alarm
and
told
him
plainly
that
those
who
presided
over
the
church
of
rome
before
him
were
nothing
but
presbyters
this
was
rather
an
awkward
disclosure
and
it
was
felt
by
the
friends
of
the
new
order
that
some
voucher
was
required
to
help
it
in
its
hour
of
need
and
to
fortify
its
pretensions
the
letters
of
an
apostolic
father
strongly
asserting
its
claims
could
not
fail
to
give
it
encouragement
we
can
thus
understand
how
at
this
crisis
these
epistles
were
forthcoming
they
were
admirably
calculated
to
quiet
the
public
mind
they
were
comparatively
short
so
that
they
could
be
easily
read
and
they
were
quite
to
the
point
for
they
taught
that
we
are
to
regard
the
bishop
as
the
lord
himself
and
that
he
presides
after
the
likeness
of
god
who
after
all
this
could
doubt
the
claims
of
episcopacy
should
not
the
words
of
an
apostolic
father
put
an
end
to
all
farther
questionings
hippolytus
who
was
his
contemporary
has
given
us
much
information
in
relation
to
callistus
he
writes
indeed
in
an
unfriendly
spirit
but
he
speaks
notwithstanding
as
an
honest
man
and
we
can
not
well
reject
his
statements
as
destitute
of
foundation
his
account
of
the
general
facts
in
the
career
of
this
roman
bishop
obviously
rest
on
a
substratum
of
truth
as
we
read
these
ignatian
letters
it
may
occur
to
us
that
the
real
author
sometimes
betrays
his
identity
callistus
had
been
originally
a
slave
and
he
here
represents
ignatius
as
saying
of
himself
i
am
a
slave
callistus
had
been
a
convict
and
more
than
once
this
ignatius
declares
i
am
a
convict
may
he
not
thus
intend
to
remind
his
at
rome
that
an
illustrious
bishop
and
martyr
had
once
been
a
slave
and
a
convict
like
himself
callistus
when
labouring
in
the
mines
of
sardinia
must
have
been
well
acquainted
with
ropes
and
hoists
and
here
ignatius
describes
the
ephesians
as
hoisted
up
to
the
heights
through
the
engine
of
jesus
christ
having
faith
as
their
windlass
and
as
using
for
a
rope
the
holy
spirit
callistus
had
at
one
time
been
in
charge
of
a
bank
and
ignatius
in
one
of
these
epistles
is
made
to
say
let
your
works
be
your
that
you
may
receive
your
due
to
you
callistus
also
had
charge
of
the
christian
cemetery
in
the
roman
catacombs
and
ignatius
here
expresses
himself
as
one
familiar
with
graves
and
funerals
he
speaks
of
a
heretic
as
being
himself
a
bearer
of
a
corpse
and
of
those
inclined
to
judaism
as
tombstones
and
graves
of
the
dead
it
is
rather
singular
that
in
these
few
short
letters
we
find
so
many
expressions
which
point
to
callistus
as
the
writer
there
are
however
other
matters
which
warrant
equally
strong
suspicions
hippolytus
tells
us
that
callistus
was
a
patripassian
the
father
said
he
having
taken
human
nature
deified
it
by
uniting
it
to
himself
and
so
he
said
that
the
father
had
suffered
with
the
son
hence
ignatius
in
these
epistles
startles
us
by
such
expressions
as
the
blood
of
god
and
the
passion
of
my
god
callistus
is
accused
by
hippolytus
as
a
trimmer
prepared
as
occasion
served
to
conciliate
different
parties
in
the
church
by
appearing
to
adopt
their
views
sometimes
he
sided
with
hippolytus
and
sometimes
with
those
opposed
to
him
hence
it
is
that
the
theology
taught
in
these
letters
is
of
a
very
equivocal
character
lightfoot
has
seized
upon
this
fact
as
a
reason
that
they
are
never
quoted
by
irenaeus
the
language
approaching
dangerously
near
to
heresy
might
says
he
have
led
him
to
avoid
directly
quoting
the
doctrinal
teaching
a
much
better
reason
was
that
he
had
never
heard
of
these
letters
and
yet
their
theology
is
exactly
such
a
piebald
production
as
might
have
been
expected
from
callistus
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
how
lightfoot
has
brought
himself
to
believe
that
these
ignatian
epistles
were
written
in
the
beginning
of
the
second
century
the
whole
range
of
christian
says
he
no
more
uncompromising
advocacy
of
the
episcopate
can
be
found
than
appears
in
these
writings
it
is
when
asserting
the
claims
of
the
episcopal
office
to
obedience
and
respect
that
the
language
is
to
the
the
bishops
established
the
farthest
part
of
the
are
in
the
counsels
of
jesus
christ
it
is
simply
incredible
that
such
a
state
of
things
could
have
existed
six
or
seven
years
after
the
death
of
the
apostle
john
all
the
extant
writings
for
sixty
years
after
the
alleged
date
of
the
martyrdom
of
ignatius
demonstrate
the
utter
falsehood
of
these
letters
it
is
certain
that
they
employ
a
terminology
and
develop
church
principles
unknown
before
the
beginning
of
the
third
century
and
which
were
not
current
even
then
the
forger
whoever
he
may
have
been
has
displayed
no
little
art
and
address
in
their
fabrication
from
all
that
we
know
of
callistus
he
was
quite
equal
to
the
task
like
the
false
decretals
these
letters
exerted
much
influence
on
the
subsequent
history
of
the
church
cyprian
though
he
never
mentions
them
speedily
caught
their
spirit
his
assertion
of
episcopal
authority
is
quite
in
the
same
style
origen
visited
rome
shortly
after
they
appeared
he
is
the
first
writer
who
recognises
them
and
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
of
the
three
quotations
from
them
found
in
his
works
two
are
from
the
epistle
to
the
romans
it
is
quite
within
the
range
of
possibility
that
evidence
may
yet
be
forthcoming
to
prove
that
they
emanated
from
one
of
the
early
popes
they
are
worthy
of
such
an
origin
they
recommend
that
blind
and
slavish
submission
to
ecclesiastical
dictation
which
the
successors
of
peter
have
ever
since
inculcated
it
need
hardly
be
remarked
says
lightfoot
how
subversive
of
the
true
spirit
of
christianity
in
the
negation
of
individual
freedom
and
the
consequent
suppression
of
direct
responsibility
to
god
in
christ
is
the
with
which
the
language
of
these
letters
if
taken
literally
would
invest
the
episcopal
office
and
yet
having
devoted
nearly
thirty
years
off
and
on
to
the
study
of
these
epistles
the
bishop
of
durham
maintains
that
we
have
here
the
genuine
writings
of
an
apostolic
father
who
was
instructed
by
the
inspired
founders
of
the
christian
church
in
this
review
no
notice
is
taken
of
the
various
forms
of
these
epistles
if
they
are
all
forgeries
it
is
not
worth
while
to
spend
time
in
discussing
the
merits
of
the
several
editions
appendices
i
letter
of
the
late
cureton
immediately
after
the
appearance
of
the
second
edition
of
ancient
a
copy
of
it
was
sent
to
the
late
rev
cureton
canon
of
westminster
the
author
of
various
publications
relating
to
the
ignatian
epistles
it
was
considered
only
due
to
that
distinguished
scholar
to
call
his
attention
to
a
work
in
which
he
was
so
prominently
noticed
and
in
which
various
arguments
were
adduced
to
prove
that
all
the
letters
he
had
edited
are
utterly
spurious
in
a
short
time
that
gentleman
acknowledged
the
presentation
of
the
volume
in
a
most
kind
and
courteous
communication
which
will
be
read
with
special
interest
by
all
who
have
studied
the
ignatian
controversy
i
give
the
letter
entire
just
as
it
reached
me
it
was
published
several
years
ago
appended
to
my
catholic
deans
yard
westminster
dear
sir
i
beg
to
thank
you
very
much
for
your
kindness
in
sending
me
a
valuable
contribution
to
ecclesiastical
history
in
your
book
ancient
which
i
found
here
upon
my
return
to
london
two
or
three
days
ago
how
much
would
it
contribute
to
the
promotion
of
charity
and
the
advancement
of
the
truth
were
all
who
combated
the
opinions
and
views
of
another
to
give
him
the
means
of
seeing
what
was
written
fairly
and
openly
and
not
to
endeavour
to
overthrow
his
arguments
without
his
knowledge
this
will
indeed
ever
be
the
case
when
truth
is
sought
for
itself
and
no
personal
feelings
enter
into
the
matter
i
have
read
your
chapters
on
ignatius
and
you
will
perhaps
hardly
expect
that
i
should
subscribe
to
your
views
it
is
now
about
twenty
years
since
i
first
undertook
this
inquiry
and
constantly
have
i
been
endeavouring
to
add
some
new
light
ever
since
i
once
answered
an
opponent
in
my
present
brother
canon
wordsworth
but
since
that
time
i
have
never
replied
to
any
adverse
views
but
have
only
looked
to
see
if
i
could
find
anything
either
to
show
that
i
was
wrong
or
to
strengthen
my
convictions
that
i
was
right
and
i
have
found
the
wisdom
of
this
and
have
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
my
ablest
opponents
after
having
had
more
time
to
inquire
and
to
make
greater
research
have
of
their
own
accord
conformed
to
my
views
and
written
in
their
support
i
attach
no
very
great
importance
to
the
epistles
of
ignatius
i
shall
not
draw
from
them
any
dogma
i
only
look
upon
them
as
evidence
of
the
time
to
certain
facts
which
indeed
were
amply
established
even
without
such
evidence
i
think
that
in
such
cases
we
must
look
chiefly
to
the
historical
testimony
of
facts
and
you
will
forgive
me
for
saying
that
i
think
your
arguments
are
based
upon
presumptive
evidence
negative
evidence
and
the
evidence
of
appropriateness
all
of
which
however
valuable
must
tumble
to
the
ground
before
one
single
fact
you
notice
that
archbishop
ussher
doubted
the
epistle
to
polycarp
but
why
simply
because
its
style
not
having
been
altered
by
the
forger
was
different
from
the
rest
but
you
know
he
says
there
was
more
evidence
in
its
favour
than
for
any
of
the
rest
it
thus
becomes
an
argument
in
support
of
the
syriac
text
instead
of
against
it
can
you
explain
how
it
happens
that
the
syriac
text
found
in
the
very
language
of
ignatius
himself
and
transcribed
many
hundreds
of
years
before
the
ignatian
controversy
was
thought
of
now
it
is
discovered
should
contain
only
the
of
the
existence
of
which
there
is
any
historical
evidence
before
the
time
of
eusebius
and
that
although
it
may
contain
some
things
which
you
do
not
approve
still
has
rejected
all
the
passages
which
the
critics
of
the
ignatian
controversy
protested
against
you
go
too
far
to
say
that
bentley
rejected
the
ignatian
epistles
he
only
rejected
them
in
the
form
in
which
they
were
put
forth
by
ussher
and
vossius
and
not
in
the
form
of
the
syriac
so
did
porson
as
bishop
kaye
informed
me
but
he
never
denied
that
ignatius
had
written
letters
indeed
the
very
forgeries
were
a
proof
of
true
patterns
which
were
falsified
a
great
many
of
the
ablest
scholars
in
europe
who
had
refused
to
accept
the
greek
letters
are
convinced
of
the
genuineness
of
the
syriac
but
time
will
open
believe
me
yours
faithfully
william
cureton
the
rev
killen
some
time
after
this
letter
was
written
ecclesiastical
literature
sustained
a
severe
loss
in
the
death
of
its
amiable
and
accomplished
author
though
cureton
here
expressed
himself
with
due
caution
his
language
is
certainly
not
calculated
to
reassure
the
advocates
of
the
ignatian
epistles
one
of
their
most
learned
editors
in
recent
times
so
far
from
speaking
in
a
tone
of
confidence
respecting
them
here
admits
that
he
attached
to
them
no
very
great
importance
though
he
had
spent
twenty
years
chiefly
in
their
illustration
he
acknowledges
that
he
was
constantly
endeavouring
to
add
some
new
light
for
his
guidance
to
him
therefore
the
subject
must
have
been
still
involved
in
much
mystery
it
is
noteworthy
that
in
the
preceding
letter
he
has
not
been
able
to
point
out
a
solitary
error
in
the
statement
of
the
claims
of
these
epistles
as
presented
in
ancient
he
alleges
indeed
that
the
arguments
employed
are
based
upon
presumptive
evidence
negative
evidence
and
the
evidence
of
appropriateness
he
confesses
that
these
proofs
are
valuable
but
though
he
contends
that
they
must
all
tumble
to
the
around
before
one
single
fact
he
has
failed
to
produce
the
one
single
fact
required
for
their
overthrow
cureton
had
obviously
not
been
previously
aware
that
bentley
the
highest
authority
among
british
critics
had
rejected
the
ignatian
epistles
had
he
been
cognisant
of
that
fact
when
he
wrote
the
he
would
have
candidly
announced
it
to
his
readers
the
manner
in
which
he
here
attempts
to
dispose
of
it
is
certainly
not
very
satisfactory
he
pleads
that
though
bentley
condemned
as
spurious
the
letters
edited
by
ussher
and
vossius
he
would
not
have
pronounced
the
same
decision
on
the
syriac
version
recently
discovered
why
not
this
syriac
version
is
an
edition
of
same
in
an
abbreviated
form
if
bentley
denounced
as
a
forgery
it
seems
to
follow
by
logical
inference
that
he
would
have
pronounced
the
same
verdict
on
the
half
or
the
third
part
cureton
is
mistaken
when
he
affirms
in
the
preceding
communication
that
his
syriac
version
has
rejected
all
the
passages
against
which
the
critics
of
the
ignatian
controversy
had
protested
the
very
contrary
has
been
demonstrated
in
ancient
a
large
number
of
the
sentences
which
had
provoked
the
most
unsparing
criticism
are
retained
in
the
curetonian
edition
it
is
right
to
add
that
archbishop
ussher
more
than
doubted
the
epistle
to
polycarp
he
discarded
it
altogether
without
hesitation
he
set
it
aside
as
spurious
whilst
he
disliked
its
style
he
felt
that
it
wanted
other
marks
of
genuineness
when
writing
ancient
now
nearly
thirty
years
ago
i
was
disposed
to
think
that
the
ignatian
epistles
had
been
manufactured
at
antioch
but
more
mature
consideration
has
led
me
to
adopt
the
conclusion
that
they
were
concocted
at
rome
they
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
several
other
spurious
works
which
appeared
there
and
the
servile
submission
to
episcopal
authority
which
they
so
strenuously
inculcate
was
first
most
offensively
challenged
by
the
chief
pastor
of
the
great
western
bishopric
these
epistles
tended
much
to
promote
the
progress
of
ecclesiastical
despotism
any
one
who
studies
the
two
chapters
on
the
ignatian
epistles
in
ancient
must
see
that
what
is
there
urged
against
them
is
something
more
than
presumptive
evidence
negative
evidence
and
the
evidence
of
appropriateness
it
is
shown
that
their
anachronisms
historical
blundering
and
false
doctrine
clearly
convict
them
of
forgery
ii
it
has
been
deemed
right
to
subjoin
here
a
copy
of
the
ignatian
epistle
to
the
romans
as
some
readers
may
not
have
it
at
hand
for
consultation
various
translations
of
this
epistle
have
been
published
the
following
adheres
pretty
closely
to
that
given
by
the
bishop
of
durham
ignatius
who
is
also
theophorus
to
her
that
has
obtained
mercy
through
the
might
of
the
most
high
father
and
of
jesus
christ
his
only
son
to
the
church
which
is
beloved
and
enlightened
through
the
will
of
him
who
willeth
all
things
that
are
according
to
the
love
of
jesus
christ
our
god
to
her
that
has
the
presidency
in
the
country
of
the
region
of
the
romans
being
worthy
of
god
worthy
of
honour
worthy
of
felicitation
worthy
of
praise
worthy
of
success
worthy
in
purity
and
having
the
presidency
of
love
walking
in
the
law
of
christ
and
bearing
the
father
name
which
i
also
salute
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
the
son
of
the
father
to
those
that
are
united
both
according
to
the
flesh
and
spirit
to
every
one
of
his
commandments
being
filled
inseparably
with
the
grace
of
god
and
filtered
clear
from
every
foreign
stain
abundance
of
happiness
unblameably
in
jesus
christ
our
god
through
prayer
to
god
i
have
obtained
the
privilege
of
seeing
your
most
worthy
faces
and
have
even
been
granted
more
than
i
requested
for
i
hope
as
a
prisoner
in
jesus
christ
to
salute
you
if
indeed
it
be
the
will
of
god
that
i
be
thought
worthy
of
attaining
unto
the
end
for
the
beginning
has
been
well
ordered
if
so
be
i
shall
attain
unto
the
goal
that
i
may
receive
my
inheritance
without
hindrance
for
i
am
afraid
of
your
love
lest
it
should
be
to
me
an
injury
for
it
is
easy
for
you
to
accomplish
what
you
please
but
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
attain
to
god
if
ye
spare
me
for
i
would
not
have
you
to
be
but
to
please
god
as
ye
do
please
him
for
neither
shall
i
ever
have
such
an
opportunity
of
attaining
to
god
nor
can
ye
if
ye
be
silent
ever
be
entitled
to
the
honour
of
a
better
work
for
if
ye
are
silent
concerning
me
i
shall
become
god
but
if
ye
love
my
body
i
shall
have
my
course
again
to
run
pray
then
do
not
seek
to
confer
any
greater
favour
upon
me
than
that
i
be
poured
out
a
libation
to
god
while
there
is
still
an
altar
ready
that
being
gathered
together
in
love
ye
may
sing
praise
to
the
father
through
jesus
christ
that
god
has
deemed
me
the
bishop
of
syria
worthy
to
be
sent
for
from
the
east
to
the
west
it
is
good
to
set
from
the
world
to
god
that
i
may
rise
again
to
him
ye
have
never
envied
any
one
ye
have
taught
others
and
my
desire
is
that
those
lessons
shall
hold
good
which
as
teachers
ye
enjoin
only
request
in
my
behalf
both
inward
and
outward
strength
so
that
i
may
not
only
say
it
but
also
desire
it
that
i
may
not
only
be
called
a
christian
but
really
be
found
one
for
if
i
shall
be
found
so
then
can
i
also
be
called
one
and
be
faithful
then
when
i
shall
no
longer
appear
to
the
world
nothing
visible
is
good
for
our
god
jesus
christ
now
that
he
is
with
the
father
is
all
the
more
revealed
the
work
is
not
of
persuasiveness
but
of
greatness
whensoever
it
is
hated
by
the
world
i
write
to
all
the
churches
and
i
bid
all
men
know
that
of
my
own
free
will
i
die
for
god
unless
ye
should
hinder
me
i
exhort
you
not
to
show
an
unseasonable
towards
me
suffer
me
to
become
food
for
the
wild
beasts
that
through
them
i
shall
attain
to
god
i
am
the
wheat
of
god
and
i
am
ground
by
the
teeth
of
wild
beasts
that
i
may
be
found
the
pure
bread
of
christ
rather
entice
the
wild
beasts
that
they
may
become
my
sepulchre
and
may
leave
no
part
of
my
body
behind
so
that
i
may
not
when
i
am
fallen
asleep
be
burdensome
to
any
one
then
shall
i
be
truly
a
disciple
of
jesus
christ
when
the
world
shall
not
so
much
as
see
my
body
supplicate
the
lord
for
me
that
through
these
instruments
i
may
be
found
a
sacrifice
to
god
i
do
not
enjoin
you
as
peter
and
paul
did
they
were
apostles
i
am
a
convict
they
were
free
i
am
a
slave
to
this
very
hour
but
when
i
suffer
i
shall
be
a
of
jesus
christ
and
shall
rise
free
in
him
now
i
am
learning
in
my
bonds
to
put
away
every
desire
from
syria
even
to
rome
i
fight
with
wild
beasts
by
land
and
sea
by
night
and
by
day
being
bound
amidst
ten
leopards
even
a
company
of
soldiers
who
only
become
worse
when
they
are
kindly
treated
howbeit
through
their
i
am
become
more
completely
a
disciple
yet
am
i
not
hereby
justified
may
i
have
joy
of
the
beasts
that
have
been
prepared
for
me
and
i
pray
that
i
may
find
them
prompt
nay
i
will
entice
them
that
they
may
devour
me
promptly
not
as
they
have
done
to
some
refusing
to
touch
them
through
fear
yea
though
of
themselves
they
should
not
be
willing
while
i
am
ready
i
myself
will
force
them
to
it
bear
with
me
i
know
what
is
expedient
for
me
now
am
i
beginning
to
be
a
disciple
may
nought
of
things
visible
and
things
invisible
envy
me
that
i
may
attain
unto
jesus
christ
come
fire
and
cross
and
grapplings
with
wild
beasts
cuttings
and
manglings
wrenching
of
bones
hacking
of
limbs
crushings
of
my
whole
body
come
cruel
tortures
of
the
devil
to
assail
me
only
be
it
mine
to
attain
to
jesus
christ
the
farthest
bounds
of
the
universe
shall
profit
me
nothing
neither
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
it
is
good
for
me
to
die
for
jesus
christ
rather
than
to
reign
over
the
farthest
bounds
of
the
earth
i
seek
him
who
died
on
our
behalf
i
desire
him
who
rose
again
for
our
sake
my
are
at
hand
pardon
me
brethren
do
not
hinder
me
from
living
do
not
wish
to
keep
me
in
a
state
of
death
while
i
desire
to
belong
to
god
do
not
give
me
over
to
the
world
neither
allure
me
with
material
things
suffer
me
to
obtain
pure
light
when
i
have
gone
thither
then
shall
i
be
a
man
permit
me
to
be
an
imitator
of
the
passion
of
my
god
if
any
man
has
him
within
himself
let
him
consider
what
i
desire
and
let
him
have
sympathy
with
me
as
knowing
how
i
am
straitened
the
prince
of
this
world
would
fain
seize
me
and
corrupt
my
disposition
towards
god
let
not
any
of
you
therefore
that
are
near
abet
him
rather
be
ye
on
my
side
that
is
on
god
side
do
not
speak
of
jesus
christ
and
set
your
desires
on
the
world
let
not
envy
dwell
among
you
even
though
i
myself
when
i
am
with
you
should
beseech
you
obey
me
not
but
rather
give
credit
to
those
things
which
i
now
write
my
earthly
passion
has
been
crucified
and
there
is
no
fire
of
material
longing
in
me
but
there
is
within
me
a
water
that
lives
and
speaks
saying
to
me
inwardly
to
the
father
i
have
no
delight
in
the
food
of
corruption
or
in
the
delights
of
this
life
i
desire
the
bread
of
god
which
is
the
flesh
of
christ
who
was
of
the
seed
of
david
and
for
a
draught
i
desire
his
blood
which
is
love
incorruptible
i
desire
no
longer
to
live
after
the
manner
of
men
and
this
shall
be
if
ye
desire
it
be
ye
willing
then
that
ye
also
may
be
desired
in
a
brief
letter
i
beseech
you
do
ye
give
credit
to
me
jesus
christ
will
reveal
these
things
to
you
so
that
ye
shall
know
that
i
speak
the
truth
jesus
christ
the
unerring
mouth
by
which
the
father
has
spoken
truly
pray
for
me
that
i
may
attain
the
object
of
my
desire
i
write
not
unto
you
after
the
flesh
but
after
the
mind
of
god
if
i
shall
suffer
it
was
your
desire
but
if
i
am
rejected
ye
have
hated
me
remember
in
your
prayers
the
church
which
is
in
syria
which
has
god
for
its
shepherd
in
my
stead
jesus
christ
alone
shall
be
its
bishop
he
and
your
love
but
for
myself
i
am
ashamed
to
be
called
one
of
them
for
neither
am
i
worthy
being
the
very
last
of
them
and
an
untimely
birth
but
i
have
found
mercy
that
i
should
be
some
one
if
so
i
shall
attain
unto
god
my
spirit
salutes
you
and
the
love
of
the
churches
which
received
me
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
not
as
a
mere
wayfarer
for
even
those
churches
which
did
not
lie
on
my
route
after
the
flesh
went
before
me
from
city
to
city
now
i
write
these
things
to
you
from
smyrna
by
the
hand
of
the
ephesians
who
are
worthy
of
all
felicitation
and
crocus
also
a
name
very
dear
to
me
is
with
me
with
many
others
besides
as
touching
those
who
went
before
me
from
syria
to
rome
to
the
glory
of
god
i
believe
that
ye
have
received
instructions
whom
also
apprize
that
i
am
near
for
they
all
are
worthy
of
god
and
of
you
and
it
becomes
you
to
refresh
them
in
all
things
these
things
i
write
to
you
on
the
before
the
kalends
of
september
unto
the
end
in
the
patient
waiting
for
jesus
christ
this
letter
is
a
strange
mixture
of
silly
babblement
mysticism
and
fanaticism
but
throughout
it
wants
the
true
ring
of
an
honest
correspondence
why
does
the
writer
describe
himself
as
the
of
and
why
does
he
never
once
mention
from
beginning
to
end
when
an
apostle
was
imprisoned
his
brethren
prayed
for
his
release
acts
xii
but
this
ignatius
forbade
the
christians
at
rome
to
make
any
attempt
to
save
him
from
martyrdom
paul
taught
that
he
might
give
his
body
to
be
burned
and
yet
after
all
be
a
reprobate
cor
xiii
but
this
ignatius
indicates
that
all
would
be
well
with
him
if
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
eaten
by
the
lions
his
letter
is
pervaded
not
by
the
enlightened
and
cheerful
piety
of
the
new
testament
but
by
the
gloomy
and
repulsive
spirit
of
montanism
bishop
lightfoot
tells
us
that
it
had
a
wider
popularity
than
the
other
letters
of
ignatius
vol
ii
it
was
accommodated
to
the
taste
of
an
age
of
deteriorated
christianity
polycarp
would
have
sternly
condemned
its
extravagance
but
in
the
early
part
of
the
third
century
the
tone
of
public
sentiment
in
the
christian
church
was
greatly
changed
and
the
writings
of
tertullian
contributed
much
to
give
encouragement
to
such
productions
as
the
ignatian
epistles
tertullian
however
in
his
numerous
writings
never
once
names
ignatius
it
would
appear
that
he
had
never
heard

paul

admits
that
it

he
vainly
tries
to
prove
that
the
words
qui
cum

must
be
a
mistranslation

do
not
suit

imply
that
ignatius

were
still
living

lightfoot
has
endeavoured

derive
support

his
argument
is
however
quite
inconclusive
the
dignity

asiarch
could
be
enjoyed

rich

says
if

then
we
must
allow
that
external

exceedingly
weak

hence
is
highly
favourable
to
the
suspicion
