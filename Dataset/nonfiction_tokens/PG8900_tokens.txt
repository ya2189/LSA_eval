for

the
preface
the
many
inhabitants
of
cities
and
towns
as
well
as
travellers
that
have
for
a
long
time
suffered
great
prejudices
from
unwholsome
and
unpleasant
beers
and
ales
by
the
badness
of
malts
underboiling
the
worts
mixing
injurious
ingredients
the
unskilfulness
of
the
brewer
and
the
great
expense
that
families
have
been
at
in
buying
them
clogg
with
a
heavy
excise
has
moved
me
to
undertake
the
writing
of
this
treatise
on
brewing
wherein
i
have
endeavour
to
set
in
sight
the
many
advantages
of
body
and
purse
that
may
arise
from
a
due
knowledge
and
management
in
brewing
malt
liquors
which
are
of
the
greatest
importance
as
they
are
in
a
considerable
degree
our
nourishment
and
the
common
diluters
of
our
food
so
that
on
their
goodness
depends
very
much
the
health
and
longevity
of
the
body
this
bad
economy
in
brewing
has
brought
on
such
a
disrepute
and
made
our
malt
liquors
in
general
so
odious
that
many
have
been
constrain
either
to
be
at
an
expence
for
better
drinks
than
their
pockets
could
afford
or
take
up
with
a
toast
and
water
to
avoid
the
too
justly
apprehended
ill
consequences
of
drinking
such
ales
and
beers
wherefore
i
have
given
an
account
of
brewing
beers
and
ales
after
several
methods
and
also
several
curious
receipts
for
feeding
fining
and
preserving
malt
liquors
that
are
most
of
them
wholsomer
than
the
malt
itself
and
so
cheap
that
none
can
object
against
the
charge
which
i
thought
was
the
ready
way
to
supplant
the
use
of
those
unwholsome
ingredients
that
have
been
made
too
free
with
by
some
ill
principled
people
meerly
for
their
own
profit
tho
at
the
expence
of
the
health
hope
i
have
adjusted
that
long
wanted
method
of
giving
a
due
standard
both
to
the
hop
and
wort
which
never
was
yet
as
i
know
of
rightly
ascertain
in
print
before
tho
the
want
of
it
i
am
perswaded
has
been
partly
the
occasion
of
the
scarcity
of
good
drinks
as
is
at
this
time
very
evident
in
most
places
in
the
nation
i
have
here
also
divulg
the
nostrum
of
the
artist
brewer
that
he
has
so
long
valued
himself
upon
in
making
a
right
judgment
when
the
worts
are
boiled
to
a
true
crisis
a
matter
of
considerable
consequence
because
all
strong
worts
may
be
boiled
too
much
or
too
little
to
the
great
loss
of
the
owner
and
without
this
knowledge
a
brewer
must
go
on
by
guess
which
is
a
hazard
that
every
one
ought
to
be
free
from
that
can
and
therefore
i
have
endeavor
to
explode
the
old
way
of
brewing
by
reason
of
the
several
uncertainties
that
attend
such
methods
and
the
hazard
of
spoiling
both
malt
and
drink
for
in
short
where
a
brewing
is
perform
by
ladings
over
of
scalding
water
there
is
no
occasion
for
the
watch
or
to
boil
the
wort
by
which
is
best
known
by
the
eye
as
i
have
both
in
this
and
my
second
book
made
appear
i
have
here
observed
that
necessary
caution
which
is
perfectly
requisite
in
the
choice
of
good
and
the
management
of
bad
waters
a
matter
of
high
importance
as
the
use
of
this
vehicle
is
unavoidable
in
brewing
and
therefore
requires
a
strict
inspection
into
its
nature
and
this
i
have
been
the
more
particular
in
because
i
am
sensible
of
the
great
quantities
of
unwholsome
waters
used
not
only
by
necessity
but
by
a
mistaken
choice
so
also
i
have
confuted
the
old
received
opinion
lately
published
by
an
eminent
hand
that
long
mashings
are
the
best
methods
in
brewing
an
error
of
dangerous
consequence
to
all
those
who
brew
by
ladings
over
of
the
hot
water
on
the
malt
the
great
difficulty
and
what
has
hitherto
proved
an
impediment
and
discouragement
to
many
from
brewing
their
own
drinks
i
think
i
have
in
some
measure
removed
and
made
it
plainly
appear
how
a
quantity
of
malt
liquor
may
be
brewed
in
a
little
room
and
in
the
hottest
weather
without
the
least
damage
by
foxing
or
other
taint
the
benefit
of
brewing
entire
guile
small
beer
from
fresh
malt
and
the
ill
effects
of
that
made
from
goods
after
strong
beer
or
ale
i
have
here
exposed
for
the
sake
of
the
health
and
pleasure
of
those
that
may
easily
prove
their
advantage
by
drinking
of
the
former
and
refusing
the
latter
by
the
time
the
following
treatise
is
read
over
and
thoroughly
considered
i
doubt
not
but
an
ordinary
capacity
will
be
in
some
degree
a
better
judge
of
good
and
bad
malt
liquors
as
a
drinker
and
have
such
a
knowledge
in
brewing
that
formerly
he
was
a
stranger
to
and
therefore
i
am
in
great
hopes
these
my
efforts
will
be
one
principal
cause
of
the
reforming
our
malt
liquors
in
most
places
and
that
more
private
families
than
ever
will
come
into
the
delightful
and
profitable
practice
of
brewing
their
own
drinks
and
thereby
not
only
save
almost
half
in
half
of
expence
but
enjoy
such
as
has
passed
thro
its
regular
digestions
and
is
truly
pleasant
fine
strong
and
healthful
i
question
not
but
this
book
will
meet
with
some
scepticks
who
being
neither
prejudiced
against
the
introduction
of
new
improvements
or
that
their
interests
will
be
hereby
eclipsed
in
time
to
such
i
say
i
do
not
write
because
i
have
little
hopes
to
reform
a
wrong
practice
in
them
by
reason
and
argument
but
those
who
are
above
prejudice
may
easily
judge
of
the
great
benefits
that
will
accrue
by
the
following
methods
i
have
here
plainly
made
known
and
of
those
in
my
second
book
that
i
have
almost
finished
and
hope
to
publish
in
a
little
time
wherein
i
shall
set
forth
how
to
brew
without
boiling
water
or
wort
and
several
other
ways
that
will
be
of
considerable
service
to
the
illustration
chap
i
the
nature
of
the
and
of
the
proper
soils
and
manures
for
the
improvement
this
grain
is
well
known
to
excel
all
others
for
making
of
malts
that
produce
those
fine
liquors
beer
and
ale
which
no
other
nation
can
equalize
but
as
this
excellency
can
not
be
obtain
unless
the
several
ingredients
are
in
a
perfect
state
and
order
and
these
also
attended
with
a
right
judgment
i
shall
here
endeavour
to
treat
on
their
several
particulars
and
first
of
soils
this
grain
i
annually
sow
in
my
fields
on
diversities
of
soils
and
thereby
have
brought
to
my
knowledge
several
differences
arising
therefrom
on
our
red
clays
this
grain
generally
comes
off
reddish
at
both
ends
and
sometimes
all
over
with
a
thick
skin
and
tuff
nature
somewhat
like
the
soil
it
grows
in
and
therefore
not
so
valuable
as
that
of
contrary
qualities
nor
are
the
black
blewish
marly
clays
of
the
vale
much
better
but
loams
are
and
gravels
better
than
them
as
all
the
chalks
are
better
then
gravels
on
these
two
last
soils
the
barley
acquires
a
whitish
body
a
thin
skin
a
short
plump
kernel
and
a
unreadable
flower
which
occasions
those
fine
pale
and
amber
malts
made
at
and
from
the
barley
that
comes
off
the
white
and
gravelly
grounds
about
those
places
for
it
is
certain
there
is
as
much
difference
in
barley
as
in
wheat
or
other
grain
from
the
sort
it
comes
off
as
appears
by
the
excellent
wheats
that
grow
in
the
marly
vale
earths
peas
in
sands
and
barley
in
gravels
and
chalks
for
our
mother
earth
as
it
is
destinated
to
the
service
of
man
in
the
production
of
vegetables
is
composed
of
various
sorts
of
soils
for
different
seeds
to
grow
therein
and
since
providence
has
been
pleased
to
allow
man
this
great
privilege
for
the
imployment
of
his
skill
and
labour
to
improve
the
same
to
his
advantage
it
certainly
behoves
us
to
acquaint
ourselves
with
its
several
natures
and
how
to
adapt
an
agreeable
grain
and
manure
to
their
natural
soil
as
being
the
very
foundation
of
enjoying
good
and
bad
malts
this
is
obvious
by
parallel
deductions
from
turneps
sown
on
rank
clayey
loamy
grounds
dressed
with
noxious
dungs
that
render
them
bitter
tuff
and
nauseous
while
those
that
grow
on
gravels
sands
and
chalky
loams
under
the
assistance
of
the
fold
or
soot
lime
ashes
hornshavings
are
sweet
unreadable
and
pleasant
is
the
same
also
with
salads
asparagus
cabbages
and
all
other
culinary
ware
that
come
off
those
rich
grounds
glutted
with
the
great
quantities
of
and
other
rank
dungs
which
are
not
near
so
pure
sweet
and
wholsome
as
those
produced
from
virgin
mould
and
other
healthy
earths
and
manures
there
is
likewise
another
reason
that
has
brought
a
disreputation
on
some
of
the
and
that
is
the
too
often
sowing
of
one
and
the
same
piece
of
ground
whereby
its
spirituous
nitrous
and
sulphureous
qualities
are
exhausted
and
worn
out
by
the
constant
attraction
of
its
best
juices
for
the
nutriment
of
the
grain
to
supply
which
great
quantities
of
dungs
are
often
incorporated
with
such
earths
whereby
they
become
impregnated
with
four
adulterated
unwholsome
qualities
that
so
affect
the
barley
that
grows
therein
as
to
render
it
incapable
of
making
such
pure
and
sweet
malts
as
that
which
is
sown
in
the
open
whose
earths
are
constantly
rested
every
third
year
called
the
in
order
to
discharge
their
crude
phlegmatick
and
sour
property
by
the
several
turnings
that
the
plough
gives
them
part
of
a
winter
and
one
whole
summer
which
exposes
the
rough
clotty
loose
parts
of
the
ground
and
by
degrees
brings
them
into
a
condition
of
making
a
lodgment
of
those
saline
benefits
that
arise
from
the
earths
and
afterwards
fall
down
and
redound
so
much
to
the
benefit
of
all
vegetables
that
grow
therein
as
being
the
essence
and
spring
of
life
to
all
things
that
have
root
and
tho
they
are
first
exhaled
by
the
sun
in
vapour
from
the
earth
as
the
spirit
or
breath
thereof
yet
is
it
return
again
in
snows
hails
dews
etc
more
than
in
rains
by
which
the
surface
of
the
globe
is
saturated
from
whence
it
reascends
in
the
juices
of
vegetables
and
enters
into
all
those
productions
as
food
and
nourishment
which
the
creation
supplies
here
then
may
appear
the
excellency
of
steeping
in
a
liquor
lately
invented
that
impregnates
and
loads
it
with
nitre
and
other
salts
that
are
the
nearest
of
all
others
to
the
true
and
original
spirit
or
salt
of
the
earth
and
therefore
in
a
great
measure
supplies
the
want
thereof
both
in
inclosure
and
open
field
for
even
in
this
last
it
is
sometimes
very
scarce
and
in
but
small
quantities
especially
after
a
hot
dry
summer
and
mild
winter
when
little
or
no
snows
have
fell
to
cover
the
earth
and
keep
this
spirit
in
by
which
and
great
frosts
it
is
often
much
encreased
and
then
shews
itself
in
the
warmth
of
well
waters
that
are
often
seen
to
wreak
in
the
cold
seasons
now
since
all
vegetables
more
or
less
partake
of
those
qualities
that
the
soil
and
manures
abound
with
in
which
they
grow
i
therefore
infer
that
all
barley
so
imbibed
improves
its
productions
by
the
ascension
of
those
saline
spirituous
particles
that
are
thus
lodged
in
the
seed
when
put
into
the
ground
and
are
part
of
the
nourishment
the
enjoys
and
for
this
reason
i
doubt
not
but
when
time
has
got
the
ascendant
of
prejudice
the
whole
nation
will
come
into
the
practice
of
the
invaluable
receipt
published
in
two
books
entituled
and
vale
farming
and
practical
both
writ
by
of
near
in
not
only
for
barley
but
other
grains
but
notwithstanding
barley
may
grow
on
a
light
soil
with
a
proper
manure
and
improved
by
the
liquor
of
this
receipt
yet
this
grain
may
be
damaged
or
spoiled
by
being
mown
too
soon
which
may
afterwards
be
discovered
by
its
shrivelled
and
lean
body
that
never
will
make
right
good
malt
or
if
it
is
mown
at
a
proper
time
and
if
it
be
housed
damp
or
wettish
it
will
be
apt
to
heat
and
and
then
it
will
never
make
so
good
malt
because
it
will
not
spire
nor
come
so
regularly
on
the
floor
as
that
which
was
inned
dry
again
i
have
known
one
part
of
a
almost
green
at
harvest
another
part
ripe
and
another
part
between
both
tho
it
was
all
sown
at
once
occasion
by
the
several
situations
of
the
seed
in
the
ground
and
the
succeeding
droughts
the
deepest
came
up
strong
and
was
ripe
soonest
the
next
succeeded
but
the
uppermost
for
want
of
rain
and
cover
some
of
it
grew
not
at
all
and
the
rest
was
green
at
harvest
now
these
irregularities
are
greatly
prevented
and
cured
by
the
application
of
the
ingredients
mentioned
in
the
receipt
which
infuses
such
a
moisture
into
the
body
of
the
seed
as
with
the
help
of
a
little
rain
and
the
many
dews
makes
it
spire
take
root
and
grow
when
others
are
ruined
for
want
of
the
assistance
of
such
steeping
barley
like
other
grain
will
also
degenerate
and
become
rank
lean
and
small
bodied
if
the
same
seed
is
sown
too
often
in
the
soil
is
therefore
that
the
best
farmers
not
only
change
the
seed
every
time
but
take
due
care
to
have
it
off
a
contrary
soil
that
they
sow
it
in
to
this
makes
several
in
my
neighbourhood
every
year
buy
their
in
the
vale
of
that
grew
there
on
the
black
clayey
marly
loams
to
sow
in
chalks
gravels
others
every
second
year
will
go
from
hence
to
and
buy
the
forward
or
barley
that
grows
there
on
both
which
methods
are
great
improvements
of
this
corn
and
whether
it
be
for
sowing
or
malting
the
plump
weighty
and
white
is
in
all
respects
much
kinder
than
the
lean
flinty
sorts
chap
ii
malts
as
i
have
described
the
ground
that
returns
the
best
barley
i
now
come
to
treat
of
making
it
into
malt
to
do
which
the
barley
is
put
into
a
leaden
or
tyled
cistern
that
holds
five
ten
or
more
quarters
that
is
covered
with
water
four
or
six
inches
above
the
barley
to
allow
for
its
swell
here
it
lyes
five
or
six
tides
as
the
malster
calls
it
reckoning
twelve
hours
to
the
tide
according
as
the
barley
is
in
body
or
in
dryness
for
that
which
comes
off
clays
or
has
been
wash
and
damag
by
rains
requires
less
time
than
the
dryer
grain
that
was
inned
well
and
grew
on
gravels
or
chalks
the
smooth
plump
corn
imbibing
the
water
more
kindly
when
the
lean
and
steely
barley
will
not
so
naturally
but
to
know
when
it
is
enough
is
to
take
a
corn
between
the
fingers
and
gently
crush
it
and
if
it
is
in
all
parts
mellow
and
the
husk
opens
or
starts
a
little
from
the
body
of
the
corn
then
it
is
enough
the
nicety
of
this
is
a
material
point
for
if
it
is
infus
too
much
the
sweetness
of
the
malt
will
be
greatly
taken
off
and
yield
the
less
spirit
and
so
will
cause
deadness
and
sourness
in
ale
or
beer
in
a
short
time
for
the
goodness
of
the
malt
contributes
much
to
the
preservation
of
all
ales
and
beers
then
the
water
must
be
drain
from
it
very
well
and
it
will
come
equal
and
better
on
the
floor
which
may
be
done
in
twelve
or
sixteen
hours
in
temperate
weather
but
in
cold
near
thirty
from
the
cistern
it
is
put
into
a
square
hutch
or
couch
where
it
must
lye
thirty
hours
for
the
officer
to
take
his
gage
who
allows
four
bushels
in
the
score
for
the
swell
in
this
or
the
cistern
then
it
must
be
work
night
and
day
in
one
or
two
heaps
as
the
weather
is
cold
or
hot
and
turn
every
four
six
or
eight
hours
the
outward
part
inwards
and
the
bottom
upwards
always
keeping
a
clear
floor
that
the
corn
that
lies
next
to
it
be
not
chill
and
as
soon
as
it
begins
to
come
or
spire
then
turn
it
every
three
four
or
five
hours
as
was
done
before
according
to
the
temper
of
the
air
which
greatly
governs
this
management
and
as
it
comes
or
works
more
so
must
the
heap
be
spreaded
and
thinned
larger
to
cool
it
thus
it
may
lye
and
be
work
on
the
floor
in
several
parallels
two
or
three
foot
thick
ten
or
more
foot
broad
and
fourteen
or
more
in
length
to
chip
and
spire
but
not
too
much
nor
too
soft
and
when
it
is
come
enough
it
is
to
be
turned
twelve
or
sixteen
times
in
hours
if
the
season
is
warm
as
in
or
and
when
it
is
fixed
and
the
root
begins
to
be
dead
then
it
must
be
thickned
again
and
carefully
kept
often
turned
and
work
that
the
growing
of
the
root
may
not
revive
and
this
is
better
done
with
the
shoes
off
than
on
and
here
the
workman
art
and
diligence
in
particular
is
tryed
in
keeping
the
floor
clear
and
turning
the
malt
often
that
it
neither
moulds
nor
that
is
that
the
blade
does
not
grow
out
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
root
for
if
it
does
the
flower
and
strength
of
the
malt
is
gone
and
nothing
left
behind
but
the
husk
and
tail
now
when
it
is
at
this
degree
and
fit
for
the
kiln
it
is
often
practised
to
put
it
into
a
heap
and
let
it
lye
twelve
hours
before
it
is
turned
to
heat
and
mellow
which
will
much
improve
the
malt
if
it
is
done
with
moderation
and
after
that
time
it
must
be
turned
every
six
hours
during
twenty
four
but
if
it
is
overheated
it
will
become
like
grease
and
be
spoiled
or
at
least
cause
the
drink
to
be
unwholsome
when
this
operation
is
over
it
then
must
be
put
on
the
kiln
to
dry
four
six
or
twelve
hours
according
to
the
nature
of
the
malt
for
the
pale
sort
requires
more
leisure
and
less
fire
than
the
amber
or
brown
sorts
three
inches
thick
was
formerly
thought
a
sufficient
depth
for
the
malt
to
lye
on
the
but
now
six
is
often
allowed
it
to
a
fault
fourteen
or
sixteen
foot
square
will
dry
about
two
quarters
if
the
malt
lyes
four
inches
thick
and
here
it
should
be
turned
every
two
three
or
four
hours
keeping
the
clear
the
time
of
preparing
it
from
the
cistern
to
the
kiln
is
uncertain
according
to
the
season
of
the
year
in
moderate
weather
three
weeks
is
often
sufficient
if
the
exciseman
takes
his
gage
on
the
floor
he
allows
ten
in
the
score
but
he
sometimes
gages
in
cistern
couch
floor
and
kiln
and
where
he
can
make
most
there
he
fixes
his
charge
when
the
malt
is
dryed
it
must
not
cool
on
the
kiln
but
be
directly
thrown
off
not
into
a
heap
but
spreaded
wide
in
an
airy
place
till
it
is
thoroughly
cool
then
put
it
into
a
heap
or
otherwise
dispose
of
it
there
are
several
methods
used
in
drying
of
malts
as
the
iron
the
that
are
both
full
of
little
holes
the
and
frame
and
the
the
iron
and
tyled
one
were
chiefly
invented
for
drying
of
brown
malts
and
saving
of
fuel
for
these
when
they
come
to
be
thorough
hot
will
make
the
corns
crack
and
jump
by
the
fierceness
of
their
heat
so
that
they
will
be
roasted
or
scorch
in
a
little
time
and
after
they
are
off
the
kiln
to
plump
the
body
of
the
corn
and
make
it
take
the
eye
some
will
sprinkle
water
over
it
that
it
may
meet
with
the
better
market
but
if
such
malt
is
not
used
quickly
it
will
slacken
and
lose
its
spirits
to
a
great
degree
and
perhaps
in
half
a
year
or
less
may
be
taken
by
the
whools
and
spoiled
such
hasty
dryings
or
scorchings
are
also
apt
to
bitter
the
malt
by
burning
its
skin
and
therefore
these
kilns
are
not
so
much
used
now
as
formerly
the
indeed
are
something
better
yet
they
are
apt
to
scorch
the
outward
part
of
the
corn
that
can
not
be
got
off
so
soon
as
the
admits
of
for
these
must
be
swept
when
the
other
is
only
turned
at
once
however
these
last
three
ways
are
now
in
much
request
for
drying
pale
and
amber
malts
because
their
fire
may
be
kept
with
more
leisure
and
the
malt
more
gradually
and
truer
dyed
but
by
many
the
is
reckoned
the
best
of
all
malts
are
dryed
with
several
sorts
of
fuel
as
the
coak
straw
wood
and
fern
but
the
coak
is
reckoned
by
most
to
exceed
all
others
for
making
drink
of
the
finest
flavour
and
pale
colour
because
it
sends
no
smoak
forth
to
hurt
the
malt
with
any
offensive
tang
that
wood
fern
and
straw
are
apt
to
do
in
a
lesser
or
greater
degree
but
there
is
a
difference
even
in
what
is
call
coak
the
right
sort
being
large
chark
or
burnt
in
some
measure
to
a
cinder
till
all
the
sulphur
is
consumed
and
evaporated
away
which
is
called
coak
and
this
when
it
is
truly
made
is
the
best
of
all
other
fuels
but
if
there
is
but
one
cinder
as
big
as
an
egg
that
is
not
thoroughly
cured
the
smoak
of
this
one
is
capable
of
doing
a
little
damage
and
this
happens
too
often
by
the
negligence
or
avarice
of
the
there
is
another
sort
by
some
wrongly
called
coak
and
rightly
named
culme
or
from
in
being
of
a
hard
stony
substance
in
small
bits
resembling
a
shining
coal
and
will
burn
without
smoak
and
by
its
sulphureous
effluvia
cast
a
most
excellent
whiteness
on
all
the
outward
parts
of
the
grainy
body
in
i
have
seen
their
marble
or
grey
burnt
into
lime
with
the
strong
fire
that
this
culme
makes
and
both
this
and
the
chark
affords
a
most
sweet
moderate
and
certain
fire
to
all
malt
that
is
dryed
by
it
straw
is
the
next
sweetest
fuel
but
wood
and
fern
worst
of
all
some
i
have
known
put
a
peck
or
more
of
peas
and
malt
them
with
five
quarters
of
barley
and
they
greatly
mellow
the
drink
and
so
will
beans
but
they
wo
come
so
soon
nor
mix
so
conveniently
with
the
malt
as
the
pea
will
i
knew
a
farmer
when
he
sends
five
quarters
of
barley
to
be
malted
puts
in
half
a
peck
or
more
of
oats
amongst
them
to
prove
he
has
justice
done
him
by
the
maker
who
is
hereby
confin
not
to
change
his
malt
by
reason
others
wo
like
such
a
mixture
but
there
is
an
abuse
sometimes
committed
by
a
necessitous
malster
who
to
come
by
malt
sooner
than
ordinary
makes
use
of
barley
before
it
is
thoroughly
sweated
in
the
mow
and
then
it
never
makes
right
malt
but
will
be
steely
and
not
yield
a
due
quantity
of
wort
as
i
knew
it
once
done
by
a
person
that
thrashed
the
barley
immediately
from
the
cart
as
it
was
brought
out
of
the
field
but
they
that
used
its
malt
suffered
not
a
little
for
it
was
impossible
it
should
be
good
because
it
did
not
thoroughly
chip
or
spire
on
the
floor
which
caused
this
sort
of
malt
when
the
water
was
put
to
it
in
the
to
swell
up
and
absorb
the
liquor
but
not
return
its
due
quantity
again
as
true
malt
would
nor
was
the
drink
of
this
malt
ever
good
in
the
barrel
but
remain
a
raw
insipid
beer
past
the
art
of
man
to
cure
because
this
like
cyder
made
from
apples
directly
off
the
tree
that
never
sweated
out
their
phlegmatick
crude
juice
in
the
heap
can
not
produce
a
natural
liquor
from
such
unnatural
management
for
barley
certainly
is
not
fit
to
make
malt
of
until
it
is
fully
mellowed
and
sweated
in
the
mow
and
the
season
of
the
year
is
ready
for
it
without
both
which
there
can
be
no
assurance
of
good
malt
several
instances
of
this
untimely
making
malt
i
have
known
to
happen
that
has
been
the
occasion
of
great
quantities
of
bad
ales
and
beers
for
such
malt
retaining
none
of
its
barley
nature
or
that
the
season
of
the
year
is
not
cold
enough
to
admit
of
its
natural
working
on
the
floor
is
not
capable
of
producing
a
true
malt
it
will
cause
its
drink
to
stink
in
the
cask
instead
of
growing
fit
for
use
as
not
having
its
genuine
to
cure
and
preserve
it
which
all
good
malts
contribute
to
as
well
as
the
hop
there
is
another
damage
i
have
known
accrue
to
the
buyer
of
malt
by
mellilet
a
most
stinking
weed
that
grows
amongst
some
barley
and
is
so
mischievously
predominant
as
to
taint
it
to
a
sad
degree
because
its
black
seed
like
that
of
an
onion
being
lesser
than
the
barley
can
not
be
entirely
separated
which
obliges
it
to
be
malted
with
the
barley
and
makes
the
drink
so
heady
that
it
is
apt
to
fuddle
the
unwary
by
drinking
a
small
quantity
this
weed
is
so
natural
to
some
ground
that
the
farmer
despairs
of
ever
extirpating
it
and
is
to
be
avoided
as
much
as
possible
because
it
very
much
hurts
the
drink
that
is
made
from
malt
mixed
with
it
by
its
nauseous
scent
and
taste
as
may
be
perceived
by
the
ointment
made
with
it
that
bears
its
name
i
knew
a
victualler
that
bought
a
parcel
of
malt
that
this
weed
was
amongst
and
it
spoiled
all
the
brewings
and
sale
of
the
drink
for
it
apt
to
cause
fevers
colicks
and
other
distempers
in
the
body
darnel
is
a
rampant
weed
and
grows
much
amongst
some
barley
especially
in
the
bad
husbandman
ground
and
most
where
it
is
sown
with
the
it
does
the
least
harm
amongst
malt
because
it
adds
a
strength
to
it
and
quickly
intoxicates
if
there
is
much
in
it
but
where
there
is
but
little
the
malster
regards
it
not
for
the
sake
of
its
inebriating
quality
there
are
other
weeds
or
seeds
that
annoy
the
barley
but
as
the
screen
sieve
and
throwing
will
take
most
of
them
out
there
does
not
require
here
a
detail
of
their
particulars
oats
malted
as
barley
is
will
make
a
weak
soft
mellow
and
pleasant
drink
but
wheat
when
done
so
will
produce
a
strong
heady
nourishing
and
fine
liquor
which
is
now
more
practised
then
ever
chap
iii
know
good
from
malts
this
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
all
brewers
both
publick
and
private
for
is
common
for
the
seller
to
cry
all
is
good
but
the
buyer
case
is
different
wherefore
it
is
prudential
to
endeavour
to
be
master
of
this
knowledge
but
i
have
heard
a
great
malster
that
lived
towards
say
he
knew
a
grand
brewer
that
wetted
near
two
hundred
quarters
a
week
was
not
a
judge
of
good
and
bad
malts
without
which
is
impossible
to
draw
a
true
length
of
ale
or
beer
to
do
this
i
know
but
of
few
ways
by
the
bite
is
to
break
the
malt
corn
across
between
the
teeth
in
the
middle
of
it
or
at
both
ends
and
if
it
tasteth
mellow
and
sweet
has
a
round
body
breaks
soft
is
full
of
flower
all
its
length
smells
well
and
has
a
thin
skin
then
it
is
good
by
water
is
to
take
a
glass
near
full
and
put
in
some
malt
and
if
it
swims
it
is
right
but
if
any
sinks
to
the
bottom
then
it
is
not
true
malt
but
steely
and
retains
somewhat
of
its
barley
nature
yet
i
must
own
this
is
not
an
infallible
rule
because
if
a
corn
of
malt
is
crack
split
or
broke
it
will
then
take
the
water
and
sink
but
there
may
an
allowance
be
given
for
such
incidents
and
still
room
enough
to
make
a
judgment
malt
that
is
truly
made
will
not
be
hard
and
steely
but
of
so
mellow
a
nature
that
if
forced
against
a
dry
board
will
mark
and
cast
a
white
colour
almost
like
chalk
malt
that
is
not
rightly
made
will
be
part
of
it
of
a
hard
barley
nature
and
weigh
heavier
than
that
which
is
true
malt
chap
iv
the
nature
and
use
of
pale
amber
and
malts
the
pale
malt
is
the
slowest
and
slackest
dryed
of
any
and
where
it
has
had
a
leisure
fire
a
sufficient
time
allowed
it
on
the
kiln
and
a
due
care
taken
of
it
the
flower
of
the
grain
will
remain
in
its
full
quantity
and
thereby
produce
a
greater
length
of
wort
than
the
brown
high
dryed
malt
for
which
reason
it
is
sold
for
one
or
two
shillings
quarter
more
than
that
this
pale
malt
is
also
the
most
nutritious
sort
to
the
body
of
all
others
as
being
in
this
state
the
most
simple
and
nearest
to
its
original
that
will
retain
an
alcalous
and
balsamick
quality
much
longer
than
the
brown
sort
the
tender
drying
of
this
malt
bringing
its
body
into
so
soft
a
texture
of
parts
that
most
of
the
great
brewers
brew
it
with
spring
and
whose
hard
and
binding
properties
they
think
agrees
best
with
this
malt
either
in
ales
or
beer
and
which
will
also
dispense
with
hotter
waters
in
brewing
of
it
than
the
brown
malt
can
the
malt
is
that
which
is
dryed
in
a
medium
degree
between
the
pale
and
the
brown
and
is
very
much
in
use
as
being
free
of
either
extream
its
colour
is
pleasant
its
taste
agreeable
and
its
nature
wholsome
which
makes
it
be
by
many
as
the
best
of
malts
this
by
some
is
brewed
either
with
hard
or
soft
waters
or
a
mixture
of
both
the
brown
malt
is
the
soonest
and
highest
dryed
of
any
even
till
it
is
so
hard
that
it
difficult
to
bite
some
of
its
corns
asunder
and
is
often
so
crusted
or
burnt
that
the
farinous
part
loses
a
great
deal
of
its
essential
salts
and
vital
property
which
frequently
deceives
its
ignorant
brewer
that
hopes
to
draw
as
much
drink
from
a
quarter
of
this
as
he
does
from
pale
or
amber
sorts
this
malt
by
some
is
thought
to
occasion
the
gravel
and
stone
besides
what
is
commonly
called
the
and
is
by
its
steely
nature
less
nourishing
than
the
pale
or
amber
malts
being
very
much
impregnated
with
the
fiery
fumiferous
particles
of
the
kiln
and
therefore
its
drink
sooner
becomes
sharp
and
acid
than
that
made
from
the
pale
or
amber
sorts
if
they
are
all
fairly
brewed
for
this
reason
the
brewers
mostly
use
the
or
waters
to
brew
this
malt
with
for
the
sake
of
its
soft
nature
whereby
it
agrees
with
the
harsh
qualities
of
it
better
than
any
of
the
well
or
other
hard
sorts
and
makes
a
luscious
ale
for
a
little
while
and
a
that
will
keep
very
well
five
or
six
months
but
after
that
time
it
generally
grows
stale
notwithstanding
there
be
ten
or
twelve
bushels
allowed
to
the
hogshead
and
it
be
hopp
accordingly
pale
and
amber
malts
dryed
with
coak
or
culm
obtains
a
more
clean
bright
pale
colour
than
if
dryed
with
any
other
fuel
because
there
is
not
smoak
to
darken
and
sully
their
skins
or
husks
and
give
them
an
ill
relish
that
those
malts
little
or
more
have
which
are
dryed
with
straw
wood
or
fern
the
coak
or
coal
also
makes
more
true
and
compleat
malt
as
i
have
before
hinted
than
any
other
fuel
because
its
fire
gives
both
a
gentle
and
certain
heat
whereby
the
corns
are
in
all
their
parts
gradually
dryed
and
therefore
of
late
these
malts
have
gained
such
a
reputation
that
great
quantities
have
been
consumed
in
most
parts
of
the
nation
for
their
wholsome
natures
and
sweet
fine
taste
these
make
such
fine
ales
and
as
has
tempted
several
of
our
malsters
in
my
to
burn
coak
or
culm
at
a
great
expence
of
carriage
thirty
miles
from
next
to
the
malt
the
is
the
sweetest
and
best
tasted
this
i
must
own
is
sometimes
well
malted
where
the
barley
wheat
straw
conveniencies
and
the
maker
skill
are
good
but
as
the
fire
of
the
straw
is
not
so
regular
as
the
coak
the
malt
is
attended
with
more
uncertainty
in
its
making
because
it
is
difficult
to
keep
it
to
a
moderate
and
equal
heat
and
also
exposes
the
malt
in
some
degree
to
the
taste
of
the
smoak
brown
malts
are
dryed
with
straw
wood
and
fern
the
is
not
the
best
but
the
wood
sort
has
a
most
unnatural
taste
that
few
can
bear
with
but
the
necessitous
and
those
that
are
accustomed
to
its
strong
smoaky
tang
yet
is
it
much
used
in
some
of
the
western
parts
of
and
many
thousand
quarters
of
this
malt
has
been
formerly
used
in
for
brewing
the
with
and
that
because
it
sold
for
two
shillings
quarter
cheaper
than
the
malt
nor
was
this
quality
of
the
malt
much
regarded
by
some
of
its
brewers
for
that
its
ill
taste
is
lost
in
nine
or
twelve
months
by
the
age
of
the
beer
and
the
strength
of
the
great
quantity
of
hops
that
were
used
in
its
preservation
the
malt
is
also
attended
with
a
rank
disagreeable
taste
from
the
smoak
of
this
vegetable
with
which
many
quarters
of
malt
are
dryed
as
appears
by
the
great
quantities
annually
cut
by
malsters
on
our
commons
for
the
two
prevalent
reasons
of
cheapness
and
plenty
at
in
i
knew
an
use
half
pale
and
half
brown
malt
for
brewing
his
that
proved
to
my
palate
the
best
i
ever
drank
on
the
road
which
i
think
may
be
accounted
for
in
that
the
pale
being
the
slackest
and
the
brown
the
hardest
dryed
must
produce
a
mellow
good
drink
by
the
help
of
a
requisite
age
that
will
reduce
those
extreams
to
a
proper
quality
chap
the
nature
of
several
waters
and
their
use
in
brewing
and
first
of
water
next
to
malt
is
what
by
course
comes
here
under
consideration
as
a
matter
of
great
importance
in
brewing
of
wholsome
fine
and
is
of
such
consequence
that
it
concerns
every
one
to
know
the
nature
of
the
water
he
brews
with
because
it
is
the
vehicle
by
which
the
nutritious
and
pleasant
particles
of
the
malt
and
hop
are
conveyed
into
our
bodies
and
there
becomes
a
diluter
of
our
food
now
the
more
simple
and
freer
every
water
is
from
foreign
particles
the
better
it
will
answer
those
ends
and
purposes
for
as
observes
some
waters
are
so
loaded
with
stony
corpuscles
that
even
the
pipes
thro
which
they
are
carried
in
time
are
incrusted
and
stopt
up
by
them
and
is
of
that
petrifying
nature
as
to
breed
the
stone
in
the
bladder
which
many
of
the
have
been
instances
of
by
using
this
sort
of
water
out
of
the
river
and
of
this
nature
is
another
at
in
which
in
no
great
distance
of
time
so
clogs
the
wheel
of
an
overshot
mill
there
that
they
are
forced
with
convenient
instruments
to
cut
way
for
its
motion
and
what
makes
it
still
more
evident
is
the
sight
of
those
incrusted
sides
of
the
that
the
hard
are
the
occasion
of
by
being
often
boiled
in
them
and
it
is
further
related
by
the
same
doctor
that
a
gentlewoman
afflicted
with
frequent
returns
of
violent
colick
pains
was
cured
by
the
advice
of
only
by
leaving
off
drinking
beer
brewed
with
it
true
such
a
fluid
has
a
greater
force
and
aptness
to
extract
the
tincture
out
of
malt
than
is
to
be
had
in
the
more
innocent
and
soft
liquor
of
rivers
but
for
this
very
reason
it
ought
not
unless
upon
meer
necessity
to
be
made
use
of
this
quality
being
owing
to
the
mineral
particles
and
alluminous
salts
with
which
it
is
impregnated
for
these
waters
thus
saturated
will
by
their
various
gravities
in
circulation
deposit
themselves
in
one
part
of
the
animal
body
or
other
which
has
made
some
prove
the
goodness
of
water
by
the
lightness
of
its
body
in
the
water
scales
now
sold
in
several
of
the
shops
in
order
to
avoid
the
scorbutick
colicky
hypochondriack
and
other
ill
effects
of
the
clayey
and
other
gross
particles
of
stagnating
and
the
calculous
concretions
of
others
and
therefore
such
waters
ought
to
be
mistrusted
more
than
any
where
they
are
not
pure
clear
and
soft
or
that
do
arise
from
good
chalks
or
stony
rocks
that
are
generally
allowed
to
afford
the
best
of
all
the
well
sorts
are
in
general
liable
to
partake
of
those
minerals
which
they
pass
and
are
salubrious
or
mischievous
accordingly
at
in
their
water
is
said
to
come
off
an
and
so
tints
their
beer
with
its
saline
quality
that
it
is
easily
tasted
at
the
first
draught
and
at
in
i
have
seen
the
very
stones
colour
the
rusty
iron
by
the
constant
running
of
a
but
that
which
will
lather
with
soap
or
such
soft
water
that
percolates
through
chalk
or
a
grey
is
generally
accounted
best
for
chalks
in
this
respect
excell
all
other
earths
in
that
it
administers
nothing
unwholsome
to
the
perfluent
waters
but
undoubtedly
absorps
by
its
drying
spungy
quality
any
ill
minerals
that
may
accompany
the
water
that
runs
thro
them
for
which
reason
they
throw
in
great
quantities
of
chalk
into
their
wells
at
to
soften
their
water
which
coming
off
a
black
is
so
hard
and
sharp
that
it
will
often
turn
their
beer
sour
in
a
week
time
so
that
in
its
original
state
it
neither
fit
to
wash
nor
brew
with
but
so
long
as
the
alcalous
soft
particles
of
the
chalk
holds
good
they
put
it
to
both
uses
are
less
liable
to
be
loaded
with
metallick
petrifying
saline
and
other
insanous
particles
of
the
earth
than
the
well
or
spring
sorts
are
especially
at
some
distance
from
the
because
the
rain
water
mixes
with
and
softens
it
and
are
also
much
cured
by
the
heat
and
the
air
power
for
which
reason
i
have
known
several
so
strict
that
they
wo
let
their
horses
drink
near
the
first
rise
of
some
of
them
this
i
have
seen
the
sad
effects
of
and
which
has
obliged
me
to
avoid
two
that
run
cross
a
road
in
and
but
in
their
runnings
they
often
collect
gross
particles
from
ouzy
muddy
mixtures
particularly
near
town
that
make
the
beer
subject
to
new
fermentations
and
grow
foul
upon
alteration
of
weather
as
the
water
generlly
does
yet
is
this
for
its
softness
much
better
than
the
hard
sort
however
both
these
waters
are
used
by
some
brewers
as
i
shall
hereafter
observe
but
where
a
can
be
had
clear
in
a
dry
time
when
no
great
rain
has
lately
fell
out
of
rivulets
or
rivers
that
have
a
gravelly
chalky
sandy
or
free
from
the
disturbance
of
cattle
and
in
good
air
as
that
of
in
is
it
may
then
justly
claim
the
name
of
a
most
excellent
water
for
brewing
and
will
make
a
stronger
drink
with
the
same
quantity
of
malt
than
any
of
the
insomuch
that
that
of
the
has
been
proved
to
make
as
strong
beer
with
seven
bushels
of
malt
as
with
eight
and
so
are
all
in
a
proportionable
degree
and
where
they
can
be
obtain
clean
and
pure
drink
may
be
drawn
fine
in
a
few
days
after
tunning
is
very
soft
of
a
most
simple
and
pure
nature
and
the
best
diluter
of
any
especially
if
received
free
from
dirt
and
the
salt
of
mortar
that
often
mixes
with
it
as
it
runs
off
tyled
roofs
this
is
very
agreeable
for
brewing
of
ales
that
are
not
to
be
kept
a
great
while
but
for
beers
that
are
to
remain
some
time
in
the
casks
it
is
not
so
well
as
being
apt
to
putrify
the
soonest
of
any
this
includes
all
standing
waters
chiefly
from
rain
and
are
good
or
bad
as
they
happen
for
where
there
is
a
clean
bottom
and
the
water
lies
undisturbed
from
the
tread
of
cattle
or
too
many
fish
in
an
open
sound
air
in
a
large
quantity
and
where
the
sun
has
free
access
it
then
comes
near
if
not
quite
as
good
as
rain
or
as
is
that
of
pond
on
the
high
green
at
in
and
many
others
which
are
often
prefer
for
brewing
even
beyond
many
of
the
soft
about
them
but
where
it
is
in
a
small
quantity
or
full
of
fish
especially
the
sling
tench
or
is
so
disturbed
by
cattle
as
to
force
up
mud
and
filth
it
is
then
the
most
foul
and
disagreeable
of
all
others
so
is
it
likewise
in
long
dry
seasons
when
our
are
so
low
as
obliges
us
to
strain
it
thro
sieves
before
we
can
use
it
to
take
out
the
small
red
worms
and
other
corruptions
that
our
stagnant
waters
are
generally
then
too
full
of
the
latest
and
best
doctors
have
so
far
scrutinized
into
the
prime
cause
of
our
malady
the
scurvy
as
to
affirm
its
first
rise
is
from
our
unwholesome
stagnating
waters
and
especially
those
that
come
off
a
clayey
surface
as
there
are
about
and
for
that
where
the
waters
are
worst
there
this
distemper
is
most
common
so
that
in
their
writings
they
have
put
it
out
of
all
doubt
that
most
of
our
complicated
symptoms
that
are
under
this
general
name
if
they
do
take
their
beginning
from
such
water
do
own
it
to
be
their
chief
cause
chap
vi
malts
as
trifling
as
this
article
in
brewing
may
seem
at
first
it
very
worthily
deserves
the
notice
of
all
concern
therein
for
on
this
depends
much
the
good
of
our
drink
because
if
it
is
ground
too
small
the
flower
of
the
malt
will
be
the
easier
and
more
freely
mix
with
the
water
and
then
will
cause
the
wort
to
run
thick
and
therefore
the
malt
must
be
only
just
broke
in
the
mill
to
make
it
emit
its
spirit
gradually
and
incorporate
its
flower
with
the
water
in
such
a
manner
that
first
a
stout
beer
then
an
ale
and
afterwards
a
small
beer
may
be
had
at
one
and
the
same
brewing
and
the
wort
run
off
fine
and
clear
to
the
last
many
are
likewise
so
sagacious
as
to
grind
their
brown
malt
a
fortnight
before
they
use
it
and
keep
it
in
a
dry
place
from
the
influence
of
too
moist
an
air
that
it
may
become
mellower
by
losing
in
a
great
measure
the
fury
of
its
harsh
fiery
particles
and
its
steely
nature
which
this
sort
of
malt
acquires
on
the
kiln
however
this
as
well
as
many
other
hard
bodies
may
be
reduced
by
time
and
air
into
a
more
soluble
mellow
and
soft
condition
and
then
it
will
imbibe
the
water
and
give
a
natural
kind
tincture
more
freely
by
which
a
greater
quantity
and
stronger
drink
may
be
made
than
if
it
was
used
directly
from
the
mill
and
be
much
smoother
and
better
tasted
but
the
pale
malt
will
be
fit
for
use
at
a
week
end
because
the
leisureness
of
their
drying
endows
them
with
a
softness
from
the
time
they
are
taken
off
the
kiln
to
the
time
they
are
brewed
and
supplies
in
them
what
time
and
air
must
do
in
the
brown
sorts
this
method
of
grinding
malt
so
long
ca
be
so
conveniently
practised
by
some
of
the
great
brewers
because
several
of
them
brew
two
or
three
times
a
week
but
now
most
of
them
out
of
good
husbandry
grind
their
malts
into
the
tun
by
the
help
of
a
long
descending
wooden
spout
and
here
they
save
the
charge
of
emptying
or
uncasing
it
out
of
the
bin
which
formerly
they
used
to
do
before
this
new
way
was
discovered
and
also
the
waste
of
a
great
deal
of
the
that
was
lost
when
carryed
in
baskets
whereas
now
the
cover
of
the
tun
presents
all
that
damage
in
my
common
brewhouse
at
i
ground
my
malt
between
two
large
stones
by
the
that
with
one
horse
would
grind
blank
space
quarters
an
hour
but
in
the
country
i
use
a
steel
that
cost
at
first
forty
shillings
which
will
by
the
help
of
only
one
man
grind
six
or
eight
bushels
in
an
hour
and
will
last
a
family
many
years
without
hardning
or
cutting
there
are
some
stone
in
being
that
some
are
votaries
for
and
prefer
to
the
iron
ones
because
they
alledge
that
these
break
the
corn
body
when
the
iron
ones
only
cut
it
in
two
which
occasions
the
malt
so
broke
by
the
stones
to
give
the
water
a
more
easy
free
and
regular
power
to
extract
its
virtue
than
the
can
that
is
more
confin
within
its
hull
notwithstanding
the
iron
ones
are
now
mostly
in
use
for
their
great
dispatch
and
long
duration
in
the
country
it
is
frequently
done
by
some
to
throw
a
sack
of
malt
on
a
stone
or
as
soon
as
it
is
ground
and
there
let
it
lye
giving
it
one
turn
for
a
day
or
two
that
the
stones
or
bricks
may
draw
out
the
fiery
quality
it
received
from
the
kiln
and
give
the
drink
a
soft
mild
taste

labour
to
brew
a
great
deal
as
well
as
a
little
from
hence
it
partly
is
that
we
meet
with
such
ales
and
beers
as
are
not
only
disagreeable
in
taste
and
foulness
but
indeed
unwholsome
to
the
body
of
man
for
as
it
is
often
drank
thick
and
voided
thin
the
feces
or
gross
part
must
in
my
opinion
remain
behind
in
some
degree
now
what
the
effects
of
that
may
be
i
must
own
i
am
not
physician
enough
to
explain
but
shrewdly
suspect
it
may
be
the
cause
of
stones
colicks
obstructions
and
several
other
chronical
distempers
for
if
we
consider
that
the
sediments
of
are
the
refuse
of
a
corrupted
grain
loaded
with
the
igneous
acid
particles
of
the
malt
and
then
again
with
the
corrosive
sharp
particles
of
the
yeast
it
must
consequently
be
very
pernicious
to
the
human
body
especially
which
certainly
suffers
much
from
the
animal
salts
of
the
great
quantities
of
flesh
that
we
eat
more
than
people
of
any
other
nation
whatsoever
and
therefore
are
more
then
ordinarily
obligated
not
to
add
the
scorbutick
mucilaginous
qualities
of
such
gross
unwholsome
particles
that
every
one
makes
a
lodgment
of
in
their
bodies
as
the
liquors
they
drink
are
more
or
less
thick
for
in
plain
truth
no
can
be
good
without
it
fine
the
late
curious
esq
of
whom
i
have
had
the
honour
to
drink
some
of
his
famous
with
thought
the
true
art
of
brewing
of
such
importance
that
it
is
said
to
cost
him
near
twenty
pounds
to
have
an
old
taught
it
by
a
brewer
and
sure
it
was
this
very
man
exceeded
all
others
in
these
parts
afterwards
in
the
brewing
of
that
which
he
called
his
beer
so
likewise
in
they
lay
such
stress
on
this
art
that
many
have
thought
it
worth
their
while
to
give
one
or
two
hundred
guineas
with
an
apprentice
this
consideration
also
made
an
ambassador
give
an
extraordinary
encouragement
to
one
of
my
acquaintance
to
go
over
with
him
that
was
a
great
master
of
this
science
but
notwithstanding
all
that
can
be
said
that
relates
to
this
subject
there
are
so
many
incidents
attending
that
it
has
puzled
several
expert
men
to
account
for
their
difference
though
brewed
by
the
same
brewer
with
the
same
malt
hops
and
water
and
in
the
same
month
and
town
and
tapp
at
the
same
time
the
beer
of
one
being
fine
strong
and
well
tasted
while
the
others
have
not
had
any
worth
drinking
now
this
may
be
owing
to
the
different
weather
in
the
same
month
that
might
cause
an
alteration
in
the
working
of
the
liquors
or
that
the
cellar
may
not
be
so
convenient
or
that
the
water
was
more
disturbed
by
winds
or
rains
but
it
has
been
observed
that
where
a
gentleman
has
imployed
one
brewer
constantly
and
uses
the
same
sort
of
ingredients
and
the
beer
kept
in
dry
vaults
or
cellars
that
have
two
or
three
doors
the
drink
has
been
generally
good
and
where
such
are
kept
in
butts
more
time
is
required
to
ripen
meliorate
and
fine
them
than
those
kept
in
hogsheads
because
the
greater
quantity
must
have
the
longer
time
so
also
a
greater
quantity
will
preserve
itself
better
than
a
lesser
one
and
on
this
account
the
butt
and
hogshead
are
the
two
best
sized
casks
of
all
others
but
all
under
a
hogshead
hold
rather
too
small
a
quantity
to
keep
their
bodies
the
butt
is
certainly
a
most
noble
cask
for
this
use
as
being
generally
set
upright
whereby
it
maintains
a
large
cover
of
yeast
that
greatly
contributes
to
the
keeping
in
the
spirits
of
the
beer
admits
of
a
most
convenient
broaching
in
the
middle
and
its
lower
part
and
by
its
broad
level
bottom
gives
a
better
lodgment
to
the
fining
and
preserving
ingredients
than
any
other
cask
whatsoever
that
lyes
in
the
long
hence
it
partly
is
that
the
common
is
at
this
time
in
greater
reputation
than
ever
in
and
the
drinks
out
of
credit
because
the
first
is
better
cured
in
its
brewing
in
its
quantity
in
its
cask
and
in
its
age
when
the
latter
has
been
loaded
with
the
pernicious
particles
of
great
quantities
of
yeast
of
a
short
age
and
kept
in
small
casks
that
confines
its
owner
only
to
winter
brewing
and
sale
as
not
being
capable
of
sustaining
the
heat
of
the
weather
for
that
the
acidity
of
the
yeast
brings
on
a
sudden
hardness
and
staleness
of
the
ale
which
to
preserve
in
its
mild
aley
taste
will
not
admit
of
any
great
quantity
of
hops
and
this
is
partly
the
reason
that
the
handful
of
salt
which
the
brewers
put
into
their
hogshead
hinders
their
ale
from
keeping
as
i
shall
hereafter
take
notice
of
chap
viii
london
of
in
a
great
brewhouse
that
i
was
concern
in
they
wetted
or
used
a
considerable
quantity
of
malt
in
one
week
in
brewing
common
ale
and
small
beer
for
which
purpose
they
have
river
and
well
waters
which
they
take
in
several
degrees
of
heat
as
the
malt
goods
and
grain
are
in
a
condition
to
receive
them
and
according
to
the
practice
there
i
shall
relate
the
following
particulars
viz
stout
butt
this
is
the
strongest
that
is
brewed
from
brown
malt
and
often
sold
for
forty
shillings
the
barrel
or
six
pound
the
butt
out
of
the
wholesale
cellars
the
liquor
for
it
is
sixpence
forfeit
in
the
brewhouse
if
the
word
water
is
named
in
the
copper
designed
for
the
first
mash
has
a
two
bushel
basket
or
more
of
the
most
hully
malt
over
it
to
cover
its
top
and
forward
its
boiling
this
must
be
made
very
hot
almost
ready
to
boil
yet
not
so
as
to
blister
for
then
it
will
be
in
too
high
a
heat
but
as
an
indication
of
this
the
foul
part
of
the
liquor
will
ascend
and
the
malt
swell
up
and
then
it
must
be
parted
look
into
and
felt
with
the
finger
or
back
of
the
hand
and
if
the
liquor
is
clear
and
can
but
be
just
endured
it
is
then
enough
and
the
stoker
must
damp
his
fire
as
soon
as
possible
by
throwing
in
a
good
parcel
of
fresh
coals
and
shutting
his
iron
vent
doors
if
there
are
any
immediately
on
this
they
let
as
much
cold
liquor
or
water
run
into
the
copper
as
will
make
it
all
of
a
heat
somewhat
more
than
this
they
pump
over
or
let
it
pass
by
a
cock
into
an
upright
wooden
square
spout
or
trunk
and
it
directly
rises
thro
the
holes
of
a
false
bottom
into
the
malt
which
is
work
by
several
men
with
oars
for
about
half
an
hour
and
is
called
the
first
and
stiff
mash
while
this
is
doing
there
is
more
liquor
heating
in
the
copper
that
must
not
be
let
into
the
mash
tun
till
it
is
very
sharp
almost
ready
to
boil
with
this
they
mash
again
then
cover
it
with
several
baskets
of
malt
and
let
it
stand
an
hour
before
it
runs
into
the
which
when
boiled
an
hour
and
a
half
with
a
good
quantity
of
hops
makes
this
stout
the
next
is
with
a
cooler
liquor
then
a
sharper
and
the
next
or
quite
cold
by
which
alternate
degrees
of
heat
a
quantity
of
small
beer
is
made
after
the
stout
brewing
strong
brown
ale
stitch
this
is
most
of
it
the
first
running
of
the
malt
but
yet
of
a
longer
length
than
is
drawn
for
the
stout
it
has
but
few
hops
boiled
in
it
and
is
sold
for
gallon
at
the
brewhouse
out
of
the
tun
and
is
generally
made
to
amend
the
common
brown
ale
with
on
particular
occasions
this
ale
i
remember
was
made
use
of
by
blank
space
esq
in
the
beginning
of
a
consumption
and
i
heard
him
say
it
did
him
very
great
service
for
he
lived
many
years
afterwards
brewing
common
brown
ale
and
starting
they
take
the
liquors
from
the
brown
ale
as
for
the
stout
but
draw
a
greater
quantity
from
the
malt
than
for
stout
or
stitch
and
after
the
fifth
and
second
mash
they
cap
the
goods
with
fresh
malt
to
keep
in
the
spirit
and
boil
it
an
hour
after
this
small
beer
is
made
of
the
same
goods
thus
also
the
common
brown
starting
is
brewed
only
boiled
with
more
hops
an
hour
and
a
half
and
work
cooler
and
longer
than
the
brown
ale
and
a
shorter
length
drawn
from
the
malt
but
it
is
often
practised
after
the
brown
ale
and
where
a
quantity
of
small
beer
is
wanted
or
that
it
is
to
be
brewed
better
than
ordinary
to
put
so
much
fresh
malt
on
the
goods
as
will
answer
that
purpose
brewing
pale
and
amber
ales
and
as
the
brown
malts
are
brewed
with
river
these
are
brewed
with
well
or
spring
liquors
the
liquors
are
by
some
taken
sharper
for
pale
than
brown
malts
and
after
the
first
scalding
liquor
is
put
over
some
lower
the
rest
by
degrees
to
the
last
which
is
quite
cold
for
their
small
beer
so
also
for
there
is
no
other
difference
than
the
addition
of
more
hops
and
boiling
and
the
method
of
working
but
the
reasons
for
brewing
pale
malts
with
spring
or
hard
well
waters
i
have
mentioned
in
my
second
book
of
brewing
brewing
entire
guile
small
on
the
first
liquor
they
throw
some
hully
malt
to
shew
the
break
of
it
and
when
it
is
very
sharp
they
let
in
some
cold
liquor
and
run
it
into
the
tun
milk
warm
this
is
mash
with
thirty
or
forty
pulls
of
the
oar
and
let
stand
till
the
second
liquor
is
ready
which
must
be
almost
scalding
hot
to
the
back
of
the
hand
then
run
it
by
the
cock
into
the
tun
mash
it
up
and
let
it
stand
an
hour
before
it
is
spended
off
into
the
these
two
pieces
of
liquor
will
make
one
copper
of
the
first
wort
without
putting
any
fresh
malt
on
the
goods
the
next
liquor
to
be
the
next
sharp
and
the
next
cool
or
cold
for
the
general
way
in
great
brewhouses
is
to
let
a
cool
liquor
precede
a
sharp
one
because
it
gradually
opens
the
pores
of
the
malt
and
goods
and
prepares
the
way
for
the
hotter
liquor
that
is
to
follow
several
lengths
or
quantities
of
drinks
that
have
been
made
from
malt
and
their
several
prices
as
they
have
been
sold
at
a
common
for

commonly
drawn
one
barrel
off
a
quarter
of
malt
and
sold
for
thirty
shillings

chap
ix
country
or
private
way
of
several
countries
have
their
several
methods
of
brewing
as
is
practised
in
dorchester
nottingham
and
many
other
places
but
evading
particulars
i
shall
here
recommend
that
which
i
think
is
most
serviceable
both
in
country
and
private
families
and
first
i
shall
observe
that
the
great
brewer
has
some
advantages
in
brewing
more
than
the
small
one
and
yet
the
latter
has
some
conveniences
which
the
former
ca
enjoy
for
is
certain
that
the
great
brewer
can
make
more
drink
and
draw
a
greater
length
in
proportion
to
his
malt
than
a
person
can
from
a
lesser
quantity
because
the
greater
the
body
the
more
is
its
united
power
in
receiving
and
discharging
and
he
can
brew
with
less
charge
and
trouble
by
means
of
his
more
convenient
utensils
but
then
the
private
brewer
is
not
without
his
benefits
for
he
can
have
his
malt
ground
at
pleasure
his
tubs
and
moveable
coolers
sweeter
and
better
clean
than
the
great
fixed
tuns
and
backs
he
can
skim
off
his
top
yeast
and
leave
his
bottom
lees
behind
which
is
what
the
great
brewer
ca
so
well
do
he
can
at
discretion
make
additions
of
cold
wort
to
his
too
forward
ales
and
beers
which
the
great
brewer
ca
so
conveniently
do
he
can
brew
how
and
when
he
pleases
which
the
great
ones
are
in
some
measure
hindred
from
but
to
come
nearer
the
matter
i
will
suppose
a
private
family
to
brew
five
bushels
of
malt
whose
copper
holds
thirty
six
gallons
or
a
barrel
on
this
water
we
put
half
a
peck
of
bran
or
malt
when
it
is
something
hot
which
will
much
forward
it
by
keep
in
the
steams
or
spirit
of
the
water
and
when
it
begins
to
boil
if
the
water
is
foul
skim
off
the
bran
or
malt
and
give
it
the
hogs
or
else
lade
both
water
and
that
into
the
mash
vat
where
it
is
to
remain
till
the
steam
is
near
spent
and
you
can
see
your
face
in
it
which
will
be
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
cold
weather
then
let
all
but
half
a
bushel
of
the
malt
run
very
leisurely
into
it
stirring
it
all
the
while
with
an
oar
or
paddle
that
it
may
not
ball
and
when
the
malt
is
all
but
just
mix
with
water
it
is
enough
which
i
am
sensible
is
different
from
the
old
way
and
the
general
present
practice
but
i
shall
here
clear
that
point
for
by
not
stirring
or
mashing
the
malt
into
a
pudding
consistence
or
thin
mash
the
body
of
it
lies
in
a
more
loose
condition
that
will
easier
and
sooner
admit
of
a
quicker
and
more
true
passage
of
the
of
the
several
bowls
or
jets
of
hot
water
which
must
run
thorough
it
before
the
brewing
is
ended
by
which
free
percolation
the
water
has
ready
access
to
all
the
parts
of
the
broken
malt
so
that
the
brewer
is
capacitated
to
brew
quicker
or
slower
and
to
make
more
ale
or
small
beer
if
more
ale
then
hot
boiling
water
must
be
laded
over
to
slow
that
one
bowl
must
run
almost
off
before
another
is
put
over
which
will
occasion
the
whole
brewing
to
last
about
sixteen
hours
especially
if
the
way
is
followed
of
spending
it
out
of
the
tap
as
small
as
a
straw
and
as
fine
as
sack
and
then
it
will
be
quickly
so
in
the
barrel
of
if
less
or
weaker
ale
is
to
be
made
and
good
small
beer
then
the
second
copper
of
boiling
water
may
be
put
over
expeditiously
and
drawn
out
with
a
large
and
fast
steam
after
the
first
stirring
of
the
malt
is
done
then
put
over
the
reserve
of
half
a
bushel
of
fresh
malt
to
the
four
bushels
and
half
that
is
already
in
the
tub
which
must
be
spread
all
over
it
and
also
cover
the
top
of
the
tub
with
some
sacks
or
other
cloths
to
keep
in
the
steam
or
spirit
of
the
malt
then
let
it
stand
two
or
three
hours
at
the
end
of
which
put
over
now
and
then
a
bowl
of
the
boiling
water
in
the
copper
as
is
before
directed
and
so
continue
to
do
till
as
much
is
run
off
as
will
almost
fill
the
copper
then
in
a
canvas
or
other
loose
woven
cloth
put
in
half
a
pound
of
hops
and
boil
them
half
an
hour
when
they
must
be
taken
out
and
as
many
fresh
ones
put
in
their
room
as
is
judged
proper
to
boil
half
an
hour
more
if
for
ale
but
if
for
keeping
beer
half
a
pound
of
fresh
ones
should
be
put
in
at
every
half
hour
end
and
boil
an
hour
and
a
half
briskly
now
while
the
first
copper
of
wort
is
boiling
there
should
be
scalding
water
leisurely
put
over
the
goods
bowl
by
bowl
and
run
off
that
the
copper
may
be
filled
again
immediately
after
the
first
is
out
and
boiled
an
hour
with
near
the
same
quantity
of
fresh
hops
and
in
the
same
manner
as
those
in
the
first
copper
of
were
the
rest
for
small
beer
may
be
all
cold
water
put
over
the
grains
at
once
or
at
twice
and
boil
an
hour
each
copper
with
the
hops
that
has
been
before
but
here
i
must
observe
that
sometimes
i
have
not
an
opportunity
to
get
hot
water
for
making
all
my
second
copper
of
wort
which
obliges
me
then
to
make
use
of
cold
to
supply
what
was
wanting
out
of
five
bushels
of
malt
i
generally
make
a
hogshead
of
ale
with
the
two
first
coppers
of
wort
and
a
hogshead
of
small
beer
with
the
other
two
but
this
more
or
less
according
to
please
me
always
taking
care
to
let
each
copper
of
wort
be
strained
off
thro
a
sieve
and
cool
in
four
or
five
tubs
to
prevent
its
foxing
thus
i
have
brewed
many
hogsheads
of
midling
ale
that
when
the
malt
is
good
has
proved
strong
enough
for
myself
and
satisfactory
to
my
friends
but
for
strong
keeping
beer
the
first
copper
of
wort
may
be
wholly
put
to
that
use
and
all
the
rest
small
beer
or
when
the
first
copper
of
wort
is
intirely
made
use
of
for
strong
beer
the
goods
may
be
help
with
more
fresh
malt
according
to
the
fashion
and
water
lukewarm
put
over
at
first
with
the
bowl
but
soon
after
sharp
or
boiling
water
which
may
make
a
copper
of
good
ale
and
small
beer
after
that
in
some
parts
of
the
north
they
take
one
or
more
cinders
red
hot
and
throw
some
salt
on
them
to
overcome
the
sulphur
of
the
coal
and
then
directly
thrust
it
into
the
fresh
malt
or
goods
where
it
lies
till
all
the
water
is
laded
over
and
the
brewing
done
for
there
is
only
one
or
two
mashings
or
stirrings
at
most
necessary
in
a
brewing
others
that
brew
with
wood
will
quench
one
or
more
brands
ends
of
ash
in
a
copper
of
wort
to
mellow
the
drink
as
a
burnt
toast
of
bread
does
a
pot
of
beer
but
it
is
to
be
observed
that
this
must
not
be
done
with
oak
firr
or
any
other
wood
lest
it
does
more
harm
than
good
when
small
beer
is
not
wanted
and
another
brewing
is
soon
to
succeed
the
former
then
may
the
last
small
beer
wort
that
has
had
no
hops
boiled
in
it
remain
in
the
copper
all
night
which
will
prevent
its
foxing
and
be
ready
to
boil
instead
of
so
much
water
to
put
over
the
next
fresh
malt
this
will
greatly
contribute
to
the
strengthening
bettering
and
colouring
of
the
next
wort
and
is
commonly
used
in
this
manner
when
stout
or
beer
is
to
be
made
not
that
it
is
less
serviceable
if
it
was
for
ale
or
intire
guile
small
beer
but
lest
it
should
taste
of
the
copper
by
remaining
all
night
in
it
it
may
be
dispersed
into
tubs
and
kept
a
week
or
more
together
if
some
fresh
cold
water
is
daily
added
to
it
and
may
be
brewed
as
i
have
mentioned
taking
particular
care
in
this
as
well
as
in
the
former
ways
to
return
two
three
or
more
of
wort
into
the
mash
tub
that
first
of
all
runs
off
till
it
comes
absolutely
fine
and
clear
and
then
it
may
spend
away
or
run
off
for
good
others
will
reserve
this
small
beer
wort
unboiled
in
tubs
and
keep
it
there
a
week
in
winter
or
two
or
three
days
in
summer
according
to
conveniency
by
putting
fresh
water
every
day
to
it
and
use
it
instead
of
water
for
the
first
mash
alledging
it
is
better
so
than
boiled
because
by
that
it
is
thickened
and
will
cause
the
wort
to
run
foul
this
may
be
a
benefit
to
a
victualler
that
brews
to
sell
again
and
ca
vent
his
small
beer
because
for
such
small
raw
wort
that
is
mix
with
any
water
there
is
no
excise
to
be
pay
brewing
intire
guile
small
there
can
be
no
way
better
for
making
good
small
beer
than
by
brewing
it
from
fresh
malt
because
in
malt
as
well
as
in
hops
and
so
in
all
other
vegetables
there
is
a
spirituous
and
earthy
part
as
i
shall
further
enlarge
on
in
writing
of
the
hop
therefore
all
drink
brewed
from
goods
or
grains
after
the
first
or
second
worts
are
run
off
is
not
so
good
and
wholsome
as
that
intirely
brewed
from
fresh
malt
nor
could
any
thing
but
necessity
cause
me
to
make
use
of
such
liquor
yet
how
many
thousands
are
there
in
this
nation
that
know
nothing
of
the
matter
tho
it
is
of
no
small
importance
and
ought
to
be
regarded
by
all
those
that
value
their
health
and
taste
and
here
i
advertise
every
one
who
reads
or
hears
this
and
is
capable
of
being
his
own
friend
so
far
to
mind
this
and
prefer
that
small
beer
which
is
made
entirely
from
fresh
malt
before
any
other
that
is
brewed
after
strong
beer
or
ale
now
to
brew
such
guile
small
beer
after
the
boiling
water
has
stood
in
the
tub
till
it
is
clear
put
in
the
malt
leisurely
and
mash
it
that
it
does
not
ball
or
clot
then
throw
over
some
fresh
malt
on
the
top
and
cloths
over
that
and
let
it
stand
two
hours
before
it
is
drawn
off
the
next
water
may
be
between
hot
and
cold
the
next
boiling
hot
and
the
next
cold
or
if
conveniency
allows
not
there
may
be
once
scalding
water
and
all
the
rest
cold
instead
of
the
last
three
thus
i
brew
my
intire
guile
small
beer
by
putting
the
first
and
last
worts
together
allowing
half
or
a
pound
of
hops
to
a
hogshead
and
boiling
it
one
hour
but
if
the
hops
were
shifted
twice
in
that
time
the
drink
would
plainly
discover
the
benefit
sometimes
when
i
have
been
in
haste
for
small
beer
i
have
put
half
a
bushel
of
malt
and
a
few
hops
into
my
and
boil
a
kettle
gallop
as
some
call
it
an
hour
and
made
me
a
present
drink
till
i
had
more
leisure
to
brew
better
particular
way
of
brewing
october
there
was
a
man
in
this
country
that
brewed
for
a
gentleman
constantly
after
a
very
precise
method
and
that
was
as
soon
as
he
had
put
over
all
his
first
copper
of
water
and
mash
it
some
time
he
would
directly
let
the
cock
run
a
small
stream
and
presently
put
some
fresh
malt
on
the
former
and
mash
on
the
while
the
cock
was
spending
which
he
would
put
again
over
the
malt
as
often
as
his
pail
or
was
full
and
this
for
an
hour
or
two
together
then
he
would
let
it
run
off
intirely
and
put
it
over
at
once
to
run
off
again
as
small
as
a
straw
this
was
for
his
beer
then
he
would
put
scalding
water
over
the
goods
at
once
but
not
mash
and
cap
them
with
more
fresh
malt
that
stood
an
hour
undisturbed
before
he
would
draw
it
off
for
ale
the
rest
was
hot
water
put
over
the
goods
and
mash
at
twice
for
small
beer
and
it
was
observed
that
his
beer
was
the
most
famous
in
the
country
but
his
grains
good
for
little
for
that
he
had
by
this
method
wash
out
all
or
most
of
their
goodness
this
man
was
a
long
while
in
brewing
and
once
his
beer
did
not
work
in
the
barrel
for
a
month
in
a
very
hard
frost
yet
when
the
weather
broke
it
recovered
and
fermented
well
and
afterwards
proved
very
good
drink
but
he
seldom
work
his
beer
less
than
a
week
in
the
vat
and
was
never
tapp
under
three
years
this
way
indeed
is
attended
with
extraordinary
labour
and
time
by
the
brewers
running
off
the
wort
almost
continually
and
often
returning
the
same
again
into
the
mash
vat
but
then
it
certainly
gives
him
an
opportunity
of
extracting
and
washing
out
the
goodness
of
the
malt
more
than
any
of
the
common
methods
by
which
he
is
capacitated
to
make
his
or
beer
as
strong
as
he
pleases
the
fame
of
beer
is
at
this
time
well
known
not
only
throughout
but
several
other
remote
places
and
truly
not
without
desert
for
in
all
my
travels
i
never
met
with
any
that
excell
it
for
a
clear
amber
colour
a
fine
relish
and
a
light
warm
digestion
but
what
excell
all
was
the
generosity
of
its
donor
who
for
hospitality
in
his
viands
and
this
beer
has
left
but
few
of
his
fellows
i
remember
his
usual
expression
to
be
you
are
welcome
to
a
good
batch
of
my
and
true
it
was
that
he
proved
his
words
by
his
deeds
for
not
only
the
rich
but
even
the
poor
man
heart
was
generally
made
glad
even
in
advance
whenever
they
had
business
at
as
expecting
a
refreshment
of
this
cordial
malt
liquor
that
often
was
accompany
with
a
good
breakfast
or
dinner
besides
while
several
others
that
had
greater
estates
would
seem
generous
by
giving
a
yeoman
man
neighbour
the
mathematical
treat
of
a
look
on
the
spit
and
a
standing
drink
at
the
tap
brewing
molosses
molosses
or
treacle
has
certainly
been
formerly
made
too
much
use
of
in
the
brewing
of
stout
beer
common
butt
beers
brown
ales
and
small
beer
when
malts
have
been
dear
but
it
is
now
prohibited
under
the
penalty
of
fifty
pounds
for
every
ten
pounds
weight
found
in
any
common
brewhouse
and
as
malts
are
now
about
twenty
shillings
quarter
and
like
to
be
so
by
the
blessing
of
god
and
the
assistance
of
that
invaluable
excellent
liquor
for
steeping
seed
barley
in
published
in
a
late
book
intituled
and
vale
farming
there
is
no
great
danger
of
that
imposition
being
rife
again
which
in
my
opinion
was
very
unwholsome
because
the
brewer
was
obliged
to
put
such
a
large
quantity
of
treacle
into
his
water
or
small
wort
to
make
it
strong
beer
or
ale
as
very
probably
raised
a
sweating
in
some
degree
in
the
body
of
the
drinker
in
small
beer
a
lesser
quantity
will
serve
and
therefore
i
have
known
some
to
brew
it
in
that
for
their
health
sake
because
this
does
not
breed
the
scurvy
like
and
at
the
same
time
will
keep
open
the
pipes
and
passages
of
the
lungs
and
stomach
for
which
purpose
they
put
in
nine
pounds
weight
into
a
of
cold
water
first
mixing
it
well
and
boiling
it
briskly
with
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
hops
or
more
one
hour
so
that
it
may
come
off
twenty
seven
gallons
method
practiced
by
a
victualler
for
brewing
of
ale
october
nottingham
his
copper
holds
twenty
four
gallons
and
the
mash
tub
has
room
enough
for
four
and
more
bushels
of
malt
the
first
full
copper
of
boiling
water
he
puts
into
the
mash
tub
there
to
lye
a
quarter
of
an
hour
till
the
steam
is
so
far
spent
that
he
can
see
his
face
in
it
or
as
soon
as
the
hot
water
is
put
in
throws
a
pail
or
two
of
cold
water
into
it
which
will
bring
it
at
once
into
a
temper
then
he
lets
three
bushels
of
malt
be
run
leisurely
into
it
and
stirred
or
mash
all
the
while
but
as
little
as
can
be
or
no
more
than
just
to
keep
the
malt
from
clotting
or
balling
when
that
is
done
he
puts
one
bushel
of
dry
malt
on
the
top
to
keep
in
the
vapour
or
spirit
and
so
lets
it
stand
covered
two
hours
or
till
the
next
copper
full
of
water
is
boiled
hot
which
he
lades
over
the
malt
or
goods
three
full
at
a
time
that
are
to
run
off
at
the
cock
or
tap
by
a
very
small
stream
before
more
is
put
on
which
again
must
be
returned
into
the
mash
tub
till
it
comes
off
exceeding
fine
for
unless
the
wort
is
clear
when
it
goes
into
the
copper
there
are
little
hopes
it
will
be
so
in
the
barrel
which
leisure
way
obliges
him
to
be
sixteen
hours
in
brewing
these
four
bushels
of
malt
now
between
the
ladings
over
he
puts
cold
water
into
the
copper
to
be
boiling
hot
while
the
other
is
running
off
by
this
means
his
copper
is
kept
up
near
full
and
the
cock
spending
to
the
end
of
brewing
his
ale
or
small
beer
of
which
only
twenty
one
gallons
must
be
saved
of
the
first
wort
that
is
reserved
in
a
tub
wherein
four
ounces
of
hops
are
put
and
then
it
is
to
be
set
by
for
the
second
wort
i
will
suppose
there
are
twenty
gallons
of
water
in
the
copper
boiling
hot
that
must
be
all
laded
over
in
the
same
manner
as
the
former
was
but
no
cold
water
need
here
be
mixed
when
half
of
this
is
run
out
into
a
tub
it
must
be
directly
put
into
the
copper
with
half
of
the
first
wort
strain
thro
the
brewing
sieve
as
it
lies
on
a
small
loose
wooden
frame
over
the
copper
to
keep
back
those
hops
that
were
first
put
in
to
preserve
it
which
is
to
make
the
first
copper
twenty
one
gallons
then
upon
its
beginning
to
boil
he
puts
in
a
pound
of
hops
in
one
or
two
canvas
or
other
coarse
linnen
bags
somewhat
larger
than
will
just
contain
the
hops
that
an
allowance
may
be
given
for
their
swell
this
he
boils
away
very
briskly
for
half
an
hour
when
he
takes
the
hops
out
and
continues
boiling
the
wort
by
itself
till
it
breaks
into
particles
a
little
ragged
and
then
it
is
enough
and
must
be
dispers
into
the
cooling
tubs
very
thin
then
put
the
remainder
of
the
first
and
second
wort
together
and
boil
that
the
same
time
in
the
same
manner
and
with
the
same
quantity
of
fresh
hops
the
first
was
the
rest
of
the
third
or
small
beer
wort
will
be
about
fifteen
or
twenty
gallons
more
or
less
he
mixes
directly
with
some
cold
water
to
keep
it
free
of
excise
and
puts
it
into
the
copper
as
the
first
liquor
to
begin
a
second
brewing
of
ale
with
another
four
bushels
of
malt
as
he
did
before
and
so
on
for
several
days
together
if
necessary
but
at
last
there
may
be
some
small
beer
made
tho
some
will
make
make
none
because
the
goods
or
grains
will
go
the
further
in
feeding
of
hogs
on
the
foregoing
the
first
copper
of
twenty
four
gallons
of
water
is
but
sufficient
to
wet
three
bushels
of
malt
and
by
the
additions
of
cold
water
as
the
hot
is
expended
it
matters
not
how
much
the
malt
drinks
up
tho
a
third
part
of
water
is
generally
allowed
for
that
purpose
that
is
never
returned
by
the
leisure
putting
over
the
bowls
of
water
the
goodness
of
the
malt
is
the
more
extracted
and
washed
out
so
that
more
ale
may
be
this
way
made
and
less
small
beer
than
if
the
wort
was
drawed
out
hastily
besides
the
wort
has
a
greater
opportunity
of
coming
off
finer
by
a
slow
stream
than
by
a
quicker
one
which
makes
this
method
excel
all
others
that
discharge
the
wort
out
of
the
mash
tub
more
hastily
also
by
the
continual
running
of
the
cock
or
tap
the
goods
or
grains
are
out
of
danger
of
sowring
which
often
happens
in
summer
brewings
especially
when
the
cook
is
stopt
between
the
several
boilings
of
the
wort
and
what
has
been
the
very
cause
of
damaging
or
spoiling
many
guiles
of
drink
this
brewer
reposes
such
a
confidence
in
the
hops
to
preserve
the
wort
from
fixing
even
in
the
very
hottest
time
in
summer
that
he
puts
all
his
first
running
into
one
tub
till
he
has
an
opportunity
of
boiling
it
and
when
tubs
and
room
are
so
scarce
that
the
wort
is
obliged
to
be
laid
thick
to
cool
then
the
security
of
some
fresh
hops
and
not
them
already
boiled
or
soak
may
be
put
into
it
which
may
be
got
out
again
by
letting
the
drink
run
thro
the
cullender
and
after
that
a
hair
sieve
to
keep
the
seeds
of
the
hop
back
as
the
drink
goes
into
the
barrel
but
this
way
of
putting
hops
into
the
cooling
tubs
is
only
meant
where
there
is
a
perfect
necessity
and
tubs
and
room
enough
ca
be
had
to
lay
the
wort
thin
by
this
method
of
brewing
ale
may
be
made
as
strong
or
as
small
as
is
thought
fit
and
so
may
the
small
beer
that
comes
after
and
is
so
agreeable
that
this
brewer
makes
his
ale
and
strong
keeping
beer
all
one
and
the
same
way
only
with
this
difference
that
the
latter
is
stronger
and
more
hopp
than
the
former
where
little
or
no
small
beer
is
wanted
there
may
little
or
none
be
brewed
according
to
this
manner
of
working
which
is
no
small
conveniency
to
a
little
family
that
uses
more
strong
than
small
nor
is
there
any
loss
by
leaving
the
grainy
in
some
heart
where
horse
cows
hogs
or
rabbits
are
kept
i
am
very
sensible
that
the
vulgar
error
for
many
years
has
been
a
standard
sign
to
the
ignorant
of
boiling
strong
worts
only
till
they
break
or
curdle
in
the
copper
which
sometimes
will
be
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
or
in
an
hour
or
more
according
to
the
nature
of
the
malt
and
water
but
from
these
in
some
measure
i
dissent
and
also
from
those
that
boil
it
two
or
three
hours
for
it
is
certain
the
longer
worts
boil
the
thicker
they
are
made
because
the
watry
or
thin
parts
evaporate
first
away
and
the
thicker
any
drink
is
boiled
the
longer
it
requires
to
lye
in
the
barrel
to
have
its
particles
broke
which
age
must
be
then
the
sole
cause
of
and
therefore
i
have
fixed
the
time
and
sign
to
know
when
the
wort
is
truly
enough
and
that
in
such
a
manner
that
an
ordinary
capacity
may
be
a
true
judge
of
which
hereafter
will
prevent
prodigious
losses
in
the
waste
of
strong
worts
that
have
often
been
boiled
away
to
greater
loss
than
profit
i
have
here
also
made
known
i
think
the
true
method
of
managing
the
hop
in
the
copper
which
has
long
wanted
adjusting
to
prevent
the
great
damage
that
longer
boilings
of
them
has
been
the
sole
occasion
of
to
the
spoiling
of
most
of
our
malt
drinks
brewed
in
this
nation
chap
x
nature
and
use
of
the
this
vegetable
has
suffered
its
degradation
and
raised
its
reputation
on
the
most
of
any
other
it
formerly
being
thought
an
unwholsome
ingredient
and
till
of
late
a
great
breeder
of
the
stone
in
the
bladder
but
now
that
falacious
notion
is
obviated
by
and
others
who
have
proved
that
malt
drink
much
tinctured
by
the
hop
is
less
prone
to
do
that
mischief
than
ale
that
has
fewer
boiled
in
it
indeed
when
the
hop
in
a
dear
time
is
adulterated
with
water
in
which
aloes
etc
have
been
infused
as
was
practised
it
is
said
about
eight
years
ago
to
make
the
old
ones
recover
their
bitterness
and
seem
new
then
they
are
to
be
looked
on
as
unwholsome
but
the
pure
new
hop
is
surely
of
a
healthful
nature
composed
of
a
spirituous
flowery
part
and
a
phlegmatick
terrene
part
and
with
the
best
of
the
hops
i
can
either
make
or
mar
the
brewing
for
if
the
hops
are
boiled
in
strong
or
small
worts
beyond
their
fine
and
pure
nature
the
liquor
suffers
and
will
be
tang
with
a
noxious
taste
both
ungrateful
and
unwholsome
to
the
stomach
and
if
boiled
to
a
very
great
excess
they
will
be
apt
to
cause
reachings
and
disturb
a
weak
constitution
it
is
for
these
reasons
that
i
advise
the
boiling
two
parcels
of
fresh
hops
in
each
copper
of
and
if
there
were
three
for
keeping
beer
it
would
be
so
much
the
better
for
the
taste
health
of
body
and
longer
preservation
of
the
beer
in
a
sound
smooth
condition
and
according
to
this
one
of
my
neighbours
made
a
bag
like
a
of
the
ordinary
sixpenny
yard
cloth
and
boil
his
hops
in
it
half
an
hour
then
he
took
them
out
and
put
in
another
bag
of
the
like
quantity
of
fresh
hops
and
boiled
them
half
an
hour
more
by
which
means
he
had
an
opportunity
of
boiling
both
wort
and
hops
their
due
time
sav
himself
the
trouble
of
draining
them
thro
a
sieve
and
secured
the
seeds
of
the
hops
at
the
same
time
from
mixing
with
the
drink
afterwards
he
boiled
the
same
bags
in
his
small
beer
till
he
got
the
goodness
of
it
out
but
observe
that
the
bags
were
made
bigger
than
what
would
just
contain
the
hops
otherwise
it
will
be
difficult
to
boil
out
their
goodness
true
that
here
is
a
charge
encreased
by
the
consumption
of
a
greater
quantity
of
hops
than
usual
but
then
how
greatly
will
they
answer
the
desired
end
of
enjoying
fine
palated
wholsome
drink
that
in
a
cheap
time
will
not
amount
to
much
if
bought
at
the
best
hand
and
if
we
consider
their
and
benefit
in
small
beer
there
is
not
any
loss
at
all
in
their
quantity
but
where
it
can
be
afforded
the
very
small
beer
would
be
much
improved
if
fresh
hops
were
also
shifted
in
the
boiling
of
this
as
well
as
the
stronger
worts
and
then
it
would
be
neighbourly
charity
to
give
them
away
to
the
poorer
person
hence
may
appear
the
hardship
that
many
are
under
of
being
necessitated
to
drink
of
those
brewers
malt
liquors
who
out
of
avarice
boil
their
hops
to
the
last
that
they
may
not
lose
any
of
their
quintessence
nay
i
have
known
some
of
the
little
victualling
brewers
so
stupendiously
ignorant
that
they
have
thought
they
acted
the
good
husband
when
they
have
squeezed
the
hops
after
they
have
been
boiled
to
the
last
in
small
beer
to
get
out
all
their
goodness
as
they
vainly
imagin
which
is
so
reverse
to
good
management
that
in
my
opinion
they
had
much
better
put
some
sort
of
earth
into
the
drink
and
it
would
prove
more
pleasant
and
wholsome
and
why
the
small
beer
should
be
in
this
manner
as
i
may
justly
call
it
spoiled
for
want
of
the
trifling
charge
of
a
few
fresh
hops
i
am
a
little
surprized
at
since
is
the
most
general
liquor
of
families
and
therefore
as
great
care
is
due
to
as
any
in
its
brewing
to
enjoy
it
in
pure
and
wholsome
order
after
the
wort
is
cooled
and
put
into
the
working
vat
or
tub
some
have
thrown
fresh
hops
into
it
and
worked
them
with
the
yeast
at
the
same
time
reserving
a
few
gallons
of
raw
wort
to
wash
the
yeast
thro
a
sieve
to
keep
back
the
hop
this
is
a
good
way
when
hops
enough
have
not
been
sufficiently
boiled
in
the
wort
or
to
preserve
it
in
the
coolers
where
it
is
laid
thick
otherwise
i
think
it
needless
when
hops
have
been
dear
many
have
used
the
seeds
of
wormwood
the
they
buy
in
the
london
seed
shops
instead
of
them
others
or
wild
carrot
seed
that
grows
in
our
common
fields
which
many
of
the
poor
people
in
this
country
gather
and
dry
in
their
houses
against
their
wanting
of
them
others
that
wholsome
herb
which
indeed
is
a
fine
bitter
and
grows
on
several
of
our
commons
but
before
i
conclude
this
article
i
shall
take
notice
of
a
country
bite
as
i
have
already
done
of
a
one
and
that
is
of
an
arch
fellow
that
went
about
to
brew
for
people
and
took
his
opportunity
to
save
all
the
used
hops
that
were
to
be
thrown
away
these
he
washed
clean
then
would
dry
them
in
the
sun
or
by
the
fire
and
sprinkle
the
juice
of
on
them
which
would
give
them
such
a
greenish
colour
and
bitterish
taste
that
with
the
help
of
the
he
would
sell
them
for
new
hops
hops
in
themselves
are
known
to
be
a
subtil
grateful
bitter
whose
particles
are
active
and
rigid
by
which
the
viscid
ramous
parts
of
the
malt
are
much
divided
that
makes
the
drink
easy
of
digestion
in
the
body
they
also
keep
it
from
running
into
such
cohesions
as
would
make
it
ropy
valid
and
sour
and
therefore
are
not
only
of
great
use
in
boiled
but
in
raw
worts
to
preserve
them
sound
till
they
can
be
put
into
the
copper
and
afterwards
in
the
tun
while
the
drink
is
working
as
i
have
before
hinted
here
then
i
must
observe
that
the
worser
earthy
part
of
the
hop
is
greatly
the
cause
of
that
rough
harsh
unpleasant
taste
which
accompany
both
ales
and
beers
that
have
the
hops
so
long
boiled
in
them
as
to
tincture
their
worts
with
their
mischievous
effects
for
notwithstanding
the
malt
be
ever
so
good
the
hops
if
boiled
too
long
in
them
will
be
so
predominant
as
to
cause
a
nasty
bad
taste
and
therefore
i
am
in
hopes
our
malt
liquors
in
general
will
be
in
great
perfection
when
hops
are
made
use
of
according
to
my
directions
and
also
that
more
grounds
will
be
planted
with
this
most
serviceable
vegetable
than
ever
that
their
dearness
may
not
be
a
disencouragement
to
this
excellent
practice
for
i
know
an
and
brewer
who
to
save
the
expence
of
hops
that
were
then
two
shillings
pound
use
but
a
quartern
instead
of
a
pound
the
rest
he
supplied
with
seeds
but
to
be
more
particular
in
a
mug
of
this
person
ale
i
discovered
three
several
impositions
he
underboil
his
wort
to
save
its
consumption
he
boiled
this
seed
instead
of
the
hop
and
he
beat
the
yeast
in
for
some
time
to
encrease
the
strength
of
the
drink
and
all
these
in
such
a
manner
as
gull
and
infatuated
the
ignorant
drinker
to
such
a
degree
as
not
to
suspect
the
fraud
and
that
for
these
three
reasons
the
underboil
wort
being
of
a
more
sweet
taste
than
ordinary
was
esteemed
the
produce
of
a
great
allowance
of
malt
the
seed
encreased
their
approbation
by
the
fine
peach
flavour
or
relish
that
it
gives
the
drink
and
the
yeast
was
not
so
much
as
thought
of
since
they
enjoyed
a
strong
heady
liquor
these
artificial
qualities
and
i
think
i
may
say
unnatural
has
been
so
prevalent
with
the
vulgar
who
were
his
chief
customers
that
i
have
known
this
victualler
have
more
trade
for
such
drink
than
his
neighours
who
had
much
more
wholsome
at
the
same
time
for
the
seed
tho
it
is
a
carminative
and
has
some
other
good
properties
yet
in
the
unboil
wort
it
is
not
capable
of
doing
the
office
of
the
hop
in
breaking
thro
the
clammy
parts
of
it
the
hop
being
full
of
subtil
penetrating
qualities
a
strengthener
of
the
stomach
and
makes
the
drink
agreeble
by
opposing
obstructions
of
the
and
particularly
of
the
liver
and
kidneys
as
the
learned
maintain
which
confutes
the
old
notion
that
hops
are
a
breeder
of
the
stone
in
the
bladder
chap
xi
boiling
malt
altho
i
have
said
an
hour
and
a
half
is
requisite
for
boiling
beer
and
an
hour
for
ales
and
small
beer
yet
it
is
to
be
observed
that
an
exact
time
is
not
altogether
a
certain
rule
in
this
case
with
some
brewers
for
when
loose
hops
are
boiled
in
the
wort
so
long
till
they
all
sink
their
seeds
will
arise
and
fall
down
again
the
wort
also
will
be
curdled
and
broke
into
small
particles
if
examin
in
a
but
afterwards
into
larger
as
big
as
great
pins
heads
and
will
appear
clean
and
fine
at
the
top
this
is
so
much
a
rule
with
some
that
they
regard
not
time
but
this
sign
to
shew
when
the
wort
is
boiled
enough
and
this
will
happen
sooner
or
later
according
to
the
nature
of
the
barley
and
its
being
well
malted
for
if
it
comes
off
chalks
or
gravels
it
generally
has
the
good
property
of
breaking
or
curdling
soon
but
if
of
tough
clays
then
it
is
longer
which
by
some
persons
is
not
a
little
valued
because
it
saves
time
in
boiling
and
consequently
the
consumption
of
the
wort
it
is
also
to
be
observed
that
pale
malt
worts
will
not
break
so
soon
in
the
copper
as
the
brown
sorts
but
when
either
of
their
worts
boil
it
should
be
to
the
purpose
for
then
they
will
break
sooner
and
waste
less
than
if
they
are
kept
simmering
and
will
likewise
work
more
kindly
in
the
tun
drink
smoother
and
keep
longer
now
all
malt
worts
may
be
spoiled
by
too
little
or
too
much
boiling
if
too
little
then
the
drink
will
always
taste
raw
mawkish
and
be
unwholsome
in
the
stomach
where
instead
of
helping
to
dilute
and
digest
our
food
it
will
cause
obstructions
colicks
and
other
misfortunes
besides
all
such
underboil
drinks
are
certainly
exposed
to
staleness
and
sowerness
much
sooner
than
those
that
have
had
their
full
time
in
the
copper
and
if
they
are
boiled
too
long
they
will
then
thicken
for
one
may
boil
a
wort
to
a
salve
and
not
come
out
of
the
copper
fine
and
in
a
right
condition
which
will
cause
it
never
to
be
right
clear
in
the
barrel
an
sufficient
to
shew
the
mistake
of
all
those
that
think
to
excel
in
malt
liquors
by
boiling
them
two
or
three
hours
to
the
great
confusion
of
the
wort
and
doing
more
harm
than
good
to
the
drink
but
to
be
more
particular
in
those
two
extreams
it
is
my
opinion
as
i
have
said
before
that
no
ale
worts
boiled
less
than
an
hour
can
be
good
because
in
an
hour
time
they
can
not
acquire
a
thickness
of
body
any
ways
detrimental
to
them
and
in
less
than
an
hour
the
ramous
viscid
parts
of
the
ale
can
not
be
sufficiently
broke
and
divided
so
as
to
prevent
it
running
into
cohesions
ropyness
and
sowerness
because
in
ales
there
are
not
hops
enough
allowed
to
do
this
which
good
boiling
must
in
a
great
measure
supply
or
else
such
drink
i
am
sure
can
never
be
agreeable
to
the
body
of
man
for
then
its
cohesive
parts
being
not
thoroughly
broke
and
comminuted
by
time
and
boiling
remains
in
a
hard
texture
of
parts
which
consequently
obliges
the
stomach
to
work
more
than
ordinary
to
digest
and
secrete
such
parboiled
liquor
that
time
and
fire
should
have
cured
before
is
not
this
apparent
in
half
boil
meats
or
bread
that
often
causes
the
stomach
a
great
fatigue
to
digest
especially
in
those
of
a
sedentary
life
and
if
that
suffers
is
certain
the
whole
body
must
share
in
it
how
ignorant
then
are
those
people
who
in
tipling
of
such
liquor
can
praise
it
for
excellent
good
ale
as
i
have
been
an
of
and
only
because
its
taste
is
sweetish
which
is
the
nature
of
such
raw
drinks
as
believing
it
to
be
the
pure
effects
of
the
genuine
malt
not
perceiving
the
landlord
avarice
and
cunning
to
save
the
consumption
of
his
wort
by
shortness
of
boiling
tho
to
the
great
prejudice
of
the
drinker
health
and
because
a
liquid
does
not
afford
such
a
plain
ocular
demonstration
as
meat
and
bread
does
these
deluded
people
are
taken
into
an
approbation
of
indeed
an
or
what
is
not
to
come
then
to
the
of
the
matter
both
time
and
the
curdling
or
breaking
of
the
wort
should
be
consulted
for
if
a
person
was
to
boil
the
wort
an
hour
and
then
take
it
out
of
the
copper
before
it
was
rightly
broke
it
would
be
wrong
management
and
the
drink
would
not
be
fine
nor
wholsome
and
if
it
should
boil
an
hour
and
a
half
or
two
hours
without
regarding
when
its
particles
are
in
a
right
order
then
it
may
be
too
thick
so
that
due
care
must
be
had
to
the
two
extreams
to
obtain
it
its
due
order
therefore
in
and
keeping
beers
an
hour
and
a
quarter
good
boiling
is
commonly
sufficient
to
have
a
thorough
cured
drink
for
generally
in
that
time
it
will
break
and
boil
enough
and
because
in
this
there
is
a
double
security
by
length
of
boiling
and
a
quantity
of
hops
shifted
but
in
the
new
way
there
is
only
a
single
one
and
that
is
by
a
double
or
treble
allowance
of
fresh
hops
boiled
only
half
an
hour
in
the
wort
and
for
this
practice
a
reason
is
assigned
that
the
hops
being
endowed
with
discutient
apertive
qualities
will
by
them
and
their
great
quantity
supply
the
defect
of
underboiling
the
wort
and
that
a
further
conveniency
is
here
enjoyed
by
having
only
the
fine
wholsome
strong
flowery
spirituous
parts
of
the
hop
in
the
drink
exclusive
of
the
phlegmatick
nasty
earthy
parts
which
would
be
extracted
if
the
hops
were
to
be
boiled
above
half
an
hour
and
therefore
there
are
many
now
that
are
so
attach
to
this
new
method
that
they
wo
brew
ale
or
beer
any
other
way
vouching
it
to
be
a
true
tenet
that
if
hops
are
boiled
above
thirty
minutes
the
wort
will
have
some
or
more
of
their
worser
quality
the
allowance
of
hops
for
ale
or
beer
can
not
be
exactly
adjusted
without
coming
to
particulars
because
the
proportion
should
be
according
to
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
malt
the
season
of
the
year
it
is
brew
in
and
the
length
of
time
it
is
to
be
kept
for
strong
brown
ale
brew
in
any
of
the
winter
months
and
boiled
an
hour
one
pound
is
but
barely
sufficient
for
a
hogshead
if
it
be
in
three
weeks
or
a
month
if
for
pale
ale
brewed
at
that
time
and
for
that
age
one
pound
and
a
quarter
of
hops
but
if
these
ales
are
brewed
in
any
of
the
summer
months
there
should
be
more
hops
allowed
for
or
brown
beer
a
hogshead
made
from
eleven
bushels
of
malt
boiled
an
hour
and
a
quarter
to
be
kept
nine
months
three
pounds
and
a
half
ought
to
be
boiled
in
such
drink
at
the
least
for
or
pale
beer
made
from
fourteen
bushels
boiled
an
hour
and
a
quarter
and
kept
twelve
months
six
pound
ought
to
be
allowed
to
a
hogshead
of
such
drink
and
more
if
the
hops
are
shifted
in
two
bags
and
less
time
given
the
wort
to
boil
now
those
that
are
of
opinion
that
their
beer
and
ales
are
greatly
improved
by
boiling
the
hops
only
half
an
hour
in
the
wort
i
joyn
in
sentiment
with
them
as
being
very
sure
by
repeated
experience
it
is
so
but
i
must
here
take
leave
to
dissent
from
those
that
think
that
half
an
hour
boiling
the
wort
is
full
enough
for
making
right
sound
and
well
relished
malt
drinks
however
of
this
i
have
amply
and
more
particularly
wrote
in
my
second
book
of
brewing
in
chapter
iv
where
i
have
plainly
publish
the
true
sign
or
criterion
to
know
when
the
wort
is
boiled
just
enough
and
which
i
intend
to
publish
in
a
little
time
chap
xii
foxing
or
tainting
malt
foxing
is
a
misfortune
or
rather
a
disease
in
malt
drinks
occasioned
by
divers
means
as
the
nastiness
of
the
utensils
putting
the
worts
too
thick
together
in
the
backs
or
cooler
brewing
too
often
and
soon
one
after
another
and
sometimes
by
bad
malts
and
waters
and
the
liquors
taken
in
wrong
heats
being
of
such
pernicious
consequence
to
the
great
brewer
in
particular
that
he
sometimes
can
not
recover
and
bring
his
matters
into
a
right
order
again
under
a
week
or
two
and
is
so
hateful
to
him
in
its
very
name
that
it
is
a
general
law
among
them
to
make
all
servants
that
name
the
word
or
in
the
brewhouse
to
pay
sixpence
which
obliges
them
to
call
it
for
when
once
the
drink
is
tainted
it
may
be
smelt
at
some
distance
somewhat
like
a
it
chiefly
happens
in
hot
weather
and
causes
the
beer
and
ale
so
tainted
to
acquire
a
fulsome
sickish
taste
that
will
if
it
is
receive
in
a
great
degree
become
ropy
like
treacle
and
in
some
short
time
turn
sour
this
i
have
known
so
to
surprize
my
small
beer
customers
that
they
have
asked
the
drayman
what
was
the
matter
he
to
act
in
his
master
interest
tells
them
a
lye
and
says
it
is
the
goodness
of
the
malt
that
causes
that
sweetish
mawkish
taste
and
then
would
brag
at
home
how
cleverly
he
came
off
i
have
had
it
also
in
the
country
more
than
once
and
that
by
the
idleness
and
ignorance
of
my
servant
who
when
a
tub
has
been
rinced
out
only
with
fair
water
has
set
it
by
for
a
clean
one
but
this
wo
do
with
a
careful
master
for
i
oblige
him
to
clean
the
tub
with
a
ashes
or
sand
every
brewing
and
so
that
i
can
not
scrape
any
dirt
up
under
my
nail
however
as
the
cure
of
this
disease
has
baffled
the
efforts
of
many
i
have
been
tempted
to
endeavour
the
finding
out
a
remedy
for
the
great
malignity
and
shall
deliver
the
best
i
know
on
this
score
and
here
i
shall
mention
the
great
value
of
the
hop
in
preventing
and
curing
the
fox
in
malt
liquors
when
the
wort
is
run
into
the
tub
out
of
the
mashing
vat
it
is
a
very
good
way
to
throw
some
hops
directly
into
it
before
it
is
put
into
the
copper
and
they
will
secure
it
against
sourness
and
ropyness
that
are
the
two
effects
of
fox
worts
or
drinks
and
is
of
such
power
in
this
respect
that
raw
worts
may
be
kept
some
time
even
in
hot
weather
before
they
are
boiled
and
which
is
necessary
where
there
is
a
large
quantity
of
malt
used
to
a
little
copper
but
it
is
certain
that
the
stronger
worts
will
keep
longer
with
hops
than
the
smaller
sorts
so
likewise
if
a
person
has
fewer
tubs
than
is
wanting
and
he
is
apprehensive
his
worts
will
be
fox
by
too
thick
lying
in
the
coolers
or
working
tubs
then
it
will
be
a
safe
way
to
put
some
fresh
hops
into
such
tubs
and
work
them
with
the
yeast
as
i
have
before
hinted
or
in
case
the
drink
is
already
foxed
in
the
fat
or
tun
new
hops
should
be
put
in
and
work
with
it
and
they
will
greatly
fetch
it
again
into
a
right
order
but
then
such
drink
should
be
carefully
taken
clear
off
from
its
gross
nasty
lee
which
being
mostly
tainted
would
otherwise
lye
in
the
barrel
corrupt
and
make
it
worse
some
will
sift
quick
lime
into
foxed
drinks
while
they
are
working
in
the
tun
or
vat
that
its
fire
and
salts
may
break
the
cohesions
of
the
beer
or
ale
and
burn
away
the
stench
that
the
corruption
would
always
cause
but
then
such
drink
should
by
a
peg
at
the
bottom
of
the
vat
be
drawn
off
as
fine
as
possible
and
the
dregs
left
behind
there
are
many
that
do
not
conceive
how
their
drinks
become
fox
and
tainted
for
several
brewings
together
but
i
have
in
chapter
vi
in
my
second
book
made
it
appear
that
the
taint
is
chiefly
retain
and
lodged
in
the
upright
wooden
pins
that
fasten
the
planks
to
the
joists
and
how
scalding
lye
is
a
very
efficacious
liquor
to
extirpate
it
out
of
the
utensils
in
a
little
time
if
rightly
applied
and
one
other
most
powerful
ingredient
that
is
now
used
by
the
greatest
artists
for
curing
of
the
same
chap
xiii
fermenting
and
working
of
beers
and
ales
and
the
pernicious
practice
of
beating
in
the
yeast
this
subject
in
my
opinion
has
long
wanted
a
satyrical
pen
to
shew
the
ill
effects
of
this
unwholsome
method
which
i
suppose
has
been
much
discouraged
and
hindered
hitherto
from
the
general
use
it
has
been
under
many
years
especially
by
the
brewers
who
tho
much
famed
for
their
knowledge
in
this
art
and
have
induced
many
others
by
their
example
in
the
and
other
parts
to
pursue
their
method
yet
i
shall
endeavour
to
prove
them
culpable
of
that
beat
in
the
yeast
as
some
of
them
have
done
a
week
together
and
that
custom
ought
not
to
authorize
an
ill
practice
i
shall
observe
that
yeast
is
a
very
strong
acid
that
abounds
with
subtil
spirituous
qualities
whose
particles
being
wrapped
up
in
those
that
are
viscid
are
by
a
mixture
with
them
in
the
wort
brought
into
an
intestine
motion
occasion
by
particles
of
different
gravities
for
as
the
spirituous
parts
of
the
wort
will
be
continually
striving
to
get
up
to
the
surface
the
glutinous
adhesive
ones
of
the
yeast
will
be
as
constant
in
retarding
their
assent
and
so
prevent
their
escape
by
which
the
spirituous
particles
are
set
loose
and
free
from
their
viscid
confinements
as
may
appear
by
the
froth
on
the
top
and
to
this
end
a
moderate
warmth
hastens
the
operation
as
it
assists
in
opening
the
viscidities
in
which
some
spirituous
parts
may
be
entangled
and
unbends
the
spring
of
the
included
air
the
viscid
parts
which
are
raised
to
the
top
not
only
on
account
of
their
own
lightness
but
by
the
continual
efforts
and
occursions
of
the
spirits
to
get
uppermost
shew
when
the
ferment
is
at
the
highest
and
prevent
the
finer
spirits
making
their
escape
but
if
this
intestine
operation
is
permitted
to
continue
too
long
a
great
deal
will
get
away
and
the
remaining
grow
flat
and
vapid
as
well
observes
now
tho
a
small
quantity
of
yeast
is
necessary
to
break
the
band
of
corruption
in
the
wort
yet
it
is
in
itself
of
a
poisonous
nature
as
many
other
acids
are
for
if
a
plaister
of
thick
yeast
be
applied
to
the
wrist
as
some
have
done
for
an
ague
it
will
there
raise
little
pustules
or
blisters
in
some
degree
like
that
venomous
as
i
have
just
reason
in
a
particular
sense
to
call
it
ingredient
which
is
one
of
the
shop
poisons
here
then
i
shall
observe
that
i
have
known
several
beat
the
yeast
into
the
wort
for
a
week
or
more
together
to
improve
it
or
in
plainer
terms
to
load
the
wort
with
its
weighty
and
strong
spirituous
particles
and
that
for
two
reasons
because
it
will
make
the
liquor
so
heady
that
five
bushels
of
malt
may
be
equal
in
strength
to
six
and
that
by
the
stupifying
narcotick
qualities
of
the
yeast
which
mercenary
subtilty
and
imposition
has
so
prevailed
to
my
knowledge
with
the
vulgar
and
ignorant
that
it
has
caused
many
of
them
to
return
the
next
day
to
the
same
alehouse
as
believing
they
had
stronger
and
better
drink
than
others
but
alas
how
are
such
deceived
that
know
no
other
than
that
it
is
the
pure
product
of
the
malt
when
at
the
same
time
they
are
driving
nails
into
their
coffins
by
impregnating
their
blood
with
the
corrupt
qualities
of
this
poisonous
acid
as
many
of
its
drinkers
have
proved
by
suffering
violent
loss
of
appetite
and
other
inconveniencies
the
day
following
and
sometimes
longer
after
a
debauch
of
such
liquor
who
would
not
perhaps
for
a
great
reward
swallow
a
spoonful
of
thick
yeast
by
itself
and
yet
without
any
concern
may
receive
for
ought
they
know
several
dissolved
in
the
vehicle
of
ale
and
then
the
corrosive
corpuscles
of
the
yeast
being
mix
with
the
ale
can
not
fail
when
forsaken
in
the
canals
of
the
body
of
their
vehicle
to
do
the
same
mischief
as
they
would
if
taken
by
themselves
undiluted
only
with
this
difference
that
they
may
in
this
form
be
carried
sometimes
further
in
the
animal
frame
and
so
discover
their
malignity
in
some
of
the
inmost
recesses
thereof
which
also
is
the
very
case
of
malignant
waters
as
a
most
learned
doctor
observes
they
alledge
for
beating
the
yeast
into
wort
that
it
gives
it
a
fine
tang
or
relish
or
as
they
call
it
at
it
makes
the
ale
bite
of
the
yeast
but
this
flourish
indeed
is
for
no
other
reason
than
to
further
its
sale
and
tho
it
may
be
agreeable
to
some
bigots
to
me
it
proves
a
discovery
of
the
infection
by
its
nauseous
taste
however
my
surprize
is
lessen
when
i
remember
the
people
who
are
quite
the
reverse
of
them
at
and
for
the
first
are
so
attach
to
their
white
thick
ale
that
many
have
undone
themselves
by
drinking
it
nor
is
their
humour
much
different
as
to
the
common
brewers
brown
ale
who
when
the
customer
wants
a
hogshead
they
immediately
put
in
a
handful
of
salt
and
another
of
flower
and
so
bring
it
up
this
is
no
sooner
on
the
stilling
but
often
tapp
that
it
may
carry
a
froth
on
the
top
of
the
pot
otherwise
they
despise
it
the
salt
commonly
answered
its
end
of
causing
the
tiplers
to
become
dryer
by
the
great
quantities
they
drank
that
it
farther
excited
by
the
biting
pleasant
stimulating
quality
the
salt
strikes
the
palate
with
the
flower
also
had
its
seducing
share
by
pleasing
the
eye
and
mouth
with
its
mantling
froth
so
that
the
sailors
that
are
often
here
in
great
numbers
used
to
consume
many
hogsheads
of
this
common
ale
with
much
delight
as
thinking
it
was
intirely
the
pure
product
of
the
malt
their
white
ale
is
a
clear
wort
made
from
pale
malt
and
fermented
with
what
they
call
ripening
which
is
a
composition
they
say
of
the
flower
of
malt
yeast
and
whites
of
eggs
a
made
and
sold
only
by
two
or
three
in
those
parts
but
the
wort
is
brewed
and
the
ale
vended
by
many
of
the
publicans
which
is
drank
while
it
is
fermenting
in
earthen
steens
in
such
a
thick
manner
as
resembles
butter
ale
and
sold
for
twopence
halfpenny
the
full
quart
it
is
often
prescribed
by
physicians
to
be
drank
by
wet
nurses
for
the
encrease
of
their
milk
and
also
as
a
prevalent
medicine
for
the
colick
and
gravel
but
the
and
people
wo
drink
their
unless
it
is
aged
fine
and
strong
working
and
london
beer
and
in
my
brewhouse
at
the
yeast
at
once
was
put
into
the
tun
to
work
the
stout
beer
and
ale
with
as
not
having
the
conveniency
of
doing
otherwise
by
reason
the
of
small
beer
comes
into
the
same
backs
or
coolers
where
the
strong
worts
had
just
been
by
this
means
and
the
shortness
of
time
we
have
to
ferment
our
strong
drinks
we
can
not
make
reserves
of
cold
worts
to
mix
with
and
check
the
too
forward
working
of
those
liquors
for
there
we
brewed
three
times
a
week
throughout
the
year
as
most
of
the
great
ones
do
in
and
some
others
five
times
the
strong
beer
brewed
for
keeping
is
suffered
to
be
in
the
winter
when
the
yeast
is
put
into
it
that
it
may
gradually
work
two
nights
and
a
day
at
least
for
this
wo
admit
of
such
a
hasty
operation
as
the
common
brown
ale
will
because
if
it
is
work
too
warm
and
hasty
such
beer
wo
keep
near
so
long
as
that
fermented
cooler
the
brown
ale
has
indeed
its
yeast
put
into
it
in
the
evening
very
warm
because
they
carry
it
away
the
very
next
morning
early
to
their
customers
who
commonly
draw
it
out
in
less
than
a
week
time
the
pale
or
amber
ales
are
often
kept
near
it
not
quite
a
week
under
a
fermentation
for
the
better
incorporating
the
yeast
with
wort
by
beating
it
in
several
times
for
the
foregoing
reasons
working
or
fermenting
drinks
brewed
by
private
i
mean
such
who
brew
only
for
their
own
use
whether
it
be
a
private
family
or
a
victualler
in
this
case
be
it
for
stout
beers
or
for
any
of
the
ales
the
way
that
is
used
in
and
by
good
brewers
elsewhere
is
to
put
some
yeast
into
a
small
quantity
of
warm
wort
in
a
which
for
a
little
while
swims
on
the
top
where
it
works
out
and
leisurely
mixes
with
the
wort
that
is
first
quite
cold
in
summer
and
almost
so
in
winter
for
the
cooler
it
is
work
the
longer
it
will
keep
too
much
heat
agitating
the
spirituous
particles
into
too
quick
a
motion
whereby
they
spend
themselves
too
fast
or
fly
away
too
soon
and
then
the
drink
will
certainly
work
into
a
blister
head
that
is
never
natural
but
when
it
ferments
by
moderate
degrees
into
a
fine
white
curl
head
its
operation
is
then
truly
genuine
and
plainly
shews
the
right
management
of
the
brewer
to
one
hogshead
of
beer
that
is
to
be
kept
nine
months
i
put
a
quart
of
thick
yeast
and
ferment
it
as
cool
as
it
will
admit
of
two
days
together
in
or
and
if
i
find
it
works
too
fast
i
check
it
at
leisure
by
stirring
in
some
raw
wort
with
a
so
likewise
in
our
country
ales
we
take
the
very
same
method
because
of
having
them
keep
some
time
and
this
is
so
nicely
observed
by
several
that
i
have
seen
them
do
the
very
same
by
their
small
beer
wort
now
by
these
several
additions
of
raw
wort
there
are
as
often
new
commotions
raised
in
the
beer
or
ale
which
can
not
but
contribute
to
the
rarefaction
and
comminution
of
the
whole
but
whether
it
is
by
these
joining
principles
of
the
wort
and
yeast
that
the
drink
is
rendered
smoother
or
that
the
spirituous
parts
are
more
entangled
and
kept
from
making
their
escape
i
ca
determine
yet
sure
it
is
that
such
small
liquors
generally
sparkle
and
knit
out
of
the
barrel
as
others
out
of
a
bottle
and
is
as
pleasant
ale
as
ever
i
drank
others
again
for
butt
or
stout
beer
will
when
they
find
it
works
up
towards
a
thick
yeast
mix
it
once
and
beat
it
in
again
with
the
or
jett
and
when
it
has
work
up
a
second
time
in
such
a
manner
they
put
it
into
the
vessel
with
the
yeast
on
the
top
and
the
sediments
at
bottom
taking
particular
care
to
have
some
more
in
a
tub
near
the
cask
to
fill
it
up
as
it
works
over
and
when
it
has
done
working
leave
it
with
a
thick
head
of
yeast
on
to
preserve
it
but
for
ale
that
is
not
to
be
kept
very
long
they
hop
it
accordingly
and
beat
the
yeast
in
every
four
or
five
hours
for
two
days
successively
in
the
warm
weather
and
four
in
the
winter
till
the
yeast
begins
to
work
heavy
and
sticks
to
the
hollow
part
of
the
bowl
if
turned
down
on
the
same
then
they
take
all
the
yeast
off
at
top
and
leave
all
the
dregs
behind
putting
only
up
the
clear
drink
and
when
it
is
a
little
work
in
the
barrel
it
will
be
fine
in
a
few
days
and
ready
for
drinking
but
this
last
way
of
beating
in
the
yeast
too
long
i
think
i
have
sufficiently
detected
and
hope
as
it
is
how
declining
it
will
never
revive
again
and
for
which
reason
i
have
in
my
second
book
encouraged
all
light
fermentations
as
the
most
natural
for
the
malt
liquor
and
the
human
body
forwarding
and
retarding
the
fermentation
of
malt
in
case
beer
or
ale
is
backward
in
working
it
is
often
practised
to
cast
some
flower
out
of
the
dusting
box
or
with
the
hand
over
the
top
of
the
drink
which
will
become
a
sort
of
crust
or
cover
to
help
to
keep
the
cold
out
others
will
put
in
one
or
two
ounces
of
powder
ginger
which
will
so
heat
the
wort
as
to
bring
it
forward
others
will
take
a
gallon
stone
bottle
and
fill
it
with
boiling
water
which
being
well
cork
is
put
into
the
working
tub
where
it
will
communicate
a
gradual
heat
for
some
time
and
forward
the
fermentation
others
will
reserve
some
raw
wort
which
they
heat
and
mix
with
the
rest
but
then
due
care
must
be
taken
that
the
pot
in
which
it
is
heated
has
no
manner
of
grease
about
it
lest
it
impedes
instead
of
promoting
the
working
and
for
this
reason
some
nice
brewers
will
not
suffer
a
candle
too
near
the
wort
lest
it
drop
into
it
but
for
retarding
and
keeping
back
any
drink
that
is
too
much
heated
in
working
the
cold
raw
wort
as
i
have
said
before
is
the
most
proper
of
any
thing
to
check
it
with
tho
i
have
known
some
to
put
one
or
more
pewter
dishes
into
it
for
that
purpose
or
it
may
be
broke
into
several
other
tubs
where
by
its
shallow
lying
it
will
be
taken
off
its
fury
others
again
to
make
drink
work
that
is
backward
will
take
the
whites
of
two
eggs
and
beat
them
up
with
half
a
quartern
of
good
brandy
and
put
it
either
into
the
working
vat
or
into
the
cask
and
it
will
quickly
bring
it
forward
if
a
warm
cloth
is
put
over
the
bung
others
will
tye
up
bran
in
a
coarse
thin
cloth
and
put
it
into
the
vat
where
by
its
spungy
and
flowery
nature
and
close
bulk
it
will
absorp
a
quantity
of
the
drink
and
breed
a
heat
to
forward
its
working
i
know
an
of
a
great
town
in
that
is
so
curious
as
to
take
off
all
the
top
yeast
first
and
then
by
a
peg
near
the
bottom
of
his
working
tub
he
draws
off
the
beer
or
ale
so
that
the
dreggs
are
by
this
means
left
behind
this
i
must
own
is
very
right
in
ales
that
are
to
be
drank
soon
but
in
beers
that
are
to
lye
nine
or
twelve
months
in
a
butt
or
other
cask
there
certainly
will
be
wanted
some
feces
or
sediment
for
the
beer
to
feed
on
else
it
must
consequently
grow
hungry
sharp
and
eager
and
therefore
if
its
own
top
and
bottom
are
not
put
into
a
cask
with
the
beer
some
other
artificial
composition
or
lee
should
supply
its
place
that
is
wholsomer
and
will
better
feed
with
such
drink
than
its
own
natural
settlement
and
therefore
i
have
here
inserted
several
curious
receipts
for
answering
this
great
end
chap
xiv
an
artificial
lee
for
stout
or
stale
beer
to
feed
this
article
as
it
is
of
very
great
importance
in
the
curing
of
our
malt
liquors
requires
a
particular
regard
to
this
last
management
of
them
because
in
my
opinion
the
general
misfortune
of
the
butt
or
keeping
beers
drinking
so
hard
and
harsh
is
partly
owing
to
the
nasty
foul
feces
that
lye
at
the
bottom
of
the
cask
compounded
of
the
sediments
of
malt
hops
and
yeast
that
are
all
clogg
with
gross
rigid
salts
which
by
their
long
lying
in
the
butt
or
other
vessel
so
tinctures
the
beer
as
to
make
it
partake
of
all
their
raw
natures
for
such
is
the
feed
such
is
the
body
as
may
be
perceived
by
eels
taken
out
of
dirty
bottoms
that
are
sure
to
have
a
muddy
taste
when
the
silver
sort
that
are
catched
in
gravelly
or
sandy
clear
rivers
eat
sweet
and
fine
nor
can
this
ill
property
be
a
little
in
those
starting
as
they
call
it
in
new
thick
beers
that
were
carry
directly
from
my
brewhouse
and
by
a
leather
pipe
or
spout
conveyed
into
the
butt
as
they
stood
in
the
cellar
which
i
shall
further
demonstrate
by
the
example
of
whole
wheat
that
is
by
many
put
into
such
beer
to
feed
and
preserve
it
as
being
reckoned
a
substantial
alcali
however
it
has
been
proved
that
such
wheat
in
about
three
years
time
has
eat
into
the
very
wood
of
the
cask
and
there
it
by
making
little
hollow
cavities
in
the
staves
others
there
are
that
will
hang
a
bag
of
wheat
in
the
vessel
that
it
touch
the
bottom
but
in
both
cases
the
wheat
is
discovered
to
absorp
and
collect
the
saline
acid
qualities
of
the
beer
yeast
and
hop
by
which
it
is
impregnated
with
their
sharp
qualities
as
a
toast
of
bread
is
put
into
punch
or
beer
whose
alcalous
hollow
nature
will
attract
and
make
a
lodgment
of
the
acid
strong
particles
in
either
as
is
proved
by
eating
the
inebriating
toast
and
therefore
the
says
the
are
right
in
putting
a
toast
into
the
liquor
but
are
fools
for
eating
it
hence
it
is
that
such
whole
wheat
is
loaded
with
the
qualities
of
the
unwholsome
settlements
or
grounds
of
the
beer
and
becomes
of
such
a
corroding
nature
as
to
do
this
mischief
and
for
that
reason
some
in
the
will
hang
a
bag
of
the
flower
of
malted
oats
wheat
pease
and
beans
in
the
vessels
of
beer
as
being
a
lighter
and
mellower
body
than
whole
wheat
or
its
flower
and
more
natural
to
the
liquor
but
whether
it
be
raw
wheat
or
malted
it
is
supposed
after
this
receptacle
has
emitted
its
alcalous
properties
to
the
beer
and
taken
in
all
it
can
of
the
acid
qualities
thereof
that
such
beer
will
by
length
of
age
prey
upon
that
again
and
so
communicate
its
pernicious
effects
to
the
body
of
man
as
experience
seems
to
justify
by
the
many
sad
examples
that
i
have
seen
in
the
destruction
of
several
lusty
brewers
servants
who
formerly
what
they
then
called
flux
ale
to
the
preference
of
such
corroding
consuming
stale
beers
and
therefore
i
have
hereafter
advised
that
such
butt
or
keeping
beers
be
tapp
at
nine
or
twelve
months
end
at
furthest
and
then
an
artificial
lee
will
have
a
due
time
allowed
it
to
do
good
and
not
harm
excellent
composition
for
feeding
butts
or
keeping
beers
take
a
quart
of
brandy
or
as
much
of
that
is
free
from
any
burnt
tang
or
other
ill
taste
and
is
full
proof
to
this
put
as
much
wheat
or
flower
as
will
knead
it
into
a
dough
put
it
in
long
pieces
into
the
bung
hole
as
soon
as
the
beer
has
done
working
or
afterwards
and
let
it
gently
fall
piece
by
piece
to
the
bottom
of
the
butt
this
will
maintain
the
drink
in
a
mellow
freshness
keep
staleness
off
for
some
time
and
cause
it
to
be
the
stronger
as
it
grows
aged
another
take
one
pound
of
treacle
or
honey
one
pound
of
the
powder
of
dryed
or
fat
chalk
mix
them
well
and
put
it
into
a
butt
as
soon
as
it
has
done
working
or
some
time
after
and
bung
it
well
this
will
both
fine
and
preserve
the
beer
in
a
soft
smooth
condition
for
a
great
while
another
take
a
peck
of
and
dry
them
in
an
oven
break
and
mix
them
with
two
pound
of
fat
chalk
and
mix
them
with
water
wherein
four
pounds
of
coarse
sugar
has
been
boiled
and
put
it
into
the
butt
as
aforesaid
fine
and
preserve
beers
and
ales
by
boiling
an
ingredient
in
the
this
most
valuable
way
i
frequently
follow
both
for
ale
and
small
beer
and
that
is
in
each
barrel
copper
of
wort
i
put
in
a
pottle
or
two
quarts
of
whole
wheat
as
soon
as
i
can
that
it
may
soak
before
it
boils
then
i
strain
it
thro
a
sieve
when
i
put
the
wort
in
cooling
tubs
and
if
it
is
thought
fit
the
same
wheat
may
be
boiled
in
a
second
copper
thus
there
will
be
extracted
a
gluey
consistence
which
being
incorporated
with
the
wort
by
boiling
gives
it
a
more
thick
and
ponderous
body
and
when
in
the
cask
soon
makes
a
sediment
or
lee
as
the
wort
is
more
or
less
loaded
with
the
weighty
particles
of
this
fizy
body
but
if
such
wheat
was
first
parched
or
baked
in
an
oven
it
would
do
better
as
being
rather
too
raw
as
it
comes
from
the
ear
a
woman
who
lived
at
in
and
had
the
best
ale
in
the
town
once
told
a
gentleman
she
had
drink
just
done
working
in
the
barrel
and
before
it
was
bung
would
wager
it
was
fine
enough
to
drink
out
of
a
glass
in
which
it
should
maintain
a
little
while
a
high
froth
and
it
was
true
for
the
ivory
shavings
that
she
boiled
in
her
wort
was
the
cause
of
it
which
an
acquaintance
of
mine
accidentally
had
a
view
of
as
they
lay
spread
over
the
wort
in
the
copper
so
will
hartshorn
shavings
do
the
same
and
better
both
of
them
being
great
finers
and
preservers
of
malt
liquors
against
staleness
and
sourness
and
are
certainly
of
a
very
alcalous
nature
or
if
they
are
put
into
a
cask
when
you
bung
it
down
it
will
be
of
service
for
that
purpose
but
these
are
dear
in
comparison
of
the
whole
wheat
which
will
in
a
great
measure
supply
their
place
and
after
it
is
used
may
be
given
to
a
poor
body
or
to
the
hog
stop
the
fret
in
malt
take
a
quart
of
black
cherry
brandy
and
pour
it
in
at
the
of
the
hogshead
and
stop
it
close
recover
deadish
when
strong
drink
grows
flat
by
the
loss
of
its
spirits
take
four
or
five
gallons
out
of
a
hogshead
and
boil
it
with
five
pound
of
honey
skim
it
and
when
cold
put
it
to
the
rest
and
stop
it
up
close
this
will
make
it
pleasant
quick
and
strong
make

drink
take
the

stamp

and
strain
it
then
put
a
spoonful
of
the
juice
which
is
an
extream
good
pectoral
to
a
of
beer
let
it
stand
covered
about
two
hours
and
drink
it
fine

take
a
pint
of

half
an
ounce
of

mix

well
together
let

and
the

the

pour

and
put
it
into

and
boiled
and
in

there
are
several
other
compositions
that
may
be
used
for
this
purpose
but
none

most
excellent

great

preservers

several
pernicious
ingredients
put
into
malt
liquors
to
encrease
their
malt
liquors
as
well
as
several
others
have
long
lain
under
the
disreputation
of
being
adulterated
and
greatly
abused
by
avaricious
and
people
to
augment
their
profits
at
the
expence
of
the
precious
health
of
human
bodies
which
tho
the
greatest
jewel
in
life
is
said
to
be
too
often
lost
by
the
deceit
of
the
brewer
and
the
intemperance
of
the
drinker
this
undoubtedly
was
one
and
i
believe
the
greatest
of
the
lord
reasons
for
saying
he
thought
not
one
in
a
thousand
died
a
natural
death
nor
is
it
indeed
to
be
much
wondered
at
when
according
to
report
several
of
the
publicans
make
it
their
business
to
study
and
practise
this
art
witness
what
i
am
afraid
is
too
true
that
some
have
made
use
of
the
berry
for
making
drink
heady
and
saving
the
expence
of
malt
but
as
this
is
a
violent
potion
by
its
narcotick
stupifying
quality
if
taken
in
too
large
a
degree
i
hope
this
will
be
rather
a
prevention
of
its
use
than
an
invitation
it
being
so
much
of
the
nature
of
the
deadly
nightshade
that
it
bears
the
same
character
and
i
am
sure
the
latter
is
bad
enough
for
one
of
my
neighbour
brothers
was
killed
by
eating
its
berries
that
grow
in
some
of
our
hedges
and
so
neatly
resembles
the
black
cherry
that
the
boy
took
the
wrong
for
the
right
there
is
another
sinister
practice
said
to
be
frequently
used
by
ill
persons
to
supply
the
full
quantity
of
malt
and
that
is
seeds
this
also
is
of
a
heady
nature
boiled
in
the
wort
one
pound
of
which
will
answer
to
a
bushel
of
malt
as
was
ingenuously
confess
to
me
by
a
gardener
who
own
he
sold
a
great
deal
of
it
to
alehouse
brewers
for
i
do
suppose
the
great
brewer
would
be
concern
in
any
such
affair
for
that
purpose
purpose
at
per
pound
but
how
wretchedly
ignorant
are
those
that
make
use
of
it
not
knowing
the
way
first
to
cure
and
prepare
it
for
this
and
other
mixtures
without
which
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
and
will
cause
sickness
in
the
drinkers
of
it
others
are
said
to
make
use
of
to
fine
and
preserve
the
drink
but
to
come
off
the
fairest
in
such
foul
artifices
it
has
been
too
much
a
general
practice
to
beat
the
yeast
so
long
into
the
ale
that
without
doubt
it
has
done
great
prejudice
to
the
healths
of
many
others
besides
the
person
i
have
writ
of
in
the
preface
of
my
second
book
for
the
sake
then
of
seller
and
buyer
i
have
here
offered
several
valuable
receipts
for
fining
preserving
and
mellowing
beers
and
ales
in
such
a
true
healthful
and
beneficial
manner
that
from
henceforth
after
the
perusal
of
this
book
and
the
knowledge
of
their
worth
are
fully
known
no
person
i
hope
will
be
so
sordidly
obstinate
as
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
such
unwholsome
ingredients
because
these
are
not
only
of
the
cheapest
sort
but
will
answer
their
end
and
purpose
and
the
rather
since
malts
are
now
only
twenty
shillings
per
quarter
and
like
to
hold
a
low
price
for
reasons
that
i
could
here
assign
i
own
i
formerly
thought
they
were
too
valuable
to
expose
to
the
publick
by
reason
of
their
cheapness
and
great
virtues
as
being
most
of
them
wholsomer
than
the
malt
itself
which
is
but
a
corrupted
grain
but
as
i
hope
they
will
do
considerable
service
in
the
world

having

the
cellar
or
repository
for
keeping
beers
and
it
certain
by
long
experience
that
the
weather
or
air
has
not
only
a
power
or
influence
in
brewings
but
also
after
the
drink
is
in
the
barrel
hogshead
or
butt
in
cellars
or
other
places
which
is
often
the
cause
of
forwarding
or
retarding
the
fineness
of
malt
liquors
for
if
we
brew
in
cold
weather
and
the
drink
is
to
stand
in
a
cellar
of
clay
or
where
springs
rise
or
waters
lye
or
pass
through
such
a
place
by
consequence
will
check
the
due
working
of
the
drink
chill
flat
deaden
and
hinder
it
from
becoming
fine
so
likewise
if
beer
or
ale
is
brewed
in
hot
weather
and
put
into
chalky
gravelly
or
sandy
cellars
and
especially
if
the
windows
open
to
the
south
or
then
it
is
very
likely
it
will
not
keep
long
but
be
muddy
and
stale
therefore
to
keep
beer
in
such
a
cellar
it
should
be
brewed
in
that
the
drink
may
have
time
to
cure
itself
before
the
hot
weather
comes
on
but
in
wettish
or
damp
cellars
is
best
to
brew
in
that
the
drink
may
have
time
to
fine
and
settle
before
the
winter
weather
is
advanced
now
such
cellar
extremities
should
if
it
could
be
done
be
brought
into
a
temperate
state
for
which
purpose
some
have
been
so
curious
as
to
have
double
or
treble
doors
to
their
cellar
to
keep
the
air
out
and
then
carefully
shut
the
outward
before
they
enter
the
inward
one
whereby
it
will
be
more
secure
from
aerial
alterations
for
in
cellars
and
places
that
are
most
exposed
to
such
seasons
malt
liquors
are
frequently
disturb
and
made
unfit
for
a
nice
drinker
therefore
if
a
cellar
is
kept
dry
and
these
doors
to
it
it
is
reckoned
warm
in
winter
and
cool
in
summer
but
the
best
of
cellars
are
thought
to
be
those
in
chalks
gravels
or
sands
and
particularly
in
chalks
which
are
of
a
drying
quality
more
than
any
other
and
consequently
dissipates
damps
the
most
of
all
earths
which
makes
it
contribute
much
to
the
good
keeping
of
the
drink
for
all
damp
cellars
are
prejudicial
to
the
preservation
of
beers
and
ales
and
sooner
bring
on
the
rotting
of
the
casks
and
hoops
than
the
dry
ones
insomuch
that
in
a
chalky
cellar
near
me
their
ashen
broad
hoops
have
lasted
above
thirty
years
besides
in
such
inclosed
cellars
and
temperate
air
the
beers
and
ales
ripen
more
kindly
are
better
digested
and
softned
and
drink
smoother
but
when
the
air
is
in
a
disproportion
by
the
cellars
letting
in
heats
and
colds
the
drink
will
grow
stale
and
be
disturbed
sooner
than
when
the
air
is
kept
out
from
hence
it
is
that
in
some
places
their
malt
liquors
are
exceeding
good
because
they
brew
with
pale
or
amber
malts
chalky
water
and
keep
their
drinks
in
close
vaults
or
proper
dry
cellars
which
is
of
such
importance
that
notwithstanding
any
malt
liquor
may
be
truly
brewed
yet
it
may
be
spoiled
in
a
bad
cellar
that
may
cause
such
alternate
fermentations
as
to
make
it
thick
and
sour
tho
it
sometimes
happens
that
after
such
changes
it
fines
itself
again
and
to
prevent
these
commotions
of
the
beer
some
brew
their
pale
malt
in
and
their
brown
in
for
that
the
pale
malt
having
not
so
many
fiery
particles
in
it
as
the
brown
stands
more
in
need
of
the
summer
weather
to
ripen
it
while
the
brown
sort
being
more
hard
and
dry
is
better
able
to
defend
itself
against
the
winter
colds
that
will
help
to
smooth
its
harsh
particles
yet
when
they
happen
to
be
too
violent
should
be
laid
to
the
windows
as
a
fortification
against
them
but
if
there
were
no
lights
at
all
to
a
cellar
it
would
be
better
some
are
of
opinion
that
is
the
best
of
all
other
months
to
brew
any
sort
of
malt
in
by
reason
there
are
so
many
cold
months
directly
follow
that
will
digest
the
drink
and
make
it
much
excel
that
brewed
in
because
such
beer
will
not
want
that
care
and
watching
as
that
brewed
in
absolutely
requires
by
often
taking
out
and
putting
in
the
on
change
of
weather
and
if
it
is
always
left
out
then
it
deadens
and
palls
the
drink
yet
if
due
care
is
not
taken
in
this
respect
a
thunder
or
stormy
night
may
marr
all
by
making
the
drink
ferment
and
burst
the
cask
for
which
reason
as
iron
hoops
are
most
in
fashion
at
this
time
they
are
certainly
the
greatest
security
to
the
safety
of
the
drink
thus
exposed
and
next
to
them
is
the
chesnut
hoop
both
which
will
endure
a
shorter
or
longer
time
as
the
cellar
is
more
or
less
dry
and
the
management
attending
them
the
iron
hoop
generally
begins
to
rust
first
at
the
edges
and
therefore
should
be
rubbed
off
when
opportunity
offers
and
be
both
kept
from
wet
as
much
as
possible
for
is
rust
that
eats
the
iron
hoop
in
two
sometimes
in
ten
or
twelve
years
when
the
ashen
and
chesnut
in
dry
cellars
have
lasted
three
times

cleaning
and
sweetening
of
in
case
your
cask
is
a
butt
then
with
cold
water
first
rince
out
the
lees
clean
and
have
ready
boiling
or
very
hot
water
which
put
in
and
with
a
long
stale
and
a
little
birch
fastened
to
its
end
scrub
the
bottom
as
well
as
you
can
at
the
same
time
let
there
be
provided
another
shorter
broom
of
about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
that
with
one
hand
may
be
so
imployed
in
the
upper
and
other
parts
as
to
clean
the
cask
well
so
in
a
hogshead
or
other
smaller
vessel
the
short
broom
may
be
used
with
water
or
with
water
sand
or
ashes
and
be
effectually
cleaned
the
outside
of
the
cask
about
the
should
be
well
washed
lest
the
yeast
as
it
works
over
carries
some
of
its
filth
with
it
but
to
sweeten
a
barrel
kilderkin
firkin
or
pin
in
the
great
brewhouses
they
put
them
over
the
copper
hole
for
a
night
together
that
the
steam
of
the
boiling
water
or
wort
may
penetrate
into
the
wood
this
way
is
such
a
furious
searcher
that
unless
the
cask
is
new
hooped
just
before
it
will
be
apt
to
fall
in
pieces
take
a
pottle
or
more
of
stone
lime
and
put
it
into
the
cask
on
this
pour
some
water
and
stop
it
up
directly
shaking
it
well

take
a
long
linnen
rag
and
dip
it
in
melted
brimstone

it
at
the
end
and
let
it
hang
pendant
with
the
upper
part
of
the
rag
fastened
to
the
wooden
bung
this
is
a
most
quick
sure
way
and
will
not
only
sweeten
but
help
to
fine
the
drink
or
to
make
your
cask
more
pleasant
you
may
use
the
vintners
way
thus
take
four
ounces
of
stone
brimstone
one
ounce
of
burnt
alum
and
two
ounces
of
brandy
melt
all
these
in
an
earthen
pan
over
hot
coals
and
dip
therein
a
piece
of
new
canvas
and
instantly
sprinkle
thereon
the
powders
of
nutmegs
cloves
coriander
and
this
canvas
set
on
fire
and
let
it
burn
hanging
in
the
cask
fastened
at
the
end
with
the
wooden
bung
so
that
no
smoke
comes
out
a
musty
boil
some
pepper
in
water
and
fill
the
cask
with
it
scalding
hot
a
very
stinking
the
last
remedy
is
the
coopers
taking
out
one
of
the
heads
of
the
cask
to
scrape
the
inside
or
the
staves
and
is
the
surest
way
of
all
others
if
it
is
fired
afterwards
a
small
matter
as
the
cooper
knows
how
these
several
methods
may
be
made
use
of
at
discretion
and
will
be
of
great
service
where
they
are
wanted
the
sooner
also
a
remedy
is
applied
the
better
else
the
taint
commonly
encreases
as
many
have
to
their
prejudice
proved
who
have
made
use
of
such
casks
in
hopes
the
next
beer
will
overcome
it
but
when
once
a
cask
is
infected
it
will
be
a
long
while
if
ever
before
it
becomes
sweet
if
no
art
is
used
many
therefore
of
the
careful
sort
in
case
they
ha
a
convenience
to
fill
their
vessel
as
soon
as
it
is
empty
will
stop
it
close
to
prevent
the

and
preserve
the

will

tend
to
the
keeping
of
the
cask
pure
and
sweet
against
the
next
occasion
prepare
a
new
vessel
to
keep
malt
liquors
a
new
vessel
is
most
improperly
used
by
some
ignorant
people
for
strong
drink
after
only
once
or
twice
scalding
with
water
which
is
so
wrong
that
such
beer
or
ale
will
not
fail
of
tasting
thereof
for
half
if
not
a
whole
year
afterwards
such
is
the
tang
of
the
oak
and
its
bark
as
may
be
observed
from
the
strong
scents
of
which
the
bark
is
one
cause
of
to
prevent
then
this
inconvenience
when
your
brewing
is
over
put
up
some
water
scalding
hot
and
let
it
run
throu
the
grains
then
boil
it
and
fill
up
the
cask
stop
it
well
and
let
it
stand
till
it
is
cold
do
this
twice
then
take
the
grounds
of
strong
drink
and
boil
in
it
green
wallnut
leaves
and
new
hay
or
wheat
straw
and
put
all
into
the
cask
that
it
be
full
and
stop
it
close
after
this
use
it
for
small
beer
half
a
year
together
and
then
it
will
be
thoroughly
sweet
and
fit
for
strong
drinks
or
take
a
new
cask
and
dig
a
hole
in
the
ground
in
which
it
may
lye
half
depth
with
the
bung
downwards
let
it
remain
a
week
and
it
will
greatly
help
this
or
any
stinking
musty
cask
but
besides
these
i
have
writ
of
two
other
excellent
ways
to
sweeten
musty
or
stinking
casks
in
my
second
book
of
brewing
these
in
my
opinion
are
the
cheapest
of
all
others
to
furnish
a
person
readily
with
as
being
many
of
them
good
casks
for
malt
liquors
because
the
sack
and
sorts
are
already
season
to
hand
and
will
greatly
improve
beers
and
ales
that
are
put
in
them
but
beware
of
the
rhenish
wine
cask
for
strong
drinks
for
its
wood
is
so
tinctured
with
this
sharp
wine
that
it
will
hardly
ever
be
free
of
it
and
therefore
such
cask
is
best
used
for
small
beer
the
claret
cask
will
a
great
deal
sooner
be
brought
into
a
serviceable
state
for
holding
strong
drink
if
it
is
two
or
three
times
scalded
with
grounds
of
barrels
and
afterwards
used
for
small
beer
for
some
time
i
have
bought
a
butt
or
pipe
for
eight
shillings
in
with
some
iron
hoops
on
it
a
good
hogshead
for
the
same
and
the
half
hogshead
for
five
shillings
the
carriage
for
a
butt
by
the
waggon
thirty
miles
is
two
shillings
and
sixpence
and
the
hogshead
but
to
cure
a
claret
cask
of
its
colour
and
taste
put
a
peck
of
into
a
hogshead
and
pour
upon
it
three
pails
of
water
bung
immediately
with
a
cork
bung
and
shake
it
well
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
let
it
stand
a
day
and
night
and
it
will
bring
off
the
red
colour
and
alter
the
taste
of
the
cask
very
much
but
of
three
several
other
excellent
methods
for
curing
musty
stinking
new
and
other
tainted
casks
i
have
writ
of
in
my
account
of
casks
in
my
second
book
chap
xviii
bunging
casks
and
carrying
of
malt
liquors
to
some
i
am
sure
this
is
of
no
small
consequence
however
it
may
be
esteemed
as
a
light
matter
by
some
for
if
this
is
not
duly
perform
all
our
charge
labour
and
care
will
be
lost
and
therefore
here
i
shall
dissent
from
my
fashion
where
i
bung
up
my
ale
with
pots
of
clay
only
or
with
clay
mix
with
bay
salt
which
is
the
better
of
the
two
because
this
salt
will
keep
the
clay
moist
longer
than
in
its
original
state
and
the
butt
beers
and
fine
ales
were
bung
with
cork
drove
in
with
a
piece
of
or
rag
which
i
think
are
all
insipid
and
the
occasion
of
spoiling
great
quantities
of
drink
especially
the
small
beers
for
when
the
clay
is
dry
which
is
soon
in
summer
there
can
not
be
a
regular
vent
thro
it
and
then
the
drink
from
that
time
flattens
and
stales
to
the
great
loss
in
a
year
to
some
owners
and
the
benefit
of
the
brewer
for
then
a
fresh
cask
must
be
tapp
to
supply
it
and
the
remaining
part
of
the
other
throw
away
now
to
prevent
this
great
inconvenience
my
are
not
quite
of
the
largest
size
of
all
and
yet
big
enough
for
the
common
wooden
iron
hoop
funnel
used
in
some
in
this
i
put
in
a
turned
piece
of
ash
or
sallow
three
inches
broad
at
top
and
two
inches
and
a
half
long
first
putting
in
a
double
piece
of
dry
brown
paper
that
is
so
broad
that
an
inch
or
more
may
be
out
of
it
after
the
wooden
bung
is
drove
down
with
a
hammer
pretty
tight
this
paper
must
be
furl
or
twisted
round
the
bung
and
another
loose
piece
upon
and
around
that
with
a
little
yeast
and
a
small
peg
put
into
the
bung
which
is
to
be
raised
at
discretion
when
the
beer
is
drawing
or
at
other
times
to
give
it
vent
if
there
should
be
occasion
others
will
put
some
coal
or
wood
ashes
wetted
round
this
bung
which
will
bind
very
hard
and
prevent
any
air
getting
into
or
out
of
the
cask
but
this
in
time
is
apt
to
rot
and
wear
the
by
the
salt
or
sulphur
in
the
ashes
and
employing
a
knife
to
scrape
it
afterwards
yet
for
keeping
beers
it
the
best
security
of
all
other
ways
whatsoever
there
is
also
a
late
invention
practised
by
a
common
brewer
in
the
country
that
i
am
acquainted
with
for
the
safe
carriage
of
drink
on
drays
to
some
distance
without
losing
any
of
it
and
that
is
in
the
top
center
of
one
of
these
bungs
he
puts
in
a
wooden
funnel
whose
spout
is
about
four
inches
long
and
less
than
half
an
inch
diameter
at
bottom
this
is
turned
at
top
into
a
concave
fashion
like
a
hollow
round
bowl
that
will
hold
about
a
pint
which
is
a
constant
vent
to
the
cask
and
yet
hinders
the
liquor
from
ascending
no
faster
than
the
bowl
can
receive
and
return
it
again
into
the
barrel
i
may
say
further
he
has
brought
a
barrel
two
miles
and
it
was
then
full
when
it
arrived
at
his
customers
because
the
pint
that
was
put
into
the
funnel
at
setting
out
was
not
at
all
lost
when
he
took
it
off
the
dray
this
may
be
also
made
of
tin
and
will
serve
from
the
butt
to
the
small
cask
in
the
butt
there
is
a
made
about
two
inches
below
the
upper
head
and
close
under
that
a
piece
of
leather
is
nailed
that
jetts
three
inches
out
from
which
the
yeast
works
and
falls
into
a
tub
and
when
the
working
is
over
the
cork
is
put
closely
in
for
the
bung
in
the
head
of
the
upright
cask
is
put
in
as
soon
as
it
is
filled
up
with
new
drink
now
when
such
a
cask
is
to
be
broach
and
a
quick
draught
is
to
follow
then
it
may
be
tapp
at
bottom
but
if
otherwise
the
brass
cock
ought
to
be
first
put
in
at
the
middle
and
before
the
drink
sinks
to
that
it
should
be
tapp
at
bottom
to
prevent
the
breaking
of
the
head
of
yeast
and
its
growing
stale
flat
and
sour
in
some
places
in
the
country
when
they
brew
ale
or
beer
to
send
to
at
a
great
distance
they
let
it
be
a
year
old
before
they
tap
it
so
that
then
it
is
perfectly
fine
this
they
put
into
small
casks
that
have
a
only
fit
for
a
large
cork
and
then
they
immediately
put
in
a
role
of
first
kneaded
with
water
or
drink
and
baked
in
an
oven
which
is
all
secured
by
pitching
in
the
cork
and
so
sent
in
the
waggon
the
feeding
and
preserving
the
body
of
the
drink
all
the
way
without
fretting
or
causing
it
to
burst
the
cask
for
want
of
vent
and
when
tapp
will
also
make
the
drink
very
brisk
because
the
flour
is
in
such
a
hard
consistence
that
it
wo
dissolve
in
that
time
but
if
a
little
does
mix
with
the
ale
or
beer
its
heavy
parts
will
sooner
fine
than
thicken
the
drink
and
keep
it
mellow
and
lively
to
the
last
if
air
is
kept
out
of
the
barrel
chap
xix
the
strength
and
age
of
malt
whether
they
be
ales
or
strong
beers
it
is
certain
that
the
midling
sort
is
allowed
by
physicians
to
be
the
most
agreeable
of
any
especially
to
those
of
a
sedentary
life
or
those
that
are
not
occupied
in
such
business
as
promotes
perspiration
enough
to
throw
out
and
break
the
viscidities
of
the
stronger
sorts
on
which
account
the
laborious
man
has
the
advantage
whose
diet
being
poor
and
body
robust
the
strength
of
such
liquors
gives
a
supply
and
better
digests
into
nourishment
but
for
the
unactive
man
a
hogshead
of
ale
which
is
made
from
six
bushels
of
malt
is
sufficient
for
a
diluter
of
their
food
and
will
better
assist
their
constitution
than
the
more
strong
sort
that
would
in
such
produce
obstructions
and
ill
humours
and
therefore
that
quantity
for
ale
and
ten
bushels
for
a
hogshead
of
strong
beer
that
should
not
be
tapp
under
nine
months
is
the
most
healthful
and
this
i
have
experienc
by
enjoying
such
an
amber
liquor
that
has
been
truly
brewed
from
good
malt
as
to
be
of
a
vinous
nature
that
would
permit
of
a
hearty
dose
over
night
and
yet
the
next
morning
leave
a
person
light
brisk
and
unconcern
this
then
is
the
true
nostrum
of
brewing
and
ought
to
be
studied
and
endeavoured
for
by
all
those
that
can
afford
to
follow
the
foregoing
rules
and
then
it
will
supply
in
a
great
measure
those
chargeable
and
often
adulterated
tartarous
arthritick
wines
so
likewise
for
small
beer
especially
in
a
family
where
it
is
not
of
a
body
enough
the
drinkers
will
be
feeble
in
hot
weather
and
not
be
able
to
perform
their
work
and
will
also
bring
on
distempers
besides
the
loss
of
time
and
a
great
waste
of
such
beer
that
is
generally
much
thrown
away
because
drink
is
certainly
a
nourisher
of
the
body
as
well
as
meats
and
the
more
substantial
they
both
are
the
better
will
the
labourer
go
through
his
work
especially
at
harvest
and
in
large
families
the
doctor
bills
have
proved
the
evil
of
this
bad
oeconomy
and
far
surmounted
the
charge
of
that
malt
that
would
have
kept
the
servants
in
good
health
and
preserved
the
beer
from
such
waste
as
the
smaller
sort
is
liable
to
is
therefore
that
some
prudent
farmers
will
brew
their
ale
and
small
beer
in
by
allowing
of
five
or
six
bushels
of
malt
and
two
pounds
of
hops
to
the
hogshead
of
ale
and
a
quarter
of
malt
and
three
pounds
of
hops
to
five
barrels
of
small
beer
others
there
are
that
will
brew
their
ale
or
strong
beer
in
and
their
small
beer
a
month
before
it
is
wanted
others
will
brew
their
ale
and
small
beer
in
and
but
this
according
to
humour
and
therefore
i
have
hinted
of
the
several
seasons
for
brewing
these
liquors
however
in
my
opinion
whether
it
be
strong
or
small
drinks
they
should
be
clear
smooth
and
not
too
small
if
they
are
design
for
profit
and
health
for
if
they
are
otherwise
it
will
be
a
sad
evil
to
harvest
men
because
then
they
stand
most
in
need
of
the
greatest
balsamicks
to
this
end
some
of
the
softning
ingredients
mentioned
in
the
foregoing
receipts
should
be
made
use
of
to
feed
it
accordingly
if
these
drinks
are
brewed
forward
and
that
this
particular
important
article
in
the
brewing
oeconomy
may
be
better
understood
i
shall
here
recite
opinion
of
malt
liquors
viz
the
age
of
malt
drinks
makes
them
more
or
less
wholsome
and
seems
to
do
somewhat
the
same
as
hops
for
those
liquors
which
are
longest
kept
are
certainly
the
least
viscid
age
by
degrees
breaking
the
viscid
parts
and
rendering
them
smaller
makes
them
finer
for
secretion
but
this
is
always
to
be
determined
by
their
strength
because
in
proportion
to
that
will
they
sooner
or
later
come
to
their
full
perfection
and
likewise
their
decay
until
the
finer
spirits
quite
make
their
escape
and
the
remainder
becomes
vapid
and
sour
by
what
therefore
has
been
already
said
it
will
appear
that
the
older
drinks
are
the
more
healthful
so
they
be
kept
up
to
this
standard
but
not
beyond
it
some
therefore
are
of
opinion
that
strong
beer
brewed
in
should
be
tapp
at
and
that
brewed
in
at
as
being
most
agreeable
to
the
seasons
of
the
year
that
follow
such
brewings
for
then
they
will
both
have
part
of
a
summer
and
winter
to
ripen
and
digest
their
several
bodies
and
is
my
humble
opinion
that
where
the
strength
of
the
beer
the
quantity
of
hops
the
boiling
fermentation
and
the
cask
are
all
rightly
managed
there
drink
may
be
most
excellent
and
better
at
nine
months
age
than
at
nine
years
for
health
and
pleasure
of
body
but
to
be
truly
certain
of
the
right
time
there
should
be
first
an
examination
made
by
pegging
the
vessel
to
prove
if
such
drink
is
fine
the
hop
sufficiently
rotted
and
it
be
mellow
and
well
tasted
chap
xx
the
pleasure
and
profit
of
private
brewing
and
the
charge
of
buying
malt
here
i
am
to
treat
of
the
main
article
of
shewing
the
difference
between
brewing
our
own
ales
and
beers
and
buying
them
which
i
doubt
not
will
appear
so
plain
and
evident
as
to
convince
any
reader
that
many
persons
may
save
well
towards
half
in
half
and
have
their
beer
and
ale
strong
fine
and
aged
at
their
own
discretion
a
satisfaction
that
is
of
no
small
weight
and
the
rather
since
i
have
now
made
known
a
method
of
brewing
a
quantity
of
malt
with
a
little
copper
and
a
few
tubs
a
secret
that
has
long
wanted
publication
for
now
a
person
may
brew
in
a
little
room
and
that
very
safely
by
keeping
his
wort
from
foxing
as
i
have
already
explained
which
by
many
has
been
thought
impossible
heretofore
and
this
direction
is
the
more
valuable
as
there
are
many
thousands
who
live
in
cities
and
towns
that
have
no
more
than
a
few
yards
square
of
room
to
perform
a
private
brewing
in
and
as
for
the
trouble
it
is
easy
to
account
for
by
those
who
have
time
enough
on
their
hands
and
would
do
nothing
else
if
they
had
not
done
this
or
if
a
man
is
paid
half
a
crown
a
day
for
a
quantity
accordingly
or
if
a
servant
can
do
this
besides
his
other
work
for
the
same
wages
and
charge
i
believe
the
following
account
will
make
it
appear
it
is
considerably
by
what
such
a
person
may
save
in
this
undertaking
besides
the
pleasure
of
thoroughly
knowing
the
several
ingredients
and
cleanliness
of
the
brewer
and
utensils
in
several
of
the
northern
counties
of
where
they
have
good
barley
malt
and
the
drink
brewed
at
home
there
are
seldom
any
bad
ales
or
beers
because
they
have
the
knowledge
in
brewing
so
well
that
there
are
hardly
any
common
brewers
amongst
them
in
the
west
indeed
there
are
some
few
but
in
the
south
and
east
parts
there
are
many
and
now
follows
the
account
that
i
have
stated
according
to
my
own
general
practice
viz
calculation
of
the
charge
and
profit
of
brewing
six
bushels
of
malt
for
a
private
six
bushels
of
malt
at
bushel
barley
being
this
year
sold
for
quarter
by
the
farmer
hops
one
pound
yeast
a
quart
coals
one
bushel
or
if
wood
or
furze
a
man
wages
a
day
total
these
six
bushels
of
malt
i
make
one
hogshead
of
ale
and
another
of
small
beer
but
if
i
was
to
buy
them
of
some
common
brewers
the
charge
will
be
as
viz
one
hogshead
of
ale
containing
gallons
at
gallon
is
one
hogshead
of
small
beer
containing
gallons
at
gallon
is
total
saved
by
the
above
account
it
plainly
appears
that
and
is
clearly
gained
in
brewing
of
six
bushels
of
malt
at
our
own
house
for
a
private
family
and
yet
i
make
the
charge
fuller
by
and
then
it
will
happen
with
many
whose
conveniency
by
servants
may
intirely
take
it
off
besides
the
six
bushels
of
grains
that
are
currently
sold
for
the
bushel
which
will
make
the
eleven
and
more
by
four
shillings
without
reckoning
any
thing
for
yeast
that
in
the
very
cheapest
time
sells
here
for
the
quart
and
many
times
there
happens
three
quarts
from
so
much
drink
so
that
there
may
possibly
be
gained
in
all
sixteen
shillings
and
a
fine
sum
indeed
in
so
small
a
quantity
of
malt
but
here
by
course
will
arise
a
question
whether
this
ale
is
as
good
as
that
bought
of
some
of
the
common
brewers
at
a
gallon
i
ca
say
all
is
however
i
can
aver
this
that
the
ale
i
brew
in
the
country
from
six
bushels
of
malt
for
my
family
i
think
is
generally
full
as
good
if
not
better
than
any
i
ever
sold
at
that
price
in
my
brewhouse
and
if
i
should
say
that
where
the
malt
water
and
hops
are
right
good
and
the
brewer
skill
answerable
to
them
there
might
be
a
hogshead
of
as
good
ale
and
another
of
small
beer
made
from
five
bushels
as
i
desire
to
use
for
my
family
or
for
harvest
men
it
is
no
more
than
i
have
many
times
experienced
and
is
the
common
length
i
made
for
that
purpose
and
whoever
makes
use
of
true
pale
and
amber
malts
and
pursues
the
directions
of
this
book
i
doubt
not
but
will
have
their
expectation
fully
answered
in
this
last
quantity
and
so
save
the
great
expence
of
excise
that
the
common
brewers
drink
is
always
clogg
with
which
is
blotted

philosophical
account
for
brewing
october
by
an
ingenious
in
brewing
your
malt
ought
to
be
sound
and
good
and
after
its
making
to
lye
two
or
more
months
in
the
heap
to
come
to
such
a
temper
that
the
kernel
may
readily
melt
in
the
washing
the
well
dressing
your
malt
ought
to
be
one
chief
care
for
unless
it
be
freed
from
the
tails
and
dust
your
drink
will
not
be
fine
and
mellow
as
when
it
is
clean
dressed
the
grinding
also
must
be
considered
according
to
the
high
or
low
drying
of
the
malt
for
if
high
dryed
then
a
gross
grinding
is
best
otherwise
a
smaller
may
be
done
for
the
care
in
grinding
consists
herein
lest
too
much
of
the
husk
being
ground
small
should
mix
with
the
liquor
which
makes
a
gross
feces
and
consequently
your
drink
will
have
too
fierce
a
fermentation
and
by
that
means
make
it
acid
or
that
we
call
stale
when
your
malt
is
ground
let
it
stand
in
sacks
hours
at
least
to
the
end
that
the
heat
in
grinding
may
be
allayed
and
is
conceived
by
its
so
standing
that
the
kernel
will
dissolve
the
better
the
measure
and
quantity
we
allow
of
hops
and
malt
is
five
quarter
of
malt
to
three
hogsheads
of
beer
and
eighteen
pounds
of
hops
at
least
to
that
quantity
of
malt
and
if

the

of
liquor
for

of
considerable

in
making

the

be

your
harsh

use
of
you
are
to
boil
your

liquor
adding
a
handful
or
two
of
hops
to
it
then
before
you
strike
it
over

your
goods

malt
cool
in
as

liquor
as
will
bring

not

not

the
liquor
as

as
possible
but
not
to

do
the

and
indeed
all
your
liquors
ought
to
be
taken
as
high
as
may
be
that
is
not

when
you
let
your

from
your

into
the

put
to
it
a
handful
or
two
of
hops
preserve
it
from
that
accident
which
brewers
call
blinking
or
foxing
in
boiling
your
worts
the

wort
boil
high
or
quick
for
the
quicker
the
first

is
boiled
the
better
it
is
the
second
boil
more
than
the
first
and
the
third
or
last
more
than
the
second
in
cooling
lay
your
worts
thin
and
let
each
be
well
cooled
and
care
must
be
taken
in
letting
them
down
into
the
tun
that
you
do
it
leisurely
to
the
end
that
as
little
of
the
feces
or
sediment
which
causes
the
fermentation
to
be
fierce
or
mild
for
note
there
is
in
all
fermented
liquors
salt
and
sulphur
and
to
keep
these
two
bodies
in
a
due
proportion
that
the
salt
does
not
exalt
itself
above
the
sulphur
consists
a
great
part
of
the
art
in
brewing
when
your
wort
is
first
let
into
your
tun
put
but
a
little
yeast
to
it
and
let
it
work
by
degrees
quietly
and
if
you
find
it
works
but
moderate
whip
in
the
yeast
two
or
three
times
or
more
till
you
find
your
drink
well
fermented
for
without
a
full
opening
of
the
body
by
fermentation
it
will
not
be
perfect
fine
nor
will
it
drink
clean
and
light
when
you
cleanse
do
it
by
a
cock
from
your
tun
placed
six
inches
from
the
bottom
to
the
end
that
most
of
the
sediment
may
be
left
behind
which
may
be
thrown
on
your
malt
to
mend
your
small
beer
when
your
drink
is
tunn
fill
your
vessel
full
let
it
work
at
the
and
have
a
reserve
in
a
small
cask
to
fill
it
up
and
do
put
any
of
the
drink
which
will
be
under
the
yeast
after
it
is
work
over
into
your
vessels
but
put
it
by
itself
in
another
cask
for
it
will
not
be
so
good
as
your
other
in
the
cask
this
done
you
must
wait
for
the
finishing
of
the
fermentation
then
stop
it
close
and
let
it
stand
till
the
spring
for
brewing
ought
to
be
done
in
the
month
of
that
it
may
have
time
to
settle
and
digest
all
the
winter
season
in
the
spring
you
must
unstop
your
and
thereby
see
whether
your
drink
doth
ferment
or
not
for
as
soon
as
the
warm
weather
comes
your
drink
will
have
another
fermentation
which
when
it
is
over
let
it
be
again
well
stopped
and
stand
till
or
longer
and
then
peg
it
and
if
you
find
it
pretty
fine
the
hop
well
rotted
and
of
a
good
pleasant
taste
for
drinking
then
and
not
before
draw
out
a
gallon
of
it
put
to
it
two
ounces
of
cut
small
and
well
beaten
to
melt
stirring
it
often
and
whip
it
with
a
wisk
till
the
be
melted
then
strain
it
and
put
it
into
your
vessel
stirring
it
well
together
stop
the
bung
slightly
for
this
will
cause
a
new
and
small
fermentation
when
that
is
over
stop
it
close
leaving
only
a
a
little
stopp
let
it
stand
and
in
ten
days
or
a
little
more
it
will
be
transparently
fine
and
you
may
drink
of
it
out
of
the
vessel
till
two
parts
in
three
be
drawn
then
bottle
the
rest
which
will
in
a
little
time
come
to
drink
very
well
if
your
drink
in
be
well
condition
for
taste
but
not
fine
and
you
desire
to
drink
it
presently
rack
it
before
you
put
your
to
it
and
then
it
will
fine
the
better
and
drink
the
cleaner
to
make
drink
fine
quickly
i
have
been
told
that
by
separating
the
liquor
from
the
feces
when
the
wort
is
let
out
of
the
tun
into
the
underback
which
may
be
done
in
this
manner
when
you
let
your
wort
into
your
underback
out
of
your
tun
catch
the
wort
in
some
tub
so
long
and
so
often
as
you
find
it
run
foul
put
that
so
catched
on
the
malt
again
and
do
so
till
the
wort
run
clear
into
the
underback
this
is
to
me
a
very
good
way
where
it
may
be
done
for
is
the
feces
which
causes
the
fierce
and
violent
fermentation
and
to
hinder
that
in
some
measure
is
the
way
to
have
fine
drink
note
that
the
finer
you
make
your
wort
the
sooner
your
drink
will
be
fine
for
i
have
heard
that
some
curious
in
brewing
have
caused
flannels
to
be
so
placed
that
all
the
wort
may
run
thro
one
or
more
of
them
into
the
tun
before
working
by
which
means
the
drink
was
made
very
fine
and
well
tasted
on
the
foregoing
this
excellent
philosophical
account
of
brewing
beer
has
hitherto
remained
in
private
hands
as
a
very
great
secret
and
was
given
to
a
friend
of
mine
by
the
author
himself
to
whom
the
world
is
much
obliged
altho
it
comes
by
me
in
justice
therefore
to
this
ingenious
person
i
would
here
mention
his
name
had
i
leave
for
so
doing
but
at
present
this
intimation
must
suffice
however
i
shall
here
take
notice
that
his
caution
against
using
tailed
or
dusty
malt
which
is
too
commonly
sold
is
truly
worthy
of
observation
for
these
are
so
far
from
producing
more
ale
or
beer
that
they
absorb
and
drink
part
of
it
up
in
grinding
malts
he
notifies
well
to
prevent
a
foul
drink
the
quantity
he
allows
is
something
above
thirteen
bushels
to
the
hogshead
which
is
very
sufficient
but
this
as
every
body
pleases
the
choice
of
liquors
or
waters
for
brewing
he
says
is
of
considerable
advantage
and
so
must
every
body
else
that
knows
their
natures
and
loves
health
and
pleasant
drink
for
this
purpose
in
my
opinion
the
air
and
soil
is
to
be
regarded
where
the
brewing
is
performed
since
the
air
affects
all
things
it
can
come
at
whether
animal
vegetable
or
mineral
as
may
be
proved
from
many
instances
in
the
marshes
of
and
the
air
there
is
generally
so
infectious
by
means
of
those
low
vaesy
boggy
grounds
that
seldom
a
person
escapes
an
ague
one
time
or
other
whether
natives
or
aliens
and
is
often
fatally
known
to
some
of
the
and
others
who
merrily
and
nimbly
travel
down
to
the
isles
of
and
for
a
valuable
harvest
but
in
a
month
time
they
generally
return
thro
the
village
of
with
another
mien
there
is
also
a
little
in
thro
which
a
water
runs
that
frequently
gives
the
horses
that
drink
of
it
the
colick
or
gripes
by
means
of
the
aluminous
sharp
particles
of
its
earth
its
air
is
also
so
bad
as
has
obliged
several
to
remove
from
its
situation
for
their
healths
the
dominion
of
the
air
is
likewise
so
powerful
over
vegetables
that
what
will
grow
in
one
place
wo
in
another
as
is
plain
from
the
beech
and
black
cherry
tree
that
refuse
the
vale
of
tho
on
some
hills
there
yet
will
thrive
in
the
or
hilly
country
so
the
limes
and
other
trees
about
are
all
generally
while
those
in
the
country
are
most
of
them
of
a
silver
white
water
is
also
so
far
under
the
influence
of
the
air
and
soil
as
makes
many
excellent
for
brewing
when
others
are
as
bad
in
rivers
that
run
boggy
places
the
sullage
or
washings
of
such
soils
are
generally
unwholsome
as
the
nature
of
such
ground
is
and
so
the
water
becomes
infected
by
that
and
the
effluvia
or
vapour
that
accompanies
such
water
so
ponds
are
surely
good
or
bad
as
they
are
under
too
much
cover
or
supply
by
nasty
drains
or
as
they
stand
situated
or
exposed
to
good
and
bad
airs
thus
the
by
consequence
share
in
the
good
or
bad
effects
of
such
soils
that
they
run
thorough
and
the
very
surface
of
the
earth
by
which
such
waters
are
strained
is
surely
endowed
with
the
quality
of
the
air
in
which
it
lies
which
brings
me
to
my
intended
purpose
to
prove
that
water
drawn
out
of
a
chalky
or
well
which
is
situated
under
a
dry
sweet
loamy
soil
in
a
fine
pure
air
and
that
is
perfectly
soft
must
excel
most
if
not
all
other
for
the
purpose
in
brewing
the
worts
also
that
are
rooted
in
such
an
air
in
course
partakes
of
its
nitrous
benefits
as
being
much
exposed
thereto
in
the
high
backs
or
coolers
that
contain
them
in
my
own
grounds
i
have
chalks
under
clays
and
loams
but
as
the
latter
is
better
than
the
former
so
the
water
proves
more
soft
and
wholsome
under
one
than
the
other
hence
then
may
be
observed
the
contrary
quality
of
those
harsh
curdling
that
many
drink
of
in
their
malt
liquors
without
considering
their
ill
effects
which
are
justly
condemn
by
this
able
author
as
unfit
to
be
made
use
of
in
brewing
beer
the
boiling
a
few
hops
in
the
first
water
is
good
but
they
must
be
strained
thro
a
sieve
before
the
water
is
put
into
the
malt
and
to
check
its
heat
with
cold
liquor
or
to
let
it
stand
to
cool
some
time
is
a
right
method
lest
it
scalds
and
locks
up
the
pores
of
the
malt
which
would
then
yield
a
thick
wort
to
the
end
of
the
brewing
and
never
be
good
drink
his
putting
hops
into
the
underback
is
an
excellent
contrivance
to
prevent
foxing
as
i
have
already
hinted
the
quick
boiling
of
the
wort
is
of
no
less
service
and
that
the
smaller
wort
should
be
boiled
longer
than
the
strong
is
good
judgment
because
the
stronger
the
wort
the
sooner
the
spirits
flie
away
and
the
waste
of
more
consequence
besides
if
the
first
wort
was
to
be
boiled
too
long
it
would
obtain
so
thick
a
body
as
to
prevent
in
great
measure
its
fining
hereafter
after
so
soon
in
the
barrel
while
the
smaller
sort
will
evaporate
its
more
watry
parts
and
thereby
be
brought
into
a
thicker
confidence
which
is
perfectly
necessary
in
thin
worts
and
in
this
article
lies
so
much
the
skill
of
the
brewer
that
some
will
make
a
longer
length
than
ordinary
from
the
goods
for
small
beer
to
shorten
it
afterwards
in
the
copper
by
length
of
boiling
and
this
way
of
consuming
it
is
the
more
natural
because
the
remaining
part
will
be
better
cured
the
laying
worts
thin
is
a
most
necessary
precaution
for
this
is
one
way
to
prevent
their
running
into
cohesions
and
foxing
the
want
of
which
knowledge
and
care
has
undoubtedly
been
the
occasion
of
great
losses
in
brewing
for
when
worts
are
tainted
in
any
considerable
degree
they
will
be
ropy
in
time
and
unfit
for
the
human
body
as
being
unwholsome
as
well
as
unpleasant
so
likewise
is
his
of
great
importance
when
he
advises
to
draw
the
worts
off
fine
out
of
the
backs
or
coolers
and
leave
the
feces
or
sediments
behind
by
reason
as
he
says
they
are
the
cause
of
those
two
detested
qualities
in
malt
liquors
staleness
and
foulness
two
properties
that
ought
to
imploy
the
greatest
care
in
brewers
to
prevent
for
is
certain
these
sediments
are
a
composition
of
the
very
worst
part
of
the
malt
hops
and
yeast
and
while
they
are
in
the
barrel
will
so
tincture
and
impregnate
the
drink
with
their
insanous
and
unpleasant
nature
that
its
drinkers
will
be
sure
to
participate
thereof
more
or
less
as
they
have
lain
together
a
longer
or
a
shorter
time
to
have
then
a
malt
drink
balsamick
and
mild
the
worts
can
not
be
run
off
too
fine
from
the
coolers
nor
well
fermented
too
slow
that
there
may
be
a
medium
kept
in
both
the
salt
and
sulphur
that
all
fermented
malt
drinks
abound
with
and
herein
as
he
says
lies
a
great
part
of
the
art
of
brewing
he
says
truly
well
that
a
little
yeast
at
first
should
be
put
to
the
wort
that
it
may
quietly
work
by
degrees
and
not
be
violently
into
a
high
fermentation
for
then
by
course
the
salt
and
sulphur
will
be
too
violently
agitated
into
such
an
excess
and
disagreement
of
parts
that
will
break
their
unity
into
irregular
commotions
and
cause
the
drink
to
be
soon
stale
and
harsh
but
if
it
should
be
too
backward
and
work
too
moderate
then
whipping
the
yeast
two
or
three
times
into
it
will
be
of
some
service
to
open
the
body
of
the
beer
for
as
he
observes
if
drink
has
not
a
due
fermentation
it
will
not
be
fine
clean
nor
light
his
advice
to
draw
the
drink
out
of
the
tun
by
a
cock
at
such
a
distance
from
the
bottom
is
right
because
that
room
will
best
keep
the
feces
from
being
disturb
as
the
drink
is
drawing
off
and
leaving
them
behind
but
for
putting
them
afterwards
over
the
malt
for
small
beer
i
do
hold
it
consonant
with
good
brewing
by
reason
in
this
sediment
there
are
many
particles
of
the
yeast
that
consequently
will
cause
a
small
fermentation
in
the
liquor
and
malt
and
be
a
means
to
spoil
rather
than
make
good
small
beer
what
he
says
of
filling
up
the
cask
with
a
reserve
of
the
same
drink
and
not
with
that
which
has
once
worked
out
is
past
dispute
just
and
right
and
so
is
what
he
says
of
stopping
up
the
vessel
close
after
the
fermentation
is
over
but
that
it
is
best
to
brew
all
strong
beer
in
i
must
here
take
leave
to
dissent
from
the
tenet
because
there
is
room
for
several
objections
in
relation
to
the
sort
of
malt
and
cellar
which
as
i
have
before
explained
shall
say
the
less
here
as
he
observes
care
should
be
taken
in
the
spring
to
unstop
the
vent
lest
the
warm
weather
cause
such
a
fermentation
as
may
burst
the
cask
and
also
in
that
it
be
first
try
by
pegging
if
the
drink
is
fine
well
tasted
and
the
hop
rotted
and
then
if
his
way
is
liked
best
bring
the
rest
into
a
transparent
fineness
for
clearness
in
malt
liquors
as
i
said
before
and
here
repeat
it
again
is
a
most
agreeable
quality
that
every
man
ought
to
enjoy
for
his
health
and
pleasure
and
therefore
he
advises
for
dispatch
in
this
affair
and
to
have
the
drink
very
fine
to
rack
it
off
before
the
is
put
in
but
i
ca
be
a
votary
for
this
practice
as
believing
the
drink
must
lose
a
great
deal
of
its
spirits
by
such
shifting
yet
i
must
chime
in
with
his
notion
of
putting
the
wort
so
often
over
the
malt
till
it
comes
off
fine
as
i
have
already
taught
which
is
a
method
that
has
been
used
many
years
in
the
north
of
where
they
are
so
curious
as
to
let
the
wort
lie
some
time
in
the
underback
to
draw
it
off
from
the
feces
there
nor
are
they
less
careful
to
run
it
fine
out
of
the
cooler
into
the
tun
and
from
that
into
the
cask
in
all
which
three
several
places
the
wort
and
drink
may
be
had
clear
and
fine
and
then
there
will
be
no
more
sediments
than
is
just
necessary
to
assist
and
seed
the
beer
and
preserving
its
spirits
in
a
due
temper
but
if
persons
have
time
and
conveniency
and
their
inclination
leads
them
to
obtain
their
drink
in
the
utmost
fineness
it
is
an
extraordinary
good
way
to
use
sleeve
or
flannel
bag
which
i
did
in
my
great
at
for
straining
off
the
feces
that
were
left
in
the
backs
as
to
the
quantity
of
malt
for
brewing
a
hogshead
of
beer
i
am
of
opinion
thirteen
bushels
are
right
and
so
are
ten
fifteen
and
twenty
according
as
people
approve
of
for
near
i
know
some
have
brewed
a
hogshead
of
beer
from
sixteen
bushels
of
barley
malt
one
of
wheat
one
of
beans
one
of
pease
and
one
of
oat
malt
besides
hanging
a
bag
of
flower
taken
out
of
the
last
four
malts
in
the
hogshead
for
the
drink
to
feed
on
nor
can
a
certain
time
be
limited
and
adjusted
for
the
tapping
of
any
drink
notwithstanding
what
has
been
affirmed
to
the
contrary
because
some
hops
will
not
be
rotted
so
soon
as
others
and
some
drinks
will
not
fine
so
soon
as
others
as
is
evident
in
the
pale
malt
drinks
that
will
seldom
or
never
break
so
soon
in
the
copper
as
the
brown
sort
nor
will
they
be
so
soon
ripe
and
fit
to
tap
as
the
high
dryed
malt
drink
will
therefore
what
this
gentleman
says
of
trying
drink
by
first
pegging
it
before
it
is
tapp
in
my
opinion
is
more
just
and
right
than
relying
on
a
limited
time
for
broaching
such
beer
