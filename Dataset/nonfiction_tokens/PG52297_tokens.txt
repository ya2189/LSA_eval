in

in
the
social

but
it
is
a
faith
which
is
perhaps
best
preserved
by
careful
avoidance
of
too
much
inquiry
into
facts
the
theory
if
applied
to
past
as
well
as
to
present
times
would
involve
us
in
some
startling
contradictions
for
there
is
hardly
any
act
habit
or
custom
which
has
not
been
held
meritorious
and
commendable
in
one
state
of
society
and
detestable
and
evil
in
some
other
if
we
believe
that
there
are
eternal
principles
of
right
and
wrong
wisdom
and
equity
far
above
and
greater
than
the
of
any
one
age
or
country
we
must
acknowledge
the
absolute
obligation
of
inquiring
whenever
matters
of
importance
are
at
stake
on
what
grounds
the
popular
opinions
rest
and
how
far
they
are
the
result
of
habit
custom
and
prejudice
or
the
real
outgrowth
of
deep
convictions
and
beliefs
inherent
in
the
most
sacred
recesses
of
human
nature
while
the
latter
command
ever
our
deepest
reverence
as
the
true
populi
vox
dei
nothing
can
be
more
superficial
frivolous
and
fallacious
than
the
former
in
a
country
where
precedent
has
so
much
weight
as
in
england
it
doubly
behoves
us
to
make
the
distinction
and
while
gratefully
accepting
the
safeguard
offered
against
inconsiderate
and
precipitate
change
to
beware
that
old
custom
is
not
suffered
permanently
to
hide
from
our
eyes
any
truth
which
may
be
struggling
into
the
light
i
suppose
that
no
thinking
man
will
pretend
that
the
world
has
now
reached
the
zenith
of
truth
and
knowledge
and
that
no
further
upward
progress
is
possible
on
the
contrary
we
must
surely
believe
that
each
year
will
bring
with
it
its
new
lesson
fresh
lights
will
constantly
be
dawning
above
the
horizon
and
perhaps
still
oftener
discoveries
will
be
truths
once
acknowledged
but
gradually
obscured
or
forgotten
will
emerge
again
into
day
and
a
constantly
recurring
duty
will
lie
before
every
one
who
believes
in
life
as
a
responsible
time
of
action
and
not
as
a
period
of
mere
vegetative
existence
to
all
things
and
hold
fast
that
which
is
the
above
considerations
arise
naturally
in
connexion
with
the
subject
of
this
paper
which
is
too
often
set
aside
by
the
general
public
who
perhaps
hardly
appreciate
its
scope
and
are
not
yet
fully
aroused
to
the
importance
of
the
questions
involved
in
the
general
issue
we
are
told
so
often
that
nature
and
custom
have
alike
decided
against
the
admission
of
women
to
the
medical
profession
and
that
there
is
in
such
admission
something
repugnant
to
the
right
order
of
things
that
when
we
see
growing
evidences
of
a
different
opinion
among
a
minority
perhaps
but
a
minority
which
already
includes
many
of
our
most
earnest
thinkers
of
both
sexes
and
increases
daily
it
surely
becomes
a
duty
for
all
who
do
not
in
the
quaint
language
of
sharpe
their
thinking
like
their
washing
done
out
to
test
these
statements
by
the
above
principles
and
to
see
how
far
their
truth
is
supported
by
evidence
in
the
first
place
let
us
take
the
testimony
of
nature
in
the
matter
if
we
go
back
to
primeval
times
and
try
to
imagine
the
first
sickness
or
the
first
injury
suffered
by
humanity
does
one
instinctively
feel
that
it
must
have
been
the
business
to
seek
means
of
healing
to
try
the
virtues
of
various
herbs
or
to
apply
such
rude
remedies
as
might
occur
to
one
unused
to
the
strange
spectacle
of
human
suffering
i
think
that
few
would
maintain
that
such
ministration
would
come
most
naturally
to
the
man
and
be
instinctively
avoided
by
the
woman
indeed
i
fancy
that
the
presumption
would
be
rather
in
the
other
direction
and
what
is
such
ministration
but
the
germ
of
the
future
profession
of
medicine
nor
i
think
would
the
inference
be
different
if
we
appealed
to
the
actual
daily
experience
of
domestic
life
if
a
child
falls
down
stairs
and
is
more
or
less
seriously
hurt
is
it
the
father
or
the
mother
where
both
are
without
medical
training
who
is
most
equal
to
the
emergency
and
who
applies
the
needful
remedies
in
the
first
instance
or
again
in
the
heart
of
the
country
where
no
doctor
is
readily
accessible
is
it
the
squire
and
the
parson
or
their
respective
wives
who
are
usually
consulted
about
the
ailments
of
half
the
parish
of
course
it
may
be
said
that
such
practice
is
by
no
means
scientific
but
merely
empirical
and
this
i
readily
allow
but
that
fact
in
no
way
affects
my
argument
that
women
are
inclined
and
fitted
for
medical
practice
and
if
this
be
so
i
do
not
know
who
has
the
right
to
say
that
they
shall
not
be
allowed
to
make
their
work
scientific
when
they
desire
it
but
shall
be
limited
to
merely
the
mechanical
details
and
wearisome
routine
of
nursing
while
to
men
is
reserved
all
intelligent
knowledge
of
disease
and
all
study
of
the
laws
by
which
health
may
be
preserved
or
restored
again
imagine
if
you
can
that
the
world
has
reached
its
present
standing
point
that
society
exists
as
now
in
every
respect
but
this
that
the
art
of
healing
has
never
been
conceived
as
a
separate
profession
that
no
persons
have
been
set
apart
to
receive
special
education
for
it
and
that
in
fact
empirical
medicine
in
the
strictest
sense
is
the
only
thing
of
the
kind
existing
suppose
now
that
society
suddenly
awoke
to
the
great
want
so
long
unnoticed
that
it
was
recognized
by
all
that
a
scientific
knowledge
of
the
human
frame
in
health
and
in
disease
and
a
study
of
the
remedies
of
various
kinds
which
might
be
employed
as
curative
agents
would
greatly
lessen
human
suffering
and
that
it
was
therefore
resolved
at
once
to
set
apart
some
persons
who
should
acquire
such
knowledge
and
devote
their
lives
to
using
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
rest
of
the
race
in
such
case
would
the
natural
idea
be
that
members
of
each
sex
should
be
so
set
apart
for
the
benefit
of
their
own
sex
respectively
that
men
should
fit
themselves
to
minister
to
the
maladies
of
men
and
women
to
those
of
women
or
that
one
sex
only
should
undertake
the
care
of
the
health
of
all
under
all
circumstances
for
myself
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
the
former
seems
to
me
the
course
and
that
to
civilized
society
if
unaccustomed
to
the
idea
the
proposal
that
persons
of
one
sex
should
in
every
case
be
consulted
about
every
disease
incident
to
those
of
the
other
would
be
very
repugnant
nay
that
were
every
other
condition
of
society
the
same
as
now
it
would
probably
be
held
wholly
inadmissable
i
maintain
that
not
only
is
there
nothing
strange
or
unnatural
in
the
idea
that
women
are
the
fit
physicians
for
women
and
men
for
men
but
on
the
contrary
that
it
is
only
custom
and
habit
which
blind
society
to
the
extreme
strangeness
and
incongruity
of
any
other
notion
i
am
indeed
far
from
pretending
as
some
have
done
that
it
is
morally
wrong
for
men
to
be
the
medical
attendants
of
women
and
that
grave
mischiefs
are
the
frequent
and
natural
results
of
their
being
placed
in
that
position
i
believe
that
these
statements
not
only
materially
injure
the
cause
they
profess
to
serve
but
that
they
are
in
themselves
false
in
my
own
experience
as
a
medical
student
i
have
had
far
too
much
reason
to
acknowledge
the
honour
and
delicacy
of
feeling
habitually
shown
by
the
gentlemen
of
the
medical
profession
not
to
protest
warmly
against
any
such
injurious
imputation
i
am
very
sure
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
the
motives
and
conduct
of
medical
men
in
this
respect
are
altogether
above
question
and
that
every
physician
who
is
also
a
gentleman
is
thoroughly
able
when
consulted
by
a
patient
in
any
case
whatever
to
remember
only
the
human
suffering
brought
before
him
and
the
scientific
bearing
of
its
details
for
as
was
said
not
very
long
ago
by
a
most
eminent
london
surgeon
is
not
able
in
the
course
of
practice
to
put
the
idea
of
sex
out
of
his
mind
is
not
fit
for
the
medical
profession
at
it
will
however
occur
to
most
people
that
the
medical
man
is
only
one
of
the
parties
concerned
and
that
it
is
possible
that
a
difficulty
which
may
be
of
no
importance
from
his
scientific
standpoint
may
yet
be
very
formidable
indeed
to
the
far
more
sensitive
and
delicately
organized
feelings
of
his
patient
who
has
no
such
armour
of
proof
as
his
own
and
whose
very
condition
of
suffering
may
entail
an
even
exaggerated
condition
of
nervous
susceptibility
on
such
points
at
any
rate
when
we
hear
so
many
assertions
about
natural
instincts
and
social
propriety
i
can
not
but
assert
that
their
evidence
such
as
it
is
is
wholly
for
and
not
against
the
cause
of
women
as
physicians
for
their
own
sex
if
we
take
next
the
ground
of
custom
i
think
the
position
of
those
who
would
oppose
the
medical
education
of
women
is
far
less
tenable
than
is
generally
supposed
indeed
that
a
recent
writer
stated
no
more
than
the
truth
when
he
asserted
that
obloquy
which
attends
innovation
belongs
to
the
men
who
exclude
women
from
a
profession
in
which
they
once
had
a
recognised
i
believe
that
few
people
who
have
not
carefully
considered
the
question
from
an
historical
point
of
view
have
any
idea
of
the
amount
of
evidence
that
may
be
brought
to
support
this
view
of
the
case
referring
to
the
earliest
classical
times
we
find
distinct
mention
in
the
iliad
of
a
woman
skilled
in
the
science
of
medicine
and
a
similar
reference
occurs
also
in
the
odyssey
euripides
is
no
less
valuable
a
witness
on
this
point
he
describes
queen
phædra
as
disturbed
in
mind
and
out
of
health
and
represents
the
nurse
as
thus
addressing
her
thy
complaint
be
anything
of
the
more
secret
kind
here
are
women
at
hand
to
compose
the
disease
but
if
thy
distress
is
as
may
be
told
to
tell
it
that
it
may
be
reported
to
the
physicians
thus
indicating
a
prevailing
public
opinion
that
there
were
natural
and
rigid
limits
to
the
medical
attendance
of
men
and
women
and
that
therefore
some
women
were
specially
trained
to
do
what
the
regular
physicians
must
leave
undone
it
is
at
least
remarkable
to
find
such
evidence
of
general
feeling
on
this
matter
in
a
state
of
society
supposed
to
possess
much
less
delicacy
and
refinement
than
our
own
we
find
records
of
several
grecian
women
who
were
renowned
for
their
medical
skill
among
whom
may
be
instanced
olympias
of
thebes
whose
medical
learning
is
said
to
be
mentioned
by
pliny
and
aspasia
from
whose
writings
on
the
diseases
of
women
quotations
are
preserved
in
the
works
of
aëtius
a
mesopotamian
physician
on
the
authority
of
hyginus
rests
the
history
of
agnodice
the
athenian
maiden
whose
skill
and
success
in
medicine
was
the
cause
of
the
legal
opening
of
the
medical
profession
to
all
the
women
of
the
state
in
more
modern
times
when
almost
all
learning
was
garnered
into
the
religious
houses
which
were
not
only
the
libraries
but
the
hospitals
of
the
day
it
seems
evident
that
the
care
of
the
sick
and
wounded
fell
at
least
as
often
to
the
share
of
the
nunneries
as
of
the
monasteries
and
probably
medical
skill
such
as
it
was
found
place
among
the
sisters
quite
as
often
as
among
the
brethren
of
the
various
religious
orders
the
old
ballad
of
sir
isumbras
gives
one
illustration
out
of
many
of
the
prevailing
state
of
things
relating
how
the
nuns
received
the
wounded
knight
and
how
a
day
they
made
salves
new
and
laid
them
on
his
wounds
they
gafe
hym
metis
and
drynkes
lythe
and
heled
the
knyghte
wonder
it
may
be
remembered
that
sir
walter
scott
after
describing
how
rebecca
with
her
own
hands
to
examine
and
bind
up
the
wounds
goes
on
to
remark
youngest
reader
of
romances
and
romantic
ballads
must
recollect
how
often
the
females
during
the
dark
ages
as
they
are
called
were
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
surgery
the
jews
both
male
and
female
possessed
and
practised
the
medical
science
in
all
its
in
the
fourteenth
century
when
the
medical
school
of
salerno
enjoyed
high
reputation
we
find
record
of
a
female
physician
named
abella
who
lived
there
and
wrote
in
latin
various
works
on
medicine
early
in
the
next
century
an
italian
lady
dorotea
bocchi
was
actually
professor
of
medicine
at
the
university
of
bologna
and
among
the
traditions
of
the
same
university
is
preserved
the
name
of
alessandra
gigliani
who
in
even
earlier
times
was
a
learned
student
of
anatomy
in
the
sixteenth
century
at
alcarez
in
spain
lived
olivia
sabuco
de
nantes
who
a
large
knowledge
of
science
and
medicine
and
whose
medical
works
were
printed
at
madrid
in
it
is
clear
that
in
great
britain
at
an
early
period
women
were
commonly
found
among
the
irregular
practitioners
of
medicine
and
it
is
equally
clear
that
their
male
competitors
greatly
desired
to
deprive
them
of
the
right
to
practise
in
a
petition
was
presented
to
henry
praying

is
sufficiently
significant
on
this
point
for
in
neither
language
has
it
any
masculine
equivalent
and
the
clumsy
term
served
when
first
needed
and
used
to
mark
the
general
sense
of
what
the
writer
in
the
forcibly
calls
intrusion
into
that
which
natural
instinct
assigns
to
woman
as
her
proper
field
of
labour
and
this
same
very
suggestive
title
is
the
only
one
which
at
the
present
day
in
legal
phraseology
distinguishes
the
male
practitioners
of
this
branch
of
medical
art
from
the
time
of
moses
onwards
this
part
of
the
profession
has
always
been
mainly
in
the
hands
of
women
and
in
many
countries
of
europe
no
other
usage
has
ever
prevailed
the
first
regular
french
medical
society
confrairie
de
st
cosme
and
st
damien
included
within
its
organization
the
company
of
midwives
and
from
that
time
down
to
the
present
it
seems
in
france
to
have
been
the
custom
to
give
to
these
women
a
regular
education
terminating
in
sufficient
examinations
an
example
which
england
would
have
done
well
to
follow
in
this
country
however
midwives
appear
to
have
held
a
most
respectable
position
some
centuries
ago
and
a
curious
idea
of
their
importance
their
duties
and
their
credit
may
be
gathered
from
a
volume
without
date
now
preserved
in
the
british
museum
which
was
evidently
written
at
a
time
when
hardly
any
but
women
were
employed
in
the
of
the
profession
and
when
it
was
a
comparatively
rare
thing
that
needed
to
be
specially
advised
in
certain
cases
for
them
to
use
of
call
in
a
the
writer
remarks
that
is
meet
that
the
midwife
be
a
woman
well
read
and
well
experienced
and
gives
a
caution
that
is
a
sordid
sin
in
any
who
use
it
but
is
a
blemish
worthy
greater
blame
in
ministers
magistrates
midwives
physitiens
and
mrs
celleor
in
her
letter
previously
referred
to
tells
us
that
in
physitiens
and
chirurgeons
contending
about
it
midwifery
was
adjudged
a
chirurgical
operation
and
midwives
were
licensed
at
hall
but
not
till
they
had
passed
three
examinations
before
six
skilful
midwives
and
as
many
chirurgeons
but
for
some
reason
connected
probably
with
their
occasional
baptismal
functions
the
midwives
were
in
referred
for
their
licence
to
commons
thus
losing
their
official
connexion
with
the
medical
world
how
it
came
that
english
midwives
fell
gradually
from
their
high
estate
is
partly
explained
by
a
very
book
with
the
appropriate
motto
sibi
sed
written
by
a
surgeon
in
the
writer
adverts
to
the
accusations
of
ignorance
then
brought
against
the
midwives
and
remarks
that
only
method
by
which
this
fatal
distemper
can
be
cured
is
to
put
it
in
the
power
of
midwomen
to
qualify
themselves
thoroughly
and
at
a
moderate
expense
to
which
method
of
qualifying
themselves
i
doubt
not
the
midwomen
will
object
and
say
that
they
would
readily
be
at
any
reasonable
expense
and
fatigue
to
be
so
thoroughly
instructed
but
it
is
not
in
their
power
the
midwomen
can
not
and
the
midmen
will
not
instruct
them
the
midmen
will
object
and
say
that
the
midwomen
want
both
capacity
and
strength
instruct
them
as
ye
please
to
which
i
reply
rotundo
plenis
that
it
is
not
want
of
capacity
docility
strength
or
activity
which
is
evident
to
a
demonstration
from
the
successful
practice
of
women
in
the
hôtel
dieu
at
paris
the
best
school
for
midwifery
now
in
europe
would
not
any
person
then
be
deservedly
laughed
at
who
should
assert
that
our
women
are
not
as
capable
of
performing
their
office
had
they
the
same
instruction
as
the
french
women
this
chivalrous
surgeon
then
proposes
that
regular
provision
should
be
made
for
proper
instruction
and
for
examinations
by
two
surgeons
who
have
lectured
to
the
women
six
or
seven
other
persons
appointed
by
his
majesty
because
i
think
it
reasonable
that
so
many
bread
should
depend
on
the
humour
or
caprice
of
two
men
only
adding
that
some
such
scheme
was
put
in
execution
satisfied
that
in
a
very
few
years
there
would
not
be
an
ignorant
midwife
in
england
and
consequently
the
great
agonies
most
women
suffer
at
the
very
sight
of
a
man
would
be
almost
entirely
prevented
and
great
expense
and
much
life
saved
however
we
must
suppose
that
these
noble
words
of
protest
fell
upon
deaf
ears
and
the
midwives
being
left
in
their
ignorance
their
practice
gradually
passed
into
the
hands
of
the
medical
men
who
had
every
advantage
of
learning
at
their
command
it
is
however
only
very
recently
that
have
been
allowed
to
attend
on
royal
patients
in
this
country
indeed
i
believe
that
the
princess
charlotte
was
the
first
to
establish
the
precedent
and
that
our
present
sovereign
was
the
first
queen
who
followed
it
in
a
very
interesting
series
of
papers
by
dr
aveling
recently
published
in
the
accounts
have
been
given
of
a
number
of
the
royal
midwives
whose
names
have
been
honourably
preserved
in
history
such
as
alice
dennis
who
attended
anne
of
denmark
and
received
a
fee
of
her
pains
and
attendance
upon
the
queen
as
of
his
free
gift
and
reward
without
account
imprest
or
other
charge
to
be
set
on
her
for
the
the
same
writer
mentions
that
margaret
mercer
was
sent
express
from
england
in
to
attend
on
dearest
daughter
the
princess
electress
it
is
also
recorded
that
labany
attended
mary
of
modena
queen
of
james
when
she
was
delivered
on
june
of
james
francis
edward
afterwards
called
the
mrs
wilkins
another
midwife
seems
also
to
have
been
present
on
this
occasion
and
it
is
stated
that
each
of
these
persons
received
a
fee
of
five
hundred
guineas
for
her
services
it
is
well
known
that
queen
charlotte
was
always
attended
by
a
woman
and
the
late
duchess
of
kent
employed
the
frau
von
siebold
of
whom
mention
is
made
elsewhere
now
that
public
attention
is
awaking
to
the
subject
and
educated
women
are
once
more
desirous
of
undertaking
this
peculiarly
womanly
work
we
may
indeed
anticipate
with
the
already
quoted
writer
in
the
that
a
reactionary
movement
will
soon
make
itself
felt
and
that
the
usage
even
up
to
the
present
time
a
large
proportion
of
our
english
families
especially
those
of
our
northern
towns
and
outlying
country
districts
have
never
adopted
will
most
likely
be
discontinued
in
all
classes
of
english
society
before
the
end
of
the
present
on
the
continent
of
europe
owing
to
their
better
education
the
midwives
retain
much
of
the
position
that
they
have
for
a
time
lost
in
england
and
we
hear
that
in
russia
medical
man
is
very
rarely
called
in
notwithstanding
fatal
cases
are
of
far
less
frequent
occurrence
in
russia
than
in
england
and
the
same
authority
tells
us
that
ladies
practising
midwifery
are
admitted
into
society
as
doctors
would
be
and
are
well
paid
both
by
the
government
and
by
private
fees
while
thus
briefly
tracing
out
the
history
of
midwifery
in
modern
times
and
the
causes
which
led
to
its
practice
passing
from
the
hands
of
women
into
those
of
men
i
have
not
paused
to
mention
in
due
chronological
order
those
women
who
in
the
last
three
centuries
have
been
distinguished
for
a
knowledge
of
the
other
branches
of
medicine
and
surgery
of
these
i
will
now
enumerate
a
few
though
my
time
and
space
are
far
too
limited
either
to
give
a
complete
list
or
to
relate
any
but
the
most
prominent
particulars
of
each
case
mentioned
but
i
can
promise
that
any
one
who
will
consult
the
authorities
quoted
will
be
abundantly
repaid
by
the
long
and
interesting
details
that
i
am
forced
to
pass
over
in
almost
every
instance
in
the
seventeenth
century
in
england
one
of
the
women
most
noted
for
medical
skill
was
lady
ann
halket
born
in
daughter
of
the
then
provost
of
eton
college
to
the
study
of
divinity
she
seems
to
have
taken
most
delight
in
those
of
physick
and
surgery
in
which
she
was
no
mean
proficient
nay
some
of
the
best
physicians
in
the
kingdom
did
not
think
themselves
slighted
when
persons
of
the
greatest
quality
did
consult
her
in
their
distempers
even
when
they
attended
them
as
their
ordinary
physicians
many
from
england
holland
and
the
remotest
parts
of
the
kingdom
have
sent
to
her
for
things
of
her
preparing
and
many
whose
diseases
have
proved
obstinate
under
all
the
methods
of
physicians
have
at
length
by
the
own
advice
been
recommended
and
sent
to
her
care
and
have
been
recovered
by
in
was
born
elizabeth
lawrence
afterwards
wife
of
the
rev
samuel
bury
of
bristol
who
wrote
her
life
and
who
bears
witness
that
was
not
possible
there
should
be
a
more
observant
tender
indulgent
and
compassionate
wife
than
she
was
a
more
sympathising
spirit
is
very
rarely
he
records
that
took
much
pleasure
in
anatomy
and
medicine
being
led
and
prompted
to
it
partly
by
her
own
ill
health
and
partly
with
a
desire
of
being
the
difficulties
that
she
encountered
in
her
studies
may
be
guessed
since
would
often
regret
that
so
many
learned
men
should
be
so
uncharitable
to
her
sex
and
be
so
loath
to
assist
their
feebler
faculties
when
they
were
anywise
disposed
to
an
accurate
search
into
things
profitable
and
curious
especially
as
they
would
all
so
readily
own
that
souls
were
not
distinguished
by
sexes
and
therefore
she
thought
it
would
have
been
an
honourable
pity
in
them
to
have
offered
something
in
condescension
to
their
capacities
rather
than
have
propagated
a
despair
of
their
information
to
future
her
husband
however
tells
us
that
improved
so
much
that
many
of
the
great
masters
of
the
faculty
have
often
been
startled
by
her
stating
the
most
nice
and
difficult
cases
in
such
proper
terms
and
remarking
that
much
knowledge
and
skill
soever
she
attained
in
the
practice
of
physick
by
long
observation
conversation
and
experience
yet
she
was
very
distrustful
of
herself
he
adds
that
the
of
her
successes
in
the
preservation
of
human
lives
were
not
easily
as
a
contemporary
of
these
englishwomen
we
find
in
germany
elizabeth
keillen
who
published
several
medical
works
and
died
in
she
is
said
by
finauer
to
have
had
knowledge
of
medicine
and
in
comparatively
recent
times
bologna
was
remarkable
as
ever
for
its
liberal
encouragement
of
learned
women
and
about
the
middle
of
the
last
century
the
chair
of
anatomy
at
that
university
was
filled
by
anna
morandi
mazzolini
whose
exquisitely
delicate
anatomical
models
executed
in
wax
became
the
pride
of
the
museum
at
bologna
she
first
became
interested
in
the
study
of
anatomy
in
consequence
of
her
wish
to
help
her
husband
who
was
a
distinguished
anatomist
and
a
maker
of
anatomical
designs
and
models
he
fell
into
and
mental
despondency
and
therefore
wife
loving
him
dearly
and
fearing
that
he
would
desist
from
his
work
gave
herself
up
to
his
comfort
and
for
this
purpose
became
herself
an
anatomical
sculptor
reading
works
of
anatomy
consulting
anatomical
tables
and
preparations
taking
theoretical
and
practical
lessons
from
her
husband
and
marvellous
to
say
even
dissecting
dead
bodies
with
resolute
mind
and
with
incredible
perseverance
too
long
to
describe
are
the
works
executed
in
wax
by
the
able
hands
of
this
illustrious
woman
they
were
collected
in
five
elegant
cases
in
our
anatomical
museum
the
fourth
case
encloses
delicate
illustrations
of
all
the
parts
belonging
to
the
senses
of
sight
smell
hearing
taste
and
touch
stupendous
works
in
which
she
surpassed
herself
and
also
her
husband
and
his
colleague
ercole
lelli
these
models
were
for
some
time
kept
in
her
own
house
and
each
one
who
saw
them
spread
her
renown
so
that
through
distant
countries
was
spread
the
fame
of
her
works
so
that
every
learned
and
distinguished
person
passing
through
bologna
was
solicitous
to
visit
and
know
personally
the
maker
of
these
signora
mazzolini
also
made
original
discoveries
in
anatomical
science
which
obtained
for
her
many
marks
of
distinction
from
the
learned
colleges
and
societies
of
the
day
she
was
offered
a
chair
at
milan
with
increased
revenues
but
preferred
to
remain
at
bologna
where
she
lived
till
her
death
in
medici
in
his
records
of
the
anatomical
school
of
bologna
speaks
of
this
lady
with
profound
respect
as
distinguished
alike
by
powers
great
erudition
gracious
manners
and
delicate
and
gentle
temperament
and
relates
that
her
fame
reached
the
ears
of
the
emperor
joseph
who
visited
her
in
and
seen
her
works
and
heard
her
conversation
loaded
her
with
public
honours
her
example
seems
to
have
inspired
others
of
her
countrywomen
to
follow
in
the
steps
of
one
so
honoured
alike
in
the
stern
duties
of
her
profession
and
in
the
sanctities
of
household
life
for
in
the
course
of
the
next
half
century
several
italian
women
availed
themselves
of
the
thorough
medical
education
which
the
italian
universities
never
refused
in
maria
petraccini
took
a
degree
in
medicine
at
florence
and
we
find
her
a
little
later
lecturing
on
anatomy
at
ferrara
in
presence
of
the
medical
professors
she
married
signor
feretti
and
has
left
several
works
on
the
physical
education
of
children
her
daughter
zaffira
feretti
seems
to
have
inherited
her
talents
for
she
studied
surgery
in
the
university
of
bologna
and
there
received
a
medical
degree
in
may
she
obtained
an
appointment
under
the
italian
government
and
for
some
time
lived
in
ancona
acting
as
of
the
midwives
in
all
parts
of
the
country
she
afterwards
went
to
turkey
and
died
at
patras
in
maria
mastellari
seems
also
to
have
been
a
woman
of
unusual
talent
and
diligently
in
the
most
rigid
she
obtained
a
medical
degree
at
bologna
in
she
subsequently
became
the
wife
of
signor

is
described
as
possessing
a
and
gentle
temperament
with
special
love
of
silence
and
quiet

centred
her
interests
in
her
family

additional

that

of

and

and
was
honoured
with
the
degree

from
the
university
of
marbourg
she
died
in
these
numerous
instances
of
the
successful
practice
of
medicine
by
women
seem
to
have
been
little
known
or
else
forgotten
to
judge
by
the
surprise
expressed
when
after
surmounting
many
difficulties
an
english
lady
named
elizabeth
blackwell
succeeded
in
obtaining
medical
education
and
the
degree
of
from
a
medical
school
in
america
in
the
novelty
in
truth
was
not
in
the
granting
of
the
medical
degree
to
a
woman
but
in
its
being
received
by
an
englishwoman
for
it
is
hardly
gratifying
to
national
pride
to
find
that
england
never
has
accorded
such
encouragement
to
female
learning
as
was
found
in
italy
germany
and
france
and
it
is
still
more
painful
to
realize
that
this
country
almost
alone
stands
still
aloof
from
the
movement
of
liberal
wisdom
that
has
now
in
all
these
lands
as
well
as
in
switzerland
and
even
in
russia
granted
to
woman
the
advantage
of
university
education
and
degrees
english
women
are
not
behind
others
in
desiring
knowledge
but
as
yet
they
are
forced
to
seek
it
on
foreign
shores
for
hitherto
no
british
university
has
ever
fully
admitted
women
to
its
educational
advantages
and
a
few
years
ago
that
of
london
with
all
its
professions
of
liberality
refused
a
petition
even
for
examination
for
the
degree
of
so
much
for
the
historical
evidence
bearing
on
this
question
i
am
indeed
sorry
to
have
paused
so
long
on
this
part
of
the
subject
but
it
seemed
essential
to
a
proper
statement
of
the
whole
case
if
then
nature
does
not
instinctively
forbid
the
practice
of
the
healing
art
by
women
and
if
it
can
not
be
denied
that
some
at
least
of
its
branches
have
long
been
in
their
hands
we
must
go
further
to
seek
on
what
grounds
their
admission
to
the
medical
profession
should
be
opposed
probably
the
next
argument
will
be
that
women
do
not
require
and
are
not
fitted
to
receive
the
scientific
education
needful
for
a
physician
and
that
their
own
it
is
not
desirable
that
they
should
pursue
some
of
the
studies
indispensably
necessary
to
this
the
answer
must
be
that
the
wisest
thinkers
teach
us
to
believe
that
each
human
being
must
be
law
unto
himself
and
must
decide
what
is
and
what
is
not
suitable
for
his
needs
what
will
and
what
will
not
contribute
to
his
own
development
and
fit
him
best
to
fulfil
the
most
congenial
to
his
tastes
if
women
claim
that
they
do
need
and
can
appreciate
instruction
in
any
or
all
sciences
i
do
not
know
who
has
the
right
to
deny
the
assertion
that
this
controversy
is
no
new
one
may
be
proved
by
reference
to
a
very
curious
volume
now
in
the
british
museum
wherein
the
writer
protests
mervayle
gretely
of
the
opynyon
of
some
men
that
say
they
wolde
not
in
no
wyse
that
theyr
doughters
or
wyves
or
kynneswomen
sholde
lerne
scyences
and
that
it
sholde
apayre
their
cödycyons
this
thing
is
not
to
say
ne
to
sustayne
that
the
woman
apayreth
by
connynge
it
is
not
well
to
beleve
as
the
proverbe
sayeth
nature
gyveth
maye
not
be
taken
if
it
be
argued
that
the
study
of
natural
science
may
injure
a
character
i
would
answer
in
the
words
of
one
of
the
women
i
know
that
a
womanliness
is
not
deep
enough
in
her
nature
to
bear
the
brunt
of
any
needful
education
it
is
not
worth
it
is
i
think
inconceivable
that
any
one
who
considers
the
study
of
natural
science
to
be
but
another
word
for
earnest
and
reverent
inquiry
into
the
works
of
god
and
who
believes
that
in
words
these
are
to
be
out
of
all
them
that
have
pleasure
therein
can
imagine
that
any
such
study
can
be
otherwise
than
elevating
and
helpful
to
the
moral
as
well
to
the
mental
nature
of
every
student
who
pursues
it
in
a
right
spirit
in
the
words
of
scripture
the
pure
all
things
are
pure
and
in
the
phrase
of
chivalry
soit
qui
mal
y
it
has
always
struck
me
as
a
curious
inconsistency
that
while
almost
everybody
applauds
and
respects
miss
nightingale
and
her
followers
for
their
brave
disregard
of
conventionalities
on
behalf
of
suffering
humanity
and
while
hardly
any
one
would
pretend
that
there
was
any
want
of
feminine
delicacy
in
their
going
among
the
foulest
sights
and
most
painful
scenes
to
succour
not
their
own
sex
but
the
other
many
people
yet
profess
to
be
shocked
when
other
women
desire
to
fit
themselves
to
take
the
medical
care
of
those
of
their
sisters
who
would
gladly
welcome
their
aid
where
is
the
real
difference
if
a
woman
is
to
be
applauded
for
facing
the
horrors
of
an
army
hospital
when
she
believes
that
she
can
there
do
good
work
why
is
she
to
be
condemned
as
indelicate
when
she
professes
her
willingness
to
go
through
an
ordeal
certainly
no
greater
to
obtain
the
education
necessary
for
a
medical
practitioner
surely
work
is
in
no
way
degraded
by
being
made
scientific
it
can
not
be
commendable
to
obey
instructions
as
a
nurse
when
it
would
be
unseemly
to
learn
the
reasons
for
them
as
a
student
or
to
give
them
as
a
doctor
more
especially
as
the
duties
may
lead
her
as
they
did
in
the
crimea
to
attend
on
men
with
injuries
and
diseases
of
all
kinds
whereas
the
woman
who
practises
as
a
physician
would
confine
her
practice
to
women
only
it
is
indeed
hard
to
see
any
reason
of
delicacy
at
least
which
can
be
adduced
in
favour
of
women
as
nurses
and
against
them
as
physicians
their
natural
capacity
for
the
one
sphere
or
the
other
is
of
course
a
wholly
different
matter
and
is
indeed
a
thing
not
to
be
argued
about
but
to
be
tested
if
women
fail
to
pass
the
required
examinations
for
the
ordinary
medical
degree
or
if
after
their
entrance
into
practice
they
fail
to
succeed
in
it
the
whole
question
is
naturally
and
finally
disposed
of
but
that
is
not
the
point
now
at
issue
that
the
most
thorough
and
scientific
medical
education
need
do
no
injury
to
any
woman
might
safely
be
prophesied
even
if
the
experiment
had
never
been
tried
but
we
have
moreover
the
absolute
confirmation
of
experience
on
the
point
as
i
for
one
will
gladly
testify
from
personal
acquaintance
in
america
with
many
women
who
have
made
medicine
their
profession
having
had
myself
the
advantage
of
studying
under
one
who
was
characterized
by
a
medical
gentleman
known
throughout
the
professional
world
as
of
the
best
physicians
in
boston
and
who
certainly
was
more
remarkable
for
thorough
refinement
of
mind
than
most
women
i
know
dr
lucy
sewall
of
course
there
may
always
be
unfortunate
exceptions
or
rather
there
will
always
be
those
of
both
sexes
who
whatever
their
profession
may
be
will
be
sure
to
disgrace
it
but
it
is
not
of
them
that
i
speak
nor
is
it
by
such
individual
cases
that
the
supporters
of
any
great
movement
should
be
judged
the
next
argument
usually
advanced
against
the
practice
of
medicine
by
women
is
that
there
is
no
demand
for
it
that
women
as
a
rule
have
little
confidence
in
their
own
sex
and
had
rather
be
attended
by
a
man
that
everybody
had
rather
be
attended
by
a
competent
physician
is
no
doubt
true
that
women
have
hitherto
had
little
experience
of
competent
physicians
of
their
own
sex
is
equally
true
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
the
education
bestowed
on
most
women
is
not
one
likely
to
inspire
much
confidence
it
is
probably
a
fact
that
until
lately
there
has
been
for
women
doctors
because
it
does
not
occur
to
most
people
to
demand
what
does
not
exist
but
that
very
many
women
have
wished
that
they
could
be
medically
attended
by
those
of
their
own
sex
i
am
very
sure
and
i
know
of
more
than
one
case
where
ladies
have
habitually
gone
through
one
confinement
after
another
without
proper
attendance
because
the
idea
of
employing
a
man
was
so
extremely
repugnant
to
them
i
have
indeed
repeatedly
found
that
even
doctors
not
altogether
favourable
to
the
present
movement
allow
that
they
consider
men
rather
out
of
place
in
midwifery
practice
and
an
eminent
american
practitioner
once
remarked
to
me
that
he
never
entered
a
room
to
attend
her
in
confinement
without
wishing
to
apologize
for
what
he
felt
to
be
an
intrusion
though
a
necessary
and
beneficent
intrusion
in
one
of
his
sex
i
suppose
that
the
real
test
of
is
not
in
the
opinions
expressed
by
those
women
who
have
never
even
seen
a
thoroughly
educated
female
physician
but
in
the
practice
which
flows
in
to
any
such
physician
when
her
qualifications
are
clearly
satisfactory
in
england
there
are
at
present
but
two
women
legally
qualified
to
practise
medicine
and
i
understand
that
already
their
time
is
much
more
fully
occupied
and
their
receipts
much
greater
than
is
usually
the
case
with
medical
men
who
have
been
practising
for
so
short
a
period
dr
garrett
dispensary
for
poor
women
is
also
largely
attended
and
during
the
five
years
which
have
elapsed
since
it
was
opened
more
than
visits
have
been
made
to
it
new
patients
have
been
admitted
and
midwifery
cases
have
been
attended
by
the
midwives
attached
to
the
charity
dr
garrett
anderson
being
called
in
when
necessary
when
we
turn
to
america
we
find
that
a
considerable
number
of
women
have
very
extensive
practice
and
large
professional
incomes
more
indeed
than
in
some
cases
seems
warranted
by
their
medical
qualifications
the
report
of
a
little
hospital
managed
entirely
by
women
in
boston
relates
that
during
the
number
of
was
of
persons
visited
at
their
homes
and
of
those
able
to
attend
at
the
dispensary
all
these
patients
being
women
and
children
only
in
fact
the
attendance
at
the
dispensary
became
so
excessive
in
proportion
to
the
resources
of
the
charity
that
in
a
rule
was
passed
by
the
committee
requiring
each
patient
to
pay
cents
or
about
ninepence
for
medicines
at
each
visit
except
when
she
brought
certificate
of
her
poverty
properly
this
regulation
brought
out
still
more
strongly
the
distinct
of
poor
women
in
this
matter
for
though
the
general
city
dispensary
gave
medicines
gratuitously
the
number
of
those
who
attended
at
the
hospital
was
much
less
diminished
than
was
expected
being
still
in
in
new
york
also
where
the
dispensary
managed
by
women
doctors
is
but
one
of
many
the
crowd
of
patients
is
very
great
the
numbers
being
in
no
less
than
while
persons
were
attended
at
their
homes
either
in
confinement
or
during
severe
illness
of
course
it
will
be
understood
that
each
patient
thus
entered
on
the
books
implies
not
one
visit
but
many
paid
to
the
dispensary
or
often
repeated
attendance
at
the
home
of
the
boston
hospital
for
women
and
children
i
can
speak
from
lengthened
experience
in
it
as
a
student
when
standing
in
its
dispensary
i
have
over
and
over
again
heard
rough
women
of
a
very
poor
class
say
when
questioned
why
they
had
not
had
earlier
treatment
for
certain
diseases
i
go
to
a
man
with
such
a
trouble
and
i
did
not
know
till
just
now
that
ladies
did
this
work
and
from
others
have
repeatedly
heard
different
expressions
of
the
feeling
that
so
nice
it
to
be
able
at
last
to
ask
ladies
about
such
things
as
i
am
alluding
to
my
own
experience
in
this
matter
i
may
perhaps
be
allowed
to
say
how
often
in
the
same
place
i
have
been
struck
with
the
advantages
attendant
on
the
medical
care
by
women
of
women
how
often
i
have
seen
cases
connected
with
stories
of
shame
or
sorrow
to
which
a
hand
could
far
most
fittingly
minister
and
where
sisterly
help
and
counsel
could
give
far
more
appropriate
succour
than
could
be
expected
from
the
average
young
medical
man
however
good
his
intentions
perhaps
we
shall
find
the
solution
of
some
of
our
saddest
social
problems
when
educated
and
women
are
brought
more
constantly
in
contact
with
their
sinning
and
suffering
sisters
in
other
relations
as
well
as
those
of
missionary
effort
so
far
from
there
being
no
demand
for
women
as
physicians
i
believe
that
there
is
at
this
moment
a
large
amount
of
work
actually
awaiting
them
that
a
large
amount
of
suffering
exists
among
women
which
never
comes
under
the
notice
of
medical
men
at
all
and
which
will
remain
unmitigated
till
women
are
ready
in
sufficient
numbers
to
attend
medically
to
those
of
their
own
sex
who
need
them
and
this
in
all
parts
of
the
world
from
india
we
hear
urgent
demands
for
native
women
of
good
caste
so
as
to
qualify
them
to
treat
female
patients
and
we
are
informed
that
is
a
work
which
can
only
be
carried
on
by
women
as
the
native
women
in
many
cases
will
rather
die
than
be
seen
by
a
man
in
times
of
sickness
and
arrangements
have
already
been
made
for
a
systematic
medical
mission
though
perhaps
the
standard
of
medical
knowledge
required
can
under
existing
circumstances
hardly
be
fixed
as
high
as
is
desirable
to
show
however
the
eagerness
with
which
the
native
women
avail
themselves
of
the
aid
thus
offered
i
may
mention
that
when
a
lady
who
had
had
some
medical
training
but
possessed
no
degree
was
sent
out
by
the
society
in
december
she
during
the
first
three
months
of
her
stay
had
occasion
to
pay
no
less
than
professional
visits
to
zenanas
and
to
treat
patients
at
her
dispensary
which
was
arranged
with
a
view
to
affording
them
the
utmost
privacy
subsequently
her
visits
to
zenanas
averaged
as
many
as
seventeen
a
day
while
nearly
twice
as
many
patients
came
to
her
dispensary
efforts
are
also
being
made
to
train
native
hindoo
women
for
some
branches
at
least
of
the
medical
profession
dr
corbyn
of
bareilly
in
wrote
as
follows
am
educating
a
number
of
native
girls
and
three
have
already
passed
as
native
doctors
they
are
of
all
castes
christians
mahommedans
and
hindoos
my
school
is
divided
into
three
classes
the
pupils
can
read
and
write
english
and
urdee
with
accuracy
they
are
taught
medicine
surgery
midwifery
diseases
of
women
and
children
especially
the
latter
two
the
learn
anatomy
materia
medica
and
physiology
in
english
and
urdee
the
pupils
of
the
other
preparatory
class
are
taught
english
and
urdee
we
have
a
female
ward
attached
to
the
dispensary
for
women
and
children
and
these
girls
entirely
attend
to
them
under
my
and
the
supervision
it
is
wonderful
how
they
can
manipulate
they
have
plenty
of
even
more
recently
we
learn
that
mahommedan
nawab
of
rampoor
has
presented
to
the
bareilly
mission
a
large
building
for
the
purpose
of
a
medical
school
for
women
several
women
are
now
going
through
a
scientific
course
of
about
eight
or
ten
years
ago
of
the
wild
tribes
of
russian
asia
petitioned
the
government
to
send
them
out
properly
qualified
women
to
act
as
midwives
their
petition
was
granted
the
government
undertaking
all
the
expense
of
the
education
and
maintenance
of
a
certain
number
of
women
for
this
purpose
after
a
time
one
of
these
tribes
the
kirgesen
petitioned
further
that
the
women
thus
sent
to
them
should
also
be
taught
some
branches
of
the
art
of
medicine
one
of
the
women
then
being
trained
as
a
midwife
hearing
of
this
petition
wrote
to
the
kirgesen
proposing
that
she
should
study
medicine
thoroughly
and
go
out
to
them
as
a
qualified
doctor
she
suggested
at
the
same
time
that
they
should
try
to
get
permission
for
her
to
enter
the
academy
of
st
petersburg
as
a
regular
medical
student
the
kirgesen
welcomed
the
proposal
and
through
an
influential
russian
general
obtained
an
official
document
empowering
their
future
doctor
to
attend
the
academy
as
a
student
they
have
regularly
sent
money
for
her
education
and
maintenance
and
from
the
first
have
taken
the
greatest
interest
in
her
progress
and
welfare
requiring
among
other
things
periodical
bulletins
of
her
health
hearing
last
summer
that
she
was
not
well
they
sent
money
for
her
to
go
abroad
for
her
holiday
and
asked
for
an
extra
i
cite
the
above
facts
to
show
that
the
demand
for
female
physicians
is
no
artificial
or
imaginary
one
and
that
it
does
not
spring
out
of
any
fanciful
whim
of
an
social
state
but
lest
it
should
be
supposed
on
the
other
hand
to
be
confined
to
nations
i
may
quote
the
opinions
expressed
on
this
subject
two
years
ago
in
one
of
the
most
thoughtful
of
our
english
journals
heartily
admit
that
the
only
way
to
discriminate
clearly
what
practical
careers
women
are
and
are
not
fitted
for
is
to
let
them
try
in
many
cases
as
in
the
medical
profession
we
do
not
feel
any
doubt
that
they
will
find
a
special
kind
of
work
for
which
they
are
specially
fitted
which
has
never
been
adequately
done
by
men
at
all
and
which
never
would
be
done
but
by
women
we
have
heard
the
opinion
of
one
of
the
most
eminent
of
our
living
physicians
that
one
of
the
new
lady
physicians
is
doing
in
the
most
admirable
manner
a
work
which
medical
men
would
never
even
have
had
the
chance
of
i
am
told
by
catholic
friends
that
a
great
many
cases
of
special
disease
remain
untreated
in
convents
because
the
nuns
with
their
extreme
notions
of
feminine
seclusion
think
that
it
would
be
little
short
of
profanation
to
submit
to
some
kinds
of
medical
treatment
from
a
man
indeed
it
is
expressly
laid
down
by
a
great
catholic
authority
st
alphonsus
that
though
monks
and
nuns
are
required
to
place
themselves
in
the
care
when
commanded
to
do
so
by
their
superiors
a
special
exception
is
to
be
made
in
the
case
of
nuns
suffering
from
certain
maladies
who
can
only
be
required
to
accept
treatment
from
a
skilled
woman
if
any
such
be
available
as
under
existing
circumstances
is
so
rarely
the
case
i
do
not
ask
any
reader
to
applaud
or
even
justify
these
poor
nuns
if
they
esteeming
themselves
martyrs
of
holy
purity
sacrifice
life
to
such
scruples
but
i
do
most
emphatically
ask
in
the
name
of
humanity
whether
the
state
of
things
can
be
defended
which
may
drive
women
from
the
highest
and
most
holy
motives
to
submit
to
the
extremity
of
physical
suffering
and
even
death
itself
because
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
obtain
the
medical
services
of
their
own
sex
and
because
they
believe
they
can
best
fulfil
the
spirit
of
their
vows
by
accepting
no
other
i
am
informed
by
a
friend
that
archbishop
manning
when
expressing
to
her
his
strong
interest
in
the
question
of
the
medical
education
of
women
alluded
to
facts
like
those
referred
to
above
as
affording
one
of
the
strongest
motives
for
such
interest
in
the
minds
of
catholics
nor
surely
need
sympathy
in
such
a
case
be
limited
within
the
bounds
of
any
religious
denomination
to
pass
to
the
consideration
of
other
cases
of
a
less
exceptional
kind
there
can
i
think
be
little
doubt
that
an
enormous
amount
of
preventible
suffering
arises
from
the
unwillingness
of
very
many
girls
on
the
verge
of
womanhood
to
consult
a
medical
man
on
various
points
which
are
yet
of
vital
importance
and
to
appeal
to
him
in
cases
of
apparently
slight
illness
which
yet
issue
but
too
often
in
ultimately
confirmed
i
firmly
believe
that
if
a
dozen
competent
women
entered
upon
medical
practice
at
this
moment
in
different
parts
of
england
they
might
without
withdrawing
a
single
patient
from
her
present
medical
attendant
find
full
and
remunerative
employment
in
attending
simply
to
those
cases
which
in
the
present
state
of
things
go
without
any
adequate
treatment
whatever
for
i
believe
that
many
suffering
women
would
be
willing
to
consult
one
of
their
own
sex
if
thoroughly
qualified
when
they
refuse
except
at
some
crisis
of
acute
suffering
to
call
in
a
medical
man
probably
queen
isabella
of
castile
was
neither
the
first
nor
the
last
woman
whose
life
was
sacrificed
to
her
modesty
even
if
such
extreme
instances
are
rare
i
think
it
can
not
be
denied
that
very
much
needless
pain
pain
of
a
kind
that
ought
not
to
be
inflicted
is
caused
especially
to
young
girls
by
the
necessity
of
consulting
men
on
all
occasions
and
i
believe
that
those
who
know
most
of
the
facts
insist
most
strongly
on
this
point
i
do
not
know
how
far
the
medical
profession
would
acknowledge
the
truth
of
the
above
statement
it
is
probable
that
they
are
really
less
competent
to
judge
about
it
than
women
are
themselves
for
as
an
eminent
divine
remarked
that
it
was
considered
a
point
of
politeness
not
to
express
theological
doubts
before
a
clergyman
it
may
probably
be
thought
still
more
obligatory
not
to
question
the
adequacy
of
the
existing
medical
profession
before
one
of
its
members
one
can
hardly
imagine
a
lady
sending
for
a
doctor
to
tell
him
why
she
will
consult
him
it
is
sufficient
to
know
that
many
cases
of
disease
among
women
go
without
treatment
it
is
surely
open
to
any
one
at
least
to
suggest
the
above
as
one
of
the
possible
reasons
and
indeed
if
no
such
special
suffering
were
often
involved
in
the
idea
of
consulting
a
man
on
all
points
it
seems
that
a
most
natural
adviser
would
be
one
of
her
own
sex
who
must
surely
be
most
able
to
understand
and
sympathise
with
her
in
times
of
sickness
as
well
as
of
health
and
who
can
often
far
more
fully
appreciate
her
state
both
of
mind
and
body
than
any
medical
man
would
be
likely
to
do
nor
can
i
leave
the
subject
without
expressing
a
hope
that
when
women
are
once
practising
medicine
in
large
numbers
great
gain
may
accrue
to
medical
science
from
the
observations
and
discoveries
which
their
sex
will
give
them
double
facilities
of
making
among
other
women
one
of
the
most
eminent
of
the
of
the
day
writes
principal
reason
why
the
knowledge
of
diseases
of
women
has
so
little
advanced
is
the
hitherto
undisturbed
belief
that
one
sex
only
is
qualified
by
education
and
powers
of
mind
to
investigate
and
to
cure
what
the
other
sex
alone
has
to
after
alluding
to
women
physicians
of
both
ancient
and
modern
times
dr
tilt
further
remarks
that
well
educated
they
may
greatly
improve
our
knowledge
of
the
diseases
of
moreover
there
is
reason
to
hope
that
women
doctors
may
do
even
more
for
the
health
of
their
own
sex
in
the
way
of
prevention
than
of
cure
and
surely
this
is
the
very
noblest
province
of
the
true
physician
already
it
is
being
proved
with
what
eagerness
women
will
attend
lectures
on
physiology
and
hygiene
when
delivered
to
them
by
a
woman
though
perhaps
not
one
in
ten
would
go
to
the
same
course
of
lectures
if
given
by
a
medical
man
i
look
forward
to
the
day
when
a
competent
knowledge
of
these
subjects
shall
be
as
general
among
women
as
it
now
is
rare
and
when
that
day
arrives
i
trust
that
the
which
is
now
so
sadly
common
in
our
sex
and
which
so
frequently
comes
from
sheer
ignorance
of
sanitary
laws
will
become
rather
the
exception
than
as
now
too
often
the
rule
i
hope
that
then
we
shall
find
far
fewer
instances
of
illness
entailed
on
herself
by
a
thoughtless
ignorance
i
believe
we
shall
see
a
generation
of
women
far
fitter
in
mind
and
body
to
take
their
share
in
the
work
of
the
world
and
that
the
registrar
will
have
to
record
a
much
lower
rate
of
infantile
mortality
when
mothers
themselves
have
learned
to
know
something
at
least
of
the
elementary
laws
of
health
it
has
been
well
said
that
the
noblest
end
of
education
is
to
make
the
educator
no
longer
necessary
and
i
at
least
shall
think
it
the
highest
proof
of
success
if
women
doctors
can
in
time
succeed
in
so
raising
the
standard
of
health
among
their
sister
women
that
but
half
the
present
percentage
of
medical
practitioners
are
required
in
comparison
to
the
female
population
of
course
i
do
not
expect
that
every
reader
will
look
at
this
question
from
my
point
of
view
or
will
be
able
to
arrive
at
the
same
conclusions
respecting
it
but
i
think
that
many
who
have
never
before
seen
the
matter
in
the
light
in
which
i
have
tried
to
place
it
will
be
ready
to
admit
that
there
are
at
any
rate
grounds
for
my
argument
and
that
allowing
even
for
considerable
on
my
part
there
may
still
remain
subject
for
serious
consideration
even
if
i
am
wholly
mistaken
and
if
all
that
needs
doing
in
england
be
effectually
done
by
men
we
have
still
i
think
no
reason
for
the
exclusion
of
women
from
the
medical
profession
there
is
still
no
ground
on
which
it
can
be
right
to
refuse
to
every
patient
the
power
of
election
between
a
physician
of
her
own
sex
and
of
the
other
when
women
as
well
as
men
are
desirous
of
qualifying
themselves
for
this
work
seeing
that
it
will
after
all
be
always
a
matter
of
choice
for
we
can
not
suppose
that
the
time
will
ever
come
when
women
will
be
arbitrarily
prevented
from
employing
men
as
they
now
are
arbitrarily
prevented
from
employing
women
as
their
medical
attendants
the
assertion
that
women
at
present
prevented
from
employing
women
as
their
medical
may
sound
startling
but
it
is
at
this
moment
practically
true
in
england
in
the
most
literal
sense
since
medical
practice
has
for
the
protection
of
the
public
been
made
a
matter
of
legislation
it
has
been
absolutely
illegal
for
any
physician
or
surgeon
to
practise
as
such
in
this
country
unless
registered
by
the
appointed
medical
board
and
that
board
is
not
obliged
to
register
any
one
who
has
not
a
british
medical
degree
it
is
evident
then
that
to
deny
all
british
medical
degrees
to
women
not
only
to
refuse
them
instruction
but
to
refuse
to
examine
them
if
they
have
acquired
knowledge
elsewhere
most
arbitrarily
to
prohibit
all
women
whatever
their
qualification
from
practising
medicine
in
the
united
kingdom
except
under
legal
pains
and
penalties
of
course
no
such
arbitrary
action
was
even
contemplated
when
the
act
of
was
passed
and
i
think
that
when
once
the
great
practical
injustice
of
the
present
state
of
things
is
fully
understood
by
the
public
a
change
is
inevitable
either
british
medical
degrees
will
be
thrown
open
to
women
as
is
most
desirable
or
the
legal
conditions
of
practice
will
be
modified
to
meet
the
case
of
those
to
whom
such
degrees
are
denied
it
is
perhaps
hardly
to
be
expected
though
very
much
to
be
desired
that
medical
men
as
a
body
should
themselves
take
the
initiative
in
this
matter
and
throw
open
the
doors
to
all
women
who
desire
worthily
to
join
their
fellowship
for
it
proverbially
good
men
to
give
up
their
own
monopoly
but
the
action
of
the
general
public
in
the
matter
can
hardly
be
doubtful
except
as
a
question
of
time
no
english
court
could
be
expected
to
condemn
to
legal
penalties
a
succession
of
ladies
who
may
have
seized
often
with
great
effort
every
opportunity
open
to
them
to
fit
themselves
thoroughly
for
a
work
which
they
believe
to
be
especially
their
own
the
recent
action
taken
in
the
matter
by
the
authorities
at
hall
is
exactly
of
the
kind
to
outrage
an
sense
of
fairness
and
therefore
is
sure
before
long
to
bring
its
own
redress
as
the
facts
may
not
be
thoroughly
understood
in
the
world
i
will
briefly
recapitulate
them
when
miss
garrett
first
began
to
study
medicine
in
she
tried
to
obtain
admittance
to
one
school
and
university
after
another
and
finally
found
that
hall
was
the
only
body
which
from
its
charter
had
no
power
to
refuse
to
examine
any
candidate
complying
with
its
conditions
she
accordingly
went
through
the
required
five
apprenticeship
and
obtained
her
diploma
in
having
gone
to
very
great
additional
expense
in
obtaining
privately
the
required
lectures
by
recognised
professors
sometimes
paying
fifty
guineas
for
a
course
when
the
usual
fee
in
the
classes
from
which
she
was
debarred
was
but
three
or
four
not
content
however
with
indirectly
imposing
this
enormous
pecuniary
tax
on
women
the
authorities
now
bethought
them
to
pass
a
rule
forbidding
students
to
receive
any
part
of
their
medical
education
privately
this
course
being
publicly
advised
by
one
of
the
leading
medical
journals
as
a
safe
way
of
evading
the
obligations
of
the
charter
and
yet
effectually
shutting
out
the
one
chance
left
to
the
women
of
course
the
efficacy
of
this
measure
ceases
the
moment
that
any
regular
medical
school
fairly
opens
its
doors
to
women
but
till
that
day
comes
it
presents
a
formidable
if
not
insuperable
difficulty
commenting
on
this
proceeding
the
remarks
recommend
these
facts
to
the
good
people
who
think
that
coercion
restriction
and
the
tyranny
of
combination
are
peculiar
to
any
one
class
of
society
it
will
be
a
great
day
in
england
when
the
right
of
every
individual
to
make
the
most
of
the
ability
which
god
has
given
him
free
from
interested
interference
is
recognised
and
to
that
goal
we
are
surely
advancing
but
our
progress
is
slow
and
it
is
very
clear
that
it
is
not
only
in
the
lower
ranks
of
the
community
that
the
obstructive
spirit
is
energetically
while
such
is
the
state
of
affairs
in
england
other
european
nations
have
taken
a
very
different
position
we
have
already
seen
that
the
italian
universities
were
in
fact
never
closed
to
women
and
that
at
bologna
no
less
than
three
women
held
chairs
in
the
medical
faculty
we
have
several
instances
of
degrees
granted
to
women
in
the
middle
ages
by
the
universities
of
bologna
padua
milan
pavia
and
others
the
earliest
instance
that
i
have
found
being
that
of
betisia
gozzadini
who
was
made
doctor
of
laws
by
the
university
of
bologna
in
in
germany
also
several
such
instances
have
occurred
at
paris
no
less
than
seven
degrees
in
arts
and
sciences
have
been
granted
to
women
by
the
university
of
france
within
the
last
ten
years
and
a
number
of
women
are
now
studying
in
the
medical
school
there
in
answer
to
my
enquiries
in
the

in
paris
after
passing
brilliant
examinations
in
each
case
the
first
graduate
was
our
distinguished
countrywoman
miss
garrett
who
after
passing
the
five
examinations
required
received
her
degree
in
june
the
records
that
friends
must
have
been
highly
gratified
to
hear
how
her
judges
congratulated
her
on
her
success
and
to
see
what
sympathy
and
respect
was
shown
to
her
by
all
the
next
lady
who
graduated
was
miss
mary
putnam
of
new
york
who
after
quietly
pursuing
her
studies
combined
with
original
researches
like
a
second
archimedes
during
both
the
sieges
of
paris
in
took
her
degree
with
great
honour
in
august
the
remarked
putnam
has
just
been
undergoing
the
very
strict
examinations
for
the
degree
in
paris
and
has
passed
very
creditably
this
is
the
second
case
in
the
paris
faculty
the
innovation
being
made
quietly
whilst
elsewhere
angry
discussions
at
lyons
also
two
women
have
obtained
degrees
in
arts
in
and
respectively
at
montpellier
a
degree
in
arts
was
also
conferred
on
a
woman
in
and
another
lady
has
passed
the
first
two
examinations
in
the
de
pharmacie
in
that
city
for
several
years
past
the
university
of
zurich
has
been
thrown
open
to
women
as
freely
as
to
men
a
russian
woman
named
nadejda
suslowa
being
the
first
to
obtain
a
degree
in
medicine
in
several
more
have
since
then
graduated
and
others
are
at
present
pursuing
their
studies
there
in
the
ordinary
classes
in
march
it
was
announced
on
the
authority
of
the
that
the
university
of
vienna
had
formally
decided
to
admit
women
as
students
and
to
confer
on
them
the
ordinary
medical
degrees
a
month
or
two
later
the
swedish
newspapers
published
in
their
official
columns
a
royal
decree
granting
to
swedish
women
the
right
to
study
and
practise
medicine
and
ordaining
that
the
professors
of
the
universities
should
make
arrangements
for
teaching
and
examining
them
in
the
usual
way
even
russia
seems
in
advance
of
england
in
this
matter
in
academy
of
st
petersburg
conferred
the
degree
of
upon
madame
kaschewarow
the
first
female
candidate
for
this
honour
when
her
name
was
mentioned
by
the
dean
it
was
received
with
an
immense
storm
of
applause
which
lasted
for
several
minutes
the
ceremony
of
investing
her
with
the
insignia
of
her
dignity
being
over
her
and
colleagues
lifted
her
upon
a
chair
and
carried
her
with
triumphant
shouts
through
the
at
moscow
also
faculty
of
medicine
with
the
full
concurrence
of
the
council
of
the
university
of
moscow
have
decided
to
grant
to
women
the
right
of
being
present
at
the
educational
courses
and
lectures
of
the
faculty
and
to
follow
all
the
labours
of
the
academy
the
tests
of
capacity
will
be
precisely
the
same
as
for
male
still
more
recently
we
hear
from
st
petersburg
that
success
of
the
lady
physicians
is
encouraging
other
ladies
to
devote
themselves
to
medicine
and
a
considerable
step
has
been
made
in
this
direction
a
person
who
interests
herself
in
the
higher
education
of
women
has
requested
the
minister
of
state
to
accept
the
sum
of
and
to
devote
it
to
the
establishment
of
medical
classes
for
women
at
the
imperial
academy
of
nor
is
the
progress
of
liberality
less
marked
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
it
is
well
known
that
several
of
the
smaller
medical
schools
in
the
united
states
admitted
women
as
soon
as
they
applied
for
instruction
but
until
no
american
university
threw
open
its
doors
about
the
end
of
that
year
however
the
state
university
of
michigan
took
the
initiative
in
this
matter
and
the
following
statement
was
inserted
in
last
official
calendar
the
equality
of
rights
of
both
sexes
to
the
highest
educational
advantages
the
board
of
regents
have
made
provision
for
the
medical
education
of
women
by
authorising
a
course
of
education
for
them
separate
but
in
all
respects
equal
to
that
heretofore
given
to
men
only
the
conditions
of
admission
as
well
as
graduation
are
the
same
for
during
the
first
year
fourteen
women
appeared
as
students
in
the
faculty
of
arts
three
in
that
of
law
and
thirteen
were
studying
medicine
and
surgery
in
the
spring
of
miss
sanford
received
the
first
medical
degree
granted
to
a
woman
by
an
american
university
and
it
is
worth
notice
that
this
lady
herself
a
pupil
of
dr
lucy
sewall
of
boston
took
her
place
among
the
most
distinguished
graduates
of
the
year
her
thesis
on
being
the
one
selected
by
the
medical
faculty
for
publication
the
number
of
women
studying
at
michigan
university
during
the
session
was
as
compared
with
the
thirty
of
the
previous
year
such
rapid
increase
being
tolerably
significant
of
the
avidity
with
which
women
embrace
the
opportunities
of
instruction
and
offering
sufficient
encouragement
to
any
british
university
that
may
resolve
to
try
the
same
experiment
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
many
nations
have
from
the
earliest
period
recognised
and
acted
upon
the
truth
that
is
of
no
sex
and
that
where
this
has
not
been
the
case
in
former
times
the
barriers
are
being
rapidly
and
readily
thrown
down
as
civilization
advances
till
in
truth
great
britain
now
stands
almost
alone
in
refusing
to
admit
her
daughters
to
the
national
universities
and
in
denying
them
the
opportunity
of
proving
experimentally
whether
male
mind
of
the
caucasian
race
is
indeed
so
immeasurably
superior
to
its
feminine
counterpart
it
may
be
remarked
by
the
bye
that
it
is
very
curious
to
notice
how
the
very
people
who
loudly
maintain
the
existence
of
this
vast
mental
disparity
are
just
those
who
strenuously
resist
every
endeavour
to
submit
their
theory
to
the
touchstone
of
experience
instead
of
welcoming
the
application
of
those
tests
that
might
be
expected
so
triumphantly
to
prove
their
point
but
jesting
apart
the
present
state
of
things
can
hardly
be
agreeable
to
english
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
our
country
will
soon
descend
from
her
bad
eminence
and
no
longer
be
marked
out
as
the
one
land
where
men
only
can
reap
benefit
from
the
educational
advantages
provided
at
the
expense
of
the
nation
at
large
it
can
hardly
be
an
object
of
ambition
to
the
learned
men
of
any
people
to
deserve
the
woe
pronounced
of
old
against
those
who
taken
away
the
key
of
knowledge
and
them
that
were
entering
in
they
there
seems
to
be
practically
no
doubt
now
that
women
are
and
will
be
doctors
the
only
question
really
remaining
is
how
thoroughly
they
are
to
be
educated
and
fitted
to
take
their
share
of
responsibility
in
the
care
of
the
life
and
health
of
the
nation
how
far
their
difficulties
are
to
be
lightened
or
increased
and
whether
the
state
of
things
shall
continue
by
which
they
are
driven
into
unwilling
quackery
on
the
one
hand
or
made
to
suffer
real
oppression
from
irresponsible
authority
on
the
other
men
who
after
an
irregular
education
and
incomplete
training
claim
the
name
of
physicians
are
justly
stigmatised
as
quacks
and
excluded
from
honourable
fellowship
for
they
have
refused
the
straight
and
direct
path
as
too
laborious
and
have
sought
admittance
by
crooked
ways
it
is
right
enough
to
impose
heavy
penalties
on
them
for
practising
without
a
diploma
which
it
needs
only
industry
on
their
part
to
obtain
but
what
shall
we
say
when
women
are
refused
admission
to
every
regular
medical
school
and
then
when
they
have
perhaps
painfully
and
laboriously
gathered
their
own
education
either
in
england
or
abroad
are
excluded
from
the
fellowship
of
the
profession
for
the
sin
of
having
been
unjustly
treated
that
some
women
have
succeeded
in
acquiring
most
competent
medical
knowledge
and
skill
can
hardly
be
denied
except
by
those
who
really
know
nothing
of
the
facts
or
are
wilfully
blind
to
them
but
in
almost
every
case
they
have
done
so
at
a
cost
of
money
effort
and
personal
sacrifice
that
can
be
expected
only
from
the
few
imagine
all
medical
students
met
by
the
difficulties
which
female
students
must
encounter
how
many
properly
educated
doctors
should
we
have
many
persons
however
who
would
gladly
see
women
engage
in
the
practice
of
medicine
yet
think
it
undesirable
that
they
should
obtain
their
education
in
the
same
schools
as
men
and
here
another
practical
point
arises
for
consideration
if
it
is
indeed
true
that
no
one
is
fit
for
the
profession
of
medicine
unless
able
to
banish
from
its
practice
the
personal
idea
of
sex
it
certainly
seems
as
if
all
earnest
students
seeking
the
same
knowledge
for
the
same
ends
ought
to
be
able
to
pursue
their
studies
together
we
are
constantly
told
and
i
think
rightly
that
no
woman
object
when
necessary
to
consult
a
medical
man
on
any
point
because
the
physician
will
see
in
it
simply
an
impersonal
and
will
from
his
scientific
standpoint
practically
ignore
all
that
would
be
embarrassing
as
between
persons
of
opposite
sexes
if
this
is
and
ought
to
be
true
it
does
not
seem
too
much
to
demand
equal
delicacy
of
feeling
among
those
who
will
in
a
year
or
two
be
themselves
physicians
and
from
personal
experience
when
studying
in
large
american
hospitals
with
students
of
both
sexes
i
believe
that
no
serious
difficulty
need
ever
occur
except
in
cases
of
really
exceptional
coarseness
of
character
on
one
side
or
the
other
that
such
joint
study
will
be
for
the
first
few
days
novel
and
embarrassing
is
of
course
natural
but
i
believe
that
as
the
first
novelty
wears
off
the
embarrassment
too
will
disappear
in
the
interest
of
a
common
study
and
that
no
thoroughly
woman
with
an
ordinary
amount
of
tact
need
ever
fear
such
association
with
students
of
whom
the
majority
will
always
be
gentlemen
it
is
of
course
a
radically
different
thing
to
study
any
or
all
subjects
with
earnest
scientific
interest
and
to
discuss
them
lightly
in
common
conversation
not
only
in
america
has
the
system
of
joint
education
been
tried
but
at
paris
and
at
zurich
ladies
are
at
the
present
moment
studying
in
the
regular
medical
schools
and
friends
at
each
place
assure
me
of
the
complete
success
of
the
experiment
if
such
it
is
considered
dr
mary
putnam
the
first
lady
ever
admitted
to
the
parisian
medical
school
in
wrote
thus
is
not
the
slightest
restriction
on
my
studies
or
my
presence
at
the
classes
i
have
never
found
the
slightest
difficulty
in
studying
with
the
young
men
with
whom
i
am
associated
not
only
at
lectures
but
in
the
hospitals
laboratory
i
have
always
been
treated
with
a
courtesy
at
once
frank
and
a
lady
studying
medicine
at
the
university
of
michigan
in
wrote
are
very
much
pleased
with
the
way
in
which
we
have
been
received
here
both
by
professors
and
students
they
have
treated
us
in
every
respect
with
great
another
lady
when
studying
at
zurich
reported
that
the
medical
school
of
zurich
no
advantage
which
is
afforded
to
the
male
students
is
denied
to
the
women
every
class
is
open
to
them
and
they
work
side
by
side
with
the
men
the
students
have
invariably
been
to
me
most
friendly
helpful
and
in
answer
to
an
official
letter
of
enquiry
the
dean
of
the
medical
faculty
at
zurich
wrote
ladies
have
been
regularly
admitted
as
matriculated
students
and
have
been
allowed
all
the
privileges
of
as
far
as
our
experience
has
gone
the
new
practice
has
not
in
any
way
been
found
to
damage
the
interests
of
the
university
the
lady
students
we
have
hitherto
had
have
all
been
found
to
behave
with
great
good
taste
and
to
be
diligent
such
evidence
must
surely
carry
more
weight
than
the
opinions
of
those
who
merely
theorize
about
probabilities
especially
when
such
theorists
start
as
is
often
the
case
with
a
predisposition
to
find
in
the
if
the
admission
of
women
to
the
regular
medical
schools
has
been
proved
to
bring
no
evil
consequences
wherever
teachers
and
professors
have
shown
good
will
it
needs
strong
arguments
to
justify
their
exclusion
from
advantages
which
they
can
hardly
obtain
elsewhere
for
it
has
been
well
remarked
that
nothing
can
be
more
false
than
to
confound
a
with
to
a
small
it
is
simply
a
mockery
and
one
calculated
to
mislead
the
public
when
a
medical
journal
announces
that
would
offer
no
obstacle
to
any
steps
which
women
may
think
would
be
conducive
to
their
own
benefit
but
if
it
be
indispensable
that
they
should
study
anatomy
and
medicine
let
them
in
the
interests
of
common
decency
have
an
educational
institution
and
licensing
body
of
their
and
again
women
are
determined
to
become
medical
practitioners
they
are
at
perfect
liberty
to
do
so
but
it
is
only
consistent
with
decency
that
they
should
have
their
own
special
schools
and
examining
such
writers
know
perfectly
well
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
two
or
three
struggling
women
students
to
found
own
special
schools
though
when
a
sufficient
number
of
women
are
educated
they
may
gladly
make
such
provision
for
those
who
will
succeed
them
and
that
if
in
truth
women
as
well
as
men
have
a
right
to
claim
opportunities
of
education
the
duty
of
providing
separate
instruction
for
them
clearly
falls
on
the
existing
schools
if
the
authorities
refuse
to
admit
them
to
share
in
the
general
advantages
offered
for
myself
i
can
not
see
why
difficulties
that
have
in
france
and
switzerland
been
proved
chimerical
should
in
england
be
supposed
without
any
fair
trial
to
be
insurmountable
as
i
for
one
can
not
believe
that
less
good
and
gentlemanly
feeling
should
be
expected
from
english
and
scotch
students
wherever
their
professors
set
them
an
example
of
courtesy
than
is
found
among
the
undergraduates
of
foreign
universities
but
this
is
a
point
which
i
do
not
greatly
care
to
urge
although
medical
science
can
undoubtedly
be
most
favourably
studied
under
those
conditions
which
only
large
institutions
can
command
and
which
could
for
many
years
be
but
imperfectly
attained
in
a
medical
college
designed
for
women
only
still
there
is
no
doubt
that
women
thoroughly
in
earnest
and
with
a
certain
amount
of
means
at
their
command
obtain
adequate
medical
instruction
without
entering
any
of
the
existing
schools
for
men
and
no
doubt
arrangements
could
be
made
to
secure
all
that
is
necessary
with
much
less
effort
and
expense
than
at
present
we
should
be
very
thankful
to
have
the
medical
schools
thrown
open
to
us
to
be
allowed
some
share
in
the
noble
provision
made
chiefly
with
public
money
for
the
instruction
of
medical
students
but
this
is
not
absolutely
indispensable
we
may
be
refused
this
and
yet
gain
our
end
though
with
greater
toil
and
at
greater
expense
as
time
goes
on
and
as
the
number
of
women
attracted
by
the
study
of
medicine
increases
it
will
probably
apart
from
all
extrinsic
considerations
be
both
natural
and
convenient
that
they
should
have
a
medical
school
of
their
own
in
which
every
means
of
study
should
be
specially
provided
for
and
adapted
to
their
needs
it
is
not
however
i
think
desirable
that
this
should
be
done
until
the
number
of
students
is
sufficient
to
guarantee
funds
for
the
liberal
payment
of
teachers
and
the
ample
provision
of
all
needful
facilities
if
no
women
are
to
be
made
competent
physicians
till
they
have
a
school
of
their
own
there
never
will
be
any
at
all
for
those
who
broadly
oppose
the
movement
will
always
be
able
to
say
have
never
proved
that
they
can
use
such
advantages
as
will
be
thus
furnished
do
not
establish
a
college
for
them
till
they
so
the
double
argument
would
run
thus
not
found
a
female
medical
school
till
we
are
sure
that
women
can
successfully
study
medicine
do
not
let
any
woman
study
medicine
except
in
a
medical
school
of
their
between
such
a
scylla
and
charybdis
who
can
steer
clear
supposing
however
that
this
dilemma
were
escaped
and
that
adequate
means
of
instruction
were
provided
with
men
or
apart
from
them
i
care
not
it
would
still
i
think
be
essential
not
only
to
the
interests
of
women
doctors
but
to
those
of
the
public
at
large
that
the
standard
for
medical
practitioners
of
both
sexes
should
be
identical
that
women
should
be
admitted
to
the
examinations
already
established
for
men
and
should
receive
their
medical
degree
on
exactly
the
same
terms
i
do
not
for
a
moment
desire
to
see
degrees
granted
to
women
by
a
college
of
their
own
or
to
see
a
special
examination
instituted
for
them
for
there
would
be
extreme
difficulty
in
measuring
the
exact
value
of
any
such
diplomas
and
danger
would
arise
on
the
one
hand
of
injustice
being
done
to
those
thoroughly
competent
but
possessing
a
degree
and
on
the
other
of
the
standard
being
really
lowered
and
the
medical
degree
coming
to
possess
an
uncertain
and
inferior
value
of
this
latter
danger
we
have
abundant
warning
in
america
where
every
fresh
college
is
allowed
the
right
of
its
own
students
on
whatever
terms
it
pleases
and
where
indeed
one
is
confounded
by
the
innumerable
diplomas
granted
by
all
sorts
of
colleges
to
all
sorts
of
people
so
that
one
has
need
to
inquire
whether
the
attached
to
a
name
represents
a
degree
granted
by
some
or
college
of
mushroom
growth
or
by
the
universities
of
harvard
and
yale
we
can
not
wish
for
such
a
state
of
things
in
england
let
british
degrees
continue
to
be
of
perfectly
definite
value
make
the
conditions
as
stringent
as
you
please
but
let
them
be
such
as
are
attainable
by
all
students
and
are
clearly
understood
by
the
general
public
and
then
for
all
that
would
worthily
win
and
wear
the
desired
honours
fair
field
and
no
is
there
not
one
of
the
english
scotch
or
irish
universities
that
will
win
future
laurels
by
now
taking
the
lead
generously
and
announcing
its
willingness
to
cease
at
least
its
policy
of
arbitrary
exclusion
let
the
authorities
if
they
please
admit
women
to
study
in
the
ordinary
classes
with
or
without
any
special
restrictions
and
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
at
least
the
greater
part
of
the
lectures
could
not
be
attended
in
common
or
let
them
if
they
think
needful
bid
the
women
make
their
own
arrangements
and
gather
their
knowledge
as
they
can
with
this
promise
only
that
when
acquired
such
knowledge
shall
be
duly
tested
and
if
found
worthy
shall
receive
the
of
the
regular
medical
degree
surely
this
is
not
too
much
to
ask
and
no
more
is
absolutely
essential
if
indeed
the
assertions
so
often
made
about
the
incapacity
of
women
are
true
the
result
of
such
examinations
which
may
be
both
theoretical
and
practical
scientific
and
clinical
will
triumphantly
prove
the
point
if
the
examinations
are
left
in
the
hands
of
competent
men
we
may
be
very
sure
that
all
unqualified
women
will
be
summarily
rejected
as
indeed
it
is
to
be
desired
that
they
should
be
if
on
the
contrary
some
women
however
few
can
under
all
existing
disadvantages
successfully
pass
the
ordeal
and
go
forth
with
the
full
authority
of
the
degree
of
doctor
of
medicine
surely
all
will
be
glad
to
welcome
their
perhaps
unexpected
success
and
bid
every
such
woman

she
sets

her

subjoin
as
a
curiosity
the
quaint
version
of
this
story
that
is
given
in
a
letter
from
mrs
celleor
a
fashionable
midwife
of
the
reign
of
james
ii
published
in
and
now
to
be
found
in
the
british
museum
after
saying
that
the
subtile
athenians
a
law
at
one
time
forbade
women
to
study
or
practise
medicine
or
physick
on
pain
of
death
which
law
continued
some
time
during
which
many
women
perished
both
in
and
by
private
diseases
their
modesty
not
permitting
them
to
admit
of
men
either
to
deliver
or
cure
them
she
continues
god
stirred
up
the
spirit
of
agnodice
a
noble
maid
to
pity
the
miserable
condition
of
her
own
sex
and
hazard
her
life
to
help
them
which
to
enable
herself
to
do
she
apparelled
her
like
a
man
and
became
the
scholar
of
hierophilos
the
most
learned
physician
of
the
time
and
having
learned
the
art
she
found
out
a
woman
that
had
long
languished
under
private
diseases
and
made
proffer
of
her
service
to
cure
her
which
the
sick
person
refused
thinking
her
to
be
a
man
but
when
agnodice
discovered
that
she
was
a
maid
the
woman
committed
herself
into
her
hands
who
cured
her
perfectly
and
after
her
many
others
with
the
like
skill
and
industry
so
that
in
a
short
time
she
became
the
successful
and
beloved
physician
of
the
whole
when
her
sex
became
known
to
the
public
was
like
to
be
condemned
to
death
for
transgressing
the
law
which
coming
to
the
ears
of
the
noble
women
they
ran
before
the
areopagites
and
the
house
being
encompassed
by
most
women
of
the
city
the
ladies
entered
before
the
judges
and
told
them
they
would
no
longer
account
them
for
husbands
and
friends
but
for
cruel
enemies
that
condemned
her
to
death
who
restored
to
them
their
health
protesting
they
would
all
die
with
her
if
she
were
put
to
death
this
caused
the
magistrates
to
disannul
the
law
and
make
another
which
gave
gentlewomen
leave
to
study
and
practise
all
parts
of
physick
to
their
own
sex
giving
large
stipends
to
those
that
did
it
well
and
carefully
and
there
were
many
noble
women
who
studied
that
practice
and
taught
it

the

from
a
popular
magazine
of
thirty
years

is
a
profession
nearly
altogether
wrested
out
of
the
hands
of
women
for
which
nature
has
surely
fitted
them
if
opinion
permitted
education
to
finish
work
but
women
are
held
in
the
bonds
of
ignorance
and
then
pronounced
of
deficient
capacity
or
blamed
for
wanting
the
knowledge
they
are
sternly
prevented
from
june
april
and
may
june
it
will
be
remembered
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
throw
doubt
on
the
birth
of
this
prince
but
dr
aveling
remarks
that
chamberlen
in
his
letter
to
the
princess
sophia
showed
the
absurdity
of
this
of
the
charge
of
conspiracy
had
in
those
days
so
far
the
ascendancy
that
the
obstetrical
art
was
principally
practised
by
females
and
on
this
occasion
the
queen
was
delivered

mrs

urgent

this
feeling
not
long

i
was
attacked
in

for
having
alluded
to
this
subject
and
a
certain
doctor
published
three
letters
in
one
week
to
prove
that
out
of
every
hundred
englishwomen
suffering
from
female
diseases
freely
consulted
medical
during
that
very
week
no
less
than
three
women
in
different
classes
of
society
appealed
to
me
for
advice
and
treatment
for
sufferings
about
which
they
not
like
to
ask
a
in
each
case
i
advised
them
to
consult
a
medical
man
as
i
was
not
yet
myself
in
practice
and
there
were
no
women
doctors
in
edinburgh
but
in
each
case
i
found
that
their
feeling
in
the
matter
was
too
strong
to
allow
them
to
do

silent
starting
then
with
the
assumption
that
women
may
with
profit
to
themselves
and
to
the
community
become
practitioners
of
medicine
it
is
clear
that
they
must
in
the
first
place
secure
such
an
education
as
shall
make
them
thoroughly
competent
to
take
their
share
of
responsibility
in
the
care
of
the
national
health
and
secondly
that
they
must
obtain
this
education
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
prescribed
by
authority
so
that
they
may
be
recognised
by
the
state
as
having
conformed
to
all
its
legal
requirements
and
may
practise
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
with
other
qualified
practitioners
it
is
essential
to
the
thorough
comprehension
of
this
last
point
that
the
laws
regulating
medical
practice
in
this
country
should
be
clearly
understood
as
these
can
never
be
lost
sight
of
by
those
who
are
engaged
in
the
battle
which
we
are
now
waging
and
i
will
before
proceeding
further
endeavour
to
state
clearly
the
provisions
of
the
medical
act
of
for
the
protection
of
the
public
against
ignorant
and
mischievous
quacks
the
act
provided
that
no
person
should
be
recognised
as
a
practitioner
of
medicine
in
the
united
kingdom
unless
registered
in
a
register
appointed
to
be
kept
for
that
purpose
the
act
provided
that
all
persons
possessing
the
degree
of
from
any
foreign
or
colonial
university
and
already
practising
in
this
country
at
the
date
of
the
passing
of
the
act
should
be
entitled
to
be
so
registered
but
that
with
this
exception
and
a
curious
one
in
favour
of
those
on
whom
the
doctorate
had
been
conferred
by
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
no
medical
practitioners
could
demand
registration
unless
holding
a
licence
diploma
or
degree
granted
by
one
of
the
british
examining
boards
specified
in
the
schedule
attached
to
the
act
it
is
of
course
that
these
provisions
were
intended
solely
to
defend
the
public
against
incompetent
practitioners
and
though
it
is
perhaps
to
be
regretted
that
the
act
did
not
expressly
require
the
medical
council
to
examine
and
on
proof
of
competency
to
register
the
holders
of
foreign
diplomas
and
all
others
who
had
pursued
a
regular
course
of
medical
study
it
could
not
be
anticipated
that
any
great
injustice
would
be
done
by
the
omission
of
any
such
a
clause
and
still
less
assuredly
was
it
intended
by
this
act
to
secure
to
one
sex
a
monopoly
of
all
medical
practice
but
at
the
present
moment
it
is
certain
that
great
danger
exists
that
the
act
may
be
wrested
from
its
original
purpose
and
made
an
almost
insurmountable
barrier
to
the
admission
of
women
to
the
authorised
practice
of
medicine
and
this
because
the
act
as
it
at
present
stands
makes
it
obligatory
on
all
candidates
to
comply
with
certain
conditions
and
yet
leaves
it
in
the
power
of
the
medical
schools
collectively
arbitrarily
to
preclude
women
from
such
compliance
the
following
clauses
of
the
act
of
will
show
the
absolute
necessity
that
now
exists
for
the
registration
of
all
practitioners
of
respectability

the
words

or

or
any
words
importing
a
person

by
law
as
a
medical
practitioner
or
member
of
the
medical
profession

used
in
any

of
parliament

be
construed
to

of

or

which
he
shall
have

prescribed
and

he
shall
prove
upon
the

that

is

no

in

or
that

hereafter
be

law
as
a
physician
or
surgeon
shall
upon
a
summary
conviction
for
any
such
offence
pay
a
sum
not
exceeding
twenty
it
is
then
sufficiently
plain
that
any
doctor
practising
in
this
country
without
the
required
registration
not
only
places
himself
in
the
position
of
a
quack
and
a
charlatan
but
actually
incurs
legal
penalties
for
assuming
medical
titles
however
fairly
they
may
have
been
won
in
the
most
eminent
of
foreign
universities
it
is
therefore
clear
that
it
becomes
a
quâ
that
any
women
desiring
to
practise
medicine
in
this
country
should
obtain
their
education
in
such
a
way
as
will
entitle
them
to
demand
registration
there
are
at
this
moment
two
englishwomen
whose
names
appear
on
the
register
as
legally
qualified
medical
practitioners
and
it
may
be
necessary
for
me
now
to
explain
how
they
came
respectively
to
attain
this
position
and
how
it
happens
that
no
more
women
are
able
to
avail
themselves
of
the
means
that
were
open
to
them
though
several
english
ladies
are
recorded
in
history
as
having
studied
medical
science
i
am
not
aware
that
any
of
our
ever
graduated
in
medicine
before
the
year
when
miss
elizabeth
blackwell
after
surmounting
many
difficulties
obtained
the
degree
of
from
a
college
in
the
state
of
new
york
returning
subsequently
to
england
she
took
advantage
of
the
clause
in
the
act
of
which
i
have
already
mentioned
and
demanded
and
obtained
registration
in
the
british
register
but
the
clause
referred
to
was
as
i
have
explained
retrospective
only
and
no
one
can
now
obtain
an
american
degree
and
in
virtue
of
it
claim
registration
in
this
country
this
being
the
case
when
in
the
year
miss
garrett
resolved
to
begin
the
study
of
medicine
with
a
view
to
practising
in
england
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
obtain
her
education
under
the
auspices
of
some
one
of
the
medical
corporations
empowered
to
give
registrable
qualifications
after
trying
in
vain
to
obtain
admission
to
one
school
and
college
after
another
she
finally
found
entrance
at
hall
which
was
from
its
charter
taken
as
i
suppose
in
conjunction
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
incapable
of
refusing
to
examine
any
candidate
who
complied
with
its
conditions
of
study
in
order
to
observe
the
regulations
of
hall
she
was
obliged
to
attend
the
lectures
of
certain
specified
teachers
and
though
she
was
in
some
cases
admitted
to
the
ordinary
classes
in
others
she
was
compelled
to
pay
very
heavy
fees
for
separate
and
private
tuition
by
the
recognised
lecturers
she
had
also
considerable
difficulty
in
obtaining
adequate
hospital
teaching
though
there
was
in
truth
hardly
the
slightest
difference
between
the
advantages
she
needed
and
those
now
habitually
accorded
to
lady
probationers
and
trained
nurses
who
are
constantly
present
with
the
ordinary
students
at
the
bedside
and
in
the
operating
theatre
she
obtained
admission
however
to
the
middlesex
hospital
and
might
i
suppose
have
studied
there
as
long
as
she
pleased
had
she
not
been
unfortunate
enough
to
acquit
herself
too
well
in
some
of
the
examinations
in
which
she
took
part
with
the
male
students
thus
arousing
their
manly
wrath
which
showed
itself
in
a
request
that
she
should
be
required
to
leave
the
hospital
and
this
noble
and
magnanimous
application
was
actually
granted
she
however
completed
her
studies
elsewhere
and
especially
at
the
london
hospital
being
it
is
to
be
presumed
too
discreet
to
enter
again
on
the
field
of
competition
thus
at
length
she
obtained
her
education
and
in
received
the
licence
to
practise
from
hall
which
enabled
her
to
place
her
name
upon
the
british
register
but
no
sooner
had
she
thus
demonstrated
the
existence
of
at
least
a
postern
gate
by
which
women
might
enter
the
profession
than
the
authorities
took
alarm
and
with
the
express
object
of
preventing
other
women
from
following
so
terrible
a
precedent
a
rule
was
passed
forbidding
students
henceforth
to
receive
any
part
of
their
education
privately
it
being
well
known
that
women
would
be
rigorously
excluded
from
some
at
least
of
the
public
classes
as
then
the
different
doors
by
which
the
two
ladies
entered
the
profession
of
medicine
were
both
closed
after
them
it
is
evident
that
when
three
years
ago
i
looked
round
for
the
means
of
obtaining
medical
education
in
this
country
it
was
necessary
that
some
new
way
should
be
devised
it
is
true
that
in
several
of
the
european
universities
women
were
at
that
moment
studying
medicine
indeed
i
am
not
aware
that
any
of
the
italian
french
or
german
universities
have
ever
been
closed
against
women
who
applied
for
admission
i
might
no
doubt
have
obtained
at
the
de
in
paris
a
medical
education
at
least
equal
and
in
some
respects
probably
superior
to
anything
that
this
country
affords
and
at
the
university
of
zurich
also
a
considerable
number
of
women
have
for
some
years
been
receiving
an
excellent
medical
education
but
it
seemed
to
me
radically
unjust
and
most
discreditable
to
great
britain
that
all
her
daughters
who
desired
a
university
education
should
be
driven
abroad
to
seek
it
only
a
small
number
of
women
could
be
expected
thus
to
expatriate
themselves
and
those
who
did
so
would
have
to
incur
the
great
additional
difficulty
and
disadvantage
of
studying
all
the
departments
of
medical
science
in
a
foreign
language
and
under
teachers
whose
experience
had
been
acquired
in
a
different
climate
and
under
different
social
conditions
from
our
own
and
even
if
these
difficulties
could
be
overcome
another
objection
appeared
to
me
absolutely
insuperable
the
act
of
distinctly
declares
that
only
british
licenses
diplomas
and
degrees
can
now
claim
registration
and
that
without
registration
no
practitioner
can
be
considered
as
legally
qualified
it
is
well
known
with
what
distinguished
honour
miss
garrett
lately
passed
her
examinations
in
paris
and
with
what
brilliant
success
she
gained
one
of
the
most
valuable
medical
degrees
in
europe
and
yet
in
the
official
british
register
her
name
appears
only
and
solely
as
that
of
a
licentiate
of
hall
as
no
such
license
was
now
open
to
me
and
to
other
women
it
was
clear
that
those
of
us
who
went
abroad
for
education
might
expect
after
years
of
severe
labour
to
return
to
england
to
be
refused
official
recognition
on
the
register
and
in
fact
in
the
eye
of
the
law
to
hold
a
position
exactly
analogous
to
that
of
the
most
ignorant
quack
or
herbalist
who
might
open
a
penny
stall
for
the
sale
of
worthless
nostrums
as
such
a
position
was
hardly
to
my
taste
it
became
necessary
to
try
other
means
it
seemed
to
me
highly
desirable
that
if
women
studied
medicine
at
all
they
should
at
once
aim
at
what
is
supposed
to
be
a
high
standard
of
education
and
that
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
cavil
at
their
attainments
they
should
forthwith
aspire
to
the
medical
degree
of
a
british
university
i
first
applied
to
the
university
of
london
of
whose
liberality
one
hears
so
much
and
was
told
by
the
registrar
that
the
present
charter
had
been
purposely
so
worded
as
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
examining
women
for
medical
degrees
and
that
under
that
charter
nothing
whatever
could
be
done
in
their
favour
knowing
that
at
oxford
and
cambridge
the
whole
question
was
complicated
with
regulations
respecting
residence
while
indeed
neither
of
these
universities
furnished
a
complete
medical
education
my
thoughts
naturally
turned
to
scotland
to
which
so
much
credit
is
always
given
for
its
enlightened
views
respecting
education
and
where
the
universities
boast
of
their
freedom
from
ecclesiastical
and
other
trammels
in
march
therefore
i
made
my
first
application
to
the
university
of
edinburgh
and
i
hope
in
the
following
pages
to
give
a
rapid
sketch
of
the
chief
events
of
the
subsequent
three
years
in
connexion
with
that
university
though
time
and
space
oblige
me
to
make
the
sketch
so
brief
that
i
must
ask
the
indulgence
if
in
some
points
it
is
less
plain
and
distinct
than
it
might
be
if
i
could
enter
more
fully
into
details
for
the
sake
of
clearness
let
me
first
explain
in
few
words
who
constitute
the
different
bodies
that
take
a
share
in
the
government
of
edinburgh
university
taken
in
the
order
in
which
my
application
was
considered
by
them
the
medical
faculty
of
course
consists
of
medical
professors
only
the
senatus
comprises
all
the
professors
of
every
faculty
and
also
the
principal
the
university
court
is
composed
of
eight
members
only
and
lastly
the
general
council
of
the
university
consists
of
all
those
graduates
of
edinburgh
who
have
registered
their
names
as
members
each
of
these
bodies
had
to
be
consulted
as
also
the
chancellor
before
any
important
change
could
be
made
when
i
first
went
to
edinburgh
i
found
many
most
kind
and
liberal
friends
among
the
professors
in
the
medical
faculty
itself
sir
james
simpson
professor
hughes
bennett
and
professor
balfour
dean
of
the
medical
faculty
at
once
espoused
my
cause
and
i
need
not
say
that
professor
masson
and
other
members
of
the
faculties
were
not
a
whit
behind
in
kindness
and
help
i
found
on
the
other
hand
a
few
determined
enemies
who
would
listen
to
nothing
i
could
urge
on
the
ground
of
either
justice
or
mercy
and
one
or
two
who
seemed
to
think
that
the
fact
of
a
wishing
to
study
medicine
at
all
quite
exempted
them
from
the
necessity
of
treating
her
even
with
ordinary
courtesy
the
majority
however
occupied
a
somewhat
neutral
position
they
did
not
wish
arbitrarily
to
stretch
their
power
to
exclude
women
from
education
and
yet
they
were
alarmed
at
what
seemed
to
them
the
magnitude
and
novelty
of
the
change
proposed
several
professors
were
especially
timid
about
the
question
of
matriculation
and
argued
that
till
they
had
some
evidence
of
probable
success
it
would
be
premature
to
let
women
matriculate
since
by
so
doing
they
would
acquire
rights
and
privileges
of
the
most
extensive
kind
to
meet
this
difficulty
i
gladly
accepted
a
suggestion
made
to
me
privately
by
the
dean
of
the
medical
faculty
that
i
should
for
the
present
waive
the
question
of
matriculation
and
should
during
the
summer
months
attend
his
class
in
botany
and
that
of
professor
allman
in
natural
history
to
see
whether
as
the
expressed
it
and
english
students
were
really
so
much
more
brutal
than
frenchmen
and
germans
or
whether
a
lady
could
without
discomfort
attend
the
ordinary
classes
this
plan
met
with
much
approval
and
some
of
the
wives
most
kindly
offered
to
accompany
me
to
the
classes
when
the
time
should
come
the
medical
faculty
and
senatus
successively
sanctioned
this
tentative
plan
and
after
a
short
stay
in
edinburgh
i
left
for
england
to
make
preparations
for
returning
to
spend
the
summer
session
as
arranged
but
two
or
three
hostile
professors
appealed
to
the
university
court
some
of
the
students
also
sent
up
a
memorial
against
the
arrangement
proposed
and
the
question
was
reconsidered
i
am
anxious
as
far
as
possible
to
avoid
personalities
in
this
matter
and
yet
i
think
i
can
not
properly
tell
my
story
without
explaining
at
the
outset
that
in
my
opinion
at
least
the
whole
opposition
to
the
medical
education
of
women
has
in
edinburgh
been
dictated
by
one
man
and
his
immediate
followers
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
that
man
is
sir
robert
christison
whose
great
age
and
long
tenure
of
office
naturally
give
him
unusual
weight
both
in
the
university
and
among
the
medical
men
of
edinburgh
having
said
this
i
need
only
remark
further
that
professor
christison
has
ever
since
i
came
to
edinburgh
been
the
only
professor
and
the
only
medical
man
who
has
had
a
seat
in
the
university
court
and
also
the
only
person
who
has
all
along
been
a
member
of
every
body
without
exception
by
whom
our
interests
have
had
to
be
decided
of
the
medical
faculty
the
senatus
the
university
court
the
university
council
and
the
infirmary
board
the
question
then
was
brought
before
the
university
court
in
april
the
meetings
of
the
court
are
held
in
strict
privacy
against
which
the
public
and
the
members
of
the
university
council
have
often
protested
and
i
can
only
state
the
result
of
their
deliberation
on
april
the
following
resolution
was
passed
court
considering
the
difficulties
at
present
standing
in
the
way
of
carrying
out
the
resolution
of
the
senatus
as
a
temporary
arrangement
in
the
interest
of
one
lady
and
not
being
prepared
to
adjudicate
finally
on
the
question
whether
women
should
be
educated
in
the
medical
classes
of
the
university
sustain
the
appeals
and
recall
the
resolution
of
the
the
very
palpable
invitation
to
other
ladies
to
come
forward
which
appeared
on
the
face
of
this
resolution
bore
fruit
for
in
the
course
of
the
next
month
or
two
four
more
ladies
expressed
their
wish
to
be
admitted
as
students
and
certain
of
the
university
authorities
held
out
hopes
that
an
application
for
classes
would
be
successful
accordingly
in
june
i
addressed
a
letter
to
the
rector
of
the
university
who
is
also
president
of
the
university
court
enquiring
whether
the
court
would
their
present
veto
in
case
arrangements
can
be
made
for
the
instruction
of
women
in
separate
classes
and
whether
in
that
case
women
will
be
allowed
to
matriculate
in
the
usual
way
and
to
undergo
the
ordinary
examination
with
a
view
to
obtain
medical
degrees
in
due
course
i
also
wrote
to
the
senatus
asking
them
to
recommend
the
matriculation
of
women
as
medical
students
on
the
understanding
that
separate
classes
should
be
formed
and
moreover
addressed
a
letter
to
the
dean
of
the
medical
faculty
offering
on
behalf
of
my
and
myself
to
guarantee
whatever
minimum
fee
the
faculty
might
fix
as
remuneration
for
these
separate
classes
on
july
at
a
meeting
of
the
medical
faculty
of
the
university
it
was
resolved
to
recommend
to
the
senatus
that
ladies
be
allowed
to
matriculate
as
medical
students
and
to
pass
the
usual
preliminary
examination
for
registration
that
ladies
be
allowed
to
attend
medical
classes
and
to
receive
certificates
of
attendance
qualifying
for
examination
provided
the
classes
are
confined
entirely
to
ladies
that
the
medical
professors
be
allowed
to
have
classes
for
ladies
but
no
professor
shall
be
compelled
to
give
such
course
of
lectures
that
in
conformity
with
the
request
of
miss
letter
to
the
dean
ladies
be
permitted
to
arrange
with
the
medical
faculty
or
with
the
individual
professors
as
to
minimum
fee
for
the
classes
at
a
meeting
of
the
senatus
academicus
july
the
report
of
the
medical
faculty
was
read
agreed
to
and
ordered
to
be
transmitted

or
to
such
part
of
the

of
instruction
given
in
such
classes
as
the
university
court
may
from
time
to
time
think
fit
and
approve
the
fee
for
the
full
course
of
instruction
in
such
classes
shall
be
four
guineas
but
in
the
event
of
the
number
of

any
such

being
too
small
to
provide
a
reasonable
remuneration
at
that
rate
it
shall
be
in
the
power
of
the

make
arrangements
for
a
higher
fee
subject
to
the

sanction
of
the
university
court
all
women
attending
such
classes
shall
be
subject
to
all
the
regulations
now
or
at
any
future
time
in
force
in
the
university
as
to
the
matriculation
of
students
their
attendance
on
classes
examination
or
otherwise
the
above
regulations
shall
take
effect
as
from
the
commencement
of
session
in
accordance
with
the
above
resolutions
four
other
ladies
and
myself
were
in
october
admitted
provisionally
to
the
usual
preliminary
examination
in
arts
prescribed
for
medical
students
entering
the
university
having
duly
passed
and
received
certificates
to
that
effect
from
the
dean
of
the
medical
faculty
we
after
the
issue
of
the
regulations
above
cited
all
matriculated
in
the
ordinary
manner
at
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
the
university
we
paid
the
usual
fee
inscribed
our
names
in
the
university
album
with
the
usual
particulars
including
the
faculty
in
which
we
proposed
to
study
and
received
the
ordinary
matriculation
tickets
which
bore
our
names
and
declared
us
to
be
academiæ
we
were
at
the
same
time
registered
in
due
course
as
students
of
medicine
by
the
registrar
of
the
branch
council
for
scotland
in
the
government
register
kept
by
order
of
the
general
council
of
medical
education
and
registration
of
the
united
kingdom
such
registration
being
obligatory
on
all
medical
students
and
affording
the
sole
legal
record
of
the
date
at
which
they
have
commenced
their
studies
it
seemed
now
as
if
smooth
water
had
at
length
been
reached
after
seven
months
of
almost
incessant
struggle
the
temporary
scheme
first
suggested
had
been
set
aside
but
its
place
had
been
taken
by
one
much
more
comprehensive
which
had
resulted
from
five
months
of
consideration
and
consultation
and
which
had
ultimately
received
the
sanction
of
every
one
of
the
university
authorities
in
succession
not
only
were
women
allowed
the
privilege
of
matriculation
which
we
had
been
told
involved
so
much
but
formal
regulations
entitled
the
education
of
women
in
medicine
in
the
university
had
been
framed
and
have
now
for
three
years
formed
an
integral
part
of
the
university
calendar
for
six
months
our
hopes
seemed
realised
we
pursued
most
interesting
courses
of
study
in
the
university
and
found
nothing
but
kindness
at
the
hands
of
our
teachers
and
courtesy
from
the
male
students
whenever
we
happened
to
meet
them
in
the
quadrangle
or
on
the
staircases
even
dr
christison
was
reported
to
have
said
in
senatus
that
as
the
experiment
was
to
be
tried
he
for
one
would
to
give
it
a
fair
trial
though
the
lectures
were
delivered
at
different
hours
the
instruction
given
to
us
and
to
the
male
students
was
identical
and
when
the
class
examinations
took
place
we
received
and
answered
the
same
papers
at
the
same
hour
and
on
identical
conditions
having
been
told
that
marks
would
be
awarded
indifferently
to
sections
of
the
class
this
latter
expression
being
by
the
bye
repeatedly
used
during
the
course
of
the
term
by
both
the
professors
who
instructed
us
i
am
obliged
now
to
mention
the
results
which
appeared
in
the
not
with
a
view
to
claim
any
special
credit
for
the
ladies
whose
efforts
to
obtain
education
might
well
make
them
more
zealous
than
most
of
the
ordinary
students
but
because
i
believe
that
the
facts
i
am
about
to
mention
had
a
real
and
immediate
connexion
with
subsequent
events
in
the
class
of
physiology
there
had
been
male
students
of
whom
appeared
in
the
honours
list
in
the
chemistry
class
there
were
male
students
of
whom
obtained
honours
of
the
women
were
in
honours
in
both
classes
one
of
the
ladies
obtained
the
third
place
in
the
chemistry
and
as
the
two
gentlemen
above
her
had
already
gone
through
a
course
of
lectures
on
the
same
subject
miss
pechey
was
actually
first
of
her
year
in
the
college
calendar
it
was
stated
that
four
students
who
have
received
the
highest
marks
to
have
the
hope
scholarships
such
scholarships
giving
free
admission
to
the
college
laboratory
and
having
been
founded
by
the
late
professor
hope
from
the
proceeds
of
lectures
given
to
ladies
some
fifty
years
previously
it
had
occurred
to
us
that
if
any
lady
won
this
scholarship
she
might
be
debarred
from
making
full
use
of
it
as
regards
the
laboratory
in
consequence
of
the
prohibition
against
mixed
classes
but
as
it
had
been
distinctly
ordained
that
we
were
to
be
subject
to
the
regulations
in
force
in
the
university
as
to
examinations
it
had
occurred
to
us
as
possible
that
the
very
name
of
hope
scholar
could
be
wrested
from
the
successful
candidate
and
given
over
her
head
to
the
fifth
student
on
the
list
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
a
man
but
this
was
actually
done
at
the
same
time
that
the
professor
announced
to
us
his
intention
of
withholding
the
hope
scholarship
from
the
student
who
had
won
it
on
the
ground
that
having
studied
at
a
different
hour
she
was
not
a
member
of
chemistry
though
he
at
the
same
time
gave
her
a
bronze
medal
of
the
university
to
which
i
should
think
her
claim
must
have
been
neither
greater
nor
less
since
these
medals
were
given
to
the
five
students
highest
on
the
list
he
offered
us
written
certificates
of
having
attended
a
class
in
the
university
as
of
course
he
saw
that
to
give
the
ordinary
certificates
of
attendance
on
chemistry
class
of
the
would
be
to
destroy
his
own
argument
with
reference
to
the
scholarship
as
however
such
certificates
were
absolutely
worthless
to
us
as
students
of
medicine
we
declined
them
and
appealed
to
the
senatus
to
ordain
that
the
ordinary
certificates
should
be
granted
to
us
as
they
alone
would
qualify
for
professional
examination
at
the
same
time
miss
pechey
made
an
appeal
to
have
the
hope
scholarship
awarded
to
her
in
due
course
it
is
hardly
credible
that
by
very
narrow
majorities
in
each
case
the
senatus
decided
that
we
were
to
have
exactly
the
ordinary
certificates
which
declared
us
to
have
attended
chemistry
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
and
yet
acquiesced
in
miss
being
deprived
of
her
scholarship
on
the
ground
that
she
was
not
a
member
of
that
class
i
do
not
wish
to
dwell
longer
on
these
incidents
but
i
have
narrated
them
here
because
i
believe
that
the
above
mentioned
results
of
the
class
examinations
aroused
in
our
opponents
a
conviction
that
the
experiment
was
not
going
to
fail
of
itself
as
they
had
confidently
hoped
but
that
if
it
was
to
be
suppressed
at
all
vigorous
measures
must
be
taken
for
that
purpose
at
the
previous
meeting
of
the
university
council
no
professor
had
stood
up
to
oppose
the
admission
of
women
though
dr
andrew
wood
had
covered
himself
with
glory
by
protesting
that
he
had
too
many
sons
to
provide
for
to
acquiesce
in
the
education
of
women
for
the
medical
profession
at
the
next
meeting
however
of
the
council
in
april
professor
masson
moved
that
in
view
of
the
success
that
had
hitherto
attended
the
studies
the
existing
regulations
should
be
so
far
relaxed
as
to
allow
of
the
attendance
of
women
in
the
ordinary
classes
where
no
special
reasons
existed
to
the
contrary
that
they
might
be
spared
the
additional
expense
inconvenience
and
difficulty
attendant
on
the
formation
of
separate
classes
in
every
subject
professor
balfour
dean
of
the
medical
faculty
seconded
this
motion
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
arrangements
might
easily
be
made
to
carry
it
out
professors
laycock
and
christison
however
opposed
it
vigorously
and
that
in
speeches
of
such
a
character
that
the
remarked
in
a
leading
article
can
not
sufficiently
express
the
indignation
with
which
we
read
such
language
and
we
must
say
that
it
is
the
strongest
argument
against
the
admission
of
young
ladies
to
the
edinburgh
medical
classes
that
they
would
attend
the
lectures
of
professors
capable
of
talking
in
this
when
the
vote
was
taken
the
motion
in
our
favour
was
lost
by
votes
to
and
no
change
was
therefore
made
in
the
university
regulations
the
professor
of
botany
kindly
made
arrangements
for
giving
to
us
and
other
ladies
a
separate
course
of
lectures
though
he
much
regretted
to
be
forced
to
this
double
and
needless
expenditure
of
time
and
trouble
dr
allman
the
professor
of
natural
history
who
had
in
the
previous
summer
consented
to
my
entering
his
ordinary
class
stated
that
his
health
would
not
allow
him
to
undertake
the
labour
of
two
classes
and
therefore
he
could
not
teach
us
we
then
made
application
for
instruction
to
dr
alleyne
nicholson
the
teacher
of
the
same
subject
and
he
at
once
agreed
to
our
request
before
making
any
arrangements
he
spoke
to
the
members
of
his
class
at
their
first
meeting
and
mentioning
our
application
he
enquired
whether
they
would
unite
with
him
in
inviting
us
to
join
their
class
this
they
unanimously
did
and
as
we
had
no
objection
to
offer
the
first
was
inaugurated
and
continued
throughout
the
summer
without
the
slightest
inconvenience
in
the
meantime
we
were
anxious
to
make
arrangements
for
the
next
winter
session
and
it
was
especially
necessary
that
a
course
of
instruction
in
anatomy
should
be
provided
as
the
subject
was
one
of
the
greatest
importance
and
the
university
professor
flatly
refused
either
to
instruct
us
himself
or
allow
his
assistant
to
do
so
in
any
way
whatever
under
these
circumstances
we
endeavoured
to
obtain
a
competent
teacher
who
should
form
a
special
class
for
our
instruction
but
i
was
repeatedly
warned
that
by
this
time
the
medical
prejudice
had
been
so
strongly
aroused
against
us
and
the
medical
influence
was
so
strongly
at
work
that
we
should
fail
in
our
endeavours
as
no
young
medical
man
dare
run
the
risk
of
being
ostracised
for
giving
us
help
the
only
teacher
of
anatomy
who
was
already
recognised
by
the
university
was
dr
handyside
who
was
one
of
a
band
of
nine
associated
lecturers
who
conjointly
rented
a
building
called
hall
for
their
lectures
some
of
these
lecturers
were
indignant
at
the
way
in
which
we
were
treated
in
the
university
and
in
july
they
by
a
majority
passed
the
following
resolutions
that
it
is
expedient
that
lecturers
in
this
medical
school
should
be
free
to
lecture
to
female
as
well
as
to
male
students
that
no
restrictions
be
imposed
on
the
lecturers
as
to
the
manner
in
which
instruction
is
to
be
imparted
to
women
after
the
passing
of
this
regulation
we
applied
to
dr
handyside
to
know
if
he
could
make
arrangements
for
giving
us
a
separate
class
he
replied
that
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
him
to
do
so
consistently
with
his
duty
to
his
other
students
but
that
if
we
liked
to
attend
his
course
of
anatomy
in
the
ordinary
way
he
should
be
happy
to
receive
us
dr
heron
watson
similarly
consented
to
admit
us
to
his
ordinary
course
of
lectures
on
surgery
and
so
our
arrangements
for
winter
lectures
were
complete
the
class
of
practical
anatomy
always
meets
at
the
beginning
of
october
although
the
lectures
do
not
commence
till
the
following
month
the
more
studious
and
industrious
students
usually
come
up
at
the
earlier
date
but
those
who
care
less
about
their
work
seldom
appear
till
november
as
that
is
the
beginning
of
the
compulsory
session
all
through
october
we
studied
under
dr
handyside
with
great
comfort
the
students
who
worked
with
us
though
in
another
part
of
the
room
were
never
uncivil
and
in
fact
we
hardly
exchanged
a
dozen
sentences
with
any
of
them
during
the
month
dr
handyside
and
his
demonstrator
both
told
us
that
they
had
never
seen
so
much
steady
earnest
work
as
since
we
joined
the
class
and
expressed
their
opinion
that
the
results
were
quite
as
valuable
for
the
male
students
as
for
our
ourselves
with
november
the
lectures
began
and
everything
went
on
satisfactorily
for
another
ten
days
about
this
time
acting
on
the
advice
of
a
medical
friend
we
made
an
application
for
permission
to
study
in
the
wards
of
the
royal
infirmary
and
somewhat
to
our
surprise
were
met
by
a
curt
refusal
as
we
knew
that
several
of
the
managers
were
and
just
men
we
felt
sure
that
they
could
not
have
fully
understood
the
importance
to
us
of
the
concession
we
desired
and
on
enquiry
i
found
this
was
the
case
one
of
those
who
had
voted
against
our
admission
confessed
to
me
that
he
had
in
so
doing
been
guided
simply
by
the
medical
members
of
the
board
and
that
he
was
not
even
aware
that
we
were
matriculated
students
of
the
university
and
that
we
could
not
complete
our
education
without
attending
the
infirmary
as
there
was
no
other
hospital
in
edinburgh
of
the
size
prescribed
for
we
therefore
drew
up
a
memorial
stating
our
grounds
of
application
and
another
was
also
sent
in
by
our
two
teachers
dr
watson
and
dr
handyside
urging
on
the
board
the
great
injustice
that
would
be
done
by
our
exclusion
we
also
obtained
and
sent
in
a
written
paper
from
three
of
the
medical
officers
of
the
infirmary
promising
to
give
us
all
needful
instruction
if
we
were
admitted
when
these
documents
were
presented
to
the
managers
a
majority
of
those
present
were
in
favour
of
our
immediate
admission
but
on
the
ground
of
want
of
notice
our
opponents
got
the
matter
deferred
for
a
week
from
that
time
the
behaviour
of
the
students
changed
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
what
means
were
used
or
what
strings
were
pulled
but
i
know
that
the
result
was
that
instead
of
being
as
heretofore
silent
and
inoffensive
a
certain
proportion
of
the
students
with
whom
we
worked
became
markedly
offensive
and
insolent
and
took
every
opportunity
of
practising
the
petty
annoyances
that
occur
to
thoroughly
lads
such
as
shutting
doors
in
our
faces
ostentatiously
crowding
into
the
seats
we
usually
occupied
bursting
into
and
howls
when
we
approached
as
if
a
coalition
had
been
formed
to
make
our
position
as
uncomfortable
as
might
be
at
the
same
time
a
petition
against
our
admission
to
the
infirmary
was
handed
about
and
signatures
were
obtained
though
if
some
of
the
reports
i
heard
were
true
but
a
very
small
number
out
of
the
had
even
read
the
petition
before
signing
it
be
this
as
it
may
the
petition
was
got
ready
for
the
adjourned
meeting
and
when
that
came
every
opponent
we
had
among
the
managers
was
at
his
place
while
some
of
our
friends
were
unavoidably
absent
and
the
lord
provost
being
in
the
chair
was
precluded
from
voting
so
that
the
medical
party
gained
an
easy
victory
but
when
i
say
the
medical
party
i
ought
to
explain
that
three
medical
men
voted
on
our
side
a
point
on
which
i
shall
have
to
say
something
subsequently
the
students
were
naturally
elated
at
finding
so
much
attention
paid
to
their
petition
especially
as
i
was
told
that
some
of
the
medical
professors
had
warmly
applauded
them
for
their
exertions
and
i
suppose
the
lowest
section
among
them
began
to
wonder
whether
if
they
had
succeeded
in
keeping
us
out
of
the
infirmary
they
might
not
by
a
little
extra
brutality
drive
us
away
from
the
two
days
later
came
the
second
competitive
examination
of
the
term
and
on
this
day
occurred
the
riot
when
the
gates
were
shut
in
our
faces
by
a
mob
who
stood
within
smoking
and
passing
about
bottles
of
whiskey
while
they
abused
us
in
the
foulest
possible
language
it
would
be
difficult
to
speak
in
too
strong
terms
of
the
conduct
of
those
engaged
in
this
outrage
or
of
those
who
were
morally
responsible
for
it
but
i
am
glad
to
say
a
word
about
a
part
of
the
story
which
has
not
been
made
sufficiently
public
the
conduct
of
those
of
the
students
whose
indignation
against
the
rioters
was
even
deeper
than
our
own
one
gentleman
rushed
down
from
hall
and
at
great
risk
to
himself
forced
open
the
gates
for
our
admission
and
a
number
of
others
made
their
way
in
after
us
to
see
that
we
came
to
no
harm
when
the
class
which
was
interrupted
throughout
by
the
clamour
outside
was
over
dr
handyside
asked
me
if
we
would
withdraw
through
a
back
door
but
i
said
that
i
thought
there
were
quite
enough
gentlemen
in
the
class
to
protect
us
and
so
it
proved
as
i
spoke
a
number
came
around
us
and
formed
a
regular
in
front
behind
and
on
each
side
and
encompassed
by
them
we
passed
through
the
still
howling
crowd
at
the
gate
and
reached
home
with
no
other
injuries
than
those
inflicted
on
our
dresses
by
the
mud
hurled
at
us
by
our
chivalrous
foes
nor
was
this
all
when
we
arrived
at
the
college
next
day
at
the
same
hour
we
found
quite
a
formidable
array
of
gentlemen
with
big
sticks
in
their
hands
who
were
keeping
back
a
rabble
that
looked
greatly
disgusted
but
merely
vented
their
spite
in
remarkably
bad
language
as
the
gentlemen
referred
to
raised
their
hats
as
we
approached
and
instantly
followed
us
in
and
took
their
seats
on
the
back
rows
after
the
lecture
was
over
they
formed
round
us
as
on
the
evening
before
escorted
us
home
gave
us
three
deafening
cheers
and
dispersed
the
explanation
of
all
which
was
that
hearing
rumours
of
renewed
rioting
a
certain
number
of
manly
men
among
the
students
had
resolved
that
the
thing
should
not
be
and
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
this
same
stalwart
awaited
and
attended
us
daily
till
the
rowdies
tacitly
agreed
to
lay
aside
hostilities
then
i
myself
asked
our
volunteer
guard
to
discontinue
their
most
chivalrous
escort
and
quiet
was
restored
no
further
event
of
importance
occurred
during
the
winter
except
the
meetings
of
infirmary
contributors
at
the
first
of
which
a
close
contest
took
place
between
managers
known
to
be
favourable
to
us
and
those
known
to
be
unfriendly
a
new
act
came
into
operation
at
this
date
and
all
the
managers
had
to
vacate
their
seats
unless
i
can
give
no
more
significant
proof
of
the
immense
amount
of
pressure
brought
to
bear
by
the
medical
clique
than
by
stating
that
of
the
three
medical
men
who
had
voted
for
us
six
weeks
before
it
was
found
when
the
day
of
election
came
that
two
had
turned
their
coats
while
the
one
who
refused
to
do
so
was
unseated
by
the
medical
body
that
he
had
represented
at
the
meeting
on
at
which
six
managers
were
to
be
elected
the
lord
provost
himself
proposed
the
election
of
six
gentlemen
known
to
be
friendly
to
the
admission
of
ladies
to
the
infirmary
but
by
the
very
narrow
majority
of
votes
to
the
managers
previously
on
the
board
were
returned
no
other
question
was
raised
and
those
who
voted
with
the
lord
provost
did
so
simply
in
consequence
of
the
importance
they
attached
to
the
exclusion
of
the
ladies
by
those
managers
who
now
desired
at
a
subsequent
meeting
the
rev
professor
charteris
brought
forward
a
motion
expressive
of
the
desire
of
the
contributors
that
immediate
arrangements
should
be
made
for
the
admission
of
the
ladies
and
this
motion
was
seconded
by
sir
james
coxe
but
was
lost
by
a
similarly
small
majority
on
this
latter
occasion
two
incidents
occurred
that
deserve
notice
firstly
a
petition
in
favour
of
the
admission
was
presented
signed
by
women
of
edinburgh
secondly
mrs
nichol
an
elderly
lady
whose
name
is
venerated
throughout
edinburgh
made
in
spite
of
ill
health
the
great
exertion
of
coming
forward
at
that
public
meeting
to
ask
one
question
as
she
distinctly
said
the
interests
of
the
lady
students
but
on
behalf
of
those
women
who
looked
forward
to
see
what
kind
of
men
were
they
who
were
to
be
the
sole
medical
attendants
of
the
next
generation
of
women
if
women
doctors
are
not
the
question
which
she
said
she
had
been
commissioned
to
ask
by
more
than
women
belonging
to
all
classes
and
all
parts
of
the
country
was
as
follows
the
students
studying
at
present
in
the
infirmary
can
not
contemplate
with
equanimity
the
presence
of
ladies
as
how
is
it
possible
that
they
can
possess
either
the
scientific
spirit
or
the
personal
purity
of
mind
which
alone
would
justify
their
presence
in
the
female
wards
during
the
most
delicate
operations
on
and
examinations
of
female
patients
this
question
was
received
according
to
the
newspaper
report
with
hisses
and
but
no
one
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
perhaps
in
truth
no
reply
could
have
been
more
significant
than
the
burst
of
yells
and
howls
which
greeted
the
question
from
a
gallery
filled
by
students
who
indeed
so
conducted
themselves
generally
as
to
elicit
a
remark
to
me
from
a
learned
professor
famous
for
his
quaint
sayings
ye
can
say
now
fought
with
beasts
at
ephesus
about
the
same
time
a
petition
signed
by
male
students
was
presented
to
the
infirmary
managers
praying
that
the
lady
students
should
no
longer
be
excluded
but
no
attention
was
paid
to
the
request
and
when
subsequently
a
similar
application
was
made
to
the
managers
by
a
deputation
of
very
influential
citizens
they
again
refused
by
a
majority
to
do
anything
in
our
behalf
professor
balfour
moved
the
appointment
of
a
committee
to
enquire
into
a
scheme
for
the
instruction
of
ladies
proposed
by
certain
of
the
medical
officers
of
the
infirmary
but
professor
christison
carried
an
amendment
negativing
even
this
measure
and
thus
another
year
of
hospital
instruction
was
lost
with
each
succeeding
session
new
students
joined
our
small
class
partly
in
consequence
of
the
very
kind
encouragement
held
out
by
lady
amberley
dr
garrett
anderson
and
other
friends
in
the
way
of
scholarships
for
since
public
indignation
was
excited
by
the
refusal
of
the
hope
scholarship
to
miss
pechey
hardly
a
term
has
passed
without
some
generous
offer
of
valuable
prizes
for
those
ladies
who
needed
such
assistance
to
pursue
their
studies
and
who
by
their
success
in
competitive
examinations
showed
themselves
worthy
of
them
such
kindness
is
the
more
valuable
at
a
time
when
by
incessant
delays
and
difficulties
every
effort
is
evidently
being
made
to
exhaust
alike
the
patience
and
the
purses
of
the
troublesome
women
who
desire
to
complete
the
work
they
have
begun
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
enter
into
details
respecting
the
progress
in
their
studies
further
than
to
state
that
in
every
course
in
which
they
have
competed
for
prizes
more
than
half
of
the
whole
class
have
been
in
the
honours
list
and
in
some
cases
every
lady
student
has
so
appeared
so
that
any
refusal
to
grant
them
further
instruction
can
hardly
be
based
on
the
plea
that
they
have
not
done
their
best
to
avail
themselves
of
what
was
already
afforded
during
the
two
years
and
the
five
original
students
who
entered
in
had
completed
the
first
half
of
their
university
course
partly
by
attendance
on
separate
classes
in
the
university
and
partly
by
means
of
lectures
but
at
the
end
of
these
two
years
a
appeared
imminent
the
rules
of
the
university
forbid
any
student
to
take
more
than
four
classes
outside
the
walls
and
those
four
classes
we
had
already
taken
professor
christison
and
others
whose
classes
came
next
in
term
gave
a
curt
refusal
to
our
request
for
instruction
although
we
again
offered
to
guarantee
any
fee
that
might
be
required
in
this
dilemma
we
applied
for
help
to
the
senatus
and
suggested
that
if
no
other
means
could
be
devised
the
difficulty
might
be
solved
in
either
of
two
ways
by
appointment
of
special
university
lecturers
whose
payment
we
would
guarantee
or
by
the
relaxation
in
our
case
of
the
ordinary
regulations
so
that
we
might
take
an
increased
number
of
classes
when
these
proposals
came
before
the
senatus
it
was
decided
to
take
a
legal
opinion
as
to
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
university
and
an
opinion
adverse
to
our
interests
having
been
given
the
senatus
decided
on
july
by
a
majority
of
one
that
they
would
take
no
action
in
the
matter
in
these
circumstances
a
committee
of
friends
which
had
been
formed
for
our
assistance
caused
a
statement
of
the
facts
to
be
drawn
up
and
submitted
to
other
counsel
and
obtained
from
the
lord
advocate
and
sheriff
fraser
an
opinion
to
the
following
effect
that
it
was
quite
competent
to
the
university
authorities
to
make
any
necessary
provision
for
the
completion
of
the
education
and
that
the
medical
faculty
were
bound
to
admit
the
ladies
to
professional
examination
on
the
subjects
in
which
they
were
already
qualified
to
pass
i
must
explain
that
the
advice
of
counsel
had
been
asked
on
this
last
point
in
consequence
of
a
rumour
that
difficulties
might
be
made
respecting
the
examination
that
was
now
due
at
the
end
of
two
years
of
professional
study
the
first
official
notice
on
this
subject
was
however
received
by
us
on
saturday
october
after
the
fees
for
such
examination
had
been
paid
and
tickets
of
admission
obtained
the
examination
itself
being
due
on
the
of
the
same
month
and
the
ladies
concerned
having
studied
for
two
years
with
the
view
of
passing
this
examination
for
which
they
had
more
especially
been
preparing
assiduously
for
the
last
six
months
on
the
following
monday
october
i
moreover
received
an
official
notice
that
the
dean
of
the
medical
faculty
had
been
interdicted
by
the
faculty
from
giving
to
ladies
any
papers
for
the
preliminary
examination
in
arts
which
was
to
take
place
the
following
october
three
ladies
had
come
up
to
edinburgh
from
different
parts
of
the
country
with
the
express
object
of
passing
these
examinations
and
if
prevented
from
doing
so
they
would
be
retarded
in
their
studies
to
the
extent
of
one
year
the
excessive
shortness
of
the
notice
given
made
it
impossible
even
to
appeal
to
the
senatus
and
the
only
course
open
to
me
was
to
submit
the
facts
for
the
opinion
of
counsel
this
was
done
and
we
were
informed
that
the
course
taken
by
the
medical
faculty
was
quite
illegal
while
an
express
invitation
to
lady
students
formed
part
of
the
official
calendar
of
the
university
this
opinion
was
forwarded
to
the
dean
whose
kindness
to
us
had
been
invariable
and
i
am
sure
that
he
was
glad
by
it
to
be
released
from
the
painful
necessity
of
obeying
the
medical
faculty
in
this
matter
the
ladies
were
accordingly
examined
in
the
ordinary
course
but
the
excitements
of
the
month
were
not
yet
at
an
end
on
applying
for
matriculation
tickets
the
ladies
were
informed
by
the
clerk
that
the
principal
sir
alexander
grant
had
written
him
word
that
in
consequence
of
representations
made
to
him
by
professor
christison
he
desired
that
no
ladies
should
at
present
be
allowed
to
matriculate
on
this
point
and
that
regarding
the
professional
examination
we
of
course
appealed
at
once
to
the
senatus
at
the
meeting
at
which
our
appeal
was
considered
committee
for
securing
complete
medical
education
for
women
in
also
presented
the
opinion
obtained
by
them
from
counsel
together
with
a
letter
urging
that
complete
provision
should
be
made
for
our
instruction
at
their
meeting
on
october
the
senatus
at
once
decided
both
points
of
appeal
in
our
favour
the
prohibition
which
had
never
had
any
legal
weight
was
overruled
and
the
permission
to
women
to
matriculate
and
pass
the
arts
examinations
was
renewed
and
declared
to
be
in
force
so
long
as
the
present
regulations
stood
in
the
calendar
the
medical
faculty
also
were
instructed
at
once
to
admit
the
ladies
who
were
prepared
for
it
to
the
professional
examination
on
the
following
day
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
in
spite
of
the
incessant
worry
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
for
the
past
ten
days
they
all
passed
successfully
i
am
sure
that
all
those
who
have
had
to
prepare
for
severe
university
examinations
will
appreciate
the
difficulties
under
which
they
did
so
a
few
days
later
came
a
meeting
of
the
university
council
when
dr
alexander
wood
made
a
gallant
attempt
to
get
a
vote
passed
to
the
effect
that
university
is
bound
in
honour
and
justice
to
render
it
possible
for
those
women
who
have
already
commenced
their
studies
to
complete
the
remarked
respecting
this
motion
is
precisely
the
ground
we
have
always
taken
up
about
the
matter
and
we
hope
that
the
general
council
of
the
university
will
by
the
adoption
of
dr
alexander
motion
put
an
end
to
the
controversy
which
had
redounded
so
little
to
the
credit
of
that
a
memorial
in
favour
of
the
resolution
was
also
presented
signed
by
more
than
nine
thousand
women
residing
in
all
parts
of
the
country
and
representing
almost
every
rank
in
society
very
vigorous
opposition
to
it
was
however
made
by
professors
turner
thomson
and
christison
all
of
whom
were
members
of
the
medical
faculty
and
ultimately
an
amendment
which
proposed
to
leave
the
question
to
be
settled
by
the
senatus
and
university
court
was
carried
by
votes
to
at
a
meeting
of
the
senatus
held
on
the
question
of
making
further
provision
for
the
instruction
of
women
was
brought
forward
and
a
letter
was
received
from
the
committee
of
our
friends
stating
that
the
event
of
special
lecturers
being
appointed
by
the
university
to
give
qualifying
instruction
to
women
the
committee
are
willing
to
guarantee
the
payment
to
them
of
any
sum
that
may
be
fixed
by
the
senatus
for
their
remuneration
in
case
the
fees
of
the
ladies
are
insufficient
for
that
purpose
and
that
if
necessary
they
are
willing
further
to
undertake
to
provide
such
rooms
and
accommodation
as
may
be
required
for
the
delivery
of
the
said
lectures
if
it
should
be
found
absolutely
impossible
for
the
university
to
provide
space
for
that
after
a
long
debate
the
senatus
decided
by
a
majority
that
they
would
not
take
any
steps
to
enable
us
to
complete
our
education
at
a
meeting
a
few
days
later
the
senatus
further
decided
by
fourteen
votes
to
thirteen
to
recommend
to
the
university
court
that
the
existing
regulations
in
favour
of
female
students
be
rescinded
without
prejudice
however
to
the
rights
of
those
already
studying
this
resolution
was
as
i
said
passed
by
fourteen
votes
to
thirteen
and
it
may
be
worth
while
to
mention
that
two
of
the
fourteen
votes
were
those
of
dr
christison
and
sir
alexander
grant
who
were
themselves
members
of
the
university
court
to
which
the
recommendation
was
to
be
made
that
the
proposed
measure
was
not
the
wish
of
a
real
majority
of
the
professors
was
soon
made
abundantly
clear
for
a
protest
against
it
was
sent
up
to
the
court
signed
by
eighteen
out
of
the
professors
of
the
university
while
two
out
of
the
remaining
seventeen
were
persistently
neutral
never
indeed
having
voted
on
the
question
from
first
to
last
in
the
teeth
of
this
protest
it
was
of
course
almost
impossible
that
the
regulations
could
be
rescinded
and
so
they
were
once
more
confirmed
by
the
university
court
on
january
the
next
event
of
importance
was
the
annual
of
infirmary
managers
six
of
whom
were
to
be
chosen
at
the
meeting
at
the
beginning
of
january
as
on
a
former
occasion
the
election
evidently
turned
wholly
on
our
admission
to
or
exclusion
from
the
infirmary
wards
the
medical
party
moved
the
of
the
former
managers
and
they
were
sure
of
the
support
of
everybody
who
did
not
consider
our
admission
a
vital
question
our
friends
on
the
contrary
brought
forward
a
list
of
gentlemen
all
of
whom
were
known
to
be
friendly
to
our
cause
after
a
very
warm
debate
the
list
of
our
friends
proved
to
be
successful
being
supported
by
votes
while
were
recorded
on
the
other
side
professor
masson
then
moved
that
a
statute
be
enacted
by
the
court
of
contributors
giving
the
same
educational
advantages
in
the
infirmary
to
female
as
well
as
to
male
students
the
hostile
party
finding
themselves
in
a
minority
endeavoured
to
prevent
this
being
put
to
the
vote
on
technical
grounds
which
were
subsequently
found
to
be
of
no
legal
importance
failing
in
this
they
then
adopted
the
remarkably
dignified
course
of
decamping
in
a
body
accompanied
i
must
confess
by
some
ironical
cheers
from
those
left
behind
in
the
lull
that
succeeded
professor
masson
brought
forward
his
motion
which
was
seconded
by
the
rev
dr
guthrie
and
passed
without
a
dissentient
voice
this
statute
is
therefore
now
actually
law
in
the
infirmary
and
considering
that
managers
friendly
to
us
had
also
been
elected
it
might
have
been
thought
that
our
difficulties
there
were
at
end
but
now
comes
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
the
whole
story
on
a
scrutiny
of
the
votes
it
was
found
that
with
the
majority
had
voted
firms
ladies
and
seven
doctors
on
the
other
side
were
fourteen
firms
two
ladies
doctors
and
three
druggists
these
figures
may
seem
indeed
to
have
a
tolerable
moral
significance
but
it
is
not
with
that
that
i
am
at
this
moment
concerned
it
occurred
to
the
defeated
party
that
here
might
be
found
a
straw
for
them
drowning
to
catch
at
that
possibly
a
legal
objection
might
be
sustained
against
the
votes
of
firms
which
were
so
largely
in
our
favour
and
that
if
so
the
victory
might
yet
be
secured
the
result
was
that
when
the
contributors
assembled
at
the
adjourned
meeting
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
the
result
of
the
scrutiny
and
the
final
declaration
of
the
election
the
lord
provost
found
himself
served
with
an
interdict
forbidding
him
to
declare
the
new
managers
duly
elected
on
the
ground
that
the
votes
of
firms
were
incompetent
and
that
by
means
of
these
the
majority
had
been
obtained
instances
have
occurred
before
now
where
personal
feelings
have
triumphed
over
public
interests
but
i
do
not
think
that
i
ever
heard
of
quite
so
reckless
a
course
as
this
by
which
the
medical
clique
has
plunged
the
great
edinburgh
hospital
into
litigation
and
that
with
some
of
its
own
most
generous
supporters
rather
than
allow
a
dozen
women
to
obtain
in
its
wards
the
instruction
that
the
contributors
had
decreed
they
should
receive
the
litigation
thus
begun
is
still
pending
and
the
incomplete
board
of
managers
have
for
all
these
months
carried
on
the
business
of
the
infirmary
without
any
representatives
at
all
from
the
court
of
contributors
and
it
is
probable
that
they
make
the
very
fact
of
their
deficient
numbers
the
excuse
for
having
up
to
this
moment
given
no
effect
whatever
to
the
statute
unanimously
passed
in
our
favour
last
january
by
the
court
of
contributors
we
applied
immediately
after
the
meeting
for
tickets
of
admission
but
were
told
that
the
managers
must
first
be
consulted
and
from
that
day
to
this
no
tickets
have
been
issued
to
us
though
the
statute
referred
to
legally
secured
that
all
registered
students
of
medicine
shall
be
admitted
to
the
educational
advantages
of
the
infirmary
without
distinction
of
the
matter
however
can
now
be
only
one
of
time
and
since
the
law
of
the
infirmary
is
at
length
on
our
side
our
opponents
may
i
think
rest
assured
that
our
patience
in
awaiting
the
end
will
be
at
least
equal
to
theirs
in
all
such
struggles
a
present
triumph
may
be
snatched
by
those
in
brief
authority
but
the
future
belongs
inalienably
to
the
cause
of
justice
and
liberality
in
the
meantime
i
had
on
behalf
of
my
and
myself
appealed
to
the
university
court
to
provide
us
with
the
means
of
completing
our
education
and
our
friends
of
the
committee
also
forwarded
to
the
court
a
further
legal
opinion
from
the
lord
advocate
and
sheriff
fraser
to
the
effect
that
the
university
authorities
had
full
powers
to
permit
the
matriculation
of
women
in
that
the
resolutions
then
passed
amounted
to
a
permission
to
women
to
in
the
university
and
that
therefore
the
women
concerned
were
entitled
to
demand
the
means
of
doing
so
and
finally
that
if
such
means
were
persistently
refused
the
legal
mode
of
redress
lay
in
an
action
of
declarator
on
january
the
university
court
declared
that
they
could
not
make
any
arrangements
to
enable
us
to
pursue
our
studies
with
a
view
to
a
degree
but
that
we
would
altogether
give
up
the
question
of
and
be
content
with
certificates
of
proficiency
they
would
try
to
meet
our
views
in
reply
i
represented
to
the
court
that
no
were
recognised
by
the
medical
act
and
that
any
such
documents
would
therefore
be
perfectly
useless
to
us
i
further
urged
that
as
matriculation
fees
had
been
exacted
from
us
in
addition
to
the
fees
for
tuition
and
as
we
had
been
required
to
pass
the
preliminary
examination
the
medical
and
as
some
of
our
own
number
had
moreover
passed
the
first
professional
examination
i
could
not
but
believe
that
we
were
entitled
to
demand
the
means
of
completing
the
ordinary
university
education
with
a
view
to
obtaining
the
ordinary
degree
such
belief
being
moreover
confirmed
by
the
emphatic
opinion
of
very
distinguished
counsel
on
these
grounds
i
entreated
the
court
to
reconsider
their
decision
and
made
the
following
suggestion
as
the
main
difficulty
before
your
honourable
court
seems
to
be
that
regarding
graduation
with
which
we
are
not
immediately
concerned
at
this
moment
we
are
quite
willing
to
rest
our
claims
to
ultimate
graduation
on
the
facts
as
they
stand
up
to
the
present
date
and
in
case
your
honourable
court
will
now
make
arrangements
whereby
we
can
continue
our
education
we
will
undertake
not
to
draw
any
arguments
in
favour
of
our
right
to
graduation
from
such
future
arrangements
so
that
they
may
at
least
be
made
without
prejudice
to
the
present
legal
position
of
the
i
appeal
to
every
intelligent
man
and
woman
to
say
whether
these
words
taken
in
connection
with
my
previous
argument
were
in
the
slightest
degree
ambiguous
or
whether
any
doubt
could
really
exist
that
in
them
i
was
pleading
for
facilities
for
such
an
education
as
would
ultimately
enable
us
to
become
legal
practitioners
of
medicine
although
i
was
willing
that
the
actual
question
of
graduation
should
remain
in
abeyance
for
a
few
months
till
decided
by
legal
authority
or
otherwise
the
public
evidently
so
understood
my
letter
which
was
published
in
the
papers
for
it
was
considered
that
i
had
substantially
gained
my
end
when
the
following
reply
from
the
secretary
of
the
court
was
also
published
am
desired
to
inform
you
that
you
appear
to
ask
no
more
than
was
offered
by
the
court
in
their
resolution
of
the
ultimo
in
which
it
was
stated
that
while
the
court
were
restrained
by
legal
doubts
as
to
the
power
of
the
university
to
grant
degrees
to
women
from
considering
expediency
of
taking
steps
to
obtain
in
favour
of
female
students
an
alteration
of
an
ordinance
which
might
be
held
not
to
apply
to
women
they
were
the
same
time
desirous
to
remove
so
far
as
possible
any
present
obstacle
in
the
way
of
a
complete
medical
education
being
given
to
women
provided
always
that
medical
instruction
to
women
be
imparted
in
strictly
separate
on
the
assumption
therefore
that
while
you
at
present
decline
the
offer
made
by
the
court
with
reference
to
certificates
of
proficiency
you
now
ask
merely
that
arrangements
should
be
made
for
completing
the
medical
education
of
yourself
and
the
other
ladies
on
behalf
of
whom
you
write
i
am
to
state
that
the
court
are
quite
ready
to
meet
your
views
if
therefore
the
names
of
teachers
of
the
required
medical
subjects
be
submitted
by
yourself
or
by
the
senatus
the
court
will
be
prepared
to
consider
the
respective
fitness
of
the
persons
so
named
to
be
authorised
to
hold
medical
classes
for
women
who
have
in
this
or
former
sessions
been
matriculated
students
of
the
university
and
also
the
conditions
and
regulations
under
which
such
classes
should
be
held
it
is
however
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
such
arrangements
are
not
to
be
founded
on
as
implying
any
right
in
women
to
obtain
medical
degrees
or
as
conferring
any
such
right
upon
the
students
referred
my
friends
as
i
say
congratulated
me
on
this
apparently
important
concession
but
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
i
resolved
to
have
absolute
official
confirmation
of
the
apparent
meaning
of
the
resolution
and
therefore
addressed
another
letter
to
the
court
in
which
after
thanking
them
for
their
apparent
good
intentions
i
enquired
whether
i
was
correct
in
understanding
that
though
you
at
present
give
us
no
pledge
respecting
our
ultimate
graduation
it
is
your
intention
to
consider
the
proposed
courses
as
for
graduation
and
that
you
will
take
such
measures
as
may
be
necessary
to
secure
that
they
will
be
so
accepted
if
it
is
subsequently
determined
that
the
university
has
the
power
of
granting
degrees
to
women
that
we
shall
be
admitted
in
due
course
to
the
ordinary
professional
examinations
on
presentation
of
the
proper
certificates
of
attendance
on
the
said
in
reply
i
was
calmly
informed
that
the
court
meant
nothing
of
the
kind
that
they
would
not
agree
to
count
any
classes
we
might
take
as
qualifying
and
that
in
fact
they
would
not
stir
a
finger
in
any
way
whatever
to
enable
us
to
become
legally
qualified
doctors
though
they
might
if
we
spent
a
good
many
years
of
labour
and
a
quite
unlimited
sum
of
money
in
obtaining
our
education
give
us
at
the
end
these
wonderful
certificates
of
proficiency
which
would
be
worth
exactly
nothing
what
had
been
the
meaning
of
the
previous
letter
of
apparent
concession
i
confess
myself
quite
at
a
loss
to
conceive
what
advantage
could
accrue
to
us
from
submitting
the
names
of
extramural
teachers
to
the
court
in
which
professor
christison
was
the
only
medical
man
i
have
never
been
able
to
guess
since
the
court
did
not
intend
to
take
any
means
to
make
their
teaching
qualify
for
graduation
and
we
hardly
needed
its
sanction
in
order
to
make
private
arrangements
for
instruction
one
is
inclined
to
wonder
whether
the
idea
was
that
the
university
court
possessed
some
supernatural
power
analogous
to
that
supposed
by
certain
churches
to
reside
in
episcopal
laying
on
of
hands
which
would
in
a
miraculous
way
benefit
those
lecturers
whom
they
might
to
teach
us
though
such
teaching
was
to
be
given
in
place
and
manner
wholly
unconnected
with
that
university
with
which
i
had
supposed
their
functions
to
be
exclusively
connected
however
i
am
content
to
leave
this
among
the
unexplained
mysteries
with
very
hearty
thankfulness
that
at
least
by
timely
enquiries
we
saved
ourselves
from
a
still
more
hopeless
waste
of
time
and
money
which
indeed
we
were
on
the
point
of
incurring
in
reliance
on
the
good
faith
of
the
court
and
the
apparent
meaning
of
its
mysterious
resolution
having
however
at
length
arrived
at
a
certainty
that
the
medical
faculty
would
rest
with
nothing
short
of
our
expulsion
if
by
any
possibility
they
could
attain
that
end
that
the
senatus
though
far
more
friendly
had
not
a
sufficient
majority
of
liberal
votes
to
secure
the
permanent
concession
of
our
claims
however
just
in
the
teeth
of
the
strong
medical
opposition
and
that
the
university
court
would
offer
only
such
concessions
as
were
quite
valueless
for
our
end
it
became
clear
that
it
was
useless
to
prolong
the
series
of
supplications
which
had
for
nearly
a
year
been
addressed
in
vain
to
one
after
another
of
the
the
ruling
powers
of
the
university
on
the
other
hand
we
had
no
less
authority
than
that
of
the
lord
advocate
of
scotland
for
believing
that
we
were
absolutely
entitled
to
what
we
had
so
humbly
solicited
and
that
a
court
of
law
would
quietly
award
to
us
what
seemed
unattainable
by
any
other
means
we
had
the
very
widely
spread
and
daily
increasing
sympathy
of
the
community
at
large
and
received
constant
offers
of
help
from
friends
of
every
kind
who
were
none
the
less
inclined
to
befriend
us
because
our
opponents
stood
in
high
places
and
were
utterly
relentless
in
their
aims
and
reckless
in
their
means
under
these
circumstances
we
have
done
the
one
thing
that
remained
for
us
to
do
we
have
brought
an
action
of
declarator
against
the
senatus
of
the
university
praying
to
have
it
declared
that
the
senatus
is
bound
in
some
way
or
other
to
enable
us
to
complete
our
education
and
to
proceed
to
the
medical
degree
which
will
entitle
us
to
take
place
on
the
medical
register
among
the
legally
qualified
practitioners
of
medicine
by
this
action
it
will
be
decided
once
more
to
quote
our
great
champion
the
whether
indeed
university
can
with
formal
solemnity
and
with
the
concurrence
of
all
its
component
parts
decree
the
admission
of
women
to
study
for
the
profession
of
medicine
and
then
deny
them
access
to
those
means
by
which
alone
they
can
enter
that
profession
whether
indeed
a
university
is
absolved
from
all
duties
towards
such
of
its
matriculated
students
as
may
have
the
misfortune
to
be
women
it
will
have
to
be
decided
whether
any
corporate
body
can
make
a
contract
of
which
all
the
obligations
are
on
one
side
and
can
exact
fees
and
demand
obedience
to
regulations
without
in
its
turn
incurring
any
responsibility
and
can
at
pleasure
finally
send
empty
away
those
whose
presence
is
inconvenient
without
any
regard
to
the
money
and
time
and
labour
which
they
have
expended
in
simple
reliance
upon
its
good
it
is
a
very
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
find
that
some
of
the
most
illustrious
members
of
the
senatus
have
expressed
their
own
opinion
on
these
points
in
the
most
emphatic
way
for
they
have
refused
utterly
to
be
parties
to
the
defence
of
this
action
and
have
entered
on
the
record
a
minute
from
which
i
extract
the
following
passage
dissent
from
and
protest
against
the
resolution
of
the
senatus
of
march
to
undertake
the
defence
of
the
action
this
we
do
for
the
following
reasons
because
we
see
no
just
cause
for
opposing
the
admission
of
women
to
the
study
and
practice
of
medicine
but
on
the
contrary
consider
that
women
who
have
honourably
marked
out
such
a
course
of
life
for
themselves
ought
to
be
forwarded
and
aided
in
their
laudable
endeavour
as
much
as
possible
by
all
who
have
the
means
and
especially
by
those
having
authority
in
any
university
or
other
institution
for
education
because
in
particular
we
feel
such
aid
and
encouragement
rather
than
opposition
and
discouragement
to
be
due
from
us
to
those
women
who
have
enrolled
themselves
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
and
we
entirely
concur
with
respect
to
them
in
the
desire
expressed
by
sir
william
the
rector
of
the
university
that
they
should
obtain
what
they
ask
namely
a
complete
medical
education
crowned
by
a
degree
because
we
have
seen
no
sufficient
reason
to
doubt
the
legal
and
constitutional
powers
of
our
university
to
make
arrangements
that
would
be
perfectly
adequate
for
the
purpose
and
we
consider
the
public
questioning
of
such
powers
in
present
circumstances
by
the
university
itself
or
any
of
its
component
bodies
unnecessary
impolitic
and
capable
of
being
construed
as
a
surrender
of
permanent
rights
and
privileges
of
the
university
in
order
to
evade
a
temporary
difficulty
because
without
pronouncing
an
opinion
on
the
question
now
raised
as
to
the
legal
rights
which
the
pursuers
have
acquired
by
matriculation
in
the
university
admission
already
to
certain
examinations
or
otherwise
to
demand
from
the
university
continued
medical
instruction
and
the
degree
on
due
qualification
we
yet
believe
that
they
have
thereby
and
by
the
general
tenor
of
the
proceedings
both
of
the
senatus
and
of
the
university
court
in
their
case
hitherto
acquired
a
moral
right
and
created
a
public
expectation
which
the
university
is
bound
to
meet
by
the
full
exercise
of
its
powers
in
their
behalf
even
should
it
be
with
some
trouble
because
with
these
convictions
and
notwithstanding
our
utmost
respect
for
those
of
our
colleagues
from
whom
we
may
have
the
misfortune
to
differ
on
the
subject
we
should
individually
feel
ashamed
of
appearing
as
defenders
in
such
an
action
and
should
account
any
such
public
appearance
by
us
in
the
character
of
opponents
to
women
desiring
to
enter
an
honoured
and
useful
profession
a
matter
to
our
the
following
are
the
names
of
the
six
professors
who
have
taken
this
memorable
stand
john
hughes
bennett
professor
of
institutes
of
medicine
david
masson
professor
of
rhetoric
and
english
literature
henry
calderwood
professor
of
moral
philosophy
james
lorimer
professor
of
public
law
archibald
charteris
professor
of
biblical
criticism
and
biblical
antiquities
and
william
ballantine
hodgson
professor
of
political
economy
and
so
i
have
brought
down
as
clearly
and
as
briefly
as
i
have
been
able
the
history
of
this
great
struggle
to
the
present
moment
for
that
it
is
a
great
struggle
and
one
that
will
astound
most
of
those
who
may
read
these
lines
some
thirty
years
hence
i
think
no
thoughtful
person
will
deny
i
should
like
in
conclusion
to
say
a
very
few
words
on
two
only
of
the
general
questions
which
are
bound
up
with
the
final
solution
of
the
problem
of
the
medical
education
of
women
and
first
as
to
the
difficulties
which
are
or
are
not
inherent
in
the
admission
of
women
to
a
university
and
especially
in
them
studying
in
mixed
classes
i
believe
most
firmly
that
if
when
we
first
applied
for
admission
in
edinburgh
we
had
simply
been
given
the
ordinary
tickets
and
if
either
no
notice
had
been
taken
of
our
entering
the
classes
or
the
other
students
had
been
invited
as
they
were
by
dr
alleyne
nicholson
to
join
in
welcoming
us
to
their
midst
no
difficulties
would
ever
have
arisen
at
all
or
at
least
no
difficulties
but
might
have
been
most
easily
smoothed
away
by
any
manly
teacher
with
a
real
reverence
for
his
subject
and
a
belief
in
the
profound
purity
of
science
i
am
sure
that
in
theory
it
is
both
possible
and
right
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
study
in
the
same
classes
any
and
every
subject
which
they
need
to
learn
and
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
this
will
ultimately
be
the
usual
arrangement
as
civilization
advances
but
i
am
equally
certain
that
boys
of
a
low
social
class
of
small
mental
calibre
and
no
moral
training
are
utterly
unfit
to
be
admitted
to
a
mixed
class
and
i
confess
that
i
was
most
painfully
surprised
in
edinburgh
to
find
how
large
a
number
there
are
of
medical
students
who
come
under
this
description
i
had
honestly
supposed
as
i
wrote
three
years
ago
that
ladies
need
fear
no
discomfort
in
an
ordinary
medical
class
as
majority
of
the
students
would
always
be
i
regret
that
on
this
point
i
have
been
compelled
somewhat
to
modify
my
opinion
though
i
would
fain
hope
that
the
circumstances
which
obliged
me
to
do
so
were
to
a
great
extent
exceptional
and
local
nor
do
i
think
it
possible
that
a
mixed
class
can
be
satisfactorily
conducted
by
any
man
who
is
not
capable
of
inspiring
his
students
with
a
reverence
for
purity
or
who
does
not
naturally
teach
them
alike
by
example
and
precept
that
the
fear
of
competition
is
essentially
low
and
mean
and
that
the
acme
of
degradation
is
reached
when
strength
of
any
kind
is
used
for
the
injury
or
annoyance
of
the
weaker
or
less
protected
and
this
being
so
i
acquiesce
very
heartily
in
the
decision
that
at
present
wherever
professors
and
students
think
it
necessary
women
shall
be
taught
medicine
only
in
separate
classes
though
i
hope
even
in
my
to
see
the
day
when
such
regulations
are
no
longer
required
because
students
and
teachers
alike
have
risen
to
a
higher
moral
level
in
the
meantime
let
us
but
be
granted
permission
to
acquire
our
knowledge
in
separate
classes
at
whatever
cost
and
the
authorities
may
be
very
sure
that
we
shall
not
trouble
them
with
requests
again
to
be
subjected
to
the
unsavoury
companionship
of
which
we
had
such
full
experience
in
and
lastly
with
regard
to
future
legislation
respecting
medical
practice
i
would
say
but
one
word
it
is
clearly
right
that
for
the
protection
of
the
helpless
and
ignorant
the
state
should
take
means
to
distinguish
between
competent
and
incompetent
practitioners
of
medicine
and
i
hope
that
women
as
well
as
men
will
always
be
required
very
thoroughly
to
prove
their
fitness
for
practice
before
they
are
allowed
to
undertake
it
at
least
under
national
sanction
but
it
is
not
in
the
least
for
the
good
of
the
nation
that
any
monopoly
should
be
encouraged
whether
in
matters
of
teaching
examination
or
practice
is
it
not
simply
shameful
that
all
that
i
have
now
been
relating
should
be
in
this
country
and
possible
because
of
a
law
which
appoints
but
one
door
to
the
medical
profession
that
of
registration
limits
registration
to
those
who
have
passed
through
certain
definite
schools
and
satisfied
certain
definite
boards
and
yet
allows
those
schools
and
boards
absolute
power
to
shut
their
doors
on
of
the
human
race
and
that
even
in
the
case
of
universities
largely
subsidised
from
public
funds
and
at
a
time
when
the
public
are
positively
clamouring
for
women
doctors
for
women
we
can
see
plainly
enough
why
it
is
in
the
lowest
sense
the
interest
of
medical
men
to
exclude
women
from
their
profession
though
thank
god
there
are
hundreds
of
medical
men
who
would
scorn
to
put
their
interests
in
one
scale
when
justice
weighed
down
the
other
but
it
is
the
interest
of
the
public
or
of
the
nation
to
sanction
any
such
monopoly
it
is
their
interest
to
throw
open
the
gates
of
competition
as
widely
as
possible
insisting
only
on
a
uniform
standard
of
attainment
for
all
of
either
sex
who
would
enter
them
for
by
thus
increasing
the
supply
of
really
competent
doctors
they
give
themselves
the
best
possible
opportunities
of
selection
and
as
i
have
pointed
out
elsewhere
they
double
the
chances
of
growth
and
advance
in
the
fields
of
medical
science
when
this
momentous
question
again
comes
before
parliament
i
trust
that
the
issues
involved
will
be
fully
realised
and
that
while
providing
for
the
most
stringent
examination
of
every
candidate
no
arbitrary
barrier
will
be
placed
in
the
way
of
any
and
no
regulations
be
allowed
to
stand
which
militate
against
the
good
old
english
motto
for
all
a
fair
field
and
no
favour
footnotes
by
this
act
a
court
of
examiners
was
appointed
and
declared
to
be
to
examine
all
person
or
persons
applying
to
them
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
skill
or
abilities
of
such
person
or
persons
in
the
science
of
medicine
and
his
or
their
fitness
and
qualification
to
practise
as
apothecaries
it
being
however
stipulated
that
all
candidates
so
applying
should
have
gone
through
certain
preliminary
studies
and
apprenticeship
the
classes
attended
by
miss
garrett
in
common
with
the
other
students
were
as
follows
chemistry
practical
chemistry
materia

botany
zoology
and
natural
philosophy

must
have
uncommon
sweetness
of
disposition
and
manners
to
be

possessing
superior
talents

miss
elizabeth
smith
by
in
the
year
the
question
was
formally
asked
of
the
italian
government
whether
women
were
legally
entitled
to
study
in
the
universities
and
the
answer
was
in
the
affirmative
the
university
court
consists
of
the
rector
the
principal
and
the
lord
provost
of
edinburgh
with
five
others
appointed
respectively
by
the
chancellor
the
rector
the
senatus
the
of
edinburgh
and
the
general
council
of
the
university
on
this
point
i
may
quote
the
following
passage
from
the
whose
great
influence
has
always
been
most
nobly
exerted
in
this
question
on
the
side
of
justice
and
liberality
and
to
whose
help
in
arousing
the
moral
sense
of
the
community
we
owe
a
debt
that
we
can
never
hope
to
pay
the
words
quoted
occur
in
a
leading
article
referring
to
a
meeting
of
the
general
council
of
which
mention
will
be
found
elsewhere
dr
christison
who
is
well
known
to
be
in
truth
the
very
soul
and
centre
of
the
opposition
and
whose
personal
influence
alone
has
probably
prevailed
to
carry
it
on
so
long
in
the
teeth
of
public
opinion
thought
it
advisable
to
say
at
the
council
meeting
that
anything
could
be
done
to
get
the
ladies
out
of
their
difficulty
he
should
be
glad
to
be
one
to
give
them
this
expression
sounds
somewhat
farcical
to
those
who
are
aware
that
the
present
arises
simply
from
the
fact
that
the
studies
have
now
brought
them
to
that
point
at
which
dr
class
comes
next
in
turn
to
be
attended
and
that
the
professor
in
spite
of
his
verbal
gallantry
has
flatly
refused
either
to
instruct
them
himself
or
facilitate
arrangements
by
which
any
one
can
do
so
in
his
october
as
some
attempts
have
been
lately
made
to
throw
doubt
on
the
validity
of
the
regulations
just
quoted
and
in
fact
on
the
legality
of
the
matriculation
of
women
i
think
it
well
to
specify
distinctly
certain
of
the
persons
who
were
most
immediately
concerned
in
the
university
action
just
described
the
university
court
which
drew
up
the
above
regulations
contained
among
its
members
mr
moncreiff
then
lord
advocate
of
scotland
and
mr
gordon
who
had
held
the
same
office
under
a
previous
government
besides
two
other
legal
members
the
chancellor
who
gave
his
express
sanction
to
all
the
measures
taken
was
lord
glencorse
inglis
the
lord
of
scotland
i
leave
the
public
to
judge
how
far
it
is
probable
that
these
gentlemen
conjoined
to
do
an
illegal
and
invalid
act
on
behalf
of
the
university
i
fully
agree
in
the
following
remarks
made
by
a
local
paper
when
the
results
of
the
next
summer
term
were
declared
whole
number
of
gentlemen
who
appear
in
the
in
botany
are
out
of
competitors
about
per
cent
of
the
ladies
we
believe
that
these
results
prove
not
that
capacities
are
better
than
those
of
men
a
thing
that
few
people
would
assert
but
that
these
women
who
are
devoting
themselves
to
obtain
in
spite
of
all
difficulties
a
thorough
knowledge
of
their
profession
are
far
more
thoroughly
in
earnest
than
most
of
the
men
are
and
that
their
ultimate
success
is
certain
in
proportion
nor
would
we
omit
the
inference
that
this
being
so
those
who
wantonly
throw
obstacles
in
the
way
of
this
gallant
little
band
incur
a
proportionately
heavy
responsibility
as
wanting
not
only
in
the
spirit
of
chivalry
but
even
in
the
love
of
fair
play
which
we
should
be
sorry
to
think
wanting
in
any
august
compare
miss
experience
i
am
told
that
on
this
occasion
the
obstructives
of
the
day
actually
shut
the
college
gates
on
the
ladies
but
that
the
gallant
old
professor
nothing
daunted
admitted
them
through
a
window
in
south
college
street
see
the
following
passage
occurs
in
a
leading
article
on
the
riot
got
up
in
philadelphia
by
male
medical
students
when
in
ladies
were
first
admitted
to
the
pennsylvania
hospital
riotous
procedure
is
just
a
manifestation
of
the
same
spirit
that
will
stoop
to
any
meanness
join
in
any
tyranny
be
guilty
of
any
cruelty
rather
than
allow
interference
with
what
is
considered
as
its
in
last
we
find
a
letter
from
a
medical
man
who
asks
with
surprise
whether
the
advocates
of
female
physicians
can
possibly
be
aware
that
there
are
hundreds
of
medical
not
able
to
make
a
comfortable
living
we
know
not
which
most
to
admire
the
cool
assumption
that
the
medical
profession
exists
only
or
mainly
to
fill
the
pockets
of
its
members
or
the
serene
assurance
that
takes
it
for
granted
that
no
woman
has
a
right
to
expect
to
be
allowed
the
chance
of
earning
a
living
till
all
male
competitors
are
safely
and
sufficiently
provided
for
it
is
rather
amusing
to
contrast
the
evidently
keen
dread
of
successful
competition
which
degrades
a
man
thus
to
plead
formâ
with
the
voluble
assurances
in
this
and
other
medical
papers
that
nature
has
clearly
interdicted
to
women
the
practice
of
medicine
and
that
here
at
least
they
can
not
but
utterly
april
see
answer
to
an
incorrect
statement
which
appeared
in
one
of
the
medical
papers
respecting
his
class
dr
alleyne
nicholson
has
forwarded
to
its
editor
a
letter
from
which
we
extract
the
following
passage
course
of
lectures
on
zoology
which
i
am
now
delivering
to
a
mixed
class
is
identically
the
same
as
the
course
which
i
delivered
last
winter
to
my
ordinary
class
of
male
students
i
have
not
hitherto
emasculated
my
lectures
in
any
way
whatsoever
nor
have
i
the
smallest
intention
of
so
doing
in
so
acting
i
am
guided
by
the
firm
conviction
that
little
stress
is
to
be
laid
on
the
purity
and
modesty
of
those
who
find
themselves
able
to
extract
food
for
improper
feelings
from
such
a
purely
scientific
subject
as
zoology
however
freely
handled
the
pure
all
things
are
in
the
moral
courage
and
manly
purity
of
the
above
letter
we
find
fresh
cause
to
congratulate
the
ladies
on
the
teacher
they
have
secured
on
a
subject
which
might
easily
have
been
made
offensive
by
a
man
of
prurient
mind
as
teachers
of
truly
scientific
spirit
become
more
common
we
shall
doubtless
hear
less
and
less
of
the
difficulties
of
giving
instruction
to
classes
composed
of
medical
students
of
both
june
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
hardly
a
year
later
a
majority
of
these
lecturers
were
so
overborne
by
the
prevailing
medical
influence
that
they
rescinded
the
above
regulations
merely
permissive
as
they
were
and
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
the
gentlemen
whose
classes
we
had
attended
passed
a
resolution
forbidding
any
of
their
number
to
instruct
lady
students
either
in
mixed
or
separate
classes
in
hall
that
no
doubt
whatever
might
remain
as
to
the
which
dictated
this
resolution
they
distinctly
confined
the
prohibition
to
the
case
of
ladies
were
registered
students
of
expressly
allowing
the
continued
instruction
of
midwives
i
wish
that
space
would
permit
of
my
quoting
the
remarks
made
on
this
occasion
by
the
of
july
and
by
other
papers
see
see
this
mob
was
not
wholly
or
mainly
composed
of
our
at
hall
though
a
few
of
them
were
present
the
larger
number
however
belonged
to
the
lowest
class
of
university
students
who
had
been
summoned
together
by
an
anonymous
missive
circulated
in
the
the
same
morning
see
it
is
worth
remark
that
for
the
first
time
within
memory
lady
contributors
used
their
right
of
voting
on
this
occasion
and
it
is
tolerably
significant
that
more
than
a
dozen
voted
on
our
behalf
and
not
one
against

the
number
of
doctors
who
voted
for
us
was
three
or
four
against
us
more
than
twenty
the
text
of
the
petition
was
as
follows
the
court
of
contributors
to
the
royal
and
gentlemen
we
the
undersigned
women
of
edinburgh
not
being
able
to
attend
the
meeting
at
which
the
admission
of
female
medical
students
to
the
infirmary
will
be
discussed
desire
hereby
to
express
our
great
interest
in
the
issues
involved
and
our
earnest
hope
that
full
facilities
for
hospital
study
will
be
afforded
by
the
managers
to
all
women
who
desire
to
enter
the
medical
see
several
of
the
principal
citizens
including
the
senior
member
for
edinburgh
had
spoken
strongly
on
our
behalf
at
the
meetings
just
mentioned
indeed
it
has
been
remarkable
throughout
how
strongly
the
municipal
element
has
been
on
our
side
while
the
leaders
of
the
opposition
have
with
hardly
an
exception
been
medical
men
and
their
immediate
friends
and
followers
see
see
see
see
on
a
subsequent
very
similar
occasion
the
remarked
may
be
noticed
that
this
is
the
third
time
that
startling
announcements
have
been
fired
at
the
lady
students
on
the
very
eve
of
important
examinations
possibly
with
the
professional
view
of
testing
the
soundness
of
their
march
the
text
of
the
resolution
was
as
follows
in
the
opinion
of
this
council
the
university
authorities
have
by
published
resolutions
induced
women
to
commence
the
study
of
medicine
at
the
university
that
these
women
having
prosecuted
their
studies
to
a
certain
length
are
prevented
from
completing
them
from
want
of
adequate
provision
being
made
for
their
instruction
that
this
council
without
again
pronouncing
any
opinion
on
the
advisability
of
women
studying
medicine
do
represent
to
the
university
court
that
after
what
the
senatus
and
court
have
already
done
they
are
at
least
bound
in
honour
and
justice
to
render
it
possible
for
those
women
who
have
already
commenced
their
studies
to
complete
october
i
am
assured
by
mrs
henry
kingsley
who
kindly
acted
as
to
this
memorial
that
the
signatures
might
have
been
multiplied
tenfold
had
any
organized
effort
been
made
to
obtain
them
by
means
of
paid
agents
taking
the
papers
from
house
to
house
edinburgh
school
has
come
badly
out
of
its
imbroglio
with
the
lady
students
the
motion
of
dr
alexander
wood
to
which
we
made
reference
last
week
was
negatived
by
a
majority
of
ten
as
we
then
pointed
out
the
issue
before
the
general
council
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
this
to
keep
faith
with
the
female
students
whom
the
university
had
allowed
to
proceed
two
years
in
their
medical
curriculum
the
council
was
not
asked
to
commit
itself
in
the
slightest
degree
to
any
opinion
favourable
or
unfavourable
to
the
admission
of
ladies
to
a
medical
career
it
had
only
to
concede
in
common
courtesy
not
to
say
common
fairness
the
right
to
which
the
best
legal
advice
had
clearly
shown
the
female
students
to
be
entitled
the
right
to
carry
on
the
studies
they
had
been
allowed
to
prosecute
half
way
towards
graduation
will
it
be
believed
an
amendment
postponing
the
settlement
of
the
difficulty
till
it
had
been
duly
considered
by
the
authorities
of
the
university
was
put
and
carried
as
if
there
was
any
more
room
for
in
the
matter
thus
edinburgh
stands
convicted
of
having
acted
unfairly
towards
seven
ladies
whom
she
first
accepted
as
pupils
and
then
stopped
in
their
mattered
nothing
that
firms
had
voted
ever
since
the
infirmary
was
founded
that
contributors
qualified
only
as
members
of
firms
had
as
has
now
been
ascertained
sat
over
and
over
again
on
the
board
of
management
and
on
the
committee
of
contributors
it
was
of
equally
slight
importance
that
the
firms
whom
it
was
now
sought
to
disqualify
had
been
among
the
most
generous
benefactors
of
the
charity
and
that
with
the
imminent
prospect
before
them
of
great
pecuniary
necessity
it
would
probably
be
impossible
without
their
aid
to
carry
out
even
the
plans
for
the
new
building
the
firms
had
voted
in
favour
of
the
ladies
and
the
firms
must
go
if
at
least
the
law
would
as
it
probably
will
not
bear
out
the
medical
men
in
their
reckless
endeavour
to
expel
january
at
this
meeting
a
committee
of
contributors
previously
appointed
reported
in
favour
of
the
admission
of
lady
students
and
against
the
exclusion
of
the
votes
of
firms
and
this
report
was
approved
by
votes
to
on
this
occasion
there
voted
for
the
approval
of
the
report
ladies
and
doctors
against
it
ladies
doctors
and
druggists
see
see
in
support
of
this
suggestion
the
court
remarked
that
the
question
had
been
needlessly
by
the
introduction
of
the
subject
of
graduation
which
is
not
essential
to
the
completion
of
a
medical
or
other
they
however
to
mention
that
though
a
degree
is
to
a
medical
education
it
absolutely
indispensable
to
any
practical
use
of
it
that
is
to
say
to
any
lawful
practice
of
the
medical
profession
the
correspondence
above
referred
to
is
given
in
march
may
though
a
majority
of
the
senatus
did
decide
to
defend
the
action
i
believe
that
it
is
understood
that
such
decision
did
not
imply
on
the
part
of
all
who
acquiesced
in
it
any
moral
conviction
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
obtain
the
desired
declarator
since
several
other
professors
appear
to
have
agreed
in
feeling
with
the
six
dissentients
but
to
have
acquiesced
in
the
defence
of
the
action
for
the
sake
of
having
a
formal
legal
decision
given
on
one
side
or
the
other
am
bold
enough
to
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
art
of
healing
which
may
not
fitly
be
spoken
of
before
an
audience
of
both
sexes
provided
there
be
a
generally
good
tone
prevailing
among
them
and
the
lecturer
be
of
a
pure
and
manly
spirit
indeed
i
will
go
farther
and
say
that
his
example
in
treating
subjects
of
the
kind
incidental
to
his
work
with
equal
purity
and
courage
will
be
far
from
the
least
valuable
part
of
his
teaching
it
will
bring
home
to
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
with
more
force
than
any
other
argument
the
truth
that
every
creature
every
ordinance
of
god
is
good

compare
with
the
above
the
following
statement
made
by
an
edinburgh
medical
student
in
the
columns
of
the
beg
leave
to
relate
what
i
myself
listened
to
in
a
of
the
university
during
the
last
summer
session
on
the
occasion
to
which
i
refer
the
professor
went
a
long
way
beyond
the
requirements
of
scientific
teaching
into
the
regions
of
but
indelicate
narrative
in
order
that
he
might
appropriately
introduce
remarks
to
the
following
effect
gentlemen
i
have
minutely
described
to
you
those
interesting
incidents
which
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
notice
if
women
were
present
and
i
hope
that
we
may
be
long
spared
the
annoyance
which
their
presence
here
would
inflict
upon
the
tempest
of
applause
that
followed
showed
only
too
well
the
harmony
which
existed
between
teacher
and
pupils
on
points
that
would
have
been
far
better
left
december
see
as
a
profession
for
truth
is
a
class
of
young
men
inferior
socially
to
their
predecessors
of
ten
years
ago
now
resort
to
the
edinburgh
school
which
has
lost
much
of
its
attractiveness
now
that
london
and
other
seats
of
learning
are
so
well
appointed
and
so
efficiently
february
omnia
munda
neither
ladies
nor
lecturers
are
conscious
of
or
of
can
it
be
that
the
unruly
students
are
only
upon
dean
principle
because
they
are
see
wrong
done
to
individuals
by
denying
them
the
training
necessary
to
the
pursuit
of
a
branch
of
knowledge
and
the
practice
of
an
art
for
which
they
may
have
a
special
taste
and
capacity
is
very
great
and
it
involves
a
wrong
not
less
signal
to
society
in
limiting
the
sources
whence
good
may
come
to
notes
note
a
the
following
are
a
few
only
out
of
many
indications
of
the
existence
of
the
painful
feeling
alluded
to
in
the
text
the
reader
will
hardly
need
to
be
reminded
that
this
is
especially
a
subject
respecting
which
a
maximum
of
feeling
may
well
exist
with
a
minimum
of
expression
for
hardly
anything
but
a
sense
of
duty
would
make
a
woman
write
on
such
a
question
to
the
newspapers
there
remains
to
be
considered
the
modesty
and
delicacy
of
the
patients
a
question
hardly
yet
mooted
these
poor
women
having
i
suppose
too
much
of
the
reality
to
raise
the
point
it
can
not
be
denied
that
at
least
of
the
patients
of
medical
men
are
women
or
that
usually
from
natural
causes
they
require
medical
services
more
certainly
and
frequently
than
men
and
operations
delicate
or
indelicate
so
called
must
be
performed
questions
delicate
or
indelicate
must
be
asked
and
answered
too
if
not
by
the
patient
herself
by
the
nurse
who
i
believe
is
usually
a
woman
is
much
reason
to
believe
that
many
women
either
owing
to
the
nature
of
their
malady
or
from
constitutional
nervousness
or
reserve
never
avail
themselves
of
the
services
of
a
medical
man
without
reluctance
to
them
it
is
always
a
painful
effort
the
twentieth
time
as
much
as
the
first
it
would
i
think
be
odd
if
something
of
this
kind
were
not
felt
very
strongly
by
every
woman
on
some
occasions
and
i
have
seen
very
experienced
mothers
quite
distressed
if
by
any
chance
they
were
deprived
of
the
assistance
of
doctor
they
were
used
the
wives
of
medical
men
have
told
me
that
it
was
their
one
comfort
to
feel
that
in
their
hour
of
suffering
only
their
own
husband
and
a
good
nurse
need
be
with
them
i
think
this
is
not
letter
by
mall
may
happened
to
be
speaking
to
a
young
shopwoman
a
total
stranger
to
me
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
advised
her
to
seek
medical
advice
when
she
replied
with
a
sudden
gush
of
tears
in
her
eyes
that
she
been
in
the
infirmary
in
dr
matthews
wards
for
a
fortnight
and
had
during
that
time
suffered
so
much
from
the
constant
presence
of
crowds
of
male
students
during
certain
inevitable
but
most
unpleasant
examinations
of
her
person
that
as
she
herself
forcibly
expressed
it
almost
drove
me
a
new
obstacle
has
been
thrown
in
the
way
of
women
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
the
medical
profession
the
special
obstacle
at
present
is
injury
to
the
delicacy
of
mind
of
the
male
students
this
delicacy
if
real
must
be
a
serious
drawback
to
the
proper
exercise
of
their
profession
in
after
life
that
it
is
so
many
a
suffering
woman
knows
question
however
arises
which
evil
is
the
greater
that
five
hundred
youths
in
full
health
and
vigour
should
be
made
a
little
uncomfortable
by
the
presence
of
seven
women
or
that
seven
times
five
hundred
women
unnerved
by
suffering
should
be
subjected
to
the
very
trial
they
shrink
from
women
do
truly
shrink
from
this
trial
the
number
of
wretched
sufferers
from
chronic
disease
but
too
clearly
proves
it
is
only
when
racked
by
constant
pain
that
a
natural
delicacy
at
last
gives
way
often
only
to
hear
said
the
words
how
bitter
they
are
returns
of
the
could
easily
prove
the
vast
sacrifice
of
life
did
delicacy
not
again
step
in
with
and
liver
complaints
as
more
euphonious
terms
for
the
real
disorders
of
which
these
are
the
mere
objection
looked
at
fairly
is
a
case
of
the
delicacy
of
five
hundred
men
that
of
all
suffering
women
leave
the
fathers
and
husbands
of
edinburgh
to
judge
righteous
judgment
i
am
a
november
think
most
thoughtful
women
will
bear
testimony
to
the
amount
of
preventible
suffering
that
passes
unaided
because
the
natural
sensibilities
of
women
prevent
their
resorting
with
comfort
to
treatment
by
medical
men
for
certain
diseases
i
can
count
almost
by
dozens
the
cases
which
have
come
under
my
personal
observation
of
health
ruined
and
pleasures
and
usefulness
alike
lost
with
it
because
young
girls
and
sometimes
older
women
too
will
not
submit
to
receive
from
a
man
however
respected
the
personal
examination
and
treatment
necessary
for
their
restoration
and
because
no
skill
has
been
at
their
command
let
your
readers
divest
themselves
for
a
moment
of
conventional
habits
of
thought
and
inquire
what
would
then
be
their
instinctive
opinion
of
the
existing
custom
which
compels
one
sex
to
be
dependent
on
the
other
for
medical
treatment
of
the
most
delicate
kind
imagine
the
case
reversed
if
henceforth
women
alone
were
to
attend
on
men
what
would
the
world
say
to
that
at
any
rate
is
it
not
time
that
women
should
at
least
be
allowed
a
choice
in
this
matter
and
if
this
be
so
it
is
clear
that
some
women
must
be
thoroughly
educated
for
the
medical
profession
i
am
a
examiner
and
november
is
rarely
made
of
the
many
women
who
are
waiting
longingly
for
the
time
when
it
will
be
possible
for
them
to
consult
doctors
of
their
own
sex
when
they
will
no
longer
be
forced
at
the
risk
of
their
health
and
perhaps
life
to
consult
men
in
circumstances
under
which
their
natural
feelings
of
delicacy
revolt
but
i
am
sure
that
the
number
of
these
is
not
small
and
long
suffering
as
they
have
hitherto
been
their
voice
in
time
will
make
itself
heard
if
all
other
monitions
are
disregarded
i
am
a
woman
who
desires
a
woman
often
hear
of
the
possible
dislike
of
male
patients
to
the
presence
of
lady
students
but
let
us
also
give
the
weaker
sex
a
little
credit
for
these
same
feelings
of
modesty
and
decency
many
a
time
have
i
stood
by
the
bedside
of
poor
girls
who
seemed
ready
to
sink
under
the
shame
of
being
exposed
before
a
number
of
young
men
a
feeling
which
could
not
be
overcome
even
by
the
agony
of
the
operations
a
medical
edinburgh
in
the
present
controversy
regarding
the
extension
to
women
of
facilities
for
obtaining
a
complete
medical
education
it
is
reiterated
on
one
side
that
there
is
a
no
demand
among
women
themselves
for
doctors
of
their
own
sex
in
visiting
a
district
of
nine
families
in
a
poor
quarter
of
the
old
town
inhabited
principally
by
irish
i
found
four
women
seriously
out
of
health
not
so
seriously
however
but
that
they
might
have
been
cured
by
timely
medical
advice
i
urged
each
of
them
more
than
once
to
go
to
the
dispensary
but
all
persistently
refused
each
of
them
saying
in
different
words
that
if
ladies
were
doctors
as
they
had
heard
they
were
in
some
places
they
would
have
had
medical
advice
long
before
the
feelings
of
these
poor
women
were
so
strong
on
the
subject
that
i
found
it
was
useless
to
urge
them
further
it
seems
only
just
and
reasonable
that
qualified
female
medical
attendants
should
be
within
the
reach
of
those
who
either
have
a
strong
preference
for
it
or
who
will
not
avail
themselves
of
any
i
am
a
district
one
who
for
a
short
time
was
a
patient
under
a
late
very
eminent
doctor
of
edinburgh
i
say
that
i
believe
nothing
would
again
induce
me
to
do
what
i
then
did
in
ignorance
of
what
was
before
me
the
anguish
of
mind
suffered
silently
by
women
in
such
circumstances
is
not
to
be
described
and
is
likely
seriously
to
influence
the
effect
of
the
medical
treatment
it
is
surely
time
for
men
to
cease
to
speak
of
what
in
this
matter
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
know
what
women
will
never
tell
them
the
unwillingness
the
delay
often
which
precedes
their
stammered
request
for
advice
what
women
need
is
that
some
of
their
own
sex
should
have
the
power
of
qualifying
themselves
to
act
as
their
advisers
who
has
a
right
to
say
they
shall
not
when
the
voice
of
their
countrywomen
calls
on
them
to
do
it
i
am
an
june
note
b
in
answer
to
the
sufficiently
arrogant
enquiry
from
dr
henry
bennet
right
have
women
to
claim
mental
equality
with
men
i
addressed
the
following
letter
to
the

it
seems
to
me
to
sum
up
our
position
fairly
enough
i
here
reprint
it
edinburgh
june
i
see
in
your
columns
of
june
a
letter
on
as
practitioners
of
midwifery
and
appeal
to
your
sense
of
fairness
to
allow
me
a
fourth
part
of
the
space
it
occupied
for
a
few
words
in
reply
is
hardly
worth
while
to
discuss
the
early
part
of
the
letter
as
the
second
paragraph
sufficiently
disposes
of
the
first
after
saying
that
women
are
constitutionally
and
mentally
unfitted
for
hard
and
incessant
toil
dr
bennet
goes
on
to
propose
to
make
over
to
them
as
their
sole
share
of
the
medical
profession
what
he
himself
well
describes
as
its
arduous
most
wearing
and
most
unremunerative
in
the
last
adjective
seems
really
to
lie
the
whole
suitability
of
the
division
of
labour
according
to
the
view
he
evidently
thinks
that
capabilities
are
nicely
graduated
to
fit
or
midwifery
cases
and
that
all
patients
paying
a
larger
sum
of
necessity
need
the
superior
powers
of
the
mind
of
the
caucasian
let
whatever
is
well
paid
be
left
to
the
man
then
chivalrously
abandon
the
work
to
the
woman
this
is
the
genuine
view
of
a
true
it
is
well
for
once
to
hear
it
candidly
stated
as
i
trust
the
majority
of
medical
men
would
be
ashamed
of
avowing
such
a
principle
and
as
i
am
sure
it
would
be
indignantly
disavowed
by
the
general
public
i
do
not
care
to
say
more
on
this
point
when
dr
bennet
proceeds
to
dogmatise
about
what
he
calls
our
claim
to
equality
he
comes
to
a
different
and
much
more
important
question
i
for
one
do
not
care
in
the
least
either
to
claim
or
disown
such
equality
nor
do
i
see
that
it
is
at
all
essential
to
the
real
question
at
issue
allow
me
to
state
in
a
few
words
the
position
that
i
and
as
i
believe
most
of
my
fellow
students
take
we
say
to
the
authorities
of
the
medical
profession
clearly
what
attainments
you
consider
necessary
for
a
medical
practitioner
fix
your
standard
where
you
please
but
define
it
plainly
put
no
obstacles
in
our
way
either
afford
us
access
to
the
ordinary
means
of
medical
education
or
do
not
exact
that
we
shall
use
your
special
methods
in
either
case
subject
us
ultimately
to
exactly
the
ordinary
examinations
and
tests
and
if
we
fail
to
acquit
ourselves
as
well
as
your
average
students
reject
us
if
on
the
contrary
in
spite
of
all
difficulties
we
reach
your
standard
and
fulfil
all
your
requirements
the
question
of
is
practically
settled
so
far
as
it
concerns
our
case
give
us
then
the
ordinary
medical
license
or
diploma
and
leave
the
question
of
our
ultimate
success
or
failure
in
practice
to
be
decided
by
ourselves
and
the
this
is
our
position
and
i
appeal
not
to
the
chivalry
but
to
the
justice
of
the
medical
profession
to
show
us
that
it
is
untenable
or
else
to
concede
it
at
i
am
sir
your
obedient
servant
sophia
july
note
c
the
statement
in
the
text
was
made
the
subject
of
a
newspaper
controversy
and
i
append
the
following
very
valuable
evidence
which
was
thus
elicited
in
support
of
my
assertion
permit
me
to
bear
my
testimony
to
the
state
of
the
facts
on
this
question
as
far
as
english
convents
are
concerned
i
was
for
some
years
medical
attendant
to
a
franciscan
convent
and
was
frequently
consulted
by
the
nuns
they
were
examined
and
treated
like
other
patients
except
where
certain
maladies
were
concerned
and
then
they
suffered
in
silence
or
with
such
relief
as
could
be
given
by
medicines
after
a
diagnosis
founded
on
questions
and
general
symptoms
only
i
especially
remember
two
cases
in
neither
of
these
any
examination
was
permitted
or
any
surgical
treatment
regarded
as
a
possibility
in
spite
of
all
the
representations
i
could
make
and
although
i
believe
i
possessed
the
full
confidence
of
the
patients
and
of
the
superior
whether
a
female
surgeon
would
have
been
allowed
to
examine
and
operate
i
can
not
i
am
sir
yours
may
kindly
permit
me
to
say
a
few
words
with
regard
to
miss
statement
that
very
many
women
and
in
particular
nuns
would
certainly
show
a
preference
for
the
medical
and
surgical
aid
of
one
of
their
own
sex
were
any
choice
possible
to
them
as
being
myself
a
catholic
and
having
many
near
relatives
nuns
i
can
most
confidently
confirm
this
assertion
have
known
for
many
years
and
in
the
closest
intimacy
ladies
members
of
various
religious
orders
in
this
country
and
in
france
and
i
am
quite
aware
that
recourse
to
male
medical
advice
in
peculiar
cases
is
looked
upon
in
religious
houses
as
something
much
more
painful
than
any
physical
suffering
or
even
death
father
was
medical
attendant
to
a
convent
of
english
nuns
and
i
think
i
may
safely
say
that
any
advice
given
to
nuns
in
such
cases
was
entirely
at
second
hand
the
wife
being
the
favourite
resource
in
these
emergencies
again
how
can
any
man
medical
or
not
know
what
agonies
of
shame
and
outraged
modesty
women
can
and
do
undergo
when
submitting
to
male
medical
and
surgical
treatment
how
many
women
can
not
overcome
their
repugnance
and
die
with
their
special
ailments
unsuspected
or
discovered
too
late
on
the
other
hand
how
many
women
are
at
great
pains
to
the
shrinking
which
they
feel
when
exposing
their
peculiar
ailments
to
even
a
and
valued
medical
man
why
should
we
have
these
added
to
our
other
unavoidable
sufferings
the
reality
of
these
feelings
is
i
am
certain
within
the
personal
knowledge
of
every
one
of
your
female
readers
no
one
wishes
to
deny
modesty
to
the
stronger
sex
but
let
us
suppose
them
to
reveal
all
their
physical
ills
to
how
would
they
feel
i
am
a
catholic
wife
and
may
note
d
while
reviewing
the
above
for
the
press
may
the
following
lines
came
under
my
notice
and
i
think
them
the
more
suitable
to
quote
as
they
are
from
the
pen
of
a
woman
who
has
never
herself
shown
the
least
inclination
for
the
study
of
medicine
and
who
therefore
speaks
entirely
from
the
abstract
point
of
view
will
ever
make
me
believe
that
god
meant
men
to
be
the
ordinary
physicians
of
women
and
babies
a
few
masculine
experts
might
be
tolerated
in
special
institutions
so
that
cases
of
peculiar
danger
and
difficulty
might
not
be
left
as
they
are
now
to
the
necessarily
treatment
of
a
single
sex
but
in
general
if
ever
a
created
being
was
conspicuously
and
intolerably
out
of
his
natural
sphere
it
is
in
my
opinion
the
male
doctor
in
the
apartment
of
the
woman
and
i
think
our
sex
is
really
guilty
in
the
first
place
that
it
ever
allowed
man
to
appear
there
and
in
the
second
that
it
does
not
insist
upon
educating
women
of
character
and
intelligence
and
social
position
for
that
post
common
delicacy
would
seem
to
demand
that
all
the
special
diseases
of
women
should
be
treated
principally
by
women
but
this
aside
and
speaking
from
common
sense
only
men
may
be
as
scientific
as
they
please
it
is
plain
that
thoroughly
to
know
the
organism
what
is
good
for
it
and
what
evil
and
how
it
can
best
be
cured
when
it
is
disordered
one
must
be
self
a
woman
it
only
proves
how
much
unworthy
passion
and
prejudice
the
great
doctors
allow
to
intrude
into
their
adoration
of
and
boasted
love
of
humanity
that
instead
of
being
eager
to
enlist
the
feminine
intuitions
and
investigations
in
this
great
cause
as
their
best
chance
of
arriving
at
truth
they
are
actually
enacting
the
ignoble
part
of
churls
and
misers
if
not
of
quacks
for
are
they
not
well
enough
aware
that
often
their
women
patients
are
so
utterly
beyond
them
that
they
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
the
diseases
of
the
age
are
nervous
diseases
and
women
are
growing
more
nervously
and
uncontrollable
every
day
yet
the
doctors
stand
helplessly
by
and
can
not
stop
it
when
however
there
shall
be
a
school
of
doctresses
of
high
culture
and
thorough
medical
education
going
in
and
out
among
the
sex
with
the
proper
medical
authority
they
will
see
and
will
be
able
to
prevent
much
of
the
moral
and
physical
neglect
and
imprudence
which
now
unchecked
in
school
and
home
make
such
havoc
of
the
vital
forces
of
the
present
by
mrs
pierce
note
e
for
the
edification
of
the
next
generation
to
whom
all
this
bigotry
will
probably
appear
almost
incredible
i
subjoin
the
passage
alluded
to
in
the
text
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
is
by
no
means
the
worst
i
might
have
quoted
from
the
same
paper
ourselves
we
hold
that
the
admission
of
women
into
the
ranks
of
medicine
is
an
egregious
blunder
derogatory
to
the
status
and
character
of
the
female
sex
and
likely
to
be
injurious
in
the
highest
degree
to
the
interests
and
public
estimation
of
the
profession
which
they
seek
to
invade
insisting
on
the
attendance
of
all
students
at
the
delivery
of
anatomical
lectures
and
in
the
the
only
possible
guarantee
of
uniformity
of
teaching
will
be
obtained
and
at
the
same
time
a
difficulty
will
be
placed
in
the
way
of
female
intrusion
which
it
will
not
be
easy
for
women
of
character
and
clearly
none
else
are
eligible
to
surmount
we
hope
however
that
the
court
of
examiners
will
not
stop
with
the
erection
of
the
barrier
we
suggest
but
that
they
will
distinctly
refuse
to
admit
any
female
candidate
to
examination
unless
compelled
by
a
legal
decision
from
the
bench
and
we
also
hope
that
they
will
be
supported
in
such
refusal
by
the
master
and
wardens
of
the
society
as
well
as
by
the
profession
out
of
times
and
note
f
since
the
first
admission
of
women
to
the
university
of
zurich
in
five
women
have
taken
degrees
there
in
medicine
but
none
at
present
in
any
other
faculty
during
the
present
year
there
are
at
zurich
no
less
than
women
studying
in
the
medical
faculty
and
in
that
of
arts
note
g
at
last
the
vexed
question
of
mixed
classes
will
be
solved
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
those
who
have
ever
been
engaged
in
scientific
study
of
the
favourable
result
to
be
expected
it
is
curious
to
note
in
the
history
of
the
present
movement
how
one
after
another
old
objections
have
vanished
and
old
arguments
have
become
no
longer
available
it
is
pretty
certain
that
this
last
and
perhaps
greatest
to
the
minds
of
many
will
also
disappear
when
it
is
seen
with
what
beneficial
results
the
system
of
mixed
education
is
attended
and
one
great
advantage
to
be
expected
is
the
benefit
that
will
accrue
from
the
higher
reverence
for
science
that
must
necessarily
result
from
such
a
system
once
admit
the
impropriety
of
teaching
men
and
women
together
and
you
tax
science
with
impurity
and
while
such
a
feeling
is
entertained
and
it
surely
must
be
lurking
in
the
minds
of
those
who
oppose
mixed
classes
the
study
of
science
if
not
absolutely
injurious
must
be
robbed
of
great
part
of
its
power
to
elevate
the
mind
and
heart
science
has
had
to
fight
many
a
hard
battle
for
a
long
time
it
was
asserted
that
science
and
religion
were
antagonistic
to
each
other
but
a
faraday
has
shown
us
how
the
two
may
go
hand
in
hand
each
helping
and
supporting
the
other
last
april
we
were
told
that
the
study
of
science
was
linked
with
impurity
of
thought
and
we
look
upon
the
present
action
of
the
lecturers
of
hall
as
a
result
of
the
indignant
protest
which
every
man
of
science
must
have
longed
to
utter
against
such
a
wholly
false
and
calumnious
statement
it
is
as
the
champions
of
science
rather
than
of
medical
women
that
these
gentlemen
must
be
regarded
in
any
case
science
would
have
passed
through
this
last
attack
as
she
has
ever
done
through
all
similar
attacks
victorious
and
unscathed
and
unrestrained
in
her
power
to
bless
and
help
mankind
but
the
lecturers
of
our
city
have
the
no
small
honour
of
having
publicly
testified
their
unqualified
conviction
of
the
entire
purity
of
all
scientific
knowledge
and
research
now
that
the
lecturers
of
hall
have
come
forward
as
a
body
to
affirm
the
same
principle
we
may
indeed
hail
the
beginning
of
the
end
and
may
trust
soon
to
see
the
day
when
the
man
who
condemns
the
teaching
of
science
to
classes
of
both
men
and
women
will
simply
stand
as
wanting
alike
in
true
scientific
spirit
and
in
genuine
purity
of
july
seems
that
two
ladies
have
this
week
applied
for
admission
as
students
to
st
hospital
in
london
and
a
medical
contemporary
makes
this
fact
the
excuse
for
a
fresh
onslaught
on
all
women
who
may
for
the
sake
of
a
thorough
medical
education
wish
to
enter
the
existing
schools
which
at
present
possess
a
legal
monopoly
of
that
education
the
editorial
delicacy
declares
any
women
should
be
found
who
desire
such
fellowship
in
study
is
to
us
this
sneer
directed
against
ladies
as
medical
students
is
peculiarly
at
a
moment
when
the
medical
profession
are
loudly
calling
on
women
to
come
to
their
aid
in
the
military
hospitals
of
the
continent
teeming
as
we
know
them
to
be
with
horrors
which
certainly
far
surpass
any
that
ladies
are
likely
to
encounter
in
their
ordinary
course
of
study
and
which
must
inevitably
be
witnessed
in
company
persons
of
the
opposite
certainly
no
reasons
of
delicacy
at
least
can
justify
in
the
one
case
and
yet
demand
their
exclusion
in
the
other
truth
is
that
of
course
a
certain
conventional
standard
of
propriety
exists
which
it
is
well
and
desirable
to
maintain
under
ordinary
circumstances
as
between
persons
of
opposite
sexes
and
this
rule
forbids
the
casual
discussion
of
most
medical
and
some
scientific
subjects
in
chance
audiences
composed
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
but
a
higher
law
remains
behind
populi
suprema
if
perishing
humanity
cries
aloud
for
help
as
during
the
present
fearful
struggle
we
should
think
little
of
the
pretended
delicacy
which
could
hinder
either
men
or
women
from
flocking
to
the
rescue
and
bid
them
pause
the
name
of
modesty
to
consider
whether
under
these
circumstances
proprieties
would
always
be
observed
so
too
when
the
question
really
at
stake
is
whether
all
women
are
to
be
deprived
of
the
medical
services
of
their
own
sex
for
fear
some
should
be
shocked
by
the
idea
of
their
studying
in
the
ordinary
it
is
time
to
protest
that
true
science
being
of
necessity
impersonal
is
absolutely
pure
we
remember
that
when
an
attack
was
made
on
dr
alleyne
nicholson
a
month
or
two
ago
for
admitting
women
to
his
classes
he
replied
in
a
letter
to
one
of
the
medical
papers
that
he
laid
stress
on
the
purity
or
modesty
of
those
who
find
themselves
able
to
extract
food
for
improper
feelings
from
a
purely
scientific
subject
and
we
confess
that
we
are
inclined
to
share
his
opinion
which
we
suspect
will
be
that
of
all
the
noblest
and
most
enlightened
men
of
science
great
deal
of
nonsense
has
been
talked
with
reference
to
classes
and
as
it
is
probable
that
the
subject
may
come
up
again
in
a
practical
shape
before
long
it
is
as
well
to
say
a
few
plain
words
about
the
question
at
issue
first
of
all
let
it
be
clearly
established
that
medicine
can
not
be
taught
advantageously
nor
indeed
legally
in
holes
and
corners
to
or
even
a
dozen
students
in
the
very
paper
in
which
appeared
the
offensive
paragraph
to
which
we
have
alluded
we
find
a
plea
for
the
consolidation
of
the
london
medical
schools
into
a
smaller
number
because
are
not
students
to
support
them
all
in
perfection
and
because
two
or
three
lecturers
with
abundant
apparatus
could
teach
to
far
greater
advantage
than
twice
or
thrice
that
number
under
present
circumstances
if
this
is
true
where
there
are
at
least
several
hundred
students
to
be
divided
among
the
eleven
existing
schools
how
palpably
absurd
it
is
to
recommend
our
countrywomen
to
separate
places
of
medical
education
and
examination
when
the
whole
number
of
ladies
desiring
to
study
medicine
in
england
may
perhaps
number
a
score
our
own
university
professors
tell
us
plainly
that
separate
classes
for
ladies
are
an
impossibility
and
the
practical
experience
of
hall
pointing
in
the
same
direction
evidently
guided
its
lecturers
in
their
recent
vote
the
broad
fact
therefore
must
be
accepted
that
either
the
door
must
be
shut
in
the
face
of
all
women
and
that
at
a
moment
when
some
of
them
are
proving
to
a
demonstration
their
remarkable
fitness
to
enter
it
or
they
must
be
allowed
as
they
long
ago
requested
to
enter
quietly
and
without
remark
and
take
their
places
with
other
students
to
learn
the
common
lessons
equally
necessary
for
all
after
all
what
are
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
we
are
told
oracularly
that
what
is
proposed
is
bonos
and
are
warned
with
equal
solemnity
of
the
imminent
downfall
of
any
school
that
dares
to
break
loose
from
the
bondage
of
medical
and
afford
to
women
exactly
the
same
advantages
as
to
other
students
we
do
not
wish
to
speak
solely
or
even
chiefly
in
the
interests
of
women
we
wish
to
look
at
the
question
broadly
and
with
a
view
to
the
possible
moral
results
to
the
public
at
large
and
from
this
point
of
view
we
can
not
but
feel
that
the
more
general
association
of
the
sexes
in
earnest
labour
and
especially
in
scientific
and
medical
study
may
be
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
community
though
the
traditions
of
the
bob
sawyer
period
are
happily
passing
away
there
yet
seems
to
linger
an
idea
that
medical
students
as
a
rule
adopt
a
lower
moral
standard
and
are
of
a
more
generally
reckless
character
than
those
studying
for
other
professions
if
this
is
so
may
not
the
explanation
be
found
in
the
sort
of
idea
that
seems
prevalent
in
so
many
minds
that
there
is
in
medical
study
something
which
if
not
actually
improper
and
indelicate
certainly
tends
that
way
and
had
better
be
ignored
as
much
as
possible
something
at
least
which
the
average
public
would
probably
sum
up
as
we
believe
that
it
is
on
this
popular
idea
which
every
true
physician
would
indignantly
disclaim
that
the
opponents
of
education
trade
when
they
try
to
enlist
public
feeling
against
mixed
classes
they
talk
in
a
vague
and
very
offensive
way
about
certain
studies
which
form
a
necessary
part
of
medical
education
and
not
being
themselves
capable
of
seeing
the
true
dignity
and
profound
purity
of
all
science
especially
when
pursued
with
the
aim
of
succouring
pain
and
combating
disease
they
manage
too
often
to
impress
the
general
public
with
the
idea
that
by
sanctioning
the
joint
study
of
medicine
by
men
and
women
the
said
public
would
commit
itself
to
some
shocking
impropriety
all
the
more
awful
for
being
quite
indefinite
ignotum
pro
it
is
probable
that
this
sort
of
vague
terror
is
in
fact
the
best
weapon
yet
forged
against
women
students
but
like
many
another
terror
it
is
one
that
vanishes
in
the
clear
daylight
let
it
once
be
broadly
understood
that
science
has
no
hidden
horrors
that
the
study
of
works
can
never
be
otherwise
than
healthful
and
beautiful
to
every
student
who
brings
to
their
contemplation
a
clear
eye
and
a
clean
hand
and
this
weapon
of
darkness
will
be
shivered
for
ever
we
believe
indeed
that
nothing
could
be
more
desirable
for
the
average
young
medical
student
than
to
find
himself
associated
in
daily
study
with
women
whom
he
can
not
but
respect
nothing
more
calculated
to
give
him
an
earnest
sense
alike
of
the
dignity
and
of
the
purity
of
his
vocation
than
to
labour
in
it
side
by
side
with
ladies
whose
character
and
whose
motives
are
to
him
a
daily
reminder
that
he
and
they
alike
are
set
apart
both
as
the
votaries
of
science
and
the
ministers
of
suffering
october
note
h
the
following
extracts
will
show
the
position
and
opportunities
of
study
enjoyed
by
lady
probationers
and
nurses
at
london
hospitals
the
first
is
taken
from
a
letter
written
by
a
lady
who
was
herself
trained
as
a
surgical
nurse
in
a
hospital
she
writes
the
ordinary
course
of
the
work
i
went
round
the
wards
with
the
visiting
surgeons
and
at
the
same
time
as
the
students
and
in
fact
i
should
think
enjoyed
exactly
the
same
opportunities
that
people
profess
to
be
so
much
shocked
at
your
desiring
to
obtain
in
edinburgh
part
of
my
time
was
spent
in
study
in
the
female
and
part
in
the
male
wards
and
i
never
found
either
students
or
patients
see
anything
at
all
exceptional
in
my
presence
in
the
latter
though
i
often
had
to
perform
services
for
the
male
patients
which
would
never
be
expected
of
you
as
students
when
any
patients
from
my
wards
went
into
the
theatre
for
operation
i
as
a
matter
of
course
accompanied
them
and
was
present
during
the
operation
standing
often
quite
near
the
surgeon
however
many
students
might
be
there
at
the
time
i
was
therefore
constantly
associated
with
the
students
in
the
hospital
work
as
were
all
the
other
ladies
studying
in
the
same
capacity
and
i
never
saw
any
difficulty
in
this
arrangement
nor
had
any
reason
to
suppose
that
the
students
thinking
that
a
evidence
might
be
challenged
on
this
matter
i
wrote
to
one
of
the
principal
surgeons
of
the
middlesex
hospital
for
confirmation
of
her
statement
and
received
the
following
reply
and
lady
probationers
are
present
in
the
wards
and
attend
the
surgeons
in
their
visits
and
are
present
at
operations
the
students
never
so
far
as
i
observed
took
any
notice
of
the
question
as
to
whether
the
female
attendants
in
the
wards
were
ladies
or
ordinary
nurses
never
in
short
troubled
themselves
about
while
on
the
subject
i
will
quote
an
extract
from
a
letter
received
from
dr
elizabeth
blackwell
the
first
englishwoman
who
ever
received
a
medical
degree
she
says
walked
st
hospital
in
the
years
i
received
permission
to
do
so
from
the
governors
and
was
received
by
the
medical
faculty
with
a
friendly
courtesy
for
which
i
shall
always
be
grateful
i
always
went
round
with
the
class
of
students
during
the
visits
the
medical
class
numbered
about
thirty
students
i
spent
between
five
and
six
hours
daily
in
recording
and
studying
cases
during
the
visits
i
never
received
anything
but
courtesy
from
the
students
when
studying
in
the
wards
i
received
much
kind
assistance
from
the
clinical
clerks
and
dressers
while
leaving
the
hospital
the
treasurer
said
to
me
we
gave
you
permission
to
enter
we
thought
we
were
doing
something
so
unusual
that
we
were
rather
anxious
about
the
result
but
really
everything
has
gone
on
so
quietly
so
exactly
as
usual
that
we
had
almost
forgotten
you
were
my
observation
of
mixed
study
is
that
a
small
select
number
of
women
may
join
an
ordinary
school
with
little
difficulty
and
that
there
is
even
less
trouble
in
arranging
hospital
visiting
than
the
last
case
that
i
will
cite
with
reference
to
hospital
instruction
is
that
of
mrs
leggett
who
is
now
attending
as
a
regular
student
in
hospital
dublin
and
who
writes
had
the
unanimous
consent
of
the
board
to
pursue
my
medical
studies
in
hospital
as
to
the
medical
students
they
are
always
civil
dr
macnamara
president
of
the
college
of
physicians
of
ireland
said
it
was
his
opinion
that
the
presence
of
ladies
would
refine
the
with
reference
to
the
attendance
of
this
lady
dr
hamilton
medical
secretary
of
hospital
writes
far
as
we
have
gone
we
find
the
education
of
mixed
classes
in
one
hospital
to
work
very
note
i
the
following
are
a
few
only
out
of
very
many
expressions
of
public
indignation
at
this
episode
of
the
most
singular
of
university
comes
to
us
from
decorous
edinburgh
true
it
is
the
very
antithesis
of
cases
such
as
are
only
too
familiar
on
this
side
the
border
of
debauchery
at
night
and
a
scene
in
court
next
morning
but
it
is
not
a
whit
the
less
discreditable
the
transgressor
however
is
not
a
college
student
but
a
college
professor
the
case
admits
of
we
might
say
demands
historic
treatment
some
years
ago
dr
hope
then
professor
of
chemistry
in
the
university
gave
a
course
of
lectures
to
ladies
at
that
time
quite
an
experiment
and
was
so
much
gratified
we
are
told
at
their
popularity
that
he
devoted
the
proceeds
amounting
to
about
a
thousand
pounds
to
found
what
have
since
been
termed
hope
scholarships
we
now
get
to
a
very
modern
period
indeed
the
chemistry
class
during
last
winter
numbered
no
less
than
students
of
whom
six
were
ladies
who
had
been
admitted
to
study
in
the
medical
classes
accordance
with
the
decision
of
the
university
authorities
at
the
beginning
of
the
a
few
days
ago
the
results
of
the
examination
were
made
known
when
it
appeared
that
one
lady
miss
mary
edith
pechey
was
in
the
proud
position
of
third
in
the
list
of
honours
and
another
lady
miss
sophia
tenth
miss
success
is
the
more
gratifying
inasmuch
as
she
is
a
fresh
student
while
the
two
gentlemen
who
stood
above
her
on
the
list
have
attended
a
previous
course
of
lectures
dr
crum
brown
the
professor
of
chemistry
in
announcing
the
results
took
upon
himself
to
say
that
he
should
pass
over
miss
pechey
and
award
one
of
the
hope
scholarships
to
the
next
male
on
the
list
this
is
directly
in
the
teeth
of
the
regulations
made
and
provided
for
his
guidance
according
to
which
these
scholarships
are
to
be
awarded
to
four
students
whose
names
stand
highest
in
the
chemistry
class
for
the
we
understand
that
professor
crum
brown
justifies
his
action
on
the
ignoble
plea
the
women
now
studying
in
the
university
class
do
not
form
part
of
the
university
class
on
account
of
their
meeting
at
a
different
great
indignation
has
very
naturally
been
excited
in
edinburgh
by
this
incident
and
the
question
has
been
referred
to
the
senate
of
the
university
who
though
a
corporate
body
will
we
hope
act
as
honourable
examiner
and
april
inferior
sex
has
always
been
a
nuisance
and
a
bore
a
wise
old
sultan
of
turkey
used
to
ask
whenever
anything
went
wrong
was
she
one
day
while
the
sultan
was
making
an
addition
to
his
palace
as
is
the
habit
of
sultans
a
labourer
fell
from
the
scaffold
and
was
killed
was
she
said
the
sultan
at
once
the
inferior
sex
is
always
plaguing
the
superior
sex
in
one
way
or
another
and
now
it
seems
that
the
inferior
sex
are
winning
scholarships
over
our
most
sacred
heads
this
is
a
matter
which
must
be
looked
to
we
will
stand
a
great
deal
but
this
is
going
a
little
too
far
we
must
agitate
members
must
pledge
themselves
on
the
hustings
to
a
bill
providing
that
any
one
of
the
inferior
sex
who
gains
a
scholarship
must
not
have
it
at
any
price
whatever
or
we
shall
all
be
undone
we
must
have
an
act
for
the
repression
of
women
we
are
very
sorry
to
say
such
terrible
words
but
the
thing
must
be
done
it
had
better
be
done
at
once
while
the
nation
is
in
a
mood
for
repression
particular
cases
thrust
themselves
prominently
on
the
national
mind
and
cause
legislation
the
coercion
bill
for
ireland
was
thrust
on
to
an
unwilling
government
by
a
very
few
of
the
later
agrarian
outrages
the
last
ounce
breaks
the
back
if
miss
edith
pechey
chooses
to
come
in
at
the
head
of
the
chemistry
class
of
her
year
we
of
the
superior
sex
must
really
look
to
ourselves
we
have
the
power
of
legislation
still
left
in
our
hands
and
we
warn
such
ladies
as
miss
edith
pechey
and
miss
that
we
shall
use
it
we
must
have
a
bill
for
the
protection
of
the
superior
sex
feel
sure
that
the
ladies
will
forgive
joking
about
a
very
absurd
matter
ladies
should
surely
understand
the
power
of
ridicule
we
think
that
the
ad
in
this
matter
is
the
proper
line
of
argument
the
facts
of
the
case
seem
to
be
simply
these
after
protracted
delays
and
much
discussion
the
university
authorities
last
autumn
vouchsafed
to
ladies
the
permission
to
enter
the
college
as
matriculated
medical
students
with
the
single
restriction
that
their
instruction
should
be
conducted
in
separate
classes
on
referring
to
the
minutes
of
the
university
court
we
find
the
following
definition
of
the
position
to
be
taken
by
the
new
students
women
attending
such
classes
shall
be
subject
to
all
the
regulations
now
or
at
any
future
time
in
force
in
the
university
as
to
the
matriculation
of
students
their
attendance
on
classes
examination
or
we
turn
to
the
calendar
to
see
what
are
the
in
force
in
the
as
to
examination
in
chemistry
and
we
find
at
page
the
following
class
honours
are
determined
by
means
of
written
examinations
held
during
the
session
the
four
students
who
have
received
the
highest
marks
entitled
to
have
the
hope
to
the
laboratory
of
the
the
ladies
accepted
in
good
faith
the
regulations
of
the
university
and
fired
by
a
laudable
ambition
to
prove
themselves
worthy
of
the
privileges
now
accorded
for
the
first
time
to
women
worked
with
an
assiduity
that
may
be
guessed
when
it
is
found
that
one
of
them
miss
pechey
actually
gained
the
highest
number
of
marks
awarded
during
the
session
to
any
student
attending
chemistry
for
the
first
time
though
she
was
excelled
by
one
and
two
marks
respectively
by
two
gentlemen
who
had
gone
through
a
previous
course
of
lectures
but
when
the
day
arrived
which
was
to
reward
all
this
work
the
professor
announced
without
as
it
seemed
to
us
a
shadow
of
justification
that
the
four
scholarships
would
be
given
according
to
the
university
regulations
to
the
four
students
to
but
to
the
three
gentlemen
who
had
won
the
first
second
and
fourth
places
and
to
the
one
who
stood
fifth
on
the
list
this
last
having
earned
a
most
honourable
place
by
his
talents
and
industry
but
the
hope
scholarship
though
now
he
has
of
course
the
right
to
claim
free
admission
to
the
laboratory
as
it
has
been
promised
to
him
this
then
is
a
university
episode
six
students
are
admitted
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
with
one
exception
dictated
as
we
think
by
a
whimsical
propriety
they
are
to
be
to
the
regulations
of
the
university
no
hint
is
given
to
them
that
this
statement
is
analogous
to
the
one
which
pithily
describes
political
condition
in
england
means
when
a
question
of
hanging
mean
when
a
question
of
the
ladies
are
encouraged
to
exert
their
utmost
power
for
work
when
the
rewards
are
to
come
and
it
is
found
that
one
of
them
has
earned
one
of
the
highest
honours
attainable
by
the
class
she
is
calmly
informed
that
that
honour
has
been
given
to
somebody
else
a
neater
instance
of
generosity
with
other
property
it
has
never
been
our
lot
to
witness
and
we
care
how
long
it
is
before
we
repeat
the
experience
only
excuse
that
we
can
with
the
utmost
stretch
of
charity
imagine
in
this
case
would
be
that
dr
crum
brown
thought
some
difficulty
might
arise
respecting
miss
use
of
the
scholarship
which
gives
free
admittance
to
the
laboratory
under
the
restrictions
now
imposed
on
women
by
the
university
court
for
we
will
not
suppose
for
a
moment
that
the
professor
could
himself
wish
to
impede
the
further
progress
of
a
student
of
such
merit
but
if
such
difficulty
occurred
it
might
be
an
excellent
reason
for
relaxing
those
restrictions
when
they
are
seen
to
deprive
a
student
of
the
full
reward
of
her
past
work
and
at
the
same
time
to
prevent
her
prosecuting
further
the
study
in
which
she
has
so
distinguished
herself
but
we
are
quite
at
a
loss
to
see
how
any
legitimate
argument
can
be
drawn
thence
to
justify
dr
brown
in
laying
violent
hands
on
a
scholarship
which
has
been
fairly
earned
by
one
person
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
it
to
another
it
is
possible
that
circumstances
may
prevent
his
deriving
full
benefit
from
some
of
his
possessions
but
the
law
would
hardly
consider
this
fact
a
valid
reason
for
the
said
possession
for
the
benefit
of
if
dr
brown
chooses
to
admit
a
fifth
student
to
the
laboratory
he
can
of
course
do
so
but
unless
we
are
greatly
mistaken
he
will
probably
be
informed
by
the
law
faculty
whom
he
might
previously
have
consulted
with
advantage
that
neither
he
nor
any
other
person
can
alter
the
fact
that
miss
pechey
and
no
one
else
third
hope
april
very
odd
and
very
gross
injustice
appears
to
have
been
attempted
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
in
that
university
the
lady
medical
students
are
taught
in
a
separate
class
not
from
any
wish
of
their
own
but
through
the
delicacy
of
the
professors
in
the
chemical
class
miss
edith
pechey
gained
the
third
place
and
was
first
of
the
first
students
the
two
men
who
surpassed
her
having
attended
the
class
before
the
four
students
who
get
the
highest
marks
receive
four
hope
scholarships
scholarships
founded
by
dr
hope
some
years
ago
out
of
the
proceeds
of
a
very
popular
of
chemistry
with
the
success
of
which
he
had
been
much
gratified
yet
miss
edith
pechey
was
held
by
the
professor
not
to
be
entitled
to
the
third
scholarship
and
omitting
her
name
he
included
two
men
whom
she
had
beaten
and
who
stood
fourth
and
fifth
in
the
examination
his
excuse
being
that
the
women
are
not
part
of
the
university
class
because
they
are
separately
taught
yet
dr
crum
brown
awards
miss
pechey
a
bronze
medal
to
which
only
members
of
the
university
class
are
said
to
be
entitled
it
is
quite
clear
that
such
a
decision
can
not
stand
to
make
women
attend
a
separate
class
for
which
they
have
to
pay
we
believe
much
higher
fees
than
usual
and
then
argue
that
they
are
out
of
the
pale
of
competition
because
they
do
so
is
indeed
too
like
the
captious
schoolmaster
who
first
sent
a
boy
into
the
corner
and
then
whipped
him
for
not
being
in
his
april
letter
miss
pechey
addressed
to
us
the
other
day
was
written
in
an
admirable
spirit
and
must
insure
her
the
hearty
sympathy
of
all
whatever
their
opinions
upon
the
points
in
question
she
has
done
her
sex
a
service
not
only
by
vindicating
their
intellectual
ability
in
an
open
competition
with
men
but
still
more
by
the
temper
and
courtesy
with
which
she
meets
her
disappointments
under
any
view
of
the
main
question
her
case
is
a
hard
one
for
it
is
clear
both
she
and
the
other
lady
students
were
led
to
attend
the
classes
under
the
misapprehension
of
the
privileges
to
which
they
were
admissable
if
the
university
intended
to
exclude
ladies
from
the
pecuniary
advantages
usually
attached
to
successful
study
the
intention
should
have
been
clearly
announced
miss
pechey
in
the
spirit
of
a
true
student
says
she
is
abundantly
repaid
for
her
exertions
by
the
knowledge
she
has
acquired
but
it
is
none
the
less
hard
that
having
been
encouraged
to
labour
for
a
coveted
reward
and
having
fairly
won
it
she
should
be
disqualified
by
a
restriction
of
which
no
warning
had
been
given
april
are
probably
few
persons
who
did
not
learn
with
regret
the
decision
of
the
edinburgh
senatus
in
respect
of
the
hope
scholarships
it
is
not
pleasant
that
such
a
story
of
at
least
seeming
injustice
should
circulate
through
foreign
universities
to
the
discredit
of
our
own
for
there
can
not
be
much
doubt
as
to
the
view
that
will
be
taken
of
the
case
by
those
nations
now
forming
the
majority
in
europe
who
have
admitted
women
to
their
medical
colleges
on
terms
of
exact
fairness
and
equality
with
their
other
students
a
medical
contemporary
argues
that
this
affair
proves
how
unwise
it
was
to
admit
women
to
the
university
of
edinburgh
such
admission
being
as
is
asserted
the
natural
source
of
but
most
unprejudiced
people
judging
the
case
at
first
sight
would
surely
rather
see
here
the
evil
of
a
partial
restricted
and
permissive
legislation
if
women
have
a
claim
to
medical
education
at
all
they
have
exactly
the
same
claim
as
men
if
they
are
to
be
received
as
students
at
all
they
must
certainly
be
treated
with
justice
and
not
as
social
or
rather
academical
to
whom
the
bare
crumbs
of
instruction
are
vouchsafed
as
a
grace
and
bounty
while
all
the
honours
and
rewards
are
to
be
reserved
to
their
male
competitors
looking
at
the
thing
for
a
moment
merely
in
the
interests
of
the
young
men
and
as
a
question
of
expediency
we
can
not
imagine
anything
much
worse
for
their
moral
guidance
than
to
find
that
women
are
indeed
to
compete
with
them
but
so
shackled
that
they
can
never
win
or
rather
that
if
they
do
win
the
prizes
will
be
snatched
from
their
grasp
and
given
to
men
whom
they
have
beaten
we
have
heard
that
in
both
classes
where
the
ladies
have
this
year
studied
a
very
unusual
access
of
zeal
and
energy
has
been
noticed
among
the
gentlemen
in
the
other
section
of
the
class
a
happy
effect
of
such
competition
which
has
often
been
observed
in
the
mixed
colleges
of
america
and
which
surely
need
not
be
neutralised
here
by
the
providence
of
the
april
senatus
has
by
a
small
majority
confirmed
professor
crum
decision
with
regard
to
miss
pechey
and
the
hope
scholarship
on
the
grounds
previously
presumed
by
us
but
these
grounds
if
so
they
may
be
called
are
in
our
opinion
insufficient
to
deprive
miss
pechey
of
the
scholarship
whatever
may
be
our
views
regarding
the
advisability
of
ladies
studying
medicine
the
university
of
edinburgh
professed
to
open
its
gates
to
them
on
equal
terms
with
the
other
students
and
unless
some
better
excuse
be
forthcoming
in
explanation
of
the
decision
of
the
senatus
we
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
university
has
done
no
less
an
injustice
to
itself
than
to
one
of
its
most
distinguished
medical
april
note
j
for
the
credit
of
the
profession
i
append
also
the
following
indignant
protest
from
the
chief
medical
paper
are
very
varying
opinions
abroad
in
the
medical
profession
and
among
the
public
as
to
the
advisability
of
allowing
women
to
practise
medicine
there
are
still
more
serious
and
doubts
as
to
the
possibility
of
educating
ladies
in
the
same
lecture
rooms
and
dissecting
rooms
with
male
students
but
until
last
week
we
were
not
aware
that
any
one
in
the
profession
or
out
of
it
held
that
the
mere
fact
of
ladies
wishing
to
be
educated
in
common
with
men
in
order
that
they
might
make
sure
of
receiving
the
highest
and
most
thorough
scientific
training
justified
those
who
held
contrary
opinions
in
loading
them
with
abuse
and
vulgar
insult
it
has
been
reserved
for
dr
laycock
professor
in
the
famous
university
of
edinburgh
to
set
an
example
which
we
trust
even
the
least
courteous
and
gentlemanly
of
students
will
hesitate
to
follow
we
shall
only
remark
that
if
the
coarsest
of
those
few
students
who
still
keep
alive
the
bad
traditions
of
the
bob
sawyer
period
had
given
utterance
to
the
insinuations
which
were
used
by
this
distinguished
professor
we
should
simply
have
shrugged
our
shoulders
and
concluded
that
the
delinquent
would
be
at
once
expelled
with
ignominy
from
his
school
unfortunately
there
are
no
such
punishments
for
men
like
dr
laycock
but
at
the
least
we
can
express
the
deep
indignation
and
disgust
which
we
are
certain
every
gentleman
in
the
profession
must
feel
at
the
outrage
of
which
he
has
been
april
note
k
the
following
are
the
papers
referred
to
in
the
text
from
the
lady
lord
and
gentlemen
we
the
undersigned
registered
students
of
medicine
beg
to
lay
before
you
the
following
facts
and
to
request
your
kind
attention
to
them
applying
in
the
usual
course
for
tickets
of
admission
to
attend
the
practice
of
the
royal
infirmary
we
were
informed
by
the
clerk
that
the
managers
were
not
prepared
to
issue
tickets
to
medical
students
we
earnestly
request
you
to
reconsider
this
decision
on
the
following
grounds
that
the
authorities
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
and
of
the
school
of
the
college
of
physicians
and
surgeons
have
admitted
our
right
to
study
medicine
with
a
view
to
graduation
that
an
important
and
indispensable
part
of
medical
education
consists
in
attending
the
practice
of
a
medical
and
surgical
hospital
and
that
the
regulations
of
the
licensing
boards
require
as
part
of
the
curriculum
of
study
two
attendance
at
a
hospital
which
accommodates
not
fewer
than
eighty
patients
and
possesses
a
distinct
staff
of
physicians
and
that
the
only
hospital
in
edinburgh
possessing
the
required
qualifications
is
the
royal
infirmary
and
that
exclusion
from
that
institution
would
therefore
preclude
the
possibility
of
our
continuing
our
course
of
medical
study
in
this
city
that
in
the
present
state
of
divided
opinion
on
the
subject
it
is
possible
that
such
a
consummation
may
give
satisfaction
to
some
but
we
can
not
suppose
that
your
honourable
board
would
wish
to
put
yourselves
in
the
attitude
of
rendering
null
and
void
the
decisions
of
the
authorities
of
the
university
of
which
we
are
matriculated
students
and
of
the
school
of
the
college
of
physicians
and
surgeons
where
we
are
now
attending
the
classes
of
anatomy
and
surgery
that
it
has
been
the
invariable
custom
of
the
managers
to
grant
tickets
of
admission
to
students
of
the
university
and
of
hall
and
that
as
far
as
we
are
aware
no
statute
of
the
infirmary
limits
such
admission
to
students
of
one
sex
only
that
the
advertised
terms
on
which
the
wards
of
the
infirmary
are
open
to
all
registered
and
matriculated
students
were
such
as
to
leave
no
doubt
on
our
minds
that
we
should
be
admitted
if
therefore
our
exclusion
should
be
finally
determined
we
shall
suffer
great
pecuniary
loss
and
damage
by
this
departure
of
the
managers
from
their
advertised
regulations
that
if
we
are
granted
admission
to
the
infirmary
by
your
honourable
board
there
are
physicians
and
surgeons
on
the
hospital
staff
who
will
gladly
afford
us
the
necessary
clinical
instruction
and
find
no
difficulty
in
doing
so
in
support
of
the
above
assertion
we
beg
to
enclose
the
accompanying
papers
marked
and
b
that
we
are
of
systematic
and
theoretical
surgery
with
the
rest
of
dr
class
in
hall
and
are
therefore
unable
to
see
what
legitimate
objection
can
be
raised
to
our
also
attending
with
them
his
hospital
visit
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
patients
in
the
infirmary
being
women
and
women
being
present
in
all
the
wards
as
nurses
there
can
be
nothing
exceptional
in
our
presence
there
as
students
that
in
our
opinion
no
objection
can
be
raised
to
our
attending
clinical
teaching
even
in
the
male
wards
which
does
not
apply
with
at
least
equal
force
to
the
present
instruction
of
male
students
in
the
female
wards
that
we
are
unable
to
believe
it
to
be
in
consonance
with
the
wishes
of
the
majority
of
the
subscribers
and
donors
to
the
infirmary
among
whom
are
perhaps
as
many
women
as
men
that
its
educational
advantages
should
be
restricted
to
students
of
one
sex
only
when
students
of
the
other
sex
also
form
part
of
the
regular
medical
classes
beg
respectfully
to
submit
the
above
considerations
to
the
notice
of
your
honourable
board
and
trust
that
you
will
reconsider
your
recent
decision
which
threatens
to
do
us
so
great
an
injury

that

will

our

allow

attend

of
our

and
to
express
our
opinion

lord
and

as
lecturers
in
the

medical
school
we
beg
most
respectfully
to
approach
your
honourable
board
on
behalf
of
the
eight
female
students
of
this
school
whom
we
understand
you
object
to
admit
to
the
practice
of
the
royal
infirmary
on
their
behalf
we
beg
to
state
that
they
are
regularly
registered
students
of
medicine
in
this
school
that
they
are
at
present
attending
along
with
the
other
students
our
courses
of
anatomy
practical
anatomy
demonstrations
of
anatomy
and
systematic
surgery
in
the
school
at
hall
that
as
teachers
of
anatomy
and
surgery
respectively
we
find
no
difficulty
in
conducting
our
courses
to
such
mixed
classes
composed
of
male
and
female
students
sitting
together
on
the
same
benches
and
that
the
presence
of
those
eight
female
students
has
not
led
us
to
alter
or
modify
our
course
of
instruction
in
any
way
that
the
presence
of
the
female
students
so
far
from
diminishing
the
numbers
entering
our
classes
we
find
both
the
attendance
and
the
actual
numbers
already
enrolled
are
larger
than
in
previous
sessions
that
in
our
experience
in
these
mixed
classes
the
demeanour
of
the
students
is
more
orderly
and
quiet
and
their
application
to
study
more
diligent
and
earnest
than
during
former
sessions
when
male
students
alone
were
present
that
in
our
opinion
if
practical
bedside
instruction
in
the
examination
and
treatment
of
cases
is
withheld
from
the
female
pupils
by
the
refusal
to
them
of
access
as
medical
students
to
the
practice
of
the
infirmary
we
must
regard
the
value
of
any
systematic
surgical
course
thus
rendered
devoid
of
daily
practical
illustration
as
infinitely
less
than
the
same
course
attended
by
male
pupils
who
have
the
additional
advantage
of
the
hospital
instruction
under
the
same
teacher
that
the
surgical
instruction
being
deprived
of
its
practical
aspect
by
the
exclusion
of
the
female
pupils
from
the
infirmary
and
therefore
from
the
wards
of
their
systematic
surgical
teacher
the
knowledge
of
these
female
students
may
very
reasonably
be
expected
to
suffer
not
only
in
examinations
but
in
their
capacity
to
practise
their
profession
in
after
life
that
our
experience
of
mixed
classes
leads
us
to
the
conviction
that
the
attendance
of
the
female
students
at
the
ordinary
hospital
visit
along
with
the
male
students
can
not
certainly
be
more
objectionable
to
the
male
students
and
the
male
patients
than
the
presence
of
the
ward
nurses
or
to
the
female
patients
than
the
presence
of
the
male
students
that
the
class
of
society
to
which
these
eight
female
students
belong
together
with
the
reserve
of
manner
and
the
serious
and
reverent
spirit
in
which
they
devote
themselves
to
the
study
of
medicine
make
it
impossible
that
any
impropriety
could
arise
out
of
their
attendance
upon
the
wards
as
regards
either
patients
or
male
pupils
conclusion
we
trust
that
your
honourable
board
may
see
fit
on
considering
these
statements
to
resolve
not
to
exclude
these
female
students
from
the
practice
of
at
all
events
those
physicians
and
surgeons
who
do
not
object
to
their
presence
at
the
ordinary
visit
along
with
the
other
students
an
absolute
exclusion
of
female
pupils
from
the
wards
of
the
royal
infirmary
as
such
a
decision
of
your
honourable
board
would
determine
we
could
not
but
regard
as
an
act
of
practical
injustice
to
pupils
who
having
been
admitted
to
the
study
of
the
medical
profession
must
have
their
further
progress
in
their
studies

the
following
letter
is
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
indignation
felt
by
the
more
manly
students
at
the
events
referred
to
november
as
a
certain
class
of
medical
students
are
doing
their
utmost
to
make
the
name
of
medical
student
synonymous
with
all
that
is
cowardly
and
degrading
it
is
imperative
upon
all
those
who
wish
to
be
regarded
as
men
either
individually
or
collectively
to
come
forward
and
express
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
their
detestation
of
the
proceedings
which
have
characterised
and
dishonoured
the
opposition
to
ladies
pursuing
the
study
of
medicine
in
edinburgh
in
the
name
then
of
all
that
is
courteous
and
manly
i
as
a
student
of
medicine
most
indignantly
protest
against
such
scenes
as
were
enacted
at
the
college
of
surgeons
on
the
evenings
of
thursday
and
friday
last
and
indeed
on
several
occasions
during
the
week
would
it
were
possible
to
point
out
to
public
execration
the
movers
and
actors
in
such
scenes
but
it
is
difficult
to
decide
where
the
responsibility
begins
only
the
youths
to
be
blamed
who
hustle
and
hoot
at
ladies
in
the
public
streets
and
by
physical
force
close
the
college
gates
before
them
or
are
we
to
trace
their
outrageous
conduct
to
the
influence
of
the
class
room
where
their
respected
professor
meanly
takes
advantage
of
his
position
as
their
teacher
to
elicit
their
mirth
and
applause
to
arouse
their
jealousy
and
opposition
by
directing
unmanly
inuendoes
at
the
lady
students
if
such
conduct
be
permissible
on
the
part
of
the
professors
alas
for
the
school
whose
teachers
have
not
even
but
one
halfpennyworth
of
manliness
to
their
intolerable
deal
of
nastiness
or
boasted
philanthropy
as
the
case
may
be
and
whose
students
crowd
the
academic
precincts
to
hustle
hoot
at
cover
with
mud
and
even
to
strike
at
ladies
who
have
always
shown
themselves
to
be
gentle
and
noble
women
current
report
is
that
these
disgraceful
outrages
were
originally
and
principally
carried
out
by
students
of
the
college
of
surgeons
this
is
contrary
to
fact
certainly
the
majority
of
them
conducted
themselves
in
a
most
contemptible
manner
roused
not
by
a
word
or
look
from
the
ladies
but
by
the
possibility
of
being
outstripped
by
them
in
the
race
for
honours
and
therefore
did
they
elect
to
end
the
rivalry
by
an
appeal
to
brute
force
the
truth
however
is
that
the
rioters
were
called
together
by
a
missive
circulated
by
the
students
in
the
class
of
the
on
friday
morning
on
the
back
of
which
was
written
be
opened
by
those
who
signed
the
petition
to
the
managers
against
the
admission
of
female
this
missive
called
upon
the
petitioners
to
assemble
at
the
college
of
surgeons
before
four
for
the
purposes
which
they
so
thoroughly
carried
out
the
proceedings
of
friday
will
therefore
enable
the
public
now
to
judge
of
the
value
which
the
majority
of
the
managers
of
the
infirmary
ought
to
have
attached
to
the
prayers
of
petitioners
moreover
the
professor
who
is
to
receive
the
complimentary
address
which
is
being
got
up
by
the
same
memorialists
for
his
exertions
in
their
cause
must
feel
highly
flattered
by
the
implied
association
now
is
to
be
done
with
this
vexed
question
of
female
education
will
it
be
settled
by
continuing
those
brutal
exhibitions
or
by
asking
the
ladies
to
withdraw
neither
course
is
likely
to
prove
successful
another
and
a
more
honourable
course
has
been
suggested
by
some
of
the
original
memorialists
who
considering
their
honour
dearer
to
them
than
their
sympathies
declare
that
the
blot
can
only
be
wiped
away
by
their
joining
to
aid
the
ladies
who
have
been
so
thwarted
and
so
abused
in
obtaining
the
object
for
which
they
have
wrought
so
hard
and
endured
so
i
am
november
note
n
the
following
is
the
petition
referred
to
the
honourable
the
managers
of
the
royal
lord
and
gentlemen
we
the
undersigned
students
of
medicine
moved
solely
by
feelings
of
honour
and
justice
desire
to
approach
your
honourable
board
on
behalf
of
our
female
whom
we
understand
you
object
to
admit
to
the
practice
of
the
infirmary
under
any
circumstances
whatever
do
not
pretend
to
offer
any
opinion
on
the
question
of
mixed
classes
or
on
the
medical
education
of
women
but
we
consider
that
as
the
university
of
edinburgh
has
admitted
those
ladies
as
students
of
medicine
and
as
they
have
now
been
engaged
for
some
time
in
striving
honourably
and
successfully
to
gain
a
knowledge
of
our
profession
it
is
great
injustice
to
attempt
to
bar
their
further
progress
by
refusing
them
permission
to
attend
the
practice
of
the
infirmary
also
have
certain
pretensions
to
feelings
of
decency
and
morality
but
we
are
not
aware
that
the
lady
students
have
either
attempted
or
succeeded
in
outraging
them
on
the
contrary
our
feelings
have
been
outraged
by
the
unthinking
and
misguided
of
those
of
our
own
class
who
oppose
them
for
their
disgraceful
actions
we
would
seek
to
atone
by
asking
your
honourable
board
to
make
some
arrangement
by
which
the
ladies
may
be
admitted
to
the
practice
of
the
wards
a
matter
of
compromise
we
would
respectfully
request
that
the
ladies
be
admitted
to
the
wards
of
the
three
medical
gentlemen
who
are
willing
to
receive
them
on
our
part
we
beg
leave
to
express
our
perfect
willingness
to
attend
with
them
in
considering
the
most
serious
and
delicate
cases
in
the
wards
feel
proud
to
assert
our
ability
to
study
those
cases
from
scientific
and
philanthropic
points
of
view
with
those
feelings
of
delicacy
and
kindness
which
ought
to
actuate
every
medical
man
who
has
female
patients

his

from

quarters
which
has
met
every
effort
made
by
ladies
to
obtain

it
was
resolved
in

that
a
committee
should
be
formed
comprising
all
those
who
felt
the
injustice
of
the
present
arbitrary
exclusion
of
women
from
the
medical
profession
and
who
desired
to
in
the
following
objects
to
arrive
at
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
real
difficulties
of
the
case
distinguishing
clearly
between
those
hindrances
which
are
interposed
by
prejudice

and
the
real
obstacles

any
which
are

for
all
ladies

these
primary
objects
the
circumstances
of
the
case
have
subsequently
led
the
committee
to
add
the
following
to
make
such
temporary
arrangements
as
may
be
required
to
provide
the
ladies
with
qualifying

in

as

it
is
stated
in
history
of
that
the
first
mention
of
erecting
a
college
in
edinburgh
was
found
in
the
will
of
robert
reid
bishop
of
orkney
who
dying
in
bequeathed
eight
thousand
scottish
merks
towards
founding
a
college
the
education
of
the
subsequent
benefactions
and
charters
granted
by
queen
mary
in
and
by
king
james
in
no
stipulation
is
made
as
to
the
sex
of
the
students
for
whose
benefit
the
college
was
to
be
established
and
in
proclamation
was
made
inviting
who
were
inclined
to
become
scholars
to
enter
their
names
in
a
certain
book
opened
for
the
purpose
older
university
of
glasgow
was
founded
under
a
bull
granted
by
pope
nicholas
at
the
suit
of
james
ii
of
scotland
and
in
this
bull
it
was
expressly
stated
that
the
university
of
bologna
was
to
be
followed
as
a
model
and
that
the
doctors
masters
and
students
of
glasgow
were
to
enjoy
all
the
privileges
and
rights
possessed
by
those
of
bologna
there
is
abundant
historic
evidence
that
women
were
never
excluded
from
the
university
of
bologna
but
frequently
studied
and
took
degrees
there
during
the
middle
ages
and
that
no
less
than
seven
women
at
different
times
filled
professorial
chairs
in
this
university
three
of
them
being
in
the
medical
faculty
viz
bucca
professor
of
medicine
early
in
the
fifteenth
century
anna
morandi
mazzolini
professor
of
anatomy
maria
della
donne
professor
of
midwifery
appears
that
the
university
of
edinburgh
was
founded
generally
on
the
same
model
and
the
university
calendar
states
that
an
act
was
passed
by
the
scotch
parliament
which
ratified
to
the
university
in
ample
form
all
the
rights
immunities
and
privileges
enjoyed
by
other
universities

the
does
not
appear
in
any
of
the
statutes
or

subsequently
issued
any
regulation
that
male
students
alone
should
attend
the
university
nor
in
the
recent
act
of
is
there
any
such
regulation
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
applications
for
admission
to
the
university
of

seem
to
have
been
made
by

arrangements
of
the
university
after
due
communication
with
the
senatus
academicus
and
with
the
sanction
of
the
chancellor
provided
that
all
such
proposed
improvements
shall
be
submitted
to
the

made
for
additional
teaching
by

of

to
be
established
and
several
assistants
were
accordingly
appointed
by
the
commissioners
under
the
act
and
subsequently
the
senatus
appointed
certain
other
assistants
and
made
them
allowances
out
of
the
university
revenues
none
of
these
assistants
have
however
hitherto
delivered
courses
of
lectures
qualifying
for
graduation
though
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
clause
in
the
act
which
forbids
their
doing
so
the
only

the
following
queries
were
not
all
asked
in
the
first
instance
but
in
part
on
a
subsequent
occasion
see
as
however
they
were
all
submitted
on
the
same
case
and
concern
the
same
subject
i
give
them
here
consecutively
arranged
in
the
order
in
which
the
opinions
obtained
thereon
were
presented
to
the
senatus
or
university
court
in
the
permission
given
to
women
to
study
the
profession
of
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
bearing
date
november
was
it
involved
in
clauses
and
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
pass
the
ordinary
professional
examinations
and
to
proceed
to
the
degree
of
in
the
university
subject
only
to
the
restrictions
laid
down
in
the
said
regulations
and
is
it
therefore
incumbent
on
the
medical
faculty
to
admit
them
to
the
necessary
examinations
to
the
extent
of
the
subjects
in
which
they
are
already
qualified
to
pass
reading
the
regulations
referred
to
in
connection
with
the
resolutions
of
the
medical
faculty
which
were
approved
of
by
the
senatus
the
university
court
and
the
general
council
we
think
that
their
import
and
meaning
is
that
subject
to
the
restrictions
laid
down
in
the
regulations
women
shall
be
allowed
not
merely
to
qualify
themselves
for
the
ordinary
professional
examinations
with
a
view
to
obtain
a
medical
degree
in
the
university
but
also
when
so
qualified
to
be
admitted
to
these
examinations
we
are
therefore
of
opinion
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
medical
faculty
to
admit
them
to
examination
accordingly
if
this
was
not
involved
is
it
in
the
power
of
the
senatus
either
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
the
university
court
to
accord
the
required
permission
to
admit
them
to
professional
examination
with
a
view
to
graduation
upon
the
ground
of
keeping
faith
with
the
women
who
have
in
reliance
upon
the
regulations
and
in
compliance
with
the
terms
thereby
prescribed
qualified
themselves
for
professional
examination
with
a
view
to
graduation
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
senatus
is
entitled
to
direct
that
they
shall
be
admitted
to
examination
and
we
also
think
that
without
any
further
direction
or
authority
than
the
regulations
necessarily
imply
the
medical
faculty
is
entitled
to
admit
them
to
examination
and
is
it
competent
for
the
senatus
either
directly
or
in
conjunction
with
the
other
university
authorities
to
appoint
special
lecturers
to
deliver
qualifying
courses
of
lectures
to
women
who
are
matriculated
and
registered
students
of
medicine
when
such
instruction
can
not
be
obtained
from
the
professors
of
the
special
subjects
in
question
is
it
competent
for
the
senatus
or
other
university
authorities
so
far
to
relax
the
ordinary
regulations
with
respect
to
classes
as
to
authorise
women
to
attend
outside
the
university
those
courses
of
lectures
which
are
denied
to
them
by
the
professors
within
the
walls
such
courses
being
held
to
qualify
for
graduation
beyond
the
number
of
as
contemplated
in
the
present
regulations
if
the
existing
regulations
with
respect
to
graduation
in
medicine
stand
upon
statutes
passed
by
the
university
commissioners
whose
powers
have
now
expired
it
is
competent
for
the
university
court
to
alter
them
with
the
written
consent
of
the
chancellor
and
with
the
approval
of
her
majesty
in
council
this
is
provided
by
section
of
the
act
of
if
they
stand
on
the
authority
of
the
court
or
of
any
other
power
in
the
university
itself
we
should
think
that
they
may
be
altered
by
the
university
court
under
section
of
the
act
due
communication
with
the
senatus
academicus
and
with
the
sanction
of
the
chancellor
but
with
the
proviso
that
the
proposed
alteration
be
submitted
to
the
university
council
for
their
in
one
or
other
of
these
ways
it
appears
to
us
that
any
provision
which
may
be
deemed
necessary
or
proper
and
reasonable
for
enabling
women
to
complete
their
medical
studies
with
a
view
to
graduation
maybe
whether
the
senatus
university
court
university
council
and
chancellor
had
collectively
the
power
of
granting
to
women
the
permission
to
matriculate
as
students
as
they
did
in
and
whether
the
regulations
issued
officially
november
are
valid
as
regards
such
matriculation
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
university
court
in
virtue
of
the
powers
conferred
upon
it
by
the
section
of
the
act
have
power
after
communication
with
the
senatus
and
with
the
sanction
of
the
chancellor
and
after
the
university
council
have
considered
the
subject
to
grant
permission
to
women
as
they
did
in
to
matriculate
as
students
and
the
resolutions
of
the
court
in
that
year
are
valid
whether
the
medical
professors
are
exonerated
from
obligation
to
teach
in
some
way
or
other
all
matriculated
students
by
the
fact
that
in
clause
of
the
regulations
quoted
above
it
is
merely
stated
that
they
be
permitted
to
have
separate
classes
for
women
the
university
court
having
statutory
powers
to
improvements
in
the
arrangements
of
the
university
and
it
being
within
their
power
under
this
enactment
to
allow
women
to
be
educated
at
the
university
we
are
of
opinion
that
this
resolution
must
be
carried
out
in
good
faith
and
obeyed
by
the
professors
the
third
resolution
of
the
university
court
of
november
which
the
professors
to
have
separate
classes
for
women
in
no
way
derogates
from
the
resolution
of
the
court
that
women
be
admitted
to
the
study
of
in
case
such
women
as
are
matriculated
students
of
medicine
in
the
university
are
refused
instruction
by
the
individual
medical
professors
what
is
their
legal
mode
of
redress
and
against
whom
should
it
be
directed
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
university
court
can
compel
by
action
the
medical
professors
to
obey
the
resolutions
of
november
by
holding
separate
classes
for
the
education
of
women
with
respect
to
the
title
of
the
women
we
think
that
those
of
them
who
have
matriculated
and
passed
the
preliminary
examinations
have
a
title
and
may
enforce
their
rights
by
action
the
proper
form
of
action
is
we
think
a
declarator
against
the
professors
refusing
to
obey
the
resolution
of
the
university
court
with
petitory
conclusions
to
the
effect
that
they
should
be
ordained
to
hold
separate
classes
for
the
instruction
of
the
pursuers
they
receiving
their
due
remuneration
whether
in
the
first
constitution
or
charter
of
the
university
or
in
any
of
the
subsequent
statutes
there
is
anything
which
limits
the
benefits
of
the
university
to
male
students
the
charter
of
erection
and
confirmation
of
the
of
by
king
james
dated
april
granted
certain
lands
and
revenues
to
the
magistrates
and
town
council
of
edinburgh
with
a
license
to
employ
those
revenues
and
such
others
as
persons
might
bestow
on
them
in
the
erecting
of
suitable
buildings
for
the
use
of
professors
and
of
grammar
humanity
and
languages
philosophy
theology
medicine
and
laws
and
other
liberal
sciences
the
king
by
this
charter
as
interpreted
by
decision
of
the
courts
delegated
to
or
conferred
upon
the
magistrates
and
town
council
the
character
of
patron
and
founder
of
this
new
seminary
of
education
the
powers
of
superintendence
and
control
thus
conferred
upon
the
magistrates
and
council
remained
with
them
till
the
act
of
was
passed
by
which
the
more
important
powers
were
transferred
to
the
university
court
the
magistrates
and
council
never
conferred
upon
the
college
any
independent
constitution
so
as
to
enable
the
members
of
it
to
exercise
any
power
of
internal
government
as
founders
patrons
and
delegates
intrusted
by
the
royal
grant
the
magistrates
and
council
remained
in
the
full
right
of
management
regulation
and
tutelage
of
their
own
institution
act
of
parliament
was
passed
in
which
may
be
considered
as
the
charter
of
erection
of
the
university
it
narrates
the
charter
of
and
the
licence
thereby
given
to
found
a
college
and
choose
professors
and
sets
forth
the
zeal
for
the
growth
of
learning
and
his
purpose
to
grant
the
college
all
immunities
enjoyed
by
other
colleges
the
statute
then
confirms
the
erection
of
the
college
and
ratifies
all
the
mortifications
made
to
the
town
by
the
king
or
others
towards
its
support
it
bestows
on
the
college
the
name
of
college
and
grants
to
the
magistrates
favour
of
the
said
burgh
of
edinburgh
patrons
of
the
said
college
and
of
the
college
and
of
rectors
regents
bursars
and
within
the
same
all
liberties
freedoms
immunities
and
privileges
pertaining
to
a
free
college
and
that
in
as
ample
a
form
and
large
manner
as
any
college
has
or
bruickis
within
his
statute
concludes
with
ordaining
a
new
charter
to
issue
if
need
be
for
erecting
the
college
with
all
such
privileges
and
immunities
no
such
charter
was
ever
issued
but
the
statute
itself
may
be
held
equivalent
to
a
charter
it
was
a
charter
in
favour
of
the
magistrates
and
council
as
founders
and
patrons
and
in
no
way
prejudiced
but
on
the
contrary
confirmed
their
power
of
superintendence
control
and
regulation
of
all
matters
concerning
the
internal
government
of
the
university
are
of
opinion
that
in
virtue
of
the
powers
they
thus
possessed
the
magistrates
and
town
council
could
at
any
time
during
their
years
of
university
rule
have
done
what
the
university
court
did
in
grant
permission
to
women
to
be
educated
at
the
university
examining
the
records
we
find
that
the
superintendence
of
the
patrons
was
active
and
constant
they
made
at
various
times
during
the
two
centuries
and
a
half
while
their
jurisdiction
lasted
sets
of
laws
and
regulations
for
the
college
which
embrace
all
things
connected
with
the
duties
and
rights
of
professors
and
students
the
series
and
order
of
studies
the
days
and
hours
of
lecture
the
books
to
be
read
the
conduct
of
students
in
and
out
of
college
hours
the
modes
of
trial
and
graduation
the
attendance
of
the
professors
at
their
classes
attendance
at
church
dress
to
be
worn
by
students
fees
to
be
paid
these
regulations
proceed
on
the
footing
that
only
male
students
attended
the
university
many
of
them
were
inapplicable
to
females
and
we
can
not
find
any
trace
of
its
being
contemplated
by
the
patrons
that
females
might
be
students
and
we
do
not
find
any
evidence
of
a
female
having
attended
the
university
while
we
are
of
opinion
that
the
magistrates
and
council
had
the
power
to
pass
a
regulation
authorising
the
attendance
of
women
at
the
university
and
to
compel
the
professors
to
teach
them
yet
as
they
never
passed
any
such
regulation
no
women
could
have
insisted
upon
admission
to
university
education
as
a
legal
right
prior
to
university
court
by
sec
are
now
vested
with
all
the
powers
of
internal
management
and
regulation
formerly
possessed
by
the
magistrates
and
council
they
have
done
what
the
latter
never
did
although
they
lawfully
might
they
have
by
their
resolution
of
november
given
to
women
the
right
to
demand
equally
with
male
students
admission
to
the
note
r
extraordinary
history
of
the
vicissitudes
endured
by
the
lady
students
seems
at
last
to
have
reached
its
most
extraordinary
phase
it
appears
as
stated
in
our
columns
of
yesterday
that
on
saturday
last
the
medical
faculty
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
a
body
which
collectively
forms
one
of
the
of
the
college
passed
a
vote
by
a
majority
whereby
they
instructed
their
dean
deliberately
to
break
a
law
of
the
university
or
rather
expressly
him
from
complying
with
it
what
makes
the
matter
the
more
remarkable
is
that
this
special
law
was
in
the
first
instance
inaugurated
by
themselves
and
subsequently
approved
by
the
senatus
and
other
authorities
and
incorporated
in
the
official
regulations
published
in
the
it
would
seem
clear
enough
that
a
decision
which
had
been
deliberately
confirmed
by
each
university
authority
successively
and
which
had
thus
become
law
could
not
be
disturbed
by
any
one
except
after
an
equally
formal
process
of
revocation
it
is
however
well
known
that
though
all
the
bodies
enumerated
passed
the
above
regulations
by
a
majority
there
was
in
most
cases
a
dissatisfied
minority
who
wished
that
all
privileges
should
be
withheld
from
the
lady
students
it
would
have
surprised
no
one
to
hear
that
a
formal
attempt
had
been
made
to
obtain
the
withdrawal
of
the
privileges
conferred
but
the
public
were
probably
sufficiently
astonished
to
learn
yesterday
that
though
no
such
open
and
honourable
attempt
had
been
made
a
secret
was
planned
by
which
it
was
apparently
hoped
at
the
very
last
moment
when
no
appeal
to
the
senatus
or
other
authorities
was
possible
to
crush
the
hopes
of
the
medical
ladies
at
least
for
the
present
year
at
the
faculty
meeting
to
which
we
have
referred
a
vote
was
actually
passed
to
the
dean
whose
friendliness
to
the
ladies
was
well
known
from
giving
to
any
women
who
were
about
to
join
the
medical
class
the
papers
necessary
to
enable
them
to
pass
the
preliminary
examination
in
arts
which
is
indispensable
before
registration
this
examination
having
been
not
only
previously
allowed
but
actually
passed
by
numerous
ladies
on
no
less
than
four
occasions
at
this
same
notable
meeting
a
vote
was
also
passed
that
the
medical
faculty
should
disregard
alike
their
own
previous
resolutions
the
official
regulations
of
the
and
the
tickets
of
admission
already
paid
for
and
obtained
by
those
other
ladies
who
are
now
ready
to
proceed
to
their
first
professional
examination
and
accordingly
a
letter
was
sent
to
each
of
these
three
ladies
informing
them
that
their
tickets
had
been
granted
error
and
that
they
could
not
be
examined
the
sanction
of
the
senatus
academicus
as
if
that
sanction
had
not
been
already
given
in
the
most
emphatic
manner
story
is
not
a
pleasant
one
that
a
minority
obliged
to
acquiesce
in
an
act
of
liberality
on
the
part
of
the
majority
should
when
unable
to
prevail
by
fair
means
endeavour
to
compass
their
end
by
a
and
in
an
underhand
manner
is
sufficiently
discreditable
but
that
rather
than
relinquish
their
own
dogged
resolution
to
obstruct
the
ladies
these
professors
should
deliberately
abstain
from
all
previous
warning
of
the
means
they
intended
to
employ
should
allow
many
months
of
severe
study
to
be
passed
with
a
definite
aim
and
hope
and
should
then
silently
dig
a
pitfall
at
the
very
threshold
of
the
door
through
which
the
ladies
must
pass
and
hope
by
an
arbitrary
exercise
of
authority
against
a
few
wholly
unprepared
women
completely
to
destroy
their
prospects
for
the
present
year
at
least
is
something
almost
too
monstrous
to
be
believed
did
the
circumstances
admit
of
any
doubt
in
the
matter
whether
these
medical
gentlemen
really
supposed
that
by
their
unsupported
fiat
they
could
set
aside
all
the
existing
regulations
of
the
university
or
whether
they
trusted
to
the
want
of
knowledge
in
legal
matters
not
to
challenge
their
authority
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
say
but
one
would
rather
believe
in
the
ignorance
of
law
implied
by
the
former
alternative
than
in
the
lamentable
want
of
honourable
feeling
that
would
be
conveyed
in
the
latter
be
this
as
it
may
it
is
not
easy
to
exaggerate
the
damaging
effect
that
a
story
of
this
kind
is
likely
to
have
on
the
minds
of
the
public
that
such
a
line
of
conduct
be
planned
and
carried
out
by
a
body
of
men
claiming
the
name
of
gentlemen
and
belonging
to
a
profession
that
calls
itself
and
is
perhaps
as
striking
a
proof
as
could
be
given
of
the
fatally
blinding
influence
of
professional
prejudice
and
unreasoning
confess
that
the
conduct
of
the
medical
faculty
amazes
us
can
they
suppose
that
such
obstructions
are
calculated
to
stop
the
movement
why
should
they
not
show
a
little
practical
sense
and
choose
their
with
reasonable
judgment
a
single
professor
whose
classes
must
be
attended
according
to
present
regulations
might
have
hoped
successfully
to
resist
the
demand
that
he
should
teach
mixed
classes
there
are
many
people
who
do
not
look
with
particular
complacency
upon
the
efforts
of
a
few
ladies
to
obtain
a
place
in
the
medical
profession
but
paltry
persecutions
like
these
and
little
dodges
sprung
upon
them
suddenly
will
assuredly
turn
the
popular
tide
in
their
favour
the
medical
profession
seem
to
think
that
they
have
only
got
to
get
behind
these
too
devoted
students
and
shout
loud
enough
to
frighten
them
out
of
their
five
wits
they
might
surely
have
known
miss
better
by
this
time
are
the
edinburgh
medical
faculty
really
afraid
of
the
competition
of
the
ladies
do
they
look
upon
them
as
against
whom
the
doors
must
be
closed
in
spite
of
law
reason
and
liberty
they
are
welcome
to
their
fears
narrow
as
they
are
and
to
their
opinions
on
the
question
of
lady
doctors
but
we
trust
that
the
university
of
edinburgh
will
see
that
its
regulations
are
maintained
having
given
permission
to
females
to
study
medicine
under
conditions
which
are
strict
enough
and
even
somewhat
hard
the
university
must
prevent
any
combination
of
professors
from
taking
the
matter
into
their
own
hands
and
debarring
the
ladies
from
the
privileges
for
which
they
have
so
gallantly
fought
in
the
meantime
we
congratulate
the
five
ladies
on
the
prompt
spirit
in
which
they
have
repelled
the
insidious
attempt
of
a
majority
of
the
medical
faculty
we
believe
only
a
very
small
majority
to
cut
their
studies
short
we
need
not
urge
them
to
persevere
for
they
seem
to
have
that
in
predominance
but
we
think
we
can
assure
them
that
every
victory
that
they
gain
and
every
defeat
that
they
suffer
adds
to
the
number
of
their
sympathisers
and
breaks
down
no
inconsiderable
portion
of
the
mountain
of
prejudice
that
they
had
to
face
when
they
commenced
their
career
as
students
if
the
medical
professors
want
to
defeat
them
they
must
get
better
advisers
and
not
court
humiliation
their
present
counsellor
is
like
adversity
ugly
and
venomous
in
appearance
only
without
the
jewel
the
treasure
of
and
unreasonable
persecutions
which
he
carries
in
his
head
the
little
forlorn
hope
of
courageous
ladies
whose
ranks
are
thinned
from
time
to
time
by
marriage
and
other
maladies
would
hardly
be
so
likely
to
plant
their
triumphant
flag
on
the
top
of
the
castle
rock
at
october
note
s
the
following
verses
are
no
bad
indication
of
the
popular
feeling
respecting
the
incidents
narrated
above
and
this
is
rendered
the
more
characteristic
by
the
national
form
in
which
it
finds
expression
the

note
t
this
correspondence
is
so
remarkable
that
i
subjoin
it
entire
the
university
buccleuch
place
november
it
is
now
two
years
since
you
passed
a
series
of
resolutions
dated
november
to
the
effect
that
shall
be
admitted
to
the
study
of
medicine
in
the
the
time
that
has
since
elapsed
i
and
those
ladies
who
matriculated
with
me
at
that
date
have
completed
of
the
studies
necessary
for
graduation
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
nearly
five
months
ago
i
ventured
to
point
out
to
the
senatus
academicus
that
unless
further
arrangements
were
made
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
complete
the
studies
which
we
have
begun
with
your
express
sanction
after
pointing
out
the
existing
difficulties
i
ventured
further
to
make
two
suggestions
either
of
which
if
adopted
might
enable
us
to
complete
our
education
in
the
university
in
reply
however
i
was
informed
that
the
senatus
taken
the
opinion
of
counsel
with
reference
to
the
proposals
contained
in
the
memorial
of
date
june
find
themselves
unable
to
comply
with
either
of
those
understand
however
that
since
the
date
referred
to
another
legal
opinion
has
been
obtained
from
the
lord
advocate
and
sheriff
fraser
and
has
been
laid
before
the
senatus
and
by
them
forwarded
to
your
honourable
court
as
however
the
senatus
still
appear
unwilling
to
initiate
any
measure
by
which
we
may
be
relieved
from
our
present
difficulties
i
feel
constrained
now
to
appeal
to
you
in
my
own
name
and
that
of
my
to
take
such
action
as
shall
enable
us
to
complete
our
studies
beg
to
represent
to
you
that
we
have
all
paid
matriculation
fees
for
the
present
year
and
are
by
our
tickets
declared
to
be
academiæ
edinensis
and
that
yet
we
who
commenced
our
studies
in
are
unable
during
the
present
session
to
obtain
any
further
classes
whatever
towards
completing
our
required
course
of
study
understand
from
those
friends
who
have
taken
legal
opinion
on
the
subject
and
doubtless
such
opinion
will
be
laid
before
you
simultaneously
with
this
letter
that
we
are
entitled
to
demand
from
the
university
the
means
of
completing
our
studies
and
that
failing
any
other
alternative
measures
we
can
claim
the
instruction
of
the
medical
professors
to
the
extent
needed
to
complete
our
curriculum
beg
therefore
most
respectfully
to
request
that
unless
any
other
mode
of
supplying
our
needs
seems
preferable
to
you
you
will
vouchsafe
to
ordain
that
the
professors
whose
courses
we
are
bound
by
the
university
regulations
to
attend
shall
give
us
the
requisite
i
beg
to
subscribe
myself
gentlemen
your
obedient
servant
of
university
court
of
january
university
court
have
had
under
consideration
the
letters
of
miss
and
miss
louisa
stevenson
of
november
and
other
relative
documents
laid
before
them
on
behalf
of
the
women
who
have
been
admitted
by
the
regulations
of
the
court
of
november
to
study
medicine
in
the
university
these
papers
it
is
stated
that
certain
professors
of
the
faculty
of
medicine
have
declined
to
give
separate
classes
of
instruction
to
women
and
the
court
are
asked
either
to
extend
in
the
case
of
female
medical
students
the
privilege
granted
by
ordinance
by
the
commissioners
to
lecturers
not
being
professors
in
a
university
of
qualifying
for
graduation
by
their
lectures
which
privilege
is
now
restricted
to
four
of
the
prescribed
subjects
of
study
or
to
authorise
the
appointment
of
special
lecturers
to
give
in
the
university
qualifying
courses
of
instruction
in
place
of
those
professors
who
decline
to
do
so
or
to
ordain
that
the
professors
referred
to
shall
themselves
give
the
necessary
courses
of
instruction
to
women
second
course
suggested
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
the
court
or
other
university
authorities
singly
or
jointly
to
adopt
third
course
is
equally
beyond
the
power
of
the
court
the
act
of
vests
in
the
court
plenary
powers
to
deal
with
any
professor
who
shall
fail
to
discharge
his
duties
but
no
professor
can
be
compelled
to
give
courses
of
instruction
other
than
those
which
by
the
use
and
wont
of
the
university
it
has
been
the
duty
of
the
holders
of
his
chair
to
deliver
first
of
the
proposed
measures
would
imply
an
alteration
in
one
of
the
ordinances
for
graduation
in
medicine
no
clause
such
alteration
could
be
made
by
the
university
court
only
with
the
consent
expressed
in
writing
of
the
chancellor
and
with
the
approval
of
her
majesty
in
council
to
alter
in
favour
of
female
students
rules
laid
down
for
the
regulation
of
graduation
in
medicine
would
imply
an
assumption
on
the
part
of
the
court
that
the
university
of
edinburgh
has
the
power
of
granting
degrees
to
women
it
seems
to
the
court
impossible
to
them
to
assume
the
existence
of
a
power
that
is
questioned
in
many
quarters
and
which
is
both
affirmed
and
denied
by
eminent
counsel
so
long
as
these
doubts
remain
it
would
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
be
premature
to
consider
the
expediency
of
taking
steps
to
obtain
in
favour
of
female
students
an
alteration
of
an
ordinance
which
may
be
held
not
to
apply
to
women
the
court
are
unable
to
comply
with
any
of
the
specific
requests
referred
to
they
are
at
the
same
time
desirous
to
remove
so
far
as
possible
any
present
obstacle
in
the
way
of
a
complete
medical
education
being
given
to
women
provided
always
that
medical
instruction
to
women
be
imparted
in
strictly
separate
classes
court
are
of
opinion
that
the
question
under
reference
has
been
complicated
by
the
introduction
of
the
subject
of
graduation
which
is
not
essential
to
the
completion
of
a
medical
or
other
education
the
university
of
london
which
has
a
special
charter
for
the
examination
of
women
does
not
confer
degrees
upon
women
but
only
grants
them
of
if
the
applicants
in
the
present
case
would
be
content
to
seek
the
examination
of
women
by
the
university
for
certificates
of
proficiency
in
medicine
instead
of
university
degrees
the
court
believe
that
arrangements
for
accomplishing
this
object
would
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
powers
given
to
them
by
section
of
the
scotland
act
the
court
would
be
willing
to
consider
any
such
arrangements
which
might
be
submitted
to
the
university
buccleuch
place
edinburgh
january
i
have
received
from
your
secretary
a
copy
of
your
minute
of
the
instant
and
i
beg
you
to
allow
me
most
respectfully
but
at
the
same
time
most
emphatically
to
protest
against
the
decision
therein
contained
on
the
following
grounds
that
when
women
were
admitted
to
study
the
profession
of
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
and
were
required
to
pay
the
ordinary
matriculation
fees
as
academiæ
in
addition
to
those
for
instruction
it
was
believed
to
be
involved
that
subject
only
to
the
restrictions
laid
down
in
the
regulations
of
november
we
should
be
allowed
to
complete
our
education
and
should
as
a
matter
of
course
proceed
to
the
degree
of
no
official
intimation
to
the
contrary
being
given
to
us
at
the
time
nor
indeed
until
now
when
we
have
half
completed
our
university
curriculum
you
will
allow
me
to
remind
you
further
that
we
have
very
high
legal
authority
for
believing
that
these
expectations
were
well
founded
and
that
matriculation
does
involve
necessarily
all
the
privileges
of
studentship
including
graduation
as
was
indeed
recently
admitted
by
a
legal
professor
who
has
always
been
one
of
our
most
determined
opponents
when
addressing
your
honourable
court
in
favour
of
rescinding
the
present
regulations
that
except
with
a
view
to
ultimate
graduation
it
was
quite
meaningless
to
require
us
to
pass
as
we
did
the
preliminary
examination
in
arts
which
has
not
any
necessary
connection
with
the
study
of
medicine
itself
but
is
expressly
stated
to
be
first
examination
the
medical
that
we
have
all
along
pursued
our
studies
with
a
view
to
the
further
professional
examinations
that
in
the
resolutions
passed
by
the
medical
faculty
on
july
it
was
distinctly
stated
that
be
allowed
to
attend
medical
classes
and
to
receive
certificates
of
attendance
qualifying
for
examination
that
further
on
april
the
senatus
academicus
expressly
ordained
that
exactly
the
same
university
certificates
of
attendance
should
be
issued
to
students
of
both
sexes
for
the
special
purpose
of
qualifying
for
professional
examination
that
no
kind
of
official
notice
was
ever
given
to
us
that
a
doubt
existed
respecting
our
admission
to
the
ordinary
professional
examinations
until
certain
of
our
number
had
completed
their
preparations
for
the
first
professional
examination
and
had
paid
their
fees
for
and
received
tickets
of
admission
to
the
same
and
that
when
the
matter
was
brought
before
the
senatus
it
was
by
them
decided
that
ladies
should
be
admitted
to
the
examination
and
accordingly
the
ladies
in
question
were
examined
in
the
ordinary
course
and
passed
the
examination
successfully
that
under
the
existing
act
of
parliament
it
is
impossible
for
any
person
to
practise
medicine
under
legal
sanction
without
a
distinct
as
defined
by
the
said
act
of
parliament
that
the
only
which
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
to
grant
is
the
ordinary
medical
degree
and
that
no
of
would
possess
the
slightest
legal
value
unless
a
special
act
of
parliament
was
passed
making
such
certificates
registrable
qualifications
that
the
difficulty
and
expense
of
procuring
such
a
special
act
of
parliament
would
be
very
much
greater
than
that
of
obtaining
the
sanction
of
the
queen
in
council
to
such
minor
alterations
in
the
university
ordinances
as
are
alone
necessary
to
enable
us
to
complete
our
education
by
means
of
additional
classes
even
if
your
honourable
court
declines
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
the
university
that
we
are
informed
on
high
authority
that
it
is
at
present
within
the
power
of
your
honourable
court
in
conjunction
with
the
senatus
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
within
the
university
without
any
external
sanction
either
by
ordaining
that
the
present
professors
shall
instruct
women
in
separate
classes
or
by
appointing
special
lecturers
for
that
purpose
as
regards
the
former
course
i
venture
to
remark
that
several
professors
in
the
faculty
of
arts
are
already
delivering
two
or
more
lectures
daily
and
that
as
i
presume
it
was
always
contemplated
that
each
professor
should
instruct
all
matriculated
students
desiring
to
study
his
subject
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
it
might
become
necessary
from
the
number
of
students
or
otherwise
for
the
medical
professors
also
to
be
required
to
deliver
two
courses
and
that
therefore
it
could
hardly
be
considered
a
hardship
if
they
should
be
required
to
deliver
a
second
course
with
proper
remuneration
for
the
same
to
those
matriculated
students
who
are
forbidden
by
the
university
to
attend
in
the
ordinary
classes
as
regards
the
second
alternative
i
believe
that
it
has
never
been
doubted
that
the
senatus
and
university
court
conjointly
have
the
power
of
appointing
any
number
of
assistants
or
special
lecturers
in
any
faculty
if
they
are
required
for
the
efficient
performance
of
the
teaching
of
the
university
that
as
the
main
difficulty
before
your
honourable
court
seems
to
be
that
regarding
graduation
with
which
we
are
not
immediately
concerned
at
this
moment
we
are
quite
willing
to
rest
our
claims
to
ultimate
graduation
on
the
facts
as
they
stand
up
to
the
present
date
and
in
case
your
honourable
court
will
now
make
arrangements
whereby
we
can
continue
our
education
we
will
undertake
not
to
draw
any
arguments
in
favour
of
our
right
to
graduation
from
such
future
arrangements
so
that
they
may
at
least
be
made
without
prejudice
to
the
present
legal
position
of
the
university
that
we
are
informed
by
high
legal
authorities
that
we
are
entitled
as
matriculated
students
to
demand
from
the
university
complete
arrangements
for
our
instruction
and
that
we
are
further
entitled
to
bring
an
action
of
declarator
to
obtain
the
same
from
the
several
professors
if
no
alternative
measures
are
devised
and
that
we
shall
inevitably
be
driven
to
pursue
this
course
with
whatever
reluctance
if
your
honourable
court
persistently
refuses
to
make
in
any
form
whatever
such
arrangements
as
may
enable
us
to
complete
our
education
and
to
obtain
a
legal
qualification
to
practise
commending
the
above
considerations
to
your
most
favourable
notice
i
have
the
honour
the
secretary
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
february
i
am
desired
by
the
university
court
to
inform
you
that
your
letter
dated
the
ultimo
has
been
laid
before
them
and
considered
reply
i
am
to
say
that
in
several
points
of
your
view
of
the
past
history
and
present
position
of
the
question
relative
to
the
medical
education
of
women
in
edinburgh
the
court
are
unable
to
concur
going
into
the
discussions
which
might
be
raised
on
these
points
it
appears
to
the
court
that
it
is
only
necessary
for
them
to
enter
upon
the
subject
of
your
ninth
paragraph
in
which
you
say
as
the
main
difficulty
before
your
honourable
court
seems
to
be
that
regarding
graduation
with
which
we
are
not
immediately
concerned
at
this
moment
we
are
quite
willing
to
rest
our
claims
to
ultimate
graduation
on
the
facts
as
they
stand
up
to
the
present
date
and
in
case
your
honourable
court
will
now
make
arrangements
whereby
we
can
continue
our
education
we
will
undertake
not
to
draw
any
arguments
in
favour
of
our
right
to
graduation
from
such
future
arrangements
so
that
they
may
at
least
be
made
without
prejudice
to
the
present
legal
position
of
the
this
i
am
desired
to
inform
you
that
you
appear
to
ask
no
more
than
was
offered
by
the
court
in
their
resolution
of
the
ultimo
in
which
it
was
stated
that
while
the
court
were
restrained
by
legal
doubts
as
to
the
power
of
the
university
to
grant
degrees
to
women
from
considering
expediency
of
taking
steps
to
obtain
in
favour
of
female
students
an
alteration
of
an
ordinance
which
might
be
held
not
to
apply
to
women
they
were
the
same
time
desirous
to
remove
so
far
as
possible
any
present
obstacle
in
the
way
of
a
complete
medical
education
being
given
to
women
provided
always
that
medical
instruction
to
women
be
imparted
in
strictly
separate
the
assumption
therefore
that
while
you
at
present
decline
the
offer
made
by
the
court
with
reference
to
certificates
of
proficiency
you
now
ask
merely
that
arrangements
should
be
made
for
completing
the
medical
education
of
yourself
and
the
other
ladies
on
behalf
of
whom
you
write
i
am
to
state
that
the
court
are
quite
ready
to
meet
your
views
if
therefore
the
names
of
teachers
of
the
required
medical
subjects
be
submitted
by
yourself
or
by
the
senatus
the
court
will
be
prepared
to
consider
the
respective
fitness
of
the
persons
so
named
to
be
authorised
to
hold
medical
classes
for
women
who
have
in
this
or
former
sessions
been
matriculated
students
of
the
university
and
also
the
conditions
and
regulations
under
which
such
classes
should
be
held
is
however
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
such
arrangements
are
not
to
be
founded
on
as
implying
any
right
in
women
to
obtain
medical
degrees
or
as
conferring
any
such
right
upon
the
students
referred
to
have
christison
the
university
buccleuch
place
february
i
beg
to
thank
you
sincerely
for
the
resolution
to
which
you
came
on
monday
the
and
which
if
i
understand
it
rightly
will
i
trust
prove
a
satisfactory
solution
of
our
present
difficulties
will
if
you
wish
it
very
gladly
prepare
and
submit
to
your
honourable
court
a
list
of
lecturers
and
of
gentlemen
prepared
to
qualify
as
such
who
may
with
your
sanction
instruct
us
in
the
various
subjects
which
we
have
to
study
but
before
doing
so
i
venture
to
beg
for
official
confirmation
of
my
interpretation
of
your
late
resolution
in
two
essential
particulars
trust
that
i
am
correct
in
understanding
that
though
you
at
present
give
us
no
pledge
respecting
our
ultimate
graduation
it
is
your
intention
to
consider
the
proposed
courses
as
for
graduation
and
that
you
will
take
such
measures
as
may
be
necessary
to
secure
that
they
will
be
accepted
if
it
is
subsequently
determined
that
the
university
has
the
power
of
granting
degrees
to
women
that
we
shall
be
admitted
in
due
course
to
the
ordinary
professional
examinations
on
presentation
of
the
proper
certificates
of
attendance
on
the
said
classes
will
i
am
sure
understand
that
while
we
are
quite
willing
to
accept
present
arrangements
for
instruction
without
any
pledge
that
they
will
confer
a
right
to
graduation
it
would
be
useless
for
us
to
attend
any
classes
which
would
be
incapable
of
qualifying
for
graduation
and
impossible
for
us
to
acquiesce
in
any
agreement
which
might
prejudice
the
claim
which
we
believe
ourselves
to
possess
to
the
ultimate
attainment
of
the
medical
i
am
the
secretary
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
february
your
letter
dated
instant
has
been
considered
by
the
university
court
in
it
you
say
trust
that
i
am
correct
in
understanding
that
though
you
at
present
give
us
no
pledge
respecting
our
ultimate
graduation
it
is
your
intention
to
consider
the
proposed
courses
as
for
graduation
and
that
you
will
take
such
measures
as
may
be
necessary
to
secure
that
they
will
be
so
accepted
if
it
is
subsequently
determined
that
the
university
has
the
power
of
granting
degrees
to
women
that
we
shall
be
admitted
in
due
course
to
the
ordinary

on
presentation
of

proper
certificates
of
attendance
on
the
said
reply
i
am
desired
to
point
out
that
no
courses
beyond
the
number
of
four
allowed
by
the
ordinance
of
the
universities
commissioners
could
either
qualify
for
graduation
or
for
the
ordinary
professional
examinations
except
under
a
change
in
the
ordinance
which
change
could
be
made
only
by
a
resolution
of
the
court
sanctioned
by
the
chancellor
and
approved
by
the
queen
in
council
court
have
already
declared
in
their
resolution
of
the
of
january
last
that
they
can
not
even
enter
on
the
consideration
of
the
expediency
of
such
a
change
in
the
ordinance
until
the
legality
of
female
graduation
has
been
determined
would
not
only
be
premature
for
the
court
to
express
at
present
any
views
or
intentions
on
the
points
to
which
you
refer
but
it
would
be
clearly
contrary
to
their
duty
to
do
so
for
supposing
the
legal
question
to
be
decided
in
a
way
favourable
to
your
wishes
those
points
would
then
doubtless
be
referred
to
the
court
for
their
decision
when
various
parties
would
probably
desire
to
be
heard
with
regard
to
them
am
to
add
that
in
your
letter
of
the
january
you
appeared
merely
to
ask
that
the
court
now
make
arrangements
whereby
we
can
continue
our
education
and
that
the
court
offered
as
stated
in
my
letter
of
the
to
meet
your
views
in
the
only
way
which
appeared
to
lie
within
their
competency
the
court
are
still
of
opinion
that
it
is
quite
impossible
for
them
at
present
to
add
anything
to
that
i
have
the
honour
christison
secretary
note
u
i
am
anxious
to
guard
myself
from
being
supposed
to
attribute
to
scotch
nationality
the
exceptionally
bad
conduct
of
certain
students
in
edinburgh
during
i
can
not
but
hope
that
such
behaviour
as
i
have
described
would
have
been
impossible
in
any
english
medical
school
but
in
so
saying
i
do
not
by
any
means
wish
to
imply
that
scotch
students
have
less
good
feeling
than
others
when
their
superiors
set
them
an
example
of
courtesy
in
point
of
fact
moreover
some
of
those
who
took
most
pains
to
make
themselves
obnoxious
were
not
scotchmen
at
all
but
englishmen
of
an
extremely
low
class
some
scotch
lads
no
doubt
behaved
very
badly
but
on
the
other
hand
the
guard
of
honour

was
almost
wholly
composed
