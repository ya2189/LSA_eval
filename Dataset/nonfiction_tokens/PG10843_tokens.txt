interests
opportunity
and

two
strong
interests
come
to
expression
in
this
report
the
one
in
the
study
of
the
adaptive
or
ideational
behavior
of
the
monkeys
and
the
apes
and
the
other
in
adequate
and
permanent
provision
for
the
thorough
study
of
all
aspects
of
the
lives
of
these
animals
the
values
of
these
interests
and
of
the
tasks
which
they
have
led
me
to
undertake
are
so
widely
recognized
by
biologists
that
i
need
not
pause
to
justify
or
define
them
i
shall
instead
attempt
to
make
a
contribution
of
fact
on
the
score
of
each
interest
while
recognizing
that
the
task
of
prospecting
for
an
anthropoid
or
primate
station
may
in
its
outcome
prove
incomparably
more
important
for
the
biological
and
sociological
sciences
and
for
human
welfare
than
my
experimental
study
of
ideational
behavior
i
give
the
latter
first
place
in
this
report
reserving
for
the
concluding
section
an
account
of
the
situation
regarding
our
knowledge
of
the
monkeys
apes
and
other
primates
and
a
description
of
a
plan
and
program
for
the
and
long
continued
study
of
these
organisms
in
a
permanent
station
or
research
institute
in
a
long
desired
opportunity
came
to
me
to
devote
myself
undividedly
to
tasks
which
i
have
designated
above
as
prospecting
for
an
anthropoid
station
and
experimenting
with
monkeys
and
apes
first
of
all
the
interruption
of
my
academic
duties
by
sabbatical
leave
gave
me
free
time
but
in
addition
to
this
freedom
for
research
i
needed
animals
and
equipment
these
too
happily
were
most
satisfactorily
provided
as
i
shall
now
describe
when
in
while
already
myself
engaged
in
seeking
the
establishment
of
an
anthropoid
station
i
heard
of
the
founding
of
such
an
institution
at
orotava
tenerife
the
canary
islands
i
immediately
made
inquiries
of
the
founder
of
the
station
doctor
max
rothmann
of
berlin
concerning
his
plans
rothmann
as
a
result
of
our
correspondence
i
was
invited
to
visit
and
make
use
of
the
facilities
of
the
orotava
station
and
to
consider
with
its
founder
the
possibility
of
coöperative
work
instead
of
the
establishing
of
an
american
station
this
invitation
i
gratefully
accepted
with
the
expectation
of
spending
the
greater
part
of
the
year
on
the
island
of
tenerife
but
the
outbreak
of
the
war
rendered
my
plan
impracticable
while
at
the
same
time
destroying
all
reasonable
ground
for
hope
of
profitable
coöperation
with
the
germans
in
the
study
of
the
anthropoids
in
august
doctor
rothmann
died
presumably
the
station
still
exists
at
orotava
in
the
interests
of
certain
psychological
and
physiological
research
so
far
as
i
know
there
are
as
yet
no
published
reports
of
studies
made
at
this
station
it
seems
from
every
point
of
view
desirable
that
american
psychologists
should
without
regard
to
this
initial
attempt
of
the
germans
to
provide
for
anthropoid
research
further
the
establishment
of
a
well
equipped
american
station
for
the
study
not
only
of
the
anthropoid
apes
but
of
all
of
the
lower
primates

at
end
of
report
in
the
early
months
of
the
war
while
i
was
making
every
effort
to
obtain
reliable
information
concerning
conditions
in
the
canary
islands
i
received
an
urgent
invitation
from
my
friend
and
former
student
doctor
hamilton
to
make
use
of
his
collection
of
animals
and
laboratory
at
montecito
california
during
my
leave
of
absence
from
harvard
this
invitation
i
most
gladly
accepted
and
in
february
i
established
myself
in
santa
barbara
in
convenient
proximity
to
doctor
private
laboratory
where
for
more
than
six
months
i
was
able
to
work
uninterruptedly
under
nearly
ideal
conditions
doctor
hamilton
without
reserve
placed
at
my
disposal
his
entire
collection
of
animals
laboratory
and
equipment
provided
innumerable
conveniences
for
my
work
and
in
addition
bore
the
entire
expense
of
my
investigation
i
can
not
adequately
thank
him
for
his
kindness
nor
make
satisfactory
acknowledgment
here
of
his
generous
aid
thanks
to
his
sympathetic
interest
and
to
the
courtesy
of
the
mccormick
family
on
whose
estate
the
laboratory
was
located
my
work
was
done
under
wholly
delightful
conditions
and
with
assistance
from
ramon
jimenez
and
frank
van
den
bergh
which
was
invaluable
the
former
aided
me
most
intelligently
in
the
care
of
the
animals
and
the
construction
of
apparatus
and
the
latter
especially
was
of
very
real
service
in
connection
with
many
of
my
experiments
the
collection
of
animals
which
doctor
hamilton
placed
at
my
disposal
consisted
of
ten
monkeys
and
one
orang
utan
the
monkeys
represented
either
audebert
cuvier
or
the
hybrid
of
these
two
species
elliot
there
were
two
eunuchs
five
males
and
three
females
all
were
thoroughly
acclimated
having
lived
in
montecito
either
from
birth
or
for
several
years
the
orang
utan
was
a
young
specimen
of
hoppius
obtained
from
a
san
francisco
dealer
in
october
for
my
use
his
age
at
that
time
as
judged
by
his
size
and
the
presence
of
milk
teeth
was
not
more
than
five
years
so
far
as
i
could
discover
he
was
a
perfectly
normal
healthy
and
active
individual
on
june
his
weight
was
pounds
his
height
inches
and
his
chest
girt
inches
on
august
of
the
same
year
the
three
measurements
were
and
pounds
inches
and
inches
for
the
major
portion
of
my
experimental
work
only
three
of
the
eleven
animals
were
used
a
growing
male
monkey
known
as
sobke
a
mature
male
called
skirrl
and
the
young
orang

which
had
been
named

an
excellent

the
immediate

of
the
laboratory
figure

is
a
portrait
of
julius
taken
in
the
latter
part
of
august
by
reason
of
the
heavy
growth
of
hair
he
appeared
considerably
older
as
well
as
larger
at
this
time
than
when
the

by
doctor
hamilton
but
this
prior
work
in
no
way
interfered
with
my
own
investigation
doctor
hamilton
has
accumulated
a
large
mass
of
the
most
valuable
and
interesting
observations
on
the
behavior
of
monkeys
and
he
more
thoroughly
understands
them
than
any
other
observer
of
whom
i
have
knowledge
much
to
my
regret
and
embarrassment
in
connection
with
the
present
report
he
has
thus
far
published
only
a
small
portion
of
his
data
hamilton
in
his
most
recent
paper
on
a
study
of
sexual
tendencies
in
monkeys
and
baboons
he
has
given
important
information
concerning
several
of
the
monkeys
which
i
have
observed
for
the
convenience
of
readers
who
may
make
use
of
both
his
reports

doctor

this
gave
us
opportunity
to
adapt

of

ii
observational
problems
and
methods
my
chief
observational
task
in
montecito
was
the
study
of
ideational
behavior
or
of
such
adaptive
behavior
in
monkeys
and
apes
as
corresponds
to
the
ideational
behavior
of
man
it
was
my
plan
to
determine
so
far
as
possible
in
the
time
at
my
disposal
the
existence
or
absence
of
ideas
and
the
rôle
which
they
play
in
the
solution
of
problems
by
monkeys
and
apes
i
had
in
mind
the
behavioristic
form
of
the
perennial
questions
do
these
animals
think
do
they
reason
and
if
so
what
is
the
nature
of
these
processes
as
indicated
by
the
characteristics
of
their
adaptive
behavior
my
work
although
obviously
preliminary
and
incomplete
differs
from
most
of
the
previous
studies
of
the
complex
behavior
of
the
infrahuman
primates
in
that
i
relied
chiefly
upon
a
specially
devised
method
and
applied
it
systematically
over
a
period
of
several
months
the
work
was
intensive
and
quantitative
instead
of
more
or
less
incidental
casual
and
qualitative
as
has
usually
been
the
case
naturally
during
the
course
of
my
special
study
of
ideational
behavior
observations
were
made
relative
to
various
other
aspects
of
the
life
of
my
subjects
such
for
example
are
my
notes
on
the
use
of
the
hands
the
instincts
the
emotions
and
the
natural
aptitudes
of
individuals
it
is
indeed
impossible
to
observe
any
of
the
primates
without
noting
most
interesting
and
illuminating
activities
and
although
the
major
portion
of
my
time
was
spent
in
hard
and
monotonous
work
with
my
experimental
apparatus
i
found
time
each
day
to
get
into
intimate
touch
with
the
free
activities
of
my
subjects
and
to
observe
their
social
relations
and
varied
expressions
of
individuality
as
a
result
of
my
close
acquaintance
with
this
band
of
primates
i
feel
more
keenly
than
ever
before
the
necessity
of
taking
into
account
in
connection
with
all
experimental
analyses
of
behavior
the
temperamental
characteristics
experience
and
affective
peculiarities
of
individuals
the
light
which
i
have
obtained
on
the
general
problem
of
ideation
has
come
first
through
a
method
which
i
have
rather
inaptly
named
the
method
and
second
and
more
incidentally
through
a
variety
of
supplementary
methods
which
are
described
in
section
iv
of
this
report
these
supplementary
methods
are
simple
tests
of
ideation
rather
than
systematic
modes
of
research
they
differ
from
my
chief
method
among
other
respects
in
that
they
have
been
used
by
various
investigators
during
the
past
ten
or
fifteen
years
it
was
not
my
aim
to
repeat
precisely
the
observations
made
by
others
but
instead
to
verify
some
of
them
and
more
especially
to
throw
additional
light
on
my
main
problem
and
to
further
the
analysis
of
complex
behavior
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
method
was
devised
by
me
three
years
ago
as
a
means
of
obtaining
strictly
comparable
objective
data
concerning
the
ability
of
various
types
and
conditions
of
animals
the
method
was
first
tried
with
human
subjects
in
the
psychopathic
hospital
boston
with
a
crude
keyboard
apparatus
which
however
proved
wholly
satisfactory
as
a
means
of
demonstrating
its
value
it
has
since
been
applied
by
means
of
mechanisms
especially
adapted
to
the
structure
and
activities
of
the
organisms
to
the
study
of
the
behavior
of
the
crow
pig
rat
and
ringdove
yerkes
coburn
and
yerkes
yerkes
and
coburn
the
method
has
also
been
applied
with
most
gratifying
results
to
the
study
of
the
characteristics
of
ideational
behavior
in
human
defectives
children
and
adults
and
in
subjects
afflicted
with
various
forms
of
mental
disease
it
is
at
present
being
tried
out
as
a
practical
test
in
connection
with
vocational
guidance
and
various
forms
of
institutional
examination
such
as
psychopathic
hospital
and
court
examinations
as
no
adequate
description
of
the
method
has
yet
been
published
to
which
i
can
here
refer
it
will
be
necessary
to
present
its
salient
characteristics
along
with
a
description
of
the
special
form
of
apparatus
which
was
found
suitable
for
use
with
monkeys
and
apes
the
method
is
so
planned
as
to
enable
the
observer
to
present
to
any
type
or
condition
of
organism
which
he
wishes
to
study
any
one
or
all
of
a
series
of
problems
ranging
from
the
extremely
simple
to
the
complex
and
difficultly
soluble
all
of
the
problems
however
are
completely
soluble
by
an
organism
of
excellent
ideational
ability
for
the
human
subject
the
solution
of
the
easiest
problem
of
all
requires
almost
no
effort
whereas
even
moderately
difficult
problems
may
require
many
repetitions
of
effort
and
hours
or
days
of
application
to
the
task
in
each
case
the
solution
of
the
problem
depends
upon
the
perception
of
a
certain
constant
relation
among
a
series
of
objects
to
which
the
subject
is
required
to
attend
and
respond
such
relations
are
for
example
secondness
from
one
end
of
the
group
middleness
simple
alternation
of
ends
or
progressive
movement
by
constant
steps
from
one
end
of
a
group
to
the
other
it
is
possible
to
present
such
relational
problems
by
means
of
relatively
simple
in
their
essential
features
all
of
the
several
types
of
apparatus
designed
by
the
writer
and
used
either
by
him
or
by
his
students
and
assistants
are
the
same
they
consist
of
a
series
of
precisely
similar
any
one
or
all
of
which
may
be
used
in
connection
with
a
given
observation
these
are
so
chosen
as
to
be
suited
to
the
structure
and
of
the
animal
to
be
studied
for
the
human
being
the
mechanism
consists
of
a
simple
key
and
the
total
apparatus
is
a
bank
of
keys
with
such
electrical
connections
as
are
necessary
to
enable
the
observer
to
obtain
satisfactory
records
of
the
subject
behavior
let
us
suppose
the
bank
of
keys
as
was
actually
the
case
in
my
first
form
of
apparatus
to
consist
of
twelve
separate
and
let
us
suppose
further
the
constant
relation
problem
on
the
basis
of
which
the
subject
is
required
to
react
to
be
that
of
middleness
it
is
evident
that
in
successive
trials
or
experiments
the
keys
must
be
presented
to
the
subject
in
odd
groups
the
possibilities
being
groups
of
or
if
for
a
particular
observation
the
experimenter
wishes
to
present
the
first
three
keys
at
the
left
end
of
the
keyboard
he
pushes
back
the
remaining
nine
keys
so
that
they
can
not
be
operated
and
requires
the
subject
to
select
from
the
group
of
three
keys
the
one
which
on
being
pressed
causes
a
signal
to
appear
it
is
of
course
the
clearly
understood
task
of
the
subject
to
learn
to
select
the
correct
key
in
the
group
on
first
trial
this
becomes
possible
only
as
the
subject
observes
the
relation
of
the
key
which
produces
the
desired
effect
to
the
other
keys
in
the
group
on
the
completion
of
a
reaction
to
the
group
of
three
keys
a
group
of
seven
keys
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
keyboard
may
for
example
be
presented
similarly
the
subject
is
required
to
discover
with
the
minimum
number
of
trials
the
correct
thus
time
after
time
the
experimenter
presents
a
different
group
of
keys
so
that
the
subject
in
no
two
successive
trials
is
making
use
of
the
same
portion
of
the
keyboard
it
is
therefore
impossible
for
him
to
react
to
spatial
relations
in
the
ordinary
sense
and
manner
and
unless
he
can
perceive
and
appropriately
respond
to
the
particular
relation
which
constitutes
the
only
constant
characteristic
of
the
correct
for
a
particular
problem
he
can
not
solve
the
problem
or
at
least
can
not
solve
it
ideationally
and
on
the
basis
of
a
small
number
of
observations
or
trials
for
the
various
infrahuman
animals
whose
ideational
behavior
has
been
studied
by
means
of
this
method
it
has
been
found
eminently
satisfactory
to
use
as
a
series
of
similar
boxes
each
with
an
entrance
and
an
exit
door
an
incentive
to
the
selection
of
the
right
box
in
a
particular
test
is
supplied
by
food
a
small
quantity
of
which
is
placed
in
a
covered
receptacle
beyond
the
exit
door
of
each
of
the
boxes
each
time
an
animal
enters
a
wrong
box
it
is
punished
for
its
mistake
by
being
confined
in
that
box
for
a
certain
period
ranging
from
five
seconds
to
as
much
as
two
minutes
with
various
individuals
or
types
of
organism
this
discourages
random
hasty
or
careless
choices
when
the
right
box
is
selected
the
exit
door
is
immediately
raised
thus
uncovering
the
food
which
serves
as
a
reward
after
eating
the
food
thus
provided
the
animal
according
to
training
returns
to
the
starting
point
and
eagerly
awaits
an
opportunity
to
attempt
once
more
to
find
the
reward
which
it
has
learned
to
expect
with
this
form
of
the
apparatus
the
boxes
among
which
choice
may
be
made
are
indicated
by
the
raising
opening
of
the
front
door
since
with
various
birds
and
mammals
the
box
form
of
apparatus
had
proved
most
satisfactory
i
planned
the
primate
apparatus
along
similar
lines
aiming
simply
to
adapt
it
to
the
somewhat
different
motor
equipment
and
destructive
tendencies
of
the
monkeys
i

now

describe

this

having
been
especially
planned
for
it
with
respect
to

as
well
as
dimensions
and

it
was
unfortunately
impossible
to
obtain
photographs
showing
the
whole
of
the
apparatus
but
it
is
hoped
that
the
four
partial
views
of
plate

may
aid
the
reader
who
is
unfamiliar
with
previously
described
similar
devices
to
grasp
readily
the
chief
points
of
construction
in
this
plate

shows
the
front
of
the
complete
apparatus

presented
to
the

he
stood
on
the

looked
over
the
entire

is
an
iron
staple
used
to
receive
a
sliding

which
could
be
operated
from
the
observer
bench
as
a
means
of
locking
the
doors
after
they
had
been
closed
the
space
beyond
the
exit
doors
was
used
as
an
alleyway
for
the
return
of
the
animals
to
the
starting
point
it
will
be
necessary
at
various
points
in
later
descriptions
to
refer
to
these
several
figures
but
further
description
of
them
will
be
more
readily
appreciated
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
ground
plan
of
the
apparatus
presented
as

with
the

from
which
he
has
direct
access

the
animals
and
can
bring
them
into
the

the
mechanism
proper
consisting
of
nine
similar
boxes
nine
were
used
instead
of
twelve
as
a
matter
of
convenience
of
construction
not
because
this
smaller

otherwise
preferable

these
boxes
are
numbered
to

this
numbering
was
adhered
to
in
the
recording
of
results
throughout
the
investigation
the
other
important
portions
of
the
apparatus
are
the

with
its

and
the
observer
writing

in
the
construction
of
this
large
apparatus
it
was
necessary
to
make
provision
for
the
extremely
destructive
tendencies
of
monkeys
and
anthropoid
apes
hence
the
apparent
cumbersomeness
of
certain
portions
it
was
equally
necessary
to
provide
for
the
protection
of
the
observer
and
the
prevention
of
escape
of
the
subjects
by
completely
covering
the
apparatus
and
alleyways
with
a
heavy
wire
netting
each
of
the
eighteen
doors
of
the
boxes
and
in
addition
doors
and
of
the
runway
d
were
operated
by
the
observer
from
his
bench
c
by
means
of
weighted
window
cords
which
were
carried
by
pulleys
appropriately
placed
above
the
apparatus
each
weight
was
so
chosen
as
to
be
just
sufficient
to
hold
its
door
in
position
after
the
experimenter
had
raised
it
for
the
convenience
of
the
experimenter
in
the
rapid
operation
of
the
doors
the
weights
for
the
doors
of
runway
d
were
painted
gray
those
for
the
entrance
doors
white
and
those
for
the
exit
doors
black
in
each
entrance
door
as
is
shown
in
figure
of
plate
iv
a
window
was
cut
so
that
the
experimenter
might
watch
the
animal
after
it
had
entered
a
given
box
and
especially
note
when
it
left
the
box
after
having
received
its
reward
this
window
was
covered
with
wire
netting
no
such
windows
were
necessary
in
the
exit
doors
but
to
them
were
attached
heavy
galvanized
iron
flanges
which
served
to
cover
the
food
receptacles
one
of
these
flanges
is
labelled
o
in

the
food
receptacles
were
provided
by
boring
holes
in
a
by

timber
securely
nailed
to
the
floor
immediately
outside
of
the
exit
doors
into
these
holes
aluminum
cups
fitted
snugly

the
iron
flanges
when

of
the
several

when
they

but
as
two
of
the
subjects
after
a
time
learned
to
open
the
doors
from
either
outside
or
inside
the
boxes
it
became
necessary
to
introduce
locking
devices
which
could
be
operated
by
the
experimenter
from
the
observation
bench
this
was
readily
accomplished
by
cutting
holes
in
the

permitted
an
iron
staple
screwed
to
the
lower
edge
of
each
door
to
project
through

floor
through
these
staples
by
means
of
a

for
each
of

the
observer
was
able
to
slide
a
wooden
bar
placed
beneath
the
floor
of
the

thus
locking
or
unlocking
either
the

the

or
both
in
the
case
of
any
one
of
the
nine
boxes
since
figure
is
drawn
to
scale
it
will
be
needless
to
give
more
than
a
few
of
the
dimensions
of
the
apparatus
each
of
the
boxes
was
inches
long
inches
wide
and
inches
deep
inside
measurements
the
alleys
d
i
and
h
were
inches
and
g
inches
wide
by
feet
deep
the
doors
of
the
several
boxes
were
inches
wide
by
feet
high
while
those
in
the
alleyways
were
inches
wide
by
feet
high
the
e
of
figure
was
feet
inches
by
feet
by
feet
in
depth
in
order
that
the
apparatus
might
be
used
with
adult
human
subjects
conveniently
if
such
use
should
prove
desirable
the
depth
throughout
was
made
feet
and
it
was
therefore
possible
for
the
experimenter
to
walk
about
erect
in
it
the
experimental
procedure
was
briefly
as
follows
a
small
quantity
of
food
having
been
placed
in
each
of
the
food
cups
and
covered
by
the
metal
flanges
on
the
exit
doors
the
experimenter
raised
door
of
figure
and
then
opened
door
and
the
door
of
the
cage
in
which
the
desired
subject
was
confined
after
the
latter
in
search
of
food
had
entered
the
runway
d
the
experimenter
lowered
door
to
keep
it
in
this
runway
and
immediately
proceeded
to
set
the
for
an
experiment
trial
let
us
suppose
that
the
first
setting
to
be
tried
involved
all
of
the
nine
boxes
each
of
the
entrance
doors
would
therefore
be
raised
let
us
further
suppose
that
the
right
door
is
defined
as
the
middle
one
of
the
group
with
the
apparatus
properly
set
the
experimenter
next
raises
door
thus
admitting
the
animal
to
the
any
one
of
the
nine
boxes
may
now
be
entered
by
it
but
if
any
except
number
the
middle
member
of
the
group
be
entered
the
entrance
door
is
immediately
lowered
and
both
the
exit
and
entrance
doors
locked
in
position
so
that
the
animal
is
forced
to
remain
in
the
box
for
a
stated
period
say
thirty
seconds
at
the
expiration
of
this
time
the
entrance
door
is
raised
and
the
animal
allowed
to
retrace
its
steps
and
make
another
choice
when
the
middle
box
is
chosen
the
entrance
door
is
lowered
and
the
exit
door
immediately
raised
thus
uncovering
the
food
which
the
animal
eats
as
a
rule
by
my
monkeys
and
ape
the
reward
was
eaten
in
the
alleyway
g
instead
of
in
the
box
as
soon
as
the
food
has
been
eaten
the
exit
door
is
lowered
by
the
experimenter
and
the
animal
returns
by
way
of
g
and
h
to
runway
d
where
it
awaits
its
next
trial
as
rewards
bananas
and
peanuts
were
found
very
satisfactory
and
although
occasionally
other
foods
were
supplied
in
small
quantities
they
were
on
the
whole
less
constantly
desired
than
the
former
four
problems
which
had
previously
been
presented
to
other
organisms
were
in
precisely
the
same
form
presented
to
the
three
primates
these
problems
may
be
described
briefly
by
definition
of
the

and
the
first
at

the

of
the

it
was
my
intention
to
present
these
four
problems
in
order
to
each
of
the
three
animals
proceeding
with
them
as
rapidly
as
they
were
solved
but
as
it
happened
only
one
of
the
three
subjects
got
as
far
as
the
fourth
problem
when
observations
had
to
be
discontinued
sobke
was
well
along
with
the
last
or
fourth
problem
skirrl
was
at
work
at
the
third
problem
and
julius
had
failed
to
solve
the
second
problem
for
each
of
the
problems
a
series
of
ten
different
settings
of
the
doors
was
determined
upon
in

these
settings
differ
from
those
employed
in
a
similar
investigation
with
the
pig
only
in
that
the
numbering
of
the

is
reversed
in
the

to
a
given
subject
each
day
the
ten
settings
under
a
given
problem
in
order
without
interruption
if
for
any
reason
the
series
of
observations
had
to
be
interrupted
it
was
resumed
at
the
same
point
subsequently
occasionally
it
was
found
desirable
or
necessary
to
present
only
five
of
the
series
of
ten
settings
in
succession
and
then
to
interrupt
observations
for
an
interval
of
a
few
minutes
or
even
several
hours
but
as
a
rule
it
was
possible
to
present
the
series
of
ten
settings
all
things
being
considered
it
proved
more
satisfactory
to
give
only
ten
trials
a
day
to
each
subject
frequently
twenty
and
rarely
thirty
trials
were
given
on
the
same
day
in
such
cases
the
series
of
settings
was
simply
repeated
the
only
pause
between
trials
was
that
necessary
for
resetting
the
entrance
doors
and
replenishing
the
food
which
served
as
a
reward
for
success

at
the

systematic
work
with
the
apparatus
and
method
described
in
the
previous
section
was
undertaken
early
in
april
with
skirrl
sobke
and
julius
the
results
for
each
of
them
are
now
to
be
presented
with
such
measure
of
detail
as
their
importance
seems
to
justify
skirrl
had
previously
been
used
by
doctor
hamilton
in
an
experimental
study
of
reactive
tendencies
he
proved
so
remarkably
inefficient
in
the
work
that
doctor
hamilton
was
led
to
characterize
him
as
and
to
recommend
him
to
me
for
further
study
because
of
his
mental
peculiarities
with
me
he
was
from
the
first
frank
aggressive
and
inclined
to
be
savage
it
was
soon
possible
for
me
to
go
into
the
large
cage
z
with
him
and
allow
him
to
take
food
from
my
hand
he
was
without
fear
of
the
experimental
apparatus
and
it
proved
relatively
easy
to
accustom
him
to
the
routine
of
the
experiment
throughout
the
work
he
was
rather
slow
inattentive
and
erratic
beginning
on
april
i
sought
to
acquaint
him
with
the
apparatus
by
allowing
him
to
make
trips
through
the
several
boxes
with
the
reward
of
food
each
time
thus
for
example
with
the
entrance
and
exit
doors
of
box
raised
the
monkey
was
allowed
to
pass
into
the
e
and
thence
through
box
to
the
food
cup
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
eating
he
was
called
back
to
d
by
the
experimenter
and
after
a
few
seconds
allowed
similarly
to
make
a
trip
by
way
of
one
of
the
other
boxes
by
reason
of
this
preliminary
training
he
soon
came
to
seek
eagerly
for
the
reward
of
food
on
april
the
apparatus
was
painted
white
in
order
to
increase
the
lightness
and
thus
render
it
easier
for
the
experimenter
to
observe
the
animal
movements
and
when
on
april
skirrl
was
again
introduced
to
it
for
further
preliminary
training
he
utterly
refused
to
enter
the
boxes
giving
every
indication
of
extreme
fear
of
the
white
floors
and
even
of
the
sides
of
the
boxes
finally
the
attempts
to
induce
him
to
enter
the
boxes
had
to
be
given
up
and
he
was
returned
to
his
cage
unfed
the
following
day
i
was
equally
unsuccessful
in
either
driving
or
tempting
him
with
food
into
the
apparatus
but
on
april
he
was
so
hungry
that
he
was
finally
lured
in
by
the
use
of
food
he
cautiously
approached
the
boxes
and
attempted
to
climb
through
on
the
sides
instead
of
walking
on
the
floor
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
he
had
an
instinctive
or
an
acquired
fear
of
the
white
surfaces
as
the
matter
was
of
prime
importance
for
the
success
of
my
work
i
inquired
of
doctor
hamilton
and
of
the
men
in
charge
of
the
cages
for
any
incident
which
might
account
for
this
peculiar
behavior
and
i
learned
that
some
three
months
earlier
while
the
animal
cages
were
being
whitewashed
skirrl
had
jumped
at
one
of
the
laborers
who
was
applying
a
brush
to
the
framework
of
one
of
the
cages
and
had
shaken
some
lime
into
his
eyes
he
was
greatly
frightened
and
enraged
evidently
he
experienced
extreme
discomfort
if
not
acute
pain
and
there
resulted
an
association
with
whiteness
which
was
quite
sufficient
to
cause
him
to
avoid
the
freshly
painted
apparatus
having
obtained
an
adequate
explanation
of
this
monkey
peculiar
behavior
i
proceeded
with
my
efforts
to
induce
him
to
work
smoothly
and
rapidly
and
on
april
by
covering
the
floor
with
sawdust
i
so
diminished
the
influence
of
the
whiteness
as
to
render
the
preliminary
training
fairly
satisfactory
at
the
end
of
two
more
days
everything
was
going
so
well
that
it
seemed
desirable
to
begin
the
regular
experiment
on
the
morning
of
april
skirrl
was
introduced
to
the
apparatus
and
given
his
first
series
of
ten
trials
on
problem
this
problem
demanded
the
selection
of
the
first
door
at
the
left
in
any
group
of
open
doors
the
procedure
was
as
previously
described
in
that
the
experimenter
raised
the
entrance
doors
of
a
certain
group
of
boxes
admitted
the
animal
to
the
punished
incorrect
choices
by
confining
the
animal
for
thirty
seconds
and
rewarded
correct
choices
by
raising
the
exit
door
and
thus
permitting
escape
and
the
obtaining
of
food
the
trials
were
given
in
rapid
succession
and
the
total
time
required
for
this
first
series
of
ten
trials
was
minutes
skirrl
worked
faithfully
throughout
this
interval
and
exhibited
no
marked
discouragement
when
confined
in
a
box
he
showed
uneasiness
and
dissatisfaction
by
moving
about
constantly
shaking
the
doors
and
trying
to
raise
them
in
order
to
escape
for
the
series
of
settings
used
in
connection
with
problem
the
reader
is
referred
to

in
the
first

numbered
and
were
opened
as
it
happened
the
animal
when
admitted
to

having
received
the
reward
of
food
he
was
called
back
to

and
doors
and
having
been
raised
in
preparation
for
the
next
trial
he
was
again
admitted
to
the
this
time
he
quickly
chose
box
and
was
confined
therein
for
thirty
seconds
on
being
released
he
chose
after
an
interval
of
four
minutes
box
thus
completing
the
trial
as
it
is
highly
important
not
only
in
connection
with
the
present
description
of
behavior
but
also
for
subsequent

of
the
reactions
of
different
types
of

in

the
detailed

for

so
on

thus
for
instance
in

of

to
the
animal
in

so
on
to
it
is
clear
from

that
no

improvement
occurred
but
oddly
enough
in

almost

that

to

while

proportional
to

in

during
the

on
this
problem
skirrl
improved
markedly
his
performance
was
somewhat
irregular
and
unpredictable
but
on
the
whole
the
experiment
seemed
fairly
satisfactory
cold
cloudy
or
rainy
days
tended
to
diminish
steadiness
and
to
increase
the
number
of
mistakes
similarly
absence
of
hunger
was
unfavorable
to
continuous
effort
to
find
the
right
box
the
period
of
confinement
as
punishment
for
wrong
choices
was
increased
from
thirty
seconds
to
sixty
seconds
on
april
but
there
is
no
satisfactory
evidence
that
this
favored
the
solution
of
the
problem
work
on
may
was
interrupted
by
a
severe
storm
the
noise
of
which
so
distracted
the
monkey
that
he
ceased
to
work
consequently
observations
were
interrupted
on
the
completion
of
trial
and
on
may
the
series
was
begun
with
setting
on
this
date
eighteen
trials
were
given
in
succession
and
in
only
one
of
them
did
a
mistake
occur
since
the
ten
trials
numbered
to
were
correct
skirrl
was
considered
to
have
solved
problem
and
systematic
training
was
discontinued
on
the
following
day
as
a
measure
of
the
extent
to
which
the
animal
had
learned
to
select
the
first
door
at
the
left
no
matter
what
its
position
or
the
number
of
doors
in
the
group
presented
a
control
series
was
given
in
which
the
settings
differed
from
the
regular
series
of
settings
these
supplementary
settings
are
presented
at
the
bottom
of
table
together
with
the
records
of
reaction
in
ten
trials
since
in
only
six
of
these
ten
control
settings
was
the
first
choice
correct
it
is
scarcely
fair
to
insist
that
the
animal
was
reacting
on
the
basis
of
an
ideational
solution
of
the
problem
rather
it
would
seem
that
he
had
learned
to
react
to
particular
settings
a
careful
study
of
all
of
the
data
of
response
together
with
notes
on
the
varied
behavior
of
the
animal
during
the
experiments
justifies
the
statement
that
skirrl
solution
of
problem
was
incomplete
and
unreliable
it
was
highly
dependent
upon
the
particular
situation
or
even
the
particular
door
at
the
left
end
of
the
group
and
slightly
if
at
all
dependent
upon
anything
comparable
to
the
human
idea
of
first
at
the
left
of
the
group
this
particular
series
of
observations
has
been
described
and
discussed
in
some
detail
in
order
to
make
the
chief
points
of
method
clear
it
will
be
needless
hereafter
to
refer
explicitly
to
many
of
the
characteristics
of
reaction
or
to
the
important
points
in
the
construction
of
tables
which
have
been
mentioned
a
graphic
representation
of
skirrl
learning
process
in
problem
is
presented
in
figure
the
irregularities
are
most
striking
and
fairly
indicate
the
erraticness
of
the
animal
the
curve
is
based
upon
the
data
in
next
to
the
last
column
of
table
that
is
the
column
presenting
the
errors
or
wrong
first
choices
in
each
series
of
trials
unquestionably
the
form
of
such
a
curve
of
learning
should
be
considered
in
connection
with
the
method
or
methods
of
selecting
the
right
box
employed
by
the
animal
during
the
course
of
experimentation
it
appears
from
an
analysis
of
the
behavior
of
skirrl
in
problem
that
there
developed
a
single
definite
and
persistent
method
namely
that
of
going
to
one
box
in
the
group
and
in
case
it
happened
to
be
a
wrong
one
of
choosing
on
emergence
from
it
the
next
toward
the
right
end
of
the
group
and
so
on
down
the
line
having
reached
the
extreme
right
end
the
tendency
was
to
follow
the
side
of
the
around
to
the
opposite
end
and
to
enter
the
first
box
at
the
left
end
of
the
group
which
was
of
course
the
right
one
this
method
appears
with
certain
slight
variations
in
approximately
ninety
per
cent
of
the
trials
which
involved
incorrect
choices
thus
in
the
case
of
trials
to
of
which
eight
exhibit
right
first
choices
the
remaining
two
exhibit
the
method
described
above
except
that
the
final
member
at
the
right
end
of
the
group
was
in
each
case

first

at

end
on
the
whole
skirrl
behavior
in
connection
with
this
problem
appears
to
indicate
a
low
order
of
intelligence
he
persisted
in
such
stupid
acts
as
that
of
turning
after
emergence
from
the
right
box
toward
the
right
and
passing
into
the
blind
alley
i
instead
of
toward
the
left
through
g
and
h
to
in
contrast
with
the
other
animals
he
spent
much
time
before
the
closed
doors
of
the
boxes
instead
of
going
directly
to
the
open
doors
some
one
of
which
marked
the
box
in
which
the
reward
of
food
could
be
obtained
it
is
moreover
obvious
that
his
responses
as
they
appear
in
table
are
extremely
different
from
those
of
a
human
being
who
is
capable
of
bringing
the
idea
of
first
at
the
left
end
to
bear
upon
the
problem
in
question
second
from
the
right
following
the
series
of
control
trials
of
problem
given
to
skirrl
on
may
a
period
of
four
days
was
allowed
during
which
the
animal
was
merely
fed
in
the
boxes
each
day
this
was
done
in
order
that
he
should
partially
lose
the
effects
of
his
previous
training
to
choose
the
first
box
at
the
left
before
being
presented
with
the
second
problem
the
second
box
from
the
right
on
may
regular
experimentation
was
begun
with
problem
naturally
the
situation
presented
unusual
difficulties
to
the
monkey
because
of
his
previously
acquired
habit
and
on
the
first
day
it
was
possible
to
give
only
five
trials
in
all
except
the
first
of
which
skirrl
had
to
be
aided
by
the
experimenter
to
find
the
right
box
he
persistently
as
appears
in
the
first
line
of
records
of
table
entered
the
first
box
at
the
left
the
series
was
continued
on
may
but
with
very
unsatisfactory
results
since
he
apparently
had
been
greatly
discouraged
by
the
unusual
difficulties
previously
met
only
four
trials
could
be
given
and
in
these
the
showing
made
was
very
poor
it
is
noteworthy
however
that
in
trials
and
may
there
was
no
marked
tendency
to
choose
the
first
box
at
the
left
thus
quickly
had
the
force
of
the
previous
habit
been
broken
for
problem
the
total
number
of
open
doors
in
the
ten
settings
is
fifty
as
appears
from
the
data
on
page
and
as
ten
of
these
fifty
open
doors
may
be
defined
as
right
ones
the
expected
ratio
of
right
to
wrong
first
choices
in
the
absence
of
previous
training
is
to
the
actual
ratio
for
the
first

given

is
to
while
in
the
second
series
it
is
to
on
the
morning
of
may
work
was
interrupted
in
the
ninth
trial
by
what
seemed
at
the
moment
a
peculiarly
unfortunate
accident
but
in
the
light
of
later
developments
an
incident
most
fruitful
of
valuable
results
skirrl
in
trial
directly
entered
box
since
this
was
not
the
right
box
he
was
punished
by
being
confined
in
it
for
ten
seconds
while
in
the
box
he
howled
and
when
the
entrance
door
was
raised
for
him
to
retrace
his
steps
he
came
out
with
a
rush
showing
extreme
excitement
and
either
rage
or
fear
i
could
not
be
sure
which
at
intervals
he
uttered
loud
cries
which
i
am
now
able
to
identify
as
cries
of
alarm
repeatedly
he
went
to
the
open
door
of
box
and
peered
in
or
peered
down
through
the
hole
in
the
floor
which
received
the
staple
on
the
door
he
refused
to
enter
any
one
of
the
open
boxes
and
continued
at
intervals
of
every
half
minute
or
so
his
cries
for
thirty
minutes
i
waited
hoping
to
be
able
to
induce
him
to
complete
the
series
of
trials
but
in
vain
although
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
eager
to
escape
from
the
apparatus
he
would
not
enter
any
of
the
boxes
even
when
the
exit
doors
were
raised
instead
he
gnawed
at
the
door
in
fig
to
the
alleyway
d
and
attempted
to
force
his
way
through
instead
of
taking
the
easy
and
clear
route
to
the
alleys
through
one
of
the
boxes
his
behavior
was
most
surprising
and
puzzling
finally
i
gave
up
the
attempt
to
complete
the
series
and
returned
him
to
his
cage
by
way
of
the
entrance
door
to
the
i
then
entered
the
apparatus
to
seek
some
explanation
of
the
behavior
and
my
search
was
rewarded
by
the
finding
of
two
sharp
pointed
nails
which
protruded
for
an
inch
or
more
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
of
box
my
assistant
who
had
been
charged
with
the
task
of
installing
the
locks
for
the
several
doors
had
used
nails
instead
of
screws
for
attaching
staples
underneath
the
floor
and
had
neglected
to
clinch
the
nails
skirrl
in
the
dim
light
of
the
box
doubtless
stepped
upon
one
of
the
nails
and
inflicted
a
painful
although
not
serious
injury
upon
himself
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
see
clearly
the
source
of
his
injury
he
was
greatly
frightened
and
expressed
the
emotion
most
vigorously
his
behavior
strongly
suggested
a
superstitious
dread
of
some
unseen
danger
it
may
be
that
the
instinctive
fear
of
snakes
so
strong
in
monkeys
was
partly
responsible
for
his
response
the
first
result
of
this
accident
was
that
more
than
two
weeks
were
lost
for
it
was
impossible
during
the
next
few
days
to
induce
the
animal
to
enter
any
of
the
boxes
voluntarily
from
may
to
may
i
labored
daily
to
overcome
his
newly
acquired
fear
the
usual
procedure
was
to
coax
him
through
one
box
after
another
by
standing
at
the
exit
door
with
some
tempting
morsel
of
food
after
several
days
of
this
treatment
he
again
trusted
himself
to
the
boxes
although
very
circumspectly
and
only
when
both
entrance
and
exit
doors
were
raised
not
until
may
was
it
possible
to
resume
regular
experimentation
and
on
that
day
it
was
found
necessary
to
indicate
the
right
box
by
raising
the
exit
door
slightly
and
then
immediately
lowering
it
trials
in
which
this
form
of
aid
was
given
are
indicated
in
table
by
a
star
following
the
last
choice
gradually
skirrl
regained
his
confidence
in
the
apparatus
and
began
to
work
more
naturally
for
a
long
time
he
would
not
stand
punishment
and
it
was
necessary
for
the
experimenter
to
be
very
careful
in
locking
the
doors
since
the
sound
of
the
bar
sliding
beneath
the
floor
often
frightened
and
caused
him
to
quit
work
day
after
day
the
tendency
to
peer
through
the
holes
in
the
floor
at
the
entrance
to
the
boxes
rendered
it
clear
that
the
animal
feared
some
danger
from
beneath
the
floor
this
behavior
was
so
persistent
that
much
time
was
wasted
in
the
experiments
on
the
last
day
of
may
punishment
by
confinement
for
ten
seconds
in
wrong
boxes
was
introduced
but
since
this
tended
to
discourage
the
monkey
there
was
substituted
for
it
on
june
the
punishment
of
forcing
him
to
work
his
way
out
of
each
wrong
box
by
raising
the
entrance
door
which
had
been
closed
behind
him
this
he
could
fairly
readily
do
and
his
stay
in
a
box
rarely
measured
more
than
ten
seconds
as
a
variation
in
the
mode
of
procedure
confinement
for
thirty
seconds
was
tried
on
june
but
it
worked
unsatisfactorily
and
had
to
be
abandoned
during
this
series
the
animal
was
startled
by
the
sound
from
one
of
the
sliding
bars
under
the
floor
and
in
the
sixth
trial
he
refused
to
work
as
improvement
was
very
slow
varied
modes
of
rewarding
and
punishing
the
animal
were
tried
in
the
hope
of
discovering
a
means
of
facilitating
the
work
among
the
former
are
the
use
of
banana
grapes
peanuts
and
other
eagerly
sought
foods
in
varying
quantities
and
in
the
latter
are
included
periods
of
confinement
ranging
from
ten
seconds
to
sixty
seconds
in
the
end
confinement
of
about
thirty
seconds
combined
with
a
small
quantity
of
food
which
was
much
to
the
monkey
taste
gave
most
favorable
results
all
this
time
skirrl
attention
to
the
task
in
hand
was
seldom
good
he
was
easily
diverted
and
even
when
extremely
hungry
often
stopped
work
in
the
middle
of
an
early
trial
yawned
repeatedly
and
finally
sat
down
to
wait
for
release
from
the
apparatus
the
results
obtained
during
the
long
continued
trials
with
this
animal
in
problem
are
presented
in
table
which
differs
from
the
previously
described
table
first
in
that
several
of
the
trials
are

an
asterisk

that
aid
was
given
by
the
experimenter
and
second
in

two
additional
columns
headed
respectively
r
and
w
are
presented
these
give
the
right
and

first
choices
for
each
day
whereas
the
two
columns
preceding
them
give
the
same
data
for
each

of

similarly
the

of

is
presented
for
each

in
table
instead
of
for
each
series
of
ten
trials
as
in
table
from
the
results
of
table
several
peculiarly
interesting
facts
appear
in
the
first
place
the
influence
of
the
habit
of
choosing
the
first
box
at
the
left
disappears
with
surprising
suddenness
and
in
the
second
place
there
are
remarkable
contrasts
in
the
results
for
different
settings
as
they
appear
in
their
respective
vertical
columns
thus
in
the
case
of
setting
after
the
first
trial
mistakes
became
relatively
infrequent
whereas
in
setting
which
involved
the
same
number
of
doors
mistakes
continued
to
be
the
rule
until
nearly
a
thousand
trials
had
been
given
the
most
likely
explanation
of
this
difference
is
that
for
some
reason
the
animal
avoided
box
the
or
better
the
of
which
manifested
themselves

this
method
of

although

proved
remarkably
persistent
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
it
had
been
wholly
overcome
at
the
conclusion
of
the
experiment
in
the
case
of
the
series

or

of

right

throughout
the

with
this
problem
the
end
boxes
numbers
and
were
avoided
this
is
at
least
partially
explained
by
the
fact
that
they
never
existed
and
obviously
never
could
appear
in
problem
as
right
boxes
in
trials
to
given
on
july
there
occurred
partial
return
to
the
formerly
established
method
of
choosing
the
first
door
at
the
right
this
relapse
was
characteristic
of
what
happened
during
the
many
days
which
intervened
between
the
definite
appearance
of
this
habit
and
the
final
solution
of
the
problem
especially
in
connection
with
such
relapses
skirrl
showed
extreme
fatigue
or
ennui
and
often
would
refuse
to
work
and
simply
sit
before
the
open
doors
yawning
this
happened
even
when
he
was
extremely
hungry
and
evidently
eager
enough
for
food
from
july
on
the
hunger
motive
was
increased
by
feeding
the
monkey
only
in
the
apparatus
and
by
so
regulating
the
amount
of
food
given
in
each
trial
that
he
should
obtain
barely
enough
to
keep
him
in
good
physical
condition
an
increase
in
the
number
of
correct
choices
promptly
resulted
and
continued
until
on
july
the
ratio
of
choices
was
to
it
appeared
from
these
data
that
a
relatively
small
number
of
choices
say
not
more
than
ten
a
day
the
rewards
in
connection
with
which
supplied
the
only
food
received
by
the
animal
yielded
most
favorable
results
on
july
the
period
of
confinement
in
wrong
boxes
was
increased
to
sixty
seconds
and
it
was
so
continued
for
a
number
of
days
but
in
the
end
it
became
clear
that
the
period
of
thirty
seconds
combined
with
a
liberal
reward
in
the
shape
of
desired
food
and
a
single
series
of
ten
trials
per
day
was
most
satisfactory
the
detailed
data
of
table
indicate
that
at
this
time
skirrl
was
making
his
choices
by
memory
of
the
particular
setting
skirrl
on
july
was
evidently
hungry
and
eager
to
locate
food
but
seemingly
unable
to
select
the
right
box
in
trial
of
the
series
he
was
punished
by
confinement
in
box
when
the
doors
were
unlocked
in
order
that
the
entrance
door
might
be
raised
to
release
him
the
sliding
under
the
floor
made
a
slight
grating
noise
and
the
instant
the
entrance
door
was
opened
he
jumped
out
excitedly
made
no
outcry
but
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
box
sat
down
and
taking
up
his
right
hind
foot
examined
it
for
a
few
having
apparently
assured
himself
that
nothing
serious
had
happened
he
went
on
unconcernedly
about
his
task
the
presumption
is
that
the
sound
of
the
associated
as
it
was
with
his
painful
experience
in
box
revived
the
strongly
affective
experience
of
stepping
on
the
nail
psychologically
described
the
sound
induced
an
imaginal
complex
equivalent
to
the
earlier
painful
experience
the
behavior
seems
to
the
writer
a
most
important
bit
of
evidence
of
imagery
in
the
monkey
finally
on
august
after
ten
hundred
and
seventy
trials
skirrl
succeeded
in
choosing
correctly
in
the
ten
trials
of
a
series
and
he
was
therefore
considered
to
have
solved
the
problem
of
the
second
door
from
the
right
end
of
the
group
on
the
following
day
he
was
given
a
control
series
with
the
settings
which
are
presented
on
page
and
also
at
the
bottom
of
table
in
this
series
he
chose
correctly
five
times
in
other
words
as
often
correctly
as
incorrectly
an
analysis
of
the
choices
indicates
however
that
two
of
the
five
correct
choices
were
made
in
box
which
as
it
happened
had
proved
a
peculiarly
easy
one
for
him
throughout
the
training
since
from
the
first
he
tended
to
avoid
door
consequently
it
is
only
fair
to
conclude
from
the
results
for
this
control
series
and
for
those
given
on
august
and
that
the
animal
chose
not
on
the
basis
of
anything
remotely
resembling
a
general
idea
of
secondness
from
the
right
end
but
instead
on
the
basis
of
gradually
acquired
modes
of
reaction
to
the
particular
settings
this
conclusion
is
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
he
had
failed
to
learn
to
react
appropriately
and
readily
to
most
of
the
settings
of
the
regular
series
the
curve
which
represents
the
course
of
the
learning
process
in
this
problem
is
presented
in
figure
for
this
and
all
other
curves
which
involve
more
than
a
single
series
of
observations
a
day
the
method
of
construction
was
as
follows
the
first
series
for
each
day
of
training
is
indicated
on
the
curve
by
a
dot
while
the
second
or
third
series
on
a
given
day
although
space
is
allowed
for
them
are
not
so
indicated
consequently
the
form
of
the
curve
is
determined
chiefly
by
the
first
series
per
day
the
extreme
irregularities
of
this
curve
are
most
interesting
and
puzzling
as
are
also
the
variations
in
the
daily
ratios
of
right
to
wrong
first
choices
three
times
in
the
course
of
the
training
this
ratio
rose
to
to
or
higher
the
causes
for
such
extreme
variations
are
not
easily
enumerated
but
a
few
of
the
most
obvious
contributory
causes
are
variations
in
the
weather
especially
cloudiness
or
fogginess
which
rendered
the
apparatus
dark
variations
in
the
degree
of
hunger
or
eagerness
for
food
differences
in
the
activities
of
the
animals
in
the
cages
outside
of
the
laboratory
sometimes
they
were
noisy
and
distracted
the
subject
and
finally
differences
in
the
physical
fitness
and
attitude
of
the
animal
from
day
to
day
the
more
or
less
incidental
behavior
in
connection
with
this
experiment
more
strongly
than
the
statistical
results
of
the
work
on
problem
indicate
the
existence
of
imagery
that
ideas
played
a
part
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
is
probable
but
at
best
they
functioned
very
ineffectively
the
small
number
of
methods
used
in
the
selection
of
the
right
box
and
the
slight
variations
from
the
chief
method
that
of
choosing
the
first
box
at
the
right
end

then
the

in

by
being

labor
which
was
harder
by
far
apparently
than

because
it
demanded
of

certain
mental
processes
which
were
either
lacking
or
but
imperfectly
functional
the
difficultness
of

daily
tasks

to
be

to

but
brief
analysis
and
comment
the
expected
ratio
of
one
right
to
four
wrong
choices
per
series
appears
see
table
for
the
first
series
of
trials
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
skirrl
had
been
trained
for
several
weeks
to
choose
the
second
door
from
the
right
one
would
ordinarily
have
predicted
a
much
larger
number
of
incorrect
choices
the
right
choices
were
due
to
the
monkey
strong
tendency
to
go
first
to
the
first
door
at
the
right
and
thence
to
the
one
next
to
it
indeed
in
the
series
given
on
august
this
method
was
followed
without
variation
in
other
words
in
every
one
of
the
ten
trials

aided
by
experimenter
sobke
first
at
the
left
sobke
was
somewhat
afraid
of
the
experimenter
when
the
investigation
was
undertaken
and
instead
of
willingly
coming
out
of
his
cage
when
the
door
was
raised
he
often
had
to
be
coaxed
out
and
lured
into
the
apparatus
with
food
whereas
skirrl
was
frank
and
rather
aggressive
sobke
was
stealthy
in
his
movements
furtive
and
evidently
suspicious
of
the
experimenter
as
well
as
of
the
apparatus
he
was
perfectly
safe
to
approach
but
would
not
permit
anyone
to
touch
him
after
a
few
days
he
began
to
take
food
from
the
hands
of
the
experimenter
preliminary
work
to
acquaint
this
monkey
with
the
routine
of
the
experiment
was
begun
on
april
as
in
the
case
of
skirrl
he
was
lured
into
the
apparatus
and
was
taught
the
route
through
the
boxes
to
the
starting
point
by
being
allowed
to
obtain
food
once
each
day
in
each
of
the
nine
boxes
the
procedure
was
simple
the
entrance
door
and
the
exit
door
of
a
particular
box
were
raised
and
the
animal
admitted
to
the
and
permitted
to
pass
through
the
box
whose
doors
stood
open
take
its
food
and
return
to
the
starting
point
sobke
very
quickly
learned
the
route
perfectly
and
came
to
work
steadily
and
rapidly
after
five
days
of
preliminary
work
of
this
sort
he
was
so
thoroughly
accustomed
to
the
apparatus
that
it
was
evidently
desirable
to
begin
with
regular
training
experiments
the
first
series
of
trials
was
given
on
april
both
punishment
and
reward
were
employed
from
the
first
the
punishment
consisted
of
confinement
for
thirty
seconds
in
each
wrong
box
and
the
reward
of
a
small
piece
of
banana
usually
not
more
than
a
tenth
of
a
medium
sized
banana
for
each
correct
choice
the
total
time
for
the
first
series
of
trials
was
fourteen
minutes
this
indicates
that
sobke
worked
rapidly
my
notes
record
that
he
worked
quickly
though
shyly
wasted
almost
no
time
made
few
errors
of
choice
and
waited
quietly
during
confinement
in
the
boxes
in
this
also
he
differed
radically
from
skirrl
who
was
restless
and
always
tried
to
escape
from
confinement
throughout
the
work
on
problem
punishment
and
reward
were
kept
constant
everything
progressed
smoothly
there
were
no
such
irregularities
of
behavior
as
appeared
in
the
case
of
skirrl
and
consequently
the
description
of
results
is
a
relatively
simple
matter
sobke
invariably
chose
the
end
boxes
his
performance
was
in
every
way
superior
to
that
of
skirrl
as
previously
the
detailed
results
are
presented
in
tabular
form
table
from
this
table
it
appears
that
whereas
the
expected
ratio
of
right
to
wrong
first
choices
for
this
problem
is
to
the
actual
ratio
for
sobke
first
series
was
to
this
surprisingly
good
showing
is
unquestionably
due
to
his
marked
tendency
to
choose
the
end
box
of
a
group
and
this
tendency
in
turn
may
in
part
be
the
result
of
the
preliminary
training
for
during
that
only
one
box
was
open
each
time
but
if
the
preliminary
training
were
responsible
for
sobke
tendency
it
should
be
noted
that
it
had
very
different
effect
upon
skirrl
and
as
will
be
seen
later
upon
julius
the
results
for
the
ten
different
settings
of
the
doors
for
problem
as
they
appear
in
table
are
of
interest
for
a
number
of
reasons
in
the
first
place
the
setting
appearing
twice
at
the
beginning
of
the
series
and
again
at
the
end
yielded
markedly
different
results
in
the
two
positions
for
whereas
no
mistakes
were
made
in
the
case
of
setting
there
were
fifty
per
cent
of
incorrect
first
choices
for
setting
again
satisfactory
explanation
is
impossible
it
is
conceivable
that
fatigue
or
approaching
satiety
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
failures
at
the
end
of
the
series
but
as
a
rule
as
is
indicated
by
settings
and
if
correct
choices
were
made
at
the
beginning
they
continued
throughout
the
day
work
in
this
problem
sobke
improvement
was
steady
and
fairly
rapid
and
in
the
eighth
series
trials
to
only
correct
first
choices
appear
consequently
seventy
trials
were
required
for
the
solution
of
the
problem
this
number
is
in
marked
contrast
with
skirrl
one
hundred
and
trials
immediately
following
the
first
perfect
series
sobke
was
given
two
series
of
control
tests
on
april
conditions
were
unfavorable
since
the
day
was
stormy
and
the
rain
pattering
on
the
roof
made
a
great
din
nevertheless
he
worked
steadily
and
well
up
to
the
sixth
trial
which
was
preceded
by
a
slight
delay
because
of
the
necessity
of
refilling
some
of
the
food
boxes
after
this
interruption
wrong
choices
occurred
in
trial
and
again
after
trial
there
was
brief
interruption
followed
by
wrong
choices
in
trial
the

to

for

from

of

it

that
sobke
solution

is
reasonably
adequate
he
is
easily
diverted
or
disturbed
in
his
work
by
any
unusual
circumstances
but
so
long
as
everything
goes
smoothly
he
chooses
with
ease
and
certainty
whether
it
is
fair
to
describe
the
behavior
as
involving
an
idea
of
the
relation
of

to
the
other

would
be

or
inadequate

it
is
perfectly
evident
that
sobke
is
much
more
intelligent
than
skirrl
in
practically
every
respect
he
adapted
himself
more
quickly
to
the
experimental
procedure
and
progressed
more
steadily
toward
the
solution
of
the
problem
than
did
skirrl
the
contrast
in
the
learning
processes
of
the
two
monkeys
could
scarcely
be
better
exhibited
than
by
the
curves
of
learning
which
are
presented
in

the
first
that
for
sobke
is
surprisingly
regular
the
second
that
for
skirrl
is
quite
as
surprisingly
irregular
these
results
correlate
perfectly
with
the
steadiness
and
predictability
of
the
former
responses
and
the
irregularity
and
erraticness
of
the
latter
second
from
the
right
on
the
completion
of
problem
sobke
was
in
perfect
condition
as
to
health
and
training
for
experimental
work
he
had
come
to
work
quietly
fairly
deliberately
and
very
steadily
his
timidity
had
diminished
and
he
would
readily
come
to
the
experimenter
for
food
although
still
he
was
somewhat
distrustful
at
times
and
became
timid
when
anything
unusual
occurred
in
the
apparatus
as
preparation
for
problem
a
break
in
regular
experimentation
covering
four
days
followed
the
control
series
of
problem
on
each
of
these
four
days
the
monkey
was
allowed
to
get
food
once
from
each
of
the
nine
boxes
both
doors
of
a
given
box
being
open
for
the
trial
and
all
other
doors
closed
for
this
feeding
experiment
the
doors
were
opened
in
irregular
order
and
this
order
was
changed
from
day
to
day
systematic
work
with
problem
began
on
may
with
punishment
of
thirty
seconds
for
mistakes
and
a
liberal
reward
of
food
for
each
success
early
in
the
series
of
trials
it
was
discovered
that
sobke
was
likely
to
become
discouraged
and
waste
a
great
deal
of
time
unless
certain
aid
were
given
by
the
experimenter
on
this
account
after
the
first
two
trials
the
method
was
adopted
of
punishing
the
animal
by
confinement
for
the
first
ten
mistakes
in
a
trial
and
of
then
if
need
be
indicating
the
right
box
by
slightly
and
momentarily
raising
the
exit
door
every
trial
in
which
aid
was
thus
given
by
the
experimenter
is
indicated
in
table
by
an
asterisk
following
the
last
choice
in
the
first
series
of
trials
for
this
problem
aid
had
to
be
given
in
seven
of
the
ten
trials
and
even
so
the
series
occupied
minutes
it
is
possible
that
had
no
aid
been
given
the
work
might
have
been
continued
successfully
with
a
smaller
number
of
trials
than
ten
per
day
but
under
the
circumstances
it
seemed
wiser
to
avoid
the
risk
of
discouraging
and
thus
spoiling
the
animal
for
use
in
the
experiment
it
should
be
stated
also
that
it
proved
impossible
to
adhere
to
the
period
of
thirty
seconds
as
punishment
in
this
series
for
the
majority
of
the
wrong
choices
confinement
of
not
more
than
ten
seconds
was
used
for
the
second
series
given
on
may
the
conditions
were
unfavorable
in
that
it
was
dark
and
rainy
and
the
noise
of
the
rain
on
the
roof
frightened
sobke
he
refused
to
work
after
the
fourth
trial
and
the
series
had
to
be
completed
on
the
following
day
the
total
time
required
for
this
series
was
minutes
the
work
on
may
was
distinctly
better
and
the
animal
behavior
indicated
in
a
number
of
trials
definite
recognition
of
the
right
door
he
might
for
example
make
a
number
of
incorrect
choices
then
pause
for
a
few
seconds
to
look
steadily
at
the
doors
and
having
apparently
found
some
cue
run
directly
to
the
right
box
no
aid
from
the
experimenter
was
needed
in
this
series
on
the
following
day
improvement
continued
and
the
animal
method
of
choosing
became
definite
and
fairly
precise
he
was
deliberate
quiet
and
extremely
the
time
for
the
series
was
minutes
the
period
of
punishment
was
increased
on
may
to
thirty
seconds
previously
for
the
greater
number
of
the
trials
it
had
been
ten
to
fifteen
seconds
this
increase
apparently
did
not
disturb
the
monkey
for
he
continued
to
work
perfectly
throughout
the
series
although
making
many
mistakes
in
spite
of
deliberate
choices
and
the
refusal
of
certain
boxes
in
each
trial
an
interesting
and
significant
incident
occurred
on
may
when
at
the
conclusion
of
trial
doctor
hamilton
came
into
the
experiment
room
for
a
few
minutes
sobke
immediately
stopped
working
and
he
could
not
be
induced
to
make
any
choices
until
doctor
hamilton
had
left
the
room
this
well
indicates
his
sensitiveness
to
his
surroundings
and
his
inclination
to
timidity
or
nervousness
even
in
the
presence
of
conditions
not
in
themselves
startling
work
was
continued
thus
steadily
until
may
when
because
of
the
failure
of
the
animal
to
improve
it
seemed
wise
to
increase
the
period
of
confinement
as
punishment
to
sixty
seconds
in
the
meantime
it
had
sometimes
been
evident
that
sobke
was
near
to
the
solution
of
his
problem
he
would
often
make
correct
choices
in
three
or
four
trials
in
succession
and
then
apparently
lose
his
cue
and
fail
utterly
for
a
number
of
trials
after
june
in
order
to
hasten
the
solution
of
the
problem
two
series
per
day
were
given
in
some
instances
the
second
series
was
given
almost
immediately
after
the
first
while
in
others
an
interval
of
an
hour
or
more
intervened
it
was
further
found
desirable
to
give
sobke
all
of
his
food
in
the
apparatus
when
the
rewards
obtained
in
the
several
trials
did
not
satisfy
his
hunger
additional
food
was
presented
on
the
completion
of
the
series
of
experiments
in
one
or
more
of
the
food
cups
on
days
marked
by
unwillingness
or
refusal
to
work
very
little
food
was
given
thus
the
eagerness
of
the
monkey
to
locate
the
right
box
was
increased
and
as
a
matter
of
observation
his
deliberateness
and
care
in
choice
increased
correspondingly
sixty
seconds
punishment
was
found
satisfactory
and
it
was
therefore
continued
throughout
the
work
on
this
problem
it
was
evident
on
june
from
the
behavior
of
the
monkey
as
well
as
from
the
score
that
the
perfect
solution
of
the
problem
was
near
at
hand
this
fact
the
experimenter
recorded
in
his
daily
notes
and
sure
enough
on
the
following
day
sobke
chose
correctly
throughout
the
series
of
ten
trials
the
time
for
this
series
was
only
ten
minutes
the
choices
were
made
deliberately
and
readily
an
analysis
of
the
data
of
table
reveals
five
methods
or
reactive
tendencies
which
appeared
more
or
less
definitely
in
the
following
order
a
choice
of
first
box
at
the
left
because
of
experience
in
problem
this
tendency
was
very
quickly
suppressed
by
the
requirements
in
connection
with
problem
indeed
one
of
the
most
significant
differences
which
i
have
discovered
between
the
behavior
of
the
primates
and
that
of
other
mammals
is
the
time
required
for
the
suppression
of
such
an
acquired
tendency
the
monkey
seems
to
learn
almost
immediately
that
it
is
not
worth
while
to
persist
in
a
tendency
which
although
previously
profitable
no
longer
yields
satisfaction
whereas
in
the
crow
pig
rat
and
ring
dove
the
unprofitable
mode
of
response
tends
to
persist
during
a
relatively
large
number
of
trials
b
the
tendency
to
choose
first
a
box
near
the
left
end
of
the
group
to
go
from
that
to
the
box
at
the
extreme
right
end
of
the
group
thence
to
the
one
next
in
order
which
was
of
course
the
right
box
this
tendency
appears
fairly
clearly
from
may
on
c
the
box
at
the
extreme
right
was
first
chosen
and
then
the
one
next
to
it
for
example
in
setting
box
would
be
chosen
first
then
box
or
if
this
did
not
occur
the
method
previously
described
under
b
was
likely
to
be
employed
as
for
example
in
setting
where
such
choices
as
appear
d
in
certain
series
there
appeared
a
marked
preference
for
a
particular
box
usually
box
see
results
for
may
this
was
doubtless
due
in
a
measure
if
not
wholly
to
the
fact
that
box
was
the
right
box
twice
in
each
series
of
ten
settings
but
it
should
be
added
that
the
same
is
true
of

for
which
no
preference
was
manifested

the

there
were

proved
a

and
after
the

the
only

to

was
that
of

the

dark

outside

were
obviously
conditions
of
poor
work

for

a
control

was
given
in
this
sobke
seemed
greatly
surprised
by
the
new
situations
which
presented
themselves
repeatedly
he
exhibited
impulses
to
enter
the
box
which
would
have
been
the
correct
one
in
the
regular
series
of
settings
he
frequently
inhibited
such
impulses
and
chose
correctly
but
at
other
times
he
reacted
quickly
and
made
mistakes
it
was
evident
from
his
behavior
that
he
was
not
guided
by
anything
like
a
definite
idea
of
the
relation
of
the
right
box
to
the
other
members
of
the
group
in
a
second
control
series
given
on
the

june
confusion
appeared
but
less
markedly
for
the

correct

was
made

the

box
was
immediately
chosen
as
should
have
been
the
case
in
the
regular
series
of

sobke
seemed
confused
when
he
emerged
from
this
box
and
had
difficulty
in
locating
the
right
one
then
followed
direct
correct
choices
for

and
for

there
is
recorded
a
deliberately
made
wrong
choice
and
so
on
throughout
the
series
the
choices
being
characterized
by
deliberateness
and
definite
search
for
the
right
box
uncertainty
was
plainly
indicated
and
in
this
the
behavior
of
the
animal
differed
markedly
from
that
in
the
concluding
series
of
the
regular
experiment
it
seems
safe
to
conclude
from
the
results
of
these
control
series
that
sobke
has
no
free
idea
of
the
relation
of
secondness
from
the
right
and
is
chiefly
dependent
upon
memory
of
the
particular
settings
for
cues
which
lead
to
correct
choice
alternately
first
at
left
and
first
at
for
four
successive
days
after
the
last
control
series
in
connection
with
problem
sobke
was
merely
fed
in
the
apparatus
according
to
previous
description
he
exhibited
a
wonderfully
keen
appetite
and
was
well
fed
during
this
interval
between
problems
the
method
of
experimentation
chosen
for
problem
in
the
light
of
previous
experience
was
that
of
confining
the
monkey
for
a
short
time
ten
to
fifteen
seconds
in
the
wrong
box
in
each
of
the
first
ten
mistakes
for
a
given
trial
and
of
then
aiding
him
to
find
the
right
box
by
the
slight
and
momentary
raising
of
the
exit
door
aid
proved
necessary
in
a
few
of
the
trials
during
the
first
four
days
then
he
worked
independently
as
work
progressed
it
was
found
possible
and
also
desirable
to
increase
the
period
of
confinement
and
in
the
end
sixty
seconds
proved
satisfactory
it
was
also
thought
desirable
to
increase
the
number
of
trials
per
day
from
a
single
series
during
the
early
days
to
two
or
even
three
series
from
june
on
often
three
series
could
be
given
in
succession
without
difficulty
during
the
early
trials
on
this
problem
sobke
worked
remarkably
well
but
later
his
willingness
diminished
evidently
because
of
his
failure
readily
to
solve
the
problem
and
it
became
extremely
difficult
to
coax
him
into
the
apparatus
on
days
when
he
entered
only
reluctantly
and
as
it
seemed
against
his
will
he
was
likely
to
be
nervous
erratic
and
often
slow
in
making
his
choices
but
above
all
he
tended
to
waste
time
by
not
returning
to
the
starting
point
preferring
rather
to
loiter
in
the
alleyways

by
sobke
from
the
first
this
problem
promised
to
be
much
easier
for
sobke
than
problem
and
although
the
actual
number
of
trials
necessary
for
the
solution
is
greater
by
sixty
for
problem
than
for
problem
comparison
of
the
data
of
the
tables
justifies
the
statement
that
the
third
problem
was
both
easier
and
more
nearly
adequately
solved
than
the
second
this
is
not
surprising
when
the
nature
of
the
two
problems
is
considered
for
whereas
problem
requires
choice
by
perception
of
the
relationship
of
secondness
from
the
right
end
of
the
group
problem
requires
instead
the
choice
of
the
end
member
of
the
group
each
time
with
the
additional
variation
of
alternation
of
ends
now
as
it
happens
the
end
member
is
easily
selected
by
the
monkey
and
it
appears
further
that
alternation
was
relatively
easy
for
sobke
to
acquire
consequently
the
combination
of
end
and
alternation
proved
easier
than
the
choice
of
the
second
from
the
right
end
of
the
group
the
above
statements
are
supported
by
comparison
of
the
curves
of
learning
the
curve
for
problem
figure
is
extremely
irregular
that
for
problem
figure
much
more
regular
similarly
the
daily
ratios
of
right
to
wrong
choices
as
exhibited
in
tables
and
indicate
smaller
variations
for
the
third
problem
than
for
the
second
sobke
made
ten
correct
first
choices
in
the
third
series
for
july
but
he
was
working
very
uncertainly
and
it
seemed
rather
a
matter
of
good
luck
than
good
management
that
he
succeeded
in
presenting
this
perfect
series
for
this
reason
and
also
because
it
did
not
seem
feasible
to
have
sunday
intervene
between
the
final
and
perfect
regular
series
and
the
control
series
an
additional
regular
series
was
given
on
july
in
which
as
the
table
indicates
a
single
mistake
occurred
in
trial
the
monkey
was
working
perfectly
the
series
of
trials
required
only
ten
minutes
and
it
was
evident
that
carelessness
and
eagerness
to
obtain
food
were
chiefly
responsible
for
the
mistake
the
control
series
given
on
july
immediately
after
the
series
just
described
resulted
similarly
in
one
failure
and
nine
successes
the
choices
were
made
easily
and
with
certainty
and
the
only
mistake
that
of
setting
was
apparently
due
to
carelessness
this
excellent
showing
for
the
control
series
wholly
justifies
the
comparison
of
problems
and
as
to
difficultness
made
above
whereas
in
both
problems
and
the
control
trials
caused
confusion
in
the
case
of
problem
they
did
not
essentially
alter
the
behavior
of
the
animal
the
fact
seems
to
be
that
for
this
problem
the
particular
setting
is
of
relatively
little
importance
while
turning
alternately
to
the
extreme
left
and
the
extreme
right
is
of
prime
importance
that
sobke
had
the
idea
of
alternation
or
of
the
end
box
there
seems
no
more
reason
for
insisting
than
that
he
had
the
idea
of
secondness
from
the
right
end
in
problem
it
is
possible
even
probable
that
these
ideas
existed
rather
vaguely
in
his
consciousness
but
there
is
obviously
no
necessity
for
insisting
that
the
solution
of
the
problems
depended
upon
them
as
the
available
time
for
the
continuation
of
the
experiment
was
limited
it
was
decided
to
proceed
with
work
on
problem
immediately
upon
the
completion
of
problem
and
on
july
the
problem
of
the
middle
door
was
presented
to
sobke
since
it
was
anticipated
that
this
sudden
change
would
confuse
and
discourage
him
greatly
the
only
form
of
punishment
administered
was
the
momentary
lowering
of
the
entrance
door
of
the
wrong
box
as
in
the
previous
problem
he
was
aided
after
ten
successive
wrong
choices
as
might
have
been
anticipated
he
persistently
entered
the
end
boxes
of
the
groups
and
this
in
some
instances
probably
would
have
been
kept
up
for
many
minutes
had
not
the
experimenter
lured
him
into
the
right
box
by
slightly
raising
the
exit
door
in
the
first
series
he
had
to
be
aided
in
five
of
the
ten
trials
the
total
time
for
the
series
was
minutes
the
total
number
of
choices
in
the
second
series
he
was
aided
in
four
of
the
trials
the
total
time
required
was
minutes
and
the
total
number
of
choices
was
throughout
the
first
series
sobke
worked
hard
but
with
evidently
increasing
dissatisfaction
he
clung
persistently
to
his
acquired
tendency
to
choose
the
end
boxes
and
after
each
trial
he
returned
less
willingly
to
the
starting
point
up
to
this
time
his
attitude
toward
the
experimenter
had
been
perfectly
friendly
if
not
wholly
trustful
but
when
on
july
he
was
brought
into
the
apparatus
for
the
second
series
he
exhibited
a
wholly
new
form
of
behavior
for
instead
of
attending
diligently
to
the
open
doors
and
devoting
his
energies
to
trying
to
find
the
right
box
he
instead
after
gazing
at
them
for
a
few
seconds
turned
toward
the
experimenter
and
jumped
for
him
savagely
throwing
himself
against
the
wire
netting
with
great
force
this
was
repeated
a
number
of
times
during
the
first
two
or
three
trials
and
it
occurred
less
frequently
later
in
the
series
since
nothing
unusual
had
happened
outside
of
the
experiment
room
the
suggested
explanation
of
this
sudden
change
in
attitude
and
behavior
is
that
the
monkey
resented
and
blamed
on
the
experimenter
the
difficulty
which
he
was
having
in
obtaining
food
from
this
time
on
until
the
end
of
my
work
sobke
was
always
savage
and
both
in
and
out
of
the
apparatus
he
was
constantly
on
the
watch
for
an
opportunity
to
spring
upon
me
previously
it
had
been
possible
for
me
to
coax
him
into
the
apparatus
by
offering
him
food
and
to
return
him
to
his
cage
by
walking
after
him
but
on
and
after
the
of
july
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
approach
him
without
extreme
risk
of
being
bitten
doctor
hamilton
when
told
of
this
behavior
reported
that
several
times
monkeys
have
shown
resentment
toward
him
when
they
were
having
trouble
in
the
experiment
i
therefore
feel
fairly
confident
that
i
have
not
misinterpreted
sobke
behavior
when
on
july
i
gave
sobke
an
opportunity
to
enter
the
apparatus
he
refused
and
it
was
impossible
to
lure
him
in
with
food
two
hours
later
having
waited
meantime
for
his
breakfast
he
entered
readily
and
worked
steadily
and
persistently
through
his
third
series
of
trials
but
in
no
one
of
these
trials
did
he
choose
correctly
neither
on
this
day
nor
the
following
did
he
exhibit
resentment
while
at
work
he
apparently
had
regained
his
affective
poise
and
was
able
to
attend
as
formerly
to
the
task
of
locating
his
rewards
during
these
first
three
series
although
the
ratio
of
right
to
wrong
choices
stood
to
there
occurred
a
marked
reduction
in
the
number
of
trials
in
which
aid
was
necessary
as
well
as
in
the
total
number
of
choices
and
on
july
correct
reactions
began
to
appear
improvement
during
the
next
hundred
trials
was
steady
and
fairly
rapid
and
on
july
a
record
of
seven
right
to
three
wrong
trials
was
obtained
this
was
surprising
to
the
experimenter
as
well
as
gratifying
since
he
was
eager
to
have
the
animal
complete
this
problem
before
work
should
have
to
be
discontinued
everything
went
smoothly
until
august
when
my
assistant
who
had
been
left
in
charge
of
the
experimental
work
for
a
week
attempted
to
increase
the
number
of
trials
per
day
to
two
series
sobke
apparently
was
not
quite
ready
for
this
increase
in
the
amount
of
his
day
labor
and
refused
to
work
at
the
end
of
the
first
series
in
this
series
he
did
less
well
than
on
the
previous
day
the
following
day
august
unfortunately
and
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
experimenter
the
laboratory
was
painted
and
there
was
necessarily
considerable
disturbance
because
of
the
presence
of
the
workmen
and
in
addition
the
pervasive
odor
of
fresh
paint
sobke
chose
still
less
successfully
on
this
date
and
on
august
he
refused
to
work
after
the
eighth
trial
it
is
true
that
during
these
bad
days
the
total
number
of
choices
steadily
diminished
while
the
successes
also
diminished
or
at
best
failed
to
increase
when
on
august
i
returned
to
the
laboratory
to
take
charge
i
found
that
sobke
was
no
longer
trying
to
solve
the
problem
as
when
i
had
gone
away
his
attitude
had
changed

by
increasing
the

but
my
best
efforts
continuing
up

failed
markedly
to
improve
the
condition
the
number
of

did
somewhat
increase
but
at
no
time
did
the
animal
attain
the
degree
of
success
which
he
had
achieved
as
early
as
july
in
the
eleventh
series
of
trials
during
the
last
two
weeks
of
experimentation
all
possible
efforts
were
put
forth
to
discover
the
best
combination
of

and
punishments
punishment
was
varied
from
to
confinement
of
sixty
seconds
and
many
kinds
of
food
in
different
amounts
were
tried
as
rewards
but
in
spite
of
everything
sobke
failed
to
improve
markedly
from
time
to
time
notably
on
august
and
he
exhibited
peculiarly
strong
resentment
toward
me
and
repeatedly
attempted
to
attack
me
the
outcome
of
my
experiments
with
problem
is
peculiarly
interesting
in
that
it
indicates
the
importance
of
a
favorable
attitude
toward
the
work
and
the
extreme
risk
from
disturbing
or
discouraging
conditions
it
seems
not
improbable
that
had
the
work
progressed
without
change
in
experimenter
or
method
of
procedure
and
above
all
without
the
disturbance
of
the
painting
sobke
might
have
solved
problem
within
a
few
days
this
is
by
no
means
certain
however
for
in
problems
and
the
ratio
of
right
to
wrong
choices
instead
of
increasing
steadily
increased
very
irregularly

this
proved
fairly
easy
when
the

involved
was

setting
was
most
difficult

the

the

was
obviously

whereas
success
in

appeared
early
in

it
failed
to

during

for

and
involving
either
seven

nine

the
direct

april
julius
when
again
introduced
to
it
gave
no
indications
of
fear
uneasiness
or
dislike
but
worked
as
formerly
making
his
round
trips
quickly
and
eagerly
entering
any
box
which
happened
to
be
open
in
order
to
obtain
the
reward
of
food
the
regular
experimentation
was
undertaken
on
april
and
the
results
of
the
first
series
of
trials
with
julius
are
sharply
contrasted
with
those
obtained
with
the
monkeys
in
that
fewer
choices
were
necessary
instead
of
the
expected
ratio
of
right
to
wrong
first
choices
to
the
orang
utan
gave
a
ratio
of
to
an
additional
markedly
different
result
from
that
obtained
with
the
monkeys

the

it
is
also
noteworthy
that
julius
in
the
presence
of
visitors
or
under
other
unusual
conditions
worked
steadily
and
well
whereas
the
monkeys
and
especially
sobke
tended
to
be
distracted
and
often
refused
to
work
at
all
almost
from
the
beginning
of
his
work
on
problem
l
julius
began
to
develop
the
tendency
to
enter
immediately
the
open
door
nearest
the
starting
point
in
case
the
group
of
open
doors
lay
to
the
right
of
the
middle
of
the
apparatus
this
method
naturally
yielded
success
whereas
if
the
group
included
doors
to
the
left
of
the
middle
it
resulted
in
failure
obviously
it
was
a
most
unsatisfactory
method
and
although
it
enabled
him
to
make
more
right
than
wrong
first
choices
it
prevented
him
from
increasing
the
number
of
right
choices
and
as
table
indicates
it
maintained
the
ratio
of
right
to
wrong
first
choices
for
eight
successive
days
on
april
a
break
occurred
in
which
the
number
of
correct
choices
was
reduced
from
six
to
five
julius
worked
very
rapidly
and
with
almost
no
hesitation
in
choosing
my
notes
record
he
seems
to
miss
the
point
wholly
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
punishment
is
sufficiently
severe
at
this
time
he
was
being
punished
by
thirty
seconds
confinement
in
each
wrong
box
the
interval
having
been
held
fairly
steadily
from
the
first
series
of
experiments
on
april
it
was
increased
to
sixty
seconds
in
an
effort
to
break
him
of
the
habit
of
choosing
the
nearest
door
but
he
became
extremely
restless
under
the
longer
confinement
and
tried
his
best
to
raise
the
entrance
and
exit
doors
since
there
was
at
this
time
no
mechanism
for
locking
them
when
closed
it
was
difficult
for
the
experimenter
to
prevent
him
from
escaping
by
way
of
the
entrance
door
or
from
raising
the
exit
door
sufficiently
to
obtain
the
food
indeed
the
longer
confinement
worked
so
unsatisfactorily
that
on
the
following
day
i
substituted
for
it
the
punishment
of
forcing
him
to
raise
the
entrance
door
of
the
wrong
box
in
order
to
escape
for
a
new
choice
he
was
rewarded
with
food
in
the
alleyway
h
beside
door
figure
only
when
he
chose
correctly
on
first
attempt
this
method
discouraged
him
extremely
and
proved
wasteful
of
time
consequently
in
a
second
series
on
the
same
date
return
was
made
to
the
former
method
and
he
was
rewarded
with
food
whenever
he
found
the
right
box
but
on
april
the
two
methods
were
again
employed
the
first
in
the
initial
series
and
the
second
in
a
final
series
of
trials
the
animal
persistent
attempts
to
raise
the
doors
gave
the
experimenter
so
much
trouble
that
on
april
barbed
wire
was
nailed
over
the
windows
of
the
entrance
doors
with
the
hope
that
it
might
prevent
him
from
working
at
them
but
he
quickly
learned
to
place
his
fingers
between
the
barbs
and
raise
the
doors
as
effectively
as
ever
on
april
the
reward
of
food
was
given
only
when
the
first
choice
was
that
of
the
right
box
and
in
that
event
it
was
placed
in
the
alleyway
h
as
stated
above
as
it
seemed
absolutely
essential
to
break
the
unprofitable
habit
of
choosing
the
nearest
door
on
may
a
new
series
of
settings
was
presented
in
which
only
the
doors
to
the
left
of
the
middle
of
the
row
of
nine
boxes
were
used
as
right
doors
that
is
in
this
new
series
doors
to
occur
as
right
doors
to
do
not
as
punishment
for
wrong
choices
on
this
date
julius
was
confined
in
the
wrong
box
from
one
to
five
minutes
it
was
difficult
to
keep
him
in
but
by
means
of
cords
which
had
been
attached
to
the
doors
this
was
successfully
accomplished
yet
another
and
slightly
different
series
of
settings
was
employed
on
may
and
this
proving
satisfactory
was
continued
in
use
until
the
end
of
the
experiment
with
punishment
ranging
from
sixty
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
seconds
for
each
mistake
naturally
the
modification
of
settings
introduced
may
greatly
increased
the
proportion
of
wrong
first
choices
indeed
as
appears
in
table
the
ratio
of
right
to
wrong
immediately
changed
from
to
between
may
and
may
no
steady
and
consistent
improvement
in
method
or
in
the
number
of
correct
first
choices
occurred
and
on
the
last
named
date
julius
chose
correctly
only
three
times
in
his
ten
trials
at
this
time
there
was
as
my
notes
record
no
satisfactory
indication
of
progress
and
the
status
of
the
experiment
seemed
extremely
unsatisfactory
in
as
much
as
in
spite
of
the
best
efforts
to
break
up
the
habit
of
choosing
the
nearest
door
the
orang
utan
still
persisted
to
a
considerable
extent
in
the
use
of
this
method
the
only
encouraging
feature
of
the
results
was
an
evident
tendency
to
choose
somewhat
nearer

greatly
to
the
surprise
of
the
experimenter
for
no
indication
had
previously
appeared
of
this
approaching
solution
of
the
problem
it
seemed
possible
however
that
the
successes
were
accidental
and
it
was
anticipated
that
in
a
control
series
julius
would
again
make
mistakes
but
on
the
following
day
may
the
presentation
of
the
original
series
of
ten
settings
which
of
course
differed
radically
from
the
settings
used
from
may
to
may
was
responded
to
promptly
readily
and
without
a
single
mistake
julius
had
solved
his
problem
suddenly
and
in
all
probability
ideationally
only
three
reactive
tendencies
or
methods
appeared
during
julius
work
on
this
problem
a
choice
of
the
open
door
nearest
to
the
starting
point
sometimes
the
adjacent
boxes
were
entered
b
a
tendency
to
avoid
the
nearest
door
and
select
instead
one
further
toward
the
left
end
of
the
group
c
direct
choice
of
the
first
door
on
the
left
the
curve
of
learning
plotted
from
the
daily
wrong
choices
and
presented
in
figure
had
it
been
obtained
with
a
human
subject
would
undoubtedly
be
described
as
an
ideational
and
possibly
even
as
a
rational
curve
for
its
sudden
drop
from
near
the
maximum
to
the
base
line
strongly
suggests
if
it
does
not
actually
prove
insight
never
before
has
a
curve
of
learning
like
this
been
obtained
from
an
infrahuman
animal
i
feel
wholly
justified
in
concluding
from
the
evidences
at
hand
which
have
been
presented
as
adequately
as
is
possible
without
going
into
minutely
detailed
description
that
the
orang
utan
solved
this
simple
problem
ideationally
as
a
matter
of
fact
for
the
solution
he
required
about
four
times
the
number
of
trials
which
sobke
required
and
twice
as
many
as
were
necessary
for
skirrl
were
we
to
measure
the
intelligence
of
these
three
animals
by
the
number
of
trials
needed
in
problem
sobke
clearly
would
rank
first
skirrl
second
and
julius
last
of
all
but
other
facts
clearly
indicate
that
julius
is
far
superior
to
the
monkeys
in
intelligence
we
therefore
must
conclude
that
very
different
methods
of
learning
appear
the
number
of
trials
is
not
a
safe
criterion
of
the
importance
of
this
conclusion
for
comparative
and
genetic
psychology
needs
no
emphasis
second
from
the
right
julius
was
given
four
days
rest
before
being
presented
with
problem
he
was
occasionally
fed
in
the
apparatus
but
regular
continuation
of
training
was
not
necessary
to
keep
him
in
good
form
during
this
rest
interval
locks
were
attached
to
the
doors
of
the
apparatus
so
that
the
experimenter
by
moving
a
lever
directly
in
front
of
him
could
fasten
either
one
or
both
of
the
doors
of
a
given
box
by
a
single
movement
on
may
julius
was
given
opportunity
to
obtain
food
from
each
of
the
boxes
in
turn
and
trial
of
the
locks
was
made
in
order
to
familiarize
him
with
the
new
situation
he
very
quickly
discovered
that
the
doors
could
not
be
raised
when
closed
and
after
two
days
of
preliminary
work
he
practically
abandoned
his
formerly
persistent
efforts
to
open
them
the
locks
worked
satisfactorily
from
a
mechanical
point
of
view
as
well
as
from
that
of
the
adaptation
of
the
animal
to
the
modified
situation
problem
was
regularly
presented
for
the
first
time
on
may
on
which
day
a
single
series
was
given
the
period
of
punishment
adopted
was
twenty
seconds
and
for
each
successful
choice
a
small
piece
of
banana
was
given
as
a
reward
after
the
first
trial
in
this
series
in
which
julius
repeatedly
entered
the
first
box
at
the
left
that
is
box
there
was
but
slight
tendency
to
reënter
the
first
box
at
the
left
of
the
group
instead
julius
developed
the
method
of
moving
box
by
box
toward
the
right
end
of
the
group
the
choices
were
made
promptly
and
their
systematic
character
enabled
the
animal
to
obtain
his
reward
fairly
quickly
in
spite
of
the
large
number
of
mistakes
in
the
second
series
the
orang
utan
developed
the
interesting
trick
of
quickly
dodging
out
of
the
wrong
box
before
the
experimenter
could
lower
the
door
behind
him
this
he
did
only
after
having
been
punished
for
many
wrong
choices
to
the
point
of
discouragement
the
trick
was
easily
broken
up
by
the
sudden
lowering
of
the
entrance
door
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
under
it
there
appeared
on
may
an
unfavorable
physical
condition
which
manifested
itself
first
of
all
through
the
eyes
which
appeared
dull
and
bloodshot
on
the
following
day
they
were
inflamed
and
the
lids
nearly
closed
julius
refused
to
eat
and
experimentation
was
impossible
until
june
careful
treatment
and
regulation
of
diet
was
necessary
he
passed
through
what
at
the
time
seemed
a
rather
startling
condition
but
rapidly
regained
his
usual
good
health
and
on
june
although
somewhat
weak
and
listless
he
again
worked
fairly
steadily
since
it
was
now
possible
to
lock
the
doors
and
confine
the
animal
for
any
desired
period
on
june
the
interval
of
punishment
was
made
sixty
seconds
and
a
liberal
quantity
of
banana
beet
or
carrot
was
offered
as
reward
no
increase
in
the
number
of
successful
choices
appeared
and
julius
showed
discouragement
sawdust
had
been
strewn
on
the
floor
and
in
the
intervals
between
trials
as
well
as
during
confinement
in
wrong
boxes
he
took
to
playing
with
the
sawdust
he
would
take
it
up
in
one
hand
and
pour
it
from
hand
to
hand
until
all
had
slipped
through
his
fingers
then
he
would
scrape
together
another
handful
and
go
through
the
same
process
often
he
became
so
intent
on
this
form
of
amusement
that
even
when
the
exit
door
was
raised
he
would
not
immediately
go
to
get
the
food
the
reactive
tendencies
which
appeared
in
the
work
on
problem
will
now
be
presented
in
order
since
i
shall
have
to
refer
to
them
repeatedly
and
the
list
will
be
more
useful
to
the
reader
at
this
point
than
at
the
conclusion
of
the
presentation
of
daily
results
the
following
is
not
an
exhaustive
list
but
includes
only
the
most
important
and
conspicuous
tendencies

which
they
were
most
apparent

near
it

and
so
on
until
the

was
reached
this
method
with
irregularities
and
certain
definite
skipping

times

developed
also
the

to
turn
around

sometimes
to
back
into
it

with
the
above
reactive
tendencies
and
modifications
of
method
in
mind
we
may
continue
our
description
of
results
on
june
there
developed
a
tendency
to
increase
the
magnitude
of
the
original
error
by
choosing
nearer
the
left
end
of
the
groups
this
is
odd
since
one
would
naturally
suppose
that
an
animal
as
intelligent
as
the
orang
utan
would
tend
to
avoid
the
general
region
in
which
success
was
never
obtained
and
to
focus
attention
on
the
right
as
contrasted
with
the
wrong
end
of
each
group
obviously
contradicts
the
law
of
the
gradual
elimination
of
use
less
in
other
words
it
is
wholly
at
variance
with
the
principle
of
trial
and
error
exhibited
by
many
infrahuman
organisms
julius
although
making
many
mistakes
worked
diligently
and
for
the
most
part
fairly
rapidly
the
day
work
proved
most
important
because
of
the
change
in
method
and
also
because
of
the
appearance
of
hesitation
the
rejection
of
certain
boxes
and
the
definite
choice
of
others
my
notes
record
this
is
a
most
important
day
for
julius
in
problem
but
subsequent
results
do
not
clearly
justify
this
prophecy
the
method
of
choosing
the
first
box
at
the
left
and
then
of
moving
down
the
line
until
the
right
one
was
reached
was
so
consistently
followed
that
during
a
number
of
days
it
was
possible
for
me
to
predict
almost
every
choice
indeed
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
in
this
matter
during
a
number
of
series
i
guessed
in
advance
the
box
which
would
be
chosen
the
percentages
of
correct
guesses
ranged
from
ninety
to
one
hundred
june
for
example
yielded
two
series
for
which
the
ratio
of
right
to
wrong
first
choices
was
to
and
in
which
the
method
described
above
was
used
consistently
throughout
it
was
inevitable
that
punishment
by
confinement
and
the
discouragement
resulting
therefrom
should
interfere
with
the
regularity
of
work
and
make
it
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
strictly
comparable
results
from
series
to
series
and
from
day
to
day
the
data
for
this
problem
as
presented
in
table
have
values
quite
different
from
those
for
the
monkeys
chiefly
because
of
the
more
variable
conditions
of
observation
it
was
occasionally
noted
that
the
disintegration
of
a
definite
method
and
the
disappearance
of
the
tendency
on
which
it
depended
occurred
rather
suddenly
frequently
it
happened
that
having
used
an
inadequate
method
fairly
persistently
on
a
given
day
the
animal
would
on
the
following
day
exhibit
a
wholly
different
method
even
over
night
a
new
method
might
develop
in
the
monkeys

there
was

something
comparable

julius
it
seemed
desirable
to
introduce
a
radical
change
in
method
in
order
to
stimulate
him
to
maximal
effort
it
was
therefore
decided
to
force
him
to
make
a
round
trip
through
the

in

with

choice
and
to
let
this
forced

largely
because

occurred

that
a
further
modification
of
method
was
introduced
in
that
after
the
same
wrong
box
had
been
entered
five
times
in
succession
the
experimenter
on
the
next
choice
of
the
box
confined
the
animal
for
a
stated
interval
say
sixty
seconds
in
it
and
then
allowed
it
to
escape
by
way
of
the
exit
door
and
choose
repeatedly
until
it
finally
located
the
right
box
were
it
not
for
this
particular
feature
of
the
method
the
number
of
choices
recorded
after
june
would
unquestionably
be
very
much
greater
than
the
table
indicates
the
new
method
proved
a
severe
test
of
the
orang
utan
patience
and
perseverance
for
he
had
to
work
much
harder
than
formerly
for
his
reward
and
often
became
much
fatigued
before
completing
the
regular
series
of
ten
trials
early
in
the
use
of
this
method
he
developed
the
habit
of
rolling
around
from
exit
door
to
starting
point
by
a
series
of
somersaults
when
especially
discouraged
he
would
often
bump
his
head
against
the
floor
so
hard
that
i
could
hear
the
dull
thud
as
has
been
noted
i
found
it
desirable
to
vary
the
procedure
repeatedly
it
proved
especially
interesting
to
give
one
series
per
day
with
the
round
trip
as
punishment
and
another
series
with
confinement
as
punishment
day
after
day
as
the
experiment
progressed
slight
or
great
fluctuations
of
the
ratios
of
right
to
wrong
choices
appeared
but
without
consistent
improvement
there
was
to
be
sure
as
the
last
column
of
table
shows
a
radical
improvement
during
the
first
six
hundred
and
fifty
trials
for
the
number
of
right
choices
per
series
increased
from
to
but
as
the
observations
were
continued
from
day
to
day
it
became
more
and
more
evident
that
the
animal
was
merely
passing
from
tendency
to
tendency
method
to
method
mixing
tendencies
and
occasionally
developing
new
ones
without
approach
to
the
solution
of
the
problem
this
fact
would
have
led
me
to
discontinue
the
work
much
earlier
than
i
actually
did
had
it
not
been
for
the
peculiarity
of
the
results
obtained
with
problem
it
seemed
not
improbable
that
at
any
time
julius
might
succeed
in
perfectly
solving
this
problem
over
night
precisely
as
he
had
solved
the
first
problem
a
curiously
interesting
bit
of
behavior
appeared
for
the
first
time
on
june
julius
had
gone
to
the
first
box
at
the
right
end
of
the
group
and
instead
of
entering
he
had
wheeled
around
toward
his
right
and
turning
a
complete
circle
faced
the
right
box
which
he
promptly
entered
subsequently
the
tendency
developed
and
the
method
was
used
with
increasing
frequency
on
june
it
appeared
in
the
first
series
four
times
in
the
second
series
six
times
on
july
in
the
first
series
three
times
and
in
the
second
series
four
times
on
july
in
the
first
series
five
times
and
in
the
second
series
nine
times
it
was
indeed
only
by
accident
that
the
animal
failed
to
fulfill
the
technical
requirement
for
perfect
solution
of
the
problem
in
this
series
yet
had
he
done
so
his
subsequent
trials
would
doubtless
have
revealed
the
lack
of
any
other
idea
than
that
of
turning
completely
around
before
entering
a
box
this
odd
bit
of
behavior
proved
peculiarly
interesting
and
significant
in
that
the
tendency
to
turn
became
dissociated
from
the
position
in
front
of
the
first
box
at
the
right
end
of
the
group
in
connection
with
which
it
originally
developed
after
a
few
days
julius
would
enter
the
and
instead
of
proceeding
directly
to
the
right
end
of
the
group
would
stop
suddenly
wherever
he
happened
to
be
turn
toward
his
right
in
a
complete
circle
and
hasten
into
the
box
nearest
to
him
which
as
often
as
not
proved
to
be
the
wrong
one
thus
the
idea
of
turning
completely
about
which
had
it
continued
its
association
with
the
idea
of
facing
the
first
box
at
the
right
would
have
yielded
success
instead
became
useless
because
of
its
dissociation
that
the
orang
utan
is
capable
of
using
free
ideas
seems
clear
enough
in
the
light
of
this
behavior
that
he
proved
incapable
of
getting
the
idea
of
second
from
the
right
end
is
as
clearly
shown
by
the
detailed
results
of
table
the
fruits
of
weeks
of
experimenting
certain
other
interesting
tricks
developed
in
julius
behavior
thus
on
july
there
appeared
the
tendency
to
move
as
though
about
to
enter
the
right
box
feint
then
to
stop
suddenly
and
promptly
enter
another
box
which
was
of
course
a
wrong
one
the
reason
for
the
development
of
this
tendency
could
not
be
discovered
but
in
connection
with
it
there
appeared
another
tendency
which
possibly
can
be
explained
julius
took
to
backing
into
the
chosen
box
so
that
he
could
face
the
experimenter
he
would
then
after
a
period
of
hesitation
come
out
and
promptly
enter
one
of
the
other
boxes
this
tendency
was
apparently
due
to
the
fact
that
during
one
or
two
series
the
experimenter
growled
at
the
orang
utan
every
time
he
made
a
mistake
the
growl
startled
him
and
caused
him
to
look
around
he
evidently
felt
the
need
of
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
experimenter
hence
the
backing
into
the
open
box
the
tendency
disappeared
shortly
after
the
experimenter
gave
up
the
use
of
the
growl
as
a
method
of
punishing
the
animal
for
what
were
suspected
to
be
careless
choices
curiously
enough
it
was
not
until
july
that
direct
choice
of
the
right
box
was
made
at
all
frequently
previously
selection
of
it
had
been
made
almost
invariably
after
approach
to
other
boxes
but
in
the
second
series
for
july
there
was
an
extraordinary
improvement
in
method
this
developed
in
the
presence
of
two
visitors
and
it
is
therefore
all
the
more
surprising
the
choices
were
made
not
only
directly
but
with
decision
and
evident
certainty
that
was
quite
at
variance
with
the
previous
behavior
of
the
animal
all
the
while
through
variation
of
methods
i
was
seeking
to
discover
the
best
means
of
holding
the
orang
utan
to
his
maximum
effort
and
care
in
attempting
to
select
the
right
box
one
day
it
would
seem
as
though
forcing
him
to
make
round
trips
with
rewards
only
for
correct
first
choices
proved
most
satisfactory
and
the
next
it
might
seem
equally
clear
that
punishment
by
confinement
for
thirty
seconds
or
sixty
seconds
with
reward
for
correct
choice
in
every
trial
yielded
better
results
in
the
end
i
had
to
admit
that
no
best
method
had
been
demonstrated
and
that
i
had
failed
to
develop
conditions
which
served
to
compel
the
animal
attention
to
the
problem
and
to
lead
him
to
work
without
discouragement
there
were
it
is
true
days
on
which
it
seemed
practically
certain
that
the
problem
would
be
solved
but
as
it
turned
out
julius
never
succeeded
in
choosing
correctly
throughout
a
series
of
ten
trials
as
a
last
resort
in
order
to
make
perfectly
sure
that
the
orang
utan
was
doing
his
best
i
decided
to
introduce
corporal
punishment
in
a
mild
form
for
this
purpose
i
placed
my
assistant
in
charge
of
the
apparatus
and
the
series
of
trials
and
stationed
myself
in
one
corner
of
the
with
a
whip
in
my
hand
whenever
julius
entered
a
wrong
box
i
approached
him
with
the
whip
and
struck
at
him
being
careful
not
to
injure
him
and
rarely
striking
him
at
all
for
the
threat
was
more
effective
than
a
blow
he
was
extremely
afraid
of
the
whip
and
would
begin
to
whine
and
attempt
to
get
out
of
the
way
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
this
method
was
introduced
on
august
but
no
improvement
resulted
and
in
the
end
there
was
no
reason
to
consider
it
more
satisfactory
than
the
other
procedures
i
am
now
wholly
convinced
that
julius
did
his
best
to
choose
correctly
in
the
majority
of
the
numerous
series
which
were
given
him
in
connection
with
problem
from
trials
to
a
radical
departure
from
the
previous
methods
was
introduced
in
that
the
right
box
was
indicated
to
the
animal
by
the
slight
and
momentary
raising
of
its
exit
door
of
course
no
records
of
the
choices
for
this
group
of
one
hundred
trials
appear
in
table
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
animal
inevitably
and
immediately
entered
the
right
box
it
was
thought
that
this
method
might
serve
to
break
up
the
previously
developed
tendencies
toward
inadequate
forms
of
response
and
so
encourage
the
animal
that
he
would
later
solve
the
problem
when
given
opportunity
to
select
the
right
box
without
aid
from
the
experimenter
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
while
the
ratio
of
right
to
wrong
first
choices
was
to
in
the
series
preceding
this
change
of
method
it
was
to
in
the
first
series
following
its
use
there
is
no
satisfactory
evidence
that
julius
profited
by
this
experience
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
succeed
in
making
his
best
daily
record
eight
right
to
two
wrong
choices
on
august
after
trials
the
curve
of
learning
for
this
problem
has
been
plotted
and
is
presented
in
figure
it
is
of
course
incomplete
and
it
is
offered
only
to
indicate
the
extreme
irregularity
in
performance
first
at
the
right
it
was
decided
on
august
that
the
further
continuation
of
the
work
of
julius
on
problem
was
not
worth
while
he
had
become
much
discouraged
and
although
willing
to
work
for
food
gave
no
indications
whatever
of
improvement
and
seemed
to
have
exhausted
his
methods
it
seemed
wise
instead
of
giving
up
work
with
him
in
the
method
to
return
to
a
form
of
problem
we
may
designate
it
as
problem
the
right
box
is
definable
as
the
first
at
the
right
end
of
the
series
instead
of
the
first
at
the
left
end
as
in
the
original
problem
it
was
thought
possible
that
julius
might
quickly
solve
this
problem
by
a
process
similar
to
that
used
for
problem
work
was
begun
on
problem
august
and
for
six
successive
days
two
series
of
trials
per
day
were
given
the
settings
for
which
as
well
as
the
resulting
choices
are
given
in
table
most
notable
in
these
results
is
the
large
number
of
cases
in
which
julius
chose
first
the
second
box
from
the
right
end
of
the
series
or
in
other
words
that
box
which
had
been
the
right
one
in
problem
contrary
to
expectation
he
showed
no
inclination
to
abandon
this
tendency
to
choose
the
second
from
the
right
end
and
the
ratio
of
right
to
wrong
choices
changed
in
the
direction
opposite
from
expectation
beginning
with
to
and
ending
on
the
sixth
day
with
to
it
was
obviously
useless
to
continue
the
experiment
further
since
julius
had
given
up
his
attempts
to
locate
the
right
box
in
the
first
choice
and
was
apparently
satisfied
to
discover
it
by
a
process
of
trial
and
error
he
had
it
would
seem
satisfied
himself
that
the
problem
was
insoluble
these
results
obtained
in
problem
constitute
a
most
interesting
comment
on
the
effects
of
problem
on
the
orang
utan
behavior
similar
to
that
which
he
developed
well
might
have
been
obtained
from
a
child

three
to
four

in

like
situation

strive
day

to
solve
a
problem
beyond
its
ideational
capacity
in
many
respects
the
most
interesting
and
to
the
experimenter
the
most
surprising
result
of
this
long
series
of
observations
with
julius
was
the
lack
of
consistent
improvement
it
seemed
almost
incredible
that
he
should
continue
day
after
day
to
make
incorrect
choices
in
a
particular
setting
while
choosing
correctly
in
some
other
setting

these
relational
problems
because
they
use
the
method
of
elimination
by
trial
consistently
and
effectively
julius
in
these
experiments
made
a
poor
showing
because
his
substitute
for
trial
and
error
is
only
slightly
developed
would
he
have
succeeded
better
with
the
same
problems
if
mentally
mature
there
are
many
important
features
of
the
results
which
for
lack
of
space
have
not
been
indicated
or
discussed
they
can
be
developed
from
later
comparative
studies
of
the
data
for
in
the
tables
appear
all
of
the
essential
facts
of
response
apart
from
those
mentioned
in
the

iv

of
supplementary
tests
of
ideational
behavior
julius
stacking
in
addition
to
the
experiments
which
have
been
described
in
detail
in
the
previous
section
it
was
possible
to
conduct
certain
less
systematic
tests
of
ideational
behavior
in
the
monkeys
and
the
orang
utan
from
the
technical
standpoint
these
tests
were
relatively
unsatisfactory
because
only
inexactly
describable
but
their
results
are
in
many
respects
more
interesting
if
not
also
more
important
in
the
light
which
they
throw
on
ideation
than
are
those
previously
presented
first
in
order
of
time
comes
a
test
which
may
be
designated
as
the
box
stacking
experiment
the
method
will
now
be
described
in
connection
with
an
account
of
the
behavior
of
julius
as
contrasted
with
that
of
a
child
of
three
years
and
four
months
of
age
in
the
large
central
cage
labelled
z
figure
which
was
feet
long
ten
feet
wide
and
ten
to
twelve
feet
deep
the
following
situation
was
arranged
from
the
center
of
the
wire
covering
of
the
cage
a
banana
was
suspended
on
a
string
so
that
it
was
approximately
six
feet
from
the
floor
five
feet
from
either
side
of
the
cage
and
twelve
feet
from
either
end
from
all
approaches
it
was
far
beyond
the
reach
of
julius
since
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
climb
along
the
wire
roof
and
thus
reach
the
string
two
boxes
were
placed
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
several
feet
from
the
point
directly
under
the
banana
the
one
of
these
boxes
was
heavy
and
irregular
in
shape
as
is
shown
in
figures
and
of
plate
its
greatest
height
was
inches
its
least
height
eighteen
inches
its
other
dimensions
twelve
and
sixteen
inches
respectively
the
smaller
and
lighter
box
measured
by
twelve
by
ten
inches
according
to
the
experimenter
calculations
the
only
way
in
which
julius
could
obtain
the
banana
was
by
placing
the
smaller
box
upon
the
larger
and
then
climbing
upon
them
at
on
march
julius
was
admitted
to
the
large
cage
and
the
banana
was
pointed
out
to
him
by
the
experimenter
he
immediately
set
about
trying
to
get
it
and
worked
diligently
during
the
whole
of
the
period
of
observation
which
because
of
the
unfinished
condition
of
some
of
the
cages
was
limited
to
slightly
over
ten
minutes
within
this
period
he
made
upward
of
a
dozen
fairly
well
directed
attempts
to
obtain
the
food
chief
among
them
were
three
attempts
to
reach
the
banana
from
different
positions
on
the
left
wall
of
the
cage
as
the
experimenter
faced
the
laboratory
two
attempts
to
reach
it
from
different
positions
on
the
right
wall
two
from
the
large
box
in
positions
nearly
under
the
banana
two
from
the
large
box
with
the
aid
of
the
experimenter
hand
and
one
from
the
distant
end
of
the
cage
there
occurred
also
less
definite
and
easily
describable
efforts
to
get
at
the
reward
on
account
of
the
unfinished
condition
of
the
cages
the
experimenter
had
to
remain
in
the
large
cage
with
julius
during
the
test
this
interfered
with
the
experiment
because
the
animal
tended
both
to
try
to
escape
and
to
get
the
experimenter
to
help
him
with
his
task
particularly
interesting
is
the
latter
sort
of
behavior
after
the
orang
utan
had
made
two
or
three
futile
attempts
to
obtain
the
food
he
came
to
the
experimenter
who
was
standing
in
one
corner
of
the
cage
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
a
point
directly
under
the
banana
he
then
looked
up
toward
the
banana
grasped
the
experimenter
arm
raised
it
and
then
tried
to
pull
himself
up
he
was
not
allowed
to
get
the
food
by
climbing
up
on
the
experimenter
a
few
minutes
later
he
again
led
the
experimenter
toward
the
banana
but
receiving
discouragement
in
this
activity
he
proceeded
to
devote
himself
to
other
methods
apart
from
the
distractions
which
have
been
mentioned
above
attention
to
the
food
was
surprisingly
constant
whatever
his
position
with
respect
to
it
he
seemed
not
for
an
instant
to
lose
his
motive
and
to
whatever
part
of
the
cage
he
went
and
whatever
he
did
during
the
interval
of
observation
was
evidently
guided
by
the
strong
desire
to
obtain
the
banana
frequently
he
would
look
directly
at
it
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
try
some
new
method
of
reaching
it
his
gaze
was
deliberate
and
in
the
handling
of
the
boxes
he
accurately
gauged
distances
several
times
he
succeeded
in
placing
the
larger
box
almost
directly
under
the
banana
and
repeatedly
he
located
that
portion
of
the
side
wall
from
which
he
could
most
nearly

quote
the

comment
on
the
results
of
the
initial
experiment
despite
all
that
has
been
written
concerning
the
intelligent
behavior
of
the
orang
utan
i
was
amazed
by
behavior
this
morning
for
it
was
far
more
deliberate
and
apparently
reflective
as
well
as
more
persistently
directed
toward
the
goal
than
i
had
anticipated
i
had
looked
for
sporadic
attempts
to
obtain
the
banana
with
speedy
discouragement
and
such
fluctuations
of
attention
as
would
be
exhibited
by
a
child
of
two
to
four
years
but
in
less
than
ten
minutes
julius
made
at
least
ten
obvious
and
well
directed
attempts
to
reach
the
food
there
were
also
wanderings
efforts
to
obtain
aid
from
the
experimenter
and
varied
attempts
to
escape
from
the
cage
before
proceeding
further
with
the
description
of
the
behavior
of
julius
in
the
box
stacking
test
i
shall
describe
for
contrast
the
behavior
of
a
boy
three
years
four
months
of
age
when
confronted
with
a
situation
practically
identical
with
that
which
the
ape
was
given
an
opportunity
to
meet
for
the
child
the
banana
was
suspended
as
previously
described
from
the
roof
of
the
cage
the
same
two
boxes
were
placed
on
the
floor
at
considerable
distances
from
the
banana
and
in
addition
a
light
stick
about
six
feet
long
and
a
piece
of
board
the
latter
by
accident
were
on
the
floor
the
child
was
asked
to
get
the
banana
for
julius
and
he
eagerly
and
confidently
volunteered
to
do
so
his
behavior
may
best
be
described
by
enumeration
of
the
several
attempts
made
they
include
placing
the
larger
box
nearly
under
the
banana
and
reaching
from
it
standing
of
the
larger
box
on
end
with
resulting
failure
because
the
child
could
not
stand
on
the
sloping
edges
of
the
top
of
the
box
the
larger
box
was
turned
on
its
side
and
the
lighter
box
drawn
up
opposite
it
and
stood
on
end
the
child
then
mounted
the
larger
box
and
from
it
stepped
to
the
top
of
the
smaller
but
the
boxes
had
not
been
placed
beneath
the
banana
and
when
the
child
reached
for
it
he
found
himself
several
feet
away
from
his
prize
the
boxes
were
moved
to
a
position
nearly
under
the
banana
and
another
futile
attempt
was
made
to
reach
it
without
placing
the
smaller
box
on
top
of
the
larger
one
the
only
position
from
which
the
child
could
readily
obtain
it
the
piece
of
board
was
placed
on
top
of
the
larger
box
and
from
this
height
the
child
again
reached
upward
the
stick
was
taken
up
and
an
attempt
was
made
to
strike
the
banana
and
thus
dislodge
it
but
it
was
too
securely
fastened
to
be
obtained
thus
attention
shifted
to
other
things
and
the
child
played
for
a
time
with
the
board
reminded
of
the
banana
by
the
experimenter
he
again
tried
method
he
again
used
the
stick
on
the
banana
the
effort
to
knock
the
prize
to
the
floor
having
failed
he
became
discouraged
and
said
that
he
must
go
home
when
told
that
julius
was
very
hungry
and
wanted
the
banana
he
repeated
efforts
similar
to
those
described
in
and
up
to
this
time
the
observations
had
covered
a
period
of
twenty
minutes
the
child
was
now
taken
from
the
cage
and
allowed
to
play
about
for
fifteen
minutes
asked
then
whether
he
would
go
back
and
try
to
get
the
banana
he
replied
no
i
do
want
to
get
it
thus
indicating
his
discouragement
with
the
situation
when
taken
into
the
cage
he
nevertheless
made
the
additional
attempts
indicated
below
use
of
one
of
the
boxes
he
remarked
now
i
know
i
get
it
and
after
so
saying
repeated
failing
he
turned
to
me
and
said
i
could
get
it
if
i
was
on
your
head
but
he
did
not
as
julius
had
done
lead
me
to
the
proper
place
and
try
to
reach
the
banana
by
climbing
up
or
by
urging
me
to
lift
him
later
he
played
in
the
boxes
apparently
forgetful
of
his
task
finally
he
remarked
i
get
the
banana
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
do
so
and
instead
watched
the
monkeys
intently
thereafter
he
showed
no
further
interest
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
and
the
experiment
after
a
total
period
of
minutes
was
discontinued
comparison
of
the
behavior
of
the
ape
with
that
of
the
child
indicates
a
greater
variety
of
ideas
for
the
latter
julius
gauged
his
distances
much
more
accurately
than
the
child
attended
more
steadily
and
worked
more
persistently
to
obtain
the
reward
but
he
did
not
so
nearly
approach
the
idea
of
stacking
the
boxes
as
did
the
child
for
the
latter
in
placing
the
board
on
one
of
the
boxes
exhibited
in
ineffective
form
the
idea
which
should
have
yielded
the
solution
of
the
problem
the
child
was
given
no
further
opportunity
to
work
at
the
problem
whereas
julius
as
i
shall
now
describe
continued
his
efforts
on
subsequent
days
under
somewhat
different
conditions
on
wednesday
march
the
banana
was
suspended
as
formerly
and
three
boxes
all
of
them
small
and
light
enough
to
be
readily
handled
by
the
ape
were
placed
in
distant
parts
of
the
cage
the
stick
which
had
been
present
in
the
test
with
the
child
but
not
in
the
first
test
with
julius
was
also
placed
in
the
cage
julius
was
allowed
to
work
for
about
an
hour
as
formerly
he
was
sufficiently
hungry
to
be
eager
to
get
the
food
and
evidently
tried
all
of
the
possible
ways
which
occurred
to
him
chief
among
these
were
the
use
of
the
various
boxes
separately
or
in
pairs
in
very
varied
positions
but
never
with
one
upon
another
the
only
way
in
which
the
banana
could
be
reached
climbing
to
various
points
on
the
sides
of
the
cage
with
infrequent
attempts
to
reach
the
banana
usually
his
eyes
saved
him
the
vain
effort
unlike
the
child
julius
paid
little
attention
to
the
stick
two
or
three
times
he
took
it
up
and
seemingly
reached
for
the
banana
but
in
no
case
did
he
try
persistently
to
strike
it
and
knock
it
from
the
string
it
is
but
fair
however
to
remark
that
such
an
act
is
very
difficult
for
the
young
orang
utan
as
compared
with
the
child
because
of
the
weakness
of
the
legs
and
the
awkwardness
of
striking
from
a
sitting
posture
as
previously
the
steadiness
of
attention
and
the
persistence
of
effort
toward
the
end
in
view
were
most
surprising
at
one
time
julius
walked
to
the
end
of
the
cage
and
there
happened
to
see
one
of
the
monkeys
eating
he
watched
intently
a
few
seconds
and
then
hastened
back
to
the
banana
as
if
his
task
had
been
suggested
to
him
by
the
sight
of
the
feeding
animal
most
interesting
and
significant
in
this
behavior
was
the
suddenness
with
which
he
would
turn
to
a
new
method
it
often
looked
precisely
as
though
a
new
idea
had
come
to
him
and
he
was
all
eagerness
to
try
it
out
on
march
julius
was
given
another
opportunity
to
obtain
the
banana
by
the
use
of
the
three
boxes
although
he
used
them
together
he
made
no
effort
to
place
one
upon
another
certain
of
his
methods
are
shown
in
plate
v
especially
by
figures
and
this
experiment
was
continued
on
april
under
yet
different
conditions
for
this
time
only
two
boxes
were
placed
in
the
cage
the
one
of
them
the
heavy
box
and
the
other
the
smaller
lighter
one
originally
used
on
the
end
of
the
heavier
box
had
been
nailed
a
two
by
two
inch
wooden
block
in
order
to
increase
the
difficulty
in
using
this
box
alone
as
previously
julius
made
varied
attempts
to
obtain
the
banana
but
on
the
whole
his
interest
and
attention
seemed
somewhat
weaker
than
previously
and
there
were
indications
of
discouragement
because
of
repeated
failures
he
handled
the
boxes
conspicuously
well
and
it
seemed
at
times
that
he
would
certainly
succeed
in
placing
the
one
upon
the
other
and
in
reaching
the
food
after
one
series
of
attempts
from
the
sides
of
the
cage
and
from
the
large
box
he
deliberately
turned
away
from
the
box
and
neatly
executed
a
somersault
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
as
much
as
to
say
i
am
disgusted
with
the
whole
situation
again
later
on
the
same
day
after
falling
from
the
top
of
the
larger
box
which
tilted
over
very
easily
he
rolled
himself
into
a
ball
and
childlike
played
with
his
feet
an
additional
evidence
of
his
changed
affective
attitude
toward
his
task
especially
in
connection
with
definite
failures
appeared
in
his
rough
handling
and
biting
of
the
boxes
when
most
impatient
he
worked
very
roughly
julius
was
allowed
to
work
for
the
reward
from
thirty
to
ninety
minutes
or
as
a
rule
until
he
had
become
completely
discouraged
on
april
and
his
behavior
was
interesting
and
significant
but
nothing
new
appeared
except
that
his
willingness
to
work
gradually
disappeared
and
on
april
although
previously
hungry
he
made
only
a
single
attempt
to
obtain
the
banana
and
then
paid
no
further
attention
to
it
the
prolonged
and
varied
efforts
to
obtain
the
banana
were
due
in
a
measure
at
least
to
three
accidental
successes
thus
on
april
and
again
on
the
by
fortunate
combinations
of
circumstances
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
banana
contrary
to
the
intention
of
the
experimenter
although
active
at
first
on
april
he
soon
wearied
of
his
task
and
quit
work
the
same
was
true
on
april
and
again
on
the
and
on
these
days
although
hungry
he
did
not
care
to
enter
the
large
cage
and
worked
only
a
few
minutes
each
day
seldom
making
more
than
two
or
three
attempts
to
obtain
the
banana
his
attitude
toward
the
task
had
changed
completely
in
that
hopelessness
had
taken
the
place
of
eager
expectancy
by
the
of
april
he
had
so
nearly
given
up
voluntary
efforts
to
solve
the
problem
that
it
seemed
worth
while
to
test
his
ability
to
get
the
idea
by
watching
the
experimenter
for
this
purpose
the
following
test
of
imitation
was
made
on
the
morning
of
april
having
placed
a
banana
in
the
usual
position
i
took
julius
into
the
large
cage
dragged
the
two
boxes
to
the
proper
position
beneath
the
banana
placed
the
smaller
one
upon
the
larger
one
and
then
climbed
up
on
them
to
show
the
ape
that
i
could
reach
the
banana
i
then
stepped
down
and
gave
him
a
chance
to
climb
on
the
boxes
he
did
so
immediately
and
obtained
the
food
another
piece
of
banana
was
supplied
the
boxes
were
placed
in
distant
corners
of
the
cage
and
fifteen
minutes
were
allowed
julius
so
to
place
them
that
he
could
obtain
his
reward
he
gave
no
indications
of
having
profited
by
my
demonstration
but
worked
with
the
boxes
singly
usually
with
the
larger
one
on
april
with
the
banana
in
position
and
the
two
boxes
also
in
the
cage
julius
was
admitted
and
allowed
to
work
for
five
minutes
but
again
without
success
i
then
placed
the
boxes
properly
for
him
and
he
immediately
climbed
up
and
got
the
banana
while
he
was
eating
the
boxes
were
carried
to
distant
corners
of
the
cage
and
another
banana
placed
in
position
now
thirty
minutes
were
allowed
him
for
unaided
work
on
the
problem
as
formerly
the
larger
box
was
used
repeatedly
and
attempts
to
reach
from
the
side
of
the
cage
appeared
but
there
was
no
tendency
to
try
to
use
the
two
boxes
together
he
worked
fairly
persistently
however
and
showed
clearly
the
stimulating
and
encouraging
effect
of
aid
from
the
experimenter
once
more
on
april
julius
was
taken
into
the
cage
and
allowed
to
watch
me
place
the
boxes
in
proper
position
he
then
climbed
up
and
obtained
the
desired
food
after
the
bait
had
been
renewed
and
the
boxes
displaced
he
immediately
tried
to
use
the
larger
one
then
he
reached
for
the
small
one
as
though
to
use
both
together
but
the
impulse
died
out
and
he
turned
again
to
the
larger
box
as
usual
standing
it
on
end
and
persistently
trying
to
balance
himself
on
it
nothing
else
of
special
interest
happened
during
the
interval
of
unaided
effort
similarly
i
placed
the
boxes
for
the
ape
on
april
allowed
him
to
get
the
banana
and
then
gave
him
opportunity
to
try
for
himself
after
the
boxes
had
been
displaced
this
time
he
immediately
reached
for
the
smaller
box
and
moved
it
about
a
little
thus
indicating
a
new
association
he
next
turned
to
the
larger
box
and
worked
with
it
persistently
later
he
once
more
worked
with
the
smaller
box
in
an
unusual
manner
he
repeatedly
stood
on
it
but
made
no
attempt
to
lift
it
or
to
place
it
on
the
larger
box
clearly
the
usually
neglected
smaller
box
had
become
associated
with
the
satisfaction
of
obtaining
the
banana
the
same
method
was
carried
out
on
april
as
i
placed
the
boxes
in
position
beneath
the
banana
julius
watched
with
unusual
intentness
and
when
it
came
his
turn
to
try
to
obtain
the
food
by
the
use
of
the
boxes
he
began
at
once
to
work
with
the
smaller
box
but
as
on
april
he
soon
abandoned
it
and
turned
to
the
other
while
i
was
making
note
of
this
particular
feature
of
his
behavior
he
suddenly
seized
the
smaller
box
by
two
corners
with
his
hands
and
by
one
edge
with
his
teeth
and
after
a
few
attempts
placed
it
on
top
of
the
larger
box
climbed
up
and
obtained
the
banana
because
of
bad
weather
on
april
the
next
test
was
made
on
april
with
everything
as
usual
unaided
the
ape
was
given
an
opportunity
to
obtain
the
coveted
reward
while
i
stood
ready
to
obtain
records
of
his
behavior
with
my
camera
he
wasted
no
time
but
piled
the
smaller
box
on
top
of
the
larger
one
immediately
and
obtained
his
reward
as
soon
as
opportunity
was
offered
he
repeated
the
performance
the
same
thing
happened
on
april
and
several
succeeding
dates
julius
had
got
the
idea
and
the
only
further
improvement
possible
was
in
skill
in
manipulating
the
boxes
one
of
the
curious
performances
which
appeared
during
the
imitative
period
is
pictured
in
figure
plate
v
where
the
ape
is
seen
lifting
the
smaller
box
into
the
air
this
he
did
three
or
four
times
one
day
raising
it
toward
the
banana
each
time
as
though
he
expected
thus
to
obtain
the
reward
as
he
did
not
go
up
with
the
box
according
to
his
expectation
he
abandoned
this
method
and
looking
about
discovered
the
larger
box
in
a
distant
corner
thereupon
he
promptly
pulled
the
boxes
to
their
proper
position
beneath
the
banana
stacked
them
and
obtained
his
food
after
considerable
skill
had
been
acquired
in
the
placing
of
the
boxes
the
one
upon
the
other
the
height
of
the
banana
above
the
floor
was
increased
so
that
three
boxes
were
necessary
figure
of
plate
v
shows
him
standing
on
three
boxes
and
reaching
upward
and
figures
and
show
various
modes
of
handling
the
boxes
and
of
reaching
from
them
he
was
not
at
all
particular
as
to
the
stability
of
his
perch
and
often
mounted
the
boxes
when
it
seemed
to
the
experimenter
inevitable
that
they
should
topple
over
and
precipitate
him
to
the
floor
only
once
however
during
the
several
days
of
experimentation
did
he
thus
fall
obviously
important
is
the
evident
change
in
the
animal
attention
on
april
he
watched
with
a
keenness
of
interest
which
betokened
a
dawning
idea
before
he
had
succeeded
in
stacking
the
boxes
i
had
written
in
my
he
seemed
much
interested
today
in
my
placing
of
the
boxes
interesting
and
important
also
is
the
ease
and
efficiency
with
which
he
met
the
situation
time
after
time
after
this
first
success
trial
and
error
had
no
obvious
part
in
the
development
of
the
really
essential
features
of
the
behavior
the
ape
had
the
idea
and
upon
it
depended
for
guidance
except
for
the
fact
that
julius
was
immature
probably
under
five
years
of
age
it
is
likely
that
he
would
have
stacked
the
boxes
spontaneously
instead
of
by
suggestion
from
the
experimenter
or
imitatively
no
unprejudiced
psychologist
would
be
likely
to
interpret
the
activities
of
the
orang
utan
in
the
experiment
as
other
than
imaginal
or
ideational
he
went
directly
and
in
the
most
way
from
point
to
point
from
method
to
method
trying
in
turn
and
more
or
less
persistently
or
repeatedly
almost
all
of
the
possible
ways
of
obtaining
the
coveted
food
the
fact
that
he
did
not
happen
upon
the
only
certain
road
to
success
is
surprising
indeed
in
view
of
the
many
ineffective
methods
which
he
used
it
seemed
almost
as
though
he
avoided
the
easy
method
it
is
especially
important
in
connection
with
these
results
to
point
out
the
risk
of
misinterpretation
of
observations
on
the
anthropoid
apes
if
they
can
imitate
human
activities
as
readily
and
effectively
as
julius
did
in
this
particular
experiment
we
can
never
be
sure
of
the
spontaneity
of
their
ideational
behavior
unless
we
definitely
know
that
they
have
had
no
opportunity
to
see
human
beings
perform
similar
acts
of
all
the
methods
of
eliciting
ideational
or
allied
forms
of
behavior
used
in
my
study
of
the
monkeys
and
ape
none
yielded
such
illuminating
results
as
the
box
stacking
test
and
although
from
the
technical
standpoint
it
has
many
shortcomings
as
a
means
to
qualitative
results
it
has
proved
invaluable
methods
of
obtaining
the
some
weeks
later
i
tried
to
discover
how
julius
would
obtain
the
much
desired
banana
when
the
boxes
were
absent
i
placed
in
the
large
cage
a
stick
about
six
feet
long
and
an
old
broom
when
admitted
he
looked
about
for
the
boxes
but
not
seeing
them
picked
up
the
broom
and
placing
it
with
the
splints
down
beneath
the
banana
he
tried
to
climb
it
but
as
it
fell
over
with
him
he
abandoned
this
after
a
few
trials
went
to
his
cage
and
picking
up
some
old
bags
which
he
used
at
night
as
covers
he
dragged
them
out
and
placed
them
on
the
floor
beneath
the
banana
he
next
put
the
broom
upon
them
and
tried
to
climb
up
this
general
type
of
behavior
persisted
for
several
minutes
everything
within
reach
being
used
as
were
the
bags
as
a
means
of
raising
him
in
the
desired
direction
finally
he
placed
his
feet
on
the
broom
where
the
handle
joins
the
splints
seized
the
handle
near
the
top
with
his
hands
drew
himself
up
as
far
as
possible
and
then
launched
himself
in
the
air
and
tried
to
seize
the
banana
on
the
third
attempt
he
succeeded
later
he
was
given
a
plain
stick
about
five
feet
long
figure
of
plate
vi
shows
him
using
this
to
obtain
the
banana
in
the
manner
described
above
he
would
grasp
it
with
one
or
both
feet
usually
one
ten
to
fifteen
inches
from
the
floor
of
the
cage
meanwhile
holding
with
his
hands
near
the
top
of
the
stick
he
would
then
with
all
his
strength
draw
himself
up
suddenly
and
jump
toward
the
banana
often
he
came
down
rather
hard
on
the
cement
floor
much
to
his
disgust
yet
another
method
of
obtaining
the
reward
developed
a
day
or
two
later
a
light
stick
about
five
feet
long
and
an
inch
in
its
other
dimensions
was
the
only
object
in
the
cage
which
could
possibly
be
of
use
in
obtaining
the
banana
the
aim
of
the
experimenter
was
to
discover
whether
julius
would
use
this
as
a
club
previously
in
connection
with
the
use
of
the
boxes
he
had
taken
up
the
same
stick
two
or
three
times
and
reached
for
the
banana
with
it
but
in
no
case
had
he
struck
at
it
or
clearly
tried
to
knock
it
from
the
string
as
did
the
child
most
readily
and
naturally
when
provided
with
this
same
stick
and
it
alone
as
a
means
of
obtaining
the
food
he
hit
upon
the
following
interesting
method
placing
one
end
of
the
stick
between
a
wooden
brace
and
the
wire
side
of
the
cage
he
climbed
up
to
a
level
with
the
banana
as
is
shown
in
figure
of
plate
vi
then
holding
with
one
hand
and
one
foot
to
a
timber
of
the
cage
and
to
the
stick
with
his
other
foot
he
swung
outward
as
far
as
possible
and
reached
the
banana
with
his
free
hand
having
once
succeeded
by
the
method
he
used
it
whenever
given
an
opportunity
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
make
the
reach
without
the
use
of
the
small
stick
while
with
it
he
succeeded
fairly
easily
and
regularly
and
pole
following
the
box
stacking
test
julius
was
given
an
opportunity
to
exhibit
ideation
in
another
type
of
experiment
this
may
be
designated
the
box
and
pole
test
the
conditions
are
describable
thus
a
strong
wooden
box
inches
long
by
four
inches
wide
by
four
inches
deep
with
open
ends
was
built
with
one
side
hinged
hasps
and
padlocks
enabled
the
experimenter
to
lock
this
lid
after
food
had
been
placed
in
the
center
of
the
box
this
box
could
be
placed
in
the
center
of
the
large
cage
and
there
fastened
by
means
of
cross
bars
it
is
well
shown
in
position
in
figure
plate
two
poles
each
eight
feet
long
and
approximately
one
and
a
half
inches
in
their
other
dimensions
were
the
only
additional
materials
in
the
experiment
on
may
julius
was
allowed
to
see
the
experimenter
place
a
half
banana
in
this
box
close
the
lid
lock
it
in
position
and
securely
fasten
the
box
by
means
of
the
cross
bars
he
was
then
given
opportunity
to
try
to
get
the
banana
the
two
poles
lay
on
opposite
sides
of
the
box
and
near
the
edges
of
the
cage
doctor
hamilton
and
the
writer
were
in
the
cage
watching
julius
looked
into
the
box
through
one
end
and
seeing
the
banana
reached
for
it
he
could
not
obtain
it
in
this
way
so
he
began
to
bite
at
the
box
and
to
pull
at
it
with
all
his
strength
during
the
fifteen
minutes
allowed
him
he
worked
at
the
box
in
a
great
variety
of
ways
fooling
with
the
locks
which
had
been
attached
to
the
hasps
as
well
as
with
the
cross
bars
and
continually
reaching
in
at
the
one
or
the
other
end
he
was
somewhat
distracted
by
the
presence
of
the
two
observers
and
attended
rather
unsatisfactorily
to
the
task
in
hand
not
once
did
he
touch
the
poles
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
even
noticed
them
he
was
not
very
hungry
at
this
time
and
after
a
few
minutes
active
work
he
virtually
gave
up
trying
to
get
the
food
two
days
later
on
may
the
box
was
once
more
placed
in
position
this
time
with
a
half
banana
in
the
middle
and
a
small
piece
of
banana
near
each
open
end
the
two
poles
lay
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
each
several
feet
distant
from
the
box
julius
was
eager
for
food
when
released
he
went
immediately
to
the
box
reached
in
and
obtained
a
piece
of
banana
from
the
end
nearer
the
laboratory
he
then
looked
in
and
saw
the
piece
near
the
middle
of
the
box
his
next
move
was
to
pick
up
the
eight
foot
pole
and
push
it
into
the
box
but
before
pushing
it
all
the
way
through
he
stopped
and
began
to
pull
at
the
box
in
various
ways
shortly
he
returned
to
the
pole
and
twice
thrust
it
in
as
far
as
he
could
reach
the
first
time
after
thrusting
it
all
the
way
through
he
pulled
it
out
and
examined
the
end
as
though
expecting
the
banana
to
come
out
with
it
after
a
third
attempt
he
looked
into
the
box
presumably
seeing
the
banana
then
turned
a
backward
somersault
came
to
the
end
of
the
cage
and
looked
at
me
had
it
been
at
all
possible
he
would
have
taken
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
to
the
box
as
a
helper
after
a
few
seconds
he
returned
to
the
pole
pried
the
lid
of
the
box
with
it
then
gnawed
at
the
pole
for
about
five
minutes
he
worked
fairly
rapidly
and
steadily
using
the
poles
pulling
gnawing
and
walking
about
his
next
move
was
to
go
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
box
look
in
take
the
piece
of
banana
which
was
near
the
opening
then
pick
up
the
second
pole
which
had
not
previously
been
noticed
and
after
a
number
of
attempts
push
it
into
and
through
the
box
looking
after
it
and
then
pulling
it
out
and
looking
into
the
box
having
done
this
he
again
came
to
my
end
of
the
cage
and
from
there
returned
to
try
once
more
with
the
pole
which
he
had
first
used
he
pushed
this
pole
all
the
way
through
then
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
box
looked
in
and
reaching
in
obtained
the
banana
which
had
been
pushed
far
enough
along
to
be
within
his
grasp
figures
and
of
plate
v
show
stages
of
this
process
julius
had
worked
minutes
with
relatively
little
lost
time
before
succeeding
he
had
shown
almost
from
the
start
the
idea
of
using
the
pole
as
an
instrument
and
his
sole
difficulty
was
in
making
the
pole
serve
the
desired
purpose
the
experiment
was
rendered
still
more
crucial
on
may
by
the
placing
of
the
two
poles
upright
in
opposite
corners
of
the
large
cage
for
a
few
minutes
after
he
entered
the
cage
julius
did
not
see
them
and
his
time
was
spent
pulling
and
gnawing
at
the
box
then
he
discovered
one
of
the
poles
seized
it
and
pushed
it
into
the
box
he
tried
four
times
then
went
and
got
the
other
pole
and
pushed
it
into
the
opposite
end
of
the
box
twice
he
did
this
then
he
returned
to
the
original
pole
bringing
the
second
one
with
him
he
pushed
it
in
beside
the
first
and
as
it
happened
shoved
the
banana
out
of
the
opposite
end
of
the
box
but
he
did
not
see
this
and
only
after
several
seconds
when
he
happened
to
walk
to
that
end
of
the
box
did
he
discover
the
banana
the
total
time
until
success
was
fifteen
minutes
subsequently
the
ape
became
very
expert
in
using
the
pole
to
obtain
the
banana
and
often
only
a
minute
or
two
sufficed
for
success
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
direct
the
stick
very
accurately
for
when
he
was
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
look
through
the
box
he
could
not
work
the
stick
itself
it
was
therefore
always
a
matter
of
chance
whether
he
obtained
the
banana
immediately
or
only
after
a
number
of
trials
although
it
is
possible
that
the
use
of
the
poles
in
this
experiment
was
due
to
observation
of
human
activities
it
seems
probable
in
the
light
of
what
we
know
of
the
natural
behavior
of
the
anthropoid
apes
that
julius
would
have
solved
this
problem
independently
of
human
influence
it
was
the
expectation
of
the
experimenter
that
the
pole
would
be
used
to
push
the
banana
through
the
box
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
ape
used
it
first
of
all
to
pull
the
food
toward
him
thus
indicating
a
natural
tendency
which
is
important
in
connection
with
the
statements
just
made
subsequently
he
learned
that
the
banana
must
be
pushed
through
and
obtained
at
the
farther
end
of
the
box
i
am
not
prepared
to
accept
the
solution
of
this
problem
as
satisfactory
evidence
of
ideation
but
i
do
know
that
few
observers
could
have
watched
the
behavior
of
the
orang
utan
without
being
convinced
that
he
was
acting
ideationally
an
interesting
contrast
with
the
box
and
pole
test
is
furnished
by
what
may
be
called
the
experiment
this
was
planned
as
a
simple
test
of
julius
ability
to
use
a
stick
to
draw
things
into
his
cage
from
beyond
the
wire
side
a
board
was
placed
as
is
shown
in
figure
of
plate
vi
with
sides
to
hold
a
banana
carrot
or
some
other
bit
of
food
in
position
in
the
actual
test
either
a
carrot
or
a
banana
was
placed
about
two
feet
from
the
wire
netting
and
a
stick
two
feet
long
was
then
put
into
the
cage
with
the
ape
when
this
situation
was
first
presented
to
julius
he
looked
at
the
banana
reached
for
it
and
failing
picked
up
a
bag
from
the
floor
of
the
cage
and
tried
to
push
it
through
the
wire
mesh
toward
the
banana
he
also
used
a
bit
of
wire
in
the
same
way
but
was
unable
thus
to
get
the
food
as
soon
as
a
stick
was
placed
in
his
cage
he
grasped
it
and
used
it
in
a
very
definite
although
unskillful
way
to
pull
the
banana
toward
him
he
was
extremely
eager
and
impatient
but
nevertheless
persistent
in
his
efforts
and
within
five
minutes
from
the
beginning
of
the
first
trial
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
two
pieces
of
banana
using
always
his
left
hand
to
manipulate
the
stick
this
test
was
repeated
a
number
of
times
with
similar
results
he
had
from
the
first
the
ability
to
use
a
stick
in
this
way
and
the
only
difficulty
with
the
test
as
a
means
of
obtaining
evidence
of
ideational
behavior
is
that
the
possibility
of
imitation
of
man
can
not
be
certainly
excluded
and
key
by
my
assistant
it
was
reported
on
may
that
the
orang
utan
had
been
seen
to
place
a
splinter
of
wood
in
a
padlock
which
was
used
on
the
cages
and
to
work
with
it
persistently
it
looked
very
much
like
imitation
of
the
human
act
of
using
the
key
and
i
therefore
planned
a
test
to
ascertain
whether
julius
could
readily
and
skillfully
use
a
key
or
could
learn
quickly
to
do
so
by
watching
me
the
first
test
was
made
on
may
with
a
heavy
box
whose
hinged
lid
was
held
securely
in
position
by
means
of
a
hasp
and
a
padlock
the
key
which
was
not
more
than
an
inch
in
length
was
fastened
to
a
six
inch
piece
of
wire
so
that
julius
could
not
readily
lose
it
with
the
animal
opposite
me
i
placed
a
piece
of
banana
in
the
box
then
closed
the
lid
and
snapped
the
padlock
i
next
handed
julius
the
key
he
immediately
laid
it
on
the
floor
opposite
him
and
began
biting
the
box
rolling
it
around
and
occasionally
biting
also
at
the
lock
and
pulling
at
it
during
these
activities
he
had
pulled
the
box
toward
his
cage
now
he
suddenly
looked
up
to
the
position
where
the
banana
had
been
suspended
in
the
box
experiment
evidently
the
box
had
suggested
to
him
the
banana
for
thirty
minutes
he
struggled
with
the
box
almost
continuously
chewing
persistently
at
the
hinges
the
hasp
or
the
lock
then
he
took
the
key
in
his
teeth
and
tried
to
push
it
into
one
of
the
hinges
then
into
the
crack
beneath
the
lid
of
the
box
subsequently
i
allowed
him
to
see
me
use
the
key
repeatedly
and
as
a
result
he
came
to
use
it
himself
now
and
then
on
the
edge
of
the
box
but
he
never
succeeded
in
placing
it
in
the
lock
and
the
outcome
of
the
experiment
was
total
failure
on
the
part
of
the
animal
to
unfasten
the
lock
of
his
own
initiative
or
to
learn
to
use
the
key
by
watching
me
do
so
i
did
not
make
any
special
attempt
to
teach
him
to
use
the
key
but
merely
gave
him
opportunity
to
imitate
and
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
that
he
would
have
succeeded
had
the
key
been
larger
and
had
the
situation
required
less
accurately
coordinated
movements
however
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
evidence
of
the
idea
of
using
the
key
in
the
lock
was
unconvincing
my
assistant
observation
was
perhaps
misleading
in
so
far
as
it
suggested
that
idea
it
may
and
probably
was
purely
by
accident
that
the
animal
used
the
splinter
on
the
padlock
skirrl
stacking
the
monkey
skirrl
was
tested
by
means
of
the
box
stacking
experiment
much
as
julius
had
been
on
august
with
a
carrot
suspended
six
feet
from
the
floor
of
the
large
cage
and
three
boxes
in
distant
corners
the
animal
was
admitted
and
his
behavior
noted
the
boxes
which
were
made
of
light
thin
material
ranged
in
size
from
one
six
inches
in
its
several
dimensions
to
one
twenty
inches
long
thirteen
inches
wide
and
eleven
inches
deep
only
by
using
at
least
two
of
these
boxes
was
it
possible
for
the
animal
to
reach
the
carrot
immediately
on
admission
to
the
cage
skirrl
began
to
gnaw
at
the
boxes
trying
with
all
his
might
to
tear
them
to
pieces
after
some
thirty
minutes
of
such
effort
interrupted
by
wanderings
about
the
cage
and
attempts
to
get
at
the
other
monkeys
he
suddenly
went
to
the
largest
box
of
all
set
it
up
on
end
almost
directly
under
the
carrot
mounted
it
and
looked
up
at
the
food
it
was
still
beyond
his
reach
and
he
made
no
effort
to
get
it
but
instead
he
reached
from
his
perch
on
the
big
box
for
the
next
smaller
box
which
was
approximately
sixteen
inches
by
fourteen
by
twelve
this
he
succeeded
in
pulling
toward
him
at
the
same
time
raising
it
slightly
from
the
floor
but
his
efforts
caused
the
large
box
to
topple
over
and
he
quit
work
the
experiment
was
discontinued
after
a
few
minutes
the
total
period
of
observation
having
been
minutes
skirrl
handled
the
boxes
with
ease
and
with
evident
pleasure
and
interest
he
also
noticed
the
carrot
at
various
times
during
the
interval
but
his
attention
was
fixed
on
it
only
for
short
periods
the
test
was
continued
on
august
when
instead
of
a
carrot
a
half
banana
was
used
as
bait
it
was
placed
only
five
feet
from
the
floor
and
three
boxes
were
as
formerly
placed
in
distant
corners
of
the
cage
when
admitted
skirrl
looked
at
the
banana
then
pulled
one
of
the
boxes
toward
it
but
instead
of
mounting
he
went
to
the
smallest
box
and
began
to
gnaw
it
shortly
he
mounted
the
middle
sized
box
and
looked
up
toward
the
banana
but
the
box
was
not
directly
under
the
bait
and
in
any
event
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
reach
it
he
next
went
to
the
largest
box
gnawed
it
vigorously
turned
it
over
several
times
and
then
abandoned
it
for
the
middle
sized
box
from
which
by
skillful
use
of
his
teeth
and
hands
he
quickly
tore
off
one
side
by
this
time
apparently
without
very
definitely
directed
effort
on
the
part
of
the
monkey
all
three
of
the
boxes
were
in
the
center
of
the
cage
and
almost
directly
beneath
the
banana
skirrl
climbed
up
on
the
largest
box
and
made
efforts
to
pull
the
middle
sized
one
up
on
to
it
the
while
looking
at
the
banana
every
few
seconds
he
did
not
succeed
in
getting
the
boxes
properly
placed
and
after
a
time
began
moving
them
about
restlessly
his
behavior
plainly
indicated
that
hunger
was
not
his
chief
motive
he
was
more
interested
in
playing
with
things
or
in
working
with
them
than
in
eating
and
the
satisfaction
of
tearing
a
box
to
pieces
seemed
even
greater
than
that
of
food
it
is
especially
noteworthy
that
when
skirrl
attempts
to
dismember
a
box
instead
of
starting
at
random
he
searches
carefully
for
a
favorable
starting
point
a
place
where
a
board
is
slightly
loosened
or
where
a
slight
crack
or
hole
enables
him
to
insert
his
hand
or
use
his
teeth
effectively
many
times
during
this
experiment
he
was
observed
to
examine
the
boxes
on
all
sides
in
search
of
some
weak
point
if
no
such
weak
point
were
found
he
shortly
left
the
box
but
if
he
did
find
a
favorable
spot
he
usually
succeeded
before
he
gave
up
the
attempt
in
doing
considerable
damage
to
the
box
following
the
behavior
described
above
skirrl
returned
to
the
middle
sized
box
placed
it
on
end
under
the
banana
mounted
and
looked
upward
at
the
bait
but
as
it
was
a
few
inches
beyond
his
reach
he
made
no
attempt
to
get
it
but
instead
after
a
few
seconds
went
to
the
smallest
box
and
finding
a
weak
point
began
to
tear
it
to
pieces
later
he
rolled
what
was
left
of
the
smallest
box
close
to
the
other
two
boxes
nearly
under
the
banana
and
the
remainder
of
his
time
was
spent
gnawing
at
the
boxes
and
playing
with
pieces
which
he
had
succeeded
in
tearing
from
them
during
the
remainder
of
the
thirty
minute
interval
of
observation
no
further
attention
was
given
the
bait
again
on
august
the
test
was
tried
but
this
time
with
boxes
whose
edges
had
been
bound
with
tin
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
monkey
to
destroy
them
he
spent
several
minutes
searching
for
a
starting
point
on
the
middle
sized
box
but
finding
none
he
dragged
it
under
the
banana
looked
up
mounted
the
box
but
as
previously
did
not
reach
for
the
bait
because
it
was
beyond
his
reach
he
then
played
with
the
boxes
for
several
minutes
finally
he
worked
the
two
smaller
boxes
to
a
position
directly
under
the
banana
put
the
middle
sized
one
on
end
mounted
it
and
looked
at
the
bait
but
again
abandoned
the
attempt
without
reaching
during
the
thirty
minutes
of
observation
he
made
no
definite
effort
to
place
one
box
upon
another
three
times
he
mounted
one
or
another
of
the
boxes
when
it
was
under
the
banana
or
nearly
so
but
in
no
case
was
it
possible
for
him
to
reach
the
bait
from
the
above
description
of
this
monkey
behavior
it
seems
fairly
certain
that
with
sufficient
opportunity
under
strong
hunger
he
would
ultimately
succeed
in
obtaining
the
bait
by
the
use
of
two
or
more
boxes
for
his
somewhat
abortive
and
never
long
continued
efforts
to
drag
two
boxes
together
or
to
place
the
one
upon
the
other
clearly
enough
indicate
a
tendency
which
would
ultimately
yield
success
the
possibility
of
imitation
is
not
excluded
for
skirrl
had
opportunities
to
see
julius
and
the
experimenter
handle
the
boxes
because
of
the
other
work
which
seemed
more
important
at
the
time
this
experiment
was
not
continued
further
the
results
obtained
suggest
the
desirability
of
testing
thoroughly
the
ability
of
monkeys
to
use
objects
as
only
the
anthropoid
apes
and
man
have
heretofore
been
thought
capable
of
using
them
and
pole
skirrl
was
first
tested
with
the
box
and
pole
experiment
on
august
as
in
the
case
of
julius
a
half
banana
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
long
box
and
the
attention
of
the
monkey
was
attracted
to
the
bait
by
small
pieces
of
carrot
placed
near
each
open
end
two
poles
were
placed
near
the
box
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
when
admitted
to
the
cage
skirrl
went
almost
directly
to
the
ends
of
the
box
took
the
pieces
of
carrot
which
were
in
sight
but
apparently
failed
to
perceive
the
bait
in
the
middle
of
the
box
for
a
while
he
played
with
the
locks
on
the
box
shoved
it
about
and
amused
himself
with
it
showing
no
interest
in
obtaining
the
food
later
he
looked
through
the
box
and
saw
the
banana
he
then
dragged
the
box
about
apparently
trying
to
get
it
into
his
cage
but
he
gave
no
attention
to
the
poles
nor
did
he
make
any
evident
effort
to
obtain
the
banana
which
was
easily
visible
in
the
center
of
the
box
the
period
of
observation
was
only
twelve
minutes
on
august
this
experiment
was
repeated
with
an
important
modification
of
the
apparatus
in
that
the
wooden
lid
of
the
long
box
had
been
replaced
by
a
wire
cover
through
which
the
animal
could
see
the
bait
two
poles
were
as
formerly
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
not
far
from
the
box
skirrl
almost
immediately
noticed
the
banana
and
tried
to
get
it
by
gnawing
at
the
box
he
did
not
once
reach
in
at
the
ends
of
the
box
but
he
did
handle
the
poles
throwing
them
about
and
pounding
with
them
there
was
not
the
slightest
attempt
to
use
them
in
obtaining
the
bait
this
experiment
was
later
repeated
three
times
at
intervals
of
a
number
of
days
but
in
no
case
did
skirrl
show
any
tendency
to
use
the
poles
as
means
of
obtaining
the
food
this
also
was
arranged
in
the
same
manner
as
for
julius
and
on
each
of
five
days
skirrl
was
allowed
at
least
thirty
minutes
to
work
for
the
bait
either
a
banana
or
a
carrot
was
each
day
placed
on
the
board
well
beyond
his
reach
and
one
or
two
usually
two
small
sticks
were
put
into
his
cage
not
once
during
the
several
periods
of
observation
did
skirrl
make
any
attempt
to
use
a
stick
or
any
other
object
as
a
means
of
drawing
the
food
to
him
instead
he
reached
persistently
with
his
arm
pulled
and
gnawed
at
the
wires
which
were
in
his
way
and
occasionally
picked
up
and
gnawed
or
pounded
with
the
sticks
in
the
cage
his
attention
every
now
and
then
would
come
back
to
the
food
but
it
tended
to
fluctuate
rather
rapidly
and
in
the
regular
period
of
observation
thirty
minutes
it
is
unlikely
that
he
attended
to
the
bait
itself
for
as
much
as
five
minutes
in
this
respect
as
well
as
many
others
skirrl
behavior
contrasts
sharply
with
that
of
the
orang
utan
the
results
of
this
experiment
indicate
the
lack
in
the
monkey
of
any
tendency
or
ability
apart
from
training
to
use
objects
as
means
of
obtaining
food
ways
of
using
objects
as
tools
which
apparently
are
perfectly
natural
to
the
anthropoid
apes
and
to
man
are
rarely
employed
by
the
lower
primates
and
nail
one
day
i
happened
to
observe
skirrl
playing
with
a
staple
in
his
cage
he
had
found
it
on
the
floor
where
it
had
fallen
and
was
intently
prodding
himself
with
the
sharp
points
apparently
enjoying
the
unusual
sensations
which
he
got
from
sticking
the
staple
into
the
skin
in
various
portions
of
his
body
and
especially
into
the
prepuce
a
few
days
later
i
saw
him
playing
in
similar
fashion
with
a
nail
which
he
had
found
and
still
later
he
was
seen
to
be
using
a
stick
to
pound
the
nail
with
this
suggested
to
me
the
hammer
and
nail
test
a
heavy
spike
was
driven
into
an
old
hammer
to
serve
as
an
indestructible
handle
this
hammer
along
with
a
number
of
large
wire
nails
and
a
piece
of
redwood
board
was
then
placed
in
the
cage
skirrl
immediately
took
up
the
hammer
grasping
the
middle
of
the
handle
with
his
left
hand
and
with
his
right
hand
taking
up
a
nail
he
then
sat
down
on
the
board
examined
the
nail
placed
the
pointed
end
on
the
board
and
with
well
directed
strokes
by
the
use
of
the
head
of
the
hammer
drove
the
nail
into
the
board
for
the
distance
of
at
least
an
inch
he
then
tried
to
pull
it
out
but
was
forced
to
knock
it
several
times
with
the
hammer
before
he
could
do
so
this
performance
during
the
next
few
minutes
was
repeated
several
times
with
variations
often
the
side
of
the
hammer
was
used
instead
of
the
head
and
occasionally
as
is
shown
in
figure
of
plate
ii
he
seized
the
hammer
well
up
toward
the
juncture
of
the
same
with
the
spike
this
figure
does
justice
to
the
performance
at
the
moment
the
picture
was
taken
skirrl
attention
had
been
attracted
by
a
monkey
in
an
adjoining
cage
and
he
had
momentarily
looked
up
from
his
task
the
while
holding
nail
and
hammer
perfectly
still
this
test
was
repeated
on
various
days
and
almost
uniformly
skirrl
showed
intense
interest
in
hammer
and
nails
and
used
them
more
or
less
persistently
in
the
manner
described
occasionally
apparently
for
the
sake
of
variety
he
would
put
the
blunt
end
of
the
nail
on
the
board
and
hammer
on
the
point
again
he
would
try
persistently
to
drive
the
nail
into
the
cement
floor
and
once
by
accident
when
hammer
and
nails
were
left
in
his
cage
over
night
he
succeeded
in
making
several
holes
in
the
bottom
of
his
sheet
iron
water
pan
there
was
no
doubting
the
keen
satisfaction
which
the
animal
took
in
this
form
of
activity
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
the
behavior
was
not
imitative
of
man
for
skirrl
along
with
all
of
the
other
monkeys
had
had
abundant
opportunity
to
see
carpenters
working
but
this
much
can
be
said
against
the
idea
of
imitation
no
one
of
the
other
animals
not
excepting
the
orang
utan
showed
any
interest
whatever
in
hammer
and
nails
occasionally
they
would
be
played
with
momentarily
or
pushed
about
but
sobke
jimmie
gertie
julius
although
given
several
opportunities
to
exhibit
any
ability
which
they
might
have
to
drive
nails
made
not
the
least
attempt
to
do
so
evidently
we
must
either
conclude
that
skirrl
had
a
peculiarly
strong
imitative
tendency
in
this
direction
or
instead
a
pronounced
disposition
or
instinct
for
the
use
of
objects
as
tools
it
would
seem
fair
to
speak
of
it
as
an
instinct
for
mechanical
activity
under
this
same
heading
may
be
described
skirrl
reactions
to
such
objects
as
a
handsaw
a
padlock
and
a
water
faucet
the
saw
was
given
to
him
in
order
to
test
his
ability
to
use
it
in
human
fashion
for
if
he
could
so
expertly
imitate
the
carpenter
driving
nails
it
seems
likely
that
he
might
also
imitate
the
use
of
the
saw
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
showed
no
tendency
to
use
the
saw
as
we
do
instead
he
persistently
played
with
it
in
various
ways
at
first
using
it
as
a
sort
of
plane
to
scrape
with
later
often
rubbing
the
teeth
over
a
board
so
that
they
cut
fairly
well
but
never
as
effectively
as
in
the
hands
of
a
man
after
two
or
three
days
practice
with
the
saw
skirrl
hit
upon
a
method
which
is
as
i
understand
used
by
man
in
certain
countries
namely
that
of
placing
the
saw
with
the
teeth
up
holding
it
rigid
and
then
rubbing
the
object
which
is
to
be
sawed
over
it
this
skirrl
succeeded
in
doing
very
skillfully
for
he
would
sit
down
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
grip
with
both
feet
the
handle
of
the
saw
with
the
teeth
directed
upward
then
holding
either
end
in
his
hands
he
would
repeatedly
rub
a
stick
over
the
teeth
in
this
way
of
course
he
could
make
the
saw
cut
fairly
well
but
still
more
to
his
liking
was
the
use
of
a
spike
instead
of
a
stick
as
an
object
to
rub
over
the
teeth
for
with
this
he
was
able
to
make
a
noise
that
would
have
satisfied
even
a
small
boy
further
light
is
shed
on
the
force
of
the
tendency
to
imitate
man
by
the
saw
test
after
skirrl
had
been
given
an
opportunity
to
show
what
he
could
do
with
the
tool
spontaneously
i
demonstrated
to
him
the
approved
human
way
of
sawing
often
he
would
watch
my
performance
intently
as
though
fascinated
by
the
sound
and
motion
but
when
given
the
tool
he
invariably
followed
his
own
methods
although
i
repeated
this
test
of
imitation
several
times
on
three
different
days
the
results
were
wholly
negative
one
day
as
skirrl
was
being
returned
to
his
own
cage
by
way
of
the
larger
cage
he
picked
up
an
unfastened
padlock
and
carried
it
into
the
cage
with
him
for
more
than
an
hour
he
amused
himself
almost
without
interruption
by
playing
with
this
lock
the
things
which
he
did
with
it
during
that
time
would
require
pages
to
describe
his
interest
in
it
was
very
similar
to
that
which
he
had
exhibited
in
hammer
and
nails
saw
and
indeed
any
objects
which
he
could
play
with
the
lock
was
pounded
in
various
ways
bitten
poked
with
nails
hooked
into
the
wires
of
the
cage
used
to
pull
on
pounded
with
a
stick
used
to
hammer
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
with
and
in
fine
manipulated
in
quite
as
great
a
variety
of
ways
as
a
human
being
could
have
discovered
finally
it
was
hooked
to
the
side
of
the
cage
and
snapped
shut
and
as
skirrl
was
unable
to
dislodge
it
from
this
position
he
shortly
gave
up
playing
with
it
at
the
end
of
the
large
cage
and
just
outside
the
wire
netting
was
a
faucet
to
which
a
hose
was
usually
attached
the
valve
could
be
opened
by
turning
a
hand
piece
both
skirrl
and
julius
learned
to
turn
this
wheel
in
order
to
get
water
to
play
with
but
usually
the
former
strength
was
not
sufficient
to
turn
on
the
water
the
latter
could
do
it
readily
the
indications
are
that
both
animals
profited
by
seeing
human
beings
turn
on
the
water
this
unquestionably
attracted
their
attention
to
the
faucet
and
probably
by
playing
with
it
they
accidentally
happened
upon
the
proper
movement
at
any
rate
behavior
was
significant
in
this
connection
for
he
would
pick
up
the
hose
to
see
if
water
were
flowing
and
if
it
were
not
he
would
throw
it
down
go
directly
to
the
faucet
and
try
to
turn
the
wheel
the
association
of
the
wheel
with
the
desired
flow
of
water
was
therefore
definitely
established
shall
we
describe
the
act
as
ideational
it
seems
the
natural
thing
to
do
sobke
stacking
for
this
test
in
the
case
of
sobke
three
light
boxes
made
of
redwood
about
of
an
inch
thick
were
used
the
smallest
box
was
six
inches
in
each
direction
the
next
larger
box
was
twelve
inches
and
the
third
box
eighteen
inches
as
in
the
case
of
the
other
animals
bait
either
banana
or
carrot
was
suspended
from
the
middle
of
the
roof
of
the
large
cage
at
such
distance
from
the
floor
as
to
be
reached
by
the
animal
only
by
the
use
of
the
boxes
the
first
observations
on
sobke
were
made
on
june
the
three
boxes
had
been
placed
in
the
form
of
a
pyramid
directly
under
the
banana
which
hung
about
eighteen
inches
above
the
uppermost
box
attention
while
in
his
cage
had
been
attracted
to
the
bait
by
seeing
me
fastening
it
in
position
but
when
admitted
to
the
large
cage
he
simply
glanced
at
it
and
then
wandered
about
the
cage
picking
up
bits
of
food
and
struggling
to
get
at
the
other
monkeys
this
he
did
for
about
five
minutes
he
then
went
to
the
boxes
placed
his
hands
on
top
of
the
bottom
one
but
did
not
climb
up
on
it
a
few
minutes
later
he
returned
to
the
box
again
climbed
up
and
readily
reached
the
food
which
he
ate
while
resting
on
boxes
and
i
now
replaced
the
bait
and
gave
the
monkey
a
second
chance
to
obtain
it
almost
immediately
he
climbed
up
as
far
as
the
second
box
but
although
he
could
reach
the
banana
only
from
the
uppermost
box
he
deliberately
shoved
it
off
to
the
ground
and
sat
down
upon
box
as
he
was
unable
to
obtain
the
banana
from
this
he
soon
began
to
gnaw
and
pull
at
it
and
as
he
was
succeeding
all
too
well
in
his
efforts
to
tear
the
box
to
pieces
he
had
to
be
returned
to
his
cage
the
most
important
features
of
his
behavior
were
first
his
stealthy
and
indirect
manner
and
second
his
failure
to
use
other
means
of
obtaining
the
bait
than
that
supplied
by
the
observer
instead
of
looking
straight
at
the
experimenter
or
at
the
object
which
he
wished
to
obtain
he
apparently
looked
and
attended
elsewhere
for
this
reason
it
was
often
difficult
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
had
noticed
the
bait
or
the
boxes
finally
i
was
led
to
conclude
that
he
usually
knew
exactly
what
was
going
on
and
had
in
his
furtive
way
noted
all
of
the
essential
features
of
the
situation
and
that
his
manner
was
extremely
indicative
of
his
mental
attitude
of
limited
trust
both
julius
and
skirrl
went
to
the
opposite
extreme
in
the
matter
of
directness
or
as
we
should
say
in
human
relations
frankness
they
would
look
the
experimenter
directly
in
the
eye
and
they
usually
gazed
intently
at
anything
such
for
example
as
the
bait
that
interested
them
sobke
even
when
very
hungry
instead
of
going
directly
toward
the
bait
and
trying
to
obtain
it
usually
did
various
other
things
as
though
pretending
that
he
had
no
interest
in
food
on
the
following
day
june
the
three
boxes
were
again
placed
nearly
under
the
banana
but
this
time
the
two
smaller
boxes
numbers
and
were
pushed
to
the
extreme
end
of
the
lower
box
and
so
far
from
the
bait
that
it
could
not
be
reached
from
box
it
was
necessary
then
for
the
animal
to
push
boxes
and
along
on
box
until
they
were
nearer
the
bait
sobke
when
admitted
to
the
cage
evidently
noticed
the
banana
but
as
formerly
he
made
no
immediate
effort
to
obtain
it
after
wandering
in
search
of
food
and
quarreling
with
the
other
monkeys
for
several
minutes
he
went
to
the
boxes
pushed
the
topmost
one
number
off
on
to
the
floor
and
then
carried
it
into
his
cage
where
he
quickly
tore
one
side
off
he
next
returned
to
the
large
cage
climbed
up
on
box
and
he
was
able
by
jumping
to
reach
and
obtain
the
banana
as
sobke
was
very
good
at
jumping
his
new
method
rendered
the
box
stacking
experiment
of
uncertain
value
since
it
was
next
to
impossible
so
to
arrange
the
spatial
relations
of
bait
and
boxes
that
he
should
be
neither
discouraged
by
too
great
a
distance
nor
encouraged
to
jump
by
too
small
a
distance
evidently
it
would
be
more
satisfactory
to
simplify
the
conditions
by
trying
to
discover
first
of
all
whether
he
would
use
a
single
box
as
a
means
of
reaching
the
reward
in
pursuance
of
this
idea
i
suspended
a
piece
of
bread
five
feet
from
the
floor
of
the
cage
and
a
few
feet
to
one
side
of
it
i
placed
a
box
from
which
it
could
be
reached
or
at
least
easily
seized
by
jumping
sobke
shortly
walked
to
a
point
beneath
the
bait
and
leaping
into
the
air
seized
it
i
then
replaced
the
bait
raising
it
to
a
height
of
five
feet
ten
inches
from
the
floor
of
the
cage
when
i
had
retired
sobke
placed
himself
in
the
proper
position
beneath
looked
up
at
it
but
went
away
without
jumping
for
it
during
the
remaining
ten
minutes
of
observation
he
paid
no
further
attention
to
the
bait
having
satisfied
himself
evidently
that
it
was
beyond
his
reach
my
use
of
this
test
was
concluded
on
june
when
once
more
i
suspended
a
piece
of
bread
six
feet
from
the
floor
and
placed
a
few
feet
to
one
side
the
eighteen
inch
box
number
from
which
had
the
monkey
pushed
it
to
a
point
directly
under
the
bread
he
could
have
obtained
the
food
easily
sobke
noticed
the
food
promptly
and
from
time
to
time
as
he
wandered
about
he
glanced
at
it
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
but
not
once
did
he
sit
down
and
look
at
it
steadily
and
directly
as
julius
and
skirrl
might
have
done
in
the
first
twenty
minutes
of
observation
the
monkey
made
no
attempt
either
to
use
the
box
or
to
reach
the
food
by
jumping
i
then
placed
the
box
directly
under
the
bait
and
scarcely
had
i
withdrawn
from
the
cage
before
sobke
climbed
up
on
it
and
looked
toward
the
food
he
could
not
reach
it
without
jumping
and
he
made
no
effort
to
get
it
i
had
left
a
second
box
in
the
cage
one
which
i
had
been
using
as
a
seat
sobke
now
went
to
this
box
placed
his
hands
on
it
looked
toward
the
bait
and
then
went
to
a
distant
part
of
the
cage
no
further
indications
were
obtained
during
the
remainder
of
the
period
of
observation
of
interest
in
the
boxes
as
possible
means
of
obtaining
the
desired
food
it
is
of
course
obvious
that
this
experiment
was
not
long
enough
continued
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
either
sobke
or
skirrl
could
not
use
the
boxes
or
even
learn
to
place
one
box
upon
another
in
order
to
obtain
the
bait
the
experiment
like
several
others
which
are
being
described
briefly
was
used
to
supplement
the
experiment
and
the
experimenter
chief
interest
was
to
discover
the
number
and
variety
of
methods
which
would
be
used
by
the
animal
in
the
first
few
presentations
of
a
situation
it
is
practically
certain
that
both
of
these
monkeys
would
have
succeeded
ultimately
in
solving
the
problem
of
obtaining
the
food
had
they
been
left
in
the
cage
with
a
number
of
boxes
for
skirrl
very
early
indicated
interest
in
moving
the
boxes
about
and
sobke
showed
a
tendency
in
that
direction
which
perhaps
was
inhibited
partially
by
his
distrust
of
the
experimenter
for
sobke
as
for
julius
and
skirrl
the
test
was
made
by
putting
food
on
a
shelf
outside
the
cage
beyond
the
reach
of
the
animal
and
placing
in
the
cage
with
the
animal
one
or
two
sticks
long
enough
to
be
used
for
drawing
in
the
bait
sobke
was
first
given
this
test
on
july
he
tried
persistently
to
reach
the
banana
with
his
hand
seized
the
box
which
supported
the
bait
shook
it
picked
up
one
or
other
of
the
sticks
and
chewed
at
it
repeatedly
but
not
once
did
he
make
any
move
to
use
a
stick
to
draw
the
food
toward
him
this
experiment
was
repeated
on
july
and
a
period
of
thirty
minutes
being
allowed
on
each
day
for
observation
at
no
time
did
sobke
show
any
inclination
to
use
either
a
stick
or
any
other
object
as
a
means
of
reaching
the
bait
instead
he
confined
himself
strictly
to
the
use
of
hands
and
teeth
this
test
makes
it
fairly
certain
that
sobke
had
no
natural
tendency
to
use
objects
as
tools
in
so
far
as
he
attended
to
things
about
the
cage
or
laboratory
it
seemed
to
be
rather
to
play
with
them
in
a
general
way
than
to
use
them
ideationally
or
otherwise
for
definite
purposes
the
definitely
negative
result
of
the
experiment
rendered
needless
prolonged
observation
with
the
box
and
pole
test
whose
results
are
now
to
be
presented
and
pole
the
inch
box
previously
used
for
a
similar
test
with
julius
was
presented
to
sobke
on
august
the
wooden
cover
having
been
replaced
by
a
wire
one
so
that
the
monkey
could
readily
see
the
bait
in
the
middle
of
the
box
sobke
when
admitted
to
the
large
cage
went
directly
to
the
box
and
at
once
discovered
the
banana
which
was
midway
between
the
ends
he
evidently
desired
it
shortly
he
went
to
one
end
of
the
box
and
looked
in
this
he
repeated
later
he
also
shook
the
box
and
tried
to
pull
it
about
and
tear
it
with
his
teeth
but
to
the
two
poles
lying
nearby
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
he
gave
not
the
slightest
attention
during
a
thirty
minute
period
of
observation
the
experiment
was
not
repeated
because
of
more
important
work
in
more
respects
than
i
have
taken
time
to
enumerate
in
the
above
descriptions
of
behavior
the
relations
of
sobke
to
objects
differed
from
those
of
skirrl
and
still
more
from
those
of
julius
hammer
nails
saw
stones
sticks
locks
and
various
other
objects
received
relatively
little
attention
from
sobke
unless
they
happened
to
come
in
his
way
then
they
were
usually
pushed
aside
with
but
scant
notice
rarely
he
would
carry
something
to
the
shelf
of
his
cage
with
him
but
as
a
rule
only
to
lay
it
down
and
attend
to
something
else
skirrl
on
the
contrary
attended
persistently
to
anything
new
in
the
shape
of
a
movable
object
he
was
extremely
partial
to
objects
which
could
be
manipulated
by
him
in
various
ways
and
especially
to
any
thing
with
which
he
could
make
a
noise
his
interest
in
hammer
and
nails
saw
locks
seemed
never
to
wane
i
have
seen
him
play
for
an
hour
almost
uninterruptedly
with
a
hammer
and
a
nail
or
even
with
a
big
spike
which
he
could
use
to
pry
about
his
cage
in
the
absence
of
anything
more
interesting
even
a
staple
or
a
small
nail
might
receive
his
undivided
attention
for
minutes
at
a
time
how
important
is
the
species
difference
in
this
connection
i
have
no
means
to
judge
but
if
we
may
not
consider
these
different
modes
of
behavior
characteristic
of
as
contrasted
with
we
must
conclude
that
remarkable
individual
differences
exist
among
monkeys
for
whereas
skirrl
is
by
nature
a
mechanical
genius
sobke
has
apparently
no
such
disposition
i
can
imagine
no
more
fascinating
task
than
the
careful
analytical
study
of
the
temperaments
of
these
two
animals
behavior
has
importantly
modified
my
conception
of
genius
v
miscellaneous
observations
and
several
years
ago
doctor
hamilton
reported
to
me
observations
which
he
had
made
on
preference
for
the
right
or
left
paw
in
dogs
he
has
not
i
believe
published
an
account
of
his
work
subsequently
franz
observed
a
similar
preference
in
monkeys
which
according
to
his
report
exhibit
marked
tendency
to
be
or
ambidextrous
my
own
observations
although
they
are
wholly
incidental
to
my
other
work
seem
worthy
of
description
at
this
point
i
noted
first
of
all
that
the
orang
utan
julius
tended
to
use
his
left
hand
he
by
no
means
limited
himself
to
this
but
in
difficult
situations
he
almost
invariably
reached
for
food
or
manipulated
objects
in
connection
with
food
getting
with
the
left
hand
figures
and
of
plate
v
show
him
reaching
for
a
banana
with
the
left
hand
likewise
figure
exhibits
the
use
of
the
left
hand
in
the
experiment
so
marked
was
julius
preference
for
his
left
hand
that
i
became
interested
in
observing
similar
phenomena
in
the
monkeys
skirrl
when
driving
nails
held
the
hammer
with
his
left
hand
and
the
nail
with
his
right
hand
the
fact
that
he
never
was
observed
to
reverse
the
use
of
the
hands
is
surprising
for
other
observations
indicate
that
he
preferred
the
right
hand
for
certain
acts
stimulated
by
the
obvious
in
certain
connections
of
julius
and
skirrl
i
tested
the
preference
of
several
of
the
monkeys
in
the
following
simple
way
standing
outside
the
cage
i
would
hold
out
a
peanut
to
a
hungry
animal
keeping
it
so
far
from
the
cage
that
the
monkey
could
barely
reach
it
with
its
fingers
i
noted
the
hand
which
was
used
to
grasp
the
food
next
i
varied
the
procedure
by
placing
the
peanut
on
a
board
in
order
to
make
sure
that
i
was
not
definitely
directing
the
animal
attention
with
sobke
the
following
results
were
obtained
in
forty
trials
given
on
two
different
days
he
reached
for
and
obtained
the
food
each
time
with
his
left
hand
only
by
holding
the
bait
well
toward
the
right
side
of
his
body
was
it
possible
to
induce
him
to
use
the
right
hand
so
far
as
may
be
judged
from
these
observations
and
from
others
in
connection
with
the
experiments
this
animal
is
definitely
with
skirrl
the
results
are
strikingly
different
as
stated
above
he
used
the
hammer
consistently
with
his
left
hand
but
in
twenty
attempts
to
obtain
food
by
reaching
he
used
his
right
hand
seventeen
times
and
his
left
only
three
times
it
was
quite
as
difficult
to
induce
him
to
use
his
left
hand
for
this
purpose
as
it
was
to
induce
sobke
to
use
his
right
we
must
therefore
conclude
that
skirrl
is
in
connection
with
certain
movements
and
in
others
the
monkey
named
gertie
in
the
reaching
experiment
consistently
used
her
left
hand
never
once
using
the
right
jimmie
so
far
as
it
was
possible
to
make
tests
with
him
also
used
his
left
hand
but
it
should
be
said
that
the
results
are
unsatisfactory
because
he
was
at
the
time
extremely
pugnacious
and
paid
attention
to
the
experimenter
rather
than
to
the
food
scotty
in
the
first
series
of
ten
trials
used
his
right
hand
eight
times
his
left
twice
in
the
second
series
given
the
following
day
he
used
the
right
hand
three
times
and
the
left
seven
times
from
this
we
should
have
to
infer
that
he
is
ambidextrous
a
female
monkey
which
had
been
brought
to
the
laboratory
only
a
few
days
previously
showed
a
preference
for
the
right
hand
by
the
use
of
it
fourteen
times
to
six
in
connection
with
these
data
which
are
i
should
repeat
too
scanty
to
be
of
any
considerable
value
i
wish
to
describe
my
own
experience
although
naturally
i
am
by
training
to
the
extent
of
having
been
able
to
use
my
hands
in
writing
and
in
various
other
activities
equally
well
at
the
age
of
twelve
i
am
at
present
ambidextrous
in
that
there
are
many
things
which
i
do
with
equal
readiness
and
skill
with
either
hand
delicate
exact
and
finely
coordinated
movements
such
as
those
of
writing
and
using
surgical
instruments
i
perform
always
with
my
left
hand
while
grosser
movements
involving
the
whole
hand
or
arm
i
am
rather
likely
to
perform
with
my
right
hand
it
seems
not
improbable
in
the
light
of
my
own
experience
that
we
shall
find
some
specialization
among
the
lower
animals
with
respect
to
preference
for
right
and
left
hand
or
arm
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
to
discover
that
it
is
the
rule
for
animals
to
possess
or
to
develop
readily
definite
preference
for
one
hand
in
connection
with
a
given
act
of
skill
and
to
have
quite
as
definite
a
preference
for
the
other
hand
in
connection
with
a
radically
different
kind
of
act
and
of
the
many
presumably
instinctive
modes
of
behavior
which
were
observed
only
those
which
have
to
do
with
social
relations
seem
especially
worth
reporting
from
among
them
i
shall
select
for
description
a
few
which
have
already
been
referred
to
in
connection
with
the
experimental
observations
aspects
of
the
maternal
instinct
i
had
opportunity
to
observe
in
gertie
who
on
february
gave
birth
to
a
male
infant
i
present
below
the
substance
of
a
previously
published
note
on
her
behavior
yerkes
on
february
one
of
the
monkeys
of
our
collection
gave
birth
in
the
cages
at
montecito
to
a
male
infant
the
mother
is
a
cynomolgus
irus
who
has
been
described
by
hamilton
as
gertie
cynomolgus
irus
age
years
months
she
is
now
may
years
and
months
daughter
of
monkeys
and
first
pregnancy
began
september
the
result
of
this
pregnancy
was
i
am
informed
a
the
second
pregnancy
which
shall
now
especially
concern
us
resulted
likewise
in
a
parturition
occurred
saturday
night
and
the
writer
first
observed
the
behavior
of
the
mother
the
following
monday
morning
in
the
meantime
the
laboratory
attendant
had
obtained
the
data
upon
which
i
base
the
above
statements
at
the
time
of
parturition
gertie
was
in
a
by
by
foot
cage
containing
a
small
shelter
box
with
an
exceptionally
quiet
and
gentle
male
not
the
father
of
the
infant
who
is
designated
in
hamilton
paper
as
monkey
scotty
my
notes
record
the
following
exceptionally
interesting
and
genetically
important
behavior
on
march
when
i
approached
her
cage
gertie
was
sitting
on
the
floor
with
the
infant
held
in
one
hand
while
she
fingered
its
eyelids
and
eyes
with
the
other
scotty
sat
close
beside
her
watching
intently
when
disturbed
by
me
the
mother
carried
her
infant
to
a
shelf
at
the
top
of
the
cage
repeatedly
attempts
were
made
to
remove
the
dead
baby
but
they
were
futile
because
gertie
either
held
it
in
her
hands
or
sat
close
beside
it
ready
to
seize
it
at
the
slightest
disturbance
especially
noteworthy
on
this
the
second
day
after
the
birth
of
the
infant
are
the
male
as
well
as
the
female
keen
interest
in
the
body
and
their
frequent
examinations
of
the
eyes
as
if
in
attempts
to
open
them
often
also
the
mother
searched
the
body
for
fleas
observations
were
made
from
day
to
day
and
each
day
opportunity
was
sought
to
remove
the
body
without
seriously
frightening
or
exciting
the
female
no
such
opportunity
came
and
during
the
second
week
the
corpse
so
far
decomposed
that
with
constant
handling
and
licking
by
the
adults
it
rapidly
wore
away
by
the
third
week
there
remained
only
the
shriveled
skin
covering
a
few
fragments
of
bone
and
the
open
skull
from
the
cavity
of
which
the
brain
had
been
removed
this
the
mother
never
lost
sight
of
even
when
eating
she
either
held
it
in
one
hand
or
foot
or
laid
it
beside
her
within
easy
reach
gradually
this
remnant
became
still
further
reduced
until
on
march
there
existed
only
a
strip
of
dry
skin
about
four
inches
long
with
a
appendage
of
nearly
the
same
length
the
male
scotty
on
this
date
was
removed
to
another
cage
gertie
made
a
great
fuss
jumping
about
excitedly
and
uttering
plaintive
cries
when
she
discovered
that
her
mate
was
gone
whenever
i
approached
her
cage
she
scurried
into
the
shelter
box
and
stayed
there
while
i
was
near
this
behavior
i
never
before
had
observed
it
continued
for
two
days
on
april
it
was
noted
that
she
had
lost
her
recently
acquired
shyness
and
she
no
longer
made
any
attempts
to
avoid
me
as
usual
on
this
date
she
was
carrying
the
remnant
about
with
her
the
following
day
april
gertie
was
lured
from
her
cage
to
a
large
adjoining
compartment
for
certain
experimental
observations
after
she
had
been
returned
to
her
own
cage
the
remnant
was
noticed
on
the
floor
of
the
large
cage
i
picked
it
up
gertie
evidently
noticed
my
act
for
although
at
a
distance
of
at
least
ten
feet
from
me
she
made
a
sharp
outcry
and
sprang
to
the
side
of
the
cage
nearest
me
i
held
the
piece
of
skin
it
looked
more
like
a
bit
of
rat
skin
than
the
remains
of
a
monkey
out
to
her
and
she
immediately
seized
it
and
rushed
with
it
to
the
shelf
at
the
top
of
the
cage
two
days
later
the
remnant
was
missing
and
careful
search
failed
to
discover
it
in
the
cage
it
is
probable
that
gertie
had
carelessly
left
it
lying
on
the
floor
whence
it
was
washed
out
when
the
cages
were
cleaned
on
this
date
gertie
seemed
quieter
than
for
weeks
previously
thus
it
appears
that
during
a
period
of
five
weeks
the
instinct
to
protect
her
offspring
impelled
this
monkey
to
carry
its
gradually
vanishing
remains
about
with
her
and
to
watch
over
them
so
assiduously
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
take
them
from
her
except
by
force
after
reading
this
note
in
manuscript
doctor
hamilton
informed
me
that
gertie
had
behaved
toward
her
first
as
toward
her
second
and
further
that
grace
a
baboon
also
carried
a
about
for
weeks
i
am
now
heartily
glad
that
my
early
efforts
to
remove
the
corpse
were
futile
for
this
record
of
the
persistence
of
maternal
behavior
seems
to
me
of
very
unusual
interest
to
the
genetic
psychologist
in
connection
with
the
experiments
skirrl
exhibited
what
seemed
to
be
instinctive
fear
as
a
result
of
his
unfortunate
experience
with
nails
in
the
floor
of
box
he
seemingly
referred
his
misadventure
to
some
unseen
enemy
under
the
floor
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
given
abundant
opportunity
to
examine
the
floor
of
the
box
but
not
until
after
the
dangerous
nails
had
been
clinched
his
long
continued
avoidance
of
the
experiment
boxes
and
his
still
more
persistent
hesitancy
in
entering
them
coupled
with
his
almost
ludicrous
efforts
to
see
beneath
the
floor
through
the
holes
cut
for
the
staples
on
the
doors
gave
me
the
impression
of
superstitious
fear
of
the
unseen
as
i
watched
and
recorded
his
behavior
day
after
day
during
the
period
of
most
pronounced
fear
i
could
not
avoid
the
thought
that
the
instinctive
fear
of
snakes
had
something
to
do
with
his
peculiar
actions
and
although
i
have
never
studied
either
the
natural
or
the
acquired
responses
of
monkeys
to
snakes
i
suspect
that
lacking
such
instinctive
equipment
skirrl
would
have
behaved
differently
as
a
result
of
the
pricks
which
he
received
from
the
nails
it
is
needless
to
redescribe
his
acquired
fear
of
whiteness
as
it
manifested
itself
in
the
freshly
painted
apparatus
accompanying
these
instructive
modes
of
response
and
their
emotions
are
suggestions
of
peculiarly
interesting
problems
as
well
as
of
modes
of
attacking
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
skirrl
did
much
to
alter
my
conception
of
the
constitution
of
his
mind
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
by
the
features
of
behavior
exhibited
but
i
was
by
no
means
prepared
for
their
persistence
and
for
the
highly
emotional
attitude
toward
the
particular
situation
only
an
organism
of
complexly
constituted
nervous
system
and
fairly
highly
developed
affective
life
could
be
expected
to
respond
as
did
this
monkey
as
has
been
suggested
above
i
find
the
appeal
to
instinct
modified
by
experience
a
natural
mode
of
accounting
for
the
unexpected
features
of
skirrl
behavior
the
instinctive
playfulness
of
the
young
monkey
tiny
contrasted
most
strikingly
with
the
more
serious
if
not
more
sedate
modes
of
behavior
of
the
older
individuals
during
the
greater
part
of
my
period
of
observation
tiny
was
of
scotty
the
most
calm
and
apparently
lazy
of
all
the
monkeys
tiny
delighted
in
teasing
scotty
and
her
varied
modes
of
mildly
tormenting
him
and
of
stirring
him
to
pursuit
or
to
retaliation
were
as
interesting
as
they
were
amusing
her
most
common
trick
was
to
steal
up
behind
him
and
pull
the
hair
of
his
back
or
seize
his
tail
with
her
hands
or
teeth
often
when
he
was
asleep
she
would
suddenly
run
to
him
give
a
sudden
jerk
at
a
handful
of
hairs
and
leap
away
he
was
surprisingly
patient
and
i
never
saw
him
treat
her
roughly
in
retaliation
another
of
tiny
favorite
forms
of
amusement
was
that
of
trying
to
stir
up
the
other
monkeys
to
attacks
on
one
another
she
very
cleverly
did
this
by
pretending
that
she
herself
was
being
attacked
the
instant
the
older
animals
began
to
show
hostility
toward
one
another
she
would
leap
out
of
the
way
and
watch
the
disturbance
with
evident
satisfaction
it
was
this
mode
of
behavior
in
the
little
animal
which
ultimately
provided
opportunity
for
the
observations
which
i
wish
now
to
report
as
indicative
of
sympathetic
possibly
i
may
say
altruistic
emotions
tiny
was
confined
with
scotty
in
a
cage
adjoining
the
one
in
which
jimmie
and
gertie
were
being
kept
the
cages
were
separated
by
wire
netting
of
mesh
one
morning
as
i
was
watching
the
behavior
of
the
animals
in
the
several
cages
i
noticed
tiny
dressing
with
her
teeth
a
wounded
finger
it
had
evidently
been
bitten
by
one
of
the
other
animals
in
all
probability
either
by
jimmie
or
gertie
tiny
was
trimming
away
the
loose
bits
of
skin
very
neatly
and
cleansing
the
wound
after
working
at
this
task
for
a
few
minutes
she
quickly
climbed
up
to
the
shelf
near
the
top
of
her
cage
and
by
rushing
to
the
partition
wire
between
the
two
cages
she
lured
gertie
to
an
attempted
attack
on
her
gertie
sprang
up
to
the
partition
placed
her
hands
on
it
with
the
fingers
projecting
through
the
meshes
and
attempted
to
seize
tiny
fingers
with
her
teeth
but
the
latter
was
too
quick
for
her
and
withdrawing
her
hands
like
a
flash
seized
in
her
teeth
the
middle
finger
of
gertie
left
hand
she
then
bit
it
severely
and
with
all
her
might
at
the
same
time
pulling
and
twisting
violently
often
placing
the
entire
weight
of
her
body
on
the
finger
her
sharp
teeth
cut
to
the
bone
and
it
was
impossible
for
the
larger
and
stronger
monkey
to
tear
away
for
several
seconds
this
continued
then
gertie
succeeded
in
escaping
whereupon
she
at
once
retreated
to
the
opposite
end
of
her
shelf
and
proceeded
to
attend
to
her
injured
finger
she
cried
wrung
her
hands
and
from
time
to
time
placed
the
finger
in
her
mouth
as
though
in
an
effort
to
relieve
the
pain
by
this
time
jimmie
attention
had
been
attracted
by
the
disturbance
and
he
rushed
up
to
the
shelf
and
facing
gertie
watched
her
intently
for
a
few
seconds
the
look
of
puzzled
concern
on
his
face
was
most
amusing
apparently
he
felt
dimly
that
something
in
which
he
should
have
intelligent
interest
was
going
on
but
was
unable
wholly
to
understand
the
situation
after
watching
gertie
for
a
time
and
trying
to
discover
what
she
was
doing
which
was
rendered
difficult
by
her
tendency
to
turn
away
from
him
in
order
to
shield
her
injured
finger
he
rushed
over
to
the
wire
partition
and
made
strenuous
efforts
to
seize
tiny
with
his
hands
and
teeth
but
although
she
continued
close
to
the
partition
and
often
crowded
against
it
with
face
and
hands
flattened
on
the
wires
he
was
not
able
to
get
hold
of
her
and
after
a
few
vain
attempts
he
returned
to
his
mate
and
again
with
evident
solicitousness
and
the
most
troubled
expression
watched
her
wringing
her
hands
and
chewing
or
sucking
at
her
injured
finger
shortly
he
again
returned
to
the
partition
and
renewed
his
attempts
to
seize
the
young
monkey
thus
he
went
back
and
forth
from
one
place
of
interest
to
the
other
several
times
but
being
unable
to
achieve
anything
at
either
point
he
finally
gave
up
and
returned
to
his
breakfast
on
the
floor
of
the
cage
i
report
this
incident
fully
because
the
behavior
of
jimmie
was
in
marked
contrast
with
the
usual
behavior
of
the
monkeys
selfishness
seemed
everywhere
dominant
while
clear
indications
of
sympathetic
emotions
were
rare
indeed
the
above
is
undoubtedly
the
best
evidence
of
anything
altruistic
that
i
obtained
it
is
possible
that
tiny
action
was
retaliatory
but
although
it
is
practically
certain
that
either
gertie
or
jimmie
inflicted
the
wound
on
her
finger
i
of
course
can
not
be
sure
that
the
spirit
of
revenge
stirred
her
to
punish
gertie
so
severely
jimmie
part
in
the
whole
affair
is
however
perfectly
intelligible
from
our
human
point
of
view
and
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
that
he
did
experience
something
like
a
feeling
of
sympathy
with
his
mate
coupled
with
a
feeling
of
resentment
or
anger
against
tiny
vi
historical
and
critical
discussion
of
ideational
behavior
in
monkeys
and
apes
it
is
my
purpose
in
this
section
to
indicate
the
relations
of
my
work
on
monkeys
and
apes
to
that
of
other
investigators
although
throughout
the
report
i
have
used
freely
the
psychological
terms
idea
and
ideation
it
has
been
my
aim
to
describe
the
behavior
of
my
animals
rather
than
to
interpret
it
or
speculate
concerning
its
accompaniments
certain
acts
i
have
designated
as
ideational
simply
because
they
seemed
to
exhibit
the
essential
features
of
what
we
call
ideational
behavior
in
man
further
study
may
and
probably
will
modify
my
opinion
concerning
this
matter
it
is
of
prime
importance
to
analyze
ideational
behavior
so
that
it
may
be
accurately
described
and
satisfactorily
defined
in
terms
of
its
distinguishing
characteristics
i
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
present
a
tentative
analysis
in
this
report
but
the
results
of
my
efforts
are
so
unsatisfactory
that
i
do
not
feel
justified
in
publishing
them
the
terms
idea
and
ideation
have
been
used
to
designate
contents
of
consciousness
which
are
primarily
representative
nowhere
have
i
attempted
to
indicate
different
types
or
grades
of
ideational
behavior
and
nowhere
have
i
found
it
necessary
to
emphasize
differences
between
image
and
idea
in
general
the
acts
which
i
have
called
ideational
have
been
highly
adaptive
and
the
learning
processes
in
connection
with
which
they
have
appeared
have
differed
strikingly
from
those
of
the
selective
sort
in
their
abruptness
of
appearance
extremely
interesting
and
valuable
definitions
of
ideation
and
discussions
of
the
characteristics
of
different
sorts
of
ideas
in
the
light
of
original
observations
on
monkeys
have
been
presented
by
thorndike
pp
kinnaman
and
hobhouse
as
these
authors
have
contributed
importantly
to
our
knowledge
of
the
behavior
of
monkeys
their
discussions
of
the
meaning
of
terms
are
especially
valuable
serviceable
definitions
are
to
be
found
also
in
romanes
morgan
washburn
and
holmes
of
ideation
in
aside
from
anecdotal
and
traveller
notes
on
the
behavior
of
monkeys
and
apes
we
have
only
a
scanty
literature
in
fact
the
really
excellent
articles
on
the
behavior
and
mental
life
of
these
animals
may
be
counted
on
one
fingers
and
not
more
than
half
of
these
are
experimental
studies
i
shall
in
this
brief
historical
sketch
neglect
entirely
the
anecdotal
literature
since
my
own
work
is
primarily
experimental
and
since
its
results
should
naturally
be
compared
with
those
of
other
experimenters
thorndike
the
american
pioneer
in
the
application
of
the
experimental
method
to
the
study
of
mind
in
animals
published
the
first
notable
paper
on
the
psychology
of
monkeys
his
results
force
the
conclusion
that
free
ideas
seldom
appear
in
the
monkey
mind
and
have
a
relatively
small
part
in
behavior
that
the
species
of
cebus
which
he
observed
exhibits
various
forms
of
ideation
he
is
willing
to
admit
but
he
insists
that
it
is
of
surprisingly
little
importance
in
comparison
with
what
the
general
behavior
of
monkeys
as
known
in
captivity
and
as
described
by
the
anecdotal
writers
have
led
us
to
expect
it
is
important
to
note
however
that
thorndike
observations
were
limited
to
cebus
monkeys
which
as
contrasted
with
various
old
world
types
are
now
considered
of
relatively
low
intelligence
in
many
respects
the
most
thoroughgoing
and
workmanlike
experimental
study
of
monkeys
is
that
of
kinnaman
who
has
reported
on
the
study
of
various
forms
of
response
in
he
presents
valuable
data
concerning
the
learning
processes
sensory
discrimination
reaction
to
number
and
to
tests
of
imitation
his
results
indicate
a
higher
level
of
intelligence
than
that
discovered
by
thorndike
but
this
is
almost
certainly
due
to
difference
in
the
species
observed
kinnaman
goes
so
far
as
to
say
we
have
found
evidence
also
of
general
notions
and
reasoning
both
of
low
order
the
contribution
of
hobhouse
to
our
knowledge
of
the
mental
life
of
monkeys
although
in
a
measure
experimental
is
based
upon
relatively
few
and
unsystematic
observations
as
contrasted
with
those
of
thorndike
and
kinnaman
it
appears
however
that
hobhouse
experiments
were
admirably
planned
to
test
the
ideational
capacity
of
his
subjects
and
one
can
not
find
a
more
stimulating
discussion
of
ideation
than
that
contained
in
his
mind
in
evolution
the
results
of
his
tests
made
with
a
monkey
are
similar
to
those
of
kinnaman
for
almost
all
of
them
indicate
the
presence
and
importance
of
ideas
watson
in
tests
of
the
imitative
ability
of
saw
relatively
little
evidence
of
other
than
extremely
simple
forms
of
ideation
but
in
contrast
with
his
results
those
obtained
by
haggerty
in
a
much
more
extended
investigation
in
which
several
species
of
monkey
were
used
obtained
more
numerous
and
convincing
evidences
of
ideation
in
imitative
behavior
although
this
author
wholly
avoids
the
use
of
psychological
terms
seeking
to
limit
himself
to
a
strictly
objective
presentation
of
results
it
is
clear
from
an
unpublished
manuscript
thesis
for
the
doctorate
of
philosophy
deposited
in
the
library
of
harvard
university
that
he
would
attribute
to
monkeys
simple
forms
of
ideational
experience
witmer
reports
in
confirmation
of
haggerty
results
intelligently
imitative
behavior
in
the
work
of
shepherd
agrees
closely
so
far
as
evidences
of
ideation
are
concerned
with
that
of
thorndike
he
obviously
strives
for
conservatism
in
his
statements
concerning
the
adaptive
intelligence
of
his
monkeys
all
of
which
belonged
to
the
species
at
one
point
he
definitely
states
that
they
exhibit
ideas
of
a
low
order
or
something
which
corresponds
to
them
satisfactory
evidences
of
reasoning
he
failed
to
obtain
franz
studies
of
monkeys
unlike
those
mentioned
above
have
for
their
chief
motive
not
the
accurate
description
of
various
features
of
behavior
but
instead
knowledge
of
the
functions
of
various
portions
of
the
brain
his
results
therefore
although
extremely
interesting
and
of
obvious
value
to
the
comparative
psychologist
throw
no
special
light
upon
the
problem
of
ideation
the
investigation
by
hamilton
of
reactive
tendencies
in
and
yielded
preeminently
important
data
concerning
complex
behavior
for
the
ingenious
method
devised
by
this
observer
showed
that
mature
monkeys
exhibit
fairly
adequate
types
of
response
as
hamilton
interest
centered
in
behavior
he
did
not
discuss
ideation
but
this
does
not
prevent
the
comparison
of
his
data
with
those
of
the
present
report
and
the
agreement
of
his
findings
with
my
own
is
obvious
my
work
contrasts
sharply
with
that
briefly
mentioned
above
in
that
i
applied
systematically
and
over
a
period
of
several
months
an
experimental
method
suited
to
reveal
problem
solving
ability
previously
the
problem
or
method
had
been
used
as
a
means
of
testing
for
the
presence
of
ideas
for
this
i
substituted
the
method
one
of
the
chief
advantages
of
this
new
method
is
the
possibility
of
obtaining
curves
of
learning
for
the
solution
or
attempted
solution
of
relational
problems
of
varying
difficultness
i
am
confident
that
these
curves
of
learning
will
prove
far
more
valuable
than
such
data
as
are
yielded
by
the
method
the
pithecus
monkeys
which
i
studied
intensively
yielded
relatively
abundant
evidences
of
ideation
but
with
thorndike
i
must
agree
that
of
free
ideas
there
is
scanty
evidence
or
rather
i
should
prefer
to
say
that
although
ideas
seem
to
be
in
play
frequently
they
are
rather
concrete
and
definitely
attached
than
free
neither
in
my
sustained
experiments
nor
from
my
supplementary
tests
did
i
obtain
convincing
indications
of
reasoning
what
hobhouse
has
called
articulate
ideas
i
believe
to
appear
infrequently
in
these
animals
but
on
the
whole
i
believe
that
the
general
conclusions
of
previous
experimental
observers
have
done
no
injustice
to
the
ideational
ability
of
monkeys
it
is
clearly
important
however
that
we
always
should
take
into
account
the
species
of
animal
observed
for
unquestionably
there
are
extreme
differences
in
mental
development
among
the
monkeys
as
i
view
my
results
in
the
light
of
their
relations
to
earlier
work
i
am
strongly
impressed
with
the
importance
of
the
use
of
improved
methods
for
the
study
of
complex
behavior
the
delayed
reaction
method
of
hunter
the
method
of
hamilton
and
my
method
offer
new
and
promising
approaches
to
forms
of
activity
which
thus
far
have
been
only
superficially
observed
the
ability
exhibited
by
skirrl
to
try
a
method
out
and
then
to
abandon
it
suddenly
is
characteristic
of
animals
high
in
intelligence
most
of
the
problems
which
i
presented
to
my
animals
would
be
rated
as
difficult
by
psychologists
for
as
a
rule
they
involved
definite
relations
and
demanded
on
the
part
of
the
subject
both
perception
of
a
particular
relation
and
the
ability
to
remember
or
it
on
occasion
i
was
greatly
surprised
by
the
slow
progress
of
the
monkeys
toward
the
solution
of
these
problems
it
had
been
my
supposition
that
they
would
solve
them
more
quickly
than
any
lower
type
of
mammal
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
succeeded
less
well
than
did
pigs
their
behavior
throughout
the
work
proved
that
of
far
greater
significance
for
the
experimenter
than
the
solution
of
a
problem
is
definite
knowledge
of
the
modes
of
behavior
exhibited
from
moment
to
moment
or
day
to
day
this
is
true
especially
of
those
incidental
or
accidental
modes
of
response
which
so
frequently
appeared
in
connection
with
my
work
that
i
came
to
look
upon
them
the
surprises
of
each
day
as
my
chief
means
of
insight
of
ideation
in
reliable
literature
of
any
sort
concerning
the
behavior
and
mental
life
of
the
anthropoid
apes
is
difficult
to
find
and
still
more
rare
are
reports
concerning
experimental
studies
of
these
animals
there
are
it
is
true
a
few
articles
descriptive
of
tests
of
mental
ability
but
even
these
are
scarcely
deserving
of
being
classed
as
satisfactory
experimental
studies
of
the
psychology
of
the
ape
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
present
in
the
present
report
the
first
systematic
experimental
study
of
any
feature
of
the
behavior
of
an
anthropoid
ape
among
the
most
interesting
and
valuable
of
the
descriptions
which
may
be
classed
among
accounts
of
tests
of
mental
ability
is
hobhouse
study
of
the
chimpanzee
the
subject
was
an
untrained
animal
so
far
as
stated
of
somewhat
unsatisfactory
condition
because
of
timidity
nevertheless
hobhouse
was
able
to
obtain
from
him
numerous
and
interesting
responses
to
novel
situations
some
of
which
may
be
safely
accepted
as
evidences
of
ideation
of
a
fairly
high
order
similar
in
method
and
result
to
the
work
of
hobhouse
is
that
of
haggerty
unpublished
thesis

of

to
solve
simple

results
which
contrast
most
strikingly
with
those
obtained
in
his
experimental
study
of
the
imitative
tendency
in
monkeys
his
observations
had
he
committed
himself
to
anything
approaching
interpretation
doubtless
would
have
led
him
to
conclusions
concerning
the
ideational
life
of
these

very
similar
to
those
of
hobhouse

according
to

certain
experiments
with
orang

similar
to
those
of
hobhouse
and
haggerty
his
results
i
am
unable
to
report
as
i
have
scanty
information
concerning
them
they
are
presumably
as
yet
unpublished

montecito
california
hamilton
has
from
time
to
time
kept
anthropoid
apes
but
without
special
effort
to
investigate
their
ideational
behavior
he
has
most
interesting
and
valuable
data
concerning
certain
habits
and
instincts
all
as
yet
unpublished
to
a
congress
of

pfungst
briefly
reported
on

with

in

of
the

his
preliminary

does
not
enable
one
to
make
definite
statements
concerning
either
his
methods
or
such
results
as
he
may
have
obtained
concerning
ideational
behavior
so
far
as
i
know
he
has
not
as
yet
published
further
concerning
his
investigation
möbius
has
described
interesting
observations
concerning
the
mental
life
of
the
chimpanzee
but
this
like
all
of
the
work
previously
mentioned
is
rather
in
the
nature
of
casual
testing
than
thoroughgoing
systematic
and
analytic
study
in
addition
to
the
above
reports
there
are
a
few
concerning
the
behavior
of
apes
which
have
been
especially
trained
for
purposes
of
exhibition
most
interesting
of
these
is
that
of
witmer
who
studied
in
exhibitions
and
in
his
own
laboratory
the
behavior
of
the
chimpanzee
peter
the
varied
forms
of
intelligently
adaptive
behavior
exhibited
by
this
ape
convinced
witmer
of
ideational
experience
and
even
of
an
approach
to
reasoning
in
his
brief
report
he
expresses
especial
interest
in
the
possibility
of
educating
this
genius
among
apes
to
the
use
of
language
a
chimpanzee
named
consul
was
observed
several
years
ago
by
hirschlaff
and
his
tricks
were
interestingly
described
from
the
pedagogical
standpoint
similar
in
character
is
shepherd
brief
description
of
the
stage
behavior
of
peter
and
consul
both
chimpanzees
it
is
impossible
to
determine
from
the
account
whether
these
animals
are
the
same
as
were
observed
by
both
witmer
and
hirschlaff
as
no
reference
is
made
in
shepherd
paper
to
other
descriptions
of
the
behavior
of
these
animals
and
as
he
adds
nothing
to
what
had
already
been
presented
the
reader
obtains
no
additional
light
on
ideation
i
have
mentioned
only
samples
of
the
articles
on
trained
anthropoids
all
are
necessarily
descriptions
of
the
behavior
of
individuals
who
had
been
trained
not
for
psychological
purposes
but
for
the
vaudeville
stage
and
although
such
observations
unquestionably
have
certain
value
for
comparative
psychology
it
is
well
known
that
unless
an
observer
knows
the
history
of
an
act
he
is
not
able
to
evaluate
it
in
terms
of
intelligence
and
is
especially
prone
to
overestimate
its
value
as
evidence
of
ideation
there
remain
studies
of
the
apes
dealing
primarily
with
behavior
and
mental
characteristics
which
are
slightly
if
at
all
experimental
and
deserve
to
be
ranked
as
naturalistic
accounts
such
is
for
example
the
book
of
sokolowski
in
which
attention
is
given
to
the
characteristics
of
young
as
well
as
fairly
mature
specimens
of
the
gorilla
chimpanzee
and
orang
utan
the
various
publications
of
garner
deal
especially
with
the
language
habits
of
monkeys
and
apes
but
observations
bearing
on
ideation
are
reported
wallace
describes
certain
features
of
the
behavior
of
an
infant
orang
utan
whose
mother
he
shot
in
borneo
he
also
reports
observations
concerning
the
behavior
of
adult
orang
utans
many
specimens
of
which
were
shot
by
him
during
his
travels
early
in
the
last
century
cuvier
interested
himself
in
studies
of
the
intellectual
characteristics
of
the
orang
utan
and
his
data
taken
with
those
of
wallace
sokolowski
and
others
similarly
interested
in
the
natural
history
of
mind
give
one
a
valuable
glimpse
of
the
life
of
the
anthropoid
ape
finally
the
data
brought
together
by
brehm
in
his
famous
tierleben
by
darwin
in
the
origin
of
species
and
other
works
by
romanes
especially
in
his
books
on
mental
evolution
by
lloyd
morgan
in
his
several
works
on
comparative
psychology
and
by
holmes
in
his
discussion
of
the
evolution
of
intelligence
contribute
not
unimportantly
to
our
all
too
meagre
knowledge
of
the
mental
life
of
the
anthropoid
apes
my
own
results
viewed
in
the
light
of
what
one
may
learn
from
the
literature
stand
out
as
unique
because
of
the
method
of
research
never
before
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
learn
has
any
ape
been
subjected
to
observation
under
systematically
controlled
conditions
for
so
long
a
period
as
six
months
moreover
my
method
has
the
merit
of
having
yielded
the
first
curve
of
learning
for
an
anthropoid
ape
this
fact
is
especially
interesting
when
one
considers
the
nature
of
the
particular
curve
for
so
far
as
one
may
say
by
comparing
it
with
the
curves
for
various
learning
processes
exhibited
by
other
mammals
it
is
indicative
of
ideation
of
a
high
order
and
possibly
of
reasoning
i
do
not
wish
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
my
results
for
as
contrasted
with
what
might
be
obtained
by
further
study
and
with
what
must
be
obtained
if
we
are
adequately
to
describe
the
mind
of
the
orang
utan
they
are
meager
indeed
especially
noteworthy
as
evidences
of
ideation
in
the
results
yielded
by
the
method
are
the
use
by
the
orang
utan
of
several
different
methods
in
connection
with
each
problem
the
suddenness
of
transition
from
method
to
method
the
final
and
perfect
solution
of
problem
i
without
diminution
of
the
initial
errors
the
dissociation
of
the
act
of
turning
in
a
circle
from
that
of
standing
in
front
of
a
particular
box
to
these
features
of
behavior
others
of
minor
importance
might
be
added
but
as
they
have
been
sufficiently
emphasized
in
the
foregoing
detailed
descriptions
i
need
only
repeat
my
conclusion
from
the
summation
of
evidence
that
this
young
orang
utan
exhibited
numerous
free
ideas
and
simple
thought
processes
in
connection
with
the
experiment
his
ultimate
failure
to
solve
the
second
problem
is
peculiarly
interesting
although
in
the
light
of
other
features
of
his
behavior
by
no
means
indicative
of
inferior
intelligence
the
various
supplementary
experimental
tests
which
i
employed
are
in
no
wise
importantly
distinguished
from
those
used
by
other
observers
the
box
stacking
experiment
has
according
to
my
private
information
been
used
by
koehler
it
is
obviously
important
that
such
tests
be
applied
in
the
same
manner
to
individuals
not
only
of
the
different
genera
of
anthropoid
apes
but
of
different
ages
sex
and
condition
of
training
the
box
stacking
experiment
although
it
yielded
complete
success
only
as
a
result
of
suggestion
on
my
part
proved
far
more
interesting
during
its
progress
than
any
other
portion
of
my
work
in
connection
with
it
the
orang
utan
exhibited
surprisingly
diverse
and
numerous
efforts
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
situation
it
is
fair
to
characterize
him
as
inventive
for
of
the
several
possible
ways
of
obtaining
the
banana
which
were
evident
to
the
experimenter
the
ape
voluntarily
used
all
but
two
or
three
and
one
of
these
he
subsequently
used
on
the
basis
of
imitation
had
julius
been
physically
and
mentally
mature
my
results
would
undoubtedly
have
been
much
more
impressively
indicative
of
ideas
but
even
as
matters
stand
the
survey
of
my
experimental
records
and
supplementary
notes
force
me
to
conclude
that
as
contrasted
with
the
monkeys
and
other
mammals
the
orang
utan
is
capable
of
expressing
free
ideas
in
considerable
number
and
of
using
them
in
ways
highly
indicative
of
thought
processes
possibly
even
of
the
rational
order
but
contrasted
with
that
of
man
the
ideational
life
of
the
orang
utan
seems
poverty
stricken
certainly
in
this
respect
julius
was
not
above
the
level
of
the
normal
child
in
common
with
other
observers
i
have
had
the
experience
of
being
profoundly
impressed
by
the
versatility
of
the
ape
and
however
much
i
might
desire
to
disprove
the
presence
of
free
ideas
and
simple
reasoning
processes
in
the
orang
utan
i
should
feel
bound
to
accept
many
of
the
results
of
my
tests
as
evidences
of
such
experience
i
have
attempted
to
indicate
briefly
the
historical
setting
of
my
investigation
i
propose
now
in
the
concluding
section
to
look
forward
from
this
initial
research
and
to
indicate
as
well
as
i
may
in
a
few
words
the
possibilities
of
results
important
for
mankind
from
the
thorough
study
of
the
monkeys
and
anthropoid
apes
vii
provision
for
the
study
of
the
primates
and
especially
the
monkeys
and
anthropoid
apes
footnote
much
of
the
material
of
this
section
was
published
originally
in
yerkes
i
should
neglect
an
important
duty
as
well
as
waste
an
opportunity
if
in
this
report
i
did
not
call
attention
to
the
status
of
our
knowledge
concerning
the
monkeys
and
apes
and
present
the
urgent
need
of
adequate
provision
for
the
comparative
study
of
all
of
the
primates
although
for
centuries
students
of
nature
have
been
keenly
interested
in
the
various
primates
the
information
which
has
been
accumulated
is
fragmentary
and
wholly
inadequate
for
generally
recognized
scientific
and
practical
needs
there
is
a
voluminous
literature
on
many
aspects
of
the
organization
and
lives
of
the
monkeys
and
apes
but
when
one
searches
in
it
for
reasonably
connected
and
complete
descriptions
of
the
organisms
from
any
biological
angle
one
is
certain
to
meet
disappointment
concerning
their
external
characteristics
we
know
much
and
our
classifications
if
not
satisfactory
to
all
are
at
least
eminently
useful
but
when
one
turns
to
the
morphological
sciences
of
anatomy
histology
embryology
and
pathology
one
discovers
great
gaps
where
knowledge
might
reasonably
be
expected
even
gross
anatomy
has
much
to
gain
from
the
careful
systematic
examination
of
these
organisms
with
still
greater
force
this
statement
applies
to
the
studies
of
finer
structural
relations
little
is
known
concerning
the
embryological
development
and
life
history
of
certain
of
the
primates
and
almost
nothing
concerning
their
pathological
anatomy
clearly
less
satisfactory
than
our
knowledge
of
structure
is
the
status
of
information
concerning
those
functional
processes
which
are
the
special
concern
of
physiology
and
pathology
certain
important
experimental
studies
have
been
made
on
the
nervous
system
but
rarely
indeed
have
physiologists
dealt
systematically
with
the
functions
of
other
systems
of
organs
there
are
almost
no
satisfactory
physiological
descriptions
of
the
monkeys

man
when
we
turn
to
the
science
of
genetics
we
meet
a
similar
condition
for
the
literature
reveals
only
scattered
bits
of
information
concerning
heredity
in
the
primates
no
important
experimental
studies
along
genetic
lines
have
been
made
with
them
and
such
general
observations
from
nature
as
are
on
record
are
of
extremely
uncertain
value
were
one
to
insist
that
we
know
nothing
certainly
concerning
the
relation
of
heredity
in
other
primates
than
man
the
statement
could
not
well
be
disputed
occasionally
in
recent
years
students
of
human
diseases
have
employed
monkeys
or
apes
for
experimental
tests
but
aside
from
the
isolated
results
thus
obtained
extremely
little
is
known
concerning
the
diseases
peculiar
to
the
various
types
of
primates
or
the
significant
relations
of
their
diseases
to
those
of
man
next
in
order
of
extent
to
our
morphological
knowledge
of
these
organisms
is
that
of
their
behavior
mental
life
and
social
relations
but
certainly
no
one
who
is
conversant
with
the
behavioristic
psychological
and
sociological
literature
could
do
otherwise
than
emphasize
its
incompleteness
and
inadequacy
for
our
knowledge
of
behavior
has
come
mostly
from
naturalistic
observation
scarcely
at
all
from
experimentation
our
knowledge
of
social
relations
is
obviously
meager
and
of
uncertain
value
and
finally
our
knowledge
of
mind
is
barely
more
than
a
collection
of
carelessly
drawn
inferences
this
picture
of
the
status
of
scientific
work
on
the
primates
although
not
overdrawn
will
doubtless
surprise
many
readers
and
even
the
biologist
may
find
himself
wondering
why
we
are
so
ignorant
concerning
the
lives
of
the
organisms
most
nearly
akin
to
us
and
naturally
of
deepest
interest
to
us
the
reasons
are
not
far
to
seek
most
scientific
investigators
are
forced
by
circumstances
to
work
with
organisms
which
are
readily
obtained
and
easily
kept
the
primates
have
neither
of
these
advantages
for
many
if
not
most
of
them
are
expensive
to
get
and
either
difficult
or
expensive
to
keep
in
good
condition
clearly
then
our
ignorance
is
due
not
to
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
scientific
value
of
primate
research
but
instead
to
its
difficultness
and
costliness
strangely
enough
the
practical
importance
of
knowledge
of
the
primates
has
seldom
been
dwelt
upon
even
by
those
biologists
who
are
especially
interested
in
it
it
is
therefore
appropriate
to
emphasize
the
strictly
human
value
of
the
work
for
which
i
am
seeking
provision
during
the
past
few
years
it
has
been
abundantly
and
convincingly
demonstrated
that
knowledge
of
other
organisms
may
aid
directly
in
the
solution
of
many
of
the
problems
of
experimental
medicine
of
physiology
genetics
psychology
sociology
and
economics
in
the
light
of
these
results
it
is
obviously
desirable
that
all
studies
of
infrahuman
organisms
but
especially
those
of
the
various
primates
should
be
made
to
contribute
to
the
solution
of
our
human
problems
to
me
it
seems
that
thoroughgoing
knowledge
of
the
lives
of
the
infrahuman
primates
would
inevitably
make
for
human
betterment
through
the
science
of
genetics
as
advanced
by
experimental
studies
of
the
monkeys
and
anthropoid
apes
practical
eugenic
procedures
should
be
more
safely
based
and
our
ability
to
predict
organic
phenomena
greatly
increased
similarly
intensive
knowledge
of
the
diseases
of
the
other
primates
in
their
relations
to
human
diseases
should
contribute
importantly
to
human
welfare
and
finally
our
careful
studies
of
the
fundamental
instincts
forms
of
habit
formation
and
social
relations
in
the
monkeys
and
apes
should
lead
to
radical
improvements
in
our
educational
methods
as
well
as
in
other
forms
of
social
service
along
theoretical
lines
no
less
than
practical
systematic
research
with
the
primates
should
rapidly
justify
itself
for
upon
its
results
must
rest
the
most
significant
historical
or
genetic
biological
descriptions
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
genetic
psychology
can
best
be
advanced
by
such
work
and
what
is
obviously
true
of
this
science
is
not
less
true
of
all
the
biological
sciences
which
take
account
of
the
developmental
or
genetic
relations
of
their
events
in
view
of
the
probable
values
of
increasingly
complete
accounts
of
primate
life
it
seems
far
from
extravagant
to
insist
that
the
securing
of
adequate
provision
for
systematic
and
long
continued
research
is
the
most
important
task
for
our
generation
of
biologists
and
the
one
which
we
shall
be
least
excusable
for
neglecting
indeed
when
one
stops
to
reflect
concerning
the
situation
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
the
task
has
not
been
accomplished
some
ten
years
ago
professor
john
watson
entered
a
plea
for
the
founding
of
a
station
for
the
experimental
study
of
behavior
he
made
no
special
mention
of
work
with
the
monkeys
and
apes
but
it
is
clear
from
the
problems
which
he
enumerates
that
he
would
consider
them
most
important
subjects
for
observation
professor
watson
plea
has
apparently
been
forgotten
by
american
biologists
and
it
seems
not
inappropriate
to
revive
it
at
this
time
for
surely
we
have
advanced
sufficiently
along
material
and
scientific
lines
during
the
last
ten
years
to
render
possible
the
realization
of
his
hope
to
my
knowledge
only
one
definite
attempt
has
thus
far
been
made
to
gain
special
provision
for
the
study
of
the
primates
somewhere
about
the
year
there
was
established
on
tenerife
one
of
the
canary
islands
a
modest
station
for
the
study
of
the
anthropoid
apes
i
have
already
referred
to
it
briefly
on
page
the
plan
and
purpose
of
this
station
which
is
of
german
origin
have
been
presented
briefly
by
rothmann
from
personal
communications
i
know
that
a
single
investigator
has
been
in
residence
at
the
station
since
its
founding
and
that
psychological
and
physiological
results
of
value
have
been
obtained
but
no
published
reports
have
come
to
my
attention
when
i
first
heard
of
the
existence
of
the
german
anthropoid
station
i
naturally
thought
of
the
possibility
of
coöperative
work
but
the
events
of
the
past
two
years
have
rendered
the
chances
of
cooperation
so
remote
that
it
now
seems
wholly
desirable
and
indeed
imperative
to
seek
the
establishment
of
an
american
station
which
unlike
the
german
station
shall
provide
adequately
not
only
for
the
study
of
the
anthropoid
apes
but
for
that
of
all
of
the
lower
primates
it
should
be
the
function
of
such
a
station
or
research
institute
to
bring
together
and
correlate
all
the
information
at
present
available
to
fill
in
existing
gaps
observationally
and
thus
complete
and
perfect
our
knowledge
of
these
organisms
to
seek
to
bring
all
available
information
to
bear
upon
the
problems
of
human
life
hitherto
the
unsatisfactoriness
of
progress
has
been
due
to
the
lack
of
a
definite
plan
and
program
every
investigator
has
gone
his
own
way
doing
what
little
his
personal
means
and
opportunity
rendered
possible
the
time
has
at
last
come
when
concerted
action
seems
feasible
as
well
as
eminently
desirable
i
am
therefore
offering
a
plan
and
program
which
if
wisely
developed
should
lead
ultimately
to
fairly
complete
and
practically
invaluable
knowledge
of
the
lives
of
all
of
the
primates
there
should
be
provided
in
a
suitable
locality
a
station
or
research
institute
which
should
offer
adequate
facilities
for
the
maintenance
of
various
types
of
primate
in
normal
healthy
condition
for
the
successful
breeding
and
rearing
of
the
animals
generation
after
generation
for
systematic
and
continuous
observation
under
reasonably
natural
conditions
for
experimental
investigations
from
every
significant
biological
point
of
view
for
profitable
cooperation
with
existing
biological
institutes
or
departments
of
research
throughout
the
world
the
station
should
be
located
in
a
region
whose
climate
is
highly
favorable
to
the
life
of
many
of
the
lower
primates
as
well
as
to
that
of
man
such
a
location
is
by
no
means
easy
to
find
because
of
my
intense
interest
in
the
subject
i
have
during
the
past
five
years
prospected
in
various
parts
of
the
world
for
a
satisfactory
site
i
shall
now
attempt
to
indicate
the
chief
requirements
and
also
the
foremost
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
several
regions
which
have
been
considered
it
is
first
of
all
requisite
that
the
climate
be
such
as
to
agree
with
the
organisms
to
be
studied
and
such
also
as
to
render
their
breeding
normal
and
dependable
second
in
importance
is
its
satisfactoriness
for
the
life
and
scientific
productiveness
of
the
observer
while
certain
tropical
localities
would
meet
the
first
requirement
perfectly
they
would
prove
extremely
unsatisfactory
for
research
activity
it
therefore
seems
essential
to
find
a
region
whose
climate
shall
reasonably
meet
the
needs
of
the
experimenter
while
adequately
meeting
those
of
the
animals
to
be
studied
a
further
factor
which
has
important
bearing
upon
the
productiveness
of
the
observer
is
the
degree
of
isolation
from
civilization
and
from
other
scientific
work
no
scientist
can
long
work
effectively
even
in
a
reasonably
healthy
and
stimulating
climate
if
entirely
cut
off
from
similar
interests
and
activities
it
is
therefore
desirable
if
at
all
possible
to
discover
a
location
in
the
midst
of
civilization
and
with
reasonably
good
opportunities
for
scientific
associations
with
these
several
desiderata
before
us
i
shall
call
attention
to
a
number
of
possible
sites
for
a
station
several
of
which
i
have
visited
southern
california
and
especially
the
portion
of
the
state
between
santa
barbara
and
san
diego
promises
fairly
well
it
is
definitely
known
that
certain
if
not
all
species
of
monkey
will
breed
there
fairly
satisfactorily
and
although
it
has
not
yet
been
demonstrated
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
in
certain
regions
the
anthropoid
apes
might
not
also
be
kept
in
perfect
health
and
successfully
bred
the
main
advantages
of
this
general
region
are
a
a
climate
which
promises
to
be
reasonably
satisfactory
for
many
if
not
all
of
the
primates
b
admirable
climatic
conditions
for
investigators
c
wholly
satisfactory
scientific
and
cultural
environment
for
the
staff
of
a
station
the
most
significant
disadvantages
are
a
a
temperature
which
is
at
times
a
trifle
too
low
for
the
comfort
of
certain
of
the
monkeys
and
apes
it
is
by
no
means
certain
however
that
they
would
not
usually
adapt
themselves
to
it
b
the
necessity
of
importing
all
of
the
animals
and
of
having
to
rely
upon
successful
acclimatization
of
course
it
is
to
be
assumed
that
importation
would
be
necessary
only
at
the
outset
of
such
work
since
the
animals
later
should
replenish
themselves
within
the
confines
of
the
station
florida
offers
possibilities
somewhat
similar
to
those
of
southern
california
but
as
i
have
not
had
opportunity
to
examine
the
conditions
myself
i
can
say
only
that
in
view
of
such
information
as
is
available
the
advantage
seems
to
be
greatly
in
favor
of
the
latter
cuba
jamaica
porto
rico
and
for
that
matter
several
of
the
west
indies
offer
possible
sites
for
a
successful
station
i
have
reasonably
intimate
personal
knowledge
only
of
the
conditions
in
jamaica
the
major
advantages
in
the
west
indies
are
a
suitable
climatic
conditions
and
food
supply
for
the
animals
and
b
reasonably
satisfactory
climatic
conditions
for
the
staff
these
are
however
more
than
counterbalanced
in
my
opinion
by
the
following
serious
disadvantages
a
the
relative
isolation
of
the
investigators
from
their
fellow
scientists
b
the
necessity
of
importing
all
of
the
animals
originally
used
c
the
risk
of
destruction
of
the
station
by
storms
it
is
definitely
known
that
anthropoid
apes
as
well
as
monkeys
can
be
successfully
kept
bred
and
reared
in
the
west
indies
during
the
past
year
on
the
estate
of
doha
rosalia
abreu
near
havana
cuba
a
chimpanzee
was
born
in
captivity
a
valuable
account
of
this
important
event
and
of
the
young
ape
has
been
published
by
doctor
louis
montané
it
therefore
seems
practically
certain
that
regions
could
be
found
readily
on
jamaica
porto
rico
or
smaller
islands
which
would
be
eminently
satisfactory
for
the
breeding
of
apes
there
are
obvious
reasons
why
an
american
station
for
the
study
of
the
primates
should
be
located
on
territory
controlled
by
the
united
states
government
and
if
a
tropical
location
proves
necessary
it
would
probably
be
difficult
to
find
more
satisfactory
regions
aside
from
the
inconveniences
and
risk
of
importation
and
the
relative
isolation
of
the
investigators
than
are
available
on
porto
rico
i
have
not
seriously
considered
the
possibility
of
locating
an
american
station
on
the
continent
of
africa
for
although
two
of
the
most
interesting
and
important
of
the
anthropoid
apes
the
gorilla
and
the
chimpanzee
are
african
forms
while
many
species
of
monkey
are
either
found
there
or
could
readily
be
imported
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
the
islands
of
the
west
and
east
indies
and
the
portions
of
the
united
states
referred
to
above
are
much
to
be
preferred
over
anything
available
in
africa
in
the
east
borneo
the
philippine
islands
and
hawaii
are
well
worth
considering
borneo
is
the
home
of
the
gibbon
and
of
at
least
one
species
of
orang
utan
and
in
addition
to
these
important
assets
it
presents
the
advantages
of
a
a
wholly
suitable
climate
and
food
supply
for
monkeys
and
apes
and
b
climatic
conditions
for
investigators
which
i
am
informed
by
scientific
friends
are
nearly
ideal
for
investigators
the
most
serious
disadvantage
here
as
in
all
other
parts
of
the
east
would
be
the
isolation
from
other
scientific
work
and
workers
the
possibilities
of
central
america
i
considered
several
years
ago
when
it
seemed
to
me
possible
that
work
might
profitably
be
done
with
monkeys
and
apes
on
the
canal
zone
the
advantages
are
a
a
climate
which
promises
fairly
well
for
the
animals
and
b
reasonable
accessibility
from
the
united
states
the
disadvantages
are
a
a
far
from
ideal
climate
for
long
continued
scientific
work
and
b
an
environment
which
from
the
cultural
and
scientific
point
of
view
leaves
much
to
be
desired
were
a
permanent
station
for
the
study
of
the
primates
to
be
established
in
southern
california
it
would
even
though
wholly
satisfactory
conditions
for
the
breeding
rearing
and
studying
of
the
animals
were
maintained
furnish
more
or
less
inadequate
opportunity
for
the
observation
of
the
animals
under
free
natural
conditions
it
would
therefore
be
necessary
to
supplement
the
work
of
such
a
station
by
field
work
in
borneo
sumatra
africa
india
south
america
and
such
other
regions
as
the
species
of
organism
under
consideration
happen
to
inhabit
considering
equally
the
needs
of
the
experimenter
and
the
demands
of
the
animals
it
seems
to
me
reasonable
to
conclude
that
southern
california
should
be
definitely
proved
unsuitable
before
a
more
distant
site
were
selected
for
the
information
which
i
have
been
able
to
accumulate
convinces
me
that
it
would
in
all
probability
be
possible
successfully
to
breed
and
keep
the
primates
there
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
in
such
event
the
output
of
a
station
would
be
enormously
greater
because
of
the
more
favorable
conditions
for
research
than
in
any
tropical
region
or
in
a
more
isolated
location
assuming
that
satisfactory
provision
in
the
shape
of
a
scientific
establishment
for
the
study
of
the
primates
in
their
relations
to
man
were
available
the
following
program
might
be
followed
systematic
and
continuous
studies
of
important
forms
of
individual
behavior
of
social
relations
and
of
mind
experimental
studies
of
physiological
processes
normal
and
pathological
and
especially
of
the
diseases
of
the
lower
primates
in
their
relations
to
those
of
man
studies
of
heredity
embryology
and
life
history
research
in
comparative
anatomy
including
gross
anatomy
histology
neurology
and
pathological
anatomy
each
of
these
several
kinds
of
research
should
be
in
progress
almost
continuously
in
order
that
no
materials
or
opportunities
for
observation
be
needlessly
wasted
because
of
the
nature
of
the
work
it
would
be
necessary
to
provide
first
of
all
for
those
functional
studies
which
demand
healthy
and
normally
active
organisms
whose
life
history
is
intimately
and
completely
known
this
is
true
of
all
studies
in
behavior
whether
physiological
psychological
or
sociological
simultaneously
with
behavioristic
observations
and
often
upon
the
same
individuals
genetic
experiments
might
be
conducted
this
would
be
extremely
desirable
because
of
the
relatively
long
periods
between
generations
after
the
usefulness
of
an
animal
in
behavioristic
or
genetic
inquiries
had
been
exhausted
it
might
be
made
to
render
still
further
service
to
science
in
various
experimental
physiological
or
medical
inquiries
and
finally
the
same
individual
might
ultimately
be
used
for
various
forms
of
anatomical
research
thus
it
is
clear
that
the
scientific
usefulness
of
a
lemur
a
monkey
or
an
ape
might
be
maintained
at
a
high
level
throughout
and
even
beyond
the
period
of
its
life
history
the
program
thus
briefly
sketched
would
provide
either
directly
or
indirectly
for
work
on
every
aspect
of
primate
life
especially
important
would
be
the
intimacy
of
interest
and
cooperation
among
investigators
for
the
comparative
method
should
be
applied
consistently
and
to
the
limit
of
its
value
the
results
of
various
kinds
of
observation
should
be
correlated
so
that
there
should
ultimately
emerge
a
unitary
and
practically
valuable
account
of
primate
life
to
replace
the
patchwork
of
information
which
we
now
possess
because
of
the
costliness
of
maintaining
and
breeding
the
monkeys
and
apes
it
is
especially
desirable
that
the
several
kinds
of
research
mentioned
above
should
be
conducted
indeed
it
would
seem
inexcusably
wasteful
to
attempt
to
maintain
a
primate
or
anthropoid
station
for
psychological
observations
alone
or
for
any
other
narrowly
limited
biological
inquiry
furthermore
the
station
should
be
permanent
since
for
many
kinds
of
work
it
would
be
essential
to
have
intimate
knowledge
of
the
life
history
and
descent
of
an
individual
with
the
lower
primates
a
generation
might
be
obtained
in
from
two
to
five
years
with
the
higher
not
more
frequently
probably
than
from
ten
to
fifteen
years
it
therefore
seems
not
improbable
that
the
value
of
the
work
done
in
such
a
station
would
continue
to
increase
for
many
years
and
would
not
reach
its
maximum
short
of
fifty
or
even
one
hundred
years
a
staff
of
several
highly
trained
and
experienced
biologists
would
be
needed
the
following
organization
is
suggested
as
desirable
although
as
indicated
below
not
necessarily
essential
in
the
beginning
an
expert
especially
interested
in
the
problems
of
behavior
psychology
and
sociology
with
keen
appreciation
of
practical
as
well
as
of
theoretical
problems
an
assistant
trained
especially
in
comparative
physiology
an
expert
in
genetics
and
experimental
zoology
an
assistant
with
training
and
interests
in
comparative
anatomy
histology
and
embryology
an
expert
in
experimental
medicine
who
could
conduct
and
direct
studies
of
the
diseases
of
man
as
well
as
of
the
lower
primates
and
of
measures
for
their
control
an
assistant
trained
especially
in
pathology
and
neurology
to
this
scientific
staff
of
six
highly
trained
individuals
there
should
be
added
a
business
manager
a
clerical
force
of
three
individuals
a
skilled
mechanician
a
carpenter
and
at
least
four
laborers
the
annual
expenditures
of
an
institute
with
such
a
working
staff
would
in
southern
california
approximate
fifty
thousand
dollars
it
would
therefore
be
necessary
that
it
have
an
endowment
of
approximately
one
million
dollars
in
the
absence
of
this
foundation
it
would
of
course
be
possible
to
make
a
reasonably
satisfactory
beginning
on
the
work
which
has
been
outlined
in
the
following
less
expensive
manner
a
working
plant
might
be
established
on
ground
rented
or
purchased
at
a
low
figure
for
about
ten
thousand
dollars
the
salary
of
a
director
assistants
a
clerical
helper
and
combined
mechanic
and
laborer
might
be
estimated
at
the
same
figure
the
cost
of
animals
and
of
maintenance
of
the
plant
would
approximate
five
thousand
dollars
thus
we
should
obtain
as
an
estimate
of
the
expenditures
for
the
first
year
thousand
dollars
without
expansion
the
work
might
be
conducted
during
the
second
year
for
fifteen
thousand
dollars
and
subsequently
it
might
be
curtailed
or
expanded
resources
permitting
according
as
results
achieved
and
in
prospect
justified
an
institute
established
on
such
a
modest
basis
as
this
still
might
render
largely
important
scientific
service
through
its
own
research
and
through
organized
cooperation
with
other
existing
research
establishments
thus
for
example
supposing
that
behavioristic
psychological
sociological
and
genetic
inquiries
were
conducted
in
the
institute
itself
animals
might
be
supplied
on
a
mutually
satisfactory
basis
to
institutes
for
experimental
medicine
for
physiological
research
and
for
anatomical
studies
under
such
conditions
it
is
conceivable
that
extremely
economical
and
good
use
might
be
made
of
all
the
available
primate
materials
but
it
is
not
improbable
that
even
coöperative
research
would
prove
on
the
whole
more
profitable
except
possibly
in
the
case
of
morphological
work
if
investigators
could
conduct
their
studies
in
the
institute
itself
rather
than
in
distant
laboratories
in
any
event
the
idea
of
coöperation
should
be
prominent
in
connection
with
the
organization
of
a
research
station
for
the
study
of
the
primates
for
thus
evidently
scientific
achievement
in
connection
with
these
important
types
of
animal
might
be
vastly
increased
over
what
would
be
possible
in
a
single
relatively
small
institution
with
a
limited
and
necessarily
specialized
staff
of
workers
despite
the
fact
that
biologists
generally
recognize
the
importance
of
the
work
under
consideration
and
are
eager
to
have
it
done
it
is
perfectly
certain
that
we
shall
accomplish
nothing
unless
we
devote
ourselves
confidently
determinedly
and
unitedly
with
faith
vision
and
enthusiasm
to
the
realization
of
a
definite
plan
our
vision
is
clear
if
we
are
to
gather
and
place
at
the
service
of
mankind
adequate
comparative
knowledge
of
the
life
of
the
primates
and
if
we
are
to
make
this
possible
harvest
of
scientific
results
count
for
human
betterment
we
must
bend
all
our
efforts
to
the
establishment
of
a
station
or
institute
for
research
