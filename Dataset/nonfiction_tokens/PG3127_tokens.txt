being
a
boy
by
charles
dudley

being
a
boy
i
being
a
boy
one
of
the
best
things
in
the
world
to
be
is
a
boy
it
requires
no
experience
though
it
needs
some
practice
to
be
a
good
one
the
disadvantage
of
the
position
is
that
it
does
not
last
long
enough
it
is
soon
over
just
as
you
get
used
to
being
a
boy
you
have
to
be
something
else
with
a
good
deal
more
work
to
do
and
not
half
so
much
fun
and
yet
every
boy
is
anxious
to
be
a
man
and
is
very
uneasy
with
the
restrictions
that
are
put
upon
him
as
a
boy
good
fun
as
it
is
to
yoke
up
the
calves
and
play
work
there
is
not
a
boy
on
a
farm
but
would
rather
drive
a
yoke
of
oxen
at
real
work
what
a
glorious
feeling
it
is
indeed
when
a
boy
is
for
the
first
time
given
the
long
whip
and
permitted
to
drive
the
oxen
walking
by
their
side
swinging
the
long
lash
and
shouting
buck
golden
bright
and
all
the
rest
of
that
remarkable
language
until
he
is
red
in
the
face
and
all
the
neighbors
for
half
a
mile
are
aware
that
something
unusual
is
going
on
if
i
were
a
boy
i
am
not
sure
but
i
would
rather
drive
the
oxen
than
have
a
birthday
the
proudest
day
of
my
life
was
one
day
when
i
rode
on
the
neap
of
the
cart
and
drove
the
oxen
all
alone
with
a
load
of
apples
to
the
i
was
so
little
that
it
was
a
wonder
that
i
did
fall
off
and
get
under
the
broad
wheels
nothing
could
make
a
boy
who
cared
anything
for
his
appearance
feel
flatter
than
to
be
run
over
by
the
broad
tire
of
a
but
i
never
heard
of
one
who
was
and
i
do
believe
one
ever
will
be
as
i
said
it
was
a
great
day
for
me
but
i
do
remember
that
the
oxen
cared
much
about
it
they
sagged
along
in
their
great
clumsy
way
switching
their
tails
in
my
face
occasionally
and
now
and
then
giving
a
lurch
to
this
or
that
side
of
the
road
attracted
by
a
choice
tuft
of
grass
and
then
i
the
julius
over
them
if
you
will
allow
me
to
use
such
a
slang
expression
a
liberty
i
never
should
permit
you
i
do
know
that
julius
caesar
ever
drove
cattle
though
he
must
often
have
seen
the
peasants
from
the
campagna
and
them
round
the
forum
of
course
in
latin
a
language
that
those
cattle
understood
as
well
as
ours
do
english
but
what
i
mean
is
that
i
stood
up
and
with
all
my
might
as
everybody
does
with
oxen
as
if
they
were
born
deaf
and
whacked
them
with
the
long
lash
over
the
head
just
as
the
big
folks
did
when
they
drove
i
think
now
that
it
was
a
cowardly
thing
to
crack
the
patient
old
fellows
over
the
face
and
eyes
and
make
them
wink
in
their
meek
manner
if
i
am
ever
a
boy
again
on
a
farm
i
shall
speak
gently
to
the
oxen
and
not
go
screaming
round
the
farm
like
a
crazy
man
and
i
shall
not
hit
them
a
cruel
cut
with
the
lash
every
few
minutes
because
it
looks
big
to
do
so
and
i
can
not
think
of
anything
else
to
do
i
never
liked
lickings
myself
and
i
do
know
why
an
ox
should
like
them
especially
as
he
can
not
reason
about
the
moral
improvement
he
is
to
get
out
of
them
speaking
of
latin
reminds
me
that
i
once
taught
my
cows
latin
i
mean
that
i
taught
them
to
read
it
for
it
is
very
difficult
to
teach
a
cow
to
read
latin
or
any
of
the
dead
languages
a
cow
cares
more
for
her
cud
than
she
does
for
all
the
classics
put
together
but
if
you
begin
early
you
can
teach
a
cow
or
a
calf
if
you
can
teach
a
calf
anything
which
i
doubt
latin
as
well
as
english
there
were
ten
cows
which
i
had
to
escort
to
and
from
pasture
night
and
morning
to
these
cows
i
gave
the
names
of
the
roman
numerals
beginning
with
unus
and
duo
and
going
up
to
decem
decem
was
of
course
the
biggest
cow
of
the
party
or
at
least
she
was
the
ruler
of
the
others
and
had
the
place
of
honor
in
the
stable
and
everywhere
else
i
admire
cows
and
especially
the
exactness
with
which
they
define
their
social
position
in
this
case
decem
could
novem
and
novem
could
octo
and
so
on
down
to
unus
who
could
lick
anybody
except
her
own
calf
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
called
the
weakest
cow
una
instead
of
unus
considering
her
sex
but
i
did
care
much
to
teach
the
cows
the
declensions
of
adjectives
in
which
i
was
not
very
well
up
myself
and
besides
it
would
be
of
little
use
to
a
cow
people
who
devote
themselves
too
severely
to
study
of
the
classics
are
apt
to
become
dried
up
and
you
should
never
do
anything
to
dry
up
a
cow
well
these
ten
cows
knew
their
names
after
a
while
at
least
they
appeared
to
and
would
take
their
places
as
i
called
them
at
least
if
octo
attempted
to
get
before
novem
in
going
through
the
bars
i
have
heard
people
speak
of
a
of
when
there
were
six
or
eight
of
them
or
into
the
stable
the
matter
of
precedence
was
settled
then
and
there
and
once
settled
there
was
no
dispute
about
it
afterwards
novem
either
put
her
horns
into
octo
ribs
and
octo
shambled
to
one
side
or
else
the
two
locked
horns
and
tried
the
game
of
push
and
gore
until
one
gave
up
nothing
is
stricter
than
the
etiquette
of
a
party
of
cows
there
is
nothing
in
royal
courts
equal
to
it
rank
is
exactly
settled
and
the
same
individuals
always
have
the
precedence
you
know
that
at
windsor
castle
if
the
royal
silver
stick
should
happen
to
get
in
front
of
the
most
royal
golden
rod
when
the
court
is
going
in
to
dinner
something
so
dreadful
would
happen
that
we
do
dare
to
think
of
it
it
is
certain
that
the
soup
would
get
cold
while
the
golden
rod
was
pitching
the
silver
stick
out
of
the
castle
window
into
the
moat
and
perhaps
the
island
of
great
britain
itself
would
split
in
two
but
the
people
are
very
careful
that
it
never
shall
happen
so
we
shall
probably
never
know
what
the
effect
would
be
among
cows
as
i
say
the
question
is
settled
in
short
order
and
in
a
different
manner
from
what
it
sometimes
is
in
other
society
it
is
said
that
in
other
society
there
is
sometimes
a
great
scramble
for
the
first
place
for
the
leadership
as
it
is
called
and
that
women
and
men
too
fight
for
what
is
called
position
and
in
order
to
be
first
they
will
injure
their
neighbors
by
telling
stories
about
them
and
by
backbiting
which
is
the
meanest
kind
of
biting
there
is
not
excepting
the
bite
of
fleas
but
in
cow
society
there
is
nothing
of
this
detraction
in
order
to
get
the
first
place
at
the
crib
or
the
farther
stall
in
the
stable
if
the
question
arises
the
cows
turn
in
horns
and
all
and
settle
it
with
one
square
fight
and
that
ends
it
i
have
often
admired
this
trait
in
cows
besides
latin
i
used
to
try
to
teach
the
cows
a
little
poetry
and
it
is
a
very
good
plan
it
does
not
do
the
cows
much
good
but
it
is
very
good
exercise
for
a
boy
farmer
i
used
to
commit
to
memory
as
good
short
poems
as
i
could
find
the
cows
liked
to
listen
to
about
as
well
as
anything
and
repeat
them
when
i
went
to
the
pasture
and
as
i
drove
the
cows
home
through
the
sweet
ferns
and
down
the
rocky
slopes
it
improves
a
boy
elocution
a
great
deal
more
than
driving
oxen
it
is
a
fact
also
that
if
a
boy
repeats
while
he
is
milking
that
operation
acquires
a
certain
dignity
ii
the
boy
as
a
farmer
boys
in
general
would
be
very
good
farmers
if
the
current
notions
about
farming
were
not
so
very
different
from
those
they
entertain
what
passes
for
laziness
is
very
often
an
unwillingness
to
farm
in
a
particular
way
for
instance
some
morning
in
early
summer
john
is
told
to
catch
the
sorrel
mare
harness
her
into
the
spring
wagon
and
put
in
the
buffalo
and
the
best
whip
for
father
is
obliged
to
drive
over
to
the
to
see
a
about
some
cattle
to
talk
with
the
road
commissioner
to
go
to
the
store
for
the
folks
and
to
attend
to
other
important
business
and
very
likely
he
will
not
be
back
till
sundown
it
must
be
very
pressing
business
for
the
old
gentleman
drives
off
in
this
way
somewhere
almost
every
pleasant
day
and
appears
to
have
a
great
deal
on
his
mind
meantime
he
tells
john
that
he
can
play
ball
after
he
has
done
up
the
chores
as
if
the
chores
could
ever
be
on
a
farm
he
is
first
to
clean
out
the
then
to
take
a
and
cut
down
the
thistles
and
weeds
from
the
fence
corners
in
the
home
and
along
the
road
towards
the
village
to
dig
up
the
docks
round
the
garden
patch
to
weed
out
the
to
hoe
the
early
potatoes
to
rake
the
sticks
and
leaves
out
of
the
front
yard
in
short
there
is
work
enough
laid
out
for
john
to
keep
him
busy
it
seems
to
him
till
he
comes
of
age
and
at
half
an
hour
to
sundown
he
is
to
go
for
the
cows
mind
he
do
run
sir
says
john
that
all
if
you
get
through
in
good
season
you
might
pick
over
those
potatoes
in
the
cellar
they
are
sprouting
they
ai
fit
to
john
is
obliged
to
his
father
for
if
there
is
any
sort
of
chore
more
cheerful
to
a
boy
than
another
on
a
pleasant
day
it
is
rubbing
the
sprouts
off
potatoes
in
a
dark
cellar
and
the
old
gentleman
mounts
his
wagon
and
drives
away
down
the
enticing
road
with
the
dog
bounding
along
beside
the
wagon
and
refusing
to
come
back
at
john
call
john
half
wishes
he
were
the
dog
the
dog
knows
the
part
of
farming
that
suits
him
he
likes
to
run
along
the
road
and
see
all
the
dogs
and
other
people
and
he
likes
best
of
all
to
lie
on
the
store
steps
at
the
corners
while
his
master
horse
is
dozing
at
the
post
and
his
master
is
talking
politics
in
the
store
with
the
other
dogs
of
his
acquaintance
snapping
at
mutually
annoying
flies
and
indulging
in
that
delightful
dog
gossip
which
is
expressed
by
a
wag
of
the
tail
and
a
sniff
of
the
nose
nobody
knows
how
many
dogs
characters
are
destroyed
in
this
gossip
or
how
a
dog
may
be
able
to
insinuate
suspicion
by
a
wag
of
the
tail
as
a
man
can
by
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
or
sniff
a
slander
as
a
man
can
suggest
one
by
raising
his
eyebrows
john
looks
after
the
old
gentleman
driving
off
in
state
with
the
odorous
and
the
new
whip
and
he
thinks
that
is
the
sort
of
farming
he
would
like
to
do
and
he
cries
after
his
departing
parent
father
ca
i
go
over
to
the
farther
pasture
and
salt
the
cattle
john
knows
that
he
could
spend
half
a
day
very
pleasantly
in
going
over
to
that
pasture
looking
for
bird
nests
and
shying
at
red
squirrels
on
the
way
and
who
knows
but
he
might
a
sucker
in
the
meadow
brook
and
perhaps
get
a
at
him
with
a
sharp
stick
he
knows
a
hole
where
there
is
a
whopper
and
one
of
his
plans
in
life
is
to
go
some
day
and
snare
him
and
bring
him
home
in
triumph
it
is
therefore
strongly
impressed
upon
his
mind
that
the
cattle
want
salting
but
his
father
without
turning
his
head
replies
they
do
need
salting
any
more
you
do
and
the
old
equipage
goes
rattling
down
the
road
and
john
whistles
his
disappointment
when
i
was
a
boy
on
a
farm
and
i
suppose
it
is
so
now
cattle
were
never
salted
half
enough
john
goes
to
his
chores
and
gets
through
the
stable
as
soon
as
he
can
for
that
must
be
done
but
when
it
comes
to
the
work
that
rather
drags
there
are
so
many
things
to
distract
the
attention
a
chipmunk
in
the
fence
a
bird
on
a
and
a
circling
high
in
the
air
over
the
barnyard
john
loses
a
little
time
in
stoning
the
chipmunk
which
rather
likes
the
sport
and
in
watching
the
bird
to
find
where
its
nest
is
and
he
convinces
himself
that
he
ought
to
watch
the
hawk
lest
it
pounce
upon
the
chickens
and
therefore
with
an
easy
conscience
he
spends
fifteen
minutes
in
hallooing
to
that
distant
bird
and
follows
it
away
out
of
sight
over
the
woods
and
then
wishes
it
would
come
back
again
and
then
a
carriage
with
two
horses
and
a
trunk
on
behind
goes
along
the
road
and
there
is
a
girl
in
the
carriage
who
looks
out
at
john
who
is
suddenly
aware
that
his
trousers
are
patched
on
each
knee
and
in
two
places
behind
and
he
wonders
if
she
is
rich
and
whose
name
is
on
the
trunk
and
how
much
the
horses
cost
and
whether
that
man
is
the
girl
father
and
if
that
boy
on
the
seat
with
the
driver
is
her
brother
and
if
he
has
to
do
chores
and
as
the
gay
sight
disappears
john
falls
to
thinking
about
the
great
world
beyond
the
farm
of
cities
and
people
who
are
always
dressed
up
and
a
great
many
other
things
of
which
he
has
a
very
dim
notion
and
then
a
boy
whom
john
knows
rides
by
in
a
wagon
with
his
father
and
the
boy
makes
a
face
at
john
and
john
returns
the
greeting
with
a
twist
of
his
own
visage
and
some
symbolic
gestures
all
these
things
take
time
the
work
of
cutting
down
the
big
weeds
gets
on
slowly
although
it
is
not
very
disagreeable
or
would
not
be
if
it
were
play
john
imagines
that
yonder
big
thistle
is
some
whiskered
villain
of
whom
he
has
read
in
a
fairy
book
and
he
advances
on
him
with
ruffian
and
slashes
off
his
head
with
the
or
he
charges
upon
the
rows
of
as
if
they
were
rebels
in
regimental
ranks
and
hews
them
down
without
mercy
what
fun
it
might
be
if
there
were
only
another
boy
there
to
help
but
even
war
single
handed
gets
to
be
tiresome
it
is
before
john
finishes
the
weeds
and
it
is
before
john
has
made
much
impression
on
the
garden
this
garden
john
has
no
fondness
for
he
would
rather
hoe
corn
all
day
than
work
in
it
father
seems
to
think
that
it
is
easy
work
that
john
can
do
because
it
is
near
the
house
john
continual
plan
in
this
life
is
to
go
fishing
when
there
comes
a
rainy
day
he
attempts
to
carry
it
out
but
ten
chances
to
one
his
father
has
different
views
as
it
rains
so
that
work
can
not
be
done
it
is
a
good
time
to
work
in
the
garden
he
can
run
into
the
house
between
the
heavy
showers
john
accordingly
detests
the
garden
and
the
only
time
he
works
briskly
in
it
is
when
he
has
a
stent
set
to
do
so
much
weeding
before
the
fourth
of
july
if
he
is
spry
he
can
make
an
extra
holiday
the
fourth
and
the
day
after
two
days
of
gunpowder
and
when
i
was
a
boy
i
supposed
there
was
some
connection
between
such
and
such
an
amount
of
work
done
on
the
farm
and
our
national
freedom
i
doubted
if
there
could
be
any
fourth
of
july
if
my
stent
was
not
done
i
at
least
worked
for
my
independence
iii
the
delights
of
farming
there
are
so
many
bright
spots
in
the
life
of
a
that
i
sometimes
think
i
should
like
to
live
the
life
over
again
i
should
almost
be
willing
to
be
a
girl
if
it
were
not
for
the
chores
there
is
a
great
comfort
to
a
boy
in
the
amount
of
work
he
can
get
rid
of
doing
it
is
sometimes
astonishing
how
slow
he
can
go
on
an
errand
he
who
leads
the
school
in
a
race
the
world
is
new
and
interesting
to
him
and
there
is
so
much
to
take
his
attention
off
when
he
is
sent
to
do
anything
perhaps
he
himself
could
explain
why
when
he
is
sent
to
the
neighbor
after
yeast
he
stops
to
stone
the
frogs
he
is
not
exactly
cruel
but
he
wants
to
see
if
he
can
hit
no
other
living
thing
can
go
so
slow
as
a
boy
sent
on
an
errand
his
legs
seem
to
be
lead
unless
he
happens
to
espy
a
woodchuck
in
an
adjoining
lot
when
he
gives
chase
to
it
like
a
deer
and
it
is
a
curious
fact
about
boys
that
two
will
be
a
great
deal
slower
in
doing
anything
than
one
and
that
the
more
you
have
to
help
on
a
piece
of
work
the
less
is
accomplished
boys
have
a
great
power
of
helping
each
other
to
do
nothing
and
they
are
so
innocent
about
it
and
unconscious
went
as
quick
as
ever
i
could
says
the
boy
his
father
asks
him
why
he
did
stay
all
night
when
he
has
been
absent
three
hours
on
a
errand
the
sarcasm
has
no
effect
on
the
boy
going
after
the
cows
was
a
serious
thing
in
my
day
i
had
to
climb
a
hill
which
was
covered
with
wild
strawberries
in
the
season
could
any
boy
pass
by
those
ripe
berries
and
then
in
the
fragrant
hill
pasture
there
were
beds
of
wintergreen
with
red
berries
tufts
of
columbine
roots
of
sassafras
to
be
dug
and
dozens
of
things
good
to
eat
or
to
smell
that
i
could
not
resist
it
sometimes
even
lay
in
my
way
to
climb
a
tree
to
look
for
a
crow
nest
or
to
swing
in
the
top
and
to
try
if
i
could
see
the
steeple
of
the
village
church
it
became
very
important
sometimes
for
me
to
see
that
steeple
and
in
the
midst
of
my
investigations
the
tin
horn
would
blow
a
great
blast
from
the
farmhouse
which
would
send
a
cold
chill
down
my
back
in
the
hottest
days
i
knew
what
it
meant
it
had
a
frightfully
impatient
quaver
in
it
not
at
all
like
the
sweet
note
that
called
us
to
dinner
from
the
it
said
on
earth
does
that
boy
come
home
it
is
almost
dark
and
the
cows
ai
milked
and
that
was
the
time
the
cows
had
to
start
into
a
brisk
pace
and
make
up
for
lost
time
i
wonder
if
any
boy
ever
drove
the
cows
home
late
who
did
not
say
that
the
cows
were
at
the
very
farther
end
of
the
pasture
and
that
was
hidden
in
the
woods
and
he
could
find
her
for
ever
so
long
the
brindle
cow
is
the
boy
scapegoat
many
a
time
no
other
boy
knows
how
to
appreciate
a
holiday
as
the
does
and
his
best
ones
are
of
a
peculiar
kind
going
fishing
is
of
course
one
sort
the
excitement
of
rigging
up
the
tackle
digging
the
bait
and
the
anticipation
of
great
luck
these
are
pure
pleasures
enjoyed
because
they
are
rare
boys
who
can
go
any
time
care
but
little
for
it
tramping
all
day
through
bush
and
brier
fighting
flies
and
mosquitoes
and
branches
that
tangle
the
line
and
snags
that
break
the
hook
and
returning
home
late
and
hungry
with
wet
feet
and
a
string
of
speckled
trout
on
a
willow
twig
and
having
the
family
crowd
out
at
the
kitchen
door
to
look
at
and
say
well
done
for
you
bub
did
you
catch
that
big
one
yourself
this
is
also
pure
happiness
the
like
of
which
the
boy
will
never
have
again
not
if
he
comes
to
be
selectman
and
deacon
and
to
but
the
holidays
i
recall
with
delight
were
the
two
days
in
spring
and
fall
when
we
went
to
the
distant
in
a
neighboring
town
maybe
to
drive
thither
the
young
cattle
and
colts
and
to
bring
them
back
again
it
was
a
wild
and
rocky
upland
where
our
great
pasture
was
many
miles
from
home
the
road
to
it
running
by
a
brawling
river
and
up
a
dashing
among
great
hills
what
a
day
adventure
it
was
it
was
like
a
journey
to
europe
the
night
before
i
could
scarcely
sleep
for
thinking
of
it
and
there
was
no
trouble
about
getting
me
up
at
sunrise
that
morning
the
breakfast
was
eaten
the
luncheon
was
packed
in
a
large
basket
with
bottles
of
root
beer
and
a
jug
of
switchel
which
packing
i
superintended
with
the
greatest
interest
and
then
the
cattle
were
to
be
collected
for
the
march
and
the
horses
hitched
up
did
i
shirk
any
duty
was
i
slow
i
think
not
i
was
willing
to
run
my
legs
off
after
the
frisky
steers
who
seemed
to
have
an
idea
they
were
going
on
a
lark
and
frolicked
about
dashing
into
all
gates
and
through
all
bars
except
the
right
ones
and
how
cheerfully
i
did
yell
at
them
it
was
a
glorious
chance
to
and
i
have
never
since
heard
any
public
speaker
on
the
stump
or
at
who
could
make
more
noise
i
have
often
thought
it
fortunate
that
the
amount
of
noise
in
a
boy
does
not
increase
in
proportion
to
his
size
if
it
did
the
world
could
not
contain
it
the
whole
day
was
full
of
excitement
and
of
freedom
we
were
away
from
the
farm
which
to
a
boy
is
one
of
the
best
parts
of
farming
we
saw
other
farms
and
other
people
at
work
i
had
the
pleasure
of
marching
along
and
swinging
my
whip
past
boys
whom
i
knew
who
were
picking
up
stones
every
turn
of
the
road
every
bend
and
rapid
of
the
river
the
great
bowlders
by
the
wayside
the
the
giant
pine
that
had
been
struck
by
lightning
the
mysterious
covered
bridge
over
the
river
where
it
was
most
swift
and
rocky
and
foamy
the
chance
eagle
in
the
blue
sky
the
sense
of
going
somewhere
why
as
i
recall
all
these
things
i
feel
that
even
the
prince
imperial
as
he
used
to
dash
on
horseback
through
the
bois
de
boulogne
with
fifty
mounted
hussars
clattering
at
his
heels
and
crowds
of
people
cheering
could
not
have
been
as
happy
as
was
i
a
boy
in
short
jacket
and
shorter
pantaloons
trudging
in
the
dust
that
day
behind
the
steers
and
colts
cracking
my
whip
i
wish
the
journey
would
never
end
but
at
last
by
noon
we
reach
the
pastures
and
turn
in
the
herd
and
after
making
the
tour
of
the
lots
to
make
sure
there
are
no
breaks
in
the
fences
we
take
our
luncheon
from
the
wagon
and
eat
it
under
the
trees
by
the
spring
this
is
the
supreme
moment
of
the
day
this
is
the
way
to
live
this
is
like
the
swiss
family
robinson
and
all
the
rest
of
my
delightful
acquaintances
in
romance
baked
beans
bread
moist
remember
doughnuts
and
cheese
pie
and
root
beer
what
richness
you
may
live
to
dine
at
delmonico
or
if
those
frenchmen
do
not
eat
each
other
up
at
philippe
in
rue
montorgueil
in
paris
where
the
dear
old
thackeray
used
to
eat
as
good
a
dinner
as
anybody
but
you
will
get
there
neither
doughnuts
nor
pie
nor
root
beer
nor
anything
so
good
as
that
luncheon
at
noon
in
the
old
pasture
high
among
the
massachusetts
hills
nor
will
you
ever
if
you
live
to
be
the
oldest
boy
in
the
world
have
any
holiday
equal
to
the
one
i
have
described
but
i
always
regretted
that
i
did
not
take
along
a
fishline
just
to
the
brook
we
passed
i
know
there
were
trout
there
iv
no
farming
without
a
boy
say
what
you
will
about
the
general
usefulness
of
boys
it
is
my
impression
that
a
farm
without
a
boy
would
very
soon
come
to
grief
what
the
boy
does
is
the
life
of
the
farm
he
is
the
factotum
always
in
demand
always
expected
to
do
the
thousand
indispensable
things
that
nobody
else
will
do
upon
him
fall
all
the
odds
and
ends
the
most
difficult
things
after
everybody
else
is
through
he
has
to
finish
up
his
work
is
like
a
woman
perpetual
waiting
on
others
everybody
knows
how
much
easier
it
is
to
eat
a
good
dinner
than
it
is
to
wash
the
dishes
afterwards
consider
what
a
boy
on
a
farm
is
required
to
do
things
that
must
be
done
or
life
would
actually
stop
it
is
understood
in
the
first
place
that
he
is
to
do
all
the
errands
to
go
to
the
store
to
the
post
office
and
to
carry
all
sorts
of
messages
if
he
had
as
many
legs
as
a
centipede
they
would
tire
before
night
his
two
short
limbs
seem
to
him
entirely
inadequate
to
the
task
he
would
like
to
have
as
many
legs
as
a
wheel
has
spokes
and
rotate
about
in
the
same
way
this
he
sometimes
tries
to
do
and
people
who
have
seen
him
along
the
side
of
the
road
have
supposed
that
he
was
amusing
himself
and
idling
his
time
he
was
only
trying
to
invent
a
new
mode
of
locomotion
so
that
he
could
economize
his
legs
and
do
his
errands
with
greater
dispatch
he
practices
standing
on
his
head
in
order
to
accustom
himself
to
any
position
leapfrog
is
one
of
his
methods
of
getting
over
the
ground
quickly
he
would
willingly
go
an
errand
any
distance
if
he
could
it
with
a
few
other
boys
he
has
a
natural
genius
for
combining
pleasure
with
business
this
is
the
reason
why
when
he
is
sent
to
the
spring
for
a
pitcher
of
water
and
the
family
are
waiting
at
the
he
is
absent
so
long
for
he
stops
to
poke
the
frog
that
sits
on
the
stone
or
if
there
is
a
penstock
to
put
his
hand
over
the
spout
and
squirt
the
water
a
little
while
he
is
the
one
who
spreads
the
grass
when
the
men
have
cut
it
he
mows
it
away
in
the
barn
he
rides
the
horse
to
cultivate
the
corn
up
and
down
the
hot
weary
rows
he
picks
up
the
potatoes
when
they
are
dug
he
drives
the
cows
night
and
morning
he
brings
wood
and
water
and
splits
kindling
he
gets
up
the
horse
and
puts
out
the
horse
whether
he
is
in
the
house
or
out
of
it
there
is
always
something
for
him
to
do
just
before
school
in
winter
he
shovels
paths
in
summer
he
turns
the
grindstone
he
knows
where
there
are
lots
of
and
sweet
but
instead
of
going
for
them
he
is
to
stay
and
pare
apples
and
stone
raisins
and
pound
something
in
a
mortar
and
yet
with
his
mind
full
of
schemes
of
what
he
would
like
to
do
and
his
hands
full
of
occupations
he
is
an
idle
boy
who
has
nothing
to
busy
himself
with
but
school
and
chores
he
would
gladly
do
all
the
work
if
somebody
else
would
do
the
chores
he
thinks
and
yet
i
doubt
if
any
boy
ever
amounted
to
anything
in
the
world
or
was
of
much
use
as
a
man
who
did
not
enjoy
the
advantages
of
a
liberal
education
in
the
way
of
chores
a
boy
on
a
farm
is
nothing
without
his
pets
at
least
a
dog
and
probably
rabbits
chickens
ducks
and
a
suits
a
boy
it
is
entirely
useless
and
makes
a
more
disagreeable
noise
than
a
chinese
gong
i
once
domesticated
a
young
fox
which
a
neighbor
had
caught
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
the
fox
can
not
be
tamed
jacko
was
a
very
clever
little
animal
and
behaved
in
all
respects
with
propriety
he
kept
sunday
as
well
as
any
day
and
all
the
ten
commandments
that
he
could
understand
he
was
a
very
graceful
playfellow
and
seemed
to
have
an
affection
for
me
he
lived
in
a
in
the
dooryard
and
when
i
lay
down
at
the
entrance
to
his
house
and
called
him
he
would
come
out
and
sit
on
his
tail
and
lick
my
face
just
like
a
grown
person
i
taught
him
a
great
many
tricks
and
all
the
virtues
that
year
i
had
a
large
number
of
hens
and
jacko
went
about
among
them
with
the
most
perfect
indifference
never
looking
on
them
to
lust
after
them
as
i
could
see
and
never
touching
an
egg
or
a
feather
so
excellent
was
his
reputation
that
i
would
have
trusted
him
in
the
in
the
dark
without
counting
the
hens
in
short
he
was
domesticated
and
i
was
fond
of
him
and
very
proud
of
him
exhibiting
him
to
all
our
visitors
as
an
example
of
what
affectionate
treatment
would
do
in
subduing
the
brute
instincts
i
preferred
him
to
my
dog
whom
i
had
with
much
patience
taught
to
go
up
a
long
hill
alone
and
surround
the
cows
and
drive
them
home
from
the
remote
pasture
he
liked
the
fun
of
it
at
first
but
by
and
by
he
seemed
to
get
the
notion
that
it
was
a
and
when
i
whistled
for
him
to
go
for
the
cows
he
would
turn
tail
and
run
the
other
way
and
the
more
i
whistled
and
threw
stones
at
him
the
faster
he
would
run
his
name
was
turk
and
i
should
have
sold
him
if
he
had
not
been
the
kind
of
dog
that
nobody
will
buy
i
suppose
he
was
not
a
but
what
they
call
a
at
least
when
he
got
big
enough
he
used
to
get
into
the
pasture
and
chase
the
sheep
to
death
that
was
the
way
he
got
into
trouble
and
lost
his
valuable
life
a
dog
is
of
great
use
on
a
farm
and
that
is
the
reason
a
boy
likes
him
he
is
good
to
bite
peddlers
and
small
children
and
run
out
and
yelp
at
wagons
that
pass
by
and
to
howl
all
night
when
the
moon
shines
and
yet
if
i
were
a
boy
again
the
first
thing
i
would
have
should
be
a
dog
for
dogs
are
great
companions
and
as
active
and
spry
as
a
boy
at
doing
nothing
they
are
also
good
to
bark
at
a
good
dog
will
bark
at
a
long
after
the
animal
has
retired
to
a
remote
part
of
his
residence
and
escaped
by
another
hole
this
deceives
the
woodchuck
some
of
the
most
delightful
hours
of
my
life
have
been
spent
in
hiding
and
watching
the
hole
where
the
dog
was
not
what
an
exquisite
thrill
ran
through
my
frame
when
the
timid
nose
appeared
was
withdrawn
poked
out
again
and
finally
followed
by
the
entire
animal
who
looked
cautiously
about
and
then
hopped
away
to
feed
on
the
clover
at
that
moment
i
rushed
in
occupied
the
base
yelled
to
turk
and
then
danced
with
delight
at
the
combat
between
the
spunky
woodchuck
and
the
dog
they
were
about
the
same
size
but
science
and
civilization
won
the
day
i
did
not
reflect
then
that
it
would
have
been
more
in
the
interest
of
civilization
if
the
woodchuck
had
killed
the
dog
i
do
not
know
why
it
is
that
boys
so
like
to
hunt
and
kill
animals
but
the
excuse
that
i
gave
in
this
case
for
the
murder
was
that
the
woodchuck
ate
the
clover
and
trod
it
down
and
in
fact
was
a
woodchuck
it
was
not
till
long
after
that
i
learned
with
surprise
that
he
is
a
rodent
mammal
of
the
species
arctomys
monax
is
called
at
the
west
a
and
is
eaten
by
people
of
color
with
great
relish
but
i
have
forgotten
my
beautiful
fox
jacko
continued
to
deport
himself
well
until
the
young
chickens
came
he
was
actually
cured
of
the
fox
vice
of
he
used
to
go
with
me
about
the
coops
pricking
up
his
ears
in
an
intelligent
manner
and
with
a
demure
eye
and
the
most
virtuous
droop
of
the
tail
charming
fox
if
he
had
held
out
a
little
while
longer
i
should
have
put
him
into
a
book
but
i
began
to
miss
chickens
they
disappeared
mysteriously
in
the
night
i
would
not
suspect
jacko
at
first
for
he
looked
so
honest
and
in
the
daytime
seemed
to
be
as
much
interested
in
the
chickens
as
i
was
but
one
morning
when
i
went
to
call
him
i
found
feathers
at
the
entrance
of
his
hole
chicken
feathers
he
could
deny
it
he
was
a
thief
his
fox
nature
had
come
out
under
severe
temptation
and
he
died
an
unnatural
death
he
had
a
thousand
virtues
and
one
crime
but
that
crime
struck
at
the
foundation
of
society
he
deceived
and
stole
he
was
a
liar
and
a
thief
and
no
pretty
ways
could
hide
the
fact
his
intelligent
bright
face
could
save
him
if
he
had
been
honest
he
might
have
grown
up
to
be
a
large
ornamental
fox
the
boy
sunday
sunday
in
the
new
england
hill
towns
used
to
begin
saturday
night
at
sundown
and
the
sun
is
lost
to
sight
behind
the
hills
there
before
it
has
set
by
the
almanac
i
remember
that
we
used
to
go
by
the
almanac
saturday
night
and
by
the
visible
disappearance
sunday
night
on
saturday
night
we
very
slowly
yielded
to
the
influences
of
the
holy
time
which
were
settling
down
upon
us
and
submitted
to
the
ablutions
which
were
as
inevitable
as
sunday
but
when
the
sun
and
it
never
moved
so
slow
slid
behind
the
hills
sunday
night
the
effect
upon
the
watching
boy
was
like
a
shock
from
a
galvanic
battery
something
flashed
through
all
his
limbs
and
set
them
in
motion
and
no
ever
seemed
so
sweet
to
him
as
that
between
sundown
and
dark
sunday
night
this
however
was
on
the
supposition
that
he
had
conscientiously
kept
sunday
and
had
not
gone
in
swimming
and
got
drowned
this
keeping
of
saturday
night
instead
of
sunday
night
we
did
not
very
well
understand
but
it
seemed
on
the
whole
a
good
thing
that
we
should
rest
saturday
night
when
we
were
tired
and
play
sunday
night
when
we
were
rested
i
supposed
however
that
it
was
an
arrangement
made
to
suit
the
big
boys
who
wanted
to
go
sunday
night
certainly
they
were
not
to
be
blamed
for
sunday
was
the
day
when
pretty
girls
were
most
fascinating
and
i
have
never
since
seen
any
so
lovely
as
those
who
used
to
sit
in
the
gallery
and
in
the
singers
seats
in
the
bare
old
sunday
to
the
country
was
hardly
the
relief
that
it
was
to
the
other
members
of
the
family
for
the
same
chores
must
be
done
that
day
as
on
others
and
he
could
not
divert
his
mind
with
whistling
or
sending
the
dog
into
the
river
after
sticks
he
had
to
submit
in
the
first
place
to
the
restraint
of
shoes
and
stockings
he
read
in
the
old
testament
that
when
moses
came
to
holy
ground
he
put
off
his
shoes
but
the
boy
was
obliged
to
put
his
on
upon
the
holy
day
not
only
to
go
to
meeting
but
while
he
sat
at
home
only
the
emancipated
who
is
as
agile
on
his
bare
feet
as
a
young
kid
and
rejoices
in
the
pressure
of
the
warm
soft
earth
knows
what
a
hardship
it
is
to
tie
on
stiff
shoes
the
monks
who
put
peas
in
their
shoes
as
a
penance
do
not
suffer
more
than
the
in
his
penitential
sunday
shoes
i
recall
the
celerity
with
which
he
used
to
kick
them
off
at
sundown
sunday
morning
was
not
an
idle
one
for
the
he
must
rise
tolerably
early
for
the
cows
were
to
be
milked
and
driven
to
pasture
family
prayers
were
a
little
longer
than
on
other
days
there
were
the
verses
to
be
relearned
for
they
did
not
stay
in
mind
over
night
perhaps
the
wagon
was
to
be
greased
before
the
neighbors
began
to
drive
by
and
the
horse
was
to
be
caught
out
of
the
pasture
ridden
home
bareback
and
harnessed
this
catching
the
horse
perhaps
two
of
them
was
very
good
fun
usually
and
would
have
broken
the
sunday
if
the
horse
had
not
been
wanted
for
taking
the
family
to
meeting
it
was
so
peaceful
and
still
in
the
pasture
on
sunday
morning
but
the
horses
were
never
so
playful
the
colts
never
so
frisky
round
and
round
the
lot
the
boy
went
calling
in
an
entreating
sunday
voice
jock
jock
jock
and
shaking
his
while
the
horses
with
heads
erect
and
shaking
tails
and
flashing
heels
dashed
from
corner
to
corner
and
gave
the
boy
a
pretty
good
race
before
he
could
coax
the
nose
of
one
of
them
into
his
dish
the
boy
got
angry
and
came
very
near
saying
it
but
he
rather
enjoyed
the
fun
after
all
the
boy
remembers
how
his
mother
anxiety
was
divided
between
the
set
of
his
collar
the
parting
of
his
hair
and
his
memory
of
the
verses
and
what
a
wild
confusion
there
was
through
the
house
in
getting
off
for
meeting
and
how
he
was
kept
running
hither
and
thither
to
get
the
or
a
fan
or
the
best
whip
or
to
pick
from
the
sunday
part
of
the
garden
the
bunch
of
already
the
deacon
mare
with
a
of
the
deacon
folks
had
gone
shambling
past
head
and
tail
drooping
clumsy
hoofs
kicking
up
clouds
of
dust
while
the
good
deacon
sat
jerking
the
reins
in
an
automatic
way
and
the
patiently
saw
the
dust
settle
upon
their
best
summer
finery
wagon
after
wagon
went
along
the
sandy
road
and
when
our
boy
family
started
they
became
part
of
a
long
procession
which
sent
up
a
mile
of
dust
and
a
pungent
if
not
pious
smell
of
there
were
fiery
horses
in
the
trail
which
had
to
be
held
in
for
it
was
neither
etiquette
nor
decent
to
pass
anybody
on
sunday
it
was
a
great
delight
to
the
to
see
all
this
procession
of
horses
and
to
exchange
sly
winks
with
the
other
boys
who
leaned
over
the
for
that
purpose
occasionally
a
boy
rode
behind
with
his
back
to
the
family
and
his
pantomime
was
always
some
thing
wonderful
to
see
and
was
considered
very
daring
and
wicked
the
which
our
boy
remembers
was
a
high
square
building
without
a
steeple
within
it
had
a
lofty
pulpit
with
doors
underneath
and
closets
where
sacred
things
were
kept
and
where
the
were
supposed
to
imprison
bad
boys
the
pews
were
square
with
seats
facing
each
other
those
on
one
side
low
for
the
children
and
all
with
hinges
so
that
they
could
be
raised
when
the
congregation
stood
up
for
prayers
and
leaned
over
the
backs
of
the
pews
as
horses
meet
each
other
across
a
pasture
fence
after
prayers
these
seats
used
to
be
slammed
down
with
a
clatter
which
seemed
to
the
boys
about
the
best
part
of
the
exercises
the
galleries
were
very
high
and
the
singers
seats
where
the
pretty
girls
sat
were
the
most
conspicuous
of
all
to
sit
in
the
gallery
away
from
the
family
was
a
privilege
not
often
granted
to
the
boy
the
who
carried
a
long
rod
and
kept
order
in
the
house
and
at
noontime
sat
in
the
gallery
and
visited
any
boy
who
whispered
or
found
curious
passages
in
the
bible
and
showed
them
to
another
boy
it
was
an
awful
moment
when
the
approached
a
boy
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
congregation
were
on
him
and
he
could
feel
the
guilt
ooze
out
of
his
burning
face
at
noon
was
and
after
that
before
the
afternoon
service
in
summer
the
boys
had
a
little
time
to
eat
their
luncheon
together
at
the
where
some
of
the
elders
were
likely
to
be
gathered
talking
very
solemnly
about
cattle
or
they
went
over
to
a
neighboring
barn
to
see
the
calves
or
they
slipped
off
down
the
roadside
to
a
place
where
they
could
dig
sassafras
or
the
root
of
the
roots
very
fragrant
in
the
mind
of
many
a
boy
with
religious
associations
to
this
day
there
was
often
an
odor
of
sassafras
in
the
afternoon
service
it
used
to
stand
in
my
mind
as
a
substitute
for
the
old
testament
incense
of
the
jews
something
in
the
same
way
the
big
in
the
choir
took
the
place
of
harp
of
solemn
the
going
home
from
meeting
was
more
cheerful
and
lively
than
the
coming
to
it
there
was
all
the
bustle
of
getting
the
horses
out
of
the
sheds
and
bringing
them
round
to
the
steps
at
noon
the
boys
sometimes
sat
in
the
wagons
and
swung
the
whips
without
cracking
them
now
it
was
permitted
to
give
them
a
little
snap
in
order
to
bring
the
horses
up
in
good
style
and
the
boy
was
rather
proud
of
the
horse
if
it
pranced
a
little
while
the
timid
were
trying
to
get
in
the
boy
had
an
eye
for
whatever
life
and
stir
there
was
in
a
new
england
sunday
he
liked
to
drive
home
fast
the
old
house
and
the
farm
looked
pleasant
to
him
there
was
an
extra
dinner
when
they
reached
home
and
a
cheerful
consciousness
of
duty
performed
made
it
a
pleasant
dinner
long
before
sundown
the
book
had
been
read
and
the
boy
sat
waiting
in
the
house
with
great
impatience
the
signal
that
the
of
was
over
a
boy
may
not
be
very
wicked
and
yet
not
see
the
need
of
neither
his
idea
of
rest
nor
work
is
that
of
older
farmers
vi
the
grindstone
of
life
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
that
hardens
the
lot
of
the
it
is
the
grindstone
turning
grindstones
to
grind
scythes
is
one
of
those
heroic
but
unobtrusive
occupations
for
which
one
gets
no
credit
it
is
a
hopeless
kind
of
task
and
however
faithfully
the
crank
is
turned
it
is
one
that
brings
little
reputation
there
is
a
great
deal
of
poetry
about
haying
i
mean
for
those
not
engaged
in
it
one
likes
to
hear
the
whetting
of
the
scythes
on
a
fresh
morning
and
the
response
of
the
noisy
bobolink
who
always
sits
upon
the
fence
and
superintends
the
cutting
of
the
grass
there
is
a
sort
of
music
in
the
and
a
rhythm
in
the
swing
of
the
scythes
in
concert
the
boy
has
not
much
time
to
attend
to
it
for
it
is
lively
business
after
half
a
dozen
men
who
have
only
to
walk
along
and
lay
the
grass
low
while
the
boy
has
the
whole
on
his
hands
he
has
little
time
for
the
poetry
of
haying
as
he
struggles
along
filling
the
air
with
the
wet
mass
which
he
shakes
over
his
head
and
picking
his
way
with
short
legs
and
bare
feet
amid
the
short
and
freshly
cut
stubble
but
if
the
scythes
cut
well
and
swing
merrily
it
is
due
to
the
boy
who
turned
the
grindstone
oh
it
was
nothing
to
do
just
turn
the
grindstone
a
few
minutes
for
this
and
that
one
before
breakfast
any
was
authorized
to
order
the
boy
to
turn
the
grindstone
how
they
did
bear
on
those
great
strapping
fellows
turn
turn
turn
what
a
weary
go
it
was
for
my
part
i
used
to
like
a
grindstone
that
a
good
deal
on
its
axis
for
when
i
turned
it
fast
it
put
the
grinder
on
a
lively
lookout
for
cutting
his
hands
and
entirely
satisfied
his
desire
that
i
should
it
was
some
sport
to
make
the
water
fly
and
wet
the
grinder
suddenly
starting
up
quickly
and
surprising
him
when
i
was
turning
very
slowly
i
used
to
wish
sometimes
that
i
could
turn
fast
enough
to
make
the
stone
fly
into
a
dozen
pieces
steady
turning
is
what
the
grinders
like
and
any
boy
who
turns
steadily
so
as
to
give
an
even
motion
to
the
stone
will
be
much
praised
and
will
be
in
demand
i
advise
any
boy
who
desires
to
do
this
sort
of
work
to
turn
steadily
if
he
does
it
by
jerks
and
in
a
fitful
manner
the
will
be
very
apt
to
dispense
with
his
services
and
turn
the
grindstone
for
each
other
this
is
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
tasks
of
the
boy
farmer
and
hard
as
it
is
i
do
not
know
why
it
is
supposed
to
belong
especially
to
childhood
but
it
is
and
one
of
the
certain
marks
that
second
childhood
has
come
to
a
man
on
a
farm
is
that
he
is
asked
to
turn
the
grindstone
as
if
he
were
a
boy
again
when
the
old
man
is
good
for
nothing
else
when
he
can
neither
mow
nor
pitch
and
scarcely
after
he
can
turn
grindstone
and
it
is
in
this
way
that
he
renews
his
youth
you
ashamed
to
have
your
granther
turn
the
grindstone
asks
the
hired
man
of
the
boy
so
the
boy
takes
hold
and
turns
himself
till
his
little
back
aches
when
he
gets
older
he
wishes
he
had
replied
you
ashamed
to
make
either
an
old
man
or
a
little
boy
do
such
hard
grinding
work
doing
the
regular
work
of
this
world
is
not
much
the
boy
thinks
but
the
wearisome
part
is
the
waiting
on
the
people
who
do
the
work
and
the
boy
is
not
far
wrong
this
is
what
women
and
boys
have
to
do
on
a
farm
wait
upon
everybody
who
works
the
trouble
with
the
boy
life
is
that
he
has
no
time
that
he
can
call
his
own
he
is
like
a
barrel
of
beer
always
on
draft
the
having
worked
in
the
regular
hours
lie
down
and
rest
stretch
themselves
idly
in
the
shade
at
noon
or
lounge
about
after
supper
then
the
boy
who
has
done
nothing
all
day
but
turn
grindstone
and
spread
hay
and
rake
after
and
run
his
little
legs
off
at
everybody
beck
and
call
is
sent
on
some
errand
or
some
household
chore
in
order
that
time
shall
not
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
the
boy
comes
nearer
to
perpetual
motion
than
anything
else
in
nature
only
it
is
not
altogether
a
voluntary
motion
the
time
that
the
gets
for
his
own
is
usually
at
the
end
of
a
stent
we
used
to
be
given
a
certain
piece
of
corn
to
hoe
or
a
certain
quantity
of
corn
to
husk
in
so
many
days
if
we
finished
the
task
before
the
time
set
we
had
the
remainder
to
ourselves
in
my
day
it
used
to
take
very
sharp
work
to
gain
anything
but
we
were
always
anxious
to
take
the
chance
i
think
we
enjoyed
the
holiday
in
anticipation
quite
as
much
as
we
did
when
we
had
won
it
unless
it
was
or
fourth
of
july
or
the
circus
was
coming
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
find
anything
big
enough
to
fill
our
anticipations
of
the
fun
we
would
have
in
the
day
or
the
two
or
three
days
we
had
earned
we
did
not
want
to
waste
the
time
on
any
common
thing
even
going
fishing
in
one
of
the
wild
mountain
brooks
was
hardly
up
to
the
mark
for
we
could
sometimes
do
that
on
a
rainy
day
going
down
to
the
village
store
was
not
very
exciting
and
was
on
the
whole
a
waste
of
our
precious
time
unless
we
could
get
out
our
military
company
life
was
apt
to
be
a
little
blank
even
on
the
holidays
for
which
we
had
worked
so
hard
if
you
went
to
see
another
boy
he
was
probably
at
work
in
the
or
the
and
his
father
looked
at
you
askance
you
sometimes
took
hold
and
helped
him
so
that
he
could
go
and
play
with
you
but
it
was
usually
time
to
go
for
the
cows
before
the
task
was
done
the
fact
is
or
used
to
be
that
the
amusements
of
a
boy
in
the
country
are
not
many
snaring
out
of
the
deep
meadow
brook
used
to
be
about
as
good
as
any
that
i
had
the
north
american
sucker
is
not
an
engaging
animal
in
all
respects
his
body
is
comely
enough
but
his
mouth
is
puckered
up
like
that
of
a
purse
the
mouth
is
not
formed
for
the
gentle
nor
the
delusive
fly
of
the
fishermen
it
is
necessary
therefore
to
snare
the
fish
if
you
want
him
in
the
sunny
days
he
lies
in
the
deep
pools
by
some
big
stone
or
near
the
bank
poising
himself
quite
still
or
only
stirring
his
fins
a
little
now
and
then
as
an
elephant
moves
his
ears
he
will
lie
so
for
hours
or
rather
float
in
perfect
idleness
and
apparent
bliss
the
boy
who
also
has
a
holiday
but
can
not
keep
still
comes
along
and
peeps
over
the
bank
ai
he
a
big
one
perhaps
he
is
eighteen
inches
long
and
weighs
two
or
three
pounds
he
lies
there
among
his
friends
little
fish
and
big
ones
quite
a
school
of
them
perhaps
a
district
school
that
only
keeps
in
warm
days
in
the
summer
the
pupils
seem
to
have
little
to
learn
except
to
balance
themselves
and
to
turn
gracefully
with
a
flirt
of
the
tail
not
much
is
taught
but
and
some
of
the
old
suckers
are
perfect
turveydrops
in
that
the
boy
is
armed
with
a
pole
and
a
stout
line
and
on
the
end
of
it
a
brass
wire
bent
into
a
hoop
which
is
a
slipnoose
and
slides
together
when
anything
is
caught
in
it
the
boy
approaches
the
bank
and
looks
over
there
he
lies
calm
as
a
whale
the
boy
devours
him
with
his
eyes
he
is
almost
too
much
excited
to
drop
the
snare
into
the
water
without
making
a
noise
a
puff
of
wind
comes
and
ruffles
the
surface
so
that
he
can
not
see
the
fish
it
is
calm
again
and
there
he
still
is
moving
his
fins
in
peaceful
security
the
boy
lowers
his
snare
behind
the
fish
and
slips
it
along
he
intends
to
get
it
around
him
just
back
of
the
gills
and
then
elevate
him
with
a
sudden
jerk
it
is
a
delicate
operation
for
the
snare
will
turn
a
little
and
if
it
hits
the
fish
he
is
off
however
it
goes
well
the
wire
is
almost
in
place
when
suddenly
the
fish
as
if
he
had
a
warning
in
a
dream
for
he
appears
to
see
nothing
moves
his
tail
just
a
little
glides
out
of
the
loop
and
with
no
seeming
appearance
of
frustrating
any
one
plans
lounges
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
pool
and
there
he
reposes
just
as
if
he
was
not
spoiling
the
boy
holiday
this
slight
change
of
base
on
the
part
of
the
fish
requires
the
boy
to
reorganize
his
whole
campaign
get
a
new
position
on
the
bank
a
new
line
of
approach
and
patiently
wait
for
the
wind
and
sun
before
he
can
lower
his
line
this
time
cunning
and
patience
are
rewarded
the
hoop
encircles
the
unsuspecting
fish
the
boy
eyes
almost
start
from
his
head
as
he
gives
a
tremendous
jerk
and
feels
by
the
that
he
has
got
him
fast
out
he
comes
up
he
goes
in
the
air
and
the
boy
runs
to
look
at
him
in
this
transaction
however
no
one
can
be
more
surprised
than
the
sucker
vii
fiction
and
sentiment
the
boy
farmer
does
not
appreciate
school
vacations
as
highly
as
his
city
cousin
when
school
keeps
he
has
only
to
chores
and
go
to
school
but
between
terms
there
are
a
thousand
things
on
the
farm
that
have
been
left
for
the
boy
to
do
picking
up
stones
in
the
pastures
and
piling
them
in
heaps
used
to
be
one
of
them
some
lots
appeared
to
grow
stones
or
else
the
sun
every
year
drew
them
to
the
surface
as
it
coaxes
the
round
cantelopes
out
of
the
soft
garden
soil
it
is
certain
that
there
were
fields
that
always
gave
the
boys
this
sort
of
fall
work
and
very
lively
work
it
was
on
frosty
mornings
for
the
barefooted
boys
who
were
continually
turning
up
the
larger
stones
in
order
to
stand
for
a
moment
in
the
warm
place
that
had
been
covered
from
the
frost
a
boy
can
stand
on
one
leg
as
well
as
a
holland
stork
and
the
boy
who
found
a
warm
spot
for
the
sole
of
his
foot
was
likely
to
stand
in
it
until
the
words
stir
your
stumps
broke
in
discordantly
upon
his
meditations
for
the
boy
is
very
much
given
to
meditations
if
he
had
his
way
he
would
do
nothing
in
a
hurry
he
likes
to
stop
and
think
about
things
and
enjoy
his
work
as
he
goes
along
he
picks
up
potatoes
as
if
each
one
were
a
lump
of
gold
just
turned
out
of
the
dirt
and
requiring
careful
examination
although
the
feels
a
little
joy
when
school
breaks
up
as
he
does
when
anything
breaks
up
or
any
change
takes
place
since
he
is
released
from
the
discipline
and
restraint
of
it
yet
the
school
is
his
opening
into
the
world
his
romance
its
opportunities
for
enjoyment
are
numberless
he
does
not
exactly
know
what
he
is
set
at
books
for
he
takes
spelling
rather
as
an
exercise
for
his
lungs
standing
up
and
shouting
out
the
words
with
entire
recklessness
of
consequences
he
grapples
doggedly
with
arithmetic
and
geography
as
something
that
must
be
cleared
out
of
his
way
before
recess
but
not
at
all
with
the
zest
he
would
dig
a
woodchuck
out
of
his
hole
but
recess
was
ever
any
enjoyment
so
keen
as
that
with
which
a
boy
rushes
out
of
the
schoolhouse
door
for
the
ten
minutes
of
recess
he
is
like
to
burst
with
animal
spirits
he
runs
like
a
deer
he
can
nearly
fly
and
he
throws
himself
into
play
with
entire
and
an
energy
that
would
overturn
the
world
if
his
strength
were
proportioned
to
it
for
ten
minutes
the
world
is
absolutely
his
the
weights
are
taken
off
restraints
are
loosed
and
he
is
his
own
master
for
that
brief
time
as
he
never
again
will
be
if
he
lives
to
be
as
old
as
the
king
of
thule
and
nobody
knows
how
old
he
was
and
there
is
the
nooning
a
solid
hour
in
which
vast
projects
can
be
carried
out
which
have
been
slyly
matured
during
the
expeditions
are
undertaken
wars
are
begun
between
the
indians
on
one
side
and
the
settlers
on
the
other
the
military
company
is
drilled
without
uniforms
or
arms
or
games
are
carried
on
which
involve
miles
of
running
and
an
expenditure
of
wind
sufficient
to
spell
the
through
at
the
highest
pitch
friendships
are
formed
too
which
are
fervent
if
not
enduring
and
enmities
contracted
which
are
frequently
on
the
spot
after
a
rough
fashion
boys
have
of
settling
as
they
go
along
cases
of
long
credit
either
in
words
or
trade
are
not
frequent
with
boys
boot
on
must
be
paid
on
the
nail
and
it
is
considered
much
more
honorable
to
out
with
a
personal
grievance
at
once
even
if
the
explanation
is
made
with
the
fists
than
to
pretend
fair
and
then
take
a
sneaking
revenge
on
some
concealed
opportunity
the
at
the
district
school
is
introduced
into
a
wider
world
than
he
knew
at
home
in
many
ways
some
big
boy
brings
to
school
a
copy
of
the
arabian
nights
a
copy
with
cover
and
the
last
leaves
missing
which
is
passed
around
and
slyly
read
under
the
desk
and
perhaps
comes
to
the
little
boy
whose
parents
disapprove
of
and
have
no
work
of
fiction
in
the
house
except
a
pious
fraud
called
months
in
a
convent
and
the
latest
comic
almanac
the
boy
eyes
dilate
as
he
steals
some
of
the
treasures
out
of
the
wondrous
pages
and
he
longs
to
lose
himself
in
the
land
of
enchantment
open
before
him
he
tells
at
home
that
he
has
seen
the
most
wonderful
book
that
ever
was
and
a
big
boy
has
promised
to
lend
it
to
him
it
a
true
book
john
asks
the
grandmother
if
it
is
true
it
is
the
worst
thing
that
a
boy
can
this
happened
years
ago
john
can
not
answer
as
to
the
truth
of
the
book
and
so
does
not
bring
it
home
but
he
borrows
it
nevertheless
and
conceals
it
in
the
barn
and
lying
in
the
is
lost
in
its
enchantments
many
an
odd
hour
when
he
is
supposed
to
be
doing
chores
there
were
no
chores
in
the
arabian
nights
the
boy
there
had
but
to
rub
the
ring
and
summon
a
genius
who
would
feed
the
calves
and
pick
up
chips
and
bring
in
wood
in
a
minute
it
was
through
this
emblazoned
portal
that
the
boy
walked
into
the
world
of
books
which
he
soon
found
was
larger
than
his
own
and
filled
with
people
he
longed
to
know
and
the
is
not
without
his
sentiment
and
his
secrets
though
he
has
never
been
at
a
children
party
in
his
life
and
in
fact
never
has
heard
that
children
go
into
society
when
they
are
seven
and
give
regular
when
they
reach
the
ripe
age
of
nine
but
one
of
his
regrets
at
having
the
summer
school
close
is
dimly
connected
with
a
little
girl
whom
he
does
not
care
much
for
would
a
great
deal
rather
play
with
a
boy
than
with
her
at
recess
but
whom
he
will
not
see
again
for
some
time
a
sweet
little
thing
who
is
very
friendly
with
john
and
with
whom
he
has
been
known
to
exchange
bits
of
candy
wrapped
up
in
paper
and
for
whom
he
cut
in
two
his
and
gave
her
half
at
the
last
day
of
school
she
goes
part
way
with
john
and
then
he
turns
and
goes
a
longer
distance
towards
her
home
so
that
it
is
late
when
he
reaches
his
own
is
he
late
he
did
know
he
was
late
he
came
straight
home
when
school
was
dismissed
only
going
a
little
way
home
with
alice
linton
to
help
her
carry
her
books
in
a
box
in
his
chamber
which
he
has
lately
put
a
padlock
on
among
fishhooks
and
lines
and
baitboxes
odd
pieces
of
brass
twine
early
sweet
apples
beechnuts
and
other
articles
of
value
are
some
little
fancifully
folded
or
otherwise
and
written
i
will
warrant
in
red
or
beautifully
blue
ink
these
little
notes
are
parting
gifts
at
the
close
of
school
and
john
no
doubt
gave
his
own
in
exchange
for
them
though
the
writing
was
an
immense
labor
and
the
folding
was
a
secret
bought
of
another
boy
for
a
big
piece
of
sweet
baked
in
sugar
a
delicacy
which
john
used
to
carry
in
his
until
his
pocket
was
in
such
a
state
that
putting
his
fingers
into
it
was
about
as
good
as
dipping
them
into
the
at
home
each
precious
note
contained
a
lock
or
curl
of
girl
hair
a
rare
collection
of
all
colors
after
john
had
been
in
school
many
terms
and
had
passed
through
a
great
many
parting
scenes
black
brown
red
and
some
that
looked
like
spun
gold
and
felt
like
silk
the
sentiment
contained
in
the
notes
was
that
which
was
common
in
the
school
and
expressed
a
melancholy
foreboding
of
early
death
and
a
touching
desire
to
leave
hair
enough
this
side
the
grave
to
constitute
a
sort
of
strand
of
remembrance
with
little
variation
the
poetry
that
made
the
hair
precious
was
in
the
words
and
as
a
cockney
would
say
set
to
the
hair
following
lock
of
hair
which
i
did
wear
was
taken
from
my
head
when
this
you
see
remember
me
long
after
i
am
john
liked
to
read
these
verses
which
always
made
a
new
and
fresh
impression
with
each
lock
of
hair
and
he
was
not
critical
they
were
for
him
vehicles
of
true
sentiment
and
indeed
they
were
what
he
used
when
he
inclosed
a
clip
of
his
own
sandy
hair
to
a
friend
and
it
did
not
occur
to
him
until
he
was
a
great
deal
older
and
less
innocent
to
smile
at
them
john
felt
that
he
would
sacredly
keep
every
lock
of
hair
intrusted
to
him
though
death
should
come
on
the
wings
of
cholera
and
take
away
every
one
of
these
sad
correspondents
when
big
brother
one
day
caught
sight
of
these
treasures
and
brutally
told
him
that
he
hair
enough
to
stuff
a
john
was
so
outraged
and
shocked
as
he
should
have
been
at
this
rude
invasion
of
his
heart
this
coarse
suggestion
this
profanation
of
his
most
delicate
feeling
that
he
was
kept
from
crying
only
by
the
resolution
to
his
brother
as
soon
as
ever
he
got
big
enough
viii
the
coming
of
thanksgiving
one
of
the
best
things
in
farming
is
gathering
the
chestnuts
butternuts
and
even
beechnuts
in
the
late
fall
after
the
frosts
have
cracked
the
husks
and
the
high
winds
have
shaken
them
and
the
colored
leaves
have
strewn
the
ground
on
a
bright
october
day
when
the
air
is
full
of
golden
sunshine
there
is
nothing
quite
so
exhilarating
as
going
nutting
nor
is
the
pleasure
of
it
altogether
destroyed
for
the
boy
by
the
consideration
that
he
is
making
himself
useful
in
obtaining
supplies
for
the
winter
household
the
of
potatoes
and
corn
is
a
different
thing
that
is
the
prose
but
nutting
is
the
poetry
of
farm
life
i
am
not
sure
but
the
boy
would
find
it
very
irksome
though
if
he
were
obliged
to
work
at
in
order
to
procure
food
for
the
family
he
is
willing
to
make
himself
useful
in
his
own
way
the
italian
boy
who
works
day
after
day
at
a
huge
pile
of
pounding
and
cracking
them
and
taking
out
the
long
seeds
which
are
sold
and
eaten
as
we
eat
nuts
and
which
are
almost
as
good
as
another
favorite
with
the
italians
probably
does
not
see
the
fun
of
nutting
indeed
if
the
here
were
set
at
pounding
off
the
and
opening
the
prickly
as
a
task
he
would
think
himself
an
boy
what
a
hardship
the
prickles
in
his
fingers
would
be
but
now
he
digs
them
out
with
his
and
enjoys
the
process
on
the
whole
the
boy
is
willing
to
do
any
amount
of
work
if
it
is
called
play
in
nutting
the
squirrel
is
not
more
nimble
and
industrious
than
the
boy
i
like
to
see
a
crowd
of
boys
swarm
over
a
they
leave
a
desert
behind
them
like
the
locusts
to
climb
a
tree
and
shake
it
to
club
it
to
strip
it
of
its
fruit
and
pass
to
the
next
is
the
sport
of
a
brief
time
i
have
seen
a
legion
of
boys
scamper
over
our
under
the
each
one
as
active
as
if
he
were
a
new
patent
sweeping
the
ground
clean
of
nuts
and
disappear
over
the
hill
before
i
could
go
to
the
door
and
speak
to
them
about
it
indeed
i
have
noticed
that
boys
do
care
much
for
conversation
with
the
owners
of
they
could
speedily
make
their
fortunes
if
they
would
work
as
rapidly
in
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
except
a
flock
of
turkeys
removing
the
grasshoppers
from
a
piece
of
pasture
perhaps
it
is
not
generally
known
that
we
get
the
idea
of
some
of
our
best
military
maneuvers
from
the
turkey
the
deploying
of
the
in
advance
of
an
army
is
one
of
them
the
of
our
holiday
militia
companies
is
copied
exactly
from
the
turkey
gobbler
he
has
the
same
splendid
appearance
the
same
proud
step
and
the
same
martial
aspect
the
gobbler
does
not
lead
his
forces
in
the
field
but
goes
behind
them
like
the
colonel
of
a
regiment
so
that
he
can
see
every
part
of
the
line
and
direct
its
movements
this
resemblance
is
one
of
the
most
singular
things
in
natural
history
i
like
to
watch
the
gobbler
maneuvering
his
forces
in
a
he
throws
out
his
company
of
two
dozen
turkeys
in
a
the
number
disposed
at
equal
distances
while
he
walks
majestically
in
the
rear
they
advance
rapidly
picking
right
and
left
with
military
precision
killing
the
foe
and
disposing
of
the
dead
bodies
with
the
same
peck
nobody
has
yet
discovered
how
many
grasshoppers
a
turkey
will
hold
but
he
is
very
much
like
a
boy
at
a
thanksgiving
dinner
he
keeps
on
eating
as
long
as
the
supplies
last
the
gobbler
in
one
of
these
raids
does
not
condescend
to
grab
a
single
grasshopper
at
least
not
while
anybody
is
watching
him
but
i
suppose
he
makes
up
for
it
when
his
dignity
can
not
be
injured
by
having
spectators
of
his
voracity
perhaps
he
falls
upon
the
grasshoppers
when
they
are
driven
into
a
corner
of
the
field
but
he
is
only
fattening
himself
for
destruction
like
all
greedy
persons
he
comes
to
a
bad
end
and
if
the
turkeys
had
any
they
would
be
taught
this
the
new
england
boy
used
to
look
forward
to
thanksgiving
as
the
great
event
of
the
year
he
was
apt
to
get
stents
set
him
so
much
corn
to
husk
for
instance
before
that
day
so
that
he
could
have
an
extra
and
in
order
to
gain
a
day
or
two
he
would
work
at
his
task
with
the
rapidity
of
half
a
dozen
boys
he
always
had
the
day
after
thanksgiving
as
a
holiday
and
this
was
the
day
he
counted
on
thanksgiving
itself
was
rather
an
awful
festival
very
much
like
sunday
except
for
the
enormous
dinner
which
filled
his
imagination
for
months
before
as
completely
as
it
did
his
stomach
for
that
day
and
a
week
after
there
was
an
impression
in
the
house
that
that
dinner
was
the
most
important
event
since
the
landing
from
the
mayflower
heliogabalus
who
did
not
resemble
a
pilgrim
father
at
all
but
who
had
prepared
for
himself
in
his
day
some
very
sumptuous
banquets
in
rome
and
ate
a
great
deal
of
the
best
he
could
get
and
liked
peacocks
stuffed
with
asafetida
for
one
thing
never
had
anything
like
a
thanksgiving
dinner
for
do
you
suppose
that
he
or
sardanapalus
either
ever
had
different
kinds
of
pie
at
one
dinner
therein
many
a
new
england
boy
is
greater
than
the
roman
emperor
or
the
assyrian
king
and
these
were
among
the
most
luxurious
eaters
of
their
day
and
generation
but
something
more
is
necessary
to
make
good
men
than
plenty
to
eat
as
heliogabalus
no
doubt
found
when
his
head
was
cut
off
cutting
off
the
head
was
a
mode
the
people
had
of
expressing
disapproval
of
their
conspicuous
men
nowadays
they
elect
them
to
a
higher
office
or
give
them
a
mission
to
some
foreign
country
if
they
do
not
do
well
where
they
are
for
days
and
days
before
thanksgiving
the
boy
was
kept
at
work
evenings
pounding
and
paring
and
cutting
up
and
mixing
not
being
allowed
to
taste
much
until
the
world
seemed
to
him
to
be
made
of
fragrant
spices
green
fruit
raisins
and
pastry
a
world
that
he
was
only
yet
allowed
to
enjoy
through
his
nose
how
filled
the
house
was
with
the
most
delicious
smells
the
that
were
made
if
john
had
been
shut
in
solid
walls
with
them
piled
about
him
he
could
have
eaten
his
way
out
in
four
weeks
there
were
dainties
enough
cooked
in
those
two
weeks
to
have
made
the
entire
year
luscious
with
good
living
if
they
had
been
scattered
along
in
it
but
people
were
probably
all
the
better
for
scrimping
themselves
a
little
in
order
to
make
this
a
great
feast
and
it
was
not
by
any
means
over
in
a
day
there
were
weeks
deep
of
and
other
pastry
the
cold
buttery
was
a
cave
of
aladdin
and
it
took
a
long
time
to
excavate
all
its
riches
thanksgiving
day
itself
was
a
heavy
dav
the
hilarity
of
it
being
so
subdued
by
going
to
meeting
and
the
universal
wearing
of
the
sunday
clothes
that
the
boy
could
see
it
but
if
he
felt
little
exhilaration
he
ate
a
great
deal
the
next
day
was
the
real
holiday
then
were
the
parties
and
perhaps
the
skatings
and
for
the
freezing
weather
came
before
the
proclamation
in
many
parts
of
new
england
the
night
after
thanksgiving
occurred
perhaps
the
first
real
party
that
the
boy
had
ever
attended
with
live
girls
in
it
dressed
so
bewitchingly
and
there
he
heard
those
philandering
songs
and
played
those
sweet
games
of
forfeits
which
put
him
quite
beside
himself
and
kept
him
awake
that
night
till
the
rooster
crowed
at
the
end
of
his
first
what
a
new
world
did
that
party
open
to
him
i
think
it
likely
that
he
saw
there
and
probably
did
not
dare
say
ten
words
to
some
tall
graceful
girl
much
older
than
himself
who
seemed
to
him
like
a
new
order
of
being
he
could
see
her
face
just
as
plainly
in
the
darkness
of
his
chamber
he
wondered
if
she
noticed
how
awkward
he
was
and
how
short
his
were
he
blushed
as
he
thought
of
his
rather
shoes
and
determined
then
and
there
that
he
would
be
put
off
with
a
ribbon
any
longer
but
would
have
a
young
man
necktie
it
was
somewhat
painful
thinking
the
party
over
but
it
was
delicious
too
he
did
not
think
probably
that
he
would
die
for
that
tall
handsome
girl
he
did
not
put
it
exactly
in
that
way
but
he
rather
resolved
to
live
for
her
which
might
in
the
end
amount
to
the
same
thing
at
least
he
thought
that
nobody
would
live
to
speak
twice
disrespectfully
of
her
in
his
presence
ix
the
season
of
what
john
said
was
that
he
did
care
much
for
but
that
was
after
he
had
eaten
a
whole
one
it
seemed
to
him
then
that
mince
would
be
better
the
feeling
of
a
boy
towards
has
never
been
properly
considered
there
is
an
air
of
festivity
about
its
approach
in
the
fall
the
boy
is
willing
to
help
pare
and
cut
up
the
pumpkin
and
he
watches
with
the
greatest
interest
the
process
and
the
pouring
into
the
scalloped
crust
when
the
sweet
savor
of
the
baking
reaches
his
nostrils
he
is
filled
with
the
most
delightful
anticipations
why
should
he
not
be
he
knows
that
for
months
to
come
the
buttery
will
contain
golden
treasures
and
that
it
will
require
only
a
slight
ingenuity
to
get
at
them
the
fact
is
that
the
boy
is
as
good
in
the
buttery
as
in
any
part
of
farming
his
elders
say
that
the
boy
is
always
hungry
but
that
is
a
very
coarse
way
to
put
it
he
has
only
recently
come
into
a
world
that
is
full
of
good
things
to
eat
and
there
is
on
the
whole
a
very
short
time
in
which
to
eat
them
at
least
he
is
told
among
the
first
information
he
receives
that
life
is
short
life
being
brief
and
pie
and
the
like
fleeting
he
very
soon
decides
upon
an
active
campaign
it
may
be
an
old
story
to
people
who
have
been
eating
for
forty
or
fifty
years
but
it
is
different
with
a
beginner
he
takes
the
thick
and
thin
as
it
comes
as
to
pie
for
instance
some
people
do
make
them
very
thin
i
knew
a
place
where
they
were
not
thicker
than
the
poor
plaster
they
were
spread
so
thin
upon
the
crust
that
they
were
better
fitted
to
draw
out
hunger
than
to
satisfy
it
they
used
to
be
made
up
by
the
great
and
kept
in
the
dry
cellar
where
they
hardened
and
dried
to
a
toughness
you
would
hardly
believe
this
was
a
long
time
ago
and
they
make
the
in
the
country
better
now
or
the
race
of
boys
would
have
been
so
discouraged
that
i
think
they
would
have
stopped
coming
into
the
world
the
truth
is
that
boys
have
always
been
so
plenty
that
they
are
not
half
appreciated
we
have
shown
that
a
farm
could
not
get
along
without
them
and
yet
their
rights
are
seldom
recognized
one
of
the
most
amusing
things
is
their
effort
to
acquire
personal
property
the
boy
has
the
care
of
the
calves
they
always
need
feeding
or
shutting
up
or
letting
out
when
the
boy
wants
to
play
there
are
those
calves
to
be
looked
after
until
he
gets
to
hate
the
name
of
calf
but
in
consideration
of
his
faithfulness
two
of
them
are
given
to
him
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
are
his
he
has
the
entire
charge
of
them
when
they
get
to
be
steers
he
spends
all
his
holidays
in
breaking
them
in
to
a
yoke
he
gets
them
so
broken
in
that
they
will
run
like
a
pair
of
deer
all
over
the
farm
turning
the
yoke
and
kicking
their
heels
while
he
follows
in
full
chase
shouting
the
ox
language
till
he
is
red
in
the
face
when
the
steers
grow
up
to
be
cattle
a
drover
one
day
comes
along
and
takes
them
away
and
the
boy
is
told
that
he
can
have
another
pair
of
calves
and
so
with
undiminished
faith
he
goes
back
and
begins
over
again
to
make
his
fortune
he
owns
lambs
and
young
colts
in
the
same
way
and
makes
just
as
much
out
of
them
there
are
ways
in
which
the
can
earn
money
as
by
gathering
the
early
chestnuts
and
taking
them
to
the
corner
store
or
by
finding
turkeys
eggs
and
selling
them
to
his
mother
and
another
way
is
to
go
without
butter
at
the
table
but
the
money
thus
made
is
for
the
heathen
john
read
in
livingstone
that
some
of
the
tribes
in
central
africa
which
is
represented
by
a
blank
spot
in
the
atlas
use
the
butter
to
grease
their
hair
putting
on
pounds
of
it
at
a
time
and
he
said
he
had
rather
eat
his
butter
than
have
it
put
to
that
use
especially
as
it
melted
away
so
fast
in
that
hot
climate
of
course
it
was
explained
to
john
that
the
missionaries
do
not
actually
carry
butter
to
africa
and
that
they
must
usually
go
without
it
themselves
there
it
being
almost
impossible
to
make
it
good
from
the
milk
in
the
cocoanuts
and
it
was
further
explained
to
him
that
even
if
the
heathen
never
received
his
butter
or
the
money
for
it
it
was
an
excellent
thing
for
a
boy
to
cultivate
the
habit
of
and
of
benevolence
and
if
the
heathen
never
heard
of
him
he
would
be
blessed
for
his
generosity
this
was
all
true
but
john
said
that
he
was
tired
of
supporting
the
heathen
out
of
his
butter
and
he
wished
the
rest
of
the
family
would
also
stop
eating
butter
and
save
the
money
for
missions
and
he
wanted
to
know
where
the
other
members
of
the
family
got
their
money
to
send
to
the
heathen
and
his
mother
said
that
he
was
about
half
right
and
that
was
just
as
good
for
grown
people
as
it
was
for
little
boys
and
girls
the
boy
is
not
always
slow
to
take
what
he
considers
his
rights
speaking
of
those
thin
kept
in
the
cellar
cupboard
i
used
to
know
a
boy
who
afterwards
grew
to
be
a
selectman
and
brushed
his
hair
straight
up
like
general
jackson
and
went
to
the
legislature
where
he
always
voted
against
every
measure
that
was
proposed
in
the
most
honest
manner
and
got
the
reputation
of
being
the
of
the
rats
in
the
cellar
were
nothing
to
be
compared
to
this
boy
for
destructiveness
in
pies
he
used
to
go
down
whenever
he
could
make
an
excuse
to
get
apples
for
the
family
or
draw
a
mug
of
cider
for
his
dear
old
grandfather
who
was
a
famous
about
the
revolutionary
war
and
would
no
doubt
have
been
wounded
in
battle
if
he
had
not
been
as
prudent
as
he
was
patriotic
and
come
upstairs
with
a
tallow
candle
in
one
hand
and
the
apples
or
cider
in
the
other
looking
as
innocent
and
as
unconscious
as
if
he
had
never
done
anything
in
his
life
except
deny
himself
butter
for
the
sake
of
the
heathen
and
yet
this
boy
would
have
buttoned
under
his
jacket
an
entire
round
and
the
pie
was
so
well
made
and
so
dry
that
it
was
not
injured
in
the
least
and
it
never
hurt
the
boy
clothes
a
bit
more
than
if
it
had
been
inside
of
him
instead
of
outside
and
this
boy
would
retire
to
a
secluded
place
and
eat
it
with
another
boy
being
never
suspected
because
he
was
not
in
the
cellar
long
enough
to
eat
a
pie
and
he
never
appeared
to
have
one
about
him
but
he
did
something
worse
than
this
when
his
mother
saw
that
pie
after
pie
departed
she
told
the
family
that
she
suspected
the
hired
man
and
the
boy
never
said
a
word
which
was
the
meanest
kind
of
lying
that
hired
man
was
probably
regarded
with
suspicion
by
the
family
to
the
end
of
his
days
and
if
he
had
been
accused
of
robbing
they
would
have
believed
him
guilty
i
should
wonder
if
that
selectman
occasionally
has
remorse
now
about
that
pie
dreams
perhaps
that
it
is
buttoned
up
under
his
jacket
and
sticking
to
him
like
a
breastplate
that
it
lies
upon
his
stomach
like
a
round
and
nightmare
eating
into
his
vitals
perhaps
not
it
is
difficult
to
say
exactly
what
was
the
sin
of
stealing
that
kind
of
pie
especially
if
the
one
who
stole
it
ate
it
it
could
have
been
used
for
the
game
of
pitching
quoits
and
a
pair
of
them
would
have
made
very
fair
wheels
for
the
and
yet
it
is
probably
as
wrong
to
steal
a
thin
pie
as
a
thick
one
and
it
made
no
difference
because
it
was
easy
to
steal
this
sort
easy
stealing
is
no
better
than
easy
lying
where
detection
of
the
lie
is
difficult
the
boy
who
steals
his
mother
pies
has
no
right
to
be
surprised
when
some
other
boy
steals
his
watermelons
stealing
is
like
charity
in
one
respect
it
is
apt
to
begin
at
home
x
first
experience
of
the
world
if
i
were
forced
to
be
a
boy
and
a
boy
in
the
country
the
best
kind
of
boy
to
be
in
the
summer
i
would
be
about
ten
years
of
age
as
soon
as
i
got
any
older
i
would
quit
it
the
trouble
with
a
boy
is
that
just
as
he
begins
to
enjoy
himself
he
is
too
old
and
has
to
be
set
to
doing
something
else
if
a
country
boy
were
wise
he
would
stay
at
just
that
age
when
he
could
enjoy
himself
most
and
have
the
least
expected
of
him
in
the
way
of
work
of
course
the
perfectly
good
boy
will
always
prefer
to
work
and
to
do
for
his
father
and
errands
for
his
mother
and
sisters
rather
than
enjoy
himself
in
his
own
way
i
never
saw
but
one
such
boy
he
lived
in
the
town
of
goshen
not
the
place
where
the
butter
is
made
but
a
much
better
goshen
than
that
and
i
never
saw
him
but
i
heard
of
him
and
being
about
the
same
age
as
i
supposed
i
was
taken
once
from
zoah
where
i
lived
to
goshen
to
see
him
but
he
was
dead
he
had
been
dead
almost
a
year
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
him
he
died
of
the
most
singular
disease
it
was
from
not
eating
green
apples
in
the
season
of
them
this
boy
whose
name
was
solomon
before
he
died
would
rather
split
up
for
his
mother
than
go
the
consequence
was
that
he
was
kept
at
splitting
and
such
work
most
of
the
time
and
grew
a
better
and
more
useful
boy
day
by
day
solomon
would
not
disobey
his
parents
and
eat
green
apples
not
even
when
they
were
ripe
enough
to
knock
off
with
a
stick
but
he
had
such
a
longing
for
them
that
he
pined
and
passed
away
if
he
had
eaten
the
green
apples
he
would
have
died
of
them
probably
so
that
his
example
is
a
difficult
one
to
follow
in
fact
a
boy
is
a
hard
subject
to
get
a
moral
from
all
his
little
playmates
who
ate
green
apples
came
to
solomon
funeral
and
were
very
sorry
for
what
they
had
done
john
was
a
very
different
boy
from
solomon
not
half
so
good
nor
half
so
dead
he
was
a
farmer
boy
as
solomon
was
but
he
did
not
take
so
much
interest
in
the
farm
if
john
could
have
had
his
way
he
would
have
discovered
a
cave
full
of
diamonds
and
lots
of
full
of
and
spanish
dollars
with
a
pretty
little
girl
living
in
the
cave
and
two
beautifully
caparisoned
horses
upon
which
taking
the
jewels
and
money
they
would
have
ridden
off
together
he
did
not
know
where
john
had
got
thus
far
in
his
studies
which
were
apparently
arithmetic
and
geography
but
were
in
reality
the
arabian
nights
and
other
books
of
high
and
mighty
adventure
he
was
a
simple
and
did
not
know
much
about
the
world
as
it
is
but
he
had
one
of
his
own
imagination
in
which
he
lived
a
good
deal
i
daresay
he
found
out
soon
enough
what
the
world
is
and
he
had
a
lesson
or
two
when
he
was
quite
young
in
two
incidents
which
i
may
as
well
relate
if
you
had
seen
john
at
this
time
you
might
have
thought
he
was
only
a
shabbily
dressed
country
lad
and
you
never
would
have
guessed
what
beautiful
thoughts
he
sometimes
had
as
he
went
stubbing
his
toes
along
the
dusty
road
nor
what
a
chivalrous
little
fellow
he
was
you
would
have
seen
a
short
boy
barefooted
with
trousers
at
once
too
big
and
too
short
held
up
perhaps
by
one
suspender
only
a
checked
cotton
shirt
and
a
hat
of
braided
frayed
at
the
edges
and
bulged
up
in
the
crown
it
is
impossible
to
keep
a
hat
neat
if
you
use
it
to
catch
bumblebees
and
whisk
to
bail
the
water
from
a
leaky
boat
to
catch
minnows
in
to
put
over
nests
and
to
transport
pebbles
strawberries
and
hens
eggs
john
usually
carried
a
sling
in
his
hand
or
a
bow
or
a
limber
stick
sharp
at
one
end
from
which
he
could
sling
apples
a
great
distance
if
he
walked
in
the
road
he
walked
in
the
middle
of
it
shuffling
up
the
dust
or
if
he
went
elsewhere
he
was
likely
to
be
running
on
the
top
of
the
fence
or
the
stone
wall
and
chasing
chipmunks
john
knew
the
best
place
to
dig
in
all
the
farm
it
was
in
a
meadow
by
the
river
where
the
bobolinks
sang
so
gayly
he
never
liked
to
hear
the
bobolink
sing
however
for
he
said
it
always
reminded
him
of
the
whetting
of
a
scythe
and
that
reminded
him
of
spreading
hay
and
if
there
was
anything
he
hated
it
was
spreading
hay
after
the
mowers
guess
you
would
like
it
yourself
said
john
the
stubbs
getting
into
your
feet
and
the
hot
sun
and
the
men
getting
ahead
of
you
all
you
could
towards
evening
once
john
was
coming
along
the
road
home
with
some
stalks
of
the
in
his
hand
there
is
a
succulent
pith
in
the
end
of
the
stalk
which
is
very
good
to
eat
tender
and
not
so
strong
as
the
root
and
john
liked
to
pull
it
and
carry
home
what
he
did
not
eat
on
the
way
as
he
was
walking
along
he
met
a
carriage
which
stopped
opposite
to
him
he
also
stopped
and
bowed
as
country
boys
used
to
bow
in
john
day
a
lady
leaned
from
the
carriage
and
said
have
you
got
little
boy
she
seemed
to
be
the
most
beautiful
woman
john
had
ever
seen
with
light
hair
dark
tender
eyes
and
the
sweetest
smile
there
was
that
in
her
gracious
mien
and
in
her
dress
which
reminded
john
of
the
beautiful
castle
ladies
with
whom
he
was
well
acquainted
in
books
he
felt
that
he
knew
her
at
once
and
he
also
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
young
prince
himself
i
fancy
he
did
look
much
like
one
but
of
his
own
appearance
he
thought
not
at
all
as
he
replied
to
the
lady
question
without
the
least
embarrassment
stalk
would
you
like
some
i
should
like
to
taste
it
said
the
lady
with
a
most
winning
smile
used
to
be
very
fond
of
it
when
i
was
a
little
john
was
delighted
that
the
lady
should
like
and
that
she
was
pleased
to
accept
it
from
him
he
thought
himself
that
it
was
about
the
best
thing
to
eat
he
knew
he
handed
up
a
large
bunch
of
it
the
lady
took
two
or
three
stalks
and
was
about
to
return
the
rest
when
john
said
keep
it
all
i
can
get
lots
know
where
it
ever
so
you
thank
you
said
the
lady
and
as
the
carriage
started
she
reached
out
her
hand
to
john
he
did
not
understand
the
motion
until
he
saw
a
cent
drop
in
the
road
at
his
feet
instantly
all
his
illusion
and
his
pleasure
vanished
something
like
tears
were
in
his
eyes
as
he
shouted
do
want
your
cent
i
do
sell
flag
john
was
intensely
mortified
suppose
he
said
thought
i
was
a
sort
of
to
think
of
selling
flag
at
any
rate
he
walked
away
and
left
the
cent
in
the
road
a
humiliated
boy
the
next
day
he
told
jim
gates
about
it
jim
said
he
was
green
not
to
take
the
money
he
go
and
look
for
it
now
if
he
would
tell
him
about
where
it
dropped
and
jim
did
spend
an
hour
poking
about
in
the
dirt
but
he
did
not
find
the
cent
jim
however
had
an
idea
he
said
he
was
going
to
dig
and
see
if
another
carriage
come
along
john
next
rebuff
and
knowledge
of
the
world
was
of
another
sort
he
was
again
walking
the
road
at
twilight
when
he
was
overtaken
by
a
wagon
with
one
seat
upon
which
were
two
pretty
girls
and
a
young
gentleman
sat
between
them
driving
it
was
a
merry
party
and
john
could
hear
them
laughing
and
singing
as
they
approached
him
the
wagon
stopped
when
it
overtook
him
and
one
of
the
girls
leaned
from
the
seat
and
said
quite
seriously
and
pleasantly
boy
how
your
mar
john
was
surprised
and
puzzled
for
a
moment
he
had
never
seen
the
young
lady
but
he
thought
that
she
perhaps
knew
his
mother
at
any
rate
his
instinct
of
politeness
made
him
say
pretty
well
i
thank
she
know
you
are
out
and
thereupon
all
three
in
the
wagon
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
and
dashed
on
it
flashed
upon
john
in
a
moment
that
he
had
been
imposed
on
and
it
hurt
him
dreadfully
his
was
injured
somehow
and
he
felt
as
if
his
lovely
gentle
mother
had
been
insulted
he
would
like
to
have
thrown
a
stone
at
the
wagon
and
in
a
rage
he
cried
a
nice
but
he
could
think
of
any
hard
bitter
words
quick
enough
probably
the
young
lady
who
might
have
been
almost
any
young
lady
never
knew
what
a
cruel
thing
she
had
done
xi
home
inventions
the
winter
season
is
not
all
sliding
downhill
for
the
by
any
means
yet
he
contrives
to
get
as
much
fun
out
of
it
as
from
any
part
of
the
year
there
is
a
difference
in
boys
some
are
always
jolly
and
some
go
scowling
always
through
life
as
if
they
had
a
on
each
heel
i
like
a
jolly
boy
i
used
to
know
one
who
came
round
every
morning
to
sell
molasses
candy
offering
two
sticks
for
a
cent
apiece
it
was
worth
fifty
cents
a
day
to
see
his
cheery
face
that
boy
rose
in
the
world
he
is
now
the
owner
of
a
large
town
at
the
west
to
be
sure
there
are
no
houses
in
it
except
his
own
but
there
is
a
map
of
it
and
roads
and
streets
are
laid
out
on
it
with
dwellings
and
churches
and
academies
and
a
college
and
an
and
you
could
scarcely
tell
it
from
springfield
or
hartford
on
paper
he
and
all
his
family
have
the
fever
and
ague
and
shake
worse
than
the
people
at
lebanon
but
they
do
not
mind
it
it
makes
them
lively
in
fact
ed
may
is
just
as
jolly
as
he
used
to
be
he
calls
his
town
mayopolis
and
expects
to
be
mayor
of
it
his
wife
however
calls
the
town
maybe
the
likes
to
have
winter
come
for
one
thing
because
it
freezes
up
the
ground
so
that
he
ca
dig
in
it
and
it
is
covered
with
snow
so
that
there
is
no
picking
up
stones
nor
driving
the
cows
to
pasture
he
would
have
a
very
easy
time
if
it
were
not
for
the
getting
up
before
daylight
to
build
the
fires
and
do
the
nature
intended
the
long
winter
nights
for
the
to
sleep
but
in
my
day
he
was
expected
to
open
his
sleepy
eyes
when
the
cock
crew
get
out
of
the
warm
bed
and
light
a
candle
struggle
into
his
cold
pantaloons
and
pull
on
boots
in
which
the
thermometer
would
have
gone
down
to
zero
rake
open
the
coals
on
the
hearth
and
start
the
morning
fire
and
then
go
to
the
barn
to
the
frost
was
thick
on
the
kitchen
windows
the
snow
was
drifted
against
the
door
and
the
journey
to
the
barn
in
the
pale
light
of
dawn
over
the
creaking
snow
was
like
an
exile
trip
to
siberia
the
boy
was
not
half
awake
when
he
stumbled
into
the
cold
barn
and
was
greeted
by
the
lowing
and
bleating
and
neighing
of
cattle
waiting
for
their
breakfast
how
their
breath
steamed
up
from
the
mangers
and
hung
in
frosty
spears
from
their
noses
through
the
great
lofts
above
the
hay
where
the
swallows
nested
the
winter
wind
whistled
and
the
snow
sifted
those
old
barns
were
well
ventilated
i
used
to
spend
much
valuable
time
in
planning
a
barn
that
should
be
tight
and
warm
with
a
fire
in
it
if
necessary
in
order
to
keep
the
temperature
somewhere
near
the
i
could
see
how
the
cattle
could
live
in
a
place
where
a
lively
boy
full
of
young
blood
would
freeze
to
death
in
a
short
time
if
he
did
not
swing
his
arms
and
slap
his
hands
and
jump
about
like
a
goat
i
thought
i
would
have
a
sort
of
perpetual
manger
that
should
shake
down
the
hay
when
it
was
wanted
and
a
machine
that
should
cut
up
the
turnips
and
pass
them
into
the
mangers
and
water
always
flowing
for
the
cattle
and
horses
to
drink
with
these
simple
arrangements
i
could
lie
in
bed
and
know
that
the
were
doing
themselves
it
would
also
be
necessary
in
order
that
i
should
not
be
disturbed
that
the
crow
should
be
taken
out
of
the
roosters
but
i
could
think
of
no
process
to
do
it
it
seems
to
me
that
the
if
they
know
as
much
as
they
say
they
do
might
raise
a
breed
of
crowless
roosters
for
the
benefit
of
boys
quiet
neighborhoods
and
sleepy
families
there
was
another
notion
that
i
had
about
kindling
the
kitchen
fire
that
i
never
carried
out
it
was
to
have
a
spring
at
the
head
of
my
bed
connecting
with
a
wire
which
should
run
to
a
torpedo
which
i
would
plant
over
night
in
the
ashes
of
the
fireplace
by
touching
the
spring
i
could
explode
the
torpedo
which
would
scatter
the
ashes
and
cover
the
live
coals
and
at
the
same
time
shake
down
the
sticks
of
wood
which
were
standing
by
the
side
of
the
ashes
in
the
chimney
and
the
fire
would
kindle
itself
this
ingenious
plan
was
frowned
on
by
the
whole
family
who
said
they
did
not
want
to
be
waked
up
every
morning
by
an
explosion
and
yet
they
expected
me
to
wake
up
without
an
explosion
a
boy
plans
for
making
life
agreeable
are
hardly
ever
heeded
i
never
knew
a
boy
farmer
who
was
not
eager
to
go
to
the
district
school
in
the
winter
there
is
such
a
chance
for
learning
that
he
must
be
a
dull
boy
who
does
not
come
out
in
the
spring
a
fair
skater
an
accurate
and
an
accomplished
with
or
without
a
board
on
his
seat
on
his
stomach
or
on
his
feet
take
a
moderate
hill
with
a
down
it
worn
to
icy
smoothness
and
a
of
boys
on
it
and
there
is
nothing
like
it
for
whittling
away
the
boy
is
the
shoemaker
friend
an
active
lad
can
wear
down
a
pair
of
cowhide
soles
in
a
week
so
that
the
ice
will
scrape
his
toes
sledding
or
coasting
is
also
slow
fun
compared
to
the
sliding
down
a
steep
hill
over
a
hard
glistening
crust
it
is
not
only
dangerous
but
it
is
destructive
to
jacket
and
pantaloons
to
a
degree
to
make
a
tailor
laugh
if
any
other
animal
wore
out
his
skin
as
fast
as
a
schoolboy
wears
out
his
clothes
in
winter
it
would
need
a
new
one
once
a
month
in
a
country
patches
were
not
by
any
means
a
sign
of
poverty
but
of
the
boy
courage
and
adventurous
disposition
our
elders
used
to
threaten
to
dress
us
in
leather
and
put
seats
in
our
trousers
the
boy
said
that
he
wore
out
his
trousers
on
the
hard
seats
in
the
schoolhouse
ciphering
hard
sums
for
that
extraordinary
statement
he
received
two
castigations
one
at
home
that
was
mild
and
one
from
the
schoolmaster
who
was
careful
to
lay
the
rod
upon
the
boy
punishing
him
as
he
jocosely
called
it
on
a
sliding
scale
according
to
the
thinness
of
his
pantaloons
what
i
liked
best
at
school
however
was
the
study
of
history
early
history
the
indian
wars
we
studied
it
mostly
at
noontime
and
we
had
it
illustrated
as
the
children
nowadays
have
though
our
object
was
not
so
much
to
have
lessons
as
it
was
to
revive
real
history
back
of
the
schoolhouse
rose
a
round
hill
upon
which
tradition
said
had
stood
in
colonial
times
a
built
by
the
settlers
for
defense
against
the
indians
for
the
indians
had
the
idea
that
the
whites
were
not
settled
enough
and
used
to
come
nights
to
settle
them
with
a
tomahawk
it
was
called
fort
hill
it
was
very
steep
on
each
side
and
the
river
ran
close
by
it
was
a
charming
place
in
summer
where
one
could
find
laurel
and
checkerberries
and
sassafras
roots
and
sit
in
the
cool
breeze
looking
at
the
mountains
across
the
river
and
listening
to
the
murmur
of
the
deerfield
the
methodists
built
a
there
afterwards
but
the
hill
was
so
slippery
in
winter
that
the
aged
could
not
climb
it
and
the
wind
raged
so
fiercely
that
it
blew
nearly
all
the
young
methodists
away
many
of
whom
were
afterwards
heard
of
in
the
west
and
finally
the
itself
came
down
into
the
valley
and
grew
a
steeple
and
enjoyed
itself
ever
afterwards
it
used
to
be
a
notion
in
new
england
that
a
ought
to
stand
as
near
heaven
as
possible
the
boys
at
our
school
divided
themselves
into
two
parties
one
was
the
early
settlers
and
the
other
the
pequots
the
latter
the
most
numerous
the
early
settlers
built
a
snow
fort
on
the
hill
and
a
strong
fortress
it
was
constructed
of
snowballs
rolled
up
to
a
vast
size
larger
than
the
cyclopean
blocks
of
stone
which
form
the
ancient
etruscan
walls
in
italy
piled
one
upon
another
and
the
whole
cemented
by
pouring
on
water
which
froze
and
made
the
walls
solid
the
pequots
helped
the
whites
build
it
it
had
a
covered
way
under
the
snow
through
which
only
could
it
be
entered
and
it
had
bastions
and
towers
and
openings
to
fire
from
and
a
great
many
other
things
for
which
there
are
no
names
in
military
books
and
it
had
a
glacis
and
a
ditch
outside
when
it
was
completed
the
early
settlers
leaving
the
women
in
the
schoolhouse
a
prey
to
the
indians
used
to
retire
into
it
and
await
the
attack
of
the
pequots
there
was
only
a
handful
of
the
garrison
while
the
indians
were
many
and
also
barbarous
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
be
barbarous
and
it
was
in
this
light
that
the
great
question
was
settled
whether
a
boy
might
snowball
with
balls
that
he
had
soaked
over
night
in
water
and
let
freeze
they
were
as
hard
as
and
if
a
boy
should
be
hit
in
the
head
by
one
of
them
he
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
a
pequot
or
an
early
settler
it
was
considered
as
unfair
to
use
these
in
open
fight
as
it
is
to
use
poisoned
ammunition
in
real
war
but
as
the
whites
were
protected
by
the
fort
and
the
indians
were
treacherous
by
nature
it
was
decided
that
the
latter
might
use
the
hard
missiles
the
pequots
used
to
come
swarming
up
the
hill
with
hideous
attacking
the
fort
on
all
sides
with
great
noise
and
a
shower
of
balls
the
garrison
replied
with
yells
of
defiance
and
shots
hurling
back
the
invaders
when
they
attempted
to
scale
the
walls
the
settlers
had
the
advantage
of
position
but
they
were
sometimes
overpowered
by
numbers
and
would
often
have
had
to
surrender
but
for
the
ringing
of
the
the
pequots
were
in
great
fear
of
the
i
do
not
remember
that
the
whites
ever
hauled
down
their
flag
and
surrendered
voluntarily
but
once
or
twice
the
fort
was
carried
by
storm
and
the
garrison
were
massacred
to
a
boy
and
thrown
out
of
the
fortress
having
been
first
scalped
to
take
a
boy
cap
was
to
scalp
him
and
after
that
he
was
dead
if
he
played
fair
there
were
a
great
many
hard
hits
given
and
taken
but
always
cheerfully
for
it
was
in
the
cause
of
our
early
history
the
history
of
greece
and
rome
was
stuff
compared
to
this
and
we
had
many
boys
in
our
school
who
could
imitate
the
indian
war
whoop
enough
better
than
they
could
scan
arma
virumque
cano
xii
the
lonely
farmhouse
the
winter
evenings
of
the
in
new
england
used
not
to
be
so
gay
as
to
tire
him
of
the
pleasures
of
life
before
he
became
of
age
a
remote
farmhouse
standing
a
little
off
the
road
banked
up
with
sawdust
and
earth
to
keep
the
frost
out
of
the
cellar
blockaded
with
snow
and
flying
a
blue
flag
of
smoke
from
its
chimney
looks
like
a
besieged
fort
on
cold
and
stormy
winter
nights
to
the
traveler
wearily
dragging
along
in
his
creaking
sleigh
the
light
from
its
windows
suggests
a
house
of
refuge
and
the
cheer
of
a
blazing
fire
but
it
is
no
less
a
fort
into
which
the
family
retire
when
the
new
england
winter
on
the
hills
really
sets
in
the
boy
is
an
important
part
of
the
garrison
he
is
not
only
one
of
the
best
means
of
communicating
with
the
outer
world
but
he
furnishes
half
the
entertainment
and
takes
two
thirds
of
the
scolding
of
the
family
circle
a
farm
would
come
to
grief
without
a
it
but
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
a
farmhouse
without
a
boy
in
it
brings
life
into
the
house
his
tracks
are
to
be
seen
everywhere
he
leaves
all
the
doors
open
he
has
half
filled
the
he
makes
noise
enough
to
wake
the
dead
or
he
is
in
a
by
the
fire
and
can
not
be
stirred
or
he
has
fastened
a
grip
into
some
crusoe
book
which
can
not
easily
be
shaken
off
i
suppose
that
the
evenings
are
not
now
what
they
used
to
be
that
he
has
more
books
and
less
to
do
and
is
not
half
so
good
a
boy
as
formerly
when
he
used
to
think
the
almanac
was
pretty
lively
reading
and
the
comic
almanac
if
he
could
get
hold
of
that
was
a
supreme
delight
of
course
he
had
the
evenings
to
himself
after
he
had
done
the
at
the
barn
brought
in
the
wood
and
piled
it
high
in
the
box
ready
to
be
heaped
upon
the
great
open
fire
it
was
nearly
dark
when
he
came
from
school
with
its
continuation
of
snowballing
and
sliding
and
he
always
had
an
agreeable
time
stumbling
and
fumbling
around
in
barn
and
in
the
waning
light
john
used
to
say
that
he
supposed
nobody
would
do
his
if
he
did
not
get
home
till
midnight
and
he
was
never
contradicted
whatever
happened
to
him
and
whatever
length
of
days
or
sort
of
weather
was
produced
by
the
almanac
the
cardinal
rule
was
that
he
should
be
at
home
before
dark
john
used
to
imagine
what
people
did
in
the
dark
ages
and
wonder
sometimes
whether
he
was
still
in
them
of
course
john
had
nothing
to
do
all
the
evening
after
his
except
little
things
while
he
drew
his
chair
up
to
the
table
in
order
to
get
the
full
radiance
of
the
tallow
candle
on
his
slate
or
his
book
the
women
of
the
house
also
sat
by
the
table
knitting
and
sewing
the
head
of
the
house
sat
in
his
chair
tipped
back
against
the
chimney
the
hired
man
was
in
danger
of
burning
his
boots
in
the
fire
john
might
be
deep
in
the
excitement
of
a
bear
story
or
be
hard
at
writing
a
on
his
greasy
slate
but
whatever
he
was
doing
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
always
be
interrupted
it
was
he
who
must
snuff
the
candles
and
put
on
a
stick
of
wood
and
toast
the
cheese
and
turn
the
apples
and
crack
the
nuts
he
knew
where
the
board
was
and
he
could
find
the
considering
that
he
was
expected
to
go
to
bed
at
eight
one
would
say
that
the
opportunity
for
study
was
not
great
and
that
his
reading
was
rather
interrupted
there
seemed
to
be
always
something
for
him
to
do
even
when
all
the
rest
of
the
family
came
as
near
being
idle
as
is
ever
possible
in
a
new
england
household
no
wonder
that
john
was
not
sleepy
at
eight
he
had
been
flying
about
while
the
others
had
been
yawning
before
the
fire
he
would
like
to
sit
up
just
to
see
how
much
more
solemn
and
stupid
it
would
become
as
the
night
went
on
he
wanted
to
tinker
his
skates
to
mend
his
sled
to
finish
that
chapter
why
should
he
go
away
from
that
bright
blaze
and
the
company
that
sat
in
its
radiance
to
the
cold
and
solitude
of
his
chamber
why
did
the
people
who
were
sleepy
go
to
bed
how
lonesome
the
old
house
was
how
cold
it
was
away
from
that
great
central
fire
in
the
heart
of
it
how
its
timbers
creaked
as
if
in
the
contracting
pinch
of
the
frost
what
a
rattling
there
was
of
windows
what
a
concerted
attack
upon
the
clapboards
how
the
floors
squeaked
and
what
gusts
from
round
corners
came
to
snatch
the
feeble
flame
of
the
candle
from
the
boy
hand
how
he
shivered
as
he
paused
at
the
staircase
window
to
look
out
upon
the
great
fields
of
snow
upon
the
stripped
forest
through
which
he
could
hear
the
wind
raving
in
a
kind
of
fury
and
up
at
the
black
flying
clouds
amid
which
the
young
moon
was
dashing
and
driven
on
like
a
frail
shallop
at
sea
and
his
teeth
chattered
more
than
ever
when
he
got
into
the
icy
sheets
and
drew
himself
up
into
a
ball
in
his
flannel
nightgown
like
a
fox
in
his
hole
for
a
little
time
he
could
hear
the
noises
downstairs
and
an
occasional
laugh
he
could
guess
that
now
they
were
having
cider
and
now
apples
were
going
round
and
he
could
feel
the
wind
tugging
at
the
house
even
sometimes
shaking
the
bed
but
this
did
not
last
long
he
soon
went
away
into
a
country
he
always
delighted
to
be
in
a
calm
place
where
the
wind
never
blew
and
no
one
dictated
the
time
of
going
to
bed
to
any
one
else
i
like
to
think
of
him
sleeping
there
in
such
rude
surroundings
ingenious
innocent
mischievous
with
no
thought
of
the
buffeting
he
is
to
get
from
a
world
that
has
a
good
many
worse
places
for
a
boy
than
the
hearth
of
an
old
farmhouse
and
the
sweet
though
undemonstrative
affection
of
its
family
life
but
there
were
other
evenings
in
the
boy
life
that
were
different
from
these
at
home
and
one
of
them
he
will
never
forget
it
opened
a
new
world
to
john
and
set
him
into
a
great
flutter
it
produced
a
revolution
in
his
mind
in
regard
to
neckties
it
made
him
wonder
if
greased
boots
were
quite
the
thing
compared
with
blacked
boots
and
he
wished
he
had
a
long
so
that
he
could
see
as
he
walked
away
from
it
what
was
the
effect
of
round
patches
on
the
portion
of
his
trousers
he
could
not
see
except
in
a
mirror
and
if
patches
were
quite
stylish
even
on
everyday
trousers
and
he
began
to
be
very
much
troubled
about
the
parting
of
his
hair
and
how
to
find
out
on
which
side
was
the
natural
part
the
evening
to
which
i
refer
was
that
of
john
first
party
he
knew
the
girls
at
school
and
he
was
interested
in
some
of
them
with
a
different
interest
from
that
he
took
in
the
boys
he
never
wanted
to
it
with
one
of
them
for
an
insult
in
a
fight
and
he
instinctively
softened
a
boy
natural
rudeness
when
he
was
with
them
he
would
help
a
timid
little
girl
to
stand
erect
and
slide
he
would
draw
her
on
his
sled
till
his
hands
were
stiff
with
cold
without
a
murmur
he
would
generously
give
her
red
apples
into
which
he
longed
to
set
his
own
sharp
teeth
and
he
would
cut
in
two
his
for
a
girl
when
he
would
not
for
a
boy
had
he
not
some
of
the
beautiful
auburn
tresses
of
cynthia
rudd
in
his
skate
and
wintergreen
box
at
home
and
yet
the
grand
sentiment
of
life
was
little
awakened
in
john
he
liked
best
to
be
with
boys
and
their
rough
play
suited
him
better
than
the
amusements
of
the
shrinking
fluttering
timid
and
sensitive
little
girls
john
had
not
learned
then
that
a
is
stronger
than
a
cable
or
that
a
pretty
little
girl
could
turn
him
round
her
finger
a
great
deal
easier
than
a
big
bully
of
a
boy
could
make
him
cry
john
had
indeed
been
at
and
had
accomplished
the
feat
of
home
with
a
afterwards
and
he
had
been
growing
into
the
habit
of
looking
around
in
meeting
on
sunday
and
noticing
how
cynthia
was
dressed
and
not
enjoying
the
service
quite
as
much
if
cynthia
was
absent
as
when
she
was
present
but
there
was
very
little
sentiment
in
all
this
and
nothing
whatever
to
make
john
blush
at
hearing
her
name
but
now
john
was
invited
to
a
regular
party
there
was
the
invitation
in
a
billet
sealed
with
a
transparent
wafer
rudd
requests
the
pleasure
of
the
company
of
all
in
blue
ink
and
the
finest
kind
of
writing
what
a
precious
document
it
was
to
john
it
even
exhaled
a
faint
sort
of
perfume
whether
of
lavender
or
he
could
not
tell
he
read
it
over
a
hundred
times
and
showed
it
confidentially
to
his
favorite
cousin
who
had
beaux
of
her
own
and
had
even
with
them
in
the
parlor
and
from
this
sympathetic
cousin
john
got
advice
as
to
what
he
should
wear
and
how
he
should
conduct
himself
at
the
party
xiii
john
first
party
it
turned
out
that
john
did
not
go
after
all
to
cynthia
rudd
party
having
broken
through
the
ice
on
the
river
when
he
was
skating
that
day
and
as
the
boy
who
pulled
him
out
said
within
an
inch
of
his
but
he
took
care
not
to
tumble
into
anything
that
should
keep
him
from
the
next
party
which
was
given
with
due
formality
by
melinda
mayhew
john
had
been
many
a
time
to
the
house
of
deacon
mayhew
and
never
with
any
hesitation
even
if
he
knew
that
both
the
daughters
melinda
and
sophronia
were
at
home
the
only
fear
he
had
felt
was
of
the
deacon
big
dog
who
always
surlily
watched
him
as
he
came
up
the
walk
and
made
a
rush
at
him
if
he
showed
the
least
sign
of
wavering
but
upon
the
night
of
the
party
his
courage
vanished
and
he
thought
he
would
rather
face
all
the
dogs
in
town
than
knock
at
the
front
door
the
parlor
was
lighted
up
and
as
john
stood
on
the
broad
flagging
before
the
front
door
by
the
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
voices
girls
voices
which
set
his
heart
in
a
flutter
he
could
face
the
whole
district
school
of
girls
without
flinching
he
did
mind
in
the
in
their
sunday
best
but
he
began
to
be
conscious
that
now
he
was
passing
to
a
new
sphere
where
the
girls
are
supreme
and
superior
and
he
began
to
feel
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
an
awkward
boy
the
girl
takes
to
society
as
naturally
as
a
duckling
does
to
the
placid
pond
but
with
a
semblance
of
shy
timidity
the
boy
plunges
in
with
a
great
splash
and
hides
his
shy
awkwardness
in
noise
and
commotion
when
john
entered
the
company
had
nearly
all
come
he
knew
them
every
one
and
yet
there
was
something
about
them
strange
and
unfamiliar
they
were
all
a
little
afraid
of
each
other
as
people
are
apt
to
be
when
they
are
well
dressed
and
met
together
for
social
purposes
in
the
country
to
be
at
a
real
party
was
a
novel
thing
for
most
of
them
and
put
a
constraint
upon
them
which
they
could
not
at
once
overcome
perhaps
it
was
because
they
were
in
the
awful
parlor
that
carpeted
room
of
haircloth
furniture
which
was
so
seldom
opened
upon
the
wall
hung
two
certificates
framed
in
black
one
certifying
that
by
the
payment
of
fifty
dollars
deacon
mayhew
was
a
life
member
of
the
american
tract
society
and
the
other
that
by
a
like
outlay
of
bread
cast
upon
the
waters
his
wife
was
a
life
member
of
the
a
a
portion
of
the
alphabet
which
has
an
awful
significance
to
all
new
england
childhood
these
certificates
are
a
sort
of
receipt
in
full
for
charity
and
are
a
constant
and
consoling
reminder
to
the
farmer
that
he
has
discharged
his
religious
duties
there
was
a
fire
on
the
broad
hearth
and
that
with
the
tallow
candles
on
the
mantelpiece
made
quite
an
illumination
in
the
room
and
enabled
the
boys
who
were
mostly
on
one
side
of
the
room
to
see
the
girls
who
were
on
the
other
quite
plainly
how
sweet
and
demure
the
girls
looked
to
be
sure
every
boy
was
thinking
if
his
hair
was
slick
and
feeling
the
full
embarrassment
of
his
entrance
into
fashionable
life
it
was
queer
that
these
children
who
were
so
free
everywhere
else
should
be
so
constrained
now
and
not
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
the
shooting
of
a
spark
out
upon
the
carpet
was
a
great
relief
and
was
accompanied
by
a
deal
of
scrambling
to
throw
it
back
into
the
fire
and
caused
much
giggling
it
was
only
gradually
that
the
formality
was
at
all
broken
and
the
young
people
got
together
and
found
their
tongues
john
at
length
found
himself
with
cynthia
rudd
to
his
great
delight
and
considerable
embarrassment
for
cynthia
who
was
older
than
john
never
looked
so
pretty
to
his
surprise
he
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
they
had
always
found
plenty
to
talk
about
before
but
now
nothing
that
he
could
think
of
seemed
worth
saying
at
a
party
is
a
pleasant
evening
said
john
is
quite
so
replied
cynthia
you
come
in
a
cutter
asked
john
anxiously
i
walked
on
the
crust
and
it
was
perfectly
lovely
walking
said
cynthia
in
a
burst
of
confidence
it
slippery
continued
john
john
hoped
it
would
be
slippery
very
when
he
walked
home
with
cynthia
as
he
determined
to
do
but
he
did
not
dare
to
say
so
and
the
conversation
ran
aground
again
john
thought
about
his
dog
and
his
sled
and
his
yoke
of
steers
but
he
did
see
any
way
to
bring
them
into
conversation
had
she
read
the
family
only
a
little
ways
john
said
it
was
splendid
and
he
would
lend
it
to
her
for
which
she
thanked
him
and
said
with
such
a
sweet
expression
she
should
be
so
glad
to
have
it
from
him
that
was
encouraging
and
then
john
asked
cynthia
if
she
had
seen
sally
hawkes
since
the
husking
at
their
house
when
sally
found
so
many
red
ears
and
she
think
she
was
a
real
pretty
girl
she
was
right
pretty
and
cynthia
guessed
that
sally
knew
it
pretty
well
but
did
john
like
the
color
of
her
eyes
no
john
did
like
the
color
of
her
eyes
exactly
mouth
would
be
well
enough
if
she
did
laugh
so
much
and
show
her
john
said
her
mouth
was
her
worst
feature
no
said
cynthia
warmly
mouth
is
better
than
her
john
did
know
but
it
was
better
than
her
nose
and
he
should
like
her
looks
better
if
her
hair
was
so
dreadful
black
but
cynthia
who
could
afford
to
be
generous
now
said
she
liked
black
hair
and
she
wished
hers
was
dark
whereupon
john
protested
that
he
liked
light
hair
auburn
hair
of
all
things
and
cynthia
said
that
sally
was
a
dear
good
girl
and
she
did
believe
one
word
of
the
story
that
she
only
really
found
one
red
ear
at
the
husking
that
night
and
hid
that
and
kept
pulling
it
out
as
if
it
were
a
new
one
and
so
the
conversation
once
started
went
on
as
briskly
as
possible
about
the
and
the
and
the
new
who
was
coming
and
how
jack
thompson
had
gone
to
northampton
to
be
a
clerk
in
a
store
and
how
elvira
reddington
in
the
geography
class
at
school
was
asked
what
was
the
capital
of
massachusetts
and
had
answered
and
all
the
school
laughed
john
enjoyed
the
conversation
amazingly
and
he
half
wished
that
he
and
cynthia
were
the
whole
of
the
party
but
the
party
had
meantime
got
into
operation
and
the
formality
was
broken
up
when
the
boys
and
girls
had
ventured
out
of
the
parlor
into
the
more
comfortable
with
its
and
everyday
things
and
even
gone
so
far
as
to
penetrate
the
kitchen
in
their
frolic
as
soon
as
they
forgot
they
were
a
party
they
began
to
enjoy
themselves
but
the
real
pleasure
only
began
with
the
games
the
party
was
nothing
without
the
games
and
indeed
it
was
made
for
the
games
very
likely
it
was
one
of
the
timid
girls
who
proposed
to
play
something
and
when
the
ice
was
once
broken
the
whole
company
went
into
the
business
enthusiastically
there
was
no
dancing
we
should
hope
not
not
in
the
deacon
house
not
with
the
deacon
daughters
nor
anywhere
in
this
good
puritanic
society
dancing
was
a
sin
in
itself
and
no
one
could
tell
what
it
would
lead
to
but
there
was
no
reason
why
the
boys
and
girls
should
come
together
and
kiss
each
other
during
a
whole
evening
occasionally
kissing
was
a
sign
of
peace
and
was
not
at
all
like
taking
hold
of
hands
and
skipping
about
to
the
scraping
of
a
wicked
fiddle
in
the
games
there
was
a
great
deal
of
clasping
hands
of
going
round
in
a
circle
of
passing
under
each
other
elevated
arms
of
singing
about
my
true
love
and
the
end
was
kisses
distributed
with
more
or
less
partiality
according
to
the
rules
of
the
play
but
thank
heaven
there
was
no
fiddler
john
liked
it
all
and
was
quite
brave
about
paying
all
the
forfeits
imposed
on
him
even
to
the
kissing
all
the
girls
in
the
room
but
he
thought
he
could
have
amended
that
by
kissing
a
few
of
them
a
good
many
times
instead
of
kissing
them
all
once
but
john
was
destined
to
have
a
damper
put
upon
his
enjoyment
they
were
playing
a
most
fascinating
game
in
which
they
all
stand
in
a
circle
and
sing
a
philandering
song
except
one
who
is
in
the
center
of
the
ring
and
holds
a
cushion
at
a
certain
word
in
the
song
the
one
in
the
center
throws
the
cushion
at
the
feet
of
some
one
in
the
ring
indicating
thereby
the
choice
of
a
and
then
the
two
sweetly
kneel
upon
the
cushion
like
two
meek
angels
and
and
so
forth
then
the
chosen
one
takes
the
cushion
and
the
delightful
play
goes
on
it
is
very
easy
as
it
will
be
seen
to
learn
how
to
play
it
cynthia
was
holding
the
cushion
and
at
the
fatal
word
she
threw
it
down
not
before
john
but
in
front
of
ephraim
leggett
and
they
two
kneeled
and
so
forth
john
was
astounded
he
had
never
conceived
of
such
perfidy
in
the
female
heart
he
felt
like
wiping
ephraim
off
the
face
of
the
earth
only
ephraim
was
older
and
bigger
than
he
when
it
came
his
turn
at
length
thanks
to
a
plain
little
girl
for
whose
admiration
he
did
care
a
straw
he
threw
the
cushion
down
before
melinda
mayhew
with
all
the
devotion
he
could
muster
and
a
dagger
look
at
cynthia
and
cynthia
perfidious
smile
only
enraged
him
the
more
john
felt
wronged
and
worked
himself
up
to
pass
a
wretched
evening
when
supper
came
he
never
went
near
cynthia
and
busied
himself
in
carrying
different
kinds
of
pie
and
cake
and
red
apples
and
cider
to
the
girls
he
liked
the
least
he
shunned
cynthia
and
when
he
was
accidentally
near
her
and
she
asked
him
if
he
would
get
her
a
glass
of
cider
he
rudely
told
her
like
a
goose
as
he
was
that
she
had
better
ask
ephraim
that
seemed
to
him
very
smart
but
he
got
more
and
more
miserable
and
began
to
feel
that
he
was
making
himself
ridiculous
girls
have
a
great
deal
more
good
sense
in
such
matters
than
boys
cynthia
went
to
john
at
length
and
asked
him
simply
what
the
matter
was
john
blushed
and
said
that
nothing
was
the
matter
cynthia
said
that
it
would
do
for
two
people
always
to
be
together
at
a
party
and
so
they
made
up
and
john
obtained
permission
to
cynthia
home
it
was
after
nine
when
the
great
festivities
at
the
broke
up
and
john
walked
home
with
cynthia
over
the
shining
crust
and
under
the
stars
it
was
mostly
a
silent
walk
for
this
was
also
an
occasion
when
it
is
difficult
to
find
anything
fit
to
say
and
john
was
thinking
all
the
way
how
he
should
bid
cynthia
whether
it
would
do
and
whether
it
would
do
this
not
being
a
game
and
no
forfeits
attaching
to
it
when
they
reached
the
gate
there
was
an
awkward
little
pause
john
said
the
stars
were
uncommonly
bright
cynthia
did
not
deny
it
but
waited
a
minute
and
then
turned
abruptly
away
with
john
cynthia
and
the
party
was
over
and
cynthia
was
gone
and
john
went
home
in
a
kind
of
dissatisfaction
with
himself
it
was
long
before
he
could
go
to
sleep
for
thinking
of
the
new
world
opened
to
him
and
imagining
how
he
would
act
under
a
hundred
different
circumstances
and
what
he
would
say
and
what
cynthia
would
say
but
a
dream
at
length
came
and
led
him
away
to
a
great
city
and
a
brilliant
house
and
while
he
was
there
he
heard
a
loud
rapping
on
the
under
floor
and
saw
that
it
was
daylight
xiv
the
sugar
camp
i
think
there
is
no
part
of
farming
the
boy
enjoys
more
than
the
making
of
maple
sugar
it
is
better
than
and
nearly
as
good
as
fishing
and
one
reason
he
likes
this
work
is
that
somebody
else
does
the
most
of
it
it
is
a
sort
of
work
in
which
he
can
appear
to
be
very
active
and
yet
not
do
much
and
it
exactly
suits
the
temperament
of
a
real
boy
to
be
very
busy
about
nothing
if
the
power
for
instance
that
is
expended
in
play
by
a
boy
between
the
ages
of
eight
and
fourteen
could
be
applied
to
some
industry
we
should
see
wonderful
results
but
a
boy
is
like
a
galvanic
battery
that
is
not
in
connection
with
anything
he
generates
electricity
and
plays
it
off
into
the
air
with
the
most
reckless
prodigality
and
i
for
one
would
have
it
otherwise
it
is
as
much
a
boy
business
to
play
off
his
energies
into
space
as
it
is
for
a
flower
to
blow
or
a
catbird
to
sing
snatches
of
the
tunes
of
all
the
other
birds
in
my
day
used
to
be
something
between
picnicking
and
being
shipwrecked
on
a
fertile
island
where
one
should
save
from
the
wreck
tubs
and
augers
and
great
kettles
and
pork
and
hen
eggs
and
bread
and
begin
at
once
to
lead
the
sweetest
life
in
the
world
i
am
told
that
it
is
something
different
nowadays
and
that
there
is
more
desire
to
save
the
sap
and
make
good
pure
sugar
and
sell
it
for
a
large
price
than
there
used
to
be
and
that
the
old
fun
and
picturesqueness
of
the
business
are
pretty
much
gone
i
am
told
that
it
is
the
custom
to
carefully
collect
the
sap
and
bring
it
to
the
house
where
there
are
built
brick
arches
over
which
it
is
evaporated
in
shallow
pans
and
that
pains
is
taken
to
keep
the
leaves
sticks
and
ashes
and
coals
out
of
it
and
that
the
sugar
is
clarified
and
that
in
short
it
is
a
business
in
which
there
is
very
little
fun
and
that
the
boy
is
not
allowed
to
dip
his
paddle
into
the
kettle
of
boiling
sugar
and
lick
off
the
delicious
sirup
the
prohibition
may
improve
the
sugar
but
it
is
cruel
to
the
boy
as
i
remember
the
new
england
boy
and
i
am
very
intimate
with
one
he
used
to
be
on
the
qui
vive
in
the
spring
for
the
sap
to
begin
running
i
think
he
discovered
it
as
soon
as
anybody
perhaps
he
knew
it
by
a
feeling
of
something
starting
in
his
own
veins
a
sort
of
spring
stir
in
his
legs
and
arms
which
tempted
him
to
stand
on
his
head
or
throw
a
handspring
if
he
could
find
a
spot
of
ground
from
which
the
snow
had
melted
the
sap
stirs
early
in
the
legs
of
a
and
shows
itself
in
uneasiness
in
the
toes
which
get
tired
of
boots
and
want
to
come
out
and
touch
the
soil
just
as
soon
as
the
sun
has
warmed
it
a
little
the
goes
barefoot
just
as
naturally
as
the
trees
burst
their
buds
which
were
packed
and
varnished
over
in
the
fall
to
keep
the
water
and
the
frost
out
perhaps
the
boy
has
been
out
digging
into
the
with
his
at
any
rate
he
is
pretty
sure
to
announce
the
discovery
as
he
comes
running
into
the
house
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
as
if
he
had
heard
a
hen
cackle
in
the
barn
with
runnin
and
then
indeed
the
stir
and
excitement
begin
the
which
have
been
stored
in
the
garret
over
the
and
which
the
boy
has
occasionally
climbed
up
to
look
at
with
another
boy
for
they
are
full
of
sweet
suggestions
of
the
annual
spring
frolic
the
are
brought
down
and
set
out
on
the
south
side
of
the
house
and
scalded
the
snow
is
still
a
foot
or
two
deep
in
the
woods
and
the
is
got
out
to
make
a
road
to
the
sugar
camp
and
the
campaign
begins
the
boy
is
everywhere
present
superintending
everything
asking
questions
and
filled
with
a
desire
to
help
the
excitement
it
is
a
great
day
when
the
cart
is
loaded
with
the
buckets
and
the
procession
starts
into
the
woods
the
sun
shines
almost
unobstructedly
into
the
forest
for
there
are
only
naked
branches
to
bar
it
the
snow
is
soft
and
beginning
to
sink
down
leaving
the
young
bushes
spindling
up
everywhere
the
snowbirds
are
twittering
about
and
the
noise
of
shouting
and
of
the
blows
of
the
axe
echoes
far
and
wide
this
is
spring
and
the
boy
can
scarcely
contain
his
delight
that
his
life
is
about
to
begin
again
in
the
first
place
the
men
go
about
and
tap
the
trees
drive
in
the
spouts
and
hang
the
buckets
under
the
boy
watches
all
these
operations
with
the
greatest
interest
he
wishes
that
sometime
when
a
hole
is
bored
in
a
tree
the
sap
would
spout
out
in
a
stream
as
it
does
when
a
is
tapped
but
it
never
does
it
only
drops
sometimes
almost
in
a
stream
but
on
the
whole
slowly
and
the
boy
learns
that
the
sweet
things
of
the
world
have
to
be
patiently
waited
for
and
do
not
usually
come
otherwise
than
drop
by
drop
then
the
camp
is
to
be
cleared
of
snow
the
shanty
is
with
boughs
in
front
of
it
two
enormous
logs
are
rolled
nearly
together
and
a
fire
is
built
between
them
forked
sticks
are
set
at
each
end
and
a
long
pole
is
laid
on
them
and
on
this
are
hung
the
great
caldron
kettles
the
huge
hogsheads
are
turned
right
side
up
and
cleaned
out
to
receive
the
sap
that
is
gathered
and
now
if
there
is
a
good
run
the
establishment
is
under
full
headway
the
great
fire
that
is
kindled
up
is
never
let
out
night
or
day
as
long
as
the
season
lasts
somebody
is
always
cutting
wood
to
feed
it
somebody
is
busy
most
of
the
time
gathering
in
the
sap
somebody
is
required
to
watch
the
kettles
that
they
do
not
boil
over
and
to
fill
them
it
is
not
the
boy
however
he
is
too
busy
with
things
in
general
to
be
of
any
use
in
details
he
has
his
own
little
and
small
pails
with
which
he
gathers
the
sweet
liquid
he
has
a
little
of
his
own
with
small
logs
and
a
tiny
kettle
in
the
great
kettles
the
boiling
goes
on
slowly
and
the
liquid
as
it
thickens
is
dipped
from
one
to
another
until
in
the
end
kettle
it
is
reduced
to
sirup
and
is
taken
out
to
cool
and
settle
until
enough
is
made
to
to
is
to
boil
the
sirup
until
it
is
thick
enough
to
crystallize
into
sugar
this
is
the
grand
event
and
is
done
only
once
in
two
or
three
days
but
the
boy
desire
is
to
perpetually
he
boils
his
kettle
down
as
rapidly
as
possible
he
is
not
particular
about
chips
scum
or
ashes
he
is
apt
to
burn
his
sugar
but
if
he
can
get
enough
to
make
a
little
wax
on
the
snow
or
to
scrape
from
the
bottom
of
the
kettle
with
his
wooden
paddle
he
is
happy
a
good
deal
is
wasted
on
his
hands
and
the
outside
of
his
face
and
on
his
clothes
but
he
does
not
care
he
is
not
stingy
to
watch
the
operations
of
the
big
fire
gives
him
constant
pleasure
sometimes
he
is
left
to
watch
the
boiling
kettles
with
a
piece
of
pork
tied
on
the
end
of
a
stick
which
he
dips
into
the
boiling
mass
when
it
threatens
to
go
over
he
is
constantly
tasting
of
it
however
to
see
if
it
is
not
almost
sirup
he
has
a
long
round
stick
whittled
smooth
at
one
end
which
he
uses
for
this
purpose
at
the
constant
risk
of
burning
his
tongue
the
smoke
blows
in
his
face
he
is
grimy
with
ashes
he
is
altogether
such
a
mass
of
dirt
stickiness
and
sweetness
that
his
own
mother
would
know
him
he
likes
to
boil
eggs
in
the
hot
sap
with
the
hired
man
he
likes
to
roast
potatoes
in
the
ashes
and
he
would
live
in
the
camp
day
and
night
if
he
were
permitted
some
of
the
hired
men
sleep
in
the
bough
shanty
and
keep
the
fire
blazing
all
night
to
sleep
there
with
them
and
awake
in
the
night
and
hear
the
wind
in
the
trees
and
see
the
sparks
fly
up
to
the
sky
is
a
perfect
realization
of
all
the
stories
of
adventures
he
has
ever
read
he
tells
the
other
boys
afterwards
that
he
heard
something
in
the
night
that
sounded
very
much
like
a
bear
the
hired
man
says
that
he
was
very
much
scared
by
the
hooting
of
an
owl
the
great
occasions
for
the
boy
though
are
the
times
of
sometimes
this
used
to
be
done
in
the
evening
and
it
was
made
the
excuse
for
a
frolic
in
the
camp
the
neighbors
were
invited
sometimes
even
the
pretty
girls
from
the
village
who
filled
all
the
woods
with
their
sweet
voices
and
merry
laughter
and
little
affectations
of
fright
the
white
snow
still
lies
on
all
the
ground
except
the
warm
spot
about
the
camp
the
tree
branches
all
show
distinctly
in
the
light
of
the
fire
which
sends
its
ruddy
glare
far
into
the
darkness
and
lights
up
the
bough
shanty
the
hogsheads
the
buckets
on
the
trees
and
the
group
about
the
boiling
kettles
until
the
scene
is
like
something
taken
out
of
a
fairy
play
if
rembrandt
could
have
seen
a
sugar
party
in
a
new
england
wood
he
would
have
made
out
of
its
strong
contrasts
of
light
and
shade
one
of
the
finest
pictures
in
the
world
but
rembrandt
was
not
born
in
massachusetts
people
hardly
ever
do
know
where
to
be
born
until
it
is
too
late
being
born
in
the
right
place
is
a
thing
that
has
been
very
much
neglected
at
these
sugar
parties
every
one
was
expected
to
eat
as
much
sugar
as
possible
and
those
who
are
practiced
in
it
can
eat
a
great
deal
it
is
a
peculiarity
about
eating
warm
maple
sugar
that
though
you
may
eat
so
much
of
it
one
day
as
to
be
sick
and
loathe
the
thought
of
it
you
will
want
it
the
next
day
more
than
ever
at
the
they
used
to
pour
the
hot
sugar
upon
the
snow
where
it
congealed
without
crystallizing
into
a
sort
of
wax
which
i
do
suppose
is
the
most
delicious
substance
that
was
ever
invented
and
it
takes
a
great
while
to
eat
it
if
one
should
close
his
teeth
firmly
on
a
ball
of
it
he
would
be
unable
to
open
his
mouth
until
it
dissolved
the
sensation
while
it
is
melting
is
very
pleasant
but
one
can
not
converse
the
boy
used
to
make
a
big
lump
of
it
and
give
it
to
the
dog
who
seized
it
with
great
avidity
and
closed
his
jaws
on
it
as
dogs
will
on
anything
it
was
funny
the
next
moment
to
see
the
expression
of
perfect
surprise
on
the
dog
face
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
open
his
jaws
he
shook
his
head
he
sat
down
in
despair
he
ran
round
in
a
circle
he
dashed
into
the
woods
and
back
again
he
did
everything
except
climb
a
tree
and
howl
it
would
have
been
such
a
relief
to
him
if
he
could
have
howled
but
that
was
the
one
thing
he
could
not
do
xv
the
heart
of
new
england
it
is
a
wonder
that
every
new
england
boy
does
not
turn
out
a
poet
or
a
missionary
or
a
peddler
most
of
them
used
to
there
is
everything
in
the
heart
of
the
new
england
hills
to
feed
the
imagination
of
the
boy
and
excite
his
longing
for
strange
countries
i
scarcely
know
what
the
subtle
influence
is
that
forms
him
and
attracts
him
in
the
most
fascinating
and
aromatic
of
all
lands
and
yet
urges
him
away
from
all
the
sweet
delights
of
his
home
to
become
a
roamer
in
literature
and
in
the
world
a
poet
and
a
wanderer
there
is
something
in
the
soil
and
the
pure
air
i
suspect
that
promises
more
romance
than
is
forthcoming
that
excites
the
imagination
without
satisfying
it
and
begets
the
desire
of
adventure
and
the
prosaic
life
of
the
sweet
home
does
not
at
all
correspond
to
the
boy
dreams
of
the
world
in
the
good
old
days
i
am
told
the
boys
on
the
coast
ran
away
and
became
sailors
the
countryboys
waited
till
they
grew
big
enough
to
be
missionaries
and
then
they
sailed
away
and
met
the
coast
boys
in
foreign
ports
john
used
to
spend
hours
in
the
top
of
a
slender
that
a
little
detached
itself
from
the
forest
which
crowned
the
brow
of
the
steep
and
lofty
pasture
behind
his
house
he
was
sent
to
make
war
on
the
bushes
that
constantly
encroached
upon
the
pastureland
but
john
had
no
hostility
to
any
growing
thing
and
a
very
little
bushwhacking
satisfied
him
when
he
had
grubbed
up
a
few
laurels
and
young
he
was
wont
to
retire
into
his
favorite
post
of
observation
and
meditation
perhaps
he
fancied
that
the
stem
to
which
he
clung
was
the
mast
of
a
ship
that
the
tossing
forest
behind
him
was
the
heaving
waves
of
the
sea
and
that
the
wind
which
moaned
over
the
woods
and
murmured
in
the
leaves
and
now
and
then
sent
him
a
wide
circuit
in
the
air
as
if
he
had
been
a
blackbird
on
the
of
a
spruce
was
an
ocean
gale
what
life
and
action
and
heroism
there
was
to
him
in
the
multitudinous
roar
of
the
forest
and
what
an
eternity
of
existence
in
the
monologue
of
the
river
which
brawled
far
far
below
him
over
its
wide
stony
bed
how
the
river
sparkled
and
danced
and
went
on
now
in
a
smooth
amber
current
now
fretted
by
the
pebbles
but
always
with
that
continuous
busy
song
john
never
knew
that
noise
to
cease
and
he
doubted
not
if
he
stayed
here
a
thousand
years
that
same
loud
murmur
would
fill
the
air
on
it
went
under
the
wide
spans
of
the
old
wooden
covered
bridge
swirling
around
the
great
rocks
on
which
the
piers
stood
spreading
away
below
in
shallows
and
taking
the
shadows
of
a
row
of
maples
that
lined
the
green
shore
save
this
roar
no
sound
reached
him
except
now
and
then
the
rumble
of
a
wagon
on
the
bridge
or
the
muffled
voices
of
some
chance
passers
on
the
road
seen
from
this
high
perch
the
familiar
village
sending
its
brown
roofs
and
white
spires
up
through
the
green
foliage
had
a
strange
aspect
and
was
like
some
town
in
a
book
say
a
village
nestled
in
the
swiss
mountains
or
something
in
bohemia
and
there
beyond
the
purple
hills
of
bozrah
and
not
so
far
as
the
stony
pastures
of
zoah
whither
john
had
helped
drive
the
colts
and
young
stock
in
the
spring
might
be
perhaps
jerusalem
itself
john
had
himself
once
been
to
the
land
of
canaan
with
his
grandfather
when
he
was
a
very
small
boy
and
he
had
once
seen
an
actual
jew
a
mysterious
person
with
uncut
beard
and
long
hair
who
sold
in
that
region
and
about
whom
there
was
a
rumor
that
he
was
once
caught
and
shaved
by
the
indignant
farmers
who
apprehended
in
his
long
locks
a
contempt
of
the
christian
religion
oh
the
world
had
vast
possibilities
for
john
away
to
the
south
up
a
vast
basin
of
forest
there
was
a
notch
in
the
horizon
and
an
opening
in
the
line
of
woods
where
the
road
ran
through
this
opening
john
imagined
an
army
might
appear
perhaps
british
perhaps
turks
and
banners
of
red
and
of
yellow
advance
and
a
cannon
wheel
about
and
point
its
long
nose
and
open
on
the
valley
he
fancied
the
army
after
this
salute
winding
down
the
mountain
road
deploying
in
the
meadows
and
giving
the
valley
to
pillage
and
to
flame
in
which
event
his
position
would
be
an
excellent
one
for
observation
and
for
safety
while
he
was
in
the
height
of
this
engagement
perhaps
the
horn
would
be
blown
from
the
back
porch
reminding
him
that
it
was
time
to
quit
cutting
brush
and
go
for
the
cows
as
if
there
were
no
better
use
for
a
warrior
and
a
poet
in
new
england
than
to
send
him
for
the
cows
john
knew
a
boy
a
bad
enough
boy
i
daresay
who
afterwards
became
a
general
in
the
war
and
went
to
congress
and
got
to
be
a
real
governor
who
also
used
to
be
sent
to
cut
brush
in
the
back
pastures
and
hated
it
in
his
very
soul
and
by
his
wrong
conduct
forecast
what
kind
of
a
man
he
would
be
this
boy
as
soon
as
he
had
cut
about
one
brush
would
seek
for
one
of
several
holes
in
the
ground
and
he
was
familiar
with
several
in
which
lived
a
animal
that
must
always
be
nameless
in
a
book
but
an
animal
quite
capable
of
the
most
pungent
defense
of
himself
this
young
aspirant
to
congress
would
cut
a
long
stick
with
a
little
crotch
in
the
end
of
it
and
run
it
into
the
hole
and
when
the
crotch
was
punched
into
the
fur
and
skin
of
the
animal
he
would
twist
the
stick
round
till
it
got
a
good
grip
on
the
skin
and
then
he
would
pull
the
beast
out
and
when
he
got
the
just
out
of
the
hole
so
that
his
dog
could
seize
him
the
boy
would
take
to
his
heels
and
leave
the
two
to
fight
it
out
content
to
scent
the
battle
afar
off
and
this
boy
who
was
in
training
for
public
life
would
do
this
sort
of
thing
all
the
afternoon
and
when
the
sun
told
him
that
he
had
spent
long
enough
time
cutting
brush
he
would
industriously
go
home
as
innocent
as
anybody
there
are
few
such
boys
as
this
nowadays
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
new
england
pastures
are
so
much
overgrown
with
brush
john
himself
preferred
to
hunt
the
pugnacious
woodchuck
he
bore
a
special
grudge
against
this
beyond
the
usual
hostility
that
boys
feel
for
any
wild
animal
one
day
on
his
way
to
school
a
woodchuck
crossed
the
road
before
him
and
john
gave
chase
the
woodchuck
scrambled
into
an
orchard
and
climbed
a
small
john
thought
this
a
most
cowardly
and
unfair
retreat
and
stood
under
the
tree
and
taunted
the
animal
and
stoned
it
thereupon
the
woodchuck
dropped
down
on
john
and
seized
him
by
the
leg
of
his
trousers
john
was
both
enraged
and
scared
by
this
dastardly
attack
the
teeth
of
the
enemy
went
through
the
cloth
and
met
and
there
he
hung
john
then
made
a
pivot
of
one
leg
and
whirled
himself
around
swinging
the
woodchuck
in
the
air
until
he
shook
him
off
but
in
his
departure
the
woodchuck
carried
away
a
large
piece
of
john
summer
the
boy
never
forgot
it
and
whenever
he
had
a
holiday
he
used
to
expend
an
amount
of
labor
and
ingenuity
in
the
pursuit
of
woodchucks
that
would
have
made
his
for
tune
in
any
useful
pursuit
there
was
a
hill
pasture
down
on
one
side
of
which
ran
a
small
brook
and
this
pasture
was
full
of
it
required
the
assistance
of
several
boys
to
capture
a
woodchuck
it
was
first
necessary
by
patient
watching
to
ascertain
that
the
woodchuck
was
at
home
when
one
was
seen
to
enter
his
burrow
then
all
the
entries
to
it
except
one
there
are
usually
three
were
plugged
up
with
stones
a
boy
and
a
dog
were
then
left
to
watch
the
open
hole
while
john
and
his
comrades
went
to
the
brook
and
began
to
dig
a
canal
to
turn
the
water
into
the
residence
of
the
woodchuck
this
was
often
a
difficult
feat
of
engineering
and
a
long
job
often
it
took
more
than
half
a
day
of
hard
labor
with
shovel
and
hoe
to
dig
the
canal
but
when
the
canal
was
finished
and
the
water
began
to
pour
into
the
hole
the
excitement
began
how
long
would
it
take
to
fill
the
hole
and
drown
out
the
woodchuck
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
the
hole
was
a
bottomless
pit
but
sooner
or
later
the
water
would
rise
in
it
and
then
there
was
sure
to
be
seen
the
nose
of
the
woodchuck
keeping
itself
on
a
level
with
the
rising
flood
it
was
piteous
to
see
the
anxious
look
of
the
hunted
creature
as
it
came
to
the
surface
and
caught
sight
of
the
dog
there
the
dog
stood
at
the
mouth
of
the
hole
quivering
with
excitement
from
his
nose
to
the
tip
of
his
tail
and
behind
him
were
the
cruel
boys
dancing
with
joy
and
setting
the
dog
on
the
poor
creature
would
disappear
in
the
water
in
terror
but
he
must
breathe
and
out
would
come
his
nose
again
nearer
the
dog
each
time
at
last
the
water
ran
out
of
the
hole
as
well
as
in
and
the
soaked
beast
came
with
it
and
made
a
desperate
rush
but
in
a
trice
the
dog
had
him
and
the
boys
stood
off
in
a
circle
with
stones
in
their
hands
to
see
what
they
called
they
maintained
perfect
so
long
as
the
dog
was
getting
the
best
of
the
woodchuck
but
if
the
latter
was
likely
to
escape
they
in
the
interest
of
peace
and
the
of
power
and
killed
the
woodchuck
this
is
a
boy
notion
of
justice
of
course
he
no
business
to
be
a
woodchuck
an
unspeakable
woodchuck
i
used
the
word
in
relation
to
the
new
england
soil
john
knew
very
well
all
its
sweet
aromatic
pungent
and
medicinal
products
and
liked
to
search
for
the
scented
herbs
and
the
wild
fruits
and
exquisite
flowers
but
he
did
not
then
know
and
few
do
know
that
there
is
no
part
of
the
globe
where
the
subtle
chemistry
of
the
earth
produces
more
that
is
agreeable
to
the
senses
than
a
new
england
and
the
green
meadow
at
its
foot
the
poets
have
succeeded
in
turning
our
attention
from
it
to
the
comparatively
barren
orient
as
the
land
of
spices
and
odorous
gums
and
it
is
indeed
a
constant
surprise
that
this
poor
and
stony
soil
elaborates
and
grows
so
many
delicate
and
aromatic
products
john
it
is
true
did
not
care
much
for
anything
that
did
not
appeal
to
his
taste
and
smell
and
delight
in
brilliant
color
and
he
trod
down
the
exquisite
ferns
and
the
wonderful
mosses
without
compunction
but
he
gathered
from
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
the
columbine
and
the
eglantine
and
the
blue
harebell
he
picked
the
alpine
strawberry
the
blueberry
the
boxberry
wild
currants
and
gooseberries
and
he
brought
home
armfuls
of
the
laurel
and
the
wild
honeysuckle
he
dug
the
roots
of
the
fragrant
sassafras
and
of
the
he
ate
the
tender
leaves
of
the
wintergreen
and
its
red
berries
he
gathered
the
peppermint
and
the
spearmint
he
gnawed
the
twigs
of
the
black
birch
there
was
a
stout
fern
which
he
called
which
he
pulled
up
and
found
that
the
soft
end
good
he
dug
the
amber
gum
from
the
and
liked
to
smell
though
he
could
not
chew
the
gum
of
the
wild
cherry
it
was
his
melancholy
duty
to
bring
home
such
medicinal
herbs
for
the
garret
as
the
the
tansy
and
the
loathsome
and
he
laid
in
for
the
winter
like
a
squirrel
stores
of
beechnuts
chestnuts
and
butternuts
but
that
which
lives
most
vividly
in
his
memory
and
most
strongly
draws
him
back
to
the
new
england
hills
is
the
aromatic
he
likes
to
eat
its
spicy
seeds
and
to
crush
in
his
hands
its
fragrant
leaves
their
odor
is
the
unique
essence
of
new
england
xvi
john
revival
the
new
england
of
the
last
generation
never
heard
of
christmas
there
was
no
such
day
in
his
calendar
if
john
ever
came
across
it
in
his
reading
he
attached
no
meaning
to
the
word
if
his
curiosity
had
been
aroused
and
he
had
asked
his
elders
about
it
he
might
have
got
the
dim
impression
that
it
was
a
kind
of
popish
holiday
the
celebration
of
which
was
about
as
wicked
as
or
being
a
john
knew
a
couple
of
desperately
bad
boys
who
were
reported
to
play
in
a
barn
on
the
haymow
and
the
enormity
of
this
practice
made
him
shudder
he
had
once
seen
a
pack
of
greasy
and
it
seemed
to
him
to
contain
the
quintessence
of
sin
if
he
had
desired
to
defy
all
divine
law
and
outrage
all
human
society
he
felt
that
he
could
do
it
by
shuffling
them
and
he
was
quite
right
the
two
bad
boys
enjoyed
in
stealth
their
scandalous
pastime
because
they
knew
it
was
the
most
wicked
thing
they
could
do
if
it
had
been
as
sinless
as
playing
marbles
they
would
have
cared
for
it
john
sometimes
drove
past
a
brown
farmhouse
whose
shiftless
inhabitants
it
was
said
were
people
and
it
is
impossible
to
describe
how
wicked
that
house
appeared
to
john
he
almost
expected
to
see
its
shingles
stand
on
end
in
the
old
new
england
one
could
not
in
any
other
way
so
express
his
contempt
of
all
holy
and
orderly
life
as
by
playing
cards
for
amusement
there
was
no
element
of
christmas
in
john
life
any
more
than
there
was
of
easter
and
probably
nobody
about
him
could
have
explained
easter
and
he
escaped
all
the
demoralization
attending
christmas
gifts
indeed
he
never
had
any
presents
of
any
kind
either
on
his
birthday
or
any
other
day
he
expected
nothing
that
he
did
not
earn
or
make
in
the
way
of
with
another
boy
he
was
taught
to
work
for
what
he
received
he
even
earned
as
i
said
the
extra
holidays
of
the
day
after
the
fourth
and
the
day
after
thanksgiving
of
the
free
grace
and
gifts
of
christmas
he
had
no
conception
the
single
and
melancholy
association
he
had
with
it
was
the
quaking
hymn
which
his
grandfather
used
to
sing
in
a
cracked
and
quavering
voice
shepherds
watched
their
flocks
by
night
all
seated
on
the
the
that
at
the
end
of
it
the
doleful
voice
always
repeating
glory
shone
around
made
john
as
miserable
as
from
the
it
was
all
one
dreary
expectation
of
something
uncomfortable
it
was
in
short
you
got
to
have
it
some
time
that
john
believed
but
it
lay
in
his
unthinking
mind
to
put
off
the
from
the
enjoyment
as
long
as
possible
he
experienced
a
kind
of
delightful
wickedness
in
indulging
his
dislike
of
hymns
and
of
sunday
john
was
not
a
model
boy
but
i
can
not
exactly
define
in
what
his
wickedness
consisted
he
had
no
inclination
to
steal
nor
much
to
lie
and
he
despised
and
stinginess
and
had
a
chivalrous
feeling
toward
little
girls
probably
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
any
virtue
in
not
stealing
and
lying
for
honesty
and
veracity
were
in
the
atmosphere
about
him
he
hated
work
and
he
easily
but
he
did
work
and
he
was
always
ashamed
when
he
was
over
his
fit
of
passion
in
short
you
could
find
a
much
better
wicked
boy
than
john
when
the
came
therefore
one
summer
john
was
in
a
quandary
sunday
meeting
and
he
did
mind
they
were
a
part
of
regular
life
and
only
temporarily
interrupted
a
boy
pleasures
but
when
there
began
to
be
evening
meetings
at
the
different
houses
a
new
element
came
into
affairs
there
was
a
kind
of
solemnity
over
the
community
and
a
seriousness
in
all
faces
at
first
these
twilight
assemblies
offered
a
little
relief
to
the
monotony
of
farm
life
and
john
liked
to
meet
the
boys
and
girls
and
to
watch
the
older
people
coming
in
dressed
in
their
second
best
i
think
john
imagination
was
worked
upon
by
the
sweet
and
mournful
hymns
that
were
discordantly
sung
in
the
stiff
old
parlors
there
was
a
suggestion
of
sunday
and
sanctity
too
in
the
odor
of
that
pervaded
the
room
the
windows
were
wide
open
also
and
the
scent
of
june
roses
came
in
with
all
the
languishing
sounds
of
a
summer
night
all
the
little
boys
had
a
scared
look
but
the
little
girls
were
never
so
pretty
and
demure
as
in
this
their
susceptible
seriousness
if
john
saw
a
boy
who
did
not
come
to
the
evening
meeting
but
was
wandering
off
with
his
sling
down
the
meadow
looking
for
frogs
maybe
that
boy
seemed
to
him
a
monster
of
wickedness
after
a
time
as
the
meetings
continued
john
fell
also
under
the
general
impression
of
fright
and
seriousness
all
the
talk
was
of
religion
and
he
heard
over
and
over
again
that
the
probability
was
if
he
did
not
get
it
now
he
never
would
the
chance
did
not
come
often
and
if
this
offer
was
not
improved
john
would
be
given
over
to
hardness
of
heart
his
obstinacy
would
show
that
he
was
not
one
of
the
elect
john
fancied
that
he
could
feel
his
heart
hardening
and
he
began
to
look
with
a
wistful
anxiety
into
the
faces
of
the
christians
to
see
what
were
the
visible
signs
of
being
one
of
the
elect
john
put
on
a
good
deal
of
a
manner
that
he
care
and
he
never
admitted
his
disquiet
by
asking
any
questions
or
standing
up
in
meeting
to
be
prayed
for
but
he
did
care
he
heard
all
the
time
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
repent
and
believe
but
there
was
nothing
that
he
doubted
and
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
repent
if
he
could
think
of
anything
to
repent
of
it
was
essential
he
learned
that
he
should
have
a
of
this
he
earnestly
tried
to
have
other
people
no
better
than
he
had
it
and
he
wondered
why
he
could
have
it
boys
and
girls
whom
he
knew
were
conviction
and
john
began
to
feel
not
only
panicky
but
lonesome
cynthia
rudd
had
been
anxious
for
days
and
days
and
not
able
to
sleep
at
night
but
now
she
had
given
herself
up
and
found
peace
there
was
a
kind
of
radiance
in
her
face
that
struck
john
with
awe
and
he
felt
that
now
there
was
a
great
gulf
between
him
and
cynthia
everybody
was
going
away
from
him
and
his
heart
was
getting
harder
than
ever
he
could
feel
wicked
all
he
could
do
and
there
was
ed
bates
his
intimate
friend
though
older
than
he
a
noisy
kind
of
boy
who
was
under
conviction
and
sure
he
was
going
to
be
lost
how
john
envied
him
and
pretty
soon
ed
john
anxiously
watched
the
change
in
ed
face
when
he
became
one
of
the
elect
and
a
change
there
was
and
john
wondered
about
another
thing
ed
bates
used
to
go
with
a
tremendously
long
pole
in
a
meadow
brook
near
the
river
and
when
the
trout
did
bite
right
off
ed
would
get
mad
and
as
soon
as
one
took
hold
he
would
give
an
awful
jerk
sending
the
fish
more
than
three
hundred
feet
into
the
air
and
landing
it
in
the
bushes
the
other
side
of
the
meadow
crying
out
darn
ye
i
learn
and
john
wondered
if
ed
would
take
the
little
trout
out
any
more
gently
now
john
felt
more
and
more
lonesome
as
one
after
another
of
his
playmates
came
out
and
made
a
profession
cynthia
she
too
was
older
than
john
sat
on
sunday
in
the
singers
seat
her
voice
which
was
going
to
be
a
contralto
had
a
wonderful
pathos
in
it
for
him
and
he
heard
it
with
a
heartache
she
is
thought
john
away
like
an
angel
in
heaven
and
i
am
left
during
all
his
after
life
a
contralto
voice
was
to
john
one
of
his
most
bitter
and
pleasures
it
suggested
the
immaculate
scornful
the
melancholy
unattainable
if
ever
a
boy
honestly
tried
to
work
himself
into
a
conviction
of
sin
john
tried
and
what
made
him
miserable
was
that
he
could
feel
miserable
when
everybody
else
was
miserable
he
even
began
to
pretend
to
be
so
he
put
on
a
serious
and
anxious
look
like
the
others
he
pretended
he
did
care
for
play
he
refrained
from
chasing
chipmunks
and
snaring
suckers
the
songs
of
birds
and
the
bright
vivacity
of
the
summer
time
that
used
to
make
him
turn
smote
him
as
a
discordant
levity
he
was
not
a
hypocrite
at
all
and
he
was
getting
to
be
alarmed
that
he
was
not
alarmed
at
himself
every
day
and
night
he
heard
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
would
probably
soon
quit
striving
with
him
and
leave
him
out
the
phrase
was
that
he
would
away
the
holy
john
wondered
if
he
was
not
doing
it
he
did
everything
to
put
himself
in
the
way
of
conviction
was
constant
at
the
evening
meetings
wore
a
grave
face
refrained
from
play
and
tried
to
feel
anxious
at
length
he
concluded
that
he
must
do
something
one
night
as
he
walked
home
from
a
solemn
meeting
at
which
several
of
his
little
playmates
had
forward
he
felt
that
he
could
force
the
crisis
he
was
alone
on
the
sandy
road
it
was
an
enchanting
summer
night
the
stars
danced
overhead
and
by
his
side
the
broad
and
shallow
river
ran
over
its
stony
bed
with
a
loud
but
soothing
murmur
that
filled
all
the
air
with
entreaty
john
did
not
then
know
that
it
sang
i
go
on
forever
yet
there
was
in
it
for
him
something
of
the
solemn
flow
of
the
eternal
world
when
he
came
in
sight
of
the
house
he
knelt
down
in
the
dust
by
a
pile
of
rails
and
prayed
he
prayed
that
he
might
feel
bad
and
be
distressed
about
himself
as
he
prayed
he
heard
distinctly
and
yet
not
as
a
disturbance
the
multitudinous
croaking
of
the
frogs
by
the
meadow
spring
it
was
not
discordant
with
his
thoughts
it
had
in
it
a
melancholy
pathos
as
if
it
were
a
kind
of
call
to
the
unconverted
what
is
there
in
this
sound
that
suggests
the
tenderness
of
spring
the
despair
of
a
summer
night
the
desolateness
of
young
love
years
after
it
happened
to
john
to
be
at
twilight
at
a
railway
station
on
the
edge
of
the
ravenna
marshes
a
little
way
over
the
purple
plain
he
saw
the
darkening
towers
and
heard
sweet
bells
of
the
holy
pontiff
pius
ix
was
born
at
imola
and
passed
his
boyhood
in
that
serene
and
moist
region
as
the
train
waited
john
heard
from
miles
of
marshes
round
about
the
evening
song
of
millions
of
frogs
louder
and
more
melancholy
and
entreating
than
the
vesper
call
of
the
bells
and
instantly
his
mind
went
back
for
the
association
of
sound
is
as
subtle
as
that
of
odor
to
the
prayer
years
ago
by
the
roadside
and
the
plaintive
appeal
of
the
unheeded
frogs
and
he
wondered
if
the
little
pope
had
not
heard
the
like
importunity
and
perhaps
when
he
thought
of
himself
as
a
little
pope
associated
his
conversion
with
this
plaintive
sound
john
prayed
but
without
feeling
any
worse
and
then
went
desperately
into
the
house
and
told
the
family
that
he
was
in
an
anxious
state
of
mind
this
was
joyful
news
to
the
sweet
and
pious
household
and
the
little
boy
was
urged
to
feel
that
he
was
a
sinner
to
repent
and
to
become
that
night
a
christian
he
was
prayed
over
and
told
to
read
the
bible
and
put
to
bed
with
the
injunction
to
repeat
all
the
texts
of
scripture
and
hymns
he
could
think
of
john
did
this
and
said
over
and
over
the
few
texts
he
was
master
of
and
tossed
about
in
a
real
discontent
now
for
he
had
a
dim
notion
that
he
was
playing
the
hypocrite
a
little
but
he
was
sincere
enough
in
wanting
to
feel
as
the
other
boys
and
girls
felt
that
he
was
a
wicked
sinner
he
tried
to
think
of
his
evil
deeds
and
one
occurred
to
him
indeed
it
often
came
to
his
mind
it
was
a
lie
a
deliberate
awful
lie
that
never
injured
anybody
but
himself
john
knew
he
was
not
wicked
enough
to
tell
a
lie
to
injure
anybody
else
this
was
the
lie
one
afternoon
at
school
just
before
john
class
was
to
recite
in
geography
his
pretty
cousin
a
young
lady
he
held
in
great
love
and
respect
came
in
to
visit
the
school
john
was
a
favorite
with
her
and
she
had
come
to
hear
him
recite
as
it
happened
john
felt
shaky
in
the
geographical
lesson
of
that
day
and
he
feared
to
be
humiliated
in
the
presence
of
his
cousin
he
felt
embarrassed
to
that
degree
that
he
could
have
massachusetts
so
he
stood
up
and
raised
his
hand
and
said
to
the
i
got
the
may
i
go
home
and
john
character
for
truthfulness
was
so
high
and
even
this
was
ever
a
reproach
to
him
that
his
word
was
instantly
believed
and
he
was
dismissed
without
any
medical
examination
for
a
moment
john
was
delighted
to
get
out
of
school
so
early
but
soon
his
guilt
took
all
the
light
out
of
the
summer
sky
and
the
pleasantness
out
of
nature
he
had
to
walk
slowly
without
a
single
hop
or
jump
as
became
a
diseased
boy
the
sight
of
a
woodchuck
at
a
distance
from
his
hole
tempted
john
but
he
restrained
himself
lest
somebody
should
see
him
and
know
that
chasing
a
woodchuck
was
inconsistent
with
the
he
was
acting
a
miserable
part
but
it
had
to
be
gone
through
with
he
went
home
and
told
his
mother
the
reason
he
had
left
school
but
he
added
that
he
felt
better
now
the
did
save
him
genuine
sympathy
was
lavished
on
him
he
had
to
swallow
a
stiff
dose
of
nasty
the
horror
of
all
childhood
and
he
was
put
in
bed
immediately
the
world
never
looked
so
pleasant
to
john
but
to
bed
he
was
forced
to
go
he
was
excused
from
all
chores
he
was
not
even
to
go
after
the
cows
john
said
he
thought
he
ought
to
go
after
the
cows
much
as
he
hated
the
business
usually
he
would
now
willingly
have
wandered
over
the
world
after
cows
and
for
this
heroic
offer
in
the
condition
he
was
he
got
credit
for
a
desire
to
do
his
duty
and
this
unjust
confidence
in
him
added
to
his
torture
and
he
had
intended
to
set
his
hooks
that
night
for
eels
his
cousin
came
home
and
sat
by
his
bedside
and
condoled
with
him
his
had
sent
word
how
sorry
she
was
for
him
john
was
such
a
good
boy
all
this
was
dreadful
he
groaned
in
agony
besides
he
was
not
to
have
any
supper
it
would
be
very
dangerous
to
eat
a
morsel
the
prospect
was
appalling
never
was
there
such
a
long
twilight
never
before
did
he
hear
so
many
sounds
outdoors
that
he
wanted
to
investigate
being
ill
without
any
illness
was
a
horrible
condition
and
he
began
to
have
real
now
and
it
ached
because
it
was
empty
john
was
hungry
enough
to
have
eaten
the
new
england
primer
but
by
and
by
sleep
came
and
john
forgot
his
woes
in
dreaming
that
he
knew
where
madagascar
was
just
as
easy
as
anything
it
was
this
lie
that
came
back
to
john
the
night
he
was
trying
to
be
affected
by
the
revival
and
he
was
very
much
ashamed
of
it
and
believed
he
would
never
tell
another
but
then
he
fell
thinking
whether
with
the
and
the
going
to
bed
in
the
afternoon
and
the
loss
of
his
supper
he
had
not
been
sufficiently
paid
for
it
and
in
this
unhopeful
frame
of
mind
he
dropped
off
in
sleep
and
the
truth
must
be
told
that
in
the
morning
john
was
no
nearer
to
realizing
the
terrors
he
desired
to
feel
but
he
was
a
conscientious
boy
and
would
do
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
influences
of
the
season
he
not
only
put
himself
away
from
them
all
but
he
refrained
from
doing
almost
everything
that
he
wanted
to
do
there
came
at
that
time
a
newspaper
a
secular
newspaper
which
had
in
it
a
long
account
of
the
long
island
races
in
which
the
famous
horse
was
a
runner
john
was
fond
of
horses
he
knew
about
lexington
and
he
had
looked
forward
to
the
result
of
this
race
with
keen
interest
but
to
read
the
account
of
it
how
he
felt
might
destroy
his
seriousness
of
mind
and
in
all
reverence
and
simplicity
he
felt
it
be
a
means
of
away
the
holy
he
therefore
hid
away
the
paper
in
a
intending
to
read
it
when
the
revival
should
be
over
weeks
after
when
he
looked
for
the
newspaper
it
was
not
to
be
found
and
john
never
knew
what
lexington
made
nor
anything
about
the
race
this
was
to
him
a
serious
loss
but
by
no
means
so
deep
as
another
feeling
that
remained
with
him
for
when
his
little
world
returned
to
its
ordinary
course
and
long
after
john
had
an
uneasy
apprehension
of
his
own
separateness
from
other
people
in
his
insensibility
to
the
revival
perhaps
the
experience
was
a
damage
to
him
and
it
is
a
pity
that
there
was
no
one
to
explain
that
religion
for
a
little
fellow
like
him
is
not
a
xvii
war
every
boy
who
is
good
for
anything
is
a
natural
savage
the
scientists
who
want
to
study
the
primitive
man
and
have
so
much
difficulty
in
finding
one
anywhere
in
this
sophisticated
age
could
do
better
than
to
devote
their
attention
to
the
common
he
has
the
primal
vigorous
instincts
and
impulses
of
the
african
savage
without
any
of
the
vices
inherited
from
a
civilization
long
ago
decayed
or
developed
in
an
unrestrained
barbaric
society
you
want
to
catch
your
boy
young
and
study
him
before
he
has
either
virtues
or
vices
in
order
to
understand
the
primitive
man
every
new
england
boy
desires
or
did
desire
a
generation
ago
before
children
were
born
sophisticated
with
a
large
library
and
with
the
word
written
on
their
brows
to
live
by
hunting
fishing
and
war
the
military
instinct
which
is
the
special
mark
of
barbarism
is
strong
in
him
it
arises
not
alone
from
his
love
of
fighting
for
the
boy
is
naturally
as
cowardly
as
the
savage
but
from
his
fondness
for
display
the
same
that
a
corporal
or
a
general
feels
in
decking
himself
in
tinsel
and
tawdry
colors
and
strutting
about
in
view
of
the
female
sex
half
the
pleasure
in
going
out
to
murder
another
man
with
a
gun
would
be
wanting
if
one
did
not
wear
feathers
and
and
stripes
on
his
pantaloons
the
law
also
takes
this
view
of
it
and
will
not
permit
men
to
shoot
each
other
in
plain
clothes
and
the
world
also
makes
some
curious
distinctions
in
the
art
of
killing
to
kill
people
with
arrows
is
barbarous
to
kill
them
with
and
flintlock
muskets
is
to
kill
them
with
rifles
is
civilized
that
nation
is
the
most
civilized
which
has
the
appliances
to
kill
the
most
of
another
nation
in
the
shortest
time
this
is
the
result
of
six
thousand
years
of
constant
civilization
by
and
by
when
the
nations
cease
to
be
boys
perhaps
they
will
not
want
to
kill
each
other
at
all
some
people
think
the
world
is
very
old
but
here
is
an
evidence
that
it
is
very
young
and
in
fact
has
scarcely
yet
begun
to
be
a
world
when
the
volcanoes
have
done
spouting
and
the
earthquakes
are
quaked
out
and
you
can
tell
what
land
is
going
to
be
solid
and
keep
its
level
hours
and
the
swamps
are
filled
up
and
the
deltas
of
the
great
rivers
like
the
mississippi
and
the
nile
become
terra
firma
and
men
stop
killing
their
fellows
in
order
to
get
their
land
and
other
property
then
perhaps
there
will
be
a
world
that
an
angel
would
weep
over
now
one
half
the
world
are
employed
in
getting
ready
to
kill
the
other
half
some
of
them
by
marching
about
in
uniform
and
the
others
by
hard
work
to
earn
money
to
pay
taxes
to
buy
uniforms
and
guns
john
was
not
naturally
very
cruel
and
it
was
probably
the
love
of
display
quite
as
much
as
of
fighting
that
led
him
into
a
military
life
for
he
in
common
with
all
his
comrades
had
other
traits
of
the
savage
one
of
them
was
the
same
passion
for
ornament
that
induces
the
african
to
wear
anklets
and
bracelets
of
hide
and
of
metal
and
to
decorate
himself
with
tufts
of
hair
and
to
tattoo
his
body
in
john
day
there
was
a
rage
at
school
among
the
boys
for
wearing
bracelets
woven
of
the
hair
of
the
little
girls
some
of
them
were
wonderful
specimens
of
braiding
and
twist
these
were
not
captured
in
war
but
were
sentimental
tokens
of
friendship
given
by
the
young
maidens
themselves
john
own
hair
was
kept
so
short
as
became
a
warrior
that
you
could
have
made
a
bracelet
out
of
it
or
anything
except
a
paintbrush
but
the
little
girls
were
not
under
military
law
and
they
willingly
sacrificed
their
tresses
to
decorate
the
soldiers
they
esteemed
as
the
indian
is
honored
in
proportion
to
the
scalps
he
can
display
at
john
school
the
boy
was
held
in
highest
respect
who
could
show
the
most
hair
trophies
on
his
wrist
john
himself
had
a
variety
that
would
have
pleased
a
mohawk
fine
and
coarse
and
of
all
colors
there
were
the
flaxen
the
faded
straw
the
glossy
black
the
lustrous
brown
the
dirty
yellow
the
undecided
auburn
and
the
fiery
red
perhaps
his
pulse
beat
more
quickly
under
the
red
hair
of
cynthia
rudd
than
on
account
of
all
the
other
wristlets
put
together
it
was
a
sort
of
to
john
and
burned
there
with
a
steady
flame
now
that
cynthia
had
become
a
christian
this
band
of
hair
seemed
a
more
sacred
if
less
glowing
possession
for
all
detached
hair
will
fade
in
time
and
if
he
had
known
anything
about
saints
he
would
have
imagined
that
it
was
a
part
of
the
aureole
that
always
goes
with
a
saint
but
i
am
bound
to
say
that
while
john
had
a
tender
feeling
for
this
red
string
his
sentiment
was
not
that
of
the
man
who
becomes
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
a
hair
and
he
valued
rather
the
number
than
the
quality
of
these
elastic
wristlets
john
burned
with
as
real
a
military
ardor
as
ever
inflamed
the
breast
of
any
slaughterer
of
his
fellows
he
liked
to
read
of
war
of
encounters
with
the
indians
of
any
kind
of
wholesale
killing
in
glittering
uniform
to
the
noise
of
the
terribly
exciting
fife
and
drum
which
maddened
the
combatants
and
drowned
the
cries
of
the
wounded
in
his
future
he
saw
himself
a
soldier
with
plume
and
sword
and
decorated
clothes
very
different
from
his
somewhat
roomy
trousers
and
roundabout
made
by
aunt
ellis
the
village
tailoress
who
cut
out
clothes
not
according
to
the
shape
of
the
boy
but
to
what
he
was
expected
to
grow
to
going
where
glory
awaited
him
in
his
observation
of
pictures
it
was
the
common
soldier
who
was
always
falling
and
dying
while
the
officer
stood
unharmed
in
the
storm
of
bullets
and
waved
his
sword
in
a
heroic
attitude
john
determined
to
be
an
officer
it
is
needless
to
say
that
he
was
an
ardent
member
of
the
military
company
of
his
village
he
had
risen
from
the
grade
of
corporal
to
that
of
first
lieutenant
the
captain
was
a
boy
whose
father
was
captain
of
the
grown
militia
company
and
consequently
had
inherited
military
aptness
and
knowledge
the
old
captain
was
a
flaming
son
of
mars
whose
nose
militia
war
general
training
and
new
england
rum
had
painted
with
the
color
of
glory
and
disaster
he
was
one
of
the
gallant
old
soldiers
of
the
peaceful
days
of
our
country
splendid
in
uniform
a
martinet
in
drill
terrible
in
oaths
a
glorious
object
when
he
marched
at
the
head
of
his
company
of
flintlock
muskets
with
the
american
banner
full
high
advanced
and
the
clamorous
drum
defying
the
world
in
this
he
fulfilled
his
duties
of
citizen
faithfully
teaching
his
uniformed
companions
how
to
march
by
the
left
leg
and
to
get
reeling
drunk
by
sundown
otherwise
he
did
amount
to
much
in
the
community
his
house
was
unpainted
his
fences
were
tumbled
down
his
farm
was
a
waste
his
wife
wore
an
old
gown
to
meeting
to
which
the
captain
never
went
but
he
was
a
good
and
there
was
no
man
in
town
who
spent
more
time
at
the
country
store
and
made
more
shrewd
observations
upon
the
affairs
of
his
neighbors
although
he
had
never
been
in
an
asylum
any
more
than
he
had
been
in
war
he
was
almost
as
perfect
a
drunkard
as
he
was
soldier
he
hated
the
british
whom
he
had
never
seen
as
much
as
he
loved
rum
from
which
he
was
never
separated
the
company
which
his
son
commanded
wearing
his
father
belt
and
sword
was
about
as
effective
as
the
old
company
and
more
orderly
it
contained
from
thirty
to
fifty
boys
according
to
the
pressure
of
at
home
and
it
had
its
great
days
of
parade
and
its
autumn
maneuvers
like
the
general
training
it
was
an
artillery
company
which
gave
every
boy
a
chance
to
wear
a
sword
and
it
possessed
a
small
mounted
cannon
which
was
dragged
about
and
limbered
and
unlimbered
and
fired
to
the
imminent
danger
of
everybody
especially
of
the
company
in
point
of
marching
with
all
the
legs
going
together
and
twisting
itself
up
and
untwisting
breaking
into
for
indian
fighting
and
forming
platoons
turning
a
sharp
corner
and
getting
out
of
the
way
of
a
wagon
circling
the
town
pump
frightening
horses
stopping
short
in
front
of
the
tavern
with
ranks
dressed
and
eyes
right
and
left
it
was
the
equal
of
any
military
organization
i
ever
saw
it
could
train
better
than
the
big
company
and
i
think
it
did
more
good
in
keeping
alive
the
spirit
of
patriotism
and
desire
to
fight
its
discipline
was
strict
if
a
boy
left
the
ranks
to
jab
a
spectator
or
make
faces
at
a
window
or
a
striped
snake
he
was
at
no
end
it
was
altogether
a
very
serious
business
there
was
no
levity
about
the
hot
and
hard
marching
and
as
boys
have
no
humor
nothing
ludicrous
occurred
john
was
very
proud
of
his
office
and
of
his
ability
to
keep
the
rear
ranks
closed
up
and
ready
to
execute
any
maneuver
when
the
captain
which
he
did
continually
he
carried
a
real
sword
which
his
grandfather
had
worn
in
many
a
militia
campaign
on
the
village
green
the
rust
upon
which
john
fancied
was
indian
blood
he
had
various
red
and
yellow
insignia
of
military
rank
sewed
upon
different
parts
of
his
clothes
and
though
his
cocked
hat
was
of
pasteboard
it
was
decorated
with
gilding
and
bright
rosettes
and
floated
a
red
feather
that
made
his
heart
beat
with
martial
fury
whenever
he
looked
at
it
the
effect
of
this
uniform
upon
the
girls
was
not
a
matter
of
conjecture
i
think
they
really
cared
nothing
about
it
but
they
pretended
to
think
it
fine
and
they
fed
the
poor
boy
vanity
the
weakness
by
which
women
govern
the
world
the
exalted
happiness
of
john
in
this
military
service
i
daresay
was
never
equaled
in
any
subsequent
occupation
the
display
of
the
company
in
the
village
filled
him
with
the
loftiest
heroism
there
was
nothing
wanting
but
an
enemy
to
fight
but
this
could
only
be
had
by
half
the
company
staining
themselves
with
elderberry
juice
and
going
into
the
woods
as
indians
to
fight
the
artillery
from
behind
trees
with
bows
and
arrows
or
to
ambush
it
and
tomahawk
the
gunners
this
however
was
made
to
seem
very
like
real
war
traditions
of
indian
cruelty
were
still
fresh
in
western
massachusetts
behind
john
house
in
the
orchard
were
some
old
slate
tombstones
sunken
and
leaning
which
recorded
the
names
of
captain
moses
rice
and
phineas
arms
who
had
been
killed
by
indians
in
the
last
century
while
at
work
in
the
meadow
by
the
river
and
who
slept
there
in
the
hope
of
the
glorious
resurrection
phineas
arms
martial
name
was
long
since
dust
and
even
the
mortal
part
of
the
great
captain
moses
rice
had
been
absorbed
in
the
soil
and
passed
perhaps
with
the
sap
up
into
the
old
but
still
blooming
it
was
a
quiet
place
where
they
lay
but
they
might
have
heard
if
hear
they
could
the
loud
continuous
roar
of
the
deerfield
and
the
stirring
of
the
long
grass
on
that
sunny
slope
there
was
a
tradition
that
years
ago
an
indian
probably
the
last
of
his
race
had
been
seen
moving
along
the
crest
of
the
mountain
and
gazing
down
into
the
lovely
valley
which
had
been
the
favorite
home
of
his
tribe
upon
the
fields
where
he
grew
his
corn
and
the
sparkling
stream
whence
he
drew
his
fish
john
used
to
fancy
at
times
as
he
sat
there
that
he
could
see
that
red
specter
gliding
among
the
trees
on
the
hill
and
if
the
tombstone
suggested
to
him
the
trump
of
judgment
he
could
not
separate
it
from
the
that
had
been
the
last
sound
in
the
ear
of
phineas
arms
the
indian
always
preceded
murder
by
the
and
this
was
an
advantage
that
the
artillery
had
in
the
fight
with
the
elderberry
indians
it
was
warned
in
time
if
there
was
no
the
killing
did
count
the
artillery
man
got
up
and
killed
the
indian
the
indian
usually
had
the
worst
of
it
he
not
only
got
killed
by
the
regulars
but
he
got
whipped
by
the
home
guard
at
night
for
staining
himself
and
his
clothes
with
the
elderberry
but
once
a
year
the
company
had
a
superlative
parade
this
was
when
the
military
company
from
the
north
part
of
the
town
joined
the
villagers
in
a
general
muster
this
was
an
infantry
company
and
not
to
be
compared
with
that
of
the
village
in
point
of
evolutions
there
was
a
great
and
natural
hatred
between
the
north
town
boys
and
the
center
i
do
know
why
but
no
contiguous
african
tribes
could
be
more
hostile
it
was
all
right
for
one
of
either
section
to
the
other
if
he
could
or
for
half
a
dozen
to
one
of
the
enemy
if
they
caught
him
alone
the
notion
of
honor
as
of
mercy
comes
into
the
boy
only
when
he
is
pretty
well
grown
to
some
neither
ever
comes
and
yet
there
was
an
artificial
military
courtesy
something
like
that
existing
in
the
feudal
age
no
doubt
which
put
the
meeting
of
these
two
rival
and
mutually
detested
companies
on
a
high
plane
of
behavior
it
was
beautiful
to
see
the
seriousness
of
this
lofty
and
studied
condescension
on
both
sides
for
the
time
everything
was
under
martial
law
the
village
company
being
the
senior
its
captain
commanded
the
united
battalion
in
the
march
and
this
put
john
temporarily
into
the
position
of
captain
with
the
right
to
march
at
the
head
and
a
responsibility
which
realized
all
his
hopes
of
glory
i
suppose
there
has
yet
been
discovered
by
man
no
gratification
like
that
of
marching
at
the
head
of
a
column
in
uniform
on
parade
unless
perhaps
it
is
marching
at
their
head
when
they
are
leaving
a
field
of
battle
john
experienced
all
the
thrill
of
this
conspicuous
authority
and
i
daresay
that
nothing
in
his
later
life
has
so
exalted
him
in
his
own
esteem
certainly
nothing
has
since
happened
that
was
so
important
as
the
events
of
that
parade
day
seemed
he
satiated
himself
with
all
the
delights
of
war
xviii
country
scenes
it
is
impossible
to
say
at
what
age
a
new
england
becomes
conscious
that
his
are
too
short
and
is
anxious
about
the
part
of
his
hair
and
the
fit
of
his
roundabout
these
harrowing
thoughts
come
to
him
later
than
to
the
city
lad
at
least
a
generation
ago
he
served
a
long
apprenticeship
with
nature
only
for
a
master
absolutely
unconscious
of
the
artificialities
of
life
but
i
do
not
think
his
early
education
was
neglected
and
yet
it
is
easy
to
underestimate
the
influences
that
unconsciously
to
him
were
expanding
his
mind
and
nursing
in
him
heroic
purposes
there
was
the
lovely
but
narrow
valley
with
its
rapid
mountain
stream
there
were
the
great
hills
which
he
climbed
only
to
see
other
hills
stretching
away
to
a
broken
and
tempting
horizon
there
were
the
rocky
pastures
and
the
wide
sweeps
of
forest
through
which
the
winter
tempests
howled
upon
which
hung
the
haze
of
summer
heat
over
which
the
great
shadows
of
summer
clouds
traveled
there
were
the
clouds
themselves
shouldering
up
above
the
peaks
hurrying
across
the
narrow
sky
the
clouds
out
of
which
the
wind
came
and
the
lightning
and
the
sudden
dashes
of
rain
and
there
were
days
when
the
sky
was
ineffably
blue
and
distant
a
fathomless
vault
of
heaven
where
the
and
the
eagle
poised
on
outstretched
wings
and
watched
for
their
prey
can
you
say
how
these
things
fed
the
imagination
of
the
boy
who
had
few
books
and
no
contact
with
the
great
world
do
you
think
any
city
lad
could
have
written
at
eighteen
if
you
had
seen
john
in
his
short
and
roomy
trousers
and
straw
hat
picking
his
barefooted
way
over
the
rocks
along
the
of
a
cool
morning
to
see
if
an
eel
had
on
you
would
not
have
fancied
that
he
lived
in
an
ideal
world
nor
did
he
consciously
so
far
as
he
knew
he
had
no
more
sentiment
than
a
although
he
loved
cynthia
rudd
devotedly
and
blushed
scarlet
one
day
when
his
cousin
found
a
lock
of
cynthia
flaming
hair
in
the
box
where
john
kept
his
fishhooks
spruce
gum
tickets
of
standing
at
the
head
gimlet
in
blue
ink
a
vile
liquid
in
a
bottle
to
make
fish
bite
and
other
precious
possessions
yet
cynthia
society
had
no
attractions
for
him
comparable
to
a
day
she
was
after
all
only
a
single
and
a
very
undefined
item
in
his
general
ideal
world
and
there
was
no
harm
in
letting
his
imagination
play
about
her
illumined
head
since
cynthia
had
and
john
had
got
nothing
his
love
was
tempered
with
a
little
awe
and
a
feeling
of
distance
he
was
not
fickle
and
yet
i
can
not
say
that
he
was
not
ready
to
construct
a
new
romance
in
which
cynthia
should
be
eliminated
nothing
was
easier
perhaps
it
was
a
luxurious
traveling
carriage
drawn
by
two
splendid
horses
in
plated
harness
driven
along
the
sandy
road
there
were
a
gentleman
and
a
young
lad
on
the
front
seat
and
on
the
back
seat
a
handsome
pale
lady
with
a
little
girl
beside
her
behind
on
the
rack
with
the
trunk
was
a
colored
boy
an
imp
out
of
a
john
was
told
that
the
black
boy
was
a
slave
and
that
the
carriage
was
from
baltimore
here
was
a
chance
for
a
romance
slavery
beauty
wealth
haughtiness
especially
on
the
part
of
the
slender
boy
on
the
front
seat
here
was
an
opening
into
a
vast
realm
the
horses
and
the
shining
harness
were
enough
to
excite
john
admiration
but
these
were
nothing
to
the
little
girl
his
eyes
had
never
before
fallen
upon
that
kind
of
girl
he
had
hardly
imagined
that
such
a
lovely
creature
could
exist
was
it
the
soft
and
dainty
toilet
was
it
the
brown
curls
or
the
large
laughing
eyes
or
the
delicate
finely
cut
features
or
the
charming
little
figure
of
this
person
was
this
expression
on
her
mobile
face
merely
that
of
amusement
at
seeing
a
then
john
hated
her
on
the
contrary
did
she
see
in
him
what
john
felt
himself
to
be
then
he
would
go
the
world
over
to
serve
her
in
a
moment
he
was
his
trousers
seemed
to
creep
higher
up
his
legs
and
he
could
feel
his
very
ankles
blush
he
hoped
that
she
had
not
seen
the
other
side
of
him
for
in
fact
the
patches
were
not
of
the
exact
shade
of
the
rest
of
the
cloth
the
vision
flashed
by
him
in
a
moment
but
it
left
him
with
a
resentful
feeling
perhaps
that
proud
little
girl
would
be
sorry
some
day
when
he
had
become
a
general
or
written
a
book
or
kept
a
store
to
see
him
go
away
and
marry
another
he
almost
made
up
his
cruel
mind
on
the
instant
that
he
would
never
marry
her
however
bad
she
might
feel
and
yet
he
could
get
her
out
of
his
mind
for
days
and
days
and
when
her
image
was
present
even
cynthia
in
the
singers
seat
on
sunday
looked
a
little
cheap
and
common
poor
cynthia
long
before
john
became
a
general
or
had
his
revenge
on
the
baltimore
girl
she
married
a
farmer
and
was
the
mother
of
children
and
when
john
saw
her
years
after
she
looked
tired
and
discouraged
as
one
who
has
carried
into
womanhood
none
of
the
romance
of
her
youth
fishing
and
dreaming
i
think
were
the
best
amusements
john
had
the
middle
pier
of
the
long
covered
bridge
over
the
river
stood
upon
a
great
rock
and
this
rock
which
was
known
as
the
whence
the
boys
on
summer
evenings
dove
into
the
deep
pool
by
its
side
was
a
favorite
spot
with
john
when
he
could
get
an
hour
or
two
from
the
everlasting
making
his
way
out
to
it
over
the
rocks
at
low
water
with
his
there
he
was
content
to
sit
and
observe
the
world
and
there
he
saw
a
great
deal
of
life
he
always
expected
to
catch
the
legendary
trout
which
weighed
two
pounds
and
was
believed
to
inhabit
that
pool
he
always
did
catch
horned
dace
and
shiners
which
he
despised
and
sometimes
he
snared
a
monstrous
sucker
a
foot
and
a
half
long
but
in
the
summer
the
sucker
is
a
flabby
fish
and
john
was
not
thanked
for
bringing
him
home
he
liked
however
to
lie
with
his
face
close
to
the
water
and
watch
the
long
fishes
panting
in
the
clear
depths
and
occasionally
he
would
drop
a
pebble
near
one
to
see
how
gracefully
he
would
scud
away
with
one
wave
of
the
tail
into
deeper
water
nothing
fears
the
little
brown
boy
the
slants
his
wings
almost
touches
the
deep
water
before
him
and
then
escapes
away
under
the
bridge
to
the
east
with
a
glint
of
sunshine
on
his
back
the
comes
down
with
a
swoop
dips
one
wing
and
his
prey
having
darted
under
a
stone
is
away
again
over
the
still
hill
high
soaring
on
pinions
keeping
an
eye
perhaps
upon
the
great
eagle
which
is
sweeping
the
sky
in
widening
circles
but
there
is
other
life
a
wagon
rumbles
over
the
bridge
and
the
farmer
and
his
wife
jogging
along
do
not
know
that
they
have
startled
a
lazy
boy
into
a
momentary
fancy
that
a
is
coming
up
john
can
see
as
he
lies
there
on
a
still
summer
day
with
the
fishes
and
the
birds
for
company
the
road
that
comes
down
the
left
bank
of
the
river
a
hot
sandy
road
hidden
from
view
here
and
there
by
trees
and
bushes
the
chief
point
of
interest
however
is
an
enormous
by
the
roadside
and
in
front
of
john
house
the
house
is
more
than
a
century
old
and
its
timbers
were
hewed
and
squared
by
captain
moses
rice
who
lies
in
his
grave
on
the
hillside
above
it
in
the
presence
of
the
red
man
who
killed
him
with
arrow
and
tomahawk
some
time
after
his
house
was
set
in
order
the
gigantic
tree
struck
with
a
sort
of
leprosy
like
all
its
species
appears
much
older
and
of
course
has
its
tradition
they
say
that
it
grew
from
a
green
stake
which
the
first
planted
there
for
one
of
his
points
of
sight
john
was
reminded
of
it
years
after
when
he
sat
under
the
shade
of
the
decrepit
in
freiburg
and
was
told
that
it
was
originally
a
twig
which
the
breathless
and
bloody
messenger
carried
in
his
hand
when
he
dropped
exhausted
in
the
square
with
the
word
on
his
lips
announcing
thus
the
result
of
the
glorious
battle
of
morat
where
the
swiss
in
defeated
charles
the
bold
under
the
broad
but
scanty
shade
of
the
great
tree
as
it
was
called
stood
an
old
with
its
penstock
and
spout
pouring
forever
cold
sparkling
water
into
the
overflowing
trough
it
is
fed
by
a
spring
near
by
and
the
water
is
sweeter
and
colder
than
any
in
the
known
world
unless
it
be
the
well
as
generations
of
people
and
horses
which
have
drunk
of
it
would
testify
if
they
could
come
back
and
if
they
could
file
along
this
road
again
what
a
procession
there
would
be
riding
down
the
valley
antiquated
vehicles
rusty
wagons
adorned
with
the
invariable
even
in
the
hottest
days
lean
and
horses
frisky
colts
drawing
generation
after
generation
the
sober
and
pious
saints
that
passed
this
way
to
meeting
and
to
mill
what
a
refreshment
is
that
all
day
long
there
are
pilgrims
to
it
and
john
likes
nothing
better
than
to
watch
them
here
comes
a
gray
horse
drawing
a
buggy
with
two
men
cattle
buyers
probably
out
jumps
a
man
down
goes
the
what
a
good
draught
the
nag
takes
here
comes
a
trotter
in
a
sulky
man
in
a
brown
linen
coat
and
hat
dissolute
man
they
turn
up
of
course
ah
there
is
an
establishment
he
knows
well
a
sorrel
horse
and
an
old
chaise
the
sorrel
horse
scents
the
water
afar
off
and
begins
to
turn
up
long
before
he
reaches
the
trough
thrusting
out
his
nose
in
anticipation
of
the
coot
sensation
no
check
to
let
down
he
plunges
his
nose
in
nearly
to
his
eyes
in
his
haste
to
get
at
it
two
maiden
ladies
unmistakably
such
though
they
appear
neither
nor
within
the
smile
benevolently
on
the
sorrel
back
it
is
the
deacon
horse
a
nag
with
a
sedate
leisurely
jog
as
he
goes
and
these
are
two
of
the
of
the
earth
the
brevet
rank
of
the
women
who
stand
and
wait
going
down
to
the
village
store
to
dicker
there
come
two
men
in
a
hurry
horse
driven
up
smartly
and
pulled
up
short
but
as
it
is
rising
ground
and
the
horse
does
not
easily
reach
the
water
with
the
wagon
pulling
back
the
nervous
man
in
the
buggy
hitches
forward
on
his
seat
as
if
that
would
carry
the
wagon
a
little
ahead
next
with
load
of
boards
horse
wants
to
turn
up
and
driver
switches
him
and
cries
and
the
horse
reluctantly
goes
by
turning
his
head
wistfully
towards
the
flowing
spout
ah
here
comes
an
equipage
strange
to
these
parts
and
john
stands
up
to
look
an
elegant
carriage
and
two
horses
trunks
strapped
on
behind
gentleman
and
boy
on
front
seat
and
two
ladies
on
back
seat
city
people
the
gentleman
descends
unchecks
the
horses
wipes
his
brow
takes
a
drink
at
the
spout
and
looks
around
evidently
remarking
upon
the
lovely
view
as
he
swings
his
handkerchief
in
an
explanatory
manner
judicious
travelers
john
would
like
to
know
who
they
are
perhaps
they
are
from
boston
whence
come
all
the
wonderfully
painted
peddlers
wagons
drawn
by
six
stalwart
horses
which
the
driver
using
no
rein
controls
with
his
long
whip
and
cheery
voice
if
so
great
is
the
condescension
of
boston
and
john
follows
them
with
an
undefined
longing
as
they
drive
away
toward
the
mountains
of
zoar
here
is
a
footman
dusty
and
tired
who
comes
with
lagging
steps
he
stops
removes
his
hat
as
he
should
to
such
a
tree
puts
his
mouth
to
the
spout
and
takes
a
long
pull
at
the
lively
water
and
then
he
goes
on
perhaps
to
zoar
perhaps
to
a
worse
place
so
they
come
and
go
all
the
summer
afternoon
but
the
great
event
of
the
day
is
the
passing
down
the
valley
of
the
majestic
the
vast
rattling
vehicle
john
can
hear
a
mile
off
the
shaking
of
chains
traces
and
and
the
creaking
of
its
leathern
braces
as
the
great
bulk
swings
along
piled
high
with
trunks
it
represents
to
john
somehow
authority
government
the
right
of
way
the
driver
is
an
autocrat
everybody
must
make
way
for
the
it
almost
satisfies
the
imagination
this
royal
vehicle
one
can
go
in
it
to
the
confines
of
the
world
to
boston
and
to
albany
there
were
other
influences
that
i
daresay
contributed
to
the
education
i
think
his
imagination
was
stimulated
by
a
band
of
gypsies
who
used
to
come
every
summer
and
pitch
a
tent
on
a
little
roadside
patch
of
green
turf
by
the
not
far
from
his
house
it
was
shaded
by
elms
and
and
a
long
spit
of
sand
and
pebbles
ran
out
from
it
into
the
brawling
stream
probably
they
were
not
a
very
good
kind
of
gypsy
although
the
story
was
that
the
men
drank
and
beat
the
women
john
did
know
much
about
drinking
his
experience
of
it
was
confined
to
sweet
cider
yet
he
had
already
set
himself
up
as
a
reformer
and
joined
the
cold
water
band
the
object
of
this
band
was
to
walk
in
a
procession
under
a
banner
that
declared
here
we
pledge
perpetual
hate
to
all
that
can
intoxicate
and
wear
a
badge
with
this
legend
and
above
it
the
device
of
a
with
a
long
sweep
it
kept
john
and
all
the
little
boys
and
girls
from
being
drunkards
till
they
were
ten
or
eleven
years
of
age
though
perhaps
a
few
of
them
died
meantime
from
eating
and
pie
and
drinking
water
at
the
celebrations
of
the
band
the
gypsy
camp
had
a
strange
fascination
for
john
mingled
of
curiosity
and
fear
nothing
more
alien
could
come
into
the
new
england
life
than
this
tatterdemalion
band
it
was
hardly
credible
that
here
were
actually
people
who
lived
who
slept
in
their
covered
wagon
or
under
their
tent
and
cooked
in
the
open
air
it
was
a
visible
romance
transferred
from
foreign
lands
and
the
remote
times
of
the
and
john
took
these
city
thieves
who
were
on
their
annual
foray
into
the
country
trading
and
stealing
horses
and
robbing
and
cornfields
for
the
mysterious
race
who
for
thousands
of
years
have
done
these
same
things
in
all
lands
by
right
of
their
pure
blood
and
ancient
lineage
john
was
afraid
to
approach
the
camp
when
any
of
the
scowling
and
villainous
men
were
lounging
about
pipes
in
mouth
but
he
took
more
courage
when
only
women
and
children
were
visible
the
swarthy
women
in
dirty
calico
frocks
were
anything
but
attractive
but
they
spoke
softly
to
the
boy
and
told
his
fortune
and
wheedled
him
into
bringing
them
any
amount
of
cucumbers
and
green
corn
in
the
course
of
the
season
in
front
of
the
tent
were
planted
in
the
ground
three
poles
that
met
together
at
the
top
whence
depended
a
kettle
this
was
the
kitchen
and
it
was
sufficient
the
fuel
for
the
fire
was
the
driftwood
of
the
stream
john
noted
that
it
did
not
require
to
be
sawed
into
and
in
short
that
the
about
this
establishment
were
reduced
to
the
minimum
and
an
older
person
than
john
might
envy
the
free
life
of
these
wanderers
who
paid
neither
rent
nor
taxes
and
yet
enjoyed
all
the
delights
of
nature
it
seemed
to
the
boy
that
affairs
would
go
more
smoothly
in
the
world
if
everybody
would
live
in
this
simple
manner
nor
did
he
then
know
or
ever
after
find
out
why
it
is
that
the
world
permits
only
wicked
people
to
be
bohemians
xix
a
contrast
to
the
new
england
boy
one
evening
at
vespers
in
genoa
attracted
by
a
burst
of
music
from
the
swinging
curtain
of
the
doorway
i
entered
a
little
church
much
frequented
by
the
common
people
an
unexpected
and
exceedingly
pretty
sight
rewarded
me
it
was
all
souls
day
in
italy
almost
every
day
is
set
apart
for
some
festival
or
belongs
to
some
saint
or
another
and
i
suppose
that
when
leap
year
brings
around
the
extra
day
there
is
a
saint
ready
to
claim
the
of
february
whatever
the
day
was
to
the
elders
the
evening
was
devoted
to
the
children
the
first
thing
i
noticed
was
that
the
quaint
old
church
was
lighted
up
with
innumerable
wax
tapers
an
uncommon
sight
for
the
darkness
of
a
catholic
church
in
the
evening
is
usually
relieved
only
by
a
candle
here
and
there
and
by
a
blazing
pyramid
of
them
on
the
high
altar
the
use
of
gas
is
held
to
be
a
vulgar
thing
all
over
europe
and
especially
unfit
for
a
church
or
an
aristocratic
palace
then
i
saw
that
each
taper
belonged
to
a
little
boy
or
girl
and
the
groups
of
children
were
scattered
all
about
the
church
there
was
a
group
by
every
side
altar
and
chapel
all
the
benches
were
occupied
by
knots
of
them
and
there
were
so
many
circles
of
them
seated
on
the
pavement
that
i
could
with
difficulty
make
my
way
among
them
there
were
hundreds
of
children
in
the
church
all
dressed
in
their
holiday
apparel
and
all
intent
upon
the
illumination
which
seemed
to
be
a
private
affair
to
each
one
of
them
and
not
much
effect
had
their
tapers
upon
the
darkness
of
the
vast
vaults
above
them
the
tapers
were
little
spiral
coils
of
wax
which
the
children
unrolled
as
fast
as
they
burned
and
when
they
were
tired
of
holding
them
they
rested
them
on
the
ground
and
watched
the
burning
i
stood
some
time
by
a
group
of
a
dozen
seated
in
a
corner
of
the
church
they
had
massed
all
the
tapers
in
the
center
and
formed
a
ring
about
the
spectacle
sitting
with
their
legs
straight
out
before
them
and
their
toes
turned
up
the
light
shone
full
in
their
happy
faces
and
made
the
group
enveloped
otherwise
in
darkness
like
one
of
correggio
pictures
of
children
or
angels
correggio
was
a
famous
italian
artist
of
the
sixteenth
century
who
painted
cherubs
like
children
who
were
just
going
to
heaven
and
children
like
cherubs
who
had
just
come
out
of
it
but
then
he
had
the
italian
children
for
models
and
they
get
the
knack
of
being
lovely
very
young
an
italian
child
finds
it
as
easy
to
be
pretty
as
an
american
child
to
be
good
one
could
not
but
be
struck
with
the
patience
these
little
people
exhibited
in
their
occupation
and
the
enjoyment
they
got
out
of
it
there
was
no
noise
all
conversed
in
subdued
whispers
and
behaved
in
the
most
gentle
manner
to
each
other
especially
to
the
smallest
and
there
were
many
of
them
so
small
that
they
could
only
toddle
about
by
the
most
judicious
exercise
of
their
equilibrium
i
do
not
say
this
by
way
of
reproof
to
any
other
kind
of
children
these
little
groups
as
i
have
said
were
scattered
all
about
the
church
and
they
made
with
their
tapers
little
spots
of
light
which
looked
in
the
distance
very
much
like
correggio
picture
which
is
at
dresden
the
holy
family
at
night
and
the
light
from
the
divine
child
blazing
in
the
faces
of
all
the
attendants
some
of
the
children
were
infants
in
the
nurses
arms
but
no
one
was
too
small
to
have
a
taper
and
to
run
the
risk
of
burning
its
fingers
there
is
nothing
that
a
baby
likes
more
than
a
lighted
candle
and
the
church
has
understood
this
longing
in
human
nature
and
found
means
to
gratify
it
by
this
festival
of
tapers
the
groups
do
not
all
remain
long
in
place
you
may
imagine
there
is
a
good
deal
of
shifting
about
and
i
see
little
stragglers
wandering
over
the
church
like
fairies
lighted
by
fireflies
occasionally
they
form
a
little
procession
and
march
from
one
altar
to
another
their
lights
twinkling
as
they
go
but
all
this
time
there
is
music
pouring
out
of
the
at
the
end
of
the
church
and
flooding
all
its
spaces
with
its
volume
in
front
of
the
organ
is
a
choir
of
boys
led
by
a
and
jolly
monk
who
rolls
about
as
he
sings
and
lets
the
deep
bass
noise
rumble
about
a
long
time
in
his
stomach
before
he
pours
it
out
of
his
mouth
i
can
see
the
faces
of
all
of
them
quite
well
for
each
singer
has
a
candle
to
light
his
and
next
to
the
monk
stands
the
boy
the
handsomest
boy
in
the
whole
world
probably
at
this
moment
i
can
see
now
his
great
liquid
dark
eyes
and
his
exquisite
face
and
the
way
he
tossed
back
his
long
waving
hair
when
he
struck
into
his
part
he
resembled
the
portraits
of
raphael
when
that
artist
was
a
boy
only
i
think
he
looked
better
than
raphael
and
without
trying
for
he
seemed
to
be
a
spontaneous
sort
of
boy
and
how
that
boy
did
sing
he
was
the
soprano
of
the
choir
and
he
had
a
voice
of
heavenly
sweetness
when
he
opened
his
mouth
and
tossed
back
his
head
he
filled
the
church
with
exquisite
melody
he
sang
like
a
lark
or
like
an
angel
as
we
never
heard
an
angel
sing
that
comparison
is
not
worth
much
i
have
seen
pictures
of
angels
singing
there
is
one
by
jan
and
hubert
van
eyck
in
the
gallery
at
berlin
and
they
open
their
mouths
like
this
boy
but
i
ca
say
as
much
for
their
singing
the
lark
which
you
very
likely
never
heard
either
for
larks
are
as
scarce
in
america
as
angels
is
a
bird
that
springs
up
from
the
meadow
and
begins
to
sing
as
he
rises
in
a
spiral
flight
and
the
higher
he
mounts
the
sweeter
he
sings
until
you
think
the
notes
are
dropping
out
of
heaven
itself
and
you
hear
him
when
he
is
gone
from
sight
and
you
think
you
hear
him
long
after
all
sound
has
ceased
and
yet
this
boy
sang
better
than
a
lark
because
he
had
more
notes
and
a
greater
compass
and
more
volume
although
he
shook
out
his
voice
in
the
same
gleesome
abundance
i
am
sorry
that
i
can
not
add
that
this
ravishingly
beautiful
boy
was
a
good
boy
he
was
probably
one
of
the
most
mischievous
boys
that
was
ever
in
an
all
the
time
that
he
was
singing
the
vespers
he
was
skylarking
like
an
imp
while
he
was
pouring
out
the
most
divine
melody
he
would
take
the
opportunity
of
kicking
the
shins
of
the
boy
next
to
him
and
while
he
was
waiting
for
his
part
he
would
kick
out
behind
at
any
one
who
was
incautious
enough
to
approach
him
there
never
was
such
a
vicious
boy
he
kept
the
whole
loft
in
a
ferment
when
the
monk
rumbled
his
bass
in
his
stomach
the
boy
cut
up
that
set
every
other
boy
into
a
laugh
or
he
stirred
up
a
row
that
set
them
all
at
fisticuffs
and
yet
this
boy
was
a
great
favorite
the
jolly
monk
loved
him
best
of
all
and
bore
with
his
wildest
pranks
when
he
was
wanted
to
sing
his
part
and
was
skylarking
in
the
rear
the
fat
monk
took
him
by
the
ear
and
brought
him
forward
and
when
he
gave
the
boy
ear
a
twist
the
boy
opened
his
lovely
mouth
and
poured
forth
such
a
flood
of
melody
as
you
never
heard
and
he
did
mind
his
notes
he
seemed
to
know
his
notes
by
heart
and
could
sing
and
look
off
like
a
nightingale
on
a
bough
he
knew
his
power
that
boy
and
he
stepped
forward
to
his
stand
when
he
pleased
certain
that
he
would
be
forgiven
as
soon
as
he
began
to
sing
and
such
spirit
and
life
as
he
threw
into
the
performance
rollicking
through
the
vespers
with
a
perfect
abandon
of
carriage
as
if
he
could
sing
himself
out
of
his
skin
if
he
liked
while
the
little
angels
down
below
were
pattering
about
with
their
wax
tapers
keeping
the
holy
fire
burning
suddenly
the
organ
stopped
the
monk
shut
his
book
with
a
bang
the
boys
blew
out
the
candles
and
i
heard
them
all
tumbling
in
a
gale
of
noise
and
laughter
the
beautiful
boy
i
saw
no
more
about
him
plays
the
light
of
tender
memory
but
were
he
twice
as
lovely
i
could
never
think
of
him
as
having
either
the
simple
manliness
or
the
good
fortune
of
the
new
england
boy
