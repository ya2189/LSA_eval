eighth
edition
carefully
revised
preface
in
again
presenting
this
volume
to
the
world
i
trust
i
feel
thankful
to
god
for
the
favour
with
which
the
infant
system
has
been
received
and
for
all
the
aid
i
have
enjoyed
in
my
course
of
labour
had
the
measures
i
originated
for
the
development
of
the
infant
mind
and
the
improvement
of
the
moral
character
been
sanctioned
at
first
as
many
now
think
they
should
have
been
their
progress
would
undoubtedly
have
been
far
greater
but
when
i
consider
what
has
been
accomplished
under
the
divine
benediction
and
amid
greater
difficulties
than
ever
beset
the
path
of
an
individual
similarly
occupied
i
know
not
how
to
express
the
gratitude
of
which
i
am
conscious
it
seems
proper
and
even
necessary
to
remark
that
the
system
explained
in
this
volume
is
the
result
of
many
years
of
labour
thousands
of
children
have
been
attentively
observed
and
for
the
necessities
that
arose
in
their
instruction
provision
has
been
made
others
have
doubtless
reached
some
of
the
conclusions
at
which
i
have
arrived
but
this
is
only
another
instance
of
the
coincidence
in
judgment
and
effort
often
discoverable
in
persons
far
apart
whose
attention
has
been
directed
to
similiar
subjects
but
with
the
exception
of
the
elliptical
plan
devised
by
gilchrist
i
am
not
aware
that
i
owe
an
idea
or
contrivance
to
any
individual
whatever
upwards
of
thousand
children
have
been
now
under
my
own
care
in
various
parts
of
the
united
kingdom
whose
age
has
not
exceeded
six
years
myself
my
daughters
and
my
agents
have
organized
many
score
of
schools
and
thus
i
have
had
opportunities
of
studying
the
infant
mind
and
heart
such
as
none
of
my
contemporaries
have
ever
possessed
still
i
am
aware
i
have
much
to
learn
i
am
far
less
satisfied
with
the
extent
of
my
knowledge
and
far
less
confident
of
its
perfection
and
completeness
now
than
i
was
in
the
earlier
part
of
my
course
the
whole
energies
of
my
mind
however
having
been
thrown
upon
the
subject
and
the
whole
of
my
time
for
the
third
of
a
century
having
been
zealously
devoted
to
it
i
trust
the
volume
will
contain
knowledge
of
a
more
plain
simple
and
practical
character
than
is
elsewhere
to
be
found
perhaps
it
may
not
be
presumption
to
say
than
elsewhere
be
found
should
i
have
the
pleasure
to
labour
for
years
to
come
i
trust
i
shall
have
much
more
to
communicate
on
the
subject
two
editions
of
this
work
in
its
former
state
have
been
printed
in
german
and
it
has
also
been
reprinted
in
america
i
have
however
felt
it
due
to
the
friends
of
education
to
make
this
volume
as
complete
as
possible
and
though
still
occasionally
engaged
in
superintending
and
organizing
schools
i
have
felt
it
necessary
to
revise
this
eighth
edition
very
carefully
throughout
and
commence
it
with
a
new
and
additional
chapter
cottage

common
wakefield
a
few
testimonials
to
the
infant
system
it
is
said
that
we
are
aiming
at
carrying
education
too
far
that
we
are
drawing
it
out
to
an
extravagant
length
and
that
not
satisfied
with
dispensing
education
to
children
also
have
attained
what
in
former
times
was
thought
a
proper
age
we
are
now
anxious
to
educate
mere
infants
incapable
of
receiving
benefit
from
such
instruction
this
objection
may
be
answered
in
two
ways
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
observed
that
the
objection
comes
from
those
very
persons
who
object
to
education
being
given
to
children
when
they
arrive
at
a
more
advanced
period
on
the
ground
that
their
parents
then
begin
to
find
them
useful
in
labour
and
consequently
can
not
spare
so
much
of
their
time
as
might
be
requisite
surely
that
the
education
of
the
children
should
commence
at
that
time
when
their
labour
can
be
of
value
to
their
parents
but
the
other
answer
in
my
opinion
is
still
more
decisive
it
is
found
even
at
the
early
age
of
seven
or
eight
that
children
are
not
void
of
those
propensities
which
are
the
forerunners
of
vice
and
i
can
give
no
better
illustration
of
this
than
the
fact
of
a
child
only
eight
years
old
being
convicted
of
a
capital
offence
at
our
tribunals
of
justice
when
therefore
i
find
that
at
this
early
period
of
life
these
habits
of
vice
are
formed
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
begin
still
earlier
to
store
their
minds
with
such
tastes
and
to
instruct
them
in
such
a
manner
as
to
exclude
the
admission
of
those
practises
that
lead
to
such
early
crime
and
depravity
a
noble
friend
has
most
justly
stated
that
it
is
not
with
the
experiences
of
yesterday
that
we
come
armed
to
the
contest
it
is
not
a
speculation
that
we
are
bringing
forward
to
your
notice
but
an
experiment
lord
in
leaving
poor
children
to
the
care
of
their
parents
neglect
is
the
least
that
happens
it
too
frequently
occurs
that
they
are
turned
over
to
delegates
where
they
meet
with
the
worst
treatment
so
that
we
do
not
in
fact
come
so
much
into
contact
with
the
parents
themselves
as
with
those
delegates
who
are
so
utterly
unfit
for
the
office
they
undertake
infant
schools
however
have
completely
succeeded
not
only
in
the
negative
plan
they
had
in
view
of
keeping
the
children
out
of
vice
and
mischief
but
even
to
the
extent
of
engrafting
in
their
minds
at
an
early
age
those
principles
of
virtue
which
capacitated
them
for
receiving
a
further
stage
of
instruction
at
a
more
advanced
school
and
finally
as
they
approached
manhood
to
be
ripened
into
the
noblest
sentiments
of
probity
and
integrity
marquis
of
i
am
a
zealous
friend
upon
conviction
to
infant
schools
for
the
children
of
the
poor
no
person
who
has
not
himself
watched
them
can
form
an
adequate
action
of
what
these
institutions
when
judiciously
conducted
may
effect
in
forming
the
tempers
and
habits
of
young
children
in
giving
them
not
so
much
actual
knowledge
as
that
which
at
their
age
is
more
important
the
habit
and
faculty
of
acquiring
it
and
it
correcting
those
moral
defects
which
neglect
or
injudicious
treatment
would
soon
confirm
and
render
incurable
the
early
age
at
which
children
are
taken
out
of
our
national
schools
is
an
additional
reason
for
commencing
a
regular
and
systematic
discipline
of
their
minds
and
wills
as
soon
as
they
are
capable
of
profiting
by
it
and
that
is
at
the
very
earliest
opening
of
the
understanding
and
at
the
first
manifestation
of
a
corrupt
nature
in
the
shape
of
a
childish
petulance
and
waywardness
bishop
of
the
claims
of
this
institution
were
of
such
a
nature
that
they
required
no
recommendation
but
a
full
statement
of
them
the
foundation
of
its
happy
results
had
been
pointed
out
to
exist
in
the
principles
of
policy
and
of
religion
paramount
to
all
policy
a
religion
that
appealed
to
every
feeling
of
human
nature
he
would
recommend
this
charity
as
one
less
attended
with
perplexity
in
its
operations
or
doubt
as
to
its
utility
than
many
which
though
established
with
the
best
possible
motives
frequently
failed
in
effecting
the
good
proposed
but
in
this
the
most
acute
opponent
could
not
discover
any
mischief
that
would
arise
from
its
success
james
i
have
always
thought
that
that
man
that
would
be
the
greatest
benefactor
to
his
country
who
did
most
for
the
suppression
of
crime
this
i
am
sorry
to
say
our
legislature
have
neglected
in
a
great
degree
while
they
have
readily
employed
themselves
in
providing
for
its
punishment
those
acquainted
with
our
prisons
must
know
that
those
found
to
have
sunk
deepest
into
vice
and
crime
were
persons
who
had
never
received
any
education
moral
or
religious
in
the
refuge
for
the
destitute
an
exact
account
was
kept
and
it
was
found
that
of
the
great
mass
of
culprits
sent
there
by
the
magistrates
on
account
of
their
youth
were
the
children
of
parents
who
had
no
opportunity
of
educating
them
by
this
institution
they
would
at
once
promote
virtue
and
prevent
the
real
fact
is
that
the
character
of
all
mankind
is
formed
very
early
much
earlier
than
might
be
supposed
at
the
age
of
two
or
three
years
dispositions
were
found
in
children
of
a
description
the
most
objectionable
in
these
schools
the
principles
of
mutual
kindness
and
assistance
were
carried
as
far
as
could
well
be
conceived
and
it
was
most
delightful
to
regard
the
conduct
of
the
children
towards
each
other
instead
of
opposition
they
displayed
mutual
inculcated
to
the
greatest
degree
so
as
to
destroy
in
the
minds
of
the
children
that
selfishness
which
was
the
bane
of
our
nature
such
effects
appeared
almost
to
realize
the
golden
age
for
the
children
appeared
always
happy
and
never
so
happy
as
when
attending
the
smith
esq
i
feel
having
witnessed
the
happy
effects
produced
by
these
schools
a
warm
zeal
in
support
of
such
institutions
we
can
not
begin
too
soon
to
impress
religions
principles
on
the
minds
of
the
young
it
is
an
affecting
consideration
that
while
great
statesmen
have
been
busied
in
their
closets
on
some
fine
scheme
or
speculation
they
have
neglected
these
salutary
principles
which
the
almighty
has
given
to
mankind
it
is
remarkable
how
eagerly
the
young
mind
receives
the
histories
of
the
bible
and
how
well
they
are
fitted
to
work
on
their
dispositions
and
when
i
consider
the
miserable
state
of
the
poor
i
can
not
but
feel
that
the
rich
are
in
some
degree
the
authors
of
it
in
having
neglected
to
afford
them
the
means
of
wilberforce
i
am
much
delighted
with
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
i
confess
i
entertained
doubts
of
the
practicability
of
the
infant
school
system
but
these
doubts
have
this
day
been
removed
if
in
so
much
can
be
done
what
might
not
be
expected
from
further
training
i
now
doubt
no
longer
and
anticipate
from
the
extension
of
such
schools
a
vast
improvement
in
the
morals
and
religion
of
the
humble
classes
i
conclude
with
moving
a
vote
of
thanks
to
mr
wilderspin
chief
justice
sir
john
sinclair
rose
and
in
addressing
wilderspin
said
that
he
was
astonished
with
the
results
of
five
weeks
training
in
these
perfect
infants
he
had
never
seen
a
greater
prodigy
he
too
had
had
his
prejudices
his
doubts
of
the
possibility
of
infant
education
but
these
doubts
had
now
vanished
and
for
ever
the
arrangements
for
bodily
exercise
connected
with
mental
and
moral
improvement
especially
delighted
him
he
was
amused
as
well
as
instructed
by
the
admixture
of
diverting
expedients
to
keep
the
children
alive
and
alert
it
was
mixta
jocis
but
there
was
practical
sense
in
the
seemingly
most
frivolous
part
of
the
plan
he
trusted
that
the
time
was
not
far
distant
when
there
should
be
many
such
institutions
he
called
on
all
present
to
join
him
in
returning
cordial
thanks
to
mr
the
grand
secret
of
the
improvement
found
to
be
derived
from
these
establishments
is
their
constant
tendency
to
remove
evil
example
and
misery
from
the
little
creatures
during
almost
the
whole
of
their
waking
hours
consider
how
a
child
belonging
to
one
of
these
passes
his
day
as
soon
as
he
is
up
the
indispensable
condition
and
the
only
one
of
his
admission
to
the
school
that
of
clean
face
and
hands
is
enforced
and
the
mother
in
order
to
be
relieved
of
the
care
of
him
during
the
day
is
obliged
to
have
him
washed
he
then
leaves
the
abode
of
filth
and
intemperance
and
squalid
poverty
and
for
a
clean
airy
place
pleasant
in
summer
warm
and
dry
in
winter
and
where
he
sees
not
a
face
that
is
not
lighted
up
with
the
smile
of
kindness
towards
him
his
whole
day
is
passed
in
amusing
exercises
or
interesting
instruction
and
he
returns
at
fatigued
and
ready
for
his
bed
so
that
the
scenes
passing
at
his
comfortless
home
make
a
slight
impression

his

i
how
came
you
to
think
of
the
infant
school
system
of
teaching
is
a
question
that
i
have
often
been
asked
and
my
friends
think
it
advisable
that
it
should
in
part
at
least
be
answered
i
proceed
therefore
in
compliance
with
their
wishes
to
give
some
little
of
the
required
information
in
this
place
as
perhaps
it
may
throw
light
upon
or
explain
more
clearly
the
fundamental
principles
laid
down
and
advocated
throughout
this
volume
in
few
words
then
i
would
reply
forced
me
to
it
born
an
only
child
under
peculiar
circumstances
and
living
in
an
isolated
neighbourhood
i
had
no
childish
companions
from
infancy
i
was
consequently
thrown
much
on
my
own
resources
and
early
became
a
and
in
some
measure
a
contriver
too
i
beheld
a
beautiful
world
around
me
full
of
everything
to
admire
and
to
win
attention
as
soon
as
i
could
think
at
all
i
saw
that
there
must
be
a
maker
governor
and
protector
of
this
world
such
things
as
had
life
won
my
admiration
and
thus
i
became
very
fond
of
animals
flowers
and
fruits
stones
and
minerals
i
also
soon
learned
to
observe
and
to
mark
their
differences
this
led
to
enquiries
as
to
how
they
came
where
from
who
made
them
my
mother
told
me
they
came
from
god
that
he
made
them
and
all
things
that
i
saw
and
also
that
he
made
herself
and
me
from
that
moment
i
never
doubted
his
wonderful
existence
i
could
not
nor
did
i
have
at
that
age
any
correct
idea
of
god
but
i
soon
learned
to
have
elevated
notions
of
his
works
and
through
them
i
was
led
to
adore
something
invisible
something
i
was
convinced
of
within
but
could
not
see
my
mother
to
my
knowledge
never
deceived
me
or
told
me
an
untruth
therefore
i
believed
her
implicitly
and
to
this
day
i
never
doubted
so
much
for
the
implanting
an
early
in
the
unseen
but
the
beautiful
world
and
the
things
in
it
which
i
saw
and
with
which
i
came
in
contact
oh
how
wonderful
they
appeared
to
me
they
were
my
companions
other
children
were
strange
to
me
and
they
were
not
nigh
either
to
help
or
to
thwart
me
my
mother
was
my
oracle
during
the
first
six
years
of
childhood
resolving
my
difficulties
and
answering
my
questions
i
was
happy
very
happy
and
still
look
back
to
those
days
with
indescribable
pleasure
and
satisfaction
i
had
no
tasks
i
was
not
pestered
with
nor
eb
from
my
parents
chiefly
taught
me
my
first
lessons
and
they
have
been
as
durable
as
life
for
days
and
weeks
did
i
study
such
lessons
my
parents
waited
till
i
asked
for
information
and
when
it
was
required
it
was
never
denied
the
world
and
the
wonders
in
it
formed
as
it
were
a
heaven
to
me
i
am
told
i
gave
but
little
trouble
at
this
age
in
the
beautiful
fields
and
wild
coppices
about
hornsey
as
yet
unencroached
upon
by
suburban
extension
and
by
the
side
of
the
then
solitary
banks
of
the
new
river
i
was
always
to
be
found
in
cold
and
wet
weather
i
had
a
stock
of
similar
lessons
in
my
home
small
live
animals
were
my
constant
companions
they
taught
me
that
love
begets
love
i
did
love
and
delight
in
them
and
when
they
died
i
mourned
their
loss
every
day
brought
me
new
information
which
my
parents
perfected
at
length
the
alphabet
was
mastered
and
afterwards
spelling
reading
and
so
forth
my
mind
thus
previously
filled
with
the
acquirement
of
words
and
abstract
terms
became
less
irksome
and
i
can
not
remember
that
thus
far
it
cost
me
any
trouble
much
less
pain
information
of
every
kind
fit
for
childhood
then
really
gave
me
pleasure
no
doubt
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
my
parents
for
their
judicious
management
my
father
always
in
the
evening
took
great
pains
to
explain
things
to
me
he
nurtured
but
never
crammed
he
knew
when
to
teach
and
when
to
let
alone
unfortunately
through
very
peculiar
circumstances
i
was
removed
from
the
immediate
care
and
superintendence
of
both
parents
rather
early
in
life
and
at
an
age
the
most
dangerous
was
left
to
grapple
nearly
alone
with
the
wide
world
and
the
beings
in
it
with
little
of
either
parental
guidance
it
was
then
i
saw
the
immense
importance
and
advantage
of
early
impressions
to
me
they
were
of
incalculable
benefit
and
no
doubt
led
when
i
became
a
man
to
the
thoughts
which
ended
in
the
development
and
practical
working
of
the
infant
system
and
method
of
education
schools
for
infants
then
existed
but
what
were
they
simply
with
the
hornbook
for
boys
and
girls
and
perhaps
a
little
sewing
for
the
latter
their
sign
was
children
taught
to
read
and
work
here
and
their
furniture
the
cap
and
bells
the
rod
in
pickle
and
a
corner
for
dunces
the
finishing
stroke
was
seen
in
the
parlour
of
the
inn
or
the
in
the
shape
of
needlework
as
a
samplar
lydia
languish
her
work
done
at
school
in
the
year
of
our
lord
such
were
the
schools
in
country
places
then
in
existence
the
little
ones
doing
nothing
in
i
thought
a
remedy
was
required
and
might
be
found
and
therefore
set
about
working
it
out
how
it
was
done
shall
be
hereafter
explained
i
knew
my
own
infant
state
had
been
a
happy
one
and
i
wondered
to
see
children
crying
to
go
to
school
when
learning
had
been
such
a
delight
to
me
but
i
soon
ceased
to
wonder
when
i
was
sent
there
myself
at
my
first
school
i
can
truly
say
i
learnt
nothing
except
it
be
that
i
had
especially
the
sense
of
feeling
i
often
had
raps
with
the
cane
on
the
head
across
the
shoulders
and
on
the
hand
and
i
found
it
was
mainly
for
not
learning
what
the
teacher
had
to
teach
the
terms
used
were
master
and
mistress
and
they
were
tolerably
appropriate
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
for
to
me
both
became
objects
of
terror
so
much
so
that
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
really
fretted
when
the
hour
of
teaching
came
my
parents
were
not
long
in
perceiving
this
although
i
did
not
complain
they
told
me
it
was
for
my
good
that
i
should
go
to
school
and
i
thoroughly
believed
them
yet
i
could
not
understand
why
it
should
be
associated
with
so
much
dislike
and
pain
on
my
part
when
my
first
school
the
beautiful
world
of
nature
had
been
so
lovely
and
my
first
teachers
had
always
increased
the
delight
by
removing
my
difficulties
and
this
so
much
so
that
i
now
longed
for
evening
to
come
to
have
fresh
light
and
instruction
given
my
father
now
decided
that
i
should
not
go
to
school
and
he
became
my
teacher
as
before
the
world
being
my
great
book
i
was
delighted
with
robinson
crusoe
and
this
work
became
my
companion
and
to
which
was
added
the
pilgrim
progress
after
these
my
great
favourite
was
buffon
natural
history
i
used
to
go
alone
taking
a
volume
at
a
time
to
read
amidst
the
pleasant
country
around
but
most
frequently
in
the
quiet
nooks
and
retreats
of
hornsey
wood
it
seems
however
that
i
was
always
watched
and
superintended
by
my
mother
during
these
readings
and
rural
rambles
for
whenever
danger
was
near
she
generally
appeared
but
seldom
otherwise
so
that
i
had
perfect
freedom
in
these
matters
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
first
seven
years
of
my
life
laid
the
basis
of
all
i
know
that
is
worth
knowing
and
led
to
the
formation
of
my
character
and
future
career
in
life
of
my
schooling
afterwards
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
much
as
it
was
the
usual
routine
such
as
others
had
but
it
never
satisfied
me
and
i
even
then
saw
errors
throughout
the
whole
and
this
strengthened
my
first
impressions
and
tended
to
mature
the
in
me
that
something
wanted
doing
and
be
it
is
not
my
intention
in
this
introductory
chapter
to
write
an
but
my
object
is
simply
to
show
how
one
impression
followed
another
in
my
case
and
what
led
to
it
to
point
out
briefly
the
various
plans
and
inventions
i
had
recourse
to
in
carrying
out
my
views
and
intentions
and
finally
to
allude
to
their
propagation
through
the
country
personally
by
myself
on
purpose
to
show
in
conclusion
that
although
infant
education
has
been
extensively
adopted
and
many
of
its
principles
being
based
on
nature
have
been
applied
with
great
success
to
older
children
yet
especially
in
the
case
of
infants
that
strict
adherence
to
nature
and
simplicity
which
is
so
fundamental
and
so
requisite
has
been
often
overlooked
and
in
some
cases
totally
discarded
it
will
i
trust
appear
from
what
has
been
already
said
that
even
from
early
childhood
i
both
saw
and
felt
that
there
was
a
period
in
human
life
and
that
the
most
important
period
as
experience
has
proved
to
my
full
satisfaction
not
legislated
for
that
is
not
duly
provided
with
suitable
and
appropriate
methods
of
education
to
see
this
was
one
thing
to
provide
a
remedy
for
it
and
to
for
carrying
out
that
remedy
was
another
the
systems
of
bell
and
of
lancaster
were
then
commencing
operations
but
were
quite
unsuitable
for
children
under
seven
years
of
age
at
least
and
therefore
took
little
or
no
cognizance
of
that
early
period
which
i
had
been
inwardly
convinced
was
of
such
eminent
importance
i
was
destined
for
business
and
served
the
usual
apprenticeship
to
become
qualified
for
it
and
also
continued
in
it
for
a
short
period
on
my
own
account
even
at
this
time
the
thought
ever
haunted
me
as
to
what
should
be
done
for
young
children
at
length
the
germ
was
developed
at
one
of
the
sunday
schools
which
were
then
rising
into
general
notice
for
years
i
attended
one
of
these
in
london
and
here
circumstances
again
befriended
me
regarding
the
matter
so
frequently
in
my
thoughts
the
teachers
mostly
preferred
having
a
class
to
superintend
that
knew
something
and
i
being
then
a
junior
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
have
a
class
that
knew
little
or
nothing
i
mean
nothing
that
it
was
the
object
of
the
to
teach
it
soon
appeared
clear
to
me
that
such
a
class
required
different
treatment
to
those
more
advanced
and
especially
the
children
nobody
wanted
this
class
it
was
always
to
let
if
i
did
not
take
it
the
result
was
i
always
had
it
others
looked
to
the
post
of
honour
the
i
soon
found
that
to
talk
to
such
children
as
i
had
to
teach
in
the
manner
the
others
did
to
the
older
and
more
advanced
children
was
useless
and
thus
i
was
forced
to
simplify
my
mode
of
teaching
to
suit
their
state
of
apprehension
and
now
and
then
even
to
amuse
them
this
succeeded
so
well
that
in
the
end
my
class
became
the
popular
class
and
i
became
still
further
convinced
of
the
desirableness
of
an
plan
for
teaching
the
very
i
however
still
thought
that
the
alphabet
should
be
taught
first
with
the
usual
things
in
their
order
at
length
shortly
after
my
marriage
which
was
rather
early
in
life
an
opportunity
presented
itself
for
trying
an
experiment
on
a
larger
scale
from
having
explained
my
views
on
early
education
to
a
friend
i
was
solicited
to
take
the
superintendence
of
an
asylum
for
young
children
about
to
be
formed
in
a
populous
part
of
london
having
thus
an
opportunity
of
carrying
out
my
wishes
thoughts
and
feelings
in
a
way
that
i
could
not
have
anticipated
i
gave
up
my
connexion
with
business
and
devoted
myself
to
the
object
great
and
unforseen
difficulties
however
had
to
be
encountered
the
first
week
was
dreadful
i
began
with
too
many
children
and
we
had
six
whom
the
mothers
afterwards
confessed
they
sent
to
these
not
only
cried
themselves
but
set
all
the
others
crying
also
and
we
regretted
having
begun
the
experiment
at
length
driven
almost
to
despair
it
became
evident
that
something
new
must
be
done
to
still
the
tumult
as
an
expedient
i
elevated
a
cap
on
a
pole
which
immediately
attracted
their
attention
and
occasioned
silence
thus
i
obtained
a
clue
to
guide
me
and
my
mind
instantly
perceived
one
of
the
most
fundamental
principles
in
infant
teaching
in
fact
of
most
teaching
and
which
long
experience
has
proved
true
and
that
is
to
appeal
to
the
senses
of
the
children
after
this
every
day
developed
something
new
to
me
the
children
became
happy
beyond
my
expectations
and
my
course
onward
was
gradually
progressive
children
and
teachers
became
happy
together
difficulties
vanished
as
we
proceeded
and
at
length
my
wife
and
i
made
up
our
minds
to
devote
our
whole
lives
to
the
perfecting
of
our
plans
and
the
carrying
them
out
extensively
the
novelty
of
the
thing
drew
numbers
of
visitors
to
a
district
where
the
carriages
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
had
not
been
seen
before
but
the
labour
to
us
was
so
greatly
increased
by
this
that
my
wife
sunk
under
it
and
i
was
left
with
four
young
children
to
prosecute
my
plans
alone
in
the
world
from
the
day
i
caught
the
idea
that
a
great
secret
in
teaching
the
young
was
to
teach
through
the
the
various
implements
now
in
such
general
use
in
infant
schools
were
step
by
step
invented
by
me
objects
of
all
kinds
were
introduced
and
oral
lessons
given
upon
them
to
teach
their
qualities
and
properties
and
amongst
the
various
visitors
most
frequently
present
at
such
times
was
the
gentleman
who
has
acquired
fame
by
publishing
lessons
on
objects
which
little
work
has
elsewhere
been
highly
commended
by
me
albeit
it
came
forth
into
the
world
several
years
after
the
period
i
now
speak
of
to
give
such
lessons
i
found
it
requisite
to
have
the
children
altogether
so
as
better
to
attract
their
attention
simultaneously
this
was
first
attempted
by
placing
them
at
one
end
of
the
room
but
it
was
found
inconvenient
then
parallel
lines
were
chalked
across
the
floor
and
they
sat
down
in
order
on
these
but
though
attention
was
gained
the
posture
was
unsuitable
cords
were
then
stretched
across
to
keep
them
in
proper
rank
and
various
experiments
tried
with
seats
until
they
ended
in
the
construction
of
a
permanently
fixed
gallery
of
regularly
ascending
seats
this
implement
or
structure
has
now
come
into
almost
universal
use
in
infant
schools
and
in
fact
they
are
considered
incomplete
without
one
and
also
they
are
in
much
request
in
schools
for
children
of
every
age
to
give
an
idea
of
number
through
the
eye
i
had
recourse
at
first
to
buttons
strung
on
strings
across
a
frame
and
this
led
to
the
substitution
of
wooden
balls
on
wires
and
other
improvements
through
experience
until
the
arithmeticon
hereafter
described
was
fully
formed
it
having
been
found
a
useful
instrument
the
credit
of
contriving
it
has
been
impugned
by
liking
it
to
the
roman
abacus
and
chinese
swanpan
but
were
those
instruments
like
in
structure
or
designed
especially
to
teach
the
multiplication
table
if
not
they
are
no
more
similar
than
a
hawk
to
a
the
former
i
have
never
seen
and
the
first
time
i
saw
one
of
the
chinese
instruments
was
some
five
or
six
years
ago
in
the
museum
at
hull
the
clapping
of
hands
the
moving
of
arms
marching
in
order
and
various
other
motions
all
of
which
are
now
become
the
especial
characteristics
of
an
were
gradually
introduced
as
circumstances
or
nature
dictated
partly
to
obtain
simultaneous
action
and
obedience
and
partly
to
provide
that
physical
exercise
which
beings
so
young
perpetually
require
and
which
they
are
constantly
taking
when
left
free
and
unrestrained
it
is
not
requisite
to
make
mention
here
of
the
swing
the
play
grounds
the
flower
borders
and
various
other
matters
which
are
fully
treated
of
in
the
following
portions
of
this
work
further
than
to
add
that
they
are
now
generally
adopted
in
schools
and
especially
in
some
of
the
principal
training
establishments
in
the
british
empire
as
these
plans
and
instruments
are
used
by
a
certain
religious
society
which
professes
to
have
imported
its
system
from
switzerland
where
such
things
never
had
their
origin
i
feel
it
necessary
most
emphatically
to
repeat
that
they
are
entirely
of
my
own
invention
after
the
severe
bereavement
mentioned
above
i
still
persevered
in
my
favourite
study
and
learned
more
from
my
own
children
than
i
did
before
having
to
act
in
the
double
capacity
of
father
and
mother
i
am
well
aware
of
the
loss
my
children
sustained
by
the
above
calamity
in
the
matter
of
training
nothing
can
replace
a
good
mother
and
such
indeed
she
eminently
was
i
felt
the
heavy
stroke
more
severely
and
my
children
did
also
but
i
consoled
myself
with
the
reflection
that
my
loss
was
her
gain
and
that
she
had
lived
to
witness
fruits
of
her
unparalleled
labours
to
the
thorough
abandonment
of
self
and
the
glory
of
her
maker
inasmuch
as
ye
have
done
it
unto
one
of
these
little
ones
ye
have
done
it
unto
me
night
and
day
when
i
had
time
to
think
such
promises
as
these
cheered
and
sustained
me
in
doing
what
i
could
for
my
own
motherless
children
and
more
and
more
cemented
my
affections
on
the
children
of
others
and
finally
enabled
me
to
mature
my
plans
and
gave
me
strength
and
courage
to
carry
them
out
first
in
the
villages
and
places
near
london
and
ultimately
and
alone
through
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
many
of
the
chief
cities
towns
and
villages
of
the
united
kingdom
simply
to
state
this
fact
is
all
that
is
requisite
here
to
answer
my
present
purpose
and
to
enlarge
more
upon
it
is
needless
as
a
full
detail
of
the
whole
career
is
given
in
my
early
discipline
illustrated
or
the
infant
system
progressing
and
successful
third
edition
published
in
and
to
which
much
more
would
require
adding
to
bring
it
down
to
the
present
time
if
a
further
edition
should
be
called
for
that
prejudice
should
assail
me
and
objections
be
started
as
i
came
more
out
into
the
world
was
to
be
expected
i
knew
my
own
intentions
but
the
world
did
not
and
i
came
in
for
a
full
share
of
obloquy
and
persecution
this
did
me
much
good
and
was
a
preparatory
discipline
to
make
me
careless
of
the
opinion
of
mankind
in
the
matter
so
long
as
i
felt
that
i
was
in
the
right
and
had
the
approval
of
my
own
conscience
the
more
i
was
opposed
the
more
were
my
energies
lighted
up
and
strengthened
opposition
always
sharpened
my
faculties
instead
of
overcoming
and
depressing
me
the
whole
gradually
prospered
from
the
first
under
every
disadvantage
and
notwithstanding
the
strenuous
efforts
of
the
and
bigoted
these
things
laid
my
first
patrons
prostrate
and
the
society
of
great
names
which
followed
was
soon
dissolved
every
effort
was
made
by
the
enemies
of
true
training
and
education
to
crush
the
thing
in
the
bud
and
not
only
the
thing
but
also
the
man
who
developed
it
and
worked
it
out
thank
god
these
inimical
aims
did
not
succeed
though
worldly
patrons
failed
i
had
one
patron
who
never
deserted
me
but
who
upheld
and
encouraged
me
from
first
to
last
until
the
end
was
gained
not
however
all
that
was
aimed
at
but
much
of
it
and
the
rest
will
follow
or
i
am
greatly
mistaken
i
have
in
various
places
seen
things
that
i
earnestly
contended
for
but
which
were
rejected
at
the
time
at
length
established
and
their
value
seen
look
at
the
schools
in
existence
now
bad
as
some
of
them
are
and
compare
them
with
those
which
existed
a
third
of
a
century
ago
and
it
will
be
found
that
they
have
progressed
and
it
may
safely
be
anticipated
that
they
will
still
further
progress
for
there
is
much
need
of
it
the
system
pourtrayed
in
this
book
is
intended
to
act
on
all
the
faculties
of
a
child
especially
the
highest
and
to
strengthen
them
at
the
time
the
mere
animal
part
of
his
nature
is
weak
the
existing
schools
were
not
found
fit
to
take
our
children
when
they
left
us
the
dull
monotonous
sleepy
heavy
system
pursued
was
quite
unadapted
to
advance
such
pupils
at
this
point
of
the
history
much
damage
was
done
to
our
plans
the
essence
or
kernel
was
omitted
and
the
mere
shell
retained
to
make
infant
schools
harmonise
with
the
existing
ones
instead
of
the
contrary
there
were
and
are
however
two
great
exceptions
to
this
rule
the
model
schools
at
dublin
under
the
government
board
of
education
and
the
glasgow
training
schools
for
scotland
at
dublin
all
is
progression
the
infant
department
is
the
best
in
europe
i
believe
the
best
in
the
world
the
other
departments
are
equally
good
in
most
things
and
are
well
managed
as
far
as
regards
a
good
secular
education
being
given
and
better
i
think
than
any
similar
institution
in
england
at
glasgow
the
same
master
whom
i
taught
still
exists
i
have
not
seen
the
schools
for
many
years
but
i
hear
from
those
who
have
been
trained
there
that
nothing
can
work
better
the
glasgow
committee
with
stow
at
their
head
deserve
the
thanks
of
the
whole
community
for
having
applied
the
principles
on
which
the
infant
school
system
is
based
to
juveniles
and
carried
out
and
proved
the
practicability
of
it
for
the
public
good
i
told
them
this
in
lectures
at
glasgow
long
ago
and
exhibited
before
them
children
to
prove
the
truths
i
promulgated
both
there
and
in
other
parts
of
scotland
to
convince
a
doubting
and
cautious
public
that
my
views
were
practicable
i
may
add
in
passing
that
i
found
the
scotch
took
nothing
on
trust
they
would
listen
to
my
lectures
but
it
always
ended
in
my
being
obliged
to
prove
it
with
children
to
david
stow
much
credit
is
due
for
having
written
useful
books
and
performed
useful
works
i
am
not
the
man
to
deprive
him
of
this
his
just
due
but
i
have
such
faith
in
the
honour
of
his
countrymen
in
general
that
i
believe
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
some
one
of
them
will
give
to
me
that
credit
which
is
fairly
and
justly
due
to
me
with
respect
to
the
educational
movements
in
scotland
no
class
of
men
are
better
able
to
appreciate
and
understand
the
principles
on
which
a
system
of
true
education
should
be
based
than
scotchmen
and
hence
though
cautious
in
taking
up
new
things
or
new
views
of
things
they
can
do
justice
to
and
appreciate
that
which
is
worthy
of
their
attention
at
the
time
i
have
been
speaking
of
there
were
no
lessons
published
suitable
for
us
i
searched
the
print
shops
in
the
metropolis
and
with
the
aid
of
drawings
from
friends
supplied
this
deficiency
next
i
had
suitable
lessons
printed
to
accompany
them
and
also
spelling
lessons
of
such
words
as
could
be
and
then
followed
suitable
reading
lessons
prints
of
objects
and
the
simple
forms
of
geometry
when
a
demand
was
created
for
all
these
the
publishing
trade
took
them
up
and
thus
the
numerous
excellent
plates
and
lessons
now
published
for
the
purposes
of
teaching
had
their
first
origin
i
ant
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
first
seven
years
of
a
life
is
the
and
if
i
can
induce
mankind
generally
to
think
with
me
and
to
act
on
the
principles
humbly
laid
open
in
the
succeeding
chapters
of
this
book
i
may
feel
some
consolation
that
i
have
not
lived
in
vain
sure
i
am
that
if
the
world
will
only
give
man
a
fair
chance
and
train
him
from
the
beginning
with
care
with
prudence
with
caution
with
circumspection
with
freedom
and
above
all
with
he
will
bear
such
fruit
under
the
blessing
of
god
as
will
make
even
this
world
as
a
paradise
from
childhood
up
to
age
has
this
truth
been
perfecting
and
strengthening
in
me
and
i
have
no
more
doubt
that
it
is
a
truth
than
i
have
of
my
own
existence
who
can
look
upon
a
child
without
admiring
it
without
loving
it
with
my
feelings
it
is
impossible
when
i
compare
the
revealed
will
of
god
the
scriptures
with
his
other
great
book
the
book
of
nature
which
i
read
so
early
in
life
and
read
with
delight
to
this
present
hour
i
see
the
one
illustrates
the
other
i
see
that
the
ground
produces
the
but
not
if
cultivated
what
does
not
care
do
for
all
things
in
nature
why
not
then
for
man
let
him
run
wild
through
neglect
and
undoubtedly
he
produces
weeds
but
this
to
my
mind
is
an
argument
in
his
favour
and
shews
the
ground
is
capable
of
producing
rich
fruits
when
we
study
the
true
nature
of
his
mind
with
the
same
assiduity
as
we
now
do
study
the
nature
of
his
body
then
will
mankind
see
it
in
this
light
begin
at
the
right
end
and
cultivate
from
the
first
the
beautiful
faculties
of
his
own
species
i
say
beautiful
and
are
not
the
budding
faculties
of
childhood
both
beautiful
and
lovely
feed
my
lambs
saith
the
lord
jesus
but
reader
are
they
all
duly
fed
in
this
rich
wealthy
and
christian
country
how
many
on
the
contrary
are
fed
with
evil
influences
street
associations
and
are
thus
poisoned
at
every
pore
until
their
being
is
thoroughly
contaminated
through
neglect
public
and
private
and
when
not
orphans
even
parental
neglect
also
and
then
after
having
increased
our
county
rates
enlarged
our
prisons
and
built
union
workhouses
with
respect
to
morals
and
training
for
the
young
i
say
we
add
ragged
schools
we
allow
them
to
become
contaminated
and
when
that
is
accomplished
we
go
to
work
to
undo
what
has
been
done
if
this
does
not
succeed
we
punish
by
law
the
poor
neglected
beings
for
taking
the
poisons
we
really
offered
them
oh
rare
consistency
in
this
boasted
age
of
light
and
science
and
learning
let
us
therefore
first
seek
an
education
worthy
of
the
name
and
then
find
the
best
means
of
carrying
it
out
what
exists
at
present
is
fundamentally
defective
especially
by
beginning
too
late
and
as
regards
the
plans
and
principles
laid
down
for
infants
in
many
cases
much
has
been
merely
travestied
and
many
of
the
most
essential
parts
entirely
set
aside
or
overlooked
the
amount
of
solid
information
that
may
be
given
to
an
infant
by
a
wise
and
judicious
mother
during
the
first
two
years
only
would
appear
to
many
persons
astonishing
i
have
as
clear
a
recollection
of
what
my
mother
taught
me
at
two
years
old
as
i
have
of
that
which
she
taught
me
at
the
age
of
six
the
facts
crowd
upon
me
so
fast
that
i
scarcely
know
where
to
stop
those
lessons
were
the
germs
of
the
inventions
and
babyisms
the
and
the
like
with
which
the
infants
are
so
delighted
in
their
schools
and
which
at
the
time
they
were
developed
about
a
third
of
a
century
since
were
scouted
and
the
inventor
looked
upon
as
a
good
natured
simpleton
or
a
fool
i
have
a
rather
vivid
recollection
of
this
fact
but
in
the
end
as
we
proceeded
many
who
came
to
sneer
went
away
with
very
different
feelings
the
plans
were
for
infants
for
infants
they
answered
well
but
i
wish
i
could
say
that
no
excresences
had
grown
upon
them
now
the
ends
to
be
answered
in
infant
education
as
intended
by
me
are
as
follows
first
to
feed
the
child
faculties
with
suitable
food
second
to
simplify
and
explain
everything
so
as
to
adapt
it
properly
to
those
faculties
third
not
to
overdo
anything
either
by
giving
too
much
instruction
or
instruction
beyond
their
years
and
thus
the
brain
and
injure
the
faculties
and
fourth
ever
to
blend
both
exercise
and
amusement
with
instruction
at
due
intervals
which
is
readily
effected
by
a
moderate
amount
of
singing
alternating
with
the
usual
motions
and
evolutions
in
the
schoolroom
and
the
unfettered
freedom
of
the
if
these
rules
be
attended
to
the
following
results
are
certain
a
higher
state
of
physical
mental
and
moral
health
physical
health
is
essential
to
mental
vigour
if
it
is
to
come
to
manhood
if
the
physical
mental
moral
and
spiritual
constitution
be
properly
acted
upon
fed
and
trained
it
adds
to
the
happiness
of
the
child
but
if
this
is
not
done
it
becomes
miserable
and
as
a
consequence
restless
troublesome
and
mischievous
such
facts
were
made
very
evident
to
me
by
the
infants
under
my
care
in
the
earlier
part
of
my
career
and
also
have
been
fully
confirmed
throughout
it
and
they
have
forced
me
as
it
were
to
that
more
lively
interesting
and
amusing
mode
of
instruction
which
i
have
through
life
endeavoured
to
propagate
i
found
children
to
be
highly
delighted
with
pictures
and
hence
their
value
and
high
importance
is
so
strongly
insisted
on
in
all
my
books
and
the
best
methods
of
using
them
distinctly
laid
down
the
trouble
of
rightly
using
such
lessons
has
caused
them
to
be
almost
entirely
laid
aside
in
very
many
existing
infant
schools
and
in
too
many
instances
the
mere
learning
and
repeating
of
sounds
by
rote
or
what
may
very
properly
be
called
the
parrot
system
has
been
introduced
in
their
place
but
i
yet
hope
that
the
good
sense
of
the
public
will
in
the
end
remedy
such
defects
in
such
cases
the
memory
is
the
only
faculty
exercised
and
that
at
the
expense
of
those
that
are
higher
where
this
is
persisted
in
the
infant
system
is
rendered
nugatory
and
my
labours
are
in
vain
it
therefore
can
not
be
too
strongly
insisted
on
and
too
frequently
repeated
that
one
of
its
most
fundamental
principles
as
regards
the
unfolding
properly
and
easily
of
the
intellectual
faculties
is
to
communicate
and
rather
than
words
and
sounds
or
at
least
to
let
them
be
done
together
as
before
stated
the
gallery
had
its
origin
in
my
desire
to
teach
the
children
simultaneously
it
enables
a
teacher
more
readily
to
secure
their
full
attention
in
all
oral
lessons
and
establishes
a
sympathy
between
them
more
real
facts
may
be
taught
children
simultaneously
by
the
master
than
can
be
taught
by
all
the
monitors
in
a
school
the
little
infants
should
always
sit
at
the
bottom
and
by
no
means
be
confined
to
another
room
they
can
see
and
hear
all
that
is
going
on
and
understand
it
far
more
than
you
would
suppose
though
they
can
not
yet
tell
all
they
learn
and
know
but
when
the
power
of
speech
comes
they
will
surprise
you
with
what
they
have
learned
it
is
therefore
a
great
error
to
separate
children
and
cut
them
off
from
the
advantage
of
all
and
because
they
are
the
youngest
they
learn
more
through
sympathy
and
communion
with
their
five
or
six
year
elders
than
the
most
clever
adult
can
teach
them
an
is
in
many
respects
a
community
in
a
state
of
nature
what
one
does
the
other
almost
involuntarily
learns
the
merest
infants
are
not
an
exception
to
this
rule
and
therefore
the
separation
in
many
of
the
children
invariably
into
two
classes
sometimes
in
two
rooms
is
a
great
mistake
and
can
only
arise
from
ignorance
of
the
laws
under
which
the
young
mind
unfolds
itself
and
a
misunderstanding
of
the
first
principles
of
perhaps
one
reason
that
teaching
has
not
been
kept
up
to
its
proper
point
and
true
standing
is
the
desire
to
make
a
striking
shew
before
the
visitors
in
a
school
i
fear
the
grounds
for
this
opinion
are
not
slight
perhaps
nothing
has
lead
more
to
the
multiplication
of
singing
even
to
the
injury
of
the
children
the
ease
with
which
they
learn
a
metrical
piece
by
and
the
readiness
with
which
they
acquire
a
tune
to
it
is
surprising
and
as
the
exhibition
of
such
attainments
forms
a
striking
sinew
in
many
cases
little
else
is
taught
them
but
to
a
sensible
and
thinking
mind
one
single
piece
that
is
one
where
clear
ideas
are
annexed
to
the
words
in
the
minds
of
the
children
is
worth
a
hundred
where
this
is
not
the
case
intellectual
improvement
and
moral
training
are
not
thus
easily
exhibited
especially
the
latter
but
on
dilligent
attention
to
these
the
real
and
permanent
utility
of
the
schools
depends
many
things
have
been
taught
most
unsuitable
for
young
children
and
that
simplicity
which
is
so
absolutely
requisite
both
as
regards
matter
and
language
seriously
departed
from
let
but
the
great
principle
of
teaching
through
the
senses
be
borne
distinctly
in
mind
and
of
giving
ideas
in
preference
to
sounds
and
it
will
have
a
strong
tendency
to
put
an
end
to
the
evil
complained
of
how
much
may
be
taught
by
the
simplest
object
such
as
a
stone
form
weight
hardness
colour
sound
and
numerous
other
qualities
and
properties
all
of
which
must
be
clearly
understood
because
they
are
demonstrated
by
the
sight
and
other
senses
once
give
to
the
mind
a
store
of
clear
ideas
in
regular
and
natural
order
and
a
series
of
words
that
are
distinct
and
definite
in
meaning
and
you
have
laid
a
firm
foundation
whereon
to
exercise
the
higher
faculties
of
reflection
and
reasoning
still
more
is
it
of
paramount
importance
to
educate
and
bring
out
the
moral
faculties
to
cultivate
the
sense
of
right
and
wrong
to
enlighten
and
strengthen
the
young
conscience
to
teach
the
love
of
good
and
the
hatred
of
evil
and
to
strive
to
bring
the
whole
being
under
the
new
commandment
of
christ
that
ye
love
one
another
the
golden
rule
to
do
unto
others
as
ye
would
that
they
should
do
unto
you
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
precepts
that
can
be
applied
to
awaken
just
moral
feelings
and
innumerable
instances
must
occur
in
the
varied
events
which
happen
in
a
school
to
bring
it
home
powerfully
to
the
heart
and
illustrate
it
appropriately
perhaps
in
nothing
has
that
simplicity
of
teaching
so
requisite
for
the
young
and
so
earnestly
contended
for
by
me
throughout
been
so
much
disregarded
neglected
and
preverted
as
in
the
matter
of
religion
i
taught
from
the
first
by
means
of
pictures
properly
selected
scriptural
truths
and
facts
histories
and
parables
and
also
suitable
texts
and
simple
hymns
and
prayers
were
added
this
surely
was
enough
for
i
thought
so
then
and
i
think
so
still
for
an
overdoing
always
ends
in
an
undoing
and
the
mind
of
a
child
should
never
be
crammed
with
that
which
it
can
not
understand
to
the
neglect
of
that
which
it
may
i
have
opened
schools
for
many
sects
and
parties
and
have
been
sorry
to
find
them
so
prone
to
bind
the
grevious
burdens
of
their
own
peculiar
dogmas
on
the
feeble
minds
of
little
children
to
the
neglect
of
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
justice
mercy
and
the
love
of
god
i
hope
a
time
will
come
when
the
distinct
precepts
of
christ
in
this
respect
will
be
more
faithfully
regarded
the
religion
for
infants
should
be
a
simple
trust
in
the
love
and
kindness
of
god
our
saviour
a
desire
of
grace
and
strength
from
him
and
an
aim
to
live
thereby
in
love
and
duty
to
their
parents
and
teachers
and
in
kindness
and
affection
with
their
brothers
sisters
and
schoolfellows
such
things
as
these
their
young
minds
may
apprehend
feel
and
apply
and
thus
be
strengthened
and
benefitted
but
scholastic
subtelties
and
controverted
dogmas
such
as
the
are
perpetually
disputing
about
surely
should
never
be
taught
to
infants
by
any
one
who
has
carefully
considered
the
subject
and
properly
studied
the
nature
of
the
infant
mind
in
all
probability
advancing
years
will
prevent
me
in
future
from
personally
labouring
much
in
the
cause
and
from
personally
overcoming
objections
by
presenting
publicly
facts
that
can
not
be
refuted
it
is
out
of
my
power
now
to
employ
agents
and
pay
them
i
can
not
take
infants
by
sea
and
land
to
convince
unbelievers
and
silence
gainsayers
neither
circumstances
nor
remaining
strength
will
allow
me
to
repeat
these
things
i
must
trust
then
to
my
pen
to
the
thinkers
amongst
us
and
above
all
to
the
good
providence
of
god
for
further
success
in
behalf
of
the
rising
generation
those
who
doubt
what
i
assert
about
children
should
recollect
one
fact
thousand
have
passed
through
my
hands
and
were
for
a
short
time
under
my
training
and
have
then
been
examined
by
me
to
convince
a
doubting
public
on
the
spot
where
they
happened
to
be
in
each
town
and
country
all
this
for
the
period
of
of
a
century
ought
not
this
to
entitle
me
as
respects
the
education
of
children
to
say
such
a
thing
is
right
or
even
such
a
thing
is
wrong
the
abuse
of
a
plan
is
no
argument
against
its
use
that
it
has
been
abused
i
am
well
aware
that
the
has
been
revived
and
also
applied
in
it
was
never
intended
to
injure
the
young
brain
by
it
or
to
fill
the
memory
with
useless
rubbish
yet
this
is
done
i
can
not
help
it
i
have
done
and
will
do
my
best
to
prevent
such
a
violation
of
the
very
first
principles
of
infant
teaching
to
conclude
there
is
much
to
be
thankful
for
since
the
was
evolved
a
very
great
improvement
has
taken
place
in
the
character
of
and
also
in
prints
the
graphic
illustrations
and
the
simplicity
of
style
on
a
variety
of
subjects
is
admirable
the
same
may
be
said
with
respect
to
nursery
books
i
see
a
great
improvement
in
all
these
this
is
comforting
to
one
situated
as
i
am
and
leads
me
to
hope
much
from
the
future
i
trust
the
intellectual
character
of
the
age
will
advance
and
not
only
the
intellectual
but
also
the
moral
and
spiritual
and
that
truth
and
justice
religion
and
piety
may
be
established
amongst
us
for
all
generations

bishop
of
it
has
long
been
a
subject
of
regret
as
well
as
of
astonishment
to
the
reflecting
and
benevolent
that
notwithstanding
the
numerous
institutions
which
exist
in
this
country
for
the
education
and
improvement
of
the
poor
and
in
defiance
of
the
endeavours
of
our
magistracy
and
police
establishment
crime
should
rather
increase
than
diminish
many
persons
have
been
induced
to
conclude
from
this
fact
that
our
sunday
parochial
and
national
schools
as
well
as
our
bible
societies
and
institutions
of
a
similar
nature
are
of
little
or
no
use
absurd
as
the
inference
is
i
have
known
more
than
one
or
two
persons
draw
it
not
considering
that
although
these
means
may
be
insufficient
to
counteract
the
cause
of
crime
or
to
prevent
all
its
evil
effects
yet
nevertheless
they
must
certainly
check
its
progress
that
if
there
be
many
offenders
despite
of
these
institutions
there
would
doubtless
be
many
more
were
they
not
in
existence
and
hence
to
revile
or
neglect
them
is
unworthy
of
good
sense
or
good
feeling
it
is
not
my
purpose
in
the
present
chapter
to
dwell
on
the
commission
of
crime
generally
but
on
juvenile
delinquency
in
particular
and
on
this
only
so
far
as
regards
the
case
of
young
children
i
will
therefore
make
public
a
collection
of
facts
some
of
which
were
obtained
at
considerable
personal
hazard
and
inconvenience
which
will
place
it
in
a
clear
yet
painful
light
it
is
said
that
in
the
year
the
number
of
boys
in
london
alone
who
procured
a
considerable
part
of
their
subsistence
by
and
thieving
in
every
possible
form
was
estimated
at
from
eleven
to
fifteen
hundred
one
man
who
lived
in
near
spitalfields
had
forty
boys
in
training
to
steal
and
pick
pockets
who
were
paid
for
their
exertions
with
a
part
of
the
plunder
fortunately
however
for
the
public
this
notable
tutor
of
thieves
was
himself
convicted
of
theft
and
transported
this
system
of
tutorage
is
by
no
means
uncommon
nor
is
it
confined
to
the
male
sex
i
remember
reading
some
time
back
in
the
police
reports
of
a
woman
who
had
entrapped
or
ten
from
their
parents
had
trained
them
up
and
sent
them
out
thieving
nor
was
it
until
one
of
these
infantile
depredators
was
taken
in
the
act
of
stealing
that
this
was
made
known
and
the
children
restored
to
their
homes
here
we
see
eight
or
ten
children
probably
from
the
neglect
of
their
parents
enticed
away
no
doubt
by
the
promise
of
a
few
cakes
or
of
some
other
trifling
reward
and
in
imminent
danger
of
becoming
confirmed
thieves
from
which
they
were
rescued
by
this
providential
discovery
of
their
situation
and
we
know
not
how
many
children
may
have
been
led
to
evil
practices
in
like
manner
i
will
give
another
instance
which
occurred
at
the
office
at
queen
a
female
apparently
no
more
than
nineteen
years
of
age
named
jane
smith
and
a
child
just
turned
of
five
years
old
named
mary
ann
ranniford
were
put
to
the
bar
before
edward
markland
the
magistrate
charged
with
circulating
counterfeit
coin
in
westminster
and
the
county
of
surrey
to
a
vast
extent
it
appeared
that
the
elder
prisoner
had
long
been
known
to
be
a
common
utterer
of
base
coin
in
which
she
dealt
very
largely
with
those
individuals
who
are
agents
in
london
to
the
manufacturers
of
the
spurious
commodity
in
birmingham
she
had
been
once
or
twice
before
charged
with
the
offence
and
therefore
she
became
so
notorious
that
she
was
necessitated
to
leave
off
putting
the
bad
money
away
herself
but
so
determined
was
she
to
keep
up
the
traffic
that
she
was
in
the
habit
of
employing
children
of
tender
years
to
pass
the
counterfeit
money
on
one
occasion
two
bow
street
officers
observed
her
at
her
old
trade
in
company
with
the
child
ranniford
the
officers
kept
a
strict
eye
upon
her
movements
and
saw
her
several
times
pass
something
to
the
little
girl
and
she
by
the
direction
of
her
instructor
went
into
different
shops
such
as
hosiers
where
she
purchased
balls
of
worsted
tobacconists
and
fruiterers
where
she
passed
the
bad
money
and
received
in
return
goods
and
change
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
the
patroles
saw
the
prisoner
smith
deliver
something
to
the
child
and
point
out
the
shop
of
isaacs
a
fruiterer
in
bridge
street
westminster
the
child
went
in
and
asked
for
a
juicy
lemon
and
gave
a
counterfeit
shilling
in
payment
isaacs
had
no
suspicion
from
the
tender
age
of
the
utterer
and
its
respectable
appearance
that
the
money
was
bad
and
was
about
to
give
change
when
one
of
the
officers
entered
and
took
the
deluded
child
into
custody
whilst
his
companion
secured
the
elder
prisoner
smith
and
on
searching
her
pockets
he
found
twelve
bad
shillings
some
parcels
of
snuff
several
balls
of
cotton
and
worsted
and
other
trifling
articles
which
the
child
had
purchased
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
officers
who
had
secured
them
learned
from
the
child
that
her
parents
lived
in
cross
street
east
lane
walworth
and
that
smith
had
taken
her
out
for
a
walk
the
patrol
instantly
communicated
the
circumstance
to
the
child
parents
who
were
honest
people
and
their
feelings
on
hearing
that
their
infant
had
been
seduced
into
the
commission
of
such
a
crime
can
be
more
easily
conceived
than
described
they
stated
that
the
woman
smith
had
formerly
lived
in
the
same
street
and
was
frequently
giving
and
cakes
to
the
child
who
would
in
consequence
follow
her
anywhere
some
time
since
she
removed
to
lock
square
fields
and
they
the
parents
had
not
seen
her
for
some
time
on
the
day
referred
to
the
child
was
playing
in
the
street
and
not
finding
her
come
home
they
became
alarmed
and
went
everywhere
broken
hearted
in
quest
of
her
but
they
could
hear
no
tidings
of
her
till
the
sad
news
was
brought
them
by
the
officers
the
poor
mother
was
now
in
attendance
and
her
feelings
were
dreadfully
affected
and
excited
the
commiseration
of
all
present
the
prisoner
smith
made
no
defence
and
held
her
head
down
during
the
examination
the
child
stood
by
her
and
took
no
notice
of
the
proceedings
and
they
were
both
fully
committed
for
trial
the
mother
on
seeing
her
infant
consigned
to
prison
became
quite
frantic
and
wept
hysterically
and
had
it
it
not
been
for
the
gaoler
she
would
have
inflicted
some
violence
upon
the
woman
smith
for
seducing
her
infant
facts
of
this
kind
are
sufficient
to
shew
the
utility
indeed
i
may
say
the
most
absolute
necessity
of
providing
some
means
far
very
far
more
efficient
than
those
at
present
in
existence
for
the
protection
and
improvement
of
the
infant
poor
that
they
may
not
thus
fall
into
the
hands
of
evil
and
designing
wretches
who
make
a
living
by
encouraging
the
children
of
the
poor
to
commit
crimes
of
the
produce
of
which
they
themselves
take
the
greatest
part
the
younger
the
children
are
the
better
they
suit
the
purposes
of
such
miscreants
because
if
children
are
detected
in
any
dishonest
act
they
know
well
that
few
persons
will
do
more
than
give
the
child
or
children
a
tap
on
the
head
and
send
them
about
their
business
the
tenth
part
of
the
crimes
committed
by
these
juvenile
offenders
never
comes
under
public
view
because
should
any
person
be
robbed
by
a
child
and
detect
him
in
the
act
he
is
silenced
by
the
with
this
remark
oh
he
is
but
a
child
let
him
go
this
time
perhaps
the
poor
thing
has
done
it
from
necessity
being
in
want
of
bread
thus
the
delinquent
is
almost
sure
to
escape
and
instead
of
being
punished
is
not
unfrequently
rewarded
for
the
adventure
as
was
the
case
in
the
following
instance
having
had
occasion
to
walk
through
shoreditch
some
time
since
i
saw
a
number
of
persons
collected
together
round
a
little
boy
who
it
appeared
had
stolen
a
brass
weight
from
the
shop
of
a
grocer
the
shopman
stated
that
three
boys
came
into
the
shop
for
of
candied
horehound
and
that
while
he
was
getting
down
the
glass
which
contained
it
one
of
them
contrived
to
purloin
the
weight
in
question
having
some
suspicion
of
the
boys
from
the
circumstance
of
having
recently
lost
a
number
of
brass
weights
he
kept
his
eyes
on
them
when
he
saw
one
put
his
hand
into
a
box
that
was
on
the
counter
take
out
the
largest
weight
and
then
run
out
of
the
shop
followed
by
the
other
two
the
boy
who
stole
it
slipped
the
weight
into
the
hand
of
one
of
the
others
but
the
shopman
having
observed
this
manoeuvre
followed
the
boy
who
had
the
weight
who
being
the
youngest
of
the
three
could
not
run
very
fast
he
finding
himself
closely
pursued
threw
the
weight
into
the
road
and
when
he
was
taken
declared
that
it
was
not
he
who
took
it
the
man
wished
to
take
the
child
back
to
the
shop
in
order
that
his
master
might
do
with
him
as
he
thought
proper
but
the
with
a
charitable
which
evinced
little
prevented
him
one
man
in
particular
seemed
to
interest
himself
much
in
the
boy
behalf
stating
that
he
knew
the
child
very
well
and
that
he
had
neither
father
nor
mother
the
child
immediately
took
up
this
plea
and
added
that
he
had
had
no
victuals
all
day
the
individual
before
mentioned
then
gave
him
a
penny
and
his
example
was
followed
by
many
more
till
i
think
the
boy
had
obtained
nearly
a
shilling
i
put
several
questions
to
him
but
was
checked
by
this
fellow
who
told
me
that
as
i
had
given
the
child
nothing
i
had
no
right
to
ask
so
much
and
after
a
great
deal
of
abuse
he
ended
by
telling
me
that
if
i
did
not
take
myself
off
he
would
give
me
something
for
myself
feeling
however
a
great
desire
to
sift
further
into
the
matter
i
feigned
to
withdraw
but
kept
my
eye
upon
the
boy
and
followed
him
for
nearly
two
hours
until
i
saw
him
join
two
other
boys
one
of
whom
i
had
not
seen
before
and
who
had
a
bag
with
something
very
heavy
in
it
which
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
were
weights
or
something
which
they
had
obtained
in
a
similar
manner
wishing
to
ascertain
the
fact
i
approached
them
but
they
no
sooner
perceived
me
than
the
little
fellow
who
had
been
the
principal
actor
in
the
affair
called
out
a
no
doubt
agreed
upon
amongst
them
when
they
all
ran
down
some
obscure
alleys
i
followed
but
was
knocked
down
as
if
by
accident
by
two
fellows
who
continued
to
detain
me
with
apologies
till
the
boys
had
got
safely
away
i
have
little
doubt
that
this
was
an
instance
of
that
organized
system
of
depredation
of
which
i
have
before
spoken
and
that
the
man
who
took
so
active
a
part
at
the
first
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
and
in
fact
the
tutor
and
employer
of
the
predatory
urchins
his
activity
in
preventing
the
boy
from
being
taken
back
to
the
shop
his
anxiety
to
promote
a
subscription
for
the
boy
and
lastly
his
threat
of
personal
violence
if
i
interfered
in
the
matter
by
continuing
to
question
the
child
all
these
circumstances
confirm
me
in
the
opinion
it
is
only
by
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
the
association
of
infant
offenders
with
those
of
maturer
and
hardened
habits
that
we
can
account
for
such
cases
as
the
on
the
of
july
a
child
seven
years
was
brought
before
the
magistrate
at
lambeth
street
office
charged
with
frequently
robbing
his
mother
and
was
ordered
to
be
locked
up
all
night
in
the
in
the
evening
however
when
his
mother
returned
he
forced
his
way
out
of
the
room
and
behaved
with
such
violence
that
the
attendants
were
obliged
to
iron
both
his
hands
and
legs
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
child
had
been
for
a
long
time
under
the
instruction
and
evil
influence
of
some
old
and
hardened
offender
he
must
indeed
have
undergone
much
training
before
he
could
have
arrived
at
such
a
pitch
of
hardihood
as
to
make
it
necessary
to
handcuff
and
fetter
a
child
of
so
tender
an
age
and
to
enable
him
to
hold
even
the
magistrates
officers
and
his
own
parent
at
defiance
the
following
cases
afford
further
proof
of
the
same
lamentable
truth
the
first
is
extracted
from
a
morning
paper
of
the
of
september
a
little
boy
not
more
than
years
of
was
brought
before
the
lord
mayor
at
the
mansion
house
on
saturday
the
instant
having
been
found
in
a
warehouse
where
he
had
secreted
himself
for
the
purpose
of
thieving
at
a
late
hour
on
friday
night
a
watchman
was
going
his
round
when
on
trying
a
warehouse
in
which
there
was
much
valuable
property
to
see
whether
it
was
safe
he
heard
the
little
prisoner
cry
the
persons
who
had
the
care
of
the
warehouse
were
roused
and
he
was
taken
out
in
his
fright
he
acknowledged
that
a
man
had
taken
him
from
his
mother
and
induced
him
upon
a
promise
of
reward
to
steal
into
the
warehouse
upon
a
concerted
signal
he
was
to
act
as
directed
by
the
fellow
on
the
outside
but
becoming
terrified
at
being
confined
so
long
in
the
dark
he
had
cried
out
and
discovered
himself
his
mother
came
forward
and
received
a
good
character
as
the
wife
of
a
man
the
lord
mayor
gave
her
son
up
to
her
with
an
injunction
to
act
carefully
and
strictly
with
him
there
was
reason
to
believe
he
said
that
several
considerable
robberies
had
been
recently
committed
by
means
of
children
like
the
prisoner
who
stole
in
and
remained
concealed
until
midnight
when
they
gave
admission
to
the
robbers
the
police
should
have
their
eyes
upon
him
the
other
instance
is
from
a
report
of
one
of
the
sessions
in
london
william
hart
an
urchin
years
of
was
indicted
for
stealing
shillings
in
money
numbered
from
the
person
of
mary
conner
the
prosecutrix
stated
that
on
the
day
named
in
the
indictment
she
took
shillings
to
get
something
out
of
pledge
but
as
there
was
a
crowd
in
assembled
to
witness
a
fight
she
was
induced
to
join
the
mob
while
standing
there
she
felt
something
move
in
her
pocket
and
putting
her
hand
outside
her
clothes
she
laid
hold
of
what
proved
to
be
the
hand
of
the
prisoner
which
she
held
until
she
had
given
him
a
slap
on
the
face
and
then
she
let
him
go
but
on
feeling
in
her
pocket
she
discovered
that
the
theft
had
actually
been
committed
and
that
only
three
shillings
were
left
a
constable
took
the
urchin
into
custody
and
accused
him
of
robbing
her
of
shillings
the
prisoner
said
have
shillings
in
my
pocket
but
it
is
my
mother
money
she
gets
so
drunk
she
gives
me
her
money
to
take
care
of
the
officer
stated
to
the
same
effect
as
the
prosecutrix
and
added
that
a
secret
pocket
in
his
jacket
he
found
fourteen
shilling
and
sixpence
it
was
the
practice
of
gangs
of
pickpockets
to
have
a
child
like
this
to
commit
the
robbery
and
hand
the
plunder
to
witness
went
to
his
parents
who
said
he
had
been
absent
seven
weeks
and
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
baron
garrow
in
feeling
terms
lamented
that
a
child
of
such
tender
years
should
be
so
depraved
he
added
suppose
gentlemen
i
need
only
to
ask
you
to
deliver
your
verdict
his
lordship
then
observed
that
he
would
consult
with
his
learned
brother
as
to
the
best
manner
of
disposing
of
the
prisoner
they
at
length
decided
that
although
it
might
seem
harsh
the
court
would
record
against
him
fourteen
years
transportation
and
no
doubt
government
would
place
him
in
some
school
if
he
behaved
well
there
the
sentence
might
not
be
carried
into
full
effect
i
remember
a
query
being
once
put
to
me
by
a
person
who
visited
the
spitalfields
infant
school
at
the
time
it
was
under
my
management
how
can
you
account
for
the
fact
that
notwithstanding
there
are
so
many
old
and
experienced
thieves
detected
convicted
and
sent
out
of
the
country
every
session
we
can
not
perceive
any
dimunition
of
the
numbers
of
such
characters
but
that
others
seem
always
to
supply
their
places
the
foregoing
instance
of
the
systematized
instruction
of
young
delinquents
by
old
adepts
in
the
art
of
pilfering
affords
i
think
a
satisfactory
answer
the
interrogatory
the
dexterity
of
experienced
thieves
shews
that
no
small
degree
of
care
and
attention
is
bestowed
on
their
tuition
the
first
task
of
novices
i
have
been
informed
is
to
go
in
companies
of
threes
or
fours
through
the
respectable
streets
and
squares
of
the
metropolis
and
with
an
old
knife
or
a
similar
instrument
to
wrench
off
the
usually
placed
over
the
of
the
which
they
sell
at
the
marine
and
they
are
said
sometimes
to
realize
three
or
four
shillings
a
day
by
this
means
wishing
to
be
satisfied
on
the
point
i
have
walked
round
many
of
the
squares
in
town
and
in
more
than
a
solitary
experiment
have
found
that
one
gate
in
had
any
over
the
it
had
moreover
been
evidently
wrenched
off
a
small
piece
of
the
brass
still
remaining
on
many
of
the
gates
having
practised
this
branch
of
the
profession
a
considerable
time
and
become
adepts
in
its
execution
the
next
step
i
have
been
informed
is
to
steal
the
handles
and
brass
knockers
from
doors
which
is
done
by
taking
out
the
screw
with
a
small
these
are
disposed
of
in
the
same
manner
as
the
former
things
till
the
young
pilferers
are
progressively
qualified
for
stealing
brass
weights
and
at
length
become
expert
thieves
the
following
fact
will
shew
what
extensive
depredations
young
children
are
capable
of
committing
i
have
inserted
the
whole
as
it
appeared
in
the
public
papers
yesterday
two
little
girls
sisters
very
neatly
dressed
and
the
seven
years
of
were
put
to
the
bar
charged
by
cornell
of
high
street
newington
with
having
stolen
a
piece
of
printed
calico
from
the
corner
of
his
shop
cornell
stated
that
the
children
came
to
his
shop
yesterday
morning
and
while
he
was
engaged
with
his
customers
at
the
further
end
of
the
shop
he
happened
to
cast
his
eyes
where
the
prisoners
were
and
observed
the
oldest
roll
up
a
large
piece
of
printed
calico
and
put
it
into
a
basket
which
her
little
sister
carried
the
witness
immediately
advanced
to
her
and
asked
if
she
had
taken
any
thing
from
off
the
counter
but
she
positively
asserted
that
she
had
not
however
on
searching
her
basket
the
calico
was
found
together
with
a
piece
of
muslin
which
cornell
identified
as
belonging
to
him
and
to
have
been
taken
in
the
above
way
allen
questioned
the
eldest
girl
about
the
robbery
but
she
positively
denied
any
knowledge
as
to
how
or
in
what
manner
the
calico
and
muslin
had
got
into
her
basket
frequently
appealing
to
her
little
sister
to
confirm
the
truth
of
what
she
declared
when
asked
if
she
had
ever
been
charged
with
any
offence
she
replied
yes
sir
some
time
back
i
was
accused
of
stealing
a
watch
from
a
house
but
i
did
not
do
it
the
magistrate
observed
that
the
father
should
be
made
acquainted
with
the
circumstance
and
in
the
mean
time
gave
the
gaoler
instructions
that
the
two
little
delinquents
should
be
taken
care
of
hall
the
officer
stated
that
he
had
information
that
there
was
a
quantity
of
goods
which
had
been
stolen
by
the
prisoners
concealed
in
a
certain
desk
in
the
house
of
the
father
and
that
a
great
deal
of
stolen
property
would
in
all
probability
be
found
there
if
a
search
warrant
were
granted
as
the
two
unfortunate
children
were
believed
to
be
most
extensive
depredators
allen
immediately
granted
the
warrant
and
hall
accompanied
by
cornell
proceeded
to
the
residence
of
the
father
of
the
children
who
is
an
auctioneer
and
appraiser
at
lyon
street
newington
hall
returned
in
half
an
hour
with
the
father
in
his
custody
and
produced
a
great
quantity
of
black
silk
handkerchiefs
which
he
had
found
on
the
premises
but
the
desk
which
had
been
spoken
of
by
his
informers
as
containing
stolen
property
he
had
found
quite
empty
the
father
when
questioned
by
the
witness
as
to
whether
he
had
any
duplicates
of
property
in
his
possession
positively
denied
that
fact
at
the
office
he
was
searched
and
about
fifty
duplicates
were
found
in
his
pockets
most
of
which
were
for
silk
handkerchiefs
and
shawls
there
were
also
a
few
rings
for
the
possession
of
which
the
prisoner
could
not
satisfactorily
account
he
was
asked
why
he
had
assured
the
officer
he
had
no
duplicates
he
replied
that
he
had
not
said
so
but
cornell
who
was
present
during
the
search
averred
that
the
prisoner
had
most
positively
declared
that
he
had
not
a
duplicate
in
his
possession
watt
a
of
harper
street
kent
road
stated
that
he
attended
in
consequence
of
seeing
the
police
reports
in
the
newspapers
describing
the
two
children
he
immediately
recognised
the
two
little
girls
as
having
frequently
called
at
his
shop
for
trifling
articles
and
added
that
he
had
been
robbed
of
a
variety
of
silk
handkerchiefs
and
shawls
and
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
the
prisoners
were
the
thieves
it
was
their
practice
he
said
to
go
into
a
shop
and
call
for
a
quarter
of
a
yard
of
muslin
and
while
the
shopkeeper
was
engaged
the
eldest
would
very
dexterously
slip
whatever
article
was
nearest
to
her
little
sister
who
was
trained
to
the
business
and
would
thrust
the
stolen
property
into
a
basket
which
she
always
carried
for
that
purpose
watt
identified
the
silk
handkerchiefs
as
his
property
and
said
that
they
had
been
stolen
in
the
above
manner
by
the
prisoners
the
father
was
asked
where
he
had
got
the
handkerchiefs
he
replied
that
he
had
bought
them
from
a
pedlar
for
a
piece
at
his
door
however
his
eldest
daughter
contradicted
him
by
acknowledging
that
her
sister
had
stolen
them
from
the
shop
of
watt
he
became
dreadfully
agitated
and
then
said
could
i
say
surely
i
was
not
to
criminate
my
own
children
allen
observed
that
there
was
a
clear
case
against
the
two
children
but
after
consulting
with
the
other
magistrates
he
was
of
opinion
that
the
youngest
child
should
be
given
up
into
the
charge
of
the
parish
officers
of
newington
as
she
was
too
young
to
go
into
a
prison
and
desired
that
the
other
girl
should
be
remanded
in
order
to
have
some
of
the
pledged
goods
produced
the
father
was
committed
in
default
of
bail
for
receiving
stolen
goods
the
child
has
since
been
found
guilty
the
prosecutor
stated
that
the
family
consisted
of
five
children
one
of
whom
could
read
or
another
very
cruel
practice
of
these
young
delinquents
is
to
go
into
some
chandlers
shop
as
slily
as
possible
and
take
the
first
opportunity
of
stealing
the
till
with
its
contents
there
being
always
some
older
thief
ready
to
take
charge
of
it
as
soon
as
the
child
removes
it
from
the
shop
a
many
a
poor
woman
has
had
to
lament
the
loss
of
her
till
with
its
contents
taken
by
a
child
perhaps
scarcely
six
years
of
age
there
is
always
a
plan
laid
down
for
the
child
to
act
upon
should
he
be
unable
to
obtain
possession
of
the
till
himself
he
is
instructed
to
pretend
that
he
has
missed
his
way
and
to
inquire
for
some
street
near
the
spot
or
he
will
address
her
with
please
can
you
tell
me
what
it
is
the
unsuspecting
woman
with
the
greatest
kindness
possible
shews
the
child
the
street
he
inquires
for
or
leaves
the
shop
to
ascertain
the
hour
and
for
her
civility
she
is
sure
to
find
herself
robbed
when
she
returns
by
some
of
the
child
companions
should
he
be
detected
in
actual
possession
of
the
property
he
is
instructed
to
act
his
part
in
the
most
artful
manner
by
pretending
that
some
man
sent
him
into
the
shop
to
take
it
who
told
him
that
he
would
give
him
sixpence
to
buy
cakes
footnote
a
so
complete
is
the
science
of
pilfering
rendered
by
its
perpetrators
that
they
have
even
a
peculiar
vocabulary
of
their
own
rendering
their
conversation
to
those
who
may
chance
to
overhear
them
as
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
as
though
they
were
conversing
in
a
foreign
tongue
for
instance
the
scutcheons
they
steal
from
the
key
holes
are
called
brass
weights
while
purloining
the
contents
of
a
till
is
called
the
in
short
they
have
a
peculiar
name
for
almost
every
thing
it
is
not
uncommon
for
these
young
offenders
to
stop
children
whom
they
may
meet
in
the
street
unprotected
and
either
by
artifice
or
violence
take
from
them
their
hats
necklaces
thus
initiating
themselves
as
it
were
into
the
desperate
crime
of
assault
and
highway
robbery
young
as
the
subjects
of
the
foregoing
narrations
mostly
were
i
have
little
doubt
their
pupilage
commenced
at
a
much
earlier
age
they
could
not
otherwise
have
attained
so
much
proficiency
in
the
practice
of
crime
and
hardihood
on
detection
however
possible
it
maybe
thought
to
reclaim
children
of
so
tender
an
age
i
am
convinced
that
thieves
of
more
advanced
years
become
so
thoroughly
perverted
in
their
wills
and
understandings
as
to
be
incapable
of
perceiving
the
disgrace
of
their
conduct
or
the
enormity
of
the
offence
i
was
once
told
by
an
old
thief
that
thieving
was
his
profession
and
he
had
therefore
a
right
to
follow
it
and
i
could
plainly
discover
from
further
conversation
with
him
that
he
had
established
in
himself
an
opinion
that
thieving
was
no
harm
provided
he
used
no
violence
to
the
person
he
seemed
indeed
to
have
no
other
idea
of
the
rights
of
property
than
that
described
as
the
maxim
of
a
celebrated
scottish
outlaw
that
they
should
take
who
have
the
power
and
they
should
keep
who
can
when
this
most
lamentable
state
is
reached
it
is
to
be
feared
all
modes
of
punishment
as
correctives
are
useless
and
the
only
thing
left
is
to
prevent
further
depredation
by
banishment
the
incorrigibility
which
a
child
may
attain
who
has
once
associated
with
thieves
at
an
early
age
is
apparent
from
the
following
fact
richard
leworthy
aged
fourteen
was
indicted
for
stealing
five
sovereigns
the
property
of
william
newling
his
master
the
prosecutor
stated
that
he
resided
in
the
commercial
road
and
is
by
business
a
tailor
the
prisoner
had
been
his
apprentice
for
four
months
up
to
the
of
august
when
he
committed
the
robbery
on
that
day
he
gave
him
five
pounds
to
take
to
wells
of
bishopsgate
street
to
discharge
a
bill
he
never
went
nor
did
he
return
home
he
did
not
hear
of
him
for
three
weeks
when
he
found
him
at
windsor
and
apprehended
him
the
prisoner
admitted
having
applied
the
money
to
his
own
use
he
was
found
at
a
public
house
and
said
he
had
spent
all
his
money
except
one
shilling
and
six
pence
a
shopman
in
the
service
of
wells
stated
that
in
august
last
the
witness
owed
his
master
a
sum
of
money
he
knew
the
prisoner
he
did
not
bring
money
to
their
shop
either
on
or
since
the
of
august
the
prisoner
made
no
defence
but
called
his
master
who
said
he
received
him
from
the
refuge
for
the
destitute
and
had
a
good
character
with
him
he
would
not
take
him
back
again
wontner
stated
that
he
had
received
two
communications
from
the
rev
crosby
the
chaplain
of
the
institution
stating
they
would
not
interfere
on
his
behalf
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
justice
park
observed
that
the
best
course
would
be
to
send
him
out
of
the
country
here
we
see
that
notwithstanding
the
discipline
he
had
undergone
and
the
instructions
he
had
received
during
his
confinement
in
the
establishment
of
the
refuge
for
the
destitute
he
had
not
been
more
than
four
months
from
that
place
before
he
fell
into
his
old
habits
it
is
moreover
to
be
remarked
that
such
had
been
his
conduct
during
his
confinement
that
the
directors
of
the
establishment
thought
themselves
war
ranted
in
giving
a
good
character
with
him
they
were
probably
little
surprised
on
hearing
of
this
relapse
on
the
part
of
the
boy
experience
had
doubtless
taught
them
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
and
we
plainly
see
they
were
convinced
that
all
further
attempts
at
reclaiming
him
were
useless
the
facility
with
which
property
maybe
disposed
of
should
be
mentioned
as
a
powerful
inducement
to
crime
the
following
case
suggests
it
to
the
mind
thomas
jackson
a
mere
child
not
more
than
nine
years
of
age
was
charged
some
time
ago
at
the
town
hall
with
committing
a
burglary
on
the
premises
of
james
whitelock
a
master
builder
rents
thomas
southwark
whitelock
it
appears
resided
in
an
old
mansion
formerly
an
inn
which
he
had
divided
into
two
separate
tenements
occupying
one
part
himself
and
letting
the
other
to
the
parents
of
the
prisoner
in
this
division
he
had
deposited
building
materials
to
a
considerable
amount
one
hundred
weight
of
which
in
iron
holdfasts
hinges
nails
clamps
he
missed
one
day
on
entering
the
room
the
door
of
which
had
been
blocked
by
a
large
copper
and
the
partition
door
forced
the
character
of
the
prisoner
being
of
the
worst
description
he
was
apprehended
when
he
confessed
he
had
taken
all
the
property
and
disposed
of
it
to
a
woman
named
priscilla
fletcher
the
keeper
of
a
marine
store
james
street
the
receiver
who
is
last
of
the
family
that
has
not
been
either
hanged
or
refused
to
swear
to
the
prisoner
though
she
admitted
she
believed
he
was
the
person
she
bought
the
property
produced
from
at
the
rate
of
one
penny
for
each
three
pounds
it
was
proved
to
be
worth
three
per
pound
alderman
smith
regretted
that
the
deficiency
of
evidence
prevented
him
sending
the
young
delinquent
for
trial
and
thereby
rescuing
him
from
an
ignominious
death
and
told
priscilla
who
was
all
modesty
that
he
was
convinced
she
had
perjured
herself
and
not
to
exult
at
her
own
escape
from
transportation
a
reward
he
could
not
help
considering
she
richly
merited
and
which
in
due
season
she
would
doubtless
receive
the
hardened
child
laughed
during
the
hearing
and
on
being
sentenced
by
the
oath
of
the
officers
as
a
reputed
thief
spit
at
his
accuser
and
exclaimed
as
he
was
taken
from
the
bar
to
be
conveyed
to
brixton
is
this
all
i
torment
you
yet
to
add
one
more
case
i
may
state
that
at
the
exeter
sessions
some
time
since
two
children
were
convicted
who
it
is
believed
were
not
above
ten
years
of
age
previously
to
this
they
had
been
convicted
of
felony
and
had
suffered
six
months
imprisonment
at
bodmin
and
it
appears
that
two
years
before
they
started
alone
from
bristol
on
this
circuit
of
youthful
depredation
having
collected
the
foregoing
instances
of
juvenile
delinquency
and
presented
them
to
the
public
i
can
not
refrain
from
adducing
a
few
other
cases
which
came
under
my
own
observation
whilst
conducting
the
spitalfields
infant
school
several
instances
of
dishonesty
in
the
children
occurred
on
one
occasion
the
mother
herself
came
to
complain
of
a
little
boy
not
more
than
four
years
old
on
the
following
grounds
she
stated
that
being
obliged
to
be
out
at
work
all
day
as
well
as
her
husband
she
was
under
the
necessity
of
leaving
the
children
by
themselves
she
had
three
besides
the
little
boy
of
whom
she
was
complaining
having
to
pay
her
rent
she
put
for
that
purpose
in
a
cup
at
the
top
of
a
cupboard
on
stepping
home
to
give
the
children
their
dinners
she
found
the
boy
at
the
cupboard
mounted
on
a
chair
which
again
was
placed
on
the
top
of
a
table
on
looking
for
the
money
she
found
already
gone
one
penny
of
this
she
found
in
his
pocket
the
rest
he
had
divided
amongst
the
other
children
that
they
might
not
tell
of
him
after
this
relation
i
kept
a
strict
watch
on
the
child
and
three
or
four
days
afterwards
the
children
detected
him
opening
my
desk
and
taking
out
of
it
they
informed
me
of
this
and
while
they
were
bringing
him
up
to
me
the
dropped
out
of
his
hand
i
detected
him
in
many
other
very
bad
actions
but
have
reason
to
hope
that
by
suitable
discipline
and
instruction
he
was
effectually
cured
of
his
sad
propensities
about
the
same
time
i
observed
two
little
children
very
near
the
in
close
conversation
and
from
their
frequently
looking
at
a
that
was
near
i
felt
inclined
to
watch
them
having
previously
heard
from
some
of
the
pupils
that
they
had
frequently
seen
children
in
the
neighbourhood
steal
oysters
and
other
things
i
accordingly
placed
myself
in
a
convenient
situation
and
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
moment
they
saw
there
was
no
one
passing
they
went
up
to
the
stall
the
eldest
walking
alongside
the
other
apparently
to
prevent
his
being
seen
whilst
the
little
one
snatched
an
orange
and
conveyed
it
under
his
pinafore
with
all
the
dexterity
of
an
experienced
thief
the
youngest
of
these
children
was
not
four
years
old
and
the
eldest
apparently
not
above
five
there
was
reason
to
believe
this
was
not
the
first
time
they
had
been
guilty
of
stealing
though
perhaps
unknown
to
their
parents
as
i
have
found
to
be
the
case
in
other
instances
another
little
boy
in
the
school
whose
mother
kept
a
little
shop
frequently
brought
money
with
him
as
much
as
at
a
time
on
questioning
the
child
how
he
came
by
it
he
always
said
that
his
mother
gave
it
to
him
and
i
thought
there
was
no
reason
to
doubt
his
word
for
there
was
something
so
prepossessing
in
his
appearance
that
at
the
time
i
could
not
doubt
the
truth
of
his
story
but
finding
that
the
child
spent
a
great
deal
of
money
in
fruit
cakes
and
still
had
some
remaining
i
found
it
advisable
to
see
the
mother
and
to
my
astonishment
found
it
all
a
fiction
for
she
had
not
given
him
any
and
we
were
both
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
he
obtained
it
the
child
told
his
mother
gave
it
to
him
and
he
told
his
that
it
was
given
to
him
at
school
but
when
he
was
confronted
with
us
both
not
a
word
would
he
say
it
was
evident
therefore
that
he
had
obtained
it
by
some
unfair
means
and
we
both
determined
to
suspend
our
judgment
and
to
keep
a
strict
eye
on
him
in
future
nothing
however
transpired
for
some
time
i
followed
him
home
several
times
but
saw
nothing
amiss
at
length
i
received
notice
from
the
mother
that
she
had
detected
taking
money
out
of
the
till
in
her
little
shop
it
then
came
out
that
there
was
some
boy
in
the
neighbourhood
who
acted
as
banker
to
him
and
for
every
two
pence
which
he
received
he
was
allowed
one
penny
for
taking
care
of
it
it
seems
that
the
child
was
afraid
to
bring
any
more
money
to
school
on
account
of
being
so
closely
questioned
as
to
where
he
obtained
it
and
this
probably
induced
him
to
give
more
to
the
boy
than
he
otherwise
would
have
done
suffice
it
however
to
say
that
both
children
at
length
were
found
out
and
the
mother
declared
that
the
child
conducted
her
to
some
old
boards
in
the
and
underneath
them
there
was
upwards
of
a
shilling
which
he
had
pilfered
at
various
times
the
reader
may
remember
too
that
during
the
autumn
of
a
boy
of
committed
and
that
another
of
the
same
age
was
convicted
of
the
dreadful
crime
of
it
appears
he
knew
a
boy
a
little
younger
than
himself
who
was
going
to
a
distance
with
some
money
and
having
taken
a
with
him
he
him
and
threatened
to
murder
him
the
poor
little
victim
kneeled
down
offered
him
his
money
his
knife
and
all
he
had
and
said
he
would
love
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
if
he
would
spare
him
and
never
tell
what
had
happened
but
the
pathetic
and
forcible
appeal
which
would
have
melted
many
a
was
vain
the
little
monster
stabbed
him
in
the
throat
and
then
robbed
him
on
his
trial
he
discovered
no
feeling
and
he
even
heard
his
sentence
with
the
utmost
indifference
and
without
a
tear
it
would
have
been
easy
to
multiply
cases
of
juvenile
delinquency
both
those
which
have
been
brought
under
the
cognizance
of
the
law
and
those
which
have
come
to
my
own
knowledge
but
i
think
enough
has
been
related
to
shew
how
early
children
may
and
do
become
depraved
i
have
purposely
given
most
of
them
with
as
few
remarks
of
my
own
as
possible
that
they
may
plead
their
own
cause
with
the
reader
and
excite
a
desire
in
his
bosom
to
enter
with
me
in
the
next
chapter
on
an
inquiry
into
the
causes
of
such
early
depravity
since
the
above
incidents
and
facts
were
observed
and
reports
from
the
public
prints
were
recorded
general
attention
has
been
drawn
more
fully
to
the
very
great
increase
of
ignorance
demoralization
and
crime
amongst
the
lower
classes
both
old
and
young
these
things
call
on
us
most
loudly
for
active
effort
and
exertion
and
it
becomes
the
patriot
and
philanthropist
but
especially
the
christian
to
look
around
to
think
and
to
consider
what
effectual
means
may
be
found
and
what
efficient
plans
may
be
adopted
to
strike
the
evil
fatally
at
its
roots
and
cause
it
to
wither
away
if
these
things
be
not
done
the
moral
pestilence
must
increase
and
eventually
deprive
us
of
all
that
is
dear
to
us
as
men
and
citizens

they
go
what

then
can
their

know
appalling
as
the
of

are
i
think
we
may
discover
a

them
in
the
present
condition

habits
of
the
adult
part

the
labouring
classes

shall
find
very
frequently

only
natural
produce

by
the
infallible

do
not

assert
that
the

actually
encourage
their

in
the
commission
of
theft
we
may
indeed
fear
that
some
do
as
in
the
instance
of
the
two
little
girls
detected
in
whose
case
was
detailed
in
the
preceding
chapter
but
still
i
should
hope
that
such
facts
are
not
frequent
if
however
they
do
not
give
them
positive
encouragement
in
pilfering
the
example
they
set
is
often
calculated
to
deprave
the
heart
of
the
child
and
amongst
other
evil
consequences
to
induce
dishonesty
whilst
in
other
cases
we
find
that
from
peculiar
circumstances
the
child
is
deprived
during
the
whole
day
of
the
controling
presence
of
a
parent
and
is
exposed
to
all
the
poisonous
contamination
which
the
streets
of
large
cities
afford
and
hence
appears
another
cause
of
evil
here
children
come
in
contact
with
maturer
vice
and
are
often
drawn
by
its
influence
from
the
paths
of
innocence
as
we
have
already
seen
in
many
instances
what
resistance
can
the
infant
make
to
the
insidious
serpents
which
thus
as
it
were
steal
into
its
cradle
and
infuse
their
poison
into
its
soul
the
guardians
of
its
helplessness
are
heedless
or
unconscious
of
its
danger
and
alas
it
has
not
the
fabled
strength
of
the
infant
hercules
to
crush
its
venomous
assailants
surely
such
a
view
of
the
frequent
origin
of
crime
must
awaken
our
commiseration
for
its
miserable
victims
and
excite
in
us
a
desire
to
become
the
defenders
of
the
unprotected
it
will
however
be
said
by
some
where
are
the
natural
guardians
of
the
child
where
are
its
parents
are
we
to
encourage
their
neglect
of
duty
by
becoming
their
substitutes
it
is
their
business
to
look
after
their
children
and
not
ours
frequently
have
i
heard
such
sentiments
put
forth
and
sometimes
by
persons
in
whom
i
knew
they
were
rather
owing
to
a
want
of
reflection
than
of
philanthropy
but
a
want
of
thought
or
of
feeling
it
must
certainly
be
because
on
no
principle
of
reason
or
humanity
can
we
make
the
unnatural
conduct
of
fathers
and
mothers
a
plea
for
withholding
our
protection
and
assistance
from
the
helpless
objects
of
their
cruelty
and
neglect
if
we
do
so
we
not
only
neglect
our
duty
towards
such
children
but
permit
the
growth
and
extension
of
the
evil
we
must
recollect
that
they
will
not
merely
play
their
own
wicked
parts
during
their
lives
but
will
also
become
models
to
the
next
generation
it
should
be
remembered
here
that
i
am
treating
of
an
evil
which
extends
itself
to
all
classes
of
society
i
am
appealing
to
the
prudence
of
men
that
they
may
for
their
own
sakes
investigate
its
cause
i
shall
hereafter
appeal
to
them
as
philanthropists
and
still
more
urgently
as
christians
that
they
may
examine
the
merits
of
the
remedy
i
shall
propose
the
culpability
of
many
parents
is
beyond
dispute
they
not
only
omit
to
set
their
children
good
examples
and
give
them
good
advice
but
on
the
contrary
instil
into
their
minds
the
first
rudiments
of
wickedness
and
lead
them
into
the
paths
of
vice
their
homes
present
scenes
which
human
nature
shudders
at
and
which
it
is
impossible
truly
to
describe
there
are
parents
who
working
at
home
have
every
opportunity
of
training
up
their
children
in
the
way
they
should
go
if
they
were
inclined
so
to
do
instead
of
this
we
often
find
in
the
case
of
the
fathers
that
they
are
so
lost
to
every
principle
of
humanity
that
as
soon
as
they
receive
their
wages
they
leave
their
homes
and
hasten
with
eager
steps
to
the
public
house
nor
do
they
its
accursed
threshold
till
the
landlord
has
received
the
greater
part
of
the
money
which
should
support
their
wives
and
children
and
till
they
have
qualified
themselves
by
intoxication
to
act
worse
than
brutes
on
their
return
home
to
men
of
this
description
it
matters
not
whether
or
not
their
children
are
proving
themselves
skilful
imitators
of
their
evil
example
they
may
curse
and
swear
lie
and
steal
so
long
as
they
can
enjoy
the
society
of
their
pot
companions
it
is
to
them
a
matter
of
total
indifference
during
my
superintendence
of
the
first
school
i
had
a
painful
facility
of
examining
these
matters
frequently
when
i
have
inquired
the
cause
of
the
wretched
plight
in
which
some
of
the
children
were
sent
to
the
school
perhaps
with
scarcely
a
shoe
to
their
feet
sometimes
altogether
without
i
have
heard
from
their
mothers
the
most
recitals
of
the
husband
misconduct
one
family
in
particular
i
remember
consisting
of
seven
children
two
of
whom
were
in
the
school
four
of
them
were
supported
entirely
by
the
exertions
of
the
mother
who
declared
to
me
that
she
did
not
receive
a
shilling
from
their
father
for
a
month
together
all
the
money
he
got
he
kept
to
spend
at
the
and
his
family
for
what
he
cared
might
go
naked
or
starve
he
was
not
only
a
great
drunkard
but
a
reprobate
into
the
bargain
beating
and
abusing
the
poor
woman
who
thus
endeavoured
to
support
his
children
by
her
labour
the
evil
does
not
always
stop
here
driven
to
the
extreme
of
wretchedness
by
her
husband
conduct
the
woman
sometimes
takes
to
drinking
likewise
and
the
poor
babes
are
ten
thousand
times
more
pitiable
than
orphans
i
have
witnessed
the
revolting
sight
of
a
child
leading
home
both
father
and
mother
from
the
in
a
disgusting
state
of
intoxication
with
tears
and
entreaties
i
have
seen
the
poor
infant
vainly
endeavouring
to
restrain
them
from
increasing
their
drunkenness
by
going
into
the
houses
on
their
way
home
they
have
shaken
off
the
clinging
child
who
in
the
greatest
anxiety
waited
without
to
resume
its
painful
task
knowing
all
the
time
perhaps
that
whilst
its
parents
were
thus
throwing
away
their
money
there
was
not
so
much
as
a
crust
of
bread
to
appease
its
hunger
at
home
let
it
not
be
thought
that
this
is
an
overcharged
picture
of
facts
it
is
but
a
faint
a
very
faint
and
imperfect
sketch
of
reality
which
defies
exaggeration
cases
of
such
depravity
on
the
part
of
mothers
i
with
much
pleasure
confess
to
be
comparatively
rare
maternal
affection
is
the
preventive
but
what
let
me
ask
can
be
hoped
of
the
children
of
such
parents
what
are
their
characters
likely
to
become
under
such
tuition
with
such
examples
before
their
eyes
need
they
leave
their
homes
to
seek
contamination
or
to
learn
to
do
evil
and
here
i
must
say
if
i
were
asked
to
point
out
in
the
metropolis
or
any
large
city
the
greatest
nuisance
the
worst
bane
of
society
the
most
successful
promoter
of
vice
i
should
without
a
hesitation
point
to
the
first
or
spirit
that
met
my
view
nor
can
i
in
speaking
of
the
causes
of
juvenile
delinquency
omit
to
say
i
think
these
houses
indirectly
a
very
great
cause
of
it
why
i
think
so
my
readers
will
readily
conceive
from
what
i
have
already
said
i
am
sure
that
satan
has
no
temple
in
which
he
is
so
devoutly
worshiped
or
so
highly
honoured
as
the
no
priest
is
so
devoted
as
its
landlord
no
followers
are
so
zealous
in
his
behalf
as
its
frequenters
let
any
one
in
the
evening
visit
the
homes
of
the
labouring
class
in
a
poor
neighbourhood
and
he
will
find
in
many
cases
a
room
a
numerous
family
of
small
children
perhaps
forgetting
the
pangs
of
hunger
in
the
obliviousness
of
sleep
a
wife
with
features
sitting
in
solitary
wretchedness
ruminating
on
wants
she
knows
not
how
to
supply
namely
clothes
and
food
for
her
children
on
the
morrow
and
on
debts
which
she
has
no
means
of
discharging
but
where
is
he
who
should
be
sharing
her
cares
bidding
her
be
of
good
cheer
and
devising
with
her
some
means
of
alleviating
their
mutual
distress
where
is
the
father
of
the
sleeping
babes
the
husband
of
the
watchful
wife
go
to
the
you
will
see
him
there
with
a
host
of
his
companions
of
like
character
and
circumstances
smoking
drinking
singing
blaspheming
gambling
ruining
his
health
spending
his
money
as
jovial
as
though
he
had
no
wretched
wife
no
starving
babes
at
home
and
as
lavish
of
money
which
should
procure
them
food
as
the
man
who
is
thriving
on
his
excesses
could
wish
him
to
be
i
never
look
on
a
without
considering
it
as
the
abode
of
the
evil
genius
of
the
neighbourhood
the
despoiler
of
industry
the
destroyer
of
domestic
comfort
and
heartily
do
i
wish
that
some
means
could
be
devised
for
abolishing
these
resorts
of
wickedness
that
some
legislative
enactment
may
render
it
unlawful
for
any
one
to
keep
such
places
with
respect
to
a
peculiar
sort
of
beverage
it
has
been
declared
to
be
illegal
to
afford
its
purchasers
accommodation
for
drinking
it
on
the
premises
why
not
extend
it
to
other
liquors
i
know
this
would
be
pronounced
an
infringement
on
english
liberty
the
worst
of
men
would
raise
this
outcry
against
the
measure
but
surely
it
should
rather
be
called
a
preventive
of
english
licentiousness
all
good
men
would
consider
it
as
such
i
would
not
rob
the
labourer
of
his
daily
allowance
of
a
beverage
which
is
believed
by
many
to
be
of
essential
service
when
taken
in
moderation
but
i
would
have
him
drink
it
at
home
that
his
wife
and
children
may
participate
in
his
enjoyment
perhaps
it
will
be
said
a
man
closely
confined
to
labour
all
day
needs
some
relaxation
from
domestic
cares
that
this
can
only
be
found
in
change
of
scene
and
in
social
company
i
will
concede
this
the
plea
of
health
though
often
speciously
advanced
can
not
be
denied
but
is
it
necessary
for
his
health
that
this
change
of
scene
should
be
found
in
a
close
within
a
few
yards
of
his
home
where
he
drinks
to
a
ruinous
excess
till
a
late
hour
breathing
all
the
while
a
hot
atmosphere
of
is
it
not
possible
to
obtain
the
change
of
scene
and
the
relaxation
of
social
converse
by
mutual
visits
amongst
friends
similarly
situated
by
a
ramble
to
the
suburbs
or
in
cases
where
the
daily
occupation
affords
too
little
opportunity
for
exercise
are
there
not
places
established
for
gymnastic
exercises
and
might
not
others
be
formed
for
the
like
purposes
certain
i
am
that
the
abolition
of
in
large
cities
as
places
of
daily
resort
for
the
adult
labouring
poor
would
be
attended
with
the
most
salutary
consequences
i
know
of
nothing
that
must
so
certainly
tend
to
their
improvement
both
in
character
and
circumstances
no
man
can
witness
the
scenes
and
doings
of
many
persons
who
attend
the
new
without
pain
and
regret
that
ever
an
act
of
parliament
was
passed
to
legalize
such
places
i
have
visited
some
hundreds
of
such
throughout
the
country
and
can
positively
assert
that
the
demoralising
tendency
of
too
many
is
awful
our
magistrates
must
be
more
careful
in
granting
licences
or
the
efforts
of
the
wise
and
good
will
be
neutralized
by
the
evils
concocted
at
such
places
the
old
inkeepers
had
a
character
and
capital
at
stake
the
new
i
should
say
a
majority
of
them
at
least
have
neither
and
consequently
are
less
cautious
having
less
to
lose
whatever
the
end
of
the
legislature
might
have
been
in
enabling
the
poor
to
procure
a
good
and
cheap
article
more
easily
to
be
drunk
on
or
off
the
premises
the
thing
has
not
answered
the
end
and
no
one
can
deny
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
visit
such
places
in
different
counties
that
the
has
been
a
miserable
failure
and
has
been
the
fruitful
source
of
crime
and
immorality
what
a
lesson
is
this
for
speculative
short
sighted
legislators
another
measure
should
then
be
adopted
i
would
say
destroy
the
facility
of
by
laying
on
a
heavy
duty
it
is
in
vain
that
interested
sophistry
would
plead
its
benefits
in
particular
cases
such
for
instance
as
the
ludicrous
plea
of
the
needfulness
of
drams
for
on
wet
and
frosty
mornings
a
set
these
specious
benefits
against
the
dreadful
results
to
men
health
and
pockets
from
the
present
low
price
of
spirits
and
their
consequent
enormous
consumption
and
then
let
common
sense
and
honesty
deliver
its
judgment
i
have
spoken
thus
candidly
and
at
length
upon
the
subject
in
the
present
chapter
though
somewhat
out
of
place
because
my
feelings
would
not
allow
me
to
be
less
plain
or
more
brief
or
to
postpone
the
matter
to
a
more
convenient
season
perhaps
in
talking
of
legislative
alterations
i
have
been
wandering
upon
forbidden
ground
if
so
in
returning
to
my
proper
path
i
will
comfort
myself
with
this
thought
the
progress
of
improvement
however
slow
is
sure
and
it
is
certainly
advancing
in
this
country
i
require
no
other
assurance
than
the
establishment
of
infant
schools
and
mechanic
footnote
a
some
conception
of
the
fearful
height
which
drunkenness
has
attained
may
be
gathered
from
the
fact
that
in
the
quantity
of
distilled
spirits
on
which
the
duty
was
paid
in
the
three
kingdoms
amounted
to
of
gallons
to
form
a
due
estimate
however
of
the
actual
consumption
an
immense
quantity
must
be
added
obtained
by
smuggling
of
the
rum
imported
for
home
consumption
allowing
for
that
the
quantity
was
of
gallons
of
brandy
and
other
articles
imported
gallons
making
a
total
with
the
omission
of
all
on
which
the
duty
was
evaded
of
of
gallons
of
ardent
spirits
consumed
in
the
year
five
millions
of
revenue
grew
out
of
this
but
it
cost
the
people
sterling
a
which
would
have
paid
interest
of
the
national
debt
no
person
says
sir
astley
cooper
has
greater
hostility
to
dram
drinking
than
myself
insomuch
that
i
never
suffer
any
ardent
spirits
in
my
house
thinking
evil
spirits
and
if
the
poor
could
witness
the
white
livers
the
dropsies
the
shattered
nervous
systems
which
i
love
seen
as
the
consequence
of
drinking
they
would
be
aware
that
and
were
synonymous
terms
institutions
it
advance
and
what
the
legislature
may
never
be
able
to
accomplish
the
spirit
of
improvement
eventually
will
but
having
considered
those
cases
in
which
wilful
neglect
and
bad
example
may
be
charged
upon
the
parents
we
should
not
forget
to
tell
those
who
object
to
our
interference
in
the
duty
of
a
child
natural
protectors
that
it
is
not
in
every
instance
from
neglect
on
their
part
that
their
children
are
left
unprotected
in
the
streets
the
circumstances
of
the
labouring
classes
are
such
in
many
cases
that
they
are
compelled
to
leave
their
children
either
wholly
unprotected
or
in
the
charge
of
some
one
who
frequently
becomes
a
betrayer
instead
of
a
defender
the
father
perhaps
goes
to
his
daily
labour
in
the
morning
before
the
children
are
out
of
bed
and
does
not
return
till
they
are
in
bed
again
at
night
the
mother
goes
out
in
like
manner
the
earnings
of
the
husband
being
insufficient
for
the
maintenance
of
the
family
and
the
children
are
intrusted
throughout
the
day
to
the
care
of
some
girl
whose
parents
are
as
poor
as
themselves
and
are
glad
to
let
her
earn
something
towards
her
support
numbers
of
little
girls
thus
go
out
before
they
are
twelve
years
old
and
teach
the
little
children
all
they
know
commonly
to
be
deceitful
and
not
unfrequently
to
be
dishonest
the
parents
careless
or
unsuspecting
only
make
inquiry
when
they
return
home
if
the
children
have
been
good
and
quiet
and
of
course
receive
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
the
evil
consequences
begin
to
show
themselves
and
then
the
good
folks
wonder
how
or
when
the
seeds
of
such
depravity
could
have
been
sown
many
i
know
will
be
inclined
to
smile
at
the
insignificancy
of
the
cause
pointed
out
i
can
only
say
it
is
from
such
springs
however
regarded
that
the
great
stream
of
vice
is
supplied
and
what
we
laugh
at
now
for
its
insignificant
origin
will
hereafter
in
its
maturity
laugh
at
us
for
our
impotence
in
vainly
endeavouring
to
stem
it
what
are
parents
to
do
with
their
children
situated
as
those
are
of
whom
we
have
just
spoken
and
very
many
are
so
situated
is
it
possible
for
them
to
perform
their
duty
as
protectors
of
their
children
it
requires
all
their
time
to
labour
for
their
support
and
they
therefore
leave
them
unavoidably
either
in
such
hands
as
we
have
described
or
to
take
care
of
themselves
to
range
the
streets
and
form
such
associations
as
may
there
happen
to
fall
in
their
way
they
get
into
company
with
older
delinquents
and
become
first
their
instruments
and
then
their
associates
till
at
length
they
find
their
way
into
a
gaol
this
is
no
delusive
way
of
accounting
for
the
matter
it
is
a
solution
which
experience
and
observation
have
taught
and
established
i
have
traced
the
progress
of
delinquency
in
actual
life
from
its
earliest
stages
from
the
little
trembling
pilferer
of
the
not
more
than
four
or
five
years
old
to
the
confirmed
thief
of
nine
or
ten
years
who
had
been
in
gaol
three
or
four
times
and
was
as
proud
of
his
dexterity
in
thieving
and
hardihood
under
punishment
as
he
could
have
been
of
the
most
virtuous
accomplishment
or
the
most
becoming
fortitude
the
infant
thief
conscious
of
shame
and
trembling
with
fear
will
tell
you
on
detection
that
tommy
or
billy
some
older
associate
set
him
to
do
it
you
let
him
go
he
joins
his
companions
who
laugh
at
the
story
he
tells
ridicule
him
for
his
fears
praise
him
for
his
dexterity
and
rejoice
in
his
escape
it
will
be
very
easy
to
imagine
how
under
a
course
of
such
treatment
the
young
offender
so
soon
dismisses
both
shame
and
fear
and
learns
to
forget
everything
but
the
gain
and
glory
of
his
crimes
it
is
no
small
matter
of
credit
with
older
thieves
by
older
thieves
i
still
mean
boys
of
nine
or
ten
years
old
to
have
under
their
tuition
two
or
three
pupils
i
have
seen
in
my
walks
as
many
as
seven
or
eight
sallying
forth
from
the
alleys
in
the
neighbourhood
of
spitalfields
under
the
command
as
it
were
of
a
leader
a
boy
perhaps
not
more
than
nine
or
ten
years
old
i
have
watched
their
plans
and
have
noticed
that
it
was
usual
to
send
first
the
youngest
boy
to
attempt
the
theft
perhaps
the
object
to
be
obtained
was
only
a
bun
from
the
open
window
of
a
shop
if
he
failed
another
was
sent
whilst
the
rest
were
lurking
at
the
corner
of
some
court
ready
to
flee
in
case
their
companion
was
detected
and
i
have
sometimes
seen
that
after
all
the
rest
had
failed
either
from
want
of
skill
or
the
too
great
vigilance
of
the
the
boy
who
acted
as
leader
has
started
out
and
by
a
display
of
superior
dexterity
would
have
carried
off
the
prize
had
it
not
happened
that
some
one
was
thus
purposely
watching
his
conduct
when
detected
if
an
old
offender
he
will
either
look
you
in
tire
face
with
the
greatest
effrontery
and
an
expression
of
defiance
or
he
will
feign
to
cry
and
tell
you
he
was
hungry
has
no
father
nor
mother
though
frequently
on
further
inquiry
i
have
found
the
whole
story
to
be
false
alas
there
is
class
of
children
with
whom
i
know
not
how
to
deal
i
mean
those
without
the
natural
protectors
the
man
can
for
a
more
trifle
get
rid
of
all
responsibility
though
in
general
most
able
to
bear
it
the
woman
has
the
dead
weight
which
often
proves
the
destruction
of
her
offspring
and
herself
suicide
and
murder
are
the
frequently
to
her
but
she
loves
her
offspring
and
perhaps
he
who
deceived
her
and
for
both
their
sakes
fights
the
battle
against
fearful
odds
for
a
few
years
at
least
she
will
not
last
long
at
length
she
sinks
she
dies
where
oh
where
is
the
guardian
for
her
child
reader
there
are
many
thousands
of
such
what
becomes
of
them
but
there
are
other
mothers
of
this
class
more
ignorant
have
less
of
feeling
no
education
no
training
they
advance
from
bad
to
worse
until
they
have
five
or
six
children
here
are
circumstances
for
children
to
come
into
the
world
grievously
against
them
what
becomes
of
these
to
avoid
painful
details
i
will
answer
the
question
they
become
a
pest
to
society
each
a
demoralizer
of
others
living
upon
the
public
as
tramps
begging
impostors
thieves
teachers
of
thieves
and
the
country
more
than
five
times
their
number
born
under
other
and
better
god
grant
that
spiritual
light
philosophical
light
and
scientific
light
united
may
enable
us
to
find
the
remedy
the
two
grand
causes
of
juvenile
delinquency
we
have
seen
then
to
be
the
evil
example
of
parents
themselves
and
the
bad
associations
which
children
form
at
an
early
age
when
through
neglect
they
are
suffered
to
be
in
the
streets
in
the
first
instance
the
parents
of
the
children
are
wholly
without
excuse
in
the
second
though
in
some
cases
we
may
blame
them
in
others
we
can
not
justly
do
so
but
must
admit
as
an
exculpation
the
unfortunate
circumstances
of
their
condition
in
life
it
would
be
easy
to
shew
by
a
multitude
of
instances
the
evil
effects
produced
on
children
of
a
tender
age
by
street
associations
but
i
think
enough
has
been
said
to
convince
every
reflecting
mind
that
it
is
highly
necessary
that
we
should
interfere
in
behalf
of
children
so
situated
and
i
shall
conclude
the
present
chapter
by
some
remarks
on
the
various
habits
and
practices
of
the
poor
classes
which
have
at
least
an
injurious
tendency
on
the
character
of
the
rising
generation
as
children
are
such
imitative
beings
i
can
not
help
making
a
few
observations
on
the
tricks
which
are
usually
introduced
into
our
it
is
well
known
that
those
of
the
clown
form
a
principal
part
of
the
entertainment
it
is
also
equally
well
known
that
the
pantomimes
are
particularly
designed
to
amuse
children
for
which
reason
they
are
generally
represented
during
the
christmas
holidays
if
however
they
were
merely
intended
to
them
they
who
have
introduced
them
have
perhaps
gained
their
object
but
what
kind
of
they
afford
i
shall
here
attempt
to
shew
i
do
not
recollect
to
have
seen
a
pantomime
myself
without
being
introduced
under
every
possible
form
such
as
shop
lifting
picking
pockets
can
it
then
be
for
a
moment
supposed
improbable
that
children
after
having
witnessed
these
exhibitions
should
endeavour
to
put
the
thing
into
practice
whenever
an
opportunity
offers
and
try
whether
they
can
not
take
a
handkerchief
from
a
gentleman
pocket
with
the
same
ease
and
dexterity
as
the
clown
in
the
play
did
or
if
unsuccessful
in
this
part
of
the
business
that
they
should
try
their
prowess
in
carrying
off
a
shoulder
of
mutton
from
a
butcher
shop
a
loaf
from
a
baker
or
lighter
articles
from
the
fruiterer
or
for
having
seen
the
dexterity
of
the
clown
in
these
cases
they
will
not
be
at
a
loss
for
methods
to
accomplish
by
sleight
of
hand
their
several
purposes
in
my
humble
opinion
children
can
not
go
to
a
better
place
for
instruction
in
these
matters
or
to
a
place
more
calculated
to
teach
them
the
art
of
pilfering
to
perfection
than
to
the
theatre
when
pantomimes
are
performed
to
say
that
the
persons
who
write
and
introduce
these
pieces
are
in
want
of
may
not
be
true
but
i
must
charge
them
with
a
want
of
sufficient
thought
right
feeling
and
principle
in
not
calculating
on
their
baneful
effects
on
the
rising
generation
for
whose
amusement
it
appears
they
are
chiefly
produced
many
unfortunate
persons
who
have
heard
sentence
of
death
passed
upon
them
or
who
are
now
suffering
under
the
law
in
various
ways
have
had
to
lament
that
the
seeds
of
vice
were
sown
in
their
minds
while
viewing
the
pilfering
tricks
of
clowns
in
alas
too
little
do
we
calculate
on
the
direful
effects
of
this
species
of
amusement
on
the
future
character
of
the
young
we
first
permit
their
minds
to
be
poisoned
by
offering
them
the
draught
and
then
punish
them
by
law
for
taking
it
does
not
the
wide
world
afford
a
variety
of
materials
sufficient
for
virtuous
imitation
without
descending
to
that
which
is
vicious
it
is
much
easier
to
make
a
pail
of
pure
water
foul
than
it
is
to
make
a
pail
of
foul
water
pure
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
wish
to
sweep
off
every
kind
of
amusement
from
the
juvenile
part
of
society
but
i
do
wish
to
sweep
off
all
that
has
a
pernicious
tendency
the
limits
which
i
have
prescribed
to
myself
will
not
allow
me
to
enter
more
at
large
into
this
subject
otherwise
i
could
produce
a
number
of
facts
which
would
prove
most
unquestionably
the
propriety
of
discontinuing
these
exhibitions
a
conversation
which
i
once
heard
between
some
boys
who
were
playing
at
what
is
called
will
prove
the
truth
of
my
assertions
bill
said
one
of
the
boys
to
the
other
when
did
you
go
to
the
play
last
on
monday
night
was
the
reply
did
you
see
the
new
pantomime
yes
well
did
you
see
any
fun
yes
i
believe
i
did
too
i
saw
the
clown
a
whole
of
sausages
and
put
them
into
his
pocket
and
then
pour
the
gravy
in
after
them
you
would
have
split
your
sides
with
laughing
had
you
been
there
and
were
with
me
and
they
laughed
as
much
as
i
did
and
what
do
you
think
did
the
next
night
how
should
i
know
why
replied
the
other
he
and
about
two
pounds
of
sausages
from
a
pork
shop
and
we
had
them
for
supper
this
conversation
i
heard
from
a
window
which
looked
into
a
ruinous
place
where
boys
assembled
to
toss
up
for
money
and
other
games
this
fact
alone
without
recording
any
more
is
sufficient
to
show
the
evil
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
and
i
do
most
sincerely
hope
that
those
persons
who
have
any
influence
over
the
stage
will
use
their
utmost
endeavours
speedily
to
expunge
every
thing
thus
calculated
to
promote
evil
inclinations
in
the
minds
of
children
and
vicious
habits
in
the
lives
of
men
it
is
not
impossible
that
scenic
exhibitions
might
be
made
a
most
powerful
means
of
instruction
to
the
young
and
tend
to
promote
virtue
and
happiness
as
well
as
be
a
means
of
rational
amusement
but
as
they
now
exist
their
extirpation
is
desirable
as
i
have
had
much
experience
from
being
brought
up
in
london
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
the
evil
impressions
and
dangerous
temptations
that
the
children
of
the
poor
are
liable
to
fall
into
and
therefore
most
solemnly
affirm
that
nothing
in
my
view
would
give
so
much
happiness
to
the
community
at
large
as
the
taking
care
of
the
affections
of
the
infant
children
of
the
poor
there
is
moreover
a
practice
very
prevalent
among
the
poor
which
does
greater
mischief
than
the
people
are
generally
aware
of
and
that
is
sending
their
children
to
the
it
is
well
known
that
many
persons
send
children
scarcely
seven
years
of
age
to
these
people
with
pledges
of
various
sorts
a
thing
that
can
not
be
too
severely
condemned
i
know
an
instance
of
a
little
boy
finding
a
shawl
in
the
street
and
being
in
the
habit
of
going
to
the
for
his
mother
instead
of
taking
the
shawl
home
to
his
parents
he
actually
pawned
it
and
spent
all
the
money
which
might
never
have
been
known
by
his
parents
had
not
the
mother
found
the
duplicate
in
his
pocket
it
is
evident
then
that
many
parents
have
no
one
but
themselves
to
blame
for
the
misconduct
of
their
children
for
had
this
child
not
been
accustomed
to
go
to
such
a
place
his
he
would
never
have
thought
of
going
there
and
the
shawl
most
likely
would
have
been
carried
home
to
indeed
there
is
no
knowing
where
such
a
system
will
end
for
if
the
children
are
suffered
to
go
to
such
places
they
may
in
time
pledge
that
which
does
not
belong
to
them
and
so
easy
is
the
way
of
turning
any
article
into
money
that
we
find
most
young
thieves
of
both
sexes
when
apprehended
have
some
duplicates
about
them
those
persons
therefore
who
take
pledges
of
children
contrary
to
the
act
of
parliament
whether
they
know
it
or
not
ought
to
be
severely
reprimanded
for
i
am
persuaded
that
such
conduct
is
productive
of
very
great
mischief
indeed
taking
children
to
is
another
thing
which
is
also
productive
of
much
harm
at
the
commencement
of
the
first
school
seventy
or
eighty
children
were
frequently
absent
whenever
there
was
a
fair
near
london
but
the
parents
were
afterwards
cured
of
this
and
we
seldom
had
above
twenty
absentees
at
several
of
the
children
have
told
me
that
their
parents
wished
to
take
them
but
they
requested
to
be
permitted
to
come
to
school
instead
indeed
the
parents
finding
that
they
can
enjoy
themselves
better
without
their
children
are
very
willing
to
leave
them
at
school
it
is
a
difficult
matter
to
persuade
grown
persons
of
the
impropriety
of
attending
fairs
who
have
been
accustomed
to
it
when
children
but
children
are
easily
persuaded
from
it
for
if
they
are
properly
entertained
at
school
they
will
not
have
the
least
desire
to
go
to
such
places
i
can
not
quit
this
subject
without
relating
one
or
two
more
very
bad
habits
to
which
children
are
addicted
and
which
are
perhaps
fit
subjects
for
the
consideration
of
the
as
it
is
the
object
of
that
society
to
clear
the
streets
of
beggars
it
would
be
well
if
they
would
put
a
stop
to
those
juvenile
beggars
many
of
whom
are
children
of
respectable
parents
who
assemble
together
to
build
what
they
call
a
grotto
to
the
great
annoyance
of
all
passengers
in
the
street
however
desirous
persons
may
be
of
encouraging
ingenuity
in
children
i
think
it
is
doing
them
much
harm
to
give
them
money
when
they
ask
for
it
in
this
way
indeed
it
would
appear
that
some
of
the
children
have
learned
the
art
of
begging
so
well
that
they
are
able
to
vie
with
the
most
experienced
mendicants
ladies
in
particular
are
very
much
annoyed
by
children
getting
before
them
and
asking
for
money
nor
will
they
take
the
answer
given
them
but
put
their
hats
up
to
the
ladies
faces
saying
please
remember
the
grotto
and
when
told
by
the
parties
that
they
have
no
money
to
give
they
will
still
continue
to
follow
and
be
as
importunate
as
any
common
beggar
however
innocent
and
trifling
this
may
appear
to
some
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
such
practices
tend
to
evil
for
they
teach
children
to
be
mean
and
may
cause
some
of
them
to
choose
begging
rather
than
work
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
stop
this
species
of
begging
is
never
to
give
them
any
thing
a
fact
which
came
under
my
own
observation
will
shew
that
the
practice
may
be
productive
of
mischief
a
foreign
gentleman
walking
up
old
street
road
was
surrounded
by
three
or
four
boys
saying
please
sir
remember
the
grotto
go
away
was
the
reply
i
will
give
you
none
to
this
followed
do
pray
sir
remember
the
grotto
no
i
tell
you
i
will
give
you
nothing
do
sir
only
once
at
length
i
believe
he
put
something
into
one
of
their
hats
and
thus
got
rid
of
them
but
he
had
scarcely
gone
yards
before
he
came
to
another
grotto
and
out
sallied
three
more
boys
with
the
same
importunate
request
he
replied
i
will
give
you
nothing
plague
have
you
and
your
grotto
the
boys
however
persevered
till
the
gentleman
having
lost
all
patience
gave
one
of
them
a
gentle
tap
to
get
out
of
the
way
but
the
boy
being
on
the
side
of
the
fell
into
the
mud
which
had
been
scraped
off
the
road
and
in
this
pickle
followed
the
gentleman
bellowing
out
that
man
knocked
me
down
in
the
mud
and
i
had
done
nothing
to
him
in
consequence
a
number
of
persons
soon
collected
who
insulted
the
gentleman
very
much
and
he
would
certainly
have
been
roughly
handled
had
he
not
given
the
boy
something
as
a
recompence
he
then
called
a
coach
declaring
he
could
not
walk
the
streets
of
london
in
safety
those
who
know
what
mischief
has
arisen
from
very
trifling
causes
will
of
course
perceive
the
necessity
of
checking
this
growing
evil
for
this
man
went
away
with
very
unfavourable
impressions
concerning
our
country
and
would
no
doubt
prejudice
many
against
us
and
make
them
suppose
we
are
worse
than
we
are
nearly
allied
to
this
is
pray
remember
poor
guy
faux
which
not
only
teaches
children
the
art
of
begging
but
is
frequently
the
means
of
their
becoming
dishonest
for
i
have
known
children
break
down
fences
and
and
in
short
any
thing
that
they
could
lay
their
hands
upon
in
order
to
make
a
bonfire
to
the
great
danger
of
the
inhabitants
near
it
without
producing
one
good
effect
yet
how
easily
might
this
practice
be
put
down
the
ill
effects
of
it
are
so
that
there
can
be
no
need
for
further
enlargement
i
also
disapprove
of
children
going
about
begging
at
christmas
this
practice
is
calculated
to
instil
into
the
children
minds
a
principle
of
meanness
not
becoming
the
english
character
and
the
money
they
get
seldom
if
ever
does
them
any
good
if
persons
choose
to
give
children
any
thing
at
this
time
of
the
year
there
can
be
no
objection
to
it
but
i
dislike
children
going
about
to
ask
for
money
like
common
beggars
it
can
not
be
proper
and
should
be
generally
discountenanced
all
these
things
to
some
men
may
appear
trifling
but
to
me
and
others
they
are
of
consequence
for
if
we
mean
to
improve
the
general
character
of
the
labouring
population
there
is
nothing
like
beginning
in
time
and
we
should
amongst
other
things
get
rid
of
all
mean
and
improper
customs
before
concluding
this
chapter
i
would
hint
to
travellers
not
to
give
children
money
for
running
after
a
coach
i
have
seen
children
of
both
sexes
run
until
their
breath
failed
and
completely
exhausted
drop
down
on
the
grass
merely
because
some
injudicious
persons
had
thrown
halfpence
to
them
i
have
also
seen
little
boys
turn
over
and
over
before
the
horses
for
the
purpose
of
getting
money
to
the
danger
of
their
own
lives
and
of
the
passengers
and
i
recollect
an
instance
of
one
boy
being
in
consequence
killed
on
the
spot
in
some
counties
children
will
in
spring
and
summer
run
after
a
carriage
with
flowers
upon
a
long
stick
thrusting
it
in
the
coach
or
the
faces
of
the
travellers
begging
halfpence
which
habit
had
been
taught
them
by
the
same
injudicious
means
the
most
virtuous
and
pious
of
men
on
looking
back
to
their
early
lives
have
almost
invariably
confessed
that
they
owe
the
first
seeds
of
what
is
excellent
in
them
to
the
blessing
of
god
on
the
instruction
and
example
of
their
parents
and
those
around
them
in
the
years
of
their
childhood
reflections
like
these
ought
to
make
us
humble
and
thankful
for
the
advantages
we
have
enjoyed
and
cause
us
to
look
with
an
eye
of
pity
charity
and
commiseration
on
the
vices
and
delinquencies
of
the
poor
rather
than
to
judge
them
with
harsh
and
cruel
severity
had
we
been
in
their
places
might
not
would
not
our
character
and
conduct
have
been
as
theirs
still
further
ought
not
such
thoughts
as
these
to
touch
our
hearts
with
deep
compassion
for
them
and
excite
us
to
strenuous
endeavours
to
remedy
these
lamentable
evils
by
the
most
powerful
and
effective
measures
that
can
be
found
and
more
especially
to
strive
if
possible
to
rescue
the
rising
generation
from
the

surrounding

misery

the

and
most
compendious
way
is
a
good
education
having
brought
the
prevalency
of
juvenile
delinquency
immediately
before
the
eyes
of
my
readers
by
various
examples
in
the
second
chapter
and
in
the
third
exhibited
a
few
of
the
causes
of
it
i
shall
now
proceed
to
point
out
what
in
my
humble
opinion
appears
to
be
the
only
efficient
remedy
namely
the
education
of
the
infant
poor
it
may
not
be
amiss
however
to
glance
at
the
means
which
have
heretofore
been
employed
and
found
though
productive
of
some
good
inefficient
for
the
end
proposed
as
preventives
i
may
notice
the
numerous
national
and
sunday
schools
tract
societies
established
throughout
the
kingdom
these
have
doubtless
much
good
effect
and
deserve
the
zealous
support
of
every
one
who
has
at
heart
the
welfare
of
society
in
general
and
the
improvement
of
the
labouring
classes
in
particular
many
have
been
plucked
as
brands
from
the
burning
by
these
institutions
which
are
a
blessing
to
the
objects
of
their
benevolence
and
an
honour
to
their
conductors
and
supporters
that
sunday
schools
are
not
wholly
efficient
in
conjunction
with
other
institutions
to
accomplish
the
end
desired
is
to
be
attributed
on
the
one
hand
to
the
small
portion
of
time
in
which
their
salutary
influence
is
exerted
and
on
the
other
to
their
not
admitting
children
at
a
sufficiently
early
age
at
the
period
usually
assigned
for
their
entrance
they
have
not
only
acquired
many
evil
habits
but
their
affections
have
become
so
thoroughly
perverted
as
to
offer
great
and
in
some
cases
insuperable
obstacles
to
the
corrective
efforts
of
their
teachers
each
child
brings
into
the
school
some
portion
of
acquired
evil
making
when
united
a
formidable
aggregate
and
affording
every
facility
for
mutual
contamination
add
to
this
the
counteracting
effect
which
the
bad
examples
they
meet
with
in
the
course
of
six
days
must
have
upon
the
good
they
hear
on
the
seventh
and
it
will
be
seen
how
little
comparatively
is
really
practicable
i
do
not
say
this
to
dishearten
those
who
are
engaged
in
this
labour
of
love
or
to
abate
the
zeal
of
its
promoters
at
the
same
time
that
their
experience
confirms
the
truth
of
my
observations
and
i
know
they
would
candidly
confess
that
it
does
so
they
must
have
many
gratifying
instances
of
a
contrary
nature
in
children
who
from
evil
habits
have
been
won
to
a
love
of
goodness
and
religion
shewn
not
merely
in
a
punctual
attendance
at
their
school
but
in
that
toward
their
and
grateful
love
to
their
teachers
which
are
the
only
infallible
signs
of
a
change
in
the
affections
these
things
encourage
them
in
spite
of
many
difficulties
and
mortifications
to
persevere
in
well
doing
and
may
the
god
of
love
bless
their
labours
with
an
increase
of
fruitfulness
it
is
only
my
purpose
here
to
state
that
the
most
likely
human
means
to
produce
such
an
increase
is
the
establishment
of
infant
schools
schools
designed
particularly
for
the
cultivation
of
the
affections
for
preparing
the
heart
to
receive
that
wisdom
which
teaches
us
to
love
god
supremely
and
to
love
our
neighbour
as
ourselves
as
to
the
system
of
instruction
pursued
in
sunday
schools
as
well
as
other
free
schools
it
is
indeed
my
opinion
that
some
alteration
for
the
better
might
be
made
but
as
i
intend
to
speak
of
this
matter
in
a
future
place
i
shall
say
no
more
on
the
subject
at
present
but
pass
on
to
notice
prison
discipline
which
is
i
fear
entitled
to
any
term
but
that
of
a
that
the
end
of
punishment
should
be
the
prevention
of
future
crime
rather
than
the
gratification
of
vindictive
feelings
whether
those
of
states
or
of
injured
individuals
but
few
will
venture
to
deny
and
yet
how
little
calculated
is
the
punishment
usually
inflicted
on
young
offenders
in
this
country
to
answer
that
end
they
are
shut
up
in
a
prison
in
company
with
other
thieves
perhaps
older
and
more
experienced
than
themselves
and
all
that
was
wanting
to
complete
their
education
in
dishonesty
is
here
attained
previously
to
their
confinement
within
the
walls
of
one
of
these
places
in
spite
of
the
assertions
of
their
hardened
associates
that
it
was
nothing
to
fear
it
is
probable
dread
or
apprehension
hung
over
their
minds
the
last
vestige
of
shame
had
not
been
banished
by
a
public
appearance
as
criminals
and
this
properly
taken
advantage
of
might
have
made
their
reformation
possible
but
having
encountered
the
object
of
their
fears
and
endured
the
shame
of
a
trial
shame
and
fear
are
alike
gone
for
ever
and
when
once
they
find
their
way
into
those
sinks
of
iniquity
there
is
very
little
hope
of
amendment
from
that
period
a
prison
has
not
the
least
terror
for
them
being
a
place
of
idleness
while
there
it
calls
forth
the
evil
inclinations
of
its
inmates
and
as
they
have
opportunities
of
indulging
those
inclinations
it
not
only
loses
all
its
utility
but
becomes
incalculably
injurious
i
heard
a
boy
who
had
been
confined
in
newgate
say
that
he
did
not
care
any
thing
about
it
that
his
companions
supplied
him
with
plenty
of
victuals
that
there
was
some
good
fun
to
be
seen
there
and
that
most
likely
he
should
soon
be
there
again
which
proved
too
true
for
he
was
shortly
after
taken
up
again
for
stealing
two
pieces
of
printed
calico
and
transported
this
with
a
multitude
of
similar
facts
will
shew
that
there
are
few
who
do
not
become
more
depraved
and
leave
such
places
worse
than
when
they
entered
them
a
gentleman
who
visited
newgate
informed
me
that
he
had
been
very
much
surprised
at
finding
so
many
children
there
some
of
whom
were
ironed
and
on
his
inquiring
the
cause
of
such
severity
towards
children
so
young
he
was
told
by
one
of
the
turnkeys
that
had
snuck
more
trouble
with
them
than
he
had
with
old
this
fact
has
been
verified
by
the
chief
officers
of
the
wakefield
model
prison
the
boys
give
most
trouble
in
the
matter
of
treating
juveniles
as
delinquents
i
am
sure
we
are
wrong
i
have
seen
both
the
magistrates
and
the
judges
insulted
on
the
bench
by
juveniles
brought
before
them
and
taunted
with
the
following
you
can
do
no
more
you
with
the
big
wig
i
wish
you
may
sit
there
until
i
come
out
and
in
the
month
of
may
the
magistrates
of
wakefield
were
insulted
by
a
boy
years
old
who
had
been
taken
up
as
an
impostor
with
his
arm
doubled
in
a
sling
and
shamming
to
be
deaf
and
dumb
a
healthy
strong
youth
able
and
fit
for
work
and
when
asked
why
he
did
not
work
answered
because
he
could
get
more
by
his
own
method
hear
this
ye
indiscriminate
and
further
when
expostulated
with
by
the
magistrates
for
the
sin
and
wickedness
of
pretending
to
be
lame
he
laughed
at
them
outright
for
being
so
silly
as
to
suppose
that
he
should
not
well
if
he
could
when
told
he
should
be
committed
for
three
months
he
had
the
impudence
to
tell
the
court
that
he
would
do
the
same
again
when
he
came
out
clapped
his
hat
on
in
open
defiance
and
shouted
that
all
you
can
do
the
chairman
expressed
sorrow
that
he
could
not
order
a
whipping
but
the
prisoner
laughed
at
him
and
said
i
am
too
old
for
that
such
things
were
not
known
in
my
younger
days
i
am
afraid
we
have
erred
in
this
matter
a
little
wholesome
correction
did
wonders
in
such
matters
it
at
least
made
the
parties
civil
and
i
think
deterred
from
crime
i
am
fearful
that
in
this
age
mankind
aim
in
some
things
to
be
more
perfect
than
the
great
ruler
of
the
universe
to
the
bad
habits
of
a
prison
and
the
association
with
guilt
must
be
added
the
deplorably
unprovided
state
in
which
at
the
termination
of
their
period
of
imprisonment
they
are
sent
forth
into
society
what
friends
have
they
but
their
former
companions
what
habitations
but
their
former
resorts
of
iniquity
what
means
of
procuring
a
livelihood
but
their
former
evil
practices
we
accordingly
find
that
it
is
not
unfrequently
the
case
with
these
young
offenders
that
scarcely
a
day
elapses
after
their
liberation
before
they
find
themselves
again
in
custody
and
within
the
walls
of
a
prison
one
can
not
indeed
view
the
exertions
made
by
the
society
for
the
improvement
of
prison
discipline
in
this
respect
without
feelings
of
gratitude
to
those
who
take
an
active
part
in
it
a
neither
should
we
forget
to
return
thanks
to
the
author
of
all
good
that
he
should
have
encouraged
the
hearts
of
persons
to
venture
even
their
lives
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
prisoners
in
newgate
and
elsewhere
that
even
females
are
found
who
conquering
the
timidity
and
diffidence
of
their
sex
have
visited
these
abodes
of
vice
and
misery
for
the
purpose
of
ameliorating
the
condition
of
their
inhabitants
there
have
been
men
claiming
to
be
considered
wise
men
who
have
ridiculed
the
exertions
of
these
daughters
of
philanthropy
and
have
made
them
objects
of
ridicule
but
happily
they
are
impervious
to
the
shafts
of
folly
and
as
heedless
of
the
unjust
censures
as
they
are
undesirous
of
the
applause
of
man
their
aim
is
the
good
of
their
their
reward
the
pleasure
of
doing
good
and
the
approbation
of
him
who
is
goodness
itself
that
their
and
praiseworthy
exertions
are
not
more
successful
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
the
awfully
depraved
affections
which
habitual
vice
produces
when
every
principle
of
action
which
should
be
subservient
to
virtue
becomes
actively
employed
in
the
cause
of
wickedness
for
whatever
may
be
the
impulse
which
first
induces
offenders
to
do
wrong
they
become
in
course
of
time
so
totally
lost
to
all
sense
of
what
is
good
as
to
glory
in
their
shame
whether
it
maybe
possible
to
devise
any
plan
of
prison
discipline
sufficient
to
remedy
the
evil
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
and
i
shall
only
repeat
the
burthen
of
my
song
and
protect
the
infant
and
it
will
be
found
that
is
not
only
better
but
easier
than
to
footnote
a
i
will
make
a
short
extract
from
one
of
its
reports
to
shew
that
the
chief
end
they
have
in
view
is
the
prevention
of
crime
they
state
that
in
the
course
of
their
visit
to
the
gaols
in
the
metropolis
the
committee
very
frequently
meet
with
destitute
boys
who
on
their
discharge
from
confinement
literally
know
not
where
to
lay
their
heads
to
assist
such
friendless
outcasts
has
been
the
practice
of
the
society
and
to
render
this
relief
more
efficacious
a
temporary
refuge
has
been
established
for
such
as
are
disposed
to
abandon
their
vicious
courses
this
asylum
has
been
instrumental
in
affording
assistance
to
a
considerable
number
of
distressed
youths
who
but
for
this
seasonable
aid
must
have
resorted
to
criminal
practices
for
support
on
admission
into
this
establishment
the
boys
are
instructed
in
moral
and
religious
duty
subjected
to
habits
of
order
and
industry
and
after
a
time
are
placed
in
situations
which
afford
a
reasonable
prospect
of
their
becoming
honest
and
useful
members
of
society
to
extend
these
objects
and
to
render
its
exertions
more
widely
beneficial
the
society
solicits
the
aid
of
public
benevolence
its
expenses
are
unavoidably
serious
and
its
funds
are
at
present
very
low
but
it
is
trusted
that
pecuniary
support
will
not
be
withheld
when
it
is
considered
that
on
the
liberality
with
which
this
appeal
is
answered
depends
in
a
great
measure
the
success
of
the
society
objects
the
reformation
of
the
vicious
and
the
prevention
of
crime
that
this
remedy
is
effectual
experience
has
taught
me
and
many
others
and
experience
is
a
guide
on
whom
we
may
safely
rely
it
has
shown
me
that
by
taking
children
at
an
early
age
out
of
the
reach
of
contamination
in
the
streets
and
removing
them
in
a
great
measure
from
the
no
less
baneful
influence
of
evil
example
at
home
we
may
lay
such
a
foundation
of
virtue
as
is
not
likely
to
be
shaken
nor
do
i
think
it
difficult
to
show
the
reason
of
this
it
is
confessed
on
all
hands
that
our
first
impressions
are
the
most
powerful
both
as
to
their
immediate
effects
and
future
influence
that
they
not
only
form
the
character
of
our
childhood
but
that
of
our
maturer
years
as
the
mind
of
a
child
expands
it
searches
for
new
objects
of
employment
or
gratification
and
this
is
the
time
when
the
young
fall
an
easy
prey
to
those
who
make
a
business
of
entrapping
them
into
the
paths
of
dishonesty
and
then
of
urging
them
to
crimes
of
deeper
dye
what
then
but
a
most
salutary
result
can
ensue
from
placing
a
child
in
a
situation
where
its
first
impressions
will
be
those
of
the
beauty
of
goodness
where
its
first
feelings
of
happiness
will
consist
in
the
receiving
and
cherishing
kind
ness
towards
its
little
neighbours
in
after
years
and
in
schools
for
older
children
it
is
reckoned
an
unavoidable
evil
that
they
should
be
congregated
together
in
numbers
not
so
in
the
infant
school
it
is
there
made
use
of
as
a
means
of
developing
and
exercising
those
kindly
feelings
which
must
conduce
to
the
individual
and
general
comfort
not
only
there
but
in
society
generally
it
is
not
merely
by
instructing
them
in
of
honesty
that
we
seek
to
provide
against
the
evil
but
by
the
surer
way
of
exciting
that
feeling
of
love
towards
each
other
towards
every
one
which
when
found
in
activity
must
not
only
prevent
dishonesty
but
every
other
species
of
selfishness
consider
the
difference
of
the
cases
in
the
one
case
we
behold
a
child
associated
in
happy
communion
with
a
society
a
little
world
of
its
own
age
and
feelings
continually
proving
the
possibility
of
giving
and
imparting
happiness
by
receiving
and
exercising
kindness
to
its
companions
secured
from
every
danger
supplied
with
a
constant
variety
of
amusement
which
is
at
the
same
time
instruction
and
all
this
under
the
care
of
a
master
or
mistress
acting
the
part
not
of
a
petulant
or
a
stern
pedagogue
but
of
a
kind
and
judicious
parent
in
the
case
of
the
child
not
thus
befriended
we
see
it
either
exposed
to
the
dangerous
associations
of
the
street
or
to
the
bad
examples
of
its
parents
to
their
unkindness
and
severity
or
misguided
indulgence
and
presented
moreover
with
every
facility
as
well
as
every
temptation
to
do
wrong
now
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
in
the
former
case
kind
obedient
honest
characters
should
be
the
result
and
in
the
latter
such
as
we
have
in
our
preceding
examples
exhibited
reason
tells
us
such
a
consequence
is
likely
and
experience
has
shewn
us
that
it
really
happens
i
could
enumerate
a
thousand
cases
of
honest
principle
in
the
infants
who
have
been
under
my
own
care
but
i
can
only
mention
one
or
two
circumstances
illustrative
of
the
matter
i
once
had
for
example
two
little
boys
to
travel
with
me
their
assistance
was
extremely
valuable
in
organizing
schools
they
were
often
invited
to
accompany
me
at
dinner
the
guests
generally
gave
them
presents
i
have
watched
them
under
many
tempting
circumstances
and
never
found
them
steal
it
is
my
firm
conviction
that
dishonesty
is
chiefly
the
effect
of
neglect
no
child
can
be
a
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
term
in
many
schools
too
there
are
planted
in
the
to
which
the
children
will
not
do
the
least
injury
nor
will
they
touch
the
fruit
flowers
in
pots
such
as
geraniums
auriculas
and
other
plants
are
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
without
the
least
danger
of
being
injured
such
is
their
respect
to
private
property
another
instance
particularly
excited
my
notice
amongst
the
children
in
the
first
establishments
in
london
they
were
permitted
to
bring
their
dinners
with
them
and
there
were
boxes
in
the
school
to
put
them
in
every
child
in
the
school
had
access
to
these
boxes
for
they
were
never
locked
and
yet
i
never
knew
a
child
to
lose
his
dinner
or
any
part
of
it
notwithstanding
many
of
the
children
to
my
knowledge
had
been
kept
extremely
short
of
food
i
have
known
an
instance
of
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
being
left
in
the
box
for
several
weeks
by
some
child
that
could
not
eat
it
but
none
of
the
other
children
would
dare
to
touch
it
i
have
found
in
the
boxes
two
or
three
pieces
of
bread
as
hard
as
possible
and
as
a
proof
that
many
were
hungry
and
that
it
did
not
remain
there
because
they
could
not
eat
it
but
out
of
pure
honesty
i
have
offered
it
to
some
of
the
children
and
they
have
eaten
it
in
that
state
cold
potatoes
pieces
of
fat
were
not
unacceptable
to
them
when
given
but
sooner
than
take
any
thing
without
leave
they
have
actually
left
it
to
spoil
these
are
facts
which
shew
that
notwithstanding
all
the
disadvantages
to
which
the
poor
children
are
exposed
their
character
may
be
so
far
formed
as
to
produce
the
effects
above
described
would
you
take
a
piece
of
bread
out
of
this
box
that
did
not
belong
to
you
said
i
to
the
children
one
day
no
sir
replied
a
little
girl
of
four
years
old
why
not
because
said
the
child
it
would
be
thieving
well
but
suppose
no
one
saw
you
before
i
could
speak
another
word
a
number
of
the
children
answered
god
can
see
everything
that
we
do
yes
added
another
little
boy
if
you
steal
a
cherry
or
a
piece
of
pencil
it
is
wicked
to
be
sure
added
another
it
is
wicked
to
steal
any
thing
i
can
not
do
better
than
introduce
in
this
place
the
opinion
of
judge
bosanquet
on
the
subject
of
the
education
of
the
infant
poor
and
some
valuable
hints
will
likewise
be
found
in
his
remarks
on
prison
discipline
it
is
an
extract
from
a
charge
to
the
jury
delivered
at
the
gloucester
assizes
for
april
gentlemen
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
offences
for
trial
on
this
occasion
are
rather
less
than
usual
at
this
season
and
to
whatever
the
diminution
of
crime
may
be
ascribed
i
can
not
forbear
earnestly
to
press
upon
your
attention
a
constant
perseverance
in
two
things
above
all
others
are
calculated
to
diminish
the
first
is
an
unremitted
attention
to
the
education
of
the
children
of
the
poor
and
of
all
classes
of
society
in
the
principles
of
true
morality
and
sound
religion
the
next
is
the
constant
and
regular
employment
of
such
persons
as
may
be
sentenced
to
imprisonment
in
such
labour
as
may
be
adapted
to
their
respective
ages
and
conditions
i
believe
that
these
observations
may
be
considered
as
quite
superfluous
in
this
county
and
therefore
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
using
the
word
perseverance
because
i
believe
your
attention
is
already
strongly
drawn
to
that
subject
and
it
requires
no
exhortation
of
mine
to
induce
your
attention
to
it
i
am
not
quite
sure
whether
in
the
gaol
for
this
city
the
same
means
are
provided
for
the
employment
of
those
persons
sentenced
to
terms
of
imprisonment
which
are
provided
in
the
gaol
for
the
county
the
magistrates
for
the
city
are
equally
desirous
of
promoting
the
education
of
all
the
poor
under
their
care
i
have
no
doubt
and
i
do
hope
and
trust
if
the
means
of
labour
have
not
been
provided
in
their
gaol
that
no
time
will
be
lost
in
providing
those
means
by
which
imprisonment
may
be
made
a
real
punishment
by
which
offenders
may
be
reformed
during
their
imprisonment
and
by
which
the
idle
and
dissolute
may
be
prevented
from
any
inclination
to
return
there
a
footnote
a
from
the
time
the
judge
referred
to
made
the
above
remarks
other
judges
down
to
the
present
time
have
added
similar
sentiments
from
until
proof
upon
proof
has
been
added
to
show
us
the
advantage
of
early
training
and
though
much
has
been
cramming
and
not
training
still
the
results
have
been
good
what
would
they
have
been
had
the
schooling
given
really
been
and
what
if
the
training
of
children
had
been
studied
as
if
the
public
looked
on
the
teachers
as
artists
and
treated
them
with
the
consideration
they
deserve
anticipations
can
not
be
too
sanguine
in
estimating
the
results
that
must
accrue
to
society
from
a
system
of
spiritual
intellectual
and
moral
culture
becoming
universal
and
worked
out
by
minds
who
will
i
am
sure
hereafter
be
able
fully
to
develope
from
study
and
practice
of
the
of
teaching
the
great
principles
of
spiritual
truths
intellectual
vigour
and
the
moral
strength
of
the
coming
generations
which
have
been
allowed
to
remain
in
a
state
of
torpor
in
the
present
i
have
hitherto
only
being
considering
the
motives
which
should
induce
us
to
promote
the
education
of
the
poor
i
have
shown
that
it
will
be
for
the
benefit
of
society
inasmuch
as
it
is
likely
to
decrease
the
number
of
those
who
transgress
its
laws
that
it
will
prove
a
greater
security
to
our
persons
and
property
than
laws
or
prisons
afford
but
there
are
other
motives
which
if
these
selfish
ones
were
wholly
wanting
might
be
sufficient
to
advocate
in
every
humane
heart
the
same
course
of
conduct
if
the
duty
of
promoting
honesty
amongst
the
labouring
classes
did
not
exist
that
of
increasing
happiness
and
piety
amongst
them
would
not
be
the
less
imperative
that
there
is
much
room
for
an
augmentation
of
both
few
i
think
will
be
inclined
to
deny
the
less
so
in
proportion
as
they
have
had
the
greater
opportunity
of
ascertaining
their
actual
condition
let
us
now
for
a
few
moments
consider
how
great
a
blessing
an
infant
school
is
even
when
regarded
as
a
mere
asylum
to
take
charge
of
the
child
bodily
welfare
i
have
mentioned
before
that
the
poor
are
unable
to
take
that
care
of
their
children
which
their
tender
age
requires
on
account
of
their
occupations
and
have
shewn
that
it
is
almost
certain
that
the
children
of
such
persons
will
learn
every
species
of
vice
but
there
are
other
kinds
of
dangers
which
more
immediately
affect
the
body
and
are
the
cause
of
more
accidents
than
people
in
general
imagine
i
shall
here
notice
some
of
the
most
prominent
and
hope
to
be
able
to
convince
the
unprejudiced
mind
that
it
would
be
a
charity
to
take
charge
of
the
infant
poor
even
leaving
the
idea
of
their
learning
any
thing
good
at
school
entirely
out
of
the
question
and
surely
those
persons
who
disapprove
of
educating
the
poor
at
all
will
see
the
propriety
of
keeping
if
possible
their
children
safe
from
accidents
and
preserving
the
lives
of
many
little
ones
who
would
otherwise
be
lost
to
their
country
from
their
falling
a
prey
to
surrounding
dangers
it
is
well
known
that
many
poor
people
are
obliged
to
live
in
garrets
three
or
four
stories
high
with
a
family
of
six
or
seven
children
and
it
will
not
appear
improbable
that
when
the
children
are
left
by
themselves
they
should
frequently
meet
with
accidents
by
tumbling
down
stairs
some
breaking
their
backs
others
their
legs
or
arms
and
to
this
cause
alone
perhaps
may
be
traced
a
vast
number
of
the
cripples
that
daily
appear
as
mendicants
in
our
streets
when
the
poor
parents
return
from
their
daily
labour
they
sometimes
have
the
mortification
of
finding
that
one
or
probably
two
of
their
children
are
gone
to
an
hospital
which
of
course
makes
them
unhappy
and
unfits
them
for
going
through
their
daily
labour
this
dead
weight
which
is
continually
on
the
minds
of
parents
is
frequently
the
cause
of
their
being
unable
to
please
their
employers
and
the
consequence
sometimes
is
they
are
thrown
out
of
work
altogether
whereas
if
they
were
certain
that
their
children
were
taken
care
of
they
would
proceed
with
their
daily
labour
cheerfully
and
be
enabled
to
give
more
satisfaction
to
their
employers
than
they
otherwise
can
do
other
parents
i
have
known
who
when
obliged
to
go
out
have
locked
their
children
in
a
room
to
prevent
them
from
getting
into
the
street
or
falling
down
stairs
and
who
have
taken
every
precaution
as
they
imagined
to
protect
their
children
but
the
little
creatures
perhaps
after
fretting
and
crying
for
hours
at
being
thus
confined
have
ventured
to
get
up
to
the
window
in
order
to
see
what
was
passing
in
the
street
when
one
itself
has
fallen
out
and
been
killed
on
the
spot
a
gentleman
said
at
a
public
meeting
at
exeter
when
referring
to
this
subject
i
have
myself
twice
in
my
life
nearly
occasioned
the
death
of
children
in
one
instance
a
child
left
to
itself
ran
out
of
the
hedge
by
the
i
was
fortunately
able
to
stop
and
found
the
child
unconscious
of
its
escape
raising
its
hands
to
the
reins
of
the
horse
and
on
another
occasion
my
horse
threw
a
child
down
and
i
had
but
just
time
to
pull
up
and
prevent
the
wheels
from
passing
over
the
infant
head
and
it
was
stated
in
a
bristol
paper
that
in
the
short
space
of
fortnight
children
were
taken
to
the
infirmary
of
that
city
so
dreadfully
burnt
that
four
of
them
died
numerous
cases
of
this
kind
are
to
be
found
in
the
public
prints
and
hundreds
of
such
accidents
occur
which
are
not
noticed
in
the
papers
at
all
many
children
again
strolling
into
the
fields
fall
into
ponds
and
ditches
and
are
drowned
so
numerous
indeed
are
the
dangers
which
surround
the
infant
poor
as
to
make
a
forcible
appeal
to
the
hearts
of
the
pious
and
humane
and
to
call
loudly
on
them
to
unite
in
rescuing
this
hitherto
neglected
part
of
the
rising
generation
from
the
evils
to
which
they
are
exposed
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
those
persons
who
most
need
employment
should
be
the
last
to
procure
it
but
such
is
the
fact
for
there
are
so
many
obstacles
thrown
in
the
way
of
married
persons
and
especially
those
with
a
family
that
many
are
tempted
to
deny
that
they
have
any
children
for
fear
they
should
lose
their
situations
though
it
is
certainly
an
additional
stimulus
to
a
servant
to
behave
orderly
when
he
knows
that
he
has
others
to
look
to
him
for
support
shall
i
close
this
appeal
for
the
necessity
of
educating
the
infant
poor
by
another
and
weightier
argument
they
are
and
beings
it
may
be
thought
that
i
should
have
given
this
plea
the
precedence
of
every
other
i
did
not
because
i
felt
more
anxious
to
make
good
my
ground
with
the
prudent
and
the
philanthropic
to
show
them
that
and
humanity
demand
our
exertions
in
this
cause
i
knew
that
when
i
came
to
urge
such
efforts
upon
the
attention
of
the
christian
i
could
not
possibly
fail
no
one
who
is
a
sincere
follower
of
him
who
said
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
and
forbid
them
not
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
no
one
who
professes
to
abide
by
the
maxims
of
him
whose
commandment
was
love
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
can
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
entreaties
of
those
who
are
necessitous
and
suffering
thousands
there
are
among
those
of
whom
we
have
been
speaking
who
are
brought
up
in
as
great
ignorance
of
god
and
religion
as
though
they
had
been
born
in
a
country
where
the
light
of
revelation
had
never
shone
where
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
have
never
been
proclaimed
with
examples
of
evil
continually
before
their
eyes
both
at
home
and
abroad
we
see
and
hear
its
consequences
daily
in
the
wickedness
with
which
our
streets
abound
and
in
the
lisped
blasphemy
and
profanity
of
those
who
learn
to
curse
and
swear
before
they
can
well
walk
whilst
i
was
at
lincoln
i
was
shocked
beyond
measure
by
the
horrid
language
of
the
boys
to
such
a
pitch
had
the
evil
come
that
the
magistrates
were
determined
to
fine
all
the
men
who
were
brought
before
them
for
profane
swearing
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
that
four
men
had
been
fined
whilst
i
was
there
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
if
other
magistrates
throughout
the
kingdom
would
follow
their
example
any
person
who
has
been
accustomed
to
walk
the
streets
of
london
must
have
heard
how
frequently
children
take
the
name
of
the
almighty
in
vain
seldom
or
ever
mentioning
it
but
to
confirm
some
oath
i
have
seen
boys
playing
at
marbles
tops
and
other
games
and
who
on
a
dispute
arising
about
some
frivolous
thing
would
call
upon
the
supreme
being
to
strike
them
deaf
dumb
or
blind
nay
even
dead
if
what
they
said
were
not
true
when
nevertheless
i
have
been
satisfied
from
having
observed
the
origin
of
the
dispute
that
the
party
using
the
expressions
has
been
telling
a
falsehood
indeed
so
common
is
this
kind
of
language
in
the
streets
that
it
often
passes
without
notice
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
children
accustomed
to
use
such
expressions
on
every
trifling
occasion
will
when
they
grow
to
riper
years
pay
very
little
respect
to
the
sanctity
of
an
oath
it
is
perhaps
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
hear
of
so
much
perjury
in
the
present
day
at
all
events
little
children
can
not
avoid
hearing
such
expressions
not
only
from
those
who
are
rather
older
than
themselves
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
even
from
their
parents
i
have
known
repeated
instances
of
this
kind
many
little
ones
when
they
first
come
to
our
schools
make
use
of
dreadful
expressions
and
when
told
that
it
is
wrong
will
say
that
they
did
not
know
it
was
so
others
with
the
greatest
simplicity
have
declared
that
they
had
heard
their
fathers
or
mothers
say
the
same
words
hence
i
have
had
much
difficulty
in
persuading
them
that
it
was
wrong
for
they
very
naturally
thought
that
if
their
parents
made
use
of
such
language
they
might
do
the
same
how
great
is
the
necessity
of
good
example
and
did
parents
generally
consider
how
apt
children
are
to
receive
impressions
and
to
become
imitators
both
in
their
words
and
actions
they
would
be
more
cautious
than
they
are
there
are
many
parents
who
make
use
of
very
bad
expressions
themselves
who
would
correct
their
children
for
using
the
same
as
a
proof
of
this
i
will
mention
one
circumstance
out
of
many
others
that
took
place
in
the
school
i
superintended
many
years
since
we
had
a
little
girl
there
five
years
old
who
was
so
fond
of
the
school
that
she
frequently
stopped
after
the
usual
hours
to
play
with
my
children
and
some
others
who
chose
to
stay
in
the
many
of
them
would
stop
till
eight
or
nine
at
night
to
which
i
had
no
objection
provided
their
parents
approved
of
it
and
they
did
not
get
into
mischief
it
being
desirable
to
keep
them
out
of
the
streets
as
much
as
possible
it
happened
however
one
day
that
some
of
the
children
offended
this
child
and
she
called
them
by
dreadful
names
such
as
i
can
not
repeat
and
of
course
the
others
were
terrified
and
told
me
of
them
immediately
i
was
soon
satisfied
that
the
child
was
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
what
she
said
for
as
an
excuse
for
her
conduct
she
declared
that
she
heard
her
father
and
mother
use
the
same
words
i
told
the
child
that
notwithstanding
her
parents
might
have
done
so
it
was
very
wicked
and
that
i
could
not
let
her
stay
another
time
to
play
if
ever
she
did
so
again
having
sent
for
the
mother
i
informed
her
of
the
expressions
the
child
had
used
but
did
not
tell
her
what
she
had
mentioned
relative
to
her
parents
for
if
i
had
she
would
have
beaten
her
most
unmercifully
the
mother
after
having
heard
me
relate
the
circumstance
immediately
flew
into
a
passion
with
the
child
and
declared
that
she
would
skin
her
alive
this
was
her
expression
and
i
had
much
difficulty
to
restrain
her
from
correcting
the
child
in
the
school
having
pacified
her
a
little
i
inquired
where
the
child
could
have
heard
such
wicked
expressions
she
said
she
could
not
tell
i
then
told
her
i
hoped
the
child
did
not
learn
them
of
her
or
her
father
to
this
she
made
no
answer
but
i
could
perceive
that
she
stood
and
having
said
what
i
conceived
necessary
upon
the
occasion
i
dismissed
her
observing
that
it
was
useless
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
establish
schools
for
the
education
of
the
infant
poor
if
the
parents
did
not
assist
by
setting
them
a
good
example
i
am
happy
to
state
that
the
advice
i
gave
her
was
not
thrown
away
as
i
never
knew
the
child
guilty
of
saying
a
bad
word
afterwards
and
the
mother
soon
brought
me
another
child
of
two
years
and
a
half
old
and
said
she
should
be
very
glad
if
i
would
take
it
into
the
school
and
that
she
wished
a
blessing
might
always
attend
the
gentlemen
who
supported
the
institution
she
also
requested
me
to
take
an
opportunity
of
speaking
a
few
words
to
her
husband
for
she
was
thankful
for
what
had
been
said
to
her
and
here
i
would
observe
that
although
it
is
most
undoubtedly
true
that
the
good
taught
to
children
in
our
infant
schools
is
greatly
counteracted
by
the
conduct
they
witness
on
their
return
home
yet
we
occasionally
see
that
these
little
children
by
the
blessing
of
god
are
made
the
means
of
reforming
their
own
parents
what
a
gratifying
fact
it
is
that
the
adult
and
hardened
sinner
may
be
turned
from
his
evil
ways
from
death
unto
life
by
an
infant
precept
or
example
nor
is
it
only
in
profane
expressions
that
we
see
the
influence
of
evil
some
children
i
have
known
in
the
same
neighbourhood
who
even
beat
their
parents
there
was
a
poor
widow
very
near
the
school
who
was
frequently
to
be
seen
with
her
face
dreadfully
bruised
by
blows
from
her
own
son
he
had
been
taken
before
a
magistrate
and
imprisoned
for
three
months
but
it
did
him
no
good
for
he
afterwards
beat
his
mother
as
much
as
ever
and
the
poor
woman
had
it
in
contemplation
to
get
the
miscreant
sent
out
of
the
country
one
sunday
i
remember
to
have
seen
a
boy
under
twelve
years
of
age
take
up
a
large
stone
to
throw
at
his
mother
he
had
done
something
wrong
in
the
house
and
the
mother
followed
him
into
the
street
with
a
small
cane
to
correct
him
for
it
but
he
told
his
mother
that
if
she
dared
to
approach
him
he
would
knock
her
down
the
mother
retired
and
the
boy
went
where
he
pleased
these
and
many
similar
scenes
i
have
witnessed
and
i
am
afraid
that
many
such
characters
have
been
so
completely
formed
as
to
be
past
reformation
so
essential
is
it
to
embrace
the
first
opportunity
of
impressing
on
the
infant
mind
the
principles
of
duty
and
virtue
i
am
aware
that
many
excellent
institutions
are
in
existence
for
the
spread
of
the
gospel
amongst
the
ignorant
and
depraved
at
home
as
well
as
abroad
but
i
must
here
again
advert
to
the
readier
reception
of
religious
truths
in
infancy
than
by
the
adult
and
confirmed
sinner
i
would
not
say
to
those
who
are
engaged
in
the
painful
task
painful
because
so
often
unsuccessful
forego
your
labours
but
i
would
call
upon
all
who
have
at
heart
the
everlasting
welfare
of
the
souls
of
men
to
exert
themselves
that
the
rising
generation
may
not
likewise
grow
up
into
that
state
of
perverseness
that
they
may
not
in
future
years
prove
themselves
to
be
a
generation
which
like
the
adder
turneth
a
deaf
ear
to
the
charmer
charm
he
ever
so
wisely
i
am
satisfied
from
the
experience
i
have
had
that
an
amount
of
good
is
attainable
from
early
and
judicious
culture
which
far
very
far
surpasses
all
that
has
heretofore
been
accomplished
and
on
which
not
a
few
are
even
unprepared
to
calculate
it
was
a
wish
expressed
by
king
george
that
every
child
in
his
dominions
should
be
able
to
read
the
bible
and
from
the
increased
facility
of
doing
so
from
gratuitous
education
the
number
of
those
who
can
not
is
much
less
than
formerly
but
in
many
cases
the
necessitous
circumstances
of
the
parents
prevent
them
from
allowing
their
children
except
during
their
infant
years
the
advantage
of
instruction
even
though
it
cost
them
nothing
the
time
for
the
children
of
the
poor
to
receive
instruction
is
between
the
ages
of
two
and
eight
after
that
period
many
are
sent
out
to
work
or
detained
at
home
for
they
then
become
useful
to
their
parents
and
can
not
be
sent
to
school
there
are
many
little
girls
who
having
left
the
infant
school
go
out
to
work
for
a
shilling
a
week
and
the
mothers
have
declared
to
me
when
i
have
endeavoured
to
persuade
them
to
send
them
to
the
national
school
for
at
least
one
year
that
they
could
not
do
it
for
they
were
so
poor
that
every
shilling
was
a
great
help
they
have
however
promised
me
that
they
would
send
them
to
the
sunday
school
this
may
account
in
some
measure
for
there
being
so
many
more
boys
than
girls
in
almost
every
school
in
london
and
chews
that
great
good
has
been
done
and
is
doing
by
those
valuable
institutions
a
footnote
a
it
is
to
be
observed
here
that
the
children
do
not
come
to
or
schools
on
sundays
but
many
of
them
between
five
and
six
years
old
who
have
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
national
school
go
with
them
to
church
and
others
of
the
same
age
go
to
a
sunday
school
in
the
neighbourhood
in
short
i
may
venture
to
say
that
almost
all
the
children
that
are
able
go
either
to
a
sunday
school
or
to
church
but
to
take
them
all
in
a
body
at
the
early
age
that
they
are
admitted
into
an
infant
school
to
any
place
of
worship
and
to
keep
them
there
for
two
or
three
hours
with
a
hope
to
profit
them
and
not
to
disturb
the
congregation
is
according
to
my
view
injurious
if
not
impracticable
many
of
my
readers
who
have
been
in
the
habit
of
noticing
and
pitying
the
poor
may
think
the
detail
into
which
i
have
entered
superfluous
but
i
can
assure
them
the
want
of
information
on
the
subject
is
but
too
general
and
is
sufficient
to
account
for
the
indifference
which
has
so
long
been
exhibited
the
objection
that
education
is
altogether
improper
for
poor
people
is
not
quite
obsolete
there
are
not
wanting
persons
who
still
entertain
the
most
dreadful
apprehensions
of
the
march
of
intellect
as
it
has
been
termed
who
see
no
alternative
but
that
it
must
every
thing
that
is
established
and
subvert
the
whole
order
of
society
i
would
willingly
impart
comfort
to
the
minds
of
those
who
are
afflicted
with
such
nervous
tremours
but
i
fear
if
the
demonstration
of
experience
has
not
quieted
them
the
voice
of
reason
never
will
it
can
not
fail
to
remind
us
of
the
apprehensions
of
the
popish
clergy
in
former
times
who
decried
the
art
of
printing
then
recently
introduced
as
a
branch
of
the
black
art
which
if
encouraged
must
eventually
demolish
the
social
fabric
and
introduce
civil
wars
and
discord
into
every
country
time
that
test
of
truth
has
shewn
us
how
groundless
their
apprehensions
were
instead
of
injuring
that
fabric
it
has
strengthened
its
foundation
so
that
it
can
not
be
shaken
and
has
surrounded
it
with
defences
which
bid
defiance
to
assaults
oh
that
the
time
were
come
when
every
heart
being
imbued
with
truly
christian
principles
would
see
that
the
noblest
and
highest
object
that
could
be
set
before
us
would
be
to
rear
up
the
minds
of
the
young
in
knowledge
virtue
and
piety
to
train
them
to
intelligence
and
usefulness
in
this
life
and
for
happiness
and
immortality
in
the
life
to
come
on
such
labours
the
blessing
of
god
would
inevitably
rest
and
his
promise
of
their
success
is
positive
and
unconditional
train
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
and
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
depart
from
it
to
the
furtherance
of
the
infant
system
i
have
devoted
for
many
years
my
utmost
energies
and
resources
and
to
it
i
purpose
to
give
them
so
long
as
i
am
permitted
by
the
gracious
providence
of
god
i
shall
be
happy
to

is
not
as
i
think
to
perfect
a
learner
in
all
or
any
one
of
the
sciences
but
to
give
his
mind
that
disposition
and
those
habits
that
may
enable
him
to
attain
any
part
of
knowledge
he
shall
stand
in
need
of
in
the
future
coarse
of
his
when
the
obligations
of
morality
are
taught
let
the
sanctions
of
christianity
never
be
forgotten
by
which
it
will
be
shewn
not
that
they
give
lustre
and
strength
to
each
other
religion
will
appear
to
be
the
voice
of
reason
and
morality
the
will
of
when
agesilaus
king
of
sparta
was
asked
what
should
boys
be
taught
he
answered
what
they
ought
to
do
when
they
become
men
such
a
declaration
was
worthy
of
later
times
since
the
most
intelligent
now
admit
that
the
great
end
of
all
education
is
the
formation
of
solid
useful
and
virtuous
character
this
work
should
be
doubtless
commenced
at
the
earliest
possible
period
to
it
the
system
explained
in
this
volume
is
considered
to
be
adapted
and
the
principles
on
which
it
proceeds
are
now
to
be
illustrated
and
here
it
ought
to
be
particularly
observed
that
nothing
is
admissible
except
what
is
appropriate
to
the
state
of
infancy
calculated
to
exercise
the
physical
energies
and
likely
by
their
invigoration
to
lay
the
basis
of
a
sound
and
powerful
intellect
and
yet
all
this
is
too
often
forgotten
look
at
the
infant
the
very
embodying
of
vivacity
and
activity
and
its
confinement
to
a
particular
posture
or
the
requirement
of
a
peculiar
expression
of
countenance
is
manifestly
unnatural
an
inactive
and
healthy
child
under
six
years
of
age
is
never
seen
whatever
compels
it
to
be
otherwise
consequently
produces
what
is
artificial
in
character
a
parent
or
a
teacher
may
keep
his
children
quiet
and
in
what
he
terms
order
but
it
does
not
follow
that
this
is
a
good
preparation
for
after
years
on
the
contrary
bondage
may
issue
in
excess
the
feelings
and
propensities
which
instead
of
being
corrected
are
unduly
restrained
will
be
manifested
in
some
other
ways
and
under
less
favourable
circumstances
and
frequently
the
reaction
will
be
violent
in
maturity
hence
the
system
now
recommended
is
expressly
one
for
adapted
to
them
just
as
they
are
and
wholly
designed
to
repress
what
is
evil
and
to
cherish
what
is
good
accordingly
the
utmost
attention
is
given
to
the
cheerfulness
and
happiness
of
those
on
whom
it
acts
instruction
in
reading
arithmetic
geometry
and
various
other
things
is
made
exceedingly
amusing
smiling
countenances
and
sparkling
eyes
are
observable
all
around
when
it
is
communicated
and
what
was
dull
and
soporific
according
to
the
old
plan
is
now
insinuated
so
agreeably
that
the
child
while
literally
at
play
is
acquiring
a
large
amount
of
valuable
knowledge
at
play
he
sees
nature
book
that
world
of
beauties
he
loves
to
look
into
it
there
is
no
flogging
to
induce
him
to
do
it
all
is
enquiry
and
anxiety
on
his
part
what
is
this
what
is
that
what
is
it
for
how
did
it
come
with
numerous
other
questions
of
similar
import
oh
that
we
had
teachers
to
teach
more
out
of
this
divine
book
oh
that
we
had
a
public
who
would
encourage
and
cherish
them
for
so
doing
what
blessed
results
even
have
i
seen
by
one
being
able
to
answer
such
enquiries
the
absurd
notion
that
children
can
only
be
taught
in
a
room
must
be
exploded
i
have
done
more
in
one
hour
in
the
garden
in
the
lanes
and
in
the
fields
to
cherish
and
satisfy
the
budding
faculties
of
childhood
than
could
have
been
done
in
a
room
for
months
oh
mankind
have
yet
something
to
learn
about
teaching
children
see
how
they
catch
at
truths
through
the
medium
of
living
things
see
how
it
germinates
in
them
by
so
doing
the
teacher
may
forget
they
do
not
this
i
have
proved
hundreds
of
times
music
has
proved
a
most
important
auxiliary
for
this
purpose
and
a
stranger
would
be
astonished
at
the
hilarity
and
delight
with
which
much
is
rehearsed
with
a
full
perception
of
its
meaning
when
in
any
other
way
it
would
be
irksome
and
unintelligible
these
attainments
moreover
are
accompanied
by
various
movements
and
evolutions
which
exercise
the
limbs
the
joints
the
muscles
in
addition
to
which
set
times
are
appointed
every
morning
and
afternoon
for
its
exclusive
enjoyment
the
conduct
of
inferior
animals
when
young
shows
the
propriety
of
giving
exercise
to
children
every
other
creature
makes
use
of
its
organs
of
motion
as
soon
as
possible
and
many
of
them
when
under
no
necessity
of
moving
in
quest
of
food
can
not
be
restrained
without
force
such
is
the
case
with
the
calf
the
lamb
and
many
more
if
these
creatures
were
not
permitted
to
frisk
about
at
pleasure
they
would
soon
die
or
become
diseased
the
same
inclination
appears
very
early
in
the
human
species
but
as
they
are
not
able
to
take
exercise
themselves
it
is
the
business
of
their
parents
and
nurses
to
give
it
them
this
may
be
done
in
various
ways
and
the
methods
included
in
the
system
are
shewn
in
other
parts
of
this
work
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
men
should
be
so
inattentive
to
this
matter
their
negligence
is
one
reason
why
females
know
so
little
of
it
women
will
always
be
desirous
to
excel
in
such
accomplishments
as
recommend
them
to
the
other
sex
but
men
generally
avoid
even
the
slightest
acquaintance
with
the
affairs
of
the
nursery
and
many
would
reckon
it
an
affront
were
they
supposed
to
know
any
thing
of
them
not
so
however
with
the
kennel
or
the
stables
a
gentleman
of
the
first
rank
who
is
not
ashamed
to
give
directions
concerning
the
management
of
his
dogs
or
horses
would
blush
were
he
surprised
in
performing
the
same
office
for
that
being
who
is
to
be
the
heir
of
his
fortunes
and
perhaps
the
future
hope
of
his
country
arguments
to
show
the
importance
of
exercise
might
be
drawn
from
every
part
of
the
animal
economy
without
it
the
circulation
of
the
blood
can
not
be
properly
carried
on
nor
the
different
secretions
duly
performed
neither
can
the
fluids
be
properly
prepared
nor
the
solids
rendered
firm
or
strong
the
action
of
the
heart
the
motion
of
the
lungs
and
all
the
vital
functions
are
greatly
assisted
by
exercise
but
to
point
out
the
manner
in
which
these
effects
are
produced
would
lead
us
beyond
the
present
subject
we
shall
therefore
only
add
that
when
exercise
is
neglected
none
of
the
animal
functions
can
be
duly
performed
and
when
this
is
the
case
the
whole
constitution
must
go
to
wreck
healthy
parents
wholesome
food
and
suitable
clothing
will
avail
little
where
it
is
disregarded
sufficient
exercise
will
supply
many
defects
in
nursing
but
nothing
can
compensate
for
its
want
a
good
constitution
ought
certainly
to
be
our
first
object
in
the
management
of
children
it
lays
a
foundation
for
their
being
useful
and
happy
in
life
and
whoever
neglects
it
not
only
fails
in
his
duty
to
his
offspring
but
to
society
while
this
is
forgotten
let
us
not
complain
of
weak
and
thoughtless
children
or
of
weak
and
thoughtless
servants
for
the
former
are
so
from
the
neglect
of
their
parents
and
the
public
and
the
latter
from
not
having
been
taught
to
think
at
all
and
yet
the
very
persons
that
object
to
the
education
of
the
poor
are
the
first
to
complain
of
their
servants
a
notion
that
habits
of
industry
must
be
established
has
however
been
the
means
i
regret
to
state
of
a
sad
perversion
of
the
system
in
these
respects
the
time
allowed
for
amusement
and
exercise
has
been
in
some
cases
very
much
abridged
that
the
children
might
learn
and
practise
sewing
knitting
plaiting
now
no
one
can
be
more
disposed
to
the
encouragement
of
industrious
habits
than
myself
but
i
would
say
not
at
the
expense
of
health
which
i
am
certain
in
these
cases
it
must
be
deprive
the
children
of
their
amusement
and
they
will
soon
cease
to
be
the
lively
happy
beings
we
have
hitherto
seen
them
and
will
become
the
sickly
inanimate
creatures
we
have
been
accustomed
to
behold
and
pity
under
the
confinement
and
restraint
of
the
dame
schools
i
do
not
scruple
to
affirm
that
if
the
of
infant
schools
are
cut
off
from
the
system
they
will
from
that
moment
cease
to
be
a
blessing
to
the
country
nothing
has
given
me
greater
pain
than
to
witness
the
thorough
neglect
of
attendance
on
the
part
of
teachers
and
the
public
the
former
leave
the
children
to
themselves
at
the
very
time
their
attendance
is
most
desirable
and
when
if
duly
watched
the
children
will
give
them
yes
such
lessons
as
no
book
can
give
and
such
lessons
as
every
efficient
teacher
learn
or
efficiency
is
out
of
the
question
the
public
are
too
fond
of
hearing
tasks
and
memory
work
and
such
as
is
taught
in
school
with
the
singing
and
the
amusing
indoor
work
to
the
detriment
and
neglect
of
the
moral
and
physical
outdoor
work
again
and
again
i
say
the
outdoor
training
tells
most
upon
the
morals
and
the
formation
of
character
the
first
faculties
which
develop
themselves
in
childhood
are
those
of
observation
the
infant
who
is
two
months
old
will
notice
a
lighted
candle
immediately
that
sense
is
gratified
it
seeks
to
please
another
that
of
and
every
mother
knows
if
not
prevented
it
will
put
its
hand
in
the
flame
the
next
effort
is
to
examine
other
objects
these
it
will
seize
if
it
can
and
after
having
examined
one
it
will
put
it
aside
to
observe
another
on
its
being
able
to
move
about
it
seeks
objects
within
its
reach
and
wishing
to
gratify
the
sense
of
taste
applies
every
thing
to
the
mouth
by
this
it
distinguishes
the
bitter
from
the
sweet
and
on
seeing
what
is
sweet
a
second
time
will
point
to
it
and
wish
to
obtain
it
whilst
what
is
bitter
will
not
be
desired
the
part
of
the
system
should
now
be
adverted
to
hence
it
has
been
well
remarked
from
the
time
that
children
begin
to
use
their
hands
nature
directs
them
to
handle
every
thing
over
and
over
to
look
at
it
while
they
handle
it
and
to
put
it
into
various
positions
and
at
various
distances
from
the
eye
we
are
apt
to
excuse
this
as
a
childish
diversion
because
they
must
be
doing
something
and
have
not
reason
to
entertain
themselves
in
a
more
manly
way
but
if
we
think
more
justly
we
shall
find
that
they
are
engaged
in
the
most
serious
and
important
study
and
if
they
had
all
the
reason
of
a
philosopher
they
could
not
be
more
properly
employed
for
it
is
this
childish
employment
that
enables
them
to
make
the
proper
use
of
their
eyes
they
are
thereby
every
day
acquiring
habits
of
perception
which
are
of
greater
importance
than
any
thing
we
can
teach
them
the
original
perceptions
which
nature
gave
them
are
few
and
insufficient
for
the
purposes
of
life
and
therefore
she
made
them
capable
of
many
more
perceptions
by
habit
and
to
complete
her
work
she
has
given
them
an
unwearied
assiduity
in
applying
to
the
exercise
by
which
those
perceptions
are
acquired
such
is
the
education
which
nature
gives
her
children
and
we
may
add
that
another
part
of
her
discipline
is
that
by
the
course
of
things
children
must
exert
all
their
muscular
force
and
employ
all
their
ingenuity
in
order
to
gratify
their
curiosity
and
satisfy
their
little
appetites
what
they
desire
is
only
to
be
obtained
at
the
cost
of
labour
patience
and
many
disappointments
by
the
exercise
of
the
body
and
mind
necessary
for
satisfying
their
desires
they
acquire
agility
strength
and
dexterity
in
their
motions
as
well
as
constitutional
health
and
vigour
they
learn
to
bear
pain
without
dejection
and
disappointment
without
despondency
the
education
of
nature
is
most
perfect
in
savages
who
have
no
other
tutor
and
we
see
that
in
the
quickness
of
all
their
senses
in
the
agility
of
their
motions
in
the
hardiness
of
their
constitutions
and
in
their
ability
to
bear
hunger
thirst
pain
and
disappointment
they
commonly
far
exceed
civilized
nations
on
this
account
a
most
ingenious
writer
seems
to
prefer
savage
to
social
life
but
it
is
the
intention
of
nature
that
human
education
should
assist
to
form
the
man
and
she
has
fitted
us
for
it
by
the
natural
principles
of
imitation
and
belief
which
discover
themselves
almost
in
infancy
as
well
as
by
others
which
are
of
later
growth
when
the
education
which
we
receive
from
men
does
not
give
scope
to
that
of
nature
it
is
erroneous
in
its
means
and
its
tendency
and
enervates
both
the
body
and
the
mind
nature
has
her
way
of
rearing
men
as
she
has
of
healing
their
maladies
the
art
of
education
is
to
follow
her
dictates
and
the
art
of
education
is
equally
to
obey
her
laws
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
the
baleares
followed
nature
in
their
manner
of
teaching
their
children
to
be
good
archers
when
they
hung
their
dinner
aloft
by
a
thread
and
left
them
to
bring
it
down
by
their
skill
in
the
use
of
the
bow
the
education
of
nature
without
any
more
human
care
than
is
necessary
to
preserve
life
makes
a
savage
human
education
joined
to
that
of
nature
may
make
a
good
citizen
a
skilful
artizan
or
a
man
but
a
higher
power
is
wanting
in
order
to
produce
a
bacon
or
a
newton
the
error
of
the
system
for
such
i
hope
i
may
venture
to
call
it
as
to
was
that
the
inferior
powers
of
the
mind
were
called
into
activity
in
preference
to
its
higher
faculties
the
effort
was
to
exercise
the
memory
and
store
it
with
information
which
owing
to
the
inactivity
of
the
understanding
and
the
judgment
was
seldom
or
never
of
use
to
adopt
the
opinions
of
others
was
thought
quite
enough
without
the
child
being
troubled
to
think
for
itself
and
to
form
an
opinion
of
its
own
but
this
is
not
as
it
should
be
such
a
system
is
neither
likely
to
produce
great
nor
wise
men
and
is
much
better
adapted
to
parrots
than
children
hence
the
first
thing
attempted
in
an
infant
school
is
to
set
the
children
thinking
to
induce
them
to
examine
compare
and
judge
in
reference
to
all
those
matters
which
their
dawning
intellects
are
capable
of
mastering
it
is
of
no
use
to
tell
a
child
in
the
first
place
it
should
this
is
at
once
inducing
mental
indolence
which
is
but
too
generally
prevalent
among
adults
owing
to
this
erroneous
method
having
been
adopted
by
those
who
had
the
charge
of
their
early
years
were
a
child
left
to
its
own
resources
to
discover
and
judge
of
things
exclusively
by
itself
though
the
opposite
evil
would
be
the
consequence
namely
a
state
of
comparative
ignorance
yet
i
am
doubtful
whether
it
would
be
greater
or
more
lamentable
than
that
issuing
from
the
injudicious
system
of
giving
children
dogmas
instead
of
problems
the
opinions
of
others
instead
of
eliciting
their
own
in
the
one
case
we
should
find
a
mind
uninformed
and
uncultivated
but
of
a
vigorous
and
masculine
character
grasping
the
little
knowledge
it
possessed
with
the
power
and
right
of
a
conqueror
in
the
other
a
memory
occupied
by
a
useless
heap
of
notions
without
a
single
opinion
or
idea
it
could
call
its
own
and
an
understanding
indolent
and
narrow
and
from
inactivity
almost
incapable
of
exertion
as
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
system
i
would
therefore
say
let
the
think
for
if
they
arrive
at
erroneous
conclusions
assist
them
in
attaining
the
truth
but
let
them
with
such
assistance
arrive
at
it
by
their
own
exertions
little
good
will
be
done
if
you
say
to
a
child
is
wrong
is
right
unless
you
enable
it
to
perceive
the
error
of
the
one
and
the
truth
of
the
other
it
is
not
only
due
to
the
child
as
a
rational
being
that
you
should
act
so
but
it
is
essentially
necessary
to
the
development
of
its
intellectual
faculties
it
were
not
more
ridiculous
for
a
master
in
teaching
arithmetic
to
give
his
pupil
the
problem
and
answer
without
instructing
him
in
the
method
of
working
the
question
than
it
is
for
a
person
to
give
a
child
results
of
reasoning
without
showing
how
the
truth
is
arrived
at
but
some
perhaps
will
be
ready
to
exclaim
surely
the
teacher
should
not
withhold
the
benefit
of
his
knowledge
and
experience
the
child
will
have
time
enough
to
examine
the
merits
of
his
information
when
he
grows
older
and
be
more
competent
to
do
so
to
this
i
answer
in
the
first
place
nothing
should
be
submitted
to
the
child
which
it
is
not
fully
competent
to
understand
to
give
the
child
tasks
or
subjects
too
difficult
for
its
mental
powers
is
a
violation
of
nature
and
as
foolish
and
detrimental
as
though
you
were
to
place
a
hundred
pounds
weight
on
its
shoulders
when
it
is
incapable
of
supporting
ten
the
teacher
experience
can
only
be
of
service
to
the
child
so
far
as
it
is
applicable
to
its
own
state
and
as
to
postponing
the
period
when
it
is
to
think
for
itself
there
is
certainly
no
occasion
for
it
nature
has
provided
food
adapted
to
the
powers
of
the
stomach
and
those
who
would
rightly
conduct
the
work
of
education
should
imitate
her
in
providing
its
intellectual
food
that
this
may
be
done
i
am
attempting
to
shew
in
theory
in
the
pages
of
this
work
and
that
it
answers
equally
well
in
practice
any
one
who
has
a
doubt
may
assure
himself
by
visiting
any
school
conducted
upon
the
plan
here
laid
down
the
charge
has
been
brought
against
the
system
that
we
are
not
sufficiently
anxious
to
teach
the
children
to
read
now
though
i
may
venture
to
say
that
under
no
other
plan
do
the
children
acquire
a
knowledge
of
alphabetical
characters
and
the
formation
of
words
so
soon
as
under
the
present
yet
i
am
quite
ready
to
concede
that
i
consider
their
learning
to
read
a
secondary
object
to
that
of
teaching
them
to
examine
and
find
out
the
nature
and
properties
of
things
of
which
words
are
but
the
it
is
with
and
not
merely
we
wish
to
make
our
children
acquainted
if
they
first
learn
the
nature
and
properties
of
an
object
there
is
no
fear
of
their
afterwards
inquiring
its
name
but
we
too
frequently
find
that
having
acquired
they
are
indifferent
to
and
forgetful
of
the
objects
represented
let
children
see
and
observe
an
object
and
be
taught
the
name
of
it
at
the
same
time
and
then
both
are
indelibly
fixed
on
the
memory
an
infant
at
home
is
perpetually
running
around
and
looking
at
all
things
and
hearing
persons
speaking
about
them
it
soon
becomes
acquainted
with
their
names
and
properties
and
then
from
time
to
time
speaks
about
them
ah
exclaims
papa
or
mama
what
an
child
that
is
one
would
wonder
where
it
got
such
notions
a
little
thought
and
reflection
would
soon
tell
where
and
this
thought
properly
carried
out
would
display
an
important
fundamental
principle
in
teaching
the
young
mind
our
first
endeavour
is
therefore
to
excite
a
spirit
of
inquiry
to
foster
that
curiosity
which
is
so
natural
to
young
children
till
this
is
properly
done
your
information
will
not
be
well
received
and
it
is
most
likely
soon
to
be
forgotten
but
having
once
made
them
inquisitive
you
are
more
likely
to
tire
of
communicating
than
they
are
of
receiving
the
skilful
teacher
will
indeed
rather
leave
them
with
an
appetite
still
craving
than
satiate
them
by
repletion
i
have
frequently
found
the
most
beneficial
results
arise
from
the
sudden
cessation
of
a
lesson
or
a
lecture
on
an
interesting
topic
the
children
have
looked
for
its
renewal
with
the
utmost
impatience
pondering
over
what
they
had
already
heard
and
anticipating
what
was
yet
to
come
with
the
greatest
interest
give
a
child
a
and
you
impose
a
burthen
on
him
permit
him
to
learn
something
and
you
confer
a
favour
having
excited
a
spirit
of
inquiry
the
next
endeavour
is
to
direct
it
to
proper
objects
these
of
course
will
be
things
which
relate
to
the
senses
of
the
child
the
nature
and
properties
of
bodies
which
may
be
ascertained
by
the
application
of
those
senses
having
induced
it
to
examine
for
itself
you
are
now
to
elicit
its
ideas
of
each
object
respectively
and
having
taught
it
to
use
its
reason
and
judgment
freely
and
to
express
its
own
notions
fearlessly
and
candidly
you
are
to
attempt
the
correction
of
what
is
erroneous
by
putting
forth
your
own
views
in
as
simple
a
way
as
possible
not
so
as
to
induce
the
child
to
give
up
its
own
opinions
and
adopt
yours
but
in
such
a
way
as
to
direct
it
to
the
attainment
of
truth
to
induce
a
comparison
between
its
thoughts
and
yours
and
thus
to
discover
its
own
error
the
powers
of
observation
will
speedily
be
improved
under
such
a
course
of
instruction
and
in
all
the
subsequent
stages
of
existence
will
not
fail
to
constitute
an
independent
and
shrewd
observer
but
some
may
think
we
are
straining
the
child
faculties
by
the
plan
recommended
overstepping
nature
laws
and
that
the
result
must
be
detrimental
to
the
child
both
in
mind
and
body
so
far
however
is
this
from
being
true
that
we
have
taken
nature
for
our
guide
we
deprecate
strongly
most
strongly
that
unnatural
system
which
gives
children
tasks
so
far
beyond
their
powers
and
for
which
their
infantile
faculties
are
not
qualified
we
would
lead
them
on
in
the
path
which
nature
has
marked
out
step
by
step
taking
care
that
one
thing
should
be
thoroughly
mastered
before
another
is
attempted
the
mental
powers
of
children
are
far
stronger
than
is
generally
supposed
no
one
who
looks
back
to
his
early
childhood
can
fail
of
recollecting
that
at
times
his
thoughts
would
even
then
reach
the
very
limits
of
human
thought
all
the
powers
of
mind
that
are
exercised
in
display
themselves
in
infancy
and
therefore
they
all
ought
to
be
quietly
and
easily
brought
into
exercise
this
maybe
done
by
any
object
even
a
toy
were
we
to
tie
up
several
of
our
members
so
as
to
prevent
their
use
and
at
the
same
time
exercise
strongly
those
at
liberty
bodily
distortion
must
result
if
we
in
teaching
exercise
the
memory
alone
and
that
merely
with
a
knowledge
of
words
and
not
of
things
an
absolute
mental
distortion
must
result
and
the
higher
powers
of
reflection
judgment
and
reason
will
remain
weak
feeble
and
deficient
from
want
of
exercise
when
all
the
powers
of
the
mind
are
brought
out
into
harmonious
action
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
be
comes
pleasurable
knowledge
is
the
proper
aliment
to
expand
and
enlarge
the
mind
as
natural
food
is
for
the
growth
of
the
body
and
when
such
as
is
proper
to
the
age
and
character
of
the
recipient
is
selected
the
one
will
be
received
with
as
much
pleasure
as
the
other
as
the
due
exercise
of
every
bodily
power
causes
it
to
become
strong
healthy
and
vigorous
so
the
right
and
proper
use
of
every
mental
faculty
will
in
the
end
occasion
it
to
become
active
free
and
powerful
as
soon
as
the
child
enters
the
school
he
is
under
command
he
is
required
to
occupy
certain
places
to
go
through
various
motions
and
to
attend
to
diversified
instruction
at
the
sound
of
a
foot
or
the
raising
of
a
hand
from
this
course
no
departure
is
allowed
at
first
it
is
the
work
of
sympathy
and
imitation
but
afterwards
it
becomes
a
matter
of
principle
thus
then
the
native
reluctance
of
the
infant
mind
to
obey
is
overcome
and
a
solid
basis
laid
for
future
efforts
so
far
however
the
discipline
is
general
to
be
particular
the
individual
character
must
be
minutely
observed
the
movements
of
the
child
when
unrestrained
must
be
diligently
watched
its
predominant
qualities
ascertained
and
such
a
mode
of
treatment
adopted
as
sound
judgment
of
character
may
dictate
wherever
this
is
forgotten
some
evils
will
arise
the
orders
which
are
given
to
any
other
power
than
those
of
sympathy
and
imitation
are
not
likely
to
be
obeyed
by
the
untrained
babe
the
fact
is
that
as
yet
it
has
no
other
means
of
obedience
and
for
this
on
higher
principles
we
must
wait
till
nature
furnishes
instruments
and
opportunities
for
their
exercise
when
however
success
is
gained
thus
far
the
way
is
prepared
for
further
development
and
culture
and
the
powers
of
observation
and
discrimination
then
gradually
tasked
will
accomplish
all
that
is
desired
thus
the
infant
sits
or
rises
repeats
or
is
silent
at
first
because
those
about
him
do
so
afterwards
he
perceives
a
reason
for
doing
so
for
example
that
when
in
the
gallery
he
can
see
what
he
could
not
any
where
else
and
therefore
that
he
must
march
thither
and
then
he
judges
that
one
thing
is
wrong
because
the
doing
it
was
forbidden
and
that
another
is
right
because
it
was
commanded
or
because
the
one
makes
him
happy
and
the
other
the
contrary
under
the
old
system
of
education
i
must
candidly
say
treatment
has
been
often
altogether
omitted
and
still
more
frequently
has
it
been
erroneous
and
consequently
inefficient
let
me
ask
would
it
promote
a
child
health
to
teach
it
to
repeat
certain
maxims
on
the
benefits
resulting
from
exercise
the
answer
is
obvious
neither
can
it
be
of
any
service
to
the
moral
health
of
the
child
to
teach
it
to
repeat
the
best
maxims
of
virtue
unless
we
have
taken
care
to
urge
the
practical
observance
of
those
precepts
and
yet
this
has
rarely
been
the
case
how
frequently
do
we
hear
persons
remark
on
the
ill
conduct
of
children
it
is
surprising
they
should
do
so
they
have
been
taught
better
things
very
likely
and
they
may
have
all
the
golden
rules
of
virtue
alluded
to
carefully
stored
up
in
their
memories
but
they
are
like
the
hoarded
treasures
of
the
miser
the
disposition
to
use
them
is
wanted
it
is
this
which
we
must
strive
to
produce
and
promote
in
the
child
indeed
if
we
can
but
be
the
instruments
of
exciting
a
love
of
goodness
it
will
not
err
nor
lack
the
knowledge
how
to
do
good
even
though
we
were
to
forget
to
give
it
any
rules
or
maxims
it
is
to
the
heart
we
must
turn
our
attention
in
the
moral
treatment
of
children
we
must
carefully
endeavour
to
elicit
and
train
out
the
moral
feelings
implanted
within
and
to
awaken
the
conscience
to
the
approval
of
good
and
the
dislike
and
detestation
of
evil
another
grand
object
of
the
master
or
mistress
of
an
infant
school
is
therefore
to
win
their
love
by
banishing
all
slavish
fear
they
are
to
be
invited
to
regard
their
teacher
as
one
who
is
desirous
of
promoting
their
happiness
by
the
most
affectionate
means
not
only
by
kind
words
but
by
kind
actions
one
of
which
influences
a
child
more
than
a
volume
of
words
words
appeal
only
to
the
understanding
and
frequently
pass
away
as
empty
sounds
but
kind
actions
operate
on
the
heart
and
like
the
genial
light
and
warmth
of
spring
that
dispels
the
gloom
which
has
covered
the
face
of
nature
during
the
chilly
season
of
winter
they
disperse
the
mists
which
cold
and
severe
treatment
has
engendered
in
the
moral
atmosphere
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
infant
school
system
is
nor
should
any
other
be
substituted
for
it
except
when
absolutely
necessary
let
the
children
see
that
you
love
them
and
will
beget
love
both
toward
their
teacher
and
each
other
without
the
aid
of
example
nothing
can
be
done
it
is
by
this
magnetic
power
alone
that
sympathetic
feelings
can
be
awakened
it
acts
as
a
talisman
on
the
inmost
feelings
of
the
soul
and
excites
them
to
activity
which
should
be
the
constant
aim
of
all
persons
engaged
in
the
important
work
of
education
as
we
find
that
vicious
principles
are
strengthened
by
habit
and
good
principles
proportionally
weakened
so
on
the
contrary
immoral
dispositions
are
weakened
by
the
better
feelings
being
brought
into
action
the
great
defect
in
the
human
character
is
and
to
remove
or
lessen
this
is
the
great
desideratum
of
moral
culture
how
happy
were
mankind
if
instead
of
each
one
living
for
himself
they
lived
really
for
one
another
the
perfection
of
moral
excellence
can
not
be
better
described
than
as
the
attainment
of
that
state
in
which
we
should
love
our
neighbour
as
ourselves
the
prevalence
of
will
be
very
obvious
to
the
observant
master
or
mistress
in
the
conduct
of
the
children
under
their
care
and
it
is
this
feeling
that
they
must
be
ever
striving
to
check
or
eradicate
nor
need
they
despair
of
meeting
with
some
degree
of
success
the
children
may
be
brought
to
feel
that
to
impart
happiness
is
to
receive
it
that
being
kind
to
their
little
schoolfellows
they
not
only
secure
a
return
of
kindness
but
actually
receive
a
personal
gratification
from
so
doing
and
that
there
is
more
pleasure
in
forgiving
an
injury
than
in
resenting
it
some
i
know
will
be
apt
to
say
that
after
all
thus
is
nothing
but
or
it
is
an
old
matter
of
dispute
and
i
leave
those
to
quarrel
over
it
who
please
every
one
knows
and
feels
the
difference
between
that
which
we
call
and
that
which
is
comprehensively
termed
by
the
lips
of
divine
truth
the
of
our
if
it
must
be
called
i
can
only
say
that
it
is
the
proper
direction
of
the
feeling
which
is
to
be
sought
in
the
work
of
moral
culture
it
will
be
necessary
not
only
to
observe
the
child
conduct
under
the
restraint
of
school
observation
and
discipline
but
at
those
times
when
it
thinks
itself
at
liberty
to
indulge
its
feelings
unnoticed
the
evil
propensities
of
our
nature
have
all
the
wiliness
of
the
serpent
and
lurk
in
their
secret
places
watching
for
a
favourable
opportunity
of
exercise
and
display
for
the
purpose
of
observation
the
will
afford
every
facility
and
is
on
this
account
as
well
as
because
it
affords
exercise
and
amusement
to
the
children
an
indispensable
appendage
to
an
infant
school
here
the
child
will
show
its
character
in
its
true
light
here
may
be
seen
what
effects
the
education
of
children
has
produced
for
if
they
are
fond
of
fighting
and
quarrelling
here
it
will
be
apparent
if
they
are
artful
here
they
will
seek
to
practice
their
cunning
and
this
will
give
the
master
an
opportunity
of
applying
the
proper
remedy
whereas
if
they
are
kept
in
school
which
they
must
be
if
there
be
no
these
evil
inclinations
will
not
manifest
themselves
until
they
go
into
the
street
and
consequently
the
antidote
will
not
be
applied
i
have
seen
many
children
behave
very
orderly
in
the
school
but
the
moment
they
entered
the
they
manifested
their
selfishness
to
such
a
degree
that
they
would
wish
all
the
rest
of
the
children
to
be
subservient
to
them
and
on
their
refusing
to
let
them
bear
rule
they
would
begin
to
use
force
in
order
to
compel
their
compliance
this
is
conduct
that
ought
to
be
checked
and
what
time
so
proper
as
the
first
stages
of
infancy
to
take
another
case
a
quarrel
like
this
may
arise
a
boy
has
six
gooseberries
another
boy
comes
and
asks
for
one
by
a
little
solicitation
he
obtains
it
he
wishes
another
but
the
boy
who
has
them
says
he
can
not
spare
any
more
he
has
only
five
and
can
not
part
with
another
the
second
boy
however
duns
him
he
even
acts
the
hypocrite
and
puts
into
play
many
of
the
worst
artifices
of
human
nature
which
we
so
often
see
in
daily
practice
and
he
gains
his
end
but
he
is
not
yet
satisfied
he
wishes
another
the
first
boy
however
will
on
no
account
give
him
more
he
again
tries
all
his
arts
but
in
vain
seeing
he
can
not
by
art
or
entreaty
gain
another
he
has
recourse
to
violence
he
snatches
one
out
of
his
hand
and
runs
off
with
it
the
first
boy
is
irritated
at
such
conduct
he
pursues
the
fugitive
overtakes
him
and
gives
him
a
blow
on
the
face
the
second
boy
is
as
great
a
coward
as
he
is
a
thief
he
comes
up
and
makes
his
complaint
to
the
master
the
master
then
has
a
trial
by
jury
he
does
not
knock
one
head
against
the
other
according
to
the
old
custom
but
he
hears
both
plaintiff
and
defendant
and
having
got
the
facts
he
submits
to
the
children
themselves
whether
it
was
right
in
the
one
boy
to
take
with
violence
what
was
not
his
own
and
shews
them
which
is
the
more
to
blame
then
they
decide
on
the
sentence
perhaps
some
one
suggests
that
it
should
be
the
utmost
infliction
allowable
a
slight
pat
on
the
hand
while
a
girl
says
please
sir
give
it
him
very
softly
but
the
issue
is
a
marked
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
appropriate
expressions
of
pleasure
and
disapprobation
and
on
the
spot
a
kissing
and
being
friends
i
am
indeed
so
firmly
convinced
from
the
experience
i
have
had
of
the
utility
of
a
from
the
above
reasons
and
others
elsewhere
mentioned
that
i
scruple
not
to
say
an
infant
school
is
of
little
if
any
service
without
one
where
the
is
ornamented
with
flowers
and
i
would
recommend
this
plan
to
be
invariably
adopted
it
not
only
affords
the
teacher
an
opportunity
of
communicating
much
knowledge
to
the
children
and
of
tracing
every
thing
up
to
the
great
first
cause
but
it
becomes
the
means
of
establishing
principles
of
honesty
they
should
not
on
any
account
be
allowed
to
pluck
the
fruit
or
flowers
every
thing
should
be
considered
as
sacred
and
being
thus
early
accustomed
to
honesty
temptations
in
will
be
deprived
of
their
power
it
is
distressing
to
all
lovers
of
children
to
see
what
havoc
is
made
by
them
in
plantations
near
london
and
even
grown
persons
are
not
entirely
free
from
this
fault
for
not
content
with
a
proper
they
must
walk
on
a
man
plantations
pull
up
that
which
can
be
of
no
use
and
thereby
injure
the
property
of
their
neighbour
these
things
ought
not
to
be
nor
do
i
think
they
would
be
so
common
if
they
were
noticed
a
little
more
in
the
education
of
children
it
has
been
too
much
the
practice
with
many
to
consider
that
the
business
of
a
school
consists
merely
in
teaching
children
their
letters
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
the
formation
of
character
while
there
is
of
the
greatest
importance
not
only
to
the
children
but
to
society
at
large
how
can
we
account
for
the
strict
honesty
of
the
laplanders
who
can
leave
their
property
in
the
woods
and
in
their
huts
without
the
least
fear
of
its
being
stolen
or
injured
while
we
with
ten
times
the
advantages
can
not
consider
our
property
safe
with
the
aid
of
locks
and
bolts
brick
walls
and
even
watchmen
and
besides
there
must
be
some
cause
for
all
this
and
perhaps
the
principal
one
is
defective
education
and
the
total
neglect
of
the
morals
of
the
infant
poor
at
a
time
when
their
first
impressions
should
be
taken
especial
care
of
conscience
if
not
lulled
to
sleep
but
called
into
vigorous
action
will
prove
stronger
than
brick
walls
bolts
or
locks
and
i
am
satisfied
that
i
could
have
taken
the
whole
of
the
children
under
my
care
in
the
first
infants
school
into
any
gentleman
plantation
without
their
doing
the
least
injury
whatever
and
this
i
could
now
do
in
any
similar
i
will
mention
however
one
fact
one
day
while
i
was
walking
in
the
i
saw
at
one
end
of
it
about
twenty
children
apparently
arguing
a
subject
and
from
the
attitude
of
several
of
the
orators
i
judged
it
was
about
something
that
appeared
to
them
of
considerable
importance
i
wished
to
know
the
subject
of
debate
but
was
satisfied
that
if
i
approached
the
children
it
might
put
an
end
to
the
matter
altogether
some
of
the
bystanders
saw
me
looking
very
attentively
at
the
principal
actor
and
as
i
suppose
suggested
to
the
party
the
propriety
of
retiring
to
some
other
spot
for
immediately
afterwards
they
all
went
behind
a
partition
which
afforded
me
an
opportunity
of
distinctly
hearing
all
that
passed
without
being
observed
by
them
i
soon
found
that
the
subject
of
debate
was
a
it
seems
that
one
of
the
children
had
brought
a
song
to
the
school
which
some
of
the
monitors
had
read
and
having
decided
that
it
was
an
improper
thing
for
the
child
to
have
in
his
possession
one
of
them
had
taken
it
from
the
owner
and
destroyed
it
the
aggrieved
party
had
complained
to
some
of
the
other
children
who
said
that
it
was
for
one
child
to
take
any
thing
from
another
child
without
his
consent
the
boy
nettled
at
being
called
a
thief
defended
himself
by
saying
that
he
as
a
monitor
had
a
right
to
take
away
from
any
of
his
class
any
thing
that
was
calculated
to
do
them
harm
and
was
it
seems
backed
in
this
opinion
by
many
others
on
the
other
hand
it
was
contended
that
no
such
right
existed
and
it
was
doubtful
to
me
for
a
considerable
time
on
which
side
the
strength
of
the
argument
lay
at
last
one
of
the
children
observed
to
the
following
effect
you
should
have
taken
it
to
because
he
would
know
if
it
was
bad
better
than
you
this
was
a
convincing
argument
and
to
my
great
delight
the
boy
replied
how
much
did
the
song
cost
the
reply
was
a
here
then
take
it
says
the
child
i
had
one
given
me
so
now
remember
i
have
paid
you
for
it
but
if
you
bring
any
more
songs
to
school
i
will
tell
master
this
seemed
to
give
general
satisfaction
to
the
whole
party
who
immediately
dispersed
to
their
several
amusements
a
struggle
like
this
between
the
principles
of
and
among
children
so
very
young
must
prove
highly
interesting
to
all
who
love
them
and
exemplifies
beyond
a
doubt
the
immense
advantage
of
early
instruction
another
thing
to
be
noticed
is
a
regard
for
nothing
is
so
delightful
as
this
there
is
no
conversation
so
agreeable
as
that
of
the
man
of
integrity
who
hears
without
any
design
to
betray
and
speaks
without
any
intention
to
deceive
and
this
admitted
we
should
strive
to
the
utmost
to
induce
children
to
remember
it
but
our
success
in
a
great
measure
will
depend
on
the
means
we
employ
many
children
are
frightened
into
falsehood
by
the
injudicious
methods
of
those
who
have
the
care
of
them
i
have
known
a
mother
promise
a
child
forgiveness
if
it
would
speak
the
truth
and
after
having
obtained
confession
she
has
broken
her
engagement
a
child
once
treated
in
this
manner
will
naturally
be
guarded
against
a
similar
deception
i
have
known
others
who
would
pretend
not
to
punish
the
child
for
confession
but
for
first
denying
it
and
afterwards
confessing
i
think
that
children
should
not
be
punished
on
any
account
after
having
been
promised
forgiveness
truth
being
of
too
great
importance
to
be
thus
trifled
with
and
we
can
not
wonder
if
it
is
lightly
esteemed
by
children
after
the
example
is
set
by
their
parents
having
had
several
thousand
children
under
my
care
i
have
had
favourable
opportunities
of
observing
the
bias
of
the
infant
mind
and
i
must
say
that
i
have
not
found
them
so
inclined
to
evil
and
falsehood
as
i
had
previously
imagined
when
morality
is
adverted
to
in
this
volume
let
it
never
be
forgotten
that
by
it
is
meant
the
pure
and
perfect
morality
of
the
sacred
scriptures
from
this
source
alone
the
great
truths
and
precepts
can
be
derived
for
regulating
the
conscience
and
improving
the
heart
the
infant
system
however
would
aim
to
steer
perfectly
clear
of
the
more
remote
theological
opinions
entertained
by
christians
of
different
denominations
with
these
little
children
can
have
nothing
to
do
and
institutions
for
their
express
benefit
should
receive
the
support
of
all
what
kind
of
religious
doctrine
and
faith
infants
ought
to
be
taught
i
will
not
here
determine
but
leave
it
for
consideration
in
a
future
chapter
devoted
more
expressly
to
that
subject
it
must
be
the
wish
of
all
true
christians
that
they
should
be
taught
the
fundamental
truths
of
the
everlasting
gospel
but
it
is
much
to
be
lamented
that
what
are
the
fundamental
truths
of
the
gospel
is
so
frequently
a
debatable
point
with
such
controversial
topics
infants
have
nothing
to
do
and
to
teach
such
matters
would
rather
be
sowing
seeds
for
future
scepticism
than
laying
a
solid
basis
for
pure
and
undefiled
religion
in
all
things
but
more
especially
in
religion
as
being
the
subject
of
the
highest
importance
the
purest
simplest
and
most
unadulterated
truths
should
be
taught
the
bible
contains
ample
and
abundant
stores
of
such
simple
truth
most
admirably
suited
to
infant
capacity
in
texts
precepts
parables
and
histories
the
pious
and
judicious
mother
or
teacher
can
be
at
no
loss
for
a
proper
selection
many
beautiful
and
simple
prayers
are
to
be
found
in
the
church
of
england
which
i
think
can
not
be
mended
and
which
i
have
found
quite
suitable
to
the
infant
mind
several
of
the
collects
for
simplicity
of
language
and
rich
fulness
of
divine
truth
can
not
be
surpassed
simple
hymns
for
instruction
and
devotion
are
also
requisite
and
i
have
endeavoured
to
provide
such
as
these
in
a
recently
published

connexion
with
a
friend
and
which
may
be
bad

in
the
use
of
the
most
appropriate
means
i
shall
now
lay
before
my
readers
an
account
of
the
things
necessary
for
the
establishment
of
an
infant
school
previously
to
presenting
them
with
the
detail
of
the
plan
to
be
pursued
in
it
in
the
first
place
it
is
necessary
to
provide
an
airy
and
spacious
apartment
with
a
dry
and
if
possible
a
large
attached
to
it
the
plot
of
ground
i
conceive
should
not
be
less
than
feet
wide
and
feet
long
but
if
the
ground
were
or
feet
long
it
would
be
so
much
the
better
as
this
would
allow
or
feet
for
a
which
is
of
such
importance
that
i
consider
the
system
would
be
very
defective
without
it
for
reasons
which
will
be
spoken
of
hereafter
there
should
likewise
be
a
room
about
fifteen
feet
square
for
the
purpose
of
teaching
the
children
in
classes
which
may
be
formed
at
one
end
of
the
large
room
this
is
absolutely
necessary
as
the
master
and
mistress
should
live
on
the
premises
a
small
house
containing
three
or
four
rooms
should
be
provided
for
them
the
reason
for
their
living
on
the
premises
is
that
the
children
should
be
allowed
to
bring
their
dinners
with
them
as
this
will
keep
them
out
of
the
streets
and
indeed
of
those
who
do
go
home
to
dinner
many
will
return
in
a
very
short
time
and
if
there
be
no
person
on
the
premises
to
take
care
of
them
they
will
be
lost
and
not
only
so
but
strange
boys
will
come
in
from
the
streets
and
do
a
great
deal
of
mischief
if
no
one
be
there
to
prevent
it
the
portion
of
that
i
have
allowed
for
each
child
is
twelve
inches
the
scholars
should
sit
all
round
the
school
room
with
their
backs
against
the
wall
double
seats
should
be
round
the
sides
of
the
school
like
the
two
first
seats
in
the
gallery
a
school
according
to
the
engraved
plan
will
be
found
large
enough
for
all
the
purposes
of
an
infant
school
but
if
it
is
wished
to
be
more
commodious
it
may
be
of
the
same
length
as
the
plan
and
instead
of
feet
may
be
made
thirty
feet
wide
this
will
hold
as
many
children
as
ought
to
be
collected
together
in
one
place
and
as
many
as
any
man
and
woman
can
possibly
do
justice
to
if
it
be
any
longer
it
will
be
difficult
for
all
the
children
to
hear
the
master
an
oblong
building
is
the
cheapest
on
account
of
the
roof
economy
has
been
studied
in
the
plan
given
without
any
thing
being
added
that
is
unnecessary
this
of
course
is
a
matter
of
opinion
and
may
be
acted
upon
or
not
just
as
it
suits
those
who
may
choose
to
build
the
master
house
in
the
plan
it
will
be
seen
projects
a
little
into
the
to
afford
him
the
opportunity
of
seeing
the
children
at
play
while
he
is
at
dinner
that
he
may
notice
any
improper
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
children
and
mention
it
when
the
accounts
of
the
day
are
made
up
as
children
are
very
apt
to
get
into
danger
even
when
at
school
it
becomes
expedient
to
exercise
the
utmost
vigilance
in
order
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
accident
for
where
two
hundred
children
are
assembled
together
the
eldest
not
seven
years
of
age
it
is
most
certain
that
if
there
be
danger
some
will
get
into
for
this
reason
all
the
doors
on
the
premises
should
be
so
secured
that
the
children
can
not
swing
them
backwards
and
forwards
if
they
are
not
they
will
get
their
fingers
pinched
or
greater
accidents
may
occur
the
forms
also
should
be
so
placed
that
the
children
may
not
be
likely
to
fall
over
them
every
thing
in
short
should
be
put
out
of
the
way
that
will
be
likely
to
occasion
any
danger
the
seats
should
not
be
more
than
nine
inches
high
and
for
the
smaller
children
six
inches
and
should
be
eleven
or
twelve
inches
wide
and
fixed
all
round
to
the
walls
the
master
desk
should
be
placed
at
the
end
of
the
school
where
the
is
by
this
means
he
will
be
able
to
see
the
faces
of
all
the
children
and
they
can
see
him
which
is
absolutely
necessary
they
may
then
be
governed
by
a
motion
of
his
hand
the
necessary
for
the
school
consists
of
a
desk
for
the
master
seats
for
the
children
stools
for
the
monitors
slates
and
pencils
pictures
and
lessons
on
scriptural
subjects
pictures
and

history
alphabets
and
spelling
lessons
brass

and
figures
with

for
them
geometrical
figures
and
the

arithmeticon
as
it
has
been
called

these

added
little
books

of
these

any
position
which
is
most
convenient
and

any

as
the
master
may
see

is

slip
of

with
a

in
it
fixed

to
the
width
of

instead
of
being
made
with

the
lesson
post
is
generally

perhaps
better
fixed
into
the
floor
of

be
very
slight

been
found
to
answer
better
than

illustration
the
arithmeticon
of
which
a
description
will
be
given
in
a
subsequent
chapter
is
simple
in
its
construction
but
as
will
be
seen
hereafter
may
be
variously
and
beneficially
applied
it
is
indeed
indispensable
in
an
infant
school
as
it
is
useful
for
teaching
the
first
principles
of
grammar
arithmetic
and
geometry
the
expense
of
furnishing
a
large
school
is
about
that
of
a
smaller
one
about
i
must
here
protest
against
a
violation
of
the
freedom
of
the
infant
mind
a
fold
as
it
is
called
is
erected
in
some
schools
for
the
youngest
of
the
children
and
thus
they
are
cut
off
from
the
society
of
the
rest
from
whom
they
would
learn
much
more
than
they
could
from
any
teacher
the
monitors
having
charge
of
this
class
are
also
cooped
up
in
the
same
cage
and
therefore
suffer
the
same
privation
the
result
of
my
own
experience
as
well
as
that
of
others
is
that
a
child
is
decidedly
incompetent
to
the
duties
of
a
monitor
if
he
can
not
keep
the
youngest
class
in
order
without
any
such
means
i
would
therefore
deprecate
in
the
strongest
terms
the
separation
referred
to
as
not
only
altogether
unnecessary
but
exceedingly
injurious
to
have
one
hundred
children
or
upwards
in
a
room
however
convenient
in
other
respects
and
not
to
allow
the
children
proper
relaxation
and
exercise
which
they
could
not
have
without
a
would
materially
injure
their
health
which
is
a
thing
in
my
humble
opinion
of
the
first
importance
i
would
rather
see
a
school
where
they
charged
or
per
week
for
each
child
having
a
than
one
where
the
children
had
free
admission
without
one
for
i
think
the
former
institution
would
do
the
most
good
the
play
ground
likewise
is
one
of
the
most
useful
parts
of
the
system
it
is
there
the
child
shews
itself
in
its
true
character
and
thereby
gives
the
master
an
opportunity
of
nipping
in
the
bud
its
evil
propensities
i
am
therefore
most
anxious
to
recommend
that
this
necessary
appendage
to
an
infant
school
should
not
be
dispensed
with
i
moreover
observe
that
where
there
is
a
attached
to
the
school
instead
of
playing
in
the
streets
where
scarcely
anything
but
evil
is
before
their
eyes
the
children
will
hasten
to
the
school
with
their
bread
and
butter
in
their
hands
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
they
have
left
it
knowing
that
they
have
an
opportunity
of
playing
there
the
remainder
of
their
so
that
they
love
the
school
and
but
rarely
wish
to
be
anywhere
else
the
of
some
schools
are
paved
with
bricks
which
i
have
found
to
answer
very
well
as
they
absorb
the
rain
so
quickly
that
ten
minutes
after
a
shower
the
place
is
dry
enough
for
the
children
to
play
in
which
perhaps
would
not
be
the
case
with
any
other
kind
of
paving
they
are
commonly
placed
flat
on
the
ground
but
i
should
prefer
them
being
put
as
they
would
last
many
years
longer
yet
it
would
take
nearly
double
the
number
of
bricks
were
they
so
placed
a
if
it
be
not
paved
the
ground
will
be
soft
and
the
children
will
make
themselves
dirty
it
should
be
so
managed
that
the
water
may
be
carried
off
for
if
there
are
any
puddles
the
children
will
get
into
them
some
persons
have
recommended
a
few
of
good
gravel
there
being
a
sort
which
will
bind
almost
like
a
rock
if
well
rolled
but
the
children
are
liable
to
dig
holes
if
it
is
only
gravel
if
this
is
noticed
in
time
it
may
be
prevented
but
if
they
are
suffered
to
proceed
and
no
notice
be
taken
of
it
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
prevent
them
from
continuing
the
practice
if
money
can
be
saved
by
any
plan
perhaps
it
is
as
well
to
notice
it
but
after
having
weighed
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
gravelling
i
am
of
opinion
that
bricks
are
preferable
i
should
also
recommend
that
be
planted
in
the
centre
of
the
and
likewise
round
the
walls
which
will
delight
the
children
and
teach
them
to
respect
private
property
if
any
person
doubts
the
propriety
of
this
plan
i
can
only
say
we
leave
many
thus
ornamented
and
instead
of
proving
a
temptation
to
the
children
it
has
so
far
become
the
means
of
confirming
principles
of
honesty
in
them
that
they
never
touch
a
single
flower
or
even
a
leaf
in
the
garden
there
should
also
be
a
border
of
flowers
round
the
of
such
sorts
as
will
yield
the
most
fragrance
which
will
tend
to
counteract
any
disagreeable
smell
that
may
proceed
from
the
children
and
thereby
be
conducive
to
their
health
as
well
as
to
that
of
those
who
have
the
charge
of
them
they
will
besides
afford
the
teacher
an
opportunity
of
giving
the
children
many
useful
lessons
for
the
more
he
teaches
by
things
and
the
less
he
teaches
by
signs
the
better
these
things
need
be
no
expense
to
the
establishment
except
the
purchase
in
the
first
instance
for
they
will
afford
an
agreeable
occupation
for
the
master
before
and
after
prepare
him
in
some
measure
for
the
duties
of
the
day
and
afford
him
an
ample
opportunity
of
instilling
a
variety
of
ideas
into
the
minds
of
the
children
and
of
tracing
every
thing
up
to
the
great
first
cause
i
have
witnessed
the
good
effects
of
these
things
which
makes
me
desirous
of
humbly
but
earnestly
recommending
them
to
others

my
conviction
of
the
great
importance
of
the
and
of
the
folly
of
some
of
my
early
views
respecting
it
finding
a
great
variety
of
lessons
and
objects
necessary
to
arrest
the
attention
of
children
diversified
as
they
are
in
disposition
and
taste
it
was
supposed
that
an
equal
variety
of
toys
was
required
for
the
a
good
supply
of
balls
battledores
shuttlecocks
tops
whips
hoops
sticks
and
wheelbarrows
was
therefore
obtained
and
we
flattered
ourselves
that
this
must
produce
universal
happiness
in
thus
however
we
were
most
grievously
disappointed
for
the
balls
frequently
bounced
over
the
wall
the
players
not
being
able
to
throw
them
with
the
precision
of
spartan
children

struck
their
comrades
perhaps
in
the
eye
if
we
could
succeed
in
quieting
the
sufferer
by

the
inability
of
another
to
get
any
thing
it
was
evident
that
we
were
wrong
but
not
so
clear
how
we
could
do
otherwise
it
then
occurred
that
we
might
provide
some
about
four
inches
long
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
and
two
inches
and
a
half
wide
and
of
these
a
thousand
were
obtained

exceedingly
amused

the
variety
of
forms
in
which
they
may
be
placed

may
be
erected
with
them

always
be
at
the
rear
of
the
premises

as
private
as
possible
that
both
teachers
and
pupils
be
secure
from
annoyance
of
any
kind
the
entrance
should
be
only
through
the
school
and
no
other
way
this
secures
the
flowers
the
fruits
and
the
moral
training
of
the
children
illustration
in
addition
to
these
all
that
is
required
is
a
rotatory
swing
of
which
the
above
is
a
representation
to
make
one
a
pole
eighteen
or
twenty
feet
long
should
be
firmly
fixed
in
the
ground
three
feet
of
the
should
be
sunk
secured
by
sleepers
to
keep
it
steady
it
should
be
at
least
three
quarters
of
a
yard
in
girth
at
bottom
and
taper
gradually
to
the
top
to
half
that
size
an
iron
rim
is
to
be
driven
on
the
head
of
the
pole
to
keep
it
from
splitting
and
then
a
spindle
at
least
an
inch
in
diameter
with
a
shoulder
is
to
be
fixed
in
it
an
iron
wheel
with
four
spokes
turned
up
at
the
end
like
a
hook
to
which
four
ropes
are
to
be
fastened
must
then
be
made
to
revolve
on
the
spindle
as
the
ropes
reach
the
ground
four
children
may
take
hold
of
them
and
run
round
until
they
bear
the
whole
weight
of
the
body
on
the
arms
and
this
exercise
will
be
found
to
strengthen
the
muscles
and
give
vigour
to
the
whole
frame
in
a
large
school
there
should
be
two
swings
of
this
kind
one
for
the
girls
and
the
other
for
the
boys
the
teachers
must
however
be
careful
the
first
few
weeks
to
train
the
children
to
look
about
them
this
they
are
but
little
disposed
to
do
hence
the
most
impressive
manner
should
be
adopted
and
i
will
venture
to
say
should
any
injury
be
sustained
by
the
children
the
fault
not
be
the
effect
of
the
instruction
thus
urged
will
be
valuable
in
other
cases
for
a
child
thus
taught
to
watch
against
accident
will
be
careful
in
passing
crossings
and
going
through
crowded
streets
and
thus
be
likely
to
escape
many
dangers
into
which
others
fall
this
exercise
may
also
be
accompanied
by
instruction
as
the
children
may
repeat
the
cow
or
the
sheep
or
any
other
lesson
as
the
measure
of
the
time
during
which
four
may
have
the
swing
it
will
moreover
afford
an
opportunity
for
detecting
the
selfishness
of
some
children
by
their
wishing
to
keep
the
ropes
too
long
and
the
passion
of
others
from
the
vehemence
with
which
they
will
insist
on
their
rights
but
as
on
such
occasion
both
are
to
be
forbidden
to
swing
any
more
that
day
they
will
soon
learn
to
bear
and
forbear
in
the
event
of
a
child
being
thrown
down
from
standing
in
the
way
all
the
children
should
be
placed
in
the
gallery
and
this
one
shewn
them
if
it
appear
hurt
all
will
pity
it
let
then
the
question
be
put
how
did
this
happen
and
the
answer
will
be
perhaps
please
sir
because
he
did
not
make
use
of
his
eyes
here
then
is
full
opportunity
to
inculcate
caution
and
to
inform
and
benefit
the
whole
for
example
the
master
may
say
how
many
senses
have
we
the
children
will
answer
five
name
them
hearing
seeing
smelling
tasting
and
feeling
where
are
the
organs
of
sight
here
pointing
to
the
eyes
look
at
this
child
and
see
if
he
has
them
here
an
inspection
will
take
place
the
sufferer
will
look
sheepish
and
begin
to
perceive
he
has
not
made
the
best
use
of
the
sense
of
seeing
whilst
the
singular
observations
of
the
children
will
sharpen
his
faculties
and
make
such
an
impression
as
to
cause
him
to
be
more
cautious
in
future
and
many
a
scholar
who
is
sitting
in
judgment
will
profit
by
the
circumstance
i
have
known
the
lives
of
several
children
saved
by
such
simple
lessons
and
they
are
of
as
much
importance
as
any
that
are
taught
though
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
all
the
teachers
will
think
so
too
many
to
save
trouble
will
find
fault
with
the
swing
and
i
have
known
several
instances
where
the
swing
had
been
taken
down
in
consequence
we
have
found
the
swing
answer
in
all
three
countries
it
strengthens
the
muscles
which
in
physical
education
is
a
matter
of
the
highest
importance
it
has
been
introduced
into
juvenile
schools
with
similar
success
and
also
in
ladies
i
have
personally
inspected
tine
effects
produced
under
all
these
circumstances
and
in
every
instance
i
have
found
the
most
beneficial
effects
produced
provided
the
exercise
was
properly
regulated
and
superintended
it
will
not
do
therefore
to
have
this
important
part
of
the
system
dispensed
with
the
teachers
must
be
present
at
all
the
exercises
in
the
or
more
properly
speaking
the
to
this
is
a
capital
error
and
if
persisted
in
must
be
followed
with
dismissal

i
enter
on
this
chapter
with
a
full
recollection
of
the
painful
sense
of
incompetency
i
endured
on
becoming
a
teacher
of
babes
and
this
i
trust
will
enable
me
to
offer
any
remarks
on
the
present
subject
with
the
humility
that
is
desirable
blended
with
the
confidence
of
experience
it
is
a
very
common
idea
that
almost
any
person
can
educate
little
children
and
that
it
requires
little
or
no
ability
but
it
will
be
found
on
an
enlightened
and
correct
estimate
of
the
work
that
this
is
a
very
great
mistake
and
i
regret
that
this
mistake
has
been
made
by
those
who
professed
to
understand
the
system
and
who
have
written
upon
it
but
there
is
just
this
slight
difference
between
theory
and
practice
theory
supposes
such
and
such
things
to
be
correct
which
was
my
own
case
but
twelve
months
only
of
practical
effort
very
soon
convinced
me
i
was
wrong
how
frequently
for
instance
may
we
find
children
ten
or
twelve
years
of
age
who
can
not
answer
the
most
simple
question
and
who
nevertheless
have
been
to
school
for
several
years
to
give
the
children
correct
notions
is
a
part
of
education
seldom
thought
of
but
if
we
really
wish
to
form
the
character
of
the
rising
generation
and
to
improve
the
condition
of
society
generally
the
utmost
attention
must
be
given
to
this
object
little
i
should
think
need
be
said
to
prove
that
few
ideas
are
given
in
there
may
be
a
few
as
to
which
an
exception
should
be
made
but
generally
speaking
where
the
children
of
mechanics
are
usually
sent
before
the
age
of
seven
years
no
such
thing
is
thought
of
the
mind
of
a
child
is
compared
by
locke
to
a
sheet
of
blank
paper
and
if
it
be
the
business
of
a
tutor
to
inscribe
valuable
lessons
on
the
mind
it
will
require
much
patience
gentleness
perseverance
energy
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
above
all
piety
simple
sincere
and
practical
piety
to
accomplish
so
great
a
work
with
propriety
and
success
whoever
is
in
possession
of
these
requisites
with
the
addition
of
a
lively
temper
pleasing
countenance
and
some
knowledge
of
music
may
be
considered
as
a
proper
person
to
manage
an
infant
school
and
whoever
has
charge
of
such
an
institution
will
find
numerous
opportunities
of
displaying
each
and
all
of
these
qualifications
it
would
be
almost
useless
to
attempt
to
cure
the
bad
tempers
of
children
if
the
master
should
encourage
and
manifest
such
evil
tempers
in
his
own
conduct
for
children
are
not
indifferent
to
what
they
see
in
others
they
certainly
take
notice
of
all
our
movements
and
consequently
the
greatest
caution
is
necessary
it
will
be
of
little
purpose
to
endeavour
to
inculcate
suitable
precepts
in
the
minds
of
the
children
unless
they
see
them
shine
forth
in
the
conduct
of
the
teacher
how
strangely
it
would
sound
if
when
a
teacher
was
explaining
to
his
pupils
the
sin
of
swearing
a
child
should
say
please
sir
i
heard
you
swear
and
it
is
just
the
same
as
to
those
faults
which
some
may
consider
of
minor
importance
such
as
the
indulgence
of
angry
passions
in
the
presence
of
children
it
must
always
be
understood
that
the
essence
of
the
plan
is
to
allow
the
children
to
speak
not
what
they
do
not
feel
and
think
which
has
been
but
too
general
but
what
they
do
think
and
feel
this
children
will
always
do
if
rightly
trained
yes
with
modesty
and
decorum
but
with
power
what
will
the
old
class
of
pedagogues
say
to
this
what
allow
pupils
to
tell
you
of
your
faults
certainly
they
know
them
at
least
those
committed
in
their
presence
they
talk
of
them
to
themselves
why
not
to
us
some
of
the
best
i
ever
got
were
under
similar
circumstances
persons
in
such
circumstances
can
not
be
too
circumspect
as
every
trifling
fault
will
be
magnified
both
by
parents
and
children
indeed
character
is
of
so
much
importance
that
the
designs
of
benevolent
individuals
are
very
often
frustrated
by
appointing
improper
persons
to
fill
such
situations
i
have
seen
more
than
once
the
interests
of
two
hundred
babes
sacrificed
to
serve
one
individual
and
persons
have
been
chosen
merely
because
they
had
been
unfortunate
and
to
serve
them
they
have
been
placed
in
a
situation
disagreeable
to
themselves
and
unprofitable
to
the
children
it
is
one
thing
to
possess
certain
information
but
it
is
another
to
be
able
to
communicate
that
information
to
infants
patience
is
a
virtue
absolutely
indispensable
as
it
will
frequently
take
the
master
or
mistress
a
whole
hour
to
investigate
a
subject
that
may
appear
of
little
or
no
importance
such
as
one
child
accusing
another
of
stealing
a
trifle
as
a
plum
a
cherry
a
button
or
any
other
thing
of
little
value
the
complainant
and
defendant
will
expect
justice
done
to
them
by
the
master
or
mistress
and
in
order
to
do
this
much
time
and
trouble
will
in
some
cases
be
necessary
should
a
hasty
conclusion
be
formed
and
the
accused
be
punished
for
what
he
has
not
been
guilty
of
the
child
will
be
sensible
that
an
injury
has
been
done
him
feel
dissatisfied
with
his
tutors
and
consequently
will
not
pay
them
the
respect
they
ought
to
have
besides
it
will
frequently
be
found
on
examination
that
the
accuser
is
really
the
most
in
fault
and
i
think
i
have
convinced
many
children
that
this
has
been
the
case
and
they
have
retired
satisfied
with
my
decision
for
when
a
child
is
convinced
that
justice
will
be
done
him
he
will
open
his
case
freely
and
boldly
but
if
he
has
any
idea
that
it
will
be
otherwise
he
will
keep
one
half
of
the
facts
in
his
own
mind
and
will
not
reveal
them
i
once
formed
a
hasty
conclusion
in
the
case
of
two
children
and
happened
to
decide
directly
contrary
to
what
i
ought
to
have
done
the
consequence
was
that
the
injured
child
endeavoured
to
do
that
for
himself
which
he
found
i
had
not
done
for
him
and
pleaded
his
own
cause
with
the
opposite
party
in
the
but
finding
that
he
could
not
prevail
on
him
and
being
sensible
that
he
had
been
wronged
he
was
so
much
hurt
that
he
brought
his
father
the
next
day
and
we
the
case
when
it
was
found
that
the
child
was
correct
and
that
i
was
wrong
here
i
found
how
necessary
it
was
to
exercise
the
utmost
patience
in
order
to
enable
me
to
judge
rightly
and
to
convince
my
little
pupils
that
i
had
the
greatest
desire
to
do
them
justice
i
compare
an
infant
school
to
a
little
commonwealth
the
head
or
governor
of
which
is
naturally
the
master
an
infant
school
master
or
mistress
is
not
to
consider
anything
relating
to
the
rights
of
his
little
community
as
trifling
or
unimportant
however
justly
it
might
be
considered
such
in
itself
yet
comparatively
it
is
a
matter
of
moment
to
the
parties
concerned
and
such
therefore
it
should
be
esteemed
by
him
who
is
the
arbitrator
of
their
rights
and
the
legislator
and
judge
of
the
infant
state
he
will
have
indeed
to
act
the
part
of
counsel
judge
and
jury
and
although
the
children
can
not
find
words
to
plead
their
own
cause
yet
by
their
looks
and
gestures
they
will
convince
you
that
they
know
when
you
have
rightly
decided
and
it
appears
to
me
that
the
future
conduct
of
the
children
in
the
world
will
depend
in
a
great
measure
upon
the
correctness
of
the
master
decisions
one
would
suppose
to
hear
the
observations
of
some
persons
that
mere
automatons
would
do
for
masters
and
mistresses
by
them
the
system
is
considered
as
every
thing
while
the
persons
who
are
to
teach
it
have
been
considered
as
secondary
objects
but
a
system
however
perfect
in
itself
will
be
productive
of
little
good
unless
it
be
committed
to
persons
possessed
of
some
degree
of
skill
as
the
best
watch
will
go
wrong
if
not
properly
attended
to
we
can
not
therefore
be
too
circumspect
in
the
choice
of
the
persons
to
whom
we
commit
the
care
and
education
of
the
rising
generation
there
is
something
so
powerful
in
correctness
of
deportment
that
even
infants
respect
it
and
this
will
operate
more
on
their
minds
than
many
imagine
it
does
not
appear
necessary
to
me
that
children
should
be
kept
under
excessive
restraint
by
their
tutors
they
should
rather
be
encouraged
to
make
their
teacher
their
confidant
for
by
this
means
he
will
become
acquainted
with
many
things
the
knowledge
of
which
it
is
essential
he
should
possess
both
as
it
regards
himself
and
the
welfare
of
his
pupils
if
the
child
be
enthralled
he
will
seek
some
other
persons
to
whom
he
may
open
his
little
mind
and
should
that
person
be
the
most
serious
consequences
will
not
unfrequently
follow
i
know
the
source
from
whence
all
assistance
is
derived
and
i
am
taught
to
believe
that
such
assistance
will
not
be
withheld
from
those
who
diligently
seek
it
i
am
well
aware
that
i
shall
have
to
render
an
account
of
my
stewardship
to
the
almighty
for
every
child
that
may
have
been
placed
under
my
care
and
i
feel
that
to
do
so
unblameably
requires
much
assistance
from
above
let
not
those
then
who
are
similarly
circumstanced
with
myself
think
that
i
address
them
in
the
spirit
of
arrogance
with
a
opinion
of
my
own
sufficiency
i
wish
that
all
who
teach
may
be
more
fit
for
the
situation
than
i
am
i
know
many
who
are
an
honour
to
their
profession
as
well
as
the
situation
they
fill
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
think
they
do
not
all
meet
with
the
encouragement
they
merit
it
is
not
always
those
who
do
their
duty
the
best
that
are
most
valued
but
if
a
man
conscience
do
not
upbraid
him
he
has
in
its
approval
a
high
reward
and
now
as
to
a
matter
on
which
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
whether
women
are
or
are
not
as
fit
for
conductors
of
infant
schools
as
men
my
decided
opinion
is
that
they
are
not
there
should
be
in
every
school
a
master
and
a
mistress
in
the
first
place
in
an
infant
school
the
presence
of
the
man
as
of
a
father
in
a
family
will
insure
a
far
greater
degree
of
respect
and
attention
on
the
part
of
the
children
this
does
not
arise
from
the
exercise
of
any
greater
degree
of
harshness
or
severity
than
a
mother
would
be
capable
of
using
nor
is
it
to
be
attributed
as
some
suppose
to
the
less
frequent
presence
of
the
father
in
the
case
of
many
families
but
is
rather
to
be
accounted
for
by
an
intuitive
perception
of
the
greater
firmness
and
determination
of
the
character
of
the
man
to
those
who
deny
this
i
would
give
as
a
problem
for
solution
a
case
by
no
means
unfrequent
and
which
most
of
my
readers
will
have
witnessed
a
family
in
which
the
mother
by
no
means
incurring
the
charge
of
spoiling
the
child
by
sparing
the
rod
is
less
heeded
less
promptly
obeyed
in
her
commands
than
a
father
who
seldom
or
never
makes
use
of
any
such
means
the
mother
scolds
threatens
scourges
and
is
at
last
reluctantly
and
imperfectly
obeyed
the
father
either
with
reference
to
his
own
commands
or
seconding
those
of
the
mother
and
is
instantly
regarded
the
idea
of
disputing
his
authority
or
neglecting
or
disobeying
his
laws
never
once
enters
the
minds
of
his
children
exactly
the
same
is
it
in
an
infant
school
the
presence
of
a
man
insures
attention
and
gains
respect
from
the
children
not
only
at
first
whilst
the
novelty
of
such
control
might
be
supposed
to
operate
but
permanently
as
i
am
sure
all
who
have
candidly
examined
the
schools
where
two
women
preside
and
those
conducted
by
a
man
and
a
woman
must
have
seen
another
objection
to
the
sole
government
of
females
i
mean
the
class
of
females
who
are
likely
to
accept
such
situations
in
these
schools
is
they
have
not
the
physical
strength
nor
at
present
intellectual
powers
sufficient
for
the
task
in
saying
thus
i
trust
i
shall
not
be
suspected
of
wishing
to
offend
my
fair
countrywomen
that
they
have
not
sufficient
physical
strength
is
the
intention
of
nature
that
they
are
deficient
in
mental
energy
is
the
defect
of
education
i
trust
therefore
that
no
offence
will
be
assumed
where
no
blame
is
attached
it
has
been
a
point
much
disputed
whether
there
be
really
an
original
and
intrinsic
difference
in
the
mental
powers
of
the
two
sexes
and
it
has
been
of
course
differently
decided
by
the
respective
disputants
with
this
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
but
these
things
are
certain
that
the
minds
of
are
capable
of
much
greater
activity
and
more
important
results
than
have
been
generally
supposed
and
that
whilst
education
has
not
done
what
it
ought
for
man
it
has
done
far
less
for
woman
this
it
is
then
which
affords
an
additional
argument
in
my
mind
for
a
master
and
a
mistress
for
let
it
not
be
imagined
that
i
would
dismiss
women
altogether
from
the
system
that
i
think
them
useless
or
even
dispensable
in
an
infant
school
if
indeed
one
or
the
other
be
done
without
and
i
had
my
choice
i
should
certainly
give
my
voice
for
a
woman
but
to
carry
the
system
into
full
effect
requires
there
is
ample
opportunity
for
the
offices
of
maternal
love
of
which
man
is
at
best
but
a
poor
imitator
neither
can
it
be
denied
that
an
active
intelligent
woman
is
a
useful
auxiliary
to
the
labours
of
the
man
in
the
duties
of
the
school
the
authoritative
presence
of
the
man
is
the
more
necessary
in
the
infant
system
because
one
grand
object
is
to
rule
without
harshness
and
by
that
principle
of
love
which
is
in
no
degree
incompatible
with
the
respect
felt
for
a
kind
but
judicious
schoolmaster
some
children
indeed
so
far
as
regards
authority
might
be
very
well
managed
by
a
mistress
only
but
then
it
must
be
recollected
that
an
infant
school
exhibits
every
variety
of
temper
and
disposition
and
even
were
it
otherwise
the
objection
as
to
intellectual
incompetence
and
physical
strength
before
adverted
to
would
still
hold
good
such
indeed
is
the
opinion
of
the
unfitness
of
females
for
the
occupation
of
teaching
in
scotland
that
in
many
places
the
very
idea
of
it
is
scouted
the
people
of
that
country
have
scarcely
heard
of
a
even
for
the
youngest
children
and
certain
it
is
that
education
is
much
better
conducted
in
scotland
than
in
most
other
places
if
the
minds
of
children
are
to
be
cultivated
and
a
firm
and
decided
tone
given
to
their
characters
say
they
what
can
be
the
use
of
sending
them
to
a
school
conducted
by
a
woman
only
and
i
must
candidly
admit
that
i
perfectly
agree
with
them
on
this
head
and
have
therefore
deemed
it
my
duty
to
be
thus
explicit
on
the
matter
a
footnote
a
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
at
this
time
the
people
of
scotland
have
been
led
into
the
same
error
of
which
i
have
complained
i
did
hope
they
would
never
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
led
away
from
their
old
judicious
and
workable
plans
far
the
sake
of
party
or
fashion
but
so
it
is
and
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
however
it
is
a
consolation
to
know
that
it
is
not
universal
one
thing
i
must
add
by
way
of
conclusion
to
render
any
man
or
woman
competent
to
discharge
the
duties
of
the
situation
efficiently
the
of
the
teacher
must
be
in
the
school
if
there
be
not
the
zeal
of
the
amateur
the
skill
of
the
professor
will
be
of
little
avail
the
maxim
will
apply
to
every
species
of
occupation
but
it
is
peculiarly
true
as
to
that
of
an
infant
school
teacher
to
those
who
can
feel
no
other
interest
than
that
which
the
profit
gives
to
the
employment
it
will
soon
become
not
only
irksome
but
exceedingly
distasteful
but
certain
i
am
that
it
is
possible
to
feel
it
to
be
what
it
is
an
employment
not
only
most
important
but
likewise
most
interesting
it
is
one
which
a
philosopher
might
choose
for
the
study
of
the
human
character
and
a
philanthropist
for
its
improvement
one
word
more
and
i
have
done
i
have
seen
what
i
could
have
wished
had
been
otherwise
not
sufficient
discrimination
used
in
giving
improper
times
have
been
chosen
too
much
has
been
made
of
it
too
much
freedom
has
been
used
with
divine
and
i
have
sometimes
been
so
shocked
at
the
levity
displayed
as
to
have
considered
it
little
less
than
i
wish
to
lay
the
utmost
stress
on
what
has
been
stated
as
a
failure
on
the
part
of
a
master
and
mistress
is
most
grievous
and
lamentable
i
have
seen
schools
where
little
or
nothing
has
been
done
because
of
the
inefficiency
of
the
teachers
moral
and
religious
qualifications
are
confessedly
of
the
first
importance
but
those
which
are
mental
are
to
be
highly
estimated
i
differ
with
a
gentleman
who
has
written
on
this
subject
when
he
says
that
any
clever
boy
who
has
been
educated
in
a
national
school
will
accomplish
the
end
because
the
system
through
which
he
has
passed
neither
gives
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
nor
of
nor
does
it
sufficiently
develop
the
faculties
to
prepare
him
for
such
a
service
one
cause
of
failure
in
these
respects
has
been
undoubtedly
the
paltry
remuneration
which
some
receive
and
i
would
earnestly
recommend
the
supporters
and
conductors
of
infant
schools
to
try
the
effect
of
liberality
by
all
the
means
they
can
command
persons
of
talent
ought
to
be
found
for
this
work
and
then
they
should
be
appropriately
paid
but
if
are
to
be
deemed
suitable
and
if
the
having
them
at
a
low
rate
be
a
special
reason
for
their
engagement
it
would
be
better
at
once
to
revert
to
the
old
system
than
to
destroy
by
such
means
the
public
confidence
in
the
plans
now
suggested
i
entertain
a
full
conviction
that
the
infant
system
will
flourish
most
where
i
once
least
expected
its
adoption
i
mean
in
scotland
because
of
the
high
importance
attached
to
the
essential
qualifications
of
teachers
and
because
of
the
attention
and
kindness
which
they
continually
receive
it
is
to
be
lamented
that
most
of
the
schools
connected
with
the
established
church
are
managed
by
women
only
whilst
the
schools
connected
with
the
dissenters
are
generally
conducted
by
a
man
and
woman
the
consequence
is
that
the
children
educated
under
the
dissenters
will
be
better
taught
than
those
connected
with
the
established
church
which
is
an
error
i
should
be
glad
to
see
remedied
as
soon
as
possible
i
have
no
need
to
speak
in
favour
of
infant
school
masters
as
many
of
them
have
been
the
greatest
enemies
i
ever
had
whilst
on
the
contrary
the
mistresses
have
generally
been
very
friendly
to
me
and
not
been
subject
to
those
petty
jealousies
which
the
masters
have
too
frequently
evinced
nevertheless
the
subject
treated
of
in
this
place
involves
a
principle
which
can
not
be
conceded
without
doing
great
injury
to
the
infant
system
and
on
those
grounds
i
advocate
the
necessity
of
a
master
in
conjunction
with
the
mistress
many
teachers
and
other
persons
who
have
written
on
the
subject
have
talked
largely
of
making
improvements
whilst
the
hints
given
in
this
book
have
been
entirely
neglected
as
this
was
the
first
book
that
ever
was
written
on
the
subject
and
the
writer
of
it
the
first
man
that
ever
brought
the
thing
practically
to
bear
it
sounds
a
little
odd
that
people
should
talk
about
improvements
before
they
have
pointed
out
the
errors
of
the
original
inventor
others
again
have
borrowed
largely
from
me
and
have
neither
had
the
good
manners
nor
the
common
honesty
to
say
from
whence
they
got
their
information
societies
have
been
formed
at
the
eleventh
hour
after
the
infant
system
had
been
twenty
years
in
practice
who
puff
off
books
written
by
some
of
their
own
members
which
do
not
contain
the
original
idea
whilst
my
books
for
some
cause
best
known
to
themselves
have
never
been
recommended
or
indeed
ever
mentioned
though
i
could
take
page
after
page
from
those
modern
writers
on
the
subject
and
justly
claim
them
as
my
own
this
is
not
what
one
ought
to
expect
amongst
people
who
call
themselves
christians
a
truly
good
man
is
delighted
to
do
justice
to
his
because
in
doing
so
he
never
fails
to
obtain
justice
himself
but
there
are
some
persons
whose
minds
are
so
truly
selfish
that
they
can
not
see
how
good
can
accrue
to
themselves
if
they
do
what
is
right
to
others
and
i
regret
to
say
i
have
met
with
not
a
few
who
have
been
engaged
in
the
art
of
teaching
who
have
been
guilty
of
the
mean
and
contemptible
conduct
i
have
hinted
at
above
and
it
is
to
deter
others
from
falling
into
the
same
errors
that
i
have
ventured
to
allude
to
this
subject
at
all
it
would
be
invidious
to
mention
names
which
i
could
very
easily
do
and
should
this
be
persisted
in
if
i
am
spared
i
shall
most
certainly
mention
the
parties
by
name
i
would
not
be
understood
to
say
that
no
improvements
can
be
made
in
the
infant
system
far
from
it
no
doubt
it
will
be
improved
and
that
to
a
great
extent
but
that
will
only
be
in
process
of
time
and
by
practical
people
who
understand
more
of
the
nature
of
the
infant
mind
than
i
do
and
may
hereafter
have
greater
experience
than
i
have
had
but
they
must
work
hard
for
it
as
i
have
done
and
be
doers
as
well
as
talkers
and
when
i
see
such
improvements
made
i
trust
the
almighty
will
enable
me
to
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
them
at
present
however
though
i
have
travelled
over
a
large
space
and
visited
many
hundred
schools
and
also
opened
many
hundred
and
have
not
yet
seen
the
mighty
improvements
of
which
i
have
read
so
much
and
i
do
beg
that
those
teachers
who
may
be
engaged
in
the
system
will
be
kind
enough
to
try
my
plans
prior
to
introducing
so
many
crotchets
of
their
own
they
are
to
recollect
we
never
intended
to
make
prodigies
of
the
little
children
it
never
was
our
object
to
teach
them
things
that
were
only
fit
for
men
and
women
the
fact
must
never
be
lost
sight
of
that
they
are
infants
and
that
as
infants
they
must
be
treated
it
is
very
easy
for
any
one
to
theorise
and
form
schemes
for
the
education
of
children
and
to
introduce
changes
which
may
appear
beneficial
fancy
is
very
prolific
and
a
number
of
books
may
easily
be
read
and
yet
the
right
knowledge
not
be
gained
the
chief
book
to
be
studied
is
the
infant
mind
itself
considered
as
a
great
and
wonderful
work
of
the
creator
with
a
sincere
desire
to
know
all
its
faculties
and
powers
and
the
various
simple
laws
by
which
its
operations
are
governed
the
teacher
ought
also
to
turn
his
thoughts
within
himself
to
study
his
own
mind
especially
in
his
recollections
of
very
early
childhood
and
the
modes
by
which
knowledge
is
gradually
acquired
these
things
carefully
and
dilligently
done
will
give
more
information
on
the
proper
method
of
educating
and
developing
the
young
mind
than
the
perusal
of
a
hundred
volumes
this
i
have
endeavoured
all
my
life
to
do
and
have
had
to
deal
with
many
thousands
of
children
who
have
been
to
me
a
book
for
constant
study
from
this
extensive
observation
and
experience
all
my
plans
have
been
formed
and
my
opinions
derived
if
any
one
has
done
the
same
or
more
to
him
i
will
gladly
concede
but
i
am
not
aware
that
any
one
individual
not
even
pestalozzi
has
run
a
similar
career

is
having
had
considerable
practice
in
teaching
children
in
the
various
parts
of
england
scotland
ireland
and
wales
it
may
be
necessary
to
give
a
few
hints
on
the
subject
of
organizing
an
infant
school
i
have
generally
found
on
opening
one
that
the
children
had
no
idea
of
acting
together
in
order
therefore
to
gain
this
object
it
will
be
found
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
what
we
call
which
consist
in
the
children
holding
up
their
hands
all
at
one
time
and
putting
them
down
in
the
same
manner
throwing
the
right
or
the
left
foot
out
putting
their
hands
together
or
behind
them
or
rising
from
their
seats
all
at
one
time
clapping
hands
which
is
a
very
good
exercise
holding
up
their
hands
and
twirling
the
fingers
holding
up
the
forefinger
and
bringing
it
down
on
the
palm
in
time
to
some
tune
imitating
the
action
of
sawing
wood
and
the
sound
produced
by
the
action
of
the
saw
doing
this
both
ways
as
it
is
done
in
the
with
both
hands
and
by
the
carpenter
with
the
right
imitating
the
cobbler
mending
shoes
the
carpenter
plaining
wood
the
tailor
sewing
and
any
other
trade
which
is
familiar
and
pleasing
to
children
this
we
do
in
the
first
instance
because
it
is
calculated
to
please
the
infants
and
is
one
grand
step
towards
order
after
the
first
day
or
two
the
children
will
begin
to
act
together
and
to
know
each
other
but
until
this
is
the
case
they
will
be
frequently
peevish
and
want
to
go
home
any
method
therefore
that
can
be
taken
at
first
to
gratify
them
should
be
adopted
for
unless
this
can
be
done
you
may
be
sure
they
will
cry
having
proceeded
thus
far
we
have
then
to
class
them
according
to
their
capacity
and
age
and
according
as
they
shew
an
aptitude
in
obeying
your
several
commands
those
who
obey
them
with
the
greatest
readiness
may
be
classed
together
i
have
found
it
difficult
at
all
times
to
keep
up
the
attention
of
infants
without
giving
them
something
to
do
so
that
when
they
are
saying
the
tables
in
arithmetic
we
always
cause
them
to
move
either
their
hands
or
feet
and
sometimes
to
march
round
the
school
the
best
way
we
have
yet
discovered
is
the
putting
their
hands
one
on
the
other
every
time
they
speak
a
sentence
if
they
are
marching
they
may
count
one
two
three
four
five
six
having
classed
them
and
found
that
each
child
knows
its
own
place
in
the
school
you
may
select
one
of
the
cleverest
of
each
class
for
a
monitor
some
of
the
children
will
learn
many
of
the
tables
sooner
than
the
others
in
this
case
the
teacher
may
avail
himself
of
their
assistance
by
causing
each
child
to
repeat
what
he
knows
in
an
audible
manner
the
other
children
repeating
after
him
and
performing
the
same
evolutions
that
he
does
and
by
this
means
the
rest
will
soon
learn
then
the
master
may
go
on
with
something
else
taking
care
to
obtain
as
much
assistance
from
the
children
as
he
can
for
he
will
find
that
unless
he
does
so
he
will
injure
his
lungs
and
render
himself
unfit
to
keep
up
their
attention
and
to
carry
on
the
business
of
the
school
when
the
children
have
learned
to
repeat
several
of
the
tables
and
the
monitors
to
excite
their
several
classes
and
keep
them
in
tolerable
order
they
may
go
on
with
the
other
parts
of
the
plan
such
as
the
spelling
and
reading
picture
lessons
which
will
presently
be
described
but
care
must
be
taken
that
in
the
beginning
too
much
be
not
attempted
the
first
week
may
be
spent
in
getting
them
in
order
without
thinking
of
anything
else
and
i
should
advise
that
not
more
than
sixty
children
be
then
admitted
that
they
may
be
reduced
to
order
in
some
measure
before
any
more
are
received
as
all
that
come
after
will
quickly
imitate
them
i
should
moreover
advise
visitors
not
to
come
for
some
time
after
a
school
is
opened
for
several
reasons
first
because
the
children
must
be
allowed
time
to
learn
and
there
will
be
nothing
worth
seeing
secondly
they
take
off
the
children
attention
and
interfere
with
the
master
and
lastly
they
may
go
away
dissatisfied
and
thereby
injure
the
cause
which
they
intend
to
promote
in
teaching
infants
to
sing
i
have
found
it
the
best
way
to
sing
the
psalm
or
hymn
several
times
in
the
hearing
of
the
children
without
their
attempting
to
do
so
until
they
have
some
idea
of
the
tune
because
if
all
the
children
are
allowed
to
attempt
and
none
of
them
know
it
it
prevents
those
who
really
wish
to
learn
from
catching
the
sounds
nothing
however
can
be
more
ridiculous
or
absurd
than
the
attempts
at
singing
i
have
heard
in
some
schools
and
here
i
would
caution
teachers
against
too
much
singing
and
also
against
introducing
it
at
improper
times
singing
takes
much
of
the
teacher
which
will
soon
be
felt
in
the
chest
and
cause
pain
and
weakness
there
and
if
persevered
in
premature
and
with
women
much
sooner
than
men
this
is
another
reason
why
one
of
each
sex
should
be
employed
in
the
work
singing
is
an
exhilarating
and
exciting
lesson
the
children
always
like
it
but
even
they
are
injured
by
the
injudicious
management
of
it
and
by
having
too
much
of
it
each
day
or
the
having
two
or
even
three
exciting
lessons
at
the
same
time
for
example
i
have
seen
children
singing
marching
and
clapping
hands
at
the
same
time
and
they
are
prompted
and
led
by
the
teachers
to
do
so
here
are
three
exciting
lessons
together
which
ought
to
be
separate
the
result
is
a
waste
of
energy
and
strength
on
the
part
of
teacher
and
children
which
is
sometimes
fatal
to
both
the
exciting
lessons
were
intended
to
be
judiciously
blended
with
the
drier
yet
necessary
studies
if
the
latter
are
neglected
and
the
former
only
retained
no
greater
perversion
of
the
plans
could
occur
and
a
more
fatal
error
could
not
be
committed
you
must
not
expect
order
until
your
little
officers
are
well
drilled
which
may
be
done
by
collecting
them
together
after
the
other
children
are
gone
and
instructing
them
in
what
they
are
to
do
every
monitor
should
know
his
work
and
when
you
have
taught
him
this
you
must
require
it
to
be
done
to
get
good
order
you
must
make
every
monitor
answerable
for
the
conduct
of
his
class
it
is
astonishing
how
some
of
the
little
fellows
will
strut
about
big
with
the
importance
of
office
and
here
i
must
remark
it
will
require
some
caution
to
prevent
them
from
taking
too
much
upon
themselves
so
prone
are
we
even
in
our
earliest
years
to
abuse
the
possession
of
power
the
way
by
which
we
teach
the
children
hymns
is
to
let
one
child
stand
in
a
place
where
he
may
be
seen
by
the
rest
with
the
book
in
his
hand
he
then
reads
one
line
and
stops
until
all
the
children
in
the
school
have
repeated
it
which
they
do
simultaneously
he
then
repeats
another
and
so
on
successively
until
the
hymn
is
finished
this
method
is
adopted
with
every
thing
that
is
to
be
committed
to
memory
so
that
every
child
in
the
school
has
an
equal
chance
of
learning
i
have
mentioned
that
the
children
should
be
classed
in
order
to
facilitate
this
there
should
be
a
board
fastened
to
the
wall
perpendicularly
the
same
width
as
the
seats
every
fifteen
feet
all
round
the
school
this
will
separate
one
class
from
another
and
be
the
cause
of
the
children
knowing
their
class
the
sooner
make
every
child
hang
his
hat
over
where
he
sits
in
his
own
class
as
this
will
save
much
trouble
have
a
place
for
every
thing
and
every
thing
in
its
place
this
will
bring
the
children
into
habits
of
order
never
do
any
thing
for
a
child
that
he
is
able
to
do
for
himself
but
teach
him
to
put
his
own
hat
and
coat
on
and
hang
them
up
again
when
he
comes
to
school
teach
every
child
to
help
himself
as
soon
as
possible
if
one
falls
down
and
you
know
that
he
is
able
to
get
up
himself
never
lift
him
up
if
you
do
he
will
always
lie
till
you
can
give
him
your
aid
have
a
slate
or
a
piece
of
paper
properly
ruled
hanging
over
every
class
let
every
child
name
that
is
in
the
class
be
written
on
it
with
the
name
of
the
monitor
teach
the
monitor
the
names
as
soon
as
you
can
and
then
he
will
tell
you
who
is
absent
have
a
semicircle
before
every
lesson
and
make
the
children
keep
their
toes
to
the
mark
brass
nails
driven
in
the
floor
are
the
best
or
flat
brass
or
iron
let
into
the
floor
when
a
monitor
is
asking
the
children
questions
let
him
place
his
stool
in
the
centre
of
the
semicircle
and
the
children
stand
around
him
let
the
monitors
ask
what
questions
they
please
they
will
soon
get
fond
of
the
process
and
their
pupils
will
soon
be
equally
fond
of
answering
them
suppose
the
monitor
ask
what
do
i
sit
on
where
are
your
toes
what
do
you
stand
on
what
is
before
you
what
behind
you
let
the
monitors
be
instructed
in
giving
simple
object
lessons
on
any
familiar
substance
such
as
a
piece
of
wood
of
stone
of
iron
of
paper
of
bone
of
linen
let
them
question
their
class
as
to
the
qualities
first
and
then
the
various
uses
to
which
the
object
is
applied
these
lessons
will
be
of
incalculable
benefit
to
the
children
and
give
them
an
early
desire
to
inquire
into
the
nature
qualities
and
uses
of
every
natural
object
they
come
into
contact
with
we
will
suppose
the
monitor
holds
in
his
hand
a
piece
of
leather
he
first
asks
what
is
this
the
children
will
simultaneously
exclaim
a
piece
of
leather
this
being
answered
he
will
proceed
to
the
qualities
and
will
have
either
from
his
class
or
by
his
own
help
the
following
answers
it
is
dry
it
is
smooth
it
is
hard
it
is
tough
it
is
pliable
it
is
opaque
he
will
then
question
them
as
to
its
uses
and
will
ask
what
is
made
from
leather
a
boots
and
shoes
q
what
use
is
it
of
else
a
books
are
bound
with
it
and
so
on
through
all
its
uses
he
will
then
ask
them
how
leather
is
made
and
give
them
information
which
he
has
himself
previously
received
from
the
teacher
as
to
the
mode
of
tanning
leather
and
the
various
processes
which
it
goes
through
indeed
there
is
no
end
to
the
varied
information
which
children
may
thus
receive
from
simple
natural
objects
at
first
they
will
have
no
idea
of
this
mode
of
exercising
the
thinking
powers
but
the
teacher
must
encourage
them
in
it
and
they
will
very
speedily
get
fond
of
it
and
be
able
to
give
an
answer
immediately
it
is
very
pleasing
to
witness
this
i
have
been
much
delighted
at
the
questions
put
and
still
more
so
at
the
answers
given
assemble
all
the
very
small
children
together
as
soon
as
you
can
the
first
day
or
two
they
will
want
to
sit
with
their
brothers
or
sisters
who
are
a
little
older
than
themselves
but
the
sooner
you
can
separate
them
the
better
as
the
elder
children
frequently
plague
the
younger
ones
and
i
have
always
found
that
the
youngest
ones
are
the
happiest
by
themselves
in
all
cases
let
teachers
be
careful
to
avoid
the
parrot
system
and
to
remember
that
while
it
is
necessary
to
infuse
a
certain
amount
of
information
into
the
child
mind
it
can
only
be
made
its
own
by
drawing
it
back
again
and
getting
its
own
ideas
upon
it
this
is
called
development
which
is
a
thing
universally
disregarded
in
almost
every
school
i
have
seen
and
it
is
a
general
complaint
made
by
almost
every
modern
writer
on
education
and
many
have
objected
to
the
infant
system
on
this
account
because
the
teachers
of
it
were
not
acquainted
with
its
end
and
essence
the
true
infant
system
is
a
system
of
development
no
other
system
can
be
of
lasting
benefit
to
the
country
in
general
nor
to
the
pupils
in
particular
the
genuine
infant
system
is
not
subject
to
the
fundamental
errors
so
much
complained
of
it
has
been
invented
for
the
purpose
of
operating
upon
all
the
faculties
and
the
machine
must
not
be
condemned
merely
because
the
teachers
do
not
know
how
to
work
it
but
every
committee
and
each
individual
in
a
committee
appear
to
lose
sight
of
these
principles
in
order
to
try
how
much
originality
may
be
displayed
and
thus
utility
is
sacrificed
to
novelty
thus
we
may
find
as
many
infant
systems
as
there
are
days
in
the
year
and
i
have
been
made
chargeable
by
certain
writers
for
the
errors
of
others
but
these
writers
have
not
condescended
to
examine
into
the
merits
of
the
system
for
which
i
have
been
so
many
years
an
advocate
but
enough
of
this
we
will
now
suppose
that
the
little
flock
are
brought
by
thus
time
into
something
like
order
we
are
next
to
consider
the
means
of
securing
other
objects
although
the
following
rules
for
this
purpose
are
given
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
they
are
presented
as
a
model
not
to
be
departed
from
if
they
can
be
improved
so
much
the
better
but
some
such
will
be
found
indispensable
rules
be
observed
by
the
parents
of
children
admitted
into
the
infant
parents
are
to
send
their
children
clean
washed
with
their
hair
cut
short
and
combed
and
their
clothes
well
mended
by
eight
in
the
morning
to
remain
till
twelve
if
any
child
be
later
in
attendance
than
nine
in
the
morning
that
child
must
be
sent
back
until
the
afternoon
and
in
case
of
being
later
than
two
in
the
afternoon
it
will
be
sent
back
for
the
day
parents
may
send
their
children
dinners
with
them
in
the
morning
so
that
the
children
may
be
taken
care
of
the
whole
day
to
enable
the
mother
to
go
out
to
work
this
can
only
be
done
where
the
teachers
reside
on
the
premises
if
a
child
be
absent
for
a
length
of
time
without
a
notice
being
sent
to
the
master
or
mistress
assigning
a
satisfactory
reason
for
the
absence
such
child
will
not
be
permitted
to
return
again
to
the
school
saturday
is
a
holyday
a
footnote
a
in
ireland
the
schools
do
not
commence
business
till
ten
in
the
morning
and
the
children
remain
till
three
and
do
not
go
home
in
the
interval
in
scotland
the
rules
are
nearly
similar
it
is
earnestly
hoped
that
parents
will
see
their
own
interest
as
well
as
that
of
their
children
in
strictly
observing
these
rules
and
they
are
exhorted
to
submit
to
their
children
being
governed
by
the
master
and
mistress
to
give
them
good
instruction
and
advice
to
accustom
them
to
family
prayer
but
particularly
to
see
that
they
repeat
the
lord
prayer
when
they
rise
in
the
morning
and
when
they
retire
to
rest
and
assist
in
their
learning
the
commandments
and
to
set
before
them
a
good
example
for
in
so
doing
they
may
humbly
hope
that
the
blessing
of
almighty
god
will
rest
upon
them
and
their
families
for
we
are
assured
in
the
holy
scriptures
that
if
we
train
up
a
child
in
the
way
he
should
go
when
he
is
old
he
will
not
depart
from
it
prov
xxii
therefore
parents
may
be
instrumental
in
the
promotion
of
the
welfare
of
their
children
in
this
life
and
of
their
eternal
happiness
in
the
world
to
come
on
each
of
these
rules
i
will
make
a
few
remarks
some
parents
are
so
habitually
dirty
that
they
would
not
wash
their
children
from
one
week
end
to
another
unless
required
so
to
do
and
if
it
be
done
for
them
they
will
not
be
so
thankful
as
when
compelled
to
do
it
themselves
this
i
have
found
from
experience
this
has
its
advantages
for
it
would
not
be
right
to
punish
the
children
when
the
fault
rests
with
their
parents
consequently
by
sending
them
home
the
real
authors
of
the
evil
are
punished
many
parents
have
told
me
that
when
their
children
were
at
home
they
employed
themselves
in
singing
the
alphabet
counting
patting
their
hands
that
it
was
impossible
to
keep
an
infant
asleep
that
they
were
glad
to
get
them
out
of
the
way
and
that
they
would
take
care
that
they
should
not
be
late
again
but
there
is
no
rule
without
an
exception
i
have
found
that
this
has
its
disadvantages
for
some
of
the
elder
children
when
they
wanted
a
would
take
care
to
be
late
in
order
to
find
the
door
shut
although
they
were
sent
in
proper
time
by
their
parents
this
when
detected
subjects
them
to
a
pat
on
the
hand
which
is
the
only
corporeal
punishment
we
have
if
this
rule
were
not
strictly
enforced
the
children
would
be
coming
at
all
hours
of
the
day
which
would
put
the
school
into
such
disorder
that
we
should
never
know
when
all
the
children
had
said
their
lessons
this
is
of
great
service
to
those
parents
who
go
out
to
work
for
by
sending
their
children
dinners
with
them
they
are
enabled
to
attend
to
their
employment
in
comfort
and
the
children
when
properly
disciplined
will
be
no
additional
trouble
to
the
teacher
for
they
will
play
about
the
while
he
takes
his
dinner
without
doing
any
mischief
many
persons
will
keep
their
children
away
for
a
month
or
two
when
nothing
is
the
matter
with
them
consequently
the
children
will
lose
almost
all
they
have
learned
at
school
besides
this
children
are
kept
out
who
perhaps
would
attend
regularly
and
we
should
never
know
how
many
children
were
in
the
establishment
if
therefore
a
parent
does
not
attend
to
this
rule
the
child
name
is
struck
off
the
book
on
the
admission
of
every
child
the
parents
should
be
supplied
with
a
copy
of
the
preceding
rules
as
this
will
prevent
them
from
pleading
any
excuse
it
should
be
fastened
on
pasteboard
otherwise
they
will
double
it
up
and
put
it
into
their
pockets
and
forget
all
about
it
but
being
on
pasteboard
they
may
hang
it
up
in
their
dwellings
the
short
exhortation
that
follows
it
is
hoped
may
have
its
use
by
reminding
the
parents
of
their
duty
to
with
those
persons
who
have
the
welfare
both
of
themselves
and
their
children
at
heart
the
reasons
for
the
holiday
of
saturday
are
first
that
the
teacher
requires
a
rest
the
infant
system
being
so
laborious
second
that
the
requires
to
be
thoroughly
cleaned
and
thirdly
that
many
of
the
mothers
are
obliged
to
wash
the
children
clothes
on
a
saturday
because
they
have
not
a
sufficient
change
and
if
they
do
not
have
the
saturday
they
will
break
the
sabbath
by
washing
them
on
sunday
i
shall
next
speak
of
the
of
instruction
if
we
would
be
successful
in
our
labours
we
most
ask
for
help
we
must
solicit
aid
from
that
being
who
never
yet
denied
it
when
sincerely
and
fervently
implored
a
minister
who
desires
to
instruct
his
flock
with
effect
never
fails
to
commence
his
work
with
supplication
and
certainly
every
teacher
must
ask
for
help
and
instruct
his
pupils
to
do
so
too
if
he
really
wish
to
be
successful
if
the
wisest
and
best
of
men
ask
assistance
from
god
to
teach
their
and
feel
and
know
it
to
be
necessary
so
to
do
who
would
not
ask
assistance
to
instruct
infants
to
lead
them
into
virtue
path
and
up
to
truth
divine
if
we
had
only
to
educate
the
prayer
might
be
less
necessary
but
the
promoters
of
want
to
affect
the
to
operate
upon
the
will
and
the
conscience
as
well
as
on
the
understanding
to
make
good
men
rather
than
learned
men
men
of
rather
than
men
of
and
he
who
has
this
work
to
accomplish
should
remember
the
saviour
declaration
without
me
ye
can
do
nothing
whilst
therefore
i
would
avoid
too
frequent
repetition
of
the
divine
names
in
tire
presence
of
the
children
and
never
fail
to
let
them
know
the
difference
between
talking
religion
and
doing
religion
and
in
every
case
avoid
the
very
appearance
of
the
form
without
the
essence
i
would
in
such
case
avoid
long
prayers
and
take
care
that
what
was
said
in
their
presence
should
be
short
and
to
the
point
keeping
in
mind
the
scripture
maxim
to
avoid
long
repetitions
as
the
heathen
do
who
think
they
shall
be
heard
for
their
much
speaking
and
little
children
can
not
have
the
simple
truths
of
the
word
pourtrayed
to
them
in
too
simple
a
manner
to
use
prayers
with
little
children
composed
of
hard
words
taken
from
scholastic
theology
is
contrary
to
common
sense
how
is
it
possible
that
they
can
either
understand
or
feel
them
to
utter
prayer
before
them
in
dull
and
melancholy
tones
and
with
grimaces
of
countenance
is
calculated
to
give
a
false
and
gloomy
impression
of
religion
and
has
often
done
so
i
have
known
little
children
alarmed
and
frightened
at
such
things
for
sounds
and
appearances
speak
more
strongly
to
them
than
christ
said
of
the
pharisees
they
disfigure
their
faces
our
saviour
direction
is
after
this
manner
pray
ye
our
father
thus
directing
us
to
draw
near
to
the
most
high
god
as
a
heavenly
father
rich
in
mercy
to
all
them
that
call
upon
him
true
indeed
it
is
that
all
have
sinned
but
a
new
and
living
way
is
provided
whereby
we
may
draw
near
with
boldness
to
a
throne
of
grace
to
obtain
mercy
and
find
grace
to
help
in
time
of
need
cowper
never
penned
a
truer
line
than
this
true
piety
is
cheerful
as
the
day
and
such
an
impression
of
it
should
ever
be
given
to
the
young
the
best
prayer
of
a
master
for
his
children
is
the
perpetual
and
strong
desire
of
his
heart
for
god
blessing
upon
them
which
when
genuine
and
sincere
will
without
doubt
be
recorded
on
high
and
will
also
urge
him
on
to
a
faithful
and
unceasing
discharge
of
his
duties
towards
them
to
possess
this
is
indeed
to
pray
without
ceasing
and
will
prevent
an
unnecessary
multiplication
of
long
prayers
vain
repetitions
and
much
speaking
but
to
proceed
the
children
being
assembled
should
be
desired
to
stand
up
and
immediately
afterwards
to
kneel
down
all
close
to
their
seats
and
as
silently
as
possible
those
who
are
not
strong
enough
to
kneel
may
be
allowed
to
sit
down
this
being
done
a
child
is
to
be
placed
in
the
centre
of
the
school
and
to
repeat
the
following
prayer
o
god
our
heavenly
father
thou
art
good
to
us
we
would
serve
thee
we
have
sinned
and
done
wrong
many
times
jesus
christ
died
on
the
cross
for
us
forgive
our
sins
for
jesus
sake
may
the
holy
spirit
change
our
hearts
and
make
us
to
love
god
help
us
to
be
good
children
and
to
do
what
is
right
keep
us
from
wicked
thoughts
and
bad
tempers
make
us
try
to
learn
all
that
we
are
taught
keep
us
in
health
all
the
day
we
would
always
think
of
god
and
when
we
die
may
we
go
to
heaven
god
bless
our
fathers
and
mothers
and
sisters
and
brothers
and
our
teachers
and
make
us
obedient
and
kind
for
jesus
christ
sake
amen
perhaps
it
would
be
better
under
all
the
circumstances
to
use
a
simple
prayer
out
of
the
book
of
common
prayer
the
children
afterwards
repeat
the
lord
prayer
and
then
sing
a
hymn
for
instance
the
following
when
first
the
morning
light
we
see
and
from
our
beds
arise
we
to
our
god
should
thankful
be
who
every
want
supplies
was
god
who
made
the
brilliant
sun
that
gives
all
day
its
light
and
it
was
god
who
made
the
moon
and
stars
which
shine
at
night
the
fish
that
in
the
water
swim
the
beasts
upon
the
land
were
all
created
first
by
him
and
shew
his
mighty
hand
the
food
we
eat
the
clothes
we
wear
is
god
alone
can
give
and
only
by
his
love
and
care
can
little
children
live
then
let
us
ever
caution
take
his
holy
laws
to
keep
and
praise
him
from
the
time
we
wake
until
again
we
sleep
immediately
after
this
they
proceed
to
their
lessons
which
are
fixed
to
what
are
called
to
each
of
these
posts
there
is
a
monitor
who
is
provided
with
a
piece
of
cane
for
a
pointer
this
post
is
placed
opposite
to
his
class
and
every
class
has
one
up
to
which
the
monitor
brings
the
children
three
or
four
at
a
time
according
to
the
number
he
has
in
his
class
we
have
fourteen
classes
and
sometimes
more
which
are
regularly
numbered
so
that
we
have
one
hundred
children
moving
and
saying
their
lessons
at
one
time
when
these
are
gone
through
the
children
are
supplied
with
pictures
which
they
put
on
the
post
the
same
as
the
spelling
and
reading
lessons
but
say
them
in
a
different
manner
we
find
that
if
a
class
always
goes
through
its
lessons
at
one
post
it
soon
loses
its
attraction
and
consequently
although
we
can
not
change
them
from
post
to
post
in
the
spelling
and
reading
lessons
because
it
would
be
useless
to
put
a
child
to
a
reading
post
that
did
not
know
its
letters
yet
we
can
do
so
in
the
picture
lessons
as
the
children
are
all
alike
in
learning
the
objects
one
child
can
learn
an
object
as
quick
as
another
so
that
we
may
have
many
children
that
can
tell
the
name
of
different
subjects
and
even
the
names
of
all
the
geometrical
figures
who
do
not
know
all
the
letters
in
the
alphabet
and
i
have
had
children
whom
one
might
think
were
complete
blockheads
on
account
of
their
not
being
able
to
learn
the
alphabet
so
quickly
as
some
of
the
other
children
and
yet
those
very
children
would
learn
things
which
appeared
to
me
ten
times
more
difficult
this
proves
the
necessity
of
variety
and
how
difficult
it
is
to
legislate
for
children
instead
therefore
of
the
children
standing
opposite
their
own
post
they
go
round
from
one
to
another
repeating
whatever
they
find
at
each
post
until
they
have
been
all
round
the
school
for
instance
at
no
post
there
may
be
the
following
objects
the
horse
the
ass
the
zebra
the
cow
the
sheep
the
goat
the
springing
antelope
the
cameleopard
the
camel
the
wild
boar
the
rhinoceros
the
elephant
the
hippopotamus
the
lion
the
tiger
the
leopard
the
civet
the
weazel
the
great
white
bear
the
hyena
the
fox
the
greenland
dog
the
hare
the
mole
the
squirrel
the
kangaroo
the
porcupine
and
the
racoon
before
commencing
these
lessons
two
boys
are
selected
by
the
master
who
perhaps
are
not
monitors
these
two
boys
bring
the
children
up
to
a
chalk
line
that
is
made
near
no
post
eight
at
a
time
one
of
the
boys
gets
eight
children
standing
up
ready
always
beginning
at
one
end
of
the
school
and
takes
them
to
this
chalk
line
whilst
the
other
boy
takes
them
to
no
post
and
delivers
them
up
to
the
charge
of
no
monitor
no
monitor
then
points
to
the
different
animals
with
a
pointer
until
the
name
of
every
one
that
is
on
his
plate
has
been
repeated
this
done
he
delivers
them
to
no
monitor
who
has
a
different
picture
at
his
post
perhaps
the
following
the
fishmonger
mason
hatter
cooper
butcher
blacksmith
fruiterer
distiller
grocer
turner
carpenter
milliner
dyer
druggist
wheelwright

this
done
no

delivers
them
over

who
may
have
a

having
repeated
these
no

hands
them
over
to
no
who
perhaps
has
an
engraved
clock
face
with
hands
composed
of
two
pieces
of
wood
over
which
paper
in
the
shape
of
clock
hands
has
been
pasted
he
gives
the
children
a
lesson
from
this
object
explains
to
them
the
difference
between
the
minute
and
shews
them
their
uses
and
points
out
the
dots
which
mark
the
minutes
and
the
figures
which
divide
it
into
hours
makes
them
count
the
seconds
and
soon
tell
the
hour
no
then
gives
the
class
to
no
monitor
who
has
at
his
post
a
representation
of
the
mariner
compass
he
explains
its
uses
shews
them
the
cardinal
points
tells
them
how
it
was
discovered
and
then
he
will
move
the
hands
around
beginning
at
the
north
and
making
the
children
repeat
as
he
moves
the
hands
north
east
south
west
west
north
the
degrees
may
be
considered
as
going
too
far
for
infants
we
therefore
reserve
them
until
we
treat
of
juvenile
schools
we
have
not
thought
it
necessary
to
name
all
the
points
of
the
compass
but
have
confined
ourselves
to
the
principal
ones
no
then
hands
the
class

the

and
as

is
the
life
and
soul
of
the
plan
his

may
be

a
set
of
geometrical
figures
illustrated
by
the
representation
of
objects
either
natural

of

a

a

a

an

a

a

an

dutch
tartars
to
enter
into
a
thorough
explanation
of
the
uses
to
which
such
lessons
as
these
may
be
applied
would
make
a
volume
of
itself
which
at
present
i
have
no
time
to
write
a
but
it
may
be
necessary
for
the
sake
of
teachers
generally
to
shew
the
uses
to
which
a
few
of
them
may
be
applied
and
leave
it
to
their
own
ingenuity
to
go
on
is
a
similar
manner
with
the
great
variety
of
lessons
we
have
of
this
description
and
which
infants
are
quite
competent
to
learn
take
the
european
costumes
as
an
example
when
the
children
are
thoroughly
acquainted
with
each
of
the
representations
and
can
name
them
themselves
or
if
too
young
to
name
them
can
point
them
out
if
they
are
named
by
the
teacher
they
may
then
be
told
that
the
englishman
is
born
in
a
country
called
england
and
that
london
is
the
capital
and
that
capital
means
the
greatest
town
or
city
care
must
be
taken
that
every
thing
is
thoroughly
explained
and
that
the
pupils
understand
the
meaning
of
the
terms
used
you
then
windup
this
much
by
telling
the
pupils
that
englishman
means
the
man
england
the
country
and
london
the
chief
city
that
england
is
the

separated
from
england

may
here
mention
some
remarkable

and
tell
the
children
that
france
and
england
have
been
often
fighting
against

that

are
now
at
peace
and
that
we
should
be
as
kind
and
good
to
frenchmen
as
to
any
other
men
because
god
likes
to
see
all
men
live
friendly
with
each
other

told
that

a
man

and
that
the
people
of
russia
drive
over
the

and
snow
in
sledges
which
are
carriages
without
wheels
that
swiss
means
an
inhabitant
of
a
country
named
switzerland
which
is
almost
in
the
centre
of
europe
and
has
no
sea
near
it
that
it
is
a
very
pretty
country
full
of
beautiful
lakes
and
mountains
that
a
lake

a
very
great

that
mountains
are
very
high
rocky
places
and
that
the
tops
of
the
mountains

switzerland
are
always
covered
with
snow
that
the
swiss
people
are
very
brave
and
fought
very
hard
for
their
freedom

is
that
no
other

should
be
masters
over

volume

juvenile
schools

out

be
had
of
the
publisher

in
this
manner

in

manner
the
children
may
receive
instruction
fitted
for
their
tender
understanding
concerning
the
other
parts
of
the
globe
always
keeping
in
mind
that
unless
they
are
made
to
comprehend
thoroughly
what
is
given
to
them
it
is
quite
useless
to
attempt
to
give
them
the
lessons
at
all
when
giving
the
lessons
on
african
costumes
the
teacher
should
explain
in
the
simplest
manner
that
the
egyptian
bey
is
the
chief
governor
of
a
country
in
africa
called
egypt
that
africa
is
one
of
the
four
great
parts
into
which
our
earth
is
divided
that
the
nile
is
a
great
river
flowing
through
egypt
which
at
certain
times
of
the
year
overflows
its
banks
and
that
this
fertilizes
the
ground
and
causes
the
corn
to
grow
which
but
for
this
would
be
withered
with
the
sun
because
but
very
little
rain
ever
falls
in
egypt
that
the
cause
of
the
nile
overflowing
its
banks
is
the
great
rains
which
fall
in
the
countries
from
whence
the
nile
flows
that
the
ashantee
is
an
inhabitant
of
another
country
of
africa
where
the
people
are
very
ignorant
and
do
not
know
as
much
as
the
little
children
of
an
infant
school
that
the
algerine
lives
in
a
part
of
africa
called
algiers
the
people
there
are
very
wicked
and
cruel
and
used
at
one
time
to
take
the
ships
of
every
other
country
that
they
met
on
the
seas
and
make
slaves
of
the
people
they
found
in
them
but
they
can
not
do
so
now
because
the
french
have
conquered
them
and
taken
all
their
ships
from
them
that
the
bedouin
arabs
are
people
who
rove
about
from
place
to
place
amongst
the
great
sandy
deserts
of
africa
and
rob
travellers
who
are
passing
over
those
deserts
the
teacher
should
explain
that
these
deserts
are
very
large
places
covered
with
sand
and
the
sun
is
so
hot
that
no
tree
or
shrub
or
grass
will
grow
there
and
there
is
no
water
to
be
had
so
that
travellers
carry
water
in
leathern
bottles
on
the
backs
of
camels
that
camels
are
large
animals
much
larger
than
a
horse
which
are
very
useful
in
those
warm
countries
because
they
can
carry
very
heavy
loads
on
their
backs
and
go
a
great
time
without
water
the
copts
woman
should
be
pointed
out
to
the
children
and
notice
should
be
taken
of
the
large
veil
before
her
face
the
mameluke
should
be
pointed
out
as
belonging
to
a
fierce
tribe
of
soldiers
when
speaking
of
the
natives
of
morocco
it
should
be
mentioned
that
the
moors
at
one
time
had
possession
of
spain
that
the
maltese
is
a
native
of
an
island
called
malta
that
cairo
a
picture
of
a
native
of
which
is
in
the
lesson
is
the
chief
city
of
egypt
that
the
bosjesman
native
of
coronna
native
of
namacqua
caffree
native
of
tamaka
and
of
ebo
belong
to
the
savage
nations
of
africa
of
which
but
little
is
known
who
are
of
a
black
colour
and
go
with
very
little
clothes
on
them
because
the
country
is
so
warm
from
the
lesson
supposed
to
be
at
no
a
good
deal
of
information
may
be
given
the
teacher
may
be
thus
supposed
to
address
the
children
pointing
to
each
picture
as
he
describes
it
little
children
this
is
a
picture
of
negroes

a
very
hot
part
of
the
world
and
the
poor
negroes
are
black
and
have
short
black
woolly
hair
something
like
the
hair
on
a
black
sheep
but
we
must
not
laugh
at
them
for
this
it
was
god
who
made
them
as
well
as
he
made
you
and
those
poor
negroes

very
mild
and
quiet
people

to
amuse
themselves
by
singing
and
dancing

better

it
gives
them
food
for
themselves
and
their
horses
of
which
they
have
a
great
many
horses
are
wild
in
tartary
the
reader
will
at
once
perceive
what
a
feast
is
afforded
to
the
young
mind
in
these
object
lessons
the
objects
are
accurately
copied
from
nature
and
the
costumes
from
the
best
sources
so
that
the
infant
mind
is
expanded
by
viewing
a
proper
representation
of
the
real
thing
through
the
fit
organ
the
eye
it
is
astonishing
what
infants
will
learn
through
the
sense
of
seeing
and
it
is
remarkable
that
our
systems
of
education
for
young
and
old
should
not
have
been
founded
on
a
knowledge
of
the
high
importance
of
this
medium
for
communication
and
information
the
youngest
child
may
learn
to
distinguish
one
object
from
another
to
an
endless
variety
and
i
could
produce
children
who
could
point
me
out
a
thousand
objects
if
i
called
them
by
their
proper
names
who
perhaps
could
not
themselves
name
twenty
of
the
objects
out
of
the
thousand
by
this
it
will
be
seen
we
first
give
them
the
object
and
language
itself
follows
in
due
course
whenever
a
clear
idea
or
notion
is
given
to
the
mind
by
a
picture
or
object
it
is
then
easy
to
impart
the
information
that
is
naturally
connected
with
it
and
this
will
then
be
most
strongly
retained
according
to
the
law
of
association
which
is
one
of
the
most
important
principles
to
be
kept
in
view
in
imparting
instruction
to
both
young
and
old
lead
on
from
to
is
a
golden
rule
a
most
valuable
axiom
that
all
teachers
should
ever
bear
constantly
in
mind
what
important
lessons
may
be
given
in
a
field
wood
or
forest
how
much
better
is
the
thing
itself
for
a
lesson
than
the
representation
of
it
and
what
a
class
of
teachers
are
wanted
for
this
work
yet
sure
i
am
that
in
due
time
the
great
god
will
raise
such
up
from
amongst
his
people
to
the
glory
of
his
name
and
the
benefit
of
succeeding
generations
may
greater
minds
than
the
humble
writer
of
this
be
called
to
work
in
this
blessed
vineyard
for
the
good
of
the
species
and
for
the
diminution
of
crime
and
oh
may
they
be
able
to
dive
into
the
recesses
of
the
wonderful
works
of
god
to
grapple
with
the
difficulties
therein
found
and
bring
to
light
some
of
the
hidden
mysteries
for
the
instruction
of
mankind
when
this
book
was
first
written
years
ago
some
of
the
ideas
were
universally
scouted
yet
i
have
lived
to
see
the
day
that
the
very
men
who
sneered
at
the
views
first
made
known
in
this
book
adopt
precisely
the
same
principles
and
even
go
much
further
that
i
ever
intended
or
even
thought
suitable
for
infant
minds
and
quietly
puff
this
off
as
a
new
discovery
in
infant
training
so
much
the
better
portions
of
the
public
will
hear
them
and
they
would
not
listen
to
me
and
if
the
end
is
answered
it
is
of
little
consequence
through
what
means
that
end
is
gained
it
is
satisfactory
to
know
that
the
principles
first
developed
in
the
infant
plan
are
found
equally
applicable
to
older
children
and
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
those
principles
carried
out
in
many
schools
throughout
the
country
too
numerous
to
mention
individually
it
will
be
seen
from
what
has
been
said
that
the
plan
of
the
children
marching
from
one
post
to
the
other
is
the
very
thing
for
infants
as
exercising
and
developing
their
locomotive
powers
a
thing
exceedingly
desirable
for
young
children
the
great
error
of
the
old
infant
system
or
in
other
words
the
plan
was
the
keeping
the
pupils
rivetted
to
their
seats
here
they
are
marching
from
one
place
to
another
and
get
ting
food
for
every
sense
take
as
another
example

picture
of
the
trades
the
monitor
says
to
his
little
pupils
as
they
come

neither
at

if
the
children
appear
particularly
disinclined
there
are
a
few
other
matters
on
which
before
concluding
this
chapter
i
must
speak
as
claiming
the
attention
of
infant
school
conductors
first
attend
to
cleanliness
although
we
have
referred
to
this
before
yet
as
it
is
of
considerable
importance
not
only
to
the
children
but
to
those
around
them
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
take
up
a
little
more
of
the
time
and
to
state
the
different
plans
that
have
been
devised
in
order
to
make
the
children
as
clean
as
possible
in
one
case
a
trough
was
erected
and
a
pipe
provided
to
convey
the
water
into
it
but
before
it
had
been
up
a
month
it
was
found
that
instead
of
answering
the
end
intended
it
had
quite
a
contrary
effect
for
the
children
dabbled
in
the
trough
and
made
themselves
ten
times
worse
than
they
were
by
wetting
themselves
from
head
to
foot
besides
which
it
frequently
caused
them
to
take
cold
of
which
the
parents
complained
some
took
their
children
away
without
notice
others
came
and
gave
the
master
what
they
called
good
set
it
was
therefore
thought
necessary
to
forbid
the
children
washing
themselves
and
to
wash
all
that
came
dirty
but
it
was
soon
found
that
the
dirty
children
increased
so
fast
that
it
required
one
person
time
to
attend
to
them
besides
which
it
had
another
bad
effect
it
encouraged
the
parents
in
laziness
and
they
told
me
when
i
complained
of
their
sending
the
children
to
school
dirty
that
indeed
they
had
no
time
to
wash
their
children
there
was
a
trough
in
the
school
for
that
purpose
and
the
persons
who
had
charge
of
the
school
were
paid
for
it
and
ought
to
do
it
in
consequence
of
this
the
trough
was
taken
away
and
it
was
represented
to
the
parents
that
it
was
their
duty
to
keep
their
children
clean
that
unless
they
did
so
they
would
be
sent
home
to
be
washed
and
if
they
persisted
in
sending
them
without
being
washed
there
would
be
no
alternative
left
but
to
dismiss
them
from
the
school
altogether
this
offended
some
of
the
parents
and
they
took
their
children
out
of
the
school
but
many
afterwards
petitioned
to
have
them
readmitted
i
mention
this
merely
to
prevent
others
who
may
be
concerned
in
the
establishment
of
infant
schools
from
incurring
an
unnecessary
expense
and
to
shew
that
the
parents
will
value
the
school
equally
as
well
if
you
make
them
wash
their
children
as
if
you
did
it
for
them
the
plan
that
we
have
acted
upon
to
enforce
cleanliness
is
as
follows
as
soon
as
the
children
are
assembled
in
the
school
the
monitors
cause
them
to
hold
out
their
hands
with
their
heads
up
they
then
inspect
their
hands
and
their
faces
and
all
those
who
are
dirty
are
desired
to
stand
out
to
be
examined
by
the
master
who
will
easily
perceive
whether
they
have
been
washed
that
morning
if
not
they
are
sent
home
to
be
washed
and
if
the
mother
has
any
sense
of
propriety
she
will
take
care
that
it
shall
not
often
occur
but
it
may
be
found
that
some
have
been
washed
and
been
playing
with
the
dirt
when
coming
to
school
which
some
children
are
very
apt
to
do
in
this
case
they
have
a
pat
on
the
hand
which
generally
cures
them
there
is
much
trouble
at
first
to
keep
the
children
quite
clean
some
of
their
parents
are
habitually
dirty
and
in
such
cases
the
children
will
be
like
them
these
will
therefore
require
more
trouble
than
others
but
they
will
soon
acquire
cleanly
habits
and
with
proper
management
become
as
cleanly
as
any
of
the
other
children
as
soon
as
a
child
is
taken
into
the
school
the
monitor
shows
him
a
certain
place
and
explains
to
him
that
when
he
wants
to
go
into
the
yard
he
is
to
ask
him
and
he
will
accompany
him
there
of
course
there
are
separate
accommodations
for
each
sex
and
such
prudential
arrangements
made
as
the
case
requires
but
which
it
is
unnecessary
further
to
particularize
a
footnote
a
this
is
a
subject
of
the
highest
importance
in
moral
training
and
deserve
the
serious
attention
of
committees
as
well
as
teachers
inattention
to
these
matters
may
demoralize
every
child
that
enters
the
school
in
many
schools
throughout
the
country
i
have
seen
great
want
of
attention
to
this
subject
the
seats
were
too
high
the
circular
holes
too
large
causing
fear
on
the
part
of
the
infants
and
also
bad
habits
the
seats
should
be
the
same
height
as
the
seats
in
the
school
six
inches
and
nine
inches
high
the
diameter
of
the
holes
seven
inches
and
nine
inches
the
teachers
should
constantly
visit
these
places
inculcate
habits
of
delicacy
and
cleanliness
such
habits
formed
in
childhood
are
never
forgotten
superfine
dressy
teachers
will
be
too
proud
and
too
high
to
attend
to
these
things
but
the
judicious
mother
or
matron
will
at
once
see
their
importance
and
act
accordingly
as
the
twig
is
bent
the
inclined
never
frighten
children
it
is
common
for
many
persons
to
threaten
to
put
children
into
the
black
hole
or
to
call
the
sweep
to
take
them
away
in
his
bag
when
they
do
not
behave
as
they
ought
but
the
ill
effects
of
this
mode
of
proceeding
may
be
perceived
from
the
following
fact
i
knew
a
child
who
had
been
to
one
of
those
schools
where
the
children
of
mechanics
are
usually
sent
called
dames
schools
which
was
kept
by
an
elderly
woman
who
it
seems
had
put
this
child
into
the
and
told
him
that
unless
he
was
a
good
boy
the
black
man
would
come
and
take
him
away
this
so
frightened
the
child
that
he
fell
into
a
violent
fit
and
never
afterwards
could
bear
the
sight
of
this
woman
on
the
mother
getting
the
child
admitted
into
our
school
she
desired
me
to
be
very
gentle
with
him
relating
to
me
all
the
above
story
except
that
the
child
had
had
a
fit
about
a
fortnight
after
the
admission
of
the
child
he
came
running
one
day
into
the
school
exclaiming
be
a
good
boy
master
master
i
be
a
good
boy
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
me
he
clung
round
and
grasped
me
with
such
violence
that
i
really
thought
the
child
was
mad
in
a
few
minutes
after
this
he
went
into
strong
convulsions
and
was
such
a
dreadful
spectacle
that
i
thought
the
child
would
die
in
my
arms
in
this
state
he
remained
for
about
twenty
minutes
and
i
fully
expected
he
would
be
carried
out
of
the
school
a
corpse
i
sent
for
the
mother
but
on
her
arrival
i
perceived
she
was
less
alarmed
than
myself
she
immediately
said
the
child
was
in
a
fit
and
that
i
had
frightened
him
into
it
i
told
her
that
she
was
mistaken
that
the
child
had
only
just
entered
the
school
and
i
was
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
his
fright
but
several
of
my
little
scholars
soon
set
the
matter
to
rest
by
stating
the
particulars
of
the
fright
which
they
observed
when
coming
to
school
it
seems
that
a
man
was
in
the
street
who
sweeps
chimneys
with
a
machine
and
just
as
the
little
fellow
passed
him
he
called
out
sweep
this
so
alarmed
the
child
that
he
thought
the
man
was
going
to
take
him
and
was
affected
by
his
fears
in
the
way
i
have
stated
the
child
however
getting
better
and
the
mother
hearing
what
the
children
said
begged
my
pardon
for
having
accused
me
wrongfully
and
then
told
me
the
whole
particulars
of
his
first
fright
and
the
woman
and
the
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
imaginable
to
persuade
him
that
a
sweep
was
a
human
being
and
that
he
loved
little
children
as
much
as
other
persons
after
some
time
the
child
got
somewhat
the
better
of
his
fears
but
not
wholly
so
he
had
but
one
fit
afterwards
this
shews
how
improper
it
is
to
confine
children
by
themselves
or
to
threaten
them
in
the
manner
described
many
persons
continue
nervous
all
their
lives
through
such
treatment
and
are
so
materially
injured
that
they
are
frightened
at
their
own
shadow
it
is
also
productive
of
much
mischief
to
talk
of
mysteries
ghosts
and
hobgoblins
before
children
which
many
persons
are
too
apt
to
do
some
deal
so
much
in
the
marvellous
that
i
really
believe
they
frighten
many
children
out
of
their
senses
i
recollect
when
i
was
a
child
hearing
such
stories
till
i
have
actually
been
afraid
to
look
behind
me
how
many
persons
are
frightened
at
such
a
little
creature
as
a
mouse
because
the
nature
of
that
little
creature
has
not
been
explained
to
them
in
their
infancy
indeed
children
should
have
all
things
shewn
them
if
possible
that
they
are
likely
to
meet
with
and
above
all
it
should
be
impressed
upon
their
minds
that
if
they
meet
with
no
injury
from
the
living
it
is
most
certain
the
dead
will
never
hurt
them
and
that
he
who
fears
god
need
have
no
other
fear
it
is
also
common
with
many
persons
to
put
a
disobedient
child
into
a
room
by
itself
i
can
not
approve
of
this
method
as
the
child
is
frequently
frightened
into
quietness
without
improving
his
temper
in
the
least
if
it
be
day
time
it
is
not
so
bad
but
if
it
be
dark
the
consequences
are
often
serious
and
materially
injure
the
constitution
of
the
child
the
more
i
reflect
upon
this
subject
the
more
do
i
see
its
impropriety
i
would
rather
use
the
rod
in
moderation
and
mercy
i
am
sure
it
is
better
for
the
disobedient
and
unruly
child
and
more
according
to
the
dealings
of
the
creator
with
us
all
i
can
truly
say
my
punishments
which
have
not
been
slight
have
done
me
good
as
children
we
can
not
see
these
things
as
men
and
thinkers
we
can
yea
and
kiss
the
rod
guard
against
forgetfulness
the
circumstance
i
am
about
to
mention
shews
how
necessary
it
is
to
teach
by
example
as
well
as
precept
many
of
the
children
were
in
the
habit
of
bringing
marbles
tops
whistles
and
other
toys
to
the
school
which
often
caused
much
disturbance
for
they
would
play
with
them
instead
of
attending
to
their
lessons
and
i
found
it
necessary
to
forbid
the
children
from
bringing
anything
of
the
kind
after
giving
notice
therefore
two
or
three
times
in
the
school
i
told
them
that
if
any
of
them
brought
such
things
they
would
be
taken
away
from
them
in
consequence
of
this
several
things
fell
into
my
hands
which
i
did
not
always
think
of
returning
and
among
other
things
a
whistle
belonging
to
a
little
boy
the
child
asked
me
for
it
as
he
was
going
home
but
having
several
visitors
at
the
time
put
him
off
telling
him
not
to
plague
me
and
he
went
home
i
had
forgotten
the
circumstance
altogether
but
it
appears
the
child
had
not
for
some
time
after
while
i
was
lecturing
the
children
upon
the
necessity
of
telling
truth
and
on
the
wickedness
of
stealing
the
little
fellow
approached
me
and
said
sir
you
stole
my
stole
your
whistle
said
i
did
i
not
give
it
you
again
no
teacher
i
asked
you
for
it
and
you
would
not
give
it
to
me
i
stood
being
accused
in
the
middle
of
my
lecture
before
all
the
children
and
really
at
a
loss
to
know
what
excuse
to
make
for
i
had
mislaid
the
whistle
and
could
not
return
it
to
the
child
i
immediately
gave
the
child
a
halfpenny
and
said
all
i
could
to
persuade
the
children
that
it
was
not
my
intention
to
keep
it
however
i
am
satisfied
that
this
trifling
mistake
of
mine
did
more
harm
than
i
was
able
to
repair
during
some
time
for
if
we
wish
to
teach
children
to
be
honest
we
should
never
take
anything
from
them
without
returning
it
again
indeed
persons
having
charge
of
children
can
never
be
too
cautious
and
should
not
on
any
account
whatever
break
a
promise
for
experience
has
taught
me
that
most
children
have
good
memories
and
if
you
once
promise
a
thing
and
do
not
perform
it
they
will
pay
very
little
attention
to
what
you
say
afterwards
observe
punctuality
a
little
girl
whose
mother
was
dead
was
often
absent
from
school
she
was
never
at
a
loss
for
excuses
but
from
their
frequency
i
was
at
last
induced
to
suspect
their
truth
none
of
the
children
knew
where
she
resided
so
i
was
obliged
to
send
the
eldest
boy
in
the
school
home
with
her
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
her
stories
were
true
i
gave
the
boy
positive
directions
to
make
haste
back
but
much
to
my
surprise
i
saw
no
more
of
him
for
six
hours
when
he
returned
he
told
me
that
the
little
girl
refused
to
shew
him
where
she
lived
and
had
taken
him
so
far
that
he
at
last
determined
to
leave
her
but
could
not
find
his
way
back
sooner
in
the
evening
i
went
myself
according
to
the
direction
i
had
entered
in
the
but
found
that
the
family
were
removed
and
the
persons
in
the
house
could
not
tell
me
where
they
had
gone
to
reside
i
saw
nothing
of
the
child
for
the
five
following
days
when
a
woman
who
had
the
care
of
her
and
her
little
brother
in
arms
came
to
inquire
the
reason
why
the
girl
came
home
at
such
irregular
hours
stating
that
sometimes
she
came
home
at
eleven
at
other
times
not
till
two
and
sometimes
at
three
in
the
afternoon
in
short
often
an
hour
after
school
was
over
i
told
her
that
the
child
was
frequently
absent
and
that
it
was
five
days
since
i
had
seen
her
the
woman
appeared
quite
surprised
and
told
me
that
she
had
always
sent
the
child
to
school
at
the
regular
time
that
when
she
came
home
before
the
usual
hour
she
said
her
governess
had
sent
all
the
children
home
a
little
sooner
and
if
she
came
home
after
the
time
then
she
said
that
there
had
been
some
ladies
visiting
the
school
and
that
the
children
had
been
kept
for
their
inspection
here
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
have
frequently
detained
children
a
little
while
after
when
we
have
had
visitors
but
since
it
furnishes
the
children
with
an
excuse
for
going
home
late
i
think
it
would
be
better
to
discontinue
the
practice
and
would
hint
to
those
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
feel
inclined
to
visit
such
schools
that
they
should
come
between
the
hours
of
nine
and
twelve
in
the
forenoon
or
two
and
four
in
the
afternoon
i
have
only
to
observe
that
the
child
i
have
been
speaking
of
came
to
the
school
very
regularly
afterwards
there
is
another
subject
too
important
to
be
passed
without
notice
i
mean
the
punctual
attendance
of
the
pupils
if
the
teachers
are
firm
and
determined
to
secure
this
can
be
in
ireland
where
the
value
of
time
and
punctuality
is
least
understood
the
thing
was
accomplished
whilst
no
better
lesson
can
be
given
to
those
who
have
to
work
for
their
daily
bread
than
punctuality
if
a
child
can
not
attend
school
at
nine
how
can
it
attend
work
at
six
in
the
morning
be
firm
and
the
object
is
gained
be
strictly
accurate
in
your
expressions
one
day
when
the
children
were
assembled
in
the
gallery
having
none
of
their
usual
lessons
at
hand
i
took
from
my
pocket
a
piece
of
paper
and
promised
them
that
if
they
would
answer
me
every
question
i
put
concerning
the
paper
i
would
at
last
make
a
paper
boat
i
proceeded
in
the
following
manner
what
is
this
what
colour
what
is
its
use
how
made
what
made
of
these
questions
being
answered
according
to
their
different
views
and
having
folded
the
paper
into
a
variety
of
forms
and
obtained
their
ideas
upon
such
forms
i
proceeded
to
fulfil
my
promise
of
forming
it
into
the
shape
of
a
boat
but
the
children
seeing
me
at
a
loss
exclaimed
please
sir
you
ca
do
it
which
proved
the
fact
as
i
had
forgotten
the
plan
and
was
obliged
to
make
the
confession
then
sir
rejoined
one
of
the
boys
you
should
not
have
promised
in
the
course
of
my
observations
i
had
frequently
enjoined
the
children
to
make
every
possible
use
of
their
thinking
powers
but
it
appears
i
had
at
the
same
time
forgotten
to
make
use
of
my
own
and
consequently
had
been
betrayed
into
a
promise
which
i
was
not
able
to
perform
i
remember
some
other
instances
one
of
the
children
happened
to
kick
another
the
injured
party
complained
to
the
person
who
then
had
the
charge
of
the
school
saying
please
sir
this
boy
kicked
me
it
being
time
for
the
children
to
leave
school
the
master
waved
his
hand
towards
the
gate
through
which
the
children
pass
thoughtlessly
saying
at
the
same
time
kick
away
meaning
that
the
complainant
was
to
take
no
more
notice
of
the
affair
but
go
home
the
complainant
however
returning
to
the
other
child
began
kicking
him
and
received
some
kicks
himself
a
friend
was
present
and
seeing
two
children
kicking
each
other
he
very
naturally
inquired
the
reason
please
sir
replied
the
children
master
told
us
master
told
you
says
the
gentleman
that
can
not
be
i
ask
him
he
accordingly
inquired
into
the
truth
of
the
affair
and
received
for
answer
certainly
not
yes
said
the
child
you
did
sir
did
not
i
tell
you
just
now
that
a
boy
kicked
me
yes
says
the
master
you
did
then
please
sir
says
the
child
you
told
me
to
go
and
kick
away
the
master
immediately
recollected
that
he
had
said
so
this
fact
shews
how
improper
it
is
to
say
one
thing
to
a
child
and
mean
another
these
children
were
under
the
influence
of
obedience
in
the
light
of
and
being
in
that
light
they
could
see
from
no
other
and
very
naturally
concluded
the
master
meant
what
he
had
said
one
day
some
visitors
requested
i
would
call
out
a
class
of
the
children
to
be
examined
having
done
so
i
asked
the
visitors
in
what
they
would
wish
the
children
to
be
examined
at
the
same
time
stating
that
they
might
hear
the
children
examined
in
natural
history
scriptural
history
arithmetic
spelling
geography
or
geometry
they
choose
the
latter
and
i
proceded
to
examine
the
children
accordingly
beginning
with
straight
lines
having
continued
this
examination
for
about
half
an
hour
we
proceeded
to
enter
into
particulars
respecting
triangles
and
having
discoursed
on
the
difference
between
isosceles
triangles
and
scalene
triangles
i
observed
that
an
acute
isosceles
triangle
had
all
its
angles
acute
and
proceeded
to
observe
that
a
scalene
triangle
had
all
its
angles
acute
the
children
immediately
began
to
laugh
for
which
i
was
at
a
loss
to
account
and
told
them
of
the
impropriety
of
laughing
at
me
one
of
the
children
immediately
replied
please
sir
do
you
know
what
we
were
laughing
at
i
replied
in
the
negative
then
sir
says
the
boy
i
will
tell
you
please
sir
you
have
made
a
blunder
i
thinking
i
had
not
proceeded
to
defend
myself
when
the
children
replied
please
sir
you
convict
yourself
i
replied
how
so
why
says
the
children
you
said
a
triangle
had
one
right
angle
and
that
all
its
angles
are
acute
if
it
has
one
right
angle
how
can
all
its
angles
be
acute
i
soon
perceived
the
children
were
right
and
that
i
was
wrong
here
then
the
reader
may
perceive
the
fruits
of
teaching
the
children
to
think
inasmuch
as
it
is
shewn
that
children
of
six
years
of
age
and
under
were
able
to
refute
their
tutor
if
children
had
been
taught
to
think
many
years
ago
error
would
have
been
much
more
easily
detected
and
its
baneful
influence
would
not
have
had
that
effect
upon
society
which
at
this
day
unfortunately
we
are
obliged
to
witness
at
another
time
i
was
lecturing
the
children
in
the
gallery
on
the
subject
of
cruelty
to
animals
when
one
of
the
little
children
observed
please
sir
my
big
brother
catches
the
poor
flies
and
then
sticks
a
pin
through
them
and
makes
them
draw
the
pin
along
the
table
this
afforded
me
an
excellent
opportunity
of
appealing
to
their
feelings
on
the
enormity
of
this
offence
and
among
other
things
i
observed
that
if
the
poor
fly
had
been
gifted
with
the
powers
of
speech
like
their
own
it
probably
would
have
exclaimed
as
follows
you
naughty
child
how
can
you
think
of
torturing
me
so
is
there
not
room
in
the
world
for
you
and
me
did
i
ever
do
you
any
harm
does
it
do
you
any
good
to
put
me
in
such
pain
why
do
you
do
it
you
are
big
enough
to
know
better
how
would
you
like
a
man
to
run
a
piece
of
wire
through
your
body
and
make
you
draw
things
about
would
you
not
cry
at
the
pain
go
then
you
wicked
boy
and
learn
to
leave
off
such
cruel
actions
having
finished
one
of
the
children
replied
how
can
any
thing
speak
if
it
is
dead
why
said
i
supposing
it
could
speak
you
meant
to
say
sir
was
the
rejoinder
instead
of
it
will
of
course
be
understood
that
in
this
case
i
purposely
misused
a
word
and
the
children
being
taught
to
think
easily
detected
it
watch
against
the
entrance
of
disease
it
may
probably
be
considered
presumption
in
me
to
speak
of
the
diseases
of
children
as
this
more
properly
belongs
to
the
faculty
but
let
it
be
observed
that
my
pretension
is
not
to
cure
the
diseases
that
children
are
subject
to
but
only
to
prevent
those
which
are
infectious
from
spreading
i
have
found
that
children
between
the
ages
of
two
and
seven
years
are
subject
to
the
measles
hooping
cough
fever
ophthalmia
ringworm
and
in
very
poor
neighbourhoods
the
itch
and
this
last
is
very
rare
owing
to
the
great
encouragement
given
to
vaccination
and
were
it
not
for
the
obstinacy
of
many
of
the
poor
i
believe
it
would
be
totally
extirpated
during
the
whole
of
the
time
i
superintended
a
school
i
heard
of
only
three
children
dying
of
it
and
those
had
never
been
vaccinated
i
always
made
a
point
of
inquiring
on
the
admission
of
a
child
whether
this
operation
had
been
performed
and
if
not
i
strongly
recommended
that
it
should
be
if
parents
spoke
the
truth
i
had
but
few
children
in
the
school
who
had
not
been
vaccinated
this
accounts
therefore
for
having
lost
but
three
children
through
the
the
measles
however
i
consider
a
very
dangerous
disorder
and
we
lost
a
great
many
children
by
it
besides
two
of
my
own
it
is
preceded
by
a
violent
cough
the
child
eyes
appear
watery
and
it
will
also
be
sick
as
soon
as
these
symptoms
are
perceived
i
would
immediately
send
the
child
home
and
desire
the
parents
to
keep
it
there
for
a
few
days
in
order
to
ascertain
if
it
have
the
measles
and
if
so
it
must
be
prohibited
from
returning
to
school
until
well
this
caution
is
absolutely
necessary
as
some
parents
are
so
careless
that
they
will
send
their
children
when
the
measles
are
thick
out
upon
them
the
same
may
be
said
with
respect
to
other
diseases
for
unless
the
persons
who
have
charge
of
the
school
attend
to
these
things
the
parents
will
be
glad
to
get
their
children
out
of
the
way
and
will
send
them
though
much
afflicted
without
considering
the
that
may
be
produced
in
the
school
whether
such
conduct
in
the
parents
proceeds
from
ignorance
or
not
i
am
not
able
to
say
but
this
i
know
that
i
have
had
many
parents
offer
children
for
admission
with
all
the
diseases
i
have
mentioned
and
who
manifested
no
disposition
to
inform
me
of
it
the
number
of
children
who
may
be
sick
from
time
to
time
may
be
averaged
at
from
twenty
to
out
of
two
hundred
we
have
never
had
less
than
twenty
absent
on
account
of
illness
and
once
or
twice
we
had
as
many
as
fifty
soon
after
i
first
took
charge
of
the
establishment
i
found
that
there
were
five
or
six
children
in
the
school
who
had
the
measles
the
consequence
was
that
it
contaminated
the
whole
school
and
about
eight
children
died
one
of
my
own
being
of
that
number
this
induced
me
to
be
very
cautious
in
future
and
i
made
a
point
of
walking
round
the
school
twice
every
day
in
order
to
inspect
the
children
and
after
the
adoption
of
this
plan
we
did
not
have
the
measles
in
the
school
the
is
known
of
course
by
the
child
hooping
but
i
consider
it
the
safest
plan
to
send
all
children
home
that
have
any
kind
of
cough
this
will
cause
the
mother
to
come
and
inquire
the
reason
why
the
child
is
sent
home
and
it
can
be
ascertained
from
her
whether
the
child
has
had
the
or
not
with
respect
to
fever
i
generally
find
the
children
appear
chilly
and
cold
and
not
unfrequently
they
are
sick
i
do
not
however
feel
myself
competent
to
describe
the
early
symptoms
of
this
disorder
but
the
best
way
to
prevent
its
gaining
ground
in
the
school
is
to
send
all
the
children
home
who
appear
the
least
indisposed
as
to
the
ophthalmia
i
can
describe
the
symptoms
of
that
disease
having
had
it
myself
together
with
the
whole
of
my
family
it
generally
comes
in
the
left
eye
first
and
causes
a
sensation
as
if
something
was
in
the
eye
which
pricks
and
shoots
and
produces
great
pain
the
white
of
the
eye
will
appear
red
or
what
is
usually
called
this
if
not
speedily
attended
to
will
cause
blindness
i
have
had
several
children
that
have
been
blind
with
it
for
several
days
in
the
morning
the
patients
are
not
able
to
unclose
their
eyes
for
some
time
after
they
are
awake
as
soon
as
i
observe
these
appearances
i
immediately
send
the
child
home
for
i
have
ascertained
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
disease
is
contagious
and
if
a
child
be
suffered
to
remain
with
it
in
the
school
the
infection
will
speedily
spread
among
the
children
as
children
are
frequently
apt
to
burn
or
scald
themselves
i
will
here
insert
a
method
for
adoption
in
such
cases
it
is
very
simple
yet
infallible
at
least
i
have
never
known
it
to
fail
it
is
no
other
than
the
application
of
common
writing
ink
one
of
my
own
children
burnt
its
hand
dreadfully
and
was
cured
by
immediately
washing
it
all
over
with
that
liquid
several
children
burnt
their
hands
against
the
pipe
that
was
connected
with
the
stove
in
the
and
were
cured
by
the
same
means
one
boy
in
particular
took
hold
of
a
hot
cinder
that
fell
from
the
fire
and
it
quite
singed
his
hand
i
applied
ink
to
it
and
it
was
cured
in
a
very
short
time
let
any
one
therefore
who
may
happen
to
receive
a
burn
apply
ink
to
it
immediately
and
he
will
soon
witness
the
good
effects
of
the
application
years
experience
has
proved
to
me
that
in
any
school
are
a
nuisance
the
common
fire
place
is
better
than
heating
with
hot
air
hot
water
or
stoves
of
any
description
that
i
have
yet
seen
the
grate
being
low
as
at
railway
stations
is
an
improvement
and
answers
well
had
theorists
seen
the
white
faced
dull
eyed
children
that
i
have
seen
where
stoves
are
used
and
felt
the
head
aches
which
i
have
felt
they
would
soon
banish
them
from
every
school
never
correct
a
child
in
anger
never
overlook
a
fault
in
all
things
set
before
the
children
an
example
worthy
of
imitation
i
should
recommend
the
adoption
of
the
following
resolutions
of
an
intelligent
and
zealous
committee
and
that
a
copy
of
them
be
sent
to
each
master
and
mistress
that
as
this
infant
school
is
established
for
the
express
purpose
of
carrying
into
the
fullest
effect
the
system
of
wilderspin
which
the
committee
are
convinced
is
practicable
and
excellent
the
master
be
desired
to
make
himself
perfectly
acquainted
with
it
in
its
physical
mental
and
moral
bearings
by
a
study
of
works
on
the
subject
and
particularly
of
the
last
and
most
complete
edition
that
the
rules
as
printed
be
strictly
adhered
to
by
the
master
that
children
who
are
ill
having
ringworm
or
other
contagious
disease
be
refused
admission
until
perfectly
restored
that
the
business
of
the
school
begin
precisely
at
the
time
appointed
and
that
during
the
shortest
days
the
signals
for
leaving
school
be
not
given
till
four
precisely
that
except
during
the
time
given
according
to
the
system
to
play
the
whole
be
occupied
by
the
mistress
as
well
as
the
master
in
the
instruction
of
the
children
and
that
the
plan
laid
down
in
wilderspin
book
be
followed
as
nearly
as
possible
so
that
the
apparatus
already
provided
may
be
gradually
brought
into
action
and
the
children
have
all
the
advantages
of
the
system
the
master
and
mistress
so
dividing
their
labour
that
all
the
children
may
be
occupied
that
the
master
and
mistress
pay
the
utmost
attention
to
the
children
learning
to
read
that
when
a
child
is
absent
a
week
the
master
state
the
cause
to
the
treasurer
to
prevent
mistakes
as
to
the
payments
and
that
when
a
child
declines
attending
or
is
excluded
immediate
notice
be
given
to
the
secretary
of
the
ladies
committee
that
the
master
be
desired
to
go
on
with
the
business
of
the
school
when
visitors
who
are
members
of
the
committee
are
present
and
only
to
pay
particular
attention
to
those
who
may
be
strangers
and
who
require
information
that
all
applications
from
the
master
be
made
to
the
committee
through
the
secretary
that
all
orders
from

no
part
of
the
infant
system
which
has
been
more
misunderstood
than
the
system
of
giving
lessons
in
the
gallery
and
hence
i
have
thought
it
necessary
to
devote
a
larger
space
to
the
subject
than
i
did
in
the
former
editions
of
this
work
the
gallery
was
originally
intended
by
me
to
give
the
children
such
lessons
as
appealed
directly
to
the
senses
either
orally
or
by
representative
objects
thus
the
teaching
arithmetic
by
the
frame
and
balls
inasmuch
as
it
appealed
to
the
eye
as
well
as
to
the
understanding
was
suitable
for
a
gallery
lesson
the
same
observations
hold
good
with
respect
to
a
scripture
picture
or
the
representation
of
an
animal
a
tree
or
any
object
that
can
be
presented
to
the
eye
we
have
also
found
it
very
useful
in
teaching
the
catechism
or
anything
that
is
to
be
committed
to
memory
and
this
part
of
our
plan
has
proved
so
useful
and
successful
that
it
has
been
adopted
in
many
schools
for
older
children
of
both
sexes
i
mean
in
the
normal
schools
of
glasgow
and
edinburgh
the
corporation
schools
of
liverpool
and
the
government
model
schools
at
dublin
in
the
two
latter
the
arrangements
both
in
the
fittings
up
of
the
galleries
and
were
made
under
my
especial
inspection
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
use
of
the
gallery
when
it
becomes
more
generally
known
in
large
schools
will
become
universal
the
taught
should
see
the
face
of
the
teacher
in
these
lessons
and
the
teacher
should
see
the
face
of
the
taught
it
establishes
a
sympathy
between
both
to
the
advantage
of
each
the
face
is
the
index
to
the
mind
and
at
times
shews
the
intention
even
without
words
some
animals
can
read
this
index
the
horse
the
dog
the
elephant
and
many
of
the
higher
order
of
animals
children
can
always
read
the
countenance
of
the
sincere
the
wise
and
the
good
yea
mere
infants
can
reader
do
smile
were
this
the
time
and
place
i
could
demonstrate
these
opinions
by
this
is
not
a
book
for
controversy
and
metaphysical
disquisition
but
for
use
to
teachers
when
the
children
and
teachers
see
each
other
as
in
the
gallery
the
effect
is
highly
beneficial
this
may
be
proved
by
any
teacher
as
to
the
cause
for
this
effect
it
would
be
out
of
place
to
argue
it
here
i
therefore
simply
state
it
is
true
sympathy
is
a
power
destined
to
be
of
use
in
teaching
and
hereafter
will
be
better
understood
many
friends
to
infant
education
and
casual
visitors
having
found
these
erections
in
infant
schools
have
concluded
that
the
children
should
always
be
sitting
on
them
which
is
a
fatal
error
and
deprives
the
children
of
that
part
of
the
system
which
legislates
for
the
exercise
of
their
locomotive
powers
such
as
the
spelling
and
reading
lessons
and
the
method
of
teaching
object
lessons
as
described
in
another
part
of
this
work
the
consequence
has
been
that
the
schools
have
become
mere
and
the
children
are
restless
and
inattentive
and
this
has
not
been
the
only
evil
that
has
attended
a
misapplication
of
the
gallery
for
the
teachers
for
want
of
knowing
the
system
properly
have
been
at
a
loss
how
to
occupy
the
time
of
the
children
and
scores
of
teachers
have
ruined
their
own
constitutions
and
also
the
constitutions
of
some
of
the
children
by
the
perpetual
talking
and
singing
which
i
am
sorry
to
say
too
many
consider
to
be
the
sum
total
of
the
system
and
i
may
state
here
that
the
children
should
never
be
more
than
one
hour
at
a
time
or
at
most
two
hours
during
the
day
in
the
gallery
all
beyond
this
is
injurious
to
the
teacher
and
doubly
so
to
the
little
pupils
the
forenoon
is
always
the
best
time
for
gallery
lessons
the
teacher
mind
is
more
clear
and
the
minds
of
the
children
are
more
receptive
after
the
children
have
taken
their
dinner
they
should
be
entertained
with
the
object
lessons
a
small
portion
of
spelling
and
reading
and
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
should
be
devoted
to
moral
and
physical
teaching
in
the
if
the
weather
will
at
all
permit
it
the
more
you
rob
your
children
of
their
physical
education
to
shew
off
their
intellectual
acquirements
the
more
injury
you
do
their
health
and
your
own
and
in
the
effort
to
do
too
much
you
violate
the
laws
of
nature
defeat
your
own
object
and
make
the
school
a
of
precocity
instead
of
a
rational
infants
school
for
the
training
and
educating
infants
i
have
been
blamed
by
writers
on
the
infant
system
for
that
which
i
never
did
and
never
recommended
i
have
been
made
answerable
for
the
errors
and
of
others
who
have
not
troubled
themselves
to
read
my
writings
and
in
their
anxiety
to
produce
something
new
and
original
have
strayed
from
the
very
essential
parts
of
the
plan
and
on
this
account
i
am
charged
by
several
writers
with
being
unacquainted
with
the
philosophy
of
my
own
system
i
thought
years
ago
that
if
i
could
arrest
public
attention
to
the
subject
it
was
as
much
as
could
be
expected
i
knew
very
well
at
that
time
that
a
dry
philosophical
detail
would
neither
be
received
or
read
my
object
was
to
appeal
to
the
senses
of
the
public
by
doing
the
thing
in
every
town
where
practicable
by
this
method
i
succeeded
where
the
other
would
have
failed
but
it
by
no
means
followed
that
i
was
unacquainted
with
the
philosophy
of
my
own
plans
merely
because
i
preferred
the
doing
of
the
thing
to
the
writing
about
it
believing
however
that
the
time
has
now
arrived
and
that
the
public
mind
is
better
prepared
than
it
was
then
i
have
thought
i
might
venture
to
go
a
little
more
into
detail
in
order
to
remove
some
well
founded
objections
which
but
for
this
reason
would
not
have
existed
the
infant
mind
like
a
tender
plant
requires
to
be
handled
and
dealt
with
carefully
for
if
it
be
forced
and
injudiciously
treated
during
the
first
seven
years
of
its
existence
it
will
affect
its
whole
constitution
as
long
as
it
lives
afterwards
there
are
hundreds
of
persons
who
will
not
believe
this
and
those
persons
will
employ
mere
boys
and
girls
to
teach
infants
let
them
do
so
if
they
please
i
simply
protest
against
it
and
merely
give
it
as
my
opinion
that
it
is
highly
improper
to
do
so
if
ever
infant
schools
are
to
become
real
blessings
to
the
country
they
must
be
placed
under
the
care
of
wise
discreet
and
experienced
persons
for
no
others
will
be
fit
or
able
to
develop
and
cultivate
the
infant
faculties
aright
i
have
felt
it
necessary
to
make
these
remarks
because
in
different
parts
of
the
country
i
have
found
mere
children
employed
as
and
to
the
great
detriment
of
the
young
committed
to
their
charge
and
the
dishonour
of
the
country
that
permits
it
no
wise
man
would
put
a
mere
child
to
break
his
colts
none
but
a
foolish
one
would
employ
an
inexperienced
boy
to
break
in
his
dogs
even
the
poultry
and
pigs
would
be
attended
by
a
person
who
knew
something
about
them
but
almost
any
creature
who
can
read
and
write
and
is
acquainted
with
the
first
rules
of
arithmetic
is
too
frequently
thought
a
fit
and
proper
person
to
superintend
infants
i
know
many
instances
of
discarded
servants
totally
unfit
made
teachers
of
infants
merely
to
put
them
in
place
to
the
destruction
of
the
highest
and
most
noble
of
god
creatures
which
i
contend
infants
are
to
expect
that
such
persons
can
give
gallery
lessons
as
they
ought
to
be
given
is
expecting
what
will
never
nor
can
take
place
the
public
must
possess
different
views
of
the
subject
more
rational
ideas
on
the
art
of
teaching
must
be
entertained
and
greater
remuneration
must
be
given
to
teachers
and
greater
efforts
made
to
train
and
educate
them
to
fit
them
for
the
office
before
any
very
beneficial
results
can
be
seen
and
it
is
to
produce
such
results
and
a
better
tone
of
feeling
on
the
subject
that
i
have
thus
ventured
to
give
my
opinion
more
in
detail
efficient
gallery
lessons
efficient
teachers
must
be
made
they
do
not
at
present
exist
in
large
numbers
and
can
only
be
made
by
a
suitable
reward
being
held
out
to
them
and
by
their
being
placed
under
the
superintendence
of
experienced
persons
acquainted
with
the
art
the
art
of
teaching
is
no
mean
art
and
must
sooner
or
later
take
its
proper
rank
amongst
the
other
sciences
it
is
a
science
which
requires
deep
study
and
knowledge
of
human
character
and
is
only
to
be
learned
like
all
other
sciences
by
much
perseverance
and
practice
in
another
work
on
the
education
of
older
children
i
have
given
some
specimens
of
gallery
lessons
in
this
i
shall
endeavour
to
give
a
few
specimens
of
what
i
think
useful
lessons
for
infants
and
shall
also
try
to
clothe
them
in
language
suited
to
the
infant
apprehensions
and
i
sincerely
hope
they
may
shew
in
a
plain
manner
the
method
of
giving
this
species
of
instruction
to
the
children
and
that
teachers
who
were
before
ignorant
of
it
may
be
benefitted
thereby
i
shall
not
pretend
to
give
my
opinion
as
to
whether
i
have
succeeded
but
will
leave
this
point
entirely
to
the
judgment
and
candour
of
my
readers
for
i
know
by
experience
that
it
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
put
practice
into
theory
and
although
this
may
seem
paradoxical
yet
i
have
no
doubt
that
many
have
experienced
the
very
same
results
when
trying
to
explain
theoretically
on
paper
what
they
have
with
ease
practised
a
thousand
times
these
oral
lessons
on
real
objects
ought
to
be
given
in
pure
simple
and
plain
language
level
to
the
understanding
and
capacity
of
children
it
may
be
well
at
times
to
use
words
of
a
more
difficult
or
scientific
character
but
these
should
always
have
the
proper
explanation
given
the
words
used
most
frequently
in
common
life
in
ordinary
and
proper
conversation
ought
to
be
most
strongly
impressed
on
their
memories
it
may
perhaps
be
retorted
on
me
why
then
teach
the
difficult
and
scientific
names
of
geometrical
figures
the
answer
is
very
simple
most
of
them
have
no
other
and
where
they
have
i
always
give
them
also
as
sloping
slanting
inclined
for
oblique
the
geometrical
figures
are
the
elements
of
all
forms
and
the
simplest
objects
which
can
be
presented
to
the
young
i
have
found
them
always
learned
with
the
greatest
ease
and
pleasure
pestalozzi
i
have
understood
was
led
to
the
use
of
them
by
observing
the
wants
of
the
young
mind
in
a
similar
manner
that
i
was
myself
this
is
therefore
one
of
the
many
coincidences
in
thought
and
discovery
by
minds
wholly
independent
of
each
other
which
have
been
directed
to
the
same
subjects
this
is
an
evitable
result
if
two
men
look
at
the
moon
both
must
see
that
it
is
round
bright
and
mottled
and
if
two
minds
far
apart
turn
their
attention
to
similar
subjects
the
probability
is
that
their
views
will
coincide
the
most
powerful
mind
will
of
course
make
the
deepest
and
simplest
discovery
object
lessons
should
be
given
chiefly
on
such
things
as
fall
under
more
constant
observation
and
are
daily
coming
before
the
sight
and
then
useful
knowledge
will
be
accumulated
and
frequently
reimpressed
upon
the
memory
by
the
seeing
of
the
objects
gallery
lessons
on
a
feather
we
will
suppose
the
children
all
properly
seated
the
little
girls
on
one
side
of
the
gallery
and
the
little
boys
on
the
other
as
represented
on
the
if
the
morning
is
fine
and
clear
a
lesson
may
be
given
on
an
object
that
the
children
are
not
frequently
in
the
habit
of
seeing
but
should
the
weather
be
hazy
and
the
atmosphere
heavy
then
a
lesson
must
be
given
on
some
object
which
they
all
frequently
see
say
for
example
a
feather
the
feather
must
be
held
up
in
the
hand
or
placed
in
a
small
niche
on
the
top
of
a
pointer
so
that
every
child
will
see
it
and
it
must
be
moved
about
in
various
directions
to
arrest
their
attention
the
first
lesson
should
be
pure
development
which
is
to
get
every
idea
from
the
children
relative
to
the
object
before
you
explain
to
them
yours
as
for
example
what
is
this
the
universal
shout
will
be
a
feather
you
may
then
ask
them
what
are
its
uses
some
little
creatures
will
say
to
blow
about
others
will
say
to
cover
birds
others
will
say
to
stuff
pillows
and
beds
to
sleep
upon
having
got
all
the
information
out
of
them
you
can
in
their
own
simple
language
you
have
acted
according
to
nature
law
and
it
is
now
your
turn
to
infuse
additional
information
into
their
minds
and
give
them
the
benefit
of
your
superior
knowledge
which
may
be
done
as
follows
you
have
told
me
that
feathers
are
useful
to
cover
birds
it
was
for
this
that
they
were
made
by
god
they
keep
the
birds
warm
just
in
the
same
way
as
your
clothes
keep
you
from
being
cold
and
as
the
poor
birds
can
not
make
themselves
clothes
as
men
can
god
has
given
them
feathers
that
they
may
not
be
cold
when
the
bad
weather
comes
the
feathers
are
useful
to
the
birds
also
in
flying
the
long
feathers
in
a
bird
wing
keep
him
in
the
air
which
he
could
not
fly
through
if
he
was
covered
with
any
thing
else
because
feathers
are
very
light
seven
of
the
large
feathers
out
of
the
great
eagle
wing
would
not
weigh
more
than
two
halfpennies
the
wings
of
a
bird
make
him
able
to
fly
and
the
tail
guides
him
through
the
air
just
as
you
may
see
the
men
steer
boats
with
the
rudder
and
if
you
pulled
the
feathers
off
his
tail
he
would
not
be
able
to
fly
near
so
straight
or
fast
as
when
they
are
on
when
the
rain
falls
on
the
feathers
they
are
never
soaked
through
with
it
as
a
piece
of
rag
would
be
if
you
threw
water
on
it
because
they
are
covered
with
a
sort
of
oil
which
does
not
let
in
the
water
if
you
ever
look
at
a
duck
dive
into
the
water
you
can
see
it
when
it
comes
up
quite
dry
but
if
you
dipped
you
head
into
the
water
it
would
wet
it
all
over
when
little
birds
such
as
the
sparrow
and
canary
come
out
of
the
egg
they
have
no
feathers
on
but
the
old
ones
cover
them
with
their
wings
to
keep
the
cold
away
and
the
feathers
soon
grow
and
then
they
can
fly
away
and
find
food
and
make
nests
for
themselves
but
large
birds
such
as
the
goose
turkey
hen
and
duck
have
a
sort
of
soft
down
on
them
when
they
come
out
of
the
shell
and
little
ducks
will
go
and
swim
as
soon
as
they
are
hatched
as
i
suppose
some
of
you
have
seen
some
birds
feathers
are
much
prettier
than
others
the
goose
has
not
such
pretty
feathers
as
the
swan
nor
the
swan
as
the
peacock
but
we
must
not
think
ill
of
the
goose
for
this
for
its
flesh
is
better
to
eat
than
either
the
peacock
or
swan
i
am
sure
many
of
you
little
children
like
roast
goose
the
peacock
has
very
pretty
feathers
indeed
and
so
has
the
pheasant
and
the
drake
and
the
cock
but
some
birds
that
live
in
countries
many
hundred
miles
away
from
this
have
much
prettier
than
any
bird
that
lives
in
this
country
this
feather
that
we
have
for
our
lesson
is
the
feather
of
a
goose
it
is
not
very
pretty
but
if
we
examine
it
well
we
shall
find
it
is
very
curious
and
all
the
men
in
the
world
could
not
make
one
like
it
goose
feathers
are
the
most
useful
the
small
ones
make
stuffing
for
pillows
and
beds
and
the
large
ones
make
pens
to
write
with
birds
change
their
feathers
often
they
drop
off
and
they
get
new
ones
this
is
called
moulting
having
thus
given
the
children
as
much
information
on
the
subject
as
they
will
be
likely
to
be
able
to
digest
properly
you
may
then
get
it
back
from
them
by
question
and
answer
as
for
instance
q
what
have
we
been
talking
about
a
birds
feathers
q
do
they
do
the
birds
any
good
a
yes
keep
them
warm
q
what
more
good
a
make
them
able
to
fly
q
who
gives
the
birds
feathers
to
make
them
warm
a
god
q
are
feathers
very
heavy
a
no
very
light
q
what
is
the
reason
that
they
are
very
light
a
that
they
may
fly
easily
q
what
part
of
the
body
does
a
bird
fly
with
a
its
wings
q
is
no
other
part
useful
in
flying
a
yes
q
do
you
remember
what
part
a
its
tail
q
of
what
use
is
its
tail
a
to
guide
it
q
what
do
you
mean
by
guiding
it
a
turning
it
any
way
it
wants
to
go
q
what
is
the
reason
that
birds
feathers
do
not
get
all
full
of
wet
when
the
rain
falls
on
them
a
because
there
is
an
oily
juice
that
makes
the
rain
fall
off
q
when
little
birds
such
as
sparrows
and
robins
come
out
of
the
eggs
have
they
got
feathers
a
no
they
are
naked
q
are
they
very
long
naked
a
no
in
a
few
days
the
feathers
grow
q
is
it
not
curious
that
the
cold
does
not
kill
the
little
birds
while
they
are
naked
a
so
it
would
only
the
old
ones
sit
over
them
and
keep
them
warm
q
are
ducks
and
turkeys
and
hens
naked
when
the
come
out
of
the
shell
a
no
q
what
are
they
covered
with
a
a
sort
of
down
q
do
you
know
of
any
bird
that
has
very
pretty
feathers
a
yes
the
peacock
q
is
it
prettier
than
the
goose
a
yes
q
is
it
so
useful
a
no
q
what
do
the
goose
feathers
make
a
the
feathers
in
the
quill
make
pelts
q
what
do
the
small
ones
make
a
they
make
stuffing
for
pillows
and
beds
q
where
do
the
prettiest
birds
live
a
in
very
warm
places
far
away
from
this
q
do
the
same
feathers
always
remain
on
a
bird
a
no
they
drop
off
and
new
ones
come
q
what
is
this
called
moulting
such
lessons
as
this
will
never
be
forgotten
by
the
little
ones
they
will
learn
to
adore
the
great
god
at
the
sight
of
any
thing
he
has
made
it
is
hoped
they
learn
to
love
to
read
nature
book
when
they
grow
older
as
every
correct
notion
obtained
by
a
child
through
a
natural
object
which
it
is
frequently
accustomed
to
meet
with
can
never
be
entirely
effaced
and
what
is
more
it
prepares
the
way
at
some
future
time
for
a
larger
amount
of
knowledge
as
to
revealed
will
a
spider
a
living
specimen
of
which
may
be
easily
procured
may
be
made
a
very
instructive
gallery
lesson
it
may
prevent
the
fears
and
foolish
prejudices
against
ugly
yet
harmless
insects
which
often
remain
through
life
part
of
a
bush
may
be
procured
with
a
real
web
and
spider
upon
it
so
that
its
beautiful
and
highly
curious
web
may
be
also
exhibited
to
the
children
its
uses
may
be
also
pointed
out
and
a
short
history
of
the
little
animal
habits
may
be
given
but
not
before
their
opinions
have
been
taken
on
the
object
which
may
be
done
in
a
similar
manner
as
that
which
we
pointed
out
in
the
former
lesson
and
then
the
teacher
may
proceed
thus
you
have
told
me
that
this
little
creature
is
called
a
spider
and
some
of
you
think
it
very
ugly
and
say
you
are
afraid
of
it
but
sensible
children
will
not
be
frightened
at
a
spider
because
they
will
remember
that
they
are
very
harmless
little
things
and
have
not
got
a
sting
as
the
wasp
and
bee
have
they
are
very
ugly
to
be
sure
but
every
ugly
insect
is
not
to
be
called
a
nasty
creature
for
some
are
very
useful
notwithstanding
their
not
being
as
handsome
as
others
and
spiders
are
very
useful
too
although
very
few
people
know
how
to
make
use
of
them
but
they
little
think
that
the
poor
little
insect
which
they
brush
off
the
wall
and
trample
under
their
feet
can
tell
them
what
weather
they
are
going
to
have
as
sure
and
surer
than
a
when
the
weather
is
going
to
be
fine
it
peeps
its
head
out
of
its
hole
and
stretches
out
its
legs
and
the
farther
its
legs
and
head
are
out
the
longer
will
the
fine
weather
stay
when
the
weather
is
going
to
be
very
bad
it
goes
farther
back
and
when
very
dreadful
and
stormy
weather
is
going
to
come
it
turns
its
back
to
the
door
of
its
hole
and
its
head
inside
in
winter
when
frost
and
snow
is
going
to
commence
they
make
their
webs
very
fast
and
by
this
you
may
know
the
frosty
weather
is
coming
so
you
see
children
that
spiders
may
be
useful
to
know
what
kind
of
weather
we
shall
have
spiders
are
very
cunning
they
live
on
flies
but
they
could
never
catch
them
only
they
are
able
to
weave
a
strong
web
which
they
do
in
a
place
where
the
flies
often
come
and
when
a
poor
fly
gets
into
the
web
the
spider
runs
out
and
soon
kills
it
and
then
drags
it
up
to
his
den
where
he
eats
it
at
his
ease
and
hides
the
wings
and
skin
that
the
other
flies
may
not
see
them
but
if
an
enemy
stronger
than
itself
comes
to
his
web
the
spider
remains
in
his
hole
till
the
danger
is
all
over
some
spiders
that
live
in
countries
far
away
are
a
great
deal
larger
and
uglier
than
our
spiders
but
we
need
not
be
ever
afraid
of
a
spider
because
they
can
neither
bite
nor
sting
us
and
are
very
curious
insects
q
what
have
i
been
telling
you
about
a
the
spider
q
are
you
afraid
of
it
a
no
you
told
us
it
would
do
us
no
harm
q
are
spiders
very
ugly
a
they
are
q
should
we
think
badly
of
them
for
this
a
no
q
who
made
the
spider
a
god
q
does
he
not
make
every
animal
whether
handsome
or
ugly
a
yes
q
can
spiders
be
of
use
a
they
will
tell
us
what
weather
we
are
going
to
have
q
when
it
is
going
to
be
fine
what
do
they
do
a
they
put
their
legs
and
head
out
of
their
hole
q
when
it
is
going
to
be
bad
weather
what
do
they
do
a
they
turn
their
heads
round
and
go
into
their
holes
q
when
the
weather
is
going
to
be
very
cold
and
frosty
what
do
they
do
a
they
build
their
webs
very
fast
q
what
do
they
live
upon
a
flies
q
how
do
they
catch
them
a
by
making
webs
q
when
a
fly
gets
into
their
web
what
do
they
do
a
they
kill
it
and
eat
it
q
are
the
spiders
in
other
countries
larger
than
ours
a
yes
in
some
places
they
are
much
larger
and
uglier
q
who
teaches
the
spider
to
make
its
web
a
god
q
could
any
man
in
the
world
make
a
spider
web
a
no
no
one
could
do
it
the
teacher
may
then
add
thus
thus
you
see
little
children
that
every
living
thing
has
some
merit
of
its
own
and
can
do
many
things
which
we
can
not
do
although
god
has
given
us
the
means
to
become
so
much
wiser
than
they
and
be
sure
you
are
not
frightened
at
them
nor
put
them
to
unnecessary
pain
some
other
day
i
will
tell
you
what
is
the
shape
of
the
spider
web
and
shew
you
what
a
number
of
regular
figures
the
spider
web
is
composed
of
almost
every
object
however
simple
it
may
be
will
form
an
instructive
gallery
lesson
thus
for
example
you
may
take
a
piece
of
and
after
submitting
it
to
the
inspection
of
the
infants
you
may
inquire
what
is
this
if
it
be
in
a
country
where
turf
is
used
a
general
exclamation
will
inform
you
of
its
name
if
not
you
may
find
a
better
and
more
familiar
object
for
your
lesson
when
you
have
got
the
name
you
may
then
ask
its
uses
and
will
soon
find
that
the
children
are
well
acquainted
with
them
you
may
then
proceed
to
give
your
own
information
on
the
subject
in
something
like
the
following
words
taking
care
that
you
use
no
word
that
the
children
do
not
themselves
understand
or
that
you
have
not
explained
to
them
little
children
look
at
what
i
hold
you
have
told
me
it
is
a
piece
of
and
it
is
used
to
make
fires
in
ireland
turf
is
more
used
to
make
fires
than
coal
because
it
is
very
plentiful
there
and
many
of
the
poor
people
in
ireland
build
their
houses
of
it
and
when
they
keep
them
well
mended
and
covered
they
are
very
warm
and
comfortable
and
they
burn
good
turf
fires
in
their
turf
houses
but
some
of
them
are
lazy
and
do
not
keep
their
turf
houses
mended
so
the
rain
comes
in
and
they
are
very
miserable
and
so
will
all
idle
lazy
people
be
i
hope
no
little
child
here
will
be
lazy
now
i
will
tell
you
where
they
get
all
this
turf
they
dig
it
out
of
the
bogs
there
are
bogs
in
england
they
call
them
mosses
or
fens
and
in
scotland
there
are
bogs
but
the
bogs
in
ireland
are
much
more
plentiful
some
of
them
are
so
very
large
that
you
can
not
see
across
them
and
a
great
many
birds
live
amongst
them
such
as
wild
ducks
and
geese
and
cranes
and
herons
and
snipe
all
of
which
i
will
tell
you
about
some
other
time
those
great
bogs
are
very
wild
lonesome
dreary
places
no
person
can
live
on
them
because
they
are
so
wet
and
soft
and
they
are
full
of
great
deep
holes
with
water
in
them
which
are
called
bog
holes
and
if
any
person
fell
in
they
would
be
drowned
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
this
great
bog
you
will
see
a
pretty
green
island
where
the
land
is
firm
and
strong
and
the
grass
is
nice
and
sweet
so
that
the
poor
people
make
a
dry
path
across
the
wet
bog
to
these
islands
that
they
may
drive
their
cows
and
goats
and
horses
to
feed
there
and
some
of
these
islands
are
very
pretty
places
and
look
so
green
in
the
centre
of
the
black
bog
those
bogs
which
are
now
such
wet
black
nasty
places
were
once
forests
of
great
trees
as
large
as
any
you
children
ever
saw
and
pretty
bright
rivers
ran
through
those
forests
and
nice
birds
sang
in
the
branches
and
great
stags
eat
the
grass
underneath
we
will
read
about
the
stag
at
some
other
time
this
was
many
hundred
years
ago
and
there
were
very
few
people
living
then
in
ireland
and
by
degrees
when
the
trees
got
very
old
they
began
to
fall
down
into
the
rivers
and
stopped
them
up
so
that
the
water
could
not
flow
on
and
the
rivers
overflowed
all
the
nice
forests
and
the
trees
all
fell
so
that
when
some
hundred
years
passed
they
were
all
down
and
the
branches
rotted
and
the
grass
and
clay
became
wet
like
sponge
and
the
whole
of
the
nice
shady
forests
of
great
trees
became
what
we
call
bogs
and
the
remains
of
those
pretty
branches
and
leaves
where
the
birds
used
to
sing
so
sweetly
has
become
turf
like
this
piece
which
we
have
for
a
lesson
and
when
men
are
cutting
this
turf
out
they
often
find
the
great
trunks
of
those
trees
that
many
hundred
years
ago
were
so
green
and
beautiful
quite
black
and
ugly
but
still
so
hard
that
they
can
scarcely
be
cut
and
these
old
trees
are
called
and
the
buys
them
and
makes
them
into
beautiful
chairs
and
tables
and
presses
and
many
other
things
and
they
are
quite
black
and
when
polished
you
little
children
might
see
your
faces
in
them
thus
you
see
my
little
children
that
there
is
nothing
which
god
has
made
which
is
not
very
wonderful
and
curious
even
this
piece
of
which
you
would
not
have
heard
about
if
you
did
not
come
to
the
infant
school
to
learn
about
so
many
useful
and
curious
things
this
will
perhaps
be
enough
of
information
for
one
lesson
and
having
thus
infused
it
in
an
agreeable
form
into
their
minds
you
may
proceed
in
the
manner
before
mentioned
to
get
it
back
from
them
in
order
to
impress
it
more
firmly
on
their
understandings
and
if
this
be
always
done
in
the
proper
manner
they
will
become
as
familiar
with
the
subject
and
learn
it
as
quickly
as
they
would
the
tissue
of
nonsense
contained
in
the
common
nursery
tales
of
jack
and
jill
or
the
old
woman
and
her
silver
penny
whose
only
usefulness
consists
in
their
ability
to
amuse
but
from
which
no
instruction
can
be
possibly
drawn
beside
which
they
form
in
the
child
mind
the
germ
of
that
passion
for
light
reading
which
afterwards
in
many
instances
prevents
an
application
to
any
thing
solid
or
instructive
being
in
themselves
the
foundation
stone
on
which
a
huge
and
useless
mass
of
fiction
is
piled
in
after
years
the
philosophical
mind
will
at
once
perceive
the
advantage
of
our
system
of
amusement
mingled
with
instruction
and
perceive
that
upon
its
simple
basis
a
noble
structure
may
be
afterwards
raised
and
minds
well
stored
with
useful
lore
and
capable
of
discerning
evil
in
whatever
shape
it
presents
itself
and
extracting
honey
from
every
object
will
be
farmed
which
when
they
become
numerous
will
cause
a
glorious
change
in
the
moral
world
the
first
germ
of
which
will
be
traced
to
the
properly
managed
gallery
lessons
of
an
infant
school
having
asked
the
children
if
they
are
tired
the
teacher
if
he
receives
an
answer
in
the
negative
may
thus
proceed
q
what
have
we
been
hearing
about
a
turf
q
what
is
the
use
of
turf
a
to
make
fires
q
what
other
use
is
sometimes
made
of
it
a
to
build
houses
q
where
do
they
build
turf
houses
a
in
ireland
q
are
they
not
very
cold
q
no
if
they
are
kept
mended
they
are
not
q
what
do
you
call
people
when
they
like
to
sleep
in
the
cold
rather
than
mend
their
houses
lazy
q
is
it
bad
to
be
lazy
a
yes
very
bad
q
what
do
we
call
it
besides
being
lazy
q
being
idle
q
are
idle
people
very
happy
a
no
they
are
always
miserable
q
right
and
i
hope
no
little
children
will
be
ever
idle
they
should
always
try
to
be
useful
and
do
all
they
can
to
help
their
friends
now
tell
me
where
is
the
turf
got
from
a
from
bogs
q
what
are
they
called
in
england
mosses
and
fens
q
are
the
bogs
in
england
larger
than
in
ireland
a
no
the
irish
bogs
are
the
largest
q
what
animals
live
in
the
bogs
a
some
sorts
of
birds
q
do
men
and
women
live
in
them
a
no
q
why
not
a
they
are
too
wet
and
soft
q
what
very
dangerous
places
are
in
some
parts
of
them
q
what
are
they
a
deep
holes
full
of
water
q
what
did
i
tell
you
were
in
some
parts
of
these
bogs
a
nice
green
islands
q
are
they
of
any
use
a
yes
the
people
put
cows
and
horses
to
feed
on
them
q
how

is
this
called

do
they
do
next

put
it
in
heaps
to
dry
q
what
were
those
great
bogs
many
hundred
years
ago
a
beautiful
forests

fine
large
trees

flowed
through
those
forests
a
nice
bright
rivers
q

pretty
birds

grass

fine
large
stags

q
how
did
those
beautiful
places
become
ugly
black
wet
bogs
a
the
trees
when
they
got
old
fell
into
the
rivers
and
stopped
them
up
q
what
did
this
cause
a
the
water
flowed
over
the
banks
q
what
harm
did
this
do
a
it
made
all
the
nice
grass
wet
and
marshy
q
what
more
a
it
rotted
the
roots
of
the
trees
q
what
happened
then
a
they
all
fell
down
q
in
some
hundred
years
what
did
all
those
forests
become
a
great
bogs
q
are
any
of
the
trunks
or
bodies
of
those
old
trees
ever
found
a
yes
many
hundreds
are
yet
far
under
the
bogs
q
are
they
of
any
use
a
yes
they
are
useful
to
make
chairs
tables
and
presses
q
what
colour
are
they
a
as
black
as
a
piece
of
coal
q
when
they
are
polished
do
they
look
nice
a
yes
so
bright
you
can
see
your
face
in
them
q
what
is
this
wood
called
q
will
you
all
try
to
remember
this
lesson
a
we
will
teacher
that
is
right
for
little
children
should
always
remember
the
pretty
things
that
their
teacher
takes
such
trouble
to
tell
them
in
places
where
coal
is
most
burned
a
piece
of
it
may
be
made
the
medium
of
a
very
useful
and
instructive
lesson
being
so
familiar
an
object
their
attention
will
be
arrested
by
its
being
made
the
subject
of
a
lesson
and
their
curiosity
aroused
to
know
every
thing
about
it
when
the
teacher
asks
what
is
this
the
simultaneous
shout
of
a
piece
of
coal
will
convince
him
that
he
has
arrested
their
attention
and
a
few
questions
will
exhaust
their
stock
of
information
on
the
subject
they
will
tell
him
its
uses
are
to
make
fires
to
boil
up
their
dinners
he
may
then
proceed
as
follows
you
see
little
children
this
piece
of
coal
look
at
it
attentively
it
is
black
and
shining
and
you
all
know
will
burn
very
quickly
the
places
from
whence
all
coal
is
brought
are
called
the
men
who
dig
it
out
of
the
ground
and
the
ships
that
carry
it
over
the
sea
are
called
colliers
and
the
place
where
the
coals
are
got
is
called
a
colliery
the
coal
mines
are
deep
holes
made
very
far
under
the
ground
in
order
to
get
at
the
coal
some
of
them
go
under
the
sea
the
colliers
live
a
great
part
of
their
life
in
those
dark
holes
in
order
to
get
us
coal
to
make
us
fires
to
dress
our
food
and
very
often
are
killed
either
by
the
falling
in
of
the
roof
from
above
or
from
a
sort
of
air
called
which
if
touched
with
any
fire
will
blow
up
like
gunpowder
and
will
kill
any
person
that
is
near
it
the
poor
colliers
are
also
often
smothered
by
the
bad
air
that
is
in
those
damp
dark
holes
so
you
see
little
children
what
dangers
they
go
through
in
order
to
get
us
coal
which
we
could
very
badly
do
without
how
very
good
god
is
to
us
he
made
this
coal
under
the
earth
that
we
might
have
nice
fires
to
dress
our
food
and
warm
ourselves
by
in
cold
weather
we
should
be
very
thankful
to
him
for
all
his
great
blessings
and
should
never
do
anything
to
make
him
angry
with
us
he
is
very
sorry
when
he
sees
a
little
child
naughty
because
he
has
done
every
thing
to
make
us
happy
and
we
never
can
be
so
if
we
are
naughty
and
bad
bad
boys
and
girls
are
never
happy
and
god
does
not
love
them
when
they
are
so
and
it
is
very
sad
to
make
god
angry
with
us
coal
is
very
useful
for
other
things
besides
making
fires
to
dress
our
food
and
to
warm
us
many
things
that
are
very
useful
could
not
be
made
without
it
the
gas
that
lights
the
streets
is
made
from
coal
and
when
the
gas
is
taken
from
it
what
is
left
is
called
coke
which
makes
a
very
bright
warm
fire
the
teacher
that
properly
enters
into
the
spirit
of
these
lessons
may
find
in
the
simplest
objects
a
source
of
pleasure
and
instruction
for
his
infant
pupils
no
person
who
is
not
qualified
to
give
proper
and
really
useful
gallery
lessons
is
by
any
means
fit
for
a
teacher
of
infants
to
learn
the
mere
routine
of
an
infant
school
is
not
very
difficult
but
this
will
be
of
no
avail
if
the
teacher
have
not
qualifications
of
a
much
higher
order
which
will
enable
him
continually
to
pour
instruction
clothed
in
simple
language
into
the
minds
of
his
pupils
simplicity
is
the
life
and
soul
of
gallery
teaching
without
this
the
breath
is
wasted
and
time
is
spent
in
vain
to
teach
infants
we
must
reduce
our
language
to
their
tender
capacities
and
become
in
idea
and
words
one
of
themselves
having
given
the
children
your
information
on
a
piece
of
coal
you
now
proceed
to
get
it
back
as
follows
q
little
children
what
have
we
been
speaking
about
a
about
coal
q
what
colour
is
it
a
black
q
is
it
anything
besides
a
yes
shining
q
what
are
the
places
called
from
whence
coal
is
got
q
what
are
the
men
that
dig
it
out
of
the
ground
and
the
ships
that
carry
it
over
the
sea
called
colliers
q
what
is
the
place
called
where
the
coal
pits
are
made
a
a
colliery
q
what
are
coal
pits
a
deep
holes
dug
to
get
at
the
coal
q
are
the
colliers
in
danger
down
in
these
deep
pits
a
they
are
q
from
what
a
from
q
what
is
it
a
a
sort
of
air
that
blows
up
like
q
from
what
more
are
they
in
danger
a
the
roofs
falling
in
q
from
what
more
a
from
bad
air
which
often
smothers
them
q
what
is
made
from
coal
to
light
the
streets
a
gas
q
what
is
coal
called
after
the
gas
has
been
taken
from
it
coke
q
does
coke
make
a
good
fire
a
yes
very
bright
and
strong
q
who
made
the
coal
a
god
q
what
should
we
be
to
him
for
it
a
very
thankful
q
how
can
we
shew
we
are
thankful
a
by
being
very
good
q
is
god
glad
to
see
a
child
naughty
a
no
he
is
very
sorry
q
does
he
love
naughty
children
a
no
he
does
not
q
are
naughty
children
happy
a
no
very
unhappy
thus
every
lesson
may
be
made
not
only
a
vehicle
for
conveying
instruction
but
also
of
instilling
into
the
infant
mind
a
reverence
a
sense
of
gratitude
and
love
towards
that
great
being
who
called
us
all
into
existence
this
should
be
never
lost
sight
of
in
giving
the
child
those
primary
sentiments
reverence
and
gratitude
towards
its
god
you
lay
a
basis
on
which
doctrinal
religion
may
be
afterwards
built
with
more
advantage
the
child
thus
early
trained
in
such
feelings
conveyed
in
a
manner
so
admirably
adapted
to
its
tender
mind
can
scarcely
fail
unless
it
possesses
a
heart
of
great
natural
depravity
of
becoming
a
good
man
and
it
is
thus
that
infant
schools
may
become
a
great
and
lasting
blessing
to
the
country
but
where
this
is
overlooked
where
the
vital
principle
of
the
infant
system
is
rejected
and
the
mere
mechanical
parts
alone
retained
as
to
any
great
and
lasting
benefit
it
will
be
a
complete
and
unhappy
failure
that
the
grand
object
of
the
infant
system
may
be
accomplished
namely
of
raising
up
a
generation
superior
to
the
last
both
in
religious
moral
and
intellectual
acquirements
an
immense
caution
and
great
experience
in
the
selection
of
teachers
is
required
till
proper
teachers
are
universally
provided
the
infant
system
will
never
be
really
successful
success
does
not
merely
consist
in
universal
adoption
and
extension
if
it
did
it
would
be
now
really
so
but
another
thing
is
wanting
before
it
can
be
called
successful
that
is
it
must
be
understood
none
can
understand
it
but
thinkers
and
deep
thinkers
and
thinkers
in
the
right
direction
merely
to
glance
around
and
gather
scraps
of
knowledge
from
the
various
ologies
in
existence
which
the
march
of
intellect
has
brought
into
being
and
which
were
unknown
to
our
forefathers
and
then
to
force
them
on
the
young
memory
at
random
may
be
to
teach
what
was
not
before
taught
but
it
is
not
to
display
any
method
of
teaching
any
more
efficient
way
of
communicating
those
who
would
truly
understand
the
infant
system
must
think
for
themselves
and
observe
the
workings
of
the
young
mind
mark
the
intellectual
principles
which
first
develope
themselves
strive
to
understand
the
simple
laws
of
mental
action
and
all
this
that
they
may
know
how
to
teach
in
accordance
with
them
when
this
is
fairly
done
perhaps
the
whole
that
is
recorded
in
this
book
may
be
thought
more
valuable
than
it
is
at
present
and
be
found
a
not
unworthy
subject
to
devote
a
whole
life
to
become
acquainted
with
and
elucidate
both
practically
and
theoretically
others
then
will
perhaps
not
be
quite
so
audacious
in
unjust
plagiarisms
when
columbus
had
made
the
egg
stand
on
an
end
all
others
could
then
do
it
when
he
had
discovered
america
every
one
said
they
might
have
done
it
also
all
great
and
important
truths
are
simple
and
when
presented
to
the
mind
although
unknown
before
seem
as
if
they
had
been
well
known
there
is
such
an
accurate
consistency
between
the
mind
and
them
this
leads
me
to
suppose
that
there
is
simple
and
useful
truths
in
my
volumes
as
every
one
seems
to
take
them
for
their
own
i
can
only
say
that
they
have
cost
many
and
many
an
hour
of
close
observation
and
deep
and
independent
thinking
i
have
devoted
my
whole
life
for
the
good
of
others
and
have
injured
myself
and
family
that
i
might
do
so
to
rescue
little
children
from
vice
and
misery
and
to
have
them
placed
under
physical
intellectual
moral
and
religious
discipline
has
been
the
delight
of
my
heart
and
the
object
of
my
life
after
this
labour
to
have
my
inventions
pirated
my
plans
made
use
of
in
part
and
in
the
rest
spoken
against
to
have
others
to
reap
the
fields
that
i
have
sown
and
at
the
same
time
traduce
and
injure
me
to
be
thus
thrust
out
as
it
were
from
my
rightful
employment
and
left
in
comparative
obscurity
as
old
age
begins
to
draw
on
requires
a
spirit
stronger
than
that
of
man
and
a
heart
more
than
human
not
to
feel
it
and
feel
it
deeply
i
care
little
for
myself
but
regret
most
to
see
spurious
systems
of
infant
education
palmed
upon
the
public
by
ignorant
persons
and
thus
deprive
them
of
a
great
benefit
which
they
might
possess
facts
recorded
in
scripture
may
be
given
orally
as
gallery
lessons
taking
care
to
exhibit
some
picture
representing
the
subject
proposed
for
the
lesson
take
for
example
the
finding
of
moses
which
represents
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
coming
down
to
bathe
with
her
maidens
and
also
the
infant
moses
in
the
ark
cradle
or
boat
which
was
made
for
the
purpose
the
subject
is
then
to
be
propounded
to
the
children
as
follows
and
the
teacher
is
to
take
care
to
repeat
it
clearly
and
distinctly
in
short
sentences
and
to
be
careful
that
all
the
pupils
repeat
it
as
distinctly
after
him
by
thus
means
the
essence
of
the
story
is
infused
into
the
minds
of
the
children
with
the
addition
of
their
being
taught
to
repeat
all
the
words
distinctly
and
properly
which
will
assist
their
pronunciation
very
much
when
they
begin
to
read
the
lesson
described
in
another
part
of
this
work
and
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
came
down
to
wash
herself
at
the
river
and
her
maidens
walked
along
by
the
river
side
and
when
she
saw
the
ark
among
the
flags
she
sent
her
maid
to
fetch
it
and
when
she
had
opened
it
she
saw
the
child
and
behold
the
babe
wept
and
she
had
compassion
on
him
and
said
this
is

of
the
hebrews

said
his
sister
to

i
go
and
call
to
thee
a
nurse
of
the
hebrew
women
that
she
may
nurse
the
child
for
thee
and
pharaoh
daughter
said
to
her
go
and
the
maid
went
and
called
the
child
mother
and
pharaoh
daughter
said
unto
her
take
this
child
away
and
nurse
it
for
me
and
i
will
give
thee
thy
wages
and
the
woman
took
the
child
and
nursed
it
and
the
child
grew
and
she
brought
hum
unto
pharaoh
daughter
and
he
became
her
son

she
called
his
name

and
made
to
work
for
nothing
and
against
his
wills
christ
with
the
doctors
in
the
temple
forms
when
given
as
explained
a
good
gallery
lesson
thus
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
those
days
she
found
him
in
the
temple
sitting
in
the
midst
of
the
doctors
both
hearing
them
and
asking
them
questions
and
all
that
heard
him
were
astonished
at
his
understanding
and
answers
and
when
they
saw
him
they
were
amazed
and
his
mother
said
unto
him
son
why
hast
thou
thus
dealt
with
us
behold
thy
father
and
i
have
sought
thee
sorrowing
and
he
said
unto
them
how
is
it
that
ye
sought
me
wist
ye
not
that
i
must
be
about
my
business
and
they
understood
not
the
saying
which
he
spake
unto
them
and
he
went
down
with
them
and
came
to
nazareth
and
was
subject
unto
them
but
his
mother
kept
all
these
sayings
in
and
jesus
increased
in
wisdom
and
stature
and
in
favour
with
god
and
man
ii
q
where
did
they
find
him

in
the
temple

sitting
in
the
midst
of

the
doctors

were
astonished
at

what
did
jesus
increase

wisdom
and
stature
q
what
do
you
mean
by
increasing
in
stature
a
growing
larger
many
books
of
scripture
stories
have
been
written
for
children
but
it
is
far
best
to
select
simple
and
suitable
passages
from
the
sacred
volume
and
have
them
properly
illustrated
by
coloured
plates
by
this
method
the
children
become
acquainted
with
the
very
letter
of
scripture
written
stories
often
leave
very
wrong
impressions
and
the
history
of
david
and
goliah
has
been
given
in
an
infant
school
so
that
it
would
make
an
excellent
counterpart
to
jack
the
giant
killer
surely
such
things
ought
never
to
be
abundance
of
historical
portions
full
of
moral
and
religious
instruction
and
such
as
are
calculated
from
their
simplicity
and
beauty
to
deeply
impress
the
minds
of
children
can
be
selected
from
both
testaments
but
the
miracles
and
parables
of
our
saviour
constitute
the
richest
store
moral
training
one
of
the
grand
aims
of
the
infant
system
was
intended
to
improve
the
system
of
moral
training
the
great
deficiency
in
our
systems
of
education
with
respect
to
moral
training
is
truly
lamentable
from
the
highest
down
to
the
lowest
schools
in
the
land
there
is
room
for
immense
improvement
in
this
matter
it
is
hardly
possible
to
visit
a
school
and
witness
proper
efforts
made
on
this
important
subject
and
never
will
education
produce
the
glorious
effects
anticipated
from
it
until
this
subject
is
legislated
for
and
well
understood
by
the
public
and
i
pray
to
god
that
he
will
enable
me
to
use
arguments
in
this
chapter
to
prove
effective
in
the
minds
of
my
readers
so
as
to
induce
them
to
with
me
to
produce
another
state
of
things
in
these
days
there
is
much
said
about
education
it
has
at
last
arrested
the
attention
of
parliament
and
through
them
the
government
and
as
it
should
be
through
the
government
the
sovereign
thus
is
truly
encouraging
and
will
act
as
a
stimulus
to
practical
men
to
develop
a
system
workable
in
all
its
parts
and
thus
carry
out
the
views
and
benevolent
intentions
of
the
legislature
infant
education
however
must
be
the
basis
this
is
beginning
at
the
right
end
if
errors
are
committed
here
the
superstructure
is
of
little
avail
the
foundation
of
moral
training
must
be
laid
in
infancy
it
can
not
be
begun
too
soon
and
is
almost
always
commenced
too
late
mere
infants
can
understand
the
doing
as
they
would
be
done
by
no
child
likes
to
be
deprived
of
its
his
little
toys
or
any
thing
which
he
considers
his
property
he
will
always
punish
the
aggressor
if
he
can
and
if
he
can
not
he
will
cry
or
put
himself
in
a
passion
or
seek
aid
from
his
parents
or
any
other
source
where
he
thinks
he
may
get
justice
done
to
him
little
children
have
beautiful
ideas
on
this
subject
and
would
have
if
properly
trained
correct
notions
as
to
the
rights
of
property
to
teach
them
to
respect
the
property
of
others
and
even
to
respect
themselves
is
far
preferable
to
cramming
their
memories
with
good
rules
in
theory
this
was
the
old
plan
we
have
proof
that
it
has
not
worked
well
the
new
plan
must
operate
upon
the
will
it
must
influence
the
heart
of
the
child
this
is
the
scripture
plan
which
continually
refers
to
the
heart
and
not
so
much
to
the
head
every
opportunity
must
be
allowed
the
child
to
develop
its
character
to
do
this
it
must
be
associated
with
its
fellows
if
the
child
is
a
solitary
being
his
faculties
can
not
be
drawn
out
it
is
in
society
only
they
can
be
beneficially
acted
upon
and
it
is
in
the
company
of
its
fellows
that
it
will
shew
its
true
character
and
disposition
hence
the
necessity
of
moral
training
there
should
be
temptations
placed
within
reach
of
the
children
such
as
fruits
flowers
and
shrubs
the
child
taught
to
respect
these
will
set
due
bounds
to
his
desire
gardens
will
cease
to
be
robbed
hedges
will
not
be
broken
down
turnips
and
potatoes
will
not
be
stolen
to
the
extent
which
is
but
too
prevalent
in
the
present
day
and
i
am
perfectly
convinced
that
every
pound
the
country
spends
in
promoting
a
rightly
directed
education
will
be
saved
in
the
punishment
of
crime
which
in
a
political
point
of
view
is
quite
sufficient
to
induce
the
country
to
call
for
a
properly
directed
system
of
national
education
which
must
ultimately
be
based
on
the
oracles
of
eternal
truth
if
these
ends
could
be
obtained
by
theory
we
have
plenty
of
that
in
these
days
all
the
writers
on
education
tell
us
that
such
and
such
things
should
be
done
but
most
of
them
that
i
have
read
forget
to
tell
us
how
to
do
it
they
complain
of
the
schools
already
in
existence
they
complain
of
the
teachers
they
complain
of
the
apathy
upon
the
subject
all
of
which
is
very
easy
and
i
regret
to
say
there
is
but
too
much
cause
for
all
these
complaints
but
this
will
not
remedy
the
evil
we
must
have
new
plans
for
moral
training
teachers
must
have
greater
encouragements
held
out
to
them
they
must
take
their
proper
rank
in
society
which
i
contend
is
next
to
the
clergy
and
until
these
things
take
place
we
may
go
on
complaining
as
talented
men
will
sooner
devote
themselves
to
any
profession
rather
than
to
the
art
of
teaching
we
will
now
endeavour
to
show
how
these
things
are
to
be
remedied
so
far
as
moral
training
is
applicable
to
infants
from
twelve
months
old
to
six
or
seven
years
in
another
part
of
this
work
we
have
shewn
what
may
and
ought
to
be
done
in
the
in
this
chapter
we
will
endeavour
to
shew
what
may
be
done
to
this
end
in
the
in
the
pages
on
gallery
teaching
we
have
given
specimens
of
lessons
on
natural
objects
and
scriptural
subjects
moral
training
may
receive
considerable
aid
from
gallery
teaching
also
the
children
must
not
only
be
continually
told
what
they
ought
to
do
but
as
often
what
they
ought
not
to
do
they
must
be
told
that
they
are
not
to
fight
and
the
reasons
must
be
given
they
must
be
told
that
they
are
not
to
throw
stones
and
also
told
the
consequences
they
must
be
told
not
to
strike
each
other
with
sticks
they
must
be
told
not
to
play
in
the
dirt
they
must
be
trained
in
cleanly
and
delicate
habits
they
must
not
only
be
told
all
these
things
but
they
must
be
watched
in
their
private
hours
they
must
be
encouraged
to
assist
and
love
each
other
and
it
must
to
them
that
this
is
the
way
to
advance
their
own
individual
happiness
it
is
that
is
the
cause
of
half
our
miseries
children
can
not
be
told
this
too
soon
it
must
be
explained
to
them
that
evil
sooner
or
latter
brings
its
own
punishment
and
that
goodness
as
assuredly
brings
its
own
reward
opportunities
will
be
continually
developing
themselves
for
giving
moral
training
to
the
children
the
judicious
teacher
will
seize
these
as
they
occur
and
always
make
the
best
of
them
for
the
good
of
the
children
a
school
is
a
family
upon
a
large
scale
nay
is
a
commonwealth
and
no
day
will
pass
without
facts
shewing
themselves
to
enable
the
teacher
to
give
sound
moral
instruction
it
is
true
we
want
a
better
race
of
teachers
but
we
must
have
a
better
sort
of
schools
first
for
it
is
only
from
these
that
a
better
race
of
teachers
can
be
supplied
the
well
trained
infants
of
this
generation
will
make
the
efficient
teachers
of
the
next
we
will
suppose
the
children
to
be
seated
in
the
gallery
the
doors
of
the
school
closed
and
every
thing
snug
and
quiet
teacher
must
be
and
there
must
be
nothing
to
distract
the
attention
he
must
then
bring
out
his
store
of
facts
which
he
has
noted
down
as
they
occurred
he
makes
his
selection
according
to
circumstances
according
to
the
state
of
his
own
mind
not
forgetting
the
state
of
mind
that
the
children
may
be
in
and
especially
the
state
of
the
weather
the
following
little
ditty
may
then
be
repeated
the
subject
being
on
cruelty
to
animals
i
never
hurt
my
little
dog
but
stroke
and
pat
his
head
i
love
to
see
him
wag
his
tail
i
like
to
see
him
fed
poor
little
thing
how
very
good
and
very
useful
too
and
do
you
know
that
he
will
mind
what
he
is
bid
to
do
then
i
will
never
hurt
my
dog
nor
ever
give
him
pain
but
i
will
always
treat
him
kind
and
he
will
love
again
if
the
children
do
not
appear
so
bright
as
the
teacher
should
desire
the
ditty
after
it
has
been
repeated
may
be
sung
but
the
tune
must
be
such
as
would
be
likely
to
operate
upon
the
moral
feelings
great
caution
and
circumspection
is
necessary
in
selecting
proper
times
for
children
and
this
must
be
guided
by
the
subject
treated
of
if
the
subject
is
exhilarating
a
lively
tune
must
be
selected
if
the
subject
is
serious
a
corresponding
tune
must
also
be
chosen
but
if
the
subject
is
intended
to
operate
upon
the
feelings
what
is
usually
called
love
will
be
the
most
desirable
the
tune
having
been
sung
and
the
feelings
operated
upon
as
desired
the
teacher
may
entertain
the
little
pupils
with
some
one
of
the
numerous
stories
written
about
the
dog
but
before
he
does
this
he
must
exhaust
so
much
of
the
subject
as
appears
in
the
ditty
by
question
and
answer
similar
to
the
other
lessons
mentioned
before
something
like
the
following
little
children
you
have
just
sung
that
you
would
never
hurt
a
little
dog
can
you
tell
me
why
not
some
of
the
children
will
be
sure
to
say
please
sir
because
he
has
got
the
sense
of
feeling
teacher
right
a
little
dog
has
got
the
same
sense
of
feeling
as
you
little
children
have
and
when
it
is
hurt
how
does
it
shew
that
it
has
got
the
sense
of
feeling
children
please
sir
it
will
cry
out
teacher
yes
it
can
only
tell
us
it
is
hurt
by
doing
so
a
poor
dog
can
not
speak
and
so
we
should
never
hurt
it
has
a
little
fly
the
sense
of
feeling
children
yes
sir
teacher
right
again
and
so
has
every
creature
that
god
gave
life
to
and
we
should
never
give
any
of
them
unnecessary
pain
in
the
song
that
we
have
just
sung
you
said
you
would
stroke
and
pat
the
little
dog
head
what
would
you
do
this
for
children
please
sir
the
little
dog
likes
it
and
he
is
not
afraid
of
us
when
we
do
it
but
loves
us
teacher
so
he
does
and
will
always
love
those
that
are
kind
to
him
no
one
but
a
very
bad
boy
would
be
unkind
to
a
dog
you
told
me
little
children
that
a
poor
little
dog
cries
out
when
it
is
hurt
now
when
he
is
pleased
what
does
he
do
please
sir
he
wags
his
tail
and
his
eyes
look
very
bright
teacher
so
he
does
which
is
the
same
as
if
he
said
how
happy
i
am
to
be
with
such
good
children
who
do
not
beat
me
as
some
wicked
boys
and
girls
would
but
love
me
and
pat
my
head
and
feed
me
for
you
little
children
you
have
said
you
liked
to
see
your
little
dog
fed
and
remember
any
of
you
that
have
a
little
dog
or
who
may
have
one
when
you
get
older
and
larger
that
it
is
very
cruel
not
to
see
it
fed
every
day
the
poor
dog
can
not
ask
for
its
dinner
as
a
little
child
can
and
that
is
the
very
reason
why
we
should
always
remember
to
give
it
to
him
will
you
all
remember
this
children
yes
sir
we
will
teacher
you
sung
in
your
song
that
the
dog
was
very
useful
tell
me
how
children
please
sir
he
will
mind
the
house
and
bark
when
any
one
comes
to
steal
anything
teacher
yes
you
see
how
sensible
the
little
dog
is
he
knows
what
a
wicked
thing
it
is
to
be
a
thief
and
so
he
barks
when
he
sees
one
how
else
is
a
little
dog
useful
children
please
sir
they
often
lead
poor
blind
people
about
teacher
so
they
do
and
good
faithful
guides
they
are
when
they
see
any
danger
they
will
lead
their
master
out
of
it
and
they
will
bring
him
safely
through
the
crowded
streets
and
when
they
go
home
the
poor
blind
man
divides
his
bit
of
bread
with
his
good
dog
and
dogs
are
useful
in
other
ways
they
catch
hares
and
rabbits
for
their
masters
and
do
many
other
things
you
said
also
that
the
dog
minded
what
he
was
bid
to
do
did
you
not
children
yes
sir
and
they
will
often
go
back
a
long
way
for
any
thing
they
are
bid
or
stay
all
day
minding
their
master
coat
while
he
is
at
work
teacher
right
and
little
children
when
they
will
not
do
as
they
are
desired
are
not
so
good
as
a
little
dog
and
should
take
example
by
one
do
you
remember
what
you
said
the
dog
would
do
if
you
treated
him
kindly
children
please
sir
that
he
would
love
us
again
teacher
right
when
we
love
any
thing
a
dog
or
a
horse
or
a
little
lamb
it
will
love
us
again
for
you
know
little
children
that
love
makes
love
and
if
you
all
love
one
another
and
are
kind
to
one
another
and
never
beat
or
strike
each
other
with
any
thing
then
you
will
all
be
very
happy
no
little
children
in
the
world
will
be
more
happy
or
have
prettier
smiling
faces
than
you
will
have
for
when
we
look
kind
and
pleasant
we
always
look
pretty
but
when
we
look
cross
and
angry
then
we
look
ugly
and
frightful
remember
then
never
be
cruel
to
a
dog
or
any
thing
else
but
think
of
this
lesson
and
the
pretty
song
we
sung
now
little
children
shall
i
tell
you
a
story
a
real
true
story
about
a
very
cruel
boy
if
the
children
say
yes
the
following
may
be
related
a
poor
little
dog
was
once
going
along
the
streets
of
a
town
and
a
carriage
which
was
coming
up
the
street
very
fast
ran
over
it
and
the
poor
thing
was
very
nearly
killed
but
it
had
still
strength
to
crawl
over
to
a
house
where
a
boy
was
standing
at
the
door
and
it
began
to
whine
and
looked
up
in
the
boy
face
as
if
to
say
you
see
how
much
i
am
hurt
so
please
take
me
in
and
try
and
cure
me
but
the
boy
was
a
very
cruel
boy
and
had
no
pity
on
the
poor
dog
but
took
a
large
pot
of
boiling
water
and
threw
it
over
the
poor
wounded
little
dog
so
that
it
died
soon
after
in
very
dreadful
pain
but
the
chief
governor
of
the
place
that
is
the
person
whom
the
king
had
put
there
to
punish
wicked
people
heard
of
what
a
cruel
thing
this
bad
boy
had
done
so
he
brought
him
up
to
the
market
place
and
he
made
a
man
take
off
this
cruel
boy
clothes
and
lash
him
on
the
bare
back
before
all
the
people
of
the
town
in
order
that
he
might
know
a
little
of
the
pain
that
the
poor
dog
had
felt
from
this
story
little
children
you
may
learn
that
you
must
not
begin
to
be
cruel
if
you
do
the
habit
will
grow
up
with
you
as
it
did
with
this
bigger
boy
and
will
never
leave
you
even
when
you
are
men
such
lessons
as
these
given
at
proper
times
and
when
the
infant
mind
is
in
a
fit
state
to
receive
them
will
do
more
to
prevent
what
you
wish
to
avoid
than
any
thing
which
could
be
possibly
done
at
a
more
advanced
age
this
is
indeed
moral
training
and
when
such
is
given
generally
in
infant
schools
we
may
look
forward
to
a
generation
very
superior
to
the
present
in
the
genuine
parts
of
christianity
and
in
every
moral
and
social
virtue
the
beneficial
results
of
moral
training
have
been
practically
shown
in
every
infant
school
where
the
subject
has
been
properly
understood
and
carried
out
and
numerous
anecdotes
illustrative
of
its
beneficial
effects
might
be
here
introduced
which
would
convince
those
who
have
any
doubt
on
the
subject
of
the
good
effects
of
exercising
kindness
and
consideration
for
others
in
opposition
to
reckless
mischief
hardheartedness
and
cruelty
vices
which
render
the
lower
orders
dangerous
and
formidable
but
as
a
complete
collection
of
such
anecdotes
would
form
in
themselves
a
volume
we
will
for
the
present
lay
before
our
readers
a
few
taken
at
random
to
illustrate
the
subject
they
are
from
the
appendix
of
the
first
report
of
the
edinburgh
infant
school
society
the
model
school
of
which
was
organized
by
the
author
of
this
book
two
of
the
children
brothers
about
five
and
four
years
of
age
coming
one
morning
late
into
school
were
to
go
to
their
seats
without
censure
if
they
could
give
an
account
of
what
they
had
been
doing
which
should
be
declared
satisfactory
by
the
whole
school
who
should
decide
they
stated
separately
that
they
had
been
contemplating
the
proceedings
of
a
large
caterpillar
and
noticing
the
different
positions
of
its
body
as
it
crossed
their
path
that
it
was
now
horizontal
and
now
perpendicular
and
presently
curved
and
finally
inclined
when
it
escaped
into
a
tree
the
master
then
asked
them
abruptly
why
did
you
not
kill
it
the
children
stared
you
have
killed
it
asked
the
teacher
yes
but
that
would
have
been
cruel
and
naughty
and
a
sin
against
god
the
little
moralists
were
acquitted
by
acclamation
having
infants
as
they
were
manifested
a
character
which
were
it
universal
in
the
juvenile
population
would
in
another
generation
reduce
our
moral
code
to
a
mass
of
waste
paper
in
one
grand
department
of
its
bulk
this
anecdote
illustrates
the
good
effect
of
inculcating
into
the
infant
mind
an
abhorrence
of
cruelty
to
animals
which
is
too
often
a
seed
sown
in
the
young
heart
which
goes
on
increasing
daily
with
the
growth
of
the
child
until
a
fearful
career
of
crime
is
ended
by
murder
and
its
necessary
expiation
on
the
scaffold
how
many
men
who
have
suffered
death
for
murder
could
date
their
first
steps
towards
it
from
the
time
when
in
infancy
they
tortured
a
fly
or
spun
a
the
teacher
mentioned
to
the
children
one
day
that
he
had
been
occupied
about
a
boy
and
a
girl
who
had
no
father
or
mother
and
whose
grandfather
and
grandmother
who
took
care
of
them
were
and
in
great
poverty
the
boy
was
seven
years
of
age
too
old
for
the
infant
school
but
some
gentlemen
he
said
were
exerting
themselves
to
get
the
boy
into
one
of
the
hospitals
here
he
purposely
stopped
to
try
the
sympathies
of
his
audience
for
the
girl
he
was
not
disappointed
several
little
voices
called
out
at
once
master
what
for
no
the
lassie
too
he
assured
them
the
girl
was
to
come
to
the
infant
school
and
to
be
boarded
there
which
intelligence
was
received
with
loud
plaudits
here
we
see
the
seeds
of
philanthropy
sown
in
the
young
mind
beginning
even
in
infancy
to
burst
and
blossom
forth
giving
promise
in
after
years
of
a
glorious
and
abundant
harvest
the
germ
of
love
and
mercy
is
in
every
breast
and
can
not
fail
to
be
developed
if
early
called
into
action
and
by
the
blessing
of
almighty
god
who
is
the
great
first
cause
of
all
good
results
the
day
is
fast
approaching
yea
is
now
at
hand
when
the
fierce
passions
the
love
of
self
the
long
catalogues
of
debasing
crimes
which
have
so
long
disgraced
human
nature
will
give
way
before
a
golden
age
of
true
christianity
when
man
will
not
be
arrayed
against
his
but
all
will
go
hand
in
hand
together
in
the
bond
of
love
seeking
to
do
good
and
to
accomplish
the
purposes
for
which
they
were
created
by
an
and
god
the
following
anecdote
illustrates
the
subject
still
further
one
day
when
the
children
were
in
the
four
boys
occupied
the
boys
circular
swing
while
a
stranger
gentleman
was
looking
on
with
the
teacher
conscious
of
being
looked
at
the
little
fellows
were
wheeling
round
with
more
than
usual
swiftness
and
dexterity
when
a
little
creature
of
two
or
three
years
made
a
sudden
dart
forward
into
their
very
orbit
and
in
an
instant
must
have
been
knocked
down
with
great
force
with
a
presence
of
mind
and
consideration
and
with
a
mechanical
skill
which
to
admire
most
we
knew
not
one
of
the
boys
about
five
years
old
used
the
instant
of
time
in
which
the
singular
movement
was
practicable
threw
his
whole
body
into
a
horizontal
position
and
went
clear
over
the
head
but
this
was
not
all
in
the
same
well
employed
instant
it
occurred
to
him
that
that
movement
was
not
enough
to
save
the
little
intruder
as
he
himself
was
to
be
followed
as
quick
as
thought
by
the
next
swinger
for
this
he
provided
by
dropping
his
own
feet
to
the
ground
and
stopping
the
whole
machine
the
instant
he
had
cleared
the
child
head
the
spectator
of
this
admirable
specimen
of
intellect
and
good
feeling
which
was
all
necessarily
the
thought
and
act
of
a
moment
had
his
hand
instinctively
in
his
pocket
for
a
shilling
but
was
stopped
by
the
teacher
who
disowns
all
inferior
motives
for
acts
of
kindness
and
justice
the
little
hero
however
had
his
reward
for
the
incident
was
related
by
the
teacher
in
a
full
school
in
the
presence
of
the
strangers
and
was
received
with
several
rounds
of
hearty
applause
we
will
quote
another
anecdote
illustrative
of
the
good
effects
of
exercising
the
kindly
feelings
accused
of
having
eaten
up
dinner
it
was
proved
by
several
witnesses
that
not
only
appropriated
the
dinner
but
used
force
the
charge
being
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
the
whole
school
the
same
tribunal
were
requested
by
the
teacher
to
decide
what
should
be
the
consequence
to
the
convict
one
orator
rose
and
suggested
that
as
had
not
yet
eat
his
own
dinner
he
ought
to
give
it
to
this
motion
for
the
children
always
welcome
any
reasonable
substitute
for
corporal
punishment
was
carried
by
acclamation
when
one
came
and
the
dinner
was
handed
over
to
was
observed
by
him
to
be
in
tears
and
lingering
near
his
dinner
they
were
by
this
time
nearly
done
but
the
teacher
was
watching
the
result
the
tears
were
too
much
for
who
went
to
threw
his
arms
round
his
neck
told
him
not
to
cry
but
to
sit
down
and
take
half
this
invitation
was
of
course
accepted
by
who
manifested
a
great
inferiority
of
character
to
the
other
and
furnished
an
example
of
the
blindness
of
the
unjust
to
the
justice
of
retribution
which
they
always
feel
to
mere
revenge
and
cruelty
he
could
not
bear
to
see
even
sharing
dinner
and
told
him
with
bitterness
that
he
would
tell
his
mother
weel
weel
said
the
generous
child
i
gin
y
back
again
of
course
the
teacher
interfered
to
prevent
this
gross
injustice
and
in
the
afternoon
made
their
perfectly
aware
of
the
part
each
had
acted
it
is
not
easy
to
render
a
character
like
liberal
but
a
long
course
of
such
practice
for
precept
is
impotent
in
such
cases
might
modify
what
in
after
life
would
have
turned
out
a
selfish
unjust
and
unsocial
character
this
selfish
principle
it
is
the
great
object
of
moral
training
to
combat
against
we
may
trace
almost
all
the
misery
in
the
world
to
it
and
until
it
ceases
to
exist
to
the
extent
which
it
now
does
little
can
be
done
to
accomplish
any
good
or
great
purpose
but
lessons
like
the
above
and
received
into
the
infant
mind
when
in
a
receptive
state
will
if
proper
advantage
be
taken
of
their
occurrence
prove
in
the
hands
of
the
almighty
a
powerful
engine
for
the
removal
of
selfishness
and
we
know
of
no
method
so
effectual
to
accomplish
this
object
as
the
drawing
infants
into
societies
which
is
done
only
in
infant
schools
the
following
anecdote
bearing
on
the
same
subject
came
under
the
observation
of
the
author
of
this
work
very
early
in
his
labour
for
the
extension
of
his
system
he
gives
it
here
in
the
same
words
as
he
communicated
it
to
a
friend
at
the
time
of
its
occurrence
a
few
days
since
i
went
to
the
boston
street
school
the
children
were
in
the
gallery
and
the
moment
i
entered
they
rose
to
receive
me
when
the
school
was
over
the
children
came
around
me
as
they
usually
do
saying
when
will
you
come
again
and
so
on
i
told
them
i
could
not
tell
but
that
i
would
come
as
soon
as
i
could
this
answer
would
not
satisfy
them
and
i
talked
to
them
until
near
six
in
the
evening
one
little
girl
about
four
years
old
kept
looking
stedfastly
at
me
the
whole
time
not
letting
a
single
word
or
gesture
escape
her
notice
at
last
i
finished
my
observations
and
desired
the
children
to
go
the
infant
in
question
immediately
took
hold
of
my
hand
and
said
we
shall
never
see
you
any
more
you
must
come
home
with
me
i
replied
what
do
you
want
me
to
go
home
for
the
child
answered
i
have
nothing
to
give
you
but
if
you
will
come
home
mother
will
give
you
some
tea
i
patted
the
child
on
the
head
telling
it
i
could
not
go
the
child
went
home
as
i
thought
and
i
remained
some
time
talking
to
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
committee
on
walking
down
the
street
i
saw
the
same
child
crying
bitterly
and
surrounded
by
many
other
children
on
inquiring
the
cause
i
received
for
answer
would
not
come
home
to
if
only
one
half
the
invitations
that
are
given
amongst
were
given
with
as
much
sincerity
and
disinterestedness
as
was
manifested
by
this
i
am
much
mistaken
if
we
should
not
see
a
very
different
state
of
moral
education
writes
simpson
in
his
philosophy
of
education
embraces
both
the
animal
and
moral
impulses
it
regulates
the
former
and
strengthens
the
latter
whenever
gluttony
indelicacy
violence
cruelty
greediness
cowardice
pride
insolence
vanity
or
any
mode
of
selfishness
shew
themselves
in
the
individual
under
training
one
and
all
must
be
repressed
with
the
most
watchful
solicitude
and
the
most
skilful
treatment
repression
may
at
first
fail
to
be
accomplished
unless
by
severity
but
the
instructor
sufficiently
enlightened
in
the
faculties
will
in
the
first
practicable
moment
drop
the
coercive
system
and
awaken
and
appeal
powerfully
to
the
higher
faculties
of
conscience
and
benevolence
and
to
the
powers
of
reflection
this
done
with
kindness
in
other
words
with
a
marked
manifestation
of
benevolence
itself
will
operate
with
a
power
the
extent
of
which
in
education
is
yet
to
a
very
limited
extent
estimated
in
the
very
exercise
of
the
superior
faculties
the
inferior
are
indirectly
acquiring
a
habit
of
restraint
and
regulation
for
it
is
morally
impossible
to
cultivate
the
superior
faculties
without
a
simultaneous
though
indirect
regulation
of
the
inferior
it
is
indeed
a
melancholy
truth
that
moral
training
is
yet
to
a
very
limited
extent
estimated
and
this
is
mainly
owing
to
its
not
being
understood
by
the
generality
of
those
selected
for
the
office
of
teachers
of
infants
nor
can
it
be
expected
that
persons
of
sufficient
intellect
and
talent
to
comprehend
and
carry
out
this
great
object
can
be
procured
until
a
sufficient
remuneration
is
held
out
to
them
to
make
it
worth
their
while
to
devote
their
whole
energies
to
the
subject
it
is
a
fatal
error
to
suppose
that
mere
girls
taken
perhaps
from
some
laborious
occupation
and
whose
sum
total
of
education
consists
of
reading
and
writing
can
carry
out
views
which
it
requires
a
philosophical
mind
well
stored
with
liberal
ideas
and
general
knowledge
to
effect
they
may
be
able
to
instruct
the
children
in
the
mere
mechanical
part
of
the
system
and
as
long
as
they
confine
themselves
to
this
they
will
go
on
capitally
but
no
further
than
this
can
they
go
and
though
the
children
may
appear
to
a
casual
visitor
to
be
very
nicely
instructed
and
very
wonderful
little
creatures
on
a
closer
examination
they
will
be
found
mere
automatons
and
then
without
a
thought
on
the
subject
the
system
will
be
blamed
without
once
considering
that
the
most
perfect
figure
of
mechanism
will
not
work
properly
in
any
hands
except
those
that
thoroughly
understand
it
enough
may
have
now
been
said
on
this
subject
and
my
earnest
prayer
is
that
by
god
help
these
remarks
may
produce
beneficial
results
and
if
my
endeavours
to
make
the
subject
of
moral
instruction
more
easily
understood
and
to
demonstrate
its
importance
as
clearly
as
possible
are
successful
the
results
will
soon
shew
me
that
the
hard
labour
of
years
has
not
been
entirely
in
vain
and
this
will
be
to
me
a
greater
reward
than
all
the
praise
distinction
and
honour
that
it
is
in
man
power
to
confer
whenever
an
infant
is
detected
in
any
of
those
animal
impulses
to
regulate
which
is
the
great
end
of
moral
training
a
gallery
lesson
should
be
immediately
given
having
a
tendency
to
excite
an
abhorrence
of
the
fault
on
the
minds
of
all
the
children
an
opportunity
of
this
description
should
never
be
let
pass
these
are
the
very
best
times
to
implant
virtuous
and
moral
sentiments
in
the
minds
of
the
young
pupils
these
are
the
golden
opportunities
of
bringing
into
action
the
higher
faculties
of
conscience
and
benevolence
and
the
powers
of
reflection
if
an
instance
of
the
too
prevalent
cruelty
of
the
young
to
animals
be
detected
which
often
occurs
from
mere
thoughtlessness
it
may
be
prevented
from
again
occurring
by
a
few
lessons
like
the
one
which
we
have
given
as
a
specimen
the
same
means
may
be
taken
for
crushing
the
rudiments
of
gluttony
violence
pride
deceit
or
any
other
vice
the
gallery
is
the
proper
place
for
these
lessons
and
after
the
matter
has
been
thoroughly
in
the
or
wherever
else
it
has
occurred
the
children
should
then
be
marched
to
the
gallery
to
receive
a
proper
instruction
on
the
subject
cruelty
on
the
part
of
boys
is
too
prevalent
it
is
energy
enterprise
and
high
animal
spirit
not
legislated
for
on
the
part
of
parents
and
teachers
which
descends
to
cruelty
first
to
animals
then
to
all
which
has
life
that
can
not
defend
itself
children
soon
learn
to
distinguish
those
children
and
animals
who
can
and
will
resent
cruelty
from
those
who
will
not
and
therefore
speculate
on
the
results
accordingly
and
become
up
to
this
point
a
child
should
never
be
without
a
kind
and
wise
guide
at
this
period
that
which
in
itself
descends
to
evil
for
the
want
of
a
moral
guide
may
be
turned
to
good
the
faculties
mentioned
can
not
be
extinguished
but
can
be
regulated
this
is
the
office
of
the
teacher
too
frequently
we
try
to
crush
the
powers
that
early
want
training
and
regulating
the
same
powers
which
run
to
vice
may
be
trained
to
virtue
but
the
activities
can
not
and
ought
not
to
be
kept
too
much
in
abeyance
children
are
not
naturally
cruel
although
they
differ
much
in
the
propensity
to
annoy
and
reduce
animals
and
each
other
under
their
individual
control
the
passive
submit
at
once
but
the
energetic
will
not
it
is
then
that
the
active
assailant
learns
an
important
lesson
which
can
only
be
learned
in
society
and
which
to
him
is
of
great
importance
the
difficulty
on
the
part
of
the
teacher
is
to
know
when
to
interfere
and
when
to
let
alone
i
have
often
erred
by
interference
of
this
i
am
quite
satisfied
the
anxiety
to
prevent
evil
has
caused
me
to
interfere
too
soon
by
not
giving
time
to
the
pupil
fully
to
develops
his
act
i
hope
others
will
profit
from
this
it
requires
much
practice
and
long
study
of
different
temperaments
in
children
to
know
when
to
let
alone
and
when
to
interfere
but
certain
it
is
that
the
moral
faculties
can
and
must
be
developed
in
any
system
worthy
of
the
name
of
education
other
vices
beside
cruelty
are
to
be
found
in
children
moral
training
applies
to
these
and
none
are
left
to
run
their
own
course
why
should
they
what
are
schools
for
but
to
form
the
virtuous
character
the
being
who
can
command
self
control
the
orderly
character
the
good
citizen
and
the
being
who
fears
and
loves
god
ends
less
than
these
can
not
be
worthy
of
the
efforts
of
the
philanthropist
and
the
truly
religious
man
there
is
another
idea
which
has
long
been
in
my
mind
and
which
i
hope
some
day
to
see
carried
into
practice
a
religious
service
adapted
for
children
in
our
various
places
of
worship
no
accurate
observer
of
the
young
in
churches
during
divine
service
can
have
failed
to
witness
the
inattention
of
the
numbers
of
children
who
are
assembled
on
such
occasions
the
service
is
too
long
and
inappropriate
for
them
as
is
also
the
sermon
it
is
addressed
to
adults
and
sometimes
the
terms
used
by
the
preacher
is
greek
to
half
the
adults
in
agricultural
districts
men
can
not
be
too
simple
with
the
young
and
illiterate
there
is
much
room
for
improvement
in
these
things
and
with
regard
to
the
young
i
can
answer
for
them
that
if
they
are
addressed
in
proper
language
which
they
can
understand
and
are
supplied
with
proper
religious
food
for
the
understanding
suitable
to
its
state
of
receptivity
and
if
i
may
say
digestive
powers
they
as
a
body
will
shew
us
an
example
which
will
surprise
many
with
regard
to
the
church
there
might
be
taken
from
the
prayer
book
a
simple
service
adapted
to
the
purpose
i
am
certain
i
could
do
it
with
ease
as
i
know
what
is
adapted
for
children
or
at
least
i
ought
to
do
the
next
point
all
the
preachers
should
be
men
of
peculiar
temperament
and
great
simplicity
of
manner
i
do
not
care
how
learned
they
are
the
more
learned
the
better
but
it
need
not
be
in
languages
but
in
spiritual
things
there
are
thousands
of
passages
in
the
holy
word
which
are
adapted
and
i
think
intended
for
the
purpose
and
there
are
many
men
now
living
who
are
able
to
do
the
thing
and
more
will
be
raised
up
one
thing
however
must
not
be
forgotten
they
must
be
in
life
not
to
teach
natural
things
properly
to
children
requires
more
knowledge
than
the
generality
of
the
public
suppose
the
younger
the
children
are
the
more
knowledge
it
requires
on
the
part
of
the
instructor
but
to
teach
spiritual
things
properly
to
children
men
can
not
know
too
much
provided
they
have
the
power
to
simplify
that
knowledge
and
reduce
it
to
practice
an
evening
service
will
not
do
for
children
it
must
be
either
in
the
morning
or
the
middle
of
the
day
so
fully
am
i
impressed
with
the
importance
of
this
idea
that
i
am
determined
shortly
to
take
means
to
carry
it
out

and

of

for

and
punishments
badge
of
distinction
not
how
does
the
deity
deal
with
his
creatures
on
this
momentous
question
this
is
the
question
which
every
thinker
and
every
religious
man
must
ask
himself
and
then
act
accordingly
as
man
comes
into
the
world
with
a
propensity
to
do
that
which
is
forbidden
it
has
been
found
necessary
at
all
times
to
enact
laws
to
govern
and
even
to
punish
him
when
he
acts
contrary
to
them
and
who
will
deny
the
man
a
just
reward
who
has
done
any
act
whereby
his
have
been
benefitted
the
hope
of
reward
sweetens
labour
if
then
rewards
and
punishments
are
necessary
to
make
active
and
to
keep
them
in
order
how
can
it
be
expected
that
children
can
be
governed
without
some
kind
of
punishment
i
am
aware
that
i
am
taking
the
unpopular
side
of
the
question
by
becoming
an
advocate
for
punishment
but
notwithstanding
this
i
must
say
that
i
think
no
school
in
england
has
ever
been
governed
without
it
and
that
the
many
theories
ushered
into
the
world
on
this
subject
have
not
been
exactly
acted
upon
and
since
this
was
written
i
am
in
a
position
to
state
the
same
with
regard
to
both
scotland
and
ireland
indeed
it
appears
to
me
that
while
men
continue
to
be
imperfect
beings
it
is
not
possible
that
either
they
or
their
offspring
can
be
governed
without
some
degree
of
punishment
i
admit
that
it
should
be
administered
with
great
prudence
and
never
employed
but
as
a
last
resource
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
it
has
descended
to
brutality
in
some
schools
which
perhaps
is
one
reason
why
so
many
persons
set
their
faces
against
it
altogether
i
might
write
as
others
have
done
by
stating
that
i
had
brought
up
a
family
of
my
own
without
ever
having
struck
even
once
any
of
my
children
but
then
this
is
no
argument
for
the
general
conducting
of
a
school
in
school
children
are
spoiled
before
they
come
to
you
in
a
family
the
judicious
parent
begins
at
the
beginning
the
cases
therefore
entirely
differ
the
first
thing
that
appears
to
me
necessary
is
to
find
out
if
possible
the
real
disposition
and
temper
of
a
child
in
order
to
be
able
to
manage
it
with
good
effect
i
will
allow
that
it
is
possible
to
govern
some
children
without
corporal
punishment
for
i
have
had
some
under
my
charge
whom
i
never
had
occasion
to
punish
to
whom
a
word
was
quite
sufficient
and
who
if
i
only
looked
displeased
would
burst
into
tears
but
i
have
had
others
quite
the
reverse
you
might
talk
to
them
till
you
were
tired
and
it
would
produce
no
more
effect
half
an
hour
afterwards
than
if
they
had
not
been
spoken
to
at
all
indeed
children
dispositions
are
as
various
as
their
faces
no
two
are
alike
consequently
what
will
do
for
one
child
will
not
do
for
another
and
hence
the
impropriety
of
having
an
invariable
mode
of
punishment
what
should
we
think
of
a
medical
man
who
was
to
prescribe
for
every
constitution
in
the
same
manner
the
first
thing
a
skilful
physician
does
is
to
ascertain
the
constitution
of
the
patient
and
then
he
prescribes
accordingly
and
nothing
is
more
necessary
for
those
who
have
charge
of
little
children
than
to
ascertain
their
real
character
raving
done
this
they
will
be
able
should
a
child
offend
to
apply
some
appropriate
antidote
to
begin
with
rewards
to
the
monitors
i
have
generally
allowed
one
penny
a
week
each
as
i
found
much
difficulty
in
procuring
monitors
for
whatever
honours
were
attached
to
the
office
children
of
five
years
old
could
not
exactly
comprehend
them
they
could
much
more
easily
perceive
the
use
of
a
penny
and
as
a
proof
how
much
they
valued
the
penny
a
week
above
all
the
honours
that
could
be
bestowed
i
always
had
a
good
supply
of
monitors
after
this
remuneration
was
adopted
before
this
time
they
used
to
say
please
sir
may
i
sit
down
i
do
not
like
to
be
a
monitor
perhaps
i
might
prevail
on
some
to
hold
the
office
a
little
longer
by
explaining
to
them
what
an
honourable
office
it
was
but
after
all
i
found
that
the
penny
a
week
spoke
more
powerfully
than
i
did
and
the
children
would
say
to
each
other
i
like
to
be
a
monitor
now
for
i
had
a
penny
last
saturday
and
master
says
we
are
to
have
a
penny
every
week
do
you
wish
you
were
a
monitor
yes
i
do
and
master
says
if
i
am
a
good
boy
i
shall
be
a
monitor
by
and
bye
and
then
i
shall
have
a
penny
i
think
they
richly
deserve
it
some
kind
of
reward
i
consider
necessary
but
what
kind
of
reward
must
of
course
rest
entirely
with
the
promoters
of
the
different
schools
a
footnote
a
in
many
of
the
infant
schools
i
hull
visited
i
found
the
spelling
and
reading
very
much
neglected
that
neither
the
monitors
nor
children
look
at
the
lessons
but
merely
say
them
by
rote
if
the
monitors
are
punished
for
inattention
they
wish
to
give
up
the
office
because
there
is
no
reward
attached
to
it
but
if
there
is
a
reward
attached
to
it
of
any
kind
the
children
have
sense
enough
to
see
that
the
thing
is
fairly
balanced
for
if
they
are
rewarded
for
doing
their
duty
they
see
no
injustice
in
being
punished
for
neglecting
it
perhaps
nothing
would
tend
more
to
the
order
and
efficient
conducting
of
an
infant
school
than
the
plan
of
giving
rewards
to
the
monitors
from
the
part
they
take
in
teaching
and
superintending
others
it
seems
due
to
them
for
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
hire
if
we
are
to
make
use
of
monitors
at
all
i
am
now
convinced
that
they
be
rewarded
parents
do
not
like
their
children
to
work
for
nothing
and
when
they
become
useful
they
are
taken
away
entirely
unless
rewarded
the
training
system
uses
monitors
only
in
that
which
is
purely
mechanical
or
to
infuse
into
the
external
memory
that
which
is
to
be
learned
by
rote
singly
or
simultaneously
by
the
pupils
such
as
chapters
out
of
the
scriptures
catechisms
creeds
poetry
psalms
hymns
prayers
and
commandments
and
whatever
is
as
it
is
called
to
be
learned
by
heart
but
to
develope
the
faculties
of
the
pupils
to
really
teach
religion
morals
intellectuals
or
anything
which
applies
to
the
interior
of
the
pupils
they
are
useless
a
most
important
means
of
discipline
appears
in
what
we
term
trial
by
jury
which
is
composed
of
all
the
children
in
the
school
it
has
been
already
stated
that
the
is
the
scene
for
the
full
development
of
character
and
consequently
the
spot
where
circumstances
occur
which
demand
this
peculiar
treatment
it
should
also
be
particularly
observed
that
it
is
next
to
prayer
in
solemnity
and
should
only
be
adopted
on
extraordinary
occasions
any
levity
manifested
either
by
the
teacher
or
the
pupils
will
be
fatal
to
the
effect
but
to
illustrate
it
i
will
state
a
fact
in
the
of
an
infant
school
there
was
an
early
dwarf
which
from
its
situation
had
fruit
while
other
trees
had
only
flowers
it
became
therefore
an
object
of
general
attention
and
ordinarily
called
forth
a
variety
of
important
observations
now
it
happened
that
two
children
one
five
years
of
age
and
the
other
not
quite
three
entered
the
school
in
the
autumn
and
on
the
return
of
spring
they
having
had
only
a
winter
training
were
charmed
by
this
object
and
in
consequence
fell
into
temptation
accustomed
to
watch
new
scholars
narrowly
i
particularly
observed
them
when
i
marked
the
elder
one
anxiously
intently
and
wishfully
gazing
on
the
fruit
and
especially
on
one
amazingly
large
cherry
pendent
from
a
single
shoot
while
thus
absorbed
the
younger
child
was
attracted
to
the
spot
and
imitated
his
example
the
former
then
asked
if
he
did
not
think
it
a
large
one
and
the
reply
was
of
course
in
the
affirmative
having
thus
addressed
the
powers
of
observation
the
next
appeal
was
to
the
taste
by
the
inquiry
is
not
it
a
nice
one
the
answer
to
which
was
yes
then
followed
the
observation
it
is
quite
soft
when
the
young
one
being
thus
excited
by
the
touch
of
the
other
touched
it
also
this
act
he
subsequently
repeated
by
desire
of
the
elder
who
having
charged
him
to
hold
it
tight
struck
his
hand
and
thus
detached
the
cherry
i
now
withdrew
to
some
distance
and
it
was
evident
that
the
little
one
was
distressed
by
what
he
had
done
as
he
did
not
eat
it
but
began
to
cry
faintly
on
which
the
elder
took
the
cherry
out
of
his
hand
and
ate
it
this
increased
the
crying
when
on
approaching
he
ran
up
to
me
saying
that
the
other
took
my
cherry
the
little
one
continuing
to
cry
the
other
stated
that
he
saw
him
take
it
to
which
i
replied
we
will
try
him
by
and
bye
as
soon
therefore
as
the
proper
time
arrived
the
bell
was
rung
prior
to
which
however
i
was
apprised
of
the
loss
by
several
children
and
when
all
were
seated
in
the
gallery
i
proceeded
as
follows
now
little
children
i
want
you
to
use
all
your
faculties
to
look
at
me
attentively
and
to
think
of
what
i
am
about
to
say
for
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
tale
of
two
little
boys
once
on
a
time
they
were
amusing
themselves
with
a
great
many
other
children
in
a
where
there
was
a
great
many
flowers
and
some
fruit
trees
but
before
i
go
on
let
me
ask
you
is
it
right
to
take
the
flowers
or
fruit
which
belong
to
others
to
which
the
general
reply
was
no
with
the
exception
of
the
culprits
i
then
described
their
age
stated
that
one
boy
was
five
years
old
and
the
other
three
that
the
former
was
looking
at
one
of
his
master
fine
cherries
which
was
growing
against
the
wall
and
that
the
latter
approached
and
looked
at
it
too
on
which
several
exclaimed
please
sir
your
big
cherry
is
gone
which
caused
an
inspection
of
each
others
countenances
to
this
i
replied
i
am
sorry
for
it
but
let
me
finish
my
tale
now
children
while
they
were
both
looking
at
the
cherry
the
older
one
asked
the
younger
if
it
were
not
large
to
which
he
replied
he
then
inquired
whether
it
were
not
nice
when
he
again
answered
afterwards
be
told
him
having
touched
it
himself
first
to
touch
it
because
it
was
soft
and
the
little
boy
unfortunately
did
so
on
which
the
big
one
pulled
his
arm
and
the
cherry
came
off
in
his
hand
while
this
was
proceeding
the
two
delinquents
sat
very
demurely
conscious
that
they
were
pourtrayed
though
all
the
rest
were
ignorant
of
the
fact
i
then
said
which
do
you
think
the
worst
of
these
boys
when
several
answered
the
biggest
was
the
worst
on
inquiring
why
the
reply
was
because
he
told
the
little
one
to
take
it
while
others
said
because
he
pulled
his
arm
i
added
i
have
not
told
you
the
whole
tale
yet
but
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
know
right
from
wrong
and
presently
you
will
be
still
better
prepared
to
judge
when
the
big
boy
had
told
the
little
one
to
take
the
cherry
he
then
robbed
him
of
it
and
immediately
betrayed
him
by
telling
the
master
now
which
do
you
think
was
the
worst
when
a
great
number
of
voices
vociferated
the
big
one
i
then
inquired
if
they
thought
we
had
such
children
in
our
school
the
general
reply
was
but
the
scrutiny
among
themselves
was
redoubled
to
this
i
rejoined
i
am
sorry
to
say
such
children
are
now
sitting
among
you
in
the
gallery
at
this
crisis
the
little
one
burst
into
tears
on
which
the
children
said
please
sir
one
of
them
for
his
face
is
so
red
and
he
cries
i
answered
i
am
sorry
it
is
so
and
called
the
culprit
down
with
come
here
my
dear
and
sit
by
the
side
of
me
until
we
examine
into
it
this
was
followed
by
the
outcry
please
sir
we
have
found
the
other
he
hangs
his
head
down
and
his
face
looks
so
white
this
child
was
then
called
down
in
the
same
mild
manner
to
sit
on
the
other
side
of
me
i
then
told
them
that
they
would
find
when
they
became
men
and
women
that
in
our
courts
of
law
witnesses
of
what
was
done
were
called
and
as
the
elder
boy
had
seen
the
young
one
take
the
cherry
it
was
necessary
and
desireable
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
on
being
desired
to
stand
up
i
therefore
said
did
you
see
him
take
the
cherry
to
which
he
promptly
replied
yes
the
next
inquiry
was
what
did
he
do
with
it
to
this
he
was
silent
on
which
the
little
one
not
being
able
to
contain
himself
called
out
he
took
it
from
me
and
ate
it
all
eyes
were
now
turned
to
the
big
one
and
all
felt
convinced
that
he
was
the
most
guilty
whilst
the
confidence
of
the
little
one
increased
by
the
prospect
of
having
justice
done
him
as
he
previously
feared
that
being
accused
by
the
elder
one
he
should
be
condemned
without
ceremony
finding
that
the
elder
one
had
no
more
to
say
it
only
remained
to
hear
the
defence
of
the
young
one
who
sensible
of
having
done
what
was
wrong
said
in
broken
accents
he
told
me
to
take
it
he
hit
my
hand
and
he
ate
the
cherry
to
which
it
was
necessary
to
give
the
admonition
that
he
never
ought
to
do
wrong
though
required
to
do
so
by
others
and
that
such
a
defence
would
avail
him
nothing
were
he
a
man
both
the
children
were
now
exceedingly
distressed
and
hence
this
was
the
time
to
appeal
to
the
rest
as
to
the
measure
of
the
punishment
that
was
due
the
general
opinion
was
that
the
eldest
should
be
punished
but
no
one
mentioned
that
the
young
one
should
even
have
a
pat
on
the
hand
the
next
thing
was
to
appeal
to
the
higher
faculties
of
the
little
culprit
who
seeing
that
he
had
thus
far
got
off
required
to
be
softened
down
in
reference
to
the
other
though
he
had
betrayed
him
while
the
best
way
of
operating
on
the
elder
was
a
display
of
love
on
the
part
of
the
younger
he
was
therefore
asked
if
he
would
forgive
the
other
and
shake
hands
with
him
which
he
immediately
did
to
the
evident
delight
and
satisfaction
of
all
the
children
while
the
countenance
of
the
elder
showed
that
he
felt
himself
unworthy
of
the
treatment
he
received
i
then
inflicted
the
sentence
which
had
been
pronounced
two
pats
of
the
hand
which
the
girls
asked
might
be
soft
ones
and
sent
him
to
his
seat
while
i
concluded
the
whole
with
some
appropriate
exhortations
it
is
pleasing
to
add
that
the
elder
proved
one
of
the
most
useful
monitors
i
ever
had
a
footnote
a
this
mode
of
treatment
has
succeeded
in
a
number
of
instances
several
writers
on
education
have
tried
it
and
have
found
it
work
well
it
is
one
of
the
most
effective
methods
to
operate
upon
the
minds
of
young
children
that
i
have
been
able
to
discover
i
have
tried
the
plan
with
older
children
with
great
success
reader
can
teachers
who
are
mere
boys
and
girls
act
thus
in
such
a
case
should
any
person
be
disposed
to
object
to
such
a
process
they
may
be
reminded
that
the
infant
system
deals
with
children
as
rational
creatures
and
is
designed
to
prepare
them
for
future
life
i
have
seen
numerous
instances
of
its
beneficial
effects
these
have
induced
me
to
pursue
the
plan
and
in
the
strongest
terms
to
recommend
it
to
others
in
all
cases
the
matter
should
be
stated
to
the
children
simply
calmly
and
slowly
and
they
will
seldom
if
ever
come
to
a
wrong
conclusion
a
manual
trade
or
a
business
which
requires
dexterity
can
never
be
learnt
from
books
alone
or
properly
understood
from
mere
precepts
all
must
be
acquired
by
practice
and
then
the
knowledge
of
it
becomes
as
it
were
a
part
of
our
very
selves
the
same
applies
to
the
precepts
of
morality
if
they
be
merely
committed
to
memory
by
rote
they
will
often
lie
there
cold
and
inactive
and
not
unfrequently
tend
even
to
harden
the
feelings
but
when
they
are
brought
out
into
actual
practice
and
made
to
bear
upon
the
conscience
of
the
culprit
and
on
the
moral
feelings
of
all
the
children
through
him
they
are
seen
in
a
new
and
convincing
light
and
learnt
with
a
power
that
will
impress
them
indelibly
on
the
memory
nathan
said
unto
david
thou
art
the
man
the
most
effectual
teaching
of
a
christian
parent
is
not
at
the
time
of
the
mere
infusion
of
moral
truth
into
a
child
mind
but
in
the
example
he
gives
in
his
life
and
the
direction
he
gives
according
to
it
to
his
child
when
he
walks
by
the
way
and
when
he
sits
in
the
house
such
should
be
the
teaching
aimed
at
in
every
infant
school
how
wise
are
the
dealings
of
the
creator
with
us
on
the
subject
of
reward
what
being
ever
yet
did
good
who
did
not
feel
within
a
certain
reward
who
felt
most
of
the
influence
of
the
holy
spirit
the
passers
by
or
the
good
samaritan
nay
who
felt
the
greatest
reward
in
his
own
breast
the
samaritan
himself
or
the
man
who
fell
amongst
thieves
i
think
the
samaritan
throughout
all
creation
we
see
rewards
for
assiduity
the
early
crow
gets
the
worms
the
cautious
animal
escapes
his
enemies
the
good
man
enjoys
the
most
happiness
out
of
goodness
happiness
can
not
be
found
virtue
brings
its
own
reward
obedience
to
the
natural
laws
does
the
same
so
does
obedience
to
the
spiritual
laws
bring
such
rewards
as
my
pen
can
not
describe
but
i
doubt
not
many
have
felt
them
the
whole
system
of
society
appears
to
me
to
depend
upon
this
stimulant
who
would
wish
to
be
the
heads
of
the
church
and
take
the
additional
responsibilites
and
labours
attached
to
them
without
reward
who
would
accept
the
office
the
weighty
office
of
being
her
majesty
ministers
without
reward
i
might
go
on
in
this
strain
of
reasoning
and
prove
that
rewards
are
founded
in
knowledge
of
human
nature
but
i
am
content
to
skew
we
have
some
ground
for
them
they
are
useful
if
not
essential
in
the
right
management
of
the
young
but
like
every
thing
else
require
to
be
managed
judiciously
it
appears
to
me
that
the
argument
to
the
contrary
would
be
untenable
i
should
like
to
see
the
man
who
would
invest
his
capital
in
railways
electric
telegraphs
steam
ships
and
in
business
of
any
kind
without
hope
of
reward
pooh
it
is
the
mainspring
of
human
action
the
incentive
to
public
service
it
rests
not
in
this
world
but
follows
us
to
the
next
well
done
good
and
faithful
servant
enter
into
the
joy
of
thy
lord
ah
but
this
refers
to
men
not
to
children
what
are
children
but
men
in
embryo
why
be
unjust
to
them
and
just
to
man
i
say
rewards
are
necessary
in
a
sound
system
of
education
to
little
children
if
judiciously
selected
and
properly
applied
they
will
be
found
incentives
to
action
and
add
greatly
to
the
pleasure
of
learning
in
my
other
work
for
the
education
of
older
children
this
subject
is
treated
of
more
at
length
as
applicable
to
them
with
regard
to
punishments
they
are
various
and
must
be
adapted
to
the
disposition
of
the
child
the
only
corporal
punishment
that
we
inflict
is
a
pat
on
the
hand
which
is
very
of
great
service
in
flagrant
cases
of
misconduct
for
instance
i
have
seen
one
child
bite
another
arm
until
it
has
almost
made
its
teeth
meet
i
should
suppose
few
persons
are
prepared
to
say
such
a
child
should
not
be
punished
for
it
i
have
seen
others
who
when
they
first
came
to
school
would
begin
to
scream
as
if
they
were
being
punished
as
soon
as
their
mother
brought
them
to
the
door
while
the
mother
continued
to
threaten
the
child
without
ever
putting
one
threat
into
execution
the
origin
of
all
this
noise
has
been
perhaps
because
the
child
has
demanded
a
as
the
condition
of
coming
to
school
and
the
mother
probably
has
not
had
one
to
give
him
but
has
actually
been
obliged
to
borrow
one
in
order
to
induce
him
to
come
in
at
the
school
door
thus
the
child
has
come
off
conqueror
and
set
it
down
as
a
maxim
that
for
the
future
he
may
do
just
as
he
pleases
with
his
mother
i
have
sometimes
made
my
appearance
at
this
time
to
know
what
all
the
noise
was
about
when
the
mother
has
entered
into
a
lamentable
tale
telling
me
what
trouble
she
has
had
with
the
child
and
that
he
would
not
come
to
school
without
having
a
each
time
but
the
moment
the
child
has
seen
me
all
has
been
as
quiet
as
possible
i
have
desired
him
to
give
me
the
which
he
has
done
directly
i
have
returned
it
to
the
mother
and
the
child
has
gone
into
school
as
quietly
as
any
child
could
do
i
have
had
others
who
would
throw
their
victuals
into
the
dirt
and
then
lie
down
in
it
themselves
and
refuse
to
rise
up
crying
i
will
go
home
i
want
to
go
into
the
fields
i
will
have
a
the
mother
has
answered
well
my
dear
you
shall
have
a
if
you
will
stay
at
school
no
i
want
to
go
and
play
with
billy
or
tommy
and
the
mother
at
length
has
taken
the
churl
home
again
and
thus
fed
his
vanity
and
nursed
his
pride
till
he
has
completely
mastered
her
so
that
she
has
been
glad
to
apply
to
the
school
again
and
beg
that
i
would
take
him
in
hand
at
another
time
a
girl
came
with
a
pillow
she
had
insisted
on
having
it
for
a
doll
but
so
far
from
contributing
to
her
happiness
it
had
a
contrary
effect
nevertheless
the
parent
for
want
of
that
firmness
so
necessary
in
the
management
of
children
had
allowed
her
to
bring
it
to
school
and
on
her
journey
she
cried
all
the
way
to
the
amusement
of
the
lookers
on
when
i
remonstrated
with
the
mother
she
replied
what
could
i
do
she
would
not
come
without
it
the
child
however
gave
it
up
to
me
without
any
trouble
and
the
over
took
it
back
with
her
numerous
have
been
the
instances
of
a
similar
kind
and
all
far
the
want
of
firmness
the
master
of
an
infant
school
whenever
opportunity
occurs
should
feel
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
urge
the
parents
to
make
a
due
use
of
judicious
parental
authority
this
is
the
very
foundation
of
all
social
order
rule
and
government
and
to
relax
it
is
to
loosen
the
very
keystone
of
society
he
ought
also
perpetually
to
inculcate
obedience
to
their
parents
upon
the
children
as
being
one
of
their
first
and
most
important
duties
some
have
objected
to
our
schools
that
they
are
calculated
to
loosen
the
ties
and
the
authority
between
parent
and
child
but
if
these
precepts
are
carefully
attended
to
the
result
will
be
precisely
the
reverse
it
is
however
necessary
to
state
in
the
three
cases
just
noticed
that
in
each
the
children
had
been
previously
conquered
by
me
and
young
as
they
were
they
knew
quite
well
that
although
such
conduct
as
they
exhibited
gained
the
end
they
had
in
view
with
the
parent
similar
conduct
would
not
succeed
with
me
it
is
little
short
of
cruelty
to
let
any
child
have
its
own
way
in
such
matters
they
will
always
try
hard
to
get
the
tipper
hand
not
knowing
but
that
such
conduct
adds
to
their
own
happiness
when
once
conquered
and
proof
is
afforded
that
it
does
not
then
the
children
are
always
thankful
for
the
discipline
at
all
events
i
have
never
found
it
otherwise
many
i
may
say
numerous
cases
have
occurred
of
worse
kinds
than
the
above
such
as
children
insisting
on
bringing
something
from
home
as
the
bellows
tongs
poker
the
mother
bonnet
father
hat
as
the
condition
of
coming
to
school
which
the
simple
parent
has
complied
with
rather
than
adopt
the
required
firmness
which
is
essential
in
matters
of
this
kind
more
infants
know
quite
well
the
weak
and
the
strong
points
of
a
parent
character
they
all
are
excellent
judges
on
this
subject
i
found
it
necessary
under
such
circumstances
to
enter
into
a
kind
of
agreement
with
the
mother
that
she
should
not
interfere
in
any
respect
whatever
that
on
such
conditions
and
such
only
could
the
child
be
admitted
observing
that
i
should
act
towards
it
as
if
it
were
my
own
but
that
it
must
and
should
be
obedient
to
me
to
which
the
mother
has
consented
and
the
child
has
been
taken
in
again
and
strange
to
say
in
less
than
a
fortnight
has
been
as
good
and
has
behaved
as
orderly
as
any
child
in
the
school
but
i
should
deem
myself
guilty
of
duplicity
and
deceit
were
i
to
say
that
such
children
in
all
cases
could
be
managed
without
corporal
punishment
as
it
appears
to
me
that
this
in
moderation
has
been
the
mode
of
correcting
refractory
children
from
the
earliest
ages
for
it
is
expressly
said
in
the
scriptures
that
spareth
his
rod
hateth
his
son
but
he
that
loveth
him
chasteneth
him
and
again
that
knoweth
his
lord
will
and
doeth
it
not
shall
be
beaten
with
many
there
is
certainly
something
very
pleasing
in
the
sound
that
several
hundred
infant
children
may
be
well
managed
kept
in
good
order
and
corrected
of
their
bad
habits
without
of
punishment
but
as
i
have
not
been
able
to
attain
to
that
state
of
perfection
in
the
art
of
teaching
i
shall
lay
before
the
reader
what
modes
of
punishment
i
have
adopted
and
the
success
that
attended
them
if
punishments
be
judiciously
and
justly
applied
when
offences
require
them
from
the
earliest
periods
of
life
they
will
soon
cease
to
be
wanted
we
can
not
form
a
more
important
association
in
the
young
mind
than
one
between
pain
and
moral
evil
and
this
judicious
correction
will
effect
it
should
not
be
given
in
anger
or
it
will
have
the
appearance
of
revenge
but
if
administered
calmly
and
with
feelings
of
sorrow
and
regret
it
will
soon
exercise
a
mighty
moral
influence
the
providence
of
god
applies
to
us
the
correction
of
sickness
pain
and
sorrow
to
withdraw
us
from
evil
and
thus
in
his
moral
government
as
well
as
in
his
word
he
commands
us
to
use
the
rod
but
always
for
good
and
never
in
anger
or
cruelty
recent
events
have
proved
to
me
that
there
is
a
mawkish
sentimentality
but
too
prevalent
on
this
subject
abroad
which
interferes
greatly
with
moral
training
the
proper
freedom
of
the
and
even
with
the
administration
of
public
justice
the
first
offence
deserving
punishment
which
i
shall
notice
is
playing
the
truant
and
i
trust
i
may
be
permitted
to
state
that
notwithstanding
the
children
are
so
very
young
they
frequently
at
first
stay
away
from
the
school
unknown
to
their
parents
nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
when
we
consider
how
they
have
been
permitted
to
range
the
streets
and
get
acquainted
with
other
children
in
similar
circumstances
when
this
is
the
case
they
can
not
be
brought
into
order
in
a
moment
it
is
a
work
of
time
and
requires
much
patience
and
perseverance
to
accomplish
it
effectually
it
is
well
known
that
when
we
accustom
ourselves
to
particular
company
and
form
acquaintances
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
give
them
up
and
it
is
a
maxim
that
a
man
is
either
better
or
worse
for
the
company
he
keeps
just
so
it
is
with
children
they
form
very
early
attachments
and
frequently
with
children
whose
parents
will
not
send
them
to
school
and
care
not
where
they
are
so
long
as
they
keep
out
of
their
way
hence
such
children
will
persuade
others
to
accompany
them
and
of
course
they
will
be
absent
from
school
but
as
night
approaches
the
child
will
begin
to
think
of
the
consequences
and
mention
it
to
his
companions
who
will
instruct
him
how
to
deceive
both
his
teachers
and
his
parents
and
perhaps
bring
him
through
his
trouble
this
will
give
him
fresh
confidence
and
finding
himself
successful
there
will
be
little
difficulty
in
persuading
him
to
accompany
them
a
second
time
i
have
had
children
absent
from
school
two
or
three
in
a
week
and
sometimes
whole
days
who
have
brought
me
such
rational
and
plausible
excuses
as
completely
to
put
me
off
my
guard
but
who
have
been
found
out
by
their
parents
from
having
stayed
out
till
seven
or
eight
at
night
the
parents
have
applied
at
the
school
to
know
why
they
kept
the
children
so
late
add
have
then
in
formed
me
that
they
have
been
absent
all
day
thus
the
whole
plot
has
been
developed
it
has
been
found
that
the
children
were
sent
to
school
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
had
their
dinners
given
them
to
eat
at
school
but
instead
of
coming
they
have
got
into
company
with
their
older
companions
who
in
many
cases
i
have
found
were
training
them
up
for
every
species
of
vice
some
of
them
have
been
cured
of
truant
playing
by
corporal
punishment
when
all
other
means
i
could
devise
have
failed
others
by
means
the
most
simple
such
as
causing
the
child
to
hold
a
broom
for
a
given
time
the
most
powerful
punishment
i
have
yet
discovered
is
to
insist
on
the
child
sitting
still
without
moving
hand
or
foot
for
a
given
time
say
half
an
hour
at
most
long
punishment
always
has
the
tendency
to
harden
the
child
he
soon
gets
contented
in
his
situation
and
you
defeat
your
own
object
by
keeping
a
strict
eye
upon
them
it
will
be
remarked
they
soon
begin
to
form
an
attachment
with
some
of
their
own
and
ultimately
become
as
fond
of
their
new
companions
their
books
and
their
school
as
they
were
before
of
their
old
companions
and
the
streets
i
need
scarcely
observe
how
strong
our
attachments
formed
in
early
years
at
school
are
and
i
doubt
not
but
many
who
read
this
have
found
a
valuable
and
real
friend
in
a
for
whom
they
would
do
any
thing
within
their
power
there
were
several
children
in
the
school
who
had
contracted
some
very
bad
habits
entirely
by
their
being
accustomed
to
run
about
the
streets
and
one
boy
in
particular
only
five
years
of
age
was
so
frequently
absent
and
brought
such
reasonable
excuses
for
his
being
so
that
it
was
some
time
before
i
detected
him
i
thought
it
best
to
see
his
mother
and
therefore
sent
the
boy
to
tell
her
that
i
wished
her
to
come
the
boy
soon
returned
saying
his
mother
was
not
at
home
the
following
morning
he
was
absent
again
and
i
sent
another
boy
to
know
the
reason
when
the
mother
waited
on
me
immediately
and
assured
me
that
she
had
sent
the
child
to
school
i
then
produced
the
slate
which
i
kept
for
that
purpose
and
informed
her
how
many
days
and
her
child
had
been
absent
during
the
last
month
when
she
again
assured
me
that
she
had
never
kept
the
child
at
home
for
a
single
nor
had
he
ever
told
her
that
i
wanted
to
see
her
at
the
same
time
observing
that
be
must
have
been
decoyed
away
by
some
of
the
children
in
the
neighbourhood
she
regretted
that
she
could
not
afford
to
send
him
to
school
before
adding
the
infant
school
was
a
blessed
institution
and
one
she
thought
much
wanted
in
the
i
need
scarcely
add
that
both
the
father
and
mother
lost
no
time
in
searching
for
their
child
and
after
several
hours
they
found
him
in
the
nearest
with
several
children
pretty
well
stored
with
apples
which
they
had
no
doubt
stolen
from
the
continually
placed
there
they
brought
him
to
the
school
and
informed
me
they
had
given
him
a
good
flogging
which
i
found
to
be
correct
from
the
marks
that
were
on
the
child
this
they
said
they
had
no
doubt
would
cure
him
but
he
was
not
so
soon
conquered
for
the
very
next
day
he
was
absent
again
and
after
the
parents
had
tried
every
experiment
they
could
think
of
in
vain
they
delivered
him
over
to
me
telling
me
i
might
do
what
i
thought
proper
i
tried
every
means
i
could
devise
with
as
little
success
except
keeping
him
at
school
after
school
hours
for
i
had
a
great
disinclination
to
convert
the
school
into
a
prison
as
my
object
was
if
possible
to
cause
the
children
to
love
the
school
and
i
knew
i
could
not
take
a
more
effectual
method
of
causing
them
to
dislike
it
than
by
keeping
them
there
against
their
will
at
last
i
tried
this
experiment
but
to
as
little
purpose
as
the
others
and
i
was
about
to
exclude
the
child
altogether
as
incorrigible
but
unwilling
that
it
should
be
said
a
child
five
years
old
had
mastered
us
i
at
last
hit
upon
an
expedient
which
had
the
desired
effect
the
plan
i
adopted
was
to
put
him
on
an
elevated
situation
within
sight
of
all
the
children
so
secured
that
he
could
not
hurt
himself
i
believe
it
was
the
force
of
that
effected
the
cure
this
i
had
never
tried
before
and
i
must
say
i
was
extremely
glad
to
witness
it
i
never
knew
him
absent
without
leave
afterwards
and
what
is
more
surprising
he
appeared
to
be
very
fond
of
the
school
and
became
a
very
good
child
was
not
this
then
a
brand
plucked
from
the
fire
i
have
been
advised
to
dismiss
twenty
such
children
rather
than
retain
them
by
the
above
means
but
if
there
be
more
joy
in
heaven
over
one
sinner
that
repenteth
than
over
ninety
and
nine
just
persons
who
need
no
repentance
ought
not
such
a
feeling
to
be
encouraged
on
earth
particularly
when
it
can
be
done
by
means
that
are
not
injurious
to
the
orderly
but
on
the
contrary
productive
of
the
best
effects
the
child
just
mentioned
afterwards
went
into
the
national
school
with
several
others
who
had
been
nearly
as
bad
as
himself
but
they
scarcely
ever
failed
to
come
and
see
me
when
they
had
a
half
holiday
and
the
master
of
the
school
told
me
that
not
one
of
them
had
ever
been
absent
without
leave
and
that
he
had
no
fault
to
find
with
them
i
have
further
to
observe
that
the
moment
i
perceived
a
bad
effect
produced
by
any
method
of
punishment
it
was
relinquished
but
i
feel
it
my
duty
here
to
caution
the
reader
against
the
too
frequent
practice
of
many
to
object
it
may
cost
a
man
many
years
to
find
out
what
may
be
desirable
and
workable
but
to
become
an
objector
requires
no
thought
accordingly
the
most
thoughtless
are
generally
the
greatest
objectors
i
believe
that
there
was
not
a
child
in
the
school
who
would
not
have
been
delighted
carry
the
if
i
had
called
it
play
the
other
children
might
have
laughed
as
long
as
they
pleased
for
he
would
have
laughed
as
heartily
as
any
of
them
and
as
soon
as
he
had
done
i
should
have
had
a
dozen
applicants
with
please
sir
may
i
please
sir
may
i
but
it
was
called
a
and
hence
i
had
no
applications
whatever
they
all
dreaded
it
as
much
as
they
would
a
flogging
i
am
aware
that
this
plan
of
punishment
may
appear
ridiculous
and
perhaps
it
would
be
so
to
use
it
for
older
children
but
with
such
young
children
i
have
found
it
to
answer
well
and
therefore
i
have
no
wish
to
dispense
with
it
i
would
however
have
care
taken
not
to
encourage
the
children
to
ridicule
each
other
while
undergoing
this
or
any
other
punishment
except
in
extraordinary
cases
such
as
the
one
i
have
mentioned
on
the
contrary
we
should
encourage
them
to
sympathize
with
and
comfort
a
child
as
soon
as
the
punishment
is
over
and
i
can
truly
add
that
i
do
not
recollect
a
single
instance
when
any
child
has
been
undergoing
the
broom
punishment
but
some
of
the
others
have
come
and
attempted
to
beg
him
off
with
please
sir
may
he
sit
down
now
and
when
asked
the
reason
why
they
wished
the
little
delinquent
to
be
forgiven
they
have
answered
may
be
sir
he
will
be
a
good
boy
their
request
has
been
complied
with
and
the
culprit
forgiven
and
what
have
i
seen
follow
why
that
which
has
taught
me
an
important
lesson
and
convinced
me
that
can
operate
on
each
other
minds
and
be
the
means
of
producing
very
often
better
effects
than
adult
people
i
have
seen
them
clasp
the
child
round
the
neck
take
him
by
the
hand
lead
him
about
the
comfort
him
in
every
possible
way
wipe
his
eyes
with
their
pinafores
and
ask
him
if
he
was
not
sorry
for
what
he
had
done
the
answer
has
been
yes
and
they
have
flown
to
me
with
master
he
says
he
is
sorry
for
it
and
that
he
will
not
do
it
again
in
short
they
have
done
that
which
i
could
not
do
they
have
so
won
the
child
over
by
kindness
that
it
has
caused
the
offender
not
only
to
be
fond
of
them
but
equally
as
fond
of
his
master
and
the
school
to
these
things
i
attribute
the
reclaiming
of
the
children
i
have
mentioned
and
so
far
from
punishment
being
productive
of
the
i
have
found
it
productive
of
the
best
the
ill
effects
of
expelling
children
as
incorrigible
may
be
seen
in
the
case
of
hartley
who
was
executed
some
years
back
he
confessed
before
his
execution
that
he
had
been
concerned
in
several
murders
and
upwards
of
two
hundred
burglaries
and
by
the
newspaper
account
we
learn
that
he
was
dismissed
from
school
at
nine
years
of
age
there
being
no
school
master
who
would
be
troubled
with
him
when
finding
himself
at
liberty
he
immediately
became
a
robber
hartley
father
the
account
proceeds
formerly
kept
the
sir
john
falstaff
inn
at
hull
in
yorkshire
he
was
put
to
school
in
that
neighbourhood
but
his
conduct
at
school
was
so
marked
with
depravity
and
so
continually
did
he
play
the
truant
that
he
was
dismissed
as
unmanageable
he
then
although
only
nine
years
of
age
began
with
pilfering
and
robbing
gardens
and
orchards
till
his
friends
were
obliged
to
send
him
to
sea
he
soon
contrived
to
run
away
from
the
ship
in
which
he
had
been
placed
and
having
regained
the
land
pursued
his
old
habits
and
got
connected
with
many
of
the
principal
thieves
in
london
with
whom
he
commenced
business
regularly
as
a
which
was
almost
always
his
line
of
robbery
should
not
every
means
have
been
resorted
to
with
this
child
before
proceeding
to
the
dangerous
mode
of
expulsion
for
it
is
not
the
whole
who
need
a
physician
but
those
who
are
sick
and
i
strongly
suspect
that
if
judicious
punishment
had
been
resorted
to
it
would
have
had
the
desired
effect
i
can
only
say
that
there
never
was
a
child
expelled
from
the
infant
school
under
my
care
as
incorrigible
in
conclusion
i
have
to
observe
that
the
broom
punishment
is
only
for
extraordinary
occasions
and
i
think
we
are
justified
in
having
recourse
to
any
means
that
are
consistent
with
duty
and
humanity
in
preference
to
turning
a
child
out
into
the
wide
world
of
all
the
difficulties
i
ever
had
to
encounter
to
legislate
for
rewards
and
punishments
gave
me
the
most
trouble
how
often
have
i
seen
one
child
laugh
at
that
which
would
make
another
child
cry
if
any
department
in
teaching
requires
knowledge
of
character
more
than
another
it
is
this
many
a
fine
child
spirits
are
broken
through
the
ignorance
of
teachers
and
parents
in
this
particular
but
for
me
to
lay
down
to
manage
would
be
like
a
person
undertaking
to
describe
a
voyage
to
the
moon
every
own
good
sense
must
decide
for
them
according
to
character
and
circumstances
and
as
to
rewards
the
same
discrimination
must
be
used
one
child
will
set
much
value
on
a
little
book
whilst
another
will
destroy
it
in
a
day
and
though
the
book
might
be
worth
the
sixpence
a
worth
of
what
call
good
stuff
would
be
much
more
valuable
i
have
had
more
business
done
sometimes
for
a
plum
than
for
a
sixpenny
book
it
is
never
necessary
to
give
the
child
badges
of
and
to
allow
it
as
many
orders
and
degrees
as
an
austrian
crosses
at
the
button
holes
and
bits
of
ribbon
on
the
shoulders
are
unnecessary
they
throw
an
apple
of
discord
between
the
young
creatures
who
have
sense
enough
to
see
that
these
things
are
frequently
given
away
with
a
wonderous
lack
of
discrimination
and
sometimes
to
please
parents
more
than
reward
merit
a
carraway
comfit
put
into
the
mouth
of
an
infant
will
do
more
good
than
all
the
badges
of
distinction
that
i
have
mentioned
as
a
reward
but
with
respect
to
punishment
more
will
be
said
on
it
in
my
larger
work
when
we
come
to
treat
of
national
education
each
creation
of
the
most
high
is
truly
wonderful
and
worthy
of
our
constant
study
we
may
learn
lessons
of
the
truest
wisdom
from
the
meanest
leaf
or
insect
if
we
would
regard
it
as
one
of
his
works
but
how
much
more
may
be
learnt
and
what
an
amount
of
useful
instruction
may
be
gained
by
a
study
of
the
finite
mind
the
highest
work
in
creation
many
have
turned
their
attention
to
minerals
plants
and
animals
and
thus
added
to
our
stores
of
knowledge
if
equal
attention
had
been
paid
to
the
young
mind
to
mark
the
gradual
germination
of
its
intellectual
and
moral
powers
how
much
more
accurate
would
our
knowledge
be
of
the
proper
methods
of
dealing
with
it
both
in
instruction
direction
and
punishment
thus
to
study
it
has
been
the
aim
of
my
life
and
i
have
made
observations
on
thousands
of
children
when
this
great
and
living
book
is
more
constantly
read
the
contents
of
this
humble
volume
may
have
a
better
chance
of
being
appreciated
and
the
utter
absurdity
of
many
things
palmed
upon
the
public
for
the
education
of
infants
made
glaringly

reading

brass
letters
their
without
things
words
accumulated
by
misery
in
the
memory
had
far
better
die
than
drag
out
a
miserable
existence
in
the
dark
without
words
theirs
stay
and
support
things
unaccountably
disappear
out
of
the
storehouse
and
may
be
lost
for
ever
but
bind
thing
with
a
a
strong
link
stronger
than
any
steel
and
softer
than
any
silk
and
the
captive
remains
for
ever
happy
in
its
bright
the
senses
of
children
having
revealed
every
object
in
its
true
light
they
next
desire
to
know
its
name
and
then
express
their
perceptions
in
words
this
you
have
to
gratify
and
from
the
time
you
tell
them
the
name
of
an
object
it
is
the
representative
of
the
thing
in
the
mind
of
the
child
if
the
object
be
not
present
but
you
mention
the
name
this
suggests
it
to
the
infant
mind
had
this
been
more
frequently
thought
of
by
instructors
we
should
have
found
them
less
eager
to
make
the
child
acquainted
with
the
names
of
things
of
which
it
has
no
knowledge
or
perception
sounds
and
signs
which
give
rise
to
no
idea
in
the
mind
because
the
child
has
never
seen
or
known
the
things
represented
are
of
no
use
and
can
only
burden
the
memory
it
is
therefore
the
object
of
our
system
to
give
the
children
a
knowledge
of
things
and
then
a
knowledge
of
the
words
which
represent
those
things
these
remarks
not
only
apply
to
the
names
of
visible
things
but
more
particularly
to
those
which
are
abstract
if
i
would
say
shew
a
child
before
you
tell
it
the
name
of
the
animal
still
more
would
i
urge
it
on
the
teacher
to
let
a
child
see
what
love
kindness
religion
are
before
it
is
told
what
names
to
designate
those
principles
by
if
our
ignorance
as
to
material
things
be
the
result
of
instructing
the
children
in
names
instead
of
enabling
them
to
become
acquainted
with
things
so
on
the
other
hand
i
believe
we
may
account
in
the
same
way
to
some
extent
for
being
so
frequently
a
mere
word
an
empty
sound
amongst
men
instead
of
an
active
principle
our
next
endeavour
is
to
teach
the
children
to
express
their
thoughts
upon
things
and
if
they
are
not
checked
by
injudicious
treatment
they
will
have
some
on
every
subject
we
first
teach
them
to
express
we
then
tell
them
ours
and
truth
will
prevail
even
in
the
minds
of
children
on
this
plan
it
will
operate
by
its
own
strength
not
by
the
power
of
coercion
which
renders
even
truth
disagreeable
and
repulsive
the
children
will
adopt
it
from
choice
in
preference
to
error
and
it
will
be
firmly
established
in
their
minds
it
will
no
doubt
be
perceived
that
for
the
promotion
of
the
course
here
recommended
it
will
be
advisable
to
connect
with
our
and
reading
as
much
information
as
we
possibly
can
by
so
doing
the
tedium
of
the
task
to
the
child
will
be
considerably
lessened
as
well
as
much
knowledge
attained
the
means
of
doing
this
in
a
variety
of
ways
will
no
doubt
suggest
themselves
to
the
intelligent
teacher
but
as
an
illustration
of
what
we
mean
the
following
conversational
plan
may
not
be
useless
we
have
cards
and
each
card
has
on
it
one
letter
of
the
alphabet
and
some
object
in
nature
the
first
for
instance
has
the
letter
a

the
top
and
an
apple
painted
on
the
bottom

desired
to
go
into
the
gallery
which
is
formed
of
seats
one
above
the
other
at
one
end
of
the
school
the
master
places
himself

can
see

soon
be

thus
become

may
be
proper
to
mention
also
that
the

hunting
and
fishing
q
what
is
hunting
a
following
animals
to
catch
them
q
who
made
all
the
animals
almighty
god
the
method
above
described
is
adapted
to
the
large
room
where
the
children
may
be
taught
all
together
but
it
is
necessary
to
change
the
scene
even
in
this
for
however
novel
and
pleasing
a
thing
may
be
at
first
if
it
be
not
managed
with
prudence
it
will
soon
lose
its
effect
it
is
here
to
be
observed
that
the
mode
of
teaching
described
is
not
practised
every
day
but
only
twice
or
thrice
a
week
the
children
will
take
care
that
the
teacher
does
not
altogether
forget
to
teach
them
in
any
way
that
they
have
been
accustomed
to
after
letting
the
above
plan
lie
by
for
a
day
or
two
some
of
the
children
will
come
to
the
teacher
and
say
please
sir
may
we
say
the
picture
alphabet
up
in
the
gallery
if
the
other
children
overhear
the
question
it
will
go
through
the
school
like
lightning
oh
yes
yes
yes
sir
if
you
please
do
let
us
say
the
letters
in
the
gallery
thus
a
desire
is
created
in
the
children
minds
and
it
is
then
especially
that
they
may
be
taught
with
good
effect
which
we
adopt
is
in
practice
almost
every
day
but
it
is
better
adapted
to
what
is
called
the
we
have
the
alphabet
printed
in
large
letters
both
in
roman
and
italic
characters
on
one
sheet
of
paper
this
paper
is
pasted
on
a
board
or
on
pasteboard
and
placed
against
the
wall
the
whole
class
then
stand
around
it
but
instead
of
one
of
the
monitors
pointing
to
the
letters
the
master
or
mistress
does
it
so
that
the
children
not
only
obtain
instruction
from
each
other
but
every
child
has
a
lesson
from
the
master
or
mistress
twice
every
day
before
they
go
to
the
reading
lessons
they
have
the
sounds
of
all
the
words
in
spelling
thus
the
sound
of
a
ball
call
fall
wall
then
the
is
full
of
words
of
the
same
sound
in
like
manner
they
proceed
with
other
letters
as
i
the
sound
of
which
they
learn
from
such
words
as
five
drive
strive
until
by
a
series
of
lessons
they
become
acquainted
with
all
the
sounds
and
are
able
to
read
any
common
book
i
have
observed
in
some
instances
the
most
deplorable
laxity
in
this
particular
cases
have
occurred
in
which
children
have
been
for
two
years
at
school
and
yet
scarcely
knew
the
whole
alphabet
and
i
have
known
others
to
be
four
years
in
an
infant
school
without
being
able
to
read
i
hesitate
not
to
say
that
the
fault
rests
exclusively
with
the
teachers
who
finding
this
department
of
their
work
more
troublesome
than
others
which
are
attractive
to
visitors
have
sometimes
neglected
it
and
even
thrown
it
entirely
aside
affirming
that
reading
is
not
a
part
of
the
infant
system
at
all
such
a
declaration
is
however
only
to
be
accounted
for
from
the
most
lamentable
ignorance
preverseness
or
both
had
it
been
true
we
should
not
have
had
a
single
infant
school
in
scotland
and
throughout
that
country
the
children
read
delightfully
the
great
importance
of
full
instruction
in
reading
will
be
apparent
from
the
following
considerations
if
the
parents
do
not
find
the
children
learn
to
read
they
will
discontinue
sending
them
this
they
consider
essential
and
nothing
else
will
be
deemed
by
them
an
adequate
substitute
children
can
not
make
desirable
progress
in
other
schools
which
they
may
enter
unless
they
obtain
an
ability
to
read
at
least
simple
lessons
neglect
in
this
respect
impedes
the
progress
of
the
infant
system
such
an
obstacle
ought
not
to
exist
and
should
at
once
be
removed
in
manufacturing
districts
children
go
to
work
very
soon
and
if
they
are
not
able
to
read
before
there
is
reason
to
fear
they
will
not
afterwards
acquire
the
power
but
if
they
have
this
sunday
schools
may
supply
other
deficiencies
want
of
ability
to
read
prevents
of
course
a
knowledge
of
the
word
of
god
to
prevent
this
evil
i
have
arranged
a
series
denominated
developing
lessons
the
great
object
of
which
is
to
induce
children
to
think
and
reflect
on
what
they
see
they
are
thus
formed
at
the
top
is
a
coloured
picture
or
series
of
coloured
pictures
of
insects
quadrupeds
and
general
objects
for
instance
there
is
one
containing
the
poplar
and
wasp
the
lesson
is
as
follows
the
wasp
can
sting
and
fly
as
well
as
the
moth
which
does
not
sting
i
hope
no
wasp
will
sting
me
he
is
small
but
the
is
large
the
moth
eats
leaves
but
the
wasp
loves
sweet
things
and
makes
a
round
nest
if
boys
take
the
nest
they
may
be
stung
the
fish
like
the
on
this
questions
are
proposed
which
stings
which
is
small
and
which
large
which
eats
leaves
which
makes
a
round
nest
to
take
another
instance
there
is
a
figure
of
an
italian
to
which
is
appended
the
following
the
italian
has
got
a
flask
of
oil
and
a
fish
in
his
hand
and
something
else
in
his
hand
which
the
little
child
who
reads
this
must
find
out
any
child
can
tell
who
makes
use
of
the
sense
of
seeing
in
italy
they
make
a
good
deal
of
wine
big
grapes
grow
there
that
they
make
it
with
italians
can
sing
very
well
and
so
can
little
children
when
they
are
taught
questions
are
likewise
proposed
on
this
as
before
of
these
lessons
however
there
is
a
great
variety
all
schools
should
possess
them
they
will
effectually
prevent
the
evil
alluded
to
by
checking
the
apathy
of
children
in
learning
to
read
and
calling
the
teacher
powers
into
full
exercise
they
are
equally
adapted
to
spelling
and
reading
i
will
give
several
specimens
of
reading
lessons
in
natural
history
each
of
which
has
a
large
and
coloured
plate
at
the
top
copied
from
nature
the
eagle
how
glad
some
poor
children
would
be
if
they
could
read
about
the
eagle
he
is
a
big
strong
bird
and
has
such
great
wings
and
such
long
sharp
claws
that
he
can
dig
them
into
the
lamb
hare
rabbit
and
other
animals
and
thus
fly
away
with
them
to
feed
his
young
ones
and
to
eat
them
himself
eagles
make
such
a
large
nest
on
the
side
of
some
high
rock
where
nobody
can
get
at
it
there
used
to
be
eagles
in
wales
and
there
are
some
now
in
scotland
but
very
few
in
england
for
they
do
not
like
to
be
where
there
are
many
people
almighty
gave
man
dominion
over
the
birds
of
the
as
well
as
over
the
other
animals
and
as
he
gave
man
power
to
if
the
eagles
become
troublesome
men
catch
them
though
they
can
fly
so
high
and
as
the
eagle
knows
this
he
likes
to
keep
out
of
our
way
and
go
into
parts
of
the
world
where
there
are
not
so
many
people
there
are
many
sorts
of
eagles
the
black
eagle
the
sea
eagle
the
bald
eagle
and
others
they
have
all
strong
bills
bent
down
in
front
and
strong
claws
this
bird
is
mentioned
in
the
bible
questions
are
proposed
after
this
is
read
and
thus
the
examination
proceeds
q
what
is
that
a
an
eagle
q
what
sort
of
a
bird
is
he
a
he
is
big
and
strong
q
what
are
those
a
his
feathers
q
what
else
are
they
called
a
his
plumage
q
is
the
eagle
a
small
bird
a
no
very
large
q
are
his
claws
long
and
sharp
a
yes
q
what
animals
could
he
carry
away
a
a
lamb
a
hare
a
rabbit
or
other
small
animals
q
what
does
he
do
with
those
a
feed
his
young
ones
q
where
does
the
eagle
make
his
nest
a
on
the
side
of
some
rock
q
why
does
he
make
it
there
a
that
no
one
may
get
at
it
q
used
there
to
be
eagles
in
wales
a
yes
q
where
are
there
a
few
still
a
in
england
scotland
and
ireland
q
why
are
they
not
as
plentiful
as
they
were
a
because
they
do
not
like
to
be
where
many
men
live
q
did
the
almighty
give
man
dominion
over
the
birds
of
the
air
a
yes
q
what
other
power
did
he
give
man
a
power
to
think
q
as
men
can
think
when
the
eagles
became
troublesome
what
did
they
do
a
they
caught
them
q
and
what
did
the
eagles
that
were
not
caught
do
a
they
went
to
places
where
men
were
not
so
plenty
q
are
there
many
different
kinds
of
eagles
a
yes
q
name
some
a
the
black
eagle
the
bald
eagle
the
sea
eagle
and
others
the
vulture
the
vulture
is
like
the
eagle
in
size
and
some
of
its
habits
but
it
is
so
very
different
from
it
in
many
ways
that
there
is
little
danger
of
confusing
the
two
together
the
greatest
distinction
between
them
is
that
the
head
of
the
vulture
is
either
quite
naked
or
covered
only
with
a
short
down
while
the
eagle
is
well
feathered
this
is
the
chief
difference
in
appearance
but
in
their
habits
there
is
a
much
greater
instead
of
flying
over
hills
and
valleys
in
pursuit
of
living
game
the
vultures
only
search
for
dead
carcasses
which
they
prefer
although
they
may
have
been
a
long
time
dead
and
therefore
very
bad
and
smelling
very
offensively
they
generally
live
in
very
warm
countries
and
are
useful
in
clearing
away
those
dead
carcasses
which
but
for
them
would
cause
many
dreadful
diseases
in
some
countries
indeed
on
account
of
this
the
inhabitants
will
not
allow
any
one
to
injure
them
and
they
are
called
for
this
reason
scavengers
which
means
that
they
do
the
business
for
which
scavengers
are
employed
vultures
are
very
greedy
and
ravenous
they
will
often
eat
so
much
that
they
are
not
able
to
move
or
fly
but
sit
quite
stupidly
and
insensible
one
of
them
will
often
at
a
single
meal
devour
the
entire
body
of
an
albatross
bones
and
all
which
is
a
bird
nearly
as
large
as
the
vulture
itself
they
will
smell
a
dead
carcass
at
a
very
great
distance
and
will
soon
surround
and
devour
it
vultures
lay
two
eggs
at
a
time
and
only
once
a
year
they
build
their
nests
on
the
same
kind
of
places
as
eagles
do
so
that
it
is
very
hard
to
find
them
what
does
the
vulture
resemble
the
eagle
in
a
in
size
and
in
some
of
its
habits
q
in
what
does
it
differ
from
the
eagle
a
in
having
a
neck
and
head
either
naked
or
covered
with
short
down
q
what
is
the
difference
in
the
manner
in
which
they
feed
a
the
eagle
seeks
its
food
over
hill
and
valley
and
lives
entirely
on
prey
which
he
takes
alive
while
the
vulture
seeks
out
dead
and
putrid
carcasses
q
for
what
reason
do
you
suppose
is
the
vulture
neck
not
covered
with
feathers
as
the
eagle
is
a
if
they
had
feathers
on
their
necks
like
eagles
and
hawks
they
would
soon
become
clotted
with
blood
q
why
would
this
happen
a
because
they
are
continually
plunging
their
necks
into
decayed
flesh
and
bloody
carcasses
q
how
do
vultures
sit
a
in
a
dull
mopeing
manner
q
where
do
they
generally
sit
a
on
tall
dead
trees
q
do
they
continue
thus
long
a
yes
for
several
hours
q
what
is
the
cause
of
their
thus
sitting
so
dull
and
inactive
a
the
great
quantity
of
food
they
have
eaten
q
is
there
any
description
of
vulture
forming
an
exception
to
the
general
character
of
those
birds
a
yes
that
particular
kind
called
the
snake
eater
q
where
is
this
bird
a
native
of
a
of
africa
q
why
is
it
called
the
snake
eater
a
on
account
of
its
singular
manner
of
destroying
serpents
on
which
it
feeds
q
describe
the
manner
in
which
this
bird
kills
its
prey
a
he
waits
until
the
serpent
raises
its
head
and
then
strikes
him
with
his
wing
and
repeats
the
blow
until
the
serpent
is
killed
q
what
do
the
natives
of
asia
and
africa
call
the
vulture
a
the
scavenger
q
why
a
because
they
are
so
useful
in
eating
dead
carcasses
q
how
is
this
useful
a
it
clears
the
ground
of
them
otherwise
in
those
warm
places
they
would
be
the
cause
of
much
disease
q
what
does
this
shew
us
a
that
the
good
god
has
created
nothing
without
its
use
q
what
is
the
largest
bird
of
the
vulture
kind
a
the
great
condor
of
south
america
q
what
does
its
wing
often
measure
from
tip
to
tip
twelve
feet
when
spread
out
q
how
do
the
natives
of
south
america
often
catch
the
vulture
a
the
dead
carcass
of
a
cow
or
horse
is
set
for
a
bait
on
which
they
feed
so
ravenously
that
they
become
stupid
and
are
easily
taken
the
crocodile
i
hope
you
will
not
put
your
dirty
hands
on
this
picture
of
the
crocodile
the
live
ones
have
hard
scales
on
their
backs
and
such
a
many
teeth
that
they
could
bite
a
man
leg
off
but
there
are
none
in
our
land
only
young
ones
that
sailors
bring
home
with
them
the
crocodile
can
run
fast
those
are
best
off
who
are
out
of
his
way
he
lives
by
the
water
he
goes
much
in
it
and
he
can
swim
well
young
ones
come
out
of
eggs
which
the
old
ones
lay
in
the
sand
some
beasts
eat
the
eggs
or
else
there
would
be
too
many
crocodiles
the
crocodile
can
run
fast
if
he
runs
straight
and
those
who
wish
to
get
out
of
his
way
run
zigzag
and
he
takes
some
time
to
turn
the
poor
black
men
know
this
and
can
get
out
of
his
way
but
some
of
them
can
fight
and
kill
him
on
the
land
or
in
the
water
i
think
the
crocodile
is
mentioned
in
ask
your
teacher
what
scripture
means
when
you
learn
geography
you
will
know
where
many
of
the
places
are
that
are
mentioned
in
the
bible
and
you
will
see
where
the
river
nile
is
there
are
such
a
many
crocodiles
on
the
banks
of
that
river
that
the
people
are
afraid
to
go
alone
what
a
many
wonderful
animals
our
great
creator
has
made
how
humble
and
thankful
we
should
be
to
see
so
many
great
wonders
q
what
have
crocodiles
on
their
backs
a
hard
scales
q
have
they
many
teeth
a
yes
a
great
many
q
could
they
bite
off
a
man
leg
a
they
could
q
are
there
any
in
our
country
a
none
wild
but
a
few
that
sailors
bring
in
ships
q
can
the
crocodile
run
fast
a
yes
q
where
does
he
live
a
in
the
water
q
what
do
their
young
ones
come
out
of
a
out
of
eggs
which
the
old
one
lays
in
the
sand
q
how
do
people
run
that
wish
to
get
out
of
the
crocodile
way
zigzag
like
the
waved
line
in
our
lesson
q
what
do
some
men
do
a
fight
and
kill
them
in
the
water
q
where
do
most
of
those
animals
live
a
in
the
river
nile
q
where
is
this
river
a
in
egypt
the
spelling
lessons
contain
words
capable
of
explanation
such
as
white
black
round
square
others
are
classed
as
fleet
ship
brig
sloop
and
others
are
in
contrast
as
hot
cold
dark
light
wet
dry
in
this
department
we
use
the
tablet
placed
beneath
the
arithmeticon
the
invention
and
improvement
of
which
are
described
in
the
volume
entitled
early
discipline
illustrated
or
the
infant
system
successful
and
progressing
a
clear
idea
of
the
whole
apparatus
is
given
by
the
on
the
next
page
and
it
ought
certainly
to
be
found
in
every
infant
school
the
sense
of
sight
is
then
brought
into
full
action
to
aid
the
mind
and
that
with
results
which
would
not
easily
be
conceived
we
shall
take
another
opportunity
of
explaining
the
use
of
the
upper
part
of
the
apparatus
the
lower
demanding
our
present
attention
illustration
to
use
the
let
the
followings
things
be
observed
it
is
supposed
the
children
know
well
there
are
letters
in
the
alphabet
that
twenty
are
called
consonants
and
that
six
are
vowels
we
take
first
one
perpendicular
row
of
letters
in
the
figure
now
point
to
d
and
say
what
is
that
and
the
answer
will
be
ask
is
it
a
vowel
or
consonant
and
they
will
reply
a
consonant
but
ask
why
do
you
know
it
is
d
and
the
answer
will
probably
be
it
is
so
because
it
is
hide
the
circular
part
of
the
letter
and
ask
what
is
the
position
of
the
other
part
and
they
will
say
having
previously
learnt
the
elements
of
form
which
will
shortly
be
explained
a
perpendicular
line
hide
that
and
ask
them
what
the
other
part
is
telling
them
to
bend
one
of
their
in
the
same
form
and
they
will
say
a
curved
line
if
they
are
then
asked
how
they
may
know
it
is
d
they
will
say
because
it
is
made
of
a
perpendicular
line
and
has
a
curved
line
behind
further
information
may
then
be
given
turn
the
d
letter
up
thus
illustration
the
character
d
turned
on
its
side
and
say
i
want
to
teach
you
the
difference
between
concave
and
convex
the
under
part
of
the
curve
is
concave
and
the
upper
part
of
it
is
convex
then
say
i
shall
now
take
the
letter
away
and
wish
you
to
shew
me
concave
and
convex
on
one
of
your
fingers
when
they
will
bend
the
forefinger
and
point
them
both
out
on
it
go
on
with
the
other
letters
in
the
same
way
shew
them
the
vowels
after
the
consonants
and
analyze
each
one
for
example
a
is
formed
of
two
inclined
lines
and
a
horizontal
line
to
join
them
in
the
centre
and
the
top
of
that
letter
is
an
acute
angle
and
were
a
line
placed
at
the
bottom
it
would
be
a
triangle
a
brass
letter
may
be
moreover
shewn
to
be
a
substance
its
properties
may
be
described
as
hard
smooth
bright
and
its
coming
from
the
mineral
kingdom
may
be
noticed
and
thus
the
instruction
may
be
indefinitely
varied
the
of
letters
may
then
be
pointed
out
ask
them
to
spell
m
r
and
they
will
give
you
the
sound
of
r
or
something
like
it
and
so
in
reference
to
other
letters
but
place
the
a
against
the
m
as
it
appears
in
the
figure
and
you
may
teach
them
to
say
a
m
am
and
thus
all
the
way
down
the
left
side
of
the
row
of
consonants
if
then
you
carry
the
vowel
down
on
the
other
side
of
them
you
will
change
the
lesson
and
by
such
means
go
on
almost
double
rows
of
consonants
may
be
placed
with
a
vowel
between
them
and
when
well
practiced
in
this
they
will
ask
for
the
vowel
to
be
omitted
that
they
may
supply
it
which
they
will
do
very
readily
and
with
great
pleasure
while
there
is
a
tasking
of
the
mind
which
can
not
but
prove
beneficial
again
turn
the
frame
with
the
balls
round
so
that
the
wires
are
perpendicular
instead
of
horizontal
raise
a
ball
gently
and
say
to
ascend
ascending
ascended
let
it
fall
gently
saying
to
descend
descending
descended
with
a
little
explanation
these
words
will
then
be
understood
and
others
may
be
taught
in
the
same
way
to
fall
falling
fallen
to
rise
rising
risen
to
go
going
gone
will
readily
occur
and
others
will
easily
be
supplied
by
the
ingenuity
of
the
instructor
the
frame
may
also
be
applied
to
it
is
to
be
used
as
follows
move
one
of
the
balls
to
a
part
of
the
frame
distinct
from
the
rest
the
children
will
then
repeat
there
is
there
is
apply
your
finger
to
the
ball
and
set
it
running
round
the
children
will
immediately
change
from
saying
there
is
to
there
goes
there
goes
when
they
have
repeated
there
it
goes
long
enough
to
impress
it
on
their
memory
stop
the
ball
the
children
will
probably
say
now
stops
now
stops
when
that
is
the
case
move
another
ball
to
it
and
then
explain
to
the
children
the
difference
between
singular
and
plural
desiring
them
to
call
out
there
are
there
are
and
when
they
have
done
that
as
long

may
be
proper
set
both
balls
moving
and
it
is
likely
they
will
call
out
there
go
there
go
i
do
not
particularize
further
because
i
know
that
good
teachers
will
at
once
see
the
principle
aimed
at
and
supply
the
other
requisite
lessons

object
of
this

principle
of
the

to
go

in
arithmetic
as
in
every
other
branch
of

the
principal
object
should
be
to
preserve
the
understanding
from
implicit
belief
to
invigorate
its
powers
and
to
induce
the
laudable
ambition
of
progressive
improvement
the
advantage
of
a
knowledge
of
arithmetic
has
never
been
disputed
its
universal
application
to
the
business
of
life
renders
it
an
important
acquisition
to
all
ranks
and
conditions
of
men
the
practicability
of
imparting
the
rudiments
of
arithmetic
to
very
young
children
has
been
satisfactorily
shewn
by
the
system
and
it
has
been
found
likewise
that
it
is
the
readiest
and
surest
way
of
developing
the
thinking
faculties
of
the
infant
mind
since
the
most
complicated
and
difficult
questions
of
arithmetic
as
well
as
the
most
simple
are
all
solvable
by
the
same
rules
and
on
the
same
principles
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
give
children
a
clear
insight
into
the
primary
principles
of
number
for
this
purpose
we
take
care
to
shew
them
by
visible
objects
that
all
numbers
are
combinations
of
unity
and
that
all
changes
of
number
must
arise
either
from
adding
to
or
taking
from
a
certain
stated
number
after
this
or
rather
perhaps
i
should
say
in
conjunction
with
this
instruction
we
exhibit
to
the
children
the
of
number
and
make
them
acquainted
with
their
various
combinations
and
lastly
we
bring
them
to
the
abstract
consideration
of
number
or
what
may
be
termed
if
you
reverse
this
which
has
generally
been
the
system
of
instruction
pursued
if
you
set
a
child
to
learn
its
multiplication
pence
and
other
tables
before
you
have
shewn
it
by
the
combinations
of
unity
which
these
tables
express
in
words
you
are
rendering
the
whole
abstruse
difficult
and
uninteresting
and
in
short
are
giving
it
knowledge
which
it
is
unable
to
apply
as
far
as
regards
the
general
principles
of
numerical
tuition
it
may
be
sufficient
to
state
that
we
should
begin
with
unity
and
proceed
very
gradually
by
slow
and
sure
steps
through
the
simplest
forms
of
combinations
to
the
more
comprehensive
trace
and
retrace
your
first
steps
the
children
can
never
be
too
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
first
principles
or
facts
of
number
we
have
various
ways
of
teaching
arithmetic
in
use
in
the
schools
i
shall
speak
of
them
all
beginning
with
a
description
of
the
arithmeticon
which
is
of
great
utility
illustration
i
have
thought
it
necessary
in
this
edition
to
give
the
original
woodcut
of
the
arithmeticon
which
it
will
be
seen
contains
twelve
wires
with
one
ball
on
the
first
wire
two
on
the
second
and
so
progressing
up
to
twelve
the
improvement
is
that
each
wire
should
contain
twelve
balls
so
that
the
whole
of
the
multiplication
table
may
be
done
by
it
up
to
times
are
the
next
step
was
having
the
balls
painted
black
and
white
alternately
to
assist
the
sense
of
seeing
it
being
certain
that
an
uneducated
eye
can
not
distinguish
the
combinations
of
colour
any
more
than
an
uneducated
ear
can
distinguish
the
combinations
of
sounds
so
far
the
thing
succeeded
with
respect
to
the
sense
of
seeing
but
there
was
yet
another
thing
to
be
legislated
for
and
that
was
to
prevent
the
children
attention
being
drawn
off
from
the
objects
to
which
it
was
to
be
directed
viz
the
smaller
number
of
balls
as
separated
from
the
greater
this
object
could
only
be
attained
by
inventing
a
board
to
slide
in
and
hide
the
greater
number
from
their
view
and
so
far
we
succeeded
in
gaining
their
undivided
attention
to
the
balls
we
thought
necessary
to
move
out
time
and
experience
only
could
shew
that
there
was
another
thing
wanting
and
that
was
a
tablet
as
represented
in
the
second
woodcut
which
had
a
tendency
to
teach
the
children
the
difference
between
real
numbers
and
representative
characters
therefore
the
necessity
of
brass
figures
as
represented
on
the
tablet
hence
the
children
would
call
figure
seven
no
it
being
but
one
object
and
each
figure
they
would
only
count
as
one
thus
making
which
are
the
representative
characters
only
three
which
is
the
real
fact
there
being
only
three
objects
it
was
therefore
found
necessary
to
teach
the
children
that
the
figure
seven
would
represent
ones
tens
hundreds
thousands
or
millions
according
to
where
it
might
be
placed
in
connection
with
the
other
figures
and
as
this
has
already
been
described
i
feel
it
unnecessary
to
enlarge
upon
the
subject
illustration
the
arithmeticon
it
will
be
seen
that
on
the
twelve
parallel
wires
there
are
balls
alternately
black
and
white
by
these
the
elements
of
arithmetic
may
be
taught
as
follows
take
one
ball
from
the
lowest
wire
and
say
units
two
from
the
next
and
say
tens
three
from
the
third
and
say
hundreds
four
from
the
fourth
and
say
thousands
five
from
the
fifth
and
say
tens
of
thousands
six
from
the
sixth
and
say
hundreds
of
thousands
seven
from
the
seventh
and
say
millions
eight
from
the
eighth
and
say
tens
of
millions
nine
from
the
ninth
and
say
hundreds
of
millions
ten
from
the
tenth
and
say
thousands
of
millions
eleven
from
the
eleventh
and
say
tens
of
thousands
of
millions
twelve
from
the
twelfth
and
say
hundreds
of
thousands
of
millions
the
tablet
beneath
the
balls
has
six
spaces
for
the
insertion
of
brass
letters
and
figures
a
box
of
which
accompanies
the
frame
suppose
then
the
only
figure
inserted
is
the
in
the
second
space
from
the
top
now
were
the
children
asked
what
it
was
they
would
all
say
without
instruction
it
is
one
if
however
you
tell
them
that
an
object
of
such
a
form
stands
instead
of
seven
ones
and
place
seven
balls
together
on
a
wire
they
will
at
once
see
the
use
and
power
of
the
number
place
a
next
the
seven
merely
ask
what
it
is
and
they
will
reply
we
do
know
but
if
you
put
out
three
balls
on
a
wire
they
will
say
instantly
o
it
is
three
ones
or
three
and
that
they
may
have
the
proper
name
they
may
be
told
that
they
have
before
them
and
put
a
to
these
figures
and
their
attention
will
be
arrested
say
do
you
think
you
can
tell
me
what
this
is
and
while
you
are
speaking
move
the
balls
gently
out
and
as
soon
as
they
see
them
they
will
immediately
cry
out
nine
and
in
this
way
they
may
acquire
a
knowledge
of
all
the
figures
separately
then
you
may
proceed
thus
units
tens
place
three
balls
on
the
top
wire
and
seven
on
the
second
and
say
as
you
point
to
the
figures
and
as
you
point
to
the
balls
then
go
on
units
tens
hundreds
place
nine
balls
on
the
top
wire
three
on
the
second
and
seven
on
the
third
and
say
pointing
to
each
nine
hundred
and
and
so
onwards
to
assist
the
understanding
and
exercise
the
judgment
slide
a
figure
in
the
frame
and
say
figure
q
what
is
this
a
no
q
if
no
be
put
on
the
left
side
of
the
what
will
it
be
a
q
if
the
be
put
on
the
right
side
then
what
will
it
be
a
q
if
the
figure
be
put
before
the
then
what
will
the
number
be
a
q
shift
the
figure
and
put
it
on
the
left
side
of
the
then
ask
the
children
to
tell
the
number
the
answer
is
the
teacher
can
keep
adding
and
shifting
as
he
pleases
according
to
the
capacity
of
his
pupils
taking
care
to
explain
as
he
goes
on
and
to
satisfy
himself
that
his
little
flock
perfectly
understand
him
suppose
figures
are
in
the
frame
then
let
the
children
begin
at
the
left
hand
saying
units
tens
hundreds
thousands
tens
of
thousands
hundreds
of
thousands
millions
tens
of
millions
hundreds
of
millions
thousands
of
millions
after
which
begin
at
the
right
side
and
they
will
say
five
thousand
four
hundred
and
million
nine
hundred
and
thousand
eight
hundred
and
if
the
children
are
practised
in
this
way
they
will
soon
learn
numeration
the
frame
was
employed
for
this
purpose
long
before
its
application
to
others
was
perceived
but
at
length
i
found
we
might
proceed
to
we
proceed
as
follows
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
then
the
master
may
exercise
them
backwards
saying
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
are
and
is
and
so
on
in
great
variety
again
place
seven
balls
on
one
wire
and
two
on
the
next
and
ask
them
how
many
and
are
to
this
they
will
soon
answer
nine
then
put
the
brass
figure
on
the
tablet
beneath
and
they
will
see
how
the
amount
is
marked
then
take
eight
balls
and
three
when
they
will
see
that
eight
and
three
are
eleven
explain
to
them
that
they
can
not
put
underneath
two
figure
ones
which
mean
but
they
must
put
under
the
and
carry
to
the
when
you
must
place
one
ball
under
the
four
and
asking
them
what
that
makes
they
will
say
five
proceed
by
saying
how
much
are
five
and
nine
put
out
the
proper
number
of
balls
and
they
will
say
five
and
nine
are
fourteen
put
a
four
underneath
and
tell
them
as
there
is
no
figure
to
put
the
under
it
must
be
placed
next
to
it
hence
they
see
that
added
to
make
a
total
of
may
be
taught
in
as
many
ways
by
this
instrument
thus
take
from
nothing
remains
moving
the
first
ball
at
the
same
time
to
the
other
end
of
the
frame
then
remove
one
from
the
second
wire
and
say
take
one
from
the
children
will
instantly
perceive
that
only
remains
then
from
and
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
then
the
balls
may
be
worked
backwards
beginning
at
the
wire
containing
balls
saying
take
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remain
from
remains
the
brass
figure
should
be
used
for
the
remainder
in
each
case
say
then
can
you
take
from
as
you
point
to
the
figures
and
they
will
say
yes
but
skew
them
balls
on
a
wire
and
ask
them
to
deduct
from
them
when
they
will
perceive
their
error
explain
that
in
such
a
case
they
must
one
then
say
take
from
placing
balls
on
the
top
wire
borrow
one
from
the
second
and
take
away
eight
and
they
will
see
the
remainder
is
five
and
so
on
through
the
sum
and
others
of
the
same
kind
in
the
lessons
are
performed
as
follows
the
teacher
moves
the
first
ball
and
immediately
after
the
two
balls
on
the
second
wire
placing
them
underneath
the
first
saying
at
the
same
time
twice
one
are
two
which
the
children
will
readily
perceive
we
next
remove
the
two
balls
on
the
second
wire
for
a
multiplier
and
then
remove
two
balls
from
the
third
wire
placing
them
exactly
under
the
first
two
which
forms
a
square
and
then
say
twice
two
are
four
which
every
child
will
discern
for
himself
as
he
plainly
perceives
there
are
no
more
we
then
move
three
on
the
third
wire
and
place
three
from
the
fourth
wire
underneath
them
saying
twice
three
are
six
remove
the
four
on
the
fourth
wire
and
four
on
the
fifth
place
them
as
before
and
say
twice
four
are
eight
remove
five
from
the
fifth
wire
and
five
from
the
sixth
wire
underneath
them
saying
twice
five
are
ten
remove
six
from
the
sixth
wire
and
six
from
the
seventh
wire
underneath
them
and
say
twice
six
are
twelve
remove
seven
from
the
seventh
wire
and
seven
from
the
eighth
wire
underneath
them
saying
twice
seven
are
fourteen
remove
eight
from
the
eighth
wire
and
eight
from
the
ninth
saying
twice
eight
are
sixteen
remove
nine
on
the
ninth
wire
and
nine
on
the
tenth
wire
saying
twice
nine
are
eighteen
remove
ten
on
the
tenth
wire
and
ten
on
the
eleventh
underneath
them
saying
twice
ten
are
twenty
remove
eleven
on
the
eleventh
wire
and
eleven
on
the
twelfth
saying
twice
eleven
are
remove
one
from
the
tenth
wire
to
add
to
the
eleven
on
the
eleventh
wire
afterwards
the
remaining
ball
on
the
twelfth
wire
saying
twice
twelve
are
next
proceed
backwards
saying
times
are
times
are
times
are
for
suppose
you
take
from
the
balls
gathered
together
at
one
end
one
from
each
row
and
place
the
at
the
other
end
thus
making
a
perpendicular
row
of
ones
then
make
four
perpendicular
rows
of
three
each
and
the
children
will
see
there
are
in
divide
the
into
six
parcels
and
they
will
see
there
are
in
leave
only
two
out
and
they
will
see
at
your
direction
that
is
the
sixth
part
of
take
away
one
of
these
and
they
will
see
one
is
the
twelfth
part
of
and
that
are
twelve
to
explain
the
state
of
the
frame
as
it
appears
in
the
cut
we
must
first
suppose
that
the
balls
which
appear
in
four
lots
are
gathered
together
at
the
when
the
children
will
see
there
are
three
perpendicular
and
as
easily
that
there
are
horizontal
if
then
the
teacher
wishes
them
to
tell
how
many
there
are
in
he
moves
them
out
as
they
appear
in
the
cut
and
they
see
there
are
four
and
the
same
principle
is
acted
on
throughout
the
only
remaining
branch
of
numerical
knowledge
which
consists
in
an
ability
to
comprehend
the
powers
of
numbers
without
either
visible
objects
or
signs
is
imparted
as
follows
one
of
the
children
is
placed
before
the
gallery
and
repeats
aloud
in

kind
of

the

each

to
give
an
idea
to
the
reader
the
boy
in

says
ten
shillings
the
half
of
a
pound
six
shillings
and
eightpence
of
a
pound
sixpence
the
half
of
a
shilling
always
remembering
that
whatever
the
boy
says
in
the
rostrum
the
other
children
must
repeat
after
him
but
not
till
the
monitor
has
ended
his
sentence
and
before
the
monitor
delivers
the
second
sentence
he
waits
till
the
children
have
concluded
the
first
they
waiting
for
him
and
he
for
them
this
prevents
confusion
and
is
the
means
of
enabling
persons
to
understand
perfectly
what
is
going
on

that

had
they
used

personal

effort

as
i
have
rarely
seen
a
pirated
one
made
properly
or
understood
i
may
express
a
hope
that
whenever
it
is
wanted
either
for
schools
or
nurseries
application
will
be
made
for
it
to
my
depot
i
have
only
to
add
that
a
board
is
placed
at
the
back
to
keep
the
children
from
seeing
the
balls
except
as
they
are
put
out
and
that
the
brass
figures
at
the
side
are
intended
to
assist
the
master
when
he
is
called
away
so
that
he
may
see
on
returning
to
the
frame
where
he
left
off
the
slightest
glance
at
the
will
shew
how
unjust
the
observations
of
the
writer
of
schools
for
the
industrious
classes
or
the
present
state
of
education
amongst
the
working
people
of
england
published
under
the
superintendance
of
the
central
society
of
education
are
where
he
says
we
are
willing
to
assume
that
wilderspin
has
originated
some
improvements
in
the
system
of
infant
school
education
but
wilderspin
claims
so
much
that
many
persons
have
been
led
to
refuse
him
that
degree
of
credit
to
which
he
is
fairly
entitled
for
example
he
claims
a
beneficial
interest
in
an
instrument
called
the
arithmeticon
of
which
he
says
he
was
the
inventor
this
instrument
was
described
in
a
work
on
arithmetic
published
by
mr
friend
forty
years
ago
the
instrument
is
however
of
much
older
date
it
is
the
same
in
principle
as
the
abacus
of
the
romans
and
in
its
form
resembles
as
nearly
as
possible
the
swanpan
of
the
chinese
of
which
there
is
a
drawing
in
the
encyclopaedia
brittanica
wilderspin
merely
invented
the
name
now
i
defy
the
writer
of
this
to
prove
that
the
arithmeticon
existed
before
i
invented
it
i
claim
no
more
than
what
is
my
due
the
abacus
of
the
romans
is
entirely
different
still
more
so
is
the
chinese
swanpan
if
any
person
will
take
the
trouble
to
look
into
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
they
will
see
the
difference
at
once
although
i
never
heard
of
either
until
they
were
mentioned
in
the
pamphlet
referred
to
there
are
balls
on
mine
and
it
is
properly
simplified
for
infants
with
the
addition
of
the
tablet
which
explains
the
representative
characters
as
well
as
the
real
ones
which
are
the
balls
i
have
not
yet
heard
what
the
central
society
have
invented
probably
we
shall
soon
hear
of
the
mighty
wonders
performed
by
them
from
one
end
of
the
three
kingdoms
to
the
other
their
whole
account
of
the
origin
of
the
infant
system
is
as
partial
and
unjust
as
it
possibly
can
be
simpson
whom
they
quote
can
tell
them
so
as
can
also
some
of
the
committee
of
management
whose
names
i
see
at
the
commencement
of
the
work
the
central
society
seem
to
wish
to
pull
me
down
as
also
does
the
other
society
to
whom
reference
is
made
is
the
same
page
of
which
i
complain
and
i
distinctly
charge
both
societies
with
doing
me
great
injustice
the
society
complains
of
my
plans
without
knowing
them
the
other
adopts
them
without
acknowledgment
and
both
have
sprung
up
after
the
infant
system
had
been
in
existence
many
years
and
i
had
served
three
apprenticeships
to
extend
and
promote
it
without
receiving
subscriptions
or
any
public
aid
whatever
it
is
hard
after
a
man
has
expended
the
essence
of
his
constitution
and
spent
his
children
property
for
the
public
good
in
inducing
people
to
establish
schools
in
the
principal
towns
in
the
three
kingdoms
struck
at
the
root
of
domestic
happiness
by
personally
visiting
each
town
doing
the
thing
instead
of
writing
about
it
that
societies
of
his
own
countrymen
should
be
so
anxious
to
give
the
credit
to
foreigners
verily
it
is
most
true
that
a
prophet
has
no
honour
in
his
own
country
the
first
public
honour
i
ever
received
was
at
inverness
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
last
was
by
the
jews
in
london
and
i
think
there
was
a
space
of
about
twenty
years
between
each

geometry
is
eminently
serviceable
to
improve
and
strengthen
the
intellectual
among
the
novel
features
of
the
infant
school
system
that
of
geometrical
lessons
is
the
most
peculiar
how
it
happened
that
a
mode
of
instruction
so
evidently
calculated
for
the
infant
mind
was
so
long
overlooked
i
can
not
imagine
and
it
is
still
more
surprising
that
having
been
once
thought
of
there
should
be
any
doubt
as
to
its
utility
certain
it
is
that
the
various
forms
of
bodies
is
one
of
the
first
items
of
natural
education
and
we
can
not
err
when
treading
in
the
steps
of
nature
it
is
undeniable
that
geometrical
knowledge
is
of
great
service
in
many
of
the
mechanic
arts
and
therefore
proper
to
be
taught
children
who
are
likely
to
be
employed
in
some
of
those
arts
but
independently
of
this
we
can
not
adopt
a
better
method
of
exciting
and
strengthening
their
powers
of
observation
i
have
seen
a
thousand
instances
moreover
in
the
conduct
of
the
children
which
have
assured
me
that
it
is
a
very
pleasing
as
well
as
useful
branch
of
instruction
the
children
being
taught
the
first
elements
of
form
and
the
terms
used
to
express
the
various
figures
of
bodies
find
in
its
application
to
objects
around
them
an
inexhaustible
source
of
amusement
streets
houses
rooms
fields
ponds
plates
dishes
tables
in
short
every
thing
they
see
calls
for
observation
and
affords
an
opportunity
for
the
application
of
their
geometrical
knowledge
let
it
not
then
be
said
that
it
is
beyond
their
capacity
for
it
is
the
simplest
and
most
comprehensible
to
them
of
all
knowledge
let
it
not
be
said
that
it
is
useless
since
its
application
to
the
useful
arts
is
great
and
indisputable
nor
is
it
to
be
asserted
that
it
is
unpleasing
to
them
since
it
has
been
shewn
to
add
greatly
to
their
happiness
it
is
essential
in
this
as
in
every
other
branch
of
education
to
begin
with
the
first
principles
and
proceed
to
their
application
and
the
complicated
forms
arising
therefrom
the
next
thing
is
to
promote
that
application
of
which
we
have
before
spoken
to
the
various
objects
around
them
it
is
this
and
this
alone
which
forms
the
distinction
between
a
school
lesson
and
practical
knowledge
and
so
far
will
the
children
be
found
from
being
averse
from
this
exertion
that
it
makes
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
a
pleasure
instead
of
a
task
with
these
prefatory
remarks
i
shall
introduce
a
description
of
the
method
i
have
pursued
and
a
few
examples
of
geometrical
lessons
we
will
suppose
that
the
whole
of
the
children
are
seated
in
the
gallery
and
that
the
teacher
provided
with
a
brass
instrument
formed
for
the
purpose
which
is
merely
a
series
of
joints
like
those
to
a
candlestick
from
which
i
borrowed
the
idea
a
and
which
may
be
altered
as
required
in
a
moment
points
to
a
straight
line
asking
what
is
this
a
a
straight
line
q
why
did
you
not
call
it
a
crooked
line
a
because
it
is
not
crooked
but
straight
q
what
are
these
curved
lines
q
what
do
curved
lines
mean
a
when
they
are
bent
or
crooked
q
what
are
these
a
parallel
straight
lines
q
what
does
parallel
mean
a
parallel
means
when
they
are
equally
distant
from
each
other
in
every
part
q
if
any
of
you
children
were
reading
a
book
that
gave
an
account
of
some
town
which
had
twelve
streets
and
it
is
said
that
the
streets
were
parallel
would
you
understand
what
it
meant
a
yes
it
would
mean
that
the
streets
were
all
the
same
way
side
by
side
like
the
lines
which
we
now
see
q
what
are
those
diverging
or
converging
straight
lines
q
what
is
the
difference
between
diverging
and
converging
lines
and
parallel
lines
diverging
or
converging
lines
are
not
at
an
equal
distance
from
each
other
in
every
part
but
parallel
lines
are
q
what
does
diverge
mean
diverge
means
when
they
go
from
each
other
and
they
diverge
at
one
end
and
converge
at
the
other
b
q
what
does
converge
mean
converge
means
when
they
come
towards
each
other
q
suppose
the
lines
were
longer
what
would
be
the
consequence
a
please
sir
if
they
were
longer
they
would
meet
together
at
the
end
they
converge
q
what
would
they
form
by
meeting
together
a
by
meeting
together
they
would
form
an
angle
q
what
kind
of
an
angle
a
an
acute
angle
q
would
they
form
an
angle
at
the
other
end
a
no
they
would
go
further
from
each
other
q
what
is
this
a
a
perpendicular
line
q
what
does
perpendicular
mean
a
a
line
up
straight
like
the
stem
of
some
trees
q
if
you
look
you
will
see
that
one
end
of
the
line
comes
on
the
middle
of
another
line
what
does
it
form
a
the
one
which
we
now
see
forms
two
right
angles
i
will
make
a
straight
line
and
one
end
of
it
shall
lean
on
another
straight
line
but
instead
of
being
upright
like
the
perpendicular
line
you
see
that
it
is
sloping
what
does
it
form
a
one
side
of
it
is
an
acute
angle
and
the
other
side
is
an
obtuse
angle
q
which
side
is
the
obtuse
angle
a
that
which
is
the
most
open
q
and
which
is
the
acute
angle
a
that
which
is
the
least
open
q
what
does
acute
mean
a
when
the
angle
is
sharp
q
what
does
obtuse
mean
a
when
the
angle
is
less
sharp
than
the
right
angle
q
if
i
were
to
call
any
one
of
you
an
acute
child
would
you
know
what
i
meant
a
yes
sir
one
that
looks
out
sharp
and
tries
to
think
and
pays
attention
to
what
is
said
to
him
and
then
you
would
say
he
was
an
acute
child

sic

o

against
ane
at

but
ye
ken
there
was
nane
that
could
tell
the
shape
o
the
thing
that
did
it
a
little
boy
was
watching
his
mother
making
and
wishing
they
were
all
done
when
after
various
observations
as
to
their
comparative
goodness
with
and
without
sugar
he
exclaimed
i
wonder
which
are
best
or
ones
as
this
was
greek
to
the
mother
she
turned
round
with
what
d
say
when
the
child
repeated
the
observation
bless
the
child
said
the
astonished
parent
what
odd
things
ye
are
always
saying
what
can
you
mean
by
liptical
pancakes
why
you
little
fool
do
you
know
they
are
made
of
flour
and
eggs
and
did
you
not
see
me
put
the
milk
into
the
large
pan
and
stir
all
up
together
yes
said
the
little
fellow
i
know
what
they
are
made
of
and
i
know
what
bread
is
made
of
but
that
the
shape
indeed
indeed
mother
they
are
because
they
are
made
in
an
an
old
soldier
who
lodged
in
the
house
was
now
called
down
by
the
mother
and
he
decided
that
the
child
was
right
and
far
from
being
what
in
her
surprize
and
alarm
she
took
him
to
be
on
another
occasion
a
little
girl
had
been
taken
to
market
by
her
mother
where
she
was
struck
by
the
sight
of
the
carcasses
of
six
sheep
recently
killed
and
said
mother
what
are
these
the
reply
was
dead
sheep
dead
sheep
do
bother
they
are
suspended
perpendicular
and
parallels
rejoined
the
child
what
what
was
then
the
question
why
mother
was
the
child
answer
do
you
see
they
hang
up
that
suspended
they
are
straight
up
perpendicular
and
they
are
at
equal
distances
that
parallel
on
another
occasion
a
child
came
crying
to
school
at
having
been
beaten
for
contradicting
his
father
and
begged
of
me
to
go
to
his
father
and
explain
which
i
did
the
man
received
me
kindly
and
told
me
that
he
had
beaten
the
child
for
insisting
that
the
table
which
he
pointed
out
was
not
which
he
repeated
was
against
all
evidence
of
the
senses
that
the
child
told
him
that
if
it
was
round
nothing
would
stand
upon
it
which
so
enraged
him
that
he
thrashed
him
as
he
deserved
and
sent
him
off
to
school
adding
to
be
thus
contradicted
by
a
child
so
young
was
too
bad
the
poor
little
fellow
stood
between
us
looking
the
picture
of
innocence
combined
with
oppression
which
his
countenance
fully
developed
but
said
not
a
word
under
the
said
table
there
happened
to
be
a
ball
left
by
a
younger
child
i
took
it
up
and
kindly
asked
the
man
the
shape
of
it
he
instantly
replied
then
said
i
is
that
table
the
same
shape
as
the
ball
the
man
thought
for
a
minute
and
then
said
it
is
i
then
explained
the
difference
to
him
between
the
one
and
the
other
more
accurately
of
course
than
the
infant
could
and
told
him
as
he
himself
saw
a
distinction
it
was
evident
they
were
not
both
alike
and
told
him
that
the
table
was
circular
ah
said
be
that
is
just
what
the
little
one
said
but
i
did
not
understand
what
circular
meant
but
now
i
see
he
is
right
the
little
fellow
was
so
pleased
that
he
ran
to
his
father
directly
with
delight
the
other
could
not
resist
the
parental
impulse
but
seized
the
boy
and
kissed
him
heartily

it

how

whatever
can
be
shewn
by

should
be
and
i
entreat
teachers
not
to
neglect
this
part
of
their
duty
if
the
tables
be
merely
learnt
the
children
will
be
no
wiser
than
before
another
anecdote
may
be
added
here
to
shew
that
children
even
under
punishment
may
think
of
their
position
with
advantage
doctor
of
manchester
sent
two
of
his
children
to
an
infant
school
for
the
upper
classes
and
one
of
his
little
daughters
had
broken
some
rule
in
conjunction
with
two
other
little
ladies
in
the
same
school
two
of
the
little
folks
were
placed
one
in
each
corner
of
the
room
and
miss
was
placed
in
the
centre
when
the
child
came
home
in
the
evening
doctor
enquired
well
mary
how
have
you
got
on
at
school
to
day
the
reply
was
oh
papa
little
miss
and
fanny
and
i
were
put
out
they
were
put
in
the
corners
and
i
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
there
we
all
stood
papa
a
complete
of
dunces
the
worthy
doctor
took
great
pleasure
in
mentioning
this
anecdote
in
company
as
shewing
the
effect
of
a
judicious
cultivation
of
the
thinking
faculties
in
my
peregrinations
by
sea
and
land
with
infants
we
have
had
some
odd
and
amusing
scenes
i
sometimes
have
had
infants
at
sea
for
several
days
and
nights
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
sailors
i
have
seen
some
of
these
fine
fellows
at
times
in
fits
of
laughter
at
the
odd
words
as
they
called
them
which
the
children
used
at
other
times
i
have
seen
some
of
them
in
tears
at
the
want
of
knowledge
they
saw
in
themselves
and
when
they
heard
the
infants
sing
on
deck
and
explain
the
odd
words
by
things
in
the
ship
the
sailors
were
delighted
to
have
the
youngsters
in
their
berths
and
no
nurse
could
take
better
care
of
them
than
these
noble
fellows
did
i
could
relate
anecdote
after
anecdote
to
prove
the
utility
of
this
part
of
our
system
but
as
it
is
now
more
generally
in
the
training
juvenile
schools
and
becoming
better
known
it
may
not
be
necessary
especially
as
the
prejudice
against
it
is
giving
way
and
the
public
mind
is
better
informed
than
it
was
on
the
subject
and
moreover
it
must
be
given
more
in
detail

on
objects
it
will
shew
how
children
are
taught
the
points
of
the
compass
with
which
we
find
they
are
very
much
delighted
the
best
proof
that
can
be
given
that
it
is
not
injurious
to
the
faculties
sacred
geography
is
of
great
importance
and
children
are
much
pleased
at
finding
out
the
spots
visited
by
our
saviour
or
the
route
of
the
apostle
paul
the
earth
the
earth
on
which
we
all
now
live
is
called
a
globe
its
shape
i
give
if
in
your
pocket
you
a
ball
you
have
it
shape
but
that
not
all
for
land
and
water
it
contains
and
presently
i
give
their
names
the
quarters
are
called
africa
europe
asia
and
america
these
contain
straits
oceans
seas
continents
promontories
islands
rivers
gulfs
or
bays
isthmusses
peninsulas
each
divides
or
separates
nations
kingdoms
cities
states
mountains
forests
hills
and
dales
dreary
deserts
rocks
and
vales
in
forests
deserts
bills
and
plains
where
feet
have
never
trod
there
still
in
mighty
power
he
reigns
an
god
the
cardinal
points
the
is
where
the
sun
does
rise
each
morning
in
the
glorious
skies
full
he
sets
or
hides
his
head
and
points
to
us
the
time
for
bed
he
in
the
at
dinner
time
the
is
facing
to
a
line
the
above
can
be
given
as
a
gallery
lesson
and
it
will
at
once
be
seen
that
it
requires
explanation
the
explanation
is
given
by
the
teacher
in
the
same
way
as
we
have
hinted
at
in
former
lessons
though
for
the
sake
of
those
teachers
who
may
not
be
competent
to
do
it
we
subjoin
the
following
q
little
children
what
have
we
been
singing
about
a
the
earth
on
which
we
live
q
what
is
the

q
what
is
the

q
how
often
does
it
go
round
the
sun
in
a
year
a
once
q
does
it
go
round
anything
else
but
the
sun
a
yes
round
its
own
axis
in
the
same
way
as
you
turn
the
balls
round
on
the
wires
of
the
arithmeticon
q
what
are
these
motions
called

by
its
motion
round
the
sun
a
the
succession
of
summer

and
autumn
which
are
called
the
four
seasons
is
caused
by
this
q
what
is
caused
by
its
daily
motion
round
its
own
axis
a
day
and
night
q
into
what
two
principal
things
is
this
earth
on
which
we
live
divided
a
into
land
and
water

into
how
many
great
parts

divided
a
into
five
q
which
are
they
europe

australia
q
which
part
do
you
live
in
a
in

q
we
sung
that
those
great
parts
contained
straits

rest
with
hills
at
each
side
q
who
made
all
that
we
have
been
speaking
of
almighty
god
i
can
remember
the
time
when
no
national
school
in
england
possessed
a
it
was
thought
dangerous
to
teach
geography
as
in
fact
anything
but
cramming
the
memory
and
reading
and
writing
with
regard
to
the
reading
i
will
say
nothing
as
to
how
much
was
understood
explaining
then
was
out
of
the
question
what
a
change
have
i
lived
to
see
chapter
xv
pictures
and
conversation
religious
instruction
specimens
of
picture
lessons
on
scripture
and
natural
history
other
means
of
religious
instruction
effects
of
religious
instruction
the
parents
of
doddridge
brought
him
up
in
the
early
knowledge
of
religion
before
he
could
read
his
mother
taught
him
the
histories
of
the
old
and
new
testament
by
the
assistance
of
some
dutch
tiles
in
the
chimney
of
the
room
where
they
usually
sat
and
accompanied
her
instructions
with
such
wise
and
pious
reflections
as
make
strong
and
lasting
impressions
upon
his
heart
his
a
footnote
a
this
gave
me
the
idea
of
introducing
scripture
pictures
for
the
infants
and
that
they
are
successful
can
be
vouched
for
by
hundreds
of
teachers
besides
myself
to
give
the
children
general
information
it
has
been
found
advisable
to
have
recourse
to
pictures
of
natural
history
such
as
of
birds
beasts
fishes
flowers
insects
all
of
which
tend
to
shew
the
glory
of
god
and
as
colours
attract
the
attention
of
children
as
soon
as
any
thing
they
eagerly
inquire
what
such
a
thing
is
and
this
gives
the
teacher
an
opportunity
of
instructing
them
to
great
advantage
for
when
a
child
of
his
own
free
will
eagerly
desires
to
be
informed
he
is
sure
to
profit
by
the
information
then
imparted
we
use
also
pictures
of
public
buildings
and
of
the
different
trades
by
the
former
the
children
acquire
much
information
from
the
explanations
which
are
given
to
them
of
the
use
of
buildings
in
what
year
they
were
built
whilst
by
the
latter
we
are
enabled
to
find
out
the
bias
of
a
child
inclination
some
would
like
to
be
shoemakers
others
builders
others
weavers
others
brewers
in
short
it
is
both
pleasing
and
edifying
to
hear
the
children
give
answers
to
the
different
questions
i
remember
one
little
boy
who
said
he
should
like
to
be
a
doctor
and
when
asked
why
he
made
choice
of
that
profession
in
preference
to
any
other
his
answer
was
because
he
should
like
to
cure
all
the
sick
people
if
parents
did
but
study
the
inclinations
of
their
children
a
little
more
i
humbly
conceive
that
there
would
be
more
eminent
men
in
every
profession
than
there
are
it
is
great
imprudence
to
determine
what
business
children
shall
be
of
before
their
tempers
and
inclinations
are
well
known
every
one
is
best
in
his
own
profession
and
this
should
not
be
determined
on
rashly
and
carelessly
but
as
it
is
possible
that
a
person
may
be
very
clever
in
his
business
or
profession
and
yet
not
be
a
christian
it
has
been
thought
necessary
to
direct
the
children
attention
particularly
to
the
scriptures
many
difficulties
lie
in
our
way
the
principal
one
arises
not
from
their
inability
to
read
the
bible
nor
from
their
inability
to
comprehend
it
but
from
the
apathy
of
the
heart
to
its
divine
principles
and
precepts
some
parents
indeed
are
quite
delighted
if
their
children
can
read
a
chapter
or
two
in
the
bible
and
think
that
when
they
can
do
this
they
have
arrived
at
the
summit
of
knowledge
without
once
considering
whether
they
understand
a
single
sentence
of
what
they
read
or
whether
if
they
understand
it
they
its
truth
and
importance
and
how
can
it
be
expected
that
they
should
do
either
when
no
has
been
laid
at
the
time
when
they
received
their
first
impressions
and
imbibed
their
first
ideas
every
one
comes
into
the
world
without
ideas
yet
with
a
capacity
to
receive
knowledge
of
every
kind
and
is
therefore
capable
to
a
certain
extent
of
becoming
intelligent
and
wise
an
infant
would
take
hold
of
the
most
poisonous
reptile
that
might
sting
him
to
death
in
an
instant
or
attempt
to
stroke
the
lion
with
as
little
fear
as
he
would
the
lamb
in
short
he
is
incapable
of
distinguishing
a
friend
from
a
foe
and
yet
so
wonderfully
is
man
formed
by
his
adorable
creator
that
he
is
capable
of
increasing
his
knowledge
and
advancing
towards
perfection
to
all
eternity
without
ever
being
able
to
arrive
at
the
summit
i
am
the
ardent
friend
of
education
but
what
i
thus
denominate
i
must
proceed
to
explain
because
of
the
errors
that
abound
on
this
subject
much
that
bears
the
name
is
altogether
unworthy
of
it
moral
and
religious
sentiments
may
be
written
as
copies
summaries
of
truth
admirable
in
themselves
may
be
deposited
in
the
memory
chapter
after
chapter
too
may
be
repeated
by
rote
and
yet
after
all
the
slightest
salutary
influence
may
not
be
exerted
on
the
mind
or
the
heart
these
may
resemble
the
in
the
parable
on
which
the
fowls
of
the
air
devoured
the
corn
as
soon
as
it
was
sown
and
hence
those
plans
should
be
devised
and
pursued
from
which
we
may
anticipate
a
harvest
of
real
good
on
these
however
my
limits
will
only
allow
a
few
hints
as
soon
as
possible
i
would
have
a
distinction
made
between
the
form
and
power
of
religion
between
the
grimaces
and
so
injurious
to
multitudes
and
that
principle
of
supreme
love
to
god
which
he
alone
can
implant
in
the
heart
i
would
exhibit
too
that
good
will
to
man
which
the
gospel
urges
and
inspires
which
regards
the
human
race
apart
from
all
the
circumstances
of
clime
colour
or
grade
and
which
has
a
special
reference
to
those
who
are
most
necessitous
and
how
can
this
be
done
more
hopefully
than
by
inculcating
in
dependence
on
the
divine
blessing
the
history
sermons
and
parables
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
by
the
simple
affectionate
and
faithful
illustration
and
enforcement
of
other
parts
of
holy
writ
the
infant
system
therefore
includes
a
considerable
number
of
scripture
lessons
of
which
the
following
are
specimens
joseph
and
his
brethren
the
following
method
is
adopted
the
picture
being
suspended
against
the
wall
and
one
class
of
the
children
standing
opposite
to
it
the
master
repeats
the
following
passages
and
joseph
dreamed
a
dream
and
he
told
it
to
his
brethren
and
they
hated
him
yet
the
more
and
he
said
unto
them
hear
i
pray
you
the
dream
which
i
have
dreamed
for
behold
we
were
binding
sheaves
in
the
field
and
lo
my
sheaf
arose
and
also
stood
upright
and
behold
your
sheaves
stood
round
abort
and
made
obeisance
to
my
sheaf
the
teacher
being
provided
with
a
pointer
will
point
to
the
picture
and
put
the
following
questions
or
such
as
he
may
think
better
to
the
children
q
what
is
this
joseph
first
dream
q
what
is
a
dream
a
when
you
dream
you
see
things
during
the
time
of
sleep
q
did
any
of
you
ever
dream
any
thing
here
the
children
will
repeat
what
they
have
dreamed
perhaps
something
like
the
following
please
sir
once
i
dreamed
i
was
in
a
garden
q
what
did
you
see
i
saw
flowers
and
such
nice
apples
q
how
do
you
know
it
was
a
dream
a
because
when
i
awoke
i
found
i
was
in
bed
during
this
recital
the
children
will
listen
very
attentively
for
they
are
highly
pleased
to
hear
each
other
relations
the
master
having
satisfied
himself
that
the
children
in
some
measure
understand
the
nature
of
a
dream
he
may
proceed
as
follows
q
what
did
joseph
dream
about
first
a
he
dreamed
that
his
sheaves
made
obeisance
to
his
sheaf
q
what
is
a
sheaf
a
a
bundle
of
corn
q
what
do
you
understand
by
making
obeisance
a
to
bend
your
body
which
we
call
making
a
bow
q
what
is
binding
sheaves
a
to
bind
them
which
they
do
with
a
band
of
twisted
straw
q
how
many
brothers
had
joseph
eleven
q
what
was
joseph
father
name
jacob
he
is
also
sometimes
called
israel
and
it
is
further
written
concerning
joseph
that
he
dreamed
yet
another
dream
and
told
it
to
his
brethren
and
said
behold
i
have
dreamed
a
dream
more
and
behold
the
sun
and
moon
and
eleven
stars
made
obeisance
to
me
q
what
do
you
understand
by
the
sun
a
the
sun
is
that
bright
object
in
the
sky
which
shines
in
the
and
which
gives
us
heat
and
light
q
who
made
the
sun
almighty
god
q
for
what
purpose
did
god
make
the
sun
a
to
warm
and
nourish
the
earth
and
every
thing
upon
it
q
what
do
you
mean
by
the
earth
a
the
ground
on
which
we
walk
and
on
which
the
corn
trees
and
flowers
grow
q
what
is
it
that
makes
them
grow
a
the
heat
and
light
of
the
sun
q
does
it
require
any
thing
else
to
make
them
grow
a
yes
rain
and
the
assistance
of
almighty
god
q
what
is
the
moon
a
that
object
which
is
placed
in
the
sky
and
shines
in
the
night
and
appears
larger
than
the
stars
q
what
do
you
mean
by
the
stars
a
those
bright
objects
that
appear
in
the
sky
at
night
q
what
are
they
a
some
of

should
we
fear
and
love
him
for
his
goodness
a
yes
and
for
his
mercy
towards
us

do
you
think
it
wonderful

make
all
these

are
wonderful

see
wonders
on
wonders
grandly
rise
and
speak
the
deity
q
who
is
the
deity
almighty
god
nothing
can
be
a
greater
error
than
to
allow
the
children
to
use
the
name
of
god
on
every
trifling
occasion
whenever
it
is
necessary
it
should
in
my
opinion
be
commenced
with
almighty
first
both
by
teacher
and
scholars
i
am
convinced
from
what
i
have
seen
in
many
places
that
the
frequent
repetition
of
his
holy
name
has
a
very
injurious
effect
solomon
wise
judgment
q
what
is
this
a
a
picture
of
solomon
wise
judgment
q
describe
what
you
mean

a
one
said
o
my
lord
give
her
the
living
child

said
let

answered
and
said
give
her
the
living
child
and
in
nowise
slay
it
she
is
the
mother
thereof
q
what
is
meant
by
slaying
a
to
kill
any
thing
q
to
which
woman
was
the
child
given
a
to
the
woman
that
said
do
not
hurt
it
q
what
is
the
reason
that
it
was
called
a
wise
judgment
a
because
solomon
took
a
wise
method
to
find
it
out
q
did
the
people
hear
of
it
a
yes
all
israel
heard
of
it

feared
the

do
judgment
q

when
you
go
from
one
place
to
another
from
london
into
the
country
or
from
the
country
into
london

steal
any
thing
or
take
god
name
in
vain
q
where
will
this
road
lead
to
a
to
eternal
misery
here
we
usually
give
a
little
advice
according
to
circumstances
taking
care
always
to
avoid
long
speeches
that
will
tend
to
stupify
the
children
if
they
appear
tired
we
stop
but
if
not
they
repeat
the
following
hymn
which
i
shall
insert
in
full
as
i
believe

nothing
in
it

any
christian
would
object
to
hark

glory
beams
around

their

the
happy
plains

the
glorious
king
richest
incense
cheerful
bring
praise
and
love
emanuel
name
and
his
boundless
grace
proclaim
the
hymn
being
concluded
we
put
the
following
questions
to
the
children

who
was
the
king
jesus
christ
q
who
are
sinners
a
we
and
all

here
the
teacher
can
inform
the
children
that
jesus
christ
is
called
by
a
variety
of
names
in
the
bible
and
can
repeat
them
to
the
children
if
he
thinks
proper
for
every
correct
idea
respecting
the
saviour
which
he
can
instil
into
their
minds
will
serve
as
a
foundation
for
other
ideas
and
he
will
find
that
the
more
ideas
the
children
have
the
more
ready
they
will
be
in
answering
his
questions
for
man

a
progressive

his
capacity
for
progression

christ
had
cried
softly
lazarus
come
forth
he
would
have
come
and
when
asked
why
they
thought
so
they
have
answered
because
god
can
do
anything
which
is
a
convincing
proof
that
children
at
a
very
early
age
have
an
idea
of
the
omnipotence
of
the
supreme
being
oh
that
men
would
praise
the
lord
for
his
goodness
to
the
children
of
men
picture
of
the
last
supper
q
what
is
this
a
a
picture
of
the
last
supper
q
what
do
you
mean
by
the
last
supper
a
a
sacrament
instituted
by
jesus
christ
himself
q
what
do
you
understand
by
a
sacrament
a
there
are
two
sacraments
baptism
and
the
holy
supper
and
they
are
both
observed
by
true
christians
q
we
will
speak
about
baptism
presently
but
as
we
have
the
picture
of
the
holy
supper
before
as
let
me
ask
if
it
is
called
by
any
other
name
a
yes
it
is
said
that
jesus
kept
the
passover
with
his
disciples
and
when
the
even
was
come
he
sat
down
with
them
and
as
they
did
eat
jesus
took
bread
and
blessed
it
and
brake
it
and
gave
to
his
disciples
saying
take
eat
this
is
my
body
q
what
took
place
next
a
he
took
the
cup
and
when
he
had
given
thanks
he
gave
it
them
saying
this
is
my
blood
the
blood
of
the
new
testament
which
is
shed
for
many
q
did
jesus
command
this
ordinance
to
be
observed
by
his
people
a
yes
he
said
in
another
place
this
do
in
remembrance
of
me
luke
xxii
q
what
ought
those
persons
to
remember
who
do
this
a
they
should
remember
that
jesus
christ
died
on
the
cross
to
save
sinners
q
is
any
thing
else
to
be
understood
by
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
a
yes
a
great
deal
more
q
explain
some
of
it
a
when
they
drink
the
wine
they
should
recollect
that
they
ought
to
receive
the
truth
of
god
into
their
understandings
q
what
will
be
the
effect
of
receiving
the
truth
of
god
into
our
understandings
a
it
will
expel
or
drive
out
all
falsehood
q
what
ought
they
to
recollect
when
they
eat
the
bread
a
they
should
recollect
that
they
receive
the
love
of
god
into
their
wills
and
affections
q
what
will
be
the
effect
of
this
a
it
will
drive
out
all
bad
passions
and
evil
desires
for
it
is
said
he
that
eateth
my
flesh
and
drinketh
my
blood
dwelleth
in
me
and
i
in
him
john
vi
q
is
any
thing
more
to
be
understood
by
these
things
a
much
more
which
we
must
endeavour
to
learn
when
we
get
older
q
how
will
you
learn
this
a
by
reading
the
bible
and
going
to
a
place
of
worship
a
footnote
a
there
are
many
more
of
similar
lessons
and
if
any
thing
more
simple
which
accompany
the
pictures
and
apparatus
which
i
supply
for
infant
schools
the
profits
from
which
will
assist
to
enable
me
if
i
am
blessed
with
health
and
strength
still
further
to
extend
the
system
allow
such
things
as
these
to
be
brought
before
the
infant
mind
let
the
feelings
of
the
heart
as
well
as
the
powers
of
the
understanding
be
called
into
exercise
let
babes
have
the
pure
milk
of
the
word
before
the
strong
meat
let
as
little
stress
as
possible
be
laid
on
the
mere
letter
and
as
much
as
possible
on
the
spirit
of
the
truth
let
it
be
shewn
that
piety
is
not
merely
rational
but
in
the
highest
degree
practicable
let
this
be
done
with
diligence
faith
and
prayer
and
i
hesitate
not
to
say
that
we
shall
have
an
increase
of
the
religion
of
the
religious
instruction
may
be
given
in
other
ways
let
the
teacher
take
a
flower
or
an
insect
and
ask
the
children
if
they
could
make
such
a
one
and
i
never
found
one
who
would
answer
yes
a
microscope
will
increase
the
knowledge
of
its
wonders
the
teacher
may
then
make
a
needle
the
subject
of
remark
the
children
will
admit
that
it
is
smooth
very
smooth
let
him
tell
them
it
is
the
work
of
man
and
as
such
will
appear
imperfect
in
proportion
as
it
is
examined
and
shewing
them
it
through
the
microscope
they
will
perceive
it
is
rough
and
full
of
holes
as
a
contrast
let
him
take
a
bee
obtain
their
observations
on
it
as
it
is
give
them
a
short
history
of
it
and
they
will
acknowledge
its
superiority
over
the
needle
but
on
viewing
it
through
the
microscope
astonishment
will
be
increased
and
i
have
heard
many
say
at
such
a
time
o
sir
how
good
meaning
god
must
be
the
sting
may
then
be
pointed
out
as
the
needle
and
perfectly
smooth
and
thus
truth
may
be
imparted
in
a
manner
the
most
interesting
and
delightful
the
influence
of
such
considerations
on
is
obvious
when
the
of
god
is
spoken
of
allusion
may
be
made
to
our
pride
and
to
the
importance
of
humility
his
may
suggest
the
evil
of
unkindness
and
the
importance
of
benevolence
and
his
may
lead
to
remarks
on
its
necessity
and
the
sin
of
falsehood
a
small
plot
of
ground
may
moreover
be
appropriated
to
the
children
some
grains
of
wheat
barley
or
rye
may
be
sown
and
they
may
be
told
that
at
a
certain
time
they
will
spring
forth
often
will
they
go
and
anxiously
watch
for
this
and
at
length
they
will
say
perhaps
please
sir
such
a
thing
has
come
up
we
know
it
is
so
for
it
is
just
what
you
said
it
would
be
week
after
week
the
progress
of
vegetation
will
be
observed
and
the
fulfilment
of
the
promise
will
greatly
tend
to
increase
influence
so
great
will
appear
that
his
words
and
commands
will
be
more
regarded
while
it
will
be
his
object
to
trace
the
wonders
which
he
predicted
to
their
divine
source
i
have
frequently
observed
on
such
occasions
what
i
should
term
an
act
of
infant
worship
often
has
the
question
been
put
to
me
please
sir
is
it
wicked
to
play
as
if
the
spirit
were
awed
and
transgression
against
god
were
regarded
with
dread
caution
has
been
also
discovered
in
the
use
of
the
divine
name
and
i
have
listened
with
delight
to
such
remarks
as
these
please
sir
when
we
sing
a
hymn
we
may
say
gad
or
if
we
talk
about
the
sun
we
may
say
god
made
it
and
it
is
taking
his
name
in
vain
is
it
but
when
we
talk
of
god
as
boys
do
in
the
street
that
is
very
wicked
the
following
facts
will
illustrate
the
benefit
of
scriptural
instruction
a
little
boy
about
four
years
and
a
half
old
belonging
to
an
infant
school
went
to
see
his
cousin
a
little
girl
about
his
own
age
at
the
little
boy
to
his
great
surprise
saw
her
get
into
bed
without
having
said
her
prayers
the
little
fellow
immediately
went
up
to
the
side
of
the
bed
and
put
this
question
to
her
which
would
you
rather
go
to
heaven
or
hell
the
little
girl
said
i
do
know
not
know
said
the
boy
why
wicked
people
go
to
hell
and
the
good
go
to
heaven
a
happy
place
the
little
girl
then
said
why
i
should
like
to
go
to
heaven
ah
but
replied
the
little
fellow
again
you
did
not
say
your
prayers
and
all
that
go
heaven
pray
to
god
she
then
said
will
you
teach
me
to
pray
your
prayer
if
i
lived
with
you
said
he
i
would
but
if
you
go
to
the
infant
school
they
will
teach
you
to
say
your
prayers
and
sing
hymns
too
one
day
while
the
teacher
of
an
infant
school
was
speaking
to
his
little
children
from
the
conversation
of
our
lord
with
the
woman
of
samaria
at
the
well
a
gentleman
present
asked
the
following
questions
where
should
we
go
to
worship
god
when
a
little
boy
answered
to
a
throne
of
grace
and
where
is
a
throne
of
grace
any
where
answered
the
boy
for
where
we
kneel
down
and
pray
to
god
with
our
hearts
we
are
at
a
throne
of
grace
there
are
times
when
the
children
are
in
a
better
state
to
receive
religious
instruction
than
others
a
teacher
of
observation
will
soon
perceive
this
and
act
accordingly
if
however
the
thing
is
overdone
which
it
may
be
and
which
i
have
seen
then
the
effect
is
fatal
hypocrisy
will
take
the
place
of
sincerity
and
the
heart
will
remain
unaffected
and
unimproved
a
little
boy
the
subject
of
the
following
anecdote
being
six
years
of
age
and
forward
in
his
learning
i
considered
him
fit
to
be
sent
to
another
school
and
informed
the
parents
accordingly
the
father
came
immediately
and
said
he
hoped
i
would
keep
him
till
he
was
seven
years
of
age
adding
that
he
had
many
reasons
for
making
the
request
i
told
him
that
it
was
the
design
of
the
institution
to
take
such
children
as
no
other
school
would
admit
and
as
his
child
had
arrived
at
the
age
of
six
he
would
be
received
into
the
national
school
moreover
as
we
had
a
number
of
applications
for
the
admission
of
children
much
younger
i
could
not
grant
his
request
he
then
said
i
understand
that
you
make
use
of
pictures
in
the
school
and
i
have
good
reason
to
approve
of
them
for
said
he
you
must
know
that
i
have
a
large
bible
in
the
house
matthew
henry
which
was
left
me
by
my
deceased
mother
like
many
more
i
never
looked
into
it
but
kept
it
merely
for
show
the
child
of
course
was
forbidden
to
open
it
for
fear
of
its
being
spoiled
but
still
he
was
continually
asking
me
to
read
in
it
and
i
as
continually
denied
him
indeed
i
had
imbibed
many
unfavourable
impressions
concerning
this
book
and
had
no
inclination
to
read
it
and
was
not
very
anxious
that
the
child
should
however
the
child
was
not
to
be
put
off
although
several
times
i
gave
him
a
box
on
the
ear
for
worrying
me
for
notwithstanding
this
usage
the
child
would
frequently
ask
me
to
read
it
when
he
thought
i
was
in
a
good
humour
and
at
last
i
complied
with
his
wishes
father
said
the
child
you
read
about
solomon
wise
judgment
do
know
where
to
find
it
was
the
reply
says
the
child
will
tell
you
it
is
in
the
third
chapter
of
the
first
book
of
kings
i
looked
as
the
child
directed
and
finding
it
i
read
it
to
him
having
done
so
i
was
about
to
shut
up
the
book
which
the
child
perceiving
said
please
father
will
you
read
about
lazarus
raised
from
the
dead
which
was
done
and
in
short
said
the
father
he
kept
me
at
it
for
at
least
two
hours
that
night
and
completely
tired
me
out
for
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
him
the
next
night
be
renewed
the
application
with
father
will
you
read
about
joseph
and
his
brethren
and
he
could
always
tell
me
where
these
stories
were
to
be
found
indeed
he
was
not
contented
with
my
reading
it
but
would
get
me
into
many
difficulties
by
asking
me
to
explain
that
which
i
knew
nothing
about
and
if
i
said
i
could
not
tell
him
he
would
tell
me
that
i
ought
to
go
to
church
for
his
master
had
told
him
that
that
was
the
place
to
learn
more
about
it
adding
i
will
go
with
you
father
in
short
he
told
me
every
picture
you
had
in
your
school
and
kept
me
so
well
at
it
that
i
at
last
got
into
the
habit
of
for
with
some
degree
of
delight
this
therefore
is
one
reason
why
i
wish
the
child
to
remain
in
the
school
a
short
time
afterwards
the
mother
called
on
me
and
told
me
that
no
one
could
be
happier
than
she
was
for
there
was
so
much
alteration
in
her
husband
for
the
better
that
she
could
scarcely
believe
him
to
be
the
same
man
instead
of
being
in
the
in
the
evening
spending
his
money
and
getting
tipsy
he
was
reading
at
home
to
her
and
his
children
and
the
money
that
used
to
go
for
gambling
was
now
going
to
buy
books
with
which
in
conjunction
with
the
bible
they
were
greatly
delighted
and
afforded
both
him
and
them
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
profit
here
we
see
a
whole
family
were
made
comfortable
and
called
to
a
sense
of
religion
and
duty
by
the
instrumentality
of
a
child
of
six
years
of
age
i
subsequently
made
inquiries
and
found
that
the
whole
family
attended
a
place
of
worship
and
that
their
character
would
bear
the
strictest
investigation
the
following
anecdote
will
also
shew
how
early
impressions
are
made
on
the
infant
mind
and
the
effects
such
impressions
may
have
in
the
dying
moments
of
a
child
a
little
boy
between
the
age
of
five
and
six
years
being
extremely
ill
prevailed
on
his
mother
to
ask
me
to
come
and
see
him
the
mother
called
and
stated
that
her
little
boy
said
be
wanted
to
see
his
master
so
bad
that
he
would
give
any
thing
if
he
could
see
him
the
mother
likewise
said
she
should
herself
be
very
much
obliged
to
me
if
i
would
come
conceiving
that
the
child
would
get
better
after
he
had
seen
me
i
accordingly
went
and
on
seeing
the
child
considered
that
he
could
not
recover
the
moment
i
entered
the
room
the
child
attempted
to
rise
but
could
not
well
my
little
man
said
i
did
you
want
to
see
me
yes
sir
i
wanted
to
see
you
very
much
answered
the
child
tell
me
what
you
wanted
me
for
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
can
not
come
to
school
again
because
i
shall
die
do
say
that
said
the
mother
you
will
get
better
and
then
you
can
go
to
school
again
no
answered
the
child
i
shall
not
get
better
i
am
sure
and
i
wanted
to
ask
master
to
let
my
class
sing
a
hymn
over
my
body
when
they
put
it
in
the
the
child
having
made
me
promise
that
this
should
be
done
observed
you
told
me
master
when
we
used
to
say
the
pictures
that
the
souls
of
children
never
die
and
do
you
think
i
shall
go
to
god
you
ask
me
a
difficult
question
my
little
boy
said
i
is
it
sir
said
the
child
i
am
not
afraid
to
die
and
i
know
i
shall
die
well
child
i
should
not
be
afraid
to
change
states
with
you
for
if
such
as
you
do
not
go
to
god
i
do
not
know
what
will
become
of
such
as
myself
and
from
what
i
know
of
you
i
firmly
believe
that
you
will
and
all
like
you
but
you
know
what
i
used
to
tell
you
at
school
yes
sir
i
do
you
used
to
tell
me
that
i
should
pray
to
god
to
assist
me
to
do
to
others
as
i
would
that
they
should
do
to
me
as
the
hymn
says
and
mother
knows
that
i
always
said
my
prayers
night
and
morning
and
i
used
to
pray
for
father
and
mother
master
and
governess
and
every
body
else
yes
my
little
man
this
is
part
of
our
duty
we
should
pray
for
every
one
and
i
think
if
god
sees
it
needful
he
will
answer
our
prayers
especially
when
they
come
from
the
heart
here
the
child
attempted
to
speak
but
could
not
but
waved
his
hand
in
token
of
gratitude
for
my
having
called
and
i
can
truly
say
that
i
never
saw
so
much
confidence
resignation
and
true
dependence
on
the
divine
will
manifested
by
any
grown
person
on
a
much
less
by
a
child
under
the
tender
age
of
seven
years
i
bade
the
child
adieu
and
was
much
impressed
with
what
i
had
seen
the
next
day
the
mother
called
on
me
and
informed
me
that
the
child
had
quitted
his
tenement
of
clay
and
that
just
before
his
departure
had
said
to
her
and
those
around
him
that
the
souls
of
children
never
die
it
was
only
the
body
that
died
that
he
had
been
told
at
school
while
they
were
saying
the
pictures
that
the
soul
went
to
god
who
gave
it
the
mother
said
that
these
were
the
last
words
the
child
was
known
to
utter
she
then
repeated
the
request
about
the
children
singing
a
hymn
over
his
grave
and
named
the
hymn
she
wished
to
have
sung
the
time
arrived
for
the
funeral
and
the
parents
of
the
children
who
were
to
sing
the
hymn
made
them
very
neat
and
clean
and
sent
them
to
school
i
sent
them
to
the
house
whence
the
funeral
was
to
proceed
and
the
undertaker
sent
word
that
he
could
not
be
troubled
with
such
little
creatures
and
that
unless
i
attended
myself
the
children
could
not
go
i
told
him
that
i
was
confident
that
the
children
would
be
no
trouble
to
him
if
he
only
told
them
to
follow
the
mourners
two
and
two
and
that
it
was
unnecessary
for
any
one
to
interfere
with
them
further
than
shewing
them
the
way
back
to
the
school
i
thought
however
that
i
would
attend
to
see
how
the
children
behaved
but
did
not
let
them
see
me
until
the
corpse
was
arrived
at
the
ground
as
soon
as
i
had
got
to
the
ground
some
of
the
children
saw
me
and
whispered
there
master
when
several
of
them
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
to
favour
me
with
a
bow
when
the
corpse
was
put
into
the
ground
the
children
were
arranged
round
the
grave
not
one
of
whom
was
more
than
six
years
of
age
one
of
them
gave
out
the
hymn
in
the
usual
way
and
then
it
was
sung
by
the
whole
of
them
and
according
to
the
opinions
of
the
very
well
the
novelty
of
the
thing
caused
a
great
number
of
persons
to
collect
together
and
yet
to
their
credit
while
the
children
were
singing
there
was
not
a
whisper
to
be
heard
and
when
they
had
finished
the
hymn
the
poor
people
made
a
collection
for
the
children
on
the
ground
the
minister
himself
rewarded
one
or
two
of
them
and
they
returned
well
stored
with
money
cakes
this
simple
thing
was
the
means
of
making
the
school
more
known
for
i
could
hear
persons
inquiring
where
do
these
children
come
from
why
do
you
know
replied
others
from
the
infant
school
well
answered
a
third
i
will
try
to
get
my
children
into
it
for
i
should
like
them
to
be
there
of
all
things
when
do
they
take
them
in
and
how
do
they
get
them
in
why
you
must
apply
on
monday
mornings
answered
another
and
the
following
monday
i
had
no
less
than
applications
all
of
which
i
was
obliged
to
refuse
because
the
school
was
full
a
footnote
a
this
circumstance
took
place
in
the
heart
of
london
and
some
of
the
chief
actors
in
it
are
now
men
and
women
and
should
this
meet
the
eye
of
any
of
them
i
am
sure
they
will
not
forget
the
circumstances
nor
entirely
forget
their
old
teacher
natural
history
when
teachers
are
conversing
with
their
children
they
should
always
take
care
to
watch
their
countenances
and
the
moment
they
appear
tired
to
stop
an
hour
instruction
when
the
children
minds
and
hearts
are
engaged
is
better
than
many
hours
effort
when
they
are
thinking
of
something
else
in
addition
to
pictures
of
scripture
history
we
have
sixty
of
natural
history
each
picture
having
a
variety
of
quadrupeds
birds
fishes
and
flowers
the
first
thing
we
do
is
to
teach
the
children
the
names
of
the
different
things
then
to
distinguish
them
by
their
forms
and
lastly
they
are
questioned
on
them
as
follows
if
the
animal
is
a
horse
we
put
the
pointer
to
it
and
say
what
is
this
a
a
picture
of
a
horse
q
what
is
the
use
of
the
horse
a
to
draw
carts
coaches
waggons
drays
caravans
the
plough
and
harrow
boats
on
the
canal
and
any
thing
that
their
masters
want
them
q
will
they
carry
as
well
as
draw
a
yes
they
will
carry
a
lady
or
gentleman
on
their
backs
a
sack
of
corn
or
paniers
or
even
little
children
but
they
must
not
hit
them
hard
if
they
do
they
will
fall
off
their
backs
besides
it
is
very
cruel
to
beat
them
q
what
is
the
difference
between
carrying
and
drawing
a
to
carry
is
when
they
have
the
whole
weight
on
their
backs
but
to
draw
is
when
they
pull
any
thing
along
q
is
there
any
difference
between
those
horses
that
carry
and
those
horses
that
draw
a
yes
the
horses
that
draw
carts
drays
stage
waggons
and
other
heavy
things
are
stouter
and
much
larger
and
stronger
than
those
that
carry
on
the
saddle
and
are
called
draught
horses
q
where
do
the
draught
horses
come
from
a
the
largest
comes
from
leicestershire
and
some
come
from
suffolk
which
are
very
strong
and
are
called
suffolk
punches
q
where
do
the
best
come
from
a
they
came
at
first
from
arabia
the
place
in
which
the
camel
is
so
useful
but
now
it
is
considered
that
those
are
as
good
which
are
bred
in
england
q
what
do
they
call
a
horse
when
he
is
young
a
a
foal
or
a
young
colt
q
will
he
carry
or
draw
while
he
is
young
a
not
until
he
is
taught
which
is
called
breaking
of
him
in
q
and
when
he
is
broke
in
is
he
very
useful
a
yes
and
please
sir
we
hope
to
be
more
useful
when
we
are
properly
taught
q
what
do
you
mean
by
being
properly
taught
a
when
we
have
as
much
trouble
taken
with
us
as
the
horses
and
dogs
have
taken
with
them
q
why
you
give
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
yet
i
endeavour
to
teach
you
a
yes
sir
but
before
infant
schools
were
established
little
children
like
us
were
running
the
streets
a
q
but
you
ought
to
be
good
children
if
you
do
run
the
streets
a
please
sir
there
is
nobody
to
tell
us
how
b
and
if
the
man
did
not
teach
the
horse
he
would
not
know
how
to
do
his
work
footnote
a
this
answer
was
given
by
a
child
five
years
of
age
footnote
b
this
answer
was
given
by
a
child
six
years
of
age
here
we
observe
to
the
children
that
as
this
animal
is
so
useful
to
mankind
it
should
be
treated
with
kindness
and
having
questioned
them
as
to
the
difference
between
a
cart
and
a
coach
and
satisfied
ourselves
that
they
understand
the
things
that
are
mentioned
we
close
by
asking
them
what
is
the
use
of
the
horse
after
he
is
dead
to
which
the
children
reply
that
its
flesh
is
eaten
by
other
animals
naming
them
and
that
its
skin
is
put
into
pits
with
oak
bark
which
is
called
tanning
and
that
when
it
is
tanned
it
is
called
leather
and
leather
is
made
into
shoes
to
keep
the
feet
warm
and
dry
and
that
we
are
indebted
to
the
animals
for
many
things
that
we
both
eat
and
wear
and
above
all
to
the
great
god
for
every
thing
that
we
possess
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
this
plan
were
more
generally
adopted
in
all
schools
we
should
not
have
so
many
persons
ascribing
everything
to
blind
chance
when
all
nature
exhibits
a
god
who
guides
protects
and
continually
preserves
the
whole
we
also
examine
the
children
concerning
that
animal
the
ass
and
contrast
it
with
the
beautiful
external
appearance
of
the
zebra
taking
care
to
warn
the
children
not
to
judge
of
things
by
their
outward
appearance
which
the
world
in
general
are
too
apt
to
do
but
to
judge
of
things
by
their
uses
and
of
men
by
their
general
character
and
conduct
after
having
examined
the
children
concerning
the
animals
that
are
most
familiar
to
us
such
as
the
sheep
the
cow
the
dog
and
others
of
a
similar
kind
we
proceed
to
foreign
animals
such
as
the
camel
the
elephant
the
tiger
the
lion
in
describing
the
use
of
the
camel
and
the
elephant
there
is
a
fine
field
to
open
the
understandings
of
the
children
by
stating
how
useful
the
camel
is
in
the
deserts
of
arabia
how
much
it
can
carry
how
long
it
can
go
without
water
and
the
reason
it
can
go
without
water
longer
than
most
other
animals
how
much
the
elephant
can
carry
what
use
it
makes
of
its
trunk
all
these
things
will
assist
the
thinking
powers
of
children
and
enlarge
their
understandings
if
managed
carefully
we
also
contrast
the
beautiful
appearance
of
the
tiger
with
its
cruel
and
disposition
and
endeavour
to
shew
these
men
and
women
in
miniature
that
it
is
a
dangerous
plan
to
judge
of
things
by
outward
appearances
but
that
there
is
a
more
correct
way
of
judging
which
forms
a
part
of
the
business
of
education
to
explain
the
children
are
highly
delighted
with
these
pictures
and
of
their
own
accord
require
an
explanation
of
the
subjects
nay
they
will
even
ask
questions
that
will
puzzle
the
teacher
to
answer
and
although
there
is
in
some
minds
such
a
natural
barrenness
that
like
the
sands
of
arabia
they
are
never
to
be
cultivated
or
improved
yet
i
can
safely
say
that
i
never
knew
a
child
who
did
not
like
the
pictures
and
as
soon
as
i
had
done
explaining
one
it
was
always
please
sir
may
we
learn
this
please
teacher
may
we
learn
that
in
short
i
find
that
i
am
generally
tired
before
the
children
instead
of
having
to
apply
any
magisterial
severity
they
are
petitioning
to
learn
and
this
mode
of
teaching
possesses
an
advantage
over
every
other
because
it
does
not
interfere
with
any
religious
opinion
there
being
no
body
of
christians
that
i
know
or
ever
heard
of
who
would
object
to
the
facts
recorded
in
the
bible
being
thus
elucidated
by
pictures
thus
a
may
be
laid
not
only
of
natural
history
but
of
sacred
history
also
for
the
objects
being
before
the
children
eyes
they
can
in
some
degree
comprehend
them
and
store
them
in
their
memories
indeed
there
is
such
attraction
in
pictures
that
you
can
scarcely
pass
a
in
london
without
seeing
a
number
of
grown
persons
around
the
windows
gazing
at
them
when
pictures
were
first
introduced
into
the
school
the
children
told
their
parents
many
of
whom
came
and
asked
permission
to
see
them
and
although
the
plates
are
very
common
i
observed
a
degree
of
attention
and
reverence
in
the
parents
scarcely
to
be
expected
and
especially
from
those
who
could
not
read
it
is
generally
the
case
that
what
we
have
always
with
us
becomes
so
familiar
that
we
set
little
store
by
it
but
on
being
deprived
of
it
for
a
time
we
then
set
a
greater
value
on
it
and
i
have
found
this
to
be
the
case
with
the
children
if
the
pictures
we
make
use
of
in
the
schools
be
exposed
all
at
once
and
at
all
times
then
there
would
be
such
a
multiplicity
of
objects
before
the
eyes
of
the
children
that
their
attention
would
not
be
fixed
by
any
of
them
they
would
look
at
them
all
at
first
with
wonder
and
surprise
but
in
a
short
time
the
pictures
would
cease
to
attract
notice
and
consequently
the
children
would
think
no
more
of
them
than
they
would
of
the
paper
that
covers
the
room
to
prevent
this
and
to
excite
a
desire
for
information
it
is
always
necessary
to
keep
some
behind
and
to
let
very
few
objects
appear
at
one
time
when
the
children
understand
in
some
measure
the
subjects
before
them
these
may
be
replaced
by
others
and
so
on
successively
until
the
whole
have
been
seen
some
persons
have
objected
to
the
picture
of
christ
being
represented
in
the
human
form
alleging
that
it
is
calculated
to
make
the
children
think
he
was
a
mere
man
only
and
have
thought
it
better
that
be
should
not
be
represented
at
all
the
man
that
undertakes
to
please
all
will
soon
find
out
his
mistake
and
therefore
be
must
do
the
best
he
can
and
leave
the
objectors
to
please
themselves
yet
it
is
a
great
pity
little
children
should
suffer
from
the
objections
of
those
who
can
not
do
better
on
visiting
a
school
take
notice
of
the
pictures
hanging
about
if
they
are
dusty
and
have
not
the
appearance
of
being
be
sure
that
the
committee
have
never
seen
a
good
infant
school
or
that
the
teacher
has
never
been
properly
trained
and
therefore
does
not
know
how
to
use
them

boards
utility
of
this
the
eyes
will
greatly
aid
the
ears
as
i
have
before
said
that
it
is
our
object
to
teach
the
children
from
objects
in
preference
to
books
i
will
mention
a
method
we
adopt
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
purpose
it
consists
of
a
number
of
boards
of
which
and
of
their
use
the
following
description
will
convey
an
accurate
idea
the
boards
are
about
sixteen
inches
square
and
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
wainscot
is
the
best
as
it
does
not
warp
these
will
go
into
the
groove
of
the
lesson
post
there
should
be
about
twenty
articles
on
each
board
or
just
as
it
suits
the
conductors
of
the
school
there
should
be
the
same
quantity
of
things
on
each
board
in
order
that
all
the
children
may
finish
at
one
time
this
will
not
be
the
case
if
there
be
more
objects
on
one
board
than
another
i
will
give
an
account
of
a
few
of
our
boards
and
that
must
suffice
or
i
shall
exceed
the
limits
i
have
prescribed
to
myself
the

of
them

exceedingly
well

very
like

dried

provided
such
as
an
oak
leaf
an
elm

an

the
leaves

should
be
kept

these
will
enable
a
judicious
instructor
to
communicate
a
great
variety
of
valuable
information
on
some
things
connected
with
such
instruction
i
find
i
arrived
at
the
same
conclusions
as
pestalozzi
though
i
have
never
read
his
works
and
for
some
years
after
my
first
efforts
did
not
know
that
such
a
person
existed
i
mean
however
to
give
my
views
on
teaching
by
objects
more
fully
in
a
work
i
hope
soon
to
prepare
to
be
entitled
the
infant
teacher
in
the
nursery
and
the
school
the
utility
of
this
mode
of
teaching
must
be
obvious
for
if
the
children
meet
with
any
of
those
terms
in
a
book
which
they
are
reading
they
them
which
would
not
be
the
case
unless
they
had
seen
the
the
most
intellectual
person
would
not
be
able
to
call
things
by
their
much
less
describe
them
unless
he
had
been
taught
or
heard
some
other
person
call
them
by
their
right
names
and
we
generally
learn
more
by
mixing
with
society
than
ever
we
could
do
at
school
these
sorts
of
lessons
persons
can
make
themselves
and
they
will
last
for
many
years
and
help
to
lay
a
foundation
for
things
of
more
importance
i
am
convinced
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
a
museum
will
be
considered
necessary
to
be
attached
to
every
first
rate
school
for
the
instruction
of
children
sight
is
the
most
direct
inlet
for
knowledge
whatever
we
have
seen
makes
a
much
stronger
impression
upon
us
perception
is
the
first
power
of
mind
which
is
brought
into
action
and
the
one
made
use
of
with
most
ease
and
pleasure
for
this
reason
object
lessons
are
indispensable
in
an
infant
school
consisting
both
of
real
substances
and
of
pictures
the
first
lesson
in
paradise
was
of
this
kind
and
we
ought
therefore
to
draw
instruction
from
it
and
out
of
the
ground
the
lord
god
formed
every
beast
of
the
field
and
every
fowl
of
the
air
and
brought
them
to
adam
to
see
what
he
would
call
them
and
whatsoever
adam
called
every
living
creature
that
was
the
name
of
it

education

with

arithmetical
and

would

infants
happy
give
them
variety
for

has
charms
that
our
minds
can
hardly
withstand
as
an
infant
school
may
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
combination
of
the
school
and
nursery
the
of
forms
a
prominent
part
in
the
system
and
as
little
children
are
very
apt
to
be
fretful
it
becomes
expedient
to
divert
as
well
as
teach
there
if
children
of
two
years
old
and
under
are
not
diverted
they
will
naturally
cry
for
their
mothers
and
to
have
ten
or
twelve
children
crying
in
the
school
it
is
very
obvious
would
put
every
thing
into
confusion
but
it
is
possible
to
have
two
hundred
or
even
three
hundred
children
assembled
together
the
eldest
not
more
than
six
years
of
age
and
yet
not
to
hear
one
of
them
crying
for
a
whole
day
indeed
i
may
appeal
to
the
numerous
and
respectable
persons
who
have
visited
infant
schools
for
the
truth
of
this
assertion
many
of
whom
have
declared
in
my
hearing
that
they
could
not
have
conceived
it
possible
that
such
a
number
of
little
children
could
be
assembled
together
and
all
be
so
happy
as
they
had
found
them
the
greater
part
of
them
being
so
very
young
i
can
assure
the
reader
that
many
of
the
children
who
have
cried
heartily
on
being
sent
to
school
the
first
day
or
two
have
cried
as
much
on
being
kept
at
home
after
they
have
been
in
the
school
but
a
very
short
time
and
i
am
of
opinion
that
when
children
are
absent
it
is
generally
the
fault
of
the
parents
i
have
had
children
come
to
school
without
their
breakfast
because
it
has
not
been
ready
others
have
come
to
school
without
shoes
because
they
would
not
be
kept
at
home
while
their
shoes
were
mending
and
i
have
had
others
come
to
school
half
dressed
whose
parents
have
been
either
at
work
or
gossipping
and
who
when
they
have
returned
home
have
thought
that
their
children
were
lost
but
to
their
great
surprise
and
joy
when
they
have
applied
at
the
school
they
have
found
them
there
need
any
thing
more
be
advanced
than
these
facts
to
prove
that
it
is
not
school
or
the
acquirement
of
knowledge
that
is
disagreeable
to
children
but
the
system
of
injudicious
instruction
there
pursued
children
are
anxious
to
acquire
knowledge
and
nothing
can
be
more
congenial
to
their
taste
than
association
with
those
of
their
own
age
but
we
ought
not
to
wonder
that
little
children
should
dislike
to
go
to
school
when
as
in
most
of
the
dames
schools
forty
or
fifty
or
perhaps
more
are
assembled
together
in
one
room
scarcely
large
enough
for
of
that
number
and
are
not
allowed
to
speak
to
or
scarcely
look
at
each
other
in
those
places
i
firmly
believe
many
for
the
want
of
proper
exercise
become
cripples
or
have
their
health
much
injured
by
being
kept
sitting
so
many
hours
but
as
children
health
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
it
becomes
necessary
to
remedy
this
evil
by
letting
them
have
proper
exercise
combined
as
much
as
possible
with
instruction
to
accomplish
which
many
measures
have
been
tried
but
i
have
found
the
following
to
be
the
most
successful
the
children
are
desired
to
sit
on
their
seats
with
their
feet
out
straight
and
to
shut
each
hand
and
then
ordered
to
count
a
hundred
or
as
many
as
may
be
thought
proper
lifting
up
each
hand
every
time
they
count
one
and
bringing
each
hand
down
again
on
their
knees
when
they
count
another
the
children
have
given
this
the
name
of
blacksmith
and
when
asked
why
they
called
it
blacksmith
they
answered
because
they
hammered
their
knees
with
their
fists
in
the
same
way
as
the
blacksmith
hammers
his
irons
with
a
hammer
when
they
have
arrived
at
hundred
which
they
never
fail
to
let
you
know
by
giving
an
extra
shout
they
may
be
ordered
to
stand
up
and
bring
into
action
the
joints
of
the
knees
and
thighs
they
are
desired
to
add
up
one
hundred
two
at
a
time
which
they
do
by
lifting
up
each
foot
alternately
all
the
children
counting
at
one
time
saying
two
four
six
eight
ten
twelve
and
so
on
by
this
means
every
part
of
the
body
is
put
in
motion
and
it
likewise
has
this
advantage
that
by
lifting
up
each
foot
every
time
they
keep
good
time
a
thing
very
necessary
as
unless
this
was
the
case
all
must
be
confusion
they
also
add
up
three
at
a
time
by
the
same
method
thus
three
six
nine
twelve
fifteen
eighteen
and
so
on
but
care
must
be
taken
not
to
keep
them
too
long
at
one
thing
or
too
long
in
one
position
thus
exercising
the
elbow
joints
by
pushing
them
out
and
drawing
them
back
as
far
as
possible
come
here
my
dear
boy
look
at
baby
two
hands
and
his
two
little
feet
upon
which
baby
stands
two
thumbs
and
eight
fingers
together
make
ten
five
toes
on
each
foot
the
same
number
again
two
arms
and
two
shoulders
two
elbows
two
wrists
now
bind
up
your
knuckles
make
two
little
fists
two
legs
and
two
ancles
two
knees
and
two
hips
his
fingers
and
toes
have
all
nails
on
their
tips
with
his
hands
and
his
feet
he
can
run
jump
and
crawl
he
can
dance
walk
or
caper
or
play
with
his
ball
take
your
hoop
or
your
cart
and
have
a
good
race
and
that
will
soon
give
you
a
fine
rosy
face
oh
what
would
my
boy
do
without
his
two
hands
and
his
two
little
feet
upon
which
baby
stands
they
the
gift
of
kind
heaven
for
you
to
enjoy
then
be
thankful
to
heaven
my
dear
little
boy
having
done
a
lesson
or
two
this
way
they
are
desired
to
put
their
arms
out
straight
and
to
say
one
and
one
are
two
two
and
one
are
three
three
and
one
are
four
four
and
one
are
five
five
and
one
are
six
six
and
two
are
eight
and
in
this
way
they
go
on
until
they
are
desired
to
stop
it
should
be
observed
that
all
actions
may
be
adopted
i
am
sorry
to
find
from
visits
to
various
schools
that
the
movements
of
the
children
have
degenerated
into
buffoonery
they
have
been
allowed
to
put
themselves
into
the
most
ridiculous
postures
and
have
thus
raised
objections
which
would
not
otherwise
have
been
urged
as
however
the
whole
infant
system
is
designed
to
make
the
i
would
urge
the
to
guard
against
their
being
automatons
let
them
mark
every
impropriety
with
promptitude
and
correct
it
with
judgment
i
have
specified
these
methods
not
as
being
the
only
ones
practicable
or
fit
to
be
adopted
but
merely
as
hints
to
the
judicious
teacher
who
will
doubtless
think
of
many
others
conducive
to
the
same
end
and
the
more
he
can
diversify
them
the
better
it
is
the
combination
of
amusement
with
instruction
which
in
my
opinion
renders
the
system
so
successful
and
unimportant
or
improper
even
as
it
may
appear
to
some
is
of
more
real
service
in
the
management
of
young
children
than
all
the
methods
of
restraint
and
coercion
which
have
been
hitherto
but
too
generally
pursued
the
children
may
also
learn
the
pence
and
multiplication
tables
by
forming
themselves
into
circles
around
a
number
of
young
trees
where
such
are
planted
in
the
for
the
sake
of
order
each
class
should
have
its
own
particular
tree
that
when
they
are
ordered
to
the
trees
every
child
may
know
which
tree
to
go
to
as
soon
as
they
are
assembled
around
the
trees
they
are
to
join
hands
and
walk
round
every
child
saying
the
multiplication
table
until
they
have
finished
it
they
then
let
go
hands
and
put
them
behind
and
for
sake
sing
the
pence
table
the
alphabet
hymns
thus
the
children
are
gradually
improved
and
delighted
for
they
call
it
play
and
it
is
of
little
consequence
what
they
call
it
so
long
as
they
are
edified
exercised
and
made
happy
this
plan
is
calculated
to
impress
the
lessons
on
their
memories
and
is
adapted
for
fine
weather
when
they
can
go
out
to
play
as
it
is
called
but
as
in
wet
or
snowy
weather
they
can
not
go
out
of
the
school
we
then
have
recourse
to
the
mode
previously
mentioned
besides
it
is
necessary
that
children
should
have
exercise
in
winter
as
well
as
in
summer
in
wet
as
well
as
in
dry
weather
for
this
purpose
we
have
several
swings
in
the
made
of
cord
only
on
which
the
children
are
allowed
to
swing
two
at
a
time
the
time
that
they
are
permitted
to
be
on
the
swing
is
according
to
what
they
have
to
repeat
if
it
is
the
pence
table
they
say
twenty
pence
are
one
and
eightpence
that
we
ca
afford
to
lose
thirty
pence
are
two
and
sixpence
that
will
buy
a
pair
of
shoes
forty
pence
are
three
and
fourpence
that
is
paid
for
certain
fees
fifty
pence
are
four
and
twopence
that
will
buy
five
pounds
of
cheese
sixty
pence
will
make
five
shillings
which
we
learn
is
just
a
crown
seventy
pence
are
five
and
tenpence
this
is
known
throughout
the
town
eighty
pence
are
six
and
eightpence
i
always
try
to
think
of
that
ninety
pence
are
seven
and
sixpence
this
will
buy
a
beaver
hat
a
hundred
pence
are
eight
and
fourpence
which
is
taught
in
th
infant
school
eight
pence
more
make
just
nine
shillings
so
we
end
this
pretty
rule
a
footnote
a
a
covered
is
desirable
where
practicable
as
soon
as
the
table
is
thus
gone
through
the
children
who
are
on
the
swings
get
off
and
others
supply
their
places
until
probably
the
pence
table
has
been
said
twenty
times
then
we
go
on
with
the
multiplication
table
until
the
children
have
repeated
as
far
as
six
times
six
are
when
the
children
on
the
swings
get
off
and
are
succeeded
by
two
more
on
each
swing
they
then
commence
the
other
part
of
the
table
beginning
at
six
times
seven
are
until
they
have
finished
the
table
during
this
time
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
all
the
children
are
learning
not
only
those
on
the
swings
but
those
who
are
sitting
in
the
school
and
it
is
surprising
to
see
with
what
alacrity
the
children
will
dispatch
their
other
lessons
when
it
is
a
wet
day
in
order
to
get
to
the
swings
in
addition
to
the
knowledge
acquired
by
this
method
it
is
admirably
calculated
to
try
their
courage
many
little
boys
and
girls
who
at
first
are
afraid
to
get
on
the
swings
will
soon
swing
standing
on
one
leg
and
perform
other
feats
with
the
greatest
dexterity
at
once
showing
their
increased
courage
and
greater
activity
we
generally
let
four
or
five
children
come
to
a
swing
and
those
that
can
seat
themselves
first
are
entitled
to
the
first
turn
for
they
are
never
lifted
on
in
the
anxiety
to
get
on
the
swing
some
of
them
will
perhaps
get
out
of
temper
especially
those
who
are
not
disciplined
but
when
this
is
detected
they
are
not
allowed
to
swing
that
day
which
soon
makes
them
to
each
other
and
very
cautious
not
to
get
into
a
passion
thus
in
some
degree
their
bad
tempers
are
corrected
which
is
very
desirable
it
is
a
current
remark
that
bad
workmen
find
fault
with
the
tools
and
lazy
teachers
find
fault
with
the
swings
because
they
must
perpetually
watch
the
children
we
are
so
tinctured
with
the
old
plan
of
the
children
to
that
i
despair
of
ever
seeing
the
opposite
plan
become
general
in
my
time
as
soon
as
two
children
are
seated
on
each
swing
to
preserve
order
the
others
retire
generally
speaking
in
the
greatest
good
humour
to
their
seats
some
will
i
know
be
apt
to
exclaim
surely
this
is
encouraging
and
fostering
bad
feelings
creating
enmity
and
amongst
the
children
but
i
say
no
it
is
teaching
them
to
feel
a
spirit
of
generous
emulation
as
distinguishable
from
that
of
or
envy
beside
the
swings
in
many
schools
they
have
a
very
useful
addition
to
the
i
mean
the
gymnastic
pole
although
it
is
most
proper
for
the
master
in
the
to
relax
altogether
the
brow
of
magisterial
severity
yet
there
is
no
occasion
for
him
to
withdraw
the
influence
of
love
he
will
not
prove
a
check
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
children
if
entering
into
the
spirit
of
their
innocent
pastimes
he
endeavours
to
heighten
their
pleasures
by
a
judicious
direction
of
their
sports
among
other
amusements
which
his
ingenuity
may
suggest
i
would
mention
a
geometrical
amusement
which
is
very
practicable
first
let
a
certain
number
of
children
stand
in
a
row
opposite
to
these
let
one
or
more
children
be
placed
as
directors
to
order
the
change
of
figure
a
straight
line
we
will
suppose
is
the
first
thing
shown
by
the
position
of
the
children
the
next
thing
to
be
formed
is
a
by
the
advancement
of
each
end
then
a
a
circle
by
joining
hands
in
a
ring
two
equal
parallel
lines
by
the
division
of
the
number
in
action
next
a
square
triangle
these
changes
may
either
be
made
at
the
command
of
the
master
or
as
we
before
proposed
of
one
or
more
children
acting
as
officers
to
direct
these
geometrical
movements
had
it
been
constantly
borne
in
memory
that
god
is
the
creator
of
the
body
of
a
child
as
well
as
of
its
mind
and
that
the
healthy
action
of
both
is
requisite
for
happiness
and
usefulness
more
attention
would
have
been
paid
to
the
due
and
proper
exercise
of
children
than
has
hitherto
been
done
he
has
implanted
an
instinctive
impulse
to
activity
in
every
young
child
which
displays
itself
in
almost
incessant
motion
where
there
is
perfect
health
and
when
there
is
opportunity
to
restrain
this
unnecessarily
is
therefore
to
act
in
opposition
to
the
laws
of
nature
and
the
end
must
be
a
certain
injury
to
the
child
to
prevent
this
evil
and
to
act
in
obedience
to
these
laws
the
various
actions
of
clapping
the
hands
folding
the
arms
twisting
the
fists
and
various
other
motions
have
been
introduced
by
these
means
a
spirit
of
restlessness
which
would
undoubtedly
show
itself
under
unnecessary
restraints
is
converted
into
a
motive
of
obedience
and
thus
even
a
moral
influence
is
produced
by
what
would
appear
a
mere
childish
play
they
may
all
be
gone
through
with
elegance
and
propriety
and
no
rude
or
indelicate
action
should
be
allowed
many
masters
are
too
free
in
making
a
show
of
these
exercises
to
visitors
who
are
perhaps
amused
with
them
but
this
is
to
divert
them
from
their
proper
use
they
were
only
invented
to
be
introduced
at
intervals
when
the
children
attention
began
to
flag
or
to
give
them
that
proper
exercise
which
their
tender
age
required
how
has
everything
connected
with
the
infant
system
been
burlesqued
and
thus
sensible
persons
have
been
led
to
despise
infant
education
which
if
rightly
understood
by
them
would
be
seen
to
be
one
of
the
most
powerful
moral
engines
that
can
be
put
into
action
for
the
welfare
of
our

of
the
poorer
classes

in

illustrative
music
hath

music
has
been
found
a
most
important
means
of
and
improvement
its
application
took
place
from
my
finding
a
great
difficulty
in
teaching
some
children
especially
the
younger
ones
to
sound
their
letters
and
hence
i
determined
to
set
the
alphabet
to
a
simple
tune
i
sang
it
frequently
to
the
children
when
they
were
low
or
dispirited
and
although
none
attempted
the
same
sounds
at
first
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
observing
unusual
attention
my
next
effort
was
very
injudicious
for
i
urged
on
them
the
imitation
of
these
sounds
before
they
were
actually
capable
of
so
doing
and
hence
as
more
reflection
would
have
shewn
only
discordance
arose
having
told
them
then
to
listen
as
they
did
at
first
i
soon
discovered
that
having
learned
the
tune
through
the
proper
organ
the
ear
they
were
able
to
imitate
it
with
the
voice
we
then
by
the
same
means
marked
the
distinction
between
vowels
and
consonants
with
a
tune
that
was
longer
and
rather
more
difficult
as
the
monitor
always
pointed
out
the
letters
in
succession
while
the
children
were
singing
attention
was
excited
and
secured
and
error
effectually
prevented
as
correct
time
and
tune
could
not
be
kept
unless
every
child
sung
the
right
letter
success
as
to
the
alphabet
led
to
the
adoption
of
music
in
the
teaching
of
arithmetic
this
was
available
in
two
ways
first
by
combining
with
it
physical
exercise
and
then
by
tasking
the
faculties
of
observation
the
former
was
effected
as
follows
the
children
sang
one
is
the
half
of
two
two
is
the
half
of
four
three
is
the
half
of
six
and
then
brought
one
hand
down
on
the
other
alternately
without
however
making
too
much
noise
so
as
to
interrupt
the
time
the
latter
was
accomplished
by
the
arithmeticon
which
has
already
been
explained
a
few
specimens
of
the
ditties
thus
used
shall
now
be
given
and
several
others
both
hymns
and
moral
songs
are
to
be
found
in
the

recently
published

myself

conjunction
with
a

four

life
our
days
four
seasons
are
at
most
and
infancy
the
time
of
spring
oh
with
what
trouble
care
and
cost
must
we
be
taught
to
pray
and
sing
in
summer
as
our
growth
proceeds
good
fruit
should
hang
on
every
branch
our
roots
be
clear
from
evil
weeds
as
into
knowledge
we
advance
our
autumn
is
the
season
when
temptations
do
our
minds
assail
our
fruits
are
proved
in
manhood
then
let
not
sin
death
and
hell
prevail
for
winter
brings
old
age
and
death
if
we
good
fruits
laid
up
in
store
soon
as
we
gasp
our
latest
we
land
on
a
four
seasons
of
the
year
on
march
the
is
spring
when
little
birds
begin
to
sing
begin
to
build
and
hatch
their
brood
and
carefully
provide
them
food
summer
the

the

then
his

all

the

september
on
the

sportsmen

autumn
comes
in
the
fields
are
shorn
the

the

mention

in

must
fix
for

five

all
human
beings
must

birds
and
beasts
to
be
complete
five
senses
have
at
least
the
sense
of
hearing
to
the

confined
the
eye
we
know
for
seeing
is

nose

part
while

gives

beating

the
master
daily
advice
to
his
school
if
you
in
wisdom
ways
proceed
you
intellectual
knowledge
need
let
science
be
your
guiding
star
or
from
its
path
you
wander
far
is
science
that
directs
the
mind
the
path
of
happiness
to
find
if
added
is
to
bring
reward
to
every
youth
the
good
children
all
pence
by
the
generous
deposited
here
when
holidays
come
i
will
equally
share
among
all
good
children
attending
this
school
i
should
wish
not
to
find
a
dunce
or
a
fool
then
listen
all
you
who
a
prize
hope
to
gain
attend
to
your
books
and
you
not
hope
in
vain
the
master
the
cow
come
children
listen
to
me
now
and
you
shall
hear
about
the
cow
you
find
her
useful
live
or
dead
whether
she
black
or
white
or
red
when
milk
her
morn
and
night
she
gives
them
milk
so
fresh
and
white
and
this
we
little
children
think
is
very
nice
for
us
to
drink
the
curdled
milk
they
press
and
squeeze
and
so
they
make
it
into
cheese
the
cream
they
skim
and
shake
in
churns
and
then
it
soon
to
butter
turns
and
when
she
dead
her
flesh
is
good
for
is
our
true
english
food
but
though
make
us
brave
and
strong
to
eat
too
much
we
know
is
wrong
her
skin
with
lime
and
bark
together
the
tanner
tans
and
makes
it
leather
and
without
what
should
we
do
for
soles
to
every
boot
or
shoe
the
shoemaker
cuts
it
with
his
knife
and
bound
the
tops
are
by
his
wife
and
then
he
nails
it
to
the
last
and
after
sews
it
tight
and
fast
the
hair
that
grows
upon
her
back
is
taken
whether
white
or
black
and
mix
with
mortar
short
or
long
which
makes
it
very
firm
and
strong
the
spreads
it
with
a
tool
and
this
you
find
is
just
the
rule
and
when
he
spread
it
tight
and
fast
i
sure
it
many
years
will
last
and
last
of
all
if
cut
with
care
her
horns
make
combs
to
comb
our
hair
and
so
we
learn
thanks
to
our
teachers
that
cows
are
good
and
useful
creatures
the
sheep
hark
now
to
me
and
silence
keep
and
we
will
talk
about
the
sheep
for
sheep
are
harmless
and
we
know
that
on
their
backs
the
wool
does
grow
the
sheep
are
taken
once
a
year
and
plunged
in
water
clean
and
clear
and
there
they
swim
but
never
bite
while
men
do
wash
them
clean
and
white
and
then
they
take
them
fat
or
lean
clip
off
the
wool
both
short
and
clean
and
this
is
call
we
understand
shearing
the
sheep
throughout
the
land
and
then
they
take
the
wool
so
white
and
pack
it
up
in
bags
quite
tight
and
then
they
take
those
bags
so
full
and
sell
to
men
that
deal
in
wool
the
wool
is
wash
and
comb
with
hand
then
it
is
spun
with
wheel
and
band
and
then
with
shuttle
very
soon
wove
into
cloth
within
the
loom
the
cloth
is
first
sent
to
be
dyed
then
it
is
wash
and
press
and
dried
the
tailor
then
cuts
out
with
care
the
clothes
that
men
and
boys
do
wear
the
horse
come
children
let
us
now
discourse
about
the
pretty
noble
horse
and
then
you
soon
will
plainly
see
how
very
useful
he
must
be
he
draws
the
coach
so
fine
and
smart
and
likewise
drags
the
loaded
cart
along
the
road
or
up
the
hill
though
then
his
task
is
harder
still
upon
his
back
men
ride
with
ease
he
carries
them
just
where
they
please
and
though
it
should
be
many
a
mile
he
gets
there
in
a
little
while
with
saddle
on
his
back
they
sit
and
manage
him
with
reins
and
bit
the
whip
and
spur
they
use
also
when
they
would
have
him
faster
go
and
be
the
weather
cold
or
hot
as
they
may
wish
he
walk
or
trot
or
if
to
make
more
haste
they
need
will
gallop
with
the
greatest
speed
when
dead
his
shining
skin
they
use
as
leather
for
our
boots
and
shoes
alive
or
dead
then
thus
we
see
how
useful
still
the
horse
must
be
the
dog
the
cow
the
sheep
the
horse
have
long
been
made
the
subject
of
our
song
but
there
are
many
creatures
yet
whose
merits
we
must
not
forget
and
first
the
dog
so
good
to
guard
his
master
cottage
house
or
yard
dishonest
men
away
to
keep
and
guard
us
safely
while
we
sleep
for
if
at
midnight
still
and
dark
strange
steps
he
hears
with
angry
bark
he
bids
his
master
wake
and
see
if
thieves
or
honest
folks
they
be
at
home
abroad
obedient
still
his
only
guide
his
master
will
before
his
steps
or
by
his
side
he
runs
or
walks
with
joy
and
pride
he
runs
to
fetch
the
stick
or
ball
returns
obedient
to
the
call
content
and
pleased
if
he
but
gains
a
single
pat
for
all
his
pains
but
whilst
his
merits
thus
we
praise
pleased
with
his
character
and
ways
this
let
us
learn
as
well
we
may
to
love
our
teachers
and
obey
moral
lesson
a
footnote
a
the
following
tale
though
not
adapted
for
the
younger
children
of
an
infant
school
and
too
long
to
be
committed
to
memory
by
the
elder
ones
might
be
read
to
such
by
the
master
and
would
serve
as
an
admirable
theme
for
conversation
it
is
likewise
well
adapted
as
a
tale
for
family
circles
the
two
halves
what
nice
said
james
to
john
our
mother
sends
is
your
all
gone
it
is
john
answered
is
not
thine
no
john
i
saved
one
half
of
mine
it
was
so
large
as
well
as
nice
i
thought
that
it
should
serve
for
twice
had
i
eat
all
i
might
have
mourn
such
haste
in
sorrow
so
half
my
cake
i
wisely
took
and
seated
in
my
favourite
nook
enjoyed
alone
the
of
present
and
of
future
treasure
i
too
said
john
made
up
my
mind
this
morning
when
our
mother
kind
sent
down
the
cakes
so
nice
and
sweet
that
i
but
half
would
eat
and
half
i
ate
the
other
half
james
stopp
his
brother
with
a
laugh
i
know
what
you
about
to
say
the
other
half
you
gave
away
now
brother
pray
explain
to
me
the
charms
which
you
in
see
shew
me
how
foes
or
friends
can
for
your
make
amends
a
poor
old
man
said
john
came
by
whose
looks
implored
for
charity
his
eyes
bedimm
with
starting
tears
his
body
bowed
by
length
of
years
his
feeble
limbs
his
hoary
hairs
were
to
my
heart
as
silent
prayers
i
saw
too
he
was
hungry
though
his
lips
had
not
informed
me
so
to
this
poor
creature
james
i
gave
the
half
which
i
had
meant
to
save
the
lingering
tears
with
sudden
start
ran
down
the
furrows
of
his
cheek
i
knew
he
thank
me
in
his
heart
although
he
strove
in
vain
to
speak
the
joy
that
from
such
acts
we
gain
i
try
for
your
sake
to
explain
first
god
is
pleased
who
as
you
know
marks
every
action
that
we
do
that
god
whom
all
blessings
flow
so
many
james
to
me
and
you
next
had
she
but
seen
her
gifts
of
kindness
so
employ
would
not
james
well
pleased
have
been
and
all
my
feelings
then
enjoy
poor
old
was
not
pleased
must
not
his
load
of
sorrow
be
though
but
for
one
short
moment
eased
to
think
some
one
feels
for
me
but
still
you
ask
of
all
this
pleasure
how
much
will
to
fall
the
whole
rich
undiminish
treasure
feels
shares
the
joy
of
we
eat
the
cake
and
it
is
gone
what
have
we
left
to
think
upon
who
pleased
by
what
we
then
have
done
how
many
pray
james
more
than
one
the
joys
by
sympathy
supplied
are
many
great
and
dignified
but
do
not
on
my
word
rely
whilst
you
dear
james
the
fact
may
try
and
if
you
do
not
find
it
true
i
next
time
eat
with
you
it
is
desirable
that
the
master
should
add
instrumental
to
vocal
music
he
should
be
able
to
play
on
the
violin
flute
or
clarionet
but
as
he
must
speak
much
the
former
is
to
be
preferred
such
is
the
influence
of
the
weather
that
children
are
almost
always
dull
on
dull
days
and
then
a
little
music
is
of
great
advantage
on
wet
days
when
they
can
not
go
into
the
it
assists
them
in
keeping
the
step
when
they
march
it
cheers
and
animates
their
spirits
and
in
some
measure
compensates
for
their
privations
it
will
also
aid
various
evolutions
music
may
be
employed
moreover
to
soften
the
feelings
curb
the
passions
and
improve
the
temper
and
it
is
strange
that
it
should
not
have
been
employed
till
the
operation
of
the
infant
system
to
which
it
is
absolutely
indispensable
when
for
instance
after
a
trial
by
jury
as
explained
in
a
former
page
the
children
have
been
disposed
to
harshness
and
severity
a
soft
and
plaintive
melody
has
produced
a
different
decision
to
recite
one
case
when
i
was
organizing
the
school
in
glasgow
a
a
little
girl
in
the
gallery
had
lost
of
her
which
by
the
way
like
beads
is
a
very
improper
appendage
and
ought
by
all
means
to
be
discouraged
and
on
discovering
the
fact
commenced
a
most
piteous
lamentation
i
made
inquiry
for
it
immediately
while
the
children
were
seated
in
the
gallery
but
in
vain
and
i
subsequently
found
it
in
the
hands
of
a
little
girl
at
the
bottom
who
was
attentively
examining
it
and
who
gave
it
me
the
moment
it
was
demanded
on
asking
the
children
what
was
to
be
done
in
this
case
they
said
she
should
have
a
pat
of
the
hand
i
then
showed
that
had
she
intended
to
steal
it
she
would
have
secreted
it
which
she
did
not
and
that
her
attention
was
so
absorbed
by

one
little
boy
was
not

he
said

kenned
right

it

after
singing

i
was
pleased
to
find
his
opinion
changed

sir
he
said
ye

footnote
a
this
school
has
since
become
a
very
important
normal
school
from
which
many
others
have
emanated
the
head
master
being
the
one
i
originally
instructed
stowe
also
one
of
the
directors
has
applied
the
principles
of
the
infant
school
system
to
the
instruction
of
older
children
which
is
called
stowe
training
system
being
applied
to
juveniles
with
great
success
i
know
of
no
school
except
the
dublin
normal
schools
equal
to
those
and
of
no
masters
superior
to
those
i
have
seen
who
have
been
taught
there
the
music
chosen
for
children
should
be
easy
and
simple
fluent
and
varied
hymn
tunes
should
be
of
a
rather
lively
character
as
the
more
dull
and
sombrous
are
not
well
adapted
to
the
infant
ear
airs
for
the
tables
or
exercising
songs
are
required
to
be
very
cheerful
and
inspiring
and
then
they
tend
to
excite
pleasure
and
liveliness
which
should
often
be
aimed
at
in
an
infant
school
as
children
take
much
interest
in
singing
and
readily
learn
verses
by
heart
so
as
to
sing
them
although
not
properly
instructed
in
their
meaning
or
rightly
understanding
them
singing
has
been
considered
by
many
persons
the
soul
of
the
system
this
is
a
grievous
error
as
regards
the
intellectual
advancement
of
the
children
and
still
worse
as
regards
their
health
and
that
of
the
teacher
i
have
at
times
entered
schools
as
a
visitor
when
the
mistress
has
immediately
made
the
children
show
off
by
singing
in
succession
a
dozen
pieces
as
if
they
were
a
musical
box
thus
to
sing
without
bounds
is
a
very
likely
way
to
bring
the
mistress
to
an
early
grave
and
injure
the
lungs
of
the
dear
little
children
use
as
not
abusing
is
the
proper
rule
tar
all
the
new
modes
of
teaching
and
amusing
children
that
i
have
introduced
but
it
has
often
appeared
to
me
that
abuse
it
as
much
as
possible
was
the
rule
acted
upon
call
upon
the
first
singers
of
the
day
to

chapter
xix
grammar
of
instruction
grammatical
a
few
months
ago
gave
his
little
daughter
h
a
child
of
five
years
old
her
first
lesson
in
english
grammar
but
no
alarming
book
of
grammar
was
produced
on
the
occasion
nor
did
the
father
put
on
an
unpropitious
gravity
of
countenance
he
explained
to
the
smiling
child
the
nature
of
a
verb
a
pronoun
and
a
it
has
been
well
observed
that
grammar
is
the
first
thing
taught
and
the
last
learnt
now
though
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
pretend
that
i
can
so
far
simplify
grammar
as
to
make
all
its
rules
comprehensible
to
children
so
young
as
those
found
in
infant
schools
i
do
think
that
enough
may
be
imparted
to
them
to
render
the
matter
more
comprehensible
than
it
is
usually
found
to
be
in
after
years
the
great
mystery
of
grammar
results
in
my
opinion
from
not
making
the
children
acquainted
with
the
things
of
which
the
words
used
are
the
signs
and
moreover
from
the
use
of
a
number
of
hard
words
which
the
children
repeat
without
understanding
for
instance
in
the
classification
of
words
or
the
parts
of
speech
as
they
are
called
and
convey
as
terms
no
idea
to
the
minds
of
children
and
in
spite
of
the
definitions
by
which
their
import
is
explained
remain
to
them
as
unintelligible
as
the
language
of
magical
incantation
that
the
children
can
easily
comprehend
the
difference
between
words
which
express
the
names
of
things
and
those
which
express
their
qualities
and
between
words
which
express
actions
and
those
which
express
the
nature
of
those
actions
is
undeniable
and
this
is
just
what
should
be
taught
in
an
infant
school
in
the
first
place
let
the
children
be
accustomed
to
repeat
the
names
of
things
not
of
any
certain
number
of
things
set
down
on
a
lesson
card
or
in
a
book
but
of
any
thing
and
every
thing
in
the
next
let
them
be
exercised
in
telling
something
relating
to
those
things
as
for
instance
the
is
the
children
are
good
the
pictures
are
the
is
having
accustomed
the
children
in
this
manner
first
to
give
you
the
of
things
and
then
to
observe
and
repeat
something
respecting
them
you
have
gained
two
ends
you
have
first
taught
the
children
to
be
observant
and
discriminative
and
secondly
you
have
taught
them
to
distinguish
two
distinct
classes
of
words
or
and
and
you
may
now
if
you
please
give
them
terms
by
which
to
distinguish
these
respective
classes
viz
and
they
will
no
longer
be
mysterious
words
signifying
nothing
but
recognized
signs
by
which
the
children
will
understand
and
express
definite
ideas
the
next
thing
you
have
to
teach
them
is
the
distinction
betwixt
singular
and
plural
and
if
you
think
proper
masculine
and
feminine
but
before
you
talk
to
the
children
about
and
let
them
be
made
acquainted
with
the
realities
of
which
these
words
are
the
signs
having
made
the
classification
of
words
clear
and
comprehensible
you
next
proceed
to
the
second
grand
class
of
words
the
verbs
and
their
adjuncts
the
with
these
you
will
proceed
as
with
the
former
let
action
be
distinguished
by
words
the
children
play
read
eat
master
frowns
speaks
and
so
on
letting
the
children
find
their
own
examples
then
comes
the
demand
from
the
master
for
words
expressing
the
manner
of
action
how
do
the
children
slowly
quickly
how
do
they
eat
run
how
does
the
master
speak
sing
the
children
now
find
you
adverbs
and
it
will
be
quite
time
enough
to
give
them
terms
for
the
classification
they
thus
intuitively
make
when
they
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
they
are
doing
when
this
end
is
attained
your
children
have
some
ideas
of
grammar
and
those
clear
ones
there
is
no
occasion
to
stop
here
proceed
but
slowly
and
in
the
same
method
the
tenses
of
the
verbs
and
the
subdivision
into
active
passive
and
neuter
will
require
the
greatest
care
and
attention
which
the
teacher
can
use
to
simplify
them
sufficiently
for
the
comprehension
as
it
will
likewise
enable
them
to
understand
the
nature
and
office
of
the
other
classes
of
words
as
however
it
is
not
my
intention
to
write
a
grammar
here
but
merely
to
throw
out
a
few
hints
on
the
subject
i
shall
leave
the
further
development
of
the
plan
to
the
ingenuity
of
those
who
may
think
fit
to
adopt
its
principles
as
above
laid
down
english
grammar
doth
us
teach
that
it
hath
nine
parts
of
speech
article
adjective
and
noun
verb
conjunction
and
pronoun
with
preposition
and
adverb
and
interjection
as
i
heard
the
letters
are
just
these
form
all
words
when
rightly
mix
the
vowels
are
a
e
o
i
with
u
and
sometimes
w
and
y
without
the
little
vowels
aid
no
word
or
syllable
is
made
but
consonants
the
rest
we
call
and
so
of
these
we
mention
all
three
little
words
we
often
see
are
articles
and
a
noun
the
name
of
any
thing
as
or
hoop
or
adjectives
tell
the
kind
of
noun
as
small
pretty
white
or
instead
of
nouns
the
pronouns
stand
john
head
face
arm
hand
verbs
tell
of
something
being
done
to
write
count
sing
or
how
things
are
done
the
adverbs
tell
as
quickly
or
conjunctions
join
the
nouns
together
as
men
children
wind
weather
a
preposition
stands
before
a
noun
as
or
a
door
the
interjection
shows
surprise
as
how
pretty
how
wise
the
whole
are
called
nine
parts
of
speech
which
reading
writing
speaking
teach
the
articles
three
little
words
we
hear
and
see
in
frequent
use
and
these
words
so
useful
though
so
small
are
those
which
articles
we
call
the
first
two
and
we
use
when
speaking
of
one
thing
alone
for
instance
we
might
wish
to
say
an
a
a
a
speaks
of
either
one
or
more
the
cow
the
cows
the
pig
the
pigs
the
plum
the
plums
you
like
a
score
the
pear
the
pears
the
fig
the
figs
an
oak
a
man
means
oak
or
man
of
all
mankind
a
dog
a
bone
means
dog
or
bone
a
dog
may
find
this
article
we
only
use
whenever
it
may
be
our
wish
to
speak
of
some
determined
thing
as
thus
bird
ox
fish
by
which
we
mean
not
bird
that
flying
in
the
air
may
be
or
ox
amongst
the
herd
or
fish
in
stream
or
sea
but
some
one
certain
bird
or
ox
or
fish
let
it
be
which
it
may
of
which
we
speaking
or
of
which
we
something
mean
to
write
or
say
remember
these
things
when
you
see
the
little
words
a
an
and
the
these
words
so
useful
though
so
small
are
those
which
articles
we
call
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
than
to
compel
young
children
to
commit
to
memory
mere
abstract
rules
expressed
in
difficult
and
technical
language
such
requires
a
painful
effort
of
the
mind
and
one
calculated
to
give
a
disgust
against
learning
was
formed
on
language
and
not
language
by
and
from
this
it
necessarily
follows
that
children
should
acquire
a
considerable
store
of
words
from
a
knowledge
of
reading
and
of
things
before
their
minds
are
taxed
by
abstract
rules
to
be
thoroughly
understood
they
require
words
to
be
compared
with
words
and
one
word
to
be
compared
with
another
and
how
can
this
be
done
without
the
memory
being
amply
supplied
with
them
previously
such
simple
instruction
as
this
chapter
directs
may
easily
be
given
but
to
attempt
much
more
would
be
like
endeavouring
to
build
an
elegant
and
ornamental
structure
before
you
had
collected
materials
to
build
with
chapter
xx
the
elliptical
plan
of
teaching
explained
its
he
tried
each
all
persons
acquainted
with
children
are
aware
of
the
torpor
of
some
minds
and
of
the
occasional
apathy
of
others
and
to
this
it
is
necessary
to
provide
some
counteraction
this
is
done
effectually
by
what
is
called
the
elliptical
plan
according
to
which
words
are
omitted
in
a
narrative
or
poem
repeated
by
the
teacher
for
the
purpose
of
being
supplied
by
the
children
these
exercises
are
very
agreeable
to
the
children
and
by
them
some
features
of
the
mental
character
become
conspicuous
children
are
usually
sensible
of
their
need
of
instruction
but
if
they
can
make
it
appear
that
any
of
their
statements
are
original
their
delight
is
especially
manifest
there
seems
too
a
dislike
at
first
to
take
any
trouble
to
arrive
at
the
truth
careless
children
will
therefore
guess
several
times
but
an
observant
teacher
will
at
once
perceive
that
there
is
no
effort
of
the
understanding
point
it
out
to
the
child
and
thus
prevent
its
recurrence
gilchrist
observes
in
a
letter
sent
to
me
you
have
now
the
whole
method
before
you
and
i
shall
boldly
stake
all
my
fame
as
a
practical
orientalist
on
the
salutary
consequences
that
will
spring
from
the
adoption
of
short
elliptical
tales
at
your
interesting
institution
my
usual
practice
with
respect
to
the
elliptical
method
of
teaching
is
to
deliver
some
appropriate
simple
extemporaneous
tale
leaving
out
but
few
words
at
first
and
those
such
as
must
obviously
strike
the
children
as
they
get
used
to
the
plan
i
make
the
omissions
more
frequent
and
of
words
less
obvious
the
following
specimens
will
render
the
whole
plain
to
the
understandings
of
my
readers

is
it
then
fitting
that
one
soul
should
pine
for
want
of
culture
in
this
favour
land
that
spirits
of
capacity
divine
perish
like
seeds
upon
the
desert
sand
that
needful
knowledge
in
this
age
of
light
should
not
by
birth
be
every
briton
right
although
it
has
been
the
special
design
of
the
present
work
to
speak
of
the
first
efforts
of
in
assisting
the
proper
development
of
the
mental
and
moral
faculties
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
indulging
in
a
few
remarks
on
the
methods
at
present
adopted
in
the
more
advanced
stages
of
education
as
seen
in
our
national
and
sunday
schools
i
need
i
am
sure
offer
no
other
apology
for
so
doing
than
the
fact
that
it
is
in
these
institutions
the
infant
poor
must
complete
their
education
it
is
in
these
schools
the
budding
faculties
must
either
ripen
or
perish
and
the
moral
principles
become
confirmed
or
weakened
certain
i
am
that
it
is
the
wish
of
all
concerned
in
these
praiseworthy
institutions
do
their
for
the
attainment
of
this
object
the
welfare
and
improvement
of
the
rising
generation
of
the
poor
classes
and
therefore
i
the
less
reluctantly
offer
a
few
thoughts
on
the
subject
which
it
is
my
humble
opinion
may
not
be
altogether
useless
with
regard
to
national
schools
i
must
say
there
is
too
much
form
and
too
little
of
the
spirit
of
instruction
to
be
found
in
their
management
the
minor
faculties
are
attended
to
in
preference
to
the
higher
ones
it
is
the
memory
alone
which
is
called
into
action
the
understanding
is
suffered
to
lie
in
a
state
of
torpid
inactivity
their
lessons
their
plan
of
using
them
and
their
discipline
altogether
are
of
that
monotonous
nature
that
the
children
always
seem
to
me
to
be
dosing
over
them
i
know
it
will
be
pleaded
that
the
number
to
be
taught
at
once
renders
this
defect
unavoidable
that
it
is
impossible
to
teach
a
large
body
of
children
in
such
a
way
as
to
secure
the
attention
and
activity
of
the
whole
and
it
is
so
far
true
as
to
its
being
impossible
to
detect
and
reform
every
idle
pupil
who
finds
an
opportunity
of
indulging
his
idleness
in
the
divided
attention
of
his
teacher
but
i
do
think
if
it
be
impossible
to
cure
the
evil
it
may
be
in
a
great
degree
prevented
make
your
system
interesting
lively
and
inspiriting
and
your
scholars
will
neither
be
able
nor
willing
to
slumber
over
it
every
one
knows
what
an
effect
is
produced
on
the
physical
faculties
by
a
succession
of
the
same
sound
for
instance
by
the
long
continued
chiming
of
a
single
bell
it
induces
a
drowsiness
which
we
find
it
impossible
to
resist
except
by
turning
our
attention
to
another
thing
but
let
a
number
of
bells
strike
out
into
a
merry
peal
how
quickly
we
are
aroused
how
lively
we
become
whilst
their
various
secure
the
attention
and
interest
which
their
pleasing
and
spirited
tones
first
excited
and
just
so
it
is
with
the
mind
in
the
matters
of
education
you
must
give
a
variety
of
tones
a
newness
of
aspect
to
your
lessons
or
you
will
never
be
able
to
keep
up
a
lively
attention
in
your
scholars
for
this
purpose
i
would
particularly
recommend
to
the
attention
of
all
concerned
the
chapters
in
this
volume
on
geometry
conversation
pictures
and
likewise
that
on
the
elliptical
method
by
adopting
the
plan
recommended
in
these
chapters
the
children
will
have
something
to
do
and
to
do
that
something
they
must
be
the
first
object
of
the
teacher
is
to
excite
a
thirst
for
knowledge
not
to
pour
unwelcome
information
into
the
mind
it
will
probably
be
said
that
however
well
adapted
the
plan
recommended
may
be
for
the
infantine
scholars
for
whom
it
was
designed
yet
it
does
not
follow
that
it
may
be
equally
advantageous
for
those
of
a
more
advanced
age
and
if
by
this
it
is
meant
that
the
very
same
lessons
are
not
equally
applicable
in
both
cases
i
perfectly
agree
with
the
truth
of
the
objection
but
it
is
the
of
education
that
i
recommend
and
would
affirm
to
be
as
applicable
to
children
of
the
most
advanced
age
as
to
those
of
the
youngest
and
i
may
further
add
that
unless
this
is
done
these
schools
will
not
be
in
a
proper
state
to
receive
our
children
so
as
to
carry
on
the
cultivation
of
all
the
faculties
instead
of
the
memory
only
it
is
not
sufficient
to
store
the
memory
we
must
give
employment
to
the
understanding
it
is
not
sufficient
to
talk
to
the
children
of
piety
and
of
goodness
we
must
present
them
with
a
living
example
of
both
and
secure
as
far
as
possible
an
imitation
of
such
example
as
applicable
to
sunday
schools
i
would
particularly
recommend
the
use
of
picture
lessons
on
scripture
subjects
for
the
use
of
the
junior
classes
to
be
used
as
a
sort
of
text
for
conversation
suited
to
the
state
of
their
mental
faculties
i
am
convinced
that
the
knowledge
acquired
by
this
method
is
likely
to
make
a
deeper
and
more
lasting
impression
than
that
imparted
in
a
less
interesting
mode
nor
should
the
lessons
on
natural
history
be
neglected
in
my
humble
opinion
in
the
system
of
sunday
school
instruction
inasmuch
as
the
more
the
children
know
of
the
wonders
of
creation
the
greater
must
be
their
reverence
of
the
almighty
creator
in
addition
to
which
it
will
enable
the
teachers
to
supply
variety
a
thing
so
agreeable
and
indeed
indispensable
in
the
instruction
of
children
for
these
reasons
i
think
it
could
not
justly
be
considered
as
either
a
misemployment
or
profanation
of
the
for
the
elder
children
moreover
it
would
be
advisable
to
have
occasional
class
lectures
simplified
for
the
purpose
on
astronomy
natural
history
and
although
it
might
be
unadvisable
to
occupy
the
hours
of
the
with
the
delivery
of
them
they
might
be
given
on
some
evening
and
should
be
made
the
medium
of
reward
to
good
behaviour
such
children
as
had
misbehaved
themselves
being
proscribed
from
attending
when
thus
seen
in
the
light
of
a
privilege
they
would
not
fail
to
be
interesting
to
the
little
auditors
as
well
as
conducive
to
good
behaviour
sunday
schools
should
not
be
too
large
nor
should
children
remain
in
them
too
long
i
have
observed
some
instances
when
this
has
been
neglected
of
choices
being
made
and
connections
formed
which
must
be
often
very
prejudicial
it
is
with
some
degree
of
reluctance
and
apprehension
i
touch
upon
another
topic
that
of
religious
doctrine
as
schools
for
gratuitous
instruction
have
been
established
by
most
of
the
religious
sects
extant
it
is
obvious
that
some
dissimilarity
of
sentiment
on
religions
subjects
must
exist
as
imparted
in
such
schools
let
it
not
be
supposed
that
i
would
cast
a
censure
on
any
religious
body
for
establishing
a
school
devoted
to
such
a
blessed
purpose
on
the
contrary
i
rejoice
to
see
that
however
various
their
theories
may
be
their
opinion
of
christian
practice
as
evinced
in
such
actions
is
the
same
but
one
thing
i
would
say
to
each
and
to
all
let
a
prominence
be
given
to
those
fundamental
truths
of
love
and
goodness
which
christianity
inculcates
let
the
first
sounds
of
religion
which
salute
the
ears
of
infancy
be
that
heavenly
proclamation
which
astonished
and
enraptured
the
ears
of
the
wakeful
shepherds
peace
on
earth
and
towards
men
it
was
the
by
which
salvation
was
ushered
into
the
world
and
surely
no
other
can
be
so
proper
for
introducing
it
into
the
minds
of
children
i
must
candidly
own
that
i
have
occasionally
witnessed
a
greater
desire
to
teach
particular
doctrines
than
the
simple
and
beautiful
truths
which
form
the
spirit
of
religion
and
it
is
against
this
practice
i
have
presumed
to
raise
a
dissentient
voice
the
conductors
of
schools
in
connexion
with
the
british
and
foreign
school
society
have
generally
spoken
more
highly
of
the
infant
system
than
others
and
this
is
certainly
to
be
attributed
to
more
congeniality
since
in
them
the
mental
powers
are
more
fully
exercised
and
there
is
a
greater
variety
in
the
instruction
given
the
only
objection
i
can
discover
to
them
is
one
that
lies
equally
against
the
national
schools
i
mean
the
opportunities
afforded
for
monitorial
oppression
but
this
may
be
obviated
in
both
cases
by
the
judgment
and
vigilance
of
the
teachers
it
should
be
added
that
schools
of
both
kinds
demand
occasional
inspection
from
those
intimately
acquainted
with
the
systems
avowedly
adopted
as
they
appear
very
different
in
different
places
i
will
only
mention
further
on
this
topic
that
many
schools
are
too
large
no
infant
school
i
conceive
should
exceed
nor
should
a
national
or
british
and
foreign
school
exceed
when
under
the
care
of
one
master
one
half
of
these
numbers
would
be
much
better
than
the
whole
and
tend
greatly
to
the
success
of
the
schools
but
funds
are
so
difficult
to
raise
from
the
apathy
shown
by
persons
in
general
to
the
instruction
of
the
poor
and
therefore
the
schools
are
so
few
in
number
that
it
is
absolutely
requisite
to
place
as
great
a
number
of
children
as
possible
under
one
master
that
expense
may
be
saved
when
will
this
sad
state
of
things
be
changed
and
the
country
at
large
see
that
the
noblest
object
it
can
ever
attempt
is
to
rear
up
its
whole
population
to
intelligence
virtue
and
piety
in
conclusion
i
would
observe
that
as
the
foregoing
remarks
have
been
kindly
made
in
such
a
manner
it
is
my
hope
they
will
all
be
received
it
is
most
gratifying
to
me
to
be
able
to
add
that
since
the
above
remarks
were
written
great
improvements
have
been
made
in
national
schools
a
large
portion
of
the
public
attention
has
been
lately
drawn
to
the
subject
and
it
is
almost
universally
admitted
that
the
present
system
is
capable
of
considerable
improvement
this
must
be
gratifying
to
those
persons
who
have
borne
the
heat
and
burthen
of
the
day
the
national
society
are
taking
measures
to
improve
their
systems
and
also
by
forming
diocesan
societies
to
establish
normal
schools
for
the
instruction
of
teachers
on
improved
principles
throughout
the
country
i
would
to
god
the
church
of
england
had
done
this
long
ago
she
would
have
had
fewer
enemies
and
could
now
have
put
on
a
bolder
front
i
trust
in
god
that
even
now
it
is
not
too
late
and
that
circumstances
may
transpire
to
render
her
efforts
in
this
sacred
cause
doubly
effective
she
has
lately
made
a
noble
stand
in
defence
of
principle
this
will
have
its
proper
effect
but
she
must
not
stop
there
for
the
enemy
is
in
the
field
and
though
he
is
quiet
for
a
time
the
dragon
is
not
crushed
the
utmost
vigilance
will
be
necessary
to
counteract
the
wiliness
of
the
serpent
real
improvements
in
education
must
be
adopted
the
books
used
in
her
schools
must
be
revised
and
improved
a
larger
amount
of
knowledge
must
be
given
to
the
poorer
portion
of
her
sons
and
then
a
beneficial
reaction
will
not
be
far
distant
she
has
done
much
but
she
has
much
more
to
do
if
she
does
not
the
ground
there
are
others
that
will
dependence
upon
the
divine
will
sound
discretion
and
christian
principle
must
be
her
guide
goodness
must
be
her
fortress
and
truth
her
finger
post
and
then
i
for
one
perceive
that
she
will
not
fail
for
the
bulk
of
her
people
are
still
favourable
to
her
and
will
rise
up
in
her
defence
when
their
assistance
is
required
and
if
i
mistake
not
the
signs
of
the
times
there
will
be
work
for
the
thinking
portion
of
the
laity
soon
cut
out
work
which
i
fear
the
clergy
can
not
or
will
not
do
but
which
nevertheless
must
be
done
god
grant
that
it
may
be
done
well
whoever
may
be
the
instruments

generally
desirous

in

which
may
contribute
to
the
improvement
and

of
the
poorer
classes
have
nevertheless
been
unwilling
to
assist
in
the
establishment
of

schools
fearful
that
the
superior
method
pursued
in

should
render
the
children
educated
therein
much
better
informed
than
the
children
of
the
richer
classes
who
might
thus
be
supplanted
in
numerous
lucrative
and
honourable
situations
in
from
this
circumstance
one
of
the
two
following
conclusions
must
be
drawn
either
that
the
system
of
education
pursued
in
the
higher
schools
is
very
faulty
and
imperfect
or
that
the
fears
of
those
persons
are
entire
groundless
if
the
first
be
true
then
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
consequences
feared
by
the
richer
classes
must
necessarily
take
place
if
either
from
prejudice
or
apathy
they
continue
the
same
faulty
and
imperfect
method
of
education
which
by
the
expression
of
these
fears
they
positively
declare
is
usually
pursued
in
the
higher
schools
but
the
remedy
is
easy
let
the
same
good
principles
of
tuition
be
introduced
into
nurseries
and
into
those
schools
to
which
the
children
of
the
rich
are
sent
and
the
latter
will
not
fail
to
maintain
their
patrimonial
ranks
in
society
they
need
then
have
no
fear
least
the
poorer
classes
should
become
too
intellectual
but
on
the
contrary
they
will
soon
find
that
their
own
welfare
security
and
happiness
will
not
only
be
insured
but
will
increase
in
proportion
as
the
poorer
classes
gain
knowledge
for
by
the
method
of
instruction
pursued
in
the
the
knowledge
there
acquired
is
necessarily
accompanied
by
the
practice
of
industry
sobriety
honesty
benevolence
and
mutual
kindness
in
fine
by
all
the
moral
and
religious
virtues
that
the
system
of
instruction
recommended
in
the
foregoing
pages
is
equally
applicable
to
the
children
of
the
rich
as
to
those
of
the
poor
there
can
be
no
doubt
and
it
might
be
adopted
either
in
schools
established
on
its
principles
or
in
the
nursery
it
is
indeed
obvious
that
it
might
be
carried
to
a
much
greater
extent
where
the
means
of
so
doing
would
not
be
wanting
many
things
might
be
taught
which
it
is
neither
advisable
nor
practicable
to
teach
in
the
schools
established
for
the
instruction
of
poor
children
whilst
the
elements
of
number
form
and
language
may
be
taught
by
the
means
and
after
the
manner
recommended
in
the
preceding
chapters
on
the
respective
subjects
there
are
other
branches
of
knowledge
which
might
enter
into
the
scope
of
nursery
instruction
with
great
advantage
to
the
children
as
an
introduction
to
i
would
make
the
children
acquainted
with
the
progress
of
vegetation
from
words
but
from
i
would
have
three
or
four
filled
with
mould
introduced
into
the
nursery
at
a
proper
season
of
the
year
the
children
should
be
asked
what
is
in
the
dirt
or
mould
will
of
course
be
the
reply
they
should
then
be
shewn
the
seeds
which
are
to
be
deposited
in
the
mould
and
assuming
in
the
eyes
of
the
children
a
prophetic
character
the
mother
or
governess
should
inform
them
of
the
process
of
vegetation
and
that
about
a
certain
time
a
pretty
flower
will
make
its
appearance
in
the
pots
the
seeds
should
then
be
deposited
in
the
mould
and
the
pots
placed
in
a
proper
situation
it
would
not
be
improper
to
let
the
children
themselves
sow
the
seed
thus
convincing
them
of
their
power
of
being
useful
and
becoming
the
instrument
of
so
great
a
wonder
as
the
transformation
of
a
seed
into
a
flower
during
the
time
the
seed
is
lying
unperceived
beneath
the
mould
the
children
should
frequently
be
sent
to
look
if
the
pretty
flower
has
come
up
or
questioned
as
to
what
they
were
told
concerning
it
at
length
the
green
shoot
will
make
its
appearance
just
peeping
above
the
mould
to
the
no
small
surprise
and
gratification
of
the
little
observers
they
will
mark
with
attentive
eagerness
the
progress
of
its
growth
the
appearance
of
the
bud
and
the
gradual
development
of
the
pretty
flower
till
they
are
fully
convinced
of
the
wisdom
of
the
parent
or
teacher
who
foretold
all
which
has
happened
and
made
acquainted
with
the
process
of
vegetation
not
from
words
but
from
observation
certain
it
is
that
such
a
lesson
could
not
be
wholly
useless
in
the
first
place
it
might
be
made
the
means
of
impressing
them
with
ideas
of
the
almighty
power
highly
conducive
to
piety
secondly
it
would
beget
a
habit
of
observation
thirdly
it
would
be
likely
to
produce
a
love
of
flowers
and
the
vegetable
world
favourable
to
their
future
pursuits
in
the
science
of
botany
and
lastly
it
would
inspire
their
little
breasts
with
a
love
and
respect
for
the
parents
or
teachers
who
were
wise
and
kind
enough
to
teach
them
so
many
true
and
wonderful
things
as
an
efficient
and
amusing
introduction
to
i
would
have
every
nursery
provided
with
a
microscope
by
means
of
which
the
minds
of
the
children
might
be
excited
to
wonder
and
admiration
at
the
amazing
beauty
and
perfection
of
the
insect
world
and
the
astonishing
construction
of
various
substances
as
seen
through
this
instrument
so
far
would
this
be
from
begetting
habits
of
cruelty
that
it
would
be
very
likely
to
check
them
many
children
who
would
be
loath
to
torture
a
large
animal
such
as
a
cat
a
dog
or
a
bird
feel
no
compunction
at
a
fly
because
it
appears
to
them
so
insignificant
an
animal
but
had
they
once
witnessed
by
means
of
a
microscope
the
wonderful
and
perfect
conformation
of
the
insect
i
am
persuaded
they
would
be
less
inclined
to
make
the
distinction
various
devices
might
be
made
use
of
to
teach
the
first
truths
of
so
simple
a
device
as
an
apple
with
a
wire
run
through
its
centre
turned
round
before
a
candle
might
serve
to
explain
the
phenomena
of
day
and
night
whilst
the
orrery
with
the
accompaniment
of
a
simple
and
familiar
lecture
it
should
be
much
more
so
indeed
than
any
i
have
heard
or
read
would
make
them
acquainted
with
those
stupendous
facts
which
strike
us
with
as
astonishment
and
awe
it
has
been
well
observed
by
young
with
respect
to
the
wonders
of
astronomy
in
little
things
we
search
out
god
in
great
he
seizes
us
one
thing
i
would
here
notice
that
it
should
be
a
constant
practice
to
remind
the
children
that
in
the
apple
and
the
orrery
they
see
only
a
resemblance
to
the
earth
and
the
heavenly
bodies
that
are
vast
in
size
and
distance
beyond
their
comprehension
at
the
same
time
leading
them
to
an
actual
observation
of
the
heavens
by
means
of
a
telescope
this
would
be
a
high
treat
to
the
children
and
productive
of
correct
notions
which
are
but
too
apt
to
be
lost
where
we
are
under
the
necessity
of
teaching
by
signs
so
infinitely
unlike
in
size
and
nature
as
the
candle
and
the
apple
and
the
brass
balls
and
wires
of
the
orrery
to
the
earth
and
the
heavenly
orbs
for
giving
the
children
their
first
lessons
in
i
would
have
a
in
every
nursery
painted
like
a
map
but
of
course
not
filled
up
so
perfectly
as
maps
for
adults
necessarily
are
it
should
contain
a
correct
delineation
of
the
position
of
a
certain
space
of
the
globe
we
will
say
for
instance
of
england
let
the
children
then
be
told
to
proceed
from
a
certain
spot
to
go
through
certain
counties
towns
and
to
fetch
a
piece
of
cloth
from
yorkshire
or
a
knife
from
sheffield
cheese
from
cheshire
butter
from
dorset
or
lace
from
huntingdonshire
the
lessons
thus
given
would
be
at
once
amusing
and
instructive
both
to
the
governess
and
children
if
preferred
these
maps
might
be
painted
of
a
less
size
to
cover
a
table
no
difficulty
would
be
found
to
get
a
set
of
such
or
painted
if
the
public
would
once
encourage
the
plan
there
are
now
large
skeleton
maps
published
which
have
merely
the
principal
cities
towns
and
rivers
marked
down
so
as
not
to
present
too
many
objects
to
confuse
the
young
eye
there
are
also
picture
maps
in
which
the
chief
productions
of
a
country
both
vegetable
and
animal
are
delineated
in
their
proper
places
these
would
form
a
great
aid
in
nursery
instruction
and
also
for
an
infant
school
let
the
great
truth
be
ever
borne
in
mind
that
what
is
seen
by
the
eye
is
more
quickly
understood
and
more
certainly
remembered
than
what
is
merely
described
or
made
known
in
words
i
would
also
have
an
oblong
tray
made
to
hold
water
large
enough
to
cover
a
table
in
this
i
would
fasten
pieces
of
cork
cut
out
in
the
shape
of
land
according
to
the
best
maps
while
other
small
bits
of
cork
should
represent
the
mountains
and
hills
on
the
surface
of
the
respective
islands
by
application
to
the
a
sufficient
number
of
animals
might
be
got
to
stock
the
respective
islands
with
their
appropriate
inhabitants
whilst
the
manufactures
and
many
of
the
natural
products
of
the
different
places
might
be
readily
supplied
by
the
ingenuity
of
the
parent
or
governess
a
little
boat
should
then
be
provided
and
a
voyage
to
a
given
part
undertaken
various
islands
might
be
touched
at
and
various
commodities
taken
on
board
or
exchanged
according
to
the
mercantile
instructions
the
children
should
receive
whilst
brief
accounts
might
at
first
be
read
or
given
of
the
climate
productions
and
inhabitants
of
the
respective
places
till
the
little
scholar
should
be
able
to
conduct
the
voyage
purchase
or
exchange
commodities
and
give
an
account
of
the
various
countries
and
their
inhabitants
by
himself
certain
i
am
that
more
might
be
acquired
by
this
toothed
of
geographical
knowledge
in
one
week
than
by
the
old
method
in
a
twelvemonth
and
what
the
children
did
learn
they
would
always
remember
i
might
extend
these
suggestions
to
the
size
of
a
small
volume
had
i
space
to
do
so
but
the
limits
of
the
present
one
forbid
at
a
future
period
should
my
active
employments
permit
i
may
resume
the
subject
of
in
an
extended
and
separate
form
there
are
indeed
many
excellent
works
already
published
on
the
subject
but
as
by
the
suggestions
and
contributions
of
many
every
plan
is
likely
to
be
perfected
no
one
is
justified
in
withholding
any
thing
likely
to
promote
the
desired
object
a
due
improvement
of
these
advantages
will
make
the
progress
of
the
higher
classes
more
than
commensurate
with
that
of
the
lower
it
is
obvious
that
the
former
have
resources
which
can
not
be
obtained
by
the
latter
they
have
the
means
too
of
availing
themselves
of
all
improvements
in
education
of
engaging
the
most
intelligent
and
efficient
instructors
and
of
frequently
changing
the
scene
for
their
children
and
consequently
the
objects
which
come
under
their
observation
which
i
ask
is
the
more
honourable
course
to
object
as
some
do
to
the
education
of
the
infant
poor
lest
they
should
learn
too
much
or
to
improve
then
the
opportunities
they
have
by
which
they
and
their
children
they
surpass
all
others
a
few
words
ought
to
be
added
on
discipline
at
home
it
is
not
uncommon
to
hear
parents
in
all
classes
of
society
say
that
child
is
too
much
for
me
i
can
not
manage
him
at
all
we
should
think
him
a
most
unpatriotic
englishman
who
should
say
the
french
are
too
strong
for
us
we
can
not
beat
them
but
very
far
more
absurd
and
truly
unparental
it
is
to
confess
that
a
mere
child
is
master
of
its
parents
a
grown
person
and
an
infant
what
a
contrast
true
it
is
that
many
a
child
has
become
very
unmanageable
but
this
may
always
be
traced
to
early
neglect
if
from
the
earliest
infancy
the
young
mind
is
trained
to
little
acts
of
obedience
they
will
soon
become
habitual
and
pleasant
to
perform
but
if
improper
indulgence
and
foolish
kindness
be
practised
towards
children
they
must
of
course
grow
up
peevish
fretful
and
obstinate
saucy
and
unmanageable
whatsoever
a
man
soweth
that
shall
he
reap
let
this
truth
be
ever
engraved
upon
the
minds
of
all
parents
a
constant
exercise
of
parental
love
in
allowing
all
that
is
fit
and
proper
and
a
firm
and
judicious
use
of
parental
authority
in
strictly
refusing
and
forbidding
all
that
is
unsuitable
or
wrong
should
harmoniously
unite
their
power
in
training
up
the
young
punishments
as
a
last
resource
ought
to
be
used
but
never
in
a
spirit
of
anger
wrath
or
revenge
if
administered
calmly
and
mildly
they
will
have
a
double
power
every
wilful
offence
of
a
child
seems
to
say
correct
me
but
with
judgment
it
may
be
painful
to
a
parent
to
put
on
the
graver
countenance
of
love
but
parental
will
always
do
it
oh
that
all
parents
in
every
rank
of
life
saw
and
acted
upon
the
great
truth
that
the
noblest
object
that
they
can
present
to
themselves
and
the
greatest
obligation
that
is
laid
upon
them
is
to
rear
up
their
children
to
intelligence
virtue
and
piety
to
make
them
good
rather
than
great
for
if
they
are
the
former
they
will
assuredly
be
the
latter
in
its
highest
and
truest
sense
a
footnote
a
should
the
reader
be
pleased
with
this
volume
i
may
refer
to
another
work
of
mine
just
published
entitled
a
system
for
the
education
of
the
young
having
now
finished
all
that
i
have
to
say
on
infant
schools
i
would
in
conclusion
breathe
forth
a
sincere
petition
to
the
throne
of
divine
truth
and
goodness
for
the
prosperity
and
spread
of
the
system
in
which
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
joined
by
all
who
have
been
convinced
of
its
beneficial
effects
in
promoting
the
present
and
everlasting
welfare
of
human
beings
mysterious
are
thy
ways
o
god
yet
who
was
ever
disappointed
that
asked
of
thee
in
a
right
spirit
prosper
then
thy
work
which
is
begun
in
the
world
we
beseech
thee
o
lord
may
thy
gracious
providence
so
encircle
and
protect
the
rising
generation
that
there
may
be
no
more
complaining
in
our
streets
protect
them
o
lord
from
the
many
dangers
that
surround
them
as
soon
as
they
draw
their
breath
in
this
vale
of
tears
and
put
into
the
hearts
of
those
who
have
the
means
to
consider
the
state
of
the
infant
poor
to
give
them
the
assistance
they
need
grant
that
thy
blessed
example
may
be
followed
by
many
for
thou
didst
desire
that
children
should
come
unto
thee
and
not
be
forbidden
and
thou
didst
take
them
up
in
thine
arms
and
bless
them
declaring
that
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
may
thy
creatures
therefore
not
be
ashamed
to
notice
little
children
but
hand
and
heart
with
each
other
and
endeavour
to
teach
them
all
good
may
difference
of
sentiment
and
opinion
be
laid
aside
and
forgotten
and
may
all
join
hand
and
heart
in
endeavouring
to
rescue
the
infant
race
from
danger
and
so
these
tender
plants
may
be
nurtured
with
the
dew
of
thy
divine
blessing
and
be
thus
made
fit
subjects
for
thy
heavenly
kingdom
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
may
thy
divine
influence
descend
abundantly
upon
all
those
who
have
hitherto
turned
their
attention
to
infant
children
may
they
feel
great
pleasure
in
doing
good
may
they
receive
thy
grace
and
protection
abundantly
and
when
their
days
of
probation
are
ended
may
they
find
a
place
in
thy
heavenly
mansions
and
there
glorify
thee
throughout
the
boundless
ages
of
eternity

a
this
prayer
written
more
than
thirty
years
ago
the
reader
will
see
a
great
portion
of
the
prayer
has
been
answered
the
subject
has
been
mooted
in
parliament
the
government
have
mooted
the
question
of
education
and
even
the
sovereign
has
recommended
attention
to
it
