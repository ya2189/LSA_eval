the
grand
mesa
of
colorado
is
a
westward
extension
of
the
mountains
of
central
colorado
standing
more
than
five
thousand
feet
above
the
valleys
of
the
colorado
and
the
gunnison
rivers
to
certain
montane
mammals
the
mesa
is
a
peninsula
of
cool
moist
forest
surrounded
by
inhospitable
hot

discussion
the

placed
according

also

it

less

these

almost
half

some

another
