introduction
the
interviews
for
this
book
were
conducted
from
may
to
december
they
appeared
as
cover
stories
for
the
a
free
weekly
paper
that
was
distributed
to
homes
and
businesses
in
new
york
city
founded
by
bruce
logan
in
the
as
the
side
tv
it
consisted
of
tv
listings
advertisements
and
two
stories
per
issue
one
was
a
friendly
restaurant
review
of
an
advertiser
the
other
was
a
profile
of
a
prominent
resident
of
the
upper
west
side
of
manhattan
the
honoree
face
appeared
on
the
cover
framed
by
a
tv
screen
the
formula
was
successful
enough
so
that
in
bruce
began
publishing
the
side
tv
as
well
my
job
was
to
track
down
the
biggest
names
i
could
find
for
both
papers
interview
them
and
write
a
story
most
interviewees
were
in
the
arts
and
entertainment
industry
actors
singers
dancers
writers
musicians
news
broadcasters
and
radio
personalities
bruce
quickly
recruited
me
to
write
the
restaurant
reviews
as
well
during
my
two
and
a
half
years
at
the
paper
i
wrote
about
interviews
these
are
my
favorites
of
the
ones
that
survive
these
stories
represent
my
first
professional
work
as
a
journalist
i
arrived
in
new
york
city
in
november
at
age
hungry
for
an
opportunity
to
write
after
spending
six
years
practicing
my
craft
at
college
and
community
newspapers
in
new
england
i
had
just
started
to
sell
a
few
stories
in
maine
but
realized
i
would
have
to
move
to
a
big
city
if
i
was
serious
about
switching
careers
from
social
worker
to
journalist
my
gigs
as
an
unpaid
writer
for
small
local
papers
included
a
music
column
for
the
boston
community
and
a
theater
column
for
the
in
portland
maine
i
had
learned
the
two
most
important
rules
of
journalism
get
your
facts
straight
and
meet
your
deadlines
i
had
taught
myself
pitman
shorthand
and
could
take
notes
at
words
a
minute
so
i
felt
ready
to
make
the
leap
if
someone
gave
me
a
chance
full
of
hope
i
quit
my
job
in
rural
maine
as
a
senior
citizens
aide
drove
to
new
york
sold
my
car
moved
into
an
upper
west
side
apartment
with
two
aspiring
opera
singers
and
began
to
look
for
work
one
aspect
of
the
new
york
personality
i
soon
observed
was
that
the
great
often
mingled
freely
with
the
ordinary
at
the
alpen
pantry
cafe
in
lincoln
center
where
i
worked
briefly
david
hartman
host
of
morning
came
in
for
his
coffee
every
morning
and
waited
in
line
like
everyone
else
john
lennon
was
said
to
walk
his
westside
neighborhood
alone
and
largely
undisturbed
the
other
side
of
the
new
york
mentality
was
shown
by
nightclubs
surrounded
by
velvet
ropes
where
uniformed
doormen
stood
guard
like
army
sentries
disdaining
the
riffraff
they
picked
out
certain
attractive
individuals
milling
outside
and
beckoned
them
to
cut
through
the
crowd
pay
their
admission
and
enter
the
appearance
of
status
counted
for
much
and
many
people
who
lived
on
street
one
block
from
central
park
got
their
mail
through
the
back
entrance
so
they
could
claim
the
higher
class
address
of
central
park
west
in
early
my
shorthand
skills
got
me
a
job
at
the
home
of
linda
grover
a
scriptwriter
for
the
tv
soap
opera
on
the
day
i
met
her
she
dictated
a
script
to
me
winging
it
while
glancing
at
an
outline
my
trial
of
fire
was
to
transcribe
it
type
it
up
that
night
and
turn
it
in
the
next
morning
for
revisions
i
got
little
sleep
but
completed
the
job
after
that
i
became
her
secretary
linda
soap
work
was
unsteady
and
to
supplement
her
income
she
wrote
all
the
cover
stories
for
after
i
been
helping
her
for
a
few
months
she
accepted
a
job
as
headwriter
for
a
new
soap
i
had
told
her
of
my
ambition
and
shown
her
some
of
my
writing
so
she
recommended
me
to
bruce
as
her
replacement
for
my
first
assignment
bruce
sent
me
to
interview
delores
hall
star
of
a
broadway
musical
with
an
cast
arms
too
short
to
box
with
i
went
to
the
theater
watched
the
show
then
met
delores
backstage
the
first
question
i
asked
her
was
is
that
your
real
hair
she
smiled
at
my
lack
of
diplomacy
and
did
answer
but
made
me
feel
completely
at
ease
she
led
me
outside
the
theater
and
without
embarrassment
asked
me
to
hail
the
taxi
for
us
then
she
directed
the
driver
to
a
favorite
soul
food
restaurant
where
she
stuffed
herself
while
i
conducted
the
interview
she
was
as
gracious
in
my
company
as
she
had
been
on
the
stage
while
bowing
to
a
standing
ovation
later
her
role
in
the
show
won
her
the
tony
award
for
best
featured
actress
in
a
musical
after
completing
my
delores
hall
story
i
was
kept
constantly
busy
at
the
for
as
long
as
i
stayed
in
new
york
at
first
bruce
gave
me
all
the
leads
many
of
whom
were
people
who
had
requested
to
be
on
the
cover
but
soon
i
was
after
bigger
game
and
began
to
systematically
hunt
down
people
whom
i
had
grown
up
admiring
i
scanned
magazine
each
week
to
find
out
which
celebrities
were
new
yorkers
when
i
landed
an
important
interview
i
often
visited
the
new
york
public
library
of
performing
arts
in
lincoln
center
to
study
the
clipping
files
and
prepare
my
questions
a
few
interviewees
were
distant
and
arrogant
making
it
clear
that
they
would
be
wasting
their
time
with
me
if
not
for
the
insistence
of
their
agent
a
cover
story
in
the
could
possibly
extend
a
broadway
run
for
a
few
days
or
sell
another
worth
of
tickets
to
the
ballet
or
opera
but
the
vast
majority
of
my
interview
subjects
were
friendly
respectful
and
even
a
little
flattered
by
the
thought
of
being
on
the
cover
in
general
the
biggest
people
were
most
likely
to
be
unpretentious
and
generous
of
spirit
it
was
thrilling
experience
to
meet
and
interview
the
people
who
had
been
my
idols
only
a
few
years
before
when
we
were
alone
together
in
a
room
i
felt
that
if
only
for
that
brief
period
i
were
the
equal
of
someone
who
had
achieved
greatness
i
had
grown
up
reading
superman
comics
and
one
day
it
flashed
on
me
this
is
metropolis
and
i
clark
kent
my
subjects
probably
found
me
somewhat
of
a
rube
i
did
dress
well
i
had
little
knowledge
of
new
york
i
asked
some
very
simplistic
questions
and
until
i
did
use
a
tape
recorder
so
perhaps
some
of
the
stars
were
put
off
their
guard
and
revealed
more
of
themselves
than
they
would
have
to
a
more
professional
interviewer
i
was
struck
by
how
they
were
for
success
probing
their
brains
was
like
getting
a
second
college
education
their
main
message
was
do
waste
your
life
and
do
do
anything
just
for
money
of
course
many
people
declined
my
request
for
an
interview
among
those
i
fished
for
but
failed
to
reel
in
were
richard
chamberlain
isaac
bashevis
singer
bob
keeshan
captain
kangaroo
rex
reed
halston
carrie
fisher
russell
baker
ted
sorensen
joseph
heller
margaret
meade
helen
gurley
brown
and
ira
gershwin
then
there
were
the
eastsiders
and
westsiders
too
famous
to
even
approach
such
as
woody
allen
bob
hope
and
mikhail
baryshnikov
the
person
who
did
more
than
anyone
else
to
secure
interviews
for
me
was
anna
sosenko
a
woman
in
her
late
who
owned
an
autograph
collectors
shop
on
west
street
filled
with
elegantly
framed
letters
manuscripts
and
autographed
photos
of
some
of
the
greatest
names
in
the
history
of
entertainment
despite
her
treasures
she
always
talked
with
one
hand
over
her
mouth
to
hide
the
fact
that
she
had
practically
no
teeth
for
years
anna
had
managed
the
career
of
cabaret
superstar
hildegarde
sell
and
had
penned
hildegarde
theme
song
darling
je
vous
aime
beaucoup
anna
was
still
a
formidable
figure
in
showbiz
every
year
she
produced
a
spectacular
show
in
a
broadway
theater
that
paid
tribute
to
broadway
legends
her
show
which
i
attended
included
live
performances
by
julie
andrews
agnes
demille
placido
domingo
alfred
drake
tovah
feldshuh
hermione
gingold
and
rex
harrison
i
met
anna
through
her
friendship
with
bruce
logan
and
she
became
my
direct
link
to
many
stars
of
the
older
generation
including
douglas
fairbanks
lillian
gish
ann
miller
maureen
and
sammy
cahn
one
phone
call
from
anna
was
enough
to
get
me
an
appointment
the
interviews
and
restaurant
reviews
a
total
of
four
stories
per
week
became
my
whole
life
and
i
had
little
time
for
friendships
hobbies
or
anything
else
by
late
i
realized
that
new
york
city
was
my
natural
element
it
was
too
too
overwhelming
too
impersonal
i
had
grown
dissatisfied
with
working
for
the
and
felt
that
i
had
squeezed
the
juice
from
the
orange
i
had
interviewed
everyone
i
wanted
to
meet
who
was
willing
to
sit
down
with
me
after
interviewing
my
fifth
or
sixth
broadcaster
or
dancer
things
began
to
feel
repetitive
i
pondered
what
tom
smothers
had
told
me
when
i
asked
why
the
smothers
brothers
had
split
up
as
an
act
first
you
just
do
it
then
you
do
it
for
fun
then
you
do
it
seriously
and
then
done
about
this
time
i
got
an
invitation
from
a
friend
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
to
move
out
west
and
give
it
a
try
i
told
bruce
i
was
quitting
when
i
gave
the
news
to
anna
she
said
you
might
never
come
back
she
was
right
in
my
last
couple
of
months
as
a
new
yorker
i
did
as
many
interviews
as
i
could
fit
it
i
left
for
maine
on
christmas
eve
of
taking
all
my
stories
with
me
and
flew
to
san
francisco
on
new
day
of
using
my
notes
i
wrote
up
my
final
interviews
during
my
early
months
on
the
west
coast
which
accounts
for
some
of
the
publication
dates
other
stories
dated
were
published
first
in
then
reused
i
have
no
record
of
their
original
dates
when
my
parents
moved
in
they
threw
away
my
entire
archive
fortunately
bruce
logan
had
saved
copies
of
most
of
the
stories
and
at
my
request
he
photocopied
them
and
sent
them
to
in
about
stories
were
missing
from
his
collection
and
therefore
can
not
be
included
here
among
the
lost
interviews
i
remember
are
soupy
sales
dave
marash
gael
greene
janis
ian
joe
franklin
and
barnard
hughes
after
i
began
thinking
a
lot
about
new
york
and
started
rereading
some
of
my
old
stories
my
eye
caught
this
statement
by
paul
goldberger
then
the
architecture
critic
for
the
york
this
is
probably
the
safest
environment
in
the
world
to
build
a
skyscraper
i
realized
that
the
new
york
of
today
is
quite
differently
from
that
of
the
late
and
thought
that
a
collection
of
my
interviews
might
be
of
interest
to
a
new
generation
of
readers
in
the
summer
of
i
finished
retyping
correcting
and
the
stories
three
of
my
interviews
isaac
asimov
alan
lomax
and
tom
wolfe
were
originally
published
in
two
different
versions
one
for
the
and
a
longer
one
for
the
a
weekly
community
newspaper
i
have
included
both
versions
here
also
my
interview
with
leonard
maltin
was
not
a
cover
story
but
a
westside
profile
it
appears
here
because
of
maltin
huge
future
success
as
a
writer
editor
and
tv
personality
in
the
course
of
my
research
i
uncovered
a
lot
of
information
about
what
happened
to
my
interviewees
after
many
have
died
some
have
grown
in
fame
and
some
have
virtually
disappeared
from
public
records
in
a
future
edition
of
this
book
i
hope
to
include
that
information
in
a
postscript
at
the
end
of
each
story
in
the
meantime
i
invite
readers
to
send
me
any
information
they
have
about
these
personalities

cleveland
amory
author
radio
humorist
and
president
of
the
fund
for
animals
it
impossible
to
mistake
the
voice
if
you
heard
it
once
the
tone
of
mock
annoyance
the
twangy
almost
whiny
drawl
that
rings
musically
in
the
ear
it
could
easily
belong
to
a
cartoon
character
or
a
top
tv
pitchman
but
it
does
it
belongs
to
cleveland
amory
an
affable
and
rugged
individualist
who
has
been
a
celebrated
writer
for
more
than
half
of
his
years
amory
is
also
a
highly
regarded
lecturer
and
radio
essayist
his
humor
spot
at
is
heard
daily
from
maine
to
california
his
latest
novel
nearing
completion
is
due
to
be
published
next
fall
perhaps
brought
amory
his
widest
fame
he
was
the
magazine
star
columnist
from
to
when
he
gave
it
up
in
order
to
devote
his
time
to
other
projects
especially
the
fund
for
animals
a
humane
organization
that
he
founded
in
he
has
served
as
the
group
president
since
the
beginning
now
it
has
members
across
the
united
states
amory
receives
no
pay
for
his
involvement
with
the
organization
the
national
headquarters
of
the
fund
for
animals
is
a
suite
of
rooms
in
an
apartment
building
near
carnegie
hall
the
central
room
is
lined
with
bookshelves
and
everywhere
on
the
walls
are
pictures
and
statues
of
animals
amory
enters
the
room
looking
utterly
exhausted
he
is
a
tall
man
with
a
shock
of
greyish
brown
hair
that
springs
from
his
head
like
sparks
from
an
electrode
as
we
sit
back
to
talk
and
his
two
pet
cats
walk
about
the
office
his
energy
seems
to
recharge
itself
amory
quest
to
protect
animals
from
needless
cruelty
began
several
decades
ago
when
as
a
young
reporter
in
arizona
he
wandered
across
the
border
into
mexico
and
witnessed
a
bullfight
shocked
that
people
could
applaud
the
death
agony
of
a
fellow
creature
of
this
earth
he
began
to
join
various
humane
societies
today
he
is
probably
the
best
known
animal
expert
in
america
his
kind
our
incredible
war
on
was
one
of
only
three
books
in
recent
years
to
be
the
subject
of
an
editorial
in
the
york
the
others
being
rachel
carson
and
ralph
nader
at
any
a
lot
of
people
ask
me
not
do
something
about
children
or
old
people
or
minorities
he
begins
lighting
a
cigarette
and
propping
one
foot
on
the
desk
my
feeling
is
that
there
enough
misery
out
there
for
anybody
to
work
at
whatever
he
wants
to
i
think
the
mark
of
a
civilized
person
is
how
you
treat
what
beneath
you
most
people
do
care
about
animals
but
you
have
to
translate
their
feelings
into
action
fighting
a
lot
of
things
the
clubbing
of
the
baby
seals
the
killing
of
dolphins
by
the
tuna
fishermen
the
poisoning
of
animals
the
leghold
trap
is
illegal
in
countries
of
the
world
but
only
in
five
states
in
the
the
reason
this
fight
is
so
hard
is
that
man
has
an
incredible
ability
to
rationalize
his
cruelty
when
they
kill
the
seals
they
say
it
a
humane
way
of
doing
it
but
i
do
see
anything
humane
about
clubbing
a
baby
seal
to
death
while
his
mother
is
watching
helpless
one
of
our
biggest
fights
right
now
is
to
make
the
wolf
our
national
mammal
there
only
about
of
them
left
in
the
continental
united
states
the
wolf
is
a
very
brave
animal
it
monogamous
and
it
has
great
sensitivity
one
of
his
chief
reasons
for
dropping
his
column
says
amory
was
because
after
years
of
trying
to
decide
whether
the
fonz
is
a
threat
to
shakespeare
i
wanted
to
write
about
things
that
are
more
important
than
that
his
latest
novel
a
satirical
work
that
he
considers
the
finest
piece
of
writing
he
has
ever
done
is
basically
a
satire
of
club
life
in
america
i
sent
it
down
to
a
typist
here
and
it
came
back
with
a
note
from
the
typist
saying
love
it
in
all
my
years
of
writing
i
do
think
i
ever
had
a
compliment
like
that
so
i
sent
the
note
to
my
editor
along
with
the
manuscript
an
expert
chess
player
he
was
long
ranked
number
one
at
harvard
club
until
his
recent
dethronement
at
the
hands
of
a
young
woman
i
play
russians
whenever
i
get
a
chance
he
confides
i
always
love
to
beat
russians
i
want
to
beat
them
all
once
he
played
against
viktor
korchnoi
the
defected
soviet
who
narrowly
lost
to
world
champion
anatoly
karpov
this
fall
i
think
he
threw
that
final
game
says
amory
of
korchnoi
loss
he
did
make
a
single
threatening
move
i
think
he
was
offered
a
deal
to
get
the
kid
and
wife
out
it
was
all
set
up
from
the
beginning
i
hate
facts
so
i
do
want
any
facts
to
interfere
with
my
thesis
born
outside
of
boston
he
showed
his
writing
talent
early
becoming
the
youngest
editor
ever
at
the
evening
his
first
book
proper
was
published
in
then
i
moved
to
new
york
he
muses
because
whenever
i
write
about
a
place
i
have
to
leave
it
nineteen
years
ago
he
took
on
as
his
assistant
a
remarkable
woman
named
marian
probst
who
has
worked
with
him
ever
since
says
amory
she
knows
more
about
every
project
i
been
involved
with
than
i
know
myself
a
longtime
westsider
he
enjoys
dining
at
the
russian
tea
room
there
are
so
many
facets
to
cleveland
amory
career
and
character
that
he
defies
classification
in
large
doses
he
can
be
extremely
persuasive
in
smaller
doses
he
comes
across
as
a
sort
of
boon
companion
for
everyman
who
provides
an
escape
from
the
woes
of
modern
society
through
his
devastating
humor
for
example
his
remark
about
president
carter
here
we
have
a
fellow
who
does
know
any
more
than
you
or
i
about
how
to
run
the
country
i
surprised
he
did
so
well

the

business

an
andrews
sister
finds
stardom
as
a
solo
maxene
andrews
riding
high
on
the
wave
of
her
triumphant
solo
act
that
opened
at
the
reno
sweeney
cabaret
last
november
is
sitting
in
her
dimly
lit
eastside
living
room
talking
about
the
foibles
of
show
business
as
one
of
the
andrews
sisters
america
most
popular
vocal
trio
of
the
she
made
gold
records
in
the
space
of
years
but
as
a
solo
performer
she
more
or
less
failed
in
two
previous
attempts
first
in
the
early
when
her
younger
sister
patty
temporarily
left
the
group
and
again
in
after
her
hit
broadway
show
closed
amid
controversy
not
until
did
miss
andrews
bring
together
all
the
elements
of
success
good
choice
of
songs
interesting
patter
between
numbers
and
a
accompanist
the
result
is
an
act
that
is
nostalgic
moving
and
musically
powerful
for
years
our
career
was
so
different
than
so
many
because
our
fans
never
forgot
us
she
recalls
beaming
with
matronly
delight
i
could
walk
in
anyplace
in
the
years
i
was
working
and
they
say
andrews
the
andrews
sisters
everybody
was
sort
of
in
awe
so
i
was
always
treated
like
a
star
of
some
kind
but
it
nice
to
work
it
a
wonderful
feeling
to
be
in
demand
she
is
a
bubbly
husky
character
of
with
ruddy
cheeks
and
a
firm
handshake
deeply
religious
sincere
and
outspoken
as
always
she
remains
first
and
foremost
an
entertainer
i
stick
to
the
older
standard
songs
by
great
composers
says
maxene
of
her
act
you
know
rodgers
and
hart
irving
berlin
my
partner
is
phil
campanella
an
extremely
talented
young
man
who
plays
the
piano
and
sings
harmony
all
the
talking
i
do
between
the
songs
is
ad
libbing
i
have
never
been
successful
at
trying
to
do
material
that
was
written
for
me
she
returning
to
reno

on
february
for
a
engagement

filming

taking
her

work
she
says
in
her
high
bell
clear
voice
is
not
my
future
i
would
like
to
get
into
concerts
and
i
think
that
a
possibility
probably
a
year
from
now
laverne
the
eldest
of
the
sisters
died
in
patty
stopped
speaking
to
maxene
five
years
ago
because
of
salary
disagreements
for
the
contracts
were
negotiated
separately
and
when
maxene
balked
at
accepting
a
week
less
than
her
sister
the
national
tour
was
abruptly
canceled
i
never
in
my
wildest
dreams
thought
that
we
would
separate
because
we
always
been
very
close
says
maxene
sadly
when
people
say
feuding
with
your
sister
i
say
that
not
the
truth
because
it
takes
two
people
to
fight
and
i
not
fighting
anyone
she
just
not
talking
to
me
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
be
able
to
handle
the
separation
i
used
to
wake
up
every
morning
and
say
have
i
done
but
now
i
just
throw
it
up
to
jesus
and
i
leave
it
there
i
hope
and
pray
that
one
of
these
days
we
can
bring
everything
out
in
the
open
and
clear
it
up
i
love
patty
very
much
and
i
very
surprised
that
she
not
out
doing
her
act
because
she
very
very
talented
she
been
doing
the
which
i
it
none
of
my
business
but
i
would
highly
disapprove
of
i
think
such
a
terrible
show
maxene
owns
a
house
outside
of
los
angeles
and
was
born
again
a
couple
of
years
ago
at
the
church
on
the
way
in
van
nuys
california
when
she
on
manhattan
east
side
which
is
often
she
shares
the
apartment
of
louis
parrish
an
and
psychiatrist
whom
she
describes
as
a
true
southern
gentleman
the

recorded

arrived
in
new
york
from
minneapolis
in
and
took
the
city
by
storm
with
their
wholesome
harmonies
and
innovative
arrangements
soon
they
were
making
movies
as
well
which
featured
abbott
and
costello
and
the
song
boogie

bugle

was
biggest
moneymaker
until
came
along
in
i
particularly
care
for
making
movies
comments
maxene
i
found
it
very
boring
and
very
repetitious
and
certainly
not
very
creative
but
working
with
bud
and
lou
was
a
lot
of
fun
now
divorced
maxene
has
a
daughter
named
aleda
and
a
son
peter
who
live
in
utah
she
has
written
her
autobiography
but
it
has
been
sold
to
a
publisher
because
i
refuse
to
write
the
kind
of
books
that
they
want
written
today
ever
since
the
christina
crawford
book
came
out
that
all
the
publishers
want
i
think
the
trend
will
pass
because
we
really
getting
saturated
in
cruelty
and
lust
and
whatever
else
you
want
to
call
it
asked
about
the
changes
in
her
life
since
her
religious
reawakening
maxene
says
darling
everything
has
improved
my
disposition
has
improved
i
used
to
be
impossible
for
anybody
to
work
with
i
now
reconciled
to
the
feeling
that
i
am
never
alone
and
that
in
him
i
have
a
partner
and
that
if
i
run
into
a
problem
that
i
ca
solve
then
i
not
supposed
to
solve
it
because
we
just
mere
mortals
westsider
lucie
arnaz
to
star
in
neil
simon
new
musical
bad
timing
that
what
had
plagued
me
ever
since
i
had
tried
to
get
an
interview
with
lucie
arnaz
last
june
back
then
i
was
supposed
to
get
together
with
her
downtown
but
our
meeting
was
canceled
at
the
last
minute
my
second
appointment
set
for
august
in
her
dressing
room
just
before
a
performance
of
get
your
at
the
jones
beach
theatre
in
wantagh
long
island
now
seemed
in
jeopardy
as
well
i
was
kept
waiting
nervously
outside
while
the
house
manager
insisted
that
lucie
was
engaged
in
a
very
important
telephone
call
but
when
the
young
star
finally
emerged
her
face
beaming
with
delight
i
found
that
my
timing
could
not
have
been
better
lucie
had
just
received
official
word
that
a
major
new
broadway
role
was
hers
as
we
sat
down
to
talk
lucie
was
in
one
of
those
radiant
moods
that
come
only
in
times
of
triumph
she
had
been
chosen
for
the
female
lead
in
a
new
musical
playing
my
which
is
scheduled
to
open
in
los
angeles
in
december
and
on
broadway
in
february
the
show
has
music
by
marvin
hamlisch
and
lyrics
by
carole
bayer
sager
the
book
is
written
by
neil
simon
i
a
lousy
auditioner
at
least
i
thought
i
was
grinned
lucie
this
new
musical
will
be
probably
the
pinnacle
of
what
i
been
aiming
for
it
about
a
fairly
successful
lyricist
who
not
nearly
as
successful
as
the
composer
she
going
to
work
with
neil
simon
has
always
wanted
to
do
a
play
about
songwriters
it
a
very
hip
pop
musical
it
does
have
regular
tunes
she
flopped
back
on
the
sofa
touching
my
arm
from
time
to
time
for
emphasis
and
chatted
on
in
her
mildly
raspy
voice
finally
she
moved
to
a
seat
in
front
of
the
mirror
and
invited
me
to
keep
talking
while
she
put
on
her
makeup
there
is
a
quality
about
her
that
suggests
toughness
but
this
impression
melts
away
under
her
girlish
charm
at
lucie
is
already
an
veteran
of
professional
acting
and
singing
when
she
performed
at
jones
beach
this
summer
up
to
people
per
night
came
to
see
her
lucie
first
transplanted
herself
from
the
west
coast
to
the
west
side
on
a
basis
last
winter
although
she
admitted
i
had
a
new
york
apartment
for
four
years
which
i
would
visit
every
couple
of
months
for
some
sick
reason
i
really
like
new
york
there
a
lot
of
crazy
people
doing
strange
things
on
the
streets
but
there
also
a
lot
of
creative
forces
here
i
went
to
do
an
interview
this
morning
for
my
radio
show
and
it
started
raining
by
the
time
i
had
walked
six
blocks
i
was
looking
terrible
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
never
present
myself
like
that
in
california
in
new
york
who
gives
a
damn
if
you
got
water
on
you
when
you
come
to
work
on
the
west
coast
the
things
that
important
they
seem
to
put
on
pedestals
her
radio
show
which
she
started
this
year
is
a
nationally
syndicated
interview
spot
called
in
with
from
to
she
was
a
regular
on
her
mother
tv
show
she
has
made
countless
guest
appearances
on
other
shows
and
performed
lead
roles
in
numerous
musicals
her
parents
lucille
ball
and
desi
arnaz
were
divorced
more
than
a
decade
ago
and
have
both
remarried
my
mother
was
here
for
opening
night
then
she
stayed
a
couple
of
days
in
new
york
but
she
gets
too
lonely
when
my
brother
desi
and
i
go
away
for
too

the
old
salsa

asked
to
make
an
album
of
those
tapes
speaking
of
her
hobbies
lucie
noted
that
recently
i
started
to
build
a
darkroom
in
my
house
the
key
word
is
started

hard
to
get
the
time
and
i
have
been
writing
songs
for
the
last
couple
of
years
i
a
lyricist
i
sung
them
on
things
like
and
she
enjoys
all
of
new
york
though
at
one
time
the
east
side
gave
me
the
ooga
boogas
then
i
found
a
couple
of
places
there
that
were
nice
on
the
west
side
she
likes
to
dine
at
la
cantina
victor
cafe
and
ying
all
on
columbus
avenue
near
and
streets
when
the
warning
sounded
in
her
dressing
room
lucie
had
to
turn
me
out
but
not
before
she
divulged
her
philosophy
about
show
business
am
i
ambitious
she
echoed
i
do
know
there
are
people
who
are
willing
to
really
knock
the
doors
down
and
do
just
about
anything
to
get
there
i
not
like
that
even
now
when
i
go
to
the
market
people
come
up
to
me
and
say
you
so
i
can
imagine
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
a
superstar
no
i
not
really
looking
forward
to
that
eastsider
adrien
arpel
america
beauty
author
as
a
young
girl
in
englewood
new
jersey
adrien
arpel
was
determined
that
one
day
she
would
transform
herself
into
a
beautiful
woman
after
having
her
nose
bobbed
she
began
to
pester
the
ladies
behind
every
cosmetic
counter
she
could
reach
and
by
the
time
she
graduated
from
high
school
at
she
knew
more
than
they
did
that
same
year
she
opened
a
small
cosmetics
shop
in
her
hometown
with
earned
from
today
at
she
is
the
president
of
a
company
selling
more
than
beauty
products
throughout
the
and
europe
not
content
with
mere
business
success
she
recently
turned
her
talent
to
writing
her
first
book
adrien
arpel
crash
beauty
program
it
was
on
the
york
list
for
six
months
and
is
still
selling
briskly
in
paperback
miss
arpel
received
from
pocket
books
for
the
reprint
rights
the
most
ever
for
a
beauty
book
i
have
always
been
a
rebel
she
proclaims
regally
dressed
in
a
stylish
edwardian
outfit
with
padded
shoulders
at
her
midtown
office
quite
heavily
made
up
with
hot
pink
lipstick
and
a
cleopatra
hairdo
she
looks
considerably
younger
than
her
age
the
strident
quality
of
her
voice
is
reminiscent
of
a
broadway
chorus
girl
yet
is
delivered
in
a
crisp
businesslike
manner
during
the
interview
she
rarely
smiles
or
strays
from
the
question
being
asked
for
some
reason
she
declines
to
say
much
about
her
new
book
to
look
years
which
is
scheduled
for
publication
in
april
instead
she
stresses
the
simple
rules
about
beauty
that
have
guided
her
career
from
the
beginning
probably
her
two
most
important
innovations
are
her
exclusive
use
of
products
chosen
from
leading
european
health
spas
and
her
policy
of
makeup
complimentary
makeup
is
offered
every
time
a
customer
gets
a
facial
at
one
of
the
hundreds
of
adrien
arpel
salons
such
as
those
on
the
first
floor
of
bloomingdale
and
saks
fifth
avenue
whenever
she
opens
a
new
salon
adrien
spends
the
entire
day
on
her
feet
doing
upwards
of
facials
with
her
own
pale
delicate
hands
upon
being
complimented
for
her
attire
miss
arpel
gasps
thank
you
with
schoolgirlish
delight
there
is
something
almost
surreal
in
her
creamy
white
complexion
i
think
sunbathing
is
absolutely
deadly
and
that
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
for
a
woman
to
sunbathe
she
says
moments
later
she
admits
that
high
heel
shoes
are
not
very
good
for
you
but
that
she
wears
them
anyway
because
they
very
fashionable
they
are
something
that
really
can
be
a
problem
if
they
pitched
wrong
if
you
have
a
good
shoe
and
it
pitched
well
you
should
have
a
problem
does
she
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
women
to
give
up
high
heels
altogether
no
no
i
do
think
you
ever
get
women
to
give
up
fashion
so
we
can
tell
what
problems
what
really
hazardous
going
to
be
injurious
to
your
health
and
what
going
to
just
hurt
a
little
bit
she
never
thought
of
writing
a
book
until
about
four
years
ago
says
arpel
because
every
second
when
i
was
away
from
my
business
i
spent
with
my
daughter
now
my
daughter
and
a
half
and
has
a
boyfriend
and
goes
out
and
does
want
to
spend
every
minute
with
me
this
all
started
when
she
was
about
adrien
and
her
husband
manufacturer
ronald
newman
moved
to
the
new
york
metropolitan
area
right
after
they
were
married
in
and
acquired
an
upper
east
side
apartment
last
summer
for
her
own
health
and
beauty
regimen
adrien
begins
her
typical
day
with
jumping
rope
she
thinks
weight
training
for
women
is
terrific
but
considers
jogging
the
best
exercise
now
jogging
has
its
negatives
i
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
if
you
jog
while
it
still
dark
out
it
can
be
dangerous
i
also
have
long
hair
and
you
have
to
wash
your
hair
after
you
jog
so
for
someone
that
works
i
find
that
i
can
only
do
it
three
days
a
week
she
has
a
facial
twice
weekly
facials
are
not
luxuries
they
are
necessities
to
peel
off
dead
surface
skin
air
pollution
is
the
reason
if
it
wears
away
stone
on
buildings
think
what
it
can
do
to
the
skin
a
facial
she
explains
consists
of
all
different
sorts
of
hand
massages
to
the
skin
with
milk
or
some
sort
of
sea
kelp
cleanser
then
there
a
skin
vacuum
which
takes
blackheads
out
electric
brushes
with
honey
and
almond
scrubs
which
clean
out
the
pores
and
at
the
end
a
mask
again
orange
jelly
sea
mud
or
spearmint
arpel
believes
that
a
woman
makeup
should
be
largely
determined
by
her
profession
she
reveals
a
humorous
side
when
asked
whether
a
woman
stockbroker
for
example
should
always
dress
conservatively
well
if
she
was
wearing
a
blouse
and
no
bra
in
her
office
certainly
think
she
had
poor
taste
she
laughs
a
nonsmoker
who
consumes
little
alcohol
she
confesses
to
at
least
one
vice
i
drink
two
cups
of
coffee
in
the
morning
sometimes
more
also
not
wonderfully
good
for
you
but
i
never
said
i
was
a
hundred
percent
good
westsider
isaac
asimov
author
of
books
in
when
the
science
fiction
writers
of
america
held
a
national
convention
to
vote
on
the
best
science
fiction
ever
published
in
this
country
they
sifted
through
hundreds
of
nominations
dating
back
to
the
before
coming
up
with
the
winners
received
the
most
votes
for
a
short
story
and
the
trilogy
won
for
the
best
series
of
novels
the
author
of
both
works
westsider
isaac
asimov
had
asimov
died
years
ago
his
fame
would
still
be
secure
but
he
remains
more
active
than
ever
he
is
among
other
things
one
of
the
most
prolific
authors
in
the
world
publishing
an
average
of
one
book
and
three
or
four
magazine
articles
per
month
he
is
sitting
at
an
electric
typewriter
in
his
west
street
penthouse
when
the
doorman
informs
him
that
two
visitors
have
arrived
asimov
is
expecting
a
single
reporter
but
he
says
ok
so
my
roommate
john
cimino
and
i
get
on
the
elevator
we
stop
at
the
floor
asimov
clad
in
his
undershirt
meets
us
at
the
door
hangs
up
our
coats
and
takes
us
into
the
living
room
adjacent
to
his
working
area
along
one
wall
is
a
bookcase
containing
the
books
asimov
has
written
in
his
literary
career
this
is
my
section
of
the
apartment
he
says
the
blinds
are
down
because
i
always
work
by
artificial
light
i
tell
him
that
john
has
come
along
to
ask
questions
about
science
asimov
is
an
expert
in
more
than
scientific
disciplines
while
i
will
be
asking
about
science
fiction
asimov
complies
and
after
about
minutes
he
opens
us
completely
and
gives
each
answer
with
enthusiasm
he
has
lost
a
little
weight
recently
and
in
fact
had
a
mild
heart
attack
earlier
this
year
but
asimov
is
as
creative
as
ever
perhaps
more
so
one
of
his
latest
projects
is
asimov
science
fiction
it
first
appeared
on
the
newsstands
early
in
and
has
since
built
up
a
broad
readership
throughout
the
canada
and
great
britain
it
was
the
idea
of
joel
davis
of
davis
publications
says
asimov
he
publishes
queen
mystery
mystery
and
many
others
he
decided
that
science
fiction
was
doing
well
and
that
he
wanted
a
science
fiction
magazine
something
with
the
name
of
someone
like
ellery
queen
he
asked
me
if
i
was
interested
i
was
really
because
i
had
neither
the
time
nor
the
inclination
to
edit
the
magazine
asimov
found
the
time
he
and
davis
worked
out
a
formula
for
the
author
to
lend
his
name
and
picture
to
the
magazine
cover
and
to
become
the
editorial
director
asimov
writes
the
editorials
and
some
of
the
fiction
answers
readers
letters
and
helps
with
the
story
selection
george
scithers
the
editor
has
a
major
role
in
deciding
the
magazine
contents
asimov
science
fiction
began
as
a
quarterly
and
if
all
goes
well
will
soon
become
a
monthly
some
of
its
contributors
are
writers
in
their
who
are
publishing
their
first
stories
containing
many
illustrations
and
almost
no
advertising
the
magazine
is
available
at
numerous
westside
newsstands
for
born
in
russia
and
raised
in
brooklyn
asimov
graduated
from
college
and
published
his
first
short
story
while
in
his
teens
for
many
years
he
taught
biochemistry
at
boston
university
in
he
returned
to
new
york
and
settled
on
the
west
side
he
is
married
to
a
psychiatrist
and
psychoanalyst
who
practices
under
her
maiden
name
of
janet
jeppson
her
office
is
on
the
opposite
end
of
the
apartment
she
too
is
a
writer
having
published
a
science
fiction
novel
and
some
stories
the
west
side
as
far
as
i
concerned
has
more
good
restaurants
than
any
other
place
on
earth
though
i
have
not
been
to
paris
says
asimov
who
hates
flying
he
made
a
trip
to
europe
last
year
on
the
queen
elizabeth
ii
and
came
back
on
the
return
voyage
it
was
a
vacation
he
says
i
gave
two
talks
each
way
and
i
wrote
a
book
the
irs
he
says
can
not
believe
that
he
does
take
vacations
in
the
last
seven
years
he
testifies
there
has
been
only
one
time
two
days
in
june
of
that
i
went
on
a
trip
and
did
do
a
talk
and
even
then
i
took
some
paper
with
me
and
worked
on
a
murder
mystery
you
see
a
vacation
is
doing
what
you
want
to
do
and
to
stop
doing
what
you
have
to
do
but
i
like
what
i
so
i
on
vacation
days
a
year
asimov
biggest
writing
project
these
days
is
his
massive
autobiography
which
he
expects
to
finish
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
will
probably
be
in
two
volumes
says
asimov
grinning
which
is
unreasonable
considering
that
i
have
led
a
very
quiet
life
and
not
much
has
happened
to
me
isaac
asimov
literary
workaholic
from
morning
has
come
to
the
west
side
in
a
penthouse
high
above
street
a
man
enters
his
study
pulled
down
the
shades
and
fills
the
room
with
artificial
light
reference
books
at
his
elbow
he
sits
down
at
his
electric
typewriter
and
begins
to
tap
out
sentences
at
the
rate
of
words
per
minute
fourteen
hours
later
his
day
work
complete
isaac
asimov
turns
off
the
machine
in
such
a
way
has
asimov
spent
most
of
the
past
seven
years
ever
since
he
moved
to
the
west
side
from
boston
in
a
literary
career
stretching
back
to
his
teens
he
has
written
and
published
books
including
science
fiction
science
fact
history
mystery
and
even
guides
to
shakespeare
and
the
bible
asimov
has
also
written
more
than
magazine
and
newspaper
articles
book
introductions
and
speeches
though
his
pen
has
never
been
silent
since
he
sold
his
first
piece
of
fiction
to
amazing
stories
in
asimov
is
now
enjoying
the
most
productive
period
of
his
career
since
he
has
written
books
an
average
of
one
per
month
he
does
not
dictate
his
books
nor
does
he
have
a
secretary
asimov
personally
answers
some
fan
letters
per
week
and
he
gives
speeches
frequently
he
also
finds
time
for
the
press
the
following
interview
took
place
on
a
morning
late
in
october
in
the
sitting
room
adjoining
his
study
along
one
wall
was
a
bookcase
approximately
by
feet
containing
asimov
collected
works
question
asimov
have
you
set
any
goals
for
yourself
for
the
next
years
or
so
asimov
i
afraid
i
do
generally
look
ahead
right
now
my
autobiography
is
the
big
project
i
have
no
ambition
whatsoever
outside
of
my
writing
i
expect
to
write
as
long
as
i
stay
alive
q
could
you
say
something
about
your
autobiography
a
it
longer
than
i
thought
it
would
be
as
soon
as
i
get
you
out
going
to
deliver
pages
to
to
doubleday
i
hoping
to
get
it
finished
by
the
end
of
the
year
it
will
probably
be
in
two
volumes
which
is
unreasonable
considering
that
i
led
a
very
quiet
life
and
not
much
has
happened
to
me
i
guess
the
only
thing
is
that
i
tend
to
go
on
and
on
when
i
on
my
favorite
subject
q
what
made
you
choose
the
west
side
to
live
a
i
ca
honestly
say
i
chose
the
west
side
when
i
came
to
new
york
in
i
lived
where
i
could
which
happened
to
be
the
west
side
but
now
that
i
here
i
like
it
i
was
brought
up
in
new
york
and
went
to
columbia
i
always
identified
myself
with
manhattan
my
publishers
almost
all
of
them
are
in
manhattan
taxis
are
available
at
any
time
i
west
side
as
far
as
i
concerned
has
more
good
restaurants
within
walked
distance
than
any
other
place
on
earth
though
i
have
not
been
to
paris
i
have
learned
to
tolerate
the
traffic
and
the
pollution
and
the
litter
when
i
go
to
the
east
side
it
looks
dull
by
comparison
q
i
see
that
your
science
fiction
story
nightfall
has
been
made
into
a
record
albert
and
i
also
remember
the
movie
version
of
your
do
you
have
plans
for
making
movies
or
recordings
out
of
your
other
science
fiction
works
for
example
the
series
a
fantastic
voyage
was
the
other
way
around
my
book
was
made
from
the
picture
the
foundation
series
has
been
turned
into
a
radio
show
in
great
britain
there
have
been
other
stories
of
mine
which
were
turned
into
radio
shows
in
the
i
have
expensive
pictures
under
option
whether
anything
will
turn
up
in
the
future
i
do
know
and
to
be
perfectly
honest
i
do
care
i
am
perfectly
happy
with
my
writing
career
as
it
is
i
have
complete
control
over
my
books
when
something
is
put
into
the
movies
it
can
be
changed
often
for
the
worse
i
might
get
nothing
out
of
it
both
money
and
i
have
enough
money
to
get
by
q
how
to
did
the
new
isaac
asimov
science
fiction
magazine
get
started
a
it
was
the
idea
of
joel
davis
of
davis
publications
he
publishes
ellery
queen
mystery
magazine
alfred
hitchcock
mystery
magazine
and
many
others
he
decided
that
science
fiction
was
doing
well
and
he
wanted
a
science
fiction
magazine
something
with
the
name
of
someone
he
had
seen
me
because
i
had
brought
in
some
stories
for
ellery
queen
he
asked
me
if
i
was
interested
i
was
really
because
i
had
neither
the
time
nor
the
inclination
to
edit
the
magazine
so
he
hired
george
scithers
to
be
the
editor
and
made
me
the
editorial
director
it
been
a
quarterly
to
begin
with
the
fifth
issue
which
will
go
on
sale
in
december
will
be
the
first
of
the
bimonthly
issues
after
the
second
year
it
will
be
a
monthly
if
all
things
go
well
q
could
you
tell
me
something
about
your
family
life
a
my
wife
is
a
psychiatrist
and
psychoanalyst
and
she
has
her
office
in
the
other
end
of
this
apartment
she
the
director
of
training
at
the
william
alanson
white
institute
on
west
street
the
name
she
practices
under
is
janet
jeppson
that
her
maiden
name
asimov
but
jeppson
she
also
a
writer
she
published
a
science
fiction
novel
and
a
few
short
stories
and
has
a
mystery
novel
trying
to
sell
q
do
you
stimulate
her
writing
by
your
own
work
a
if
anything
i
inhibit
it
she
was
a
writer
for
years
before
she
met
me
if
she
were
married
to
me
she
would
probably
write
more
in
fact
i
encourage
her
but
it
hard
when
your
husband
writes
as
fast
as
he
can
type
and
publishes
everything
he
writes
q
do
you
have
any
children
a
yes
i
have
two
children
by
my
first
marriage
a
boy
and
a
girl
he
working
at
a
gas
station
and
the
girl
is
a
senior
at
boston
college
when
she
left
home
at
i
said
the
only
thing
i
ask
of
her
was
not
to
smoke
so
she
done
that
what
else
she
does
i
do
know
but
she
does
smoke
q
i
realize
that
you
are
considered
an
authority
in
at
least
branches
of
science
have
you
ever
done
in
original
scientific
research
q
i
am
still
assistant
professor
of
biochemistry
at
boston
university
though
i
no
longer
teach
yes
i
did
original
research
from
to
i
could
not
with
honesty
say
i
accomplished
anything
of
importance
i
am
not
a
researcher
perhaps
not
even
a
researcher
it
surprised
me
too
i
found
that
my
heart
was
in
writing
q
where
do
you
go
for
vacation
a
i
do
go
on
vacation
really
i
sometimes
go
off
to
do
a
talk
and
i
try
to
make
that
a
little
vacation
i
work
in
the
last
seven
years
there
has
been
only
one
time
two
days
in
june
of
that
i
did
do
a
talk
and
even
then
i
took
some
paper
with
me
and
worked
on
a
murder
mystery
you
see
a
vacation
is
doing
what
you
want
to
do
and
to
stop
doing
what
you
have
to
do
but
i
like
what
i
do
so
i
on
vacation
days
a
year
if
i
had
to
play
volleyball
fish
etcetera
that
would
be
real
work
in
fact
the
irs
ca
believe
i
do
take
vacations
if
they
can
figure
out
how
to
write
one
book
a
month
and
still
take
vacations
i
do
travel
although
i
never
fly
last
year
i
crossed
the
ocean
on
the
qeii
without
stopping
but
i
gave
two
talks
each
way
and
i
wrote
a
book
q
since
you
live
week
three
blocks
of
lincoln
center
do
you
attend
the
performing
arts
a
i
am
a
very
person
i
am
fascinated
by
what
i
do
and
what
i
have
done
is
to
try
to
take
all
knowledge
for
my
province
but
i
have
tended
to
concentrate
on
science
mathematics
and
history
in
regard
to
art
i
ca
even
say
i
know
what
i
like
q
what
do
you
think
of
abolishing
mandatory
retirement
as
congress
is
considering
what
will
it
like
when
people
keep
working
indefinitely
a
that
was
the
condition
until
the
this
forced
retirement
is
a
product
of
the
great
depression
we
moving
back
to
situation
that
has
always
existed
for
mankind
which
is
to
let
people
work
as
long
as
they
can
if
the
birthrate
continues
to
go
down
the
percentage
of
young
people
will
be
smaller
i
think
that
computerization
and
automation
will
alter
completely
the
concept
of
what
is
work
we
not
going
to
think
of
jobs
the
same
way
as
we
used
to
q
do
you
think
you
could
ever
retire
a
there
might
well
come
a
time
if
i
live
long
enough
when
i
can
no
longer
write
publishable
material
then
i
will
have
to
write
for
my
own
amusement
rex
stout
last
book
was
written
when
he
was
years
old
wodehouse
was
writing
pretty
well
in
his
early
agatha
christie
was
falling
off
in
her
i
had
a
heart
attack
this
year
i
might
keep
writing
for
another
years
but
if
for
some
reason
i
am
no
longer
able
to
write
then
it
will
certainly
take
all
the
terrors
of
dying
away
so
there
will
be
that
silver
lining
so
far
i
detect
no
falling
off
of
my
abilities
in
fact
this
year
my
story
the
bicentennial
man
won
all
the
awards
is
there
anything
also
you
like
to
ask
me
said
asimov
when
i
had
run
out
of
questions
at
that
moment
the
telephone
rang
he
told
his
caller
that
no
he
would
regrettably
be
unable
to
accept
an
invitation
to
speak
at
virginia
because
it
was
too
far
to
go
by
grain
it
more
my
loss
than
yours
he
said
when
i
assured
asimov
that
there
were
no
more
questions
he
disappeared
into
his
study
and
emerged
with
a
copy
of
his
latest
science
fiction
book
the
bicentennial
man
and
other
stories
he
signed
it
and
presented
it
to
me
as
he
walked
me
to
the
elevator
he
took
a
peek
at
his
watch
his
parting
comment
was
let
see
i
have
to
be
downtown
at
that
gives
me
minutes
to
dress
and
minutes
to
write
westsider
george
balanchine
artistic
director
of
the
new
york
city
ballet
to
some
people
he
is
known
as
the
shakespeare
of
dance
a
title
that
he
probably
deserves
more
than
anyone
else
now
living
but
to
his
friends
and
colleagues
he
is
simply
b
george
balanchine
the
ageless
and
trained
choreographic
genius
whose
zest
for
living
is
matched
only
by
his
humility
and
his
sense
of
humor
balanchine
has
almost
transplanted
ballet
to
american
soil
and
made
it
flourish
what
more
he
has
played
the
central
role
in
making
new
york
the
dance
capital
of
the
world
which
it
undeniably
is
today
for
both
classical
and
modern
dance
now
in
his
consecutive
year
as
artistic
director
of
the
new
york
city
ballet
shows
no
signs
of
slowing
down
he
continues
to
direct
most
of
the
dances
for
his
company
and
to
create
new
choreographic
works
of
daring
originality
he
continues
to
teach
at
the
school
of
american
ballet
which
he
cofounded
in
with
lincoln
kirstein
and
balanchine
can
still
when
he
chooses
write
out
the
parts
for
all
the
instruments
of
the
orchestra
yet
he
thinks
of
himself
more
as
a
craftsman
than
a
creator
and
often
compares
his
work
to
that
of
a
cook
or
cabinetmaker
two
crafts
by
the
way
in
which
he
is
rather
skilled
i
meet
george
balanchine
backstage
at
the
new
york
state
theatre
during
an
intermission
of
one
of
the
season
first
ballets
it
not
hard
to
guess
which
man
is
balanchine
from
a
distance
because
as
usual
he
is
surrounded
by
young
dancers
when
he
turns
to
face
me
i
see
that
he
is
dressed
simply
but
with
a
touch
of
european
elegance
the
man
is
small
of
stature
and
quite
frail
in
appearance
his
english
is
strongly
accented
yet
easy
to
understand
a
smile
seems
to
be
forever
playing
on
his
lips
and
when
he
converses
with
someone
he
gives
that
person
his
full
undivided
attention
why
has
dance
become
so
popular
in
new
york
he
gazes
at
me
from
the
depths
of
his
eyes
i
do
know
why
people
get
used
to
us
it
took
years
to
train
new
york
he
says
with
feeling
maybe
you
can
train
los
angeles
you
can
not
train
boston
you
can
not
train
philadelphia
there
are
too
many
big
men
with
big
cigars
soon
he
is
improvising
on
the
theme
certainly
new
york
is
representative
of
america
all
america
should
pay
taxes
in
new
york
to
make
it
beautiful
because
in
europe
everybody
wants
to
be
in
new
york
to
show
off
i
think
that
i
will
suggest
to
senators
and
presidents
and
everybody
to
pay
taxes
to
new
york
b
who
left
his
native
petersburg
in
and
spent
the
next
nine
years
working
as
a
ballet
master
throughout
europe
was
persuaded
by
the
american
dance
connoisseur
lincoln
kirstein
to
come
to
the
in
since
then
balanchine
has
toured
the
world
with
the
new
york
city
ballet
he
finds
the
home
crowd
however
to
be
the
most
appreciative
we
are
here
weeks
he
explains
it
always
packed
in
paris
you
can
not
last
two
weeks
in
los
angeles
in
london
they
do
not
like
the
dance
so
much
as
here
in
san
francisco
there
were
five
people
in
the
audience
we
showed
them
everything
they
do
care
they
snobs
they
only
want
a
name
in
new
york
it
different
in
new
york
they
like
the
thing
for
itself
balanchine
does
not
write
down
his
dances
how
then
does
he
remember
such
works
as
which
he
created
almost
years
ago
and
revived
this
season
for
the
new
york
city
ballet
how
do
you
remember
prayers
he
says
in
response
you
just
remember
like
pepperidge
farm
i
know
pepperidge
farm
i
remember
everything
he
dislikes
excessive
terminology
i
used
to
be
a
dance
director
he
says
in
mock
lament
now
i
have
become
a
choreographer
choreographer
is
the
wrong
title
because
dance
is
like
poetry
see
in
which
the
biblical
story
is
danced
out
dramatically
is
an
example
of
a
ballet
with
a
plot
but
the
majority
of
balanchine
works
are
based
purely
on
music
and
movement
the
literary
thing
does
not
always
work
he
says
you
can
not
move
there
very
few
stories
you
can
do
tchaikovsky
and
stravinsky
are
the
composers
he
most
likes
to
use
for
new
dance
works
the
late
igor
stravinsky
a
fellow
russian
expatriate
who
was
his
longtime
friend
and
collaborator
once
described
choreography
as
a
series
of
dialogues
perfectly
complimentary
to
and
coordinated
with
the
dialogues
of
the
music
in
spite
of
his
fondness
for
russian
composers
balanchine
has
no
hesitation
in
naming
fred
astaire
as
his
favorite
dancer
no
i
do
use
his
ideas
because
he
an
individual
says
balanchine
you
can
not
use
his
ideas
because
only
he
can
dance
them
there
is
nobody
like
that
people
are
not
like
that
anymore
a
resident
of
west
street
balanchine
shows
even
more
than
his
usual
exuberance
when
speaking
of
the
west
side
it
the
best
side
like
the
rive
gauche
in
paris
we
have
the
best
hotels
like
the
empire
the
best
restaurants
le
poulailler
has
such
good
french
cooking
we
have
no
strikes
here
nothing
he
continues
grinning
widely
everybody
very
nice
friendly
they
help
each
other
i
invite
everybody
on
the
east
side
to
come
here
they
do
come
because
they
snobs
the
west
side
it
the
cleanest
side
also
there
is
no
crime
here
there
no
police
here
died
born
westsider
clive
barnes
drama
and
dance
critic
he
still
the
most
famous
drama
critic
in
america
if
not
the
world
his
name
has
not
yet
disappeared
from
the
subway
walls
or
from
the
signs
in
front
of
the
theatres
along
broadway
and
even
though
clive
barnes
was
recently
replaced
as
the
york
drama
critic
he
remains
the
authority
in
the
newspaper
ads
he
is
still
the
dance
critic
he
still
does
his
daily
radio
spot
on
theatre
for
wqxr
radio
he
still
lectures
around
the
country
and
writes
a
column
for
the
at
barnes
does
not
mind
the
slightly
calmer
pace
his
life
has
taken
i
do
know
why
i
was
replaced
he
says
papers
have
these
policy
decisions
i
suppose
they
wanted
a
change
they
wanted
to
split
the
two
desks
dance
and
drama
a
refined
affable
englishman
clive
barnes
welcomes
me
into
his
west
end
avenue
home
and
invites
me
to
sit
down
and
have
some
coffee
for
five
minutes
while
he
puts
the
finishing
touches
on
an
article
his
slim
attractive
wife
trish
and
his
son
christopher
talk
to
him
while
he
works
soon
the
article
is
finished
and
he
is
relaxed
in
an
armchair
ready
to
answer
questions
he
holds
a
pen
in
his
lap
and
occasionally
clicks
it
as
we
talk
really
i
much
prefer
new
york
to
london
says
barnes
who
spent
the
first
years
of
his
life
in
the
british
capital
i
never
leave
new
york
ever
when
i
first
came
here
visiting
before
i
came
here
to
live
i
adored
it
it
just
been
a
very
long
love
affair
between
myself
and
the
city
born
the
son
of
a
london
ambulance
driver
barnes
won
a
scholarship
to
oxford
university
and
while
a
student
there
began
to
write
reviews
on
theatre
and
dance
following
graduation
he
worked
in
city
planning
for
years
while
moonlighting
as
a
critic
of
theatre
dance
films
and
music
thus
he
built
up
a
reservoir
of
knowledge
in
all
the
major
performing
arts
in
several
years
after
barnes
got
into
journalism
he
was
doing
such
an
impressive
job
as
dance
critic
for
the
that
the
york
made
him
a
handsome
salary
offer
to
fill
the
same
role
for
them
two
years
later
the
offered
him
the
post
of
drama
critic
as
well
barnes
kept
the
dual
role
until
this
year
when
the
new
york
asked
him
to
concentrate
strictly
on
dance
certainly
american
dance
is
the
most
important
in
the
world
and
has
been
for
at
least
years
he
says
the
reason
for
this
is
that
you
have
a
very
strong
classical
tradition
as
well
as
a
very
strong
modern
dance
tradition
this
is
the
only
country
in
the
world
that
has
these
two
traditions
and
they
intermesh
so
that
you
have
george
balanchine
on
one
side
and
martha
graham
on
the
other
this
means
that
american
dance
is
astonishingly
rich
barnes
feels
that
americans
habits
have
made
them
more
appreciative
of
the
subtleties
of
dance
movement
that
same
kind
of
visual
orientation
that
has
made
spectator
sports
what
they
are
spins
off
and
spreads
over
to
things
like
dance
he
notes
that
dance
in
new
york
appeals
more
to
the
young
to
people
who
have
been
reared
on
television
broadway
audiences
on
the
other
hand
tend
to
be
menopausal
and
opera
audiences
to
be
geriatric
barnes
finds
the
west
side
the
ideal
place
to
live
because
of
its
proximity
to
his
work
trish
herself
an
expert
on
dance
usually
accompanies
him
to
performances
we
can
get
to
any
broadway
theatre
in
minutes
he
says
or
walk
to
lincoln
center
i
can
get
to
the
paper
in
about
minutes
the
west
side
has
changed
a
little
over
the
years
i
think
it
gotten
rather
nice
on
nights
off
barnes
enjoys
going
to
the
metropolitan
opera
or
to
a
movie
his
son
christopher
loves
rock
music
and
hates
drama
he
also
has
a
daughter
maya
the
family
enjoys
dining
at
many
restaurants
in
the
lincoln
center
area
including
le
poulailler
on
street
near
columbus
i
ask
barnes
if
he
can
think
of
any
plays
that
have
been
forced
to
close
because
of
unkind
reviews
that
would
presume
it
was
an
important
play
which
the
critics
misunderstood
and
killed
he
says
i
do
think
this
has
actually
happened
a
play
that
gets
awful
notices
by
everyone
is
not
the
victim
of
a
vast
critical
conspiracy
it
usually
a
bad
play
harold
pinter
birthday
got
bad
notices
in
london
but
it
recovered
and
went
on
and
became
successful
for
those
who
miss
barnes
views
on

biggest

has
no
complaints
about
being

of

it
very
enjoyable

westsider
franz
beckenbauer
north
america
most
valuable
soccer
player
last
october
when
brazilian
soccer
virtuoso
played
his
final
game
as
a
professional
nearly
fans
filed
into
giant
stadium
in
east
rutherford
new
jersey
to
bid
farewell
to
the
man
who
had
almost
single
handedly
transformed
soccer
into
a
major
american
sport
it
was
a
fitting
cap
to
career
that
his
team
the
cosmos
won
the
north
american
soccer
league
championship
last
season
over
other
teams
but
while
the
brazilian
superstar
was
reaping
most
of
the
publicity
one
of
his
teammates
franz
beckenbauer
was
quietly
getting
things
done
it
was
probably
he
more
than
anyone
else
who
won
the
title
for
the
cosmos
not
by
scoring
goals
but
by
controlling
the
midfield
with
his
pinpoint
touch
passes
and
setting
up
the
offense
to
go
in
for
the
shot
in
may
he
shocked
the
sports
world
by
quitting
his
west
german
team
bayern
munich
and
signing
a
million
contract
to
play
with
the
cosmos
for
four
years
and
though
he
missed
of
the
season
franz
still
received
last
year
most
valuable
player
award
for
a
league
encompassing
players
from
around
the
world
this
season
again
thanks
largely
to
his
efforts
the
cosmos
clinched
their
division
title
and
are
a
heavy
favorite
to
repeat
their
victory
in
the
soccer
bowl
the
super
bowl
of
soccer
this
year
the
soccer
bowl
will
be
held
in
giant
stadium
on
august
to
be
in
that
game
the
cosmos
must
first
win
in
the
playoffs
which
begin
on
august
beckenbauer
is
so
famous
in
germany
that
he
finds
it
impossible
to
lead
a
private
life
there
his
fame
is
well
deserved
franz
starred
for
the
west
german
national
team
in
the
world
cup
finals
and
the
semifinals
and
captained
the
team
when
it
won
the
world
cup
in
during
his
seasons
with
bayern
munich
of
the
german
soccer
league
he
was
named
german
footballer
of
the
year
four
times
and
european
footballer
of
the
year
twice
and
was
on
two
other
occasions
but
franz
is
somewhat
of
a
quiet
shy
man
who
does
not
like
the
limelight
in
new
york
he
can
be
himself
and
walk
the
streets
undisturbed
thinking
about
his
wife
and
three
children
in
switzerland
who
will
be
joining
him
this
month
for
a
long
visit
i
meet
franz
on
a
july
afternoon
after
a
practice
at
giant
stadium
as
we
sit
talking
in
the
locker
room
many
of
his
teammates
walk
by
and
wave
to
him
or
call
his
name
he
is
an
extremely
popular
fellow
both
on
and
off
the
field
which
explains
why
people
showed
up
for
a
game
last
may
commemorating
franz
beckenbauer
day
with
his
courtly
manners
he
has
rightfully
earned
the
nickname
kaiser
franz
he
could
speak
almost
no
english
when
he
arrived
in
new
york
less
than
two
years
ago
at
the
age
of
but
has
learned
remarkably
quickly
my
mind
was
soccer
in
the
united
states
it
easier
to
play
but
it
not
so
easy
as
i
expect
he
says
in
his
slightly
hesitant
but
perfectly
understandable
speech
you
have
so
different
things
like
astroturf
you
have
to
play
in
the
summertime
it
so
hot
you
have
to
make
big
trips
like
to
los
angeles
sometimes
it
more
difficult
to
play
here
than
in
europe
when
asked
to
compare
soccer
with
american
football
he
says
you
ca
compare
it
a
much
different
sport
as
an
american
footballer
you
must
be
not
a
normal
man
you
must
be
maybe
pounds
and
foot
foot
or
everybody
can
play
soccer
big
tall
small
if
he
is
skilled
enough
if
he
has
the
brain
to
play
i
started
when
i
was
years
old
i
do
know
exactly
but
you
know
after
the
war
nobody
has
money
soccer
is
the
cheapest
sport
no
courts
nothing
so
we
all
start
to
play
soccer
and
after
i
was
years
old
i
went
to
a
little
club
in
munich
when
i
was
years
old
i
moved
to
bayern
munich
and
when
i
was
i
was
a
professional
franz
smiles
at
the
mention
of
manhattan
when
i
signed
the
contract
they
asked
me
where
i
wanted
to
stay
in
the
suburbs
i
said
no
i
want
to
stay
in
the
city
a
friend
of
mine
knows
a
businessman
who
lives
beside
the
central
park
he
is
most
of
the
year
outside
the
country
the
apartment
was
free
and
he
let
me
have
it
for
six
months
i
was
very
lucky
i
like
to
walk
around
the
park
to
watch
the
people
i
have
been
to
lincoln
center
a
few
times
and
of
course
different
shows
on
broadway
but
i
never
saw
a
city
like
new
york
you
have
so
many
good
restaurants
it
unbelievable
during
the
franz
does
some
promotional
work
for
both
and
adidas
the
sporting
goods
company
that
manufactures
among
other
things
a
franz
beckenbauer
soccer
shoe
as
a
result
franz
who
will
be
next
month
is
not
at
all
worried
about
his
future
you
know
when
i
started
with
soccer
as
a
professional
he
explains
i
had
an
aim
i
said
when
i
finished
with
soccer
my
life
will
be
different
i
can
say
want
to
do
this
and
this
and
not
must
do
this
when
i
finish
my
career
i
would
like
to
go
through
the
united
states
in
a
mobile
with
my
family
to
see
all
the
states
that
for
sure
westsider
himan
brown
creator
of
the
radio
mystery
during
the
a
comedy
called
rise
of
the
was
second
only
to
as
the
most
popular
radio
show
in
america
its
success
was
due
largely
to
the
efforts
of
a
young
man
from
brooklyn
named
himan
brown
who
the
series
sold
it
to
nbc
and
did
the
voice
of
goldberg
he
had
started
in
radio
drama
while
in
his
teens
and
soon
after
graduating
from
brooklyn
law
school
as
valedictorian
decided
to
make
radio
not
law
his
career
during
the
next
three
decades
as
producer
of
sanctum
thin
central
and
other
series
brown
became
the
norman
lear
of
radio
but
by
it
was
all
over
the
last
network
radio
drama
was
forced
off
the
air
by
the
onslaught
of
television
brown
however
kept
up
a
personal
crusade
for
radio
pounding
on
the
desks
of
every
broadcast
executive
he
could
reach
fourteen
years
later
in
january
his
dream
was
realized
and
radio
drama
was
reborn
with
the
radio
mystery
the
show
it
turned
out
was
long
overdue
within
weeks
cbs
received
fan
letters
from
listeners
currently
the
mystery
can
be
heard
in
new
york
on
monday
through
friday
at
on
station
wmca
am
it
is

seven
nights

approximately
other

across
the
country
brown
the
oversees
every
phase
of
the
operation
from
hiring
the
writers
and
actors
to
directing
and
recording
sessions
from
a
control
booth
at
the
cbs
studios
i
have
never
stopped
believing
he
says
that
the
spoken
word
and
the
imagination
of
the
listener
are
infinitely
stronger
and
more
dramatic
than
anything
television
can
offer
he
is
a
distinguished
looking
gentleman
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
hie
eye
and
an
endless
capacity
for
humor
and
vigorous
dressed
in
a
gray
pinstripe
suit
and
a
crimson
tie
he
approaches
his
work
with
an
infectious
enthusiasm
on
a
typical
weekday
brown
arrives
at
the
sound
studio
at
with
a
batch
of
scripts
under
his
arm
which
he
hands
out
to
a
group
of
actors
assembled
around
a
table
many
are
stars
of
the
stage
or

i
get
the
best
actors
in
the
world
right
here
in
new

he
notes
with
pride
they
work
for
me
in
the
daytime
and
on
broadway
at
night
as
the
cast
members
go
through
a
cold
reading
brown
interjects
his
comments
do
a
little
more
with
that
do
swallow
your
words
there
cross
out
that
line
the
actors
laugh
and
joke
their
way
through
the
session
brown
is
the
biggest
jokester
of
all
finally
everyone
takes
a
break
before
doing
the
actual
taping
brown
calls
his
mother
on
the
telephone
and
speaks
to
her
in
yiddish
for
some
time
then
he
answers
a
questions
about
his
discoveries
in
sound
effects
in
the
i
was
doing
a
very
popular
show
for
sound
effects
we
had
several
doors
one
of
them
screaked
no
matter
what
we
did
to
it
i
like
to
think
that
door
was
talking
to
us
saying
me
a
star
he
says
with
a
smile
the
creaking
door
later
became
the
signature
for
sanctum
and
is
now
employed
as
the
introductory
note
for
the
mystery
along
with
host
marshall
compelling
greeting
come
himan
brown
also
created
the
sound
of
london
foghorns
and
big
ben
for
the
laugh
of
the
fat
nero
wolfe
and
the
train
that
roared
under
park
avenue
into
grand
central
station
when
the
recording
session
get
underway
brown
observes
the
performers
through
the
thick
glass
of
the
control
booth
as
they
stand
around
a
microphone
reading
their
line
with
animation
from
time
to
time
he
stops
the
action
and
repeats
parts
of
a
scene
it
all
spliced
together
afterwards
he
explains
in
the
late
brown
began
to
produce
television
dramas
such
as
and
the
mystery
he
built
a
large
tv
studio
on
west
street
for
that
purpose
which
for
many
years
he
has
leased
to
cbs
for
filming
the
soap

for
most
of
his
career
brown

and
charitable
organizations
including
the
federation
of
jewish
philanthropies
the
national
urban

and
the

of

work
brown
is
constantly
in
demand
as
a
public
speaker
a
and
a
creator
of
multimedia
presentations
his
plans
for
include
reviving
the
a
radio
with
that
he
last
did
in
the
best
thing
about
radio
drama
he
joyfully
concludes
is
that
we
can
take
you
anywhere
unhampered
by
sets
production
costs
locations
makeup
costumes
or
memorizing
lines
and
make
you
believe
everything
we
put
on

air
the
screen
in
your
head
is
much
bigger
than
the
biggest
giant
screen
ever
made
it
gives
you
an
experience
no
other
form
of
theatre
can
duplicate
it
the
theatre
of
the
mind
ferris
butler
creator
writer
and
producer
of
meat
every
saturday
at
millions
of
americans
tune
in
to
what
is
indisputably
the
boldest
the
most
innovative
and
frequently
the
most
tasteless
comedy
show
on
television
nbc
night
but
for
the
residents
of
manhattan
who
have
cable
tv
there
is
another
program
also
aired
at
but
on
sunday
evening
that
is
in
its
own
way
even
more
offbeat
known
as
meat
the
satiric
revue
has
been
a
regular
feature
of
channel
d
since
april
when
a
young
westsider
named
ferris
butler
decided
that
he
had
the
talent
to
write
direct
and
produce
his
own
comedy
series
even
without
money
and
film
equipment
time
has
proven
him
right
last
year
magazine
discovered
in
a
poll
of
viewers
that
meat
is
the
most
popular
comedy
program
on
cable
out
of
public
access
shows
a
tall
willowy
with
a
quizzical
expression
permanently
fixed
on
his
face
ferris
once
worked
as
a
office
boy
at
channel
and
there
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
tv
news
is
nothing
but
throwaway
scraps
like
sausages
or
hot
dogs
very
little
protein
like
waste
meat
many
of
the
skits
he
conceives
have
the
same
format
as
straight
news
items
but
have
been
twisted
by
his
imagination
into
something
outrageous
in
place
of
the
standard
weather
reports
for
example
there
is
ferris
leather
weather
girl
in
which
a
girl
is
tied
to
a
table
her
body
representing
a
map
of
the
world
the
weather
reporter
while
telling
about
an
impending
onslaught
of
rain
and
snow
dramatizes
his
points
by
pouring
a
pitcher
of
water
over
the
girl
smothering
her
with
shaving
cream
and
finally
applying
a
blow
dryer
to
evaporate
the
messes
while
explaining
that
a
warm
air
front
will
follow
other
skits
include
swedish
grease
music
to
eat
rice
by
and
the
adversaries
in
which
two
actors
wearing
grotesque
masks
debate
the
question
should
monsters
be
allowed
to
kill
people
or
just
frighten
them
ideas
for
skits
says
ferris
come
to
him
any
time
of
night
or
day
now
that
he
has
stopped
working
at
any
legitimate
job
i
watch
a
lot
of
television
but
most
of
the
time
i
meander
around
the
streets
and
just
think
i
remember
when
i
got
the
idea
for
the
foreign
language
cursing
detector
i
was
sitting
on
a
bench
in
the
park
smoking
grass
when
some
foreign
tourists
came
and
sat
down
and
started
talking
about
me
in
german
like
i
was
a
bum
and
i
thought
why
not
have
a
portable
siren
that
goes
off
whenever
a
swear
word
is
spoken
in
any
language
he
describes
himself
as
a
very
unregimented
person
who
ca
jive
with
the
mainstream
industry
this
accounts
for
much
of
the
spontaneity
in
meat
the
performers
sometimes
do
see
the
scripts
until
the
taping
session
each
segment
requires
several
before
it
is
smooth
enough
to
be
filmed
frequently
the
filming
goes
on
far
into
the
night
although
the
show
is
done
with
a
single
camera
and
videotape
the
final
result
makes
up
in
charm
what
it
lacks
in
professional
gloss
maybe
i
a
little
rough
in
the
way
i
produce
it
says
ferris
but
being
a
pioneer
and
i
not
worried
about
perfection
as
long
as
the
audience
has
a
positive
reaction
his
cast
is
an
irregular
group
of
about
unpaid
actors
and
actresses
most
of
them
young
two
current
stars
of
meat
are
pat
profito
a
master
of
comedy
who
injects
an
infectious
vitality
into
all
of
his
performances
and
laura
suarez
a
actress
and
former
playboy
bunny
who
frequently
portrays
the
naive
sexpot
who
crops
up
in
many
of
ferris
sketches
most
of
the
filming
is
done
on
the
upper
west
side
usually
on
the
street
or
in
someone
apartment
but
also
in
such
diverse
places
as
stores
restaurants
the
waterfront
boiler
rooms
and
lobbies
a
recent
skit
was
shot
at
a
westside
swimming
pool
it
features
pat
profito
as
a
swimming
instructor
who
teaches
three
beauties
his
method
in
which
he
pushes
them
into
the
pool
and
expects
them
to
swim
instinctively
or
drown

sammy

lyricist
i
never
written

that
did
almost
write

one
of

most
successful
lyricists
of
popular
songs
like
the

it
like
i
start
the
boulder
down

but
after
that
there
only
one
place
it
can
go
i
always
thrilled
by
the
adventure
of
finding
the
lyric
and
leading
it
to
a
happy
conclusion
if
i
come
to
the
slightest
impasse
i
learned
to
stop
and
look
around
and
see
what
needs
to
be
done
around

house
then
i
come
back

it
so
easy
you

wiry
and
energetic
he
describes

as

he
is
utterly
without
pretension
and
seems

much
at
home
with
strangers
on
the
street
as
he
is
with
royalty
last
year
he
sang
for

of
his
time
to

the
eighth

of
one
times
square
it

he
recently
met
with
the
producer
of
the
broadway
musical
to
discuss
writing
a
new
musical
he
gives
generously
to
many
charitable
causes
but
the
majority
of
his
time
these
days
goes
to
writing
and
performing
special
lyrics
for
special
occasions
usually
parodies
of
his
own
hit
songs
sometimes
he
does
this
for
profit
and
sometimes
for
love
he
was
paid
handsomely
to
prepare
a
birthday
celebration
for
ray
kroc
the
head
of
mcdonald
but
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
when
a
man
wrote
to
sammy
telling
him
how
much
his
songs
had
meant
to
him
and
his
wife
over
the
years
and
asking
him
to
please
write
some
personalized
lyrics
for
their
wedding
anniversary
sammy
was
just
enough
of
an
idiot
to
sit
down
and
do
it
he
works
exclusively
at
the
typewriter
i
have
become
almost
audacious
when
i
put
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
typewriter
i
know
that
the
completed
song
will
be
on
that
page
i
very
grateful
to
the
man
who
invented
correctotype
and
liquid
paper
i
start
to
type
as
soon
as
i
get
up
and
i
think
about
songs
all
day
long
when
i
sleep
at
night
i
sleep
with
an
earplug
in
my
ear
tuned
to
wcbs
or
wins
radio
they
both
news
stations
the
radio
distracts
me
it
stops
me
from
thinking
about
lyrics
as
we
are
talking
sammy
keeps
remembering
telephone
calls
he
needs
to
make
but
he
keeps
them
brief
and
to
the
point
as
soon
as
he
hangs
up
our
conversation
jumps
immediately
back
to
the
previous
subject
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
he
is
extremely
to
the
extent
that
his
thoughts
sometimes
race
ahead
of
him
and
his
sentences
lose
their
structure
in
speaking
of
his
son
a
very
successful
jazz
guitarist
who
performs
under
the
name
steve
khan
sammy
comments
now
my
son
brace
yourself
my
son
this
is
one
of
my
great
great
achievements
my
fame
is
coming
from
a
very
curious
source
people
come
up
to
me
and
say
steve
kahn
father
asked
about
the
satisfaction
he
has
gotten
from
songwriting
sammy
insists
that
he
ca
imagine
a
more
rewarding
career
i
once
told
that
to
a
college
audience
and
a
boy
said
studying
to
be
a
lawyer
wrong
with
that
i
said
but
who
walks
down
the
street
humming
a
lawsuit
westsider
hugh
carey
governor
of
new
york
state
it
was
on
the
friday
before
labor
day
governor
hugh
carey
sat
alone
in
his
office
on
west
street
rubbing
his
forehead
wearily
with
both
hands
when
his
assistant
press
secretary
judy
deich
ushered
me
in
the
introductions
were
brief
and
the
governor
spoke
very
rapidly
keeping
is
eyes
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
where
he
was
scrawling
pencil
lines
in
geometric
patterns
on
a
piece
of
blank
paper
as
if
to
maintain
his
concentration
the
governor
had
been
up
for
hours
and
his
voice
occasionally
faded
to
a
whisper
but
he
answered
all
the
questions
with
a
flair
and
displayed
a
sincere
manner
throughout
sitting
to
me
at
a
conference
table
he
looked
smaller
and
thinner
than
his
photographs
he
also
looked
like
one
of
the
tiredest
most
overworked
men
i
had
ever
met
i
have
been
staying
on
the
west
side
a
lot
since
last
september
he
said
that
when
my
sons
donald
and
michael
got
an
apartment
near
central
park
they
kind
enough
to
put
me
up
there
we
have
the
usual
complaints
about
the
leaky
ceilings
and
peeling
paint
all
in
all
it
a
good
building
i
find
more
and
more
advantages
to
living
on
the
west
side
i
like
it
because
of
the
accessibility
to
work
and
because
i
jog
in
central
park
one
of
my
headaches
is
central
park
some
of
my
colleagues
would
like
to
make
it
a
national
park
it
the
city
biggest
showplace
i
want
to
get
the
automobiles
out
of
there
more
and
more
in
the
morning
i
see
all
the
new
jersey
cars
coming
through
that
why
i
want
westway
below
street
so
it
will
take
more
pressure
off
the
city
i
wish
everyone
would
realize
that
westway
is
not
a
road
it
a
recessed
highway
more
of
a
tunnel
speaking
frankly
of
the
problem
of
patients
in
parts
of
the
west
side
carey
said
that
we
have
indexed
all
the
sro
that
was
never
done
before
the
homeless
people
who
live
on
the
street
are
not
the
wards
of
the
state
we
ca
just
go
out
and
pick
them
up
if
they
need
some
kind
of
health
care
they
should
be
taken
to
a
shelter
and
given
health
care
if
they
resist
we
will
have
peace
officers
to
take
care
of
them
that
something
i
doing
with
mayor
koch
ever
since
he
defeated
nelson
rockefeller
appointed
successor
malcolm
wilson
in
hugh
carey
has
become
well
known
for
both
his
conservative
moral
code
and
his
unswerving
fiscal
restraint
born
on
april
to
an
irish
catholic
family
in
brooklyn
carey
grew
up
with
five
brothers
believing
in
certain
principles
that
he
has
never
abandoned
these
moral
principles
have
become
the
foundation
of
his
controversial
stands
on
the
death
penalty
and
abortion
i
am
against
the
death
penalty
said
carey
because
the
government
can
make
a
mistake
a
sentence
of
life
without
parole
is
better
there
are
six
people
now
walking
around
the
state
who
were
condemned
to
death
and
later
proven
innocent
one
is
named
zimmy
and
he
works
on
the
west
side
in
a
garment
factory
somebody
should
ask
him
what
he
thinks
about
the
death
penalty
he
alive
because
somebody
confessed
i
oppose
abortion
personally
but
the
supreme
court
upheld
that
it
the
choice
of
a
woman
of
her
own
free
will
and
i
support
that
ruling
in
new
york
the
state
pays
for
it
if
it
a
matter
of
medical
necessity
otherwise
there
might
be
a
mangled
body
in
a
back
alley
i
also
advocating
an
alternative
a
teenage
pregnancy
bill
where
girls
can
have
a
baby
without
shame
and
go
back
to
school
it
the
most
common
reason
for
dropouts
among
teenagers
during

war
ii
hugh
carey
fought
in
france
belgium
holland
and
germany
and
attained
the
rank
of
major
after
the
service
he
worked
for
many
years
as
an
executive
in
his
brother
edward
peerless
oil
and
chemical
corporation
not
until
when
he
was
years
old
did
carey
decide
to
run
for
political
office
he
won
his
first
congressional
race
and
during
the
developed
a
national
reputation
for
his
liberal
attitude
on
education
and
programs
for
the
elderly
and
handicapped
his
life
has
twice
been
touched
by
deep
personal
tragedy
in
recent
years
an
automobile
accident
in
took
the
lives
of
his
two
eldest
sons
and
cancer
claimed
his
wife
helen
in
a
man
who
loves
the
company
of
other
people
carey
enjoys
such
simple
pleasures
as
cooking
with
friends
and
singing
with
his
children
asked
about
the
chief
difference
between
himself
and
republican
challenger
perry
duryea
the
governor
replied
with
obvious
glee
i
think
of
anything
we
have
in
common
i
knock
the
y
right
out
of
his
name
before
i
finished
generally
known
to
be
at
his
best
in
times
of
crisis
carey
said
that
whenever
the
pressures
of
his
office
become
too
great
for
him
to
handle
alone
he
drops
into
the
chapel
and
asks
for
help
it
a
matter
of
privacy
to
me
i
go
where
i
not
seen
he
said
i
need
help
quite
a
lot
also
i
believe
that
new
york
is
a
very
special
place
with
a
resourcefulness
that
ca
be
matched
anywhere
in
the
world
when
people
have
come
together
as
new
yorkers
they
have
done
amazing
things

craig
claiborne

editor
of
the
york
to
be
a
good
restaurant
critic
you
should
have
a
conscience
says
craig
claiborne
food
editor
of
the
york
i
used
to
visit
restaurants
twice
a
day
frequently
seven
days
a
week
and
lie
awake
brooding
about
whether
my
reviews
were
honest
whether
i
was
hurting
somebody
who
did
deserve
to
be
hurt
recognized
throughout
the
united
states
as
the
father
of
modern
restaurant
criticism
claiborne
joined
the
in
and
shortly
thereafter
was
given
the
to
write
reviews
based
on
a
system
the
york
made
the
decision
i
was
the
instrument
it
was
the
first
newspaper
that
allowed
a
restaurant
critic
to
say
anything
he
wanted
it
took
a
lot
of
guts
when
a
newspaper
depends
on
advertising
a
bachelor
whose
soft
voice
still
carries
strong
traces
of
his
native
mississippi
claiborne
has
few
of
the
characteristics
generally
imagined
of
a
timesman
he
is
a
true
bon
vivant
and
does
not
appear
to
take
himself
or
his
work
too
seriously
he
prefers
to
be
called
by
his
first
name
is
not
a
particularly
fashionable
dresser
and
spends
as
little
time
as
possible
in
manhattan
in
his
lighter
moods
such
as
that
in
which
i
find
him
on
the
day
of
our
interview
he
delights
in
telling
jokes
that
are
classics
of
schoolyard
humor
the
punch
line
more
often
than
not
is
drowned
by
his
own
uproarious
laughter
although
he
has
maintained
a
westside
apartment
for
the
past
nine
years
claiborne
spends
most
of
his
time
at
his
house
in
east
hampton
long
island
next
door
to
pierre
franey
one
of
the
greatest
french
chefs
in
america
who
since
has
claiborne
food
articles
for
the
york
sunday
magazine
recently
he
purchased
a
larger
more
modern
house
about
minutes
from
franey
which
he
plans
to
occupy
shortly
the
pair
cook
together
about
five
times
a
week
claiborne
calls
the
house
my
taj
mahal
my
xanadu
he
explains
his
jovial
mood
by
saying
that
the
night
before
he
attended
a
big
dinner
party
for
restaurateur
joe
baum
at
the
four
seasons
it
was
an
dinner
jim
beard
brought
bread
i
brought
saviche
marinated
raw
fish
and
gael
greene
brought
some
chocolate
dessert
i
got
roaring
drunk
in
spite
of
his
earthiness
claiborne
unquestionably
ranks
as
one
of
the
leading
food
authorities
of
his
time
his
articles
which
appear
in
the
each
monday
wednesday
and
sunday
cover
every
subject
from
the
particulars
of
a
dinner
for
chinese
teng
in
washington
where
claiborne
saw
a
rock
group
he
had
never
heard
of
called
the
osmonds
to
the
six
most
creative
ways
of
preparing
scallops
he
has
written
numerous
cookbooks
and
he
often
travels
around
the
world
on
missions
claiborne
rise
from
obscurity
to
the
most
prestigious
food
job
in
america
astonished
no
one
more
than
himself
since
his
principal
qualifications
were
a
in
journalism
and
one
year
training
at
a
hotel
and
restaurant
school
in
switzerland
however
the
knew
exactly
what
they
were
looking
for
when
jane
nickerson
retired
in
and
claiborne
quickly
proved
to
be
the
man
of
the
hour
he
threw
himself
into
his
work
with
boundless
energy
writing
no
less
than
five
columns
a
week
but
his
relationship
with
the
newspaper
eventually
became
a
love
hate
affair
things
came
to
the
point
where
i
could
go
to
a
restaurant
at
night
unless
i
came
home
here
and
had
at
least
four
scotch
and
sodas
and
four
martinis
and
at
this
point
i
took
myself
off
to
africa
i
stayed
at
the
stanley
hotel
in
kenya
and
i
came
back
and
said
me
my
benefits
i
quitting
this
place
they
thought
i
was
kidding
he
was
claiborne
left
the
paper
for
almost
two
years
then
the
came
to
me
and
said
you
come
back
under
any
circumstances
and
i
must
confess
that
i
felt
a
great
emotional
relief
he
agreed
to
return
if
the
paper
would
have
someone
else
do
the
local
restaurant
reviews
he
also
requested
that
his
neighbor
and
cooking
partner
pierre
franey
share
the
sunday
byline
the
conditions
were
immediately
met
claiborne
westside
apartment
is
painted
green
from
floor
to
ceiling
thus
fulfilling
an
old
fantasy
of
his
he
describes
the
apartment
itself
as
gently
shabby
but
says
that
the
building
constructed
in
is
the
greatest
residency
in
the
entire
island
of
manhattan
you
from
carnegie
hall
you
six
minutes
by
foot
from
lincoln
center
you
can
walk
to
any
place
on
broadway
within
seconds
and
there
are
very
few
restaurants
you
could
get
to
within
five
minutes
of
this
place
his
favorite
restaurant
in
all
of
manhattan
is
the
shun
lee
palace
while
two
other
favorites
on
the
west
side
are
the
russian
tea
room
and
the
fuji
restaurant
asked
about
other
interests
or
hobbies
claiborne
smiles
mischievously
and
replies
i
having
a
bolton
stereo
system

into
my
new
xanadu
you
can
clap
your
hands
and

westsider
marc
connelly
actor
director
producer
novelist
and
pulitzer
dramatist
eleven
years
ago
during
my
senior
year
in
high
school
i
saw
a
movie
just
before
christmas
that
made
a
deep
impression
it
was
a
film
of
a
stage
play
called
green
a
fascinating
look
at
life
in
biblical
times
performed
by
an
cast
the
memory
of
that
film
remained
in
my
consciousness
like
a
religious
experience
although
i
never
knew
who
wrote
the
play
or
when
it
was
written
so
it
was
a
welcome
surprise
to
learn
that
this
week
interview
would
be
with
the
play
author
marc
connelly
connelly
was
born
in
a
small
pennsylvania
town
in
the
son
of
a
pair
of
travelling
actors
he
wrote
green
in
it
won
that
year
pulitzer
prize
for
drama
in
his
career
connelly
has
written
dozens
of
plays
one
of
the
most
versatile
talents
in
the
american
theatre
he
has
excelled
as
an
actor
director
producer
playwriting
professor
at
yale
and
popular
lecturer
he
has
written
musicals
stage
plays
movie
scripts
and
radio
plays
he
was
one

the
original
staff
members
of

magazine
and
became
part
of
the
famous
round
table
at
the
algonquin
hotel

of
his
short
stories

an
henry

an
active
playwright
he
lives
peacefully
at
central
park
west
comfortable
in
his
role
as
an
elder
statesman
of
american
letters
i
feel
a
certain
freedom
about
repeating
the
comments
connelly
made
during
our
interview
because
the
first
thing
he
said
at
the
door
was
i
never
read
anything
about
myself
it
not
modesty
it
more
terror
for
fear
that
some
dark
secret
will
emerge
yes
he
said
he
very
busy
these
days
i
just
completed
a
comedy
which
i
waiting
to
have
done
i
rather
not
mention
the
title
before
it
comes
out
it
a
comic
fantasy
he
recently
taped
an
appearance
on
the
cavett
which
will
be
aired
sometime
this
month
and
he
working
on
a
musical
version
of
takes
a
a
broadway
play
that
he
in
it
became
a
successful
film
the
next
year
with
henry
fonda
screen
premiere
they
always
reviving
my
plays
last
summer
they
did
of
the
which
he
wrote
with
george
kaufman
in
in
that
big
theatre
complex
in
los
angeles
it
was
quite
successful
the
boy
that
plays
on
the
waltons
played
merton
it
was
quite
good
i
went
to
see
it
much
as
connelly
dislikes
certain
tv
shows
he
thinks
very
highly
of
tv
as
a
medium
it
good
it
good
i
like
three
or
four
shows
is
wonderful
i
like
every
now
and
then
and
carol
burnett
i
might
like
if
it
did
run
every
five
minutes
three
times
a
night
is
too
much
for
any
tv
show
any
anecdotes
about
the
vicious
circle
of
the
algonquin
hotel
whose
members
included
robert
benchley
dorothy
parker
edna
ferber
alexander
woollcott
and
george
kaufman
oh
i
do
want
to
talk
about
the
round
table
he
said
every
time
you
turn
around
there
a
new
book
about
the
round
table
i
written
about
george
kaufman
and
so
have
a
hundred
other
people
it
might
be
that
he
might
get
out
of
his
grave
and
club
us
all
for
writing
about
him
although
green
is
considered
an
american
classic
it
is
now
performed
only
by
school
and
amateur
companies
its
depiction
of
plantation
life
has
become
offensive
to
socially
conscious
blacks
there
are
negro
snobs
explained
connelly
just
like
there
are
irish
snobs
and
jewish
snobs
as
soon
as
people
get
in
a
position
of
economic
power
they
become
sensitive
about
the
way
they
are
shown
on
the
stage
it
a
very
human
inevitable
reaction
however
he
thinks
that
his
masterwork
is
as
valid
today
as
ever
it
a
statement
about
the
fact
that
man
has
been
hunting
the
divine
in
himself
ever
since
he
became
a
conscious
animal
and
this
is
the
story
of
one
aspect
of
his
search
for
the
divine
in
himself
connelly
attends
broadway
when
there
something
i
feel
i
want
to
see
i
walk
out
on
quite
a
few
theatre
is
just
as
strong
today
a
seasonal
crop
may
be
poor
but
theatre
itself
is
healthy
it
probably
the
greatest
social
instrument
man
ever
invented
all
religions
have
sprung
from
the
theatre
a
westsider
since
about
marc
connelly
named
schwartz
candy
store
on
west
as
one
of
his
favorite
neighborhood
businesses
one
of
the
finest
candy
shops
in
new
york
he
said
you
can
see
my
portrait
there
and
the
a
p
at
and
broadway
there
a
checkout
girl
there
named
noreen
who
one
of
the
best
checkout
girls
in
america
the
interview
came
to
an
end
when
i
again
asked
connelly
about
television
does
he
approve
of
it
of
course
he
said
any
new
public
addition
is
going
to
be
condemned
they
used
to
say
go
to
the
movies
you
go
blind
we
not
blind
and
we
still
watch
them
eastsider
tony
craig
star
of
edge
of
although
los
angeles
has
long
since
taken
over
tv
programming
new
york
is
still
the
headquarters
for
daytime
drama
also
known
as
soap
opera
of
the
soaps
are
filmed
in
new
york
and
of
these
five
have
been
on
the
small
screen
since
the
including
edge
of
which
debuted
in
the
show
format
has
not
changed
much
over
the
years
but
one
thing
that
has
changed
of
course
is
the
cast
of
characters
tony
craig
who
plays
attorney
draper
scott
joined
the
show
in
november
and
since
then
he
has
become
one
of
the
most
popular
male
stars
in
daytime
television
tony
owes
his
success
not
only
to
his
good
looks
and
his
acting
ability
but
also
to
his
likable
personality
upon
meeting
tony
on
the
set
of
edge
of
during
a
busy
shooting
session
i
can
not
help
noticing
the
affection
that
the
other
cast
members
display
toward
him
his
ability
to
get
along
with
everyone
involved
with
the
show
especially
producer
nick
nicholson
and
headwriter
henry
slesar
has
enabled
tony
to
develop
the
role
of
draper
scott
into
one
of
the
four
leading
characters
i
was
given
a
piece
of
advice
when
i
started
says
tony
one
keep
to
your
business
and
do
what
you
told
and
two
answer
your
fan
mail
i
answer
all
my
fan
mail
with
a
very
personal
response
in
the
i
once
said
i
was
looking
for
miss
right
and
i
got
inundated
with
letters
some
people
sent
plane
ticket
asking
me
to
come
and
see
them
as
we
sit
down
to
talk
in
one
of
the
dressing
rooms
tony
puts
on
a
tie
and
jacket
for
an
upcoming
bar
scene
but
because
only
his
top
half
will
be
shown
on
camera
he
does
not
bother
to
change
out
of
his
blue
jeans
and
running
shoes
tall
athletically
built
and
boyish
in
appearance
he
discusses
his
work
with
an
infectious
enthusiasm
the
closer
i
get
to
the
character
the
more
i
see
that
he
and
i
are
very
much
alike
says
tony
in
his
rapid
speech
it
funny
the
way
assimilated
him
and
he
assimilated
me
it
like
the
dummy
in
the
character
has
gone
from
a
very
impetuous
aggressive
almost
nasty
young
man
to
a
very
quiet
strong
very
reserved
lawyer
it
changed
to
the
point
where
i
a
pillar
of
the
community
whenever
there
a
problem
call
draper
i
think
i
allow
tony
a
little
more
anger
a
little
more
frustration
than
draper
allows
himself
i
very
normal
i
very
average
i
very
aggressive
some
people
would
say
pushy
but
i
do
what
i
have
to
approximately
shows
are
filmed
each
year
for
edge
of
and
tony
appears
in
most
of
them
he
starts
his
day
by
studying
lines
we
have
about
a
week
ahead
to
go
over
the
script
and
then
goes
to
the
studio
on
east
street
where
each
scene
gets
just
one
before
the
final
taping
a
quick
learner
tony
finds
that
i
have
plenty
of
time
to
do
what
i
want
last
year
he
launched
a
successful
musical
nightclub
act
and
performed
in
two
stage
plays
by
neil
simon
in
the
with
maureen
and
star
spangled
another
important
aspect
of
tony
life
is
sports
when
growing
up
in
pittsburgh
he
says
all
i
ever
wanted
was
to
be
an
athlete
my
whole
life
was
baseball
but
i
just
was
good
enough
now
he
works
out
three
times
a
week
at
the
century
health
club
on
east
street
jogs
plays
tennis
and
racquetball
and
is
on
the
softball
and
basketball
teams
of
both
edge
of
and
the
eyewitness
says
tony
the
team
plays
all
over
the
area
and
gives
the
proceeds
to
charity
unlike
his
tv
character
who
recently
brought
up
the
ratings
by
marrying
the
beautiful
april
cavanaugh
played
by
terry
davis
tony
lives
alone
in
an
upper
east
side
apartment
how
can
i
put
this
without
sounding
full
of
beans
and
he
remarks
i
find
that
life
is
a
lot
more
exciting
when
you
share
it
with
somebody
the
girl
i
dating
now
is
a
news
reporter
in
baltimore
jeanne
downey
long
distance
is
the
next
best
thing
to
being
there
believe
me
when
tony
won
the
part
of
draper
scott
over
other
actors
he
was
working
as
a
bartender
at
joe
allen
in
the
theatre
district
i
was
doing
commercials
and
a
lot
of
modeling
nothing
significant
before
this
show
i
never
made
more
than
a
year
from
acting
i
did
expect
to
get
the
part
because
they
wanted
someone
in
his
mid
they
rewrote
the
script
for
a
younger
attorney
my
agent
signed
me
up
on
a
lark
that
just
goes
to
show
when
it
happens
it
happens
tony
hates
to
cook
which
is
fine
with
the
restaurateurs
in
his
area
his
favorite
dining
spot
is
la
bonne
soupe
they
have
the
prettiest
waitresses
and
most
pleasant
food
asked
about
the
lasting
value
of
soap
opera
he
quickly
replies
i
believe
television
has
an
obligation
to
do
nothing
but
entertain
everything
on
television
even
news
is
show
business
if
it
were
they
would
have
ratings
and
handsome
newsmen
anyone
wishing
to
hear
from
tony
should
write
to
him
at
abc
avenue
of
the
americas
new
york
ny
eastsider
rodney
dangerfield
the
comedian
and
the
man
he
was
years
old
when
the
big
break
came
jack
roy
a
paint
salesman
from
queens
who
did
comedy
in
his
spare
time
stood
before
the
cameras
of
the
sullivan
and
delivered
a
routine
that
soon
had
the
audience
helpless
with
laughter
whether
they
realized
they
were
witnessing
the
birth
of
one
of
comedy
brightest
stars
is
uncertain
but
for
jack
roy
better
known
as
rodney
dangerfield
the
long
wait
was
over
his
unique
brand
of
humor
caught
on
immediately
within
a
year
he
was
able
to
quit
the
paint
business
it
was
a
colorless
job
and
give
his
full
time
to
comedy
after
appearances
with
sullivan
he
went
on
tonight
and
established
such
a
smooth
rapport
with
johnny
carson
that
he
has
so
far
been
invited
back
about
times
with
carson
acting
as
straight
man
dangerfield
tosses
off
a
string
of
outrageous
anecdotes
that
are
in
keeping
with
his
image
as
a
man
who
seems
to
have
the
whole
world
against
him
the
afternoon
i
meet
rodney
dangerfield
at
his
spacious
modern
east
side
apartment
is
like
a
day
straight
out
of
his
monologue
coming
to
the
door
dressed
in
a
polka
dot
robe
and
looking
quite
exhausted
he
apologizes
by
saying
that
he
has
been
up
since
in
the
morning
early
for
someone
who
is
accustomed
to
working
past
as
we
sit
down
to
talk
he
answers
most
of
my
questions
with
an
unexpected
seriousness
still
the
humor
creeps
in
around
the
edges
i
have
an
image
to
feed
most
comedians
do
he
says
with
a
yawn
sprawled
out
on
the
sofa
like
a
bear
prematurely
woken
from
hibernation
if
i
see
something
or
read
something
that
starts
me
thinking
i
try
to
turn
it
around
and
ask
myself
how
can
it
go
wrong
for
me
now
what
can
happen
here
for
example
you
watching
something
on
television
you
see
lindbergh
on
the
screen
your
mind
is
on
that
tv
you
get
no
respect
at
all
you
see
the
paper
flying
all
over
the
place
you
say
i
get
no
respect
at
all
i
got
arrested
for
littering
at
a
ticker
tape
parade
rickles
has
an
image
steve
martin
has
an
image
but
most
do
a
lot
of
comedians
buy
their
material
others
take
someone
else
material
and
steal
it
we
do
go
into
that
though
being
a
professional
funny
man
says
rodney
is
a
completely
total
sacrifice
it
like
dope
you
have
to
do
it
the
curse
is
to
be
a
perfectionist
he
writes
at
least
percent
of
his
act
whenever
an
original
joke
flashes
into
his
mind
he
drops
whatever
he
doing
and
jots
it
down
i
get
no
respect
on
my
wedding
night
i
got
arrested
for
having
a
girl
in
my
room
before
a
new
gag
can
be
thought
worthy
of
tonight
it
must
be
tested
and
retested
before
a
live
audience
this
is
no
problem
for
rodney
is
constantly
in
demand
all
over
the
north
american
continent
not
only
as
a
nightclub
performer
but
also
as
a
lecturer
at
colleges
last
june
he
was
invited
to
give
the
commencement
address
at
harvard
it
a
strange
thing
he
remarks
kids
are
into
me
one
probable
reason
for
his
appeal
with
the
young
is
that
rodney
has
two
children
of
his
own
an
son
in
college
and
a
daughter
who
lives
at
home
it
was
mainly
to
lighten
his
travel
schedule
and
enable
him
to
spend
more
time
with
his
children
that
rodney
opened
his
own
nightclub
nine
years
ago
known
simply
as
dangerfield
it
is
located
on
first
avenue
between
and
streets
dangerfield
is
especially
popular
with
visitors
among
the
celebrities
who
have
been
spotted
there
bob
hope
johnny
carson
joe
namath
telly
savalas
and
led
zeppelin
the
entertainment
usually
consists
of
both
music
and
comedy
jackie
mason
singers
gene
barry
and
carmen
macrae
and
america
foremost
political
impressionist
david
frye
but
the
biggest
attraction
of
course
is
rodney
himself
he
will
be
playing
the
club
from
january
until
february
seven
nights
a
week
there
is
an
cover
charge
and
a
minimum
on
food
drink
rodney
has
lived
on
the
east
side
since
born
as
jacob
cohen
years
ago
in
babylon
long
island
he
spent
most
of
his
boyhood
and
his
early
career
in
queens
after
graduating
from
richmond
hill
high
school
he
changed
his
legal
name
to
jack
roy
because
my
father
used
in
vaudeville
for
years
he
worked
small
nightclubs
for
little
or
no
pay
then
at
he
married
my
wife
was
a
singer
so
we
decided
to
both
quit
show
business
and
lead
a
normal
life
that
does
always
work
out
the
first
no
respect
joke
he
ever
wrote
says
rodney
was
i
played
hide
and
seek
they
would
even
look
for
me
the
same
basic
gag
has
since
reappeared
in
a
thousand
variations
my
twin
brother
forgot
my
birthday
rodney
now
earns
a
substantial
part
of
his
income
by
making
commercials
the
best
known
of
which
are
for
mobil
and
miller
lite
beer
he
has
cut
two
comedy
albums
and
written
a
pair
of
books
do
get
no
and
could
stand
my
wife
cooking
so
i
opened
a
for
the
moment
rodney
has
no
plans
for
other
books
or
albums
perhaps
i
not
ambitious
enough
to
pursue
different
things
the
way
i
should
he
confesses
i
rather
spend
my
free
time
at
the
health
club
the
idea
in
life
is
not
to
see
how
much
money
you
can
die
with
copyright
the
associated
pr
ess
westsider
jan
de
ruth
partner
of
nudes
and
covers
in
when
jan
de
ruth
painting
reached
the
point
where
he
could
support
himself
entirely
by
his
brush
and
palette
he
used
to
take
singing
lessons
at
in
the
morning
to
make
himself
get
up
early
today
he
gets
up
strictly
to
paint
and
does
so
with
such
skill
and
efficiency
that
he
maintains
a
reputation
as
one
of
america
foremost
painters
of
nudes
while
still
managing
to
turn
out
five
or
six
commissioned
portraits
a
month
at
and
in
the
zenith
of
his
career
de
ruth
is
a
mellow
dignified
westsider
whose
lively
eyes
reflect
the
deep
intellect
within
his
achievements
in
the
past
two
decades
are
enormous
his
works
have
graced
nearly
shows
his
portraits
of
former
first
lady
pat
nixon
and
other
celebrity
wives
have
appeared
on
the
cover
of
magazine
he
has
written
two
widely
popular
books
and
the
as
we
relax
in
the
workroom
of
his
west
street
apartment
i
begin
by
asking
how
he
came
to
specialize
in
nudes
i
always
knew
i
would
paint
women
he
says
in
a
soft
voice
shaded
with
tones
of
his
native
czechoslovakia
in
when
i
came
to
the
united
states
i
started
to
paint
nudes
is
his
choice
of
subject
matter
motivated
by
something
other
than
sake
the
only
person
i
think
who
may
have
these
thoughts
in
mind
is
myself
he
answers
smiling
frankly
because
i
always
ask
myself
whether
these
reasons
are
purely
artistic
or
do
they
come
from
the
gut
i
do
think
there
can
be
art
unless
it
comes
from
the
gut
de
ruth
painting
used
to
occupy
him
eight
to
hours
a
day
now
he
is
down
to
about
seven
hours
he
works
very
rapidly
with
intense
concentration
i
do
paint
after
the
afternoon
he
explains
except
sometimes
sketching
at
night
you
exhaust
your
juices
by
the
time
evening
comes
along
one
person
he
used
to
sketch
after
hours
was
actress
karen
black
who
lived
in
west
street
just
across
from
his
apartment
says
de
ruth
she
would
sit
in
the
in
the
windowsill
in
her
bra
and
slip
then
one
day
i
called
over
to
her
you
like
to
get
paid
for
this
she
rushed
inside
to
get
her
glasses
and
looked
over
at
me
very
surprised
she
became
my
model
for
some
time
for
a
woman
to
be
an
ideal
nude
model
said
de
ruth
she
should
be
gentle
as
intelligent
as
possible
considerate
and
somebody
in
the
arts
or
with
the
sensitivity
of
an
artist
and
she
must
be
physically
attractive
how
do
the
women
who
pose
fully
dressed
for
commissioned
portraits
compare
to
the
professional
nude
models
they
work
better
than
my
models
usually
says
the
artist
who
has
painted
ethel
kennedy
eleanor
mcgovern
and
the
late
martha
mitchell
for
they
much
more
concerned
to
participate
i
do
think
it
necessarily
something
to
do
with
vanity
it
much
more
curiosity
because
we
never
really
know
until
the
day
we
die
what
we
look
like
because
we
vary
so
much
from
one
time
to
another
ironically
martha
mitchell
wife
of
president
nixon
infamous
attorney
general
john
mitchell
posed
for
de
ruth
inside
the
watergate
building
during
the
height
of
her
fame
she
had
a
certain
peasant
charm
a
charm
of
her
own
he
recalls
a
man
who
craves
variety
de
ruth
has
for
many
years
spent
his
summers
at
a
studio
in
massachusetts
this
past
summer
he
began
to
teach
painting
in
new
mexico
something
he
has
wanted
to
try
for
a
long
time
a
passionate
skier
he
travels
to
austria
each
winter
to
pursue
the
sport
that
he
learned
as
a
child
then
gave
up
until
his
his
other
activities
i
love
to
be
in
the
company
of
women
says
the
artist
with
a
radiant
smile
adding
that
he
prefers
their
company
when
he
not
painting
them
the
east
side
according
to
the
artist
is
a
city
in
itself
there
a
sterility
over
there
at
least
for
me
i
just
ca
see
myself
without
this
mixture
that
the
west
side
is
de

has
been
going
to
the
same
chinese
laundry
for
years

avenue
another
business
he
has
patronized
all
that
time
is
schneider
art
supplies
at
street
and
columbus
as
the
interview
comes
to
a
close
i
ask
de
ruth
what
advice
he
would
give
to
an
aspiring
young
artist
never
be
discouraged
by
anyone
or
anything
he
says
then
to
balance
his
remarks
he
relates
an
anecdote
about
an
art
student
who
asked
degas
what
he
could
do
to
help
the
world
of
art
replied
degas

she
explains
i

she
continues
her

jingling
as
she
settles
onto
the
sofa
tall
and
attractive
with
large
expressive

miss

well
as
her

miss

already

contracts
for
performances
into
although
a

noted
operas
such
as

and
a

we
may
not
have
the
main
roles

we

in
her
rich
southern
accent
shouting
the
last
word
as
if
from
an
overflow
of

not

of
the
roles
i
get
today
are

miss

has
never
had
any
children
of
her
own
somewhat
to
her
regret
but
she
and
her
husband
frequently
have
their
nephews
and
nieces
staying
for
extended
periods
our
niece
evi
from
austria
is
living
with

now
she
like
a
little
daughter
and
i
adore
her
she

she

a
very
gregarious

who
enjoy
throwing
huge

parties
mignon
cooking
like
her
singing
is
international
i
cook
austrian
i
cook
new
orleans
i
cook
some
nice
italian
and
french
things
i
going
to
be
in
paris
later
this
year
for
six
weeks
and
i
really
seriously
want
to
go
to
the
cordon
bleu
cooking
school
and
take
at
least
a
course
around
the
late
she
was
based
in
germany
for
several
years
there
says
dunn
many
new
operas
are
premiered
each
year
while
in
the
they
are
a
rarity
it
all
comes
back
to
the
fact
that
we
do
have
government
subsidy
we
have
to
worry
about
selling
tickets
opera
is
an
expensive
thing
and
until
we
get
this
government
support
which
people
for
some
reason
are
afraid
of
we
can
not
be
as
experimental
as
we
would
like
to
be
brought
up
on
a
cotton
plantation
in
memphis
she
entered
her
first
singing
contest
at
the
age
of
and
spent
most
saturday
afternoons
in
her
girlhood
listening
with
rapt
attention
to
the
metropolitan
opera
broadcast
on
the
radio
immediately
following
her
high
school
graduation
she
was
auditioned
by
met
scouts
and
encouraged
to
go
to
new
york
there
after
several
years
of
study
she
won
a
national
competition
that
launched
her
career
dunn
spent
part
of
three
seasons
with
the
new
york
city
opera
before
joining
the
met
it
was
many
years
however
before
her
talents
were
fully
appreciated
there
it
only
took
me
auditions
to
get
into
the
new
york
city
opera
and
at
least
that
many
at
the
met
so
take
heart
everybody
she
says
laughing
merrily
she
has
made
numerous
opera
recordings
including
the
role
of
susan
anthony
in
virgil
thompson
mother
of
us
and
maddalena
in
i
do
ever
listen
to
my
recordings
she
says
when
asked
to
name
her
favorite
i
listen
to
the
playbacks
when
i
can
do
something
about
it
but
i
do
listen
to
recordings
afterwards
because
there
nothing
that
i
can
do
about
it
and
i
know
i
going
to
find
a
million
things
that
i
do
like
mignon
and
her
husband
recently
bought
a
house
in
connecticut
but
they
will
keep
their
westside
apartment
we
have
three
acres
she
says
proudly
i
hope
we
get
a
couple
of
horses
and
i
would
love
a
goat
i
love
goats
they
so
cute
i
love
animals
we
have
a
great
dane
and
a
labrador
and
i
very
much
into
the
business
with
the
animal
protection
institute
most
of
the
experiments
that
are
done
with
animals
today
there
just
no
reason
for
it
i
mean
i
do
think
we
need
another
shampoo
on
the
market
really
her
voice
rises
with
feeling
as
she
pursues
the
subject
it
is
really
the
slavery
of
today
people
do
have
any
feelings
for
animals
and
i
just
rabid
i
really
am
it
is
so
anytime
anybody
wants
me
to
do
a
benefit
for
animals
just
call
me
and
i
do
it
any
day
i
got
free
i
would
like
to
do
more
benefits
actually
i
hardly
ever
asked
to
but
if
i
were
asked
i
would
do
it
eastsider
douglas
fairbanks
a
man
for
all
seasons
six
times
he
has
received
an
advance
to
write
his
autobiography
and
six
times
he
has
returned
the
money
because
of
the
enormity
of
the
task
the
life
of
douglas
fairbanks
is
too
rich
and
varied
to
be
condensed
into
a
narrative
the
only
child
of
douglas
fairbanks
america
first
great
matinee
idol
he
has
acted
in
more
than
feature
films
produced
television
plays
and
a
dozen
movies
performed
in
countless
stage
plays
and
musicals
made
numerous
recordings
written
screenplays
published
his
articles
and
drawings
in
many
of
the
nation
leading
magazines
and
given
his
time
freely
to
at
least
public
service
organizations
ten
countries
on
four
continents
have
presented
him
with
major
awards
for
his
diplomatic
and
philanthropic
activities
one
morning
i
woke
up
and
said
suppose
i
must
have
retired
notes
the
tanned
vigorous
at
his
madison
avenue
office
from
behind
his
huge
antique
desk
with
brass
lions
heads
for
drawer
pulls
but
in
our
long
discussion
it
becomes
obvious
that
he
has
never
actually
retired
either
as
an
entertainer
or
as
a
force
in
public
affairs
his
office
is
fairly
cluttered
with
mementoes
of
his
world
travels
swords
statuettes
novelty
lamps
old
photographs
oversized
travel
books
the
actor
sits
looking
very
comfortable
as
he
tells
about
his
ongoing
stage
career
my
favorite
type
of
work
right
now
is
doing
plays
for
limited
periods
in
i
gave
up
stage
acting
but
in
i
did
the
first
big
revival
of
fair
and
since
then
i
have
been
in
several
other
plays
this
summer
i
doing
fair
again
in
reno
for
eight
to
weeks
i
did
want
to
copy
rex
harrison
but
i
was
prevailed
upon
by
lerner
and
loewe
to
do
this
i
known
them
since
before
they
knew
each
other
they
going
to
make
a
number
of
adjustments
for
me
my
other
project
which
is
still
in
the
planning
stages
is
a
new
broadway
show
but
it
really
too
soon
to
talk
about
it
on
august
the
classic
film
in
which
fairbanks
co
stars
with
cary
grant
will
be
shown
at
on
channel
with
a
single
his
other
hit
films
include
the
and
prisoner
of
he
acted
in
his
first
movie
in
while
barely
in
his
teens
and
in
he
was
designated
a
star
he
continued
to
make
films
until
when
he
joined
the
armed
forces
and
served
for
more
than
five
years
then
he
resumed
his
film
career
with
much
success
before
turning
his
hand
to
producing
in
everybody
misuses
the
word
today
he
explains
legally
it
only
means
having
your
name
above
the
title
there
no
such
thing
as
a
superstar
that
a
term
we
have
let
creep
into
the
language
actually
charlie
chaplin
may
have
been
a
superstar
but
he
one
of
the
very
few
he
laughs
and
tells
about
another
aspect
of
moviemaking
that
amuses
him
very
few
of
the
great
producers
in
the
past
paid
any
attention
to
credits
at
all
now
they
all
like
to
get
their
names
in
the
billing
and
in
the
ads
as
big
as
the
stars
names
as
if
anybody
cares
who
made
the
film
asked
whether
his
career
was
helped
by
having
a
famous
father
in
the
movie
business
he
replies
that
the
advantages
were
ephemeral
they
were
limited
to
people
being
polite
and
nice
but
that
would
necessarily
lead
to
any
jobs
it
usually
meant
that
i
would
be
underpaid
rather
than
overpaid
and
they
would
expect
more
of
me
by
the
time
i
became
a
star
my
father
had
already
retired
his
stepmother
mary
pickford
america
sweetheart
who
died
in
may
at
the
age
of
joined
with
douglas
fairbanks
charlie
chaplin
and
griffith
in
to
found
united
artists
the
following
year
she
married
fairbanks
and
together
they
virtually
ruled
hollywood
douglas
junior
who
became
close
to
his
father
only
in
his
late
teens
grew
up
in
new
york
hollywood
london
and
paris
which
helps
to
explain
his
love
for
travel
and
his
endless
quest
for
variety
as
the
creative
force
behind
the
acclaimed
tv
series
fairbanks
he
produced
an
average
of
films
a
year
from
and
my
studio
manager
had
a
heart
attack
and
my
story
editor
had
a
nervous
breakdown
just
from
the
pressure
of
getting
out
these
films
i
thought
i
would
be
next
so
i
decided
to
quit
he
says
they
were
very
elaborate
productions
we
used
to
have
the
scripts
six
months
in
advance
now
if
you
start
shooting
on
tuesday
you
get
the
script
on
monday
today
with
his
multiple
business
interests
and
philanthropic
pursuits
he
maintains
a
house
in
florida
an
office
in
london
and
since
an
apartment
on
the
upper
east
side
he
and
his
wife
mary
have
been
married
for
years
and
have
three
daughters
two
of
whom
live
in
england
his
overall
career
concludes
fairbanks
does
not
have
a
single
theme
because
it
been
so
diversified
it
been
a
series
of
themes
maybe
cacophonous
the
things
i
find
most
interesting
do
pay
a
penny
but
possibly
all
my
activities
blended
together
have
something
to
do
with
a
person
who
got
a
lot
of
curiosity
and
energy
and
capacity
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
life
westsider
lee
falk
creator
of
the
phantom
and
mandrake
the
magician
who
is
the
most
widely
read
author
in
the
world
today
not
counting
chairman
mao
whose
quotations
are
required
reading
for
of
the
earth
population
the
honor
probably
belongs
to
a
dapper
man
in
his
early
who
could
walk
from
his
westside
apartment
all
the
way
to
times
square
without
being
recognized
he
is
not
a
familiar
figure
on
book
jackets
or
talk
shows
because
lee
falk
happens
to
be
a
comic
strip
writer
his
two
creations
the
phantom
and
mandrake
the
magician
are
published
in
more
than
newspapers
in
countries
his
daily
readership
close
to
million
one
of
the
few
places
in
the
world
where
my
strips
do
run
is
in
new
york
city
says
falk
leaning
gently
forward
in
his
chair
they
ran
in
the
york
journal
for
years
that
was
the
biggest
afternoon
paper
in
america
until
the
newspaper
strike
about
years
ago
then
it
folded
as
did
most
of
new
york
papers
we
were
left
with
the
the
and
the
but
my
strips
do
run
in
the
newspaper
and
in
the
york
news
he
arrived
in
new
york
from
missouri
during
the
great
depression
while
still
in
his
teens
carrying
a
sample
strip
he
had
written
and
drawn
king
features
bought
mandrake
the
magician
and
two
years
later
added
the
phantom
to
their
syndicate
in
the
beginning
falk
did
both
the
drawing
and
the
writing
himself
then
for
a
long
time
i
used
to
make
rough
sketches
and
give
them
to
my
artists
he
recalls
now
i
just
give
a
description
of
each
panel
i
might
say
or
shot
like
you
do
in
a
film
then
i
put
in
the
dialogue
some
of
my
early
artists
are
dead
they
gone
on
to
their
reward
to
that
big
bar
up
in
the
sky
where
all
artists
go
now
there
one
group
drawing
my
strips
on
long
island
and
another
one
on
cape
cod
very
often
i
do
see
them
from
one
year
to
the
next
collaboration
works
best
that
way
since
giving
up
his
drawing
pad
falk
has
increased
his
literary
output
many
times
over
besides
doing
all
the
writing
for
his
strips
for
the
past
years
which
now
takes
up
but
a
small
part
of
his
time
he
has
written
five
novels
and
a
dozen
plays
he
owns
five
theatres
he
has
directed
about
plays
and
produced
none
of
his
own
dramatic
works
has
been
a
big
commercial
success
although
one
is
currently
doing
well
in
paris
then
there
was
the
comedy
that
he
with
a
young
american
he
met
in
rome
just
before
world
war
ii
it
almost
made
it
to
broadway
says
falk
it
was
redone
about
two
years
ago
on
the
west
coast
my
collaborator
was
there
to
see
it
too
we
remained
friends
to
this
day
you
may
have
heard
of
the
man
he
a
senator
from
california
the
senate
majority
whip
his
name
is
alan
cranston
you
see
it
best
to
save
the
punch
line
for
the
end
another
of
falk
main
pastimes
is
travel
he
has
visited
enough
islands
jungles
and
places
to
keep
the
story
ideas
flowing
for
years
to
come
but
his
appetite
is
still
unwhetted
early
this
year
he
toured
scandinavia
when
they
were
making
a
big
fuss
about
the
marriage
there
were
so
many
press
conferences
to
attend
one
guy
made
me
wear
a
mask
and
the
next
day
as
i
got
on
the
plane
there
was
my
picture
on
the
front
page
i
said
your
paper
does
even
run
the
phantom
he
said
phantom
belongs
to
all
of
norway
in
april
of
this
year
lee
and
his
wife
elizabeth
a
cosmetics
executive
turned
mystery
writer
spent
three
weeks
in
the
people
republic
of
china
ironically
although
that
is
one
of
the
few
places
in
the
world
where
falk
name
is
completely
unknown
neither
he
nor
anyone
else
in
his
touring
group
could
escape
the
public
eye
they
were
fascinated
by
seeing
us
because
for
a
whole
generation
the
chinese
have
been
shut
off
from
foreign
visitors
they
crowded
around
us
deep
and
held
up
their
babies
an
man
who
loves
to
play
tennis
ride
his
bicycle
and
go
swimming
falk
has
lived
on
the
west
side
for
over
years
because
i
find
the
east
side
a
little
too
chichi
for
my
tastes
another
westside
characteristic
he
likes
is
the
abundance
of
puerto
rican
residents
they
very
sweet
gentle
people
deputy
mayor
herman
badillo
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
he
knew
my
comic
strips
from
puerto
rico
lee
falk
estimates
that
over
a
period
of
years
i
must
have
written
about
to
stories
they
would
fill
this
whole
room
where
does
he
get
his
inspiration
a
lot
of
it
comes
from
my
travels
it
all
grist
for
the
mill
now
and
then
i
see
something
in
the
news
and
adapt
it
to
my
features
for
example
once
i
saw
a
story
in
magazine
about
a
swiss
scientist
who
was
experimenting
with
he
managed
to
breed
some
european
cattle
back
to
the
original
aurochs
which
has
been
extinct
for
several
hundred
years
i
put
his
idea
into
mandrake
a
scientist
started
with
a
lizard
and
ended
up
with
a
dinosaur
the
veteran
storyteller
never
gets
tired
of
spinning
his
yarns
i
enjoy
it
it
something
i
can
do
both
the
phantom
and
mandrake
are
translated
into
about
languages
after
all
these
years
they
bigger
than
ever
except
in
this
country

we
lost
so
many
papers

barry
farber
radio
talkmaster
and
linguist
dull
is
a
word
that
could
never
be
used
to
describe
barry
farber
he
is
a
totally
unique
individual
with
so
many
ideas
that
his
conservative
label
seems
to
fit
him
poorly
even
though
it
was
as
a
conservative
that
he
ran
for
mayor
of
new
york
last
year
and
garnered
almost
as
many
votes
as
his
republican
opponent
roy
goodman
during
that
campaign
barry
quit
the
syndicated
talk
show
on
wor
radio
that
he
had
hosted
for
years
in
march
of
this
year
his
mesmerizing
southern
drawl
took
over
the
to
monday
to
friday
time
slot
on
wmca
am
the
ratings
have
gone
up
at
least
since
he
joined
the
station
i
meet
barry
for
an
interview
one
august
afternoon
at
a
chinese
restaurant
near
the
studio
to
my
amazement
he
orders
the
meal
entirely
in
cantonese
then
he
withdraws
a
stack
of
index
cards
from
his
pocket
on
which
are
printed
vocabulary
words
in
finnish
italian
and
mandarin
chinese
a
few
of
the
languages
that
he
studies
during
spare
moments
in
his
hectic
work
week
the
lank
neatly
garbed
in
a
suit
is
surprisingly
in
our
conversation
yet
the
verbal
gems
still
trip
as
neatly
off
his
tongue
as
they
do
when
he
putting
an
irate
telephone
caller
in
his
place
to
the
delight
of
radio
listeners
never
hesitant
to
voice
his
opinion
on
any
topic
barry
pounces
on
my
questions
with
an
eagerness
that
belies
his
calm
exterior
new
york
reputation
outside
the
city
limits
says
the
widely
travelled
farber
has
gone
way
downhill
in
recent
decades
it
used
to
be
where
i
grew
up
that
people
would
brag
about
coming
to
new
york
four
times
a
year
today
they
brag
about
never
coming
here
the
large
companies
send
their
salesmen
to
manhattan
for
a
conference
like
an
entebbe
raid
new
york
needs
not
a
slow
gradual
comeback
it
needs
a
dramatic
voice
who
is
going
to
say
that
the
city
priorities
for
the
last
years
have
been
wrong
new
york
is
a
sexy
woman
been
running
around
in
the
mud
turn
the
hose
on
her
and
she
going
to
regain
her
allure
the
tax
revolt
he
believes
should
definitely
come
to
new
york
you
can
not
expect
to
live
as
sinfully
economically
as
we
lived
and
avoid
a
rampage
the
politicians
have
brought
this
upon
themselves
and
let
them
get
away
with
telling
us
that
they
have
to
cut
police
firemen
and
sanitation
before
they
cut
themselves
because
they
do
when
john
lindsay
was
mayor
he
flung
back
his
head
and
inhaled
the
vapors
of
the
and
it
was
left
baby
left
he
bet
his
presidential
hopes
on
that
but
in
the
last
mayoral
election
it
was
the
conservatives
who
did
the
best
koch
was
the
most
conservative
democrat
running
his
anticommunist
sentiments
come
to
the
surface
when
the
subject
turns
to
the
olympics
i
think
we
should
have
never
allowed
it
in
moscow
on
the
grounds
that
we
have
never
had
the
olympics
in
a
dictatorship
in
the
modern
era
i
like
to
see
the
athletes
of
the
world
say
not
going
to
moscow
to
play
sportive
games
by
rules
when
the
russians
live
in
violation
of
the
rules
of
civilization
itself
russia
is
guilty
of
the
world
worst
cast
of
unsportsmanlike
conduct
yes
we
should
pull
out
but
the
olympics
is
small
potatoes
i
say
start
a
new
united
nations
for
the
free
countries
of
the
world
a
ufn
a
united
free
nations
which
shall
be
an
association
of
all
nations
governed
by
law
of
all
free
democracies
that
want
to
remain
free
in
we
did
not
seek
to
build
a
fraternity
of
dictatorships
where
tinhorn

would
outvote

barry
has
lived
on
the
west
side
ever
since
he
came
to
the
city
from
greensboro
north
carolina
years
ago
and
now
occupies
a
penthouse
overlooking
the
hudson
river
the
west
side
and
the
east
side
are
like
east
berlin
and
west
berlin
in
terms
of
the
rigidity
of
lifestyle
he
says
there
a
feeling
on
the
west
side
that
we
do
have
to
impress
each
other
we
know
where
it
at
recently
divorced
from
his
swedish
wife
barry
makes
frequent
overnight
trips
to
sweden
to
see
his
children
he
has
to
be
back
at
the
wmca
studio
on
sunday
at
for
his
live
show
with
guests
two
weeks
ago
he
asked
robert
violante
who
was
shot
and
partially
blinded
by
son
of
sam
what
it
felt
like
to
be
shot
in
the
head
questions
like
this
tend
to
provoke
as
many
listeners
as
they
fascinate
and
that
is
why
barry
prefers
not
to
be
too
specific
about
his
address
i
do
do
a
merry
mailman
kind
of
show
he
says
with
a
one
of
my
fantasies
is
to
have
a
hit
man
from
the
communist
party
the
nazi
party
the
plo
and
the
black
panthers
approach
me
from
four
different
directions
and
fire
all
at
once

i
duck
westsider
suzanne
farrell
star
of
the
new
york
city
ballet
she
arrived
in
new
york
like
a
fairy
princess
a
wondrous
creation
whose
beauty
and
talent
left
audiences
gaping
in
astonishment
at
she
became
the
youngest
person
ever
to
join
george
balanchine
new
york
city
ballet
and
at
she
was
promoted
to
the
rank
of
principal
dancer
since
that
time
seasons
have
come
and
gone
but
suzanne
farrell
the
girl
from
cincinnati
is
still
the
darling
of
america
foremost
ballet
company
in
a
dressing
room
interview
last
week
at
the
new
york
state
theatre
the
slender
miss
farrell
spoke
at
length
about
her
public
and
private
life
quickly
revealing
the
two
qualities
that
have
enabled
her
to
remain
one
of
the
world
top
ballerinas
for
so
long
first
is
her
boundless
energy
second
is
her
genuine
love
for
people
and
the
world
of
ballet
warm
funny
and
articulate
about
her
art
she
discussed
with
enthusiasm
the
upcoming
television
special
by
balanchine
part
which
will
be
aired
may
on
channel
this
is
one
of
four
programs
we
taped
in
nashville
she
said
in
a
voice
as
clear
and
melodic
as
an
actress
the
name
of
the
ballet
i
in
is
the
music
is
by
ravel
we
did
the
finale
before
the
beginning
because
they
wanted
to
let
go
the
four
extra
couples
that
were
needed
for
that
part
it
was
very
strange
like
having
dessert
before
the
meal
she
laughed
lightly
tossing
back
her
long
silky
brown
hair
the
tv
studio
is
very
small
and
the
camera
sees
things
differently
than
the
audience
sees
when
you
on
stage
things
that
are
done
in
a
circle
look
like
an
oval
and
diagonal
movement
has
to
be
done
in
a
straight
line
suzanne
brightest
moment
in
the
program
is
a
solo
at
the
beginning
which
she
performs
to
the
music
of
a
solo
violin
one
of
the
things
i
like
about
doing
ballet
on
television
is
that
you
can
reach
many
people
who
have
never
seen
live
dance
before
about
two
years
ago
i
got
a
beautiful
letter
from
an
older
man
in
oklahoma
who
was
certainly
not
in
the
habit
of
writing
fan
letters
now
every
time
i
tape
a
new
program
i
think
of
that
man
is
one
of
my
favorite
ballets
because
it
was
the
first
one
that
balanchine
choreographed
for
me
after
i
returned
to
the
company
in
in
suzanne
left
the
new
york
city
ballet
and
spent
the
next
four
seasons
with
maurice
bejart
ballet
of
the
century
in
brussels
belgium
when
she
finally
wrote
to
balanchine
to
find
out
the
chances
of
dancing
with
him
again
he
simply
asked
when
she
could
start
in
brussels
the
type
of
ballet
they
used
to
is
different
so
they
react
differently
if
you
were
to
give
them
a
beautiful
wonderfully
stark
ballet
with
little
costume
and
scenery
they
might
not
take
to
it
as
much
but
it
was
a
good
thing
to
have
in
my
career
i
demand
that
i
get
something
constructive
out
of
any
situation
because
life
is
so
short
that
you
afford
to
not
give
everything
every
time
you
go
out
there
for
the
past
years
she
has
been
married
to
paul
mejia
a
former
dancer
who
is
today
the
artistic
director
and
choreographer
for
the
ballet
de
guatemala
one
of
latin
america
major
companies
although
the
couple
must
undergo
some
long
separations
their
marriage
is
a
happy
one
spending
time
alone
at
her
lincoln
center
area
apartment
does
not
bother
suzanne
with
a
steady
diet
of
exercise
classes
rehearsals
and
performances
and
her
nine
pets
eight
cats
and
a
dog
suzanne
has
little
time
to
be
lonely
when
i
have
a
free
night
it
terrible
she
lamented
because
every
time
the
phone
rings
i
think
no
they
want
me
for
a
performance
i
dance
just
about
every
night
by
the
time
i
go
to
bed
it
about
i
happen
to
get
up
about
on
monday
my
free
day
i
teach
at
the
american
school
of
ballet
it
such
a
shock
to
do
two
performances
on
saturday
and
sunday
and
none
on
monday
it
hardly
worth
it
because
the
body
ca
adjust
i
have
always
thought
that
actors
have
it
easier
than
dancers
because
it
does
matter
so
much
how
tired
your
body
is
all
you
need
is
your
mouth
a
westsider
for
most
of
her
career
suzanne
lists
reading
and
cooking
as
her
preferred
pastimes
i
a
great
cook
i
think
if
i
a
dancer
i
be
a
waitress
two
local
restaurants
she
likes
to
frequent
are
rikyu
columbus
and
victor
cafe
columbus
asked
about
her
salary
suzanne
admitted
that
you
never
make
a
lot
of
money
in
ballet
it
something
we
do
because
we
love
it
and
we
have
to
do
it
to
be
happy
the
sole
attraction
is
working
for
balanchine
and
the
new
york
city
ballet
that
something
you
ca
put
down
in
dollars
and
cents
i
just
assume
that
the
company
is
paying
us
as
much
as
they
can
she
smiled
radiantly
and
added
most
dancers
would
know
what
to
do
with
a
lot
of
money
anyway
because
they
would
have
time
to
spend
it
westsider
jules
feiffer
screenwriter
for
the
imagine
a
movie
starring
dustin
hoffman
as
popeye
the
sailor
and
lily
tomlin
as
his
girlfriend
olive
oyl
anyone
who
has
seen
the
old
popeye
cartoons
or
the
new
computer
animated
ones
might
think
that
the
fighting
mariner
does
not
have
the
dramatic
qualities
needed
for
a
film
but
according
to
westsider
jules
feiffer
who
is
now
writing
the
script
for
the
the
original
comic
strip
in
the
daily
newspapers
was
the
work
of
an
unrecognized
genius
segar
created
popeye
and
drew
him
from
to
after
that
the
character
changed
feiffer
finds
the
original
strip
to
be
his
biggest
source
of
inspiration
the
cartoons
says
feiffer
sitting
on
one
arm
of
a
chair
in
his
riverside
drive
apartment
exploit
the
violence
between
popeye
and
bluto
that
was
never
part
of
the
strip
it
more
along
the
lines
of
the
traditional
cartoon
of
the
which
could
find
nothing
more
interesting
than
one
character
dismembering
another
i
did
find
that
funny
when
i
was
a
kid
and
i
do
now
feiffer
developed
his
unique
style
of
humor
long
before
he
sold
his
first
cartoon
today
though
still
perhaps
best
known
as
a
cartoonist
he
has
gained
a
reputation
as
a
playwright
for
both
the
stage
and
and
the
screen
he
is
also
a
respected
prose
writer
having
recently
published
his
second
novel
a
product
of
the
bronx
feiffer
recalls
that
after
graduating
from
high
school
he
went
through
a
series
of
schlock
jobs
to
buy
food
and
drawing
materials
and
long
periods
of
unemployment
he
planned
all
along
to
become
a
cartoonist
i
was
prepared
he
says
for
the
eventual
success
which
i
was
certain
was
going
to
happen
if
my
work
remained
true
to
myself
feiffer
spent
several
years
as
an
assistant
to
other
cartoonists
and
attended
two
art
schools
still
no
one
would
publish
his
work
until
a
day
in
when
feiffer
age
took
a
batch
of
his
best
to
the
office
of
a
new
relatively
unknown
weekly
called
village
they
loved
his
work
and
he
became
a
regular
contributor
all
other
publications
at
that
time
had
their
own
idea
of
their
readership
and
editors
insisted
on
tailoring
stories
to
their
own
taste
the
says
feiffer
existed
for
the
artist
taste
and
the
writer
taste
it
was
a
time
when
mccarthyism
and
the
blacklist
were
rampant
through
every
strata
of
society
the
was
then
the
only
publication
of
its
kind
it
wrote
about
dissent
it
was
considered
revolutionary
and
feiffer
weekly
cartoons
helped
it
to
maintain
that
image
success
came
quickly
to
feiffer
after
he
joined
the
it
happened
faster
than
i
thought
it
was
only
about
three
months
or
so
before
my
work
came
to
be
talked
about
and
publishers
began
to
offer
book
contracts
syndication
took
place
a
few
years
later
now
the
cartoon
is
carried
by
somewhat
over
publications
in
every
country
of
the
western
world
and
several
in
the
far
east
feiffer
cartoon
takes
him
one
day
a
week
to
conceive
and
draw
during
the
other
six
days
he
works
on
his
latest
writing
project
for
three
years
until
it
was
published
this
past
summer
that
project
was
an
unconventional
novel
in
which
the
characters
are
too
human
to
keep
their
traditional
roles
as
props
for
the
cleverness
the
book
is
less
suspenseful
than
a
standard
detective
novel
but
more
revealing
of
human
nature
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
in
my
work
for
many
years
says
feiffer
is
people
need
to
communicate
with
each
other
not
directly
but
in
code
coded
language
is

feiffer
main
character
takes
the
name
roger
ackroyd
and
tries
to
become
a
private
detective
instead
he
gets
so
intertwined
with
the
coded
life
of
his
clients
that
he
works
on
that
for
the
rest
of
his
career
got
extremely
mixed
reviews
it
what
i
used
to
notes
the
author
some
reviews
have
been
glowing
others
wondered
what
the
hell
the
book
was
about
and
why
i
bothered
to
write
it
feiffer
takes
the
good
and
the
bad
in
stride
remembering
what
happened
when
his
first
play
opened
on
broadway
in
it
got
all
negative
reviews
and
closed
in
a
week
he
recalls
it
was
immediately
done
in
london
after
that
which
started
the
revival
because
it
was
done
very
successfully
then
it
was
brought
back
to
new
york
the
following
year
and
it
won
all
the
awards
in
it
was
made
into
a
successful
film
starring
elliott
gould
and
marcia
rodd
an
occasional
theatregoer
feiffer
ends
the
interview
on
a
customary
depressing
note
saying
that
he
is
generally
disappointed
by
even
the
biggest
hits
in
town
i
do
think
of
myself
as
a
broadway
playwright
he
says
i
be
ashamed
of
that
title
i
do
think
the
broadway
theatre
is
very
interesting

the
last
years

geraldine
fitzgerald
actress
director
and
singer
anyone
hearing
her
rasping
throaty
voice
for
the
first
time
might
think
she
were
suffering
from
laryngitis
but
those
who
have
come
to
love
and
admire
geraldine
fitzgerald
over
the
past
years
hear
nothing
but
earthy
humanity
in
the
voice
one
of
the
most
versatile
actresses
in
america
as
unorthodox
as
she
is
gifted
miss
fitzgerald
at
remains
at
the
height
of
her
career
constantly
juggling
a
variety
of
projects
as
she
says
like
somebody
cooking
a
meal
with
many
courses
we
sitting
in
her
upper
east
side
living
room
which
is
decorated
in
white
from
floor
to
ceiling
carpet
chairs
tables
sofa
and
even
the
television
the
only
picture
is
a
childhood
portrait
of
her
daughter
susan
scheftel
now
a
graduate
student
i
like
light
unimpeded
explains
geraldine
her
rosy
face
breaking
into
its
customary
smile
and
if
everything
is
white
it
different
in
the
morning
and
it
different
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
it
different
all
the
time
a
slender
handsome
woman
with
a
penchant
for
long
flowing
skirts
and
bright
lipstick
whose
straight
gray
hair
descends
halfway
down
her
back
geraldine
is
soon
talking
about
the
play
that
she
is
directing
at
the
manhattan
theatre
club
it
will
open
in
mid
may
it
by
a
very
young
author
called
bill
davis
we
did
it
last
october
at
the
circle
rep
lab
and
it
was
very
successful
but
it
needed
strengthening
points
so
bill
has
just
completed
the
ninth
draft
milo
is
going
to
star
in
it
he
ireland
premier
comedian
and
a
magnificent
dramatic
actor
too
miss
fitzgerald
next
acting
role
will
be
in
a
play
titled
about
a
woman
who
runs
away
from
home
to
seek
her
own
internal
freedom
like
nora
in
doll
the
only
difference
is
she
my
age
so
of
course
her
options
are
few
and
she
goes
right
down
to
the
bottom
she
becomes
a
derelict
and
then
slowly
slowly
slowly
she
comes
up
to
find
some
kind
of
strength
and
independence
it
a
drama
but
a
very
comedic
drama
her
third
major
project
at
the
moment
is
to
prepare
her
acclaimed
one
woman
show
for
a
small
broadway
house
such
as
the
rialto
she
started
to
take
singing
lessons
about
years
ago
and
introduced
her
nightclub
act
in
employing
her
remarkable
acting
technique
to
make
the
songs
personal
and
moving
she
has
performed
the
act
at
reno
sweeney
at
lincoln
center
in
a
special
for
public
television
and
at
the
white
house
for
president
and
carter
i
do
sing
what
called
songs
people
think
i
do
i
sing
songs
that
are
very
winning
because
the
songs
that
people
sing
when
on
their
own
whether
singing
in
the
streets
singing
in
the
shower
singing
in
the
car
they
do
not
sing
losing
songs
we
did
know
that
for
a
long
time
is
richard
maltby
who
did
he
my
colleague
and
partner
and
he
directed
it
at
first
we
could
understand
why
a
marvelous
song
like
lomond
was
sort
of
rejected
by
the
audience
and
then
a
song
like
boy
that
you
think
everybody
sick
of
was
acceptable
well
boy
believe
it
or
not
is
a
winning
song
at
the
end
of
it
the
girl
says
if
i
dead
if
you
come
back
and
you
whisper
that
you
love
me
still
i
hear
you
in
my
grave
and
then
i
know
that
be
beside
me
for
eternity
whereas
lomond
starts
off
so
well
but
each
verse
says
me
and
my
true
love
will
never
meet
again

where
she
made

classic

as

for
which
she
received
an
oscar

in
she
settled
on

has
been

there
ever
since

favorite

when
it
was
revived
off

in

biggest

miss

is
the
first
actress
ever
to
receive
the
handel
medallion
new
york
highest
cultural
award
if
geraldine
has
one
regret
about
her
career
it
is
that
it
took
her
so
many
decades
to
get
up
the
courage
to
sing
everybody
told
me
not
to
because
i
have
such
a
funny
voice
then
i
realized
that
i
needed
a
vehicle
for
expressing
what
i
feel
about
the
world
and
about
people
that
was
very
flexible
and
was
mine
and
if
the
audience
would
put
up
with
the
harsh
sounds
then
i
could
use
it
and
evidently
they
can
so
if
they
can
now
i
guess
they
always

her
slender

resting

in

the

than

as
the
title
implies
miss
fontaine
life
has
been
one
long
roller
coaster
ride
of
triumph
and
tragedy
during
the
she
received
three
oscar
nominations
for
best
actress
in
the
space
of
four
years
and
won
the
award
for
she
had
the
joy
of
raising
two
children
one
of
them
adopted
but
the
disappointment
of
four
divorces
her
mother
who
died
in
was
the
best
friend
she
has
ever
known
yet
both
her
father
and
her
stepfather
gave
her
nothing
but
unhappiness
and
she
never
had
a
close
relationship
with
her
famous
older
sister
olivia
de
havilland
in
fact
the
pair
have
not
spoken
in
years
for
reasons
clearly
explained
in
fontaine
book
a
fiercely
independent
woman
who
has
flown
her
own
airplane
and
taken
part
in
international
ballooning
competition
she
has
suffered
through
numerous
illnesses
and
injuries
that
brought
her
close
to
permanent
disability
or
death
these
are
the
elements
of
bed
of
a
disarmingly
frank
memoir
that
is
frequently
unsettling
but
never
boring
the
fan
mail
for
this
book
is
getting
to
be
enormous
says
fontaine
still
radiant
at
a
lot
of
people
identify
with
the
illnesses
or
with
trying
to
bring
up
children
alone
some
people
empathize
because
they
had
harsh
relations
with
their
siblings
a
lot
of
men
have
told
me
they
cried
at
the
end
in
my
epitaph
to
my
mother
and
then
of
course
i
have
heard
from
a
lot
of
people
who
wanted
to
be
actresses
or
actors
did
she
write
the
entire
book
herself
every
single
word
i
would
let
them
touch
one
of
them
it
not
a
sordid
book
it
not
tacky
one
reviewer
said
it
was
immoral
i
do
think
i
can
figure
that
out
if
you
ask
me
it
rather
religious
the
words
come
out
like
perfect
silver
beads
she
has
always
been
a
formidable
presence
on
the
screen
and
is
no
less
so
in
person
as
she
gives
her
unrestrained
opinions
on
every
topic
introduced
marriage
says
fontaine
is
waiting
on
or
waiting
for
somebody
asked
whether
she
believes
two
average
people
can
remain
happily
married
for
a
lifetime
she
replies
it
depends
how
hypocritical
they
are
and
how
much
lying
they
want
to
do
i
think
the
word
means
an
entirely
different
thing
to
a
woman
than
it
does
to
a
man
her
classic
movies
including
jane
eyre
and
above
are
frequently
seen
on
television
now
but
fontaine
has
little
respect
for
television
as
a
medium
i
consider
it
nothing
more
than
b
pictures
i
think
we
took
a
little
more
care
with
b
pictures
the
actors
and
actresses
got
a
chance
in
a
television
film
if
the
actor
slips
on
a
word
to
hell
with
it
we
cut
around
it
earlier
this
year
fontaine
appeared
in
the
movie
starring
jaclyn
smith
she
could
do
many
others
but
prefers
to
be
choosy
the
quality
of
the
scripts
is
so
poor
i
think
it
the
taste
of
the
times
it
a
brutal
world
it
a
vulgar
world
it
quite
different
from
the
romance
of
jane
eyre
i
do
think
i
could
act
those
roles
rather
sit
in
my
library
in
front
of
the
fire
in
truth
she
has
little
time
for
sitting
around
her
acting
talents
are
too
much
in
demand
in
dinner
theatres
and
in
college
auditoriums
around
the
country
recently
she
returned
from
a
working
trip
in
february
she
be
opening
in
dallas
i
have
decided
on
the
play
yet
she
says
in
spite
of
her
words
she
somehow
comes
off
as
being
thoroughly
charming
a
highly
sociable
woman
who
loves
to
attend
cocktail
parties
and
make
new
acquaintances
fontaine
is
also
a
gourmet
cook
at
christmas
i
cook
for
about
people
no
one
married
can
come
thrilled
that
one
of
my
friends
has
just
gotten
divorced
now
she
can
come
among
the
eastside
restaurants
that
fontaine
visits
frequently
are
and
the
four
seasons
when
she
has
time
to
herself
fontaine
enjoys
reading
literature
and
adapting
it
for
her
lectures
i
lecture
on
many
subjects
she
says
i
do
the
entire
jane
eyre
all
the
roles
it
takes
about
an
hour
and
a
half
more
like
a
film
reading
than
a
lecture
i
do
one
on
american
poets
and
one
on
robert
and
elizabeth
barrett
browning
all
their
own
words
then
a
new
one
has
crept
up
if
i
may
say
so
by
popular
demand
called
golden
years
i
tell
how
to
do
it
how
to
make
these
years
the
best
i
never
felt
so
happy
or
so
free
or
so
contented
as
i
am
now
born
westsider
betty
friedan
founder
of
the
women
liberation
movement
one
of
the
nonfiction
works
published
in
was
a
ranking
of
the
most
influential
persons
in
by
astrophysicist
michael
hart
he
writes
my
criterion
was
neither
fame
nor
talent
nor
nobility
of
character
but
actual
personal
influence
on
the
course
of
human
history
and
on
the
everyday
lives
of
individuals
seven
americans
were
included
in
the
and
when
magazine
requested
hart
to
expand
his
list
of
americans
to
the
first
name
he
added
was
that
of
betty
friedan
who
he
said
through
women
liberation
has
already
had
a
greater
impact
than
most
presidents
the
book
that
did
most
to
trigger
the
women
movement
was
feminine
a
brilliant
analysis
of
the
postwar
back
to
the
home
movement
when
women
were
led
to
believe
that
they
could
find
fulfillment
only
through
childbearing
and
housework
that
myth
said
friedan
resulted
in
a
sense
of
emptiness
and
loss
of
identity
for
millions
of
american
women
her
book
became
an
international
and
has
been
translated
into
more
than
a
dozen
languages
but
feminine
was
only
the
first
of
many
contributions
that
friedan
has
made
to
the
women
movement
in
she
founded
the
national
organization
for
women
now
which
today
has
more
than
members
and
is
by
far
the
most
effective
feminist
group
in
the
world
she
has
written
a
second
book
changed
my
made
countless
appearances
on
radio
and
television
and
become
one
of
the
most
lecturers
in
the
country
despite
her
public
image
as
a
hard
core
activist
betty
friedan
at
is
a
charming
decidedly
feminine
woman
who
enjoys
wearing
makeup
and
colorful
dresses
in
an
interview
at
her
brightly
decorated
apartment
high
above
lincoln
center
she
reveals
that
these
two
aspects
of
her
personality
are
not
at
all
contradictory
the
women
movement
had
to
come
it
was
an
evolutionary
thing
she
says
in
robust
throaty
bursts
of
speech
interspersed
with
long
pauses
if
i
had
not
articulated
these
ideas
in
by
somebody
else
would
have
i
think
that
it
good
that
i
did
because
what
i
had
to
say
somehow
got
to
the
essence
of
it
which
is
the
personhood
of
woman
and
not
what
later
obscured
it
with
a
kind
of
thing
it
was
largely
through
the
lobbying
efforts
of
now
that
the
senate
last
october
approved
a
extension
of
the
deadline
for
ratifying
the
equal
rights
amendment
era
so
far
of
the
required
states
have
voted
for
the
amendment
the
new
deadline
is
june
there
no
question
that
three
more
states
will
pass
it
by
that
time
says
friedan
but
it
not
going
to
be
easy
because
there
are
these
well
financed
campaigns
trying
to
block
it
they
understand
that
the
era
is
not
only
the
symbol
but
the
substance
of
what
women
have
won
that
it
will
give
them
constitutional
underpinning
forevermore
so
that
they
ca
push
women
back
to
the
status
of
the
cheap
labor
pool
the
era
will
not
do
anything
dramatic
like
change
the
bathrooms
but
it
will
ensure
for
example
that
women
have
their
own
right
for
social
security
which
they
do
have
now
you
have
to
realize
that
the
reactionary
forces
in
this
country
are
using
the
sexual
issue
as
a
kind
of
smoke
screen
to
create
a
hate
movement
they
the
same
forces
that
tried
to
prevent
labor
from
organizing
that
burnt
crosses
on
lawns
in
the
south
that
painted
swastikas
on
synagogues
now
has
made
it
priority
because
if
the
era
is
blocked
it
will
be
the
signal
to
take
back
everything
a
woman
who
smiles
and
laughs
easily
in
spite
of
her
intensity
friedan
prefers
to
be
called
not
miss
or
but
simply
betty
born
in
peoria
illinois
she
majored
in
psychology
at
smith
college
and
graduated
summa
cum
laude
in
june
after
moving
to
new

city
she
married
carl
friedan
then
a
theatrical
producer
three
children
later
the
friedans
moved
to
the
suburbs
and
it
was
there
that
she
formulated
the
ideas
for
feminine
divorced
since
friedan
maintains
a
very
close
relationship
with
her
children
who
are
at
columbia
university
the
university
of
california

school

park
for
an
hour
each

of
the
half
dozen
major
projects
she
involved

moment
the
most
significant
is
her
new

call
it

with
obvious
satisfaction

like

i
like
my

like

one
thing
i
discovered
is
that

author
of
on
a
his
name
rhymes
with
roamer
and
that
an
accurate
description
of
westsider
arthur
frommer
author
of
on
a
in
when
he
wrote
the
first
edition
on
a
arthur
was
a
dedicated
new
york
lawyer
but
the
book
became
so
popular
that
he
finally
decided
after
much
agonizing
to
leave
his
law
firm
and
become
a
travel
writer
every
year
in
the
past
two
decades
arthur
and
his
wife
hope
have
revisited
the
european
cities
covered
in
the
book
they
have
distilled
the
wisdom
from
thousands
of
letters
received
from
readers
and
they
have
revised
and
updated
the
famous
travel
book
for
the
new
edition
each
spring
it
is
still
the
world
best
selling
guide
to
europe
this
is
not
necessarily
the
glamorous
occupation
that
some
people
imagine
it
to
be
says
arthur
biting
into
a
sandwich
as
he
hope
and
their
daughter
pauline
invite
me
to
join
them
at
the
dinner
table
at
their
central
park
west
home
one
of
the
hazards
of
being
a
travel
writer
is
that
when
you
on
vacation
you
always
checking
to
see
where
the
bargains
are
or
whether
the
restaurants
are
worth
their
reputation
visited
so
many
exotic
cities
of
the
world
that
for
me
the
best
way
to
relax
is
to
stay
home
due
to
a
miscommunication
on
my
part
i
arrive
on
an
evening
exactly
one
week
later
than
the
frommers
have
expected
me
yet
they
manage
such
a
warm
welcome
that
i
end
up
staying
three
hours
they
seem
to
have
plenty
of
time
to
talk
still
there
is
a
reminder
throughout
the
evening
that
they
lead
very
busy
lives
the
constantly
ringing
telephone
one
reason
for
my
lengthy
visit
is
that
it
takes
place
on
the
same
night
as
the
second
heavyweight
championship
boxing
match
between
muhammad
ali
and
leon
spinks
arthur
and
i
sit
on
his
living
room
couch
watching
the
fight
live
on
tv
with
great
interest
rooting
for
ali
and
resuming
our
interview
between
the
rounds
ali
who
had
lost
the
first
fight
with
spinks
the
previous
february
beats
him
handily
this
time
i
a
workaholic
confesses
arthur
excusing
himself
while
he
gets
up
to
answer
another
call
from
overseas
an
energetic
man
arthur
once
worked
hours
a
day
writing
legal
briefs
and
eight
hours
a
day
on
his
book
today
he
is
the
head
of
arthur
frommer
enterprises
an
international
corporation
that
includes
a
publishing
company
a
charter
service
and
four
hotels
two
in
the
caribbean
and
two
in
europe
publishing
remains
his
biggest
enterprise
he
publishes
to
travel
guides
each
year
ranging
in
subject
matter
from
the
far
east
to
new
york
city
on
a
has
for
many
years
been
by
his
wife
hope
while
arthur
is
on
the
streets
grubbing
for
bargains
she
says
i
in
the
museums
with
her
own
career
as
an
actress
and
director
hope
does
not
fly
the
atlantic
quite
as
often
as
her
husband
says
arthur
i
go
to
europe
like
other
people
commute
to
long
island
sometimes
i
go
without
even
a
change
of
clothes
pauline
frommer
made
her
first
trip
to
europe
at
the
age
of
two
and
a
half
months
bright
and
precocious
she
seems
a
natural
to
succeed
her
father
in
the
business
one
day
arthur
frommer
success
story
began
shortly
after
he
graduated
from
yale
law
school
in
while
serving
in
the
army
in
europe
he
used
every
weekend
to
travel
at
the
end
of
my
stay
in
the
army
he
recalls
having
nothing
to
do
i
sat
down
and
wrote
a
little
volume
called
gi
guide
to
it
was
written
strictly
from
memory
it
had
no
prices
or
phone
numbers
i
went
home
and
started
practicing
law
then
i
got
a
cable
saying
that
all
copies
had
sold
out
immediately
arthur
used
his
first
summer
vacation
from
the
law
firm
to
go
back
to
europe
and
rewrite
his
travel
guide
for
civilian
readers
it
became
a
monster
which
ate
up
my
life
but
he
has
never
regretted
his
choice
of
careers
the
book
coincided
with
a
revolution
of
american
travel
habits
says
arthur
not
giving
himself
credit
for
being
a
prime
force
behind
this
revolution
when
i
was
in
college
it
was
unheard
of
for
young
people
to
go
off
to
europe
it
was
too
far
too
expensive
the
students
of
the
early
became
the
first
students
in
history
to
travel
in
great
numbers
to
europe
many
people
think
the
country
was
greatly
changed
by
this
massive
travel
arthur
and
hope
moved
to
the
west
side
in
just
after
their
daughter
was
born
among
their
favorite
neighborhood
businesses
delpino
shoes
which
has
some
of
the
lowest
prices
in
the
city
for
quality
italian
footwear
and
the
jean
warehouse
where
pauline
buys
many
of
her
clothes
these
days
while
hope
is
busy
directing
a
play
by
pamela
arthur
is
working
on
several
new
projects
one
is
a
course
he
will
be
teaching
at
the
new
school
starting
in
february
titled
great
cities
of
western
europe
the
course
will
concentrate
on
urban
problems
and
their
political
and
social
solutions
but
arthur
biggest
ambition
these
days
is
to
expand
his
chartered
tour
of
jerusalem
into
a
package
for
jerusalem
and
cairo
such
a
tour
he
believes
would
help
create
a
bond
of
understanding
in
the
middle
east
it
a
dream
of
mine
says
arthur
that
we
might
be
a
force
for
peace
sometime
it
may
not
happen
overnight
but
i
sure
it
will
come

his

glee
we
have
been
sued
many
times
we
never
been
beaten
we
had
two
cases
that
went
to
the
supreme
court
the
first
was
on
alfred
newman
the
character
who
appears
on
the
magazine
cover
two
different
people
claimed
it
was
theirs
a
woman
by
the
name
of
stuff
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
schmeck
neither
one
knew
about
the
other
one
and
we
did
tell
them
it
was
pretty
fun
when
they
all
got
to
court
and
found
that
both
of
them
were
claiming
to
own
alfred
through
a
series
of
decisions
the
supreme
court
decided
that
neither
one
of
them
owned
alfred
and
we
were
free
to
use
him
the
other
case
was
when
irving
berlin
and
a
number
of
other
songwriters
sued
because
we
used
to
publish
a
lot
of
articles
of
song
parodies
which
we
say
were
sung
to
the
tune
of
and
they
took
umbrage
to
that
they
said
that
when
people
would
read
the
words
they
were
singing
their
music
in

heads

then
his
father
was
killed
in
an
accident
and
gaines
decided
to
enter
the
comic
business
himself
i
started
putting
out
some
very
undistinguished
dreadful
stuff
because
i
did
know
where
i
was
going
after
three
years
albert
feldstein
editor
joined
me
and
we
just
had
a
rapport
right
away
we
started
putting
out
stuff

we
had
a
feeling
for
science
fiction
horror

comics
known
as

are
today
worth
up
to

of
their
genre
they
became
the
target
of
a
senate
subcommittee
on
juvenile
delinquency
largely
because
of
public
pressure
gaines
dropped
all
of
them
except
which
he
changed
from
a

into

more
adult

that
kind
of
thing
they
have
no
maliciousness
toward
tourists
i
was
almost
shot
there
twice
but
it
was
by
mistake
things
are
so
relaxed
around
the
headquarters
that
eight
out
of
the
nine
staffers
have
been
with
the
publication
for
more
than
years
our
writers
and
artists
are
says
gaines
most
of
them
have
been
with
us
years
also
we
get
quite
a
few
unsolicited
manuscripts
but
most
of
them
unfortunately
are
not
usable
every
once
in
a
while
we
get
one
and
then
we
got
a
big
day
of
rejoicing
we
always
looking
for
writers
we
do
need
artists
but
you
have
enough
writers
and
we
firmly
believe
that
the
writer
is
god
because
if
you
do
have
a
writer
you
do
have
movies
you
do
have
television
you
do
have
books
you
do
have
plays
you
do
have
magazines
you
do
have
comics
you
do
have
anything
we
do
assign
articles
the
writers
come
to
us
with
what
they
want
to
write
and
as
long
as
it
funny
we
buy
it
and
we
do
care
what
point
of
view
because
has
no
editorial
point
of
view
we
not
left
and
we
not
right
we
all
mixed
up

our
writers
are

ralph

publisher
of
less
than
two
months
ago
the
supreme
court
passed
an
edict
allowing
the
police
to
raid
the
files
of
newspaper
offices
in
search
of
information
relating
to
a
crime
if
they
came
here
i

at

entrance
and
block
their
way
says
ralph

gazing
out
the
window
at
his
suite
of
offices
near
columbus
circle
i
do
care
if
they
arrest
me
he
adds
in
his
thick
brooklyn
accent
the
ginzburg
means
what
he
says
he
the
publisher
of
which
is
mailed
each
month
to
million
subscribers
it
is
the
most
successful
item
he
has
ever
published
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
would
risk
losing
it
and
going
to
jail
because
ginzburg
has
done
so
already
in
a
flamboyant
career
marked
by
much
notoriety
he
has
emerged
as
one
of
the
most
important
figures
of
his
generation
in
expanding
the
freedom
of
the
press
of
the
six
magazines
and
newspapers
that
ginzburg
has
founded
none
has
caused
such
a
stir
as
his
first
one
which
lasted
from
to
it
was
the
first
really
classy
magazine
on
love
and
sex
in
american
history
he
says
i
signed
up
subscribers
right
away
at
a
year
many
leading
american
artists
contributed
to
it
the
big
difference
is
that
it
was
sold
entirely
through
the
mails
our
promotion
of
subscriptions
through
the
mail
got
a
lot
of
complaints
about
complaints
in
fact
more
than
the
post
office
had
ever
received
up
to
that
time
ralph
ginzburg
was
charged
with
sending
obscene
material
through
the
mails
and
was
forced
to
suspend
publication
while
the
debate
went
on
most
washington
lawyers
after
examining
the
magazine
concluded
that
it
was
not
obscene
but
the
case
became
a
political
issue
and
in
years
after
the
crime
had
taken
place
ginzburg
was
ordered
to
serve
an
term
at
the
federal
prison
in
allenwood
pennsylvania
his
imprisonment
led
to
a
nationwide
outcry
by
intellectuals
and
public
officials
not
long
after
the
demise
of
ginzburg
started
another
magazine
called
it
too
ended
over
a
lawsuit
this
time
the
plaintiff
was
senator
barry
goldwater
he
sued
the
magazine
for
million
on
the
charge
of
libel
and
was
awarded
in
damages
it
was
a
compromise
as
jury
decisions
frequently
are
remarks
ginzburg
unfortunately
i
did
have
very
much
money
back
then
and
it
wiped
us
out
describing
the
case
he
said
in
when
goldwater
was
running
for
president
he
advocated
the
use
of
nuclear
weapons
in
vietnam
i
thought
the
guy
was
out
of
his
mind
and
i
wondered
if
anyone
else
had
the
same
suspicion
we
polled
all
the
members
of
the
american
medical
association
who
were
listed
as
psychiatrists
and
asked
them
if
they
thought
goldwater
was
fit
to
be
president
we
printed
their
replies
and
their
diagnoses
both
the
case
and
the
goldwater
case
made
the
american
public
examine
some
questions
what
is
obscene
what
is
libelous
ginzburg
helped
to
establish
new
definitions
for
these
terms
and
in
so
doing
widened
the
power
of
the
press
his
third
publication
existed
from
to
it
was
born
during
the
vietnam
uprising
in
this
country
he
explains
it
was
a
magazine
of
art
and
politics
and
had
no
ad
revenue
in
the
same
year
that
folded
he
began
a
newsletter
called
soon
it
expanded
into
a
newspaper
it
was
launched
says
ginzburg
because
we
felt
that
the
only
existing
periodical
in
the
area
of
consumer
interest
was
broad
enough
spending
money
is
more
than
buying
appliances
while
does
carry
many
valuable
tips
on
personal
finance
it
also
has
a
considerable
amount
of
sensationalism
that
would
seem
at
home
in
the
even
so
ginzburg
managerial
skills
his
nonstop
working
habits
and
his
literary
expertise
he
has
written
several
books
have
made
a
winner
using
the
same
staff
of
along
with
many
writers
he
now
publishes
two
other
monthly
newspapers
as
well
and
extra
he
has
been
a
westsider
for
years
and
his
publishing
company
media
is
located
on
west
street
if
ginzburg
has
a
single
goal
right
now
it
to
saved
up
enough
money
to
enable
me
to
put
out
a
periodical
exactly
like
was
it
was
pure
pleasure
for
me
there
was
no
commercial
compromise
but
even
though
this
is
a
corporation
here
i
ca
afford
it
at
the
moment
money
is
important
in
publishing
i
have
to
spend
percent
of
my
time
and
effort
chasing
the
buck
i
guess
i
lucky
most
people
spend
percent
of
their
time
that
way

insecurity
and
to
griffith
who
taught
me
that
it
was
more
fun
to
work
than
to

she
recalls
with
merriment
describing
how
her

wound
up
in

need
lillian
and
her
sister

followed

loved
the

and
everybody
would
read
it
to
me
on
the
train
or
waiting
for
the
train
well
i
finally
had
it
read
to
me
so
much
i
knew
it
by
heart
and
that
how
i
learned
to
read
when
we
were
travelling
around

would
always
take
her

we
were

letters

many
from

my

five

why
should
i
lose
percent
of

one
of
the
things
i
trying
to
do
now
is
to
bring
back
silent

and
beautiful
music

doing
it
with

ecstatic
review
her

include
an
honorary

dozens
of
major

roles
and
a

that
she
and
directed
but
miss
gish
with
characteristic
modesty
prefers
to
talk
about
her
friends
and
family
bitterness
and
complaint
are
alien
to
her
nature
although
life
has
not
always
been
easy
she
never
married
and
her
mother
to
whom
she
was
highly
devoted
spent
the
last
years
of
her
life
as
an
invalid
but
she
was
never
unhappy
testifies
lillian
she
was
always
the
first
to
laugh
and
the
gayest
following
her
mother
death
in
the
apartment
was
given
to
dokey
her
nurse
who
died
the
following
year
then
lillian
and
dorothy

shared
the

until
dorothy

lillian
now
lives
alone
she
has
no
opportunity
to
be
lonely
besides
work
travel
and
reading
her
favorite
activities
she
has
godchildren
one
thing
that
helps
keep
her
young
says
miss
gish
is
her
intense
curiosity
i
was
born
with
it
thank
heavens
i
feel
sorry
for
people
who
say
they
bored
how
in
the
world
can
anyone
be
bored
in
the
world
today
how
can
fiction
complete
with
what
going
on
a
few
of
her

have
been
lost
forever
since
no
original

exist
in
good
condition
most
however
are
still
shown

the

they
get

milton
glaser
has
fond
memories
of
his
boyhood
in
the
bronx
he
especially
likes
recalling
an
event
that
took
place
in
the
year
that
was
founded
when
i
was
years
old
a
cousin
of
mine
said
you
like
to
see
a
pigeon
he
had
a
paper
bag
with
him
and
i
thought
he
meant
there
was
a
pigeon
in
it
but
then
he
took
out
a
pencil
and
drew
a
picture
of
a
bird
i
was
so
astonished
that
you
could
invent
reality
that
i
never
recovered
from
it
the
only
thing
i
wanted
to
do
in
my
life
was
to
make
images
milton
and
his
wife
shirley
moved
to
the
west
side
last
august
i
guess
it
was
the
opportunity
to
find
the
right
physical
space
i
like
the
neighborhood
because
of
the
mix
of
working
class
middle
class
and
upper
class
that
really
is
the
richest
thing
the
urban
scene
offers
the
number
of
westside

listed
in

has
sharply
increased
over
the
years

look
in

shows
two

men
in

one
is
lying
on

what
is
architecture
it
the
whole
built
environment
it
the
outside
of
a
building
the
inside
the
function
it
serves
social
needs
physical
needs
and
a
building
has
an
obligation
to
work
well
with
the
buildings
around
it
at
least
in

city
the
speaker
is
paul
goldberger
architecture
critic
for
the
york
his
immaculate
suit
and
tie
refined
manners
dry
wit
and
somewhat
formal
way
of
speaking
seem
to
mark
him
a
timesman
even
more
than
the
carefully
researched
colorfully
written
articles
that
have
poured
out
of
his
pen
in
the
last
four
years
as
a
critic
goldberger
is
accustomed
to
vocalizing
opinions
and
facts
in
equal
measure
his
on
architectural
styles
is
demonstrated
by
his
apartment
a
lavish
ultramodernized
suite
of
high
ceilinged
rooms
inside
one
of
the
oldest
buildings
on
central
park
west
the
interview
begins
with
a
trick
question
what
is
the
third
tallest
building
in
new
york
answer
the
empire
state
building
he
fields
it
without
cracking
a
smile
i
guess
the
question
is
do
you
consider
the
world
trade
center
two
buildings
he
says
i
guess
it
like
asking
whether
grover
cleveland
was
two
presidents
or
one
because
he
served
two
terms
the
world
trade
center
was
not
necessary
built
functionally
or
very
pleasing
aesthetically
it
was
built
as
a
kind
of
symbol
of
power
by
the
port
authority
i
used
to
it
now
human
beings
can
adapt
to
anything
i
even
like
going
to
the
restaurant
at
the
top
and
the
restaurant
at
the
bottom
it
the
floors
in
the
middle
i
do
like
he
points
to
the
new
citicorp
center
on
east
street
as
an
example
of
modern
architecture
at
its
best
and
the
mosquelike
cultural
center
at
columbus
circle
as
an
example
of
the
opposite
it
pretty
horrible
says
the
critic
agreeing
with
a
newspaper
writer
who
recently
labeled
the
cultural
center
one
of
the
ugliest
buildings
in
manhattan
it
a
very
silly
building
it
so
obviously
dumb
but
it
does
particularly
bother
me
it
almost
innocent
it
so
silly
lincoln
center
too
draws
his
barbs
i
find
it
very
pretentious
rather
boring
really
it
a
set
of
imitations
of
classical
themes
the
buildings
are
an
unfortunate
compromise
because
the
builders
were
afraid
to
build
something
really
modern
or
to
design
something
that
really
looked
like
a
classical
building
there
a
feeling
that
they
sort
of
want
to
be
modern
and
sort
of
want
to
be
classical
and
end
up
being
a
very
unsatisfying
compromise
a
new
jersey
native
who
developed
a
passion
for
architecture
in
his
earliest
years
paul
goldberger
attended
yale
university
and
then
worked
as
a
general
reporter
for
another
newspaper
several
years
later
he
became
an
editorial
assistant
for
the
in
there
came
an
opening
for
an
architectural
writer
and
because
the
knew
of
his
background
goldberger
was
given
the
first
shot
at
the
job
it
was
fabulous
he
recalls
because
it
was
what
i
always
wanted
to
do
and
it
was
very
much
a
matter
of
luck
of
being
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
his
articles
appear
most
often
in
the
daily
louise
huxtable
remains
the
chief
architectural
writer
for
the
sunday
paper
why
would
a
sophisticated
timesman
choose
the
west
side
over
the
east
there
are
many
more
wonderful
buildings
on
the
west
side
says
goldberger
unfortunately
not
many
of
the
buildings
on
the
west
side
have
been
kept
up
as
well
as
the
east
side
in
terms
of
apartment
house
architecture
central
park
west
is
probably
the
best
street
in
new
york
it
has
all
the
grandeur
and
beauty
and
monumentality
of
fifth
avenue
and
it
also
has
the
relaxed
atmosphere
there
not
one
west
side
he
continues
there
at
least
around
here
is
one
neighborhood
riverside
drive
is
another
up
by
columbia
is
another
one
of
the
reasons
i
like
my
own
neighborhood
is
because
though
it
is
very
much
west
side
it
handy
to
the
east
side
and
midtown
i
walk
through
the
park
all
the
time
any
chance
that
manhattan
skyscrapers
will
eventually
weigh
down
the
island
no
replies
the
critic
emphatically
first
the
island
is
very
very
solid
rock
and
nothing
could
cause
it
to
sink
the
other
factor
especially
today
is
that
buildings
are
not
all
that
heavy
because
being
built
with
lighter
materials
and
more
modern
engineering
methods
so
a
huge
new
building
like
the
citicorp
which
is
feet
high
is
not
any
heavier
than
a
building
feet
high
built
years
ago
and
since
we
do
have
earthquakes
this
is
probably
the
safest
environment
in
the
world
to
build
a
skyscraper
although
studying
and
writing
about
architecture
is
more
than
a
job
goldberger
manages
to
keep
abreast
of
the
legal
aspects
of
buildings
as
well
including
tenants
rights
rent
control
zoning
laws
and
redlining
the
new
york
city
landmarks
preservation
commission
is
another
of
his
interests
i
think
landmarking
is
crucial
to
the
city
he
testifies
a
city
exists
in
time
as
much
as
space
it
the
mixture
of
new
and
old
buildings
that
gives
the
city
life
and
vitality

by
this
time
had
reached
his
party
and
was
inviting
the
young
actress
on
the
other
end
to
a
broadway
opening
that
night
he
chatted
with
her
for
several
minutes
his
jack
bennyish
voice
breaking
occasionally
into
rich
laughter
sitting
upright
behind
a
table
covered
with
papers
folders
notebooks
and
play
scripts
the
jacketless
goldman
looked
far
more
relaxed
that
i
had
expected
of
a
man
who
in
his
years
as
an
agent
has
handled
the
careers
of
close
to
actors
and
actresses
among
those
he
has
helped
discover
are
jack
lemmon
walter
matthau
grace
kelly
lee
marvin
charlton
heston
and
faye
dunaway
and
though
goldman
has
become
a
celebrity
in
his
own
right
he
still
exudes
the
charm
of
a
friendly
neighbor
talking
over
a
fence
the
appearance
is
no
deception
he
owes
his
success
not
to
tactics
but
to
an
encyclopedic
knowledge
of
the
theatre
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
a
keen
judgment
of
which
shows
are
best
for
his
clients
and
a
record
for
trustworthiness
by
title
he
is
vice
president
in
charge
of
the
theatrical
division
of
international
creative
management
which
is
matched
in
size
only
by
the
william
morris
agency
unofficially
he
serves
as
father
confessor
rabbi
psychiatrist
and
best
friend
to
many
of
the
top
stars
he
represents
attending
the
theatre
up
to
five
times
a
week
he
is
always
on
the
lookout
for
new
clients
his
weekends
are
devoted
to
reading
and
casting
new
plays
i
ca
resist
talent
and
when
i
see
a
talented
young
actor
or
actress
i
want
very
much
to
help
realize
their
potential
by
opening
as
many
doors
as
i
can
for
them
he
explained
gripping
the
arms
of
his
chair
i
think
of
my
job
as
work
for
me
it
fun
and
i
never
know
where
the
one
begins
and
the
other
ends
because
i
that
lucky
individual
whose
private
life
and
public
life
are
one
and
the
same
thing
every
year
he
takes
a
vacation
to
europe
on
the
queen
elizabeth
ii
in
paris
for
a
week
and
london
for
about
three
weeks
in
slow
carefully
chosen
sentences
he
stated
i
represent
many
english
clients
because
my
knowledge
of
the
english
theatre
is
probably
better
than
anyone
else
in
the
american
theatre
every
year
in
london
i
get
the
same
suite
in
the
savoy
hotel
and
give
great
parties
i
go
to
at
least
eight
plays
a
week
sometimes
as
many
as
so
i
get
to
see
all
the
plays
in
london
and
i
know
all
the
english
actors
and
they
know
me
among
his
british
clients
sir
laurence
olivier
sir
ralph
richardson
and
sir
john
gielgud
american
performers
excel
in
the
musical
comedy
theatre
where
dancers
and
singers
also
very
often
are
fine
actors
this
is
not
true
in
england
dancers
are
especially
hard
to
cast
in
london
though
i
think
that
is
changing
now
it
sad
that
the
american
theatre
ca
support
serious
plays
they
either
musicals
or
they
comedies
i
think
a
healthy
theatre
should
be
able
to
support
the
works
of
serious
playwrights
this
season
we
happen
to
have
on
broadway
an
important
play
by
an
american
playwright
arthur
kopit
which
stars
our
client
constance
cummings
who
is
an
american
actress
who
went
to
england
and
made
her
reputation
abroad
and
has
now
returned
here
to
great
acclaim
a
native
of
new
brunswick
new
jersey
goldman
witnessed
his
first
broadway
show
in
the
summer
of
and
from
that
day
forward
the
theatre
was
his
passion
for
years
he
worked
as
a
tire
salesman
at
a
business
then
through
his
friend
arnold
weissberger
a
noted
lawyer
goldman
was
offered
a
job
as
a
theatrical
agent
at
no
base
salary
but
with
a
weekly
expense
account
and
a
percent
interest
in
any
clients
he
signed
up
success
came
to
him
almost
at
once
a
lifelong
bachelor
goldman
today
shares
an
apartment
with
weissberger
on
the
upper
east
side
his
favorite
local
restaurant
is
the
four
seasons
i
go
there
all
the
time
for
lunch
that
my
main
meal
of
the
day
i
think
it
the
best
restaurant
in
the
world
the
actor
life
he
believes
is
a
sad
and
a
difficult
one
every
time
you
get
a
good
part
the
next
part
has
to
be
bigger
more
money
as
you
reach
the
top
it
becomes
tougher
and
tougher
to
get
those
parts
nevertheless
goldman
does
not
find
his
own
job
at
all
frustrating
pressures
yes
there
are
many
pressures
but
i
have
said
this
before
there
are
so
many
rewards
for
me
when
i
see
a
client
in
whom
i
believe
get
a
great
break
in
the
theatre
or
films
of
television
it
a
source
of
great
satisfaction
and
with
the
number
of
clients
i
represent
each
day
brings
some
rewards
that
why
i
often
said
to
clients
have
many
lives
to
live
eastsider
tammy
grimes
star
of
at
the
american
place
theatre
tammy
grimes
is
one
of
the
few
broadway
stars
to
have
received
tony
awards
in
two
categories
for
best
musical
comedy
actress
in
unsinkable
molly
and
for
best
dramatic
actress
in
noel
coward
in
a
sense
she
is
molly
brown
personified
a
powerful
stage
presence
whose
charm
beauty
and
pure
talent
make
her
shine
in
every
production
she
takes
part
in
regardless
of
the
overall
merit
of
the
show
itself
her
disappointments
have
been
at
times
as
spectacular
as
her
triumphs
for
example
there
was
her
shot
at
network
television
in
the
early
tammy
grimes
which
lasted
only
episodes
because
she
says
the
writing
the
concept
and
the
talent
never
really
got
together
and
i
blame
myself
for
that
because
if
your
name
up
there
you
are
responsible
for
the
product
her
marriage
to
actor
christopher
plummer
ended
in
divorce
after
four
years
but
had
the
happy
result
of
producing
a
daughter
amanda
plummer
who
is
now
a
successful
actress
herself
tammy
played
molly
brown
on
broadway
for
the
show
entire
run
but
the
movie
role
went
to
debbie
reynolds
she
got
some
rave
reviews
for
her
acting
in
a
broadway
thriller
named
this
year
but
the
show
closed
within
weeks
when
that
happened
she
quickly
started
working
on
a
new
show
by
oliver
hailey
that
is
scheduled
to
open
on
june
at
the
american
place
theatre
on
west
street
it
about
three
women
who
get
together
on
father
day
says
miss
grimes
in
an
interview
at
her
upper
east
side
apartment
they
live
in
the
same
building
and
they
divorced
it
shows
how
the
three
of
them
are
coping
with
the
situation
my
feeling
is
that
they
do
want
to
be
divorced
it
a
very
play
a
comedy
it
at
the
same
theatre
where
cold
started
the
interview
takes
place
in
her
softly
decorated
bedroom
looking
out
on
a
garden
tammy
is
propped
up
on
pillows
beneath
the
covers
smoking
a
cigarette
and
sipping
a
bottle
of
tab
as
she
apologizes
for
her
condition
it
may
have
been
the
caviar
i
had
last
night
she
says
cheerful
in
spite
of
her
discomfort
her
pixyish
features
expand
easily
into
a
grin
and
at
she
has
lost
none
of
the
childlike
playfulness
that
first
propelled
her
to
stardom
but
the
most
surprising
quality
about
tammy
grimes
is
her
throaty
british
accent
although
she
has
done
little
work
in
england
her
normal
speaking
voice
is
far
more
british
than
american
a
fact
which
for
some
reason
she
strenuously
denies
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
doing
british
comedy
she
explains
but
i
do
sound
british
a
native
of
lynn
massachusetts
i
just
happened
to
be
born
on
the
way
home
from
a
party
she
grew
up
in
boston
and
decided
early
to
become
an
actress
when
she
was
thornton
wilder
saw
her
in
a
production
of
his
classic
play
skin
of
our
he
declared
young
lady
even
tallulah
bankhead
did
do
the
things
you
did
to
the
role
by
her
early
she
was
performing
in
numerous
off
broadway
shows
a
singing
act
she
developed
for
one
of
new
york
leading
supper
clubs
won
her
a
rave
review
in
magazine
and
shortly
after
her
birthday
she
received
her
first
starring
role
on
broadway
in
an
ill
fated
noel
coward
production
called
after
the
following
year
saw
unsinkable
molly
reach
broadway
it
was
the
most
expensive
musical
ever
mounted
until
then
and
became
a
smash
tammy
played
the
role
times
she
missed
only
performances
i
believe
that
if
you
can
speak
you
should
be
up
there
she
says
even
today
people
will
stop
me
and
say
came
in
from
north
carolina
to
see
you
and
when
we
got
to
the
theatre
you
were
there
as
a
television
performer
she
has
appeared
as
a
guest
star
in
dozens
of
dramatic
series
situation
comedies
and
variety
shows
she
has
played
numerous
shakespearean
roles
made
five
movies
done
a
great
deal
of
radio
work
and
recorded
numerous
albums
including
several
for
children
an
animal
lover
she
gives
her
time
freely
to
such
groups
as
the
american
horse
protection
association
and
friends
of
the
animals
tammy
has
been
at
her
present
east
side
address
since
though
she
likes
to
cook
she
also
frequents
many
restaurants
including
veau
and
gino
asked
to
evaluate
her
career
as
a
whole
tammy
notes
that
all
but
one
of
the
shows
she
has
done
seemed
to
open
and
close
in
a
natural
way
there
always
a
reason
why
a
play
ends
prematurely
it
nice
to
please
the
public
but
you
ca
constantly
be
thinking
that
they
will
accept
this
but
not
something
else
from
you
you
have
to
go
by
your
feelings
if
something
is
good
the
public
will
go
to
see
it
westsider
delores
hall
star
of
arms
too
short
to
box
with
it
just
after
on
a
wednesday
evening
when
delores
hall
steps
out
of
the
lyceum
theatre
stage
door
onto
street
at
least
fans
are
waiting
they
give
a
cheer
as
she
emerges
and
rush
toward
her
delores
hall
smiles
broadly
as
she
autographs
their
programs
for
these
fans
are
hers
she
has
worked
hard
to
become
a
broadway
star
and
now
in
arms
too
short
to
box
with
she
is
precisely
that
no
i
not
really
tired
says
hall
a
few
minutes
later
over
a
snack
at
the
cafe
i
still
at
a
peak
of
energy
from
the
show
that
was
my
second
performance
today
but
i
could
do
another
one
if
i
had
to
asking
delores
about
her
earlier
days
brings
a
flood
of
memories
and
laughter
she
a
happy
bouncy
woman
and
seems
as
pleased
to
talk
as
any
friendly
neighbor
when
i
was
i
discovered
i
had
vibrato
she
recalls
my
mother
taught
me
everything
i
know
about
singing
i
can
remember
her
hitting
me
in
the
stomach
showing
me
how
to
breathe
but
whatever
she
did
she
did
it
right
i
was
when
i
first
sang
in
public
they
stood
me
on
a
table
i
can
remember
some
people
throwing
pieces
born
in
kansas
city
slightly
more
than
years
ago
delores
grew
up
with
music
in
her
ears
her
father
played
the
bass
for
count
basie
and
her
mother
was
and
still
is
a
missionary
in
the
church
of
god
in
christ
which
produces
gospel
singers
the
way
southern
universities
raise
football
players
young
delores
began
singing
regularly
at
the
church
services
an
activity
she
continued
when
her
family
moved
to
los
angeles
when
delores
entered
college
she
formed
her
own
gospel
group
an
act
so
popular
that
she
soon
left
school
to
become
a
musician
later
harry
belafonte
invited
the
delores
hall
singers
to
tour
with
him
for
six
months
harry
is
a
beautiful
man
delores
grins
he
came
to
the
show
a
month
or
so
ago
and
afterwards
he
went
backstage
and
somebody
introduced
us
he
said
hall
i
heard
so
much
about
you
and
then
he
screamed
and
we
jumped
into
each
other
arms
delores
has
lived
in
new
york
since
five
years
ago
she
moved
to
the
west

people
are
so
much
warmer
here
she
says
her
remarkable
singing
has
won
her
parts
in
half
a
dozen
broadway
shows
but
with
for
the
first
time
she
suddenly
found
herself
the
star
of
a
hit

in
a
highly
positive
review
in

been
packing
the
lyceum
since
christmas
and
advance
ticket
sales
go
to
october
in
spite
of
hall
unbroken
musical
success
her
life
has
not
been
without
personal
tragedy
just
before
the
broadway
premiere
of
last
december
she
suffered
the
heartbreaking
loss
of
her
only
brother
a
minister
it
was
very
hard
to
open
the
show
she
recalls
but
i
got
through
it
with
the
help
of
god
delores
lives
on
west
street
with
her
husband
of
seven
years
michael
goodstone
whenever
she
can
delores
joins
michael
at
temple
in
westchester
county
i
find
it
very
uplifting
spiritually
because
i
believe
god
is
everywhere
each
sunday
the
couple
both
attend
the
church
of
god
in
christ
some
people
call
it

after
the
service
we
go
downstairs
for
a
piece
of
the
best
fried
chicken
hall
face
glows
with
pride
when
she
speaks
of
deardra
her
daughter
from
a
previous
marriage
my
daughter
is
a
singer
too
she
won
the

award
from
her
school
deardra
is
hoping
to
enter
new
york
high
school
of
performing
arts
this
fall
plans
for
the
future
delores
would
like
to
try
grand
opera
someday
possibly
the
role
of
aida
and
a
new
record
album
is
not
far
off
several
years
ago
she
recorded
her
first
album
for
rca
since
she
began
drawing
national
attention
in
some
tempting
offers
have
come
in
from
recording
companies
and
her
manager
is
in
the
process
of
negotiating
a
contract
the
new
album
may
be
either
gospel
or
middle
of
the
road
praying
very
hard
so
it
depends
on
what
the
lord
says
but
for
the
moment
delores
hall
is
well
satisfied
at
filling
the
lyceum
theatre
seven
times
each
week
this
show
i
love
so
much
she
says
her
eyes
sparkling
because
it
takes
me
home
westsider
lionel
hampton
king
of
the
newport
jazz
festival
the
world
greatest
celebration
of
jazz
the
newport
jazz
festival
will
get
off
the
ground
on
june
its
consecutive
year
during
the
day
festival
in
indoor
and
outdoor
settings
all
over
manhattan
and
beyond
the
most
important
names
in
jazz
will
stage
nearly
major
musical
events
more
than
half
the
concerts
appropriately
enough
will
take
place
on
the
west
side
in
carnegie
hall
and
avery
fisher
hall
and
just
as
appropriately
this
year
festival
will
be
dedicated
to
a
westsider
whose
life
has
been
an
inspiration
to
millions
of
people
not
only
for
the
great
music
he
has
created
but
for
a
heart
as
large
as
the
grand
canyon
to
call
him
merely
a
giant
of
jazz
could
be
an
understatement
because
they
do
come
any
bigger
than
lionel
hampton
ask
a
dozen
people
what
the
name
lionel
hampton
means
to
them
and
you
likely
to
get
a
dozen
answers
all
of
them
correct
in
his
years
as
a
professional
musician
hamp
has
used
his
remarkable
gifts
humbly
wisely
and
unselfishly
music
historians
will
always
remember
him
as
the
man
who
introduced
the
vibraphone
into
jazz
this
he
accomplished
in
while
playing
with
louis
armstrong
ever
since
hampton
has
been
known
as
the
world
foremost
master
of
the
instrument
he
is
also
a
leading
drummer
pianist
singer
arranger
bandleader
and
composer
at
he
continues
to
work
nearly
weeks
out
of
the
year
taking
his
band
to
every
corner
of
the
and
europe
but
whether
he
making
a
live
recording
in
a
nightclub
or
performing
his
own
symphonic
works
with
the
boston
symphony
orchestra
lionel
hampton
glows
with
a
spiritual
energy
that
extends
far
beyond
his
music
it
in
the
afternoon
when
i
arrive
at
hampton
neat
modern
apartment
overlooking
lincoln
center
i
sit
on
the
sofa
talking
with
chuck

a
few
minutes
later
hampton
emerges
from
the
bedroom
and
plops
down
on
the
sofa
beside
me
wearing
a
dressing
gown
slippers
and
the
famous
smile
that
no
one
can
imitate
after
the
introductions
i
ask
about
his
most
recent
concerts
i
still
trying
to
get
myself
together

says
almost
apologetically

his
rich
southern

played
all
over
scandinavia

the
whole
drum

some
years
later
hampton
was
invited
to
join
the
benny
goodman
band
in
new
york
his
acceptance
of
the
offer
had
great
social
significance
for
it
was
the
first
time
that
blacks
and
whites
played
together
in
a
major
musical
group
from
to
he
lived
in
central
harlem
then
after
moving
to
the
west
side
hampton
decided
that
he
wanted
to
help
upgrade
his
old
neighborhood
so
on
the
advice
of
governor
nelson
rockefeller
he
raised

in
seed

and
filed
an
application
with

when
i
was
a

our

when
he
ran

i
do
know
that
high
politics
but
i
know
i
always
had
high
esteem
for
him
in
a
political
campaign
last
year
hampton
threw
his
support
behind
ernest
morial
a
black
man
who
was
running
for
mayor
of
new
orleans
before
hampton
stepped
in
morial
was
sixth

the
polls
i
sent
my
man
chuck

down
there
to
put
some
life
into
his
campaign
chuck
put
a
thousand
placards
all

david
hawk
executive
director
of

international
during
the
final
days
of
world
war
ii
a
captured
resistance
member
sat
alone
in
a
black
prison
cell
tired
hungry
tortured
and
convinced
of
approaching
death
after
weeks
of
torment
the
prisoner
was
sure
that
there
was
no
hope
that
no
one
knew
or
cared
but
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
door
of
the
cell
opened
and
the
jailer
shouting
abuse
into
the
darkness
threw
a
loaf
of
bread
onto
the
dirt
floor
the
prisoner
by
this
time
ravenous
tore
open
the
loaf
inside
was
a
matchbox
inside
the
matchbox
were
matches
and
a
scrap
of
paper
the
prisoner
lit
a
match
on
the
paper
was
a
single
word
coraggio
courage
take
courage
do
give
up
do
give
in
we
are
trying
to
help
you
coraggio
the
prisoner
never
did
find
out
who
wrote
the
message
but
the
spark
of
hope
it
provided
may
well
have
saved
his
life
the
story
is
told
in
the
newspaper
of
amnesty
international
one
of
the
largest
branches
of
the
worldwide
human
rights
organization
that
received
the
nobel
peace
prize
for
david
hawk
executive
director
of
amnesty
international
sits
behind
his
desk
on
a
weekday
morning
talking
about
how
the
group
originated
and
what
it
has
done
to
earn
the
prize
it
was
started
in
britain
in
by
a
lawyer
named
peter
benenson
says
hawk
whose
name
belies
the
fact
that
he
has
been
involved
in
civil
rights
for
nearly
half
of
his
years
it
started
over
a
trial
that
was
going
on
in
portugal
benenson
launched
a
campaign
to
call
attention
to
the
portuguese
prisoners
soon
the
idea
became
so
popular
that
a
permanent
organization
was
created
chapters
sprang
up
in
other
countries
and
members
began
to
work
toward
freeing
prisoners
of
conscience
on
every
continent
in
the
past
years
amnesty
international
or
amnesty
for
short
has
aided
in
securing
the
release
of
nearly
individuals
who
were
imprisoned
not
for
crimes
but
for
personal
beliefs
that
went
against
their
governments
official
policies
we
a
nuisance
factor
says
hawk
we
organize
and
publicity
campaigns
on
behalf
of
individual
victims
of
human
rights
violations
it
the
letters
and
the
publicity
that
are
amnesty
tools
for
securing
their
release
or
bettering
their
conditions
while
they
in
at
first
it
sounds
strange
to
think
that
people
sitting
in
living
rooms
in
the
united
states
can
help
someone
in
a
fortress
prison
on
an
island
in
indonesia
or
in
siberia
you
deluge
certain
people
with
so
many
letters
that
eventually
it
becomes
an
issue
then
the
government
asks
holding
this
person
worth
the
trouble
and
on
occasion
the
answer
is
no
the
secret
of
amnesty
success
is
its
huge
number
of
volunteers
in
countries
who
work
on
the
case
of
a
particular
prisoner
for
years
if
necessary
they
send
letters
and
telegrams
not
only
to
government
officials
but
also
to
the
prisoner
himself
at
times
they
send
packages
or
give
financial
aid
to
his
family
or
arrange
for
legal
aid
a
research
team
in
london
makes
sure
that
every
new
case
is
thoroughly
documented
before
assigning
it
to
an
adoption
group
of
to
people
this
group
generally
receives
the
names
of
three
prisoners
from
three
different
political
systems
and
meets
once
a
month
to
work
on
the
cases
until
a
result
is
obtained
the
riverside
adoption
group
dating
back
to
was
the
first
one
established
in
the
today
there
are
more
than
in

all
of
these
are
monitored
by

his
staff
of
workers

their
westside

from

movement
in

he
recalls
from

of

biggest
concern
these
days
is
to
focus
attention
on
the
human
rights
covenants
that
president
carter
has
signed
and
is
planning
to
send
to
the
senate
for
ratification
the
covenants
are
worded
almost
the
same
as
the
united
nations
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
signed
in
december
put
into
treaty
form
explains
hawk
the
articles
will
carry
more
weight
it
very
important
for
governments
to
agree
among
themselves
that
they
should
torture
their
citizens
and
should
give
them
fair
trials
and
should
provide
food
and
housing
and
education
for
their
citizens
amnesty
wants
all
governments
to
ratify
the
treaty
anyone
interest
in
volunteering
some
time
to
this
worthy
organization

at

on
a
recent
afternoon
he
answers
all
questions
thoroughly
and
unhesitatingly
we
do
think
in
terms
of
price
at
all
whatever
we
sell
has
got
to
be
up
to
our
standard
in
quality
material
quality
workmanship
and
quality
of
design
you
see
you
got
to
have
a
point
of
view
in
this
thing
that
all
we
got
is
a
point
of
view
and
we
stick
to
it
what
he
calls
a
point
of
view
others
would
simply
define
as
taste
and
hoving
is
well
qualified
to
have
strong
opinions
in
this
area
at
the
age
of
three
years
after
joining
macy
and
company
he
was
already
a
vice
president
and
merchandising
director
at
that
point
says
hoving
i
realized
that
design
was
going
to
be
a
coming
thing
and
i
really
did
know
much
about
it
so
i
matriculated
at
new
york
university
in
their
arts
department
and
i
took
courses
on
period
furniture
old
silver
historic
textiles
color
and
design
it
took
me
three
years
twice
a
week
at
night
then
of
course
i
could
learn
by
going
into
homes
that
were
beautiful
in
england
and
france
at
museums
wherever
i
was
you
learn
if
you
have
a
basis
and
so
i
advise
anybody
who
comes
into
this
business
to
get
knowledgeable
about
decorative
arts

leaving

steadily
becoming

and
president
of

teller
upon
arriving
at

one
of
the
first
things
he
did
was
to
discontinue
selling
anything
that
did
conform
to
his
esthetic
standards
regardless
of
profit

lists
almost
items
under

with
such
unabashed
luxuries
as

an
unpriced

set
in

tiffany
carries
no

because
according
to
hoving
everything
here
is
real
and
no

because
we
think
they
vulgar
he
adds
i
dropped

i
saw
no
reason
why
tiffany
should
carry

jay
jacobs
restaurant
critic
for
magazine
it
is
a
familiar
scene
to
new
york
restaurateurs
an
visitor
arrives
clutching
a
magazine
turns
to
an
article
and
orders
the
items
that
have
been
underlined
whether
the
magazine
is
current
or
several
years
old
the
chances
are
that
it
is
and
that
the
article
is
a
review
by
jay
jacobs
new
york
restaurant
critic
since
its
monthly
circulation
of
makes
the
most
widely
read
food
publication
in
the
world
but
jacobs
who
is
responsible
for
writing
three
lengthy
reviews
per
issue
is
quick
to
point
out
that
in
spite
of
his
knowledge
of
the
business
and
his
love
of
cooking
he
would
never
consider
opening
a
restaurant
himself
i
think
everybody
born
in
this
century
has
fantasized
about
a
restaurant
but
i
think
it
would
be
insane
he
says
in
a
voice
as
rich
and
mellow
as
vintage
port
one
of
the
great
tragedies
of
the
restaurant
business
is
that
people
who
cook
well
at
home
often
think
that
all
it
takes
if
got
any
interest
in
food
and
the
least
bit
of
talent
you
can
probably
cook
a
better
meal
for
four
people
than
you
ever
get
in
any
restaurant
in
the
world
if
you
want
to
invest
that
kind
of
labor
and
time
and
concentration
but
there
a
huge
gap
between
doing
that
and
serving
anywhere
from
to
people
at
night
all
wanting
different
dishes
it
becomes
a
tremendous
problem
of
strategy
and
logistics
affable
and
very
small
of
stature
jacob
displays
a
wry
wit
while
telling
how
he
began
his
career
as
a
painter
cartoonist
and
illustrator
before
turning
to
writing
in
for
years
he
worked
mainly
for
art
publications
and
he
still
writes
a
bimonthly
column
for
magazine
his
first
book

titled
his

the

the
restaurant
is
an
extremely
humorous
and
entertaining
volume
that
is
notable
for
its
exotic
vocabulary
however
the
book
message
is
not
to
be
taken
lightly
that
restaurant
dining
is
a
complex
game
in
which
the
best
players
can
expect
better
service
better
food
and
the
lasting
affection
of
the
owner
all
the
conventions
of
dining
out
including
who
to

how

among

are
humbling

dines
out
at
least
once
a
day
while
in
the
city
he
visits
restaurants
several
times
before
doing
a
review
always
anonymously
and
generally
accompanied
by
others
my
job
he
says
is
to
find
worthwhile
places
that
our
readers
will
want
to
go
to
the
magazine
policy
is
not
to
do
unfavorable
reviews
if
i
think
a
place
stinks
i
do
go
back
and
i
review
it
most
of
our
readers
are
knowledgeable
about
food
somewhat
affluent
and
when
they
come
into
new
york
they
do
want
to
find
some
taco
house
and
they
do
want
to
know
about
the
bad
places
they
only
in
for
a
few
days
and
they
want
to
hit
the
high
spots
the
daily
press
have
a
different
readership
and
a
different
function
when
they
do
a
favorable
review
it
can
damage
a
restaurant
in
that
it
generates
a
sudden
spurt
of
interest
that
the
restaurant
ca
handle
the
father
of
four
boys
jacobs
is
a
very
sociable
person
who
enjoys
throwing
parties
for
to
to
prepare
the
food
he
says
i
lock
myself
in
the
kitchen
for
three
or
four
days
his
reviews
are
so
detailed
that
jacobs
gets
letters
from
readers
across
the
country
who
tell
how
they
have
recreated
a
night
at
the
four
seasons
or
by
analyzing
what
i
have
written
and
approximating
the
dishes
but
what
makes
his
job
particularly
gratifying
is
the
restaurant
people
themselves
i
very
impressed
by
these
restaurant
guys
if
you
travel
in
europe
you
see
them
when
they
years
old
schlepping
suitcases
in
some
motel
and
dreaming
of
the
day
when
they
open
their
own
restaurant
they
usually
come
out
of
small
towns
or
even
villages
and
do
have
the
benefit
of
birth
or
upbringing
or
schooling
and
the
next
thing
you
know
it
years
later
and
they
can
converse
very
adequately
with
henry
kissinger
or
jackie
onassis
or
anyone
else
and
maintain
a
business
and
make
it
work
westsider
raul
julia
star
of
on
broadway
it
nice
to
be
a
vampire
eight
times
a
week
says
raul
julia
the
star
of
at
the
martin
beck
theatre
last
october
he
took
over
the
role
made
famous
by
frank
langella
and
now
julia
pronounced
hoo
lia
by
his
puerto
rican
countrymen
has
developed
a
cult
following
of
his
own
in
this
classic
remake
of
the
broadway
hit
some
critics
have
said
that
the
sets
and
costumes
by
edward
gorey
are
the
centerpieces
of
the
show
more
so
than
any
of
the
performers
but
raul
julia
is
rapidly
becoming
a
local
matinee
idol
drawing
fan
mail
by
the
bagful
and
constantly
meeting
crowds
of
autograph
seekers
outside
the
stage
door
in
his
portrayal
of
count
dracula
raul
takes
on
many
characteristics
of
a
bat
he
hangs
over
the
mantlepiece
at
strange
angles
and
whips
his
dark
cloak
through
the
air
like
a
bat
wings
when
entrapped
by
three
desperate
men
holding
protective
crosses
and
religious
relics
in
front
of
them
he
changes
into
a
bat
and
flies
out
the
window
at
the
stroke
of
dawn
in
the
dressing
room
prior
to
a
performance
without
his
makeup
he
looks
neither
sinister
nor
magnetically
attractive
but
seems
almost
boyish
his
wit
is
matched
by
his
humility
raul
is
aware
that
his
name
is
not
yet
a
household
word
not
many
people
realize
for
example
that
his
natural
speaking
voice
has
the
same
lilting
puerto
rican
accent
heard
everywhere
in
the
streets
and
subways
of
new
york
when
asked
how
he
accounts
for
his
flawless
onstage
pronunciation
raul
shrugs
and
says
with
a
grin
well
that
acting
like
richard
chamberlain
who
in
played
hamlet
with
great
success
on
the
british
stage
julia
is
equally
at
home
in
british
and
american
plays
he
has
starred
in
many
of
joseph
papp
new
york
shakespeare
festival
productions
and
has
received
three
tony
nominations
for
his
dramatic
and
musical
roles
on
broadway
he
sips
a
glass
of
apricot
juice
while
a
makeup
artist
brushes
his
jet
black
hair
straight
back
and
starts
to
darken
his
eyes
removing
his
shoes
raul
tells
all
sorts
of
little
anecdotes
about
his
life
as
the
famous
count
i
usually
eat
very
little
during
the
day
i
go
to
sleep
at
about
five
sometimes
six
maybe
i
getting
a
dracula
schedule
he
says
with
a
laugh
some
people
who
see
the
show
write
and
say
they
going
to
keep
their
windows
open
at
night
dracula
is
a
myth
although
some
people
think
there
actually
are
vampires
bram
stoker
really
created
the
character
of
dracula
taking
legends
from
different
parts
of
the
world
like
the
stories
of
sailors
who
had
been
stricken
by
bats
appearing
on
deck
the
next
morning
all
pale
without
blood
in
them
i
hear
that
bela
lugosi
was
buried
in
a
dracula
costume
i
also
hear
that
boris
karloff
came
to
the
funeral
home
to
visit
him
and
looked
down
at
the
coffin
and
said
not
kidding
are
you
sweetie
dracula
the
character
is
more
than
years
old
julia
the
actor
declines
to
give
his
age
actors
should
be
ageless
he
says
you
see
what
age
does
it
limits
you
to
a
certain
category
he
does
mind
telling
his
height
however
eight
foot
four
he
quips
no
six
two
he
was
in
fact
born
years
ago
in
san
juan
in
after
graduating
from
the
university
there
he
was
performing
in
a
local
nightclub
revue
and
comedian
orson
bean
happened
to
be
in
the
audience
bean
urged
him
to
come
to
new
york
and
introduced
him
to
wynn
handman
of
the
american
place
theatre
although
he
had
not
studied
acting
formally
raul
natural
ability
and
his
versatility
soon
began
to
pay
off
within
two
years
he
was
playing
lead
roles
for
joseph
papp
married
for
the
past
three
years
to
merel
poloway
raul
devotes
a
great
deal
of
his
spare
time
to
a
charitable
organization
called
the
hunger
project
the
purpose
of
the
group
is
to
support
anything
that
will
help
bring
an
end
to
hunger
by
our
goal
is
to
transform
the
atmosphere
that
exists
now
that
says
that
hunger
is
inevitable
all
the
experts
and
scientists
agree
that
we
have
the
means
right
now
to
end
the
starvation
on
the
planet
a
resident
of
the
upper
west
side
for
the
past
years
raul
has
two
major
projects
coming
up
the
title
role
of
othello
for
this
summer
and
a
movie
called
which
he
will
film
in
puerto
rico
this
spring
i
wanted
to
be
in
it
because
it
a
totally
puerto
rican
venture
and
i
want
to
encourage
the
beginning
of
a
quality
movie
industry
raul
appears
to
be
utterly
at
ease
as
he
prepares
to
make
his
stage
entrance
in
the
middle
of
the
first
act
of
i
have
time
for
one
more
question
is
the
acting
life
everything
you
hoped
it
would
be
raul
wraps
the
cloak
around
himself
and
heads
out
of
the
dressing
room
he
looks
back
at
me
and
smiles
yes
he
replies
it
is
eastsider
bob
kane
creator
of
batman
and
robin
at
the
world
fair
in
new
york
a
time
capsule
was
filled
with
memorabilia
thought
to
be
representative
of
american
culture
and
scheduled
to
be
opened
by
historians
years
later
among
the
objects
chosen
was
a
comic
magazine
that
had
appeared
for
the
first
time
that
year
the
creation
of
an
artist
and
writer
named
bob
kane
whoever
chose
the
contents
of
the
time
capsule
must
have
been
prophetic
because
today
years
later
few
characters
in
american
fantasy
or
fiction
are
so
well
known
as
kane
pulp
hero
batman
it
was
a
big
success
from
the
very
beginning
says
the
cartoonist
a
tall
wiry
man
of
whose
tanned
leathery
features
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
those
of
bruce
wayne
batman
secret
identity
superman
started
in
and
the
same
company
comics
was
looking
for
another
superhero
i
happened
to
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
the
first
year
batman
was
more
evil
more
sinister
my
concept
was
for
him
to
scare
the
hell
out
of
the
denizens
of
the
underworld
and
then
the
second
year
i
introduced
robin
because
i
realized
he
would
appeal
to
the
children
audience
that
when
the
strip
really
took
hold
the
walls
of
his
eastside
apartment
are
covered
with
vintage
panels
by
america
most
famous
cartoonists
and
kane
with
his
casual
attire
his
broad
new
york
accent
and
his
habit
of
twirling
his
glasses
around
while
slumped
far
down
in
his
easy
chair
would
not
seem
out
of
place
as
a
character
in
maggie
and
jiggs
yet
he
likes
to
consider
himself
a
serious
artist
and
has
in
fact
had
some
notable
achievements
in
his
second
career
which
began
in
when
he
resigned
from
comics
on
the
heels
of
the
successful
tv
series
i
got
tired
of
working
over
the
drawing
board
after
years
i
wanted
to
be
an
entrepreneur
painter
screenplay
writer
and
producer
since
that
time
he
has
built
up
a
large
body
of
work
oil
paintings
watercolors
pen
and
ink
sketches
and
lithographs
most
of
them
depicting
characters
from
batman
they
have
been
purchased
by
leading
universities
famous
private
collectors
and
new
york
museum
of
modern
art
as
a
writer
kane
has
created
four
animated
cartoon
series
for
television
has
penned
a
screenplay
for
paramount
pictures
silent
has
written
an
autobiography
titled
and
due
to
be
published
next
year
and
has
completed
a
screenplay
for
a
batman
movie
recently
he
has
also
emerged
as
an
active
participant
in
charitable
causes
such
as
unicef
cerebral
palsy
and
the
american
cancer
society
from
march
to
april
the
circle
gallery
at
west
broadway
in
soho
will
exhibit
a
show
of
about
kane
originals
says
kane
with
his
typical
immodesty
i
probably
the
first
cartoonist
to
make
the
transition
to
fine
art
when
you
do
limited
editions
of
lithographs
you
are
definitely
entering
the
world
of
lautrec
and
picasso
and
chagall
kane
has
lived
on
the
east
side
for
the
past
years
and
has
no
plans
to
leave
asked
about
his
early
years
he
tells
of
growing
up
poor
in
the
bronx
i
used
to
draw
on
all
the
sidewalks
and
black
out
the
teeth
of
the
girls
on
the
subway
posters
i
used
to
copy
all
the
comics
as
a
kid
too
that
was
my
school
of
learning
my
greatest
influence
in
creating
batman
was
a
sketch
by
leonardo
da
vinci
of
a
flying
machine
which
i
saw
when
i
was
years
old
it
showed
a
man
on
a
sled
with
huge
bat
wings
attached
to
it
to
me
it
looked
like
a
bat
man
and
that
same
year
i
saw
a
movie
called
mark
of
with
douglas
fairbanks
senior
zorro
fought
for
the
downtrodden
and
he
had
a
cave
in
the
mountainside
and
wore
a
mask
which
gave
me
the
idea
for
dual
identity
and
the
batmobile
as
might
be
expected
kane
takes
much
pride
in
his
lifelong
success
batman
has
influenced
four
decades
of
children
he
declares
it
has
influenced
the
language
it
has
influenced
people
lives
whereby
it
gives
them
a
sense
of
hope
that
the
good
guy
usually
wins
in
the
end
and
mainly
the
influence
has
been
one
of
sheer
entertainment
i
feel
that
most
people
would
like
to
be
a
superhero
to
take
them
out
of
their
dull
mundane
routine
of
everyday
living
my
greatest
thrill
comes
from
my
grandson
little
did
i
know
when
i
was
that
one
day
i
would
see
my
grandson
wearing
a
little
batman
costume
driving
around
in
a
miniature
batmobile
and
yelling
westsider
lenore
kasdorf
star
of
guiding
for
the
pat
few
months
at
least
the
hottest
soap
opera
on
television
has
been
cbs
guiding
which
reaches
approximately
million
viewers
nationwide
the
show
has
regular
characters
and
right
now
the
one
who
is
getting
the
most
attention
is
rita
stapleton
a
beautiful
but
deceitful
nurse
who
recently
brought
up
the
ratings
for
the
week
when
she
was
raped
by
her
on
the
night
before
her
engagement
to
another
man
it
was
all
in
a
day
work
for
westsider
lenore
kasdorf
who
portrays
the
popular
villainess
this
is
definitely
a
job
and
you
get
the
feeling
of
a
schedule
of
punching
in
and
punching
out
of
rolling
it
off
the
presses
but
you
put
in
your
creative
element
too
says
miss
kasdorf
taking
a
break
between
scenes
at
the
studio
with
her
soft
hazel
eyes
pearly
teeth
finely
chiseled
features
and
billowing
brown
hair
she
is
nothing
short
of
stunning
an
impression
that
is
heightened
by
her
throaty
voice
and
by
the
red
sweater
that
covers
her
ample
figure
being
the
star
of
an
soap
means
that
lenore
often
has
to
work
from
to
inside
the
mazelike
studio
so
that
in
winter
an
entire
week
may
go
by
when
she
does
see
sunlight
although
she
receives
a
tremendous
number
of
fan
letters
lenore
does
not
have
time
to
answer
most
of
them
i
not
a
letter
writer
anyway
she
explains
there
are
times
when
someone
is
so
sincere
that
you
feel
you
really
want
to
respond
i
have
had
people
send
me
a
dollar
check
for
postage
my
heart
goes
out
sometimes
i
get
guilty
when
i
read
my
mail
this
audience
is
very
responsive
they
love
to
comment
about
the
show
i
get
a
lot
of
identifying
mail
some
people
say
like
the
sister
i
wish
i
had
sometimes
strange
mail
sometimes
there
lewd
mail
which
is
removed
before
i
can
read
it
she
laughs
vigorously
that
fine
with
me
because
then
i
can
enjoy
all
my
mail
asked
about
which
part
of
the
upper
west
side
she
lives
in
lenore
declines
to
say
i
have
some
fans
who
would
follow
my
footprints
in
the
snow
you
have
to
be
careful
my
husband
and
i
tend
to
stay
in
the
neighborhood
a
lot
and
i
hate
to
ruin
our
indiscreet
little
way
of
getting
around
in
new
york
people
are
used
to
seeing
al
pacino
walking
down
the
street
or
jackie
shopping
at
the
corner
but
out
of
town
at
first
they
not
sure
if
it
you
a
lot
of
people
come
up
to
me
and
say
you
ever
watch
guiding
you
look
so
much
like
that
girl
i
usually
tell
them
who
i
am
i
ca
see
any
point
in
lying
face
it
that
part
of
the
reason
we
doing
this
i
sure
there
a
ham
in
every
actor
whether
they
shy
about
it
or
not
her
husband
actor
phil
peters
recently
won
the
part
of
steven
farrell
on
the
world
another
cbs
soap
opera
within
a
few
weeks
however
there
was
a
change
of
writers
the
new
writers
wanted
to
bring
in
their
own
characters
says
lenore
so
on
the
show
phil
just
disappeared
in
the
night
he
never
showed
up
for
his
wedding
all
the
other
characters
were
saying
could
he
be
she
laughs
at
the
recollection
of
what
happened
soon
afterward
when
she
and
her
husband
were
visiting
fredericksburg
virginia
a
woman
came
up
behind
phil
while
we
were
eating
dinner
and
said
on
you
how
could
you
run
off
on
that
pretty
little
thing
born
years
ago
on
long
island
the
daughter
of
an
army
officer
lenore
grew
up
in
such
diverse
places
as
tennessee
indiana
virginia
germany
and
thailand
after
graduating
from
the
international
school
in
bangkok
she
got
out
of
the
army
and
returned
to
the
to
attend
college
in
indiana
there
she
began
to
do
local
tv
commercials
and
was
so
successful
that
she
decided
to
try
her
luck
in
california
quickly
she
became
an
established
television
actress
winning
roles
in
many
prime
time
series
including
and
and
while
performing
for
a
small
theatre
company
she
met
phil
peters
phil
wanted
to
come
to
new
york
to
work
in
the
theatre
and
with
some
reservations
lenore
came
with
him
although
phil
does
not
have
a
regular
acting
assignment
at
present
lenore
points
out
that
actors
are
never
out
of
work
they
just
between
jobs
guiding
says
lenore
was
originally
a
religious
program
on
the
radio
where
the
moral
of
the
story
was
an
enlightening
lesson
for
everybody
since
moving
to
television
in
the
show
has
changed
considerably
in
content
but
according
to
lenore
it
still
contains
many
lessons
that
are
relevant
to
modern
living
you
can
tell
from
mail
that
you
do
help
people
whether
you
mean
to
or
not
says
the
actress
with
obvious
satisfaction
i
gotten
letters
saying
rita
through
that
difficulty
has
enlightened
me
about
my
own
situation
she
has
not
helped
by
example
because
rita
does
always
do
things
right
but
she
shows
how
much
trouble
you
can
get
into
by
behaving
the
way
she
does
and
in
that
way
i
think
she
helps
people
avoid
the
same
mistakes

years
on

the
curtain

original
and
poignant
drama
about
a
man
fond
memories
of
his
irish
father
won
four
tony
awards
in
including
best
play

the

ably
filled

an
actor
perhaps
best
known
for
playing
uncle
bill
in
the
situation
comedy
one
of
television
most
popular
shows
from
to
recently
he
has
been
seen
in
the
tv
specials
the
and
in
his
long
illustrious
career
the
actor
has
starred
in
four
other
tv
series
and
appeared
in
more
than
motion
pictures
during
the
late
when
he
worked
primarily
on
broadway
keith
rented
an
apartment
on
east
street
with
a
fireplace
and
kitchen
for
a
month
leaving
for
hollywood
in
he
eventually
married
a
hawaiian
actress
and
nine
years
ago
became
a
resident
of
hawaii
i
had
been
to
new
york
for
years
and
years
and
years
and
when
we
came
here
for
a
vacation
last
winter
i
saw
a
play
every
night
for
a
couple
of
weeks
says
keith
was
the
only
one
i
thought
i
really
like
to
do
sometime
not
long
afterward
barnard
hughes
the
tony
award
winning
star
of
decided
to
tour
with
the
show
and
keith
was
offered
a
contract
to
replace
him
delighted
with
the
chance
to
return
to
broadway
in
such
a
compelling
role
after
a
absence
keith
quickly
said
yes
bringing
his
wife
and
children
to
new
york
for
an
extended
visit
he
again
chose
the
upper
east
side
as
a
place
to
live
a
big
brawny
whose
deep
gravelly
voice
and
slothful
mannerisms
somehow
bring
to
mind
a
friendly
trained
bear
keith
normally
spends
the
time
between
his
matinee
and
evening
performances
sleeping
on
an
army
cot
in
his
dressing
room
on
this
particular
day
he
is
sitting
in
the
sparsely
furnished
room
with
his
shirt
off
smoking
a
cigarette
and
answering
questions
about
his
career
his
initially
gruff
demeanor
soon
gives
way
to
laughter
sentiment
hopefulness
and
cynicism
in
equal
measure
a
conversationalist
he
talks
about
the
acting
life
with
a
rare
frankness
taking
over
the
role
of
da
with
only
about
hours
of
rehearsal
says
keith
was
just
a
matter
of
trouping
it
he
did
find
the
task
too
difficult
partly
because
of
his
irish
background
asked
how
far
back
his
ancestry
goes
keith
laughs
and
says
how
far
back
if
you
go
back
far
enough
you
never
stop
i
irish
on
both
sides
on
my
father
side
they
came
over
in
revolutionary
days
on
my
mother
side
five
or
six
generations
it
stays
though
the
first
time
i
went
to
ireland
i
felt
the
whole
deja
vu
thing
i
knew
what
i
see
around
the
next
corner
when
i
walked
he
was
born
in
the
backstage
of
a
theatre
in
bayonne
new
jersey
i
was
there
about
a
week
i
always
getting
letter
from
people
saying
from
bayonne
too
my
parents
were
actors
so
we
went
everywhere
i
went
to
high
school
in
long
island
very
very
nothing
and
i
care
a
damn
thing
about
acting
from
to
he
served
in
the
marine
corps
as
a
sergeant
in
the
pacific
campaign
when
i
got
out
of
the
service
i
was
just
banging
around
looking
for
a
job
i
did
have
an
education
or
anything
a
guy
offered
me
a
part
in
a
play
and
i
did
know
whether
i
ever
get
another
one
but
i
did
so
it
been
very
nice
very
lucky
it
unlike
the
usual
struggle
that
people
go
through
when
the
conversation
lands
on
his
latest
movie
keith
declines
comment
choosing
to
speak
instead
of
last

the
mountain
a
feature
film
that
was
completed
in
july
and
is
scheduled
for
a
easter
release
charlton

and
i
it
about
two
trappers
in
the
west
in
and
what
happens
to
them
when
the
beaver
period
comes
to
a
close
the
two
guys
are
like
sundance
and
butch
but
damn
well
written
it
one
of
the
best
scripts
i
ever
read
heston
kid
wrote
it
he
worked
for
a
couple
of
years
up
around
idaho
and
montana
as
a
river
guide
there
not
a
wasted
word
in
the
script
many
of
his
films
and
tv
shows
keith
has
never
seen
if
it
some
piece
of
junk
i
do
see
why
i
should
bother
it
bad
enough
you
did
it
but
to
live
through
it
again
you
ca
sit
around
and
wait
for
something
you
think
is
of
you
brian
and
his
wife
victoria

children
mimi
his
daughter
from
a
previous
marriage
is
a
member
of
the
pennsylvania

says
keith
with
affection
he
spends
most
of
his
time
raising
the
damn
kids
it
a
job
we
do
a
lot
of
outdoor
stuff
because
in
hawaii
you
can
all
year
round
we
go
on
the
beach
and
camp
out
and
all
that
crap
he
finds
that
being
based
in
hawaii
causes
no
problems
with
his
career
it
does
make
any
difference
where
you
live
keith
growls
softly
people
live
in
london
in
spain
in
switzerland
you
do
go
around
looking
for
jobs
you
wait
till
your
agent
calls
you
and
you
get
on
a
plane
and
go
you
can
be

bayonne
westsider
harold
kennedy
author
of
pickle
no
in
the
early
days
of
harold
kennedy
theatrical
career
he
was
involved
in
a
play
written
by
sinclair
lewis
who
may
have
been
a
great
novelist
but
was
no
playwright
kennedy
was
talking
with
lewis
one
evening
before
the
play
opened
when
a
young
student
approached
the
famous
author
and
politely
asked
for
an
autograph
lewis
took
the
piece
of
paper
the
boy
offered
him
and
wrote
on
it
why
do
you
find
a
hobby
that
is
a
nuisance
to
other
people
he
handed
it
back
unsigned
but
the
boy
got
even
the
play
opened
a
few
nights
later
and
was
a
total
disaster
lewis
was
sitting
gloomily
in
the
dressing
room
after
the
final
curtain
when
a
note
was
to
him
by
an
usher
he
opened
it
and
read
in
his
own
handwriting
why
do
you
find
a
hobby
that
a
nuisance
to
other
people
the
story
is
one
of
dozens
told
in
harold
kennedy
book
pickle
no
published
this
month
by
doubleday
the
book
is
a
fascinating
collection
of
anecdotes
stored
up
by
kennedy
during
his
four
decades
in
the
theatre
as
a
director
actor
and
playwright
on
broadway
and
across
the
country
the
subtitle
of
his
book
is
an
irreverent
theatrical
excursion
from
tallulah
to
travolta
and
he
has
written
chapters
about
his
experiences
with
both
of
these
stars
in
addition
to
orson
welles
charlton
heston
thornton
wilder
gloria
swanson
steve
allen
and
others
who
are
less
well
known
today
but
were
legends
in
their
time
its
book
is
dedicated
to
actress
renee
taylor
who
refused
to
come
on
stage
during
a
play
opening
night
until
she
got
a
pickle
with
her
sandwich
as
she
had
during
the
previews
the
coffee
shop
that
had
provided
those
sandwiches
was
closed
and
the
curtain
was
held
while
a
prop
man
got
in
his
car
and
went
searching
for
the
holy
pickle
it
arrived
seven
minutes
after
the
advertised
curtain
time
and
the
show
went
on
unknown
to
taylor
the
stage
crew
was
so
enraged
by
her
antics
that
they
performed
a
little
ceremony
with
the
pickle
before
giving
it
to
her
gloria
swanson
later
said
poor
miss
taylor
ca
you
see
her
shopping
around
to
every
delicatessen
in
new
york
complaining
that
she
can
never
find
a
pickle
to
match
the
caliber
of
the
one
she
had
in
new
jersey
i
meet
the
author
on
a
recent
evening
at
backstage
on
west
street
the
thing
about
this
book
he
says
is
that
whether
people
know
the
actors
or
not
they
find
the
stories
amusing
you
know
i
never
thought
of
writing
these
stories
down
i
used
to
tell
them
to
other
members
of
the
company
over
drinks
after
the
show
and
everyone
loved
them
but
an
actor
and
i
thought
what
made
them
funny
was
the
way
i
told
them
i
did
know
how
they
look
in
print
a
good
friend
of
mine
finally
convinced
me
to
write
about
a
hundred
pages
and
i
said
if
anyone
wants
it
i
write
the
whole
thing
the
first
publisher
i
sent
it
to
doubleday
accepted
it
those
who
have
seen
portions
of
the
ginger
rogers
chapter
in
a
recent
issue
of
magazine
might
think
the
book
is
malicious
but
this
is
not
the
case
says
kennedy
it
just
tells
what
happened
and
some
people
come
out
better
than
others
the
chapter
begins
it
seems
that
ginger
rogers
never
smiles
it
may
be
that
someone
has
told
her
it
would
crack
her
face
it
may
be
more
likely
that
she
a
lady
devoid
of
one
smidgin
of
one
inch
of
a
sense
of
humor
the
author
describes
her
as
colder
than
anyone
else
i
had
met
totally
unlike
her
screen
self
which
only
goes
to
prove
what
a
good
actress
she
is
he
reveals
rogers
at
her
worst
when
she
attempts
to
make
an
actor
out
of
her
fifth
husband
william
marshall
at
the
expense
of
kennedy
and
everyone
else
in
the
cast
the
couple
were
still
on
their
honeymoon
and
rogers
demanded
that
bill
be
given
the
role
of
her
leading
man
in
book
and
the
results
were
disastrous
detroit
leading
critic
wrote
after
the
opening
the
program
lists
marshall
as
having
been
acquainted
with
many
phases
of
show
business
last
night
he
showed
not
even
a
nodding
acquaintance
with
any
of
them
kennedy
writes
at
the
chapter
end
hopefully
ginger
will
find
another
husband
as
it
turned
out
the
last
one
apparently
worked
out
worse
for
her
than
it
did
for
me
rogers
is
apparently
considering
a
lawsuit
against
the
author
still
very
active
in
the
theatre
at
kennedy
is
undertaking
three
productions
this
summer
in
the
with
maureen
and
donny
most
with
kitty
carlisle
and
book
and
with
lana
turner
he
is
directing
all
three
and
acting
in
two
of
them
two
years
ago
he
directed
john
travolta
for
a
summer
stock
company
that
opened
to
hordes
of
screaming
teenagers
in
skowhegan
maine
whenever
travolta
made
in
entrance
or
an
exit
kennedy
tells
in
the
chapter
titled
john
who
he
caused
such
a
commotion
that
the
play
virtually
came
to
a
halt
john
is
a
darling
he
such
a
lovely
boy
says
the
author
he
kiss
me
full
on
the
lips
when
we
met
and
parted
and
i
say
that
with
no
sense
of
implication
in
the
theatre
we
always
been
relaxed
about
an
expression
of
affection
i
thought
in
night
he
was
a
star
in
the
old
tradition
in
the
tradition
of
tyrone
power
i
could
call
john
intelligent
but
he
own
the
movie
industry
in
two
years
and
he
has
things
in
his
contract
that
no
other
stars
have
had
like
approval
of
the
final
cut
of
the
movie
a
native
of
holyoke
massachusetts
kennedy
worked
his
way
through
dartmouth
college
and
the
yale
school
of
drama
and
came
out
with
a
profit
in
he
moved
to
new
york
he
has
lived
on
the
west
side
ever
since
among
his
close
friends
are
some
of
the
merchants
and
artisans
in
his
area
they
care
about
theatre
and
they
know
we
have
special
problems
he
says
there
mal
the
tailor
on
west
street
for
example
if
i
doing
a
play
and
need
something
right
away
drop
everything
and
take
care
of
me
pickle
no
has
already
received
many
favorable
reviews
and
has
been
partially
reprinted
in
the
york
kennedy
is
planning
to
hit
the
talk
shows
soon
with
some
of
his
leading
ladies
what
seems
to
be
uppermost
in
his
mind
at
the
moment
however
is
whether
ginger
rogers
will
sue
for
libel
i
kind
of
wish
she
would
just
to
get
some
publicity
for
the
book
he
muses
of
course
she
a
fool
if
she
does
because
she
never
win
and
the
people
who
have
heard
of
the
book
will
rush
out
and
get
it
but
i
can
say
one
thing
if
there
a
package
from
ginger
waiting
for
me
in
my
dressing
room
i
going
to
have
it
dumped
in
water
westsider
anna
kisselgoff
dance
critic
for
the
york
it
was
and
as
usual
anna
kisselgoff
was
sitting
before
the
at
the
york
newsroom
putting
the
finishing
touches
on
her
latest
dance
review
she
had
spent
the
morning
doing
research
and
had
arrived
at
the
building
around
noon
to
begin
writing
the
article
directly
on
the
computer
terminal
using
her
notes
taken
the
night
before
at
a
dance
performance
at
that
evening
she
would
be
attending
yet
another
performance
but
for
the
moment
at
least
miss
kisselgoff
had
a
little
time
to
herself
and
when
we
sat
down
to
talk
in
her
cubicle
office
facing
the
relatively
quiet
newsroom
she
seemed
noticeably
relaxed
and
cheerful
notwithstanding
the
pile
of
opened
and
unopened
mail
piled
high
on
her
desk
we
get
no
help
that
the
problem
she
said
in
a
clear
even
voice
with
a
tone
that
recalled
mary
tyler
moore
we
have
one
secretary
for
nine
people
in
the
arts
and
architecture
department
she
terribly
overworked
anne
went
on
sweeping
her
hands
like
an
orchestra
conductor
toward
the
stack
of
mail
you
looking
at
what
left
after
i
thrown
away
half
of
it
i
make
up
the
review
schedule
for
the
week
based
on
these
releases
petite
attractive
and
looking
somewhat
younger
than
her
years
the
effervescent
miss
kisselgoff
soon
got
to
the
root
of
her
problem
this
time
of
year
everybody
wants
to
be
reviewed
the
tragedy
is
that
dancers
wait
until
the
spring
and
then
they
give
their
concert
that
they
have
been
preparing
all
year
and
it
on
the
same
night
that
other
dancers
are
giving
theirs
i
think
it
suicidal
we
have
three
dance
critics
at
the
jack
anderson
and
jennifer
dunning
besides
myself
and
in
the
spring
all
three
of
us
are
working
every
day
and
we
still
ca
keep
up
anna
herself
attends
up
to
nine
performances
a
week
during
the
busy
season
besides
her
regular
pieces
in
the
daily
she
is
responsible
for
a
long
comprehensive
article
in
the
sunday
edition
there
has
been
a
tremendous
increase
in
dance
activity
in
the
past
years
she
explained
in
the
year
after
i
joined
the
paper
i
was
asked
to
do
a
rundown
of
dance
events
and
i
found
there
was
not
a
single
week
in
the
year
that
was
free
from
dance
that
was
the
first
time
it
happened
i
think
the
decade
of
the
had
something
to
do
with
it
that
was
when
choreographers
like
balanchine
and
merce
cunningham
who
used
pure
movement
became
most
popular
the
audience
that
came
to
see
them
was
a
new
audience
that
was
already
comfortable
with
abstraction
they
did
require
story
ballets
one
of
the
problems
with
dance
in
the
past
was
the
people
thought
they
would
be
able
to
understand
it
but
if
you
like
plotless
ballet
you
do
have
to
understand
any
more
than
what
you
see
i
think
marshall
mcluhan
was
right
this
is
the
age
of
television
this
generation
is
used
to
watching
images
without
getting
bored
she
has
no
favorite
dancers
but
her
favorite
choreographers
come
down
to
two
george
balanchine
and
martha
graham
you
do
have
any
young
choreographers
now
who
are
really
the
stature
of
the
old
ones
i
ca
give
a
reason
why
except
that
it
happened
historically
that
the
turned
out
to
be
the
most
creative
period
in
dance
not
just
in
the
united
states
but
in
most
parts
of
the
world
that
when
the
modern
dance
pioneers
became
active
people
like
martha
graham
are
revolutionaries
and
you
just
do
get
them
in
every
generation
this
applies
to
the
other
arts
as
well
who
are
the
great
opera
composers
of
today
and
frankly
are
there
any
tolstoys
born
in
paris
anna
arrived
on
the
upper
west
side
at
the
age
of
one
she
attended
bryn
mawr
college
in
pennsylvania
and
later
spent
four
years
in
paris
as
a
general
reporter
for
several
newspapers
but
otherwise
she
has
been
a
lifelong
westsider
dance
has
always
been
one
of
her
prime
interests
she
studied
ballet
for
years
while
a
child
and
remained
an
avid
fan
long
after
realizing
she
would
not
become
a
professional
dancer
in
the
anna
wrote
an
article
on
a
major
dance
festival
for
the
international
edition
of
the
york
in
paris
this
led
to
similar
assignments
in
october
shortly
after
she
returned
to
manhattan
the
hired
her
to
assist
chief
dance
critic
clive
barnes
she
quickly
found
herself
writing
many
reviews
and
when
barnes
resigned
almost
two
years
ago
kisselgoff
was
named
to
replace
him
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
her
job
anna
pointed
out
is
that
she
is
frequently
approached
by
strangers
at
intermission
i
feel
that
everybody
who
agrees
or
disagrees
with
me
can
do
so
by
mail
i
do
want
to
have
long
discussions
with
people
i
do
know
because
i
think
it
an
invasion
of
my
privacy
as
a
person
the
advantages
however
far
outweigh
the
inconveniences
i
can
even
enjoy
bad
dance
she
quickly
added
that
why
i
very
happy
doing
this
job
the
day
that
i
no
longer
be
interested
in
watching
a
dance
performance
i
think
i
should
quit
and
go
on
to
something
else

he
got

lang
soon
discovered
that
the

pit
was
too
confining
for
a
man
of
his
vision
he
might
have
turned
to
composition

instead
he

switch
to
a

his

is
a

in

family
the

he
admits
was
a
moderately
successful
french
restaurant
for
years
before
he
took
it
over
but
it
needed
spiritual
changes
as
well
as
physical
changes
and
let
me
underline
this
and
it
excellent
food
you
can
not
chew

we
maintain
a
certain
kind
of
formal
informality
which
simply
means
that
anyone
can
come
dressed
any
way
they
want
as
long
as
their
behavior
will
justify
their
white
tie
or
dungarees
i
could
raise
the
prices
by
to
percent
overnight
and
i
would
lose
a
single
customer
but
feel
an
obligation
to
new

city
and
the
restaurant
industry
to
maintain
what
i
call
reasonable
prices

small

a
pastry
shop
in
the
same
building
however
lang
stresses
that
percent
of
our
business
comes
from
consulting
i
always
think
in
terms
of
problems
and
solutions
because
every
restaurant
must
be
designed
to
suit
the
needs
of
a
particular
market
at
alexander
for
example
we
came
up
with
a
restaurant
where
you
could
have
a
reasonably
pleasant
luncheon
for
two
to
four
dollars

the

satisfaction

ponders
for

it
would
be

for

to
say
that
my
biggest

is
to
see
an
idea
of
mine
become
a
three
dimensional
reality
especially
if
it
may
be
a
million
project
but
actually
an
even
bigger
thrill
for
me
is
to
go
to
an
obscure
place
in
the
world
and
see
a
bit
of
improvement
in
people
lives
through
the
effort
of
someone
who
was
my
former
disciple
westsider
ruth
laredo
leading
american
pianist
she
has
frequently
been
called
america
greatest
female
pianist
a
title
which
as
recently
as
the
almost
any
woman
would
have
coveted
but
when
the
year
is
and
the
musician
is
ruth
laredo
this
compliment
brings
a
different
response
i
have
mixed
feelings
about
it
says
miss
laredo
sitting
back
on
the
couch
of
her
west
side
living
room
i
would
really
rather
be
known
as
an
american
pianist
being
female
does
preclude
playing
some
of
the
most
powerful
sounds
on
the
piano
her
words
are
backed
by
accomplishments
in
october
ruth
came
to
the
end
of
a
project
to
record
the
complete
works
for
solo
piano
by
sergei
rachmaninoff
the
late
composer
who
emigrated
to
the
after
the
revolution
of
almost
all
of
his
piano
works
were
composed
before
and
they
rank
among
the
most
technically
difficult
pieces
ever
written
for
the
instrument
laredo
is
the
first
person
in
history
to
record
the
piano
solos
in
their
entirety
columbia
records
will
release
the
final
three
discs
of
the
set
in
early
slender
graceful
and
radiantly
attractive
laredo
is
still
adjusting
to
her
recently
acquired
status
as
a
major
international
artist
for
years
she
was
married
to
the
acclaimed
violinist
jaime
laredo
and
during
most
of
that
time
she
was
known
primarily
as
his
accompanist
shortly
after
their
marriage
broke
up
in
her
career
began
to
soar
that
year
the
first
of
her
rachmaninoff
recordings
was
made
and
it
won
rave
reviews
her
lincoln
center
debut
with
the
new
york
philharmonic
orchestra
in
december
caused
such
a
sensation
that
she
was
quickly
signed
up
to
perform
with
the
boston
philadelphia
national
symphony
cleveland
and
detroit
orchestras
after
years
recalls
ruth
i
was
an
overnight
success
now
at
but
looking
considerably
younger
she
can
look
back
on
four
years
of
unbroken
triumph
following
a
recital
at
alice
tully
hall
in
the
york
reported
that
she
operated
within
a
relatively
narrow
range
from
to
superb
her
talents
have
been
constantly
in
demand
ever
since
across
the
and
canada
during
the
season
she
had
over
concerts
including
tours
of
europe
and
japan
this
season
she
will
perform
in
japan
and
hong
kong
although
her
repertoire
includes
piano
works
spanning
the
last
years
ruth
has
concentrated
largely
on
rachmaninoff
and
scriabin
a
russian
composer
of
the
same
era
she
has
recorded
five
albums
of
piano
solos
it
such
strange
music
if
you
have
heard
it
before
she
says
i
gave
some
concerts
of
scriabin
at
hunter
college
and
talked
about
each
piece
before
playing
it
i
was
kind
of
a
crusader
at
the
time
for
his
music
it
was
very
rewarding
for
me
i
think
people
are
much
more
familiar
with
scriabin
today
than
they
were
years
ago
one
thing
i
love
to
do
is
to
talk
to
the
audience
after
a
concert
a
certain
feeling
of
distance
sometimes
between
the
audience
and
classical
musicians
which
need
not
happen
on
most
days
ruth
practices
at
one
of
her
twin
grand
pianos
from
about
in
the
morning
until
in
the
afternoon
when
her
daughter
jennifer
gets
home
from
school
the
walls
of
the
laredos
living
room
are
covered
with
neatly
framed
fingerpaintings
that
jennifer
created
she
intellectually
brilliant
and
lots
of
fun
i
take
her
to
concerts
with
me
when
it
possible
when
i
gave
a
talk
on
rachmaninoff
to
the
cadets
at
west
point
they
all
called
her
a
native
of
detroit
ruth
began
studying
piano
at
the
age
of
performed
with
the
detroit
symphony
at
and
entered
the
curtis
institute
of
music
in
philadelphia
at
there
she
met
her
future
husband
during
their
years
together
ruth
longed
for
a
solo
career
but
it
somehow
eluded
her
i
played
with
leopold
stokowski
and
the
american
symphony
in
the
she
says
there
was
a
major
concert
i
did
at
carnegie
hall
then
but
nobody
heard
about
it
i
think
that
women
are
being
accepted
on
their
own
merits
today
they
were
given
a
chance
until
recently
ruth
keeps
fit
by
riding
her
bicycle
almost
every
day
she
is
a
fan
of
the
new
york
yankees
i
saw
all
the
world
series
games
and
likes
to
do
photography
when
she
has
the
time
a
westsider
ever
since
she
moved
to
new
york
in
ruth
lists
fiorello
on
broadway
across
from
lincoln
center
as
her
favorite
restaurant
when
she
needs
music
supplies
of
any
kind
she
goes
to
patelson
street
and
avenue
says
ruth
it
a
gathering
place
for
musicians
the
people
who
sell
music
there
are
very
friendly
and
very
knowledgeable
they
sell
records
there
they
sell
my
records
asked
whether
men
might
have
an
inborn
advantage
at
the
piano
ruth
denies
the
suggestion
vigorously
of
course
not
she
replies
i
imagine
why
a
man
should
play
the
piano
better
than
a
woman
at
west
point
the
women
do
everything
the
same
as
the
male
cadets
except
boxing
and
wrestling
women
might
have
smaller
fingers
on
the
average
but
as
far
as
strength
speed
and
dexterity
are
concerned
it
impossible
to
listen
to
a
recording
and
guess
whether
it
was
played
by
a
man
or
a
woman
eastsider
stan
lee
creator
of

and
the
incredible
hulk
with
the
current
rage
over

due
to
last

hit

many
people
will
purchase
a
copy
of
the
comic
for
the
first
time
in
years
and
may
be
disappointed
to
see
how
much
it
has
changed
once
the
largest
selling
comic
book
hero
on
the
market
superman
was
knocked
out
of
first
place
long
ago
by
spiderman
the
creation
of
a
native
new
yorker
named
stan
lee
besides
selling
about
one
million
marvel
comics
each
month
spiderman
appears
as
a
daily
strip
in
some
newspapers
around
the
world
but
even
without
this
giant
success
stan
lee
would
be
rich
and
famous
his
fertile
mind
has
also
given
birth
to
the
incredible

the
fantastic

captain
america
doctor

a

figures
as

branches
out

television
drama
animated
cartoons
hardbound
and
paperback
collections
of
comic
reprints
novels
about
marvel

posters
clothing
and
much
more
most
of
these
products
are
the
work
of
other
companies
that
have
bought
the
rights
but
stan
lee
remains
the
creative
force
behind
the
whole
operation
as
i
discover
during
a
meeting
with
lee
at
the
marvel
headquarters
on
madison
avenue
i
think
the
title
of
publisher
is
just
given
to
me
so
i
can
have
more
prestige
when
i
dealing
with
people
says
lee
in
his
clipped
precise
voice
as
he
stretches
his
feet
onto
the
coffee
table
of
his
brightly
decorated
office
i
a
salaried
employee
of
marvel
your
average
humble
little
guy
trying
to
stay
afloat
in
the
stormy
sea
of
culture
the
company
owns
the
properties
of
course
but
i
have
no
complaints
i
think
i
could
have
as
much
anywhere
else
my
main
interest
is
to
see
that
the
company
itself
does
well
and
makes
as
much
money
as
possible
he
is
an
intense
energetic
man
of
wiry
build
who
dresses
in
a
casual
yet
elegant
manner
as
he
shifts
the
position
of
his
arms
and
legs
on
the
couch
there
is
something
unmistakably
spiderlike
in
the
movements
for
all
his
politeness
he
can
not
mask
the
impression
that
his
mind
is
racing
far
ahead
of
his
rapidly
spoken
words
my
involvement
with
this
company
goes
back
to
about
says
lee
i
was
always
the
editor
the
art
director
the
head
writer
and
the
creative
director
from
the
age
of
in
the
early
i
was
thinking
of
quitting
i
thought
i
was
really
getting
anywhere
my
wife
said
not
give
it
one
last
fling
and
do
the
kind
of
stories
you
want
to
do
so
i
started
bringing
out
the
offbeat
heroes
i
never
dreamt
that
they
would
catch
on
the
way
they
did
he
emphasizes
that
he
did
not
create
the
characters
alone
but
them
with
the
help
of
an
artist
nevertheless
it
was
lee
who
revolutionized
the
comic
book
industry
by
introducing
the
concept
of
what
has
been
termed
the
hero
the
superhero
whose
powers
do
not
preclude
him
from
having
the
same
emotional
troubles
as
the
average
mortal
this
is
what
makes
lee
characters
so
believable
and
so
irresistibly
entertaining
on
television
it
explains
why
cbs
incredible
is
a
hit
and
why
the
same
network
has
filmed
eight
episodes
of
amazing
on
january
from
to
cbs
will
broadcast
the
pilot
for
a
new
series
dr
strange
may
come
back
again
says
lee
it
was
made
into
a
two
hour
television
movie
his
old
spiderman
cartoons
too
are
still
in
syndication
he
claims
to
work
about
hours
a
day
and
a
look
at
his
dizzying
list
of
activities
supports
this
claim
besides
running
the
marvel
headquarters
lee
makes
frequent
trips
to
the
west
coast
to
develop
shows
for
abc
and
cbs
writes
some
cartoons
for
nbc
acts
as
consultant
to

worldwide
few
people
know
manhattan
as
well
as
stan
lee
born
the
son
of
a
dress
cutter
in
washington
heights
he
has
made
the
upper
east
side
his
home
for
the
past
years
i
a
big
walker
he
explains
i
a
fast
walker
i
can
easily
average
a
block
a
minute
so
if
i
want
to
walk
to
greenwich
village
i
give
myself
an
hour
blocks
i
would
know
what
time
to
leave
if
i
took
a
cab
asked
about
new
projects
in
the
works
lee
mentions
that
marvel
is
planning
to
produce
some
motion
pictures
that
will
be
filmed
in
japan
and
i
have
a
contract
to
write
my
autobiography
he
adds
i
was
surprised
and
delighted
that
they
gave
me
five
years
to
do
it
so
i
presume
i
wait
four
years
maybe
in
that
period
something
interesting
will
happen
to
me
eastsider
john
leonard
book
critic
for
the
york
it
as
if
the
job
i
have
were
designed
for
me
says
bearded
bespectacled
john
leonard
lighting
his
fifth
cigarette
of
the
early
afternoon
as
he
sits
relaxed
at
his
eastside
brownstone
talking
about
the
pleasures
and
perils
of
being
one
of
the
york
three
daily
book
critics
like
his
colleagues
christopher
and
anatole
broyard
leonard
writes
two
book
reviews
for
the
each
week
and
is
syndicated
nationally
an
avid
reader
since
childhood
he
now
gets
to
read
anything
and
everything
he
desires
that
the
advantage
the
disadvantage
explains
leonard
is
that
there
are
thousand
books
published
every
year
in
this
country
you
can
never
even
pretend
to
be
comprehensive
you
ca
even
pretend
to
be
adequate
in
your
coverage
whereas
the
will
review
almost
any
play
that
opens
on
or
off
broadway
and
almost
every
concert
and
movie
we
review
maybe
books
a
year
in
the
daily
paper
a
smallish
balding
man
of
who
dresses
purely
for
comfort
and
has
a
calm
refined
speaking
manner
leonard
looks
precisely
like
the
bookworm
he
is
i
get
here
in
this
house
probably
or
books
a
year
mailed
to
me
or
brought
by
messenger
the
luxury
of
this
job
is
that
there
so
much
to
choose
from
that
any
mood
or
interest
or
compulsion
or
desire
to
educate
oneself
or
amuse
oneself
can
be
matched
by
some
book
that
has
come
in
new
books
by
authors
he
says
are
the
first
priority
because
they
earned
reviews
for
service
to
the
literary
culture
over
the
years
he
and
his
two
fellow
critics
divide
up
the
plums
and
divide
up
the
dogs
since
i
did
kissinger
memoirs
the
next
huge
endless
book
that
has
to
be
reviewed
whether
anybody
wants
to
review
it
or
not
will
not
be
reviewed
by
me
somewhere
between
and
serious
first
novels
are
published
in
the
each
year
according
to
leonard
this
is
not
pulp
paperback
westerns
it
does
even
count
science
fiction
or
gothic
or
all
that
i
think
a
special
effort
is
made
by
all
of
us
in
the
reviewing
racket
to
review
first
novels
he
reads
many
authors
first
books
on
the
recommendation
of
trusted
agents
and
publishers
over
the
years
you
decide
who
is
lying
to
you
christopher
was
telling
someone
about
that
the
other
day
he
said
you
can
call
me
as
often
as
you
want
but
i
say
that
you
begin
with
a
hundred
dollars
in
you
bank
account
and
if
it
turns
out
that
you
are
begging
me
to
review
a
book
that
has
no
other
redeeming
virtues
but
the
fact
that
you
have
invested
or
thousand
worth
of
advertising
in
it
and
you
got
too
many
copies
out
in
the
bookstores
that
are
moving
that
bank
account
goes
down
when
you
give
me
a
real
surprise
and
a
pleasure
which
is
what
makes
this
job
worthwhile
the
bank
account
goes
up
but
if
the
bank
account
goes
down
to
zero
it
closed
and
that
right
there
are
people
in
this
town
who
i
wo
take
a
telephone
call
from
but
that
the
exception
apart
from
reading
writing
and
travel
leonard
has
few
interests
by
may
i
can
even
look
healthy
because
i
just
sit
out
in
the
garden
getting
paid
to
read
he
says
with
a
grin
he
and
his
wife
sue
a
schoolteacher
have
three
children
from
previous
marriages
his
son
andrew
will
be
starting
college

leonard
it
was
a
good
way
to
turn
your
brain
to
spam
born
in
washington
he
grew
up
reading
the
instead
of
comics
and
initially
planned
a
career
in
law
booted
out
of
harvard
for
neglecting
his
studies
in
favor
of
the

he
sharpened
his
journalistic
skills
under
william
buckley
at
the
before
completing
college
at
the
university
of
california

following
graduation
he
became

director
of
a

his
first

worked
in
an

then
he
was
invited
to
join
the

stuff
when
i
was
first
here
and
broke
comments
leonard
he
has
owned
his
eastside
house
since
among
the
most
memorable
books
that
leonard
has
helped
to
discover
are
joseph
heller
and
gunter
grass
tin
to
be
able
to
sit
down
one
night
as
i
did
and
to
realize
you
in
the
presence
of
an
extraordinary
talent
with
no
advance
publicity
to
be
able
to
have
a
hole
to
fill
in
the
paper
two
days
later
to
sit
down
and
pull
out
all
your
adjectives
and
get
people
to
buy
the
book
this
is
what
you
live
for
he
sighs
happily
you
only
need
two
or
three
of
those
to
last
a
lifetime
westsider
john
lindsay
international
lawyer
it
was
said
of
john
kennedy
that
he
was
too
young
and
too
active
a
man
to
retire
immediately
after
the
presidency
had
he
lived
to
serve
two
full
terms
he
would
have
been
upon
leaving
office
how
he
might
have
spent
the
remainder
of
his
career
is
difficult
to
guess
but
it
likely
that
he
would
have
ended
up
doing
work
very
similar
to
what
john
lindsay
does
today
a
comparison
between
the
two
men
is
hard
to
escape
both
were
war
heroes
both
rose
to
power
aided
by
their
personal
magnetism
kennedy
to
the
nation
highest
office
at
lindsay
to
the
nation
second
toughest
job
at
both
gave
eloquent
speeches
aimed
for
high
ideals
and
made
controversial
decisions
that
brought
plenty
of
criticism
from
within
their
own
ranks
lindsay
now
an
international
lawyer
has
changed
little
in
appearance
since
he
stepped
down
in
after
eight
years
in
city
hall
the
brown
hair
has
turned
mostly
grey
and
the
lines
in
the
face
are
slightly
more
pronounced
but
when
he
behind
the
desk
of
his
rockefeller
plaza
office
his
lean
immaculately
dressed
frame
resting
comfortably
in
a
huge
leather
swivel
chair
he
still
looks
like
a
man
who
is
very
much
in
charge
he
is
a
partner
in
the
corporate
law
firm
of
webster
and
sheffield
which
he
first
joined
in
this
is
a
firm
of
about
lawyers
he
says
in
a
soft
lyrical
voice
we
general
practice
i
back
into
corporate
law
and
there
a
fair
amount
of
international
work
which
takes
me
abroad
quite
a
bit
largely
representing
american
businesses
overseas
a
lot
of
my
work
is
done
in
french
i
handling
a
complicated
matter
involving
imports
to
this
country
and
a
complex
arrangement
involving
offshore
oil
exploration
and
drilling
real
estate
transactions
the
purchase
of
oil
a
matter
in
australia
municipal
counseling
for
a
city
in
colorado
the
international
situation
is
beneficial
to
new
york
these
days
says
lindsay
because
parts
of
the
western
free
world
have
a
bad
case
of
the
jitters
europeans
particularly
and
also
many
people
in
the
middle
east
feel
that
this
is
a
more
stable
place
to
invest
their
capital
leaning
back
with
his
feet
propped
up
on
another
chair
he
elaborates
on
foreign
affairs
i
think
carter
plane
deal
in
the
middle
east
escalated
tensions
rather
than
reduced
them
it
not
a
foreign
policy
to
sell
arms
in
the
middle
east
i
think
americans
have
an
obligation
to
spell
out
what
our
foreign
policy
is
except
for
a
few
public
speaking
engagements
lindsay
has
devoted
nearly
all
his
attention
this
year
to
the
practice
of
law
i
used
to
spend
a
little
time
with
morning
on
abc
but
i
dropped
it
in
january
because
of
the
pressures
of
this
office
he
says
recently
i
did
a
pilot
for
public
television
it
a
small
documentary
that
shows
cataclysmic
events
in
world
history
mostly
from
world
war
ii
and
at
the
same
time
shows
what
was
going
on
in
america
it
might
be
turned
into
a
series
of
documentaries
because
he
served
four
terms
as
congressman
for
manhattan
silk
stocking
district
lindsay
is
generally
associated
with
the
east
side
but
actually
he
was
born
on
the
west
side
riverside
drive
in
one
month
after
graduating
from
yale
in
he
enlisted
in
the
navy
and
served
for
the
next
three
years
taking
part
in
the
sicily
landing
and
the
invasion
of
the
philippines
on
his
way
to
earning
five
battle
stars
two
years
after
leaving
the
service
he
received
his
law
degree
and
seven
years
after
that
in
his
abilities
impressed
attorney
general
herbert
brownell
so
much
that
he
made
lindsay
his
executive
assistant
in
lindsay
ran
for
congress
and
won
quickly
establishing
himself
as
a
tireless
worker
for
the
rights
of
refugees
lindsay
was
an
early
supporter
of
the
peace
corps
and
a
prominent
member
of
the
council
on
foreign
relations
soon
after
leaving
gracie
mansion
john
and
his
wife
mary
and
their
children
settled
down
on
the
west
side
near
central
park
i
feel
very
strongly
that
the
park
is
for
people
and
not
for
special
interest
groups
he
says
we
introduced
bicycling
on
weekends
and
when
i
retired
from
government
we
had
a
major
plan
to
restore
all
of
central
park
the
reason
he
first
got
involved
in
politics
says
lindsay
was
because
out
in
the
pacific
on
lonely
nights
after
hearing
the
news
of
the
death
of
good
friends
i
made
a
determination
that
one
day
i
was
going
to
try
to
do
something
i
was
determined
that
we
were
going
to
have
war
again
in
regard
to
his
years
as
mayor
lindsay
makes
the
simple
statement
that
i
did
my
best
of
a
very
tough
job
and
i
have
no
regrets
about
it
i
look
ahead
to
the
future
but
what
will
the
future
bring
would
he
consider
running
for
office
again
that
a
tough
question
max
he
replies
i
know
there
a
lot
of
talk
with
some
of
my
friends
about
the
senate
in
i
do
take
that
lightly
right
now
i
not
making
any
plans
to
run
but
you
just
do
know
because
life
does
funny
things
and
i
also
think
there
a
big
vacuum
out
there
now
politics
everywhere

sending
songs
into
outer
space
on
august
when
the
voyager
spacecraft
blasted
off
for
a
trip
beyond
the
solar
system
it
carried
on
its
side
a
unique

player
and
a
single
phonograph
record
included
on
that
record
are
musical
selections
that
the
york
has
called
earth
greatest
hits
if
someday
extraterrestrial
creatures
play
the
record
and
enjoy
it
they
will
be
most
indebted
to
the
man
who
chose
of
the
songs
westsider
alan
lomax
that
alan
advice
should
be
so
highly
respected
by
a
committee
that
spent
eight
weeks
choosing
the
other
songs
is
a
testimonial
to
his
musical
reputation
ever
since
he
became
head
of
the
folk
music
archives
of
the
library
of
congress
at
age
alan
has
devoted
his
life
to
the
preservation
and
study
of
international
folk
music
following
the
footsteps
of
his
late
father
musicologist
john
lomax
alan
has
taken
his
recording
equipment
to
six
continents
in
search
of
the
rapidly
disappearing
musical
treasures
of
the
world
i
finally
caught
up
with
alan
and
met
him
for
an
interview
on
a
friday
evening
at
his
on
west
street
one
room
i
observed
was
lined
wall
to
wall
with
tapes
and
record
albums
another
was
filled
with
music
books
a
third
with
computer
readouts
and
a
fourth
with
movie
films
alan
foremost
interest
right
now
is
cantometrics
the
science
of
song
as
a
measure
of
culture
recently
he
published
a
book
titled
a
method
in
musical
accompanying
the
volume
are
seven
cassette
tapes
the
songs
are
arranged
in
an
order
that
will
teach
the
student
to
interpret
their
general
meaning
without
knowing
the
language
when
you
learn
the
system
you
can
understand
any
music
said
alan
we
analyzed
songs
from
societies
around
the
world
out
of
that
study
has
come
a
map
of
world
music
he
then
showed
me
a
musical
chart
of
europe
the
far
east
and
indian
north
america
thirty
seven
aspects
of
the
music
including
rhythm
volume
and
repetition
had
been
analyzed
by
a
computer
to
make
a
graph
each
aspect
of
the
music
said
alan
stands
for
a
different
social
style
it
like
the
guy
who
says
do
know
anything
about
music
but
i
know
what
i
like
it
means
that
kind
of
music
stands
for
his
background
and
what
he
believes
in
alan
played
a
tape
for
me
containing
a
spanish
folk
song
an
irish
jig
and
a
song
from
nepal
explaining
some
of
the
elements
as
the
music
was
playing
by
the
time
you
heard
two
or
three
tapes
he
said
you
get
used
to
the
world
standards
of
music
in
primitive
societies
he
added
everybody
knows
the
same
things
about
everything
so
being
specific
is
a
bore
and
repetition
is
what
they
like
you
do
impose
your
boring
accuracy
on
everyone
by
the
same
token
primitive
people
find
it
much
easier
to
sing
together
than
for
example
new
yorkers
of
different
backgrounds
in
the
latter
case
said
alan
everybody
starts
singing
at
a
different
tempo
like
six
cats
in
a
bag
but
if
you
take
people
who
live
together
and
work
together
it
like
clouds
rolling
out
of
the
sea
alan
was
not
impressed
with
the
movie
for
about
the
life
of
american
folk
woody
guthrie
during
the
great
depression
the
movie
ends
with
woody
leaving
hollywood
for
new
york
to
perform
in
a
radio
show
the
man
who
hosted
that
show
was
alan
lomax
we
collaborated
on
a
number
of
things
recalled
alan
it
was
an
enormous
pleasure
he
was
the
funniest
man
that
ever
talked
and
he
was
so
quick
that
what
was
wrong
with
the
movie
talking
with
woody
was
like
playing
a
game
of
jai
alai
he
was
a
deeply
passionate
person
and
tremendously
gifted
he
got
up
in
the
morning
and
wrote
pages
before
breakfast
just
to
warm
up
though
alan
can
sing
and
play
the
guitar
he
does
not
regard
himself
as
a
performer
but
rather
as
a
funnel
for
other
musicians
during
the
he
helped
launch
the
careers
of
people
like
burl
ives
and
pete
seeger
by
providing
them
with
songs
and
putting
them
on
the
radio
we
set
out
to
revive
the
american
folk
music
in
and
by
god
we
did
it
said
alan
by
it
was
a
national
movement
alan
spent
the
next
years
of
his
life
in
europe
where
he
produced
a
definitive
collection
of
international
folk
music
then
he
moved
back

energetic
jovial

looking
considerably
younger

alan
has
no
doubts
about
the
lasting
value
of
his
work
i
make
my
living
as
a
very
scientist
he
said
by
using
scientific
methods
i
can
absolutely
refute
the
ideas
of
those

say

that

each

something
for

for

the
mighty
lomax
from
late
it
oldies
night
on
the
radio
the
has
promised
to
play
nothing
but
the
greatest
hits
of

and
sure
enough
here
they

all
of
these
songs
reached
number
one
on

charts
and
they
have
something
else
in
common
all
are
genuine
american
folk
songs
of
unknown
authorship
that
might
have
been
lost
forever
if
they
had
not
been
discovered
and
preserved
by
john

alan
lomax
the
famous
folklorist
team
the
folk
music
explosion
in
america
that
peaked
in
the
early
and
continues
today
owes
more
of
a
debt
to
the
lomaxes
than
to
any

carried

with
a
remarkable
talent
and
energy
he
has
gone
far
beyond
the
simple

schedule
of

writing

university
fathers
and
sons
the
elder
lomax
was
primarily
a
songhunter
his
first
collection
was
published
in
it
contained
such
gems
as
john
henry
shenandoah
and
home
on
the
range
which
he
heard
for
the
first
time
in
the
back
of
a
saloon
in
the
negro
red
light
district
of
san
antonio
alan
was
born
in
texas
in
when
he
was
years
old
his
father
gave
him
an
cylinder
recording
machine
and
the
boy
was
hooked
he
became
a
song
scholar
at
in
that
same
year
his
father
was
put
in
charge
of
the
newly
created
archives
of
american
folk
song
at
the
library
of
congress
in
washington
when
alan
was
he
took
over
as
archives
director
the
team
eventually
provided
more
than
half
of
the
songs
in
the
collection
the
lomaxes
wrote
many
books
together
they
introduced
american
folk
music
into
the
nation
public
schools
and
through
their
radio
programs
in
the
and
europe
made
celebrities
out
of
such
performers
as
burl
ives
pete
seeger
leadbelly
and
woody
guthrie
whereas
john
lomax
was
interested
in
the
music
for
its
own
sake
alan
began
some
time
ago
to
look
for
the
deeper
meaning
or
social
significance
of
folk
songs
in
his
many
trips
around
the
world
he
built
up
a
collection
of
recordings
from
every
continent
and
virtually
every
major
culture
along
with
a
he
developed
his
findings
into
the
new
branch
of
anthropology
known
as
cantometrics
when
the
voyager
spacecraft
left
earth
last
august
for
a
journey
beyond
the
solar
system
it
carried
on
its
side
a
unique
record
player
with
a
specially
made
disk
for
alien
beings
to
hear
and
enjoy
the
disk
contained
musical
selections
which
have
been
named
earth
greatest
hits
of
them
were
chosen
by
alan
lomax
the
following
interview
was
conducted
in
various
rooms
of
alan
office
on
a
friday
evening
in
august
one
room
was
filled
with
recording
equipment
tapes
and
records
another
with
music
books
a
third
with
computer
readouts
and
a
fourth
with
movie
films
lomax
spoke
rapidly
and
found
it
difficult
to
sit
still
he
is
not
a
neat
housekeeper
a
sharp
dresser
or
a
master
of
the
social
graces
he
is
however
a
tireless
worker
who
gives
the
impression
of
being
totally
absorbed
in
his
work
a
large
robust
man
he
will
no
doubt
continue
to
be
a
major
figure
in
the
field
of
international
folk
music
for
years
to
come
question
what
exactly
is
cantometrics
answer
it
means
literally
singing
as
a
measure
of
culture
with
it
a
song
performance
may
be
analyzed
and
related
to
a
culture
pattern
each
aspect
of
music
stands
for
a
different
social
style
by
using
cantometrics
you
get
the
story
of
mankind
in
musical
terms
it
like
the
guy
who
says
i
do
know
anything
about
music
but
i
know
what
i
like
it
means
that
kind
of
music
stands
for
his
background
and
what
he
believes
in
q
how
did
you
develop
this
new
science
a
i
started
this
project
in
we
analyzed
songs
on
a
computer
out
of
that
has
come
a
map
of
world
culture
there
are
big
groups
or
styles
of
music
stone
age
people
have
style
we
found
there
a
similarity
of
patagonian
music
and
siberian
even
though
these
people
live
near
the
opposite
poles
along
with
studying
song
we
have
also
studied
dance
and
conversation
in
the
same
way
from
film
i
probably
have
the
biggest
collection
of
dance
film
in
the
world
feet
maybe
the
new
york
public
library
has
more
but
that
specialized
in
fine
art
q
what
the
purpose
of
cantometrics
how
can
someone
learn
it
a
i
recently
published
a
set
of
seven
cassette
tapes
of
folk
songs
from
all
cultural
levels
around
the
world
in
the
booklet
that
comes
with
it
the
songs
are
broken
down
and
analyzed
so
that
the
student
can
learn
the
cantometrics
system
on
his
own
when
you
learn
the
system
you
can
understand
any
music
even
if
you
do
know
the
language
it
being
sung
in
by
the
time
you
heard
two
or
three
tapes
you
get
used
to
the
world
standard
of
music
cantometrics
measures
things
like
repetition
ornamentation
rhythm
melody
orchestral
arrangement
it
analyzes
music
in
relation
to
social
structure
political
organization
community
solidarity
severity
of
sexual
sanctions
cantometrics
makes
the
music
into
a
geography
q
how
does
american
music
differ
from
that
of
the
world
in
general
a
in
our
culture
for
example
we
did
have
much
repetition
until
rock
and
roll
came
around
and
that
represents
another
influence
as
you
know
we
of
european
background
do
sing
very
well
together
everybody
starts
singing
at
a
different
tempo
like
seven
cats
in
a
bag
but
if
you
take
people
who
live
and
work
together
it
like
clouds
rolling
out
of
the
sea
it
turns
out
that
the
people
with
the
most
repetition
in
their
songs
have
the
most
primitive
cultures
at
least
in
relation
to
their
economic
development
everybody
knows
the
same
thing
about
everything
so
being
specific
is
boring
and
repetition
is
what
they
like
you
do
impose
your
boring
accuracy
on
everyone
q
what
do
you
consider
the
real
beginning
of
the
folk
music
movement
in
america
a
it
all
began
in
texas
in
when
my
father
heard
whoopee
ti
yi
yo
on
the
chisholm
trail
he
was
a
country
boy
he
grew
up
in
texas
and
the
cowboys
drifted
past
he
wrote
the
songs
down
just
for
the
hell
of
it
then
he
got
a
grant
from
harvard
and
found
out
how
important
it
was
he
was
the
first
person
in
the
country
to
use
a
recording
device
in
q
did
you
know
woody
guthrie
very
well
a
know
him
i
made
him
famous
i
had
a
radio
program
when
woody
first
came
to
new
york
i
introduced
him
when
he
first
sang
on
radio
he
stayed
at
my
house
they
offered
him
a
huge
contract
but
he
just
walked
off
and
went
to
oklahoma
he
was
a
deeply
passionate
person
and
tremendously
gifted
first
of
all
he
was
the
funniest
man
that
ever
talked
and
woody
was
so
quick
talking
to
him
was
like
playing
jai
alai
he
got
up
in
the
morning
and
wrote
pages
before
breakfast
just
to
warm
up
and
there
was
always
a
slightly
strange
thing
about
woody
an
itchy
feeling
that
he
had
it
might
have
been
beginning
of
the
disease
which
later
killed
him
q
what
your
connection
with
pete
seeger
a
peter
seeger
is
my
protege
i
gave
him
his
banjo
the
banjo
was
a
dead
issue
and
he
came
to
me
and
asked
what
he
should
do
with
his
life
he
was
a
harvard
hippie
we
got
to
be
colleagues
we
worked
on
the
whole
revival
of
the
american
folk
music
i
taught
him
most
of
his
early
songs
q
were
you
ever
a
performer
yourself
a
yes
i
made
a
few
records
but
i
was
always
more
of
a
funnel
i
regarded
myself
as
a
dredge
dredging
up
the
rich
subsoil
of
american
folk
and
putting
it
back
on
the
developing
music
scene
we
set
out
to
revive
the
american
folk
music
in
and
by
god
we
did
it
by
it
was
a
national
movement
q
what
are
some
other
things
you
done
a
i
did
the
first
oral
history
the
leadbelly
book
and
the
book
on
jelly
roll
morton
the
leadbelly
movie
was
taken
from
that
oral
history
for
jelly
roll
morton
i
transcribed
the
tape
and
made
it
into
a
piece
of
literature
the
story
has
been
bought
for
a
movie
by
the
same
people
who
made
the
woody
guthrie
movie
for
q
have
you
done
a
lot
of
research
outside
the
united
states
a
yes
i
spent
to
in
europe
assembling
all
the
best
material
that
had
been
collected
into
albums
geographically
arranged
then
i
started
thinking
about
what
i
heard
on
albums
not
what
musicians
or
literary
people
heard
but
what
i
heard
then
i
met
some
people
at
the
national
institute
of
mental
health
who
were
interested
in
the
norms
of
healthy
behavior
i
indicated
to
them
that
i
was
that
getting
at
the
behavior
styles
of
the
people
of
the
world
they
gave
me
some
dough
and
i
got
a
staff
together
q
how
was
the
american
folk
music
scene
then
a
i
was
very
shocked
when
i
came
back
to
the
united
states
in
the
musical
scene
at
washington
square
made
me
sick
they
said
alan
those
people
you
talked
to
are
all
dead
i
kind
of
withdrew
from
the
whole
business
later
i
set
up
a
concert
in
carnegie
hall
and
brought
in
the
first
bluegrass
group
and
the
first
gospel
group
to
perform
in
new
york
people
stormed
the
stage
there
were
fistfights
and
everything
well
that
was
the
whole
end
of
people
saying
new
york
was
the
center
of
the
folk
scene
q
what
do
you
think
of
bob
dylan
a
dylan
came
along
in
the
footsteps
of
ramblin
jack
elliott
he
lived
with
woody
for
a
while
and
picked
him
as
his
model
he
absorbed
the
whole
southwestern
style
from
woody
and
the
country
for
the
first
time
fell
for
a
national
american
vocal
style
then
dylan
left
the
scene
and
went
middle
class
after
three
years
he
turned
his
back
on
folk
music
turned
his
back
on
people
i
think
he
did
a
big
disservice
to
the
country
when
he
did
that
the
whole
thing
has
been
to
make
urban
mobile
people
have
a
folk
music
of
their
own
it
not
a
bad
idea
terribly
boring
though
q
do
all
your
projects
lead
to
one
goal
a
i
make
my
living
as
a
very
hardworking
scientist
i
do
that
because
it
was
important
finally
to
take
this
huge
world
that
was
coming
out
of
loudspeakers
and
get
down
to
the
meat
of
it
so
that
it
can
be
used
for
the
betterment
of
our
future
so
that
we
can
keep
all
the
treasures
of
the
past
and
use
them
that
what
i
doing
i
doing
it
in
a
scientific
way
so
that
i
can
absolutely
refute
the
idea
of
those
who
say
that
oklahoma
does
matter
or
that
the
pygmies
might
as
well
be
exterminated
each
of
these
people
we
have
found
has
something
for
the
human
future
and
for
the
human
destiny
eastsider
peter
maas
author
of
and
in
on
the
surface
his
life
could
hardly
be
calmer
peter
maas
gets
up
every
morning
to
have
breakfast
with
his
son
then
heads
for
his
midtown
office
where
he
spends
about
five
hours
at
the
typewriter
he
rarely
goes
out
in
the
evening
and
his
idea
of
fun
is
a
weekend
of
fishing
a
set
of
tennis
or
a
game
of
backgammon
i
do
have
to
live
in
new
york
he
says
when
i
working
on
a
book
i
might
as
well
be
living
in
the
wilds
of
maine
but
in
his
mind
peter
maas
leads
the
life
of
james
bond
and
al
capone
rolled
into
one
i
know
an
awful
lot
of
people
on
both
sides
of
the
law
says
the
author
of
two
nonfiction
about
crime
valachi
and
valachi
the
saga
of
three
generations
of
a
mafia
chieftain
family
was
published
in
following
two
years
of
court
battles
and
rejections
from
publishers
who
felt
that
books
on
the
mafia
had
no
commercial
potential
it
sold
three
million
copies
in
languages
and
paved
the
way
for
an
entire
industry
of
mafia
books
and
movies
revealed
the
rampant
corruption
in
the
new
york
city
police
department
through
the
eyes
of
officer
frank
serpico
then
came
of
the
maas
third
expose
of
the
underbelly
of
american
society
which
like
the
others
was
made
into
a
successful
movie
now
the
author
has
written
his
first
novel
in
published
in
september
by
viking
it
is
a
raw
violent
grimly
humorous
story
of
an
star
for
the
new
york
giants
who
gets
mixed
up
with
organized
crime
while
borrowing
money
for
a
shady
investment
scheme
king
kong
karpstein
the
terrifying
loan
shark
who
dominates
the
book
is
based
on
several
people
whom
maas
had
known
personally
and
the
novel
head
mafia
character
has
much
in
common
with
frank
costello
the
prime
minister
of
the
underworld
who
granted
maas
interviews
shortly
before
his
death
in
the
scenes
of
in
porn
parlors
criminal
hideaways
the
fbi
offices
are
all
described
with
the
same
intense
realism
as
the
characters
the
movie
rights
have
been
sold
for
the
reason
i
wrote
it
explains
maas
sitting
restlessly
at
his
eastside
apartment
on
a
recent
afternoon
was
that
i
did
want
to
wake
up
years
from
now
wondering
what
would
have
happened
if
i
had
written
a
novel
i
also
think
a
writer
has
to
challenge
himself
constantly
i
do
think
he
should
play
a
pat
hand
as
he
talks
on
in
his
breezy
new
york
accent
fidgeting
with
a
gold
matchbox
on
the
antique
table
beside
him
maas
seems
barely
able
to
restrain
himself
from
getting
up
and
pacing
the
room
quite
striking
in
appearance
he
is
a
tall
stocky
man
with
a
thatch
of
silvery
hair
and
eyebrows
like
cotton
batting
a
native
manhattanite
he
was
one
of
the
country
top
investigative
reporters
for
many
years
before
writing
his
first
book
in
the
reason
for
the
title
in
says
maas
is
that
the
events
in
the
novel
could
only
happen
in
america
one
of
the
themes
is
that
nobody
in
the
book
including
the
football
player
and
the
federal
prosecutor
thinks
that
he
doing
anything
wrong
so
that
a
very
profound
kind
of
corruption
like
his
previous
books
in
took
two
years
to
write
the
biggest
difference
that
i
found
he
points
out
was
that
in
nonfiction
all
the
discoveries
and
surprises
are
in
the
research
and
in
fiction
they
all
in
the
writing
when
i
write
nonfiction
about
two
thirds
of
the
time
is
spent
in
research
i
did
do
any
research
for
this
it
was
much
harder
and
it
was
the
only
time
i
had
to
rewrite
the
whole
book
although
maas
claims
that
his
own
life
has
never
been
in
imminent
danger
he
was
touched
by
deep
personal
tragedy
in
when
his
wife
a
highly
talented
named
audrey
gellen
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
their
only
child

maas
speaks
with
pride
of
some
of
his
most
important
stories
in
the
past
an
article
he
wrote
in
led
to
the
release
of
edgar
labat
a
black
convict
in
louisiana
who
had
been
on
death
row
for
years
an
article
about
columnist
igor
cassini
in
resulted
in
cassini
arrest
and
conviction
as
a
secret
agent
for
dominican
strongman
trujillo
the
biggest
story
maas
never
wrote
was
a
book
about
the
shah
of
iran
several
years
ago
he
turned
down
an
offer
of
million
for
the
project
in
order
to
concentrate
on
his
novel
i
always
had
trouble
writing
about
women
he
confesses
when
asked
about
future
books
so
the
main
character
of
my
next
work
will
be
a
woman
it
was
going
to
be
another
novel
but
now
i
run
across
what
i
think
is
a
fantastic
nonfiction
project
which
i
mostly
interested
in
because
the
subject
matter
is
a
woman
so
i
think
i
do
that
first
and
the
novel
afterward
at
least
i
know
what
my
next
two
will

london
family
and
its

years
of
the
century

of
the
most
popular
television
series
ever
filmed
the
first
episode
of
the
series
was
released
in
england
in
and
since
that
time
more
than
one
billion
people
in
countries
have
watched
the
exploits
of
the
bellamy
family
introduced
to
american
public
television
in
won
seven
emmy
awards
including
one
for
best
series
each
year
it
was
shown
if
any
single
performer
could
be
said
to
stand
out
over
all
the
others
that
would
be
jean
marsh
who
received
an
emmy
for
best
actress
for
her
portrayal
of
rose
the
head
parlormaid
but
what
most
of
american
fans
fail
to
realize
is
that
with
her
without
would
be
no
she
the
show
with
another
british
actress
a
new
yorker
on
and
off
for
the
past
two
decades
jean
marsh
now
lives
in
an
apartment
on
manhattan
upper
east
side
it
is
here
that
i
meet
her
to
talk
about
which
returned
to
american
television
in
january
with
segments
eight
of
which
have
never
been
seen
before
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
sometimes
it
drives
me
crazy
that
nobody
ever
speaks
to
me
about
anything
else
says
jean
a
slender
pretty
woman
who
has
the
knack
of
putting
visitors
immediately
at
their
ease
with
her
charm
and
lack
of
pretension
i
start
to
drivel
after
a
while
because
i
tell
how
i
devised
and
how
the
cast
was
chosen
there
is
no
irritation
in
her
voice
only
humor
with
her
lively
eyes
and
childlike
appearance
she
is
reminiscent
of
peter
pan
says
jean
did
spring
my
friend
eileen
atkins
and
i
had
been
talking
about
trying
to
devise
a
television
series
we
thought
we
should
write
something
we
knew
about
about
our
pasts
and
it
became
servants
more
than
anything
else
because
her
father
had
been
a
butler
she
was
showing
me
pictures
of
her
family
one
day
she
had
photographs
of
servants
going
to
a
pub
in
a
bus
so
the
first
thing
we
wrote
about
was
servants
going
on
an
outing
and
later
we
decided
it
would
be
nearly
as
interesting
unless
we
included
the
people
upstairs
jean
herself
was
born
in
a
poor
section
of
london
the
daughter
of
a
laborer
and
a
barmaid
from
her
earliest
years
she
aimed
for
a
show
business
career
as
the
surest
route
out
of
her
social
class
she
began
as
a
dancer
i
could
teach
classical
ballet
or
tap
if
i
wanted
now
and
danced
in
stage
productions
and
films
from
the
age
of
until
she
gave
it
up
at
as
an
actress
she
became
an
instant
success
at
when
she
played
the
role
of
a
cat
opposite
one
of
england
leading
comic
actors
the
play
opened
and
i
stole
the
review
recalls
jean
with
a
grin
it
was
a
regional
theatre
and
they
asked
me
to
stay
in
their
company
it
was
a
peak
of
happiness
in
my
life
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
money
or
boys
or
clothes
or
anything
just
work
her
broadway
debut
took
place
more
than
two
decades
ago
and
over
the
years
she
has
dazzled
british
and
american
audiences
in
an
endless
number
of
plays
and
movies
classical
theatre
is
her
specialty
jean
recently
completed
a
tour
of
american
regional
theatres
with
plays
by
shakespeare
shaw
and
oscar
wilde
regional
theatres
are
usually
more
professional
than
broadway
i
could
do
on
broadway
but
i
can
do
it
on
the
road
and
make
money
she
says
of
her
favorite
shakespearean
play
at
one
performance
i
was
playing
in
britches
and
split
them
and
i
managed
to
make
up
a
rhymed
couplet
somebody
came
backstage
and
said
can
you
split
your
britches
at
exactly
the
same
time
every
night
her
current
project
is
a
film
titled
with
george
scott
i
leave
for
canada
next
week
to
do
the
exteriors
i
going
to
get
crushed
to
death
in
the
snow
i
play
george
wife
my
role
is
over
very
quickly
but
then
i
appear
in
flashback
soon
afterward
it
a
mystery
my
death
makes
him
susceptible
to
phenomena
asked
about
scott
she
says
i
known
him
for
about
years
i
think
he
a
dear
his
image
seems
to
be
spiky
and
alarming
people
say
can
you
get
along
with
him
but
i
think
he
like
a
teddy
bear
he
adorable
rather
shy
too
married
and
divorced
at
an
early
age
jean
now
lives
alone
and
likes
it
she
acquired
her
eastside
apartment
a
year
ago
but
has
been
unable
to
spend
more
than
six
weeks
in
it
so
far
due
to
her
extensive
travel
i
go
out
and
get
the
bread
and
newspaper
in
my
pajamas
she
says
jean
explains
her
amazingly
youthful
appearance
by
saying
i
very
young
in
my
head
i
quite
daft
i
sillier
than
most
people
i
know
i
believe
in
god
and
i
believe
you
should
lead
a
good
life
one
thing
i
one
hundred
percent
for
is
ecology
i
so
anxious
that
we
bequeath
the
next
generation
with
an
ugly
world
i
like
them
to
go
on
the
walks
i
have
had
and
breathe
the
air
i
have
breathed
eastsider
jackie
mason
with
steve
martin
in
jackie
mason
admits
that
the
most
famous
thing
he
ever
did
was
to
be
caught
with
one
of
his
fingers
pointing
upwards
on
the
sullivan
the
most
famous
and
the
least
helpful
he
says
of
the
incident
at
that
time
there
was
a
great
wave
of
excitement
about
my
type
of
character
because
i
was
new
and
fresh
and
different
in
those
days
every
comedian
talked
like
an
american
nobody
talked
like
a
jew
or
a
puerto
rican
or
an
italian
there
was
a
lot
of
heat
to
give
me
my
own
series
but
all
the
offers
were
canceled
after
that
incident
asked
whether
he
actually
did
make
an
obscene
gesture
the
short
stocky
comedian
with
the
broad
new
york
jewish
accent
shakes
his
curly
head
the
truth
is
that
i
did
because
i
would
be
ashamed
to
tell
you
if
i
did
there
nothing
wrong
with
it
today
but
the
truth
is
that
i
was
making
with
my
fingers
i
have
a
very
visual
act
you
know
and
sullivan
got
panicky
because
president
johnson
had
just
cut
into
the
program
and
when
the
camera
came
back
on
me
it
looked
like
i
was
giving
him
some
kind
of
message
the
next
day
i
became
headlines
all
over
the
world
i
maintained
enough
success
and
enough
imagery
to
be
able
to
do
all
the
other
shows
as
a
guest
but
the
sponsors
were
afraid
to
be
associated
with
me
as
the
star
jackie
is
telling
me
this
in
his
dressing
room
at
dangerfield
first
avenue
where
he
performing
six
nights
a
week
until
december
the
affable
mason
is
quick
to
defend
his
caustic
brand
of
ethnic
humor
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
harmful
if
people
do
feel
any
prejudice
it
provides
an
outlet
for
them
to
be
able
to
laugh
at
it
the
people
who
decry
ethnic
humor
are
afraid
of
their
own
prejudice
you
remind
them
of
the
ridiculous
nature
of
prejudice
most
of
the
things
i
say
are
universal
they
about
marriage
about
minorities
about
social
problems
the
issues
of
the
day
he
also
pokes
fun
at
doctors
weathermen
and
every
profession
in
between
then
there
are
his
highly
exaggerated
impressions
of
menachem
begin
jimmy
carter
and
ed
sullivan
he
always
asked
me
to
do
an
impression
of
him
on
his
show
he
found
out
from
me
how
to
do
another
of
his
ploys
is
to
razz
the
audience
members
in
years
he
said
i
only
had
one
incident
where
a
guy
got
mad
and
wanted
to
punch
me
in
the
mouth
thank
god
i
move
very
fast
he
wanted
to
kill
me
obviously
he
did
catch
me
that
why
i
still
here
for
the
interview
born
in
sheboygan
wisconsin
he
was
raised
in
new
york
lower
east
side
from
the
age
of
following
in
the
footsteps
of
three
older
brothers
he
studied
to
become
a
rabbi
to
please
his
father
i
knew
it
was
for
me
i
have
all
license
to
be
a
rabbi
but
i
not
a
rabbi
a
bachelor
and
eastside
resident
he
loves
new
york
because
this
is
a
melting
pot
that
does
really
melt
there
a
pot
but
it
full
of
unmelted
people
dangerfield
he
says
is
the
only
club
in
new
york
where
major
comedians
still
perform
seven
eight
nine
years
ago
there
was
about
clubs
that
played
comedians
there
was
the
copacabana
the
waldorf
astoria
the
latin
quarter
the
plaza
all
those
rooms
were
wiped
out
consequently
jackie
does
a
lot
of
performing
in
such
clubs
as
the
riviera
in
las
vegas
and
the
fontainebleau
in
miami
nowadays
however
more
interested
in
making
movies
his
first
one
directed
by
john
avelson
of
fame
was
a
big
success
without
anybody
seeing
it
his
second
film
is
now
being
heavily
promoted
for
its
december
opening
also
starring
steve
martin
bernadette
peters
and
catlin
adams
it
is
about
a
poor
black
sharecropper
adopted
son
martin
who
leaves
home
and
begins
wandering
on
the
road
until
he
ends
up
at
the
gas
station
of
harry
hartounian
played
by
mason
he
an
uneducated
kid
who
does
know
anything
explains
jackie
he
does
know
how
to
handle
himself
how
to
talk
how
to
act
i
give
him
a
job
at
my
place
and
i
give
him
a
room
he
does
know
what
a
job
is
and
he
does
understand
that
you
get
paid
he
never
saw
money
he
thinks
you
supposed
to
eat
it
he
a
crazy
lost
kid
and
i
play
the
father
figure
on
december
jackie
will
appear
on
the
griffin
with
steve
martin
and
carl
reiner
the
movie
director
jackie
loves
being
a
comedian
because
i
my
own
boss
and
i
do
what
i
like
when
young
comics
say
it
a
hard
business
to
enter
it
because
they
have
no
talent
if
a
young
comic
has
talent
he
more
likely
to
make
a
big
living
than
in
any
business
you
can
think
of
with
comparatively
less
effort
and
more
opportunity
and
greater
longevity
i
never
saw
a
good
comedian
in
this
business
who
has
made
a
comfortable
living
at
it
westsider
malachy
mccourt
actor
and
social
critic
i
never
take
anything
seriously
least
of
all
myself
says
malachy
mccourt
one
of
the
wittiest
most
outrageous
irish
personalities
in
new
york
i
find
my
life
is
cyclical
and
so
i
move
every
five
or
six
years
from
one
interest
to
another
now
that
i
doing
acting
sort
of
i
thoroughly
enjoy
the
uncertainty
of
it
but
i
do
appear
almost
also
every
wednesday
at
the
unemployment
office
at
street
i
do
a
matinee
from
to
he
concludes
the
remarks
with
his
customary
gust
of
laughter
as
opinionated
as
he
is
entertaining
malachy
mccourt
is
one
of
those
larger
characters
who
has
mastered
the
art
of
conversation
to
such
a
degree
that
no
matter
what
people
think
of
him
they
can
not
help
being
magnetically
attracted
by
his
words
in
he
had
his
own
talk
show
in
that
was
canceled
because
of
the
controversy
it
raised
from
to
he
had
a
weekend
show
on
wmca
radio
and
lost
that
as
well
for
publicly
condemning
the
station
treatment
of
an
employee
whose
job
was
abolished
they
called
him
in
on
a
friday
at
five
minutes
to
five
and
told
him
to
clear
his
desk
he
had
been
there
for
years
the
airwaves
loss
has
been
the
theatre
gain
because
in
the
past
three
years
malachy
has
developed
an
reputation
as
a
character
actor
for
his
roles
in
irish
plays
especially
those
by
john
millington
synge
he
has
also
been
seen
recently
in

explains
malachy

his
broad
breezy
irish
accent

over
and
pacify
the
country
they
could
do
anything
they
pleased
you
could
be
tortured
raped
and
robbed
born
in
limerick
in
malachy
quit
school
at
the
age
of
it
was
an
equal
struggle
they
could
teach
me
and
i
could
learn
he
joined
the
irish
army
at
was
kicked
out
at
then
went
to
england
where
he
worked
as
a
laborer
prior
to
emigrating
to
the
at
the
age
of
his
conversational
brilliance
soon
made
him
famous
as
a
saloon
keeper
at
one
time
he
ran
a
malachy
and
a
malachy
ii
on
the
upper
east
side
i
gave
it
up
he
quips
for
the
sake
of
the
wife
and
the
kidneys
now
the
only
bartending
he
does
is
on
the
abc
soap
opera
where
he
is
a
regular
i
much
prefer
that
it
a
fake
bar
and
everybody
else
cleans
it
up
he
has
few
happy
memories
of
his
native
country
there
should
not
be
a
united
ireland
he
asserts
in
the
south
the
government
is
subject
to
enormous
pressures
by
the
church
all
the
time
in
the
areas
of
birth
control
contraception
abortion
people
should
have
the
rights
to
their
own
bodies
and
their
own
lives
consequently
those
of
us
who
escape
get
very
savage
about
it
very
savage
someone
i
was
talking
to
the
other
day
said
ca
understand
how
you
can
be
an
atheist
and
have
of
fear
of
death
i
said
have
no
fear
of
death
because
i
grew
up
with
it
it
was
all
around
i
woke
up
one
morning
when
i
was
and
a
half
to
find
my
brother
dead
beside
me
another
brother
had
died
six
months
before
my
sister
died
in
her
crib
so
therefore
what
can
you
fear
when
you
know
it
so
well
i
alive
today
i
probably
get
up
tomorrow
there
great
comfort
in
the
fact
that
we
all
going
to
die
eventually
asked
about
daniel
moynihan
whom
he
somewhat
resembles
physically
malachy
describes
the
senator
as
the
nureyev
of
politics
he
can
leap
from
conservative
crag
to
liberal
crag
with
gay
abandon
a
man
who
could
serve
kennedy
and
compare
nixon
to
disraeli
must
be
either
insane
or
insanely
clever
i
look
at
him
and
i
can
not
believe
that
this
overweight
leprechaun
can
be
so
cunning

although
malachy
has
no
desire
to

to

he
recommends

because
it
the
last

an
attitude

in

several
years
up
until
last
fall
meat
loaf
lived
in
peaceful
obscurity
in
an
apartment
at
west
street
few
people
outside
of
his
own
circle
knew
that
the
name
applied
to
a
gargantuan
singer
from
texas
and
the
rock
band
he
headed
a
couple
of
months
ago
meat
returned
to
his
old
neighborhood
after
a
long
absence
this
time
he
caused
a
mob
scene
in
the
local
supermarket
and
on
escaping
to
his
apartment
found
people
climbing
on
the
window
ledges
trying
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
the
reason
his
group
first
album
out
of
which
has
sold
three
million
copies
since
its
release
a
year
ago
i
do
like
to
be
rude
to
fans
says
the
calm
gentlemanly
meat
loaf
his
legal
name
during
an
interview
at
his
new
apartment
in
another
part
of
the
west
side
i
lie
down
on
the
floor
for
hours
so
they
could
see
me
magazine
printed
my
real
name
and
told
more
or
less
where
i
lived
that
why
i
had
to
move
bare
feet
perched
on
the
coffee
table
he
spreads
his
frame
evenly
on
the
living
room
sofa
although
meat
onstage
image
makes
him
out
to
be
one
of
rock
meanest
and
toughest
characters
in
person
he
is
totally
devoid
of
arrogance
and
in
fact
seems
almost
shy
sam

manager
who
arranged
the
recent
trips
to
england
germany
canada
and
australia
helps
the
interview
along
by
adding
his
comments
whenever
meat
begins
to
reach
for
words
all
the
songs
on
out
of
raucous
earthy
and
intense
were
written
by
fellow
westsider
jim
steinman
who
plays
keyboard
with
the
group
after
he
and
meat
loaf
met
in
they
performed
together
frequently
but
their
music
met
with
limited
success
people
were
afraid
of
it
says
meat
the
songs
were
long
the
voices
were
loud
people
in
rock
said
it
was
too
theatre
people
in
theatre
said
it
was
too
rock
and
roll
when
meat
and
jim
were
finally
offered
a
contract
to
do
an
album
steinman
went
to
work
on
some
new
material
and
wrote
nearly
the
entire
contents
of
out
of
in
four
months
including
the
gold
singles
out
of
three
ai
and
by
the
dashboard
a
duet
celebrating
teen
sexuality
that
has
been
choreographed
into
an
show
stopper
by
meat
and
lead
female
vocalist
karla
devito
jim
does
just
write
the
songs
and
hand
them
to
me
i
do
most
of
the
vocal
arrangements
it
really
a
team
it
like
sonny
and
cher
says
the
gargantuan
singer
brought
up
in
dallas
under
the
name
marvin
lee
aday
he
tipped
the
scales
at
while
in
the
fifth
grade
i
was
an
only
child
and
my
parents
always
wanted
two
kids
he
jokes
so
they
set
two
places
at
the
dinner
table
and
i
ate
both
meals
i
was
always
on
the
baseball
team
because
if
they
needed
a
base
runner
they
say
in
there
and
get
hit
by
the
ball
i
back
up
just
enough
so
that
i
would
get
hurt
he
joined
the
high
school
choir
in
order
to
avoid
study
hall
and
from
then
on
singing
became
his
main
passion
after
completing
high
school
at
he
travelled
around
with
a
number
of
bands
by
the
time
he
settled
down
in
new
york
live
rock
music
was
no
longer
in
so
much
demand
as
before
that
one
reason
i
went
into
theatre
he
remarks
another
reason
was
because
someone
hired
me
and
i
did
have
a
job
as
an
singer
and
actor
meat
performed
in
some
broadway
and
off
broadway
productions
including
and
rocky
horror
picture
in
which
he
also
appeared
in
the
film
when
out
of
was
first
released
it
did
not
catch
on
immediately
but
soon
a
couple
of
influential
radio
stations
in
new
york
city
fell
in
love
with
it
then
cleveland
and
boston
began
to
give
it
a
lot
of
air
time
from
there
its
reputation
gathered
momentum
across
the
country
as
a
result
of
the
slow
start
out
of
was
still
climbing
on
the
national
charts
nearly
a
year
after
it
came
out
in
australia
it
was
the
number
one
album
for
straight
weeks
this
past
summer
the
meat
loaf
band
did
four
sellout
concerts
in
the
new
york
area
in
the
space
of
a
month
now
the
band
is
taking
it
easy
for
a
little
while
before
returning
to
the
studio
for
their
second
album
they
plan
to
launch
another
world
tour
after
the

is
completed
in

meat
shares
his
apartment
with
candy
darling
a
slender
pretty
who
will
be
performing
in
an
upcoming
broadway
musical
what
does
meat
loaf
like
about
the
west
side
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
he
replies
i
ca
stand
it
anywhere
else
among
his
preferred
westside
hangouts
gleason
la
cantina
and
anita
chili
parlor
all
on
columbus
avenue
between
and
streets
in
spite
of
his
meteoric
rise
to
fame
meat
loaf
sees
his
overall
career
in
a
different
light
then
his
fans
for
me
he
says
thoughtfully
rock
and
roll
is
not
an
end
i
like
to
make
movies
someday
i
want
to
direct
i
want
to
produce
it
great
to
sell
records
but
this
is
not
what
i
always
want
to
do
it
just
another
step
on
the
mountain
westsider
ann
miller
of
the
rollicking
burlesque
musical
that
rolled
into
broadway
last
fall
was
one
of
the
shows
of
the
year
because
it
signalled
mickey
rooney
return
to
broadway
after
umpteen
years
less
attention
was
initially
given
to
mickey
dazzling
ann
miller
who
last
appeared
on
broadway
in
as
a
star
of
ann
it
turns
out
is
not
only
a
wonderful
singer
and
comedienne
but
in
her
is
still
one
of
the
best
tap
dancers
in
america
her
fancy
footwork
has
become
a
prime
attraction
of
this
smash
i
was
also
in
white
for
a
year
when
i
was
recalls
ann
in
her
dressing
room
after
a
performance
this
is
my
third
show
only
for
most
of
her
career
she
has
lived
in
beverly
hills
california
the
veteran
of
dozens
of
movies
including
the
with
frank
sinatra
miss
miller
is
a
entertainer
who
believes
that
her
career
comes
first
and
foremost
ahead
of
personal
happiness
and
family
married
and
divorced
three
times
she
has
no
children
but
is
an
ardent
animal
lover
i
have
two
beautiful
dogs
cinderella
and
jasmine
she
says
in
a
light
southern
accent
they
look
exactly
alike
only
one
is
hungarian
and
the
other
is
french
my
secretary
walks
them
i
very
much
interested
in
the
protection
of
animals
i
think
people
treat
animals
very
cruelly
and
to
me
when
you
adopt
a
dog
it
like
adopting
a
child
my
little
cinderella
she
was
thrown
out
of
a
car
by
somebody
wanting
to
get
rid
of
her
i
found
her
in
cincinnati
in
a
blizzard
she
almost
died
and
i
saved
her
life
by
looking
beyond
the
heavy
rouge
bright
red
lipstick
large
rhinestone
earrings
and
fluttering
false
eyelashes
that
are
part
of
her
act
one
can
see
that
ann
appears
considerably
younger
then
her
years
she
points
out
is
not
burlesque
in
the
normal
sense
burlesque
got
sleazy
in
the
with
bumps
and
grinds
and
but
that
not
what
we
selling
we
sell
in
a
sense
glorified
vaudeville
with
good
production
numbers
and
that
what
burlesque
was
originally
a
college
professor
got
this
together
the
jokes
are
authentic
our
show
is
for
everybody
it
not
dirty
at
all
not
by
today
standards
there
is
a
crowd
of
people
waiting
to
see
ann
after
nearly
every
show
rooney
escapes
the
fans
by
dashing
out
the
stage
door
within
minutes
of
the
final
curtain
he
lives
way
out
in
new
jersey
explains
ann
who
rents
a
hotel
suite
on
the
upper
west
side
mickey
is
married
and
he
has
children
he
loves
them
all
very
much
mickey
and
i
went
to
school
together
he
a
very
nice
person
and
he
a
great
pro
he
may
be
a
small
man
but
he
a
giant
in
his
own
way
miss
miller
who
likes
to
dine
at
the
club
sardi
and
the
conservatory
believes
that
is
a
hit
because
it
timely
people
are
desperate
to
laugh
they
tired
of
hearing
about
war
and
the
food
crunch
and
the
oil
crunch
they
want
to
be
entertained
she
has
written
her
autobiography
high
which
is
available
only
in
rate
bookstores
and
in
every
library
in
the
country
it
is
out
in
paperback
yet
but
there
some
talk
of
it
asked
about
a
projected
second
volume
on
she
says
it
will
be
my
life
it
will
carry
on
from
where
the
other
one
left
off
she
has
no
secret
for
looking
so
young
except
that
she
is
a
nonsmoker
drinks
nothing
stronger
than
wine
watches
her
diet
and
avoids
anything
strenuous
in
the
daytime
to
save
her
energy
for
the
show
with
her
hair
teeth
and
exaggerated
makeup
ann
looks
more
than
a
little
exotic
this
may
help
to
explain
her
belief
in
reincarnation
i
really
do
have
memories
of
egypt
they
not
in
a
form
that
i
can
describe
you
sometimes
just
know
things
you
born
with
knowing
i
have
been
to
egypt
three
times
and
i
planning
to
go
back
again
and
again
i
want
to
go
mainly
to
luxor
i
very
entranced
with
it
i
like
all
the
antiquities
of
egypt
the
egypt
i
have
no
interest
in
to
speak
of
ann
says
she
does
like
the
name
of
her
current
show
people
think
candy
because
there
is
sugar
babies
candy
she
explains
but
in
the
old
days
babies
meant
beautiful
show
girls
the
girls
had
sugar
daddies
so
they
were
called
sugar
babies
a
texas
native
who
began
dancing
professionally
in
new
york
at
the
age
of
ann
says
yes
she
feels
good
about
her
career
but
that
it
been
a
long
struggle
the
sad
part
is
i
have
wanted
so
much
to
be
happy
but
i
have
never
found
happiness
her
father
who
was
a
lawyer
left
her
mother
when
ann
was
since
miller
was
almost
totally
deaf
ann
supported
them
by
tap
dancing
at
rotary
club
luncheons
she
retains
a
fear
of
poverty
to
this
day
i
save
all
my
clothes
because
some
day
i
might
be
poor
again
she
says
i
have
a
room
with
nothing
in
it
but
racks
of
clothes
i
cover
them
nicely
and
once
a
year
i
air
them
out
in
case
they
come
back
in
style
westsider
sherrill
milnes
opera
superstar
in
a
career
of
my
size
says
baritone
sherrill
milnes
there
is
no
off
season
i
try
to
hold
myself
to
performances
a
year
not
including
recordings
or
dress
rehearsals
or
private
studies
in
fact
i
think
the
american
opera
singer
ever
in
any
voice
category
we
talking
in
his
spacious
westside
apartment
facing
the
hudson
river
i
can
not
help
observing
that
milnes
a
handsome
man
who
stands
foot
and
weighs
pounds
with
his
dark
hair
combed
straight
back
and
wearing
a
blue
flowered
shirt
looks
very
much
like
a
country
and
western
singer
it
is
his
chest
that
gives
him
away
a
massive
powerful
chest
that
hints
at
the
huge
voice
it
supports
to
deliver
notes
that
are
clearly
audible
throughout
the
largest
opera
houses
in
the
world
over
the
sound
of
a
full
orchestra
and
without
amplification
is
one
of
the
most
physically
demanding
tasks
in
all
the
performing
arts
and
one
of
the
best
paying
only
a
handful
of
singers
take
home
like
milnes
approximately
for
each
night
work
at
he
is
in
the
peak
of
his
career
and
has
been
since
he
made
his
metropolitan
opera
debut
in
december
he
has
sung
in
virtually
all
of
the
world
leading
opera
houses
including
the
paris
opera
the
hamburg
state
opera
and
la
scala
in
milan
asked
what
more
he
can
accomplish
milnes
replies
that
one
hopes
to
become
a
better
artist
all
the
time
but
you
can
only
go
so
fast
if
you
make
family
a
priority
position
which
is
certainly
true
in
this
case
there
are
only
so
many
hours
in
the
day
i
could
be
more
famous
were
i
on
television
more
but
it
takes
time
i
do
want
to
sound
like
he
satisfied
with
his
career
where
he
is
and
he
does
want
to
do
any
more
but
i
have
to
realize
that
my
career
can
no
longer
continue
at
the
same
rate
of
ascendancy
his
current
show
with
the
met
verdi
will
continue
until
this
is
the
first
time
new
york
has
heard
the
original
version
notes
milnes
we
be
doing
it
in
italian
people
said
do
you
do
like
the
real
original
in
french
the
problem
is
five
years
later
where
do
you
find
people
who
know
it
in
french
there
a
practical
set
of
problems
when
worldwide
everybody
know
it
in
italian
i
do
know
if
it
would
have
been
worth
it
for
one
season
planning
is
an
important
aspect
of
any
opera
life
milnes
already
has
his
schedule
set
up
until
the
main
reason
why
italy
has
declined
in
importance
as
a
center
for
opera
says
milnes
is
that
the
country
economic
problems
make
it
impossible
for
the
companies
to
book
singers
years
in
advance
i
think
america
is
now
producing
more
singers
than
italy
and
spain
is
very
high
on
the
list
of
producing
singers
it
is
to
italy
that
milnes
owes
much
of
his
success
we
have
that
phrase
baritone
sometimes
more
generically
baritone
no
question
that
verdi
treated
the
baritone
as
a
special
voice
category
differently
really
than
composers
before
him
he
did
a
lot
of
title
roles
for
the
baritone
voice
and
really
split
the
bass
and
baritone
roles
very
much
widely
known
as
an
unselfish
performer
who
gives
his
time
freely
to
others
milnes
is
chairman
of
the
board
of
affiliated
artists
a
organization
that
arranges
concerts
across
america
for
young
coming
singers
born
on
an
illinois
farm
he
studied
piano
and
violin
from
early
childhood
in
high
school
he
won
the
state
music
contest
in
five
separate
categories
including
vocal
soloist
deciding
that
his
voice
was
the
instrument
that
showed
most
promise
he
began
his
professional
career
as
a
member
of
a
chorus
attached
to
the
chicago
symphony
in
he
turned
to
opera
boris
goldovsky
the
opera
maestro
signed
him
immediately
taught
his
willing
pupil
the
fine
points
of
acting
in
opera
and
took
him
on
five
tours
since
milnes
has
had
practically
no
time
for
anything
but
singing
a
dedicated
family
man
he
is
married
to
soprano
nancy
stokes
the
couple
has
a
son
shawn
and
milnes
has
two
other
children
from
a

he
has
been
a
westsider
for
almost
years
not
at
all
snobbish
about
his
own
musical
gifts
milnes
believes
that
singing
is
excellent
recreation
for
anyone
regardless
of
voice
quality
i
encourage
people
to
sing
in
the
shower
it
a
great
emotional
outlet
even
if
you
lousy
it
makes
you
sound
fantastic
when
i
on
the
stage
i
always
have
that
feeling
that
i
never
going
to
sound
as
good
as
i
do
in
the
shower
you
ca
get
the
same
when
you
singing

westsider
carlos
montoya
master
of
the
flamenco
guitar
carlos
montoya
speaks
two
languages
the
first
is
music
the
other
is
spanish
at
he
is
the
world
most
famous
master
of
flamenco
the
ancient
folk
music
of
the
spanish
gypsies
which
montoya
performs
with
dazzling
speed
and
dexterity
on
october
he
will
give
a
major
concert
at
avery
fisher
hall
with
more
than
albums
to
his
credit
montoya
is
the
most
recorded
flamenco
guitarist
in
history
he
is
thoroughly
committed
to
his
instrument
it
is
not
merely
his
living
but
his
life
he
is
a
pure
gypsy
on
all
four
sides
as
the
spanish
say
maybe
that
explains
why
he
likes
to
tour
from
january
to
may
and
from
october
to
december
every
year
almost
nonstop
across
the
and
canada
to
south
america
europe
and
the
far
east
he
has
been
a
westsider
since
the
and
has
rented
the
same
westside
apartment
since
yet
when
people
ask
montoya
where
he
lives
he
is
likely
to
reply
on
airplanes
an
american
citizen
for
more
than
years
he
is
perhaps
the
first
persons
ever
to
acquire
citizenship
after
answering
no
to
the
question
do
you
like
the
american
form
of
government
because
of
his
poor
english
he
had
misunderstood
the
query
he
corrected
himself
and
that
night
played
for
president
harry
truman
montoya
wife
sally
is
his
steady
helpmate
since
their
marriage
in
she
has
been
his
manager
interpreter
and
best
friend
he
still
speaks
little
english
so
interviews
with
him
are
often
ponderous
three
way
affairs
when
i
arrived
at
the
montoyas
residence
late
one
morning
he
was
very
polite
but
eager
to
get
the
interview
over
with
vamos
he
said
his
demeanor
changed
when
he
discovered
that
i
was
able
to
understand
his
crisp
precise
spanish
when
spoken
slowly
we
quickly
dispensed
with
the
interpreter
does
he
consider
flamenco
to
be
the
highest
art
attainable
on
the
guitar
sitting
upright
in
an
overstuffed
chair
he
smiled
benignly
and
said
not
all
the
flamenco
guitarists
are
artists
there
are
many
guitarists
but
in
the
world
there
are
only
two
or
three
artists
on
the
flamenco
guitar
most
musicians
are
technicians
i
think
that
to
play
flamenco
as
it
should
be
played
you
have
to
be
an
artist
the
music
is
either
very
bad
or
very
good
people
who
hear
the
performance
may
applaud
both
the
technician
and
the
artist
but
afterward
if
the
performer
was
not
an
artist
they
forget
what
they
have
heard
the
smile
remained
on
his
face
and
he
began
to
use
his
hands
with
much
expression
as
he
continued
i
carry
the
music
inside
me
i
want
to
touch
inside
the
heart
of
the
public
that
what
i
always
aim
for
my
music
is
sincere
it
is
very
human
i
believe
it
should
be
listened
to
closely
that
is
why
i
play
concerts
he
was
in
fact
the
first
prominent
flamenco
guitarist
to
go
solo
until
montoya
started
giving
concerts
in
flamenco
was
strictly
a
music
to
accompany
singers
or
dancers
who
added
to
the
rhythm
with
castanets
snapping
fingers
and
feverishly
clicking
heels
when
faced
with
montoya
guitar
alone
the
audiences
did
not
catch
on
immediately
but
as
soon
as
they
learned
to
appreciate
the
full
range
of
his
artistry
his
career
was
assured
many
of
the
sound
effects
produced
by
a
whole
flamenco
group
can
be
duplicated
by
montoya
alone
his
left
hand
can
play
a
melody
and
tap
out
a
rhythm
independent
of
what
the
right
hand
is
going
to
add
to
the
excitement
montoya
never
plays
a
piece
the
same
way
twice
one
reason
is
that
improvisation
is
the
essence
of
flamenco
another
is
that
he
has
never
learned
to
read
music
flamenco
guitar
is
more
popular
than
ever
right
now
said
montoya
young
people
like
it
i
perform
at
a
lot
of
colleges
i
also
perform
with
many
symphony
orchestras
to
play
my
that
composition
which
montoya
and
premiered
in
is
the
first
flamenco
piece
ever
to
be
written
for
a
full
orchestra
the
guitar
sections
appropriately
allow
for
some
improvising
other
works
by
montoya
mainly
his
arrangements
of
gypsy
themes
have
been
transcribed
and
published
for
the
benefit
of
fellow
guitarists
however
as
montoya
pointed
out
the
style
you
can
write
but
all
the
notes
it
is
impossible
so
my
written
works
are
simplified
born
in
madrid
he
took
his
first
guitar
lesson
at
the
age
of
and
by
his
early
teens
was
performing
regularly
in
cafes
he
toured
extensively
until
world
war
ii
broke
out
when
he
more
or
less
settled
in
new
york
in
truth
he
has
never
been
content
to
settle
anywhere
he
spends
several
months
each
year
in
spain
and
when
he
on
tour
said
his
wife
he
gets
restless
staying
around
the
hotel
and
likes
to
visit
all
the
sights
in
the
area
sally
montoya
a

graceful
native
new

who
met
carlos
while
her
father
was
working
for
the
foreign
service
was
once
a
dancer
herself
but
gave
it
up
because
i
obviously
dance
as
well
as
carlos
plays
i
a
casualty
of
his
success
the
couple
has
two
sons
except
for
travel
carlos
montoya
has
few
interests
outside
his
work
music
and
family
that
all
he
said
quietly
to
be
an
artist
you
must
be
a
slave
to
the
instrument
and
to
the
public
to
play
the
guitar
is
a
serious
thing
not
a
game

me
it

ninth
album
when
melba
moore
recently
dropped
out
of
her
role
in
the
broadway
hit
musical
there
was
a
lot
of
speculation
as
to
the
reason
why
some
observers
suggested
that
eartha
kitt
the
biggest
box
office
draw
did
not
like
to
share
the
billing
with
a
performer
of
caliber
melba
herself
has
a
simpler
explanation
seven
months
of
one
show
is
enough
and
she
had
too
many
other
things
to
do
promoting
her
new
album
preparing
for
another
broadway
musical
doing
her
first
lead
role
in
a

going
on
a

appearances
on

of
her

charli

i
could
join
the
olympics
with
all
i
do
says
melba
one
afternoon
at
the
comfortable
midtown
office
that
is
used
as
the
nerve
center
for
her
multiple
activities
she
is
dressed
in
a
striped
hat
a
white
shirt
and
a
bright
red
necktie
easing
her
slender
form
onto
the
couch
she
looks
smaller
younger
and
more
beautiful
in
person
than
her
photographs
indicate
i
remark
on
her
flashy
necktie
and
melba
using
her
hands
expressively
while
she
speaks
tells
with
amusement
how
she
saw
it
on
the
collar
of
a
salesman
at
fiorucci
and
said
to
him
i
want
that
tie
melba
first
professional
stage
role
was
in

to
she
rose
up
through
the
chorus
to
win
the
female
lead
i
have
no
stories
she
says
in
her
clear
nearly
accentless
voice
from
i
went
right
into
that
was
the
role
that
earned
her
the
tony
award
for
best
supporting
actress
and
the
new
york
drama
critics
and
drama
desk
awards
melba
was
born
years

her

melba
began
singing
at
the
age
of

music
and
upon
graduation
taking
the
advice
of
her
parents
to
get
some
security
she
taught
school
for
a
year
but
soon
a
burning
desire
to
get
into
show
business
took
hold
of
her
and
she
quit
teaching
ever
since
that
day
she
recalls
even
before
i
got
my
first
singing
job
the
whole
world
looked
better
to
me
it
was
while
working
as
a
studio
singer
that
she
was
given
an
audition
for
and
since
then
her
story
has
been
a
virtually
unbroken
success

summer

cbs
and
an
abc
special
on
the
life
of
abolitionist
harriet
tubman
better
known
for
her
singing
than
her
acting
melba
has
recorded
nine
albums
and
has
received
a
grammy
nomination
her
most
remarkable
vocal
feat
however
was
probably
her
concert
at
the
metropolitan
opera
house
in
december
which
won
her
rave
notices
from
every
music
critic
in
town
in
the
concert
she
performed
everything
from
ballads
to
rock
to
opera
singing
opera
actually
rests

melba

like
doing
vocal
exercises

a
nightclub
or
a
concert
hall

has
demonstrated
her
range

many
of

to
be
one
of
the
judges
in
the

pageant
they
said
there

watching
so
i
made
sure
my
nose
was
powdered
they
worked
us
from

to

but
i
did
manage
to
get
a
little
suntan

brown

past
five
years

charles
huggins
melba
is
overjoyed
to
have
a
child
at
last
we
have
been
waiting
for
her
and
spends
as
much
time
as
she
can
with
her
daughter
a
westsider
off
and
on
for
most
of
her
life
melba
is
fond
of
shopping
at
vim
and
vigor
health
foods
street
near
the
carnegie
recital
hall
then
going
next
door
to
the
merit
farm
store
where
she
buys
her
favorite
junk
food
of
all
her
accomplishments
in
the
last
years
melba
is
perhaps
proudest
of
her
involvement
with
an
international
television
series
for
children
blue
which
is
currently
being
shown
in
countries
i
very
much
into
international
things
says
melba
i
have
appeared
in
some
of
the
segments
but
basically
my
role
is
to
let
people
know
about
it
in
some
way
we
hope
that
the
program
can
help
promote
peace
and
understanding
to
these
children
while
they
still
at
a
vulnerable
age
westsider
michael
moriarty
star
of
returns
to
broadway
in
when
michael
moriarty
rose
to
national
stardom
last
year
with
his
chilling
portrayal
of
ss
officer
dorf
in
the
nbc
miniseries
his
performance
was
witnessed
by
some
million
americans
his
current
vehicle
at
the
playhouse
theatre
on
west
street
plays
to
a
maximum
audience
of
yet
in
the
lead
role
of
micah
bradstreet
a
soldier
from
rural
maine
moriarty
delivers
what
clive
barnes
of
the
york
has
said
is
the
best
performance
so
far
of
his
career
is
a
play
about
the
vietnam
war
and
its
effects
on
those
who
are
forced
to
partake
in
it
set
on
a
strikingly
designed
stage
built
to
resemble
a
devastated
hillside
the
play
demonstrates
how
each
of
the
eight
characters
manages
to
cope
with
his
predicament
in
his
own
way
its
message
is
summed
up
in
the
final
words
of
the
drama
spoken
to
micah
as
he
departs
for
the
he
is
told
to
count
the
living
not
the
dead
one
of
the
main
reasons
i
wanted
to
do
this
play
is
that
it
affirms
life
says
moriarty
in
a
dressing
room
interview
just
before
a
performance
it
does
take
any
specific
political
stance
but
it
does
avoid
any
of
the
horrors
of
war
its
only
stance
is
in
the
end
what
overcomes
the
situation
is
love
and
love
sometimes
shows
itself
in
the
strangest
most
bizarre
ways
he
is
tall
and
solidly
built
looking
somewhat
younger
than
his
years
and
though
his
demeanor
has
an
edge
of
shyness
to
it
penetrating
eyes
reveal
that
much
is
going
on
beneath
the
surface
asked
about
his
personal
views
on
vietnam
the
actor
replies
i
not
an
intellectual
so
i
have
no
specific
feelings
about
it
but
his
conversation
soon
reveals
him
to
be
a
deep
thinker
and
a
wit
besides
whose
remarks
are
tempered
as
much
by
humility
as
by
professional
instinct
whatever
i
could
say
about
the
war
has
been
better
stated
by
david
berry
the
playwright
i
able
to
show
my
emotional
response
to
the
war
through
micah
bradstreet
i
not
trying
to
influence
anyone
in
any
way
in
particular
i
do
think
the
play
tells
the
truth
about
vietnam
so
the
more
information
people
have
the
better
decisions
they
can
make
moriarty
decision
to
become
a
dramatic
actor
can
be
traced
to
his
undergraduate
days
at
dartmouth
college
when
he
was
overwhelmed
by
paul
scofield
performance
in
labor
following
graduation
he
won
a
fulbright
scholarship
to
attend
the
london
academy
of
music
and
dramatic
art
in
after
years
of
perfecting
his
craft
in
theatres
across
america
he
picked
up
the
first
of
his
two
tony
awards
for
his
performances
in
your
way
equally
skilled
at
television
acting
he
is
the
recipient
of
two
emmys
including
one
for
a
detroit
native
of
scandinavian
and
irish
ancestry
moriarty
attends
catholic
mass
regularly
and
finds
much
inspiration
in
the
bible
both
spiritual
and
literary
his
chief
hobby
is
music
he
is
a
polished
who
frequently
performs
in
the
city
leading
nightclubs
between
acting
assignments
asked
whether
he
would
consider
teaming
up
with
octogenarian
blues
singer
alberta
hunter
at
the
cookery
in
greenwich
village
he
replies
with
a
laugh
that
very
heavy
company
i
cook
and
she
sing
he
usually
practices
in
the
morning
i
ramble
over
the
piano
and
play
some
easy
music
it
purely
according
to
my
libido
you
might
call

hey
not
bad
that
for
an
album
title
another
of
his
talents
is
writing
plays
although
hesitant
to
discuss
this
aspect
of
his
career
moriarty
finally
admits
that
one
of
his
plays
was
recently
read
dramatically
at
the
mccarter
theatre
in
princeton
new
jersey
under
the
direction
of
ben
levit
it
was
none
of
my
doing
i
sat
back
and
it
all
happened
before
my
very
eyes
i
was
astonished
and
pleased
and
proud
and
in
no
great
hurry
to
see
it
produced
except
by
this
director
if
he
wants
to
long
a
devotee
of
shakespeare
moriarty
founded
his
own
shakespearean
company
potter
field
in
he
and
his
group
perform
free
each
sunday
in
central
park
near
the
statue
of
sir
walter
scott
weather
permitting
in
response
to
a
question
about
the
west
side
where
he
has
lived
for
the
past
five
years
moriarty
says
that
you
can
walk
one
block
and
encounter
everything
the
world
should
either
be
proud
of
or
ashamed
of
his
favorite
local
restaurants
include
coq
du
vin
on
avenue
and
balloon
at
avenue
and
street
pat
and
i
crack
jokes
about
my
career
as
a
waiter
i
worked
at
off
and
on
for
about
four
years
i
was
terrible
they
kept
me
on
out
of
sheer
compassion
i
guess
i
became
an
endearing
lunkhead
other
goals
none
that
i
care
to
mention
says
moriarty
smiling
softly
all
the
other
ones
are
neurotic
and
i
do
want
to
expose
them
i
done
it
too
often
in
my
neuroses
i
think
i
like
to
do
that
or
this
but
in
my
higher
self
i
have
no
unfulfilled
needs

leroy
neiman
america
greatest
popular
artist
like
norman
rockwell
before
him
leroy
neiman
has
the
distinction
of
being
one
of
the
very
few
american
artists
whose
work
is
familiar
to
practically
everybody
in
the
country
rich
and
poor
black
and
white
urban
and
rural
educated
and
illiterate
this
is
as
far
as
their
similarity
goes
however
rockwell
who
died
in
november
at
the
age
of
was
known
for
his
meticulously
detailed
placid
portraits
of
american
family
life
while
neiman
has
built
his
reputation
on
scenes
composed
of
bold
splashes
of
color
rockwell
career
started
and
ended
at
the
evening
neiman
began
at
and
has
reached
its
zenith
in
an
entirely
new
medium
television
his
televised
mural
of
the
olympic
games
was
seen
by
an
estimated
million
people
one
of
the
most
commercially
successful
artists
in
the
world
leroy
neiman
has
spent
the
last
years
living
and
working
in
a
huge
just
off
central
park
west
his
original
paintings
command
up
to
each
but
the
larger
portion
of
his
work
comes
out
in
the
form
of
serigraphs
silkscreen
prints
a
single
piece
of
silkscreen
art
generally
yields
some
prints
each
of
which
sells
for
about
neiman
style
is
admired
everywhere
his
posters
and
calendars
are
in
japan
several
of
his
painting
are
on
permanent
display
at
the
hermitage
museum
in
leningrad
he
was
the
official
united
states
for
the
last
two
olympics
and
will
be
for
the
games
as
well
although
best
known
for
his
sports
pictures
neiman
is
also
a
renowned
portraitist
who
specializes
in
famous
faces
he
is
attracted
by
drama
and
excitement
of
any
kind
whether
found
in
a
tavern
inhabited
by
the
beautiful
people
in
a
heavyweight
fight
in
a
world
chess
championship
or
as
television
viewers
witnessed
last
january
in
a
super
bowl
neiman
sat
on
the
sidelines
of
that
contest
drawing
pictures
of
the
game
in
progress
using
a
electronic
pen
and
palette
the
pictures
were
then
flashed
onto
the
television
screen
it
painting
with
light
explains
neiman
one
morning
in
his
studio
taking
a
break
from
the
oils
and
acrylics
he
is
working
on
it
gives
you
the
same
sense
of
creation
as
any
other
art
medium
building
and
creating
an
image
of
your
own
that
was
there
when
you
started
the
only
limitation
you
ever
have
in
doing
a
work
of
art
is
yourself
starting
this
month
neiman
work
has
become
a
regular
feature
of
sports
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
each
program
paintings
are
interspersed
with
photographs
of
athletes
to
form
a
moving
collage
of
colors
and
shapes
the
artist
has
been
contracted
to
make
six
or
seven
personal
appearances
on
the
program
over
the
next
year
in
which
he
will
demonstrate
the
art
of
drawing
sports
in
action
neiman
is
a
suave
sophisticated
man
who
loves
his
work
and
loves
to
talk
about
it
dressed
in
a
fancy
suit
with
a
long
thin
cigar
protruding
from
under
his
handlebar
moustache
he
expounds
on
a
score
of
subjects
as
if
he
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
in
the
adjacent
room
the
telephone
rings
almost
unceasingly
it
is
answered
by
his
assistant
who
calls
out
the
message
to
him
more
likely
than
not
it
is
a
request
for
neiman
artistic
services
i
sketch
all
the
time
he
says
a
sketch
is
not
necessarily
a
study
to
me
it
a
record
something
to
consult
with
i
sketch
an
awful
lot
in
public
because
when
i
go
someplace
and
i
get
bored
i
sketch
everybody
forgives
me
for
it
they
think
i
have
an
uncontrollable
desire
to
draw
his
style
says
neiman
came
out
of
nowhere
it
happened
very
suddenly
about
just
before
i
started
with
that
magazine
recently
honored
him
with
an
award
for
being
one
of
the
five
most
important
contributors
in
its
history
during
his
childhood
in
minnesota
recalls
neiman
i
was
always
drawing
pictures
and
getting
special
treatment
at
school
showing
off
copping
out
of
other
things
i
lived
a
couple
of
years
in
england
and
france
since
moving
to
new
york
he
has
been
a
constant

neiman
latest
show
is
an
exhibit
of
approximately
serigraphs
etching
and
drawings
at

graphics
on

part
of
the
proceeds
from
sales
will
go
to
the

i
turn
most
things
down
because
they
not
stimulating
and
inspiring
says
neiman
money
is
enough
stimulus
to
do
something
i
do
like
i
work
very
hard
i
fool
around
a

arnold

great
portrait
photographer
when
the
of
london
decided
to
hire
someone
to
photograph
leading
british
citizens
for
a
show
at
england
national
portrait
gallery
the
venerable
newspaper
caused
something
of
an
uproar
by
choosing
an
american
for
the
job
arnold
newman
one
of
the
world
most
important
portrait
photographers
for
the
past
years
the
portraits
whose
subjects
include
sir
lawrence
oliver
sir
john
gielgud
sir
alec
guinness
henry
moore
lord
mountbatten
and
harold
pinter
were
exhibited
last
month
at
the
light
gallery
on
fifth
avenue
and
have
just
opened
in
london
meanwhile
the
book
version
of
the
prints
with
extensive
commentary
has
been
published
this
month
as
great
new
york
graphic
society
boston
the
photographs
like
those
found
in
newman
three
previous
books
and
in
his
hundreds
of
assignments
for
and
other
publications
are
far
more
than
mere
portraits
rather
they
are
profound
artistic
statements
in
which
the
background
of
the
picture
often
symbolizes
the
person
achievement
i
do
use
props
i
use
reality
explains
newman
taking
a
break
at
the
west
street
studio
he
has
occupied
since
on
the
wall
are
pictures
he
prefers
that
word
to
photographs
of
marc
chagall
pablo
picasso
eugene
and
four
american
presidents
newman
has
photographed
every
president
since
truman
big
burly
and
casually
dressed
arnold
newman
at
looks
like
an
aging
beatnik
his
quick
wit
and
ready
laugh
mask
a
perfectionism
that
has
characterized
his
work
ever
since
he
turned
to
photography
in
his
ability
to
make
the
camera
see
what
i
saw
showed
itself
almost
at
once
in
he
held
his
first
exhibition
and
sold
his
first
print
to
the
museum
of
modern
art
i
could
have
made
over
the
years
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
money
than
i
have
simply
by
doing
more
commercial
work
and
cashing
in
on
my
reputation
but
that
does
interest
me
he
reflects
puffing
on
his
ever
present
cigar
i
mean
money
interests
me
but
i
just
see
my
life
being
wasted
specializing
in
portraits
of
artists
he
studies
the
work
of
each
subject
intensely
beforehand
so
that
the
essence
of
the
artist
will
be
distilled
into
the
photograph
by
subconscious
as
well
as
conscious
effort
on
the
side
he
does
enough
commercial
work
to
support
his
own
artistic
efforts
but
over
the
years
the
two
have
somehow
merged
i
forever
being
commissioned
for
things
i
give
my
eye
teeth
to
do
and
paid
very
well
for
it
recently
i
went
out
to
do
a
photograph
strictly
on
my
own
of
somebody
i
admired
and
i
hate
the
picture
yet
the
day
before
i
did
a
picture
for
money
which
i
think
is
one
of
my
best
pictures
in
the
last
three
years
in
he
went
to
washington
to
photograph
senators
for
magazine
including
john
kennedy
then
a
political
unknown
who
was
sometimes
labeled
the
playboy
senator
years
later
recalls
newman
i
was
photographing
president
kennedy
on
the
white
house
lawn
he
turned
to
me
and
said
whatever
happened
to
that
first
picture
you
took
of
me
i
said
president
we
did
senators
and
they
found
out
they
had
one
too
many
for
the
layout
so
they
dropped
the
one
least
likely
to
succeed
and
you
have
to
understand
we
were
surrounded
by
secret
servicemen
and
pierre
salinger
his
press
secretary
was
there
well
i
thought
i
get
a
big
yack
because
kennedy
had
a
marvelous
sense
of
humor
but
instead
his
face
went
rigid
and
i
i
absolutely
turned
ice
cold
the
secret
service
men
turned
around
and
gave
me
a
stupid
can
you
be
look
a
bit
later
i
managed
to
get
into
pierre
office
and
started
stammering
and
apologizing
suddenly
pierre
started
breaking
out
in
laughter
i
said
the
hell
so
funny
he
said
was
pulling
your
leg
he
been
walking
all
around
the
white
house
for
the
last
minutes
telling
that
story
on
himself
after
the
assassination
newman
was
called
to
the
white
house
again
to
photograph
the
official
portrait
of
lyndon
johnson
he
could
give
an
angel
an
ulcer
i
did
get
paid
for
the
picture
not
even
my
expenses
it
cost
me
a
fortune
arnold
and
his
wife
augusta
have
been
married
for
years
she
runs
the
studio
and
works
closely
with
him
their
two
sons
eric
and
david
are
professionals
in
neurology
and
architecture
respectively
the
favorite
neighborhood
restaurants
include
rikyu
and
genghiz
bicycle
on
columbus
avenue
and
the
cafe
des
artistes
on
their
own
block
asked
whether
he
eventually
plans
to
pursue
other
areas
of
photography
besides
portraits
newman
shakes
his
head
the
whole
history
of
painting
was
changed
by
a
man
who
used
the
same
materials
as
everybody
else
did
the
same
brushes
paints
canvas
and
subject
matter
he
explains
so
why
do
we
say
that
cezanne
revolutionized
painting
it
his
ideas
i
deal
with
ideas
too

edwin
newman
journalist
and
novelist
when
you
achieve
a
certain
prominence
on
television
says
edwin
newman
publishers
come
to
you
and
ask
you
to
write
books
then
you
go
round
in
circles
for
a
while
and
finally
say
i
like
to
write
a
book
but
i
do
have
the
time
six
years
ago
the
broadcast
journalist
decided
to
find
out
if
he
was
bluffing
himself
he
spent
seven
months
of
his
spare
time
writing
a
book
called
speaking
will
america
be
the
death
of
english
published
in
when
newman
was
years
old
it
became
the
nation
number
one
for
his
book
civil
was
another
now
edwin
newman
has
written
his
first
novel
houghton
mifflin
published
in
june
it
has
already
gone
through
two
printings
in
hardcover
totaling
copies
the
has
described
the
book
as
a
wodehousian
excursion
that
is
lighter
than
air
and
twice
as
much
fun
as
laughing
gas
in
a
leisurely
interview
at
his
rockefeller
plaza
office
the
author
comes
across
very
much
as
he
does
on
television
his
leathery
features
expand
easily
into
a
smile
as
he
delivers
in
his
slow
concise
foghorn
voice
comments
that
are
as
as
they
are
witty
he
says
is
the
story
of
an
extremely
thin
tall
british
prizefighter
named
aubrey
who
comes
to
the
to
fight
because
he
can
make
more
money
here
than
in
britain
the
more
money
he
makes
the
higher
taxes
he
can
pay
and
aubrey
is
a
great
believer
in
paying
taxes
he
is
tremendously
interested
in
economics
so
that
if
he
is
brought
to
the
microphone
after
a
fight
he
probably
start
talking
about
structural
unemployment
and
floating
exchange
rates
rather
than
talking
about
fighting
the
book
allows
me
to
comment
on
the
united
states
from
the
view
of
an
outsider
his
fascination
with
the
cultural
and
linguistic
differences
of
the
and
england
dates
back
to
the
late
when
newman
left
his
job
with
the
international
news
service
and
moved
to
london
there
he
found
work
as
a
stringer
for
the
nbc
network
and
when
he
was
invited
to
join
the
staff
in
he
remained
at
the
british
capital
for
five
more
years
in
after
serving
as
nbc
bureau
chief
in
both
paris
and
rome
he
returned
to
his
native
manhattan
and
settled
into
his
present
eastside
apartment
with
his
english
wife
rigel
the
newmans
daughter
nancy
was
educated
entirely
in
england
a
harsh
critic
of
the
state
of
the
language
in
america
today
newman
is
the
head
of
the
usage
panel
for
the
american
heritage
dictionary
he
is
always
being
sent
examples
of
poor
english
do
you
want
to
know
what
accountability
is
he
says
his
eyes
crinkling
with
amusement
as
he
takes
a
letter
from
his
desk
this
is
from
a
teachers
committee
in
kalamazoo
michigan
is
a
concept
that
when
operationalized
finds
the
interrelatedness
and
parameters
of
responsibility
shaped
by
individuals
within
the
system
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
movements
going
on
that
affect
language
in
the
united
states
and
it
curious
that
they
would
be
going
on
at
the
same
time
because
in
a
way
they
conflict
with
each
other
one
is
the
increasing
use
of
jargon
and
pomposity
which
can
partly
traced
to
the
size
of
the
government
as
the
government
grows
this
kind
of
language
grows
the
more
technical
they
make
the
language
sound
the
more
money
they
likely
to
earn
then
you
have
the
influence
of
the
social
sciences
where
exactly
the
same
thing
goes
on
people
attempt
to
take
familiar
ideas
small
ideas
and
in
some
cases
no
ideas
and
make
them
sound
large
by
wrapping
them
up
in
grandiose
language
the
other
movement
that
is
going
on
is
based
on
the
notion
that
correct
specific
concrete
language
does
matter
very
much
what
matters
is
that
your
heart
be
in
the
right
place
this
idea
was
thoroughly
welcome
to
many
people
in
education
for
one
thing
it
means
that
you
have
less
written
work
to
correct
and
also
of
course
if
you
do
have
to
teach
correct
english
you
do
have
to
know
it
during
his
years
as
an
nbc
news
correspondent
edwin
newman
has
excelled
in
so
many
areas
that
he
has
become
known
as
the
renaissance
man
one
of
the
most
on
the
air
he
is
frequently
called
upon
to
do
live
instant
specials
of
breaking
news
he
moderated
the
first
debate
in
has
hosted
the
numerous
times
has
covered
six
national
political
conventions
and
reported
from
foreign
countries
each
monday
through
friday
he
is
heard
on
both
radio
and
television
across
the
in
a
series
of
news
briefs
his
biggest
project
at
the
moment
is
a
documentary
on
foreign
policy
which
is
scheduled
to
be
aired
early
in
september
i
think
in
some
way
concludes
newman
i
fell
into
the
right
profession
somebody
said
i
think
it
was
mencken
that
you
go
into
the
news
business
because
it
gives
you
a
seat
and
he

born

larry
commissioner
of
the
national
basketball
association
fame
rests
lightly
on
the
shoulders
of
larry
who
was
raised
on
politics
in
his
hometown
of
springfield
massachusetts
and
never
sought
elective
office
for
himself
yet
became
one
of
the
democratic
party
most
influential
spokesmen
for
nearly
two
decades
as
a
campaign
manager
he
propelled
john
kennedy
into
the
senate
and
then
into
the
white
house
he
served
as
postmaster
general
under
president
johnson
from
to
and
was
twice
named
chairman
of
the
democratic
national
committee
a
post
traditionally
given
to
the
party
foremost
political
strategist
his
name
loomed
large
in
the
watergate
hearings
for
it
was
whose
office
was
broken
into
by
the
original
watergate
burglars
he
was
in
the
news
again
in
when
having
retired
from
politics
he
published
his
autobiography
final
expecting
to
be
out
of
the
public
eye
after
that
was
astonished
to
be
offered
the
job
of
commissioner
of
the
national
basketball
association
now
midway
through
his
fifth
season
he
has
not
only
resolved
the
major
disputes
that
threatened
the
future
of
professional
basketball
but
has
brought
a
new
vitality
to
the
sport
the
nba
headquarters
a
plush
suite
of
office
high
above
fifth
avenue
is
silent
and
practically
empty
on
the
afternoon
of
my
appointment
with
the
commissioner
a
gregarious
host
he
talks
about
basketball
and
politics
for
nearly
two
hours
in
his
effusive
manner
while
cigarettes
he
is
a
hearty
husky
man
with
a
basso
voice
that
rarely
alters
in
pitch
and
is
as
casual
as
a
bartender
brought
up
in
the
town
where
basketball
was
invented
the
son
of
irish
immigrants
he
worked
his
way
through
law
school
by
tending
bar
in
his
father
cafe
in
the
daytime
and
taking
classes
at
night
one
of
the
most
trusted
of
politicians
known
for
his
uncommon
organizational
abilities
and
his
gift
for
compromise
is
a
fascinatingly
conversationalist
who
speaks
with
many
digressions
the
sports
commissioner
is
somewhat
unique
first
of
all
you
are
paid
by
the
owners
and
you
are
expected
to
be
as
responsive
as
you
can
to
the
fans
to
do
everything
possible
to
ensure
that
the
game
is
presented
in
the
best
conceivable
way
to
the
fans
and
the
most
exciting
and
interesting
manner
because
after
all
this
is
business
during
the
kennedy
and
johnson
white
house
years
he
served
as
presidential
liaison
to
congress
and
helped
win
passage
of
the
peace
corps
medicare
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
as
commissioner
his
authority
is
it
goes
to
supervision
of
every
aspect
of
the
game
on
and
off
the
court
he
explains
it
goes
to
determining
even
what
time
games
are
played
and
who
plays
them
attendance
in
the
nba
has
risen
considerably
this
year
cheerfully
attributes
it
to
the
resurgence
of
the
boston
celtics
and
the
improvement
of
the
new
york
knicks
recently
dallas
was
granted
a
franchise
to
create
a
new
nba
team
the
in
the
if
there
were
further
expansion
beyond
teams
predicts
i
think
it
would
take
on
an
international
flavor
there
are
a
number
of
countries
in
europe
that
are
playing
quality
basketball
at
the
professional
level
i
envision
that
by
the
you
would
find
countries
in
europe
that
could
be
competitive
with
us
probably
the
first
step
would
be
only
exhibitions
but
i
can
see
it
reaching
a
point
where
you
could
give
serious
thought
to
establishing
another
conference
perhaps
larry
and
his
wife
elva
have
been
married
since
their
son
laurence
iii
is
a
lawyer
an
eastside
resident
during
most
of
the
last
seven
years
recalls
the
watergate
with
grim
humor
we
did
have
anything
in
the
office
anyway
we
were
practically
bankrupt
i
thought
maybe
there
a
typewriter
missing
i
was
a
disbeliever
it
took
a
long
time
for
it
to
penetrate
that
this
was
real
my
best
recollection
of
that
period
is
that
i
was
very
depressed
in
the
sense
of
what
effects
it
was
having
on
our
system
of
government
when
i
was
on
my
book
promotion
tour
people
would
ask
does
it
feel
to
be
a
politician
as
if
it
was
a
dirty
word
i
have
always
been
proud
of
being
a
politician
and
i
never
felt
otherwise
but
i
found
that
all
of
us
involved
in
politics
were
painted
with
the
same
brush
his
mood
brightens
when
the
subject
returns
to
basketball
speaking
of
the
recent
antics
of
chocolate
thunder
darryl
dawkins
reports
that
the
star
said
that
he
certainly
could
adjust
his
dunk
shot
to
prevent
further
incidents
the
most
difficult
aspect
of
his
job
so
far
says
has
been
to
enforce
the
compensation
agreement
that
players
and
owners
signed
four
years
ago
compensation
means
that
when
a
player
has
terminated
his
contractual
obligations
to
a
club
the
new
club
that
acquires
him
must
make
compensation
to
the
other
team
and
work
that
out
between
them
and
then
if
the
two
teams
fail
to
reach
an
agreement
the
case
comes
to
me
and
i
determine
what
compensation
is
appropriate
in
making
the
losing
club
whole
i
can
assign
draft
choices
players
money
or
any
combination
thereof
it
extremely
difficult
weighing
players
against
players
and
deciding
how
much
money
is
valid
compensation
there
no
sure
way
of
doing
it
unless
you
were
solomon
or
you
had
a
crystal
ball
as
to
how
it
would
turn
out
westsider
maureen
great
lady
of
the
movie
screen
as
recently
as
years
ago
most
of
the
motion
pictures
filmed
in
this
country
had
a
single
run
at
the
theatres
and
then
were
seldom
seen
or
heard
from
again
television
has
changed
that
now
with
longer
broadcasting
hours
and
the
abundance
of
new
channels
vintage
movies
are
enjoying
a
second
life
often
with
a
bigger
audience
than
the
first
time
maybe
that
why
the
name
maureen
is
practically
a
household
word
even
today
between
and
she
made
dozens
of
films
ranging
from
marx
brothers
comedy
day
at
the
to
classics
of
english
literature
and
to
tarzan
films
in
which
she
played
jane
but
unlike
so
many
of
her
contemporaries
maureen
is
neither
dead
nor
retired
she
maintains
a
busy
schedule
of
acting
writing
traveling
and
enjoying
her
status
as
a
mother
of
five
and
a
grandmother
of
many
maureen
shows
me
around
her
large
beautiful
apartment
facing
central
park
right
across
the
hallway
from
basil
rathbone
last
home
i
keep
this
part
for
the
children
she
says
indicating
a
section
of
several
rooms
there
are
photos
of
her
children
everywhere
including
a
good
number
of
her
actress
daughters
mia
and
tisa
farrow
mia
lives
in
england
and
tisa
is
in
california
but
they
still
get
together
frequently
i
doing
an
autobiography
now
it
about
halfway
done
my
agent
has
the
manuscript
but
i
not
writing
any
more
until
i
see
if
there
any
interest
in
it
i
started
it
two
years
ago
then
put
it
away
i
was
even
interested
in
it
myself
then
a
friend
of
mine
john
springer
had
me
to
lunch
he
said
ought
to
do
an
autobiography
i
said
i
had
already
started
one
so
i
went
back
and
worked
on
it
some
more
and
condensed
it
into
pages
i
had
to
do
it
myself
every
word
syllable
comma
she
recently
spent
five
weeks
in
upstate
new
york
playing
one
of
the
leads
in
glass
by
tennessee
williams
the
critics
had
nothing
but
praise
for
her
portrayal
of
the
ambitious
mother
and
one
described
maureen
acting
as
genius
the
stage
is
not
the
only
place
where
maureen
employs
her
dramatic
talents
shortly
after
completing
the
williams
play
she
went
to
albany
new
york
to
do
a
reading
from
wayward
for
the
state
legislature
they
trying
to
get
a
new
bill
through
congress
to
get
money
for
a
program
for
more
halfway
houses
for
women
alcoholics
she
explains
i
believe
in
that
kind
of
thing
one
of
the
last
plays
she
did
in
new
york
city
was
sex
please
we
it
was
a
hit
in
london
and
the
preview
performances
were
doing
well
enough
in
new
york
to
call
for
an
official
broadway
opening
then
drama
critic
clive
barnes
came
to
the
producer
and
said
you
have
an
opening
you
have
a
disaster
because
the
critics
wo
like
it
and
he
was
right
as
soon
as
the
reviews
came
out
the
theatre
emptied
in
the
previews
the
audiences
loved
it
the
critics
made
a
big
thing
out
of
opening
night
in
london
i
do
think
the
public
pays
that
much
attention
to
the
critics
the
average
person
there
does
read
the
reviews
perhaps
it
the
singing
lessons
she
has
never
stopped
taking
that
account
for
her
pure
lyrical
speaking
voice
which
is
still
as
sweet
as
it
was
when
she
made
her
first
film
of
my
nearly
years
ago
though
maureen
soft
british
accent
gives
no
hint
of
it
she
was
brought
up
in
dublin
ireland
while
working
as
a
young
actress
in
england
she
was
discovered
by
an
american
producer
and
brought
to
the
to
do
her
first
movie
with
famed
tenor
john
mccormack
after
that
her
career
blossomed
any
comment
on
the
tarzan
films
for
which
she
became
famous
i
made
five
they
have
been
remembered
i
glad
to
be
remembered
for
something
let
leave
it
at
that
these
days
while
maureen
is
waiting
to
hear
about
her
autobiography
she
is
working
on
some
short
stories
two
have
appeared
in
the
home
i
have
no
special
goals
she
says
one
thing
leads
to
another
supposing
my
theatrical
career
came
to
an
end
i
like
to
open
an
antique
shop
in
vermont
and
write
and
paint
i
always
have
and
sew
if
you
can
do
one
art
you
can
do
them
all
it
different
ways
of
saying
the
same
thing
i
a
special
type
of
grandmother
at
the
theatre
i
like
to
take
the
children
backstage
and
in
new
york
i
take
them
in
a
horse
and
buggy
around
the
park
or
for
tea
at
the
plaza
in
that
way
i
can
bring
color
into
their
lives
maureen
has
been
a
westsider
for
the
past
years
i
very
fond
of
mal
the
tailor
on
near
columbus
and
walsh
the
florist
balloon
the
pioneer
market
they
all
on
street
my
beat
she
walks
toward
the
window
i
love
this
view
the
park
is
different
every
time
of
the
year
now
it
all
covered
with
snow
pretty
soon
the
buds
will
be
all
over
the
trees
she
smiles
contentedly
i
really
think
that
if
i
had
to
leave
the
west
side
i
leave
new
york
because
to
me
this
is
new
york
and
her
westsider
betsy
palmer
star
of
time
next
oh
do
you
take
shorthand
said
betsy
palmer
as
we
sat
down
in
her
dressing
room
to
chat
between
shows
i
could
always
read
and
write
shorthand
i
worked
for
the
b
o
railroad
as
a
stenographer
before
i
went
away
to
school
and
learned
acting
i
guess
if
i
had
to
i
could
brush
up
and
go
back
to
it
it
most
unlikely
that
she
ever
have
to
even
if
her
tony
award
winning
play
time
next
should
happen
to
close
betsy
would
find
herself
swamped
with
offers
for
choice
acting
roles
but
her
hit
show
about
the
lighter
side
of
adultery
wo
be
closing
for
a
long
time
yet
it
is
currently
being
made
into
a
film
starring
ellen
burstyn
and
alan
alda
a
lot
of
people
think
of
me
as
a
personality
rather
than
an
actress
and
when
they
come
to
see
me
they
expect
to
see
that
personality
says
palmer
who
has
one
of
the
more
recognizable
names
and
faces
on
broadway
mostly
people
know
me
from
panel
shows
it
been
a
sword
for
me
when
they
see
me
doing
something
really
dramatic
they
say
god
she
can
act
she
has
made
countless
appearances
on
my
line
and
today
but
to
most
television
viewers
she
is
best
remembered
as
the
bright
beautiful
girl
who
for
years
was
a
panelist
on
got
a
during
her
years
of
tv
stardom
betsy
was
doing
plenty
of
serious
acting
everything
from
shakespeare
to
peter
pan
to
ibsen
she
has
made
five
hollywood
films
and
performed
the
lead
in
numerous
broadway
shows
including
and
tennessee
of
a
few
of
her
roles
however
have
been
as
demanding
as
doris
in
time
next
to
begin
with
she
and
her
monte
markham
are
the
only
characters
in
the
play
second
the
play
action
takes
place
over
a
period
of
years
in
which
doris
goes
through
momentous
changes
in
doing
this
transformation
smoothly
betsy
creates
a
character
so
believable
and
lovable
that
the
audience
forgives
her
for
cheating
on
her
husband
which
she
does
one
weekend
a
year
in
order
to
meet
her
lover
george
doing
the
play
takes
all
my
a
single
woman
now
and
have
been
for
three
years
but
if
i
were
involved
with
somebody
now
it
would
take
up
a
lot
of
my
energies
so
it
does
bother
me
when
the
time
comes
for
me
to
be
involved
i
will
be
right
now
i
really
quite
satisfied
to
come
here
six
days
a
week
and
have
a
fantasy
life
it
has
all
the
good
things
in
it
and
none
of
the
bad
things
it
gives
you
such
a
rainbow
of
colors
to
express
yourself
within
that
i
find
it
terribly
rewarding
and
gratifying
i
am
never
bored
with
the
show
george
like
doris
is
married
and
has
three
children
and
he
too
goes
through
drastic
changes
of
attitude
during
the
time
period
from
to
but
while
george
wins
the
audience
respect
and
sympathy
doris
steals
their
hearts
i
get
out
there
and
i
feel
such
love
all
of
a
sudden
they
begin
to
adore
her
they
watching
her
spread
her
wings
and
finally
fly
the
adultery
is
done
with
such
taste
you
see
two
people
who
really
love
their
respective
mates
and
their
children
in
her
cozy
backstage
room
at
the
brooks
atkinson
theatre
which
is
decorated
with
christmas
lights
betsy
demonstrates
an
overbubbling
friendliness
and
an
extremely
fluent
style
of
speech
an
interview
with
her
is
both
a
pleasure
and
a
challenge
for
she
talks
about
each
subject
with
an
enthusiasm
that
makes
it
hard
for
anyone
to
interrupt
and
go
on
to
the
next
question
her
memories
of
those
panel
shows
you
know
we
used
to
do
right
in
this
theatre
we
must
have
done
it
here
five
six
seven
years
easily
there
are
a
lot
of
guys
here
now
on
the
backstage
crew
who
were
here
with
it
nice
to
be
working
with
them
again
but
i
not
interested
in
the
past
the
past
is
an
illusion
as
is
the
future
betsy
has
been
an
westside
resident
ever
since
she
first
came
to
new
york
in
when
doing
time
next
she
is
subletting
a
friend
apartment
on
riverside
drive
her
daughter
frequently
comes
down
from
connecticut
to
spend
time
with
her
on
the
west
side
i
lived
on
the
east
side
but
my
preference
is
the
west
side
let
face
it
broadway
on
the
west
side
where
broadway
is
is
where
my
heart
is
flowers
by
edith
and
is
one
of
betsy
westside
establishments
i
become
very
good
friends
with
her
gone
to
her
house
to
parties
in
response
to
an
obvious
question
betsy
scolds
gently
never
ask
an
actress
what
she
going
to
do
next
opera
stars
say
know
i
got
this
opera
lined
up
then
this
one
then
this
but
an
actress
does
usually
know
i
just
hope
that
the
next
play
i
able
to
do
will
have
a
lot
of
humanity
in
it
like
this
one
it
not
enough
to
get
a
bunch
of
laughs
you
got
to
be
touched
inside
westsider
jan
peerce
the
man
with
the
golden
voice
in
december
in
a
benefit
concert
at
the
alvin
theatre
about
a
dozen
broadway
stars
of
the
past
and
present
strode
to

sing
some
of
the
songs
they
made
famous
john
raitt
alan

jack

michael

of
enthusiastic
applause
from
the
packed
house
but
when
a
short
stocky
man
with
thick
eyeglasses
and
a
nose
like
jimmy
shuffled
to
center
stage
the
audience
did
merely
cheer
it
erupted
and
when
jan
peerce
finished
his
two
arias
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
give
the
only
encore
of
the
evening
appropriately
enough
his
choice
was
if
i
were
a
rich
man
from
on
the
the
show
in
which
he
made
his
broadway
debut
at
the
age
of
although
peerce
has
been
one
of
america
most
beloved
singers
for
almost
half
a
century
it
was
not
for
sentimental
reasons
alone
that
he
was
treated
with
such
acclaim
that
evening
he
still
has
one
of
the
clearest
strongest
sweetest
tenor
voices
in
the
business
and
his
repertoire
is
enormous
besides
arias
and
showtunes
he
performs
ballads
german
lieder
french
contemporary
songs
cantorial
and
oratory
music
with
equal
facility
in
order
to
keep
his
voice
in
top
form
he
now
limits
his
concerts
to
about
a
year
but
last
summer
on
a
tour
of
australia
he
did
concerts
in
days
i
vocalize
every
day
of
my
life
i
keep
observing
the
laws
of
decent
living
and
i
face
every
booking
as
it
was
my
first
he
says
in
a
recent
telephone
interview
contacted
at
his
westside
apartment
i
believe
in
the
adage
that
the
show
must
go
on
but
you
must
not
go
out
at
the
expense
of
your
health
or
impair
the
quality
of
your
voice
by
singing
against
nature
this
fall
will
find
him
doing
a
show
at
carnegie
hall
in
addition
to
his
regular
schedule
of
concerts

makes
cruises
of
the
caribbean
several
times
each
year
aboard
the
ss
rotterdam
his
parents
were
orthodox
jews
who
had
immigrated
from
russia
and
they
were
able
to
afford
violin
lessons
for
him
by
taking
in
lodgers
at
the
lower
east
side
apartment
where
he
grew
up
born
under
the
name
jacob
pincus
perelmuth
he
began
his
career
working
primarily
as
a
violinist
and
bandleader
in
the
catskills
in
he
married
his
childhood
sweetheart
alice
kalmanowitz
and
three
years
later
was
discovered
by
the
great
showman
samuel
roxy
rothafel
who
hired
him
as
a
featured
singer
at
the
new

city
music
hall
people
on
broadway
said
i
belonged
in
opera
recalls
peerce
and
opera
people
said
i
belonged
on
broadway
but
when
roxy
gave
me
my
break
things
began
to
happen
and
then
came
toscanini
he
hired
me
to
sing
with
his
nbc
symphony
of
the
air
and
when
he
accepted
me
that
sort
of
clinched
things
people
said
if
he
good
enough
for
toscanini
this
guy
must
be
good
for
years
arturo
toscanini
preferred
peerce
to
all
other
tenors
in
the
world
meanwhile
in
peerce
had
joined
the
metropolitan
opera
there
he
sang
the
major
tenor
roles
up
until
when
after
losing
the
sight
in
one
eye
he
retired
from
the
met
and
began
to
concentrate
on
recitals
in
he
published
his
memoirs

keep
building
and
develop

the
point
where
she
belongs
she
growing
beautifully
and
she
will
grow
even
more
the
peerces
who
have
two
daughters
and
a
son
maintain
a
house
in
new
rochelle
as
well
as
the
westside
apartment
that
they
have
had
for
the
past
years
although
jan
peerce
stopped
playing
the
violin
long
ago
he
is
still
a
member
of
the
local
violinists
union
one
day
i
asked
them
if
they
could
give
me
an
honorary
membership
he
chuckles
revealing
his
famous
offbeat
humor
they
said
they
were
very
sorry
they
could
do
it
i
said
why
not
and
they
said
our
honorary
members
are
dead
another
time
when
he
was
the
guest
of
honor
at
a
dinner
party
the
hostess
seated
next
to
him
chatted
with
such
energy
that
peerce
had
trouble
getting
in
a
single
word
he
got
his
chance
when
the
waiter
brought
around
a
tray
of
assorted
salad
dressings
the
gabby
woman
asked
peerce
how
do
you
usually
eat
your
salad
in
complete
silence
madame
he
replied
of
the
dozens
of
conductors
he
has
worked
with
peerce
is
quick
to
name
toscanini
his
favorite
first
of
all
he
was
a
great
man
and
second
of
all
he
was
a
genius
musically
he
had
no
tricks
except
that
he
had
a
certain
vision
about
the
music
he
made
everybody
sing
or
play
as
the
composer
meant
it
to
be
and
that
was
the
secret
of
his
success
he
was
an
inspiration
to
anybody
who
worked
with
him
or
under
him
eastsider
george
plimpton
author
editor
and
adventurer
it
was
an
unusual
statement
to
come
from
a
man
who
has
made
a
career
out
of
fearing
nothing
i
scared
to
death
every
time
i
sit
down
at
a
typewriter
confessed
george
plimpton
who
in
his
years
as
america
foremost
participatory
journalist
has
played
football
with
the
detroit
lions
fought
the
light
heavyweight
champion
of
the
world
pitched
to
major
league
baseball
players
raced
cars
internationally
and
performed
with
the
new
york
philharmonic
as
a
percussionist
sometimes
you
can
do
it
and
sometimes
it
not
there
continued
plimpton
leaning
back
in
the
desk
chair
at
his
eastside
apartment
very
hard
to
work
alone
there
the
television
set
and
all
these
books
and
your
son
and
daughter
in
the
next
room
sometimes
i
have
to
get
away
so
i
go
to
bars
and
i
sit
in
a
corner
and
write
you
trapped
in
there
there
nothing
else
to
do
but
write
as
we
sat
talking
the
telephone
rang
frequently
and
plimpton
apologizing
for
the
interruption
spoke
to
the
callers
with
widely
varying
degrees
of
enthusiasm
but
was
consistently
polite
urbane
and
witty
i
noticed
a
hint
of
an
english
accent
in
his
voice
the
result
of
his
early
education
at
bernard
school
on
the
upper
east
side
followed
much
later
by
four
years
of
study
in
england
it
is
easy
to
imagine
him
stepping
into
a
boxing
ring
like
an
english
gentleman
calmly
lacing
on
his
gloves
for
a
friendly
bout
which
is
precisely
what
he
did
in
when
for
the
purpose
of
one
of
his
countless
stories
for
he
took
on
archie
moore
then
king
of
the
light
heavyweight
division
for
a
exhibition
match
in
new
york
since
that
time
plimpton
has
never
lost
his
interest
in
boxing
a
close
friend
of
muhammad
ali
who
has
followed
the
champion
around
the
world
he
made
ali
the
chief
character
of
his
book
which
came
out
in
paperback
this
month
from
berkley
as
with
most
of
plimpton
works
the
story
is
told
with
an
abundance
of
humor
currently
at
work
on
three
new
books
plimpton
emphasized
that
he
writes
on
many
subjects
outside
of
sports
a
lifelong
friend
of
the
kennedy
family
he
has
an
oral
history
volume
titled
journey
the
times
of
robert
he
is
an
associate
editor
of
magazine
and
a
regular
contributor
to
the
food
wine
his
first
love
in
fact
seems
to
be
not
sports
at
all
but
the
a
magazine
for
serious
writers
that
he
has
edited
since
its
creation
in
one
of
the
most
important
literary
magazines
in
the
world
the
is
published
four
times
a
year
as
a
journal
devoted
almost
exclusively
to
fiction
and
poetry
his
hair
is
mostly
silver
now
and
there
are
creases
starting
to
appear
on
his
ruggedly
handsome
face
but
plimpton
at
is
still
the
same
larger
charismatic
figure
he
has
been
since
he
came
to
national
attention
in
with
the
publication
of
of
my
a
book
about
his
foray
into
major
league
baseball
which
told
of
his
brief
career
as
a
quarterback
with
the
detroit
lions
cemented
his
reputation
as
the
nation
most
realistic
sportswriter
his
other
books
include
bogey
more
and
ducks
and
as
a
lecturer
he
is
in
demand
all
over
the
country
he
and
his
wife
freddy
have
been
married
for
years
born
in
new
york
city
he
grew
up
around
street
and
avenue
attended
harvard
university
where
he
edited
the
and
spent
three
years
in
the
army
before
heading
for
england
to
study
at
king
college
cambridge
during
an
easter
vacation
there
he
joined
some
friends
in
paris
to
discuss
the
launching
of
the
literary
magazine
he
has
guided
ever
since
in
said
plimpton
with
a
grin
i
supposed
to
manage
the
new
york
yankees
for
a
day
and
go
through
the
whole
procedure
of
being
fired
by
george
steinbrenner
i
hope
it
followed
by
a
beer
commercial
with
billy
martin
asked
about
his
attachment
to
the
east
side
plimpton
stressed
his
fondness
for
the
city
as
a
whole
in
the
last
couple
of
years
there
been
an
enormous
rebirth
of
excitement
about
living
in
the
city
i
think
mayor
ed
koch
has
a
lot
to
do
with
pulling
it
up
he
seems
to
fit
everywhere
if
i
saw
him
twirling
up
a
pancake
dough
in
a
pizza
shop
on
broadway
or
driving
a
avenue
bus
or
carrying
a
briefcase
into
exchange
place
i
would
be
surprised
he
a
quintessential
new
yorker
when
my
visit
with
plimpton
was
about
to
end
i
could
resist
testing
him
with
my
favorite
sports
question
who
was
the
only
man
to
play
for
the
boston
red
sox
the
boston
patriots
and
the
boston
bruins
he
could
guess
the
answer
i
told
him
was
a
guy
named
john
kiley
who
played
the
national
anthem
on
the
organ
but
plimpton
got
the
last
word
in
who
was
the
only
man
to
play
for
the
boston
bruins
and
the
boston
celtics
he
asked
i
said
i
did
know
he
smiled
and
replied

on

his

he
is
described
as
hollywood
most
tempestuous
director
and
the
screen
stormiest
rebel
but
today
at
the
years
appear
to
have
caught
up
with
otto
preminger
the
director
and
actor
who
came
to

met
success
after
success
both
in

with
such
films
as

after
that
his

took
a
dip

since
he
has
released

marked
the

based
on

preminger
seated
at
his
huge
desk
of
white
marble
in
the
lavishly
furnished
projection
room
on
the
uppermost
floor
of
his
eastside
town
house
admits
that
he
sank
over
million
of
his
own
money
into
the
picture
when
his
signed
backers
failed
to
come
through
everybody
in
europe
lies
about
money
says
preminger
in
his
deep
german
accented
voice
i
originally
wanted
to
sue
them
but
suing
does
make
sense
unless
you
are
sure
they
have
money
so
i
inquired
from
my
swiss
lawyer
and
they
did
have
money
in
switzerland
you
see
in
switzerland
the
advantage
of
the
swiss
law
is
that
is
you
sue
somebody
all
his
assets
are
frozen
immediately
luckily
enough
i
had
two
houses
that
i
wanted
to
sell
in
the
south
of
france
at
least
i
own
the
whole
film
the
question
is
now
only
will
the
picture
be
a
big
success
as
i
hope
or
not
that
is
always
the
main
thing
the
nattily
dressed
preminger
a
tall
large
man
whose
distinguished
features
and
totally
bald
head
give
the
opposite
impression
of
his
slow
movement
and
somewhat
frail
appearance
revealed
that
the
film
african
scenes
had
to
be
shot
in
kenya
rather
than
south
africa
because
they
said
they
must
see
what
i
am
shooting
and
if
they
do
like
it
they
will
confiscate
it
they
said
in
bed
you
ca
shoot
then
i
went
to
kenya
where
there
is
a
black
government
and
they
did
even
ask
for
the
script
they
said
i
could
have
anything
i
want
asked
whether
any
memorable
events
took
place
during
the
filming
preminger
snaps
even
if
there
were
i
do
remember
after
i
have
made
a
picture
and
i
have
seen
it
maybe
two
three
times
with
an
audience
i
deliberately
detach
myself
because
i
do
want
it
to
influence
my
next
picture
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
few
months
ago
my
wife
was
dressing
to
go
out
and
i
turned
on
the
television
and
saw
one
of
my
old
pictures
i
recognized
it
but
we
had
to
leave
before
it
was
finished
i
still
do
know
how
it
ends
as
for
preminger
love
life
he
writes
in
his
autobiography
i
have
a
reputation
with
women
which
is
not
entirely
deserved
though
it
is
true
that
i
had
my
share
of
them
some
of
them
stars
in
he
had
a
love
affair
with
gypsy
rose
lee
that
resulted
in
the
birth
of
his
son
erik
lee
preminger
the
boy
did
find
out
the
identity
of
his
real
father
until
the
age
of
they
were
reunited
four
years
later
and
liked
each
other

where
agent

once
broke
a
glass
over
his
head
that
took
stitches
to
close
an
unabashed
admirer
of
luxury
preminger
remains
unruffled
when
questioned
about
how
his
fancy
eastside
pad
is
in
line
with
the
philosophy
stated
in
his
autobiography
that
my
real
reward
is
my
work
itself
success
matters
only
because
without
it
one
can
not
continue
to
work
i
could
live
without
it
he
says
with
a
shrug
i
like
to
give
my
family
luxuries
but
i
could
easily
live
in
one
furnished
room

be
also

party
will
be
filing
they
normally
do
in
the
last
election
i
got
percent
of
the
vote
whereas
the
late
powell
had
wide
appeal
only
among
the
city
blacks
rangel
gained
the
support
of
many
harlem
residents
plus
a
large
majority
of
liberal
whites
on
the
upper
west
side
it
was
they
who
provided
him
with
a
margin
of
victory
over
powell
in
in
the
present
congress
rangel
has
had
the
most
liberal
voting
record
of
any
congressman
from
new
york
state
and
while
he
has
continued
to
give
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
harlem
problems
of
health
care
unemployment
and
drugs
rangel
has
recently
had
more
demands
placed
on
his
time
as
a
member
of
the
powerful
house
ways
and
means
committee
the
first
black
ever
to
serve
on
the
committee
he
is
currently
in
seniority
and
will
be
seventh
in
the
next
congress
in
his
new
york
office
where
he
generally
spends
two
days
per
week
rangel
appears
surprisingly
fresh
and
relaxed
at
the
end
of
a
working
day
as
we
settle
into
the
interview
the
elegantly
dressed
congressman
with
the
graying
moustache
and
the
rasping
voice
proves
himself
very
much
the
politician
he
uses
each
question
as
a
springboard
to
launch
into
his
favorite
topics
for
example
his
access
to
president
carter
because
of
his
various
committee
assignments
and
his
strong
support
of
most
of
carter
policies
says
rangel
i
am
forced
to
meet
with
the
president
more
than
probably
many
other
members
of
congress
i
often
stop
by
the
white
house
on
my
way
to
the
office
rangel
also
likes
to
talk
about
chip
carter
the
president
son
who
is
involved
in
a
project
called
city
in
schools
designed
to
upgrade
the
neighborhoods
outside
certain
schools
chip
has
taken
a
special
interest
in
harlem
and
one
school
in
particular
near
morningside
park
i
am
confident
that
with
chip
carter
help
and
with
my
help
morningside
park
will
soon
show
some
improvements
i
hope
that
columbia
university
will
assist
us
too
when
asked
about
the
unusual
shape
of
the
congressional
district
rangel
says
the
reason
for
it
is
that
as
we
find
populations
expanding
we
do
find
the
size
or
the
numbers
of
the
members
of
congress
expanding
we
used
to
have
half
a
dozen
members
of
congress
representing
different
parts
of
manhattan
now
we
down
to
three
me
green
and
weiss
if
you
break
it
down
you
can
see
that
adam
clayton
powell
district
used
to
be
just
harlem
as
a
member
of
the
house
select
committee
on
narcotics
and
drugs
says
rangel
i
have
gone
to
moscow
to
try
to
encourage
them
to
do
more
in
the
area
of
controlling
opium
i
have
been
to
thailand
for
the
same
reason
that
one
area
in
which
i
have
great
disappointment
in
this
administration
i
find
efforts
of
nixon
to
be
greater
than
carter
the
office
of
drug
abuse
was
disbanded
by
carter
another
field
in
which
he
finds
carter
at
fault
is
health
care
i
support
kennedy
proposal
said
the
congressman
there
no
question
that
for
reasons
the
president
has
put
his
national
health
program
on
the
back
burner
but
to
think
that
any
program
could
be
directly
controlled
by
economic
needs
rather
than
by
the
medical
needs
of
the
people
is
something
i
can
not
accept
the
ultraliberal
rangel
one
of
the
most
vociferous
supporters
of
ambassador
andrew
young
still
lives
in
the
same
building
where
he
was
born
years
ago
whenever
he
not
in
washington
he
dropped
out
of
high
school
to
enlist
in
the
army
and
spent
four
years
compiling
a
distinguished
service
record
including
a
presidential
citation
and
three
battle
stars
once
he
returned
to
new
york
rangel
completed
high
school
went
to
college
and
entered
law
school
on
a
full
scholarship
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar
in
in
he
was
elected
to
the
first
of
two
terms
in
the
new
york
state
assembly
married
and
with
two
children
congressman
rangel
believes
that
his
future
lies
primarily
in
the
ways
and
means
committee
which
handles
such
giant
concerns
as
taxes
trade
health
insurance
social
security
and
welfare
in
order
to
maintain
his
popularity
throughout
the
congressional
district
he
must
continue
to
support
those
programs
that
benefit
his
constituents
in
both
harlem
and
the
upper
west
side
how
can
this
be
done
if
we
going
to
use
the
tax
system
to
make
incentives
for
the
business
community
to
help
the
economy
he
replies
we
need
to
bring
the
disadvantaged
into
the
mainstream

my

remember
leaving

walking
up
sixth

saying
that

i
know
absolutely
nothing
about
it
the

it
one
of

most

rehearsed

his

at

he
began

soon
after
moving

about
the
man
whose
quiet
farm
became
the
epicenter
of
the
california
gold
rush
it
the
darndest
story
ever
because
it
tells
how
a
man
who
a
tremendous
idealist
came
to
this
country
from
switzerland
to
found
a
new
utopian
agrarian
state
with
cattle
and
fields
of
grain
and
vineyards
when
the
gold
rush
started
sutter
whole
society
was
ruined
and
it
is
an
incredible
parallel
for
our
time
in
that
our
pursuit
of

goods
tends
to
make

sheldon

this
spring
in
boston
sheldon
and
i
have
been
talking
about
the
possibility
of
expansion
but
we
have
a
musical
to
write
first
based
on
a
wonderful
the
frank
capra
movie
at
the
same
time
raposo
is
collaborating
with
hal
david
on
another
musical
and
writing
songs
for
a
sequel
to
muppet
but
with
all
his
success
joe
admits
to
having
a
trunk
of
songs
that
are
unrecorded
and
many
of
them
i
feel
are
right
up
on
a
par
with
anything
i
ever
done
but
they
sit
there
and
nobody
grabs
them
you
have
to
wait
a
lot
of
people
think
if
i
only
had
the
talent
to
write
a
hit
song
but
writing
a
great
song
is
enough
you
have
to
get
the
right
recording
at
the
right
time
apart
from
being
a
creative
artist
and
a
practical
businessman

both

joe

i
a
pretty
handy
carpenter
a
fair
electrician
with
a
mischievous
smile
he
adds
as
a
matter
of
fact
sometimes
i
think
i
should
go
into
that
because
the
music
business
is
chancy
westsider
mason
reese
not
just
another
kid
mason
i
got
two
very
very
important
pieces
of
advice
to
give
you
milton
berle
told
the
youngster
when
they
first
met
do
believe
in
hollywood
party
promises
and
practice
practice
and
rehearse
uncle
miltie
words
have
been
a
useful
lesson
for
mason
reese
the
boy
wonder
of
television
in
at
the
age
of
mason
skyrocketed
to
fame
by
winning
a
clio
award
for
best
male
in
a
tv
commercial
in
the
same
year
he
the
douglas
for
a
week
and
became
a
children
reporter
for
his
picture
appeared
in
and
on
the
cover
of
mason
unique
face
and
voice
became
known
to
millions
since
that
time
however
there
have
been
a
few
disappointments
mixed
in
with
the
triumphs
at
mason
is
wiser
and
more
philosophical
about
show
business
along
with
his
parents
he
has
learned
not
to
place
faith
in
verbal
agreements
as
berle
cautioned
the
reeses
welcome
me
into
their
west
end
avenue
home
as
i
take
a
seat
beside
the
borgasmord
kid
and
look
around
me
at
the
chagall
prints
bill
and
sonia
mason
parents
pull
up
armchairs
to
listen
in
and
help
out
but
during
the
interview
mason
needs
no
more
help
with
his
answers
than
he
did
with
his
first
audition
at
age
when
he
beat
out
other
children
to
become
the
spokesman
for
ivory
snow
after
that
he
endorsed
such
products
as
ralston
purina
thick
and
frosty
and
underwood
meat
spread
winning
a
total
of
seven
clios
to
date
he
been
with
mike
douglas
for
three
weeks
and
has
appeared
as
a
television
guest
with
countless
other
celebrities
one
of
my
first
questions
is
about
children
rights
i
think
children
have
enough
rights
as
it
is
he
says
they
with
their
families
they
go
to
school
they
have
the
pleasure
of
learning
and
they
realize
that
when
they
grow
up
they
be
able
to
have
more
and
more
fun
as
long
as
they
do
go
on
a
mad
rampage
when
they
kids
which
type
of
people
are
most
likely
to
grab
him
or
pick
him
up
always
the
italian
ladies
and
the
jewish
grandmothers
he
says
authoritatively
some
people
do
want
to
treat
a
kid
like
a
human
being
they
want
them
like
a
puppy
dog
instead
of
petting
pinching
when
it
comes
time
to
talk
about
mason
ventures
bill
a
producer
of
audiovisual
shows
and
an
expert
in
design
work
takes
over
he
tells
about
the
broadway
show
that
was
written
and
ready
to
go
with
mason
as
one
of
the
leads
that
folded
up
and
disappeared
without
warning
or
explanation
he
tells
about
the
abc
pilot
titled
which
cost
to
make
and
was
never
televised
about
the
movie
offers
that
were
never
followed
through
about
the
cosell
with
mason
as
that
was
canceled
shortly
after
it
began
in
spite
of
these
setbacks
mason
recently
did
some
munchkins
commercials
for
dunkin
donuts
and
will
go
to
california
this
summer
to
do
some
ads
for
birdseye
frozen
french
fries
while
the
reeses
remain
optimistic
about
the
future
they
try
not
to
build
up
their
hopes
on
a
new
project
unless
it
is
something
solid
for
show
business
is
after
all
a
business
mason
has
lived
on
the
west
side
for
all
of
his
years
i
do
seem
to
understand
why
everyone
thinks
the
east
side
is
classier
he
says
i
think
they
friendlier
people
on
the
west
side
because
people
on
the
east
side
get
snobby
most
of
my
friends
are
on
the
west
side
his
favorite
eating
places
i
love
the
greek
restaurants
the
four
brothers
broadway
and
the
argo
columbus
greeks
are
okay
are
they
mom
i
like
restaurants
that
are
a
little
bit
dumpy
without
much
decor
when
i
run
out
of
questions
i
ask
mason
if
there
are
any
other
comments
he
wants
to
make
i
think
you
asked
what
everyone
else
has
asked
he
replies
honestly
and
then
with
a
smile
except
that
i
given
you
different
answers
wait
there
one
thing
he
goes
on
i
like
my
allowance
raised
to
five
dollars
then
leaning
back
on
the
sofa
looking
as
content
as
a
man
celebrating
his
birthday
he
adds
i
really
had
no
gripes
in
life
except
that
i
like
people
to
stop
calling
me
a
midget
and
to
stop
pinching
me
some
people
who
have
never
met
mason
reese
in
person
unfairly
assume
that
he
is
a
spoiled
brat
with
pushy
exploitive
parents
in
fact
bill
and
sonia
are
warm
creative
people
who
are
fully
aware
of
the
great
responsibility
they
have
in
bringing
up
their
extraordinary
son
mason
is
not
only
brilliant
but
a
gentleman
he
should
be
making
movies
and
with
a
bit
of
luck
he
will
be
soon
having
met
him
i
can
only
repeat
not
improve
on
the
words
of
tony
randall
i
tell
you
this
with
neither
hesitation
nor
embarrassment
i
a
fan
of
his
for
life
westsider
marty
reisman
america
player
marty
reisman
was
ready
for
tonight
but
was
tonight
ready
for
marty
reisman
in
a
recent
tv
appearance
his
name
was
announced
and
he
started
across
the
stage
toward
the
desk
of
guest
host
john
davidson
then
suddenly
he
seemed
to
get
lost
in
the
floodlights
for
a
few
seconds
the
television
audience
did
know
what
was
happening
an
anonymous
cameraman
raced
out
of
the
wings
to
guide
marty
to
his
destination
my
gosh
that
never
happened
before
laughed
davidson
but
humorous
stumbling
may
well
have
been
part
of
his
act
because
as
america
table
tennis
player
he
very
often
does
things
that
have
been
done
before
on
tonight
he
returned
shots
with
his
foot
and
behind
his
back
broke
a
cigarette
with
his
slam
shot
that
has
been
clocked
at
miles
per
hour
and
soon
had
davidson
sprawled
across
the
table
trying
to
reach
shots
that
came
back
of
their
own
at
reisman
rhymes
with
policeman
is
still
the
nation
highest
paid
player
in
exhibitions
the
stunts
that
he
has
developed
over
the
past
years
make
his
games
pure
entertainment
but
marty
is
more
than
a
player
he
is
a
personality
a
man
with
a
thousand
stories
to
tell
and
an
instant
friend
to
the
people
who
visit
his
table
tennis
center
on
street
just
west
of
broadway
i
feel
i
moving
with
the
times
he
remarks
late
one
evening
at
the
center
when
from
an
athletic
professional
point
of
view
some
people
would
think
about
retirement
my
career
is
on
the
point
of
fresh
blossoming
he
is
referring
to
the
fact
that
his
autobiography
money
published
in
is
now
being
converted
into
a
movie
script
and
other
things
are
happening
several
months
ago
his
table
tennis
parlor
was
the
scene
of
a
unique
recording
session
a
piece
of
music
titled
overture
for
flute
cello
synthesizer
and
two
composed
especially
for
reisman
the
event
was
followed
by
a
regular
tournament
and
this
fall
marty
has
a
exhibition
tour
lined
up
i
started
playing
on
the
lower
east
side
about
he
says
a
year
later
at
the
age
of
i
was
the
new
york
city
junior
champion
at
i
represented
the
united
states
in
the
world
championship
which
was
held
in
london
at
wembley
stadium
there
were
people
watching
i
lost
in
the
quarterfinals
the
next
year
i
made
it
to
the
semifinals
and
received
a
rating
of
number
three
in
the
world
that
year
was
probably
the
peak
of
marty
career
from
a
purely
athletic
standpoint
although
he
was
good
enough
to
win
the
championship
in
and
what
distinguishes
him
from
other
players
however
is
the
variety
and
richness
of
his
experiences
in
the
world
of
for
three
years
he
toured
with
the
harlem
globetrotters
as
their
star
attraction
at
halftime
he
spent
several
years
in
the
far
east
as
well
and
was
in
hanoi
when
the
french
were
defeated
at
dien
bien
phu
altogether
he
has
played
in
countries
and
has
picked
up
such
titles
as
south
american
champion
canadian
champion
and
british
champion
he
once
taught
the
game
to
a
chimpanzee
the
chimp
managed
to
return
the
ball
up
to
four
times
in
a
row
but
the
most
astounding
thing
about
him
recalls
marty
was
his
short
span
of
attention
when
the
ball
was
about
an
inch
from
his
racket
he
turn
his
head
away
and
get
smacked
in
the
face
as
the
title
of
his
autobiography
indicates
marty
has
also
been
known
to
place
a
wager
on
occasion
i
hustled
when
i
had
to
he
confesses
but
it
has
been
my
way
of
life
i
do
misrepresent
myself
i
play
against
the
best
players
in
the
world
all
over
the
world
wherever
i
am
i
create
the
drama
the
action
the
excitement
because
of
the
large
sums
of
money
i
bet
in
one
of
his
biggest
hustles
he
flew
to
omaha
nebraska
under
the
guise
of
a
baby
crib
salesman
to
help
a
man
who
had
been
hustled
himself

long
been
a

a

the

human

reisman
is
something
different
if
he
says
be
there
at
he
might
show
up
at
the
next
day
but
he
concedes
if
marty

ruggiero
ricci
world
violinist
it
was
sunday
october
four
days
later
on
black
thursday
wall
street
would
be
rocked
by
the
biggest
losses
in
its
history
and
the
nation
would
be
plunged
into
its
greatest
crisis
since
the
civil
war
but
october
still
belonged
to
the
roaring
twenties
and
on
that
date
the
most
highly
publicized
event
to
take
place
in
manhattan
was
a
violin
concert
by
a
wunderkind
named
ruggiero
ricci
who
delivered
a
flawless
performance
of
the
mendelssohn
violin
concerto
and
was
lauded
as
a
genius
by
the
city
leading
music
critics
that
concert
made
ricci
career
in
the
years
that
followed
the
boy
virtuoso
earned
an
annual
salary
higher
than
that
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
story
might
have
ended
there
but
unlike
most
prodigies
who
burn
themselves
out
early
ruggiero
ricci
has
continued
to
grow
in
stature
as
an
artist
since
the
he
has
been
considered
one
of
the
greatest
living
violinists
and
with
more
than
recordings
to
his
credit
he
is
the
soloist
instrumental
or
vocal
in
the
world
today
especially
in
demand
abroad
he
has
made
five
trips
to
australia
and
three
to
the
soviet
union
where
he
was
obliged
to
play
nine
encores
at
his
debut
appearance
twenty
of
his
concerts
in
west
germany
were
sold
out
a
year
in
advance
and
more
than
a
dozen
of
his
south
american
tours
have
been
sellouts
as
well
i
travel
most
of
the
year
except
maybe
a
month
off
in
the
summer
says
ricci
a
short
man
of
with
large
sparkling
eyes
jet
black
brows
and
a
soft
slightly
accented
voice
that
sounds
as
if
he
were
born
in
europe
he
sits
curled
up
in
a
corner
of
the
couch
in
his
magnificent
westside
apartment
i
dislike
to
travel
in
the
old
days
there
were
a
lot
of
airplane
breakdowns
and
we
were
always
hung
up
in
airports
waiting
for
them
to
fix
the
plane
today
they
have
all
these
hijacking
searches
you
have
to
go
through
the
machines
they
have
these
enormous
lines
and
when
you
get
to
the
hotel
there
a
line
a
mile
long
he
believes
that
russian
audiences
are
the
best
public
in
the
world
they
do
applaud
between
the
movements
like
they
do
in
new
york
always
interesting
to
visit
a
place
for
the
first
time
i
do
want
to
go
to
russia
so
much
anymore
we
found
out
it
boring
there
nothing
to
do
and
it
not
much
fun
there
no
tipping
so
the
hotel
service
is
very
bad
it
takes
an
hour
to
get
breakfast
you
can
sit
there
and
be
completely
ignored
by
the
waiter
to
make
a
telephone
call
it
easier
to
go
to
the
moon
ricci
repertoire
which
includes
more
than
concertos
from
the
to
the
centuries
is
the
largest
of
any
violinist
now
before
the
public
this
calls
for
a
lot
of
practice
when
you
a
kid
says
ricci
you
hate
to
practice
and
when
you
a
grownup
practice
is
a
pleasure
it
lets
you
escape
all
the
other
junk
i
do
have
any
trouble
practicing
in
this
building
because
the
old
buildings
have
heavy
walls
but
if
you
want
to
practice
in
a
hotel
that
hard
sometimes
you
can
use
a
mute
or
you
turn
on
the
television
then
they
do
complain
if
they
hear
a
fiddle
they
complain
ricci
has
two
major
concerts
in
new
york
this
year
the
first
will
take
place
at
carnegie
hall
on
saturday
march
when
ricci
will
join
such
celebrities
as
andres
segovia
yehudi
menuhin
jose
ferrer
rampal
and
peter
ustinov
for
a
historic
musical
program
to
commemorate
the
anniversary
of
symphonicum
europae
a
foundation
whose
aim
is
to
promote
international
understanding
and
cooperation
by
sponsoring
performances
in
every
country
ricci
other
new
york
concert
will
mark
another
anniversary
it
will
be
on
october
years
to
the
day
since
he
took
the
city
by
storm
the
early
concerts
i
remember
very
well
says
the
maestro
who
was
born
in
san
francisco
to
a
family
of
italian
immigrants
for
most
prodigies
the
problem
is
the
parents
my
father
just
was
every
smart
about
how
to
handle
me
nowadays
they
do
have
prodigies
anymore
because
there
is
any
profit
in
it
in
the
old
days
a
kid
could
get
to
dollars
a
night
everybody
had
their
kid
study
none
of
his
five
children
has
turned
out
to
be
a
prodigy
but
three
of
them
are
already
professionals
in
the
performing
arts
ricci
slender
attractive
wife
julia
is
an
active
participant
in
his
career
westsiders
for
many
years
the
riccis
enjoy
such
local
restaurants
as
la
tablita
alfredo
and
the
cafe
des
artistes
asked
what
he
likes
best
about
his
career
ricci
says
it
is
making
recordings
it
more
leisurely
you
do
have
all
the
headaches
the
newest
development
is
records
the
music
goes
straight
from
the
mike
into
the
cutting
head
master
and
there
no
way
to
erase
if
it
a
recording
and
you
make
a
mistake
on
the
minute
you
have
to
start
over
i
just
finished
recording
the
on
it
coming
out
this
month
the
caprices
are
very
rarely
performed
in
public
because
they
so
difficult
westsider
buddy
rich
monarch
of
the
drums
mediocrity
has
no
place
in
my
life
says
buddy
rich
wrapped
in
a
bathrobe
at
his
luxurious
westside
apartment
anybody
who
is
expert
at
what
they
do
i
admire
whether
drumming
tennis
or
whatever
if
they
do
it
at
the
top
of
their
form
constantly
i
become
a
fan
dragging
deeply
on
his
cigarette
the
man
whom
critics
and
fellow
jazz
artists
have
frequently
called
the
greatest
drummer
in
the
world
perhaps
of
all
time
dismisses
such
labels
with
something
approaching
annoyance
i
do
think
anybody
is
the
best
of
anything
in
the
world
babe
record
was
broken
joe
louis
was
knocked
out
i
rather
not
be
the
world
greatest
anything
i
rather
be
what
i
am
which
is
a
good
drummer
it
is
an
unexpected
statement
to
come
from
a
bandleader
and
drummer
known
more
for
arrogance
than
modesty
but
in
an
interview
buddy
complex
personality
unfolds
itself
in
all
its
richness
and
he
proves
to
be
far
more
than
a
flamboyant
musician
who
pulls
no
punches
in
buddy
hands
a
snare
drum
comes
to
life
it
whispers
shouts
purrs
snarls
chuckles
gasps
or
roars
as
the
mood
of
the
music
strikes
him
he
began
playing
in
at
the
age
of
when
his
parents
vaudeville
actors
from
brooklyn
included
him
in
their
act
and
then
made
him
the
star
by
the
age
of
he
had
toured
the
world
as
traps
the
drum
wonder
at
he
was
second
only
to
jackie
coogan
as
the
child
performer
in
america
he
began
recording
in
joined
bands
headed
by
artie
shaw
and
tommy
dorsey
and
finally
formed
his
own
band
in
over
the
next
years
as
both
a
and
as
the
sideman
in
the
business
he
made
hundreds
of
recordings
with
some
of
the
biggest
names
in
the
history
of
jazz
charlie
parker
dizzy
gillespie
oscar
peterson
lionel
hampton
count
basie
harry
james
thelonius
monk
then
in
he
formed
his
current
band
the
buddy
rich
orchestra
in
december
he
brought
the
band
to
the
chic
newly
remodeled
grand
finale
on
west
street
seated
at
his
drums
in
the
center
of
the
orchestra
he
effortlessly
mixes
snare
bass
drum
and
cymbals
in
a
whirling
benumbing
mass
of
sound
back
in
his
huge
living
room
which
is
decorated
much
like
a
summer
house
in
newport
rhode
island
buddy
says
that
his
nightclub
gigs
are
rare
we
do
about
nine
months
on
the
road
which
includes
europe
and
the
orient
all
the
cities
of
this
country
most
of
the
tours
i
on
are
percent
concert
halls
and
schools
the
main
reason
is
educational
good
for
the
young
people
to
discover
all
of
a
sudden
that
music
is
just
a
guitar
and
a
drum
and
a
bad
singer
i
think
as
young
people
become
more
sophisticated
in
their
tastes
they
begin
to
realize
that
jazz
is
just
as
high
an
art
form
as
classical
music
one
of
his
chief
gripes
about
jazz
in
america
he
explains
in
a
voice
as
rough
as
sandpaper
is
that
during
the
season
you
might
see
or
award
shows
on
television
dedicated
to
country
and
western
slop
but
you
never
see
a
jazz
presentation
in
its
true
form
when
there
an
extended
piece
of
music
they
usually
cloud
it
up
with
dancing
girls
and
trick
lighting
and
anything
that
distracts
from
the
music
instead
of
presenting
the
music
as
the
attraction
the
way
they
do
in
europe
another
sore
spot
is
the
speed
limit
i
heavily
into
sports
cars
i
used
to
race
long
ago
i
find
that
the
restrictions
placed
on
us
today
are
insane
contradictory
and
hypocritical
i
do
know
anyone
on
the
highway
who
actually
does
miles
an
hour
and
it
just
another
way
of
making
money
for
the
state
or
the
local
community
and
i
think
it
no
better
than
a
stickup
he
does
keep
any
drums
in
the
apartment
and
never
practices
i
want
my
days
to
be
as
a
man
and
i
want
my
nights
to
be
as
a
working
man
in
the
day
i
exercise
i
do
karate
i
have
a
black
belt
and
totally
disengage
myself
from
the
person
i
am
at
night
his
apartment
is
shared
by
buddy
wife
marie
and
their
daughter
cathy
a
singer
my
wife
is
just
as
beautiful
today
as
she
was
the
day
i
married
her
buddy
says
proudly
she
used
to
be
in
pictures
but
she
gave
it
up
when
we
married
now
she
a
wife
and
a
female
and
a
woman
and
she
not
into
era
and
she
not
into
got
my
thing
man
and
you
got
your
thing
she
a
woman
and
wears
dresses
so
that
i
know
she
a
woman
what
i
like
he
often
performs
free
at
prisons
and
hospitals
but
refuses
to
give
details
i
do
these
things
for
the
good
that
it
does
for
me
he
asserts
to
have
someone
write
about
it
takes
the
goodness
away
from
it
i
rather
not
have
anybody
know
what
i
do
as
long
as
i
know
buddy
suffered
a
heart
attack
in
and
has
had
others
since
but
apart
from
giving
up
liquor
he
has
made
few
adjustments
in
his
whirlwind
lifestyle
i
really
do
think
of
past
illnesses
he
declares
i
think
healthier
and
stronger
today
than
i
ever
been
in
my
life
i
smoke
more
now
and
i
run
around
more
and
i
do
more
exercise
i
do
put
too
much
reality
into
warnings
about
do
this
and
do
do
that
do
what
you
have
to
do
and
do
it
if
you
cut
out

matchless
reportorial

the
show
will
be
both
taped
and
live
says
rivera
in
an
interview
at
his
west
street
office
we
designed
the
program
so
that
it
not
a
classic
telethon
where
every
two
seconds
they
say
send
us
your
money
among
the
more
dramatic
moments
is
a
tape
of
the
seventh
annual
wall
street
charity
fund
boxing
match
which
raised
thousands
of
dollars
for
one
to
one
for
the
first
year
i
not
the
main
event
comments
rivera
who
scored
a
technical
knockout
over
his
opponent
in
my
nose
was
broken
last
year
and
they
took
out
all
the
scar
tissue
they
decided
that
my
nose
had
given
enough
for
the
cause
he
learned
most
of
his
boxing
just
street
fighting
growing
up
born
years
ago
on
the
lower
east
side
to
a
puerto
rican
father
and
a
jewish
mother
he
was
christened
gerald
rivers
and
hispanicized
his
name
while
in
college
there
are
no
scars
on
his
ruggedly
handsome
face
with
his
neatly
styled
hair
easy
smile
and
air
of
casual
masculinity
one
of
his
favorite
outfits
is
a
denim
jacket
over
a
rivera
could
easily
pass
for
a
professional
athlete
turned
matinee
idol
yet
it
is
primarily
his
literary
ability
combined
with
a
sentimentality
backed
up
by
facts
that
has
made
him
a
type
of
media
folk
hero
his
documentaries
have
earned
him
humanitarian
awards
in
addition
to
his
more
than
news
stories
rivera
has
written
four
books
including
one
on
willowbrook
i
been
back
there
many
times
and
it
still
stinks
literally
and
figuratively
says
rivera
in
his
customary
vibrant
tone
but
it
now
a
much
smaller
place
willowbrook
started
with
people
and
now
it
well
under
a
thousand
it
has
become
in
fact
one
of
the
better
institutions
but
institutions
are
not
the
answer
there
no
such
thing
as
a
good
big
institution
with
his
commitments
as
chairman
of
one
to
one
his
heavy
travel
schedule
for
and
his
new
daily
commentary
on
abc
radio
rivera
likes
to
spend
free
evenings
at
home
with
his
wife
sheri
at
their
apartment
near
lincoln
center
a
westsider
since
he
names
the
ginger
man
and
the
cafe
des
artistes
as
his
favorite
dining
spots
asked
about
the
biggest
difference
between
his
present
career
and
his
earlier
career
as
a
lawyer
rivera
says
now
i
have
the
power
to
cause
positive
change
in
a
dramatic
way
when
you
have
an
audience
of
tens
of
millions
of
people
it
a
multiple
in
terms
of
influence
and
impact
and
the
effective
delivery
of
information
as
a
broadcaster
i
found
that
one
person
can
make
a
difference
westsider
ned
rorem
author
and
pulitzer
composer
the
world
has
always
been
fascinated
by
artists
who
excel
in
more
than
one
field
there
was
richard
wagner
for
example
who
wrote
the
words
and
the
music
to
all
his
operas
cole
porter
and
bob
dylan
are
two
others
who
have
proven
their
mastery
of
both
language
and
composition
but
while
these
three
men
combined
their
talents
to
produce
great
songs
ned
rorem
has
employed
his
musical
and
literary
gifts
in
a
different
way
by
keeping
the
two
separate
he
has
gained
a
huge
reputation
as
a
composer
of
serious
music
and
also
as
a
prose
writer
of
formidable
style
in
he
won
the
pulitzer
prize
for
music
and
last
month
simon
and
schuster
published
his
eighth
book
absolute
at
rorem
has
become
somewhat
of
a
fixture
on
the
new
york
artistic
scene
who
no
longer
sparks
the
controversy
that
he
once
did
but
in
paris
where
he
spent
nine
years
during
his
early
career
in
the
rorem
was
as
for
his
socializing
as
for
his
music
with
his
handsome
youthful
good
looks
and
boyish
charm
his
biting
wit
and
his
wide
knowledge
of
the
arts
he
became
a
close
companion
of
many
of
the
leading
literary
and
musical
figures
of
france
his
recollections
of
those
years
were
carefully
recorded
in
his
first
book
paris
published
in
amid
fanfare
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
it
was
quickly
followed
by
new
york
which
was
more
popular
still
since
then
rorem
books
have
appeared
at
fairly
regular
intervals
all
of
them
either
diaries
or
essays
or
a
combination
of
both
in
print
rorem
comes
across
as
being
somewhat
disillusioned
with
life
and
art
in
person
however
he
is
a
warm
sincere
host
with
a
tendency
toward
shyness
that
does
not
come
through
in
his
books
rorem
makes
all
of
his
remarks
so
that
nothing
he
says
seems
vicious
or
outrageous
leaning
back
on
the
sofa
of
his
large
westside
apartment
with
one
hand
resting
against
his
chin
and
the
other
stroking
his
pet
cat
wallace
rorem
answers
one
of
the
first
questions
saying
that
yes
he
is
upset
by
the
negative
review
that
absolute
received
in
the
york
a
bad
review
in
the
times
can
kill
a
book
he
explains
it
killed
my
last
book
and
i
do
think
it
fair
that
they
gave
my
new
book
to
the
same
reviewer
he
made
some
of
the
same
statements
that
he
did
last
time
with
almost
the
same
wording
but
just
today
i
got
a
very
good
review
from
the
and
i
hope
there
will
be
something
in
the
york
review
of
that
even
more
important
than
the
rorem
is
considerably
more
versatile
as
a
composer
than
as
a
writer
his
output
includes
five
operas
three
symphonies
and
literally
hundreds
of
vocal
pieces
for
solo
voice
and
ensembles
of
various
sizes
and
instrumental
music
of
every
description
he
is
considered
by
many
to
be
the
world
greatest
living
composer
of
art
songs
generally
he
sets
other
people
words
to
music
asked
for
the
definition
of
an
art
song
rorem
says
i
hate
the
term
i
composed
dozens
of
arts
songs
before
ever
hearing
the
word
it
a
song
sung
by
a
trained
singer
in
concert
halls
the
piece
that
won
him
the
pulitzer
surprisingly
was
not
a
song
at
all
but
an
orchestral
work
titled
which
was
commissioned
for
the
bicentennial
by
the
late
thomas
schippers
and
the
cincinnati
symphony
this
summer
the
philadelphia
orchestra
under
eugene
ormandy
will
premiere
a
new
major
composition
of
rorem
i
feel
very
very
very
lucky
that
i
able
to
support
myself
as
a
composer
of
serious
music
he
says
my
income
is
not
so
much
from
royalties
as
from
commissions
prizes
fellowships
and
official
handouts
such
as
the
national
endowment
of
the
arts
and
the
guggenheim
fellowship
which
i
now
am
living
on
born
in
indiana
and
raised
in
chicago
rorem
began
composing
music
at
the
age
of
he
was
never
attracted
to
pop
music
and
today
he
likes
it
less
than
ever
inasmuch
as
pop
music
goes
hand
in
hand
with
high
volume
i
bitterly
resent
it
he
says
when
the
met
opera
gives
a
concert
in
central
park
the
same
night
that
the
schaefer
beer
festival
gives
one
of
their
concerts
they
crushed
like
the
runt
beneath
the
belly
of
a
great
fat
sow
when
a
desire
for
more
space
and
lower
rent
drove
rorem
from
greenwich
village
to
the
west
side
years
ago
he
feared
that
he
was
moving
to
a
big
nonartistic
bourgeois
ghetto
he
soon
changed
his
mind
in
absolute
he
makes
the
statement
from
street
to
street
the
west
side
contains
more
artists
both
performers
and
creators
than
any
concentrated
neighborhood
since
paris
in
the
one
of
rorem
favorite
westside
businesses
is
patelson
half
price
music
shop
at
street
right
across
from
the
stage
door
of
carnegie
hall
it
the
best
music
shop
in
america
he
testifies
they
have
everything
or
they
can
get
it
for
you
all
of
rorem
books
carry
a
fair
amount
of
philosophy
but
the
only
principle
that
the
artist
claims
to
have
stuck
by
during
the
entire
course
of
his
life
is
i
never
sold
out
i
never
done
what
i
did
want
to
do
i
never
been
guided
by
other
than
my
heart
and
certainly
not
by
money
westsider
julius
rudel
director
of
the
new

la
guardia
made
an
announcement
that
the
old
mecca
temple
on
west
street
would
be
converted
into
the
city
center
of
music
and
drama
as
a
result
a
new
major
company
was
born
the
new
york
city
opera
a
young
jewish
immigrant
julius
rudel
who
had
fled
austria
with
his
family
not
long
before
immediately
went
to
city
center
in
search
of
a
job
he
was
hired
as
a
rehearsal
pianist
and
in
the
years
to
come
his
talents
blossomed
forth
in
many
areas
working
quietly
behind
the
scenes
he
became
the
opera
indispensable
everything
who
not
only
knew
every
phase
of
show
production
but
could
be
called
on
to
conduct
the
orchestra
and
even
take
the
place
of
a
missing
cast
member
on
stage
rudel
versatile
musicianship
and
his
personal
charm
did
much
to
knit
the
company
together
in
the
new
york
city
opera
suffered
a
financially
disastrous
season
that
led
to
the
resignation
of
the
distinguished
erich
leinsdorf
as
director
and
chief
conductor
that
was
perhaps
the
lowest
point
in
the
history
the
board
of
directors
pored
over
dozens
of
nominations
for
leinsdorf
replacement
before
they
decided
on
the
one
person
who
had
the
confidence
of
everybody
julius
rudel
seasons
later
he
is
still
firmly
in
command
and
the
once
struggling
city
opera
has
risen
to
world
prominence
although
its
million
annual
budget
is
much
smaller
than
that
of
the
metropolitan
opera
and
the
major
houses
of
europe
rudel
has
been
able
to
get
many
singers
who
are
unequaled
anywhere
and
has
staged
far
more
new
works
by
living
composers
than
has
lincoln
center
other
opera
house
apart
from
its
musical
significance
the
city
opera
has
become
a
sort
of
living
symbol
for
the
arts
in
america
flourishing
in
the
face
of
financial
hardships
and
somehow
emerging
more
creative
more
artistically
exciting
because
of
those
hardships
why
else
would
people
like
beverly
sills
and
sherrill
milnes
perform
at
city
for
a
top
fee
of
or
even
for
free
when
they
can
get
for
a
night
work
elsewhere
we
build
loyalties
explains
rudel
in
his
delicate
accent
the
morning
after
conducting
a
benefit
performance
of
merry
a
lot
of
our
singers
go
on
to
other
companies
but
they
come
back
they
do
forget
us
the
new
york
city
opera
has
produced
more
great
singers
than
probably
any
other
company
in
the
world
it
is
early
even
for
this
man
who
begins
his
work
as
soon
as
he
get
up
and
keeps
going
till
late
at
night
with
his
multiple
roles
as
music
director
chief
conductor
administrator
impresario
and
goodwill
ambassador
clad
in
his
colorful
dressing
gown
his
thick
silver
hair
shining
he
seems
an
entirely
different
person
from
the
magnetic
orchestral
leader
whose
presence
on
the
podium
generally
guarantees
a
full
house
at
his
expansive
central
park
west
apartment
he
is
and
to
the
point
and
fiercely
proud
of
the
city
opera
achievements
we
try
to
look
at
every
opera
we
do
with
fresh
eyes
as
if
it
had
never
been
done
before
we
try
to
reexamine
everything
about
the
opera
sometimes
the
tradition
attached
to
a
work
differs
from
what
the
composer
and
librettist
intended
tradition
was
defined
by
a
famous
conductor
long
ago
as
last
bad
performance
for
example
in
there
a
character
who
had
been
traditionally
portrayed
as
blind
but
it
makes
no
sense
in
the
story
for
him
to
be
blind
so
we
do
play
him
that
way
we
restoring
the
classics
not
changing
them

tell
her
i

you
at

foremost

at
one

the
name

was
synonymous
with
one
thing
only
the
revolutionary
polio
vaccine
discovered
by
jonas

in
in
the
however
another

figure
of

has

jonas

who
is
probably
the
most
highly
respected
and
child
psychologist
in
america
today
the
most
successful
of
his
five
books
every
child
would
like
his
parents
to
has
been
translated
into
languages
while
his
most
recent
work
titled
simply

by

a
highly
energetic
man
who
bears
a
close

phil

salk
recently
invited
me
to
share
his
thoughts
in
an
interview
at
his
upper
east
side
apartment
what
i
try
to
do
as
a
psychologist
he
said
sitting
in
a
large
circular
chair
in
his
spacious
library
is
to
use
all
the
media
to
present
what
i
consider
useful
psychological
information
that
has
been
distilled
for
the
consumer
to
take
the
jargon
out
of
it
and
the
ambiguity
so
people
can
use
it
to
deal
effectively
with
their
problems
while
most
people
see
me
as
a
child
psychologist
i
really
an
adult
psychologist
who
has
focused
on
some
of
the
most
difficult
issues
that
affect
all
people
in
my
initial
years
of
practice
it
became
clear
to
me
that
most
of
the
problems
originated
in
childhood
and
i
felt
that
perhaps
the
front
line
of
mental
health
is
really
in
those
early
critical
years
since
he
has
been
writing
a
column
titled
you
and
your
family
for
magazine
which
has
a
readership
of
million
i
frequently
deal
with
family
concerns
including
problems
that
have
to
do
with
older
people
he
explained
i
choose
a
different
topic
each
month
frequently
the
topic
revolves
around
a
number
of
letters
that
come
in
the
june
issue
for
example
has
an
unusually
large
column
because
we
dealing
with
sexuality
we
get
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
letters
so
i
ca
answer
them
personally
but
i
do
read
them
all
when
i
giving
a
speech
across
the
country
i
like
to
use
airplane
time
to
catch
up
on
my
mail
as
a
television
personality
he
appears
at
least
twice
a
week
on
center
his
manner
is
no
deception
salk
does
each
of
his
broadcasts
live
without
a
script
speaking
spontaneously
on
a
current
issue
his
latest
book
answers
questions
ranging
from
the
spacing
of
children
to
problems
specific
to
teenagers
when
asked
how
his
approach
compares
to
that
of
ann
landers
or
dear
abby
salk
replies
i
must
say
that
they
fall
far
short
of
what
i
trying
to
do
these
people
are
not
professional
psychologists
they
tend
to
sensationalize
to
appeal
to
the
voyeuristic
tendencies
people
have
i
not
saying
they
do
help
people
but
they
do
always
provide
people
with
knowledge
a
good
deal
of
what
i
say
is
not
direct
advice
in
answering
a
question
i
try
to
provide
knowledge
about
the
problem
which
the
person
can
use
to
answer
his
or
her
own
question
i
really
feel
i
should
give
people
a
series
of
do
and
his
knowledge
is
based
on
a
career
as
a
professional
clinical
psychologist
following
his
graduation
from
the
doctoral
program
at
the
university
of
michigan
salk
spent
three
years
teaching
at

salk
won
the
custody
of
his
two
children
pia
and
eric
in
after
a
divorce
trial
in
which
it
was
ruled
that
he
was
the
parent
that
can
best
nurture
their
complex
needs
and
social
development
a
problem
of
many
parents
he
said
is
not
that
they
spend
too
little
time
with
their
children
but
that
it
basically
useless
time
because
not
actively
involved
with
the
child
salk
himself
makes
a
point
of
having
breakfast
and
dinner
with
pia
and
eric
virtually
every
day
and
includes
them
in
his
social
life
whenever
possible
their
friends
are
frequently
my
dinner
guests
each
summer
he
spends
three
months
with
them
at
an
island
retreat
in

his
professional
commitments
salk
enjoys
cooking

three
children

discuss
such
topics
as
love
and
attachment
divorce
and
making
a
family
work
the
programs
he
said
are
geared
to
family
viewing

so
children
and
their
parents
can
watch
together
eastsider
francesco
scavullo
photographer
of
the
world
most
beautiful
women
as
richard
stolley
the
managing
editor
of
magazine
is
fond
of
saying
every
publication
on
the
newsstand
is
actually
two
publications
one
is
the
inner
contents
and
the
other
far
more
important
in
terms
of
sales
is
the
front
cover
a
stunning
cover
can
make
the
difference
of
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
revenue
for
a
national
magazine
and
why
has
engaged
the
talents
of
photographer
francesco
scavullo
for
virtually
every
one
of
its
covers
for
the
last
years
he
has
done
album
covers
and
posters
for
paul
mccartney
barbra
streisand
donna
summer
judy
collins
and
many
others
among
the
publications
that
rely
on
his
most
often
for
covers
are
home
and
the
magazine
that
started
it
all
which
ran
its
first
scavullo
cover
in
when
he
was
still
a
teenager
himself
he
never
had
any
formal
training
in
photography
but
got
plenty
of
practice
during
his
manhattan
boyhood
when
he
began
taking
pictures
of
his
sisters
and
their
girlfriends
francesco
delighted
in
applying
makeup
to
their
faces
running
his
hands
through
their
hair
and
dressing
them
in
sexy
gowns
he
quickly
made
two
discoveries
first
that
there
no
such
thing
as
an
ugly
woman
and
second
that
the
photographer
and
his
subject
must
be
personally
compatible
although
he
charges
approximately
for
unsolicited
private
portraits
scavullo
wo
photograph
anyone
with
whom
he
has
bad
rapport
and
that
includes
all
people
who
do
take
care
of
themselves
physically
or
abuse
themselves
with
drugs
a
small
lithe
man
of
who
walks
with
the
gracefulness
of
a
dancer
and
looks
considerably
younger
than
his
years
scavullo
recently
agreed
to
an
interview
at
the
town
house
on
east
street
that
serves
as
both
his
studio
and
his
home
dressed
in
blue
jeans
an
white
shirt
and
western
boots
the
chatty
unpretentious
photographer
sat
back
on
the
couch
with
his
arms
behind
his
head
and
a
mischievous
smile
planted
on
his
face
asked
about
the
large
pills
he
popped
into
his
mouth
from
time
to
time
scavullo
explained
that
they
were
vitamins
and
organic
supplements
i
very
he
said
in
a
gravelly
voice
with
a
broad
new
york
accent
i
do
eat
meat
and
i
very
seldom
have
even
chicken
or
fish
i
do
drink
tea
or
coffee
or
alcohol
except
for
a
little
wine
a
lot
of
people
stop
smoking
when
they
start
working
for
me
because
i
hate
it
all
this
pollution
in
the
air
of
new
york
already
i
think
smoking
is
great
if
you
live
out
in
the
west
and
you
sit
on
top
of
a
mountain
like
in
the
marlboro
commercials
as
we
were
talking
in
his
spacious
living
room
decorated
with
own
paintings
a
member
of
his
staff
came
from
the
studio
below
and
said
in
reference
to
a
woman
who
was
being
made
up
for
a
shooting
session
she
still
not
ready
francesco
scavullo
sighed
a
seating
with
a
man
takes
minutes
he
remarked
and
with
a
woman
it
takes
the
whole
afternoon
makeup
he
added
is
used
more
intensely
in
photography
than
it
is
in
the
street
i
think
women
look
best
without
any
type
of
makeup
in
the
daytime
sunlight
has
a
very
bad
effect
on
it
some
of
the
ladies
going
by
on
the
street
look
like
they
holding
a
mask
a
fraction
of
an
inch
away
from
their
face
he
has
never
developed
the
habit
of
stopping
beautiful
women
on
the
sidewalk
but
said
a
grinning
scavullo
if
i
see
someone
wildly
attractive
walking
by
i
get
excited
i
might
turn
around
and
whistle
or
something
number
one
on
his
list
of
the
world
most
beautiful
women
is
old
brooke
shields
who
also
lives
on
the
upper
east
side
she
is
one
of
the
models
actresses
and
other
celebrities
featured
in
his
first
book
on
which
came
out
in
paperback
last
month
from
vintage
press
the
volume
is
filled
with
shots
of
faces
many
of
them
showing
the
difference
before
and
after
the
scavullo
treatment
it
is
accompanied
by
frank
interviews
dealing
with
clothing
diet
exercise
makeup
and
related
subjects
on
his
second
book
was
published
in
and
he
has
two
more
in
the
works
a
picture
book
on
baseball
with
text
by
christopher
of
the
york
and
a
retrospective
volume
covering
his
photographs
from
to
both
will
be
out
next
year
a
resident
of
the
upper
east
side
since
he
likes
to
dance
until
dawn
at
studio
whenever
i
do
have
to
get
up
too
early
the
next
day
asked
about
his
favorite
local
restaurants
he
said
he
rarely
goes
to
any
but
that
his
entire
staff
orders
lunch
almost
every
day
from
greener
pastures
a
natural
foods
restaurant
on
east
street
beauty
he
believes
is
an
advantage
to
everything
man
woman
child
flower
state
i
mean
everything
beauty
is
the
most
fabulous
thing
in
the
world
i
hate
ugliness
his
advice
to
amateur
photographers
get
a
polaroid
it
is
a
very
flattering
camera
to
use
because
it
washes
everything
out
he
could
resist
adding
if
you
ca
be
photographed
by
scavullo
have
your
picture
taken
with
a
polaroid
westsider
roger
sessions
composer
of
the
future
the
story
of
western
music
from
the
baroque
era
to
the
present
day
has
been
written
largely
by
men
whose
contributions
to
their
art
were
underappreciated
during
their
own
lifetimes
serious
music
has
a
tendency
to
be
ahead
of
its
time
and
must
wait
for
the
public
taste
to
catch
up
before
it
can
be
accepted
such
is
the
case
with
roger
sessions
for
at
least
years
he
has
been
considered
by
the
american
academic
establishment
to
be
one
of
the
most
gifted
and
original
composers
of
his
generation
but
his
work
has
started
to
gain
wide
recognition
with
the
general
public
only
since
the
early
today
at
he
is
comfortable
in
his
role
as
the
elder
statesman
of
american
concert
music
although
relatively
few
of
his
works
have
been
recorded
they
place
extraordinary
demands
on
both
performer
and
listener
sessions
continues
to
write
music
with
practically
unabated
energy
his
most
significant
official
honor
came
in
when
the
pulitzer
prize
committee
issued
a
special
citation
naming
him
one
of
the
most
musical
composers
of
the
century
since
his
early
session
has
led
a
dual
career
as
a
composer
and
a
teacher
of
music
theory
a
former
professor
at
both
the
university
of
california
berkeley
and
princeton
university
he
has
published
several
books
on
his
musical
ideas
and
now
teaches
two
days
a
week
at
the
juilliard
school
at
lincoln
center
when
i
heard
that
his
piano
sonatas
were
going
to
be
performed
soon
on
west
street
i
called
him
to
request
an
interview
and
he
promptly
concurred
we
met
for
lunch
at
la
crepe
on
broadway
and
over
the
meal
sessions
revealed
himself
to
be
a
man
of
wit
humility
and
charm
speaking
of
his
piano
sonatas
which
will
be
performed
at
carnegie
recital
hall
in
february
march
and
april
sessions
commented
in
his
slow
precise
manner
of
speech
that
the
first
one
was
composed
in
the
second
one
was
composed
in
and
the
third
one
was
composed
in
one
sonata
will
be
performed
on
each
program
i
have
heard
the
young
lady
play
one
of
them
she
going
to
come
and
play
for
me
today
i
helping
her
to
prepare
them
because
they
difficult
and
they
take
a
lot
of
practice
her
name
is
miss
rebecca
la
becque
i
just
laid
eyes
on
her
for
the
first
time
last
week
nearly
half
of
his
works
have
been
composed
in
the
last
years
some
are
quite
melodic
others
are
so
atonal
and
eery
that
to
some
people
they
suggest
the
rhythm
of
the
universe
itself
or
music
from
the
stars
one
remarkable
aspect
of
his
compositions
is
that
no
two
are
even
vaguely
alike
another
is
that
they
come
in
so
many
different
instrumental
combinations
besides
his
piano
works
he
has
composed
for
violin
organ
cello
chorus
and
solo
voice
in
addition
there
are
his
string
quartets
his
rhapsodies
his
nine
symphonies
and
one
of
the
most
distinguished
operas
ever
written
by
an
american
why
write
in
so
many
forms
you
might
say
i
paid
to
he
explained
ordering
a
second
espresso
and
lighting
his
pipe
generally
when
i
write
a
big
work
it
for
a
specific
purpose
his
eighth
symphony
for
example
was
written
for
the
new
york
philharmonic
to
commemorate
the
orchestra
anniversary
when
i
asked
sessions
whether
he
was
concerned
that
most
of
his
works
are
not
available
on
albums
he
said
calmly
i
never
have
tried
to
get
my
works
recorded
or
performed
i
decided
years
ago
that
people
would
have
to
come
to
me
i
was
coming
to
them
things
move
a
little
more
slowly
that
way
but
one
knows
that
everything
one
gets
is
perfectly
genuine
when
i
wrote
my
first
symphony
otto
klemperer
said
he
would
dare
to
conduct
it
so
i
conducted
it
myself
it
would
be
easy
nowadays
even
the
princeton
student
orchestra
played
it
a
few
years
ago
and
did
do
too
badly
orchestra
players
get
used
to
the
idiom
and
people
get
used
to
listening
the
only
thing
is
he
added
with
a
chuckle
i
keep
getting
ahead
in
that
respect
he
was
born
in
brooklyn
in
and
moved
to
massachusetts
at
age
but
sessions
noted
that
i
do
have
some
memories
of
the
inside
of
the
house
he
wrote
his
first
opera
at
and
graduated
from
harvard
at
from
until
he
lived
in
italy
and
germany
supported
by
scholarships
shortly
after
hitler
came
to
power
he
returned
to
the
and
not
long
afterward
joined
the
faculty
at
princeton
where
he
remained
until
then
he
taught
at
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
for
eight
years
before
returning
to
princeton
where
he
remained
until
his
mandatory
retirement
in
since
that
time
he
has
taught
at
juilliard
he
and
his
wife
elizabeth
have
been
married
for
years
they
have
two
children
and
two
grandchildren
said
the
composer
i
learned
that
i
had
a
grandson
just
a
few
hours
after
i
gotten
the
citation
from
the
pulitzer
prize
committee
and
the
grandson
was
much
more
exciting
with
all
due
respect
a
resident
of
princeton
new
jersey
except
for
the
one
night
each
week
that
he
spends
on
the
west
side
sessions
is
now
eagerly
awaiting
the
performance
of
his
ninth
symphony
it
was
completed
in
october
and
will
be
premiered
in
syracuse
shortly
in
his
princeton
study
he
is
kept
constantly
busy
composing
new
works
writing
letters
and
correcting
proofs
i
do
have
any
hobbies
he
remarked
at
the
end
of
the
interview
i
like
good
books
but
i
do
get
much
time
to
read
them
if
i
go
a
few
days
without
composing
i
start
to
feel
a
little
bit
depressed
eastsider
dick
shawn
veteran
comic
talks
about
at
first
dick
shawn
name
keeps
cropping
up
these
days
the
last
time
he
made
a
big
splash
in
new
york
was
two
years
ago
when
his
show
shawn
is
the
second
greatest
entertainer
in
the
whole
wide
played
at
the
promenade
theatre
for
weeks
but
last
fall
he
gained
millions
of
new
fans
with
his
sparkling
appearances
on
the
network
variety
show
starring
mary
tyler
moore
which
folded
after
the
third
week
a
commonly
heard
criticism
of
the
show
was
less
mary
and
more
shawn
in
george
hamilton
recently
released
film
at
first
shawn
plays
the
role
of
lieutenant
ferguson
who
teams
up
with
a
psychiatrist
in
order
to
make
war
on
dracula
also
he
recently
played
the
lead
in
the
new
russell
coleman
musical
but
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
highlights
of
shawn
career
as
i
discover
in
an
interview
with
the
comedian
at
his
plush
upper
east
side
apartment
the
word
comedian
he
quickly
points
out
is
not
quite
accurate
i
think
of
myself
as
a
comedy
character
he
explains
relaxing
on
his
couch
with
a
plate
of
croissants
and
bacon
that
his
pretty
assistant
has
just
brought
him
in
i
played
seven
characters
they
ran
out
of
money
it
just
closed
out
of
town
it
needs
another
four
or
five
weeks
of
work
they
plan
to
bring
it
back
around
september
with
his
paunch
and
full
head
of
tousled
grey
hair
that
resembles
a
bird
nest
shawn
has
a
definite
comedic
look
about
him
but
he
seldom
smiles
and
never
laughs
during
our
long
conversation
still
his
answers
are
both
entertaining
and
revealing
on
mary
tyler
moore
variety
show
that
was
a
total
mistake
they
did
know
what
they
were
doing
there
i
thought
she
was
going
to
get
the
best
writers
and
the
best
producers
but
it
was
totally
inadequate
i
knew
from
the
very
first
day
that
it
was
going
to
work
the
whole
concept
was
wrong
variety
is
mary
forte
you
have
to
get
yourself
rolling
around
on
the
ground
a
little
bit
she
such
a
nice
sweet
girl
that
she
does
come
off
as
a
clown
the
basis
of
all
humor
believes
shawn
is
hostility
but
it
has
to
be
sweet
hostility
i
think
people
become
comedians
because
they
poke
fun
at
pretentiousness
they
usually
come
from
meager
backgrounds
and
then
they
can
look
up
and
see
the
pomposity
and
the
hypocrisy
of
many
human
beings
that
why
there
are
no
rich
comics
a
great
many
of
them
are
jewish
or
black
because
as
a
kid
they
were
told
they
were
part
of
a
minority
group
they
learned
to
have
a
sense
of
humor
about
themselves
they
had
to
in
order
to
survive
humor
is
their
way
of
getting
even
with
mankind
shawn
own
background
lends
credence
to
his
theory
born
richard
schulefand
in
the
steel
town
of
lackawanna
new
york
he
grew
up
in
a
family
that
was
by
the
depression
while
serving
with
the
army
following
world
war
ii
he
ended
up
in
an
entertainment
troupe
i
was
delighted
he
recalls
and
when
i
got
out
i
decided
to
pursue
it
in
the
early
he
secured
his
first
professional
engagement
as
a
comic
in
bayonne
new
jersey
and
was
paid
a
night
since
then
he
has
never
been
out
of
work
and
has
constantly
used
only
his
own
material
for
his
solo
act
songs
as
well
as
sketches
i
do
really
do
jokes
he
explains
i
do
situation
characters
although
the
thrust
of
my
humor
is
serious
i
have
always
taken
chances
in
my
club
act
for
example
i
always
ended
up
pretending
to
die
on
stage
rather
than
taking
bows
two
guys
would
come
with
a
stretcher
and
carry
me
out
among
his
more
memorable
performances
over
the
years
the
successor
to
zero
mostel
in
broadway
funny
thing
happened
on
the
way
to
the
the
freakishly
funny
beach
bum
in
the
stanley
kramer
film
a
mad
mad
mad
mad
and
a
cavorting
adolph
hitler
in
mel
brooks
zany
movie
still
no
project
has
gained
him
as
much
personal
satisfaction
as
second
greatest
entertainer
in
the
whole
wide
after
the
new
york
run
the
show
played
to
enthusiastic
audiences
in
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
and
earned
shawn
awards
for
both
best
performer
and
best
playwright
of
the
year
an
eastsider
for
the
past
seven
years
he
names
elaine
as
his
favorite
local
restaurant
because
the
food
is
good
and
there
a
simplicity
about
the
place
the
attracts
me
shawn
describes
himself
as
disciplined
but
not
as
disciplined
as
i
should
be
because
my
work
is
loose
i
always
adding
or
changing
nothing
ever
stays
the
same
but
comedy
is
a
very
rewarding
profession
it
nice
to
know
that
something
that
pops
into
your
head
can
cause
a
reaction
from
total
strangers
who
are
paying
you
money
to
be
entertained
i
think
the
ultimate

george
shearing
famed
jazz
pianist
returns
to
new
york
the
scene
was
a
boston
nightclub
in
the
early
george
shearing
and
his
quintet
were
scheduled
to
play
the
second
set
of
the
evening
the
opening
act
was
a
trio
but
as
soon
as
the
first
pianist
hit
the
keys
a
groan
went
up
from
the
audience
it
was
a
bad
box
as
they
said
in
those
days
the
management
promise
of
a
tuning
had
not
been
kept
the
trio
retired
in
defeat
minutes
later
and
the
audience
called
for
shearing
when
the
blind
pianist
was
led
on
stage
he
announced
to
everyone
astonishment
that
he
would
open
with
a
solo
but
when
he
sat
down
at
the
instruments
a
small
miracle
took
place
the
notes
rang
out
with
the
clarity
of
crystal
shearing
acute
ear
had
told
him
which
keys
to
avoid
and
the
precise
amount
of
pressure
to
apply
to
the
others
so
that
the
poor
tuning
would
be
camouflaged
those
who
were
present
to
witness
shearing
uncanny
musicianship
may
never
forget
the
experience
but
attending
any
of
his
performances
is
hardly
less
forgettable
he
now
playing
each
tuesday
through
saturday
evening
at
the
cafe
carlyle
street
and
madison
avenue
and
will
remain
there
until
march
his
famous
quintet
is
no
more
the
group
was
disbanded
in
after
years
but
shearing
accompanied
only
by
bass
player
brian
torff
proves
himself
a
master
showman
as
he
performs
his
unique
brand
of
jazz
tells
funny
stories
between
numbers
and
sings
in
his
lilting
playful
manner
i
on
the
road
about
months
a
year
he
told
the
carlyle
crowd
the
previous
night
when
i
went
there
to
catch
his
show
and
one
thing
i
can
not
tolerate
is
the
mediocrity
of
hotels
and
motels
in
this
country
once
on
my
second
morning
in
a
hotel
i
called
up
the
room
service
and
said
you
please
bring
me
some
breakfast
i
like
two
eggs
one
of
them
poached
and
the
other
scrambled
two
pieces
of
toast
one
barely
warm
and
the
other
burned
almost
to
a
crisp
and
a
pot
of
half
coffee
and
half
tea
the
person
on
the
other
end
said
sorry
sir
i
do
think
we
can
fill
that
order
i
said
not
that
what
you
brought
me
yesterday
the
next
afternoon
i
paid
shearing
a
visit
at
his
new
eastside
apartment
where
he
recently
moved
from
san
francisco
an
extremely
amiable
witty
and
knowledgeable
man
who
speaks
with
a
soft
british
accent
he
guided
me
around
the
large
tastefully
furnished
apartment
with
great
ease
showing
me
his
tape
collection
his
audio
calculator
and
his
braille
library
he
described
everything
from
the
drapes
to
the
furniture
as
if
he
had
perfect
vision
blind
since
birth
he
is
an
expert
bridge
player
and
a
fine
cook
i
just
started
to
take
cooking
lessons
said
shearing
stretched
out
n
the
sofa
with
a
smile
hovering
constantly
on
his
face
my
wife
and
i
are
taking
the
same
course
it
at
the
jewish
guild
for
the
blind
naturally
it
better
for
me
to
take
lessons
from
someone
who
knows
the
idiosyncracies
of
cooking
without
looking
i
very
interested
in
taste
if
i
were
to
cook
some
peas
for
example
i
would
be
inclined
to
line
the
saucepan
with
lettuce
and
add
a
little
sugar
and
mint
born
years
ago
in
london
the
ninth
child
of
a
coalman
he
began
plucking
out
radio
tunes
on
the
piano
at
the
age
of
and
by
his
early
was
considered
one
of
england
finest
jazz
pianists
he
moved
to
the
in
and
two
years
later
became
an
overnight
sensation
when
his
newly
formed
quintet
recorded
september
in
the
rain
which
sold
copies
to
date
shearing
has
recorded
more
than
albums
when
he
finally
broke
up
his
quintet
it
was
to
allow
himself
more
musical
freedom
his
playing
is
a
combination
of
jazz
classical
and
pop
that
calls
for
much
improvisation
his
most
famous
original
composition
lullaby
of
birdland
came
to
him
when
i
was
sitting
in
my
dining
room
in
new
jersey
eating
a
steak
it
took
me
only
minutes
to
write
it
i
went
back
to
that
butcher
several
times
afterwards
but
i
never
got
the
same
steak
a
popular
television
personality
shearing
has
appeared
on
all
the
major
tv
talk
shows
in
the
past
years
or
so
he
has
also
become
a
frequent
performer
with
symphony
orchestras
usually
playing
a
piano
concerto
in
the
first
half
of
the
program
and
a
jazz
piece
in
the
second
half
lionized
in
england
he
returned
to
london
last
december
and
played
a
sellout
concert
at
the
royal
albert
hall
new
york
is
where
his
american
career
began
and
he
decided
to
move
back
after
spending
years
on
the
west
coast
primarily
because
new
york
is
far
more
centrally
located
for
his
extensive
travelling
he
chose
the
upper
east
side
because
it
would
be
difficult
to
realize
we
in
the
heart
of
manhattan
it
so
quiet
here
no
sooner
did
he
speak
the
words
than
as
if
on
cue
a
baby
in
a
downstairs
apartment
began
to
cry
loudly
does
somebody
have
a
plastic
bag
he
deadpanned
one
of
shearing
main
interests
besides
music
bridge
and
cooking
is
business
law
he
once
took
a
course
on
the
subject
because
i
wanted
to
know
what
the
other
guy
rights
are
if
i
know
what
his
rights
are
i
know
what
mine
are
speaking
of
his
many
disappointments
in
hotels
and
motels
he
said
misrepresentation
and
false
advertising
can
be
beaten
at
any
time
anyone
wants
to
fight
it
i
have
never
lost
a
battle
on
this
score
yet
he
might
have
added
had
modesty
not
prevented
it
that
he
has
also
lost
no
battles
in
the
game
of
life

known
for
his
portrayal
of
powerful

statesmen
and

a
few
days
short
of

finally
leave
the
new

company
to
star
in

role
that
earned
him
a
tony
nomination
for
best
actor
i
had
two
vacations
and
i
missed
four
performances
in
almost
three
years
says
reid
in
his
dressing
room
on
a
recent
afternoon
easing
his
tall
bulky
frame
onto
a
sofa
he
immediately
reveals
a
personality
that
is
warm
and
eager
to
please
his
broad
features
give
distinction
to
his
gleaming
newly
shaved
head
reid
shaves
twice
a
day
with
an
electric
razor
my
understudy
plays
roosevelt
in
the
show
and
of
course
for
the
four
performances
that
he
had
to
go
on
for
me
he
did
shave
his
head
laughs
the
actor
i
gotten
the
most
angry
letters
from
people
saying
my
god
ca
you
at
least
have
the
understudy
shave
his
head
how
dare
you
do
that
to
us
asked
about
his
qualifications
for
playing
a
billionaire
reid
says
i
know
whether
it
my
look
personality
or
what
but
people
have
always
thought
that
i
come
from
money
actually
my
family
during
the
depression
was
very
poor
born
and
raised
in
salem
oregon
he
began
studying
voice
while
a
high
school
freshman
doing
chores
in
exchange
for
lessons
after
graduation
he
was
drafted
into
the
first
cavalry
division
of
the
army
fought
in
the
pacific
then
received
his
master
degree
in
voice
under
the
bill
arriving
in
new
york
city
in
he
got
a
job
singing
at
radio
city
music
hall
from
there
he
went
on
to
many
broadway
musicals
tv
shows
films
and
recordings
his
generous
income
from
enabled
him
last
year
to
purchase
the
westside
apartment
building
in
the
theater
district
where
he
been
living
since
it
a
building
with
apartment
units
this
last
year
i
lost
four
thousand
dollars
on
it
because
of
oil
and
everything
but
i
have
never
regretted
buying
it
some
stories
are
as
interesting
as
the
show
itself
yul
brynner
for
example
has
refused
to
be
photographed
with
shelton
maybe
he
afraid
if
the
strobes
hit
our
glistening
heads
simultaneously
there
will
be
no
picture
sandy
the
dog
was
discovered
in
an
animal
shelter
just
one
day
before
he
was
due
to
be
put
to
sleep
it
that
bored
quality
that
that
dog
has
says
reid
that
so
endearing
to
the
audience
he
lives
with
his
trainer
and
owner
bill
berloni
a
marvelous
young
chap
who
found
a
whole
new
career
for
himself
through
the
dog
and
when
the
subject
of
orphanages
comes
up
reid
tells
of
a
place
called
the
jennie
clarkson
home
in
valhalla
new
york
which
he
visited
not
long
ago
it
not
exactly
an
orphanage
but
a
temporary
home
for
girls
whose
families
ca
provide
for
them
they
have
about
girls
who
stay
in
cottages
with
cottage
parents
and
they
go
to
school
there
the
agency
works
with
the
family
by
trying
to
find
the
father
a
job
or
whatever
so
the
girls
can
finally
return
home
i
was
so
impressed
with
the
work
they
doing
i
trying
to
raise
money
for
it
he
recalls
visiting
the
white
house
to
do
a
shortened
version
of
for
the
carters
we
got
back
at
in
the
morning
totally
exhausted
but
the
whole
day
was
made
worthwhile
when
carter
sought
me
out
and
said
know
i
must
tell
you
how
much
i
appreciate
your
taking
your
day
off
to
come
down
here
and
do
this
for
us
it
must
be
a
real
chore
and
i
do
appreciate
it
it
was
just
a
wonderful
wonderful
personal
thing
that
she
did
have
to
do
it
something
i
will
always
treasure
on
another
occasion
says
reid
robert
wagner
and
natalie
wood
came
backstage
after
a
show
bobby
just
kept
crying
and
natalie
finally
said
god
sake
bob
stop
it
but
he
could
even
now
i
terribly
thrilled
when
people
come
back
and
say
made
me
cry
i
proud
of
that
if
i
can
touch
some
response
in
people
and
maybe
open
up
something
that
they
did
even
know
they
felt
that
a
tremendous
plus

every
word
and
every
note

out
a
finely
polished
jewel
leaving
the
audience
with
the
impression
that
they
have
never
heard

before
four
months
out
of
the
year

sets
aside
for

sometimes
taking
a
house
in

since
he
is
well
versed
in
the
french

of
gourmet
cooking
while
in

for
the

offers
me
from
a
crystal

and
i
begin
our
interview
by
asking
about
the

newport

festival
titled
a
to
black
broadway
it
will
take
place
in
avery
fisher

and
is
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
annual
jazz
festival
which
runs
from
june
to
july
it
the
chance
to
try
my
wings
at
something
new
says
the
jovial
musician
in
a
somewhat
gravelly
voice
marked
by
flawless
diction
also
it
a
chance
to
inform
i
suppose
i
a
frustrated
professor
of
sorts
this
show
is
a
way
of
stating
that
in
fact
there
were
blacks
involved
in
productions
on
broadway
as
far
back
as
perhaps
even
further
back
many
were
performers
who
wrote
their
own
material
others
were
composers
and
lyricists
whose
writing
was
not
confined
to
black
performers
some
of
them
wrote
for
the
ziegfeld
follies
as
with
robert
kimball
short
has
been
researching
material
to
find
out
what
good
what
bad
what
important
and
also
around
today
that
was
in
those
shows
among
the
performers
to
be
featured

but
i

more
sensible
over
the
years
i
no
longer
buy
all
i
can
get
my
hands
on
his
secret
for
staying
young
be
sensible
if
you
use
the
most
intimate
parts
of
your
body
to
make
a
living
like
your

i
do
for

muses
with
a
smile
it
never

or
get
out

very
social
person
and
i
like
people
i
understand
the
need
to
say
hello
to
someone
on
the
street
so
i
ca
knock
somebody
for
speaking
to
me
westsider
beverly
sills
opera
superstar
probably
no
opera
singer
since
caruso
has
made
so
great
an
impact
on
the
american
public
as
beverly
sills
even
today
the
mention
of
her
name
can
automatically
sell
out
a
concert
hall
anywhere
in
the
she
has
become
bigger
than
her
art
for
while
a
few
younger
singers
can
reach
the
notes
more
easily
sills
generates
a
certain
intense
excitement
into
all
her
roles
that
makes
every
show
she
appears
in
not
just
an
opera
but
an
event
her
star
vehicle
this
fall
is
an
early
opera
turco
in
the
turk
in
italy
written
by
gioacchino
rossini
prior
to
his
masterpiece
barber
of
presented
by
the
new
york
city
opera
for
eight
performances
in
september
through
november
is
a
subtle
comedy
about
a
flirtatious
sophia
character
sills
with
a
jealous
husband
the
audience
will
miss
none
of
the
italian
humor
because
this
production
of
is
in
english
i
love
to
do
english
translations
said
miss
sills
last
week
in
a
telephone
interview
i
believe
the
whole
art
of
opera
is
based
on
communication
i
do
see
how
people
can
appreciate
a
comedy
in
a
language
that
four
fifths
of
the
audience
does
understand
there
only
snobbery
about
foreign
languages
in
this
country
not
in
europe
in
america
an
opera
is
like
a
museum
piece
but
i
think
the
great
classics
like
and
do
need
to
be
translated
because
everyone
knows
what
they
about
she
performs
regularly
with
the
new
york
city
opera
even
though
the
state
company
is
able
to
pay
only
a
tiny
fraction
of
what
singers
receive
at
other
great
opera
houses
around
the
world
i
made
my
career
with
them
she
explained
i
sing
there
because
of
loyalty
and
because
i
love
to

already
made
plans

such
roles
as

dazzled
both

no

you
turned
down
i
tried
out
for
the
new

nine
times
before

auditions
themselves
are
valuable
they
give
you
the
experience
of
a
performance
george
singer
years
a
doorman
on
the
west
side
it
a
wet
stormy
night
on
the
west
side
rain
is
pelting
down
without
mercy
and
the
wind
is
whipping
along
the
edge
of
the
park
like
a
tornado
in
a
canyon
a
taxi
pulls
up
in
front
of
the
century
building
at
central
park
west
and
at
the
same
moment
a
man
in
uniform
emerges
from
the
building
holding
an
umbrella
to
escort
the
woman
passenger
to
safety
anyone
watching
the
scene
would
hardly
guess
that
the
doorman
is
years
old
but
his
age
is
not
the
only
remarkable
thing
about
george
singer
during
his
years
at
the
century
longer
than
any
other
employee
or
tenant
george
has
seen
the
entire
history
of
the
city
reflected
in
the
people
who
have
come
and
gone
through
the
entrance
he
has
gotten
to
know
celebrities
who
have
lived
in
the
building
and
has
met
countless
others
who
came
to
visit
from
prizefighters
to
presidents
he
has
watched
the
enormous
changes
of
fashion
custom
and
law
and
from
the
start
of
the
great
depression
to
the
beginning
of
the
koch
administration
george
has
remained
the
same
calm
observer
seeing
all
but
criticizing
no
one
i
been
here
since
this
was
a
hole

he

in

of
the

keeping
one
eye
on

it
all
started
in
when
they
tore
down
the
old
century
theatre
to
put
up
a
luxury
apartment
building
i
got
a
job
as
a
plumber
helper
lugging
big
pipes
across
the
ground
after
it
was
finished
in
i
went
to
the
superintendent
and
told
him
i
helped
build
the
century
and
asked
for
a
job
i
simply
had
to
get
work
because
it
was
during
the
depression
and
i
had
my
wife
and
two
kids
i
started
as
an
elevator
man
and
i
worked

they
have
seven
grandchildren
and
one
great

george
could
easily
afford
to
retire
in
fact
he
is
sometimes
jokingly
referred
to
as
the
richest
man
in
the
building
but
he
chooses
to
keep
working
why
not
work
till
or
if
you
able
he
says
i
think
it
good
for
a
person
chanin
who
owns
this
building
in
his
and
he
goes
to
work
most
every
day
george
continues
to
do
the
night
shift
as
he
always
has
i
rather
work
nights
there
more
money
at
nights
and
you
do
have
the
bosses
around
at
night
people
are
more
in
a
free
spirit
how
does
george
explain
his
continued
success
and
good
health
does
he
have
a
secret
he
would
like
to
pass
on
i
smoke
two
cigars
a
day
he
answers
immediately
with
a
gleam
in
his
eye
that
keeps
the
cold
germs
away
i
never
catch
cold
it
the
best
medicine
in
the
world
is
george
looking
forward
to
christmas
are
all
doormen
westsider
gregg
smith
founder
and
conductor
of
the
gregg
smith
singers
what
might
you
guess
about
a
man
who
has
composed
major
choral
works
toured
the
world
with
his
singing
group
and
recorded
albums
including
three
grammy
award
winners
if
you
did
know
anything
else
about
this
man
you
would
probably
guess
first
that
he
is
rich
then
you
might
imagine
that
his
door
is
constantly
bombarded
by
recording
agents
trying
to
enlist
his
talents
and
third
you
would
probably
think
that
his
name
is
a
household
word
but
westsider
gregg
smith
has
all
of
the
qualifications
listed
and
none
of
the
imagined
results
this
is
because
his
music
happens
to
be
classical
a
field
in
which
he
says
a
record
that
sells
copies
is
considered
a
good
hit
conducting
his
choral
group
the
gregg
smith
singers
who
usually
have
anywhere
from
to
voices
he
performs
works
spanning
the
last
four
centuries
of
the
western
classical
tradition
gregg
writes
most
of
the
arrangements
himself
last
year
his
sheet
music
sales
reached
copies
the
gregg
smith
singers
specialize
in
pieces
that
have
been
infrequently
performed
or
recorded
but
a
more
lengthy
description
of
their
music
can
only
tell
what
it
is
not
how
it
sounds
music
speaks
for
itself
better
than
any
words
can
describe
none
of
the
american
composers
of
today
are
making
a
living
says
gregg
shaking
his
head
we
sitting
in
his
spacious
but
unluxurious
apartment
near
lincoln
center
it
a
terrible
struggle
when
people
talk
about
ghetto
areas
let
me
tell
you
no
one
is
more
in
a
ghetto
than
the
american
classical
composer
we
have
more
great
composers
in
this
country
right
now
than
any
other
country
in
the
word
and
the
united
states
supports
its
composers
less
than
any
other
country
they
want
so
desperately
to
perform
their
music
a
composer
does
a
piece
and
gets
a
performance
in
new
york
and
that
may
be
the
last
performance
it
ever
gets
he
leads
me
to
a
room
lined
with
shelves
boxes
and
cabinets
filled
with
sheet
music
some
of
it
in
manuscript
this
is
where
gregg
chooses
each
new
selection
for
his
group
he
shrugs
at
the
enormity
of
the
task
there
are
at
least
new
american
compositions
here
waiting
to
be
looked
at
probably
at
least
of
them
are
of
the
highest
quality
when
we
record
this
type
of
material
we
do
expect
to
make
a
profit
even
with
the
royalties
over
the
years
classical
records
are
made
because
the
music
needs
to
be
heard
it
a
second
form
of
publication
we
do
it
as
a
means
of
getting
this
music
out
the
same
economic
rule
holds
true
when
the
singers
do
a
concert
because
of
the
large
size
of
the
group
and
the
vast
amount
of
rehearsal
time
needed
to
perfect
new
works
or
new
arrangements
the
box
office
receipts
do
come
close
to
meeting
the
expenses
the
grants
they
receive
from
the
national
endowment
for
the
arts
and
the
new
york
state
council
for
the
arts
are
not
always
sufficient
like
every
one
of
the
arts
it
a
constant
deficit
operation
at
this
point
we
not
nearly
as
strong
in
as
in
the
other
aspects
in
spite
of
the
financial
pressures
gregg
does
manage
to
provide
his
singers
with
about
weeks
of
work
per
year
his
group
has
gone
on
a
national
tour
for
consecutive
years
so
far
the
singers
have
performed
in
every
state
except
alaska
they
have
made
four
tours
of
europe
and
one
of
the
far
east
their
typical
new
york
season
included
four
concerts
at
alice
tully
hall
and
a
contemporary
music
festival
in
one
of
the
local
churches
this
year
the
festival
will
be
held
in
peter
church
located
in
the
citicorp
center
starting
on
april
a
native
of
chicago
gregg
attended
college
in
los
angeles
and
founded
the
gregg
smith
singers
there
in
his
talent
as
a
conductor
and
arranger
soon
came
to
the
attention
of
the
late
igor
stravinsky
the
composer
who
was
then
living
in
california
the
pair
eventually
recorded
more
than
a
dozen
albums
together
when
stravinsky
died
in
gregg
was
invited
to
venice
italy
to
prepare
the
chorus
and
orchestra
for
the
rites
in
honor
of
the
late
maestro
in
all
his
travels
gregg
and
his
wife
rosalind
have
found
no
place
where
they
would
feel
so
much
at
home
as
the
west
side
it
a
great
wonderful
community
for
the
classical
musician
he
says
it
one
of
the
most
vibrant
alive
sometimes
terrifying
but
always
exciting
places
to
live
perhaps
gregg
rarest
quality
is
his
unselfishness
toward
other
american
composers
his
biggest
concern
seems
to
be
how
will
be
manage
to
get
all
their
works
recorded
i
have
enough
important
recordings
to
do
he
says
in
a
voice
hovering
between
joy
and
frustration
to
keep
me
busy
for
five
years
that
would
mean
literally
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
the
money
may
come
or
it
may
not
but
the
worth
of
gregg
smith
gentleman
artist
is
beyond
price
eastsider
liz
smith
queen
of
gossip
like
most
of
the
kids
she
grew
up
with
in
fort
worth
texas
during
the
great
depression
liz
smith
was
by
the
movies
they
told
me
there
was
a
whole
world
out
there
where
people
were
glamorous
where
men
and
women
drank
wine
with
dinner
and
wore
white
tie
and
tails
and
drove
cars
with
the
tops
down
and
danced
on
glass
floors
she
recalls
smiling
dreamily
her
soft
languid
accent
dripping
with
southern
charm
echoes
through
the
coffee
shop
at
the
nbc
building
in
midtown
despite
her
cordiality
she
somehow
gives
the
impression
of
being
in
a
great
hurry
and
for
good
reason
smith
is
probably
the
and
certainly
the
most
successful
gossip
writer
on
the
east
coast
unlike
rona
barrett
the
queen
of
hollywood
gossip
liz
smith
does
not
have
a
large
staff
but
relies
on
a
single
assistant
and
leg
man
in
california
nevertheless
she
manages
to
turn
out
each
week
six
columns
for
the
york
daily
syndicated
nationally
to
more
than
newspapers
five
radio
spots
for
nbc
and
two
television
spots
for
wnbc
the
minute
i
get
up
i
go
to
work
i
get
up
at
about
nine
and
go
right
to
work
says
liz
i
look
at
the
paper
right
quick
and
go
right
to
the
typewriter
and
work
till
i
finish
the
column
at
one
i
work
in
my
apartment
because
i
would
never
have
time
to
get
up
and
dress
and
go
to
another
place
i
would
never
get
to
meet
my
deadline
i
work
all
the
time
i
work
a
lot
on
the
weekends
because
that
the
only
time
i
can
even
vaguely
make
a
stab
at
catching
up
i
just
about
kill
myself
to
get
everything
done
i
do
know
if
it
worth
it
for
all
her
complaints
liz
believes
that
is
well
suited
for
her
personality
i
ca
help
it
i
just
one
of
those
people
who
likes
to
repeat
a
tale
she
explains
i
be
reading
every
newspaper
in
america
that
i
could
get
my
hands
on
and
every
book
and
magazine
anyway
even
if
i
were
doing
this
job
when
she
was
hired
by
the
in
february
to
start
her
column
liz
was
no
stranger
to
the
new
york
celebrity
scene
she
had
already
been
in
the
city
for
years
working
mainly
as
a
writer
i
made
a
lot
of
money
even
years
ago
i
never
made
less
than
a
year
besides
writing
for
virtually
every
mass
market
publication
in
america
she
spent
five
years
ghostwriting
the
cholly
knickerbocker
society
column
in
the
old
her
many
contacts
among
the
famous
and
the
resurgence
of
interest
in
gossip
also
helped
persuade
editor
mike
that
the
paper
could
use
a
gossip
column
in
which
the
personality
of
the
writer
came
through
within
weeks
of
her
debut
liz
broke
some
of
the
sensational
details
of
woodward
and
bernstein
final
which
was
about
to
be
excerpted
in
she
added
the
tv
and
radio
broadcasts
to
her
schedule
in
and
avoids
duplicating
items
whenever
possible
her
best
sources
says
liz
are
other
journalists
because
they
know
what
stories
are
i
know
a
lot
of
very
serious
and
important
writers
who
have
a
lot
of
news
and
gossip
and
rumors
and
stuff
that
they
do
have
any
place
to
put
so
they
apt
to
give
it
to
me
they
have
impulses
to
disseminate
news
i
think
real
reporters
do
feel
that
way
liz
says
that
generally
speaking
she
prefers
writers
to
all
other
people
asked
to
name
some
favorites
she
bubblingly
replies
norman
mailer
i
just
think
norman
is
a
genius
oh
god
i
love
so
many
writers
my
favorite
novel
recently
was
peter
maas
book
in
there
tommy
thompson
who
just
wrote
nora
ephrom
carl
bernstein
are
friends
of
mine
norman
mailer
is
a
friend
of
mine
oh
i
could
go
on
forever
an
author
in
her
own
right
liz
wrote
mother
two
years
ago
it
sold
approximately
copies
in
hardcover
and
in
paperback
it
kind
of
wrote
itself
she
says
modestly
of
the
acclaimed
collection
of
anecdotes
about
mothers
someday
she
would
like
to
try
fiction
at
present
she
is
working
on
a
book
that
she
describes
as
a
history
and
philosophy
of
gossip
and
what
it
is
and
what
it
all
about
an
eastsider
for
half
her
life
liz
says
her
neighborhood
has
the
lowest
crime
rate
of
any
police
district
in
new
york
most
of
the
restaurants
he
frequents
are
on
the
upper
east
side
they
include
le
plaisir
gian
marino
szechuan
east
and
elaine
for
years
she
saw
her
therapist
at
least
once
a
week
now
she
pays
him
just
occasional
visits
it
helped
me
enormously
in
writing
i
quit
having
writer
block
i
quit
putting
things
off
i
quit
making
myself
miserable
i
accepted
my
success
which
was
hard
because
a
lot
of
writers
they
do
want
to
succeed
they
do
think
they
deserve
it
it
like
people
who
do
want
to
be
happy
well
i
mean
you
can
be
happy
you
know
if
you
let
yourself
and
if
you
do
your
work
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
i
think
is
to
do
your
work
if
you
do
your
work
you
be
happy
i
almost
positive
about
it
eastsiders
tom
dick
smothers
stars
of
love
my
on
broadway
as
the
smothers
brothers
they
were
perhaps
the
funniest
most
original
american
music
and
comedy
team
to
come
out
of
the
their
albums
sold
in
the
millions
and
for
three
seasons
they
had
the
most
controversial
show
on
television
smothers
brothers
comedy
when
cbs
abruptly
canceled
their
contract
in
for
seemingly
political
reasons
they
became
a
cause
celebre
by
suing
the
network
and
winning
a
million
dollars
in
damages
after
years
of
performing
together
as
a
team
they
retired
their
act
in
december
saying
that
their
brand
of
satire
had
been
stated
and
that
repetition
would
bore
them
the
brothers
parted
on
friendly
terms
each
determined
to
make
his
mark
separately
as
an
entertainer
this
past
labor
day
they
were
reunited
as
a
comedy
team
not
on
television
or
in
a
nightclub
but
on
the
stage
of
the
ethel
barrymore
theatre
on
west
street
where
they
instantly
breathed
new
life
into
the
musical
love
my
cast
in
the
roles
of
two
wife
swappers
from
trenton
new
jersey
they
insisted
on
being
billed
not
as
the
smothers
brothers
but
as
dick
and
tom
smothers
however
anyone
who
laments
the
demise
of
the
smothers
brothers
act
should
catch
the
show
before
the
contract
runs
out
on
march
dick
smothers
as
wally
a
and
tom
smothers
as
his
naive
bumbling
friend
alvin
a
moving
man
wear
their
roles
as
if
they
had
been
written
for
no
one
else
i
like
theatre
and
i
going
to
do
more
of
it
said
tom
during
a
recent
dressing
room
interview
after
a
matinee
performance
his
brother
dick
had
other
plans
as
soon
as
this
show
is
over
i
have
to
go
back
to
california
and
do
some
bottling
for
my
winery
and
i
want
to
do
more
auto
racing
i
race
for
american
motors
as
far
as
making
a
career
in
acting
on
broadway
no
i
think
i
could
work
at
it
and
become
a
fairly
decent
actor
but
while
i
making
wine
i
want
to
play
in
cabaret
theatre
and
dinner
theatre
it
fun
and
it
keeps
you
sharp
broadway
is
a
place
you
should
learn
what
we
doing
is
apprenticing
on
broadway
but
that
how
we
got
our
television
show
protested
tom
we
never
done
a
television
show
before
in
spite
of
the
box
office
success
of
their
broadway
debut
dick
can
not
help
feeling
disappointed
that
as
always
he
is
cast
as
the
straight
man
his
character
wally
is
a
foil
to
the
lovable
alvin
not
a
whole
lot
to
do
with
wally
said
dick
pouring
me
a
glass
of
his
smothers
white
riesling
wine
the
fact
is
everyone
is
pretty
locked
in
except
for
alvin
we
all
dancing
around
him
tom
only
complaint
about
the
show
is
that
it
has
put
a
strain
on
his
health
and
especially
on
his
throat
this
is
the
first
time
i
been
close
to
the
edge
of
anxiety
healthwise
he
confided
sipping
hot
tea
with
lemon
as
soon
as
i
arrived
n
new
york
i
got
tonsillitis
now
i
have
insomnia
antibiotics
really
drain
your
body
i
lost
pounds
so
far
it
a
very
demanding
part
physically
both
brothers
seemed
very
serious
offstage
although
tom
went
through
his
full
range
of
marvelous
mug
expressions
as
he
answered
the
questions
and
posed
for
photos
asked
about
how
his
current
salary
compares
to
what
he
has
earned
previously
he
replied
broadway
you
do
for
love
of
the
craft
the
money
is
nothing
to
what
you
can
make
in
film
you
do
it
because
not
many
actors
can
do
theatre
dick
commented
some
of
the
big
stars
in
las
vegas
get
to
times
what
we
making
it
the
prestige
and
the
experience
tom
and
dick
were
born
on
governor
island
in
new
york
harbor
their
father
an
army
major
died
in
the
philippines
near
the
end
of
world
war
ii
their
mother
then
took
them
to
the
west
coast
and
when
tom
was
she
gave
him
a
guitar
i
wanted
to
be
a
bandleader
first
then
a
comedian
he
recalled
at
san
jose
state
i
was
in
a
trio
and
we
needed
a
tenor
so
i
got
dickie
to
come
to
school
while
still
in
college
they
played
their
first
professional
engagement
as
the
smothers
brothers
at
san
francisco
purple
onion
nightclub
and
got
four
encores
before
long
jack
paar
invited
them
on
tonight
and
their
career
was
assured
one
thing
that
is
particularly
touching
about
tom
and
dick
smothers
is
the
great
affection
they
have
for
each
other
they
live
in
separate
upper
east
side
apartments
about
a
mile
apart
but
dick
drives
tom
to
the
theatre
each
day
and
they
frequently
socialize
together
tom
mind
is
currently
on
a
farce
but
the
which
he
plans
to
start
rehearsing
this
fall
and
hopes
to
eventually
bring
to
broadway
dick
meanwhile
is
thinking
more
about
the
jeep
he
recently
won
in
a
celebrity
auto
race
i
going
to
drive
it
home
to
santa
cruz
he
commented
with
obvious
satisfaction
it
has
drive
bush
guards
a
roll
bar
and
heavy
tires
it
perfect
for
manhattan
westsider
victor
temkin
publisher
of
berkley
and
jove
books
victor
temkin
who
looks
like
a
character
out
of
dickens
and
comes
across
with
the
gruff
friendliness
of
television
ed
asner
is
sitting
in
his
midtown
office
on
friday
afternoon
trying
to
deal
with
three
things
at
once
the
telephone
is
jangling
visitors
are
dropping
by
unannounced
and
i
throwing
him
questions
about
the
publishing
business
what
complicates
matters
is
that
temkin
is
in
the
process
of
moving
his
offices
to
another
floor
has
ad
and
his
staff
of
are
packing
everything
into
cardboard
boxes
and
now
it
impossible
to
find
anything
but
the
short
man
with
spectacles
takes
it
all
in
stride
he
lights
a
lucky
strike
props
one
hand
against
his
chin
and
explains
how
he
got
to
be
the
head
of
berkley
books
which
has
long
been
the
paperback
division
of
putnam
i
came
to
new
york
in
as
a
lawyer
i
became
assistant
attorney
in
i
stayed
there
till
he
relates
in
short
bursts
of
speech
then
i
went
into
private
practice
until
september
of
when
i
got
into
the
book
business
i
became
house
counsel
at
bantam
books
and
worked
my
way
up
and
later
became
a
vice
president
i
came
here
in
july
of
as
president
and
chief
executive
officer
since
that
time
we
purchased
jove
books
from
harcourt
brace
jovanovich
it
another
paperback
house
berkley
does
largely
reprints
of
hardcovers
but
jove
does
exclusively
paperback
originals
together
the
two
companies
put
out
about
or
books
a
year
of
these
are
from
jove
berkley
books
he
admits
is
one
of
the
smaller
paperback
houses
perhaps
sixth
or
seventh
but
the
company
manages
to
get
its
share
of
at
new
year
two
were
in
the
nation
top
by
christina
crawford
and
by
peggy
anderson
says
temkin
is
the
first
time
we
had
a
story
of
child
abuse
at
that
level
off
society
which
i
think
is
a
great
thing
for
the
people
to
read
it
is
only
poor
kids
that
get
beat
up
it
the
rich
kids
too
just
as
badly
in
terms
of
sales
and
profits
he
says
there
no
such
thing
as
an
average
book
it
depends
on
what
you
pay
for
the
advance
and
what
the
cost
of
manufacturing
the
book
is
i
can
have
books
sell
copies
and
make
a
profit
or
i
can
have
books
sell
a
million
copies
and
lose
money
it
not
hard
to
spend
a
million
dollars
on
a
book
that
easy
to
do
the
hard
thing
is
to
find
a
book
like
where
you
pay
the
million
for
it
and
you
can
sell
a
million
and
a
half
we
jumped
in
and
bought
it
early
on
before
it
was
a
hardcover
berkley
hottest
author
at
present
is
john
jakes
whose
kent
family
saga
has
sold
million
copies
jakes
new
book
is
scheduled
to
be
out
in
february
the
first
printing
is
over
three
million
copies
says
temkin
we
expect
it
to
be
a
number
one
what
a
great
success
story
john
has
been
around
for
many
many
years
and
he
written
a
lot
of
books
but
he
never
had
the
commercial
success
until
that
came
along
you
can
never
tell
in
this
business
that
why
we
in
it
you
do
know
what
tomorrow
going
to
be
temkin
who
anticipates
losing
money
on
seven
out
of
books
he
publishes
does
frequently
travels
around
the
country
on
business
and
makes
it
a
point
to
observe
what
people
are
reading
on
buses
and
in
bookstores
i
think
kids
today
are
coming
back
to
books
because
it
the
best
form
of
entertainment
there
is
for
the
money
he
says
i
read
a
lot
i
try
to
read
two
three
books
a
week
i
have
a
rule
that
i
do
read
books
by
authors
who
are
friends
of
mine
that
i
am
publishing
because
i
know
it
will
be
nothing
but
trouble
i
ca
tell
them
i
do
like
a
book
and
if
i
tell
them
i
do
like
it
they
may
not
believe
me
but
i
like
writers
i
enjoy
being
around
them

laughs
when
asked
whether

been
helpful
in
his

now
i
may
not
be
that
way
a
lot
of
my
friends
are
afraid
i
gone
too
far
too
fast
during
the
first
years
of
his
life
when
he
lived
in
garden
city
long
island
john
was
a
top
student
a
star
athlete
and
a
fine
musician
after
graduating
from
high
school
he
left
for
north
carolina
to
attend
the
state
university
on
a
soccer
scholarship
his
goal
to
become
a
doctor
but
when
john
returned
to
the
new
york
area
in
at
the
age
of
it
was
not
as
a
professional
athlete
or
a
physician
but
as
a
television
news
reporter
today
at
he
is
one
of
the
most
highly
respected
young
broadcasters
in
new
york
throughout
the
week
he
appears
regularly
on
channel
news
as
an
reporter
and
each
saturday
and
sunday
he
both
the
and
the
evening
news
according
to
tesh
his
weekend
show
is
watched
by
more
people
than
any
other
local
news
program
in
new
york
as
if
this
job
were
not
enough
last
september
john
opened
his
own
sporting
goods
store
sports
stripes
located
on
columbus
avenue
at
street
a
few
blocks
from
his
apartment
the
compact
brightly
decorated
store
specializes
in
running
equipment
and
is
the
only
place
in
new
york
city
where
running
shoes
can
be
resoled
on
the
premises
when
i
stop
by
sports
stripes
one
afternoon
to
talk
with
john
over
lunch
the
first
thing
i
notice
is
his
sheer
size
at
foot
and
pounds
he
makes
a
commanding
presence
there
is
command
in
his
voice
as
well
it
is
as
deep
and
rich
as
a
russian
he
seems
extraordinarily
calm
and
when
i
comment
on
this
he
says
that
not
as
much
pressure
in
new
york
as
there
was
then
i
worked
in
north
carolina
here
you
able
to
concentrate
solely
on
your
reporting
there
you
were
concerned
with
logistical
problems
shooting
the
film
developing
it
editing
it
selecting
slides
producing
the
broadcast
and
then
anchoring
it
but
i
not
as
calm
as
i
might
appear
i
think
people
at
sports
stripes
and
cbs
think
of
me
as
frenetic
his
entry
into
broadcasting
was
totally
unplanned
halfway
through
college
he
got
a
job
as
a
copy
boy
at
a
local
radio
station
one
day
the
station
two
newsmen
called
in
sick
and
john
was
asked
to
fill
in
instantly
bitten
by
the
broadcast
journalism
bug
he
decided
to
trade
in
his
premed
courses
for
production
and
political
science
when
i
finished
college
says
john
in
his
manner
i
had
the
choice
of
going
to
medical
school
or
continuing
in
broadcasting
so
i
felt
l
could
go
either
way
i
decided
to
stay
in
broadcasting
for
a
while
after
working
at
television
stations
in
north
carolina
florida
and
tennessee
he
was
offered
a
job
at
wcbs
i
would
say
that
most
correspondents
try
to
get
to
new
york
because
the
production
is
a
lot
better
here
i
would
like
the
anchor
job
without
the
field
work
he
adds
thoughtfully
i
have
been
told
that
my
forte
is
breaking
news
last
year
i
won
an
emmy
for
that
the
same
year
i
won
an
emmy
for
outstanding
reporting
unedited
live
television
is
what
it
coming
to
it
interesting
because
it
come
full
circle
at
one
time
everything
was
live
then
for
some
reason
it
went
so
heavily
into
tape
and
now
it
back
into
live
journalism
as
the
public
becomes
better
informed
so
changes
the
news
when
fred
cowan
was
holed
up
in
a
warehouse
in
new
rochelle
and
he
had
killed
at
least
one
police
officer
and
was
holding
several
hostages
i
was
in
a
house
across
the
street
from
there
we
were
reporting
as
it
was
happening
there
were
shots
fired
i
did
realize
until
afterwards
how
intense
it
was
asked
about
which
skills
are
required
for
live
journalism
john
says
i
think
it
being
able
to
explain
quickly
and
concisely
the
situation
at
hand
without
becoming
too
involved
in
the
situation
becoming
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
viewer
being
able
to
is
actually
what
it
is
walter
cronkite
is
one
of
the
great
a
bachelor
who
lives
alone
john
still
finds
time
for
sports
and
music
i
get
enough
excitement
out
of
the
store
and
work
so
that
when
it
time
to
go
home
i
like
to
be
quiet
i
have
an
electric
piano
which
i
play
with
headsets
i
run
two
marathons
here
in
new
york
i
too
big
to
be
a
good
marathon
runner
but
i
do
train
hard
my
ambition
is
to
find
some
race
to
win
john
says
he
likes
the
west
side
to
much
that
my
friends
have
to
drag
me
to
the
east
side
i
do
all
my
shopping
on
the
west
side
because
i
figure
why
should
i
help
out
my
friends
who
live
here
by
shopping
at
their
stores
when
john
decided
to
open
his
own
store
he
called
up
his
boyhood
friend
paul
abbott
to
run
it
the
pair
were
classmates
from
grammar
school
through
high
school
john
says
he
hopes
to
eventually
open
his
own
seafood
restaurant
on
the
west
side
of
course
this
is
where
i
plan
to
live
for
the
rest
of
my
life
westsider
richard
thomas
teams
up
with
henry
fonda
in
seven
years
ago
on
christmas
day
cbs
aired
a
holiday
program
titled
about
a
family
living
in
appalachia
during
the
great
depression
all
who
were
involved
in
the
project
went
their
separate
ways
after
the
filming
including
a
young
actor
from
the
upper
west
side
named
richard
thomas
but
it
drew
such
a
favorable
response
that
cbs
decided
to
turn
it
into
a
series
the
rest
is
history
became
a
hit
and
made
thomas
a
television
superstar
for
five
years
he
charmed
his
way
into
american
homes
as
the
beloved
john
boy
then
in
he
decided
to
leave
in
order
to
concentrate
on
his
marriage
write
poetry
do
stage
acting
perform
ballet
and
make
movies
on
february
in
what
is
certain
to
be
his
most
closely
watched
performance
to
date
richard
will
star
in
the
first
segment
of
abcs
playing
the
son
of
a
wealthy
railroad
lawyer
henry
fonda
who
marries
a
black
schoolteacher
he
will
appear
to
a
lesser
extent
on
the
two
following
evenings
as
well
before
leaving
the
scene
as
a
man
in
an
interview
at
the
new
york
school
of
ballet
at
broadway
and
street
which
is
owned
by
his
parents
richard
thomas
iii
and
barbara
fallis
he
talks
enthusiastically
about
his
role
in
roots
ii
my
character
is
an
actual
historical
figure
says
richard
he
had
just
come
back
from
college
and
did
know
what
he
wanted
out
of
life
obviously
in
or
his
marriage
was
considered
a
disaster
his
wife
carrie
was
alex
haley
first
teacher
her
school
is
still
in
tennessee
today
sporting
a
newly
grown
moustache
casually
dressed
and
still
boyish
looking
at
richard
carries
an
air
of
tremendous
confidence
about
him
yet
his
voice
changes
to
one
of
awed
respect
when
he
speaks
of
henry
fonda
the
thing
about
working
with
someone
like
fonda
is
that
his
presence
is
so
strongly
felt
that
you
get
caught
up
in
watching
him
really
uncanny
i
had
to
pinch
myself
to
get
back
into
the
scene
and
olivia
de
havilland

plays
my
mother
she
extraordinary

it
like
the
back
of
my
hand

says

whenever

very
blue

to
watch
what

in
the
young

down
to

he
also
plays
the
dulcimer
when
i
go
to
kentucky
this
week
going
to
call
on
a
man
who
one
of
the
great
dulcimer
makers
in
the
united
states
the
mountain
instrument
an
important
component
in
the
folk
music
of
appalachia
caught
richard
fancy
long
ago
during
a
visit
to
his
grandfather
kentucky
farm
where
he
spent
many
summers
as
a
boy
both
of
his
grandparents
on
his
father
side
are
still
living
like
an
episode
from
the
family
often
gathers
at
the
farm
on
thanksgiving
day
the
original
was
seen
by
more
people
than
any
other
program
in
the
history
of
television
but
richard
does
not
dwell
on
his
important
role
in
he
prefers
to
talk
about
the
fulfillment
he
has
found
in
marriage
i
ca
imagine
not
being
married
at
this
point
he
says
the
thick
gold
band
gleaming
on
his
finger
if
my
marriage
were
happy
i
make
the
right
kind
of
career
decisions
one
supports
the
other
part
of
the
same
package
does
he
expect
to
have
more
children
richard
smiles
broadly
and
replies
that
really
my
wife
department
eastsider
andy
warhol
pop
artist
and
publisher
of
magazine
he
is
the
great
enigma
of
american
art
some
of
his
most
famous
paintings
are
exercises
in
monotony
his
movies
often
put
the
viewer
to
sleep
as
a
conversationalist
he
can
be
to
the
point
of
dullness
speaking
softly
in
a
emotionless
voice
he
relies
heavily
on
short
sentences
long
pauses
and
an
abundance
of
ums
and
uhs
however
he
has
one
asset
that
overshadows
everything
negative
that
might
be
said
or
written
about
him
his
name
happens
to
be
andy
warhol
the
only
time
i
met
warhol
in
person
was
at
a
book
publication
party
several
months
ago
he
came
by
himself
spoke
to
hardly
anyone
and
spent
most
of
his
brief
visit
flitting
quietly
about
the
room
avoiding
people
eyes
and
taking
snapshots
of
the
more
celebrated
guests
with
his
pale
complexion
narrow
frame
and
hair
like
bleached
straw
he
looked
not
unlike
a
scarecrow
everywhere
he
went
heads
turned
to
catch
a
glimpse
that
has
been
the
story
of
warhol
life
ever
since
he
rose
to
international
prominence
in
the
although
he
did
not
feel
like
talking
when
i
met
him
andy
never
agreed
to
a
telephone
interview
at
a
later
date
reached
at
the
offices
of
his
magazine
off
union
square
he
answered
all
my
questions
briefly
and
in
a
voice
so
low
that
he
could
barely
be
heard
the
monthly
magazine
that
he
publishes
is
warhol
most
visible
creative
project
at
the
moment
it
been
going
for
about
seven
or
eight
years
he
said
i
started
it
for
brigid
berlin
her
father
ran
the
hearst
corporation
she
did
want
to
work
on
it
the
person
on
the
cover
of
each
issue
is
identified
only
on
the
inside
and
many
of
the
faces
are
difficult
to
recognize
some
are
genuine
celebrities
such
as
truman
capote
who
has
a
regular
column
others
are
young
unknowns
who
have
caught
warhol
fancy
the
ultramodern
layout
includes
many
ads
for
some
of
the
most
expensive
shops
in
manhattan
the
interviews
interspersed
with
many
photos
lean
heavily
on
show
business
personalities
models
artists
writers
and
fashion
people
in
most
cases
the
interviews
are
actually
group
discussions
often
with
andy
himself
taking
part
that
are
printed
verbatim
even
the
most
mundane
comments
are
not
cut
the
reason
i
used
to
carry
a
tape
recorder
with
me
all
the
time
so
this
was
a
way
to
use
it
said
warhol
but
in
truth
the
literal
transcriptions
are
another
example
of
the
naturalism
that
characterizes
much
of
his
work
when
he
turned
his
attention
from
painting
and
drawing
to
filmmaking
in
he
became
notorious
for
such
movies
as
which
showed
a
man
sleeping
for
six
hours
and
which
he
made
by
aiming
his
camera
at
the
empire
state
building
and
keeping
the
film
running
for
eight
straight
hours
according
to
warhol
many
people
have
turned
down
his
request
for
interviews
it
hard
to
get
robert
redford
we
choose
people
who
like
to
talk
a
lot
the
type
of
reader
he
seeks
to
attract
is
the
rich
audience
people
who
go
to
places
like
christie
and
fiorucci
fun
to
go
to
those
places
and
get
invited
to
parties
i
love
fashion
parties
shoe
parties
are
even
better
his
affection
for
shoes
dates
back
to
when
in
his
first
year
in
new
york
he
got
a
job
in
the
art
department
of
a
shoe
store
his
designs
and
magazine
illustrations
caught
on
so
fast
that
within
a
year
he
was
able
to
purchase
the
town
house
on
the
upper
east
side
where
he
still
lives
with
his
mother
but
mostly
i
live
with
my
two
dachshunds
they
taken
over
certain
facts
abut
andy
warhol
early
life
remain
a
mystery
because
he
has
always
objected
to
questions
that
he
considers
irrelevant
to
an
understanding
of
him
as
an
artist
it
is
known
that
he
was
born
somewhere
in
pennsylvania
sometime
between
and
to
a
family
of
immigrants
from
czechoslovakia
named
warhola
by
his
warhol
was
one
of
the
most
commercial
artists
in
the
field
his
prints
of
campbell
soup
cans
made
him
famous
with
the
general
public
and
by
the
he
was
clearly
the
most
highly
celebrated
plastic
artist
a
title
he
relishes
in
the
world
in
recent
years
his
creative
output
has
been
reduced
somewhat
as
the
result
of
the
severe
wounds
he
sustained
in
june
when
a
deranged
woman
shot
him
in
his
office
nevertheless
he
continues
to
mount
gallery
exhibitions
write
books
and
paint
portraits
the
whitney
museum
at
madison
will
have
a
show
of
his
portraits
in
december
asked
about
the
east
side
warhol
said
that
one
of
his
favorite
activities
is
to
go
window
shopping
when
you
live
on
the
east
side
you
have
to
go
far
because
usually
everything
happens
here
when
he
goes
to
the
west
side
it
often
to
visit
studio
i
only
go
there
to
see
my
friend
steve
rubell
afterwards
we
usually
go
to
cowboys
and
cowgirls
about
the
only
medium
that
warhol
has
not
worked
in
is
television
oh
i
always
wanted
to
yeah
was
his
parting
comment
it
just
never
happens
the

in
a
dark
suit
with
a
white
carnation
in
his
buttonhole
to
match
his
white
mustache
weissberger
looks
very
much
like
the
stereotype
of
a
business
tycoon
part
of
my
job
he
continues
is
to
be
familiar
with
the
rules
of
guilds
and
unions
and
i
have
to
know
about
the
treaties
between
countries
that
affect
the
payment
of
taxes
smiling
benevolently
his
hands
folded
in

of
him
the
gentlemanly
lawyer
quickly
proves
himself
a
gifted
storyteller
in
his
boston
accent
acquired
during
seven
years
at
harvard
he
delights
in
telling
anecdotes
about
his
favorite
performers
not
shy
about
dropping
names
weissberger
drops
only
the
biggest
such
as
sir
laurence
olivier
a
client
who
had
invited
him
to
lunch
the
previous
day
and
martha
graham
his
work
is
so
crowded
that
whenever
he
has
to
read
anything
that
is
longer
than
three
pages
he
puts
it
in
his
weekend
bag
yet
weissberger
devotes
an
hour
or
two
every
day
to
one
of
several
philanthropic
organizations
at
the
top
of
his
list
is
the
martha
graham
center
of
contemporary
dance
of
which
he
is
i
consider
her
one
of
the
three
great
seminal
figures
in
the
arts
in
the
century
and
i
prize
her
friendship
enormously
the
other
two
outstanding
artistic
figures
of
the
century
he
says
are
stravinsky
who
it
was
also
my
privilege
to
represent
and
picasso
who
i
did
not
represent
he
serves
as
chairman
of
the
new
dramatists
a
group
that
nurtures
young
playwrights
he
is
a
board
member
of
fountain
house
a
halfway
house
for

and

through

weissberger
lives
in
a
luxurious
eastside
apartment
that
he
shares
with
his
longtime
friend
theatrical
agent
milton
goldman
each
friday
after
work
weissberger
departs
for
seacliff
long
island
where
he
owns
a
house
overlooking
the
ocean
goldman
and
weissberger
whose
careers
have
run
a
parallel
course
during
the
years
of
their
acquaintance
travel
widely
each
summer
generally
spending
a
month
in
london
where
both
have
many
clients
our
interests
are
very
similar
except
that
i
am
an
opera
buff
and
milton
is
not
he
a
realist
i
started
going
to
opera
when
i
was
years
old
so
i
do
mind
if
a
soprano
dies
of
consumption
in
as
long
as
she
sings
beautifully
an
avid
art
collector
weissberger
buys
only
what
he
has
room
to
display
on
the
walls
of
his
home
and
office
for
the
past
years
his
chief
hobby
has
been
photography
he
has
published
two
volumes
of
his
work
and
although
he
has
never
taken
a
photography
course
and
never
uses
flash
he
captures
the
essence
of
his
subjects
through
his
rapport
with
them
i
have
discussed
the
possibility
of
doing
a
photo
book
of
children
i
taken
around
the
world
he
notes
and
now
of
course
i
have
enough
photos
for
a
second
volume
of
famous
faces
his
vigorous
appearance
to
the
contrary
weissberger
claims
to
get
little
exercise
i
have
one
of
those
stationary
bicycles
at
home
but
i
never
gotten
round
to
using
it
and
i
got
to
do
so
before
i
next
see
my
doctor
or
i
wo
be
able
to
face
him
it
interesting
how
doctorial
advice
changes
i
remember
several
years
ago
it
was
not
considered
a
good
idea
for
people
who
were
no
longer
young
to
climb
stairs
and
now
my
doctor
says
that
climbing
stairs
is
the
best
thing
i
can
do
for
my
constitution
so
closely
connected
are
the
various
aspects
of
his
life
that
weissberger
is
able
to
say
there
no
demarcation
between
my
workday
and
my
play
day
people
ask
me
when
i
going
to
retire
and
i
say
there
no
need
for
me
to
retire
because
i
enjoy
my
work
so
much
i
become
part
of
people
lives
i
become
privy
to
their
problems
it
is
in
many
ways
an
extension
an
enhancement
of
my
own
life
to
be
able
to
participate
in
the
lives
of
my
clients
i
remember
a
few
months
ago
when
lilli
palmer
was
sitting
right
there
and
i
said
what
a
lucky
person
i
am
i
having
to
do
a
tax
return
and
i
doing
it
for
lilli
palmer
because
there
sat
this
beautiful
charming
intelligent
lovely
lady
and
i
was
representing
her
professionally
for
me
i
ca
think
of
any
profession
that
could
possibly
be
more
rewarding
eastsider
tom
wicker
author
and
columnist
for
the
york
something
unusual
was
happening
up
ahead
that
much
he
was
sure
of
although
no
sound
of
gunshots
reached
tom
wicker
ears
as
he
rode
in
a
press
bus
in
the
presidential
motorcade
through
the
streets
of
dallas
on
november
gazing
out
the
window
he
observed
crowds
of
people
running
about
in
confusion
shortly
afterward
outside
parkland
hospital
the
full
extent
of
the
tragedy
was
announced
to
the
world
and
tom
wicker
the
only
reporter
from
the
york
who
was
present
that
day
rushed
off
to
write
the
biggest
story
of
his
career
working
feverishly
through
the
afternoon
he
came
up
with
a
paragraph
account
of
the
day
events
that
dominated
the
front
page
the
following
morning
in
decades
to
come
students
and
historians
will
turn
to
wicker
story
on
microfilm
with
perhaps
a
sense
of
wonder
that
it
omits
no
facts
of
major
importance
and
contains
virtually
no
errors
tom
wicker
was
writing
for
history
that
day
and
largely
as
a
result
of
his
masterful
performance
he
was
elevated
the
following
year
to
the
position
of
the
bureau
chief
in
washington
in
he
was
appointed
associate
editor
of
the
newspaper
and
in
he
returned
to
new
york
in
order
to
concentrate
on
his
column
in
the
nation
for
the
past
years
the
column
has
appeared
three
times
weekly
in
the
page
of
the
a
tall
southerner
of
with
a
manner
and
a
carolina
accent
as
thick
as
molasses
wicker
has
managed
to
combine
his
lifelong
career
in
journalism
with
an
independent
career
as
a
book
author
the
most
successful
of
his
seven
novels
the
was
on
the
york
list
for
weeks
in
while
his
most
recent
nonfiction
work
press
a
top
reporter
life
in
and
reflections
on
american
was
published
last
year
by
viking
and
will
soon
be
released
as
a
paperback
by
berkley
in
an
interview
at
his
office
in
the
building
the
affable
articulate
wicker
responds
to
an
opening
question
about
whether
journalists
are
less
accurate
today
than
in
the
past
by
saying
no
i
do
think
they
ever
were
very
accurate
it
hard
to
get
pinpoint
accuracy
under
pressure
i
think
that
an
inherent
weakness
of
daily
journalism
but
you
have
to
consider
that
there
are
something
like
eight
million
words
a
day
coming
in
here
it
very
tough
to
all
of
that
by
deadline
i
think
of
journalism
as
being
kind
of
like
an
early
alert
system
in
his
column
wicker
has
never
been
told
what
to
write
never
had
an
article
killed
or
edited
and
never
been
urged
to
conform
to
the
editorial
policy
some
of
his
pieces
look
best
in
retrospect
for
example
the
three
columns
he
wrote
in
september
and
october
about
the
dangers
of
storing
nuclear
waste
the
sympathy
with
which
he
treated
the
prison
death
of
convict
george
jackson
in
a
column
caught
the
attention
of
inmates
everywhere
and
during
the
uprising
at
new
york
attica
prison
later
that
year
he
was
called
in
as
a
mediator
and
official
observer
his
book
about
the
uprising
time
to
won
him
two
major
literary
awards
and
was
made
a
book
of
the
month
club
selection
an
engaging
public
speaker
who
travels
widely
he
spent
two
months
in
africa
last
year
at
present
he
is
preparing
a
long
article
on
richard
nixon
that
will
appear
in
the
magazine
this
august
to
coincide
with
the
fifth
anniversary
of
the
resignation
asked
for
his
opinion
on
the
seeming
resurgence
of
nixon
as
a
public
figure
wicker
smiles
and
says
i
sure
al
capone
could
have
drawn
a
crowd
the
day
he
got
out
of
prison
i
do
think
nixon
has
been
revived
he
never
was
dead
in
that
sense
he
left
the
white
house
under
a
cloud
yet
he
retained
i
am
sure
millions
of
people
who
supported
him
i
myself
have
always
discounted
these
reports
that
some
future
republican
president
might
appoint
him
a
sort
of
roving
ambassador
as
far
as
his
giving
speeches
at
big
colleges
is
concerned
i
think
that
all
right
he
may
have
made
mistakes
but
i
myself
would
find
it
very
interesting
to
read
an
article
by
richard
nixon
about
foreign
affairs
i
think
he
a
man
of
intelligence
and
knowledge
in
this
area
for
the
past
five
years
wicker
has
been
married
to
pamela
hill
vice
president
of
abc
news
and
executive
producer
of
the
documentary
productions
they
live
in
a
brownstone
on
the
upper
east
side
though
both
enjoy
cooking
their
busy
schedules
call
for
many
visits
to
local
restaurants
wicker
next
book
is
a
historical
novel
about
the
american
civil
war
that
he
has
been
researching
for
several
years
it
probably
wo
be
completed
until
he
says
but
i
expect
it
to
be
the
best
book
i
have
ever
done
it
certainly
the
one
i
putting
the
most
effort
into
at
the
same
time
the
column
is
my
first
priority
that
the
clock
i
punch
my
experience
is
the
more
you
write
the
better
you
get
at
it
it
a
business
in
which
you
keep
sharpening
your
tools
all
the
time
eastsider
tom

during

newspaper
strike
of
a
reporter
named
tom
wolfe
visited
california
in
order
to
write
an
article
for
magazine
about
the
customized
cars
and
the
crowd
they
attracted
when
deadline
arrived
wolfe
was
unable
to
pull
the
article
together
so
he
typed
out
his
largely
impressionistic
notes
and
sent
them
to
the
editor
who
decided
to
run
the
streamline
baby
exactly
as
written
thus
was
tom
wolfe
established
as
one
of
the
most
important
new
talents
in
american
journalism
today
he
is
generally
recognized
as
the
foremost
proponent
of
what
might
be
called
the
nonfiction
short
story
the
majority
of
his
eight
books
are
collections
of
factual
articles
written
in
the
style
of
fiction
his
latest
effort
right
farrar
straus
and
giroux
is
about
the
seven
mercury
astronauts
and
the
world
of
military
flying
over
cocktails
at
the
isle
of
capri
a
restaurant
not
far
from
his
eastside
apartment
the
slender
gentlemanly
and
slightly
bashful
author
spoke
at
length
about
his
new
book
and
a
dozen
other
subjects
dressed
in
a
swallowtail
yellow
pinstriped
suit
it
kind
of
an
early
duke
of
windsor
he
poured
forth
his
colorful
phrases
in
a
rich
soothing
mildly
southern
accent
that
rang
with
sincerity
i
began
this
book
in
when
asked
me
to
go
down
to
the
cape
and
cover
apollo
somewhat
to
my
surprise
i
became
quite
interested
in
the
whole
business
of
what
the
makeup
of
someone
who
willing
to
sit
on
top
of
a
rocket
and
let
you
light
the
candle
and
i
ended
up
writing
four
stories
for
in
about
a
month
and
i
thought
if
i
spent
a
couple
of
months
in
expanding
them
i
have
a
book
well
it
now
and
here
we
are
he
laughed
heartily
it
was
so
difficult
that
i
put
it
aside
every
opportunity
i
had
i
wrote
three
other
books
in
the
meantime
to
avoid
working
on
it
i
ended
up
being
more
interested
in
the
fraternity
of
flying
than
in
space
exploration
i
found
the
reactions
of
people
and
flying
conditions
much
more
fascinating
so
the
book
is
really
about
the
right
stuff
the
code
of
bravery
that
the
pilots
live
by
and
the
mystical
belief
about
what
it
takes
to
be
a
hot
fighter
jock
flying
has
a
competitive
structure
that
as
hotly
contested
as
the
world
of
show
business
and
the
egos
are
just
as
big
in
fact
in
a
way
bigger
it
hard
to
top
surgeons
for
sheer
ego
i
think
surgeons
are
the
most
egotistical
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
but
pilots
usually
make
the
playoffs
they
in
there
an
excellent
caricaturist
who
has
published
hundreds
of
drawings
and
mounted
several
major
exhibitions
he
confessed
to
being
vain
about
his
artwork
because
i
do
feel
as
sure
of
myself
as
i
do
in
writing
a
book
of
his
drawings
will
come
out
in
he
also
has
a
captioned
drawing
each
month
in
the
magazine
where
his
wife
sheila
works
as
art
director
tom
was
a
lifelong
bachelor
until
they
were
married
last
year
he
arrived
in
new
york
in
armed
with
a
from
yale
and
three
years
experience
on
the
i
really
love
it
in
new
york
it
reminds
me
of
the
state
fair
in
virginia
where
i
grew
up
the
picture
of
the
east
side
really
is
of
the
man
living
in
the
leaving
the
building
at
night
with
his
wife
both
clothed
in
turtleneck
sweaters
with
pieces
of
barbed
wire
and
jeans
going
past
a
doorman
who
is
dressed
like
an
austrian
army
colonel
from
no
relation
to
the
novelist
thomas
wolfe
tom
wolfe
has
written
only
one
short
piece
of
fiction
in
his
life
he
is
now
thinking
about
writing
a
type
of
novel
about
new
york
as
his
next
major
undertaking
in
the
meantime
he
is
working
on
a
sequel
to
painted
his
essay
abut
modern
art
that
appeared
in
another
thing
i
like
to
try
is
a
movie
script
he
added
i
done
one
a
series
of
vignettes
about
life
in
los
angeles
but
many
talented
writers
just
go
bananas
in
trying
to
write
for
the
movies
because
not
in
charge
of
what
they
doing
all
that
a
good
director
can
do
is
keep
from
ruining
the
script
he
can
not
turn
a
bad
script
into
a
good
movie
he
can
turn
a
good
script
into
a
bad
movie
and
often
i
think
it
happens
because
the
director
is
given
a
power
that
he
simply
should
not
have
another
possible
project
said
wolfe

and
let
you
light
the
candle
and
i
ended
up
writing
four
stories
for
in
about
a
month
and
i
thought
if
i
spent
a
couple
of
months
in
expanding
them
i
have
a
book
well
it
now
and
here
we
are
he
laughs
it
was
so
difficult
that
i
put
it
aside
every
opportunity
i
had
i
wrote
three
other
books
in
the
meantime
to
avoid
working
on
it
i
ended
up
being
more
interested
in
the
fraternity
of
flying
than
in
space
exploration
i
found
the
reactions
of
people
and
flying
conditions
much
more
fascinating
so
the
book
is
really
about
the
right
stuff
the
code
of
bravery
that
the
pilots
live
by
and
the
mystical
belief
about
what
it
takes
to
be
a
hot
fighter
jock
as
the
expression
goes
i
became
interested
in
people
like
chuck
yeager
who
broke
the
sound
barrier
back
in
when
the
seven
mercury
astronauts
were
chosen
they
were
not
the
seven
hottest
test
pilots
in
america
although
they
were
presented
as
such
at
the
time
the
arrival
of
the
astronauts
as
a
type
completely
upset
the
competitive
hierarchy
of
flying
flying
has
a
competitive
structure
that
as
hotly
contested
as
the
world
of
show
business
and
the
egos
are
just
as
big
in
fact
in
a
way
it
hard
to
top
surgeons
for
sheer
ego
i
think
surgeons
are
the
most
egotistical
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
but
pilots
usually
make
the
playoffs
they
in
there
q
speaking
of
your
other
books
how
do
you
manage
to
know
all
the
hip
phrases
of
the
day
do
you
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
teenagers
a
at
one
time
people
thought
i
was
some
sort
of
medium
who
hung
around
with
children
to
pick
up
what
young
people
were
thinking
and
doing
well
that
interested
me
very
much
in
the
when
suddenly
young
people
were
doing
extraordinary
things
things
they
had
never
done
which
really
boiled
down
to
living
lives
that
they
controlled
sometimes
in
a
communal
way
going
with
their
own
styles
rather
than
imitating
that
of
their
elders
so
it
was
fascinating
i
made
a
point
of
learning
about
it
sometimes
now
i
turn
on
the
radio
and
i
do
recognize
a
single
song
on
the
charts
right
now
i
have
no
idea
what
any
of
the
top
singles
are
and
i
have
the
feeling
that
it
probably
not
worth
finding
out
because
we
now
in
a
phase
where
we
just
filling
in
the
spaces
of
what
was
introduced
by
rock
and
the
beatles
and
the
grateful
dead
and
so
on
there
nothing
very
new
i
do
think
maybe
i
wrong
q
how
do
you
choose
your
clothes
a
right
now
i
in
the
phase
of
pretentiousness
during
the
late
i
had
a
lot
of
fun
by
making
mild
departures
in
style
wearing
white
suits
instead
of
blue
suits
things
like
that
that
was
very
shocking
and
unusual
in
suddenly
things
reached
a
point
beyond
which
it
really
was
worth
going
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
when
jerry
rubin
and
abbie
hoffman
appeared
on
the
cavett
in
body
paint
there
one
direction
in
which
clothes
can
go
that
still
annoys
the
hell
out
of
people
and
that
pretentiousness
if
you
wear
waistcoats
which
i
rather
like
that
annoys
people
spats
more
than
annoy
people
they
infuriate
people
try
it
sometime
if
you
do
believe
me
they
think
that
this
is
an
affront
it
stirs
up
all
sorts
of
resentment
in
a
period
now
in
which
the
picture
of
the
east
side
really
is
of
the
man
living
in
the
leaving
the
building
at
night
both
clothed
in
turtleneck
sweaters
with
pieces
of
barbed
wire
and
jeans
going
past
a
doorman
who
is
dressed
like
an
austrian
army
colonel
from
q
do
you
do
a
lot
of
drawing
a
i
have
a
regular
feature
in
i
do
one
large
drawing
each
month
with
a
caption
q
what
your
artistic
background
a
i
never
was
trained
in
art
i
worked
for
a
commercial
artist
a
number
of
summers
when
i
was
in
high
school
and
i
learned
anatomy
from
drawing
boxers
in
magazine
it
was
the
only
way
i
could
think
of
to
learn
anatomy
i
had
two
gallery
shows
of
drawings
and
i
have
a
book
of
drawings
coming
out
next
year
i
find
myself
very
vain
about
my
drawing
i
guess
i
do
feel
as
sure
of
myself
as
i
do
in
writing
therefore
i
always
straining
to
get
people
reactions
to
what
drawn
what
i
do
mostly
is
caricature
i
try
not
to
make
them
too
cartoony
this
is
a
period
that
absolutely
cries
out
for
good
caricature
part
of
it
is
that
the
great
caricaturists
used
to
be
people
who
were
determined
to
be
fine
artists
every
artist
whether
he
was
good
or
bad
learned
anatomy
very
thoroughly
he
learned
how
to
render
landscapes
buildings
and
learned
something
about
costume
so
the
ones
who
did
make
it
as
easel
painters
might
turn
to
doing
caricature
and
some
of
them
were
spectacular
we
all
grow
up
thinking
we
in
an
era
of
progress
because
we
have
had
so
much
technological
progress
but
it
simply
does
work
that
way
in
art
and
literature
we
living
in
an
era
to
use
mencken
phrase
of
the
sahara
of
the
beaux
arts
i
wrote
about
that
in
painted
in
fact
i
doing
a
sequel
to
that
now
it
will
be
an
article
for
magazine
i
moving
into
the
areas
of
architecture
and
serious
music
and
dance
it
very
enjoyable
to
work
on
a
subject
like
that
after
a
long
haul
of
writing
about
astronauts
essentially
because
it
easier
q
what
do
you
like
to
watch
on
tv
a
to
be
honest
my
two
favorite
shows
are
which
alas
is
no
longer
except
in
reruns
and
the
carson
i
just
think
he
terrific
it
was
such
a
common
currency
among
those
in
the
general
category
of
intellectuals
to
like
the
cavett
and
not
the
carson
and
that
is
so
much
the
party
line
that
it
takes
awhile
to
dawn
on
you
that
carson
is
really
extremely
funny
dick
cavett
he
has
a
lot
of
talent
but
when
it
comes
to
wit
and
even
in
handling
the
language
he
simply
not
in
carson
league
there
are
a
whole
bunch
of
shows
i
must
say
in
which
i
simply
know
who
these
people
are
a
lot
of
magazines
today
are
really
television
magazines
magazine
is
a
television
magazine
look
at
these
people
who
are
they
who
are
mindy
and
mork
i
mean
i
never
seen
the
show
and
yet
they
obviously
extremely
these
magazines
now
in
an
era
in
which
general
circulation
magazines
are
in
trouble
have
hit
upon
this
idea
all
these
people
that
are
watching
television
will
have
the
thrill
of
recognition
if
we
write
about
the
people
they
seen
on
television
so
will
tend
to
give
you
a
kind
of
a
rehash
of
the
game
of
the
week
or
the
fight
that
everyone
saw
on
television
it
kind
of
funny
at
first
television
was
always
cannibalizing
the
printed
word
for
material
and
now
it
suddenly
turning
around
q
do
you
have
any
other
major
projects
coming
up
a
for
years
i
been
telling
myself
that
i
was
going
to
try
a
type
of
novel
about
new
york
and
i
think
i
should
probably
try
to
make
myself
tackle
that
next
i
debated
whether
to
make
it
fiction
or
nonfiction
my
fiction
writing
has
been
confined
to
one
short
story
that
i
did
for
and
i
was
surprised
that
it
was
harder
than
i
thought
to
write
fiction
i
thought
that
i
could
sit
down
on
a
sunday
afternoon
and
knock
out
a
short
story
because
you
could
make
things
up
another
thing
i
like
to
try
is
a
movie
script
i
done
one
a
series
of
vignettes
about
life
in
los
angeles
but
many
talented
writers
just
go
bananas
in
trying
to
write
for
the
movies
because
they
not
in
charge
of
what
they
doing
all
that
a
good
director
can
do
is
keep
from
ruining
the
script
he
can
not
turn
a
bad
script
into
a
good
movie
he
can
turn
a
good
script
into
a
bad
movie
and
often
i
think
it
happens
because
the
director
is
given
a
power
that
he
simply
should
not
have
q
do
you
feel
a
lot
of
pressure
on
yourself
when
you
sit
down
at
the
typewriter
as
being
one
of
the
in
american
writing
today
a
it
was
terrible
after
my
first
book
came
out
and
i
suddenly
got
a
lot
of
publicity
i
never
dreamed
i
get
i
was
still
working
with
the
as
a
general
assignment
reporter
at
the
city
desk
and
i
suddenly
was
made
aware
by
publicity
that
there
was
something
called
the
tom
wolfe
style
and
this
can
really
do
terrible
things
to
you
i
wrote
a
whole
series
of
just
dreadful
article
because
the
first
phase
i
went
through
was
well
i
be
damned
i
have
the
tom
wolfe
style
i
guess
i
better
use
it
and
so
i
started
writing
these
the
second
phase
was
i
got
to
stop
this
it
and
i
would
write
something
and
a
bell
would
go
off
and
i
say
that
tom
wolfe
style
now
is
that
good
the
way
i
used
it
there
or
it
is
bad
the
way
i
used
it
and
this
became
very
troublesome
when
i
did
this
book
right
i
decided
i
really
was
going
to
try
to
tailor
my
language
to
the
mental
atmosphere
of
pilots
and
somehow
make
my
tone
what
i
have
elsewhere
called
the
downstage
voice
writing
in
the
third
person
about
other
people
but
your
own
writing
style
takes
on
their
tone
so
i
think
the
result
is
a
book
that
seems
different
in
style
and
is
sort
of
an
experiment
for
me
westsider

is
not
fun
anymore
sighs
violinist
violist
and
conductor
pinchas
zukerman
it
used
to
be
now
there
are
all
the
checks
and
securities
at
airports
and
the
hotel
standards
have
gone
down
the
luxury
hotel
is
gone
now
it
a
businessman
ramada
inn
kind
of
hotel
but
you
learn
to
live
with
it
since
making
his
american
debut
with
the
new
york
philharmonic
under
leonard
bernstein
years
ago
he
has
been
a
soloist
with
every
major
orchestra
in
europe
and
acted
as
both
conductor
and
soloist
for
most
of
the
leading
orchestras
in
america
his
schedule
of
concerts
a
year
is
solidly
booked
until
and
he
has
a
discography
of
several
dozen
recordings
on
four
labels
for
personal
credits
pinchas
or
pinky
as
he
prefers
to
be
called
has
lived
on
the
west
side
for
years
been
married
to
eugenia
zukerman
for
of
those
years
they
have
two
daughters
one
of
whom
is
a
skilled
pianist
the
york
has
called
him
one
of
the
world
leading
violinists
the
has
said
he
is
absolutely
without
peer
and
the
has
labeled
him
the
most
versatile
of
all
major
musicians
born
in
israel
the
son
of
polish
survivors
of
auschwitz
he
was
invited
to
perform
at
the
white
house
last
year
for
egyptian
president
anwar
sadat
and
israeli
prime
minister
menachem
begin
i
want
to
tell
sadat
he
should
set
up
a
recording
studio
inside
the
pyramids
he
joked
before
the
event
this
year
pinky
greatest
honor
was
his
appointment
as
music
director
of
the
paul
chamber
orchestra
the
only
chamber
orchestra
in
america
but
the
most
astonishing
thing
about
this
burly
muscular
man
who
speaks
nostalgically
of
the
old
days
may
be
his
age
he
i
think
i
had
as
normal
a
childhood
as
one
could
expect
from
a
talented
boy
that
had
to
work
he
muses
in
his
living
room
overlooking
the
hudson
river
serious
one
moment
clownish
the
next
he
frequently
punctuates
his
remarks
with
loud
belly
laughter
pinky
sense
of
humor
is
one
of
the
things
that
endears
him
to
his
close
friend
violinist
itzhak
perlman
who
lives
six
floors
above
they
were
born
three
years
apart
grew
up
a
few
miles
from
each
other
and
both
came
to
new
york
with
the
help
of
violinist
isaac
stern
to
study
at
juilliard
the
pair
sometimes
travel
together
for
concerts
and
according
to
eugenia
zukerman
they
do
things
like
imitate
apes
at
airports
eugenia
herself
is
an
extraordinary
woman
besides
being
a
wife
and
mother
she
is
a
flutist
with
an
international
music
career
of
her
own
frequently
appearing
in
recitals
with
her
husband
in
addition
she
is
a
highly
talented
writer
who
has
written
articles
for
many
leading
publications
and
now
devotes
three
or
four
hours
a
day
to
her
first
novel
on
october
at
and
for
the
next
three
friday
evenings
channel
will
present
a
series
called
to
make
which
documents
pinchas
zukerman
musical
collaborations
with
perlman
stern
and
others
zukerman
life
story
is
told
through
the
use
of
recordings
he
made
before
the
age
of
old
photographs
and
candid
interviews
producing
a
portrait
that
is
often
fascinating
i
think
music
on
tv
is
getting
definitely
better
in
america
ahead
of
the
game
at
the
bbc
and
in
europe
but
they
quickly
catching
up
here
he
notes
sometimes
they
overcompensate
with
pictures
for
the
sake
of
making
a
show
for
the
guy
sitting
with
his
slippers
in
the
living
room
drinking
a
glass
of
beer
they
afraid
to
leave
the
camera
on
the
same
musician
for
three
minutes
that
why
you
got
this
flute
playing
and
you
see
this
horn
player
picking
his
nose
when
i
ask
pinky
about
critics
the
color
rises
in
his
cheeks
do
get
me
on
critics
he
warns
before
launching
into
an
unrestrained
diatribe
first
of
all
they
not
critics
as
far
as
i
concerned
they
should
be
reporters
but
they
never
report
what
goes
on
in
the
concert
hall
the
public
stood
up
and
clapped
for
minutes
say
it
damn
it
do
say
that
bar
was
not
right
in
the
beethoven
g
major
sonata
who
cares
it
so
stupid
i
a
great
fiddle
player
they
all
say
that
fine
it
understood
granted
it
there
okay
so
instead
of
criticizing
my
fiddle
playing
they
say
i
becoming
aloof
and
this
and
that
one
week
they
tear
me
to
shreds
for
my
conducting
the
next
week
i
get
these
rave
reviews
now
how
can
one
person
be
that
different
in
one
week
what
do
they
think
that
i
a
duet
asked
how
much
time
he
spends
practicing
pinky
replies
as
much
as
i
need
to
i
do
think
about
time
you
either
live
music
or
you
do
music
is
an
unending
art
form
which
demands
your
complete
attention
and
perfection
at
all
times
what
a
wonderful
thing
to
be
able
to
say
i
be
able
to
say
it
in
maybe
or
years
that
i
have
gone
through
all
of
schubert
works
what
an
incredible
achievement
that
is
i
can
tell
you
it
a
lot
more
satisfying
than
flying
an
airplane

end
