the
science
of
health
whether
the
british
race
is
improving
or
degenerating
what
if
it
seem
probably
degenerating
are
the
causes
of
so
great
an
evil
how
they
can
be
if
not
destroyed
at
least
arrested
these
are
questions
worthy
the
attention
not
of
statesmen
only
and
medical
men
but
of
every
father
and
mother
in
these
isles
i
shall
say
somewhat
about
them
in
this
essay
and
say
it
in
a
form
which
ought
to
be
intelligible
to
fathers
and
mothers
of
every
class
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
in
hopes
of
convincing
some
of
them
at
least
that
the
science
of
health
now
so
utterly
neglected
in
our
curriculum
of
education
ought
to
be
taught
the
rudiments
of
it
at
least
in
every
school
college
and
university
we
talk
of
our
hardy
forefathers
and
rightly
but
they
were
hardy
just
as
the
savage
is
usually
hardy
because
none
but
the
hardy
lived
they
may
have
been
able
to
say
of
themselves
as
they
do
in
a
state
paper
of
now
well
known
through
the
pages
of
froude
what
comyn
folk
of
all
the
world
may
compare
with
the
comyns
of
england
in
riches
freedom
liberty
welfare
and
all
prosperity
what
comyn
folk
is
so
mighty
and
so
strong
in
the
felde
as
the
comyns
of
england
they
may
have
been
fed
on
great
shins
of
beef
till
they
became
as
benvenuto
cellini
calls
them
the
english
wild
beasts
but
they
increased
in
numbers
slowly
if
at
all
for
centuries
those
terrible
laws
of
natural
selection
which
issue
in
the
survival
of
the
fittest
cleared
off
the
less
fit
in
every
generation
principally
by
infantile
disease
often
by
wholesale
famine
and
pestilence
and
left
on
the
whole
only
those
of
the
strongest
constitutions
to
perpetuate
a
hardy
valiant
and
enterprising
race
at
last
came
a
sudden
and
unprecedented
change
in
the
first
years
of
the
century
steam
and
commerce
produced
an
enormous
increase
in
the
population
millions
of
fresh
human
beings
found
employment
married
brought
up
children
who
found
employment
in
their
turn
and
learnt
to
live
more
or
less
civilised
lives
an
event
doubtless
for
which
god
is
to
be
thanked
a
quite
new
phase
of
humanity
bringing
with
it
new
vices
and
new
dangers
but
bringing
also
not
merely
new
comforts
but
new
noblenesses
new
generosities
new
conceptions
of
duty
and
of
how
that
duty
should
be
done
it
is
childish
to
regret
the
old
times
when
our
manufacturing
districts
were
green
with
lonely
farms
to
murmur
at
the
transformation
would
be
i
believe
to
murmur
at
the
will
of
him
without
whom
not
a
sparrow
falls
to
the
ground
the
old
order
changeth
yielding
place
to
the
new
and
god
fulfils
himself
in
many
ways
lest
one
good
custom
should
corrupt
the
world
our
duty
is
instead
of
longing
for
the
good
old
custom
to
take
care
of
the
good
new
custom
lest
it
should
corrupt
the
world
in
like
wise
and
it
may
do
so
thus
the
rapid
increase
of
population
during
the
first
half
of
this
century
began
at
a
moment
when
the
british
stock
was
specially
exhausted
namely
about
the
end
of
the
long
french
war
there
may
have
been
periods
of
exhaustion
at
least
in
england
before
that
there
may
have
been
one
here
as
there
seems
to
have
been
on
the
continent
after
the
crusades
and
another
after
the
wars
of
the
roses
there
was
certainly
a
period
of
severe
exhaustion
at
the
end
of
elizabeth
reign
due
both
to
the
long
spanish
and
irish
wars
and
to
the
terrible
endemics
introduced
from
abroad
an
exhaustion
which
may
have
caused
in
part
the
national
weakness
which
hung
upon
us
during
the
reign
of
the
stuarts
but
after
none
of
these
did
the
survival
of
the
less
fit
suddenly
become
more
easy
or
the
discovery
of
steam
power
and
the
acquisition
of
a
colonial
empire
create
at
once
a
fresh
demand
for
human
beings
and
a
fresh
supply
of
food
for
them
britain
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
in
an
altogether
new
social
situation
at
the
beginning
of
the
great
french
war
and
indeed
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
with
spain
in
often
snubbed
as
the
war
about
jenkins
ear
but
which
was
as
i
hold
one
of
the
most
just
as
it
was
one
of
the
most
popular
of
all
our
wars
after
too
the
once
famous
forty
fine
harvests
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
british
people
from
the
gentleman
who
led
to
the
soldier
or
sailor
who
followed
were
one
of
the
mightiest
and
most
capable
races
which
the
world
has
ever
seen
comparable
best
to
the
old
roman
at
his
mightiest
and
most
capable
period
that
at
least
their
works
testify
they
created
as
far
as
man
can
be
said
to
create
anything
the
british
empire
they
won
for
us
our
colonies
our
commerce
the
mastery
of
the
seas
of
all
the
world
but
at
what
a
cost
their
bones
are
scattered
far
and
wide
by
mount
and
stream
and
sea
year
after
year
till
the
final
triumph
of
waterloo
not
battle
only
but
worse
destroyers
than
shot
and
shell
fatigue
and
disease
had
been
carrying
off
our
stoutest
ablest
healthiest
young
men
each
of
whom
represented
alas
a
maiden
left
unmarried
at
home
or
married
in
default
to
a
less
able
man
the
strongest
went
to
the
war
each
who
fell
left
a
weaklier
man
to
continue
the
race
while
of
those
who
did
not
fall
too
many
returned
with
tainted
and
weakened
constitutions
to
injure
it
may
be
generations
yet
unborn
the
middle
classes
being
mostly
engaged
in
peaceful
pursuits
suffered
less
of
this
decimation
of
their
finest
young
men
and
to
that
fact
i
attribute
much
of
their
increasing
preponderance
social
political
and
intellectual
to
this
very
day
one
can
not
walk
the
streets
of
any
of
our
great
commercial
cities
without
seeing
plenty
of
men
young
and
whose
whole
bearing
and
stature
shows
that
the
manly
vigour
of
our
middle
class
is
anything
but
exhausted
in
liverpool
especially
i
have
been
much
struck
not
only
with
the
vigorous
countenance
but
with
the
bodily
size
of
the
mercantile
men
on
but
it
must
be
remembered
always
first
that
these
men
are
the
very
elite
of
their
class
the
cleverest
men
the
men
capable
of
doing
most
work
and
next
that
they
are
almost
all
of
them
from
the
great
merchant
who
has
his
villa
out
of
town
and
perhaps
his
moor
in
the
highlands
down
to
the
sturdy
young
volunteer
who
serves
in
the
haberdasher
shop
men
and
that
the
question
is
not
what
they
are
like
now
but
what
their
children
and
especially
the
fine
young
volunteer
will
be
like
and
a
very
serious
question
i
hold
that
to
be
and
for
this
reason
war
is
without
doubt
the
most
hideous
physical
curse
which
fallen
man
inflicts
upon
himself
and
for
this
simple
reason
that
it
reverses
the
very
laws
of
nature
and
is
more
cruel
even
than
pestilence
for
instead
of
issuing
in
the
survival
of
the
fittest
it
issues
in
the
survival
of
the
less
fit
and
therefore
if
protracted
must
deteriorate
generations
yet
unborn
and
yet
a
peace
such
as
we
now
enjoy
prosperous
civilised
humane
is
fraught
though
to
a
less
degree
with
the
very
same
ill
effect
in
the
first
place
tens
of
thousands
who
knows
it
not
lead
sedentary
and
unwholesome
lives
stooping
asphyxiated
employing
as
small
a
fraction
of
their
bodies
as
of
their
minds
and
all
this
in
dwellings
workshops
what
not
the
influences
the
very
atmosphere
of
which
tend
not
to
health
but
to
unhealth
and
to
drunkenness
as
a
solace
under
the
feeling
of
unhealth
and
depression
and
that
such
a
life
must
tell
upon
their
offspring
and
if
their
offspring
grow
up
under
similar
circumstances
upon
their
offspring
offspring
till
a
whole
population
may
become
permanently
degraded
who
does
not
know
for
who
that
walks
through
the
of
any
great
city
does
not
see
moreover
and
this
is
one
of
the
most
fearful
problems
with
which
modern
civilisation
has
to
deal
we
interfere
with
natural
selection
by
our
conscientious
care
of
life
as
surely
as
does
war
itself
if
war
kills
the
most
fit
to
live
we
save
alive
those
who
looking
at
them
from
a
merely
physical
point
of
view
are
most
fit
to
die
everything
which
makes
it
more
easy
to
live
every
sanatory
reform
prevention
of
pestilence
medical
discovery
amelioration
of
climate
drainage
of
soil
improvement
in
workhouses
gaols
every
reformatory
school
every
hospital
every
cure
of
drunkenness
every
influence
in
short
which
has
so
i
am
told
increased
the
average
length
of
life
in
these
islands
by
nearly
since
the
first
establishment
of
life
insurances
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
every
influence
of
this
kind
i
say
saves
persons
alive
who
would
otherwise
have
died
and
the
great
majority
of
these
will
be
even
in
surgical
and
zymotic
cases
those
of
least
resisting
power
who
are
thus
preserved
to
produce
in
time
a
still
less
powerful
progeny
do
i
say
that
we
ought
not
to
save
these
people
if
we
can
god
forbid
the
weakly
the
diseased
whether
infant
or
adult
is
here
on
earth
a
british
citizen
no
more
responsible
for
his
own
weakness
than
for
his
own
existence
society
that
is
in
plain
english
we
and
our
ancestors
are
responsible
for
both
and
we
must
fulfil
the
duty
and
keep
him
in
life
and
if
we
can
heal
strengthen
develop
him
to
the
utmost
and
make
the
best
of
that
which
fate
and
our
own
deservings
have
given
us
to
deal
with
i
do
not
speak
of
higher
motives
still
motives
which
to
every
minister
of
religion
must
be
paramount
and
awful
i
speak
merely
of
physical
and
social
motives
such
as
appeal
to
the
conscience
of
every
man
the
instinct
which
bids
every
man
or
woman
to
save
life
alleviate
pain
like
him
who
causes
his
sun
to
shine
on
the
evil
and
on
the
good
and
his
rain
to
fall
on
the
just
and
on
the
unjust
but
it
is
palpable
that
in
so
doing
we
must
year
by
year
preserve
a
large
percentage
of
weakly
persons
who
marrying
freely
in
their
own
class
must
produce
weaklier
children
and
they
weaklier
children
still
must
did
i
say
there
are
those
who
are
of
opinion
and
i
after
watching
and
comparing
the
histories
of
many
families
indeed
of
every
one
with
whom
i
have
come
in
contact
for
now
years
in
town
and
country
can
only
fear
that
their
opinion
is
but
too
well
founded
on
fact
that
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
in
all
classes
whatsoever
the
children
are
not
equal
to
their
parents
nor
they
again
to
their
grandparents
of
the
beginning
of
the
century
and
that
this
degrading
process
goes
on
most
surely
and
most
rapidly
in
our
large
towns
and
in
proportion
to
the
antiquity
of
those
towns
and
therefore
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
generations
during
which
the
degrading
influences
have
been
at
work
this
and
cognate
dangers
have
been
felt
more
and
more
deeply
as
the
years
have
rolled
on
by
students
of
human
society
to
ward
them
off
theory
after
theory
has
been
put
on
paper
especially
in
france
which
deserve
high
praise
for
their
ingenuity
less
for
their
morality
and
i
fear
still
less
for
their
for
the
theorist
in
his
closet
is
certain
to
ignore
as
inconvenient
to
the
construction
of
his
utopia
certain
of
those
broad
facts
of
human
nature
which
every
active
parish
priest
medical
man
or
guardian
has
to
face
every
day
of
his
life
society
and
british
human
nature
are
what
they
have
become
by
the
indirect
influences
of
long
ages
and
we
can
no
more
reconstruct
the
one
than
we
can
change
the
other
we
can
no
more
mend
men
by
theories
than
we
can
by
coercion
to
which
by
the
by
almost
all
these
theorists
look
longingly
as
their
final
hope
and
mainstay
we
must
teach
men
to
mend
their
own
matters
of
their
own
reason
and
their
own
we
must
teach
them
that
they
are
the
arbiters
of
their
own
destinies
and
to
a
fearfully
great
degree
of
their
children
destinies
after
them
we
must
teach
them
not
merely
that
they
ought
to
be
free
but
that
they
are
free
whether
they
know
it
or
not
for
good
and
for
evil
and
we
must
do
that
in
this
case
by
teaching
them
sound
practical
science
the
science
of
physiology
as
applied
to
health
so
and
so
only
can
we
check
i
do
not
say
stop
entirely
though
i
believe
even
that
to
be
ideally
possible
but
at
least
check
the
process
of
degradation
which
i
believe
to
be
surely
going
on
not
merely
in
these
islands
but
in
every
civilised
country
in
the
world
in
proportion
to
its
civilisation
it
is
still
a
question
whether
science
has
fully
discovered
those
laws
of
hereditary
health
the
disregard
of
which
causes
so
many
marriages
disastrous
to
generations
yet
unborn
but
much
valuable
light
has
been
thrown
on
this
most
mysterious
and
most
important
subject
during
the
last
few
years
that
light
and
i
thank
god
for
it
is
widening
and
deepening
rapidly
and
i
doubt
not
that
in
a
generation
or
two
more
enough
will
be
known
to
be
thrown
into
the
shape
of
practical
and
proveable
rules
and
that
if
not
a
public
opinion
yet
at
least
what
is
more
useful
far
a
private
opinion
will
grow
up
especially
among
educated
women
which
will
prevent
many
a
tragedy
and
save
many
a
life
but
as
to
the
laws
of
personal
health
enough
and
more
than
enough
is
known
already
to
be
applied
safely
and
easily
by
any
adults
however
unlearned
to
the
preservation
not
only
of
their
own
health
but
of
that
of
their
children
the
value
of
healthy
habitations
of
personal
cleanliness
of
pure
air
and
pure
water
of
various
kinds
of
food
according
as
each
tends
to
make
bone
fat
or
muscle
provided
only
provided
only
that
the
food
be
unadulterated
the
value
of
various
kinds
of
clothing
and
physical
exercise
of
a
free
and
equal
development
of
the
without
undue
overstrain
in
any
one
direction
in
one
word
the
method
of
producing
as
far
as
possible
the
mentem
sanam
in
corpore
sano
and
the
wonderful
and
blessed
effects
of
such
obedience
to
those
laws
of
nature
which
are
nothing
but
the
good
will
of
god
expressed
in
facts
their
wonderful
and
blessed
tendency
i
say
to
eliminate
the
germs
of
hereditary
disease
and
to
actually
regenerate
the
human
system
all
this
is
known
known
as
fully
and
clearly
as
any
human
knowledge
need
be
known
it
is
written
in
dozens
of
popular
books
and
pamphlets
and
why
should
this
divine
voice
which
cries
to
man
tending
to
sink
into
effeminate
barbarism
through
his
own
hasty
and
partial
civilisation
it
is
not
too
late
for
your
bodies
as
for
your
spirits
there
is
an
upward
as
well
as
a
downward
path
you
or
if
not
you
at
least
the
children
whom
you
have
brought
into
the
world
for
whom
you
toil
for
whom
you
hoard
for
whom
you
pray
for
whom
you
would
give
your
lives
they
still
may
be
healthy
strong
it
may
be
beautiful
and
have
all
the
intellectual
and
social
as
well
as
the
physical
advantages
which
health
strength
and
beauty
give
ah
why
is
this
divine
voice
now
as
of
old
wisdom
crying
in
the
streets
and
no
man
regarding
her
i
appeal
to
women
who
are
initiated
as
we
men
can
never
be
into
the
stern
mysteries
of
pain
and
sorrow
and
they
who
bring
forth
children
weep
over
children
slave
for
children
and
if
they
have
none
of
their
own
then
slave
with
the
holy
instinct
of
the
sexless
bee
for
the
children
of
others
let
them
say
shall
this
thing
be
let
my
readers
pardon
me
if
i
seem
to
write
too
earnestly
that
i
speak
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
truth
every
medical
man
knows
full
well
not
only
as
a
very
humble
student
of
physiology
but
as
a
parish
priest
of
thirty
years
standing
i
have
seen
so
much
unnecessary
misery
and
i
have
in
other
cases
seen
similar
misery
so
simply
avoided
that
the
sense
of
the
vastness
of
the
evil
is
intensified
by
my
sense
of
the
easiness
of
the
cure
why
then
to
come
to
practical
suggestions
should
there
not
be
opened
in
every
great
town
in
these
realms
a
public
school
of
health
it
might
connect
itself
with
i
hold
that
it
should
form
an
integral
part
of
some
existing
educational
institute
but
it
should
at
least
give
practical
lectures
for
fees
small
enough
to
put
them
within
the
reach
of
any
respectable
man
or
woman
however
poor
i
can
not
but
hope
that
such
schools
of
health
if
opened
in
the
great
manufacturing
towns
of
england
and
scotland
and
indeed
in
such
an
irish
town
as
belfast
would
obtain
pupils
in
plenty
and
pupils
who
would
thoroughly
profit
by
what
they
hear
the
people
of
these
towns
are
most
of
them
specially
accustomed
by
their
own
trades
to
the
application
of
scientific
laws
to
them
therefore
the
application
of
any
fresh
physical
laws
to
a
fresh
set
of
facts
would
have
nothing
strange
in
it
they
have
already
something
of
that
inductive
habit
of
mind
which
is
the
groundwork
of
all
rational
understanding
or
action
they
would
not
turn
the
deaf
and
contemptuous
ear
with
which
the
savage
and
the
superstitious
receive
the
revelation
of
nature
mysteries
why
should
not
with
so
hopeful
an
audience
the
experiment
be
tried
far
and
wide
of
giving
lectures
on
health
as
supplementary
to
those
lectures
on
animal
physiology
which
are
i
am
happy
to
say
becoming
more
and
more
common
why
should
not
people
be
taught
they
are
already
being
taught
at
birmingham
something
about
the
tissues
of
the
body
their
structure
and
uses
the
circulation
of
the
blood
respiration
chemical
changes
in
the
air
respired
amount
breathed
digestion
nature
of
food
absorption
secretion
structure
of
the
nervous
system
in
fact
be
taught
something
of
how
their
own
bodies
are
made
and
how
they
work
teaching
of
this
kind
ought
to
and
will
in
some
more
civilised
age
and
country
be
held
a
necessary
element
in
the
of
every
child
just
as
necessary
as
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
for
it
is
after
all
the
most
necessary
branch
of
that
technical
education
of
which
we
hear
so
much
just
now
namely
the
technic
or
art
of
keeping
oneself
alive
and
well
but
we
can
hardly
stop
there
after
we
have
taught
the
condition
of
health
we
must
teach
also
the
condition
of
disease
of
those
diseases
specially
which
tend
to
lessen
wholesale
the
health
of
townsfolk
exposed
to
an
artificial
mode
of
life
surely
young
men
and
women
should
be
taught
something
of
the
causes
of
zymotic
disease
and
of
scrofula
consumption
rickets
dipsomania
cerebral
derangement
and
such
like
they
should
be
shown
the
practical
value
of
pure
air
pure
water
unadulterated
food
sweet
and
dry
dwellings
is
there
one
of
them
man
or
woman
who
would
not
be
the
safer
and
happier
and
the
more
useful
to
his
or
her
neighbours
if
they
had
acquired
some
sound
notions
about
those
questions
of
drainage
on
which
their
own
lives
and
the
lives
of
their
children
may
every
day
depend
i
say
women
as
well
as
men
i
should
have
said
women
rather
than
men
for
it
is
the
women
who
have
the
ordering
of
the
household
the
bringing
up
of
the
children
the
women
who
bide
at
home
while
the
men
are
away
it
may
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
earth
and
if
any
say
as
they
have
a
right
to
say
but
these
are
subjects
which
can
hardly
be
taught
to
young
women
in
public
lectures
i
rejoin
of
course
not
unless
they
are
taught
by
women
by
women
of
course
duly
educated
and
legally
qualified
let
such
teach
to
women
what
every
woman
ought
to
know
and
what
her
parents
will
very
properly
object
to
her
hearing
from
almost
any
man
this
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
i
have
for
twenty
years
past
advocated
the
training
of
women
for
the
medical
profession
and
one
which
countervails
in
my
mind
all
possible
objections
to
such
a
movement
and
now
thank
god
i
am
seeing
the
common
sense
of
great
britain
and
indeed
of
every
civilised
nation
gradually
coming
round
to
that
which
seemed
to
me
when
i
first
conceived
of
it
a
dream
too
chimerical
to
be
cherished
save
in
secret
the
restoring
woman
to
her
natural
share
in
that
sacred
office
of
healer
which
she
held
in
the
middle
ages
and
from
which
she
was
thrust
out
during
the
sixteenth
century
i
am
most
happy
to
see
for
instance
that
the
national
health
society
which
i
earnestly
recommend
to
the
attention
of
my
readers
announces
a
course
of
lectures
for
ladies
on
elementary
physiology
and
hygiene
by
miss
chessar
to
which
i
am
also
most
happy
to
see
governesses
are
admitted
at
alas
how
much
misery
disease
and
even
death
might
have
been
prevented
had
governesses
been
taught
such
matters
thirty
years
ago
i
for
one
know
too
well
may
the
day
soon
come
when
there
will
be
educated
women
enough
to
give
such
lectures
throughout
these
realms
to
rich
as
well
as
poor
for
the
rich
strange
to
say
need
them
often
as
much
as
the
poor
do
and
that
we
may
live
to
see
in
every
great
town
health
classes
for
women
as
well
as
for
men
sending
forth
year
by
year
more
young
women
and
young
men
taught
not
only
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
of
their
families
but
to
exercise
moral
influence
over
their
as
champions
in
the
battle
against
dirt
and
drunkenness
disease
and
death
there
may
be
those
who
would
answer
or
rather
there
would
certainly
have
been
those
who
would
have
so
answered
thirty
years
ago
before
the
materialism
of
advanced
science
had
taught
us
some
practical
wisdom
about
education
and
reminded
people
that
they
have
bodies
as
well
as
minds
and
souls
you
say
we
are
likely
to
grow
weaklier
unhealthier
and
if
it
were
so
what
matter
mind
makes
the
man
not
body
we
do
not
want
our
children
to
be
stupid
giants
and
bravos
but
clever
able
highly
educated
however
weakly
providence
or
the
laws
of
nature
may
have
chosen
to
make
them
let
them
overstrain
their
brains
a
little
let
them
contract
their
chests
and
injure
their
digestion
and
their
eyesight
by
sitting
at
desks
poring
over
books
intellect
is
what
we
want
intellect
makes
money
intellect
makes
the
world
we
would
rather
see
our
son
a
genius
than
an
athlete
well
and
so
would
i
but
what
if
intellect
alone
does
not
even
make
money
save
as
dodson
fogg
sampson
brass
and
montagu
tigg
were
wont
to
make
it
unless
backed
by
an
able
enduring
healthy
physique
such
as
i
have
seen
almost
without
exception
in
those
successful
men
of
business
whom
i
have
had
the
honour
and
the
pleasure
of
knowing
what
if
intellect
or
what
is
now
called
intellect
did
not
make
the
world
or
the
smallest
wheel
or
cog
of
it
what
if
for
want
of
obeying
the
laws
of
nature
parents
bred
up
neither
a
genius
nor
an
athlete
but
only
an
incapable
unhappy
personage
with
a
huge
upright
forehead
like
that
of
a
byzantine
greek
filled
with
some
sort
of
pap
instead
of
brains
and
tempted
alternately
to
fanaticism
and
strong
drink
we
must
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
have
the
corpus
sanem
if
we
want
the
mentem
sanem
and
healthy
bodies
are
the
only
trustworthy
organs
for
healthy
minds
which
is
cause
and
which
is
effect
i
shall
not
stay
to
debate
here
but
wherever
we
find
a
population
generally
weakly
stunted
scrofulous
we
find
in
them
a
corresponding
type
of
brain
which
can
not
be
trusted
to
do
good
work
which
is
capable
more
or
less
of
madness
whether
solitary
or
epidemic
it
may
be
very
active
it
may
be
very
quick
at
catching
at
new
and
grand
ideas
all
the
more
quick
perhaps
on
account
of
its
own
secret
and
but
it
will
be
irritable
spasmodic
hysterical
it
will
be
apt
to
mistake
capacity
of
talk
for
capacity
of
action
excitement
for
earnestness
virulence
for
force
and
too
often
cruelty
for
justice
it
will
lose
manful
independence
individuality
originality
and
when
men
act
they
will
act
from
the
consciousness
of
personal
weakness
like
sheep
rushing
over
a
hedge
leaning
against
each
other
exhorting
each
other
to
be
brave
and
swaying
about
in
mobs
and
masses
these
were
the
intellectual
weaknesses
which
as
i
read
history
followed
on
physical
degradation
in
imperial
rome
in
alexandria
in
byzantium
have
we
not
seen
them
reappear
under
fearful
forms
in
paris
but
the
other
day
i
do
not
blame
i
do
not
judge
my
theory
which
i
hold
and
shall
hold
to
be
fairly
founded
on
a
wide
induction
forbids
me
to
blame
and
to
judge
because
it
tells
me
that
these
defects
are
mainly
physical
that
those
who
exhibit
them
are
mainly
to
be
pitied
as
victims
of
the
sins
or
ignorance
of
their
forefathers
but
it
tells
me
too
that
those
who
professing
to
be
educated
men
and
therefore
bound
to
know
better
treat
these
physical
phenomena
as
spiritual
healthy
and
praiseworthy
who
even
exasperate
them
that
they
may
make
capital
out
of
the
weaknesses
of
fallen
man
are
the
most
contemptible
and
yet
the
most
dangerous
of
public
enemies
let
them
cloak
their
quackery
under
whatsoever
patriotic
or
scientific
or
even
sacred
words
there
are
those
again
honest
kindly
sensible
practical
men
many
of
them
men
whom
i
have
no
wish
to
offend
whom
i
had
rather
ask
to
teach
me
some
of
their
own
experience
and
common
sense
which
has
learned
to
discern
like
good
statesmen
not
only
what
ought
to
be
done
but
what
can
be
done
there
are
those
i
say
who
would
sooner
see
this
whole
question
let
alone
their
feeling
as
far
as
i
can
analyse
it
seems
to
be
that
the
evils
of
which
i
have
been
complaining
are
on
the
whole
inevitable
or
if
not
that
we
can
mend
so
very
little
of
them
that
it
is
wisest
to
leave
them
alone
altogether
lest
like
certain
sewers
the
more
you
stir
them
the
more
they
smell
they
fear
lest
we
should
unsettle
the
minds
of
the
many
for
whom
these
evils
will
never
be
mended
lest
we
make
them
discontented
discontented
with
their
houses
their
occupations
their
food
their
whole
social
arrangements
and
all
in
vain
i
should
answer
in
all
courtesy
and
humility
for
i
sympathise
deeply
with
such
men
and
women
and
respect
them
deeply
likewise
but
are
not
people
discontented
already
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
and
ought
a
man
in
such
a
piecemeal
foolish
greedy
sinful
world
as
this
is
and
always
has
been
to
be
anything
but
discontented
if
he
thinks
that
things
are
going
all
right
must
he
not
have
a
most
beggarly
conception
of
what
going
right
means
and
if
things
are
not
going
right
can
it
be
anything
but
good
for
him
to
see
that
they
are
not
going
right
can
truth
and
fact
harm
any
human
being
i
shall
not
believe
so
as
long
as
i
have
a
bible
wherein
to
believe
for
my
part
i
should
like
to
make
every
man
woman
and
child
whom
i
meet
discontented
with
themselves
even
as
i
am
discontented
with
myself
i
should
like
to
awaken
in
them
about
their
physical
their
intellectual
their
moral
condition
that
divine
discontent
which
is
the
parent
first
of
upward
aspiration
and
then
of
thought
effort
to
fulfil
that
aspiration
even
in
part
for
to
be
discontented
with
the
divine
discontent
and
to
be
ashamed
with
the
noble
shame
is
the
very
germ
and
first
upgrowth
of
all
virtue
men
begin
at
first
as
boys
begin
when
they
grumble
at
their
school
and
their
schoolmasters
to
lay
the
blame
on
others
to
be
discontented
with
their
circumstances
the
things
which
stand
around
them
and
to
cry
oh
that
i
had
this
oh
that
i
had
that
but
that
way
no
deliverance
lies
that
discontent
only
ends
in
revolt
and
rebellion
social
or
political
and
that
again
still
in
the
same
worship
of
circumstances
but
this
time
desperate
which
ends
let
it
disguise
itself
under
what
fine
names
it
will
in
what
the
old
greeks
called
a
tyranny
in
which
as
in
the
spanish
republics
of
america
and
in
france
more
than
once
all
have
become
the
voluntary
slaves
of
one
man
because
each
man
fancies
that
the
one
man
can
improve
his
circumstances
for
him
but
the
wise
man
will
learn
like
epictetus
the
heroic
slave
the
slave
of
epaphroditus
nero
minion
and
in
what
baser
and
uglier
circumstances
could
human
being
find
himself
to
find
out
the
secret
of
being
truly
free
namely
to
be
discontented
with
no
man
and
no
thing
save
himself
to
say
not
oh
that
i
had
this
and
that
but
oh
that
i
were
this
and
that
then
by
god
help
and
that
heroic
slave
heathen
though
he
was
believed
and
trusted
in
god
help
i
will
make
myself
that
which
god
has
shown
me
that
i
ought
to
be
and
can
be
ten
thousand
or
ten
million
as
epictetus
saw
full
well
can
not
mend
that
vulgar
discontent
with
circumstances
which
he
had
felt
and
who
with
more
right
and
conquered
and
despised
for
that
is
the
discontent
of
children
wanting
always
more
holidays
and
more
sweets
but
i
wish
my
readers
to
have
and
to
cherish
the
discontent
of
men
and
women
therefore
i
would
make
men
and
women
discontented
with
the
divine
and
wholesome
discontent
at
their
own
physical
frame
and
at
that
of
their
children
i
would
accustom
their
eyes
to
those
precious
heirlooms
of
the
human
race
the
statues
of
the
old
greeks
to
their
tender
grandeur
their
chaste
healthfulness
their
unconscious
because
perfect
might
and
say
there
these
are
tokens
to
you
and
to
all
generations
yet
unborn
of
what
man
could
be
once
of
what
he
can
be
again
if
he
will
obey
those
laws
of
nature
which
are
the
voice
of
god
i
would
make
them
discontented
with
the
ugliness
and
closeness
of
their
dwellings
i
would
make
the
men
discontented
with
the
fashion
of
their
garments
and
still
more
just
now
the
women
of
all
ranks
with
the
fashion
of
theirs
and
with
everything
around
them
which
they
have
the
power
of
improving
if
it
be
at
all
ungraceful
superfluous
tawdry
ridiculous
unwholesome
i
would
make
them
discontented
with
what
they
call
their
education
and
say
to
them
you
call
the
three
royal
r
education
they
are
not
education
no
more
is
the
knowledge
which
would
enable
you
to
take
the
highest
prizes
given
by
the
society
of
arts
or
any
other
body
they
are
not
education
they
are
only
instruction
a
necessary
groundwork
in
an
age
like
this
for
making
practical
use
of
your
education
but
not
the
education
itself
and
if
they
asked
me
what
then
education
meant
i
should
point
them
first
i
think
to
noble
old
lilly
noble
old
of
three
hundred
years
ago
and
ask
them
to
consider
what
it
says
about
education
and
especially
this
passage
concerning
that
mere
knowledge
which
is
days
strangely
miscalled
education
there
are
two
principal
and
peculiar
gifts
in
the
nature
of
man
knowledge
and
reason
the
one
that
is
reason
commandeth
and
the
other
that
is
knowledge
obeyeth
these
things
neither
the
whirling
wheel
of
fortune
can
change
nor
the
deceitful
cavillings
of
worldlings
separate
neither
sickness
abate
nor
age
abolish
and
next
i
should
point
them
to
those
pages
in
gladstone
mundi
where
he
describes
the
ideal
training
of
a
greek
youth
in
homer
days
and
say
there
that
is
an
education
fit
for
a
really
civilised
man
even
though
he
never
saw
a
book
in
his
life
the
full
proportionate
harmonious
educing
that
is
bringing
out
and
developing
of
all
the
faculties
of
his
body
mind
and
heart
till
he
becomes
at
once
a
reverent
yet
a
a
graceful
and
yet
a
valiant
an
able
and
yet
an
eloquent
personage
and
if
any
should
say
to
me
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
science
homer
greeks
knew
no
science
i
should
rejoin
but
they
had
above
all
ancient
races
which
we
know
the
scientific
instinct
the
teachableness
and
modesty
the
clear
eye
and
quick
ear
the
hearty
reverence
for
fact
and
nature
and
for
the
human
body
and
mind
and
spirit
for
human
nature
in
a
word
in
its
completeness
as
the
highest
fact
upon
this
earth
therefore
they
became
in
after
years
not
only
the
great
colonisers
and
the
great
civilisers
of
the
old
world
the
most
practical
people
i
hold
which
the
world
ever
saw
but
the
parents
of
all
sound
physics
as
well
as
of
all
sound
metaphysics
their
very
religion
in
spite
of
its
imperfections
helped
forward
their
education
not
in
spite
of
but
by
means
of
that
anthropomorphism
which
we
sometimes
too
hastily
decry
as
gladstone
says
in
a
passage
which
i
must
quote
at
length
as
regarded
all
other
functions
of
our
nature
outside
the
domain
of
the
life
to
godward
all
those
functions
which
are
summed
up
in
what
paul
calls
the
flesh
and
the
mind
the
psychic
and
bodily
life
the
tendency
of
the
system
was
to
exalt
the
human
element
by
proposing
a
model
of
beauty
strength
and
wisdom
in
all
their
combinations
so
elevated
that
the
effort
to
attain
them
required
a
continual
upward
strain
it
made
divinity
attainable
and
thus
it
effectually
directed
the
thought
and
aim
of
man
the
line
of
limitless
desires
such
a
scheme
of
religion
though
failing
grossly
in
the
government
of
the
passions
and
in
upholding
the
standard
of
moral
duties
tended
powerfully
to
produce
a
lofty
and
a
large
free
and
varied
conception
of
humanity
it
incorporated
itself
in
schemes
of
notable
discipline
for
mind
and
body
indeed
of
a
lifelong
education
and
these
habits
of
mind
and
action
had
their
marked
results
to
omit
many
other
greatnesses
in
a
philosophy
literature
and
art
which
remain
to
this
day
unrivalled
or
unsurpassed
so
much
those
old
greeks
did
for
their
own
education
without
science
and
without
christianity
we
who
have
both
what
might
we
not
do
if
we
would
be
true
to
our
advantages
and
to
ourselves
the
two
breaths
a
lecture
delivered
at
winchester
may
ladies
i
have
been
honoured
by
a
second
invitation
to
address
you
here
from
the
lady
to
whose
public
spirit
the
establishment
of
these
lectures
is
due
i
dare
not
refuse
it
because
it
gives
me
an
opportunity
of
speaking
on
a
matter
knowledge
and
ignorance
about
which
may
seriously
affect
your
health
and
happiness
and
that
of
the
children
with
whom
you
may
have
to
do
i
must
apologize
if
i
say
many
things
which
are
well
known
to
many
persons
in
this
room
they
ought
to
be
well
known
to
all
and
it
is
generally
best
to
assume
total
ignorance
in
one
hearers
and
to
begin
from
the
beginning
i
shall
try
to
be
as
simple
as
possible
to
trouble
you
as
little
as
possible
with
scientific
terms
to
be
practical
and
at
the
same
time
if
possible
interesting
i
should
wish
to
call
this
lecture
the
two
breaths
not
merely
the
breath
and
for
this
reason
every
time
you
breathe
you
breathe
two
different
breaths
you
take
in
one
you
give
out
another
the
composition
of
those
two
breaths
is
different
their
effects
are
different
the
breath
which
has
been
breathed
out
must
not
be
breathed
in
again
to
tell
you
why
it
must
not
would
lead
me
into
anatomical
details
not
quite
in
place
here
as
yet
though
the
day
will
come
i
trust
when
every
woman
entrusted
with
the
care
of
children
will
be
expected
to
know
something
about
them
but
this
i
may
say
those
who
habitually
take
in
fresh
breath
will
probably
grow
up
large
strong
ruddy
cheerful
active
fit
for
their
work
those
who
habitually
take
in
the
breath
which
has
been
breathed
out
by
themselves
or
any
other
living
creature
will
certainly
grow
up
if
they
grow
up
at
all
small
weak
pale
nervous
depressed
unfit
for
work
and
tempted
continually
to
resort
to
stimulants
and
become
drunkards
if
you
want
to
see
how
different
the
breath
breathed
out
is
from
the
breath
taken
in
you
have
only
to
try
a
somewhat
cruel
experiment
but
one
which
people
too
often
try
upon
themselves
their
children
and
their
if
you
take
any
small
animal
with
lungs
like
your
own
a
mouse
for
instance
and
force
it
to
breathe
no
air
but
what
you
have
breathed
already
if
you
put
it
in
a
close
box
and
while
you
take
in
breath
from
the
outer
air
send
out
your
breath
through
a
tube
into
that
box
the
animal
will
soon
faint
if
you
go
on
long
with
this
process
it
will
die
take
a
second
instance
which
i
beg
to
press
most
seriously
on
the
notice
of
mothers
governesses
and
nurses
if
you
allow
a
child
to
get
into
the
habit
of
sleeping
with
its
head
under
the
and
thereby
breathing
its
own
breath
over
and
over
again
that
child
will
assuredly
grow
pale
weak
and
medical
men
have
cases
on
record
of
scrofula
appearing
in
children
previously
healthy
which
could
only
be
accounted
for
from
this
habit
and
which
ceased
when
the
habit
stopped
let
me
again
entreat
your
attention
to
this
undoubted
fact
take
another
instance
which
is
only
too
common
if
you
are
in
a
crowded
room
with
plenty
of
fire
and
lights
and
company
doors
and
windows
all
shut
tight
how
often
you
feel
faint
so
faint
that
you
may
require
or
some
other
stimulant
the
cause
of
your
faintness
is
just
the
same
as
that
of
the
mouse
fainting
in
the
box
you
and
your
friends
and
as
i
shall
show
you
presently
the
fire
and
the
candles
likewise
having
been
all
breathing
each
other
breaths
over
and
over
again
till
the
air
has
become
unfit
to
support
life
you
are
doing
your
best
to
enact
over
again
the
highland
tragedy
of
which
sir
james
simpson
tells
in
his
lectures
to
the
of
edinburgh
when
at
a
christmas
meeting
persons
danced
all
night
in
a
small
room
with
a
low
ceiling
keeping
the
doors
and
windows
shut
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
was
noxious
beyond
description
and
the
effect
was
that
seven
of
the
party
were
soon
after
seized
with
typhus
fever
of
which
two
died
you
are
inflicting
on
yourselves
the
torments
of
the
poor
dog
who
is
kept
at
the
grotto
del
cane
near
naples
to
be
stupified
for
the
amusement
of
visitors
by
the
carbonic
acid
gas
of
the
grotto
and
brought
to
life
again
by
being
dragged
into
the
fresh
air
nay
you
are
inflicting
upon
yourselves
the
torments
of
the
famous
black
hole
of
calcutta
and
if
there
was
no
chimney
in
the
room
by
which
some
fresh
air
could
enter
the
candles
would
soon
burn
blue
as
they
do
you
know
when
ghosts
appear
your
brains
become
disturbed
and
you
yourselves
run
the
risk
of
becoming
ghosts
and
the
candles
of
actually
going
out
of
this
last
fact
there
is
no
doubt
for
if
instead
of
putting
a
mouse
into
the
box
you
will
put
a
lighted
candle
and
breathe
into
the
tube
as
before
however
gently
you
will
in
a
short
time
put
the
candle
out
now
how
is
this
first
what
is
the
difference
between
the
breath
you
take
in
and
the
breath
you
give
out
and
next
why
has
it
a
similar
effect
on
animal
life
and
a
lighted
candle
the
difference
is
this
the
breath
which
you
take
in
is
or
ought
to
be
pure
air
composed
on
the
whole
of
oxygen
and
nitrogen
with
a
minute
portion
of
carbonic
acid
the
breath
which
you
give
out
is
an
impure
air
to
which
has
been
added
among
other
matters
which
will
not
support
life
an
excess
of
carbonic
acid
that
this
is
the
fact
you
can
prove
for
yourselves
by
a
simple
experiment
get
a
little
lime
water
at
the
chemist
and
breathe
into
it
through
a
glass
tube
your
breath
will
at
once
make
the
milky
the
carbonic
acid
of
your
breath
has
laid
hold
of
the
lime
and
made
it
visible
as
white
carbonate
of
lime
in
plain
english
as
common
chalk
now
i
do
not
wish
as
i
said
to
load
your
memories
with
scientific
terms
but
i
beseech
you
to
remember
at
least
these
two
oxygen
gas
and
carbonic
acid
gas
and
to
remember
that
as
surely
as
oxygen
feeds
the
fire
of
life
so
surely
does
carbonic
acid
put
it
out
i
say
the
fire
of
life
in
that
expression
lies
the
answer
to
our
second
question
why
does
our
breath
produce
a
similar
effect
upon
the
mouse
and
the
lighted
candle
every
one
of
us
is
as
it
were
a
living
fire
were
we
not
how
could
we
be
always
warmer
than
the
air
outside
us
there
is
a
process
going
on
perpetually
in
each
of
us
similar
to
that
by
which
coals
are
burnt
in
the
fire
oil
in
a
lamp
wax
in
a
candle
and
the
earth
itself
in
a
volcano
to
keep
each
of
those
fires
alight
oxygen
is
needed
and
the
products
of
combustion
as
they
are
called
are
more
or
less
the
same
in
each
case
carbonic
acid
and
steam
these
facts
justify
the
expression
i
just
made
use
of
which
may
have
seemed
to
some
of
you
fantastical
that
the
fire
and
the
candles
in
the
crowded
room
were
breathing
the
same
breath
as
you
were
it
is
but
too
true
an
average
fire
in
the
grate
requires
to
keep
it
burning
as
much
oxygen
as
several
human
beings
do
each
candle
or
lamp
must
have
its
share
of
oxygen
likewise
and
that
a
very
considerable
one
and
an
average
pray
attend
to
this
you
who
live
in
rooms
lighted
with
gas
consumes
as
much
oxygen
as
several
candles
all
alike
are
making
carbonic
acid
the
carbonic
acid
of
the
fire
happily
escapes
up
the
chimney
in
the
smoke
but
the
carbonic
acid
from
the
human
beings
and
the
candles
remains
to
poison
the
room
unless
it
be
ventilated
now
i
think
you
may
understand
one
of
the
simplest
and
yet
most
terrible
cases
of
want
of
ventilation
death
by
the
fumes
of
charcoal
a
human
being
shut
up
in
a
room
of
which
every
crack
is
closed
with
a
pan
of
burning
charcoal
falls
asleep
never
to
wake
again
his
inward
fire
is
competing
with
the
fire
of
the
charcoal
for
the
oxygen
of
the
room
both
are
making
carbonic
acid
out
of
it
but
the
charcoal
being
the
stronger
of
the
two
gets
all
the
oxygen
to
itself
and
leaves
the
human
being
nothing
to
inhale
but
the
carbonic
acid
which
it
has
made
the
human
being
being
the
weaker
dies
first
but
the
charcoal
dies
also
when
it
has
exhausted
all
the
oxygen
of
the
room
it
cools
goes
out
and
is
found
in
the
morning
beside
its
victim
if
you
put
a
giant
or
an
elephant
i
should
conceive
into
that
room
instead
of
a
human
being
the
case
would
be
reversed
for
a
time
the
elephant
would
put
out
the
burning
charcoal
by
the
carbonic
acid
from
his
mighty
lungs
and
then
when
he
had
exhausted
all
the
air
in
the
room
die
likewise
of
his
own
carbonic
acid
now
i
think
we
may
see
what
ventilation
means
and
why
it
is
needed
ventilation
means
simply
letting
out
the
foul
air
and
letting
in
the
fresh
air
letting
out
the
air
which
has
been
breathed
by
men
or
by
candles
and
letting
in
the
air
which
has
not
to
understand
how
to
do
that
we
must
remember
a
most
simple
chemical
law
that
a
gas
as
it
is
warmed
expands
and
therefore
becomes
lighter
as
it
cools
it
contracts
and
becomes
heavier
now
the
carbonic
acid
in
the
breath
which
comes
out
of
our
mouth
is
warm
lighter
than
the
air
and
rises
to
the
ceiling
and
therefore
in
any
unventilated
room
full
of
people
there
is
a
layer
of
foul
air
along
the
ceiling
you
might
soon
test
that
for
yourselves
if
you
could
mount
a
ladder
and
put
your
heads
there
aloft
you
do
test
it
for
yourselves
when
you
sit
in
the
galleries
of
churches
and
theatres
where
the
air
is
palpably
more
foul
and
therefore
more
injurious
than
down
below
where
again
are
employed
in
a
crowded
house
of
many
storeys
the
health
of
those
who
work
on
the
upper
floors
always
suffers
most
in
the
old
of
the
zoological
gardens
when
the
cages
were
on
the
old
plan
tier
upon
tier
the
poor
little
fellows
in
the
uppermost
tier
so
i
have
been
told
always
died
first
of
the
constitutional
complaint
consumption
simply
from
breathing
the
warm
breath
of
their
friends
below
but
since
the
cages
have
been
altered
and
made
to
range
side
by
side
from
top
to
bottom
consumption
i
understand
has
vastly
diminished
among
them
the
first
question
in
ventilation
therefore
is
to
get
this
carbonic
acid
safe
out
of
the
room
while
it
is
warm
and
light
and
close
to
the
ceiling
for
if
you
do
not
this
happens
the
carbonic
acid
gas
cools
and
becomes
heavier
for
carbonic
acid
at
the
same
temperature
as
common
air
is
so
much
heavier
than
common
air
that
you
may
actually
if
you
are
handy
enough
turn
it
from
one
vessel
to
another
and
pour
out
for
your
enemy
a
glass
of
invisible
poison
so
down
to
the
floor
this
heavy
carbonic
acid
comes
and
lies
along
it
just
as
it
lies
often
in
the
bottom
of
old
wells
or
old
brewers
vats
as
a
stratum
of
poison
killing
occasionally
the
men
who
descend
into
it
hence
as
foolish
a
practice
as
i
know
is
that
of
sleeping
on
the
floor
for
towards
the
small
hours
when
the
room
gets
cold
the
sleeper
on
the
floor
is
breathing
carbonic
acid
and
here
one
word
to
those
ladies
who
interest
themselves
with
the
poor
the
poor
are
too
apt
in
times
of
distress
to
pawn
their
bedsteads
and
keep
their
beds
never
if
you
have
influence
let
that
happen
keep
the
bedstead
whatever
else
may
go
to
save
the
sleeper
from
the
carbonic
acid
on
the
floor
how
then
shall
we
get
rid
of
the
foul
air
at
the
top
of
the
room
after
all
that
has
been
written
and
tried
on
ventilation
i
know
no
simpler
method
than
putting
into
the
chimney
one
of
arnott
ventilators
which
may
be
bought
and
fixed
for
a
few
shillings
always
remembering
that
it
must
be
fixed
into
the
chimney
as
near
the
ceiling
as
possible
i
can
speak
of
these
ventilators
from
years
experience
living
in
a
house
with
low
ceilings
liable
to
become
overcharged
with
carbonic
acid
which
produces
sleepiness
in
the
evening
i
have
found
that
these
ventilators
keep
the
air
fresh
and
pure
and
i
consider
the
presence
of
one
of
these
ventilators
in
a
room
more
valuable
than
three
or
four
feet
additional
height
of
ceiling
i
have
found
too
that
their
working
proves
how
necessary
they
are
from
this
simple
fact
you
would
suppose
that
as
the
ventilator
opens
freely
into
the
chimney
the
smoke
would
be
blown
down
through
it
in
high
winds
and
blacken
the
ceiling
but
this
is
just
what
does
not
happen
if
the
ventilator
be
at
all
properly
poised
so
as
to
shut
with
a
violent
gust
of
wind
it
will
at
all
other
moments
keep
itself
permanently
open
proving
thereby
that
there
is
an
of
heated
air
continually
escaping
from
the
ceiling
up
the
chimney
another
very
simple
method
of
ventilation
is
employed
in
those
excellent
cottages
which
her
majesty
has
built
for
her
labourers
round
windsor
over
each
door
a
sheet
of
perforated
zinc
some
inches
square
is
fixed
allowing
the
foul
air
to
escape
into
the
passage
and
in
the
ceiling
of
the
passage
a
similar
sheet
of
zinc
allowing
it
to
escape
into
the
roof
fresh
air
meanwhile
should
be
obtained
from
outside
by
piercing
the
windows
or
otherwise
and
here
let
me
give
one
hint
to
all
builders
of
houses
if
possible
let
bedroom
windows
open
at
the
top
as
well
as
at
the
bottom
let
me
impress
the
necessity
of
using
some
such
contrivances
not
only
on
parents
and
educators
but
on
those
who
employ
and
above
all
on
those
who
employ
young
women
in
shops
or
in
what
their
condition
may
be
in
this
city
i
know
not
but
most
painful
it
has
been
to
me
in
other
places
when
passing
through
warehouses
or
to
see
the
pale
sodden
and
as
the
french
would
say
etiolated
countenances
of
the
girls
who
were
passing
the
greater
part
of
the
day
in
them
and
painful
also
to
breathe
an
atmosphere
of
which
habit
had
alas
made
them
unconscious
but
which
to
one
coming
out
of
the
open
air
was
altogether
noxious
and
shocking
also
for
it
was
fostering
the
seeds
of
death
not
only
in
the
present
but
in
future
generations
why
should
this
be
every
one
will
agree
that
good
ventilation
is
necessary
in
a
hospital
because
people
can
not
get
well
without
fresh
air
do
they
not
see
that
by
the
same
reasoning
good
ventilation
is
necessary
everywhere
because
people
can
not
remain
well
without
fresh
air
let
me
entreat
those
who
employ
women
in
if
they
have
no
time
to
read
through
such
books
as
andrew
combe
applied
to
health
and
education
and
madame
de
wahl
hints
on
the
moral
mental
and
physical
training
of
girls
to
procure
certain
tracts
published
by
jarrold
paternoster
row
for
the
sanitary
association
especially
one
which
bears
on
this
subject
in
our
own
bedrooms
lankester
manual
of
health
or
a
manual
on
ventilation
published
by
the
metropolitan
working
classes
association
for
the
improvement
of
public
health
i
look
forward
i
say
it
openly
to
some
period
of
higher
civilisation
when
the
acts
of
parliament
for
the
ventilation
of
factories
and
workshops
shall
be
largely
extended
and
made
far
more
stringent
when
officers
of
public
health
shall
be
empowered
to
enforce
the
ventilation
of
every
room
in
which
persons
are
employed
for
hire
and
empowered
also
to
demand
a
proper
system
of
ventilation
for
every
new
house
whether
in
country
or
in
town
to
that
i
believe
we
must
come
but
i
had
sooner
far
see
these
improvements
carried
out
as
befits
the
citizens
of
a
free
country
in
the
spirit
of
the
gospel
rather
than
in
that
of
the
law
carried
out
not
compulsorily
and
from
fear
of
fines
but
voluntarily
from
a
sense
of
duty
honour
and
humanity
i
appeal
therefore
to
the
good
feeling
of
all
whom
it
may
concern
whether
the
health
of
those
whom
they
employ
and
therefore
the
supply
of
fresh
air
which
they
absolutely
need
are
not
matters
for
which
they
are
not
more
or
less
responsible
to
their
country
and
their
god
and
if
any
excellent
person
of
the
old
school
should
answer
me
why
make
all
this
fuss
about
ventilation
our
forefathers
got
on
very
well
without
it
i
must
answer
that
begging
their
pardons
our
ancestors
did
nothing
of
the
kind
our
ancestors
got
on
usually
very
ill
in
these
matters
and
when
they
got
on
well
it
was
because
they
had
good
ventilation
in
spite
of
themselves
first
they
got
on
very
to
quote
a
few
remarkable
instances
of
longevity
or
to
tell
me
that
men
were
larger
and
stronger
on
the
average
in
old
times
is
to
yield
to
the
old
fallacy
of
fancying
that
savages
were
peculiarly
healthy
because
those
who
were
seen
were
active
and
strong
the
simple
answer
is
that
the
strong
alone
survived
while
the
majority
died
from
the
severity
of
the
training
savages
do
not
increase
in
number
and
our
ancestors
increased
but
very
slowly
for
many
centuries
i
am
not
going
to
disgust
my
audience
with
statistics
of
disease
but
knowing
something
as
i
happen
to
do
of
the
social
state
and
of
the
health
of
the
middle
and
elizabethan
ages
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
the
average
of
disease
and
death
was
far
greater
then
than
it
is
now
epidemics
of
many
kinds
typhus
ague
plague
all
diseases
which
were
caused
more
or
less
by
bad
air
devastated
this
land
and
europe
in
those
days
with
a
horrible
intensity
to
which
even
the
choleras
of
our
times
are
mild
the
back
streets
the
hospitals
the
gaols
the
barracks
the
camps
every
place
in
which
any
large
number
of
persons
congregated
were
so
many
nests
of
pestilence
engendered
by
uncleanliness
which
denied
alike
the
water
which
was
drunk
and
the
air
which
was
breathed
and
as
a
single
fact
of
which
the
tables
of
insurance
companies
assure
us
the
average
of
human
life
in
england
has
increased
per
cent
since
the
reign
of
george
owing
simply
to
our
more
rational
and
cleanly
habits
of
life
but
secondly
i
said
that
when
our
ancestors
got
on
well
they
did
so
because
they
got
ventilation
in
spite
of
themselves
luckily
for
them
their
houses
were
their
doors
and
windows
would
not
shut
they
had
houses
too
to
live
in
one
of
which
as
i
can
testify
from
long
experience
is
as
thoroughly
ventilating
as
living
in
a
lantern
with
the
horn
broken
out
it
was
because
their
houses
were
full
of
draughts
and
still
more
in
the
early
middle
age
because
they
had
no
glass
and
stopped
out
the
air
only
by
a
shutter
at
night
that
they
sought
for
shelter
rather
than
for
fresh
air
of
which
they
sometimes
had
too
much
and
to
escape
the
wind
built
their
houses
in
holes
such
as
that
in
which
the
old
city
of
winchester
stands
shelter
i
believe
as
much
as
the
desire
to
be
near
fish
in
lent
and
to
occupy
the
rich
alluvium
of
the
valleys
made
the
monks
of
old
england
choose
the
banks
for
the
sites
of
their
abbeys
they
made
a
mistake
therein
which
like
most
mistakes
did
not
go
unpunished
these
low
situations
especially
while
the
forests
were
yet
thick
on
the
hills
around
were
the
perennial
haunts
of
fever
and
ague
produced
by
subtle
vegetable
poisons
carried
in
the
carbonic
acid
given
off
by
rotting
vegetation
so
there
again
they
fell
in
with
man
old
enemy
bad
air
still
as
long
as
the
doors
and
windows
did
not
shut
some
free
circulation
of
air
remained
but
now
our
doors
and
windows
shut
only
too
tight
we
have
instead
of
lattices
and
we
have
replaced
the
draughty
and
smoky
but
really
wholesome
open
chimney
with
its
wide
corners
and
settles
by
narrow
registers
and
even
by
stoves
we
have
done
all
we
can
in
fact
to
seal
ourselves
up
hermetically
from
the
outer
air
and
to
breathe
our
own
breaths
over
and
over
again
and
we
pay
the
penalty
of
it
in
a
thousand
ways
unknown
to
our
ancestors
through
whose
rooms
all
the
winds
of
heaven
whistled
and
who
were
glad
enough
to
shelter
themselves
from
draughts
in
the
by
the
high
screen
round
the
fire
and
in
the
by
the
thick
curtains
of
the
bedstead
which
is
now
rapidly
disappearing
before
a
higher
civilisation
we
therefore
absolutely
require
to
make
for
ourselves
the
very
ventilation
from
which
our
ancestors
tried
to
escape
but
ladies
there
is
an
old
and
true
proverb
that
you
may
bring
a
horse
to
the
water
but
you
can
not
make
him
drink
and
in
like
wise
it
is
too
true
that
you
may
bring
people
to
the
fresh
air
but
you
can
not
make
them
breathe
it
their
own
folly
or
the
folly
of
their
parents
and
educators
prevents
their
lungs
being
duly
filled
and
duly
emptied
therefore
the
blood
is
not
duly
oxygenated
and
the
whole
system
goes
wrong
paleness
weakness
consumption
scrofula
and
too
many
other
ailments
are
the
consequences
of
lungs
for
without
lungs
robust
health
is
impossible
and
if
any
one
shall
answer
we
do
not
want
robust
health
so
much
as
intellectual
attainment
the
mortal
body
being
the
lower
organ
must
take
its
chance
and
be
even
sacrificed
if
need
be
to
the
higher
organ
the
immortal
mind
to
such
i
reply
you
can
not
do
it
the
laws
of
nature
which
are
the
express
will
of
god
laugh
such
attempts
to
scorn
every
organ
of
the
body
is
formed
out
of
the
blood
and
if
the
blood
be
vitiated
every
organ
suffers
in
proportion
to
its
delicacy
and
the
brain
being
the
most
delicate
and
highly
specialised
of
all
organs
suffers
most
of
all
and
soonest
of
all
as
every
one
knows
who
has
tried
to
work
his
brain
when
his
digestion
was
the
least
out
of
order
nay
the
very
morals
will
suffer
from
lungs
which
signify
repaired
blood
arise
year
by
year
an
amount
not
merely
of
disease
but
of
folly
temper
laziness
intemperance
madness
and
let
me
tell
you
fairly
crime
the
sum
of
which
will
never
be
known
till
that
great
day
when
men
shall
be
called
to
account
for
all
deeds
done
in
the
body
whether
they
be
good
or
evil
i
must
refer
you
on
this
subject
again
to
andrew
combe
especially
chapters
iv
and
vii
and
also
to
chapter
of
madame
de
wahl
excellent
book
i
will
only
say
this
shortly
that
the
three
most
common
causes
of
lungs
in
children
and
in
young
ladies
are
stillness
silence
and
stays
first
stillness
a
sedentary
life
and
want
of
exercise
a
girl
is
kept
for
hours
sitting
on
a
form
writing
or
reading
to
do
which
she
must
lean
forward
and
if
her
schoolmistress
cruelly
attempts
to
make
her
sit
upright
and
thereby
keep
the
spine
in
an
attitude
for
which
nature
did
not
intend
it
she
is
thereby
doing
her
best
to
bring
on
that
disease
so
fearfully
common
in
girls
schools
lateral
curvature
of
the
spine
but
practically
the
girl
will
stoop
forward
and
what
happens
the
lower
ribs
are
pressed
into
the
body
thereby
displacing
more
or
less
something
inside
the
diaphragm
in
the
meantime
which
is
the
very
bellows
of
the
lungs
remains
loose
the
lungs
are
never
properly
filled
or
emptied
and
an
excess
of
carbonic
acid
accumulates
at
the
bottom
of
them
what
follows
frequent
sighing
to
get
rid
of
it
heaviness
of
head
depression
of
the
whole
nervous
system
under
the
influence
of
the
poison
of
the
lungs
and
when
the
poor
child
gets
up
from
her
weary
work
what
is
the
first
thing
she
probably
does
she
lifts
up
her
chest
stretches
yawns
and
breathes
deeply
nature
voice
nature
instinctive
cure
which
is
probably
regarded
as
ungraceful
as
what
is
called
lolling
is
as
if
sitting
upright
was
not
an
attitude
in
itself
essentially
ungraceful
and
such
as
no
artist
would
care
to
draw
as
if
lolling
which
means
putting
the
body
in
the
attitude
of
the
most
perfect
ease
compatible
with
a
fully
expanded
chest
was
not
in
itself
essentially
graceful
and
to
be
seen
in
every
reposing
figure
in
greek
and
vases
graceful
and
like
all
graceful
actions
healthful
at
the
same
time
the
only
tolerably
wholesome
attitude
of
repose
which
i
see
allowed
in
average
is
lying
on
the
back
on
the
floor
or
on
a
sloping
board
in
which
case
the
lungs
must
be
fully
expanded
but
even
so
a
pillow
or
some
equivalent
ought
to
be
placed
under
the
small
of
the
back
or
the
spine
will
be
strained
at
its
very
weakest
point
i
now
go
on
to
the
second
mistake
enforced
silence
moderate
reading
aloud
is
good
but
where
there
is
any
tendency
to
irritability
of
throat
or
lungs
too
much
moderation
can
not
be
used
you
may
as
well
try
to
cure
a
diseased
lung
by
working
it
as
to
cure
a
lame
horse
by
galloping
him
but
where
the
breathing
organs
are
of
average
health
let
it
be
said
once
and
for
all
that
children
and
young
people
can
not
make
too
much
noise
the
parents
who
can
not
bear
the
noise
of
their
children
have
no
right
to
have
brought
them
into
the
world
the
schoolmistress
who
enforces
silence
on
her
pupils
is
committing
unintentionally
no
doubt
but
still
committing
an
offence
against
reason
worthy
only
of
a
convent
every
shout
every
burst
of
laughter
every
song
nay
in
the
case
of
infants
as
physiologists
well
know
every
moderate
fit
of
crying
conduces
to
health
by
rapidly
filling
and
emptying
the
lung
and
changing
the
blood
more
rapidly
from
black
to
red
that
is
from
death
to
life
andrew
combe
tells
a
story
of
a
large
charity
school
in
which
the
young
girls
were
for
the
sake
of
their
health
shut
up
in
the
hall
and
during
play
hours
from
november
till
march
and
no
romping
or
noise
allowed
the
natural
consequences
were
the
great
majority
of
them
fell
ill
and
i
am
afraid
that
a
great
deal
of
illness
has
been
from
time
to
time
contracted
in
certain
simply
through
this
one
cause
of
enforced
silence
some
cause
or
other
there
must
be
for
the
amount
of
and
weakliness
which
prevails
especially
among
girls
of
the
middle
classes
in
towns
who
have
not
poor
things
the
opportunities
which
richer
girls
have
of
keeping
themselves
in
strong
health
by
riding
skating
archery
that
last
quite
an
admirable
exercise
for
the
chest
and
lungs
and
far
preferable
to
croquet
which
involves
too
much
unwholesome
even
playing
at
ball
if
milliners
and
had
room
to
indulge
in
one
after
their
sedentary
work
might
bring
fresh
spirits
to
many
a
heart
and
fresh
colour
to
many
a
cheek
i
spoke
just
now
of
the
greeks
i
suppose
you
will
all
allow
that
the
greeks
were
as
far
as
we
know
the
most
beautiful
race
which
the
world
ever
saw
every
educated
man
knows
that
they
were
also
the
cleverest
of
all
races
and
next
to
his
bible
thanks
god
for
greek
literature
now
these
people
had
made
physical
as
well
as
intellectual
education
a
science
as
well
as
a
study
their
women
practised
graceful
and
in
some
cases
even
athletic
exercises
they
developed
by
a
free
and
healthy
life
those
figures
which
remain
everlasting
and
unapproachable
models
of
human
beauty
but
to
come
to
my
third
point
they
wore
no
stays
the
first
mention
of
stays
that
i
have
ever
found
is
in
the
letters
of
dear
old
synesius
bishop
of
cyrene
on
the
greek
coast
of
africa
about
four
hundred
years
after
the
christian
era
he
tells
us
how
when
he
was
shipwrecked
on
a
remote
part
of
the
coast
and
he
and
the
rest
of
the
passengers
were
starving
on
cockles
and
limpets
there
was
among
them
a
slave
girl
out
of
the
far
east
who
had
a
pinched
such
as
you
may
see
on
the
old
hindoo
sculptures
and
such
as
you
may
see
in
any
street
in
a
british
town
and
when
the
greek
ladies
of
the
neighbourhood
found
her
out
they
sent
for
her
from
house
to
house
to
behold
with
astonishment
and
laughter
this
new
and
prodigious
waist
with
which
it
seemed
to
them
it
was
impossible
for
a
human
being
to
breathe
or
live
and
they
petted
the
poor
girl
and
fed
her
as
they
might
a
dwarf
or
a
giantess
till
she
got
quite
fat
and
comfortable
while
her
owners
had
not
enough
to
eat
so
strange
and
ridiculous
seemed
our
present
fashion
to
the
descendants
of
those
who
centuries
before
had
imagined
because
they
had
seen
living
and
moving
those
glorious
statues
which
we
pretend
to
admire
but
refuse
to
imitate
it
seems
to
me
that
a
few
centuries
hence
when
mankind
has
learnt
to
fear
god
more
and
therefore
to
obey
more
strictly
those
laws
of
nature
and
of
science
which
are
the
will
of
god
it
seems
to
me
i
say
that
in
those
days
the
present
fashion
of
tight
lacing
will
be
looked
back
upon
as
a
contemptible
and
barbarous
superstition
denoting
a
very
low
level
of
civilisation
in
the
peoples
which
have
practised
it
that
for
generations
past
women
should
have
been
in
the
habit
not
to
please
men
who
do
not
care
about
the
matter
as
a
point
of
beauty
but
simply
to
vie
with
each
other
in
obedience
to
something
called
fashion
that
they
should
i
say
have
been
in
the
habit
of
deliberately
crushing
that
part
of
the
body
which
should
be
specially
left
free
contracting
and
displacing
their
lungs
their
heart
and
all
the
most
vital
and
important
organs
and
entailing
thereby
disease
not
only
on
themselves
but
on
their
children
after
them
that
for
forty
years
past
physicians
should
have
been
telling
them
of
the
folly
of
what
they
have
been
doing
and
that
they
should
as
yet
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
not
only
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
all
warnings
but
actually
deny
the
offence
of
which
one
glance
of
the
physician
or
the
sculptor
who
know
what
shape
the
human
body
ought
to
be
brings
them
in
guilty
this
i
say
is
an
instance
of
what
shall
i
call
it
which
deserves
at
once
the
lash
not
merely
of
the
satirist
but
of
any
theologian
who
really
believes
that
god
made
the
physical
universe
let
me
i
pray
you
appeal
to
your
common
sense
for
a
moment
when
any
one
chooses
a
horse
or
a
dog
whether
for
strength
for
speed
or
for
any
other
useful
purpose
the
first
thing
almost
to
be
looked
at
is
the
girth
round
the
ribs
the
room
for
heart
and
lungs
exactly
in
proportion
to
that
will
be
the
animal
general
healthiness
power
of
endurance
and
value
in
many
other
ways
if
you
will
look
at
eminent
lawyers
and
famous
orators
who
have
attained
a
healthy
old
age
you
will
see
that
in
every
case
they
are
men
like
the
late
lord
palmerston
and
others
whom
i
could
mention
of
remarkable
size
not
merely
in
the
upper
but
in
the
lower
part
of
the
chest
men
who
had
therefore
a
peculiar
power
of
using
the
diaphragm
to
fill
and
to
clear
the
lungs
and
therefore
to
oxygenate
the
blood
of
the
whole
body
now
it
is
just
these
lower
ribs
across
which
the
diaphragm
is
stretched
like
the
head
of
a
drum
which
stays
contract
to
a
minimum
if
you
advised
owners
of
horses
and
hounds
to
put
their
horses
or
their
hounds
into
stays
and
lace
them
up
tight
in
order
to
increase
their
beauty
you
would
receive
i
doubt
not
a
very
courteous
but
certainly
a
very
decided
refusal
to
do
that
which
would
spoil
not
merely
the
animals
themselves
but
the
whole
stud
or
the
whole
kennel
for
years
to
come
and
if
you
advised
an
orator
to
put
himself
into
tight
stays
he
no
doubt
again
would
give
a
courteous
answer
but
he
would
reply
if
he
was
a
really
educated
man
that
to
comply
with
your
request
would
involve
his
giving
up
public
work
under
the
probable
penalty
of
being
dead
within
the
twelvemonth
and
how
much
work
of
every
kind
intellectual
as
well
as
physical
is
spoiled
or
hindered
how
many
deaths
occur
from
consumption
and
other
complaints
which
are
the
result
of
this
habit
of
tight
lacing
is
known
partly
to
the
medical
men
who
lift
up
their
voices
in
vain
and
known
fully
to
him
who
will
not
interfere
with
the
least
of
his
own
physical
laws
to
save
human
beings
from
the
consequences
of
their
own
wilful
folly
and
now
to
end
this
lecture
with
more
pleasing
thoughts
what
becomes
of
this
breath
which
passes
from
your
lips
is
it
merely
harmful
merely
waste
god
forbid
god
has
forbidden
that
anything
should
be
merely
harmful
or
merely
waste
in
this
so
wise
and
world
the
carbonic
acid
which
passes
from
your
lips
at
every
breath
ay
even
that
which
oozes
from
the
volcano
crater
when
the
eruption
is
past
is
a
precious
boon
to
thousands
of
things
of
which
you
have
daily
need
indeed
there
is
a
sort
of
hint
at
physical
truth
in
the
old
fairy
tale
of
the
girl
from
whose
lips
as
she
spoke
fell
pearls
and
diamonds
for
the
carbonic
acid
of
your
breath
may
help
hereafter
to
make
the
pure
carbonate
of
lime
of
a
pearl
or
the
still
purer
carbon
of
a
diamond
nay
it
may
go
in
such
a
world
of
transformations
do
we
live
to
make
atoms
of
coal
strata
which
shall
lie
buried
for
ages
beneath
deep
seas
shall
be
upheaved
in
continents
which
are
yet
unborn
and
there
be
burnt
for
the
use
of
a
future
race
of
men
and
resolved
into
their
original
elements
coal
wise
men
tell
us
is
on
the
whole
breath
and
sunlight
the
breath
of
living
creatures
who
have
lived
in
the
vast
swamps
and
forests
of
some
primaeval
world
and
the
sunlight
which
transmuted
that
breath
into
the
leaves
and
stems
of
trees
magically
locked
up
for
ages
in
that
black
stone
to
become
when
it
is
burnt
at
last
light
and
carbonic
acid
as
it
was
at
first
for
though
you
must
not
breathe
your
breath
again
you
may
at
least
eat
your
breath
if
you
will
allow
the
sun
to
transmute
it
for
you
into
vegetables
or
you
may
enjoy
its
fragrance
and
its
colour
in
the
shape
of
a
lily
or
a
rose
when
you
walk
in
a
sunlit
garden
every
word
you
speak
every
breath
you
breathe
is
feeding
the
plants
and
flowers
around
the
delicate
surface
of
the
green
leaves
absorbs
the
carbonic
acid
and
parts
it
into
its
elements
retaining
the
carbon
to
make
woody
fibre
and
courteously
returning
you
the
oxygen
to
mingle
with
the
fresh
air
and
be
inhaled
by
your
lungs
once
more
thus
do
you
feed
the
plants
just
as
the
plants
feed
you
while
the
great
giving
sun
feeds
both
and
the
geranium
standing
in
the
sick
window
does
not
merely
rejoice
his
eye
and
mind
by
its
beauty
and
freshness
but
repays
honestly
the
trouble
spent
on
it
absorbing
the
breath
which
the
child
needs
not
and
giving
to
him
the
breath
which
he
needs
so
are
the
services
of
all
things
constituted
according
to
a
divine
and
wonderful
order
and
knit
together
in
mutual
dependence
and
mutual
a
fact
to
be
remembered
with
hope
and
comfort
but
also
with
awe
and
fear
for
as
in
that
which
is
above
nature
so
in
nature
itself
he
that
breaks
one
physical
law
is
guilty
of
all
the
whole
universe
as
it
were
takes
up
arms
against
him
and
all
nature
with
her
numberless
and
unseen
powers
is
ready
to
avenge
herself
on
him
and
on
his
children
after
him
he
knows
not
when
nor
where
he
on
the
other
hand
who
obeys
the
laws
of
nature
with
his
whole
heart
and
mind
will
find
all
things
working
together
to
him
for
good
he
is
at
peace
with
the
physical
universe
he
is
helped
and
befriended
alike
by
the
sun
above
his
head
and
the
dust
beneath
his
feet
because
he
is
obeying
the
will
and
mind
of
him
who
made
sun
and
dust
and
all
things
and
who
has
given
them
a
law
which
can
not
be
broken
the
tree
of
knowledge
the
more
i
have
contemplated
that
ancient
story
of
the
fall
the
more
it
has
seemed
to
me
within
the
range
of
probability
and
even
of
experience
it
must
have
happened
somewhere
for
the
first
time
for
it
has
happened
only
too
many
times
since
it
has
happened
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain
in
every
race
and
every
age
and
every
grade
of
civilisation
it
is
happening
round
us
now
in
every
region
of
the
globe
always
and
everywhere
it
seems
to
me
have
poor
human
beings
been
tempted
to
eat
of
some
tree
of
knowledge
that
they
may
be
even
for
an
hour
as
gods
wise
but
with
a
false
wisdom
careless
but
with
a
frantic
carelessness
and
happy
but
with
a
happiness
which
when
the
excitement
is
past
leaves
too
often
as
with
that
hapless
pair
in
eden
depression
shame
and
fear
everywhere
and
in
all
ages
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain
has
man
been
inventing
stimulants
and
narcotics
to
supply
that
want
of
vitality
of
which
he
is
so
painfully
aware
and
has
asked
nature
and
not
god
to
clear
the
dull
brain
and
comfort
the
weary
spirit
this
has
been
and
will
be
perhaps
for
many
a
century
to
come
almost
the
most
fearful
failing
of
this
poor
exceptional
diseased
and
truly
fallen
being
called
man
who
is
in
doubt
daily
whether
he
be
a
god
or
an
ape
and
in
trying
wildly
to
become
the
former
ends
but
too
often
in
becoming
the
latter
for
man
whether
savage
or
civilised
feels
and
has
felt
in
every
age
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
him
he
usually
confesses
this
fact
as
is
to
be
expected
of
his
rather
than
of
himself
and
shows
his
sense
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
them
by
complaining
of
hating
and
killing
them
but
he
can
not
always
conceal
from
himself
the
fact
that
he
too
is
wrong
as
well
as
they
and
as
he
will
not
usually
kill
himself
he
tries
wild
ways
to
make
himself
at
least
feel
if
not
to
be
somewhat
better
philosophers
may
bid
him
be
content
and
tell
him
that
he
is
what
he
ought
to
be
and
what
nature
has
made
him
but
he
cares
nothing
for
the
philosophers
he
knows
usually
that
he
is
not
what
he
ought
to
be
that
he
carries
about
with
him
in
most
cases
a
body
more
or
less
diseased
and
decrepit
incapable
of
doing
all
the
work
which
he
feels
that
he
himself
could
do
or
expressing
all
the
emotions
which
he
himself
longs
to
express
a
dull
brain
and
dull
senses
which
cramp
the
eager
infinity
within
him
as
so
goethe
once
said
with
pity
the
horse
single
hoof
cramps
the
fine
intelligence
and
generosity
of
his
nature
and
forbids
him
even
to
grasp
an
object
like
the
more
stupid
cat
and
baser
monkey
and
man
has
a
self
too
within
from
which
he
longs
too
often
to
escape
as
from
a
household
ghost
who
pulls
out
at
unfortunately
rude
and
unwelcome
hours
the
ledger
of
memory
and
so
when
the
tempter
be
he
who
he
may
says
to
him
take
this
and
you
will
better
take
this
and
you
shall
be
as
gods
knowing
good
and
evil
then
if
the
temptation
was
as
the
old
story
says
too
much
for
man
while
healthy
and
unfallen
what
must
it
be
for
his
unhealthy
and
fallen
children
in
vain
we
say
to
man
is
life
not
death
for
which
you
pant
is
life
whereof
your
nerves
are
scant
more
life
and
fuller
that
you
want
and
your
tree
of
knowledge
is
not
the
tree
of
life
it
is
in
every
case
the
tree
of
death
of
decrepitude
madness
misery
he
prefers
the
voice
of
the
tempter
thou
shalt
not
surely
die
nay
he
will
say
at
last
better
be
as
gods
awhile
and
die
than
be
the
crawling
insufficient
thing
i
am
and
live
he
did
i
say
alas
i
must
say
she
likewise
the
sacred
story
is
only
too
true
to
fact
when
it
represents
the
woman
as
falling
not
merely
at
the
same
time
as
the
man
but
before
the
man
only
let
us
remember
that
it
represents
the
woman
as
tempted
tempted
seemingly
by
a
rational
being
of
lower
race
and
yet
of
superior
cunning
who
must
therefore
have
fallen
before
the
woman
who
or
what
the
being
was
who
is
called
the
serpent
in
our
translation
of
genesis
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
we
have
absolutely
i
think
no
facts
from
which
to
judge
and
rabbinical
traditions
need
trouble
no
man
much
but
i
fancy
that
a
missionary
preaching
on
this
story
to
negroes
telling
them
plainly
that
the
serpent
meant
the
first
obeah
man
and
then
comparing
the
experiences
of
that
hapless
pair
in
eden
with
their
own
after
certain
orgies
not
yet
extinct
in
africa
and
elsewhere
would
be
only
too
well
understood
so
well
indeed
that
he
might
run
some
risk
of
eating
himself
not
of
the
tree
of
life
but
of
that
of
death
the
sorcerer
or
sorceress
tempting
the
woman
and
then
the
woman
tempting
the
man
this
seems
to
be
certainly
among
savage
peoples
and
alas
too
often
among
civilised
peoples
also
the
usual
course
of
the
tragedy
but
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
the
woman
yielding
before
the
man
is
not
altogether
to
her
dishonour
as
those
old
monks
used
to
allege
who
hated
and
too
often
tortured
the
sex
whom
they
could
not
enjoy
it
is
not
to
the
woman
dishonour
if
she
felt
before
her
husband
higher
aspirations
than
those
after
mere
animal
pleasure
to
be
as
gods
knowing
good
and
evil
is
a
vain
and
foolish
but
not
a
base
and
brutal
wish
she
proved
herself
thereby
though
at
an
awful
cost
a
woman
and
not
an
animal
and
indeed
the
woman
more
delicate
organisation
her
more
vivid
emotions
her
more
voluble
fancy
as
well
as
her
mere
physical
weakness
and
weariness
have
been
to
her
in
all
ages
a
special
source
of
temptation
which
it
is
to
her
honour
that
she
has
resisted
so
much
better
than
the
physically
stronger
and
therefore
more
culpable
man
as
for
what
the
tree
of
knowledge
was
there
really
is
no
need
for
us
to
waste
our
time
in
guessing
if
it
was
not
one
plant
then
it
was
another
it
may
have
been
something
which
has
long
since
perished
off
the
earth
it
may
have
been
as
some
learned
men
have
guessed
the
sacred
soma
or
homa
of
the
early
brahmin
race
and
that
may
have
been
a
still
existing
narcotic
species
of
asclepias
it
certainly
was
not
the
vine
the
language
of
the
hebrew
scripture
concerning
it
and
the
sacred
use
to
which
it
is
consecrated
in
the
gospels
forbid
that
notion
utterly
at
least
to
those
who
know
enough
of
antiquity
to
pass
by
with
a
smile
the
theory
that
the
wines
mentioned
in
scripture
were
not
intoxicating
and
yet
as
a
fresh
corroboration
of
what
i
am
trying
to
say
how
fearfully
has
that
noble
gift
to
man
been
abused
for
the
same
end
as
a
hundred
other
vegetable
products
ever
since
those
mythic
days
when
dionusos
brought
the
vine
from
the
far
east
amid
troops
of
human
maenads
and
satyrs
and
the
bacchae
tore
pentheus
in
pieces
on
cithaeron
for
daring
to
intrude
upon
their
sacred
rites
and
since
those
historic
days
too
when
less
than
two
hundred
years
before
the
christian
era
the
bacchic
rites
spread
from
southern
italy
into
etruria
and
thence
to
the
matrons
of
rome
and
under
the
guidance
of
poenia
annia
a
campanian
lady
took
at
last
shapes
of
which
no
man
must
speak
but
which
had
to
be
put
down
with
terrible
but
just
severity
by
the
consuls
and
the
senate
but
it
matters
little
i
say
what
this
same
tree
of
knowledge
was
was
every
vine
on
earth
destroyed
and
every
vegetable
also
from
which
alcohol
is
now
distilled
man
would
soon
discover
something
else
wherewith
to
satisfy
the
insatiate
craving
has
he
not
done
so
already
has
not
almost
every
people
had
its
tree
of
knowledge
often
more
deadly
than
any
distilled
liquor
from
the
absinthe
of
the
cultivated
frenchman
and
the
opium
of
the
cultivated
chinese
down
to
the
wherewith
the
tropic
sorcerer
initiates
his
dupes
into
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
and
the
fungus
from
which
the
samoiede
extracts
in
autumn
a
few
days
of
brutal
happiness
before
the
setting
in
of
the
long
six
months
night
god
grant
that
modern
science
may
not
bring
to
light
fresh
substitutes
for
alcohol
opium
and
the
rest
and
give
the
white
races
in
that
state
of
effeminate
and
godless
which
i
sometimes
fear
is
creeping
upon
them
fresh
means
of
destroying
themselves
delicately
and
pleasantly
off
the
face
of
the
earth
it
is
said
by
some
that
drunkenness
is
on
the
increase
in
this
island
i
have
no
trusty
proof
of
it
but
i
can
believe
it
possible
for
every
cause
of
drunkenness
seems
on
the
increase
overwork
of
body
and
mind
circumstances
which
depress
health
temptation
to
drink
and
drink
again
at
every
corner
of
the
streets
and
finally
money
and
ever
more
money
in
the
hands
of
uneducated
people
who
have
not
the
desire
and
too
often
not
the
means
of
spending
it
in
any
save
the
lowest
pleasures
these
it
seems
to
me
are
the
true
causes
of
drunkenness
increasing
or
not
and
if
we
wish
to
become
a
more
temperate
nation
we
must
lessen
them
if
we
can
not
eradicate
them
first
overwork
we
all
live
too
fast
and
work
too
hard
all
things
are
full
of
labour
man
can
not
utter
it
in
the
heavy
struggle
for
existence
which
goes
on
all
around
us
each
man
is
tasked
more
and
more
if
he
be
really
worth
buying
and
using
to
the
utmost
of
his
powers
all
day
long
the
weak
have
to
compete
on
equal
terms
with
the
strong
and
crave
in
consequence
for
artificial
strength
how
we
shall
stop
that
i
know
not
while
every
man
is
making
haste
to
be
rich
and
piercing
himself
through
with
many
sorrows
and
falling
into
foolish
and
hurtful
lusts
which
drown
men
in
destruction
and
perdition
how
we
shall
stop
that
i
say
i
know
not
the
old
prophet
may
have
been
right
when
he
said
surely
it
is
not
of
the
lord
that
the
people
shall
labour
in
the
very
fire
and
weary
themselves
for
very
vanity
and
in
some
juster
wiser
more
sober
system
of
society
somewhat
more
like
the
kingdom
of
the
father
come
on
earth
it
may
be
that
poor
human
beings
will
not
need
to
toil
so
hard
and
to
keep
themselves
up
to
their
work
by
stimulants
but
will
have
time
to
sit
down
and
look
around
them
and
think
of
god
and
of
god
quiet
universe
with
something
of
quiet
in
themselves
something
of
rational
leisure
and
manful
sobriety
of
mind
as
well
as
of
body
but
it
seems
to
me
also
that
in
such
a
state
of
society
when
as
it
was
once
well
put
every
one
has
stopped
running
about
like
rats
that
those
who
work
hard
whether
with
muscle
or
with
brain
would
not
be
surrounded
as
now
with
every
circumstance
which
tempts
toward
drink
by
every
circumstance
which
depresses
the
vital
energies
and
leaves
them
an
easy
prey
to
pestilence
itself
by
bad
light
bad
air
bad
food
bad
water
bad
smells
bad
occupations
which
weaken
the
muscles
cramp
the
chest
disorder
the
digestion
let
any
rational
man
fresh
from
the
country
in
which
i
presume
god
having
made
it
meant
all
men
more
or
less
to
live
go
through
the
back
streets
of
any
city
or
through
whole
districts
of
the
black
countries
of
england
and
then
ask
himself
is
it
the
will
of
god
that
his
human
children
should
live
and
toil
in
such
dens
such
deserts
such
dark
places
of
the
earth
let
him
ask
himself
can
they
live
and
toil
there
without
contracting
a
probably
diseased
habit
of
body
without
contracting
a
certainly
dull
weary
sordid
habit
of
mind
which
craves
for
any
pleasure
however
brutal
to
escape
from
its
own
stupidity
and
emptiness
when
i
run
through
by
rail
certain
parts
of
the
country
streets
of
furnaces
collieries
slag
heaps
mud
slop
brick
smoke
dirt
and
that
is
all
and
when
i
am
told
whether
truly
or
falsely
that
the
main
thing
which
the
and
men
of
those
abominable
wastes
care
for
is
good
i
can
only
answer
that
i
am
not
surprised
i
say
as
i
have
said
elsewhere
and
shall
do
my
best
to
say
again
that
the
craving
for
drink
and
narcotics
especially
that
engendered
in
our
great
cities
is
not
a
disease
but
a
symptom
of
disease
of
a
far
deeper
disease
than
any
which
drunkenness
can
produce
namely
of
the
growing
degeneracy
of
a
population
striving
in
vain
by
stimulants
and
narcotics
to
fight
against
those
slow
poisons
with
which
our
greedy
barbarism
miscalled
civilisation
has
surrounded
them
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
i
may
be
answered
that
the
old
german
angle
dane
drank
heavily
i
know
it
but
why
did
they
drink
save
for
the
same
reason
that
the
fenman
drank
and
his
wife
took
opium
at
least
till
the
fens
were
drained
why
but
to
keep
off
the
depressing
effects
of
the
malaria
of
swamps
and
new
clearings
which
told
on
them
who
always
settled
in
the
lowest
grounds
in
the
shape
of
fever
and
ague
here
it
may
be
answered
again
that
stimulants
have
been
during
the
memory
of
man
the
destruction
of
the
red
indian
race
in
america
i
reply
boldly
that
i
do
not
believe
it
there
is
evidence
enough
in
jaques
cartier
to
the
rivers
of
canada
and
evidence
more
than
enough
in
strachey
in
virginia
to
quote
only
two
authorities
out
of
many
to
prove
that
the
red
indians
when
the
white
man
first
met
with
them
were
in
north
and
south
alike
a
diseased
decaying
and
as
all
their
traditions
confess
decreasing
race
such
a
race
would
naturally
crave
for
the
water
of
life
the
or
whisky
as
we
have
contracted
the
old
name
now
but
i
should
have
thought
that
the
white
man
by
introducing
among
these
poor
creatures
iron
blankets
and
above
all
horses
wherewith
to
follow
the
which
they
could
never
follow
on
foot
must
have
done
ten
times
more
towards
keeping
them
alive
than
he
has
done
towards
destroying
them
by
giving
them
the
chance
of
a
drunkenness
twice
a
year
when
they
came
in
to
his
forts
to
sell
the
skins
which
without
his
gifts
they
would
never
have
got
such
a
race
would
of
course
if
wanting
vitality
crave
for
stimulants
but
if
the
stimulants
and
not
the
original
want
of
vitality
combined
with
morals
utterly
detestable
and
worthy
only
of
the
gallows
and
here
i
know
what
i
say
and
dare
not
tell
what
i
know
from
have
been
the
cause
of
the
red
indians
extinction
then
how
is
it
let
me
ask
that
the
irishman
and
the
scotsman
have
often
to
their
great
harm
been
drinking
as
much
whisky
and
usually
very
bad
whisky
not
merely
twice
a
year
but
as
often
as
they
could
get
it
during
the
whole
iron
age
and
for
aught
any
one
can
tell
during
the
bronze
age
and
the
stone
age
before
that
and
yet
are
still
the
most
healthy
able
valiant
and
prolific
races
in
europe
had
they
drunk
less
whisky
they
would
doubtless
have
been
more
healthy
able
valiant
and
perhaps
even
more
prolific
than
they
are
now
they
show
no
sign
however
as
yet
of
going
the
way
of
the
red
indian
but
if
the
craving
for
stimulants
and
narcotics
is
a
token
of
deficient
vitality
then
the
deadliest
foe
of
that
craving
and
all
its
miserable
results
is
surely
the
sanatory
reformer
the
man
who
preaches
and
as
far
as
ignorance
and
vested
interests
will
allow
him
procures
for
the
masses
pure
air
pure
sunlight
pure
water
pure
pure
food
not
merely
every
fresh
but
every
fresh
public
bath
and
every
fresh
open
space
every
fresh
growing
tree
every
fresh
open
window
every
fresh
flower
in
that
window
each
of
these
is
so
much
as
the
old
persians
would
have
said
conquered
for
ormuzd
the
god
of
light
and
life
out
of
the
dominion
of
ahriman
the
king
of
darkness
and
of
death
so
much
taken
from
the
causes
of
drunkenness
and
disease
and
added
to
the
causes
of
sobriety
and
health
meanwhile
one
thing
is
clear
that
if
this
present
barbarism
and
anarchy
of
covetousness
miscalled
modern
civilisation
were
tamed
and
drilled
into
something
more
like
a
kingdom
of
god
on
earth
then
we
should
not
see
the
reckless
and
needless
multiplication
of
liquor
shops
which
disgraces
this
country
now
as
a
single
instance
in
one
country
parish
of
nine
hundred
inhabitants
in
which
the
population
has
increased
only
in
the
last
fifty
years
there
are
now
practically
eight
where
fifty
years
ago
there
were
but
two
one
that
is
for
every
hundred
and
ten
or
rather
omitting
children
farmers
shopkeepers
gentlemen
and
their
households
one
for
every
fifty
of
the
inhabitants
in
the
face
of
the
allurements
often
of
the
basest
kind
which
these
dens
offer
the
clergyman
and
the
schoolmaster
struggle
in
vain
to
keep
up
and
young
men
clubs
and
to
inculcate
habits
of
providence
the
young
labourers
over
a
great
part
of
the
south
and
east
at
least
of
england
though
never
so
well
off
for
several
generations
as
they
are
now
are
growing
up
thriftless
shiftless
inferior
it
seems
to
me
to
their
grandfathers
in
everything
save
that
they
can
usually
read
and
write
and
their
grandfathers
could
not
and
that
they
wear
smart
cheap
cloth
clothes
instead
of
their
grandfathers
and
if
it
be
so
in
the
country
how
must
it
be
in
towns
there
must
come
a
thorough
change
in
the
present
licensing
system
in
spite
of
all
the
pressure
which
certain
powerful
vested
interests
may
bring
to
bear
on
governments
and
it
is
the
duty
of
every
good
citizen
who
cares
for
his
countrymen
and
for
their
children
after
them
to
help
in
bringing
about
that
change
as
speedily
as
possible
again
i
said
just
now
that
a
probable
cause
of
increasing
drunkenness
was
the
increasing
material
prosperity
of
thousands
who
knew
no
recreation
beyond
low
animal
pleasure
if
i
am
right
and
i
believe
that
i
am
right
i
must
urge
on
those
who
wish
drunkenness
to
decrease
the
necessity
of
providing
more
and
more
refined
recreation
for
the
people
men
drink
and
women
too
remember
not
merely
to
supply
exhaustion
not
merely
to
drive
away
care
but
often
simply
to
drive
away
dulness
they
have
nothing
to
do
save
to
think
over
what
they
have
done
in
the
day
or
what
they
expect
to
do
and
they
escape
from
that
dreary
round
of
business
thought
in
liquor
or
narcotics
there
are
still
those
by
no
means
of
the
class
but
absorbed
all
day
by
business
who
drink
heavily
at
night
in
their
own
comfortable
homes
simply
to
recreate
their
overburdened
minds
such
cases
doubtless
are
far
less
common
than
they
were
fifty
years
ago
but
why
is
not
the
decrease
of
drinking
among
the
richer
classes
certainly
due
to
the
increased
refinement
and
variety
of
their
tastes
and
occupations
in
cultivating
the
aesthetic
side
of
man
nature
in
engaging
him
with
the
beautiful
the
pure
the
wonderful
the
truly
natural
with
painting
poetry
music
horticulture
physical
science
in
all
this
lies
recreation
in
the
true
and
literal
sense
of
that
word
namely
the
recreating
and
mending
of
the
exhausted
mind
and
feelings
such
as
no
rational
man
will
now
neglect
either
for
himself
his
children
or
his
but
how
little
of
all
this
is
open
to
the
masses
all
should
know
but
too
well
how
little
opportunity
the
average
or
his
wife
has
of
eating
of
any
tree
of
knowledge
save
of
the
very
basest
kind
is
but
too
palpable
we
are
mending
thank
god
in
this
respect
free
libraries
and
museums
have
sprung
up
of
late
in
other
cities
beside
london
god
blessing
rest
upon
them
all
and
the
crystal
palace
and
still
later
the
bethnal
green
museum
have
been
i
believe
of
far
more
use
than
many
average
sermons
and
lectures
from
many
average
orators
but
are
we
not
still
far
behind
the
old
greeks
and
the
romans
of
the
empire
likewise
in
the
amount
of
amusement
and
instruction
and
even
of
shelter
which
we
provide
for
the
people
recollect
the
to
me
disgraceful
fact
that
there
is
not
as
far
as
i
am
aware
throughout
the
whole
of
london
a
single
portico
or
other
covered
place
in
which
the
people
can
take
refuge
during
a
shower
and
this
in
the
climate
of
england
where
they
do
take
refuge
on
a
wet
day
the
publican
knows
but
too
well
as
he
knows
also
where
thousands
of
the
lower
classes
simply
for
want
of
any
other
place
to
be
in
save
their
own
sordid
dwellings
spend
as
much
as
they
are
permitted
of
the
sabbath
day
let
us
put
down
sunday
drinking
by
all
means
if
we
can
but
let
us
remember
that
by
closing
the
on
sunday
we
prevent
no
man
or
woman
from
carrying
home
as
much
poison
as
they
choose
on
saturday
night
to
brutalise
themselves
therewith
perhaps
for
hours
and
let
us
see
in
the
name
of
him
who
said
that
he
had
made
the
sabbath
for
man
and
not
man
for
the
sabbath
let
us
see
i
say
if
we
can
not
do
something
to
prevent
the
townsman
sabbath
being
not
a
day
of
rest
but
a
day
of
mere
idleness
the
day
of
most
temptation
because
of
most
dulness
of
the
whole
seven
and
here
perhaps
some
sweet
soul
may
look
up
reprovingly
and
say
he
talks
of
rest
does
he
forget
and
would
he
have
the
working
man
forget
that
all
these
outward
palliatives
will
never
touch
the
seat
of
the
disease
the
unrest
of
the
soul
within
does
he
forget
and
would
he
have
the
working
man
forget
who
it
was
who
said
who
only
has
the
right
to
say
come
unto
me
all
ye
who
are
weary
and
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
ah
no
sweet
soul
i
know
your
words
are
true
i
know
that
what
we
all
want
is
inward
rest
rest
of
heart
and
brain
the
calm
strong
character
which
needs
no
stimulants
for
it
has
no
fits
of
depression
which
needs
no
narcotics
for
it
has
no
fits
of
excitement
which
needs
no
ascetic
restraints
for
it
is
strong
enough
to
use
god
gifts
without
abusing
them
the
character
in
a
word
which
is
truly
temperate
not
in
drink
or
food
merely
but
in
all
desires
thoughts
and
actions
freed
from
the
wild
lusts
and
ambitions
to
which
that
old
adam
yielded
and
seeking
for
light
and
life
by
means
forbidden
found
thereby
disease
and
death
yes
i
know
that
and
know
too
that
that
rest
is
found
only
where
you
have
already
found
it
and
yet
in
such
a
world
as
this
governed
by
a
being
who
has
made
sunshine
and
flowers
and
green
grass
and
the
song
of
birds
and
happy
human
smiles
and
who
would
educate
by
them
if
we
would
let
him
his
human
children
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
in
such
a
world
as
this
will
you
grudge
any
particle
of
that
education
even
any
harmless
substitute
for
it
to
those
spirits
in
prison
whose
surroundings
too
often
tempt
them
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
to
fancy
that
the
world
is
composed
of
bricks
and
iron
and
governed
by
inspectors
and
policemen
preach
to
those
spirits
in
prison
as
you
know
far
better
than
we
parsons
how
to
preach
but
let
them
have
besides
some
glimpses
of
the
splendid
fact
that
outside
their
is
a
world
which
god
not
man
has
made
wherein
grows
everywhere
that
tree
of
knowledge
which
is
likewise
the
tree
of
life
and
that
they
have
a
right
to
some
small
share
of
its
beauty
and
its
wonder
and
its
rest
for
their
own
health
of
soul
and
body
and
for
the
health
of
their
children
after
them
nausicaa
in
london
or
the
lower
education
of
woman
fresh
from
the
marbles
of
the
british
museum
i
went
my
way
through
london
streets
my
brain
was
still
full
of
fair
and
grand
forms
the
forms
of
men
and
women
whose
every

betokened
perfect
health
and
grace
and
power
and
a
and
so
habitual
and
complete
that
it
had
become
unconscious
and
undistinguishable
from
the
native
freedom
of
the
savage
for
i
had
been
up
and
down
the
corridors
of
those
greek
sculptures
which
remain
as
a
perpetual
sermon
to
rich
and
poor
amid
our
artificial
unwholesome
and
it
may
be
decaying
saying
with
looks
more
expressive
than
all
words
such
men
and
women
can
be
for
such
they
have
been
and
such
you
may
be
yet
if
you
will
use
that
science
of
which
you
too
often
only
boast
above
all
i
had
been
pondering
over
the
awful
and
yet
tender
beauty
of
the
maiden
figures
from
the
parthenon
and
its
kindred
temples
and
these
or
such
as
these
i
thought
to
myself
were
the
sisters
of
the
men
who
fought
at
marathon
and
salamis
the
mothers
of
many
a
man
among
the
ten
thousand
whom
xenophon
led
back
from
babylon
to
the
black
sea
shore
the
ancestresses
of
many
a
man
who
conquered
the
east
in
alexander
host
and
fought
with
porus
in
the
far
punjab
and
were
these
women
mere
dolls
these
men
mere
gladiators
were
they
not
the
parents
of
philosophy
science
poetry
the
plastic
arts
we
talk
of
education
now
are
we
more
educated
than
were
the
ancient
greeks
do
we
know
anything
about
education
physical
intellectual
or
aesthetic
and
i
may
say
moral
likewise
religious
education
of
course
in
our
sense
of
the
word
they
had
none
but
do
we
know
anything
about
education
of
which
they
have
not
taught
us
at
least
the
rudiments
are
there
not
some
branches
of
education
which
they
perfected
once
and
for
ever
leaving
us
northern
barbarians
to
follow
or
else
not
to
follow
their
example
to
produce
health
that
is
harmony
and
sympathy
proportion
and
grace
in
every
faculty
of
mind
and
body
that
was
their
notion
of
education
to
produce
that
the
of
their
childhood
was
the
poetry
of
homer
and
not
of
but
i
am
treading
on
dangerous
ground
it
was
for
this
that
the
seafaring
greek
lad
was
taught
to
find
his
ideal
in
ulysses
while
his
sister
at
home
found
hers
it
may
be
in
nausicaa
it
was
for
this
that
when
perhaps
the
most
complete
and
exquisite
of
all
the
greeks
sophocles
the
good
beloved
by
gods
and
men
represented
on
the
athenian
stage
his
drama
of
nausicaa
and
as
usual
could
not
for
he
had
no
voice
himself
take
a
speaking
part
he
was
content
to
do
one
thing
in
which
he
specially
excelled
and
dressed
and
masked
as
a
girl
to
play
at
ball
amid
the
chorus
of
nausicaa
maidens
that
drama
of
nausicaa
is
lost
and
if
i
dare
say
so
of
any
play
of
sophocles
i
scarce
regret
it
it
is
well
perhaps
that
we
have
no
second
conception
of
the
scene
to
interfere
with
the
simplicity
so
grand
and
yet
so
tender
of
homer
idyllic
episode
nausicaa
it
must
be
remembered
is
the
daughter
of
a
king
but
not
of
a
king
in
the
exclusive
modern
european
or
old
eastern
sense
her
father
alcinous
is
simply
primus
inter
pares
among
a
community
of
merchants
who
are
called
kings
likewise
and
mayor
for
life
so
to
speak
of
a
new
trading
city
a
nascent
genoa
or
venice
on
the
shore
of
the
mediterranean
but
the
girl
nausicaa
as
she
sleeps
in
her
carved
chamber
is
like
the
immortals
in
form
and
face
and
two
handmaidens
who
sleep
on
each
side
of
the
polished
door
have
beauty
from
the
graces
to
her
there
enters
in
the
shape
of
some
maiden
friend
none
less
than
pallas
athene
herself
intent
on
saving
worthily
her
favourite
the
shipwrecked
ulysses
and
bids
her
in
a
dream
go
forth
and
wash
the
clothes
nausicaa
wherefore
doth
thy
mother
bear
child
so
forgetful
this
long
time
doth
rest
like
lumber
in
the
house
much
raiment
fair
soon
must
thou
wed
and
be
thyself
and
find
thy
bridegroom
raiment
of
the
best
these
are
the
things
whence
good
repute
is
born
and
praises
that
make
glad
a
parent
breast
come
let
us
both
go
washing
with
the
morn
so
shalt
thou
have
clothes
becoming
to
be
worn
know
that
thy
maidenhood
is
not
for
long
whom
the
phoeacian
chiefs
already
woo
lords
of
the
land
whence
thou
thyself
art
sprung
soon
as
the
shining
dawn
comes
forth
anew
for
wain
and
mules
thy
noble
father
sue
which
to
the
place
of
washing
shall
convey
girdles
and
shawls
and
rugs
of
splendid
hue
this
for
thyself
were
better
than
essay
thither
to
walk
the
place
is
distant
a
long
way
startled
by
her
dream
nausicaa
awakes
and
goes
to
find
her
parents
one
by
the
hearth
sat
with
the
maids
around
and
on
the
skeins
of
yarn
spent
her
morning
toil
him
to
the
council
bound
called
by
the
honoured
kings
just
going
forth
she
found
and
calling
him
as
she
might
now
pappa
phile
dear
papa
asks
for
the
mule
waggon
but
it
is
her
father
and
her
five
brothers
clothes
she
fain
would
wash
ashamed
to
name
her
marriage
to
her
father
dear
but
he
understood
all
and
she
goes
forth
in
the
mule
waggon
with
the
clothes
after
her
mother
has
put
in
a
chest
of
all
kinds
of
delicate
food
and
meat
and
wine
in
a
goatskin
and
last
but
not
least
the
indispensable
cruse
of
oil
for
anointing
after
the
bath
to
which
both
jews
greeks
and
romans
owed
so
much
health
and
beauty
and
then
we
read
in
the
simple
verse
of
a
poet
too
refined
like
the
rest
of
his
race
to
see
anything
mean
or
ridiculous
in
that
which
was
not
ugly
and
unnatural
how
she
and
her
maids
got
into
the
polished
waggon
with
good
wheels
and
she
took
the
whip
and
the
studded
reins
and
beat
them
till
they
started
and
how
the
mules
rattled
away
and
pulled
against
each
other
till
when
they
came
to
the
fair
flowing
river
which
feeds
good
lavatories
all
the
year
fitted
to
cleanse
all
sullied
robes
soever
they
from
the
wain
the
mules
unharnessed
there
and
chased
them
free
to
crop
their
juicy
fare
by
the
swift
river
on
the
margin
green
then
to
the
waters
dashed
the
clothes
they
bare
and
in
the
trenches
stamped
them
clean
which
having
washed
and
cleansed
they
spread
before
the
sunbeams
on
the
beach
where
most
did
lie
thick
pebbles
by
the
washed
ashore
so
having
left
them
in
the
heat
to
dry
they
to
the
bath
went
down
and
rubbed
with
rich
oil
their
midday
meal
essay
couched
in
green
turf
the
river
rolling
nigh
then
throwing
off
their
veils
at
ball
they
play
while
the
nausicaa
leads
the
choral
lay
the
mere
beauty
of
this
scene
all
will
feel
who
have
the
sense
of
beauty
in
them
yet
it
is
not
on
that
aspect
which
i
wish
to
dwell
but
on
its
healthfulness
exercise
is
taken
in
measured
time
to
the
sound
of
song
as
a
duty
almost
as
well
as
an
amusement
for
this
game
of
ball
which
is
here
mentioned
for
the
first
time
in
human
literature
nearly
three
thousand
years
ago
was
held
by
the
greeks
and
by
the
romans
after
them
to
be
an
almost
necessary
part
of
a
liberal
education
principally
doubtless
from
the
development
which
it
produced
in
the
upper
half
of
the
body
not
merely
to
the
arms
but
to
the
chest
by
raising
and
expanding
the
ribs
and
to
all
the
muscles
of
the
torso
whether
perpendicular
or
oblique
the
elasticity
and
grace
which
it
was
believed
to
give
were
so
much
prized
that
a
room
for
and
a
teacher
of
the
art
were
integral
parts
of
every
gymnasium
and
the
athenians
went
so
far
as
to
bestow
on
one
famous
ballplayer
aristonicus
of
carystia
a
statue
and
the
rights
of
citizenship
the
rough
and
hardy
young
spartans
when
passing
from
boyhood
into
manhood
received
the
title
of
seemingly
from
the
game
which
it
was
then
their
special
duty
to
learn
in
the
case
of
nausicaa
and
her
maidens
the
game
would
just
bring
into
their
right
places
all
that
is
liable
to
be
contracted
and
weakened
in
women
so
many
of
whose
occupations
must
needs
be
sedentary
and
stooping
while
the
song
which
accompanied
the
game
at
once
filled
the
lungs
regularly
and
rhythmically
and
prevented
violent
motion
or
unseemly
attitude
we
the
civilised
need
physiologists
to
remind
us
of
these
simple
facts
and
even
then
do
not
act
on
them
those
old
greeks
had
found
them
out
for
themselves
and
moreover
acted
on
them
but
fair
nausicaa
must
have
been
some
will
say
surely
a
mere
child
of
nature
and
an
uncultivated
person
so
far
from
it
that
her
whole
demeanour
and
speech
show
culture
of
the
very
highest
sort
full
of
sweetness
and
light
intelligent
and
fearless
quick
to
perceive
the
bearings
of
her
strange
and
sudden
adventure
quick
to
perceive
the
character
of
ulysses
quick
to
answer
his
lofty
and
refined
pleading
by
words
as
lofty
and
refined
and
pious
withal
for
it
is
she
who
speaks
to
her
handmaids
the
once
so
famous
words
strangers
and
poor
men
all
are
sent
from
zeus
and
alms
though
small
are
sweet
clear
of
intellect
prompt
of
action
modest
of
demeanour
shrinking
from
the
slightest
breath
of
scandal
while
she
is
not
ashamed
when
ulysses
bathed
and
dressed
looks
himself
again
to
whisper
to
her
maidens
her
wish
that
the
gods
might
send
her
such
a
this
is
nausicaa
as
homer
draws
her
and
as
many
a
scholar
and
poet
since
homer
has
accepted
her
for
the
ideal
of
noble
maidenhood
i
ask
my
readers
to
study
for
themselves
her
interview
with
ulysses
in
worsley
translation
or
rather
in
the
grand
simplicity
of
the
original
greek
and
judge
whether
nausicaa
is
not
as
perfect
a
lady
as
the
poet
who
imagined
her
or
it
may
be
drew
her
from
life
must
have
been
a
perfect
gentleman
both
complete
in
those
manners
which
says
the
old
proverb
make
the
man
but
which
are
the
woman
herself
because
with
her
who
acts
more
by
emotion
than
by
calculation
manners
are
the
outward
and
visible
tokens
of
her
inward
and
spiritual
grace
or
disgrace
and
flow
instinctively
whether
good
or
bad
from
the
instincts
of
her
inner
nature
true
nausicaa
could
neither
read
nor
write
no
more
most
probably
could
the
author
of
the
odyssey
no
more
for
that
matter
could
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
though
they
were
plainly
both
in
mind
and
manners
most
men
reading
and
writing
of
course
have
now
become
necessaries
of
humanity
and
are
to
be
given
to
every
human
being
that
he
may
start
fair
in
the
race
of
life
but
i
am
not
aware
that
greek
women
improved
much
either
in
manners
morals
or
happiness
by
acquiring
them
in
after
centuries
a
wise
man
would
sooner
see
his
daughter
a
nausicaa
than
a
sappho
an
aspasia
a
cleopatra
or
even
an
hypatia
full
of
such
thoughts
i
went
through
london
streets
among
the
nausicaas
of
the
present
day
the
girls
of
the
period
the
daughters
and
hereafter
mothers
of
our
future
rulers
the
great
demos
or
commercial
middle
class
of
the
greatest
mercantile
city
in
the
world
and
noted
what
i
had
noted
with
fear
and
sorrow
many
a
day
for
many
a
year
a
type
and
an
increasing
type
of
young
women
who
certainly
had
not
had
the
advantages
educational
and
other
of
that
greek
nausicaa
of
old
of
course
in
such
a
city
as
london
to
which
the
best
of
everything
physical
and
other
gravitates
i
could
not
but
pass
now
and
then
beautiful
persons
who
made
me
proud
of
those
grandes
anglaises
aux
joues
rouges
whom
the
parisiennes
ridicule
and
envy
but
i
could
not
help
suspecting
that
their
looks
showed
them
to
be
either
or
born
of
country
parents
and
this
suspicion
was
strengthened
by
the
fact
that
when
compared
with
their
mothers
the
mother
physique
was
in
the
majority
of
cases
superior
to
the
daughters
painful
it
was
to
one
accustomed
to
the
ruddy
peasant
girl
stalwart
even
when
as
often
squat
and
plain
to
remark
the
exceedingly
small
size
of
the
average
young
woman
by
which
i
do
not
mean
mere
want
of
height
that
is
a
little
matter
but
want
of
breadth
likewise
a
general
want
of
those
large
frames
which
indicate
usually
a
power
of
keeping
strong
and
healthy
not
merely
the
muscles
but
the
brain
itself
poor
little
things
i
passed
hundreds
i
pass
hundreds
every
day
trying
to
hide
their
littleness
by
the
nasty
mass
of
false
hair
or
what
does
duty
for
it
and
by
the
ugly
and
useless
hat
which
is
stuck
upon
it
making
the
head
thereby
look
ridiculously
large
and
heavy
and
by
the
high
heels
on
which
they
totter
onward
having
forgotten
or
never
learnt
the
simple
art
of
walking
their
bodies
tilted
forward
in
that
ungraceful
attitude
which
is
called
why
that
name
of
all
others
a
grecian
bend
seemingly
kept
on
their
feet
and
kept
together
at
all
in
that
strange
attitude
by
tight
stays
which
prevented
all
graceful
and
healthy
motion
of
the
hips
or
sides
their
raiment
meanwhile
being
purposely
misshapen
in
this
direction
and
in
that
to
hide
it
must
be
presumed
deficiencies
of
form
if
that
chignon
and
those
heels
had
been
taken
off
the
figure
which
would
have
remained
would
have
been
that
too
often
of
a
puny
girl
of
sixteen
and
yet
there
was
no
doubt
that
these
women
were
not
only
full
grown
but
some
of
them
alas
wives
and
mothers
poor
little
and
this
they
have
gained
by
civilisation
the
power
of
aping
the
fashions
by
which
the
parisienne
hides
her
own
personal
defects
and
of
making
themselves
by
innate
want
of
that
taste
which
the
parisienne
possesses
only
the
cause
of
something
like
a
sneer
from
many
a
cultivated
man
and
of
something
like
a
sneer
too
from
yonder
gipsy
woman
who
passes
by
with
bold
bright
face
and
swinging
hip
and
footstep
stately
and
elastic
far
better
dressed
according
to
all
true
canons
of
taste
than
most
and
thanking
her
fate
that
she
and
her
rom
are
no
and
but
fatten
on
free
air
upon
the
open
moor
but
the
face
which
is
beneath
that
chignon
and
that
hat
well
it
is
sometimes
pretty
but
how
seldom
handsome
which
is
a
higher
quality
by
far
it
is
not
strange
to
say
a
face
plenty
of
money
and
perhaps
too
much
is
spent
on
those
fine
clothes
it
had
been
better
to
judge
from
the
complexion
if
some
of
that
money
had
been
spent
in
solid
wholesome
food
she
looks
as
if
she
lived
as
she
too
often
does
i
hear
on
tea
and
or
rather
on
bread
with
the
minimum
of
butter
for
as
the
want
of
bone
indicates
a
deficiency
of
phosphatic
food
so
does
the
want
of
flesh
about
the
cheeks
indicate
a
deficiency
of
hydrocarbon
poor
little
nausicaa
that
is
not
her
fault
our
boasted
civilisation
has
not
even
taught
her
what
to
eat
as
it
certainly
has
not
increased
her
appetite
and
she
knows
not
what
every
country
fellow
knows
that
without
plenty
of
butter
and
other
fatty
matters
she
is
not
likely
to
keep
even
warm
better
to
eat
nasty
fat
bacon
now
than
to
supply
the
want
of
it
some
few
years
hence
by
nastier
oil
but
there
is
no
one
yet
to
tell
her
that
and
a
dozen
other
equally
simple
facts
for
her
own
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
that
coming
demos
which
she
is
to
bring
into
the
world
a
demos
which
if
we
can
only
keep
it
healthy
in
body
and
brain
has
before
it
so
splendid
a
future
but
which
if
body
and
brain
degrade
beneath
the
influence
of
modern
barbarism
is
but
too
likely
to
follow
the
demos
of
ancient
byzantium
or
of
modern
paris
ay
but
her
intellect
she
is
so
clever
and
she
reads
so
much
and
she
is
going
to
be
taught
to
read
so
much
more
ah
well
there
was
once
a
science
called
physiognomy
the
greeks
from
what
i
can
learn
knew
more
of
it
than
any
people
since
though
the
italian
painters
and
sculptors
must
have
known
much
far
more
than
we
in
a
more
scientific
civilisation
there
will
be
such
a
science
once
more
but
its
laws
though
still
in
the
empiric
stage
are
not
altogether
forgotten
by
some
little
children
have
often
a
fine
and
clear
instinct
of
them
many
cultivated
and
experienced
women
have
a
fine
and
clear
instinct
of
them
likewise
and
some
such
would
tell
us
that
there
is
intellect
in
plenty
in
the
modern
nausicaa
but
not
of
the
quality
which
they
desire
for
their
country
future
good
eagerness
volubility
petulance
in
countenance
in
gesture
and
in
voice
which
last
is
too
often
most
harsh
and
artificial
the
breath
being
sent
forth
through
the
closed
teeth
and
almost
entirely
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
and
with
all
this
a
weariness
often
about
the
wrinkling
forehead
and
the
drooping
lids
all
these
which
are
growing
too
common
not
among
the
demos
only
nor
only
in
the
towns
are
signs
they
think
of
the
unrest
of
unhealth
physical
intellectual
spiritual
at
least
they
are
as
different
as
two
types
of
physiognomy
in
the
same
race
can
be
from
the
expression
both
of
face
and
gesture
in
those
old
greek
sculptures
and
in
the
old
italian
painters
and
it
must
be
said
in
the
portraits
of
reynolds
and
gainsborough
copley
and
romney
not
such
one
thinks
must
have
been
the
mothers
of
britain
during
the
latter
half
of
the
last
century
and
the
beginning
of
the
present
when
their
sons
at
times
were
holding
half
the
world
at
bay
and
if
nausicaa
has
become
such
in
town
what
is
she
when
she
goes
to
the
seaside
not
to
wash
the
clothes
in
but
herself
in
salt
the
very
laden
with
decaying
organisms
from
which
though
not
polluted
further
by
a
dozen
sewers
ulysses
had
to
cleanse
himself
anointing
too
with
oil
ere
he
was
fit
to
appear
in
the
company
of
nausicaa
of
greece
she
dirties
herself
with
the
dirty
and
probably
chills
and
tires
herself
by
walking
thither
and
back
and
staying
in
too
long
and
then
flaunts
on
the
pier
bedizened
in
garments
which
for
monstrosity
of
form
and
disharmony
of
colours
would
have
set
that
greek
nausicaa
teeth
on
edge
or
those
of
any
average
hindoo
woman
now
or
even
sadder
still
she
sits
on
chairs
and
benches
all
the
weary
afternoon
her
head
drooped
on
her
chest
over
some
novel
from
the
library
and
then
returns
to
tea
and
shrimps
and
lodgings
of
which
the
fragrance
is
not
unsuggestive
sometimes
not
unproductive
of
typhoid
fever
ah
poor
nausicaa
of
england
that
is
a
sad
sight
to
some
who
think
about
the
present
and
have
read
about
the
past
it
is
not
a
sad
sight
to
see
your
old
father
tradesman
or
clerk
or
what
not
who
has
done
good
work
in
his
day
and
hopes
to
do
some
more
sitting
by
your
old
mother
who
has
done
good
work
in
her
day
among
the
rest
that
heaviest
work
of
all
the
bringing
you
into
the
world
and
keeping
you
in
it
till
now
honest
kindly
cheerful
folk
enough
and
not
inefficient
in
their
own
calling
though
an
average
northumbrian
or
highlander
or
irish
easterling
beside
carrying
a
brain
of
five
times
the
intellectual
force
could
drive
five
such
men
over
the
cliff
with
his
bare
hands
it
is
not
a
sad
sight
i
say
to
see
them
sitting
about
upon
those
seaside
benches
looking
out
listlessly
at
the
water
and
the
ships
and
the
sunlight
and
enjoying
like
so
many
flies
upon
a
wall
the
novel
act
of
doing
nothing
it
is
not
the
old
for
whom
wise
men
are
sad
but
for
you
where
is
your
vitality
where
is
your
lebensgluckseligkeit
your
enjoyment
of
superfluous
life
and
power
why
can
you
not
even
dance
and
sing
till
now
and
then
at
night
perhaps
when
you
ought
to
be
safe
in
bed
but
when
the
weak
brain
after
receiving
the
day
nourishment
has
roused
itself
a
second
time
into
a
false
excitement
of
gaslight
pleasure
what
there
is
left
of
it
is
all
going
into
that
foolish
book
which
the
womanly
element
in
you
still
healthy
and
alive
delights
in
because
it
places
you
in
fancy
in
situations
in
which
you
will
never
stand
and
inspires
you
with
emotions
some
of
which
it
may
be
you
had
better
never
feel
poor
nausicaa
old
some
men
think
before
you
have
been
ever
young
and
now
they
are
going
to
develop
you
and
let
you
have
your
share
in
the
higher
education
of
women
by
making
you
read
more
books
and
do
more
sums
and
pass
examinations
and
stoop
over
desks
at
night
after
stooping
over
some
other
employment
all
day
and
to
teach
you
latin
and
even
greek
well
we
will
gladly
teach
you
greek
if
you
learn
thereby
to
read
the
history
of
nausicaa
of
old
and
what
manner
of
maiden
she
was
and
what
was
her
education
you
will
admire
her
doubtless
but
do
not
let
your
admiration
limit
itself
to
drawing
a
meagre
design
of
her
as
she
never
looked
copy
in
your
own
person
and
even
if
you
do
not
descend
as
low
or
rise
as
high
as
washing
the
household
clothes
at
least
learn
to
play
at
ball
and
sing
in
the
open
air
and
sunshine
not
in
theatres
and
by
gaslight
and
take
decent
care
of
your
own
health
and
dress
not
like
a
parisienne
nor
of
course
like
nausicaa
of
old
for
that
is
to
ask
too
much
but
somewhat
more
like
an
average
highland
lassie
and
try
to
look
like
her
and
be
like
her
of
whom
wordsworth
sang
a
mien
and
face
in
which
full
plainly
i
can
trace
benignity
and
sense
ripening
in
perfect
innocence
here
scattered
like
a
random
seed
remote
from
men
thou
dost
not
need
the
embarrassed
look
of
shy
distress
and
maidenly
shamefacedness
thou
upon
thy
forehead
clear
the
freedom
of
a
mountaineer
a
face
with
gladness
overspread
soft
smiles
by
human
kindness
bred
and
seemliness
complete
that
sways
thy
courtesies
about
thee
plays
with
no
restraint
save
such
as
springs
from
quick
and
eager
visitings
of
thoughts
that
lie
beyond
the
reach
of
thy
few
words
of
english
speech
a
bondage
sweetly
brooked
a
strife
that
gives
thy
gestures
grace
and
life
ah
yet
unspoilt
nausicaa
of
the
north
descendant
of
the
dark
hearted
celtic
girl
and
the
fair
scandinavian
viking
thank
god
for
thy
heather
and
fresh
air
and
the
kine
thou
tendest
and
the
wool
thou
spinnest
and
come
not
to
seek
thy
fortune
child
in
wicked
london
town
nor
import
as
they
tell
me
thou
art
doing
fast
the
ugly
fashions
of
that
london
town
clumsy
copies
of
parisian
cockneydom
into
thy
highland
home
nor
give
up
the
healthful
and
graceful
free
and
modest
dress
of
thy
mother
and
thy
mother
mother
to
disfigure
the
little
kirk
on
sabbath
days
with
crinoline
and
corset
boots
and
other
women
hair
it
is
proposed
just
now
to
assimilate
the
education
of
girls
more
and
more
to
that
of
boys
if
that
means
that
girls
are
merely
to
learn
more
lessons
and
to
study
what
their
brothers
are
taught
in
addition
to
what
their
mothers
were
taught
then
it
is
to
be
hoped
at
least
by
physiologists
and
patriots
that
the
scheme
will
sink
into
that
limbo
whither
in
a
free
and
tolerably
rational
country
all
imperfect
and
considered
schemes
are
sure
to
gravitate
but
if
the
proposal
be
a
bona
fide
one
then
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
in
the
public
schools
of
england
and
in
all
private
schools
i
presume
which
take
their
tone
from
them
cricket
and
football
are
more
or
less
compulsory
being
considered
integral
parts
of
an
englishman
education
and
that
they
are
likely
to
remain
so
in
spite
of
all
reclamations
because
masters
and
boys
alike
know
that
games
do
not
in
the
long
run
interfere
with
a
boy
work
that
the
same
boy
will
very
often
excel
in
both
that
the
games
keep
him
in
health
for
his
work
that
the
spirit
with
which
he
takes
to
his
games
when
in
the
lower
school
is
a
fair
test
of
the
spirit
with
which
he
will
take
to
his
work
when
he
rises
into
the
higher
school
and
that
nothing
is
worse
for
a
boy
than
to
fall
into
that
loafing
set
who
neither
play
hard
nor
work
hard
and
are
usually
extravagant
and
often
vicious
moreover
they
know
well
that
games
conduce
not
merely
to
physical
but
to
moral
health
that
in
the
field
boys
acquire
virtues
which
no
books
can
give
them
not
merely
daring
and
endurance
but
better
still
temper
fairness
honour
unenvious
approbation
of
another
success
and
all
that
give
and
take
of
life
which
stand
a
man
in
such
good
stead
when
he
goes
forth
into
the
world
and
without
which
indeed
his
success
is
always
maimed
and
partial
now
if
the
promoters
of
higher
education
for
women
will
compel
girls
to
any
training
analogous
to
our
public
school
games
if
for
instance
they
will
insist
on
that
most
natural
and
wholesome
of
all
exercises
dancing
in
order
to
develop
the
lower
half
of
the
body
on
singing
to
expand
the
lungs
and
regulate
the
breath
and
on
some
games
ball
or
what
not
which
will
ensure
that
raised
chest
and
upright
carriage
and
general
strength
of
the
upper
torso
without
which
full
oxygenation
of
the
blood
and
therefore
general
health
is
impossible
if
they
will
sternly
forbid
tight
stays
high
heels
and
all
which
interferes
with
free
growth
and
free
motion
if
they
will
consider
carefully
all
which
has
been
written
on
the
system
by
chadwick
and
others
and
accept
the
certain
physical
law
that
in
order
to
renovate
the
brain
day
by
day
the
growing
creature
must
have
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
play
and
that
the
child
who
learns
for
four
hours
and
plays
for
four
hours
will
learn
more
and
learn
it
more
easily
than
the
child
who
learns
for
the
whole
eight
hours
if
in
short
they
will
teach
girls
not
merely
to
understand
the
greek
tongue
but
to
copy
somewhat
of
the
greek
physical
training
of
that
music
and
gymnastic
which
helped
to
make
the
cleverest
race
of
the
old
world
the
ablest
race
likewise
then
they
will
earn
the
gratitude
of
the
patriot
and
the
physiologist
by
doing
their
best
to
stay
the
downward
tendencies
of
the
physique
and
therefore
ultimately
of
the
morale
in
the
coming
generation
of
english
women
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
as
yet
i
hear
of
but
one
movement
in
this
direction
among
the
promoters
of
the
higher
education
of
women
i
trust
that
the
subject
will
be
taken
up
methodically
by
those
gifted
ladies
who
have
acquainted
themselves
and
are
labouring
to
acquaint
other
women
with
the
first
principles
of
health
and
that
they
may
avail
to
prevent
the
coming
generations
under
the
unwholesome
stimulant
of
competitive
examinations
and
so
forth
from
developing
into
so
many
or
idiots
the
die
natur
ist
die
bewegung
who
are
these
who
follow
us
softly
over
the
moor
in
the
autumn
eve
their
wings
brush
and
rustle
in
the
and
they
whisper
before
us
and
behind
as
if
they
called
gently
to
each
other
like
birds
flocking
homeward
to
their
nests
the
woodpecker
on
the
knows
them
and
laughs
aloud
for
joy
as
they
pass
the
rooks
above
the
pasture
know
them
and
wheel
round
and
tumble
in
their
play
the
brown
leaves
on
the
oak
trees
know
them
and
flutter
faintly
and
beckon
as
they
pass
and
in
the
chattering
of
the
dry
leaves
there
is
a
meaning
and
a
cry
of
weary
things
which
long
for
rest
take
us
home
take
us
home
you
soft
now
our
fathers
the
sunbeams
are
grown
dull
our
green
summer
beauty
is
all
draggled
and
our
faces
are
grown
wan
and
wan
and
the
buds
the
children
whom
we
nourished
thrust
us
off
ungrateful
from
our
seats
waft
us
down
you
soft
upon
your
wings
to
the
quiet
earth
that
we
may
go
to
our
home
as
all
things
go
and
become
air
and
sunlight
once
again
and
the
bold
young
know
them
and
rattle
impatient
in
their
cones
blow
stronger
blow
fiercer
slow
and
shake
us
from
our
prisons
of
dead
wood
that
we
may
fly
and
spin
away
each
on
his
horny
wing
help
us
but
to
touch
the
moorland
yonder
and
we
will
take
good
care
of
ourselves
henceforth
we
will
dive
like
arrows
through
the
heather
and
drive
our
sharp
beaks
into
the
soil
and
rise
again
as
green
trees
toward
the
sunlight
and
spread
out
lusty
boughs
they
never
think
bold
fools
of
what
is
coming
to
bring
them
low
in
the
midst
of
their
pride
of
the
reckless
axe
which
will
fell
them
and
the
saw
which
will
shape
them
into
logs
and
the
trains
which
will
roar
and
rattle
over
them
as
they
lie
buried
in
the
gravel
of
the
way
till
they
are
ground
and
rotted
into
powder
and
dug
up
and
flung
upon
the
fire
that
they
too
may
return
home
like
all
things
and
become
air
and
sunlight
once
again
and
the
hear
their
prayers
and
do
their
bidding
but
faintly
for
they
themselves
are
tired
and
sad
tired
and
sad
are
the
and
their
garments
rent
and
wan
look
at
them
as
they
stream
over
the
black
forest
before
the
dim
sun
long
lines
and
wreaths
of
melancholy
grey
stained
with
dull
yellow
or
dead
dun
they
have
come
far
across
the
seas
and
done
many
a
wild
deed
upon
their
way
and
now
that
they
have
reached
the
land
like
shipwrecked
sailors
they
will
lie
down
and
weep
till
they
can
weep
no
more
ah
how
different
were
those
soft
when
invisible
to
mortal
eyes
they
started
on
their
long
five
thousand
miles
across
the
sea
out
of
the
blazing
caldron
which
lies
between
the
two
new
worlds
they
leapt
up
when
the
great
sun
called
them
in
whirls
and
spouts
of
clear
hot
steam
and
rushed
of
their
own
passion
to
the
northward
while
the
whirling
whirled
them
east
so
eastward
they
rushed
aloft
across
the
gay
west
indian
isles
leaving
below
the
glitter
of
the
and
the
sidelong
eyes
of
cruel
sharks
above
the
and
the
and
the
groves
which
fringe
the
shores
above
the
rocks
which
throbbed
with
earthquakes
and
the
peaks
of
old
volcanoes
while
far
beneath
the
ghosts
of
their
dead
sisters
hurried
home
upon
the
east
breeze
wild
deeds
they
did
as
they
rushed
onward
and
struggled
and
fought
among
themselves
up
and
down
and
round
and
backward
in
the
fury
of
their
blind
hot
youth
they
heeded
not
the
tree
as
they
snapped
it
nor
the
ship
as
they
whelmed
it
in
the
waves
nor
the
cry
of
the
sinking
sailor
nor
the
need
of
his
little
ones
on
shore
hasty
and
selfish
even
as
children
and
like
children
tamed
by
their
own
rage
for
they
tired
themselves
by
struggling
with
each
other
and
by
tearing
the
heavy
water
into
waves
and
their
wings
grew
clogged
with
and
soaked
more
and
more
with
steam
but
at
last
the
sea
grew
cold
beneath
them
and
their
clear
steam
shrank
to
mist
and
they
saw
themselves
and
each
other
wrapped
in
dull
clouds
they
then
drew
their
white
round
them
and
veiled
themselves
for
very
shame
and
said
we
have
been
wild
and
wayward
and
alas
our
pure
bright
youth
is
gone
but
we
will
do
one
good
deed
yet
ere
we
die
and
so
we
shall
not
have
lived
in
vain
we
will
glide
onward
to
the
land
and
weep
there
and
refresh
all
things
with
soft
warm
rain
and
make
the
grass
grow
the
buds
burst
quench
the
thirst
of
man
and
beast
and
wash
the
soiled
world
clean
so
they
are
wandering
past
us
the
to
weep
the
leaves
into
their
graves
to
weep
the
seeds
into
their
and
weep
the
soil
into
the
plains
to
get
the
rich
earth
ready
for
the
winter
and
then
creep
northward
to
the
and
there
die
weary
and
still
more
weary
slowly
and
more
slowly
still
they
will
journey
on
far
northward
across
seas
for
a
doom
is
laid
upon
them
never
to
be
still
again
till
they
rest
at
the
north
pole
itself
the
still
axle
of
the
spinning
world
and
sink
in
death
around
it
and
become
white
ghosts
but
will
they
live
again
those
chilled
yes
they
must
live
again
for
all
things
move
for
ever
and
not
even
ghosts
can
rest
so
the
corpses
of
their
sisters
piling
on
them
from
above
press
them
outward
press
them
southward
toward
the
sun
once
more
across
the
floes
and
round
the
icebergs
weeping
tears
of
snow
and
sleet
while
men
hate
their
wild
harsh
voices
and
shrink
before
their
bitter
breath
they
know
not
that
the
cold
bleak
as
they
hurtle
from
the
black
bear
back
the
ghosts
of
the
soft
as
penitents
to
their
father
the
great
sun
but
as
they
fly
southwards
warm
life
thrills
them
and
they
drop
their
loads
of
sleet
and
snow
and
meet
their
young
live
sisters
from
the
south
and
greet
them
with
flash
and
and
please
god
before
many
weeks
are
over
as
we
run
westward
ho
we
shall
overtake
the
ghosts
of
these
hurrying
back
toward
their
father
the
great
sun
fresh
and
bright
under
the
fresh
bright
heaven
they
will
race
with
us
toward
our
home
to
gain
new
heat
new
life
new
power
and
set
forth
about
their
work
once
more
men
call
them
the
wind
those
mothers
and
their
ghosts
the
trade
and
value
them
and
rightly
because
they
bear
the
traders
out
and
home
across
the
sea
but
wise
men
and
little
children
should
look
on
them
with
more
seeing
eyes
and
say
may
not
these
winds
be
living
creatures
they
too
are
thoughts
of
god
to
whom
all
live
for
is
not
our
life
like
their
life
do
we
not
come
and
go
as
they
out
of
god
boundless
bosom
the
fount
of
life
we
came
through
selfish
stormy
youth
and
contrite
tears
just
not
too
late
through
manhood
not
altogether
useless
through
slow
and
chill
old
age
we
return
from
whence
we
came
to
the
bosom
of
god
once
more
to
go
forth
again
it
may
be
with
fresh
knowledge
and
fresh
powers
to
nobler
work
amen
such
was
the
prophecy
which
i
learnt
or
seemed
to
learn
from
the
western
wind
off
the
atlantic
on
a
certain
delectable
evening
and
it
was
fulfilled
at
night
as
far
as
the
gentle
could
fulfil
it
for
foolish
man
there
was
a
roaring
in
the
woods
all
night
the
rain
came
heavily
and
fell
in
floods
but
now
the
sun
is
rising
calm
and
bright
the
birds
are
singing
in
the
distant
woods
over
his
own
sweet
voice
the
broods
the
jay
makes
answer
as
the
magpie
chatters
and
all
the
air
is
filled
with
pleasant
noise
of
waters
but
was
i
a
gloomy
and
distempered
man
if
upon
such
a
morn
as
that
i
stood
on
the
little
bridge
across
a
certain
brook
and
watched
the
water
run
with
something
of
a
sigh
or
if
when
the
schoolboy
beside
me
lamented
that
the
floods
would
surely
be
out
and
his
day
fishing
spoiled
i
said
to
him
ah
my
boy
that
is
a
little
matter
look
at
what
you
are
seeing
now
and
understand
what
barbarism
and
waste
mean
look
at
all
that
beautiful
water
which
god
has
sent
us
hither
off
the
atlantic
without
trouble
or
expense
to
us
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
gallons
will
run
under
this
bridge
and
what
shall
we
do
with
it
nothing
and
yet
think
only
of
the
mills
which
that
water
would
have
turned
think
how
it
might
have
kept
up
health
and
cleanliness
in
poor
creatures
packed
away
in
the
back
streets
of
the
nearest
town
or
even
in
london
itself
think
even
how
country
folk
in
many
parts
of
england
in
three
months
time
may
be
crying
out
for
rain
and
afraid
of
short
crops
and
fever
and
scarlatina
and
for
want
of
the
very
water
which
we
are
now
letting
run
back
wasted
into
the
sea
from
whence
it
came
and
yet
we
call
ourselves
a
civilised
people
it
is
not
wise
i
know
to
preach
to
boys
and
yet
sometimes
a
man
must
speak
his
heart
even
like
midas
slave
to
the
reeds
by
the
river
side
and
i
had
so
often
fishing
up
and
down
full
many
a
stream
whispered
my
story
to
those
same
and
told
them
that
my
lord
the
sovereign
demos
had
like
old
midas
asses
ears
in
spite
of
all
his
gold
that
i
thought
i
might
for
once
tell
it
the
boy
likewise
in
hope
that
he
might
help
his
generation
to
mend
that
which
my
own
generation
does
not
seem
like
to
mend
i
might
have
said
more
to
him
but
did
not
for
it
is
not
well
to
destroy
too
early
the
child
illusion
that
people
must
be
wise
because
they
are
grown
up
and
have
votes
and
rule
or
think
they
rule
the
world
the
child
will
find
out
how
true
that
is
soon
enough
for
himself
if
the
truth
be
forced
on
him
by
the
hot
words
of
those
with
whom
he
lives
it
is
apt
to
breed
in
him
that
contempt
stormful
and
therefore
barren
which
makes
revolutions
and
not
that
pity
calm
and
therefore
helpful
which
makes
reforms
so
i
might
have
said
to
him
but
did
not
and
then
men
pray
for
rain
my
boy
did
you
ever
hear
the
old
eastern
legend
about
the
gipsies
how
they
were
such
good
musicians
that
some
great
indian
sultan
sent
for
the
whole
tribe
and
planted
them
near
his
palace
and
gave
them
land
and
ploughs
to
break
it
up
and
seed
to
sow
it
that
they
might
dwell
there
and
play
and
sing
to
him
but
when
the
winter
arrived
the
gipsies
all
came
to
the
sultan
and
cried
that
they
were
starving
but
what
have
you
done
with
the
corn
which
i
gave
you
o
light
of
the
age
we
ate
it
in
the
summer
and
what
have
you
done
with
the
ploughs
which
i
gave
you
o
glory
of
the
universe
we
burnt
them
to
bake
the
corn
withal
then
said
that
great
sultan
like
the
butterflies
you
have
lived
and
like
the
butterflies
you
shall
wander
so
he
drove
them
out
and
that
is
how
the
gipsies
came
hither
from
the
east
now
suppose
that
the
sultan
of
all
sultans
who
sends
the
rain
should
make
a
like
answer
to
us
foolish
human
beings
when
we
prayed
for
rain
but
what
have
you
done
with
the
rain
which
i
gave
you
six
months
since
we
have
let
it
run
into
the
sea
then
ere
you
ask
for
more
rain
make
places
wherein
you
can
keep
it
when
you
have
it
but
that
would
be
in
most
cases
too
expensive
we
can
employ
our
capital
more
profitably
in
other
directions
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
what
answer
might
be
made
to
such
an
excuse
i
think
a
child
still
unsophisticated
sense
of
right
and
wrong
would
soon
supply
one
and
probably
one
considering
the
complexity
and
difficulty
and
novelty
of
the
whole
question
somewhat
too
harsh
as
judgments
are
wont
to
be
but
would
it
not
be
well
if
our
children
without
being
taught
to
blame
anyone
for
what
is
past
were
taught
something
about
what
ought
to
be
done
now
what
must
be
done
soon
with
the
rainfall
of
these
islands
and
about
other
and
kindred
on
the
solution
of
which
depends
and
will
depend
more
and
more
the
life
of
millions
one
would
have
thought
that
those
public
schools
and
colleges
which
desire
to
monopolise
the
education
of
the
owners
of
the
soil
of
the
great
employers
of
labour
of
the
clergy
and
of
all
indeed
who
ought
to
be
acquainted
with
the
duties
of
property
the
conditions
of
public
health
and
in
a
word
with
the
general
laws
of
what
is
now
called
social
science
one
would
have
thought
i
say
that
these
public
schools
and
colleges
would
have
taught
their
scholars
somewhat
at
least
about
such
matters
that
they
might
go
forth
into
life
with
at
least
some
rough
notions
of
the
causes
which
make
people
healthy
or
unhealthy
rich
or
poor
comfortable
or
wretched
useful
or
dangerous
to
the
state
but
as
long
as
our
great
educational
institutions
safe
or
fancying
themselves
safe
in
some
enchanted
castle
shut
out
by
ancient
magic
from
the
living
world
put
a
premium
on
latin
and
greek
verses
a
wise
father
will
during
the
holidays
talk
now
and
then
i
hope
somewhat
after
this
fashion
you
must
understand
my
boy
that
all
the
water
in
the
country
comes
out
of
the
sky
and
from
nowhere
else
and
that
therefore
to
save
and
store
the
water
when
it
falls
is
a
question
of
life
and
death
to
crops
and
man
and
beast
for
with
or
without
water
is
life
or
death
if
i
took
for
instance
the
water
from
the
moors
above
and
turned
it
over
yonder
field
i
could
double
and
more
than
double
the
crops
in
that
field
henceforth
then
why
do
i
not
do
it
only
because
the
field
lies
higher
than
the
house
and
if
now
here
is
one
thing
which
you
and
every
civilised
man
should
know
if
you
have
or
any
irrigated
land
as
it
is
called
above
a
house
or
even
on
a
level
with
it
it
is
certain
to
breed
not
merely
cold
and
damp
but
fever
or
ague
our
forefathers
did
not
understand
this
and
they
built
their
houses
as
this
is
built
in
the
lowest
places
they
could
find
sometimes
because
they
wished
to
be
near
ponds
from
whence
they
could
get
fish
in
lent
but
more
often
i
think
because
they
wanted
to
be
sheltered
from
the
wind
they
had
no
glass
as
we
have
in
their
windows
or
at
least
only
latticed
casements
which
let
in
the
wind
and
cold
and
they
shrank
from
high
and
exposed
and
therefore
really
healthy
spots
but
now
that
we
have
good
glass
and
sash
windows
and
doors
that
will
shut
tight
we
can
build
warm
houses
where
we
like
and
if
you
ever
have
to
do
with
the
building
of
cottages
remember
that
it
is
your
duty
to
the
people
who
will
live
in
them
and
therefore
to
the
state
to
see
that
they
stand
high
and
dry
where
no
water
can
drain
down
into
their
foundations
and
where
fog
and
the
poisonous
gases
which
are
given
out
by
rotting
vegetables
can
not
drain
down
either
you
will
learn
more
about
all
that
when
you
learn
as
every
civilised
lad
should
in
these
days
something
about
chemistry
and
the
laws
of
fluids
and
gases
but
you
know
already
that
flowers
are
cut
off
by
frost
in
the
low
grounds
sooner
than
in
the
high
and
that
the
fog
at
night
always
lies
along
the
brooks
and
that
the
sour
which
warns
us
to
shut
our
windows
at
sunset
comes
down
from
the
hill
and
not
up
from
the
valley
now
all
these
things
are
caused
by
one
and
the
same
law
that
cold
air
is
heavier
than
warm
and
therefore
like
so
much
water
must
run
down
hill
but
what
about
the
rainfall
well
i
have
wandered
a
little
from
the
rainfall
though
not
as
far
as
you
fancy
for
fever
and
ague
and
rheumatism
usually
mean
rain
in
the
wrong
place
but
if
you
knew
how
much
illness
and
torturing
pain
and
death
and
sorrow
arise
even
to
this
very
day
from
ignorance
of
these
simple
laws
then
you
would
bear
them
carefully
in
mind
and
wish
to
know
more
about
them
but
now
for
water
being
life
to
the
beasts
do
you
remember
though
you
are
hardly
old
enough
the
how
the
beasts
died
or
had
to
be
killed
and
buried
by
tens
of
thousands
and
how
misery
and
ruin
fell
on
hundreds
of
honest
men
and
women
over
many
of
the
richest
counties
of
england
but
how
we
in
this
vale
had
no
plague
and
how
there
was
none
as
far
as
i
recollect
in
the
uplands
of
devon
and
cornwall
nor
of
wales
nor
of
the
scotch
highlands
now
do
you
know
why
that
was
simply
because
we
here
like
those
other
uplanders
are
in
such
a
country
as
palestine
was
before
the
foolish
jews
cut
down
all
their
timber
and
so
destroyed
their
own
rainfall
a
land
of
brooks
of
water
of
fountains
and
depths
that
spring
out
of
valleys
and
hills
there
is
hardly
a
field
here
that
has
not
thank
god
its
running
brook
or
its
sweet
spring
from
which
our
cattle
were
drinking
their
health
and
life
while
in
the
of
cheshire
and
in
the
cambridgeshire
fens
which
were
drained
utterly
dry
the
poor
things
drank
no
water
too
often
save
that
of
the
very
same
putrid
ponds
in
which
they
had
been
standing
all
day
long
to
cool
themselves
and
to
keep
off
the
flies
i
do
not
say
of
course
that
bad
water
caused
the
it
came
by
infection
from
the
east
of
europe
but
i
say
that
bad
water
made
the
cattle
ready
to
take
it
and
made
it
spread
over
the
country
and
when
you
are
old
enough
i
will
give
you
plenty
of
proof
some
from
the
herds
of
your
own
kinsmen
that
what
i
say
is
true
and
as
for
pure
water
being
life
to
human
beings
why
have
we
never
fever
here
and
scarcely
ever
diseases
like
fever
zymotics
as
the
doctors
call
them
or
if
a
case
comes
into
our
parish
from
outside
why
does
the
fever
never
spread
for
the
very
same
reason
that
we
had
no
plague
because
we
have
more
pure
water
close
to
every
cottage
than
we
need
and
this
i
tell
you
that
the
only
two
outbreaks
of
deadly
disease
which
we
have
had
here
for
thirty
years
were
both
of
them
as
far
as
i
could
see
to
be
traced
to
filthy
water
having
got
into
the
poor
wells
water
you
must
remember
just
as
it
is
life
when
pure
is
death
when
foul
for
it
can
carry
unseen
to
the
eye
and
even
when
it
looks
clear
and
sparkling
and
tastes
soft
and
sweet
poisons
which
have
perhaps
killed
more
human
beings
than
ever
were
killed
in
battle
you
have
read
perhaps
how
the
athenians
when
they
were
dying
of
the
plague
accused
the
lacedaemonians
outside
the
walls
of
poisoning
their
wells
or
how
in
some
of
the
pestilences
of
the
middle
ages
the
common
people
used
to
accuse
the
poor
harmless
jews
of
poisoning
the
wells
and
set
upon
them
and
murdered
them
horribly
they
were
right
i
do
not
doubt
in
their
notion
that
the
was
giving
them
the
pestilence
but
they
had
not
sense
to
see
that
they
were
poisoning
the
wells
themselves
by
their
dirt
and
carelessness
or
in
the
case
of
poor
besieged
athens
probably
by
mere
overcrowding
which
has
cost
many
a
life
ere
now
and
will
cost
more
and
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
my
little
man
that
even
now
too
many
people
have
no
more
sense
than
they
had
and
die
in
consequence
if
you
could
see
a
and
men
shot
down
writhing
and
dying
in
hundreds
by
shell
and
bullet
would
not
that
seem
to
you
a
horrid
sight
then
i
do
not
wish
to
make
you
sad
too
early
but
this
is
a
fact
which
everyone
should
know
that
more
people
and
not
strong
men
only
but
women
and
little
children
too
are
killed
and
wounded
in
great
britain
every
year
by
bad
water
and
want
of
water
together
than
were
killed
and
wounded
in
any
battle
which
has
been
fought
since
you
were
born
medical
men
know
this
well
and
when
you
are
older
you
may
see
it
for
yourself
in
the
reports
pamphlets
and
so
on
without
end
but
why
do
not
people
stop
such
a
horrible
loss
of
life
well
my
dear
boy
the
true
causes
of
it
have
only
been
known
for
the
last
thirty
or
forty
years
and
we
english
are
as
good
king
alfred
found
us
to
his
sorrow
a
thousand
years
ago
very
slow
to
move
even
when
we
see
a
thing
ought
to
be
done
let
us
hope
that
in
this
matter
we
have
been
so
in
most
matters
as
yet
we
shall
be
like
the
tortoise
in
the
fable
and
not
the
hare
and
by
moving
slowly
but
surely
win
the
race
at
last
but
now
think
for
yourself
and
see
what
you
would
do
to
save
these
people
from
being
poisoned
by
bad
water
remember
that
the
plain
question
is
this
the
rainwater
comes
down
from
heaven
as
water
and
nothing
but
water
rainwater
is
the
only
pure
water
after
all
how
would
you
save
that
for
the
poor
people
who
have
none
there
run
away
and
hunt
rabbits
on
the
moor
but
look
meanwhile
how
you
would
save
some
of
this
beautiful
and
precious
water
which
is
roaring
away
into
the
sea
well
what
would
you
do
make
ponds
you
say
like
the
old
ponds
now
all
broken
down
dam
all
the
glens
across
their
mouths
and
turn
them
into
reservoirs
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
sucklings
well
that
will
have
to
be
done
that
is
being
done
more
and
more
more
or
less
well
the
good
people
of
glasgow
did
it
first
i
think
and
now
the
good
people
of
manchester
and
of
other
northern
towns
have
done
it
and
have
saved
many
a
human
life
thereby
already
but
it
must
be
done
some
day
all
over
england
and
wales
and
great
part
of
scotland
for
the
mountain
tops
and
moors
my
boy
by
a
beautiful
law
of
nature
compensate
for
their
own
poverty
by
yielding
a
wealth
which
the
rich
lowlands
can
not
yield
you
do
not
understand
then
see
yon
moor
above
can
grow
neither
corn
nor
grass
but
one
thing
it
can
grow
and
does
grow
without
which
we
should
have
no
corn
nor
grass
and
that
is
water
not
only
does
far
more
rain
fall
up
there
than
falls
here
down
below
but
even
in
drought
the
high
moors
condense
the
moisture
into
dew
and
so
yield
some
water
even
when
the
lowlands
are
burnt
up
with
drought
the
reason
of
that
you
must
learn
hereafter
that
it
is
so
you
should
know
yourself
for
on
the
high
chalk
downs
you
know
where
farmers
make
a
they
never
if
they
are
wise
make
it
in
a
valley
or
on
a
but
on
the
bleakest
top
of
the
very
highest
down
and
there
if
they
can
once
get
it
filled
with
snow
and
rain
in
winter
the
blessed
dews
of
night
will
keep
some
water
in
it
all
the
summer
through
while
the
ponds
below
are
utterly
dried
up
and
even
so
it
is
as
i
know
with
this
very
moor
corn
and
grass
it
will
not
grow
because
there
is
too
little
staple
that
is
soluble
minerals
in
the
sandy
soil
but
how
much
water
it
might
grow
you
may
judge
roughly
for
yourself
by
remembering
how
many
brooks
like
this
are
running
off
it
now
to
carry
mere
dirt
into
the
river
and
then
into
the
sea
but
why
should
we
not
make
dams
at
once
and
save
the
water
because
we
can
not
afford
it
no
one
would
buy
the
water
when
we
had
stored
it
the
rich
in
town
and
country
will
always
take
care
and
quite
right
they
are
to
have
water
enough
for
themselves
and
for
their
servants
too
whatever
it
may
cost
them
but
the
poorer
people
are
and
therefore
usually
alas
the
more
ignorant
the
less
water
they
get
and
the
less
they
care
to
have
water
and
the
less
they
are
inclined
to
pay
for
it
and
the
more
i
am
sorry
to
say
they
waste
what
little
they
do
get
and
i
am
still
more
sorry
to
say
spoil
and
even
steal
and
sell
in
london
at
least
the
and
which
bring
the
water
into
their
houses
so
that
keeping
a
is
a
very
troublesome
and
uncertain
business
and
one
which
is
not
likely
to
pay
us
or
any
one
round
here
but
why
not
let
some
company
manage
it
as
they
manage
railways
and
gas
and
other
things
ah
you
have
been
overhearing
a
good
deal
about
companies
of
late
i
see
but
this
i
will
tell
you
that
when
you
grow
up
and
have
a
vote
and
influence
it
will
be
your
duty
if
you
intend
to
be
a
good
citizen
not
only
not
to
put
the
of
england
into
the
hands
of
fresh
companies
but
to
help
to
take
out
of
their
hands
what
they
manage
already
especially
in
london
and
likewise
the
and
the
railroads
and
everything
else
in
a
word
which
everybody
uses
and
must
use
for
you
must
understand
at
least
as
soon
as
you
can
that
though
the
men
who
make
up
companies
are
no
worse
than
other
men
and
some
of
them
as
you
ought
to
know
very
good
men
yet
what
they
have
to
look
to
is
their
profits
and
the
less
water
they
supply
and
the
worse
it
is
the
more
profit
they
make
for
most
water
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
fouled
before
the
water
companies
can
get
to
it
as
this
water
which
runs
past
us
will
be
and
as
the
thames
water
above
london
is
therefore
it
has
to
be
cleansed
or
partly
cleansed
at
a
very
great
expense
so
water
companies
have
to
be
inspected
in
plain
english
watched
at
a
very
heavy
expense
to
the
nation
by
government
officers
and
compelled
to
do
their
best
and
take
their
utmost
care
and
so
it
has
come
to
pass
that
the
london
water
is
not
now
nearly
as
bad
as
some
of
it
was
thirty
years
ago
when
it
was
no
more
fit
to
drink
than
that
in
the
cattle
yard
tank
but
still
we
must
have
more
water
and
better
in
london
for
it
is
growing
year
by
year
there
are
more
than
three
millions
of
people
already
in
what
we
call
london
and
ere
you
are
an
old
man
there
may
be
between
four
and
five
millions
now
to
supply
all
these
people
with
water
is
a
duty
which
we
must
not
leave
to
any
private
companies
it
must
be
done
by
a
public
authority
as
is
fit
and
proper
in
a
free
governing
country
in
this
matter
as
in
all
others
we
will
try
to
do
what
the
royal
commission
told
us
four
years
ago
we
ought
to
do
i
hope
that
you
will
see
though
i
may
not
the
day
when
what
we
call
london
but
which
is
really
of
it
only
a
great
nest
of
separate
villages
huddled
together
will
be
divided
into
three
great
cities
london
westminster
and
southwark
each
with
its
own
corporation
like
that
of
the
venerable
and
city
of
london
each
managing
its
own
and
sewage
and
other
matters
besides
and
managing
them
like
dublin
glasgow
manchester
liverpool
and
other
great
northern
towns
far
more
cheaply
and
far
better
than
any
companies
can
do
it
for
them
but
where
shall
we
get
water
enough
for
all
these
millions
of
people
there
are
no
mountains
near
london
but
we
might
give
them
the
water
off
our
moors
no
no
my
boy
he
that
will
not
when
he
may
when
he
will
he
shall
have
nay
some
fifteen
years
ago
the
londoners
might
have
had
water
from
us
and
i
was
one
of
those
who
did
my
best
to
get
it
for
them
but
the
water
companies
did
not
choose
to
take
it
and
now
this
part
of
england
is
growing
so
populous
and
so
valuable
that
it
wants
all
its
little
rainfall
for
itself
so
there
is
another
leaf
torn
out
of
the
sibylline
books
for
the
poor
old
water
companies
you
do
not
understand
you
will
some
day
but
you
may
comfort
yourself
about
london
for
it
happens
to
be
i
think
the
luckiest
city
in
the
world
and
if
it
had
not
been
we
should
have
had
pestilence
on
pestilence
in
it
as
terrible
as
the
great
plague
of
charles
ii
time
the
old
britons
without
knowing
in
the
least
what
they
were
doing
settled
old
london
city
in
the
very
centre
of
the
most
wonderful
natural
reservoir
in
this
island
or
perhaps
in
all
europe
which
reaches
from
kent
into
wiltshire
and
round
again
into
suffolk
and
that
is
the
dear
old
chalk
downs
why
they
are
always
dry
yes
but
the
turf
on
them
never
burns
up
and
the
streams
which
flow
through
them
never
run
dry
and
seldom
or
never
flood
either
do
you
not
know
from
winchester
that
that
is
true
then
where
is
all
the
rain
and
snow
gone
which
falls
on
them
year
by
year
but
into
the
chalk
itself
and
into
the
greensands
too
below
the
chalk
there
it
is
soaked
up
as
by
a
sponge
in
quantity
incalculable
enough
some
think
to
supply
london
let
it
grow
as
huge
as
it
may
i
wish
i
too
were
sure
of
that
but
the
commission
has
shown
itself
so
wise
and
fair
and
brave
likewise
too
brave
i
am
sorry
to
say
for
some
who
might
have
supported
them
that
it
is
not
for
me
to
gainsay
their
opinion
but
if
there
was
not
water
enough
in
the
chalk
are
not
the
londoners
rich
enough
to
bring
it
from
any
distance
my
boy
in
this
also
we
will
agree
with
the
commission
that
we
ought
not
to
rob
peter
to
pay
paul
and
take
water
to
a
distance
which
other
people
close
at
hand
may
want
look
at
the
map
of
england
and
southern
scotland
and
see
for
yourself
what
is
just
according
to
geography
and
nature
there
are
four
four
great
first
the
hills
of
the
border
their
rainfall
ought
to
be
stored
for
the
lothians
and
the
extreme
north
of
england
then
the
yorkshire
and
derbyshire
hills
the
central
chine
of
england
their
rainfall
is
being
stored
already
to
the
honour
of
the
shrewd
northern
men
for
the
manufacturing
counties
east
and
west
of
the
hills
then
come
the
lake
mountains
the
finest
of
all
because
more
rain
by
far
falls
there
than
in
any
place
in
england
but
they
will
be
wanted
to
supply
lancashire
and
some
day
liverpool
itself
for
liverpool
is
now
using
rain
which
belongs
more
justly
to
other
towns
and
besides
there
are
plenty
of
counties
and
towns
down
into
cheshire
which
would
be
glad
of
what
water
lancashire
does
not
want
and
last
come
the
snowdon
mountains
a
noble
which
i
know
well
for
an
old
dream
of
mine
has
been
that
ere
i
died
i
should
see
all
the
rain
of
the
carnedds
and
the
glyders
and
siabod
and
snowdon
itself
carried
across
the
conway
river
to
feed
the
mining
districts
of
north
wales
where
the
streams
are
now
all
foul
with
oil
and
lead
and
then
on
into
the
western
coal
and
iron
fields
to
wolverhampton
and
birmingham
itself
and
if
i
were
the
engineer
who
got
that
done
i
should
be
happier
prouder
i
dare
not
say
than
if
i
had
painted
nobler
pictures
than
raffaelle
or
written
nobler
plays
than
shakespeare
i
say
that
boy
in
most
deliberate
earnest
but
meanwhile
do
you
not
see
that
in
districts
where
coal
and
iron
may
be
found
and
fresh
manufactures
may
spring
up
any
day
in
any
place
each
district
has
a
right
to
claim
the
nearest
rainfall
for
itself
and
now
when
we
have
got
the
water
into
its
proper
place
let
us
see
what
we
shall
do
with
it
but
why
do
you
say
we
can
you
and
i
do
all
this
my
boy
are
not
you
and
i
free
citizens
part
of
the
people
the
commons
as
the
good
old
word
runs
of
this
country
and
are
we
not
or
ought
we
not
to
be
in
time
beside
that
educated
men
by
the
people
remember
i
mean
not
only
the
man
who
has
just
got
a
vote
i
mean
the
clergy
of
all
denominations
and
the
gentlemen
of
the
press
and
last
but
not
least
the
scientific
men
if
those
four
classes
together
were
to
tell
every
government
free
water
we
will
have
and
as
much
as
we
reasonably
choose
and
tell
every
candidate
for
the
house
of
commons
unless
you
promise
to
get
us
as
much
free
water
as
we
reasonably
choose
we
will
not
return
you
to
parliament
then
i
think
we
four
should
put
such
a
pressure
on
government
as
no
water
companies
or
other
vested
interests
could
long
resist
and
if
any
of
those
four
classes
should
hang
back
and
waste
their
time
and
influence
over
matters
far
less
important
and
less
pressing
the
other
three
must
laugh
at
them
and
more
than
laugh
at
them
and
ask
them
why
have
you
education
why
have
you
influence
why
have
you
votes
why
are
you
freemen
and
not
slaves
if
not
to
preserve
the
comfort
the
decency
the
health
the
lives
of
men
women
and
children
most
of
those
latter
your
own
wives
and
your
own
children
but
what
shall
we
do
with
the
water
well
after
all
that
is
a
more
practical
matter
than
speculations
grounded
on
the
supposition
that
all
classes
will
do
their
duty
but
the
first
thing
we
will
do
will
be
to
give
to
the
very
poorest
houses
a
constant
supply
at
high
pressure
so
that
everybody
may
take
as
much
water
as
he
likes
instead
of
having
to
keep
the
water
in
little
cisterns
where
it
gets
foul
and
putrid
only
too
often
but
will
they
not
waste
it
then
so
far
from
it
wherever
the
water
has
been
laid
on
at
high
pressure
the
waste
which
is
terrible
now
some
say
that
in
london
of
the
water
is
wasted
begins
to
lessen
and
both
water
and
expense
are
saved
if
you
will
only
think
you
will
see
one
reason
why
if
a
woman
leaves
a
tap
running
she
will
flood
her
place
and
her
too
she
will
be
like
the
magician
servant
who
called
up
the
demon
to
draw
water
for
him
and
so
he
did
but
when
he
had
begun
he
would
not
stop
and
if
the
magician
had
not
come
home
man
and
house
would
have
been
washed
away
but
if
it
saves
money
why
do
not
the
water
companies
do
it
because
and
really
here
there
are
many
excuses
for
the
poor
old
water
companies
when
so
many
of
them
swerve
and
gib
at
the
very
mention
of
constant
like
a
poor
horse
set
to
draw
a
load
which
he
feels
is
too
heavy
for
him
because
to
keep
everything
in
order
among
dirty
careless
and
often
drunken
people
there
must
be
officers
with
lawful
authority
we
will
call
them
who
can
enter
people
houses
when
they
will
and
if
they
find
anything
wrong
with
the
water
set
it
to
rights
with
a
high
hand
and
even
summon
the
people
who
have
set
it
wrong
and
that
is
a
power
which
in
a
free
country
must
never
be
given
to
the
servants
of
any
private
company
but
only
to
the
officers
of
a
corporation
or
of
the
government
and
what
shall
we
do
with
the
rest
of
the
water
well
we
shall
have
i
believe
so
much
to
spare
that
we
may
at
least
do
this
in
each
district
of
each
city
and
the
centre
of
each
town
we
may
build
public
baths
and
lavatories
where
poor
men
and
women
may
get
their
warm
baths
when
they
will
for
now
they
usually
never
bathe
at
all
because
they
will
not
and
ought
not
if
they
be
folk
bathe
in
cold
water
during
nine
months
of
the
year
and
there
they
shall
wash
their
clothes
and
dry
them
by
steam
instead
of
washing
them
as
now
at
home
either
under
back
sheds
where
they
catch
cold
and
rheumatism
or
too
often
alas
in
their
own
living
rooms
in
an
atmosphere
of
foul
vapour
which
drives
the
father
to
the
and
the
children
into
the
streets
and
which
not
only
prevents
the
clothes
from
being
thoroughly
dried
again
but
is
my
dear
boy
as
you
will
know
when
you
are
older
a
very
of
disease
and
they
shall
have
other
comforts
and
even
luxuries
these
public
lavatories
and
be
made
in
time
graceful
and
refining
as
well
as
merely
useful
nay
we
will
even
i
think
have
in
front
of
each
of
them
a
real
fountain
not
like
the
though
they
are
great
and
needful
boons
which
you
see
here
and
there
about
the
streets
with
a
tiny
dribble
of
water
to
a
great
deal
of
expensive
stone
but
real
fountains
which
shall
leap
and
sparkle
and
plash
and
gurgle
and
fill
the
place
with
life
and
light
and
coolness
and
sing
in
the
people
ears
the
sweetest
of
all
earthly
songs
save
the
song
of
a
mother
over
her
child
the
song
of
the
laughing
water
but
will
not
that
be
a
waste
yes
my
boy
and
for
that
very
reason
i
think
we
the
people
will
have
our
fountains
if
it
be
but
to
make
our
governments
and
corporations
and
all
public
bodies
and
officers
remember
that
they
all
save
her
majesty
the
queen
are
our
servants
and
not
we
theirs
and
that
we
choose
to
have
water
not
only
to
wash
with
but
to
play
with
if
we
like
and
i
believe
for
the
world
as
you
will
find
is
full
not
only
of
just
but
of
generous
souls
that
if
the
were
set
really
right
there
would
be
found
in
many
a
city
many
a
generous
man
who
over
and
above
his
compulsory
would
give
his
poor
such
a
real
fountain
as
those
which
ennoble
the
great
square
at
carcasonne
and
the
great
square
at
nismes
to
be
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
for
ever
and
now
if
you
want
to
go
back
to
your
latin
and
greek
you
shall
translate
for
me
into
latin
i
do
not
expect
you
to
do
it
into
greek
though
it
would
turn
very
well
into
greek
for
the
greeks
knew
all
about
the
matter
long
before
the
romans
what
follows
here
and
you
shall
verify
the
facts
and
the
names
in
it
from
your
dictionaries
of
antiquity
and
biography
that
you
may
remember
all
the
better
what
it
says
and
by
that
time
i
think
you
will
have
learnt
something
more
useful
to
yourself
and
i
hope
to
your
country
hereafter
than
if
you
had
learnt
to
patch
together
the
neatest
greek
and
latin
verses
which
have
appeared
since
the
days
of
canning
i
have
often
amused
myself
by
fancying
one
question
which
an
old
roman
emperor
would
ask
were
he
to
rise
from
his
grave
and
visit
the
sights
of
london
under
the
guidance
of
some
minister
of
state
the
august
shade
would
doubtless
admire
our
railroads
and
bridges
our
cathedrals
and
our
public
parks
and
much
more
of
which
we
need
not
be
ashamed
but
after
a
while
i
think
he
would
look
round
whether
in
london
or
in
most
of
our
great
cities
inquiringly
and
in
vain
for
one
class
of
buildings
which
in
his
empire
were
wont
to
be
almost
as
conspicuous
and
as
splendid
because
in
public
opinion
almost
as
necessary
as
the
basilicas
and
temples
and
where
he
would
ask
are
your
public
baths
and
if
the
minister
of
state
who
was
his
guide
should
answer
o
great
caesar
i
really
do
not
know
i
believe
there
are
some
somewhere
at
the
back
of
that
ugly
building
which
we
call
the
national
gallery
and
i
think
there
have
been
some
meetings
lately
in
the
east
end
and
an
amateur
concert
at
the
albert
hall
for
restoring
by
private
subscriptions
some
baths
and
in
bethnal
green
which
had
fallen
to
decay
and
there
may
be
two
or
three
more
about
the
metropolis
for
parish
vestries
have
powers
by
act
of
parliament
to
establish
such
places
if
they
think
fit
and
choose
to
pay
for
them
out
of
the
rates
then
i
think
the
august
shade
might
well
make
answer
we
used
to
call
you
in
old
rome
northern
barbarians
it
seems
that
you
have
not
lost
all
your
barbarian
habits
are
you
aware
that
in
every
city
in
the
roman
empire
there
were
as
a
matter
of
course
public
baths
open
not
only
to
the
poorest
freeman
but
to
the
slave
usually
for
the
payment
of
the
smallest
current
coin
and
often
gratuitously
are
you
aware
that
in
rome
itself
millionaire
after
millionaire
emperor
after
emperor
from
menenius
agrippa
and
nero
down
to
diocletian
and
constantine
built
baths
and
yet
more
baths
and
connected
with
them
gymnasia
for
exercise
libraries
and
porticos
wherein
the
people
might
have
shade
and
shelter
and
rest
i
remark
that
i
have
not
seen
in
all
your
london
a
single
covered
place
in
which
the
people
may
take
shelter
during
a
shower
are
you
aware
that
these
baths
were
of
the
most
magnificent
architecture
decorated
with
marbles
paintings
sculptures
fountains
what
not
and
yet
i
had
heard
in
hades
down
below
that
you
prided
yourselves
here
on
the
study
of
the
learned
languages
and
indeed
taught
little
but
greek
and
latin
at
your
public
schools
then
if
the
minister
should
make
reply
oh
yes
we
know
all
this
even
since
the
revival
of
letters
in
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
a
whole
literature
has
been
written
a
great
deal
of
it
i
fear
by
pedants
who
seldom
washed
even
their
hands
and
faces
about
your
greek
and
roman
baths
we
visit
their
colossal
ruins
in
italy
and
elsewhere
with
awe
and
admiration
and
the
discovery
of
a
new
roman
bath
in
any
old
city
of
our
isles
sets
all
our
antiquaries
buzzing
with
interest
then
why
the
shade
might
ask
do
you
not
copy
an
example
which
you
so
much
admire
surely
england
must
be
much
in
want
either
of
water
or
of
fuel
to
heat
it
with
on
the
contrary
our
rainfall
is
almost
too
great
our
soil
so
damp
that
we
have
had
to
invent
a
whole
art
of
subsoil
drainage
unknown
to
you
while
as
for
fuel
our
make
us
the
great
people
of
the
world
what
a
quiet
sneer
might
curl
the
lip
of
a
constantine
as
he
replied
not
in
vain
as
i
said
did
we
call
you
some
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
the
barbarians
of
the
north
but
tell
me
good
barbarian
whom
i
know
to
be
both
brave
and
wise
for
the
fame
of
your
young
british
empire
has
reached
us
even
in
the
realms
below
and
we
recognise
in
you
with
all
respect
a
people
more
like
us
romans
than
any
which
has
appeared
on
earth
for
many
centuries
how
is
it
you
have
forgotten
that
sacred
duty
of
keeping
the
people
clean
which
you
surely
at
one
time
learnt
from
us
when
your
ancestors
entered
our
armies
and
rose
some
of
them
to
be
great
generals
and
even
emperors
like
those
two
teuton
peasants
justin
and
justinian
who
long
after
my
days
reigned
in
my
own
constantinople
then
at
least
you
saw
baths
and
used
them
and
felt
after
the
bath
that
you
were
civilised
men
and
not
ac
foetentes
as
we
used
to
call
you
when
fresh
out
of
your
and
how
is
it
that
you
have
forgotten
that
lesson
the
minister
i
fear
would
have
to
answer
that
our
ancestors
were
barbarous
enough
not
only
to
destroy
the
roman
cities
and
temples
and
basilicas
and
statues
but
the
roman
baths
likewise
and
then
retired
each
man
to
his
own
freehold
in
the
country
to
live
a
life
not
much
more
cleanly
or
more
graceful
than
that
of
the
swine
which
were
his
favourite
food
but
he
would
have
a
right
to
plead
as
an
excuse
that
not
only
in
england
but
throughout
the
whole
of
the
conquered
latin
empire
the
latin
priesthood
who
in
some
respects
were
to
their
honour
the
representatives
of
roman
civilisation
and
the
protectors
of
its
remnants
were
the
determined
enemies
of
its
cleanliness
that
they
looked
on
personal
dirt
like
the
old
hermits
of
the
thebaid
as
a
sign
of
sanctity
and
discouraged
as
they
are
said
to
do
still
in
some
of
the
romance
countries
of
europe
the
use
of
the
bath
as
not
only
luxurious
but
also
indecent
at
which
answer
it
seems
to
me
another
sneer
might
curl
the
lip
of
the
august
shade
as
he
said
to
himself
this
at
least
i
did
not
expect
when
i
made
christianity
the
state
religion
of
my
empire
but
you
good
barbarian
look
clean
enough
you
do
not
look
on
dirt
as
a
sign
of
sanctity
on
the
contrary
sire
the
upper
classes
of
our
empire
boast
of
being
the
cleanliest
perhaps
the
only
perfectly
cleanly
people
in
the
world
except
of
course
the
savages
of
the
south
seas
and
dirt
is
so
far
from
being
a
thing
which
we
admire
that
our
scientific
men
than
whom
the
world
has
never
seen
wiser
have
proved
to
us
for
a
whole
generation
past
that
dirt
is
the
fertile
cause
of
disease
and
drunkenness
misery
and
recklessness
and
therefore
replies
the
shade
ere
he
disappears
of
discontent
and
revolution
followed
by
a
tyranny
endured
as
in
rome
and
many
another
place
by
men
once
free
because
tyranny
will
at
least
do
for
them
what
they
are
too
lazy
and
cowardly
and
greedy
to
do
for
themselves
farewell
and
prosper
as
you
seem
likely
to
prosper
on
the
whole
but
if
you
wish
me
to
consider
you
a
civilised
nation
let
me
hear
that
you
have
brought
a
great
river
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
be
they
a
thousand
fathoms
deep
or
from
your
nearest
mountains
be
they
five
hundred
miles
away
and
have
washed
out
london
dirt
and
your
own
shame
till
then
abstain
from
judging
too
harshly
a
constantine
or
even
a
caracalla
for
they
whatever
were
their
sins
built
baths
and
kept
their
people
clean
but
do
your
gymnasia
your
schools
and
universities
teach
your
youth
nought
about
all
this
thrift
a
lecture
delivered
at
winchester
march
ladies
i
have
chosen
for
the
title
of
this
lecture
a
practical
and
prosaic
word
because
i
intend
the
lecture
itself
to
be
as
practical
and
prosaic
as
i
can
make
it
without
becoming
altogether
dull
the
question
of
the
better
or
worse
education
of
women
is
one
far
too
important
for
vague
sentiment
wild
aspirations
or
utopian
dreams
it
is
a
practical
question
on
which
depends
not
merely
money
or
comfort
but
too
often
health
and
life
as
the
consequences
of
a
good
education
or
disease
and
death
i
know
too
well
of
what
i
speak
as
the
consequences
of
a
bad
one
i
beg
you
therefore
to
put
out
of
your
minds
at
the
outset
any
fancy
that
i
wish
for
a
social
revolution
in
the
position
of
women
or
that
i
wish
to
see
them
educated
by
exactly
the
same
methods
and
in
exactly
the
same
subjects
as
men
british
lads
on
an
average
are
far
too
still
in
spite
of
all
recent
improvements
for
me
to
wish
that
british
girls
should
be
taught
in
the
same
way
moreover
whatever
defects
there
may
have
been
and
defects
there
must
be
in
all
things
human
in
the
past
education
of
british
women
it
has
been
most
certainly
a
splendid
moral
success
it
has
made
by
the
grace
of
god
british
women
the
best
wives
mothers
daughters
aunts
sisters
that
the
world
as
far
as
i
can
discover
has
yet
seen
let
those
who
will
sneer
at
the
women
of
england
we
who
have
to
do
the
work
and
to
fight
the
battle
of
life
know
the
inspiration
which
we
derive
from
their
virtue
their
counsel
their
tenderness
and
but
too
often
from
their
compassion
and
their
forgiveness
there
is
i
doubt
not
still
left
in
england
many
a
man
with
chivalry
and
patriotism
enough
to
challenge
the
world
to
show
so
perfect
a
specimen
of
humanity
as
a
cultivated
british
woman
but
just
because
a
cultivated
british
woman
is
so
perfect
a
personage
therefore
i
wish
to
see
all
british
women
cultivated
because
the
womanhood
of
england
is
so
precious
a
treasure
i
wish
to
see
none
of
it
wasted
it
is
an
invaluable
capital
or
material
out
of
which
the
greatest
possible
profit
to
the
nation
must
be
made
and
that
can
only
be
done
by
thrift
and
that
again
can
only
be
attained
by
knowledge
consider
that
word
thrift
if
you
will
look
at
johnson
dictionary
or
if
you
know
your
shakespeare
you
will
see
that
thrift
signified
originally
profits
gain
riches
gotten
in
a
word
the
marks
of
a
thriving
how
then
did
the
word
thrift
get
to
mean
parsimony
frugality
the
opposite
of
waste
just
in
the
same
way
as
economy
which
first
of
course
meant
the
management
of
a
household
got
to
mean
also
the
opposite
of
waste
it
was
found
that
in
commerce
in
husbandry
in
any
process
in
fact
men
throve
in
proportion
as
they
saved
their
capital
their
material
their
force
now
this
is
a
great
law
which
runs
through
life
one
of
those
laws
of
nature
call
them
rather
laws
of
god
which
apply
not
merely
to
political
economy
to
commerce
and
to
mechanics
but
to
physiology
to
society
to
the
intellect
to
the
heart
of
every
person
in
this
room
the
secret
of
thriving
is
thrift
saving
of
force
to
get
as
much
work
as
possible
done
with
the
least
expenditure
of
power
the
least
jar
and
obstruction
the
least
wear
and
tear
and
the
secret
of
thrift
is
knowledge
in
proportion
as
you
know
the
laws
and
nature
of
a
subject
you
will
be
able
to
work
at
it
easily
surely
rapidly
successfully
instead
of
wasting
your
money
or
your
energies
in
mistaken
schemes
irregular
efforts
which
end
in
disappointment
and
exhaustion
the
secret
of
thrift
i
say
is
knowledge
the
more
you
know
the
more
you
can
save
yourself
and
that
which
belongs
to
you
and
can
do
more
work
with
less
effort
a
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
commercial
credit
we
all
know
saves
capital
enabling
a
less
capital
to
do
the
work
of
a
greater
knowledge
of
the
electric
telegraph
saves
time
knowledge
of
writing
saves
human
speech
and
locomotion
knowledge
of
domestic
economy
saves
income
knowledge
of
sanitary
laws
saves
health
and
life
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
the
intellect
saves
wear
and
tear
of
brain
and
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
the
spirit
what
does
it
not
save
a
moral
sense
a
character
saves
from
idleness
and
ennui
alternating
with
sentimentality
and
excitement
those
tenderer
emotions
those
deeper
passions
those
nobler
aspirations
of
humanity
which
are
the
heritage
of
the
woman
far
more
than
of
the
man
and
which
are
potent
in
her
for
evil
or
for
good
in
proportion
as
they
are
left
to
run
wild
and
undisciplined
or
are
trained
and
developed
into
graceful
harmonious
strength
beautiful
in
themselves
and
a
blessing
to
all
who
come
under
their
influence
what
therefore
i
recommend
to
ladies
in
this
lecture
is
thrift
thrift
of
themselves
and
of
their
own
powers
and
knowledge
as
the
parent
of
thrift
and
because
it
is
well
to
begin
with
the
lower
applications
of
thrift
and
to
work
up
to
the
higher
i
am
much
pleased
to
hear
that
the
first
course
of
the
proposed
lectures
to
women
in
this
place
will
be
one
on
domestic
economy
i
presume
that
the
learned
gentleman
who
will
deliver
these
lectures
will
be
the
last
to
mean
by
that
term
the
mere
saving
of
money
that
he
will
tell
you
as
being
a
german
he
will
have
good
reason
to
know
that
the
young
lady
who
learns
thrift
in
domestic
economy
is
also
learning
thrift
of
the
very
highest
faculties
of
her
immortal
spirit
he
will
tell
you
i
doubt
not
for
he
must
know
how
you
may
see
in
germany
young
ladies
living
in
what
we
more
luxurious
british
would
consider
something
like
poverty
cooking
waiting
at
table
and
performing
many
a
household
office
which
would
be
here
considered
menial
and
yet
finding
time
for
a
cultivation
of
the
intellect
which
is
unfortunately
too
rare
in
great
britain
the
truth
is
that
we
british
are
too
wealthy
we
make
money
if
not
too
rapidly
for
the
good
of
the
nation
at
large
yet
too
rapidly
i
fear
for
the
good
of
the
daughters
of
those
who
make
it
their
temptation
i
do
not
of
course
say
they
all
yield
to
it
but
their
temptation
is
to
waste
of
the
very
simplest
i
had
almost
said
if
i
may
be
pardoned
the
expression
of
the
most
barbaric
kind
to
an
oriental
waste
of
money
and
waste
of
time
to
a
fondness
for
mere
finery
pardonable
enough
but
still
a
waste
and
to
the
mistaken
fancy
that
it
is
the
mark
of
a
lady
to
sit
idle
and
let
servants
do
everything
for
her
such
women
may
well
take
a
lesson
by
contrast
from
the
pure
and
noble
useful
and
cultivated
thrift
of
an
average
german
young
lady
for
ladies
these
german
women
are
in
every
possible
sense
of
the
word
but
it
is
not
of
this
sort
of
waste
of
which
i
wish
to
speak
i
only
mention
the
matter
in
passing
to
show
that
high
intellectual
culture
is
not
incompatible
with
the
performance
of
homely
household
duties
and
that
the
moral
success
of
which
i
spoke
just
now
need
not
be
injured
any
more
than
it
is
in
germany
by
intellectual
success
likewise
i
trust
that
these
words
may
reassure
those
parents
if
any
such
there
be
here
who
may
fear
that
these
lectures
will
withdraw
women
from
their
existing
sphere
of
interest
and
activity
that
they
should
entertain
such
a
fear
is
not
surprising
after
the
extravagant
opinions
and
schemes
which
have
been
lately
broached
in
various
quarters
the
programme
to
these
lectures
expressly
disclaims
any
such
intentions
and
i
as
a
husband
and
a
father
expressly
disclaim
any
such
intention
likewise
to
fit
women
for
the
more
enlightened
performance
of
their
special
duties
to
help
them
towards
learning
how
to
do
better
what
we
doubt
not
they
are
already
doing
well
is
i
honestly
believe
the
only
object
of
the
promoters
of
this
scheme
let
us
see
now
how
some
of
these
special
duties
can
be
better
performed
by
help
of
a
little
enlightenment
as
to
the
laws
which
regulate
them
now
no
man
will
deny
certainly
no
man
who
is
past
and
whose
digestion
is
beginning
to
quail
before
the
lumps
of
beef
and
mutton
which
are
the
boast
of
a
british
kitchen
and
to
prefer
with
justice
shallow
and
i
presume
sir
john
falstaff
also
any
pretty
little
tiny
kickshaws
no
man
i
say
who
has
reached
that
age
but
will
feel
it
a
practical
comfort
to
him
to
know
that
the
young
ladies
of
his
family
are
at
all
events
good
cooks
and
understand
as
the
french
do
thrift
in
the
matter
of
food
neither
will
any
parent
who
wishes
naturally
enough
that
his
daughters
should
cost
him
as
little
as
possible
and
wishes
naturally
enough
also
that
they
should
be
as
well
dressed
as
possible
deny
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
them
to
be
practical
milliners
and
and
by
making
their
own
clothes
gracefully
and
well
exercise
thrift
in
clothing
but
beside
this
thrift
in
clothing
i
am
not
alone
i
believe
in
wishing
for
some
thrift
in
the
energy
which
produces
it
labour
misapplied
you
will
agree
is
labour
wasted
and
as
dress
i
presume
is
intended
to
adorn
the
person
of
the
wearer
the
making
a
dress
which
only
disfigures
her
may
be
considered
as
a
plain
case
of
waste
it
would
be
impertinent
in
me
to
go
into
any
details
but
it
is
impossible
to
walk
about
the
streets
now
without
passing
young
people
who
must
be
under
a
deep
delusion
as
to
the
success
of
their
own
toilette
instead
of
graceful
and
noble
simplicity
of
form
instead
of
combinations
of
colour
at
once
rich
and
delicate
because
in
accordance
with
the
chromatic
laws
of
nature
one
meets
with
phenomena
more
and
more
painful
to
the
eye
and
startling
to
common
sense
till
one
would
be
hardly
more
astonished
and
certainly
hardly
more
shocked
if
in
a
year
or
two
one
should
pass
some
one
going
about
like
a
chinese
lady
with
pinched
feet
or
like
a
savage
of
the
amazons
with
a
wooden
bung
through
her
lower
lip
it
is
easy
to
complain
of
these
monstrosities
but
impossible
to
cure
them
it
seems
to
me
without
an
education
of
the
taste
an
education
in
those
laws
of
nature
which
produce
beauty
in
form
and
beauty
in
colour
for
that
the
cause
of
these
failures
lies
in
want
of
education
is
patent
they
are
most
common
in
i
had
almost
said
they
are
confined
to
those
classes
of
persons
who
are
the
least
educated
who
have
no
standard
of
taste
of
their
own
and
who
do
not
acquire
any
from
cultivated
friends
and
relations
who
in
consequence
dress
themselves
blindly
according
to
what
they
conceive
to
be
the
paris
fashions
conveyed
at
through
an
equally
uneducated
dressmaker
in
innocent
ignorance
of
the
fact
for
fact
i
believe
it
to
be
that
paris
fashions
are
invented
now
not
in
the
least
for
the
sake
of
beauty
but
for
the
sake
of
producing
through
variety
increased
expenditure
and
thereby
increased
employment
according
to
the
strange
system
which
now
prevails
in
france
of
compelling
if
not
prosperity
at
least
the
signs
of
it
and
like
schoolboys
before
a
holiday
nailing
up
the
head
of
the
weather
glass
to
insure
fine
weather
let
british
ladies
educate
themselves
in
those
laws
of
beauty
which
are
as
eternal
as
any
other
of
nature
laws
which
may
be
seen
fulfilled
as
ruskin
tells
us
so
eloquently
in
every
flower
and
every
leaf
in
every
sweeping
down
and
rippling
wave
and
they
will
be
able
to
invent
graceful
and
economical
dresses
for
themselves
without
importing
tawdry
and
expensive
ugliness
from
france
let
me
now
go
a
step
further
and
ask
you
to
consider
there
are
in
england
now
a
vast
number
and
an
increasing
number
of
young
women
who
from
various
circumstances
which
we
all
know
must
in
after
life
be
either
the
mistresses
of
their
own
fortunes
or
the
earners
of
their
own
bread
and
to
do
that
wisely
and
well
they
must
be
more
or
less
women
of
business
and
to
be
women
of
business
they
must
know
something
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
capital
profit
price
value
labour
wages
and
of
the
relation
between
those
two
last
in
a
word
they
must
know
a
little
political
economy
nay
i
sometimes
think
that
the
mistress
of
every
household
might
find
not
only
thrift
of
money
but
thrift
of
brain
freedom
from
mistakes
anxieties
worries
of
many
kinds
all
of
which
eat
out
the
health
as
well
as
the
heart
by
a
little
sound
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
political
economy
when
we
consider
that
every
mistress
of
a
household
is
continually
buying
if
not
selling
that
she
is
continually
hiring
and
employing
labour
in
the
form
of
servants
and
very
often
into
the
bargain
keeping
her
husband
accounts
i
can
not
but
think
that
her
brain
might
be
clearer
and
her
desire
to
do
her
duty
by
every
subject
in
her
little
kingdom
might
be
more
easily
satisfied
had
she
read
something
of
what
john
stuart
mill
has
written
especially
on
the
duties
of
employer
and
employed
a
capitalist
a
commercialist
an
employer
of
labour
and
an
accountant
every
mistress
of
a
household
is
all
these
whether
she
likes
it
or
not
and
it
would
be
surely
well
for
her
in
so
very
complicated
a
state
of
society
as
this
not
to
trust
merely
to
that
that
intuitive
sagacity
and
innate
power
of
ruling
her
which
carries
women
so
nobly
through
their
work
in
simpler
and
less
civilised
societies
and
here
i
stop
to
answer
those
who
may
say
as
i
have
heard
it
said
that
a
woman
intellect
is
not
fit
for
business
that
when
a
woman
takes
to
business
she
is
apt
to
do
it
ill
and
unpleasantly
likewise
to
be
more
suspicious
more
irritable
more
grasping
more
unreasonable
than
regular
men
of
business
would
be
that
as
i
have
heard
it
put
a
woman
does
not
fight
fair
the
answer
is
simple
that
a
woman
intellect
is
eminently
fitted
for
business
is
proved
by
the
enormous
amount
of
business
she
gets
through
without
any
special
training
for
it
but
those
faults
in
a
woman
of
which
some
men
complain
are
simply
the
results
of
her
not
having
had
a
special
training
she
does
not
know
the
laws
of
business
she
does
not
know
the
rules
of
the
game
she
is
playing
and
therefore
she
is
playing
it
in
the
dark
in
fear
and
suspicion
apt
to
judge
of
questions
on
personal
grounds
often
offending
those
with
whom
she
has
to
do
and
oftener
still
making
herself
miserable
over
matters
of
law
or
of
business
on
which
a
little
sound
knowledge
would
set
her
head
and
her
heart
at
rest
when
i
have
seen
widows
having
the
care
of
children
of
a
great
household
of
a
great
estate
of
a
great
business
struggling
heroically
and
yet
often
mistakenly
blamed
severely
for
selfishness
and
ambition
while
they
were
really
sacrificing
themselves
with
the
divine
instinct
of
a
mother
for
their
children
interest
i
have
stood
by
with
mingled
admiration
and
pity
and
said
to
myself
how
nobly
she
is
doing
the
work
without
teaching
how
much
more
nobly
would
she
have
done
it
had
she
been
taught
she
is
now
doing
the
work
at
the
most
enormous
waste
of
energy
and
of
virtue
had
she
had
knowledge
thrift
would
have
followed
it
she
would
have
done
more
work
with
far
less
trouble
she
will
probably
kill
herself
if
she
goes
on
sound
knowledge
would
have
saved
her
health
saved
her
heart
saved
her
friends
and
helped
the
very
loved
ones
for
whom
she
labours
not
always
with
success
a
little
political
economy
therefore
will
at
least
do
no
harm
to
a
woman
especially
if
she
have
to
take
care
of
herself
in
after
life
neither
i
think
will
she
be
much
harmed
by
some
sound
knowledge
of
another
subject
which
i
see
promised
in
these
lectures
natural
philosophy
in
its
various
branches
such
as
the
chemistry
of
common
life
light
heat
electricity
a
little
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
light
for
instance
would
teach
many
women
that
by
shutting
themselves
up
day
after
day
week
after
week
in
darkened
rooms
they
are
as
certainly
committing
a
waste
of
health
destroying
their
vital
energy
and
diseasing
their
brains
as
if
they
were
taking
so
much
poison
the
whole
time
a
little
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
heat
would
teach
women
not
to
clothe
themselves
and
their
children
after
foolish
and
insufficient
fashions
which
in
this
climate
sow
the
seeds
of
a
dozen
different
diseases
and
have
to
be
atoned
for
by
perpetual
anxieties
and
by
perpetual
bills
and
as
for
a
little
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
electricity
one
thrift
i
am
sure
it
would
produce
thrift
to
us
men
of
having
to
answer
continual
inquiries
as
to
what
the
weather
is
going
to
be
when
a
slight
knowledge
of
the
barometer
or
of
the
form
of
the
clouds
and
the
direction
of
the
wind
would
enable
many
a
lady
to
judge
for
herself
and
not
after
inquiry
on
inquiry
disregard
all
warnings
go
out
on
the
first
appearance
of
a
strip
of
blue
sky
and
come
home
wet
through
with
what
she
calls
only
a
chill
but
which
really
means
a
nail
driven
into
her
coffin
a
probable
shortening
though
it
may
be
a
very
small
one
of
her
mortal
life
because
the
food
of
the
next
hours
which
should
have
gone
to
keep
the
vital
heat
at
its
normal
standard
will
have
to
be
wasted
in
raising
it
up
to
that
standard
from
which
it
has
fallen
by
a
chill
ladies
these
are
subjects
on
which
i
must
beg
to
speak
a
little
more
at
length
premising
them
by
one
statement
which
may
seem
jest
but
is
solemn
earnest
that
if
the
medical
men
of
this
or
any
other
city
were
what
the
world
now
calls
alive
to
their
own
interests
that
is
to
the
mere
making
of
money
instead
of
being
what
medical
men
are
the
most
generous
disinterested
and
class
in
these
realms
then
they
would
oppose
by
all
means
in
their
power
the
delivery
of
lectures
on
natural
philosophy
to
women
for
if
women
act
upon
what
they
learn
in
those
lectures
and
having
women
hearts
they
will
act
upon
it
there
ought
to
follow
a
decrease
of
sickness
and
an
increase
of
health
especially
among
children
a
thrift
of
life
and
a
thrift
of
expense
besides
which
would
very
seriously
affect
the
income
of
medical
men
for
let
me
ask
you
ladies
with
all
courtesy
but
with
all
earnestness
are
you
aware
of
certain
facts
of
which
every
one
of
those
excellent
medical
men
is
too
well
aware
are
you
aware
that
more
human
beings
are
killed
in
england
every
year
by
unnecessary
and
preventable
diseases
than
were
killed
at
waterloo
or
at
sadowa
are
you
aware
that
the
great
majority
of
those
victims
are
children
are
you
aware
that
the
diseases
which
carry
them
off
are
for
the
most
part
such
as
ought
to
be
specially
under
the
control
of
the
women
who
love
them
pet
them
educate
them
and
would
in
many
cases
if
need
be
lay
down
their
lives
for
them
are
you
aware
again
of
the
vast
amount
of
disease
which
so
both
wise
mothers
and
wise
doctors
assure
me
is
engendered
in
the
from
simple
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
ventilation
and
in
the
likewise
from
simple
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
physiology
from
an
ignorance
of
which
i
shall
mention
no
other
case
here
save
one
that
too
often
from
ignorance
of
signs
of
approaching
disease
a
child
is
punished
for
what
is
called
idleness
listlessness
wilfulness
sulkiness
and
punished
too
in
the
unwisest
way
by
an
increase
of
tasks
and
confinement
to
the
house
thus
overtasking
still
more
a
brain
already
overtasked
and
depressing
still
more
by
robbing
it
of
oxygen
and
of
exercise
a
system
already
depressed
are
you
aware
i
ask
again
of
all
this
i
speak
earnestly
upon
this
point
because
i
speak
with
experience
as
a
single
instance
a
medical
man
a
friend
of
mine
passing
by
his
own
heard
one
of
his
own
little
girls
screaming
and
crying
and
went
in
the
governess
an
excellent
woman
but
wholly
ignorant
of
the
laws
of
physiology
complained
that
the
child
had
of
late
become
obstinate
and
would
not
learn
and
that
therefore
she
must
punish
her
by
keeping
her
indoors
over
the
unlearnt
lessons
the
father
who
knew
that
the
child
was
usually
a
very
good
one
looked
at
her
carefully
for
a
little
while
sent
her
out
of
the
and
then
said
that
child
must
not
open
a
book
for
a
month
if
i
had
not
acted
so
he
said
to
me
i
should
have
had
that
child
dead
of
disease
within
the
year
now
in
the
face
of
such
facts
as
these
is
it
too
much
to
ask
of
mothers
sisters
aunts
nurses
governesses
all
who
may
be
occupied
in
the
care
of
children
especially
of
girls
that
they
should
study
thrift
of
human
health
and
human
life
by
studying
somewhat
the
laws
of
life
and
health
there
are
books
i
may
say
a
whole
literature
of
books
written
by
scientific
doctors
on
these
matters
which
are
in
my
mind
far
more
important
to
the
than
half
the
trashy
accomplishments
called
which
are
expected
to
be
known
by
governesses
but
are
they
bought
are
they
even
to
be
bought
from
most
country
booksellers
ah
for
a
little
knowledge
of
the
laws
to
the
neglect
of
which
is
owing
so
much
fearful
disease
which
if
it
does
not
produce
immediate
death
too
often
leaves
the
constitution
impaired
for
years
to
come
ah
the
waste
of
health
and
strength
in
the
young
the
waste
too
of
anxiety
and
misery
in
those
who
love
and
tend
them
how
much
of
it
might
be
saved
by
a
little
rational
education
in
those
laws
of
nature
which
are
the
will
of
god
about
the
welfare
of
our
bodies
and
which
therefore
we
are
as
much
bound
to
know
and
to
obey
as
we
are
bound
to
know
and
obey
the
spiritual
laws
whereon
depends
the
welfare
of
our
souls
pardon
me
ladies
if
i
have
given
a
moment
pain
to
any
one
here
but
i
appeal
to
every
medical
man
in
the
room
whether
i
have
not
spoken
the
truth
and
having
such
an
opportunity
as
this
i
felt
that
i
must
speak
for
the
sake
of
children
and
of
women
likewise
or
else
for
ever
hereafter
hold
my
peace
let
me
pass
on
from
this
painful
subject
for
painful
it
has
been
to
me
for
many
years
to
a
question
of
intellectual
thrift
by
which
i
mean
just
now
thrift
of
words
thrift
of
truth
restraint
of
the
tongue
accuracy
and
modesty
in
statement
mothers
complain
to
me
that
girls
are
apt
to
be
not
intentionally
untruthful
but
exaggerative
prejudiced
incorrect
in
repeating
a
conversation
or
describing
an
event
and
that
from
this
fault
arise
as
is
to
be
expected
misunderstandings
quarrels
rumours
slanders
scandals
and
what
not
now
for
this
waste
of
words
there
is
but
one
cure
and
if
i
be
told
that
it
is
a
natural
fault
of
women
that
they
can
not
take
the
calm
judicial
view
of
matters
which
men
boast
and
often
boast
most
wrongly
that
they
can
take
that
under
the
influence
of
hope
fear
delicate
antipathy
honest
moral
indignation
they
will
let
their
eyes
and
ears
be
governed
by
their
feelings
and
see
and
hear
only
what
they
wish
to
see
and
hear
i
answer
that
it
is
not
for
me
as
a
man
to
start
such
a
theory
but
that
if
it
be
true
it
is
an
additional
argument
for
some
education
which
will
correct
this
supposed
natural
defect
and
i
say
deliberately
that
there
is
but
one
sort
of
education
which
will
correct
it
one
which
will
teach
young
women
to
observe
facts
accurately
judge
them
calmly
and
describe
them
carefully
without
adding
or
distorting
and
that
is
some
training
in
natural
science
i
beg
you
not
to
be
startled
but
if
you
are
then
test
the
truth
of
my
theory
by
playing
at
the
game
called
russian
scandal
in
which
a
story
repeated
in
secret
by
one
player
to
the
other
comes
out
at
the
end
of
the
game
owing
to
the
inaccurate
and
forgive
me
if
i
say
it
uneducated
brains
through
which
it
has
passed
utterly
unlike
its
original
not
only
ludicrously
maimed
and
distorted
but
often
with
the
most
fantastic
additions
of
events
details
names
dates
places
which
each
player
will
aver
that
he
received
from
the
player
before
him
i
am
afraid
that
too
much
of
the
average
gossip
of
every
city
town
and
village
is
little
more
than
a
game
of
russian
scandal
with
this
difference
that
while
one
is
but
a
game
the
other
is
but
too
mischievous
earnest
but
now
if
among
your
party
there
shall
be
an
average
lawyer
medical
man
or
man
of
science
you
will
find
that
he
and
perhaps
he
alone
will
be
able
to
retail
accurately
the
story
which
has
been
told
him
and
why
simply
because
his
mind
has
been
trained
to
deal
with
facts
to
ascertain
exactly
what
he
does
see
or
hear
and
to
imprint
its
leading
features
strongly
and
clearly
on
his
memory
now
you
certainly
can
not
make
young
ladies
barristers
or
attorneys
nor
employ
their
brains
in
getting
up
cases
civil
or
criminal
and
as
for
chemistry
they
and
their
parents
may
have
a
reasonable
antipathy
to
smells
blackened
fingers
and
occasional
explosions
and
poisonings
but
you
may
make
them
something
of
botanists
zoologists
geologists
i
could
say
much
on
this
point
allow
me
at
least
to
say
this
i
verily
believe
that
any
young
lady
who
would
employ
some
of
her
leisure
time
in
collecting
wild
flowers
carefully
examining
them
verifying
them
and
arranging
them
or
who
would
in
her
summer
trip
to
the
do
the
same
by
the
common
objects
of
the
shore
instead
of
wasting
her
holiday
as
one
sees
hundreds
doing
in
lounging
on
benches
on
the
esplanade
reading
worthless
novels
and
criticizing
dresses
that
such
a
young
lady
i
say
would
not
only
open
her
own
mind
to
a
world
of
wonder
beauty
and
wisdom
which
if
it
did
not
make
her
a
more
reverent
and
pious
soul
she
can
not
be
the
woman
which
i
take
for
granted
she
is
but
would
save
herself
from
the
habit
i
had
almost
said
the
necessity
of
gossip
because
she
would
have
things
to
think
of
and
not
merely
persons
facts
instead
of
fancies
while
she
would
acquire
something
of
accuracy
of
patience
of
methodical
observation
and
judgment
which
would
stand
her
in
good
stead
in
the
events
of
daily
life
and
increase
her
power
of
bridling
her
tongue
and
her
imagination
god
is
in
heaven
and
thou
upon
earth
therefore
let
thy
words
be
few
is
the
lesson
which
those
are
learning
all
day
long
who
study
the
works
of
god
with
reverent
accuracy
lest
by
misrepresenting
them
they
should
be
tempted
to
say
that
god
has
done
that
which
he
has
not
and
in
that
wholesome
discipline
i
long
that
women
as
well
as
men
should
share
and
now
i
come
to
a
thrift
of
the
highest
kind
as
contrasted
with
a
waste
the
most
deplorable
and
ruinous
of
all
thrift
of
those
faculties
which
connect
us
with
the
unseen
and
spiritual
world
with
humanity
with
christ
with
god
thrift
of
the
immortal
spirit
i
am
not
going
now
to
give
you
a
sermon
on
duty
you
hear
such
i
doubt
not
in
church
every
sunday
far
better
than
i
can
preach
to
you
i
am
going
to
speak
rather
of
thrift
of
the
heart
thrift
of
the
emotions
how
they
are
wasted
in
these
days
in
reading
what
are
called
sensation
novels
all
know
but
too
well
how
british
literature
all
that
the
best
hearts
and
intellects
among
our
forefathers
have
bequeathed
to
us
is
neglected
for
light
fiction
the
reading
of
which
is
as
a
lady
well
said
the
worst
form
of
intemperance
and
intellectual
and
moral
i
know
that
the
young
will
delight
they
have
delighted
in
all
ages
and
will
to
the
end
of
time
in
fictions
which
deal
with
that
oldest
tale
which
is
for
ever
new
novels
will
be
read
but
that
is
all
the
more
reason
why
women
should
be
trained
by
the
perusal
of
a
higher
broader
deeper
literature
to
distinguish
the
good
novel
from
the
bad
the
moral
from
the
immoral
the
noble
from
the
base
the
true
work
of
art
from
the
sham
which
hides
its
shallowness
and
vulgarity
under
a
tangled
plot
and
melodramatic
situations
she
should
learn
and
that
she
can
only
learn
by
cultivation
to
discern
with
joy
and
drink
in
with
reverence
the
good
the
beautiful
and
the
true
and
to
turn
with
the
fine
scorn
of
a
pure
and
strong
womanhood
from
the
bad
the
ugly
and
the
false
and
if
any
parent
should
be
inclined
to
reply
why
lay
so
much
stress
upon
educating
a
girl
in
british
literature
is
it
not
far
more
important
to
make
our
daughters
read
religious
books
i
answer
of
course
it
is
i
take
for
granted
that
that
is
done
in
a
christian
land
but
i
beg
you
to
recollect
that
there
are
books
and
books
and
that
in
these
days
of
a
free
press
it
is
impossible
in
the
long
run
to
prevent
girls
reading
books
of
very
different
shades
of
opinion
and
very
different
religious
worth
it
may
be
therefore
of
the
very
highest
importance
to
a
girl
to
have
her
intellect
her
taste
her
emotions
her
moral
sense
in
a
word
her
whole
womanhood
so
cultivated
and
regulated
that
she
shall
herself
be
able
to
discern
the
true
from
the
false
the
orthodox
from
the
unorthodox
the
truly
devout
from
the
merely
sentimental
the
gospel
from
its
counterfeits
i
should
have
thought
that
there
never
had
been
in
britain
since
the
reformation
a
crisis
at
which
young
englishwomen
required
more
careful
cultivation
on
these
matters
if
at
least
they
are
to
be
saved
from
making
themselves
and
their
families
miserable
and
from
ending
as
i
have
known
too
many
end
with
broken
hearts
broken
brains
broken
health
and
an
early
grave
take
warning
by
what
you
see
abroad
in
every
country
where
the
women
are
uneducated
unoccupied
where
their
only
literature
is
french
novels
or
translations
of
them
in
every
one
of
those
countries
the
women
even
to
the
highest
are
the
slaves
of
superstition
and
the
puppets
of
priests
in
proportion
as
in
certain
other
countries
notably
i
will
say
in
scotland
the
women
are
highly
educated
family
life
and
family
secrets
are
sacred
and
the
woman
owns
allegiance
and
devotion
to
no
confessor
or
director
but
to
her
own
husband
or
to
her
own
family
i
say
plainly
that
if
any
parents
wish
their
daughters
to
succumb
at
last
to
some
quackery
or
superstition
whether
calling
itself
scientific
or
calling
itself
religious
and
there
are
too
many
of
both
just
now
they
can
not
more
certainly
effect
their
purpose
than
by
allowing
her
to
grow
up
ignorant
frivolous
luxurious
vain
with
her
emotions
excited
but
not
satisfied
by
the
reading
of
foolish
and
even
immoral
novels
in
such
a
case
the
more
delicate
and
graceful
the
organization
the
more
noble
and
earnest
the
nature
which
has
been
neglected
the
more
certain
it
is
i
know
too
well
what
i
am
saying
to
go
astray
the
time
of
depression
disappointment
vacuity
all
but
despair
must
come
the
immortal
spirit
finding
no
healthy
satisfaction
for
its
highest
aspirations
is
but
too
likely
to
betake
itself
to
an
unhealthy
and
exciting
superstition
ashamed
of
its
own
long
it
is
but
too
likely
to
flee
from
itself
into
a
morbid
asceticism
not
having
been
taught
its
and
natural
duties
in
the
world
it
is
but
too
likely
to
betake
itself
from
the
mere
craving
for
action
to
and
unnatural
duties
out
of
the
world
ignorant
of
true
science
yet
craving
to
understand
the
wonders
of
nature
and
of
spirit
it
is
but
too
likely
to
betake
itself
to
nonscience
nonsense
as
it
is
usually
called
whether
of
and
mesmerism
or
of
miraculous
relics
and
winking
pictures
longing
for
guidance
and
teaching
and
never
having
been
taught
to
guide
and
teach
itself
it
is
but
too
likely
to
deliver
itself
up
in
to
the
guidance
and
teaching
of
those
who
whether
they
be
quacks
or
fanatics
look
on
uneducated
women
as
their
natural
prey
you
will
see
i
am
sure
from
what
i
have
said
that
it
is
not
my
wish
that
you
should
become
mere
learned
women
mere
female
pedants
as
useless
and
unpleasing
as
male
pedants
are
wont
to
be
the
education
which
i
set
before
you
is
not
to
be
got
by
mere
hearing
lectures
or
reading
books
for
it
is
an
education
of
your
whole
character
a
education
which
really
means
a
committing
of
yourself
to
god
that
he
may
educate
you
hearing
lectures
is
good
for
it
will
teach
you
how
much
there
is
to
be
known
and
how
little
you
know
reading
books
is
good
for
it
will
give
you
habits
of
regular
and
diligent
study
and
therefore
i
urge
on
you
strongly
private
study
especially
in
case
a
library
should
be
formed
here
of
books
on
those
most
practical
subjects
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
but
after
all
both
lectures
and
books
are
good
mainly
in
as
far
as
they
furnish
matter
for
reflection
while
the
desire
to
reflect
and
the
ability
to
reflect
must
come
as
i
believe
from
above
the
honest
craving
after
light
and
power
after
knowledge
wisdom
active
usefulness
must
come
and
may
it
come
to
you
by
the
inspiration
of
the
spirit
of
god
one
word
more
and
i
have
done
let
me
ask
women
to
educate
themselves
not
for
their
own
sakes
merely
but
for
the
sake
of
others
for
whether
they
will
or
not
they
must
educate
others
i
do
not
speak
merely
of
those
who
may
be
engaged
in
the
work
of
direct
teaching
that
they
ought
to
be
well
taught
themselves
who
can
doubt
i
speak
of
those
and
in
so
doing
i
speak
of
every
woman
young
and
old
who
exercises
as
wife
as
mother
as
aunt
as
sister
or
as
friend
an
influence
indirect
it
may
be
and
unconscious
but
still
potent
and
practical
on
the
minds
and
characters
of
those
about
them
especially
of
men
how
potent
and
practical
that
influence
is
those
know
best
who
know
most
of
the
world
and
most
of
human
nature
there
are
those
who
consider
and
i
agree
with
them
that
the
education
of
boys
under
the
age
of
twelve
years
ought
to
be
entrusted
as
much
as
possible
to
women
let
me
ask
of
what
period
of
youth
and
of
manhood
does
not
the
same
hold
true
i
pity
the
ignorance
and
conceit
of
the
man
who
fancies
that
he
has
nothing
left
to
learn
from
cultivated
women
i
should
have
thought
that
the
very
mission
of
woman
was
to
be
in
the
highest
sense
the
educator
of
man
from
infancy
to
old
age
that
that
was
the
work
towards
which
all
the
capacities
of
women
pointed
for
which
they
were
to
be
educated
to
the
highest
pitch
i
should
have
thought
that
it
was
the
glory
of
woman
that
she
was
sent
into
the
world
to
live
for
others
rather
than
for
herself
and
therefore
i
should
say
let
her
smallest
rights
be
respected
her
smallest
wrongs
redressed
but
let
her
never
be
persuaded
to
forget
that
she
is
sent
into
the
world
to
teach
man
what
i
believe
she
has
been
teaching
him
all
along
even
in
the
savage
state
namely
that
there
is
something
more
necessary
than
the
claiming
of
rights
and
that
is
the
performing
of
duties
to
teach
him
specially
in
these
intellectual
days
that
there
is
something
more
than
intellect
and
that
is
purity
and
virtue
let
her
never
be
persuaded
to
forget
that
her
calling
is
not
the
lower
and
more
earthly
one
of
but
the
higher
and
the
diviner
calling
of
and
let
her
never
desert
that
higher
life
which
lives
in
others
and
for
others
like
her
redeemer
and
her
lord
and
if
any
should
answer
that
this
doctrine
would
keep
woman
a
dependant
and
a
slave
i
rejoin
not
so
it
would
keep
her
what
she
should
be
the
mistress
of
all
around
her
because
mistress
of
herself
and
more
i
should
express
a
fear
that
those
who
made
that
answer
had
not
yet
seen
into
the
mystery
of
true
greatness
and
true
strength
that
they
did
not
yet
understand
the
true
magnanimity
the
true
royalty
of
that
spirit
by
which
the
son
of
man
came
not
to
be
ministered
unto
but
to
minister
and
to
give
his
life
a
ransom
for
many
surely
that
is
woman
calling
to
teach
man
and
to
teach
him
what
to
teach
him
after
all
that
his
calling
is
the

the
things
which
belong
to
his
peace
to
temper
his
fiercer
coarser
more
nature
by
the
contact
of
her
gentleness
purity
to
make
him
see
that
not
by
blare
of
trumpets
not
by
noise
wrath
greed
ambition
intrigue
puffery
is
good
and
lasting
work
to
be
done
on
earth
but
by
wise
by
silent
labour
by
lofty
by
that
charity
which
hopeth
all
things
believeth
all
things
endureth
all
things
by
such
an
example
in
short
as
women
now
in
tens
of
thousands
set
to
those
around
them
such
as
they
will
show
more
and
more
the
more
their
whole
womanhood
is
educated
to
employ
its
powers
without
waste
and
without
haste
in
harmonious
unity
let
the
woman
begin
in
girlhood
if
such
be
her
happy
lot
to
quote
the
words
of
a
great
poet
a
great
philosopher
and
a
great
churchman
william
wordsworth
let
her
begin
i
say
with
all
things
round
about
her
drawn
from
and
the
cheerful
dawn
a
dancing
shape
an
image
gay
to
haunt
to
startle
and
waylay
let
her
develop
onwards
a
spirit
yet
a
woman
too
with
household
motions
light
and
free
and
steps
of
virgin
liberty
a
countenance
in
which
shall
meet
sweet
records
promises
as
sweet
a
creature
not
too
bright
and
good
for
human
nature
daily
food
for
transient
sorrows
simple
wiles
praise
blame
love
kisses
tears
and
smiles
but
let
her
highest
and
her
final
development
be
that
which
not
nature
but
alone
can
bring
that
which
makes
her
once
and
for
ever
a
being
breathing
thoughtful
breath
a
traveller
betwixt
life
and
death
with
reason
firm
with
temperate
will
endurance
foresight
strength
and
skill
a
perfect
woman
nobly
planned
to
warn
to
comfort
and
command
and
yet
a
spirit
still
and
bright
with
something
of
an
angel
light
the
study
of
natural
history
a
lecture
delivered
to
the
officers
of
the
royal
artillery
woolwich
gentlemen
when
i
accepted
the
honour
of
lecturing
here
i
took
for
granted
that
so
select
an
audience
would
expect
from
me
not
mere
amusement
but
somewhat
of
instruction
or
if
that
be
too
ambitious
a
word
for
me
to
use
at
least
some
fresh
hint
if
i
were
able
to
give
one
as
to
how
they
should
fulfil
the
ideal
of
military
men
in
such
an
age
as
this
to
touch
on
military
matters
even
had
i
been
conversant
with
them
seemed
to
me
an
impertinence
i
am
bound
to
take
for
granted
that
every
man
knows
his
own
business
best
and
i
incline
more
and
more
to
the
opinion
that
military
men
should
be
left
to
work
out
the
problems
of
their
art
for
themselves
without
the
advice
or
criticism
of
civilians
but
i
hold
and
i
am
sure
that
you
will
agree
with
me
that
if
the
soldier
is
to
be
thus
trusted
by
the
nation
and
left
to
himself
to
do
his
own
work
his
own
way
he
must
be
educated
in
all
practical
matters
as
highly
as
the
average
of
educated
civilians
he
must
know
all
that
they
know
and
his
own
art
beside
just
as
a
clergyman
being
a
man
plus
a
priest
is
bound
to
be
a
man
and
a
good
man
over
and
above
his
priesthood
so
is
the
soldier
bound
to
be
a
civilian
and
a
civilian
plus
his
soldierly
qualities
and
acquirements
it
seemed
to
me
therefore
that
i
might
without
impertinence
ask
you
to
consider
a
branch
of
knowledge
which
is
becoming
yearly
more
and
more
important
in
the
eyes
of
civilians
of
which
therefore
the
soldier
ought
at
least
to
know
something
in
order
to
put
him
on
a
par
with
the
general
intelligence
of
the
nation
i
do
not
say
that
he
is
to
devote
much
time
to
it
or
to
follow
it
up
into
specialities
but
that
he
ought
to
be
well
grounded
in
its
principles
and
methods
that
he
ought
to
be
aware
of
its
importance
and
its
usefulness
that
so
if
he
comes
into
contact
as
he
will
more
and
more
with
scientific
men
he
may
understand
them
respect
them
befriend
them
and
be
befriended
by
them
in
turn
and
how
desirable
this
last
result
is
i
shall
tell
you
hereafter
there
are
those
i
doubt
not
among
my
audience
who
do
not
need
the
advice
which
i
shall
presume
to
give
who
belong
to
that
fast
increasing
class
among
officers
of
whom
i
have
often
said
and
i
have
found
scientific
men
cordially
agree
with
me
that
they
are
the
most
modest
and
the
most
teachable
of
men
but
even
in
their
case
there
can
be
no
harm
in
going
over
deliberately
a
question
of
such
importance
in
putting
it
as
it
were
into
shape
and
insisting
on
arguments
which
may
perhaps
not
have
occurred
to
some
of
them
let
me
in
the
first
place
reassure
those
if
any
such
there
be
who
may
suppose
from
the
title
of
my
lecture
that
i
am
only
going
to
recommend
them
to
collect
weeds
and
butterflies
rats
and
mice
and
such
small
deer
far
from
it
the
honourable
title
of
natural
history
has
and
unwisely
been
restricted
too
much
of
late
years
to
the
mere
study
of
plants
and
animals
i
desire
to
restore
the
words
to
their
original
and
proper
meaning
the
history
of
nature
that
is
of
all
that
is
born
and
grows
in
time
in
short
of
all
natural
objects
if
anyone
shall
say
by
that
definition
you
make
not
only
geology
and
chemistry
branches
of
natural
history
but
meteorology
and
astronomy
likewise
i
can
not
deny
it
they
deal
each
of
them
with
realms
of
nature
geology
is
literally
the
natural
history
of
soils
and
lands
chemistry
the
natural
history
of
compounds
organic
and
inorganic
meteorology
the
natural
history
of
climates
astronomy
the
natural
history
of
planetary
and
solar
bodies
and
more
you
can
not
now
study
deeply
any
branch
of
what
is
popularly
called
natural
history
that
is
plants
and
animals
without
finding
it
necessary
to
learn
something
and
more
and
more
as
you
go
deeper
of
those
very
sciences
as
the
marvellous
interdependence
of
all
natural
objects
and
forces
unfolds
itself
more
and
more
so
the
once
separate
sciences
which
treated
of
different
classes
of
natural
objects
are
forced
to
interpenetrate
as
it
were
and
to
supplement
themselves
by
knowledge
borrowed
from
each
other
thus
to
give
a
single
instance
no
man
can
now
be
a
botanist
unless
he
be
also
no
mean
meteorologist
no
mean
geologist
and
as
darwin
has
shown
in
his
extraordinary
discoveries
about
the
fertilisation
of
plants
by
insects
no
mean
entomologist
likewise
it
is
difficult
therefore
and
indeed
somewhat
unwise
and
unfair
to
put
any
limit
to
the
term
natural
history
save
that
it
shall
deal
only
with
nature
and
with
matter
and
shall
not
pretend
as
some
would
have
it
to
do
just
now
to
go
out
of
its
own
sphere
to
meddle
with
moral
and
spiritual
matters
but
for
practical
purposes
we
may
define
the
natural
history
of
any
given
spot
as
the
history
of
the
causes
which
have
made
it
what
it
is
and
filled
it
with
the
natural
objects
which
it
holds
and
if
anyone
would
know
how
to
study
the
natural
history
of
a
place
and
how
to
write
it
let
him
read
and
if
he
has
read
its
delightful
pages
in
youth
read
once
again
that
hitherto
unrivalled
little
monograph
white
history
of
selborne
and
let
him
then
try
by
the
light
of
improved
science
to
do
for
any
district
where
he
may
be
stationed
what
white
did
for
selborne
nearly
one
hundred
years
ago
let
him
study
its
plants
its
animals
its
soils
and
rocks
and
last
but
not
least
its
scenery
as
the
total
outcome
of
what
the
soils
and
plants
and
animals
have
made
it
i
say
have
made
it
how
far
the
nature
of
the
soils
and
the
rocks
will
affect
the
scenery
of
a
district
may
be
well
learnt
from
a
very
clever
and
interesting
little
book
of
professor
geikie
on
scenery
of
scotland
as
affected
by
its
geological
structure
how
far
the
plants
and
trees
affect
not
merely
the
general
beauty
the
richness
or
barrenness
of
a
country
but
also
its
very
shape
the
rate
at
which
the
hills
are
destroyed
and
washed
into
the
lowland
the
rate
at
which
the
seaboard
is
being
removed
by
the
action
of
waves
all
these
are
branches
of
study
which
is
becoming
more
and
more
important
and
even
in
the
study
of
animals
and
their
effects
on
the
vegetation
questions
of
really
deep
interest
will
arise
you
will
find
that
certain
plants
and
trees
can
not
thrive
in
a
district
while
others
can
because
the
former
are
browsed
down
by
cattle
or
their
seeds
eaten
by
birds
and
the
latter
are
not
that
certain
seeds
are
carried
in
the
coats
of
animals
or
wafted
abroad
by
winds
others
are
not
certain
trees
destroyed
wholesale
by
insects
while
others
are
not
that
in
a
hundred
ways
the
animal
and
vegetable
life
of
a
district
act
and
react
upon
each
other
and
that
the
climate
the
average
temperature
the
maximum
and
minimum
temperatures
the
rainfall
act
on
them
and
in
the
case
of
the
vegetation
are
reacted
on
again
by
them
the
diminution
of
rainfall
by
the
destruction
of
forests
its
increase
by
replanting
them
and
the
effect
of
both
on
the
healthiness
or
unhealthiness
of
a
place
as
in
the
case
of
the
mauritius
where
a
once
healthy
island
has
become
pestilential
seemingly
from
the
clearing
away
of
the
vegetation
on
the
banks
of
streams
all
this
though
to
study
it
deeply
requires
a
fair
knowledge
of
meteorology
and
even
of
a
science
or
two
more
is
surely
well
worth
the
attention
of
any
educated
man
who
is
put
in
charge
of
the
health
and
lives
of
human
beings
you
will
surely
agree
with
me
that
the
habit
of
mind
required
for
such
a
study
as
this
is
the
very
same
as
is
required
for
successful
military
study
in
fact
i
should
say
that
the
same
intellect
which
would
develop
into
a
great
military
man
would
develop
also
into
a
great
naturalist
i
say
intellect
the
military
man
would
require
what
the
naturalist
would
not
over
and
above
his
intellect
a
special
force
of
will
in
order
to
translate
his
theories
into
fact
and
make
his
campaigns
in
the
field
and
not
merely
on
paper
but
i
am
speaking
only
of
the
habit
of
mind
required
for
study
of
that
inductive
habit
of
mind
which
works
steadily
and
by
rule
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
that
habit
of
mind
of
which
it
has
been
said
the
habit
of
seeing
the
habit
of
knowing
what
we
see
the
habit
of
discerning
differences
and
likenesses
the
habit
of
classifying
accordingly
the
habit
of
searching
for
hypotheses
which
shall
connect
and
explain
those
classified
facts
the
habit
of
verifying
these
hypotheses
by
applying
them
to
fresh
facts
the
habit
of
throwing
them
away
bravely
if
they
will
not
fit
the
habit
of
general
patience
diligence
accuracy
reverence
for
facts
for
their
own
sake
and
love
of
truth
for
its
own
sake
in
one
word
the
habit
of
reverent
and
implicit
obedience
to
the
laws
of
nature
whatever
they
may
be
these
are
not
merely
intellectual
but
also
moral
habits
which
will
stand
men
in
practical
good
stead
in
every
affair
of
life
and
in
every
question
even
the
most
awful
which
may
come
before
them
as
rational
and
social
beings
and
specially
valuable
are
they
surely
to
the
military
man
the
very
essence
of
whose
study
to
be
successful
lies
first
in
continuous
and
accurate
observation
and
then
in
calm
and
judicious
arrangement
therefore
it
is
that
i
hold
and
hold
strongly
that
the
study
of
physical
science
far
from
interfering
with
an
officer
studies
much
less
unfitting
for
them
must
assist
him
in
them
by
keeping
his
mind
always
in
the
very
attitude
and
the
very
temper
which
they
require
if
any
smile
at
this
theory
of
mine
let
them
recollect
one
curious
fact
that
perhaps
the
greatest
captain
of
the
old
world
was
trained
by
perhaps
the
greatest
philosopher
of
the
old
world
the
father
of
natural
history
that
aristotle
was
the
tutor
of
alexander
of
macedon
i
do
not
fancy
of
course
that
aristotle
taught
alexander
any
natural
history
but
this
we
know
that
he
taught
him
to
use
those
very
faculties
by
which
aristotle
became
a
natural
historian
and
many
things
beside
that
he
called
out
in
his
pupil
somewhat
of
his
own
extraordinary
powers
of
observation
extraordinary
powers
of
arrangement
he
helped
to
make
him
a
great
general
but
he
helped
to
make
him
more
a
great
politician
coloniser
discoverer
he
instilled
into
him
such
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
natural
history
that
alexander
helped
him
nobly
in
his
researches
and
if
athenaeus
is
to
be
believed
gave
him
talents
towards
perfecting
his
history
of
animals
surely
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
this
close
friendship
between
the
natural
philosopher
and
the
soldier
has
changed
the
whole
course
of
civilisation
to
this
very
day
do
not
consider
me
utopian
when
i
tell
you
that
i
should
like
to
see
the
study
of
physical
science
an
integral
part
of
the
curriculum
of
every
military
school
i
would
train
the
mind
of
the
lad
who
was
to
become
hereafter
an
officer
in
the
army
and
in
the
navy
like
wise
by
accustoming
him
to
careful
observation
of
and
sound
thought
about
the
face
of
nature
of
the
commonest
objects
under
his
feet
just
as
much
as
of
the
stars
above
his
head
provided
always
that
he
learnt
not
at
from
books
but
where
alone
he
can
really
learn
either
war
or
nature
in
the
field
by
actual
observation
actual
experiment
a
laboratory
for
chemical
experiment
is
a
good
thing
it
is
true
as
far
as
it
goes
but
i
should
prefer
to
the
laboratory
a
naturalists
field
club
such
as
are
prospering
now
at
several
of
the
best
public
schools
certain
that
the
boys
would
get
more
of
sound
inductive
habits
of
mind
as
well
as
more
health
manliness
and
cheerfulness
amid
scenes
to
remember
which
will
be
a
joy
for
ever
than
they
ever
can
by
bending
over
retorts
and
crucibles
amid
smells
even
to
remember
which
is
a
pain
for
ever
but
i
would
whether
a
field
club
existed
or
not
require
of
every
young
man
entering
the
army
or
navy
indeed
of
every
young
man
entering
any
liberal
profession
whatsoever
a
fair
knowledge
such
as
would
enable
him
to
pass
an
examination
in
what
the
germans
call
in
that
knowledge
of
the
face
of
the
earth
and
of
its
products
for
which
we
english
have
as
yet
cared
so
little
that
we
have
actually
no
english
name
for
it
save
the
clumsy
and
questionable
one
of
physical
geography
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
hardly
any
readable
school
books
about
it
save
keith
johnston
atlas
an
acquaintance
with
which
last
i
should
certainly
require
of
young
men
it
does
seem
most
strange
or
rather
will
seem
most
strange
years
hence
that
we
the
nation
of
colonists
the
nation
of
sailors
the
nation
of
foreign
commerce
the
nation
of
foreign
military
stations
the
nation
of
travellers
for
travelling
sake
the
nation
of
which
one
man
here
and
another
there
as
schleiden
sets
forth
in
his
book
plant
in
a
charming
ideal
conversation
at
the
travellers
club
has
seen
and
enjoyed
more
of
the
wonders
and
beauties
of
this
planet
than
the
men
of
any
nation
not
even
excepting
the
germans
that
this
nation
i
say
should
as
yet
have
done
nothing
or
all
but
nothing
to
teach
in
her
schools
a
knowledge
of
that
planet
of
which
she
needs
to
know
more
and
can
if
she
will
know
more
than
any
other
nation
upon
it
as
for
the
practical
utility
of
such
studies
to
a
soldier
i
only
need
i
trust
to
hint
at
it
to
such
an
assembly
as
this
all
must
see
of
what
advantage
a
rough
knowledge
of
the
botany
of
a
district
would
be
to
an
officer
leading
an
exploring
party
or
engaged
in
bush
warfare
to
know
what
plants
are
poisonous
what
plants
too
are
eatable
and
many
more
are
eatable
than
is
usually
supposed
what
plants
yield
oleaginous
substances
whether
for
food
or
for
other
uses
what
plants
yield
vegetable
acids
as
preventives
of
scurvy
what
timbers
are
available
for
each
of
many
different
purposes
what
will
resist
wet
and
the
attacks
of
insects
what
again
can
be
used
at
a
pinch
for
medicine
or
for
styptics
and
be
sure
as
a
wise
west
indian
doctor
once
said
to
me
that
there
is
more
good
medicine
wild
in
the
bush
than
there
is
in
all
the
druggists
shops
surely
all
this
is
a
knowledge
not
beneath
the
notice
of
any
enterprising
officer
above
all
of
an
officer
of
engineers
i
only
ask
anyone
who
thinks
that
i
may
be
in
the
right
to
glance
through
the
lists
of
useful
vegetable
products
given
in
lindley
kingdom
a
miracle
of
learning
and
see
the
vast
field
open
still
to
a
thoughtful
and
observant
man
even
while
on
service
and
not
to
forget
that
such
knowledge
if
he
should
hereafter
leave
the
service
and
settle
as
many
do
in
a
distant
land
may
be
a
solid
help
to
his
future
prosperity
so
strongly
do
i
feel
on
this
matter
that
i
should
like
to
see
some
knowledge
at
least
of
excellent
little
book
of
indian
botany
required
of
all
officers
going
to
our
indian
empire
but
as
that
will
not
be
at
least
for
many
a
year
to
come
i
recommend
any
gentlemen
going
to
india
to
get
that
book
and
wile
away
the
hours
of
the
outward
voyage
by
acquiring
knowledge
which
will
be
a
continual
source
of
interest
and
it
may
be
now
and
then
of
profit
to
them
during
their
stay
abroad
and
for
geology
again
as
i
do
not
expect
you
all
or
perhaps
any
of
you
to
become
such
botanists
as
general
monro
whose
recent
of
the
bamboos
is
an
honour
to
british
botanists
and
a
proof
of
the
scientific
power
which
is
to
be
found
here
and
there
among
british
officers
so
i
do
not
expect
you
to
become
such
geologists
as
sir
roderick
murchison
or
even
to
add
such
a
grand
chapter
to
the
history
of
extinct
animals
as
major
cautley
did
by
his
discoveries
in
the
sewalik
hills
nevertheless
you
can
learn
and
i
should
earnestly
advise
you
to
learn
geology
and
mineralogy
enough
to
be
of
great
use
to
you
in
your
profession
and
of
use
too
should
you
relinquish
your
profession
hereafter
it
must
be
profitable
for
any
man
and
specially
for
you
to
know
how
and
where
to
find
good
limestone
building
stone
road
metal
it
must
be
good
to
be
able
to
distinguish
ores
and
mineral
products
it
must
be
good
to
know
as
a
geologist
will
usually
know
even
in
a
country
which
he
sees
for
the
first
time
where
water
is
likely
to
be
found
and
at
what
probable
depth
it
must
be
good
to
know
whether
the
water
is
fit
for
drinking
or
not
whether
it
is
unwholesome
or
merely
muddy
it
must
be
good
to
know
what
spots
are
likely
to
be
healthy
and
what
unhealthy
for
encamping
the
two
last
questions
depend
doubtless
on
meteorological
as
well
as
geological
accidents
but
the
answers
to
them
will
be
most
surely
found
out
by
the
scientific
man
because
the
facts
connected
with
them
are
like
all
other
facts
determined
by
natural
laws
after
what
one
has
heard
in
past
years
of
barracks
built
in
spots
plainly
pestilential
of
soldiers
encamped
in
ruined
cities
reeking
with
the
dirt
and
poison
of
centuries
of
but
it
is
not
my
place
to
find
fault
all
i
will
say
is
that
the
wise
and
humane
officer
when
once
his
eyes
are
opened
to
the
practical
value
of
physical
science
will
surely
try
to
acquaint
himself
somewhat
with
those
laws
of
drainage
and
of
climate
geological
meteorological
chemical
which
influence
often
with
terrible
suddenness
and
fury
the
health
of
whole
armies
he
will
not
find
it
beyond
his
province
to
ascertain
the
amount
and
period
of
rainfalls
the
maxima
of
heat
and
of
cold
which
his
troops
may
have
to
endure
and
many
another
point
on
which
their
health
and
efficiency
nay
their
very
life
may
depend
but
which
are
now
too
exclusively
delegated
to
the
doctor
to
whose
province
they
do
not
really
belong
for
cure
i
take
the
liberty
of
believing
is
the
duty
of
the
medical
officer
prevention
that
of
the
military
thus
much
i
can
say
just
now
and
there
is
much
more
to
be
said
on
the
practical
uses
of
the
study
of
natural
history
but
let
me
remind
you
on
the
other
side
if
natural
history
will
help
you
you
in
return
can
help
her
and
would
i
doubt
not
help
her
and
help
scientific
men
at
home
if
once
you
looked
fairly
and
steadily
at
the
immense
importance
of
natural
history
of
the
knowledge
of
the
face
of
the
earth
i
believe
that
all
will
one
day
feel
more
or
less
that
to
know
the
earth
which
we
live
and
the
laws
of
it
which
we
live
is
a
sacred
duty
to
ourselves
to
our
children
after
us
and
to
all
whom
we
may
have
to
command
and
to
influence
aye
and
a
duty
to
god
likewise
for
is
it
not
a
duty
of
common
reverence
and
faith
towards
him
if
he
has
put
us
into
a
beautiful
and
wonderful
place
and
given
us
faculties
by
which
we
can
see
and
enjoy
and
use
that
place
is
it
not
a
duty
of
reverence
and
faith
towards
him
to
use
these
faculties
and
to
learn
the
lessons
which
he
has
laid
open
for
us
if
you
feel
that
as
i
think
you
all
will
some
day
feel
then
you
will
surely
feel
likewise
that
it
will
be
a
good
deed
i
do
not
say
a
necessary
duty
but
still
a
good
deed
and
praiseworthy
to
help
physical
science
forward
and
to
add
your
contributions
however
small
to
our
general
knowledge
of
the
earth
and
how
much
may
be
done
for
science
by
british
officers
especially
on
foreign
stations
i
need
not
point
out
i
know
that
much
has
been
done
chivalrously
and
well
by
officers
and
that
men
of
science
owe
them
and
give
them
hearty
thanks
for
their
labours
but
i
should
like
i
confess
to
see
more
done
still
i
should
like
to
see
every
foreign
station
what
one
or
two
officers
might
easily
make
it
an
advanced
post
of
physical
science
in
regular
communication
with
our
scientific
societies
at
home
sending
to
them
accurate
and
methodic
details
of
the
natural
history
of
each
district
details
of
which
might
seem
worthless
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
but
which
would
all
be
precious
in
the
eyes
of
scientific
men
who
know
that
no
fact
is
really
unimportant
and
more
that
while
plodding
patiently
through
seemingly
unimportant
facts
you
may
stumble
on
one
of
infinite
importance
both
scientific
and
practical
for
the
student
of
nature
gentlemen
if
he
will
be
but
patient
diligent
methodical
is
liable
at
any
moment
to
the
same
good
fortune
as
befel
saul
of
old
when
he
went
out
to
seek
his
father
asses
and
found
a
kingdom
there
are
those
lastly
who
have
neither
time
nor
taste
for
the
technicalities
and
nice
distinctions
of
formal
natural
history
who
enjoy
nature
but
as
artists
or
as
sportsmen
and
not
as
men
of
science
let
them
follow
their
bent
freely
but
let
them
not
suppose
that
in
following
it
they
can
do
nothing
towards
enlarging
our
knowledge
of
nature
especially
when
on
foreign
stations
so
far
from
it
drawings
ought
always
to
be
valuable
whether
of
plants
animals
or
scenery
provided
only
they
are
accurate
and
the
more
spirited
and
full
of
genius
they
are
the
more
accurate
they
are
certain
to
be
for
nature
being
alive
a
lifeless
copy
of
her
is
necessarily
an
untrue
copy
most
thankful
to
any
officer
for
a
mere
sight
of
sketches
will
be
the
closet
botanist
who
to
his
own
sorrow
knows
of
his
plants
only
from
dried
specimens
or
the
closet
zoologist
who
knows
his
animals
from
skins
and
bones
and
if
anyone
answers
but
i
can
not
draw
i
rejoin
you
can
at
least
photograph
if
a
young
officer
going
out
to
foreign
parts
and
knowing
nothing
at
all
about
physical
science
did
me
the
honour
to
ask
me
what
he
could
do
for
science
i
should
tell
him
learn
to
photograph
take
photographs
of
every
strange
bit
of
which
strikes
your
fancy
and
of
every
widely
extended
view
which
may
give
a
notion
of
the
general
lie
of
the
country
append
if
you
can
a
note
or
two
saying
whether
a
plain
is
rich
or
barren
whether
the
rock
is
sandstone
limestone
granitic
metamorphic
or
volcanic
lava
and
if
there
be
more
rocks
than
one
which
of
them
lies
on
the
other
and
send
them
to
be
exhibited
at
a
meeting
of
the
geological
society
i
doubt
not
that
the
learned
gentlemen
there
will
find
in
your
photographs
a
valuable
hint
or
two
for
which
they
will
be
much
obliged
i
learnt
for
instance
what
seemed
to
me
most
valuable
geological
lessons
from
mere
glances
at
drawings
i
believe
from
photographs
of
the
abyssinian
ranges
about
magdala
or
again
let
a
man
if
he
knows
nothing
of
botany
not
trouble
himself
with
collecting
and
drying
specimens
let
him
simply
photograph
every
strange
and
new
tree
or
plant
he
sees
to
give
a
general
notion
of
its
species
its
look
let
him
append
where
he
can
a
photograph
of
its
leafage
flower
fruit
and
send
them
to
hooker
or
any
distinguished
botanist
and
he
will
find
that
though
he
may
know
nothing
of
botany
he
will
have
pretty
certainly
increased
the
knowledge
of
those
who
do
know
the
sportsman
again
i
mean
the
sportsman
of
that
type
which
seems
peculiar
to
these
islands
who
loves
toil
and
danger
for
their
own
sakes
he
surely
is
a
naturalist
ipso
facto
though
he
knows
it
not
he
has
those
very
habits
of
keen
observation
on
which
all
sound
knowledge
of
nature
is
based
and
he
if
he
will
as
he
may
do
without
interfering
with
his
sport
can
study
the
habits
of
the
animals
among
whom
he
spends
wholesome
and
exciting
days
you
have
only
to
look
over
such
good
old
books
as
williams
sports
of
the
east
campbell
forest
ranger
lloyd
adventures
and
last
but
not
least
waterton
to
see
what
valuable
additions
to
true
zoology
the
knowledge
of
live
creatures
not
merely
dead
ones
british
sportsmen
have
made
and
still
can
make
and
as
for
the
employment
of
time
which
often
hangs
so
heavily
on
a
soldier
hands
really
i
am
ready
to
say
if
you
are
neither
men
of
science
nor
draughtsmen
nor
sportsmen
why
go
and
collect
beetles
it
is
not
very
dignified
i
know
nor
exciting
but
it
will
be
something
to
do
it
can
not
harm
you
if
you
take
as
do
an
sheet
to
lie
on
and
it
will
certainly
benefit
science
moreover
there
will
be
a
noble
humility
in
the
act
you
will
confess
to
the
public
that
you
consider
yourself
only
fit
to
catch
beetles
by
which
very
confession
you
will
prove
yourself
fit
for
much
finer
things
than
catching
beetles
and
meanwhile
as
i
said
before
you
will
be
at
least
out
of
harm
way
at
a
foreign
barrack
once
the
happiest
officer
i
met
because
the
most
regularly
employed
was
one
who
spent
his
time
in
collecting
butterflies
he
knew
nothing
about
them
scientifically
not
even
their
names
he
took
them
simply
for
their
wonderful
beauty
and
variety
and
in
the
hope
too
in
which
he
was
really
scientific
that
if
he
carefully
kept
every
form
which
he
saw
his
collection
might
be
of
use
some
day
to
entomologists
at
home
a
most
pleasant
gentleman
he
was
and
i
doubt
not
none
the
worse
soldier
for
his
butterfly
catching
commendable
also
in
my
eyes
was
another
officer
whom
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
who
on
a
remote
foreign
station
used
wisely
to
escape
from
the
temptations
of
the
world
into
an
entirely
original
and
most
pleasant
hermitage
for
finding
so
the
story
went
that
many
of
the
finest
insects
kept
to
the
and
never
came
to
ground
at
all
he
used
to
settle
himself
among
the
boughs
of
some
tree
in
the
tropic
forests
with
a
net
and
plenty
of
cigars
and
pass
his
hours
in
that
airy
flower
garden
making
dashes
every
now
and
then
at
some
splendid
monster
as
it
fluttered
round
his
head
his
example
need
not
be
followed
by
everyone
but
it
must
be
allowed
that
at
least
as
long
as
he
was
in
his
tree
he
was
neither
dawdling
grumbling
spending
money
nor
otherwise
harming
himself
and
perhaps
his
fellow
creatures
from
sheer
want
of
employment
one
word
more
and
i
have
done
if
i
was
allowed
to
give
one
special
piece
of
advice
to
a
young
officer
whether
of
the
army
or
navy
i
would
say
respect
scientific
men
associate
with
them
learn
from
them
find
them
to
be
as
you
will
usually
the
most
pleasant
and
instructive
of
companions
but
always
respect
them
allow
them
chivalrously
you
who
have
an
acknowledged
rank
their
yet
unacknowledged
rank
and
treat
them
as
all
the
world
will
treat
them
in
a
higher
and
truer
state
of
civilisation
they
do
not
yet
wear
the
queen
uniform
they
are
not
yet
accepted
servants
of
the
state
as
they
will
be
in
some
more
perfectly
organised
and
civilised
land
but
they
are
soldiers
nevertheless
and
good
soldiers
and
chivalrous
fighting
their
nation
battle
often
on
even
less
pay
than
you
and
with
still
less
chance
of
promotion
and
of
fame
against
most
real
and
fatal
enemies
against
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
this
planet
and
all
the
miseries
which
that
ignorance
begets
honour
them
for
their
work
sympathise
in
it
give
them
a
helping
hand
in
it
whenever
you
have
an
opportunity
and
what
opportunities
you
have
i
have
been
trying
to
sketch
for
you
and
more
work
at
it
yourselves
whenever
and
wherever
you
can
show
them
that
the
spirit
which
animates
them
the
hatred
of
ignorance
and
disorder
and
of
their
bestial
consequences
animates
you
likewise
show
them
that
the
habit
of
mind
which
they
value
in
themselves
the
habit
of
accurate
observation
and
careful
judgment
is
your
habit
likewise
show
them
that
you
value
science
not
merely
because
it
gives
better
weapons
of
destruction
and
of
defence
but
because
it
helps
you
to
become
able
to
take
a
just
and
accurate
view
of
any
subject
which
comes
before
you
and
to
cast
away
every
old
prejudice
and
every
hasty
judgment
in
the
face
of
truth
and
of
duty
and
it
will
be
better
for
you
and
for
them
but
why
what
need
for
the
soldier
and
the
man
of
science
to
fraternise
just
now
this
need
the
two
classes
which
will
have
an
increasing
it
may
be
a
preponderating
influence
on
the
fate
of
the
human
race
for
some
time
will
be
the
pupils
of
aristotle
and
those
of
alexander
the
men
of
science
and
the
soldiers
in
spite
of
all
appearances
and
all
declamations
to
the
contrary
that
is
my
firm
conviction
they
and
they
alone
will
be
left
to
rule
because
they
alone
each
in
his
own
sphere
have
learnt
to
obey
it
is
therefore
most
needful
for
the
welfare
of
society
that
they
should
pull
with
and
not
against
each
other
that
they
should
understand
each
other
respect
each
other
take
counsel
with
each
other
supplement
each
other
defects
bring
out
each
other
higher
tendencies
counteract
each
other
lower
ones
the
scientific
man
has
something
to
learn
of
you
gentlemen
which
i
doubt
not
that
he
will
learn
in
good
time
you
again
have
as
i
have
been
hinting
to
you
night
something
to
learn
of
him
which
you
i
doubt
not
will
learn
in
good
time
likewise
repeat
each
of
you
according
to
his
powers
the
old
friendship
between
aristotle
and
alexander
and
so
from
the
sympathy
and
of
you
two
a
class
of
thinkers
and
actors
may
yet
arise
which
can
save
this
nation
and
the
other
civilised
nations
of
the
world
from
that
of
which
i
had
rather
not
speak
and
wish
that
i
did
not
think
too
often
and
too
earnestly
i
may
be
a
dreamer
and
i
may
consider
in
my
turn
as
wilder
dreamers
than
myself
certain
persons
who
fancy
that
their
only
business
in
life
is
to
make
money
the
scientific
man
only
business
is
to
show
them
how
to
make
money
and
the
soldier
only
business
to
guard
their
money
for
them
be
that
as
it
may
the
finest
type
of
civilised
man
which
we
are
likely
to
see
for
some
generations
to
come
will
be
produced
by
a
combination
of
the
truly
military
with
the
truly
scientific
man
i
say
i
may
be
a
dreamer
but
you
at
least
as
well
as
my
scientific
friends
will
bear
with
me
for
my
dream
is
to
your
honour
on
an
address
given
to
the
scientific
society
of
winchester
i
am
not
sure
that
the
subject
of
my
address
is
rightly
chosen
i
am
not
sure
that
i
ought
not
to
have
postponed
a
question
of
mere
natural
history
to
speak
to
you
as
scientific
men
on
the
questions
of
life
and
death
which
have
been
forced
upon
us
by
the
awful
warning
of
an
illustrious
personage
illness
of
preventible
disease
its
frightful
prevalency
of
the
persons
who
are
said
to
have
died
of
fever
alone
since
the
prince
consort
death
ten
years
ago
of
the
remedies
of
drainage
of
sewage
disinfection
and
utilisation
and
of
the
assistance
which
you
as
a
body
of
scientific
men
can
give
to
any
effort
towards
saving
the
lives
and
health
of
our
from
those
unseen
poisons
which
lurk
like
wild
beasts
couched
in
the
jungle
ready
to
spring
at
any
moment
on
the
unsuspecting
the
innocent
the
helpless
of
all
this
i
longed
to
speak
but
i
thought
it
best
only
to
hint
at
it
and
leave
the
question
to
your
common
sense
and
your
humanity
taking
for
granted
that
your
minds
like
the
minds
of
all
englishmen
have
been
of
late
painfully
awakened
to
its
importance
it
seemed
to
me
almost
an
impertinence
to
say
more
in
a
city
of
whose
local
circumstances
i
know
little
or
nothing
as
an
old
sanitary
reformer
practical
as
well
as
theoretical
i
am
but
too
well
aware
of
the
difficulties
which
beset
any
complete
scheme
of
drainage
especially
in
an
ancient
city
like
this
where
men
are
paying
the
penalty
of
their
predecessors
ignorance
and
dwelling
whether
they
choose
or
not
over
fifteen
centuries
of
accumulated
dirt
and
therefore
taking
for
granted
that
there
is
energy
and
intellect
enough
in
winchester
to
conquer
these
difficulties
in
due
time
i
go
on
to
ask
you
to
consider
for
a
time
a
subject
which
is
growing
more
and
more
important
and
interesting
a
subject
the
study
of
which
will
do
much
towards
raising
the
field
naturalist
from
a
mere
collector
of
specimens
as
he
was
twenty
years
ago
to
a
philosopher
elucidating
some
of
the
grandest
problems
i
mean
the
infant
science
of
the
science
which
treats
of
the
distribution
of
plants
and
animals
over
the
globe
and
the
causes
of
that
distribution
i
doubt
not
that
there
are
many
here
who
know
far
more
about
the
subject
than
i
who
are
far
better
read
than
i
am
in
the
works
of
forbes
darwin
wallace
hooker
moritz
wagner
and
the
other
illustrious
men
who
have
written
on
it
but
i
may
perhaps
give
a
few
hints
which
will
be
of
use
to
the
younger
members
of
this
society
and
will
point
out
to
them
how
to
get
a
new
relish
for
the
pursuit
of
field
science
then
begins
with
asking
every
plant
or
animal
you
meet
large
or
small
not
merely
what
is
your
name
that
is
the
collector
and
classifier
duty
and
a
most
necessary
duty
it
is
and
one
to
be
performed
with
the
most
conscientious
patience
and
accuracy
so
that
a
sound
foundation
may
be
built
for
future
speculations
but
young
naturalists
should
act
not
merely
as
nature
registrars
and
but
as
her
policemen
and
gamekeepers
and
ask
everything
they
meet
how
did
you
get
here
by
what
road
did
you
come
what
was
your
last
place
of
abode
and
now
you
are
here
how
do
you
get
your
living
are
you
and
your
children
thriving
like
decent
people
who
can
take
care
of
themselves
or
growing
pauperised
and
degraded
and
dying
out
not
that
we
have
a
fear
of
your
becoming
a
dangerous
class
madam
nature
allows
no
dangerous
classes
in
the
modern
sense
she
has
doubtless
for
some
wise
reason
no
mercy
for
the
weak
she
rewards
each
organism
according
to
its
works
and
if
anything
grows
too
weak
or
stupid
to
take
care
of
itself
she
gives
it
its
due
deserts
by
letting
it
die
and
disappear
so
you
plant
or
you
animal
are
you
among
the
strong
the
successful
the
multiplying
the
colonising
or
are
you
among
the
weak
the
failing
the
dwindling
the
doomed
these
questions
may
seem
somewhat
rude
but
you
may
comfort
yourself
by
the
thought
that
plants
and
animals
though
they
deserve
all
kindness
all
admiration
deserve
no
courtesy
at
least
in
this
respect
for
they
are
one
and
all
wherever
you
find
them
vagrants
and
landloupers
intruders
and
conquerors
who
have
got
where
they
happen
to
be
simply
by
the
law
of
the
strongest
generally
not
without
a
little
robbery
and
murder
they
have
no
right
save
that
of
possession
the
same
by
which
the
puffin
turns
out
the
old
rabbits
eats
the
young
ones
and
then
lays
her
eggs
in
the
rabbit
burrow
simply
because
she
can
now
you
will
see
at
once
that
such
a
course
of
questioning
will
call
out
a
great
many
curious
and
interesting
answers
if
you
can
only
get
the
things
to
tell
you
their
story
as
you
always
may
if
you
will
them
long
enough
and
will
lead
you
into
many
subjects
beside
mere
botany
or
entomology
so
various
indeed
are
the
subjects
which
you
will
thus
start
that
i
can
only
hint
at
them
now
in
the
most
cursory
fashion
at
the
outset
you
will
soon
find
yourself
involved
in
chemical
and
meteorological
questions
as
for
instance
when
you
ask
how
is
it
that
i
find
one
flora
on
the
another
on
the
sandstone
another
on
the
chalk
and
another
on
the
gravelly
strata
the
usual
answer
would
be
i
presume
if
we
could
work
it
out
by
twenty
experiment
such
as
lawes
of
rothampsted
has
been
making
on
the
growth
of
grasses
and
leguminous
plants
in
different
soils
and
under
different
manures
the
usual
answer
i
say
would
be
because
we
plants
want
such
and
such
mineral
constituents
in
our
woody
fibre
again
because
we
want
a
certain
amount
of
moisture
at
a
certain
period
of
the
year
or
perhaps
simply
because
the
mechanical
arrangement
of
the
particles
of
a
certain
soil
happens
to
suit
the
shape
of
our
roots
and
of
their
stomata
sometimes
you
will
get
an
answer
quickly
enough
sometimes
not
if
you
ask
for
instance
how
it
contrives
to
grow
plentifully
in
the
craven
of
yorkshire
down
to
or
feet
above
the
sea
while
in
snowdon
it
dislikes
growing
lower
than
feet
and
is
not
plentiful
even
there
it
will
reply
because
in
the
craven
i
can
get
as
much
carbonic
acid
as
i
want
from
the
decomposing
limestone
while
on
the
snowdon
silurian
i
get
very
little
and
i
have
to
make
it
up
by
clinging
to
the
mountain
tops
for
the
sake
of
the
greater
rainfall
but
if
you
ask
how
is
it
you
choose
only
to
grow
on
limestone
while
of
which
i
suspect
you
are
only
a
variety
is
ready
to
grow
anywhere
will
refuse
as
yet
to
answer
a
word
again
i
can
only
give
you
the
merest
string
of
hints
you
will
find
in
your
questionings
that
many
plants
and
animals
have
no
reason
at
all
to
show
why
they
should
be
in
one
place
and
not
in
another
save
the
very
sound
reason
for
the
latter
which
was
suggested
to
me
once
by
a
great
naturalist
i
was
asking
why
do
i
find
such
and
such
a
species
in
my
parish
while
it
is
plentiful
a
few
miles
off
in
exactly
the
same
soil
and
he
answered
for
the
same
reason
that
you
are
not
in
america
because
you
have
not
got
there
which
answer
threw
to
me
a
flood
of
light
on
this
whole
science
things
are
often
where
they
are
simply
because
they
happen
to
have
got
there
and
not
elsewhere
but
they
must
have
got
there
by
some
means
and
those
means
i
want
young
naturalists
to
discover
at
least
to
guess
at
a
species
for
instance
and
i
suspect
it
is
a
common
case
with
insects
may
abound
in
a
single
spot
simply
because
long
years
ago
a
single
brood
of
eggs
happened
to
hatch
at
a
time
when
eggs
of
other
species
who
would
have
competed
against
them
for
food
did
not
hatch
and
they
may
remain
confined
to
that
spot
though
there
is
plenty
of
good
food
for
them
outside
it
simply
because
they
do
not
increase
fast
enough
to
require
to
spread
out
in
search
of
more
food
thus
i
should
explain
a
case
which
i
heard
of
lately
of
abundant
for
years
in
one
corner
of
a
certain
field
and
only
there
while
there
was
just
as
much
trefoil
all
round
for
its
larvae
as
there
was
in
the
selected
spot
i
can
i
say
only
give
hints
but
they
will
suffice
i
hope
to
show
the
path
of
thought
into
which
i
want
young
naturalists
to
turn
their
minds
or
again
you
will
have
to
inquire
whether
the
species
has
not
been
prevented
from
spreading
by
some
natural
barrier
wallace
whom
you
all
of
course
know
has
shown
in
his
archipelago
that
a
strait
of
deep
sea
can
act
as
such
a
barrier
between
species
moritz
wagner
has
shown
that
in
the
case
of
insects
a
moderately
broad
river
may
divide
two
closely
allied
species
of
beetles
or
a
very
narrow
two
closely
allied
species
of
moths
again
another
cause
and
a
most
common
one
is
that
the
plants
can
not
spread
because
they
find
the
ground
beyond
them
already
occupied
by
other
plants
who
will
not
tolerate
a
fresh
mouth
having
only
just
enough
to
feed
themselves
take
the
case
of
and
london
pride
they
are
two
especially
strong
species
they
show
that
especially
by
their
power
of
sporting
of
diverging
into
varieties
they
show
it
equally
by
their
power
of
thriving
anywhere
if
they
can
only
get
there
they
will
both
grow
in
my
sandy
garden
under
a
rainfall
of
only
inches
more
luxuriantly
than
in
their
native
mountains
under
a
rainfall
of
or
inches
then
how
is
it
that
can
not
get
down
off
the
mountains
and
that
though
in
kerry
it
has
got
off
the
mountains
and
down
to
the
sea
level
exterminating
i
suspect
many
species
in
its
progress
yet
can
not
get
across
county
cork
the
only
answer
is
i
believe
that
both
species
are
continually
trying
to
go
ahead
but
that
the
other
plants
already
in
front
of
them
are
too
strong
for
them
and
massacre
their
infants
as
soon
as
born
and
this
brings
us
to
another
curious
question
the
sudden
and
abundant
appearance
of
plants
like
the
foxglove
and
in
spots
where
they
have
never
been
seen
before
are
their
seeds
as
some
think
dormant
in
the
ground
or
are
the
seeds
which
have
germinated
fresh
ones
wafted
thither
by
wind
or
otherwise
and
only
able
to
germinate
in
that
one
spot
because
there
the
soil
is
clear
general
monro
now
famous
for
his
unequalled
memoir
on
the
bamboos
holds
to
the
latter
theory
he
pointed
out
to
me
that
the
seeds
being
feathered
could
travel
with
the
wind
that
the
plant
always
made
its
appearance
first
on
new
banks
landslips
clearings
where
it
had
nothing
to
compete
against
and
that
the
foxglove
did
the
same
true
and
most
painfully
true
in
the
case
of
thistles
and
groundsels
but
foxglove
seeds
though
minute
would
hardly
be
carried
by
the
wind
any
more
than
those
of
the
white
clover
which
comes
up
so
abundantly
in
drained
fens
adhuc
sub
judice
lis
est
and
i
wish
some
young
naturalists
would
work
carefully
at
the
solution
by
experiment
which
is
the
most
sure
way
to
find
out
anything
but
in
researches
in
this
direction
they
will
find
puzzles
enough
i
will
give
them
one
which
i
shall
be
most
thankful
to
hear
they
have
solved
within
the
next
seven
years
how
is
it
that
we
find
certain
plants
namely
the
thrift
and
the
scurvy
grass
abundant
on
the
and
common
on
certain
but
nowhere
between
the
two
answer
me
that
for
i
have
looked
at
the
fact
for
years
before
behind
sideways
upside
down
and
inside
out
and
i
can
not
understand
it
but
all
these
questions
and
specially
i
suspect
that
last
one
ought
to
lead
the
young
student
up
to
the
great
and
complex
question
how
were
these
islands
with
plants
and
animals
after
the
long
and
wholesale
catastrophe
of
the
glacial
epoch
i
presume
you
all
know
and
will
agree
that
the
whole
of
these
islands
north
of
the
thames
save
certain
were
buried
for
long
ages
under
an
icy
sea
from
whence
did
vegetable
and
animal
life
crawl
back
to
the
land
as
it
rose
again
and
cover
its
mantle
of
glacial
drift
with
fresh
life
and
verdure
now
let
me
give
you
a
few
prolegomena
on
this
matter
you
must
study
the
plants
of
course
species
by
species
take
watson
britannica
and
moore
hibernica
and
let
as
matthew
arnold
would
say
your
thought
play
freely
about
them
look
carefully
too
in
the
case
of
each
species
at
the
note
on
its
distribution
which
you
will
find
appended
in
bentham
and
in
hooker
flora
get
all
the
help
you
can
if
you
wish
to
work
the
subject
out
from
foreign
botanists
both
european
and
american
and
i
think
that
on
the
whole
you
will
come
to
some
such
theory
as
this
for
a
general
starting
platform
we
do
not
owe
our
flora
i
must
keep
to
the
flora
just
now
to
so
many
different
regions
or
types
as
watson
conceives
but
to
three
namely
an
european
or
germanic
flora
from
the
an
atlantic
flora
from
the
a
northern
flora
from
the
north
these
three
invaded
us
after
the
glacial
epoch
and
our
general
flora
is
their
result
but
this
will
cause
you
much
trouble
before
you
go
a
step
further
you
will
have
to
eliminate
from
all
your
calculations
most
of
the
plants
which
watson
calls
glareal
found
in
cultivated
ground
about
habitations
and
what
their
limit
may
be
i
think
we
never
shall
know
but
of
this
we
may
be
sure
that
just
as
invading
armies
always
bring
with
them
in
forage
or
otherwise
some
plants
from
their
own
country
just
as
the
cossacks
in
brought
more
than
one
russian
plant
through
germany
into
france
just
as
you
have
already
a
crop
of
north
german
plants
upon
the
of
france
thus
do
conquering
races
bring
new
plants
the
romans
during
their
or
years
of
occupation
and
civilisation
must
have
brought
more
species
i
believe
than
i
dare
mention
i
suspect
them
of
having
brought
not
merely
the
common
hedge
elm
of
the
south
not
merely
the
three
species
of
nettle
but
all
our
red
poppies
and
a
great
number
of
the
weeds
which
are
common
in
our
cornfields
and
when
we
add
to
them
the
plants
which
may
have
been
brought
by
returning
crusaders
and
pilgrims
by
monks
from
every
part
of
europe
by
flemings
or
other
dealers
in
foreign
wool
we
have
to
cut
a
huge
cantle
out
of
our
indigenous
flora
only
having
no
records
we
hardly
know
where
and
what
to
cut
out
and
can
only
we
elder
ones
recommend
the
subject
to
the
notice
of
the
younger
botanists
that
they
may
work
it
out
after
our
work
is
done
of
course
these
plants
introduced
by
man
if
they
are
cut
out
must
be
cut
out
of
only
one
of
the
floras
namely
the
european
for
they
probably
came
from
the
by
whatever
means
they
came
that
european
flora
invaded
us
i
presume
immediately
after
the
glacial
epoch
at
a
time
when
france
and
england
were
united
and
the
german
ocean
a
mere
network
of
rivers
which
emptied
into
the
deep
sea
between
scotland
and
scandinavia
and
here
i
must
add
that
endless
questions
of
interest
will
arise
to
those
who
will
study
not
merely
the
invasion
of
that
truly
european
flora
but
the
invasion
of
reptiles
insects
and
birds
especially
birds
of
passage
which
must
have
followed
it
as
soon
as
the
land
was
sufficiently
covered
with
vegetation
to
support
life
whole
volumes
remain
to
be
written
on
this
subject
i
trust
that
some
of
your
younger
members
may
live
to
write
one
of
them
the
way
to
begin
will
be
to
compare
the
flora
and
fauna
of
this
part
of
england
very
carefully
with
that
of
the
southern
and
eastern
counties
and
then
to
compare
them
again
with
the
fauna
and
flora
of
france
belgium
and
holland
as
for
the
atlantic
flora
you
will
have
to
decide
for
yourselves
whether
you
accept
or
not
the
theory
of
a
sunken
atlantic
continent
i
confess
that
all
objections
to
that
theory
however
astounding
it
may
seem
are
outweighed
in
my
mind
by
a
host
of
facts
which
i
can
explain
by
no
other
theory
but
you
must
judge
for
yourselves
and
to
do
so
you
must
study
carefully
the
distribution
of
heaths
both
in
europe
and
at
the
cape
and
their
beyond
the
ural
mountains
and
in
america
save
in
labrador
where
the
common
ling
an
older
and
less
specialised
form
exists
you
must
consider
too
the
plants
common
to
the
azores
portugal
the
west
of
england
ireland
and
the
western
hebrides
in
so
doing
young
naturalists
will
at
least
find
proofs
of
a
change
in
the
distribution
of
land
and
water
which
will
utterly
astound
them
when
they
face
it
for
the
first
time
as
for
the
northern
flora
the
question
whence
it
came
is
puzzling
enough
it
seems
difficult
to
conceive
how
any
plants
could
have
survived
when
scotland
was
an
archipelago
in
the
same
condition
as
greenland
is
now
and
we
have
no
proof
that
there
existed
after
the
glacial
epoch
any
northern
continent
from
which
the
plants
and
animals
could
have
come
back
to
us
the
species
of
plants
and
animals
common
to
britain
scandinavia
and
north
america
must
have
spread
in
times
when
a
continent
joining
them
did
exist
but
some
light
has
been
thrown
on
this
question
by
an
article
as
charming
as
it
is
able
on
the
physics
of
the
arctic
ice
by
brown
of
campster
you
will
find
it
in
the
journal
of
the
geological
society
for
february
he
shows
there
that
even
in
greenland
peaks
and
crags
are
left
free
enough
from
ice
to
support
a
vegetation
of
between
or
species
of
flowering
plants
and
therefore
he
well
says
we
must
be
careful
to
avoid
concluding
that
the
plant
and
animal
life
on
the
dreary
shores
or
of
the
old
glacial
scotland
was
poor
the
same
would
hold
good
of
our
mountains
and
if
so
we
may
look
with
respect
even
with
awe
on
the
alpine
plants
of
wales
scotland
and
the
lake
mountains
as
organisms
stunted
it
may
be
and
even
degraded
by
their
long
battle
with
the
elements
but
venerable
from
their
age
historic
from
their
endurance
relics
of
an
older
temperate
world
they
have
lived
through
thousands
of
centuries
of
frost
and
fog
to
sun
themselves
in
a
temperate
climate
once
more
i
can
never
pick
one
of
them
without
a
tinge
of
shame
and
to
exterminate
one
of
them
is
to
destroy
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
collecting
the
last
of
a
family
which
god
has
taken
the
trouble
to
preserve
for
thousands
of
centuries
i
trust
that
these
hints
for
i
can
call
them
nothing
more
will
at
least
awaken
any
young
naturalist
who
has
hitherto
only
collected
natural
objects
to
study
the
really
important
and
interesting
question
how
did
these
things
get
here
now
hence
arise
questions
which
may
puzzle
the
mind
of
a
hampshire
naturalist
you
have
in
this
neighbourhood
as
you
well
know
two
or
rather
three
soils
each
carrying
its
peculiar
vegetation
first
you
have
the
clay
lying
on
the
chalk
and
carrying
vast
woodlands
seemingly
primeval
next
you
have
the
chalk
with
its
peculiar
delicate
and
often
fragrant
crop
of
plants
and
next
you
have
the
poor
sands
and
clays
of
the
new
forest
basin
saturated
with
iron
and
therefore
carrying
a
moorland
or
vegetation
in
many
respects
quite
different
from
the
others
and
this
moorland
soil
and
this
vegetation
with
a
few
singular
exceptions
repeats
itself
as
i
daresay
you
know
in
the
north
of
the
county
in
the
bagshot
basin
as
it
is
called
the
moors
of
aldershot
hartford
bridge
and
windsor
forest
now
what
a
variety
of
interesting
questions
are
opened
up
by
these
simple
facts
how
did
these
three
floras
get
each
to
its
present
place
where
did
each
come
from
how
did
it
get
past
or
through
the
other
till
each
set
of
plants
after
long
internecine
competition
settled
itself
down
in
the
sheet
of
land
most
congenial
to
it
and
when
did
each
come
hither
which
is
the
oldest
will
any
one
tell
me
whether
the
heathy
flora
of
the
moors
or
the
thymy
flora
of
the
chalk
downs
were
the
earlier
inhabitants
of
these
isles
to
these
questions
i
can
not
get
any
answer
and
they
can
not
be
answered
without
first
a
very
careful
study
of
the
range
of
each
species
of
plant
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
next
without
careful
study
of
those
stupendous
changes
in
the
shape
of
this
island
which
have
taken
place
at
a
very
late
geological
epoch
the
composition
of
the
flora
of
our
moorlands
is
as
yet
to
me
an
utter
puzzle
we
have
lycopodiums
three
species
enormously
ancient
forms
which
have
survived
the
age
of
ice
but
did
they
crawl
downward
hither
from
the
northern
mountains
or
upward
hither
from
the
pyrenees
we
have
the
beautiful
bog
asphodel
again
an
enormously
ancient
form
for
it
is
strange
to
say
common
to
north
america
and
to
northern
europe
but
does
not
enter
asia
almost
an
unique
instance
it
must
surely
have
come
from
the
north
and
points
as
do
many
species
of
plants
and
animals
to
the
time
when
north
europe
and
north
america
were
joined
we
have
sparingly
in
north
hampshire
though
strangely
not
on
the
bagshot
moors
the
common
or
northern
butterwort
and
also
in
the
south
the
new
forest
part
of
the
county
the
delicate
little
the
only
species
now
found
in
devon
and
cornwall
marking
the
new
forest
as
the
extreme
eastern
limit
of
the
atlantic
flora
we
have
again
the
heaths
which
as
i
have
just
said
are
found
neither
in
america
nor
in
asia
and
must
i
believe
have
come
from
some
land
long
since
submerged
beneath
the
sea
but
more
we
have
in
the
new
forest
two
plants
which
are
members
of
the
south
europe
or
properly
the
atlantic
flora
which
must
have
come
from
the
south
and
and
which
are
found
in
no
other
spots
in
these
islands
i
mean
the
lovely
which
grows
abundantly
under
the
ferns
near
lyndhurst
certainly
wild
but
it
does
not
approach
england
elsewhere
nearer
than
the
loire
and
the
rhine
and
next
that
delicate
orchid
the
which
is
known
only
in
a
bog
near
lyndhurst
and
in
the
channel
islands
while
on
the
continent
it
extends
from
southern
europe
all
through
france
now
what
do
these
two
plants
mark
they
give
us
a
point
in
botany
though
not
in
time
to
determine
when
the
south
of
england
was
parted
from
the
opposite
shores
of
france
and
whenever
that
was
it
was
just
after
the
gladiolus
and
spiranthes
got
hither
two
little
colonies
of
these
lovely
flowers
arrived
just
before
their
retreat
was
cut
off
they
found
the
country
already
occupied
with
other
plants
and
not
being
reinforced
by
fresh
colonists
from
the
south
have
not
been
able
to
spread
farther
north
than
lyndhurst
thus
in
the
new
forest
and
i
may
say
in
the
bagshot
moors
you
find
plants
which
you
do
not
expect
and
do
not
find
plants
which
you
do
expect
and
you
are
or
ought
to
be
puzzled
and
i
hope
also
interested
and
stirred
up
to
find
out
more
i
spoke
just
now
of
the
time
when
england
was
joined
to
france
as
bearing
on
hampshire
botany
it
bears
no
less
on
hampshire
zoology
in
insects
for
instance
the
presence
of
the
purple
emperor
and
the
white
admiral
in
our
hampshire
woods
as
well
as
the
abundance
of
the
great
point
to
a
time
when
the
two
countries
were
joined
at
least
as
far
west
as
hampshire
while
the
absence
of
these
insects
farther
to
the
westward
shows
that
the
countries
if
ever
joined
were
already
parted
and
that
those
insects
have
not
yet
had
time
to
spread
westward
the
presence
of
these
two
butterflies
and
partly
of
the
beetle
along
the
coast
of
england
as
far
as
the
primeval
forests
of
south
lincolnshire
points
as
do
a
hundred
other
facts
to
a
time
when
the
straits
of
dover
either
did
not
exist
or
were
the
bed
of
a
river
running
from
the
west
and
when
as
i
told
you
just
now
all
the
rivers
which
now
run
into
the
german
ocean
from
the
humber
on
the
west
to
the
elbe
on
the
east
discharged
themselves
into
the
sea
between
scotland
and
norway
after
wandering
through
a
vast
lowland
covered
with
countless
herds
of
mammoth
rhinoceros
gigantic
ox
and
other
mammals
now
extinct
while
the
birds
as
far
as
we
know
the
insects
the
water
fish
and
even
as
my
friend
brady
has
proved
the
of
the
rivers
were
the
same
in
what
is
now
holland
as
in
what
is
now
our
eastern
counties
i
could
dwell
long
on
this
matter
i
could
talk
long
about
how
certain
species
of
moths
and
butterflies
like
and
swarm
through
france
reach
up
to
the
british
channel
and
have
not
crossed
it
with
the
exception
of
one
colony
of
in
the
cambridgeshire
fens
i
could
talk
long
about
a
similar
phenomenon
in
the
case
of
our
migratory
and
singing
birds
how
many
exquisite
species
notably
those
two
glorious
songsters
the
orphean
warbler
and
hippolais
which
delight
our
ears
everywhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
follow
our
nightingales
blackcaps
and
warblers
northward
every
spring
almost
to
the
straits
of
dover
but
dare
not
cross
simply
because
they
have
been
as
it
were
created
since
the
gulf
was
opened
and
have
never
learnt
from
their
parents
how
to
fly
over
it
in
the
case
of
fishes
again
i
might
say
much
on
the
curious
fact
that
the
cyprinidae
or
white
fish
carp
and
their
natural
enemy
the
pike
are
indigenous
i
believe
only
to
the
rivers
english
or
continental
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
straits
of
dover
while
the
rivers
on
the
western
side
were
originally
tenanted
like
our
hampshire
streams
as
now
almost
entirely
by
trout
their
only
cyprinoid
being
the
minnow
if
it
too
be
not
an
interloper
and
i
might
ask
you
to
consider
the
bearing
of
this
curious
fact
on
the
former
junction
of
england
and
france
but
i
have
only
time
to
point
out
to
you
a
few
curious
facts
with
regard
to
reptiles
which
should
be
specially
interesting
to
a
hampshire
geologist
you
know
of
course
that
in
ireland
there
are
no
reptiles
save
the
little
common
lizard
and
a
few
frogs
on
the
how
they
got
there
i
can
not
conceive
and
you
will
of
course
guess
and
rightly
that
the
reason
of
the
absence
of
reptiles
is
that
ireland
was
parted
off
from
england
before
the
creatures
which
certainly
spread
from
southern
and
warmer
climates
had
time
to
get
there
you
know
of
course
that
we
have
a
few
reptiles
in
england
but
you
may
not
be
aware
that
as
soon
as
you
cross
the
channel
you
find
many
more
species
of
reptiles
than
here
as
well
as
those
which
you
find
here
the
magnificent
green
lizard
which
rattles
about
like
a
rabbit
in
a
french
forest
is
never
found
here
simply
because
it
had
not
worked
northward
till
after
the
channel
was
formed
but
there
are
three
reptiles
peculiar
to
this
part
of
england
which
should
be
most
interesting
to
a
hampshire
zoologist
the
one
is
the
sand
lizard
found
on
and
i
suspect
in
the
south
hampshire
moors
likewise
a
north
european
and
french
species
another
the
a
harmless
french
and
austrian
snake
which
has
been
found
about
me
in
north
hants
and
south
berks
now
about
fifteen
or
twenty
times
i
have
had
three
specimens
from
my
own
parish
i
believe
it
not
to
be
uncommon
and
most
probably
to
be
found
by
those
who
will
look
both
in
the
new
forest
and
woolmer
the
third
is
the
natterjack
or
running
toad
a
most
beautifully
spotted
animal
with
a
yellow
stripe
down
his
back
which
is
common
with
me
at
eversley
and
common
also
in
many
moorlands
of
hants
and
surrey
and
according
to
fleming
on
heaths
near
london
and
as
far
as
lincolnshire
in
which
case
it
will
belong
to
the
germanic
fauna
now
here
again
we
have
cases
of
animals
which
have
just
been
able
to
get
hither
before
the
severance
of
england
and
france
and
which
not
being
reinforced
from
the
rear
have
been
forced
to
stop
in
small
and
probably
decreasing
colonies
on
the
spots
nearest
the
coast
which
were
fit
for
them
i
trust
that
i
have
not
kept
you
too
long
over
these
details
what
i
wish
to
impress
upon
you
is
that
hampshire
is
a
county
specially
fitted
for
the
study
of
important
questions
to
work
them
out
you
must
trace
the
geology
of
hampshire
and
indeed
of
east
dorset
you
must
try
to
form
a
conception
of
how
the
land
was
shaped
in
miocene
times
before
that
tremendous
upheaval
which
reared
the
chalk
cliffs
at
freshwater
upright
lifting
the
tertiary
beds
upon
their
northern
slopes
you
must
ask
was
there
not
land
to
the
south
of
the
isle
of
wight
in
those
ages
and
for
ages
after
and
what
was
its
extent
and
shape
you
must
ask
when
was
the
gap
between
the
isle
of
wight
and
the
isle
of
purbeck
sawn
through
leaving
the
needles
as
remnants
on
one
side
and
old
harry
on
the
opposite
and
was
it
sawn
asunder
merely
by
the
gnawing
of
the
waves
you
must
ask
where
did
the
great
river
which
ran
from
the
west
where
poole
harbour
is
now
and
probably
through
what
is
now
the
solent
depositing
brackish
right
and
left
where
i
say
did
it
run
into
the
sea
where
the
straits
of
dover
are
now
or
if
not
there
where
what
too
is
become
of
the
land
to
the
westward
composed
of
ancient
metamorphic
rocks
out
of
which
it
ran
and
deposited
on
what
are
now
the
haggerstone
moors
of
poole
vast
beds
of
grit
what
was
the
climate
on
its
banks
when
it
washed
down
the
delicate
leaves
of
trees
akin
to
our
modern
english
ones
which
are
found
in
the
fine
strata
of
bournemouth
when
finally
did
it
dwindle
down
to
the
brook
which
now
runs
through
wareham
town
was
its

ages
of

and
if
you
say
who
is
sufficient
for
these
things
who
can
answer

answer

you
or
your

you

shall
i

shall
i
be
the

my
friends
whether
you
will
be
the
happier
for
it
or
for
any
knowledge
of
physical
science
or
for
any
other
knowledge
whatsoever
i
can
not
tell
that
lies
in
the
decision
of
a
higher
power
than
i
and
indeed
to
speak
honestly
i
do
not
think
that
or
any
other
branch
of
physical
science
is
likely
at
first
at
least
to
make
you
happy
neither
is
the
study
of
your
neither
is
religion
itself
we
were
not
sent
into
the
world
to
be
happy
but
to
be
right
at
least
poor
creatures
that
we
are
as
right
as
we
can
be
and
we
must
be
content
with
being
right
and
not
happy
for
i
fear
or
rather
i
hope
that
most
of
us
are
not
capable
of
carrying
out
talleyrand
recipe
for
perfect
happiness
on
earth
namely
a
hard
heart
and
a
good
digestion
therefore
as
our
hearts
are
happily
not
always
hard
and
our
digestions
unhappily
not
always
good
we
will
be
content
to
be
made
wise
by
physical
science
even
though
we
be
not
made
happy
and
we
shall
be
made
truly
wise
if
we
be
made
content
content
too
not
only
with
what
we
can
understand
but
content
with
what
we
do
not
understand
the
habit
of
mind
which
theologians
call
and
rightly
faith
in
god
the
true
and
solid
faith
which
comes
often
out
of
sadness
and
out
of
doubt
such
as
may
well
stir
in
us
at
first
sight
for
our
first
feeling
will
be
i
know
mine
was
when
i
began
to
look
into
these
matters
one
somewhat
of
dread
and
of
horror
here
were
all
these
creatures
animal
and
vegetable
competing
against
each
other
and
their
competition
was
so
earnest
and
complete
that
it
did
not
mean
as
it
does
among
honest
shopkeepers
in
a
civilised
country
i
will
make
a
little
more
money
than
you
but
i
will
crush
you
enslave
you
exterminate
you
eat
you
up
woe
to
the
weak
seems
to
be
nature
watchword
the
psalmist
says
the
righteous
shall
inherit
the
land
if
you
go
to
a
tropical
forest
or
indeed
if
you
observe
carefully
a
square
acre
of
any
english
land
cultivated
or
uncultivated
you
will
find
that
nature
text
at
first
sight
looks
a
very
different
one
she
seems
to
say
not
the
righteous
but
the
strong
shall
inherit
the
land
plant
insect
bird
what
not
find
a
weaker
plant
insect
bird
than
yourself
and
kill
it
and
take
possession
of
its
little
vineyard
and
no
naboth
curse
shall
follow
you
but
you
shall
inherit
and
thrive
therein
you
and
your
children
after
you
if
they
will
be
only
as
strong
and
as
cruel
as
you
are
that
is
nature
law
and
is
it
not
at
first
sight
a
fearful
law
internecine
competition
ruthless
selfishness
so
internecine
and
so
ruthless
that
as
i
have
wandered
in
tropic
forests
where
this
temper
is
shown
more
quickly
and
fiercely
though
not
in
the
least
more
evilly
than
in
our
slow
and
cold
temperate
one
i
have
said
really
these
trees
and
plants
are
as
wicked
as
so
many
human
beings
throughout
the
great
republic
of
the
organic
world
the
motto
of
the
majority
is
and
always
has
been
as
far
back
as
we
can
see
what
it
is
and
always
has
been
with
the
majority
of
human
beings
every
one
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
tyranny
the
temper
which
fawns
and
clings
and
plays
the
parasite
as
long
as
it
is
down
and
when
it
has
risen
fattens
on
its
patron
blood
and
life
these
and
the
other
works
of
the
flesh
are
the
works
of
average
plants
and
animals
as
far
as
they
can
practise
them
at
least
so
says
at
first
sight
the
science
of
till
the
naturalist
if
he
be
also
human
and
humane
is
glad
to
escape
from
the
confusion
and
darkness
of
the
universal
of
selfishness
into
the
order
and
light
of
for
then
there
comes
to
him
the
thought
and
are
these
all
the
facts
and
is
this
all
which
the
facts
mean
that
mutual
competition
is
one
law
of
nature
we
see
too
plainly
but
is
there
not
besides
that
law
a
law
of
mutual
help
true
it
is
as
the
wise
man
has
said
that
the
very
hyssop
on
the
wall
grows
there
because
all
the
forces
of
the
universe
could
not
prevent
its
growing
all
honour
to
the
hyssop
a
brave
plant
it
has
fought
a
brave
fight
and
has
its
just
deserts
as
everything
in
nature
has
and
so
has
won
but
did
all
the
powers
of
the
universe
combine
to
prevent
it
growing
is
not
that
a
statement
of
facts
did
not
all
the
powers
of
the
universe
also
combine
to
make
it
grow
if
only
it
had
valour
and
worth
wherewith
to
grow
did
not
the
rains
feed
it
the
very
mortar
in
the
wall
give
lime
to
its
roots
were
not
electricity
gravitation
and
i
know
not
what
of
chemical
and
mechanical
forces
busy
about
the
little
plant
and
every
cell
of
it
kindly
and
patiently
ready
to
help
it
if
it
would
only
help
itself
surely
this
is
true
true
of
every
organic
thing
animal
and
vegetable
and
mineral
too
for
aught
i
know
and
so
we
must
soften
our
sadness
at
the
sight
of
the
universal
mutual
war
by
the
sight
of
an
equally
universal
mutual
help
but
more
it
is
true
too
true
if
you
will
that
all
things
live
on
each
other
but
is
it
not
therefore
equally
true
that
all
things
live
for
each
other
that
and
not
selfishness
is
at
the
bottom
the
law
of
nature
as
it
is
the
law
of
grace
and
the
law
of
as
it
is
the
law
of
all
religion
and
virtue
worthy
of
the
name
is
it
not
true
that
everything
has
to
help
something
else
to
live
whether
it
knows
it
or
not
that
not
a
plant
or
an
animal
can
turn
again
to
its
dust
without
giving
food
and
existence
to
other
plants
other
animals
that
the
very
tiger
seemingly
the
most
useless
tyrant
of
all
tyrants
is
still
of
use
when
after
sending
out
of
the
world
suddenly
and
all
but
painlessly
many
an
animal
which
would
without
him
have
starved
in
misery
through
a
diseased
old
age
he
himself
dies
and
in
dying
gives
by
his
own
carcase
the
means
of
life
and
of
enjoyment
to
a
thousandfold
more
living
creatures
than
ever
his
paws
destroyed
and
so
the
longer
one
watches
the
great
struggle
for
existence
the
more
charitable
the
more
hopeful
one
becomes
as
one
sees
that
consciously
or
unconsciously
the
law
of
nature
is
after
all
unconscious
in
plants
and
animals
as
far
as
we
know
save
always
those
magnificent
instances
of
true
shown
by
the
social
insects
by
ants
bees
and
others
which
put
to
shame
by
a
civilization
truly
noble
why
should
i
not
say
divine
for
god
ordained
it
the
selfishness
and
barbarism
of
man
but
be
that
as
it
may
in
man
the
law
of
whether
unconscious
or
not
in
the
animals
rises
into
consciousness
just
as
far
as
he
is
a
man
and
the
crowning
lesson
of
geology
may
be
when
we
have
worked
it
out
after
all
the
lesson
of
of
the
infinite
of
god
for
man
and
nature
as
well
as
religion
may
say
to
us
ah
could
you
crush
that
ever
craving
lust
for
bliss
which
kills
all
bliss
and
lose
your
life
your
barren
unit
life
to
find
again
a
thousand
times
in
those
for
whom
you
die
so
were
you
men
and
women
and
should
hold
your
rightful
rank
in
god
great
universe
wherein
in
heaven
or
earth
by
will
or
nature
naught
lives
for
self
all
all
from
crown
to
base
the
lamb
before
the
world
foundation
slain
the
angels
ministers
to
god
elect
the
sun
who
only
shines
to
light
the
worlds
the
clouds
whose
glory
is
to
die
in
showers
the
fleeting
streams
who
in
their
ocean
graves
flee
the
decay
of
stagnant
the
oak
ennobled
by
the
shipwright
axe
the
soil
which
yields
its
marrow
to
the
flower
the
flower
which
feeds
a
thousand
velvet
worms
born
only
to
be
prey
to
every
bird
all
spend
themselves
on
others
and
shall
man
whose
being
is
the
mystic
knot
which
couples
earth
with
heaven
doubly
bound
as
being
both
worm
and
angel
to
that
service
by
which
both
worms
and
angels
hold
their
life
shall
he
whose
every
breath
is
debt
on
debt
refuse
forsooth
to
be
what
god
has
made
him
no
let
him
show
himself
the
creatures
lord
by
gift
of
that
which
they
perforce
by
nature
laws
endure
my
friends
scientific
and
others
if
the
study
of
shall
help
to
teach
you
this
or
anything
like
this
i
think
that
though
it
may
not
make
you
more
happy
it
may
yet
make
you
more
wise
and
therefore
what
is
better
than
being
more
happy
namely
more
blessed
heroism
it
is
an
open
question
whether
the
policeman
is
not
demoralizing
us
and
that
in
proportion
as
he
does
his
duty
well
whether
the
perfection
of
justice
and
safety
the
complete
preservation
of
body
and
goods
may
not
reduce
the
educated
and
comfortable
classes
into
that
condition
in
which
not
conscience
but
comfort
doth
make
cowards
of
us
all
our
forefathers
had
on
the
whole
to
take
care
of
themselves
we
find
it
more
convenient
to
hire
people
to
take
care
of
us
so
much
the
better
for
us
in
some
respects
but
it
may
be
so
much
the
worse
in
others
so
much
the
better
because
as
usually
results
from
the
division
of
labour
these
people
having
little
or
nothing
to
do
save
to
take
care
of
us
do
so
far
better
than
we
could
and
so
prevent
a
vast
amount
of
violence
and
wrong
and
therefore
of
misery
especially
to
the
weak
for
which
last
reason
we
will
acquiesce
in
the
existence
of
policemen
and
lawyers
as
we
do
in
the
results
of
arbitration
as
the
lesser
of
two
evils
the
odds
in
war
are
in
favour
of
the
bigger
bully
in
arbitration
in
favour
of
the
bigger
rogue
and
it
is
a
question
whether
the
lion
or
the
fox
be
the
safer
guardian
of
human
interests
but
arbitration
prevents
war
and
that
in
three
cases
out
of
four
is
full
reason
for
employing
it
on
the
other
hand
the
condition
whether
in
dogs
or
in
men
is
certainly
unfavourable
to
the
growth
of
the
higher
virtues
safety
and
comfort
are
good
indeed
for
the
good
for
the
brave
the
the
earnest
they
give
to
such
a
clear
stage
and
no
favour
wherein
to
work
unhindered
for
their
but
for
the
majority
who
are
neither
brave
nor
earnest
but
the
mere
puppets
of
circumstance
safety
and
comfort
may
and
actually
do
merely
make
their
lives
mean
and
petty
effeminate
and
dull
therefore
their
hearts
must
be
awakened
as
often
as
possible
to
take
exercise
enough
for
health
and
they
must
be
reminded
perpetually
and
importunately
of
what
a
certain
great
philosopher
called
whatsoever
things
are
true
honourable
just
pure
lovely
and
of
good
report
if
there
be
any
manhood
and
any
just
praise
to
think
of
such
things
this
pettiness
and
dulness
of
our
modern
life
is
just
what
keeps
alive
our
stage
to
which
people
go
to
see
something
a
little
less
petty
a
little
less
dull
than
what
they
see
at
home
it
is
too
the
cause
of
i
had
almost
said
the
excuse
for
the
modern
rage
for
sensational
novels
those
who
read
them
so
greedily
are
conscious
poor
souls
of
capacities
in
themselves
of
passion
and
action
for
good
and
evil
for
which
their
frivolous
humdrum
daily
life
gives
no
room
no
vent
they
know
too
well
that
human
nature
can
be
more
fertile
whether
in
weeds
and
poisons
or
in
flowers
and
fruits
than
it
is
usually
in
the
streets
and
houses
of
a
and
tolerably
sober
city
and
because
the
study
of
human
nature
is
after
all
that
which
is
nearest
to
every
one
and
most
interesting
to
every
one
therefore
they
go
to
fiction
since
they
can
not
go
to
fact
to
see
what
they
themselves
might
be
had
they
the
chance
to
see
what
fantastic
tricks
before
high
heaven
men
and
women
like
themselves
can
play
and
how
they
play
them
well
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
for
me
to
blame
i
will
only
say
that
there
are
those
who
can
not
read
sensational
novels
or
indeed
any
novels
at
all
just
because
they
see
so
many
sensational
novels
being
enacted
round
them
in
painful
facts
of
sinful
flesh
and
blood
there
are
those
too
who
have
looked
in
the
mirror
too
often
to
wish
to
see
their
own
disfigured
visage
in
it
any
more
who
are
too
tired
of
themselves
and
ashamed
of
themselves
to
want
to
hear
of
people
like
themselves
who
want
to
hear
of
people
utterly
unlike
themselves
more
noble
and
able
and
just
and
sweet
and
pure
who
long
to
hear
of
heroism
and
to
converse
with
heroes
and
who
if
by
chance
they
meet
with
an
heroic
act
bathe
their
spirits
in
that
as
in
and
feel
themselves
thereby
if
but
for
an
hour
more
fair
if
any
such
shall
chance
to
see
these
words
let
me
ask
them
to
consider
with
me
that
one
word
hero
and
what
it
means
hero
heroic
heroism
these
words
point
to
a
phase
of
human
nature
the
capacity
for
which
we
all
have
in
ourselves
which
is
as
startling
and
as
interesting
in
its
manifestations
as
any
and
which
is
always
beautiful
always
ennobling
and
therefore
always
attractive
to
those
whose
hearts
are
not
yet
seared
by
the
world
or
brutalized
by
but
let
us
first
be
sure
what
the
words
mean
there
is
no
use
talking
about
a
word
till
we
have
got
at
its
meaning
we
may
use
it
as
a
cant
phrase
as
a
party
cry
on
platforms
we
may
even
hate
and
persecute
our
for
the
sake
of
it
but
till
we
have
clearly
settled
in
our
own
minds
what
a
word
means
it
will
do
for
fighting
with
but
not
for
working
with
socrates
of
old
used
to
tell
the
young
athenians
that
the
ground
of
all
sound
knowledge
was
to
understand
the
true
meaning
of
the
words
which
were
in
their
mouths
all
day
long
and
socrates
was
a
wiser
man
than
we
shall
ever
see
so
instead
of
beginning
an
oration
in
praise
of
heroism
i
shall
ask
my
readers
to
think
with
me
what
heroism
is
now
we
shall
always
get
most
surely
at
the
meaning
of
a
word
by
getting
at
its
etymology
that
is
at
what
it
meant
at
first
and
if
heroism
means
behaving
like
a
hero
we
must
find
out
it
seems
to
me
not
merely
what
a
hero
may
happen
to
mean
just
now
but
what
it
meant
in
the
earliest
human
speech
in
which
we
find
it
a
hero
or
a
heroine
then
among
the
old
homeric
greeks
meant
a
man
or
woman
who
was
like
the
gods
and
who
from
that
likeness
stood
superior
to
his
or
her
gods
heroes
and
men
is
a
threefold
division
of
rational
beings
with
which
we
meet
more
than
once
or
twice
those
grand
old
greeks
felt
deeply
the
truth
of
the
poet
saying
unless
above
himself
he
can
exalt
himself
how
poor
a
thing
is
man
but
more
the
greeks
supposed
these
heroes
to
be
in
some
way
or
other
partakers
of
a
divine
nature
akin
to
the

usually
either
they
or
some
ancestor
of
theirs
descended
from
a
god
or
goddess

who

between
the
divine
and
the
human
natures
and
whether
or
not
they
agree
with
the
author
altogether
all
will
agree
i
think
that
the
first
idea
of
a
hero
or
a
heroine
was
a
godlike
man
or
godlike
woman
a
godlike
man
what
varied
what
infinite
forms
of
nobleness
that
word
might
include
ever
increasing
as
men
notions
of
the
gods
became
purer
and
loftier
or
alas
decreasing
as
their
notions
became
degraded
the
old
greeks
with
that
intense
admiration
of
beauty
which
made
them
in
after
ages
the
master
sculptors
and
draughtsmen
of
their
own
and
indeed
of
any
age
would
of
course
require
in
their
hero
their
godlike
man
beauty
and
strength
manners
too
and
eloquence
and
all
outward
perfections
of
humanity
and
neglect
his
moral
qualities
neglect
i
say
but
not
ignore
the
hero
by
virtue
of
his
kindred
with
the
gods
was
always
expected
to
be
a
better
man
than
common
men
as
virtue
was
then
understood
and
how
better
let
us
see
the
hero
was
at
least
expected
to
be
more
reverent
than
other
men
to
those
divine
beings
of
whose
nature
he
partook
whose
society
he
might
enjoy
even
here
on
earth
he
might
be
unfaithful
to
his
own
high
lineage
he
might
misuse
his
gifts
by
selfishness
and
he
might
like
ajax
rage
with
mere
jealousy
and
wounded
pride
till
his
rage
ended
in
shameful
madness
and
suicide
he
might
rebel
against
the
very
gods
and
all
laws
of
right
and
wrong
till
he
perished
in
his
greek
text
smitten
down
blind
in
his
pride
for
a
sign
and
a
terror
to
mortals
but
he
ought
to
have
he
must
have
to
be
true
to
his
name
of
hero
justice
and
greek
text
that
highest
form
of
modesty
for
which
we
have
alas
no
name
in
the
english
tongue
that
perfect
respect
for
the
feelings
of
others
which
springs
out
of
perfect
and
he
must
have
too
if
he
were
to
be
a
hero
of
the
highest
type
the
instinct
of
helpfulness
the
instinct
that
if
he
were
a
kinsman
of
the
gods
he
must
fight
on
their
side
through
toil
and
danger
against
all
that
was
unlike
them
and
therefore
hateful
to
them
who
loves
not
the
old
legends
unsurpassed
for
beauty
in
the
literature
of
any
race
in
which
the
hero
stands
out
as
the
deliverer
the
destroyer
of
evil
theseus
ridding
the
land
of
robbers
and
delivering
it
from
the
yearly
tribute
of
boys
and
maidens
to
be
devoured
by
the
minotaur
perseus
slaying
the
gorgon
and
rescuing
andromeda
from
the
heracles
with
his
twelve
famous
labours
against
giants
and
monsters
and
all
the
rest
who
dared
in
the
might
of
their
manhood
greatly
to
do
and
to
suffer
and
far
in
the
fens
and
the
forests
smite
the
devourers
of
men
brood
of
the
giants
transformed
strange
without
like
who
obey
not
the
rulers
these
are
figures
whose
divine
moral
beauty
has
sunk
into
the
hearts
not
merely
of
poets
or
of
artists
but
of
men
and
women
who
suffered
and
who
feared
the
memory
of
them
fables
though
they
may
have
been
ennobled
the
old
greek
heart
they
ennobled
the
heart
of
europe
in
the
fifteenth
century
at
the
rediscovery
of
greek
literature
so
far
from
contradicting
the
christian
ideal
they
harmonised
with
i
had
almost
said
they
supplemented
that
more
tender
and
saintly
ideal
of
heroism
which
had
sprung
up
during
the
earlier
middle
ages
they
justified
and
actually
gave
a
new
life
to
the
old
noblenesses
of
chivalry
which
had
grown
up
in
the
later
middle
ages
as
a
necessary
supplement
of
active
and
manly
virtue
to
the
passive
and
feminine
virtue
of
the
cloister
they
inspired
mingling
with
these
two
other
elements
a
literature
both
in
england
france
and
italy
in
which
the
three
elements
the
saintly
the
chivalrous
and
the
greek
heroic
have
become
one
and
undistinguishable
because
all
three
are
human
and
all
three
divine
a
literature
which
developed
itself
in
ariosto
in
tasso
in
the
hypnerotomachia
the
arcadia
the
euphues
and
other
forms
sometimes
fantastic
sometimes
questionable
but
which
reached
its
perfection
in
our
own
queen
perhaps
the
most
admirable
poem
which
has
ever
been
penned
by
mortal
man
and
why
what
has
made
these
old
greek
myths
live
myths
though
they
be
and
fables
and
fair
dreams
what
though
they
have
no
body
and
perhaps
never
had
has
given
them
an
immortal
soul
which
can
speak
to
the
immortal
souls
of
all
generations
to
come
what
but
this
that
in
them
dim
it
may
be
and
undeveloped
but
still
there
lies
the
divine
idea
of
as
the
perfection
of
heroism
of
as
the
highest
duty
and
the
highest
joy
of
him
who
claims
a
kindred
with
the
gods
let
us
say
then
that
true
heroism
must
involve
those
stories
certainly
involve
it
whether
ancient
or
modern
which
the
hearts
not
of
philosophers
merely
or
poets
but
of
the
poorest
and
the
most
ignorant
have
accepted
instinctively
as
the
highest
form
of
moral
beauty
the
highest
form
and
yet
one
possible
to
all
grace
darling
rowing
out
into
the
storm
toward
the
the
drunken
private
of
the

prisoner
among
the
chinese
and
commanded
to
prostrate
himself
and
kotoo
refused
in
the
name
of
his
honour
he
would
not
bow
to
any
chinaman
on
earth
and
so
was
knocked
on
the
head
and
died
surely
a
hero
those
soldiers
of
the
keeping
their
ranks
to
let
the
women
and
children
escape
while
they
watched
the
sharks
who
in
a
few
minutes
would
be
tearing
them

sacrificed
his

for
his
married
comrade
there
in
the
drift
back
to

he
held
the
timbers
ready
to

then
in

i
heard
him
call

jake

for
your

do

and
that
was
all
heard
in

heard
of

or
the

again
on

who
when
the

caught

held
as
he
had
sworn
he
would
her
bow
against

till
every
soul
save
he
got
safe
on

through
the
hot
black
breath
of
the
burning

jim
bludso
voice
was
heard
and
they
all
had
trust
in
his
cussedness
and
knew
he
would
keep
his
word
and
sure
you
born
they
all
got
off
afore
the
smokestacks
fell
and
bludso
ghost
went
up
alone
in
the
smoke
of
the
belle
he
were
no
saint
but
at
judgment
i
run
my
chance
with
jim
of
some
pious
gentlemen
that
would
shake
hands
with
him
he
seen
his
duty
a
dead
sure
thing
and
went
for
it
there
and
then
and
christ
is
not
going
to
be
too
hard
on
a
man
that
died
for
men
to
which
gallant
poem
of
colonel
john
hay
and
he
has
written
many
gallant
and
beautiful
poems
i
have
but
one
demurrer
jim
bludso
did
not
merely
do
his
duty
but
more
than
his
duty
he
did
a
voluntary
deed
to
which
he
was
bound
by
no
code
or
contract
civil
or
moral
just
as
he
who
introduced
me
to
that
poem
won
his
victoria
cross
as
many
a
cross
victoria
and
other
has
been
won
by
volunteering
for
a
deed
to
which
he
too
was
bound
by
no
code
or
contract
military
or
moral
and
it
is
of
the
essence
of
and
therefore
of
heroism
that
it
should
be
voluntary
a
work
of
supererogation
at
least
towards
society
and
man
an
act
to
which
the
hero
or
heroine
is
not
bound
by
duty
but
which
is
above
though
not
against
duty
nay
on
the
strength
of
that
same
element
of
i
will
not
grudge
the
epithet
heroic
which
my
revered
friend
darwin
justly
applies
to
the
poor
little
monkey
who
once
in
his
life
did
that
which
was
above
his
duty
who
lived
in
continual
terror
of
the
great
baboon
and
yet
when
the
brute
had
sprung
upon
his
friend
the
keeper
and
was
tearing
out
his
throat
conquered
his
fear
by
love
and
at
the
risk
of
instant
death
sprang
in
turn
upon
his
dreaded
enemy
and
bit
and
shrieked
till
help
arrived
some
would
use
that
story
merely
to
prove
that
the
nature
and
the
man
nature
are
after
all
one
and
the
same
well
i
at
least
have
never
denied
that
there
is
a
in
man
as
there
is
a
and
a
and
a
of
all
which
four
i
see
every
day
too
much
the
sharp
and
stern
distinction
between
men
and
animals
as
far
as
their
natures
are
concerned
is
of
a
more
modern
origin
than
people
fancy
of
old
the
assyrian
took
the
eagle
the
ox
and
the
lion
and
not
unwisely
as
the
three
highest
types
of
human
capacity
the
horses
of
homer
might
be
immortal
and
weep
for
their
master
death
the
animals
and
monsters
of
greek
myth
like
the
ananzi
spider
of
negro
fable
glide
insensibly
into
speech
and
reason
birds
the
most
wonderful
of
all
animals
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
of
science
or
a
poet
are
sometimes
looked
on
as
wiser
and
nearer
to
the
gods
than
man
the
norseman
the
noblest
and
ablest
human
being
save
the
greek
of
whom
history
can
tell
us
was
not
ashamed
to
say
of
the
bear
of
his
native
forests
that
he
had
ten
men
strength
and
eleven
men
wisdom
how
could
reinecke
fuchs
have
gained
immortality
in
the
middle
ages
and
since
save
by
the
truth
of
its
too
solid
and
humiliating
theorem
that
the
actions
of
the
world
of
men
were
on
the
whole
guided
by
passions
but
too
exactly
like
those
of
the
lower
animals
i
have
said
and
say
again
with
good
old
vaughan
unless
above
himself
he
can
exalt
himself
how
mean
a
thing
is
man
but
i
can
not
forget
that
many
an
old
greek
poet
or
sage
and
many
a
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
century
one
would
have
interpreted
the
monkey
heroism
from
quite
a
different
point
of
view
and
would
have
said
that
the
poor
little
creature
had
been
visited
suddenly
by
some
divine
afflatus
an
expression
quite
as
philosophical
and
quite
as
intelligible
as
most
philosophic
formulas
which
i
read
and
had
been
thus
raised
for
the
moment
above
his
abject
selfish
just
as
man
requires
to
be
raised
above
his
but
that
theory
belongs
to
a
philosophy
which
is
out
of
date
and
out
of
fashion
and
which
will
have
to
wait
a
century
or
two
before
it
comes
into
fashion
again
and
now
if
and
heroism
be
as
i
believe
identical
i
must
protest
against
a
use
of
the
word
sacrifice
which
is
growing
too
common
in
in
which
we
are
told
of
an
enormous
sacrifice
of
life
an
expression
which
means
merely
that
a
great
many
poor
wretches
have
been
killed
quite
against
their
own
will
and
for
no
purpose
whatsoever
no
sacrifice
at
all
unless
it
be
one
to
the
demons
of
ignorance
cupidity
or
mismanagement
the
stout
whig
undergraduate
understood
better
the
meaning
of
such
words
who
when
asked
in
what
sense
might
charles
the
first
be
said
to
be
a
martyr
answered
in
the
same
sense
that
a
man
might
be
said
to
be
a
martyr
to
the
gout
and
i
must
protest
in
like
wise
against
a
misuse
of
the
words
hero
heroism
heroic
which
is
becoming
too
common
namely
applying
them
to
mere
courage
we
have
borrowed
the
misuse
i
believe
as
we
have
more
than
one
beside
from
the
french
press
i
trust
that
we
shall
neither
accept
it
nor
the
temper
which
inspires
it
it
may
be
convenient
for
those
who
flatter
their
nation
and
especially
the
military
part
of
it
into
a
ruinous
to
frame
some
such
syllogism
as
this
courage
is
heroism
every
frenchman
is
naturally
courageous
therefore
every
frenchman
is
a
hero
but
we
who
have
been
trained
at
once
in
a
sounder
school
of
morals
and
in
a
greater
respect
for
facts
and
for
language
as
the
expression
of
facts
shall
be
careful
i
hope
not
to
trifle
thus
with
that
potent
and
awful
engine
human
speech
we
shall
eschew
likewise
i
hope
a
like
abuse
of
the
word
moral
which
has
crept
from
the
french
press
now
and
then
not
only
into
our
own
press
but
into
the
writings
of
some
of
our
military
men
who
as
englishmen
should
have
known
better
we
were
told
again
and
again
during
the
late
war
that
the
moral
effect
of
such
a
success
had
been
great
that
the
morale
of
the
troops
was
excellent
or
again
that
the
morale
of
the
troops
had
suffered
or
even
that
they
were
somewhat
demoralised
but
when
one
came
to
test
what
was
really
meant
by
these
fine
words
one
discovered
that
morals
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts
which
they
expressed
that
the
troops
were
in
the
one
case
actuated
simply
by
the
animal
passion
of
hope
in
the
other
simply
by
the
animal
passion
of
fear
this
abuse
of
the
word
moral
has
crossed
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
atlantic
and
a
witty
american
whom
we
must
excuse
though
we
must
not
imitate
when
some
one
had
been
blazing
away
at
him
with
a
revolver
he
being
unarmed
is
said
to
have
described
his
very
natural
emotions
on
the
occasion
by
saying
that
he
felt
dreadfully
demoralised
we
i
hope
shall
confine
the
word
demoralisation
as
our
generals
of
the
last
century
would
have
done
when
applied
to
soldiers
to
crime
including
of
course
the
neglect
of
duty
or
of
discipline
and
we
shall
mean
by
the
word
heroism
in
like
manner
whether
applied
to
a
soldier
or
to
any
human
being
not
mere
courage
not
the
mere
doing
of
duty
but
the
doing
of
something
beyond
duty
something
which
is
not
in
the
bond
some
spontaneous
and
unexpected
act
of
i
am
glad
but
not
surprised
to
see
that
miss
yonge
has
held
to
this
sound
distinction
in
her
golden
little
book
of
deeds
and
said
obedience
at
all
costs
and
risks
is
the
very
essence
of
a
life
it
has
the
solid
material
but
it
has
hardly
the
exceptional
brightness
of
a
golden
deed
i
know
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
draw
the
line
between
mere
obedience
to
duty
and
express
heroism
i
know
also
that
it
would
be
both
invidious
and
impertinent
in
an
utterly
unheroic
personage
like
me
to
try
to
draw
that
line
and
to
sit
at
home
at
ease
analysing
and
criticising
deeds
which
i
could
not
do
myself
but
to
give
an
instance
or
two
of
what
i
mean
to
defend
a
post
as
long
as
it
is
tenable
is
not
heroic
it
is
simple
duty
to
defend
it
after
it
has
become
untenable
and
even
to
die
in
so
doing
is
not
heroic
but
a
noble
madness
unless
an
advantage
is
to
be
gained
thereby
for
one
own
side
then
indeed
it
rises
towards
if
not
into
the
heroism
of
who
for
example
will
not
endorse
the
verdict
of
all
ages
on
the
conduct
of
those
spartans
at
thermopylae
when
they
sat
combing
their
yellow
hair
for
death
on
the
they
devoted
themselves
to
hopeless
destruction
but
why
they
felt
i
must
believe
that
for
they
behaved
as
if
they
felt
that
on
them
the
destinies
of
the
western
world
might
hang
that
they
were
in
the
forefront
of
the
battle
between
civilisation
and
barbarism
between
freedom
and
despotism
and
that
they
must
teach
that
vast
mob
of
persian
slaves
whom
the
officers
of
the
great
king
were
driving
with
whips
up
to
their
that
the
spirit
of
the
old
heroes
was
not
dead
and
that
the
greek
even
in
defeat
and
death
was
a
mightier
and
a
nobler
man
than
they
and
they
did
their
work
they
produced
if
you
will
a
moral
effect
which
has
lasted
even
to
this
very
day
they
struck
terror
into
the
heart
not
only
of
the
persian
host
but
of
the
whole
persian
empire
they
made
the
event
of
that
war
certain
and
the
victories
of
salamis
and
plataea
comparatively
easy
they
made
alexander
conquest
of
the
east
years
afterwards
not
only
possible
at
all
but
permanent
when
it
came
and
thus
helped
to
determine
the
future
civilisation
of
the
whole
world
they
did
not
of
course
foresee
all
this
no
great
or
inspired
man
can
foresee
all
the
consequences
of
his
deeds
but
these
men
were
as
i
hold
inspired
to
see
somewhat
at
least
of
the
mighty
stake
for
which
they
played
and
to
count
their
lives
worthless
if
sparta
had
sent
them
thither
to
help
in
that
great
game
or
shall
we
refuse
the
name
of
heroic
to
those
three
german
cavalry
regiments
who
in
the
battle
of
mars
la
tour
were
bidden
to
hurl
themselves
upon
the
chassepots
and
mitrailleuses
of
the
unbroken
french
infantry
and
went
to
almost
certain
death
over
the
corpses
of
their
comrades
on
and
in
and
through
reeling
man
over
horse
horse
over
man
and
clung
like
to
their
work
and
would
hardly
leave
even
at
the
till
in
one
regiment
thirteen
officers
out
of
nineteen
were
killed
or
wounded
and
why
because
the
french
army
must
be
stopped
if
it
were
but
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
respite
must
be
gained
for
the
exhausted
third
corps
and
how
much
might
be
done
even
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
by
men
who
knew
when
and
where
and
why
to
die
who
will
refuse
the
name
of
heroes
to
these
men
and
yet
they
probably
would
have
utterly
declined
the
honour
they
had
but
done
that
which
was
in
the
bond
they
were
but
obeying
orders
after
all
as
miss
yonge
well
says
of
all
heroic
persons
have
but
done
that
which
it
was
my
duty
to
do
is
the
natural
answer
of
those
capable
of
such
actions
they
have
been
constrained
to
them
by
duty
or
pity
have
never
deemed
it
possible
to
act
otherwise
and
did
not
once
think
of
themselves
in
the
matter
at
all
these
last
true
words
bring
us
to
another
element
in
heroism
its
simplicity
whatsoever
is
not
simple
whatsoever
is
affected
boastful
wilful
covetous
tarnishes
even
destroys
the
heroic
character
of
a
deed
because
all
these
faults
spring
out
of
self
on
the
other
hand
wherever
you
find
a
perfectly
simple
frank
unconscious
character
there
you
have
the
possibility
at
least
of
heroic
action
for
it
is
nobler
far
to
do
the
most
commonplace
duty
in
the
household
or
behind
the
counter
with
a
single
eye
to
duty
simply
because
it
must
be
done
nobler
far
i
say
than
to
go
out
of
your
way
to
attempt
a
brilliant
deed
with
a
double
mind
and
saying
to
yourself
not
only
this
will
be
a
brilliant
deed
but
also
and
it
will
pay
me
or
raise
me
or
set
me
off
into
the
bargain
heroism
knows
no
into
the
bargain
and
therefore
again
i
must
protest
against
applying
the
word
heroic
to
any
deeds
however
charitable
however
toilsome
however
dangerous
performed
for
the
sake
of
what
certain
french
ladies
i
am
told
call
faire
son
salut
saving
one
soul
in
the
world
to
come
i
do
not
mean
to
judge
other
and
quite
unselfish
motives
may
be
and
doubtless
often
are
mixed
up
with
that
selfish
one
womanly
pity
and
tenderness
love
for
and
desire
to
imitate
a
certain
incarnate
ideal
of
who
is
at
once
human
and
divine
but
that
motive
of
saving
the
soul
which
is
too
often
openly
proposed
and
proffered
is
utterly
unheroic
the
desire
to
escape
pains
and
penalties
hereafter
by
pains
and
penalties
here
the
balance
of
present
loss
against
future
gain
what
is
this
but
selfishness
extended
out
of
this
world
into
eternity
not
worldliness
indeed
as
a
satirist
once
said
with
bitter
truth
but
moreover
and
the
young
and
the
enthusiastic
should
also
bear
this
in
mind
though
heroism
means
the
going
beyond
the
limits
of
strict
duty
it
never
means
the
going
out
of
the
path
of
strict
duty
if
it
is
your
duty
to
go
to
london
go
thither
you
may
go
as
much
further
as
you
choose
after
that
but
you
must
go
to
london
first
do
your
duty
first
it
will
be
time
after
that
to
talk
of
being
heroic
and
therefore
one
must
seriously
warn
the
young
lest
they
mistake
for
heroism
and
what
is
merely
pride
and
discontent
with
the
relations
by
which
god
has
bound
them
and
the
circumstances
which
god
has
appointed
for
them
i
have
known
girls
think
they
were
doing
a
fine
thing
by
leaving
uncongenial
parents
or
disagreeable
sisters
and
cutting
out
for
themselves
as
they
fancied
a
more
useful
and
elevated
line
of
life
than
that
of
mere
home
duties
while
after
all
poor
things
they
were
only
saying
with
the
pharisees
of
old
corban
it
is
a
gift
by
whatsoever
thou
mightest
be
profited
by
me
and
in
the
name
of
god
neglecting
the
command
of
god
to
honour
their
father
and
mother
there
are
men
too
who
will
neglect
their
households
and
leave
their
children
unprovided
for
and
even
uneducated
while
they
are
spending
their
money
on
philanthropic
or
religious
hobbies
of
their
own
it
is
ill
to
take
the
children
bread
and
cast
it
to
the
dogs
or
even
to
the
angels
it
is
ill
i
say
trying
to
make
god
presents
before
we
have
tried
to
pay
god
our
debts
the
first
duty
of
every
man
is
to
the
wife
whom
he
has
married
and
to
the
children
whom
she
has
brought
into
the
world
and
to
neglect
them
is
not
heroism
but
the
conceit
that
a
man
is
so
necessary
to
almighty
god
that
god
will
actually
allow
him
to
do
wrong
if
he
can
only
thereby
secure
the
man
invaluable
services
be
sure
that
every
motive
which
comes
not
from
the
single
eye
every
motive
which
springs
from
self
is
by
its
very
essence
unheroic
let
it
look
as
gaudy
or
as
beneficent
as
it
may
but
i
can
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
the
same
of
the
love
of
approbation
the
desire
for
the
love
and
respect
of
our
that
must
not
be
excluded
from
the
list
of
heroic
motives
i
know
that
it
is
or
may
be
proved
to
be
by
victorious
analysis
an
emotion
common
to
us
and
the
lower
animals
and
yet
no
man
excludes
it
less
than
that
true
hero
paul
if
those
brave
spartans
if
those
brave
germans
of
whom
i
spoke
just
now
knew
that
their
memories
would
be
wept
over
and
worshipped
by
brave
men
and
fair
women
and
that
their
names
would
become
watchwords
to
children
in
their
fatherland
what
is
that
to
us
save
that
it
should
make
us
rejoice
if
we
be
truly
human
that
they
had
that
thought
with
them
in
their
last
moments
to
make
more
easy
and
death
more
sweet
and
yet
and
yet
is
not
the
highest
heroism
that
which
is
free
even
from
the
approbation
of
our
even
from
the
approbation
of
the
best
and
wisest
the
heroism
which
is
known
only
to
our
father
who
seeth
in
secret
the
godlike
deeds
alone
in
the
lonely
chamber
the
godlike
lives
lived
in
obscurity
a
heroism
rare
among
us
men
who
live
perforce
in
the
glare
and
noise
of
the
outer
world
more
common
among
women
women
of
whom
the
world
never
hears
who
if
the
world
discovered
them
would
only
draw
the
veil
more
closely
over
their
faces
and
their
hearts
and
entreat
to
be
left
alone
with
god
true
they
can
not
always
hide
they
must
not
always
hide
or
their
would
lose
the
golden
lesson
but
nevertheless
it
is
of
the
essence
of
the
perfect
and
womanly
heroism
in
which
as
in
all
spiritual
forces
woman
transcends
the
man
that
it
would
hide
if
it
could
and
it
was
a
pleasant
thought
to
me
when
i
glanced
lately
at
the
golden
deeds
of
woman
in
miss
yonge
book
it
was
a
pleasant
thought
to
me
that
i
could
say
to
myself
ah
yes
these
heroines
are
known
and
their
fame
flies
through
the
mouths
of
men
but
if
so
how
many
thousands
of
heroines
there
must
have
been
how
many
thousands
there
may
be
now
of
whom
we
shall
never
know
but
still
they
are
there
they
sow
in
secret
the
seed
of
which
we
pluck
the
flower
and
eat
the
fruit
and
know
not
that
we
pass
the
sower
daily
in
the
street
perhaps
some
humble
woman
earning
painfully
her
own
small
sustenance
she
who
nurses
a
bedridden
mother
instead
of
sending
her
to
the
workhouse
she
who
spends
her
heart
and
her
money
on
a
drunken
father
a
reckless
brother
on
the
orphans
of
a
kinsman
or
a
friend
she
who
but
why
go
on
with
the
long
list
of
great
little
heroisms
with
which
a
clergyman
at
least
comes
in
contact
daily
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
ennobling
privileges
of
a
clergyman
high
calling
that
he
does
come
in
contact
with
them
why
go
on
i
say
save
to
commemorate
one
more
form
of
great
little
heroism
the
commonest
and
yet
the
least
remembered
of
all
namely
the
heroism
of
an
average
mother
ah
when
i
think
of
that
last
broad
fact
i
gather
hope
again
for
poor
humanity
and
this
dark
world
looks
bright
this
diseased
world
looks
wholesome
to
me
once
more
because
whatever
else
it
is
or
is
not
full
of
it
is
at
least
full
of
mothers
while
the
satirist
only
sneers
as
at
a
stock
butt
for
his
ridicule
at
the
managing
mother
trying
to
get
her
daughters
married
off
her
hands
by
chicaneries
and
meannesses
which
every
novelist
knows
too
well
how
to
draw
would
to
heaven
he
or
rather
alas
she
would
find
some
more
chivalrous
employment
for
his
or
her
pen
for
were
they
not
too
born
of
woman
i
only
say
to
myself
having
had
always
a
secret
fondness
for
poor
rebecca
though
i
love
esau
more
than
jacob
let
the
poor
thing
alone
with
pain
she
brought
these
girls
into
the
world
with
pain
she
educated
them
according
to
her
light
with
pain
she
is
trying
to
obtain
for
them
the
highest
earthly
blessing
of
which
she
can
conceive
namely
to
be
well
married
and
if
in
doing
that
last
she
manoeuvres
a
little
commits
a
few
basenesses
even
tells
a
few
untruths
what
does
all
that
come
to
save
this
that
in
the
confused
intensity
of
her
motherly
sacrifice
she
will
sacrifice
for
her
daughters
even
her
own
conscience
and
her
own
credit
we
may
sneer
if
we
will
at
such
a
poor
soul
when
we
meet
her
in
society
our
duty
both
as
christians
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
seems
to
me
to
be
to
do
for
her
something
very
different
indeed
but
to
return
looking
at
the
amount
of
great
little
heroisms
which
are
being
as
i
assert
enacted
around
us
every
day
no
one
has
a
right
to
say
what
we
are
all
tempted
to
say
at
times
how
can
i
be
heroic
this
is
no
heroic
age
setting
me
heroic
examples
we
are
growing
more
and
more
comfortable
frivolous
more
and
more
utilitarian
more
and
more
mercenary
in
our
politics
in
our
morals
in
our
religion
thinking
less
and
less
of
honour
and
duty
and
more
and
more
of
loss
and
gain
i
am
born
into
an
unheroic
time
you
must
not
ask
me
to
become
heroic
in
it
i
do
not
deny
that
it
is
more
difficult
to
be
heroic
while
circumstances
are
unheroic
round
us
we
are
all
too
apt
to
be
the
puppets
of
circumstance
all
too
apt
to
follow
the
fashion
all
too
apt
like
so
many
minnows
to
take
our
colour
from
the
ground
on
which
we
lie
in
hopes
like
them
of
comfortable
concealment
lest
the
new
tyrant
deity
called
public
opinion
should
spy
us
out
and
like
nebuchadnezzar
of
old
cast
us
into
a
burning
fiery
furnace
which
public
opinion
can
make
very
hot
for
daring
to
worship
any
god
or
man
save
the
will
of
the
temporary
majority
yes
it
is
difficult
to
be
anything
but
poor
mean
insufficient
imperfect
people
as
like
each
other
as
so
many
sheep
and
like
so
many
sheep
having
no
will
or
character
of
our
own
but
rushing
altogether
blindly
over
the
same
gap
in
foolish
fear
of
the
same
dog
who
after
all
dare
not
bite
us
and
so
it
always
was
and
always
will
be
for
the
third
time
i
say
unless
above
himself
he
can
exalt
himself
how
poor
a
thing
is
man
but
nevertheless
any
man
or
woman
who
will
in
any
age
and
under
any
circumstances
can
live
the
heroic
life
and
exercise
heroic
influences
if
any
ask
proof
of
this
i
shall
ask
them
in
return
to
read
two
novels
novels
indeed
but
in
their
method
and
their
moral
partaking
of
that
heroic
and
ideal
element
which
will
make
them
live
i
trust
long
after
thousands
of
mere
novels
have
returned
to
their
native
dust
i
mean
miss
muloch
halifax
gentleman
and
two
books
which
no
man
or
woman
ought
to
read
without
being
the
nobler
for
them
halifax
gentleman
is
simply
the
history
of
a
poor
young
clerk
who
rises
to
be
a
wealthy
in
the
manufacturing
districts
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
but
he
contrives
to
be
an
heroic
and
ideal
clerk
and
an
heroic
and
ideal
and
that
without
doing
anything
which
the
world
would
call
heroic
or
ideal
or
in
anywise
stepping
out
of
his
sphere
minding
simply
his
own
business
and
doing
the
duty
which
lies
nearest
him
and
how
by
getting
into
his
head
from
youth
the
strangest
notion
that
in
whatever
station
or
business
he
may
be
he
can
always
be
what
he
considers
a
gentleman
and
that
if
he
only
behaves
like
a
gentleman
all
must
go
right
at
last
a
beautiful
book
as
i
said
before
somewhat
of
an
heroic
and
ideal
book
a
book
which
did
me
good
when
first
i
read
it
which
ought
to
do
any
young
man
good
who
will
read
it
and
then
try
to
be
like
john
halifax
a
gentleman
whether
in
the
shop
the
the
bank
or
the
manufactory
the
other
an
even
more
striking
instance
of
the
possibility
at
least
of
heroism
anywhere
and
everywhere
is
thackeray
on
the
meaning
of
that
book
i
can
speak
with
authority
for
my
dear
and
regretted
friend
told
me
himself
that
my
interpretation
of
it
was
the
true
one
that
this
was
the
lesson
which
he
meant
men
to
learn
therefrom
esmond
is
a
man
of
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
living
in
a
coarse
drunken
ignorant
profligate
and
altogether
unheroic
age
he
is
and
here
the
high
art
and
the
high
morality
of
thackeray
genius
is
shown
altogether
a
man
of
his
own
age
he
is
not
a
or
a
man
born
out
of
time
his
information
his
politics
his
religion
are
no
higher
than
of
those
round
him
his
manners
his
views
of
human
life
his
very
prejudices
and
faults
are
those
of
his
age
the
temptations
which
he
conquers
are
just
those
under
which
the
men
around
him
fall
but
how
does
he
conquer
them
by
holding
fast
throughout
to
honour
duty
virtue
thus
and
thus
alone
he
becomes
an
ideal
gentleman
an
hero
this
was
what
thackeray
meant
for
he
told
me
so
himself
i
say
that
it
was
possible
even
in
england
lowest
and
foulest
times
to
be
a
gentleman
and
a
hero
if
a
man
would
but
be
true
to
the
light
within
him
but
i
will
go
further
i
will
go
from
ideal
fiction
to
actual
and
yet
ideal
fact
and
say
that
as
i
read
history
the
most
unheroic
age
which
the
civilized
world
ever
saw
was
also
the
most
heroic
that
the
spirit
of
man
triumphed
most
utterly
over
his
circumstances
at
the
very
moment
when
those
circumstances
were
most
against
him
how
and
why
he
did
so
is
a
question
for
philosophy
in
the
highest
sense
of
that
word
the
fact
of
his
having
done
so
is
matter
of
history
shall
i
solve
my
own
riddle
then
have
we
not
heard
of
the
early
christian
martyrs
is
there
a
doubt
that
they
unlettered
men
slaves
weak
women
even
children
did
exhibit
under
an
infinite
sense
of
duty
issuing
in
infinite
a
heroism
such
as
the
world
had
never
seen
before
did
raise
the
ideal
of
human
nobleness
a
whole
stage
rather
say
a
whole
heaven
higher
than
before
and
that
wherever
the
tale
of
their
great
deeds
spread
men
accepted
even
if
they
did
not
copy
those
martyrs
as
ideal
specimens
of
the
human
race
till
they
were
actually
worshipped
by
succeeding
generations
wrongly
it
may
be
but
pardonably
as
a
choir
of
lesser
deities
but
is
there
on
the
other
hand
a
doubt
that
the
age
in
which
they
were
heroic
was
the
most
unheroic
of
all
ages
that
they
were
bred
lived
and
died
under
the
most
debasing
of
materialist
tyrannies
with
art
literature
philosophy
family
and
national
life
dying
or
dead
around
them
and
in
cities
the
corruption
of
which
can
not
be
told
for
very
shame
cities
compared
with
which
paris
is
the
abode
of
arcadian
simplicity
and
innocence
when
i
read
petronius
and
juvenal
and
recollect
that
they
were
the
contemporaries
of
the
apostles
when
to
give
an
instance
which
scholars
and
perhaps
happily
only
scholars
can
appreciate
i
glance
once
more
at
trimalchio
feast
and
remember
that
within
a
mile
of
that
feast
paul
may
have
been
preaching
to
a
christian
congregation
some
of
whom
for
paul
makes
no
secret
of
that
strange
fact
may
have
been
ere
their
conversion
partakers
in
just
such
vulgar
and
bestial
orgies
as
those
which
were
going
on
in
the
rich
freedman
halls
after
that
i
say
i
can
put
no
limit
to
the
possibility
of
man
becoming
heroic
even
though
he
be
surrounded
by
a
hell
on
earth
no
limit
to
the
capacities
of
any
human
being
to
form
for
himself
or
herself
a
high
and
pure
ideal
of
human
character
and
without
playing
fantastic
tricks
before
high
heaven
to
carry
out
that
ideal
in
life
and
in
the
most
commonplace
circumstances
and
the
most
menial
occupations
to
live
worthy
of
as
i
conceive
our
heavenly
birthright
and
to
imitate
the
heroes
who
were
the
kinsmen
of
the
gods
superstition
a
lecture
delivered
at
the
royal
institution
london
having
accepted
the
very
great
honour
of
being
allowed
to
deliver
here
two
lectures
i
have
chosen
as
my
subject
superstition
and
science
it
is
with
superstition
that
this
first
lecture
will
deal
the
subject
seems
to
me
especially
fit
for
a
clergyman
for
he
should
more
than
other
men
be
able
to
avoid
trenching
on
two
subjects
rightly
excluded
from
this
institution
namely
theology
that
is
the
knowledge
of
god
and
religion
that
is
the
knowledge
of
duty
if
he
knows
as
he
should
what
is
theology
and
what
is
religion
then
he
should
best
know
what
is
not
theology
and
what
is
not
religion
for
my
own
part
i
entreat
you
at
the
outset
to
keep
in
mind
that
these
lectures
treat
of
matters
entirely
physical
which
have
in
reality
and
ought
to
have
in
our
minds
no
more
to
do
with
theology
and
religion
than
the
proposition
that
theft
is
wrong
has
to
do
with
the
proposition
that
the
three
angles
of
a
triangle
are
equal
to
two
right
angles
it
is
necessary
to
premise
this
because
many
are
of
opinion
that
superstition
is
a
corruption
of
religion
and
though
they
would
agree
that
as
such
corruptio
optimi
pessima
yet
they
would
look
on
religion
as
the
state
of
spiritual
health
and
superstition
as
one
of
spiritual
disease
others
again
holding
the
same
notion
but
not
considering
that
corruptio
optimi
pessima
have
been
in
all
ages
somewhat
inclined
to
be
merciful
to
superstition
as
a
child
of
reverence
as
a
mere
accidental
misdirection
of
one
of
the
noblest
and
most
wholesome
faculties
of
man
this
is
not
the
place
wherein
to
argue
with
either
of
these
parties
and
i
shall
simply
say
that
superstition
seems
to
me
altogether
a
physical
affection
as
thoroughly
material
and
corporeal
as
those
of
eating
or
sleeping
remembering
or
dreaming
after
this
it
will
be
necessary
to
define
superstition
in
order
to
have
some
tolerably
clear
understanding
of
what
we
are
talking
about
i
beg
leave
to
define
it
as
fear
of
the
unknown
johnson
who
was
no
dialectician
and
moreover
superstitious
enough
himself
gives
eight
different
definitions
of
the
word
which
is
equivalent
to
confessing
his
inability
to
define
it
at
all
unnecessary
fear
or
scruples
in
religion
observance
of
unnecessary
and
uncommanded
rites
or
practices
religion
without
morality
false
religion
reverence
of
beings
not
proper
objects
of
reverence
false
worship
over
nicety
exactness
too
scrupulous
eight
meanings
which
on
the
principle
that
eight
eighths
or
indeed
do
not
make
one
whole
may
be
considered
as
no
definition
his
first
thought
as
often
happens
is
the
best
unnecessary
fear
but
after
that
he
wanders
the
of
the
word
is
still
to
seek
but
indeed
the
popular
meaning
thanks
to
popular
common
sense
will
generally
be
found
to
contain
in
itself
the
let
us
go
back
to
the
latin
word
superstitio
cicero
says
that
the
superstitious
element
consists
in
a
certain
empty
dread
of
the
gods
a
purely
physical
affection
if
you
will
remember
three
things
that
dread
is
in
itself
a
physical
affection
that
the
gods
who
were
dreaded
were
with
the
vulgar
who
alone
dreaded
them
merely
impersonations
of
the
powers
of
nature
that
it
was
physical
injury
which
these
gods
were
expected
to
inflict
but
he
himself
agrees
with
this
theory
of
mine
for
he
says
shortly
after
that
not
only
philosophers
but
even
the
ancient
romans
had
separated
superstition
from
religion
and
that
the
word
was
first
applied
to
those
who
prayed
all
day
ut
liberi
sui
sibi
superstites
essent
might
survive
them
on
the
etymology
no
one
will
depend
who
knows
the
remarkable
absence
of
any
etymological
instinct
in
the
ancients
in
consequence
of
their
weak
grasp
of
that
sound
inductive
method
which
has
created
modern
criticism
but
if
it
be
correct
it
is
a
natural
and
pathetic
form
for
superstition
to
take
in
the
minds
of
men
who
saw
their
children
fade
and
die
probably
the
greater
number
of
them
beneath
diseases
which
mankind
could
neither
comprehend
nor
cure
the
best
exemplification
of
what
the
ancients
meant
by
superstition
is
to
be
found
in
the
lively
and
dramatic
words
of
aristotle
great
pupil
theophrastus
the
superstitious
man
according
to
him
after
having
washed
his
hands
with
lustral
water
that
is
water
in
which
a
torch
from
the
altar
had
been
quenched
goes
about
with
a
in
his
mouth
to
keep
off
evil
influences
as
the
pigs
in
devonshire
used
in
my
youth
to
go
about
with
a
withe
of
mountain
ash
round
their
necks
to
keep
off
the
evil
eye
if
a
weasel
crosses
his
path
he
stops
and
either
throws
three
pebbles
into
the
road
or
with
the
innate
selfishness
of
fear
lets
some
one
else
go
before
him
and
attract
to
himself
the
harm
which
may
ensue
he
has
a
similar
dread
of
a
whom
he
compliments
in
the
name
of
its
mistress
pallas
athene
if
he
finds
a
serpent
in
his
house
he
sets
up
an
altar
to
it
if
he
pass
at
a
an
anointed
stone
he
pours
oil
on
it
kneels
down
and
adores
it
if
a
rat
has
nibbled
one
of
his
sacks
he
takes
it
for
a
fearful
portent
a
superstition
which
cicero
also
mentions
he
dare
not
sit
on
a
tomb
because
it
would
be
assisting
at
his
own
funeral
he
purifies
endlessly
his
house
saying
that
hecate
that
is
the
moon
has
exercised
some
malign
influence
on
it
and
many
other
purifications
he
observes
of
which
i
shall
only
say
that
they
are
by
their
nature
plainly
like
the
last
meant
as
preservatives
against
unseen
malarias
or
contagions
possible
or
impossible
he
assists
every
month
with
his
children
at
the
mysteries
of
the
orphic
priests
and
finally
whenever
he
sees
an
epileptic
patient
he
spits
in
his
own
bosom
to
avert
the
evil
omen
i
have
quoted
i
believe
every
fact
given
by
theophrastus
and
you
will
agree
i
am
sure
that
the
moving
and
inspiring
element
of
such
a
character
is
mere
bodily
fear
of
unknown
evil
the
only
superstition
attributed
to
him
which
does
not
at
first
sight
seem
to
have
its
root
in
dread
is
that
of
the
orphic
mysteries
but
of
them
muller
says
that
the
dionusos
whom
they
worshipped
was
an
infernal
deity
connected
with
hades
and
was
the
personification
not
merely
of
rapturous
pleasure
but
of
a
deep
sorrow
for
the
miseries
of
human
life
the
orphic
societies
of
greece
seem
to
have
been
peculiarly
ascetic
taking
no
animal
food
save
raw
flesh
from
the
sacrificed
ox
of
dionusos
and
plato
speaks
of
a
lower
grade
of
orphic
priests
orpheotelestai
who
used
to
come
before
the
doors
of
the
rich
and
promise
by
sacrifices
and
expiatory
songs
to
release
them
from
their
own
sins
and
those
of
their
forefathers
and
such
would
be
but
too
likely
to
get
a
hearing
from
the
man
who
was
afraid
of
a
weasel
or
an
owl
now
this
same
bodily
fear
i
verily
believe
will
be
found
at
the
root
of
all
superstition
whatsoever
but
be
it
so
fear
is
a
natural
passion
and
a
wholesome
one
without
the
instinct
of
which
causes
the
to
contract
its
tentacles
or
the
fish
to
dash
into
its
hover
species
would
be
extermined
wholesale
by
involuntary
suicide
yes
fear
is
wholesome
enough
like
all
other
faculties
as
long
as
it
is
controlled
by
reason
but
what
if
the
fear
be
not
rational
but
irrational
what
if
it
be
in
plain
homely
english
blind
fear
fear
of
the
unknown
simply
because
it
is
unknown
is
it
not
likely
then
to
be
afraid
of
the
wrong
object
to
be
hurtful
ruinous
to
animals
as
well
as
to
man
any
one
will
confess
that
who
has
ever
seen
a
horse
inflict
on
himself
mortal
injuries
in
his
frantic
attempts
to
escape
from
a
quite
imaginary
danger
i
have
good
reasons
for
believing
that
not
only
animals
here
and
there
but
whole
flocks
and
swarms
of
them
are
often
destroyed
even
in
the
wild
state
by
mistaken
fear
by
such
panics
for
instance
as
cause
a
whole
herd
of
buffalos
to
rush
over
a
bluff
and
be
dashed
to
pieces
and
remark
that
this
capacity
of
panic
fear
of
superstition
as
i
should
call
it
is
greatest
in
those
animals
the
dog
and
the
horse
for
instance
which
have
the
most
rapid
and
vivid
fancy
does
not
the
unlettered
highlander
say
all
that
i
want
to
say
when
he
attributes
to
his
dog
and
his
horse
on
the
strength
of
these
very
manifestations
of
fear
the
capacity
of
seeing
ghosts
and
fairies
before
he
can
see
them
himself
but
blind
fear
not
only
causes
evil
to
the
coward
himself
it
makes
him
a
source
of
evil
to
others
for
it
is
the
cruellest
of
all
human
states
it
transforms
the
man
into
the
likeness
of
the
cat
who
when
she
is
caught
in
a
trap
or
shut
up
in
a
room
has
too
low
an
intellect
to
understand
that
you
wish
to
release
her
and
in
the
madness
of
terror
bites
and
tears
at
the
hand
which
tries
to
do
her
good
yes
very
cruel
is
blind
fear
when
a
man
dreads
he
knows
not
what
he
will
do
he
cares
not
what
when
he
dreads
desperately
he
will
act
desperately
when
he
dreads
beyond
all
reason
he
will
behave
beyond
all
reason
he
has
no
law
of
guidance
left
save
the
lowest
selfishness
no
law
of
guidance
and
yet
his
intellect
left
unguided
may
be
rapid
and
acute
enough
to
lead
him
into
terrible
follies
infinitely
more
imaginative
than
the
lowest
animals
he
is
for
that
very
reason
capable
of
being
infinitely
more
foolish
more
cowardly
more
superstitious
he
can
what
the
lower
animals
happily
for
them
can
not
organise
his
folly
erect
his
superstitions
into
a
science
and
create
a
whole
mythology
out
of
his
blind
fear
of
the
unknown
and
when
he
has
done
that
woe
to
the
weak
for
when
he
has
reduced
his
superstition
to
a
science
then
he
will
reduce
his
cruelty
to
a
science
likewise
and
write
books
like
the
malleus
maleficarum
and
the
rest
of
the
of
the
fifteenth
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
of
which
lecky
has
of
late
told
the
world
so
much
and
told
it
most
faithfully
and
most
fairly
but
fear
of
the
unknown
is
not
that
fear
of
the
unseen
world
and
is
not
that
fear
of
the
spiritual
world
pardon
me
a
great
deal
of
that
fear
all
of
it
indeed
which
is
superstition
is
simply
not
fear
of
the
spiritual
but
of
the
material
and
of
nothing
else
the
spiritual
world
i
beg
you
to
fix
this
in
your
minds
is
not
merely
an
invisible
world
which
may
become
visible
but
an
invisible
world
which
is
by
its
essence
invisible
a
moral
world
a
world
of
right
and
wrong
and
spiritual
fear
which
is
one
of
the
noblest
of
all
affections
as
bodily
fear
is
one
of
the
basest
is
if
properly
defined
nothing
less
or
more
than
the
fear
of
doing
wrong
of
becoming
a
worse
man
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
mere
fear
of
the
unseen
the
fancy
which
conceives
the
fear
is
physical
not
spiritual
think
for
yourselves
what
difference
is
there
between
a
savage
fear
of
a
demon
and
a
hunter
fear
of
a
fall
the
hunter
sees
a
fence
he
does
not
know
what
is
on
the
other
side
but
he
has
seen
fences
like
it
with
a
great
ditch
on
the
other
side
and
suspects
one
here
likewise
he
has
seen
horses
fall
at
such
and
men
hurt
thereby
he
pictures
to
himself
his
horse
falling
at
that
fence
himself
rolling
in
the
ditch
with
possibly
a
broken
limb
and
he
recoils
from
the
picture
he
himself
has
made
and
perhaps
with
very
good
reason
his
picture
may
have
its
counterpart
in
fact
and
he
may
break
his
leg
but
his
picture
like
the
previous
pictures
from
which
it
was
compounded
is
simply
a
physical
impression
on
the
brain
just
as
much
as
those
in
dreams
now
does
the
fact
of
the
ditch
the
fall
and
the
broken
leg
being
unseen
and
unknown
make
them
a
spiritual
ditch
a
spiritual
fall
a
spiritual
broken
leg
and
does
the
fact
of
the
demon
and
his
doings
being
as
yet
unseen
and
unknown
make
them
spiritual
or
the
harm
that
he
may
do
a
spiritual
harm
what
does
the
savage
fear
lest
the
demon
should
appear
that
is
become
obvious
to
his
physical
senses
and
produce
an
unpleasant
physical
effect
on
them
he
fears
lest
the
fiend
should
entice
him
into
the
bog
break
the
over
the
brook
turn
into
a
horse
and
ride
away
with
him
or
jump
out
from
behind
a
tree
and
wring
his
neck
tolerably
hard
physical
facts
all
of
them
the
children
of
physical
fancy
regarded
with
physical
dread
even
if
the
superstition
proved
true
even
if
the
demon
did
appear
even
if
he
wrung
the
traveller
neck
in
sound
earnest
there
would
be
no
more
spiritual
agency
or
phenomenon
in
the
whole
tragedy
than
there
is
in
the
parlour
table
when
spiritual
somethings
make
spiritual
raps
upon
spiritual
wood
and
human
beings
who
are
really
spirits
and
would
to
heaven
they
would
remember
that
fact
and
what
it
means
believe
that
anything
has
happened
beyond
a
clumsy
juggler
trick
you
demur
do
you
not
see
that
the
demon
by
the
mere
fact
of
having
produced
physical
consequences
would
have
become
himself
a
physical
agent
a
member
of
physical
nature
and
therefore
to
be
explained
he
and
his
doings
by
physical
laws
if
you
do
not
see
that
conclusion
at
first
sight
think
over
it
till
you
do
it
may
seem
to
some
that
i
have
founded
my
theory
on
a
very
narrow
basis
that
i
am
building
up
an
inverted
pyramid
or
that
considering
the
numberless
complex
fantastic
shapes
which
superstition
has
assumed
bodily
fear
is
too
simple
to
explain
them
all
but
if
those
persons
will
think
a
second
time
they
must
agree
that
my
base
is
as
broad
as
the
phenomena
which
it
explains
for
every
man
is
capable
of
fear
and
they
will
see
too
that
the
cause
of
superstition
must
be
something
like
fear
which
is
common
to
all
men
for
all
at
least
as
children
are
capable
of
superstition
and
that
it
must
be
something
which
like
fear
is
of
a
most
simple
rudimentary
barbaric
kind
for
the
lowest
savage
of
whatever
he
is
not
capable
is
still
superstitious
often
to
a
very
ugly
degree
superstition
seems
indeed
to
be
next
to
the
making
of
the
earliest
method
of
asserting
his
superiority
to
the
brutes
which
has
occurred
to
that
utterly
abnormal
and
fantastic
lusus
naturae
called
man
now
let
us
put
ourselves
awhile
as
far
as
we
can
in
the
place
of
that
same
savage
and
try
whether
my
theory
will
not
justify
itself
whether
or
not
superstition
with
all
its
vagaries
may
have
been
indeed
must
have
been
the
result
of
that
ignorance
and
fear
which
he
carried
about
with
him
every
time
he
prowled
for
food
through
the
primeval
forest
a
savage
first
division
of
nature
would
be
i
should
say
into
things
which
he
can
eat
and
things
which
can
eat
him
including
of
course
his
most
formidable
enemy
and
most
savoury
food
his
in
finding
out
what
he
can
eat
we
must
remember
he
will
have
gone
through
much
experience
which
will
have
inspired
him
with
a
serious
respect
for
the
hidden
wrath
of
nature
like
those
himalayan
folk
of
whom
hooker
says
that
as
they
know
every
poisonous
plant
they
must
have
tried
them
all
not
always
with
impunity
so
he
gets
at
a
third
class
of
objects
things
which
he
can
not
eat
and
which
will
not
eat
him
but
will
only
do
him
harm
as
it
seems
to
him
out
of
pure
malice
like
poisonous
plants
and
serpents
there
are
natural
accidents
too
which
fall
into
the
same
category
stones
floods
fires
avalanches
they
hurt
him
or
kill
him
surely
for
ends
of
their
own
if
a
rock
falls
from
the
cliff
above
him
what
more
natural
than
to
suppose
that
there
is
some
giant
up
there
who
threw
it
at
him
if
he
had
been
up
there
and
strong
enough
and
had
seen
a
man
walking
underneath
he
would
certainly
have
thrown
the
stone
at
him
and
killed
him
for
first
he
might
have
eaten
the
man
after
and
even
if
he
were
not
hungry
the
man
might
have
done
him
a
mischief
and
it
was
prudent
to
prevent
that
by
doing
him
a
mischief
first
besides
the
man
might
have
a
wife
and
if
he
killed
the
man
then
the
wife
would
by
a
very
ancient
law
common
to
man
and
animals
become
the
prize
of
the
victor
such
is
the
natural
man
the
carnal
man
the
soulish
man
the
greek
text
of
paul
with
five
tolerably
acute
senses
which
are
ruled
by
five
very
acute
animal
passions
hunger
sex
rage
vanity
fear
it
is
with
the
working
of
the
last
passion
fear
that
this
lecture
has
to
do
so
the
savage
concludes
that
there
must
be
a
giant
living
in
the
cliff
who
threw
stones
at
him
with
evil
intent
and
he
concludes
in
like
wise
concerning
most
other
natural
phenomena
there
is
something
in
them
which
will
hurt
him
and
therefore
likes
to
hurt
him
and
if
he
can
not
destroy
them
and
so
deliver
himself
his
fear
of
them
grows
quite
boundless
there
are
hundreds
of
natural
objects
on
which
he
learns
to
look
with
the
same
eyes
as
the
little
boys
of
teneriffe
look
on
the
useless
and
poisonous
it
is
to
them
according
to
piazzi
smyth
a
demon
who
would
kill
them
if
it
could
only
run
after
them
but
as
it
can
not
they
shout
spanish
curses
at
it
and
pelt
it
with
volleys
of
stones
screeching
with
elfin
joy
and
using
worse
names
than
ever
when
the
poisonous
milk
spurts
out
from
its
bruised
stalks
and
if
such
be
the
attitude
of
the
uneducated
man
towards
the
permanent
terrors
of
nature
what
will
it
be
towards
those
which
are
sudden
and
seemingly
capricious
towards
storms
earthquakes
floods
blights
pestilences
we
know
too
well
what
it
has
been
one
of
blind
and
therefore
often
cruel
fear
how
could
it
be
otherwise
was
theophrastus
superstitious
man
so
very
foolish
for
pouring
oil
on
every
round
stone
i
think
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
him
this
worship
of
baetyli
was
rational
enough
they
were
aerolites
fallen
from
heaven
was
it
not
as
well
to
be
civil
to
such
messengers
from
above
to
testify
by
homage
to
them
due
awe
of
the
being
who
had
thrown
them
at
men
and
who
though
he
had
missed
his
shot
that
time
might
not
miss
it
the
next
i
think
if
we
knowing
nothing
of
either
gunpowder
astronomy
or
christianity
saw
an
armstrong
bolt
fall
within
five
miles
of
london
we
should
be
inclined
to
be
very
respectful
to
it
indeed
so
the
aerolites
or
glacial
boulders
or
polished
stone
weapons
of
an
extinct
race
which
looked
like
aerolites
were
the
children
of
ouranos
the
heaven
and
had
souls
in
them
one
by
one
of
those
strange
transformations
in
which
the
logic
of
unreason
indulges
the
image
of
diana
of
the
ephesians
which
fell
down
from
jupiter
another
was
the
ancile
the
holy
shield
which
fell
from
the
same
place
in
the
days
of
numa
pompilius
and
was
the
guardian
genius
of
rome
and
several
more
became
notable
for
ages
why
not
the
uneducated
man
of
genius
unacquainted
alike
with
metaphysics
and
with
biology
sees
like
a
child
a
personality
in
every
strange
and
object
a
cloud
like
an
angel
may
be
an
angel
a
bit
of
crooked
root
like
a
man
may
be
a
man
turned
into
wood
perhaps
to
be
turned
back
again
at
its
own
will
an
erratic
block
has
arrived
where
it
is
by
strange
unknown
means
is
not
that
an
evidence
of
its
personality
either
it
has
flown
hither
itself
or
some
one
has
thrown
it
in
the
former
case
it
has
life
and
is
proportionally
formidable
in
the
latter
he
who
had
thrown
it
is
formidable
i
know
two
erratic
blocks
of
porphyry
i
believe
there
are
three
in
cornwall
lying
one
on
serpentine
one
i
think
on
slate
which
so
i
was
always
informed
as
a
boy
were
the
stones
which
kevern
threw
after
just
when
the
latter
stole
his
host
chalice
and
paten
and
ran
away
with
them
to
the
land
end
why
not
before
we
knew
anything
about
the
action
of
icebergs
and
glaciers
that
is
until
the
last
eighty
years
that
was
as
good
a
story
as
any
other
while
how
lifelike
these
boulders
are
let
a
great
poet
testify
for
the
fact
has
not
escaped
the
delicate
eye
of
wordsworth
as
a
huge
stone
is
sometimes
seen
to
lie
couched
on
the
bald
top
of
an
eminence
wonder
to
all
who
do
the
same
espy
by
what
means
it
could
thither
come
and
whence
so
that
it
seems
a
thing
endued
with
sense
like
a
crawled
forth
that
on
a
shelf
of
rock
or
sand
reposeth
there
to
sun
itself
to
the
civilised
poet
the
fancy
becomes
a
beautiful
simile
to
a
savage
poet
it
would
have
become
a
material
and
a
very
formidable
fact
he
stands
in
the
valley
and
looks
up
at
the
boulder
on
the
fells
he
is
puzzled
by
it
he
fears
it
at
last
he
makes
up
his
mind
it
is
alive
as
the
shadows
move
over
it
he
sees
it
move
may
it
not
sleep
there
all
day
and
prowl
for
prey
all
night
he
had
been
always
afraid
of
going
up
those
fells
now
he
will
never
go
there
is
a
monster
there
childish
enough
no
doubt
but
remember
that
the
savage
is
always
a
child
so
indeed
are
millions
as
well
clothed
housed
and
policed
as
ourselves
children
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
but
of
them
i
do
not
talk
because
happily
for
the
world
their
childishness
is
so
overlaid
by
the
result
of
other
men
manhood
by
an
atmosphere
of
civilisation
and
christianity
which
they
have
accepted
at
as
the
conclusions
of
minds
wiser
than
their
own
that
they
do
all
manner
of
reasonable
things
for
bad
reasons
or
for
no
reason
at
all
save
the
passion
of
imitation
not
in
them
but
in
the
savage
can
we
see
man
as
he
is
by
nature
the
puppet
of
his
senses
and
his
passions
the
natural
slave
of
his
own
fears
but
has
the
savage
no
other
faculties
save
his
five
senses
and
five
passions
i
do
not
say
that
i
should
be
most
unphilosophical
if
i
said
it
for
the
history
of
mankind
proves
that
he
has
infinitely
more
in
him
than
that
yes
but
in
him
that
infinite
more
which
is
not
only
the
noblest
part
of
humanity
but
it
may
be
humanity
itself
is
not
to
be
counted
as
one
of
the
roots
of
superstition
for
in
the
savage
man
in
whom
superstition
certainly
originates
that
infinite
more
is
still
merely
in
him
inside
him
a
faculty
but
not
yet
a
fact
it
has
not
come
out
of
him
into
consciousness
purpose
and
act
and
is
to
be
treated
as
while
what
has
come
out
his
passions
and
senses
is
enough
to
explain
all
the
vagaries
of
superstition
a
vera
causa
for
all
its
phenomena
and
if
we
seem
to
have
found
a
sufficient
explanation
already
it
is
unphilosophical
to
look
further
at
least
till
we
have
tried
whether
our
explanation
fits
the
facts
nevertheless
there
is
another
faculty
in
the
savage
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
common
to
him
and
to
at
least
the
higher
vertebrates
fancy
the
power
of
reproducing
internal
images
of
external
objects
whether
in
its
waking
form
of
physical
memory
if
indeed
all
memory
be
not
physical
or
in
its
sleeping
form
of
dreaming
upon
this
last
which
has
played
so
very
important
a
part
in
superstition
in
all
ages
i
beg
you
to
think
a
moment
recollect
your
own
dreams
during
childhood
and
recollect
again
that
the
savage
is
always
a
child
recollect
how
difficult
it
was
for
you
in
childhood
how
difficult
it
must
be
always
for
the
savage
to
decide
whether
dreams
are
phantasms
or
realities
to
the
savage
i
doubt
not
the
food
he
eats
the
foes
he
grapples
with
in
dreams
are
as
real
as
any
waking
impressions
but
moreover
these
dreams
will
be
very
often
as
children
dreams
are
wont
to
be
of
a
painful
and
terrible
kind
perhaps
they
will
be
always
painful
perhaps
his
dull
brain
will
never
dream
save
under
the
influence
of
indigestion
or
hunger
or
an
uncomfortable
attitude
and
so
in
addition
to
his
waking
experience
of
the
terrors
of
nature
he
will
have
a
whole
besides
of
a
still
more
terrific
kind
he
walks
by
day
past
a
black
cavern
mouth
and
thinks
with
a
shudder
something
ugly
may
live
in
that
ugly
hole
what
if
it
jumped
out
upon
me
he
broods
over
the
thought
with
the
intensity
of
a
narrow
and
unoccupied
mind
and
a
few
nights
after
he
has
eaten
but
let
us
draw
a
veil
before
the
larder
of
a
savage
his
chin
is
pinned
down
on
his
chest
a
slight
congestion
of
the
brain
comes
on
and
behold
he
finds
himself
again
at
that
cavern
mouth
and
something
ugly
does
jump
out
upon
him
and
the
cavern
is
a
haunted
spot
henceforth
to
him
and
to
all
his
tribe
it
is
in
vain
that
his
family
tell
him
that
he
has
been
lying
asleep
at
home
all
the
while
he
has
the
evidence
of
his
senses
to
prove
the
contrary
he
must
have
got
out
of
himself
and
gone
into
the
woods
when
we
remember
that
certain
wise
greek
philosophers
could
find
no
better
explanation
of
dreaming
than
that
the
soul
left
the
body
and
wandered
free
we
can
not
condemn
the
savage
for
his
theory
now
i
submit
that
in
these
simple
facts
we
have
a
group
of
true
causes
which
are
the
roots
of
all
the
superstitions
of
the
world
and
if
any
one
shall
complain
that
i
am
talking
materialism
i
shall
answer
that
i
am
doing
exactly
the
opposite
i
am
trying
to
eliminate
and
get
rid
of
that
which
is
material
animal
and
base
in
order
that
that
which
is
truly
spiritual
may
stand
out
distinct
and
clear
in
its
divine
and
eternal
beauty
to
explain
and
at
the
same
time
as
i
think
to
verify
my
hypothesis
let
me
give
you
an
example
fictitious
it
is
true
but
probable
fact
nevertheless
because
it
is
patched
up
of
many
fragments
of
actual
fact
and
let
us
see
how
in
following
it
out
we
shall
pass
through
almost
every
possible
form
of
superstition
suppose
a
great
hollow
tree
in
which
the
formidable
wasps
of
the
tropics
have
built
for
ages
the
average
savage
hurries
past
the
spot
in
mere
bodily
fear
for
if
they
come
out
against
him
they
will
sting
him
to
death
till
at
last
there
comes
by
a
savage
wiser
than
the
rest
with
more
observation
reflection
imagination
independence
of
will
the
genius
of
his
tribe
the
awful
shade
of
the
great
tree
added
to
his
terror
of
the
wasps
weighs
on
him
and
excites
his
brain
perhaps
too
he
has
had
a
wife
or
a
child
stung
to
death
by
these
same
wasps
these
wasps
so
small
yet
so
wise
far
wiser
than
he
they
fly
and
they
sting
ah
if
he
could
fly
and
sting
how
he
would
kill
and
eat
and
live
right
merrily
they
build
great
towns
they
rob
far
and
wide
they
never
quarrel
with
each
other
they
must
have
some
one
to
teach
them
to
lead
them
they
must
have
a
king
and
so
he
gets
the
fancy
of
a
as
the
western
irish
still
believe
in
the
master
otter
as
the
red
men
believe
in
the
king
of
the
buffalos
and
find
the
bones
of
his
ancestors
in
the
mammoth
remains
of
lick
as
the
philistines
of
ekron
to
quote
a
notorious
instance
actually
worshipped
lord
of
the
flies
if
they
have
a
king
he
must
be
inside
that
tree
of
course
if
he
the
savage
were
a
king
he
would
not
work
for
his
bread
but
sit
at
home
and
make
others
feed
him
and
so
no
doubt
does
the
and
when
he
goes
home
he
will
brood
over
this
wonderful
discovery
of
the
till
like
a
child
he
can
think
of
nothing
else
he
will
go
to
the
tree
and
watch
for
him
to
come
out
the
wasps
will
get
accustomed
to
his
motionless
figure
and
leave
him
unhurt
till
the
new
fancy
will
rise
in
his
mind
that
he
is
a
favourite
of
this
and
at
last
he
will
find
himself
grovelling
before
the
tree
saying
oh
great
pity
me
and
tell
your
children
not
to
sting
me
and
i
will
bring
you
honey
and
fruit
and
flowers
to
eat
and
i
will
flatter
you
and
worship
you
and
you
shall
be
my
king
and
then
he
would
gradually
boast
of
his
discovery
of
the
new
mysterious
bond
between
him
and
the
and
his
tribe
would
believe
him
and
fear
him
and
fear
him
still
more
when
he
began
to
say
as
he
surely
would
not
merely
i
can
ask
the
and
he
will
tell
his
children
not
to
sting
you
but
i
can
ask
the
and
he
will
send
his
children
and
sting
you
all
to
death
vanity
and
ambition
will
have
prompted
the
threat
but
it
will
not
be
altogether
a
lie
the
man
will
more
than
half
believe
his
own
words
he
will
quite
believe
them
when
he
has
repeated
them
a
dozen
times
and
so
he
will
become
a
great
man
and
a
king
under
the
protection
of
the
king
of
the
wasps
and
he
will
become
and
it
may
be
his
children
after
him
priest
of
the
who
will
be
their
fetish
and
the
fetish
of
their
tribe
and
they
will
prosper
under
the
protection
of
the
the
wasp
will
become
their
moral
ideal
whose
virtues
they
must
copy
the
new
chief
will
preach
to
them
wild
eloquent
words
they
must
sting
like
wasps
revenge
like
wasps
hold
all
together
like
wasps
build
like
wasps
work
hard
like
wasps
rob
like
wasps
then
like
the
wasps
they
will
be
the
terror
of
all
around
and
kill
and
eat
all
their
enemies
soon
they
will
call
themselves
the
wasps
they
will
boast
that
their
king
father
or
grandfather
and
soon
that
the
ancestor
of
the
whole
tribe
was
an
actual
wasp
and
the
wasp
will
become
at
once
their
eponym
hero
their
deity
their
ideal
their
civiliser
who
has
taught
them
to
build
a
kraal
of
huts
as
he
taught
his
children
to
build
a
hive
now
if
there
should
come
to
any
thinking
man
of
this
tribe
at
this
epoch
the
new
thought
who
made
the
world
he
will
be
sorely
puzzled
the
conception
of
a
world
has
never
crossed
his
mind
before
he
never
pictured
to
himself
anything
beyond
the
nearest
ridge
of
mountains
and
as
for
a
maker
that
will
be
a
greater
puzzle
still
what
makers
or
builders
more
cunning
than
those
wasps
of
whom
his
foolish
head
is
full
of
course
he
sees
it
now
a
wasp
made
the
world
which
to
him
entirely
new
guess
might
become
an
integral
part
of
his
tribe
creed
that
would
be
their
cosmogony
and
if
a
generation
or
two
after
another
savage
genius
should
guess
that
the
world
was
a
globe
hanging
in
the
heavens
he
would
if
he
had
imagination
enough
to
take
the
thought
in
at
all
put
it
to
himself
in
a
form
suited
to
his
previous
knowledge
and
conceptions
it
would
seem
to
him
that
the
wasp
flew
about
the
skies
with
the
world
in
his
mouth
as
he
carries
a
bluebottle
fly
and
that
would
be
the
astronomy
of
his
tribe
henceforth
absurd
enough
but
as
every
man
who
is
acquainted
with
old
mythical
cosmogonies
must
know
no
more
absurd
than
twenty
similar
guesses
on
record
try
to
imagine
the
gradual
genesis
of
such
myths
as
the
egyptian
scarabaeus
and
egg
or
the
hindoo
theory
that
the
world
stood
on
an
elephant
the
elephant
on
a
tortoise
the
tortoise
on
that
infinite
note
of
interrogation
which
as
some
one
expresses
it
underlies
all
physical
speculations
and
judge
must
they
not
have
arisen
in
some
such
fashion
as
that
which
i
have
pointed
out
this
i
say
would
be
the
culminating
point
of
the
which
had
sprung
up
out
of
bodily
fear
of
being
stung
but
times
might
come
for
it
in
which
it
would
go
through
various
changes
through
which
every
superstition
in
the
world
i
suppose
has
passed
or
is
doomed
to
pass
the
might
be
conquered
and
possibly
eaten
by
a
stronger
tribe
than
themselves
what
would
be
the
result
they
would
fight
valiantly
at
first
like
wasps
but
what
if
they
began
to
fail
was
not
the
king
angry
with
them
had
not
he
deserted
them
he
must
be
appeased
he
must
have
his
revenge
they
would
take
a
captive
and
offer
him
to
the
wasps
so
did
a
north
american
tribe
in
their
need
some
forty
years
ago
when
because
their
failed
they
roasted
alive
a
captive
girl
cut
her
to
pieces
and
sowed
her
with
their
corn
i
would
not
tell
the
story
for
the
horror
of
it
did
it
not
bear
with
such
fearful
force
on
my
argument
what
were
those
red
men
thinking
of
what
chain
of
misreasoning
had
they
in
their
heads
when
they
hit
on
that
as
a
device
for
making
the
crops
grow
who
can
tell
who
can
make
the
crooked
straight
or
number
that
which
is
wanting
as
said
solomon
of
old
so
must
we
the
foolishness
of
fools
is
folly
one
thing
only
we
can
say
of
them
that
they
were
horribly
afraid
of
famine
and
took
that
means
of
ridding
themselves
of
their
fear
but
what
if
the
had
no
captives
they
would
offer
slaves
what
if
the
agony
and
death
of
slaves
did
not
appease
the
wasps
they
would
offer
their
fairest
their
dearest
their
sons
and
their
daughters
to
the
wasps
as
the
carthaginians
in
like
strait
offered
in
one
day
noble
boys
to
moloch
the
whose
worship
they
had
brought
out
of
syria
whose
original
meaning
they
had
probably
forgotten
of
whom
they
only
knew
that
he
was
a
dark
and
devouring
being
who
must
be
appeased
with
the
burning
bodies
of
their
sons
and
daughters
and
so
the
veil
of
fancy
would
be
lifted
again
and
the
whole
superstition
stand
forth
revealed
as
the
mere
offspring
of
bodily
fear
but
more
the
survivors
of
the
conquest
might
perhaps
escape
and
carry
their
into
a
new
land
but
if
they
became
poor
and
weakly
their
brains
and
imagination
degenerating
with
their
bodies
would
degrade
their
till
they
knew
not
what
it
meant
away
from
the
sacred
tree
in
a
country
the
wasps
of
which
were
not
so
large
or
formidable
they
would
require
a
remembrancer
of
the
and
they
would
make
one
a
wasp
of
wood
or
what
not
after
a
while
according
to
that
strange
law
of
fancy
the
root
of
all
idolatry
which
you
may
see
at
work
in
every
child
who
plays
with
a
doll
the
symbol
would
become
identified
with
the
thing
symbolised
they
would
invest
the
wooden
wasp
with
all
the
terrible
attributes
which
had
belonged
to
the
live
wasps
of
the
tree
and
after
a
few
centuries
when
all
remembrance
of
the
tree
the
and
chieftain
and
his
descent
from
the
divine
wasp
aye
even
of
their
defeat
and
flight
had
vanished
from
their
songs
and
legends
they
would
be
found
bowing
down
in
fear
and
trembling
to
a
little
ancient
wooden
wasp
which
came
from
they
knew
not
whence
and
meant
they
knew
not
what
save
that
it
was
a
very
old
fetish
a
great
medicine
or
some
such
other
formula
for
expressing
their
own
ignorance
and
dread
just
so
do
the
natives
of
thibet
and
the
irishwomen
of
kerry
by
a
strange
coincidence
unless
the
ancient
irish
were
buddhists
like
the
himalayans
tie
just
the
same
scraps
of
rag
on
arise
and
show
men
that
they
are
not
the
puppets
of
nature
but
her
lords
and
that
they
are
to
fear
god
and
fear
naught
else
and
so
ends
my
true
myth
of
the
no
it
need
not
end
there
it
may
develop
into
a
yet
darker
and
more
hideous
form
of
superstition
which
europe
has
often
seen
which
is
common
now
among
the
negros
which
we
may
hope
will
soon
be
exterminated
this
might
happen
for
it
or
something
like
it
has
happened
too
many
times
already
that
to
the
ancient
women
who
still
kept
up
the
irrational
remnant
of
the
beneath
the
sacred
tree
other
women
might
resort
not
merely
from
curiosity
or
an
excited
imagination
but
from
jealousy
and
revenge
oppressed
as
woman
has
always
been
under
the
reign
of
brute
force
beaten
outraged
deserted
at
best
married
against
her
will
she
has
too
often
gone
for
comfort
and
help
and
those
of
the
very
darkest
kind
to
the
works
of
darkness
and
there
never
were
wanting
there
are
not
wanting
even
now
in
remote
parts
of
these
isles
wicked
old
women
who
would
by
help
of
the
old
superstitions
do
for
her
what
she
wished
soon
would
follow
mysterious
deaths
of
rivals
of
husbands
of
babes
then
rumours
of
dark
rites
connected
with
the
sacred
tree
with
poison
with
the
wasp
and
his
sting
with
human
sacrifices
lies
mingled
with
truth
more
and
more
confused
and
frantic
the
more
they
were
misinvestigated
by
men
mad
with
fear
till
there
would
arise
one
of
those
which
are
too
common
still
among
the
african
negros
which
were
too
common
of
old
among
the
men
of
our
race
i
say
among
the
men
to
comprehend
a
you
must
look
at
it
as
what
the
confesses
it
unblushingly
to
be
dread
of
nature
excited
to
its
highest
form
as
dread
of
woman
she
is
to
the
barbarous
man
she
should
be
more
and
more
to
the
civilised
man
not
only
the
most
beautiful
and
precious
but
the
most
wonderful
and
mysterious
of
all
natural
objects
if
it
be
only
as
the
author
of
his
physical
being
she
is
to
the
savage
a
miracle
to
be
alternately
adored
and
dreaded
he
dreads
her
more
delicate
nervous
organisation
which
often
takes
shapes
to
him
demoniacal
and
miraculous
her
quicker
instincts
her
readier
wit
which
seem
to
him
to
have
in
them
somewhat
prophetic
and
superhuman
which
entangle
him
as
in
an
invisible
net
and
rule
him
against
his
will
he
dreads
her
very
tongue
more
crushing
than
his
heaviest
club
more
keen
than
his
poisoned
arrows
he
dreads
those
habits
of
secresy
and
falsehood
the
weapons
of
the
weak
to
which
savage
and
degraded
woman
always
has
recourse
he
dreads
the
very
medicinal
skill
which
she
has
learnt
to
exercise
as
nurse
comforter
and
slave
he
dreads
those
secret
ceremonies
those
mysterious
initiations
which
no
man
may
witness
which
he
has
permitted
to
her
in
all
ages
in
so
many
if
not
all
barbarous
and
races
whether
negro
american
syrian
greek
or
roman
as
a
homage
to
the
mysterious
importance
of
her
who
brings
him
into
the
world
if
she
turn
against
him
she
with
all
her
unknown
powers
she
who
is
the
sharer
of
his
deepest
secrets
who
prepares
his
very
food
day
by
day
what
harm
can
she
not
may
she
not
do
and
that
she
has
good
reason
to
turn
against
him
he
knows
too
well
what
deliverance
is
there
from
this
mysterious
save
brute
force
terror
torture
murder
must
be
the
order
of
the
day
woman
must
be
crushed
at
all
price
by
the
blind
fear
of
the
man
i
shall
say
no
more
i
shall
draw
a
veil
for
very
pity
and
shame
over
the
most
important
and
most
significant
facts
of
this
the
most
hideous
of
all
human
follies
i
have
i
think
given
you
hints
enough
to
show
that
it
like
all
other
superstitions
is
the
child
the
last
born
and
the
ugliest
child
of
blind
dread
of
the
unknown
science
a
lecture
delivered
at
the
royal
institution
i
said
that
superstition
was
the
child
of
fear
and
fear
the
child
of
ignorance
and
you
might
expect
me
to
say
antithetically
that
science
was
the
child
of
courage
and
courage
the
child
of
knowledge
but
these
genealogies
like
most
metaphors
do
not
fit
exactly
as
you
may
see
for
yourselves
if
fear
be
the
child
of
ignorance
ignorance
is
also
the
child
of
fear
the
two
react
on
and
produce
each
other
the
more
men
dread
nature
the
less
they
wish
to
know
about
her
why
pry
into
her
awful
secrets
it
is
dangerous
perhaps
impious
she
says
to
them
as
in
the
egyptian
temple
of
old
i
am
isis
and
my
veil
no
mortal
yet
hath
lifted
and
why
should
they
try
or
wish
to
lift
it
if
she
will
leave
them
in
peace
they
will
leave
her
in
peace
it
is
enough
that
she
does
not
destroy
them
so
as
ignorance
bred
fear
fear
breeds
fresh
and
willing
ignorance
and
courage
we
may
say
and
truly
that
courage
is
the
child
of
knowledge
but
we
may
say
as
truly
that
knowledge
is
the
child
of
courage
those
egyptian
priests
in
the
temple
of
isis
would
have
told
you
that
knowledge
was
the
child
of
mystery
of
special
illumination
of
reverence
and
what
not
hiding
under
grand
words
their
purpose
of
keeping
the
masses
ignorant
that
they
might
be
their
slaves
reverence
i
will
yield
to
none
in
reverence
for
reverence
i
will
all
but
agree
with
the
wise
man
who
said
that
reverence
is
the
root
of
all
virtues
but
which
child
reverences
his
father
most
he
who
comes
joyfully
and
trustfully
to
meet
him
that
he
may
learn
his
father
mind
and
do
his
will
or
he
who
at
his
father
coming
runs
away
and
hides
lest
he
should
be
beaten
for
he
knows
not
what
there
is
a
scientific
reverence
a
reverence
of
courage
which
is
surely
one
of
the
highest
forms
of
reverence
that
namely
which
so
reveres
every
fact
that
it
dare
not
overlook
or
falsify
it
seem
it
never
so
minute
which
feels
that
because
it
is
a
fact
it
can
not
be
minute
can
not
be
unimportant
that
it
must
be
a
fact
of
god
a
message
from
god
a
voice
of
god
as
bacon
has
it
revealed
in
things
and
which
therefore
just
because
it
stands
in
solemn
awe
of
such
paltry
facts
as
the
scolopax
feather
in
a
snipe
pinion
or
the
jagged
leaves
which
appear
capriciously
in
certain
honeysuckles
believes
that
there
is
likely
to
be
some
deep
and
wide
secret
underlying
them
which
is
worth
years
of
thought
to
solve
that
is
reverence
a
reverence
which
is
growing
thank
god
more
and
more
common
which
will
produce
as
it
grows
more
common
still
fruit
which
generations
yet
unborn
shall
bless
but
as
for
that
other
reverence
which
shuts
its
eyes
and
ears
in
pious
awe
what
is
it
but
cowardice
decked
out
in
state
robes
putting
on
the
sacred
urim
and
thummim
not
that
men
may
ask
counsel
of
the
deity
but
that
they
may
not
what
is
it
but
cowardice
very
pitiable
when
unmasked
and
what
is
its
child
but
ignorance
as
pitiable
which
would
be
ludicrous
were
it
not
so
injurious
if
a
man
comes
up
to
nature
as
to
a
parrot
or
a
monkey
with
this
prevailing
thought
in
his
head
will
it
bite
me
will
he
not
be
pretty
certain
to
make
up
his
mind
that
it
may
bite
him
and
had
therefore
best
be
left
alone
it
is
only
the
man
of
courage
few
and
far
between
who
will
stand
the
chance
of
a
first
bite
in
the
hope
of
teaching
the
parrot
to
talk
or
the
monkey
to
fire
off
a
gun
and
it
is
only
the
man
of
courage
few
and
far
between
who
will
stand
the
chance
of
a
first
bite
from
nature
which
may
kill
him
for
aught
he
knows
for
her
teeth
though
clumsy
are
very
strong
in
order
that
he
may
tame
her
and
break
her
in
to
his
use
by
the
very
same
method
by
which
that
admirable
inductive
philosopher
rarey
used
to
break
in
his
horses
first
by
not
being
afraid
of
them
and
next
by
trying
to
find
out
what
they
were
thinking
of
but
after
all
as
with
animals
so
with
nature
cowardice
is
dangerous
the
surest
method
of
getting
bitten
by
an
animal
is
to
be
afraid
of
it
and
the
surest
method
of
being
injured
by
nature
is
to
be
afraid
of
it
only
as
far
as
we
understand
nature
are
we
safe
from
it
and
those
who
in
any
age
counsel
mankind
not
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
the
universe
counsel
them
not
to
provide
for
their
own
life
and
or
for
their
children
after
them
but
how
few
there
have
been
in
any
age
who
have
not
been
afraid
of
nature
how
few
have
set
themselves
like
rarey
to
tame
her
by
finding
out
what
she
is
thinking
of
the
mass
are
glad
to
have
the
results
of
science
as
they
are
to
buy
rarey
horses
after
they
are
tamed
but
for
want
of
courage
or
of
wit
they
had
rather
leave
the
taming
process
to
some
one
else
and
therefore
we
may
say
that
what
knowledge
of
nature
we
have
and
we
have
very
little
we
owe
to
the
courage
of
those
men
and
they
have
been
very
few
who
have
been
inspired
to
face
nature
boldly
and
say
or
what
is
better
act
as
if
they
were
saying
i
find
something
in
me
which
i
do
not
find
in
you
which
gives
me
the
hope
that
i
can
grow
to
understand
you
though
you
may
not
understand
me
that
i
may
become
your
master
and
not
as
now
you
mine
and
if
not
i
will
know
or
die
in
the
search
it
is
to
those
men
the
few
and
far
between
in
a
very
few
ages
and
very
few
countries
who
have
thus
risen
in
rebellion
against
nature
and
looked
it
in
the
face
with
an
unquailing
glance
that
we
owe
what
we
call
physical
science
there
have
been
four
races
or
rather
a
very
few
men
of
each
four
races
who
have
faced
nature
after
this
gallant
wise
first
the
old
jews
i
speak
of
them
be
it
remembered
exclusively
from
an
historical
and
not
a
religious
point
of
view
these
people
at
a
very
remote
epoch
emerged
from
a
country
highly
civilised
but
sunk
in
the
superstitions
of
they
invaded
and
mingled
with
tribes
whose
superstitions
were
even
more
debased
silly
and
foul
than
those
of
the
egyptians
from
whom
they
escaped
their
own
masses
were
for
centuries
given
up
to
now
among
those
jews
arose
men
a
very
few
sages
prophets
call
them
what
you
will
the
men
were
inspired
heroes
and
philosophers
who
assumed
towards
nature
an
attitude
utterly
different
from
the
rest
of
their
countrymen
and
the
rest
of
the
then
world
who
denounced
superstition
and
the
dread
of
nature
as
the
parent
of
all
manner
of
vice
and
misery
who
for
themselves
said
boldly
that
they
discerned
in
the
universe
an
order
a
unity
a
permanence
of
law
which
gave
them
courage
instead
of
fear
they
found
delight
and
not
dread
in
the
thought
that
the
universe
obeyed
a
law
which
could
not
be
broken
that
all
things
continued
to
that
day
according
to
a
certain
ordinance
they
took
a
view
of
nature
totally
new
in
that
age
healthy
human
cheerful
loving
trustful
and
yet
reverent
identical
with
that
which
happily
is
beginning
to
prevail
in
our
own
day
they
defied
those
very
volcanic
and
meteoric
phenomena
of
their
land
to
which
their
countrymen
were
slaying
their
own
children
in
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
and
like
theophrastus
superstitious
man
pouring
their
on
the
smooth
stones
of
the
valley
and
declared
that
for
their
part
they
would
not
fear
though
the
earth
was
moved
and
though
the
hills
were
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
though
the
waters
raged
and
swelled
and
the
mountains
shook
at
the
tempest
the
fact
is
indisputable
and
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
express
my
belief
that
these
men
if
they
had
felt
it
their
business
to
found
a
school
of
inductive
physical
science
would
owing
to
that
temper
of
mind
have
achieved
a
very
signal
success
i
ground
that
opinion
on
the
remarkable
but
equally
indisputable
fact
that
no
nation
has
ever
succeeded
in
perpetuating
a
school
of
inductive
physical
science
save
those
whose
minds
have
been
saturated
with
this
same
view
of
nature
which
they
have
as
an
historic
fact
slowly
but
thoroughly
learnt
from
the
writings
of
these
jewish
sages
such
is
the
fact
the
founders
of
inductive
physical
science
were
not
the
jews
but
first
the
chaldaeans
next
the
greeks
next
their
pupils
the
romans
or
rather
a
few
sages
among
each
race
but
what
success
had
they
the
chaldaean
astronomers
made
a
few
discoveries
concerning
the
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
which
rudimentary
as
they
were
still
prove
them
to
have
been
men
of
rare
intellect
for
a
great
and
a
patient
genius
must
he
have
been
who
first
distinguished
the
planets
from
the
fixed
stars
or
worked
out
the
earliest
astronomical
calculation
but
they
seem
to
have
been
crushed
as
it
were
by
their
own
discoveries
they
stopped
short
they
gave
way
again
to
the
primeval
fear
of
nature
they
sank
into
they
invented
it
would
seem
that
fantastic
of
astrology
which
lay
for
ages
after
as
an
incubus
on
the
human
intellect
and
conscience
they
became
the
magicians
and
quacks
of
the
old
world
and
mankind
owed
them
thenceforth
nothing
but
evil
among
the
greeks
and
romans
again
those
sages
who
dared
face
nature
like
reasonable
men
were
accused
by
the
superstitious
mob
as
irreverent
impious
atheists
the
wisest
of
them
all
socrates
was
actually
put
to
death
on
that
charge
and
finally
they
failed
school
after
school
in
greece
and
rome
struggled
to
discover
and
to
get
a
hearing
for
some
theory
of
the
universe
which
was
founded
on
something
like
experience
reason
common
sense
they
were
not
allowed
to
prosecute
their
attempt
the
of
ignorance
and
fear
in
which
they
struggled
so
manfully
was
too
strong
for
them
the
closed
over
their
heads
finally
as
the
age
of
the
antonines
expired
and
the
last
effort
of
thought
to
explain
the
universe
was
neoplatonism
the
muddiest
of
the
muddy
an
attempt
to
apologise
for
and
organise
into
a
system
all
the
superstitions
of
the
roman
world
porphyry
plotinus
proclus
poor
hypatia
herself
and
all
her
school
they
may
have
had
themselves
no
bodily
fear
of
nature
for
they
were
noble
souls
yet
they
spent
their
time
in
justifying
those
who
had
in
apologising
for
the
superstitions
of
the
very
mob
which
they
despised
just
as
it
sometimes
seems
to
me
some
folk
in
these
days
are
like
to
end
in
doing
begging
that
the
masses
might
be
allowed
to
believe
in
anything
however
false
lest
they
should
believe
in
nothing
at
all
as
if
believing
in
lies
could
do
anything
but
harm
to
any
human
being
and
so
died
the
science
of
the
old
world
in
a
true
second
childhood
just
where
it
began
the
jewish
sages
i
hold
taught
that
science
was
probable
the
greeks
and
romans
proved
that
it
was
possible
it
remained
for
our
race
under
the
teaching
of
both
to
bring
science
into
act
and
fact
many
causes
contributed
to
give
them
this
power
they
were
a
personally
courageous
race
this
earth
has
yet
seen
no
braver
men
than
the
forefathers
of
christian
europe
whether
scandinavian
or
teuton
angle
or
frank
they
were
a
practical
race
with
a
strong
appreciation
of
facts
and
a
strong
determination
to
act
on
them
their
laws
their
society
their
commerce
their
colonisation
their
migrations
by
land
and
sea
proved
that
they
were
such
they
were
favoured
moreover
by
circumstances
or
as
i
should
rather
put
it
by
that
divine
providence
which
determined
their
times
and
the
bounds
of
their
habitation
they
came
in
as
the
heritors
of
the
decaying
civilisation
of
greece
and
rome
they
colonised
territories
which
gave
to
man
special
fair
play
but
no
more
in
the
struggle
for
existence
the
battle
with
the
powers
of
nature
tolerably
fertile
tolerably
temperate
with
boundless
means
of
water
communication
freer
than
most
parts
of
the
world
from
those
terrible
natural
phenomena
like
the
earthquake
and
the
hurricane
before
which
man
lies
helpless
and
astounded
a
child
beneath
the
foot
of
a
giant
nature
was
to
them
not
so
inhospitable
as
to
starve
their
brains
and
limbs
as
it
has
done
for
the
esquimaux
or
fuegian
and
not
so
bountiful
as
to
crush
them
by
its
very
luxuriance
as
it
has
crushed
the
savages
of
the
tropics
they
saw
enough
of
its
strength
to
respect
it
not
enough
to
cower
before
it
and
they
and
it
have
fought
it
out
and
it
seems
to
me
standing
either
on
london
bridge
or
on
a
holland
that
they
are
winning
at
last
but
they
had
a
sore
battle
a
battle
against
their
own
fear
of
the
unseen
they
brought
with
them
out
of
the
heart
of
asia
dark
and
sad
some
of
which
linger
among
our
peasantry
till
this
day
of
elves
trolls
nixes
and
what
not
their
thor
and
odin
were
at
first
probably
only
the
thunder
and
the
wind
but
they
had
to
be
appeased
in
the
dark
marches
of
the
forest
where
hung
rotting
on
the
sacred
oaks
amid
carcases
of
goat
and
horse
the
carcases
of
human
victims
no
one
acquainted
with
the
early
legends
and
ballads
of
our
race
but
must
perceive
throughout
them
all
the
prevailing
tone
of
fear
and
sadness
and
to
their
own
superstitions
they
added
those
of
the
rome
which
they
conquered
they
dreaded
the
roman
and
witches
who
like
horace
canidia
still
performed
horrid
rites
in
and
dark
places
of
the
earth
they
dreaded
as
magical
the
delicate
images
engraved
on
old
greek
gems
they
dreaded
the
very
roman
cities
they
had
destroyed
they
were
the
work
of
enchanters
like
the
ruins
of
albans
here
in
england
they
were
all
full
of
devils
guarding
the
treasures
which
the
romans
had
hidden
the
caesars
became
to
them
magical
the
poet
virgil
became
the
prince
of
necromancers
if
the
secrets
of
nature
were
to
be
known
they
were
to
be
known
by
unlawful
means
by
prying
into
the
mysteries
of
the
old
heathen
magicians
or
of
the
mohammedan
doctors
of
cordova
and
seville
and
those
who
dared
to
do
so
were
respected
and
feared
and
often
came
to
evil
ends
it
needed
moral
courage
then
to
face
and
interpret
fact
such
brave
men
as
pope
gerbert
roger
bacon
galileo
even
kepler
did
not
lead
happy
lives
some
of
them
found
themselves
in
prison
all
the
medieval
sages
even
albertus
magnus
were
stigmatised
as
magicians
one
wonders
that
more
of
them
did
not
imitate
poor
paracelsus
who
unable
to
get
a
hearing
for
his
coarse
common
sense
took
vain
and
sensual
to
drinking
the
laudanum
which
he
himself
had
discovered
and
vaunted
as
a
priceless
boon
to
men
and
died
as
the
fool
dieth
in
spite
of
all
his
wisdom
for
the
romani
nominis
umbra
the
shadow
of
the
mighty
race
whom
they
had
conquered
lay
heavy
on
our
forefathers
for
centuries
and
their
dread
of
the
great
heathens
was
really
a
dread
of
nature
and
of
the
powers
thereof
for
when
the
authority
of
great
names
has
reigned
unquestioned
for
many
centuries
those
names
become
to
the
human
mind
integral
and
necessary
parts
of
nature
itself
they
are
as
it
were
absorbed
into
it
they
become
its
laws
its
canons
its
demiurges
and
guardian
spirits
their
words
become
regarded
as
actual
facts
in
one
word
they
become
a
superstition
and
are
feared
as
parts
of
the
vast
unknown
and
to
deny
what
they
have
said
is
in
the
minds
of
the
many
not
merely
to
fly
in
the
face
of
reverent
wisdom
but
to
fly
in
the
face
of
facts
during
a
great
part
of
the
middle
ages
for
instance
it
was
impossible
for
an
educated
man
to
think
of
nature
itself
without
thinking
first
of
what
aristotle
had
said
of
her
aristotle
dicta
were
nature
and
when
benedetti
at
venice
opposed
in
aristotle
opinions
on
violent
and
natural
motion
there
were
hundreds
perhaps
in
the
universities
of
europe
as
there
certainly
were
in
the
days
of
the
immortal
obscurorum
virorum
who
were
ready
in
spite
of
all
benedetti
professed
reverence
for
aristotle
to
accuse
him
of
outraging
not
only
the
father
of
philosophy
but
nature
itself
and
its
palpable
and
notorious
facts
for
the
restoration
of
letters
in
the
fifteenth
century
had
not
at
first
mended
matters
so
strong
was
the
dread
of
nature
in
the
minds
of
the
masses
the
minds
of
men
had
sported
forth
not
toward
any
sound
investigation
of
facts
but
toward
an
eclectic
resuscitation
of
neoplatonism
which
endured
not
without
a
certain
beauty
and
use
as
let
spenser
queen
bear
witness
till
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
after
that
time
a
rapid
change
began
it
is
marked
by
it
has
been
notably
assisted
by
the
foundation
of
our
own
royal
society
its
causes
i
will
not
enter
into
they
are
so
inextricably
mixed
i
hold
with
theological
questions
that
they
can
not
be
discussed
here
i
will
only
point
out
to
you
these
facts
that
from
the
latter
part
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
noblest
heads
and
the
noblest
hearts
of
europe
concentrated
themselves
more
and
more
on
the
brave
and
patient
investigation
of
physical
facts
as
the
source
of
priceless
future
blessings
to
mankind
that
the
eighteenth
century
which
it
has
been
the
fashion
of
late
to
depreciate
did
more
for
the
welfare
of
mankind
in
every
conceivable
direction
than
the
whole
fifteen
centuries
before
it
that
it
did
this
good
work
by
boldly
observing
and
analysing
facts
that
this
boldness
toward
facts
increased
in
proportion
as
europe
became
indoctrinated
with
the
jewish
literature
and
that
notably
such
men
as
kepler
newton
berkeley
spinoza
leibnitz
descartes
in
whatsoever
else
they
differed
agreed
in
this
that
their
attitude
towards
nature
was
derived
from
the
teaching
of
the
jewish
sages
i
believe
that
we
are
not
yet
fully
aware
how
much
we
owe
to
the
jewish
mind
in
the
gradual
emancipation
of
the
human
intellect
the
connection
may
not
of
course
be
one
of
cause
and
effect
it
may
be
a
mere
coincidence
i
believe
it
to
be
a
cause
one
of
course
of
very
many
causes
but
still
an
integral
cause
at
least
the
coincidence
is
too
remarkable
a
fact
not
to
be
worthy
of
investigation
i
said
just
now
the
emancipation
of
the
human
intellect
i
did
not
say
of
science
or
of
the
scientific
intellect
and
for
this
reason
that
the
emancipation
of
science
is
the
emancipation
of
the
common
mind
of
all
men
all
men
can
partake
of
the
gains
of
free
scientific
thought
not
merely
by
enjoying
its
physical
results
but
by
becoming
more
scientific
men
themselves
therefore
it
was
that
though
i
began
my
first
lecture
by
defining
superstition
i
did
not
begin
my
second
by
defining
its
antagonist
science
for
the
word
science
defines
itself
it
means
simply
knowledge
that
is
of
course
right
knowledge
or
such
an
approximation
as
can
be
obtained
knowledge
of
any
natural
object
its
classification
its
causes
its
effects
or
in
plain
english
what
it
is
how
it
came
where
it
is
and
what
can
be
done
with
it
and
scientific
method
likewise
needs
no
definition
for
it
is
simply
the
exercise
of
common
sense
it
is
not
a
peculiar
unique
professional
or
mysterious
process
of
the
understanding
but
the
same
which
all
men
employ
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
in
forming
correct
conclusions
every
one
who
knows
the
philosophic
writings
of
john
stuart
mill
will
be
familiar
with
this
opinion
but
to
those
who
have
no
leisure
to
study
him
i
should
recommend
the
reading
of
professor
huxley
third
lecture
on
the
origin
of
species
in
that
he
shows
with
great
logical
skill
as
well
as
with
some
humour
how
the
man
who
on
rising
in
the
morning
finds
the
parlour
window
open
the
spoons
and
teapot
gone
the
mark
of
a
dirty
hand
on
the
and
that
of
a
boot
outside
and
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
some
one
has
broken
open
the
window
and
stolen
the
plate
arrives
at
that
hypothesis
for
it
is
nothing
more
by
a
long
and
complex
train
of
inductions
and
deductions
of
just
the
same
kind
as
those
which
according
to
the
baconian
philosophy
are
to
be
used
for
investigating
the
deepest
secrets
of
nature
this
is
true
even
of
those
sciences
which
involve
long
mathematical
calculations
in
fact
the
stating
of
the
problem
to
be
solved
is
the
most
important
element
in
the
calculation
and
that
is
so
thoroughly
a
labour
of
common
sense
that
an
utterly
uneducated
man
may
and
often
does
state
an
abstruse
problem
clearly
and
correctly
seeing
what
ought
to
be
proved
and
perhaps
how
to
prove
it
though
he
may
be
unable
to
work
the
problem
out
for
want
of
mathematical
knowledge
but
that
mathematical
knowledge
is
not
as
all
cambridge
men
are
surely
aware
the
result
of
any
special
gift
it
is
merely
the
development
of
those
conceptions
of
form
and
number
which
every
human
being
possesses
and
any
person
of
average
intellect
can
make
himself
a
fair
mathematician
if
he
will
only
pay
continuous
attention
in
plain
english
think
enough
about
the
subject
there
are
sciences
again
which
do
not
involve
mathematical
calculation
for
instance
botany
zoology
geology
which
are
just
now
passing
from
their
old
stage
of
classificatory
sciences
into
the
rank
of
organic
ones
these
are
without
doubt
altogether
within
the
scope
of
the
merest
common
sense
any
man
or
woman
of
average
intellect
if
they
will
but
observe
and
think
for
themselves
freely
boldly
patiently
accurately
may
judge
for
themselves
of
the
conclusions
of
these
sciences
may
add
to
these
conclusions
fresh
and
important
discoveries
and
if
i
am
asked
for
a
proof
of
what
i
assert
i
point
to
and
rivers
written
by
no
professed
scientific
man
but
by
a
colonel
in
the
guards
known
to
fame
only
as
one
of
the
most
perfect
horsemen
in
the
world
let
me
illustrate
my
meaning
by
an
example
a
man
i
do
not
say
a
geologist
but
simply
a
man
squire
or
ploughman
sees
a
small
valley
say
one
of
the
which
open
into
the
larger
valleys
in
the
windsor
forest
district
he
wishes
to
ascertain
its
age
he
has
at
first
sight
a
very
simple
measure
that
of
denudation
he
sees
that
the
glen
is
now
being
eaten
out
by
a
little
stream
the
product
of
innumerable
springs
which
arise
along
its
sides
and
which
are
fed
entirely
by
the
rain
on
the
moors
above
he
finds
on
observation
that
this
stream
brings
down
some
ten
cubic
yards
of
sand
and
gravel
on
an
average
every
year
the
actual
quantity
of
earth
which
has
been
removed
to
make
the
glen
may
be
several
million
cubic
yards
here
is
an
easy
sum
in
arithmetic
at
the
rate
of
ten
cubic
yards
a
year
the
stream
has
taken
several
hundred
thousand
years
to
make
the
glen
you
will
observe
that
this
result
is
obtained
by
mere
common
sense
he
has
a
right
to
assume
that
the
stream
originally
began
the
glen
because
he
finds
it
in
the
act
of
enlarging
it
just
as
much
right
as
he
has
to
assume
if
he
finds
a
hole
in
his
pocket
and
his
last
coin
in
the
act
of
falling
through
it
that
the
rest
of
his
money
has
fallen
through
the
same
hole
it
is
a
sufficient
cause
and
the
simplest
a
number
of
observations
as
to
the
present
rate
of
denudation
and
a
sum
which
any
railroad
contractor
can
do
in
his
head
to
determine
the
solid
contents
of
the
valley
are
all
that
are
needed
the
method
is
that
of
science
but
it
is
also
that
of
simple
common
sense
you
will
remember
therefore
that
this
is
no
mere
theory
or
hypothesis
but
a
pretty
fair
and
simple
conclusion
from
palpable
facts
that
the
probability
lies
with
the
belief
that
the
glen
is
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
old
that
it
is
not
the
observer
business
to
prove
it
further
but
other
to
disprove
it
if
they
can
but
does
the
matter
end
here
no
and
for
certain
reasons
it
is
good
that
it
should
not
end
here
the
observer
if
he
be
a
cautious
man
begins
to
see
if
he
can
disprove
his
own
conclusion
moreover
being
human
he
is
probably
somewhat
awed
if
not
appalled
by
his
own
conclusion
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
spent
in
making
that
little
glen
common
sense
would
say
that
the
longer
it
took
to
make
the
less
wonder
there
was
in
its
being
made
at
last
but
the
instinctive
human
feeling
is
the
opposite
there
is
in
men
and
there
remains
in
them
even
after
they
are
civilised
and
all
other
forms
of
the
dread
of
nature
have
died
out
in
them
a
dread
of
size
of
vast
space
of
vast
time
that
latter
mind
being
always
imagined
as
space
as
we
confess
when
we
speak
instinctively
of
a
space
of
time
they
will
not
understand
that
size
is
merely
a
relative
not
an
absolute
term
that
if
we
were
a
thousand
times
larger
than
we
are
the
universe
would
be
a
thousand
times
smaller
than
it
is
that
if
we
could
think
a
thousand
times
faster
than
we
do
time
would
be
a
thousand
times
longer
than
it
is
that
there
is
one
in
whom
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
to
whom
one
day
is
as
a
thousand
years
and
a
thousand
years
as
one
day
i
believe
this
dread
of
size
to
be
merely
like
all
other
superstitions
a
result
of
bodily
fear
a
development
of
the
instinct
which
makes
a
little
dog
run
away
from
a
big
dog
be
that
as
it
may
every
observer
has
it
and
so
the
man
conclusion
seems
to
him
strange
doubtful
he
will
reconsider
it
moreover
if
he
be
an
experienced
man
he
is
well
aware
that
first
guesses
first
hypotheses
are
not
always
the
right
ones
and
if
he
be
a
modest
man
he
will
consider
the
fact
that
many
thousands
of
thoughtful
men
in
all
ages
and
many
thousands
still
would
say
that
the
glen
can
only
be
a
few
thousand
or
possibly
a
few
hundred
years
old
and
he
will
feel
bound
to
consider
their
opinion
as
far
as
it
is
like
his
own
drawn
from
facts
but
no
further
so
he
casts
about
for
all
other
methods
by
which
the
glen
may
have
been
produced
to
see
if
any
one
of
them
will
account
for
it
in
a
shorter
time
was
it
made
by
an
earthquake
no
for
the
strata
on
both
sides
are
identical
at
the
same
level
and
in
the
same
plane
or
by
a
mighty
current
if
so
the
flood
must
have
run
in
at
the
upper
end
before
it
ran
out
at
the
lower
but
nothing
has
run
in
at
the
upper
end
all
round
above
are
the
undisturbed
gravel
beds
of
the
horizontal
moor
without
channel
or
depression
or
by
water
draining
off
a
vast
flat
as
it
was
upheaved
out
of
the
sea
that
is
a
likely
guess
the
valley
at
its
upper
end
spreads
out
like
the
fingers
of
a
hand
as
the
gullies
in
do
but
that
hypothesis
will
not
stand
there
is
no
vast
unbroken
flat
behind
the
glen
right
and
left
of
it
are
other
similar
glens
parted
from
it
by
long
narrow
ridges
these
also
must
be
explained
on
the
same
hypothesis
but
they
can
not
for
there
could
not
have
been
to
make
them
all
or
a
tenth
of
them
there
are
no
other
possible
hypotheses
and
so
he
must
fall
back
on
the
original
theory
the
rain
the
springs
the
brook
they
have
done
it
all
even
as
they
are
doing
it
this
day
but
is
not
that
still
a
hasty
assumption
may
not
their
denuding
power
have
been
far
greater
in
old
times
than
now
why
should
it
because
there
was
more
rain
then
than
now
that
he
must
put
out
of
court
there
is
no
evidence
of
it
whatsoever
because
the
land
was
more
friable
originally
well
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
that
the
experience
of
every
countryman
tells
him
that
bare
or
fallow
land
is
more
easily
washed
away
than
land
under
vegetation
and
no
doubt
when
these
gravels
and
sands
rose
from
the
sea
they
were
barren
for
hundreds
of
years
he
has
some
measure
of
the
time
required
because
he
can
tell
roughly
how
long
it
takes
for
sands
and
shingles
left
by
the
sea
to
become
covered
with
vegetation
but
he
must
allow
that
the
friability
of
the
land
must
have
been
originally
much
greater
than
now
for
hundreds
of
years
but
again
does
that
fact
really
cut
off
any
great
space
of
time
from
his
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
for
when
the
land
first
rose
from
the
sea
that
glen
was
not
there
some
slight
bay
or
bend
in
the
shore
determined
its
site
that
stream
was
not
there
it
was
split
up
into
a
million
little
springs
oozing
side
by
side
from
the
shore
and
having
each
a
very
minute
denuding
power
which
kept
continually
increasing
by
combination
as
the
glen
ate
its
way
inwards
and
the
rainfall
drained
by
all
these
little
springs
was
collected
into
the
one
central
stream
so
that
when
the
ground
being
bare
was
most
liable
to
be
denuded
the
water
was
least
able
to
do
it
and
as
the
denuding
power
of
the
water
increased
the
land
being
covered
with
vegetation
became
more
and
more
able
to
resist
it
all
this
he
has
seen
going
on
at
the
present
day
in
the
similar
gullies
worn
in
the
soft
strata
of
the
south
hampshire
coast
especially
round
bournemouth
so
the
two
disturbing
elements
in
the
calculation
may
be
fairly
set
off
against
each
other
as
making
a
difference
of
only
a
few
thousands
or
tens
of
thousands
of
years
either
way
and
the
age
of
the
glen
may
fairly
be
if
not
a
million
years
yet
such
a
length
of
years
as
mankind
still
speak
of
with
bated
breath
as
if
forsooth
it
would
do
them
some
harm
i
trust
that
every
scientific
man
in
this
room
will
agree
with
me
that
the
imaginary
squire
or
ploughman
would
have
been
conducting
his
investigation
strictly
according
to
the
laws
of
the
baconian
philosophy
you
will
remark
meanwhile
that
he
has
not
used
a
single
scientific
term
or
referred
to
a
single
scientific
investigation
and
has
observed
nothing
and
thought
nothing
which
might
not
have
been
observed
and
thought
by
any
one
who
chose
to
use
his
common
sense
and
not
to
be
afraid
but
because
he
has
come
round
after
all
this
further
investigation
to
something
very
like
his
first
conclusion
was
all
that
further
investigation
useless
no
a
thousand
times
no
it
is
this
very
verification
of
hypotheses
which
makes
the
sound
ones
safe
and
destroys
the
unsound
it
is
this
struggle
with
all
sorts
of
superstitions
which
makes
science
strong
and
sure
and
her
march
irresistible
winning
ground
slowly
but
never
receding
from
it
it
is
this
buffeting
of
adversity
which
compels
her
not
to
rest
dangerously
upon
the
shallow
sand
of
first
guesses
and
single
observations
but
to
strike
her
roots
down
deep
wide
and
interlaced
into
the
solid
ground
of
actual
facts
it
is
very
necessary
to
insist
on
this
point
for
there
have
been
men
in
all
past
ages
i
do
not
say
whether
there
are
any
such
now
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
will
be
hereafter
men
who
have
tried
to
represent
scientific
method
as
something
difficult
mysterious
peculiar
unique
not
to
be
attained
by
the
unscientific
mass
and
this
not
for
the
purpose
of
exalting
science
but
rather
of
discrediting
her
for
as
long
as
the
masses
educated
or
uneducated
are
ignorant
of
what
scientific
method
is
they
will
look
on
scientific
men
as
the
middle
age
looked
on
necromancers
as
a
privileged
but
awful
and
uncanny
caste
possessed
of
mighty
secrets
who
may
do
them
great
good
but
may
also
do
them
great
harm
which
belief
on
the
part
of
the
masses
will
enable
these
persons
to
instal
themselves
as
the
critics
of
science
though
not
scientific
men
themselves
and
as
shakespeare
has
it
to
talk
of
robin
hood
though
they
never
shot
in
his
bow
thus
they
become
mediators
to
the
masses
between
the
scientific
and
the
unscientific
worlds
they
tell
them
you
are
not
to
trust
the
conclusions
of
men
of
science
at
first
hand
you
are
not
fit
judges
of
their
facts
or
of
their
methods
it
is
we
who
will
by
a
cautious
eclecticism
choose
out
for
you
such
of
their
conclusions
as
are
safe
for
you
and
them
we
will
advise
you
to
believe
to
the
scientific
man
on
the
other
hand
as
often
as
anything
is
discovered
unpleasing
to
them
they
will
say
imperiously
and
e
cathedra
your
new
theory
contradicts
the
established
facts
of
science
for
they
will
know
well
that
whatever
the
men
of
science
think
of
their
assertion
the
masses
will
believe
it
totally
unaware
that
the
speakers
are
by
their
very
terms
showing
their
ignorance
of
science
and
that
what
they
call
established
facts
scientific
men
call
merely
provisional
conclusions
which
they
would
throw
away
without
a
pang
were
the
known
facts
explained
better
by
a
fresh
theory
or
did
fresh
facts
require
one
this
has
happened
too
often
it
is
in
the
interest
of
superstition
that
it
should
happen
again
and
the
best
way
to
prevent
it
surely
is
to
tell
the
masses
scientific
method
is
no
peculiar
mystery
requiring
a
peculiar
initiation
it
is
simply
common
sense
combined
with
uncommon
courage
which
includes
uncommon
honesty
and
uncommon
patience
and
if
you
will
be
brave
honest
patient
and
rational
you
will
need
no
mystagogues
to
tell
you
what
in
science
to
believe
and
what
not
to
believe
for
you
will
be
just
as
good
judges
of
scientific
facts
and
theories
as
those
who
assume
the
right
of
guiding
your
convictions
you
are
men
and
women
and
more
than
that
you
need
not
be
and
let
me
say
that
the
man
of
our
days
whose
writings
exemplify
most
thoroughly
what
i
am
going
to
say
is
the
justly
revered
thomas
carlyle
as
far
as
i
know
he
has
never
written
on
any
scientific
subject
for
aught
i
am
aware
of
he
may
know
nothing
of
mathematics
or
chemistry
of
comparative
anatomy
or
geology
for
aught
i
am
aware
of
he
may
know
a
great
deal
about
them
all
and
like
a
wise
man
hold
his
tongue
and
give
the
world
merely
the
results
in
the
form
of
general
thought
but
this
i
know
that
his
writings
are
instinct
with
the
very
spirit
of
science
that
he
has
taught
men
more
than
any
living
man
the
meaning
and
end
of
science
that
he
has
taught
men
moral
and
intellectual
courage
to
face
facts
boldly
while
they
confess
the
divineness
of
facts
not
to
be
afraid
of
nature
and
not
to
worship
nature
to
believe
that
man
can
know
truth
and
that
only
in
as
far
as
he
knows
truth
can
he
live
worthily
on
this
earth
and
thus
he
has
vindicated
as
no
other
man
in
our
days
has
done
at
once
the
dignity
of
nature
and
the
dignity
of
spirit
that
he
would
have
made
a
distinguished
scientific
man
we
may
be
as
certain
from
his
writings
as
we
may
be
certain
when
we
see
a
fine
old
horse
of
a
certain
stamp
that
he
would
have
made
a
hunter
though
he
has
been
unfortunately
all
his
life
in
harness
therefore
did
i
try
to
train
a
young
man
of
science
to
be
true
devout
and
earnest
accurate
and
daring
i
should
say
read
what
you
will
but
at
least
read
carlyle
it
is
a
small
matter
to
me
and
i
doubt
not
to
him
whether
you
will
agree
with
his
special
conclusions
but
his
premises
and
his
method
are
irrefragable
for
they
stand
on
the
voluntatem
dei
in
rebus
revelatam
on
fact
and
common
sense
and
carlyle
writings
if
i
am
correct
in
my
estimate
of
them
will
afford
a
very
sufficient
answer
to
those
who
think
that
the
scientific
habit
of
mind
tends
to
irreverence
doubtless
this
accusation
will
always
be
brought
against
science
by
those
who
confound
reverence
with
fear
for
from
blind
fear
of
the
unknown
science
does
certainly
deliver
man
she
does
by
man
as
he
does
by
an
unbroken
colt
the
colt
sees
by
the
road
side
some
quite
new
object
a
boot
an
old
kettle
or
what
not
what
a
fearful
monster
what
unknown
terrific
powers
may
it
not
possess
and
the
colt
shies
across
the
road
runs
up
the
bank
rears
on
end
putting
itself
thereby
as
many
a
man
does
in
real
danger
what
cure
is
there
but
one
experience
so
science
takes
us
as
we
should
take
the
colt
gently
by
the
halter
and
makes
us
simply
smell
at
the
new
monster
till
after
a
few
trembling
sniffs
we
discover
like
the
colt
that
it
is
not
a
monster
but
a
kettle
yet
i
think
if
we
sum
up
the
loss
and
gain
we
shall
find
the
colt
character
has
gained
rather
than
lost
by
being
thus
disabused
he
learns
to
substitute
a
very
rational
reverence
for
the
man
who
is
breaking
him
in
for
a
totally
irrational
reverence
for
the
kettle
and
becomes
thereby
a
much
wiser
and
more
useful
member
of
society
as
does
the
man
when
disabused
of
his
superstitions
from
which
follows
one
result
that
if
science
proposes
as
she
does
to
make
men
brave
wise
and
independent
she
must
needs
excite
unpleasant
feelings
in
all
who
desire
to
keep
men
cowardly
ignorant
and
slavish
and
that
too
many
such
persons
have
existed
in
all
ages
is
but
too
notorious
there
have
been
from
all
time
goetai
quacks
powwow
men
and
necromancers
of
various
sorts
who
having
for
their
own
purposes
set
forth
partial
fantastic
and
frightful
interpretations
of
nature
have
no
love
for
those
who
search
after
a
true
exact
brave
and
hopeful
one
and
therefore
it
is
to
be
feared
or
hoped
science
and
superstition
will
to
the
world
end
remain
irreconcilable
and
internecine
foes
conceive
the
feelings
of
an
old
lapland
witch
who
has
had
for
the
last
fifty
years
all
the
winds
in
a
sealskin
bag
and
has
been
selling
fair
breezes
to
northern
skippers
at
so
much
a
puff
asserting
her
powers
so
often
poor
old
soul
that
she
has
got
to
half
believe
them
herself
conceive
i
say
her
feelings
at
seeing
her
customers
watch
the
admiralty
and
con
the
weather
reports
in
the
conceive
the
feelings
of
sir
samuel
baker
african
friend
katchiba
the
chief
who
possessed
a
whole
housefull
of
thunder
and
lightning
though
he
did
not
he
confessed
keep
it
in
a
bottle
as
they
do
in
england
if
sir
samuel
had
had
the
means
and
the
will
of
giving
to
katchiba
negros
a
course
of
lectures
on
electricity
with
appropriate
experiments
and
a
real
bottle
full
of
real
lightning
among
the
foremost
it
is
clear
that
only
two
methods
of
would
have
been
open
to
the
namely
either
to
kill
sir
samuel
or
to
buy
his
real
secret
of
bottling
the
lightning
that
he
might
use
it
for
his
own
ends
the
former
method
that
of
killing
the
man
of
science
was
found
more
easy
in
ancient
times
the
latter
in
these
modern
ones
and
there
have
been
always
those
who
too
to
kill
the
scientific
man
have
patronised
knowledge
not
for
its
own
sake
but
for
the
use
which
may
be
made
of
it
who
would
like
to
keep
a
tame
man
of
science
as
they
would
a
tame
poet
or
a
tame
parrot
who
say
let
us
have
science
by
all
means
but
not
too
much
of
it
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
be
doled
out
to
the
world
like
medicine
in
small
and
cautious
doses
you
the
scientific
man
will
of
course
freely
discover
what
you
choose
only
do
not
talk
too
loudly
about
it
leave
that
to
us
we
understand
the
world
and
are
meant
to
guide
and
govern
it
so
discover
freely
and
meanwhile
hand
over
your
discoveries
to
us
that
we
may
instruct
and
edify
the
populace
with
so
much
of
them
as
we
think
safe
while
we
keep
our
position
thereby
and
in
many
cases
make
much
money
by
your
science
do
that
and
we
will
patronise
you
applaud
you
ask
you
to
our
houses
and
you
shall
be
clothed
in
purple
and
fine
linen
and
fare
sumptuously
with
us
every
day
i
know
not
whether
these
latter
are
not
the
worst
enemies
which
science
has
they
are
often
such
excellent
respectable
orderly
meaning
persons
they
desire
so
sincerely
that
everyone
should
be
wise
only
not
too
wise
they
are
so
utterly
unaware
of
the
mischief
they
are
doing
they
would
recoil
with
horror
if
they
were
told
they
were
so
many
iscariots
betraying
truth
with
a
kiss
but
science
as
yet
has
withstood
both
terrors
and
blandishments
in
old
times
she
endured
being
imprisoned
and
slain
she
came
to
life
again
perhaps
it
was
the
will
of
him
in
whom
all
things
live
that
she
should
live
perhaps
it
was
his
spirit
which
gave
her
life
she
can
endure
too
being
starved
her
votaries
have
not
as
yet
cared
much
for
purple
and
fine
linen
and
sumptuous
fare
there
are
a
very
few
among
them
who
joining
brilliant
talents
to
solid
learning
have
risen
to
deserved
popularity
to
titles
and
to
wealth
but
even
their
labours
it
seems
to
me
are
never
rewarded
in
any
proportion
to
the
time
and
the
intellect
spent
on
them
nor
to
the
benefits
which
they
bring
to
mankind
while
the
great
majority
unpaid
and
unknown
toil
on
and
have
to
find
in
science
her
own
reward
better
perhaps
that
it
should
be
so
better
for
science
that
she
should
be
free
in
holy
poverty
to
go
where
she
will
and
say
what
she
knows
than
that
she
should
be
hired
out
at
so
much
a
year
to
say
things
pleasing
to
the
many
and
to
those
who
guide
the
many
and
so
i
verily
believe
the
majority
of
scientific
men
think
there
are
those
among
them
who
have
obeyed
very
faithfully
paul
precept
no
man
that
warreth
entangleth
himself
with
the
affairs
of
this
life
for
they
have
discovered
that
they
are
engaged
in
a
war
a
veritable
war
against
the
rulers
of
darkness
against
ignorance
and
its
twin
children
fear
and
cruelty
of
that
war
they
see
neither
the
end
nor
even
the
plan
but
they
are
ready
to
go
on
ready
with
socrates
to
follow
reason
withersoever
it
leads
and
content
meanwhile
like
good
soldiers
in
a
campaign
if
they
can
keep
tolerably
in
line
and
use
their
weapons
and
see
a
few
yards
ahead
of
them
through
the
smoke
and
the
woods
they
will
come
out
somewhere
at
last
they
know
not
where
nor
when
but
they
will
come
out
at
last
into
the
daylight
and
the
open
field
and
be
told
then
perhaps
to
their
own
astonishment
as
many
a
gallant
soldier
has
been
told
that
by
simply
walking
straight
on
and
doing
the
duty
which
lay
nearest
them
they
have
helped
to
win
a
great
battle
and
slay
great
giants
earning
the
thanks
of
their
country
and
of
mankind
and
meanwhile
if
they
get
their
shilling
a
day
of
they
are
content
i
had
almost
said
they
ought
to
be
content
for
science
is
i
verily
believe
like
virtue
its
own
exceeding
great
reward
i
can
conceive
few
human
states
more
enviable
than
that
of
the
man
to
whom
panting
in
the
foul
laboratory
or
watching
for
his
life
under
the
tropic
forest
isis
shall
for
a
moment
lift
her
sacred
veil
and
show
him
once
and
for
ever
the
thing
he
dreamed
not
of
some
law
or
even
mere
hint
of
a
law
explaining
one
fact
but
explaining
with
it
a
thousand
more
connecting
them
all
with
each
other
and
with
the
mighty
whole
till
order
and
meaning
shoots
through
some
old
chaos
of
scattered
observations
is
not
that
a
joy
a
prize
which
wealth
can
not
give
nor
poverty
take
away
what
it
may
lead
to
he
knows
not
of
what
use
it
may
become
he
knows
not
but
this
he
knows
that
somewhere
it
must
lead
of
some
use
it
will
be
for
it
is
a
truth
and
having
found
a
truth
he
has
exorcised
one
more
of
the
ghosts
which
haunt
humanity
he
has
left
one
object
less
for
man
to
fear
one
object
more
for
man
to
use
yes
the
scientific
man
may
have
this
comfort
that
whatever
he
has
done
he
has
done
good
that
he
is
following
a
mistress
who
has
never
yet
conferred
aught
but
benefits
on
the
human
race
what
physical
science
may
do
hereafter
i
know
not
but
as
yet
she
has
done
this
she
has
enormously
increased
the
wealth
of
the
human
race
and
has
therefore
given
employment
food
existence
to
millions
who
without
science
would
either
have
starved
or
have
never
been
born
she
has
shown
that
the
dictum
of
the
early
political
economists
that
population
has
a
tendency
to
increase
faster
than
the
means
of
subsistence
is
no
law
of
humanity
but
merely
a
tendency
of
the
barbaric
and
ignorant
man
which
can
be
counteracted
by
increasing
manifold
by
scientific
means
his
powers
of
producing
food
she
has
taught
men
during
the
last
few
years
to
foresee
and
elude
the
most
destructive
storms
and
there
is
no
reason
for
doubting
and
many
reasons
for
hoping
that
she
will
gradually
teach
men
to
elude
other
terrific
forces
of
nature
too
powerful
and
too
seemingly
capricious
for
them
to
conquer
she
has
discovered
innumerable
remedies
and
alleviations
for
pains
and
disease
she
has
thrown
such
light
on
the
causes
of
epidemics
that
we
are
able
to
say
now
that
the
presence
of
cholera
and
probably
of
all
zymotic
diseases
in
any
place
is
usually
a
sin
and
a
shame
for
which
the
owners
and
authorities
of
that
place
ought
to
be
punishable
by
law
as
destroyers
of
their
men
while
for
the
weak
for
those
who
in
the
barbarous
and
state
and
out
of
that
last
we
are
only
just
emerging
how
much
has
she
done
an
earnest
of
much
more
which
she
will
do
she
has
delivered
the
insane
i
may
say
by
the
scientific
insight
of
one
man
more
worthy
of
titles
and
pensions
than
of
those
who
earn
them
i
mean
the
great
and
good
pinel
from
hopeless
misery
and
torture
into
comparative
peace
and
comfort
and
at
least
the
possibility
of
cure
for
children
she
has
done
much
or
rather
might
do
would
parents
read
and
perpend
such
books
as
andrew
combe
and
those
of
other
writers
on
physical
education
we
should
not
then
see
the
children
even
of
the
rich
done
to
death
piecemeal
by
improper
food
improper
clothes
neglect
of
ventilation
and
the
commonest
measures
for
preserving
health
we
should
not
see
their
intellects
stunted
by
procrustean
attempts
to
teach
them
all
the
same
accomplishments
to
the
neglect
most
often
of
any
sound
practical
training
of
their
faculties
we
should
not
see
slight
indigestion
or
temporary
rushes
of
blood
to
the
head
condemned
and
punished
as
sins
against
him
who
took
up
little
children
in
his
arms
and
blessed
them
but
we
may
have
hope
when
we
compare
education
now
with
what
it
was
even
forty
years
ago
much
more
with
the
stupid
brutality
of
the
monastic
system
we
may
hail
for
children
as
well
as
for
grown
people
the
advent
of
the
reign
of
common
sense
and
for
woman
what
might
i
not
say
on
that
point
but
most
of
it
would
be
fitly
discussed
only
among
physicians
and
biologists
here
i
will
say
only
this
science
has
exterminated
at
least
among
civilised
nations
women
at
least
white
women
are
no
longer
tortured
or
burnt
alive
from
man
blind
fear
of
the
unknown
if
science
had
done
no
more
than
that
she
would
deserve
the
perpetual
thanks
and
the
perpetual
trust
not
only
of
the
women
whom
she
has
preserved
from
agony
but
the
men
whom
she
has
preserved
from
crime
these
benefits
have
already
accrued
to
civilised
men
because
they
have
lately
allowed
a
very
few
of
their
number
peaceably
to
imitate
rarey
and
find
out
what
nature
or
rather
to
speak
at
once
reverently
and
accurately
he
who
made
nature
is
thinking
of
and
obey
the
voluntatem
dei
in
rebus
revelatam
this
science
has
done
while
yet
in
her
infancy
what
she
will
do
in
her
maturity
who
dare
predict
at
least
in
the
face
of
such
facts
as
these
those
who
bid
us
fear
or
restrain
or
mutilate
science
bid
us
commit
an
act
of
folly
as
well
as
of
ingratitude
which
can
only
harm
ourselves
for
science
has
as
yet
done
nothing
but
good
will
any
one
tell
me
what
harm
it
has
ever
done
when
any
one
will
show
me
a
single
result
of
science
of
the
knowledge
of
and
use
of
physical
facts
which
has
not
tended
directly
to
the
benefit
of
mankind
moral
and
spiritual
as
well
as
physical
and
economic
then
i
shall
be
tempted
to
believe
that
solomon
was
wrong
when
he
said
that
the
one
thing
to
be
sought
after
on
earth
more
precious
than
all
treasure
she
who
has
length
of
days
in
her
right
hand
and
in
her
left
hand
riches
and
honour
whose
ways
are
ways
of
pleasantness
and
all
her
paths
are
peace
who
is
a
tree
of
life
to
all
who
lay
hold
on
her
and
makes
happy
every
one
who
retains
her
is
as
you
will
see
if
you
will
yourselves
consult
the
passage
that
very
wisdom
by
which
god
has
founded
the
earth
and
that
very
understanding
by
which
he
has
established
the
heavens
grots
and
groves
i
wish
this
lecture
to
be
suggestive
rather
that
didactic
to
set
you
thinking
and
inquiring
for
yourselves
rather
than
learning
at
hand
from
me
some
among
my
audience
i
doubt
not
will
neither
need
to
be
taught
by
me
nor
to
be
stirred
up
to
inquiry
for
themselves
they
are
already
probably
antiquarians
already
better
acquainted
with
the
subject
than
i
am
they
come
hither
therefore
as
critics
i
trust
not
as
unkindly
critics
they
will
i
hope
remember
that
i
am
trying
to
excite
a
general
interest
in
that
very
architecture
in
which
they
delight
and
so
to
make
the
public
do
justice
to
their
labours
they
will
therefore
i
trust
be
to
my
faults
a
little
blind
be
to
my
virtues
very
kind
and
if
my
architectural
theories
do
not
seem
to
them
correct
in
all
details
i
believe
them
myself
to
be
remember
that
it
is
a
slight
matter
to
me
or
to
the
audience
whether
any
special
and
pet
fancy
of
mine
should
be
exactly
true
or
not
but
it
is
not
a
light
matter
that
my
hearers
should
be
awakened
and
too
many
just
now
need
an
actual
awakening
to
a
right
pure
and
wholesome
judgment
on
questions
of
art
especially
when
the
soundness
of
that
judgment
depends
as
in
this
case
on
sound
judgments
about
human
history
as
well
as
about
natural
objects
now
it
befel
me
that
fresh
from
the
tropic
forests
and
with
their
forms
hanging
always
as
it
were
in
the
background
of
my
eye
i
was
impressed
more
and
more
vividly
the
longer
i
looked
with
the
likeness
of
those
forest
forms
to
the
forms
of
our
own
cathedral
of
chester
the
grand
and
graceful
transformed
itself
into
one
of
those
green
bowers
which
once
seen
and
never
to
be
seen
again
make
one
at
once
richer
and
poorer
for
the
rest
of
life
the
fans
of
groining
sprang
from
the
short
columns
just
as
do
the
feathered
boughs
of
the
far
more
beautiful
maximiliana
palm
and
just
of
the
same
size
and
shape
and
met
overhead
as
i
have
seen
them
meet
in
aisles
longer
by
far
than
our
cathedral
nave
the
free
upright
shafts
which
give
such
strength
and
yet
such
lightness
to
the
mullions
of
each
window
pierced
upward
through
those
curving
lines
as
do
the
stems
of
young
trees
through
the
fronds
of
palm
and
like
them
carried
the
eye
and
the
fancy
up
into
the
infinite
and
took
off
a
sense
of
oppression
and
captivity
which
the
weight
of
the
roof
might
have
produced
in
the
nave
in
the
choir
the
same
vision
of
the
tropic
forest
haunted
me
the
fluted
columns
not
only
resembled
but
seemed
copied
from
the
fluted
stems
beneath
which
i
had
ridden
in
the
primeval
woods
their
bases
their
capitals
seemed
copied
from
the
bulgings
at
the
collar
of
the
root
and
at
the
spring
of
the
boughs
produced
by
a
check
of
the
redundant
sap
and
were
garlanded
often
enough
like
the
capitals
of
the
columns
with
delicate
tracery
of
parasite
leaves
and
flowers
the
mouldings
of
the
arches
seemed
copied
from
the
parallel
bundles
of
the
curving
bamboo
shoots
and
even
the
flatter
roof
of
the
nave
and
transepts
had
its
antitype
in
that
highest
level
of
the
forest
aisles
where
the
trees
having
climbed
at
last
to
the
which
they
seek
care
no
longer
to
grow
upward
but
spread
out
in
huge
limbs
almost
horizontal
reminding
the
eye
of
the
arch
which
marks
the
period
of
perpendicular
gothic
nay
to
this
day
there
is
one
point
in
our
cathedral
which
to
me
keeps
up
the
illusion
still
as
i
enter
the
choir
and
look
upward
toward
the
left
i
can
not
help
seeing
in
the
tabernacle
work
of
the
stalls
the
slender
and
aspiring
forms
of
the
rastrajo
the
delicate
second
growth
which
as
it
were
rushes
upward
from
the
earth
wherever
the
forest
is
cleared
and
above
it
in
the
tall
lines
of
the
pier
of
the
tower
even
though
defaced
along
the
inner
face
of
the
western
arch
by
ugly
and
needless
perpendicular
panelling
i
seem
to
see
the
stems
of
huge
cedars
or
balatas
or
ceibas
curving
over
as
they
would
do
into
the
great
beams
of
the
transept
roof
some
seventy
feet
above
the
ground
nay
so
far
will
the
fancy
lead
that
i
have
seemed
to
see
in
the
stained
glass
between
the
tracery
of
the
windows
such
gorgeous
sheets
of
colour
as
sometimes
flash
on
the
eye
when
far
aloft
between
high
stems
and
boughs
you
catch
sight
of
some
great
tree
ablaze
with
flowers
either
its
own
or
those
of
a
parasite
yellow
or
crimson
white
or
purple
and
over
them
again
the
cloudless
blue
now
i
know
well
that
all
these
dreams
are
dreams
that
the
men
who
built
our
northern
cathedrals
never
saw
these
forest
forms
and
that
the
likeness
of
their
work
to
those
of
tropic
nature
is
at
most
only
a
corroboration
of
ruskin
dictum
that
the
gothic
did
not
arise
out
of
but
developed
itself
into
a
resemblance
to
it
was
no
chance
suggestion
of
the
form
of
an
arch
from
the
bending
of
a
bough
but
the
gradual
and
continual
discovery
of
a
beauty
in
natural
forms
which
could
be
more
and
more
transferred
into
those
of
stone
which
influenced
at
once
the
hearts
of
the
people
and
the
form
of
the
edifice
so
true
is
this
that
by
a
pure
and
noble
copying
of
the
vegetable
beauty
which
they
had
seen
in
their
own
clime
the
medieval
craftsmen
went
so
far
as
i
have
shown
you
as
to
anticipate
forms
of
vegetable
beauty
peculiar
to
tropic
climes
which
they
had
not
seen
a
fresh
proof
if
proof
were
needed
that
beauty
is
something
absolute
and
independent
of
man
and
not
as
some
think
only
relative
and
what
happens
to
be
pleasant
to
the
eye
of
this
man
or
that
but
thinking
over
this
matter
and
reading
over
too
that
which
ruskin
has
written
thereon
in
his
of
venice
vol
ii
cap
on
the
nature
of
gothic
i
came
to
certain
further
conclusions
or
at
least
surmises
which
i
put
before
you
in
hopes
that
if
they
have
no
other
effect
on
you
they
will
at
least
stir
some
of
you
up
to
read
ruskin
works
now
ruskin
says
that
the
original
conception
of
gothic
architecture
has
been
derived
from
vegetation
from
the
symmetry
of
avenues
and
the
interlacing
of
branches
is
a
strange
and
vain
supposition
it
is
a
theory
which
never
could
have
existed
for
a
moment
in
the
mind
of
any
person
acquainted
with
early
gothic
but
however
idle
as
a
theory
it
is
most
valuable
as
a
testimony
to
the
character
of
the
perfected
style
doubtless
so
but
you
must
remember
always
that
the
subject
of
my
lecture
is
grots
and
groves
that
i
am
speaking
not
of
gothic
architecture
in
general
but
of
gothic
ecclesiastical
architecture
and
more
almost
exclusively
of
the
ecclesiastical
architecture
of
the
teutonic
or
northern
nations
because
in
them
as
i
think
the
resemblance
between
the
temple
and
the
forest
reached
the
fullest
exactness
now
the
original
idea
of
a
christian
church
was
that
of
a
grot
a
cave
that
is
a
historic
fact
the
christianity
which
was
passed
on
to
us
began
to
worship
hidden
and
persecuted
in
the
catacombs
of
rome
it
may
be
often
around
the
martyrs
tombs
by
the
dim
light
of
candle
or
of
torch
the
candles
on
the
roman
altars
whatever
they
have
been
made
to
symbolise
since
then
are
the
hereditary
memorials
of
that
fact
throughout
the
north
in
these
isles
as
much
as
in
any
land
the
idea
of
the
grot
was
in
like
wise
the
idea
of
a
church
the
saint
or
hermit
built
himself
a
cell
dark
massive
intended
to
exclude
light
as
well
as
weather
or
took
refuge
in
a
cave
there
he
prayed
and
worshipped
and
gathered
others
to
pray
and
worship
round
him
during
his
life
there
he
often
enough
became
an
object
of
worship
in
his
turn
after
his
death
in
after
ages
his
cave
was
ornamented
like
that
of
the
hermit
of
montmajour
by
arles
or
his
enlarged
as
those
of
the
scotch
and
irish
saints
have
been
again
and
again
till
at
last
a
stately
minster
rose
above
it
still
the
idea
that
the
church
was
to
be
a
grot
haunted
the
minds
of
builders
but
side
by
side
with
the
christian
grot
there
was
throughout
the
north
another
form
of
temple
dedicated
to
very
different
gods
namely
the
trees
from
whose
mighty
stems
hung
the
heads
of
the
victims
of
odin
or
of
thor
the
horse
the
goat
and
in
time
of
calamity
or
pestilence
of
men
trees
and
not
grots
were
the
temples
of
our
forefathers
scholars
know
well
but
they
must
excuse
my
quoting
it
for
the
sake
of
those
who
are
not
scholars
the
famous
passage
of
tacitus
which
tells
how
our
forefathers
held
it
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
gods
to
coop
them
within
walls
or
liken
them
to
any
human
countenance
but
consecrated
groves
and
woods
and
called
by
the
name
of
gods
that
mystery
which
they
held
by
faith
alone
and
the
equally
famous
passage
of
claudian
about
the
vast
silence
of
the
black
forest
and
groves
awful
with
ancient
superstition
and
oaks
barbarian
deities
and
lucan
groves
inviolate
from
all
antiquity
and
altars
stained
with
human
blood
to
worship
in
such
spots
was
an
abomination
to
the
early
christian
it
was
as
much
a
test
of
heathendom
as
the
eating
of
sacred
to
odin
and
therefore
unclean
to
christian
men
the
lombard
laws
and
others
forbid
expressly
the
lingering
remnants
of
grove
worship
boniface
and
other
early
missionaries
hewed
down
in
defiance
the
sacred
oaks
and
paid
sometimes
for
their
valour
with
their
lives
it
is
no
wonder
then
if
long
centuries
elapsed
ere
the
likeness
of
vegetable
forms
began
to
reappear
in
the
christian
churches
of
the
north
and
yet
both
grot
and
grove
were
equally
the
natural
temples
which
the
religious
instinct
of
all
peoples
conscious
of
sin
and
conscious
too
of
yearnings
after
a
perfection
not
to
be
found
on
earth
chooses
from
the
earliest
stage
of
awakening
civilisation
in
them
alone
before
he
had
strength
and
skill
to
build
nobly
for
himself
could
man
find
darkness
the
mother
of
mystery
and
awe
in
which
he
is
reminded
perforce
of
his
own
ignorance
and
weakness
in
which
he
learns
first
to
remember
unseen
powers
sometimes
to
his
comfort
and
elevation
sometimes
only
to
his
terror
and
debasement
darkness
and
with
it
silence
and
solitude
in
which
he
can
collect
himself
and
shut
out
the
noise
and
glare
the
meanness
and
the
coarseness
of
the
world
and
be
alone
a
while
with
his
own
thoughts
his
own
fancy
his
own
conscience
his
own
soul
but
for
a
while
as
i
have
said
that
darkness
solitude
and
silence
were
to
be
sought
in
the
grot
not
in
the
grove
then
christianity
conquered
the
empire
it
adapted
not
merely
its
architecture
but
its
very
buildings
to
its
worship
the
roman
basilica
became
the
christian
church
a
noble
form
of
building
enough
though
one
in
which
was
neither
darkness
solitude
nor
silence
but
crowded
congregations
clapping
or
otherwise
the
popular
preacher
or
fighting
about
the
election
of
a
bishop
or
a
pope
till
the
holy
place
ran
with
christian
blood
the
northern
turned
away
in
weariness
and
disgust
from
those
vast
halls
fitted
only
for
the
feverish
superstition
of
a
profligate
and
civilisation
and
took
himself
amid
his
own
rocks
and
forests
moors
and
shores
to
a
simpler
and
sterner
architecture
which
should
express
a
creed
sterner
and
at
heart
far
simpler
though
dogmatically
the
same
and
this
is
to
my
mind
the
difference
and
the
noble
difference
between
the
norman
architecture
which
came
hither
about
the
time
of
the
conquest
and
that
of
romanized
italy
but
the
normans
were
a
conquering
race
and
one
which
conquered
be
it
always
remembered
in
england
at
least
in
the
name
and
by
the
authority
of
rome
their
ecclesiastics
like
the
ecclesiastics
on
the
continent
were
the
representatives
of
roman
civilisation
of
rome
right
intellectual
and
spiritual
to
rule
the
world
therefore
their
architecture
like
their
creed
was
roman
they
took
the
massive
towering
roman
forms
which
expressed
domination
and
piled
them
one
on
the
other
to
express
the
domination
of
christian
rome
over
the
souls
as
they
had
represented
the
domination
of
heathen
rome
over
the
bodies
of
men
and
so
side
by
side
with
the
towers
of
the
norman
keep
rose
the
towers
of
the
norman
cathedral
the
two
signs
of
a
double
servitude
but
with
the
thirteenth
century
there
dawned
an
age
in
northern
europe
which
i
may
boldly
call
an
heroic
age
heroic
in
its
virtues
and
in
its
crimes
an
age
of
rich
passionate
youth
or
rather
of
early
manhood
full
of
aspirations
of
chivalry
of
as
strange
and
terrible
as
it
was
beautiful
and
noble
even
when
most
misguided
the
teutonic
nations
of
europe
our
own
forefathers
most
of
all
having
absorbed
all
that
heathen
rome
could
teach
them
at
least
for
the
time
being
began
to
think
for
themselves
to
have
poets
philosophers
historians
architects
of
their
own
the
thirteenth
century
was
especially
an
age
of
aspiration
and
its
architects
expressed
in
buildings
quite
unlike
those
of
the
preceding
centuries
the
aspirations
of
the
time
the
pointed
arch
had
been
introduced
half
a
century
before
it
may
be
that
the
crusaders
saw
it
in
the
east
and
brought
it
home
it
may
be
that
it
originated
from
the
quadripartite
vaulting
of
the
normans
the
segmental
groins
of
which
crossing
diagonally
produced
to
appearance
the
pointed
arch
it
may
be
that
it
was
derived
from
that
mystical
figure
of
a
pointed
oval
form
the
vesica
piscis
it
may
be
lastly
that
it
was
suggested
simply
by
the
intersection
of
semicircular
arches
so
frequently
found
in
ornamental
arcades
the
last
cause
may
perhaps
be
the
true
one
but
it
matters
little
whence
the
pointed
arch
came
it
matters
much
what
it
meant
to
those
who
introduced
it
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
transition
or
period
it
seems
to
have
meant
nothing
it
was
not
till
the
thirteenth
century
that
it
had
gradually
received
as
it
were
a
soul
and
had
become
the
exponent
of
a
great
idea
as
the
norman
architecture
and
its
forms
had
signified
domination
so
the
early
english
as
we
call
it
signified
aspiration
an
idea
which
was
perfected
as
far
as
it
could
be
in
what
we
call
the
decorated
style
there
is
an
evident
gap
i
had
almost
said
a
gulf
between
the
architectural
mind
of
the
eleventh
and
that
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
vertical
tendency
a
longing
after
lightness
and
freedom
appears
and
with
them
a
longing
to
reproduce
the
graces
of
nature
and
art
and
here
i
ask
you
to
look
for
yourselves
at
the
buildings
of
this
new
era
there
is
a
beautiful
specimen
in
yonder
arcade
and
judge
for
yourselves
whether
they
and
even
more
than
they
the
decorated
style
into
which
they
developed
do
not
remind
you
of
the
forest
shapes
and
if
they
remind
you
must
they
not
have
reminded
those
who
shaped
them
can
it
have
been
otherwise
we
know
that
the
men
who
built
were
earnest
the
carefulness
the
reverence
of
their
work
have
given
a
subject
for
some
of
ruskin
noblest
chapters
a
text
for
some
of
his
noblest
sermons
we
know
that
they
were
students
of
vegetable
form
that
is
proved
by
the
flowers
the
leaves
even
the
birds
with
which
they
enwreathed
their
capitals
and
enriched
their
mouldings
look
up
there
and
see
you
can
not
look
at
any
good
from
the
thirteenth
to
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
without
seeing
that
leaves
and
flowers
were
perpetually
in
the
workman
mind
do
you
fancy
that
stems
and
boughs
were
never
in
his
mind
he
kept
doubtless
in
remembrance
the
fundamental
idea
that
the
christian
church
should
symbolise
a
grot
or
cave
he
could
do
no
less
while
he
again
and
again
saw
hermits
around
him
dwelling
and
worshipping
in
caves
as
they
had
done
ages
before
in
egypt
and
syria
while
he
fixed
again
and
again
the
site
of
his
convent
and
his
minster
in
some
secluded
valley
guarded
by
cliffs
and
rocks
like
vale
crucis
in
north
wales
but
his
minster
stood
often
not
among
rocks
only
but
amid
trees
in
some
clearing
in
the
primeval
forest
as
vale
crucis
was
then
at
least
he
could
not
pass
from
minster
to
minster
from
town
to
town
without
journeying
through
long
miles
of
forest
do
you
think
that
the
awful
shapes
and
shadows
of
that
forest
never
haunted
his
imagination
as
he
built
he
would
have
cut
down
ruthlessly
as
his
predecessors
the
early
missionaries
did
the
sacred
trees
amid
which
thor
and
odin
had
been
worshipped
by
the
heathen
saxons
amid
which
still
darker
deities
were
still
worshipped
by
the
heathen
tribes
of
eastern
europe
but
he
was
the
descendant
of
men
who
had
worshipped
in
those
groves
and
the
glamour
of
them
was
upon
him
still
he
peopled
the
wild
forest
with
demons
and
fairies
but
that
did
not
surely
prevent
his
feeling
its
ennobling
grandeur
its
chastening
loneliness
his
ancestors
had
held
the
oaks
for
trees
of
god
even
as
the
jews
held
the
cedar
and
the
hindoos
likewise
for
the
deodara
pine
is
not
only
botanists
tell
us
the
same
as
the
cedar
of
lebanon
but
its
very
name
the
deodara
signifies
nought
else
but
the
tree
of
god
his
ancestors
i
say
had
held
the
oaks
for
trees
of
god
it
may
be
that
as
the
monk
sat
beneath
their
shade
with
his
bible
on
his
knee
like
good
boniface
in
the
fulda
forest
he
found
that
his
ancestors
were
right
to
understand
what
sort
of
trees
they
were
from
which
he
got
his
inspiration
you
must
look
not
at
an
average
english
wood
perpetually
thinned
out
as
the
trees
arrive
at
middle
age
still
less
must
you
look
at
the
pines
oaks
beeches
of
an
english
park
where
each
tree
has
had
space
to
develop
itself
freely
into
a
more
or
less
rounded
form
you
must
not
even
look
at
the
tropic
forests
for
there
from
the
immense
diversity
of
forms
twenty
varieties
of
tree
will
grow
beneath
each
other
forming
a
heap
of
boughs
and
leaves
from
the
ground
to
a
hundred
feet
and
more
aloft
you
should
look
at
the
north
american
forests
of
social
trees
especially
of
pines
and
firs
where
trees
of
one
species
crowded
together
and
competing
with
equal
advantages
for
the
air
and
light
form
themselves
into
one
wilderness
of
straight
smooth
shafts
surmounted
by
a
flat
sheet
of
foliage
held
up
by
boughs
like
the
ribs
of
a
groined
roof
while
underneath
the
ground
is
bare
as
a
cathedral
floor
you
all
know
surely
the
hemlock
spruce
of
america
which
while
growing
by
itself
in
open
ground
is
the
most
wilful
and
fantastic
as
well
as
the
most
graceful
of
all
the
firs
imitating
the
shape
not
of
its
kindred
but
of
an
enormous
tuft
of
fern
yet
if
you
look
at
the
same
tree
when
it
has
struggled
long
for
life
from
its
youth
amid
other
trees
of
its
own
kind
and
its
own
age
you
find
that
the
lower
boughs
have
died
off
from
want
of
light
leaving
not
a
scar
behind
the
upper
boughs
have
reached
at
once
the
light
and
their
natural
term
of
years
they
are
content
to
live
and
little
more
the
central
trunk
no
longer
sends
up
each
year
a
fresh
perpendicular
shoot
to
aspire
above
the
rest
but
as
weary
of
struggling
ambition
as
they
are
is
content
to
become
more
and
more
their
equal
as
the
years
pass
by
and
this
is
a
law
of
social
forest
trees
which
you
must
bear
in
mind
whenever
i
speak
of
the
influence
of
on
gothic
architecture
such
forms
as
these
are
rare
enough
in
europe
now
i
never
understood
how
possible
how
common
they
must
have
been
in
medieval
europe
till
i
saw
in
the
forest
of
fontainebleau
a
few
oaks
like
the
oak
of
charlemagne
and
the
bouquet
du
roi
at
whose
age
i
dare
not
guess
but
whose
size
and
shape
showed
them
to
have
once
formed
part
of
a
continuous
wood
the
like
whereof
remains
not
in
these
isles
perhaps
not
east
of
the
carpathian
mountains
in
them
a
clear
shaft
of
at
least
sixty
it
may
be
eighty
feet
carries
a
flat
head
of
boughs
each
in
itself
a
tree
in
such
a
grove
i
thought
the
heathen
gaul
even
the
heathen
frank
worshipped
beneath
trees
of
god
such
trees
i
thought
centuries
after
inspired
the
genius
of
every
builder
of
gothic
aisles
and
roofs
thus
at
least
we
can
explain
that
rigidity
which
ruskin
tells
us
is
a
special
element
of
gothic
architecture
greek
and
egyptian
buildings
he
says
and
i
should
have
added
roman
buildings
also
in
proportion
to
their
age
to
the
amount
of
the
roman
elements
in
them
stand
for
the
most
part
by
their
own
weight
and
mass
one
stone
passively
incumbent
on
another
but
in
the
gothic
vaults
and
traceries
there
is
a
stiffness
analogous
to
that
of
the
bones
of
a
limb
or
fibres
of
a
tree
an
elastic
tension
and
communication
of
force
from
part
to
part
and
also
a
studious
expression
of
this
throughout
every
part
of
the
building
in
a
word
gothic
vaulting
and
tracery
have
been
studiously
made
like
to
boughs
of
trees
were
those
boughs
present
to
the
mind
of
the
architect
or
is
the
coincidence
merely
fortuitous
you
know
already
how
i
should
answer
the
cusped
arch
too
was
it
actually
not
intended
to
imitate
vegetation
ruskin
seems
to
think
so
he
says
that
it
is
merely
the
special
application
to
the
arch
of
the
great
ornamental
system
of
foliation
which
whether
simple
as
in
the
cusped
arch
or
complicated
as
in
tracery
arose
out
of
the
love
of
leafage
not
that
the
form
of
the
arch
is
intended
to
imitate
a
leaf
but
to
be
invested
with
the
same
characters
of
beauty
which
the
designer
had
discovered
in
the
leaf
now
i
differ
from
ruskin
with
extreme
hesitation
i
agree
that
the
cusped
arch
is
not
meant
to
imitate
a
leaf
i
think
with
ruskin
that
it
was
probably
first
adopted
on
account
of
its
superior
strength
and
that
it
afterwards
took
the
form
of
a
bough
but
i
can
not
as
yet
believe
that
it
was
not
at
last
intended
to
imitate
a
bough
a
bough
of
a
very
common
form
and
one
in
which
active
rigidity
is
peculiarly
shown
i
mean
a
bough
which
has
forked
if
the
lower
fork
has
died
off
for
want
of
light
we
obtain
something
like
the
simply
cusped
arch
if
it
be
still
living
but
short
and
stunted
in
comparison
with
the
higher
fork
we
obtain
it
seems
to
me
something
like
the
foliated
cusp
both
likenesses
being
near
enough
to
those
of
common
objects
to
make
it
possible
that
those
objects
may
have
suggested
them
and
thus
more
and
more
boldly
the
mediaeval
architect
learnt
to
copy
boughs
stems
and
at
last
the
whole
effect
as
far
always
as
stone
would
allow
of
a
combination
of
rock
and
tree
of
grot
and
grove
so
he
formed
his
minsters
as
i
believe
upon
the
model
of
those
leafy
minsters
in
which
he
walked
to
meditate
amid
the
aisles
which
god
not
man
has
built
he
sent
their
columns
aloft
like
the
boles
of
ancient
trees
he
wreathed
their
capitals
sometimes
their
very
shafts
with
flowers
and
creeping
shoots
he
threw
their
arches
out
and
interwove
the
groinings
of
their
vaults
like
the
overhead
he
decked
with
foliage
and
fruit
the
bosses
above
and
the
corbels
below
he
sent
up
out
of
those
corbels
upright
shafts
along
the
walls
in
the
likeness
of
the
trees
which
sprang
out
of
the
rocks
above
his
head
he
raised
those
walls
into
great
cliffs
he
pierced
them
with
the
arches
of
the
triforium
as
with
hermits
cells
he
represented
in
the
horizontal
sills
of
his
windows
and
in
his
horizontal
the
horizontal
strata
of
the
rocks
he
opened
the
windows
into
high
and
lofty
glades
broken
as
in
the
forest
by
the
tracery
of
stems
and
boughs
through
which
was
seen
not
merely
the
outer
but
the
upper
world
for
he
craved
as
all
true
artists
crave
for
light
and
colour
and
had
the
sky
above
been
one
perpetual
blue
he
might
have
been
content
with
it
and
left
his
glass
transparent
but
in
that
dark
dank
northern
clime
rain
and
snowstorm
black
cloud
and
grey
mist
were
all
that
he
was
like
to
see
outside
for
nine
months
in
the
year
so
he
took
such
light
and
colour
as
nature
gave
in
her
few
gayer
moods
and
set
aloft
his
stained
glass
windows
the
hues
of
the
noonday
and
the
rainbow
and
the
sunrise
and
the
sunset
and
the
purple
of
the
heather
and
the
gold
of
the
gorse
and
the
azure
of
the
bugloss
and
the
crimson
of
the
poppy
and
among
them
in
gorgeous
robes
the
angels
and
the
saints
of
heaven
and
the
memories
of
heroic
virtues
and
heroic
sufferings
that
he
might
lift
up
his
own
eyes
and
heart
for
ever
out
of
the
dark
dank
sad
world
of
the
cold
north
with
all
its
coarsenesses
and
its
crimes
toward
a
realm
of
perpetual
holiness
amid
a
perpetual
summer
of
beauty
and
of
light
as
one
who
for
he
was
true
to
nature
even
in
that
from
between
the
black
jaws
of
a
narrow
glen
or
from
beneath
the
black
shade
of
gnarled
trees
catches
a
glimpse
of
far
lands
gay
with
gardens
and
cottages
and
purple
mountain
ranges
and
the
far
off
sea
and
the
hazy
horizon
melting
into
the
hazy
sky
and
finds
his
heart
carried
out
into
an
infinite
at
once
of
freedom
and
of
repose
and
so
out
of
the
cliffs
and
the
forests
he
shaped
the
inside
of
his
church
and
how
did
he
shape
the
outside
look
for
yourselves
and
judge
but
look
not
at
chester
but
at
salisbury
look
at
those
churches
which
carry
not
mere
towers
but
spires
or
at
least
pinnacled
towers
approaching
the
pyrmidal
form
the
outside
form
of
every
gothic
cathedral
must
be
considered
imperfect
if
it
does
not
culminate
in
something
pyramidal
the
especial
want
of
all
greek
and
roman
buildings
with
which
we
are
acquainted
is
the
absence
save
in
a
few
and
unimportant
cases
of
the
pyramidal
form
the
egyptians
knew
at
least
the
worth
of
the
obelisk
but
the
greeks
and
romans
hardly
knew
even
that
their
buildings
are
topped
their
builders
were
contented
with
the
earth
as
it
was
there
was
a
great
truth
involved
in
that
which
i
am
the
last
to
deny
but
religions
which
like
the
buddhist
or
the
christian
nurse
a
noble
discontent
are
sure
to
adopt
sooner
or
later
an
upward
and
aspiring
form
of
building
it
is
not
merely
that
fancying
heaven
to
be
above
earth
they
point
towards
heaven
there
is
a
deeper
natural
language
in
the
pyramidal
form
of
a
growing
tree
it
symbolises
growth
or
the
desire
of
growth
the
norman
tower
does
nothing
of
the
kind
it
does
not
aspire
to
grow
look
i
mention
an
instance
with
which
i
am
most
familiar
at
the
norman
tower
of
bury
edmund
it
is
graceful
awful
if
you
will
but
there
is
no
aspiration
in
it
it
is
stately
but
its
horizontal
courses
circular
arches
above
all
its
flat
seem
to
have
risen
enough
and
wish
to
rise
no
higher
for
it
has
no
touch
of
that
unrest
of
soul
which
is
expressed
by
the
spire
and
still
more
by
the
compound
spire
with
its
pinnacles
crockets
finials
which
are
finials
only
in
name
for
they
do
not
finish
and
are
really
terminal
buds
as
it
were
longing
to
open
and
grow
upward
even
as
the
crockets
are
bracts
and
leaves
thrown
off
as
the
shoot
has
grown
you
feel
surely
the
truth
of
these
last
words
you
can
not
look
at
the
canopy
work
or
the
pinnacle
work
of
this
cathedral
without
seeing
that
they
do
not
merely
suggest
buds
and
leaves
but
that
the
buds
and
leaves
are
there
carven
before
your
eyes
i
myself
can
not
look
at
the
tabernacle
work
of
our
stalls
without
being
reminded
of
the
young
pine
forests
which
clothe
the
hampshire
moors
but
if
the
details
are
copied
from
vegetable
forms
why
not
the
whole
is
not
a
spire
like
a
growing
tree
a
tabernacle
like
a
a
compound
spire
like
a
group
of
firs
and
if
we
can
see
that
do
you
fancy
that
the
man
who
planned
the
spire
did
not
see
it
as
clearly
as
we
do
and
perhaps
more
clearly
still
i
am
aware
of
course
that
norman
architecture
had
sometimes
its
pinnacle
a
mere
conical
or
polygonal
capping
i
am
aware
that
this
form
only
more
and
more
slender
lasted
on
in
england
during
the
thirteenth
and
the
early
part
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
on
the
continent
under
many
modifications
one
english
kind
whereof
is
usually
called
a
broach
of
which
you
have
a
beautiful
specimen
in
the
new
church
at
hoole
now
no
one
will
deny
that
that
broach
is
beautiful
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
that
its
form
was
taken
from
a
north
european
tree
the
cypress
was
unknown
probably
to
our
northern
architects
the
lombardy
poplar
which
has
wandered
hither
i
know
not
when
all
the
way
from
cashmere
had
not
wandered
then
i
believe
further
than
north
italy
the
form
is
rather
that
of
mere
stone
of
the
obelisk
or
of
the
mountain
peak
and
they
in
fact
may
have
at
first
suggested
the
spire
the
grandeur
of
an
isolated
mountain
even
of
a
dolmen
or
single
upright
stone
is
evident
to
all
but
it
is
the
grandeur
not
of
aspiration
but
of
defiance
not
of
the
christian
not
even
of
the
stoic
but
rather
of
the
epicurean
it
says
i
can
not
rise
i
do
not
care
to
rise
i
will
be
contentedly
and
valiantly
that
which
i
am
and
face
circumstances
though
i
can
not
conquer
them
but
it
is
defiance
under
defeat
the
does
not
grow
but
only
decays
fretted
by
rains
peeled
by
frost
splintered
by
lightning
it
must
down
at
last
and
crumble
into
earth
were
it
as
old
as
hard
as
lofty
as
the
matterhorn
itself
and
while
it
stands
it
wants
not
only
aspiration
it
wants
tenderness
it
wants
humility
it
wants
the
unrest
which
tenderness
and
humility
must
breed
and
which
ruskin
so
clearly
recognises
in
the
best
gothic
art
and
meanwhile
it
wants
naturalness
the
mere
smooth
spire
or
broach
i
had
almost
said
even
the
spire
of
salisbury
is
like
no
tall
or
commanding
object
in
nature
it
is
merely
the
caricature
of
one
it
may
be
of
the
the
outline
must
be
broken
must
be
softened
before
it
can
express
the
soul
of
a
creed
which
in
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
far
more
than
now
was
one
of
penitence
as
well
as
of
aspiration
of
passionate
emotion
as
well
as
of
lofty
faith
but
a
shape
which
will
express
that
soul
must
be
sought
not
among
mineral
but
among
vegetable
forms
and
remember
always
if
we
feel
thus
even
now
how
much
more
must
those
medieval
men
of
genius
have
felt
thus
whose
work
we
now
dare
only
copy
line
by
line
so
as
it
seems
to
me
they
sought
among
vegetable
forms
for
what
they
needed
and
they
found
it
at
once
in
the
pine
or
rather
the
fir
the
spruce
and
silver
firs
of
their
own
forests
they
are
not
of
course
indigenous
to
england
but
they
are
so
common
through
all
the
rest
of
europe
that
not
only
would
the
form
suggest
itself
to
a
continental
architect
but
to
any
english
clerk
who
travelled
as
all
did
who
could
across
the
alps
to
rome
the
not
growing
on
level
ground
like
the
oaks
of
fontainebleau
into
one
flat
roof
of
foliage
but
clinging
to
the
and
the
crag
old
above
young
spire
above
spire
whorl
above
whorl
for
the
young
shoots
of
each
whorl
of
boughs
point
upward
in
the
spring
and
now
and
then
a
whole
bough
breaking
away
as
it
were
into
free
space
turns
upward
altogether
and
forms
a
secondary
spire
on
the
same
tree
this
surely
was
the
form
which
the
mediaeval
architect
seized
to
clothe
with
it
the
sides
and
roof
of
the
stone
mountain
which
he
had
built
piling
up
pinnacles
and
spires
each
crocketed
at
the
angles
that
like
a
group
of
firs
upon
an
isolated
rock
every
point
of
the
building
might
seem
in
act
to
grow
toward
heaven
till
his
idea
culminated
in
that
glorious
minster
of
cologne
which
if
it
ever
be
completed
will
be
the
likeness
of
one
group
of
cliffs
surmounted
by
three
enormous
pines
one
feature
of
the
norman
temple
he
could
keep
for
it
was
copied
from
the
same
nature
which
he
was
trying
to
copy
namely
the
roof
and
gables
ruskin
lays
it
down
as
a
law
that
the
acute
angle
in
roofs
gables
spires
is
the
distinguishing
mark
of
northern
gothic
it
was
adopted
most
probably
at
first
from
domestic
buildings
a
northern
house
or
barn
must
have
a
roof
or
the
snow
will
not
slip
off
it
but
that
fact
was
not
discovered
by
man
it
was
copied
by
him
from
the
rocks
around
he
saw
the
mountain
peak
jut
black
and
bare
above
the
snows
of
winter
he
saw
those
snows
slip
down
in
sheets
rush
down
in
torrents
under
the
sun
from
the
steep
slabs
of
rock
which
coped
the
and
he
copied
in
his
roofs
the
rocks
above
his
town
but
as
the
love
for
decoration
arose
he
would
deck
his
roofs
as
nature
had
decked
hers
till
the
grey
sheets
of
the
cathedral
slates
should
stand
out
amid
pinnacles
and
turrets
rich
with
foliage
as
the
grey
mountain
sides
stood
out
amid
knolls
of
feathery
birch
and
towering
pine
he
failed
though
he
failed
nobly
he
never
succeeded
in
attaining
a
perfectly
natural
style
the
medieval
architects
were
crippled
to
the
last
by
the
tradition
of
artificial
roman
forms
they
began
improving
them
into
naturalness
without
any
clear
notion
of
what
they
wanted
and
when
that
notion
became
clear
it
was
too
late
take
as
an
instance
the
tracery
of
their
windows
it
is
true
as
ruskin
says
that
they
began
by
piercing
holes
in
a
wall
of
the
form
of
a
leaf
which
developed
in
the
rose
window
into
the
form
of
a
star
inside
and
of
a
flower
outside
look
at
such
aloft
there
then
by
introducing
mullions
and
traceries
into
the
lower
part
of
the
window
they
added
stem
and
bough
forms
to
those
flower
forms
but
the
two
did
not
fit
look
at
the
west
window
of
our
choir
and
you
will
see
what
i
mean
the
upright
mullions
break
off
into
bough
curves
graceful
enough
but
these
are
cut
short
as
i
hold
spoiled
by
circular
and
triangular
forms
of
rose
and
trefoil
resting
on
them
as
such
forms
never
rest
in
nature
and
the
whole
though
beautiful
is
only
half
beautiful
it
is
fragmentary
unmeaning
barbaric
because
unnatural
they
failed
too
it
may
be
from
the
very
paucity
of
the
vegetable
forms
they
could
find
to
copy
among
the
flora
of
this
colder
clime
and
so
stopped
short
in
drawing
from
nature
ran
off
into
mere
purposeless
luxuriance
had
they
been
able
to
add
to
their
stock
of
memories
a
hundred
forms
which
they
would
have
seen
in
the
tropics
they
might
have
gone
on
for
centuries
copying
nature
without
exhausting
her
and
yet
did
they
exhaust
even
the
few
forms
of
beauty
which
they
saw
around
them
it
must
be
confessed
that
they
did
not
i
believe
that
they
could
not
because
they
dared
not
the
unnaturalness
of
the
creed
which
they
expressed
always
hampered
them
it
forbade
them
to
look
nature
freely
and
lovingly
in
the
face
it
forbade
them
as
one
glaring
example
to
know
anything
truly
of
the
most
beautiful
of
all
natural
objects
the
human
form
they
were
tempted
perpetually
to
take
nature
as
ornament
not
as
basis
and
they
yielded
at
last
to
the
temptation
till
in
the
age
of
perpendicular
architecture
their
very
ornament
became
unnatural
again
because
conventional
untrue
meaningless
but
the
creed
for
which
they
worked
was
dying
by
that
time
and
therefore
the
art
which
expressed
it
must
needs
die
too
and
even
that
death
or
rather
the
approach
of
it
was
symbolised
truly
in
the
flatter
roof
the
arch
the
tower
of
the
church
the
creed
had
ceased
to
aspire
so
did
the
architecture
it
had
ceased
to
grow
so
did
the
temple
and
the
arch
sank
lower
and
the
rafters
grew
more
horizontal
and
the
likeness
to
the
old
tree
content
to
grow
no
more
took
the
place
of
the
likeness
to
the
young
tree
struggling
toward
the
sky
and
now
unless
you
are
tired
of
listening
to
me
a
few
practical
words
we
are
restoring
our
old
cathedral
stone
by
stone
after
its
ancient
model
we
are
also
trying
to
build
a
new
church
we
are
building
it
as
most
new
churches
in
england
are
now
built
in
a
pure
gothic
style
are
we
doing
right
i
do
not
mean
morally
right
it
is
always
morally
right
to
build
a
new
church
if
needed
whatever
be
its
architecture
it
is
always
morally
right
to
restore
an
old
church
if
it
be
beautiful
and
noble
as
an
heirloom
handed
down
to
us
by
our
ancestors
which
we
have
no
right
i
say
no
right
for
the
sake
of
our
children
and
of
our
children
children
to
leave
to
ruin
but
are
we
artistically
aesthetically
right
is
the
best
gothic
fit
for
our
worship
does
it
express
our
belief
or
shall
we
choose
some
other
style
i
say
that
it
is
and
that
it
is
so
because
it
is
a
style
which
if
not
founded
on
nature
has
taken
into
itself
more
of
nature
of
nature
beautiful
and
healthy
than
any
other
style
with
greater
knowledge
of
nature
both
geographical
and
scientific
fresh
styles
of
architecture
may
and
will
arise
as
much
more
beautiful
and
as
much
more
natural
than
the
gothic
as
gothic
is
more
beautiful
and
natural
than
the
norman
till
then
we
must
take
the
best
models
which
we
have
use
them
and
as
it
were
use
them
up
and
exhaust
them
by
that
time
we
may
have
learnt
to
improve
on
them
and
to
build
churches
more
gothic
than
gothic
itself
more
like
grot
and
grove
than
even
a
northern
cathedral
that
is
the
direction
in
which
we
must
work
and
if
any
shall
say
to
us
as
it
has
been
said
ere
now
after
all
your
new
gothic
churches
are
but
imitations
shams
borrowed
symbols
which
to
you
symbolise
nothing
they
are
romish
churches
meant
to
express
romish
doctrine
built
for
a
protestant
creed
which
they
do
not
express
and
for
a
protestant
worship
which
they
will
not
fit
then
we
shall
answer
not
so
the
objection
might
be
true
if
we
built
norman
or
romanesque
churches
for
we
should
then
be
returning
to
that
very
foreign
and
unnatural
style
which
rome
taught
our
forefathers
and
from
which
they
escaped
gradually
into
the
comparative
freedom
the
comparative
naturalness
of
that
true
gothic
of
which
ruskin
says
so
well
it
is
gladdening
to
remember
that
in
its
utmost
nobleness
the
very
temper
which
has
been
thought
most
averse
to
it
the
protestant
temper
of
and
inquiry
were
expressed
in
every
case
faith
and
aspiration
there
were
in
every
christian
ecclesiastical
building
from
the
first
century
to
the
fifteenth
but
the
moral
habits
to
which
england
in
this
age
owes
the
kind
of
greatness
which
she
has
the
habits
of
philosophical
investigation
of
accurate
thought
of
domestic
seclusion
and
independence
of
stern
and
sincere
upright
searching
into
religious
truth
were
only
traceable
in
the
features
which
were
the
distinctive
creations
of
the
gothic
schools
in
the
varied
foliage
and
thorny
fretwork
and
shadowy
niche
and
buttressed
pier
and
fearless
height
of
subtle
pinnacle
and
crested
tower
sent
an
unperplexed
question
up
to
heaven
so
says
ruskin
i
for
one
endorse
his
gallant
words
and
i
think
that
a
strong
proof
of
their
truth
is
to
be
found
in
two
facts
which
seem
at
first
paradoxical
first
that
the
new
roman
catholic
churches
on
the
continent
i
speak
especially
of
france
which
is
the
most
highly
cultivated
romanist
country
are
like
those
which
the
jesuits
built
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
less
and
less
gothic
the
former
were
the
latter
are
rather
of
a
new
fantastic
romanesque
or
rather
byzantinesque
style
which
is
a
real
retrogression
from
gothic
towards
earlier
and
less
natural
schools
next
that
the
puritan
communions
the
kirk
of
scotland
and
the
english
nonconformists
as
they
are
becoming
more
cultivated
and
there
are
now
many
highly
cultivated
men
among
them
are
introducing
gothic
architecture
more
and
more
into
their
churches
there
are
elements
in
it
it
seems
which
do
not
contradict
their
puritanism
elements
which
they
can
adapt
to
their
own
worship
namely
the
very
elements
which
ruskin
has
discerned
but
if
they
can
do
so
how
much
more
can
we
of
the
church
of
england
as
long
as
we
go
on
where
our
medieval
forefathers
left
off
as
long
as
we
keep
to
the
most
perfect
types
of
their
work
in
waiting
for
the
day
when
we
shall
be
able
to
surpass
them
by
making
our
work
even
more
naturalistic
than
theirs
more
truly
expressive
of
the
highest
aspirations
of
humanity
so
long
we
are
reverencing
them
and
that
latent
protestantism
in
them
which
produced
at
last
the
reformation
and
if
any
should
say
nevertheless
your
protestant
gothic
church
though
you
made
it
ten
times
more
beautiful
and
more
symbolic
than
cologne
minster
itself
would
still
be
a
sham
for
where
would
be
your
images
and
still
more
where
would
be
your
host
do
you
not
know
that
in
the
medieval
church
the
vistas
of
its
arcades
the
alternations
of
its
lights
and
shadows
the
gradations
of
its
colouring
and
all
its
carefully
subordinated
wealth
of
art
pointed
to
were
concentrated
round
one
sacred
spot
as
a
curve
however
vast
its
sweep
though
space
tends
at
every
moment
toward
a
single
focus
and
that
spot
that
focus
was
and
is
still
in
every
romish
church
the
body
of
god
present
upon
the
altar
in
the
form
of
bread
without
him
what
is
all
your
building
your
church
is
empty
your
altar
bare
a
throne
without
a
king
an
socket
without
an
eye
my
friends
if
we
be
true
children
of
those
old
worthies
whom
tacitus
saw
worshipping
beneath
the
german
oaks
we
shall
have
but
one
answer
to
that
scoff
we
know
it
and
we
glory
in
the
fact
we
glory
in
it
as
the
old
jews
gloried
in
it
when
the
roman
soldiers
bursting
through
the
temple
and
into
the
holy
of
holies
itself
paused
in
wonder
and
in
awe
when
they
beheld
neither
god
nor
image
of
god
but
blank
yet
the
empty
like
theirs
our
altar
is
an
empty
throne
for
it
symbolises
our
worship
of
him
who
dwelleth
not
in
temples
made
with
hands
whom
the
heaven
and
the
heaven
of
heavens
can
not
contain
our
holds
no
eye
for
it
symbolises
our
worship
of
that
eye
which
is
over
all
the
earth
which
is
about
our
path
and
about
our
bed
and
spies
out
all
our
ways
we
need
no
artificial
and
material
presence
of
deity
for
we
believe
in
that
one
eternal
and
universal
real
presence
of
which
it
is
written
he
is
not
far
from
any
one
of
us
for
in
god
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
and
again
lo
i
am
with
you
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
again
wheresoever
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name
there
am
i
in
the
midst
of
them
he
is
the
god
of
nature
as
well
as
the
god
of
grace
for
ever
he
looks
down
on
all
things
which
he
has
made
and
behold
they
are
very
good
and
therefore
we
dare
offer
to
him
in
our
churches
the
most
perfect
works
of
naturalistic
art
and
shape
them
into
copies
of
whatever
beauty
he
has
shown
us
in
man
or
woman
in
cave
or
mountain
peak
in
tree
or
flower
even
in
bird
or
butterfly
but
himself
who
can
see
him
except
the
humble
and
the
contrite
heart
to
whom
he
reveals
himself
as
a
spirit
to
be
worshipped
in
spirit
and
in
truth
and
not
in
bread
nor
wood
nor
stone
nor
gold
nor
quintessential
diamond
so
we
shall
obey
the
sound
instinct
of
our
christian
forefathers
when
they
shaped
their
churches
into
forest
aisles
and
decked
them
with
the
boughs
of
the
woodland
and
the
flowers
of
the
field
but
we
shall
obey
too
that
sounder
instinct
of
theirs
which
made
them
at
last
cast
out
of
their
own
temples
as
misplaced
and
unnatural
things
the
idols
which
they
had
inherited
from
rome
so
we
shall
obey
the
sound
instinct
of
our
heathen
forefathers
when
they
worshipped
the
unknown
god
beneath
the
oaks
of
the
primeval
forest
but
we
shall
obey
too
that
sounder
instinct
of
theirs
which
taught
them
this
at
least
concerning
god
that
it
was
beneath
his
dignity
to
coop
him
within
walls
and
that
the
grandest
forms
of
nature
as
well
as
the
deepest
consciousnesses
of
their
own
souls
revealed
to
them
a
mysterious
being
who
was
to
be
beheld
by
faith
alone
george
buchanan
scholar
the
scholar
in
the
sixteenth
century
was
a
far
more
important
personage
than
now
the
supply
of
learned
men
was
very
small
the
demand
for
them
very
great
during
the
whole
of
the
fifteenth
and
a
great
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
human
mind
turned
more
and
more
from
the
scholastic
philosophy
of
the
middle
ages
to
that
of
the
romans
and
the
greeks
and
found
more
and
more
in
old
pagan
art
an
element
which
monastic
art
had
not
and
which
was
yet
necessary
for
the
full
satisfaction
of
their
craving
after
the
beautiful
at
such
a
crisis
of
thought
and
taste
it
was
natural
that
the
classical
scholar
the
man
who
knew
old
rome
and
still
more
old
greece
should
usurp
the
place
of
the
monk
as
teacher
of
mankind
and
that
scholars
should
form
for
a
while
a
new
and
powerful
aristocracy
limited
and
privileged
and
all
the
more
redoubtable
because
its
power
lay
in
intellect
and
had
been
won
by
intellect
alone
those
who
whether
poor
or
rich
did
not
fear
the
monk
and
priest
at
least
feared
the
scholar
who
held
so
the
vulgar
believed
the
keys
of
that
magic
lore
by
which
the
old
necromancers
had
built
cities
like
rome
and
worked
marvels
of
mechanical
and
chemical
skill
which
the
degenerate
modern
could
never
equal
if
the
scholar
stopped
in
a
town
his
hostess
probably
begged
of
him
a
charm
against
toothache
or
rheumatism
the
penniless
knight
discoursed
with
him
on
alchemy
and
the
chances
of
retrieving
his
fortune
by
the
art
of
transmuting
metals
into
gold
the
queen
or
bishop
worried
him
in
private
about
casting
their
nativities
and
finding
their
fates
among
the
stars
but
the
statesman
who
dealt
with
more
practical
matters
hired
him
as
an
advocate
and
rhetorician
who
could
fight
his
master
enemies
with
the
weapons
of
demosthenes
and
cicero
wherever
the
scholar
steps
were
turned
he
might
be
master
of
others
as
long
as
he
was
master
of
himself
the
complaints
which
he
so
often
uttered
concerning
the
cruelty
of
fortune
the
fickleness
of
princes
and
so
forth
were
probably
no
more
just
then
than
such
complaints
are
now
then
as
now
he
got
his
deserts
and
the
world
bought
him
at
his
own
price
if
he
chose
to
sell
himself
to
this
patron
and
to
that
he
was
used
and
thrown
away
if
he
chose
to
remain
in
honourable
independence
he
was
courted
and
feared
among
the
successful
scholars
of
the
sixteenth
century
none
surely
is
more
notable
than
george
buchanan
the
poor
scotch
widow
son
by
force
of
native
wit
and
as
i
think
by
force
of
native
worth
fights
his
way
upward
through
poverty
and
severest
persecution
to
become
the
correspondent
and
friend
of
the
greatest
literary
celebrities
of
the
continent
comparable
in
their
opinion
to
the
best
latin
poets
of
antiquity
the
preceptor
of
princes
the
counsellor
and
spokesman
of
scotch
statesmen
in
the
most
dangerous
of
times
and
leaves
behind
him
political
treatises
which
have
influenced
not
only
the
history
of
his
own
country
but
that
of
the
civilised
world
such
a
success
could
not
be
attained
without
making
enemies
perhaps
without
making
mistakes
but
the
more
we
study
george
history
the
less
we
shall
be
inclined
to
hunt
out
his
failings
the
more
inclined
to
admire
his
worth
a
shrewd
affectionate
man
with
a
strong
love
of
right
and
scorn
of
wrong
and
a
humour
withal
which
saved
him
except
on
really
great
occasions
from
bitterness
and
helped
him
to
laugh
where
narrower
natures
would
have
only
snarled
he
is
in
many
respects
a
type
of
those
lowland
scots
who
long
preserved
his
jokes
genuine
or
reputed
as
a
common
household
book
a
schoolmaster
by
profession
and
struggling
for
long
years
amid
the
temptations
which
in
those
days
degraded
his
class
into
cruel
and
sordid
pedants
he
rose
from
the
mere
pedagogue
to
be
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
a
courtier
one
says
daniel
heinsius
who
seemed
not
only
born
for
a
court
but
born
to
amend
it
he
brought
to
his
queen
that
at
which
she
could
not
wonder
enough
for
by
affecting
a
certain
liberty
in
censuring
morals
he
avoided
all
offence
under
the
cloak
of
simplicity
of
him
and
his
compeers
turnebus
and
muretus
and
their
friend
andrea
govea
ronsard
the
french
court
poet
said
that
they
had
nothing
of
the
pedagogue
about
them
but
the
gown
and
cap
austere
in
face
and
rustic
in
his
looks
says
david
buchanan
but
most
polished
in
style
and
speech
and
continually
even
in
serious
conversation
jesting
most
wittily
roughhewn
slovenly
and
rude
says
peacham
in
his
gentleman
speaking
of
him
probably
as
he
appeared
in
old
age
in
his
person
behaviour
and
fashion
seldom
caring
for
a
better
outside
than
a
girt
close
about
him
yet
his
inside
and
conceipt
in
poesie
was
most
rich
and
his
sweetness
and
facilitie
in
verse
most
excellent
a
typical
lowland
scot
as
i
said
just
now
he
seems
to
have
absorbed
all
the
best
culture
which
france
could
afford
him
without
losing
the
strength
honesty
and
humour
which
he
inherited
from
his
stirlingshire
kindred
the
story
of
his
life
is
easily
traced
when
an
old
man
he
himself
wrote
down
the
main
events
of
it
at
the
request
of
his
friends
and
his
sketch
has
been
filled
out
by
commentators
if
not
always
favourable
at
least
erudite
born
in
at
the
moss
in
killearn
where
an
obelisk
to
his
memory
so
one
reads
has
been
erected
in
this
century
of
a
family
rather
ancient
than
rich
his
father
dead
in
the
prime
of
manhood
his
grandfather
a
spendthrift
he
and
his
seven
brothers
and
sisters
were
brought
up
by
a
widowed
mother
agnes
heriot
of
whom
one
wishes
to
know
more
for
the
rule
that
great
sons
have
great
mothers
probably
holds
good
in
her
case
george
gave
signs
while
at
the
village
school
of
future
scholarship
and
when
he
was
only
fourteen
his
uncle
james
sent
him
to
the
university
of
paris
those
were
hard
times
and
the
youths
or
rather
boys
who
meant
to
become
scholars
had
a
cruel
life
of
it
cast
desperately
out
on
the
wide
world
to
beg
and
starve
either
into
and
success
or
into
ruin
of
body
and
soul
and
a
cruel
life
george
had
within
two
years
he
was
down
in
a
severe
illness
his
uncle
dead
his
supplies
stopped
and
the
boy
of
sixteen
got
home
he
does
not
tell
how
then
he
tried
soldiering
and
was
with
albany
french
auxiliaries
at
the
ineffectual
attack
on
wark
castle
marching
back
through
deep
snow
he
got
a
fresh
illness
which
kept
him
in
bed
all
winter
then
he
and
his
brother
were
sent
to
andrew
where
he
got
his
at
nineteen
the
next
summer
he
went
to
france
once
more
and
fell
he
says
into
the
flames
of
the
lutheran
sect
which
was
then
spreading
far
and
wide
two
years
of
penury
followed
and
then
three
years
of
schoolmastering
in
the
college
of
barbe
which
he
has
immortalised
at
least
for
the
few
who
care
to
read
modern
latin
poetry
in
his
elegy
on
miseries
of
a
parisian
teacher
of
the
humanities
the
wretched
regent
master
pale
and
suffering
sits
up
all
night
preparing
his
lecture
biting
his
nails
and
thumping
his
desk
and
falls
asleep
for
a
few
minutes
to
start
up
at
the
sound
of
the
four
bell
and
be
in
school
by
five
his
virgil
in
one
hand
and
his
rod
in
the
other
trying
to
do
work
on
his
own
account
at
old
manuscripts
and
bawling
all
the
while
at
his
wretched
boys
who
cheat
him
and
pay
each
other
to
answer
to
truants
names
the
class
is
all
wrong
one
is
barefoot
another
shoe
is
burst
another
cries
another
writes
home
then
comes
the
rod
the
sound
of
blows
and
howls
and
the
day
passes
in
tears
then
mass
then
another
lesson
then
more
blows
there
is
hardly
time
to
eat
i
have
no
space
to
finish
the
picture
of
the
stupid
misery
which
buchanan
says
was
ruining
his
intellect
while
it
starved
his
body
however
happier
days
came
gilbert
kennedy
earl
of
cassilis
who
seems
to
have
been
a
noble
young
gentleman
took
him
as
his
tutor
for
the
next
five
years
and
with
him
he
went
back
to
scotland
but
there
his
plain
speaking
got
him
as
it
did
more
than
once
afterward
into
trouble
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
write
in
imitation
of
dunbar
a
latin
poem
in
which
francis
asks
him
in
a
dream
to
become
a
grey
friar
and
buchanan
answered
in
language
which
had
the
unpleasant
fault
of
being
too
clever
and
to
judge
from
contemporary
evidence
only
too
true
the
friars
said
nothing
at
first
but
when
king
james
made
buchanan
tutor
to
one
of
his
natural
sons
they
men
professing
meekness
took
the
matter
somewhat
more
angrily
than
befitted
men
so
pious
in
the
opinion
of
the
people
so
buchanan
himself
puts
it
but
to
do
the
poor
friars
justice
they
must
have
been
angels
not
men
if
they
did
not
writhe
somewhat
under
the
scourge
which
he
had
laid
on
them
to
be
told
that
there
was
hardly
a
place
in
heaven
for
monks
was
hard
to
hear
and
bear
they
accused
him
to
the
king
of
heresy
but
not
being
then
in
favour
with
james
they
got
no
answer
and
buchanan
was
commanded
to
repeat
the
castigation
having
found
out
that
the
friars
were
not
to
be
touched
with
impunity
he
wrote
he
says
a
short
and
ambiguous
poem
but
the
king
who
loved
a
joke
demanded
something
sharp
and
stinging
and
buchanan
obeyed
by
writing
but
not
publishing
the
a
long
satire
compared
to
which
the
was
bland
and
merciful
the
storm
rose
cardinal
beaton
buchanan
says
wanted
to
buy
him
of
the
king
and
then
of
course
burn
him
as
he
had
just
burnt
five
poor
souls
so
knowing
james
avarice
he
fled
to
england
through
freebooters
and
pestilence
there
he
found
he
says
men
of
both
factions
being
burned
on
the
same
day
and
in
the
same
fire
a
pardonable
exaggeration
by
henry
in
his
old
age
more
intent
on
his
own
safety
than
on
the
purity
of
religion
so
to
his
beloved
france
he
went
again
to
find
his
enemy
beaton
ambassador
at
paris
the
capital
was
too
hot
to
hold
him
and
he
fled
south
to
bourdeaux
to
andrea
govea
the
portuguese
principal
of
the
college
of
gruienne
as
professor
of
latin
at
bourdeaux
we
find
him
presenting
a
latin
poem
to
charles
and
indulging
that
fancy
of
his
for
latin
poetry
which
seems
to
us
a
childish
pedantry
which
was
then
when
latin
was
the
vernacular
tongue
of
all
scholars
a
serious
if
not
altogether
a
useful
pursuit
of
his
tragedies
so
famous
in
their
day
the
the
the
and
the
there
is
neither
space
nor
need
to
speak
here
save
to
notice
the
bold
declamations
in
the
against
tyranny
and
priestcraft
and
to
notice
also
that
these
tragedies
gained
for
the
poor
scotsman
in
the
eyes
of
the
best
scholars
of
europe
a
credit
amounting
almost
to
veneration
when
he
returned
to
paris
he
found
occupation
at
once
and
as
his
scots
biographers
love
to
record
three
of
the
most
learned
men
in
the
world
taught
humanity
in
the
same
college
turnebus
muretus
and
buchanan
then
followed
a
strange
episode
in
his
life
a
university
had
been
founded
at
coimbra
in
portugal
and
andrea
govea
had
been
invited
to
bring
thither
what
french
savans
he
could
collect
buchanan
went
to
portugal
with
his
brother
patrick
two
more
scotsmen
dempster
and
ramsay
and
a
goodly
company
of
french
scholars
whose
names
and
histories
may
be
read
in
the
erudite
pages
of
irving
went
likewise
all
prospered
in
the
new
temple
of
the
muses
for
a
year
or
so
then
its
govea
died
and
by
a
peripeteia
too
common
in
those
days
and
countries
buchanan
and
two
of
his
friends
migrated
unwillingly
from
the
temple
of
the
muses
for
that
of
moloch
and
found
themselves
in
the
inquisition
buchanan
it
seems
had
said
that
augustine
was
more
of
a
lutheran
than
a
catholic
on
the
question
of
the
mass
he
and
his
friends
had
eaten
flesh
in
lent
which
he
says
almost
everyone
in
spain
did
but
he
was
suspected
and
with
reason
as
a
heretic
the
grey
friars
formed
but
one
brotherhood
throughout
europe
and
news
among
them
travelled
surely
if
not
fast
so
that
the
story
of
the
satire
written
in
scotland
had
reached
portugal
the
culprits
were
imprisoned
examined
bullied
but
not
tortured
for
a
year
and
a
half
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
proofs
of
heresy
it
seems
were
insufficient
but
lest
says
buchanan
with
honest
pride
they
should
get
the
reputation
of
having
vainly
tormented
a
man
not
altogether
unknown
they
sent
him
for
some
months
to
a
monastery
to
be
instructed
by
the
monks
the
men
he
says
were
neither
inhuman
nor
bad
but
utterly
ignorant
of
religion
and
buchanan
solaced
himself
during
the
intervals
of
their
instructions
by
beginning
his
latin
translation
of
the
psalms
at
last
he
got
free
and
begged
leave
to
return
to
france
but
in
vain
wearied
out
at
last
he
got
on
board
a
candian
ship
at
lisbon
and
escaped
to
england
but
england
he
says
during
the
anarchy
of
edward
vi
reign
was
not
a
land
which
suited
him
and
he
returned
to
his
beloved
france
to
fulfil
the
hopes
which
he
had
expressed
in
his
charming
lutitiae
and
the
still
more
charming
because
more
simple
in
galliam
in
which
he
bids
farewell
in
most
melodious
verse
to
the
hungry
moors
of
wretched
portugal
and
her
clods
fertile
in
naught
but
penury
some
seven
years
succeeded
of
schoolmastering
and
the
latin
paraphrase
of
the
psalms
another
of
the
of
euripides
an
epithalamium
on
the
marriage
of
poor
mary
stuart
noble
and
sincere
however
fantastic
and
pedantic
after
the
manner
of
the
times
pomps
too
for
her
wedding
and
for
other
public
ceremonies
in
which
all
the
heathen
gods
and
goddesses
figure
epigrams
panegyrics
satires
much
of
which
latter
productions
he
would
have
consigned
to
the
in
his
old
age
had
not
his
too
fond
friends
persuaded
him
to
republish
the
follies
and
coarsenesses
of
his
youth
he
was
now
one
of
the
most
famous
scholars
in
europe
and
the
intimate
friend
of
all
the
great
literary
men
was
he
to
go
on
to
the
end
die
and
no
more
was
he
to
sink
into
the
mere
pedant
or
if
he
could
not
do
that
into
the
mere
court
versifier
the
wars
of
religion
saved
him
as
they
saved
many
another
noble
soul
from
that
degradation
the
events
of
forced
buchanan
as
they
forced
many
a
learned
man
besides
to
choose
whether
he
would
be
a
child
of
light
or
a
child
of
darkness
whether
he
would
be
a
dilettante
classicist
or
a
preacher
it
might
be
a
martyr
of
the
gospel
buchanan
may
have
left
france
in
the
troubles
merely
to
enjoy
in
his
own
country
elegant
and
learned
repose
he
may
have
fancied
that
he
had
found
it
when
he
saw
himself
in
spite
of
his
public
profession
of
adherence
to
the
reformed
kirk
reading
livy
every
afternoon
with
his
exquisite
young
sovereign
master
by
her
favour
of
the
temporalities
of
crossraguel
abbey
and
by
the
favour
of
murray
principal
of
leonard
college
in
andrew
perhaps
he
fancied
at
times
that
was
to
be
as
and
much
more
abundant
that
thenceforth
he
might
read
his
folio
and
write
his
epigram
and
joke
his
joke
as
a
lazy
comfortable
pluralist
taking
his
morning
stroll
out
to
the
corner
where
poor
wishart
had
been
burned
above
the
blue
sea
and
the
yellow
sands
and
looking
up
to
the
castle
tower
from
whence
his
enemy
beaton
corpse
had
been
hung
out
with
the
comfortable
reflection
that
quietier
times
had
come
and
that
whatever
evil
deeds
archbishop
hamilton
might
dare
he
would
not
dare
to
put
the
principal
of
leonard
into
the
bottle
dungeon
if
such
hopes
ever
crossed
geordie
keen
fancy
they
were
disappointed
suddenly
and
fearfully
the
fire
which
had
been
kindled
in
france
was
to
reach
to
scotland
likewise
revolutions
are
not
made
with
and
the
time
was
at
hand
when
all
good
spirits
in
scotland
and
george
buchanan
among
them
had
to
choose
once
and
for
all
amid
danger
confusion
terror
whether
they
would
serve
god
or
mammon
for
to
serve
both
would
be
soon
impossible
which
side
in
that
war
of
light
and
darkness
george
buchanan
took
is
notorious
he
saw
then
as
others
have
seen
since
that
the
two
men
in
scotland
who
were
capable
of
being
her
captains
in
the
strife
were
knox
and
murray
and
to
them
he
gave
in
his
allegiance
heart
and
soul
this
is
the
critical
epoch
in
buchanan
life
by
his
conduct
to
queen
mary
he
must
stand
or
fall
it
is
my
belief
that
he
will
stand
it
is
not
my
intention
to
enter
into
the
details
of
a
matter
so
painful
so
shocking
so
prodigious
and
now
that
that
question
is
finally
set
at
rest
by
the
writings
both
of
froude
and
burton
there
is
no
need
to
allude
to
it
further
save
where
buchanan
name
is
concerned
one
may
now
have
every
sympathy
with
mary
stuart
one
may
regard
with
awe
a
figure
so
stately
so
tragic
in
one
sense
so
heroic
for
she
reminds
one
rather
of
the
heroine
of
an
old
greek
tragedy
swept
to
her
doom
by
some
irresistible
fate
than
of
a
being
of
our
own
flesh
and
blood
and
of
our
modern
and
christian
times
one
may
sympathise
with
the
great
womanhood
which
charmed
so
many
while
she
was
alive
which
has
charmed
in
later
years
so
many
noble
spirits
who
have
believed
in
her
innocence
and
have
doubtless
been
elevated
and
purified
by
their
devotion
to
one
who
seemed
to
them
an
ideal
being
so
far
from
regarding
her
as
a
hateful
personage
one
may
feel
oneself
forbidden
to
hate
a
woman
whom
god
may
have
loved
and
may
have
pardoned
to
judge
from
the
punishment
so
swift
and
yet
so
enduring
which
he
inflicted
at
least
he
must
so
believe
who
holds
that
punishment
is
a
sign
of
mercy
that
the
most
dreadful
of
all
dooms
is
impunity
nay
more
those
casket
letters
and
sonnets
may
be
a
relief
to
the
mind
of
one
who
believes
in
her
guilt
on
other
grounds
a
relief
when
one
finds
in
them
a
tenderness
a
sweetness
a
delicacy
a
magnificent
however
hideously
misplaced
which
shows
what
a
womanly
heart
was
there
a
heart
which
joined
to
that
queenly
brain
might
have
made
her
a
blessing
and
a
glory
to
scotland
had
not
the
whole
character
been
warped
and
ruinate
from
childhood
by
an
education
so
abominable
that
any
one
who
knows
what
words
she
must
have
heard
what
scenes
she
must
have
beheld
in
france
from
her
youth
up
will
wonder
that
she
sinned
so
little
not
that
she
sinned
so
much
one
may
feel
in
a
word
that
there
is
every
excuse
for
those
who
have
asserted
mary
innocence
because
their
own
shrank
from
believing
her
guilty
but
yet
buchanan
in
his
own
place
and
time
may
have
felt
as
deeply
that
he
could
do
no
otherwise
than
he
did
the
charges
against
him
as
all
readers
of
scotch
literature
know
well
may
be
reduced
to
two
heads
the
letters
and
sonnets
were
forgeries
maitland
of
lethington
may
have
forged
the
letters
buchanan
according
to
some
the
sonnets
whoever
forged
them
buchanan
made
use
of
them
in
his
detection
knowing
them
to
be
forged
whether
mary
was
innocent
or
not
buchanan
acted
a
base
and
ungrateful
part
in
putting
himself
in
the
forefront
amongst
her
accusers
he
had
been
her
tutor
her
pensioner
she
had
heaped
him
with
favours
and
after
all
she
was
his
queen
and
a
defenceless
woman
and
yet
he
returned
her
kindness
in
the
hour
of
her
fall
by
invectives
fit
only
for
a
rancorous
and
reckless
advocate
determined
to
force
a
verdict
by
the
basest
arts
of
oratory
now
as
to
the
casket
letters
i
should
have
thought
they
bore
in
themselves
the
best
evidence
of
being
genuine
i
can
add
nothing
to
the
arguments
of
froude
and
burton
save
this
that
no
one
clever
enough
to
be
a
forger
would
have
put
together
documents
so
incoherent
and
so
incomplete
for
the
evidence
of
guilt
which
they
contain
is
after
all
slight
and
indirect
and
moreover
superfluous
altogether
seeing
that
mary
guilt
was
open
and
palpable
before
the
supposed
discovery
of
the
letters
to
every
person
at
home
and
abroad
who
had
any
knowledge
of
the
facts
as
for
the
alleged
inconsistency
of
the
letters
with
proven
facts
the
answer
is
that
whosoever
wrote
the
letters
would
be
more
likely
to
know
facts
which
were
taking
place
around
them
than
any
critic
could
be
one
hundred
or
three
hundred
years
afterwards
but
if
these
mistakes
as
to
facts
actually
exist
in
them
they
are
only
a
fresh
argument
for
their
authenticity
mary
writing
in
agony
and
confusion
might
easily
make
a
mistake
forgers
would
only
take
too
good
care
to
make
none
but
the
strongest
evidence
in
favour
of
the
letters
and
sonnets
in
spite
of
the
arguments
of
good
whittaker
and
other
apologists
for
mary
is
to
be
found
in
their
tone
a
forger
in
those
coarse
days
would
have
made
mary
write
in
some
semiramis
or
roxana
vein
utterly
alien
to
the
tenderness
the
delicacy
the
pitiful
confusion
of
mind
the
conscious
weakness
the
imploring
and
most
feminine
trust
which
makes
the
letters
to
those
who
as
i
do
believe
in
them
more
pathetic
than
any
fictitious
sorrows
which
poets
could
invent
more
than
one
touch
indeed
of
utter
in
the
second
letter
is
so
unexpected
so
subtle
and
yet
so
true
to
the
heart
of
woman
that
as
has
been
well
said
if
it
was
invented
there
must
have
existed
in
scotland
an
earlier
shakespeare
who
yet
has
died
without
leaving
any
other
sign
for
good
or
evil
of
his
dramatic
genius
as
for
the
theory
totally
unsupported
that
buchanan
forged
the
poem
usually
called
the
sonnets
it
is
paying
old
geordie
genius
however
versatile
it
may
have
been
too
high
a
compliment
to
believe
that
he
could
have
written
both
them
and
the
detection
while
it
is
paying
his
shrewdness
too
low
a
compliment
to
believe
that
he
could
have
put
into
them
out
of
mere
carelessness
or
stupidity
the
line
which
seems
incompatible
with
the
theory
both
of
the
letters
and
of
his
own
detection
and
which
has
ere
now
been
brought
forward
as
a
fresh
proof
of
mary
innocence
and
as
with
the
letters
so
with
the
sonnets
their
delicacy
their
grace
their
reticence
are
so
many
arguments
against
their
having
been
forged
by
any
scot
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
least
of
all
by
one
in
whose
character
whatever
his
other
virtues
may
have
been
delicacy
was
by
no
means
the
strongest
point
as
for
the
complaint
that
buchanan
was
ungrateful
to
mary
it
must
be
said
that
even
if
she
and
not
murray
had
bestowed
on
him
the
temporalities
of
crossraguel
abbey
four
years
before
it
was
merely
fair
pay
for
services
fairly
rendered
and
i
am
not
aware
that
payment
or
even
favours
however
gracious
bind
any
man
soul
and
conscience
in
questions
of
highest
morality
and
highest
public
importance
and
the
importance
of
that
question
can
not
be
exaggerated
at
a
moment
when
scotland
seemed
struggling
in
of
anarchy
civil
and
religious
and
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
prey
either
to
england
or
to
france
if
there
could
not
be
formed
out
of
the
heart
of
her
a
people
steadfast
trusty
united
strong
politically
because
strong
in
the
fear
of
god
and
the
desire
of
righteousness
at
such
a
moment
as
this
a
crime
had
been
committed
the
like
of
which
had
not
been
heard
in
europe
since
the
tragedy
of
joan
of
naples
all
europe
stood
aghast
the
honour
of
the
scottish
nation
was
at
stake
more
than
mary
or
bothwell
were
known
to
be
implicated
in
the
deed
and
as
buchanan
puts
it
in
the
opening
of
his
jure
regni
the
fault
of
some
few
was
charged
upon
all
and
the
common
hatred
of
a
particular
person
did
redound
to
the
whole
nation
so
that
even
such
as
were
remote
from
any
suspicion
were
inflamed
by
the
infamy
of
men
crimes
to
vindicate
the
national
honour
and
to
punish
the
guilty
as
well
as
to
save
themselves
from
utter
anarchy
the
great
majority
of
the
scotch
nation
had
taken
measures
against
mary
which
required
explicit
justification
in
the
sight
of
europe
as
buchanan
frankly
confesses
in
the
opening
of
his
de
jure
regni
the
chief
authors
of
those
measures
had
been
summoned
perhaps
unwisely
and
unjustly
to
answer
for
their
conduct
to
the
queen
of
england
queen
elizabeth
a
fact
which
was
notorious
enough
then
though
it
has
been
forgotten
till
the
last
few
years
was
doing
her
utmost
to
shield
mary
buchanan
was
deputed
it
seems
to
speak
out
for
the
people
of
scotland
and
certainly
never
people
had
an
abler
apologist
if
he
spoke
fiercely
savagely
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
spoke
of
a
fierce
and
savage
matter
if
he
used
and
it
may
be
abused
all
the
arts
of
oratory
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
was
fighting
for
the
honour
and
it
may
be
for
the
national
life
of
his
country
and
striking
as
men
in
such
cases
have
a
right
to
strike
as
hard
as
he
could
if
he
makes
no
secret
of
his
indignation
and
even
contempt
it
must
be
remembered
that
indignation
and
contempt
may
well
have
been
real
with
him
while
they
were
real
with
the
soundest
part
of
his
countrymen
with
that
reforming
middle
class
comparatively
untainted
by
french
profligacy
comparatively
undebauched
by
feudal
subservience
which
has
been
the
leaven
which
has
leavened
the
whole
scottish
people
in
the
last
three
centuries
with
the
elements
of
their
greatness
if
finally
he
heaps
up
against
the
unhappy
queen
charges
which
burton
thinks
incredible
it
must
be
remembered
that
as
he
well
says
these
charges
give
the
popular
feeling
about
queen
mary
and
it
must
be
remembered
also
that
that
popular
feeling
need
not
have
been
altogether
unfounded
stories
which
are
incredible
thank
god
in
these
milder
days
were
credible
enough
then
because
alas
they
were
so
often
true
things
more
ugly
than
any
related
of
poor
mary
were
possible
enough
as
no
one
knew
better
than
buchanan
in
that
very
french
court
in
which
mary
had
been
brought
up
things
as
ugly
were
possible
in
scotland
then
and
for
at
least
a
century
later
and
while
we
may
hope
that
buchanan
has
overstated
his
case
we
must
not
blame
him
too
severely
for
yielding
to
a
temptation
common
to
all
men
of
genius
when
their
creative
power
is
roused
to
its
highest
energy
by
a
great
cause
and
a
great
indignation
and
that
the
genius
was
there
no
man
can
doubt
one
can
not
read
that
hideously
eloquent
description
of
kirk
o
field
which
burton
has
well
chosen
as
a
specimen
of
buchanan
style
without
seeing
that
we
are
face
to
face
with
a
genius
of
a
very
lofty
order
not
indeed
of
the
loftiest
for
there
is
always
in
buchanan
work
it
seems
to
me
a
want
of
unconsciousness
and
a
want
of
tenderness
but
still
a
genius
worthy
to
be
placed
beside
those
ancient
writers
from
whom
he
took
his
manner
whether
or
not
we
agree
with
his
contemporaries
who
say
that
he
equalled
virgil
in
latin
poetry
we
may
place
him
fairly
as
a
prose
writer
by
the
side
of
demosthenes
cicero
or
tacitus
and
so
i
pass
from
this
painful
subject
only
quoting
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
quote
burton
wise
and
gentle
verdict
on
the
whole
buchanan
he
says
though
a
zealous
protestant
had
a
good
deal
of
the
catholic
and
sceptical
spirit
of
erasmus
and
an
admiring
eye
for
everything
that
was
great
and
beautiful
like
the
rest
of
his
countrymen
he
bowed
himself
in
presence
of
the
lustre
that
surrounded
the
early
career
of
his
mistress
more
than
once
he
expressed
his
pride
and
reverence
in
the
inspiration
of
a
genius
deemed
by
his
contemporaries
to
be
worthy
of
the
theme
there
is
not
perhaps
to
be
found
elsewhere
in
literature
so
solemn
a
memorial
of
shipwrecked
hopes
of
a
sunny
opening
and
a
stormy
end
as
one
finds
in
turning
the
leaves
of
the
volume
which
contains
the
beautiful
epigram
caledoniae
in
one
part
the
mariae
reginae
in
another
and
this
contrast
is
no
doubt
a
faithful
parallel
of
the
reaction
in
the
popular
mind
this
reaction
seems
to
have
been
general
and
not
limited
to
the
protestant
party
for
the
conditions
under
which
it
became
almost
a
part
of
the
creed
of
the
church
of
rome
to
believe
in
her
innocence
had
not
arisen
if
buchanan
as
some
of
his
detractors
have
thought
raised
himself
by
subserviency
to
the
intrigues
of
the
regent
murray
the
best
heads
in
scotland
seem
to
have
been
of
a
different
opinion
the
murder
of
murray
did
not
involve
buchanan
fall
he
had
avenged
it
as
far
as
pen
could
do
it
by
that
direct
to
the
trew
lordis
in
which
he
showed
himself
as
great
a
master
of
scottish
as
he
was
of
latin
prose
his
satire
of
the
though
its
publication
was
stopped
by
maitland
must
have
been
read
in
manuscript
by
many
of
those
same
true
lords
and
though
there
were
nobler
instincts
in
maitland
than
any
buchanan
gave
him
credit
for
the
satire
breathed
an
honest
indignation
against
that
wily
turncoat
misdoings
which
could
not
but
recommend
the
author
to
all
honest
men
therefore
it
was
i
presume
and
not
because
he
was
a
rogue
and
a
hired
literary
spadassin
that
to
the
best
heads
in
scotland
he
seemed
so
useful
it
may
be
so
worthy
a
man
that
he
be
provided
with
continually
increasing
employment
as
tutor
to
james
as
director
for
a
short
time
of
the
chancery
as
keeper
of
the
privy
seal
and
privy
councillor
as
one
of
the
commissioners
for
codifying
the
laws
and
again
for
in
the
state
of
scotland
government
had
to
do
everything
in
the
way
of
organisation
in
the
committee
for
promulgating
a
standard
latin
grammar
in
the
committee
for
reforming
the
university
of
andrew
in
all
these
buchanan
talents
were
again
and
again
called
for
and
always
ready
the
value
of
his
work
especially
that
for
the
reform
of
andrew
must
be
judged
by
scotchmen
rather
than
by
an
englishman
but
all
that
one
knows
of
it
justifies
melville
sentence
in
the
passage
in
his
memoirs
wherein
he
describes
the
tutors
and
household
of
the
young
king
george
was
a
stoic
philosopher
who
looked
not
far
before
him
in
plain
words
a
and
man
bent
on
doing
the
duty
which
lay
nearest
him
the
worst
that
can
be
said
against
him
during
these
times
is
that
his
name
appears
with
the
sum
of
pounds
against
it
as
one
of
those
who
were
to
be
entertained
in
scotland
by
pensions
out
of
england
and
ruddiman
of
course
comments
on
the
fact
by
saying
that
buchanan
was
at
length
to
act
under
the
threefold
character
of
malcontent
reformer
and
pensioner
but
it
gives
no
proof
whatsoever
that
buchanan
ever
received
any
such
bribe
and
in
the
very
month
seemingly
in
which
that
list
was
written
march
buchanan
had
given
a
proof
to
the
world
that
he
was
not
likely
to
be
bribed
or
bought
by
publishing
a
book
as
offensive
probably
to
queen
elizabeth
as
it
was
to
his
own
royal
pupil
namely
his
famous
jure
regni
apud
scotos
the
very
primer
according
to
many
great
thinkers
of
constitutional
liberty
he
dedicates
that
book
to
king
james
not
only
as
his
monitor
but
also
an
importunate
and
bold
exactor
which
in
these
his
tender
and
flexible
years
may
conduct
him
in
safety
past
the
rocks
of
flattery
he
has
complimented
james
already
on
his
abhorrence
of
flattery
his
inclination
far
above
his
years
for
undertaking
all
heroical
and
noble
attempts
his
promptitude
in
obeying
his
instructors
and
governors
and
all
who
give
him
sound
admonition
and
his
judgment
and
diligence
in
examining
affairs
so
that
no
man
authority
can
have
much
weight
with
him
unless
it
be
confirmed
by
probable
reasons
buchanan
may
have
thought
that
nine
years
of
his
stern
rule
had
eradicated
some
of
ill
conditions
the
petulance
which
made
him
kill
the
master
of
sparrow
in
trying
to
wrest
it
out
of
his
hand
the
carelessness
with
which
if
the
story
told
by
chytraeus
on
the
authority
of
nephew
be
true
james
signed
away
his
crown
to
buchanan
for
fifteen
days
and
only
discovered
his
mistake
by
seeing
buchanan
act
in
open
court
the
character
of
king
of
scots
buchanan
had
at
last
made
him
a
scholar
he
may
have
fancied
that
he
had
made
him
likewise
a
manful
man
yet
he
may
have
dreaded
that
as
james
grew
up
the
old
inclinations
would
return
in
stronger
and
uglier
shapes
and
that
flattery
might
be
as
it
was
after
all
the
cause
of
james
moral
ruin
he
at
least
will
be
no
flatterer
he
opens
the
dialogue
which
he
sends
to
the
king
with
a
calm
but
distinct
assertion
of
his
mother
guilt
and
a
justification
of
the
conduct
of
men
who
were
now
most
of
them
past
helping
buchanan
for
they
were
laid
in
their
graves
and
then
goes
on
to
argue
fairly
but
to
lay
down
firmly
in
a
sort
of
socratic
dialogue
those
very
principles
by
loyalty
to
which
the
house
of
hanover
has
reigned
and
will
reign
over
these
realms
so
with
his
history
of
scotland
later
antiquarian
researches
have
destroyed
the
value
of
the
earlier
portions
of
it
but
they
have
surely
increased
the
value
of
those
later
portions
in
which
buchanan
inserted
so
much
which
he
had
already
spoken
out
in
his
detection
of
mary
in
that
book
also
liberavit
animam
suam
he
spoke
his
mind
fearless
of
consequences
in
the
face
of
a
king
who
he
must
have
known
for
buchanan
was
no
dullard
regarded
him
with
deep
dislike
who
might
in
a
few
years
be
able
to
work
his
ruin
but
those
few
years
were
not
given
to
buchanan
he
had
all
but
done
his
work
and
he
hastened
to
get
it
over
before
the
night
should
come
wherein
no
man
can
work
one
must
be
excused
for
telling
one
would
not
tell
it
in
a
book
intended
to
be
read
only
by
scotchmen
who
know
or
ought
to
know
the
tale
already
how
the
two
melvilles
and
buchanan
nephew
thomas
went
to
see
him
in
edinburgh
in
september
hearing
that
he
was
ill
and
his
history
still
in
the
press
and
how
they
found
the
old
sage
true
to
his
schoolmaster
instincts
teaching
the
hornbook
to
his
and
how
he
told
them
that
doing
that
was
better
than
stealing
sheep
or
sitting
idle
which
was
as
bad
and
showed
them
that
dedication
to
james
in
which
he
holds
up
to
his
imitation
as
a
hero
whose
equal
was
hardly
to
be
found
in
history
that
very
king
david
whose
liberality
to
the
romish
church
provoked
james
witticism
that
david
was
a
sair
saint
for
the
crown
andrew
melville
so
james
melville
says
found
fault
with
the
style
buchanan
replied
that
he
could
do
no
more
for
thinking
of
another
thing
which
was
to
die
they
then
went
to
arbuthnot
and
inspected
the
history
as
far
as
that
terrible
passage
concerning
rizzio
burial
where
mary
is
represented
as
laying
the
miscreant
almost
in
the
arms
of
maud
de
valois
the
late
queen
alarmed
and
not
without
reason
at
such
plain
speaking
they
stopped
the
press
and
went
back
to
buchanan
house
buchanan
was
in
bed
he
was
going
he
said
the
way
of
welfare
they
asked
him
to
soften
the
passage
the
king
might
prohibit
the
whole
work
tell
me
man
said
buchanan
if
i
have
told
the
truth
they
could
not
or
would
not
deny
it
then
i
will
abide
his
feud
and
all
his
kin
pray
pray
to
god
for
me
and
let
him
direct
all
so
says
melville
by
the
printing
of
his
chronicle
was
ended
this
most
learned
wise
and
godly
man
ended
his
mortal
life
camden
has
a
hearsay
story
written
it
must
be
remembered
in
james
i
time
that
buchanan
on
his
repented
of
his
harsh
words
against
queen
mary
and
an
old
lady
rosyth
is
said
to
have
said
that
when
she
was
young
a
certain
david
buchanan
recollected
hearing
some
such
words
from
george
buchanan
own
mouth
those
who
will
may
read
what
ruddiman
and
love
have
said
and
oversaid
on
both
sides
of
the
question
whatever
conclusion
they
come
to
it
will
probably
not
be
that
to
which
george
chalmers
comes
in
his
life
of
ruddiman
that
buchanan
like
other
liars
who
by
the
repetition
of
falsehoods
are
induced
to
consider
the
fiction
as
truth
had
so
often
dwelt
with
complacency
on
the
forgeries
of
his
detections
and
the
figments
of
his
history
that
he
at
length
regarded
his
fictions
and
his
forgeries
as
most
authentic
facts
at
all
events
his
fictions
and
his
forgeries
had
not
paid
him
in
that
coin
which
base
men
generally
consider
the
only
coin
worth
having
namely
the
good
things
of
this
life
he
left
nothing
behind
him
if
at
least
irving
has
rightly
construed
the
testament
dative
which
he
gives
in
his
appendix
save
arrears
to
the
sum
of
of
his
crossraguel
pension
we
may
believe
as
we
choose
the
story
in
mackenzie
writers
that
when
he
felt
himself
dying
he
asked
his
servant
young
about
the
state
of
his
funds
and
finding
he
had
not
enough
to
bury
himself
withal
ordered
what
he
had
to
be
given
to
the
poor
and
said
that
if
they
did
not
choose
to
bury
him
they
might
let
him
lie
where
he
was
or
cast
him
in
a
ditch
the
matter
was
very
little
to
him
he
was
buried
it
seems
at
the
expense
of
the
city
of
edinburgh
in
the
greyfriars
churchyard
one
says
in
a
plain
turf
grave
among
the
marble
monuments
which
covered
the
bones
of
worse
or
meaner
men
and
whether
or
not
the
throughstone
which
sunk
under
the
ground
in
the
greyfriars
was
raised
and
cleaned
by
the
council
of
edinburgh
in
was
really
george
buchanan
the
reigning
powers
troubled
themselves
little
for
several
generations
where
he
lay
for
buchanan
politics
were
too
advanced
for
his
age
not
only
catholic
scotsmen
like
blackwood
winzet
and
ninian
but
protestants
like
sir
thomas
craig
and
sir
john
wemyss
could
not
stomach
the
jure
regni
they
may
have
had
some
reason
on
their
side
in
the
then
anarchic
state
of
scotland
organisation
and
unity
under
a
common
head
may
have
been
more
important
than
the
assertion
of
popular
rights
be
that
as
it
may
in
only
two
years
after
his
death
the
scots
parliament
condemned
his
dialogue
and
history
as
untrue
and
commanded
all
possessors
of
copies
to
deliver
them
up
that
they
might
be
purged
of
the
offensive
and
extraordinary
matters
which
they
contained
the
jure
regni
was
again
prohibited
in
scotland
in
even
in
manuscript
and
in
the
whole
of
buchanan
political
works
had
the
honour
of
being
burned
by
the
university
of
oxford
in
company
with
those
of
milton
languet
and
others
as
pernicious
books
and
damnable
doctrines
destructive
to
the
sacred
persons
of
princes
their
state
and
government
and
of
all
human
society
and
thus
the
seed
which
buchanan
had
sown
and
milton
had
watered
for
the
allegation
that
milton
borrowed
from
buchanan
is
probably
true
and
equally
honourable
to
both
lay
trampled
into
the
earth
and
seemingly
lifeless
till
it
tillered
out
and
blossomed
and
bore
fruit
to
a
good
purpose
in
the
revolution
of
to
buchanan
clear
head
and
stout
heart
scotland
owes
as
england
owes
likewise
much
of
her
modern
liberty
but
scotland
debt
to
him
it
seems
to
me
is
even
greater
on
the
count
of
morality
public
and
private
what
the
morality
of
the
scotch
upper
classes
was
like
in
buchanan
early
days
is
too
notorious
and
there
remains
proof
enough
in
the
writings
for
instance
of
sir
david
lindsay
that
the
morality
of
the
populace
which
looked
up
to
the
nobles
as
its
example
and
its
guide
was
not
a
whit
better
as
anarchy
increased
immorality
was
likely
to
increase
likewise
and
scotland
was
in
serious
danger
of
falling
into
such
a
state
as
that
into
which
poland
fell
to
its
ruin
within
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
in
which
the
savagery
of
feudalism
without
its
order
or
its
chivalry
would
be
varnished
over
by
a
thin
coating
of
french
civilisation
and
as
in
the
case
of
bothwell
the
vices
of
the
court
of
paris
should
be
added
to
those
of
the
northern
freebooter
to
deliver
scotland
from
that
ruin
it
was
needed
that
she
should
be
united
into
one
people
strong
not
in
mere
political
but
in
moral
ideas
strong
by
the
clear
sense
of
right
and
wrong
by
the
belief
in
the
government
and
the
judgments
of
a
living
god
and
the
tone
which
buchanan
like
knox
adopted
concerning
the
great
crimes
of
their
day
helped
notably
that
national
salvation
it
gathered
together
organised
strengthened
the
scattered
and
wavering
elements
of
public
morality
it
assured
the
hearts
of
all
men
who
loved
the
right
and
hated
the
wrong
and
taught
a
whole
nation
to
call
acts
by
their
just
names
whoever
might
be
the
doers
of
them
it
appealed
to
the
common
conscience
of
men
it
proclaimed
a
universal
and
morality
a
bar
at
which
all
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
must
alike
be
judged
the
tone
was
stern
but
there
was
need
of
sternness
moral
life
and
death
were
in
the
balance
if
the
scots
people
were
to
be
told
that
the
crimes
which
roused
their
indignation
were
excusable
or
beyond
punishment
or
to
be
hushed
up
and
slipped
over
in
any
way
there
was
an
end
of
morality
among
them
every
man
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
would
go
and
do
likewise
according
to
his
powers
of
evil
that
method
was
being
tried
in
france
and
in
spain
likewise
during
those
very
years
notorious
crimes
were
hushed
up
under
pretence
of
loyalty
excused
as
political
necessities
smiled
away
as
natural
and
pardonable
weaknesses
the
result
was
the
utter
demoralisation
both
of
france
and
spain
knox
and
buchanan
the
one
from
the
of
an
old
hebrew
prophet
the
other
rather
from
that
of
a
juvenal
or
a
tacitus
tried
the
other
method
and
called
acts
by
their
just
names
appealing
alike
to
conscience
and
to
god
the
result
was
virtue
and
piety
and
that
manly
independence
of
soul
which
is
thought
compatible
with
hearty
loyalty
in
a
country
labouring
under
heavy
disadvantages
long
divided
almost
into
two
hostile
camps
two
rival
races
and
the
good
influence
was
soon
manifest
not
only
in
those
who
sided
with
buchanan
and
his
friends
but
in
those
who
most
opposed
them
the
roman
catholic
preachers
who
at
first
asserted
mary
right
to
impunity
while
they
allowed
her
guilt
grew
silent
for
shame
and
set
themselves
to
assert
her
entire
innocence
while
the
scots
who
have
followed
their
example
have
to
their
honour
taken
up
the
same
ground
they
have
fought
buchanan
on
the
ground
of
fact
not
on
the
ground
of
morality
they
have
alleged
as
they
had
a
fair
right
to
do
the
probability
of
intrigue
and
forgery
in
an
age
so
profligate
the
improbability
that
a
queen
so
gifted
by
nature
and
by
fortune
and
confessedly
for
a
long
while
so
strong
and
so
spotless
should
as
it
were
by
a
sudden
insanity
have
proved
so
untrue
to
herself
their
noblest
and
purest
sympathies
have
been
enlisted
and
who
can
blame
them
in
loyalty
to
a
queen
chivalry
to
a
woman
pity
for
the
unfortunate
and
as
they
conceived
the
innocent
but
whether
they
have
been
right
or
wrong
in
their
view
of
facts
the
scotch
partisans
of
mary
have
always
as
far
as
i
know
been
right
in
their
view
of
morals
they
have
never
deigned
to
admit
guilt
and
then
to
palliate
it
by
those
sentimental
or
rather
sensual
theories
of
human
nature
too
common
in
a
certain
school
of
french
literature
too
common
alas
in
a
certain
school
of
modern
english
novels
they
have
not
said
she
did
it
but
after
all
was
the
deed
so
very
inexcusable
they
have
said
the
deed
was
inexcusable
but
she
did
not
do
it
and
so
the
scotch
admirers
of
mary
who
have
numbered
among
them
many
a
pure
and
noble
as
well
as
many
a
gifted
spirit
have
kept
at
least
themselves
unstained
and
have
shown
whether
consciously
or
not
that
they
too
share
in
that
sturdy
scotch
moral
sense
which
has
been
so
much
strengthened
as
i
believe
by
the
plain
speech
of
good
old
george
buchanan
rondelet
the
huguenot
naturalist
apollo
god
of
medicine
exiled
from
the
rest
of
the
earth
was
straying
once
across
the
narbonnaise
in
gaul
seeking
to
fix
his
abode
there
driven
from
asia
from
africa
and
from
the
rest
of
europe
he
wandered
through
all
the
towns
of
the
province
in
search
of
a
place
propitious
for
him
and
for
his
disciples
at
last
he
perceived
a
new
city
constructed
from
the
ruins
of
maguelonne
of
lattes
and
of
substantion
he
contemplated
long
its
site
its
aspect
its
neighbourhood
and
resolved
to
establish
on
this
hill
of
montpellier
a
temple
for
himself
and
his
priests
all
smiled
on
his
desires
by
the
genius
of
the
soil
by
the
character
of
the
inhabitants
no
town
is
more
fit
for
the
culture
of
letters
and
above
all
of
medicine
what
site
is
more
delicious
and
more
lovely
a
heaven
pure
and
smiling
a
city
built
with
magnificence
men
born
for
all
the
labours
of
the
intellect
all
around
vast
horizons
and
enchanting
sites
meadows
vines
olives
green
champaigns
mountains
and
hills
rivers
brooks
lagoons
and
the
sea
everywhere
a
luxuriant
vegetation
everywhere
the
richest
production
of
the
land
and
the
water
hail
to
thee
sweet
and
dear
city
hail
happy
abode
of
apollo
who
spreadest
afar
the
light
of
the
glory
of
thy
name
this
fine
tirade
says
maurice
raynaud
from
whose
charming
book
on
the
of
the
time
of
moliere
i
quote
is
not
as
one
might
think
the
translation
of
a
piece
of
poetry
it
is
simply
part
of
a
public
oration
by
francois
fanchon
one
of
the
most
illustrious
chancellors
of
the
faculty
of
medicine
of
montpellier
in
the
seventeenth
century
from
time
immemorial
he
says
faculty
of
montpellier
had
made
itself
remarkable
by
a
singular
mixture
of
the
sacred
and
the
profane
the
theses
which
were
sustained
there
began
by
an
invocation
to
god
the
blessed
virgin
and
luke
and
ended
by
these
words
thesis
will
be
sustained
in
the
sacred
temple
of
apollo
but
however
extravagant
chancellor
fanchon
praises
of
his
native
city
may
seem
they
are
really
not
exaggerated
the
narbonnaise
or
languedoc
is
perhaps
the
most
charming
district
of
charming
france
in
the
far
gleam
the
white
alps
in
the
far
the
white
pyrenees
and
from
the
purple
glens
and
yellow
downs
of
the
cevennes
on
the
northwest
the
herault
slopes
gently
down
towards
the
etangs
or
great
lagoons
and
the
vast
alluvial
flats
of
the
camargue
the
field
of
caius
marius
where
still
run
herds
of
horses
descended
from
some
ancient
roman
stock
while
beyond
all
glitters
the
blue
mediterranean
the
great
almond
orchards
each
one
sheet
of
colour
in
spring
the
mulberry
orchards
the
oliveyards
the
vineyards
cover
every
foot
of
available
upland
soil
save
where
the
rugged
and
arid
downs
are
sweet
with
a
thousand
odoriferous
plants
from
which
the
bees
extract
the
famous
white
honey
of
narbonne
the
native
flowers
and
shrubs
of
a
beauty
and
richness
rather
eastern
than
european
have
made
the
monspeliensis
and
with
it
the
names
of
rondelet
and
his
disciples
famous
among
botanists
and
the
strange
fish
and
shells
upon
its
shores
afforded
rondelet
materials
for
his
immortal
work
upon
the
of
the
sea
the
innumerable
wild
fowl
of
the
bouches
du
rhone
the
innumerable
songsters
and
other
birds
of
passage
many
of
them
unknown
in
these
islands
and
even
in
the
north
of
france
itself
which
haunt
every
copse
of
willow
and
aspen
along
the
brook
sides
the
gaudy
and
curious
insects
which
thrive
beneath
that
clear
fierce
and
yet
bracing
sunlight
all
these
have
made
the
district
of
montpellier
a
home
prepared
by
nature
for
those
who
study
and
revere
her
neither
was
chancellor
fanchon
misled
by
patriotism
when
he
said
the
pleasant
people
who
inhabit
that
district
are
fit
for
all
the
labours
of
the
intellect
they
are
a
very
mixed
race
and
like
most
mixed
races
and
handsome
also
there
is
probably
much
roman
blood
among
them
especially
in
the
towns
for
languedoc
or
gallia
narbonnensis
as
it
was
called
of
old
was
said
to
be
more
roman
than
rome
itself
the
roman
remains
are
more
perfect
and
more
interesting
so
the
late
whewell
used
to
say
than
any
to
be
seen
now
in
italy
and
the
old
capital
narbonne
itself
was
a
complete
museum
of
roman
antiquities
ere
francis
destroyed
it
in
order
to
fortify
the
city
upon
a
modern
system
against
the
invading
armies
of
charles
there
must
be
much
visigothic
blood
likewise
in
languedoc
for
the
visigothic
kings
held
their
courts
there
from
the
fifth
century
until
the
time
that
they
were
crushed
by
the
invading
moors
spanish
blood
likewise
there
may
be
for
much
of
languedoc
was
held
in
the
early
middle
age
by
those
descendants
of
eudes
of
acquitaine
who
established
themselves
as
kings
of
majorca
and
arragon
and
languedoc
did
not
become
entirely
french
till
when
philip
le
bel
bought
montpellier
of
those
potentates
the
moors
too
may
have
left
some
traces
of
their
race
behind
they
held
the
country
from
about
to
when
they
were
finally
expelled
by
charles
martel
and
eudes
one
sees
to
this
day
their
towers
of
meagre
perched
on
the
grand
roman
masonry
of
those
old
amphitheatres
which
they
turned
into
fortresses
one
may
see
too
so
tradition
holds
upon
those
very
amphitheatres
the
stains
of
the
fires
with
which
charles
martel
smoked
them
out
and
one
may
see
too
or
fancy
that
one
sees
in
the
aquiline
features
the
bright
black
eyes
the
lithe
and
graceful
gestures
which
are
so
common
in
languedoc
some
touch
of
the
old
mahommedan
race
which
passed
like
a
flood
over
that
christian
land
whether
or
not
the
moors
left
behind
any
traces
of
their
blood
they
left
behind
at
least
traces
of
their
learning
for
the
university
of
montpellier
claimed
to
have
been
founded
by
moors
at
a
date
of
altogether
abysmal
antiquity
they
looked
upon
the
arabian
physicians
of
the
middle
age
on
avicenna
and
averrhoes
as
modern
innovators
and
derived
their
parentage
from
certain
mythic
doctors
of
cordova
who
when
the
moors
were
expelled
from
spain
in
the
eighth
century
fled
to
montpellier
bringing
with
them
traditions
of
that
primeval
science
which
had
been
revealed
to
adam
while
still
in
paradise
and
founded
montpellier
the
mother
of
all
the
universities
in
europe
nay
some
went
further
still
and
told
of
bengessaus
and
ferragius
the
physicians
of
charlemagne
and
of
marilephus
chief
physician
of
king
chilperic
and
even
if
a
letter
of
bernard
was
to
be
believed
of
a
certain
bishop
who
went
as
early
as
the
second
century
to
consult
the
doctors
of
montpellier
and
it
would
have
been
in
vain
to
reply
to
them
that
in
those
days
and
long
after
them
montpellier
was
not
yet
built
the
facts
are
said
to
be
that
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
montpellier
had
its
schools
of
law
medicine
and
arts
which
were
erected
into
a
university
by
pope
nicholas
iv
in
the
university
of
montpellier
like
i
believe
most
foreign
ones
resembled
more
a
scotch
than
an
english
university
the
students
lived
for
the
most
part
not
in
colleges
but
in
private
lodgings
and
constituted
a
republic
of
their
own
ruled
by
an
abbe
of
the
scholars
one
of
themselves
chosen
by
universal
suffrage
a
terror
they
were
often
to
the
respectable
burghers
for
they
had
all
the
right
to
carry
arms
and
a
plague
likewise
for
if
they
ran
in
debt
their
creditors
were
forbidden
to
seize
their
books
which
with
their
swords
were
generally
all
the
property
they
possessed
if
moreover
any
one
set
up
a
noisy
or
unpleasant
trade
near
their
lodgings
the
scholars
could
compel
the
town
authorities
to
turn
him
out
they
were
most
of
them
probably
mere
boys
of
from
twelve
to
twenty
living
poorly
working
hard
and
those
at
least
of
them
who
were
in
the
colleges
cruelly
beaten
daily
after
the
fashion
of
those
times
but
they
seem
to
have
comforted
themselves
under
their
troubles
by
a
good
deal
of
wild
life
out
of
school
by
rambling
into
the
country
on
the
festivals
of
the
saints
and
now
and
then
by
acting
plays
notably
that
famous
one
which
rabelais
wrote
for
them
in
the
moral
comedy
of
the
man
who
had
a
dumb
wife
which
joyous
patelinage
remains
unto
this
day
in
the
shape
of
a
comic
song
that
comedy
young
rondelet
must
have
seen
acted
the
son
of
a
druggist
spicer
and
grocer
the
three
trades
were
then
combined
in
montpellier
and
born
in
he
had
been
destined
for
the
cloister
being
a
sickly
lad
his
uncle
one
of
the
canons
of
maguelonne
near
by
had
even
given
him
the
revenues
of
a
small
chapel
a
job
of
nepotism
which
was
common
enough
in
those
days
but
his
heart
was
in
science
and
medicine
he
set
off
still
a
mere
boy
to
paris
to
study
there
and
returned
to
montpellier
at
the
age
of
eighteen
to
study
again
the
next
year
while
still
a
scholar
himself
he
was
appointed
procurator
of
the
scholars
a
post
which
brought
him
in
a
small
fee
on
each
matriculation
and
that
year
he
took
a
fee
among
others
from
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
that
or
of
any
age
francois
rabelais
himself
and
what
shall
i
say
of
him
who
stands
alone
like
shakespeare
in
his
generation
possessed
of
colossal
learning
of
all
science
which
could
be
gathered
in
his
days
of
practical
and
statesmanlike
wisdom
of
knowledge
of
languages
ancient
and
modern
beyond
all
his
compeers
of
eloquence
which
when
he
speaks
of
pure
and
noble
things
becomes
heroic
and
as
it
were
inspired
of
scorn
for
meanness
hypocrisy
ignorance
of
esteem
genuine
and
earnest
for
the
holy
scriptures
and
for
the
more
moderate
of
the
reformers
who
were
spreading
the
scriptures
in
europe
and
all
this
great
light
wilfully
hidden
not
under
a
bushel
but
under
a
dunghill
he
is
somewhat
like
socrates
in
face
and
in
character
likewise
in
him
as
in
socrates
the
demigod
and
the
satyr
the
man
and
the
ape
are
struggling
for
the
mastery
in
socrates
the
true
man
conquers
and
comes
forth
high
and
pure
in
rabelais
alas
the
victor
is
the
ape
while
the
man
himself
sinks
down
in
cynicism
sensuality
practical
jokes
foul
talk
he
returns
to
paris
to
live
an
idle
luxurious
life
to
die
says
the
legend
saying
i
go
to
seek
a
great
perhaps
and
to
leave
behind
him
little
save
a
school
of
pantagruelists
careless
young
gentlemen
whose
ideal
was
to
laugh
at
everything
to
believe
in
nothing
and
to
gratify
their
five
senses
like
the
brutes
which
perish
there
are
those
who
read
his
books
to
make
them
laugh
the
wise
man
when
he
reads
them
will
be
far
more
inclined
to
weep
let
any
young
man
who
may
see
these
words
remember
that
in
him
as
in
rabelais
the
ape
and
the
man
are
struggling
for
the
mastery
let
him
take
warning
by
the
fate
of
one
who
was
to
him
as
a
giant
to
a
pigmy
and
think
of
tennyson
words
arise
and
fly
the
reeling
faun
the
sensual
feast
strive
upwards
working
out
the
beast
and
let
the
ape
and
tiger
die
but
to
return
down
among
them
there
at
montpellier
like
a
brilliant
meteor
flashed
this
wonderful
rabelais
in
the
year
he
had
fled
some
say
for
his
life
like
erasmus
he
had
no
mind
to
be
a
martyr
and
he
had
been
terrified
at
the
execution
of
poor
louis
de
berquin
his
friend
and
the
friend
of
erasmus
likewise
this
louis
de
berquin
a
man
well
known
in
those
days
was
a
gallant
young
gentleman
and
scholar
holding
a
place
in
the
court
of
francis
who
had
translated
into
french
the
works
of
erasmus
luther
and
melancthon
and
had
asserted
that
it
was
heretical
to
invoke
the
virgin
mary
instead
of
the
holy
spirit
or
to
call
her
our
hope
and
our
life
which
titles
berquin
averred
belonged
alone
to
god
twice
had
the
doctors
of
the
sorbonne
with
that
terrible
persecutor
noel
beda
at
their
head
seized
poor
berquin
and
tried
to
burn
his
books
and
him
twice
had
that
angel
in
human
form
marguerite
sister
of
francis
saved
him
from
their
clutches
but
when
francis
taken
prisoner
at
the
battle
of
pavia
at
last
returned
from
his
captivity
in
spain
the
suppression
of
heresy
and
the
burning
of
heretics
seemed
to
him
and
to
his
mother
louise
of
savoy
a
so
acceptable
to
god
that
louis
berquin
who
would
not
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
erasmus
purchase
his
life
by
silence
was
burnt
at
last
on
the
place
de
greve
being
first
strangled
because
he
was
of
gentle
blood
montpellier
received
its
famous
guest
joyfully
rabelais
was
now
two
years
old
and
a
distinguished
savant
so
they
excused
him
his
three
years
undergraduate
career
and
invested
him
at
once
with
the
red
gown
of
the
bachelors
that
red
gown
or
rather
the
ragged
phantom
of
it
is
still
shown
at
montpellier
and
must
be
worn
by
each
bachelor
when
he
takes
his
degree
unfortunately
antiquarians
assure
us
that
the
precious
garment
has
been
renewed
again
and
again
the
students
having
clipped
bits
of
it
away
for
relics
and
clipped
as
earnestly
from
the
new
gowns
as
their
predecessors
had
done
from
the
authentic
original
doubtless
the
coming
of
such
a
man
among
them
to
lecture
on
the
aphorisms
of
hippocrates
and
the
ars
parva
of
galen
not
from
the
latin
translations
then
in
use
but
from
original
greek
texts
with
comments
and
corrections
of
his
own
must
have
had
a
great
influence
on
the
minds
of
the
montpellier
students
and
still
more
influence
and
that
not
altogether
a
good
one
must
rabelais
lighter
talk
have
had
as
he
lounged
so
the
story
goes
in
his
upon
the
public
place
picking
up
quaint
stories
from
the
off
the
cevennes
and
the
villagers
who
came
in
to
sell
their
olives
and
their
grapes
their
vinegar
and
their
faggots
as
they
do
unto
this
day
to
him
may
be
owing
much
of
the
sound
respect
for
natural
science
and
much
too
of
the
contempt
for
the
superstition
around
them
which
is
notable
in
that
group
of
great
naturalists
who
were
boys
in
montpellier
at
that
day
rabelais
seems
to
have
liked
rondelet
and
no
wonder
he
was
a
cheery
lovable
honest
little
fellow
very
fond
of
jokes
a
great
musician
and
player
on
the
violin
and
who
when
he
grew
rich
liked
nothing
so
well
as
to
bring
into
his
house
any
buffoon
or
strolling
player
to
make
fun
for
him
vivacious
he
was
forgiving
and
with
a
power
of
learning
and
a
power
of
work
which
were
prodigious
even
in
those
days
rabelais
chaffs
rondelet
under
the
name
of
rondibilis
for
indeed
rondelet
grew
up
into
a
very
round
fat
little
man
but
rabelais
puts
excellent
sense
into
his
mouth
cynical
enough
and
too
cynical
but
both
learned
and
humorous
and
if
he
laughs
at
him
for
being
shocked
at
the
offer
of
a
fee
and
taking
it
nevertheless
kindly
enough
rondelet
is
not
the
first
doctor
who
has
done
that
neither
will
he
be
the
last
rondelet
in
his
turn
put
on
the
red
robe
of
the
bachelor
and
received
on
taking
his
degree
his
due
share
of
fisticuffs
from
his
dearest
friends
according
to
the
ancient
custom
of
the
university
of
montpellier
he
then
went
off
to
practise
medicine
in
a
village
at
the
foot
of
the
alps
and
to
teach
little
children
then
he
found
he
must
learn
greek
went
off
to
paris
a
second
time
and
alleviated
his
poverty
there
somewhat
by
becoming
tutor
to
a
son
of
the
viscomte
de
turenne
there
he
met
gonthier
of
andernach
who
had
taught
anatomy
at
louvain
to
the
great
vesalius
and
learned
from
him
to
dissect
we
next
find
him
setting
up
as
a
medical
man
amid
the
wild
volcanic
hills
of
the
auvergne
struggling
still
with
poverty
like
erasmus
like
george
buchanan
like
almost
every
great
scholar
in
those
days
for
students
then
had
to
wander
from
place
to
place
generally
on
foot
in
search
of
new
teachers
in
search
of
books
in
search
of
the
necessaries
of
life
undergoing
such
an
amount
of
bodily
and
mental
toil
as
makes
it
wonderful
that
all
of
them
did
not
as
some
of
them
doubtless
did
die
under
the
hard
training
or
at
best
desert
the
penurious
muses
for
the
paternal
shop
or
plough
rondelet
got
his
doctorate
in
and
next
year
fell
in
love
with
and
married
a
beautiful
young
girl
called
jeanne
sandre
who
seems
to
have
been
as
poor
as
he
but
he
had
gained
meanwhile
a
powerful
patron
and
the
patronage
of
the
great
was
then
as
necessary
to
men
of
letters
as
the
patronage
of
the
public
is
now
guillaume
pellicier
bishop
of
maguelonne
or
rather
then
of
montpellier
itself
whither
he
had
persuaded
paul
ii
to
transfer
the
ancient
see
was
a
model
of
the
literary
gentleman
of
the
sixteenth
century
a
savant
a
diplomat
a
collector
of
books
and
manuscripts
greek
hebrew
and
syriac
which
formed
the
original
nucleus
of
the
present
library
of
the
louvre
a
botanist
too
who
loved
to
wander
with
rondelet
collecting
plants
and
flowers
he
retired
from
public
life
to
peace
and
science
at
montpellier
when
to
the
evil
days
of
his
master
francis
succeeded
the
still
worse
days
of
henry
and
diana
of
poitiers
that
jezebel
of
france
could
conceive
no
more
natural
or
easy
way
of
atoning
for
her
own
sins
than
that
of
hunting
down
heretics
and
feasting
her
wicked
eyes
so
it
is
said
upon
their
dying
torments
bishop
pellicier
fell
under
suspicion
of
heresy
very
probably
with
some
justice
he
fell
too
under
suspicion
of
leading
a
life
unworthy
of
a
celibate
churchman
a
fault
which
if
it
really
existed
was
in
those
days
pardonable
enough
in
an
orthodox
prelate
but
not
so
in
one
whose
orthodoxy
was
suspected
and
for
a
while
pellicier
was
in
prison
after
his
release
he
gave
himself
up
to
science
with
rondelet
and
the
school
of
disciples
who
were
growing
up
around
him
they
rediscovered
together
the
garum
that
classic
sauce
whose
praises
had
been
sung
of
old
by
horace
martial
and
ausonius
and
so
childlike
superstitious
if
you
will
was
the
reverence
in
the
sixteenth
century
for
classic
antiquity
that
when
pellicier
and
rondelet
discovered
that
the
garum
was
made
from
the
fish
called
picarel
called
garon
by
the
fishers
of
antibes
and
giroli
at
venice
both
these
last
names
corruptions
of
the
latin
gerres
then
did
the
two
fashionable
poets
of
france
etienne
dolet
and
clement
marot
think
it
not
unworthy
of
their
muse
to
sing
the
praises
of
the
sauce
which
horace
had
sung
of
old
a
proud
day
too
was
it
for
pellicier
and
rondelet
when
wandering
somewhere
in
the
marshes
of
the
camargue
a
scent
of
garlic
caught
the
nostrils
of
the
gentle
bishop
and
in
the
lovely
pink
flowers
of
the
he
recognised
the
scordium
of
the
ancients
the
discovery
says
professor
planchon
made
almost
as
much
noise
as
that
of
the
famous
garum
for
at
that
moment
of
naive
fervour
on
behalf
of
antiquity
to
rediscover
a
plant
of
dioscorides
or
of
pliny
was
a
good
fortune
and
almost
an
event
i
know
not
whether
after
his
death
the
good
bishop
bones
reposed
beneath
some
gorgeous
tomb
bedizened
with
the
incongruous
statues
of
the
renaissance
but
this
at
least
is
certain
that
rondelet
disciples
imagined
for
him
a
monument
more
enduring
than
of
marble
or
of
brass
more
graceful
and
more
curiously
wrought
than
all
the
sculptures
of
torrigiano
or
cellini
baccio
bandinelli
or
michael
angelo
himself
for
they
named
a
lovely
little
lilac
snapdragon
domini
lord
pellicier
and
that
name
it
will
keep
we
may
believe
as
long
as
winter
and
summer
shall
endure
but
to
return
to
this
good
patron
who
was
the
ambassador
at
venice
the
rondelet
determined
to
apply
for
employment
and
to
venice
he
would
have
gone
leaving
his
bride
behind
had
he
not
been
stayed
by
one
of
those
angels
who
sometimes
walk
the
earth
in
women
shape
jeanne
sandre
had
an
elder
sister
catherine
who
had
brought
her
up
she
was
married
to
a
wealthy
man
but
she
had
no
children
of
her
own
for
four
years
she
and
her
good
husband
had
let
the
rondelets
lodge
with
them
and
now
she
was
a
widow
and
to
part
with
them
was
more
than
she
could
bear
she
carried
rondelet
off
from
the
students
who
were
seeing
him
safe
out
of
the
city
brought
him
back
settled
on
him
the
same
day
half
her
fortune
and
soon
after
settled
on
him
the
whole
on
the
sole
condition
that
she
should
live
with
him
and
her
sister
for
years
afterwards
she
watched
over
the
pretty
young
wife
and
her
two
girls
and
three
boys
the
three
boys
alas
all
died
young
and
over
rondelet
himself
who
immersed
in
books
and
experiments
was
utterly
careless
about
money
and
was
to
them
all
a
mother
advising
guiding
managing
and
regarded
by
rondelet
with
genuine
gratitude
as
his
guardian
angel
honour
and
good
fortune
in
the
worldly
sense
now
poured
in
upon
the
druggist
son
pellicier
his
own
bishop
stood
godfather
to
his
born
daughter
montluc
bishop
of
valence
and
that
wise
and
learned
statesman
the
cardinal
of
tournon
stood
godfathers
a
few
years
later
to
his
twin
boys
and
what
was
of
still
more
solid
worth
to
him
cardinal
tournon
took
him
to
antwerp
bordeaux
bayonne
and
more
than
once
to
rome
and
in
these
italian
journeys
of
his
he
collected
many
facts
for
the
great
work
of
his
life
that
of
fishes
which
he
dedicated
naturally
enough
to
the
cardinal
this
book
with
its
plates
is
for
the
time
a
masterpiece
of
accuracy
those
who
are
best
acquainted
with
the
subject
say
that
it
is
up
to
the
present
day
a
key
to
the
whole
ichthyology
of
the
mediterranean
two
other
men
belon
and
salviani
were
then
at
work
on
the
same
subject
and
published
their
books
almost
at
the
same
time
a
circumstance
which
caused
as
was
natural
a
cornered
duel
between
the
supporters
of
the
three
naturalists
each
party
accusing
the
other
of
plagiarism
the
simple
fact
seems
to
be
that
the
almost
simultaneous
appearance
of
the
three
books
in
is
one
of
those
coincidences
inevitable
at
moments
when
many
minds
are
stirred
in
the
same
direction
by
the
same
great
thoughts
coincidences
which
have
happened
in
our
own
day
on
questions
of
geology
biology
and
astronomy
and
which
when
the
facts
have
been
carefully
examined
and
the
first
flush
of
natural
jealousy
has
cooled
down
have
proved
only
that
there
were
more
wise
men
than
one
in
the
world
at
the
same
time
and
this
sixteenth
century
was
an
age
in
which
the
minds
of
men
were
suddenly
and
strangely
turned
to
examine
the
wonders
of
nature
with
an
earnestness
with
a
reverence
and
therefore
with
an
accuracy
with
which
they
had
never
been
investigated
before
nature
says
professor
planchon
long
veiled
in
mysticism
and
scholasticism
was
opening
up
infinite
vistas
a
new
superstition
the
exaggerated
worship
of
the
ancients
was
nearly
hindering
this
movement
of
thought
towards
facts
nevertheless
learning
did
her
work
she
rediscovered
reconstructed
purified
commented
on
the
texts
of
ancient
authors
then
came
in
observation
which
showed
that
more
was
to
be
seen
in
one
blade
of
grass
than
in
any
page
of
pliny
rondelet
was
in
the
middle
of
this
crisis
a
man
of
transition
while
he
was
one
of
progress
he
reflected
the
past
he
opened
and
prepared
the
future
if
he
commented
on
dioscorides
if
he
remained
faithful
to
the
theories
of
galen
he
founded
in
his
of
fishes
a
monument
which
our
century
respects
he
is
above
all
an
inspirer
an
initiator
and
if
he
wants
one
mark
of
the
leader
of
a
school
the
foundation
of
certain
scientific
doctrines
there
is
in
his
speech
what
is
better
than
all
systems
the
communicative
power
which
urges
a
generation
of
disciples
along
the
path
of
independent
research
with
reason
for
guide
and
faith
for
aim
around
rondelet
in
those
years
sometimes
indeed
in
his
house
for
professors
in
those
days
took
private
pupils
as
lodgers
worked
the
group
of
botanists
whom
linnaeus
calls
the
fathers
the
authors
of
the
descriptive
botany
of
the
sixteenth
century
their
names
and
those
of
their
disciples
and
their
disciples
again
are
household
words
in
the
mouth
of
every
gardener
immortalised
like
good
bishop
pellicier
in
the
plants
which
have
been
named
after
them
the
lobelia
commemorates
lobel
one
of
rondelet
most
famous
pupils
who
wrote
those
which
contain
so
many
curious
sketches
of
rondelet
botanical
expeditions
and
who
inherited
his
botanical
as
joubert
his
biographer
inherited
his
anatomical
manuscripts
the

commemorates

immortalizes
the
great
clusius
charles
de
citizen
of
arras
who
after
studying
civil
law
at
louvain
philosophy
at
marburg
and
theology
at
wittemberg
under
melancthon
came
to
montpellier
in
to
live
in
rondelet
own
house
and
become
the
greatest
botanist
of
his
age
these
were
rondelet
palmy
days
he
had
got
a
theatre
of
anatomy
built
at
montpellier
where
he
himself
dissected
publicly
he
had
says
tradition
a
little
botanic
garden
such
as
were
springing
up
then
in
several
universities
specially
in
italy
he
had
a
villa
outside
the
city
whose
tower
near
the
modern
railway
station
still
bears
the
name
of
the
mas
de
rondelet
there
too
may
be
seen
the
remnants
of
the
great
tanks
fed
with
water
brought
through
earthen
pipes
from
the
fountain
of
albe
wherein
he
kept
the
fish
whose
habits
he
observed
professor
planchon
thinks
that
he
had
tanks
likewise
and
thus
he
may
have
been
the
father
of
all
aquariums
he
had
a
large
and
handsome
house
in
the
city
itself
a
large
practice
as
physician
in
the
country
round
money
flowed
in
fast
to
him
and
flowed
out
fast
likewise
he
spent
much
upon
building
pulling
down
rebuilding
and
sent
the
bills
in
seemingly
to
his
wife
and
to
his
guardian
angel
catherine
he
himself
had
never
a
penny
in
his
purse
but
earned
the
money
and
let
his
ladies
spend
it
an
equitable
and
pleasant
division
of
labour
which
most
married
men
would
do
well
to
imitate
a
generous
affectionate
careless
little
man
he
gave
away
says
his
pupil
and
biographer
joubert
his
valuable
specimens
to
any
savant
who
begged
for
them
or
left
them
about
to
be
stolen
by
visitors
who
like
too
many
collectors
in
all
ages
possessed
light
fingers
and
lighter
consciences
so
pacific
was
he
meanwhile
and
so
brave
withal
that
even
in
the
fearful
years
of
the
troubles
he
would
never
carry
sword
nor
even
tuck
or
dagger
but
went
about
on
the
most
lonesome
journeys
as
one
who
wore
a
charmed
life
secure
in
god
and
in
his
calling
which
was
to
heal
and
not
to
kill
these
were
the
golden
years
of
rondelet
life
but
trouble
was
coming
on
him
and
a
stormy
sunset
after
a
brilliant
day
he
lost
his
law
to
whom
he
owed
all
his
fortunes
and
who
had
watched
ever
since
over
him
and
his
wife
like
a
mother
then
he
lost
his
wife
herself
under
most
painful
circumstances
then
his
daughter
then
he
married
again
and
lost
the
son
who
was
born
to
him
and
then
came
as
to
many
of
the
best
in
those
days
even
sorer
trials
trials
of
the
conscience
trials
of
faith
for
in
the
mean
time
rondelet
had
become
a
protestant
like
many
of
the
wisest
men
round
him
like
so
it
would
seem
from
the
event
the
majority
of
the
university
and
the
burghers
of
montpellier
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
montpellier
was
a
sort
of
for
protestant
preachers
whether
fugitive
or
not
who
were
passing
from
basle
geneva
or
lyons
to
marguerite
of
navarre
little
protestant
court
at
pau
or
at
nerac
where
all
wise
and
good
men
and
now
and
then
some
foolish
and
fanatical
ones
found
shelter
and
hospitality
thither
calvin
himself
had
been
passing
probably
through
montpellier
and
leaving
as
such
a
man
was
sure
to
leave
the
mark
of
his
foot
behind
him
at
lyons
no
great
distance
up
the
rhone
marguerite
had
helped
to
establish
an
organised
protestant
community
and
when
in
she
herself
had
passed
through
montpellier
to
visit
her
brother
at
valence
and
montmorency
camp
at
avignon
she
took
with
her
doubtless
protestant
chaplains
of
her
own
who
spoke
wise
words
it
may
be
that
she
spoke
wise
words
herself
to
the
ardent
and
inquiring
students
of
montpellier
moreover
rondelet
and
his
disciples
had
been
for
years
past
in
constant
communication
with
the
protestant
savants
of
switzerland
and
germany
among
whom
the
knowledge
of
nature
was
progressing
as
it
never
had
progressed
before
for
it
is
a
fact
always
to
be
remembered
it
was
only
in
the
free
air
of
protestant
countries
the
natural
sciences
could
grow
and
thrive
they
sprung
up
indeed
in
italy
after
the
restoration
of
greek
literature
in
the
fifteenth
century
but
they
withered
there
again
only
too
soon
under
the
blighting
upas
shade
of
superstition
transplanted
to
the
free
air
of
switzerland
of
germany
of
britain
and
of
montpellier
then
half
protestant
they
developed
rapidly
and
surely
simply
because
the
air
was
free
to
be
checked
again
in
france
by
the
return
of
superstition
with
despotism
until
the
eve
of
the
great
french
revolution
so
rondelet
had
been
for
some
years
protestant
he
had
hidden
in
his
house
for
a
long
while
a
monk
who
had
left
his
monastery
he
had
himself
written
theological
treatises
but
when
his
bishop
pellicier
was
imprisoned
on
a
charge
of
heresy
rondelet
burnt
his
manuscripts
and
kept
his
opinions
to
himself
still
he
was
a
suspected
heretic
at
last
seemingly
a
notorious
one
for
only
the
year
before
his
death
going
to
visit
patients
at
perpignan
he
was
waylaid
by
the
spaniards
and
had
to
get
home
through
bypasses
of
the
pyrenees
to
avoid
being
thrown
into
the
inquisition
and
those
were
times
in
which
it
was
necessary
for
a
man
to
be
careful
unless
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
burned
for
more
than
thirty
years
of
rondelet
life
the
burning
had
gone
on
in
his
neighbourhood
intermittently
it
is
true
the
spasms
of
superstitious
fury
being
succeeded
one
may
charitably
hope
by
pity
and
remorse
but
still
the
burnings
had
gone
on
the
benedictine
monk
of
maur
who
writes
the
history
of
languedoc
says
quite
how
some
one
was
burnt
at
toulouse
in
luckily
only
in
effigy
for
he
had
escaped
to
geneva
but
he
adds
next
year
they
burned
several
heretics
it
being
not
worth
while
to
mention
their
names
in
they
burned
alive
at
toulouse
jean
escalle
a
poor
franciscan
monk
who
had
found
his
order
intolerable
while
one
pierre
de
lavaur
who
dared
preach
calvinism
in
the
streets
of
nismes
was
hanged
and
burnt
so
had
the
score
of
judicial
murders
been
increasing
year
by
year
till
it
had
to
be
as
all
evil
scores
have
to
be
in
this
world
paid
off
with
interest
and
paid
off
especially
against
the
ignorant
and
fanatic
monks
who
for
a
whole
generation
in
every
university
and
school
in
france
had
been
howling
down
sound
science
as
well
as
sound
religion
and
at
montpellier
in
their
debt
was
paid
them
in
a
very
ugly
way
news
came
down
to
the
hot
southerners
of
languedoc
of
the
conspiracy
of
how
the
duc
de
guise
and
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
had
butchered
the
best
blood
in
france
under
the
pretence
of
a
treasonable
plot
how
the
king
of
navarre
and
the
prince
de
conde
had
been
arrested
then
how
conde
and
coligny
were
ready
to
take
up
arms
at
the
head
of
all
the
huguenots
of
france
and
try
to
stop
this
lifelong
torturing
by
sharp
shot
and
cold
steel
then
how
in
six
months
time
the
king
would
assemble
a
general
council
to
settle
the
question
between
catholics
and
huguenots
the
huguenots
guessing
how
that
would
end
resolved
to
settle
the
question
for
themselves
they
rose
in
one
city
after
another
sacked
the
churches
destroyed
the
images
put
down
by
main
force
superstitious
processions
and
dances
and
did
many
things
only
to
be
excused
by
the
exasperation
caused
by
thirty
years
of
cruelty
at
montpellier
there
was
hard
fighting
murders
so
say
the
catholic
historians
of
priests
and
monks
sack
of
the
new
cathedral
destruction
of
the
noble
convents
which
lay
in
a
ring
round
montpellier
the
city
and
the
university
were
in
the
hands
of
the
huguenots
and
montpellier
became
protestant
on
the
spot
next
year
came
the
counter
blow
there
were
heavy
battles
with
the
catholics
all
round
the
neighbourhood
destruction
of
the
suburbs
threatened
siege
and
sack
and
years
of
misery
and
poverty
for
montpellier
and
all
who
were
therein
horrible
was
the
state
of
france
in
those
times
of
the
wars
of
religion
which
began
in
the
times
which
are
spoken
of
usually
as
the
troubles
as
if
men
did
not
wish
to
allude
to
them
too
openly
then
and
afterwards
in
the
wars
of
the
league
deeds
were
done
for
which
language
has
no
name
the
population
decreased
the
land
lay
untilled
the
fair
face
of
france
was
blackened
with
burnt
homesteads
and
ruined
towns
ghastly
corpses
dangled
in
rows
upon
the
trees
or
floated
down
the
streams
law
and
order
were
at
an
end
bands
of
robbers
prowled
in
open
day
and
bands
of
wolves
likewise
but
all
through
the
horrors
of
the
troubles
we
catch
sight
of
the
little
fat
doctor
riding
all
unarmed
to
see
his
patients
throughout
languedoc
going
vast
distances
his
biographers
say
by
means
of
regular
relays
of
horses
till
he
too
broke
down
well
for
him
perhaps
that
he
broke
down
when
he
did
for
capture
and
recapture
massacre
and
pestilence
were
the
fate
of
montpellier
and
the
surrounding
country
till
the
better
times
of
henry
iv
and
the
edict
of
nantes
in
when
liberty
of
worship
was
given
to
the
protestants
for
a
while
in
the
burning
summer
of
rondeletius
went
a
long
journey
to
toulouse
seemingly
upon
an
errand
of
charity
to
settle
some
law
affairs
for
his
relations
the
sanitary
state
of
the
southern
cities
is
bad
enough
still
it
must
have
been
horrible
in
those
days
of
barbarism
and
misrule
dysentery
was
epidemic
at
toulouse
then
and
rondelet
took
it
he
knew
from
the
first
that
he
should
die
he
was
worn
out
it
is
said
by
by
sorrow
for
the
miseries
of
the
land
by
fruitless
struggles
to
keep
the
peace
and
to
strive
for
moderation
in
days
when
men
were
all
immoderate
but
he
rode
away
a
day
journey
he
took
two
days
over
it
so
weak
he
was
in
the
blazing
july
sun
to
a
friend
sick
wife
at
realmont
and
there
took
to
his
bed
and
died
a
good
man
death
the
details
of
his
death
and
last
illness
were
written
and
published
by
his
cousin
claude
formy
and
well
worth
reading
they
are
to
any
man
who
wishes
to
know
how
to
die
rondelet
would
have
no
tidings
of
his
illness
sent
to
montpellier
he
was
happy
he
said
in
dying
away
from
the
tears
of
his
household
and
safe
from
insult
he
dreaded
one
may
suppose
lest
priests
and
friars
should
force
their
way
to
his
bedside
and
try
to
extort
some
recantation
from
the
great
savant
the
honour
and
glory
of
their
city
so
they
sent
for
no
priest
to
realmont
but
round
his
bed
a
knot
of
calvinist
gentlemen
and
ministers
read
the
scriptures
and
sang
david
psalms
and
prayed
and
rondelet
prayed
with
them
through
long
agonies
and
so
went
home
to
god
the
benedictine
of
languedoc
in
all
his
voluminous
folios
never
mentions
as
far
as
i
can
find
rondelet
existence
why
should
he
the
man
was
only
a
druggist
son
and
a
heretic
who
healed
diseases
and
collected
plants
and
wrote
a
book
on
fish
but
the
learned
men
of
montpellier
and
of
all
europe
had
a
very
different
opinion
of
him
his
body
was
buried
at
realmont
but
before
the
schools
of
toulouse
they
set
up
a
white
marble
slab
and
an
inscription
thereon
setting
forth
his
learning
and
his
virtues
and
epitaphs
on
him
were
composed
by
the
learned
throughout
europe
not
only
in
french
and
latin
but
in
greek
hebrew
and
even
chaldee
so
lived
and
so
died
a
noble
man
more
noble
to
my
mind
than
many
a
victorious
warrior
or
successful
statesman
or
canonised
saint
to
know
facts
and
to
heal
diseases
were
the
two
objects
of
his
life
for
them
he
toiled
as
few
men
have
toiled
and
he
died
in
harness
at
his
work
the
best
death
any
man
can
die
vesalius
the
anatomist
i
can
not
begin
a
sketch
of
the
life
of
this
great
man
better
than
by
trying
to
describe
a
scene
so
picturesque
so
tragic
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
are
wont
to
mourn
over
human
follies
so
comic
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
prefer
to
laugh
over
them
that
the
reader
will
not
be
likely
to
forget
either
it
or
the
actors
in
it
it
is
a
darkened
chamber
in
the
college
of
alcala
in
the
year
where
lies
probably
in
a
huge
bed
shrouded
in
stifling
hangings
the
of
the
greatest
empire
in
the
then
world
don
carlos
only
son
of
philip
and
of
spain
the
netherlands
and
all
the
indies
a
short
sickly
boy
of
sixteen
with
a
bull
head
a
crooked
shoulder
a
short
leg
and
a
brutal
temper
he
will
not
be
missed
by
the
world
if
he
should
die
his
profligate
career
seems
to
have
brought
its
own
punishment
to
the
scandal
of
his
father
who
tolerated
no
one
vices
save
his
own
as
well
as
to
the
scandal
of
the
university
authorities
of
alcala
he
has
been
scouring
the
streets
at
the
head
of
the
most
profligate
students
insulting
women
even
ladies
of
rank
and
amenable
only
to
his
lovely
young
stepmother
elizabeth
of
valois
isabel
de
la
paz
as
the
spaniards
call
her
the
daughter
of
catherine
de
medicis
and
sister
of
the
king
of
france
don
carlos
should
have
married
her
had
not
his
worthy
father
found
it
more
advantageous
for
the
crown
of
spain
as
well
as
more
pleasant
for
him
philip
to
marry
her
himself
whence
came
rage
jealousies
romances
calumnies
of
which
two
last
in
as
far
at
least
as
they
concern
poor
elizabeth
no
wise
man
now
believes
a
word
going
on
some
errand
on
which
he
had
no
business
there
are
two
stories
neither
of
them
creditable
nor
necessary
to
repeat
don
carlos
has
fallen
down
stairs
and
broken
his
head
he
comes
by
his
portuguese
side
of
a
house
deeply
tainted
with
insanity
and
such
an
injury
may
have
serious
consequences
however
for
nine
days
the
wound
goes
on
well
and
don
carlos
having
had
a
wholesome
fright
is
according
to
doctor
olivarez
the
de
a
very
good
lad
and
lives
on
chicken
broth
and
dried
plums
but
on
the
tenth
day
comes
on
numbness
of
the
left
side
acute
pains
in
the
head
and
then
gradually
shivering
high
fever
erysipelas
his
head
and
neck
swell
to
an
enormous
size
then
comes
raging
delirium
then
stupefaction
and
don
carlos
lies
as
one
dead
a
modern
surgeon
would
probably
thanks
to
that
training
of
which
vesalius
may
be
almost
called
the
father
have
had
little
difficulty
in
finding
out
what
was
the
matter
with
the
luckless
lad
and
little
difficulty
in
removing
the
evil
if
it
had
not
gone
too
far
but
the
spanish
physicians
were
then
as
many
of
them
are
said
to
be
still
as
far
behind
the
world
in
surgery
as
in
other
things
and
indeed
surgery
itself
was
then
in
its
infancy
because
men
ever
since
the
early
greek
schools
of
alexandria
had
died
out
had
been
for
centuries
feeding
their
minds
with
anything
rather
than
with
facts
therefore
the
learned
morosophs
who
were
gathered
round
don
carlos
sick
bed
had
become
according
to
their
own
confession
utterly
confused
terrified
and
at
their
wits
end
it
is
the
of
may
the
eighteenth
day
after
the
accident
according
to
olivarez
story
he
and
vega
have
been
bleeding
the
unhappy
prince
enlarging
the
wound
twice
and
torturing
him
seemingly
on
mere
guesses
i
believe
says
olivarez
that
all
was
done
well
but
as
i
have
said
in
wounds
in
the
head
there
are
strange
labyrinths
so
on
the
they
stand
round
the
bed
in
despair
don
garcia
de
toledo
the
faithful
governor
is
sitting
by
him
worn
out
with
sleepless
nights
and
trying
to
supply
to
the
poor
boy
that
mother
tenderness
which
he
has
never
known
alva
too
is
there
stern
most
terrible
and
yet
most
beautiful
he
has
a
god
on
earth
and
that
is
philip
his
master
and
though
he
has
borne
much
from
don
carlos
already
and
will
have
to
bear
more
yet
the
wretched
lad
is
to
him
as
a
son
of
god
a
second
deity
who
will
by
right
divine
succeed
to
the
inheritance
of
the
first
and
he
watches
this
lesser
deity
struggling
between
life
and
death
with
an
intensity
of
which
we
in
these
less
loyal
days
can
form
no
notion
one
would
be
glad
to
have
a
glimpse
of
what
passed
through
that
mind
so
subtle
and
so
ruthless
so
disciplined
and
so
loyal
withal
but
alva
was
a
man
who
was
not
given
to
speak
his
mind
but
to
act
it
one
would
wish
too
for
a
glimpse
of
what
was
passing
through
the
mind
of
another
man
who
has
been
daily
in
that
sick
chamber
according
to
olivarez
statement
since
the
first
of
the
month
but
he
is
one
who
has
had
for
some
years
past
even
more
reason
than
alva
for
not
speaking
his
mind
what
he
looked
like
we
know
well
for
titian
has
painted
him
from
the
life
a
tall
bold
man
with
a
noble
brain
square
and
yet
lofty
short
curling
locks
and
beard
an
eye
which
looks
as
though
it
feared
neither
man
nor
fiend
and
it
has
had
good
reason
to
fear
both
and
features
which
would
be
exceeding
handsome
but
for
the
defiant
that
is
andreas
vesalius
of
brussels
dreaded
and
hated
by
the
doctors
of
the
old
school
suspect
moreover
it
would
seem
to
inquisitors
and
theologians
possibly
to
alva
himself
for
he
has
dared
to
dissect
human
bodies
he
has
insulted
the
medievalists
at
paris
padua
bologna
pisa
venice
in
open
theatre
he
has
turned
the
heads
of
all
the
young
surgeons
in
italy
and
france
he
has
written
a
great
book
with
prints
in
it
designed
some
say
by
titian
they
were
actually
done
by
another
netherlander
john
of
calcar
near
cleves
in
which
he
has
dared
to
prove
that
galen
anatomy
was
at
fault
throughout
and
that
he
had
been
describing
a
monkey
inside
when
he
had
pretended
to
be
describing
a
man
and
thus
by
impudence
and
quackery
he
has
wormed
himself
this
netherlander
a
heretic
at
heart
as
all
netherlanders
are
to
god
as
well
as
to
galen
into
the
confidence
of
the
late
emperor
charles
and
gone
campaigning
with
him
as
one
of
his
physicians
anatomising
human
bodies
even
on
the
and
defacing
the
likeness
of
deity
and
worse
than
that
the
most
religious
king
philip
is
deceived
by
him
likewise
and
keeps
him
in
madrid
in
wealth
and
honour
and
now
in
the
prince
extreme
danger
the
king
has
actually
sent
for
him
and
bidden
him
try
his
skill
a
man
who
knows
nothing
save
about
bones
and
muscles
and
the
outside
of
the
body
and
is
unworthy
the
name
of
a
true
physician
one
can
conceive
the
rage
of
the
old
spanish
pedants
at
the
netherlander
appearance
and
still
more
at
what
followed
if
we
are
to
believe
hugo
bloet
of
delft
his
countryman
and
contemporary
vesalius
he
says
saw
that
the
surgeons
had
bound
up
the
wound
so
tight
that
an
abscess
had
formed
outside
the
skull
which
could
not
break
he
asserted
that
the
only
hope
lay
in
opening
it
and
did
so
philip
having
given
leave
by
two
then
the
lad
returned
to
himself
as
if
awakened
from
a
profound
sleep
affirming
that
he
owed
his
restoration
to
life
to
the
german
doctor
dionysius
daza
who
was
there
with
the
other
physicians
and
surgeons
tells
a
different
story
the
most
learned
famous
and
rare
baron
vesalius
he
says
advised
that
the
skull
should
be
trepanned
but
his
advice
was
not
followed
olivarez
account
agrees
with
that
of
daza
they
had
opened
the
wounds
he
says
down
to
the
skull
before
vesalius
came
vesalius
insisted
that
the
injury
lay
inside
the
skull
and
wished
to
pierce
it
olivarez
spends
much
labour
in
proving
that
vesalius
had
no
great
foundation
for
his
opinion
but
confesses
that
he
never
changed
that
opinion
to
the
last
though
all
the
spanish
doctors
were
against
him
then
on
the
he
says
the
bachelor
torres
came
from
madrid
and
advised
that
the
skull
should
be
laid
bare
once
more
and
on
the
there
being
still
doubt
whether
the
skull
was
not
injured
the
operation
was
performed
by
whom
it
is
not
said
but
without
any
good
result
or
according
to
olivarez
any
discovery
save
that
vesalius
was
wrong
and
the
skull
uninjured
whether
this
second
operation
of
the
of
may
was
performed
by
vesalius
and
whether
it
was
that
of
which
bloet
speaks
is
an
open
question
olivarez
whole
relation
is
apologetic
written
to
justify
himself
and
his
seven
spanish
colleagues
and
to
prove
vesalius
in
the
wrong
public
opinion
he
confesses
had
been
very
fierce
against
him
the
credit
of
spanish
medicine
was
at
stake
and
we
are
not
bound
to
believe
implicitly
a
paper
drawn
up
under
such
circumstances
for
eye
this
at
least
we
gather
that
don
carlos
was
never
trepanned
as
is
commonly
said
and
this
also
that
whichever
of
the
two
stories
is
true
equally
puts
vesalius
into
direct
and
most
unpleasant
antagonism
to
the
spanish
doctors
but
don
carlos
still
lay
senseless
and
yielding
to
popular
clamour
the
doctors
called
in
the
aid
of
a
certain
moorish
doctor
from
valencia
named
priotarete
whose
unguents
it
was
reported
had
achieved
many
miraculous
cures
the
unguent
however
to
the
horror
of
the
doctors
burned
the
skull
till
the
bone
was
as
black
as
the
colour
of
ink
and
olivarez
declares
he
believes
it
to
have
been
a
preparation
of
pure
caustic
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
the
moor
and
his
unguents
were
sent
away
and
went
to
madrid
to
send
to
heaven
hernando
de
vega
while
the
prince
went
back
to
our
method
of
cure
considering
what
happened
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
we
should
now
presume
that
the
second
opening
of
the
abscess
whether
by
vesalius
or
someone
else
relieved
the
pressure
on
the
brain
that
a
critical
period
of
exhaustion
followed
probably
prolonged
by
the
moor
premature
caustic
which
stopped
the
suppuration
but
that
god
good
handiwork
called
nature
triumphed
at
last
and
that
therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
the
prince
was
out
of
danger
within
three
days
of
the
operation
but
he
was
taught
it
seems
to
attribute
his
recovery
to
a
very
different
source
from
that
of
a
german
knife
for
on
the
morning
of
the
when
the
moor
was
gone
and
don
carlos
lay
seemingly
lifeless
there
descended
into
his
chamber
a
deus
e
machina
or
rather
a
whole
pantheon
of
greater
or
lesser
deities
who
were
to
effect
that
which
medical
skill
seemed
not
to
have
effected
philip
sent
into
the
prince
chamber
several
of
the
precious
relics
which
he
usually
carried
about
with
him
the
miraculous
image
of
the
virgin
of
atocha
in
embroidering
garments
for
whom
spanish
royalty
male
and
female
has
spent
so
many
an
hour
ere
now
was
brought
in
solemn
procession
and
placed
on
an
altar
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
in
the
afternoon
there
entered
with
a
procession
likewise
a
shrine
containing
the
bones
of
a
holy
anchorite
one
fray
diego
whose
life
and
miracles
says
olivarez
are
so
notorious
and
the
bones
of
justus
and
pastor
the
tutelar
saints
of
the
university
of
alcala
amid
solemn
litanies
the
relics
of
fray
diego
were
laid
upon
the
prince
pillow
and
the
sudarium
or
mortuary
cloth
which
had
covered
his
face
was
placed
upon
the
prince
forehead
modern
science
might
object
that
the
presence
of
so
many
personages
however
pious
or
well
intentioned
in
a
sick
chamber
on
a
hot
spanish
may
day
especially
as
the
bath
had
been
for
some
generations
past
held
in
religious
horror
throughout
spain
as
a
sign
of
moorish
and
mussulman
tendencies
might
have
somewhat
interfered
with
the
chances
of
the
poor
boy
recovery
nevertheless
the
event
seems
to
have
satisfied
highest
hopes
for
that
same
night
so
don
carlos
afterwards
related
the
holy
monk
diego
appeared
to
him
in
a
vision
wearing
the
habit
of
francis
and
bearing
in
his
hand
a
cross
of
reeds
tied
with
a
green
band
the
prince
stated
that
he
first
took
the
apparition
to
be
that
of
the
blessed
francis
but
not
seeing
the
stigmata
he
exclaimed
how
dost
thou
not
bear
the
marks
of
the
wounds
what
he
replied
don
carlos
did
not
recollect
save
that
he
consoled
him
and
told
him
that
he
should
not
die
of
that
malady
philip
had
returned
to
madrid
and
shut
himself
up
in
grief
in
the
great
jeronymite
monastery
elizabeth
was
praying
for
her
before
the
miraculous
images
of
the
same
city
during
the
night
of
the
of
may
prayers
went
up
for
don
carlos
in
all
the
churches
of
toledo
alcala
and
madrid
alva
stood
all
that
night
at
the
bed
foot
don
garcia
de
toledo
sat
in
the
where
he
had
now
sat
night
and
day
for
more
than
a
fortnight
the
good
preceptor
honorato
juan
afterwards
bishop
of
osma
wrestled
in
prayer
for
the
lad
the
whole
night
through
his
prayer
was
answered
probably
it
had
been
answered
already
without
his
being
aware
of
it
be
that
as
it
may
about
dawn
don
carlos
heavy
breathing
ceased
he
fell
into
a
quiet
sleep
and
when
he
awoke
all
perceived
at
once
that
he
was
saved
he
did
not
recover
his
sight
seemingly
on
account
of
the
erysipelas
for
a
week
more
he
then
opened
his
eyes
upon
the
miraculous
image
of
atocha
and
vowed
that
if
he
recovered
he
would
give
to
the
virgin
at
four
different
shrines
in
spain
gold
plate
of
four
times
his
weight
and
silver
plate
of
seven
times
his
weight
when
he
should
rise
from
his
couch
so
on
the
of
june
he
rose
and
was
weighed
in
a
fur
coat
and
a
robe
of
damask
and
his
weight
was
three
arrobas
and
one
pound
six
pounds
in
all
on
the
of
june
he
went
to
visit
his
father
at
the
episcopal
palace
then
to
all
the
churches
and
shrines
in
alcala
and
of
course
to
that
of
fray
diego
whose
body
it
is
said
he
contemplated
for
some
time
with
edifying
devotion
the
next
year
saw
fray
diego
canonised
as
a
saint
at
the
intercession
of
philip
and
his
son
and
thus
don
carlos
the
world
to
be
a
terror
and
a
torment
to
all
around
him
and
to
die
not
by
philip
cruelty
as
his
enemies
reported
too
hastily
indeed
yet
excusably
for
they
knew
him
to
be
capable
of
any
wickedness
but
simply
of
constitutional
insanity
and
now
let
us
go
back
to
the
history
of
that
most
learned
famous
and
rare
baron
vesalius
who
had
stood
by
and
seen
all
these
things
done
and
try
if
we
can
not
after
we
have
learned
the
history
of
his
early
life
guess
at
some
of
his
probable
meditations
on
this
celebrated
clinical
case
and
guess
also
how
those
meditations
may
have
affected
seriously
the
events
of
his
after
life
vesalius
as
i
said
was
a
netherlander
born
at
brussels
in
or
his
father
and
grandfather
had
been
medical
men
of
the
highest
standing
in
a
profession
which
then
as
now
was
commonly
hereditary
his
real
name
was
wittag
an
ancient
family
of
wesel
on
the
rhine
from
which
town
either
he
or
his
father
adopted
the
name
of
vesalius
according
to
the
classicising
fashion
of
those
days
young
vesalius
was
sent
to
college
at
louvain
where
he
learned
rapidly
at
sixteen
or
seventeen
he
knew
not
only
latin
but
greek
enough
to
correct
the
proofs
of
galen
and
arabic
enough
to
become
acquainted
with
the
works
of
the
mussulman
physicians
he
was
a
physicist
too
and
a
mathematician
according
to
the
knowledge
of
those
times
but
his
passion
the
study
to
which
he
was
destined
to
devote
his
life
was
anatomy
little
or
nothing
it
must
be
understood
had
been
done
in
anatomy
since
the
days
of
galen
of
pergamos
in
the
second
century
after
christ
and
very
little
even
by
him
dissection
was
all
but
forbidden
among
the
ancients
the
egyptians
herodotus
tells
us
used
to
pursue
with
stones
and
curses
the
embalmers
as
soon
as
they
had
performed
their
unpleasant
office
and
though
herophilus
and
erasistratus
are
said
to
have
dissected
many
subjects
under
the
protection
of
ptolemy
soter
in
alexandria
itself
yet
the
public
feeling
of
the
greeks
as
well
as
of
the
romans
continued
the
same
as
that
of
the
ancient
egyptians
and
galen
was
fain
as
vesalius
proved
to
supplement
his
ignorance
of
the
human
frame
by
describing
that
of
an
ape
dissection
was
equally
forbidden
among
the
mussulmans
and
the
great
arabic
physicians
could
do
no
more
than
comment
on
galen
the
same
prejudice
extended
through
the
middle
age
medical
men
were
all
clerks
clerici
and
as
such
forbidden
to
shed
blood
the
only
dissection
as
far
as
i
am
aware
made
during
the
middle
age
was
one
by
mundinus
in
and
his
subsequent
commentaries
on
galen
for
he
dare
allow
his
own
eyes
to
see
no
more
than
galen
had
seen
before
him
constituted
the
best
anatomical
manual
in
europe
till
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
then
in
italy
at
least
the
classic
renaissance
gave
fresh
life
to
anatomy
as
to
all
other
sciences
especially
did
the
improvements
in
painting
and
sculpture
stir
men
up
to
a
closer
study
of
the
human
frame
leonardo
da
vinci
wrote
a
treatise
on
muscular
anatomy
the
artist
and
the
sculptor
often
worked
together
and
realised
that
sketch
of
michael
angelo
in
which
he
himself
is
assisting
fallopius
vesalius
famous
pupil
to
dissect
vesalius
soon
found
that
his
thirst
for
facts
could
not
be
slaked
by
the
theories
of
the
middle
age
so
in
he
went
off
to
montpellier
where
francis
had
just
founded
a
medical
school
and
where
the
ancient
laws
of
the
city
allowed
the
faculty
each
year
the
body
of
a
criminal
from
thence
after
becoming
the
and
the
friend
of
rondelet
and
probably
also
of
rabelais
and
those
other
luminaries
of
montpellier
of
whom
i
spoke
in
my
essay
on
rondelet
he
returned
to
paris
to
study
under
old
sylvius
whose
real
name
was
jacques
dubois
jock
o
the
wood
and
to
learn
less
as
he
complains
himself
in
an
anatomical
theatre
than
a
butcher
might
learn
in
his
shop
were
it
not
that
the
whole
question
of
dissection
is
one
over
which
it
is
right
to
draw
a
reverent
veil
as
a
thing
painful
however
necessary
and
however
innocent
it
would
be
easy
to
raise
ghastly
laughter
in
many
a
reader
by
the
stories
which
vesalius
himself
tells
of
his
struggles
to
learn
how
old
sylvius
tried
to
demonstrate
the
human
frame
from
a
bit
of
a
dog
fumbling
in
vain
for
muscles
which
he
could
not
find
or
which
ought
to
have
been
there
according
to
galen
and
were
not
while
young
vesalius
as
soon
as
the
old
pedant
back
was
turned
took
his
place
and
to
the
delight
of
the
students
found
for
him
provided
it
were
there
what
he
could
not
find
himself
how
he
went
and
often
at
the
danger
of
his
life
as
when
he
and
his
friend
were
nearly
torn
to
pieces
by
the
cannibal
dogs
who
haunted
the
butte
de
montfaucon
or
place
of
public
execution
how
he
acquired
by
a
long
and
dangerous
process
the
only
perfect
skeleton
then
in
the
world
and
the
hideous
story
of
the
robber
to
whom
it
had
belonged
all
these
horrors
those
who
list
may
read
for
themselves
elsewhere
i
hasten
past
them
with
this
remark
that
to
have
gone
through
the
toils
dangers
and
disgusts
which
vesalius
faced
argued
in
a
superstitious
and
cruel
age
like
his
no
common
physical
and
moral
courage
and
a
deep
conscience
that
he
was
doing
right
and
must
do
it
at
all
risks
in
the
face
of
a
generation
which
peculiarly
reckless
of
human
life
and
human
agony
allowed
that
frame
which
it
called
the
image
of
god
to
be
tortured
maimed
desecrated
in
every
way
while
alive
and
yet
straining
at
the
gnat
after
having
swallowed
the
camel
forbade
it
to
be
examined
when
dead
though
for
the
purpose
of
alleviating
the
miseries
of
mankind
the
breaking
out
of
war
between
francis
and
charles
drove
vesalius
back
to
his
native
country
and
louvain
and
in
we
hear
of
him
as
a
surgeon
in
charles
army
he
saw
most
probably
the
invasion
of
provence
and
the
disastrous
retreat
from
before
montmorency
fortified
camp
at
avignon
through
a
country
in
which
that
crafty
general
had
destroyed
every
article
of
human
food
except
the
ripe
grapes
he
saw
perhaps
the
spanish
soldiers
poisoned
alike
by
the
sour
fruit
and
by
the
blazing
sun
falling
in
hundreds
along
the
white
roads
which
led
back
into
savoy
murdered
by
the
peasantry
whose
homesteads
had
been
destroyed
stifled
by
the
weight
of
their
own
armour
or
desperately
putting
themselves
with
their
own
hands
out
of
a
world
which
had
become
intolerable
half
the
army
perished
two
thousand
corpses
lay
festering
between
aix
and
frejus
alone
if
young
vesalius
needed
subjects
the
ambition
and
the
crime
of
man
found
enough
for
him
in
those
blazing
september
days
he
went
to
italy
probably
with
the
remnants
of
the
army
where
could
he
have
rather
wished
to
find
himself
he
was
at
last
in
the
country
where
the
human
mind
seemed
to
be
growing
young
once
more
the
country
of
revived
arts
revived
sciences
learning
languages
and
though
alas
only
for
a
while
of
revived
free
thought
such
as
europe
had
not
seen
since
the
palmy
days
of
greece
here
at
least
he
would
be
appreciated
here
at
least
he
would
be
allowed
to
think
and
speak
and
he
was
appreciated
the
italian
cities
who
were
then
like
the
athenians
of
old
spending
their
time
in
nothing
else
save
to
hear
or
to
tell
something
new
welcomed
the
brave
young
fleming
and
his
novelties
within
two
years
he
was
professor
of
anatomy
at
padua
then
the
first
school
in
the
world
then
at
bologna
and
at
pisa
at
the
same
time
last
of
all
at
venice
where
titian
painted
that
portrait
of
him
which
remains
unto
this
day
these
years
were
for
him
a
continual
triumph
everywhere
as
he
demonstrated
on
the
human
body
students
crowded
his
theatre
or
hung
round
him
as
he
walked
the
streets
professors
left
their
own
chairs
their
scholars
having
deserted
them
already
to
go
and
listen
humbly
or
enviously
to
the
man
who
could
give
them
what
all
brave
souls
throughout
half
europe
were
craving
for
and
craving
in
vain
facts
and
so
year
after
year
was
realised
that
scene
which
stands
engraved
in
the
frontispiece
of
his
great
book
where
in
the
little
quaint
cinquecento
theatre
saucy
scholars
reverend
doctors
gay
gentlemen
and
even
cowled
monks
are
crowding
the
floor
peeping
over
each
other
shoulders
hanging
on
the
balustrades
while
in
the
centre
over
his
subject
which
one
of
those
same
cowled
monks
knew
but
too
well
stands
young
vesalius
upright
proud
almost
defiant
as
one
who
knows
himself
safe
in
the
impregnable
citadel
of
fact
and
in
his
hand
the
little
blade
of
steel
destined
because
wielded
in
obedience
to
the
laws
of
nature
which
are
the
laws
of
god
to
work
more
benefit
for
the
human
race
than
all
the
swords
which
were
drawn
in
those
days
or
perhaps
in
any
other
at
the
bidding
of
most
catholic
emperors
and
most
christian
kings
those
were
indeed
days
of
triumph
for
vesalius
of
triumph
deserved
because
earned
by
patient
and
accurate
toil
in
a
good
cause
but
vesalius
being
but
a
mortal
man
may
have
contracted
in
those
same
days
a
temper
of
imperiousness
and
such
as
he
showed
afterwards
when
his
pupil
fallopius
dared
to
add
fresh
discoveries
to
those
of
his
master
and
yet
in
spite
of
all
vesalius
knew
how
little
he
knew
how
humbling
to
his
pride
it
would
have
been
had
he
known
then
perhaps
he
does
know
now
that
he
had
actually
again
and
again
walked
as
it
were
round
and
round
the
true
theory
of
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
yet
never
seen
it
that
that
discovery
which
once
made
is
intelligible
as
far
as
any
phenomenon
is
intelligible
to
the
merest
peasant
was
reserved
for
another
century
and
for
one
of
those
englishmen
on
whom
vesalius
would
have
looked
as
to
make
a
long
story
short
three
years
after
the
publication
of
his
famous
book
corporis
humani
fabrica
he
left
venice
to
cure
charles
at
regensburg
and
became
one
of
the
great
emperor
physicians
this
was
the
crisis
of
vesalius
life
the
medicine
with
which
he
had
worked
the
cure
was
china
sarsaparilla
as
we
call
it
now
brought
home
from
the
then
banks
of
the
paraguay
and
uruguay
where
its
beds
of
tangled
vine
they
say
tinge
the
clear
waters
a
dark
brown
like
that
of
peat
and
convert
whole
streams
into
a
healthful
and
pleasant
tonic
on
the
virtues
of
this
china
then
supposed
to
be
a
root
vesalius
wrote
a
famous
little
book
into
which
he
contrived
to
interweave
his
opinions
on
things
in
general
as
good
bishop
berkeley
did
afterwards
into
his
essay
on
the
virtues
of
into
this
book
however
vesalius
introduced
as
bishop
berkeley
did
not
much
and
perhaps
too
much
about
himself
and
much
though
perhaps
not
too
much
about
poor
old
galen
and
his
substitution
of
an
ape
inside
for
that
of
a
human
being
the
storm
which
had
been
long
gathering
burst
upon
him
the
old
school
trembling
for
their
reign
bespattered
with
all
that
pedantry
ignorance
and
envy
could
suggest
the
man
who
dared
not
only
to
revolutionise
surgery
but
to
interfere
with
the
privileged
mysteries
of
medicine
and
over
and
above
to
become
a
favourite
at
the
court
of
the
greatest
of
monarchs
while
such
as
eustachius
himself
an
able
discoverer
could
join
in
the
cry
it
is
no
wonder
if
a
lower
soul
like
that
of
sylvius
led
it
he
was
a
mean
covetous
bad
man
as
george
buchanan
well
knew
and
according
to
his
nature
he
wrote
a
furious
book
vesani
calumnias
depulsandas
the
punning
change
of
vesalius
into
vesanus
madman
was
but
a
fair
and
gentle
stroke
for
a
polemic
in
days
in
which
those
who
could
not
kill
their
enemies
with
steel
or
powder
held
themselves
justified
in
doing
so
if
possible
by
vituperation
culumny
and
every
engine
of
moral
torture
but
a
far
more
terrible
weapon
and
one
which
made
vesalius
rage
and
it
may
be
for
once
in
his
life
tremble
was
the
charge
of
impiety
and
heresy
the
inquisition
was
a
very
ugly
place
it
was
very
easy
to
get
into
it
especially
for
a
netherlander
but
not
so
easy
to
get
out
indeed
vesalius
must
have
trembled
when
he
saw
his
master
charles
himself
take
fright
and
actually
call
on
the
theologians
of
salamanca
to
decide
whether
it
was
lawful
to
dissect
a
human
body
the
monks
to
their
honour
used
their
common
sense
and
answered
yes
the
deed
was
so
plainly
useful
that
it
must
be
lawful
likewise
but
vesalius
did
not
feel
that
he
had
triumphed
he
dreaded
possibly
lest
the
storm
should
only
have
blown
over
for
a
time
he
fell
possibly
into
hasty
disgust
at
the
folly
of
mankind
and
despair
of
arousing
them
to
use
their
common
sense
and
acknowledge
their
true
interest
and
their
true
benefactors
at
all
events
he
threw
into
the
fire
so
it
is
said
all
his
unpublished
manuscripts
the
records
of
long
years
of
observation
and
renounced
science
thenceforth
we
hear
of
him
after
this
at
brussels
and
at
basle
likewise
in
which
latter
city
in
the
company
of
physicians
naturalists
and
grecians
he
must
have
breathed
awhile
a
freer
air
but
he
seems
to
have
returned
thence
to
his
old
master
charles
and
to
have
finally
settled
at
madrid
as
a
court
surgeon
to
philip
who
sent
him
but
too
late
to
extract
the
lance
splinters
from
the
eye
of
the
dying
henry
ii
he
was
now
married
to
a
lady
of
rank
from
brussels
anne
van
hamme
by
name
and
their
daughter
married
in
time
philip
ii
grand
falconer
who
was
doubtless
a
personage
of
no
small
social
rank
he
was
well
off
in
worldly
things
somewhat
fond
it
is
said
of
good
living
and
of
luxury
inclined
it
may
be
to
say
let
us
eat
and
drink
for
we
die
and
to
sink
more
and
more
into
the
mere
worldling
unless
some
shock
awoke
him
from
his
lethargy
and
the
awakening
shock
did
come
after
eight
years
of
court
life
he
resolved
early
in
the
year
to
go
on
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
the
reasons
for
so
strange
a
determination
are
wrapped
in
mystery
and
contradiction
the
common
story
was
that
he
had
opened
a
corpse
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
death
and
that
to
the
horror
of
the
bystanders
the
heart
was
still
seen
to
beat
that
his
enemies
accused
him
to
the
inquisition
and
that
he
was
condemned
to
death
a
sentence
which
was
commuted
to
that
of
going
on
pilgrimage
but
here
at
the
very
outset
accounts
differ
one
says
that
the
victim
was
a
nobleman
name
not
given
another
that
it
was
a
lady
maid
name
not
given
it
is
most
improbable
if
not
impossible
that
vesalius
of
all
men
should
have
mistaken
a
living
body
for
a
dead
one
while
it
is
most
probable
on
the
other
hand
that
his
medical
enemies
would
gladly
raise
such
a
calumny
against
him
when
he
was
no
longer
in
spain
to
contradict
it
meanwhile
llorente
the
historian
of
the
inquisition
makes
no
mention
of
vesalius
having
been
brought
before
its
tribunal
while
he
does
mention
residence
at
madrid
another
story
is
that
he
went
abroad
to
escape
the
bad
temper
of
his
wife
another
that
he
wanted
to
enrich
himself
another
story
and
that
not
an
unlikely
one
is
that
he
was
jealous
of
the
rising
reputation
of
his
pupil
fallopius
then
professor
of
anatomy
at
venice
this
distinguished
surgeon
as
i
said
before
had
written
a
book
in
which
he
had
added
to
vesalius
discoveries
and
corrected
certain
errors
of
his
vesalius
had
answered
him
hastily
and
angrily
quoting
his
anatomy
from
memory
for
as
he
himself
complained
he
could
not
in
spain
obtain
a
subject
for
dissection
not
even
he
said
a
single
skull
he
had
sent
his
book
to
venice
to
be
published
and
had
heard
seemingly
nothing
of
it
he
may
have
felt
that
he
was
falling
behind
in
the
race
of
science
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
carry
on
his
studies
in
madrid
and
so
angry
with
his
own
laziness
and
luxury
he
may
have
felt
the
old
sacred
fire
flash
up
in
him
and
have
determined
to
go
to
italy
and
become
a
student
and
a
worker
once
more
the
very
day
that
he
set
out
clusius
of
arras
then
probably
the
best
botanist
in
the
world
arrived
at
madrid
and
asking
the
reason
of
vesalius
departure
was
told
by
their
charles
de
tisnacq
procurator
for
the
affairs
of
the
netherlands
that
vesalius
had
gone
of
his
own
free
will
and
with
all
facilities
which
philip
could
grant
him
in
performance
of
a
vow
which
he
had
made
during
a
dangerous
illness
here
at
least
we
have
a
drop
of
information
which
seems
taken
from
the
stream
sufficiently
near
to
the
but
it
must
be
recollected
that
de
tisnacq
lived
in
dangerous
times
and
may
have
found
it
necessary
to
walk
warily
in
them
that
through
him
had
been
sent
only
the
year
before
that
famous
letter
from
william
of
orange
horn
and
egmont
the
fate
whereof
may
be
read
in
motley
fourth
chapter
that
the
crisis
of
the
netherlands
which
sprung
out
of
that
letter
was
coming
fast
and
that
as
de
tisnacq
was
on
friendly
terms
with
egmont
he
may
have
felt
his
head
at
times
somewhat
loose
on
his
shoulders
especially
if
he
had
heard
alva
say
as
he
wrote
that
every
time
he
saw
the
despatches
of
those
three
senors
they
moved
his
choler
so
that
if
he
did
not
take
much
care
to
temper
it
he
would
seem
a
frenzied
man
in
such
times
de
tisnacq
may
have
thought
good
to
return
a
diplomatic
answer
to
a
concerning
a
third
especially
when
that
countryman
as
a
former
pupil
of
melancthon
at
wittemberg
might
himself
be
under
suspicion
of
heresy
and
therefore
of
possible
treason
be
this
as
it
may
one
can
not
but
suspect
some
strain
of
truth
in
the
story
about
the
inquisition
perhaps
in
that
also
of
his
unkindness
for
whether
or
not
vesalius
operated
on
don
carlos
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
that
miraculous
virgin
of
atocha
at
the
bed
foot
of
the
prince
he
had
heard
his
recovery
attributed
not
to
the
operation
but
to
the
intercession
of
fray
now
saint
diego
and
he
must
have
had
his
thoughts
thereon
and
may
in
an
unguarded
moment
have
spoken
them
for
he
was
be
it
always
remembered
a
netherlander
the
crisis
of
his
country
was
just
at
hand
rebellion
was
inevitable
and
with
rebellion
horrors
unutterable
and
meanwhile
don
carlos
had
set
his
mad
brain
on
having
the
command
of
the
netherlands
in
his
rage
at
not
having
it
as
all
the
world
knows
he
nearly
killed
alva
with
his
own
hands
some
two
years
after
if
it
be
true
that
don
carlos
felt
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
vesalius
he
may
after
his
wont
have
poured
out
to
him
some
wild
confidence
about
the
netherlands
to
have
even
heard
which
would
be
a
crime
in
philip
eyes
and
if
this
be
but
a
fancy
still
vesalius
was
as
i
just
said
a
netherlander
and
one
of
a
brain
and
a
spirit
to
which
philip
doings
and
the
air
of
the
spanish
court
must
have
been
growing
even
more
and
more
intolerable
hundreds
of
his
country
folk
perhaps
men
and
women
whom
he
had
known
were
being
racked
burnt
alive
buried
alive
at
the
bidding
of
a
jocular
ruffian
peter
titelmann
the
chief
inquisitor
the
day
of
the
and
the
wholesale
massacre
which
followed
it
had
happened
but
two
years
before
and
by
all
the
signs
of
the
times
these
murders
and
miseries
were
certain
to
increase
and
why
were
all
these
poor
wretches
suffering
the
extremity
of
horror
but
because
they
would
not
believe
in
miraculous
images
and
bones
of
dead
friars
and
the
rest
of
that
science
of
unreason
and
unfact
against
which
vesalius
had
been
fighting
all
his
life
consciously
or
not
by
using
reason
and
observing
fact
what
wonder
if
in
some
burst
of
noble
indignation
and
just
contempt
he
forgot
a
moment
that
he
had
sold
his
soul
and
his
love
of
science
likewise
to
be
a
luxurious
yet
uneasy
at
the
tyrant
court
and
spoke
unadvisedly
some
word
worthy
of
a
german
man
as
to
the
story
of
his
unhappy
quarrels
with
his
wife
there
may
be
a
grain
of
truth
in
it
likewise
vesalius
religion
must
have
sat
very
lightly
on
him
the
man
who
had
robbed
churchyards
and
gibbets
from
his
youth
was
not
likely
to
be
much
afraid
of
apparitions
and
demons
he
had
handled
too
many
human
bones
to
care
much
for
those
of
saints
he
was
probably
like
his
friends
of
basle
montpellier
and
paris
somewhat
of
a
heretic
at
heart
probably
somewhat
of
a
pagan
his
lady
anne
van
hamme
was
probably
a
strict
catholic
as
her
father
being
a
councillor
and
master
of
the
exchequer
at
brussels
was
bound
to
be
and
freethinking
in
the
husband
crossed
by
superstition
in
the
wife
may
have
caused
in
them
that
wretched
vie
a
part
that
want
of
any
true
communion
of
soul
too
common
to
this
day
in
catholic
countries
be
these
things
as
they
may
and
the
exact
truth
of
them
will
now
be
never
known
vesalius
set
out
to
jerusalem
in
the
spring
of
on
his
way
he
visited
his
old
friends
at
venice
to
see
about
his
book
against
fallopius
the
venetian
republic
received
the
great
philosopher
with
open
arms
fallopius
was
just
dead
and
the
senate
offered
their
guest
the
vacant
chair
of
anatomy
he
accepted
it
but
went
on
to
the
east
he
never
occupied
that
chair
wrecked
upon
the
isle
of
zante
as
he
was
sailing
back
from
palestine
he
died
miserably
of
fever
and
want
as
thousands
of
pilgrims
returning
from
the
holy
land
had
died
before
him
a
goldsmith
recognised
him
buried
him
in
a
chapel
of
the
virgin
and
put
up
over
him
a
simple
stone
which
remained
till
late
years
and
may
remain
for
aught
i
know
even
now
so
perished
in
the
prime
of
life
a
martyr
to
his
love
of
science
to
quote
the
words
of
burggraeve

able
biographer
and
commentator
the
prodigious
man
who
created
a
science
at
an
epoch
when
everything
was
still
an
obstacle

the

will
be
shared
by
all
who
have
read
professor

biographies
of
jerome
cardan

of
cornelius
agrippa
that
he
will
find
leisure
to
return
to
the
study
of
vesalius

and
will
do
for
him
what
he
has
done

account

carlos
illness

of
the
miraculous
agencies
by
which
his

to
have
been
effected
the
general
reader
should
consult
miss

elizabeth

in
justice
to
poor
doctor
olivarez
it
must
be
said
that
while
he
allows
all
force
to
the
intercession
of
the
virgin
and
of
fray
diego
and
of
many
just
persons
he
can
not
allow
that
there
was
any
miracle
properly
so
called
because
the
prince
was
cured
according
to
natural
order
and
by
experimented
remedies

the
physicians
