my
dear
madam
in
beginning
this
subject
of
the
study
of
child
life
there
may
be
lurking
doubts
in
your
mind
as
to
whether
any
reliable
rules
can
really
be
laid
down
they
seem
to
arise
mostly
from
the
perception
of
the
great
difference
between
children
what
will
do
for
one
child
will
not
do
for
another
some
children
are
easily
persuaded
and
gentle
others
willful
still
others
sullen
unresponsive
how
then
is
it
possible
that
a
system
of
education
and
training
can
be
devised
suitable
for
their
various
dispositions
we
must
remember
that
children
are
much
more
alike
than
they
are
different
one
may
have
blue
eyes
another
gray
another
black
but
they
all
have
two
we
are
therefore
in
a
position
to
make
rules
for
creatures
having
two
eyes
and
these
rules
apply
to
eyes
of
all
colors
children
may
be
nervous
sanguine
bilious
or
plethoric
but
they
all
have
the
same
kind
of
internal
organs
end
the
same
general
rules
of
health
apply
to
them
all
in
this
series
of
lessons
i
have
endeavored
to
set
forth
principles
briefly
and
to
confirm
them
by
instances
within
the
experience
of
every
observer
of
childhood
the
rules
given
are
such
as
are
held
at
present
by
the
best
educators
to
be
based
upon
sound
philosophy
not
at
variance
with
the
slight
array
or
scientific
facts
at
our
command
perhaps
you
yourself
may
be
able
to
add
to
the
number
of
reliable
facts
intelligently
reported
that
must
be
collected
before
much
greater
scientific
advance
is
possible
there
is
to
be
sure
an
art
of
application
of
these
rules
both
in
matters
of
health
of
body
and
of
health
of
mind
and
this
art
must
be
worked
out
by
each
mother
for
each
individual
child
we
all
recognize
that
it
is
a
long
endeavor
before
we
can
apply
to
our
own
lives
such
principles
of
conduct
as
we
heartily
acknowledge
to
be
right
why
then
expect
to
be
able
to
apply
principles
instantly
and
unerringly
to
a
little
child
if
a
rule
fails
when
you
attempt
to
apply
it
before
questioning
the
principle
may
it
not
be
well
to
question
your
own
tact
and
skill
so
far
as
i
can
advise
with
you
in
special
instances
of
difficulty
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
so
not
that
i
shall
always
know
what
to
do
myself
but
that
we
can
get
a
little
more
light
upon
the
problems
by
conferring
together
i
know
well
how
difficult
a
matter
this
of
child
training
is
for
every
day
in
the
management
of
my
own
family
of
children
i
find
each
philosophy
science
and
art
as
i
can
command
very
much
put
to
the
test
sincerely
yours

life
part
i
the
young
of
the
human
species
is
less
able
to
care
for
itself
than
the
young
of
any
other
species
most
other
creatures
are
able
to
walk
or
at
any
rate
stand
within
a
few
hours
of
birth
but
the
human
baby
is
absolutely
dependent
and
helpless
unable
even
to
manufacture
all
the
animal
heat
that
he
requires
the
study
of
his
condition
at
birth
at
once
suggests
a
number
of
practical
procedures
some
of
them
quite
at
variance
with
the
traditional
procedures
how
the
child
develops
sidenote
condition
at
birth
let
us
see
then
exactly
what
his
condition
is
in
the
first
place
he
is
as
virchow
an
authority
on
physiological
subjects
declares
merely
a
spinal
animal
some
of
the
higher
brain
centers
do
not
yet
exist
at
all
while
others
are
in
too
incomplete
a
state
for
service
the
various
sensations
which
the
baby
experiences
heat
light
contact
motion
are
so
many
stimuli
to
the
development
of
these
centers
if
the
stimulus
is
too
great
the
development
is
sometimes
unduly
hastened
with
serious
results
which
show
themselves
chiefly
in
later
life
the
child
who
is
brought
up
a
noisy
room
is
constantly
talked
to
and
fondled
is
likely
to
develop
prematurely
to
talk
and
walk
at
an
early
age
also
to
fall
into
nervous
decay
at
an
early
age
and
even
if
by
reason
of
an
unusually
good
heredity
he
escapes
these
dangers
it
is
almost
certain
that
his
intellectual
power
is
not
so
great
in
adult
life
as
it
would
have
been
under
more
favorable
conditions
a
new
baby
like
a
young
plant
requires
darkness
and
quiet
for
the
most
part
as
he
grows
older
and
shows
a
spontaneous
interest
in
his
surroundings
he
may
fittingly
have
more
light
more
companionship
and
experience
more
sensations
sidenote
weight
at
birth
the
average
boy
baby
weighs
about
seven
pounds
at
birth
the
average
girl
about
six
and
a
half
pounds
the
head
is
larger
in
proportion
to
the
body
than
in
after
life
the
nose
is
incomplete
the
legs
short
and
bowed
with
a
tendency
to
fall
back
upon
the
body
with
the
knees
flexed
this
natural
tendency
should
be
allowed
full
play
for
the
flexed
position
is
said
to
be
favorable
to
the
growth
of
the
bones
permitting
the
cartilaginous
ends
of
the
bones
to
lie
free
from
pressure
at
the
joints
the
plates
of
the
skull
are
not
complete
and
do
not
fit
together
at
the
edges
great
care
needs
to
be
taken
of
the
soft
spot
thus
left
exposed
on
the
top
of
the
head
the
undeveloped
place
where
the
edges
of
these
bones
come
together
any
injury
here
in
early
life
is
liable
to
affect
the
mind
sidenote
state
of
development
the
bony
enclosures
of
the
middle
ear
are
unfinished
and
the
eyes
also
are
unfinished
it
is
a
question
yet
to
be
settled
whether
a
baby
is
blind
and
deaf
or
not
at
a
rate
he
soon
acquires
a
sensitiveness
to
both
light
and
sound
although
it
is
three
years
or
more
before
he
has
amassed
sufficient
experience
to
estimate
with
accuracy
the
distance
of
objects
seen
or
herd
he
can
cry
suck
sneeze
cough
kick
and
hold
on
to
a
finger
all
of
these
acts
though
they
do
not
yet
imply
personality
or
even
mind
give
evidence
of
a
wonderful
organism
they
require
the
of
many
delicate
nerves
and
muscles
a
that
has
as
yet
baffled
the
power
of
scientists
to
explain
although
the
young
baby
is
in
almost
constant
motion
while
he
is
awake
he
is
altogether
too
weak
to
turn
himself
in
bed
or
to
escape
from
an
uncomfortable
position
and
he
remains
so
for
many
weeks
this
constant
motion
is
necessary
to
his
muscular
development
his
control
of
his
own
muscles
his
circulation
and
very
probably
to
the
free
transmission
of
nervous
energy
therefore
it
is
of
the
first
importance
that
he
has
freedom
to
move
and
he
should
be
given
time
every
day
to
move
and
stretch
before
the
fire
without
clothes
on
it
is
well
to
rub
his
back
and
legs
at
the
same
time
thus
supplementing
his
gymnastics
with
a
gentle
massage
sidenote
educational
beginnings
by
the
time
he
is
four
or
five
weeks
old
it
is
safe
to
play
with
him
a
little
every
day
and
froebel
has
made
his
play
with
the
limbs
one
of
his
first
educational
exercises
in
this
play
the
mother
lays
the
baby
undressed
upon
a
pillow
and
catches
the
little
ankles
in
her
hands
sometimes
she
prevents
the
baby
from
kicking
so
that
he
has
to
struggle
to
get
his
legs
free
sometimes
she
helps
him
so
that
he
kicks
more
freely
and
regularly
sometimes
she
lets
him
push
hard
against
her
breast
all
the
time
she
laughs
and
sings
to
him
and
froebel
has
made
a
little
song
for
this
purposes
since
consciousness
is
roused
and
deepened
by
sensations
remembered
experienced
and
compared
it
is
evident
that
this
is
more
than
a
fanciful
play
that
it
is
what
froebel
claimed
for
it
a
real
educational
exercise
by
means
of
it
the
child
may
gain
some
consciousness
of
companionship
and
thus
by
contrast
a
deeper
sidenote
first
efforts
the
baby
is
at
first
unable
to
hold
up
its
head
and
in
this
he
is
just
like
all
other
animals
for
no
animal
except
man
holds
up
its
head
constantly
the
human
baby
apparently
makes
the
effort
because
he
desires
to
see
more
clearly
he
could
doubtless
see
clearly
enough
for
all
physical
purposes
with
his
head
hung
down
but
not
enough
to
satisfy
his
awakening
mentality
the
effort
to
hold
the
head
up
and
to
look
around
is
therefore
regarded
by
most
psychologists
as
one
of
the
first
tokens
of
an
awakening
intellectual
life
and
this
is
true
although
the
first
effort
seems
to
arise
from
an
overplus
of
nervous
energy
which
makes
the
neck
muscles
contract
just
as
it
makes
other
muscles
contract
the
first
slight
raisings
of
the
head
are
like
the
first
kicking
movements
merely
impulsive
but
the
child
soon
sees
the
advantage
of
this
apparently
accidental
movement
and
tries
to
master
it
preyer
a
considers
that
the
efforts
to
balance
the
head
among
the
first
indications
that
the
child
will
is
taking
possession
of
his
muscles
his
own
boy
arrived
at
this
point
when
he
was
between
three
and
four
months
old
sidenote
reflex
grasping
the
grasp
of
the
baby
hand
has
a
surprising
power
but
the
baby
himself
has
little
to
do
with
it
the
muscles
act
because
of
a
stimulus
presented
by
the
touch
of
the
fingers
very
much
as
the
muscles
of
a
decapitated
frog
contract
when
the
current
of
electricity
passes
over
them
this
is
called
reflex
grasping
and
louis
robinson
b
thinking
that
this
early
strength
of
gasp
was
an
important
illustration
of
and
evidence
for
evolution
tried
experiments
on
some
sixty
babies
he
found
that
they
could
sustain
their
whole
weight
by
the
arms
alone
when
their
hands
were
clasped
about
a
slender
rod
they
grasped
the
rod
at
once
and
could
be
lifted
from
the
bed
by
it
and
kept
in
this
position
about
half
a
minute
he
argued
that
this
early
strength
of
arm
which
soon
begins
to
disappear
was
survival
from
the
remote
period
when
the
ancestors
were
monkeys
or
people
who
lived
in
trees
sidenote
beginnings
of
will
power
however
this
may
be
during
the
first
week
the
baby
hands
are
much
about
his
face
by
accident
they
reach
the
mouth
they
are
sucked
the
child
feels
himself
suck
its
own
fist
he
feels
his
fist
being
sucked
some
day
it
will
occur
to
him
that
that
fist
belongs
to
the
same
being
who
owns
the
sucking
mouth
but
at
this
point
miss
shinn
c
has
observed
the
baby
is
often
surprised
and
indignant
that
he
can
not
move
his
arms
around
and
at
the
same
time
suck
his
fist
this
discomfort
helps
him
to
make
an
effort
to
get
his
fist
into
his
mouth
and
keep
it
there
and
this
effort
shows
his
will
beginning
to
take
possession
of
his
hands
and
arms
sidenote
growth
of
will
since
any
faculty
grows
by
its
own
exercise
just
as
muscles
grow
by
exercise
every
time
the
baby
succeeds
in
getting
his
hands
to
his
mouth
as
a
result
of
desire
every
time
that
he
succeeds
in
grasping
an
object
as
result
of
desire
his
will
power
grows
action
of
this
nature
brings
in
new
sensations
and
the
brain
centers
used
for
recording
such
sensations
grow
as
the
sensations
multiply
he
compares
them
and
an
idea
is
born
for
the
beginnings
of
mental
development
no
other
mechanism
is
actually
needed
than
a
brain
and
a
hand
and
the
nerves
connecting
them

intentional

the

baby
does
not

to
grasp
objects
with
intention
before
the
fourth
month
the
first
grasping
seems
to
be
done
by
feeling
without
the

of
the
eye
and
is
done
with
the
fingers
with
no

oppose
the
thumb
to
them

the

of
the
thumbs
set
opposite

coincide
with
the
first
grasping

the

of

that
some
observers
have
been
led
to
believe
that
as
soon
as
the

learns
to
use
its

in
this
way
he
proves
that
he
is

discovered
ages

that
his
boy
looked
at

own

seemed
to
study
them
until
his
eyes
crossed
about
the

the

notices

uses
his

three

easily
taught
to
let
the
piece
that
have
found
their
way
into
his

be
taken
out
again
now
too
he
begins
to
throw
things

he
wants
to
get
them
back
again
and
the
patient
mother
must
pick
them
up

back
many
times
sometimes
a
baby
is
punished
for
this
proclivity
but
it
is
really
a
part
of
his
development
and
at
least
once
a
day
he
should
be
allowed
to
play
in
this
manner
to
his
heart

it
is
tact
not
discipline
that
is
needed
and
the
more
he
is

the
right
sort
is
to
a
young
child
the
less

need

be
given

it
is
poor
economy
to
neglect
a
young
child
and
try
to
make
it
up
on
the
growing
boy
or

this
is
to
substitute
a
complicated
and

for
a
simple
one

the

is
some
time

he
can

off

that
invites
him
the
many
battles
between
mothers
and
children
it
the
subject
of
not
touching
forbidden
things
are
at
this
stage
a
genuine
wrong
and
injustice
to
the
child
so
young
a
child
is
scarcely
more
responsible
for
touching
whatever
he
can
reach
that
is
a
piece
of
steel
for
being
drawn
toward
a
powerful
magnet
preyer

that
it
is
years
before
voluntary
inhibitions
of
grasping
become
possible
the

has
not
the

commands
and
sparring
of
the
hands
create
bewilderment
and
tend
to
build
up
a
barrier
between

instead
of
doing
such
thing
simply
put
high
out
of

whatever
the
child
must
not
touch
another
way
in
which
young
children
are
often
made
to
suffer
because
of
the
ignorance
of
parents
is
the
leaving
of
undesired
food
on
the
child
plate
every
child
when
he
does
not
want
his
food
pushes
the
plate
away
from
him
and
many
mothers
push
it
back
and
scold
the
real
truth
is
that
the
motor
suggestion
of
the
food
upon
the
plate
is
so
strong
that
the
child
feels
as
if
he
were
being
forced
to
eat
it
every
time
he
looks
at
the
plate
to
escape
from
eating
it
he
is
obliged
to
push
it
out
of
sight
sidenote
the
three
months
baby
but
this
difficulty
comes
later
now
we
are
concerned
with
a
baby
at
this
stage
the
child
is
usually
able
to
balance
his
head
to
sit
up
against
pillows
to
seize
and
grasp
objects
and
to
hold
out
his
arm
when
he
wishes
to
be
taken
although
he
may
have
made
number
of
efforts
to
sit
erect
and
may
have
succeeded
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
he
still
is
far
from
being
able
to
sit
alone
unsupported
this
he
does
not
accomplish
until
the
fifth
or
the
month
sidenote
danger
of
forcing
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
trying
to
make
him
sit
alone
sooner
indeed
there
is
danger
in
it
danger
in
forcing
young
bones
and
muscles
to
do
work
beyond
their
strength
and
danger
also
to
the
nerves
it
is
safe
to
say
that
normal
child
always
exercises
all
its
faculties
to
the
utmost
without
need
of
urging
and
any
exercise
beyond
the
point
of
natural
fatigue
if
persisted
in
is
sure
to
bring
about
abnormal
sidenote
creeping
the
first
efforts
toward
creeping
often
appear
in
the
bath
when
the
child
turns
over
and
raise
himself
upon
his
hands
and
knees
this
is
sign
that
he
might
creep
sooner
if
he
were
not
impeded
by
clothing
he
should
be
allowed
to
spread
himself
upon
a
blanket
every
day
for
an
hour
or
two
and
to
get
on
his
knees
as
frequently
as
he
pleases
often
he
needs
a
little
help
to
make
him
creep
forward
for
most
babies
creep
backward
at
first
their
arms
being
stronger
than
their
legs
here
the
mother
may
safely
interfere
pushing
the
legs
as
they
ought
to
go
and
showing
the
child
how
to
manage
himself
for
very
often
he
becomes
much
excited
over
his
inability
to
creep
forward
the
climbing
instinct
begins
to
appear
by
this
time
the
seventh
month
and
here
the
has
its
great
advantages
it
ought
not
to
be
shut
from
him
by
a
gate
but
he
should
be
taught
how
to
climb
up
and
down
it
in
safety
to
do
this
start
him
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
you
yourself
being
below
him
draw
first
one
knee
and
then
the
other
over
the
step
thus
showing
him
how
to
creep
backward
two
lessons
of
about
twenty
minutes
each
will
be
sufficient
the
only
danger
is
creeping
down
head
foremost
but
if
he
once
learns
thoroughly
to
go
backward
and
has
not
been
allowed
the
other
way
at
all
he
will
never
dream
of
trying
it
in
going
down
backward
if
he
should
slip
he
can
easily
save
himself
by
catching
the
stairs
with
his
hands
as
he
slips
past
the
child
who
creeps
is
often
later
in
his
attempts
to
walk
than
the
child
who
does
not
and
therefore
when
he
is
ready
to
walk
his
legs
will
be
all
the
stronger
and
the
danger
of
will
be
past
as
long
as
the
child
remains
satisfied
with
creeping
he
is
not
yet
ready
either
mentally
or
physically
for
walking
sidenote
standing
if
the
child
has
been
allowed
to
creep
about
freely
he
will
soon
be
standing
he
will
pull
himself
to
his
feet
by
means
of
any
chair
table
or
indeed
anything
that
he
may
get
hold
of
to
avoid
injuring
him
no
flimsy
chairs
or
tables
should
be
allowed
in
his
nursery
he
will
next
begin
to
sidle
around
a
chair
shuffling
his
feet
in
a
vague
fashion
and
sometimes
needing
both
of
his
hands
to
seize
some
coveted
object
he
will
stand
without
clinging
leaning
on
his
stomach

unhurried
child
may
remain
at
this
stage
for
weeks
sidenote
walking
let
alone
as
he
should
be
he
will
walk
without
knowing
how
he
does
it
and
will
be
the
stronger
for
having
overcome
his
difficulties
himself
he
should
not
be
coaxed
to
stand
or
walk
the
things
in
his
room
actually
urge
him
to
come
and
get
them
any
further
persuasion
is
forced
and
may
urge
him
beyond
his
strength
and
are
injurious
in
this
respect
they
keep
the
child
from
his
native
freedom
of
sprawling
climbing
and
pulling
himself
up
the
activity
they
do
permit
is
less
varied
and
helpful
than
the
normal
activity
and
the
child
restricted
from
the
preparatory
motions
begins
to
walk
too
soon
sidenote
alternate
growth
a
curious
fact
in
the
growth
of
children
is
that
they
seem
to
grow
heavier
for
a
certain
period
and
then
to
grow
taller
for
a
similar
period
that
is
a
very
young
baby
say
two
months
old
will
grow
fatter
for
about
six
weeks
and
then
for
the
next
six
weeks
will
grow
longer
while
the
child
of
six
years
changes
his
manner
of
growth
every
three
or
four
months
these
periods
are
variable
or
at
least
their
law
has
not
yet
been
established
but
the
observant
mother
can
soon
make
the
period
out
for
herself
in
the
case
of
her
own
child
for
two
or
three
days
when
the
manner
of
growth
seems
to
be
changing
from
breadth
to
length
and
vice
versa
the
children
are
likely
to
be
unusually
nervous
and
irritable
and
these
aberrations
must
of
course
be
patiently
borne
with
sidenote
precocity
sidenote
early
ripening
in
all
these
things
some
children
develop
earlier
than
others
but
too
early
development
is
to
be
regretted
precocious
children
are
always
of
a
delicate
nervous
organization
fiske
d
has
proved
to
us
that
the
reason
why
the
human
young
is
so
far
more
helpless
and
dependent
than
the
young
of
any
other
species
is
because
the
activities
of
the
human
race
have
become
so
many
so
widely
varied
and
so
complex
that
they
could
not
fix
themselves
in
the
nervous
structure
before
birth
there
a
only
a
few
things
that
the
chick
needs
to
know
in
order
to
lead
a
successful
chicken
life
as
a
consequence
these
few
things
are
well
impressed
upon
the
small
brain
before
ever
he
chips
the
shell
but
the
baby
needs
to
learn
a
great
many
things
so
many
that
there
is
no
time
or
room
to
implant
them
before
birth
or
indeed
in
the
few
years
immediately
succeeding
birth
to
hurry
the
development
therefore
of
certain
few
of
these
faculties
like
the
faculties
of
talking
and
walking
of
imitation
or
response
is
to
crowd
out
many
other
faculties
perhaps
just
beginning
to
grow
such
forcing
will
limit
the
child
future
development
to
the
few
faculties
whose
growth
is
thus
early
stimulated
precocity
in
a
child
therefore
is
a
thing
to
be
deplored
his
early
ripening
foretells
a
early
decay
and
a
wise
mother
is
she
who
gives
her
child
ample
opportunity
for
growing

no
urging

the
gertrude
suit
the
practice
of
putting
extra
wrappings
about
the
abdomen
is
responsible
for
undue
tenderness
of
those
organs
grosvenor
of
chicago
who
designed
a
model
costume
for
a
baby
which
he
called
the
gertrude
suit
says
that
many
cases
of
rupture
are
due
to
bandaging
of
the
abdomen
when
the
child
cries
the
abdominal
walls
normally
expand
if
they
are
tightly
bound
they
can
not
do
this
and
the
pressure
upon
one
single
part
which
the
bandages
may
not
hold
quite
firmly
becomes
overwhelming
and
results
in
rupture
grosvenor
also
thinks
that
many
cases
of
weak
lungs
and
even
of
consumption
in
later
life
are
due
to
the
tight
bands
of
the
skirts
pressing
upon
the
soft
ribs
of
the
young
child
and
narrowing
the
lung
space
sidenote
objection
to
the
pinning
blanket
from
not
only
should
the
clothes
not
bind
the
child
body
in
any
way
but
they
should
not
be
so
long
as
to
prevent
free
exercise
of
the
legs
the
is
objectionable
on
this
account
it
is
difficult
for
the
child
to
kick
in
it
and
as
we
have
seen
before
kicking
is
necessary
to
the
proper
development
of
the
legs
undue
length
of
skirt
operates
in
the
same
way
the
weight
of
cloth
is
a
check
upon
activity
the
first
garment
of
a
young
baby
should
not
be
more
than
a
yard
in
length
from
the
neck
to
the
bottom
of
the
hem
and
of
a
yard
is
enough
for
the
inner
garment
the
sleeves
too
should
be
large
and
loose
and
the
should
be
roomy
so
as
to
prevent
chafing
the
sleeves
may
be
tied
in
at
the
wrist
with
a
ribbon
to
insure
warmth
of
the
underclothing
should
be
made
of
pure
wool
so
as
to
gain
the
greatest
amount
of
warmth
from
the
least
weight
in
the
few
cases
where
wool
would
cause
irritation
a
silk
and
wool
fixture
makes
a
softer
but
more
expensive
garment
under
the
best
conditions
clothes
restrict
and
impede
free
development
somewhat
and
the
heavier
they
are
the
more
they
impede
it
therefore
the
effort
should
be
to
get
the
greatest
amount
of
warmth
with
the
least
possible
weight
knit
garments
attain
this
most
perfectly
but
the
next
best
thing
is
flannel
of
a
fine
grade
the
weave
known
as
stockinet
is
best
of
all
because
goods
thus
made
cling
to
the

restrict

on

of
the

the

should
have

these
tucks

are
better
run
in

so
that
they
may
be
easily

grows

the

which

made
in
the

only
an

larger
in

it
is
made
of

be

dressed
in

the
child
is
evenly
covered
with
too
thicknesses
of
flannel
and
one
of
cotton
as
the
skirts
are
rather
short
however
and
he
is
expected
to
move
his
legs
about
freely
he
may
well
wear
long
white
wool
stockings
as
the
child
grows
older
the
principles
underlying
this
method
of
clothing
should
be
borne
in
mind
and
clothes
should
be
designed
and
adapted
so
as
to
meet
these
three
requirements
food
sidenote
natural
food
sidenote
babies
the
natural
food
of
a
young
baby
is
his
mother
milk
and
no
satisfactory
substitute
for
it
has
yet
been
found
some
manufactured
baby
foods
do
well
for
certain
children
to
others
they
are
almost
poison
and
for
none
of
them
are
they
sufficient
the
milk
of
the
cow
is
not
designed
for
the
human
infant
it
contains
too
much
casein
and
is
too
difficult
of
digestion
various
preparations
of
milk
and
grains
are
recommended
by
nurses
and
physicians
but
no
conscientious
nurse
or
physician
pretends
that
any
of
them
begins
to
equal
the
nutritive
value
of
human
milk
more
women
can
nurse
their
babies
than
now
think
they
can
the
advertisements
of
patent
foods
lead
them
to
think
the
rather
of
little
importance
and
they
do
not
make
the
necessary
effort
to
preserve
and
increase
the
natural
supply
of
milk
the
family
physician
can
almost
always
better
the
condition
of
the
mother
who
really
desires
to
nurse
her
own
child
and
he
should
be
consulted
and
his
directions
obeyed
the
importance
of
a
really
great
effort
to
this
direction
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
physical
culture
records
now
so
carefully
kept
in
many
of
our
schools
and
colleges
prove
that
babies
are
more
likely
to
be
of
small
stature
and
to
have
deficient
bones
teeth
and
hair
than
children
who
have
been
fed
on
mother
milk
sidenote
simple
diet
the
food
question
is
undoubtedly
the
most
important
problem
to
the
physical
welfare
of
the
child
and
has
as
well
a
most
profound
effect
upon
his
disposition
and
character
indiscriminate
feeding
is
the
cause
of
much
of
the
trouble
and
worry
of
mothers
this
subject
is
taken
up
at
length
in
other
papers
of
this
course
and
it
will
suffice
to
say
here
that
the
table
of
the
family
with
young
children
should
be
regulated
largely
by
the
needs
of
the
growing
sons
and
daughters
the
simplified
diet
necessary
may
well
be
of
benefit
to
other
members
of
the
family
faults
and
their
remedies
the
child
born
of
perfect
parents
brought
up
perfectly
in
a
perfect
environment
would
probably
have
no
faults
even
such
a
child
however
would
be
at
times
inconvenient
and
would
do
and
say
things
at
variance
with
the
order
of
the
adult
world
therefore
he
might
seem
to
a
hasty
prejudiced
observer
to
be
naughty
and
indeed
imperfectly
born
imperfectly
trained
as
children
now
are
many
of
their
faults
are
no
more
than
such
inconvenient

an

with

no

on

to

in
his

though
he
may
object
to

in

and
he
can
not
understand
why
an

should
set
so
much

on
the
quiet
listening
which
is
so
infrequent
in

whatever
to

none
of
these

imply
the

degree
of
obliquity
on

part
and
yet
it
is
safe
to
say
that
of
the
children
who
are
punished
are
punished
for
some
of
these
things
the
remedy
for
these
inconveniences
is
time
and
patience
the
child
if
left
to
himself
without
a
word
of
admonishment
would
probably
change
his
conduct
in
these
respects
merely
by
the
force
of
imitation
provided
that
the
adults
around
him
set
him
a
persistent

of

real

the

that

as

those

which
increase
with

these
it
is
that
need
attention
rather
than
those
that
disappear
of
themselves
as
the
child
grows
older
this
rule
ought
to
be
put
in
large
letters
that
every
one
who
has
to
train
children
may
be
daily
reminded
by
it
and
not
exercise
his
soul
and
spend
his

in
trying
to
overcome

own

the
chief
object

in

in

days
is
only

likely
to
be

which
in
itself
may
be

but
which
is
not
foolish
to
him
sidenote
liberty
and
on
the
other
hand
the
child
who
will
have
his
own
way
even
when
he
knows
it
to
be
wrong
should
be
allowed
to
have
it
within
reasonable
limits
richter
says
leave
to
him
the
sorry
victory
only
exercising
sufficient
ingenuity
to
make
sure
that
it
is
a
sorry
one
what
he
must
be
taught
is
that
it
is
not
at
all
a
pleasure
to
have
his
own
way
unless
his
own
way
happens
to
be
right
and
this
he
can
only
be
taught
by
having
his
own
way
when
the
results
are
plainly
disastrous
every
time
that
a
willful
child
does
what
he
wants
to
do
and
suffers
sharply
for
it
he
learns
a
lesson
that
nothing
but
this
experience
can
teach
him
sidenote
but
his
suffering
must
be
plainly
seen
to
be
the
result
of
his
deed
and
not
the
result
of
his
mother
anger
for
example
a
very
young
child
who
is
determined
to
play
with
fire
may
be
allowed
to
touch
the
hot
lamp
or
a
stove
whenever
affairs
can
be
so
arranged
that
he
is
not
likely
to
burn
himself
too
severely
one
such
lesson
is
worth
all
the
and
cries
of
no
no
ever
resorted
to
by
anxious
parents
if
he
pulls
down
the
blocks
that
you
have
built
up
for
him
they
should
stay
down
while
you
get
out
of
the
room
if
possible
in
order
to
evade
all
responsibility
for
that
unpleasant
result
prohibitions
are
almost
useless
in
order
to
convince
yourself
of
this
get
some
one
to
command
you
not
to
move
your
right
arm
or
to
wink
your
eye
you
will
find
it
almost
impossible
to
obey
for
even
a
few
moments
the
desire
to
move
your
arm
which
was
not
at
all
conscious
before
will
become
overpowering
the
prohibition
acts
like
a
suggestion
and
is
an
implication
that
you
would
do
the
negative
act
unless
you
were
commanded
not
to
miss
alcott
in
little
men
well
illustrates
this
fact
in
the
story
of
the
children
who
were
told
not
to
put
beans
up
their
noses
and
who
straightway
filled
their
noses
with
beans
sidenote
positive
commands
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
section
froebel
meets
this
difficulty
by
substituting
positive
commands
for
prohibitions
that
is
he
tells
the
child
to
do
instead
of
telling
him
not
to
do
tiedemann

that
example
is
the
first
great
evolutionary
teacher
and
liberty
is
the
second
in
the
overcoming
of
disobedience
no
other
teachers
are
needed
the
method
may
be
tedious
it
may
be
many
years
before
the
erratic
will
is
finally
led
to
work
in

channels

there
is
no

of
abridging
the
process
there
is
no
short
and
sudden
cure
for
disobedience
and
the
only
hope
for
final
cure
is
the
steady
working
of
these
two
great
forces
and
to
illustrate

quick
temper
this
as
well
as
irritability
and
nervousness
very
often
springs
from
a
wrong
physical
condition
the
digestion
may
be
bad
or
the
child
may
be
overstimulated
he
may
not
be
sleeping
enough
or
may
not
get
enough
outdoor
air
and
exercise
in
some
cases
the
fault
appears
because
the
child
lacks
the
discipline
of
young
companionship
even
the
most
exemplary
adult
can
not
make
up
to
the
child
for
the
influence
of
other
children
he
perceives
the
difference
between
himself
and
these
giants
about
him
and
the
perception
sometimes
makes
him
furious
his
struggling
individuality
finds
it
difficult
to
maintain
itself
under
the
pressure
of
so
many
stronger
personalities
he
makes
therefore
spasmodic
and
violent
attempts
of
and
these
attempts
go
under
the
name
of
fits
of
temper
the
child
who
is
not
ordinarily
strong
enough
to
assert
himself
effectively
will
work
himself
up
into
a
passion
in
order
to
gain
strength
much
as
men
sometimes
stimulate
their
courage
by
liquor
in
fact
passion
is
a
sort
of
moral
intoxication
sidenote
remedy
solitude
and
quiet
but
whether
the
fits
of
passion
are
physical
or
moral
the
immediate
remedy
is
the
same
his
environment
must
be
promptly
changed
and
his
audience
removed
he
needs
solitude
and
quiet
this
does
not
mean
shutting
him
into
a
closet
but
leaving
him
alone
in
a
quiet
room
with
plenty
of
pleasant
things
about
this
gives
an
opportunity
for
the
disturbed
organism
to
right
itself
and
for
the
will
to
recover
its
normal
tone
some
occupation
should
be
at
hand
blocks
or
other
toys
if
he
is
too
young
to
read
a
good
book
or
two
such
as
miss
alcott
little
men
and
little
women
when
he
is
old
enough
to
read
if
he
is
destructive
in
his
passion
he
must
be
put
in
a
room
where
there
are
very
few
breakables
to
tempt
him
if
he
does
break
anything
he
must
be
required
to
help
mend
it
again
to
shout
a
threat
to
this
effect
through
the
door
when
the
storm
of
temper
is
still
on
is
only
to
goad
him
into
fresh
acts
of
rebellion
let
him
alone
while
he
is
in
this
temporarily
insane
state
and
later
when
he
is
sorry
and
wants
to
be
good
help
him
to
repair
the
mischief
he
has
wrought
it
is
as
foolish
to
argue
with
or
to
threaten
the
child
in
this
state
as
it
would
be
were
he
a
patient
in
a
lunatic
asylum
it
is
sometimes
impossible
to
get
an
older
child
to
go
into
retreat
then
since
he
can
not
be
carried
and
he
is
not
open
to
remonstrance
or
commands
go
out
of
the
room
yourself
and
leave
him
alone
there
at
any
cost
loneliness
and
quiet
must
be
brought
to
bear
upon
him
such
outbursts
are
exceedingly
exhausting
using
up
in
a
few
minutes
as
much
energy
as
would
suffice
for
many
days
of
ordinary
activity
after
the
attack
the
child
needs
rest
even
sleep
and
usually
seeks
it
himself
the
desire
should
be
encouraged
sidenote
precautions
to
be
taken
every
reasonable
precaution
should
be
taken
against
the
recurrence
of
the
attacks
for
every
lapse
into
this
excited
state
makes
him
more
certain
the
next
lapse
and
weakens
the
nervous
control
this
does
not
mean
that
you
should
give
up
any
necessary
or
right
regulations
for
fear
of
the
child
temper
if
the
child
sees
that
you
do
this
he
will
on
occasion
deliberately
work
himself
up
into
a
passion
in
order
to
get
his
own
way
but
while
you
do
not
relax
any
just
regulations
you
may
safely
help
him
to
meet
them
give
him
warning
for
instance
do
not
spring
any
disagreeable
commands
upon
him
have
his
duties
as
systematized
as
possible
so
that
he
may
know
what
to
expect
and
do
not
under
any
circumstances
nag
him
nor
allow
other
children
to
tease
him
sullenness
this
fault
likewise
often
has
a
physical
cause
seated
very
frequently
in
the
liver
see
that
the
child
food
is
not
too
heavy
give
him
much
fruit
and
insist
upon
vigorous
exercise
out
of
doors
or
he
may
perhaps
not
have
enough
childish
pleasures
for
while
most
children
are
overstimulated
there
still
remain
some
children
whose
lives
are
unduly
colorless
and
eventless
a
sullen
child
is
below
the
normal
level
of
responsiveness
he
needs
to
be
roused
wakened
lifted
out
of
himself
and
made
to
take
an
active
interest
in
other
persons
and
in
the
outside
world
sidenote
inheritance
and
example
in
many
cases
sullenness
is
an
inherited
disposition
intensified
by
example
it
is
unchildlike
and
morbid
to
an
unusual
degree
and
very
difficult
to
cure
the
mother
of
a
sullen
child
may
well
look
to
her
own
conduct
and
examine
with
a
searching
eye
the
peculiarities
of
her
own
family
and
of
her
husband
she
may
then
find
the
cause
of
the
evil
and
by
removing
the
child
from
the
bad
example
and
seeing
to
it
that
every
day
contains
a
number
of
childish
pleasures
she
may
win
him
away
from
a
fault
that
will
otherwise
cloud
his
whole
life
lying
all
lies
are
not
bad
nor
all
liars
immoral
a
young
child
who
can
not
yet
understand
the
obligations
of
truthfulness
can
not
be
held
morally
accountable
for
his
departure
from
truth
lying
is
of
three
kinds
imaginative
evasive
politic
sidenote
imaginative
lying
it
is
rather
hard
to
call
the
imaginative
lie
a
lie
at
all
it
is
so
closely
related
to
the
creative
instinct
which
makes
the
poet
and
novelist
and
which
common
among
the
peasantry
of
a
nation
is
responsible
for
and
mythology
that
it
is
rather
an
intellectual
activity
misdirected
than
a
moral
obliquity
very
imaginative
children
often
do
not
know
the
difference
between
what
they
imagine
and
what
they
actually
see
their
minds
eye
sees
as
vividly
as
their
bodily
eye
and
therefore
they
even
believe
their
own
statements
every
attempt
at
contradiction
only
brings
about
a
fresh
assertion
of
the
impossible
which
to
the
child
becomes
more
and
more
certain
as
he
hears
himself
affirming
its
existence
punishment
is
of
no
use
at
all
in
the
attempt
to
regulate
this
exuberance
the
child
large
statements
should
be
smiled
at
and
passed
over
in
the
meantime
he
should
be
encouraged
in
every
possible
way
to
get
a
firm
grasp
of
the
actual
world
about
him
manual
training
if
it
can
be
obtained
is
of
the
greatest
advantage
and
for
a
very
young
child
the
performance
every
day
of
some
little
act
which
demands
accuracy
and
close
attention
is
necessary
for
the
rest
wait
this
is
one
of
the
faults
that
disappear
with
age
sidenote
the
lie
of
evasion
the
lie
of
evasion
is
a
form
of
lying
which
seldom
appears
when
the
relations
between
child
and
parents
are
absolutely
friendly
and
open
however
the
child
who
is
very
desirous
of
approval
may
find
it
difficult
to
own
up
to
a
fault
even
when
he
is
certain
that
the
consequence
of
his
offense
will
not
be
at
all
terrible
this
is
the
more
difficult
because
the
more
subtle
condition
it
is
obvious
that
the
child
who
lies
merely
to
avoid
punishment
can
be
cured
of
that
fault
by
removing
from
him
the
fear
of
punishment
to
this
end
he
should
be
informed
that
there
will
be
no
punishment
whatever
for
any
fault
that
he
freely
confesses
for
the
chief
object
of
punishment
being
to
make
him
face
his
own
fault
and
to
see
it
as
something
ugly
and
disagreeable
that
object
is
obviously
accomplished
by
a
free
and
open
confession
and
no
further
punishment
is
required
but
when
the
child
in
spite
of
such
reassurance
still
continues
to
lie
both
because
he
can
not
bear
to
have
you
think
him
capable
of
and
because
he
is
not
willing
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
is
capable
of
the
situation
becomes
more
complex
all
you
can
do
is
to
urge
upon
him
the
superior
beauty
of
frankness
to
praise
him
and
love
him
especially
when
he
does
acknowledge
a
fault
thus
leading
him
to
see
that
the
way
to
win
your
approval
that
approval
which
he
desires
so
intensely
is
to
face
his
own
shortcomings
with
a
steady
eye
and
confess
them
to
you
unshrinkingly
sidenote
the
politic
lie
the
politic
lie
is
of
course
the
worst
form
of
lying
partly
because
it
is
so
unchildlike
this
is
the
kind
of
fault
that
will
grow
with
age
and
grow
with
such
rapidity
that
the
mother
must
set
herself
against
it
with
all
the
force
at
her
command
the
child
who
lies
for
policy
sake
in
order
to
achieve
some
end
which
is
most
easily
achieved
by
lying
is
a
child
led
into
by
his
ardent
desire
to
get
something
or
do
something
discover
what
this
something
is
and
help
him
to
get
it
by
more
legitimate
means
if
you
point
out
the
straight
path
and
show
the
goal
well
in
view
at
the
end
of
it
he
may
be
persuaded
not
to
take
the
crooked
path
sidenote
inherited
crookedness
but
there
are
occasionally
natures
that
delight
in
crookedness
and
that
even
in
early
childhood
they
would
rather
go
about
getting
their
heart
desire
in
some
crooked
intricate
underhanded
way
than
by
the
direct
route
such
a
fault
is
almost
certain
to
be
an
inherited
one
and
here
again
a
close
study
of
the
child
relatives
will
often
help
the
mother
to
make
a
good
diagnosis
and
even
suggest
to
her
the
line
of
treatment
sidenote
extreme
cases
in
an
extreme
case
the
family
may
unite
in
disbelieving
the
child
who
lies
not
merely
disbelieving
him
when
he
is
lying
but
disbelieving
him
all
the
time
no
matter
what
he
says
he
must
be
made
to
see
and
that
without
room
for
any
further
doubt
that
the
crooked
paths
that
he
loves
do
not
lead
to
the
goal
his
heart
desires
but
away
from
it
his
words
not
being
true
to
the
facts
have
lost
their
value
and
no
one
around
him
listens
to
them
he
is
as
it
were
rendered
speechless
and
his
favorite
means
of
getting
his
own
way
is
thus
made
utterly
valueless
such
a
remedy
is
in
truth
a
terrible
one
while
it
is
being
administered
the
child
suffers
to
the
limit
of
his
endurance
and
it
is
only
justified
in
an
extreme
case
and
after
the
failure
of
all
gentler
means
jealousy
sidenote
justice
and
love
too
often
this
deadly
evil
is
encouraged
in
infancy
instead
of
being
promptly
uprooted
as
it
ought
to
be
it
is
very
amusing
if
one
does
not
consider
the
consequences
to
sec
a
little
child
slap
and
push
away
the
father
or
the
older
brother
who
attempts
to
kiss
the
mother
but
this
is
another
fault
that
grows
with
years
and
a
fault
so
deadly
that
once
firmly
rooted
it
can
utterly
destroy
the
beauty
and
happiness
of
an
otherwise
lovely
nature
the
first
step
toward
overcoming
it
must
be
to
make
the
reign
of
strict
justice
in
the
home
so
obvious
as
to
remove
all
excuse
for
the
evil
the
second
step
is
to
encourage
the
child
love
for
those
very
persons
of
whom
he
is
most
likely
to
be
jealous
if
he
is
jealous
of
the
baby
give
him
special
care
of
the
baby
jealousy
indicates
a
temperament
overbalanced
emotionally
therefore
put
your
force
upon
the
upbuilding
of
the
child
intellect
give
him
responsibilities
make
him
think
out
things
for
himself
call
upon
him
to
assist
in
the
family
conclaves
in
every
way
cultivate
his
power
of
judgment
the
whole
object
of
the
treatment
should
be
to
strengthen
his
intellect
and
to
accustom
his
emotions
to
find
outlet
in
wholesome
helpful
activity
one
wise
mother
made
it
a
rule
to
pet
the
next
to
the
baby
the
baby
she
said
was
bound
to
be
petted
a
good
deal
because
of
its
helplessness
and
sweetness
therefore
she
made
a
conscious
effort
to
pet
the
next
to
the
youngest
the
one
who
had
just
been
crowded
out
of
the
warm
nest
of
mother
lap
by
the
advent
of
the
newcomer
such
a
rule
would
go
far
to
prevent
the
beginnings
of
jealousy
selfishness
this
is
a
fault
to
which
children
are
especially
liable
the
first
exercise
of
after
it
has
passed
the
stage
of
taking
possession
of
the
child
own
organism
usually
brings
him
into
conflict
with
those
about
him
to
succeed
in
getting
hold
of
a
thing
against
the
wish
of
someone
else
and
to
hold
on
to
it
when
someone
else

it
is
to
win
a
victory
the
coveted
object
becomes
dear
not
so
much
for
its
own
sake
as
because
it
is
a
trophy
such
a
child
knows
not
the
joy
of
sharing
he
knows
only
the
joys
of
wresting
victory
against
odds
this
is
indeed
an
evil
that
grows
with
the
years
the
child
who
holds
onto
his
apple
his
candy
or
toy
fights
tooth
and
nail
everyone
who
wants
to
take
it
from
him
and
resists
all
coaxing
is
liable
to
become
a
hard
sordid
grasping
man
who
stops
at
no
obstacle
to
accomplish
his
purpose
yet
in
the
beginning
this
fault
often
hides
itself
and
escapes
attention
the
selfish
child
may
be
quiet
clean
and
under
ordinary
circumstances
obedient
he
may
not
even
be
quarrelsome
and
may
therefore
come
under
a
much
less
degree
of
discipline
than
his
obstreperous
impulsive
rebellious
little
brother
yet
in
reality
his
condition
calls
for
much
more
careful
attention
than
does
the
condition
of
the
younger
brother
sidenote
the
only
child
however
the
child
who
has
no
brother
at
all
either
older
or
younger
nor
any
sister
is
almost
invited
by
the
fact
of
his
isolation
to
fall
into
this
sin
only
children
may
be
indeed
often
are
precocious
bright
capable
and
but
they
are
seldom
spontaneously
generous
their
own
small
selves
occupy
an
undue
proportion
of
the
family
horizon
and
therefore
of
their
own
sidenote
kindergarten
a
remedy
this
is
where
the
kindergarten
has
its
great
value
in
the
true
kindergarten
the
children
live
under
a
dispensation
of
loving
justice
and
selfishness
betrays
itself
instantly
there
because
it
is
alien
to
the
whole
spirit
of
the
place
showing
itself
it
is
promptly
condemned
and
the
child
stands
convicted
by
the
only
tribunal
whose
verdict
really
moves
him
a
jury
of
his
peers
normal
children
hate
selfishness
and
condemn
it
and
the
selfish
child
himself
following
the
strong
childish
impulse
of
imitation
learns
to
hate
his
own
fault
and
so
quick
is
the
forgiveness
of
children
that
he
needs
only
to
begin
to
repent
before
the
circle
of
his
mates
receives
him
again
this
is
one
reason
why
the
kindergarten
takes
children
at
such
an
early
age
aiming
as
it
does
to
lay
the
foundations
for
right
thinking
and
feeling
it
must
begin
before
wrong
foundations
are
too
deeply
laid
its
gentle
searching
methods
straighten
the
strong
will
that
is
growing
crooked
and
strengthen
the
enfeebled
one
sidenote
intimate
association
a
help
but
if
the
selfish
child
is
too
old
for
the
kindergarten
he
should
belong
to
a
club
consistent
selfishness
will
not
long
be
tolerated
here
the
tacit
or
outspoken
rebuke
of
his
mates
has
many
times
the
force
of
a
domestic
rebuke
because
thereby
he
sees
himself
at
least
for
a
time
as
his
comrades
see
him
and
never
thereafter
entirely
loses
his
suspicion
that
they
may
be
right
their
individual
judgment
he
may
defy
but
their
collective
judgment
has
in
it
an
almost
magical
power
and
convinces
him
in
spite
of
himself
sidenote
cultivate
affections
whatever
strong
affections
the
selfish
boy
shows
most
be
carefully
cultivated
love
for
another
is
the
only
sure
cure
for
selfishness
if
he
loves
animals
let
him
have
pets
and
give
into
his
hands
the
whole
responsibility
for
the
care
of
them
it
is
better
to
let
the
poor
animals
suffer
some
neglect
than
to
take
away
from
the
boy
the
responsibility
for
their
condition
they
serve
him
only
so
far
as
he
can
be
induced
to
serve
them
the
chief
rule
for
the
cure
of
selfishness
is
then
to
watch
every
affection
small
and
large
encourage
it
give
it
room
to
grow
and
see
to
it
that
the
child
does
not
merely
get
delight
out
of
it
but
that
he
works
for
it
that
he
sacrifices
himself
for
those
whom
he
loves
laziness
sidenote
the
physical
cause
this
condition
is
often
normal
especially
during
adolescence
the
developing
boy
or
girl
wants
to
lop
and
to
lounge
to
lie
sprawled
over
the
floor
or
the
sofa
quick
movement
is
distasteful
to
him
and
often
has
an
undue
effect
upon
the
heart
action
he
is
normally
dreamy
languid
indifferent
and
subject
to
various
moods
these
things
are
merely
tokens
of
the
tremendous
change
that
is
going
on
within
his
organism
and
which
heavily
drains
his
vitality
certain
duties
may
of
course
be
required
of
him
at
this
stage
but
they
should
be
light
and
steady
he
should
not
be
expected
to
fill
up
chinks
and
run
errands
with
joyful
alacrity
the
or
may
be
called
upon
for
these
things
and
not
he
harmed
but
this
is
not
true
of
the
child
between
twelve
and
seventeen
he
has
absorbing
business
on
hand
and
should
not
be
too
often
called
away
from
it
sidenote
laziness
and
rapid
growth
laziness
ordinarily
accompanies
rapid
growth
of
any
kind
the
unusually
large
child
even
if
he
has
not
yet
reached
the
period
of
adolescence
is
likely
to
be
lazy
his
nervous
energies
are
deflected
to
keep
up
his
growth
and
his
intelligence
is
often
temporarily
dulled
by
the
rapidity
of
his
increase
in
size
sidenote
hurry
not
natural
moreover
it
is
not
natural
for
any
child
to
hurry
hurry
is
in
itself
both
a
result
of
nervous
strain
and
a
cause
of
it
and
grown
people
whose
nerves
have
been
permanently
wrenched
away
from
normal
quietude
and
steadiness
often
form
a
habit
of
hurry
which
makes
them
both
unfriendly
toward
children
and
very
bad
for
children
these
young
creatures
ought
to
go
along
through
their
days
rather
dreamily
and
altogether
serenely
every
turn
of
the
screw
to
tighten
their
nerves
makes
more
certain
some
form
of
early
nervous
breakdown
they
ought
to
have
work
to
do
of
course
enough
of
it
to
occupy
both
mind
and
body
but
it
should
be
quiet
systematic
regular
work
much
of
it
performed
automatically
only
occasionally
should
they
be
required
to
do
things
with
a
conscious
effort
to
attain
speed
sidenote
abnormal
laziness
however
there
is
a
degree
of
laziness
difficult
of
definition
which
is
abnormal
the
child
fails
to
perform
any
work
with
regularity
and
falls
behind
both
at
school
and
at
home
this
may
be
the
result
of
or
it
may
be
first
symptom
of
some
poor
assimilation
may
show
itself
either
by
a
thinness

anaemia
anaemia
betrays
itself
most
characteristically
by
the
color
of
the
lips
and
gums
these
instead
of
being
red
are
a
pale
yellowish
pink
and
the
whole
complexion
has
a
sort
of
waxy
pallor
in
extreme
cases
this
pallor
even
becomes
greenish
as
the
disease
is
accompanied
with
little
pain
and
few
if
any
marked
symptoms
beyond
sleepiness
and
weakness
it
often
exists
for
some
time
without
being
suspected
by
the
parents
the
advent
of
many
other
diseases
is
announced
by
a
languid
indifference
to
surroundings
and
a
slow
response
to
the
customary
stimuli
the
child
brain
seems
clouded
and
a
light
form
of
torpor
invades
the
whole
body
the
child
who
is
usually
active
and
interested
in
things
about
him
but
who
loses
his
activity
and
becomes
dull
and
irresponsive
should
be
carefully
watched
it
may
be
that
he
is
merely
changing
his
form
of
growth
is
beginning
to
grow
tall
after
completion
of
his
period
of
laying
on
flesh
or
vice
versa
or
he
may
be
entering
upon
the
period
of
adolescence
but
if
it
is
neither
of
these
things
a
physician
should
be
consulted

be
induced

monotonous

as
attractive
as
possible
for
of
course
you
do
not
require
him
to
perform
these
duties
for
your
sake
whatever
you
allow
him
to
suppose
about
it
but
chiefly
for
the
sake
of
their
influence
on
his
character
therefore
if
the
influence
of
any
work
is
bad
you
will
change
it
although
the
new
work
may
not
be
nearly
so

you
prefer
to
have
him
do
whatever
the

even
when

only
in

he
might
well
become

those
fortunate
persons
who
love
to
work
this
is
the
real
time
for
preventing
laziness
but
if
this
early
period
has
been
missed
the
next
best
thing
is
to
take
advantage
of
every
spontaneous
interest
as
it
arises
to
hitch
the
impulse
as
it
were
to
some
task
that
must
be
steadily
performed
for

if
the
child
wants
to
play
with
tools
help
him
to
make
a
small
or
any
other
interesting
contrivance
and
keep
him
at
it
by
various
devices
until
he
has
brought
it
to
a
fair
degree
of
completion
your
aim
is
to
stretch
his
will
each
time

to
do
something
a
little
further
than
it
tends
to
go
of
itself
to
let
him
work

past

that

essentially
a

as
this
is
we
must
beware
how
we

it
by

severe
adult
standard
it
is
not

for
any

to
take
an

even
the

are
cared
for
in
this
respect
by
their

the
cow
licks
her
calf
the
cat
her
kittens
and
neither
calf
nor
kittens
seem
to
take
much
interest
in
the
process
the
conscious
love
of
cleanliness
and
order
grows
with
years
and
seems
to
be
largely
a
matter
of
custom
the
child
who
has
always
lived
in
decent
surroundings
finds
them
necessary
to
his
comfort
and
is
willing
to
make
a
degree
of
effort
to
secure
them
on
the
contrary
the

the
obvious
method
of
overcoming
this
difficulty
then
is
not
to
chide
the
child
for
the

but
to
make
him
so
accustomed
to
pleasant
surroundings
that
he
not
help

them
the
whole
process

is

it
consists
in
waiting

yourself
two

three
times
a
day
and
showing
your
delight
in
his

dressing
him
so
simply
that
he
keeps
in
respectable
order
without
the
necessity
of
a
painful
amount
of
attention
he
is
to
be
accustomed
to
orderly
surroundings
and
though
you
ordinarily
require
him
to
put
away
some
of
his
things
himself
you
do
also
assist
this
process
by
putting
away
a
good
deal
to
which
you
do
not
call

you
make
your

pretty
and

also

his
love
for
you
may
lead
him
into
a
love
for

a
few
set
observances
may
be
safely
and
steadfastly
demanded
but
these
should
be

as
that

should
not

in
the

that
is

formed
impudence
impudence
is
largely
due
to
lack

to
a
double

sidenote
lack

in
the

too
much
must
not
be
expected
of
the
young
savages
in

nursery
remember
that
the
children
there
are
in
a
state
very
much
more
nearly
resembling
that
of
savage
or
nation
than
resembling
your
own
and
that
therefore
while
they
will
undoubtedly
take
kindly
to
showy
ceremonial
they
are
not
ripe
yet
for
most
of
the
delicate
observances
at
best
you
can
only
hope
to
get
the
crude
material
of
good
manners
from
them
you
can
hope
that
they
will
be
in
the
main
kind
in
intention
and
as
courteous
under
provocation
as
is
consistent
with
their
stage
of
development
if
you
secure
this
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
unduly
over
occasional
lapses
into
perfectly
innocent
and
wholesome
barbarism
good
manners
are
in
the
main
dependent
upon
quick
sympathies
because
sympathies
develop
the
perceptions
a
child
is
much
less
likely
to
hurt
the
feelings
or
shock
the
sensibilities
of
a
person
whom
he
loves
tenderly
than
of
one
for
whom
he
cares
very
little
this
is
the
chief
reason
why
all
children
are
much
more
likely
to
be
offensive
in
speech
and
action
before
strangers
than
when
alone
in
the
bosom
of
their
families
they
are
so
far
from
caring
what
a
stranger
thinks
or
feels
that
they
can
not
even
forecast
his
displeasure
nor
imagine
its
reaction
upon
mother
or
father
the
more
then
that
the
sympathies
are
broadened
the
more
he
is
encouraged
to
take
an
interest
in
all
people
even
strangers
the
better
mannered
will
he
become
sidenote
bad

bad
example
is
more
common
than
is
usually
supposed
very
few
parents
are
consistently
courteous
toward
their
children
they
permit
themselves
a
sharp
tone
of
voice
and
rough
and
abrupt
habits
of
speech
that
would
scarcely
be
tolerated
by
any
adult
even
an
otherwise
gentle
and
amiable
woman
is
often
disagreeable
in
her
manner
toward
her
children
commanding
them
to
do
things
in
a
way
well
calculated
to
excite
opposition
and
rebuking
in
unmeasured
terms
she
usually
reserves
her
soft
and
gentle
speeches
for
her
own
friends
and
for
her
husband
yet
discourtesy
can
not
begin
to
harm
them
as
it
harms
her
children
it
is
true
that
the
children
are
often
under
foot
when
she
is
busiest
when
indeed
she
is
so
distracted
as
to
not
be
able
to
think
about
manners
but
if
she
would
acknowledge
to
herself
that
she
ought
to
be
polite
and
that
when
she
fails
to
be
it
is
because
she
has
yielded
to
temptation
and
if
moreover
she
would
make
this
acknowledgment
openly
to
her
children
and
beg
their
pardon
for
her
sharp
words
as
she
expects
them
to
beg
hers
the
spirit
of
courtesy
at
any
rate
would
prevail
in
her
house
and
would
influence

to
forgive
an
acknowledged
fault

in
detecting

sidenote
double
standard
the
most
fertile
cause
of
impudence
is
assumption
of
a
double
standard
of
morality
one
for
the
child
and
another
for
the
adult
impudence
is
at
bottom
the
child
perception
of
this
injustice
and
his
rebellion
against
it
when
to
this
double
standard
a
standard
that
measures
up
gossip
for
instance
right
for
the
adult
and
listening
to
gossip
as
wrong
for
the
child
when
to
this
is
added
the
assumption
of
infallibility
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
child
fairly
rages
for
if
we
come
to
analyze
them
what
are
the
speeches
which
find
so
objectionable
do
it
yourself
if
you
are
so
smart
maybe
i
am
rude
but
i
not
any
ruder
than
you
are
i
think
you
are
just
as
mean
as
mean
can
be
i
would
be
so
mean
is
this
last
speech
any
worse
in
reality
than
you
are
a
very
naughty
little
girl
and
i
am
ashamed
of
you
and
all
sorts
of
other
expressions
of
candid
adverse
opinion
besides
these
forms
of
impudence
there
is
the
peculiarly
irritating
well
you
do
it
yourself
i
guess
i
can
if
you
can
in
all
these
cases
the
child
is
partly
it
the
right
he
is
stating
the
feet
as
he
sees
it
and
violently
asserting
that
you
are
not
privileged
to
demand
more
of
him
than
of
yourself
the
evil
comes
in
through
the
fact
that
he
is
doing
it
in
an
ugly
spirit
he
is
not
only
desirous
of
stating
the
truth
but
of
putting
you
in
the
wrong
and
himself
in
the
right
and
if
this
hurts
you
so
much
the
better
all
this
is
because
he
is
angry
and
therefor
in
impudence
the
true
evil
to
be
overcome
is
the
evil
of
anger
sidenote
example
show
him
then
that
you
are
open
to
correction
admit
the
justice
of
the
rebuke
as
far
as
you
can
and
set
him
an
example
of
careful
courtesy
and
forbearance
at
the
very
moment
when
these
traits
are
most
conspicuously
lacking
in
him
if
some
special
point
is
involved
some
question
of
privilege
quietly
but
very
firmly
defer
the
consideration
of
it
until
he
is
master
of
himself
and
can
discuss
the
situation
with
an
open
mind
and
in
a
courteous
manner
corporal
punishment
in
all
these
examples
which
are
merely
suggestive
it
is
impossible
to
lay
down
an
absolute
moral
recipe
because
circumstances
so
truly
alter
cases
in
all
these
no
mention
is
made
of
corporal
punishment
this
is
because
corporal
punishment
is
never
necessary
never
right
but
is
always
harmful
sidenote
moral
confusion
there
are
three
principal
reasons
why
it
should
not
be
resorted
to
because
it
is
indiscriminate
to
inflict
bodily
pain
as
a
consequence
of
widely
various
faults
leads
to
moral
confusion
the
child
who
is
spanked
for
lying
spanked
for
disobedience
and
spanked
again
for
tearing
his
clothes
is
likely
enough
to
consider
these
three
things
as
much
the
same
as
at
any
rate
of
equal
importance
because
they
all
lead
to
the
same
result
this
is
to
lay
the
foundation
for
a
permanent
moral
confusion
and
a
man
who
can
not
see
the
nature
of
a
wrong
deed
and
its
relative
importance
is
incapable
of
guiding
himself
or
others
corporal
punishment
teaches
a
child
nothing
of
the
reason
why
what
he
does
is
wrong
wrong
must
seem
to
him
to
be
dependent
upon
the
will
of
another
and
its
disagreeable
consequences
to
be
escapable
if
only
he
can
evade
the
will
of
that
other
sidenote
fear
versus
love
corporal
punishment
is
wrong
because
it
inculcates
fear
of
pain
as
the
motive
for
conduct
instead
of
love
of
righteousness
it
tends
directly
to
cultivate
cowardice
deceitfulness
and
anger
three
faults
worse
than
almost
any
fault
against
which
it
can
be
employed
true
some
persons
grow
up
both
gentle
and
straightforward
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
have
been
whipped
in
their
youth
but
it
is
in
spite
of
and
not
because
of
it
in
their
homes
other
good
qualities
must
have
counteracted
the
pernicious
effect
of
this
mistaken
procedure
sidenote
sensibilities
blunted
corporal
punishment
may
indeed
achieve
immediate
results
such
as
seem
at
the
moment
to
be
eminently
desirable
the
child
if
he
be
young
enough
weak
enough
and
helpless
enough
may
be
made
to
do
almost
anything
by
fear
of
the
rod
and
some
of
the
things
he
may
thus
be
made
to
do
may
be
exactly
the
things
that
he
ought
to
do
and
this
certainty
of
result
is
exactly
what
prompts
many
otherwise
just
and
thoughtful
persons
to
the
use
of
corporal
punishment
but
these
good
results
are
obtained
at
the
expense
of
the
future
the
effect
of
each
spanking
is
a
little
less
than
the
effect
of
the
preceding
one
the
child
sensibilities
blunt
as
in
the
case
of
a
man
with
the
drug
habit
it
requires
a
larger
and
larger
dose
to
produce
the
required
effect
that
is
if
he
is
a
strong
child
capable
of
enduring
and
resisting
much
if
on
the
contrary
he
is
a
weak
child
whose
slow
budding
will
come
only
timidly
into
existence
one
or
two
whippings
followed
by
threats
may
suffice
to
keep
him
in
a
permanently
cowed
condition
incapable
of
initiative
incapable
of
spontaneity
the
method
of
discipline
here
indicated
while
it
is
more
searching
than
any
corporal
punishment
does
not
have
any
of
its
disadvantages
it
is
more
searching
because
it
never
blunts
the
sensibilities
but
rather
tends
to
refine
them
and
to
make
them
more
responsive
sidenote
educative
discipline
sidenote
permanent
results
the
child
thus
trained
should
become
more
susceptible
day
by
day
to
gentle
and
elevating
influences
this
discipline
is
educative
explaining
to
the
child
why
what
he
does
is
wrong
showing
him
the
painful
effects
as
inherent
in
the
deed
itself
he
can
not
therefore
conceive
of
himself
as
being
ever
set
free
from
the
obligation
to
do
right
for
that
obligation
within
his
experience
does
not
rest
upon
his
mother
will
or
ability
to
inflict
punishment
but
upon
the
very
nature
of
the
universe
of
which
he
is
a
part
the
effects
of
such
discipline
are
therefore
permanent
that
which
happens
to
the
child
in
the
nursery
also
happens
to
him
in
the
great
world
when
he
reaches
manhood
his
nursery
training
interprets
and
orders
the
world
for
him
he
comes
therefore

the

with
various

before
the
question

misconception
on
the
part
of
the
reader
must
be
guarded
against
and
these
misconceptions
generally
arise
from
a
feeling
that
beautiful
as
his

philosophy
may

there
are
some
children
too
bad
to

at

that

we
have
endeavored
to
show
in
detail
how
this
method
applies
to
a
representative
list
of
faults
and
shortcomings
and
having
thus
we
hope
proved
that
the
method
is
applicable
to
a
wide
range
of
cases
indeed
to
all
possible
cases
we
will
proceed
to
recount
the
fundamental
principles
which
froebel
and
before

enunciated

times
who
adhere
to
the
new
education
are
working
out
into

of

sidenote
object
of
moral
training
as
previously
stated
the
object
of
the
moral
training
of
the
child
is
the
inculcation
of
the
love
of
righteousness
froebel
is
not
concerned
with
laying
down
a
mass
of
observances
which
the
child
must
follow
and
which
the
parents
must
insist
upon
he
thinks
rather
that
the
child
nature
once
turned
into
the
right
direction
and
surrounded
by
right
influences
will
grow
straight
without
constant
yankings
and
twistings
the
child
who
loves
to
do
right
is
safe
he
may
make
mistakes
as
to
what
the
right
is
but
he
will
learn
by
these
mistakes
and
will
never
go
far
astray
sidenote
the
reason
why
however
it
is
well
to
save
him
as
far
as
possible
from
the
pain
of
these
mistakes
we
need
to
preserve
in
him
what
has
already
been
implanted
there
the
love
of
understanding
the
reasons
for
conduct
when
the
child
asks
why
therefore
he
should
seldom
be
told
because
mother
says
so
this
is
to
deny
a
rightful
activity
of
his
young
mind
to
give
him
a
monotonous
and
insufficient
reason
temporary
in
its
nature
instead
of
a
lasting
reason
which
will
remain
with
him
through
life
dante
says
all
those
who
have
lost
what
he
calls
the
good
of
the
intellect
are
in
the
inferno
and
when
you
refuse
to
give
your
child
satisfactory
reasons
for
the
conduct
you
require
of
him
you
refuse
to
cultivate
in
him
that
very
good
of
the
intellect
which
is
necessary
for
his
salvation
sidenote
advantage
of
positive
commands
as
soon
however
as
your
commands
become
positive
instead
of
negative
the
difficulty
of
meeting
the
situation
begins
to
disappear
it
is
usually
much
easier
to
tell
the
child
why
he
should
do
a
thing
than
why
he
should
not
do
its
opposite
for
example
it
is
much
easier
to
make
him
see
that
he
ought
to
be
a
helpful
member
of
the
family
than
to
make
him
understand
why
he
should
stop
making
a
loud
noise
or
refrain
from
waking
up
the
baby
there
is
something
in
the
child
which
in
calm
moments
recognizes
that
love
demands
some
sacrifice
to
this
something
you
must
appeal
and
these
calm
moments
for
the
most
part
you
must
choose
for
making
the
appeal
the
effort
is
to
prevent
the
appearance
of
evil
by
the
active
presence
of
good
the
child
who
is
busy
trying
to
be
good
has
little
time
to
be
naughty
sidenote
original
goodness
froebel
most
characteristic
utterance
is
perhaps
this
a
suppressed
or
perverted
good
quality
a
good
tendency
only
repressed
misunderstood
or
misguided
lies
originally
at
the
bottom
of
every
shortcoming
in
man
hence
the
only
and
infallible
remedy
for
counteracting
any
shortcoming
and
even
wickedness
is
to
find
the
originally
good
source
the
originally
good
side
of
the
human
being
that
has
been
repressed
disturbed
or
misled
into
the
shortcoming
and
then
to
foster
build
up
and
properly
guide
this
good
side
thus
the
shortcoming
will
at
last
disappear
although
it
may
involve
a
hard
struggle
against
habit
but
not
against
original
depravity
in
man
and
this
is
accomplished
so
much
the
more
rapidly
and
surely
because
man
himself
tends
to
abandon
his
shortcomings
for
man
prefers
right
to
wrong
the
natural
deduction
from
this
is
that
we
should
say
do
rather
than
do
open
up
the
natural
way
for
rightful
activity
instead
of
uttering
loud
warning
cries
at
the
entrance
to
every
wrong
path
sidenote
kindergarten
methods
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
kindergarten
tries
by
every
means
to
make
right
doing
delightful
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
for
its
songs
dances
plays
its
bright
colors
birds
and
flowers
and
in
this
respect
it
may
well
be
imitated
in
every
home
no
one
loves
that
which
is
disagreeable
ugly
and
forbidding
yet
many
little
children
are
expected
to
love
right
doing
which
is
seldom
attractively
presented
to
them
the
results
of
such
treatment
are
apparent
in
the
grown
people
of
most
persons
have
an
underlying
conviction
that
sinners
or
at
any
rate
unconscientious
persons
have
a
much
easier
and
pleasanter
time
of
it
than
those
who
try
to
do
right
to
the
imagination
of
the
majority
of
adults
sin
is
dressed
in
glittering
colors
and
virtue
in
gray
somber
garments
there
are
few
who
do
not
take
credit
for
right
doing
as
if
they
had
chosen
a
hard
and
disagreeable
part
instead
of
the
more
alluring
ways
of
wrong
this
is
because
they
have
been
in
childhood
and
have
come
to
think
of
wrongdoing
as
pleasant
and
virtue
as
hard
whereas
the
real
truth
is
exactly
the
opposite
it
is
wrongdoing
that
brings
unpleasant
consequences
and
virtue
that
brings
happiness
sidenote
right
doing
made
easy
there
are
those
who
object
that
by
the
kindergarten
method
right
doing
is
made
too
easy
the
children
do
not
have
to
put
forth
enough
effort
they
say
they
are
not
called
upon
to
endure
sufficient
pain
they
do
not
have
the
discipline
which
causes
them
to
choose
right
no
matter
how
painful
right
may
be
for
the
moment
whether
this
dictum
is
ever
true
or
not
it
certainly
is
not
true
in
early
childhood
the
love
of
righteousness
needs
to
be
firmly
rooted
in
the
character
before
it
is
strained
and
pulled
upon
we
do
not
start
seedlings
in
the
rocky
soil
or
plant
out
saplings
in
time
of
frost
if
tests
and
trials
of
virtue
must
come
let
them
come
in
later
life
when
the
love
of
virtue
is
so
firmly
established
that
it
may
be
trusted
to
find
a
way
to
its
own
satisfaction
through
whatever
difficulties
may
oppose
sidenote
neighbors
opinions
in
the
very
beginning
of
any
effort
to
live
up
to
requirements
it
is
evident
that
children
must
not
be
measured
by
the
way
they
appear
to
the
neighbors
this
is
to
reaffirm
the
power
of
that
rigid
tradition
which
has
warped
so
many
young
lives
she
who
is
trying
to
fix
her
child
heart
upon
true
and
holy
things
may
well
disregard
her
neighbor
comments
on
the
child
manners
or
clothes
or
even
upon
momentary
ebullitions
of
temper
she
is
working
below
the
surface
of
things
is
setting
eternal
forces
to
work
and
she
can
not
afford
to
interrupt
this
work
for
the
sake
of
shining
the
child
up
with
any
premature
outside
polish
if
she
is
to
have
any
peace
of
mind
or
to
allow
any
to
the
child
if
she
is
to
live
in
any
way
a
simple
and
serene
life
she
must
establish
a
few
fundamental
principles
by
which
she
judges
her
child
conduct
and
regulates
her
own
and
stand
by
these
principles
through
thick
and
thin
sidenote
the
family
republic
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
principle
is
that
enunciated
by
fichte
each
man
he
says
is
a
free
being
in
a
world
of
other
free
beings
therefore
his
freedom
is
limited
only
by
the
freedom
of
the
other
free
beings
that
is
they
must
divide
the
world
amongst
them
stated
in
the
form
of
a
command
he
says
again
restrict
your
freedom
through
the
freedom
of
all
other
persons
with
whom
you
come
in
contact
this
is
a
rule
that
even
a
child
can
be
made
to
understand
and
it
is
astonishing
with
what
readiness
he
will
admit
its
justice
he
call
do
anything
he
wants
to
you
explain
to
him
except
bother
other
people
and
of
course
the
corollary
follows
that
every
one
else
can
do
whatever
he
pleases
except
to
bother
the
child
sidenote
rights
of
others
this
clear
and
simple
doctrine
can
be
driven
home
with
amazing
force
if
you
strictly
respect
the
child
right
as
you
require
him
to
respect
yours
you
should
neither
allow
any
encroachments
upon
your
own
proper
privileges
except
so
far
as
you
explain
that
this
is
only
a
loving
permission
on
your
part
and
not
to
be
assumed
as
a
precedent

so
that
he

put
his
small

in

before
obeying
your
command
the
more
carefully
you
do
this
the
more
willing
will
be
his
response
on
the
infrequent
occasions
when
you
must
demand
immediate
attention
in
some
such
fashion
you
teach
the
child
to
respect
the
rights
of
others
by
scrupulously
respecting
those
rights
to
which
he
is
most
alive
namely
his
own
the
next
step
is
to
require
him
with
you
to
think
out
the
rights
of
others
and
both
of
you
together
should
shape
your
conduct
so
as
to
leave
these
rights
unfringed

share
in

as
soon
as
the
young
child
will
has
fully
taken
possession
of
his
own

he
will
inevitably
try
to
rule
yours
the
establishment
of
the
law
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
will
go
far
toward
regulating
this
desire
but
still
he
must
be
allowed
in
some
degree
to
rule
others
because
power
to
rule
others
is
likely
to
be
at
some
time
during
his
life
of
great
importance
to
him
to
thwart
him
absolutely
in
this
respect
never
yielding
yourself
to
his
imperious
demands
is
alike
impossible
and
undesirable
his
will
must
not
be
shut
up
to
himself
and
to
the
things
that
he
can
make
himself
do
in
various
ways
with
due
consideration
for

with

with
modesty
he
may
well
be
encouraged
to
do
his

and
while
of
course
he
will
not
begin
his
ruling
in
such
restrained
and
thoughtful
fashion
as
is
implied
by
these
limitations
yet
he
must
be
suffered
to
begin
and
the
rule
for
the
respect
of
the
rights
of
others
should
be
suffered
gradually
to
work
out
these
modifications
a
safe
distinction
may
be
made
as
follows
permit
him
since
he
is
so
helpless
to
rule
and
persuade
others
to
satisfy
his
legitimate
desires
such
as
the
desire
for
food
sleep
affection
and
knowledge
but
when
be
demands

reserve
your
own
liberty
of
choice
so
as
to
clearly
demonstrate
to
him
that
you
are
exercising
choice
and
in
doing
so
are
well
within
your
own
rights
sidenote
low
voice
commands
there
is
one
simple
outward
observation
which
greatly
assists
us
the
inculcation
of
these
fundamental
truths
that
is
the
habit
of
using
a
low
voice
in
speaking
especially
when
issuing
a
command
or
administering
a
rebuke
a
loud
insistent
voice
practically
insures
rebellion
this
is
because
the
low
voice
means
that
you
have
command
of
yourself
the
loud
voice
that
you
have
lost
it
the
child
submits
to
a
controlled
will
but
not
to
one
as
uncontrolled
as
his
own
in
both
cases
he
follows
your
example
if
you
are
he
tends
to
become
so
if
you
are
excited
and
angry
he
also
becomes
so
or
if
he
is
already
so
his
excitement
and
anger
increases
while
most
mothers
rely
altogether
too
much
upon
speech
as
a
means
of
explaining
life
to
the
child
yet
it
must
be
admitted
that
speech
has
a
great
function
to
perform
in
this
regard
nevertheless
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
it
is
not
true
that
a
child
will
always
do
what
you
tell
him
to
do
no
matter
how
plain
you
may
tell
him
nor
how
perfectly
you
may
explain
your
reasons
sidenote
limitations
of
words
in
the
first
place
speech
means
less
to
children
than
to
grown
persons
each
word
has
a
smaller
content
of
experience
they
can
not
get
the
full
force
of
the
most
clear
and
eloquent
statement
therefore
all
speech
must
be
reinforced
by
example
and
by
as
many
forms
of
concrete
illustrations
as
can
be
commanded
each
necessary
truth
should
enter
the
child
mind
by
several
channels
hearing
motor
activity
should
all
be
called
upon
many
truths
may
be
dramatized
this
where
the
mother
is
clever
enough
to
employ
it
is
the
surest
method
of
appeal
but
in
any
case
speech
alone
must
not
be
relied
upon
nor
the
child
considered
a
hopeless
case
who
does
not
respond
to
it
denunciatory
speech
especially
needs
wise
regulation
as
richter
says
what
is
to
be
followed
as
a
rule
of
prudence
yea
of
justice
toward
people
should
be
much
more
observed
toward
children
namely
that
one
should
never
judgingly
declare
for
instance
are
a
liar
or
even
are
a
bad
boy
instead
of
saying
have
told
an
untruth
or
have
done
wrong
for
since
the
power
to
command
yourself
implies
at
the
same
time
the
power
of
obeying
man
feels
a
minute
after
his
fault
as
free
as
socrates
and
the
branding
mark
of
his
not
his
must
seem
to
him
blameworthy
of
punishment
to
this
must
be
added
that
every
individual
wrong
actions
owing
to
his
inalienable
sense
of
a
moral
aim
and
hope
seem
to
him
only
short
usurped
interregnums
of
the
devil
or
comets
in
the
uniform
solar
system
the
child
consequently
under
such
a
moral
annihilation
feels
the
of
others
more
than
his
own
and
this
all
the
more
because
in
him
want
of
reflection
and
the
general
warmth
of
his
feelings
represent
the
injustice
of
others
in
a
more
ugly
light
than
his
own
sidenote
example
versus
precept
if
any
one
desires
to
prove
the
superior
force
of
example
over
precept
let
him
try
teaching
a
baby
to
say
thank
you
or
please
merely
by
being
scrupulously
careful
to
say
these
things
to
the
baby
on
all
fit
occasions
no
one
has
taken
the
statistics
of
the
number
of
times
every
small
child
is
exhorted
to
perfect
himself
in
this
particular
observance
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
in
the
united
states
alone
these
injunctions
are
spoken
something
like
a
million
times
a
day
and
all
quite
unnecessarily
the
child
will
say
please
and
thank
you
without
being
told
to
do
so
if
he
merely
has
his
attention
called
to
the
fact
that
the
people
around
him
all
use
these
phrases
sidenote
politeness
to
children
the
truth
is
too
many
parents
forget
to
speak
these
agreeable
words
whenever
they
ask
favors
of
their
own
children
so
the
force
of
their
example
is
marred
what
you
do
to
the
child
himself
remember
always
outweighs
anything
you
do
to
others
before
him
this
is
the
reason
why
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
acknowledge
your
own
shortcomings
to
the
child
if
you
expect
him
to
acknowledge
his
to
you
it
is
also
necessary
sometimes
to
point
out
clearly
the
kind
and
considerate
things
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
doing
to
others
lest
the
untrained
mind
of
the
young
child
may
fail
to
see
and
so
miss
the
force
of
your
example
but
in
thus
revealing
your
own
good
deeds
to
the
child
remember
the
motive
and
reveal
them
only
a
when
he
can
not
perceive
them
of
himself
b
when
he
needs
to
perceive
them
in
order
that
his
own
conduct
may
be
influenced
by
them
and
c
at
the
time
when
he
is
most
likely
to
appreciate
them
this
latter
requirement
precludes
you
from
announcing
your
own
righteousness
when
he
is
naughty
and
compels
you
of
course
to
go
directly
against
your
native
impulse
which
is
to
mention
your
deeds
of
sacrifice
and
kindness
only
when
you
are
angry
and
mean
to
reproach
him
with
them
when
you
tell
him
how
devoted
you
have
been
at
some
moment
when
you
are
both
thoroughly
angry
he
is
in
danger
of
either
denying
or
hating
your
devotion
but
when
you
refer
to
it
tenderly
and
as
your
heart
will
then
prompt
you
modestly
at
some
loving
moment
he
will
give
it
recognition
and
be
moved
to
love
goodness
more
devotedly
because
you
embody
it
sidenote
habit
another
important
rule
is
this
do
not
make
too
many
rules
some
women
are
like
legislatures
in
perpetual
session
the
child
who
is
confused
and
tantalized
by
the
constant
succession
of
new
laws
learns
presently
to
disregard
them
and
to
regulate
his
life
according
to
certain
deductions
of
his
own
sometimes
surprisingly
wise
and
politic
deductions
the
way
to
re
yourself
of
this
habit
is
to
stop
thinking
of
every
little
misdeed
as
the
beginning
of
a
great
wrong
it
is
very
likely
an
accident
and
a
combination
of
circumstances
such
as
may
not
happen
again
to
treat
misdemeanors
which
are
not
habitual
nor
characteristic
as
evanescent
is
the
best
way
to
make
them
evanescent
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
enter
too
deeply
into
your
consciousness
or
into
that
of
your
child
sidenote
live
with
your
children
in
order
to
be
able
to
discriminate
between
accidental
and
that
which
is
the
first
symptom
of
you
must
be
in
close
touch
with
your
children
this
brings
us
to
froebel
great
motto
come
let
us
live
with
our
children
this
means
that
you
are
not
merely
to
talk
with
your
child
to
hear
from
his
lips
what
he
is
doing
but
to
live
so
closely
with
him
that
in
most
cases
you
know
what
he
is
doing
without
any
need
of
his
telling
you
when
however
he
does
tell
you
something
which
happened
in
the
school
or
otherwise
out
of
the
range
of
your
knowledge
be
careful
not
to
moralize
over
it
make
yourself
as
agreeable
a
as
his
best
friend
of
his
own
age
let
your
moralizing
be
so
rare
that
it
is
effective
for
that
very
reason
if
the
occasion
needs
moral
reflection
at
all
and
that
seldom
happens
the
wise
way
is
to
lead
the
child
to
do
his
own
reflecting
to
arrive
at
his
own
conclusions
and
if
you
must
lead
him
by
all
means
do
so
as
invisibly
as
possible
for
the
most
part
it
is
safe
to
take
the
confessions
lightly
and
well
to
keep
your
own
mind
young
by
looking
at
things
from
the
boy
point
of
view
sidenote
the
subject
of
sex
if
however
there
is
to
be
perfect
confidence
between
you
the
one
subject
which
is
usually
kept
out
of
speech
between
mothers
and
children
must
be
no
forbidden
subject
between
them
you
must
not
refuse
to
answer
questions
about
the
mystery
of
sex
if
you
are
not
the
fit
person
to
teach
your
child
these
important
facts
who
is
certainly
not
the
and
servants
from
whom
he
is
likely
to
learn
them
if
you
refuse
to
furnish
the
information
usually
it
is
sufficient
simply
to
answer
the
child
honest
questions
honestly
but
any
mother
who
finds
herself
unable
to
cope
with
this
simple
matter
in
this
simple
spirit
will
find

in

b
in
respect
to
these
matters
more
than
in
respect
to
others
but
also
in
respect
to
all
matters
children
often
do
not
know
that
they
are
doing
wrong
even
when
it
it
very
difficult
for
parents
to
believe
that
they
do
not
intend
as
we
have
seen
from
our
analysis
of
truthfulness
the
child
may
very
often
lie
without
a
qualm
of
conscience
and
he
may
still
more
readily
break
the
unwritten
rules
of
courtesy
asking
abrupt
and
even
cruel
questions
of
strangers
and
haul
the
family
skeleton
out
of
its
closet
at
critical
moments
such
things
can
not
be
wholly
guarded
against
even
by
the
exercise
of
the
utmost
wisdom
but
the
habit
of
reasoning
things
out
for
himself
is
the
greatest
help
a
child
can
have
sidenote
righteousness
the
formation
of
the
bent
of
the
child
nature
as
a
whole
is
a
matter
of
unconscious
education
but
as
he
grows
in
the
power
to
reason
conscious
education
must
direct
his
mental
activity
it
is
not
enough
for
him
as
it
is
not
enough
for
any
grown
person
to
do
the
best
that
he
knows
he
must
learn
to
know
the
best
the
word
righteousness
itself
means
right
knowingness
to
quote
froebel
again
in
order
therefore
to
impart
true
genuine
firmness
to
the
natural
of
the
boy
all
the
activities
of
the
boy
his
entire
will
should
proceed
from
and
have
reference
to
the
development
cultivation
and
representation
of
the
internal
instruction
in
example
and
in
words
which
later
on
become
precept
and
example
furnishes
the
means
for
this
neither
example
alone
nor
words
will
do
not
example
alone
for
it
is
particular
and
special
and
the
word
is
needed
to
give
the
particular
individual
example
universal
applicability
not
words
alone
for
example
is
needed
to
interpret
and
explain
the
word
which
is
general
spiritual
and
of
many
meanings
but
instruction
and
example
alone
and
in
themselves
are
not
sufficient
they
must
meet
a
good
pure
heart
and
this
is
the
outcome
of
proper
educational
influences
in
childhood
sidenote
moral
precocity
lest
these
directions
should
seem
to
demand
an
almost
superhuman
degree
of
control
and
wisdom
on
the
part
of
the
mother
remember
that
moral
precocity
is
as
much
to
be
guarded
against
a
mental
precocity
remember
that
you
are
neither
required
to
be
a
perfect
mother
nor
to
rear
a
perfect
child

spencer
remarks
a
perfect
child
in
this
imperfect
world
would
be
sadly
out
of
joint
with
the
times
would
indeed
be
a
martyr
if
your
basic
principles
are
right
and
if
your
child
has
before
him
the
daily
and
hourly
spectacle
of
a
mother
who
is
trying
to
conform
herself
to
high
standards
he
will
grow
as
fast
as
it
is
safe
for
him
to
grow
spencer
says
our
higher
moral
faculties
like
our
higher
intellectual
ones
are
comparatively
complex
as
a
consequence
they
are
both
comparatively
late
in
their
evolution
and
with
the
one
as
with
the
other
a
very
early
activity
produced
by
stimulation
will
be
at
the
expense
of
the
future
character
hence
the
not
uncommon
fact
that
those
who
during
childhood
were
instanced
as
models
of
juvenile
goodness
by
and
by
undergo
some
disastrous
and
seemingly
inexplicable
change
and
end
by
being
not
above
but
below
par
while
relatively
exemplary
men
are
often
the
issue
of
a
childhood
not
so
promising
be
content
therefore
with
moderate
measures
and
moderate
results
constantly
bearing
in
mind
the
fact
that
the
higher
morality
like
the
higher
intelligence
must
be
reached
by
a
slow
growth
and
you
will
then
have
more
patience
with
those
imperfections
of
nature
which
your
child
hourly
displays
you
will
be
less
prone
to
constant
scolding
and
threatening
and
forbidding
by
which
many
parents
induce
a
chronic
irritation
in
a
foolish
hope
that
they
will

rules

the

that
the

to

known
as
the
educator
who
first
took
advantage
of
play
as
a
means
of
education
he
was
not
in
reality
the
first
to
recognize
the
high
value
of
this
spontaneous
activity
he
was
indeed
the
first
to
put
this
recognition
into
practice
and
to
use
the
force
generated
during
play
to
help
the
child
to
a
higher
state
of
knowledge
but
before
him
plato
said
that
the
plays
of
children
have
the
mightiest
influence
on
the
maintenance
or
the
of
laws
that
during
the
first
three
years
the
child
should
be
made
cheerful
and
kind
by
having
sorrow
and
fear
and
pain
kept
away
from
him
and
by
soothing
him
with
music
and
rhythmic
movements
sidenote
aristotle
aristotle
held
that
children
until
they
were
five
years
old
should
be
taught
nothing
not
even
necessary
labor
lest
it
hinder
growth
but
should
be
accustomed
to
use
much
motion
as
to
avoid
a
indolent
habit
of
body
and
this
he
added
can
he
acquired
by
various
means
among
others
by
play
which
ought
to
be
neither
illiberal
nor
laborious
or
lazy
sidenote
luther
luther
rebukes
those
who
despise
the
plays
of
children
and
says
that
solomon
did
not
prohibit
scholars
from
play
at
the
proper
time
fenelon
locke
schiller
and
richter
all
admit
the
deep
significance
of
this
universal
instinct
of
youth
preyer
speaking
not
as
a
philosopher
or
educator
but
as
a
scientist
mentions
the
new
kinds
of
pleasurable
sensations
with
some
admixture
of
intellectual
elements
which
are
gained
when
the
child
gradually
begins
to
play
much
that
is
called
play
he
considers
true
experimenting
especially
when
the
child
is
seen
to
be
studying
the
changes
produced
by
his
own
activity
as
when
he
tears
paper
into
small
bits
shakes
a
bunch
of
keys
opens
and
shuts
a
box
plays
with
sand
and
empties
bottles
and
throws
stones
into
the
water
the
zeal
with
which
these
seemingly
aimless
movements
are
executed
is
remarkable
the
sense
of
gratification
must
be
very
great
and
is
principally
due
to
the
feeling
of
his
own
power
and
of
being
the
cause
of
the
various
changes
sidenote
educational
value
of
play
all
these
authorities
are
quoted
here
in
order
to
show
that
the
practical
recognition
of
play
which
obtains
among
the
advanced
educators
is
not
a
piece
of
sentimentalism
as
stern
critics
sometimes
declare
but
the
united
opinion
of
some
of
the
wisest
minds
of
this
and
former
ages
as
froebel
says
play
and
speech
constitute
the
element
in
which
the
child
lives
at
this
stage
the
first
three
years
of
childhood
he
imparts
to
everything
the
virtues
of
sight
feeling
and
speech
he
feels
the
unity
between
himself
and
the
whole
external
world
and
froebel
conceives
it
to
be
of
the
profoundest
importance
that
this
sense
of
unity
should
not
be
disturbed
he
finds
that
play
is
the
most
spiritual
activity
of
man
at
this
age
and
at
the
same
time
typical
of
human
life
as
a
whole
of
the
inner
hidden
natural
life
of
man
and
all
things
it
gives
therefore
joy
freedom
contentment
inner
and
outer
rest
peace
with
the
world
it
holds
the
sources
of
all
that
is
good
the
child
that
plays
thoroughly
until
physical
fatigue
forbids
will
surely
be
a
thorough
determined
man
capable
of
for
the
promotion
and
welfare
of
himself
and
others
but
all
play
does
not
deserve
this
high
praise
it
fits
only
the
play
under
right
conditions
fortunately
these
are
such
that
every
mother
can
command
them
there
are
three
essentials
freedom
sympathy
right
materials
sidenote
freedom
freedom
is
the
first
essential
and
here
the
child
of
poverty
often
has
the
advantage
of
the
child
of
wealth
there
are
few
things
in
the
home
too
good
for
him
to
play
with
in
its
narrow
quarters
he
becomes
perforce
a
part
of
all
domestic
activity
he
learns
the
uses
of
household
utensils
and
his
play
merges
by
imperceptible
degrees
into
true
healthful
work
in
the
home
of
wealth
however
there
is
no
such
freedom
no
such
richness
of
opportunity
the
child
of
wealth
has
plenty
of
toys
but
few
real
things
to
play
with
he
is
shut
out
of
the
common
activity
of
the
family
and
shut
in
to
the
imitation
activity
of
his
nursery
he
never
gets
his
small
hands
on
realities
but
in
his
elegant
clothes
is
confined
to
the
narrow
conventional
round
that
is
falsely
supposed
to
be
good
for
him
froebel
insists
upon
the
importance
of
the
child
dress
being
loose
serviceable
and
inconspicuous
so
that
he
may
play
as
much
as
possible
without
consciousness
of
the
restrictions
of
dress
the
playing
child
should
also
have
as
we
have
noticed
in
the
first
section
the
freedom
of
the
outside
world
this
does
not
mean
merely
that
he
should
go
out
in
his
or
take
a
ride
in
the
park
but
that
he
should
be
able
to
play
to
creep
on
the
ground
to
be
a
little
savage
and
play
with
nature
as
he
finds
it
sidenote
sympathy
sympathy
is
much
more
likely
to
rise
spontaneously
in
the
breast
for
the
child
troubles
than
for
the
child
joys
she
will
stop
to
take
him
up
and
pet
him
when
he
is
hurt
no
matter
how
busy
she
is
but
she
too
often
considers
it
waste
of
time
to
enter
into
his
plays
with
him
yet
he
needs
sympathy
in
joy
as
much
as
in
sorrow
her
presence
her
interest
in
what
he
is
doing
doubles
his
delight
in
it
and
doubles
its
value
to
him
moreover
it
offers
her
opportunity
for
that
touch
and
direction
now
and
then
which
may
transform
a
rambling
play
without
much
sequence
or
meaning
into
a
consciously
useful
performance
a
dramatization
perhaps
of
some
of
the
observations
or
an
investigation
into
the
nature
of
things
right
material
even
given
freedom
and
sympathy
the
child
needs
something
more
in
order
to
play
well
he
needs
the
right
materials
the
best
materials
are
those
that
are
common
to
him
and
to
the
rest
of
the
world
far
better
than
expensive
toys
that
mark
him
apart
from
the
world
of
less
fortunate
children
such
toys
are
not
in
any
way
desirable
and
they
may
even
be
harmful
what
he
needs
are
various
simple
arrangements
of
the
four
elements
earth
air
fire
and
water
sidenote
the
child
has
a
noted
affinity
for
it
and
he
is
specially
happy
when
he
has
plenty
of
it

there
are
those
who
say
that
no

he
has
had
a
garden
of
his
own
and
grown
in
it
all
sorts
of
seeds
from
pansies
to
potatoes
but
a
garden
is
too
much
for
a
young
child
to
care
for
all
alone
he
needs
the
help
advice
and
companionship
of
some
older
person
you
must
be
careful
however
to
give
help
only
when
it
is
really
desired
and
careful
also
not
to
let
him
feel
that
the
garden
is
a
task
to
which
he
is
driven
daily

a
joy
that
draws
him
sidenote
kites

their
great
advantages

that

by
giving
the

the
very
first
thing
he
learns
to
play
with
is
water
almost
before
he
knows
the
use
of
his
hands
and
legs
he
plays
with
water
in
his
bath
and
sucks
his
sponge
with
joy
thus
feeling
the
water
with
his
chief
organs
of
touch

him
down
before

may
be
added

given
all
at

the
child
allowed
to
exhaust
the
possibilities
of
each

another
is
added
still

he
may
be
given
the
bits
of

dangerous
pastimes
some
of
those
pastimes
are
dangerous

they
are
sure
to
be
indulged
in
at
some
time
or
other
with
or
without
permission
there

mother
then
will
not
forbid
this
play
but
will
do
her
best
to
regulate
it
to
make

will
think
out
plans
for
permitting
children
to
go
swimming
in
a
safe
place
with
some
older

she
will
let
them
go
wading
and
at
holiday
time
will
take
them
if
she
permits
as
much
activity
in
these
respects
as
possible
her
refusal
when
it
does
come
will
be
respected
and
the
child
will
not
unless
perhaps
in
the
first
bitterness
of
disappointment
think
her
unfriendly
and
fussy
above
all
he
is
not
likely
to
try
to
deceive
her
to
run
off
and
take
a

thus
fall
into

danger

another
inevitable
plaything

reports
that
the
first
act
of
her
little
niece
that
showed
the
dawn
of
voluntary
control
of
the
muscles
was
the
clinging
of
her
eyes
to
the
flame
of
a
candle
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
the
sense
of
light
and
the
pleasure
derived
from
it
is
of
the
chief
incentives
to
a
intellectual
development
but
since
fire
is
dangerous
the
child
must
be
taught
this
fact
as
quickly
and
painlessly
as
possible
he
will
probably
have
to
be
burned
once
before
he
really
understands
it
but
by
watching
you
can
make
this
pain
very
small
and
slight
barely
sufficient
to
give
the
child
a
wholesome
fear
of
playing
with
unguarded
fire
for
instance
show
that
the
lamp
globe
is
hot
it
is
not
hot
enough
to
injure
him
but
quite
hot
enough
to
be
unpleasant
to
his
sensitive
nerves
put
your
own
hand
on
the
lamp
and
draw
it
away
with
a
sharp
cry
saying
warningly
hot
hot
do
not
put
his
hand
on
the
lamp
but
let
him
put
it
there
himself
and
then
be
very
sympathetic
over
the
result
usually
one
such
lesson
is
sufficient
only
do
not
permit
yourself
to
call
everything
hot
which
you
do
not
want
him
to
touch

will
soon
discover
that
you
are
untruthful

the
rule
should
be
that

that

bringing

control
at

of

must
guess
what
it
is
and
then
act
out
their
guess
in
pantomime
so
that
she
can
see
what
they
mean
perhaps
it
is
a
windmill
song

fly
around

around

the
music
now
fast
now

perhaps
it
is
a

children
are
birds

into

of
the
greatest

educational
advantage
in

the

expresses
his

becomes
master
of
his
own

he
acts
out

he
is

there
is
a

all

ought
to
have
a

because
of
the

they

at

most
of
them
are
exactly
the
toys
that
parents
usually
buy
but
it
will
be
noticed
that
none
of
them
are
very
elaborate
or
expensive
and
that
the
patrol

is
not
among
them
this
is
because
the
patrol
wagon
directly
leads
to
plays
that
are
not
only
uneducational
but
positively
harmful
in
their
tendencies
the
children
of
a
whole
neighborhood
were
once
led
into

there
are
a
number
of
books
designed
to
teach
mothers
how
to
carry
the
kindergarten
occupations
over
into
the
home
but
while
such
books
may
be
helpful
in
a
few
cases
in
most
cases
better
occupations
present
themselves
in
the
course
of
the
day
work
the
kindergarten
occupations
themselves
follow
increasingly
the
order
of
domestic
routine
for
example
many
children
in
the
kindergarten
make
mittens
out
of
eiderdown
flannel
in
the
fall
when
their
own
mothers
are
knitting
their
mittens
and
make
little
hoods
either
for
themselves
or
for
their
dolls
at
other
periods
they
put
up
little
glasses
of
preserves
or
jelly
and
study
the
industry
of
the
bees
and
the
way
they
put
up
their
tiny
jars
of
jelly
their
attention
is
called
also
to
the
preparations
that
the
squirrels
and
other
animals
make
for
winter
and
to
that
of
the
trees
and
flowers
in
other
words
the
occupations
in
the
kindergarten
are
designed
to
bring
the
children
into
conscious
sympathy
with
the
life
of
nature
and
of
the
home
sidenote
kindergarten
methods
that
mother
who
keeps
this
purpose
in
mind
and
applies
it
to
the
occupations
that
come
up
naturally
in
the
course
of
a
day
work
will
thereby
bring
the
kindergarten
spirit
into
her
own
home
much
more
truly
than
if
she
invests
in
a
number
of
perforated
sewing
cards
and
colored
strips
of
paper
for
weaving
not
that
there
is
any
harm
in
these
bits
of
apparatus
provided
that
the
sewing
cards
are
large
and
so
perforated
as
not
to
task
the
eyes
and
young
fingers
of
the
sewer
but
unless
for
some
special
purpose
such
as
the
making
of
a
christmas
or
birthday
gift
these
devices
are
unnecessary
and
better
left
to
the
school
which
has
less
richness
of
material
at
hand
than
has
the
home
sidenote
helping
mother
in
allowing
the
children
to
enter
a
workers
into
the
full
life
of
the
home
several
good
things
are
accomplished
the
eager
interest
of
the
developing
mind
is
utilized
to
brighten
those
duties
which
are
likely
to
remain
permanent
duties
not
does
this
observation
apply
only
to
girls
domestic
obligations
are
supposed
to
rest
chiefly
upon
them
but
the
truth
is
that
boys
need
to
feel
these
obligations
as
keenly
as
the
girls
if
they
are
to
grow
into
considerate
and
helpful
husbands
and
fathers
the
usual
division
of
labor
into
forms
falsely
called
masculine
and
feminine
is
therefore
much
to
be
deplored
moreover
at
an
early
age
children
are
seldom
and
any
precocity
in
this
direction
is
especially
evil
in
its
results
yet
many
mothers
from
the
beginning
make
such
a
division
between
what
they
require
of
their
boys
and
of
their
girls
as
to
force
this
consciousness
upon
them
all
kinds
of
work
then
should
be
allowed
in
the
beginning
however
it
may
differentiate
later
on
and
little
boys
as
well
as
little
girls
should
be
taught
to
take
an
interest
in
sewing
sweeping
dusting
and
cooking
in
all
the
forms
of
domestic
activity
this
is
so
far
recognized
among
educators
that
the
most
progressive
primary
schools
now
teach
cooking
to
mixed
classes
of
boys
and
girls
and
also
sewing
these
activities
are
recognized
as
highly
educational
being
as
they
are
interwoven
with
the
history
of
the
race
and
with
its
daily
needs
when
they
are
studied
in
their
full
sum
of
relationship
they
increase
the
child
knowledge
of
both
the
past
and
the
living
world
sidenote
teaching
mother
besides
the
deepening
of
the
child
interest
in
that
work
which
in
some
form
or
other
he
will
have
with
him
always
is
the
quickening
of
the
mother
own
interest
in
what
may
have
come
to
seem
to
her
mere
daily
drudgery
any
woman
who
undertakes
to
perform
so
simple
an
operation
as
with
the
help
of
a
bright
happy
child
asking
sixteen
questions
to
the
minute
will
find
that
operation
full
of
possibilities
and
if
she
will
answer
all
the
questions
she
will
probably
find
her
knowledge
strained
to
the
breaking
point
and
will
discover
there
is
more
to
be
known
about
than
she
ever
dreamed
of
before
while
in
cooking
if
she
will
make
an
effort
to
look
up
the
science
history
and
ethics
involved
in
the
cooking
and
serving
of
a
very
simple
meal
she
will
not
be
likely
to
regard
the
task
as
one
beneath
her
but
rather
as
one
beyond
her
no
one
can
so
lead
her
away
from
false
conventions
and
narrow
prejudices
as
a
little
child
whom
she
permits
to
help
her
and
teach
her
sidenote
the
love
of
work
the
child
spontaneous
joy
in
being
active
and
in
doing
any
service
is
being
utilized
as
it
should
be
in
the
performance
of
his
daily
duties
we
have
already
referred
to
the
fact
that
all
children
in
the
beginning
love
to
work
and
that
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
our
education
since
this
love
is
so
early
lost
and
so
seldom
reacquired
if
when
young
children
wish
to
help
mother
they
are
almost
invariably
permitted
to
do
so
and
their
efforts
greeted
lovingly
this
delight
in
helpfulness
will
remain
a
blessing
to
them
throughout
life
sidenote
to
make
helping
of
benefit
but
in
order
to
get
these
benefits
from
the
domestic
activities
two
or
three
simple
rules
must
be
observed
do
not
go
silently
about
your
work
expecting
your
child
to
be
interested
and
to
understand
without
being
talked
to
play
with
him
while
you
work
with
him
and
see
the
realization
of
youthfulness
that
comes
to
yourself
while
you
do
it
many
tasks
fit
for
childish
hands
are
in
their
nature
too
monotonous
for
childish
minds
here
your
imagination
must
come
into
play
to
rouse
and
excite
his
activity
for
instance
you
are
both
shelling
peas
when
he
begins
to
be
tired
you
suggest
to
him
here
is
a
cage
full
of
birds
let
us
open
the
door
for
them
or
you
may
tell
a
story
while
you
work
but
it
should
be
a
story
about
that
very
activity
or
the
child
will
form
the
habit
of
dreaming
and
dawdling
over
his
work
such
stories
may
be
perfectly
simple
and
even
rather
pointless
and
yet
do
good
work
the
whole
object
is
to
keep
the
child
imagination
turned
upon
the
work
at
hand
thus
lending
wings
to
his
thought
and
lightness
to
his
fingers
moreover
the
mother
who
talks
with
her
child
while
working
is
training
in
him
the
habit
of
bright
unconscious
conversation
thus
giving
him
a
most
useful
accomplishment
making
a
game
or
a
play
out
of
the
work
is
of
course
conducive
to
the
same
good
results
when
the
story
or
the
talk
drags
the
game
with
its
greater
dramatic
power
may
be
substituted
sidenote
fatigue
children
should
neither
be
allowed
to
work
to
the
point
of
fatigue
nor
to
stop
when
they
please
fatigue
as
our
latest
investigators
in
physiological
psychology
have
conclusively
proved
is
productive
of
an
actual
poison
in
the
blood
and
as
such
is
peculiarly
harmful
to
young
children
but
while
work
or
for
that
matter
play
either
must
never
be
pushed
past
the
point
of
healthful
fatigue
it
may
well
be
pushed
past
the
point
of
spontaneous
interest
and
desire
the
child
may
be
happily
persuaded
by
various
hidden
means
to
do
a
little
more
than
he
is
quite
ready
to
do
by
this
device
which
is
one
of
the
recognized
devices
of
the
kindergarten
mothers
increase
by
imperceptible
degrees
that
power
of
attention
which
makes
will
power
sidenote
willing
industry
set
the
example
of
willing
industry
neither
let
the
child
conceive
of
you
as
an
impersonal
necessary
part
of
the
household
machinery
nor
as
an
unwilling
martyr
to
household
necessities
most
mothers
err
in
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
directions
and
many
of
them
err
in
both
they
either
a
perform
the
innumerable
services
of
the
household
so
quietly
and
steadily
that
the
child
does
not
perceive
the
effort
that
the
performance
costs
and
therefore
as
far
as
his
consciousness
is
concerned
is
deprived
of
the
force
of
his
example
or
b
they
groan
aloud
over
their
burdens
and
make
their
daily
martyrdom
vocal
either
way
is
wrong
for
it
is
a
mistake
not
to
let
a
child
see
that
your
steady
performance
of
tasks
which
can
not
be
always
delightful
is
a
result
of
and
it
is
equally
a
mistake
to
let
him
think
that
this
discipline
is
one
against
which
you
rebel
for
in
reality
you
are
so
far
from
being
unwilling
to
bind
yourself
in
his
service
that
if
he
needed
it
you
would
promptly
double
and
quadruple
your
exertions
it
is
exactly
what
you
do
when
he
is
sick
or
in
danger
and
if
he
dies
the
sorest
ache
of
your
heart
is
the
ache
of
the
love
that
can
no
longer
be
of
service
to
the
beloved
sidenote
monotony
remember
that
monotony
is
the
curse
of
labor
for
both
child
and
adult
but
that
can
not
exist
where
new
intellectual
insights
are
constantly
being
therefore
while
the
daily
round
of
labor
shaped
by
the
daily
recurring
demands
for
food
warmth
cleanliness
and
sleep
goes
on
without
much
change
seize
every
opportunity
to
deepen
the
child
perception
of
the
relation
of
this
routine
to
the
order
of
the
larger
world
for
instance
if
a
new
house
is
being
built
near
by
visit
it
with
the
children
comparing
it
with
your
own
house
figure
out
whether
it
is
going
to
be
easier
to
keep
clean
and
to
warm
than
your
house
is
and
why
if
you
need
to
call
in
the
carpenter
the
plumber
the
or
the
stoveman
try
to
have
him
come
when
the
children
are
at
home
and
let
them
satisfy
their
intense
curiosity
as
to
his
work
this
knowledge
will
sooner
or
later
be
of
practical
value
and
it
is
immediately
of
spiritual
value
sidenote
beautiful
work
beautify
the
work
as
much
as
possible
by
letting
the
artistic
sense
have
full
play
this
rule
is
so
important
that
the
attempt
to
establish
it
in
the
larger
world
outside
of
the
home
has
given
rise
to
the
movement
known
as
the
arts
and
crafts
movement
which
has
its
rise
in
the
perception
that
no
great
art
can
come
into
existence
among
us
until
the
common
things
of
daily
living
the
furniture
the
books
the
carpets
the
chinaware
are
made
to
express
that
creative
joy
in
the
maker
which
distinguishes
an
artistic
product
from
an
inartistic
one
this
creative
joy
in
howsoever
small
degree
may
be
present
in
most
of
the
things
that
the
child
does
if
he
sets
the
table
he
may
set
it
beautifully
taking
real
pleasure
in
the
coloring
of
the
china
and
the
shine
of
the
silver
and
glass
he
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
set
it
untidily
upon
a
soiled
tablecloth
sidenote
the
right
spirit
this
is
a
negative
rule
but
perhaps
the
most
important
of
all
do
not
nag
the
child
who
is
driven
to
his
work
and
kept
at
it
by
means
of
a
constant
pressure
of
a
stronger
will
upon
his
own
is
deriving
little
if
any
benefit
from
it
and
as
you
are
not
teaching
him
to
work
for
the
sake
of
his
present
usefulness
which
is
small
at
the
best
but
for
the
sake
of
his
future
development
you
are
more
desirous
that
he
should
perform
a
single
task
in
a
day
in
the
right
spirit
than
that
he
should
run
a
dozen
errands
in
the
wrong
spirit
besides
a
regular
time
each
day
for
the
performance
of
his
set
share
in
the
household
work
give
him
warning
before
the
arrival
of
that
hour
children
have
very
incomplete
notions
of
time
they
become
much
absorbed
in
their
own
play
and
therefore
no
child
under
nine
or
ten
years
of
age
should
be
expected
to
do
a
given
thing
at
a
given
time
without
warning
that
the
time
is
at
hand
sidenote
busy
work
besides
these
occupations
which
are
truly
part
of
the
business
of
life
come
any
number
of
other
occupations
a
sort
of
a
cross
between
real
play
and
steady
work
what
teachers
call
busy
work
and
here
the
suggestions
of
the
kindergarten
may
be
of
practical
value
to
the
mother
for
instance
weaving
already
referred
to

whatever
he

to
some

not

while
it
is
true
that
a
conscientious

to
live
up
to
this
rule
often
results
in
a
considerable
clutter
of
flimsy
and
rather
undesirable

sewing
sewing
is
another
occupation
ranch
used
in
the
kindergarten
as
well
as
in
the
home
beginning
with
the
simple
stringing
of
large
wooden
beads
upon
it
passes
on
to
sewing
on
buttons
and
sewing
doll
clothes
to
the
making
of
real
clothing
this
last
in
its
simplest
form
can
be
begun
sooner
than
most
parents
suppose
especially
if
the
child
is
taught
the
use
of
the
sewing
machine
there
is
really
no
reason
why
a
child
say
six
years
old
should
not
learn
to
sew
upon
the
machine
his
interest
in
machinery
is
keen
at
this
period
and
two
or
three
lessons
are
usually
sufficient
to
teach
him
enough
about
the
mechanism
to
keep
him
from
injuring
it
once
he
has
learned
to
sew
upon
the
machine
he
may
be
given
sheets
and
towels
to
hem
and
even
sew
up
the
seams
of
larger
and
more
complex
articles
he
will
soon
be
able
to
make
aprons
for
himself

his

toy
sewing
machines
are
now
sold
which
are
really
useful
playthings
and
on
which
the
child
can
manufacture
a
number
of
small
articles
those
run
by
a
treadle
are
preferable
to
those
run
by
a

they
leave
the

cutting

are
excellent
occupations
for
children
a
large

a
useful
addition
to
the
nursery
furnishings
but
the
children
should
be
required
to
wash
it
off
with
a
damp
cloth
instead
of
using
the
eraser
furnished
for
the
purpose
as
the

fills
the

lungs
plenty
of
soft

and

also
large

should
be
at
hand
upon

so
that
they
can
draw
the

which
best
develop
their
skill
whenever
the

moves
them
if
they
have
also
blunt

for
cutting

of

they
will
be

are
now
made

are
harmless
for

they
are

put

paints
are
on
the
whole
less
objectionable
than

the

art
and
literature
in
child
life
the
influence
of
art
upon
the
life
of
a
young
child
is
difficult
of
measurement
it
may
freely
be
said
however
that
there
is
little
or
no
danger
in
exaggerating
its
influence
and
considerable
danger
in
underrating
it
it
is
difficult
of
measurement
because
the
influence
is
largely
an
unconscious
one
indeed
it
may
be
questioned
whether
that
form
of
art
which
gives
him
the
most
conscious
and
outspoken
pleasure
is
the
form
that
in
reality
is
the
most
beneficial
for
unquestionably
he
will
get
great
satisfaction
from
circus
posters
and
the
poorly
printed
abominably
illustrated
cheap
afford
him
undeniable
joy
he
is
far
less
likely
to
be
expressive
of
his
pleasure
in
a
nursery
whose
walls
rugs
white
beds
and
windows
are
all
well
designed
and
well
adapted
to
his
needs
nevertheless
in
the
end
the
influence
of
this
room
is
likely
to
be
the
greater
influence
and
to
permanently
shape
his
ideas
of
the
beautiful
while
he
is
entirely
certain
if
allowed
to
develop
artistically
at
all
to
grow
past
the
circus
poster
period
this
fact
the
fact
that
the
highest
influence
of
art
is
a
secret
influence
exercised
not
only
by
those
decorations
and
pictures
which
flaunt
themselves
for
the
purpose
but
also
by
those
quiet
necessary
things
which
nevertheless
may
most
truly
express
the
art
spirit
this
fact
makes
it
difficult
to
tell
what
art
and
what
kind
of
art
is
really
influencing
the
child
and
whether
it
is
influencing
him
in
the
right
directions
sidenote
color
until
he
is
three
years
old
for
example
and
often
until
he
is
past
that
age
he
is
unable
to
distinguish
clearly
between
green
gray
and
blue
and
hence
these
cool
colors
in
the
decorations
around
him
or
in
his
pictures
have
practically
no
meaning
for
him
he
has
a
right
one
might
suppose
to
the
gratification
of
his
love
for
clear
reds
and
yellows
for
the
sharp
lines
and
flat
surfaces
whose
meaning
is
plain
to
his
groping
little
mind
some
of
the
best
illustrators
of
children
books
have
seemed
to
recognize
this
for
example
boutet
de
monvil
in
his
admirable
illustrations
of
joan
of
arc
meets
these
requirements
perfectly
and
yet
in
a
manner
which
must
satisfy
any
adult
lover
of
good
art
the
caldecott
picture
books
and
walter
crane
are
also
good
in
this
respect
and
the
perkins
pictures
issued
by
the
prang
educational
have
gained
a
just
recognition
as
excellent
pictures
for
hanging
on
the
nursery
wall
many
of
the
illustrations
in
color
in
the
standard
magazines
are
well
worth

is
especially
true

since
photogravures

inexpensively
there
is
no
reason
why
children
should
not
be
made
acquainted
at
an
early
age
with
the
art
classics
but
there
is
danger
in
giving
too
much
space
to
black
and
white
especially
in
the
nursery
where
the
children
live
their
natural
love
of

should
be
appealed
to
do
deepen
their
interest

can
see
the

in

its
expensiveness

this
reason
as
well
as
perhaps
because
of
a
remnant

love

among

not

that

immediate

like
to
dress
up
to

persons
about

even
throws
the

itself
into

this
does
not
mean
however
that
all

should
be
permitted
to
go
to
the

as
freely
as
they
like
no

they
compose

a

higher
value

than

of
the
old
fairy
tales
with
which
they
are
usually
regaled
and
certainly
more
than
the
sensational
melodramas
which
give
them
false
ideas
of
art
and
morality
they
should
go
sometimes
to
the
theater
to
see
really
good
and
simple
plays
but
they
should
be
oftener
encouraged
to
get
up
for
themselves

as
they
grow
older
they
are
helped
to
think
out

something
of

by

so
intimately
links

with
his

it
is
for
this
reason
that

is
equipped
with
small

in
which
the

will
direct
this
spontaneous
affection
into

love

writer
of
tells
the
truth
using
the
pigments
of

imagination
if
children
ask
whether
a
given
story
is
true
or
not
answer
without
hesitation
yes
it
is
true
but
it
is
a
fairy
kind
of
truth
it
is
inside
truth
there
is
magic
in
it
and
a
mystery
the
child
who
is
never
allowed
to
read
fairy
tales
the
man
or
the
woman
who
prefers
the

misses
much
in

it
is
not

the
divinest
quality
of
man
because
the
quality
that
makes
man
in
his
degree
a
creator
does
not
receive
culture
and
that
he
misses
the
indescribable
intellectual
ecstasy
that
comes
only
with
the
setting
free
of
the
wings
of
the
mind
but
that
also
he
is
inevitably
shorn
of
his
sympathy
and
shut
up
to
a
narrow
circle
of
interests
sidenote
imagination
and
sympathy
for
sympathy
above
all
moral
qualities
is
dependent
upon
imagination
if
you
can
not
imagine
how
you
would
feel
under
your
neighbor
conditions
you
can
not
deeply
sympathize
with
him
the
person
of
unimaginative

only
with
those
whose
experience
and
habits
are
similar
to
his
own
he
never
escapes
from
the
narrow
circle
of
his
own
personality
but
the
man
whose
imagination
has
been
kept
flexible
and
ready
from
earliest
childhood
has
within
him
the
power
of
sympathizing
with
whatever
is
human
yes
even
with
creatures
and
things
below
the
human
level
without
imagination
therefore
it
is
not
possible
for
a
man
to
be
a
great
scientist
for
science
demands
sympathy
with
processes
and
objects
which
are
not
yet
human
it
is
not
possible
obviously
for
him
to
be
a
great
artist
of
any
kind
for
all
art
is
interpretation
of
the
world
by
means
of
the
imagination
it
is
not
possible
for
him
even
to
be
a
good
man
in
any
broad
sense
for
the
man
whose
sympathies
are
narrow
is
often
found
to
be
guilty
of
injustice
toward
those
who
lie
outside
the
pale
of
those

by
all

then
encourage
the
love
of
reading
in
your

and
get
them
the
best

to
the

with

let
some

generally
speaking
the
best
are
those
that
have
some

in

many
of

now
being
so
widely

in

are

versions
of
these

which
helped
to
make

it

there
are
two

finally
all
appreciation
of
literature

depends
upon
a
love

some
knowledge
of
nature
fairy

and
mythology
especially
are
so
dependent

for
their
inner
meaning
and
significance
as
scarcely
to
be
intelligible
without
some
knowledge
of
natural
processes
and
laws
of
course
it
is
true
that
art
in
its
turn
idealizes
nature
and
fills
her
beautiful
form
with
a
beautiful
soul
so
that
the
child
who
is
being
developed
on
all
sides
needs
to
take
his
books

his

out

under

all
these
arts
describe
and
interpret
if
he
should
be
so
unhappy
as
to
have
to
choose
between
nature
and
art
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
choose
nature
because
then
perhaps
art
might
be
born
in
his
own
soul
but
there
is
happily
no
need
for
such
a
painful
choice
he
can
sing
his
little
song
out
of

social

is
as

failure
to
recognize
this
truth
is
at

of

current
misconceptions
of

are
still

at

to

when

by

no

however

can

what
the
kindergarten
supplies
for

is
necessarily

on

set
that
in

such

the

is
accustomed
to

if
the

acceded
to
this
demand
as
it
seldom
does
it
would
lose
much
of
its

not
be
permanently
sheltered

which
are

is
to

for
the
organ
that
is
to
receive
it

the
brain
like
the

a
signal
which
it

not
the
brain
exhibits
interest
exactly
as
the

the
object
of
scientific
education
is
to
discover
what
the
spontaneous
universal
interest
of
children
of
certain
ages
is
and
to
meet
that
interest
with
the
fullest
possible
supply
of
knowledge
in
every
conceivable
form
scientific
education
does
not
depend
upon
or
upon
merely
verbal
explanations
but
gets
the
idea
home
to
the
child
by
the
means
of
a
varied
appeal
to
all
the
senses
and
sensibilities
for
this
reason
the
most
advanced
schools
have
many
more
studies
and
what
are
commonly
called
accomplishments
than
the
public
or
parochial
schools
that
is
they
add
to
the
three

and

modeling
painting

and

sidenote
correlation
of

yet
this
apparently
great
increase
of
subjects
in
the
number
of
studies
actually
lessens
the
amount
of
work
required
of
the
child
because
all
these
different
activities
by
means
of
what
is
called
correlation
are
brought
to
bear
upon
the
same
subject
for
example
the
class
which
goes
out
for
a
field
trip
to
visit
a
brook
sees
the
water
actually
at
work
cutting
its
way
to
the
river
and
thence
to
the
sea
they
measure
its
force
and
note
its
effects
they
make
a
sketch
of
some
curve
of
it
they
notice
what
birds
and
insects
are
about
what
flowers
grow
there
what
indications
there
may
be
of
burrowing
animals
when
they
get
back
to
school
they
model
perhaps
some
bird
that
they
have
noticed
or
in
the
geographical
laboratory
with
streams
of
water
try
to
reproduce
in
miniature
the
action
of
the
brook
upon
the
soil
through
which
it
flows
for
their
arithmetic
lesson
they
estimate
the
number
of
years
the
brook
must
have
been
flowing
to
have
cut
its
valley
to
its
present
depth
they
make
a
full
report
and
description
of
their
day
work
for
their
reading
and
writing
lesson
they
have
thus
gained
an
immense
amount
of
information
and
have
done
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
but
instead
of
being
nervously
exhausted
they
are
bright
and
exhilarated

fatigue
as
they
know
is
wholesome
and
fits
them
for

the
ordinary
school
by
some
of

the

with

to
model

which
he
studies
at

he
will
instantly
show
the

of
the

and
encouragement
as
for
field

may
be

to
take
its

that
you
do
not

to

on

him
then
the

of
teaching
you
he
will
work

harder
in

your

in

be
a

is

thereby
showy
things
that
children
do
for
the
edification
of
guests
are
of
doubtful
value
it
is
pleasant
of
course
to
have
your
little
girl
play
a
piece
or
two
on
the
piano
to
entertain
your
visitors
but
it
is
not
nearly
so
important
as
health
and
strength
and
a
cheerful
temper
sometimes
all
three
of
these
are
sacrificed
to
the
two
or
three
hours
practice
a
day
often
too
this
extra
work
after
school
hours
work
full
as
monotonous
and
nervous
and
uninteresting
as
the
school
work
itself
is
just
what
is
needed
to
transform
a
healthy
young
girl
into
a
nervous
invalid
this
is
especially
true
if
she
undertakes
as
she
usually
does
to
study
music
when
she
is
about
thirteen
years
old
the
very
time
when
if
wise
physicians
could
regulate
affairs
to
their
liking
she
would
be
taken
out
of
school
altogether
and
required
to
do
nothing
more
than
a
little
light
housework
every
day
sidenote
natural
talent
of
course
if
she
is
naturally
musical
some
kind
of
help
and
sympathy
must
be
given
her
in
her
attempt
to
master
the
piano
or
violin
or
to
manage
her
own
voice
but
while
she
should
be
allowed
to
learn
as
much
as
her
unurged
energies
permit
her
to
learn
she
should
not
be
required
to
practice
more
than
a
very
small
amount
say
half
an
hour
a
day
the
bulk
of
her
musical
education
should
be
acquired
in
the
vacation
time
when
she
can
give
two
hours
a
day
without
overstraining
the
same
general
rules
hold
good
of
dancing
painting
the
acquirements
of
foreign
languages
a
special
course
of
reading
or
any
other
work
undertaken
in
addition
to
the
regular
school
work
this
latter
as
it
is
now
constituted
is
quite
as
severe
a
nervous
and
intellectual
strain
as
most
young
people
can
undergo
with
safety
sidenote
enthusiasms
there
is
one
characteristic
in
young
people
which
needs
to
be
noted
in
this
connection
the
desire
to
take
up
some
form
of
work
to
strive
with
it
furiously
for
a
brief
while
to
drop
it
unfinished
take
up
another
with
equal
eagerness
drop
that
in
turn
and
go
on
to
a
third
this
performance
is
peculiarly
irritating
to
all
systematic
and
ambitious
parents
sometimes
they
rigidly
insist
that
each
task
shall
be
finished
before
a
new
one
is
assumed
but
in
reality
is
this
necessary
it
seems
to
be
as
natural
for
a
young
mind
to
set
eagerly
to
work
for
a
short
time
at
each
new
bit
of
knowledge
as
it
is
for
a
nursing
child
to
require
refreshments
every
two
or
three
hours
it
is
an
adult
trait
to
stick
to
a
task
even
though
a
very
long
one
until
it
is
accomplished
the
youthful
trait
is
to
take
kindly
to
a
clutter
of
unfinished
tasks
the
youthful
consciousness
is
of
a
world
full
of
jostling
interests
why
not
let
the
children
alone
and
allow
them
to
spring
lightly
from
one
enthusiasm
to
another
of
course
you
will
help
them
to
finish
either
at
the
first
sitting
or
at
the
second
or
at
the
third
the
task
that
was
undertaken
when
that
particular
enthusiasm
was
at
its
height
the
drawing
which
has
remained
on
the
easel
during
the
season
may
be
suggestively
brought
to
notice
again
in
the
quiet
times
between
thanksgiving
and
christmas
the
boat
begun
last
summer
may
well
be
finished
in
the
days
of
the
succeeding
spring
when
all
the
earth
is
full
of
the
sound
of
running
water
thus
each
task
though
not
completed
at
once
gets
done
in
the
end
and
the
youthful
capacity
for
many
sympathies
and
many
desires
has
not
been
narrowed
sidenote
parental
vanity
such
a
line
of
conduct
presupposes
of
course
that
the
parent
considers
only
the
child
best
welfare
and
not
his
own
parental
vanity
he
is
not
desirous
that
his
son
shall
do
anything
so
well
as
to
attract
the
attention
and
admiration
of
the
neighbors
he
is
desirous
merely
that
the
boy
shall
grow
up
wholesomely
and
happily
showing
such
superiority
as
there
may
be
in
him
when
the
fitting
time
and
opportunity
present
themselves
he
will
not
attempt
to
make
a
musician
of
an
unmusical
child
nor
a
mechanic
of
an
artistic
child
he
will
not
object
to
the
brilliant
and
impractical
dreams
of
the
young
inventor
but
will
help
to
make
them
practicable
and
though
he
may
squirm
at
some
of
the
investigations
of
the
budding
scientist
he
will
not
forbid
them
sidenote
development
of
intellect
for
such
a
parent
recognizes
that
the
important
thing
educationally
is
to
secure
the
reaction
of
expression
upon
thought
and
feeling
that
is
he
is
not
trying
to
secure
at
this
time
at
any
time
during
youth
perfect
expression
of
any
thought
or
feeling
but
only
to
deepen
feeling
and
clarify
thought
by
encouraging
all
attempts
at
expression
he
does
not
wish
his
child
to
make
a
finished
picture
or
a
perfect
statue
but
to
acquire
a
greater
sensitiveness
to
color
and
form
by
each
attempt
to
express
that
color
and
form
which
he
already
knows
thus
whatever
studies
and
accomplishments
his
child
may
be
in
the
act
of
acquiring
are
seen
to
be
nothing
as
acquisitions
but
the
child
himself
is
seen
to
be
growing
stage
by
stage
within
the
clumsy
scaffolding
financial
training
the
financial
training
of
children
ought
really
to
be
considered
under
the
head
of
moral
training
but
in
some
respects
it
can
come
equally
well
under
the
head
of
intellectual
training
for
to
spend
money
well
requires
both
and
intelligence
some
persons
seem
to
think
that
all
that
a
child
can
be
taught
in
this
regard
is
to
save
money
and
they
meet
the
situation
by
purchasing
various
shapes
and
styles
of
savings
banks
but
it
is
entirely
possible
to
teach
the
child
too
thoroughly
in
this
respect
and
to
make
him
so
fond
of
his
jingling
pennies
safe
within
a
yellow
crockery
pig
or
iron
cupolaed
mansion
that
be
will
not
spend
them
for
any
object
however
laudable
others
evade
the
issue
as
long
as
possible
by
giving
the
child
no
money
at
all
while
most
of
us
pursue
an
uncertain
and
wabbly
course
sometimes
giving
money
sometimes
withholding
it
sometimes
exhorting
the
child
to
spend
and
sometimes
to
save
sidenote
regular
allowance
in
truth
spending
wisely
is
a
difficult
problem
as
a
rule
the
child
may
safely
be
induced
to
lay
by
for
a
season
and
then
encouraged
to
spend
for
some
generous
purpose
christmas
and
other
festivals
offer
excellent
opportunities
for
proper
disbursement
of
the
hoarded
funds
these
may
be
supposed
to
have
accumulated
from
irregular
gifts
but
as
the
child
grows
older
he
should
come
into
receipt
of
a
regular
definite
allowance
perhaps
conditioned
upon
his
performance
of
some
stated
duty
a
certain
part
of
his
allowance
he
may
he
permitted
to
spend
upon
such
frivolities
as
are
naturally
dear
to
his
young
heart
another
part
of
it
he
should
be
encouraged
not
commanded
to
put
aside
for
larger
purposes
the
giving
of
this
allowance
must
not
be
confused
with
the
pernicious
habit
of
bribing
the
child
to
the
performance
of
those
little
daily
courtesies
and
duties
which
he
ought
to
be
willing
to
perform
out
of
love
and
a
sense
of
right
a
certain
part
of
his
daily
work
such
as
seeing
that
the
all
over
the
house
are
filled
or
some
similar
share
of
the
general
labor
of
the
household
may
be
regarded
as
that
for
which
he
is
paid
wages
and
any
extra
task
which
does
not
justly
belong
to
him
he
may
sometimes
be
paid
for
performing
but
not
always
for
instance
he
ought
to
be
willing
to
run
to
the
grocery
for
mother
without
demanding
that
he
be
paid
a
penny
for
the
job
yet
sometimes
the
penny
may
be
forthcoming
the
point
is
that
he
should
be
ready
to
work
even
to
work
hard
without
pay
and
yet
that
he
should
never
feel
that
his
mother
withholds
pay
from
him
when
she
can
give
it
and
he
receive
it
without
injury

when
the

should

and
if
he
insists
upon
spending
it
foolishly
should
be
allowed
to
do
it
and
to
suffer
to
the
full
the
uncomfortable
consequences
if
on
the
contrary
he
will
not
spend
it
at
all
his
mother
must
use
every
means
in
her
power
to
lessen
the
desire
for
ownership
and
to
increase
his
love
for
others
and
his
eagerness
to
please
them
as
judgment
develops
the
allowance
may
well
be
increased
to
provide
for
necessities
in
the
way
of
incidentals
and
clothing
until
at
the
age
of
discretion
he
is
in
full
charge
of
the
funds
for
his
personal
expenses

should
be
encouraged
to
apply

occasionally
it

becomes

is

it
remains

that
the

in

is
far
below
the

level
of

the
subject

instead

than

is

with
neither

to
this
aim
rendered
significant
however
because
it
is
the
earnest
of
a
great
faith
and
a
great
hope
so
far
as
sunday
schools
help
children
it
is
because
of
this
spirit
of
faithfulness
and
not
because
of
the
form
which
it
has
assumed
in
choosing
then
whether
you
shall
send
your
child
to
a
sunday
school
choose
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
this
spirit
if
you
know
the
teachers
of
the
sunday
school
to
be
earnest
loving
and
devoted
you
may
with
safety
assume
that
their
personal
influence
will
make
up
for
what
is
archaic
in
their
method
of
teaching
where
the
spirit
is
present
only
in
a
few
or
where
it
manifests
itself
only
occasionally
as
at
seasons
of
revival
you
may
well
hesitate
to
let
your
child
attend
a
great
improvement
would
come
about
if
parents
would
show
a
greater
interest
and
encourage
proper
teachers
to
take
charge
of
classes
it
is
a
thankless
task
at
present
sidenote
theory
not
practice
there
is
one
great
danger
in
the
teaching
of
any
sunday
school
one
which
the
best
of
them
can
not
wholly
escape
and
that
is
that
in
the
very
nature
of
things
they
teach
theory
and
not
practice
harmful
as
this
may
be
indeed
as
it
surely
is
in
adult
life
it
does
not
begin
to
be
so
harmful
as
it
does
in
youth
for
the
young
child
as
we
have
seen
is
and
should
remain
a
unit
in
consciousness
his
life
his
intellect
and
his
will
are
one
an
undivided
trinity
the
divorce
of
these
three
is
at
any
time
a
regrettable
occurrence
the
divorce
of
them
in
early
life
is
an
almost
irreparable
disaster
sidenote
useless
truths
the
current
theory
is
that
children
will
learn
many
truths
in
the
sunday
school
which
they
will
not
put
into
practice
then
perhaps
but
which
they
will
find
useful
in
later
life
this
fallacy
underlies
of
course
almost
all
conventional
education
and
has
only
been
overthrown
by
the
dictum
of
modern
psychology
that
there
is
but
small
storage
accommodation
in
the
brain
for
facts
which
have
no
immediate
relation
to
life
what
may
be
termed
the
saturating
power
of
the
brain
is
limited
and
after
it
has
soaked
up
a
rather
small
number
of
truths
it
can
contain
no
more
until
it
has
in
some
way
disposed
of
those
that
it
still
has
either
by
making
them
part
of
its
own
living
structure
which
is
done
only
by
making
immediate
application
of
them
or
by
dropping
them
below
the
threshold
of
consciousness
that
is
in
common
language
forgetting
them
moreover
the
brain
may
form
the
habit
of
easily
dropping
all
that
relates
to
a
given
subject
into
the
limbo
where
unused
things
lie
disregarded
and
when
this
becomes
the
habitual
method
of
disposing
of
religious
instruction
the
results
are
particularly
deplorable
sidenote
the
mother
as
teacher
feeble
as
her
own
knowledge
may
be
a
mother
has
certain
advantages
as
a
teacher
of
her
children
over
any
but
the
exceptional
sunday
school
teacher
for
first
she
knows
the
children
and
knowing
them
knows
their
needs
secondly
she
knows
their
daily
lives
and
continually
during
the
week
can
point
out
wherein
they
fail
to
live
up
to
their
sunday
lesson
and
again
and
most
important

them
tenderly
and
from
love
flows
wisdom
usually
the
mother
gives
her
own
children
a
love
far
beyond
that
given
by
anyone
else
and
this
deeper
love
sharpens
her
intellectual
faculties
and
makes
her
both
a
keen
observer
and
a
good
tactician
giving
her
children
some
simple
lesson
on
sunday
afternoon
she
finds
a
hundred
opportunities
to
make
the
lesson
living
and
vital
to
them
during
the
succeeding
week
sidenote
religious
enthusiasm
in
the
early
years
of
the
child
life
the
mother
is
usually
the
one
to
decide
whether
he
shall
attend
sunday
school
or
not
but
as
he
approaches
adolescence
he
is
likely
to
take
the
matter
in
his
own
hands
and
if
it
happens
that
some
revivalist
or
a
new
stirring
preacher
comes
in
contact
with
his
life
at
this
time
he
is
very
likely
to
be
swept
off
his
feet
with
a
sudden
zeal
of
religious
enthusiasm
which
his
mother
fears
to
check
the
reports
of
memberships
baptisms
show
that
a
large
number
become
converted
and
join
the
church
during
adolescence
while
this
does
not
in
the
least
argue
that
the
conclusions
that
they
reach
at
that
time
are
therefore
unsound
for
adolescence
is
not
a
disease
nor
a
form
of
insanity
but
a
normal
if
excitable
condition
still
it
does
prove
when
coupled
with
the
further
fact
that
in
adult
life
these
young
converts
often
relapse
into
their
previous
condition
that
a
more
lasting
basis
for
religion
must
be
found
than
the
emotional
intensity
of
this
period
of
life
a
religion
to
be
lasting
must
be
coldly
reaffirmed
by
the
intellect
the
dictum
of
the
heart
alone
is
not
sufficient
religious
enthusiasm
like
all
other
forms
of
enthusiasm
tends
of
itself
to
bring
about
the
opposite
condition
and
to
be
succeeded
by
fits
of
despondency
and
bitterness
as
intense
and
severe
as
the
enthusiasm
itself
was
brilliant
and
ecstatic
the
history
of
all
great
religious
leaders
amply
proves
this
they
had
their
bitter
hours
of
wrestling
with
the
powers
of
darkness
hours
which
almost
the
hours
of
uplift
only
clearly
intellectual
convictions
reinforced
by
the
habit
of
daily
righteous
living
can
secure
the
soul
against
such
emotional
aberrations
sidenote
danger
of
reaction
therefore
although
the
religious
excitability
of
adolescence
must
not
be
thwarted
lest
it
be
turned
into
less
helpful
channels
and
lest
religion
lose
all
the
beauty
and
compelling
power
lent
to
it
by
the
glow
of
youthful
feelings
yet
it
must
be
so
balanced
and
ordered
by
a
clear
reason
and
especially
by
the
habit
of
putting
each
enthusiasm
to
the
test
of
conduct
that
the
young
mind
may
remain
true
to
its
law
of
growth
developing
harmoniously
on
all
three
sides
at
once
the
danger
of
permitting
a
young
boy
or
girl
while
under
the
influence
of
this
emotional
instability
to
enter
into
any
special
form
of
religious
service
is
the
danger
of
reaction
he
will
discover
that
all
is
not
as
his
early
vision
led
him
to
suppose
because
that
early
vision
was
of
things
too
high
and
holy
for
any
earthly
realization
and
he
may
turn
against
what
seems
to
him
to
be
hypocrisy
and
pretense
with
a
bitterness
proportioned
to
his
former
love
many
honest
faithful
men
and
women
remain
in
this
state
of
reaction
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
sidenote
a
difficult
period
nevertheless
it
will
not
do
to
thwart
these
young
beginnings
they
must
neither
be
nipped
in
the
bud
nor
forced
to
a
premature
ripening
above
all
they
must
not
be
suffered
to
endure
the
killing
frost
of
ridicule
the
period
is
a
difficult
one
but
as

points
out
it
is
supremely
the

if
she
can
hold
her
boy
or
her
girl
confidence
now
can
ease
their
eager
young
hearts
with
an
intelligent
sympathy
she
can
probably
keep
them
from
any
public
commitment
perhaps
they
may
desire
to
confide
in
the
minister
if
so
let
the
mother
confide
in
him
first
perhaps
they
have
bosom
friends
passing
through
the
same
stirring
experience
then
let
the
mother
win
over
these
friends
her
object
should
be
to
shelter
this
beautiful
sentiment
to
keep
it
safe
from
exposure

to
do

the
only
way
open
is
to
join
the

to
make
a

the
wise
mother
will
see
to
it
that
there
are
other
ways
urging
the
young
knight
to
serve
his
king
by
going
forth
into
the
world
immediately
about
him
and
fighting
against
all
forms
of
evil
giving
him
a
practical
definite
quest
the
result
of
such
restriction
of
public
speech
and
stimulation
of
private

will
be
a
sincere

so
inwoven
with
the
truest

a

sidenote
bible
study
now
is
supremely
the
time
for
a
study
of
the
bible
interesting
as
a
divine
story
book
to
the
young
children
it
becomes
the
book
of
life
to
these
older
ones
in
teaching
it
at
home
a
few
simple
rules
need
to
be
borne
in
mind
the
first
is
that
the
bible
must
be
thought
of
not
as
a
series
of
disconnected
texts
and
thoughts
but
as
a
connected
whole
the
division
of
king
james
bible
into
verses
and
chapters
is
but
poorly
adapted
to
this
purpose
the
illogical
strange
character
of
the
paragraphing
as
measured
by
the
standards
of
modern
english
is
apparent
at
a
glance
for
often
a
verse
will
end
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
the
sentence
be
concluded
in
the
next
verse
the
chapters
in
the
same
way
often
fail
to
finish
the
subject
with
which
they
deal
and
sometimes
include
several
subjects
therefore
the
mother
who
undertakes
to
read
the
bible
to
her
children
needs
first
to
go
through
the
lesson
herself
and
to
decide
what
subject
not
what
chapter
she
will
take
up
that
day
there
is
a
reader
edition
of
the
bible
and
one
called
the
children
bible
both
of
which
aim
to
leave
out
all
repetition
and
references
and
to
arrange
the
bible
narrative
in
a
simple
consecutive
order
nevertheless
employing
the
beautiful
bible
language
these
editions
might
prove
of
considerable
help
to
mothers
who
feel
unequal
to
doing
the
work
by
themselves
sidenote
children
bible
second
comparable
to
this
in
importance
is
the
reading
of
the
bible
and
talking
about
it
in
a
perfectly
ordinary
tone
of
voice
for
what
you
want
is
to
make
the
bible
teachings
live
in
you
must
not
therefore
suggest
by
your
tone
or
manner
that
they
belong
to
another
day
and
that
they
are
in
some
sense
to
be
shut
out
from
common
life
and
speech
this
does
not
mean
such
common
use
of
biblical
phrases
in
every
day
conversation
as
to
cause
it
to
grow
into
that
form
or
irreverence
known
as
cant
but
it
does
mean
simple
usage
of
bible
thought
and
the
effort
to
fit
it
to
the
conditions
of
daily
life
such
a
habit
in
itself
will
force
any
family
to
discriminate
as
to
what
things
in
the
bible
are
living
and
eternal
and
what
things
belong
rightly
to
that
far
away
time
and
place
of
which
the
bible
narrative
treats
thus
practicing
both
teacher
and
pupils
that
is
both

and
children
in
the
art
of
finding
the
universal
spirit
of

disguises

we
have
considered
some
of
the
fundamental
principles
of

when
we
think
of
the
complex
inheritance
of
the
american
people
it
is
perhaps
no
wonder
that
many
families
contain
individuals
varying
so
widely
from
each
other
as
to
seem
to
require
each
a
complete
system
of
education
all
to
himself
we
are
a
people
born
late
in
the
history
of
the
race
and
our
blood
is
mingled
of
the
norseman
the
celt
and
the
latin
advancing
civilization
alone
would
tend
to
make
us
more
complex
our
problems
more
subtle
but
in
addition
to
this
we
are
mixed
of
all
races
and
born
in
times
so
strenuous
that
sooner
or
later
every
fibre
of
our
weaving
is
strained
and
brought
into
prominence
in
the
letters
from
my
students
this
fact
with
which
i
was
already
familiar
in
a
general
sort
of
way
has
been
brought
more
particularly
to
my
attention
in
all
cases
the
situation
has
been
responsible
for
much
confusion
and
difficulty
in
a
good
many
it
has
led
to
family
tragedies
varying
in
magnitude
from
the
unhappiness
of
the
misunderstood
child
to
that
of
the
lonely
woman
suffering
in
adult
life
from
the
faults
of
her
upbringing
and
the
failure
of
the
family
ties
whose
need
she
felt
the
more
as
the
duties
of
motherhood
pressed
upon
her
if
it
were
possible
for
me
to
violate
the
confidence
of
my
pupils
i
could
prove
very
conclusively
that
the
system
of
bringing
up
children
on
the
three
r
and
a
spanking
did
not
work
so
well
as
some
persons
seem
to
think
i
could
prove
that
the
problem
has
grown
past
the
point
where
instinct
and
tradition
may
be
held
as
sufficient
to
solve
it
everyone
seeing
these
letters
would
be
obliged
to
confess
yes
indeed
here
is
plain
need
of
training
for

would
be
tempted
to
inquire
but
can
any
training
meet
such
a
difficult
situation
here
is
despair
and
some
cause
for
it
when
one
own
mother
has
not
understood
one
when
one
has
lived
lonely
in
the
midst
of
brothers
and
sisters
who
are
more
strange
than
strangers
when
one
childhood
is
full
of
the
memory
of
obscure
but
intense
sufferings
one
flies
for
relief
perhaps
to
any
one
who
offers
it
hopefully
enough
but
one
does
not
really
expect
to
get
it
training
especially
by
correspondence
meet
the
need
not
wholly
of
course
let
us
be
frank
to
admit
no
amount
of
theory
however
excellent
can
take
the
place
of
the
drill
given
only
in
the
hard
school
of
experience
but
when
the
theory
is
not
merely
theory
but
sound
principle
based
on
scientific
observation
confirmed
by
the
wide
experience
of
many
persons
it
is
as
valuable
in
practical
life
as
any
rule
of
mathematics
to
the
practical
engineer
we
all
know
that
the
technical
correspondence
schools
really
do
fit
young
mechanics
to
move
on
and
up
in
the
trade
by
correspondence
he
is
given
what
froebel
calls
the
interpreting
word
the
experience
in
application
the
student
has
to
supply
himself
so
in
the
matter
of
education
there
are
genuine
principles
which
underlie
the
development
of
every
child
that
lives
even
the
deaf
and
blind
read
helen
keller
wonderful
life
if
you
want
to
see
the
proof
of
it
just
as
surely
as
a
child
has
two
legs
and
has
to
learn
to
walk
on
them
by
a
series
of
prolonged
experiments
just
so
surely
he
has
a
a
sense
of
justice
b
an
instinct
for
freedom
c
a
love
of
play
every
kind
of
child
has
all
these
instincts
as
much
as
he
has
love
for
food
and
drink
and
to
educate
him
consists
in
developing
these
instincts
into
a
the
habit
of
dealing
justly
by
others
b
the
right
use
of
freedom
c
love
of
work
the
particular
methods
may
differ
the
principles
not
and
can
not
she
who
would
succeed
in
child
training
must
hold
to
these
truths
with
all
her
might
and
main
making
them
in
fact
her
religion
for
they
are
the
doctrines
of
the
christian
religion
as
applied
to
motherhood
to
hold
them
lightly
or
even
experimentally
will
not
do
one
most
walk
in
faith
and
that
the
faith
may
not
be
blind
but
may
be
based
on
experience
and
understanding
let
me
suggest
this
means
of
proof
instead
of
asking
yourself
how
the
laws
laid
down
in
these
little
books
would
fit
this
or
that
particular
child
your
own
or
another
ask
how
they
would
have
fitted
you
if
they
had
been
applied
to
you
by
your
own
mother
take
the
chapter
on
faults
pick
out
the
one
which
was
yours
in
childhood
oh
of
course
you
got
over
it
now
think
of
some
bitter
trouble
into
which
that
fault
hurried
you
and
conceive
that
instead
of
the
punishment
you
did
receive
you
had
been
treated
as
the
lesson
suggests
what
do
you
think
would
have
been
the
result
and
so
with
the
other
chapters
even
with
that
question
of
companionship
test
the
truth
of
them
all
by
their
imaginary
application
to
the
child
you
know
best
when
you
can
find
the
principles
that
your
own
mother
did
employ
in
your
education
and
examine
the
result
of
what
she
did
some
of
the
principles
will
suddenly
become
luminous
to
you
i
am
sure
and
some
things
that
happened
in
the
past
receive
an
explanation
such
a
to
be
of
any
value
must
be
rigidly
honest
there
is
too
much
at
stake
here
for
you
to
permit
any
remnants
of
bitter
feeling
to
influence
your
judgment
and
you
will
surely
be
surprised
to
find
how
many
bitter
resentments
will
show
that
they
yet
have
life
the
past
is
dead
as
far
as
your
power
to
change
it
is
concerned
but
it
lives
as
a
thing
that
you
can
use
here
is
your
own
child
to
be
helped
or
hindered
by
what
you
may
have
endured
it
will
all
have
been
worth
while
if
by
means
of
it
you
can
save
him
from
some
bruises
and
falls
every
bitterness
will
be
sweetened
if
you
can
look
through
it
and
find
the
truth
which
shall
serve
this
dearer
little
self
who
looks
to
you
for
guidance
then
when
you
have
found
the
principles
true
and
not
one
minute
before
put
them
rigidly
into
practice
i
say
not
one
minute
before
you
are
convinced
because
it
is
better
to
hold
the
truth
lightly
in
the
memory
as
a
mere
interesting
theory
you
have
never
had
time
to
test
than
to
swallow
it
half
assimilated
truth
is
a
real
and
living
power
once
it
is
applied
to
life
and
to
it
in
doubt
and
fear
is
to
invite
indigestion
and
consequent
disgust
take
of
these
teachings
that
which
you
are
sure
is
sound
and
right
and
use
it
faithfully
and
unremittingly
be
careful
that
no
plea
of
expediency
no
hurry
of
the
moment
makes
you
false
if
you
are
thus
faithful
in
small
things
one
after
the
other
in
a
series
fitted
to
your
own
peculiar
constitution
the
others
will
prove
themselves
to
you
for
they
are
coherent
truths
and
not
one
lives
to
itself
alone
but
joins
hands
with
all
the
rest
being
truths
they
fit
all
human
minds
yours
and
mine
and
those
of
our
children
no
matter
how
diverse
we
may
be
other
people
children
is
it
ridiculously
true
that
as
soon
as
we
get
enlightened
ourselves
we
burn
to
enlighten
the
rest
of
the
world
we
do
not
seem
to
remember
our
own
feelings
during
the
years
of
darkness
and
the
contentment
of
those
who
remain
as
we
were
surpasses
our
power
of
comprehension
it
is
really
comforting
to
my
own
sense
of
impatience
and
balked
zeal
to
find
how
many
of
my
pupils
are
dreadfully
concerned
about
other
people
children
this
one
heart
burns
over
the
little
boy
next
door
who
is
shamefully
mismanaged
and
who
already
begins
to
show
the
ill
effects
of
his
treatment
that
one
has
a
who
refuses
to
listen
to
a
word
spoken
in
season
between
my
smiles
those
comfortable
smiles
with
which
we
recognize
our
own
shortcomings
i
too
am
really
concerned
about
the
children
it
is
true
that
their
mother
ought
to
be
taught
better
and
that
if
she
is
those
innocent
lambs
are
going
to
suffer
for
it
off
at
this
distance
without
the
ties
of
kindred
to
draw
me
too
close
for
clear
judgment
i
see
though
that
we
have
to
walk
very
cautiously
here
for
fear
of
doing
more
harm
than
good
better
that
those
benighted
women
never
heard
the
name
of
than
to
hear
it
only
to
greet
it
with
rebellion
and
hatred
yet
to
force
any
of
our
principles
upon
her
attention
when
she
is
in
a
hostile
mood
or
to
them
indeed
in
any
mood
is
to
invite
just
this
attitude
most
of
us
by
the
time
that
we
are
sufficiently
grown
up
to
undertake
the
study
of
child
life
have
outgrown
the
habit
of
plainly
telling
our
friends
to
their
faces
just
what
we
think
of
their
faults
yet
this
is
a
safe
and
pleasant
pastime
beside
that
other
of
trying
to
tell
them
how
to
bring
up
their
children
you
stand
it
from
me
because
you
have
invited
it
and
perhaps
still
more
because
you
never
see
me
and
the
personal
element
enters
only
slightly
and
pleasantly
into
our
relationship
i
sometimes
think
that
students
pour
out
their
hearts
to
me
much
as
we
used
to
talk
to
our
girl
friends
in
the
dark
i
very
sure
i
should
never
dare
to
say
to
their
faces
what
i
write
so
freely
on
the
backs
of
their
papers
you
see
the
adult
too
has
his
love
of
freedom
and
while
he
can
stand
an
indirect
impersonal
preachment
which
he
may
reject
if
he
likes
without
apology
he
will
not
stand
the
insistence
of
a
personal
appeal
i
let
little
women
shame
me
into
better
conduct
when
i
was
a
girl
at
times
when
no
direct
speech
from
a
living
soul
would
have
brought
me
to
anything
but
defiance
have
you
we
have
to
apply
our
principles
to
the
adult
world
about
us
well
as
to
the
and
teach
when
we
permit
ourselves
to
teach
at
all
chiefly
by
example
by
cheerful
confession
of
fallibility
by
above
all
things
we
have
to
respect
the
freedom
of
these
others
about
whom
we
are
so
inconveniently
anxious
it
is
fair
though
that
the
spoken
word
should
interpret
what
we
do
it
is
fair
enough
to
tell
your
what
you
think
and
ask
her
judgment
upon
it
if
you
can
trust
yourself
not
to
rub
your
own
judgment
in
too
hard
if
you
are
unmarried
and
a
teacher
you
will
have
to
concede
to
her
preposterous
marital
conceit
a
humble
and
inquiring
attitude
and
console
your
flustered
soul
by
setting
it
to
the
ingenious
task
of
teaching
by
means
of
a
graduated
series
of
artful
inquiries
do
oh
do
seek
for
an
outspoken
victory
be
content
if
some
day
you
hear
her
proclaim
your
truth
as
her
own
discovery
it
never
was
yours
anyway
any
more
than
it
is
hers
or
than
it
is
mine
be
glad
that
while
she
claims
it
she
at
least
holds
it
close
if
you
are
a
mother
you
are
in
an
easier
case
you
can
do
to
your
own
children
just
what
she
ought
to
do
to
hers
and
tell
about
it
softly
as
if
sure
of
her
sympathy
if
you
are
very
sincere
in
your
desire
for
the
welfare
of
her
child
you
may
even
ask
her
advice
about
yours
and
so
gain
the
right
to
offer
a
little
in
exchange
say
of
what
she
gives
all
these
warnings
apply
to
unsought
advice
a
dangerous
thing
to
offer
under
any
circumstances
except
there
is
a
real
emergency
you
had
better
avoid
it
if
your
nephew
or
little
neighbor
is
winning
along
through
his
troubles
fairly
well
best
keep
hands
off
but
if
you
absolutely
interfere
guard
yourself
as
i
suggest
and
remember
that
even
then
you
will
assuredly
get
burned
if
you
play
long
with
that
dangerous
fire
of
maternal
pride
when
your
advice
is
sought
you
are
in
a
different
position
then
you
have
a
right
to
speak
out
though
if
you
are
wise
and
loving
you
will
temper
that
right
with
charity
no
one
can
be
too
gentle
in
dealing
with
a
soul
that
honestly
asks
for
help
but
one
can
easily
be
too
timid
think
under
these
circumstances
of
yourself
not
at
all
but
put
yourself
as
much
as
possible
in
her
place
be
led
by
her
questions
and
answer
fearlessly
from
the
depths
of
the
best
truth
you
hold
then
leave
it
you
can
do
no
more
what
becomes
of
that
truth
once
you
have
lovingly
spoken
it
is
no
more
of
your
concern
the
sex
question
always
convinced
of
the
importance
of
this
subject
convictions
have
deepened
to
the
point
of
dismay
since
learning
through
this
school
of
the
many
women
who
have
suffered
and
who
continue
to
suffer
both
mentally
and
physically
because
in
early
girlhood
they
were
not
taught
those
finer
physiological
facts
upon
which
the
very
life
of
the
race
depends
yet
strangely
enough
these
very
victims
find
it
almost
impossible
to
give
their
children
the
knowledge
necessary
to
save
them
from
a
similar
fate
it
is
as
if
the
lack
of
early
training
in
themselves
leaves
them
helpless
before
a
situation
from
which
they
suffer
but
which
they
have
never
mastered
of
course
such
feelings
in
themselves
morbid
are
not
to
be
trusted
faced
with
a
task
like
this
we
have
only
to
ask
ourselves
not
is
it
hard
but
is
it
in
truth
my
task
if
it
is
we
may
be
sure
that
we
shall
be
given
strength
to
do
it
provided
only
that
we
are
sincere
in
our
willingness
to
do
it
and
do
not
count
our
feelings
at
all
it
is
preposterous
to
have
such
feelings
in
the
first
place
they
are
wholly
the
product
of
false
teaching
for
we
have
no
right
as
we
recognize
when
we
stop
to
think
about
it
in
calmness
of
spirit
and
apart
from
our
special
difficult
to
sit
in
scornful
judgment
upon
any
of
the
laws
of
nature
when
we
find
ourselves
in
rebellion
against
them
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
change
the
state
of
our
minds
for
change
the
laws
we
can
not
if
we
women
could
inaugurate
a
gigantic
strike
against
the
present
method
of
bearing
children
and
i
imagine
that
millions
would
join
such
a
strike
if
it
held
out
any
promise
of
success
we
still
could
accomplish
nothing
to
fret
ourselves
into
a
frazzle
over
it
is
to
accomplish
less
than
nothing
it
is
to
enter
upon
the
pathway
to
destruction
in
teaching
our
children
then
we
have
first
to
conquer
ourselves
that
painful
reiterated
primal
necessity
which
must
underlie
all
teaching
having
done
so
we
shall
find
our
task
easier
than
we
supposed
the
children
own
questions
will
lead
us
and
if
we
simply
make
it
a
rule
never
to
answer
a
question
falsely
no
matter
how
far
it
may
probe
we
shall
find
ourselves
not
only
enlightening
but
receiving
enlightenment
for
nothing
is
so
sure
an
antidote
to
morbidness
as
the
unspoiled
mind
of
a
child
he
looks
at
the
facts
with
such
a
calm
level
gaze
that
proportions
are
restored
to
us
as
we
follow
his
look
many
of
my
letters
show
that
adult
women
wives
and
mothers
still
grope
for
the
truth
that
lies
plain
to
the
eyes
of
any
simple
child
the
truth
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
clean
and
unclean
only
use
and
misuse
others
through
love
and
the
splendid
revelations
that
it
makes
have
risen
so
far
above
their
former
misconceptions
that
they
fear
to
tell
a
child
the
facts
before
he
has
experienced
the
love
i
can
imagine
that
in
an
ideal
world
some
such
reticence
might
be
good
and
right
but
this
is
far
from
an
ideal
world
we
have
to
train
our
children
relatively
not
absolutely
in
the
knowledge
that
we
do
not
control
all
their
environment
i
think
the
solution
of
the
difficulty
is
to
teach
the
facts
of
sex
in
a
perfectly
calm
unemotional
manner
just
as
one
teaches
the
laws
of
digestion
when
knowledge
of
evil
is
thrust
upon
our
child
let
us
be
sorry
with
him
that
those
other
children
have
never
been
taught
and
that
they
are
doing
their
bodies
such
sad
mischief
but
do
exaggerate
it
do
be
too
shocked
do
condemn
the
poor
little
sinners
who
are
also
victims
too
severely
charity
toward
is
the
best
prophylactic
against
imitation
we
never
feel
the
lure
of
a
sin
which
grieves
us
in
another
but
often
the
call
of
a
sin
which
we
too
strongly
condemn
because
the
very
strength
of
the
condemnation
rouses
our
imaginations
is
in
itself
an
emotion
and
since
it
is
certainly
not
a
loving
one
must
necessarily
be
linked
with
all
other
unloving
and
therefore
evil
emotions
as
far
as
possible
let
us
keep
feeling
out
of
this
subject
until
such
time
as
the
true
and
beautiful
feeling
of
love
between
husband
and
wife
arises
and
uplifts
it
fathers
and
now
comes
the
editor
of
these
lessons
and
accuses
me
of
neglecting
the
fathers
nothing
in
this
world
could
be
farther
from
my
thoughts
not
only
do
i
agree
with
him
that
all
ordinary
children
have
fathers
and
it
might
be
well
to
put
in
a
paragraph
but
i
am
cheerfully
willing
to
write
a
whole
book
on
the
subject
provided
that
a
mere
modicum
of
readers
can
be
assured
me
i
fairly
ache
to
talk
to
fathers
having
a
really
great
ideal
of
them
and
whenever
a
class
of
them
can
be
induced
to
take
up
a
correspondence
course
i
shall
be
glad
to
conduct
it
joking
aside
however
i
truly
feel
that
the
saddest
lack
many
of
our
children
have
to
suffer
is
the
lack
of
fathers
and
the
saddest
lack
our
men
have
to
suffer
is
the
lack
of
children
so
little
are
most
men
awake
to
this
subject
that
i
am
perfectly
convinced
that
much
of
the
prevalent
race
suicide
is
due
to
their
objections
to
a
large
family
rather
than
to
their
wives
upon
them
comes
the
burden
of
support
they
get
few
of
the
joys
which
belong
to
children
and
nearly
all
of
the
woes
seldom
do
they
share
the
games
of
their
offspring
or
their
happy
times
and
almost
always
the
worst
difficulties
are
thrust
upon
them
for
solution
not
that
they
often
solve
them
how
can
we
expect
it
there
is
edgar
growing
very
untruthful
and
defiant
we
have
concealed
all
the
first
stages
of
the
disease
for
fear
of
bothering
poor
tired
papa
at
last
it
reaches
such
a
height
that
we
can
conceal
it
no
longer
we
fling
the
desperate
boy
at
the
very
head
of
the
bewildered
father
and
then
have
turns
of
bitter
disappointment
because
the
remedies
that
are
applied
may
be
so
much
cruder
even
than
our
own
here
is
a
boy
who
gets
close
to
his
father
only
to
find
the
proximity
very
uncomfortable
and
a
father
who
becomes
acquainted
with
his
son
only
through
the
ugly
revelations
of
his
worst
faults
not
but
that
the
fathers
are
somewhat
to
blame
too
without
urging
by
us
they
ought
of
course
to
take
a
spontaneous
interest
in
the
lives
for
which
they
are
responsible
they
ought
to
and
they
often
do
but
the
interest
is
sometimes
and
consequently
unwelcome
there
are
fathers
whose
interest
is
a
most
inconvenient
thing
when
they
are
at
home
they
run
everything
growl
at
everything
upset
as
like
as
not
all
that
the
mother
has
been
trying
to
do
during
the
day
i
know
wives
who
are
distinctly
glad
to
encourage
their
husbands
in
the
habit
of
lunching
so
that
they
can
have
a
little
room
for
their
own
peculiar
form
of
activity
and
maybe
we
all
have
times
of
sympathizing
with
the
woman
in
this
familiar
story
there
was
a
man
once
who
never
left
the
house
without
a
list
of
directions
to
his
wife
as
to
how
she
should
manage
things
during
his
absence
better
have
the
children
carry
umbrellas
this
morning
it
going
to
rain
said
he
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
be
sure
to
put
on
their
rubbers
and
since
the
baby
is
so
croupy
i
get
out
his
winter
flannels
if
i
were
you
yes
dear
said
the
patient
wife
make
your
mind
easy
i
take
just
as
good
care
of
them
as
if
they
were
my
own
children
of
course
this
is
an
extreme
case
there
are
other
fathers
whose
whole
idea
of
the
parental
relation
seems
to
be
indulgence
no
system
of
discipline
however
mild
can
be
carried
out
when
such
a
man
wins
the
children
hearts
and
ruins
their
dispositions
it
is
he
is
it
i
do
quite
recollect
the
tale
who
was
sent
after
death
to
the
warm
regions
there
to
expiate
his
many
sins
of
omission
and
his
adoring
children
who
had
been
hauled
to
heaven
by
the
main
strength
let
us
say
of
their
mother
found
that
the
only
thing
they
could
do
for
him
was
to
call
out
celestial
hose
company
number
one
and
ask
them
to
play
awhile
upon
the
overheated
apartments
of
poor
tired
papa
the
truth
is
sit
close
and
let
no
man
hear
what
we
say
that
these
fathers
are
much
what
we
the
mothers
make
them
if
under
the
mistaken
idea
of
saving
father
from
all
the
worries
of
the
children
we
hurry
the
youngsters
off
to
bed
before
he
comes
home
in
the
evening
conceal
our
over
them
do
our
work
in
secret
and
solitude
meditate
in
the
same
fashion
over
plans
for
their
upbringing
talk
to
our
neighbors
but
never
to
him
about
the
daily
troubles
how
can
we
expect
any
man
on
earth
no
matter
how
susceptible
of
later
angelic
growth
to
become
a
wise
and
devoted
father
tired
or
not
he
is
a
father
not
a
mere
whether
he
likes
it
at
the
moment
or
not
it
is
for
his
soul
health
for
him
to
enter
into
the
full
life
of
his
family
including
those
problems
which
are
at
the
very
heart
of
it
after
his
day
of
grinding
and
very
likely
unloving
work
at
the
office
here
love
enters
to
interpret
to
soften
to
make
all
principles
live
here
alone
he
can
give
himself
to
those
gentler
forms
of
judgment
which
are
necessary
as
much
to
the
completion
of
his
own
character
as
to
the
happiness
and
welfare
of
his
wife
and
children
someone
has
said
that
we
wrong
our
friends
when
we
ask
nothing
of
them
and
certainly
it
is
true
that
we
wrong
our
husbands
when
we
do
not
demand
big
and
splendid
things
of
them
that
word
demand
troubles
me
a
little
so
many
women
demand
and
demand
terribly
but
what
they
demand
is
indulgence
sympathy
interest
i
think
sometimes
that
they
crave
a
man
utter
absorption
in
themselves
much
as
a
man
craves
strong
drink
it
is
their
form
of
intoxication
such
demanding
is
not
of
course
what
i
mean
demand
nothing
for
yourself
beyond
simple
justice
not
love
for
that
flies
at
the
very
sound
of
demand
and
dies
before
nagging
but
demand
for
the
man
himself
call
upon
his
nobler
qualities
and
do
let
him
palm
off
on
you
his
many
a
man
is
loved
and
honored
by
his
business
associates
whose
wife
and
children
never
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
finer
side
of
him
demand
the
exercise
of
these
fine
traits
in
the
home
demand
that
he
be
a
fine
man
in
the
eyes
of
his
children
as
in
the
eyes
of
his
friends
be
sure
that
he
will
rise
to
the
occasion
with
a
splendid
sense
of
having
now
a
home
that
is
a
home
of
having
a
wife
who
is
wived
to
the
man
he
likes
best
to
be
this
bids
fair
to
be
as
i
knew
it
would
if
once
i
permitted
myself
to
write
at
all
on
the
subject
not
a
paragraph
but
a
whole
essay
or
perhaps
if
i
did
not
check
myself
a
whole
volume
but
after
all
what
i
want
to
say
is
merely
that
as
no
child
can
be
born
without
a
father
so
he
can
not
be
properly
trained
without
a
father
daily
assistance
and
that
since
most
fathers
come
to
the
task
even
more
untrained
than
the
mothers
some
training
must
be
undertaken
by
whom
by
the
mother
it
is
i
solemnly
believe
your
duty
to
go
ahead
a
little
on
this
part
of
the
journey
find
out
what
ought
to
be
done
and
teach
coax
induce
your
husband
to
with
you
in
these
things
no
one
knows
better
than
you
do
that
he
is
only
a
boy
at
heart
after
all
perhaps
the
very
dearest
boy
of
them
all
this
boy
you
have
to
help
while
yet
the
other
children
are
little
but
be
sure
that
as
you
teach
him
so
all
the
time
will
he
teach
you
every
principle
laid
down
in
this
book
above
all
others
the
principle
of
will
apply
to
him
he
will
take
the
lessons
a
trifle
more
reluctantly
but
more
lastingly
than
the
younger
boys
and
in
a
little
while
you
will
be
envied
of
all
your
women
friends
because
of
the
competency
the
reliability
the
contentment
of
your
children
father
the
unconscious
influence
when
all
is
said
and
done
it
remains
true
that
the
finest
the
most
subtle
and
penetrating
influence
in
education
is
precisely
that
education
for
which
no
rules
can
be
laid
down
it
is
the
silent
influence
of
the
motives
which
impel
the
persons
who
constantly
surround
us
if
we
examine
for
a
little
our
own
childhood
we
see
at
once
that
this
is
so
what
are
those
canons
of
conduct
by
which
we
judge
others
and
even
occasionally
ourselves
whence
came
that
list
of
things
those
things
that
are
so
closed
to
us
that
we
can
not
even
under
great
stress
of
temptation
conceive
ourselves
as
yielding
to
them
there
is
an
enlightening
story
of
a
young
man
born
and
bred
a
gentleman
who
by
the
way
of
fast
living
falls
upon
poverty
in
the
hard
pressure
of
his
financial
affairs
he
is
about
to
commit
suicide
when
suddenly
he
finds
in
an
empty
cab
a
roll
of
bills
amounting
to
some
thousands
of
dollars
the
circumstances
are
such
that
he
knows
that
he
can
if
he
will
discover
the
owner
or
he
can
without
fear
of
detection
keep
the
money
himself
he
makes
up
his
mind
deliberately
to
keep
it
and
then
almost
against
his
will
subconsciously
as
it
were
walks
to
the
office
of
the
man
who
lost
the
money
and
restores
it
to
him
now
doubtless
in
his
downward
career
he
had
done
many
things
which
judged
by
any
absolute
standard
of
morality
were
quite
as
wrong
as
the
keeping
of
that
money
would
have
been
but
the
fact
remained
that
he
could
not
do
that
deed
others
yes
but
not
that
he
was
a
gentleman
and
gentlemen
do
not
steal
private
property
whatever
they
may
do
about
public
property
yet
probably
in
all
his
life
he
had
not
once
been
told
not
to
steal
not
one
word
had
he
been
taught
openly
on
the
subject
no
one
whom
he
knew
stole
he
was
never
expected
to
steal
stealing
was
a
sin
beyond
the
pale
so
strong
was
this
unconscious
influence
that
by
it
he
was
saved
in
the
hour
of
extreme
need
from
even
feeling
the
force
of
a
temptation
that
to
a
boy
born
and
reared
say
in
the
slums
would
have
been
overwhelming
now
considering
such
things
i
take
it
that
it
behooves
us
as
parents
to
look
closely
at
the
sort
of
persons
that
we
are
clear
inside
of
us
to
examine
as
if
with
the
clear
eyes
of
our
own
children
waiting
to
be
clouded
by
our
sophistries
the
motives
from
which
we
habitually
act
in
the
small
affairs
of
everyday
life
are
we
influenced
by
fear
of
what
the
neighbors
will
say
have
we
one
standard
of
courtesy
for
company
times
and
another
for
private
moments
if
so
why
are
we
about
trifles
are
we
truthful
in
spirit
as
well
as
in
letter
do
we
permit
ourselves
to
cheat
the
and
the
railroad
company
teaching
the
child
at
our
side
to
sit
low
that
he
may
ride
for
do
we
seek
justice
in
our
bargaining
or
are
we
sharp
and
do
we
practice
democracy
or
only
talk
it
and
wave
the
flag
at
it
and
so
on
with
a
hundred
other
questions
as
to
those
small
repeated
acts
which
springing
from
base
motives
may
put
our
unconscious
influence
with
our
children
in
the
already
of
the
scale
or
met
bravely
and
nobly
at
some
expense
of
convenience
may
help
to
enlighten
the
weight
of
inherited
evil
sometimes
i
wonder
how
much
of
what
we
call
inherited
evil
is
the
result
not
of
heredity
at
all
but
of
this
sort
of
unconscious
education
answers
to
questions
the
child
your
question
is
an
excellent
one
the
answer
to
it
is
really
contained
in
your
answer
to
the
question
about
obedience
if
a
child
obey
not
persons
and
is
steadily
shown
the
reasonableness
of
what
is
required
of
him
he
comes
to
trust
those
laws
and
to
trust
himself
when
he
is
conscious
of
obeying
but
in
addition
to
this
general
training
it
might
be
well
to
give
a
child
easy
work
to
do
work
well
within
his
ability
then
to
praise
him
for
performing
it
give
him
something
a
little
harder
but
still
within
his
reach
and
so
on
steadily
calling
on
him
for
greater
and
greater
effort
but
seeing
to
it
that
the
effort
is
not
too
great
and
that
it
bears
visible
fruit
he
should
never
be
allowed
to
be
discouraged
and
when
he
droops
over
his
work
some
strong
friendly
help
may
well
he
given
him
sensitive
conscientious
children
such
as
i
imagine
you
were
are
sometimes
overwhelmed
in
this
way
by
parents
quite
unconscious
of
the
pain
they
are
giving
by
assigning
tasks
that
are
beyond
the
strength
and
courage
of
the
young
toilers
at
the
same
time
much
might
be
done
by
training
the
attention
from
to
you
know
the
louis
fair
does
not
aim
to
show
what
has
been
done
but
things
are
done
so
a
child
so
you
can
find
happiness
and
intellectual
uplift
in
studying
the
laws
at
work
under
the
simplest
employment
instead
of
counting
the
number
of
things
company
ways
a
boy
who
is
visiting
us
is
so
beset
with
rules
and
even
by
glances
and
nudges
that
i
wonder
that
he
is
not
bewildered
and
rebellious
he
seems
good
and
pleasant
and
obedient
years
old
but
i
keep
wondering
why
perhaps
these
were
company
ways
inspired
by
an
on
his
mother
part
that
he
should
appear
well
oh
i
have
been
so
tempted
in
this
direction
for
of
course
people
look
at
my
children
to
see
if
they
prove
the
truth
of
my
teachings
and
as
they
are
vigorous
free
and
active
youngsters
with
decided
characteristics
they
often
do
the
most
unexpected
and
uncomfortable
things
there
must
be
good
points
both
in
the
boy
himself
the
boy
you
mention
and
in
his
training
which
offset
the
bad
effects
of
the
you
notice
and
possibly
the
nagging
itself
may
not
be
customary
when
he
is
at
home
and
perhaps
the
mother
knows
that
you
are
a
close
observer
of
children
theory
before
practice
there
is
only
one
danger
in
learning
about
the
training
of
children
in
advance
of
their
advent
and
that
is
the
danger
of
being
too
sure
of
ourselves
too
systematic
the
best
training
is
that
which
is
most
invisible
which
leaves
the
child
most
in
freedom
almost
the
whole
duty
of
mothers
is
to
provide
the
right
environment
and
then
just
love
and
enjoy
the
child
as
he
moves
and
grows
in
it
but
to
do
this
apparently
easy
thing
requires
so
much
simplicity
and
directness
of
vision
and
most
of
us
are
so
complex
and
confused
that
considerable
training
and
considerable
effort
are
required
to
put
us
into
the
right
attitude
for
myself
soon
after
i
took
my
kindergarten
training
which
i
did
with
three
babies
creeping
and
playing
about
the
schoolroom
i
read
george
meredith
of
richard
feveril
referred
to
on
part
i
and
felt
that
that
book
was
an
excellent
saving
me
in
the
nick
of
time
from
imposing
any
system
however
perfect
upon
my
children
perhaps
you
will
enjoy
reading
it
too
the
emotional
appeal
doing
right
from
love
of
parent
may
easily
become
too
strong
a
factor
and
too
much
reliance
may
be
placed
upon
it
there
are
few
dangers
in
child
training
more
real
than
the
danger
of
over
working
the
emotional
appeal
you
do
not
wish
your
child
to
form
the
habit
of
working
for
approval
do
you
the
food
question
the
food
question
can
be
met
in
less
direct
ways
with
your
young
baby
no
food
but
that
which
is
good
for
him
need
be
seen
it
is
seldom
good
to
have
so
young
a
child
come
to
the
family
table
it
is
better
he
would
have
his
own
meals
so
that
he
is
satisfied
with
proper
foods
before
the
other
appears
or
if
he
must
eat
when
you
do
let
him
have
a
little
low
table
to
himself
spread
with
his
own
pretty
little
dishes
and
his
own
chair
with
perhaps
a
doll
for
companion
or
playmate
from
this
level
he
can
not
see
or
be
tempted
by
the
viands
on
the
large
table
yet
if
his
table
is
near
your
chair
you
can
easily
reach
and
serve
him
it
is
a
real
torment
to
a
young
child
to
see
things
he
must
not
touch
or
eat
and
it
is
a
perfectly
unnecessary
source
of
trouble
my
four
children
ate
at
such
a
low
table
till
the
oldest
was
eight
years
old
when
he
was
promoted
to
our
table
and
the
others
followed
in
due
order
air
castles
what
a
wonderful
reader
you
were
as
a
child
and
certainly
the
books
you
mention
were
far
beyond
you
yet
i
can
not
quite
agree
that
the
habit
of
building
is
pernicious
indeed
i
believe
in
it
it
needs
only
to
be
balanced
by
practical
effort
directed
towards
furnishing
an
earthly
foundation
for
the
castle
build
then
as
high
and
splendid
as
you
like
and
love
them
so
hard
that
you
are
moved
to
lay
a
few
stones
on
the
solid
earth
as
a
beginning
of
a
more
substantial
structure
and
some
day
you
may
wake
to
find
some
of
your
castles
coming
true
those
practical
foundation
stones
underlying
a
tremendous
tower
of
idealism
have
a
genuine
magic
power
build
all
you
like
about
your
baby
for
instance
think
what
things
mary
pondered
in
her
heart
no
i
never
worried
about
idealism
except
when
it
is
contented
with
itself
and
makes
but
little
effort
at
outward
realization
but
the
fact
that
you
are
taking
this
course
proves
that
you
will
work
to
realize
your
ideals
i
do
think
it
very
bad
either
to
read
to
time
though
if
you
go
on
having
a
family
you
wo
have
any
time
to
kill
in
a
very
little
while
but
do
read
on
when
you
can
otherwise
you
may
be
shut
in
first
you
know
to
too
small
a
world
and
a
mother
needs
to
draw
her
own
nourishment
from
the
world
past
and
present
duty
to
oneself
yes
i
should
say
you
were
distinctly
precocious
and
that
you
are
almost
certainly
suffering
from
the
effects
of
that
early
brilliancy
but
the
degree
was
not
so
great
as
to
permanently
injure
you
especially
if
you
see
what
is
the
matter
and
guard
against
repeating
the
mistakes
of
your
parents
i
mean
that
you
can
now
treat
your
own
body
and
mind
and
nerves
as
you
wish
they
had
treated
them
pretend
that
you
are
your
own
little
child
and
deal
with
yourself
tenderly
and
gently
making
allowances
for
the
early
strain
to
which
you
were
subjected
so
few
of
us
american
women
with
our
alert
minds
and
our
puritanic
consciences
have
the
good
sense
and
to
refrain
from
driving
ourselves
and
if
as
often
happens
we
have
formed
the
bad
habit
early
in
life
reform
is
truly
difficult
but
not
impossible
we
can
get
the
good
of
our
disability
by
conscientiously
driving
home
the
principle
that
in
order
to
others
as
we
must
learn
to
ourselves
as
we
love
we
have
literally
no
right
to
be
unreasonably
exacting
toward
ourselves
but
perhaps
i
am
taking
too
much
upon
myself
by
preaching
outside
the
realm
of
child
study
the
mother
and
the
teacher
your
paper
has
been
intensely
interesting
to
me
i
have
always
held
that
a
true
teacher
was
really
a
mother
though
of
a
very
large
flock
just
as
a
true
mother
is
really
a
teacher
though
of
a
very
small
school
the
two
points
of
view
complete
each
other
and
i
doubt
if
either
mother
or
teacher
can
see
truly
without
the
other
they
tell
us
you
know
that
our
two
eyes
with
their
slight
divergence
of
position
are
necessary
to
make
us
see
things
as
having
more
than
one
side
and
the
mother
and
the
teacher
one
seeing
the
individual
child
the
other
the
child
as
the
member
of
the
race
need
each
other
to
see
the
child
as
the
complex
individual
he
really
is
in
your
school
do
you
manage
to
get
the
mothers
to
here
i
am
trying
to
get
near
my
children
teachers
they
try
too
but
it
is
not
altogether
easy
for
any
of
us
we
need
some
common
meeting
ground
some
neutral
activity
which
we
could
share
if
you
have
any
suggestions
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
them
of
course
i
visit
school
and
the
teachers
visit
me
and
we
are
friendly
in
an
arm
length
sort
of
fashion
that
is
largely
because
they
believe
in
corporal
punishment
and
practice
it
freely
and
it
is
hard
for
us
to
look
straight
at
each
other
over
this
disagreement
corporal
punishment
to
the
matron
of
a
girls
orphan
asylum
now
to
the
specific
questions
you
ask
my
answers
must
of
course
be
based
upon
general
principles
the
special
application
often
so
very
difficult
a
matter
must
be
left
to
you
to
begin
with
corporal
punishment
you
say
you
are
opposed
but
that
your
early
training
and
the
literal
interpretation
of
solomon
rod
keep
you
undecided
surely
your
own
comment
later
shows
that
part
at
least
of
the
influence
of
your
early
training
was
corporal
punishment
because
you
saw
and
felt
its
evils
in
yourself
such
early
training
may
have
made
you
unapt
in
thinking
of
other
means
of
discipline
but
it
can
hardly
have
made
you
think
of
corporal
punishment
as
and
how
can
anyone
take
solomon
rod
any
more
literally
than
she
does
the
savior
cross
we
are
bid
on
a
higher
authority
than
solomon
proverbs
to
take
up
our
cross
and
follow
him
this
we
all
interpret
figuratively
would
you
dream
for
instance
of
binding
heavy
crosses
of
wood
upon
the
backs
of
your
children
because
you
felt
yourselves
so
enjoined
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
scriptures
why
then
take
the
rod
literally
it
is
as
clearly
used
to
designate
any
form
of
orderly
discipline
as
the
cross
is
used
to
designate
endurance
of
necessary
sorrows
letter
killeth
but
the
spirit
maketh
alive
as
to
your
next
question
about
quick
results
i
must
recognize
that
you
are
in
a
most
difficult
position
for
not
the
best
conceivable
intentions
nor
the
highest
wisdom
can
make
the
unnatural
conditions
you
have
to
meet
as
good
as
natural
ones
in
any
asylum
many
purely
artificial
requirements
must
be
made
to
meet
the
artificial
situation
time
and
space
those
temporal
appearances
grow
to
be
menacing
monsters
take
to
themselves
the
chief
realities
nevertheless
far
as
you
are
you
surely
want
to
do
the
natural
right
unforced
thing
and
with
each
successful
effort
will
come
fresh
wisdom
and
fresh
strength
for
the
next
let
me
suggest
in
the
case
you
mention
of
insolence
that
three
practical
courses
are
open
to
you
one
to
send
or
lead
the
child
quietly
from
the
room
with
the
least
aggressiveness
possible
so
as
not
further
to
excite
her
opposition
and
to
keep
her
apart
from
the
rest
until
she
is
sufficiently
anxious
for
society
to
be
willing
to
make
an
effort
to
deserve
it
or
two
to
do
nothing
permitting
a
large
and
eloquent
silence
to
accentuate
the
rebellious
words
or
three
to
call
for
the
condemnation
of
the
child
mates
speaking
to
one
or
two
whose
response
you
are
sure
of
first
ask
each
one
present
for
a
expression
of
opinion
this
is
so
severe
a
punishment
that
it
ought
not
often
to
be
invoked
but
it
is
deadly
sure
stealing
the
question
of
honesty
is
indeed
most
difficult
i
do
not
think
it
would
lower
the
standard
of
morality
to
honesty
as
the
thing
you
expected
to
find
to
accept
almost
any
other
explanation
to
agree
with
the
whole
body
of
children
that
dishonesty
was
so
much
the
fault
of
dreadfully
poor
people
who
had
nothing
unless
they
stole
it
that
it
could
not
be
their
fault
who
had
so
much
could
be
the
fault
of
anyone
who
was
well
brought
up
as
they
were
emphasize
in
story
and
side
allusion
at
all
sorts
of
odd
moments
when
no
concrete
desire
called
away
the
children
minds
the
fact
that
honesty
is
to
be
expected
everywhere
except
among
terribly
unfortunate
people
of
course
assuming
that
they
with
their
good
shelter
and
good
schooling
are
among
the
fortunate
ones
then
you
will
give
each
child
not
only
plenty
of
everything
but
things
individualized
easily
distinguished
and
a
place
to
put
them
in
i
often
thought
that
the
habit
of
buying
things
wholesale
so
many
dolls
all
exactly
alike
so
many
yards
of
calico
for
dresses
all
exactly
alike
leads
in
institutions
like
yours
to
a
vague
conception
of
private
property
and
even
of
individuality
itself
if
some
room
could
be
allowed
for
free
choice
the
children
be
allowed
to
buy
their
own
calicoes
within
a
given
price
or
to
choose
the
trimmings
or
style
etc
i
feel
sure
the
result
would
be
a
sturdier
and
a
greater
sense
of
that
difference
between
individuals
which
needs
emphasizing
just
as
much
as
does
the
solidarity
of
individuals
