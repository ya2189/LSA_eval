preface
almost
exactly
two
years
ago
as
i
write
these
lines
the
famous
holzminden
tunnel
became
history
even
then
when
the
sordid
camp
was
still
lending
and
seemed
likely
to
lend
its
grey
colour
to
every
aspect
of
life
when
sense
of
proportion
was
practically
dormant
and
racial
animosity
intensified
to
the
highest
pitch
it
was
impossible
to
overlook
the
peculiar
dramatic
proprieties
of
the
event
some
day
it
was
felt
this
story
might
be
fittingly
told
and
in
the
retrospect
the
feeling
remains
unaltered
the
harsh
angles
have
softened
the
tumult
and
the
shouting
have
died
away
to
the
remoter
cells
of
memory
captain
niemeyer
of
the
reserve
has
knows
where
his
imperial
master
is
dragging
out
an
unhappy
old
age
in
exile
the
british
protagonists
and
in
the
struggle
have
scattered
to
the
ends
of
the
empire
on
their
lawful
occasions
once
in
a
blue
moon
perhaps
they
think
of
it
and
rub
their
eyes
the
details
are
already
vague
the
whole
of
their
prison
existence
seems
absurdly
far
away
but
it
is
in
the
hope
that
they
will
care
to
follow
with
not
uncritical
interest
the
following
plain
unvarnished
account
of
the
tunnel
episode
that
i
a
mere
have
sorted
out
the
threads
and
fitted
the
jumble
together
if
any
think
this
an
impertinence
may
i
plead
that
an
ordinary
stage
hand
may
see
more
of
the
workings
of
a
nine
months
run
than
the
star
performers
to
them
at
any
rate
protagonists
and
in
the
event
and
their
friends
and
relations
i
would
address
myself
particularly
through
them
alone
can
i
hope
to
interest
the
british
public
in
this
simple
tale
of
a
strategically
unimportant
but
highly
successful
in
germany
in
the
dog
days
of
i
am
indebted
to
one
friend
in
particular
for
assistance
in
the
true
description
of
the
actual
tunnel
he
prefers
to
remain
anonymous
many
others
of
my
have
helped
me
in
various
ways
the
design
which
is
reproduced
on
the

was

in

the
unwelcome
message
i
had
just
turned
in
the
fatal
three
downpour
which
had
set
in
on
the
july
and
had
upset
so
many
calculations
had
just
stopped
and
we
had
enjoyed
an
afternoon
and
evening
of
bright
sunshine
and
cloudless
skies
the
water
in
the
which
had
risen
steadily
in
spite
of
temporary
responses
to
our
efforts
with
an
old
trench
pump
and
a
chain
of
buckets
was
now
gradually
beginning
to
abate
and
the
stretcher
on
which
i
slept
was
once
more
high
and
dry
also
i
was
due
to
go
down
to
in
two
time
and
life
generally
was
taking
on
a
less
sombre
hue
it
could
afford
to
our
six
weeks
in
action
in
the
salient
had
been
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
almost
unrelieved
gloom
an
we
had
come
to
from
the
place
itself
one
had
come
to
realise
what
men
had
meant
who
in
earlier
days
on
the
all
was
said
to
be
quiet
at
trekked
south
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
remarked
that
was
better
than
the
now
we
had
seen
for
ourselves
it
had
not
merely
been
the
shelling
and
the
fact
that
there
was
not
a
really
safe
spot
except
in
the
very
ramparts
of
the
eastern
wall
themselves
between
belgian
battery
corner
and
the
front
line
it
had
not
merely
been
that
the
german
gunners
conveyed
the
impression
that
they
were
at
that
they
knew
exactly
where
you
were
and
that
they
were
doing
been
doing
it
all
as
a
pleasure
than
as
an
allotted
task
it
had
not
been
the
fact
that
no
fatigue
or
party
could
set
great
hopes
on
returning
scatheless
from
a
job
of
work
nor
that
here
hostile
aeroplane
observation
seemed
more
acute
than
in
other
parts
nor
again
that
rarely
a
night
passed
but
one
saw
or
heard
of
some
shambles
on
a
main
traffic
road
it
was
none
of
these
things
the
spirit
of
ypres
was
abroad
impregnating
those
new
to
her
from
the
very
morning
when
accompanying
a
harassed
jumpy
acting
on
his
round
of
battery
inspections
i
had
first
seen
her
i
had
felt
the
spell
upon
me
it
was
like
grey
skies
and
a
wind
in
the
east
the
quintessence
of
sombreness
the
intervals
of
quiet
could
not
be
called
peace
they
served
only
to
intensify
the
solitude
the
history
of
the
place
seemed
to
cast
its
stamp
on
those
who
sojourned
in
it
illustration
a
street
in
illustration
the
cloth
hall
in
illustration
the
menin
gate
of
we
had
come
into
action
at
the
beginning
of
july
our
instructions
had
been
to
get
and
camouflaged
and
registered
and
then
wait
for
day
and
that
waiting
had
been
sorely
trying
to
the
patience
it
had
been
far
worse
than
sitting
on
the
messines
ridge
in
june
we
had
been
told
we
should
be
but
we
had
fired
steadily
nevertheless
and
this
meant
of
course
more
ammunition
and
added
risk
of
casualties
amongst
horses
and
men
it
had
meant
having
the
men
out
of
cover
to
shift
the
shells
from
their
depôts
to
the
and
such
things
were
considerations
when
we
were
losing
men
at
the
rate
of
about
two
a
day
and
the
stock
of
capable
gunners
and
depleted
at
messines
was
beginning
to
run
dangerously
low
battery
on
our
immediate
right
had
had
an
even
worse
time
poor
old
they
were
always
getting
the
rough
of
it
since
courcelette
and
this
time
they
had
got
it
very
rough
indeed
they
had
had
no
cellar
to
put
their
in
and
we
had
been
unable
to
spare
them
a
share
in
ours
so
they
had
left
emergency
crews
at
the
guns
and
worked
them
by
nucleus
shifts
the
remainder
sleeping
a
long
way
behind
the
preparations
had
dragged
their
slow
course
along
and
we
had
gone
on
with
our
daily
routine
never
knowing
what
the
next
minute
was
not
going
to
produce
unloading
and
storing
the
ammunition
and
heaving
a
sigh
of
relief
when
the
last
had
discharged
his
daily
load
and
that
anxiety
at
least
was
off
our
shoulders
for
the
day
checking
the
sights
and
strengthening
so
far
as
we
could
the
pits
watching
and
shepherding
the
men
gassed
one
night
and
on
duty
all
the
next
and
then
gassed
again
the
deadly
mustard
fellow
had
just
made
his
costly
début
counting
the
leaden
hours
congratulating
ourselves
each
time
duty
made
the
door
afresh
and
ever
and
anon
looking
hopefully
through
the
tattered
screen
which
still
served
to
shield
our
part
of
the
menin
road
from
hostile
observation
to
where
passchendaele
church
stood
prominent
and
quite
intact
on
the
opposite
slope
in
five
weeks
the
corps
artillery
alone
had
lost
i
believe
the
figure
is
correct
officers
killed
wounded
or
gassed
and
other
ranks
also
had
lost
in
proportion
we
ourselves
had
lost
one
officer
gassed
almost
as
soon
as
we
had
got
in
five
out
of
our
six
and
twelve
gunners
or
bombardiers
had
had
a
young
officer
just
out
from
england
killed
with
a
sergeant
immediately
behind
our
own
guns
and
a
direct
hit
on
one
of
their
had
deprived
them
of
three
more
sergeants
and
two
gunners
at
one
fell
swoop
the
toll
had
mounted
up
steadily
and
though
the
had
issued
a
special
appreciation
of
the
bearing
of
the
artillery
in
these
difficult
circumstances
we
had
day
by
day
been
feeling
more
the
heavy
strain
then
had
come
the
last
days
of
july
all
the
conceivable
practice
barrages
had
been
fired
and
the
huns
made
wise
to
the
uttermost
then
rumours
that
the
french
were
two
days
storm
clouds
had
gathered
from
the
unfavourable
quarter
and
finally
on
the
july
the
great
unwieldy
barrage
had
unwound
its
complicated
length
in
drizzling
rain
on
the
hun
lines
the
infantry
had
gone
over
and
reached
the
up
to
scheduled
time
but
on
the
they
had
lost
when
the
barrage
advanced
again
they
had
been
late
to
follow
up
the
barrage
had
rolled
on
unheeding
our
men
floundering
in
its
wake
on
hopeless
ground
and
now
in
a
steady
downpour
had
had
to
come
back
and
consolidate
on
the
line
while
the
batteries
awaited
in
vain
the
order
to
advance
well
what
was
one
job
more
or
less
after
all
one
might
as
well
be
hung
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
and
i
should
go
down
to
with
all
the
clearer
conscience
on
the
and
sleep
how
i
would
sleep
i
would
get
down
there
for
lunch
if
i
could
have
a
quiet
ride
in
the
afternoon
into
and
come
back
to
for
an
early
dinner
and
bed
how
glorious
to
wake
up
once
more
and
to
hear
the
birds
twittering
outside
it
seemed
ages
ago
since
one
had
done
so
last
and
it
was
in
reality
just
eight
days
my
billet
was
in
a
small
madame
and
her
man
had
been
for
those
parts
friendly
enough
i
remembered
having
tried
to
convey
to
madame
that
next
time
i
visited
her
ypres
would
be
free
she
had
not
understood
and
perhaps
it
had
been
just
as
well

at

a
late
breakfast
after
a
in

open
air
a
leisurely
toilet
and
a
stroll
round
the
horses
and
then
perhaps
a
real
an
affair
towards
nieppe
forest
i
rang
up
the
battery
and
gave
my
orders
for
signallers
and
an
orderly
on
the
morrow
there
was
only
one
other
subaltern
available
for
the
job
and
as
the
major
was
out
at
the
time
i
deputed
myself
it
is
the
unwritten
rule
i
read
through
the
standing
orders
for
the
group
liaison
officers
finished
my
chapter
of
was
to
read
the
next
in
a
very
different
went
to
sleep
the
menin
road
was
a
populous
concern
in
those
days
and
the
varied
traffic
comforted
our
gregarious
souls
as
we
walked
down
at
a
round
pace
next
morning
after
breakfast
to
pay
our
respects
to
infantry
brigade
and
the
senior
artillery
liaison
officer
of
the
group
in
the
big
labyrinth
of
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
hell
fire
corner
though
still
occasionally
shelled
spec
was
no
longer
the
shunned
depressing
that
it
used
to
be
now
it
even
boasted
a
military
policeman
to
control
the
traffic
ambulance
cars
and
heavy
lorries
passed
and
met
us
the
road
was
thick
with
infantry
and
of
various
kinds
going
up
and
coming
out
the
shattered
boughs
and
fallen
branches
which
had
blocked
the
unused
road
before
had
now
been
only
dead
mules
and
horses
here
and
there
had
created
fresh
obstructions
fritz
was
putting
most
of
his
metal
this
morning
on
to
the
front
line
and
the
ridge
where
we
were
due
at
noon
but
even
back
here
he
had
guns
enough
to
send
over
his
one
a
minute
that
he
might
no
longer
some
of
his
old
favourite
spots
so
we
did
not
loiter
at
infantry
brigade
they
were
making
their
toilet
the
senior
liaison
officer
told
me
that
battalion
had
shifted
its
headquarters
during
the
night
hot
to
stay
where
it
he
gave
me
what
he
understood
were
the
map
of
their
new
abode
and
i
took
my
departure
we
crossed
the
old
no
land
passed
the
at
their
thankless
tasks
of
in
the
churned
morass
and
picked
our
way
warily
round
the
crater
lips
across
the
old
german
front
line
system
till
we
struck
the
railway
it
did
not
seem
to
be
getting
shelled
and
would
at
least
afford
better
going
than
if
we
plunged
through
the
direct
towards
the
front
line
my
intention
was
to
nurse
the
railway
for
a
mile
or
so
and
then
leaving
it
to
strike
across
up
the
ridge
in
order
to
hit
off
rectory
where
battalion
were
reported
to
be
i
had
not
been
forward
myself
since
the
show
it
was
worse
even
than
i
expected
the
ground
was
just
beginning
to
harden
in
the
hot
sunshine
but
every
hole
was
filled
with
water
and
one
had
to
plan
out
course
with
long
detours
jumping
precariously
from
island
to
island
the
rusted
wire
half
buried
in
the
loose
earth
tore
puttees
the
whole
place
stank
there
were
very
few
dead
about
the
hun
communiqué
had
probably
not
lied
in
saying
that
their
outposts
had
been
lightly
held
but
the
railway
embankment
gave
possible
lodgment
for
the
feet
and
we
kept
along
it
as
i
planned
with
six
paces
between
each
man
and
one
eye
on
the
falling
just
to
our
right
in
the
valley
the
effect
on
that
ground
was
only
local
and
we
had
no
fears
of
splinters
at
last
panting
and
thirsty
we
reached
the
crest
which
our
infantry
were
holding
we
could
see
no
movement
over
the
bleak
expanse
of
there
was
no
human
being
to
be
seen
one
had
got
to
cast
eye
right
back
to
where
the
were
a
line
of
ruined
houses
and
ran
along
the
ridge
one
of
them
was
i
went
into
it
there
was
a
concreted
cellar
facing
but
nobody
inside
it
i
hailed
a
red
cross
man
who
was
wandering
about
forlornly
he
seen
anyone
know
anything
it
was
rather
annoying
i
looked
up
my
book
of
the
rules
and
tried
a
cast
back
to
the
original
map
reference
for
battalion
headquarters
it
must
be
a
ruined
which
they
were
shelling
i
waited
till
there
was
a
pause
and
then
looked
inside
no
not
a
sign
of
anyone
confound
brigade
that
part
of
the
programme
must
wait
all
i
had
to
establish
connection
by
visual
with
our
brigade
signallers
at
hell
fire
corner
and
must
plant
my
lamp
we
went
down
into
one
of
the
on
the
ridge
and
deposited
the
gear
the
was
a
foot
or
more
deep
in
water
but
must
have
been
a
comfortable
secure
home
two
wounded
infantrymen
were
lying
on
the
bunks
on
one
side
of
the
they
told
me
they
had
been
there
since
the
first
day
untended
save
by
chance
arrivals
i
tried
to
cheer
them
up
and
we
offered
them
our
we
stuck
the
lamp
up
just
behind
the
on
the
top
of
a
bank
and
flashed
it
full
in
the
direction
of
hell
fire
corner
there
was
no
answer
going
right
i
thought
and
the
shells
were
pitching
just
to
our
right
and
inviting
retirement
to
the
beneath
us
but
i
was
overdue
and
had
not
found
sign
or
trace
of
the
infantry
the
place
might
be
deserted
for
all
the
world
save
for
our
little
party
i
had
one
more
cast
round
in
various
ruined
on
our
side
of
the
slope
and
then
made
up
my
mind
to
go
little
my
major
had
told
me
yesterday
that
our
fellows
were
digging
in
in
front
of
the
ridge
perhaps
the
infantry
colonel
was
with
them
it
did
not
seem
very
likely
on
the
forward
side
of
a
ridge
sloping
towards
hunland
but
unusual
things
were
done
in
those
days
of
disorganisation
and
i
had
not
seen
a
single
infantryman
since
we
left
the
behind
us
early
in
the
morning
our
infantry
if
they
were
not
a
myth
must
be
east
of
me
not
west
i
left
my
signallers
still
flashing
vainly
and
took
my
orderly
with
me
to
the
forward
slope
of
the
ridge
we
stalked
down
a
hedge
about
yards
then
turned
due
right
along
another
there
was
another
just
half
right
of
us
might
be
them
sir
said
my
orderly
we
swung
sharp
right
and
walked
up
to
it
i
saw
an
unusual
helmet
of
our
tommies
decking
himself
out
i
thought
then
another
helmet
of
the
same
sort
and
the
truth
flashed
on
me
just
as
it
was
too
late
and
we
were
within
a
few
paces
of
them
with
the
between
us
and
home
covered
by
a
couple
of
german
rifles
a
dozen
very
vivid
thoughts
raced
through
my
mind
made
the
most
awful
get
in
thunder
were
our
infantry
then
is
the
even
got
a
revolver
on
will
they
say
the
devil
they
say
i
gave
the
lad
an
order
and
we
held
up
our
hands
i
will
not
labour
the
apology
the
back
verandah
of
the
it
bristling
with
amazed
and
animated
huns
cut
off
from
retreat
unarmed
and
utterly
flabbergasted
what
would
you
i
stammered
out
a
few
words
in
bad
french
to
their
officer
and
then
asked
leave
to
sit
down
i
was
exhausted
and
quite
overwhelmed
so
this
was
the
result
of
my
fourteen
months
of
cumulative
experience
what
a
culmination
to
walk
over
no
land
on
a
in
broad
daylight
into
a
german
nest
such
a
thing
had
never
come
into
our
ken
that
i
could
remember
and
if
it
had
i
should
have
been
the
first
to
pass
uncharitable
comment
what
hideous
irony
i
looked
at
the
boy
i
had
led
unwittingly
into
captivity
what
sort
of
an
officer
did
think
i
was
now
he
would
bless
me
before
it
was
all
over
if
all
one
heard
had
read
of
was
true
suddenly
one
began
to
see
the
question
in
a
new
light
what
was
it
like
really
and
all
the
time
i
racked
and
racked
my
brains
to
think
whose
fault
it
was
where
the
mistake
had
lain
i
knew
the
range
on
the
map
to
rectory
which
i
had
just
left
and
the
range
of
our
barrage
three
hundred
yards
to
play
with
i
had
come
barely
a
hundred
perhaps
they
known
of
this
to
know
o
lord
if
only
to
i
footnote
i
did
learn
later
at
stralsund
camp
in
germany
where
i
met
the
colonel
i
was
then
trying
to
find
he
told
me
his
on
that
day
had
been
yards
of
rectory
which
they
had
found
too
hot
to
stay
in
that
day
seemed
an
eternity
in
the
evening
i
heard
the
shells
from
my
own
battery
come
whizzing
over
i
was
to
have
observed
them
five
rounds
of
battery
fire
on
the
german
front
line
at
since
the
push
this
had
been
the
only
method
except
by
visual
no
wires
had
lived
a
day
up
till
then
my
tie
alone
proclaimed
me
as
an
officer
i
had
left
my
tunic
and
all
my
impedimenta
notebooks
and
important
papers
in
the
on
the
ridge
the
orderly
in
his
rough
way
was
comforting
i
felt
sorry
for
the
boy
it
his
fault
anyway
one
had
an
early
insight
into
the
german
character
this
lot
were
mecklenburgers
and
good
stuff
by
the
look
of
them
but
desperately
dull
and
earnest
all
day
long
they
sat
in
that
officers
and
about
twenty
jabbered
there
a
laugh
there
even
the
semblance
of
a
smile
they
smoked
cigars
most
of
the
time
when
food
was
brought
they
gobbled
it
down
like
famished
wolves
and
then
turned
to
jabbering
and
smoking
once
more
occasionally
a
british
plane
caused
a
diversion
they
rushed
to
the
verandah
and
craned
their
necks
at
it
amidst
a
babel
of
maledictions
it
would
have
been
one
had
been
in
the
heart
for
see
the
way
these
fellows
took
their
war
they
were
perfectly
safe
and
knew
it
until
such
time
as
we
should
attack
again
the
must
have
been
sunk
a
yard
or
more
beneath
the
ground
and
had
five
feet
or
more
of
concrete
on
every
side
only
the
from
a
shell
pitching
in
their
back
of
a
direct
hit
from
a
heavy
have
done
much
harm
they
were
wonderfully
well
camouflaged
they
gave
me
something
to
drink
but
could
not
spare
any
food
and
i
smoked
a
cigar
or
two
when
it
got
dark
they
sent
us
down
under
an
escort
we
had
hardly
started
when
a
began
so
we
sat
in
another
and
listened
to
our
own
shells
falling
all
round
and
hitting
the
place
more
than
once
then
the
bombardment
died
away
and
we
went
on
our
the
swampy
hanebeek
past
batteries
and
groups
of
infantry
in
open
trenches
or
yet
other
into
company
headquarters
a
crowded
cellar
in
a
farm
where
a
brief
examination
of
our
guides
by
a
earnest
hun
officer
took
place
and
then
away
again
on
over
more
open
firmer
country
up
a
long
slope
by
a
narrow
with
our
shells
still
falling
at
intervals
round
about
and
fresh
corpses
of
men
and
horses
showing
where
our
guns
had
found
occasional
value
from
searching
tracks
whose
use
had
been
established
the
warning
of
our
surly
guide
became
rarer
we
emerged
at
length
on
to
a
regular
road
and
after
an
hour
or
walking
we
were
taken
into
the
roomy
and
laboriously
built
and
fortified
quarters
of
the
regimental
staff
there
more
depositions
were
taken
by
the
brigade
major
a
efficient
little
blackguard
i
thought
and
a
good
specimen
of
their
military
machine
cigars
were
provided
for
our
guides
and
we
were
marched
out
again
once
more
items
of
passing
interest
no
doubt
but
as
human
beings
inconsiderable
we
would
be
going
towards
moorslede
i
was
dead
tired
and
faint
with
hunger
but
the
cool
night
air
blew
fresh
upon
my
forehead
we
passed
ammunition
limbers
by
the
clumsy
things
they
seemed
after
our
neat
now
and
again
a
company
of
infantry
coming
up
to
the
line
at
the
rapid
half
run
half
walk
which
struck
one
so
strangely
after
our
own
measured
pace
they
seemed
to
be
in
high
spirits
and
had
a
cheery
word
for
our
guides
from
what
i
saw
the
german
flanders
army
went
up
cheerfully
enough
in
those
days
to
take
its
hammering
and
then
at
last
in
the
grey
dawn
and
after
many
questionings
of
by
our
somewhat
uncertain
guides
moorslede
and
a
brief
halt
in
a
headquarters
of
sorts
then
on
again
on
the
last
stage
beyond
now
and
every
german
had
enviously
said
to
us
who
could
speak
english
at
war
was
for
it
was
their
stock
phrase
and
i
believed
them
with
a
feeling
spite
of
all
the
it
was
so
and
that
i
should
at
least
given
reasonable
luck
see
home
and
friends
once
more

we
fare
in

at

the

almost
intolerable
that
fate
was
reserved
in
the

for
italians
with
the
usual
leavening
of
neglected
russians
accordingly
an
advance
party
of
the
and
of
schwarmstedt
packed
up
their
household
gods
and
suffered
themselves
to
be
transported
to
holzminden
they
were
told
authoritatively
that
this
was
going
to
be
merely
a
on
the
way
to
holland
and
exchange
so
they
threw

tins
at
the
starving
russians
who
were
remaining
behind
left
their
heavy
luggage
to
follow
after

stood
up

it
was
galling
after
having
been
led
to
believe
that
they
would
be
dining
at
the
hague
in
a
few
days
to
find
that
they
were
to
remain
prisoners
for
an
indefinite
period
in
a
camp
in
which
the
feeding
arrangements
were
to
put
it
mildly
as
yet
incompletely
organised
but
they
had
acted
unwisely
three
and
a
half
years
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
should
have
taught
them
better
than
to
travel
so
far
from
their

point

to
rely
on

until
they
were
actually
at

however
they
were
only

guard
the
main
party
from

had
yet
to
come
and
when
the
nakedness
of
the
land
and
the
bleakness
of
the
immediate
exchange
prospect
was
really
discovered
the
wires
were
set
in
motion
and
injunctions
passed
to
the
remainder
to
save
what
could
yet
be
saved
anything
edible
had
long
since
disappeared
down
the
throats
of
the
russians
and
would
in
any
case
have
been
difficult
to
reclaim
from
our
unfortunate
allies
but
other
things
of
less
immediate
value
were
salved
and
the
main
party
from
schwarmstedt
pulled
out
in
their
turn
from
the

resigned
at
least
to
a
temporary
stay
in

new

the
more
essential
things
it
was
a
regal
transport
there
were
of
them
not
to
mention
their
which
assumed
vast
proportions
since
everything
that
was

as

rolled
on
through

gate
into

on
him
than

was
the
accepted

so
taking

at

sat

down

dedicated
their

at

administration

chaotic

not
get
more

passive
resisters
satisfactorily
transplanted
from

place
to
another
without
considerable
difficulty

the
german
arrangements
at
holzminden
were
ludicrously
insufficient

were
incomplete

old
dodderer
of
about
seventy

left

tired
and
hungry
and
had
been
greeted
in
fluent
yank
beneath
the
flaring
electric
lamp
at
the
door
of
the
kommandantur
by
someone
whom
at
first
sight
and
sound
we
took
to
be
rather
a
genial
and
sympathetic
person
he
told
us
that
he
was
glad
to
see
us
that
he
was
always
glad
to
see
any
englishman
that
he
had
been
great
friends
with
the
english
himself
before
the
war
and
that
he
hoped
to
be
so
again
but
that
in
the
meanwhile
war
was
war
that
we
had
better
write
straight
away
to
our
friends
for
our
thickest
clothes
it
was
very
cold
here
in
winter
he
did
not
then
add
that
there
was
also
very
little
fuel
and
that
wood
was
going
to
cost
us
marks
a
pailful
he
concluded
his
speech
of
welcome
on
a
note
of
hospitality
which
made
us
think
of
bedroom
candles
and
a
comforting
now
yentlemen
i
expect
you
will
be
glad
to
go
to
your
bedrooms
i
will
wish
you
you
will
be
searched
in
the
we
crawled
upstairs
full
of
hope
and
were
sorted
out
into
three
of
the
upper
rooms
reserved
for
newcomers
there
was
nothing
to
eat
and
no
night
lingerie
to
slip
into
and
we
were
locked
in
because
we
had
not
been
searched
in
the
morning
we
appeared
again
empty
and
unshaven
for
the
search
our
kind
mentor
of
the
night
before
must
have
pierced
our
secret
for
almost
his
first
enquiry
was
whether
we
had
breakfasted
a
menial
was
then
despatched
to
bid
the
cook
provide
breakfast
for
the
with
all
despatch
and
we
solaced
our
impatience
with
unreasoned
thoughts
of
a
sizzling
rasher
or
at
least
some
breakfast
when
it
came
was
one
cup
each
of
coffee
and
lukewarm
at
that
but
the
genial
karl
pretended
not
to
understand
our
disgust
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
did
not
confine
his
innocent
pranks
to
the
newly
captured
all
was
fish
that
came
to
his
net
the
only
difference
was
that
he
got
so
little
change
out
of
those
who
knew
the
ropes
they
for
instance
might
have
guessed
what
german
version
meant
also
they
knew
their
rights
and
how
far
go
pretty
well
to
the
last
centimetre
so
be
it
added
did
he
it
was
one
thing
for
the
whole
camp
to
laugh
at
him
on
laughing
and
shouting
on
ripples
of
merriment
or
short
sharp
barks
from
the
entire
recognised
as
means
of
entering
effective
protest
when
the
germans
began
to
exceed
their
prerogatives
but
it
would
be
quite
another
thing
to
tell
niemeyer
to
his
face
to
shut
up
one
officer
did
this
and
was
promptly
marched
off
to
the
cells
these
two
had
waged
bitter
war
since
ströhen
days
and
the
englishman
had
renewed
the
offensive
by
openly
refusing
to
shake
hand
on
arrival
at
holzminden
it
was
natural
that
the
latter
should
get
back
on
him
as
soon
as
the
opportunity
arrived
holding
as
he
did
all
the
scoring
cards
niemeyer
never
went
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
trouble
on
the
contrary
he
welcomed
it
his
power
to
deal
with
the
situation
to
his
own
satisfaction
only
failed
when
as
sometimes
happened
his
temper
passed
completely
beyond
his
control
under
him
and
in
charge
of
kaserne
a
was
one
gröner
a
saturnine
sallow
fellow
reputed
a
schoolmaster
in
civil
life
and
from
all
appearances
a
worthy
exponent
of
kultur
by
the
schwarmstedt
lot
he
was
known
and
loathed
and
his
stomach
bulged
temptingly
as
he
stalked
on
to
our
and
there
was
ulrich
who
arrived
shortly
after
the
opening
of
the
camp
and
assumed
command
of
b
kaserne
and
its
two
hundred
and
fifty
inhabitants
ulrich
had
stopped
something
very
recently
in
the
passchendaele
fighting
and
was
generally
understood
to
be
the
at
all
events
no
brisker
or
jauntier
figure
was
to
be
seen
most
days
of
the
week
but
if
a
general
hove
in
sight
or
there
was
a
rumour
of
further
drastic
in
the
home
service
cadres
ulrich
forthwith
assumed
a
halt
and
gait
his
chest
caved
in
his
left
leg
lagged
behind
his
right
and
he
appeared
supremely
miserable
and
these
seizures
were
chronic
but
were
noticed
to
be
of
brief
duration
for
the
rest
ulrich
was
polite
but
a
doubtful
character
to
a
privileged
few
he
was
communicative
and
expressed
his
doubts
as
to
the
orthodoxy
of
the
conduct
of
prison
camps
in
the
xth
army
corps
but
his
billet
depended
on
his
keeping
in
with
the
authorities
he
was
a
case
for
the
front
and
he
had
a
wife
and
numerous
children
what
would
you
or
he
let
us
take
the
opportunity
to
introduce
the
rest
of
the
minor
characters
there
was
a
called
welman
who
the
sobriquet
of
the
he
had
never
been
to
the
front
was
reported
to
be
permanently
unfit
and
to
get
fifty
per
cent
of
the
profits
of
the
canteen
at
all
events
he
was
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
department
in
this
camp
and
was
credited
accordingly
with
a
snug
war
billet
he
was
not
discourteous
but
if
unduly
harassed
by
his
own
superiors
or
by
a
long
row
of
sneeringly
critical
english
he
became
excited
and
his
voice
used
to
sound
as
if
it
came
out
of
the
bridge
of
his
semitic
nose
he
spoke
vile
berlinese
and
was
generally
regarded
as
a
harmless
enough
little
soul
with
a
capacity
for
business
there
was
an
old
farmer
feldwebel
who
had
been
promised
his
discharge
months
since
and
loathed
his
present
job
he
never
made
an
enemy
among
the
english
in
the
camp
and
used
to
speak
broken
english
beaming
through
enormous
horn
spectacles
unfortunately
his
reign
did
not
last
long
either
his
discharge
came
or
he
was
regarded
by
the
authorities
as
too
mild
for
his
job
at
all
events
he
left
us
comparatively
early
and
there
were
other
gentlemen
feldwebels
who
construed
their
duties
too
humanely
for
the
taste
of
the
authorities
and
were
removed
and
one
or
two
who
gained
full
approbation
and
remained
to
add
to
the
gaiety
of
things
what
a
fate
to
have
the
charge
of
officers
in
a
prison
camp
theirs
was
not
an
enviable
lot
if
they
were
too
severe
they
forfeited
all
moral
control
over
us
if
they
were
too
complaisant
they
risked
losing
their
jobs
there
was
no
more
difficult
fence
on
which
to
sit
and
preserve
balance
a
more
doubtless
intrigued
by
the
idea
of
exercising
control
on
the
sacred
officer
class
on
most
it
weighed
as
an
irreconcileable
anomaly
one
little
fellow
mandelbrot
curiously
combined
respect
and
authority
in
his
behaviour
to
us
he
was
an
incorrigible
disciplinarian
and
never
allowed
any
liberties
but
if
he
had
to
address
a
british
officer
whatever
the
rank
he
would
click
his
heels
together
and
stand
to
attention
the
first
ten
days
at
holzminden
were
chaos
itself
even
niemeyer
was
unable
to
exert
himself
as
actively
inimical
in
the
complete
disorganisation
he
was
too
busily
engaged
in
strafing
his
own
staff
moreover
he
was
as
yet
only
camp
officer
the
doddering
old
commandant
still
reigned
and
time
was
largely
spent
in
interposing
his
unwelcome
oar
into
conversations
between
the
commandant
and
an
aggrieved
senior
british
officer
the
english
moreover
were
at
sixes
and
sevens
amongst
themselves
it
was
frankly
a
struggle
for
food
schwarmstedt
as
stated
had
brought
very
few
tins
we
from
baden
had
none
the
german
commissariat
was
of
course
execrable
there
was
no
or
relief
store
of
tins
and
food
for
such
as
had
been
instituted
in
the
prosperous
days
of
crefeld
and
gütersloh
when
the
odd
captives
straggled
in
from
the
battle
of
the
somme
and
found
plenty
awaiting
them
parcels
had
in
many
cases
been
already
countermanded
on
the
strength
of
the
holland
rumour
in
others
they
were
in
process
of
being
diverted
from
schwarmstedt
and
this
would
probably
be
a
matter
of
weeks
for
the
first
time
since
the
old
campaigners
were
casting
about
for
their
next
meal
it
was
a
new
experience
the
german
canteen
of
course
had
nothing
edible
for
sale
there
was
barely
fuel
enough
for
our
few
stoves
the
baths
were
not
yet
open
the
beds
were
hard
and
rocky
it
needed
but
a
brief
acquaintanceship
with
the
xth
corps
to
be
able
to
put
finger
on
the
et
origo
which
went
much
deeper
than
the
doddering
commandant
and
his
graceless
lieutenant
everything
that
was
unpleasant
in
our
new
surroundings
had
been
hatched
we
might
be
sure
at
from
the
brain
of
von
hänisch
the
fox
of
the
corps
now
von
hänisch
besides
being
by
nature
had
got
a
bad
hammering
from
the
english
on
the
somme
and
had
lost
many
men
and
his
field
command
into
the
bargain
and
now
with
a
third
or
so
of
the
british
officer
in
germany
under
his
amiable
tutelage
he
was
not
the
man
to
waste
any
time
in
getting
back
on
the
country
which
had
been
the
means
of
breaking
him
the
camp
was
not
ten
days
old
before
von
renard
took
a
preliminary
prowl
round
his
prize
covert
to
appraise
the
value
of
his
new
hunting
grounds
the
magic
word
went
forth
the
taps
were
turned
on
the
available
brooms
were
brought
forth
the
british
there
were
of
set
on
to
every
conceivable
form
of
fatigue
the
german
staff
worked
overtime
and
general
electricity
pervaded
the
place
and
amidst
the
general
preparations
the
senior
british
officer
girded
up
his
loins
for
a
battle
royal
and
noted
down
with
his
faithful
adjutant
a
long
list
of
complaints
it
is
the
next
day
some
time
after
morning
which
the
general
has
attended
and
which
has
passed
without
incident
the
senior
british
officer
the
better
to
forward
his
many
just
claims
has
ordered
a
punctiliously
correct
parade
from
room
on
the
second
floor
of
kaserne
a
we
may
get
a
good
view
of
the
interview
which
one
way
or
the
other
is
destined
to
fashion
our
existence
for
the
immediate
future
the
general
having
made
a
tour
of
the
camp
is
about
to
pass
through
the
gate
into
the
precincts
of
the
kommandantur
our
senior
officer
will
apply
for
an
interview
the
general
will
doubtless
unbend
so
far
as
to
go
through
the
form
of
one
he
is
surrounded
by
his
staff
as
well
as
by
the
old
camp
commandant
with
his
insufferable
camp
officer
the
paymaster
and
the
other
officers
attached
to
the
camp
they
are
grouped
respectfully
behind
their
chief
very
splendid
in
their
best
uniforms
and
stiff
as
pokers
every
now
and
again
he
turns
and
addresses
a
question
to
one
of
them
and
then
the
poker
back
grows
even
stiffer
and
the
gloved
hand
goes
up
to
the
peaked
cap
in
salute
and
stays
there
till
the
general
is
pleased
to
turn
away
again
how
we
used
to
loathe
this
german
habit
one
conceived
a
frantic
longing
to
tear
their
hands
forcibly
away
and
fasten
them
down
it
seemed
so
thoroughly
prussian
this
habit
of
talking
to
their
superiors
as
if
they
were
shading
their
eyes
from
the
sun
how
infinitely
better
our
own
brisk
method
seemed
than
this
apotheosis
the
interview
is
graciously
accorded
and
takes
place
on
the
bleak
patch
of
grass
graced
by
the
euphemistic
title
of
and
already
worn
bare
by
the
trampling
to
and
fro
of
pairs
of
feet
here
against
the
back
wall
of
the
squalid
across
one
of
the
dining
room
tables
symbol
of
conference
ringed
in
by
smug
supercilious
huns
and
with
the
eyes
of
his
own
countrymen
riveted
on
him
from
the
adjoining
barrack
our
senior
officer
joins
the
issue
it
exemplifies
the
scant
attention
which
has
been
paid
to
the
spokesman
of
the
british
community
that
the
interview
should
be
held
in
the
open
air
almost
as
an
afterthought
instead
of
as
it
should
properly
have
been
held
in
the
kommandantur
itself
the
senior
british
officer
has
no
enviable
task
but
he
has
at
least
the
armour
of
experience
and
knows
how
far
he
may
go
and
to
what
he
is
entitled
years
of
this
sort
of
since
first
taught
him
that
only
too
well
there
is
nothing
novel
to
him
in
this
interview
only
that
the
nature
of
the
hun
opposite
to
him
partakes
of
the
attributes
of
the
fox
rather
than
of
the
pig
and
that
he
has
if
possible
a
stiffer
job
in
prospect
than
ever
heretofore
and
one
which
he
would
gladly
delegate
it
is
no
sinecure
being
senior
officer
in
a
bad
german
prison
camp
stiffest
job
i
ever
took
on
in
my
life
a
veteran
of
both
the
boer
and
the
european
war
was
heard
to
say
once
have
never
known
a
position
where
one
weak
link
in
own
argument
one
single
individual
who
is
beyond
control
will
so
completely
crack
line
of
but
of
that
anon
for
the
present
we
will
follow
major
wyndham
at
his
uphill
task
as
the
interview
begins
he
trusts
to
his
own
moderate
german
rather
than
to
an
interpreter
and
speaks
direct
to
the
fox
who
listens
with
eyes
askance
and
a
sneer
on
his
face
the
first
complaint
is
the
building
accommodation
it
is
at
present
quite
inadequate
there
are
no
public
rooms
no
library
one
solitary
and
no
bathroom
when
are
these
going
to
be
allowed
please
the
general
confers
the
extra
and
the
bathroom
will
be
put
up
as
soon
as
possible
as
to
the
public
rooms
and
the
library
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
which
prescribes
for
these
they
have
been
permitted
in
other
camps
but
that
was
a
luxury
every
german
camp
in
england
has
at
least
one
public
room
it
is
well
may
be
but
england
is
not
germany
it
is
and
the
english
officers
must
learn
to
do
without
it
to
be
understood
that
this
is
a
camp
may
please
the
english
officers
to
understand
that
it
is
deserved
next
the
general
glances
at
his
watch
the
next
complaint
is
the
size
of
the
exercise
ground
it
is
too
small
to
admit
of
games
being
properly
played
there
is
plenty
of
room
if
the
general
will
permit
the
barbed
wire
fence
on
the
southern
side
to
be
moved
back
yards
it
will
not
encroach
on
the
allotments
and
a
corner
at
the
end
of
the
camp
might
also
with
advantage
be
put
inside
the
wire
this
is
a
reasonable
proposition
as
things
are
we
can
play
a
game
of
hockey
on
the
available
ground
one
game
of
hockey
will
not
go
far
amongst
and
there
is
no
necessity
for
the
curtailment
along
the
southern
side
of
the
ground
the
inner
wire
runs
parallel
to
the
outer
wall
but
full
yards
away
from
it
immediately
under
the
wall
are
the
allotments
of
the
camp
staff
there
is
a
space
yards
in
breadth
between
the
wire
and
the
allotments
why
should
we
not
have
this
one
can
do
a
lot
with
yards
on
a
hundred
stretch
in
a
prison
camp
but
knows
only
too
well
where
he
can
hit
us
on
the
raw
and
is
obdurate
perhaps
we
will
see
but
now
impossible
neither
can
the
gymnasium
at
the
end
or
any
of
the
ground
round
it
be
next
on
the
programme
comes
the
conduct
of
the
camp
officer
why
has
hauptmann
niemeyer
whose
behaviour
at
ströhen
camp
has
been
already
reported
to
and
strongly
condemned
by
the
war
office
been
again
placed
in
a
position
of
responsibility
in
so
large
a
camp
has
the
general
been
made
aware
of
his
previous
record
the
senior
british
officer
regrets
that
he
can
not
command
greater
fluency
as
he
makes
this
attack
if
he
succeeds
niemeyer
will
have
to
go
if
he
fails
it
will
be
war
to
the
knife
between
the
two
of
them
and
he
knows
it
but
the
general
has
already
prejudged
the
issue
and
our
major
might
just
as
well
have
saved
his
powder
niemeyer
has
been
standing
with
his
hand
at
the
peak
of
his
cap
for
three
minutes
gabbling
all
the
time
a
clever
man
can
get
quite
a
lot
of
into
three
minutes
he
will
stay
we
can
trust
him
for
that
the
general
beams
on
his
faithful
henchman
the
major
sees
that
it
is
hopeless
but
keeps
his
temper
and
carries
on
there
is
one
more
complaint
and
a
big
one
for
it
touches
honour
rather
than
comfort
it
is
on
the
delicate
subject
of
parole
now
it
should
be
explained
that
in
the
great
war
captivity
meant
confinement
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
term
and
the
roystering
days
at
verdun
in
the
napoleonic
wars
were
not
repeated
in
those
days
prisoners
on
parole
kept
their
private
apartments
their
carriages
and
their
mistresses
and
racketed
if
they
wished
long
as
they
kept
within
a
reasonable
and
elastic
their
content
in
the
great
war
it
was
the
wish
rightly
and
clearly
expressed
by
lord
grey
that
officers
should
use
the
privileges
of
parole
to
take
walks
outside
the
camp
only
when
they
could
not
get
sufficient
exercise
within
it
to
keep
themselves
fit
when
therefore
in
previous
camps
the
british
had
availed
themselves
of
this
privilege
they
had
been
in
the
habit
before
starting
on
the
walk
of
handing
in
a
signed
card
to
the
germans
on
which
it
was
stated
that
they
undertook
not
to
do
two
things
escape
or
in
any
way
to
facilitate
future
escape
or
to
damage
german
property
the
arrangement
had
proved
perfectly
satisfactory
but
at
holzminden
when
the
cards
were
produced
for
us
to
sign
there
was
a
whole
charter
of
other
things
that
we
must
or
might
not
do
when
we
went
out
for
walks
we
were
required
for
instance
to
sign
to
the
effect
that
we
would
unhesitatingly
obey
the
orders
of
the
german
officer
or
accompanying
us
this
hit
at
the
whole
basis
of
the
parole
idea
we
were
asked
to
append
our
names
underneath
a
clause
which
stated
that
we
that
the
breaking
of
our
parole
was
punishable
with
the
death
penalty
this
merely
insulted
our
intelligence
we
were
determined
that
we
would
either
take
walks
on
parole
on
the
terms
of
heretofore
or
not
take
them
at
all
this
spirit
of
dogged
conservatism
when
there
was
so
clearly
everything
to
lose
and
nothing
much
to
gain
might
seem
petty
and
unreasonable
were
it
not
remembered
firstly
that
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
our
parole
was
in
honour
bound
to
be
furiously
contested
and
secondly
that
if
in
the
course
of
business
you
conceded
the
german
an
inch
he
was
pretty
certain
shortly
to
make
overtures
for
a
mile
such
at
any
rate
is
the
opinion
of
the
senior
british
officer
as
he
now
bluntly
demands
the
quo
in
the
matter
of
parole
the
general
laughs
and
turns
to
his
escort
who
are
these
british
after
all
who
should
set
themselves
up
on
so
high
a
pedestal
it
is
known
that
their
parole
was
broken
at
schwarmstedt
in
the
spirit
if
not
actually
in
the
letter
the
major
asks
for
corroborative
detail
it
is
given
and
denied
roundly
the
high
and
mighty
kommandierende
does
not
lightly
brook
flat
contradiction
in
his
own
domain
and
begins
to
lose
his
temper
in
other
words
he
begins
to
shout
the
word
spat
out
so
that
all
can
hear
floats
up
to
our
upper
window
he
is
presumably
making
some
general
allegation
against
the
lost
british
sense
of
honour
neither
is
our
major
quite
so
cool
as
he
was
counters
there
is
no
further
any
attempt
at
concealment
and
the
fox
bares
his
teeth
in
a
snarl
every
englishman
in
this
command
he
storms
his
deserts
he
would
be
and
he
stalks
away
with
his
staff
in
a
white
heat
of
passion
the
senior
british
officer
sends
for
his
adjutant
and
an
order
goes
round
the
camp
that
all
parole
cards
will
be
torn
up
and
no
walks
will
take
place
until
an
apology
is
forthcoming

the
apology
took
months
to
come
it
took
weeks
only
to
report
the
full
circumstances
of
the
case
to
the
british
legation
in
holland
thence
to
the
dutch
minister
in
berlin
and
finally
to
the
kriegsministerium
itself
and
in
the

odd
british
officers
took
their
sole
exercise
in
the
slushy
compound
pounding
round
and
round
the
eternal
triangle
forbidden
to
play
games
and
longing
for
the
frost
which
would
at
least
enable
them
to
build
a
slide
and
on
the
evening
after
the
departure
a
groan
went
up
from
the
entire
as
the
interpreter
announced
the
fact
that
the
aged
commandant
had
taken
his
expected
departure
and
that
hauptmann
niemeyer
reigned
in
his
stead
chapter
ii
pinpricks
what
has
been
told
may
serve
as
a
prologue
the
curtain
at
holzminden
did
not
really
go
up
till
niemeyer
came
into
his
own
he
became
on
his
accession
even
more
truculent
than
hitherto
war
was
openly
declared
between
himself
and
the
senior
british
officer
the
cells
rapidly
filled
up
with
officers
whom
he
had
incarcerated
for
an
innocuous
stare
a
failure
to
salute
at
paces
distance
or
more
than
likely
for
no
reason
at
all
we
became
accustomed
to
the
sight
and
sound
of
this
gentle
knight
outside
our
kaserne
in
the
morning
about
a
quarter
to
eight
storming
up
and
down
in
a
black
gust
of
bilious
passion
harrying
british
officers
in
short
who
crossed
his
path
give
you
three
days
right
away
guess
you
know
i
am
the
commandant
and
similar
phrases
floated
up
to
us
as
we
lay
in
bed
half
asleep
and
warned
us
that
we
might
expect
a
visit
at
any
moment
sometimes
in
the
beginning
he
came
into
our
rooms
in
person
and
made
facetiously
offensive
remarks
to
our
unresponsive
forms
but
later
his
sense
of
dignity
deprived
us
of
the
pleasure
of
his
company
at
these
early
hours
and
he
preferred
to
prowl
about
outside
in
general
supervision
while
sentries
and
acting
to
orders
and
sheepish
or
blatant
according
to
their
natures
banged
upon
our
doors
and
with
a
raucous
contrived
as
a
rule
to
bring
back
reality
we
were
supposed
to
be
up
by
if
we
were
not
there
was
always
the
risk
that
one
of
the
sentries
might
interpret
his
duties
too
literally
and
pull
us
out
this
insult
was
of
quite
frequent
occurrence
and
it
resulted
as
may
be
supposed
in
friction
of
the
most
serious
kind
someone
would
probably
shout
down
at
niemeyer
in
the
enclosure
your
sentries
away
and
niemeyer
would
at
once
storm
his
way
up
to
have
a
personal
investigation
on
the
spot
the
hate
at
that
unseasonable
time
in
the
morning
could
be
very
direct
and
usually
resulted
in
the
commandant
bagging
a
brace
or
so
more
for
it
need
not
be
added
that
these
visits
aroused
intense
resentment
it
was
so
obvious
that
they
were
only
intended
to
annoy
the
pretext
was
that
we
were
so
habitually
late
on
the
the
answer
to
that
was
that
in
a
crowd
of
odd
a
great
many
would
be
late
at
any
be
it
fixed
for
or
or
even
let
those
who
were
late
take
their
chance
of
punishment
another
argument
advanced
by
niemeyer
was
that
according
to
the
regulations
every
room
had
to
be
swept
and
garnished
by
our
reply
was
that
they
always
were
our
own
orderlies
were
responsible
for
that
job
and
they
performed
it
when
they
were
not
called
away
from
their
own
task
on
a
german
fatigue
and
in
their
unavoidable
absence
we
cleaned
up
our
rooms
and
made
our
beds
ourselves
this
little
game
was
in
fact
no
more
than
one
of
a
series
of
pinpricks
taken
by
itself
we
could
have
made
light
of
it
but
the
snowball
of
pinpricks
gathered
weight
as
the
camp
got
under
weigh
and
niemeyer
grew
more
and
more
secure
in
his
position
niemeyer
succeeded
in
impregnating
the
entire
camp
with
an
atmosphere
of
acute
discontent
and
jumpiness
and
no
one
knew
this
better
than
himself
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
remarkably
fine
achievement
for
one
man
for
holzminden
might
have
been
from
the
start
a
happy
camp
the
air
was
good
the
view
was
good
the
buildings
were
waterproof
the
water
supply
was
good
only
the
commandant
was
vile
the
man
who
controlled
the
welfare
of
approximately
of
the
english
officers
at
this
time
in
germany
had
for
years
besmirched
by
his
presence
the
province
of
milwaukee
his
twin
brother
heinrich
of
clausthal
camp
in
the
same
command
boasted
a
similar
they
had
done
during
the
years
nobody
exactly
knew
the
brethren
were
practically
doubles
and
rivalled
each
other
in
the
calculated
arrogance
animosity
and
deceit
which
for
the
best
part
of
a
year
busied
a
thousand
souls
in
devising
suitable
punishments
for
the
estimable
pair
if
a
comparison
had
to
be
made
it
might
be
said
by
those
in
a
position
to
know
that
harry
was
the
worse
on
occasions
but
that
charlie
had
it
for
sheer
dogged
nastiness
in
any
case
there
was
not
much
in
it
it
was
a
concatenation
of
unfortunate
circumstances
that
two
of
such
a
breed
and
temper
happened
to
be
lying
idle
in
the
hanover
kennels
when
the
word
went
forth
for
a
general
british
strafe
in
the
xth
army
corps
it
was
always
understood
that
the
pair
had
weathered
a
search
on
the
high
seas
by
a
british
destroyer
when
crossing
over
from
america
to
the
service
of
their
beloved
fatherland
as
to
charles
it
was
reported
that
he
had
been
given
some
form
of
a
command
on
the
somme
but
had
lost
it
again
within
a
brief
period
he
was
certainly
fond
of
referring
in
no
uncertain
way
to
his
dreadful
experiences
in
that
was
if
anything
a
pretty
sure
indication
that
he
had
never
been
near
it
the
reason
for
the
high
favour
in
which
the
niemeyers
were
held
at
hanover
was
always
something
of
an
enigma
it
was
supposed
by
some
that
they
could
trace
their
patronage
to
even
higher
quarters
than
the
army
corps
commander
the
appointments
of
camp
commandants
we
were
once
told
by
a
friendly
dutchman
from
the
berlin
legation
were
in
the
giving
of
the
emperor
he
alone
could
make
and
unmake
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
this
particular
dutchman
was
lying
to
us
and
he
had
come
straight
from
the
hague
where
lord
newton
was
at
the
time
endeavouring
to
thrash
out
an
acceptable
exchange
agreement
with
the
german
representatives
certain
it
is
that
despite
the
strongest
representations
ever
since
the
departure
of
the
first
party
for
exchange
to
british
officers
to
the
british
general
commanding
in
that
country
from
the
general
to
the
war
office
from
the

office
back
again
to
the
british
legation
in
holland
from
the
legation
to
the
dutch
government
and
from
the
dutch
government
to
pair
stuck
like
leeches
and
retired
by
the
back
door
only
at
such
an
advanced
period
in
the
war
that
it
had
become
evident
that
not
even
the
patronage
of
the
all
highest
was
likely
to
avail
them
much
any
longer
if
true
it
is
an
index
of
the
system
but
most
of
us
were
sceptical
of
this
explanation
it
appeared
more
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
niemeyers
were
helping
hänisch
in
butter
from
our
parcels
and
getting
carte
blanche
as
a
pro
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
that
charles
used
to
steal
although
he
took
good
care
to
cover
his
tracks

niemeyer
used
to
wear
his
cap
at
a
rakish
angle
on
the
back
of
his
head
he
was
never
seen
out
of
his
prussian
military
greatcoat
except
during
a
severe
heat
wave
or
without
his
spurs
like
most
of
his
countrymen
he
carried
a
swelling
paunch
which
protruded
as
he
walked
or
stood
even
more
prominently
than
its
circumference
warranted
sometimes
he
carried
a
stick
but
more
usually
he
thrust
both
hands
deep
into
his
greatcoat
pockets
from
which
they
were
only
occasionally
withdrawn
to
return
a
salute
he
smoked
large
numbers
of
cigars
all
these
outward
characteristics
gave
him
a
most
plebeian
appearance
singularly
at
variance
with
that
of
the
usual
dapper
and
punctilious
regimental
officer

karl
his
voice
was
the
most
astounding
thing
about
him
it
was
really
a
most
delicately
modulated
instrument
capable
of
the
softest
and
most
sycophantic
coo
or
the
most
guttural
bellow
as
occasion
demanded
niemeyer
used
to
speak
his
native
tongue
extremely
fast
babbling
along
without
any
of
the
harsh
scraping
dissonances
that
one
usually
associated
with
it
and
quite
unintelligibly
to
the
ordinary
english
ear
his
english
was
simply
yank
extremely
fluent
within
certain
stock
limits
and
every
now
and
then
including
a
ludicrous
error
also
when
he
wished
it
suitably
foul
he
sometimes
made
absurd
mistakes
thus
he
would
say
will
have
you
arrested

price
the
enclitic

he
cherished
the
idea
that
represented
what
was
plain
and
unequivocal
an
index
to
the
methods
of
alien
saloon
managers
in
far
milwaukee
sometimes
when
a
grievance
involved
the
use
of
technical
english
beyond
his
range
he
would
blind
at
us
in
german
which
we
infinitely
preferred
as
it
gave
the
comedians
an
opportunity
for
looking
uncomprehendingly
asinine
and
shouting
in
chorus
which
infuriated
him
with
niemeyer
first
impressions
were
not
actually
unpleasing
as
he
had
clear
blue
eyes
and
a
voice
which
as
i
have
said
when
under
control
was
not
unmusical
new
arrivals
at
the
camp
unless
they
had
been
forewarned
or
had
had
previous
dealings
with
him
were
inclined
to
size
him
up
as
a
friendly
if
old
bounder
he
used
to
walk
about
with
a
retriever
puppy
which
was
a
source
of
considerable
annoyance
to
its
owner
as
it
was
invariably
on
better
terms
with
the
who
used
sometimes
to
feed
it
than
with
himself
the
only
occasions
on
which
he
was
ever
seen
to
stoop
was
when
bending
down
to
coax
the
puppy
to
follow
its
rightful
master
he
treated
his
dependants
as
beings
of
another
would
be
too
mild
a
term
for
niemeyer
was
quite
restrained
in
his
dealings
with
the
puppy
he
was
never
seen
to
return
his
salutes
he
only
returned
ours
as
the
result
of
frequent
protests
his
conduct
towards
the
british
orderlies
was
just
the
same
except
that
his
vituperation
had
to
be
done
in
english
and
with
therefore
more
limited
scope
to
the
british
officers
except
in
his
moods
of
berserker
fury
he
would
be
either
coldly
polite
or
else
offensively
as
the
mood
took
him
if
he
had
any
hobbies
we
did
not
hear
of
them
he
neither
walked
nor
rode
nor
indulged
in
any
sport
once
in
a
blue
moon
he
went
for
a
drive
he
was
a
bachelor
and
was
understood
to
loathe
the
sight
of
women
whether
he
drank
or
drugged
or
gambled
his
many
spare
hours
away
at
holzminden
is
not
known
we
did
not
certainly
identify
him
with
literary
tasks
the
knowledge
of
his
power
was
his
main
solace
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
often
stirred
up
trouble
in
the
camp
for
the
sake
of
trouble
to
some
such
motive
only
could
be
ascribed
his
relentlessly
literal
interpretation
of
the
corps
regulations
under
a
reasonable
régime
these
would
never
have
been
pressed
even
so
things
at
holzminden
would
have
gone
smoothly
enough
if
he
had
been
a
gentleman
it
was
the
fact
that
even
this
modest
provision
had
not
been
made
on
their
account
that
goaded
the
british
to
an
intense
intolerance
of
the
man
and
all
his
works
and
he
in
his
turn
looked
for
moral
support
to
the
authority
which
with
full
knowledge
had
placed
him
where
he
was
such
was
captain
of
the
reserve
karl
niemeyer
he
adopted
the
policy
of
alleviating
our
numerous
discomforts
only
by
slow
degrees
or
on
the
principle
of
two
steps
backward
for
each
one
forward
a
long
string
of
complaints
was
presented
to
him
on
the
average
about
twice
a
week
the
was
at
length
completed
and
the
camp
was
promptly
lodged
in
it
when
remonstrated
with
niemeyer
explained
that
there
was
at
present
no
room
for
the
accommodation
in
the
kommandantur
so
we
continued
for
another
of
us
at
least
who
could
not
face
an
icy
plunge
in
the
on
the
when
at
length
the
was
vacated
and
purged
it
was
found
that
only
two
of
the
showers
were
effective
somebody
broke
one
of
the
electric
lamps
in
the
compound
all
games
were
promptly
stopped
this
left
us
literally
with
no
outlet
for
exercise
except
the
monotonous
in
shorts
and
jersey
round
the
camp
enclosure
or
a
furtive
game
of
fives
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
long
corridors
for
which
it
was
not
always
easy
to
a
the
distribution
of
parcels
was
kept
in
the
hands
of
the
german
personnel
and
as
a
result
hopeless
chaos
and
congestion
reigned
in
all
previous
camps
the
british
had
efficiently
organised
the
distribution
of
their
own
parcels
no
light
task
in
the
days
when
supplies
from
home
were
unrationed
and
one
recipient
might
claim
as
many
as
twenty
parcels
in
a
week
when
the
consignments
diverted
from
other
camps
began
to
reach
holzminden
the
german
parcel
room
was
packed
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
the
accumulations
the
most
that
niemeyer
would
at
first
allow
in
the
nature
of
english
control
in
the
parcel
room
was
the
services
of
two
orderlies
the
presence
of
a
british
officer
in
the
parcel
room
even
on
parole
and
for
the
express
purpose
of
supervising
and
facilitating
delivery
was
only
permitted
when
all
other
attempts
to
cope
with
the
situation
had
failed
it
was
the
same
with
the
tin
rooms
and
here
a
word
of
explanation
is
required
when
a
in
germany
drew
his
parcel
from
home
he
might
not
strictly
speaking
merely
walk
off
with
it
under
his
arm
this
practice
was
winked
at
in
many
easy
camps
but
at
holzminden
it
was
rigidly
taboo
the
regulations
stipulated
that
every
article
should
be
strictly
censored
before
issue
it
was
not
enough
to
shake
a
tin
to
ascertain
its
nature
it
had
to
be
opened
by
a
german
and
its
contents
taken
delivery
of
in
a
plate
or
bowl
and
if
the
contents
were
solid
such
as
for
instance
a
tinned
ham
then
that
ham
had
to
be
cut
bisected
quartered
or
into
just
so
many
fragments
as
would
leave
no
room
for
doubt
that
a
compass
or
a
map
or
a
file
did
not
remain
concealed
a
ham
or
tongue
of
course
was
thus
ruined
the
german
employees
in
the
tin
room
loathed
this
desecration
almost
as
much
as
we
did
it
gave
them
additional
work
and
seemed
to
them
to
be
an
act
of
unreasoning
vandalism
poor
devils
some
of
them
were
honest
although
undoubtedly
some
stole
but
it
must
have
been
refined
torture
for
them
daily
to
sniff
elysium
and
lack
its
joy
daily
to
mutilate
such
as
they
had
not
tasted
for
months
and
months
daily
to
handle
forbidden
delights
but
they
had
to
do
it
for
they
never
knew
when
the
commandant
would
not
spring
a
surprise
visit
on
them
i
have
seen
him
take
out
a
penknife
on
such
occasions
and
hack
practically
into
mincemeat
a
tongue
which
had
been
left
comparatively
whole
full
of
zest
for
the
service
of
the
fatherland
and
threatening
dire
things
to
his
staff
if
ever
such
an
object
was
let
off
so
lightly
again
but
even
the
destruction
of
our
food
would
have
been
tolerable
if
we
could
have
got
at
it
with
reasonable
ease
unfortunately
the
inadequacy
of
the
arrangements
extended
to
the
cellars
where
the
tin
rooms
were
located
at
the
beginning
of
things
there
was
one
tin
room
for
the
requirements
of
the
whole
camp
the
tins
were
brought
down
from
the
parcel
room
in
wheelbarrows
and
piled
on
racks
in
the
tin
room
there
was
no
british
supervision
there
were
no
lockers
or
partitions
and
the
german
staff
could
not
read
or
understand
english
it
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
therefore
that
before
a
week
was
out
the
room
was
in
complete
confusion
accentuated
each
day
as
the
intake
exceeded
the
offtake
to
get
your
tins
opened
you
had
to
take
your
turn
in
a
queue
to
be
the
first
man
in
this
queue
it
was
necessary
as
a
rule
to
put
in
an
appearance
about
seven
in
the
morning
the
last
applicant
was
usually
served
just
before
evening
all
day
the
queue
crawled
it
was
a
case
of
or
missing
a
day
english
tins
or
german
rations
and
the
inner
man
won
the
head
of
the
queue
was
at
the
tin
room
door
the
rest
of
it
coiled
along
the
damp
passage
which
traversed
the
cellar
floor
it
sat
and
read
on
the
steps
of
the
staircase
that
led
down
to
the
passage
often
it
overflowed
right
into
and
out
of
the
doorway
of
the
kaserne
it
was
a
mournful
dispirited
queue
in
those
days
the
germans
took
five
or
ten
minutes
to
serve
each
man
and
it
was
even
odds
that
your
tins
be
there
and
if
you
were
very
unlucky
you
might
have
an
accident
with
your
tray
on
the
return
journey
upset
your
plates
and
have
to
begin
all
over
again
so
much
for
tins
but
even
so
the
toil
was
not
complete
supposing
that
you
had
emerged
weary
but
victorious
from
the
cellars
you
had
still
only
the
cold
and
raw
material
for
your
meal
the
urgent
corollary
was
to
get
this
cooked
and
to
do
so
it
was
necessary
to
fight
for
a
place
on
the
stoves
holzminden
at
that
time
boasted
three
cooking
stoves
with
surface
space
for
thirty
pots
including
kettles
and
a
purely
wood
fuel
supply
it
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
great
was
the
demand
and
so
slow
the
a
great
many
did
not
get
on
the
stoves
more
than
once
in
the
day
it
is
true
that
new
and
better
stoves
were
being
built
opposite
to
b
kaserne
but
they
were
not
yet
ready
for
the
moment
it
was
a
case
of
opportunism
watchfulness
forcefulness
if
necessary
and
devil
take
the
hindmost
sometimes
the
old
german
cook
would
take
part
of
the
overflow
on
to
his
own
capacious
stoves
in
the
german
and
so
ease
the
congestion
but
he
was
in
deadly
terror
all
the
time
that
he
would
be
seen
helping
us
from
the
kommandantur
and
he
expected
a
substantial
consideration
in
kind
for
the
risk
he
took
on
our
behalf
such
consideration
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
some
of
us
to
bestow
we
from
the
sorting
camps
were
feeling
the
pinch
about
now
and
were
living
most
of
us
and
apart
from
the
german
ration
on
precarious
charity
at
karlsruhe
we
had
blown
ourselves
out
on
tomatoes
and
bread
at
heidelberg
we
had
added
relish
to
the
bread
with
an
occasional
pot
of
honey
from
their
canteen
but
in
the
canteen
at
holzminden
there
was
nothing
to
eat
beyond
a
very
nauseous
paste
some
of
us
were
lucky
and
fell
in
with
a
mess
the
rest
of
us
waited
blankly
for
our
relief
parcels
eking
out
with
a
tin
here
and
a
tin
there
frying
bread
in
dripping
lucky
if
we
could
see
a
meal
ahead
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
we
knew
hunger
not
so
fiercely
as
our
successors
in
were
to
know
it
but
more
fiercely
perhaps
than
the
veterans
of
and
who
whatever
their
other
tortures
had
at
least
come
as
prisoners
into
a
country
where
food
was
to
be
had
for
the
purchasing
finally
there
was
the
question
of
fuel
it
was
october
now
and
the
days
in
brunswick
were
no
longer
balmy
each
of
our
to
hold
a
stove
but
there
was
nothing
to
put
in
the
stove
we
saw
woods
on
the
horizon
to
three
sides
of
us
the
regulations
we
understood
permitted
us
the
daily
ration
of
a
german
soldier
in
the
field
but
no
wood
was
forthcoming
except
what
was
brought
for
the
consumption
of
our
three
cooking
stoves
a
dangerous
minority
endeavoured
as
usual
to
destroy
the
comfort
of
the
community
by
stealing
this
cooking
supply
the
practice
was
sternly
stopped
then
recourse
was
had
to
the
stools
in
the
dining
rooms
these
blazed
well
for
a
night
or
two
but
were
naturally
not
replaced
and
we
had
all
the
fewer
stools
to
sit
upon
finally
those
who
preferred
a
blaze
to
a
rest
sacrificed
their
bed
boards
it
was
reckless
jettison
but
excusable
the
camp
commandant
had
broken
faith
with
us
over
the
fuel
question
if
possible
more
flagrantly
than
over
others
and
the
camp
was
justly
incensed
one
day
a
representative
of
the
dutch
legation
in
berlin
had
been
down
to
visit
us
on
the
morning
of
his
arrival
the
commandant
scenting
the
trouble
which
might
be
expected
on
this
as
on
other
issues
had
caused
it
to
be
proclaimed
at
morning
that
from
that
day
fuel
would
be
issued
free
loud
cheers
we
might
have
known
we
never
got
a
faggot
free
the
representative
carried
out
his
colourless
inspection
and
that
evening
we
were
as
cold
as
before
the
end
of
this
particular
campaign
was
that
ultimately
and
under
the
extreme
pressure
of
the
increasing
cold
we
paid
for
wood
at
the
rate
of
marks
a
cubic
metre
the
only
people
who
got
fuel
free
were
those
under
detention
in
the
cells
every
now
and
again
a
of
briquettes
used
to
come
in
under
escort
for
discharge
in
the
coal
cellars
of
kaserne
b
on
these
occasions
we
used
to
help
unloading
the
not
into
the
coal
cellars
a
crowd
of
officers
with
british
warms
and
trench
coats
with
capacious
pockets
suddenly
appeared
from
nowhere
swarmed
round
the
waggon
and
its
disconcerted
sentinel
and
contrived
to
get
a
bit
of
their
own
back
for
rank
exploitation
however
the
food
supply
was
we
might
forgive
the
germans
for
the
food
they
offered
us
we
could
not
forgive
them
either
for
the
way
they
served
it
or
for
the
price
they
made
us
pay
for
it
in
one
of
the
cellars
aforementioned
our
potato
supply
was
stored
this
came
in
in
october
three
english
orderlies
were
on
permanent
fatigue
in
this
cellar
peeling
the
daily
potato
ration
for
the
camp
when
the
peeling
was
complete
the
potatoes
were
thrown
into
one
of
the
two
large
coppers
in
the
german
the
other
contained
hot
water
and
were
boiled
up
in
relentless
conjunction
with
the
other
ingredients
billed
for
that
particular
day
it
did
not
matter
what
they
were
everything
went
into
the
and
so
long
as
it
eventually
boiled
and
was
ladled
out
into
big
pails
for
despatch
to
the
dining
rooms
all
was
well
on
sundays
there
was
an
occasional
lump
of
floating
in
the
stew
and
some
green
vegetable
which
might
fairly
be
classified
as
not
too
french
french
on
one
sunday
as
a
variation
the
skull
of
a
cow
complete
except
for
skin
and
ears
was
found
floating
in
the
pot
on
other
days
plain
or
its
equivalent
nastiness
occasionally
there
was
some
barley
grain
which
with
many
of
us
did
duty
as
porridge
for
our
next
breakfast
such
was
our
bill
of
fare
for
the
meal
our
breakfast
was
coffee
our
supper
was
an
attenuated
version
of
our
lunch
and
for
this
we
were
mulcted
monthly
to
the
tune
of
marks
a
head
no
doubt
this
charge
would
have
been
exceeded
if
it
had
been
possible
but
an
agreement
between
the
british
and
german
governments
had
fixed
the
sum
of
marks
as
the
limit
which
a
subaltern
might
receive
as
pay
whilst
in
captivity
and
the
germans
could
not
therefore
legally
charge
any
more
as
it
was
there
was
nothing
left
on
which
a
subaltern
might
come
and
go
for
ordinary
expenses
in
the
canteen
or
in
camp
subscriptions
and
to
meet
these
requirements
he
had
to
draw
a
cheque
on
his
bankers
which
was
discounted
with
a
neutral
agent
by
the
germans
at
a
ruinous
rate
of
exchange
for
himself
and
with
a
very
comfortable
margin
of
profit
for
everybody
else
concerned
no
one
of
course
who
could
live
on
his
own
supply
of
tins
thought
of
looking
at
the
german
food
it
was
too
impossibly
served
messes
would
sometimes
depute
one
of
their
members
to
make
a
dive
into
the
soup
tub
and
rescue
some
of
the
better
looking
potatoes
wherewith
to
supplement
the
evening
stew
the
poor
quality
of
the
diet
was
accepted
as
directly
attributable
to
the
beleaguered
state
of
germany
we
knew
that
the
sentries
and
the
staff
personnel
were
getting
the
same
and
that
probably
the
people
in
the
town
were
faring
little
better
what
we
did
resent
was
that
we
were
not
allowed
to
take
over
our
ration
in
bulk
and
exercise
control
as
to
the
manner
of
its
cooking
and
also
that
we
were
not
allowed
a
rebate
for
what
we
did
not
require
there
was
only
one
visible
means
of
the
whole
of
the
weekly
ration
of
boche
bread
and
as
scrupulously
wasting
it
or
burning
it
that
never
failed
to
create
a
commotion
and
it
was
made
before
very
long
a
punishable
offence
almost
weekly
the
messing
question
figured
prominently
on
the
agenda
for
the
senior
conference
with
the
commandant
weekly
the
same
privileges
were
of
the
raw
supply
supervision
in
the
kitchen
an
equivalent
return
in
money
for
what
we
did
not
require
weekly
the
commandant
returned
evasive
and
unsatisfactory
replies
and
shifted
the
onus
of
responsibility
on
to
convenient
and
distant
hanover
to
the
end
we
were
not
quite
sure
that
he
might
not
in
this
one
instance
be
really
telling
the
truth
the
messing
system
in
the
hanover
command
might
really
conceivably
be
directed
from
a
centralised
control
but
if
so
how
to
reconcile
our
system
with
that
at
clausthal
in
the
same
command
where
rebate
was
allowed
as
a
matter
of
course
later
on
damning
evidence
was
collected
to
prove
that
we
were
not
getting
more
than
of
our
scheduled
weight
as
a
sop
we
received
the
concession
of
getting
our
potatoes
in
their
jackets
on
two
days
in
the
week
there
is
little
doubt
in
the
retrospect
that
our
messing
at
holzminden
probably
afforded
the
easiest
field
for
exploitation
so
little
interest
was
taken
during
most
of
the
period
in
the
garbage
which
was
offered
us
and
so
regular
and
secure
was
the
payment
a
credit
from
our
own
unsuspecting
government
debited
automatically
against
us
in
our
account
before
we
had
even
the
opportunity
to
turn
it
into
as
the
paper
currency
of
the
camp
used
to
be
called
it
was
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
supply
branch
of
the
german
army
should
have
been
so
venal
the
opportunities
for
profiteering
must
have
been
unlimited
sometimes
a
used
to
come
round
on
inspection
and
sniff
the
mess
in
the
coppers
and
admire
the
stoves
with
him
in
close
attendance
one
probably
saw
the
people
who
were
really
getting
at
us
the
people
of
the
place
they
were
seedy
folk
thin
enough
in
spite
of
their
obvious
battening
at
our
expense
the
general
himself
was
a
fairly
poor
specimen
of
his
class
he
drove
up
to
the
camp
from
the
station
even
in
the
finest
weather
in
a
closed
carriage
and
behind
one
feeble
nag
he
was
obviously
zealously
misinformed
about
everything
and
our
quarrel
lay
not
with
him
any
more
than
we
should
have
visited
the
sins
of
an
quartermaster
on
the
shoulders
of
some
old
at
corps
later
on
in
we
heard
how
things
had
been
done
at
rastatt
in
baden
where
hundreds
of
british
officers
lay
all
day
on
their
beds
too
weak
to
move
for
weeks
on
end
there
too
where
the
stuff
that
we
spurned
would
have
been
a
banquet
the
fault
could
be
brought
home
to
the
criminal
maladministration
venality
and
neglect
of
the
ghouls
on
the
lower
rungs
of
the
staff
we
have
seen
the
half
ration
complained
but
no
explanation
friday
a
general
came
over
to
inspect
we
were
given
a
double
ration
for
dinner
saturday
half
ration
and
so
on
but
in
their
case
it
was
deliberate
cruelty
as
well
as
exploitation
chapter
iii
introducing
the
main
motif
such
in
brief
were
some
of
the
major
pinpricks
in
this
winter
of
our
discontent
needless
to
say
that
from
the
beginning
heads
had
been
put
together
to
discover
a
means
of
escape
the
camp
did
not
at
first
sight
appear
an
easy
one
to
get
out
of
but
before
we
had
been
there
a
month
seventeen
had
been
out
a
hole
was
made
in
the
passage
of
kaserne
a
at
the
end
next
to
the
kommandantur
and
through
this
parties
in
twos
and
threes
and
even
in
sixes
and
sevens
had
crept
walked
down
the
stairs
of
the
kommandantur
and
in
the
guise
of
german
sentries
under
an
made
their
exit
through
the
main
gate
when
the
first
party
got
of
names
were
answered
for
them
on
for
the
next
day
and
a
half
giving
them
two
full
start
this
was
the
more
creditable
performance
as
one
of
them
was
a
field
officer
and
as
such
paraded
on
with
the
few
other
officers
of
his
rank
in
the
camp
in
front
of
the
vulgar
herd
easy
to
be
seen
and
equally
easy
to
be
missed
unfortunately
luck
was
in
all
were
caught
before
they
reached
the
ems
and
were
brought
back
to
the
camp
the
passage
was
discovered
the
hole
was
filled
up
a
system
of
permit
cards
initiated
and
the
most
promising
escape
channel
in
the
camp
was
abandoned
as
being
no
longer
practicable
niemeyer
was
immensely
relieved
when
the
last
of
his
errant
lambs
was
brought
back
for
incarceration
he
had
had
his
lesson
and
profited
by
it
henceforth
the
english
should
be
allowed
no
rope
so
the
wire
was
heightened
and
a
no
land
was
created
round
the
enclosure
between
the
line
of
sentries
and
the
platz
wherein
it
was
death
to
walk
censoring
redoubled
in
vigilance
british
control
in
the
parcel
room
seemed
more
distant
an
event
than
ever
and
niemeyer
became
more
blatantly
cocksure
than
before
see
yentlemen
he
would
say
can
not
get
out
now
i
should
not
try
it
will
be
bad
for
your
and
in
reply
and
having
nothing
very
much
better
to
do
a
select
little
band
assumed
the
habits
and
characteristics
of
moles
and
started
on
the
long
task
which
was
to
result
in
convincing
niemeyer
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
that
where
there
is
a
will
there
is
also
somehow
and
somewhere
a
way
the
history
of
the
holzminden
tunnel
is
the
history
of
a
great
adventure
it
was
over
yards
in
length
and
it
took
nine
months
to
complete
it
was
dug
except
for
one
brief
period
in
the
hours
of
daylight
between
morning
and
evening
and
its
workers
in
order
to
reach
and
return
from
the
scene
of
their
labours
ran
daily
risks
of
being
identified
by
the
german
sentries
much
of
it
was
dug
through
layers
of
stones
all
of
it
was
dug
with
appliances
that
a
miner
would
have
scorned
during
all
its
long
travail
it
was
never
actually
this
though
the
camp
commandant
prided
himself
as
the
gaoler
in
the
fatherland
lastly
it
was
above
all
expectations
successful
and
in
a
way
which
satisfied
to
the
full
the
dramatic
proprieties
an
attempt
has
been
made
in
this
story
to
show
its
readers
something
of
holzminden
camp
as
it
was
not
because
it
bristled
with
barbarities
as
some
previous
accounts
of
it
might
have
led
credulous
people
to
believe
but
because
it
did
most
effectively
supply
a
suitable
background
to
the
tunnel
episode
a
background
of
grey
monotonous
imprisonment
of
minor
indignities
considerable
only
in
their
cumulative
effect
of
permanent
tension
of
seeming
unendingness
and
a
queer
depression
beyond
the
ordinary
all
who
were
there
will
testify
to
that
holzminden
even
in
its
lighter
moments
was
a
gloomier
camp
than
many
where
the
actual
conditions
were
infinitely
worse
the
secrets
of
the
tunnel
are
not
the
at
first
hand
he
did
not
personally
experience
its
dank
embrace
he
did
not
and
in
its
recesses
with
a
sense
of
intimate
proprietorship
in
fact
except
for
some
organising
assistance
on
the
actual
night
of
the
escape
he
had
nothing
actively
to
do
with
it
the
control
of
the
enterprise
rested
in
the
hands
of
a
select
few
who
were
known
as
the
and
on
whom
devolved
the
whole
responsibility
of
doing
the
job
and
seeing
that
it
was
done
in
secret
it
was
impossible
for
those
whose
business
it
was
to
keep
in
close
personal
touch
with
the
whole
community
to
remain
long
in
ignorance
of
the
identity
of
the
various
members
of
this
party
but
what
they
were
doing
how
or
exactly
where
they
were
doing
it
when
they
would
finish
doing
these
points
one
was
not
and
did
not
expect
to
be
enlightened
when
the
discussed
plans
they
did
so
behind
closed
doors
and
in
an
undertone
the
results
of
their
deliberations
were
communicated
to
those
whom
it
concerned
and
to
those
alone
once
the
shifts
had
been
arranged
there
was
no
need
for
a
member
of
the
party
to
do
more
than
be
in
his
appointed
place
at
the
appointed
time
and
carry
out
his
appointed
task
in
the
intervals
the
less
he
talked
the
better
it
was
only
when
the
scheme
was
nearing
its
maturity
and
when
it
became
desirable
to
let
a
favoured
few
into
the
secret
that
tongues
began
ever
so
circumspectly
to
wag
when
the
essay
became
an
event
and
the
tunnel
the
one
topic
of
conversation
through
the
be
it
said
through
hanover
as
was
possible
to
join
the
odd
ends
together
and
follow
the
whole
enterprise
through
in
the
retrospect
from
its
modest
beginning
to
its
glorious
conclusion
this
is
all
that
this
account
pretends
to
do
at
this
juncture
it
may
be
well
to
describe
the
premises
illustration
general
plan
of
holzminden
camp
scale
approx
inch
yards
the
two
kasernes
were
identical
in
structure
but
the
fact
that
the
near
end
of
kaserne
a
was
sacred
to
the
kommandantur
and
the
far
end
of
kaserne
b
was
set
apart
for
orderlies
gave
rise
to
some
more
or
less
improvised
alterations
in
the
internal
structure
here
it
should
be
mentioned
that
means
nearest
to
the
main
gate
as
you
walked
in
through
the
main
gate
the
kommandantur
lay
immediately
on
your
left
the
sentries
off
duty
sniggered
at
you
from
the
on
your
right
and
the
enclosure
through
another
inner
gate
directly
faced
you
the
portion
of
kaserne
a
set
apart
for
the
english
was
that
part
which
was
beyond
the
inner
gate
the
windows
of
the
nearest
room
to
the
gate
on
the
ground
floor
were
whitewashed
in
order
that
we
might
not
thereby
be
in
a
position
to
permit
cards
which
it
was
necessary
for
every
german
military
or
civilian
to
show
the
sentry
on
duty
before
being
permitted
to
pass
in
or
out
of
the
enclosure
this
regulation
was
a
safeguard
introduced
after
the
original
escapes
and
it
used
to
afford
some
amusement
on
one
occasion
a
sentry
having
been
duly
cautioned
as
to
his
orders
let
niemeyer
himself
through
without
asking
him
for
his
card
the
result
was
an
intensification
of
the
air
in
the
neighbourhood
for
a
good
five
minutes
and
loud
sounds
of
merriment
from
the
british
quarter
next
day
the
fellow
on
his
metal
stopped
a
hurry
the
sentry
said
very
little
niemeyer
said
a
very
great
deal
the
consequence
was
that
the
sentry
got
seven
days
for
his
pains
and
the
the
british
cooed
with
merriment
but
that
is
by
the
way
going
straight
on
down
the
main
thoroughfare
of
the
camp
you
reach
kaserne
b
about
yards
apart
from
kaserne
a
illustration
kaserne
kaserne
b
was
a
long
ugly
affair
with
an
entrance
doorway
and
a
flight
of
stairs
at
each
end
of
it
from
each
entrance
doorway
a
few
steps
brought
you
through
another
door
to
the
basement
the
distinction
between
these
doors
should
be
kept
clear
in
mind
on
the
outer
side
of
this
basement
corridor
looking
towards
the
uncommunicative
outer
wire
of
the
camp
were
the
punishment
cells
on
the
inner
side
were
the
various
tin
cellar
the
bread
cellar
the
store
cellar
the
potato
cellar
and
other
cellars
necessary
for
the
economic
administration
of
the
camp
half
way
down
the
basement
corridor
and
shutting
off
the
british
from
any
possibility
of
prying
into
the
cellars
at
its
far
end
was
a
partition
consisting
of
two
doors
usually
locked
the
near
entrance
door
was
the
entrance
the
far
door
the
entrance
going
through
a
swing
door
the
entrance
on
the
ground
floor
you
found
yourself
in
a
long
corridor
which
traversed
the
entire
length
of
the
building
and
connected
about
a
dozen
large
rooms
wherein
the
inhabitants
of
the
ground
floor
lived
slept
and
made
shift
generally
the
rooms
averaged
about
twelve
occupants
apiece
and
looked
out
on
to
the
inner
enclosure
side
the
lower
part
of
their
windows
had
to
be
kept
permanently
shut
even
in
the
daytime
a
source
of
contention
and
resentment
the
first
floor
was
the
counterpart
of
the
ground
floor
except
that
the
windows
might
be
opened
and
the
general
appearance
was
correspondingly
brighter
at
the
end
of
each
of
these
floors
were
the
rooms
which
opened
off
in
little
passages
or
saps
at
either
end
of
the
main
corridor
these
small
rooms
constituted
the
wings
of
the
main
building
which
was
constructed
after
the
pattern
and
in
the
proportions
of
an
e
minus
its
central
appendage
the
sketch
shows
this
clearly
enough
these
rooms
were
keenly
competed
for
they
held
three
to
four
occupants
each
and
the
actual
amount
of
cubic
space
per
occupant
was
less
in
them
if
anything
than
in
the
larger
ones
but
the
moral
effect
of
only
having
to
reckon
with
the
individual
proclivities
of
two
as
against
eleven
other
of
your
was
reckoned
as
an
inestimable
advantage
and
no
sooner
was
the
rumour
abroad
of
one
of
those
periodical
occasioned
by
the
departure
of
a
party
for
exchange
to
holland
or
elsewhere
than
the
house
room
was
besieged
by
a
crowd
of
applicants
and
their
backers
the
insistence
of
whose
claims
was
as
a
rule
in
exactly
inverse
proportion
to
their
merit
thus
a
who
is
being
strongly
run
for
the
billet
in
number
is
a
second
lieutenant
with
eight
experience
of
captivity
and
b
whose
inclusion
in
number
opposite
seems
no
less
essential
to
its
existing
occupants
is
a
flying
corps
captain
aged
not
yet
through
his
first
six
months
of
c
and
d
however
who
have
commanded
companies
on
the
somme
remain
unchampioned
and
unambitious
in
their
large
rooms
amidst
a
welter
of
disorder
discomfort
and
possibly
discord
and
have
to
be
prodded
into
admitting
that
they
mind
if
they
get
a
little
peace
now
and
again
it
is
the
way
of
the
world
footnote
at
holzminden
the
senior
british
officer
worked
through
a
personal
adjutant
known
as
the
camp
adjutant
who
handed
on
orders
to
officers
in
charge
of
each
kaserne
known
as
house
adjutants
on
the
second
floor
there
was
the
difference
that
two
large
dining
rooms
were
interspaced
between
the
living
rooms
dining
room
it
should
be
added
was
a
term
purely
of
courtesy
it
is
true
that
in
these
rooms
the
large
majority
of
officers
in
the
kaserne
stored
their
cooking
utensils
prepared
their
food
for
cooking
and
gulped
it
down
as
quickly
as
might
be
when
cooked
but
this
feature
of
the
rooms
was
not
stressed
and
they
were
used
in
turn
and
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
as
theatres
lecture
rooms
concert
rooms
reading
rooms
and
churches
on
saturday
nights
or
whenever
a
was
on
officers
were
requested
to
have
finished
their
dinner
by
six
dinner
over
the
cups
and
plates
were
dumped
in
a
convenient
corner
the
tables
were
pushed
up
together
to
one
end
of
the
room
to
form
a
solid
platform
and
in
an
incredibly
short
space
of
time
the
drop
scene
and
the
wings
were
hoisted
triumphantly
then
after
two
rapt
forgetfulness
of
the
surroundings
down
came
the
final
curtain
out
trooped
the
audience
and
back
the
tables
were
pushed
into
their
respective
sites
the
drill
was
clockwork
there
was
nothing
that
we
would
less
willingly
have
foregone
than
our
and
the
would
have
done
so
least
of
all
but
we
must
leave
the
dining
rooms
and
mount
the
stone
staircase
once
again
to
the
attic
floor
this
consisted
of
a
few
small
rooms
at
the
near
kommandantur
end
and
the
quarters
with
a
stout
wooden
partition
strengthened
with
sheet
iron
in
between
the
small
rooms
were
remarkable
only
for
their
extreme
cold
and
the
fact
that
one
of
them
played
a
highly
important
part
in
the
subsequent
proceedings
the
orderlies
occupied
the
farther
end
of
the
attic
floor
we
had
the
opportunity
of
inspecting
their
quarters
when
we
went
up
at
certain
fixed
times
to
the
baggage
room
which
was
at
that
end
of
the
passage
to
remove
under
the
surveillance
of
a
german
feldwebel
such
articles
as
we
might
require
from
our
heavy
luggage
to
do
so
we
of
course
used
the
further
staircase
this
was
supposed
to
be
the
only
occasion
on
which
the
officers
might
enter
the
building
by
the
further
doorway
to
check
irregularities
in
this
respect
a
sentry
was
always
placed
at
a
spot
outside
the
outer
wire
and
exactly
opposite
the
doorway
it
should
be
added
the
barrack
was
originally
far
ends
of
the
ground
first
and
second
floor
corridors
were
exact
replicas
of
the
near
ends
and
gave
directly
on
to
the
staircase
through
swing
doors
these
doors
had
at
the
outset
been
securely
boarded
up
early
in
the
history
of
the
camp
a
had
been
made
by
some
officers
through
the
boards
on
the
dining
room
floor
but
it
had
been
discovered
by
the
germans
who
were
now
on
their
guard
for
any
repetition
of
the
attempt
so
that
it
was
now
a
physical
impossibility
to
reach
the
quarters
or
their
staircase
by
any
other
means
than
walking
in
at
the
further
doorway
similarly
orderlies
could
not
reach
their
own
quarters
except
through
their
own
door
from
the
near
door
of
kaserne
a
the
kommandantur
door
to
the
far
door
of
kaserne
b
was
a
distance
of
some
or
yards
and
constituted
the
base
of
the
segment
formed
by
the
conformation
of
the
buildings
and
enclosure
the
arc
of
the
segment
was
represented
by
the
barbed
wire
fence
with
its
neutral
zone
which
ran
from
just
opposite
the
door
e
it
joined
the
outer
the
till
it
merged
in
the
parcel
room
and
guard
room
opposite
the
kommandantur
the
space
thus
enclosed
between
the
base
of
the
segment
and
the
arc
represented
the
gross
amount
of
outdoor
elbow
room
for
the
inmates
of
the
camp
and
measured
about
yards
round
the
net
available
space
was
much
less
one
german
and
two
english
a
square
potato
patch
a
wood
shed
horse
troughs
parallel
bars
and
a
cinder
path
running
inside
the
wire
were
factors
which
considerably
reduced
our
field
of
sport
just
behind
the
length
of
the
two
kasernes
ran
the
outer
barrier
barbed
wire
superimposed
on
iron
palings
five
or
six
inches
apart
with

on
the
inside
and
later
on
the
outside

well
the
whole
of
the
ground
directly
between
the
two
kasernes
and
again
between
them
and
the
outer
barrier
was
no
land
and
forbidden
to
the
british
if
you
looked
from
the
whitewashed
window
at
the
end
of
the
ground
floor
corridor
in
kaserne
b
you
saw
an
wall
between
you
and
freedom
this
wall
ran
at
right
angles
from
the
far
end
of
the
wired
palings
and
was
wired
on
top
there
was
a
sentry
permanently
posted
at
the
angle
on
the
inner
side
and
early
in
the
year
the
defence
was
further
strengthened
by
posting
an
additional
sentry
outside
this
fact
had
an
important
bearing
on
the
history
of
the
tunnel
the
wall
had
a
postern
gate
d
just
opposite
the
entrance
this
of
course
was
always
kept
locked
it
was
in
any
case
impossible
to
get
at
without
either
jumping
from
the
end
window
of
the
corridor
and
braving
no
land
or
cutting
the
wire
near
its
point
of
junction
with
the
end
of
the
building

the
door
chapter

such
in

were
the
precautions
of
the

for

safe
custody
bolted

wire

an
encircling
belt

an
absence
of
any
ground
that
could
by
a
stretch
of
imagination
be
termed
police
dogs
and
night
patrols
and
withal
a
very
formidable
cordon
of
sentries
both
within
and
subsequently
without
the
camp
it
was
not
an
easy
nut
to
crack
by
the
overland
route
after
the
original
mode
of
the
kommandantur
in
house
and
out
through
the
main
become
known
and
therefore
obsolete
more
direct
methods
were
practised
with
in
many
cases
great
bravery
and
ingenuity
but
in
all
a
regrettable
absence
of
success
three
of
these
escapades
are
perhaps
deserving
of
especial
mention
illustration
scene
of
the
illustration
a
at
the
first
of
these
will
always
be
regarded
by
those
who
saw
it
or
knew
of
it
as
the
bravest
and
at
the
same
time
the
coolest
exploit
of
their
prison
experience
both
the
officers
who
performed
it
were
subsequently
an
attempt
it
was
said
to
break
away
from
their
guards
after
recapture
following
an
escape
from
bad
kolberg
unfortunately
the
english
version
of
that
story
will
never
be
known
and
the
sworn
evidence
of
the
the
british
officers
after
being
delivered
over
to
their
escort
and
in
spite
of
the
most
stringent
warnings
broke
away
and
were
mortally
wounded
in
doing
even
if
it
be
true
cold
comfort
to
their
friends
it
was
the
custom
that
an
attempt
to
escape
if
resulting
in
capture
involved
automatic
transfer
to
another
camp
and
of
both
medlicott
and
walter
the
heroes
of
this
exploit
it
can
be
safely
said
that
neither
of
them
ever
stayed
anywhere
in
germany
long
enough
to
worry
about
making
themselves
comfortable
truly
a
proud
record
footnote
to
lieutenant
fitzgerald
of
the
australian
flying
corps
and
his
either
of
them
should
read
apologies
they
were
the
first
men
out
from
kaserne
b
at
holzminden
cutting
the
wire
opposite
the
entrance
in
broad
daylight
and
getting
as
far
as
munster
in
before
recapture
but
unfortunately
i
do
not
know
any
further
details
of
their
escapade
on
a
sunday
afternoon
in
march
the
usual
sort
of
things
were
happening
there
was
the
usual
small
knot
of
people
round
the
stoves
in
the
kaserne
b
there
were
the
usual
few
taking
their
afternoon
constitutional
up
and
down
on
the
cobbles
or
round
and
round
on
the
cinder
there
was
the
usual
bored
sentry
moving
up
and
down
on
his
particular
beat
in
no
land
in
the
stretch
between
the
two
kasernes
except
to
the
favoured
few
in
the
secret
there
was
the
usual
complete
absence
of
life
or
interest
in
the
sombre
enclosure
from
the
shadow
of
the
two
officers
wearing
civilian
disguise
and
carrying
bulging
rucksacks
walked
steadily
over
the
cobbled
track
through
the
plain
wire
fence
across
no
land
and
up
to
the
wired
railings
which
formed
the
northern
boundary
of
the
camp
and
which
can
be
seen
in
the
left
of
the
photograph
those
who
were
there
to
see
them
gave
one
gasp
of
amazement
and
then
directed
an
agonized
look
in
the
direction
of
the
sentry
he
was
nearing
the
lee
of
kaserne
a
still
on
the
outward
portion
of
his
beat
and
was
not
due
to
turn
for
another
fifteen
seconds
or
so
they
pushed
their
packs
through
the
interstices
of
the
palings
on
to
the
road
walter
shinned
up
the
palings
cut
the
strands
of
barbed
wire
threw
back
the
cutters
to
accomplices
waiting
in
the
enclosure
and
dropped
into
the
road
medlicott
followed
then
they
assumed
their
packs
and
pulled
out
their
civilian
hats
as
the
sentry
turned
on
his
beat
two
unassuming
pedestrians
were
to
be
seen
walking
up
the
road
which
ran
parallel
to
the
camp
towards
the
railway
crossing
and
the
fortune
so
far
had
favoured
this
amazing
and
wonderfully
calculated
scheme
worked
out
literally
in
terms
of
seconds
the
sentry
at
the
far
corner
of
kaserne
b
had
also
clearly
suspected
nothing
doubtless
his
beat
had
been
as
carefully
observed
and
timed
as
that
of
the
other
and
the
conclusion
arrived
at
that
for
a
given
number
of
seconds
the
whole
length
of
that
particular
side
of
the
camp
would
probably
not
be
under
german
observation
neither
would
it
have
been
but
for
a
coincidence
against
which
no
calculations
or
precautions
could
have
been
proof
the
german
cell
decent
little
man
in
his
way
but
very
much
on
such
an
occasion
as
to
be
looking
out
of
one
of
the
kaserne
b
cell
windows
which
gave
upon
the
road
and
recognised
both
walter
and
medlicott
who
had
only
just
completed
the
sentence
of
confinement
incurred
for
their
last
escape
he
rushed
upstairs
and
gave
the
alarm
the
fugitives
who
were
by
then
only
a
few
yards
clear
of
the
camp
realised
that
something
unforeseen
had
marred
their
plan
and
that
they
must
run
for
it
in
broad
daylight
and
with
a
hue
and
cry
in
their
rear
they
stood
but
the
slenderest
chance
of
making
cover
in
the
woods
to
reach
which
they
had
first
to
cross
the
railway
it
being
sunday
afternoon
there
was
more
than
the
usual
traffic
on
the
road
and
round
the
adjoining
fields
cut
off
their
one
avenue
of
escape
the
more
custodian
of
the
level
crossing
had
received
a
prompt
warning
from
the
kommandantur
by
telephone
as
to
what
he
might
expect
and
he
now
stood
in
the
path
of
the
fugitives
with
a
loaded
gun
so
the
game
was
up
and
the
brave
pair
were
brought
back
amidst
sympathetic
cheers
from
the
windows
of
kaserne
b
the
cell
attendant
got
three
leave
on
the
nail
and
niemeyer
glowing
with
patriotic
fervour
and
pride
at
his
still
unblemished
record
allowed
one
of
his
sentries
to
shoot
without
the
veriest
shadow
of
justification
at
one
of
the
crowded
windows
of
kaserne
fortunately
no
one
was
hurt
either
by
the
bullet
or
the
broken
glass
but
for
the
second
time
in
the
history
of
the
camp
a
court
of
enquiry
sat
to
examine
into
a
charge
of
manslaughter
attempted
without
any
provocation
the
findings
of
this
court
were
ultimately
themselves
found
by
the
germans
during
a
search
and
promptly
confiscated
another
attempt
to
escape
partook
of
the
there
had
been
introduced
one
day
into
kaserne
b
a
length
of
timber
intended
by
the
authorities
to
serve
as
a
framework
for
messing
cupboards
in
one
of
the
dining
rooms
this
timber
was
however
promptly
earmarked
for
a
purpose
more
directly
in
the
interests
of
the
allied
cause
a
certain
beardless
professor
of
astronomy
who
had
lectured
to
us
the
previous
sunday
on
the
wonders
of
the
moon
and
stars
conceived
the
idea
of
projecting
himself
on
this
length
of
timber
from
one
of
the
corridor
windows
of
the
first
floor
on
to
the
wire
of
the
palisade
and
thence
to
the
road
beyond
the
timber
was
be
just
long
enough
to
rest
on
the
wire
his
idea
was
to
get
himself
pushed
out
on
the
plank
on
a
sufficiently
dark
night
and
when
the
wire
was
reached
jump
for
it
three
miles
of
the
cresta
run
could
not
equal
this
little
journey
for
condensed
excitement
but
unfortunately
though
it
was
a
dark
night
and
the
stage
was
well
set
for
the
adventure
the
accomplices
pushed
too
hard
and
the
extemporised
the
flying
into
space
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
wire
to
the
intense
alarm
of
the
nearest
sentry
next
morning
the
dining
room
was
locked
on
the
ground
that
it
had
been
put
to
improper
use
thereupon
several
hungry
men
who
wanted
to
get
at
their
battered
in
the
door
with
stools
niemeyer
retaliated
by
locking
the
whole
of
the
barrack
up
within
the
kaserne
for
hours
this
was
a
good
example
of
the
collective
punishments
which
used
so
often
to
be
applied
in
prison
camps
under
the
rules
of
the
hague
convention
embodied
unfortunately
in
our
own
manual
of
military
law
they
were
futile
served
no
effective
or
precautionary
end
and
succeeded
merely
in
rousing
even
in
the
more
stolid
the
most
bitter
feelings
of
personal
antagonism
it
need
not
be
added
that
such
intervals
were
infinitely
more
to
taste
than
were
the
humdrum
periods
of
chronic
dislike
and
discontent
fostered
under
his
genial
charge
in
this
particular
instance
the
siege
was
lifted
after
hours
a
draft
letter
to
the
asking
in
plain
german
whether
as
the
result
of
one
officer
attempting
to
escape
the
remaining
officers
were
to
be
denied
access
to
their
food
was
presented
to
the
commandant
niemeyer
saw
that
he
had
gone
far
enough
arranged
to
parley
and
eventually
capitulated
an
active
boycott
of
the
canteen
in
a
kaserne
may
also
possibly
have
hastened
his
resolution
to
the
end
we
never
discovered
the
degree
of
pecuniary
interest
which
niemeyer
exercised
in
the
profits
of
the
fairly
considerable
he
at
all
events
never
let
a
chance
slip
of
attesting
before
all
and
sundry
that
he
was
out
of
pocket
on
it
there
was
one
other
very
clever
attempt
made
about
this
only
occasion
besides
the
affair
on
which
the
wire
was
successfully
cut
and
negotiated
in
broad
daylight
this
again
was
the
result
of
minute
observation
and
carefully
timed
and
cool
action
and
the
cause
of
its
failure
could
have
been
as
little
foreseen
the
performers
in
this
attempt
were
captain
strover
indian
army
lieutenant
bousfield
royal
engineers
and
lieutenant
nichol
they
chose
what
was
perhaps
the
weakest
spot
in
the
cordon
of
behind
the
parcel
room
the
back
of
the
parcel
strictly
out
of
bounds
except
during
receiving
closely
on
to
the
outer
wire
which
consisted
of
wire
netting
at
the
bottom
and
barbed
strands
on
top
to
a
height
of
eight
feet
once
through
this
and
provided
you
had
not
been
observed
it
was
only
necessary
to
walk
airily
through
the
married
quarters
out
of
an
open
gate
and
into
the
suburbs
of
holzminden
town
the
three
managed
to
secrete
themselves
in
the
parcel
room
till
about
when
the
german
personnel
betook
itself
to
the
most
important
task
of
the
hours
then
with
extreme
skill
and
presence
of
mind
an
aperture
in
the
wire
netting
was
made
to
admit
of
the
passage
of
their
persons
and
packs
and
was
closed
behind
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
no
trace
except
upon
minute
observation
that
the
wire
had
been
tampered
with
at
all
the
solitary
sentry
on
that
particular
beat
saw
nothing
and
they
walked
unchallenged
into
holzminden
intending
to
cross
the
weser
at
the
town
bridge
and
make
for
holland
but
at
a
street
corner
they
came
face
to
face
with
one
of
the
tin
room
attendants
of
the
camp
who
knew
strover
by
sight
he
allowed
them
to
pass
unchallenged
but
a
little
later
obviously
thought
better
of
it
and
from
that
moment
they
were
aware
that
their
footsteps
were
being
dogged
they
hurried
on
as
fast
as
was
possible
but
the
game
was
up
in
an
incredibly
short
time
so
it
seemed
the
whole
of
holzminden
was
following
them
as
the
children
of
hamelin
further
down
the
weser
once
followed
the
pied
piper
and
after
one
attempt
to
disarm
suspicion
by
a
mild
ist
los
up
most
appropriate
german
remark
under
the
chucked
their
hand
in
and
acknowledged
defeat
it
was
a
striking
tribute
to
the
skilful
nature
of
this
escape
that
the
hole
in
the
wire
was
not
discovered
in
spite
of
the
most
elaborate
search
till
several
hours
later
many
other
attempts
were
made
but
they
were
in
disaster
before
the
wire
was
reached
they
were
made
usually
at
night
and
we
would
be
awakened
out
of
our
beauty
sleep
by
shouts
and
tramplings
alarums
and
excursions
a
mild
barrage
of
rifle
shots
the
flash
of
a
torchlight
on
to
our
beds
by
a
harassed
feldwebel
conducting
an
emergency
and
general
vituperation
after
the
manner
of
the
best
disciplined
army
in
the
world
one
bright
spirit
conceived
the
idea
of
parachuting
himself
on
a
windy
night
with
an
improvised
umbrella
from
the
top
floor
but
either
the
wind
never
reached
the
required
velocity
or
else
his
before
the
sticking
point
two
others
tried
to
be
conveyed
out
of
the
camp
gates
in
the
muck
cart
which
cleared
the
camp
refuse
once
in
every
week
the
british
orderlies
on
this
fatigue
were
let
into
the
secret
and
as
soon
as
the
two
officers
had
crept
unperceived
by
the
german
sentry
into
the
well
of
the
cart
they
were
engaged
to
shovel
on
to
and
over
them
the
whole
of
the
unsavoury
contents
of
the
refuse
bin
it
was
a
sporting
venture
to
sit
possibly
for
hours
at
the
bottom
of
a
heap
of
decayed
food
lees
of
tea
used
tins
and
discarded
on
the
of
being
able
to
get
away
when
the
cart
was
finally
unloaded
at
the
town
refuse
ordinary
man
blenched
at
the
very
proposition
nevertheless
it
was
only
bad
generalship
which
prevented
them
at
least
from
getting
clear
of
the
camp
one
officer
successfully
negotiated
his
part
of
the
programme
and
was
well
hidden
away
in
the
cart
which
was
clearing
the
a
kaserne
bin
his
partner
however
was
noticed
by
the
sentry
and
the
alarm
was
given
with
the
result
that
after
much
prodding
and
mild
comedy
each
unfortunate
was
finally
unearthed
from
his
malodorous
retreat
and
the
pair
were
marched
off
to
the
cells
taking
the
bathroom
en
route
as
a
necessary
preliminary
the
star
of
niemeyer
was
in
the
ascendant
every
fruitless
attempt
increased
his
arrogance
and
intensified
his
style
of
buffoonery
the
devil
himself
when
the
alarm
was
on
he
could
afford
to
jest
and
be
merry
at
our
expense
as
soon
as
the
damage
had
been
put
right
and
the
tally
of
his
charges
agreed
once
again
with
the
official
register
he
would
say
strutting
up
to
a
group
of
us
as
we
were
discussing
the
strover
episode
have
taught
me
a
lesson
i
shall
not
forget
it
you
need
not
trouble
any
more
good
or
some
officer
of
field
rank
but
just
out
from
five
cells
for
his
last
attempt
would
be
lolling
listlessly
about
gazing
blankly
on
the
horizon
and
freedom
to
him
niemeyer
suddenly
appearing
would
proffer
unsought
advice
is
no
good
colonel
you
can
not
do
it
i
see
to
it
you
know
and
pass
on
before
the
other
had
time
to
reply
or
he
would
stroll
up
to
a
knot
of
officers
and
discuss
bootshops
in
bond
street
and
express
his
regret
that
he
should
in
all
probability
never
visit
london
again
he
had
been
very
fond
of
london
what
a
pity
it
all
was
but
then
he
was
only
a
poor
captain
and
had
to
carry
out
his
orders
if
only
the
british
would
give
their
not
to
escape
he
would
order
the
wire
to
be
removed
immediately
the
best
man
to
deal
with
him
in
these
moods
was
one
broncho
indeed
never
failed
to
tell
the
commandant
exactly
what
he
thought
of
him
and
was
a
privileged
person
to
that
extent
no
good
talking
like
that
commandant
he
would
say
a
disgrace
even
to
the
xth
army
corps
and
you
know
and
niemeyer
would
strut
away
hugely
pleased
but
these
moods
were
few
and
far
between
and
made
him
the
unreliable
blackguard
that
he
was
for
weeks
at
a
time
we
would
be
denied
the
privilege
of
seeing
his
bulky
figure
in
the
inevitable
blue
greatcoat
swaggering
along
hands
in
pockets
cigar
in
mouth
and
cap
well
on
the
back
of
his
head
during
these
periods
he
sat
tight
in
the
recesses
of
the
kommandantur
and
put
out
the
tentacles
of
his
power
through
his
various
minions
he
was
reputed
to
have
bouts
of
drink
and
drugging
and
to
hold
wild
orgies
in
his
comfortable
apartments
rumour
credited
him
with
having
been
seen
vomiting
on
to
the
courtyard
from
an
upper
window
supported
on
either
side
by
welman
and
ulrich
certain
it
is
that
his
eight
outbursts
above
related
were
confined
almost
entirely
to
these
periods
of
segregation
and
suggested
forcibly
the
morning
after
the
night

he
had
moreover
succeeded
in
ridding
himself
of

in

succeeded
wyndham
in

fought
him
at
the
rate
of
about
three

for

to
force
the
issue
on
the

question
and
accused
niemeyer
openly
of

the

almost
speechless

him
to
produce

characteristically
refused

and
bingham
went
the
next
day
it
happened
to
be
one
of
the
days
on
which
b
house
were
locked
into
their
barrack
in
expiation
of
some
microscopic
or
imaginary
offence
and
they
gave
vent
to
their
feelings
by
cheering
their
late
senior
officer
as
he
left
the
camp
loud
enough
and
long
enough
for
the
citizens
of
holzminden
to
suspect
either
that
niemeyer
had
been
assassinated
or
that
we
had
won
the
war
that
was
the
end
of
bingham
his
successor
was
of
a
less
militant
stamp
and
things
were
allowed
to
drift
on
in
their
existing
unsatisfactory
state
there
was
one
brighter
spot
von

was
induced
to
make
a
grudging
recantation
about

again

but
to
return
to
our

and
their

attention
had
from
the
start
of
the
tunnelling
scheme
been
directed
to
the
subterranean
parts
of
kaserne
kaserne
a
had
for
the
purposes
of
a
tunnel
been
ruled
out
for
various
reasons
for
one
thing
the
personnel
of
the
as
originally
constituted
belonged
almost
exclusively
to
kaserne
b
for
another
kaserne
b
was
in
itself
the
building
more
favourably
placed
geographically
for
such
an
attempt
kaserne
a
was
for
half
its
length
kommandantur
its
was
out
of
reach
for
the
english
accordingly
the
basement
corridor
of
kaserne
b
was
studied
in
all
its
aspects
it
will
be
remembered
that
this
floor
contained
the
detention
cells
and
the
various
cellars
that
it
was
entered
at
each
end
of
the
building
through
a
door
at
the
bottom
of
a
short
flight
of
steps
and
that
half
way
down
the
corridor
itself
were
two
doors
usually
locked
it
will
be
clear
perhaps
that
the
business
end
of
the
building
from
the
escape
point
of
view
was
bound
to
be
the
far
end
and
that
the
best
base
of
operations
would
be
somewhere
underground
in
the
vicinity
of
the
entrance
owing
to
the
near
presence
of
the
detention
cells
and
the
consequent
risk
of
meeting
the
gaoler
at
awkward
moments
it
would
be
useless
to
enter
the
corridor
at
the
end
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
underworld
by
going
in
the
first
instance
through
the
entrance
thence
some
part
of
the
basement
floor
might
be
penetrated
either
through
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
or
by
some
other
be
explained
shortly
the
door
i
have
mentioned
was
used
only
by
the
germans
and
was
kept
locked
it
might
be
possible
to
tamper
with
this
lock
but
it
would
have
to
be
done
from
the
outside
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
these
points
have
been
laboured
but
it
is
highly
essential
for
it
to
be
understood
at
the
start
that
the
only
possible
entry
to
the
potential
base
of
by
breaking
down
the
barricade
or
by
burrowing
at
some
point
through
the
reinforced
concrete
of
the
actual
masonry
of
the
building
a
process
which
would
greatly
imperil
discovery
in
the
first
instance
through
the
entrance
i
have
explained
that
there
was
a
short
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
the
basement
floor
this
was
on
the
right
as
you
passed
the
threshold
of
the
entrance
door
on
the
left
was
the
first
flight
of
the
staircase
leading
up
to
the
baggage
rooms
and
quarters
to
the
left
of
the
steps
down
and
completely
blocking
up
the
underneath
part
of
the
first
flight
up
was
a
palisade
of
stout
upright
planks
each
about
six
inches
across
a
further
boche

against
undue
communication
with

illustration
a
section
of
staircase
chamber
and
tunnel
just
as
a
dummy
key
to
open
the
basement
corridor
door
had
been
completed
somebody
had
a
which
enabled
the
whole
idea
of
using
the
cellar
passage
at
all
to
be
dispensed
with
it
was
conjectured
correctly
as
it
turned
out
that
behind
these
planks
there
must
be
some
sort
of
square
cellar
or
chamber
not
actually
in
use
by
the
germans
two
sides
of
it
would
be
bounded
directly
by
the
eastern
and
southern
walls
of
the
kaserne
the
western
side
by
the
last
cellar
in
the
basement
corridor
the
potato
cellar
and
the
northern
side
by
the
inside
wall
of
the
corridor
itself
if
this
supposition
was
correct
and
if
the
place
could
be
got
at
it
would
be
an
ideal
spot
both
as
a
base
of
operations
for
the
tunnel
and
a
receptacle
for
the
excavated
earth
it
was
decided
therefore
by
loosening
one
or
more
of
the
planks
and
hingeing
them
so
that
they
could
be
moved
as
required
in
and
out
of
position
to
arrange
a
makeshift
but
effective
for
the
daily
needs
of
the
the
ceremony
at
the
laying
of
the
foundation
should
say
perhaps
removing
the
foundation
not
largely
attended
for
one
thing
there
were
at
that
time
only
about
four
people
in
the
know
at
all
for
another
a
german
sentry
was
standing
on
guard
immediately
outside
the
door
two
officers
in
clothes
were
responsible
for
the
whole
operation
they
removed
whole
of
the
loosened
the
two
necessary
planks
and
replaced
it
the
structure
of
planks
fitted
very
closely
against
the
side
and
top
except
for
one
place
at
the
top
of
the
plank
nearest
to
the
corner
post
of
the
partition
next
to
the
cellar
floor
and
immediately
under
the
concrete
of
the
staircase
where
there
was
a
small
aperture
looking
like
a
misfit
of
the
boards
just
under
this
on
the
inside
of
course
of
the
bolt
was
fixed
a
small
hand
could
just
reach
the
bolt
comfortably
from
the
outside
and
slide
it
in
and
out
of
the
corner
post
had
the
aperture
been
ever
so
little
smaller
no
male
hand
could
have
got
in
at
all
and
in
the
absence
of
female
society
the
conspirators
would
have
had
either
to
give
up
this
entrance
altogether
or
increase
the
size
of
the
aperture
which
would
have
been
most
dangerous
by
using
this
door
as
a
means
of
entrance
to
and
exit
from
the
chamber
which
as
will
be
explained
later
proved
to
exist
behind
the
planks
the
original
party
of
conspirators
succeeded
in
beginning
a
tunnel
they
dug
through
the
southern
foundation
wall
of
the
building
turned
east
at
right
angles
and
succeeded
by
about
christmas
in
reaching
a
point
beyond
the
outer
wall
a
square
chamber
was
made
at
the
far
end
of
the
tunnel
then
about
yards
long
to
receive
the
earth
of
the
roof
on
the
occasion
of
the
escape
and
all
was
ready
for
a
move
when
niemeyer
suddenly
put
a
sentry
the
outer
wall
almost
on
top
of
the
proposed
site
of
exit
footnote
point
in
plan
on
p
just
at
this
time
the
exchange
of
to
holland
began
to
operate
to
some
of
the
original
conspirators
no
the
apparent
complete
frustration
of
all
their
plans
the
chance
of
going
to
holland
seemed
too
good
to
be
given
up
for
the
now
very
distant
hope
of
escape
and
so
it
came
about
that
the
of
the
tunnel
changed
hands
almost
completely
only
three
of
the
original
conspirators
remaining
in
the
firm
as
all
doors
were
locked
just
before
dusk
the
available
time
was
necessarily
limited
to
daylight
between
nine
in
the
morning
and
evening
about
an
hour
before
dark
the
actual
working
hours
were
considerably
shorter
in
the
first
place
the
coast
was
never
sufficiently
clear
in
the
morning
for
the
tunnel
to
be
approached
until
about
and
in
the
second
place
a
considerable
margin
had
to
be
allowed
when
coming
off
duty
for
any
possible
delay
in
getting
a
clear
exit
and
so
running
the
risk
of
being
discovered
absent
from
in
addition
to
this
the
time
spent
in
changing
clothes
had
to
be
taken
into
account
consequently
the
actual
working
hours
were
not
as
a
rule
from
noon
to
this
arrangement
however
acceptable
to
a
trades
union
official
was
not
good
for
tunnelling
as
will
be
understood
the
utmost
care
had
to
be
exercised
in
approaching
the
entrance
in
order
to
gain
access
to
the
tunnel
and
the
ordinary
daily
programme
was
carried
out
on
something
like
the
following
lines
we
will
assume
that
it
is
about
the
party
of
three
on
duty
for
the
day
assemble
in
a
little
room
on
the
ground
floor
and
near
the
entrance
they
then
take
off
their
uniforms
and
slip
on
the
black
trousers
with
yellow
stripes
the
black
coats
with
yellow
armlets
and
the
black
caps
with
yellow
bands
which
form
the
distinctive
dress
of
all
in
germany
probably
greatcoats
are
put
on
as
well
for
it
would
be
highly
inconvenient
if
a
german
came
in
just
at
this
moment
and
wanted
to
know
the
why
and
wherefore
of
this
change
of
attire
meanwhile
one
or
more
are
standing
outside
the
entrance
watching
for
the
signal
from
one
of
the
faithful
orderlies
standing
in
their
own
doorway
who
in
their
turn
are
waiting
for
some
germans
working
down
in
the
cellars
to
clear
out
for
their
meal
possibly
there
is
a
hitch
on
this
particular
morning
the
stolid
german
is
working
later
than
usual
in
the
cellars
at
that
end
of
the
building
possibly
the
german
may
knock
off
work
before
his
accustomed
time
and
the
signal
may
be
given
earlier
than
usual
but
quick
or
slow
the
signal
comes
in
due
of
the
orderlies
comes
out
and
scratches
his
head
the
sign
that
all
is
clear
at
his
end
the
officer
on
picket
duty
at
the
entrance
casts
one
quick
look
round
to
see
that
no
boches
are
approaching
from
the
direction
of
the
kommandantur
and
then
goes
to
the
room
in
which
the
party
are
waiting
and
tells
them
to
move
then
he
returns
to
his
post
to
continue
his
watch
until
the
party
are
safely
on
their
way
and
he
gets
a
further
signal
from
doorway
that
they
have
actually
entered
the
tunnel
the
three
in
the
little
room
shed
their
overcoats
don
their
caps
and
sally
forth
trying
to
look
as
much
like
the
british
tommy
off
duty
as
is
possible
under
the
circumstances
this
is
the
time
for
them
and
much
practising
has
made
them
reasonably
good
actors
in
the
part
often
however
an
additional
embarrassment
is
provided
in
the
shape
of
a
parcel
of
timber
for
strutting
the
roof
of
the
tunnel
or
a
bundle
of
tin
tubes
to
lengthen
the
air
pipe
arrived
at
the
door
they
enter
and
stand
just
inside
it
out
of
sight
of
the
sentry
whose
the
wire
just
him
a
good
view
of
the
door
as
he
stands
still
facing
the
camp
but
it
is
unusual
for
the
sentry
to
stand
there
long
and
as
soon
as
he
begins
to
march
away
the
orderly
who
is
standing
in
the
doorway
with
one
eye
on
his
every
movement
gives
the
word
and
the
party
slips
quickly
down
the
steps
leading
to
the
cellar
where
one
of
the
orderlies
slides
the
plank
and
lets
them
in
the
aperture
is
less
than
a
foot
wide
but
they
squeeze
in
somehow
the
door
is
shut
and
bolted
again
in
a
second
and
the
orderlies
after
making
sure
that
all
is
outside
the
partition
go
off
and
leave
the
party
to
their
work
where
we
shall
follow
them
in
a
little
while
such
was
the
game
of
bluff
which
took
place
daily
on
that
little
stretch
between
the
doors
of
kaserne
b
for
nine
long
months
had
any
of
the
party
been
ever
recognised
and
identified
the
game
would
have
been
up
any
ground
for
suspicion
on
the
part
of
the
germans
must
have
led
either
to
the
tunnel
being
discovered
or
at
least
the
door
being
kept
so
closely
under
surveillance
that
another
plan
of
getting
underground
would
have
had
to
be
devised
but
such
a
contretemps
did
not
occur
until
of
the
work
had
been
done
seven
and
a
half
months
from
the
beginning
of
it
and
even
then
the
mischief
was
not
fatal
to
the
success
of
the
scheme
luck
indeed
but
perhaps
not
quite
so
much
a
matter
of
mere
luck
as
might
appear
at
first
sight
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
irrefutable
law
of
mathematical
probabilities
there
were
two
platoons
of
landstürmers
detailed
for
the
guard
of
the
camp
and
these
relieved
each
other
every
hours
each
platoon
was
divided
into
three
relays
of
about
ten
men
each
who
did
two
hours
on
and
four
hours
off
the
allocation
of
varied
for
each
individual
sentry
every
time
he
went
on
duty
it
might
quite
likely
be
a
fortnight
before
the
same
man
occupied
the
same
station
opposite
the
door
add
to
this
the
fact
that
there
were
british
officers
and
over
orderlies
in
the
camp
that
the
personnel
of
both
the
and
the
prisoners
was
continually
changing
and
that
the
thoughts
of
any
sentry
at
this
period
were
more
likely
to
be
occupied
with
memories
of
meals
in
the
past
with
dreams
of
meals
in
the
future
with
the
rottenness
of
the
war
in
general
and
of
niemeyer
in
particular
than
with
the
comings
and
goings
and
physiognomies
of
any
british
and
the
conclusion
is
arrived
at
that
the
risk
of
detection
on
this
account
alone
was
when
all
was
said
and
done
comparatively
slight
yet
risk
there
undoubtedly
was
from
chance
recognition
if
not
by
a
sentry
by
one
of
the
motley
crowd
which
comprised
the
german
personnel
of
the
camp
we
have
seen
that
the
attendant
at
the
detention
cells
could
remember
faces
his
comings
and
goings
to
and
from
the
cellar
floor
were
extremely
irregular
and
difficult
to
anticipate
at
any
moment
he
might
bob
up
from
the
cells
and
plump
face
to
face
into
the
three
going
to
or
returning
from
their
shift
the
german
interpreters
were
another
difficulty
they
might
come
into
the
enclosure
from
the
kommandantur
at
any
time
and
not
infrequently
their
business
led
them
into
the
quarters
so
might
the
corporal
in
charge
of
the
baggage
room
if
such
a
thing
occurred
and
was
at
all
likely
to
synchronise
with
the
passage
from
door
to
door
of
kaserne
b
of
three
officers
dressed
for
no
apparent
reason
in
clothes
it
was
the
task
of
the
picket
on
duty
to
intercept
the
intruders
dally
with
them
pilot
them
on
any
pretext
into
securer
waters
until
time
had
been
given
to
pass
the
danger
signal
either
to
the
changing
room
or
to
the
orderly
waiting
innocently
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
sometimes
the
was
delayed
for
hours
on
this
account
and
a
shift
was
lost
to
the
cause
those
not
in
the
vast
majority
of
the
sometimes
to
wonder
why
it
was
that
at
certain
times
of
the
day
there
were
always
one
or
two
members
of
a
particular
set
loafing
aimlessly
by
the
entrance
of
b
kaserne
some
critical
people
were
even
heard
to
remark
that
they
were
wasting
their
time
generally
speaking
the
immunity
from
scares
was
wonderful
wonderful
too
was
the
fidelity
of
the
germans
officers
and
men
alike
to
their
sacred
it
was
indeed
only
on
the
most
exceptional
occasions
that
a
german
ever
came
within
the
enclosure
during
this
period
it
is
actually
on
record
that
no
german
officer
except
on
special
occasions
such
as
inspection
days
search
days
or
days
did
even
niemeyer
most
active
of
belligerents
in
the
early
hours
was
a
party
to
the
universal
torpor
about
three
in
the
afternoon
he
would
wake
up
and
sally
forth
for
a
little
potter
round
the
premises
sometimes
he
came
in
at
the
postern
gate
by
the
entrance
for
which
of
course
he
had
a
private
key
therein
lay
danger
always
the
fact
is
that
niemeyer
although
no
fool
had
left
the
possibility
of
a
tunnel
out
of
his
scheme
of
defence
or
rather
he
must
after
mature
consideration
have
discarded
any
such
undertaking
as
physically
impossible
he
had
been
round
and
round
the
camp
viewed
it
inside
and
outside
in
all
its
aspects
seen
every
means
of
entry
to
the
cellar
floor
blocked
boarded
up
or
else
permanently
watched
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
below
the
surface
at
any
rate
he
was
absolutely
secure
against
attack
he
did
not
realise
as
undoubtedly
he
should
have
as
he
said
a
man
of
the
world
and
priding
himself
on
his
intimate
knowledge
of
the
given
time
and
sufficient
freedom
from
observation
holes
could
be
made
without
battering
rams
and
tunnels
without
the
proper
tools
that
he
was
himself
too
unpopular
with
his
own
people
to
depend
upon
clockwork
execution
of
his
orders
and
that
most
of
his
own
cowed
staff
and
every
german
civilian
who
knew
much
about
holzminden
camp
were
only
too
quite
a
moderate
consideration
in
the
shape
of
soap
dripping
or
contribute
indirectly
to
doing
him
a
bad
turn
and
here
before
we
follow
our
conspirators
behind
the
planks
under
the
staircase
it
will
be
well
to
describe
these
various
agents
the
bureaux
to
which
they
repaired
with
their
information
the
caches
and
repositories
for
the
contraband
articles
which
they
brought
into
the
camp
and
some
of
the
hundred
and
one
devices
wherewith
dust
was
thrown
in
the
eyes
of
authority
there
was
a
youthful
prussian
known
as
the
letter
boy
and
so
called
because
his
principal
task
was
the
sorting
out
and
distribution
of
letters
he
had
a
little
broken
english
and
a
fair
amount
of
french
and
he
used
either
language
to
lament
publicly
the
fact
that
his
nationality
was
what
it
was
this
young
man
also
acted
as
the
confidential
clerk
of
niemeyer
and
was
often
used
by
him
instead
of
the
official
interpreters
to
take
messages
and
issue
orders
to
individual
officers
in
the
camp
hating
niemeyer
as
he
did
only
one
degree
less
than
prussia
and
being
ready
to
go
to
any
lengths
of
did
not
involve
return
for
favours
received
he
was
as
may
be
imagined
a
useful
informant
every
morning
he
would
repair
to
a
room
on
the
attic
floor
of
kaserne
a
which
was
inhabited
by
five
hardened
and
inveterate
escapers
and
which
was
regarded
as
the
distributing
centre
of
escape
materials
to
the
entire
camp
here
over
a
cup
of
coffee
and
some
biscuits
he
would
save
the
latest
news
from
the
kommandantur
was
going
to
be
a
search
he
had
seen
the
telegram
ordering
it
a
new
list
for
holland
had
come
in
from
hanover
ulrich
had
had
high
words
with
the
commandant
on
account
of
the
alleged
appropriation
by
niemeyer
of
his
christmas
wine
ration
for
the
last
week
a
fortnum
parcel
had
found
its
way
every
day
into
kitchen
so
on
and
he
usually
turned
out
to
be
right
he
was
a
useful
lad
he
was
asked
every
kind
of
leading
question
and
he
asked
none
back
if
he
was
commissioned
to
buy
anything
and
it
was
small
enough
to
go
into
his
pocket
he
bought
and
brought
it
regularly
and
punctually
he
must
have
guessed
enough
of
what
was
going
on
to
be
in
a
position
to
wreck
the
entire
scheme
if
he
had
wanted
to
but
he
remained
to
the
end
punctiliously
loyal
to
his
disloyalty
and
smiled
quite
complacently
at
the
fullness
of
the
final
success
then
there
was
the
boy
a
sturdy
young
frisian
who
for
some
occult
reason
had
contrived
to
confine
his
active
service
in
the
war
to
six
months
on
the
south
russian
front
theoretically
he
was
prussian
and
all
that
was
horrible
actually
he
was
friendly
and
useful
though
not
of
course
to
be
trusted
to
the
same
lengths
as
the
letter
boy
he
spoke
good
german
and
not
the
villainous
dialect
which
made
direct
negotiation
so
difficult
with
most
of
the
personnel
of
the
camp
he
was
good
for
any
number
of
pocket
electric
torches
and
an
occasional
bottle
of
another
was
the
sanitary
only
civilian
who
was
allowed
into
the
camp
without
a
sentry
to
watch
his
movements
this
gentleman
kept
a
wife
and
family
on
the
adjoining
premises
and
was
always
ready
in
return
for
services
rendered
to
enrich
his
scanty
larder
with
a
store
of
english
tins
he
was
difficult
of
access
as
his
duties
did
not
as
a
rule
take
him
into
the
buildings
and
he
was
in
a
terrible
funk
of
being
found
out
most
of
his
business
was
transacted
in
innocent
conversation
with
the
orderlies
over
the
state
of
the
refuse
bin
or
in
consultation
over
a
drain
ultimately
his
larder
was
found
too
convincingly
full
of
english
tinned
foods
and
he
disappeared
from
our
midst
but
he
had
contributed
his
quota
there
was
a
girl
typist
in
the
kommandantur
whom
no
one
ever
saw
but
who
conducted
a
passionate
love
intrigue
with
an
australian
flying
corps
officer
through
the
agency
of
letters
attached
to
a
weight
and
collected
by
an
accomplice
sentry
letters
outward
from
the
camp
were
dropped
in
this
way
from
the
window
picked
up
by
the
sentry
and
so
reached
their
destination
in
the
kommandantur
the
inward
mail
used
to
be
thrown
up
by
the
sentry
and
caught
at
the
window
whenever
news
of
general
interest
was
included
in
the
love
passages
an
excerpt
was
made
and
handed
to
the
senior
british
officer
as
the
girl
worked
in
the
office
there
was
often
valuable
material
in
these
missives
and
she
also
acted
as
a
check
on
the
information
supplied
by
the
letter
boy
as
to
the
satisfaction
got
out
of
the
purely
personal
side
of
the
affair
opinions
might
vary
an
interchange
of
photographs
was
considered
too
risky
and
it
is
believed
that
neither
party
to
the
adventure
ever
knew
what
the
other
really
looked
like
at
close
quarters
the
had
a
similar
affair
but
was
found
out
and
banished
to
a
camp
forfeiting
thereby
a
comfortable
monthly
income
from
cutting
hair
and
leaving
an
awkward
gap
both
in
the
tonsorial
staff
of
which
he
was
the
only
really
efficient
member
and
the
orchestra
in
which
he
had
for
many
months
been
the
recognised
authority
on
wind
instruments
an
obliging
canteen
attendant
a
patriotic
alsatian
amongst
the
parcel
room
staff
and
half
a
dozen
frankly
neutral
sentries
completed
the
list
of
what
might
be
called
from
our
point
of
view
the
german
effectives
the
do
them
beyond
suspicion
the
majority
of
them
would
have
been
infinitely
rather
on
the
western
front
than
in
their
present
uncongenial
position
we
never
attempted
to
meddle
with
them
and
indeed
there
was
no
need
the
interpreters
although
in
every
way
friendly
and
obliging
were
too
closely
occupied
with
the
multitudinous
tasks
of
their
daily
routine
to
invite
overtures
there
were
only
three
of
them
in
the
camp
and
what
with
acting
as
intermediaries
in
disputes
visiting
the
cells
distributing
letters
and
dancing
attendance
in
and
out
of
season
on
their
german
superiors

were
the
most
people
in

hardly
a
minute

call
their
own
adders

a
dusseldorfian
with
a
perpetual
smile
and
a
gait

was
regarded
generally
with
perhaps
unmerited
distrust

been
interned
early
in
the

would
say

my
heart
is
in

stands
very
little
chance
of
getting
back
there
he
must
pay

the
misdeeds
of
his

a
little
of
a

an
accent
acquired

side
of

used
to
come
to
the
theatrical
shows
and

enraptured
through
the
most
scurrilous
and
thinly
veiled
allusions
to
niemeyer
and
other
ornaments
of
the
xth
army
corps
the
fact
that
they
were
there
solely
as
censors
rather
added
zest
to
the
humour
of
it
sometimes
even
they
lost
dignity
wolff
in
particular
was
not
proof
against
the
attractions
of
the
chemical
compound
which
in
those
days
used
to
pass
for
rhine
wine
and
after
one
entertainment
at
which
the
bottle
passed
somewhat
freely
he
became
violently
intoxicated
and
was
found
next
morning
asleep
in
an
orchard
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
having
temporarily
thrown
off
the
bonds
of
barrack
discipline
and
made
a
regular
night
of
it
the
hardened
criminals
of

on
the
attic
floor

equally
satisfactorily
the
traces
of
their
contraband
consignments
and
the
tracks
of
the
consigners

the
outward
eye
there
was
not
a
more
room
in
the
whole
of
the
two
buildings
but
lurked
everywhere
the
floor
in
this
as
in
nearly
every
other
room
was
fortunately
straightforward
planking
laid
without
bolts
or
intersections
once
one
plank
had
been
loosened
and
removed
there
was
a
space
about
five
to
six
inches
deep
between
the
planking
and
the
foundation
of
the
floor
wherein
to
store
treasure
when
one
plank
had
been
removed
the
remainder
could
be
slid
up
and
down
at
leisure
and
the
whole
of
the
space
filled
up
if
necessary
this
practice
was
universal
and
before
the
end
there
was
hardly
a
room
without
its
cache
not
one
of
which
in
spite
of
two
or
three
most
conscientious
and
searches
was
ever
discovered
in
this
room
also
there
were
sliding
panels
in
the
walls
false
partitions
in
the
cupboards
false
bottoms
in
the
drawers
almost
everything
that
ought
to
have
been
solid
was
hollow
here
maps
were
photographed
without
cameras
and
developed
without
solutions
german
uniforms
were
made
for
use
if
a
suitable
opportunity
arose
an
air
pump
was
constructed
out
of
bits
of
wood
and
the
leather
of
an

were
made
out
of

a
device

out
to

it

the
little
room
on
the
ground
floor
in
b

where
the
working
shifts
changed
into
their
clothes
was
almost
as
complete
a
mask
the
clothes
themselves
were
kept
unlocked
at
the
bottom
of
several
british
uniforms
in
a
wooden
box
if
a
search
came
they
would
have
to
take
their
chance
of
being
found
it
was
impossible
to
them
afresh
under
the
boards
every
time
that
they
were
returned
from

the
owner
of
the
room
and
had
come
to
be
regarded
as
the
doyen
and
authority
amongst
escapers
in
the
camp
tim
had
had
a
curious
war
he
had
carried
despatches
for
a
fortnight
in
august
and
early
september
of
and
had
then
been
taken
prisoner
at
a
by
an
scholar
of
new
college
since
then
he
had
spent
his
time
either
preparing
to
escape
or
being
confined
for
doing
so
he
had
probably
been
out
of
more
camps
done
more
solitary
confinement
and
had
on
the
whole
harder
luck
than
any
other
in
germany
he
spoke
correct
german
with
a
strong
irish
accent
the
very
perfection
and
thoroughness
of
his
schemes
seemed
somehow
to
have
militated
against
their
success
in
all
his
time
in
germany
he
had
not
been
actually
at
large
for
more
than
half
an
hour
he
had
always
been
disguised
and
by
the
purest
the
gate
or
just
outside
it
he
had
gone
with
the
first
exchange
party
for
holland
but
at
aachen
he
had
announced
his
intention
of
coming
back
to
germany
and
had
brought
back
a
full
report
of
the
proceedings
at
aachen
and
the
lie
of
the
land
the
benefit
of
future
parties
it
was
generally
understood
that
an
attempt
to
escape
while
on
the
journey
to
holland
was
permissible
when
in
or
on
the
german
side
of
aachen
but
not
when
once
the
party
had
left
aachen
for
the
frontier
this
was
tim
all
over
when
he
was
not
working
for
his
own
hand
he
was
helping
others
he
disdained
such
vulgar
expedients
as
tunnels
and
was
now
hard
at
work
on
his
most
elaborate
scheme
of
all
he
intended
to
walk
out
of
the
main
gate
through
the
kommandantur
in
a
german
uniform
accompanied
by
a
young
and
dimpled
flying
officer
disguised
as
his
sweetheart
the
plot
was
by
now
almost
mature
and
the
curls
were
already
growing
in
a
most
beautiful
and
highly
suspicious
cluster
low
on
the
nape
of
the
young
neck
room
also
harboured
such
of
the
official
documents
of
the
senior
british
officer
and
his
adjutant
as
it
was
unwise
to
have
lying
about
in
the
event
of
a
search
one
of
these
was
a
most
damning
authoritative
and
complete
narrative
of
the
misdeeds
of
niemeyer
during
the
first
three
months
of
the
existence
it
was
called
the
black
book
and
was
biding
its
time
to
be
thrust
as
evidence
into
the
hands
of
some
superior
inspecting
official
from
the
unfortunately
that
opportunity
never
arrived
and
the
book
did
not
attain
publicity
till
it
was
produced
in
copenhagen
after
the
armistice
it
then
made
interesting
reading
chapter
vi
in
the
tunnel
we
left
the
trio
next
for
duty
in
process
of
disappearing
behind
the
planks
and
about
to
start
on
their
shift
at
the
face
of
the
tunnel
let
us
keep
company
with
them
awhile
at
their
difficult
and
absorbing
task
tunnelling
had
at
least
one
great
advantage
over
other
methods
of
escape
that
the
interest
attaching
to
the
actual
preparation
was
able
to
to
some
extent
the
suspense
and
anxiety
as
to
ultimate
success
there
was
no
opportunity
to
mope
the
immediate
business
was
to
defeat
not
only
the
boche
but
nature
too
with
all
the
odds
on
the
side
the
bolting
of
the
wooden
partition
behind
the
last
of
the
trio
shuts
out
the
day
and
adds
the
proper
molish
touch
to
the
scene
however
what
at
first
appears
pitch
dark
becomes
gradually
less
so
and
presently
the
party
can
see
enough
to
change
their
more
or
less
clean
clothes
for
the
filthy
sodden
rags
which
they
wear
for
work
in
the
tunnel
there
are
other
minor
discomforts
besides
the
darkness
and
the
damp
there
is
an
indescribable
musty
smell
produced
by
a
mélange
of
damp
clay
and
earth
mice
old
clothes
and
air
a
smell
which
you
have
to
go
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
to
get
the
working
clothes
are
soon
on
the
clean
clothes
stowed
carefully
away
and
a
move
is
made
to
the
tunnel
mouth
look
at
the
plan
on
and
glean
a
rough
idea
of
the
shape
of
the
chamber
and
the
siting
of
the
tunnel
mouth
the
ground
area
is
roughly
four
yards
by
five
the
height
varies
for
on
the
near
kommandantur
side
the
roof
consists
of
the
concrete
foundation
to
the
first
flight
of
the
staircase
while
on
the
far
next
to
the
eastern
wall
of
the
the
cellar
steps
the
ground
level
which
is
also
the
roof
level
at
the
southern
end
is
about
five
feet
above
the
chamber
floor
into
the
available
recesses
formed
by
this
irregular
enclosure
all
the
tunnel
earth
must
be
stowed
away
the
hollow
under
the
cellar
steps
is
already
full
and
so
will
be
the
opposite
hollow
under
the
staircase
before
the
end
is
reached
for
a
passage
through
the
earth
must
be
displaced
somewhere
and
it
will
be
a
near
thing
and
will
require
the
most
careful
and
economical
storage
if
the
displacements
can
be
kept
within
the
narrow
cubic
space
which
is
all
that
can
be
earmarked
for
them
a
passage
from
the
partition
door
to
the
tunnel
mouth
must
be
preserved
at
all
costs
the
tunnel
mouth
has
been
hacked
through
the
main
southern
wall
of
the
building
just
where
it
joins
the
cellar
floor
it
issues
about
three
feet
below
the
ground
underneath
the
then
bears
sharp
left
in
the
direction
of
the
outer
wall
now
the
outer
wall
is
but
ten
yards
away
at
this
point
and
had
the
original
scheme
of
the
tunnel
gone
as
it
had
been
planned
all
would
have
been
over
long
before
this
particular
may
day
and
the
conspirators
would
have
made
their
bid
for
freedom
there
was
nothing
very
herculean
involved
in
getting
the
tunnel
to
the
other
side
of
the
wall
and
popping
up
on
a
dark
night
with
the
friendly
wall
acting
as
a
screen
from
the
view
of
the
nearest
sentry
but
unfortunately
as
has
been
explained
niemeyer
had
taken
precautionary
measures
just
before
the
party
were
ready
to
move
and
had
put
a
sentry
at
the
outside
corner
of
the
building
effectually
covering
the
spot
unless
this
sentry
was
removed
it
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
have
a
reasonable
prospect
of
success
to
continue
the
tunnel
until
a
point
was
reached
where
it
would
be
possible
to
emerge
under
cover
these
bald
words
can
not
attempt
to
convey
the
bitter
disappointment
caused
by
manœuvre
or
the
seriousness
of
the
altered
prospect
but
the
tunnellers
of
holzminden
set
their
teeth
and
prepared
themselves
if
necessary
to
go
on
digging
for
a
year
rather
than
run
the
risk
that
any
of
the
party
should
be
spotted
by
a
sentry
as
he
emerged
it
was
known
how
many
a
previous
tunnel
scheme
had
been
shattered
miserably
on
this
rock
simply
through
lack
of
the
necessary
patience
to
go
on
with
the
job
at
schwarmstedt
not
so
many
months
before
this
had
happened
the
tunnel
came
out
quite
close
to
the
wire
one
officer
got
out
and
got
away
but
in
so
doing
was
observed
by
a
sentry
his
successor
had
no
sooner
put
his
head
above
ground
than
he
was
shot
dead
in
the
most
and
treacherous
murdered
if
one
may
venture
on
the
paradox
there
was
a
road
immediately
beyond
the
outside
wall
and
the
ground
beyond
the
road
was
planted
with
crops
and
vegetables
over
a
belt
of
about
yards
in
breadth
the
whole
of
this
belt
was
searched
by
the
glare
from
the
strong
electric
lamps
at
the
corner
of
the
wall
day
and
night
there
was
now
a
sentry
outside
the
wall
if
niemeyer
had
posted
machine
guns
at
intervals
of
yards
round
the
camp
he
could
hardly
have
felt
more
immune
from
attack
more
absolutely
secure
from
any
attempt
to
spring
him
by
the
tunnel
method
it
was
early
offer
any
decided
opinion
as
to
what
the
vegetables
were
likely
to
be
if
they
turned
out
to
be
crops
which
were
not
high
enough
to
offer
adequate
cover
to
the
escapers
there
would
be
no
the
sketch
will
to
tunnel
grimly
on
till
the
was
reached
several
yards
further
away
but
the
rye
would
be
cut
in
early
august
at
latest
and
meanwhile
the
tunnel
had
advanced
barely
ten
yards
beyond
the
outside
wall
and
at
best
a
progress
crowned
during
this
period
the
effort
of
each
laborious
day
this
meant
about
yards
still
to
tunnel
and
three
months
to
go
in
a
losing
race
probably
unless
progress
could
be
accelerated
and
this
as
the
work
took
the
party
further
and
further
from
their
base
was
hardly
to
be
expected
illustration
scale
roughly
yds
inch
course
of
the
tunnel
see
also
frontispiece
so
it
is
with
the
depressed
feeling
of
having
to
work
against
time
as
well
as
nature
that
our
friends
assemble
behind
the
partition
on
this
particular
morning
they
are
standing
or
rather
stooping
at
the
entrance
and
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
light
up
fortunately
someone
has
remembered
to
bring
the
matches
so
number
lights
a
couple
of
precious
candles
we
were
dependent
entirely
on
england
for
these
commodities
and
crawls
in
he
sticks
one
candle
in
the
pump
chamber
which
is
just
round
the
first
corner
and
about
six
feet
from
the
entrance
and
proceeds
on
his
way
with
the
other
his
progress
is
necessarily
slow
very
slow
as
the
tunnel
is
so
small
that
he
is
compelled
to
along
on
his
elbows
and
toes
there
is
no
help
for
this
the
hole
must
be
as
small
as
possible
because
of
the
extreme
economy
to
be
exercised
in
the
disposition
of
the
displaced
earth
number
enters
the
pump
chamber
and
starts
working
the
pump
this
instrument
consists
of
a
vertical
bellows
manufactured
from
wood
and
from
the
leather
of
a
flying
coat
and
is
operated
by
number
with
his
left
hand
as
he
sits
facing
it
and
looking
along
the
tunnel
towards
the
face
the
pump
is
screwed
to
wooden
uprights
which
are
securely
embedded
top
and
bottom
in
the
clay
soil
and
the
air
is
forced
into
a
pipe
composed
of
tin
tubes
made
out
of
biscuit
boxes
little
did
the
glorious
company
of
biscuit
makers
suspect
that
in
sending
us
our
means
of
sustenance
they
were
also
contributing
to
an
important
escape
this
pipe
is
sunk
in
the
floor
of
the
tunnel
and
is
kept
always
close
to
the
face
by
the
addition
of
more
and
yet
more
tubes
number
whose
duty
it
will
be
to
pack
the
earth
when
it
is
hauled
out
stays
outside
the
tunnel
mouth
and
sees
that
the
rope
attached
to
the
basin
is
running
clear
and
then
hands
the
basin
to
number
who
puts
it
in
front
of
him
ready
to
be
pulled
to
the
face
by
number
with
that
half
of
the
rope
which
extends
from
the
pump
chamber
to
the
face
we
shall
see
what
the
basin
was
for
if
we
accompany
number
on
his
journey
to
the
tunnel
face
for
the
first
few
yards
he
goes
down
a
slight
slope
then
again
for
a
few
yards
up
an
incline
to
the
place
where
it
was
originally
intended
to
make
the
beyond
the
boundary
wall
here
he
can
hear
the
of
the
footsteps
above
his
head
then
he
goes
down
again
pretty
steeply
for
three
or
four
yards
and
flattens
out
the
tunnel
swinging
slightly
first
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
all
this
time
he
has
been
going
through
fairly
soft
sort
of
sandy
yellow
clay
which
has
been
easy
enough
to
now
he
comes
to
the
stony
part
working
in
this
stretch
has
been
terribly
difficult
a
dense
seemingly
interminable
stratum
of
large
stones
has
been
encountered
the
stones
are
smooth
and
flat
tightly
pressed
together
in
a
horizontal
position
and
cemented
with
the
stickiest
of
clay
number
progress
becomes
positively
painful
he
barks
his
shoulders
on
the
stones
which
project
from
the
walls
his
toes
and
elbows
suffer
from
the
stones
beneath
him
occasionally
he
bumps
his
head
on
the
uneven
roof
and
all
the
time
he
must
keep
the
candle
alight
and
swear
only
in
an
undertone
soon
he
begins
to
ascend
this
comes
to
the
face
but
not
before
he
has
had
yet
one
more
unpleasant
experience
out
of
the
gloom
in
front
of
him
appears
suddenly
a
pair
of
wicked
little
eyes
horribly
bright
and
menacing
he
clenches
his
teeth
and
digs
his
chin
into
the
soil
beneath
him
the
large
rat
whose
solitude
he
has
disturbed
crawls
over
him
and
leaves
him
sweating
with
fright
and
almost
faint
with
the
eerie
sensation
of
it
but
the
tunnel
must
go
on
so
number
sticks
the
candle
on
some
convenient
stone
at
his
side
takes
the
cold
chisel
and
gets
to
work
in
five
minutes
or
less
he
has
loosened
a
bathful
of
stones
and
he
drops
the
chisel
takes
hold
of
his
end
of
the
rope
and
hauls
the
difficulties
of
hauling
on
a
rope
while
lying
in
a
tube
about
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
lined
with
knobbly
stones
can
be
imagined
but
can
not
be
adequately
described
soon
he
hears
the
rattling
of
the
basin
on
the
stones
behind
him
and
it
arrives
at
his
feet
next
comes
the
trick
of
getting
it
past
his
body
in
the
confined
space
then
the
filling
and
finally
the
almost
superhuman
juggling
feat
of
getting
the
full
basin
back
past
his
body
again
a
couple
of
jerks
at
the
rope
leading
to
the
pump
chamber
and
he
feels
it
tauten
the
basin
begins
to
move
away
and
number
turns
on
to
his
side
again
and
gets
to
work
taking
care
that
he
has
the
of
the
rope
attached
to
some
part
of
his
person
but
that
the
rest
of
it
is
free
if
he
is
a
fairly
quick
worker
he
will
have
another
load
of
stones
ready
by
the
time
the
basin
has
been
pulled
back
and
emptied
he
will
then
haul
it
up
again
and
repeat
the
whole
exhausting
process
no
wonder
that
the
tunnel
party
did
not
as
a
band
shine
as
games
enthusiasts
amongst
their
they
had
their
bellyful
of
exercise
down
below
sometimes
the
monotony
of
the
proceedings
is
varied
by
a
torrent
of
subdued
cursing
from
the
pump
chamber
while
the
full
basin
is
on
its
way
back
to
the
experienced
this
only
signifies
that
the
rope
has
broken
as
it
frequently
does
on
account
of
the
damp
and
the
incessant
friction
against
the
sides
roof
and
floor
of
the
tunnel
a
breakage
entails
a
journey
on
the
part
of
number
to
effect
repairs
while
number
pumps
the
working
time
is
divided
into
three
equal
parts
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
part
number
who
is
as
well
as
packer
informs
number
a
low
hail
informs
number
that
his
digging
is
over
for
the
day
and
he
retraces
his
more
accurately
wriggles
back
feet
foremost
for
there
is
no
room
to
turn
round
he
then
becomes
number
number
becomes
number
and
goes
to
the
face
whilst
number
becomes
number
and
pumps
so
the
work
goes
on
till
then
it
ceases
all
three
come
out
of
the
tunnel
and
change
back
into
their
clothes
to
await
the
signal
to
come
out
at
the
entrance
to
the
building
stand
two
of
the
orderlies
waiting
for
a
favourable
opportunity
to
let
them
out
and
just
as
during
the
morning
manœuvre
there
are
two
or
three
officers
loafing
about
for
no
apparent
reason
at
the
other
end
of
the
building
on
some
days
there
are
no
boche
about
at
this
time
and
immediate
exit
is
possible
but
they
happen
to
be
carrying
potatoes
down
to
the
adjoining
cellar
and
pass
to
and
fro
close
to
the
quite
plainly
visible
through
the
cracks
in
the
boards
they
could
not
see
anything
naturally
even
if
they
thought
of
looking
as
they
are
in
the
light
and
the
chamber
is
practically
in
the
dark
at
last
they
go
out
now
sings
out
one
of
the
orderlies
looking
skywards
and
as
if
singing
a
snatch
of
a
song
from
sheer
the
trio
unbolt
the
plank
door
and
slipping
quickly
to
the
top
of
the
steps
stand
just
inside
the
door
precisely
as
they
had
stood
in
the
morning
with
the
work
in
front
of
them
and
an
orderly
waiting
for
a
moment
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
fastens
the
secret
door
the
orderly
standing
at
the
entrance
looks
down
the
enclosure
to
make
sure
that
no
germans
are
about
and
then
says
off
they
go
again
if
the
sun
is
shining
the
light
is
very
dazzling
after
the
darkness
at
the
last
moment
perhaps
and
when
home
is
so
nearly
reached
a
german
feldwebel
appears
from
nowhere
in
particular
and
heads
for
the
same
door
out
from
the
cookhouse
which
stands
just
opposite
the
door
walks
one
of
the
aimless
lounging
loafing
officers
above
mentioned
and
delays
the
feldwebel
with
some
question
no
matter
how
trivial
so
home
is
safely
made
again
and
the
party
become
officers
once
more
and
put
off
their
clothes
then
follows
and
the
joy
of
a
good
wash
in
hot
water
and
something
to
eat
the
hours
have
not
been
long
but
the
foul
atmosphere
has
caused
considerable
fatigue
perhaps
a
bad
headache
and
in
case
anyone
should
still
think
after
reading
this
that
the
work
was
light
he
should
be
invited
to
wriggle
yards
on
elbows
and
toes
the
and
if
he
is
unduly
sceptical
in
public
he
will
lose
dignity
but
he
will
gain
an
appreciation
of
the
difficulties
of
the
performance
in
a
very
confined
space
there
are
a
few
other
points
in
regard
to
the
construction
of
the
tunnel
which
may
not
be
without
interest
when
and
where
necessary
the
roof
was
revetted
the
revetting
was
done
with
bed
boards
the
foundations
of
all
beds
in
the
camp
were
boards
placed
across
an
iron
frame
and
supporting
a
mattress
made
of
paper
straw
and
shavings
and
uneven
as
the
somme
battlefield
many
of
these
boards
had
been
commandeered
as
firewood
during
the
early
stages
of
the
camp
when
there
had
been
as
related
a
regrettable
hitch
in
the
arrangements
for
our
warming
many
more
now
found
their
way
underground
by
driblets
into
the
quarters
and
thence
into
the
recess
behind
the
planks
or
were
carried
direct
by
the
people
clamoured
querulously
for
the
missing
boards
which
they
had
saved
from
the
burning
and
of
which
they
had
now
been
robbed
no
one
except
the
very
few
in
the
secret
and
an
orderly
or
so
had
the
ghost
of
a
notion
what
had
really
happened
to
them
the
boche
when
appealed
to
of
course
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
quoted
the
equivalent
german
proverb
about
eating
your
cake
what
would
you
very
nearly
all
is
fair
in
escapes
the
only
tools
used
in
the
digging
of
the
tunnel
were
a
trowel
or
an
instrument
with
a
spike
at
one
end
and
an
excavating
blade
at
the
other
and
the
cold
chisel
the
chisel
was
useful
for
levering
apart
the
smooth
heavy
stones
which
presented
so
much
difficulty
it
seems
probable
that
these
stones
had
once
formed
the
bed
of
some
river
and
had
been
worn
smooth
and
packed
by
the
action
of
the
water
attempts
were
made
to
dodge
this
difficult
stratum
of
stones
which
retarded
progress
so
seriously
but
in
the
absence
of
proper
instruments
it
was
impossible
to
gauge
the
level
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
a
descent
of
four
feet
bringing
no
better
results
it
was
decided
to
come
back
to
the
previous
level
of
about
eight
or
nine
feet
below
the
surface
the
chamber
was
only
for
the
earth
when
the
last
sackful
had
been
piled
the
chamber
was
practically
full
of
earth
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
in

was
not
an
easy
matter
it
was
necessary

only
to

in
a
general
easterly
direction
as
straight
as
possible
there
were
rough
compasses
galore
in
the
camp

it
was
very
difficult
to
dig
the
tunnel
straight
and
the
compasses
were
too
small
to
check
errors
accurately

the
end
the
tunnel
had
become
too
twisted
and
hilly
to
permit
any
longer
of
the
rope

method
being
used
and
it
was
necessary
to
fill
sacks
and
drag
them
back
from
the
face
this
method
was
even
more
wearisome
and
exasperating
than
the
other
to
wriggle
back
by
oneself
was
bad
enough
to
wriggle
back
and
every
yard
or
so
pull
a
heavy
sack
after
one
was
infinitely
more
so
nevertheless
all
this
practice
had
its
advantages
it
braced
the
muscles

for

night

without

for
by

the
thing
was
beginning
to
be
known
and
discreetly
talked
about
and
shares
were
at
a
premium
a

might
have
been

whose

and
some
others

being
asked
their
intentions
politely
intimated
that
they
preferred
to
remain
in
germany
had
niemeyer
only
taken
more
intelligent
stock
of
the
particular
quarter
from
which
so
many
unexpected
refusals
emanated
it
is
possible
that
he
might
have
drawn
valuable
conclusions
but
niemeyer
astute
german
though
he
was
disregarded
these
and
other
even
more
valuable
hints
which
were
to
be
offered
him
before
the
scheme
was
ripe
for
launching
and
which
could
have
told
him
easily
enough
in
which
quarter
the
wind
blew
as
an
instance
of
one
there
arose
in
early
june
a
sudden
and
curious
demand
on
the
part
of
certain
individuals
for
transfer
from
a
to
b
kaserne
three
officers
comfortably
situated
in
a
small
room
in
the
former
house
the
same
room
by
the
way
as
that
in
which
the
letter
boy
used
to
spend
so
much
of
his
time
overlooking
the
picturesque
suburbs
of
holzminden
and
blessed
with
apparently
every
comfort
that
a
could
require
asked
unashamedly
if
they
might
become
one
of
a
motley
closely
packed
crew
in
one
of
the
big
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
of
b
kaserne
many
of
the
reasons
given
for
the
desire
to
change
were
ingenious
but
if
submitted
to
anybody
with
a
less
mould
of
thought
than
the
german
camp
officers
it
is
unlikely
that
they
would
have
convinced
however
change
they
were
allowed
to
and
change
they
did
and
the
of
twelve
were
now
all
lodged
in
b
kaserne
this
was
a
very
necessary
move
for
the
following
reason
tunnel
was
used
in
earnest
it
would
be
used
after
dark
and
consequently
those
who
intended
to
use
it
would
have
all
to
be
in
b
kaserne
at
the
time
for
any
less
important
occasion
it
might
have
been
feasible
for
the
a
house
members
of
the
scheme
to
arrange
to
change
places
for
the
night
with
accomplices
in
b
house
the
a
house
officers
answering
to
the
b
house
names
and
this
used
to
be
done
sometimes
for
occasions
such
as
a
birthday
party
or
a
theatrical
show
when
the
presence
of
some
member
of
the
other
house
was
essential
to
the
success
of
the
programme
but
more
often
than
not
it
was
spotted
and
either
condoned
or
reported
according
to
the
nature
and
temper
of
the
feldwebel
taking
the
on
a
large
scale
and
for
an
event
of
the
nature
of
the
tunnel
for
the
success
of
which
complete
absence
of
any
suspicion
on
the
part
of
the
germans
was
an
absolute
qua
such
a
risk
was
not
possible
and
indeed
could
not
be
allowed
it
was
intended
that
whatever
happened
and
whatever
the
hardship
that
might
occur
in
individual
cases
the
night
of
the
escape
should
not
find
a
single
officer
in
b
kaserne
who
was
not
domiciled
there
with
the
permission
of
the
germans
this
intention
was
happily
carried
into
effect
meanwhile
the
owners
of
the
shares
knowing
as
they
did
pretty
well
the
conditions
under
which
the
scheme
was
to
be
submitted
to
the
public
took
time
by
the
forelock
and
changed
houses
before
the
rush
it
was
indeed
an
undertaking
in
which
the
home
policy
was
fraught
with
almost
as
many
dangers
as
the
foreign
and
required
the
most
patient
and
tactful
handling
fortunately
there
was
only
one
of
the
allied
nations
in
the
camp
and
this
fact
of
itself
quartered
the
risk
jealousy
or
merely
latin
or
slavonic
exuberance
had
many
a
time
ere
this
during
the
war
wrecked
a
promising
and
plan
but
even
in
a
camp
where
all
were
english
and
the
loyalty
to
the
cause
of
the
whole
community
never
for
an
instant
came
in
question
there
were
yet
grave
risks
of
discovery
through
some
intemperate
speech
or
action
of
the
newly
captured
or
the
not
overwise
it
was
just
after
the
arrival
of
one
hundred
newly
captured
officers
from
the
big
march
offensive
of
that
the
cat
was
most
nearly
let
out
of
the
bag
a
was
on
and
the
audience
were
sitting
in
packed
rows
and
eager
expectancy
in
front
of
the
curtain
waiting
for
the
intellectual
fare
of
the
evening
to
be
set
forth
on
the
dining
room
tables
a
canteen
was
in
full
force
at
the
time
and
the
company
in
the
absence
of
the
bottle
that
cheers
was
comparatively
quiet
the
germans
used
to
make
so
much
money
out
of
the
english
over
the
wretched
wine
at
the
senior
british
officer
had
every
now
and
again
to
clap
on
a
drastic
boycott
on
the
canteen
and
forbid
officers
to
buy
anything
there
at
all
sometimes
this
policy
was
and
as
much
in
the
interests
of
peace
and
quiet
in
the
camp
as
to
the
detriment
of
german
profiteers
at
all
events
you
could
always
tell
whether
a
boycott
was
on
or
not
by
the
amount
of
noise
which
attended
the
fortnightly
shows
and
it
so
happened
that
on
the
particular
occasion
with
which
we
are
concerned
you
hear
your
neighbour
speak
suddenly
a
of
the
new
over
to
make
a
remark
to
an
officer
sitting
near
him
and
in
tone
uttered
the
dreadful
question
you
in
the
tunnel
a
shiver
ran
through
the
whole
of
the
adjoining
rows
two
of
the
german
interpreters
were
seated
within
two
yards
on
another
occasion
an
ingenuous
youth
was
found
leaning
out
of
one
of
the
first
floor
corridor
windows
and
carrying
on
an
animated
conversation
about
escapes
past
and
future
with
one
of
the
occupants
of
the
cells
they
were
apparently
analysing
the
causes
of
failure
of
a
recent
attempt
and
discussing
the
prospects
of
success
of
another
imminent
one
any
german
who
happened
to
be
in
the
building
at
the
was
midsummer
and
all
the
windows
were
not
fail
to
have
been
suitably
impressed
with
this
dialogue
a
newly
captured
officer
with
a
bump
of
observation
startled
those
near
him
one
day
by
singing
out
to
a
friend
to
know
whether
he
too
had
recognised
officers
walking
about
in
the
senior
british
officer
did
of
course
from
time
to
time
issue
stringent
orders
about
the
paramount
importance
of
secrecy
and
sometimes
personally
harangued
the
occupants
of
each
building
but
the
difficulty
was
to
cater
for
the
odd
we
used
to
call
elusive
half
per
either
succeeded
in
absenting
themselves
from
such
harangues
or
if
present
failed
to
understand
their
purport
and
of
whom
it
might
fairly
be
said
that
they
were
so
stupid
and
perverse
as
to
be
a
real
danger
to
their
own
side
on
whichever
side
of
the
line
a
bump
of
carelessness
a
bump
of
cussedness
a
faulty
sense
of
discipline
and
a
penchant
towards
selfish
two
or
three
endowed
with
these
qualities
were
gathered
together
the
lot
of
those
responsible
for
their
actions
was
not
a
pleasant
one
the
senior
officer
was
powerless
if
any
chose
disloyally
or
unintentionally
not
to
support
him
he
exercised
the
authority
vested
in
his
person
by
virtue
of
regulations
and
there
it
ended
a
court
of
enquiry
and
a
threat
of
action
against
the
offender
was
the
limit
of
his
power
nor
was
it
easy
to
enjoin
general
secrecy
on
a
subject
which
was
never
put
publicly
into
words
hole
not
tunnel
was
the
word
used
if
a
word
had
to
be
then
only
in
an
undertone
or
behind
closed
doors
but
in
spite
of
these
potential
sources
of
leakage
nothing
occurred
to
mar
the
progress
of
the
tunnel
until
the
middle
of
may
when
it
had
been
in
full
swing
for
five
and
a
half
months
and
reached
to
somewhere
about
the
middle
of
the
vegetables
then
a
fell
it
was
announced
one
day
on
that
in
consequence
of
measures
of
reprisals
which
had
been
taken
against
german
officers
in
a
certain
camp
in
england
would
be
put
into
force
in
the
xth
army
corps
until
further
notice
there
would
be
no
less
than
four
a
day
at
and
music
theatricals
games
and
walks
were
to
be
stopped
and
no
newspapers
were
to
be
permitted
into
the
camp
the
commandant
regretted
but
orders
were
orders
and
so
on
in
the
usual
vein
it
struck
us
as
deliciously
ironical
that
on
ourselves
should
be
the
first
outward
and
visible
sign
that
anything
had
come
of
the
agitation
which
had
we
knew
been
raised
on
our
behalf
by
influential
officers
amongst
the
earlier
holland
parties
it
ultimately
transpired
that
strong
representations
had
been
made
to
the
german
war
office
as
to
the
maladministration
in
the
xth
army
corps
and
particularly
in
the
camps
governed
by
the
twin
brethren
heinrich
and
karl
niemeyer
when
it
became
clear
that
no
attention
was
being
paid
to
these
representations
steps
were
taken
to
collect
in
one
camp
in
england
all
the
german
officers
who
belonged
to
hanoverian
regiments
and
to
deal
with
them
as
a
measure
of
reprisals
on
appropriate
lines
the
measure
signally
failed
after
the
manner
of
reprisals
in
the
first
place
it
was
impossible
to
find
any
englishman
at
all
like
the
niemeyers
and
therefore
the
conditions
ruling
with
us
could
not
be
even
approximately
reproduced
at
home
in
the
second
place
a
german
government
that
was
as
yet
impenitent
and
still
sanguine
of
ultimate
success
decided
that
their
best
course
lay
in
prompt
one
of
the
features
of
this
was
that
we
were
invited
to
send
full
accounts
of
it
home
in
our
letters
provided
only
that
we
also
mentioned
the
alleged
reason
an
extra
letter
was
offered
us
in
which
to
do
so
this
was
a
clumsy
and
typical
german
device
to
endeavour
to
alienate
popular
feeling
at
home
needless
to
say
it
was
seen
through
and
not
a
single
letter
mentioned
the
subject
at
all
footnote
normally
we
were
allowed
to
write
two
letters
in
each
month
six
sides
to
a
letter
and
four
any
alternative
to
reprisals
as
a
means
for
one
belligerent
power
to
stop
the
malpractices
of
another
was
not
so
far
as
i
am
aware
discovered
during
the
war
but
it
was
a
poor
arrangement
at
the
best
the
added
had
a
serious
effect
upon
the
output
of
excavated
earth
for
the
working
hours
were
now
considerably
reduced
and
there
were
long
faces
amongst
the
initiate
those
in
authority
began
to
have
serious
qualms
as
to
if
all
went
well
from
now

have
advanced
near
enough
to

rye
crop
before
it
was
ripe

such
local
papers
as
we
were
now
compelled
to
smuggle
into
the
camp
spoke
of
an
early
harvest
added
to
this
the
entire
camp
having
now
no
games
to
play
and
nothing
particular
to
occupy
itself
with
began
to
take
notice
of
things
to
which
they
had
been
blind
hitherto
and
an
embarrassing
number
of
secretly
and
impressively
conducted
but
embarrassing
to
be
made
as
to
the
progress
of
the
unmentionable
thing
certain
people
all
at
once
discovered
that
they
could
in
future
only
support
existence
if
buoyed
up
by
the
hope
of
escape
and
began
to
ingratiate
themselves
accordingly
in
the
proper
quarter
there
arose
a
strong
and
inconvenient
demand
for
places
in
what
came
to
be
known
as
the
list
which
did
not
in
the
least
help
the
progress
of
what
they
were
waiting
for
during
these
days
of
which
lasted
about
a
month
the
event
occurred
which
might
so
easily
have
put
the
lid
on
the
whole
scheme
but
which
did
in
fact
probably
prove
to
be
its
salvation
an
officer
returning
from
his
shift
to
the
entrance
was
recognised
by
a
sentry
the
sentry
reported
the
episode
but
could
not
give
the
name
niemeyer
quickly
appeared
on
the
scene
attended
by
the
camp
officers
and
conducted
a
and
thorough
investigation
on
the
spot
and
the
british
were
kept
standing
on
of
them
concerned
in
an
agony
of
the
conclusion
of
the
enquiry
so
well
however
was
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
concealed
and
so
inconclusive
was
the
evidence
supplied
by
the
sentry
that
niemeyer
failed
badly
to
take
advantage
of
the
one
real
clue
ever
presented
to
him
in
the
history
of
the
tunnel
he
knew
the
english
too
well
to
think
for
a
moment
of
parading
the
whole
camp
before
the
miserable
sentry
on
the
chance
of
an
identification
such
an
attempt
would
have
meant
a
crowded
hour
or
so
of
sheer
delight
for
the
british
and
of
baffled
exasperation
for
himself
he
ultimately
came
to
the
conclusion
that
if
there
was
anything
in
the
statement
there
was
probably
some
embryo
stunt
afoot
in
this
he
was
not
far
wrong
and
contented
himself
with
the
precaution
of
placing
an
additional
sentry
at
the
door
the
conspirators
breathed
again
all
was
not
yet
lost
when
nothing
further
at
all
suspicious
was
reported
the
mood
of
the
versatile
niemeyer
again
reacted
and
the
informing
sentry
was
given
eight
days
in
cells
for
making
a
false
report
this
act
besides
being
typically
unjust
was
also
one
of
questionable
policy
since
it
naturally
tended
to
make
other
sentries
uncommunicative
of
anything
suspicious
that
they
might
see
or
hear
punishment
in
cells
with
them
was
an
infinitely
more
serious
affair
than
it
was
with
us
they
had
only
their
own
miserable
ration
and
were
cut
off
even
from
the
slender
assistance
of
the
home
parcels
on
which
most
if
not
all
of
them
relied
to
keep
their
bodies
and
souls
together
the
immediate
upshot
so
far
as
the
tunnel
and
the
additional
sentry
were
concerned
was
that
so
long
as
the
sentry
remained
posted
over
the
entrance
the
tunnel
could
not
possibly
be
got
at
by
the
previous
method
a
new
entrance
to
the
chamber
had
to
be
made
and
this
was
set
about
at
once
a
hole
was
begun
through
the
wall
of
the
last
of
the
big
living
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
which
adjoined
directly
on
to
the
chamber
this
hole
would
give
entry
to
the
chamber
somewhere
underneath
the
staircase
flight
it
should
be
explained
here
that
the
only
reason
which
had
prevented
this
hole
being
attempted
at
a
much
earlier
stage
in
the
proceedings
was
the
obvious
and
almost
certain
risk
of
any
such
hole
being
discovered
in
a
search
and
thereby
ruining
the
whole
scheme
only
the
present
desperate
state
of
affairs
justified
the
risk
being
taken
at
all
the
inhabitants
of
room
the
big
room
in
question
had
of
course
to
be
let
into
the
secret
if
secret
it
could
any
longer
be
called
one
member
of
the
patrol
now
sat
in
a
at
the
end
of
the

opposite
the
door

could
command
the
whole
length
of
the
passage
and
dart
in
at
once
to
warn
the
workers
inside
if
any
german
hove
in
sight
a
different
officer
every
hour
sitting
at
this
particular
spot
in
the
corridor
reading
a
book
and
apparently
perfectly
resigned
to
the
discomfort
of
the
site
and
the
disturbance
to
his
reading
caused
by
the
perpetual
the
germans
who
did
occasionally
come
along
had
stopped
for
a
moment
to
think
but
the
fact
is
that
the
reprisals
were
militating
for
us
as
well
as
against
us
the
german
personnel
were
not
enjoying
the
any
more
than
we
were
counting
officers
five
times
a
day
even
in
the
most
superficial
manner
was
a
task
that
was
obviously
trying
the
patience
of
both
the
feldwebels
and
the
lager
officers
very
severely
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
during
this
period
they
left
us
well
alone
when
they
were
given
the
opportunity
on
the
argument
that
both
sides
had
a
grievance
personal
relations
between
the
british
and
germans
with
the
exception
of
course
of
niemeyer
improved
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
the
supervision
was
more
cursory
and
the
letter
of
the
law
more
loosely
interpreted
than
at
any
previous
time
in
the
history
the
then
senior
british
officer
colonel
rathborne
was
himself
deeply
interested
in
the
success
of
the
scheme
and
had
in
fact
been
offered
a
place
immediately
after
the
original
it
was
his
obvious
policy
to
foster
as
much
as
possible
the
existing
state
of
good
relationship
and
to
avoid
serious
collision
with
the
authorities
consequently
the
reprisals
were
left
to
work
out
their
own
sweet
course
niemeyer
was
ignored
when
a
hammer
disappeared
from
the
of
a
civilian
carpenter
working
in
the
camp
and
the
welman
demanded
its
instant
restoration
on
pain
of
a
general
search
the
hammer
was
immediately
produced
a
german
tin
room
attendant
had
his
cap
whisked
off
his
head
by
some
adventurous
and
unidentified
spirit
the
threats
of
a
general
search
were
repeated
and
the
cap
as
promptly
restored
the
jewboy
and
the
germans
generally
were
welcome
to
draw
any
conclusions
they
wished
as
to
our
impaired
morale
their
conclusions
were
of
secondary
importance
but
a
general
search
at
such
a
time
would
have
been
a
disaster
of
the
first
magnitude
and
room
could
hardly
have
got
through
with
its
secret
unnoticed
however
the
attempt
to
make
an
entry
into
the
chamber
from
room
proved
abortive
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
digging
through
the
solid
concrete
of
the
wall
with
the
available
tools
so
after
desperate
efforts
for
about
a
week
the
habit
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
and
the
turned
their
attention
to
the
attic
which
was
now
the
one
remaining
available
avenue
of
approach
leading
to
the
attic
floor
from
the
staircase
were
two
swing
doors
as
the
attic
floor
had
now
been
placed
altogether
out
of
bounds
for
officers
these
doors
were
padlocked
and
secured
by
a
chain
which
passed
through
the
two
large
of
the
doors
the
doors
were
forced
by
unscrewing
one
of
these
handles
which
were
fastened
by
six
screws
through
their
the
screws
had
to
be
replaced
every
time
the
conspirators
went
in
or
out
entry
was
then
possible
into
one
of
the
now
disused
small
rooms
a
hole
was
knocked
through
the
wall
of
this
room
into
a
space
between
the
wall
of
the
attic
the
roof
and
the
eaves
thus
illustration
this
space
communicated
with
the
quarters
by
means
of
a
small
door
which
had
been
built
into
the
house
to
permit
of
access
to
the
eaves
the
hole
in
the
vacant
room
was
camouflaged
with
a
bit
of
board
cut
to
size
and
covered
with
glue
on
which
was
sprinkled
mortar
and
distemper
to
tone
with
the
wall
of
the
room
the
use
of
this
room
as
the
means
of
access
to
the
quarters
and
so
the
staircase
and
the
same
old
secret
door
to
the
tunnel
made
up
in
full
for
the
previous
delay
and
immensely
accelerated
the
rate
of
progress
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
work
by
means
of
carefully
timed
and
reliefs
the
work
could
now
go
on
all
day
and
all
night
with
interruptions
only
to
admit
of
attendance
on
when
the
reprisal
restrictions
were
removed
things
would
go
on
even
more
swimmingly
as
it
in
spite
of
continued
trouble
with
the
tunnel
was
already
estimated
to
be
nosing
its
way
to
within
measurable
distance
of
the
coveted
rye
when
the
suspicion
at
length
subsided
and
the
extra
sentry
was
removed
from
the
entrance
the
decision
had
to
be
made
whether
to
revert
to
the
old
method
of
getting
to
the
tunnel
or
to
stay
with
the
quicker
method
and
risk
a
search
it
goes
almost
without
saying
that
the
latter
counsel
prevailed
it
was
now
and
with
any
luck
it
was
hoped
that
the
tunnel
would
have
been
taken
far
enough
by
the
first
week
in
july
if
they
went
back
to
the
old
method
it
might
not
be
ready
before
august
at
the
worst
the
letter
boy
or
some
other
agent
might
be
safely
relied
upon
to
give
notice
of
a
search
during
which
time
much
might
be
done
still
further
to
conceal
the
traces
of
the
attempted
hole
in
room
this
had
already
been
fairly
effectually
the
actual
hole
in
the
attic
but
it
was
unlikely
since
these
attic
rooms
were
now
out
of
bounds
and
the
swing
doors
apparently
securely
padlocked
that
a
search
would
extend
so
far
it
might
be
asked
why
had
not
this
decision
been
taken
before
and
why
in
the
early
stages
the
cumbrous
method
of
approaching
the
tunnel
in
clothes
under
the
very
nose
of
a
sentry
had
been
preferred
the
answer
to
this
very
reasonable
question
is
that
three
weeks
is
not
eight
months
at
this
juncture
it
was
reasonable
odds
against
a
search
being
held
before
the
tunnel
was
completed
in
november
it
was
all
the
odds
on
actually
since
operations
had
been
begun
there
had
been
two
searches
both
of
regards
the
ground
floor
at
any
thorough
no
hole
in
a
wall
could
have
hoped
to
escape
the
sleuth
hounds
specially
sent
down
from
berlin
for
these
occasions
they
may
have
got
the
worst
of
it
in
some
of
the
personal
they
very
rarely
did
discover
any
of
a
contraband
nature
the
british
officers
who
owned
any
as
a
rule
took
care
not
to
be
collared
in
possession
and
very
often
the
war
was
carried
into
the
country
and
the
civilian
detectives
found
on
leaving
a
room
that
they
had
somehow
managed
to
mislay
an
umbrella
or
a
hat
or
some
other
object
of
civilian
attire
useful
for
of
which
it
need
hardly
be
said
provided
scope
for
a
most
exhilarating
exchange
of
amenities
and
sometimes
for
grave
allegations
against
the
moral
proclivities
of
the
british
prisoners
but
with
bricks
and
mortar
our
friends
were
on
surer
ground
and
they
would
not
have
needed
very
high
qualifications
to
have
spotted
a
gaping
hole
in
a
wall
camouflaged
behind
a
bed
so
our
tunnellers
had
had
to
go
outside
to
get
to
their
work
and
the
plank
door
had
been
decided
upon
searches
though
they
meant
confinement
to
the
buildings
for
the
best
part
of
the
day
and
made
cooking
a
decent
meal
at
the
stoves
impossible
were
nevertheless
welcomed
by
all
except
those
who
had
much
to
lose
and
no
time
to
hide
it
in
as
a
pleasant
variation
to
the
monotonous
round
for
one
thing
they
introduced
for
a
brief
space
a
foreign
element
into
the
camp
quaint
little
spectacled
civilians
from
berlin
full
of
zeal
for
their
duties
for
an
hour
or
so
but
tiring
rapidly
as
the
same
ritual
was
gone
through
in
room
after
room
of
polite
but
mildly
amused
prisoners
could
be
induced
with
a
little
persuasion
to
talk
of
food
conditions
in
the
capital
their
opinion
on
the
war
and
other
interesting
subjects
the
full
dress
uniform
of
a
police
officer
provided
a
pleasing
variation
to
the
eternal
field
grey
or
some
captain
from
hanover
in
charge
of
the
company
specially
detailed
for
the
search
interested
simply
because
his
face
was
new
to
us
for
any
material
result
both
the
searches
held
at
holzminden
were
an
absolute
farce
of
one
of
them
we
had
full
warning
an
enormous
quantity
of
books
were
temporarily
confiscated
for
examination
and
removed
to
the
parcel
room
one
or
two
maps
which
had
been
carelessly
left
uncovered
were
duly
netted
but
anything
of
real
importance
such
as
civilian
hats
clothes
compasses
and
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
maps
were
securely
hidden
before
the
search
ever
began
and
all
that
happened
was
that
every
officer
in
the
camp
was
invited
to
undress
and
then
to
dress
again
these
ordeals
were
great
fun
when
it
got
to
the
final
stages
and
the
victim
was
in
his
undergarments
he
was
invited
to
give
his
parole
that
he
had
nothing
actually
concealed
about
his
person
with
some
of
us
delicacy
conquered
others
were
less
fastidious
and
requested
the
german
to
continue
his
ungrateful
task
to
the
bitter
end
long
before
the
attic
both
houses
the
richest
in
contraband
reached
the
had
tired
of
the
beauty
of
the
human
form
and
proceedings
had
become
entirely
formal
one
officer
prominent
in
this
story
was
taken
by
surprise
at
one
of
these
searches
with
a
whole
escape
kit
under
his
bed
but
he
had
also
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
a
large
black
wooden
box
which
had
a
double
bottom
luckily
when
the
sleuths
entered
his
room
the
first
thing
that
caught
their
eye
was
the
big
black
box
they
turned
everything
out
of
it
and
tapped
the
bottom
after
a
frenzied
argument
lasting
quite
half
an
hour
between
a
detective
from
berlin
who
said
there
was
a
double
bottom
and
the
double
bottom
expert
who
being
called
over
to
examine
it
said
there
was
not
the
former
triumphantly
put
his
foot
through
the
false
bottom
it
hid
one
or
two
books
prayer
books
etc
and
some
private
papers
of
no
particular
interest
these
articles
were
carried
off
in
triumph
and
every
hun
present
shook
the
hand
as
if
he
had
scored
a
goal
for
blackburn
rovers
they
were
so
pleased
that
they
to
look
under
the
it
should
be
added
that
on
these
occasions
the
camp
personnel
could
be
relied
upon
to
do
their
utmost
in
helping
to
baffle
the
search
thus
for
instance
a
sentry
a
cake
of
soap
or
a
stick
of
easily
induced
to
act
as
temporary
banker
for
a
large
number
of
german
notes
of
the
realm
feldwebels
could
be
persuaded
to
give
permission
for
an
officer
to
visit
the
latrine
under
guard
well
knowing
that
he
had
only
gone
to
put
something
out
on
short
deposit
in
a
reliable
quarter
in
some
cases
the
feldwebel
was
even
known
to
take
the
risk
of
the
market
himself
it
was
a
curious
phenomenon
in
fact
that
on
such
gala
days
the
camp
personnel
became
infinitely
more
indulgent
than
on
ordinary
working
days
it
was
as
if
they
were
disposed
to
make
common
cause
with
us
against
niemeyer
and
his
imported
mercenaries
in
doing
so
the
camp
sentries
did
not
forget
to
help
themselves
unasked
whenever
they
had
an
opportunity
whilst
we
were
shut
up
in
our
rooms
they
had
ample
access
to
the
dining
rooms
and
it
was
an
amusing
climax
to
the
sport
to
see
the
whole
of
the
guard
marched
off
to
the
parcel
room
after
the
search
to
be
themselves
searched
in
their
turn
their
pockets
simply
bulging
with
stolen
tins
or
eatables
and
in
many
cases
the
delinquents
making
frantic
efforts
to
eat
a
two
supply
in
two
minutes
and
incur
the
penalty
of
indigestion
rather
than
that
of
nine
cells
for
being
found
in
possession
of
stolen
goods
the
whole
business
was
rather
gilbertian
i
do
not
think
it
could
have
happened
in
england
even
if
there
had
been
a
famine
there
niemeyer
must
have
realised
the
futility
of
these
for
there
were
no
searches
held
between
a
date
in
march
and
the
time
of
the
tunnel
escape
on
one
occasion
all
the
preparations
for
one
had
been
made
and
the
information
duly
passed
on
through
the
usual
channels
to
us
but
niemeyer
in
his
turn
came
to
know
that
we
knew
and
not
only
cancelled
the
operations
but
told
us
frankly
that
he
had
done
so
we
had
sometimes
to
give
the
devil
his
due
for
a
sense
of
humour
chapter
viii
the
last
lap
after
a
brief
spell
of
smoother
working
both
above
and
below
the
surface
things
began
to
go
wrong
again
in
the
first
place
the
exasperating
stratum
of
stones
recurred
and
persisted
the
tunnel
was
now
being
inclined
upwards
from
rough
measurements
it
had
been
estimated
that
the
face
must
now
be
approaching
the
desired
spot
and
be
nearly
abreast
with
the
edge
of
the
but
the
obstinate
stratum
added
to
the
difficulty
of
working
uphill
and
reduced
the
rate
of
progress
almost
to
the
lowest
on
record
and
work
as
they
might
it
was
the
last
week
in
june
before
those
directing
decided
that
the
distance
had
been
accomplished
and
the
tunnel
might
be
inclined
to
the
surface
on
the
last
day
in
june
lieutenant
butler
one
of
the
leading
spirits
in
the
concern
went
up
to
the
face
on
the
important
duty
of
breaking
the
surface
and
pinpointing
the
position
the
tunnel
had
at
length
been
pushed
through
the
clogging
stratum
a
total
ascent
of
nine
feet
had
been
made
from
the
lowest
point
and
it
was
judged
that
the
end
of
it
must
now
be
very
near
the
surface
to
confirm
this
a
narrow
hole
was
bored
straight
upwards
from
the
face
it
was
found
that
there
were
still
six
feet
of
clay
and
soil
to
be
negotiated
this
was
disappointing
but
it
was
not
so
disappointing
as
was
the
result
of
verifying
the
actual
position
butler
very
gingery
pushed
a
stick
with
a
piece
of
white
paper
attached
to
it
up
through
the
hole
the
watchers
from
one
of
the
upper
windows
groaned
as
they
discerned
the
damning
piece
of
paper
moving
slowly
to
and
fro
eight
or
nine
yards
short
of
the
the
interest
and
general
tension
had
now
become
so
great
that
although
nothing
was
said
half
the
camp
knew
the
same
evening
that
something
was
wrong
and
guessed
fairly
shrewdly
what
the
something
was
to
carry
on
into
the
rye
would
take
at
least
three
hard
work
by
which
time
the
rye
would
probably
have
been
cut
and
the
only
cover
afforded
would
be
the
darkness
of
the
night
but
about
three
or
four
yards
nearer
than
the
rye
was
a
row
of
beans
and
it
was
decided
to
make
a
last
effort
to
reach
these
and
to
trust
to
luck
and
the
darkness
to
carry
the
party
across
the
bare
space
between
the
beans
and
rye
the
beans
in
themselves
would
afford
no
mean
screen
meanwhile
gray
another
of
the
conspirators
the
father
of
the
tunnel
and
in
every
way
one
of
the
most
important
personages
concerned
fell
due
for
a
fortnight
of
solitary
confinement
he
had
some
time
ago
had
a
violent
altercation
with
the
most
odious
of
the
parcel
room
attendants
and
had
in
the
course
of
it
handled
a
large
knife
which
was
lying
on
the
parcel
room
counter
the
attendant
promptly
brought
a
charge
against
him
for
attempted
homicide
word
as
well
as
the
body
of
even
the
vilest
german
being
sacrosanct
when
brought
into
collision
with
those
of

in
due
course
brought
up
before
a

says
something
for
his
judges
on
this
occasion
that
they
did
not
give
him
more
than
a
fortnight
which
in
reality
amounted
to
acquittal
there
existed
tribunals
which
would
have
given
him
six
months
of
the
best
without
the
slightest
twinge
of
conscience
melancholy
the
thought
of
having
been
in
the
least
unjust
this
was
but
an
instance
of
the
perversions
of
all
the
accepted
canons
of
fair
play
which
frequently
occurred
fortunately
for
gray
and
the
tunnel
it
was
a
mild
sample
so
the
munshi
languished
and
knew
nothing
of
what
was
passing
in
the
tunnel
except
from
guarded
scraps
of
hindostani
spoken
to
him
in
an
even
voice
from
the
window
of
the
camp
room
immediately
above
his
cell
finally
tim
and
his
young
woman
made
their
long
deliberated
effort
and
were
caught
most
unluckily
at
the
main
gate
thereby
throwing
the
camp
officials
and
niemeyer
in
particular
into
a
most
undesirable
mood
of
added
watchfulness
everything
had
gone
according
to
plan
up
to
a
kommandantur
staircase
had
again
been
made
use
of
and
a
most
seductive
little
flapper
typist
had
tripped
his
unassuming
way
unchallenged
through
the
gate
tim
himself
dressed
in
a
german
uniform
but
otherwise
unmistakably
tim
had
attempted
to
follow
suit
but
he
was
unable
to
avoid
his
doom
in
the
shape
of
one
too
curious
and
too
intelligent
pair
of
eyes
at
the
window
their
owner
recognised
him
as
an
english
officer
and
promptly
gave
the
alarm
result
the
usual
tim
débacle
and
the
work
of
months
once
again
nullified
the
pair
were
marched
off
to
the
cells
under
escort
amidst
sympathetic
expressions
from
every
side
even
ulrich
the
german
officer
of
b
kaserne
was
loud
in
his
admiration
of
the
disguises
used
had
of
course
suspected
something
was
up
for
of
course
lieutenant
lincke
the
officer
who
had
succeeded
the
gröner
in
charge
of
a
kaserne
a
pharmacist
by
trade
and
the
personification
of
pompous
absurdity
seized
the
opportunity
to
show
his
ignorance
of
the
english
and
his
unsuitability
for
his
post
by
intimating
that
the
female
disguise
had
been
culled
from
the
theatrical
wardrobe
allowed
us
on
parole
once
again
and
in
accordance
with
cherished
tradition
war
had
to
be
waged
on
the
parole
question
and
the
artificially
good
relations
which
were
being
promoted
in
the
interests
of
the
tunnel
were
temporarily
suspended
until
lincke
could
be
induced
to
retract
his
entirely
inexcusable
inference
it
must
be
explained
that
the
whole
of
the
theatrical
wardrobe
both
for
male
and
female
parts
was
kept
strictly
apart
under
lock
and
key
and
under
the
supervision
of
a
particular
officer
it
had
always
been
a
strict
injunction
of
each
successive
senior
british
officer
that
on
no
account
was
there
to
be
any
tampering
with
these
clothes
for
the
purposes
of
escape
and
that
any
infringement
of
this
order
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
breaking
of
parole
this
unwritten
but
none
the
less
thoroughly
understood
reservation
was
as
clear
as
it
was
necessary
in
the
interests
of
that
large
section
of
the
community
which
relied
on
the
periodical
as
performers
or
their
principal
means
of
relief
from
the
of
prison
existence
the
disguise
of
accomplice
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
been
smuggled
in
from
the
town
at
a
considerable
expenditure
in
german
money
and
british
kind
but
lincke
having
been
till
within
the
last
year
a
german
pharmacist
in
a
small
way
of
business
had
about
as
much
idea
of
british
not
to
say
german
military
honour
as
he
had
of
field
operations
his
training
had
consisted
of
three
or
four
months
in
a
reserve
of
officers
training
battalion
and
he
came
out
of
it
vibrant
with
the
glory
of
two
german
military
system
and
himself
as
reflecting
a
modest
proportion
of
that
glory
he
was
perfectly
genial
and
common
on
he
insisted
on
believing
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
company
of
recruits
on
parade
and
the
long
shuffling
indifferent
rows
of
british
officers
winced
or
laughed
at
his
antics
according
to
the
state
of
their
nerves
he
used
to
begin
operations
by
a
salute
with
the
top
half
of
his
person
inclined
almost
at
right
angles
with
the
ground
some
of
the
lighter
spirits
used
to
go
one
better
and
execute
a
complete
and
this
of
course
made
him
querulous
he
would
recall
to
the
senior
officer
on
parade
the
great
day
when
he
and
his
brother
stood
poker
stiff
at
attention
under
inspection
by
one
of
the
very
biggest
of
the
german
generals
a
that
was
his
a
had
moved
and
so
why
could
not
now
the
british
officers
do
likewise
instead
of
appearing
on
parade
in
dirty
uniforms
and
without
caps
and
saluting
so
raggedly
oh
it
was
too
bad
he
was
of
course
a
complete
nonentity
and
disregarded
alike
by
niemeyer
and
the
british
as
well
as
by
his
officers
but
even
nonentities
exercise
awkward
powers
if
placed
in
positions
where
they
should
not
be
and
lincke
for
all
his
mildness
was
about
as
troublesome
to
deal
with
as
a
junker
of
the
real
prussian
school
his
pharmaceutical
soul
and
his
hopeless
inability
to
understand
the
british
point
of
view
made
him
in
fact
a
serious
thorn
in
the
flesh
as
was
evidenced
in
the
wardrobe
incident
ultimately
he
crashed
badly
he
was
in
the
habit
of
paying
frequent
visits
to
the
tin
room
nominally
to
inspect
actually
to
satisfy
his
craving
for
the
sight
of
our
english
delicacies
he
was
insatiably
inquisitive
as
well
as
greedy
and
used
to
spend
hours
together
down
in
the
cellars
questioning
officers
as
to
the
contents
and
origin
of
particular
tins
finally
there
became
reason
to
suspect
him
of
something
rather
more
serious
than
mere
curiosity
a
trap
was
set
and
he
was
marked
down
by
three
witnesses
in
the
act
of
abstracting
tins
from
one
of
the
shelves
and
putting
them
hurriedly
in
his
pocket
this
gave
us
a
most
valuable
handle
for
even
at
holzminden
the
german
officers
had
never
stolen
our
tins
from
our
own
tin
room
or
if
they
had
had
not
been
such
fools
as
to
be
caught
doing
so
in
due
course
and
at
a
seasonable
moment
the
card
was
played
the
written
statement
of
the
witnesses
handed
in
and
an
explanation
asked
for
niemeyer
took
a
day
or
two
before
he
passed
between
himself
and
the
luckless
lincke
in
the
interval
we
could
only
then
explained
that
it
was
in
the
regulations
for
german
officers
at
any
time
to
take
tins
out
of
the
tin
room
in
order
personally
to
examine
them
for
contraband
articles
the
senior
british
officer
politely
noted
this
explanation
and
asked
leave
to
refer
the
question
to
the
for
a
ruling
lincke
meanwhile
was
relieved
of
his
post
it
was
one
of
the
few
occasions
besides
the
tunnel
upon
which
we
ever
succeeded
in
getting
really
up
on
them
the
capture
of
tim
caused
gloomy
anticipation
of
a
search
and
with
it
the
discovery
of
the
attempted
hole
in
room
and
thereby
as
a
natural
corollary
of
the
tunnel
itself
in
the
second
week
of
three
yards
or
so
further
to
go
before
an
exit
could
be
made
behind
the
beans
with
the
prospect
of
a
search
imminent
at
any
moment
and
with
the
added
danger
of
an
early
harvest
to
spur
their
began
to
make
their
final
arrangements
a
ten
and
the
thing
would
be
put
to
the
proof
for
better
or
worse
there
were
thirteen
of
them
lieutenants
mardock
and
lawrence
of
the
royal
naval
air
service
captain
gray
lieutenant
butler
captain
langren
lieutenant
wainwright
lieutenant
macleod
captain
bain
captain
kennard
lieutenant
robertson
lieutenant
clouston
lieutenant
morris
lieutenant
paddison
they
voted
for
priority
of
station
after
the
proper
places
were
allotted
to
rathborne
the
senior
officer
of
the
camp
lieutenant
bousfield
whose
share
in
a
previous
attempt
has
been
narrated
earlier
and
captain
lyon
of
the
australians
who
was
to
travel
with
bousfield
then
came
a
supplementary
of
six
who
though
not
actually
employed
in
the
digging
of
the
tunnel
had
contributed
valuable
assistance
in
and
had
made
themselves
generally
useful
in
helping
to
dig
the
holes
inside
the
actual
building
it
was
arranged
that
the
original
should
have
a
clear
start
and
that
another
hour
should
intervene
between
the
last
man
out
of
the
supplementary
and
in
other
words
anyone
else
who
wanted
to
by
now
assumed
alarming
dimensions
there
were
some
sixty
names
on
the
official
list
handed
to
me
as
camp
adjutant
on
the
day
preceding
the
escape
the
list
had
been
arranged
in
order
of
priority
of
exit
and
to
prevent
well
as
to
promote
the
maximum
of
was
arranged
that
those
on
the
list
should
only
be
warned
in
the
first
instance
the
evening
on
the
night
of
the
actual
escape
moreover
no
one
was
to
be
told
his
place
but
only
that
he
was
to
lie
in
bed
fully
dressed
until
he
was
actually
warned
to
go
upon
which
he
was
to
get
up
at
once
and
repair
to
the
rendezvous
on
the
attic
floor
this
was
a
very
wise
precaution
it
excluded
the
possibility
of
anyone
in
a
kaserne
getting
wind
of
the
intention
to
flit
and
then
endeavouring
to
get
into
the
other
barrack
for
the
night
and
so
endangering
the
success
of
the
enterprise
it
also
precluded
the
risk
of
excessive
human
circulation
in
the
corridors
the
only
people
authorised
to
move
about
in
the
corridors
being
myself
lieutenant
grieve
who
was
selected
as
traffic
controller
one
or
two
men
and
each
escaper
as
in
his
proper
turn
he
left
his
bed
to
pass
to
the
tunnel
the
orderlies
had
been
thoroughly
warned
and
those
of
them
who
had
volunteered
to
help
fully
understood
their
duties
one
was
to
receive
officers
one
by
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
hole
in
the
attic
room
and
was
to
signal
the
next
man
to
come
through
when
the
coast
was
clear
another
was
to
guide
officers
to
the
tunnel
entrance
down
the
staircase
and
through
the
planks
and
two
more
were
to
be
on
duty
at
the
actual
tunnel
entrance
traffic
was
to
be
carefully
controlled
not
more
than
two
officers
were
to
be
allowed
inside
the
quarters
at
a
time
if
there
was
a
hitch
lieutenant
grieve
on
the
far
side
of
the
attic
hole
was
to
be
immediately
warned
on
discovery
all
the
orderlies
were
to
pretend
complete
ignorance
of
the
whole
business
this
last
goes
without
saying
just
as
the
loyal
of
the
orderlies
was
essential
to
success
so
it
was
imperative
that
none
of
them
should
be
implicated
they
had
all
been
offered
a
if
they
cared
to
accept
one
but
none
of
them
did
the
long
expected
almost
despaired
of
exchange
had
at
last
been
arranged
at
the
hague
and
the
agreement
was
now
only
awaiting
ratification
the
fact
that
privates
had
been
up
till
now
excluded
from
the
terms
of
the
exchange
had
of
course
been
very
severely
criticised
and
it
was
not
until
later
realised
that
the
arrangements
for
a
general
repatriation
had
been
frustrated
entirely
from
the
german
side
but
the
rule
of
and
children
our
orderlies
half
good
naturedly
half
cynically
and
with
that
wonderful
instinct
for
the
epigrammatic
which
characterises
the
british
soldier
had
summarised
the
now
obsolete
to
have
imperilled
their
chances
of
exchange
by
taking
a
long
risk
at
this
stage
of
their
captivity
nearly
all
of
them
were
prisoners
would
have
been
very
unwise
even
had
they
been
as
well
equipped
as
the
officers
as
regards
disguise
money
reserves
of
food
and
general
experience
moreover
the
penalties
for
attempted
escape
were
for
private
soldiers
infinitely
more
severe
than
they
were
for
officers
they
would
have
certainly
been
sent
back
to
one
of
the
and
their
previous
experiences
reminded
them
that
any
considerably
better
than
the
best
and
there
were
always
the
coal
and
salt
mines
to
be
taken
into
calculation
so
they
stayed
behind
and
their
share
in
the
work
amply
crowned
their
long
record
of
ungrudged
service
and
devotion
to
the
cause
during
the
last
few
days
when
it
was
generally
known
that
at
any
moment
the
cat
might
jump
and
it
became
a
question
of
concealing
day
from
your
own
side
the
tension
was
positively
painful
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
the
injunctions
of
the
senior
british
officer
came
to
be
overlooked
even
the
senior
british
officer
himself
was
not
innocent
in
this
respect
small
parties
clustered
at
the
ends
of
corridors
or
roamed
disconsolately
round
and
round
the
camp
discussing
the
eternal
question
civilian
disguises
maps
and
packs
were
brought
out
from
their
and
set
ready
for
the
road
more
risks
of
detection
were
run
during
this
period
in
a
day
than
had
been
run
before
in
a
whole
month
maps
were
studied
an
unwise
and
rather
insubordinate
attempt
on
the
part
of
one
or
two
of
the
more
desperate
characters
in
kaserne
a
to
effect
a
transfer
of
rooms
to
kaserne
b
was
fortunately
quashed
the
senior
british
officer
who
was
somewhat
in
shape
was
given
a
trial
run
down
the
tunnel
to
see
if
he
could
manage
it
it
took
him
an
hour
to
get
back
walks
had
been
allowed
again
as
a
consequence
of
the
of
the
reprisals
and
most
of
the
intending
starters
availed
themselves
of
this
opportunity
to
get
into
good
marching
trim
fit
as
they
were
in
consequence
of
the
strenuous
work
down
below
they
felt
the
need
of
using
every
available
opportunity
for
a
good
movement
over
a
stretch
of
unconfined
ground
the
holland
border
was
kilometres
away
and
would
not
easily
be
reached
by
those
who
had
let
their
walking
muscles
lie
too
long
dormant
in
addition
it
was
pleasant
to
get
away
for
a
space
from
the
strained
atmosphere
of
the
enclosure
and
the
tremendous
secret
of
the
camp
and
without
constraint
to
think
and
talk
for
a
little
of
other
things
in
high
midsummer
the
plain
in
which
we
walked
was
only
less
lovely
than
it
had
been
in
the
spring
as
then
the
trees
so
now
the
young
crops
invited
us
to
build
up
a
new
calendar
in
terms
of
growing
things
we
may
not
have
felt
the
need
perhaps
in
the
years
gone
by
to
pay
due
note
to
the
wonderful
kaleidoscope
now
the
very
circumscription
of
her
lecturing
hours
made
lessons
the
more
highly
prized
sometimes
when
the
weather
was
warm
and
the
feldwebel
in
charge
sufficiently
lazy
and
complacent
we
bathed
in
the
for
river
bathing
was
not
allowed
by
the
municipal
authorities
then
for
a
glorious
the
river
would
be
alive
with
the
nude
bodies
of
a
hundred
happy
men
it
was
established
at
these
bathes
that
the
river
was
easily
fordable
at
one
point
in
our
parole
cards
there
was
nothing
down
to
tell
us
not
to
things
and
the
river
lay
between
the
camp
and
holland
at
the
last
moment
another
painful
incident
occurred
it
became
known
that
a
certain
desperate
party
in
a
kaserne
were
proposing
to
anticipate
the
tunnel
and
the
increased
restrictions
which
its
discovery
would
be
bound
to
create
by
some
scheme
of
their
own
it
appeared
to
be
their
intention
to
fuse
the
lights
all
over
the
building
and
make
a
bid
to
get
over
the
wire
in
the
darkness
and
confusion
thus
created
there
was
also
going
to
be
employed
a
in
the
shape
of
a
large
dummy
figure
dropped
from
a
window
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
building
to
that
at
which
the
actual
attempt
was
to
be
made
the
scheme
in
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
been
worth
trying
and
was
a
courageous
one
but
at
this
juncture
of
affairs
when
the
work
of
nine
months
was
on
the
verge
of
bearing
fruit
and
when
the
one
thing
needed
was
to
lull
the
suspicions
of
the
authorities
it
was
foolish
and
selfish
to
make
matters
worse
the
participants
had
received
the
unofficial
support
of
the
senior
officer
in
the
building
the
senior
british
officer
in
the
camp
however
took
a
very
different
line
he
had
the
ringleader
up
and
put
the
argument
fairly
and
forcibly
before
him
he
sympathised
of
course
was
a
train
already
in
the
tunnel
the
line
was
not
quite
clear
for
it
yet
but
would
be
shortly
and
it
must
be
let
through
first
it
was
very
important
not
to
have
a
collision
at
this
moment
and
the
advent
of
another
train
might
spell
disaster
he
must
definitely
forbid
any
prior
attempt
but
for
the
ringleader
the
tunnel
would
have
been
essayed
a
night
earlier
than
it
actually
was
on
the
doors
of
the
houses
being
locked
at
nightfall
on
the
july
it
was
found
that
the
fellow
was
in
b
kaserne
he
had
got
wind
of
it
somehow
and
was
determined
to
be
in
at
the
death
the
only
course
was
to
cancel
the
operation
for
the
night
and
induce
this
officer
to
realise
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
explain
his
appearance
in
the
wrong
house
to
the
feldwebel
as
best
he
could
elaborate
measures
were
also
taken
to
put
him
off
the
scent
for
the
ensuing
night
disciplinary
methods
were
really
useless
with
this
type
besides
the
senior
officer
was
too
closely
occupied
in
the
final
arrangements
of
his
own
intricate
was
intending
to
travel
by
train
in
broad
daylight
and
not
as
a
thief
in
the
feel
any
inclination
for
taking
any
further
steps
with
this
refractory
individual
such
difficulties
may
sound
petty
perhaps
and
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
comradeship
but
it
was
not
in
human
nature
to
risk
the
fruits
of
eight
incessant
labour
to
benefit
the
crowd
nerves
were
badly
on
edge
and
the
wonder
really
is
that
this
particular
intruder
was
let
off
as
lightly
as
he
was
chapter
ix
the
escape
and
the
sequel
the
reader
will
excuse
if
at
this
point
in
the
story
the
first
person
pronoun
figures
rather
prominently
i
was
myself
at
this
time
the
adjutant
of
the
camp
and
as
such
had
been
fairly
thoroughly
coached
how
things
were
to
be
done
i
was
very
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
of
contributing
in
however
modest
a
degree
to
the
success
of
the
plot
the
glorious
nature
of
the
adventure
came
home
to
me
at
last
and
i
experienced
some
rather
severe
twinges
of
regret
that
i
had
not
availed
myself
more
fully
of
any
chances
that
i
might
have
had
of
actually
participating
there
had
been
times
of
late
when
i
had
almost
given
up
the
tunnel
there
had
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
difficulties
and
obstacles
in
completing
it
added
to
which
the
ordinary
routine
duties
of
adjutant
had
kept
me
too
fully
occupied
to
acquire
the
proper
atmosphere
and
spend
long
hours
over
preparing
maps
and
packs
and
securing
the
necessary
money
and
disguise
frankly
i
had
been
a
little
sceptical
later
on
in
another
camp
where
there
was
full
latitude
to
mature
scheme
and
the
germans
interfered
hardly
at
all
with
daily
doings
i
experienced
the
complete
escape
fever
but
that
is
another
story
the
actual
night
of
the
escape
was
the
july
i
was
warned
just
before
evening
at
that
if
b
house
harboured
no
aliens
that
night
the
escape
would
take
place
i
got
hold
of
grieve
during
the
evening
and
we
held
a
long
confabulation
as
to
how
the
policing
had
best
be
done
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
do
all
the
warning
and
escort
people
to
the
rendezvous
in
the
attic
and
that
he
should
do
the
actual
controlling
and
keep
in
communication
with
the
orderlies
the
evening
passed
away
and
i
think
anybody
outside
the
was
aware
that
anything
was
actually
in
the
wind
the
doors
in
b
house
were
safely
locked
at
without
a
single
intruder
from
a
house
several
people
had
been
keenly
on
the
watch
to
see
to
this
point
we
went
off
quietly
to
our
respective
rooms
to
have
our
names
called
after
the
feldwebel
and
his
minions
had
finally
left
the
building
there
was
still
another
hour
or
so
to
wait
before
the
coast
was
clear
for
action
a
german
sentry
used
to
come
round
some
time
after
to
close
all
the
windows
in
the
corridors
and
incidentally
remove
anything
that
he
saw
to
his
liking
which
might
be
lying
about
until
he
had
gone
it
would
be
unsafe
to
have
any
undue
movement
and
only
the
the
first
officer
to
go
through
the
the
two
next
on
the
list
would
go
down
to
the
chamber
before
he
was
well
clear
during
this
period
of
waiting
the
senior
british
officer
paid
me
a
visit
in
his
and
said
i
wished
him
good
luck
we
had
worked
together
for
two
months
or
more
and
had
discussed
the
tunnel
and
his
particular
plan
to
escape
countless
times
he
had
a
very
good
disguise
and
without
wishing
to
disparage
his
features
they
the
aid
of
teutonic
he
was
so
far
as
i
knew
the
only
one
who
was
proposing
to
travel
all
the
way
to
the
frontier
by
train
and
with
his
excellent
knowledge
of
german
and
forged
papers
he
looked
to
have
a
very
good
chance
i
sat
in
my
room
until
the
outside
door
had
slammed
behind
the
german
sentry
and
i
knew
the
would
have
already
begun
making
their
way
through
the
tunnel
for
the
last
time
then
i
began
going
round
the
rooms
and
warning
personally
every
man
on
the
list
they
were
to
get
their
kit
ready
and
get
into
bed
fully
dressed
and
then
wait
until
they
were
called
there
was
to
be
no
movement
in
the
corridors
of
any
sort
for
all
the
secrecy
that
had
been
attempted
they
were
most
of
them
more
than
half
expecting
the
call
probably
someone
had
seen
a
member
of
the
in
his
disguise
and
had
passed
on
the
information
a
few
of
them
wanted
to
know
where
they
were
in
the
list
but
i
told
them
that
they
were
not
to
know
and
had
only
to
obey
orders
everyone
would
have
to
come
upstairs
in
his
socks
carrying
his
boots
in
his
hand
after
i
had
completed
the
task
of
warning
everybody
i
went
up
to
see
grieve
it
was
now
past
eleven
he
told
me
that
the
were
all
well
away
already
and
that
the
thing
was
going
well
the
law
for
the
was
strictly
adhered
to
and
at
the
supplementary
began
to
go
through
they
too
were
all
through
by
about
at
or
thereabouts
i
began
my
duties
of
assembling
those
on
the
waiting
list
two
or
three
passed
through
all
right
and
then
the
orderly
on
the
side
of
the
attic
hole
passed
the
word
back
that
there
was
a
hitch
he
would
let
grieve
know
when
it
was
all
clear
again
the
next
man
due
to
go
through
had
overweighted
himself
and
his
pack
to
such
an
extent
that
the
delay
proved
perhaps
a
blessing
in
disguise
if
we
had
let
him
go
through
as
he
was
he
would
probably
have
stuck
in
the
tunnel
would
most
certainly
not
have
forded
the
weser
and
could
in
any
case
not
have
marched
for
more
than
three
days
we
sent
him
back
with
some
stern
advice
to
remove
a
dozen
tins
or
so
from
his
pack
discard
his
stick
and
take
off
his
hobnailed
boots
which
had
made
an
infernal
clatter
in
the
passage
a
few
more
such
performers
and
the
secret
would
be
out
no
news
came
through
from
the
tunnel
so
i
decided
to
turn
in
for
an
hour
or
so
and
grieve
arranged
for
a
message
to
be
sent
to
me
if
the
coast
was
clear
before
that
time
i
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
corridors
before
i
lay
down
there
were
the
sentries
outside
walking
up
and
down
with
their
chins
sunk
on
their
breasts
and
their
rifles
slung
on
their
backs
wonderfully
as
usual
it
was
odd
to
think
that
within
a
hundred
yards
our
fellows
were
wriggling
away
through
the
rye
clearly
nothing
had
been
suspected
so
far
it
was
a
calm
night
and
fairly
dark
i
lay
down
knowing
that
there
would
be
heaps
of
work
to
do
the
next
day
whatever
happened
and
that
i
should
want
my
wits
about
me
but
i
could
not
sleep
and
at
about
i
went
upstairs
to
see
grieve
again
he
reported
there
was
no
change
in
the
position
we
tried
to
get
an
answer
from
the
quarters
but
there
was
no
reply
it
was
rather
baffling
at
we
held
a
council
of
war
with
captain
sharp
who
was
one
of
those
due
to
go
through
early
in
the
list
and
we
it
was
against
the
instructions
given
us
which
had
been
that
the
orderlies
should
alone
be
responsible
for
letting
anyone
through
the
attic
sharp
should
go
through
to
reconnoitre
he
did
so
and
came
back
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
time
to
report
that
no
one
was
about
and
that
the
tunnel
was
empty
footnote
it
was
never
found
out
exactly
what
caused
the
check
and
i
do
not
think
it
ever
will
be
it
was
rather
a
nasty
moment
we
had
a
sudden
new
suspicion
of
insecurity
and
a
feeling
that
valuable
time
might
have
been
lost
it
now
wanted
about
two
hours
to
dawn
and
so
far
we
reckoned
that
only
were
out
of
the
camp
it
did
not
look
very
promising
for
most
of
the
waiting
list
in
the
absence
of
the
hardly
felt
justified
in
giving
them
further
sent
through
the
next
five
officers
on
the
waiting
list
headed
by
sharp
allowing
five
minutes
between
each
they
did
not
return
so
we
concluded
that
the
tunnel
was
still
clear
and
that
they
had
got
away
thus
bringing
the
total
number
to
about
half
a
dozen
more
had
followed
at
regular
intervals
and
it
was
getting
on
for
four
when
the
gardiner
of
the
back
to
report
that
the
tunnel
was
blocked
and
passage
impossible
according
to
his
report
the
tunnel
was
reverberating
with
groans
curses
and
expressions
of
encouragement
someone
apparently
was
stuck
in
front
and
was
urging
those
behind
him
to
get
back
in
order
to
let
him
out
those
behind
on
the
other
hand
like
the
tuscans
in
the
famous
lay
were
crying
in
no
uncertain
tones
and
urging
him
to
get
out
and
on
with
it
it
had
clearly
become
a
hopeless
impasse
it
seemed
best
therefore
at
this
juncture
to
call
a
halt
and
clear
the
course
before
daylight
so
as
to
defer
the
chance
of
discovery
till
the
last
possible
moment
recommendations
were
therefore
passed
along
to
evacuate
the
tunnel
but
here
arose
another
difficulty
those
now
labouring
in
the
tunnel
were
not
used
to
its
ways
it
was
hard
enough
to
wriggle
along
in
a
forward
direction
but
withdrawal
with
a
heavy
pack
in
tow
was
an
even
more
strenuous
proposition
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
with
muscles
attuned
by
long
practice
had
experienced
the
utmost
difficulty
in
pulling
out
the
sacks
of
earth
when
the
rope
method
broke
down
and
to
get
the
packs
out
was
an
absolute
necessity
for
otherwise
there
would
be
a
complete
block
both
before
and
behind
which
would
result
in
the
foremost
unfortunates
being
entombed
until
the
tunnel
was
discovered
and
they
were
dug
out
the
situation
called
for
desperate
measures
and
fortunately
the
right
man
was
at
hand
a
new
zealand
officer
called
garland
who
was
high
up
on
the
waiting
list
came
up
to
the
rendezvous
to
prospect
he
happened
to
be
about
as
strong
physically
as
any
other
two
officers
in
the
camp
and
possessed
the
biceps
of
a
hercules
he
at
once
volunteered
to
go
down
and
try
to
pull
out
the
man
after
about
half
an
hour
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
and
the
two
collaborators
in
this
severe
physical
exercise
crawled
back
through
the
attic
hole
completely
exhausted
and
dripping
with
sweat
there
still
remained
four
men
stuck
in
the
tunnel
it
was
already
getting
light
and
in
an
hour
and
a
german
was
due
to
open
the
outside
door
and
call
the
orderlies
it
was
essential
therefore
to
get
everyone
back
into
the
building
before
that
time
if
the
alarm
of
the
escape
was
not
raised
before
the
fugitives
now
at
large
would
have
all
the
better
opportunity
of
making
cover
some
distance
away
from
the
camp
before
they
lay
up
for
their
first
day
out
an
hour
past
a
from
an
upper
window
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
corridors
had
reported
that
two
figures
had
been
seen
in
the
dim
half
light
of
the
dawn
making
off
through
the
it
was
guessed
that
these
would
probably
be
the
last
pair
out
before
the
accident
had
happened
in
the
tunnel
which
had
barred
further
passage
if
this
couple
could
gain
the
duke
of
hunting
three
miles
the
hue
and
cry
was
out
they
could
lie
up
snugly
and
safely
and
their
predecessors
would
be
in
all
the
better
plight
the
work
of
extracting
the
remaining
four
went
on
slowly
and
laboriously
and
by
a
quarter
to
six
two
more
mudstained
objects
had
been
salved
and
had
been
sent
back
cursing
bitterly
to
their
rooms
to
get
rid
of
their
mud
and
cover
their
traces
it
appeared
that
the
tunnel
had
caved
in
about
of
the
way
the
bottom
of
the
slope
up
to
the
final
exit
stones
loosened
in
the
traffic
had
found
their
way
to
lowest
point
in
the
whole
tunnel
and
were
blocking
further
progress
a
landslip
on
the
most
modest
scale
would
be
quite
enough
to
block
up
the
tiny
hole
there
was
now
nothing
left
to
do
the
two
officers
still
in
the
tunnel
with
the
volunteers
assisting
them
to
get
out
would
have
to
be
left
to
take
their
chance
everybody
else
went
back
to
their
rooms
and
to
bed
hugging
themselves
in
anticipation
of
the
and
the
fireworks
which
would
inevitably
ensue
when
the
feldwebel
of
b
house
reported
with
a
rueful
countenance
that
according
to
his
reckoning
there
no
less
than
this
hope
was
however
frustrated
and
the
bubble
burst
two
hours
too
soon
the
two
last
men
in
the
tunnel
were
eventually
retrieved
and
emerged
from
the
plank
entrance
with
their
rescuers
to
find
the
door
at
the
entrance
open
the
had
duly
called
the
orderlies
some
twenty
minutes
previously
and
had
gone
away
suspecting
nothing
their
obvious
course
was
to
obey
instructions
and
go
back
to
their
house
by
the
same
way
as
they
had
come
but
for
some
reason
they
failed
to
do
so
and
ran
out
very
foolishly
into
the
cookhouse
in
the
enclosure
where
they
met
niemeyer
out
for
an
inopportune
early
morning
stroll
their
salvage
party
meanwhile
had
gone
back
by
the
proper
way
in
ten
minutes
the
whole
of
the
camp
staff
had
appeared
on
the
scene
the
two
officers
of
course
refused
to
say
anything
or
to
explain
their
muddy
condition
even
then
niemeyer
failed
to
tumble
to
what
had
actually
occurred
but
a
few
minutes
later
an
excited
farmer
appeared
at
the
postern
gate
and
led
the
whole
party
to
where
amid
the
trampled
rye
in
which
a
dozen
different
tracks
were
visible
from
the
camp
windows
a
gaping
hole
brought
recognition
and
late
wisdom
to
milwaukee
bill
ein
tunnel
the
same
dangerous
word
common
to
either
language
which
had
been
whispered
for
so
long
by
the
one
side
now
ran
like
electricity
through
the
ranks
of
the
other
the
next
question
from
point
of
view
was
how
many
the
fat
feldwebel
went
off
and
counted
an
expectant
house
he
found
everybody
unusually
wide
awake
and
good
humoured
for
that
hour
of
the
morning
the
fat
feldwebel
was
himself
thoroughly
amused
by
the
eventful
happenings
since
his
last
appearance
in
the
house
and
he
merely
chortled
as
name
after
name
elicited
no
response
he
returned
to
the
to
report
to
niemeyer
an
absentee
list
of
in
his
excitement
he
had
forgotten
to
count
the
room
from
which
all
three
occupants
had
flitted
then
came
the
real
moment
jaw
dropped
his
moustachios
for
a
brief
instant
lost
their
twirl
his
solid
stomach
swelled
less
impressively
against
his
overcoat
just
for
a
moment
he
became
grey
and
looked
very
old
but
only
for
a
moment
the
sound
of
laughter
in
the
upper
corridor
windows
floated
down
to
him
and
roused
action
and
the
devil
in
him
forthwith
as
an
initial
measure
he
put
all
the
windows
at
that
end
of
the
building
out
of
bounds
and
told
his
sentries
to
fire
at
once
if
a
face
appeared
then
he
had
the
outer
doors
of
both
houses
locked
then
he
placed
a
sentry
over
the
tunnel
head
and
stalked
away
to
the
kommandantur
to
ring
up
the
company
captain
in
holzminden
inform
the
police
report
events
to
corps
headquarters
at
hanover
and
issue
emergency
orders
the
safety
of
the
these
were
posted
up
in
both
houses
and
caused
considerable
amusement
briefly
they
permitted
the
officers
remaining
in
the
camp
to
eat
sleep
and
breathe
but
that
was
about
all
one
so
ran
the
order
inside
the
building
was
to
move
from
his
own
room
conversation
with
other
officers
in
the
corridors
or
by
the
notice
boards
was
forbidden
officers
were
not
allowed
to
stand
about
at
the
doors
of
the
buildings
no
officer
belonging
to
one
house
might
enter
the
other
officers
were
not
to
walk
about
in
groups
of
more
than
and
so
on
of
course
we
had
amply
expected
all
this
indeed
there
was
ground
for
congratulation
that
things
had
panned
out
up
to
the
present
without
murder
being
done
stringent
orders
had
been
issued
that
in
the
event
of
the
escape
only
being
discovered
at
the
there
was
to
be
no
laughter
or
demonstration
calculated
to
aggravate
months
before
the
more
had
discussed
the
prospects
of
someone
being
shot
in
the
first
wild
ebullition
of
fury
and
baffled
rage
at
the
defeat
of
all
his
precautions
it
was
one
advantage
of
the
premature
discovery
of
the
escape
that
what
shooting
was
ordered
was
confined
to
the
windows
the
magic
number
flitted
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
was
shouted
across
from
b
house
to
a
who
cheered
heartily
on
hearing
the
figure
it
was
indeed
a
good
number
and
constituted
an
easy
record
for
germany
if
not
for
all
time
und
long
ere
now
it
had
permeated
to
the
town
and
the
road
outside
the
camp
was
strangely
peopled
with
unusual
figures
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
anxious
to
view
the
scene
of
the
occurrence
and
most
of
them
no
doubt
vastly
pleased
at
the
discomfiture
of
the
notorious
bully
hauptmann
niemeyer
always
the
camp
had
been
the
diversion
of
a
sunday
evening
stroll
for
the
burghers
of
holzminden
now
we
played
daily
to
crowded
houses
until
the
commandant
in
his
exasperation
put
the
confines
of
the
camp
out
of
bounds
to
civilians
those
who
had
been
stuck
in
the
hours
of
the
dawn
exchanged
experiences
and
friendly
recrimination
personal
disappointment
was
merged
in
the
general
triumph
for
triumph
it
was
loose
in
germany
he
would
have
been
a
bold
man
who
would
have
breathed
that
number
in
hearing
the
sentries
grinned
as
they
echoed
it
kasten
the
fat
old
feldwebel
laughed
as
he
notched
it
on
the
next
and
niemeyer
tried
to
digest
it
he
was
not
very
successful
we
were
let
out
of
the
barracks
after
no
attempt
was
naturally
made
to
fall
in
with
the
newly
posted
camp
regulations
and
serious
collisions
with
niemeyer
as
soon
as
he
came
abroad
were
inevitable
there
was
at
the
bottom
of
mind
a
feeling
that
the
time
had
at
last
come
to
be
rid
of
him
that
now
the
star
of
the
great
twin
brethren
might
at
last
wane
and
the
wrath
from
hanover
or
berlin
descend
on
the
discredited
favourite
for
being
unable
either
to
keep
his
at
home
or
to
keep
order
in
his
own
house
but
bloodshed
was
to
be
avoided
it
was
a
difficult
policy
to
annoy
by
pinpricks
to
goad
an
already
maddened
creature
but
to
keep
as
a
community
within
the
law
but
it
was
the
right
policy
and
one
which
commended
itself
to
the
new
senior
british
officer
colonel
stokes
roberts
who
succeeded
to
the
position
vacated
by
colonel
rathborne
now
well
on
his
way
to
freedom
accordingly
the
red
rag
was
discreetly
held
out
and
niemeyer
retained
just
enough
not
to
draw
and
flourish
a
revolver
all
the
available
cells
were
filled
within
the
first
few
hours
with
candidates
for
three
arrest
their
crimes
were
imaginary
and
were
not
stated
they
might
have
failed
to
salute
at
paces
they
might
have
laughed
they
might
merely
have
happened
to
be
standing
somewhere
in
path
it
did
not
matter
they
had
certainly
all
broken
the
latest
camp
regulations
all
the
orderlies
were
taken
off
duty
and
set
to
dig
up
the
tunnel
the
tin
rooms
and
parcel
rooms
were
closed
until
further
notice
i
myself
whose
complicity
with
the
plot
was
highly
suspected
was
removed
from
my
own
room
and
bundled
unceremoniously
into
one
of
the
large
rooms
on
the
top
floor
of
a
house
the
windows
of
the
cells
were
barricaded
up
and
made
quite
dark
by
day
and
the
lights
in
them
were
kept
on
all
night
every
german
in
the
camp
personnel
was
put
on
to
sentry
duty
and
sentries
paraded
the
passages
three
times
in
the
night
the
use
of
the
bath
room
attendant
for
this
purpose
precluded
baths
in
a
word
we
were
and
the
camp
knew
once
more
the
open
warfare
which
had
prevailed
for
the
first
unforgettable
month
of
its
existence
illustration
orderlies
digging
out
the
tunnel
between
kaserne
b
and
the
outer
the
inconveniences
of
such
a
state
of
affairs
were
lightly
borne
and
even
relished
by
the
large
majority
the
tunnellers
had
scored
too
heavily
for
us
to
mind
doing
scapegoat
for
them
it
was
a
pleasant
thought
that
all
were
still
abroad
and
that
there
was
a
reasonable
certainty
of
a
fair
proportion
of
them
getting
over
and
putting
a
stop
to
run
of
atrocious
good
luck
in
the
matter
of
escapes
apart
from
the
hue
and
cry
which
had
already
been
raised
through
the
north
german
press
the
fugitives
had
everything
in
their
favour
they
had
had
months
to
deliberate
on
their
route
and
travelling
tactics
their
packs
had
been
stocked
at
leisure
so
as
to
combine
the
maximum
of
nutrition
with
the
minimum
of
weight
their
civilian
disguises
were
adequate
for
their
purpose
most
of
them
were
going
to
trust
to
their
legs
to
carry
them
over
the
border
and
would
be
only
night
birds
of
passage
lying
up
during
the
day
but
colonel
rathborne
possessed
a
knowledge
of
german
and
a
superb
civilian
suit
over
which
he
had
put
pyjamas
in
going
through
the
tunnel
and
which
would
be
able
to
set
casual
interference
blandly
at
defiance
he
was
walking
due
south
to
göttingen
and
was
there
going
to
entrain
for
aachen
cassel
and
frankfurt
if
all
went
well
with
him
and
his
forged
passport
passed
muster
he
would
be
over
the
frontier
in
under
three
days
and
later
when
six
days
had
gone
by
and
he
had
not
returned
the
camp
knew
that
the
spell
had
been
broken
and
that
an
englishman
was
over
from
holzminden
but
we
said
nothing
to
the
germans
however
before
six
days
had
passed
a
good
number
of
the
had
already
been
rounded
up
and
brought
back
to
camp
as
they
were
kept
in
the
strictest
isolation
it
was
only
possible
to
hear
their
stories
by
bribing
the
cell
attendants
to
bring
written
messages
from
them
if
bribes
failed
the
message
was
concealed
somehow
in
their
trays
of
food
every
officer
in
detention
cell
had
to
have
a
friend
to
feed
cook
his
food
and
see
that
it
was
delivered
to
him
otherwise
he
existed
in
on
the
german
ration
it
was
the
usual
thing
preparatory
to
an
attempt
to
escape
to
arrange
for
your
feeding
arrangements
in
and
the
penalty
of
recapture
was
shared
to
the
full
by
the
luckless
partner
who
thus
had
double
work
sharp
and
luscombe
were
the
first
pair
back
as
they
had
been
the
last
pair
away
they
had
had
two
days
and
a
night
out
and
had
been
caught
passing
through
a
village
at
night
about
miles
down
the
weser
sharp
reported
that
at
his
search
on
being
brought
back
to
the
camp
niemeyer
had
vented
his
spleen
on
him
by
picking
a
valuable
gold
watch
to
pieces
with
his
pocket
knife
and
by
giving
instructions
for
his
civilian
clothes
which
included
a
brand
new
coat
from
england
to
be
ripped
to
ribbons
every
day
brought
in
some
fresh
recapture
and
the
cell
accommodation
being
completely
inadequate
to
cope
with
the
numerous
criminals
the
town
gaol
was
drawn
upon
to
afford
relief
it
was
a
sad
blow
to
the
camp
when
some
of
the
foremost
spirits
in
the
lawrence
butler
and
brought
back
after
being
out
about
ten
days
butler
had
stolen
a
bicycle
and
was
caught
on
it
while
passing
through
a
village
the
others
had
been
taken
in
the
vicinity
of
the
ems
all
these
separate
captures
used
to
be
described
at
length
and
with
appropriate
embellishments
in
the
hanoverian
press
thus
in
one
organ
it
was
stated
that
the
refugees
were
all
wearing
british
uniform
another
had
it
that
british
naval
uniform
was
the
mode
with
the
buttons
altered
yet
another
explained
that
the
prisoners
had
escaped
in
civilian
disguise
procured
from
british
friends
outside
the
camp
to
be
sure
we
had
british
friends
outside
the
did
not
but
one
could
imagine
the
burghers
of
hanover
reading
this
sort
of
stuff
and
commenting
on
the
lax
policy
of
the
government
towards
enemy
aliens
a
detective
from
berlin
had
arrived
shortly
after
the
escape
and
displayed
the
usual
aptitude
of
his
species
in
examining
the
tunnel
several
hours
elapsed
before
he
found
the
door
in
the
partition
this
was
all
in
favour
since
a
mere
commandant
a
layman
in
the
science
of
crime
could
not
reasonably
have
been
expected
to
guess
the
secret
which
had
temporarily
baffled
the
expert
such
acuteness
would
have
been
unseemly
and
unprofessional
the
detective
took
a
large
number
of
photographs
and
made
a
large
number
of
notes
and
the
two
parted
on
the
best
of
terms
when
niemeyer
had
bowed
the
important
visitor
off
the
premises
he
turned
his
attention
once
more
to
the
safe
keeping
of
the
british
officers
still
remaining
under
his
wing
footnote
three
of
these
are
reproduced
in
this
book
for
several
days
he
achieved
a
crescendo
of
fury
and
malevolence
and
maintained
all
the
outward
characteristics
of
a
mad
bull
unfortunately
he
had
not
in
any
way
fallen
from
grace
a
staff
officer
from
hanover
specially
sent
down
to
examine
the
affair
was
to
our
disappointment
an
apparently
appreciative
witness
of
his
behaviour
we
had
calculated
that
von
hänisch
would
by
now
have
discovered
a
flaw
in
his
chosen
instrument
and
that
the
attitude
of
the
chief
might
be
seen
to
be
reflected
in
his
subordinates
but
we
were
out
of
our
reckoning
the
captain
from
hanover
used
even
to
accompany
niemeyer
in
his
periodical
incursions
into
the
camp
precincts
and
stand
stolidly
by
while
the
latter
blackguarded
every
englishman
within
reach
or
hearing
possibly
niemeyer
had
got
ideas
from
reading
don
quixote
on
his
dull
evenings
one
of
his
favourite
amusements
during
this
period
was
to
make
fierce
onslaughts
with
his
stick
on
the
washing
hanging
out
to
dry
on
the
wire
fence
between
the
two
main
buildings
he
would
lunge
at
some
unoffending
spit
it
brandish
it
violently
in
the
air
and
then
trample
on
it
it
was
against
the
regulations
for
washing
to
be
hung
on
the
wire
and
the
commandant
sacrificed
his
personal
dignity
to
see
that
these
regulations
were
unflinchingly
obeyed
his
behaviour
towards
the
orderlies
was
a
delightful
contrast
usually
domineering
and
towards
them
beyond
the
ordinary
he
was
now
good
fellowship
itself
the
orderlies
were
all
employed
digging
up
the
tunnel
and
niemeyer
used
to
stand
by
them
for
hours
at
a
time
asking
the
men
questions
about
their
homes
in
england
their
wives
and
children
and
generally
trying
to
put
himself
on
the
best
possible
terms
with
them
niemeyer
was
looking
desperately
hard
for
a
scapegoat
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
no
one
had
been
caught
actually
the
tunnel
and
every
officer
recaptured
stoutly
refused
to
say
how
he
had
got
out
there
was
no
tangible
evidence
of
any
conspiracy
consequently
unless
an
admission
of
complicity
was
wrung
from
one
of
the
orderlies
the
charge
of
doing
damage
to
german
property
levelled
against
a
number
of
unconvicted
and
unconvictable
persons
would
lose
weight
however
circumstantial
the
evidence
and
it
was
punishment
to
the
hilt
which
the
commandant
in
his
wounded
pride
yearned
after
but
his
clumsy
overtures
took
in
nobody
the
men
knew
that
he
was
trying
his
hardest
to
pump
them
and
gave
nothing
away
chapter
x
closing
incidents
niemeyer
had
often
in
more
peaceful
days
jocularly
remarked
that
the
conduct
of
the
british
officers
was
making
him
an
old
man
before
his
time
such
of
us
as
in
these
days
were
brought
face
to
face
with
him
began
to
get
a
comfortable
feeling
that
this
indeed
was
the
case
he
was
reported
to
be
and
by
this
time
he
was
looking
every
day
of
it
the
actual
on
which
the
senior
british
officer
decided
to
force
the
issue
was
the
treatment
on
the
day
after
the
escape
of
an
officer
called
phelan
this
officer
had
on
his
way
down
to
the
cells
been
brutally
kicked
by
a
sentry
under
the
approving
eye
of
a
particularly
odious
feldwebel
of
the
best
prussian
pattern
surnamed
klausen
and
known
familiarly
as
the
act
had
been
witnessed
by
at
least
six
british
officers
and
the
evidence
duly
taken
down
the
senior
british
officer
therefore
gave
the
phelan
incident
pride
of
place
in
a
summary
sent
to
niemeyer
of
various
individual
and
collective
injustices
visited
on
the
members
of
the
camp
since
the
discovery
of
the
tunnel
and
added
a
curt
ultimatum
that
unless
these
grievances
were
promptly
redressed
he
would
be
unable
to
be
responsible
for
the
further
conduct
of
the
british
officers
this
was
an
extreme
step
and
had
never
even
in
this
turbulent
camp
been
employed
before
for
the
senior
british
officer
to
disclaim
authority
over
his
own
implied
legally
speaking
that
he
regarded
the
conditions
of
imprisonment
as
too
monstrous
to
be
covered
by
the
accepted
rules
of
the
hague
convention
and
that
in
fact
he
looked
upon
the
commandant
not
as
his
sentinel
in
an
honourable
captivity
under
the
rules
of
war
but
as
his
gaoler
in
a
common
gaol
where
international
conventions
did
not
apply
once
this
attitude
was
taken
up
the
ordinary
courtesies
of
military
etiquette
would
have
to
be
abandoned
salutes
not
offered
passive
resistance
everywhere
adopted
uniformity
of
conduct
would
be
an
absolute
essential
and
elaborate
precautions
were
taken
to
warn
the
camp
by
word
of
would
have
been
too
what
procedure
was
to
be
followed
if
the
order
went
forth
that
diplomatic
relations
had
been
broken
off
with
the
huns
the
position
in
those
stormy
days
was
an
onerous
one
it
was
the
essence
of
the
whole
british
policy
that
the
senior
orders
should
be
carried
out
to
the
letter
due
allowance
had
also
to
be
made
for
the
incalculable
perversity
of
the
per
to
whom
reference
has
already
been
made
both
of
these
duties
fell
to
the
adjutant
of
the
camp
working
through
the
adjutants
of
the
houses
written
instructions
were
impossible
on
account
of
the
risk
it
was
necessary
to
warn
personally
every
one
of
the
odd
officers
in
the
camp
and
to
explain
when
and
if
necessary
why
action
was
to
be
taken
in
accordance
with
of
resistance
a
or
no
reply
was
received
to
the
ultimatum
and
it
was
decided
therefore
to
put
into
execution
a
general
scheme
of
passive
resistance
on
the
morning
after
the
expiry
of
the
ultimatum
the
entire
camp
shuffled
late
and
listlessly
on
to
wearing
for
the
most
part
cardigan
jackets
instead
of
tunics
and
innocent
of
all
headgear
when
the
german
officers
appeared
no
one
saluted
or
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
them
ulrich
hesitated
grasped
the
situation
and
went
straight
back
to
the
kommandantur
to
report
he
returned
with
a
message
from
the
commandant
to
the
senior
british
officer
that
if
he
could
arrange
for
an
orderly
in
an
time
he
the
commandant
would
be
glad
to
discuss
matters
and
examine
the
list
of
grievances
submitted
so
far
so
good
the
word
was
circulated
for
a
perfect
at
but
at
after
the
conclusion
of
an
which
for
correctness
of
dress
and
demeanour
would
have
satisfied
the
soul
even
of
the
late
lamented
lincke
niemeyer
strode
on
to
the
middle
of
the
parade
ground
and
disillusioned
us
yentlemen
he
bawled
out
have
broken
the
camp
regulations
so
you
must
be
punished
there
will
be
no
sport
for
three
the
camp
was
too
flabbergasted
even
to
boo
or
groan
we
had
trusted
him
and
paid
the
obvious
penalty
the
whole
incident
was
typically
prussian
colonel
stokes
roberts
did
the
only
possible
thing
under
the
circumstances
and
countered
with
an
order
for
another
passive
resistance
at
once
again
tunics
and
caps
were
discarded
and
the
long
rows
of
ragamuffins
stood
listlessly
awaiting
the
pleasure
of
their
gaolers
to
come
and
count
them
there
was
likely
to
be
trouble
this
time
for
the
authorities
would
be
forewarned
and
it
was
noticed
that
the
guard
were
standing
paraded
in
front
of
the
kommandantur
it
was
just
a
question
of
how
far
our
friend
would
dare
to
go
the
action
of
the
british
was
seen
from
the
kommandantur
and
the
german
officers
did
not
even
come
on
an
interpreter
was
sent
out
to
order
all
officers
to
go
back
to
their
houses
as
we
trailed
off
the
parade
ground
niemeyer
appeared
at
the
head
of
about
a
dozen
sentries
with
bayonets
fixed
and
roared
to
us
to
get
into
our
houses
as
there
was
only
one
door
in
each
house
this
was
an
impossible
feat
and
the
disreputable
crowd
merely
grinned
at
the
sheepish
sentries
and
the
commandant
fulminating
from
one
barrack
to
another
the
british
acted
creditably
up
to
their
allotted
part
of
brainless
dejected
criminals
and
there
was
no
demonstration
or
provocative
action
as
we
gradually
melted
away
into
our
respective
barracks
one
officer
however
who
had
on
board
rather
more
than
was
good
for
him
did
his
best
to
promote
bloodshed
he
dropped
a
large
faggot
from
an
upper
window
in
b
kaserne
which
missed
niemeyer
by
inches
beside
himself
with
rage
the
commandant
ordered
the
nearest
sentry
to
fire
indicating
the
only
officer
then
within
sight
a
lame
flying
officer
as
the
target
the
man
who
was
really
not
to
be
blamed
fired
up
the
staircase
up
which
the
officer
was
making
all
haste
to
retreat
missed
him
by
a
few
inches
and
splintered
a
window
then
the
doors
were
closed
and
we
breathed
again
the
of
mutiny
was
brought
by
niemeyer
when
in
company
with
the
hanover
staff
captain
he
interviewed
colonel
stokes
roberts
that
evening
the
camp
had
publicly
mutinied
and
the
mutiny
would
have
to
be
made
the
subject
of
a
special
report
the
senior
british
officer
desired
nothing
better
a
special
report
he
suggested
might
eventually
result
in
bringing
facts
to
light
he
begged
the
permission
to
forward
two
letters
to
the
dutch
legation
at
berlin
and
to
the
which
contained
accusations
of
misconduct
against
the
commandant
by
german
law
niemeyer
was
bound
to
forward
these
letters
however
much
he
disliked
their
matter
it
did
not
however
at
all
follow
that
he
would
do
so
and
accordingly
to
prevent
any
possibility
of
miscarriage
duplicate
letters
were
smuggled
out
of
the
camp
into
the
safe
keeping
of
the
typist
with
injunctions
to
deliver
the
goods
the
letter
to
the
asked
urgently
for
an
inspection
of
the
camp
by
a
responsible
superior
officer
so
far
the
campaign
had
proceeded
satisfactorily
the
case
sooner
or
later
would
be
put
against
niemeyer
without
delicacy
or
reserve
before
the
supreme
german
military
authority
then
the
whole
history
of
the
camp
could
be
bluntly
narrated
the
damning
black
book
hauled
up
from
its
in
room
of
b
house
and
presented
for
inspection
and
comment
the
cards
were
in
our
hands
now
if
we
had
the
opportunity
of
playing
them
only
the
tribunal
must
be
reasonably
impartial
and
niemeyer
must
not
be
suffered
to
interpret
too
many
a
good
chance
had
gone
begging
ere
this
in
the
history
simply
because
the
commandant
in
conducting
an
interview
had
systematically
interpreted
black
as
white
and
adroitly
diverted
the
discussion
from
the
subject
of
himself
it
had
been
an
unfortunate
coincidence
that
whenever
a
representative
from
the
in
berlin
had
visited
the
camp
either
he
had
been
unable
to
speak
english
or
the
senior
british
officer
of
the
time
had
been
unable
to
speak
german
the
commandant
with
his
fluent
knowledge
of
english
had
invariably
provided
the
convenient
bridge
and
the
interview
had
accordingly
failed
miserably
in
its
object
until
the
visit
from
the
conditions
remained
much
as
before
except
that
we
gave
orderly
our
policy
was
to
lie
low
and
await
whatever
daniel
the
should
deign
to
send
us
niemeyer
seemed
determined
to
make
what
hay
he
could
while
the
sun
shone
his
way
of
doing
so
took
the
form
of
gross
personal
discourtesy
to
the
senior
british
officer
on
the
day
after
the
letters
to
the
dutch
legation
and
german
war
office
had
been
handed
in
he
stalked
on
to
went
up
to
colonel
stokes
roberts
and
asked
him
in
a
menacing
tone
if
he
took
full
responsibility
for
all
that
had
been
written
in
them
on
an
answer
being
given
in
the
affirmative
he
became
violently
abusive
and
ordered
the
colonel
to
produce
another
speaker
in
his
stead
as
he
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
he
then
proceeded
publicly
to
insult
colonel
stokes
roberts
in
a
manner
absolutely
unprecedented
colonel
roberts
after
the
first
salute
had
been
standing
as
was
customary
at
ease
in
the
orthodox
manner
niemeyer
suddenly
bellowed
to
him
to
stand
at
attention
guess
speak
to
me
at
attention
put
your
heels
it
was
the
very
last
straw
and
made
cheeks
flame
and
ears
tingle
in
the
agony
of
furious
humiliation
niemeyer
persisted
in
his
demand
for
another
to
represent
the
camp
only
giving
away
his
lamentable
ignorance
of
our
military
customs
in
even
formulating
the
request
as
a
joke
the
names
of
some
of
his
most
avowed
and
outspoken
enemies
were
submitted
for
his
approval
prominent
on
this
list
was
the
name
of
lieutenant
beyfus
a
barrister
of
repute
a
prisoner
of
three
standing
and
on
frequent
occasions
an
able
exponent
to
niemeyer
on
the
rights
of
the
individual
in
captivity
niemeyer
whose
sense
of
humour
failed
him
in
these
days
furiously
repudiated
such
a
preposterous
nomination
no
he
fumed
will
not
have
ze
beyfus
get
me
we
were
paying
for
the
tunnel
but
every
day
that
passed
now
without
someone
being
brought
back
increased
our
hopes
that
it
had
not
been
dug
in
vain
colonel
rathborne
was
by
now
certainly
over
gray
bousfield
three
others
of
the
and
four
not
of
the
were
still
abroad
and
it
was
a
fortnight
since
the
night
of
the
escape
further
the
opening
of
the
big
allied
offensive
on
august
put
new
heart
into
us
the
first
advance
showed
a
great
slice
on
our
maps
that
looked
indeed
like
the
moving
warfare
for
which
we
had
in
our
own
day
so
often
made
preparation
in
vain
also
we
heard
on
reliable
authority
that
a
bavarian
regiment
moving
from
the
bulgarian
to
the
western
front
had
mutinied
at
some
place
quite
near
and
such
of
the
more
left
of
the
german
papers
as
we
were
permitted
to
read
were
full
of
their
proposed
campaign
for
the
autumn
session
of
the
reichstag
it
was
a
more
healthy
atmosphere
altogether
than
in
the
terrible
days
of
march
only
four
and
a
half
months
ago
any
suspected
officers
in
either
kaserne
received
short
shrift
in
these
days
and
were
bundled
unceremoniously
from
their
rooms
into
safer
quarters
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
kaserne
where
the
lower
windows
were
never
open
and
the
flies
and
staleness
of
the
atmosphere
were
correspondingly
oppressive
billets
in
this
way
were
found
for
any
officers
who
had
been
known
to
have
escaped
before
and
who
were
referred
to
feelingly
by
niemeyer
as
these
particular
rooms
used
to
be
visited
two
or
three
times
in
a
night
by
a
feldwebel
with
an
electric
torch
which
he
used
to
flash
on
the
occupant
of
each
bed
in
turn
thereby
effectually
waking
everybody
up
here
lay
the
and
eloquent
beyfus
whose
recent
arrival
had
prevented
his
obtaining
a
place
in
the
tunnel
scheme
but
whose
record
made
him
a
marked
man
with
the
authorities
here
i
myself
lay
after
yet
another
enforced
migration
from
the
attic
floor
in
a
house
and
in
lied
the
official
orders
from
hanover
and
here
also
lay
leefe
robinson
whose
gallant
spirit
niemeyer
with
subtle
cruelty
had
endeavoured
for
months
past
to
break
that
untimely
death
on
his
return
from
captivity
was
assisted
indirectly
by
the
treatment
which
he
received
at
the
hands
of
niemeyer
no
one
will
deny
who
was
in
a
position
to
witness
that
treatment
the
handling
to
which
leefe
robinson
was
subjected
was
so
outrageous
that
it
was
communicated
to
the
home
authorities
in
a
concealed
report
in
the
hollow
of
a
tennis
racket
handle
an
exchange
party
robinson
had
come
from
freiburg
in
baden
where
he
had
made
an
attempt
with
several
others
to
escape
english
niemeyer
with
coarse
urbanity
called
him
to
his
at
once
singled
out
as
the
victim
of
a
malevolent
scheme
of
repression
he
was
placed
in
the
most
uncomfortable
room
in
the
camp
whereas
his
rank
entitled
him
to
the
privileges
of
a
small
room
he
was
caused
to
answer
to
a
special
two
or
three
times
in
a
day
and
he
was
forbidden
under
any
pretext
to
enter
kaserne
b
on
the
occasion
of
a
visit
from
some
inspecting
general
and
on
the
pretext
of
all
the
rooms
having
to
be
cleaned
up
and
ready
for
inspection
by
room
was
entered
by
a
feldwebel
and
sentries
at
and
robinson
himself
was
forcibly
pulled
out
of
bed
and
the
table
next
to
the
bed
upset
on
the
floor
two
hours
later
niemeyer
was
introducing
english
to
the
august
visitor
with
a
profusion
of
oleaginous
compliments
and
four
hours
later
robinson
was
in
the
cells
for
having
disobeyed
camp
orders
truly
most
damnable
and
cowardly
persecution
notwithstanding
all
this
the
chamber
of
horrors
as
the
room
devoted
to
the
criminals
used
popularly
to
be
known
was
the
scene
of
many
a
humorous
incident
restricted
space
caused
the
bed
of
the
eloquent
beyfus
to
be
very
near
the
door
on
the
flooring
just
inside
the
door
lay
the
mat
upon
which
beyfus
used
to
stand
to
undress
whenever
the
germans
came
into
the
room
beyfus
always
contrived
that
the
door
should
impinge
upon
some
part
of
his
person
and
seized
the
occasion
to
call
every
german
within
commandant
of
course
for
witness
the
unprovoked
attack
upon
his
blushing
modesty
great
effect
was
added
when
the
harangue
was
delivered
in
the
passage
and
only
in
shirt
and
slippers
the
spanish
which
descended
in
those
days
in
an
all
embracing
form
on
the
camp
brought
some
compensating
humour
in
the
first
place
niemeyer
got
it
at
once
and
was
reported
quite
incorrectly
to
be
dying
the
wish
both
amongst
germans
and
british
was
doubtless
father
to
this
rumour
then
all
the
orderlies
got
it
at
the
same
time
and
the
officers
swept
and
garnished
for
themselves
and
finally
when
the
disease
had
filtered
through
from
the
orderlies
and
taken
fair
hold
of
the
officers
every
room
in
both
barracks
was
filled
with
the
groans
of
those
who
thought
they
were
about
to
die
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
more
than
a
dozen
were
at
all
seriously
ill
and
these
recovered
quite
rapidly
the
long
expected
visit
from
the
representative
synchronised
with
the
tail
end
of
the
outbreak
and
came
at
precisely
the
wrong
moment
in
the
first
place
i
was
sick
it
should
have
been
my
business
to
warn
the
senior
british
officer
of
the
visit
and
arrange
for
an
english
officer
to
interpret
his
remarks
at
the
interview
unfortunately
and
through
fault
nothing
of
this
sort
was
done
colonel
stokes
roberts
was
sent
for
at
a
notice
and
had
his
hand
forced
niemeyer
once
again
acted
as
interpreter
the
blinkers
were
kept
on
throughout
and
the
visitor
went
away
satisfied
that
the
complaints
made
by
the
british
had
been
grossly
exaggerated
that
niemeyer
in
spite
of
his
reputation
was
after
all
a
very
pleasant
fellow
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
report
on
unfavourably
in
the
conduct
of
the
camp
thus
the
rebellion
at
holzminden
petered
unsatisfactorily
out
it
had
been
no
fault
that
the
chance
had
come
and
gone
untaken
but
it
was
evident
that
it
would
not
come
again
and
that
the
last
final
effort
to
remove
niemeyer
had
been
as
fruitless
as
the
first
on
the
other
side
the
charge
of
general
mutiny
was
not
pressed
and
legal
proceedings
were
reserved
only
for
those
implicated
in
the
tunnel
gradually
the
sombre
camp
resumed
its
normal
working
a
new
adjutant
succeeded
to
office
and
i
together
with
other
suspected
criminals
was
transported
to
a
camp
of
more
fancied
security
under
the
new
adjutant
some
form
of
in
the
general
interests
with
the
german
authorities
became
once
more
possible
his
predecessor
bundled
out
of
the
camp
with
two
other
officers
at
two
notice
had
the
pleasure
before
leaving
of
firing
one
parthian
shot
at
the
commandant
the
evening
before
an
unsigned
postcard
had
been
received
from
the
hague
it
ran
old
bean
and
was
addressed
to
colonel
late
we
communicated
the
substance
of
this
postcard
to
niemeyer
and
it
was
some
consolation
before
we
shook
the
dust
of
holzminden
off
our
feet
for
ever
to
see
the
confession
of
defeat
written
plainly
in
his
face
once
for
the
first
time
since
the
original
discovery
of
the
fairly
failed
him
events
however
were
moving
too
rapidly
now
for
it
to
be
a
matter
of
great
consequence
to
niemeyer
even
that
he
should
have
let
a
slip
through
his
fingers
his
own
hour
was
near
to
striking
as
the
british
advance
in
september
continued
without
respite
and
the
inevitable
end
came
ever
nearer
so
this
disreputable
old
man
changed
his
tactics
accordingly
he
very
rarely
came
within
the
precincts
of
the
camp
but
he
saw
the
adjutant
almost
daily
and
at
every
interview
some
concession
or
other
long
striven
for
was
now
readily
given
he
even
began
to
prepare
the
ground
for
a
in
his
prussian
creed
and
politics
the
picture
of
the
kaiser
vanished
from
the
wall
of
his
sanctum
he
became
the
strangest
and
most
undignified
contrast
to
the
swaggering
bully
who
had
ruled
this
roost
so
long
and
finally
when
on
the
conclusion
of
hostilities
the
und
soldaten
took
over
the
military
direction
of
affairs
in
the
town
he
was
suffered
to
disappear
unmolested
and
cover
his
tracks
as
best
he
might
it
is
not
known
what
has
happened
to
him
by
some
he
is
stated
to
be
in
arrest
at
hanover
by
others
to
have
removed
himself
and
his
gains
to
a
neutral
country
it
is
quite
probable
that
we
shall
never
hear
of
him
again
for
he
had
no
murders
to
his
charge
and
may
not
be
included
by
the
supreme
council
in
the
punishable
class
but
it
is
certain
that
he
will
never
again
walk
up
bond
street
or
show
his
face
in
milwaukee
he
must
rest
on
his
laurels
and
be
content
with
his
european
reputation
footnote
both
the
niemeyers
were
on
the
black
list
to
give
some
idea
of
the
actual
difficulties
of
the
final
exit
and
escape
it
may
be
well
to
include
the
following
graphic
account
from
the
first
man
through
kits
of
the
first
working
party
were
got
down
in
the
daytime
i
had
been
chosen
to
cut
out
and
as
soon
as
the
ten
was
over
in
the
rooms
and
i
we
were
going
to
together
went
off
through
the
swing
doors
the
hole
into
the
eaves
the
quarters
and
so
into
the
tunnel
left
my
room
at
about
and
in
ten
minutes
i
was
worming
my
way
along
the
hole
for
the
last
time
noting
all
the
old
familiar
ups
and
downs
and
bends
bumping
my
head
against
the
same
old
stones
and
feeling
the
weight
of
responsibility
rather
much
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
did
a
bit
of
praying
on
the
way
along
when
i
got
to
the
end
into
the
small
pit
which
we
had
dug
to
drop
the
earth
of
the
roof
into
i
put
my
kit
on
one
side
and
got
to
work
with
a
large
bread
knife
it
was
of
course
pitch
dark
i
was
kneeling
in
the
pit
digging
vertically
up
the
earth
fell
into
my
hair
eyes
and
ears
and
down
my
neck
i
notice
it
much
then
but
found
afterwards
that
my
shirt
and
vest
were
completely
brown
by
about
i
had
a
hole
through
to
the
air
about
inches
in
diameter
it
was
raining
but
the
arc
lamps
made
it
look
very
light
outside
i
found
to
my
delight
that
we
had
estimated
right
and
that
i
had
come
up
just
beyond
a
row
of
beans
which
would
thus
hide
my
exit
with
any
luck
from
the
sentry
by
the
way
was
open
and
i
pushed
my
kit
through
and
crawled
out
the
sentry
nearest
us
had
a
cough
which
enabled
me
to
locate
him
but
as
he
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
and
not
in
the
light
of
the
electric
lamps
i
could
not
see
him
this
made
it
a
bit
more
uncomfortable
as
i
know
but
that
he
was
staring
straight
at
me
i
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
and
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
just
at
that
moment
the
rain
stopped
a
bright
full
moon
shone
out
and
an
absolute
stillness
reigned
the
rye
was
very
ripe
and
crackled
badly
and
so
after
a
whispered
consultation
with
i
decided
to
crawl
in
a
southerly
direction
down
the
edge
of
the
keeping
under
cover
of
the
gardens
there
had
only
been
the
three
of
us
to
escape
we
could
have
barged
straight
through
the
rye
but
we
had
to
think
of
the
hordes
behind
us
and
could
not
afford
to
take
risks
reached
the
end
of
the
cover
afforded
by
the
gardens
and
were
debating
what
to
do
when
luckily
the
rain
started
again
and
we
crawled
through
the
rye
the
noise
of
the
rain
pattering
on
the
rye
being
sufficient
to
drown
that
made
by
our
progress
through
the
rye
we
stopped
to
put
on
our
rücksacks
and
then
made
for
the
river
weser
which
we
had
to
cross
close
to
the
river
bank
we
found
four
or
five
large
hurdles
piling
these
one
on
top
of
the
other
we
made
a
raft
on
which
we
ferried
across
first
our
kits
and
then
our
clothes
the
water
was
warm
but
the
wind
cold
we
dressed
and
started
again
it
was
by
this
time
about
thought
he
heard
a
shot
and
we
were
afraid
that
the
boche
had
spotted
someone
getting
out
we
rounded
the
spur
of
a
hill
and
the
lights
of
the
which
looked
so
pretty
from
outside
were
shut
from
our
view
we
said
to
holzminden
which
unhappily
turned
out
for
us

be
only

on

of

from

a
narrow
strip
of
water
over
which
a

plies
to
and

on
the
further
side

them

a

odd
hungry
british
officers
the
unwilling
guests
of
his
then
imperial
majesty
wilhelm
ii
they
were
a
not
inconsiderable
part
of
the
many
taken
in
the
three
gigantic
german
offensives
between
march
and
may
they
came
in
big
batches
from
the
camps
of
rastatt
and
former
place
a
memory
that
will
endure
for
their
lives
with
those
who
were
in
little
driblets
from
the
hospitals
whence
they
had
been
discharged
hither
came
also
in
september
officers
from
aachen
the
last
of
their
illusions
gone
they
had
been
sent
from
various
camps
to
that
place
the
for
internment
and
happier
things
they
had
stayed
there
two
months
their
parcels
which
should
have
been
forwarded
to
them
went
persistently
in
many
cases
even
their
luggage
had
gone
to
holland
they
had
been
taken
for
walks
and
had
viewed
the
promised
land
and
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
the
congestion
of
sick
at
aachen
had
necessitated
their
removal
and
they
had
been
to
the
wait
and
wait
and
begin
the
dreary
round
again
they
moved
our
sympathy
they
had
had
two
and
a
half
years
of
it
and
now
they
had
as
little
to
eat
as
and
not
much
more
to
wear
than
the
new
arrivals
but
one
of
them
had
a
typewriter
and
hither
came
also
a
little
party
of
three
from
holzminden
camp
in
brunswick
transferred
as
i
have
previously
explained
as
suspected
persons
to
a
camp
of
really
reliable
security
major
gilbert
lieutenant
ortweiler
and
myself
had
been
told
one
morning
that
we
had
an
hour
and
a
half
in
which
to
pack
we
packed
and
went
stralsund
was
like
a
rest
cure
it
is
indeed
a
pleasant
spot
a
channel
narrow
at
the
entrances
broadening
to
ninety
yards
in
the
middle
divides
the
islands
standing
on
the
bridge
which
spans
the
channel

its
narrowest
one
looks

with
the
setting

behind
it
or
with
the
morning
sun
full
on
it
it
is
beautiful
venice
viewed
from
the

could
hardly
be
prettier
the
dome
of
the
marianne
kirche
dominates
the
town
and
the
sails
of
the
fishing
vessels
could
be
just
seen
with
an
occasional
moving
in
the
blue
sound
in
greater
danholm
the
chestnuts
are
magnificent
there
is
one
avenue
of
trees
which
meet
each
other
overhead
as
in
a
cathedral
nave
and
there
was
one
little
segregated
spot
which
for
no
particular
reason
we
called
king
henry
name
seemed
to
suit
one
could
take
half
an
hour
walking
round
the
camp
but
it
is
not
my
intention
by
painting
too
glowing
a
picture
to
alienate
my
sympathy
the
place
was
good
but
german
the
buildings
were
good
but
had
held
russians
the
air
was
good
but
there
were
smells
we
had
been
we
considered
ourselves
in
this
horde
of
and
it
would
be
cold
very
cold
in
winter
we
had
a
holiday
revelling
in
the
unexpected
beauty
the
much
less
uncomfortable
beds
with
their
extra
sheet
the
sea
bath
in
the
mornings
the
freedom
and
scope
of
movement
the
almost
latent
wire
the
inoffensiveness
of
the
german
personnel
the
unobtrusiveness
of
the
commandant
the
beer
liquorice
but
still
beer
of
a
sort
the
exchange
of
news
with
the
new
prisoners
and
the
picking
up
of
old
threads
the
sight
of
the
sea
from
our
landing
window
the
games
on
real
grass
and
then
in
quite
a
different
sense
we
began
looking
round
we
learned
that
the
authorities
were
quietly
and
politely
confident
that
the
place
was
they
expected
attempts
oh
yes
know
it
is
your
duty
we
should
do
it
and
conventionalities
of
the
sort
that
are
common
when
german
officers
of
a
decent
there
were
such
on
this
themselves
in
conversation
with
englishmen
it
can
not
be
one
has
ever
escaped
from
here
true
it
might
be
easy
to
cut
the
wire
and
get
on
to
the
main
part
of
the
island
but
we
have
our
dogs
if
you
swim
to
the
mainland
you
will
be
recognised
and
brought
back
even
if
you
get
across
to
rügen
you
have
to
get
off
it
and
you
would
be
missed
we
have
our
seaplane
to
scour
the
sea
the
ferry
is
guarded
and
so
on
subsequent
events
appeared
to
justify
this
view
attempts
were
made
and
failed
in
quick
succession
in
each
case
the
objective
was
the
same
though
aimed
at
by
different
open
sea
and
the
danish
island
of
bornholm
or
danish
territory
elsewhere
two
officers
yachtsmen
born
cut
the
wire
one
night
swam
out
towards
rügen
boarded
an
empty
fishing
vessel
about
yards
out
and
got
clean
away
they
stranded
off
the
corner
of
rügen
and
were
recaptured
three
others
commandeered
a
boat
which
had
been
left
unpadlocked
in
the
channel
rowed
to
the
mainland
and
separated
two
were
recaptured
immediately
the
third
was
at
large
some
days
and
was
eventually
arrested
some
way
down
the
coast
i
did
not
learn
his
story
another
party
of
three
attempted
to
paddle
over
to
rügen
on
a
cattle
trough
they
selected
a
stormy
night
were
upset
fifty
yards
out
of
the
channel
and
got
back
unobserved
with
difficulty
and
as
one
of
them
could
not
swim
rather
luckily
so
far
as
the
german
precautions
went
the
net
upshot
of
these
attempts
was
that
stringent
orders
were
issued
about
leaving
boats
in
the
channel
or
on
the
shores
of
the
island
unpadlocked
for
the
rest
the
commandant
was
satisfied
with
his
second
line
of
defence
the
water
which
was
moreover
it
was
now
growing
daily
colder
and
more
unattractive
such
was
the
position
when
the
holzminden
trio
began
to
put
their
heads
together
i
do
not
think
any
of
us
seriously
entertained
the
idea
of
an
escape
by
water
we
were
all
hopeless
landsmen
and
gilbert
at
any
rate
could
not
swim
a
by
sea
necessitated
a
combination
of
luck
pluck
opportunism
and
above
all
watermanship
our
armament
such
as
it
was
was
of
a
different
kind
we
all
knew
german
gilbert
and
i
indifferently
ortweiler
fluently
we
had
the
wherewithal
to
bribe
we
could
lay
our
hands
on
a
typewriter
we
knew
the
ropes
of
a
land
journey
by
railway
and
had
both
been
the
latter
more
than
once
and
i
had
heard
these
things
much
discussed
moreover
gilbert
being
a
major
had
secured
a
small
room
which
he
invited
me
to
share
and
ortweiler
was
a
member
of
our
mess
in
a
scheme
privacy
is
almost
an
essential
greatest
asset
of
all
the
germans
were
not
suspicious
and
they
left
us
alone
our
idea
very
much
in
the
rough
crystallised
as
follows
together
or
events
might
bluff
the
sentry
at
the
main
gate
and
at
the
ferry
to
get
on
to
the
mainland
and
there
travel
by
train
to
the
holland
frontier
and
to
have
our
preparations
so
thoroughly
made
that
on
paper
at
least
our
plan
was
bound
to
be
successful
our
first
idea
was
to
three
or
four
others
and
go
out
as
a
party
of
orderlies
with
one
of
us
disguised
as
a
german
sentry
in
charge
individual
officers
had
on
several
occasions
already
been
into
the
town
with
a
party
of
orderlies
on
some
or
other
in
order
to
have
a
look
round
our
idea
was
to
concoct
some
imaginary
fatigue
which
would
take
us
not
only
into
the
town
but
out
of
it
where
we
should
have
an
opportunity
of
assuming
our
real
disguise
and
separating
on
our
respective
routes
we
got
so
far
as
to
fashion
out
our
bogus
rifle
in
the
rough
but
before
very
long
we
discarded
the
whole
idea
for
various
reasons
the
rifle
would
be
too
difficult
to
imitate
to
pass
in
broad
daylight
we
could
not
be
certain
of
securing
the
uniform
of
our
sentry
all
the
sentries
on
duty
in
the
camp
were
likely
to
be
personally
known
to
one
another

passport
forged
on

was
in
possession

we
doubted
its

two
latter

i
was
content
to
leave
to
the
last
moment

i
should
have
definitely
decided
on
my
route

the
feeling
that
it
was
absurd
to
spend
hours
on
acquiring
articles
necessary
only
for
the
last
lap
when
one
might
be
stopped
at
the
curiously
illogical
reasoning
as
these
things
or
at
least
one
of
them
are
indispensable
for
even
a
short
journey
across
country
but
there
it
was
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
event
occurred
which
led
me
definitely
to
abandon
my
holland
scheme
and
decide
for
the
danish
border
a
german
private
soldier
came
into
our
room
one
day
to
do
some
work
he
was
in
uniform
but
was
on
leave
in
stralsund
which
was
his
home
and
in
the
then
prevailing
shortage
of
labour
he
was
lending
a
hand
to
his
erstwhile
master
no
ever
omits
a
he
can
speak
german
at
profiting
by
a
conversation
with
someone
from
outside
the
camp
indeed
this
was
so
well
known
to
the
authorities
that
in
most
camps
anybody
coming
in
from
outside
was
escorted
by
a
sentry
and
not
left
alone
during
the
period
of
his
stay
in
the
camp
stralsund
was
an
exception
possibly
because
the
english
had
been
there
so
short
a
time
possibly
because
of
the
complacent
idea
as
to
its
security
be
that
as
it
may
i
had
this
fellow
fairly
quickly
sized
up
it
turned
out
his
job
was
doing
sentry
on
the
denmark
border
it
dull
there
many
get
over
up
there
prisoners
few
but
smugglers
and
deserters
mostly
we
pretend
not
to
see
here
was
an
i
threw
caution
to
the
winds
and
found
that
i
had
not
mistaken
my
man
he
was
a
genial
rascal
venal
and
disloyal
to
the
core
before
he
had
been
in
that
room
half
an
hour
he
had
committed
himself
far
too
deeply
in
the
eyes
of
the
german
law
for
me
to
have
any
fear
that
he
would
turn
round
and
blow
the
gaff
on
he
told
us
gilbert
had
come
in
by
that
time
of
a
slackly
guarded
frontier
with
wire
so
low
that
you
could
walk
over
it
of
the
exact
route
from
stralsund
to
the
last
station
outside
the
border
territory
of
the
innocuous
passage
of
an
ordinary
slow
train
without
the
complications
of
or
examination
over
the
dreaded
kiel
canal
he
came
in
next
day
with
some
civilian
collars
and
ties
and
an
inadequate
railway
map
and
on
each
day
he
went
out
the
heavier
by
sundry
woollen
and
flannel
clothes
cigarettes
soap
chocolate
and
cheese
he
gave
me
in
return
about
marks
in
german
money
he
had
promised
to
do
even
more
but
he
made
some
excuse
that
his
leave
was
up
and
we
saw
him
no
more
probably
he
funked
it
viewed
as
a
commercial
deal
the
balance
was
in
his
favour
but
he
had
given
us
information
that
was
beyond
rubies
our
hopes
rose
higher
and
by
this
time
gilbert
and
i
were
more
or
less
definitely
committed
to
the
denmark
scheme
we
had
not
long
to
wait
for
an
opportunity
of
seeing
how
our
passports
should
read
i
will
say
no
more
even
at
this
distance
of
time
immeasurably
magnified
by
the
intervening
events
there
still
may
lurk
the
long
arm
in
german
law
and
we
need
not
doubt
that
there
are
still
too
many
souls
in
germany
attracted
by
the
thought
soll
ich
detective
werden
how
shall
i
become
a
detective
to
make
it
altogether
safe
for
those
concerned
if
i
were
to
be
more
explicit
in
print
suffice
it
to
say
that
our
tools
were
of
tender
years
cheaply
bought
and
therefore
on
both
accounts
the
less
deserving
of
retribution
i
had
sold
my
field
service
ration
boots
for
marks
through
the
agency
of
ortweiler
i
had
therefore
collected
about
marks
and
this
was
of
course
ample
for
my
requirements
i
was
all
the
time
anxiously
on
the
for
civilian
clothes
i
had
got
a
pair
of
old
blue
trousers
from
captain
clarke
of
the
merchant
marine
i
had
an
old
pair
of
ration
boots
which
on
comparison
with
the
article
might
just
i
had
shirt
collar
and
tie
i
wanted
hat
coat
and
in
view
of
the
lateness
of
the
season
some
sort
of
overcoat
footnote
this
chapter
was
written
over
a
year
ago
and
times
have
changed
we
borrowed
the
passport
off
a
boy
who
used
to
come
into
the
camp
and
we
sold
our
boots
to
one
of
the
camp
canteen
officials
who
was
distinctly
venal
by
great
good
luck
the
hat
or
as
it
happened
cap
materialised
a
new
naval
suit
with
cap
had
arrived
for
a
merchant
skipper
who
had
gone
to
aachen
for
a
medical
board
with
the
hope
of
exchange
as
soon
as
we
had
heard
he
had
been
passed
and
gone
over
the
border
and
i
promptly
closed
for
the
suit
of
which
we
had
secured
the
refusal
with
his
shorn
of
its
buttons
the
suit
made
a
smart
civilian
costume
for
gilbert
and
shorn
of
its
badge
the
cap
became
merely
of
the
naval
type
of
headgear
so
common
amongst
german
boys
or
men
of
the
i
had
always
decided
i
would
shape
my
rôle
according
to
the
clothes
which
i
could
find
and
i
now
decided
that
i
should
travel
class
as
some
sort
of
mechanic
for
a
coat
i
had
to
fall
back
upon
a
brand
new
english
coat
sent
out
from
home
and
confiscated
by
and
restolen
from
the
germans
i
made
it
as
shabby
as
i
could
in
the
short
time
at
my
disposal
but
even
so
it
was
far
too
smart
to
pass
for
my
class
of
except
at
night
i
therefore
decided
that
if
travelling
by
day
i
would
wear
over
my
coat
a
very
old
dark
blue
naval
raincoat
which
had
been
given
me
i
was
thus
equipped
i
might
possibly
have
done
better
if
i
had
waited
but
the
completion
of
my
arrangements
had
to
synchronise
as
far
as
possible
with
that
of
the
others
i
had
also
been
able
to
copy
a
fairly
good
map
of
northern
schleswig
showing
roads
and
railways
and
by
great
good
luck
and
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
secured
what
i
believe
was
the
last
compass
but
one
in
the
whole
camp
the
shortage
of
these
articles
seemed
extraordinary
when
one
reflected
on
the
abundance
of
them
in
most
of
the
old
camps
of
longer
standing
to
the
donor
on
this
occasion
i
am
eternally
indebted
as
i
could
not
have
managed
very
well
without
it
from
one
of
the
camp
personnel
i
had
elucidated
the
fact
that
the
hamburg
train
went
at
in
the
morning
from
another
source
we
heard
there
was
also
a
train
at
in
the
evening
gilbert
meanwhile
had
been
busy
with
the
typewriter
which
he
had
secured
with
great
forethought
from
its
owner
in
the
aachen
party
the
forms
were
completed

according
to
our
own

with

of

he
had
acquired
a
good
flowing

and
he
filled
the
particulars
in
himself
with
a
flourish
for
the
signature
of

at
the

he
also
filled
in

we
had
each
two
passports
one
made
out
as
from
stralsund
and
the
other
as
from
schleswig
we
should
naturally
show
the
stralsund
one
in
the
schleswig
territory
and
we
were
now
ready
or
as
ready
as
anyone
is
until
the
actual
time
comes
to
go
when
there
are
always
a
thousand
and
one
things
to
be
thought
of
it
was
arranged
amongst
ourselves
that
ortweiler
should
have
the
first
shot
as
he
stood
easily
the
best
chance
of
effecting
escape
accordingly
on
monday
the
october
he
made
his
exit
he
was
well
made
up
with
a
false
moustache
stuck
on
with
some
very
diluted
form
of
spirit
gum
and
fiercely
curved
at
the
tips
it
was
only
tow
but
it
served
its
purpose
in
the
dark
our
duty
was
to
patrol
the
avenue
leading
to
the
main
gate
between
and
to
mark
down
what
dangerous
germans
had
left
the
camp
and
to
stop
if
anyone
who
was
likely
to
suspect
him
hove
in
sight
i
should
mention
here
that
from
the
barrack
selected
as
dressing
room
to
the
main
gate
is
about
yards
from
the
main
gate
on
to
the
ferry
is
another
yards
after
dark
at
this
time
of
year
various
germans
living
in
the
town
were
likely
to
be
leaving
the
island
for
the
night
and
the
ferry
was
thus
constantly
on
the
move
our
object
was
primarily
to
avoid
the
more
dangerous
germans
an
officer
or
the
interpreter
who
knew
us
all
well
by
sight
all
went
well
i
gave
the
signal
at
about
and
and
i
piloted
ortweiler
out
slowing
down
as
he
passed
us
yards
from
the
main
gate
we
saw
him
take
out
his
card
and
hand
it
to
the
sentry
who
then
let
him
through
the
postern
it
had
worked
we
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
just
as
we
were
going
back
we
met
the
interpreter
homeward
bound
for
the
ferry
he
was
too
close
behind
to
be
exactly
safe
so
i
engaged
him
in
conversation
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
i
could
only
think
of
something
rather
fatuous
to
say
but
i
held
him
up
a
minute
or
two
and
that
may
have
caused
him
to
miss
particular
boat
footnote
i
have
since
heard
that
they
went
over
the
ferry
together
we
at
is
a
familiar
device
for
concealing
escape
the
result
was
that
the
barrack
feldwebel
did
not
report
his
absence
till
next
day
at
he
had
thus
twelve
clear
start
by
which
time
he
was
most
of
the
way
to
berlin
we
thought
him
almost
a
certainty
to
get
over
with
his
fluent
knowledge
of
german
and
he
did
in
point
of
fact
escape
into
holland
berlin
frankfort
and
crefeld
after
a
thrilling
experience
on
the
actual
border
which
would
be
a
story
in
itself
and
i
were
naturally
elated
the
more
so
as
from
enquiries
it
transpired
that
the
authorities
had
absolutely
no
suspicion
of
how
had
got
out
owing
to
repeated
and
escapes
into
the
island
the
guard
had
been
increased
and
placed
outside
the
wire
no
one
had
passed
the
sentries
who
had
not
the
proper
credentials
of
that
they
were
quite
convinced
it
was
believed
that
he
was
still
hiding
in
the
camp
we
hugged
ourselves
friday
of
that
week
the
the
day
selected
as
was
an
unforgettable
one
our
kit
had
to
be
packed
and
labelled
final
arrangements
made
about
feeding
in
the
event
of
recapture
compromising
documents
of
any
sort
had
to
be
destroyed
at
the
last
moment
i
realised
that
i
had
no
braces
no
german
cigarettes
and
no
matches
to
crown
all
there
was
a
barrack
hockey
match
which
we
could
not
very
well
avoid
during
the
day
it
so
happened
that
we
were
twice
invaded
by
feldwebels
on
the
first
occasion
the
door
was
locked
and
we
had
to
throw
a
map
into
the
corner
and
then
open
the
door
an
action
which
would
in
itself
have
been
of
damning
suspicion
in
most
camps
on
the
second
the
feldwebel
found
cutting
sandwiches
of
german
war
bread
had
to
explain
that
it
was
a
new
attempt
to
make
palatable
and
invited
the
feldwebel
to
come
and
see
the
result
at
dinner
time
doubtless
he
came
but
there
were
no
sandwiches
and
no
us
at
we
had
our
high
copenhagen
eggs
each
and
tea
and
jam
at
the
roll
was
called
and
immediately
after
it
we
started
transferring
our
disguise
under
cover
of
the
growing
darkness
to
the
barrack
from
which
we
were
going
to
make
our
final
exit
it
had
been
arranged
after
some
discussion
that
gilbert
should
leave
not
before
dark
and
not
later
than
and
that
i
should
give
him
ten
minutes
clear
before
leaving
this
would
give
me
little
time
to
catch
the
train
to
hamburg
if
i
was
at
all
held
up
a
forecast
which
was
verified
by
events
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
it
was
necessary
that
disguise
should
be
assisted
to
the
full
by
darkness
we
had
let
a
few
friends
into
the
secret
and
these
were
cruising
about
like
destroyers
up
and
down
the
avenue
reporting
the
departure
of
dangerous
germans
gilbert
did
not
eventually
get
off
much
before
and
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
the
leader
of
the
convoy
reported
that
was
safely
through
the
gate
i
gave
him
ten
minutes
conscious
mainly
of
the
fact
that
i
had
forgotten
any
german
i
had
ever
learnt
and
then
stepped
forth
i
was
karl
stein
firm
of
karl
stein
furniture
dealers
langestrasse
stralsund
i
had
been
into
the
kommandantur
to
arrange
about
a
new
contract
for
cupboards
i
knew
the
shop
because
i
had
seen
it
the
day
before
when
i
went
to
the
town
hospital
under
escort
with
a
party
of
officers
for
massage
i
needed
no
massage
of
course
but
had
only
done
this
to
acquaint
myself
with
the
geography
of
the
town
with
a
blank
stare
i
passed
several
walking
up
and
down
the
avenue
and
reached
the
gate
my
great
moment
had
come
but
the
sentry
simply
looked
at
my
card
carefully
said
and
handed
it
back
i
walked
very
fast
down
to
the
ferry
there
was
no
boat
on
my
side
and
i
saw
i
should
have
to
wait
some
minutes
the
sentry
at
the
ferry
examined
my
card
and
handed
it
back
how
should
i
avoid
the
two
germans
who
were
already
there
on
the
jetty
waiting
for
the
boat
i
decided
to
have
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
i
must
here
mention
that
my
knowledge
of
german
acquired
during
captivity
was
not
such
as
would
enable
me
to
support
a
of
more
than
a
minute
or
two
i
had
however
practised
the
german
accent
with
assiduity
in
point
of
fact
i
hardly
spoke
a
hundred
words
on
the
journey
and
some
of
these
were
not
absolutely
necessary
at
last
the
ferry
boat
came
over
empty
i
got
in
and
sat
in
the
bows
there
was
an
english
orderly
working
the
bow
had
seen
him
the
previous
day
i
kicked
him
and
he
realised
what
i
was
and
shielded
me
as
much
as
he
could
from
the
other
occupants
of
the
boat
which
was
now
gradually
filling
it
was
a
long
five
minutes
and
i
continued
my
violent
fit
of
coughing
leaning
over
the
side
as
if
in
a
paroxysm
there
were
two
germans
in
the
bows
and
one
of
them
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
suggested
that
i
should
trim
the
boat
by
sitting
in
the
middle
i
complied
meekly
feeling
really
very
wretched
indeed
at
the
last
i
thought
i
was
really
done
for
the
german
adjutant
got
into
the
boat
he
know
me
by
sight
but
i
thought
it
was
more
than
likely
that
he
would
suspect
me
mercifully
he
began
to
talk
to
some
lady
typists
from
the
camp
who
had
just
preceded
him
we
shoved
off
eventually
almost
full
i
continued
coughing
till
we
got
across
when
the
boat
discharged
i
went
ashore
almost
last
i
gave
them
a
wide
berth
in
front
and
as
soon
as
i
was
clear
made
off
at
my
best
pace
for
the
station
now
i
was
karl
stein
of
schleswig
carpenter
man
and
recalled
for
civilian
employment
catching
the
train
for
his
native
country
i
tore
up
my
and
dropped
it
in
the
month
off
my
sentence
anyway
as
i
expected
i
just
missed
my
train
i
had
no
watch
but
the
clock
on
the
marianne
kirche
showed
me
i
should
be
late
i
reached
the
station
about
it
was
rather
full
of
people
i
wondered
if
gilbert
was
away
in
that
train
and
then
vaguely
what
the
chances
were
of
my
being
nabbed
before
the
next
i
noted
was
at
the
next
morning
saturday
i
think
if
there
had
been
any
outgoing
trains
that
night
i
should
have
taken
them
even
though
they
led
me
east
instead
of
west
but
as
it
happened
there
were
none
i
went
into
the
lavatory
in
the
station
shut
myself
in
a
closet
and
reflected
i
thought
at
that
time
to
my
horror
that
i
had
forgotten
my
matches
so
i
denied
myself
a
matches
turned
up
later
and
i
needed
what
few
there
were
i
solaced
myself
with
a
slab
of
chocolate
the
position
was
not
encouraging
our
information
about
trains
was
correct
our
friends
would
not
be
able
to
camouflage
our
absence
which
would
certainly
be
discovered
by
reported
by
it
was
more
than
likely
that
they
would
telephone
to
the
station
i
determined
not
to
be
in
the
station
at
all
between
and
if
i
was
arrested
next
morning
i
was
in
the
meantime
it
was
good
to
be
free
it
was
a
beautiful
october
night
in
stralsund
i
braced
myself
up
and
begged
a
light
for
a
cigarette
from
a
youngster
at
a
street
corner
and
then
strolled
along
the
streets
that
led
from
the
station
to
the
kirche
i
knew
these
now
quite
well
enough
not
to
get
lost
i
sat
on
a
bench
and
looked
across
the
moonlit
water
which
near
the
station
runs
right
in
in
a
broad
and
lovely
sweep
i
lit
a
pipe
from
my
german
cigarette
and
smoked
comfortably
should
i
get
off
next
morning
i
was
cooling
down
now
and
wandered
down
past
the
marianne
kirche
to
a
cinema
in
the
langestrasse
a
boy
there
told
me
the
booking
office
was
shut
i
wandered
round
and
round
till
one
i
sat
for
a
long
time
on
my
old
bench
overlooking
the
water
at
another
place
i
entered
a
private
garden
and
sheltered
for
an
hour
under
a
wall
right
on
the
edge
it
was
blowing
fairly
fresh
about
one
i
returned
to
the
station
and
entered
the
waiting
room
full
of
recumbent
figures
mostly
soldiers
and
sailors
i
got
hold
of
two
chairs
and
tried
to
sleep
there
was
a
sailor
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
at
i
got
up
and
had
a
cup
of
coffee
the
waiting
room
was
now
fairly
full
of
people
most
of
them
presumably
going
by
my
train
i
had
by
now
a
two
growth
of
beard
and
my
moustache
was
fairly
long
and
well
down
over
the
corners
of
my
mouth
moreover
i
had
had
a
fairly
sleepless
night
in
my
pockets
i
carried
three
large
sandwiches
of
german
bread
with
english
potted
meat
inside
about
twenty
slabs
of
marching
chocolate
a
box
of
milk
tablets
a
spare
pair
of
socks
some
rag
and
vaseline
my
pipe
and
tobacco
english
and
german
cigarettes
my
compass
money
and
papers
i
had
an
old
german
novel
in
my
hands
which
i
pretended
to
read
with
great
assiduity
half
an
hour
before
the
train
was
due
to
start
i
went
to
the
booking
office
i
was
surprised
to
hear
my
own
voice
to
hamburg
i
had
no
idea
what
it
cost
so
i
tendered
a
note
the
ticket
cost
only
seven
marks
i
went
back
to
the
waiting
room
and
a
few
minutes
later
faced
the
barrier
no
questions
no
suspicion
i
breathed
again
and
wondered
what
that
commandant
had
done
wired
to
rostock
perhaps
my
carriage
was
not
at
the
or
five
women
and
two
elderly
men
i
had
no
trouble
with
them
their
conversation
began
and
maintained
itself
exclusively
about
food
but
they
were
cheerful
enough
before
rostock
the
carriage
had
filled
up
and
i
with
british
politeness
was
an
old
woman
began
asking
me
to
shift
her
basket
i
could
not
exactly
understand
what
she
wanted
and
must
have
looked
rather
foolish
however
i
did
the
right
thing
eventually
we
changed
at
rostock
i
was
half
expecting
trouble
but
nothing
happened
a
porter
told
me
the
platform
for
the
hamburg
train
i
got
this
stereotyped
question
fairly
pat
to
hamburg
the
train
was
overflowing
we
were
over
in
a
tiny
compartment
i
was
wedged
in
against
the
window
at
one
intermediate
station
a
young
soldier
got
in
with
a
goose
hanging
out
of
his
haversack
he
immediately
became
the
centre
of
an
admiring
throng
he
was
a
cheerful
youth
and
bandied
repartee
with
all
and
could
not
catch
his
sallies
which
were
in
low
german
and
greeted
with
roars
of
laughter
i
suppose
he
was
the
son
of
some
farmer
and
had
this
goose
which
would
probably
have
fetched
marks
in
the
market
to
take
back
to
his
he
got
out
just
before
hamburg
i
could
not
have
asked
for
a
better
foil
hamburg
i
had
never
hoped
for
even
so
long
a
run
as
this
was
there
really
a
chance
in
any
case
i
was
now
well
clear
of
the
stralsund
zone
i
began
to
realise
that
the
heavy
traffic
was
helping
me
and
that
i
was
indeed
no
more
than
a
needle
in
a
haystack
i
ate
a
sandwich
and
an
apple
which
i
had
bought
at
lubeck
we
ran
into
the
big
station
at
about
in
the
was
very
full
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
find
the
notices
kiel
i
took
my
place
in
the
for
the
fourth
class
booking
office
behind
me
two
women
had
an
altercation
as
to
priority
of
place
in
the
i
was
rather
afraid
they
were
going
to
appeal
to
me
i
had
no
wish
for
the
rôle
of
solomon
at
that
moment
i
booked
direct
to
four
made
my
way
downstairs
to
the
departure
platform
which
was
indicated
clearly
enough
i
did
not
like
the
odd
quarter
of
an
hour
which
i
had
to
wait
before
the
train
came
in
i
was
not
very
happy
about
my
dark
blue
waterproof
i
could
not
see
anything
approaching
its
counterpart
if
one
stands
still
one
can
be
examined
at
leisure
if
one
moves
up
and
down
one
runs
the
gauntlet
of
a
hundred
restless
eyes
any
one
pair
of
which
may
at
some
previous
date
have
had
first
hand
cognisance
of
a
typical
naval
english
waterproof
then
i
blundered
there
was
a
on
the
platform
i
went
up
to
it
and
asked
for
a
cup
i
had
drunk
nothing
since
in
the
morning
fortunately
neither
of
the
in
the
stall
paid
any
attention
to
me
just
then
i
saw
the
notice
soldiers
and
sailors
printed
up
in
big
letters
i
should
have
known
that
but
no
one
had
noticed
anything
when
that
train
come
in
it
came
at
last
i
chose
the
carriage
with
fewest
soldiers
in
it
and
most
women
and
made
for
my
strategical
position
by
the
window
but
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
men
altogether
i
had
one
next
to
me
from
hamburg
to
kiel
everybody
started
chattering
at
once
how
could
i
keep
out
of
this
all
the
way
to
kiel
without
suspicion
of
course
they
were
talking
about
ways
of
dishing
up
potatoes
i
looked
out
of
the
window
pretending
to
be
interested
in
the
country
it
was
impossible
even
to
pretend
to
read
in
that
crush
a
man
on
the
seat
was
forcibly
expressing
his
views
to
two
on
the
new
war
loan
they
giggled
i
often
wonder
if
those
hamburg
folk
then
had
any
notion
that
another
fortnight
would
see
the
red
flag
floating
in
their
midst
at
neumünster
we
had
an
invasion
the
carriage
full
already
became
packed
four
girls
of
the
farmer
i
judged
in
at
my
window
i
lost
my
place
of
vantage
and
was
relegated
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
i
felt
a
youth
quite
close
to
me
sizing
me
up
fortunately
the
farmer
girls
riveted
all
attention
for
half
a
dozen
stations
they
were
in
boisterous
spirits
and
screamed
with
laughter
at
their
own
jokes
they
spoke
dialect
and
i
could
not
understand
them
but
i
grinned
feebly
in
unison
when
they
got
out
i
recovered
my
post
by
the
window
bless
them
anyway
for
a
diversion
at
the
next
station
an
elderly
man
who
was
sitting
on
a
basket
immediately
in
front
of
me
said
something
to
me
directly
he
was
not
in
any
way
a
formidable
character
but
he
spoke
villainous
dialect
and
i
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
his
question
he
was
referring
to
something
in
the
station
i
said
and
looked
out
of
the
window
in
a
knowing
way
but
i
could
not
risk
a
second
question
i
felt
the
eyes
on
me
again
and
i
made
a
for
the
lavatory
when
i
emerged
i
took
up
a
fresh
position
the
train
was
emptying
as
we
approached
kiel
and
for
a
time
i
got
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
enjoyed
the
draught
then
a
little
girl
standing
by
me
asked
me
to
pull
up
the
window
again
i
had
my
second
sandwich
we
ran
into
kiel
at
about
there
was
no
difficulty
a
guard
in
answer
to
my
question
pointed
at
the
flensburg
train
the
carriage
i
got
into
was
not
lit
at
all
and
almost
empty
what
a
relief
to
sit
a
girl
came
in
to
check
my
ticket
and
i
went
to
sleep
we
went
over
the
canal
in
the
dark
there
were
two
men
in
my
carriage
i
woke
up
at
some
wayside
station
and
asked
if
it
was
flensburg
they
laughed
and
said
flensburg
was
two
hours
away
yet
i
muttered
sleepily
that
i
was
a
stranger
and
pretended
to
drop
off
again
i
reached
flensburg
about
and
thought
of
the
unforgettable
scene
in
riddle
of
the
i
was
no
less
depressed
than
carruthers
on
that
occasion
i
was
very
thirsty
but
it
was
a
poky
little
station
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
shape
of
a
waiting
room
or
i
lingered
on
the
platform
and
saw
a
porter
who
appeared
to
be
closing
down
for
the
night
i
asked
him
what
time
the
train
to
tondern
went
next
day
he
first
said
but
then
reflected
that
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
there
would
not
be
a
train
till
eleven
he
added
that
the
train
went
from
the
other
station
so
there
were
two
stations
in
flensburg
my
sentry
friend
had
not
told
me
this
i
asked
him
where
the
other
station
was
and
he
directed
me
my
german
at
this
juncture
was
so
abominable
that
i
think
he
must
have
been
a
dane
at
the
other
station
which
i
found
to
be
the
main
one
there
was
a
fairly
large
crowd
in
the
booking
hall
they
were
waiting
for
the
train
from
the
north
entry
to
the
platform
and
waiting
rooms
was
barred
the
train
came
in
the
crowd
dissolved
and
the
station
was
shut
up
for
the
night
i
had
got
to
put
in
twelve
dreary
hours
in
this
place
i
took
risks
that
night
in
flensburg
risks
that
might
have
been
fatal
further
south
i
argued
that
here
if
anywhere
one
might
expect
to
find
a
man
with
a
nautical
cap
and
overcoat
i
walked
for
about
an
hour
past
the
quays
past
the
two
main
hotels
then
up
towards
the
church
and
down
again
to
the
quays
i
could
find
no
public
which
was
what
i
was
looking
for
but
i
had
learned
the
rough
geography
of
the
place
there
was
a
low
barrier
leading
on
to
one
of
the
quays
the
gate
was
locked
but
i
climbed
the
barrier
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
behind
me
was
one
of
those
pavilions
such
as
are
seen
on
an
english
in
front
a
steamer
moored
alongside
both
were
quite
deserted
here
at
least
i
could
sit
and
find
solitude
i
took
off
my
boots
and
attended
to
one
of
my
toes
which
i
had
rubbed
playing
hockey
the
day
weeks
ago
it
seemed
i
went
through
my
pockets
my
matches
i
smoked
a
luxurious
pipe
then
still
in
my
socks
i
boarded
the
steamer
and
searched
her
for
water
without
success
she
was
fitted
up
for
passengers
and
for
a
moment
i
entertained
the
idea
of
stowing
myself
away
on
her
just
as
i
had
finished
putting
on
my
boots
again
a
i
suppose
he
on
to
the
quay
from
the
left
he
must
have
been
attracted
by
some
movement
i
confess
i
thought
it
was
all
up
are
you
doing
here
you
have
no
business
to
be
here
at
silence
implied
assent
he
beckoned
me
after
him
he
was
not
a
prussian
this
man
whatever
else
he
was
perhaps
he
was
afraid
of
me
he
appeared
to
be
taking
me
into
some
form
of
building
on
my
right
i
pretended
to
be
coming
along
after
him
but
i
swerved
to
the
right
scrambled
over
the
barrier
and
ran
for
yards
down
the
street
fortunately
there
was
no
one
about
i
was
not
followed
i
was
thankful
i
had
got
my
boots
on
in
time
i
passed
the
first
hotel
and
saw
a
woman
with
a
man
carrying
her
bag
go
in
and
ask
for
a
room
she
got
one
i
followed
in
after
her
and
asked
for
a
bed
the
proprietor
said
he
was
full
up
and
shut
the
door
in
my
face
could
a
two
growth
of
beard
make
such
a
difference
in
a
man
i
was
rather
hurt
but
worse
was
to
follow
i
entered
another
hotel
and
saw
some
german
sailors
being
given
the
keys
of
their
bedrooms
by
a
fraulein
i
asked
her
for
some
coffee
to
drink
i
came
to
my
senses
and
fled
i
went
up
towards
the
church
which
stands
on
the
top
of
a
steep
hill
there
are
some
gardens
sloping
down
the
hill
i
found
an
old
sort
of
in
one
of
these
and
went
to
sleep
it
was
about
and
none
too
warm
i
was
up
at
dawn
and
started
again
on
my
weary
pilgrimage
of
the
streets
of
flensburg
how
i
hated
that
place
i
half
thought
of
altering
my
plan
and
doing
the
rest
of
the
journey
on
foot
it
was
about
kilometres
to
the
frontier
i
passed
three
military
policemen
in
half
an
hour
and
wondered
resentfully
what
they
were
doing
in
such
large
quantities
on
a
morning
at
about
eight
i
got
to
the
station
and
ate
my
last
sandwich
assuming
that
the
porter
had
been
right
the
previous
night
i
had
got
to
put
in
three
hours
more
dreary
waiting
there
were
no
overhead
notices
but
i
noticed
a
collection
of
stuck
up
on
big
boards
in
a
little
alcove
just
out
of
the
booking
hall
if
i
could
get
behind
the
rearmost
of
these
i
could
put
in
much
of
my
time
unobserved
people
might
come
and
people
might
go
but
they
would
never
dream
that
i
had
been
there
all
the
time
i
examined
the
i
could
make
nothing
of
the
sunday
trains
but
i
found
the
name
that
had
been
the
station
given
by
our
informant
at
stralsund
as
the
last
station
outside
the
in
the
maps
we
had
seen
in
the
camp
we
had
never
been
able
to
verify
this
place
must
be
on
the
main
line
running
up
the
east
schleswig
coast
so
far
so
good
but
at
what
time
would
this
train
go
it
could
not
be
the
same
train
as
the
tondern
train
for
tondern
is
west
schleswig
i
wandered
on
to
the
platform
the
bookstall
was
open
and
i
bought
a
paper
and
also
a
pocket
railway
guide
the
guide
had
a
good
map
i
saw
from
this
that
the
tondern
and
lines
branched
off
at
the
two
trains
went
in
one
as
far
as
tingleff
i
had
not
long
to
wait
for
corroboration
at
the
i
heard
a
man
ask
the
attendant
what
time
the
train
went
for
a
station
which
i
knew
to
be
north
of
on
the
same
line
the
answer
was
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
now
i
booked
for
illustration
sketch
map
of
germany
and
frontiers
shaded
area
neutral
country
x
point
where
the
author
crossed
the
frontier
i
had
still
an
hour
to
wait
it
passed
somehow
i
went
into
the
waiting
room
and
got
my
first
drink
for
hours
a
glass
of
beer
it
was
washy
stuff
but
went
down
wonderfully
well
there
were
a
lot
of
sailors
in
the
waiting
room
some
of
them
stared
at
me
and
i
began
to
have
the
hamburg
platform
haunted
sensation
over
again
i
pretended
to
read
my
paper
fiercely
for
half
an
hour
and
then
went
on
to
the
platform
i
began
to
regret
that
i
had
not
had
a
shave
that
morning
the
train
came
in
punctually
there
was
no
incident
till
tingleff
about
kilos
northward
there
i
saw
the
passport
officials
waiting
on
the
platform
i
had
almost
forgotten
about
this
part
of
the
business
i
took
a
sudden
resolution
and
left
the
train
i
reckoned
that
i
had
not
more
than
miles
to
walk
from
this
point
and
by
alighting
here
i
might
dodge
the
passport
men
altogether
but
i
was
undeceived
an
official
was
waiting
at
the
entrance
to
the
he
looked
an
fellow
and
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
someone
he
took
my
passport
glanced
at
it
and
handed
it
back
without
a
word
he
did
not
even
look
to
compare
my
face
with
the
photograph
the
great
moment
which
gilbert
and
i
had
rehearsed
countless
times
had
come
and
gone
i
hurried
through
the
and
saw
another
passport
official
talking
to
the
ticket
collector
i
handed
in
my
ticket
the
man
looked
up
in
some
surprise
but
i
was
ready
for
him
have
shortened
my
he
asked
no
more
questions
if
he
had
i
doubt
if
i
could
have
answered
them
i
was
conscious
only
of
one
great
wish
to
be
rid
of
the
railway
for
good
i
struck
due
north
out
of
the
station
and
found
myself
in
a
i
was
so
overjoyed
to
be
quit
of
the
rail
that
i
plunged
into
the
fields
i
had
not
gone
very
far
before
i
had
reason
to
repent
there
was
water
everywhere
and
i
made
very
heavy
weather
of
it
my
objective
was
lügumkloster
about
miles
from
tingleff
and
i
reckoned
that
it
could
not
be
very
long
before
i
struck
the
main
road
after
about
two
was
now
two
in
the
found
the
road
there
were
very
few
people
about
and
those
i
met
gave
me
good
day
civilly
enough
if
questioned
at
this
point
i
was
going
to
have
been
a
south
german
staying
with
relatives
in
flensburg
and
out
for
a
improbable
enough
story
my
hopes
had
risen
and
it
all
seemed
reasonably
plain
sailing
now
the
people
were
not
suspicious
i
had
my
map
with
a
few
important
names
my
compass
i
might
even
do
it
in
the
next
night
i
wondered
exactly
where
old
gilbert
was
at
this
moment
it
never
even
occurred
to
me
that
he
had
been
caught
but
such
as
afterwards
transpired
must
have
been
the
case
footnote
gilbert
had
been
caught
actually
on
the
border
the
night
before
under
the
impression
that
he
was
already
in
denmark
he
was
thought
at
first
to
be
a
smuggler
passing
through
one
village
i
met
some
french
prisoners
i
gave
them
good
day
and
told
them
who
i
was
they
invited
me
to
come
into
their
room
in
the
farm
where
they
were
working
they
were
able
to
tell
me
what
village
i
was
in
dollderup
and
this
was
a
great
assistance
i
thanked
them
in
execrable
french
gave
them
one
of
my
remaining
cigarettes
and
told
them
what
news
i
had
heard
nothing
for
months
i
think
anything
on
the
whole
journey
was
more
difficult
than
framing
those
few
simple
french
sentences
the
signposts
made
the
journey
easy
after
that
at
i
had
kilometres
to
go
to
lügumkloster
i
turned
off
the
road
lay
down
in
some
young
fir
trees
took
off
my
boots
ate
some
chocolate
and
had
half
an
hour
or
sleep
i
started
again
towards
dusk
i
was
feeling
very
fit
now
and
full
of
hope
if
only
i
muck
it
on
the
frontier
the
signposts
did
their
duty
nobly
there
was
a
keen
wind
from
the
north
and
the
road
was
good
i
had
been
out
just
two
complete
days
in
one
village
a
soldier
with
a
rifle
came
out
of
a
house
just
as
i
passed
it
he
replied
to
my
courteously
i
reached
lügumkloster
i
suppose
about
nine
or
ten
it
is
a
big
rambling
village
and
i
made
a
bad
mistake
here
on
leaving
it
i
meant
to
take
the
road
which
runs
roughly
i
took
a
road
running
but
after
about
an
walking
i
found
it
was
leading
me
gradually
more
east
than
had
not
noticed
that
the
wind
had
shifted
from
north
to
east
i
decided
to
leave
the
road
and
make
due
north
on
the
compass
trusting
to
pick
up
the
right
road
later
on
then
began
a
trying
time
the
ground
was
terribly
wet
and
intersected
with
continual
wired
ditches
i
tore
my
clothes
rather
badly
here
and
i
think
my
trousers
at
the
end
of
my
journey
would
have
stood
another
rip
however
i
kept
due
north
tacking
as
little
as
possible
to
avoid
the
ditches
and
eventually
reached
the
road
it
was
i
supposed
about
i
estimated
i
was
still
quite
ten
miles
from
the
frontier
there
was
a
strong
wind
and
i
had
not
enough
matches
to
spare
to
look
more
than
once
or
twice
at
my
map
added
to
this
the
signposts
previously
so
became
infuriating
they
only
mentioned
names
which
i
had
never
heard
of
or
at
least
had
not
committed
to
memory
slog
slog
i
was
getting
tired
a
man
passed
me
with
a
cart
what
on
earth
did
think
he
was
doing
at
that
time
of
night
there
was
lots
of
water
about
and
i
did
not
go
thirsty
my
cap
made
an
effective
cup
a
light
railway
running
parallel
to
the
was
the
light
railway
the
fellow
had
told
us
of
slog
what
on
earth
was
that
a
sentry
box
on
the
roadside
and
in
the
box
a
sentry
yawning
and
stretching
himself
on
each
side
of
the
road
a
belt
of
barbed
wire
running
east
and
west
i
took
these
things
in
vaguely
disconnectedly
had
i
miscalculated
and
was
i
over
the
border
after
all
he
even
challenged
a
mile
later
i
crawled
into
a
little
hollow
by
the
roadside
to
rest
and
get
warm
i
was
getting
strangely
i
remember
addressing
myself
as
a
separate
entity
i
pulled
myself
together
and
sat
down
to
think
must
go
back
and
have
another
look
at
that
wire
it
can
only
be
a
protective
belt
for
military
i
went
back
the
wire
was
there
sure
enough
so
was
the
sentry
box
but
i
go
up
to
it
the
wire
was
like
the
rear
defence
lines
one
had
seen
in
france
i
retraced
my
steps
i
still
had
the
idea
of
picking
myself
up
from
the
hollow
where
i
had
left
myself
i
continued
my
way
praying
for
the
night
to
end
with
the
dawn
i
felt
i
should
be
able
to
think
clearly
again
the
signposts
were
german
enough
anyway
arnum
i
had
made
out
from
my
map
lay
about
three
or
four
kilometres
away
from
the
point
of
the
salient
where
i
meant
to
cross
the
border
it
was
nearly
dawn
and
i
saw
that
i
could
not
get
over
that
night
it
was
getting
light
as
i
reached
the
village
i
left
the
road
and
struck
west
across
the
fields
up
on
to
some
high
ground
somewhere
in
front
there
was
denmark
i
chose
a
hiding
place
in
some
young
firs
and
heather
i
was
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
was
fairly
comfortable
one
more
whole
day
what
an
age
it
seemed
i
got
out
my
railway
map
and
looked
at
my
position
i
could
not
be
more
than
five
or
six
kilometres
from
the
frontier
somewhere
in
the
valley
to
the
stretched
the
line
of
sentries
i
decided
to
sally
forth
while
it
was
still
light
in
the
late
afternoon
take
my
bearings
and
go
over
at
dark
as
i
lay
there
i
heard
footsteps
a
boy
came
by
singing
and
passed
within
two
yards
of
me
he
see
me
just
as
well
perhaps
i
took
off
my
boots
rubbed
my
feet
down
and
had
some
chocolate
about
noon
it
started
raining
and
went
on
for
about
three
hours
i
got
wet
through
but
welcomed
the
rain
on
the
whole
as
it
would
get
darker
sooner
i
was
now
thinking
quite
connectedly
and
it
being
impossible
to
sleep
i
went
over
in
my
mind
again
and
again
what
i
meant
to
do
and
what
i
knew
already
about
the
frontier
i
suppose
it
was
about
when
i
started
out
i
reckoned
there
would
be
about
one
more
daylight
i
steered
due
across
fields
and
marsh
land
for
about
three
kilometres
suddenly
to
my
yards
boxes
came
full
in
view
there
was
no
mistaking
them
about
yards
between
most
of
them
and
quite
yards
between
the
two
opposite
me
i
plumped
down
in
the
heather
where
i
was
standing
and
watched
them
i
saw
a
sentry
leave
his
box
and
walk
about
yards
up
and
down
i
could
see
nothing
that
looked
like
wire
only
marsh
and
heather
in
between
looking
from
where
i
was
into
denmark
there
was
a
farmhouse
immediately
between
the
two
sentry
boxes
i
could
take
my
course
on
would
be
silhouetted
long
after
dark
i
waited
till
it
was
quite
dark
and
then
started
off
taking
no
i
came
to
a
ditch
with
wire
on
each
side
of
it
this
was
the
only
wire
i
saw
when
i
judged
i
was
well
through
the
line
i
got
up
and
walked
to
the
farmhouse
a
tall
figure
answered
my
knock
i
began
in
my
best
german
he
shook
his
head
to
indicate
that
he
understand
i
could
have
kissed
him
at
last
we
hammered
it
out
offizier
fangen
he
beckoned
me
in
with
beaming
face
i
had
made
good
in
just
hours
luck
