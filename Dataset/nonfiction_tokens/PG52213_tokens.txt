and
the

the
first
portion
of
the
journey
is
described
in
a
volume
published
last
summer
entitled
winter
on
the
nile
among
mummies
and
the
second
in
the
following
pages
the
notes
of
the
journey
were
taken
and
the
books
were
written
before
there
were
any
signs
of
the
present
oriental
disturbances
and
the
observations
made
are
therefore
uncolored
by
any
expectation
of
the
existing
state
of
affairs
signs
enough
were
visible
of
a
transition
period
extraordinary
but
hopeful
with
the
existence
of
poverty
oppression
superstition
and
ignorance
were
mingling
occidental
and
christian
influences
the
faint
beginnings
of
a
revival
of
learning
and
the
stronger
pulsations
of
awakening
commercial
and
industrial
life
the
best
hope
of
this
revival
was
their
as
it
is
now
in
peace
and
not
in
war
hartford
november
in
the
levant
jaffa
to
jerusalem
since
jonah
made
his
short
and
ignominious
voyage
along
the
syrian
coast
mariners
have
had
the
same
difficulty
in
getting
ashore
that
the
sailors
experienced
who
attempted
to
land
the
prophet
his
tedious
though
safe
method
of
disembarking
was
not
followed
by
later
navigators
and
the
landing
at
jaffa
has
remained
a
vexatious
and
half
the
time
an
impossible
achievement
the
town
lies
upon
the
open
sea
and
has
no
harbor
it
is
only
in
favorable
weather
that
vessels
can
anchor
within
a
mile
or
so
from
shore
and
the
mediterranean
steamboats
often
pass
the
port
without
being
able
to
land
either
freight
or
passengers
in
the
usual
condition
of
the
sea
the
big
fish
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
discharge
jonah
without
stranding
itself
and
it
seems
that
it
waited
three
days
for
the
favorable
moment
the
best
chance
for
landing
nowadays
is
in
the
early
morning
in
that
calm
period
when
the
winds
and
the
waves
alike
await
the
movements
of
the
sun
it
was
at
that
hour
on
the
of
april
that
we
arrived
from
port
said
on
the
french
steamboat
erymanthe
the
night
had
been
pleasant
and
the
sea
tolerably
smooth
but
not
to
the
apprehensions
of
some
of
the
passengers
who
always
declare
that
they
prefer
now
a
real
tempest
to
a
deceitful
groundswell
on
a
recent
trip
a
party
had
been
prevented
from
landing
owing
to
the
deliberation
of
the
ladies
in
making
their
toilet
by
the
time
they
had
attired
themselves
in
a
proper
manner
to
appear
in
southern
palestine
the
golden
hour
had
slipped
away
and
they
were
able
only
to
look
upon
the
land
which
their
beauty
and
clothes
would
have
adorned
none
of
us
were
caught
in
a
like
delinquency
at
the
moment
the
anchor
went
down
we
were
bargaining
with
a
villain
to
take
us
ashore
a
bargain
in
which
the
yeasty
and
waxingly
uneasy
sea
gave
the
boatman
all
the
advantage
our
little
company
of
four
is
guided
by
the
philosopher
and
dragoman
mohammed
of
cairo
who
has
served
us
during
the
long
voyage
of
the
nile
he
is
assisted
in
his
task
by
the
abyssinian
boy
ahman
abdallah
the
brightest
and
most
faithful
of
servants
in
making
his
first
appearance
in
the
holy
land
he
has
donned
over
his
gay
oriental
costume
a
blue
frank
coat
and
set
his
fez
back
upon
his
head
at
an
angle
exceeding
the
slope
of
his
forehead
his
black
face
has
an
unusual
lustre
and
his
eyes
dance
with
more
than
their
ordinary
merriment
as
he
points
excitedly
to
the
shore
and
cries
the
information
is
addressed
to
madame
whom
ahman
utterly
regardless
of
sex
invariably
addresses
by
the
name
of
one
of
our
travelling
companions
on
the
nile
marm
you
see
him
yâfa
interposed
coming
forward
with
the
air
of
brushing
aside
as
impertinent
the
geographical
information
of
his
subordinate
much
i
tink
but
him
bery
old
let
us
to
go
jaffa
or
yâfa
or
joppa
must
have
been
a
city
since
it
had
maritime
dealings
with
tarshish
in
that
remote
period
in
which
the
quaint
story
of
jonah
is
set
piece
of
hebrew
literature
that
bears
internal
evidence
of
great
antiquity
in
its
extreme
naivete
although
the
canaanites
did
not
come
into
palestine
till
about
that
is
to
say
about
the
time
of
the
twelfth
dynasty
in
egypt
yet
there
is
a
reasonable
tradition
that
jaffa
existed
before
the
deluge
for
ages
it
has
been
the
chief
mediterranean
port
of
great
jerusalem
here
solomon
landed
his
lebanon
timber
for
the
temple
the
town
swarmed
more
than
once
with
the
roman
legions
on
their
way
to
crush
a
jewish
insurrection
it
displayed
the
banner
of
the
saracen
host
a
few
years
after
the
hegira
and
later
when
the
crusaders
erected
the
standard
of
the
cross
on
its
walls
it
was
the
dépôt
of
supplies
which
venice
and
genoa
and
other
rich
cities
contributed
to
the
holy
war
great
kingdoms
and
conquerors
have
possessed
it
in
turn
and
for
thousands
of
years
merchants
have
trusted
their
fortunes
to
its
perilous
roadstead
and
yet
no
one
has
ever
thought
it
worth
while
to
give
it
a
harbor
by
the
construction
of
a
mole
or
a
pier
like
that
at
port
said
i
should
say
that
the
first
requisite
in
the
industrial
to
say
nothing
of
the
moral
regeneration
of
palestine
is
a
harbor
at
jaffa
the
city
is
a
cluster
of
irregular
houses
and
looks
from
the
sea
like
a
brown
bowl
turned
bottom
up
the
roofs
are
terraces
on
which
the
inhabitants
can
sleep
on
summer
nights
and
to
which
they
can
ascend
out
of
the
narrow
streets
to
get
a
whiff
of
sweet
odor
from
the
orange
gardens
which
surround
the
town
the
ordinary
pictures
of
jaffa
do
it
ample
justice
the
chief
feature
in
the
view
is
the
hundreds
of
clumsy
feluccas
tossing
about
in
the
aggravating
waves
diving
endwise
and
dipping
sidewise
guided
a
little
by
the
long
sweeps
of
the
sailors
but
apparently
the
sport
of
the
most
uncertain
billows
a
swarm
of
them
four
or
five
deep
surrounds
our
vessel
they
are
rising
and
falling
in
the
most
sickly
motion
and
dashing
into
each
other
in
the
frantic
efforts
of
their
rowers
to
get
near
the
gangway
ladder
one
minute
the
boat
nearest
the
stairs
rises
as
if
it
would
mount
into
the
ship
and
the
next
it
sinks
below
the
steps
into
a
frightful
gulf
the
passengers
watch
the
passing
opportunity
to
jump
on
board
as
people
dive
into
the
of
a
hotel
freight
is
discharged
into
lighters
that
are
equally
frisky
and
it
is
taken
on
and
off
splashed
with
salt
water
and
liable
to
a
thousand
accidents
in
the
violence
of
the
transit
before
the
town
stretches
a
line
of
rocks
worn
for
ages
upon
which
the
surf
is
breaking
and
sending
white
jets
into
the
air
it
is
through
a
narrow
opening
in
this
that
our
boat
is
borne
on
the
back
of
a
great
wave
and
we
come
into
a
strip
of
calmer
water
and
approach
the
single
these
stairs
are
not
so
convenient
as
those
of
the
vessel
we
have
just
left
and
two
persons
can
scarcely
pass
on
them
but
this
is
the
only
sea
entrance
to
jaffa
if
the
jews
attempt
to
return
and
enter
their
ancient
kingdom
this
way
it
will
take
them
a
long
time
to
get
in
a
fronts
the
town
fortified
by
a
couple
of
rusty
cannon
at
one
end
and
the
passage
is
through
the
one
gate
at
the
head
of
these
stairs
it
seems
forever
that
we
are
kept
waiting
at
the
foot
of
this
shaky
stairway
two
opposing
currents
are
struggling
to
get
up
and
down
it
excited
travellers
porters
with
trunks
and
knapsacks
and
dragomans
who
appear
to
be
pushing
their
way
through
simply
to
show
their
familiarity
with
the
country
it
is
a
dangerous
ascent
for
a
delicate
woman
somehow
as
we
wait
at
this
gate
where
so
many
men
of
note
have
waited
and
look
upon
this
upon
which
have
stood
so
many
of
the
mighty
from
solomon
to
origen
from
to
richard
cour
de
lion
the
historical
figure
which
most
pervades
jaffa
is
that
of
the
whimsical
jonah
whose
connection
with
it
was
the
slightest
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
ever
returned
here
josephus
who
takes
liberties
with
the
hebrew
scriptures
says
that
a
whale
carried
the
fugitive
into
the
euxine
sea
and
there
discharged
him
much
nearer
to
nineveh
than
he
would
have
been
if
he
had
kept
with
the
conveyance
in
which
he
first
took
passage
and
landed
at
tarsus
probably
no
one
in
jaffa
noticed
the
little
man
as
he
slipped
through
this
gate
and
took
ship
and
yet
his
simple
embarkation
from
the
town
has
given
it
more
notoriety
than
any
other
event
thanks
to
an
enduring
piece
of
literature
the
unheroic
jonah
and
his
whale
are
better
known
than
jerome
and
his
lion
they
are
the
earliest
associates
and
oriental
acquaintances
of
all
children
in
christendom
for
myself
i
confess
that
the
strictness
of
many
a
new
england
sunday
has
been
relieved
by
the
perusal
of
his
unique
adventure
he
in
a
manner
anticipated
the
use
of
the
monitors
and
other
submerged
when
we
have
struggled
up
the
slippery
stairs
and
come
through
the
gate
we
wind
about
for
some
time
in
a
narrow
passage
on
the
side
of
the
sea
and
then
cross
through
the
city
still
on
foot
it
is
a
rubbishy
place
the
streets
are
steep
and
crooked
we
pass
through
archways
we
ascend
steps
we
make
unexpected
turns
the
shops
are
a
little
like
bazaars
but
rather
italian
than
oriental
we
pass
a
pillared
mosque
and
a
moslem
fountain
we
come
upon
an
ancient
square
in
the
centre
of
which
is
a
round
fountain
with
pillars
and
a
canopy
of
stone
and
close
about
it
are
the
bazaars
of
merchants
this
old
fountain
is
profusely
sculptured
with
arabic
inscriptions
the
stones
are
worn
and
have
taken
the
rich
tint
of
age
and
the
sunlight
blends
it
into
harmony
with
the
gay
stuffs
of
the
shops
and
the
dark
skins
of
the
idlers
on
the
pavement
we
come
into
the
great
market
of
fruit
and
vegetables
where
vast
heaps
of
oranges
like
apples
in
a
new
england
orchard
line
the
way
and
fill
the
atmosphere
with
a
golden
tinge
the
jaffa
oranges
are
famous
in
the
orient
they
grow
to
the
size
of
ostrich
eggs
they
have
a
skin
as
thick
as
the
hide
of
a
rhinoceros
and
in
their
season
the
pulp
is
sweet
juicy
and
tender
it
is
a
little
late
now
and
we
open
one
golden
globe
after
another
before
we
find
one
that
is
not
dry
and
tasteless
as
a
piece
of
punk
but
one
can
not
resist
buying
such
magnificent
fruit
outside
the
walls
through
broad
dusty
highways
by
lanes
of
cactus
hedges
and
in
sight
again
of
the
sea
breaking
on
a
rocky
shore
we
come
to
the
hotel
of
the
twelve
tribes
occupied
now
principally
by
tribes
most
of
whom
appear
to
be
lost
in
the
adjacent
lot
are
pitched
the
tents
of
syrian
travellers
and
one
of
cook
expeditions
is
in
all
the
bustle
of
speedy
departure
the
bony
nervous
syrian
horses
are
assigned
by
lot
to
the
pilgrims
who
are
excellent
people
from
england
and
america
and
most
of
them
as
unaccustomed
to
the
back
of
a
horse
as
to
that
of
an
ostrich
it
is
touching
to
see
some
of
the
pilgrims
walk
around
the
animals
which
have
fallen
to
them
wondering
how
they
are
to
get
on
which
side
they
are
to
mount
and
how
they
are
to
stay
on
some
have
already
mounted
and
are
walking
the
steeds
carefully
round
the
enclosure
or
timidly
essaying
a
trot
nearly
every
one
concludes
after
a
trial
that
he
would
like
to
change
not
quite
so
much
up
and
down
you
know
an
easier
saddle
a
horse
that
more
unites
gentleness
with
spirit
some
of
the
dragomans
are
equipped
in
a
manner
to
impress
travellers
with
the
perils
of
the
country
one
whom
i
remember
on
the
nile
as
a
mild
though
showy
person
has
bloomed
here
into
a
bedawee
he
is
fierce
in
aspect
an
arsenal
of
weapons
and
gallops
furiously
about
upon
a
horse
loaded
down
with
accoutrements
this
however
is
only
the
beginning
of
our
real
danger
after
breakfast
we
sallied
out
to
see
the
sights
besides
the
house
of
simon
the
tanner
they
are
not
many
the
house
of
simon
is
as
it
was
in
the
time
of
peter
by
the
seaside
we
went
upon
the
roof
and
it
is
more
roof
than
anything
else
where
the
apostle
lay
down
to
sleep
and
saw
the
vision
and
looked
around
upon
the
other
roofs
and
upon
the
wide
sweep
of
the
tumbling
sea
in
the
court
is
a
well
the
stone
curb
of
which
is
deeply
worn
in
several
places
by
the
rope
showing
long
use
the
water
is
brackish
simon
may
have
tanned
with
it
the
house
has
not
probably
been
destroyed
and
rebuilt
more
than
four
or
five
times
since
peter
dwelt
here
the
romans
once
built
the
entire
city
the
chief
room
is
now
a
mosque
we
inquired
for
the
house
of
dorcas
but
that
is
not
shown
although
i
understood
that
we
could
see
her
grave
outside
the
city
it
is
a
great
oversight
not
to
show
the
house
of
dorcas
and
one
that
i
can
not
believe
will
long
annoy
pilgrims
in
these
days
of
multiplied
discoveries
of
sacred
sites
whether
this
is
the
actual
spot
where
the
house
of
simon
stood
i
do
not
know
nor
does
it
much
matter
here
or
hereabouts
the
apostle
saw
that
marvellous
vision
which
proclaimed
to
a
weary
world
the
brotherhood
of
man
from
this
spot
issued
the
gospel
of
democracy
a
truth
i
perceive
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
from
this
insignificant
dwelling
went
forth
the
edict
that
broke
the
power
of
tyrants
and
loosed
the
bonds
of
slaves
and
ennobled
the
lot
of
woman
and
enfranchised
the
human
mind
of
all
places
on
earth
i
think
there
is
only
one
more
worthy
of
pilgrimage
by
all
devout
and
souls
we
were
greatly
interested
also
in
a
visit
to
the
school
of
miss
amot
a
mission
school
for
girls
in
the
upper
chambers
of
a
house
in
the
most
crowded
part
of
jaffa
with
modest
courage
and
tact
and
this
lady
has
sustained
it
here
for
twelve
years
and
the
fruits
of
it
already
begin
to
appear
we
found
twenty
or
thirty
pupils
nearly
all
quite
young
and
most
of
them
daughters
of
christians
they
are
taught
in
arabic
the
common
branches
and
some
english
and
they
learn
to
sing
they
sang
for
us
english
tunes
like
any
sunday
school
a
strange
sound
in
a
moslem
town
there
are
one
or
two
other
schools
of
a
similar
character
in
the
orient
conducted
as
private
enterprises
by
ladies
of
culture
and
i
think
there
is
no
work
nobler
and
none
more
worthy
of
liberal
support
or
more
likely
to
result
in
giving
women
a
decent
position
in
eastern
society
on
a
little
elevation
a
outside
the
walls
is
a
cluster
of
wooden
houses
which
were
manufactured
in
america
there
we
found
the
remnants
of
the
adams
colony
only
half
a
dozen
families
out
of
the
original
two
hundred
and
fifty
persons
two
or
three
men
and
some
widows
and
children
the
colony
built
in
the
centre
of
their
settlement
an
ugly
little
church
out
of
maine
timber
it
now
stands
empty
and
staring
with
broken
windows
it
is
not
difficult
to
make
this
adventure
appear
romantic
those
who
engaged
in
it
were
plain
new
england
people
many
of
them
ignorant
but
devout
to
fanaticism
they
had
heard
the
prophets
expounded
and
the
prophecies
of
the
latter
days
unravelled
until
they
came
to
believe
that
the
day
of
the
lord
was
nigh
and
that
they
had
laid
upon
them
a
mission
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
divine
purposes
most
of
them
were
from
maine
and
new
hampshire
accustomed
to
bitter
winters
and
to
wring
their
living
from
a
niggardly
soil
i
do
not
wonder
that
they
were
fascinated
by
the
pictures
of
a
fair
land
of
blue
skies
a
land
of
vines
and
olives
and
palms
where
they
were
undoubtedly
called
by
the
spirit
to
a
life
of
greater
sanctity
and
considerable
ease
and
abundance
i
think
i
see
their
dismay
when
they
first
pitched
their
tents
amid
this
moslem
squalor
and
attempted
to
western
fashion
upon
the
skirts
of
the
plain
of
sharon
which
has
been
for
some
ages
they
erected
houses
however
and
joined
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
region
in
a
struggle
for
existence
but
adams
the
preacher
and
president
had
not
faith
enough
to
wait
for
the
unfolding
of
prophecy
he
took
to
strong
drink
and
with
general
bad
management
the
whole
enterprise
came
to
grief
and
the
deluded
people
were
rescued
from
starvation
only
by
the
liberality
of
our
government
there
was
the
germ
of
a
good
idea
in
the
rash
undertaking
if
palestine
is
ever
to
be
repeopled
its
coming
inhabitants
must
have
the
means
of
subsistence
and
if
those
now
here
are
to
be
redeemed
to
a
better
life
they
must
learn
to
work
before
all
else
there
must
come
a
revival
of
industry
and
a
development
of
the
resources
of
the
country
to
send
here
jews
or
gentiles
and
to
support
them
by
charity
only
adds
to
the
existing
misery
it
was
eight
years
ago
that
the
adams
community
exploded
its
heirs
and
successors
are
germans
a
colony
from
wurtemberg
an
advent
sect
akin
to
the
american
but
more
and
devout
they
own
the
ground
upon
which
they
have
settled
having
acquired
a
title
from
the
turkish
government
they
have
erected
substantial
houses
of
stone
and
a
large
hotel
the
jerusalem
and
give
many
evidences
of
shrewdness
and
thrift
as
well
as
piety
they
have
established
a
good
school
in
which
with
german
thoroughness
latin
english
and
the
higher
mathematics
are
taught
and
an
excellent
education
may
be
obtained
more
land
the
colony
is
not
permitted
to
own
but
they
hire
ground
outside
the
walls
which
they
farm
to
advantage
i
talked
with
one
of
the
teachers
a
thin
young
ascetic
in
spectacles
whose
severity
of
countenance
and
demeanor
was
sufficient
to
rebuke
all
the
oriental
levity
i
had
encountered
during
the
winter
there
was
in
him
and
in
the
other
leaders
an
air
of
sincere
fanaticism
and
a
sobriety
and
integrity
in
the
common
laborers
which
are
the
best
omens
for
the
success
of
the
colony
the
leaders
told
us
that
they
thought
the
americans
came
here
with
the
expectation
of
making
money
uppermost
in
mind
and
hardly
in
the
right
spirit
as
to
themselves
they
do
not
expect
to
make
money
they
repelled
the
insinuation
with
some
warmth
they
have
had
in
fact
a
very
hard
struggle
and
are
thankful
for
a
fair
measure
of
success
their
sole
present
purpose
is
evidently
to
redeem
and
reclaim
the
land
and
make
it
fit
for
the
expected
day
of
jubilee
the
jews
from
all
parts
of
the
world
they
say
are
to
return
to
palestine
and
there
is
to
issue
out
of
the
holy
land
a
new
divine
impulse
which
is
to
be
the
regeneration
and
salvation
of
the
world
i
do
not
know
that
anybody
but
the
jews
themselves
would
oppose
their
migration
to
palestine
though
their
withdrawal
from
the
business
of
the
world
suddenly
would
create
wide
disaster
with
these
doubts
however
we
did
not
trouble
the
youthful
knight
of
severity
we
only
asked
him
upon
what
the
community
founded
its
creed
and
its
mission
largely
he
replied
upon
the
prophets
and
especially
upon
isaiah
and
he
referred
us
to
isaiah
xxxii
xlix
et
seq
and
lii
it
is
not
every
industrial
community
that
would
flourish
on
a
charter
so
vague
as
this
a
lad
of
twelve
or
fourteen
was
our
guide
to
the
advent
settlement
he
was
an
early
polyglot
speaking
besides
english
french
and
german
arabic
and
i
think
a
little
greek
a
boy
of
uncommon
gravity
of
deportment
and
of
precocious
shrewdness
he
is
destined
to
be
a
guide
and
dragoman
i
could
see
that
the
whole
biblical
history
was
a
little
fade
to
him
but
he
does
not
lose
sight
of
the
profit
of
a
knowledge
of
it
i
could
not
but
contrast
him
with
a
scholar
of
his
own
age
in
america
whose
imagination
kindles
at
the
old
testament
stories
and
whose
enthusiasm
for
the
holy
land
is
awakened
by
the
wall
maps
and
the
pictures
of
solomon
temple
actual
contact
has
destroyed
the
imagination
of
this
boy
jerusalem
is
not
so
much
a
wonder
to
him
as
boston
samson
lived
just
over
there
beyond
the
plain
of
sharon
and
is
not
so
much
a
hero
as
old
put
the
boy
mother
was
a
good
new
hampshire
woman
whose
downright
yankeeism
of
thought
and
speech
was
in
odd
contrast
to
her
oriental
surroundings
i
sat
in
a
in
the
of
her
little
wood
cottage
and
could
scarcely
convince
myself
that
i
was
not
in
a
prim
new
hampshire
parlor
to
her
mind
there
were
no
more
oriental
illusions
and
perhaps
she
had
never
indulged
any
certainly
in
her
presence
palestine
seemed
to
me
as
commonplace
as
new
england
you
seen
the
meetin
house
it
goin
to
rack
and
ruin
like
everything
else
here
there
is
enough
here
to
have
any
service
now
sometimes
i
go
to
the
german
i
try
to
keep
up
a
little
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
more
difficult
to
keep
up
a
religious
feeling
in
the
holy
land
than
it
is
in
new
hampshire
but
we
did
not
discuss
that
point
i
asked
you
have
any
society
little
the
germans
are
dreffle
unsocial
the
natives
are
all
a
low
set
the
arabs
will
all
lie
i
do
think
much
of
any
of
the
mohammedans
are
all
shiftless
you
ca
trust
any
of
do
you
go
home
sometimes
i
think
i
like
to
see
the
old
place
but
i
reckon
i
could
stand
the
winters
this
is
a
nice
climate
all
there
is
here
and
we
have
grapes
and
oranges
and
loads
of
flowers
see
my
garden
there
i
set
great
store
by
that
and
me
and
my
daughter
take
solid
comfort
in
it
especially
when
he
is
away
and
he
has
to
be
off
most
of
the
time
with
parties
guidin
no
i
guess
i
ever
cross
the
ocean
it
appeared
that
the
good
woman
had
consoled
herself
with
a
second
husband
who
bears
a
jewish
name
so
that
the
original
object
of
her
mission
to
gather
in
the
chosen
people
is
not
altogether
lost
sight
of
there
is
a
curious
interest
in
these
new
england
transplantations
climate
is
a
great
transformer
the
habits
and
customs
of
thousands
of
years
will
insensibly
conquer
the
most
stubborn
prejudices
i
wonder
how
long
it
will
require
to
blend
these
scions
of
our
vigorous
civilization
with
the
motley
growth
that
makes
up
the
present
syriac
population
whose
blood
is
streaked
with
a
dozen
different
strains
egyptian
ethiopian
arabian
assyrian
phoenician
greek
roman
canaanite
jewish
persian
turkish
with
all
the
races
that
have
in
turn
ravaged
or
occupied
the
land
i
do
not
indeed
presume
to
say
what
the
syrians
are
who
have
occupied
palestine
for
so
many
hundreds
of
years
but
i
can
not
see
how
it
can
be
otherwise
than
that
their
blood
is
as
mixed
as
that
of
the
modern
egyptians
perhaps
these
new
england
offshoots
will
maintain
their
distinction
of
race
for
a
long
time
but
i
should
be
still
more
interested
to
know
how
long
the
new
england
mind
will
keep
its
integrity
in
these
surroundings
and
whether
those
ruggednesses
of
virtue
and
those
homely
simplicities
of
character
which
we
recognize
as
belonging
to
the
hilly
portions
of
new
england
will
insensibly
melt
away
in
this
relaxing
air
that
so
much
wants
moral
tone
these
oriental
countries
have
been
conquered
many
times
but
they
have
always
conquered
their
conquerors
i
am
told
that
even
our
american
consuls
are
not
always
more
successful
in
resisting
the
undermining
seductions
of
the
east
than
were
the
roman
proconsuls
these
reflections
however
let
it
be
confessed
did
not
come
to
me
as
i
sat
in
the
of
my
countrywoman
i
was
rather
thinking
how
completely
her
presence
and
accent
dispelled
all
my
oriental
illusions
and
cheapened
the
associations
of
jaffa
there
is
i
know
not
what
in
a
real
living
yankee
that
puts
all
appearances
to
the
test
and
dissipates
the
colors
of
romance
it
was
not
until
i
came
again
into
the
highway
and
found
in
front
of
the
jerusalem
hotel
a
company
of
arab
acrobats
and
their
swarthy
bodies
shining
in
the
white
sunlight
and
a
lot
of
idlers
squatting
about
in
enjoyment
of
the
exertions
of
others
that
i
recovered
in
any
degree
my
delusions
with
the
return
of
these
it
seemed
not
so
impossible
to
believe
even
in
the
return
of
the
jews
especially
when
we
learned
that
preparations
for
them
multiply
a
second
german
colony
has
been
established
outside
of
the
city
there
is
another
at
haifa
on
the
jerusalem
road
the
beginning
of
one
has
been
made
by
the
jews
themselves
it
amounts
to
something
like
a
at
three
in
the
afternoon
we
set
out
for
ramleh
ignominiously
in
a
wagon
there
is
a
from
jaffa
to
jerusalem
and
our
dragoman
had
promised
us
a
we
decided
to
take
it
thinking
it
would
be
more
comfortable
than
horseback
for
some
of
our
party
we
made
a
mistake
which
we
have
never
ceased
to
regret
the
road
i
can
confidently
commend
as
the
worst
in
the
world
the
carriage
into
which
we
climbed
belonged
to
the
german
colony
and
was
a
compromise
between
the
ancient
ark
a
modern
dray
and
a
it
was
one
of
those
contrivances
that
a
german
would
evolve
out
of
his
inner
consciousness
and
its
appearance
here
gave
me
grave
doubts
as
to
the
adaptability
of
these
honest
germans
to
the
orient
it
was
however
a
great
deal
worse
than
it
looked
if
it
were
driven
over
smooth
ground
it
would
soon
loosen
all
the
teeth
of
the
passengers
and
shatter
their
spinal
columns
but
over
the
jerusalem
road
the
effect
was
indescribable
the
noise
of
it
was
intolerable
the
jolting
incredible
the
little
solid
dutchman
who
sat
in
front
and
drove
shook
like
the
charioteer
of
an
artillery
wagon
but
i
suppose
he
had
no
feeling
we
pounded
along
over
the
roughest
stone
pavement
with
the
sensation
of
victims
drawn
to
execution
in
a
cart
until
we
emerged
into
the
open
country
but
there
we
found
no
improvement
in
the
road
jaffa
is
surrounded
by
immense
orange
groves
which
are
protected
along
the
highways
by
hedges
of
we
came
out
from
a
lane
of
these
upon
the
level
and
blooming
plain
of
sharon
and
saw
before
us
on
the
left
the
blue
hills
of
judæa
it
makes
little
difference
what
kind
of
conveyance
one
has
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
advance
upon
this
historic
if
not
sacred
plain
and
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
those
pale
hills
which
stood
to
him
for
a
celestial
vision
in
his
childhood
without
a
great
quickening
of
the
pulse
and
it
is
a
most
lovely
view
after
egypt
or
after
anything
the
elements
of
it
are
simple
enough
a
wide
sweep
of
prairie
and
a
line
of
graceful
mountains
but
the
forms
are
pleasing
and
the
color
is
incomparable
the
soil
is
warm
and
red
the
fields
are
a
mass
of
of
the
most
brilliant
and
variegated
hues
and
alternately
swept
by
the
shadows
of
clouds
and
bathed
in
the
sun
the
scene
takes
on
the
animation
of
incessant
change
it
was
somewhere
here
outside
the
walls
i
do
not
know
the
spot
that
the
massacre
of
jaffa
occurred
i
purposely
go
out
of
my
way
to
repeat
the
story
of
it
and
i
trust
that
it
will
always
be
recalled
whenever
any
mention
is
made
of
the
cruel
little
corsican
who
so
long
imposed
the
vulgarity
and
savageness
of
his
selfish
nature
upon
europe
it
was
in
march
that
napoleon
toward
the
close
of
his
humiliating
and
disastrous
campaign
in
egypt
carried
jaffa
by
storm
the
town
was
given
over
to
pillage
during
its
progress
four
thousand
albanians
of
the
garrison
taking
refuge
in
some
old
khans
offered
to
surrender
on
condition
that
their
lives
should
be
spared
otherwise
they
would
fight
to
the
bitter
end
their
terms
were
accepted
and
two
of
napoleon
pledged
their
honor
for
their
safety
they
were
marched
out
to
the
general
headquarters
and
seated
in
front
of
the
tents
with
their
arms
bound
behind
them
the
displeased
commander
called
a
council
of
war
and
deliberated
two
days
upon
their
fate
and
then
signed
the
order
for
the
massacre
of
the
entire
body
the
excuse
was
that
the
general
could
not
be
burdened
with
so
many
prisoners
thus
in
one
day
were
murdered
in
cold
blood
about
as
many
people
as
jaffa
at
present
contains
its
inhabitants
may
be
said
to
have
been
accustomed
to
being
massacred
eight
thousand
of
them
were
butchered
in
one
roman
assault
but
i
suppose
all
antiquity
may
be
searched
in
vain
for
an
act
of
perfidy
and
cruelty
combined
equal
to
that
of
the
grand
emperor
the
road
over
which
we
rattle
is
a
causeway
of
loose
stones
the
country
is
a
plain
of
sand
but
clothed
with
a
luxuriant
vegetation
in
the
fields
the
brown
husbandmen
are
plowing
turning
up
the
soft
red
earth
with
a
rude
plough
drawn
by
cattle
yoked
wide
apart
storks
on
their
way
i
suppose
from
egypt
to
their
summer
residence
further
north
dot
the
meadows
and
are
too
busy
picking
up
worms
to
notice
our
halloo
who
has
a
passion
for
shooting
begs
permission
to
these
household
birds
with
the
gun
but
we
explain
to
him
that
we
would
no
more
shoot
a
stork
than
one
of
the
green
birds
of
paradise
quails
are
scudding
about
in
the
newly
turned
furrows
and
song
birds
salute
us
from
the
tops
of
swinging
cypresses
the
holy
land
is
rejoicing
in
its
one
season
of
beauty
its
trees
are
not
wanting
to
the
verdant
meadows
we
still
encounter
an
occasional
grove
of
oranges
olives
also
appear
and
acacias
sycamores
cypresses
and
tamarisks
the
pods
of
the
are
i
believe
the
husks
upon
which
the
prodigal
son
did
not
thrive
large
patches
of
barley
are
passed
but
the
fields
not
occupied
with
grain
are
literally
carpeted
with
of
the
most
brilliant
hues
such
a
display
as
i
never
saw
elsewhere
scarlet
and
dark
flaming
poppies
the
scarlet
anemone
marigolds
white
daisies
the
lobelia
the
lupin
the
vetch
the
gorse
with
its
delicate
yellow
blossom
the
pea
something
that
we
agreed
to
call
the
white
rose
of
sharon
the
mallow
the
asphodel
the
leaves
of
a
lily
not
yet
in
bloom
about
the
rose
of
sharon
we
no
doubt
were
mistaken
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
it
was
white
but
we
have
somehow
associated
the
purity
of
that
color
with
the
song
beginning
am
the
rose
of
sharon
and
the
lily
of
the
it
was
probably
not
even
a
rose
we
finally
decided
to
cherish
the
red
mallow
as
the
rose
of
sharon
it
is
very
abundant
and
the
botanist
of
our
company
seemed
satisfied
to
accept
it
for
myself
the
rose
by
the
name
of
mallow
does
not
smell
sweet
we
come
in
sight
of
rainleh
which
lies
on
the
swelling
mounds
of
the
green
plain
encompassed
by
emerald
meadows
and
by
groves
of
orange
and
olive
and
conspicuous
from
a
great
distance
by
its
elegant
square
tower
the
most
beautiful
in
form
that
we
have
seen
in
the
east
as
the
sun
is
sinking
we
defer
our
visit
to
it
and
drive
to
the
latin
convent
where
we
are
to
lodge
permission
to
that
effect
having
been
obtained
from
the
sister
convent
at
jaffa
a
mere
form
since
a
part
of
the
convent
was
built
expressly
for
the
entertainment
of
travellers
and
the
few
monks
who
occupy
it
find
keeping
a
hotel
a
very
profitable
kind
of
hospitality
the
stranger
is
the
guest
of
the
superior
no
charge
is
made
and
the
little
fiction
of
gratuitous
hospitality
so
pleases
the
pilgrim
that
he
will
not
at
his
departure
be
outdone
in
liberality
it
would
be
much
more
agreeable
if
all
our
hotels
were
upon
this
system
while
the
dragoman
is
unpacking
the
luggage
in
the
and
bustling
about
in
a
manner
to
impress
the
establishment
with
the
importance
of
its
accession
i
climb
up
to
the
roofs
to
get
the
sunset
the
house
is
all
roofs
it
would
seem
at
different
levels
steps
lead
here
and
there
and
one
can
wander
about
at
will
you
could
not
desire
a
pleasanter
in
a
summer
evening
the
protecting
walls
which
are
are
built
in
with
cylinders
of
tile
like
the
mud
houses
in
egypt
the
tiles
make
the
walls
lighter
and
furnish
at
the
same
time
through
which
the
monks
can
spy
the
world
themselves
unseen
i
noticed
that
the
tiles
about
the
entrance
court
were
inclined
downwards
so
that
a
curious
person
could
study
any
new
arrival
at
the
convent
without
being
himself
observed
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
square
tower
which
is
called
saracenic
and
is
entirely
gothic
in
spirit
and
the
light
lay
soft
and
rosy
on
the
wide
compass
of
green
vegetation
i
heard
on
the
distant
fields
the
bells
of
mules
returning
to
the
gates
and
the
sound
substituted
italy
in
my
mind
for
palestine
from
this
prospect
i
was
summoned
in
haste
the
superior
of
the
convent
was
waiting
to
receive
me
and
i
had
been
sought
in
all
directions
i
had
no
idea
why
i
should
be
received
but
i
soon
found
that
the
occasion
was
not
a
trivial
one
in
the
were
seated
in
some
state
the
superior
attended
by
two
or
three
brothers
and
the
remainder
of
my
suite
already
assembled
the
abbot
if
he
is
an
abbot
arose
and
cordially
welcomed
to
his
humble
establishment
hoped
that
he
was
not
fatigued
by
the
journey
from
jaffa
and
gave
him
a
seat
beside
himself
the
remainder
of
the
party
were
ranged
according
to
their
rank
i
replied
that
the
journey
was
on
the
contrary
delightful
and
that
any
journey
could
be
considered
fortunate
which
had
the
hospitable
convent
of
ramleh
as
its
end
the
courteous
monk
renewed
his
solicitous
inquiries
and
my
astonishment
was
increased
by
the
botanist
who
gravely
assured
the
worthy
father
that
was
accustomed
to
fatigue
and
that
such
a
journey
as
this
was
a
recreation
to
him
in
the
mischief
is
all
this
about
i
seized
a
moment
to
whisper
to
the
person
next
me
are
a
distinguished
american
general
travelling
with
his
lady
in
pursuit
of
heaven
knows
what
and
accompanied
by
his
suite
do
make
a
mess
of
i
said
i
am
a
distinguished
american
general
travelling
with
my
lady
in
pursuit
of
heaven
knows
what
i
am
glad
to
know
fortunately
the
peaceful
father
did
not
know
anything
more
of
war
than
i
did
and
i
suppose
my
hastily
assumed
modesty
of
the
soldier
seemed
to
him
the
real
thing
it
was
my
first
experience
of
anything
like
real
war
the
first
time
i
had
ever
occupied
any
military
position
and
it
did
not
seem
to
be
so
arduous
as
has
been
represented
great
regret
was
expressed
by
the
superior
that
they
had
not
anticipated
my
arrival
in
order
to
have
entertained
me
in
a
more
worthy
manner
the
convent
was
uncommonly
full
of
pilgrims
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
lodge
my
suite
as
it
deserved
then
there
followed
a
long
discussion
between
the
father
and
one
of
the
monks
upon
our
disposition
for
the
night
we
give
the
general
and
his
lady
the
south
room
in
the
court
then
the
etc
urged
the
monk
the
general
and
his
lady
occupy
the
cell
number
four
then
mademoiselle
can
etc
the
military
commander
and
his
lady
were
at
last
shown
into
a
cell
opening
out
of
the
court
a
lofty
but
narrow
vaulted
room
with
brick
floor
and
thick
walls
and
one
small
window
near
the
ceiling
instead
of
candles
we
had
antique
roman
lamps
which
made
a
feeble
glimmer
in
the
cavern
the
oddest
served
for
pitchers
it
may
not
have
been
damp
but
it
felt
as
if
no
sun
had
ever
penetrated
the
chill
interior
is
all
this
nonsense
of
the
general
i
asked
as
soon
as
i
could
get
hold
of
that
managing
factotum
be
sure
these
monk
always
pay
more
attention
to
what
did
you
say
at
the
convent
in
jaffa
when
you
applied
for
a
permit
to
lodge
here
i
tell
him
my
gentleman
general
american
but
mebbe
he
done
gone
wrote
that
you
american
general
very
nice
man
the
superior
speak
italian
beautiful
when
i
give
him
the
letter
he
say
he
do
all
he
can
for
the
general
and
his
suite
he
sorry
i
not
let
him
know
the
dinner
was
served
in
the
long
refectory
and
there
were
some
persons
at
table
mostly
pilgrims
to
jerusalem
and
most
of
them
of
the
poorer
class
one
bright
italian
had
travelled
alone
with
her
little
boy
all
the
way
from
verona
only
to
see
the
holy
sepulchre
the
monks
waited
at
table
and
served
a
very
good
dinner
travellers
are
not
permitted
to
enter
the
portion
of
the
large
convent
which
contains
the
cells
of
the
monks
nor
to
visit
any
part
of
the
old
building
except
the
chapel
i
fancied
that
the
jolly
brothers
who
waited
at
table
were
rather
glad
to
come
into
contact
with
the
world
even
in
this
capacity
in
the
hangs
a
notable
picture
it
is
the
virgin
enthroned
with
a
crown
and
aureole
holding
the
holy
child
who
is
also
crowned
in
the
foreground
is
a
choir
of
white
boys
or
angels
the
virgin
and
child
are
both
black
it
is
the
virgin
of
ethiopia
i
could
not
learn
the
origin
of
this
picture
it
was
rude
enough
in
execution
to
be
the
work
of
a
greek
artist
of
the
present
day
but
it
was
said
to
come
from
ethiopia
where
it
is
necessary
to
a
proper
respect
for
the
virgin
that
she
should
be
represented
black
she
seems
to
bear
something
the
relation
to
the
virgin
of
judæa
that
astarte
did
to
the
grecian
venus
and
we
are
again
reminded
that
the
east
has
no
prejudice
of
color
am
black
but
comely
o
ye
daughters
of
not
upon
me
because
i
am
black
because
the
sun
hath
looked
upon
the
convent
bells
are
ringing
at
early
dawn
and
though
we
are
up
at
half
past
five
nearly
all
the
pilgrims
have
hastily
departed
for
jerusalem
upon
the
roof
i
find
the
morning
fair
there
are
more
minarets
than
spires
in
sight
but
they
stand
together
in
this
pretty
little
town
without
discord
the
bells
are
ringing
in
melodious
persuasion
but
at
the
same
time
in
voices
as
musical
the
muezzins
are
calling
from
their
galleries
each
summoning
men
to
prayer
in
its
own
way
from
these
walls
spectators
once
looked
down
upon
the
battles
of
cross
and
crescent
raging
in
the
lovely
meadows
of
quite
as
much
pride
as
piety
a
common
interest
always
softens
animosity
and
i
fancy
that
monks
and
moslems
will
not
again
resort
to
the
foolish
practice
of
breaking
each
other
heads
so
long
as
they
enjoy
the
profitable
stream
of
pilgrims
to
the
holy
land
after
breakfast
and
a
gift
to
the
treasury
of
the
convent
according
to
our
think
if
i
were
to
stay
there
again
it
would
be
in
the
character
of
a
common
embarked
again
in
the
ark
and
jolted
along
behind
the
driver
who
seemed
to
enjoy
the
rattling
and
rumbling
of
his
clumsy
vehicle
but
no
minor
infelicity
could
destroy
for
us
the
freshness
of
the
morning
or
the
enjoyment
of
the
lovely
country
although
in
the
jolting
one
could
not
utter
a
remark
about
the
beauty
of
the
way
without
danger
of
biting
his
tongue
in
two
we
feasted
our
eyes
and
let
our
imaginations
loose
over
the
vast
ranges
of
the
old
testament
story
after
passing
through
the
fertile
meadows
of
ramleh
we
came
into
a
more
rolling
country
destitute
of
houses
but
clothed
on
with
a
most
brilliant
bloom
of
among
which
the
papilionaceous
flowers
were
conspicuous
for
color
and
delicacy
i
found
by
the
roadside
a
black
calla
which
i
should
no
more
have
believed
in
than
in
the
black
virgin
if
i
had
not
seen
it
its
leaf
is
exactly
that
of
our
its
flower
is
similar
to
but
not
so
open
and
flaring
as
the
white
calla
and
the
pistil
is
large
and
very
long
and
of
the
color
of
the
interior
of
the
flower
the
corolla
is
green
on
the
outside
but
the
inside
is
incomparably
rich
like
velvet
black
in
some
lights
and
dark
maroon
in
others
nothing
could
be
finer
in
color
and
texture
than
this
superb
flower
besides
the
blooms
of
yesterday
we
noticed
buttercups
various
sorts
of
the
ranunculus
among
them
the
scarlet
and
the
a
light
purple
flower
with
a
dark
purple
centre
the
star
of
bethlehem
and
the
purple
scarlet
poppies
and
the
still
more
brilliant
scarlet
anemones
dandelions
marguerites
filled
all
the
fields
with
masses
of
color
shortly
we
come
into
the
hills
through
which
the
road
winds
upward
and
the
scenery
is
very
much
like
that
of
the
adirondacks
or
would
be
if
the
rocky
hills
of
the
latter
were
denuded
of
trees
the
way
begins
to
be
lively
with
passengers
and
it
becomes
us
to
be
circumspect
for
almost
every
foot
of
ground
has
been
consecrated
or
desecrated
or
in
some
manner
made
memorable
this
heap
of
rubbish
is
the
remains
of
a
fortress
which
the
saracens
captured
built
by
the
crusaders
to
guard
the
entrance
of
the
pass
upon
the
site
of
an
older
fortification
by
the
maccabees
or
founded
upon
roman
substructions
and
mentioned
in
judges
as
the
spot
where
some
very
ancient
jew
stayed
overnight
it
is
also
no
doubt
one
of
the
stations
that
help
us
to
determine
with
the
accuracy
of
a
surveyor
the
boundary
between
the
territory
of
benjamin
and
judah
i
try
to
ascertain
all
these
localities
and
to
remember
them
all
but
i
sometimes
get
richard
cour
de
lion
mixed
with
jonathan
maccabæus
and
i
have
no
doubt
i
mistook
for
the
castellum
boni
latronis
a
place
we
were
specially
desirous
to
see
as
the
birthplace
of
the
but
whatever
we
confounded
we
are
certain
of
one
thing
we
looked
over
into
the
valley
of
ajalon
it
was
over
this
valley
that
joshua
commanded
the
moon
to
tarry
while
he
smote
the
fugitive
amorites
on
the
heights
of
gibeon
there
to
the
east
the
road
is
thronged
with
pilgrims
to
jerusalem
and
with
travellers
and
their
attendants
cavalcades
scattered
all
along
the
winding
way
over
the
rolling
plain
as
in
the
picture
of
the
pilgrims
to
canterbury
all
the
transport
of
freight
as
well
as
passengers
is
by
the
backs
of
beasts
of
burden
there
are
long
files
of
horses
and
mules
staggering
under
enormous
loads
of
trunks
tents
and
bags
dragomans
some
of
them
got
up
in
fierce
style
with
baggy
yellow
trousers
yellow
kuffias
bound
about
the
head
with
a
twisted
fillet
armed
with
long
damascus
swords
their
belts
stuck
full
of
pistols
and
a
rifle
slung
on
the
back
gallop
furiously
along
the
line
the
signs
of
danger
but
the
assurances
of
protection
camp
boys
and
waiters
dash
along
also
on
the
with
a
great
clatter
of
kitchen
furniture
even
a
scullion
has
an
air
of
adventure
as
he
pounds
his
steed
into
a
vicious
gallop
and
there
are
the
cook
tourists
called
by
everybody
men
and
women
struggling
on
according
to
the
pace
of
their
horses
conspicuous
in
hats
with
white
muslin
drapery
hanging
over
the
neck
fellows
with
or
without
long
guns
coming
and
going
on
the
highway
have
the
air
of
being
neither
pilgrims
nor
strangers
we
meet
women
returning
from
jerusalem
clad
in
white
seated
astride
their
horses
or
upon
beds
which
top
their
multifarious
baggage
we
are
leaving
behind
us
on
the
right
the
country
of
samson
in
which
he
passed
his
playful
and
engaging
boyhood
and
we
look
wistfully
towards
it
of
zorah
where
he
was
born
nothing
is
left
but
a
cistern
and
there
is
only
a
wretched
hamlet
to
mark
the
site
of
timnath
where
he
got
his
philistine
wife
her
for
me
for
she
pleaseth
me
well
was
his
only
reply
to
the
entreaty
of
his
father
that
he
would
be
content
with
a
maid
of
his
own
people
the
country
gets
wilder
and
more
rocky
as
we
ascend
down
the
ragged
side
paths
come
wretched
women
and
girls
staggering
under
the
loads
of
brushwood
which
they
have
cut
in
the
high
ravines
loads
borne
upon
the
head
that
would
tax
the
strength
of
a
strong
man
i
found
it
no
easy
task
to
lift
one
of
the
bundles
the
poor
creatures
were
scantily
clad
in
a
single
garment
of
coarse
brown
cloth
but
most
of
them
wore
a
profusion
of
ornaments
strings
of
coins
turkish
and
arabic
on
the
head
and
breast
and
uncouth
rings
and
bracelets
farther
on
a
rabble
of
boys
besets
us
begging
for
backsheesh
in
piteous
and
whining
tones
and
throwing
up
their
arms
in
theatrical
gestures
of
despair
all
the
hills
bear
marks
of
having
once
been
terraced
to
the
very
tops
for
vines
and
olives
the
natural
ledges
seem
to
have
been
humored
into
terraces
and
occasionally
built
up
and
broadened
by
stone
walls
but
where
the
hill
was
smooth
traces
of
terraces
are
yet
visible
the
grape
is
still
cultivated
low
down
the
steeps
and
the
olives
straggle
over
some
of
the
hills
to
the
very
top
but
these
feeble
efforts
of
culture
or
of
nature
do
little
to
relieve
the
deserted
aspect
of
the
scene
we
lunch
in
a
pretty
olive
grove
upon
a
slope
long
ago
terraced
and
now
and
lovely
vistas
open
into
cool
glades
and
paths
lead
upward
among
the
rocks
to
inviting
retreats
from
this
high
perch
in
the
bosom
of
the
hills
we
look
off
upon
ramleh
jaffa
the
broad
plain
of
sharon
and
the
sea
a
strip
of
sand
between
the
sea
and
the
plain
produces
the
effect
of
a
mirage
giving
to
the
plain
the
appearance
of
the
sea
it
would
be
a
charming
spot
for
a
for
a
resident
of
jerusalem
although
jerusalem
itself
is
rural
enough
at
present
and
david
and
solomon
may
have
had
summer
pavilions
in
these
cool
shades
in
sight
of
the
mediterranean
david
himself
however
perhaps
had
enough
of
this
he
dodged
about
in
these
fastnesses
between
ramah
and
gath
from
the
pursuit
of
make
him
content
with
a
city
life
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
our
believing
that
he
often
enjoyed
this
prospect
and
we
do
believe
it
for
it
is
already
evident
that
the
imagination
must
be
called
in
to
create
an
enjoyment
of
this
deserted
land
david
no
doubt
loved
this
spot
for
david
was
a
poet
even
at
this
early
period
when
his
occupation
was
that
of
a
successful
guerilla
and
he
had
all
the
true
poet
adaptability
as
witness
the
exquisite
ode
he
composed
on
the
death
of
his
enemy
saul
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
enjoyed
this
lovely
prospect
often
for
he
was
a
man
who
enjoyed
heartily
everything
lovely
he
was
in
this
as
in
all
he
did
a
thorough
man
when
he
made
a
raid
on
an
amorite
city
he
left
neither
man
woman
nor
child
alive
to
spread
the
news
we
have
already
mounted
over
two
thousand
feet
the
rocks
are
silicious
limestone
crumbling
and
gray
with
ages
of
exposure
they
give
the
landscape
an
ashy
appearance
but
there
is
always
a
little
verdure
amid
the
rocks
and
now
and
then
an
perhaps
a
very
old
one
decrepit
and
twisted
into
the
most
fantastic
form
as
if
distorted
by
a
vegetable
rheumatism
casting
abroad
its
withered
arms
as
if
the
tree
writhed
in
pain
on
such
ghostly
trees
i
have
no
doubt
the
five
kings
were
hanged
another
tree
or
rather
shrub
is
abundant
the
and
the
hawthorn
now
in
blossom
is
frequently
seen
the
delicate
white
single
by
the
wayside
and
amid
the
ledges
and
the
scarlet
anemone
flames
out
more
brilliantly
than
ever
nothing
indeed
could
be
more
beautiful
than
the
contrast
of
the
clusters
of
scarlet
anemones
and
white
roses
with
the
gray
rocks
we
soon
descend
into
a
valley
and
reach
the
site
of
which
has
not
much
ancient
interest
for
me
except
that
the
name
is
pleasing
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
stream
and
opposite
a
moslem
fountain
are
the
gloomy
stone
habitations
of
the
family
of
the
terrible
abu
ghaush
whose
robberies
of
travellers
kept
the
whole
country
in
a
panic
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
he
held
the
key
of
this
pass
and
let
no
one
go
by
without
toll
for
fifty
years
he
and
his
companions
defied
the
turkish
government
and
even
went
to
the
extremity
of
murdering
two
pashas
who
attempted
to
pass
this
way
he
was
disposed
of
in
but
his
descendants
still
live
here
having
the
inclination
but
not
the
courage
of
the
old
chief
we
did
not
encounter
any
of
them
but
i
have
never
seen
any
buildings
that
have
such
a
wicked
physiognomy
as
their
grim
houses
near
by
is
the
ruin
of
a
low
chapel
of
a
pure
gothic
style
a
remnant
of
the
crusaders
occupation
the
gloomy
wady
has
another
association
a
monkish
tradition
would
have
us
believe
it
was
the
birthplace
of
jeremiah
if
the
prophet
was
born
in
such
a
hard
country
it
might
account
for
his
lamentations
as
we
pass
out
of
this
wady
the
german
driver
points
to
a
forlorn
village
clinging
to
the
rocky
slope
of
a
hill
to
the
right
and
says
is
where
john
baptist
was
the
information
is
sudden
and
seems
improbable
especially
as
there
are
other
places
where
he
was
born
do
you
know
we
ask
i
know
ganz
wohl
i
been
five
years
in
dis
land
and
i
ought
to
descending
into
a
deep
ravine
we
cross
a
brook
which
we
are
told
is
the
one
that
flows
into
the
valley
of
elah
the
valley
of
the
or
button
trees
and
if
so
it
is
the
brook
out
of
which
david
took
the
stone
that
killed
goliath
it
is
a
bright
dashing
stream
i
stood
upon
the
bridge
watching
it
dancing
down
the
ravine
and
should
have
none
but
agreeable
recollections
of
it
but
that
close
to
the
bridge
stood
a
vile
and
in
the
doorway
sat
the
most
man
i
ever
saw
in
judæa
rapacity
and
murder
in
his
eyes
the
present
generation
have
much
more
to
fear
from
him
and
his
drugged
liquors
than
the
israelite
had
from
the
giant
of
gath
while
the
wagon
zigzags
up
the
last
long
hill
i
mount
by
a
short
path
and
come
upon
a
rocky
plateau
across
which
runs
a
broad
way
on
the
bed
rock
worn
smooth
by
many
centuries
of
travel
by
the
passing
of
caravans
and
armies
to
jerusalem
of
innumerable
generations
of
peasants
of
chariots
of
horses
mules
and
here
went
the
messengers
of
the
king
pleasure
and
here
came
the
heralds
and
legates
of
foreign
nations
this
great
highway
the
kings
and
prophets
themselves
must
have
trodden
when
they
journeyed
towards
the
sea
for
ï
can
not
learn
that
the
jews
ever
had
any
decent
roads
and
perhaps
they
never
attained
the
civilization
necessary
to
build
them
we
have
certainly
seen
no
traces
of
anything
like
a
practicable
ancient
highway
on
this
route
indeed
the
greatest
wonder
to
me
in
the
whole
east
is
that
there
has
not
been
a
good
road
built
from
jaffa
to
jerusalem
that
the
city
sacred
to
more
than
half
the
world
to
all
the
most
powerful
nations
to
moslems
jews
greeks
roman
catholics
protestants
the
desire
of
all
lands
and
the
object
of
pilgrimage
with
the
delicate
and
the
feeble
as
well
as
the
strong
should
not
have
a
highway
to
it
over
which
one
can
ride
without
being
jarred
and
stunned
and
pounded
to
a
jelly
that
the
jews
should
never
have
made
a
road
to
their
seaport
that
the
romans
the
do
not
seem
to
have
constructed
one
over
this
important
route
the
sultan
began
this
one
over
which
we
have
been
dragged
for
the
empress
eugenie
but
he
did
not
finish
it
most
of
the
way
it
is
a
mere
rubble
of
stones
the
track
is
well
engineered
and
the
road
bed
is
well
enough
soft
stone
is
at
hand
to
form
an
excellent
dressing
and
it
might
be
in
a
short
time
as
good
a
highway
as
any
in
switzerland
if
the
sultan
would
set
some
of
his
lazy
subjects
to
work
out
their
taxes
on
it
of
course
it
is
now
a
great
improvement
over
the
old
path
for
mules
but
as
a
carriage
road
it
is
atrocious
imagine
miles
of
cobble
pavement
with
every
other
stone
gone
and
the
remainder
sharpened
perhaps
however
it
is
best
not
to
have
a
decent
road
to
the
holy
city
of
the
world
it
would
make
going
there
easy
even
for
delicate
ladies
and
invalid
clergymen
it
would
reduce
the
cost
of
the
trip
from
jaffa
by
two
thirds
it
would
take
away
employment
from
a
lot
of
vagabonds
who
harry
the
traveller
over
the
route
it
would
make
the
pilgrimage
too
much
a
luxury
in
these
days
of
pilgrimages
by
rail
and
of
little
faith
or
rather
of
a
sort
of
lacquer
of
faith
which
is
only
credulity
upon
this
plateau
we
begin
to
discern
signs
of
the
neighborhood
of
the
city
and
we
press
forward
with
the
utmost
eagerness
disappointed
at
every
turn
that
a
sight
of
it
is
not
disclosed
scattered
settlements
extend
for
some
distance
out
on
the
jaffa
road
we
pass
a
school
which
the
germans
have
established
for
arab
boys
an
institution
which
does
not
meet
the
approval
of
our
restoration
driver
the
boys
when
they
come
out
he
says
do
know
what
they
are
they
are
neither
moslems
nor
christians
we
go
rapidly
on
over
the
swelling
hill
but
the
city
will
not
reveal
itself
we
expect
it
any
moment
to
rise
up
before
us
conspicuous
on
its
ancient
hills
its
walls
shining
in
the
sun
we
pass
a
some
towers
and
newly
built
private
residences
our
pulses
are
beating
a
hundred
to
the
minute
but
the
city
refuses
to
upon
us
as
it
does
upon
other
travellers
we
have
advanced
far
enough
to
see
that
there
is
no
elevation
before
us
higher
than
that
we
are
on
the
great
sight
of
all
our
lives
is
only
a
moment
separated
from
us
in
a
few
rods
more
our
hearts
will
be
satisfied
by
that
prospect
how
many
millions
of
pilgrims
have
hurried
along
this
road
lifting
up
their
eyes
in
impatience
for
the
vision
but
it
does
not
come
suddenly
we
have
already
seen
it
when
the
driver
stops
points
with
his
whip
and
cries
that
we
are
above
it
and
nearly
upon
it
what
we
see
is
chiefly
this
the
domes
and
long
buildings
of
the
russian
hospice
on
higher
ground
than
the
city
and
concealing
a
good
part
of
it
a
large
number
of
new
houses
built
of
limestone
prettily
streaked
with
the
red
oxyde
of
iron
the
roofs
of
a
few
of
the
city
houses
and
a
little
portion
of
the
wall
that
overlooks
the
valley
of
hinnom
the
remainder
of
the
city
of
david
is
visible
to
the
imagination
the
suburb
through
which
we
pass
can
not
be
called
pleasing
everything
outside
the
walls
looks
new
and
naked
the
whitish
glare
of
the
stone
is
relieved
by
little
vegetation
and
the
effect
is
that
of
barrenness
as
we
drive
down
along
the
wall
of
the
russian
convent
we
begin
to
meet
pilgrims
and
strangers
with
whom
the
city
overflows
at
this
season
many
russian
peasants
unkempt
unsavory
fellows
with
long
hair
and
dirty
apparel
but
most
of
them
wearing
a
pelisse
trimmed
with
fur
and
a
huge
fur
hat
there
are
and
all
sorts
of
cheap
booths
and
shanty
shops
along
the
highway
the
crowd
is
motley
and
far
from
pleasant
it
is
sordid
grimy
hard
very
different
from
the
more
homogeneous
easy
flowing
graceful
and
picturesque
assemblage
of
vagabonds
at
the
gate
of
an
egyptian
town
there
are
russians
cossacks
georgians
jews
armenians
syrians
the
northern
dirt
and
squalor
and
fanaticism
do
not
come
gracefully
into
the
orient
besides
the
rabble
is
importunate
and
impudent
we
enter
by
the
jaffa
and
hebron
gate
a
big
square
tower
with
the
exterior
entrance
to
the
north
and
the
interior
to
the
east
and
the
short
turn
is
choked
with
camels
and
horses
and
a
clamorous
crowd
beside
it
stands
the
ruinous
citadel
of
saladin
and
the
tower
of
david
a
noble
entrance
to
a
mean
street
through
the
rush
of
footmen
and
horsemen
beggars
venders
of
moslems
jews
and
greeks
we
make
our
way
to
the
mediterranean
hotel
a
rambling
new
hostelry
in
passing
to
our
rooms
we
pause
a
moment
upon
an
open
balcony
to
look
down
into
the
green
pool
of
hezekiah
and
off
over
the
roofs
to
the
mount
of
olives
having
secured
our
rooms
i
hasten
along
narrow
and
abominably
cobbled
streets
mere
ditches
of
stone
lined
with
mean
shops
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
it
was
in
obedience
to
a
natural
but
probably
mistaken
impulse
that
i
went
straight
to
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
during
my
first
hour
in
the
city
perhaps
it
was
a
mistake
to
go
there
at
all
certainly
i
should
have
waited
until
i
had
become
more
accustomed
to
holy
places
when
a
person
enters
this
memorable
church
as
i
did
expecting
to
see
only
two
sacred
sites
and
is
brought
immediately
face
to
face
with
his
mind
is
staggered
and
his
credulity
becomes
so
enfeebled
that
it
is
practically
useless
to
him
thereafter
in
any
part
of
the
holy
city
and
this
is
a
pity
for
it
is
so
much
easier
and
sweeter
to
believe
than
to
doubt
it
would
have
been
better
also
to
have
visited
jerusalem
many
years
ago
then
there
were
fewer
sacred
sites
invented
and
scholarly
investigation
had
not
so
sharply
questioned
the
authenticity
of
the
few
but
i
thought
of
none
of
these
things
as
i
stumbled
along
the
narrow
and
filthy
streets
which
are
stony
channels
of
mud
and
water
rather
than
and
peeped
into
the
dirty
little
shops
that
line
the
way
i
thought
only
that
i
was
in
jerusalem
and
it
was
impossible
at
first
for
its
near
appearance
to
empty
the
name
of
its
tremendous
associations
or
to
drive
out
the
image
of
that
holy
city
with
i
had
seen
the
dome
of
the
church
from
the
hotel
balcony
the
building
itself
is
so
hemmed
in
by
houses
that
only
its
south
side
in
which
is
the
sole
entrance
can
be
seen
from
the
street
in
front
of
this
entrance
is
a
small
square
the
descent
to
this
square
is
by
a
flight
of
steps
down
palmer
street
a
lane
given
up
to
the
traffic
in
beads
and
the
thousand
trinkets
most
of
them
cheap
and
inartistic
which
absorb
the
industry
of
the
holy
city
the
little
square
itself
surrounded
by
ancient
buildings
on
three
sides
and
by
the
blackened
walls
of
the
church
on
the
north
might
be
set
down
in
a
mediæval
italian
town
without
incongruity
and
at
the
hour
i
first
saw
it
you
would
have
said
that
a
market
or
fair
was
in
progress
there
this
however
i
found
was
its
normal
condition
it
is
always
occupied
by
a
horde
of
more
clamorous
and
impudent
merchants
than
you
will
find
in
any
other
place
in
the
orient
it
is
with
some
difficulty
that
the
pilgrim
can
get
through
the
throng
and
approach
the
portal
the
pavement
is
covered
with
heaps
of
beads
shells
and
every
species
of
holy
by
which
are
seated
the
traders
men
and
women
in
wait
for
customers
the
moment
i
stopped
to
look
at
the
church
and
it
was
discovered
that
i
was
a
a
rush
was
made
at
me
from
every
part
of
the
square
and
i
was
at
once
the
centre
of
the
most
eager
and
hungry
crowd
greeks
impudent
jews
women
from
bethlehem
sleek
armenians
thrust
strings
of
rude
olive
beads
and
crosses
into
my
face
forced
upon
my
notice
trumpery
carving
in
ivory
in
nuts
in
seeds
and
screamed
prices
and
entreaties
in
chorus
bidding
against
each
other
and
holding
fast
to
me
as
if
i
were
the
last
man
and
this
were
the
last
opportunity
they
would
ever
have
of
getting
rid
of
their
rubbish
handfuls
of
beads
rapidly
fell
from
five
francs
to
half
a
franc
and
the
dealers
insisted
upon
my
buying
with
a
threatening
air
i
remember
one
and
rapacious
wretch
who
danced
about
and
clung
to
me
and
looked
into
my
eyes
with
an
expression
that
said
plainly
you
do
buy
these
beads
i
murder
my
recollection
is
that
i
bought
for
i
never
can
resist
a
persuasion
of
this
sort
whenever
i
saw
the
fellow
in
the
square
afterwards
i
always
fancied
that
he
regarded
me
with
a
sort
of
contempt
but
he
made
no
further
attempt
on
my
life
this
is
the
sort
of
preparation
that
one
daily
has
in
approaching
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
the
greed
and
noise
of
traffic
around
it
are
as
fatal
to
sentiment
as
they
are
to
devotion
you
may
be
amused
one
day
you
may
be
indignant
the
next
at
last
you
will
be
weary
of
the
importunate
crowd
and
the
only
consolation
you
can
get
from
these
daily
scenes
of
the
desecration
of
the
temple
of
pilgrimage
is
the
proof
they
afford
that
this
is
indeed
jerusalem
and
that
these
are
the
legitimate
descendants
of
the
thieves
whom
christ
scourged
from
the
precincts
of
the
temple
alas
that
they
should
thrive
under
the
new
dispensation
as
they
did
under
the
old
a
considerable
part
of
the
present
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
is
not
more
than
sixty
years
old
but
the
massive
carved
and
dark
south
portal
and
the
remains
of
the
old
towers
and
walls
on
this
side
may
be
eight
hundred
there
has
been
some
sort
of
a
church
here
ever
since
the
time
of
constantine
that
is
three
centuries
after
the
crucifixion
of
our
lord
which
has
marked
the
spot
that
was
then
determined
to
be
the
site
of
the
holy
sepulchre
many
a
time
the
buildings
have
been
swept
away
by
fire
or
by
the
fanaticism
of
enemies
but
they
have
as
often
been
renewed
there
would
seem
at
first
to
have
been
a
cluster
of
buildings
here
each
of
which
arose
to
cover
a
newly
discovered
sacred
site
happily
all
the
sacred
places
are
now
included
within
the
walls
of
this
heterogeneous
mass
of
chapels
shrines
tombs
and
altars
of
worship
of
many
warring
sects
called
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
happily
also
the
exhaustive
discussion
of
the
question
of
the
true
site
of
the
sepulchre
conducted
by
the
most
devout
and
accomplished
biblical
scholars
and
the
keenest
antiquarians
of
the
age
relieves
the
ordinary
tourist
from
any
obligation
to
enter
upon
an
investigation
that
would
interest
none
but
those
who
have
been
upon
the
spot
no
doubt
the
larger
portion
of
the
christian
world
accepts
this
site
as
the
true
one
i
make
with
diffidence
a
suggestion
that
struck
me
although
it
may
not
be
new
the
pool
of
hezekiah
is
not
over
four
hundred
feet
measured
on
the
map
from
the
dome
of
the
sepulchre
under
the
church
itself
are
several
large
excavations
in
the
rocks
which
were
once
cisterns
ancient
jerusalem
depended
for
its
water
upon
these
cisterns
which
took
the
drainage
from
the
roofs
and
upon
a
few
pools
like
that
of
hezekiah
which
were
fed
from
other
reservoirs
such
as
pool
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
city
these
cisterns
under
the
church
may
not
date
back
to
the
time
of
our
lord
but
if
they
do
they
were
doubtless
at
that
time
within
the
walls
and
of
course
the
pool
of
hezekiah
so
near
to
this
alleged
site
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
been
beyond
the
walls
within
the
door
of
the
church
upon
a
raised
divan
at
one
side
as
if
this
were
a
bazaar
and
he
were
the
merchant
sat
a
fat
turk
in
official
dress
the
sneering
warden
of
this
christian
edifice
and
the
perhaps
necessary
guardian
of
peace
within
his
presence
there
however
is
at
first
a
disagreeable
surprise
to
all
those
who
rebel
at
owing
an
approach
to
the
holy
place
to
the
toleration
of
a
moslem
but
i
was
quite
relieved
of
any
sense
of
obligation
when
upon
coming
out
the
turk
asked
me
for
backsheesh
whatever
one
may
think
as
to
the
site
of
calvary
no
one
can
approach
a
spot
which
even
claims
to
be
it
and
which
has
been
for
centuries
the
object
of
worship
of
millions
and
is
constantly
thronged
by
believing
pilgrims
without
profound
emotion
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
i
entered
the
church
and
already
the
shades
of
evening
increased
the
artificial
gloom
of
the
interior
at
the
very
entrance
lies
an
object
that
arrests
one
it
is
a
long
marble
slab
resting
upon
the
pavement
about
which
candles
are
burning
every
devout
pilgrim
who
comes
in
kneels
and
kisses
it
and
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
see
it
for
the
crowds
who
press
about
it
underneath
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
stone
of
unction
upon
which
the
lord
body
was
laid
according
to
the
jewish
fashion
for
anointing
after
he
was
taken
from
the
cross
i
turned
directly
into
the
rotunda
under
the
dome
of
which
is
the
stone
building
enclosing
the
holy
sepulchre
a
ruder
structure
than
that
which
covers
the
hut
and
tomb
of
francis
in
the
church
at
assisi
i
met
in
the
way
a
procession
of
latin
monks
bearing
candles
and
chanting
as
they
walked
they
were
making
the
round
of
the
holy
places
in
the
church
this
being
their
hour
for
the
tour
the
sects
have
agreed
upon
certain
hours
for
these
little
daily
pilgrimages
so
that
there
shall
be
no
collision
a
rabble
of
pilgrims
followed
the
monks
they
had
just
come
from
incensing
and
adoring
the
sepulchre
and
the
crowd
of
other
pilgrims
who
had
been
waiting
their
turn
were
now
pressing
in
at
the
narrow
door
as
many
times
as
i
have
been
there
i
have
always
seen
pilgrims
struggling
to
get
in
and
struggling
to
get
out
the
proud
and
the
humble
crowd
there
together
the
greasy
boor
from
beyond
the
volga
jostles
my
lady
from
naples
and
the
dainty
pilgrim
from
america
pushes
her
way
through
a
throng
of
stout
armenian
peasants
but
i
have
never
seen
any
disorder
there
nor
any
rudeness
except
the
thoughtless
eagerness
of
zeal
taking
my
chance
in
the
line
i
passed
into
the
first
apartment
called
the
chapel
of
the
angel
a
narrow
and
gloomy
antechamber
which
takes
its
name
from
the
fragment
of
stone
in
the
centre
the
stone
upon
which
the
angel
sat
after
it
had
been
rolled
away
from
the
sepulchre
a
stream
of
light
came
through
the
low
and
narrow
door
of
the
tomb
through
the
passage
to
this
vault
only
one
person
can
enter
at
a
time
and
the
tomb
will
hold
no
more
than
three
or
four
stooping
along
the
passage
which
is
cased
with
marble
like
the
tomb
and
may
cover
natural
rock
i
came
into
the
sacred
place
and
into
a
blaze
of
silver
lamps
and
candles
the
vault
is
not
more
than
six
feet
by
seven
and
is
covered
by
a
low
dome
the
sepulchral
stone
occupies
all
the
right
side
and
is
the
object
of
devotion
it
is
of
marble
supposed
to
cover
natural
stone
and
is
cracked
and
worn
smooth
on
the
edge
by
the
kisses
of
millions
of
people
the
attendant
who
stood
at
one
end
opened
a
little
in
which
were
kept
and
let
me
see
the
naked
rock
which
is
said
to
be
that
of
the
tomb
while
i
stood
there
in
that
very
centre
of
the
faith
and
longing
of
so
many
souls
which
seemed
almost
to
palpitate
with
a
consciousness
of
its
awful
position
pilgrim
after
pilgrim
on
bended
knees
entered
the
narrow
way
kissed
with
fervor
or
with
coldness
the
unresponsive
marble
and
withdrew
in
the
same
attitude
some
approached
it
with
streaming
eyes
and
kissed
it
with
trembling
rapture
some
ladies
threw
themselves
upon
the
cold
stone
and
sobbed
aloud
indeed
i
did
not
of
my
own
will
intrude
upon
these
acts
of
devotion
which
have
the
right
of
secrecy
but
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
escape
so
completely
was
the
entrance
blocked
up
when
i
had
struggled
out
i
heard
chanting
from
the
hill
of
golgotha
and
saw
the
gleaming
of
a
hundred
lights
from
chapel
and
tomb
and
remote
recesses
but
i
cared
to
see
no
more
of
the
temple
itself
that
day
the
next
morning
it
was
the
of
april
was
very
cold
and
the
day
continued
so
without
the
air
was
keen
and
within
it
was
nearly
impossible
to
get
warm
or
keep
so
in
the
houses
which
had
gathered
the
damp
and
chill
of
dungeons
you
might
suppose
that
the
dirtiest
and
most
beggarly
city
in
the
world
could
not
be
much
deteriorated
by
the
weather
but
it
is
in
a
cheerful
sunny
day
you
find
that
the
desolation
of
jerusalem
has
a
certain
charm
and
attraction
even
a
tattered
jew
leaning
against
a
ruined
wall
or
a
beggar
on
a
dunghill
is
picturesque
in
the
sunshine
but
if
you
put
a
day
of
chill
rain
and
frosty
wind
into
the
city
none
of
the
elements
of
complete
misery
are
wanting
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
day
or
night
indeed
there
is
nothing
ever
to
be
done
in
the
evening
except
to
read
your
is
the
go
to
bed
you
are
obliged
to
act
like
a
christian
here
whatever
you
are
speaking
of
the
weather
a
word
about
the
time
for
visiting
syria
may
not
be
amiss
in
the
last
part
of
march
the
snow
was
a
foot
deep
in
the
streets
parties
who
had
started
on
their
tour
northward
were
snowed
in
and
forced
to
hide
in
their
tents
three
days
from
the
howling
winter
there
is
pleasure
for
you
we
found
friends
in
the
city
who
had
been
waiting
two
weeks
after
they
had
exhausted
its
sights
for
settled
weather
that
would
permit
them
to
travel
northward
to
be
sure
the
inhabitants
say
that
this
last
storm
ought
to
have
been
rain
instead
of
snow
according
to
the
habit
of
the
seasons
and
it
no
doubt
would
have
been
if
this
region
were
not
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
the
hardships
of
the
syrian
tour
are
enough
in
the
best
weather
and
i
am
convinced
that
our
dragoman
is
right
in
saying
that
most
travellers
begin
it
too
early
in
the
spring
jerusalem
is
not
a
formidable
city
to
the
explorer
who
is
content
to
remain
above
ground
and
is
not
too
curious
about
its
substructions
and
buried
walls
and
has
no
taste
as
some
have
for
crawling
through
its
drains
i
suppose
it
would
elucidate
the
history
of
the
jews
if
we
could
dig
all
this
hill
away
and
lay
bare
all
the
old
foundations
and
ascertain
exactly
how
the
city
was
watered
i
for
one
am
grateful
to
the
excellent
man
and
great
scholar
who
crawled
on
his
hands
and
knees
through
a
subterranean
conduit
and
established
the
fact
of
a
connection
between
the
fountain
of
the
virgin
and
the
pool
of
siloam
but
i
would
rather
contribute
money
to
establish
a
school
for
girls
in
the
holy
city
than
to
aid
in
laying
bare
all
the
aqueducts
from
ophel
to
the
tower
of
david
but
this
is
probably
because
i
do
not
enough
appreciate
the
importance
of
such
researches
among
jewish
remains
to
the
progress
of
christian
truth
and
morality
in
the
world
the
discoveries
hitherto
made
have
done
much
to
clear
up
the
topography
of
ancient
jerusalem
i
do
not
know
that
they
have
yielded
anything
valuable
to
art
or
to
philology
any
treasures
illustrating
the
habits
the
social
life
the
culture
or
the
religion
of
the
past
such
as
are
revealed
beneath
the
soil
of
rome
or
in
the
ashes
of
pompeii
it
is
however
true
that
almost
every
tourist
in
jerusalem
becomes
speedily
involved
in
all
these
questions
of
ancient
sites
identification
of
valleys
that
once
existed
of
walls
that
are
now
sunk
under
the
accumulated
rubbish
of
two
thousand
years
from
thirty
feet
to
ninety
feet
deep
and
of
foundations
that
are
rough
enough
and
massive
enough
to
have
been
laid
by
david
and
cemented
by
solomon
and
the
fascination
of
the
pursuit
would
soon
send
one
underground
with
a
pickaxe
and
a
shovel
but
of
all
the
diggings
i
saw
in
the
holy
city
that
which
interested
me
most
was
the
excavation
of
the
church
and
hospital
of
the
chivalric
knights
of
john
concerning
which
i
shall
say
a
word
further
on
the
present
walls
were
built
by
sultan
suleiman
in
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
upon
foundations
much
older
and
here
and
there
as
you
can
see
upon
big
blocks
of
jewish
workmanship
the
wall
is
high
enough
and
very
picturesque
in
its
zigzag
course
and
angles
and
i
suppose
strong
enough
to
hitch
a
horse
to
but
would
make
short
work
of
it
having
said
thus
much
of
the
topography
gratuitously
and
probably
unnecessarily
for
every
one
is
supposed
to
know
jerusalem
as
well
as
he
knows
his
native
town
we
are
free
to
look
at
anything
that
may
chance
to
interest
us
i
do
not
expect
however
that
any
words
of
mine
can
convey
to
the
reader
a
just
conception
of
the
sterile
and
blasted
character
of
this
promontory
and
the
country
round
about
it
or
of
the
squalor
shabbiness
and
unpicturesqueness
of
the
city
always
excepting
a
few
of
its
buildings
and
some
fragments
of
antiquity
built
into
modern
structures
here
and
there
and
it
is
difficult
to
feel
that
this
spot
was
ever
the
splendid
capital
of
a
powerful
state
that
this
arid
and
stricken
country
could
ever
have
supplied
the
necessities
of
such
a
capital
and
above
all
that
so
many
jews
could
ever
have
been
crowded
within
this
cramped
space
as
josephus
says
perished
in
the
siege
by
titus
when
thousand
were
carried
into
captivity
and
eleven
hundred
thousand
died
by
famine
and
the
sword
almost
the
entire
jewish
nation
must
have
been
packed
within
this
small
area
our
first
walk
through
the
city
was
in
the
via
dolorosa
as
gloomy
a
thoroughfare
as
its
name
implies
its
historical
portion
is
that
steep
and
often
angled
part
between
the
holy
sepulchre
and
the
house
of
pilate
but
we
traversed
the
whole
length
of
it
to
make
our
exit
from
stephen
gate
toward
the
mount
of
olives
it
is
only
about
four
hundred
years
ago
that
this
street
obtained
the
name
of
the
via
dolorosa
and
that
the
sacred
on
it
were
marked
out
for
the
benefit
of
the
pilgrim
it
is
a
narrow
lane
steep
in
places
having
frequent
sharp
angles
running
under
arches
and
passing
between
gloomy
buildings
enlivened
by
few
shops
along
this
way
christ
passed
from
the
judgment
hall
of
pilate
to
calvary
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
the
houses
along
it
have
been
destroyed
and
rebuilt
since
their
conflagration
by
titus
but
this
destruction
is
no
obstacle
to
the
existence
intact
of
all
that
are
necessary
to
illustrate
the
of
our
lord
in
this
street
i
saw
the
house
of
simon
the
cyrenian
who
bore
the
cross
after
jesus
i
saw
the
house
of
veronica
from
which
that
woman
stepped
forth
and
gave
jesus
a
handkerchief
to
wipe
his
brow
handkerchief
with
the
features
imprinted
on
it
which
we
have
all
seen
exhibited
at
peter
in
rome
and
i
looked
for
the
house
of
the
wandering
jew
or
at
least
for
the
spot
where
he
stood
when
he
received
that
awful
mandate
of
fleshly
immortality
in
this
street
are
recognized
the
several
that
christ
made
in
bearing
the
cross
we
were
shown
the
places
where
he
fell
a
stone
having
the
impress
of
his
hand
a
pillar
broken
by
his
fall
and
also
the
stone
upon
which
mary
sat
when
he
passed
by
nothing
is
wanting
that
the
narrative
requires
we
saw
also
in
this
street
the
house
of
dives
and
the
stone
on
which
lazarus
sat
while
the
dogs
ministered
unto
him
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
must
be
in
a
dream
in
thus
beholding
the
houses
and
places
of
resort
of
the
characters
in
a
parable
and
i
carried
my
dilemma
to
a
catholic
friend
but
a
learned
father
assured
him
that
there
was
no
doubt
that
this
is
the
house
of
dives
for
christ
often
took
his
parables
from
real
life
after
that
i
went
again
to
look
at
the
stone
in
a
corner
of
a
building
amid
a
heap
of
refuse
upon
which
the
beggar
sat
and
to
admire
the
pretty
stone
tracery
of
the
windows
in
the
house
of
dives
at
the
end
of
the
street
in
a
new
latin
nunnery
are
the
remains
of
the
house
of
pilate
which
are
supposed
to
be
authentic
the
present
establishment
is
called
the
convent
of
anne
and
the
community
is
very
fortunate
at
this
late
day
in
obtaining
such
a
historic
site
for
itself
we
had
the
privilege
of
seeing
here
some
of
the
original
rock
that
formed
part
of
the
foundations
of
pilate
house
and
there
are
three
stones
built
into
the
altar
that
were
taken
from
the
pavement
of
gabbatha
upon
which
christ
walked
these
are
recent
discoveries
it
appears
probable
that
the
real
pavement
of
gabbatha
has
been
found
since
pilate
house
is
so
satisfactorily
identified
spanning
the
street
in
front
of
this
convent
is
the
ecce
homo
arch
upon
which
pilate
showed
christ
to
the
populace
the
ground
of
the
new
building
was
until
recently
in
possession
of
the
moslems
who
would
not
sell
it
for
a
less
price
than
seventy
thousand
francs
the
arch
they
would
not
sell
at
all
and
there
now
dwells
in
a
small
chamber
on
top
of
it
a
moslem
saint
and
hermit
the
world
of
pilgrims
flows
under
his
feet
he
looks
from
his
window
upon
a
daily
procession
of
christians
who
traverse
the
via
dolorosa
having
first
signified
their
submission
to
the
moslem
yoke
in
the
holy
city
by
passing
under
this
arch
of
humiliation
the
hermit
however
has
the
grace
not
to
show
himself
and
few
know
that
he
sits
there
in
the
holy
occupation
of
letting
his
hair
and
his
nails
grow
from
the
house
of
the
roman
procurator
we
went
to
the
citadel
of
sultan
suleiman
this
stands
close
by
the
jaffa
gate
and
is
the
most
picturesque
object
in
all
the
circuit
of
the
walls
and
although
the
citadel
is
of
modern
origin
its
most
characteristic
portion
lays
claim
to
great
antiquity
the
massive
structure
which
impresses
all
strangers
who
enter
by
the
jaffa
gate
is
called
the
tower
of
hippicus
and
also
the
tower
of
david
it
is
identified
as
the
tower
which
herod
built
and
josephus
describes
and
there
is
as
little
doubt
that
its
foundations
are
the
same
that
david
laid
and
solomon
strengthened
there
are
no
such
stones
in
any
other
part
of
the
walls
as
these
enormous
bevelled
blocks
they
surpass
those
in
the
harem
wall
at
what
is
called
the
wailing
place
the
tower
stands
upon
the
northwest
corner
of
the
old
wall
of
zion
and
being
the
point
most
open
to
attack
it
was
most
strongly
built
it
seems
also
to
have
been
connected
with
the
palace
on
zion
which
david
built
for
it
is
the
tradition
that
it
was
from
this
tower
that
the
king
first
saw
bathsheba
the
wife
of
uriah
when
came
to
pass
in
an
eventide
that
david
arose
from
off
his
bed
and
walked
upon
the
roof
of
the
king
house
and
from
the
roof
he
saw
a
woman
washing
herself
and
the
woman
was
very
beautiful
to
look
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
gate
we
now
look
down
upon
the
pool
of
bathsheba
in
which
there
is
no
water
and
we
are
informed
that
it
was
by
that
pool
that
the
lovely
woman
who
was
destined
to
be
the
mother
of
solomon
sat
when
the
king
took
his
evening
walk
others
say
that
she
sat
by
the
pool
of
gibon
it
does
not
matter
the
subject
was
a
very
fruitful
one
for
the
artists
of
the
renaissance
who
delighted
in
a
glowing
reproduction
of
the
biblical
stories
and
found
in
such
incidents
as
this
and
the
confusion
of
susanna
themes
in
which
the
morality
of
the
age
could
express
itself
without
any
conflict
with
the
religion
of
the
age
it
is
a
comment
not
so
much
upon
the
character
of
david
as
upon
the
morality
of
the
time
in
which
he
lived
that
although
he
repented
and
no
doubt
sincerely
of
his
sin
when
reproved
for
it
his
repentance
did
not
take
the
direction
of
he
did
not
send
away
bathsheba
this
square
old
tower
is
interiorly
so
much
in
ruins
that
it
is
not
easy
to
climb
to
its
parapet
and
yet
it
still
has
a
guardhouse
attached
to
it
and
is
kept
like
a
fortification
a
few
rusty
old
cannon
under
the
charge
of
the
soldiers
would
injure
only
those
who
attempted
to
fire
them
the
entire
premises
have
a
turkish
aspect
the
view
from
the
top
is
the
best
in
the
city
of
the
city
itself
we
saw
also
from
it
the
hills
of
moab
and
a
bit
of
the
dead
sea
close
by
is
the
armenian
quarter
covering
a
large
part
of
what
was
once
the
hill
of
zion
i
wish
it
were
the
christian
quarter
for
it
is
the
only
part
of
the
town
that
makes
any
pretension
to
cleanliness
and
it
has
more
than
any
other
the
aspect
of
an
abode
of
peace
and
charity
this
is
owing
to
its
being
under
the
government
of
one
corporation
for
the
armenian
convent
covers
nearly
the
entire
space
of
this
extensive
quarter
the
convent
is
a
singular
irregular
mass
of
houses
courts
and
streets
the
latter
apparently
running
over
and
under
and
through
the
houses
you
come
unexpectedly
upon
stairways
you
traverse
roofs
you
enter
rooms
and
houses
on
the
roofs
of
other
houses
and
it
is
difficult
to
say
at
any
time
whether
you
are
on
the
earth
or
in
the
air
the
convent
at
this
season
is
filled
with
pilgrims
over
three
thousand
of
whom
i
was
told
were
lodged
here
we
came
upon
families
of
them
in
the
little
rooms
in
the
courts
and
corridors
or
upon
the
roofs
pursuing
their
domestic
avocations
as
if
they
were
at
home
cooking
mending
sleeping
a
boorish
but
lot
of
peasants
the
church
is
a
large
and
very
interesting
specimen
of
religious
architecture
and
splendid
barbaric
decoration
in
the
vestibule
hang
the
these
are
long
planks
of
a
sonorous
wood
which
give
forth
a
ringing
sound
when
struck
with
a
club
as
they
are
of
different
sizes
you
get
some
variation
of
tone
and
they
can
be
heard
far
enough
to
call
the
inmates
of
the
convent
to
worship
the
interior
walls
are
lined
with
ancient
blue
tiles
to
a
considerable
height
and
above
them
are
rude
and
inartistic
sacred
pictures
there
is
in
the
church
much
curious
inlaid
work
of
and
especially
about
the
doors
of
the
chapels
and
one
side
shines
with
the
pearl
as
if
it
were
encrusted
with
silver
ostrich
eggs
are
strung
about
in
profusion
with
hooks
attached
for
hanging
lamps
the
first
day
of
our
visit
to
this
church
in
one
of
the
doorways
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
side
chapel
and
which
was
thickly
encrusted
with
stood
the
venerable
bishop
in
a
light
robe
and
a
pointed
hood
with
a
cross
in
his
hand
preaching
to
the
pilgrims
who
knelt
on
the
pavement
before
him
talking
in
a
familiar
manner
and
our
guide
said
with
great
plainness
of
speech
the
armenian
clergy
are
celebrated
for
the
splendor
of
their
vestments
and
i
could
not
but
think
that
this
bishop
in
his
shining
framework
must
seem
like
a
being
of
another
sphere
to
the
boors
before
him
he
almost
imposed
upon
us
these
pilgrims
appeared
to
be
of
the
poorest
agricultural
class
of
laborers
and
their
costume
is
uncouth
beyond
description
in
a
side
chapel
where
we
saw
tiles
on
the
walls
that
excited
our
envy
quaintest
figures
and
illustrations
of
sacred
subjects
clerks
were
taking
the
names
of
pilgrims
just
arrived
who
kneeled
before
them
and
paid
a
napoleon
each
for
their
lodging
in
the
convent
as
long
as
they
should
choose
to
stay
in
this
chapel
were
the
shoes
of
the
pilgrims
who
had
gone
into
the
church
a
motley
collection
of
covering
half
the
floor
leather
and
straw
square
shoes
as
broad
as
long
round
shoes
pointed
shoes
old
shoes
patched
shoes
shoes
with
the
toes
gone
a
pathetic
gathering
that
told
of
poverty
and
weary
big
feet
these
shoes
were
things
to
muse
on
for
each
pair
made
maybe
in
a
different
century
seemed
to
have
a
character
of
its
own
as
it
stood
there
awaiting
the
owner
people
often
make
reflections
upon
a
pair
of
shoes
literature
is
full
of
them
poets
have
celebrated
many
a
pretty
shoe
queen
slipper
it
may
be
or
the
hobnail
brogan
of
a
peasant
or
oftener
the
tiny
shoes
of
a
child
but
it
is
seldom
that
one
has
an
opportunity
for
such
comprehensive
moralizing
as
was
here
given
if
we
ever
regretted
the
lack
of
a
poet
in
our
party
it
was
now
we
walked
along
the
armenian
walls
past
the
lepers
quarter
and
outside
the
walls
through
the
gate
of
zion
or
the
gate
of
the
prophet
david
as
it
is
also
called
and
came
upon
a
continuation
of
the
plateau
of
the
hill
of
zion
which
is
now
covered
with
cemeteries
and
is
the
site
of
the
house
of
caiaphas
and
of
the
tomb
of
david
and
those
kings
of
jerusalem
who
were
considered
by
the
people
worthy
of
sepulture
here
for
the
jews
seem
to
have
brought
from
egypt
the
notion
of
refusing
royal
burial
to
their
bad
kings
and
they
had
very
few
respectable
ones
the
house
of
caiaphas
the
had
suffered
a
recent
and
was
in
such
a
state
of
ruin
that
we
could
with
difficulty
enter
it
or
recognize
any
likeness
of
a
house
on
the
premises
is
an
armenian
chapel
in
it
we
were
shown
the
prison
in
which
christ
was
confined
also
the
stone
door
of
the
sepulchre
which
the
latins
say
the
armenians
stole
but
the
most
remarkable
object
here
is
the
little
marble
column
having
carved
on
it
a
figure
of
christ
bound
to
a
pillar
upon
which
the
cock
stood
and
crowed
when
peter
denied
his
lord
there
are
some
difficulties
in
the
way
of
believing
this
now
but
they
will
lessen
as
the
column
gets
age
outside
this
gate
lie
the
desolate
fields
strewn
with
the
brown
tombstones
of
the
greeks
and
armenians
a
melancholy
spectacle
each
sect
has
its
own
cemetery
and
the
dead
sleep
peaceably
enough
but
the
living
who
bury
them
frequently
quarrel
i
saw
one
day
a
funeral
procession
halted
outside
the
walls
for
some
reason
the
greek
priest
had
refused
the
dead
burial
in
the
grave
dug
for
him
in
the
cemetery
the
bier
was
dumped
on
the
slope
beside
the
road
and
half
overturned
the
friends
were
sitting
on
the
ground
wrangling
the
man
had
been
dead
three
days
and
the
coffin
had
been
by
the
roadside
in
this
place
since
the
day
before
this
was
in
the
morning
towards
night
i
saw
the
same
crowd
there
but
a
turkish
official
appeared
and
ordered
the
greeks
to
bury
their
dead
somewhere
and
that
without
delay
to
bury
it
for
the
sake
of
the
public
health
and
quarrel
about
the
grave
afterwards
if
they
must
a
crowd
collected
joining
with
fiery
gesticulation
and
clamor
in
the
dispute
the
shrill
voices
of
women
being
heard
above
all
but
at
last
four
men
roughly
shouldered
the
box
handling
it
as
if
it
contained
merchandise
and
trotted
off
with
it
as
we
walked
over
this
pathless
barren
necropolis
strewn
as
it
were
with
shapeless
broken
and
leaning
headstones
it
was
impossible
to
connect
with
it
any
sentiment
of
affection
or
piety
it
spoke
like
everything
else
about
here
of
mortality
and
seemed
only
a
part
of
that
historical
jerusalem
which
is
dead
and
buried
in
which
no
living
person
can
have
anything
more
than
an
archaeological
interest
it
was
then
with
something
like
a
shock
that
we
heard
demetrius
our
guide
say
pointing
to
a
rude
stone
is
the
grave
of
my
mother
demetrius
was
a
handsome
greek
boy
of
a
beautiful
type
which
has
almost
disappeared
from
greece
itself
and
as
clever
a
lad
as
ever
spoke
all
languages
and
accepted
all
religions
without
yielding
too
much
to
any
one
he
had
been
well
educated
in
the
english
school
and
his
education
had
failed
to
put
any
faith
in
place
of
the
superstition
it
had
destroyed
the
boy
seemed
to
be
numerously
if
not
well
connected
in
the
city
he
was
always
exchanging
a
glance
and
a
smile
with
some
pretty
greek
girl
whom
we
met
in
the
way
and
when
i
said
who
was
that
he
always
answered
is
my
the
boy
was
so
intelligent
so
vivacious
and
full
of
the
spirit
of
adventure
me
a
dozen
times
a
day
to
take
him
with
me
anywhere
in
the
world
so
modern
that
he
had
not
till
this
moment
seemed
to
belong
to
jerusalem
nor
to
have
any
part
in
its
decay
this
chance
discovery
of
his
intimate
relation
to
this
necropolis
gave
if
i
may
say
so
a
living
interest
to
it
and
to
all
the
old
about
the
city
some
of
which
link
the
present
with
the
remote
past
by
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
interments
for
nearly
three
thousand
years
just
beyond
this
expanse
or
rather
in
part
of
it
is
a
small
plot
of
ground
surrounded
by
high
whitewashed
walls
the
entrance
to
which
is
secured
by
a
heavy
door
this
is
the
american
cemetery
and
the
stout
door
and
thick
wall
are
i
suppose
necessary
to
secure
its
graves
from
moslem
insult
it
seems
not
to
be
visited
often
for
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
could
turn
the
huge
key
in
the
rusty
lock
there
are
some
graves
within
the
graves
are
and
and
the
whole
area
is
a
tangle
of
unrestrained
weeds
and
grass
the
high
wall
cuts
off
all
view
but
we
did
not
for
the
time
miss
it
rather
liking
for
the
moment
to
be
secured
from
the
sight
of
the
awful
desolation
and
to
muse
upon
the
strange
fortune
that
had
drawn
to
be
buried
here
upon
mount
zion
as
a
holy
for
them
people
alien
in
race
language
and
customs
to
the
house
of
david
and
removed
from
it
by
such
spaces
of
time
and
distance
people
to
whom
the
worship
performed
by
david
if
he
could
renew
it
in
person
on
zion
would
be
as
distasteful
as
is
that
of
the
jews
in
yonder
synagogue
only
a
short
distance
from
this
we
came
to
the
mosque
which
contains
the
tomb
of
david
and
probably
of
solomon
and
other
kings
of
judah
no
historical
monument
in
or
about
jerusalem
is
better
authenticated
than
this
although
now
for
many
centuries
the
moslems
have
had
possession
of
it
and
forbidden
access
to
it
there
is
a
tolerably
connected
tradition
of
its
possession
it
was
twice
opened
and
relieved
of
the
enormous
treasure
in
gold
and
silver
which
solomon
deposited
in
it
once
by
hyrcanus
maccabæus
who
took
what
he
needed
and
again
by
herod
who
found
very
little
there
are
all
sorts
of
stories
told
about
the
splendor
of
this
tomb
and
the
state
with
which
the
moslems
surround
it
but
they
envelop
it
in
so
much
mystery
that
no
one
can
know
the
truth
it
is
probable
that
the
few
who
suppose
they
have
seen
it
have
seen
only
a
sort
of
cenotaph
which
is
above
the
real
tomb
in
the
rock
below
the
room
which
has
been
seen
is
embellished
with
some
display
of
richness
in
shawls
and
hangings
of
gold
embroidery
and
contains
a
sarcophagus
of
rough
stone
and
lights
are
always
burning
there
if
the
royal
tombs
are
in
this
place
they
are
doubtless
in
the
cave
below
over
this
spot
was
built
a
church
by
the
early
christians
and
it
is
a
tradition
that
in
this
building
was
the
conaculum
this
site
may
very
likely
be
that
of
the
building
where
the
last
supper
was
laid
and
it
may
be
that
stephen
suffered
martyrdom
here
and
that
the
virgin
died
here
the
building
may
be
as
old
as
the
fourth
century
but
the
chances
of
any
building
standing
so
long
in
this
repeatedly
destroyed
city
are
not
good
there
is
a
little
house
north
of
this
mosque
in
which
the
virgin
spent
the
last
years
of
her
life
if
she
did
she
must
have
lived
to
be
over
a
thousand
years
old
on
the
very
brow
of
the
hill
and
overlooking
the
lower
pool
of
gibon
is
the
english
school
with
its
pretty
garden
and
its
cemetery
we
saw
there
some
excavations
by
which
the
bedrock
had
been
laid
bare
disclosing
some
stone
steps
cut
in
it
search
is
being
made
here
for
the
seat
of
solomon
but
it
does
not
seem
to
me
a
vital
matter
for
i
suppose
he
sat
down
all
over
this
hill
which
was
covered
with
his
palaces
and
harems
and
other
buildings
of
pleasure
built
of
stones
that
of
great
value
such
as
are
dug
out
of
the
earth
for
the
ornaments
of
temples
and
to
make
fine
prospects
in
royal
palaces
and
which
make
the
mines
whence
they
are
dug
solomon
palace
was
constructed
entirely
of
white
stone
and
and
gold
and
silver
in
it
very
long
cloisters
and
those
situate
in
an
agreeable
place
in
the
palace
and
among
them
a
most
glorious
for
feastings
and
indeed
josephus
finds
it
difficult
to
reckon
up
the
variety
and
the
magnitude
of
the
royal
apartments
many
that
were
subterraneous
and
invisible
the
curiosity
of
those
that
enjoyed
the
fresh
air
and
the
groves
for
the
most
delightful
prospect
for
avoiding
the
heat
and
covering
their
if
this
most
luxurious
of
monarchs
introduced
here
all
the
styles
of
architecture
which
would
represent
the
nationality
of
his
wives
as
he
built
temples
to
suit
their
different
religions
the
hill
of
zion
must
have
resembled
on
a
small
scale
the
munich
of
king
ludwig
i
opposite
the
english
school
across
the
valley
of
hinnom
is
a
long
block
of
modern
buildings
which
is
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
objects
outside
the
city
it
was
built
by
another
rich
jew
sir
moses
montefiore
of
london
and
contains
tenements
for
poor
jews
sir
moses
is
probably
as
rich
as
solomon
was
in
his
own
right
and
he
makes
a
most
charitable
use
of
his
money
but
i
do
not
suppose
that
if
he
had
at
his
command
the
public
wealth
that
solomon
had
who
made
silver
as
plentiful
as
stones
in
the
streets
of
jerusalem
he
could
materially
alleviate
the
lazy
indigence
of
the
jewish
exiles
here
the
aged
philanthropist
made
a
journey
hither
in
the
summer
of
to
ascertain
for
himself
the
condition
of
the
jews
i
believe
he
has
a
hope
of
establishing
manufactories
in
which
they
can
support
themselves
but
the
minds
of
the
jews
who
are
already
restored
are
not
set
upon
any
sort
of
industry
it
seems
to
me
that
they
could
be
maintained
much
more
cheaply
if
they
were
transported
to
a
less
barren
land
we
made
one
day
an
exploration
of
the
jews
quarter
which
enjoys
the
reputation
of
being
more
filthy
than
the
christian
the
approach
to
it
is
down
a
gutter
which
has
the
sounding
name
of
the
street
of
david
it
was
bad
enough
but
when
we
entered
the
jews
part
of
the
city
we
found
ourselves
in
lanes
and
gutters
of
incomparable
unpleasantness
and
almost
impassable
with
nothing
whatever
in
them
interesting
or
picturesque
except
the
inhabitants
we
had
a
curiosity
to
see
if
there
were
here
any
real
jews
of
the
type
that
inhabited
the
city
in
the
time
of
our
lord
and
we
saw
many
with
fair
skin
and
light
hair
with
straight
nose
and
regular
features
the
persons
whom
we
are
accustomed
to
call
jews
and
who
were
found
dispersed
about
europe
at
a
very
early
period
of
modern
history
have
the
assyrian
features
the
hook
nose
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
not
at
all
the
faces
of
the
race
from
which
our
saviour
is
supposed
to
have
sprung
the
kingdom
of
israel
which
contained
the
ten
tribes
was
gobbled
up
by
the
assyrians
about
the
time
rome
was
founded
and
from
that
date
these
tribes
do
not
appear
historically
they
may
have
entirely
amalgamated
with
their
conquerors
and
the
modified
race
subsequently
have
passed
into
europe
for
the
jews
claim
to
have
been
in
europe
before
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
by
titus
in
which
nearly
all
the
people
of
the
kingdom
of
judah
perished
some
scholars
who
have
investigated
the
problem
offered
by
the
two
types
above
mentioned
think
that
the
jew
as
we
know
him
in
europe
and
america
is
not
the
direct
descendant
of
the
jews
of
jerusalem
of
the
time
of
herod
and
that
the
true
offspring
of
the
latter
is
the
person
of
the
light
hair
and
straight
nose
who
is
occasionally
to
be
found
in
jerusalem
until
this
ethnological
problem
is
settled
i
shall
most
certainly
withhold
my
feeble
contributions
for
the
of
the
persons
at
present
doing
business
under
the
name
of
jews
among
the
western
nations
but
we
saw
another
type
of
jew
or
rather
another
variety
in
this
quarter
he
called
himself
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
and
is
i
think
the
most
unpleasant
human
being
i
have
ever
encountered
every
man
who
supposes
himself
of
this
tribe
wears
a
dark
corkscrew
stringy
curl
hanging
down
each
side
of
his
face
and
the
appearance
of
nasty
effeminacy
which
this
gives
can
not
be
described
the
tribe
of
benjamin
does
not
figure
well
in
sacred
history
was
it
was
pretty
much
exterminated
by
the
other
tribes
once
for
an
awful
crime
it
was
held
from
going
into
the
settled
idolatry
of
the
kingdom
of
israel
only
by
its
contiguity
to
judah
it
was
better
than
its
descendants
if
these
are
its
descendants
more
than
half
of
the
eight
thousand
jews
in
jerusalem
speak
spanish
as
their
native
tongue
and
are
the
offspring
of
those
expelled
from
spain
by
ferdinand
now
and
then
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
spanish
or
arabic
we
saw
a
good
face
a
noble
countenance
a
fine
oriental
and
venerable
type
and
occasionally
looking
from
a
window
a
jewish
beauty
but
the
most
whom
we
met
were
debased
the
remnants
of
sin
squalor
and
bad
living
we
went
into
two
of
the
best
synagogues
new
with
a
conspicuous
green
dome
they
are
not
fine
on
the
contrary
they
are
slatternly
places
and
very
on
the
benches
near
the
windows
sat
squalid
men
and
boys
reading
the
latter
no
doubt
students
of
the
law
all
the
passages
stairs
and
were
dirty
and
disorderly
as
if
it
were
always
monday
morning
there
but
never
rags
and
heaps
of
ancient
garments
were
strewn
about
and
occasionally
we
nearly
stumbled
over
a
jew
indistinguishable
from
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
and
asleep
on
the
floor
even
the
sanctuary
is
full
of
unkempt
people
and
of
the
evidences
of
the
squalor
of
the
quarter
if
this
is
a
specimen
of
the
restoration
of
the
jews
they
had
better
not
be
restored
any
more
the
thing
to
do
if
the
worldliness
of
the
expression
will
be
pardoned
friday
is
to
go
and
see
the
jews
wail
as
in
constantinople
it
is
to
see
the
sultan
go
to
prayer
and
in
cairo
to
hear
the
darwishes
howl
the
performance
being
an
one
is
sometimes
prevented
by
rain
or
snow
but
otherwise
it
has
not
failed
for
many
centuries
this
ancient
practice
is
probably
not
what
it
once
was
having
in
our
modern
days
by
becoming
a
sort
of
fashion
lost
its
spontaneity
it
will
however
doubtless
be
long
kept
up
as
everything
of
this
sort
endures
in
the
east
even
if
it
should
become
necessary
to
hire
people
to
wail
the
friday
morning
of
the
day
chosen
for
our
visit
to
the
wailing
place
was
rainy
following
a
rainy
night
the
open
alleys
were
gutters
of
mud
the
streets
under
arches
for
there
are
shops
in
subterranean
constructions
and
old
vaulted
passages
were
damper
and
darker
than
usual
the
whole
city
with
its
narrow
lanes
and
thick
walls
and
no
sewers
was
clammy
and
uncomfortable
we
loitered
for
a
time
in
the
dark
and
gold
bazaars
where
there
is
but
a
poor
display
of
attractions
pilgrims
from
all
lands
were
sopping
about
in
the
streets
conspicuous
among
them
were
persians
wearing
high
conical
frieze
hats
and
russian
peasant
women
we
walked
across
to
the
zion
gate
and
mounting
the
city
wall
uneven
and
somewhat
broken
but
sightly
it
round
to
its
junction
with
the
temple
wall
and
to
robinson
arch
underneath
the
wall
by
zion
gate
dwell
in
low
stone
huts
and
burrows
a
considerable
number
of
lepers
who
form
a
horrid
community
by
themselves
these
poor
creatures
with
toeless
feet
and
fingerless
hands
came
out
of
their
dens
and
assailed
us
with
piteous
cries
for
charity
what
could
be
done
it
was
impossible
to
give
to
all
the
little
we
threw
them
they
fought
for
and
the
unsuccessful
followed
us
with
whetted
eagerness
we
could
do
nothing
but
flee
and
we
climbed
the
wall
and
ran
down
it
leaving
demetrius
behind
as
a
i
should
have
had
more
pity
for
them
if
they
had
not
exhibited
so
much
maliciousness
they
knew
their
power
and
brought
all
their
loathsomeness
after
us
thinking
that
we
would
be
forced
to
buy
their
retreat
two
hideous
old
women
followed
us
a
long
distance
and
when
they
became
convinced
that
further
howling
and
whining
would
be
fruitless
they
suddenly
changed
tone
and
cursed
us
with
healthful
vigor
having
cursed
us
they
hobbled
home
to
roost
this
part
of
the
wall
crosses
what
was
once
the
tyrophoan
valley
which
is
now
pretty
much
filled
up
it
ran
between
mount
moriah
on
which
the
temple
stood
and
mount
zion
it
was
spanned
in
ancient
times
by
a
bridge
some
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
resting
on
stone
arches
whose
piers
must
have
been
from
one
hundred
to
two
hundred
feet
in
height
this
connected
the
temple
platform
with
the
top
of
the
steep
side
of
zion
it
was
on
the
temple
end
of
this
bridge
that
titus
stood
and
held
parley
with
the
jews
who
refused
to
surrender
zion
after
the
loss
of
moriah
the
exact
locality
of
this
interesting
bridge
was
discovered
by
robinson
just
north
of
the
southwest
corner
of
the
harem
wall
that
is
the
temple
or
mount
moriah
wall
he
noticed
three
courses
of
huge
projecting
stones
which
upon
careful
inspection
proved
to
be
the
segment
of
an
arch
the
spring
of
the
arch
is
so
plainly
to
be
seen
now
that
it
is
a
wonder
it
remained
so
long
unknown
the
wailing
place
of
the
jews
is
on
the
west
side
of
the
temple
enclosure
a
little
to
the
north
of
this
arch
it
is
in
a
long
narrow
court
formed
by
the
walls
of
modern
houses
and
the
huge
blocks
of
stone
of
this
part
of
the
original
wall
these
stones
are
no
doubt
as
old
as
solomon
temple
and
the
jews
can
here
touch
the
very
walls
of
the
platform
of
that
sacred
edifice
every
friday
a
remnant
of
the
children
of
israel
comes
here
to
weep
and
wail
they
bring
their
scriptures
and
leaning
against
the
stone
facing
it
read
the
lamentations
and
the
psalms
in
a
wailing
voice
and
occasionally
cry
aloud
in
a
chorus
of
lamentation
weeping
blowing
their
long
noses
with
blue
cotton
handkerchiefs
and
kissing
the
stones
we
were
told
that
the
smoothness
of
the
stones
in
spots
was
owing
to
centuries
of
osculation
the
men
stand
together
at
one
part
of
the
wall
and
the
women
at
another
there
were
not
more
than
twenty
jews
present
as
actors
in
the
solemn
ceremony
the
day
we
visited
the
spot
and
they
did
not
wail
much
merely
reading
the
scriptures
in
a
mumbling
voice
and
swaying
their
bodies
backward
and
forward
still
they
formed
picturesque
and
even
pathetic
groups
venerable
old
men
with
long
white
beards
and
hooked
noses
clad
in
rags
and
shreds
and
patches
in
all
degrees
of
decadence
lank
creatures
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
with
the
corkscrew
curls
and
skinny
old
women
shaking
with
weeping
real
or
assumed
very
likely
these
wailers
were
as
poor
and
wretched
as
they
appeared
to
be
and
their
tears
were
the
natural
outcome
of
their
grief
over
the
ruin
of
the
temple
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
i
should
be
the
last
one
to
doubt
their
enjoyment
of
this
weekly
bitter
misery
but
the
demonstration
had
somewhat
the
appearance
of
a
set
and
show
performance
while
it
was
going
on
a
shrewd
israelite
went
about
with
a
box
to
collect
mites
from
the
spectators
there
were
many
more
travellers
there
to
see
the
wailing
than
there
were
jews
to
wail
this
also
lent
an
unfavorable
aspect
to
the
scene
i
myself
felt
that
if
this
were
genuine
i
had
no
business
to
be
there
with
my
undisguised
curiosity
and
if
it
were
not
genuine
it
was
the
poorest
spectacle
that
jerusalem
offers
to
the
tourist
cook
party
was
there
in
force
this
being
one
of
the
things
promised
in
the
contract
and
i
soon
found
myself
more
interested
in
cook
pilgrims
than
in
the
others
the
scripture
read
and
wailed
this
day
was
the
psalm
of
david
if
you
turn
to
it
you
may
have
already
discovered
that
the
covert
purpose
of
these
desultory
notes
is
to
compel
you
to
read
your
bible
you
will
see
that
it
expresses
david
penitence
in
the
matter
of
bathsheba
places
op
the
holy
city
the
sojourner
in
jerusalem
falls
into
the
habit
of
dropping
in
at
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
nearly
every
afternoon
it
is
the
centre
of
attraction
there
the
pilgrims
all
resort
there
one
sees
in
a
day
many
races
and
the
costumes
of
strange
and
distant
peoples
there
one
sees
the
various
worship
of
the
many
christian
sects
there
are
always
processions
making
the
round
of
the
holy
places
sect
following
sect
with
swinging
censers
each
fumigating
away
the
effect
of
its
predecessor
the
central
body
of
the
church
answering
to
the
nave
as
the
rotunda
which
contains
the
holy
sepulchre
answers
to
choir
and
apse
is
the
greek
chapel
and
the
most
magnificent
in
the
building
the
portion
of
the
church
set
apart
to
the
latins
opening
also
out
of
the
rotunda
is
merely
a
small
chapel
the
armenians
have
still
more
contracted
accommodations
and
the
poor
copts
enjoy
a
mere
closet
but
it
is
in
a
sacred
spot
being
attached
to
the
west
end
of
the
sepulchre
itself
on
the
western
side
of
the
rotunda
we
passed
through
the
bare
and
apparently
chapel
of
the
syrians
and
entered
through
a
low
door
into
a
small
grotto
hewn
in
the
rock
lighted
candles
revealed
to
us
some
tombs
little
pits
cut
in
the
rock
two
in
the
and
two
in
the
floor
we
had
a
guide
who
knew
every
sacred
spot
in
the
city
a
man
who
never
failed
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
the
most
credulous
tourist
tombs
are
these
we
asked
is
the
tomb
of
joseph
of
arimathea
and
that
beside
it
is
the
tomb
of
do
you
know
do
i
know
you
ask
me
how
i
know
have
i
always
lived
in
jerusalem
i
was
born
perhaps
you
can
tell
us
if
this
tomb
belonged
to
joseph
of
arimathea
and
this
to
nicodemus
whose
is
this
third
one
yes
that
other
replied
the
guide
with
only
a
paralysis
of
his
invention
is
the
tomb
of
arimathea
one
afternoon
at
four
service
was
going
on
in
the
greek
chapel
which
shone
with
silver
and
blazed
with
tapers
and
was
crowded
with
pilgrims
principally
russians
of
both
sexes
many
of
whom
had
made
a
painful
pilgrimage
of
more
than
two
thousand
miles
on
foot
merely
to
prostrate
themselves
in
this
revered
place
a
russian
bishop
and
a
priest
in
the
resplendent
robes
of
their
office
were
intoning
the
service
responsively
in
the
very
centre
of
this
chapel
is
a
round
hole
covered
with
a
grating
and
tapers
are
generally
burning
about
it
all
the
pilgrims
kneeled
there
and
kissed
the
grating
and
adored
the
hole
i
had
the
curiosity
to
push
my
way
through
the
throng
in
order
to
see
the
object
of
devotion
but
i
could
discover
nothing
it
is
however
an
important
spot
it
is
the
centre
of
the
earth
though
why
christians
should
worship
the
centre
of
the
earth
i
do
not
know
the
armenians
have
in
their
chapel
also
a
spot
that
they
say
is
the
real
centre
that
makes
three
that
we
know
of
for
everybody
understands
that
there
is
one
in
the
kaaba
at
mecca
we
sat
down
upon
a
stone
bench
near
the
entrance
of
the
chapel
where
we
could
observe
the
passing
streams
of
people
and
were
greatly
diverted
by
a
blithe
and
comical
beggar
who
had
stationed
himself
on
the
pavement
there
to
intercept
the
greek
charity
of
the
worshippers
when
they
passed
into
the
rotunda
he
was
a
diminutive
man
with
distorted
limbs
he
wore
a
peaked
red
cap
and
dragged
himself
over
the
pavement
or
rather
skipped
and
flopped
about
on
it
like
a
on
land
never
was
seen
in
a
beggar
such
vivacity
and
imperturbable
with
so
much
deviltry
in
his
dancing
eyes
as
we
appeared
to
him
to
occupy
a
neutral
position
as
to
him
and
his
victims
he
soon
took
us
into
his
confidence
and
let
us
see
his
mode
of
operations
he
said
to
our
guide
that
he
was
a
greek
from
damascus
yes
a
christian
a
pilgrim
who
always
came
down
here
at
this
season
which
was
his
he
hoped
with
a
wicked
wink
that
his
devotion
would
be
rewarded
it
was
very
entertaining
to
see
him
watch
the
people
coming
out
and
select
his
victims
whom
he
would
indicate
to
us
by
a
motion
of
his
head
as
he
hopped
towards
them
he
appeared
to
rely
more
upon
the
poor
and
simple
than
upon
the
rich
and
he
was
more
successful
with
the
former
but
he
rarely
such
was
his
insight
made
a
mistake
whoever
gave
him
anything
he
thanked
with
the
utmost
empressement
of
manner
then
he
crossed
himself
and
turned
around
and
winked
at
us
his
confederates
when
an
elegantly
dressed
lady
dropped
the
smallest
of
copper
coins
into
his
cap
he
let
us
know
his
opinion
of
her
by
a
significant
gesture
and
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
but
no
matter
from
whom
he
received
it
whenever
he
added
a
penny
to
his
store
the
rascal
chirped
and
laughed
and
caressed
himself
he
was
in
the
way
of
being
trodden
under
foot
by
the
crowd
but
his
agility
was
extraordinary
and
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
at
any
moment
if
he
had
vaulted
over
the
heads
of
the
throng
and
disappeared
if
he
failed
to
attract
the
attention
of
an
eligible
pilgrim
he
did
not
hesitate
to
give
the
skirt
of
his
elect
a
jerk
for
which
rudeness
he
would
at
once
apologize
with
an
indescribable
grimace
and
a
joke
when
the
crowd
had
passed
he
slid
himself
into
a
corner
by
a
motion
such
as
that
with
which
a
fish
suddenly
darts
to
one
side
and
set
himself
to
empty
his
pocket
into
his
cap
and
count
his
plunder
tossing
the
pieces
into
the
air
and
catching
them
with
a
chuckle
crossing
himself
and
hugging
himself
by
turns
he
had
four
francs
and
a
half
when
he
had
finished
counting
his
money
he
put
it
in
a
bag
and
for
a
moment
his
face
assumed
a
grave
and
expression
we
thought
he
would
depart
without
demanding
anything
of
us
but
we
were
mistaken
he
had
something
in
view
that
he
no
doubt
felt
would
insure
him
a
liberal
backsheesh
wriggling
near
to
us
he
set
his
face
into
an
expression
of
demure
humility
held
out
his
cap
and
said
in
english
each
word
falling
from
his
lips
as
distinctly
and
unnaturally
as
if
he
had
been
a
wooden
articulating
machine
unto
me
all
ye
that
labor
and
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
the
rascal
impiety
lessened
the
charity
which
our
intimacy
with
him
had
intended
but
he
appeared
entirely
content
chirped
saluted
with
gravity
and
with
a
flop
was
gone
from
our
sight
at
the
moment
a
procession
of
franciscan
monks
swept
by
chanting
in
rich
bass
voices
and
followed
as
usual
by
latin
pilgrims
making
the
daily
round
of
the
holy
places
after
they
had
disappeared
we
could
still
hear
their
voices
and
catch
now
and
again
the
glimmer
of
their
tapers
in
the
vast
dark
spaces
opposite
the
place
where
we
were
sitting
is
the
chapel
of
the
apparition
a
room
not
much
more
than
twenty
feet
square
it
is
the
latin
chapel
and
besides
its
contiguity
to
the
sepulchre
has
some
specialties
of
its
own
the
chapel
is
probably
eight
hundred
years
old
in
the
centre
of
the
pavement
is
the
spot
upon
which
our
lord
stood
when
he
appeared
to
the
virgin
after
the
resurrection
near
it
a
slab
marks
the
place
where
the
three
crosses
were
laid
after
they
were
dug
up
by
helena
and
where
the
one
on
which
our
lord
was
crucified
was
identified
by
the
miracle
that
it
worked
in
healing
a
sick
man
south
of
the
altar
is
a
niche
in
the
wall
now
covered
over
but
a
round
hole
is
left
in
the
covering
i
saw
pilgrims
thrust
a
long
stick
into
this
hole
withdraw
it
and
kiss
the
end
the
stick
had
touched
a
fragment
of
the
porphyry
column
to
which
the
saviour
was
bound
when
he
was
scourged
in
the
semicircle
at
the
east
end
of
the
nave
are
several
interesting
places
the
prison
where
christ
was
confined
before
his
execution
a
chapel
dedicated
to
the
centurion
who
pierced
the
side
of
our
lord
and
the
spot
on
which
the
vestments
were
divided
from
thence
we
descend
by
a
long
flight
of
steps
partly
hewn
in
the
rock
to
a
rude
chapel
in
the
heavy
early
byzantine
style
a
damp
cheerless
place
called
the
chapel
of
helena
at
the
east
end
of
it
another
flight
of
steps
leads
down
into
what
was
formerly
a
cistern
but
is
now
called
the
chapel
of
the
invention
of
the
cross
here
the
cross
was
found
and
at
one
side
of
the
steps
stands
the
marble
chair
in
which
the
mother
of
constantine
sat
while
she
superintended
the
digging
nothing
is
wanting
that
the
most
credulous
pilgrim
could
wish
to
see
that
is
nothing
is
wanting
in
spots
where
things
were
this
chapel
belongs
to
the
latins
that
of
helena
to
the
greeks
the
abyssinian
convent
is
above
both
of
them
on
the
south
side
of
the
church
near
the
entrance
is
a
dark
room
called
the
chapel
of
adam
in
which
there
is
never
more
light
than
a
feeble
taper
can
give
i
groped
my
way
into
it
often
in
the
hope
of
finding
something
perhaps
it
is
purposely
involved
in
an
obscurity
typical
of
the
origin
of
mankind
there
is
a
tradition
that
adam
was
buried
on
golgotha
but
the
only
tomb
in
this
chapel
is
that
of
melchizedek
the
chapel
formerly
contained
that
of
godfrey
de
bouillon
elected
the
first
king
of
jerusalem
in
and
of
baldwin
his
brother
we
were
shown
the
sword
of
godfrey
with
which
he
clove
a
saracen
lengthwise
into
two
equal
parts
a
genuine
relic
of
a
heroic
and
barbarous
age
at
the
end
of
this
chapel
a
glimmering
light
lets
us
see
through
a
grating
a
crack
in
the
rock
made
by
the
earthquake
at
the
crucifixion
the
gloom
of
this
mysterious
chapel
which
is
haunted
by
the
spectre
of
that
dim
shadow
of
unreality
melchizedek
prepared
us
to
ascend
to
golgotha
above
it
the
chapels
of
golgotha
are
supported
partly
upon
a
rock
which
rises
fifteen
feet
above
the
pavement
of
the
church
the
first
is
that
of
the
elevation
of
the
cross
and
belongs
to
the
greeks
under
the
altar
at
the
east
end
is
a
hole
in
the
marble
which
is
over
the
hole
in
the
rock
in
which
the
cross
stood
on
either
side
of
it
are
the
holes
of
the
crosses
of
the
two
thieves
the
altar
is
rich
with
silver
and
gold
and
jewels
the
chamber
when
we
entered
it
was
blazing
with
light
and
latin
monks
were
performing
their
adorations
with
chanting
and
swinging
of
incense
before
the
altar
a
greek
priest
stood
at
one
side
watching
them
and
there
was
plain
contempt
in
his
face
the
greek
priests
are
not
wanting
in
fanaticism
but
they
never
seem
to
me
to
possess
the
faith
of
the
latin
branch
of
the
catholic
church
when
the
latins
had
gone
the
greek
took
us
behind
the
altar
and
showed
us
another
in
the
rock
adjoining
this
chapel
is
the
latin
chapel
of
the
crucifixion
marking
the
spot
where
christ
was
nailed
to
the
cross
from
that
we
looked
through
a
window
into
an
exterior
room
dedicated
to
the
sorrowing
virgin
where
she
stood
and
beheld
the
crucifixion
both
these
latter
rooms
do
not
rest
upon
the
rock
but
upon
artificial
vaults
and
of
course
can
mark
the
spots
commemorated
by
them
only
in
space
perhaps
this
sensation
of
being
in
the
air
and
of
having
no
even
for
tradition
added
something
to
the
strange
feeling
that
took
possession
of
me
a
mingled
feeling
that
was
no
more
terror
than
is
the
apprehension
that
one
experiences
at
a
theatre
from
the
manufactured
thunder
behind
the
scenes
i
suppose
it
arose
from
cross
currents
meeting
in
the
mind
the
thought
of
the
awful
significance
of
the
events
here
represented
and
the
sight
of
this
theatrical
representation
the
dreadful
name
golgotha
the
gloom
of
this
part
of
the
building
sort
of
mount
of
darkness
with
its
rent
rock
and
preternatural
shadow
blazing
contrast
of
the
chapel
where
the
cross
stood
with
the
dark
passages
about
it
the
chanting
and
flashing
lights
of
pilgrims
ever
coming
and
going
the
neighborhood
of
the
sepulchre
itself
were
well
calculated
to
awaken
an
imagination
the
least
sensitive
and
so
susceptible
is
the
mind
to
the
influence
of
that
mental
there
is
no
better
name
for
proceeds
from
a
mass
of
minds
having
one
thought
and
is
sometimes
called
public
opinion
be
it
true
or
false
that
whatever
one
may
believe
about
the
real
location
of
the
holy
sepulchre
he
can
not
witness
unmoved
the
vast
throng
of
pilgrims
to
these
shrines
representing
as
they
do
every
section
of
the
civilized
and
of
the
uncivilized
world
into
which
a
belief
in
the
cross
has
penetrated
the
undoubted
sincerity
of
the
majority
of
the
pilgrims
who
worship
here
makes
us
for
the
time
forget
the
hundred
inventions
which
so
often
allure
and
as
often
misdirect
that
worship
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
offers
at
all
times
a
great
spectacle
and
one
always
novel
in
the
striking
ceremonies
and
the
people
who
assist
at
them
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
that
of
the
holy
fire
at
the
greek
easter
which
is
three
weeks
later
than
the
roman
and
which
has
been
so
often
described
we
did
not
see
i
am
not
sure
that
we
saw
even
all
the
holy
places
and
objects
in
the
church
it
may
not
be
unprofitable
to
set
down
those
i
can
recall
they
are
the
stone
of
unction
the
spot
where
the
virgin
mary
stood
when
the
body
of
our
lord
was
anointed
the
holy
sepulchre
the
stone
on
which
the
angel
sat
the
tombs
of
joseph
of
arimathea
and
nicodemus
the
well
of
helena
the
stone
marking
the
spot
where
christ
in
the
form
of
a
gardener
appeared
to
mary
magdalene
the
spot
where
mary
magdalene
stood
the
spot
where
our
lord
appeared
to
the
virgin
after
his
resurrection
the
place
where
the
true
cross
discovered
by
helena
was
laid
and
identified
by
a
miracle
the
fragment
of
the
column
of
flagellation
the
prison
of
our
lord
the
of
christ
a
stone
with
two
holes
in
it
the
place
where
the

on
the

was
preserved

crowned

spots
where
the
tombs
of
godfrey
and
baldwin
stood
no
we
did
not
see
them
all
besides
there
used
to
be
a
piece
of
the
cross
in
the
latin
chapel
but
the
armenians
are
accused
of
purloining
it
all
travellers
i
suppose
have
seen
the
celebrated
iron
crown
of
lombardy
which
is
kept
in
the
church
at
monza
near
milan
it
is
all
of
gold
except
the
inner
band
which
is
made
of
a
nail
of
the
cross
brought
from
jerusalem
by
helena
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
has
not
all
the
relics
it
might
have
but
it
is
as
rich
in
them
as
any
church
of
its
age
a
place
in
jerusalem
almost
as
interesting
to
christians
as
the
holy
sepulchre
and
more
interesting
to
antiquarians
is
the
harem
or
temple
area
with
its
ancient
substructions
and
its
resplendent
saracenic
architecture
it
is
largely
an
open
place
green
with
grass
it
is
clean
and
wholesome
and
the
sun
lies
lovingly
on
it
there
is
no
part
of
the
city
where
the
traveller
would
so
like
to
wander
at
will
to
sit
and
muse
to
dream
away
the
day
on
the
walls
overhanging
the
valley
of
the
kidron
to
recall
at
leisure
all
the
wonderful
story
of
its
splendor
and
its
disaster
but
admission
to
the
area
is
had
only
by
special
permit
therefore
the
ordinary
tourist
goes
not
so
much
as
he
desires
to
the
site
of
the
temple
that
solomon
built
and
of
the
porch
where
jesus
walked
and
talked
with
his
disciples
when
he
does
go
he
feels
that
he
treads
upon
firm
historical
ground
we
walked
down
the
gutter
called
street
of
david
we
did
not
enter
the
harem
area
by
the
bab
gate
of
the
chain
but
turned
northward
and
went
in
by
the
bab
gate
of
the
which
is
identified
with
the
beautiful
gate
of
the
temple
both
these
gates
have
twisted
columns
and
are
graceful
examples
of
saracenic
architecture
as
soon
as
we
entered
the
gate
the
splendor
of
the
area
burst
upon
us
we
passed
instantly
out
of
the
sordid
city
into
a
green
plain
out
of
could
have
been
by
a
magic
wand
sprung
the
most
charming
creations
in
stone
minarets
domes
colonnades
cloisters
pavilions
columns
of
all
orders
horseshoe
arches
and
pointed
arches
every
joyous
architectural
thought
expressed
in
shining
marble
and
brilliant
color
our
dragoman
did
the
honors
of
the
place
with
the
air
of
proprietorship
for
the
first
time
in
the
holy
city
he
felt
quite
at
home
and
appeared
to
be
on
the
same
terms
with
the
temple
area
that
he
is
with
the
tombs
of
the
pharaohs
the
christian
antiquities
are
too
much
for
him
but
his
elastic
mind
expands
readily
to
all
the
marvels
of
the
moslem
situation
the
moslems
indeed
consider
that
they
have
a
much
better
right
to
the
temple
than
the
christians
and
acted
as
our
cicerone
in
the
precincts
with
all
the
delight
of
a
boy
and
with
the
enthusiasm
of
faith
it
was
not
unpleasant
to
him
either
to
have
us
see
that
he
was
treated
with
consideration
by
the
mosque
attendants
and
ulemas
and
that
he
was
well
known
and
could
pass
readily
into
the
most
reserved
places
he
had
said
his
prayers
that
morning
at
twelve
in
this
mosque
a
privilege
only
second
to
that
of
praying
in
the
mosque
at
mecca
and
was
in
high
spirits
as
one
who
had
if
the
expression
is
allowable
got
a
little
ahead
in
the
matter
of
devotion
let
me
give
in
a
few
words
without
any
qualifications
of
doubt
what
seem
to
be
the
facts
about
this
area
it
is
at
present
a
level
piece
of
ground
in
the
nature
of
a
platform
since
it
is
sustained
on
all
sides
by
walls
a
quadrilateral
with
its
sides
not
quite
parallel
about
fifteen
hundred
feet
long
by
one
thousand
feet
broad
the
northern
third
of
it
was
covered
by
the
fortress
of
antonia
an
ancient
palace
and
fortress
rebuilt
with
great
splendor
by
herod
the
small
remains
of
it
in
the
northeast
corner
are
now
barracks
this
level
piece
of
ground
is
nearly
all
artificial
either
filled
in
or
built
up
on
arches
the
original
ground
mount
moriah
was
a
rocky
hill
the
summit
of
which
was
the
rock
about
which
there
has
been
so
much
controversy
near
the
centre
of
this
ground
and
upon
a
broad
raised
platform
paved
with
marble
stands
the
celebrated
mosque
kubbet
dome
of
the
it
is
built
over
the
sacred
rock
this
rock
marks
the
site
of
the
of
oman
the
jebusite
which
david
bought
purchasing
at
the
same
time
the
whole
of
mount
moriah
solomon
built
the
temple
over
this
rock
and
it
was
probably
the
of
at
the
time
solomon
built
the
temple
the
level
place
on
moriah
was
scarcely
large
enough
for
the
naos
of
that
building
and
solomon
extended
the
ground
to
the
east
and
south
by
erecting
arches
and
filling
in
on
top
of
them
and
constructing
a
heavy
outside
on
the
east
side
also
he
built
a
porch
or
magnificent
colonnade
which
must
have
produced
a
fine
effect
of
oriental
grandeur
when
seen
from
the
deep
valley
below
or
from
the
mount
of
olives
opposite
to
this
rock
the
jews
used
to
come
in
the
fourth
century
and
anoint
it
with
oil
and
wail
over
it
as
the
site
of
the
temple
on
it
once
stood
a
statue
of
hadrian
when
the
moslems
captured
jerusalem
it
became
what
it
has
ever
since
been
one
of
their
most
venerated
places
the
khalif
omar
cleared
away
the
rubbish
from
it
and
built
over
it
a
mosque
the
khalif
began
to
rebuild
it
in
during
the
crusades
it
was
used
as
a
christian
church
allowing
for
decay
and
repairs
the
present
mosque
is
probably
substantially
that
built
by
at
the
extreme
south
of
the
area
is
the
vast
mosque
of
aksa
a
splendid
basilica
with
seven
aisles
which
may
or
may
not
be
the
church
of
mary
built
by
justinian
in
the
sixth
century
architects
differ
about
it
this
question
it
seems
to
me
very
difficult
to
decide
from
the
architecture
of
the
building
because
of
the
habit
that
christians
and
moslems
both
had
of
appropriating
columns
and
capitals
of
ancient
structures
in
their
buildings
and
because
the
moslems
at
that
time
used
both
the
round
and
the
pointed
arch
this
platform
is
beyond
all
comparison
the
most
beautiful
place
in
jerusalem
and
its
buildings
when
seen
from
the
hill
opposite
give
to
the
city
its
chief
claim
to
oriental
picturesqueness
the
dome
of
the
mosque
is
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
in
the
world
it
seems
to
float
in
the
air
like
a
blown
bubble
this
effect
is
produced
by
a
slight
drawing
in
of
the
base
this
contraction
of
the
dome
is
not
sufficient
to
give
the
spectator
any
feeling
of
insecurity
or
to
belittle
this
architectural
marvel
to
the
likeness
of
a
big
toy
the
builder
hit
the
exact
mean
between
massiveness
and
expanding
lightness
the
mosque
is
octagonal
in
form
and
although
its
just
proportions
make
it
appear
small
it
is
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
diameter
outside
and
in
it
is
a
blaze
of
color
in
brilliant
marbles
fine
mosaics
stained
glass
and
beautiful
saracenic
tiles
the
lower
part
of
the
exterior
wall
is
covered
with
colored
marbles
in
intricate
patterns
above
are
pointed
windows
with
stained
glass
and
the
spaces
between
the
windows
are
covered
by
glazed
tiles
with
arabesque
designs
and
very
rich
in
color
in
the
interior
which
has
all
the
soft
warmth
and
richness
of
persian
needlework
are
two
corridors
with
rows
of
columns
and
pillars
within
the
inner
row
is
the
sacred
rock
this
rock
which
is
the
most
remarkable
stone
in
the
world
if
half
we
hear
of
it
be
true
and
which
by
a
singular
fortune
is
sacred
to
three
religions
is
an
irregular
bowlder
standing
some
five
feet
above
the
pavement
and
is
something
like
sixty
feet
long
in
places
it
has
been
chiselled
steps
are
cut
on
one
side
and
various
niches
are
hewn
in
it
a
round
hole
pierces
it
from
top
to
bottom
the
rock
is
limestone
a
little
colored
with
iron
and
beautiful
in
spots
where
it
has
been
polished
one
would
think
that
by
this
time
it
ought
to
be
worn
smooth
all
over
if
we
may
believe
the
moslems
and
doubt
our
own
senses
this
rock
is
suspended
in
the
air
having
no
support
on
any
side
it
was
to
this
rock
that
mohammed
made
his
midnight
journey
on
el
burak
it
was
from
here
that
he
ascended
into
paradise
an
excursion
that
occupied
him
altogether
only
forty
minutes
it
is
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
miraculous
suspension
of
this
stone
that
is
the
basis
of
the
christian
fable
of
the
suspension
of
mohammed
coffin
miracle
unknown
to
all
moslems
of
whom
i
have
inquired
concerning
it
i
said
this
rock
rest
on
nothing
i
have
hunderstood
thim
say
do
you
believe
it
i
read
him
i
believe
when
i
come
and
see
him
i
ca
help
what
i
at
the
south
end
of
the
rock
we
descended
a
flight
of
steps
and
stood
under
the
rock
in
what
is
called
the
noble
cave
a
small
room
about
six
feet
high
plastered
and
whitewashed
this
is
supposed
to
be
the
sink
into
which
the
blood
of
the
jewish
sacrifices
drained
the
plaster
and
whitewash
hide
the
original
rock
and
give
the
moslems
the
opportunity
to
assert
that
there
is
no
rock
foundation
under
the
big
stone
we
said
to
this
rock
hangs
in
the
air
why
can
not
we
see
all
around
it
why
these
plaster
walls
that
seem
to
support
it
him
used
to
be
this
done
so
i
hear
on
account
of
de
women
thim
come
here
see
this
rock
thim
berry
much
frightened
der
little
shild
what
you
call
it
get
born
in
de
world
before
him
wanted
so
thim
make
this
wall
under
there
are
four
altars
in
this
cave
one
of
them
dedicated
to
david
here
the
moslem
prophets
abraham
david
solomon
and
jesus
used
to
pray
in
the
rock
is
a
round
indentation
made
by
mohammed
head
when
he
first
attempted
to
rise
to
heaven
near
it
is
the
hole
through
which
he
rose
on
the
upper
southeast
corner
of
the
rock
is
the
print
of
the
prophet
foot
and
close
to
it
the
print
of
the
hand
of
the
angel
michael
who
held
the
rock
down
from
following
mohammed
into
the
skies
in
the
mosque
above
led
us
with
much
solemnity
to
a
small
stone
set
in
the
pavement
near
the
north
entrance
it
was
perforated
with
holes
in
some
of
which
were
brass
nails
many
holes
you
make
there
many
got
nails
so
many
only
three
and
a
half
nails
used
to
be
thirteen
nails
now
only
three
and
a
half
when
these
gone
then
the
world
come
to
an
end
i
it
not
berry
should
think
the
moslems
would
watch
this
stone
very
difference
you
not
it
come
when
de
time
come
we
noticed
some
pieces
of
money
on
the
stone
and
asked
why
that
was
he
lay
backsheesh
on
this
stone
he
certain
to
go
into
paradise
and
be
took
by
our
prophet
in
his
we
wandered
for
some
time
about
the
green
esplanade
dotted
with
and
admired
the
little
domes
the
dome
of
the
spirits
the
dome
that
marks
the
spot
where
david
sat
in
judgment
etc
some
of
them
cover
cisterns
and
reservoirs
in
the
rock
as
old
as
the
foundations
of
the
temple
in
the
corridor
of
the
mosque
of
aksa
are
two
columns
standing
close
together
and
like
those
at
the
mosque
of
omar
in
cairo
they
are
a
test
of
character
it
is
said
that
whoever
can
squeeze
between
them
is
certain
of
paradise
and
must
of
course
be
a
good
moslem
i
suppose
that
when
this
test
was
established
the
moslems
were
all
lean
a
black
stone
is
set
in
the
wall
of
the
porch
whoever
can
walk
with
closed
eyes
across
the
porch
pavement
and
put
his
finger
on
this
stone
may
be
sure
of
entering
paradise
according
to
this
criterion
the
writer
of
this
is
one
of
the
elect
of
the
mohammedan
paradise
and
his
dragoman
is
shut
out
we
were
shown
in
this
mosque
the
print
of
christ
foot
in
a
stone
and
it
is
said
that
with
faith
one
can
feel
in
it
as
he
can
in
that
of
mohammed
in
the
rock
the
real
flesh
opening
from
this
mosque
is
the
small
mosque
of
omar
on
the
spot
where
that
zealous
khalif
prayed
the
massive
pillared
substructions
under
aksa
are
supposed
by
moslems
to
be
of
solomon
time
that
wise
monarch
had
dealings
with
the
invisible
and
no
doubt
controlled
the
genii
who
went
and
came
and
built
and
delved
at
his
bidding
with
haste
and
an
air
of
mystery
drew
me
along
under
the
arches
to
the
window
in
the
south
end
and
showed
me
the
opening
of
a
passage
under
the
wall
now
half
choked
up
with
stones
this
is
the
beginning
of
a
subterranean
passage
made
by
the
prophet
solomon
that
extends
all
the
way
to
hebron
and
has
an
issue
in
the
mosque
over
the
tomb
of
abraham
this
fact
is
known
only
to
moslems
and
to
very
few
of
them
and
is
considered
one
of
the
great
secrets
before
i
was
admitted
to
share
it
i
am
glad
that
i
passed
between
the
two
columns
and
touched
with
my
eyes
shut
the
black
stone
in
the
southeast
corner
of
the
harem
is
a
little
building
called
the
mosque
of
jesus
we
passed
through
it
and
descended
the
stairway
into
what
is
called
solomon
stables
being
shown
on
our
way
a
stone
trough
which
is
said
to
be
the
cradle
of
the
infant
jesus
these
stables
are
subterranean
vaults
built
no
doubt
to
sustain
the
south
end
of
the
temple
platform
we
saw
fifteen
rows
of
massive
square
pillars
of
unequal
sizes
and
at
unequal
distances
apart
as
if
intended
for
supports
that
would
not
be
seen
and
some
forty
feet
high
connected
by
round
arches
we
were
glad
to
reascend
from
this
wet
and
unpleasant
cavern
to
the
sunshine
and
the
greensward
i
forgot
to
mention
the
well
of
the
leaf
near
the
entrance
in
the
mosque
of
aksa
and
the
pretty
moslem
legend
that
gave
it
a
name
which
relates
though
not
in
the
words
of
the
well
berry
old
call
him
well
of
the
leaf
water
same
as
pool
of
solomon
healthy
water
i
like
him
very
much
not
so
deep
as
bir
that
small
well
you
see
it
under
the
rock
they
say
it
goes
down
into
is
this
called
the
well
of
the
leaf
time
of
suleiman
it
was
omar
a
friend
of
our
prophet
come
here
to
pray
and
when
he
draw
water
to
wash
he
drop
the
bucket
in
the
bottom
of
the
well
no
way
to
get
it
up
but
he
must
go
down
when
he
was
on
the
bottom
there
he
much
surprised
by
a
door
open
in
the
ground
and
him
berry
to
see
what
it
is
nobody
there
so
he
look
in
and
then
walk
through
berry
fast
and
look
over
him
shoulder
to
the
bucket
left
in
the
well
the
place
where
he
was
come
was
the
most
beautiful
garden
ever
was
and
he
walk
long
time
and
find
no
end
always
more
garden
so
cool
and
water
run
in
little
streams
and
sweet
smell
of
roses
and
jasmine
and
little
birds
that
sing
and
big
trees
and
dates
and
oranges
and
palms
more
kind
i
than
you
see
in
the
garden
of
his
when
the
man
have
been
long
time
in
the
garden
he
begin
to
have
fright
and
pick
a
green
leaf
off
a
tree
and
run
back
and
come
up
to
his
friends
he
show
the
green
leaf
but
nobody
have
believe
what
he
say
then
they
tell
him
story
to
the
kadi
and
the
kadi
send
men
to
see
the
garden
in
the
bottom
of
the
well
they
not
find
any
not
find
any
door
then
the
kadi
he
make
him
a
letter
to
the
wise
he
say
so
i
read
it
in
our
history
prophet
say
one
of
my
friends
shall
walk
in
paradise
while
he
is
alive
if
this
is
come
true
you
shall
see
the
leaf
if
it
still
keep
green
then
the
kadi
make
examine
of
the
leaf
and
find
him
green
so
it
is
believe
the
man
has
been
in
do
you
believe
it
can
not
say
edzacly
where
him
been
where
you
he
done
got
that
leaf
along
the
east
wall
of
the
harem
there
are
no
remains
of
the
long
colonnade
called
solomon
porch
not
a
column
of
that
resplendent
marble
pavilion
which
caught
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
over
the
mountains
of
moab
and
which
with
the
shining
temple
towering
behind
it
must
have
presented
a
more
magnificent
appearance
than
babylon
and
have
rivalled
the
architectural
glories
of
baalbek
the
only
thing
in
this
wail
worthy
of
note
now
is
the
golden
gate
an
entrance
no
longer
used
we
descended
into
its
archways
and
found
some
fine
columns
with
composite
capitals
and
other
florid
of
a
rather
tasteless
and
debased
roman
style
we
climbed
the
wall
by
means
of
the
steps
a
series
of
which
are
placed
at
intervals
and
sat
a
long
time
looking
upon
a
landscape
every
foot
of
which
is
historical
merely
to
look
upon
it
is
to
recall
a
great
portion
of
the
jewish
history
and
the
momentous
events
in
the
brief
life
of
the
saviour
which
brief
as
it
was
sufficed
to
newly
create
the
earth
there
is
the
mount
of
olives
with
its
commemorative
chapels
heaps
of
stone
and
scattered
trees
there
is
the
ancient
up
which
david
fled
as
a
fugitive
by
night
from
the
conspiracy
of
absalom
what
time
shimei
the
relative
of
saul
stoned
him
and
cursed
him
and
down
that
way
of
triumph
the
old
road
sweeping
round
its
base
came
the
procession
of
the
son
of
david
in
whose
path
the
multitude
cast
their
garments
and
branches
of
trees
and
cried
in
the
there
on
those
hills
mount
scopus
and
olivet
were
once
encamped
the
assyrians
and
again
the
persians
there
shone
the
eagles
of
rome
borne
by
her
conquering
legions
and
there
in
turn
crusaders
and
saracens
pitched
their
tents
how
many
times
has
the
air
been
darkened
with
missiles
hurled
thence
upon
this
shining
prize
and
how
many
armies
have
closed
in
about
this
spot
and
swarmed
to
its
destruction
there
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
curves
down
until
it
is
merged
in
the
valley
of
the
brook
kidron
there
at
the
junction
of
the
roads
that
run
over
and
around
olivet
is
a
clump
of
trees
surrounded
by
a
white
wall
that
is
the
garden
of
gethsemane
near
it
is
the
tomb
of
mary
farther
down
you
see
the
tomb
of
absalom
the
tomb
of
james
the
monolith
tomb
of
zacharias
none
of
them
apparently
as
old
as
they
claim
to
be
and
the
remains
of
a
little
temple
the
model
of
which
came
from
the
banks
of
the
nile
that
solomon
built
for
his
egyptian
wife
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
wherein
they
worshipped
the
gods
of
her
country
it
is
tradition
also
that
near
here
were
some
of
the
temples
he
built
for
others
of
his
strange
wives
a
temple
to
chemosh
the
moabite
god
and
the
image
of
moloch
the
devourer
of
children
solomon
was
wiser
than
all
men
wiser
than
heman
and
chalcol
and
darda
the
sons
of
mahol
his
friend
hiram
of
tyre
used
to
send
riddles
to
him
which
no
one
in
the
world
but
solomon
could
guess
but
his
wisdom
failed
him
with
the
other
sex
and
there
probably
never
was
another
oriental
court
so
completely
ruled
and
ruined
by
women
as
his
this
valley
below
us
is
perhaps
the
most
melancholy
on
earth
nowhere
else
is
death
so
visibly
master
of
the
scene
nature
is
worn
out
man
tired
out
a
gray
despair
has
settled
down
upon
the
landscape
down
there
is
the
village
of
siloam
a
village
of
huts
and
holes
in
the
rocks
opposite
the
cave
of
that
name
if
it
were
the
abode
of
wolves
it
would
have
a
better
character
than
it
has
now
there
is
the
grim
cast
of
sin
and
exhaustion
upon
the
scene
i
do
not
know
exactly
how
much
of
this
is
owing
to
the
jewish
which
occupies
so
much
of
the
opposite
hill
the
slope
is
thickly
shingled
with
gray
stones
that
lie
in
a
sort
of
regularity
which
suggests
their
purpose
you
fall
to
computing
how
many
jews
there
may
be
in
that
hill
layer
upon
layer
for
the
most
part
they
are
dissolved
away
into
the
earth
but
you
think
that
if
they
were
to
put
on
their
mortal
bodies
and
come
forth
the
valley
itself
would
be
filled
with
them
almost
to
the
height
of
the
wall
out
of
these
gates
giving
upon
this
valley
of
death
six
hundred
thousand
bodies
of
those
who
had
starved
were
thrown
during
the
siege
and
long
before
titus
stormed
the
city
i
do
not
wonder
that
the
moslems
think
of
this
frightful
vale
as
gehenna
itself
from
an
orifice
in
the
battlemented
wall
where
we
sat
projects
a
round
column
mounted
there
like
a
cannon
and
perhaps
intended
to
deceive
an
enemy
into
the
belief
that
the
wall
is
fortified
it
is
astride
this
column
overhanging
this
dreadful
valley
that
mohammed
will
sit
at
the
last
the
judgment
day
a
line
finer
than
a
hair
and
sharper
than
a
razor
will
reach
from
it
to
the
tower
on
the
mount
of
olives
stretching
over
the
valley
of
the
dead
this
is
the
line
mohammed
will
superintend
the
passage
over
it
for
in
that
day
all
who
ever
lived
risen
to
judgment
must
walk
this
the
good
will
cross
in
safety
the
bad
will
fall
into
hell
that
is
into
gehenna
this
blasted
gulf
and
below
thickly
sown
with
departed
jews
it
is
in
view
of
this
perilous
passage
that
the
moslem
every
day
during
the
ablution
of
his
feet
prays
make
my
feet
not
to
slip
on
on
that
day
when
feet
shall
of
jerusalem
wherever
we
come
upon
traces
of
the
knights
of
john
there
a
door
opens
for
us
into
romance
the
very
name
suggests
valor
and
courtesy
and
charity
every
town
in
the
east
that
is
so
fortunate
as
to
have
any
memorials
of
them
whatever
its
other
historic
associations
obtains
an
additional
and
special
fame
from
its
connection
with
this
heroic
order
the
city
of
acre
recalls
the
memory
of
their
useless
prowess
in
the
last
struggle
of
the
christians
to
retain
a
foothold
in
palestine
the
name
of
the
knights
of
rhodes
brings
before
every
traveller
who
has
seen
it
the
picturesque
city
in
which
the
armorial
insignia
of
this
order
have
for
him
a
more
living
interest
than
any
antiquities
of
the
grecian
rose
the
island
fortress
at
the
gate
of
the
levant
owes
all
the
interest
we
feel
in
it
to
the
knights
of
malta
and
even
the
city
of
david
and
of
the
messiah
has
an
added
lustre
as
the
birthplace
of
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
from
the
eleventh
century
to
the
fifteenth
they
are
the
chief
figures
who
in
that
whirlwind
of
war
contested
the
possession
of
the
levant
with
the
saracens
and
the
turks
in
the
forefront
of
every
battle
was
seen
their
burnished
mail
in
the
gloomy
rear
of
every
retreat
were
heard
their
voices
of
constancy
and
of
courage
wherever
there
were
crowns
to
be
cracked
or
wounds
to
be
bound
up
or
broken
hearts
to
be
ministered
to
there
were
the
knights
of
john
soldiers
priests
servants
laying
aside
the
gown
for
the
coat
of
mail
if
need
be
or
exchanging
the
cuirass
for
the
white
cross
on
the
breast
originally
a
charitable
order
dwelling
in
the
hospital
of
john
to
minister
to
the
pilgrims
to
jerusalem
and
composed
of
young
soldiers
of
godfrey
who
took
the
vows
of
poverty
chastity
and
obedience
they
resumed
their
arms
upon
the
pressure
of
infidel
hostility
and
subsequently
divided
the
order
into
three
classes
soldiers
priests
and
servants
they
speedily
acquired
great
power
and
wealth
their
palaces
their
fortifications
their
churches
are
even
in
their
ruins
the
admiration
and
wonder
of
our
age
the
purity
of
the
order
was
in
time
somewhat
sullied
by
luxury
but
their
valor
never
suffered
the
slightest
eclipse
whether
the
field
they
contested
was
lost
or
won
their
bravery
always
got
new
honor
from
it
nearly
opposite
the
court
of
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
is
the
green
field
of
muristan
the
site
of
the
palace
church
and
hospital
of
the
knights
of
john
the
field
was
on
an
average
feet
above
the
surrounding
streets
and
a
portion
of
it
was
known
to
rest
upon
vaults
this
plot
of
ground
was
given
to
the
prussian
government
and
its
agents
have
been
making
excavations
there
these
were
going
on
at
the
time
of
our
visit
the
disclosures
are
of
great
architectural
and
historical
interest
the
entrance
through
a
peculiar
gothic
gateway
leads
into
a
court
here
the
first
excavations
were
made
several
years
ago
and
disclosed
some
splendid
remains
the
apse
of
the
costly
church
cloisters
fine
windows
and
arches
of
the
best
gothic
style
beyond
the
diggings
have
brought
to
light
some
of
the
features
of
the
palace
and
hospital
an
excavation
of
feet
reaches
down
to
the
arches
of
the
substructure
which
rest
upon
pillars
from
forty
to
fifty
feet
high
this
gives
us
some
notion
of
the
magnificent
group
of
buildings
that
once
occupied
this
square
and
also
of
the
industry
of
nature
as
an
entomber
since
some
four
centuries
have
sufficed
her
to
bury
these
ruins
so
far
beneath
the
soil
that
peasants
ploughed
over
the
palaces
of
the
knights
without
a
suspicion
of
what
lay
beneath
in
one
corner
of
this
field
stands
a
slender
minaret
marking
the
spot
where
the
great
omar
once
said
his
prayers
four
centuries
after
this
saladin
is
said
to
have
made
his
military
headquarters
in
the
then
deserted
palace
of
the
knights
of
john
there
is
no
spot
in
jerusalem
where
one
touches
more
springs
of
romance
than
in
this
field
of
muristan
perhaps
the
most
interesting
and
doleful
walk
one
can
take
near
jerusalem
is
that
into
the
valley
of
kidron
and
through
aceldama
round
to
the
jaffa
gate
traversing
whole
valley
of
the
dead
bodies
and
of
the
ashes
in
the
cheerful
words
of
jeremiah
we
picked
our
way
through
the
filthy
streets
and
on
the
slippery
which
it
seems
dangerous
to
ride
and
is
nearly
impossible
to
walk
through
stephen
gate
near
the
gate
inside
we
turned
into
an
alley
and
climbed
a
heap
of
rubbish
to
see
a
pool
which
the
guide
insisted
upon
calling
bethesda
although
it
is
birket
israil
having
seen
many
of
these
pools
i
did
not
expect
much
but
i
was
still
disappointed
we
saw
merely
a
hole
in
the
ground
which
is
void
of
all
appearance
of
ever
having
been
even
damp
the
fact
is
we
have
come
to
jerusalem
too
late
we
ought
to
have
been
here
about
two
thousand
years
ago
the
slope
of
the
hill
outside
the
gate
is
covered
with
the
turbaned
tombs
of
moslems
we
passed
under
the
walls
and
through
this
cemetery
into
the
deep
valley
below
crossing
the
bed
of
the
brook
near
the
tombs
of
absalom
jehoshaphat
james
and
zacharias
these
all
seem
to
be
of
roman
construction
but
that
called
absalom
is
so
firmly
believed
to
be
his
that
for
centuries
every
jew
who
has
passed
it
has
cast
a
stone
at
it
and
these
pebbles
of
hate
partially
cover
it
we
also
added
to
the
heap
but
i
do
not
know
why
for
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
hate
any
one
who
has
been
dead
so
long
the
most
interesting
phenomenon
in
the
valley
is
the
fountain
of
the
virgin
or
the
fountain
of
accused
women
as
it
used
to
be
called
the
moslem
tradition
is
that
it
was
a
test
of
the
unfaithfulness
of
women
those
who
drank
of
it
and
were
guilty
died
those
who
were
innocent
received
no
harm
the
virgin
mary
herself
being
accused
accepted
this
test
drank
of
the
water
and
proved
her
chastity
since
then
the
fountain
has
borne
her
name
the
fountain
or
well
is
in
the
under
the
rocks
of
ophel
and
the
water
springs
up
in
an
artificial
cave
we
descended
some
sixteen
steps
to
a
long
chamber
arched
with
ancient
masonry
we
passed
through
that
and
descended
fourteen
steps
more
into
a
grotto
where
we
saw
the
water
flowing
in
and
escaping
by
a
subterranean
passage
about
this
fountain
were
lounging
groups
of
moslem
idlers
mostly
women
and
children
not
far
off
a
moslem
was
saying
his
prayers
prostrating
himself
before
a
we
had
difficulty
in
making
our
way
down
the
steps
so
encumbered
were
they
with
women
several
of
them
sat
upon
the
lowest
steps
in
the
damp
cavern
gossiping
filling
their
or
paddling
about
with
naked
feet
the
well
like
many
others
in
syria
is
intermittent
and
irregular
in
its
rising
and
falling
sometimes
it
is
dry
and
then
suddenly
it
bubbles
up
and
is
full
again
some
scholars
think
this
is
the
pool
bethesda
of
the
new
testament
others
think
that
bethesda
was
siloam
which
is
below
this
well
and
fed
by
it
and
would
exhibit
the
same
irregular
rising
and
falling
this
intermittent
character
john
attributed
to
an
angel
who
came
down
and
troubled
the
water
the
moslems
with
the
same
superstition
say
that
it
is
caused
by
a
dragon
who
sleeps
therein
and
checks
the
stream
when
he
wakes
on
our
way
to
the
pool
of
siloam
we
passed
the
village
of
which
is
inhabited
by
about
a
thousand
moslems
nest
of
stone
huts
and
caves
clinging
to
the
and
exactly
the
gray
color
of
its
stones
the
occupation
of
the
inhabitants
appears
to
be
begging
and
hunting
for
old
copper
coins
mites
and
other
pieces
of
jewish
money
these
relics
they
pressed
upon
us
with
the
utmost
urgency
it
was
easier
to
satisfy
the
beggars
than
the
traders
who
sallied
out
upon
us
like
hungry
wolves
from
their
caves
there
is
a
great
choice
of
disagreeable
places
in
the
east
but
i
can
not
now
think
of
any
that
i
should
not
prefer
as
a
residence
to
siloam
the
pool
of
siloam
magnified
in
my
infant
mind
as
shady
rill
is
an
unattractive
of
dirty
water
surrounded
by
modern
masonry
the
valley
here
is
very
stony
just
below
we
came
to
solomon
garden
an
arid
spot
with
patches
of
stonewalls
struggling
to
be
a
and
somewhat
green
with
lettuce
and
jerusalem
artichokes
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
quite
another
thing
when
solomon
and
some
of
his
wives
used
to
walk
here
in
the
cool
of
the
day
and
even
when
shallum
the
son
of
colhozeh
set
up
wall
of
the
pool
of
siloah
by
the
king
we
continued
on
down
to
joab
well
passing
on
the
way
tree
a
decrepit
sycamore
propped
up
by
a
stone
pillar
where
that
prophet
was
sawn
asunder
there
is
no
end
to
the
cheerful
associations
of
the
valley
the
well
of
joab
a
hundred
and
feet
deep
and
walled
and
arched
with
fine
masonry
has
a
great
appearance
of
antiquity
we
plucked
maidenhair
from
its
crevices
and
read
the
old
testament
references
near
it
is
a
square
pool
fed
by
its
water
some
little
distance
below
this
the
waters
of
all
these
wells
pools
drains
sinks
or
whatever
they
are
reappear
bursting
up
through
a
basin
of
sand
and
pebbles
as
clear
as
crystal
and
run
brawling
off
down
the
valley
under
a
grove
of
large
scene
rural
and
inviting
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
trace
the
whole
system
of
underground
water
ways
and
cisterns
from
solomon
pool
which
send
its
water
into
town
by
an
aqueduct
near
the
jaffa
gate
to
hezekiah
pool
to
the
cisterns
under
the
harem
and
so
out
to
the
virgin
well
the
pool
of
siloam
and
the
final
gush
of
sweet
water
below
this
valley
drains
probably
artificially
as
well
as
naturally
the
whole
city
for
no
sewers
exist
in
the
latter
we
turned
back
from
this
sparkling
brook
which
speedily
sinks
into
the
ground
again
absorbed
by
the
thirsty
part
of
the
valley
called
tophet
and
went
up
the
valley
of
hinnom
passing
under
the
dark
and
frowning
ledges
of
aceldama
with
tombs
in
this
of
a
grim
stone
structure
forms
the
front
of
a
natural
cave
which
is
the
where
the
dead
were
cast
in
the
belief
that
the
salts
in
the
earth
would
speedily
consume
them
the
path
we
travel
is
rugged
steep
and
incredibly
stony
the
whole
of
this
region
is
inexpressibly
desolate
pale
uncanny
the
height
above
this
rocky
terrace
stuffed
with
the
dead
is
the
hill
of
evil
counsel
where
the
jews
took
counsel
against
jesus
and
to
add
the
last
touch
of
an
harmonious
picture
just
above
this
potter
field
stands
the
accursed
tree
upon
which
judas
hanged
himself
raising
its
gaunt
branches
against
the
twilight
sky
a
very
to
the
imagination
it
has
borne
no
fruit
since
iscariot
towards
dusk
sometimes
as
you
stand
on
the
wall
by
zion
gate
you
almost
fancy
you
can
see
him
dangling
there
it
is
of
no
use
to
tell
me
that
the
seed
that
raised
this
tree
could
not
have
sprouted
till
a
thousand
years
after
judas
was
crumbled
into
dust
one
must
have
faith
in
something
this
savage
gorge
for
the
valley
of
hinnom
is
little
more
than
that
in
its
narrowest
part
has
few
associations
that
are
not
horrible
here
solomon
set
up
the
images
groves
or
the
graven
images
and
the
temples
for
the
lascivious
rites
of
or
the
human
sacrifices
to
moloch
here
the
jews
the
kings
and
successors
of
solomon
with
a
few
exceptions
and
save
an
occasional
spasmodic
sacrifice
to
jehovah
when
calamity
made
them
fear
him
practised
all
the
abominations
of
idolatry
in
use
in
that
age
the
jews
had
always
been
more
or
less
addicted
to
the
worship
of
the
god
of
ammon
but
solomon
first
formally
established
it
in
hinnom
jeremiah
writes
of
it
historically
have
built
the
high
places
of
tophet
which
is
in
the
valley
of
the
son
of
hinnom
to
burn
their
sons
and
their
daughters
in
the
this
moloch
was
as
ingenious
a
piece
of
cruelty
as
ever
tried
the
faith
of
heretics
in
later
times
and
since
it
was
purely
a
means
of
human
sacrifice
and
not
a
means
of
grace
as
inquisitorial
tortures
were
supposed
to
be
its
use
is
conclusive
proof
of
the
savage
barbarity
of
the
people
who
delighted
in
it
moloch
was
the
monstrous
brass
image
of
a
man
with
the
head
of
an
ox
it
was
hollow
and
the
interior
contained
a
furnace
by
which
the
statue
was
made
offerings
to
the
then
placed
in
its
glowing
arms
and
drums
were
beaten
to
drown
their
cries
it
is
painful
to
recall
these
things
but
the
traveller
should
always
endeavor
to
obtain
the
historical
flavor
of
the
place
he
visits
continuing
our
walks
among
the
antiquities
of
jerusalem
we
went
out
of
the
damascus
gate
a
noble
battlemented
structure
through
which
runs
the
great
northern
highway
to
samaria
and
damascus
the
road
however
is
a
mere
path
over
ledges
and
through
loose
stones
fit
only
for
donkeys
if
rehoboam
went
this
way
in
his
chariot
to
visit
jeroboam
in
samaria
there
must
have
existed
then
a
better
road
or
else
the
king
endured
hard
pounding
for
the
sake
of
the
dignity
of
his
conveyance
as
soon
as
we
left
the
gate
we
encountered
hills
of
stones
and
paths
of
the
roughest
description
there
are
several
rock
tombs
on
this
side
of
the
city
but
we
entered
only
one
that
called
by
some
the
tombs
of
the
kings
and
by
others
with
more
reason
the
tomb
of
helena
a
heathen
convert
to
judaism
who
built
this
sepulchre
for
herself
early
in
the
first
century
the
tomb
excavated
entirely
in
the
solid
rock
is
a
spacious
affair
having
a
large
court
and
ornamented
vestibule
and
many
chambers
extending
far
into
the
rock
and
a
singular
network
of
narrow
passages
and
recesses
for
the
deposit
of
the
dead
it
had
one
device
that
is
worthy
of
the
ancient
egyptians
the
entrance
was
closed
by
a
heavy
square
stone
so
hung
that
it
would
yield
to
pressure
from
without
but
would
swing
to
its
place
by
its
own
weight
and
fitted
so
closely
that
it
could
not
be
moved
from
the
inside
if
any
thief
entered
the
tomb
and
left
this
slab
unsecured
he
would
be
instantly
caught
in
the
trap
and
become
a
permanent
occupant
large
as
the
tomb
is
its
execution
is
mean
compared
with
the
rock
tombs
of
egypt
but
the
exterior
stone
of
the
court
from
its
exposure
in
this
damp
and
variable
climate
appears
older
than
egyptian
work
which
has
been
uncovered
three
times
as
long
at
the
tomb
we
encountered
a
dozen
students
from
the
latin
convent
fellows
in
long
gowns
red
caps
and
red
sashes
they
sat
upon
the
grass
on
the
brink
of
the
excavation
stringing
rosaries
and
singing
student
songs
with
evident
enjoyment
of
the
hour
freedom
from
the
school
they
not
only
made
a
picturesque
appearance
but
they
impressed
us
also
as
a
jerusalem
group
which
was
neither
sinful
nor
dirty
beyond
this
tomb
we
noticed
a
handsome
modern
you
see
others
on
various
eminences
outside
the
city
and
we
noted
them
as
the
most
encouraging
sign
of
prosperity
about
jerusalem
we
returned
over
the
hill
and
by
the
city
wall
passing
the
cave
of
jeremiah
and
the
door
in
the
wall
that
opens
into
the
stone
quarries
of
solomon
these
quarries
underlie
a
considerable
portion
of
the
city
and
furnished
the
stone
for
its
ancient
buildings
i
will
not
impose
upon
you
a
description
of
them
for
it
would
be
unfair
to
send
you
into
disagreeable
places
that
i
did
not
explore
myself
the
grotto
of
jeremiah
is
a
natural
cavern
in
the
rocky
hill
vast
in
extent
i
think
thirty
feet
high
and
a
hundred
feet
long
by
seventy
broad
big
as
a
church
the
tradition
is
that
jeremiah
lived
and
lamented
here
in
front
of
the
cave
are
cut
stones
and
pieces
of
polished
columns
built
into
walls
and
seats
these
fragments
seem
to
indicate
the
former
existence
here
of
a
roman
temple
the
cave
is
occupied
by
an
old
dervish
who
has
a
house
in
a
rock
near
by
and
uses
the
cavern
as
a
cool
retreat
and
a
stable
for
his
donkey
his
rocky
home
is
shared
by
his
wife
and
family
he
said
that
it
was
better
to
live
alone
apart
from
the
world
and
its
snares
he
however
finds
the
reputation
of
jeremiah
profitable
selling
admission
to
the
cave
at
a
franc
a
head
and
judging
by
the
women
and
children
about
him
he
seemed
to
have
family
enough
not
to
be
lonely
the
sojourner
in
jerusalem
who
does
not
care
for
antiquities
can
always
entertain
himself
by
a
study
of
the
pilgrims
who
throng
the
city
at
this
season
we
hear
more
of
the
pilgrimage
to
mecca
than
of
that
to
jerusalem
but
i
think
the
latter
is
the
more
remarkable
phenomenon
of
our
modern
life
i
believe
it
equals
the
former
which
is
usually
overrated
in
numbers
and
it
certainly
equals
it
in
zeal
and
surpasses
it
in
the
variety
of
nationalities
represented
the
pilgrims
of
the
cross
increase
yearly
to
supply
their
wants
to
minister
to
their
credulity
to
traffic
on
their
faith
is
the
great
business
of
the
holy
city
few
i
imagine
who
are
not
in
palestine
in
the
spring
have
any
idea
of
the
extent
of
this
vast
yearly
movement
of
christian
people
upon
the
holy
land
or
of
the
simple
zeal
which
characterizes
it
if
it
were
in
any
way
obstructed
or
hindered
we
should
have
a
repetition
of
the
crusades
on
a
vaster
scale
and
gathered
from
a
broader
area
than
the
wildest
pilgrimage
of
the
holy
war
the
driblets
of
travel
from
america
and
from
western
europe
are
as
nothing
in
the
crowds
thronging
to
jerusalem
from
ethiopia
to
siberia
from
the
baltic
to
the
ural
mountains
already
for
a
year
before
the
easter
season
have
they
been
on
foot
slowly
pushing
their
way
across
great
steppes
through
snows
and
over
rivers
crossing
deserts
and
traversing
unfriendly
countries
the
old
the
infirm
women
as
well
as
men
their
faces
set
towards
jerusalem
no
common
curiosity
moves
this
mass
from
ethiopia
from
egypt
from
russia
from
european
turkey
from
asia
minor
from
the
banks
of
the
tagus
and
the
araxes
it
is
a
true
pilgrimage
of
faith
the
one
event
in
a
life
of
dull
monotony
and
sordid
cares
the
one
ecstasy
of
poetry
in
an
existence
of
poverty
and
ignorance
we
spent
a
morning
in
the
russian
hospice
which
occupies
the
hill
to
the
northwest
of
the
city
it
is
a
fine
pile
of
buildings
the
most
conspicuous
of
which
on
account
of
its
dome
is
the
church
a
large
edifice
with
a
showy
exterior
but
of
no
great
merit
or
interest
we
were
shown
some
holy
pictures
which
are
set
in
frames
incrusted
with
diamonds
emeralds
rubies
and
other
precious
gems
the
offerings
of
rich
devotees
and
displaying
their
wealth
rather
than
their
taste
the
establishment
has
one
building
for
the
accommodation
of
rich
pilgrims
and
a
larger
one
set
apart
for
peasants
the
hospice
lodges
free
of
charge
all
the
russian
pilgrims
the
exterior
court
was
full
of
them
they
were
sunning
themselves
but
not
inclined
to
lay
aside
their
hot
furs
and
heavy
woollens
we
passed
into
the
interior
entering
room
after
room
occupied
by
the
pilgrims
who
regarded
our
intrusion
with
indifference
or
frankly
returned
our
curiosity
some
of
the
rooms
were
large
furnished
with
broad
divans
about
the
sides
which
served
for
beds
and
and
were
occupied
by
both
sexes
the
women
broad
creatures
were
mending
their
clothes
the
men
were
snoozing
on
the
divans
flat
on
their
backs
presenting
to
the
spectator
the
bottoms
of
their
monstrous
shoes
which
had
soles
eight
inches
broad
a
side
of
leather
would
be
needed
for
a
pair
in
these
not
very
savory
rooms
they
cook
eat
and
sleep
here
stood
their
stoves
here
hung
their
pilgrim
knapsacks
here
were
their
kits
of
shoemaker
tools
for
mending
their
which
they
had
tugged
thousands
of
miles
here
were
household
effects
that
made
their
march
appear
more
like
an
emigration
than
a
pilgrimage
here
were
the
staring
pictures
of
george
and
the
dragon
and
of
other
saints
the
beads
and
the
other
relics
which
they
had
bought
in
jerusalem
although
all
these
pilgrims
owed
allegiance
to
the
czar
they
represented
a
considerable
variety
of
races
they
came
from
archangel
from
tobolsk
from
the
banks
of
the
ural
from
kurland
they
had
found
their
way
along
the
danube
the
dnieper
the
don
i
spoke
with
a
group
of
men
and
women
who
had
walked
over
two
thousand
miles
before
they
reached
odessa
and
took
ship
for
jaffa
there
were
among
them
cossacks
wild
and
untidy
barbarians
from
the
caucasus
men
and
women
from
moscow
representatives
from
the
remotest
provinces
of
great
russia
for
the
most
part
simple
rude
clumsy
honest
boors
in
an
interior
court
we
found
men
and
women
seated
on
the
sunny
flagging
busily
occupied
in
arranging
and
packing
the
souvenirs
of
their
visit
there
was
rosemary
spread
out
to
dry
there
were
little
round
cakes
of
blessed
bread
stamped
with
the
image
of
the
saviour
there
were
branches
of
palm
crowns
of
thorns
and
stalks
of
cane
cut
at
the
jordan
there
were
tin
cases
of
jordan
water
there
were
long
strips
of
cotton
cloth
stamped
in
black
with
various
insignia
of
death
to
serve
at
home
for
there
were
in
red
yellow
and
white
also
stamped
with
holy
images
to
be
put
on
the
heads
of
the
dead
i
could
not
but
in
mind
follow
these
people
to
their
distant
homes
and
think
of
the
pride
with
which
they
would
show
these
trophies
of
their
pilgrimage
how
the
rude
neighbors
would
handle
with
awe
a
stick
cut
on
the
banks
of
the
jordan
or
eat
with
faith
a
bit
of
the
holy
bread
how
sacred
in
those
homes
of
frost
and
snow
will
not
these
mementos
of
a
land
of
sun
of
a
land
so
sacred
become
i
can
see
the
wooden
chest
in
the
cabin
where
the
rosemary
will
be
treasured
keeping
sweet
against
the
day
of
need
the
caps
and
the
shrouds
these
people
will
need
to
make
a
good
many
more
pilgrimages
and
perhaps
to
quit
their
morose
land
altogether
before
they
can
fairly
rank
among
the
civilized
of
the
earth
they
were
thickset
unintelligent
the
faces
of
many
of
them
were
worn
as
if
and
some
kept
their
eyes
half
closed
as
if
they
were
long
used
to
face
the
sleet
and
blasts
of
winter
and
i
noticed
that
it
gave
their
faces
a
very
different
expression
from
that
produced
by
the
habit
the
egyptians
have
of
drawing
the
eyelids
close
together
on
account
of
the
glare
of
the
sun
we
took
donkeys
one
lovely
morning
and
rode
from
the
jaffa
gate
around
the
walls
on
our
way
to
the
mount
of
olives
the
jerusalem
donkey
is
a
good
enough
donkey
but
he
wo
go
he
is
ridden
with
a
halter
and
never
so
elegantly
caparisoned
as
his
more
genteel
brother
in
cairo
in
order
to
get
him
along
at
all
it
needs
one
man
to
pull
the
halter
and
another
to
follow
behind
with
a
stick
the
donkey
then
moves
by
inches
he
is
in
the
humor
the
animal
that
i
rode
stopped
at
once
when
he
perceived
that
his
driver
was
absent
no
persuasions
of
mine
such
as
kicks
and
whacks
of
a
heavy
stick
could
move
him
on
he
would
turn
out
of
the
road
put
his
head
against
the
wall
and
pretend
to
go
to
sleep
you
would
not
suppose
it
possible
for
a
beast
to
exhibit
so
much
contempt
for
a
man
on
the
high
ground
outside
the
wall
were
pitched
the
tents
of
travellers
making
a
very
pretty
effect
amid
the
and
the
gray
rocks
now
and
then
an
arab
horseman
came
charging
down
the
road
or
a
turkish
official
cantered
by
women
veiled
clad
in
white
balloon
robes
that
covered
them
from
head
to
foot
flitted
along
in
the
sunshine
mere
white
appearances
of
women
to
whom
it
was
impossible
to
attribute
any
such
errand
as
going
to
market
they
seemed
always
to
be
going
to
or
returning
from
the
cemetery
our
way
lay
down
the
rough
path
and
the
winding
road
to
the
bottom
of
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
leaving
the
garden
of
gethsemane
on
our
right
we
climbed
up
the
rugged
stony
steep
path
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
there
are
a
few
on
the
way
enough
to
hinder
the
view
where
the
would
permit
us
to
see
anything
importunate
begging
moslems
beset
us
all
along
the
route
we
encountered
shabbiness
and
squalor
the
rural
sweetness
and
peace
that
we
associate
with
this
dear
mount
appear
to
have
been
worn
away
centuries
ago
we
did
not
expect
too
much
but
we
were
not
prepared
for
such
a
shabby
if
we
could
sweep
away
all
the
filthy
habitations
and
hideous
buildings
on
the
hill
and
leave
it
to
nature
or
indeed
convert
the
surface
into
a
garden
the
spot
would
be
one
of
the
most
attractive
in
the
world
we
hoped
that
when
we
reached
the
summit
we
should
come
into
an
open
green
and
shady
place
free
from
the
disagreeable
presence
of
human
greed
and
all
the
artificiality
that
interposed
itself
between
us
and
the
sentiment
of
the
place
but
the
traveller
need
not
expect
that
in
palestine
everything
is
staked
out
and
made
a
show
of
arrived
at
the
summit
we
could
see
little
or
nothing
it
is
crowned
with
the
dilapidated
chapel
of
the
ascension
we
entered
a
dirty
court
where
the
custodian
and
his
family
and
his
animals
live
and
from
thence
were
admitted
to
the
church
in
the
pavement
is
shown
the
footprint
of
our
ascending
lord
although
the
ascension
was
made
at
bethany
we
paid
the
custodian
for
permission
to
see
this
manufactured
scene
of
the
ascension
the
best
point
of
view
to
be
had
here
is
the
old
tower
of
the
deserted
convent
or
the
narrow
passage
to
it
on
the
wall
or
the
top
of
the
minaret
near
the
church
there
is
no
place
on
wall
or
tower
where
one
can
sit
there
is
no
place
anywhere
here
to
sit
down
and
in
peace
and
quiet
enjoy
the
magnificent
prospect
and
meditate
on
the
most
momentous
event
in
human
history
we
snatched
the
view
in
the
midst
of
annoyances
the
most
minute
features
of
it
are
known
to
every
one
who
reads
the
portion
of
it
i
did
not
seem
to
have
been
long
familiar
with
is
that
to
the
east
comprising
the
jordan
valley
the
mountains
of
moab
and
the
dead
sea
although
this
mount
is
consecrated
by
the
frequent
presence
of
christ
who
so
often
crossed
it
in
going
to
and
from
bethany
and
retired
here
to
meditate
and
to
commune
with
his
loved
followers
everything
that
the
traveller
at
present
encounters
on
its
summit
is
out
of
sympathy
with
his
memory
we
escaped
from
the
beggars
and
the
showmen
climbed
some
and
in
a
rough
field
near
the
brow
of
the
hill
in
a
position
neither
comfortable
nor
private
but
the
best
that
we
found
read
the
chief
events
in
the
life
of
christ
connected
with
this
mount
the
triumphal
entry
and
the
last
scenes
transacted
on
yonder
hill
and
we
endeavored
to
make
the
divine
man
live
again
who
so
often
and
so
sorrowfully
regarded
the
then
shining
city
of
zion
from
this
height
to
the
south
of
the
church
and
a
little
down
the
hill
is
the
site
of
the
giving
of
the
lord
prayer
i
do
not
know
on
what
authority
it
is
thus
named
a
chapel
is
built
to
mark
the
spot
and
a
considerable
space
is
enclosed
before
it
in
which
are
other
objects
of
interest
and
these
were
shown
to
us
by
a
lady
who
is
connected
with
the
convent
and
has
faith
equal
to
the
demands
of
her
position
we
first
entered
a
subterranean
vaulted
room
with
twelve
rough
on
each
side
called
the
room
where
the
apostles
composed
the
creed
we
then
passed
into
the
chapel
upon
the
four
walls
of
its
arcade
is
written
in
great
characters
the
lord
prayer
in
languages
among
them
the
in
a
little
side
chapel
is
the
tomb
of
aurelia
de
bossa
princesse
de
la
tour
duchesse
de
bouillon
the
lady
whose
munificence
established
this
chapel
and
executed
the
prayer
in
so
many
tongues
upon
the
side
of
the
tomb
this
fact
of
her
benevolence
is
announced
and
the
expectation
is
also
expressed
in
french
that
will
overwhelm
her
with
blessing
for
ever
and
ever
for
her
good
stretched
upon
the
sarcophagus
is
a
beautiful
marble
effigy
of
the
princess
the
figure
is
lovely
the
face
is
sweet
and
seraphic
and
it
is
a
perfect
likeness
of
her
ladyship
i
do
not
speak
at
random
i
happen
to
know
that
it
is
a
perfect
likeness
for
a
few
minutes
after
i
saw
it
i
met
her
in
the
corridor
in
a
costume
with
a
heavy
cross
hanging
by
a
long
gold
chain
at
her
side
about
her
forehead
was
bound
a
barbarous
frontlet
composed
of
some
two
hundred
gold
coins
and
ornaments
not
unlike
those
worn
by
the
ladies
of
the
ancient
egyptians
this
incongruity
of
costume
made
me
hesitate
whether
to
recognize
in
this
dazzling
vision
of
womanhood
a
priestess
of
astarte
or
of
christ
at
the
farther
door
aurelia
de
bossa
princesse
de
la
tour
duchesse
de
bouillon
stopped
and
blew
shrilly
a
silver
whistle
which
hung
at
her
girdle
to
call
her
straying
poodle
or
to
summon
a
servant
in
the
rear
of
the
chapel
this
lady
lives
in
a
very
pretty
house
and
near
it
she
was
building
a
convent
for
carmelite
nuns
i
can
not
but
regard
her
as
the
most
fortunate
of
her
sex
she
enjoys
not
only
this
life
but
at
the
same
time
all
the
posthumous
reputation
that
a
lovely
tomb
and
a
record
of
her
munificence
engraved
thereon
can
give
we
sometimes
hear
of
but
we
seldom
see
a
person
in
these
degenerate
days
living
in
this
world
as
if
already
in
the
other
we
went
on
over
the
hill
to
bethany
we
had
climbed
up
by
the
path
on
which
david
fled
from
absalom
and
we
were
to
return
by
the
road
of
the
triumphal
entry
all
along
the
ridge
we
enjoyed
a
magnificent
panorama
a
blue
piece
of
the
dead
sea
the
jordan
plain
extending
far
up
towards
herraon
with
the
green
ribbon
of
the
river
winding
through
it
and
the
long
even
range
of
the
moab
hills
blue
in
the
distance
the
prospect
was
almost
swiss
in
its
character
but
it
is
a
mass
of
bare
hills
with
scarcely
a
tree
except
in
the
immediate
foreground
and
so
naked
and
desolate
as
to
make
the
heart
ache
it
would
be
entirely
desolate
but
for
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
and
an
atmosphere
that
bathes
all
the
great
sweep
of
peaks
and
plains
in
color
bethany
is
a
squalid
hamlet
clinging
to
the
rocky
hillside
with
only
one
redeeming
feature
about
it
prospect
a
few
wretched
huts
of
stone
and
a
miserable
handful
of
moslems
occupy
this
favorite
home
and
of
our
lord
close
at
hand
by
the
roadside
cut
in
the
rock
and
reached
by
a
steep
descent
of
steps
is
the
damp
and
doubtful
tomb
of
lazarus
down
into
which
any
one
may
go
for
half
a
franc
paid
to
the
moslem
guardian
the
house
of
mary
and
martha
is
exhibited
among
the
big
rocks
and
fragments
of
walls
upon
older
foundations
loose
walls
are
laid
rudely
and
recently
patched
up
with
cut
stones
in
fragments
and
pieces
of
roman
columns
the
house
of
simon
the
leper
overlooking
the
whole
is
a
mere
heap
of
ruins
it
does
not
matter
however
that
all
these
dwellings
are
modern
this
is
bethany
and
when
we
get
away
from
its
present
wretchedness
we
remember
only
that
we
have
seen
the
very
place
that
christ
loved
we
returned
along
the
highway
of
the
entry
slowly
pausing
to
identify
the
points
of
that
memorable
progress
up
to
the
crest
where
jerusalem
broke
upon
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
whence
the
procession
coming
round
the
curve
of
the
hill
would
have
the
full
view
of
the
city
he
who
rides
that
way
has
a
grand
prospect
one
finds
jerusalem
most
poetic
when
seen
from
olivet
and
olivet
most
lovely
when
seen
from
the
distance
of
the
city
walls
at
the
foot
of
the
descent
we
turned
and
entered
the
enclosure
of
the
garden
of
gethsemane
three
enclosures
here
claim
to
be
the
real
garden
one
is
owned
by
the
greeks
another
by
the
armenians
the
third
by
the
latins
we
chose
the
last
as
it
is
the
largest
and
pleasantest
perhaps
the
garden
which
was
certainly
in
this
vicinity
once
included
them
all
after
some
delay
we
were
admitted
by
a
small
door
in
the
wall
and
taken
charge
of
by
a
latin
monk
whose
young
and
sweet
face
was
not
out
of
sympathy
with
the
place
the
garden
contains
a
few
aged
and
some
small
plots
of
earth
fenced
about
and
secured
by
locked
gates
in
which
flowers
grow
the
guardian
gave
us
some
falling
roses
and
did
what
he
could
to
relieve
the
scene
of
its
artificial
appearance
around
the
wall
inside
are
the
twelve
stations
of
the
passion
in
the
usual
tawdry
style
but
the
birds
sang
sweetly
in
the
garden
the
flowers
of
spring
were
blooming
and
hemmed
in
by
the
high
wall
we
had
some
moments
of
solemn
peace
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
a
moslem
darabooka
drum
throbbing
near
at
hand
desecrated
as
this
spot
is
and
made
cheap
by
the
petty
creations
of
superstition
one
can
not
but
feel
the
awful
significance
of
the
place
and
the
weight
of
history
crowding
upon
him
where
battles
raged
for
a
thousand
years
and
where
the
greatest
victory
of
all
was
won
when
christ
commanded
peter
to
put
up
his
sword
near
here
titus
formed
his
columns
which
stormed
the
walls
and
captured
the
heroic
city
after
its
houses
and
all
this
valley
itself
were
filled
with
jewish
dead
but
all
this
is
as
nothing
to
the
event
of
that
awful
night
when
the
servants
of
the
led
away
the
unresisting
lord
it
is
this
event
and
not
any
other
that
puts
an
immeasurable
gulf
between
this
and
all
other
cities
and
perhaps
this
difference
is
more
felt
the
farther
one
is
from
jerusalem
the
visitor
expects
too
much
he
is
unreasonably
impatient
of
the
contrast
between
the
mean
appearance
of
the
theatre
and
the
great
events
that
have
been
enacted
on
it
perhaps
he
is
not
prepared
for
the
ignorance
the
cupidity
the
credulity
the
audacious
impostures
under
christian
names
on
the
spot
where
christianity
was
born
when
one
has
exhausted
the
stock
sights
of
jerusalem
it
is
probably
the
dullest
least
entertaining
city
of
the
orient
i
mean
in
itself
for
its
pilgrims
and
its
religious
fêtes
in
the
spring
of
the
year
offer
always
some
novelties
to
the
and
besides
there
is
a
certain
melancholy
pleasure
to
be
derived
from
roaming
about
outside
the
walls
enveloped
in
a
historic
illusion
that
colors
and
clothes
the
nakedness
of
the
landscape
the
chief
business
of
the
city
and
the
region
seems
to
be
the
manufacture
of
religious
playthings
for
the
large
children
who
come
here
if
there
is
any
factory
of
relics
here
i
did
not
see
it
nor
do
i
know
whether
the
true
cross
has
still
the
power
of
growing
which
it
had
in
the
fourth
century
to
renew
itself
under
the
constant
demand
for
pieces
of
it
i
did
not
go
to
see
the
place
where
the
tree
grew
of
which
it
was
made
the
exact
spot
is
shown
in
a
greek
convent
about
a
mile
and
a
half
west
of
the
city
the
tree
is
said
to
have
been
planted
by
abraham
and
noah
this
is
evidently
an
error
it
may
have
been
planted
by
adam
and
watered
by
noah
there
is
not
much
trade
in
antiquities
in
the
city
the
shops
offer
little
to
tempt
the
copper
coins
of
the
roman
period
abound
and
are
constantly
turned
up
in
the
fields
outside
the
city
most
of
them
battered
and
defaced
beyond
recognition
jewish
mites
are
plenty
enough
but
the
silver
shekel
would
be
rare
if
the
ingenious
jews
did
not
keep
counterfeits
on
hand
the
tourist
is
waited
on
at
his
hotel
by
a
few
patient
and
sleek
sharks
with
cases
of
cheap
jewelry
and
doubtful
antiques
and
if
he
seeks
the
shops
of
the
gold
and
silver
bazaars
he
will
find
little
more
i
will
not
say
that
he
will
not
now
and
then
pick
up
a
piece
of
old
pottery
that
has
made
the
journey
from
central
asia
or
chance
upon
a
singular
stone
with
a
talismanic
inscription
the
hope
that
he
may
do
so
carries
the
traveller
through
a
great
many
eastern
slums
the
chief
shops
however
are
those
of
trinkets
manufactured
for
the
pilgrims
of
ivory
bone
camels
teeth
and
all
manner
of
nuts
and
seeds
there
are
more
than
fifty
sorts
of
beads
strung
for
profane
use
or
arranged
for
rosaries
and
some
of
them
have
pathetic
names
like
jerusalem
is
entitled
to
be
called
the
city
of
beads
there
is
considerable
activity
in
jewish
objects
that
are
old
and
rather
unclean
and
i
think
i
discovered
something
like
an
attempt
to
make
a
in
phylacteries
that
is
in
old
ones
for
the
new
are
made
in
excess
of
the
demand
if
a
person
desires
to
carry
home
a
phylactery
to
exhibit
to
his
sunday
school
in
illustration
of
the
religion
of
the
jews
he
wants
one
that
has
been
a
long
time
in
use
i
do
not
suppose
it
possible
that
the
education
of
any
other
person
is
as
deficient
as
mine
was
in
the
matter
of
these
ornamental
aids
in
worship
but
if
there
is
one
this
description
is
for
him
the
phylactery
common
size
is
a
leathern
box
about
an
inch
and
a
half
square
with
two
narrow
straps
of
leather
about
three
feet
long
sewed
to
the
bottom
corners
the
box
contains
a
parchment
roll
of
sacred
writing
when
the
worshipper
performs
his
devotions
in
the
synagogue
he
binds
one
of
the
phylacteries
about
his
left
arm
and
the
other
about
his
head
so
that
the
little
box
has
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
leathern
horn
sprouting
out
of
his
forehead
phylacteries
are
worn
only
in
the
synagogue
and
in
this
respect
differ
from
the
greasy
leathern
talismans
of
the
nubians
which
contain
scraps
from
the
koran
and
are
never
taken
off
whatever
significance
the
phylactery
once
had
to
the
jew
it
seems
now
to
have
lost
since
he
is
willing
to
make
it
an
article
of
merchandise
perhaps
it
is
poverty
that
compels
him
also
to
sell
his
ancient
scriptures
parchment
rolls
of
favorite
books
such
as
esther
that
are
some
centuries
old
are
occasionally
to
be
bought
and
new
rolls
deceitfully
doctored
into
an
appearance
of
antiquity
are
offered
freely
a
few
years
ago
the
antiquarian
world
was
put
into
a
ferment
by
what
was
called
the
collection
a
large
quantity
of
clay
pottery
votive
offerings
images
jars
and
other
vessels
inscriptions
in
unknown
characters
which
was
said
to
have
been
dug
up
in
the
land
of
moab
beyond
the
jordan
and
was
expected
to
throw
great
light
upon
certain
passages
of
jewish
history
and
especially
upon
the
religion
of
the
heathen
who
occupied
palestine
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
the
collection
was
sent
to
berlin
some
eminent
german
savans
pronounced
it
genuine
nearly
all
the
english
scholars
branded
it
as
an
impudent
imposture
two
collections
of
the
articles
have
been
sent
to
berlin
where
they
are
stored
out
of
sight
of
the
public
generally
and
shoepira
has
made
a
third
collection
which
he
still
retains
shoepira
is
a
hebrew
antiquarian
and
bookseller
of
somewhat
eccentric
manners
but
an
enthusiast
he
makes
the
impression
of
a
man
who
believes
in
his
discoveries
and
it
is
generally
thought
in
jerusalem
that
if
his
collection
is
a
forgery
he
himself
is
imposed
on
the
account
which
he
gives
of
the
places
where
the
images
and
utensils
were
found
is
anything
but
clear
or
definite
we
are
required
to
believe
that
they
have
been
dug
up
in
caves
at
night
and
by
stealth
and
at
the
peril
of
the
lives
of
the
discoverers
and
that
it
is
not
safe
to
visit
these
caves
in
the
daytime
on
account
of
the
bedaween
the
appearance
of
some
of
the
articles
is
admitted
and
it
is
said
that
it
was
necessary
to
roast
them
to
prevent
their
crumbling
when
exposed
to
the
air
our
theory
in
regard
to
these
singular
objects
is
that
a
few
of
those
first
shown
were
actually
discovered
and
that
all
the
remainder
have
been
made
in
imitation
of
them
of
the
characters
or
alphabet
of
the
inscriptions
schepira
says
he
has
determined
sixteen
of
these
are
phoenician
and
the
others
his
critics
say
are
meaningless
all
the
objects
are
exceedingly
rude
and
devoid
of
the
slightest
art
the
images
are
many
of
them
indecent
the
jars
are
clumsy
in
shape
but
the
inscriptions
are
put
on
with
some
skill
the
figures
are
supposed
to
have
been
votive
offerings
and
the
jars
either
memorial
or
sepulchral
urns
the
hideous
collection
appeared
to
me
sui
generis
although
some
of
the
images
resemble
the
rudest
of
those
called
phoenician
which
general
di
cesnola
unearthed
in
cyprus
without
merit
they
seem
to
belong
to
a
rude
age
rather
than
to
be
the
inartistic
product
of
this
age
that
is
supposing
them
to
be
forgeries
i
can
not
see
how
these
figures
could
be
conceived
by
a
modern
man
who
was
capable
of
inventing
a
fraud
of
this
sort
he
would
have
devised
something
better
at
least
something
less
simple
something
that
would
have
somewhere
betrayed
a
little
modern
knowledge
and
feeling
all
the
objects
have
the
same
barbarous
tone
a
kind
of
character
that
is
distinct
from
their
rudeness
and
the
same
images
and
designs
are
repeated
over
and
over
again
this
gives
color
to
the
theory
that
a
few
genuine
pieces
of
moabite
pottery
were
found
which
gave
the
idea
for
a
large
manufacture
of
them
and
yet
there
are
people
who
see
these
things
and
visit
all
the
holy
places
and
then
go
away
and
lament
that
there
are
no
manufactories
in
jerusalem
jerusalem
attracts
while
it
repels
and
both
it
and
all
palestine
exercise
a
spell
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
consideration
they
had
in
the
ancient
world
the
student
of
the
mere
facts
of
history
especially
if
his
studies
were
made
in
jerusalem
itself
would
be
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
place
that
the
holy
city
occupies
in
the
thought
of
the
modern
world
and
the
importance
attached
to
the
history
of
the
handful
of
people
who
made
themselves
a
home
in
this
rocky
country
the
hebrew
nation
itself
during
the
little
time
it
was
a
nation
did
not
play
a
part
in
oriental
affairs
at
all
commensurate
with
its
posthumous
reputation
it
was
not
one
of
the
great
kingdoms
of
antiquity
and
in
that
theatre
of
war
and
conquest
which
spread
from
ethiopia
to
the
caspian
sea
it
was
scarcely
an
appreciable
force
in
the
great
drama
the
country
the
hebrews
occupied
was
small
they
never
conquered
or
occupied
the
whole
of
the
promised
land
which
extended
from
the
mediterranean
sea
to
the
arabian
plain
from
hamath
to
sinai
their
territory
in
actual
possession
reached
only
from
dan
to
beersheba
the
coast
they
never
subdued
the
philistines
who
came
from
crete
and
grew
to
be
a
great
people
in
the
plain
held
the
lower
portion
of
palestine
on
the
sea
and
the
phoenicians
the
upper
except
during
a
brief
period
in
their
history
the
jews
were
confined
to
the
only
during
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
of
david
and
two
thirds
of
that
of
solomon
did
the
jewish
kingdom
take
on
the
proportions
of
a
great
state
david
extended
the
israelitish
power
from
the
gulf
of
akaba
to
the
euphrates
damascus
paid
him
tribute
he
occupied
the
cities
of
his
old
enemies
the
philistines
but
the
kingdom
of
tyre
still
in
the
possession
of
hiram
marked
the
limit
of
jewish
sway
in
that
direction
this
period
of
territorial
consequence
was
indeed
brief
before
solomon
was
in
his
grave
the
conquests
bequeathed
to
him
by
his
father
began
to
slip
from
his
hand
the
life
of
the
israelites
as
a
united
nation
as
anything
but
discordant
and
warring
tribes
after
the
death
of
joshua
is
all
included
in
the
reigns
of
david
and
solomon
sixty
or
seventy
years
the
israelites
were
essentially
highlanders
some
one
has
noticed
their
resemblance
to
the
scotch
highlanders
in
modes
of
warfare
in
fighting
they
aimed
to
occupy
the
heights
they
descended
into
the
plain
reluctantly
they
made
occasional
forays
into
the
lowlands
but
their
hills
were
their
strength
as
the
psalmist
said
and
they
found
security
among
their
crags
and
secluded
glens
from
the
agitations
which
shook
the
great
empires
of
the
eastern
world
invasions
retreats
pursuits
the
advance
of
devouring
hosts
or
the
flight
of
masses
for
a
long
time
passed
by
their
ridge
of
country
on
either
side
along
the
mediterranean
or
through
the
land
of
moab
they
were
out
of
the
track
of
oriental
commerce
as
well
as
of
war
so
removed
were
they
from
participation
in
the
stirring
affairs
of
their
era
that
they
seem
even
to
have
escaped
the
omnivorous
egyptian
conquerors
eor
a
long
period
conquest
passed
them
by
and
it
was
not
till
their
accumulation
of
wealth
tempted
the
avarice
of
the
great
asiatic
powers
that
they
were
involved
in
the
conflicts
which
finally
destroyed
them
the
small
kingdom
of
judah
long
after
that
of
israel
had
been
utterly
swept
away
owed
its
continuance
of
life
to
its
very
defensible
position
solomon
left
jerusalem
a
strong
city
well
supplied
with
water
and
capable
of
sustaining
a
long
siege
while
the
rugged
country
around
it
offered
little
comfort
to
a
besieging
army
for
a
short
time
david
made
the
name
of
israel
a
power
in
the
world
and
solomon
inheriting
his
reputation
added
the
triumphs
of
commerce
to
those
of
conquest
by
a
judicious
heathen
alliance
with
hiram
of
tyre
he
was
able
to
build
vessels
on
the
red
sea
and
man
them
with
phoenician
sailors
for
voyages
to
india
and
ceylon
and
he
was
admitted
by
hiram
to
a
partnership
in
his
trading
adventures
to
the
pillars
of
hercules
but
these
are
only
episodes
in
the
jewish
career
the
nation
part
in
oriental
history
is
comparatively
insignificant
until
the
days
of
their
great
calamities
how
much
attention
its
heroism
and
suffering
attracted
at
that
time
we
do
not
know
though
the
israelites
during
their
occupation
of
the
of
palestine
were
not
concerned
in
the
great
dynastic
struggles
of
the
orient
they
were
not
however
at
peace
either
the
tribes
were
fighting
among
themselves
or
they
were
involved
in
sanguinary
fights
with
the
petty
heathen
chiefs
about
them
we
get
a
lively
picture
of
the
habits
of
the
time
in
a
sentence
in
the
second
book
of
samuel
it
came
to
pass
after
the
year
was
expired
at
the
time
when
kings
go
forth
to
battle
that
david
sent
joab
and
his
servants
with
him
and
all
israel
and
they
destroyed
the
children
of
ammon
and
besieged
it
was
a
pretty
custom
in
that
season
when
birds
pair
and
build
their
nests
when
the
sap
mounts
in
the
trees
and
travellers
long
to
go
into
far
countries
kings
felt
a
noble
impulse
in
their
veins
to
go
out
and
fight
other
kings
but
this
primitive
simplicity
was
mingled
with
shocking
barbarity
david
once
put
his
captives
under
the
saw
and
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
the
israelites
were
more
moved
by
sentiments
of
pity
and
compassion
than
their
heathen
neighbors
there
was
occasionally
however
a
grim
humor
in
their
cruelty
when
judah
captured
king
in
bezek
he
cut
off
his
great
toes
and
his
thumbs
who
could
appreciate
a
good
thing
accepted
the
mutilation
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
offered
and
said
that
he
had
himself
served
seventy
kings
in
that
fashion
and
ten
kings
having
their
thumbs
and
great
toes
cut
off
gathered
their
meat
under
my
from
the
death
of
joshua
to
the
fall
of
samaria
the
history
of
the
jews
is
largely
a
history
of
civil
war
from
about
seven
hundred
years
before
christ
palestine
was
essentially
a
satrapy
of
the
assyrian
kings
as
it
was
later
to
become
one
of
the
small
provinces
of
the
roman
empire
at
the
time
when
sennacherib
was
waiting
before
jerusalem
for
hezekiah
to
purchase
his
withdrawal
by
stripping
the
gold
from
the
doors
of
the
temple
the
foundations
of
a
city
were
laid
on
the
banks
of
the
tiber
which
was
to
extend
its
sway
over
the
known
world
to
whose
dominion
the
utmost
power
of
jerusalem
was
only
a
petty
sovereignty
and
which
was
destined
to
rival
jerusalem
itself
as
the
spiritual
capital
of
the
earth
if
we
do
not
find
in
the
military
power
or
territorial
consequence
of
the
jews
an
explanation
of
their
influence
in
the
modern
world
still
less
do
we
find
it
in
any
faithfulness
to
a
spiritual
religion
the
knowledge
of
which
was
their
chief
distinction
among
the
tribes
about
them
their
lapses
from
the
worship
of
jehovah
were
so
frequent
and
of
such
long
duration
that
their
returns
to
the
worship
of
the
true
god
seem
little
more
than
breaks
in
their
practice
of
idolatry
and
these
spasmodic
returns
were
due
to
calamities
and
fears
of
worse
judgments
solomon
sanctioned
by
national
authority
gross
idolatries
which
had
been
long
practised
at
his
death
ten
of
the
tribes
seceded
from
the
dominion
of
judah
and
set
up
a
kingdom
in
which
idolatry
was
made
and
remained
the
state
religion
until
the
ten
tribes
vanished
from
the
theatre
of
history
the
kingdom
of
israel
in
order
to
emphasize
its
separation
from
that
of
judah
set
up
the
worship
of
jehovah
in
the
image
of
a
golden
calf
against
this
state
religion
of
the
prophets
seem
to
have
thought
it
in
vain
to
protest
they
contented
themselves
with
battling
against
the
more
gross
and
licentious
idolatries
of
baal
and
ashtaroth
and
israel
always
continued
the
established
by
jeroboam
the
worship
of
jehovah
was
the
state
religion
of
the
little
kingdom
of
judah
but
during
the
period
of
its
existence
before
the
captivity
i
think
that
only
four
of
its
kings
were
not
idolaters
the
people
were
constantly
falling
away
into
the
heathenish
practices
of
their
neighbors
if
neither
territorial
consequence
nor
religious
steadfastness
gave
the
jews
rank
among
the
great
nations
of
antiquity
they
would
equally
fail
of
the
consideration
they
now
enjoy
but
for
one
thing
and
that
is
after
all
the
chief
and
enduring
product
of
any
nationality
we
mean
of
course
its
literature
it
is
by
that
that
the
little
kingdoms
of
judah
and
israel
hold
their
sway
over
the
world
it
is
that
which
invests
ancient
jerusalem
with
its
charm
and
dignity
not
what
the
jews
did
but
the
songs
of
their
poets
the
warnings
and
lamentations
of
their
prophets
the
touching
tales
of
their
draw
us
to
jerusalem
by
the
most
powerful
influences
that
affect
the
human
mind
and
most
of
this
unequalled
literature
is
the
product
of
seasons
of
turbulence
passion
and
insecurity
except
the
proverbs
and
song
of
solomon
and
such
pieces
as
the
poem
of
job
and
the
story
of
ruth
which
seem
to
be
the
outcome
of
literary
leisure
the
hebrew
writings
were
all
the
offspring
of
exciting
periods
david
composed
his
most
marvellous
interpreters
of
every
human
aspiration
exaltation
want
and
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
the
prophets
always
appear
to
ride
upon
a
whirlwind
the
power
of
jerusalem
over
the
world
is
as
truly
a
literary
one
as
that
of
athens
is
one
of
art
that
literature
was
unknown
to
the
ancients
or
unappreciated
otherwise
contemporary
history
would
have
considered
its
creators
of
more
consequence
than
it
did
we
speak
we
have
been
speaking
of
the
jerusalem
before
our
era
and
of
the
interest
it
has
independent
of
the
great
event
which
is
after
all
its
chief
claim
to
immortal
estimation
it
becomes
sacred
ground
to
us
because
there
in
bethlehem
christ
was
born
because
in
these
streets
but
upon
this
walked
and
talked
and
taught
and
ministered
because
upon
olivet
yonder
he
often
sat
with
his
disciples
and
here
somewhere
matters
not
where
suffered
death
and
conquered
death
this
is
the
scene
of
these
transcendent
events
we
say
it
to
ourselves
while
we
stand
here
we
can
clearly
conceive
it
when
we
are
at
a
distance
but
with
the
actual
jerusalem
of
before
our
eyes
its
naked
desolation
its
superstition
its
squalor
its
vivid
contrast
to
what
we
conceive
should
be
the
city
of
our
king
we
find
it
easier
to
feel
that
christ
was
born
in
new
england
than
in
judæa
down
to
jericho
it
is
on
a
lovely
spring
morning
that
we
set
out
through
the
land
of
benjamin
to
go
down
among
the
thieves
of
jericho
and
to
the
jordan
and
the
dead
sea
for
protection
against
the
thieves
we
take
some
of
them
with
us
since
you
can
not
in
these
days
rely
upon
finding
any
good
samaritans
there
for
some
days
has
been
in
mysterious
diplomatic
relations
with
the
robbers
of
the
wilderness
who
live
in
jerusalem
and
farm
out
their
territory
is
great
rascals
says
the
dragoman
and
it
is
solely
on
that
account
that
we
seek
their
friendship
the
real
bedawee
is
never
known
to
go
back
on
his
word
to
the
traveller
who
trusts
him
so
long
as
it
is
more
profitable
to
keep
it
than
to
break
it
we
are
under
the
escort
of
the
second
sheykh
who
shares
with
the
first
sheykh
the
rule
of
all
the
bedaween
who
patrol
the
extensive
territory
from
hebron
to
the
fords
of
the
jordan
including
jerusalem
bethlehem
mar
saba
and
the
shores
of
the
dead
sea
these
rulers
would
have
been
called
kings
in
the
old
time
and
the
second
sheykh
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
first
that
the
cæsar
did
to
the
augustus
in
the
roman
empire
our
train
is
assembled
in
the
little
opposite
the
hotel
or
rather
it
is
assembling
for
horses
and
donkeys
are
slow
to
arrive
saddles
are
wanting
the
bridles
are
broken
and
the
unpunctuality
and
shiftlessness
of
the
east
manifest
themselves
is
in
fierce
altercation
with
a
koorland
nobleman
about
a
horse
which
you
would
not
say
would
be
likely
to
be
a
bone
of
contention
with
anybody
they
are
both
endeavoring
to
mount
at
once
friends
are
backing
each
combatant
and
the
air
is
thick
with
curses
in
guttural
german
and
maledictions
in
shrill
arabic
unfortunately
i
am
appealed
to
for
this
dutchman
he
take
my
horse
he
hired
it
first
not
i
make
bargain
for
him
with
the
owner
day
before
have
become
dis
pferd
for
four
days
cries
the
baron
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
to
doubt
the
baron
word
he
has
ridden
the
horse
to
bethlehem
and
become
accustomed
to
his
jolts
and
no
doubt
has
the
prior
lien
on
the
animal
the
owner
has
let
him
to
both
parties
a
thing
that
often
happens
when
the
second
comer
offers
a
piastre
more
another
horse
is
sent
for
and
we
mount
and
begin
to
disentangle
ourselves
from
the
crowd
it
is
no
easy
matter
especially
for
the
ladies
our
own
head
in
every
direction
donkeys
laden
with
mountains
of
brushwood
push
through
the
throng
scraping
right
and
left
camels
shamble
against
us
their
contemptuous
noses
in
the
air
stretching
their
long
necks
over
our
heads
from
bethlehem
scream
at
us
and
greasy
pilgrims
block
our
way
and
curse
our
hoofs
one
by
one
we
emerge
and
get
into
a
straggling
line
and
begin
to
comprehend
the
size
of
our
expedition
our
dragoman
has
made
as
extensive
preparations
as
if
we
were
to
be
the
first
to
occupy
gilgal
and
jericho
and
that
portion
of
the
promised
land
we
are
equipped
equally
well
for
fighting
and
for
famine
a
party
of
syrians
who
desire
to
make
the
pilgrimage
to
the
jordan
have
asked
permission
to
join
us
in
order
to
share
the
protection
of
our
sheykh
and
they
add
both
picturesqueness
and
strength
to
the
grand
cavalcade
which
clatters
out
of
jaffa
gate
and
sweeps
round
the
city
wall
heaven
keep
us
from
undue
pride
in
our
noble
appearance
perhaps
our
train
would
impress
a
spectator
as
somewhat
mixed
and
he
would
be
unable
to
determine
the
order
of
its
march
it
is
true
that
the
horses
and
the
donkeys
and
the
mules
all
have
different
rates
of
speed
and
that
the
syrian
horse
has
only
two
gaits
run
and
a
slow
walk
as
soon
as
we
gain
the
freedom
of
the
open
country
these
differences
develop
the
ambitious
dragomen
and
the
warlike
sheykh
put
their
horses
into
a
run
and
scour
over
the
hills
and
then
come
charging
back
upon
us
like
don
quixote
upon
the
flock
of
sheep
the
syrians
imitate
this
madness
the
other
horses
begin
to
agitate
their
stiff
legs
the
donkeys
stand
still
and
protest
by
braying
the
get
temporarily
crazy
charge
into
us
with
the
protruding
luggage
and
suddenly
wheel
into
the
ditch
and
stop
this
playfulness
is
repeated
in
various
ways
and
adds
to
the
excitement
without
improving
the
dignity
of
our
march
we
are
of
many
nationalities
there
are
four
americans
two
of
them
ladies
the
doctor
who
is
accustomed
to
ride
the
mustangs
of
new
mexico
and
the
wild
horses
of
the
western
deserts
endeavors
to
excite
a
spirit
of
emulation
in
his
animal
but
with
little
success
our
dragoman
is
egyptian
a
decidedly
heavy
weight
and
sits
his
steed
like
a
pyramid
the
sheykh
is
a
young
man
with
the
treacherous
eye
of
an
eagle
a
handsome
fellow
who
rides
a
lean
white
horse
anything
but
a
beauty
and
yet
of
the
famous
nedjed
breed
from
mecca
this
desert
warrior
wears
red
boots
white
trousers
and
skirt
blue
jacket
a
yellow
kufia
confined
about
the
head
by
a
black
cord
and
falling
upon
his
shoulders
has
a
long
rifle
slung
at
his
back
an
immense
damascus
sword
at
his
side
and
huge
pistols
with
carved
and
inlaid
stocks
in
his
belt
he
is
a
riding
arsenal
and
a
visible
fraud
this
bedawee
sheykh
we
should
no
doubt
be
quite
as
safe
without
him
and
perhaps
less
liable
to
various
extortions
but
on
the
road
and
from
the
moment
we
set
out
we
meet
bedaween
single
and
in
squads
vagabonds
every
one
armed
with
a
gun
a
long
knife
and
pistols
with
blunderbuss
barrels
flaring
in
such
a
manner
as
to
scatter
shot
over
an
acre
of
ground
these
scarecrows
are
apparently
paraded
on
the
highway
to
make
travellers
think
it
is
insecure
but
i
am
persuaded
that
none
of
them
would
dare
molest
any
pilgrim
to
the
jordan
our
allies
the
syrians
please
us
better
there
is
a
frenchified
syrian
with
his
wife
from
mansura
in
the
delta
of
egypt
the
wife
is
a
very
pretty
woman
would
that
her
example
were
more
generally
followed
in
the
east
with
olive
complexion
black
eyes
and
a
low
a
native
of
sidon
she
wears
a
dark
green
dress
and
a
yellow
kufia
on
her
head
and
is
mounted
upon
a
mule
but
upon
a
saddle
as
broad
as
a
her
husband
in
costume
with
carries
a
gun
at
his
back
and
a
frightful
knife
in
his
belt
her
brother
who
is
from
sidon
bears
also
a
gun
and
wears
an
enormous
sword
very
pleasant
people
these
who
have
armed
themselves
in
the
spirit
of
the
hunter
rather
than
of
the
warrior
and
are
as
completely
equipped
for
the
chase
as
any
parisian
who
ventures
in
pursuit
of
game
into
any
of
the
dangerous
thickets
outside
of
paris
the
sidon
wife
is
accompanied
by
two
servants
slaves
from
soudan
a
boy
and
a
girl
each
about
ten
years
old
grinning
comical
monkeys
who
could
not
by
any
possibility
be
of
the
slightest
service
to
anybody
unless
it
is
a
relief
to
their
pretty
mistress
to
vent
her
upon
their
irresponsible
persons
you
could
call
them
handsome
though
their
skins
are
of
dazzling
black
and
their
noses
so
flat
that
you
can
not
see
them
in
profile
the
girl
wears
a
silk
gown
which
reaches
to
her
feet
and
gives
her
the
quaint
appearance
of
an
old
woman
and
a
yellow
vest
the
boy
is
clad
in
motley
european
clothes
bought
with
reference
to
his
growing
up
to
them
which
event
the
and
cuffs
of
his
coat
could
be
turned
down
a
red
fez
contrasting
finely
with
his
black
face
they
are
both
mounted
on
a
decrepit
old
horse
whose
legs
are
like
and
they
sit
astride
on
top
of
a
pile
of
baggage
beds
and
furniture
with
bottles
and
jingling
about
them
the
girl
sits
behind
the
boy
and
clings
fast
to
his
waist
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
she
holds
over
their
heads
a
rent
white
parasol
to
prevent
any
injury
to
their
jet
complexions
when
the
old
starts
occasionally
into
a
hard
trot
they
both
bob
up
and
down
and
strike
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
but
never
together
when
one
goes
up
the
other
goes
down
as
if
they
were
moved
by
different
springs
but
both
show
their
ivory
and
seem
to
enjoy
themselves
heaven
knows
why
they
should
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
jordan
our
abyssinian
servant
abdallah
is
mounted
also
on
a
and
sits
high
in
the
air
amid
bags
and
bundles
he
guides
his
brute
only
by
a
halter
and
when
the
animal
takes
a
fancy
to
break
into
a
gallop
there
is
a
rattling
of
dishes
and
kettles
that
sets
the
whole
train
into
commotion
the
boy
fez
falls
farther
than
ever
back
on
his
head
his
teeth
shine
and
his
eyes
dance
as
he
jolts
into
the
midst
of
the
mules
and
excites
a
panic
which
starts
everything
into
friskiness
waking
up
even
the
soudan
party
which
begins
to
bob
about
and
grin
there
are
half
a
dozen
mules
loaded
with
tents
and
bed
furniture
the
cook
and
the
cook
assistants
and
the
servants
of
the
kitchen
and
the
camp
are
mounted
on
something
and
the
train
is
attended
besides
by
drivers
and
ostlers
of
what
nations
it
pleases
heaven
but
this
is
not
all
we
carry
with
us
two
hunting
dogs
the
property
of
the
syrian
the
dogs
are
not
for
use
they
are
a
piece
of
ostentation
like
the
other
portion
of
the
hunting
outfit
and
contribute
as
do
the
soudan
babies
to
our
appearance
of
oriental
luxury
we
straggle
down
through
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
and
around
the
mount
of
olives
to
bethany
and
from
that
sightly
slope
our
route
is
spread
before
us
as
if
we
were
looking
upon
a
map
it
lies
through
the
of
we
are
obliged
to
revise
our
western
notions
of
a
wilderness
as
a
region
of
gross
vegetation
the
jews
knew
a
wilderness
when
they
saw
it
and
how
to
name
it
you
would
be
interested
to
know
what
a
person
who
lived
at
jerusalem
or
anywhere
along
the
backbone
of
palestine
would
call
a
wilderness
nothing
but
the
absolute
nakedness
of
desolation
could
seem
to
him
dreary
but
this
region
must
have
satisfied
even
a
person
accustomed
to
deserts
and
pastures
of
rocks
it
is
a
jumble
of
savage
hills
and
jagged
ravines
a
land
of
limestone
rocks
and
ledges
whitish
gray
in
color
glaring
in
the
sun
even
the
stones
wasted
by
age
relieved
nowhere
by
a
tree
or
rejoiced
by
a
single
blade
of
grass
wild
beasts
would
starve
in
it
the
most
industrious
bird
could
collect
in
its
length
and
breadth
enough
soft
material
to
make
a
nest
of
it
is
what
a
jew
of
hebron
or
jerusalem
or
hamah
would
call
a
this
exhausts
the
language
of
description
how
vividly
in
this
desolation
stands
out
the
figure
of
the
prophet
of
god
clothed
with
camel
hair
and
with
a
girdle
of
skin
about
his
loins
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
the
road
is
thronged
with
jordan
pilgrims
we
overtake
them
they
pass
us
we
meet
them
in
an
almost
continuous
train
most
of
them
are
peasants
from
armenia
from
the
borders
of
the
black
sea
from
the
caucasus
from
abyssinia
the
great
mass
are
on
foot
trudging
wearily
along
with
their
bedding
and
provisions
the
women
carrying
the
heaviest
loads
occasionally
you
see
a
pilgrim
asleep
by
the
roadside
his
pillow
a
stone
but
the
travellers
are
by
no
means
all
poor
or
unable
to
hire
means
of
conveyance
would
say
that
judæa
had
been
exhausted
of
its
beasts
of
burden
of
all
descriptions
for
this
pilgrimage
and
that
even
the
skeletons
had
been
exhumed
to
assist
in
it
the
pilgrims
are
mounted
on
sorry
donkeys
on
wrecks
of
horses
on
mules
sometimes
an
entire
family
on
one
animal
now
and
then
we
encounter
a
outfit
a
wealthy
russian
well
mounted
on
a
richly
caparisoned
horse
and
attended
by
his
servants
some
ride
in
palanquins
some
in
chairs
we
overtake
an
english
party
the
central
figure
of
which
is
an
elderly
lady
who
rides
in
a
sort
of
high
cupboard
slung
on
poles
and
borne
by
a
mule
before
and
a
mule
behind
the
awkward
vehicle
sways
and
tilts
backwards
and
forwards
and
the
good
woman
looks
out
of
the
window
of
her
coop
as
if
she
were
of
the
world
some
ladies
who
are
unaccustomed
to
horses
have
strapped
upon
the
horses
backs
in
which
they
sit
now
and
then
two
chairs
are
strapped
upon
one
horse
and
the
riders
sit
back
to
back
sometimes
huge
panniers
slung
on
the
sides
of
the
horse
are
used
instead
of
chairs
the
passengers
riding
securely
in
them
without
any
danger
of
falling
out
it
is
rather
a
pretty
sight
when
each
basket
happens
to
be
full
of
children
there
is
indeed
no
end
to
the
strange
outfits
and
the
odd
costumes
nearly
all
the
women
who
are
mounted
at
all
are
perched
upon
the
top
of
all
their
household
goods
and
furniture
astride
of
a
bed
on
the
summit
there
approaches
a
horse
which
seems
to
have
a
sofa
on
its
back
upon
which
four
persons
are
seated
in
a
row
as
much
at
ease
as
if
at
home
it
is
not
however
a
sofa
four
baskets
have
been
ingeniously
fastened
into
a
frame
so
that
four
persons
can
ride
in
them
abreast
this
is
an
admirable
contrivance
for
the
riders
much
better
than
riding
in
a
row
lengthwise
on
the
horse
when
the
one
in
front
hides
the
view
from
those
behind
diverted
by
this
changing
spectacle
we
descend
from
bethany
at
first
there
are
by
the
wayside
and
in
the
fields
and
there
is
a
flush
of
verdure
on
the
hills
all
of
which
disappears
later
the
sky
is
deep
blue
and
cloudless
the
air
is
exhilarating
it
is
a
day
for
enjoyment
and
everything
and
everybody
we
encounter
are
in
a
joyous
mood
and
on
good
terms
with
the
world
the
only
unamiable
exception
is
the
horse
with
which
i
have
been
favored
he
is
a
stocky
little
stallion
of
good
shape
but
ignoble
breed
and
the
is
i
suppose
in
the
horse
what
the
old
adam
is
in
never
been
cast
out
of
him
at
first
i
am
in
love
with
his
pleasant
gait
and
mincing
ways
but
i
soon
find
that
he
has
eccentricities
that
require
the
closest
attention
on
my
part
and
leave
me
not
a
moment
for
the
scenery
or
for
biblical
reflections
the
beast
is
neither
content
to
go
in
front
of
the
caravan
nor
in
the
rear
he
wants
society
but
the
instant
he
gets
into
the
crowd
he
lets
his
heels
fly
right
and
left
after
a
few
performances
of
this
sort
and
when
he
has
nearly
broken
the
leg
of
the
syrian
my
company
is
not
desired
any
more
by
any
one
no
one
is
willing
to
ride
within
speaking
distance
of
me
this
sort
of
horse
may
please
the
giddy
and
thoughtless
but
he
is
not
the
animal
for
me
by
the
time
we
reach
the
fountain
i
have
quite
enough
of
him
and
exchange
steeds
with
the
dragoman
much
against
the
latter
fancy
he
keeps
the
brute
the
remainder
of
the
day
cantering
over
stones
and
waste
places
along
the
road
and
confesses
at
night
that
his
is
so
swollen
as
to
be
useless
we
descend
a
steep
hill
to
this
fountain
which
flows
from
a
broken
saracenic
arch
and
waters
a
valley
that
is
altogether
stony
and
unfertile
except
in
some
patches
of
green
it
is
a
general
for
travellers
and
presents
a
most
animated
appearance
when
we
arrive
horses
mules
and
men
are
struggling
together
about
the
fountain
to
slake
their
thirst
but
there
is
no
trough
nor
any
pool
and
the
only
mode
to
get
the
water
is
to
catch
it
in
the
mouth
as
it
drizzles
from
the
hole
in
the
arch
it
is
difficult
for
a
horse
to
do
this
and
the
poor
things
are
beside
themselves
with
thirst
near
by
are
some
stone
ruins
in
which
a
man
and
woman
have
set
up
a
damp
and
smoking
station
from
them
i
borrow
a
shallow
dish
and
succeed
in
getting
water
for
my
horse
an
experiment
which
seems
to
surprise
all
nations
the
shop
is
an
open
stone
shed
with
a
dirt
floor
offering
only
stools
to
the
customers
yet
when
the
motley
crowd
are
seated
in
and
around
it
sipping
coffee
and
smoking
the
narghilehs
with
an
air
of
leisure
as
if
would
last
forever
you
have
a
scene
of
oriental
luxury
our
way
lies
down
a
winding
ravine
the
country
is
exceedingly
rough
like
the
wyoming
hills
but
without
trees
or
verdure
the
bed
of
the
stream
is
a
mass
of
rock
in
shelving
ledges
all
the
rock
in
sight
is
a
calcareous
limestone
after
an
hour
of
this
sort
of
secluded
travel
we
ascend
again
and
reach
the
red
khan
and
a
scene
still
more
desolate
because
more
extensive
the
khan
takes
its
name
from
the
color
of
the
rocks
perched
upon
a
high
ledge
are
the
ruins
of
this
ancient
caravansary
little
more
now
than
naked
walls
we
take
shelter
for
lunch
in
a
natural
rock
grotto
opposite
exactly
the
shadow
of
a
rock
longed
for
in
a
weary
land
here
we
spread
our
gay
rugs
the
servants
unpack
the
provision
hampers
and
we
sit
and
enjoy
the
wide
view
of
barrenness
and
the
picturesque
groups
of
pilgrims
the
spot
is
famous
for
its
excellent
well
of
water
it
is
besides
the
locality
usually
chosen
for
the
scene
of
the
adventure
of
the
man
who
went
down
to
jericho
and
fell
among
thieves
this
being
the
khan
at
which
he
was
entertained
for
twopence
we
take
our
siesta
here
reflecting
upon
the
great
advance
in
hotel
prices
and
endeavoring
to
something
of
that
past
when
this
was
the
highway
between
great
jerusalem
and
the
teeming
plain
of
the
jordan
the
woman
smoked
a
narghileh
and
looking
neither
into
the
past
nor
the
future
seemed
to
enjoy
the
present
from
this
elevation
we
see
again
the
brown
jordan
valley
and
the
dead
sea
our
road
is
downward
more
precipitously
than
it
has
been
before
the
rocks
are
tossed
about
tumultuously
and
the
hills
are
rent
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
volcanic
action
some
of
the
rock
strata
are
bent
as
you
see
the
granite
in
the
white
mountains
but
this
peculiarity
disappears
as
we
approach
nearer
to
the
jordan
the
translator
of
françois
lenormant
history
of
the
says
that
miracles
which
accompanied
the
entrance
of
the
israelites
into
palestine
seem
such
as
might
have
been
produced
by
volcanic
no
doubt
they
might
have
been
but
this
whole
region
is
absolutely
without
any
appearance
of
volcanic
disturbance
as
we
go
on
we
have
on
our
left
the
most
remarkable
ravine
in
palestine
it
is
in
fact
a
canon
in
the
rocks
some
five
hundred
feet
deep
the
sides
of
which
are
nearly
perpendicular
at
the
bottom
of
it
flows
the
brook
cherith
finding
its
way
out
into
the
jordan
plain
we
ride
to
the
brink
and
look
over
into
the
abyss
it
was
about
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
years
ago
and
probably
about
this
time
of
the
year
for
the
brook
went
dry
shortly
after
that
elijah
having
incurred
the
hostility
of
ahab
who
held
his
luxurious
court
at
samaria
by
prophesying
against
him
came
over
from
gilead
and
hid
himself
in
this
ravine
there
explains
prophet
elijah
fed
him
the
ravens
forty
days
not
have
that
kind
of
ravens
unattractive
as
this
abyss
is
for
any
but
a
temporary
summer
residence
the
example
of
elijah
recommended
it
to
a
great
number
of
people
in
a
succeeding
age
in
the
wall
of
the
precipice
are
cut
grottos
some
of
them
so
high
above
the
bed
of
the
stream
that
they
are
apparently
inaccessible
and
not
unlike
the
tombs
in
the
high
cliffs
along
the
nile
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
monks
swarmed
in
all
the
desert
places
of
egypt
and
syria
like
rabbits
these
holes
near
the
scene
of
elijah
miraculous
support
were
the
abodes
of
christian
hermits
most
of
whom
starved
themselves
down
to
mere
skin
and
bones
waiting
for
the
advent
of
the
crows
on
the
ledge
above
are
the
ruins
of
ancient
chapels
which
would
seem
to
show
that
this
was
a
place
of
some
resort
and
that
the
hermits
had
spectators
of
their
you
might
as
well
be
a
woodchuck
and
sit
in
a
hole
as
a
monk
unless
somebody
comes
and
looks
at
you
as
we
advance
the
jordan
valley
opens
more
broadly
upon
our
sight
at
this
point
which
is
the
historical
point
the
scene
of
the
passage
of
the
jordan
and
the
first
appearance
of
the
israelitish
clans
in
the
promised
land
the
valley
is
ten
miles
broad
it
is
by
no
means
a
level
plain
from
the
west
range
of
mountains
it
slopes
to
the
river
and
the
surface
is
broken
by
hillocks
ravines
and
the
breadth
is
equal
to
that
between
the
connecticut
river
at
hartford
and
the
talcott
range
of
hills
to
the
north
we
have
in
view
the
valley
almost
to
the
sea
of
galilee
and
can
see
the
white
and
round
summit
of
hermon
beyond
on
the
east
and
on
the
west
the
barren
mountains
stretch
in
level
lines
and
on
the
south
the
blue
waters
of
the
dead
sea
continue
the
valley
between
ranges
of
purple
and
poetic
rocky
cliffs
the
view
is
magnificent
in
extent
and
plain
and
hills
glow
with
color
in
this
afternoon
light
yonder
near
the
foot
of
the
eastern
hills
we
trace
the
winding
course
of
the
jordan
by
a
green
belt
of
trees
and
bushes
the
river
we
can
not
see
for
the
of
the
river
to
use
a
western
phrase
from
six
hundred
to
fifteen
hundred
feet
in
breadth
is
sunk
below
the
valley
a
hundred
feet
and
more
this
bottom
is
periodically
overflowed
the
general
aspect
of
the
plain
is
that
of
a
brown
desert
the
wild
vegetation
of
which
is
crisped
by
the
scorching
sun
there
are
however
threads
of
verdure
in
it
where
the
brook
cherith
and
the
waters
from
the
fountain
wander
through
the
neglected
plain
and
these
strips
of
green
widen
into
the
thickets
about
the
little
village
of
rîha
the
site
of
ancient
gilgal
this
valley
is
naturally
fertile
it
may
very
likely
have
been
a
paradise
of
and
grass
and
sparkling
water
when
the
jews
looked
down
upon
it
from
the
mountains
of
moab
it
certainly
bloomed
in
the
roman
occupation
and
the
ruins
of
still
existing
show
that
the
crusading
christians
made
the
cultivation
of
the
successful
here
it
needs
now
only
the
waters
of
the
jordan
and
the
streams
from
the
western
directed
by
irrigating
ditches
over
its
surface
moistening
its
ashy
and
nitrous
soil
to
become
again
a
fair
and
smiling
land
descending
down
the
stony
and
precipitous
road
we
turn
north
still
on
the
slope
of
the
valley
the
scant
grass
is
already
crisped
by
the
heat
the
bushes
are
dry
skeletons
a
ride
of
a
few
minutes
brings
us
to
some
artificial
mounds
and
ruins
of
buildings
upon
the
bank
of
the
brook
cherith
the
brickwork
is
the
fine
reticulated
masonry
such
as
you
see
in
the
remains
of
roman
villas
at
tusculum
this
is
the
site
of
herod
jericho
the
jericho
of
the
new
testament
but
the
jericho
which
joshua
destroyed
and
the
site
of
which
he
cursed
the
jericho
which
hiel
rebuilt
in
the
days
of
the
wicked
ahab
and
where
elisha
abode
after
the
translation
of
elijah
was
a
to
the
north
of
this
modern
town
we
have
some
difficulty
in
fording
the
brook
cherith
for
the
banks
are
precipitous
and
the
stream
is
deep
and
swift
those
who
are
mounted
upon
donkeys
change
them
for
horses
the
arab
attendants
wade
in
guiding
the
stumbling
animals
which
the
ladies
ride
the
lumbering
beast
with
the
soudan
babies
comes
splashing
in
at
the
wrong
moment
to
the
peril
of
those
already
in
the
torrent
and
is
nearly
swept
away
the
sheykh
and
the
servants
who
have
crossed
block
the
narrow
landing
but
with
infinite
noise
and
floundering
about
we
all
come
safely
over
and
gallop
along
a
sort
of
plateau
interspersed
with
thorny
nubk
and
scraggy
bushes
going
on
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
encountering
cultivated
spots
we
find
our
tents
already
pitched
on
the
bushy
bank
of
a
little
stream
that
issues
from
the
fountain
of
a
few
rods
above
near
the
camp
is
a
high
mound
of
rubbish
this
is
the
site
of
our
favorite
jericho
a
name
of
no
majesty
like
that
of
rome
and
endeared
to
us
by
no
associations
like
jerusalem
but
almost
as
widely
known
as
either
probably
even
its
wickedness
would
not
have
preserved
its
reputation
but
for
the
singular
incident
that
attended
its
first
destruction
jericho
must
have
been
a
city
of
some
consequence
at
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
the
israelites
we
gain
an
idea
of
the
civilization
of
its
inhabitants
from
the
nature
of
the
plunder
that
joshua
secured
there
were
vessels
of
silver
and
of
gold
and
of
brass
and
iron
and
this
was
over
fourteen
hundred
years
before
christ
before
we
descend
to
our
encampment
we
pause
for
a
survey
of
this
historic
region
there
towards
jordan
among
the
trees
is
the
site
of
gilgal
another
name
that
shares
the
reputation
of
jericho
where
the
jews
made
their
first
camp
the
king
of
jericho
like
his
royal
cousins
roundabout
had
more
spirit
in
when
he
saw
the
israelitish
host
pass
the
jordan
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
insufficient
walls
and
seems
to
have
made
no
attempt
at
a
defence
over
this
upland
the
jews
swarmed
and
all
the
armed
host
with
seven
priests
and
seven
marched
seven
days
round
and
round
the
doomed
city
and
on
the
seventh
day
the
people
shouted
the
walls
down
every
living
thing
in
the
city
was
destroyed
except
rahab
and
her
family
the
town
was
burned
and
for
five
hundred
years
thereafter
no
man
dared
to
build
upon
its
accursed
foundations
why
poor
jericho
was
specially
marked
out
for
malediction
we
are
not
told
when
it
was
rebuilt
in
ahab
time
the
sons
of
the
prophets
found
it
an
agreeable
place
of
residence
large
numbers
of
them
were
gathered
here
while
elijah
lived
and
they
conversed
with
that
prophet
when
he
was
on
his
last
journey
through
this
valley
which
he
had
so
often
traversed
compelled
by
the
spirit
of
the
lord
no
incident
in
the
biblical
story
so
strongly
appeals
to
the
imagination
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
poetical
conception
of
any
age
so
sublime
as
the
last
passage
of
elijah
across
this
plain
and
his
departure
into
heaven
beyond
jordan
when
he
came
from
bethel
to
jericho
he
begged
elisha
his
attendant
to
tarry
here
but
the
latter
would
not
yield
either
to
his
entreaty
or
to
that
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
we
can
see
the
way
the
two
prophets
went
hence
to
jordan
fifty
men
of
the
sons
of
the
prophets
went
and
stood
to
view
them
afar
off
and
they
saw
the
two
stand
by
jordan
already
it
was
known
that
elijah
was
to
disappear
and
the
two
figures
lessening
in
the
distance
were
followed
with
a
fearful
curiosity
did
they
pass
on
swiftly
and
was
there
some
premonition
in
the
wind
that
blew
their
flowing
mantles
of
the
heavenly
gale
elijah
smites
the
waters
with
his
mantle
the
two
pass
over
and
they
still
went
on
and
talked
behold
there
appeared
a
chariot
of
fire
and
horses
of
fire
and
parted
them
both
asunder
and
elijah
went
up
by
a
whirlwind
into
heaven
and
elisha
saw
it
and
he
cried
father
my
father
the
chariot
of
israel
and
the
horsemen
thereof
and
he
saw
him
no
elislia
returned
to
jericho
and
abode
there
while
the
sons
of
the
prophets
sought
for
elijah
beyond
jordan
three
days
but
did
not
find
him
and
the
men
of
the
city
said
to
elisha
i
pray
thee
the
situation
of
this
city
is
pleasant
as
my
lord
seeth
but
the
water
is
naught
and
the
ground
is
then
elisha
took
salt
and
healed
the
spring
of
water
and
ever
since
to
this
day
the
fountain
now
called
has
sent
forth
sweet
water
turning
towards
the
northwest
we
see
the
passage
through
the
mountain
by
the
fountain
duk
to
bethel
it
was
out
of
some
woods
there
where
the
mountain
is
now
bare
that
elisha
called
the
two
which
administered
that
dreadful
lesson
to
the
children
who
derided
his
baldness
all
the
region
indeed
recalls
the
miracles
of
elisha
it
was
probably
here
that
naaman
the
syrian
came
to
be
healed
there
at
gilgal
elisha
took
the
death
out
of
the
great
pot
in
which
the
sons
of
the
prophets
were
seething
their
pottage
and
it
was
there
in
the
jordan
that
he
made
the
iron
axe
to
swim
of
all
this
celebrated
and
jericho
nothing
now
remains
but
a
hillock
and
elisha
spring
the
wild
beasts
of
the
desert
prowl
about
it
and
the
hoots
over
its
fall
sort
of
echo
of
the
shouts
that
brought
down
its
walls
our
tents
are
pitched
near
the
hillock
and
the
animals
are
picketed
on
the
open
ground
before
them
by
the
stream
the
syrian
tourist
in
these
days
travels
luxuriously
our
own
party
has
four
tents
kitchen
tent
the
dining
tent
and
two
for
lodging
they
are
furnished
with
tables
chairs
all
the
conveniences
of
the
toilet
and
carpeted
with
bright
rugs
the
cook
is
an
artist
and
our
table
is
one
that
would
have
astonished
the
sons
of
the
prophets
the
syrian
party
have
their
own
tents
a
family
from
kentucky
has
camped
near
by
and
we
give
to
jericho
a
settled
appearance
the
elder
sheykh
accompanies
the
other
party
of
americans
so
that
we
have
now
all
the
protection
possible
the
dragoman
of
the
kentuckians
we
have
already
encountered
in
egypt
and
on
the
journey
and
been
impressed
by
his
respectable
gravity
it
would
perhaps
be
difficult
for
him
to
tell
his
nationality
or
birthplace
he
wears
the
european
dress
and
his
gold
spectacles
and
big
stomach
would
pass
him
anywhere
for
a
german
professor
he
seems
out
of
place
as
a
dragoman
but
if
any
one
desired
a
savant
as
a
companion
in
the
east
he
would
be
the
man
indeed
his
employers
soon
discover
that
his
forte
is
information
and
not
work
while
the
other
servants
are
busy
about
the
camps
antonio
comes
over
to
our
tent
and
opens
up
the
richness
of
his
mind
and
illustrates
his
capacity
as
a
syrian
guide
know
that
mountain
there
with
the
chapel
on
top
he
asks
that
is
mt
nebo
and
that
one
next
to
it
is
pisgah
the
mountain
of
the
prophet
both
these
mountains
are
of
course
on
the
other
side
of
the
jordan
in
the
moab
range
but
they
are
not
identified
by
antonio
the
sharp
mountain
behind
us
is
quarantania
the
mount
of
temptation
its
whole
side
to
the
summit
is
with
the
cells
of
hermits
who
once
dwelt
there
and
it
is
still
the
resort
of
many
pilgrims
the
evening
is
charming
warm
but
not
depressing
the
atmosphere
is
even
exhilarating
and
this
surprises
us
since
we
are
so
far
below
the
sea
level
the
doctor
says
that
it
is
exactly
like
colorado
on
a
july
night
we
have
never
been
so
low
before
not
even
in
a
we
are
not
only
about
hundred
feet
below
jerusalem
we
are
over
twelve
hundred
below
the
level
of
the
sea
sitting
outside
the
tent
under
the
starlight
we
enjoy
the
novelty
and
the
mysteriousness
of
the
scene
tents
horses
picketed
among
the
bushes
the
firelight
the
groups
of
servants
and
drivers
taking
their
supper
the
figure
of
an
arab
from
gilgal
coming
forward
occasionally
out
of
the
darkness
the
singing
the
occasional
violent
outbreak
of
kicking
and
squealing
among
the
horses
and
mules
the
running
of
attendants
to
the
rescue
of
some
poor
beast
the
strong
impression
of
the
locality
upon
us
and
i
know
not
what
old
testament
flavor
about
it
all
conspire
to
make
the
night
memorable
place
very
dangerous
says
antonio
who
is
standing
round
bursting
with
information
berry
wise
is
opinion
of
him
a
great
deal
i
tink
him
not
live
is
the
danger
we
ask
beasts
wild
boars
hyenas
these
bush
full
of
them
it
was
three
years
now
i
was
camped
here
with
baron
kronkheit
twelve
i
heard
a
noise
and
came
out
right
there
not
twenty
feet
from
here
stood
a
hyena
as
big
as
a
donkey
his
two
eyes
like
fire
i
did
not
shoot
him
for
fear
to
wake
up
the
he
kill
any
of
your
party
any
man
in
the
morning
i
find
he
has
carried
off
our
only
notwithstanding
these
dangers
the
night
passes
without
alarm
except
the
barking
of
jackals
about
the
kitchen
tent
in
the
morning
i
ask
antonio
if
he
heard
the
hyenas
howling
in
the
night
indeed
plenty
of
them
they
came
very
near
my
we
are
astir
at
sunrise
breakfast
and
start
for
the
jordan
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
dragoman
and
the
sheykh
that
we
should
go
first
to
the
dead
sea
it
is
the
custom
every
tourist
goes
to
the
dead
sea
first
bathes
and
then
washes
off
the
salt
in
the
jordan
no
one
ever
thought
of
going
to
the
jordan
first
it
is
impossible
we
must
visit
the
dead
sea
and
then
lunch
at
the
jordan
we
wished
on
the
contrary
to
lunch
at
the
dead
sea
at
which
we
should
otherwise
only
have
a
very
brief
time
we
insisted
upon
our
own
programme
to
the
great
disgust
of
all
our
camp
attendants
who
predicted
disaster
the
jordan
is
an
hour
and
a
half
from
jericho
that
is
the
distance
to
the
of
the
greek
pilgrims
we
descend
all
the
way
wild
vegetation
is
never
wanting
abound
we
pass
through
thickets
of
thorns
bearing
the
yellow
of
the
dead
sea
which
grow
all
over
this
plain
at
gilgal
now
called
biha
we
find
what
is
probably
the
nastiest
village
in
the
world
and
its
miserable
inhabitants
are
credited
with
all
the
vices
of
sodom
the
wretched
huts
are
surrounded
by
a
thicket
of
nubk
as
a
protection
against
the
plundering
bedaween
the
houses
are
rudely
built
of
stone
with
a
covering
of
cane
or
brush
and
each
one
is
enclosed
in
a
hedge
of
thorns
these
thorns
which
grow
rankly
on
the
plain
are
those
of
which
the
of
was
plaited
and
all
devout
pilgrims
carry
away
some
of
them
the
habitations
within
these
thorny
enclosures
are
filthy
beyond
description
and
and
this
is
in
a
watered
plain
which
would
bloom
with
all
manner
of
fruits
with
the
least
care
indeed
there
are
a
few
tangled
gardens
of
the
rankest
vegetation
in
them
we
see
the
orange
the
fig
the
deceptive
pomegranate
with
its
pink
blossoms
and
the
olive
as
this
is
the
time
of
pilgrimage
a
company
of
turkish
soldiers
from
jerusalem
is
encamped
at
the
village
and
the
broken
country
about
it
is
covered
with
tents
booths
shops
kitchens
and
presents
the
appearance
of
a
fair
and
a
combined
there
are
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
pilgrims
who
go
every
morning
as
long
as
they
remain
here
to
dip
in
the
jordan
near
the
village
rises
the
square
tower
of
an
old
convent
probably
which
is
dignified
with
the
name
of
the
of
this
plain
was
once
famed
for
its
fertility
it
was
covered
with
gardens
and
the
precious
balsam
honey
and
henna
were
produced
here
the
balsam
gardens
were
the
royal
gift
of
antony
to
cleopatra
who
transferred
the
to
heliopolis
in
egypt
as
we
ride
away
from
gilgal
and
come
upon
a
more
open
and
desert
plain
i
encounter
an
eagle
sitting
on
the
top
of
a
not
the
noblest
of
his
species
but
for
palestine
a
very
fair
eagle
here
is
a
chance
for
the
syrian
hunter
he
is
armed
with
gun
and
pistols
he
has
his
dogs
now
if
ever
is
the
time
for
him
to
hunt
and
i
fall
back
and
point
out
his
opportunity
he
does
not
embrace
it
it
is
an
easy
shot
perhaps
he
is
looking
for
wild
boars
perhaps
he
is
a
hunter
at
any
rate
he
makes
no
effort
to
take
the
eagle
and
when
i
ride
forward
the
bird
gracefully
rises
in
the
air
sweeping
upward
in
magnificent
circles
now
veering
towards
the
mount
of
temptation
and
now
towards
nebo
but
always
as
serene
as
the
air
in
which
he
floats
and
now
occurs
one
of
those
incidents
which
are
not
rare
to
travellers
in
syria
but
which
are
rare
and
scarcely
believed
elsewhere
as
the
eagle
hangs
for
a
second
motionless
in
the
empyrean
far
before
me
he
drops
a
feather
i
see
the
gray
plume
glance
in
the
sun
and
swirl
slowly
down
in
the
lucid
air
in
judæa
every
object
is
as
distinct
as
in
a
photograph
you
can
see
things
at
a
distance
you
can
make
no
one
believe
at
home
the
eagle
plume
detached
from
the
noble
bird
begins
its
leisurely
descent
i
see
in
a
moment
my
opportunity
i
might
never
have
another
all
travellers
in
syria
whose
books
i
have
ever
read
have
one
or
more
startling
adventures
usually
it
is
with
a
horse
i
do
not
remember
any
with
a
horse
and
an
eagle
i
determine
at
once
to
have
one
glancing
a
moment
at
the
company
behind
me
and
then
fixing
my
eye
on
the
falling
feather
i
speak
a
word
to
my
steed
and
dart
forward
a
word
was
enough
the
noble
animal
seemed
to
comprehend
the
situation
he
was
of
the
purest
arab
breed
four
legs
four
white
ankles
small
ears
slender
pasterns
nostrils
thin
as
tissue
paper
and
dilating
upon
the
fall
of
a
leaf
an
eye
terrible
in
rage
but
melting
in
affection
a
round
barrel
gentle
as
a
kitten
but
spirited
as
a
his
mother
was
a
nedjed
mare
from
medina
who
had
been
exchanged
by
a
bedawee
chief
for
nine
beautiful
circassians
but
only
as
a
compromise
after
a
war
by
the
pasha
of
egypt
for
her
possession
her
father
was
one
of
the
most
respectable
horses
in
yemen
neither
father
mother
nor
colt
had
ever
eaten
anything
but
selected
dates
at
the
word
abdallah
springs
forward
bounding
over
the
sand
skimming
over
the
thorn
bushes
scattering
the
jordan
pilgrims
right
and
left
he
does
not
seem
to
be
so
much
a
horse
as
a
creation
of
the
imagination
pegasus
at
every
leap
we
gain
upon
the
feather
but
it
is
still
far
ahead
of
us
and
swirling
down
down
as
the
air
takes
the
plume
or
the
weight
of
gravity
acts
upon
the
quill
abdallah
does
not
yet
know
the
object
of
our
fearful
pace
but
his
docility
is
such
that
every
time
i
speak
to
him
he
seems
to
shoot
out
of
himself
in
sudden
bursts
of
enthusiasm
the
terrible
strain
continues
longer
than
i
had
supposed
it
would
for
i
had
undercalculated
both
the
height
at
which
the
feather
was
cast
and
my
distance
to
the
spot
upon
which
it
must
fall
none
but
a
horse
fed
on
dates
could
keep
up
the
awful
gait
we
fly
and
the
feather
falls
and
it
falls
with
increasing
momentum
it
is
going
going
to
the
ground
and
we
are
not
there
at
this
instant
when
i
am
in
despair
the
feather
twirls
and
abdallah
suddenly
casts
his
eye
up
and
catches
the
glint
of
it
the
glance
suffices
to
put
him
completely
in
possession
of
the
situation
he
gives
a
low
neigh
of
joy
i
plunge
both
spurs
into
his
flanks
about
six
or
seven
inches
he
leaps
into
the
air
and
sails
like
a
bird
course
only
for
a
moment
but
it
is
enough
i
stretch
out
my
hand
and
catch
the
eagle
plume
before
it
touches
the
ground
we
light
on
the
other
side
of
a
clump
of
thorns
and
abdallah
walks
on
as
quietly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
he
was
not
blown
not
a
hair
of
his
glossy
coat
was
turned
i
have
the
feather
to
show
pilgrims
are
plenty
returning
from
the
river
in
a
continuous
procession
in
numbers
rivalling
the
children
of
israel
when
they
first
camped
at
gilgal
we
descend
into
the
wind
through
the
clumps
of
tangled
bushes
and
at
length
reach
an
open
place
where
the
river
for
a
few
rods
is
visible
the
ground
is
trampled
like
a
for
cattle
the
bushes
are
not
large
enough
to
give
shade
there
are
no
trees
of
size
except
one
or
two
at
the
water
edge
the
banks
are
slimy
there
seems
to
be
no
comfortable
place
to
sit
except
on
your
jordan
stormy
banks
i
stand
and
cast
a
wistful
eye
the
wistful
eye
encounters
nothing
agreeable
the
jordan
here
resembles
the
arkansas
above
little
rock
says
the
doctor
i
think
it
is
about
the
size
of
the
concord
where
it
flows
through
the
classic
town
of
that
name
in
massachusetts
but
it
is
much
swifter
indeed
it
is
a
rapid
current
which
would
sweep
away
the
strongest
swimmer
the
opposite
bank
is
steep
and
composed
of
sandy
loam
or
marl
the
hither
bank
is
low
but
slippery
and
it
is
difficult
to
dip
up
water
from
it
close
to
the
shore
the
water
is
shallow
and
a
rope
is
stretched
out
for
the
protection
of
the
bathers
this
is
the
greek
but
we
are
too
late
to
see
the
pilgrims
enter
the
stream
crowds
of
them
are
still
here
cutting
canes
to
carry
away
and
filling
their
tin
cans
with
the
holy
water
we
taste
the
water
which
is
very
muddy
and
find
it
warm
but
not
unpleasant
we
are
glad
that
we
have
decided
to
lunch
at
the
dead
sea
for
a
more
uninviting
place
than
this
could
not
he
found
above
and
below
this
spot
are
thickets
and
boggy
ground
it
is
beneath
the
historical
and
religious
dignity
of
the
occasion
to
speak
of
lunch
but
all
tourists
know
what
importance
it
assumes
on
such
an
excursion
and
that
their
high
reflections
seldom
come
to
them
on
the
historical
spot
indeed
one
must
be
removed
some
distance
from
the
vulgar
jordan
before
he
can
glow
at
the
thought
of
it
in
swiftness
and
volume
it
exceeds
our
expectations
but
its
beauty
is
entirely
a
creation
of
the
imagination
we
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
only
a
solitary
pilgrim
bathe
this
was
a
greek
young
man
who
reluctantly
ventured
into
the
dirty
water
up
to
his
knees
and
stood
there
shivering
and
whimpering
over
the
orders
of
the
priest
on
the
bank
who
insisted
upon
his
dipping
perhaps
the
boy
lacked
faith
perhaps
it
was
his
first
experiment
with
water
at
any
rate
he
stood
there
until
his
spiritual
father
waded
in
and
ducked
the
blubbering
and
sputtering
neophyte
under
this
was
not
a
baptism
but
a
meritorious
bath
some
seedy
fellahs
from
gilgal
sat
on
the
bank
fishing
when
i
asked
them
if
they
had
anything
they
produced
from
the
corners
of
their
gowns
some
roman
copper
coins
picked
up
at
jericho
and
which
they
swore
were
dropped
there
by
the
jews
when
they
assaulted
the
city
with
the
these
idle
fishermen
caught
now
and
then
a
rather
soft
perch
with
large
scales
fish
which
the
greeks
however
pronounced
we
leave
the
river
and
ride
for
an
hour
and
a
half
across
a
nearly
level
plain
the
earth
of
which
shows
salts
here
and
there
dotted
with
a
low
plant
something
like
the
american
enliven
the
way
and
although
the
country
is
not
exactly
cheerful
it
has
no
appearance
of
desolation
except
such
as
comes
from
lack
of
water
the
dead
sea
is
the
least
dead
of
any
sheet
of
water
i
know
when
we
first
arrived
the
waters
were
a
lovely
blue
which
changed
to
green
in
the
shifting
light
but
they
were
always
animated
and
sparkling
it
has
a
sloping
sandy
beach
strewn
with
pebbles
up
which
the
waves
come
with
a
pleasant
murmur
the
plain
is
hot
here
we
find
à
cool
breeze
the
lovely
plain
of
water
stretches
away
to
the
south
between
blue
and
purple
ranges
of
mountains
which
thrust
occasionally
bold
promontories
into
it
and
add
a
charm
to
the
perspective
the
sea
is
not
inimical
either
to
vegetable
or
animal
life
on
its
borders
before
we
reach
it
i
hear
high
in
the
air
like
the
song
of
a
lark
birds
are
flitting
about
the
shore
and
singing
and
gulls
are
wheeling
over
the
water
a
rabbit
runs
into
his
hole
close
by
the
beach
growing
close
to
the
shore
is
a
high
woody
stonewort
with
abundance
of
fleshy
leaves
and
thousands
of
blossoms
delicate
protruding
stamens
hanging
over
the
waters
of
the
sea
itself
the
plant
with
the
small
yellow
fruit
which
we
take
to
be
that
of
the
apples
of
sodom
also
grows
here
it
is
the
solarium
spinosa
closely
allied
to
the
potato
and
tomato
it
has
a
woody
stem
with
sharp
recurved
thorns
sometimes
grows
ten
feet
high
and
is
now
covered
with
round
orange
berries
it
is
not
the
scene
of
desolation
that
we
expected
although
some
branches
and
trunks
of
trees
gnarled
and
bleached
the
of
the
jordan
strewn
along
the
beach
impart
a
dead
aspect
to
the
shore
these
dry
branches
are
however
useful
we
build
them
up
into
a
wigwam
over
which
we
spread
our
blankets
under
this
we
sit
sheltered
from
the
sun
enjoying
the
delightful
breeze
and
the
cheering
prospect
of
the
sparkling
sea
the
improvident
arabs
now
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
fresh
water
begin
to
want
it
they
have
exhausted
their
own
jugs
and
ours
having
neglected
to
bring
anything
like
an
adequate
supply
to
see
water
and
not
be
able
to
drink
it
is
too
much
for
their
philosophy
the
party
separates
along
the
shore
seeking
for
places
where
bushes
grow
out
upon
tongues
of
land
and
offer
shelter
from
observation
for
the
bather
the
first
impression
we
have
of
the
water
is
its
perfect
clearness
it
is
the
most
innocent
water
in
appearance
and
you
would
not
suspect
its
saltness
and
extreme
bitterness
no
fish
live
in
it
the
water
is
too
salt
for
anything
but
codfish
its
buoyancy
has
not
been
exaggerated
by
travellers
but
i
did
not
expect
to
find
bathing
in
it
so
agreeable
as
it
is
the
water
is
of
a
happy
temperature
soft
not
exactly
oily
but
exceedingly
agreeable
to
the
skin
and
it
left
a
delicious
sensation
after
the
bath
but
it
is
necessary
to
be
careful
not
to
get
any
of
it
into
the
eyes
for
myself
i
found
swimming
in
it
delightful
and
i
wish
the
atlantic
ocean
were
like
it
nobody
then
would
ever
be
drowned
floating
is
no
effort
on
the
contrary
sinking
is
impossible
the
only
annoyance
in
swimming
is
the
tendency
of
the
feet
to
strike
out
of
water
and
of
the
swimmer
to
go
over
on
his
head
when
i
stood
upright
in
the
water
it
came
about
to
my
shoulders
but
it
was
difficult
to
stand
from
the
constant
desire
of
the
feet
to
go
to
the
surface
i
suppose
that
the
different
accounts
of
travellers
in
regard
to
the
buoyancy
of
the
water
are
due
to
the
different
specific
gravity
of
the
writers
we
can
not
all
be
doctors
of
divinity
i
found
that
the
best
way
to
float
was
to
make
a
bow
of
the
body
and
rest
with
feet
and
head
out
of
water
which
was
something
like
being
in
a
cushioned
chair
even
then
it
requires
some
care
not
to
turn
over
the
bather
seems
to
himself
to
be
a
cork
and
has
little
control
of
his
body
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
shore
is
an
artificial
island
of
stone
upon
which
are
remains
of
regular
masonry
probably
some
crusader
had
a
castle
there
we
notice
upon
looking
down
into
the
clear
depths
some
distance
out
in
the
sunlight
that
the
lake
seems
as
it
flows
to
have
translucent
streaks
which
are
like
a
thick
solution
of
sugar
showing
how
completely
saturated
it
is
with
salts
it
is
in
fact
twelve
hundred
and
feet
below
the
mediterranean
nothing
but
a
deep
sea
the
chloride
of
magnesia
which
gives
it
its
extraordinarily
bitter
taste
does
not
crystallize
and
precipitate
itself
so
readily
as
the
chloride
of
sodium
we
look
in
vain
for
any
evidence
of
volcanic
disturbance
or
action
of
fire
whatever
there
may
be
at
the
other
end
of
the
lake
there
is
none
here
we
find
no
bitumen
or
any
although
the
black
stones
along
the
beach
may
have
been
supposed
to
be
bituminous
all
the
pebbles
and
all
the
stones
of
the
beach
are
of
chalk
flint
and
tell
no
story
of
fire
or
volcanic
fury
indeed
the
lake
has
no
apparent
hostility
to
life
an
enterprising
company
could
draw
off
the
jordan
thirty
miles
above
here
and
make
all
this
valley
a
garden
producing
fruits
and
and
cotton
and
this
lake
one
of
the
most
lovely
in
the
world
i
have
no
doubt
maladies
could
be
discovered
which
its
waters
are
exactly
calculated
to
cure
i
confidently
expect
to
hear
some
day
that
great
hotels
are
built
upon
this
shore
which
are
crowded
with
the
pious
the
fashionable
and
the
diseased
i
seem
to
see
this
blue
and
sunny
lake
covered
with
a
gay
multitude
of
bathers
floating
about
the
livelong
day
on
its
surface
parties
of
them
making
a
pleasure
excursion
to
the
foot
of
pisgah
groups
of
them
chatting
singing
amusing
themselves
as
they
would
under
the
shade
of
trees
on
land
having
umbrellas
and
floating
awnings
and
perhaps
servants
to
bear
their
parasols
couples
floating
here
and
there
at
will
in
the
sweet
dream
of
a
love
that
seems
to
be
suspended
between
the
heaven
and
the
earth
no
one
will
be
at
any
expense
for
boats
for
every
one
will
be
his
own
boat
and
launch
himself
without
sail
or
oars
whenever
he
pleases
how
dainty
will
be
the
little
feminine
barks
that
the
tossing
mariner
will
hail
on
that
peaceful
sea
no
more
wailing
of
wives
over
husbands
drowned
in
the
waves
no
more
rescuing
of
limp
girls
by
courageous
lovers
people
may
be
shipwrecked
if
there
comes
a
squall
from
moab
but
they
can
not
be
drowned
i
confess
that
this
picture
is
the
most
fascinating
that
i
have
been
able
to
conjure
up
in
syria
we
take
our
lunch
under
the
wigwam
fanned
by
a
pleasant
breeze
the
persons
who
partake
it
present
a
pleasing
variety
of
nations
and
colors
and
the
itself
though
simple
was
gathered
from
many
lands
some
one
took
the
trouble
to
note
the
variety
raisins
from
damascus
bread
chicken
and
mutton
from
jerusalem
white
wine
from
bethlehem
figs
from
smyrna
cheese
from
america
dates
from
nubia
walnuts
from
germany
water
from
elisha
well
eggs
from
hen
we
should
like
to
linger
till
night
in
this
enchanting
place
but
for
an
hour
the
sheykh
and
dragoman
have
been
urging
our
departure
men
and
beasts
are
represented
as
suffering
for
water
because
we
have
reversed
the
usual
order
of
travel
as
soon
as
we
leave
the
lake
we
lose
its
breeze
the
heat
becomes
severe
the
sandy
plain
is
rolling
and
a
little
broken
but
it
has
no
shade
no
water
and
is
indeed
a
weary
way
the
horses
feel
the
want
of
water
sadly
the
arabs
whom
we
had
supposed
patient
in
deprivation
are
almost
crazy
with
thirst
after
we
have
ridden
for
over
an
hour
the
sheykh
horse
suddenly
wheels
off
and
runs
over
the
plain
my
nag
follows
him
apparently
without
reason
and
in
spite
of
my
efforts
i
am
run
away
with
the
horses
dash
along
and
soon
the
whole
cavalcade
is
racing
after
us
the
object
is
soon
visible
fringe
of
trees
which
denotes
a
brook
the
horses
press
on
dash
down
the
steep
bank
and
plunge
their
heads
into
the
water
up
to
the
eyes
the
arabs
follow
suit
the
sheykh
declares
that
in
fifteen
minutes
more
both
men
and
horses
would
have
been
dead
never
before
did
anybody
lunch
at
the
dead
sea
when
the
train
comes
up
the
patient
donkey
that
madame
rides
is
pushed
through
the
brook
and
not
permitted
to
wet
his
muzzle
i
am
indignant
at
such
cruelty
and
spring
off
my
horse
push
the
two
aside
and
lead
the
eager
donkey
to
the
stream
at
once
there
is
a
cry
of
protest
from
dragomans
sheykh
and
the
whole
crowd
drink
donkey
no
drink
donkey
no
let
donkey
bad
for
there
could
not
have
been
a
greater
outcry
among
the
jews
when
the
ark
of
the
covenant
was
likely
to
touch
the
water
i
desist
from
my
charitable
efforts
why
the
poor
beast
whose
whole
body
craved
water
as
much
as
that
of
the
horse
was
denied
it
i
know
not
it
is
said
that
if
you
give
a
donkey
water
on
the
road
he
wo
go
thereafter
certainly
the
donkey
is
never
permitted
to
drink
when
travelling
i
think
the
patient
and
chastened
creature
will
get
more
in
the
next
world
than
his
cruel
masters
nearly
all
the
way
over
the
plain
we
have
the
long
snowy
range
of
mt
herinon
in
sight
a
noble
object
closing
the
long
northern
vista
and
a
refreshment
to
the
eyes
wearied
by
the
parched
vegetation
of
the
valley
and
dazzled
by
the
aerial
shimmer
if
we
turn
from
the
north
to
the
south
we
have
the
entirely
different
but
equally
poetical
prospect
of
the
blue
sea
enclosed
in
the
receding
hills
which
fall
away
into
the
violet
shade
of
the
horizon
the
jordan
valley
is
unique
by
a
geologic
fault
it
is
dropped
over
a
thousand
feet
below
the
it
is
guarded
by
which
are
from
a
thousand
to
two
thousand
feet
high
at
one
end
is
a
mountain
ten
thousand
feet
high
from
which
the
snow
never
disappears
at
the
other
end
is
a
lake
forty
miles
long
of
the
saltest
and
bitterest
water
in
the
world
all
these
contrasts
the
eye
embraces
at
one
point
we
dismount
at
the
camp
of
the
russian
pilgrims
by
rîha
and
walk
among
the
tents
and
booths
the
sharpers
of
syria
attend
the
strangers
tempt
them
with
various
holy
wares
and
entice
them
into
their
dirty
it
is
a
scene
of
mingled
credulity
and
knavery
of
devotion
and
traffic
there
are
great
booths
for
the
sale
of
vegetables
nuts
and
dried
fruit
the
whole
may
be
sufficiently
described
as
a
without
any
at
sunset
i
have
a
quiet
hour
by
the
fountain
of
elisha
it
is
a
remarkable
pool
under
the
ledge
of
limestone
rocks
the
water
gushes
out
with
considerable
force
and
in
such
volume
as
to
form
a
large
brook
which
flows
out
of
the
basin
and
murmurs
over
a
stony
bed
you
can
not
recover
your
surprise
to
see
a
river
in
this
dry
country
burst
suddenly
out
of
the
ground
a
group
of
native
women
have
come
to
the
pool
with
jars
and
they
stay
to
gossip
sitting
about
the
edge
upon
the
stones
with
their
feet
in
the
water
one
of
them
wears
a
red
gown
and
her
cheeks
are
as
red
as
her
dress
indeed
i
have
met
several
women
who
had
the
complexion
of
a
ripe
flemish
beauty
pear
as
it
seems
to
be
the
fashion
i
also
sit
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
with
my
feet
in
the
warm
swift
water
and
enjoy
the
sunset
and
the
strange
concourse
of
pilgrims
who
are
gathering
about
the
well
they
are
worthy
greeks
very
decent
people
men
and
women
who
salute
me
pleasantly
as
they
arrive
and
seem
to
take
my
participation
in
the
bath
as
an
act
of
friendship
just
below
the
large
pool
by
a
smaller
one
a
greek
boy
having
bathed
is
about
to
dress
and
i
am
interested
to
watch
the
process
the
first
article
to
go
on
is
a
white
shirt
over
this
he
puts
on
two
blue
woollen
shirts
he
then
draws
on
a
pair
of
large
loose
trousers
into
these
the
shirts
are
tucked
and
the
trousers
are
tied
at
the
waist
is
bothered
with
neither
pins
nor
buttons
then
comes
the
turban
which
is
a
soft
gray
and
yellow
material
a
red
belt
is
next
wound
twice
about
the
waist
the
vest
is
yellow
and
open
in
front
and
the
costume
is
completed
by
a
jaunty
jacket
of
yellow
prettily
embroidered
the
heap
of
clothes
on
the
bank
did
not
promise
much
but
the
result
is
a
very
handsome
boy
dressed
i
am
sure
most
comfortably
for
this
climate
while
i
sit
here
the
son
of
the
sheykh
rides
his
horse
to
the
pool
he
is
not
more
than
ten
years
old
is
very
smartly
dressed
in
gay
colors
and
exceedingly
handsome
although
he
has
somewhat
the
supercilious
manner
of
a
lad
born
in
the
purple
the
little
prince
speaks
french
and
ostentatiously
displays
in
his
belt
a
big
revolver
i
am
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
seeing
one
of
the
desert
robbers
in
embryo
when
it
is
dusk
we
have
an
invasion
from
the
neighboring
bedaween
an
imposition
to
which
all
tourists
are
subjected
it
being
taken
for
granted
that
we
desire
to
see
a
native
dance
this
is
one
of
the
ways
these
honest
people
have
of
levying
tribute
by
the
connivance
of
our
protectors
the
head
sheykhs
the
entertainment
is
forced
upon
us
and
the
performers
will
not
depart
without
a
liberal
backsheesh
we
are
already
somewhat
familiar
with
the
fascinating
dances
of
the
orient
and
have
only
a
languid
curiosity
about
those
of
the
jordan
but
before
we
are
aware
there
is
a
crowd
before
our
tents
and
the
evening
is
disturbed
by
doleful
howling
and
the
scene
in
the
flickering
firelight
is
sufficiently
fantastic
the
men
dance
first
some
twenty
or
thirty
of
them
form
in
a
standing
close
together
their
gowns
are
in
rags
their
black
hair
is
tossed
in
tangled
disorder
and
their
eyes
shine
with
animal
wildness
the
only
dancing
they
perform
consists
in
a
violent
swaying
of
the
body
from
side
to
side
in
concert
faster
and
faster
as
the
excitement
rises
with
an
occasional
stamping
of
the
feet
and
a
continual
howling
like
darwishes
two
vagabonds
step
into
the
focus
of
the
and
hop
about
in
the
most
manner
swinging
enormous
swords
over
their
heads
and
giving
from
time
to
time
a
seems
to
be
precisely
the
dance
of
the
north
american
indians
we
are
told
however
that
the
howling
is
a
song
and
that
the
song
relates
to
meeting
the
enemy
and
demolishing
him
the
longer
the
performance
goes
on
the
less
we
like
it
for
the
uncouthness
is
not
varied
by
a
single
graceful
motion
and
the
monotony
becomes
unendurable
we
long
for
the
women
to
begin
when
the
women
begin
we
wish
we
had
the
men
back
again
creatures
uglier
and
dirtier
than
these
hags
could
not
be
found
their
dance
is
much
the
same
as
that
of
the
men
a
semicircle
with
a
couple
of
women
to
jump
about
and
whirl
swords
but
the
women
display
more
fierceness
and
more
passion
as
they
warm
to
their
work
and
their
shrill
cries
dishevelled
hair
loose
robes
and
frantic
gestures
give
us
new
ideas
of
the
capacity
of
the
gentle
sex
you
think
that
they
would
not
only
slay
their
enemies
but
drink
their
blood
and
dance
upon
their
fragments
indeed
one
of
their
songs
is
altogether
belligerent
it
taunts
the
men
with
cowardice
it
scoffs
them
for
not
daring
to
fight
it
declares
that
the
women
like
the
sword
and
know
how
to
use
it
thus
and
thus
and
thus
lunging
their
swords
into
the
air
would
they
pierce
the
imaginary
enemy
but
these
sweet
creatures
do
not
sing
altogether
of
war
they
sing
of
love
in
the
same
strident
voices
and
fierce
manner
lover
will
meet
me
by
the
stream
he
will
take
me
over
the
when
the
performance
is
over
they
all
clamor
for
backsheesh
it
is
given
in
a
lump
to
their
sheykh
and
they
retire
into
the
bushes
and
wrangle
over
its
distribution
the
women
return
to
us
and
say
you
give
our
backsheesh
to
sheykh
we
no
get
any
men
get
it
seems
that
women
are
animated
nowadays
by
the
same
spirit
the
world
over
and
make
the
same
just
complaints
of
the
injustice
of
men
when
we
turn
in
there
is
a
light
gleaming
from
a
cell
high
up
on
mt
temptation
where
some
modern
pilgrim
is
playing
hermit
for
the
night
we
are
up
early
in
the
morning
and
prepare
for
the
journey
to
jerusalem
near
our
camp
some
abyssinian
pilgrims
christians
so
called
have
encamped
in
the
bushes
a
priest
and
three
or
four
laymen
the
cleverest
and
most
decent
abyssinians
we
have
met
with
they
are
from
gondar
and
have
been
a
year
and
a
half
on
their
pilgrimage
from
their
country
to
the
jordan
the
priest
is
severely
ill
with
a
fever
and
his
condition
excites
the
compassion
of
who
procures
for
him
a
donkey
to
ride
back
to
the
city
about
the
only
luggage
of
the
party
consists
of
sacred
books
written
on
parchment
and
preserved
with
great
care
among
them
the
gospel
of
john
the
psalms
the
pentateuch
and
volumes
of
prayers
to
the
virgin
they
are
willing
to
exchange
some
of
these
manuscripts
for
silver
and
we
make
up
besides
a
little
purse
for
the
sick
man
these
abyssinian
christians
when
at
home
live
under
the
old
dispensation
rather
than
the
new
holding
rather
to
the
law
of
moses
than
of
christ
and
practise
generally
all
the
vices
of
all
ages
the
colony
of
them
at
jerusalem
is
a
disreputable
lot
of
lewd
beggars
so
that
we
are
glad
to
find
some
of
the
race
who
have
gentle
manners
and
are
outwardly
respectable
to
be
sure
we
had
come
a
greater
distance
than
they
to
the
jordan
but
they
had
been
much
longer
on
the
way
the
day
is
very
hot
the
intense
sun
beats
upon
the
white
limestone
rocks
and
is
reflected
into
the
valleys
our
view
in
returning
is
better
than
it
was
in
coming
the
plain
and
the
foot
of
the
pass
are
covered
with
a
bloom
of
flowers
we
meet
and
pass
more
pilgrims
than
before
we
overtake
them
resting
or
asleep
by
the
roadside
in
the
shade
of
the
rocks
they
all
carry
bundles
of
sticks
and
canes
cut
on
the
banks
of
the
jordan
and
most
of
them
jordan
water
in
cans
bottles
and
pitchers
there
are
motley
loads
of
baggage
kitchen
utensils
beds
children
we
see
again
two
three
and
four
on
one
horse
or
mule
and
now
and
then
a
row
as
if
on
a
bench
across
the
horse
back
taking
up
the
whole
road
we
overtake
one
old
woman
a
russian
who
can
not
be
less
than
seventy
with
a
round
body
and
legs
as
short
as
ducks
and
as
big
as
the
of
a
piano
her
big
feet
are
encased
in
straw
shoes
the
shape
of
a
long
she
wears
a
short
calico
gown
an
old
cotton
handkerchief
enwraps
her
gray
head
she
carries
on
her
back
a
big
bundle
of
clothing
an
extra
pair
of
straw
shoes
a
and
a
saucepan
and
she
staggers
under
a
great
bundle
of
canes
on
her
shoulder
poor
old
pilgrim
i
should
like
to
give
the
old
mother
my
horse
and
ease
her
way
to
the
heavenly
city
but
i
reflect
that
this
would
detract
from
the
merit
of
her
pilgrimage
there
are
men
also
as
old
hobbling
along
but
usually
not
so
heavily
laden
one
ancient
couple
are
riding
in
the
deep
flaps
of
a
pannier
hanging
each
side
of
a
mule
they
can
just
see
each
other
across
the
mule
back
but
the
swaying
sickening
motion
of
the
pannier
evidently
lessens
their
interest
in
life
and
in
each
other
our
syrian
allies
are
as
brave
as
usual
the
soudan
babies
did
not
go
to
the
jordan
or
the
dead
sea
and
are
consequently
fresh
and
full
of
antics
the
syrian
armament
has
not
thus
far
been
used
eagles
rabbits
small
game
of
all
sorts
have
been
disregarded
neither
of
the
men
has
unslung
his
gun
or
drawn
his
revolvers
the
hunting
dogs
have
not
once
been
called
on
to
hunt
anything
and
now
they
are
so
exhausted
by
the
heat
that
their
master
is
obliged
to
carry
them
all
the
way
to
jerusalem
one
of
the
hounds
he
has
in
his
arms
and
the
other
is
slung
in
a
pannier
under
the
saddle
his
master
foot
resting
in
the
other
side
to
balance
the
dog
the
poor
creature
looks
out
piteously
from
his
swinging
cradle
it
is
the
most
inglorious
i
have
ever
been
attached
to
our
sheykh
becomes
more
and
more
friendly
he
rides
up
to
me
occasionally
and
nobly
striking
his
breast
exclaims
sheykh
jordan
jerusalem
mar
saba
hebron
all
round
me
sometimes
he
ends
the
interview
with
a
demand
for
tobacco
and
again
with
a
hint
of
the
backsheesh
he
expects
in
jerusalem
i
want
to
tell
him
that
he
is
exactly
like
our
stately
red
man
at
home
with
his
big
injun
we
are
very
glad
to
get
out
of
the
heat
at
noon
and
take
shelter
in
the
rock
grotto
at
the
red
khan
we
sit
here
as
if
in
a
box
at
the
theatre
and
survey
the
passing
show
the
woman
smokes
her
narghileh
again
the
dogs
crouching
at
her
feet
and
the
soudan
babies
are
pretending
to
wait
on
her
and
tumbling
over
each
other
and
spilling
everything
they
attempt
to
carry
the
woman
says
they
are
great
plagues
to
her
and
cost
thirty
napoleons
each
in
soudan
as
we
sit
here
after
lunch
an
endless
procession
passes
before
us
horses
camels
in
long
strings
tied
together
and
pilgrims
of
all
grades
and
as
they
come
up
the
hill
one
after
the
other
showing
their
heads
suddenly
it
is
just
as
if
they
appeared
on
the
stage
and
they
negroes
russians
copts
circassians
greeks
soudan
slaves
and
arab
struck
with
a
upon
seeing
us
and
tarry
long
enough
for
us
to
examine
them
suddenly
presents
himself
a
tall
gayly
dressed
slim
fellow
from
soudan
the
slave
of
the
sheykh
showing
his
white
teeth
and
his
face
beaming
with
he
is
so
peculiarly
black
that
we
ask
him
to
step
forward
for
closer
inspection
who
expresses
great
admiration
for
him
gets
a
coal
from
the
tire
and
holds
it
up
by
his
cheek
the
skin
has
the
advantage
of
the
coal
not
only
in
lustre
but
in
depth
of
blackness
he
says
that
he
is
a
galgam
a
tribe
whose
virtues
endorses
very
sincere
trusty
thim
good
when
we
have
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
galgam
in
this
thorough
manner
he
asks
for
backsheesh
the
doctor
offers
him
a
copper
coin
this
without
any
offence
in
his
manner
and
with
the
utmost
courtesy
he
refuses
bows
very
low
says
with
a
little
irony
and
turns
away
in
a
few
moments
he
comes
back
opens
his
wallet
takes
out
two
silver
franc
pieces
hands
them
to
the
doctor
says
with
a
proud
politeness
bedawee
bows
runs
across
the
hill
catches
his
horse
and
rides
gallantly
away
it
is
beautifully
done
once
or
twice
during
the
ride
to
jerusalem
we
see
him
careering
over
the
hills
and
he
approaches
within
hail
at
bethany
but
he
does
not
lower
his
dignity
by
joining
us
again
the
heat
is
intense
until
we
reach
the
well
within
a
mile
of
bethany
where
we
find
a
great
concourse
of
exhausted
pilgrims
on
the
way
wherever
there
is
an
open
field
that
admits
of
it
we
have
some
display
of
bedawee
horsemanship
the
white
arab
mare
which
the
sheykh
rides
is
of
pure
blood
and
cost
him
although
i
should
select
her
as
a
these
people
ride
abroad
so
to
say
arms
legs
accoutrements
flying
but
they
stick
on
which
is
the
principal
thing
and
the
horses
over
the
rough
ground
soft
fields
and
loose
stones
run
stop
short
wheel
in
a
flash
and
exhibit
wonderful
training
and
bottom
the
high
opinion
we
had
formed
of
the
proud
spirit
and
generosity
of
the
bedawee
by
the
incident
at
the
bed
khan
was
not
to
be
maintained
after
our
return
to
jerusalem
another
of
our
oriental
illusions
was
to
be
destroyed
forever
the
cool
acceptance
by
the
doctor
of
the
two
francs
so
loftily
tendered
as
a
specimen
of
bedawee
backsheesh
was
probably
unexpected
and
perhaps
unprovided
for
by
adequate
financial
arrangements
on
the
part
of
the
galgam
at
any
rate
that
evening
he
was
hovering
about
the
hotel
endeavoring
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
doctor
and
evidently
unwilling
to
believe
that
there
could
exist
in
the
heart
of
the
howadji
the
mean
intention
of
retaining
those
francs
the
next
morning
he
sent
a
friend
to
the
doctor
to
ask
him
for
the
money
the
doctor
replied
that
he
should
never
think
of
returning
a
gift
especially
one
made
with
so
much
courtesy
that
indeed
the
amount
of
the
money
was
naught
but
that
he
should
keep
it
as
a
souvenir
of
the
noble
generosity
of
his
bedawee
friend
this
sort
of
sentiment
seemed
inexplicable
to
the
oriental
mind
the
son
of
the
desert
was
as
much
astonished
that
the
frank
should
retain
his
gift
as
the
spanish
gentleman
who
presents
his
horse
to
his
guest
would
be
if
the
guest
should
take
it
the
offer
of
a
present
in
the
east
is
a
flowery
expression
of
a
sentiment
that
does
not
exist
and
its
acceptance
necessarily
implies
a
return
of
something
of
greater
value
after
another
day
of
anxiety
the
proud
and
handsome
slave
came
in
person
and
begged
for
the
francs
until
he
received
them
he
was
no
better
than
his
master
the
noble
sheykh
who
waylaid
us
during
the
remainder
of
our
stay
for
additional
sixpences
in
backsheesh
o
superb
bedawee
we
did
not
begrudge
the
money
but
our
lost
ideal
and
mar
saba
bethlehem
lies
about
seven
miles
south
of
jerusalem
it
is
also
a
hill
village
reposing
upon
a
stony
promontory
that
is
thrust
out
eastward
from
the
central
the
abrupt
slopes
below
three
sides
of
it
are
terraced
on
the
north
is
a
valley
which
lies
in
a
direct
line
between
it
and
jerusalem
on
the
east
are
the
yawning
ravines
and
the
leading
to
the
dead
sea
on
the
south
is
the
wild
country
towards
hebron
and
the
sharp
summit
of
the
frank
mountain
in
the
distance
the
village
lies
on
the
ridge
and
on
the
point
at
the
east
end
of
it
overlooking
a
vast
extent
of
seamed
and
rocky
and
jagged
country
is
the
gloomy
pile
of
convents
chapels
and
churches
that
mark
the
spot
of
the
nativity
from
its
earliest
mention
till
now
the
home
of
shepherds
and
of
hardy
cultivators
of
its
rocky
hillsides
it
has
been
noted
for
the
free
spirit
and
turbulence
of
its
inhabitants
the
primal
character
of
a
place
seems
to
have
the
power
of
perpetuating
itself
in
all
changes
bethlehem
never
seems
to
have
been
afflicted
with
servility
during
the
period
of
david
hiding
in
the
cave
adullam
the
warlike
philistines
occupied
it
but
david
was
a
fit
representative
of
the
pluck
and
steadfastness
of
its
people
since
the
christian
era
it
has
been
a
christian
town
as
it
is
and
the
few
moslems
who
have
settled
there
from
time
to
time
have
found
it
more
prudent
to
withdraw
than
to
brave
its
hostility
its
women
incline
to
be
handsome
and
have
rather
european
than
oriental
features
and
they
enjoy
the
reputation
of
unusual
virtue
the
men
are
industrious
and
seem
to
have
more
selfrespect
than
the
syrians
generally
bethlehem
is
to
all
the
world
one
of
the
sweetest
of
words
a
tender
and
romantic
interest
is
thrown
about
it
as
the
of
rachel
as
the
scene
of
ruth
primitive
story
and
of
david
boyhood
and
kingly
consecration
so
that
no
other
place
in
judæa
by
its
associations
was
so
fit
to
be
the
gate
through
which
the
divine
child
should
come
into
the
world
and
the
traveller
can
visit
it
with
perhaps
less
shock
to
his
feelings
of
reverence
certainly
with
a
purer
and
simpler
enjoyment
than
any
other
place
in
holy
land
he
finds
its
ruggedness
and
desolateness
picturesque
in
the
light
of
old
song
and
story
and
even
the
puerile
inventions
of
monkish
credulity
do
not
affect
him
as
elsewhere
from
jerusalem
we
reach
bethlehem
by
following
a
curving
ridge
lovely
upland
ride
on
account
of
the
extensive
prospect
and
the
breeze
and
because
it
is
always
a
relief
to
get
out
of
the
city
the
country
is
however
as
stony
as
the
worst
portions
of
new
england
mountain
thick
double
enclosing
small
fields
do
not
begin
to
exhaust
the
stones
on
both
sides
of
the
ridge
are
bare
unproductive
hills
but
the
sides
of
the
valleys
are
terraced
and
covered
with
a
good
growth
of
these
hollows
were
no
doubt
once
very
fruitful
by
assiduous
cultivation
in
spite
of
the
stones
bethlehem
as
we
saw
it
across
a
deep
ravine
was
like
a
castle
on
a
hill
there
is
nowhere
level
ground
enough
for
a
table
to
stand
off
the
ridges
and
we
looked
in
vain
for
the
of
about
which
we
had
tried
trustfully
to
sing
in
youth
within
a
mile
of
bethlehem
gate
we
came
to
the
tomb
of
rachel
standing
close
by
the
highway
rachel
died
and
was
buried
in
the
way
to
ephrath
which
is
bethlehem
and
jacob
set
a
pillar
upon
her
grave
that
is
the
pillar
of
rachel
grave
unto
this
this
is
the
testimony
of
the
author
of
genesis
who
had
not
seen
the
pillar
which
remained
to
his
day
but
repeated
the
tradition
of
the
sons
of
jacob
what
remained
of
this
pillar
after
the
absence
of
the
israelites
for
some
five
centuries
from
bethlehem
is
uncertain
but
it
may
be
supposed
that
some
spot
near
bethlehem
was
identified
as
the
tomb
of
rachel
upon
their
return
and
that
the
present
site
is
the
one
then
selected
it
is
possible
of
course
that
the
tradition
of
the
pagan
canaanites
may
have
preserved
the
recollection
of
the
precise
spot
at
any
rate
christians
seem
to
agree
that
this
is
one
of
the
few
ancient
sites
in
judæa
which
are
authentic
and
the
moslems
pay
it
equal
veneration
the
square
unpretentious
building
erected
over
it
is
of
modern
construction
and
the
pilgrim
has
to
content
himself
with
looking
at
a
sort
of
moslem
tomb
inside
and
reflecting
if
he
can
upon
the
pathetic
story
of
the
death
of
the
mother
of
joseph
there
is
alas
everywhere
in
judæa
something
to
drive
away
sentiment
as
well
as
pious
feeling
the
tomb
of
rachel
is
now
surrounded
by
a
moslem
cemetery
and
as
we
happened
to
be
there
on
thursday
we
found
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
a
great
gathering
of
women
who
had
come
there
according
to
their
weekly
custom
to
weep
and
to
you
would
not
see
in
farthest
nubia
a
more
barbarous
assemblage
and
not
so
fierce
an
one
in
the
presence
of
these
wild
mourners
the
term
has
a
ludicrous
sound
yet
we
ought
not
to
forget
that
we
were
intruders
upon
their
periodic
grief
attracted
to
their
religious
demonstration
merely
by
curiosity
and
fairly
entitled
to
nothing
but
scowls
and
signs
of
aversion
i
am
sure
that
we
should
give
bold
moslem
intruders
upon
our
hours
of
sorrow
at
home
no
better
reception
the
women
were
in
the
usual
syrian
costume
their
loose
gowns
gaped
open
at
the
bosom
and
they
were
without
veils
and
made
no
pretence
of
drawing
a
shawl
before
their
faces
all
wore
necklaces
of
coins
and
many
of
them
had
circlets
of
coins
on
the
head
with
strips
depending
from
them
also
stiff
with
silver
pieces
a
woman
worth
was
thus
easily
to
be
reckoned
for
her
entire
fortune
was
on
her
head
a
pretty
face
was
here
and
there
to
be
seen
but
most
of
them
were
flaringly
ugly
liken
them
to
what
they
most
and
mentally
the
type
of
the
north
american
squaws
they
were
accompanied
by
all
their
children
and
the
little
brats
were
tumbling
about
the
tombs
and
learning
the
language
of
woe
among
the
hundreds
of
women
present
the
expression
of
grief
took
two
forms
active
the
other
more
resigned
a
group
seated
itself
about
a
tomb
and
the
members
swayed
their
bodies
to
and
fro
howled
at
the
top
of
their
voices
and
pretended
to
weep
i
had
the
infidel
curiosity
to
go
from
group
to
group
in
search
of
a
tear
but
i
did
not
see
one
occasionally
some
interruption
like
the
arrival
of
a
new
mourner
would
cause
the
swaying
and
howling
to
cease
for
a
moment
or
it
would
now
and
then
be
temporarily
left
to
the
woman
at
the
head
of
the
grave
but
presently
all
would
fall
to
again
and
abandon
themselves
to
the
luxury
of
agony
it
was
perhaps
unreasonable
to
expect
tears
from
creatures
so
withered
as
most
of
these
were
but
they
worked
themselves
into
a
frenzy
of
excitement
they
rolled
up
their
blue
checked
cotton
handkerchiefs
drew
them
across
their
eyes
and
then
wrung
them
out
with
gestures
of
despair
it
was
the
dryest
grief
i
ever
saw
the
more
active
mourners
formed
a
ring
in
a
clear
spot
some
thirty
women
standing
with
their
faces
toward
the
centre
their
hands
on
each
other
shoulders
circled
round
with
unrhythmic
steps
crying
and
singing
and
occasionally
jumping
up
and
down
with
all
their
energy
like
the
dancers
of
horace
the
ground
with
equal
feet
coming
down
upon
the
earth
with
a
heavy
thud
at
the
same
time
slapping
their
faces
with
their
hands
then
circling
around
again
with
faster
steps
and
shriller
cries
and
more
prolonged
ululations
and
anon
pausing
to
jump
and
beat
the
ground
with
a
violence
sufficient
to
shatter
their
frames
the
loose
flowing
robes
the
clinking
of
the
silver
ornaments
the
wild
gleam
of
their
eyes
the
bacchantic
madness
of
their
saltations
the
shrill
shrieking
and
wailing
conspired
to
give
their
demonstration
an
indescribable
barbarity
this
scene
has
recurred
every
thursday
for
i
suppose
hundreds
of
years
within
a
mile
of
the
birthplace
of
jesus
bethlehem
at
a
little
distance
presents
an
appearance
that
its
interior
does
not
maintain
but
it
is
so
much
better
than
most
syrian
villages
of
its
size
it
has
a
population
of
about
three
thousand
and
is
so
much
cleaner
than
jerusalem
that
we
are
content
with
its
ancient
though
commonplace
aspect
but
the
atmosphere
of
the
town
is
thoroughly
commercial
or
perhaps
i
should
say
industrial
you
do
not
find
in
it
that
rural
and
reposeful
air
which
you
associate
with
the
birthplace
of
our
lord
the
people
are
sharp
to
a
woman
and
have
a
keen
eye
for
the
purse
of
the
stranger
every
other
house
is
a
shop
for
the
manufacture
or
sale
of
some
of
the
bethlehem
specialties
in
and
ivory
and
crosses
and
crucifixes
and
models
of
the
holy
sepulchre
and
every
sort
of
sacred
trinket
and
beads
in
endless
variety
a
little
is
done
also
in
especially
in
rings
one
may
chance
upon
a
mecca
ring
there
but
the
ring
peculiar
to
bethlehem
is
a
silver
it
is
a
broad
and
singular
band
of
silver
with
pendants
and
is
worn
upon
the
thumb
as
soon
as
we
come
into
the
town
we
are
beset
with
sellers
of
various
wares
and
we
never
escape
them
except
when
we
are
in
the
convent
the
latin
convent
opens
its
doors
to
tourists
it
is
a
hospitable
house
and
the
monks
are
very
civil
they
let
us
sit
in
a
while
waiting
for
dinner
that
was
as
damp
and
chill
as
a
dungeon
and
they
gave
us
a
but
uneatable
meal
and
the
most
peculiar
wine
all
at
a
good
price
the
wine
white
and
red
was
made
by
the
monks
they
said
with
some
pride
we
tried
both
kinds
and
i
can
recommend
it
to
the
american
temperance
union
if
it
can
be
introduced
to
the
public
the
public
will
embrace
total
abstinence
with
enthusiasm
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
proper
hour
to
visit
the
crypt
of
the
nativity
we
went
out
upon
the
esplanade
before
the
convent
and
looked
down
into
the
terraced
ravines
which
are
endeared
to
us
by
so
many
associations
somewhere
down
there
is
the
patch
of
ground
that
the
mighty
man
of
wealth
boaz
owned
in
which
sweet
ruth
went
gleaning
in
the
what
a
picture
of
a
primitive
time
it
is
noonday
meal
of
boaz
and
his
handmaidens
ruth
invited
to
join
them
and
dip
her
morsel
in
the
vinegar
with
the
rest
and
the
hospitable
boaz
handing
her
parched
corn
we
can
understand
why
ruth
had
good
gleaning
over
this
stony
ground
after
the
rakes
of
the
handmaidens
we
know
that
her
dress
did
not
differ
from
that
worn
by
oriental
women
now
for
her
which
boaz
filled
with
six
measures
of
barley
was
the
still
almost
universally
worn
not
by
the
bethlehemite
women
their
is
peculiar
there
seems
to
be
on
top
of
the
head
a
square
frame
and
over
this
is
thrown
and
folded
a
piece
of
white
doth
the
women
are
thus
in
a
manner
crowned
and
the
dress
is
as
becoming
as
the
somewhat
similar
of
the
roman
peasants
we
learn
also
in
the
story
of
ruth
that
the
in
her
day
was
as
wise
in
the
ways
of
men
as
she
is
now
still
my
daughter
she
counselled
her
after
she
returned
with
the
veil
full
of
barley
thou
know
how
the
matter
will
fall
for
the
man
will
not
be
in
rest
until
he
have
finished
the
thing
this
down
there
somewhere
in
that
wilderness
of
ravines
david
the
of
ruth
kept
his
father
sheep
before
he
went
to
the
combat
with
goliath
it
was
grotto
is
shown
a
little
more
than
a
mile
from
this
the
shepherds
watched
their
flocks
by
night
when
the
angel
appeared
and
announced
the
birth
of
the
messiah
the
son
of
david
we
have
here
within
the
grasp
of
the
eye
almost
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
old
dispensation
from
the
burial
of
rachel
to
the
birth
of
our
lord
from
the
passing
of
the
wandering
sheykh
jacob
with
his
family
to
the
end
put
to
the
exclusive
pretensions
of
his
descendants
by
the
coming
of
a
saviour
to
all
the
world
the
cave
called
the
grotto
of
the
nativity
has
great
antiquity
the
says
it
had
this
repute
as
early
as
the
second
century
in
the
year
the
mother
of
constantine
built
a
church
over
it
and
this
basilica
still
stands
and
is
the
oldest
specimen
of
christian
architecture
in
existence
except
perhaps
the
lower
church
of
clement
at
rome
it
is
the
oldest
basilica
above
ground
retaining
its
perfect
ancient
form
the
main
part
of
the
church
consists
of
a
nave
and
four
aisles
separated
by
four
rows
of
corinthian
marble
columns
tradition
says
taken
from
the
temple
of
solomon
the
walls
were
once
adorned
with
mosaics
but
only
fragments
of
them
remain
the
roof
is
decayed
and
leaky
the
pavement
is
broken
this
part
of
the
church
is
wholly
neglected
because
it
belongs
to
the
several
sects
in
common
and
is
merely
the
arena
for
an
occasional
fight
the
choir
is
separated
from
the
nave
by
a
wall
and
is
divided
into
two
chapels
one
of
the
greeks
the
other
of
the
armenians
the
grotto
of
the
nativity
is
underneath
these
chapels
and
each
sect
has
a
separate
staircase
of
descent
to
it
the
latin
chapel
is
on
the
north
side
of
this
choir
and
it
also
has
a
stairway
to
the
subterranean
apartments
making
an
effort
to
believe
that
the
stable
of
the
inn
in
which
christ
was
born
was
a
small
subterranean
cave
cut
in
the
solid
rock
we
descended
a
winding
flight
of
stairs
from
the
latin
chapel
with
a
monk
for
our
guide
and
entered
a
labyrinth
from
which
we
did
not
emerge
until
we
reached
the
place
of
the
nativity
and
ascended
into
the
greek
chapel
above
it
we
walked
between
glistening
walls
of
rock
illuminated
by
here
and
there
and
in
our
exploration
of
the
gloomy
passages
and
chambers
encountered
shrines
pictures
and
tombs
of
the
sainted
we
saw
or
were
told
that
we
saw
the
spot
to
which
joseph
retired
at
the
moment
of
the
nativity
and
also
the
place
where
the
twenty
thousand
children
who
were
murdered
by
the
order
of
ghastly
subject
so
well
improved
by
the
painters
of
the
buried
but
there
was
one
chamber
or
rather
vault
that
we
entered
with
genuine
emotion
this
was
the
cell
of
jerome
hermit
and
scholar
whose
writings
have
gained
him
the
title
of
father
of
the
church
at
the
close
of
the
fourth
century
bethlehem
was
chiefly
famous
as
the
retreat
of
this
holy
student
and
the
fame
of
his
learning
and
sanctity
drew
to
it
from
distant
lands
many
faithful
women
who
renounced
the
world
and
its
pleasures
and
were
content
to
sit
at
his
feet
and
learn
the
way
of
life
among
those
who
resigned
and
for
his
sake
and
the
cross
despised
the
allurements
and
honors
of
the
roman
world
was
the
devout
paula
a
roman
matron
who
traced
her
origin
from
agamemnon
and
numbered
the
scipios
and
gracchi
among
her
ancestors
while
her
husband
joxotius
deduced
a
no
less
royal
lineage
from
æneas
her
wealth
was
sufficient
to
support
the
dignity
of
such
a
descent
among
her
possessions
an
item
in
her
was
the
city
of
nicopolis
which
augustus
built
as
a
monument
of
the
victory
of
actium
by
the
advice
and
in
the
company
of
jerome
her
spiritual
guide
she
abandoned
rome
and
all
her
vast
estates
and
even
her
infant
son
and
retired
to
the
holy
village
of
bethlehem
the
great
jerome
who
wrote
her
biography
and
transmitted
the
story
of
her
virtues
to
the
most
distant
ages
bestowed
upon
her
the
singular
title
of
the
of
god
she
was
buried
here
and
we
look
upon
her
tomb
with
scarcely
less
interest
than
that
of
jerome
himself
who
also
rests
in
this
thrice
holy
ground
at
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
century
when
the
goths
sacked
rome
a
crowd
of
the
noble
and
the
rich
escaping
with
nothing
saved
from
the
wreck
but
life
and
honor
attracted
also
by
the
reputation
of
jerome
appeared
as
beggars
in
the
streets
of
this
humble
village
no
doubt
they
thronged
to
the
cell
of
the
venerable
father
there
is
i
suppose
no
doubt
that
this
is
the
study
in
which
he
composed
many
of
his
more
important
treatises
it
is
a
vaulted
chamber
about
twenty
feet
square
by
nine
feet
high
there
is
in
venice
a
picture
of
the
study
of
jerome
painted
by
carpaccio
which
represents
a
delightful
apartment
the
saint
is
seen
in
his
study
in
a
rich
négligé
robe
at
the
side
of
his
desk
are
musical
instruments
and
sheets
of
music
as
if
he
were
accustomed
to
give
soirées
on
the
are
greek
vases
and
other
objects
of
virtu
and
in
the
middle
of
the
room
is
a
of
the
most
worldly
and
useless
of
the
canine
breed
the
artist
should
have
seen
the
real
study
of
the
hermit
grim
unornamented
vault
in
which
he
passed
his
days
in
mortifications
of
the
body
hearing
always
ringing
in
his
ears
in
his
disordered
mental
and
physical
condition
the
last
trump
of
judgment
we
passed
groping
our
way
along
in
this
religious
cellar
through
a
winding
narrow
passage
in
the
rock
some
feet
long
and
came
into
the
place
of
places
the
very
chapel
of
the
nativity
in
this
low
vault
feet
long
and
eleven
feet
wide
hewn
in
the
rock
is
an
altar
at
one
end
before
this
we
can
see
everything
with
distinctness
for
sixteen
silver
lamps
are
burning
about
is
a
marble
slab
in
the
pavement
into
which
is
let
a
silver
star
with
this
sentence
round
it
hic
de
virgine
maria
jesus
christus
natus
est
the
guardian
of
this
sacred
spot
was
a
turkish
soldier
who
stood
there
with
his
gun
and
fixed
bayonet
an
attitude
which
experience
has
taught
him
is
necessary
to
keep
the
peace
among
the
christians
who
meet
here
the
altar
is
without
furniture
and
is
draped
by
each
sect
which
uses
it
in
turn
near
by
is
the
chapel
of
the
but
the
manger
in
which
christ
was
laid
is
in
the
church
of
santa
maria
maggiore
in
rome
there
is
in
bethlehem
another
ancient
cave
which
is
almost
as
famous
as
that
of
the
nativity
it
is
called
the
milk
grotto
and
during
all
ages
of
the
church
a
most
marvellous
virtue
has
attached
to
it
fragments
of
the
stone
have
been
and
still
continue
to
be
broken
off
and
sent
into
all
christian
countries
women
also
make
pilgrimages
to
it
in
faith
the
grotto
is
on
the
edge
of
the
town
overlooking
the
eastern
ravines
and
is
arranged
as
a
in
our
walk
thither
a
stately
bedawee
as
by
accident
fell
into
our
company
and
acted
as
our
cicerone
he
was
desirous
that
we
should
know
that
he
also
was
a
man
of
the
world
and
of
travel
and
rated
at
its
proper
value
this
little
corner
of
the
earth
he
had
served
in
the
french
army
and
taken
part
in
many
battles
and
had
been
in
paris
and
seen
the
tomb
of
the
great
emperor
there
was
a
man
as
to
this
grotto
they
say
that
the
virgin
used
to
send
to
it
for
milk
think
so
as
for
him
he
was
a
soldier
and
did
not
much
give
his
mind
to
such
things
this
grotto
is
an
excavation
in
the
chalky
rock
and
might
be
a
very
good
place
to
store
milk
but
for
the
popular
prejudice
in
cities
against
chalk
and
water
we
entered
it
through
the
court
of
a
private
house
and
the
damsel
who
admitted
us
also
assured
us
that
the
virgin
procured
milk
from
it
the
tradition
is
that
the
virgin
and
child
were
concealed
here
for
a
time
before
the
flight
into
egypt
and
ever
since
then
its
stone
has
the
miraculous
power
of
increasing
the
flow
of
the
maternal
breast
the
early
fathers
encouraged
this
and
the
like
superstitions
in
the
docile
minds
of
their
fair
converts
and
themselves
testified
to
the
efficacy
of
this
remarkable
stone
these
superstitions
belong
rather
to
the
orient
than
to
any
form
of
religion
there
is
a
famous
spring
at
assiout
in
egypt
which
was
for
centuries
much
resorted
to
by
ladies
who
desired
offspring
and
the
arabs
on
the
upper
nile
who
wish
for
an
heir
male
resort
to
a
plant
which
grows
in
the
remote
desert
rare
and
difficult
to
find
the
leaves
of
which
are
for
this
grotto
scarcely
repays
the
visit
except
for
the
view
one
obtains
of
the
wild
country
below
it
when
we
bade
good
by
to
the
courtly
arab
we
had
too
much
delicacy
to
offer
money
to
such
a
gentleman
and
a
soldier
of
the
empire
a
delicacy
not
shared
by
him
however
for
he
let
no
false
modesty
hinder
a
request
for
a
little
backsheesh
for
tobacco
on
our
return
and
at
some
distance
from
the
gate
we
diverged
into
a
lane
and
sought
in
a
rocky
field
the
traditional
well
whose
waters
david
longed
for
when
he
was
in
the
cave
of
adullam
that
one
would
give
me
drink
of
the
water
of
the
well
of
bethlehem
which
is
by
the
gate
howbeit
when
the
three
mighty
men
had
broken
through
the
philistine
guards
and
procured
him
the
water
david
would
not
drink
that
which
was
brought
at
such
a
sacrifice
two
very
comely
bethlehem
girls
hastened
at
our
approach
to
draw
water
from
the
well
and
gave
us
to
drink
with
all
the
freedom
of
oriental
hospitality
in
which
there
is
always
an
expectation
of
backsheesh
the
water
is
at
any
rate
very
good
and
there
is
no
reason
why
these
pretty
girls
should
not
turn
an
honest
penny
upon
the
strength
of
david
thirst
whether
this
be
the
well
whose
water
he
desired
or
not
we
were
only
too
thankful
that
no
miraculous
property
is
attributed
to
its
waters
as
we
returned
we
had
the
evening
light
upon
the
gray
walls
and
towers
of
the
city
and
were
able
to
invest
it
with
something
of
its
historical
dignity
the
next
excursion
that
we
made
from
jerusalem
was
so
different
from
the
one
to
bethlehem
that
by
way
of
contrast
i
put
them
together
it
was
to
the
convent
of
mar
saba
which
lies
in
the
wilderness
towards
the
dead
sea
about
two
hours
and
a
half
from
the
city
in
those
good
old
days
when
piety
was
measured
by
frugality
in
the
use
of
the
bath
when
the
holy
fathers
praised
most
those
hermits
who
washed
least
when
it
might
perhaps
be
the
boast
of
more
than
one
virgin
devoted
to
the
ascetic
life
that
she
had
lived
years
during
which
water
had
touched
neither
her
hands
her
face
her
feet
nor
any
part
of
her
body
palestine
was
after
egypt
the
favorite
resort
of
the
fanatical
the
unfortunate
and
the
lazy
who
gathered
into
communities
or
dwelling
in
solitary
caves
offered
to
the
barbarian
world
a
spectacle
of
superstition
and
abasement
under
the
name
of
christianity
but
of
the
swarm
of
hermits
and
monks
who
begged
in
the
cities
and
burrowed
in
the
caves
of
the
holy
land
in
the
fifth
century
no
one
may
perhaps
be
spoken
of
with
more
respect
than
sabas
who
besides
a
reputation
for
sanctity
has
left
that
of
manliness
and
a
virile
ability
which
his
did
not
extirpate
and
of
all
the
monasteries
of
that
period
that
of
mar
saba
is
the
only
one
in
judæa
which
has
preserved
almost
unbroken
the
type
of
that
time
sabas
was
a
cappadocian
who
came
to
palestine
in
search
of
a
permanent
retreat
savage
enough
to
satisfy
his
austere
soul
he
found
it
in
a
cave
in
one
of
the
wildest
gorges
in
this
most
desolate
of
lands
a
ravine
which
opens
into
the
mountains
from
the
brook
kidron
the
fame
of
his
zeal
and
piety
attracted
thousands
to
his
neighborhood
so
that
at
one
time
there
were
almost
as
many
hermits
roosting
about
in
the
rocks
near
him
as
there
are
inhabitants
in
the
city
of
jerusalem
now
he
was
once
enabled
to
lead
an
army
of
monks
to
that
city
and
chastise
the
monophysite
heretics
his
cave
in
the
steep
side
of
a
rocky
precipice
became
the
nucleus
of
his
convent
which
grew
around
it
and
attached
itself
to
the
face
of
the
rock
as
best
it
could
for
the
convent
of
mar
saba
is
not
a
building
nor
a
collection
of
buildings
so
much
as
it
is
a
group
of
nests
attached
to
the
side
of
a
precipice
it
was
a
bright
saturday
afternoon
that
a
young
divinity
student
and
i
taking
the
volatile
demetrius
with
us
for
interpreter
rode
out
of
stephen
gate
into
jehoshaphat
past
the
gray
field
of
jewish
graves
down
through
tophet
and
the
wild
ravine
of
the
kidron
it
is
unpleasant
to
interrupt
the
prosperous
start
of
a
pilgrimage
by
a
trifling
incident
but
at
our
first
descent
and
the
slightest
tension
on
the
of
my
horse
they
parted
from
the
bit
this
accident
which
might
be
serious
in
other
lands
is
of
the
sort
that
is
anticipated
here
and
i
may
say
assured
by
the
forethought
of
the
owners
of
upon
dismounting
with
as
much
haste
as
dignity
i
discovered
that
the
reins
had
been
fastened
to
the
bit
by
a
single
rotten
string
of
cotton
luckily
the
horse
i
rode
was
not
an
animal
to
take
advantage
of
the
weakness
of
his
toggery
he
was
a
syrian
horse
a
light
sorrel
and
had
no
one
of
the
good
points
of
a
horse
except
the
name
and
general
shape
his
walk
was
slow
and
reluctant
his
trot
a
high
and
jolt
his
gallop
a
large
agitation
to
his
bridle
of
strings
and
shreds
no
martingale
was
attached
no
horse
in
syria
is
subject
to
that
restraint
when
i
pull
the
bit
he
sticks
up
his
nose
when
i
switch
him
he
kicks
when
i
hold
him
in
he
wo
go
when
i
let
him
loose
he
goes
on
his
nose
i
dismount
and
look
at
him
with
curiosity
i
wonder
all
the
journey
what
his
forte
is
but
i
never
discover
i
conclude
that
he
is
like
the
emperor
honorius
whom
gibbon
stigmatizes
as
passions
and
consequently
without
yet
he
was
not
so
bad
as
the
roads
and
perhaps
no
horse
would
do
much
better
on
these
stony
and
broken
this
horse
is
not
a
model
for
anything
but
a
but
from
my
observation
i
think
that
great
injustice
has
been
done
to
syrian
horses
by
travellers
who
have
only
themselves
to
blame
for
accidents
which
bring
the
horses
into
disrepute
travellers
are
thrown
from
these
steeds
it
is
a
daily
occurrence
we
heard
continually
that
somebody
had
a
fall
from
his
horse
on
his
way
to
the
jordan
or
to
mar
saba
or
to
nablous
and
was
laid
up
and
it
was
always
in
consequence
of
a
vicious
brute
the
fact
is
that
excellent
ministers
of
the
gospel
and
doctors
of
divinity
and
students
of
the
same
who
have
never
in
their
lives
been
on
the
back
of
a
horse
in
any
other
land
seem
to
think
when
they
come
here
that
the
holy
air
of
palestine
will
transform
them
into
accomplished
horsemen
or
perhaps
they
are
emulous
of
elisha
that
they
may
go
to
heaven
by
means
of
a
fiery
steed
for
a
while
we
had
the
company
of
the
singing
brook
kidron
flowing
clear
over
the
stones
then
we
left
the
ravine
and
wound
over
rocky
steeps
which
afforded
us
fine
views
of
broken
hills
and
interlacing
ridges
and
when
we
again
reached
the
valley
the
brook
had
disappeared
in
the
thirsty
ground
the
road
is
strewn
not
paved
with
stones
and
in
many
places
hardly
practicable
for
horses
occasionally
we
encountered
flocks
of
goats
and
of
sheep
feeding
on
the
scant
grass
of
the
hills
and
tended
by
boys
in
the
coarse
brown
and
striped
garments
of
the
country
which
give
a
aspect
to
most
of
the
inhabitants
there
was
no
other
life
and
no
trees
offer
relief
to
the
hard
landscape
but
the
way
was
now
and
then
bright
with
flowers
thickly
carpeted
with
scarlet
anemones
the
star
of
bethlehem
and
tiny
dandelions
two
hours
from
the
city
we
passed
several
camps
of
bedaween
their
brown
low
tents
pitched
among
the
rocks
and
scarcely
distinguishable
in
the
sombre
landscape
about
the
tents
were
grouped
camels
and
donkeys
and
from
them
issued
and
pursued
us
begging
boys
and
girls
a
lazy
bedawee
appeared
here
and
there
with
a
long
gun
and
we
could
imagine
that
this
gloomy
region
might
be
unsafe
after
nightfall
but
no
danger
ever
seems
possible
in
such
bright
sunshine
and
under
a
sky
so
blue
and
friendly
when
a
from
the
convent
we
turned
to
the
right
from
the
road
to
the
dead
sea
and
ascending
a
steep
hill
found
ourselves
riding
along
the
edge
of
a
deep
winding
gorge
a
brook
flows
at
the
bottom
and
its
sides
are
sheer
precipices
of
rock
generally
parallel
but
occasionally
widening
into
amphitheatres
of
the
most
fantastic
rocky
formation
it
is
on
one
side
of
this
narrow
ravine
that
the
convent
is
built
partly
excavated
in
the
rock
partly
resting
on
jutting
ledges
and
partly
hung
out
in
the
form
of
balconies
clinging
to
the
steep
side
like
a
comb
of
wild
bees
or
wasps
to
a
rock
our
first
note
of
approach
to
it
was
the
sight
of
a
square
tower
and
of
the
roofs
of
buildings
below
us
descending
from
the
road
by
several
short
turns
and
finally
by
two
steep
paved
inclines
we
came
to
a
lofty
wall
in
which
is
a
small
iron
door
as
we
could
go
no
farther
without
aid
from
within
demetrius
shouted
and
soon
we
had
a
response
from
a
slit
in
the
wall
fifty
feet
above
us
to
the
left
we
could
see
no
one
but
the
voice
demanded
who
we
were
and
whether
we
had
a
pass
above
the
slit
from
which
the
angelic
voice
proceeded
a
stone
projected
and
in
this
was
an
opening
for
letting
down
or
drawing
up
articles
this
habit
of
caution
in
regard
to
who
or
what
shall
come
into
the
convent
is
of
course
a
relic
of
the
gone
ages
of
tumult
but
it
is
still
necessary
as
a
safeguard
against
the
wandering
bedaween
who
would
no
doubt
find
means
to
plunder
the
convent
of
its
great
wealth
of
gold
silver
and
jewels
if
they
were
not
at
all
times
rigorously
excluded
the
convent
with
its
walls
and
towers
is
still
a
fortress
strong
enough
to
resist
any
irregular
attempts
of
the
wandering
tribes
it
is
also
necessary
to
strictly
guard
the
convent
against
women
who
in
these
days
of
speculation
if
not
scientific
curiosity
often
knock
impatiently
and
angrily
at
its
gates
and
who
if
admitted
would
in
one
gay
and
chatty
hour
destroy
the
spell
of
holy
seclusion
which
has
been
unbroken
for
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
years
i
know
that
sometimes
it
seems
an
unjust
ordination
of
providence
that
a
woman
can
not
be
a
man
but
i
can
not
join
those
who
upbraid
the
monks
of
mar
saba
for
inhospitality
because
they
refuse
to
admit
women
under
any
circumstances
into
the
precincts
of
the
convent
if
i
do
not
sympathize
with
the
brothers
i
can
understand
their
adhesion
to
the
last
shred
of
independence
which
is
only
to
be
maintained
by
absolute
exclusion
of
the
other
sex
it
is
not
necessary
to
revive
the
defamation
of
the
early
christian
ages
that
the
devil
appeared
oftener
to
the
hermit
in
the
form
of
a
beautiful
woman
than
in
any
other
but
we
may
not
regret
that
there
is
still
one
spot
on
the
face
of
the
earth
if
it
is
no
bigger
than
the
sod
upon
which
noah
pioneer
dove
alighted
in
which
weak
men
may
be
safe
from
the
temptation
the
criticism
and
the
curiosity
of
the
superior
being
there
is
an
airy
tower
on
the
rocks
outside
the
walls
which
women
may
occupy
if
they
can
not
restrain
their
desire
to
lodge
in
this
neighborhood
or
if
night
overtakes
them
here
on
their
way
from
the
dead
sea
there
madame
pfeiffer
miss
martineau
and
other
famous
travellers
of
their
sex
have
found
refuge
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
abused
their
proximity
to
this
retreat
of
shuddering
man
by
estimating
the
piety
of
its
inmates
according
to
their
hospitality
to
women
so
far
as
i
can
learn
this
convent
of
mar
saba
is
now
the
only
retreat
left
on
this
broad
earth
for
man
and
it
seems
to
me
only
reasonable
that
it
should
be
respected
by
his
generous
and
gentle
though
inquisitive
foe
after
further
parley
with
demetrius
and
a
considerable
interval
we
heard
a
bell
ring
and
in
a
few
moments
the
iron
door
opened
and
we
entered
stepping
our
horses
carefully
over
the
stone
threshold
and
showing
our
pass
from
the
jerusalem
patriarch
to
an
attendant
and
came
into
a
sort
of
stable
hewn
in
the
rock
here
we
abandoned
our
horses
and
were
taken
in
charge
by
a
monk
whom
the
bell
had
summoned
from
below
he
conducted
us
down
several
long
flights
of
zigzag
stairs
in
the
rock
amid
hanging
buildings
and
cells
until
we
came
to
what
appears
to
be
a
broad
ledge
in
the
precipice
and
found
ourselves
in
the
central
part
of
this
singular
hive
that
is
in
a
small
court
with
cells
and
rocks
on
one
side
and
the
convent
church
which
overhangs
the
precipice
on
the
other
beside
the
church
and
also
at
another
side
of
the
court
are
buildings
in
which
pilgrims
are
lodged
and
in
the
centre
of
the
court
is
the
tomb
of
sabas
himself
here
our
passports
were
examined
and
we
were
assigned
a
cheerful
and
airy
room
looking
upon
the
court
and
tomb
one
of
the
brothers
soon
brought
us
coffee
and
the
promptness
of
this
hospitality
augured
well
for
the
remainder
of
our
fare
relying
upon
the
reputation
of
the
convent
for
good
cheer
we
had
brought
nothing
with
us
not
so
much
as
a
biscuit
judge
of
our
disgust
then
at
hearing
the
following
dialogue
between
demetrius
and
the
greek
monk
time
can
the
gentlemen
dine
time
they
have
you
for
dinner
can
give
us
no
dinner
be
sure
not
it
is
we
have
a
morsel
we
shall
i
can
find
a
little
else
have
very
good
we
interposed
us
a
chicken
give
us
a
few
oysters
stewed
or
broiled
we
are
not
this
levity
which
was
born
of
desperation
for
the
jolting
ride
from
jerusalem
had
indisposed
us
to
keep
a
fast
especially
a
fast
established
by
a
church
the
orthodoxy
of
whose
creed
we
had
strong
reasons
to
doubt
did
not
affect
the
monk
he
replied
it
is
we
shrunk
our
requisition
to
eggs
i
can
find
an
egg
i
will
and
the
brother
departed
with
carte
blanche
from
us
to
squeeze
his
entire
establishment
alas
fasting
is
not
in
mar
saba
what
it
is
in
new
england
where
an
appointed
is
hailed
as
an
opportunity
to
forego
lunch
in
order
to
have
an
extraordinary
appetite
for
a
better
dinner
than
usual
the
tomb
of
sabas
the
central
worship
of
this
hive
is
a
little
plastered
hut
in
the
middle
of
the
court
the
interior
is
decorated
with
pictures
in
the
byzantine
style
and
a
lamp
is
always
burning
there
as
we
stood
at
the
tomb
we
heard
voices
chanting
and
turning
towards
the
rock
we
saw
a
door
from
which
the
sound
came
pushing
it
open
we
were
admitted
into
a
large
chapel
excavated
in
the
rock
the
service
of
vespers
was
in
progress
and
a
band
of
russian
pilgrims
were
chanting
in
rich
bass
voices
producing
more
melody
than
i
had
ever
heard
in
a
greek
church
the
excavation
extends
some
distance
into
the
hill
we
were
shown
the
cells
of
john
of
damascus
and
other
hermits
and
at
the
end
a
piled
full
of
the
bones
of
men
in
the
dim
light
their
skulls
grinned
at
us
in
a
horrid
familiarity
in
that
ghastly
jocularity
which
a
skull
always
puts
on
with
a
kind
of
mocking
commentary
upon
the
strong
chant
of
the
pilgrims
which
reverberated
in
all
the
recesses
of
the
gloomy
cave
hearty
voices
such
as
these
skulls
have
heard
if
they
can
hear
for
many
centuries
the
pilgrims
come
and
chant
and
depart
generation
after
generation
the
bones
and
skulls
of
the
fourteen
thousand
martyrs
in
this
enjoy
a
sort
of
repulsive
immortality
the
monk
who
was
our
guide
appeared
to
care
no
more
for
the
remains
of
the
martyrs
than
for
the
presence
of
the
pilgrims
in
visiting
such
storehouses
one
can
not
but
be
struck
by
the
light
familiarity
with
the
relics
and
insignia
of
death
which
the
monks
have
acquired
this
john
of
damascus
whose
remains
repose
here
was
a
fiery
character
in
his
day
and
favored
by
a
special
miracle
before
he
became
a
saint
he
so
distinguished
himself
by
his
invectives
against
leo
and
constantine
and
other
iconoclast
emperors
at
constantinople
who
in
the
eighth
century
attempted
to
extirpate
from
the
catholic
church
that
he
was
sentenced
to
lose
his
right
hand
the
story
is
that
it
was
instantly
restored
by
the
virgin
mary
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
the
superstitious
orient
more
readily
gave
up
idolatry
or
under
the
moslems
than
under
the
christians
as
the
sun
was
setting
we
left
the
pilgrims
chanting
to
the
martyrs
and
hastened
to
explore
the
premises
a
little
before
the
light
should
fade
we
followed
our
guide
up
stairs
and
down
stairs
sometimes
cut
in
the
stone
sometimes
wooden
stairways
along
hanging
galleries
through
corridors
hewn
in
the
rock
amid
cells
and
little
chapels
most
intricate
labyrinth
in
which
the
uninitiated
would
soon
lose
his
way
here
and
there
we
came
suddenly
upon
a
little
garden
spot
as
big
as
a
a
ledge
upon
which
soil
had
been
deposited
we
walked
also
under
we
saw
and
the
single
that
the
convent
boasts
said
to
have
been
planted
by
sabas
himself
the
plan
of
this
establishment
gradually
developed
itself
to
us
it
differs
from
an
ordinary
convent
chiefly
in
this
latter
is
spread
out
flat
on
the
earth
mar
saba
is
set
up
edgewise
put
mar
saba
on
a
plain
and
these
little
garden
spots
and
graperies
would
be
courts
and
squares
amid
buildings
these
galleries
would
be
bridges
these
cells
or
horizontal
caves
would
be
perpendicular
tombs
and
reservoirs
when
we
arrived
we
supposed
that
we
were
almost
the
only
guests
but
we
found
that
the
place
was
full
of
greek
and
russian
pilgrims
we
encountered
them
on
the
terraces
on
the
flat
roofs
in
the
caves
and
in
all
nooks
yet
these
were
not
the
most
pleasing
nor
the
most
animated
tenants
of
the
place
wherever
we
went
the
old
rookery
was
made
cheerful
by
the
twittering
notes
of
black
birds
with
yellow
wings
a
species
of
grakle
which
the
monks
have
domesticated
and
which
breed
in
great
numbers
steeled
as
these
good
brothers
are
against
the
other
sex
we
were
glad
to
discover
this
streak
of
softness
in
their
nature
high
up
on
the
precipice
there
is
a
attached
to
a
little
chapel
and
in
it
hang
twenty
small
bells
which
are
rung
to
call
the
inmates
to
prayer
even
at
this
height
and
indeed
wherever
we
penetrated
we
were
followed
by
the
monotonous
chant
which
issued
from
the
we
passed
by
a
long
row
of
cells
occupied
by
the
monks
but
were
not
permitted
to
look
into
them
nor
were
we
allowed
to
see
the
library
which
is
said
to
be
rich
in
illuminated
manuscripts
the
convent
belongs
to
the
greek
church
its
monks
take
the
usual
vows
of
poverty
chastity
and
obedience
and
fortify
themselves
in
their
holiness
by
opposing
walls
of
adamant
to
all
womankind
there
are
about
fifty
monks
here
at
present
and
uncommonly
fellows
at
all
the
gross
and
greasy
sort
of
monk
that
is
sometimes
met
their
outward
dress
is
very
neat
consisting
of
a
simple
black
gown
and
a
round
high
black
cap
our
dinner
when
it
was
brought
into
our
apartment
answered
very
well
one
idea
of
a
dessert
but
it
was
a
very
good
oriental
dinner
the
chief
articles
were
a
piece
of
hard
black
bread
and
two
boiled
eggs
cold
and
probably
brought
by
some
pilgrim
from
jerusalem
but
besides
there
were
raisins
cheese
figs
oranges
a
bottle
of
golden
wine
and
tea
the
wine
was
worthy
to
be
celebrated
in
classic
verse
none
so
good
is
i
am
sure
made
elsewhere
in
syria
it
was
liquid
sunshine
and
as
it
was
manufactured
by
the
monks
it
gave
us
a
new
respect
for
their
fastidious
taste
the
vaulted
chamber
which
we
occupied
was
furnished
on
three
sides
with
a
low
divan
which
answered
the
double
purpose
of
chairs
and
couch
on
one
side
however
and
elevated
in
the
wall
was
a
long
niche
exactly
like
the
recessed
tombs
in
cathedrals
upon
which
toes
turned
up
lie
the
bronze
or
wooden
figures
of
the
occupants
this
was
the
bed
of
honor
it
was
furnished
with
a
mattress
and
a
thick
counterpane
having
one
sheet
sewed
to
it
with
reluctance
i
accepted
the
distinction
of
climbing
into
it
and
there
i
slept
laid
out
for
all
the
world
like
my
own
effigy
from
the
ceiling
hung
a
dim
which
cast
a
gloom
rather
than
a
light
upon
our
sepulchral
place
of
repose
our
windows
looked
out
towards
the
west
upon
the
court
upon
the
stairs
upon
the
terraces
roofs
holes
caves
grottos
wooden
balconies
steps
entering
the
rock
and
leading
to
cells
and
towards
the
south
along
the
jagged
precipice
the
convent
occupies
the
precipice
from
the
top
nearly
to
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
the
precipice
opposite
is
nearly
perpendicular
close
at
hand
and
permits
no
view
in
that
direction
heaven
is
the
only
object
in
sight
from
this
retreat
before
the
twilight
fell
the
chanting
was
still
going
on
in
the
cavern
monks
and
pilgrims
were
gliding
about
the
court
and
numbers
of
the
latter
were
clustered
in
the
vestibule
of
the
church
in
which
they
were
settling
down
to
lodge
for
the
night
and
high
above
us
i
saw
three
gaudily
attired
bedaween
who
had
accompanied
some
travellers
from
the
dead
sea
leaning
over
the
balustrade
of
the
stairs
and
regarding
the
scene
with
moslem
complacency
the
hive
settled
slowly
to
rest
but
the
place
was
by
no
means
still
at
night
there
was
in
the
court
an
old
pilgrim
who
had
brought
a
cough
from
the
heart
of
russia
who
seemed
to
be
trying
to
cough
himself
inside
out
there
were
other
noises
that
could
not
be
explained
there
was
a
good
deal
of
clattering
about
in
wooden
shoes
every
sound
was
multiplied
and
reduplicated
from
the
echoing
rocks
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
did
not
conduce
to
sleep
not
even
to
an
repose
but
after
looking
from
the
window
upon
the
march
of
the
quiet
stars
after
watching
the
new
moon
disappear
between
the
roofs
and
after
seeing
that
the
door
of
sabas
tomb
was
closed
although
his
light
was
still
burning
i
turned
in
and
after
a
time
during
which
i
was
conscious
that
not
even
vows
of
poverty
chastity
and
obedience
are
respected
by
fleas
i
fell
into
a
light
sleep
from
this
i
was
aroused
by
a
noise
that
seemed
like
the
call
to
judgment
by
the
most
clamorous
jangle
of
discordant
bells
the
twenty
were
ringing
at
once
and
each
in
a
different
key
it
was
not
simply
a
din
it
was
an
earthquake
of
sound
the
peals
were
echoed
from
the
opposite
ledges
and
reverberated
among
the
rocks
and
caves
and
sharp
angles
of
the
convent
until
the
crash
was
intolerable
it
was
worse
than
the
slam
bang
shriek
clang
clash
roar
dissonance
thunder
and
hurricane
with
which
all
musicians
think
it
absolutely
necessary
to
close
any
overture
symphony
or
musical
composition
whatever
however
decent
and
quiet
it
may
be
it
was
enough
to
rouse
the
deafest
pilgrim
to
wake
the
dead
martyrs
and
set
the
fourteen
thousand
skulls
hunting
for
their
bones
to
call
even
sabas
himself
from
his
tomb
i
arose
i
saw
in
the
starlight
figures
moving
about
the
court
monks
in
their
simple
black
gowns
it
was
i
comprehended
then
the
call
to
midnight
prayer
in
the
chapel
and
resolved
not
to
be
disturbed
further
by
it
i
climbed
back
into
my
tomb
but
the
clamor
continued
i
heard
such
a
clatter
of
hobnailed
shoes
on
the
pavement
besides
that
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
got
up
slipped
into
some
of
my
clothes
opened
the
door
and
descended
by
our
winding
private
stairway
into
the
court
the
door
of
sabas
tomb
was
wide
open
were
the
graves
opening
and
the
dead
taking
the
air
did
this
tomb
open
of
its
own
accord
out
of
its
illuminated
interior
would
the
saint
stalk
forth
and
join
this
great
procession
the
reveille
of
the
quick
and
the
slow
from
above
and
from
below
up
stairs
and
down
stairs
out
of
caves
and
grottos
and
all
odd
the
monks
and
pilgrims
were
pouring
and
streaming
into
the
court
and
the
bells
incessantly
called
more
and
more
importunately
as
the
loiterers
delayed
the
church
was
open
and
lighted
at
the
altar
end
i
glided
in
with
the
other
ghostly
hastily
clad
and
yawning
pilgrims
the
screen
at
the
apse
before
the
holy
place
a
mass
of
silver
and
gilding
sparkled
in
the
candlelight
the
cross
above
it
gleamed
like
a
revelation
out
of
the
gloom
but
half
of
the
church
was
in
heavy
shadow
from
the
penetralia
came
the
sound
of
priestly
chanting
in
the
wooden
stalls
along
each
side
of
the
church
stood
facing
the
altar
the
black
and
motionless
figures
of
the
brothers
the
pilgrims
were
crowding
and
jostling
in
at
the
door
a
brother
gave
me
a
stall
near
the
door
and
i
stood
in
it
as
as
i
could
and
became
a
brother
for
the
time
being
at
the
left
of
the
door
stood
a
monk
with
impassive
face
before
him
on
a
table
were
piles
of
wax
tapers
and
a
solitary
lighted
candle
every
pilgrim
who
entered
bought
a
taper
and
paid
two
coppers
for
it
if
he
had
not
the
change
the
monk
gave
him
change
and
the
pilgrim
carefully
counted
what
he
received
and
objected
to
any
piece
he
thought
not
current
you
may
wake
these
people
up
any
time
of
night
and
find
their
perceptions
about
money
unobscured
the
seller
never
looked
at
the
buyer
nor
at
anything
except
the
tapers
and
the
money
the
pilgrims
were
of
all
ages
and
grades
very
old
men
stout
men
and
young
athletic
fellows
there
were
russians
from
all
the
provinces
greeks
from
the
isles
with
long
black
locks
and
dark
eyes
in
fancy
embroidered
jackets
and
leggins
swarthy
bandits
and
midnight
pirates
in
appearance
but
it
tends
to
make
anybody
look
like
a
pirate
to
wake
him
up
at
twelve
at
night
and
haul
him
into
the
light
with
no
time
to
comb
his
hair
i
dare
say
that
i
may
have
appeared
to
these
honest
people
like
a
western
and
yet
i
should
rather
meet
some
of
those
greeks
in
a
lighted
church
than
outside
the
walls
at
midnight
each
pilgrim
knelt
and
bowed
himself
then
lighted
his
taper
and
placed
it
on
one
of
the
tripods
before
the
screen
in
time
the
church
was
very
fairly
illuminated
and
nearly
filled
with
standing
worshippers
bowing
crossing
themselves
and
responding
to
the
reading
and
chanting
in
low
murmurs
the
chanting
was
a
very
nasal
intoning
usually
slow
but
now
and
then
breaking
into
a
lively
gallop
the
assemblage
quiet
and
respectful
but
clad
in
all
the
vagaries
of
oriental
colors
and
rags
contained
some
faces
that
appeared
very
wild
in
the
when
the
service
had
gone
on
half
an
hour
a
priest
came
out
with
a
tinkling
censer
and
incensed
carefully
every
nook
and
corner
and
person
even
the
vestibule
where
some
of
the
pilgrims
slept
which
needed
it
until
the
church
was
filled
with
smoke
and
perfume
the
performance
went
on
for
an
hour
or
more
but
i
crept
back
to
bed
long
before
it
was
over
and
fell
to
sleep
on
the
drone
of
the
intoning
we
were
up
before
sunrise
on
sunday
morning
the
pilgrims
were
already
leaving
for
jerusalem
there
was
no
trace
of
the
last
night
revelry
everything
was
commonplace
in
the
bright
daylight
we
were
served
with
coffee
and
then
finished
our
exploration
of
the
premises
that
which
we
had
postponed
as
the
most
interesting
sight
was
the
cell
of
sabas
it
is
a
natural
grotto
in
the
rock
somewhat
enlarged
either
by
the
saint
or
by
his
successors
when
sabas
first
came
to
this
spot
he
found
a
lion
in
possession
it
was
not
the
worst
kind
of
a
lion
but
a
sort
of
judæan
lion
one
of
those
meek
beasts
over
whom
the
ancient
hermits
had
so
much
control
sabas
looked
at
the
cave
and
at
the
lion
but
the
cave
suited
him
better
than
the
lion
the
lion
looked
at
the
saint
and
evidently
knew
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
for
the
lions
in
those
days
were
nearly
as
intelligent
as
anybody
else
and
then
sabas
told
the
lion
to
go
away
that
he
wanted
that
lodging
for
himself
and
the
lion
without
a
growl
put
his
tail
down
and
immediately
went
away
there
is
a
picture
of
this
interview
still
preserved
at
the
convent
and
any
one
can
see
that
it
is
probable
that
such
a
lion
as
the
artist
has
represented
would
move
on
when
requested
to
do
so
in
the
cave
is
a
little
recess
the
entrance
to
which
is
a
small
hole
a
recess
just
large
enough
to
accommodate
a
person
in
a
sitting
posture
in
this
place
sabas
sat
for
seven
years
without
once
coming
out
that
was
before
the
present
walls
were
built
in
front
of
the
grotto
and
he
had
some
light
sat
seven
years
on
that
hard
stone
as
long
as
the
present
french
assembly
intends
to
sit
it
was
with
him
also
a
provisional
sitting
in
fact
a
septennate
in
the
as
we
were
departing
were
displayed
articles
to
sell
to
the
pious
pilgrims
canes
from
the
jordan
crosses
painted
and
inlaid
with
cedar
or
olive
wood
or
some
sort
of
jordan
timber
rude
paintings
of
the
order
done
by
the
monks
george
and
the
dragon
being
the
favorite
subject
hyperbolical
pictures
of
the
convent
and
the
saint
stamped
in
black
upon
cotton
cloth
and
holy
in
tin
cans
perhaps
the
most
taking
article
of
merchandise
offered
was
dates
from
the
that
sabas
planted
these
dates
have
no
seeds
there
was
something
appropriate
about
this
childless
monks
seedless
dates
one
could
understand
that
but
these
dates
were
bought
by
the
pilgrims
to
carry
to
their
wives
who
desire
but
have
not
sons
by
what
reasoning
the
monks
have
convinced
them
that
fruitless
dates
will
be
a
cause
of
fruitfulness
i
do
not
know
we
paid
our
tribute
climbed
up
the
stairways
and
out
the
grim
gate
into
the
highway
and
had
a
glorious
ride
in
the
fresh
morning
air
the
way
enlivened
by
blue
sky
bedaween
and
troops
of
returning
pilgrims
and
finally
ennobled
by
the
sight
of
jerusalem
itself
conspicuous
on
its
hill
fair
of
moses
the
armenian
patriarch
the
moslems
believe
that
their
religion
superseded
judaism
and
christianity
closing
the
culminating
series
of
six
great
prophets
adam
noah
abraham
moses
jesus
mohammed
that
they
have
a
right
to
administer
on
the
effects
of
both
they
appropriate
our
sacred
history
and
embellish
it
without
the
least
scruple
assume
exclusive
right
to
our
sacred
places
and
enroll
in
their
own
calendar
all
our
notable
heroes
and
saints
on
the
of
april
was
inaugurated
in
jerusalem
the
fête
and
fair
of
the
prophet
moses
the
fair
is
held
yearly
at
neby
mûsa
a
moslem
wely
in
the
wilderness
of
judæa
some
three
or
four
hours
from
jerusalem
on
a
direct
line
to
the
dead
sea
there
moses
according
to
the
moslem
tradition
was
buried
and
thither
the
faithful
resort
in
great
crowds
at
this
anniversary
and
hold
a
four
days
fair
at
midnight
the
air
was
humming
with
preparations
the
whole
city
buzzed
like
a
hive
about
to
swarm
for
many
days
pilgrims
had
been
gathering
for
this
festival
coming
in
on
all
the
mountain
roads
from
grath
and
askalon
from
hebron
from
nablous
and
jaffa
as
zealous
and
as
ragged
as
those
that
gather
to
the
holy
sepulchre
and
on
the
banks
of
the
jordan
in
the
early
morning
we
heard
the
pounding
of
drums
the
clash
of
cymbals
the
squeaking
of
fifes
and
an
occasional
gun
let
off
as
it
were
by
accident
much
like
the
dawn
of
a
fourth
of
july
at
home
processions
were
straggling
about
the
streets
apparently
lost
like
in
search
of
the
beginning
of
patrick
day
a
disorderly
scramble
of
rags
and
color
a
rabble
hustling
along
without
step
or
order
preceded
usually
by
half
a
dozen
enormous
flags
green
red
yellow
and
blue
embroidered
with
various
devices
and
texts
from
the
koran
which
hung
lifeless
on
their
staves
but
grouped
in
mass
made
as
lively
a
study
of
color
as
a
bevy
of
sails
of
the
chioggia
flocking
into
the
port
of
venice
at
sunrise
before
the
banners
walked
the
musicians
filling
the
narrow
streets
with
a
fearful
uproar
of
rude
drums
and
cymbals
these
people
seem
to
have
inherited
the
musical
talent
of
the
ancient
jews
and
to
have
the
same
passion
for
noise
and
discord
as
the
procession
would
not
move
to
the
tomb
of
moses
until
afternoon
we
devoted
the
morning
to
a
visit
to
the
armenian
patriarch
isaac
archbishop
and
by
the
grace
of
god
patriarch
of
the
armenians
of
jerusalem
occupant
of
the
holy
apostolic
seat
of
james
the
armenian
convent
stands
upon
the
traditional
site
of
the
martyrdom
of
james
claims
to
be
the
spiritual
head
of
five
millions
of
armenians
in
turkey
syria
palestine
india
and
persia
by
firman
from
the
sultan
the
copts
and
the
syrian
and
the
abyssinian
christians
are
in
some
sort
under
his
jurisdiction
but
the
authority
is
merely
nominal
the
of
the
convent
is
a
handsome
hall
for
jerusalem
extending
over
an
archway
of
the
street
below
and
looking
upon
a
garden
the
walls
are
hung
with
engravings
and
lithographs
most
of
them
portraits
of
contemporary
sovereigns
and
princes
of
europe
in
whose
august
company
the
patriarch
seems
to
like
to
sun
himself
we
had
not
to
wait
long
before
he
appeared
and
gave
us
a
courteous
and
simple
welcome
as
soon
as
he
learned
that
we
were
americans
he
said
that
he
had
something
that
he
thought
would
interest
us
and
going
to
his
table
took
out
of
the
drawer
an
old
number
of
an
american
periodical
containing
a
portrait
of
an
american
publisher
which
he
set
great
store
by
we
congratulated
him
upon
his
possession
of
this
treasure
and
expressed
our
passionate
fondness
for
this
sort
of
thing
for
we
soon
discovered
the
delight
the
patriarch
took
in
pictures
and
especially
in
portraits
and
not
least
in
photographs
of
himself
in
the
full
regalia
of
his
sacred
office
and
with
reason
for
he
is
probably
the
handsomest
potentate
in
the
world
he
is
a
tall
finely
proportioned
man
of
fifty
years
and
his
deportment
exhibits
that
happy
courtesy
which
is
born
of
the
love
of
approbation
and
a
kindly
opinion
of
self
he
was
clad
in
the
black
cloak
with
the
pointed
hood
of
the
convent
which
made
a
fine
contrast
to
his
long
full
beard
turning
white
his
complexion
is
fair
white
and
red
and
his
eyes
are
remarkably
pleasant
and
benignant
the
languages
at
the
command
of
the
patriarch
are
two
the
armenian
and
the
turkish
and
we
were
obliged
to
communicate
with
him
through
the
medium
of
the
latter
acting
as
interpreter
how
much
turkish
our
dragoman
knew
and
how
familiar
his
holiness
is
with
it
we
could
not
tell
but
the
conversation
went
on
briskly
as
it
always
does
when
has
control
of
it
when
we
had
exhausted
what
the
patriarch
knew
about
america
and
what
we
knew
about
armenia
which
did
not
take
long
it
was
astonishing
how
few
things
in
all
this
world
of
things
we
knew
in
common
we
directed
the
conversation
upon
what
we
supposed
would
be
congenial
and
common
ground
the
dogma
of
the
trinity
and
the
point
of
difference
between
the
armenian
and
the
latin
church
i
can
not
say
that
we
acquired
much
light
on
the
subject
though
probably
we
did
better
than
disputants
usually
do
on
this
topic
we
had
some
signal
advantages
the
questions
and
answers
strained
through
the
turkish
language
were
robbed
of
all
salient
and
noxious
points
and
solved
themselves
without
difficulty
thus
the
offered
no
subtle
distinctions
to
the
moslem
mind
of
and
he
presented
it
to
the
patriarch
i
have
no
doubt
with
perfect
clarity
at
any
rate
the
reply
was
satisfactory
excellency
he
much
oblige
and
him
say
he
the
elucidation
of
this
point
was
rendered
the
easier
probably
by
the
fact
that
neither
nor
the
patriarch
nor
ourselves
knew
much
about
it
when
i
told
his
highness
if
through
i
did
tell
him
that
the
great
armenian
convent
at
venice
which
holds
with
the
pope
accepts
the
latin
construction
of
the
clause
he
seemed
never
to
have
heard
of
the
great
armenian
convent
at
venice
at
this
point
of
the
conversation
we
thought
it
wise
to
finish
the
subject
by
the
trite
remark
that
we
believed
a
man
life
was
after
all
more
important
than
his
creed
am
i
responded
the
dragoman
and
the
patriarch
seemed
to
be
of
like
mind
a
new
turn
was
given
to
our
interview
by
the
arrival
of
refreshments
a
succession
of
sweetmeats
cordials
candies
and
coffee
the
sweetmeats
first
served
were
a
delicate
preserve
of
plums
this
was
handed
around
in
a
jar
from
which
each
guest
dipped
a
spoonful
and
swallowed
it
drinking
from
a
glass
of
water
immediately
as
we
used
to
take
medicine
in
childhood
the
preserve
was
taken
away
when
each
person
had
tasted
it
and
shortly
a
delicious
orange
cordial
was
brought
and
handed
around
with
candy
coffee
followed
the
patriarch
then
led
the
way
about
his
palace
and
with
some
pride
showed
us
the
gold
and
silver
insignia
of
his
office
and
his
rich
vestments
on
the
wall
of
his
study
hung
a
curious
map
of
the
world
printed
at
amsterdam
in
in
armenian
characters
he
was
so
kind
also
as
to
give
us
his
photograph
enriched
with
his
unreadable
autograph
and
book
printed
at
the
convent
entitled
deux
ans
de
séjour
en
abyssinie
and
we
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
also
the
heroes
and
the
author
of
the
book
armenian
monks
who
undertook
on
an
english
suggestion
a
mission
to
king
theodore
to
intercede
for
the
release
of
the
english
prisoners
held
by
the
tyrant
of
that
land
they
were
detained
by
its
treacherous
and
barbarous
chiefs
robbed
by
people
and
priests
alike
never
reached
the
headquarters
of
the
king
and
were
released
only
after
two
years
of
miserable
captivity
and
suffering
this
book
is
a
faithful
record
of
their
journey
and
contains
a
complete
description
of
the
religion
and
customs
of
the
abyssinians
set
down
with
the
candor
and
verbal
nakedness
of
herodotus
whatever
christianity
the
abyssinians
may
once
have
had
their
religion
now
is
an
odd
mixture
of
judaism
fetichism
and
christian
dogmas
and
their
morals
a
perfect
reproduction
of
those
in
vogue
just
before
the
flood
there
is
no
vice
or
disease
of
barbarism
or
of
civilization
that
is
not
with
them
of
universal
acceptance
and
the
priest
timotheus
the
writer
of
this
narrative
gave
the
abyssinians
abiding
in
jerusalem
a
character
no
better
than
that
of
their
countrymen
at
home
the
patriarch
with
many
expressions
of
civility
gave
us
into
the
charge
of
a
monk
who
showed
us
all
the
parts
of
the
convent
we
had
not
seen
on
a
previous
visit
the
convent
is
not
only
a
wealthy
and
clean
but
also
an
enlightened
establishment
within
its
precincts
are
nuns
as
well
as
monks
and
good
schools
are
maintained
for
children
of
both
sexes
the
with
its
commodious
apartments
was
not
unlike
one
of
our
buildings
for
graded
schools
in
the
rooms
we
saw
many
cases
of
antiquities
and
curiosities
from
various
countries
and
specimens
of
minerals
a
map
which
hung
on
the
wall
and
was
only
one
hundred
years
old
showed
the
red
sea
flowing
into
the
dead
sea
and
the
river
jordan
emptying
into
the
mediterranean
perhaps
the
scholars
learn
ancient
geography
only
at
twelve
the
moslems
said
prayers
in
the
mosque
of
omar
and
at
one
the
procession
was
ready
to
move
out
of
stephen
gate
we
rode
around
to
that
entrance
the
spectacle
spread
before
us
was
marvellous
all
the
gray
and
ragged
slopes
and
ravines
were
gay
with
color
and
lively
with
movement
the
city
walls
on
the
side
overlooking
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
were
covered
with
masses
of
people
clinging
to
them
like
bees
so
the
defences
may
have
appeared
to
titus
when
he
ordered
the
assault
from
the
opposite
hill
the
sunken
road
leading
from
stephen
gate
down
which
the
procession
was
to
pass
was
lined
with
spectators
seated
in
ranks
on
ranks
on
the
stony
slopes
these
were
mostly
women
being
one
of
the
few
days
upon
which
the
moslem
women
may
freely
come
abroad
in
pure
white
and
with
white
veils
drawn
about
their
heads
these
clouds
of
white
robes
were
relieved
here
and
there
by
flaming
spots
of
color
for
the
children
and
slaves
accompanied
the
women
and
their
dress
added
blue
and
red
and
yellow
to
the
picture
men
also
mingled
in
the
throng
displaying
turbans
of
blue
and
black
and
green
and
white
one
could
not
say
that
any
color
or
nationality
was
wanting
in
the
spectacle
sprinkled
in
groups
all
over
the
hillside
in
the
moslem
cemetery
and
beneath
it
were
like
groups
of
color
and
streaks
of
it
marked
the
descent
of
every
winding
path
the
prince
of
oldenburg
the
only
foreign
dignitary
present
had
his
tents
pitched
upon
a
knoll
outside
the
gate
and
other
tents
dotted
the
roadside
and
the
hill
crowds
of
people
thronged
both
sides
of
the
road
to
the
mount
of
olives
and
to
gethsemane
spreading
themselves
in
the
valley
and
extending
away
up
the
road
of
the
triumphal
entry
everywhere
were
the
most
brilliant
effects
of
white
red
yellow
gray
green
black
and
striped
raiment
no
matter
what
these
orientals
put
on
it
becomes
picturesque
old
rags
and
carpets
anything
there
could
not
be
a
finer
place
for
a
display
than
these
two
opposing
hillsides
the
narrow
valley
and
the
winding
roads
which
increased
the
apparent
length
of
the
procession
and
set
it
off
to
the
best
advantage
we
were
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
see
this
ancient
valley
of
bones
revived
in
a
manner
to
recall
the
pageants
and
shows
of
centuries
ago
and
as
we
rode
down
the
sunken
road
in
advance
of
the
procession
we
imagined
how
we
might
have
felt
if
we
had
been
mounted
on
horses
or
elephants
instead
of
donkeys
and
if
we
had
been
conquerors
leading
a
triumph
and
these
people
on
either
hand
had
been
cheering
us
instead
of
jeering
us
turkish
soldiers
stationed
every
thirty
paces
kept
the
road
clear
for
the
expected
cavalcade
in
order
to
see
it
and
the
spectators
to
the
best
advantage
we
took
position
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
and
below
the
road
around
the
mount
of
olives
the
procession
was
a
good
illustration
of
the
shallow
splendor
of
the
orient
it
had
no
order
no
uniformity
no
organization
it
dragged
itself
along
at
the
whim
of
its
separate
squads
first
came
a
guard
of
soldiers
then
a
little
huddle
of
men
of
all
sorts
of
colors
and
apparel
bearing
several
flags
among
them
the
green
flag
of
moses
after
an
interval
another
squad
bearing
large
and
gorgeous
flags
preceded
by
musicians
beating
drums
and
cymbals
in
front
of
the
drums
danced
or
rather
hitched
forward
with
stately
steps
two
shabby
fellows
throwing
their
bodies
from
side
to
side
and
casting
their
arms
about
clashing
cymbals
and
smirking
with
infinite
conceit
at
long
intervals
came
other
like
bands
with
flags
and
music
in
such
disorder
as
scarcely
to
be
told
from
the
spectators
except
that
they
bore
guns
and
pistols
which
they
continually
fired
into
the
air
and
close
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
with
a
reckless
profusion
of
powder
and
the
most
murderous
appearance
to
these
followed
mounted
soldiers
in
white
with
a
turkish
band
of
music
than
any
military
band
in
italy
and
after
this
the
pasha
the
governor
of
the
city
a
number
of
civil
and
military
dignitaries
and
one
or
two
high
ulemas
and
a
representative
of
the
prophet
beggar
on
horseback
fiery
horses
which
curveted
about
in
the
crowd
excited
by
the
guns
the
music
and
the
discharge
of
a
cannon
now
and
then
which
was
stationed
at
the
gate
of
stephen
among
the
insignia
displayed
were
two
tall
instruments
of
brass
which
twirled
and
glittered
in
the
sun
not
like
the
golden
candlestick
of
the
jews
nor
the
of
the
catholics
nor
the
sistrum
of
the
ancient
egyptians
but
perhaps
as
moslemism
is
a
reminiscence
of
all
religions
a
caricature
of
all
three
the
crush
in
the
narrow
road
round
the
hill
and
the
grouping
of
all
the
gorgeous
banners
there
produced
a
momentary
fine
effect
but
generally
save
for
the
spectators
the
display
was
cheap
and
childish
only
once
did
we
see
either
soldiers
or
civilians
marching
in
order
there
were
five
fellows
in
line
carrying
nubian
spears
and
also
five
sappers
and
miners
in
line
wearing
leathern
aprons
and
bearing
theatrical
as
to
the
arms
we
could
discover
no
two
guns
of
the
same
pattern
in
all
the
multitude
of
guns
like
most
things
in
the
east
the
demonstration
was
one
of
show
color
and
noise
not
to
be
examined
too
closely
but
to
be
taken
with
faith
as
we
eat
dates
a
company
of
sheridan
cavalry
would
have
scattered
the
entire
army
the
procession
having
halted
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
countermarched
and
returned
but
the
flag
of
moses
and
its
guard
went
on
to
the
camp
at
his
tomb
there
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
pilgrims
on
the
monday
following
and
the
most
gorgeous
moslem
demonstration
of
the
year
was
over
from
jerusalem
the
day
came
to
leave
jerusalem
circumstances
rendered
it
impossible
for
us
to
make
the
overland
trip
to
damascus
or
even
to
haifa
our
regret
that
we
should
not
see
bethel
shechem
samaria
nazareth
and
the
sea
of
galilee
was
somewhat
lessened
by
the
thought
that
we
knew
the
general
character
of
the
country
and
the
villages
by
what
we
had
already
seen
and
that
experience
had
taught
us
the
inevitable
disenchantment
of
seeing
the
historical
and
the
sacred
places
of
judæa
it
is
not
that
one
visits
a
desert
and
a
heap
of
ruins
would
be
endurable
and
even
stimulating
to
the
imagination
but
every
locality
which
is
dear
to
the
reader
by
some
divine
visitation
or
wonderful
by
some
achievement
of
hero
or
prophet
is
degraded
by
the
presence
of
sordid
habitations
and
a
mixed
vicious
and
unsavory
population
or
incrusted
with
the
most
puerile
superstitions
so
that
the
traveller
is
fain
to
content
himself
with
a
general
view
of
the
unchanged
features
of
the
country
it
must
be
with
a
certain
feeling
of
humiliation
that
at
nazareth
for
instance
the
object
of
his
pilgrimage
is
belittled
to
the
inspection
of
such
inventions
as
the
spot
upon
which
the
virgin
stood
when
she
received
the
annunciation
and
the
in
which
joseph
worked
at
any
rate
we
let
such
thoughts
predominate
when
we
were
obliged
to
relinquish
the
overland
journey
and
whatever
we
missed
i
flatter
myself
that
the
readers
of
these
desultory
sketches
will
lose
nothing
i
should
have
indulged
a
certain
curiosity
in
riding
over
a
country
as
rich
in
memories
as
it
is
poor
in
aspect
but
i
should
have
been
able
to
add
nothing
to
the
minute
descriptions
and
vivid
pictures
with
which
the
christian
world
is
familiar
and
if
the
reader
will
excuse
an
additional
personal
remark
i
have
not
had
the
presumption
to
attempt
a
description
of
palestine
and
syria
which
the
volumes
of
robinson
and
thompson
and
porter
have
abundantly
given
but
only
to
make
a
record
of
limited
travel
and
observation
what
i
most
regretted
was
that
we
could
not
see
the
green
and
fertile
plain
of
esdraelon
the
meadow
of
jezreel
and
the
forests
of
tabor
and
carmel
of
beauty
and
of
verdure
and
which
with
the
plain
of
sharon
might
serve
to
mitigate
the
picture
of
grim
desolation
which
the
tourist
cames
away
from
the
holy
land
finally
it
was
with
a
feeling
akin
to
regret
that
we
looked
our
last
upon
gray
and
melancholy
jerusalem
we
had
grown
a
little
familiar
with
its
few
objects
of
past
or
present
grandeur
the
saracenic
walls
and
towers
the
temple
platform
and
its
resplendent
mosque
the
agglomeration
called
the
church
of
the
holy
sepulchre
the
ruins
of
the
palace
and
hospice
of
the
knights
of
john
the
massive
convents
and
hospices
of
various
nations
and
sects
that
rise
amid
the
indistinguishable
huddle
of
wretched
habitations
threaded
by
filthy
streets
and
noisome
gutters
and
yet
we
confessed
to
the
inevitable
fascination
which
is
always
exercised
upon
the
mind
by
antiquity
the
mysterious
attraction
of
association
the
undefinable
influence
in
decay
and
desolation
which
holds
while
it
repels
the
empire
one
might
say
the
tyranny
over
the
imagination
and
the
will
which
an
ancient
city
asserts
as
if
by
force
of
an
immortal
personality
compelling
first
curiosity
then
endurance
then
sympathy
and
finally
love
jerusalem
has
neither
the
art
the
climate
the
antiquities
nor
the
society
which
draw
the
world
and
hold
it
captive
in
rome
but
its
associations
enable
it
to
exercise
in
a
degree
the
same
attraction
its
attraction
is
in
its
historic
spell
and
name
and
in
spite
of
the
modern
city
jerusalem
in
fact
is
incrusted
with
layer
upon
layer
of
inventions
the
product
of
credulity
cunning
and
superstition
a
monstrous
growth
always
enlarging
so
that
already
the
simple
facts
of
history
are
buried
almost
beyond
recognition
beneath
this
mass
of
rubbish
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
growth
of
christianity
in
the
world
if
jerusalem
had
been
abandoned
had
become
like
carthage
and
memphis
and
tadmor
in
the
wilderness
and
the
modern
pilgrim
were
free
to
choose
his
seat
upon
a
fallen
wall
or
mossy
rock
and
reconstruct
for
himself
the
pageant
of
the
past
and
recall
that
living
presence
undisturbed
by
the
impertinences
which
belittle
the
name
of
religion
it
has
always
been
held
well
that
the
place
of
the
burial
of
moses
was
unknown
it
would
perhaps
have
conduced
to
the
purity
of
the
christian
faith
if
no
attempt
had
ever
been
made
to
break
through
the
obscurity
which
rests
upon
the
place
of
the
sepulchre
of
christ
invention
has
grown
upon
invention
and
we
have
the
jerusalem
of
as
a
result
of
the
exaggerated
importance
attached
to
the
localization
of
the
divine
manifestation
whatever
interest
jerusalem
has
for
the
antiquarian
or
for
the
devout
mind
it
is
undeniable
that
one
must
seek
in
other
lands
and
among
other
peoples
for
the
robust
virtue
the
hatred
of
shams
and
useless
forms
the
sweet
charity
the
invigorating
principles
the
high
thinking
and
the
simple
worship
inculcated
by
the
founder
of
christianity
the
horses
were
ready
jerusalem
had
just
begun
to
stir
an
itinerant
vender
of
coffee
had
set
up
his
tray
on
the
street
and
was
lustily
calling
to
catch
the
attention
of
the
early
workmen
or
the
vagrants
who
pick
themselves
up
from
the
doorsteps
at
dawn
and
begin
to
reconnoitre
for
the
necessary
and
cheap
taste
of
coffee
with
which
the
oriental
day
opens
the
sky
was
overcast
and
a
drop
or
two
of
rain
fell
as
we
were
getting
into
the
saddle
but
is
nothing
said
the
goes
to
be
a
beautiful
and
so
it
proved
scarcely
were
we
outside
the
city
when
it
cleared
superbly
and
we
set
forward
on
our
long
ride
of
miles
to
the
in
high
spirits
we
turned
to
catch
the
first
sunlight
upon
the
gray
tower
of
david
and
then
went
gayly
on
over
the
cool
free
hills
inhaling
the
sparkling
air
and
the
perfume
of
and
exchanging
greetings
with
the
pilgrims
moslem
and
christian
who
must
have
broken
up
their
camps
in
the
hills
at
the
earliest
light
there
are
all
varieties
of
nationality
and
costume
and
many
of
the
peaceful
pilgrims
are
armed
as
if
going
to
a
military
rendezvous
perhaps
our
cavalcade
which
is
also
an
assorted
one
of
horses
donkeys
and
mules
is
as
amusing
as
any
we
meet
i
am
certain
that
the
horse
that
one
of
the
ladies
rides
is
unique
a
mere
framework
of
bones
which
rattle
as
he
agitates
himself
a
rear
view
of
the
animal
and
his
twisting
and
interlacing
legs
when
he
moves
briskly
suggest
a
chinese
puzzle
we
halted
at
the
outlet
of
wady
where
there
is
an
inn
which
has
the
appearance
of
a
den
of
thieves
and
took
our
lunch
upon
some
giant
rocks
under
a
the
fruit
of
which
was
already
half
grown
here
i
discovered
another
black
calla
and
borrowed
a
pick
of
the
landlord
to
endeavor
to
dig
up
its
bulb
but
it
was
impossible
to
extract
it
from
the
rocks
and
when
i
returned
the
tool
the
owner
demanded
pay
for
the
use
of
it
i
told
him
that
if
he
would
come
to
america
i
would
lend
him
a
pick
and
let
him
dig
all
day
in
the
garden
liberality
which
he
was
unable
to
comprehend
by
four
we
were
at
bamleh
and
turned
aside
to
inspect
the
saracen
tower
it
stands
upon
one
side
of
a
large
enclosure
of
walls
and
arches
an
extensive
ruin
under
ground
are
vaulted
constructions
apparently
extending
as
far
as
the
ruins
above
reminding
one
of
the
remains
of
the
hospice
of
john
at
jerusalem
in
its
form
and
treatment
and
feeling
this
noble
tower
is
gothic
and
taking
it
in
connection
with
the
remains
about
it
i
should
have
said
it
was
of
christian
construction
in
spite
of
the
arabic
inscription
over
one
of
the
doorways
which
might
have
been
added
when
the
saracens
took
possession
of
it
but
i
believe
that
antiquarians
have
decided
that
the
tower
was
erected
by
moslems
these
are
the
most
ruins
we
had
seen
in
the
east
they
are
and
like
the
remains
of
an
english
abbey
and
stand
in
the
midst
of
a
green
and
most
lovely
country
no
sand
no
nakedness
no
beggars
grass
fills
all
the
enclosure
and
press
close
about
it
no
view
could
be
more
enchanting
than
that
of
the
tower
and
the
rolling
plain
at
that
hour
the
bloom
on
the
flecked
with
flaming
poppies
the
silver
of
the
olive
groves
the
beds
of
scarlet
anemones
and
yellow
buttercups
blotching
the
meadows
with
brilliant
colors
like
a
picture
of
turner
the
soft
gray
hills
of
judæa
the
steeples
and
minarets
of
the
city
all
ramleh
is
built
on
and
amid
ruins
arches
and
vaults
twilight
came
upon
us
while
we
were
yet
in
the
interminable
plain
but
jaffa
announced
itself
by
its
long
before
we
entered
its
straggling
suburbs
indeed
when
we
were
three
miles
away
the
odor
of
its
gardens
weighted
by
the
was
too
heavy
to
be
agreeable
at
a
distance
this
odor
was
more
perceptible
than
in
the
town
itself
but
next
day
in
the
full
heat
of
the
sun
we
found
it
so
overpowering
as
to
give
a
tendency
to
headache
the
syrian
coast
our
only
business
in
jaffa
being
to
get
away
from
it
we
impatiently
expected
the
arrival
of
the
austrian
lloyd
steamer
for
beyrout
the
venus
a
fickle
and
unsteady
craft
as
its
name
implies
in
the
afternoon
we
got
on
board
taking
note
as
we
left
the
land
of
the
great
stones
that
jut
out
into
the
sea
the
chains
with
which
andromeda
was
bound
have
left
their
footsteps
which
attest
says
josephus
the
antiquity
of
that
the
venus
which
should
have
departed
at
three
lay
rolling
about
amid
the
tossing
and
bobbing
and
crushing
crowd
of
boats
and
barges
till
late
in
the
evening
taking
in
boxes
of
oranges
and
bags
of
barley
by
the
slow
process
of
hoisting
up
one
or
two
at
a
time
the
ship
was
lightly
loaded
with
freight
but
overrun
with
passengers
returning
pilgrims
from
mecca
and
from
jerusalem
whom
the
waters
of
the
jordan
seemed
not
to
have
benefited
who
invaded
every
part
of
deck
cabin
and
hold
and
spreading
their
beds
under
the
windows
of
the
cabins
of
the
passengers
reduced
the
whole
company
to
a
common
disgust
the
light
load
caused
the
vessel
to
roll
a
little
and
there
was
nothing
agreeable
in
the
situation
the
next
morning
we
were
in
the
harbor
of
haifa
under
the
shadow
of
mt
carmel
and
rose
early
to
read
about
elijah
and
to
bring
as
near
to
us
as
we
could
with
an
the
convent
and
the
scene
of
victory
over
the
priests
of
baal
the
noble
convent
we
saw
and
the
brow
of
carmel
which
the
prophet
ascended
to
pray
for
rain
but
the
place
of
the
miraculous
sacrifice
is
on
the
other
side
in
view
of
the
plain
of
esdraelon
and
so
is
the
plain
by
the
river
kishon
where
elijah
slew
the
four
hundred
and
fifty
prophets
of
baal
whom
he
had
already
mocked
and
defeated
the
grotto
of
elijah
is
shown
in
the
hill
and
the
monks
who
inhabit
the
convent
regard
themselves
as
the
successors
of
an
unbroken
succession
of
holy
occupants
since
the
days
of
the
great
prophet
their
sumptuous
quarters
would
no
doubt
excite
the
indignation
of
elijah
and
elisha
who
would
not
properly
discriminate
between
the
modern
reign
of
mammon
and
the
ancient
rule
of
baal
haifa
itself
is
only
a
huddle
of
houses
on
the
beach
ten
miles
across
the
curving
bay
we
saw
the
battlements
of
akka
on
its
triangle
of
land
jutting
into
the
sea
above
the
mouth
of
kishon
out
of
the
fertile
and
plain
we
see
it
more
distinctly
as
we
pass
and
if
we
were
to
land
we
should
see
little
more
for
few
fragments
remain
to
attest
its
many
masters
and
strange
vicissitudes
a
prosperous
seat
of
the
phoenicians
it
offered
hospitality
to
the
tribe
of
asher
it
was
a
greek
city
of
wealth
and
consequence
it
was
considered
the
key
of
palestine
during
the
crusades
and
the
headquarters
of
the
templars
and
the
knights
of
john
and
in
more
modern
times
it
had
the
credit
of
giving
the
checkmate
to
the
feeble
imitation
of
alexander
in
the
east
attempted
by
napoleon
i
the
day
was
cloudy
and
a
little
cool
and
not
unpleasant
but
there
existed
all
day
a
which
is
full
of
all
nastiness
and
a
short
sea
which
aggravated
the
and
although
we
sailed
by
the
lebanon
mountains
and
along
an
historic
coast
bristling
with
suggestions
and
with
little
but
suggestions
of
an
heroic
past
by
akka
and
tyre
and
sidon
we
were
mostly
indifferent
to
it
all
the
mediterranean
on
occasion
takes
away
one
appetite
even
for
ruins
and
ancient
history
we
can
distinguish
as
we
sail
by
it
the
mean
modern
town
which
wears
still
the
royal
purple
name
of
tyre
and
the
peninsula
formerly
the
island
upon
which
the
old
town
stood
and
which
gave
it
its
name
the
arabs
still
call
it
tsur
or
sur
rock
and
the
ancients
fancied
that
this
island
of
rock
had
the
form
of
a
ship
and
was
typical
of
the
maritime
pursuits
of
its
people
some
have
thought
it
more
like
the
cradle
of
commerce
which
tyre
is
sometimes
though
erroneously
said
to
be
for
she
was
only
the
daughter
of
sidon
and
did
but
inherit
from
her
mother
the
secret
of
the
mastery
of
the
seas
there
were
two
cities
of
tyre
one
on
the
island
and
another
on
the
shore
tyre
is
not
an
old
city
in
the
eastern
reckoning
the
date
of
its
foundation
as
a
great
power
only
rising
to
about
about
the
time
of
the
trojan
war
and
after
the
fall
of
sidon
although
there
was
a
city
there
a
couple
of
centuries
earlier
when
joshua
and
his
followers
conquered
the
of
palestine
it
could
never
in
its
days
of
greatness
have
been
large
probably
containing
not
more
than
to
inhabitants
but
its
reputation
was
disproportionate
to
its
magnitude
joshua
calls
it
the
city
tyre
and
it
had
the
entire
respect
of
jerusalem
in
the
most
haughty
days
of
the
latter
tyre
seems
to
have
been
included
in
the
allotted
to
asher
but
that
luxurious
son
of
jacob
yielded
to
the
phoenicians
and
not
they
to
him
indeed
the
parcelling
of
territory
to
the
israelitish
tribes
on
condition
that
they
would
conquer
it
recalls
the
liberal
dying
bequest
made
by
a
tender
virginian
to
his
son
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
if
he
could
make
it
the
portion
of
the
canaanites
or
the
phoenicians
was
never
subdued
by
the
jews
it
preserved
a
fortunate
independence
in
order
that
under
the
providence
that
protected
the
phoenicians
after
having
given
the
world
and
the
first
impulse
of
all
the
permanent
civilization
that
written
language
implies
they
could
still
bless
it
by
teaching
it
commerce
and
that
wide
exchange
of
products
which
is
a
practical
brotherhood
of
man
the
world
was
spared
the
calamity
of
the
descent
of
the
tribes
of
israel
upon
the
phoenician
cities
of
the
coast
and
art
was
permitted
to
grow
with
industry
unfortunately
the
tribes
who
formed
the
kingdom
of
israel
were
capable
of
imitating
only
the
idolatrous
worship
and
the
sensuality
of
their
more
polished
neighbors
such
an
ascendency
did
tyre
obtain
in
jewish
affairs
through
the
princess
jezebel
and
the
reception
of
the
priests
of
baal
that
for
many
years
both
samaria
and
jerusalem
might
almost
be
called
dependencies
of
the
city
of
the
god
lord
melkarth
baal
of
the
arts
of
the
phoenicians
the
jews
were
not
apt
to
learn
the
beautiful
of
their
temples
was
executed
by
tyrians
and
their
curious
work
in
wood
also
the
secret
of
the
famous
purple
dye
of
the
royal
stuffs
which
the
jews
coveted
was
known
only
to
the
tyrians
who
extracted
from
a
this
dark
red
violet
when
the
jews
built
tyrian
workmen
were
necessary
when
solomon
undertook
his
commercial
ventures
into
the
far
orient
it
was
tyrians
who
built
his
ships
at
and
it
was
tyrian
sailors
who
manned
them
the
phoenicians
carried
the
manufacture
of
glass
to
a
perfection
unknown
to
the
ancient
egyptians
producing
that
beautiful
ware
the
art
of
which
was
revived
by
the
venetians
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
jews
did
not
learn
from
the
phoenicians
but
the
greeks
did
how
to
make
that
graceful
pottery
and
to
paint
the
vases
which
are
the
despair
of
modern
imitators
the
tyrian
mariners
following
the
sidonian
supplied
the
mediterranean
countries
including
egypt
with
tin
for
the
manufacture
of
bronze
by
adventurous
voyages
as
far
as
britain
and
no
people
ever
excelled
them
in
the
working
of
bronze
as
none
in
their
time
equalled
them
in
the
carving
of
ivory
the
engraving
of
precious
metals
and
the
cutting
and
setting
of
jewels
unfortunately
scarcely
anything
remains
of
the
abundant
literature
of
the
phoenicians
the
canaanites
were
a
literary
people
before
the
invasion
of
joshua
their
language
was
semitic
and
almost
identical
with
the
hebrew
although
they
were
descendants
of
ham
not
only
their
light
literature
but
their
historical
records
have
disappeared
and
we
have
small
knowledge
of
their
kings
or
their
great
men
the
one
we
are
most
familiar
with
is
the
shrewd
and
liberal
hiram
i
can
not
tell
why
he
always
reminds
me
of
general
grant
who
exchanged
riddles
with
solomon
and
shared
with
the
mountain
king
the
profits
of
his
maritime
skill
and
experience
hiram
tomb
is
still
pointed
out
to
the
curious
at
tyre
and
the
mutations
of
religions
and
the
freaks
of
fortune
are
illustrated
by
the
chance
that
has
grouped
so
closely
together
the
graves
of
hiram
of
frederick
barbarossa
and
of
origen
late
in
the
afternoon
we
came
in
sight
of
sidon
that
ancient
city
which
the
infers
was
famous
at
the
time
of
the
appearance
of
joshua
since
that
skilful
captain
speaks
of
it
as
famous
it
doubtless
had
been
long
before
his
arrival
but
the
epithet
merely
distinguished
the
two
cities
for
sidon
was
divided
like
tyre
being
on
the
shore
and
at
some
distance
inland
tradition
says
it
was
built
by
sidon
the
of
noah
but
however
this
may
be
it
is
doubtless
the
oldest
phoenician
city
except
gebel
which
is
on
the
coast
north
of
beyrout
it
is
now
for
the
antiquarian
little
more
than
a
necropolis
and
a
heap
of
stones
on
which
fishermen
dry
their
nets
although
some
nine
to
ten
thousand
people
occupy
its
squalid
houses
what
we
see
of
it
is
the
ridge
of
rocks
forming
the
shallow
harbor
and
the
picturesque
arched
bridge
with
which
engravings
have
made
us
familiar
that
connects
a
ruined
fortress
on
a
detached
rock
with
the
rocky
peninsula
sidon
cames
us
far
back
into
antiquity
when
the
canaanitish
tribes
migrated
from
their
seat
on
the
persian
gulf
a
part
of
them
continued
their
march
as
far
as
egypt
it
seems
to
be
settled
that
the
hittites
or
khitas
were
the
invaders
who
overran
the
land
of
the
pharaohs
sweeping
away
in
their
barbarous
violence
nearly
all
the
monuments
of
the
civilization
of
preceding
eras
and
placing
upon
the
throne
of
that
old
empire
the
race
of
shepherd
kings
it
was
doubtless
during
the
dynasty
of
the
shepherds
that
abraham
visited
egypt
and
it
was
a
pharaoh
of
hittite
origin
who
made
joseph
his
minister
it
was
after
the
expulsion
of
the
shepherds
and
the
establishment
of
a
dynasty
knew
not
that
the
israelites
were
oppressed
but
the
canaanites
did
not
all
pass
beyond
syria
and
palestine
some
among
them
who
afterwards
were
distinctively
known
as
phoenicians
established
a
maritime
kingdom
and
founded
among
other
cities
that
of
sidon
this
maritime
branch
no
doubt
kept
up
an
intercourse
with
the
other
portions
of
the
canaanite
family
in
southern
syria
and
in
egypt
before
the
one
was
driven
out
of
egypt
by
the
revolution
which
restored
the
rule
of
the
egyptian
pharaohs
and
the
other
expelled
by
the
advent
of
the
philistines
and
it
seems
altogether
probable
that
the
phoenicians
received
from
egypt
many
arts
which
they
afterwards
improved
and
perfected
it
is
tolerably
certain
that
they
borrowed
from
egypt
the
hieratic
writing
or
some
of
its
characters
which
taught
them
to
represent
the
sounds
of
their
language
by
the
alphabet
which
they
gave
to
the
world
the
sidonians
were
subjugated
by
thotmes
with
all
phoenicia
and
were
for
centuries
the
useful
allies
of
the
egyptians
but
their
dominion
was
over
the
sea
and
they
spread
their
colonies
first
to
the
grecian
isles
and
then
along
the
african
coast
and
in
the
other
direction
sent
their
venturesome
barks
as
far
as
colchis
on
the
black
sea
they
seem
to
have
thrived
most
under
the
egyptian
supremacy
for
the
pharaohs
had
need
of
their
sailors
and
their
ships
in
the
later
days
of
the
empire
in
the
reign
of
necho
it
was
phoenician
sailors
who
at
his
command
circumnavigated
africa
passing
down
the
red
sea
and
returning
through
the
pillars
of
hercules
the
few
remains
of
sidon
which
we
see
are
only
a
few
centuries
old
or
seven
there
are
no
monuments
to
carry
us
back
to
the
city
famous
in
arts
and
arms
of
which
homer
sang
and
if
there
were
the
antiquity
of
this
hoary
coast
would
still
elude
us
herodotus
says
that
the
temple
of
melkarth
at
tyre
the
of
was
built
about
probably
he
errs
by
a
couple
of
centuries
for
it
was
only
something
like
centuries
before
christ
that
the
canaanites
came
into
palestine
that
is
to
say
late
in
the
thirteenth
egyptian
dynasty
dynasty
which
according
to
the
list
of
manetho
and
mariette
bey
is
separated
from
the
reign
of
the
first
egyptian
king
by
an
interval
of
centuries
when
abraham
wandered
from
mesopotamia
into
palestine
he
found
the
canaanites
in
possession
but
they
were
comparatively
new
comers
they
had
found
the
land
already
occupied
by
a
numerous
population
who
were
so
far
advanced
in
civilization
as
to
have
built
many
cities
among
the
peoples
holding
the
land
before
them
were
the
rephaim
who
had
sixty
strong
towns
in
what
is
now
the
wilderness
of
bashan
there
were
also
the
emim
the
zamzummim
and
the
anakim
primitive
races
and
perhaps
conquerors
of
a
people
farther
back
in
the
twilight
remnants
of
whom
still
remained
in
palestine
when
the
jews
began
in
their
turn
to
level
its
cities
to
the
earth
and
who
lived
in
the
jewish
traditions
as
the
lebanon
all
the
afternoon
we
had
the
noble
range
of
mt
lebanon
in
view
and
towards
five
we
saw
the
promontory
upon
which
beyrout
stands
this
bold
headland
however
changed
its
appearance
when
we
had
rounded
it
and
came
into
the
harbor
instead
of
sloping
sand
we
had
a
rocky
coast
and
rising
from
the
bay
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
beyrout
first
the
shabby
old
city
and
then
the
new
portion
higher
up
with
its
villas
embowered
in
trees
to
the
right
upon
the
cliffs
overlooking
the
sea
is
the
american
college
an
institution
whose
conspicuous
position
is
only
a
fair
indication
of
its
importance
in
the
east
and
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
it
does
not
make
a
better
architectural
show
behind
beyrout
in
a
vast
circular
sweep
rise
the
lebanon
mountains
clothed
with
trees
and
vineyards
terraced
and
studded
with
villas
and
villages
the
view
is
scarcely
surpassed
anywhere
for
luxuriance
and
variety
it
seems
to
us
that
if
we
had
an
impulse
to
go
on
a
mission
anywhere
it
would
be
to
the
wicked
of
this
fertile
land
at
beyrout
also
passengers
must
land
in
small
boats
we
were
at
once
boarded
by
the
most
ruffianly
gang
of
boatmen
we
had
yet
seen
who
poured
through
the
gangways
and
climbed
over
the
sides
of
the
vessel
like
privileged
pirates
treading
down
people
in
their
way
it
was
only
after
a
severe
struggle
that
we
reached
our
boats
and
landed
at
the
and
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
legalized
plunderers
who
made
an
attack
upon
our
baggage
and
demanded
our
passports
simply
to
obtain
backsheesh
for
themselves
to
show
passport

by
one
of
those
swarms
which
are
the
nuisance
of
independent
travellers
known
as
a

excellent
people
individually
no
doubt
but
monopolizing
hotels
and
steamboats
and
driving
everybody
else
into
obscurity
by
reason
of
their
numbers
and
compact
organization
we
passed
yesterday
one
of
the
places
on
the
coast
where
jonah
is
said
to
have
left
the
whale
it
is
without
any
contemporary
he
was
in
a
cook
party
of
his
day
and
left
it
in
disgust
for
this
private
conveyance
our
first
care
in
beyrout
was
to
secure
our
passage
to
damascus
there
is
a
over
the
lebanons
constructed
owned
and
managed
by
a
french
company
it
is
the
only
road
in
syria
practicable
for
wheels
but
it
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
world
i
suppose
we
shall
celebrate
our
second
centennial
before
we
have
one
to
compare
with
it
in
the
united
states
the
company
has
the
monopoly
of
all
the
traffic
over
it
forwarding
freight
in
its
endless
trains
of
wagons
and
despatching
a
diligence
each
way
daily
and
a
night
mail
we
went
to
the
office
to
secure
seats
in
the
diligence
are
all
taken
said
the
official
we
would
like
seats
for
the
day
after
are
taken
and
for
the
day
after
a
we
must
go
in
a
private
present
we
have
none
the
two
belonging
to
the
company
are
at
we
will
hire
one
in
the
is
not
permitted
no
private
carriage
is
allowed
to
go
over
the
road
farther
than
five
kilometres
outside
of
you
will
neither
take
us
yourselves
nor
let
any
one
else
when
the
carriage
comes
from
damascus
you
shall
have
the
first
fortunately
one
of
the
carriages
arrived
that
night
and
the
next
morning
at
nine
we
were
en
route
the
diligence
left
at
and
makes
the
trip
in
thirteen
hours
we
were
to
break
the
journey
at
stoura
and
diverge
to
the
carriage
was
a
short
omnibus
with
seats
inside
for
four
a
broad
seat
in
front
and
a
deck
for
the
baggage
painted
a
royal
yellow
three
horses
were
harnessed
to
it
abreast
in
the
shafts
and
one
on
each
side
as
the
horses
were
to
be
changed
at
short
stages
we
went
forward
at
a
swinging
pace
rattling
out
of
the
city
and
commanding
as
much
respect
as
if
we
had
been
the
diligence
itself
with
its
six
horses
three
abreast
and
all
its
haughty
passengers
we
leave
the
promontory
of
beyrout
dip
into
a
long
depression
and
then
begin
to
ascend
the
lebanon
the
road
is
hard
smooth
white
the
soil
on
either
side
is
red
the
country
is
exceedingly
rich
we
pass
villas
extensive
plantations
of
figs
and
great
forests
of
the
mulberry
for
the
silk
culture
is
the
chief
industry
and
small
factories
of
the
famous
syrian
silks
are
scattered
here
and
there
as
the
road
winds
upward
we
find
the
hillsides
are
terraced
and
luxuriant
with
and
grapevines
latter
flourishing
in
fact
to
the
very
top
of
the
mountains
say
feet
above
the
blue
mediterranean
which
sparkles
below
us
into
these
hills
the
people
of
beyrout
come
to
pass
the
heated
months
of
summer
living
in
little
villas
which
are
embowered
in
foliage
all
along
these
lovely
slopes
we
encounter
a
new
sort
of
house
it
is
one
story
high
built
of
limestone
in
square
blocks
and
without
mortar
having
a
flat
roof
covered
with
stones
and
soil
very
primitive
construction
but
universal
here
sometimes
the
building
is
in
two
parts
like
a
double
but
the
opening
between
the
two
is
always
arched
so
much
for
art
but
otherwise
the
house
without
windows
or
with
slits
only
looks
like
a
section
of
as
we
rise
we
begin
to
get
glimpses
of
the
snowy
peaks
which
make
a
sharp
contrast
with
the
ravishing
view
behind
us
terraced
gorges
the
profound
ravines
the
vineyards
gardens
and
orchards
the
blue
sea
and
the
white
road
winding
back
through
all
like
a
ribbon
as
we
look
down
the
limestone
walls
of
the
terraces
are
concealed
and
all
the
white
cliffs
are
hidden
by
the
ample
verdure
entering
farther
into
the
mountains
and
ascending
through
the
grim
wady
hammâna
we
have
the
considerable
village
of
that
name
below
us
on
the
left
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
vast
and
mountain
basin
like
a
gray
heap
of
cinders
on
the
edge
of
a
crater
broken
away
at
one
side
we
look
at
it
with
interest
for
there
lamartine
once
lived
for
some
months
in
as
sentimental
a
seclusion
as
one
could
wish
a
little
higher
up
we
come
to
snow
great
drifts
of
it
by
the
roadside
phenomenon
entirely
beyond
the
comprehension
of
abdallah
who
has
never
seen
sand
so
cold
as
this
which
nevertheless
melts
in
his
hands
after
encountering
the
snow
we
drive
into
a
cold
cloud
which
seems
much
of
the
time
to
hang
on
the
top
of
lebanon
and
have
a
touch
of
real
winter
disagreeable
experience
which
we
had
hoped
to
eliminate
from
this
year
snow
is
only
tolerable
when
seen
at
a
great
distance
as
the
background
in
a
summer
landscape
near
at
hand
it
congeals
the
human
spirits
when
we
were
over
the
summit
and
had
emerged
from
the
thick
cloud
suddenly
a
surprise
greeted
us
opposite
was
the
range
of
two
thousand
feet
below
us
the
broad
plain
which
had
not
now
the
appearance
of
land
but
of
some
painted
scene
singularity
which
is
partially
explained
by
the
red
color
of
the
soil
but
altogether
it
presented
the
most
bewildering
mass
of
color
if
the
valley
had
been
strewn
with
watered
silts
over
a
carpet
of
persian
rugs
the
effect
might
have
been
the
same
there
were
patches
and
strips
of
green
and
of
brown
dashes
of
red
blotches
of
and
sienna
alternations
of
ploughed
field
and
young
grain
and
the
whole
under
the
passing
clouds
took
the
sheen
of
the
opal
the
hard
shining
road
lay
down
the
in
long
loops
in
in
curves
ever
graceful
like
a
long
piece
of
white
tape
flung
by
chance
from
the
summit
to
the
valley
we
dashed
down
it
at
a
great
speed
winding
backwards
and
forwards
on
the
and
continually
shifting
our
point
of
view
of
the
glowing
picture
at
the
little
of
stoura
we
left
the
damascus
road
and
struck
north
for
an
hour
towards
over
a
tolerable
but
the
road
ceased
at
beyond
that
a
horseback
journey
of
six
or
seven
hours
there
is
a
to
stoned
a
part
of
the
way
and
intended
to
be
passable
some
day
lies
on
the
plain
at
the
opening
of
the
wild
gorge
of
the
berduny
a
lively
torrent
which
dances
down
to
join
the
litany
through
the
verdure
of
and
slender
poplars
over
a
mile
up
the
glen
in
the
bosom
of
the
mountains
is
the
town
of
zahleh
the
largest
in
the
lebanon
and
there
we
purposed
to
pass
the
night
having
been
commended
to
the
hospitality
of
the
missionaries
there
by
jessup
of
beyrout
our
halted
establishment
drew
a
crowd
of
curious
spectators
about
it
mostly
women
and
children
who
had
probably
never
seen
a
carriage
before
they
examined
us
and
commented
upon
us
with
perfect
freedom
but
that
was
the
extent
of
their
hospitality
not
one
of
them
was
willing
to
earn
a
para
by
carrying
our
baggage
to
zahleh
and
we
started
up
the
hill
leaving
the
dragoman
in
an
animated
quarrel
with
the
entire
population
who
in
turn
resented
his
comments
upon
their
want
of
religion
and
good
manners
climbing
up
a
stony
hill
threading
gullies
and
ravines
and
finally
rough
streets
we
came
into
the
amphitheatre
in
the
hills
which
enclose
zahleh
the
town
is
unique
in
its
construction
imagine
innumerable
small
whitewashed
wooden
houses
rising
in
concentric
circles
one
above
the
other
on
the
slopes
of
the
basin
like
the
chairs
on
the
terraces
of
a
roman
circus
the
town
is
mostly
new
for
the
druses
captured
it
and
burned
it
in
and
reminds
one
of
a
new
england
factory
village
its
situation
is
a
stony
ragged
basin
three
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
the
tops
of
the
hills
behind
it
were
still
covered
with
snow
and
we
could
easily
fancy
that
we
were
in
switzerland
the
ten
or
twelve
thousand
inhabitants
are
nearly
all
maroyites
a
sect
of
christians
whom
we
should
call
greeks
but
who
are
in
communion
with
the
latin
church
a
people
ignorant
and
superstitious
governed
by
their
priests
occasionally
turbulent
and
always
on
the
point
of
open
rupture
with
the
mysterious
and
subtle
druses
having
the
name
of
christians
and
few
of
the
qualities
they
are
most
unpromising
subjects
of
missionary
labor
yet
the
mission
here
makes
progress
and
converts
and
we
were
glad
to
see
that
the
american
missionaries
were
universally
respected
fortunately
the
american
name
and
christianity
are
exceedingly
well
represented
in
northern
syria
by
gentlemen
who
unite
a
thorough
and
varied
scholarship
with
christian
simplicity
energy
and
enthusiasm
at
first
it
seems
hard
that
so
much
talent
and
culture
should
be
hidden
away
in
such
a
place
as
zahleh
and
we
were
inclined
to
lament
a
lot
so
far
removed
from
the
living
sympathies
of
the
world
it
seems
indeed
almost
hopeless
to
make
any
impression
in
this
antique
and
conceited
mass
of
superstition
but
if
syria
is
to
be
regenerated
and
to
be
ever
the
home
of
an
industrious
clean
and
moral
people
in
sympathy
with
the
enlightened
world
the
change
is
to
be
made
by
exhibiting
to
the
people
a
higher
type
of
christianity
than
they
have
known
hitherto
christianity
that
reforms
manners
and
betters
the
social
condition
and
adds
a
new
interest
to
life
by
lifting
it
to
a
higher
plane
physical
conditions
must
visibly
improve
under
it
it
is
not
enough
in
a
village
like
this
of
zahleh
for
instance
to
set
up
a
new
form
of
christian
worship
and
let
it
drone
on
in
a
sleepy
fashion
however
devout
and
circumspect
it
needs
men
of
talent
scientific
attainment
practical
sagacity
who
shall
make
the
christian
name
respected
by
superior
qualities
as
well
as
by
devout
lives
they
must
show
a
better
style
of
living
more
thrift
and
comfort
than
that
which
prevails
here
the
people
will
by
and
by
see
a
logical
connection
between
a
house
and
garden
a
farm
scientifically
cultivated
a
prosperous
factory
and
the
profitableness
of
honesty
and
industry
with
the
superior
civilization
of
our
western
christianity
you
can
already
see
the
influence
in
syria
of
the
accomplished
scholars
skilful
physicians
and
surgeons
men
versed
in
the
sciences
in
botany
and
geology
who
are
able
to
understand
the
resources
of
the
country
who
are
supported
there
but
not
liberally
enough
supported
by
the
christians
of
america
we
were
entertained
at
the
house
of
the
rev
wood
who
accompanied
us
the
next
day
to
his
mission
territory
including
that
ancient
seat
of
splendid
paganism
some
sort
of
religious
fête
in
the
neighborhood
had
absorbed
the
best
and
we
were
indifferently
mounted
on
the
refuse
of
donkeys
and
horses
abdallah
our
most
shining
possession
riding
as
usual
on
the
top
of
a
pile
of
baggage
the
inhabitants
were
very
civil
as
we
passed
along
we
did
not
know
whether
to
attribute
it
to
the
influence
of
the
missionaries
or
to
the
rarity
of
travellers
but
the
word
we
heard
not
once
in
zahleh
after
we
had
emerged
from
upon
the
open
plain
we
passed
on
our
left
hand
the
moslem
village
of
kerah
nun
which
is
distinguished
as
the
of
the
prophet
noah
but
we
contented
ourselves
with
a
sight
of
the
dome
the
mariner
lies
there
in
a
grave
seventy
feet
long
or
seventy
yards
some
scoffers
say
but
this
whatever
it
is
is
not
the
measure
of
the
patriarch
the
grave
proved
too
short
and
noah
is
buried
with
his
knees
bent
and
his
feet
extending
downward
in
the
ground
the
plain
of
bukâ
is
some
ninety
miles
long
and
in
this
portion
of
it
about
ten
miles
broad
it
is
well
watered
and
though
the
red
soil
is
stuffed
with
small
stones
it
is
very
fertile
and
would
yield
abundantly
if
cultivated
but
it
is
mostly
an
abandoned
waste
of
weeds
the
ground
rises
gradually
all
the
way
to
starting
from
an
elevation
of
three
thousand
feet
the
plain
is
rolling
and
the
streams
which
rush
down
from
the
near
mountains
are
very
swift
nothing
could
be
lovelier
than
the
snowy
ranges
of
mountains
on
either
hand
in
contrast
with
the
browns
and
reds
of
the
slopes
our
own
autumn
foliage
the
green
and
brown
plain
now
sprinkled
with
of
many
varieties
the
sky
was
covered
with
clouds
great
masses
floating
about
the
wind
from
the
hills
was
cold
and
at
length
drove
us
to
our
wraps
then
a
fine
rain
ensued
but
it
did
not
last
long
for
the
rainy
season
was
over
we
crossed
the
plain
diagonally
and
lunched
at
a
little
khan
half
house
and
half
stable
raised
above
a
stream
with
a
group
of
young
poplars
in
front
we
sat
on
a
raised
divan
in
the
covered
court
and
looked
out
through
the
arched
doorway
over
a
lovely
expanse
of
plain
and
hills
it
was
difficult
to
tell
which
part
of
the
house
was
devoted
to
the
stable
and
which
to
the
family
from
the
door
of
the
room
which
i
selected
as
the
neatest
came
the
braying
of
a
donkey
the
landlord
and
his
wife
a
young
woman
and
rather
pretty
who
had
a
baby
in
her
arms
furnished
pipes
and
tobacco
and
the
travellers
or
are
on
the
ground
smoking
narghilelis
a
squad
of
ruffianly
metâwileh
a
sect
of
moslems
who
follow
the
koran
strictly
and
reject
the
traditions
like
those
who
call
themselves
bible
christians
in
distinction
from
theological
christians
from
the
field
deposited
their
ploughs
which
they
carried
on
their
shoulders
on
the
platform
outside
and
seating
themselves
in
a
row
in
the
khan
looked
at
us
stolidly
and
we
having
the
opportunity
of
saying
so
looked
at
them
intelligently
we
went
on
obliquely
across
the
plain
rising
a
little
through
a
region
rich
but
only
half
cultivated
crossing
streams
and
floundering
in
for
three
hours
on
a
walk
the
wind
growing
stronger
from
the
snow
mountains
and
the
cold
becoming
almost
unendurable
it
was
in
vain
that
spun
hour
after
hour
an
arab
romance
not
even
the
warm
colors
of
the
oriental
imagination
could
soften
the
piteous
blast
at
length
when
patience
was
nearly
gone
in
a
depression
in
the
plain
close
to
the
of
behold
the
great
that
is
to
say
a
moslem
village
of
three
thousand
to
four
thousand
inhabitants
fairly
clean
and
sightly
and
the
ruins
just
on
the
edge
of
it
the
six
gigantic
corinthian
pillars
standing
out
against
the
gray
sky
never
was
sight
more
welcome
like
zahleh
has
no
inn
and
we
lodged
in
a
private
house
near
the
ruins
the
house
was
one
story
it
consisted
of
four
large
rooms
in
a
row
looking
upon
the
enclosure
each
with
its
door
and
with
no
communication
between
them
the
kitchen
was
in
a
separate
building
these
rooms
had
high
ceilings
of
beams
supporting
the
flat
roof
windows
with
shutters
but
without
glass
divans
along
one
side
and
in
one
corner
a
fireplace
and
chimney
each
room
had
a
niche
extending
from
the
floor
almost
to
the
ceiling
in
which
the
beds
are
piled
in
the
daytime
at
night
they
are
made
up
on
the
divans
or
on
the
floor
this
is
the
common
pattern
of
a
syrian
house
and
when
we
got
a
fire
blazing
in
the
big
and
began
to
thaw
out
our
stiff
limbs
and
brought
in
something
from
the
kitchen
that
was
hot
and
red
in
color
and
may
have
had
spice
on
the
top
of
it
we
found
this
the
most
comfortable
residence
in
the
world
it
is
the
business
of
a
dragoman
to
produce
the
improbable
in
impossible
places
rubbed
his
lamp
and
converted
this
establishment
into
a
tolerable
inn
with
a
prolific
kitchen
and
an
abundant
table
while
he
was
performing
this
revolution
we
went
to
see
the
ruins
the
most
noble
portions
of
which
have
survived
the
religion
and
almost
the
memory
of
the
builders
the
remains
of
the
temples
of
or
hieropolis
are
only
elevated
as
they
stand
upon
an
artificial
platform
they
are
in
the
depression
of
the
valley
and
in
fact
a
considerable
stream
flows
all
about
the
walls
and
penetrates
the
subterranean
passages
this
water
comes
from
a
fountain
which
bursts
out
of
the
hills
about
half
a
mile
above
in
an
immense
volume
falls
into
a
great
basin
and
flows
away
in
a
small
river
these
instantaneously
born
rivers
are
a
peculiarity
of
syria
and
they
often
disappear
as
suddenly
as
they
come
the
water
of
this
fountain
is
cold
pure
and
sweet
it
deserves
to
be
called
a
and
is
so
far
as
my
experience
goes
the
most
agreeable
water
in
the
world
the
moslems
have
a
proverb
which
expresses
its
unique
worth
water
of
never
leaves
its
it
rushes
past
the
village
almost
a
river
in
size
and
then
disappears
in
the
plain
below
as
suddenly
as
it
came
to
the
light
above
we
made
our
way
across
the
stream
and
along
aqueducts
and
over
heaps
of
shattered
walls
and
columns
to
the
west
end
of
the
group
of
ruins
this
end
is
defended
by
a
battlemented
wall
some
fifty
feet
high
which
was
built
by
the
saracens
out
of
incongruous
materials
from
older
constructions
the
northeast
corner
of
this
new
wall
rests
upon
the
ancient
phoenician
wall
which
sustained
the
original
platform
of
the
sacred
buildings
and
at
this
corner
are
found
the
three
famous
stones
which
at
one
time
gave
a
name
to
the
great
temple
as
i
do
not
intend
to
enter
into
the
details
of
these
often
described
ruins
i
will
say
here
that
this
ancient
phoenician
wall
appears
on
the
north
side
of
the
platform
detached
showing
that
the
most
ancient
temple
occupied
a
larger
area
than
the
greek
and
roman
buildings
there
are
many
stones
in
the
old
platform
wall
which
are
thirty
feet
long
but
the
three
large
ones
which
are
elevated
twenty
feet
above
the
ground
and
are
in
a
line
are
respectively
feet
long
feet
inches
and
feet
and
about
feet
in
height
and
in
depth
when
i
measured
the
first
stone
i
made
it
feet
long
which
i
knew
was
an
error
but
it
was
only
by
careful
inspection
that
i
discovered
the
joint
of
the
two
stones
which
i
had
taken
for
one
i
thought
this
a
practical
test
of
the
close
fit
of
these
blocks
which
laid
without
mortar
come
together
as
if
the
ends
had
been
polished
a
stone
larger
than
either
of
these
lies
in
the
neighboring
quarry
hewn
out
but
not
detached
these
massive
constructions
when
first
rediscovered
were
the
subject
of
a
great
deal
of
wonder
and
speculation
and
were
referred
to
a
remote
and
misty
if
not
fabulous
period
i
believe
it
is
now
agreed
that
they
were
the
work
of
the
phoenicians
or
canaanites
and
that
they
are
to
be
referred
to
a
period
subsequent
to
the
conquest
of
egypt
or
at
least
of
the
delta
of
egypt
by
the
hittites
when
the
egyptian
influence
was
felt
in
syria
and
that
this
temple
of
the
sun
was
at
least
suggested
as
well
as
the
worship
of
the
sun
god
here
by
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
heliopolis
on
the
nile
there
is
to
be
sure
no
record
of
the
great
city
of
but
it
may
safely
be
referred
to
the
period
of
the
greatest
prosperity
of
the
phoenician
nation
much
as
we
had
read
of
the
splendor
of
these
ruins
and
familiar
as
we
were
with
photographs
of
them
we
were
struck
with
surprise
when
we
climbed
up
into
the
great
court
that
is
to
the
platform
of
the
temples
the
platform
extends
over
eight
hundred
feet
from
east
to
west
an
elevated
theatre
for
the
display
of
some
of
the
richest
architecture
in
the
world
the
general
view
is
broad
impressive
inspiring
beyond
anything
else
in
egypt
or
syria
and
when
we
look
at
details
the
ruins
charm
us
with
their
beauty
round
three
sides
of
the
great
court
runs
a
wall
the
interior
of
which
recessed
and
niched
was
once
adorned
with
the
most
elaborate
carving
in
designs
more
graceful
than
you
would
suppose
stone
could
lend
itself
to
with
a
frieze
of
garlands
of
vines
flowers
and
fruits
of
the
great
temple
of
baal
at
the
west
end
of
the
platform
only
six
splendid
corinthian
columns
remain
the
temple
of
the
sun
or
jupiter
to
the
south
of
the
other
and
on
a
lower
level
larger
than
the
parthenon
exists
still
in
nearly
its
original
form
although
some
of
the
exterior
columns
have
fallen
and
time
and
the
moslems
have
defaced
some
of
its
finest
sculpture
the
ceiling
between
the
outer
row
of
columns
and
the
wall
of
this
temple
is
or
was
one
of
the
most
exquisite
pieces
of
ever
executed
the
figures
carved
in
the
medallions
seem
to
have
anticipated
the
gothic
genius
and
the
exquisite
patterns
in
stone
to
have
suggested
the
subsequent
saracenic
invention
the
composite
capitals
of
the
columns
offer
an
endless
study
stone
roses
stand
out
upon
their
stems
fruit
and
flowers
hang
and
bloom
in
the
freedom
of
nature
the
carving
is
all
bold
and
spirited
and
the
invention
endless
this
is
no
doubt
work
of
the
roman
period
after
the
christian
era
but
it
is
pervaded
by
greek
feeling
and
would
seem
to
have
been
executed
by
greek
artists
in
the
centre
of
the
great
court
there
is
a
small
court
to
the
east
of
the
larger
one
which
was
once
approached
by
a
great
flight
of
steps
from
below
are
remains
of
a
christian
basilica
referred
to
the
reign
of
theodosius
underneath
the
platform
are
enormous
vaults
which
may
have
served
the
successive
occupants
for
the
saracens
converted
this
position
into
a
fortress
and
this
military
impress
the
ruins
still
bear
we
have
therefore
four
ages
in
these
ruins
the
phoenician
the
greek
and
roman
the
christian
and
the
saracenic
the
remains
of
the
first
are
most
enduring
the
old
builders
had
no
other
method
of
perpetuating
their
memory
except
by
these
cyclopean
constructions
we
saw
the
sunset
on
the
clouds
broke
away
and
lay
in
great
rosy
masses
over
lebanon
the
white
snow
ridge
for
forty
miles
sparkled
under
them
the
peak
of
lebanon
over
ten
thousand
feet
above
us
was
revealed
in
all
its
purity
there
was
a
red
light
on
the
columns
and
on
the
walls
and
the
hills
of
red
as
a
dull
garnet
were
speckled
with
snow
patches
the
imagination
could
conceive
nothing
more
beautiful
than
the
of
the
ruins
the
flaming
sky
and
the
immaculate
snow
peaks
apparently
so
close
to
us
on
our
return
we
stopped
at
the
beautiful
circular
temple
of
venus
which
would
be
a
wonder
in
any
other
neighborhood
dinner
awaited
us
and
was
marked
by
only
one
novelty
we
at
first
took
to
be
brown
napkins
fantastically
folded
and
laid
at
each
plate
a
touch
of
elegance
for
which
we
were
not
prepared
but
the
napkins
proved
to
be
bread
it
is
made
of
coarse
dark
wheat
baked
in
circular
cakes
as
thin
as
brown
paper
and
when
folded
its
resemblance
to
a
napkin
is
complete
we
found
it
tolerably
palatable
if
one
could
get
rid
of
the
notion
that
he
was
eating
a
limp
rag
the
people
had
been
advertised
of
our
arrival
and
men
women
and
boys
swarmed
about
us
to
sell
copper
coins
most
of
them
roman
which
they
find
in
the
ruins
few
are
found
of
the
greeks
the
romans
literally
sowed
the
ground
with
copper
money
wherever
they
went
in
the
orient
the
inhabitants
are
moslems
and
rather
decent
in
appearance
and
the
women
incline
to
good
looks
though
not
so
modest
in
dress
as
moslem
women
usually
are
they
are
all
persistent
beggars
and
bring
babies
in
their
arms
borrowing
for
that
purpose
all
the
infants
in
the
neighborhood
to
incite
us
to
charity
we
yielded
to
the
average
sentiment
of
christendom
and
sallied
out
in
the
cold
night
to
see
the
ruins
under
the
light
of
a
full
moon
one
of
the
party
going
simply
that
he
might
avoid
the
reproach
of
other
travellers
is
a
pity
you
did
not
see
by
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
these
ruins
stand
the
dim
light
of
the
moon
better
than
most
ruins
they
are
so
broad
and
distinct
that
they
show
themselves
even
in
this
disadvantage
which
those
of
karnak
do
not
the
six
isolated
columns
seemed
to
float
in
the
sky
between
them
snowy
lebanon
showed
itself
the
next
morning
was
clear
and
sparkling
the
sky
was
almost
as
blue
as
it
is
in
nubia
we
were
awakened
by
the
drumming
of
a
moslem
procession
it
was
the
great
annual
fête
day
upon
which
was
to
be
performed
the
miracle
of
riding
over
the
bodies
of
the
devout
the
ceremony
took
place
a
couple
of
miles
away
upon
the
hill
and
we
saw
on
all
the
paths
leading
thither
files
of
men
and
women
in
white
garments
the
sheykh
mounted
on
horseback
rides
over
the
prostrate
bodies
of
all
who
throw
themselves
before
him
and
the
number
includes
young
men
as
well
as
darwishes
as
they
lie
packed
close
together
and
the
horse
treads
upon
their
spinal
columns
their
escape
from
death
is
called
miraculous
the
christians
tried
the
experiment
here
a
year
or
two
ago
several
young
fellows
submitting
to
let
a
horseman
trample
over
them
in
order
to
show
the
moslems
that
they
also
possessed
a
religion
which
could
stand
horses
hoofs
the
ruins
under
the
intense
blue
sky
and
in
the
splendid
sunlight
were
more
impressive
than
in
the
dull
gray
of
the
day
before
or
even
in
the
rosy
sunset
their
imperial
dignity
is
not
impaired
by
the
excessive
wealth
of
ornamentation
when
upon
this
platform
there
stood
of
these
noble
columns
instead
of
six
conspicuous
from
afar
and
the
sunlight
poured
into
this
superb
court
adorned
by
the
genius
of
athens
and
the
wealth
of
rome
this
must
have
been
one
of
the
most
resplendent
temples
in
existence
rivalling
the
group
upon
the
acropolis
itself
nothing
more
marks
the
contrast
between
the
religions
of
the
greeks
and
romans
and
of
the
egyptians
or
rather
between
the
genius
of
the
two
civilizations
than
their
treatment
of
sacred
edifices
and
it
is
all
the
more
to
be
noted
because
the
more
modern
nations
accepted
without
reserve
any
god
or
object
of
veneration
or
mystery
in
the
egyptian
pantheon
the
roman
occupants
of
the
temple
of
philæ
sacrificed
without
scruple
upon
the
altars
of
osiris
and
the
voluptuous
of
pompeii
built
a
temple
to
isis
yet
always
and
everywhere
the
grecians
and
the
romans
sought
conspicuous
situations
for
the
temples
of
the
gods
they
felt
as
did
our
pilgrim
fathers
who
planted
their
on
the
windiest
hills
of
new
england
that
the
deity
was
most
honored
when
the
house
of
his
worship
was
most
visible
to
men
but
the
egyptians
on
the
contrary
buried
the
magnificence
of
their
temples
within
wall
around
wall
and
permitted
not
a
hint
of
their
splendor
to
the
world
outside
it
is
worth
while
to
notice
also
that
the
assyrians
did
not
share
the
contemporary
reticence
of
the
egyptians
but
built
their
altars
and
temples
high
above
the
plain
in
pyramidal
stages
and
if
we
may
judge
by
this
platform
at
the
phoenicians
did
not
imitate
the
exclusive
spirit
of
the
pharaonic
worshippers
we
lingered
called
again
and
again
by
the
impatient
dragoman
in
this
fascinating
spot
amid
the
visible
monuments
of
so
many
great
races
bearing
the
marks
of
so
many
religious
revolutions
and
turned
away
with
slow
and
reluctant
steps
as
those
who
abandon
an
illusion
or
have
not
yet
thought
out
some
suggestion
of
the
imagination
we
turned
also
with
reluctance
from
a
real
illusion
of
the
senses
in
the
clear
atmosphere
the
ridge
of
lebanon
was
startlingly
near
to
us
the
snow
summit
appeared
to
overhang
as
vesuvius
does
pompeii
and
yet
it
is
half
a
day
journey
across
the
plain
to
the
base
of
the
mountain
and
a
whole
day
journey
from
these
ruins
to
the
summit
but
although
this
illusion
of
distance
did
not
continue
as
we
rode
down
the
valley
we
had
on
either
hand
the
snow
ranges
all
day
making
by
contrast
with
the
brilliant
colors
of
the
plain
a
lovely
picture
the
road
to
damascus
the
station
at
stoura
is
a
big
stable
and
a
dirty
little
inn
which
has
the
kitchen
in
one
shanty
the
in
another
and
the
beds
in
a
third
a
swift
mountain
stream
runs
behind
it
and
a
grove
of
poplars
on
the
banks
moans
and
rustles
in
the
wind
that
draws
down
the
lebanon
gorge
it
was
after
dark
when
we
arrived
but
whether
our
coming
put
the
establishment
into
a
fluster
i
doubt
it
seems
to
be
in
a
chronic
state
of
excitement
the
inn
was
kept
by
italians
who
have
a
genius
for
this
sort
of
hotel
the
landlord
was
andrea
but
i
suspect
the
real
authority
resided
in
his
plump
bright
vivacious
wife
they
had
an
heir
however
a
boy
of
eight
who
proved
to
be
the
tyrant
of
the
house
when
he
appeared
upon
the
scene
the
servants
were
a
tall
slender
syrian
girl
an
active
and
irresponsible
boy
and
a
little
maid
in
the
limp
and
dirty
single
garment
which
orphans
always
wear
on
the
stage
and
who
in
fact
was
an
orphan
and
appeared
to
take
the
full
benefit
of
her
neglected
and
jolly
life
the
whole
establishment
was
on
a
lark
and
in
a
perpetual
giggle
and
communicated
its
overflowing
even
to
tired
travellers
the
little
wife
who
exhibited
the
extremes
of
fortune
in
a
diamond
ring
and
a
torn
and
draggled
calico
gown
sputtered
alternately
french
and
italian
like
a
magpie
laughed
with
a
contagious
merriment
and
actually
made
the
cheerless
accommodations
she
offered
us
appear
desirable
the
whole
family
waited
on
us
or
rather
kept
us
waiting
on
them
at
table
bringing
us
a
dish
now
and
then
as
if
its
production
were
a
joke
talking
all
the
while
among
themselves
in
arabic
and
apparently
about
us
and
laughing
at
their
own
observations
until
we
even
came
to
conceive
ourselves
as
a
party
in
a
most
comical
light
and
so
amusing
did
we
grow
that
the
slim
girl
and
the
sorry
orphan
were
forced
to
rush
into
a
corner
every
few
minutes
and
laugh
it
out
i
spent
a
pleasant
hour
in
the
kitchen
isolated
room
with
an
earth
floor
to
warm
my
feet
at
the
little
fires
of
charcoal
kindled
in
holes
on
top
of
a
bank
of
earth
and
stone
and
watching
the
pranks
of
this
merry
and
industrious
family
the
little
heir
amused
himself
by
pounding
the
orphan
kicking
the
shins
of
the
boy
and
dashing
water
in
the
face
of
the
slim
girl
which
the
servants
dared
not
resent
since
the
father
laughed
over
it
as
an
exhibition
of
bravery
and
vivacity
fragrant
steam
came
from
a
pot
in
which
quail
were
stewing
for
the
passengers
by
the
night
mail
and
each
person
who
appeared
in
the
kitchen
in
turn
gave
this
pot
a
stir
the
lively
boy
pounded
coffee
in
a
big
mortar
put
charcoal
on
the
fire
had
a
tussle
with
the
heir
threw
a
handspring
doing
nothing
a
minute
at
a
time
the
orphan
slid
in
with
a
bucket
of
water
slopping
it
in
all
directions
the
heir
set
up
a
howl
and
kicked
his
father
because
he
was
not
allowed
to
kick
the
orphan
any
more
the
little
wife
came
in
like
a
breeze
whisking
everybody
one
side
and
sympathized
with
dear
little
hobby
whose
cruel
and
ugly
papa
was
holding
the
love
from
barking
his
father
shins
you
do
not
often
see
a
family
that
enjoys
itself
so
much
as
this
it
was
late
next
morning
when
we
tore
ourselves
from
this
enchanting
household
and
went
at
a
good
pace
over
the
fertile
plain
straight
towards
having
a
glimpse
of
the
snow
of
mount
hermon
long
ridge
peering
over
the
hills
to
the
southeast
and
crossing
in
turn
the
litany
and
the
deep
anjar
which
bursts
forth
from
a
single
fountain
about
a
mile
to
the
north
on
our
left
we
saw
some
remains
of
what
was
once
a
capital
city
chalcis
of
unknown
origin
but
an
old
city
before
it
was
possessed
by
the
ptolemies
or
by
mark
antony
and
once
the
luxurious
residence
of
the
herod
family
at
medjel
a
village
scattered
at
the
foot
of
small
tells
rising
in
the
plain
we
turned
into
the
hills
leaving
unvisited
a
conspicuous
roman
temple
on
a
peak
above
the
town
the
road
winds
gradually
up
a
wady
as
we
left
the
plain
and
looked
back
across
it
to
lebanon
the
colors
of
bukâ
and
the
mountain
gave
us
a
new
surprise
they
were
brilliant
and
yet
soft
as
gay
and
splendid
as
the
rocks
of
the
yellowstone
and
yet
exquisitely
blended
as
in
a
persian
rug
the
was
almost
uninhabited
except
the
stations
and
an
occasional
bedaween
camp
there
was
small
sign
of
occupation
the
ground
was
uncultivated
peasants
in
rags
were
grubbing
up
the
roots
of
cedars
for
fuel
we
met
druses
with
trains
of
mules
moslems
with
camels
and
mules
and
long
processions
of
wagons
the
western
each
by
three
mules
tandem
thirty
and
forty
of
these
freight
vehicles
travel
in
company
and
we
were
continually
meeting
or
passing
them
their
number
is
an
indication
of
the
large
trade
that
damascus
has
with
beyrout
and
the
mediterranean
there
is
plenty
of
color
in
the
people
and
in
their
costume
we
were
told
that
we
could
distinguish
the
druses
by
their
furtive
and
bad
countenances
but
for
this
information
i
should
not
have
seen
that
they
differed
much
from
the
maronites
but
i
endeavored
to
see
the
treacherous
villain
in
them
i
have
noticed
in
syria
that
the
catholic
travellers
have
a
good
opinion
of
the
maronites
and
hate
the
druses
that
the
american
residents
think
little
of
the
maronites
and
that
the
english
have
a
lenient
side
for
the
druses
the
moslems
consistently
despise
all
of
them
the
druse
has
been
a
puzzle
there
are
the
same
horrible
stories
current
about
him
that
were
believed
of
the
early
christians
the
moslem
believes
that
infants
are
slain
and
eaten
in
his
midnight
assemblies
and
that
once
a
year
the
druse
community
meets
in
a
cavern
at
midnight
the
lights
are
extinguished
and
the
sexes
mingling
by
chance
in
the
license
of
darkness
choose
companions
for
the
year
but
the
druse
creed
long
a
secret
is
now
known
they
are
the
disciples
of
hâkim
a
khalif
of
the
fatimite
dynasty
they
believe
in
the
unity
of
god
and
his
latest
manifestation
in
hakim
they
are
as
much
a
political
as
a
religious
society
they
are
accomplished
hypocrites
cunning
in
plotting
and
bold
in
action
they
profess
to
possess
truth
and
having
this
they
are
indifferent
to
externals
and
are
willing
to
be
moslems
with
the
moslems
and
christians
with
the
christians
while
inwardly
feeling
a
contempt
for
both
they
are
the
most
supercilious
of
all
the
eastern
sects
what
they
are
about
to
do
is
always
the
subject
of
anxiety
in
the
lebanon
regions
at
the
stations
of
the
road
we
found
usually
a
wretched
family
or
two
dwelling
in
a
shanty
half
stable
and
half
café
always
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
the
superabundant
fountains
for
nourishing
it
displayed
to
all
the
world
generally
some
slatternly
girls
and
groups
of
rough
muleteers
and
drivers
smoking
at
one
i
remember
a
jew
who
sold
antique
gems
rings
and
coins
with
a
shocking
face
which
not
only
suggested
the
first
fall
of
his
race
but
all
the
advantages
he
has
since
taken
of
his
innocent
fellows
by
reason
of
his
preoccupation
of
his
position
of
knowledge
and
depravity
we
made
always
except
in
the
steep
ascents
about
ten
miles
an
hour
the
management
of
the
route
is
the
perfection
of
french
system
and
bureaucracy
we
travel
with
a
of
numbered
details
as
if
we
were
a
royal
mail
at
every
station
we
change
one
horse
so
that
we
always
have
a
fresh
animal
the
is
at
every
station
signed
by
the
agent
and
the
minute
of
arrival
and
departure
exactly
noted
each
horse
has
its
number
and
the
number
of
the
one
taken
and
the
one
left
is
entered
all
is
life
and
promptness
at
the
stations
changes
are
quickly
made
the
would
show
the
company
the
exact
time
between
stations
but
i
noticed
that
our
driver
continually
set
his
watch
backwards
and
forwards
and
i
found
that
he
and
the
dragoman
had
a
private
understanding
to
conceal
our
delays
for
lunch
for
traffic
with
jews
or
for
the
enjoyment
of
scenery
after
we
had
crossed
the
summit
of
the
first
ridge
we
dashed
down
the
gate
of
a
magnificent
canyon
the
rocks
heaved
up
in
perpendicular
strata
overhanging
craggy
crumbled
wild
we
crossed
then
a
dreary
and
nearly
arid
basin
climbed
by
curves
and
zigzags
another
ridge
and
then
went
rapidly
down
until
we
struck
the
wild
and
narrow
gorge
of
the
sacred
abana
immediately
luxuriant
vegetable
life
began
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
blossoms
of
the
apricot
and
splendid
walnuts
and
poplars
overshadowed
us
the
river
swollen
and
rushing
amid
the
trees
on
its
hanks
was
frightfully
rapid
the
valley
winds
sharply
and
gives
room
only
for
the
river
and
the
road
and
sometimes
only
for
one
of
them
sometimes
the
river
is
taken
out
of
its
bed
and
carried
along
one
bank
or
the
other
sometimes
the
road
crosses
it
and
again
pursues
its
way
between
its
divided
streams
we
were
excited
by
its
rush
and
volume
and
by
the
rich
vegetation
along
its
sides
we
came
to
fantastic
saracenic
to
arcaded
and
latticed
houses
set
high
up
over
the
river
to
evidences
of
wealth
and
of
proximity
to
a
great
city
suddenly
for
we
seemed
to
have
become
a
part
of
the
rushing
torrent
and
to
share
its
rapidity
we
burst
out
of
the
gorge
and
saw
the
river
overpassing
its
narrow
banks
flowing
straight
on
before
us
and
beyond
on
a
level
the
minarets
and
domes
of
damascus
all
along
the
river
on
both
banks
of
it
and
along
the
high
wall
by
the
roadside
were
crowds
of
men
in
turkish
costume
of
women
in
pure
white
of
arabs
sitting
quietly
by
the
stream
smoking
the
narghileh
squatting
in
rows
along
the
wall
and
along
the
water
all
pulling
at
the
there
were
tents
and
booths
erected
by
the
river
in
a
further
reach
of
it
men
and
boys
were
bathing
hanks
and
groups
of
veiled
women
and
children
crouched
on
the
damp
soil
close
to
the
flood
or
sat
immovable
on
some
sandy
point
it
is
a
delicious
holiday
for
two
or
three
women
to
sit
the
livelong
day
by
water
running
or
stagnant
to
sit
there
with
their
veils
drawn
over
their
heads
as
rooted
as
and
as
inanimate
as
bags
of
flour
it
was
a
striking
oriental
picture
played
on
by
the
sun
enlivened
by
the
swift
current
which
dashes
full
into
the
city
as
we
spun
on
the
crowd
thickened
grave
turks
on
caparisoned
horses
or
white
donkeys
jews
blacks
persians
we
crossed
a
trembling
bridge
and
rattled
into
town
over
stony
pavements
forced
our
way
with
difficulty
into
streets
narrow
and
broken
by
sharp
turns
the
scarcely
missing
men
and
children
stretched
on
the
ground
who
refused
on
the
theory
of
their
occupation
of
the
soil
prior
to
the
invention
of
wheels
to
draw
in
even
a
leg
and
in
a
confused
whirl
of
novel
sights
and
discordant
yells
barks
and
objurgations
we
came
to
dimitri
hotel
the
carriage
stopped
in
the
narrow
street
a
small
door
in
the
wall
a
couple
of
feet
above
the
pavement
opened
and
we
stepped
through
into
a
little
court
occupied
by
a
fountain
and
an
loaded
with
golden
fruit
thence
we
passed
into
a
large
court
the
centre
of
the
hotel
where
the
abana
pours
a
generous
supply
into
a
vast
marble
basin
and
trees
and
shrubs
offer
shelter
to
singing
birds
about
us
was
a
wilderness
of
balconies
staircases
and
corridors
the
sun
flooding
it
all
and
dimitri
himself
sleek
hospitable
stood
bowing
in
a
red
fez
silk
gown
and
long
gold
chain
oldest
of
cities
it
is
a
popular
opinion
that
there
is
nothing
of
man
work
older
than
damascus
there
is
certainly
nothing
newer
the
city
preserves
its
personal
identity
as
a
man
keeps
his
from
youth
to
age
through
the
constant
change
of
substance
the
man
has
in
his
body
not
an
atom
of
the
boy
but
if
the
boy
incurred
scars
they
are
perpetuated
in
the
man
damascus
has
some
scars
we
say
of
other
ancient
cities
part
is
old
that
part
is
we
say
of
damascus
its
life
is
that
of
a
tree
decayed
at
heart
dropping
branches
casting
leaves
but
always
renewing
itself
how
old
is
damascus
or
rather
how
long
has
a
city
of
that
name
existed
here
on
the
banks
of
the
abana
according
to
jewish
tradition
which
we
have
no
reason
to
doubt
it
was
founded
by
uz
the
son
of
aram
the
son
of
shem
by
the
same
tradition
it
was
a
great
city
when
a
remarkable
man
of
the
tenth
generation
from
the
deluge
person
of
great
sagacity
not
mistaken
in
his
opinions
skilful
in
the
celestial
science
compelled
to
leave
chaldea
when
he
was
years
old
on
account
of
his
religious
opinions
since
he
ventured
to
publish
the
notion
that
there
was
but
one
god
the
creator
of
the
universe
with
an
army
of
dependants
and
in
the
city
of
uz
after
some
time
abraham
removed
into
canaan
which
was
already
occupied
by
the
canaanites
who
had
come
from
the
persian
gulf
established
themselves
in
in
the
hills
built
sidon
on
the
coast
and
carried
their
conquests
into
egypt
it
was
doubtless
during
the
reign
of
the
hittites
or
shepherd
kings
that
abraham
visited
egypt
those
usurpers
occupied
the
throne
of
the
pharaohs
for
something
like
five
hundred
years
and
it
was
during
their
occupancy
that
the
jews
settled
in
the
delta
now
if
we
can
at
all
fix
the
date
of
the
reign
of
the
shepherd
kings
we
can
approximate
to
the
date
of
the
foundation
of
damascus
for
uz
was
the
third
generation
from
noah
and
abraham
was
the
tenth
we
do
not
know
how
to
reckon
a
generation
in
those
days
when
a
was
such
a
valuable
estate
but
if
we
should
assume
it
to
be
a
century
we
should
have
about
seven
hundred
years
between
the
foundation
of
damascus
and
the
visit
of
abraham
to
egypt
a
very
liberal
margin
but
by
the
chronology
of
mariette
bey
the
approximate
date
of
the
invasion
is
to
and
somewhat
later
than
that
time
abraham
was
in
damascus
if
damascus
was
then
seven
hundred
years
old
the
date
of
its
foundation
would
be
about
to
assuming
that
damascus
has
this
positive
old
age
how
old
is
it
comparatively
when
we
regard
it
in
this
light
we
are
obliged
to
confess
that
it
is
a
modern
city
when
uz
and
his
friends
wandered
out
of
the
prolific
east
and
pitched
their
tents
by
the
abana
there
was
already
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
a
civilized
polished
race
which
had
nearly
completed
a
cycle
of
national
existence
much
longer
than
the
duration
of
the
roman
empire
it
was
about
the
eleventh
dynasty
of
the
egyptian
kingdom
the
great
pyramid
had
been
built
more
than
a
thousand
years
and
the
already
degenerate
egyptians
of
the
had
forgotten
the
noble
art
which
adorned
and
still
renders
illustrious
the
reigns
of
the
but
if
damascus
can
not
claim
the
highest
antiquity
it
has
outlived
all
its
rivals
on
the
earth
and
has
flourished
in
a
freshness
as
perennial
as
the
fountain
to
which
it
owes
its
life
through
all
the
revolutions
of
the
orient
as
a
necessary
commercial
capital
it
has
pursued
a
pretty
uniform
tenor
under
all
its
various
masters
attempted
to
destroy
it
it
was
a
babylonian
and
then
a
persian
satrapy
for
centuries
it
was
a
greek
city
it
was
the
capital
of
a
roman
province
for
seven
hundred
years
it
was
a
christian
city
and
reared
a
great
temple
to
john
the
baptist
it
was
the
capital
of
the
saracenic
empire
in
which
resided
the
ruler
who
gave
laws
to
all
the
lands
from
india
to
spain
it
was
ravaged
by
tamerlane
it
now
suffers
the
blight
of
turkish
imbecility
from
of
old
it
was
a
caravan
station
and
a
mart
of
exchange
a
camp
by
a
stream
it
is
a
commercial
hive
swarming
with
an
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
a
city
without
monuments
of
its
past
or
ambition
for
its
future
if
one
could
see
damascus
perhaps
he
could
invent
a
phrase
that
would
describe
it
but
when
you
have
groped
and
stumbled
about
in
it
for
a
couple
of
weeks
endeavoring
in
vain
to
get
a
view
of
more
than
a
few
rods
of
it
at
a
time
you
are
utterly
at
a
loss
how
to
convey
an
impression
of
it
to
others
if
egypt
is
the
gift
of
the
nile
the
river
abana
is
the
life
of
damascus
its
water
is
carried
into
the
city
on
a
dozen
different
levels
making
it
literally
one
of
fountains
and
running
water
sometimes
the
town
is
flooded
the
water
had
only
just
subsided
from
the
hotel
when
we
arrived
this
inundation
makes
the
city
damp
for
a
long
time
indeed
it
is
at
all
times
rather
soaked
with
water
and
all
respect
to
uz
and
abraham
and
the
dynasty
of
the
sort
of
habitable
on
a
grand
scale
at
night
the
noise
of
frogs
even
at
our
hotel
is
the
chief
music
the
gentle
twilight
song
broken
it
is
true
by
the
incessant
howling
and
yelping
of
savage
dogs
packs
of
which
roam
the
city
like
wolves
all
night
they
are
mangy
yellow
curs
without
a
single
good
quality
except
that
they
sleep
all
the
daytime
in
every
quarter
of
the
city
you
see
ranks
and
rows
of
them
asleep
in
the
sun
occupying
half
the
street
and
nestling
in
all
the
heaps
of
rubbish
but
much
as
has
been
said
of
the
dogs
here
i
think
the
frogs
are
the
feature
of
the
town
they
are
as
numerous
as
in
the
marshes
of
ravenna
still
the
water
could
not
be
spared
it
gives
sparkle
life
verdure
in
walking
you
constantly
get
glimpses
through
heavy
doorways
of
fountains
marble
tanks
of
running
water
of
a
blooming
tree
or
a
in
a
marble
court
of
a
garden
of
flowers
the
crooked
twisted
narrow
streets
mere
lanes
of
would
be
scarcely
endurable
but
for
these
occasional
glimpses
and
the
sight
now
and
then
of
the
paved
pillared
court
of
a
gayly
painted
mosque
one
ought
not
to
complain
when
the
arab
barber
who
trims
his
hair
gives
him
a
narghileh
to
smoke
during
the
operation
but
damascus
is
not
so
oriental
as
cairo
the
predominant
turkish
element
is
not
so
picturesque
as
the
egyptian
and
this
must
be
said
in
the
face
of
the
universal
use
of
the
narghileh
which
more
than
any
other
one
thing
imparts
an
oriental
luxurious
tone
to
the
city
the
pipe
of
egypt
is
the
chibouk
a
stem
of
cherry
five
feet
long
with
a
small
clay
bowl
however
richly
it
may
be
ornamented
furnished
with
a
costly
amber
mouthpiece
wound
with
wire
of
gold
and
studded
as
it
often
is
with
diamonds
and
other
stones
of
price
it
is
at
the
best
a
stiff
affair
and
even
this
pipe
is
more
and
more
displaced
by
the
cigar
just
as
in
germany
the
meerschaum
has
yielded
to
the
cigar
as
the
germans
have
become
accessible
to
foreign
influences
but
in
damascus
the
picturesque
narghileh
encourager
of
idleness
is
still
the
universal
medium
of
smoke
the
management
of
the
narghileh
requires
that
a
person
should
give
his
undivided
mind
to
it
in
return
for
that
it
gives
him
peace
the
simplest
narghileh
is
a
with
a
flexible
stem
attached
and
an
open
metal
bowl
on
top
for
the
tobacco
the
smoke
is
drawn
through
the
water
which
the
shell
contains
other
narghilehs
have
a
glass
standard
and
and
a
flexible
stem
two
or
three
yards
in
length
the
smoker
seated
before
this
graceful
object
appears
to
be
worshipping
his
idol
the
mild
persian
tobacco
is
kept
alight
by
a
slowly
burning
piece
of
dried
refuse
which
is
kindly
furnished
by
the
camel
for
fuel
and
the
smoke
is
inhaled
into
the
lungs
and
slowly
expelled
from
the
nostrils
and
the
mouth
although
the
hastily
rolled
cigarette
is
the
resort
of
the
poor
in
egypt
and
is
somewhat
used
here
it
must
be
a
very
abandoned
wretch
who
can
not
afford
a
pull
at
a
narghileh
in
damascus
its
universality
must
excuse
the
long
paragraph
i
have
devoted
to
this
pipe
you
see
men
smoking
it
in
all
the
cafés
in
all
the
shops
by
the
roadside
seated
in
the
streets
in
every
garden
and
on
the
the
visible
occupation
of
damascus
is
sucking
this
pipe
our
first
walk
in
the
city
was
on
sunday
to
the
church
of
the
presbyterian
mission
on
our
way
we
threaded
a
wilderness
of
bazaars
nearly
all
of
them
roofed
over
most
of
them
sombre
and
gloomy
only
in
the
glaring
heat
of
summer
could
they
be
agreeable
places
of
refuge
the
roofing
of
these
tortuous
streets
and
lanes
is
not
so
much
to
exclude
the
sun
i
imagine
as
to
keep
out
the
snow
and
the
roofs
are
consequently
substantial
for
damascus
has
an
experience
of
winter
being
hundred
feet
above
the
nearly
as
high
as
jerusalem
these
bazaars
so
much
vaunted
all
through
the
orient
disappointed
us
not
in
extent
for
they
are
interminable
but
in
wanting
the
picturesqueness
oddity
and
richness
of
those
of
cairo
and
this
like
the
general
appearance
of
the
city
is
a
disappointment
hard
to
be
borne
for
we
have
been
taught
to
believe
that
damascus
is
a
paradise
on
earth
and
that
here
if
anywhere
we
should
come
into
that
region
of
enchantment
which
the
poets
of
the
arabian
nights
tales
have
imposed
upon
us
as
the
actual
orient
should
we
have
recognized
in
the
low
and
partially
flooded
strip
of
grassland
through
which
we
drove
from
the
mouth
of
the
abana
gorge
to
the
western
gate
of
the
city
the
green
merj
of
the
arabian
poets
that
gem
of
the
earth
the
fame
of
it
has
gone
abroad
throughout
the
world
as
if
it
were
a
unique
gift
of
allah
to
his
favorites
why
every
occidental
land
has
a
million
glades
watered
more
lovely
than
this
that
no
poet
has
thought
it
worth
while
to
celebrate
we
found
a
little
handful
of
worshippers
at
the
mission
church
and
among
forgive
us
for
looking
at
her
on
sunday
eccentric
and
somewhat
notorious
english
lady
of
title
who
shares
the
bed
and
board
of
an
arab
sheykh
in
his
harem
outside
the
walls
it
makes
me
blush
for
the
attractiveness
of
my
own
country
and
the
slighted
fascination
of
the
noble
red
man
in
his
paint
and
shoddy
blanket
when
i
see
a
lady
sated
with
the
tame
civilization
of
england
throw
herself
into
the
arms
of
one
of
these
coarse
bigamists
of
the
desert
has
he
no
reputation
in
the
mother
country
our
noble
chivalrous
we
saw
something
of
the
missionaries
of
damascus
but
as
i
was
not
of
the
established
religion
at
the
court
of
washington
at
the
time
of
my
departure
from
home
and
had
no
commission
to
report
to
the
government
either
upon
the
condition
of
consulates
or
of
religion
abroad
i
am
not
prepared
to
remark
much
upon
the
state
of
either
in
this
city
i
should
say
however
that
not
many
direct
converts
were
made
either
from
moslemism
or
from
other
christian
beliefs
but
that
incalculable
good
is
accomplished
by
the
schools
which
the
missionaries
conduct
the
influence
of
these
in
encouraging
a
disposition
to
read
and
to
inquire
into
the
truth
and
into
the
conditions
of
a
better
civilization
is
not
to
be
overestimated
what
impressed
me
most
however
in
the
fortune
of
these
able
faithful
servants
of
the
propagandism
of
christian
civilization
was
their
pathetic
isolation
a
gentleman
and
his
wife
of
this
mission
had
been
thirty
years
absent
from
the
united
states
the
friends
who
cheered
or
regretted
their
departure
who
cried
over
them
and
prayed
over
them
and
followed
them
with
tender
messages
had
passed
away
or
become
so
much
absorbed
in
the
life
at
home
as
to
have
almost
forgotten
those
who
had
gone
away
to
the
heathen
a
generation
ago
the
mission
board
that
personally
knew
them
and
lovingly
cared
for
them
is
now
composed
of
strangers
to
them
they
were
in
fact
expatriated
lost
sight
of
and
yet
they
had
gained
no
country
nor
any
sympathies
to
supply
the
place
of
those
lost
they
must
always
be
to
a
great
degree
strangers
in
this
fierce
barbarous
city
we
wandered
down
through
the
christian
quarter
of
the
town
few
shops
are
here
we
were
most
of
the
time
walking
between
which
have
a
door
now
and
then
this
quarter
is
new
it
was
entirely
burned
by
the
moslems
and
druses
in
when
no
less
than
hundred
adult
male
christians
heads
of
families
were
slaughtered
and
thousands
more
perished
of
wounds
and
famine
consequent
upon
the
total
destruction
of
their
property
that
the
druses
were
incited
to
this
persecution
by
the
turkish
rulers
is
generally
believed
we
went
out
of
the
city
by
the
eastern
gate
called
bab
shurky
which
name
profanely
suggested
the
irrelevant
colored
image
of
bob
sharkey
and
found
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
huge
mounds
of
rubbish
the
accumulations
of
refuse
carted
out
of
the
city
during
many
centuries
which
entirely
concealed
from
view
the
country
beyond
we
skirted
these
for
a
while
with
the
crumbling
city
wall
on
the
left
hand
passed
through
the
hard
gray
desolate
turkish
cemetery
and
came
at
length
into
what
might
be
called
country
not
that
we
could
see
any
country
however
we
were
always
between
high
and
could
see
nothing
beyond
them
except
the
sky
unless
we
stepped
through
an
open
door
into
a
garden
into
one
of
these
gardens
a
public
one
and
one
of
the
most
celebrated
in
the
rhapsodies
of
travellers
and
by
the
inventive
poets
we
finally
turned
when
you
are
walking
for
pleasure
in
your
native
land
and
indulging
a
rural
feeling
would
you
voluntarily
go
into
a
damp
swale
and
sit
on
a
moist
sod
under
a
willow
this
garden
is
low
considerably
lower
than
the
city
which
has
gradually
elevated
itself
on
its
own
decay
and
is
cut
by
little
canals
or
sluiceways
fed
by
the
abana
which
run
with
a
good
current
the
ground
is
well
covered
with
coarse
grass
of
the
vivid
green
that
one
finds
usually
in
low
ground
and
is
liberally
sprinkled
with
a
growth
of
willows
and
poplars
in
this
garden
of
the
hesperides
in
which
there
are
few
if
any
flowers
and
no
promise
of
fruit
there
is
a
rough
wooden
shed
rickety
and
decaying
having
if
i
remember
rightly
a
balcony
must
have
a
balcony
there
pipes
poor
lemonade
and
poorer
ice
cream
are
served
to
customers
an
arab
band
of
four
persons
one
of
them
of
course
blind
of
an
eye
seated
on
a
sort
of
bedstead
was
picking
and
thumping
a
monotonous
tune
out
of
the
usual
instruments
you
could
not
deny
that
the
vivid
greenery
and
the
gayly
apparelled
groups
sitting
about
under
the
trees
and
on
the
water
edge
made
a
lively
scene
in
another
garden
farther
on
around
the
wall
the
shanty
of
entertainment
is
a
shaky
construction
or
a
series
of
platforms
and
terraces
of
wood
overhanging
the
swift
abana
in
the
daytime
it
is
but
a
shabby
sight
but
at
night
when
a
thousand
colored
globes
light
it
without
revealing
its
poverty
and
the
lights
dance
in
the
water
and
hundreds
of
turbaned
gowned
and
lounge
in
the
galleries
or
gracefully
take
their
ease
by
the
sparkling
current
and
the
faint
thump
of
the
darabouka
is
heard
and
some
gesticulating
mounted
upon
a
bench
is
reeling
off
to
an
attentive
audience
an
interminable
arabian
tale
you
might
fancy
that
the
romance
of
the
orient
is
not
all
invented
of
other
and
private
gardens
and
enclosures
we
had
glimpses
on
our
walk
through
open
gates
and
occasionally
over
the
walls
we
could
imagine
what
a
fragrance
and
color
would
greet
the
senses
when
the
apricots
are
in
bloom
and
the
oranges
and
lemons
in
flower
and
how
beautiful
the
view
might
be
if
the
ugly
walls
did
not
conceal
it
we
returned
by
the
saddlers
bazaar
and
by
a
famous
which
may
be
as
old
as
the
moslem
religion
its
gnarled
limbs
are
like
the
stems
of
ordinary
trees
and
its
trunk
is
forty
feet
around
the
remark
that
damascus
is
without
monuments
of
its
past
needs
qualification
it
was
made
with
reference
to
its
existence
before
the
christian
era
and
in
comparison
with
other
capitals
of
antiquity
remains
may
indeed
be
met
in
its
exterior
walls
and
in
a
broken
column
here
and
there
built
into
a
modern
house
of
roman
workmanship
and
its
great
mosque
is
an
historical
monument
of
great
interest
if
not
of
the
highest
antiquity
in
its
structure
it
represents
three
religions
and
three
periods
of
art
like
the
mosque
of
sophia
at
constantinople
it
was
for
centuries
a
christian
cathedral
like
the
dome
of
the
rock
at
jerusalem
it
is
built
upon
a
spot
consecrated
by
the
most
ancient
religious
rites
situated
in
the
midst
of
the
most
densely
peopled
part
of
the
city
and
pressed
on
all
sides
by
its
most
crowded
bazaars
occupying
a
quadrangle
nearly
five
hundred
feet
one
way
by
over
three
hundred
the
other
the
wanderer
among
the
shops
is
constantly
coming
to
one
side
or
another
of
it
and
getting
glimpses
through
the
spacious
portals
of
the
colonnaded
court
within
hemmed
in
as
it
is
it
is
only
by
diving
into
many
alleys
and
pushing
one
way
into
the
rear
of
dirty
shops
and
climbing
upon
the
roofs
of
houses
that
one
can
get
any
idea
of
the
exterior
of
the
mosque
it
is
indeed
only
from
an
eminence
that
you
can
see
its
three
beautiful
minarets
it
does
not
appear
that
chosroes
the
persian
who
encamped
his
army
in
the
delicious
gardens
of
damascus
in
the
year
when
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
and
the
massacre
of
its
christian
inhabitants
disturbed
the
church
of
john
the
baptist
in
this
city
but
twenty
years
later
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
saracens
who
for
a
few
years
were
content
to
share
it
with
the
christian
worshippers
it
is
said
that
when
khâled
the
most
redoubtable
of
the
friends
of
the
prophet
whose
deeds
entitled
him
to
the
sobriquet
of
the
sword
of
god
entered
this
old
church
he
asked
to
be
conducted
into
the
sacred
vault
which
is
now
beneath
the
kubbeh
of
the
mosque
and
that
he
was
there
shown
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
in
a
gold
casket
which
had
in
greek
this
inscription
casket
contains
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
son
of
the
building
had
been
then
for
over
three
centuries
a
christian
church
and
already
when
constantine
dedicated
it
to
christian
use
it
had
for
over
three
hundred
years
witnessed
the
worship
of
pagan
deities
the
present
edifice
is
much
shorn
of
its
original
splendor
and
proportions
but
sufficient
remains
to
show
that
it
was
a
worthy
rival
of
the
temples
of
palmyra
and
jerusalem
no
part
of
the
building
is
older
than
the
roman
occupation
but
the
antiquarians
are
agreed
to
think
that
this
was
the
site
of
the
old
syrian
temple
in
which
ahaz
saw
the
beautiful
altar
which
he
reproduced
in
the
temple
at
jerusalem
pieces
of
superb
carving
recalling
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
may
still
be
found
in
some
of
the
gateways
and
the
noble
corinthian
columns
of
the
interior
are
to
be
referred
to
roman
or
greek
workmen
christian
art
is
represented
in
the
building
in
some
part
of
the
walls
and
in
the
windows
and
the
moslems
have
superimposed
upon
all
minarets
a
dome
and
the
gay
decorations
of
colored
marbles
and
flaring
inscriptions
the
moslems
have
either
been
too
ignorant
or
too
careless
to
efface
all
the
evidences
of
christian
occupation
the
doors
of
the
eastern
gate
are
embossed
with
brass
and
among
the
emblems
is
the
christian
sacramental
cup
over
an
arch
which
can
only
be
seen
from
the
roof
of
the
silversmiths
bazaar
is
this
inscription
in
greek
kingdom
o
christ
is
an
everlasting
kingdom
and
thy
dominion
endureth
throughout
all
it
required
a
special
permit
to
admit
us
to
the
mosque
but
when
we
were
within
the
sacred
precincts
and
shod
with
slippers
lest
our
infidel
shoes
should
touch
the
pavement
we
were
followed
by
a
crowd
of
attendants
who
for
the
moment
overcame
their
repugnance
to
our
faith
in
expectation
of
our
backsheesh
the
interior
view
is
impressive
by
reason
of
the
elegant
minarets
and
the
fine
colonnaded
open
court
upon
one
of
the
minarets
jesus
will
descend
when
he
comes
to
judge
the
world
the
spacious
mosque
occupying
one
side
of
the
court
and
open
on
that
side
to
its
roof
is
divided
in
its
length
by
two
rows
of
corinthian
columns
and
has
a
certain
cheerfulness
and
hospitality
the
tesselated
marble
pavement
of
the
interior
is
much
worn
and
is
nearly
all
covered
with
carpets
of
persia
and
of
smyrna
the
only
tomb
in
the
mosque
is
that
of
john
the
baptist
which
is
draped
in
a
richly
embroidered
cloth
we
were
anew
impressed
by
the
democratic
character
of
the
great
mosques
this
opening
by
its
four
gates
into
the
busiest
bazaars
as
we
said
is
much
frequented
at
all
hours
at
the
seasons
of
prayer
you
may
see
great
numbers
prostrating
themselves
in
devotion
and
at
all
other
times
this
cool
retreat
is
a
refuge
for
the
poor
and
the
weary
the
fountains
of
running
water
in
the
court
attract
people
who
desire
only
to
sit
there
and
rest
as
well
as
those
who
wash
and
pray
about
the
fountains
and
in
the
mosque
were
seated
groups
of
women
eating
their
noonday
bread
or
resting
in
that
dumb
attitude
under
which
eastern
women
disguise
their
discontent
or
their
intrigues
this
is
at
any
rate
a
haven
of
rest
for
all
and
it
is
a
goodly
sight
to
see
all
classes
rich
and
poor
flocking
in
here
leaving
their
shoes
at
the
door
or
carrying
them
in
their
hands
the
view
from
the
minaret
which
we
ascended
is
peculiar
on
the
horizon
we
saw
the
tops
of
hills
and
mountains
snowy
hermon
among
them
far
over
the
plain
we
could
not
look
for
the
city
is
beset
by
a
thicket
of
slender
trees
which
were
just
then
in
fresh
leafage
withdrawing
our
gaze
from
the
environs
we
looked
down
upon
the
city
most
conspicuous
were
the
minarets
then
a
few
domes
and
then
thousands
of
roofs
you
see
the
top
of
a
covered
city
but
not
the
city
in
fact
it
scarcely
looks
like
a
city
you
see
no
streets
and
few
roofs
proper
for
we
have
to
look
twice
to
convince
ourselves
that
the
flat
spaces
covered
with
earth
and
often
green
with
vegetation
gardens
in
the
air
are
actually
roofs
of
houses
the
streets
are
either
roofed
over
or
are
so
narrow
that
we
can
not
see
them
from
this
height
damascus
is
a
sort
of
not
far
from
the
great
mosque
is
the
tomb
of
saladin
we
looked
from
the
street
through
a
grated
window
to
the
bars
of
which
the
faithful
have
tied
innumerable
rags
and
strings
pious
offerings
which
it
is
supposed
will
bring
them
good
luck
into
a
painted
enclosure
and
saw
a
large
catafalque
or
sarcophagus
covered
with
a
green
mantle
the
tomb
is
near
a
mosque
and
beside
a
busy
it
is
in
the
midst
of
traffic
and
travel
among
activities
and
the
full
rush
of
life
where
a
man
would
like
to
be
buried
in
order
to
be
kept
in
remembrance
in
going
about
the
streets
we
notice
the
prevalence
of
color
in
portals
in
the
interior
courts
of
houses
and
in
the
baths
there
is
a
fondness
for
decorating
with
broad
gay
stripes
of
red
yellow
and
white
even
the
white
pet
sheep
which
are
led
about
by
children
have
their
wool
stained
with
dabs
of
brilliant
color
in
honor
of
the
greek
easter
the
baths
of
damascus
are
many
and
very
good
not
so
severe
and
violent
as
those
of
new
york
nor
so
thorough
as
those
of
cairo
but
the
best
of
them
clean
and
agreeable
we
push
aside
a
gay
curtain
from
the
street
and
descend
by
steps
into
a
square
apartment
it
has
a
dome
like
a
mosque
under
the
dome
is
a
large
marble
basin
into
which
water
is
running
the
floor
is
tesselated
with
colored
marbles
each
side
is
a
recess
with
a
halfdome
and
in
the
recesses
are
elevated
divans
piled
with
cushions
for
reclining
the
walls
are
painted
in
stripes
of
blue
yellow
and
red
and
the
room
is
bright
with
various
oriental
stuffs
there
are
turbaned
and
attendants
whose
gentle
faces
might
make
them
mistaken
for
ministers
of
religion
as
well
as
of
cleanliness
and
upon
the
divans
recline
those
who
have
come
from
the
bath
enjoying
kief
with
pipes
and
coffee
there
is
an
atmosphere
of
perfect
contentment
in
the
place
and
i
can
imagine
how
an
effeminate
ruler
might
see
almost
without
a
sigh
the
empire
of
the
world
slip
from
his
grasp
while
he
surrendered
himself
to
this
delicious
influence
we
undressed
were
towelled
shod
with
wooden
clogs
and
led
through
marble
paved
passages
and
several
rooms
into
an
inner
long
chamber
which
has
a
domed
roof
pierced
by
of
glass
the
floor
of
colored
marbles
was
slippery
with
water
running
from
the
overflowing
fountains
or
dashed
about
by
the
attendants
out
of
this
room
open
several
smaller
chambers
into
which
an
unsocial
person
might
retire
we
sat
down
on
the
floor
by
a
marble
basin
into
which
both
hot
and
cold
water
poured
after
a
little
time
spent
in
contemplating
the
humidity
of
the
world
and
reflecting
on
the
equality
of
all
men
before
the
law
without
clothes
an
attendant
approached
and
began
to
deluge
us
with
buckets
of
hot
water
dashing
them
over
us
with
a
jocular
enjoyment
and
as
much
indifference
to
our
personality
as
if
we
had
been
statues
i
should
like
to
know
how
life
looks
to
a
man
who
passes
his
days
in
this
dimly
illumined
chamber
of
steam
and
is
permitted
to
treat
his
with
every
mark
of
disrespect
when
we
were
sufficiently
drenched
the
agile
arab
who
had
selected
me
as
his
mine
of
backsheesh
knelt
down
and
began
to
scrub
me
with
hair
mittens
with
a
great
show
of
energy
uttering
jocose
exclamations
in
his
own
language
and
practising
the
english
words
he
had
mastered
one
of
them
being
which
he
addressed
to
me
both
affirmatively
and
interrogatively
as
if
under
the
impression
that
it
conveyed
the
same
meaning
as
tyeb
in
his
vocabulary
i
suppose
he
had
often
heard
wicked
englishmen
who
were
under
his
hands
use
it
and
he
took
it
for
an
expression
of
profound
satisfaction
he
continued
this
operation
for
some
time
putting
me
in
a
sitting
position
turning
me
over
telling
me
to
when
he
desired
me
to
lie
down
encouraging
me
by
various
barbarous
cries
and
slapping
his
hand
from
time
to
time
to
make
up
by
noise
for
his
economical
expenditure
of
muscular
force
after
my
hilarious
bather
had
finished
this
process
he
lathered
me
thoroughly
drenched
me
from
head
to
heels
in
suds
and
then
let
me
put
the
crowning
touch
to
my
happiness
by
entering
one
of
the
little
rooms
and
sliding
into
a
tank
of
water
hot
enough
to
take
the
skin
off
it
is
easy
enough
to
make
all
this
process
read
like
a
martyrdom
but
it
is
on
the
contrary
so
delightful
that
you
do
not
wonder
that
the
ancients
spent
so
much
time
in
the
bath
and
that
next
to
the
amphitheatre
the
emperors
and
tyrants
lavished
most
money
upon
these
establishments
of
which
the
people
were
so
extravagantly
fond
fresh
towels
were
wound
round
us
turbans
were
put
on
our
heads
and
we
were
led
back
to
the
room
first
entered
where
we
were
in
cloths
and
towels
and
left
to
recline
upon
the
cushioned
divans
pipes
and
coffee
were
brought
and
we
enjoyed
a
delicious
sense
of
repose
and
bodily
lightness
looking
dimly
at
the
grave
figures
about
us
and
recognizing
in
them
not
men
but
dreamy
images
of
a
physical
paradise
no
rude
voices
or
sharp
movements
broke
the
repose
of
the
chamber
it
was
as
in
a
dream
that
i
watched
a
handsome
boy
who
with
a
long
pole
was
handling
the
washed
towels
and
admired
the
unerring
skill
that
tossed
the
strips
of
cloth
high
in
the
air
and
caused
them
to
catch
and
hang
squarely
upon
the
cords
stretched
across
the
recesses
the
mind
was
equal
to
the
observation
but
not
to
the
comprehension
of
this
feat
when
we
were
sufficiently
cooled
we
were
assisted
to
dress
the
various
articles
of
frank
apparel
affording
great
amusement
to
the
orientals
the
charge
for
the
whole
entertainment
was
two
francs
each
probably
about
four
times
what
a
native
would
have
paid
sights
in
damascus
day
after
day
we
continued
like
the
mourners
to
go
about
the
streets
in
the
tangle
of
the
bazaars
under
the
dark
roofs
endeavoring
to
see
damascus
when
we
emerged
from
the
city
gate
the
view
was
not
much
less
limited
i
made
the
circuit
of
the
wall
on
the
north
in
lanes
by
running
streams
canals
enclosed
gardens
seeing
everywhere
hundreds
of
patient
men
and
women
squatting
on
the
brink
of
every
rivulet
by
every
damp
spot
in
idle
and
perfect
repose
we
stumbled
about
also
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
and
saw
the
reputed
place
of
paul
escape
which
has
been
lately
changed
it
is
a
ruined
saracenic
tower
in
the
wall
under
which
is
bab
kisan
a
gate
that
has
been
walled
up
for
seven
hundred
years
the
window
does
not
any
more
exist
from
which
the
apostle
was
let
down
in
a
basket
but
it
used
to
be
pointed
out
with
confidence
and
i
am
told
that
the
basket
is
still
shown
but
we
did
not
see
it
there
are
still
some
houses
on
this
south
wall
and
a
few
of
them
have
projecting
windows
from
which
a
person
might
easily
be
lowered
it
was
in
such
a
house
that
the
harlot
of
jericho
lived
who
contrived
the
escape
of
the
spies
of
joshua
and
we
see
how
thick
and
substantial
the
town
walls
of
that
city
must
have
been
to
support
human
habitations
but
they
were
blown
down
turning
southward
into
the
country
we
came
to
the
tomb
of
the
porter
who
assisted
paul
escape
and
who
now
sleeps
here
under
the
weight
of
the
sobriquet
of
george
a
little
farther
out
on
the
same
road
is
located
the
spot
of
said
conversion
near
it
is
the
english
cemetery
a
small
enclosure
containing
a
domed
building
surmounted
by
a
cross
and
in
this
historical
spot
whose
mutations
of
race
religion
and
government
would
forbid
the
most
superficial
to
construct
for
it
any
scheme
of
growth
or
decay
amid
these
almost
melancholy
patches
of
vegetation
which
still
hover
in
the
oriental
imagination
as
the
gardens
of
all
delights
sleeps
undisturbed
by
ambition
or
by
criticism
having
at
last
let
us
hope
solved
the
theory
of
the
brilliant
henry
buckle
not
far
off
is
the
christian
cemetery
is
buried
here
i
asked
our
guide
anybody
he
replied
cheerfully
french
italians
anybody
you
as
if
i
could
please
myself
by
interring
here
any
one
i
chose
among
the
graves
was
a
group
of
women
hair
dishevelled
and
garments
loosened
in
the
abandon
of
mourning
seated
about
a
rough
coffin
open
its
entire
length
in
it
lay
the
body
of
a
young
man
who
had
been
drowned
and
recovered
from
the
water
after
three
days
the
women
lifted
up
his
dead
hands
let
them
drop
heavily
and
then
wailed
and
howled
throwing
themselves
into
attitudes
of
the
most
passionate
grief
it
was
a
piteous
sight
there
under
the
open
sky
in
the
presence
of
an
unsympathizing
crowd
of
spectators
returning
we
went
round
by
the
large
moslem
cemetery
situated
at
the
southwest
corner
of
the
city
it
is
like
all
moslem
a
melancholy
spectacle
mass
of
small
whitewashed
mounds
of
mud
or
brick
with
an
inscribed
headstone
here
rest
some
of
the
most
famous
men
and
women
of
moslem
history
here
is
the
grave
of
asâker
the
historian
of
damascus
here
rests
the
fierce
moawyeh
the
founder
of
the
dynasty
of
the
omeiyades
and
here
are
buried
three
of
the
wives
of
mohammed
and
fatimeh
his
granddaughter
the
child
of
ali
whose
place
of
sepulture
no
man
knows
upon
nearly
every
tomb
is
a
hollow
for
water
and
in
it
is
a
sprig
of
myrtle
which
is
renewed
every
friday
by
the
women
who
come
here
to
mourn
and
to
gossip
much
of
the
traveller
time
and
perhaps
the
most
enjoyable
part
of
it
in
damascus
is
spent
in
the
bazaars
cheapening
scarfs
and
rugs
and
the
various
silken
products
of
syrian
and
persian
looms
picking
over
dishes
of
antique
coins
taking
impressions
of
intaglios
hunting
for
curious
amulets
and
searching
for
the
quaintest
and
most
brilliant
saracenic
tiles
the
quest
of
the
antique
is
always
exciting
and
the
inexperienced
is
ever
hopeful
that
he
will
find
a
gem
of
value
in
a
heap
of
rubbish
this
hope
never
abandons
the
most
blase
tourist
though
in
time
he
comes
to
understand
that
the
jew
or
the
oily
armenian
or
the
respectable
turk
who
spreads
his
delusive
wares
before
him
knows
quite
as
well
as
the
seeker
the
value
of
any
bit
of
antiquity
not
only
in
damascus
but
in
constantinople
paris
and
london
and
is
an
adept
in
all
the
counterfeits
and
impositions
of
the
orient
the
bazaars
of
the
antique
of
old
armor
ancient
brasses
and
of
curiosities
generally
and
even
of
the
silver
and
gold
smiths
are
disappointing
after
cairo
they
are
generally
full
of
rubbish
from
which
the
choice
things
seem
to
have
been
culled
indeed
the
rage
for
antiquities
is
now
so
great
that
sharp
buyers
from
europe
range
all
the
orient
and
leave
little
for
the
innocent
and
hopeful
tourist
who
is
aghast
at
the
prices
demanded
and
usually
finds
himself
a
victim
of
his
own
cleverness
when
he
pays
for
any
article
only
a
fourth
of
the
price
at
first
asked
the
silk
bazaars
of
damascus
still
preserve
however
a
sort
of
of
opportunity
although
they
are
largely
supplied
by
the
fabrics
manufactured
at
beyrout
and
in
other
syrian
towns
certainly
no
place
is
more
tempting
than
one
of
the
silk
khans
old
courts
in
the
galleries
of
which
you
find
little
apartments
stuffed
full
of
the
seductions
of
eastern
looms
for
myself
i
confess
to
the
fascination
of
those
stuffs
of
brilliant
dyes
shot
with
threads
of
gold
and
of
silver
i
know
a
tall
armenian
who
has
a
little
chamber
full
of
shelves
from
which
he
takes
down
one
rich
scarf
after
another
unfolds
it
shakes
out
its
shining
hues
and
throws
it
on
the
heap
until
the
room
is
littered
with
gorgeous
stuffs
he
himself
is
clad
in
silk
attire
he
is
tall
suave
insinuating
grave
and
overwhelmingly
condescending
i
can
see
him
now
when
i
question
the
value
put
upon
a
certain
article
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
and
no
doubt
betray
my
admiration
of
in
my
eyes
can
see
him
now
throw
back
his
head
half
close
his
eastern
eyes
and
exclaim
as
if
he
had
hot
pudding
in
his
mouth
is
ther
larster
i
can
see
now
when
we
had
made
up
a
package
of
scarfs
and
offered
a
certain
sum
for
the
lot
which
the
sleek
and
polite
trader
refused
with
his
eternal
is
ther
larster
price
sling
the
articles
about
the
room
and
depart
in
rage
and
i
can
see
the
armenian
bow
us
into
the
corridor
with
the
same
sweet
courtesy
knowing
very
well
that
the
trade
is
only
just
begun
that
it
is
in
fact
under
good
headway
that
the
arab
will
return
that
he
will
yield
a
little
from
the
price
and
that
we
shall
go
away
loaded
with
his
wares
leaving
him
ruined
by
the
transaction
but
proud
to
be
our
friend
our
experience
in
purchasing
old
saracenic
and
persian
tiles
is
perhaps
worth
relating
as
an
illustration
of
the
character
of
the
traders
of
damascus
tiles
were
plenty
enough
for
several
ancient
houses
had
recently
been
torn
down
and
the
dealers
continually
acquire
them
from
ruined
mosques
or
those
that
are
undergoing
repairs
the
dragoman
found
several
lots
in
private
houses
and
made
a
bargain
for
a
certain
number
at
two
francs
and
a
half
each
and
when
the
bargain
was
made
i
spent
half
a
day
in
selecting
the
specimens
we
desired
the
next
morning
before
breakfast
we
went
to
make
sure
that
the
lots
we
had
bought
would
be
at
once
packed
and
shipped
but
a
change
had
taken
place
in
twelve
hours
there
was
an
englishman
in
town
who
was
also
buying
tiles
this
produced
a
fever
in
the
market
an
impression
went
abroad
that
there
was
a
fortune
to
be
made
in
tiles
and
we
found
that
our
bargain
was
entirely
ignored
the
owners
supposed
that
the
tiles
we
had
selected
must
have
some
special
value
and
they
demanded
for
the
which
we
had
to
pay
for
them
two
francs
and
a
half
pounds
in
the
house
where
we
had
laid
aside
others
at
the
same
price
not
a
tile
was
to
be
discovered
the
old
woman
who
showed
us
the
vacant
chamber
said
she
knew
not
what
had
become
of
them
but
she
believed
they
had
been
sold
to
an
englishman
we
returned
to
the
house
first
mentioned
resolved
to
devote
the
day
if
necessary
to
the
extraction
of
the
desired
tiles
from
the
grip
of
their
owners
the
contest
began
about
eight
in
the
morning
it
was
not
finished
till
three
in
the
afternoon
and
it
was
maintained
on
our
side
with
some
disadvantage
the
only
nutriment
that
sustained
us
being
a
cup
of
tea
which
we
drank
very
early
in
the
morning
the
scene
of
the
bargain
was
the
paved
court
of
the
house
in
which
there
was
a
fountain
and
a
and
some
trained
on
espaliers
along
the
walls
the
tempting
enamelled
tiles
were
piled
up
at
one
side
of
the
court
and
spread
out
in
rows
in
the
lewân
open
recess
where
guests
are
usually
received
the
owners
were
two
greeks
polite
cunning
sharp
the
one
inflexible
the
other
yielding
combination
against
which
it
is
almost
impossible
to
trade
with
safety
for
the
yielding
one
constantly
allures
you
into
the
grip
of
the
inflexible
the
women
of
the
establishment
comely
greeks
clattered
about
the
court
on
their
high
wooden
pattens
for
a
time
and
at
length
settled
down
in
an
adjoining
apartment
to
their
regular
work
of
embroidering
silken
purses
and
taking
time
however
for
an
occasional
cigarette
or
a
pull
at
a
narghileh
and
in
a
constant
chatter
keeping
a
lively
eye
upon
the
trade
going
on
in
the
court
the
handsome
children
added
not
a
little
to
the
liveliness
of
the
scene
and
their
pranks
served
to
soften
the
asperities
of
the
encounter
although
i
could
not
discover
after
repeated
experiments
that
any
affection
lavished
upon
the
children
lowered
the
price
of
the
tiles
the
greek
does
not
let
sentiment
interfere
with
business
and
he
is
much
more
difficult
to
deal
with
than
an
arab
who
occasionally
has
impulses
each
tile
was
the
subject
of
a
separate
bargain
and
conflict
the
dicker
went
on
in
arabic
greek
broken
english
and
dislocated
french
and
was
participated
in
not
only
by
the
parties
most
concerned
but
by
the
young
greek
guide
and
by
the
exhibited
all
the
qualities
of
his
generalship
he
was
humorous
engaging
astonished
indignant
serious
playful
threatening
indifferent
beaten
on
one
grouping
of
specimens
he
made
instantly
a
new
combination
more
than
once
the
transaction
was
abruptly
broken
off
in
mutual
rage
obstinacy
and
recriminations
and
it
was
set
going
again
by
a
timely
jocularity
or
a
seeming
concession
i
can
see
now
the
soft
greek
take
up
a
tile
which
had
painted
on
it
some
quaint
figure
or
some
lovely
flower
dip
it
in
the
fountain
to
bring
out
its
brilliant
color
and
then
put
it
in
the
sun
for
our
admiration
and
i
can
see
the
dragoman
shake
his
head
in
slow
depreciation
and
push
it
one
side
when
that
tile
was
the
one
we
had
resolved
to
possess
of
all
others
and
was
the
undeclared
centre
of
contest
in
all
the
combinations
for
an
hour
thereafter
when
the
day
was
two
thirds
spent
we
had
purchased
one
hundred
tiles
jealously
watched
the
packing
of
each
one
and
seen
the
boxes
nailed
and
corded
we
could
not
have
been
more
exhausted
if
we
had
undergone
an
examination
for
a
doctorate
of
law
in
a
german
university
two
boxes
weighing
two
hundred
pounds
each
were
hoisted
upon
the
backs
of
mules
and
sent
to
the
french
company
station
there
does
not
appear
to
be
a
dray
or
a
in
damascus
all
freight
is
carried
upon
the
back
of
a
mule
or
a
horse
even
long
logs
and
whole
trunks
of
trees
when
this
transaction
was
finished
our
greek
guide
who
had
heard
me
ask
the
master
of
the
house
for
brass
trays
told
me
that
a
fellow
whom
i
had
noticed
hanging
about
there
all
the
morning
had
some
trays
to
show
me
in
fact
he
had
at
his
house
i
thought
this
a
rich
find
for
the
beautiful
antique
brasses
of
persia
are
becoming
rare
even
in
damascus
and
tired
as
we
were
we
rode
across
the
city
for
a
mile
to
a
secluded
private
house
and
were
shown
into
an
upper
chamber
what
was
our
surprise
to
find
spread
out
there
the
same
tiles
that
we
had
purchased
the
day
before
and
which
had
been
whisked
away
from
us
by
tray
the
guide
meant
we
told
the
honest
owner
that
he
was
too
late
we
had
already
tiles
enough
to
cover
his
tomb
private
houses
the
private
houses
of
damascus
are
a
theme
of
wonder
and
admiration
throughout
the
orient
in
a
land
in
which
a
moist
spot
is
called
a
garden
and
a
canal
bordered
by
willows
a
paradise
the
fancy
constructs
a
palace
of
the
utmost
splendor
and
luxury
out
of
materials
which
in
a
less
glowing
country
would
scarcely
satisfy
moderate
notions
of
comfort
or
of
ostentation
but
the
east
is
a
region
of
contrasts
as
well
as
of
luxury
and
it
is
difficult
to
say
how
much
of
their
reputation
the
celebrated
mansions
of
damascus
owe
to
the
wretchedness
of
the
ordinary
dwellings
and
also
to
the
raggedness
of
their
surroundings
we
spent
a
day
in
visiting
several
of
the
richest
dwellings
and
steeping
ourselves
in
the
dazzling
luxury
they
offer
the
exterior
of
a
private
house
gives
no
idea
of
its
interior
sometimes
its
plain
has
a
solid
handsome
and
if
it
is
very
old
perhaps
a
rich
saracenic
portal
but
usually
you
slip
from
the
gutter
lined
with
called
a
street
into
an
alley
crooked
probably
dirty
pass
through
a
and
enter
a
small
court
which
may
be
cheered
by
a
tree
and
a
basin
of
water
thence
you
wind
through
a
narrow
passage
into
a
large
court
a
parallelogram
of
tesselated
marble
having
a
fountain
in
the
centre
and
about
it
orange
and
lemon
trees
and
roses
and
vines
the
house
two
stories
high
is
built
about
this
court
upon
which
all
the
rooms
open
without
communicating
with
each
other
perhaps
the
building
is
of
marble
and
carved
or
it
may
be
highly
ornamented
with
stucco
and
painted
in
gay
colors
if
the
establishment
belongs
to
a
moslem
it
will
have
beyond
this
court
a
second
larger
and
finer
with
more
fountains
trees
and
flowers
and
a
house
more
highly
decorated
this
is
the
harem
and
the
way
to
it
is
a
crooked
alley
so
that
by
no
chance
can
the
slaves
or
visitors
of
the
master
get
a
glimpse
into
the
apartments
of
the
women
the
first
house
we
visited
was
of
this
kind
all
the
portion
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
were
admitted
into
was
in
a
state
of
shabby
decay
its
court
in
disrepair
its
rooms
void
of
comfort
condition
of
things
to
which
we
had
become
well
accustomed
in
everything
moslem
but
the
ladies
found
the
court
of
the
harem
beautiful
and
its
apartments
old
and
very
rich
in
and
in
arabesques
something
like
the
best
old
saracenic
houses
in
cairo
the
houses
of
the
rich
jews
which
we
saw
are
built
like
those
of
the
moslems
about
a
paved
court
with
a
fountain
but
totally
different
in
architecture
and
decoration
in
speaking
of
a
fountain
in
or
about
damascus
i
always
mean
a
basin
into
which
water
is
discharged
from
a
spout
if
there
are
any
jets
or
upspringing
fountains
i
was
not
so
fortunate
as
to
see
them
in
passing
through
the
streets
of
the
jews
quarter
we
encountered
at
every
step
beautiful
children
not
always
clean
children
but
ravishingly
lovely
the
handsomest
as
to
exquisite
complexions
grace
of
features
and
beauty
of
eyes
that
i
have
ever
seen
and
looking
out
from
the
open
windows
of
the
balconies
which
hang
over
the
street
were
lovely
jewish
women
the
mothers
of
the
beautiful
children
and
the
maidens
to
whom
the
humble
christian
is
grateful
that
they
tire
themselves
and
look
out
of
windows
now
as
they
did
in
the
days
of
the
prophets
at
the
first
jewish
house
we
entered
we
were
received
by
the
entire
family
old
and
young
newly
married
betrothed
cousins
uncles
and
maiden
aunts
they
were
evidently
expecting
company
about
these
days
and
not
at
all
averse
to
exhibiting
their
gorgeous
house
and
their
rich
apparel
three
dumpy
women
who
would
pass
for
ugly
anywhere
welcomed
us
at
first
in
the
raised
recess
or
lewân
at
one
end
of
the
court
we
were
seated
upon
the
divans
while
the
women
squatted
upon
cushions
then
the
rest
of
the
family
began
to
appear
there
were
the
handsome
owner
of
the
house
his
younger
brother
just
married
and
the
wife
of
the
latter
a
tall
and
pretty
woman
of
the
strictly
order
of
beauty
with
large
swimming
eyes
she
wore
a
gown
of
blue
silk
and
diamonds
and
strange
to
say
a
dark
wig
it
is
the
fashion
at
marriage
to
shave
the
head
and
put
on
a
wig
a
most
disenchanting
performance
for
a
bride
the
numerous
children
very
pretty
and
came
forward
and
kissed
our
hands
the
little
girls
were
attired
in
white
dresses
and
all
except
the
very
smallest
wore
diamonds
one
was
a
bride
of
twelve
years
whose
marriage
was
to
be
concluded
the
next
year
she
wore
an
her
high
corsage
of
white
silk
sparkled
with
diamonds
and
she
was
sweet
and
engaging
in
manner
and
spoke
french
prettily
the
girls
evidently
had
on
the
family
diamonds
and
i
could
imagine
that
the
bazaar
of
moses
in
the
city
had
been
stripped
to
make
a
holiday
for
his
daughters
surely
we
never
saw
such
a
display
out
of
the
the
of
one
of
the
cousins
of
the
family
who
was
recently
married
was
a
pretty
hat
the
coronal
front
of
which
was
a
mass
of
diamonds
we
saw
this
same
style
of
dress
in
other
houses
afterwards
and
were
permitted
to
admire
other
young
women
who
were
literally
plastered
with
these
precious
stones
in
wreaths
on
the
head
in
brooches
and
necklaces
of
dazzling
diamonds
which
after
a
time
came
to
have
no
more
value
in
our
eyes
than
glass
so
common
and
cheap
did
they
seem
if
a
wicked
person
could
persuade
one
of
these
dazzling
creatures
to
elope
with
him
he
would
be
in
possession
of
treasure
enough
to
found
a
college
for
the
conversion
of
the
jews
i
could
not
but
be
struck
with
the
resemblance
of
one
of
the
plump
young
girls
who
was
set
before
us
for
worship
clad
in
white
silk
and
inestimable
jewels
to
the
images
of
the
madonna
decked
with
equal
affection
and
lavish
wealth
which
one
sees
in
the
italian
churches
all
the
women
and
children
of
the
family
walked
about
upon
wooden
pattens
ingeniously
inlaid
with
ivory
or
pearl
the
two
supports
of
which
raise
them
about
three
inches
from
the
ground
they
are
confined
to
the
foot
by
a
strap
across
the
ball
but
being
otherwise
loose
they
clatter
at
every
step
of
course
graceful
walking
on
these
little
stilts
is
impossible
and
the
women
go
about
like
hens
whose
toes
have
been
frozen
off
when
they
step
up
into
the
lewân
they
leave
their
pattens
on
the
marble
floor
and
sit
in
their
our
conversation
with
this
hospitable
collection
of
relations
consisted
chiefly
in
inquiries
about
their
connection
with
each
other
and
an
effort
on
their
part
to
understand
our
relationship
and
to
know
why
we
had
not
brought
our
entire
families
they
were
also
extremely
curious
to
know
about
our
houses
in
america
chiefly
it
would
seem
to
enforce
the
contrast
between
our
plainness
and
their
luxury
when
we
had
been
served
with
coffee
and
cigarettes
they
all
rose
and
showed
us
about
the
apartments
the
first
one
the
salon
will
give
an
idea
of
the
others
it
was
a
lofty
but
not
large
room
with
a
highly
painted
ceiling
and
consisted
of
two
parts
the
first
level
with
the
court
and
paved
with
marble
had
a
marble
basin
in
the
centre
supported
on
carved
lions
the
other
two
thirds
of
the
apartment
was
raised
about
a
foot
carpeted
and
furnished
with
chairs
of
wood
inlaid
with
stiffly
set
against
the
walls
the
chairs
were
not
comfortable
to
sit
in
and
they
were
the
sole
furniture
the
wainscoting
was
of
marble
in
and
most
elaborately
carved
high
up
near
the
ceiling
were
windows
double
windows
in
fact
with
a
space
between
like
a
gallery
so
that
the
lacelike
was
exhibited
to
the
utmost
advantage
there
was
much
gilding
and
color
on
the
marble
and
the
whole
was
costly
and
gaudy
the
in
the
second
story
were
also
handsome
in
this
style
but
they
were
literally
all
windows
on
all
sides
the
space
between
the
windows
was
never
more
than
three
or
four
inches
they
are
admirable
for
light
and
air
but
to
enter
them
is
almost
like
stepping
out
of
doors
they
are
all
en
suite
so
that
it
would
seem
that
the
family
must
retire
simultaneously
exchanging
the
comparative
privacy
of
the
isolated
rooms
below
for
the
community
of
these
glass
apartments
the
salons
that
we
saw
in
other
houses
were
of
the
same
general
style
of
the
first
some
had
marble
niches
in
the
walls
the
arch
of
which
was
supported
by
slender
marble
columns
and
these
recesses
as
well
as
the
walls
were
decorated
with
painting
usually
landscapes
and
cities
the
painting
gives
you
a
perfectly
accurate
idea
of
the
condition
of
art
in
the
orient
it
was
not
only
it
was
worse
than
byzantine
and
not
so
good
as
chinese
money
had
been
freely
lavished
in
these
dwellings
and
whatever
the
eastern
chisel
or
brush
could
do
to
enrich
and
ornament
them
had
been
done
i
was
much
pleased
by
the
picture
of
a
city
may
have
been
done
upon
the
wall
the
artist
had
dotted
the
plaster
with
such
houses
as
children
are
accustomed
to
make
on
a
slate
arranging
some
of
them
in
rows
and
inserting
here
and
there
a
minaret
and
a
dome
there
was
not
the
slightest
attempt
at
shading
or
perspective
yet
the
owners
contemplated
the
result
with
visible
satisfaction
and
took
a
simple
and
undisguised
pleasure
in
our
admiration
of
the
work
of
art
i
said
to
the
delighted
jew
connoisseur
who
had
paid
for
this
picture
have
nothing
like
that
in
our
houses
in
america
not
even
in
the
capitol
at
washington
your
country
is
new
he
replied
with
amiable
consideration
will
have
of
it
one
in
none
of
these
veneered
and
stuccoed
palaces
did
we
find
any
comfort
everywhere
a
profuse
expenditure
of
money
in
italian
marble
in
carving
in
gilding
and
glaring
color
but
no
taste
except
in
some
of
the
cut
in
arabesque
and
reminiscence
of
the
almost
extinct
saracenic
grace
and
invention
and
the
construction
of
all
the
buildings
and
the
ornamentation
were
shabby
and
cheap
in
appearance
in
spite
of
the
rich
materials
the
marbles
in
the
pavement
or
the
walls
were
badly
joined
and
raggedly
cemented
and
by
the
side
of
the
most
costly
work
was
sure
to
be
something
mean
and
frail
we
supposed
at
first
that
we
ought
to
feel
a
little
delicacy
about
intruding
our
curiosity
into
private
houses
an
unpardonable
feeling
in
a
traveller
who
has
been
long
enough
in
the
orient
to
lose
the
bloom
of
occidental
modesty
but
we
need
not
have
feared
our
hosts
were
only
too
glad
that
we
should
see
their
state
and
luxury
there
was
something
almost
comical
in
these
jewish
women
arraying
themselves
in
their
finest
gowns
and
loading
themselves
with
diamonds
so
early
in
the
day
for
they
were
ready
to
receive
us
at
ten
and
in
their
naïve
enjoyment
of
our
admiration
surely
we
ought
not
to
have
thought
that
comical
which
was
so
kindly
intended
i
could
not
but
wonder
however
what
resource
for
the
rest
of
the
day
could
remain
to
a
woman
who
had
begun
it
by
dressing
in
all
her
ornaments
by
crowning
herself
with
coronets
and
sprays
of
diamonds
by
hanging
her
neck
and
arms
with
glittering
gems
as
if
she
had
been
a
statue
set
up
for
idolatry
after
this
supreme
effort
of
the
sex
the
remainder
of
the
day
must
be
intolerably
flat
for
i
think
one
of
the
pleasures
of
life
must
be
the
gradual
transformation
the
blooming
from
the
chrysalis
of
elegant
morning
déshabille
into
the
perfect
flower
of
the
evening
toilet
these
princesses
of
turkish
diamonds
all
wore
dresses
with
the
classic
short
waist
which
is
the
most
womanly
and
becoming
and
perhaps
their
apparel
imparted
a
graciousness
to
their
manner
we
were
everywhere
cordially
received
and
usually
offered
coffee
or
sherbet
and
confections
the
emir
lives
in
a
house
suitable
to
a
wealthy
moslem
who
has
a
harem
the
old
chieftain
had
expressed
his
willingness
to
receive
us
and
meshaka
the
american
consular
agent
sent
his
kawass
to
accompany
us
to
his
residence
at
the
appointed
hour
the
old
gentleman
met
us
at
the
door
of
his
which
is
at
one
end
of
the
fountained
court
he
wore
the
plain
arab
costume
with
a
white
turban
i
had
heard
so
much
of
the
striking
venerable
and
even
magnificent
appearance
of
this
formidable
desert
hero
that
i
experienced
a
little
disappointment
in
the
reality
and
learned
anew
that
the
hero
should
be
seen
in
action
or
through
the
lenses
of
imaginative
description
which
can
clothe
the
body
with
all
the
attributes
of
the
soul
the
demigods
so
seldom
come
up
to
their
reputation
may
have
appeared
a
gigantic
man
when
on
horseback
in
the
smoke
and
whirl
of
an
algerine
combat
but
he
is
a
man
of
medium
size
and
scarcely
medium
height
his
head
if
not
large
is
finely
shaped
and
intellectual
and
his
face
is
open
and
pleasing
he
wore
a
beard
trimmed
which
i
suspect
ought
to
be
white
but
which
was
black
and
i
fear
dyed
you
would
judge
him
to
be
at
least
and
his
age
begins
to
show
by
a
little
pallor
by
a
visible
want
of
bodily
force
and
by
a
lack
of
lustre
in
those
once
fiery
and
untamable
eyes
his
manner
was
very
gracious
and
had
a
simple
dignity
nor
did
our
interview
mainly
consist
in
the
usual
strained
compliments
of
such
occasions
in
reply
to
a
question
he
said
that
he
had
lived
over
twenty
years
in
damascus
but
it
was
evident
that
his
long
exile
had
not
dulled
his
interest
in
the
progress
of
the
world
and
that
he
watched
with
intense
feeling
all
movements
of
peoples
in
the
direction
of
freedom
there
is
no
such
teacher
of
democracy
as
misfortune
but
i
fancy
that
sincerely
desires
for
others
the
liberty
he
covets
for
himself
he
certainly
has
the
courage
of
his
opinions
while
he
is
a
very
strict
moslem
he
is
neither
bigoted
nor
intolerant
as
he
showed
by
his
conduct
during
the
massacre
of
the
christians
here
in
his
face
lighted
up
with
pleasure
when
i
told
him
that
americans
remembered
with
much
gratitude
his
interference
in
behalf
of
the
christians
at
that
time
the
talk
drifting
to
the
state
of
france
and
italy
he
expressed
his
full
sympathy
with
the
liberal
movement
of
the
italian
government
but
as
to
france
he
had
no
hope
of
a
republic
at
present
he
did
not
think
the
people
capable
of
it
america
he
said
with
sudden
enthusiasm
is
the
country
in
all
the
world
that
is
the
only
country
that
is
the
land
of
real
freedom
i
hope
he
added
you
will
have
no
more
trouble
among
we
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
the
probability
of
another
outburst
of
the
druses
which
was
getting
to
be
so
loudly
whispered
nobody
he
said
could
tell
what
the
druses
were
thinking
or
doing
he
had
no
doubt
that
in
the
former
rising
and
massacre
they
were
abetted
by
the
turkish
government
this
led
him
to
speak
of
the
condition
of
syria
the
people
were
fearfully
ground
down
and
oppressed
with
taxation
and
exactions
of
all
sorts
in
comparison
he
did
not
think
egypt
was
any
better
off
but
much
the
same
in
all
our
conversation
we
were
greatly
impressed
by
the
calm
and
comprehensive
views
of
the
old
hero
his
philosophical
temper
and
his
serenity
although
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
chafed
under
the
banishment
which
kept
so
eager
a
soul
from
participation
in
the
great
movements
which
he
weighed
so
well
and
so
longed
to
aid
when
refreshments
had
been
served
we
took
our
leave
but
the
emir
insisted
upon
accompanying
us
through
the
court
and
the
dirty
alleys
even
to
the
public
street
where
our
donkeys
awaited
us
and
bade
us
farewell
with
a
profusion
of
oriental
salutations
specimen
travellers
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
some
one
has
not
the
leisure
and
the
genius
for
it
would
require
study
and
to
sketch
the
more
peculiar
of
the
travellers
who
journey
during
a
season
in
the
orient
to
photograph
their
impressions
and
to
unravel
the
motives
that
have
set
them
wandering
there
was
at
our
hotel
a
countryman
whose
observations
on
the
east
pleased
me
mightily
i
inferred
correctly
from
his
slow
and
deliberate
manner
of
speech
that
he
was
from
the
great
west
a
gentleman
spare
in
figure
and
sallow
in
complexion
you
might
have
mistaken
him
for
a
from
tennessee
or
illinois
what
you
specially
admired
in
him
was
his
entire
sincerity
and
his
imperviousness
to
all
the
glamour
historical
or
romantic
which
interested
parties
like
poets
and
historians
have
sought
to
throw
over
the
orient
a
heap
of
refuse
in
the
street
or
an
improvident
dependant
on
allah
in
rags
was
just
as
offensive
to
him
in
damascus
as
it
would
be
in
big
lickopolis
he
carried
his
scales
with
him
he
put
into
one
balance
his
and
into
the
other
the
entire
eastern
civilization
and
the
orient
kicked
the
beam
it
was
with
a
mighty
though
secret
joy
that
you
saw
it
it
was
not
indeed
for
his
own
pleasure
that
he
had
left
the
familiar
cronies
of
his
own
town
and
come
into
foreign
and
uncomfortable
parts
you
could
see
that
he
would
much
prefer
to
be
again
among
the
and
and
operators
exchanging
the
dry
chips
of
gossip
about
stocks
and
rates
but
being
a
man
of
he
had
yielded
to
the
imperious
pressure
of
our
modern
society
which
insists
on
travel
and
to
the
natural
desire
of
his
family
to
see
the
world
europe
had
not
pleased
him
although
it
was
interesting
for
an
old
country
and
there
were
a
few
places
the
grand
hotel
in
paris
for
instance
where
one
feels
a
little
at
home
buildings
cathedrals
yes
some
of
them
were
very
fine
but
there
was
nothing
in
europe
to
equal
or
approach
the
capitol
in
washington
and
galleries
my
wife
likes
them
and
my
daughter
suppose
i
have
walked
through
miles
and
miles
of
them
it
may
have
been
in
the
nature
of
a
confidential
confession
that
he
was
dragged
into
the
east
though
he
made
no
concealment
of
his
repugnance
to
being
here
but
when
he
had
crossed
the
mediterranean
europe
had
attractions
for
him
which
he
had
never
imagined
while
he
was
in
it
if
he
had
been
left
to
himself
he
would
have
fled
back
from
cairo
as
if
it
were
infested
with
plague
he
had
gone
no
farther
up
the
nile
that
miserable
hole
cairo
was
sufficient
for
him
talk
he
was
saying
speaking
with
that
deliberate
pause
and
emphasis
upon
every
word
which
characterizes
the
conversation
of
his
section
of
the
country
talk
about
the
climate
of
egypt
it
is
all
a
humbug
cairo
is
the
most
disagreeable
city
in
the
world
no
sun
nothing
but
dust
and
wind
i
give
you
my
word
that
we
had
only
one
pleasant
day
in
a
week
cold
ca
get
warm
in
the
hotel
the
only
decent
day
we
had
in
egypt
was
at
suez
fruit
what
do
you
get
some
pretend
to
like
those
dry
dates
the
oranges
are
so
sour
you
ca
eat
them
except
the
jaffa
which
are
all
peel
yes
the
pyramids
are
big
piles
of
stone
but
when
you
come
to
architecture
what
is
there
in
cairo
to
compare
to
the
tuileries
the
mosque
of
mohammed
ali
is
a
fine
building
it
suits
me
better
than
the
mosque
at
jerusalem
but
what
a
city
to
live
in
the
farther
our
friend
journeyed
in
the
orient
the
deeper
became
his
disgust
it
was
extreme
in
jerusalem
but
it
had
a
pathetic
tone
of
resignation
in
damascus
hope
was
dead
within
him
the
day
after
we
had
visited
the
private
houses
some
one
asked
him
at
table
if
he
was
not
pleased
with
damascus
he
repeated
is
the
most
place
i
have
ever
been
in
there
is
nothing
to
eat
and
nothing
to
see
i
had
heard
about
the
bazaars
of
damascus
my
daughter
must
see
the
bazaars
of
damascus
there
is
nothing
in
them
i
have
been
from
one
end
of
them
to
the
other
is
a
mess
of
rubbish
i
suppose
you
were
hauled
through
what
they
call
the
private
houses
there
is
a
good
deal
of
marble
and
a
good
deal
of
show
but
there
is
a
house
in
damascus
that
a
respectable
american
would
live
in
there
is
one
he
could
be
comfortable
in
the
old
mosque
is
an
interesting
place
i
like
the
mosque
and
i
have
been
there
a
couple
of
times
and
should
mind
going
again
but
i
had
enough
of
damascus
i
do
intend
to
go
out
doors
again
until
my
family
are
ready
to
all
these
intense
dislikes
of
the
western
observer
were
warmly
combated
by
the
ladies
present
who
found
damascus
almost
a
paradise
and
were
glowing
with
enthusiasm
over
every
place
and
incident
of
their
journey
having
delivered
his
opinion
our
friend
let
the
conversation
run
on
without
interference
as
it
ranged
all
over
palestine
he
sat
in
silence
as
if
he
were
patiently
enduring
anew
the
martyrdom
of
his
until
at
length
obeying
a
seeming
necessity
of
relieving
his
feelings
he
leaned
forward
and
addressed
the
lady
next
but
one
to
him
measuring
every
word
with
judicial
slowness
it
is
always
refreshing
in
travel
to
meet
a
candid
man
who
is
not
hindered
by
any
weight
of
historic
consciousness
from
expressing
his
opinions
and
without
exactly
knowing
why
i
felt
under
great
obligations
to
this
gentleman
gentleman
he
certainly
was
even
to
an
courtesy
that
shamed
the
best
breeding
of
the
arabs
and
after
this
wholesale
sweep
of
the
oriental
board
i
experienced
a
new
pleasure
in
going
about
and
picking
up
the
fragments
of
romance
and
sentiment
that
one
might
still
admire
there
was
another
pilgrim
at
damascus
to
whom
palestine
was
larger
than
all
the
world
besides
and
who
magnified
its
relation
to
the
rest
of
the
earth
as
much
as
our
more
widely
travelled
friend
belittled
it
in
a
waste
but
damp
spot
outside
the
an
incongruous
party
had
pitched
its
tents
camp
which
swarmed
during
the
day
with
itinerant
merchants
and
beggars
and
at
night
was
the
favorite
resort
of
the
most
dissolute
dogs
of
damascus
in
knowing
this
party
one
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
various
motives
that
bring
people
to
the
holy
land
there
were
a
divinity
student
a
college
professor
a
publisher
some
indomitable
english
ladies
some
london
cockneys
and
a
group
of
young
men
who
made
a
lark
of
the
pilgrimage
and
saw
no
more
significance
in
the
tour
than
in
a
jaunt
to
the
derby
or
a
sail
to
margate
i
was
told
that
the
most
read
and
disputed
over
by
this
party
was
the
graphic
itinerary
of
mark
twain
the
pilgrim
to
whom
i
refer
however
scarcely
needed
any
guide
in
the
holy
land
he
was
by
his
own
representation
an
illiterate
shoemaker
from
the
south
of
england
of
schooling
he
had
never
enjoyed
a
day
nor
of
education
except
such
as
sprung
from
his
which
happened
in
his
twentieth
year
at
that
age
he
joined
the
methodists
and
became
without
abandoning
his
bench
an
occasional
exhorter
and
his
study
to
which
he
gave
every
moment
not
demanded
by
his
trade
was
the
bible
to
exhorting
he
added
the
labor
on
sunday
of
teaching
and
for
nearly
forty
years
without
interruption
he
had
taken
charge
of
a
class
he
was
very
poor
and
the
incessant
labor
of
six
days
in
the
week
hardly
sufficed
to
the
support
of
himself
and
his
wife
and
the
family
that
began
to
fill
his
humble
lodging
nevertheless
at
the
very
time
of
his
conversion
he
was
seized
with
an
intense
longing
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
land
this
desire
strengthened
the
more
he
read
the
bible
and
became
interested
in
the
scenes
of
its
prophecies
and
miracles
he
resolved
to
go
yet
to
undertake
so
expensive
a
journey
at
the
time
was
impossible
nor
could
his
family
spare
his
daily
labor
but
early
in
his
married
life
he
came
to
a
notable
resolution
and
that
was
to
lay
by
something
every
year
no
matter
how
insignificant
the
sum
as
a
fund
for
his
pilgrimage
and
he
trusted
if
his
life
were
spared
long
enough
he
should
be
able
to
see
with
his
own
eyes
the
promised
land
if
that
might
be
granted
him
his
object
in
life
would
be
attained
and
he
should
be
willing
to
depart
in
peace
filled
with
this
sole
idea
he
labored
at
his
trade
without
relaxation
and
gave
his
sundays
and
evenings
to
a
most
diligent
study
of
the
bible
and
at
length
extended
his
reading
to
other
books
commentaries
and
travels
which
bore
upon
his
favorite
object
years
passed
by
his
palestine
fund
accumulated
more
slowly
than
his
information
about
that
land
but
he
was
never
discouraged
he
lost
at
one
time
a
considerable
sum
by
misplaced
confidence
in
a
comrade
but
nothing
disheartened
he
set
to
work
to
hammer
out
what
would
replace
it
of
course
such
industry
and
singleness
of
purpose
were
not
without
result
his
business
prospered
and
his
fund
increased
but
with
his
success
new
duties
opened
his
children
must
be
educated
for
he
was
determined
that
they
should
have
a
better
chance
in
england
than
their
father
had
been
given
the
expenses
of
their
education
and
his
contributions
to
the
maintenance
of
the
worship
of
his
society
interfered
sadly
with
his
pilgrimage
and
more
than
thirty
years
passed
before
he
saw
himself
in
possession
of
the
sum
that
he
could
spare
for
the
purchase
of
a
cook
ticket
to
the
holy
land
it
was
with
pardonable
pride
that
he
told
this
story
of
his
life
and
added
that
his
business
of
shoemaking
was
now
prosperous
that
he
had
now
a
shop
of
his
own
and
men
working
under
him
and
that
one
of
his
sons
who
would
have
as
good
an
education
as
any
nobleman
in
the
kingdom
was
a
student
at
the
college
in
london
of
all
the
party
with
whom
he
travelled
no
one
knew
the
bible
so
well
as
this
shoemaker
he
did
not
need
to
read
it
as
they
explored
the
historical
places
he
quoted
chapter
after
chapter
of
it
without
hesitation
or
consciousness
of
any
great
achievement
and
he
knew
almost
as
well
the
books
of
travel
that
relate
to
the
country
familiarity
with
the
english
of
the
bible
had
not
however
caused
him
to
abandon
his
primitive
speech
and
he
did
not
show
his
respect
for
the
sacred
book
by
adopting
its
grammatical
forms
such
phrases
as
does
i
good
to
see
he
eat
in
respect
to
a
convalescent
comrade
exhibited
this
peculiarity
indeed
he
preserved
his
independence
and
vindicated
the
reputation
of
his
craft
the
world
over
for
a
certain
obstinacy
of
opinion
if
not
philosophic
habit
of
mind
which
pounding
upon
leather
seems
to
promote
he
surprised
his
comrades
by
a
liberality
of
view
and
an
absence
of
narrowness
which
were
scarcely
to
be
expected
in
a
man
of
one
idea
i
was
pained
to
think
that
the
reality
of
the
holy
land
might
a
little
impair
the
celestial
vision
he
had
cherished
of
it
for
forty
years
but
perhaps
it
will
be
only
a
temporary
obscuration
for
the
imagination
is
stronger
than
the
memory
as
we
see
so
often
illustrated
in
the
writings
of
oriental
travellers
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
now
he
is
again
seated
on
his
bench
the
kingdoms
he
beholds
are
those
of
israel
and
judah
and
not
those
that
cook
showed
him
for
an
hundred
pounds
we
should
perhaps
add
that
our
shoemaker
cared
for
no
part
of
the
orient
except
palestine
and
for
no
history
except
that
in
the
bible
he
told
me
that
he
was
forwarded
from
london
to
rome
on
his
way
to
join
cook
pilgrims
at
cairo
in
the
company
of
a
party
of
select
baptists
so
they
were
styled
in
the
prospectus
of
their
journey
and
that
unexpectedly
to
himself
for
he
was
a
man
who
could
surmount
prejudices
he
found
them
very
good
fellows
but
that
he
was
obliged
to
spend
a
whole
day
in
rome
greatly
against
his
will
it
was
an
old
and
dilapidated
city
and
he
did
see
why
so
much
fuss
was
made
over
it
egypt
did
not
more
appeal
to
his
fancy
i
think
he
rather
loathed
it
both
its
past
and
its
present
as
the
seat
of
a
vain
heathenism
for
ruins
or
antiquities
not
mentioned
in
the
bible
he
cared
nothing
for
profane
architecture
still
less
palestine
was
his
goal
and
i
doubt
if
since
the
first
crusade
any
pilgrim
has
trod
the
streets
of
jerusalem
with
such
fervor
of
enthusiasm
as
this
illiterate
and
shoemaker
we
rode
one
afternoon
up
through
the
suburb
of
salahiyeh
to
the
sheykh
tomb
on
the
naked
hill
north
of
the
city
and
down
along
the
scarred
side
of
it
into
the
abana
gorge
this
ride
is
most
of
the
way
between
so
high
that
you
have
a
sight
of
nothing
but
the
sky
and
the
tops
of
trees
and
an
occasional
peep
through
chinks
in
a
rickety
gate
into
a
damp
and
neglected
garden
or
a
ragged
field
of
grain
under
trees
but
the
view
from
the
heights
over
the
vast
plain
of
damascus
with
the
city
embowered
in
its
green
is
superb
both
for
extent
and
color
and
quite
excuses
the
enthusiasm
expended
on
this
perennial
city
of
waters
we
had
occasional
glimpses
of
the
abana
after
it
leaves
the
city
and
we
could
trace
afar
off
the
course
of
the
pharpar
by
its
winding
ribbon
of
green
the
view
was
best
long
before
we
reached
the
summit
at
the
cemetery
and
the
ruined
mosque
when
the
minarets
showed
against
the
green
beyond
a
city
needs
to
be
seen
from
some
distance
and
from
not
too
high
an
elevation
looking
directly
down
upon
it
is
always
uninteresting
somewhere
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
to
the
right
of
our
course
one
of
the
moslem
legends
has
located
the
cave
of
the
seven
sleepers
knowing
that
the
cave
is
really
at
ephesus
we
did
not
care
to
anticipate
it
the
skeykh
tomb
is
simply
a
stucco
dome
on
the
ridge
and
exposed
to
the
draft
of
air
from
a
valley
behind
it
the
wind
blew
with
such
violence
that
we
could
scarcely
stand
there
and
we
made
all
our
observations
with
great
discomfort
what
we
saw
was
the
city
of
damascus
shaped
like
an
oval
dish
with
a
long
handle
the
handle
is
the
suburb
on
the
street
running
from
the
gate
of
god
that
sees
the
annual
procession
of
pilgrims
depart
for
mecca
many
brown
villages
dot
the
emerald
are
said
to
be
forty
in
the
whole
plain
towards
the
east
we
saw
the
desert
and
the
gray
sand
fading
into
the
gray
sky
of
the
horizon
that
way
lies
palmyra
by
that
route
goes
the
dromedary
post
to
bagdad
i
should
like
to
send
a
letter
by
it
the
view
of
the
abana
gorge
from
the
height
before
we
descended
was
unique
the
narrow
pass
is
filled
with
trees
but
through
them
we
could
see
the
white
french
road
and
the
abana
divided
into
five
streams
carried
at
different
levels
along
the
sides
in
order
to
convey
water
widely
over
the
plain
along
the
meadow
road
as
we
trotted
towards
the
city
as
indeed
everywhere
about
the
city
at
this
season
we
found
the
ground
marshy
and
vivacious
with
frogs
the
street
called
straight
runs
the
length
of
the
city
from
east
to
west
and
is
straight
in
its
general
intention
although
it
appears
to
have
been
laid
out
by
a
donkey
whose
attention
was
constantly
diverted
to
one
side
or
the
other
it
is
a
totally
uninteresting
lane
there
is
no
reason
however
to
suppose
that
paul
intended
to
be
facetious
when
he
spoke
of
it
in
his
day
it
was
a
magnificent
straight
avenue
one
hundred
feet
wide
and
two
rows
of
corinthian
colonnades
extending
a
mile
from
gate
to
gate
divided
it
lengthwise
this
was
an
architectural
fashion
of
that
time
the
colonnade
at
palmyra
which
is
seen
stalking
in
a
purposeless
manner
across
the
desert
was
doubtless
the
ornament
of
such
a
street
the
street
life
of
damascus
is
that
panorama
of
the
mean
and
the
picturesque
the
sordid
and
the
rich
of
silk
and
rags
of
many
costumes
and
all
colors
which
so
astonishes
the
oriental
traveller
at
first
but
to
which
he
speedily
becomes
so
accustomed
that
it
passes
almost
unnoticed
the
majority
of
the
women
are
veiled
but
not
so
scrupulously
as
those
of
cairo
yet
the
more
we
see
of
the
women
of
the
east
the
more
convinced
we
are
that
they
are
exceedingly
it
is
out
of
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
the
persons
they
meet
in
the
street
that
they
go
veiled
this
theory
is
supported
by
the
fact
that
the
daughters
of
bethlehem
who
are
all
comely
and
many
of
them
handsome
never
wear
veils
in
lounging
through
the
streets
the
whole
life
and
traffic
of
the
town
is
exposed
to
you
donkeys
loaded
with
panniers
of
oranges
or
with
sickly
watermelon
cut
up
stop
the
way
all
the
melons
of
the
east
that
i
have
tasted
are
flavorless
men
bearing
trays
of
sliced
boiled
beets
cry
aloud
their
deliciousness
as
if
they
were
some
fruit
of
paradise
boys
and
women
seated
on
the
ground
having
spread
before
them
on
a
paper

sort
of
uninviting
candy

wake
at
night
and
make
rome
howl
the
various
tradesmen
hammering
in
their
open
shops
the
plying
the
shuttle
the
makers
of
stirring
the
sticky
compounds
in
their
shining
copper
pots
and
pans
and
what
never
ceases
to
excite
your
admiration
is
the
of
the
surging
crowd
the
indifference
to
being
jostled
and
run
over
by
horses
donkeys
and
camels
damascus
may
have
abundant
testimony
that
it
good
city
if
as
i
said
one
could
see
it
arriving
you
dive
into
a
hole
and
scarcely
see
daylight
again
you
never
can
look
many
yards
before
you
you
move
in
a
sort
of
twilight
which
is
deepened
under
the
heavy
timber
roofs
of
the
bazaars
winding
through
endless
mazes
of
lanes
with
no
view
except
of
a
slender
strip
of
sky
you
occasionally
may
step
through
an
opening
in
the
wall
into
a
court
with
a
square
of
sunshine
a
tank
of
water
and
a
tree
or
two
the
city
can
be
seen
only
from
the
hill
or
from
a
minaret
and
then
you
look
only
upon
roofs
after
a
few
days
the
cooping
up
in
this
gorgeous
oriental
paradise
became
oppressive
we
drove
out
of
the
city
very
early
one
morning
i
was
obliged
to
the
muezzin
of
the
nearest
minaret
for
awakening
me
at
four
from
our
window
we
can
see
his
aerial
balcony
almost
overhangs
us
and
day
and
night
at
his
appointed
hours
we
see
the
turbaned
muezzin
circling
his
high
pinnacle
and
hear
him
projecting
his
long
call
to
prayer
over
the
city
roofs
when
we
came
out
at
the
west
gate
the
sun
was
high
enough
to
color
hermon
and
the
minarets
of
the
west
side
of
the
city
and
to
gleam
on
the
abana
as
we
passed
the
diligence
station
a
tall
nubian
an
employee
of
the
company
stood
there
in
the
attitude
of
seneschal
of
the
city
ugliness
had
marked
him
for
her
own
giving
him
a
large
damaged
expanse
of
face
from
which
exuded
however
an
inexpungible
he
sent
us
a
cheerful
salam
aloykem
peace
of
god
be
with
we
crossed
the
shaky
bridge
and
got
away
up
the
swift
stream
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
an
hour
our
last
view
with
the
level
sun
coming
over
the
roofs
and
spires
and
the
foreground
of
rapid
water
and
verdure
gave
us
damascus
in
its
loveliest
aspect
daylight
episode
of
turkish
justice
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
emerge
from
damascus
into
a
city
open
cheerful
it
was
to
the
world
how
brightly
it
lies
upon
its
sunny
promontory
climbing
up
the
slopes
and
crowning
every
eminence
with
villas
what
a
varied
prospect
it
commands
of
sparkling

and
curving
shore
of
country
broken
into
the
most
pleasing
diversity
of
hill
and

and

are
draped
in

that
retain
their
primitive
wildness

of
cypresses
and
of

and
terraces
draped
by
vines

clinging
to
the
heights

snowy
peaks

bounteous
land
of

beyrout
is
the
brightest
spot
in
syria
or
palestine
the
only
pleasant
city
that
we
saw
and
the
centre
of
a
moral
and
intellectual
impulse
the
importance
of
which
we
can
not
overestimate
the
mart
of
the
great
silk
industry
of
the
region
and
the
seaport
of
damascus
and
of
all
upper
syria
the
fitful
and
unintelligent
turkish
rule
even
can
not
stifle
its
exuberant
prosperity
but
above
all
the
advantages
which
nature
has
given
it
i
should
attribute
its
brightest
prospects
to
the
influence
of
the
american
mission
and
to
the
establishment
of
beyrout
college
for
almost
thirty
years
that
mission
has
sustained
here
a
band
of
erudite
scholars
whose
investigations
have
made
the
world
more
familiar
with
the
physical
character
of
palestine
than
the
people
of
connecticut
are
with
the
resources
of
their
own
state
and
of
wise
managers
whose
prudence
and
foresight
have
laid
deep
and
broad
the
foundations
of
a
syrian
civilization
i
do
not
know
how
many
converts
have
been
made
in
thirty
years
east
has
had
ample
illustration
from
the
abyssinians
to
the
colchians
of
without
knowledge
or
civilization
do
i
believe
that
any
of
the
workmen
themselves
to
the
can
put
in
visible
array
adequately
the
results
of
the
american
mission
in
syria
but
the
transient
visitor
can
see
something
of
them
in
the
dawning
of
a
better
social
life
in
the
beginning
of
an
improvement
in
the
condition
of
women
in
an
unmistakable
spirit
of
inquiry
and
a
recognizable
taste
for
intellectual
pursuits
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
birth
of
a
desire
for
instruction
for
the
enjoyment
of
literature
and
to
a
certain
extent
of
science
is
due
to
their
schools
and
that
their
admirably
conducted
press
which
has
sent
out
not
only
translations
of
the
scriptures
but
periodicals
of
secular
literature
and
information
and
elementary
geographies
histories
and
scientific
treatises
has
satisfied
the
want
which
the
schools
created
and
this
new
leaven
is
not
confined
to
a
sect
nor
limited
to
a
race
it
is
working
slowly
it
is
true
in
the
whole
of
syrian
society
the
press
establishment
is
near
the
pretty
and
substantial
church
of
the
mission
it
is
a
busy
and
printing
and
publishing
house
sending
out
besides
its
religious
works
and
a
monthly
and
a
weekly
publication
and
a
child
paper
which
has
a
large
and
paying
circulation
a
great
number
of
its
subscribers
being
moslems
these
regenerating
schools
and
the
happily
supplemented
by
the
college
which
offers
to
the
young
men
of
the
orient
the
chance
of
a
high
education
and
attracts
students
even
from
the
banks
of
the
nile
we
were
accompanied
to
the
college
by
jessup
and
post
and
spent
an
interesting
morning
in
inspecting
the
buildings
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
lovely
prospect
they
command
as
it
is
not
my
desire
to
enter
into
details
regarding
the
mission
or
the
college
any
further
than
is
necessary
to
emphasize
the
supreme
importance
of
this
enterprise
to
the
civilization
of
the
orient
i
will
only
add
that
the
college
has
already
some
interesting
collections
in
natural
history
a
particularly
valuable
herbarium
and
that
the
medical
department
is
not
second
in
promise
to
the
literary
it
is
sometimes
observed
that
a
city
is
like
a
man
in
that
it
will
preserve
through
all
mutations
and
disasters
certain
fundamental
traits
the
character
that
it
obtains
at
first
is
never
wholly
lost
but
reappears
again
and
again
asserting
its
individuality
after
it
may
be
centuries
of
obscurity
beyrout
was
early
a
seat
of
learning
and
a
centre
of
literary
influence
for
nearly
three
hundred
years
before
its
desolation
by
an
earthquake
in
the
middle
of
the
sixth
century
and
its
subsequent
devastation
by
the
followers
of
the
arabian
prophet
it
was
thronged
with
students
from
all
the
east
and
its
schools
of
philosophy
and
law
enjoyed
the
highest
renown
we
believe
that
it
is
gradually
resuming
its
ancient
prestige
while
we
were
waiting
day
after
day
the
arrival
of
the
austrian
steamboat
for
constantinople
we
were
drawn
into
a
little
drama
which
afforded
us
alternate
vexation
and
amusement
an
outline
of
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
as
an
illustration
of
the
vicissitudes
of
travel
in
the
east
or
for
other
reasons
which
may
appear
i
should
premise
that
the
american
consul
who
resided
here
with
his
family
was
not
in
good
repute
with
many
of
the
foreign
residents
that
he
was
charged
with
making
personal
contributions
to
himself
the
condition
of
the
continuance
in
office
of
his
subagents
in
syria
that
the
character
of
his
dragomans
or
at
least
one
of
them
named
ouardy
was
exceedingly
bad
and
brought
the
consular
office
and
the
american
name
into
contempt
and
that
these
charges
had
been
investigated
by
an
agent
sent
from
the
ministerial
bureau
in
constantinople
the
dragomans
of
the
consulate
who
act
as
interpreters
and
are
executors
of
the
authority
have
no
pay
but
their
position
gives
them
a
consideration
in
the
community
and
a
protection
which
they
turn
to
pecuniary
account
it
should
be
added
that
the
salary
of
the
consul
at
beyrout
is
two
thousand
dollars
sum
in
this
expensive
city
which
is
insufficient
to
support
a
consul
who
has
a
family
in
the
style
of
a
respectable
citizen
and
is
wholly
inadequate
to
the
maintenance
of
any
equality
with
the
representatives
of
other
nations
the
government
allows
no
outfit
nor
does
it
provide
for
the
return
of
its
consul
the
cost
of
transporting
himself
and
family
home
would
consume
almost
half
a
year
salary
and
the
tenure
of
the
office
is
uncertain
to
accept
any
of
several
of
our
oriental
consulships
a
man
must
either
have
a
private
fortune
or
an
unscrupulous
knack
of
living
by
his
wits
the
english
name
is
almost
universally
respected
in
the
east
so
far
as
my
limited
experience
goes
in
the
character
of
its
consuls
the
same
can
not
be
said
of
the
american
the
morning
after
our
arrival
descending
the
steps
of
the
hotel
i
found
our
dragoman
in
a
violent
altercation
with
another
dragoman
a
jew
and
a
resident
of
beyrout
there
is
always
a
latent
enmity
between
the
egyptian
and
the
syrian
dragomans
a
national
hostility
as
old
perhaps
as
the
shepherds
invasion
which
it
needs
only
an
occasion
to
blow
into
a
flame
the
disputants
were
surrounded
by
a
motley
crowd
nearly
all
of
them
the
adherents
of
the
syrian
i
had
seen
antoine
ouardy
at
luxor
when
he
was
the
dragoman
of
an
english
traveller
he
was
now
in
frank
dress
wearing
a
shining
hat
an
enormous
cluster
and
a
big
seal
ring
and
with
his
aggressive
nose
and
brazen
face
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
leading
in
the
bowery
on
the
nile
where
enjoys
the
distinction
of
sultan
among
his
class
the
fellow
was
his
humble
servant
but
he
had
now
caught
the
egyptian
away
from
home
and
was
disposed
to
make
the
most
of
his
advantage
chancing
to
meet
ouardy
this
morning
had
asked
for
the
payment
of
two
pounds
lent
at
luxor
the
debt
was
promptly
denied
and
when
his
own
for
the
money
was
produced
he
declared
that
he
had
received
the
money
from
in
payment
for
some
cigars
which
he
had
long
ago
purchased
for
him
in
alexandria
of
course
if
this
had
been
true
he
would
not
have
given
a
note
for
the
money
and
it
happened
that
i
had
been
present
when
the
sum
was
borrowed
the
brazen
denial
exasperated
our
dragoman
and
when
i
arrived
the
quarrel
had
come
nearly
to
blows
all
the
injurious
arabic
epithets
having
been
exhausted
the
lie
direct
had
been
given
back
and
forth
but
the
crowning
insult
was
added
in
english
when
cried
a
humbug
this
was
more
than
ouardy
could
stand
bursting
with
rage
he
shook
his
fist
in
the
egyptian
face
call
me
humbug
you
humbug
yourself
you
pay
for
this
i
shall
have
satisfaction
by
the
we
succeeded
in
separating
and
i
hoped
in
reducing
them
to
reason
but
antoine
went
off
muttering
vengeance
and
was
determined
to
bring
suit
for
his
money
i
represented
the
hopelessness
of
a
suit
in
a
turkish
court
the
delay
and
the
cost
of
lawyers
and
the
certainty
that
ouardy
would
produce
witnesses
to
anything
he
desired
to
prove
i
care
for
two
pound
exclaimed
the
heated
dragoman
go
to
spend
a
hundred
pound
but
i
have
shortly
after
as
was
walking
through
the
bazaars
with
one
of
the
ladies
of
our
party
he
was
set
upon
by
a
gang
of
ouardy
friends
and
knocked
down
the
old
man
recovered
himself
and
gave
battle
like
a
valiant
friend
of
the
prophet
ouardy
brother
sallied
out
from
his
shop
to
take
a
hand
in
the
scrimmage
and
happened
to
get
a
rough
handling
from
who
was
entirely
ignorant
of
his
relationship
to
antoine
the
whole
party
were
then
carried
off
to
the
seraglio
where
as
the
party
attacked
was
presumed
to
be
in
the
wrong
and
was
put
into
custody
in
the
inscrutable
administration
of
turkish
justice
the
man
who
is
knocked
down
in
a
quarrel
is
always
arrested
when
news
was
brought
to
us
at
the
hotel
of
this
mishap
i
sent
for
the
american
consul
as
our
dragoman
was
in
the
service
of
an
american
citizen
the
consul
sent
his
son
and
his
dragoman
and
the
dragoman
sent
to
assist
an
american
embarrassed
by
the
loss
of
his
servant
in
a
strange
city
turned
out
to
be
the
brother
of
antoine
ouardy
and
the
very
fellow
that
had
just
beaten
here
was
a
complication
dragoman
ouardy
showed
his
wounds
and
wanted
compensation
for
his
injuries
at
the
very
moment
we
needed
the
protection
of
the
american
government
its
representative
appeared
as
our
chief
prosecutor
however
we
sent
for
and
procured
his
release
from
the
seraglio
and
after
an
hour
of
conference
in
which
we
had
the
assistance
of
some
of
the
most
respectable
foreign
residents
of
the
city
we
flattered
ourselves
that
a
compromise
was
made
the
injured
ouardy
who
was
a
crafty
rogue
was
persuaded
not
to
insist
upon
a
suit
for
damages
which
would
greatly
incommode
an
american
citizen
and
seemed
willing
to
drop
his
suit
for
the
two
pounds
antoine
however
was
still
menacing
heard
him
he
appealed
to
me
heard
him
call
me
the
injurious
nature
of
this
mysterious
epithet
could
not
be
erased
from
his
mind
it
was
in
vain
that
i
told
him
it
had
been
freely
applied
to
a
american
until
it
had
become
a
badge
of
distinction
but
at
length
a
truce
was
patched
up
and
confident
that
there
would
be
no
more
trouble
i
went
into
the
country
for
a
long
walk
over
the
charming
hills
when
i
returned
at
six
the
camp
was
in
commotion
was
in
jail
there
was
a
suit
against
him
for
francs
for
horrible
and
unprovoked
injuries
to
the
dragoman
of
the
american
consul
the
consul
upon
written
application
for
assistance
made
by
the
ladies
at
the
hotel
had
curtly
declined
to
give
any
aid
and
espoused
the
quarrel
of
his
dragoman
it
appeared
that
attempting
again
to
accompany
a
lady
in
a
shopping
expedition
through
the
bazaars
had
been
sent
for
by
a
messenger
from
the
seraglio
as
he
could
not
leave
the
lady
in
the
street
he
carelessly
answered
that
he
would
come
by
and
by
a
few
minutes
after
he
was
arrested
by
a
squad
of
soldiers
and
taken
before
the
military
governor
respectfully
made
his
excuse
that
he
could
not
leave
the
lady
alone
in
the
street
but
the
pasha
said
that
he
would
teach
him
not
to
insult
his
authority
both
the
ouardy
brothers
were
beside
the
pasha
whispering
in
his
ear
and
as
the
result
of
their
deliberations
was
put
in
prison
it
was
saturday
afternoon
and
the
conspirators
expected
to
humiliate
the
old
man
by
keeping
him
locked
up
till
monday
this
was
the
state
of
the
game
when
i
came
to
dinner
the
faithful
abdallah
who
had
reluctantly
withdrawn
from
watching
the
outside
of
the
seraglio
where
his
master
was
confined
was
divided
in
mind
between
grief
and
alarm
on
the
one
side
and
his
duty
of
habitual
cheerfulness
to
us
on
the
other
and
consequently
announced
seraglio
as
a
piece
of
good
news
the
affair
had
got
wind
among
the
cafés
where
there
was
a
buzz
of
triumph
over
the
egyptians
and
at
the
hotel
everybody
was
drawn
into
the
excitement
discussing
the
assault
and
the
arrest
of
the
assaulted
party
the
american
consul
and
the
character
of
his
dragoman
and
the
general
inability
of
american
consuls
to
help
their
countrymen
in
time
of
need
the
principal
champion
of
was
mohammed
achmed
the
dragoman
of
two
american
ladies
who
had
been
travelling
in
egypt
and
palestine
achmed
was
a
character
he
had
the
pure
arab
physiognomy
the
vivacity
of
an
italian
the
restlessness
of
an
american
the
courtesy
of
the
most
polished
oriental
and
a
unique
use
of
the
english
tongue
copious
in
speech
at
times
flighty
in
manner
gravely
humorous
and
more
than
the
yankee
he
was
an
exceedingly
experienced
and
skilful
dragoman
and
perfectly
honest
to
his
employers
achmed
was
clad
in
baggy
trousers
a
silk
scarf
about
his
waist
short
open
jacket
and
wore
his
tarboosh
on
the
back
of
his
sloping
head
he
had
a
habit
of
throwing
back
his
head
and
half
closing
his
wandering
restless
black
eyes
in
speaking
and
his
gestures
and
attitudes
might
have
been
called
theatrical
but
for
a
certain
simple
sincerity
yet
any
extravagance
of
speech
or
action
was
always
saved
from
an
appearance
of
absurdity
by
a
humorous
twinkle
in
his
eyes
alexandria
was
his
home
while
lived
in
cairo
the
natural
rivalry
between
the
dragomans
of
the
two
cities
had
been
imbittered
by
some
personal
disagreement
and
they
were
only
on
terms
of
the
most
distant
civility
but
misfortune
not
only
roused
his
national
pride
but
touched
his
quick
generosity
and
he
surprised
his
employers
by
the
enthusiasm
with
which
he
espoused
the
cause
and
defended
the
character
of
the
man
he
had
so
lately
regarded
as
anything
but
a
friend
he
went
to
work
with
unselfish
zeal
to
procure
his
release
he
would
think
of
nothing
else
talk
of
nothing
else
is
it
achmed
they
said
you
and
have
suddenly
become
such
good
friends
my
lady
answers
achmed
taking
an
attitude
know
not
one
of
the
men
in
all
egypt
not
a
common
dragoman
like
these
in
beyrout
my
lady
you
shall
ask
in
cairo
what
a
man
of
esteem
to
tell
it
in
cairo
that
he
is
in
jail
is
my
friend
what
has
been
sometime
that
is
nothing
it
must
not
be
that
he
is
in
jail
and
he
come
out
in
half
an
hour
if
your
consul
say
is
not
so
certain
but
what
can
we
do
to
the
consul
american
that
he
shall
let
go
you
my
lady
said
achmed
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
before
the
person
he
was
addressing
a
letter
and
say
i
want
my
dragoman
immediate
if
he
will
not
i
go
to
the
english
consul
i
know
he
will
do
it
excuse
me
but
will
you
make
the
letter
when
it
was
the
english
consul
he
does
something
when
it
was
the
american
i
pick
your
pargin
my
lady
he
is
not
so
much
esteem
in
compliance
with
achmed
entreaty
a
note
was
written
to
the
consul
but
it
produced
no
effect
except
an
uncivil
reply
that
it
was
after
office
hours
when
i
returned
achmed
was
in
a
high
fever
of
excitement
he
believed
that
would
be
released
if
i
would
go
personally
to
the
consul
and
insist
upon
it
consul
i
do
not
know
what
kind
of
man
this
is
for
consul
does
he
know
what
man
is
take
my
advice
continued
achmed
half
closing
his
eyes
throwing
back
his
head
and
moving
it
alertly
on
the
axis
of
his
neck
and
making
at
the
same
time
a
deprecatory
gesture
with
the
back
of
his
hands
turned
out
my
advice
mesr
vahl
is
a
man
of
respect
he
is
a
man
very
rich
god
forgive
me
man
there
is
no
better
family
in
egypt
than
effendi
you
have
seen
he
is
the
friend
of
governors
and
pashas
there
is
no
man
of
more
respect
in
cairo
to
put
in
jail
they
would
not
believe
it
when
he
is
at
home
no
one
could
do
it
the
khedive
himself
he
continued
warming
with
his
theme
not
touch
he
has
houses
in
the
city
and
farms
and
plantations
in
the
country
a
man
very
well
known
who
in
cairo
is
to
put
him
in
jail
this
with
a
smile
of
derision
i
think
he
take
out
and
put
in
prison
almost
anybody
else
he
like
mohammed
effendi
see
when
this
ouardy
comes
in
egypt
we
hastened
to
the
consul
i
told
the
consul
that
i
was
deprived
of
the
service
of
my
dragoman
that
he
was
unjustly
imprisoned
simply
for
defending
himself
when
he
was
assailed
by
a
lot
of
rowdies
and
that
as
the
complaint
against
him
was
supposed
to
issue
from
the
consulate
i
doubted
not
that
the
consul
influence
could
release
him
the
consul
replied
with
suavity
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
quarrel
of
his
dragoman
and
was
not
very
well
informed
about
it
only
he
knew
that
ouardy
had
been
outrageously
assaulted
and
beaten
by
that
he
could
do
nothing
at
any
rate
with
the
pasha
even
if
that
functionary
had
not
gone
to
his
harem
outside
the
city
where
nobody
would
disturb
him
i
ventured
to
say
that
both
the
ouardys
had
a
very
bad
reputation
in
the
city
was
in
fact
infamous
that
the
consulate
was
brought
into
contempt
by
them
the
consul
replied
that
the
reputation
of
antoine
might
be
bad
but
that
his
dragoman
was
a
respectable
merchant
and
then
he
complained
of
the
missionaries
who
had
persecuted
him
ever
since
he
had
been
in
beyrout
i
said
that
i
knew
nothing
of
his
grievances
that
my
information
about
his
dragoman
came
from
general
report
and
from
some
of
the
bankers
and
most
respectable
citizens
and
that
i
knew
that
in
this
case
my
dragoman
had
been
set
upon
in
the
first
instance
and
that
it
was
believed
that
the
ouardys
were
now
attempting
to
extort
money
from
him
knowing
him
to
be
rich
and
having
got
him
in
their
clutches
away
from
his
friends
the
consul
still
said
that
he
could
do
nothing
that
night
he
was
very
sorry
very
sorry
for
my
embarrassment
and
he
would
send
for
ouardy
and
advise
him
to
relinquish
his
prosecution
on
my
account
well
i
said
rising
to
go
you
can
not
help
me
i
must
go
elsewhere
will
you
give
me
a
note
of
introduction
to
the
pasha
he
would
do
that
with
pleasure
although
he
was
certain
that
nothing
would
come
of
it
achmed
who
had
been
impatiently
waiting
on
the
high
piazza
it
is
a
charming
situation
overlooking
the
mediterranean
saw
that
i
had
not
succeeded
and
was
for
going
at
once
to
the
english
consul
for
all
dragomans
have
entire
confidence
that
english
consuls
are
i
said
will
try
the
pasha
to
whom
i
have
a
letter
though
the
consul
says
the
pasha
is
a
friend
of
believe
you
ouardy
has
women
in
his
house
the
pasha
goes
often
there
so
i
hear
but
we
will
go
i
will
speak
to
the
pasha
also
and
tell
him
what
for
a
man
is
a
very
pleasant
man
the
pasha
and
speak
all
languages
very
well
it
was
encouraging
to
know
this
and
i
began
to
feel
that
i
could
make
some
impression
on
him
we
took
a
carriage
and
drove
into
the
suburbs
to
the
house
of
the
pasha
his
excellency
was
in
his
harem
and
dining
at
that
hour
i
was
shown
by
a
barefooted
servant
into
a
barren
parlor
furnished
in
the
european
style
and
informed
that
the
pasha
would
see
me
presently
after
a
while
cigarettes
and
poor
substitute
for
dinner
for
a
person
who
had
had
brought
in
but
no
pasha
i
waited
there
i
suppose
nearly
an
hour
for
the
governor
to
finish
his
dinner
and
meantime
composed
a
complimentary
oration
to
deliver
upon
his
arrival
when
his
excellency
at
last
appeared
i
beheld
a
large
sleek
turk
whose
face
showed
and
i
had
hopes
of
him
and
advancing
to
salute
him
began
an
apology
for
disturbing
his
repose
at
this
unseasonable
hour
but
his
excellency
looked
perfectly
blank
he
did
not
understand
a
word
of
english
i
gave
him
the
letter
of
the
consul
and
mentioned
the
name
the
pasha
took
the
letter
and
opened
it
but
as
he
was
diligently
examining
it
upside
down
i
saw
that
he
did
not
read
english
i
must
introduce
myself
opening
the
door
i
called
achmed
in
coming
into
the
presence
of
this
high
rank
all
his
buoyancy
and
bravado
vanished
he
obsequiously
waited
i
told
him
to
say
to
his
excellency
how
extremely
sorry
i
was
to
disturb
his
repose
at
such
an
unseasonable
hour
but
that
my
dragoman
whose
services
i
needed
had
been
unfortunately
locked
up
that
i
was
an
american
citizen
as
he
would
perceive
by
the
letter
from
the
consul
and
that
i
would
detain
him
only
a
moment
with
my
business
achmed
put
this
into
choice
arabic
his
excellency
looked
more
blank
than
before
he
did
not
understand
a
word
of
arabic
the
interview
was
getting
to
be
interesting
the
pasha
then
stepped
to
the
door
and
called
in
his
dragoman
a
barefooted
fellow
in
a
tattered
gown
the
two
interpreters
stood
in
line
before
us
and
the
pasha
nodded
to
me
to
begin
i
opened
perhaps
a
little
too
elaborately
achmed
put
my
remarks
into
arabic
and
the
second
dragoman
translated
that
again
into
turkish
what
the
speech
became
by
the
time
it
reached
the
ear
of
the
pasha
i
could
not
tell
but
his
face
darkened
at
once
and
he
peremptorily
shook
his
head
the
word
came
back
to
me
that
the
pasha
would
let
him
out
must
stay
in
jail
till
his
trial
i
then
began
to
argue
the
matter
say
that
there
was
no
criminal
suit
against
him
only
an
action
for
damages
and
that
i
would
be
responsible
for
his
appearance
when
required
the
translations
were
made
but
i
saw
that
i
was
every
moment
losing
ground
no
one
could
tell
what
my
solicitations
became
after
being
strained
through
arabic
and
turkish
my
case
was
lost
because
it
could
not
be
heard
suddenly
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
pasha
might
know
some
european
language
i
turned
to
him
and
asked
him
if
he
spoke
german
o
yes
the
prospect
brightened
and
if
i
also
had
spoken
that
language
we
should
have
had
no
further
trouble
however
desperation
beat
up
my
misty
recollection
and
i
gave
the
pasha
a
torrent
of
broken
german
that
evidently
astonished
him
at
any
rate
he
became
gracious
as
soon
as
he
understood
me
he
said
that
was
not
confined
on
account
of
the
suit
knew
nothing
and
cared
nothing
for
his
difficulty
with
ouardy
for
his
contempt
of
the
police
and
soldiers
i
explained
that
and
added
that
was
an
old
man
that
i
had
been
doctoring
him
for
a
fever
ever
since
we
were
in
damascus
that
i
feared
to
have
him
stay
in
that
damp
jail
over
sunday
and
that
i
would
be
responsible
for
his
appearance
you
mean
to
say
he
asked
you
will
be
personally
responsible
that
he
appears
at
the
seraglio
monday
morning
i
said
his
appearance
at
any
time
and
place
your
excellency
may
he
may
he
gave
the
order
to
his
dragoman
to
accompany
us
and
procure
his
release
and
we
retired
with
mutual
protestations
of
the
highest
consideration
achmed
was
nearly
beside
himself
with
joy
the
horses
seemed
to
him
to
crawl
he
could
wait
the
moment
to
announce
to
his
deliverance
they
thought
to
keep
in
jail
all
night
and
sent
word
to
cairo
is
in
jail
effendi
take
my
advice
a
man
of
the
court
of
the
old
seraglio
prison
to
which
the
guards
admitted
us
without
question
was
only
dimly
lighted
by
an
or
two
and
we
could
distinguish
a
few
figures
flitting
about
who
looked
like
malefactors
but
were
probably
keepers
we
were
shown
into
a
side
room
where
sat
upon
the
ground
an
official
perhaps
a
judge
and
two
assistants
was
sent
for
the
old
man
was
brought
in
swinging
his
string
of
beads
in
his
hand
looking
somewhat
but
preserving
a
portentous
gravity
i
arose
and
shook
hands
with
him
and
told
him
we
had
come
to
take
him
out
when
we
were
seated
a
discussion
of
the
case
sprung
up
the
official
talked
his
two
assistants
talked
and
and
achmed
talked
and
there
was
evidently
a
disposition
to
go
over
the
affair
from
the
beginning
it
was
a
pity
to
cut
short
so
much
eloquence
but
i
asked
the
dragoman
to
deliver
his
message
and
told
achmed
that
we
would
postpone
the
discussion
till
monday
and
depart
at
once
the
prisoner
was
released
and
declining
coffee
we
shook
hands
and
got
away
with
all
haste
as
we
drove
to
the
hotel
was
somewhat
pensive
but
declared
that
he
would
rather
give
a
hundred
pounds
than
not
be
let
out
that
night
and
when
we
reached
home
achmed
whose
spirits
were
exuberant
insisted
on
dragging
him
to
the
café
opposite
to
exhibit
him
in
triumph
when
i
came
down
in
the
morning
achmed
was
in
the
hall
achmed
how
are
you
closing
his
eyes

a
humorous
twinkle

pasha
and
the
consul
i
think
am
i
responded
in
his
most
serious
manner
the
question
with
these
experienced
dragomans
instantly
resolves
itself
into
a
question
of
money
whoever
is
concerned
and
whatever
is
the
tribunal
i
said
that
i
would
see
the
consul
in
the
morning
and
that
i
hoped
to
have
all
proceedings
stopped
so
that
we
could
get
off
in
the
steamer
shook
his
head
consul
not
to
do
anything
ouardy
have
lent
him
money
so
i
beyrout
had
a
sunday
appearance
the
shops
were
nearly
all
closed
and
the
churches
especially
the
catholic
were
crowded
it
might
have
been
a
peaceful
day
but
for
our
imbroglio
which
began
to
be
serious
we
could
not
afford
the
time
to
wait
two
weeks
for
the
next
cyprus
steamer
we
did
not
like
to
abandon
our
dragomans
and
we
needed
their
services
the
ladies
who
depended
upon
achmed
were
in
a
quandary
notes
went
to
the
consul
but
produced
no
effect
the
bankers
were
called
into
the
council
and
one
of
them
undertook
to
get
achmed
free
travellers
citizens
and
all
began
to
get
interested
or
entangled
in
the
case
there
was
among
respectable
people
but
one
opinion
about
the
dragoman
at
night
it
was
whispered
about
that
the
american
consul
had
already
been
removed
and
that
his
successor
was
on
his
way
to
beyrout
achmed
came
to
us
in
the
highest
spirits
with
the
news
all
day
monday
we
expected
the
steamer
the
day
was
frittered
away
in
interviews
with
the
consul
and
the
pasha
and
in
endeavoring
to
learn
something
of
the
two
cases
the
suit
for
damages
and
for
the
debt
supposed
to
be
going
on
somewhere
in
the
seraglio
after
my
interview
with
the
consul
who
expressed
considerable
ignorance
of
the
case
and
the
strongest
desire
to
stop
it
i
was
surprised
to
find
at
the
seraglio
all
the
papers
in
the
consul
name
and
all
the
documents
written
on
consular
paper
so
that
when
i
appeared
as
an
american
citizen
to
endeavor
to
get
my
dragoman
released
it
appeared
to
the
turkish
officials
that
they
would
please
the
american
government
by
detaining
and
punishing
him
the
was
a
little
upper
chamber
with
no
furniture
except
a
long
table
and
chairs
three
moslem
judges
sat
at
one
end
of
the
table
apparently
waiting
to
see
what
would
turn
up
the
scene
was
not
unlike
that
in
an
office
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
in
america
the
parties
to
the
case
witnesses
attendants
spectators
came
and
went
as
it
pleased
them
talked
or
whispered
to
the
judges
or
to
each
other
there
seemed
to
be
no
rule
for
the
reception
or
rejection
of
evidence
the
judges
smoked
and
gathered
the
facts
as
they
drifted
in
and
would
by
and
by
make
up
their
minds
it
is
truth
to
say
however
that
they
seemed
to
be
endeavoring
to
get
at
the
facts
and
that
they
appeared
to
be
above
prejudice
or
interest
a
new
complication
developed
itself
however
antoine
ouardy
claimed
to
be
a
french
citizen
and
the
french
consul
was
drawn
into
the
fray
this
was
a
new
device
to
delay
proceedings
when
i
had
given
my
evidence
to
the
judges
which
i
was
required
to
put
in
writing
i
went
with
to
the
room
of
the
pasha
this
official
was
gracious
enough
but
gave
us
no
hopes
of
release
he
took
me
one
side
and
advised
me
as
a
traveller
to
look
out
for
another
dragoman
there
was
no
prospect
that
could
get
away
to
accompany
me
on
this
steamer
fact
the
process
in
court
might
detain
him
six
months
however
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
go
to
the
american
consul
with
ouardy
and
settle
it
he
thought
ouardy
would
settle
it
for
a
reasonable
amount
it
was
none
of
his
business
but
that
was
his
advice
we
were
obliged
to
his
excellency
for
this
glimpse
behind
the
scenes
of
a
turkish
court
and
thanked
him
for
his
advice
but
we
did
not
follow
it
thought
that
if
he
abandoned
the
attempt
to
collect
a
debt
in
a
turkish
city
he
ought
not
besides
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
doing
so
tuesday
morning
the
steamer
came
into
the
harbor
although
we
had
registered
our
names
at
the
office
of
the
company
for
passage
nothing
was
reserved
for
us
detained
at
the
seraglio
and
the
consul
we
could
not
go
off
to
secure
places
and
the
consequence
was
that
we
were
subject
to
the
of
the
steward
when
we
did
go
by
noon
there
were
signs
of
the
failure
of
the
prosecution
and
we
sent
off
our
luggage
in
an
hour
or
two
appeared
with
a
troop
of
friends
triumphant
somewhere
i
do
not
know
how
he
and
achmed
had
raked
up
fourteen
witnesses
in
his
favor
the
judges
would
believe
ouardy
nor
any
one
he
produced
and
his
case
had
utterly
broken
down
this
mountain
of
a
case
which
had
annoyed
us
so
many
days
and
absorbed
our
time
suddenly
collapsed
we
were
not
sorry
to
leave
even
beautiful
beyrout
and
would
have
liked
to
see
the
last
of
turkish
rule
as
well
at
sunset
on
the
steamer
achille
swarming
above
and
below
with
pilgrims
from
jerusalem
and
mecca
we
sailed
for
cyprus
in
the
early
morning
we
were
off
cyprus
in
the
open
harbor
of
larnaka
row
of
white
houses
on
the
low
shore
the
town
is
not
peculiar
and
not
specially
attractive
but
the
marina
lies
prettily
on
the
blue
sea
and
the
palms
the
cypresses
the
minarets
and
form
an
agreeable
picture
behind
it
backed
by
the
lovely
outline
of
mountains
conspicuous
among
them
santa
croce
the
highest
olympus
can
not
be
seen
from
this
point
a
night
had
sufficed
to
transport
us
into
another
world
a
world
in
which
all
outlines
are
softened
and
colored
a
world
in
which
history
appears
like
romance
we
might
have
imagined
that
we
had
sailed
into
some
tropical
harbor
except
that
the
island
before
us
was
bare
of
foliage
there
was
the
calm
of
perfect
repose
in
the
sky
on
the
sea
and
the
land
cyprus
made
no
harsh
contrast
with
the
azure
water
in
which
it
seemed
to
be
anchored
for
the
morning
as
our
ship
was
you
could
believe
that
the
calm
of
summer
and
of
early
morning
always
rested
on
the
island
and
that
it
slept
exhausted
in
the
memory
of
its
glorious
past
taking
a
cup
of
coffee
we
rowed
ashore
it
was
the
festival
of
george
and
the
flags
of
various
nations
were
hung
out
along
the
riva
or
displayed
from
the
staffs
of
the
consular
residences
it
is
one
of
the
chief
fête
days
of
the
year
and
the
foreign
representatives
who
have
not
too
much
excitement
celebrated
it
by
formal
visits
to
the
greek
consul
larnaka
does
not
keep
a
hotel
and
we
wandered
about
for
some
time
before
we
could
discover
its
sole
locanda
where
we
purposed
to
breakfast
this
establishment
would
please
an
artist
but
it
had
few
attractions
for
a
person
wishing
to
break
his
fast
and
our
unusual
demand
threw
it
into
confusion
the
locanda
was
nothing
but
a
kitchen
in
a
building
with
an
earth
floor
and
a
rickety
table
or
two
after
long
delay
the
cheerful
greek
proprietor
and
his
lively
willingness
both
to
furnish
us
next
to
nothing
but
the
best
they
had
from
their
scanty
larder
and
to
cipher
up
a
long
reckoning
for
the
same
excited
our
some
fried
veal
sour
bread
harsh
wine
and
tart
oranges
and
we
breakfasted
more
sumptuously
i
have
no
doubt
than
any
natives
of
the
island
that
morning
the
scant
and
hard
fare
of
nearly
all
the
common
people
in
the
east
would
be
unendurable
to
any
american
but
i
think
that
the
hardy
peasantry
of
the
levant
would
speedily
fall
into
dyspeptic
degeneracy
upon
the
introduction
of
american
rural
cooking
after
we
had
killed
our
appetites
at
the
locanda
we
presented
our
letters
to
the
american
consul
general
di
cesnola
in
whose
spacious
residence
we
experienced
a
delightful
mingling
of
oriental
and
western
hospitality
the
kawâss
of
the
general
was
sent
to
show
us
the
town
this
kawâss
was
a
gorgeous
official
a
kind
of
glorified
being
in
silk
and
who
marched
before
us
huge
in
bulk
waving
his
truncheon
of
office
and
gave
us
the
appearance
in
spite
of
our
humility
of
a
triumphal
procession
larnaka
has
not
many
sights
although
it
was
the
residence
of
the
lusignan
dynasty
cour
de
lion
having
toward
the
close
of
the
twelfth
century
made
a
gift
of
the
island
to
guy
de
lusignan
it
has
however
some
mosques
and
greek
churches
the
church
of
lazarus
which
contains
the
now
vacant
tomb
of
the
lazarus
who
was
raised
from
the
dead
at
bethany
and
afterwards
became
bishop
of
citium
is
an
interesting
old
byzantine
edifice
and
has
attached
to
it
an
english
with
tombs
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
greek
priest
who
showed
us
the
church
does
not
lose
sight
of
the
gain
of
godliness
in
this
life
while
pursuing
in
this
remote
station
his
heavenly
journey
he
sold
my
friend
some
exquisite
old
crucifixes
carved
in
wood
mounted
in
antique
silver
which
he
took
from
the
altar
and
he
let
the
church
part
with
some
of
its
quaint
old
pictures
commemorating
the
impossible
exploits
of
demetrius
and
george
but
he
was
very
careful
that
none
of
the
greeks
who
were
lounging
about
the
church
should
be
witnesses
of
the
transfer
he
said
that
these
ignorant
people
had
a
prejudice
about
these
sacred
objects
and
might
make
trouble
the
excavations
made
at
larnaka
have
demonstrated
that
this
was
the
site
of
ancient
citium
the
birthplace
of
zeno
the
stoic
and
the
chittim
so
often
alluded
to
by
the
hebrew
prophets
it
was
a
phoenician
colony
and
when
ezekiel
foretold
the
unrecoverable
fall
of
tyre
among
the
luxuries
of
wealth
he
enumerated
were
the
of
ivory
brought
out
of
the
isles
of
paul
does
not
mention
it
but
he
must
have
passed
through
it
when
he
made
his
journey
over
the
island
from
salamis
to
paphos
where
he
had
his
famous
encounter
with
the
sorcerer
a
few
miles
out
of
town
on
the
road
to
citti
is
a
turkish
mosque
which
shares
the
high
veneration
of
moslems
with
those
of
mecca
and
jerusalem
in
it
is
interred
the
of
mohammed
we
walked
on
out
of
the
town
to
the
most
considerable
church
in
the
place
newly
built
by
the
roman
catholics
there
is
attached
to
it
a
franciscan
convent
a
neat
establishment
with
a
garden
and
the
hospitable
monks
when
they
knew
we
were
americans
insisted
upon
entertaining
us
the
contributions
for
their
church
had
largely
come
from
america
they
said
and
they
seemed
to
regard
us
as
among
the
number
of
their
benefactors
this
christian
charity
expressed
itself
also
in
some
bunches
of
roses
which
the
brothers
plucked
for
our
ladies
one
can
not
but
suspect
and
respect
that
timid
sentiment
the
monk
retains
for
the
sex
whose
faces
he
flies
from
which
he
expresses
in
the
care
of
flowers
the
blushing
rose
seems
to
be
the
pure
and
only
link
between
the
monk
and
womankind
he
may
cultivate
it
without
sin
and
offer
it
to
the
chance
visitor
without
scandal
the
day
was
lovely
but
the
sun
had
intense
power
and
in
default
of
donkeys
we
took
a
private
carriage
into
the
country
to
visit
the
church
of
george
at
which
the
fête
day
of
that
saint
was
celebrated
by
a
fair
and
a
concourse
of
peasants
our
carriage
was
a
cart
a
sort
of
drawn
by
two
steers
and
driven
by
a
greek
boy
in
an
embroidered
jacket
the
franciscans
lent
us
chairs
for
the
cart
the
resplendent
kawass
marched
ahead
hung
his
legs
over
the
tail
of
the
cart
in
an
attitude
of
dejection
and
we
moved
on
but
so
slowly
that
my
english
friend
edward
rae
was
able
to
sketch
us
and
the
cyprians
could
enjoy
the
spectacle
the
country
lay
bare
and
blinking
under
the
sun
save
here
and
there
a
palm
or
a
bunch
of
cypresses
this
part
of
the
island
has
not
a
tree
or
a
large
shrub
the
view
of
the
town
and
the
sea
with
its
boats
as
we
went
inland
was
peculiar
not
anything
real
but
a
skeleton
picture
the
sky
and
sea
were
indigo
blue
we
found
a
crowd
of
peasants
at
the
church
of
george
which
has
a
dirty
interior
like
all
the
greek
churches
the
greeks
as
well
as
the
other
orientals
know
how
to
mingle
devotion
with
the
profits
of
trade
and
while
there
were
rows
of
booths
outside
and
traffic
went
on
briskly
the
church
was
thronged
with
men
and
women
who
bought
tapers
for
offerings
and
kissed
with
fervor
the
holy
relics
which
were
exposed
the
articles
for
sale
at
the
booths
and
stands
were
chiefly
eatables
and
the
coarsest
sort
of
merchandise
the
only
specialty
of
native
manufacture
was
rude
but
little
bells
which
are
sometimes
strung
upon
the
necks
of
donkeys
but
so
fond
are
these
simple
people
of
musical
noise
that
these
bells
are
attached
to
the
handles
of
sickles
also
the
barley
was
already
in
the
fields
and
many
of
the
peasants
at
the
fair
brought
their
sickles
with
them
they
were
both
men
and
women
a
primitive
sort
of
people
certainly
not
a
handsome
race
but
picturesque
in
appearance
both
sexes
affect
high
colors
and
the
bright
petticoats
of
the
women
matched
the
gay
jackets
of
their
husbands
and
lovers
we
do
not
know
what
was
the
ancient
standard
of
beauty
in
cyprus
it
may
have
been
no
higher
than
it
is
now
and
perhaps
the
swains
at
this
fête
of
george
would
turn
from
any
other
type
of
female
charms
as
uninviting
the
cyprian
or
paphian
venus
could
not
have
been
a
beauty
according
to
our
notions
the
images
of
her
which
general
di
cesnola
found
in
her
temple
all
have
a
long
and
sharp
nose
these
images
are
phoenician
and
were
made
six
hundred
to
a
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
at
the
time
that
wonderful
people
occupied
this
fertile
island
it
is
an
interesting
fact
and
an
extraordinary
instance
of
the
persistence
of
nature
in
perpetuating
a
type
that
all
the
women
of
cyprus
are
with
scarcely
any
exception
exactly
the
nose
of
the
ancient
paphian
venus
that
is
to
say
the
nose
of
the
phoenician
women
whose
husbands
and
lovers
sailed
the
mediterranean
as
long
ago
as
the
siege
of
troy
it
was
off
the
southern
coast
of
this
island
near
paphos
that
venus
aphrodite
born
of
the
foam
is
fabled
to
have
risen
from
the
sea
the
anniversary
of
her
birth
is
still
perpetuated
by
an
annual
fête
on
the
of
august
rite
having
its
foundation
in
nature
that
has
proved
to
be
stronger
than
religious
instruction
or
prejudice
originally
these
fêtes
were
the
scenes
of
a
too
literal
worship
of
venus
and
even
now
the
cyprian
maiden
thinks
that
her
chance
of
matrimony
is
increased
by
her
attendance
at
this
annual
fair
upon
that
day
all
the
young
people
go
upon
the
sea
in
small
boats
and
until
recently
it
used
to
be
the
custom
to
dip
a
virgin
into
the
water
in
remembrance
of
the
mystic
birth
of
venus
that
ceremony
is
still
partially
maintained
instead
of
sousing
the
maiden
in
the
sea
her
companions
spatter
the
representative
of
the
goddess
with
salt
water
has
given
way
here
also
to
sprinkling
the
lively
curiosity
of
the
world
has
been
of
late
years
turned
to
cyprus
as
the
theatre
of
some
of
the
most
important
and
extensive
archaeological
discoveries
of
this
century
discoveries
unique
and
illustrative
of
the
manners
and
religion
of
a
race
once
the
most
civilized
in
the
levant
of
which
only
the
slightest
monuments
had
hitherto
been
discovered
discoveries
which
supply
the
lost
link
between
egyptian
and
grecian
art
these
splendid
results
which
by
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
confer
some
credit
upon
the
american
nation
are
wholly
due
to
the
scholarship
patient
industry
address
and
enthusiasm
of
one
man
to
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
magnificent
cesnola
collection
which
is
the
chief
attraction
of
the
metropolitan
museum
of
new
york
i
need
make
no
apology
for
devoting
a
few
paragraphs
to
the
antiquities
of
cyprus
and
their
explorer
cyprus
was
the
coveted
prize
of
all
the
conquerors
of
the
orient
in
turn
the
fair
island
with
an
area
not
so
large
as
the
state
of
connecticut
owns
in
its
unequal
surface
the
extremes
of
the
temperate
climate
snow
lies
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
upon
its
mountains
which
attain
an
altitude
of
over
seven
thousand
feet
and
the
palm
spreads
its
along
the
southern
coast
and
in
the
warm
plains
irregular
in
shape
it
has
an
extreme
length
of
over
one
hundred
and
forty
miles
and
an
average
breadth
of
about
forty
miles
and
its
deeply
indented
coast
gives
an
extraordinarily
long
and
offers
the
facilities
of
harbors
for
the
most
active
commerce
the
maritime
phoenicians
early
discovered
its
advantages
and
in
the
seventeenth
century
or
a
little
later
a
colony
from
sidon
settled
at
citium
and
in
time
these
yankees
of
the
levant
occupied
all
the
southern
portion
of
the
island
with
their
busy
ports
and
royal
cities
there
is
a
tradition
that
teucer
after
the
trojan
war
founded
the
city
of
salamis
on
the
east
coast
but
however
this
may
be
and
whatever
may
be
the
exact
date
of
the
advent
of
the
sidonians
upon
the
island
it
is
tolerably
certain
that
they
were
in
possession
about
the
year
when
the
navy
of
thotmes
the
greatest
conqueror
and
statesman
in
the
long
line
of
pharaohs
visited
cyprus
and
collected
tribute
the
egyptians
were
never
sailors
and
the
fleet
of
thotmes
iii
was
no
doubt
composed
of
phoenician
ships
manned
by
phoenician
sailors
he
was
already
in
possession
of
the
whole
of
syria
the
phoenicians
were
his
tributaries
and
allies
their
ships
alone
sailed
the
grecian
seas
and
carried
the
products
of
egypt
and
of
asia
to
the
pelasgic
populations
the
phoenician
supremacy
established
by
sidon
in
cyprus
was
maintained
by
tyre
and
it
was
not
seriously
subverted
until
when
the
assyrian
ravager
of
syria
sargon
sent
a
fleet
and
conquered
cyprus
he
set
up
a
stele
in
citium
commemorating
his
exploit
which
has
been
preserved
and
is
now
in
the
museum
at
berlin
two
centuries
later
the
island
owned
the
persians
as
masters
and
was
comprised
in
the
fifth
satrapy
of
darius
it
became
a
part
of
the
empire
of
the
macedonian
alexander
after
his
conquest
of
asia
minor
and
was
again
an
egyptian
province
under
the
ptolemies
until
the
roman
eagles
swooped
down
upon
it
coins
are
not
seldom
found
that
tell
the
story
of
these
occupations
those
bearing
the
head
of
ptolemy
physcon
euergetes
found
at
paphos
and
undoubtedly
struck
there
witness
the
residence
on
the
island
of
that
licentious
and
literary
tyrant
whom
a
popular
outburst
had
banished
from
alexandria
another
with
the
head
of
vespasian
and
on
the
obverse
an
outline
of
the
temple
of
venus
at
paphos
attests
the
roman
hospitality
to
the
gods
and
religious
rites
of
all
their
conquered
provinces
upon
the
breaking
up
of
the
roman
world
cyprus
fell
to
the
greek
empire
and
for
centuries
maintained
under
its
ducal
governors
a
sort
of
independent
life
enjoying
as
much
prosperity
as
was
possible
under
the
almost
uniform
imbecility
and
corruption
of
the
byzantine
rule
we
have
already
spoken
of
its
transfer
to
the
lusignans
by
richard
cour
de
lion
and
again
a
romantic
chapter
was
added
to
its
history
by
the
reign
of
queen
catharine
cornaro
who
gave
her
kingdom
to
the
venetian
republic
since
its
final
conquest
by
the
turks
in
cyprus
has
interested
the
world
only
by
its
sufferings
for
turkish
history
here
as
elsewhere
is
little
but
a
record
of
exactions
rapine
and
massacre
from
time
to
time
during
the
present
century
efforts
have
been
made
by
individuals
and
by
learned
societies
to
explore
the
antiquities
of
cyprus
but
although
many
interesting
discoveries
were
made
yet
the
field
was
comparatively
virgin
when
general
di
cesnola
was
appointed
american
consul
in
here
and
there
a
stele
or
some
fragments
of
pottery
or
the
remains
of
a
temple
had
been
unearthed
by
chance
or
by
superficial
search
but
the
few
objects
discovered
served
only
to
pique
curiosity
for
one
reason
or
another
the
efforts
made
to
establish
the
site
of
ancient
cities
had
been
abandoned
the
expeditions
sent
out
by
france
had
been
comparatively
barren
of
results
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
traces
of
the
occupation
of
the
phoenicians
the
egyptians
the
assyrians
the
persians
and
the
romans
were
irrecoverably
concealed
general
di
cesnola
the
explorer
of
cyprus
is
of
a
noble
piedmontese
family
he
received
a
military
and
classical
education
at
turin
identified
with
the
party
of
italian
unity
his
sympathies
were
naturally
excited
by
the
contest
in
america
he
offered
his
sword
to
our
government
and
served
with
distinction
in
the
war
for
the
union
at
its
close
he
was
appointed
consul
at
cyprus
a
position
of
no
pecuniary
attraction
but
i
presume
that
the
new
consul
had
in
view
the
explorations
which
have
given
his
name
such
honorable
celebrity
in
both
hemispheres
the
difficulties
of
his
undertaking
were
many
he
had
to
encounter
at
every
step
the
jealousy
of
the
turkish
government
and
the
fanaticism
and
superstition
of
the
occupants
of
the
soil
archaeological
researches
are
not
easy
in
the
east
under
the
most
favorable
circumstances
and
in
places
where
the
traces
of
ancient
habitations
are
visible
above
ground
and
ancient
sites
are
known
but
in
cyprus
no
ruins
exist
in
sight
to
aid
the
explorer
and
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
localities
no
names
of
ancient
places
are
known
to
the
present
generation
but
the
consul
was
convinced
that
the
great
powers
which
had
from
age
to
age
held
cyprus
must
have
left
some
traces
of
their
occupation
and
that
intelligent
search
would
discover
the
ruins
of
the
prosperous
cities
described
by
strabo
and
mentioned
by
the
geographer
ptolemy
without
other
guides
than
the
descriptions
of
these
and
other
ancient
writers
the
consul
began
his
search
in
and
up
to
he
had
ascertained
the
exact
sites
of
eleven
ancient
cities
mentioned
by
strabo
and
ptolemy
most
of
which
had
ceased
to
exist
before
the
christian
era
and
none
of
which
has
left
vestiges
above
the
soil
in
the
time
of
david
and
of
solomon
the
phoenicians
formed
the
largest
portion
of
the
population
of
the
island
their
royal
cities
of
paphos
amathus
carpassa
citium
and
ammochosto
were
in
the
most
flourishing
condition
not
a
stone
remained
of
them
above
ground
their
sites
were
unknown
in
when
general
di
cesnola
had
satisfied
himself
of
the
probable
site
of
an
ancient
city
or
temple
it
was
difficult
to
obtain
permission
to
dig
even
with
the
authority
of
the
sultan
firman
he
was
obliged
to
wait
for
harvests
to
be
gathered
in
some
cases
to
take
a
lease
of
the
ground
sometimes
the
religious
fanaticism
of
the
occupants
could
not
be
overcome
and
his
working
parties
were
frequently
beaten
and
driven
away
in
his
absence
but
the
consul
exhibited
tact
patience
energy
the
qualities
necessary
with
knowledge
to
a
successful
explorer
he
evaded
or
cast
down
all
obstacles
in
he
discovered
the
necropoli
of
ledra
citium
and
idalium
and
opened
during
three
years
in
these
localities
over
ten
thousand
tombs
bringing
to
light
a
mass
of
ancient
objects
of
art
which
enable
us
to
understand
the
customs
religion
and
civilization
of
the
earlier
inhabitants
idalium
was
famous
of
old
as
the
place
where
grecian
pottery
was
first
made
and
fragments
of
it
have
been
found
from
time
to
time
on
its
site
in
and
he
surveyed
aphrodisium
in
the
northeastern
part
of
the
island
and
ascertained
in
the
interior
the
site
of
golgos
a
city
known
to
have
been
in
existence
before
the
trojan
war
the
disclosures
at
this
place
excited
both
the
wonder
and
the
incredulity
of
the
civilized
world
and
it
was
not
until
the
marvellous
collection
of
the
explorer
was
exhibited
partially
in
london
but
fully
in
new
york
that
the
vast
importance
of
the
labors
of
general
di
cesnola
began
to
be
comprehended
in
exploring
the
necropolis
of
golgos
he
came
a
few
feet
below
the
soil
upon
the
remains
of
the
temple
of
venus
strewn
with
mutilated
sculptures
of
the
highest
interest
supplying
the
missing
link
between
egyptian
and
greek
art
and
indeed
illustrating
the
artistic
condition
of
most
of
the
mediterranean
nations
during
the
period
from
about
to
about
it
would
require
too
much
space
to
tell
how
the
british
museum
missed
and
the
metropolitan
of
new
york
secured
this
first
priceless
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
was
sold
to
a
generous
citizen
of
new
york
john
taylor
johnson
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
sum
which
would
not
compensate
the
explorer
for
his
time
and
labor
and
would
little
more
than
repay
his
pecuniary
outlay
which
reached
the
amount
of
over
sixty
thousand
dollars
in
but
it
was
enough
that
the
treasure
was
secured
by
his
adopted
country
the
loss
of
it
to
the
old
world
which
was
publicly
called
an
misfortune
was
a
piece
of
good
fortune
to
the
united
states
which
time
will
magnify
from
to
the
general
attention
was
directed
to
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
island
and
he
laid
open
the
necropoli
of
marium
paphos
alamas
and
soli
and
three
ancient
cities
whose
names
are
yet
unknown
in
he
explored
and
traced
the
cities
of
throni
leucolla
and
arsinôe
and
the
necropoli
of
several
towns
still
unknown
in
and
he
brought
to
light
the
royal
cities
of
amathus
and
curium
and
located
the
little
town
of
kury
it
would
not
be
possible
here
to
enumerate
all
the
objects
of
art
or
worship
and
of
domestic
use
which
these
excavations
have
yielded
the
statuary
and
the
thousands
of
pieces
of
glass
some
of
them
rivalling
the
most
perfect
grecian
shapes
in
form
and
excelling
the
venetian
colors
in
the
iridescence
of
age
perhaps
attract
most
attention
in
the
metropolitan
museum
from
the
tombs
were
taken
thousands
of
vases
of
earthenware
some
in
alabaster
and
bronze
statuettes
in
arms
coins
scarabæi
cylinders
intaglios
cameos
gold
ornaments
and
mortuary
steles
in
the
temples
were
brought
to
light
inscriptions
architectural
fragments
and
statues
of
the
different
nations
who
have
conquered
and
occupied
the
island
the
inscriptions
are
in
the
egyptian
assyrian
phoenician
greek
and
the
cypriote
languages
the
being
in
the
opinion
of
the
explorer
an
ancient
greek
dialect
at
curium
nineteen
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
ground
were
found
the
remains
of
the
temple
of
apollo
hylates
the
sculptures
contained
in
it
belong
to
the
greek
period
from
to
at
amathus
some
royal
tombs
were
opened
and
two
marble
sarcophagi
of
large
dimensions
one
of
them
intact
were
discovered
which
are
historically
important
and
positive
additions
to
the
remains
of
the
best
greek
art
after
golgos
paleo
paphos
yielded
the
most
interesting
treasures
here
existed
a
temple
to
the
paphian
venus
whose
birthplace
was
in
sight
of
its
portals
famous
throughout
the
east
devotees
and
pilgrims
constantly
resorted
to
it
as
they
do
now
to
the
shrines
of
mecca
and
jerusalem
not
only
the
maritime
adventurers
and
traders
from
asia
minor
and
the
grecian
mainland
crowded
to
the
temple
of
this
pleasing
and
fortunate
goddess
and
quitted
their
vows
or
propitiated
her
favor
by
gifts
but
the
religious
or
the
superstitious
from
persia
and
assyria
and
farthest
egypt
deposited
there
their
votive
offerings
the
collector
of
a
museum
of
antiquity
that
should
illustrate
the
manners
and
religion
of
the
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
could
ask
nothing
better
than
these
deposits
of
many
races
during
many
centuries
in
one
place
the
excavations
at
paphos
were
attended
with
considerable
danger
more
than
once
the
workmen
were
obliged
to
flee
to
save
their
lives
from
the
fanatic
moslems
the
town
although
it
has
lost
its
physical
form
and
even
its
name
its
site
is
now
called
baffo
retains
the
character
of
superstition
it
had
when
paul
found
it
expedient
to
darken
the
vision
of
elymas
there
as
if
a
city
like
a
man
possessed
a
soul
that
outlives
the
body
we
spent
the
afternoon
in
examining
the
new
collection
of
general
di
cesnola
not
so
large
as
that
in
the
metropolitan
museum
but
perhaps
richer
in
some
respects
particularly
in
iridescent
glass
in
the
summer
of
however
the
labors
of
the
indefatigable
explorer
were
crowned
with
a
discovery
the
riches
of
which
cast
into
the
shade
the
real
or
pretended
treasures
of
the
of
priam
discovery
not
certainly
of
more
value
to
art
than
those
that
preceded
it
but
well
calculated
to
excite
popular
wonder
the
finding
of
this
subterranean
hoard
reads
like
an
adventure
of
aladdin
in
pursuing
his
researches
at
curium
on
the
southwestern
side
of
the
island
general
di
cesnola
came
upon
the
site
of
an
ancient
temple
and
uncovered
its
broken
mosaic
pavement
beneath
this
and
at
the
depth
of
feet
he
broke
into
a
subterranean
passage
cut
in
the
rock
this
passage
led
to
a
door
no
genie
sat
by
it
but
it
was
securely
closed
by
a
stone
slab
when
this
was
removed
a
suite
of
four
rooms
was
disclosed
but
they
were
not
immediately
accessible
earth
sifting
through
the
roofs
for
ages
had
filled
them
and
it
required
the
labor
of
a
month
to
clean
out
the
chambers
imagine
the
feverish
enthusiasm
of
the
explorer
as
he
slowly
penetrated
this
where
every
stroke
of
the
pick
disclosed
the
gleam
of
buried
treasure
in
the
first
room
were
found
only
gold
objects
in
the
second
only
silver
and
ornaments
and
utensils
in
the
third
alabasters
vases
and
groups
of
figures
in
the
fourth
bronzes
and
nothing
else
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
discoverer
that
these
four
rooms
were
the
depositories
where
the
crafty
priests
and
priestesses
of
the
old
temple
used
to
hide
their
treasures
during
times
of
war
or
sudden
invasion
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
mysterious
subterranean
passages
and
chambers
in
the
ancient
temples
of
egypt
served
a
similar
purpose
the
treasure
found
scattered
in
these
rooms
did
not
appear
to
be
the
whole
belonging
to
the
temple
but
only
a
part
left
perhaps
in
the
confusion
of
a
hasty
flight
among
the
articles
found
in
the
first
room
dumped
in
a
heap
in
the
middle
as
if
they
had
been
suddenly
in
a
panic
stripped
from
the
altar
in
the
temple
and
cast
into
a
place
of
concealment
were
a
gold
cup
covered
with
egyptian
embossed
work
and
two
bracelets
of
pure
gold
weighing
over
three
pounds
inscribed
with
the
name
of
king
of
this
king
lived
in
and
in
paid
tribute
to
the
assyrian
monarch
assurbanapal
sardanapalus
as
is
recorded
on
an
assyrian
tablet
now
in
the
british
museum
there
were
also
many
gold
necklaces
bracelets
brooches
seals
armlets
in
all
four
hundred
and
eighty
gold
articles
in
the
arranged
on
the
benches
at
the
sides
were
vases
bottles
cups
bowls
bracelets
seals
etc
one
of
the
most
curious
and
valuable
objects
is
a
bowl
having
upon
it
very
fine
embossed
egyptian
work
and
evidently
of
high
antiquity
in
the
third
room
of
vases
and
were
some
most
valuable
and
interesting
specimens
the
yielded
several
high
candelabra
lamps
statuettes
bowls
vases
jugs
patera
fibula
rings
bracelets
mirrors
etc
nearly
all
the
objects
in
the
four
rooms
seem
to
have
been
offerings
and
testify
a
pagan
devotion
to
the
gods
not
excelled
by
christian
generosity
to
the
images
and
shrines
of
modern
worship
the
inscriptions
betoken
the
votive
character
of
these
treasures
that
upon
the
heavy
gold
armlets
is
in
the
genitive
case
and
would
be
literally
translated
regis
paplii
the
words
being
understood
to
precede
it
i
confess
that
the
glitter
of
these
treasures
and
the
glamour
of
these
associations
with
the
ingenious
people
of
antiquity
transformed
the
naked
island
of
cyprus
as
we
lay
off
it
in
the
golden
sunset
into
a
region
of
all
possibilities
and
i
longed
to
take
my
strabo
and
my
spade
and
wander
off
prospecting
for
its
sacred
placers
it
seemed
to
me
when
we
weighed
anchor
at
seven
that
we
were
sailing
away
from
subterranean
passages
stuffed
with
the
curious
treasures
of
antiquity
from
concealed
chambers
in
which
one
if
he
could
only
remove
the
stone
slab
of
the
door
would
pick
up
the
cunning
work
of
the
phoenician
jewellers
the
barbarous
ornaments
of
the
assyrians
the
conceits
in
gold
and
silver
of
the
most
ancient
of
peoples
the
egyptians
summer
at
daylight
next
morning
we
could
just
discern
cyprus
sinking
behind
us
in
the
horizon
the
day
had
all
the
charm
with
which
the
poets
have
invested
this
region
the
sea
was
of
the
traditional
indigo
blue
which
the
blue
grotto
of
capri
is
only
a
cheap
imitation
no
land
was
in
sight
after
we
lost
cyprus
but
the
spirit
of
the
ancient
romance
lay
upon
the
waters
and
we
were
soothed
with
the
delights
of
an
idle
existence
as
good
a
world
as
can
be
made
with
a
perfect
sea
and
a
perfect
sky
and
delicious
atmosphere
we
had
through
this
summer
calm
voyages
our
great
steamer
a
world
in
itself
an
exhibition
a
fair
a
fête
a
cut
loose
from
the
earth
and
set
afloat
there
are
not
less
than
eight
hundred
pilgrims
on
board
people
known
as
and
stowed
in
every
nook
and
corner
forward
of
the
first
cabin
the
deck
of
the
long
vessel
is
packed
with
human
beings
two
deep
and
sometimes
crossed
a
crowd
which
it
is
almost
impossible
to
penetrate
we
look
down
into
the
hold
upon
a
mass
of
bags
and
bundles
and
russians
heaped
indiscriminately
together
it
is
very
difficult
to
distinguish
a
russian
woman
from
a
bundle
of
old
clothes
when
she
is
in
repose
these
people
travel
with
their
bedding
their
babies
and
their
cooking
utensils
and
make
a
home
wherever
they
sit
down
the
forward
passengers
have
overflowed
their
limits
and
extend
back
upon
our
portion
of
the
deck
occupying
all
one
side
of
it
to
the
stern
leaving
the
privileged
class
only
a
narrow
promenade
on
the
starboard
side
these
intruders
are
however
rather
parties
of
them
are
camped
down
in
small
squares
which
become
at
once
miniature
seraglios
one
square
is
occupied
by
wealthy
moslems
from
damascus
and
in
another
is
a
stately
person
who
is
rumored
to
be
the
prince
of
damascus
these
turbaned
and
orientals
have
spread
their
bright
rugs
and
cushions
and
lounge
here
all
day
and
sleep
here
at
night
some
of
them
entertain
themselves
with
chess
but
the
most
of
them
only
smoke
and
talk
little
why
should
they
talk
has
not
enough
already
been
said
in
the
world
at
intervals
during
the
day
ascertaining
i
do
not
know
how
the
direction
of
mecca
these
grave
men
arise
spread
their
and
begin
in
unison
their
kneelings
and
prostrations
servants
and
masters
together
but
the
servants
behind
their
masters
next
to
them
fenced
off
by
benches
is
a
harem
square
occupied
by
veiled
women
perhaps
the
wives
of
these
moslems
and
perhaps
all
the
deck
is
a
study
of
brilliant
costume
a
little
later
the
oriental
prince
turns
out
to
be
only
a
turkish
pasha
who
has
a
below
for
himself
and
another
for
his
harem
but
in
another
compartment
of
our
of
a
deck
is
a
of
damascus
whose
gorgeousness
would
impose
upon
people
more
sophisticated
than
we
no
prince
merchant
like
me
explains
achmed
very
rich
god
be
why
do
you
travel
about
like
that
achmed
and
make
a
fine
display
why
anybody
say
mohammed
achmed
any
more
respect
what
for
i
show
my
rich
take
my
advice
when
i
am
dragoman
i
am
servant
and
dress
here
a
glance
at
his
plain
but
handsome
dragoman
apparel
not
in
monkey
shine
like
remember
jaffa
fierce
like
a
bedawee
i
make
business
when
i
am
by
my
house
that
is
another
the
pasha
has
rooms
below
and
these
contiguous
squares
on
deck
are
occupied
the
one
by
his
suite
and
the
other
by
their
ladies
and
slaves
all
veiled
and
presumably
beautiful
lolling
on
the
cushions
in
the
ennui
that
appears
to
be
their
normal
condition
one
of
them
is
puffing
a
cigarette
under
her
white
veil
at
the
risk
of
a
conflagration
one
of
the
slaves
with
an
olive
complexion
and
dark
eyes
is
very
pretty
and
rather
likes
to
casually
leave
her
face
uncovered
for
the
benefit
of
the
infidels
who
are
about
that
her
feet
and
legs
are
bare
she
cares
still
less
this
harem
is
however
encroached
upon
by
greek
women
who
sprawl
about
with
more
freedom
and
regard
the
world
without
the
hindrance
of
a
veil
if
they
are
not
handsome
they
are
at
least
not
as
you
would
think
women
would
be
in
baggy
silk
trousers
and
embroidered
jackets
in
the
afternoon
we
came
in
sight
of
the
ancient
coasts
of
pamphylia
and
lycia
and
a
lovely
range
of
what
we
took
to
be
the
karamanian
mountains
and
half
hid
in
clouds
all
remote
and
dim
to
our
vision
as
the
historical
pageant
of
assyrian
persian
and
roman
armies
on
these
shores
is
to
our
memory
eastward
on
that
rugged
coast
we
know
is
cilicia
and
the
tarsus
of
paul
and
haroun
al
raschid
the
sunset
on
the
lycian
mountains
was
glorious
the
foot
by
the
water
was
veiled
in
golden
mist
the
sea
sank
from
indigo
to
purple
and
when
the
light
waves
broke
flecks
of
rose
or
blood
flowed
on
the
surface
after
dark
and
before
we
were
abreast
of
old
xanthus
we
descried
the
famous
natural
light
which
is
almost
as
mysterious
to
the
moderns
as
it
was
to
the
ancients
the
handbook
says
of
it
two
miles
from
the
coast
through
a
fertile
plain
and
then
ascending
a
woody
glen
the
traveller
arrives
at
the
zanar
or
volcanic
flame
which
issues
perpetually
from
the
pliny
says
chimaera
near
phaselis
emits
an
unceasing
flame
that
burns
day
and
captain
beaufort
observed
it
from
the
ship
during
the
night
as
a
small
but
steady
light
among
the
hills
we
at
first
mistook
it
for
a
lighthouse
but
it
was
too
high
above
the
water
for
that
and
the
flame
was
too
large
it
was
rather
a
smoky
radiance
than
a
point
of
light
and
yet
it
had
a
dull
red
centre
and
a
duller
luminous
surrounding
we
regarded
with
curiosity
and
some
awe
a
flame
that
had
been
burning
for
over
twenty
centuries
and
perhaps
was
alight
before
the
were
kindled
to
announce
the
fall
of
troy
own
pharos
to
the
ancient
mariners
who
were
without
compass
on
these
treacherous
seas
otherwise
this
classic
coast
is
dark
extinguished
is
the
fire
on
the
altar
of
apollo
at
patera
silent
is
the
winter
oracle
of
this
god
and
desolate
is
the
once
luxurious
metropolis
of
lycia
even
xanthus
the
capital
a
name
disused
by
the
present
inhabitants
has
little
to
show
of
greek
culture
or
persian
possession
and
one
must
seek
the
fragments
of
its
antique
art
in
the
british
museum
coming
on
deck
the
next
morning
at
the
fresh
hour
of
sunrise
i
found
we
were
at
rhodes
we
lay
just
off
the
semicircular
harbor
which
is
clasped
by
shaken
down
by
have
noble
round
towers
at
each
embracing
end
rhodes
is
from
the
sea
one
of
the
most
picturesque
cities
in
the
mediterranean
although
it
has
little
remains
of
that
ancient
splendor
which
caused
strabo
to
prefer
it
to
rome
or
alexandria
the
harbor
wall
which
is
flanked
on
each
side
by
stout
and
round
stone
windmills
extends
up
the
hill
and
becoming
double
surrounds
the
old
town
these
massive
fortifications
of
the
knights
of
john
have
withstood
the
onsets
of
enemies
and
the
tremors
of
the
earth
and
with
the
ancient
moat
excite
the
curiosity
of
this
peaceful
age
of
and
monster
cannon
the
city
ascends
the
slope
of
the
hill
and
passes
beyond
the
wall
outside
and
on
the
right
towards
the
sea
are
a
picturesque
group
of
a
couple
of
dozen
stone
windmills
and
some
minarets
and
a
or
two
higher
up
the
hill
is
sprinkled
a
little
foliage
a
few
and
an
isolated
palm
or
two
and
beyond
the
island
is
only
a
mass
of
broken
bold
rocky
mountains
of
its
miles
of
length
running
southwesterly
from
the
little
point
on
which
the
city
stands
we
can
see
but
little
whether
or
not
rhodes
emerged
from
the
sea
at
the
command
of
apollo
the
greeks
expressed
by
this
tradition
of
its
origin
their
appreciation
of
its
gracious
climate
fertile
soil
and
exquisite
scenery
from
remote
antiquity
it
had
fame
as
a
seat
of
arts
and
letters
and
of
a
vigorous
maritime
power
and
the
romance
of
its
early
centuries
was
equalled
if
not
surpassed
when
it
became
the
residence
of
the
knights
of
john
i
believe
that
the
first
impress
of
its
civilization
was
given
by
the
phoenicians
it
was
the
home
of
the
dorian
race
before
the
time
of
the
trojan
war
and
its
three
cities
were
members
of
the
dorian
hexapolis
it
was
in
fact
a
flourishing
maritime
confederacy
strong
enough
to
send
colonies
to
the
distant
italian
coast
and
sybaris
and
parthenope
modern
naples
perpetuated
the
luxurious
refinement
of
their
founders
the
city
of
rhodes
itself
was
founded
about
four
hundred
years
before
christ
and
the
splendor
of
its
palaces
its
statues
and
paintings
gave
it
a
among
the
most
magnificent
cities
of
the
ancient
world
if
the
earth
of
this
island
could
be
made
to
yield
its
buried
treasures
as
cyprus
has
we
should
doubtless
have
new
proofs
of
the
influence
of
asiatic
civilization
upon
the
greeks
and
be
able
to
trace
in
the
early
doric
arts
and
customs
the
superior
civilization
of
the
phoenicians
and
of
the
masters
of
the
latter
in
science
and
art
the
egyptians
naturally
every
traveller
who
enters
the
harbor
of
rhodes
hopes
to
see
the
site
of
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
the
colossus
he
is
free
to
place
it
on
either
mole
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbor
but
he
comprehends
at
once
that
a
statue
which
was
only
one
hundred
and
five
feet
high
could
never
have
extended
its
legs
across
the
port
the
fame
of
this
colossal
bronze
statue
of
the
sun
is
disproportioned
to
the
period
of
its
existence
it
stood
only
years
after
its
erection
being
shaken
down
by
an
earthquake
in
the
year
and
encumbering
the
ground
with
its
fragments
till
the
advent
of
the
moslem
conquerors
when
we
landed
the
town
was
not
yet
awake
except
the
boatmen
and
the
by
the
the
greek
boatman
whom
we
accepted
as
our
guide
made
an
unsuccessful
excursion
for
bread
finding
only
a
black
uneatable
mixture
sprinkled
with
aromatic
seeds
but
we
sat
under
the
shelter
of
an
old
sycamore
in
a
lovely
place
by
the
shore
and
sipped
our
coffee
and
saw
the
sun
coming
over
lycia
and
shining
on
the
old
towers
and
walls
of
the
knights
passing
from
the
quay
through
a
highly
ornamented
gothic
gateway
we
ascended
the
famous
historic
street
still
called
the
street
of
the
knights
the
massive
houses
of
which
have
withstood
the
shocks
of
earthquakes
and
the
devastation
of
saracenic
and
turkish
occupation
at
this
hour
the
street
was
as
deserted
as
it
was
three
centuries
and
a
half
ago
when
the
knights
sorrowfully
sailed
out
of
the
harbor
in
search
of
a
new
home
their
four
months
defence
of
the
against
the
overwhelming
force
of
suleiman
the
magnificent
added
a
new
lustre
to
their
valor
and
extorted
the
admiration
of
the
victor
and
the
most
honorable
terms
of
surrender
with
them
departed
the
prosperity
of
rhodes
this
street
of
whose
palaces
we
have
heard
so
much
is
not
imposing
it
is
not
wide
its
solid
stone
houses
are
only
two
stories
high
and
their
fronts
are
now
disfigured
by
cheap
arab
balconies
but
the
façades
are
gray
with
age
all
along
are
remains
of
carved
windows
gothic
sculptured
doorways
and
shields
and
coats
of
arms
crosses
and
armorial
legends
are
set
in
the
walls
partially
defaced
by
time
and
accident
for
the
moslems
apparently
inheriting
the
respect
of
suleiman
for
the
knights
have
spared
the
mementos
of
their
faith
and
prowess
i
saw
no
inscriptions
that
are
intact
but
made
out
upon
one
shield
the
words
voluntas
mei
est
the
carving
is
all
beautiful
we
went
through
the
silent
streets
waking
only
echoes
of
the
past
out
to
the
ruins
of
the
once
elegant
church
of
john
which
was
shaken
down
by
a
some
thirty
years
ago
and
utterly
flattened
by
an
earthquake
some
years
afterwards
outside
the
ramparts
we
met
and
saluted
frith
the
freedom
of
travellers
a
gorgeous
turk
who
was
taking
the
morning
air
and
whom
our
guide
in
bated
breath
said
was
the
governor
in
this
part
of
the
town
is
the
mosque
of
suleiman
in
the
portal
are
two
lovely
marble
columns
rich
with
age
the
lintels
are
exquisitely
carved
with
flowers
arms
casques
musical
instruments
the
crossed
sword
and
the
torch
and
the
mandolin
perhaps
the
emblem
of
some
troubadour
knight
wherever
we
went
we
found
bits
of
old
carving
remains
of
columns
sections
of
battlemented
roofs
the
town
is
saturated
with
the
old
knights
near
the
mosque
is
a
foundation
of
charity
a
public
kitchen
at
which
the
poor
were
fed
or
were
free
to
come
and
cook
their
food
it
is
in
decay
now
and
the
rooks
were
sailing
about
its
old
chimneys
there
are
no
hellenic
remains
in
the
city
and
the
only
remembrance
of
that
past
which
we
searched
for
was
the
antique
coin
which
has
upon
one
side
the
head
of
medusa
and
upon
the
other
the
rose
rhoda
which
gave
the
town
its
name
the
town
was
quiet
but
in
pursuit
of
this
coin
in
the
jews
quarter
we
started
up
swarms
of
traders
were
sent
from
isaac
to
jacob
and
invaded
dark
shops
and
private
houses
where
jewish
women
and
children
were
just
beginning
to
complain
of
the
morning
light
our
guide
was
a
jolly
greek
who
was
willing
to
awaken
the
whole
town
in
search
of
a
silver
coin
the
traders
when
we
had
routed
them
out
had
little
to
show
in
the
way
of
antiquities
perhaps
the
best
representative
of
the
modern
manufactures
of
rhodes
is
the
wooden
shoe
which
is
in
form
like
the
damascus
clog
but
is
inlaid
with
more
taste
the
people
whom
we
encountered
in
our
morning
walk
were
greeks
or
jews
the
morning
atmosphere
was
delicious
and
we
could
well
believe
that
the
climate
of
rhodes
is
the
finest
in
the
mediterranean
and
also
that
it
is
the
least
exciting
of
cities
it
always
so
peaceful
here
we
asked
the
guide
if
you
please
said
he
happened
here
since
the
nothing
in
the
is
the
town
as
healthy
as
they
say
the
town
is
certainly
clean
if
it
is
in
decay
in
one
street
we
found
a
row
of
down
the
centre
but
they
were
half
decayed
like
the
street
i
shall
always
think
of
rhodes
as
a
silent
city
in
the
jews
quarter
where
the
hope
of
selling
an
old
coin
set
the
whole
hive
humming
i
suspect
that
is
its
normal
condition
the
ægean
islands
our
sail
all
day
among
the
ægean
islands
was
surpassingly
lovely
our
course
was
constantly
changing
to
wind
among
them
their
beautiful
outlines
and
the
soft
atmosphere
that
enwrapped
them
disposed
us
to
regard
them
in
the
light
of
homeric
history
and
we
did
not
struggle
against
the
illusion
they
are
all
treeless
and
for
the
most
part
have
scant
traces
of
vegetation
except
a
thin
green
grass
which
seems
rather
a
color
than
a
substance
here
are
the
little
islands
of
chalce
and
syme
once
seats
of
grecian
culture
now
the
abode
of
a
few
thousand
we
pass
telos
and
nisyros
which
was
once
ruled
by
queen
artemisia
and
had
its
share
in
the
fortunes
of
the
wars
of
athens
and
sparta
it
is
a
small
round
mass
of
rock
but
it
rises
hundred
feet
out
of
the
sea
and
its
volcanic
soil
is
favorable
to
the
grape
opposite
is
the
site
of
the
ruins
of
cnidus
a
dorian
city
of
great
renown
and
famous
for
its
shrine
of
venus
and
her
statue
by
praxiteles
we
get
an
idea
of
the
indentation
of
this
coast
of
asia
minor
and
its
consequent
accessibility
to
early
settlement
and
civilization
from
the
fact
that
cnidus
is
situated
on
a
very
narrow
peninsula
ninety
miles
long
kos
is
celebrated
not
only
for
its
size
loveliness
and
fertility
but
as
the
birthplace
of
apelles
and
of
hippocrates
the
inhabitants
still
venerate
an
enormous
under
which
the
good
physician
is
said
to
have
dispensed
his
knowledge
of
healing
the
city
of
kos
is
on
a
fine
plain
which
gradually
slopes
from
the
mountain
to
the
sea
and
is
well
covered
with
trees
the
attractive
town
lies
prettily
along
the
shore
and
is
distinguished
by
a
massive
square
mediaeval
fortress
and
by
round
stone
windmills
with
specially
long
arms
as
we
came
around
the
corner
of
kos
we
had
a
view
distant
but
interesting
of
the
site
of
halicarnassus
the
modern
town
of
boudroum
with
its
splendid
fortress
which
the
turks
wrested
from
the
knights
of
john
we
sail
by
it
with
regret
for
the
student
and
traveller
in
the
east
comes
to
have
a
tender
feeling
for
the
simple
nature
of
the
father
of
history
and
would
forego
some
other
pleasant
experiences
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
birthplace
of
herodotus
here
also
was
born
the
historian
dionysius
and
here
a
few
years
ago
were
identified
the
exact
site
and
rescued
the
remains
of
another
of
the
seven
wonders
the
tomb
of
mausolus
built
in
honor
of
her
husband
by
the
carian
artemisia
who
sustained
to
him
the
double
relation
of
sister
and
queen
this
monument
which
exhibited
the
perfection
of
greek
art
was
four
hundred
and
eleven
feet
in
circumference
and
one
hundred
and
forty
feet
high
it
consisted
of
a
round
building
surrounded
by
columns
surmounted
by
a
pyramid
and
upon
the
latter
stood
a
colossal
group
of
a
chariot
and
four
horses
some
of
the
beautiful
sculpture
of
this
mausoleum
can
be
seen
in
the
british
museum
we
were
all
the
afternoon
endeavoring
to
get
sight
of
patinos
which
the
intervening
islands
hid
from
view
every
some
one
was
discovering
it
and
announcing
the
fact
no
doubt
half
the
passengers
will
go
to
their
graves
comforted
by
the
belief
that
they
saw
it
some
of
them
actually
did
have
a
glimpse
of
it
towards
night
between
the
islands
of
lipso
and
arki
it
is
a
larger
island
than
we
expected
to
see
and
as
we
had
understood
that
the
revelations
were
written
on
a
small
rocky
island
in
fact
a
mere
piece
of
rock
the
feat
seemed
less
difficult
on
a
island
its
height
is
now
crowned
by
the
celebrated
monastery
of
john
but
the
island
is
as
barren
and
uninviting
as
it
was
when
the
romans
used
it
as
a
place
of
banishment
we
passed
astypatæa
kalyminos
leros
and
a
sprinkling
of
islets
as
if
a
giant
had
sown
this
sea
with
rocks
each
of
which
has
a
history
or
is
graced
by
a
legend
but
their
glory
is
of
the
past
the
chief
support
of
their
poor
inhabitants
is
now
the
at
sunset
we
had
before
us
icaria
and
samos
and
on
the
mainland
the
site
of
miletus
now
a
place
whose
vast
theatre
is
almost
the
sole
remains
of
the
metropolis
of
the
ionic
confederacy
perhaps
the
centre
of
ionic
art
and
culture
was
however
the
island
of
samos
but
i
doubt
not
the
fame
of
its
samian
wine
has
carried
its
name
further
than
the
exploits
of
its
warriors
the
works
of
its
artists
or
the
thoughts
of
its
philosophers
it
was
the
birthplace
of
pythagoras
it
was
once
governed
by
polycrates
there
for
a
time
antony
and
cleopatra
established
their
court
of
love
and
luxury
in
the
evening
we
sailed
close
under
its
high
cliffs
and
saw
dimly
opposite
icaria
whose
only
merit
or
interest
lies
in
its
association
with
the
aerial
voyage
of
icarus
the
soil
of
daedalus
although
the
voyager
amid
these
islands
and
along
this
historic
coast
profoundly
feels
the
influence
of
the
past
and
as
he
reads
and
looks
and
reflects
becomes
saturated
with
its
and
delicious
romance
he
is
nevertheless
scarcely
able
to
believe
that
these
denuded
shores
and
purple
rocky
islets
were
the
homes
of
heroes
the
theatres
of
exploits
the
seats
of
wealth
and
luxury
and
power
that
the
marble
of
splendid
temples
gleamed
from
every
summit
and
headland
that
rich
cities
clustered
on
every
island
and
studded
the
mainland
and
that
this
region
bounteous
in
the
fruits
of
the
liberal
earth
was
not
less
prolific
in
vigorous
men
and
beautiful
women
who
planted
adventurous
and
remote
colonies
and
sowed
around
the
mediterranean
the
seeds
of
our
modern
civilization
in
the
present
desolation
and
soft
decay
it
is
difficult
to
recall
the
wealth
the
diversified
industry
the
martial
spirit
the
refinement
of
the
races
whose
art
and
literature
are
still
our
emulation
and
despair
here
indeed
were
the
beginnings
of
our
era
of
our
modern
life
by
a
great
gulf
from
the
ancient
civilization
of
the
nile
life
of
the
people
the
attempts
at
the
individual
adventure
the
new
development
of
human
relations
consequent
upon
commerce
and
the
freer
exchange
of
products
and
ideas
what
these
islands
and
this
variegated
and
genial
coast
of
asia
minor
might
become
under
a
government
that
did
not
paralyze
effort
and
rob
industry
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
the
impression
is
made
upon
the
traveller
that
nature
herself
is
exhausted
in
these
regions
and
that
it
will
need
the
rest
or
change
of
a
geologic
era
to
restore
her
pristine
vigor
the
prodigality
and
avarice
of
thousands
of
years
have
left
the
that
the
flame
of
civilization
has
burned
the
crater
of
an
extinct
volcano
but
probably
it
is
society
and
not
nature
that
is
dead
the
island
of
rhodes
for
an
example
might
in
a
few
years
of
culture
again
produce
the
forests
that
once
supplied
her
hardy
sons
with
fleets
of
vessels
and
her
genial
soil
under
any
intelligent
agriculture
would
yield
abundant
harvests
the
land
is
now
divided
into
petty
holdings
and
each
poor
proprietor
scratches
it
just
enough
to
make
it
yield
a
scanty
return
during
the
night
the
steamer
had
come
to
chios
scio
and
i
rose
at
dawn
to
we
had
no
opportunity
to
spot
almost
equally
famous
as
the
birthplace
of
homer
and
the
land
of
the
chian
wine
the
town
lies
along
the
water
for
a
mile
or
more
around
a
shallow
bay
opening
to
the
east
a
city
of
small
white
houses
relieved
by
a
minaret
or
two
close
to
the
water
edge
are
some
edifices
and
in
front
is
an
ancient
square
fort
which
has
a
mole
extending
into
the
water
terminated
by
a
mediaeval
bastion
behind
which
small
vessels
find
shelter
low
by
the
shore
on
the
north
are
some
of
the
sturdy
windmills
peculiar
to
these
islands
and
i
can
distinguish
with
a
glass
a
few
fragments
of
byzantine
and
mediaeval
architecture
among
the
common
buildings
staring
at
us
from
the
middle
of
the
town
were
two
big
signs
with
the
word
to
the
south
of
the
town
amid
a
grove
of
trees
are
the
white
stones
of
the
cemetery
the
city
of
the
dead
is
nearly
as
large
as
that
of
the
living
behind
the
city
are
orange
orchards
and
many
a
bright
spot
of
verdure
but
the
space
for
it
is
not
broad
sharp
bare
serrated
perpendicular
ridges
of
mountain
rise
behind
the
town
encircling
it
like
an
amphitheatre
in
the
morning
light
these
mountains
are
tawny
and
rich
in
color
tinged
with
purple
and
red
chios
is
a
pretty
picture
in
the
shelter
of
these
hills
which
gather
for
it
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
it
is
now
half
a
century
since
the
name
of
scio
rang
through
the
civilized
world
as
the
theatre
of
a
deed
which
turkish
history
itself
can
scarcely
parallel
and
the
island
is
vigorously
regaining
its
prosperity
it
only
needs
to
recall
the
outlines
of
the
story
the
fertile
island
which
is
four
times
the
extent
of
the
isle
of
wight
was
the
home
of
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
inhabitants
of
whom
only
six
thousand
were
turks
the
greeks
of
scio
were
said
to
differ
physically
and
morally
from
all
their
kindred
their
merchants
were
princes
at
home
and
abroad
art
and
literature
flourished
with
grace
and
refinement
of
manner
and
there
probably
nowhere
existed
a
society
more
industrious
gay
contented
and
intelligent
tempted
by
some
adventurers
from
samos
to
rebel
they
drew
down
upon
themselves
the
vengeance
of
the
turks
who
retaliated
the
bloody
massacre
of
turkish
men
women
and
children
by
the
insurrectionists
with
a
universal
destruction
the
city
of
scio
with
its
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
and
seventy
villages
were
reduced
to
ashes
thousand
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
were
slain
thousand
were
carried
away
as
slaves
among
them
women
and
children
who
had
been
reared
in
luxury
and
most
of
the
remainder
escaped
in
a
destitute
state
into
other
parts
of
greece
at
the
end
of
the
summer
harvest
of
death
only
two
thousand
sciotes
were
left
on
the
island
an
apologist
for
the
turks
could
only
urge
that
the
greeks
would
have
been
as
unmerciful
under
like
circumstances
none
of
the
passengers
were
up
to
see
chios
one
for
poor
homer
sake
but
the
were
stirring
for
their
own
crawling
out
of
their
comfortables
giving
the
babies
a
turn
and
the
vigilant
flea
a
taste
of
the
morning
air
when
the
russian
peasant
who
sleeps
in
the
high
truncated
frieze
cap
and
in
the
coat
which
he
wore
in
jerusalem
garment
short
in
the
waist
gathered
in
pleats
underneath
the
shoulders
and
falling
in
stiff
expanding
folds
below
he
first
gets
up
and
rubs
his
eyes
he
is
an
astonished
being
his
wife
is
already
astir
and
beginning
to
collect
the
materials
of
breakfast
some
of
the
greeks
are
making
coffee
there
is
a
smell
of
coffee
and
there
are
various
other
unanalyzed
odors
but
for
pilgrims
and
pilgrims
so
closely
packed
that
no
one
can
stir
without
moving
the
entire
mass
these
are
much
cleaner
than
they
might
be
expected
to
be
and
cleaner
indeed
than
they
can
continue
to
be
and
keep
up
their
reputation
and
yet
half
an
hour
among
them
looking
out
from
the
bow
for
a
comprehensive
view
of
chios
is
quite
enough
i
wished
then
that
these
people
would
change
either
their
religion
or
their
clothes
last
night
we
had
singing
on
deck
by
an
extemporized
quartette
of
young
americans
with
harmonious
and
voices
and
it
was
a
most
delightful
contrast
to
the
caterwauling
accompanied
by
the
darabouka
which
we
constantly
hear
on
the
forward
deck
and
which
the
arabs
call
singing
even
the
fat
little
moslem
from
damascus
who
lives
in
the
pen
with
the
of
that
city
listened
with
delight
and
declared
that
it
was
tyeb
kateer
who
knows
but
these
people
who
are
always
singing
have
some
appreciation
of
music
after
all
and
ephesus
when
we
left
chios
we
sailed
at
first
east
right
into
the
sun
gradually
turned
north
and
rounded
the
promontory
of
the
mainland
and
then
east
by
south
came
into
the
beautiful
landlocked
bay
of
smyrna
in
which
the
blue
water
changes
into
a
muddy
green
at
length
we
passed
on
the
right
a
turkish
fortress
which
appeared
as
formidable
as
a
bathing
establishment
and
smyrna
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
circling
the
shore
houses
and
hills
beyond
the
wind
was
north
as
it
always
is
here
in
the
morning
and
the
landing
was
difficult
we
had
the
usual
excitement
of
swarming
boats
and
clamorous
boatmen
and
lively
waves
one
passenger
went
into
the
water
instead
of
the
boat
but
was
easily
fished
out
by
his
baggy
trousers
and
as
he
was
a
greek
pilgrim
it
was
thought
that
a
little
water
would
injure
him
coming
to
the
shore
we
climbed
with
difficulty
out
of
the
bobbing
boat
upon
the
the
shiftless
turkish
government
will
do
nothing
to
improve
the
landing
at
this
great
port
the
sultan
can
borrow
any
money
he
builds
a
new
palace
on
the
bosphorus
or
an
ironclad
to
anchor
in
front
of
it
smyrna
may
be
said
to
have
a
character
of
its
own
in
not
having
any
character
of
its
own
one
of
the
most
ancient
cities
on
the
globe
it
has
no
appearance
of
antiquity
containing
all
nationalities
it
has
no
nationality
the
second
commercial
city
of
the
east
it
has
no
chamber
of
commerce
no
bourse
no
commercial
unity
its
citizens
are
of
no
country
and
have
no
impulse
of
patriotism
it
is
an
asiatic
city
with
a
european
face
it
produces
nothing
it
exchanges
everything
fabrics
of
europe
the
luxuries
of
the
orient
the
children
of
the
east
are
sent
to
its
schools
but
it
has
no
literary
character
nor
any
influence
of
culture
it
is
hospitable
to
all
religions
and
conspicuous
for
none
it
is
the
paradise
of
the
turks
the
home
of
luxury
and
of
beautiful
women
but
it
is
also
a
favorite
of
the
mosquito
and
until
recently
it
has
been
the
yearly
camp
of
the
plague
it
is
not
the
most
healthful
city
in
the
world
and
yet
it
is
the
metropolis
of
the
smyrna
can
be
compared
to
damascus
in
its
age
and
in
its
perpetuity
under
all
discouragements
and
changes
shocks
of
earthquakes
the
constant
visitations
of
pestilence
and
the
rule
of
a
hundred
masters
it
was
a
great
city
before
the
migration
of
the
ionians
into
asia
minor
it
saw
the
rise
and
fall
of
sardis
it
was
restored
from
a
paralysis
of
four
centuries
by
alexander
under
all
vicissitudes
it
seems
to
have
retained
its
character
of
a
great
mart
of
exchange
a
necessity
for
the
trade
of
asia
and
perhaps
the
indifference
of
its
conglomerate
inhabitants
to
freedom
and
to
creeds
contributed
to
its
safety
certainly
it
thrived
as
well
under
the
christians
when
it
was
the
seat
of
one
of
the
seven
churches
as
it
did
under
the
romans
when
it
was
a
seat
of
a
great
school
of
sophists
and
rhetoricians
and
it
is
equally
prosperous
under
the
sway
of
the
successor
of
mohammed
during
the
thousand
years
of
the
always
decaying
byzantine
empire
it
had
its
share
of
misfortunes
and
its
walls
alternately
at
a
later
day
displayed
the
star
and
crescent
and
the
equal
arms
of
the
cross
of
john
yet
in
all
its
history
i
seem
to
see
the
trading
gay
free
but
not
disorderly
smyrna
passing
on
its
even
way
of
traffic
and
of
pleasure
of
its
two
hundred
thousand
and
more
inhabitants
about
ninety
thousand
are
rayah
greeks
and
about
eighty
thousand
are
turks
there
is
a
changing
population
of
perhaps
a
thousand
europeans
there
are
large
bodies
of
jews
and
armenians
and
it
was
recently
estimated
to
have
as
many
as
fifteen
thousand
levantines
these
latter
are
the
descendants
of
the
marriage
of
europeans
with
greek
and
jewish
women
and
whatever
moral
reputation
the
levantines
enjoy
in
the
levant
the
women
of
this
mixture
are
famous
for
their
beauty
but
the
race
is
said
to
be
not
and
is
yielding
to
the
original
types
the
languages
spoken
in
smyrna
are
turkish
a
greek
dialect
the
romaic
spanish
italian
trench
english
and
arabic
probably
prevailing
in
the
order
named
our
own
steamer
was
much
more
oriental
than
the
city
of
smyrna
as
soon
as
we
stepped
ashore
we
seemed
to
have
come
into
a
european
city
the
people
almost
all
wear
the
frank
dress
the
shops
offer
little
that
is
peculiar
one
who
was
unfamiliar
with
bazaars
might
wonder
at
the
tangle
of
various
lanes
but
we
saw
nothing
calling
for
comment
a
walk
through
the
jewish
quarter
here
as
everywhere
else
the
dirtiest
and
most
picturesque
in
the
city
will
reward
the
philosophic
traveller
with
the
sight
of
lovely
women
lolling
at
every
window
it
is
not
the
fashion
for
smyrniote
ladies
to
promenade
the
streets
but
they
mercifully
array
themselves
in
full
toilet
and
stand
in
their
doorways
the
programme
of
the
voyage
of
the
achille
promised
us
a
day
and
a
half
in
smyrna
which
would
give
us
time
to
visit
ephesus
we
were
due
friday
noon
we
did
not
arrive
till
saturday
noon
this
vexatious
delay
had
caused
much
agitation
on
board
to
be
cheated
out
of
ephesus
was
an
outrage
which
the
tourists
could
not
submit
to
they
had
come
this
way
on
purpose
to
see
ephesus
they
would
rather
give
up
anything
else
in
the
east
the
captain
said
he
had
no
discretion
he
must
sail
at
the
passengers
then
prepared
a
handsome
petition
to
the
agent
begging
him
to
detain
the
steamer
till
eight
in
order
to
permit
them
to
visit
ephesus
by
a
special
train
there
is
a
proclivity
in
all
those
who
can
write
to
sign
any
and
every
thing
except
a
subscription
paper
and
this
petition
received
eager
and
signatures
the
agent
at
smyrna
plumply
refused
our
request
with
unnecessary
surliness
but
upon
the
arrival
of
the
captain
and
a
consultation
which
no
doubt
had
more
reference
to
freight
than
to
the
petition
the
official
agreed
as
a
special
favor
to
detain
the
steamer
till
eight
but
not
a
moment
longer
we
hastened
to
the
station
of
the
aidin
railway
which
runs
eighty
miles
to
aidin
the
ancient
tralles
a
rich
lydian
metropolis
of
immemorial
foundation
the
modern
town
has
perhaps
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
and
is
a
depot
for
cotton
and
figs
that
sweetmeat
of
paradise
the
halva
is
manufactured
there
and
its
great
tanneries
produce
fine
yellow
morocco
leather
the
town
lies
only
three
miles
from
the
famous
tortuous
mæander
and
all
the
region
about
it
is
a
garden
of
vines
and
the
railway
company
is
under
english
management
which
signifies
promptness
and
the
special
train
was
ready
in
ten
minutes
when
lo
of
the
devotees
of
ephesus
only
eleven
appeared
we
were
off
at
once
good
engine
solid
track
clean
elegant
comfortable
carnages
as
we
moved
out
of
the
city
the
air
was
full
of
the
odor
of
we
crossed
the
meles
and
sped
down
a
valley
very
fertile
smiling
with
green
meadows
groves
of
midberry
oranges
figs
with
blue
hills
ancient
mount
olympus
beyond
which
lay
green
sardis
in
the
distance
a
country
as
lovely
and
as
an
english
or
american
we
had
seen
nothing
so
luxuriant
and
thriving
in
the
east
before
the
hills
indeed
were
stripped
of
trees
but
clad
on
the
tops
with
verdure
the
result
of
plentiful
rains
we
went
the
usual
time
of
trains
is
three
hours
we
ran
over
the
fifty
miles
in
an
hour
and
a
quarter
we
could
hardly
believe
our
senses
that
we
were
in
a
luxurious
carriage
flying
along
at
this
rate
in
asia
and
going
to
ephesus
while
we
were
confessing
that
the
lazy
swing
of
the
carriage
was
more
agreeable
than
that
of
the
donkey
or
the
dromedary
the
train
pulled
up
at
station
ayasolook
once
the
residence
of
the
sultans
of
ayasolook
and
the
camp
of
tamerlane
now
a
cluster
of
coffeehouses
and
with
a
few
inhabitants
who
prey
upon
travellers
not
with
oriental
courtesy
but
with
european
insolence
on
our
right
was
a
round
hill
surmounted
by
a
roman
castle
from
the
hills
on
the
left
striding
across
the
railway
towards
ephesus
were
the
tall
stone
pillars
of
a
roman
aqueduct
the
brick
arches
and
conductor
nearly
all
fallen
away
on
the
summit
of
nearly
every
pillar
a
white
stork
had
built
from
sticks
and
grass
a
high
round
nest
which
covered
the
top
and
the
bird
stood
in
it
motionless
a
beautiful
object
at
that
height
against
the
sky
the
station
people
had
not
obeyed
our
telegram
to
furnish
enough
horses
and
those
of
us
who
were
obliged
to
walk
congratulated
ourselves
on
the
mistake
since
the
way
was
as
rough
as
the
steeds
the
path
led
over
a
ground
full
of
stone
débris
this
was
the
site
of
ayasolook
which
had
been
built
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
old
city
most
picturesque
objects
were
the
small
and
minarets
which
revived
here
the
most
graceful
forms
and
fancies
of
saracenic
art
one
i
noticed
which
had
the
ideal
persian
arch
and
slender
columns
nature
herself
had
taken
into
loving
care
and
draped
with
clinging
green
and
hanging
vines
there
were
towers
of
brick
to
which
age
has
given
a
rich
tone
flaring
at
the
top
in
a
curve
that
fascinated
the
eye
on
each
tomb
tower
and
minaret
the
storks
had
nested
and
upon
each
stood
the
mother
looking
down
upon
her
brood
about
the
crumbling
sides
of
a
tower
thus
draped
and
crowned
innumerable
swallows
had
built
their
nests
so
that
it
was
alive
with
birds
whose
cheerful
occupation
gave
a
kind
of
pathos
to
the
human
desertion
and
decay
behind
the
roman
castle
stands
the
great
but
ruinous
mosque
of
sultan
selim
which
was
formerly
the
church
of
john
we
did
not
turn
aside
for
its
empty
glory
but
to
the
theologian
or
the
student
of
the
formation
of
christian
dogmas
and
of
the
gladiatorial
spectacles
of
an
ancient
convocation
there
are
few
arenas
in
the
east
more
interesting
than
this
for
in
this
church
it
is
supposed
were
held
the
two
councils
of
and
john
after
his
release
from
patmos
passed
the
remainder
of
his
life
here
the
virgin
mary
followed
him
to
the
city
so
favored
by
the
presence
of
the
first
apostles
and
here
she
died
and
was
buried
from
her
entombment
ephesus
for
a
long
time
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
the
city
of
the
virgin
until
that
honor
was
transferred
to
jerusalem
where
however
her
empty
tomb
soon
necessitated
her
resurrection
and
assumption
subject
which
inspired
so
many
artists
after
the
revival
of
learning
in
europe
in
the
hill
near
this
church
mary
magdalene
was
buried
in
ephesus
also
reposed
the
body
of
timothy
its
first
bishop
this
church
of
john
was
at
some
distance
from
the
heart
of
the
city
which
lay
in
the
plain
to
the
south
and
near
the
sea
but
in
the
fifth
century
ephesus
was
a
city
of
churches
the
reader
needs
to
remember
that
in
that
century
the
christian
controversy
had
passed
from
the
nature
of
the
trinity
to
the
incarnation
and
that
the
first
council
of
ephesus
was
called
by
the
emperor
theodosius
in
the
hope
of
establishing
the
opinion
of
the
syrian
nestorius
the
primate
of
constantinople
who
refused
to
give
to
the
mother
of
christ
the
title
then
come
into
use
of
the
mother
of
god
and
discriminated
nicely
the
two
natures
of
the
saviour
his
views
were
anathematized
by
cyril
the
patriarch
of
alexandria
and
the
dispute
involved
the
entire
east
in
a
fierce
contest
in
the
council
convened
of
greek
bishops
nestorius
had
no
doubt
but
he
would
be
sustained
by
the
weight
of
authority
but
the
prompt
cyril
whose
qualities
would
have
found
a
conspicuous
and
useful
theatre
at
the
head
of
a
roman
army
against
the
scythians
was
first
on
the
ground
with
an
abundance
of
spiritual
and
temporal
arms
in
reading
of
this
council
one
recalls
without
effort
the
once
famous
and
now
historical
conventions
of
the
democratic
party
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
days
when
political
salvation
offered
in
the
creeds
of
the
and
of
the
shells
was
enforced
by
the
attendance
of
gangs
of
and
boys
who
understood
the
use
of
against
heretical
opinions
it
is
true
that
nestorius
had
in
reserve
behind
his
prelates
the
stout
slaves
of
the
bath
of
zeuxippus
but
cyril
had
secured
the
alliance
of
the
bishop
of
ephesus
and
the
support
of
the
rabble
of
peasants
and
slaves
who
were
easily
excited
to
jealousy
for
the
honor
of
the
virgin
of
their
city
and
he
landed
from
egypt
with
his
great
retinue
of
bishops
a
band
of
merciless
monks
of
the
nile
of
fanatics
mariners
and
slaves
who
took
a
ready
interest
in
the
theological
discussions
of
those
days
the
council
met
in
this
church
surrounded
by
the
fierce
if
not
martial
array
of
cyril
deliberations
were
begun
before
the
arrival
of
the
most
weighty
supporters
of
nestorius
cyril
anticipated
the
slow
approach
of
john
of
antioch
and
his
bishops
in
one
day
the
primate
of
constantinople
was
hastily
deposed
and
cursed
together
with
his
heresy
upon
the
arrival
of
john
he
also
formed
a
council
which
deposed
and
cursed
the
opposite
party
and
heresy
and
for
three
months
ephesus
was
a
scene
of
clamor
and
bloodshed
the
cathedral
was
garrisoned
the
churches
were
shut
against
the
nestorians
the
imperial
troops
assaulted
them
and
were
repelled
the
whole
city
was
thrown
into
a
turmoil
by
the
encounters
of
the
rival
factions
each
council
hurled
its
anathemas
at
the
other
and
peace
was
only
restored
by
the
dissolution
of
the
council
by
command
of
the
emperor
the
second
session
in
the
year
was
shorter
and
more
decisive
it
made
quick
work
of
the
heresy
of
nestorius
africa
added
to
its
delegation
of
bullies
and
fanatics
a
band
of
archers
the
heresy
of
the
two
natures
was
condemned
and
anathematized
those
who
divide
christ
be
divided
with
the
sword
may
they
be
hewn
in
pieces
may
they
be
burned
alive
the
scene
in
the
cathedral
ended
in
a
mob
of
monks
and
soldiers
who
trampled
upon
flavian
the
then
primate
of
constantinople
so
that
in
three
days
thereafter
he
died
of
his
wounds
it
is
as
difficult
to
make
real
now
upon
this
spot
those
fierce
theologic
wars
of
ephesus
as
it
is
the
fabled
exploits
of
bacchus
and
hercules
and
the
amazons
in
this
valley
to
believe
that
here
were
born
apollo
and
diana
and
that
hither
fled
latona
and
that
great
pan
lurked
in
its
groves
we
presently
came
upon
the
site
of
the
great
temple
of
diana
recently
identified
by
wood
we
encountered
on
our
way
a
cluster
of
stone
huts
wretched
habitations
of
the
only
representatives
of
the
renowned
capital
before
us
was
a
plain
broken
by
small
hillocks
and
mounds
and
strewn
with
cut
and
fractured
stone
the
site
of
the
temple
can
be
briefly
and
accurately
described
as
a
rectangular
excavation
perhaps
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
wide
by
three
hundred
long
and
twelve
feet
deep
with
two
feet
of
water
in
it
out
of
which
rises
a
stump
of
a
column
of
granite
and
another
of
marble
and
two
bases
of
marble
round
this
hole
are
heaps
of
fractured
stone
and
marble
in
this
excavation
wood
found
the
statue
of
diana
which
we
may
hope
is
the
ancient
sacred
image
guarded
by
the
priests
as
the
most
precious
treasure
of
the
temple
and
imposed
upon
the
credulity
of
men
as
this
is
all
that
remains
of
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
temple
whose
fame
is
second
to
none
in
antiquity
a
temple
seven
times
burned
and
eight
times
built
and
always
with
increased
magnificence
a
temple
whose
origin
referable
doubtless
to
the
cyclopean
builders
of
this
coast
can
not
be
less
than
fifteen
hundred
years
before
our
era
a
temple
which
still
had
its
votaries
and
its
rites
in
the
fourth
century
we
picked
up
a
bit
of
marble
from
its
ruins
as
a
to
memory
and
imagination
but
we
went
our
way
utterly
unable
to
conceive
that
there
ever
existed
any
such
person
as
great
diana
of
the
ephesians
we
directed
our
steps
over
the
plain
to
the
hill
pion
i
suppose
pion
may
have
been
the
acropolis
of
ephesus
the
spot
of
the
earliest
settlement
and
on
it
and
around
it
clustered
many
of
the
temples
and
public
buildings
the
reader
will
recall
argos
and
athens
and
corinth
and
a
dozen
other
cities
of
antiquity
for
which
nature
furnished
in
the
midst
of
a
plain
such
a
convenient
and
easily
defended
on
our
way
thither
we
walked
amid
mounds
that
form
a
street
of
tombs
many
of
the
sarcophagi
are
still
in
place
and
little
injured
but
we
explore
the
ground
with
caution
for
it
is
full
of
pitfalls
north
of
the
hill
pion
is
a
low
green
valley
encircled
with
hills
and
in
the
face
of
one
of
its
ledges
accessible
only
by
a
ladder
we
were
pointed
out
the
cave
of
the
seven
sleepers
this
favorite
myth
which
our
patriotism
has
transferred
to
the
highlands
of
the
hudson
in
a
modified
shape
took
its
most
popular
form
in
the
legend
of
the
seven
sleepers
and
this
grotto
at
ephesus
was
for
many
centuries
the
object
of
christian
and
moslem
pilgrimage
the
christian
legend
that
in
the
time
of
the
persecution
of
diocletian
seven
young
men
escaped
to
this
cave
and
slept
there
two
centuries
and
awoke
to
find
christianity
the
religion
of
the
empire
was
adopted
and
embellished
by
mohammed
in
his
version
the
wise
dog
ketmehr
or
al
rakiin
as
the
koran
names
him
becomes
an
important
character
the
young
men
says
along
the
side
of
the
hill
to
the
cave
the
dog
go
to
follow
them
they
take
up
stones
to
make
him
go
back
for
they
of
him
bark
and
let
the
people
know
where
they
hide
but
the
dog
not
to
go
back
he
sit
down
on
him
hind
and
him
look
berry
wise
by
and
by
he
speak
he
say
the
name
of
god
did
you
know
that
ask
him
the
young
men
know
it
the
dog
say
you
born
they
see
the
dog
he
wise
by
allah
and
know
great
deal
and
let
him
to
go
with
this
dog
ketmehr
he
is
gone
so
our
prophet
say
to
be
in
paradise
no
other
dog
be
there
so
i
the
names
of
the
seven
sleepers
and
ketmehr
are
in
great
talismanic
repute
throughout
the
east
they
are
engraved
upon
swords
and
upon
gold
and
precious
stones
and
in
smyrna
you
may
buy
these
charms
against
evil
keeping
round
the
hill
pion
we
reached
the
ruins
of
the
gymnasium
heaps
of
stone
amid
brick
arches
the
remains
of
an
enormous
building
near
it
is
the
north
gate
of
the
city
a
fine
marble
structure
now
almost
buried
still
circling
pion
we
found
ourselves
in
a
narrow
valley
on
the
other
side
of
which
was
the
long
ridge
of
conessus
which
runs
southward
towards
the
sea
conessus
seems
to
have
been
the
of
the
old
town
this
narrow
valley
is
stuffed
with
remains
of
splendid
buildings
of
which
nothing
is
now
to
be
seen
but
heaps
of
fine
marble
walls
capitals
columns
in
prodigal
waste
we
stopped
to
admire
a
bit
of
carving
or
to
notice
a
greek
inscription
and
passed
on
to
the
stadium
to
the
little
theatre
to
the
tomb
of
luke
on
one
of
the
lintels
of
the
entrance
of
this
tomb
in
white
marble
as
fresh
as
if
carved
yesterday
is
a
cross
and
under
it
the
figure
of
an
egyptian
ox
the
emblem
of
that
saint
we
emerged
from
this
gorge
to
a
wide
view
of
the
plain
and
a
glimpse
of
an
arm
of
the
sea
on
this
plain
are
the
scattered
ruins
of
the
old
city
brick
stone
and
marble
desolation
on
the
left
near
the
sea
is
a
conical
hill
crowned
by
one
of
the
towers
of
the
ancient
wall
and
dignified
with
the
name
of
the
of
in
this
plain
is
neither
life
nor
cultivation
but
vegetation
riots
over
the
crumbling
remains
of
ephesus
and
fever
waits
there
its
chance
human
prey
we
stood
on
the
side
of
the
hill
pion
amid
the
fallen
columns
and
heaped
walls
of
its
great
theatre
it
was
to
this
theatre
that
the
multitude
rushed
when
excited
against
paul
by
demetrius
the
silversmith
who
earned
his
religion
into
his
business
and
here
the
companions
of
paul
endeavored
to
be
heard
and
could
not
for
with
one
voice
about
the
space
of
two
hours
cried
out
great
is
diana
of
the
this
amphitheatre
for
fifty
thousand
spectators
is
scooped
out
of
the
side
of
the
hill
and
its
tiers
of
seats
are
still
indicated
what
a
magnificent
view
they
must
have
enjoyed
of
the
city
and
the
sea
beyond
for
the
water
then
came
much
nearer
and
the
spectator
who
may
have
wearied
of
the
strutting
of
the
buskined
heroes
on
the
stage
or
of
the
monotonous
chant
of
the
chorus
could
rest
his
eye
upon
the
purple
slopes
of
conessus
upon
the
colonnades
and
domes
of
the
opulent
city
upon
the
blue
waves
that
bore
the
merchants
ships
of
rome
and
alexandria
and
berytus
the
theatre
is
a
mine
of
the
most
exquisite
marbles
and
we
left
its
treasures
with
reluctance

once
washed
by

we
might
have
wandered
for
days
amid
the
fragments
but
to
what
purpose
at
ephesus
we
encountered
no
living
thing
man
has
deserted
it
silence
reigns
over
the
plain
nature
slowly
effaces
the
evidence
of
his
occupation
and
the
sea
even
slinks
away
from
it
no
great
city
that
i
have
seen
is
left
to
such
absolute
desolation
not

time
was
doubtless
when
gold
pieces
piled
two
deep
on
this
ground
could
not
have
purchased
it
and
the
buyers
or
sellers
never
imagined
that
the
city
lots
of
ephesus
could
become
worth
so
little
as
they
are
if
one
were
disposed
to
muse
upon
the
vagaries
of
human
progress
this
would
be
the
spot
no
civilization
no
religion
has
been
wanting
to
it
its
vast
cyclopean
foundations
were
laid
by
simple
pagans
it
was
in
the
polytheistic
belief
of
the
greeks
that
it
attained
the
rank
of
one
of
the
most
polished
and
wealthy
cities
of
antiquity
famed
for
its
arts
its
schools
of
poetry
of

of

and

here
one
of
the

of
his
folly
in
fact
scarcely
any
famous
name
of
antiquity
is
wanting
to
the
adornment
of
this
hospitable
city
under
the
religion
of
christ
it
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
acquire
equal
celebrity
thanks
to
the
residence
of
paul
the
and
to
its
conspicuous
position
at
the
head
of
the
seven
churches
of
asia
from
ephesus
went
forth
the
news
of
the
gospel
as
formerly
had
spread
the
rites
of
diana
and
churches
and
schools
of
philosophy
succeeded
the
temples
and
gymnasia
of
the
polytheists
and
in
turn
the
cross
was
supplanted
by
the
crescent
but
it
was
in
the
day
when
islamism
was
no
longer
a
vital
faith
and
except
a
few
beautiful
ruins
the
moslem
occupation
has
contributed
nothing
to
the
glory
of
ephesus
and
now
paganism
christianity
and
moslemism
seem
alike
to
have
forsaken
the
weary
theatre
of
so
much
brilliant
history
as
we
went
out
to
the
station
by
the
row
of
booths
and
a
modern
greek
of
i
do
not
know
what
religion
offered
to
sell
me
an
image
of
i
do
not
know
what
faith
there
is
great
curiosity
at
present
about
the
relics
and
idols
of
dead
religions
and
a
brisk
manufacture
of
them
has
sprung
up
it
is
in
the
hands
of
sceptics
who
indifferently
propagate
the
images
of
the
virgin
mary
or
of
the
chaste
huntress
diana
the
swift
asiatic
train
took
us
back
to
smyrna
in
a
golden
sunset
we
had
been
warned
by
the
agent
not
to
tarry
a
moment
beyond
eight
and
we
hurried
breathless
to
the
boat
fortunately
the
steamer
had
not
sailed
we
were
in
time
and
should
have
been
if
we
had
remained
on
shore
till
eight
the
next
morning
all
night
long
we
were
loading
freight
with
an
intolerable
rattling
of
chains
puffing
of
the
and
swearing
of
boatmen
after
the
novelty
of
swearing
in
an
oriental
tongue
has
worn
off
it
is
no
more
enjoyable
than
any
other
kind
of
profanity
adventurers
we
sailed
away
from
smyrna
sunday
morning
with
the
achille
more
crowded
than
when
we
entered
that
port
the
passengers
still
further
encroached
upon
the
the
emir
of
damascus
with
all
his
rugs
and
beds
had
been
pushed
farther
towards
the
stern
and
more
harems
occupied
temporary
pens
on
our
deck
and
drew
away
our
attention
from
the
natural
scenery
the
venerable
greek
bishop
of
smyrna
was
a
passenger
also
the
tall
pasha
of
that
city
just
relieved
and
ordered
to
constantinople
as
pashas
are
continually
at
the
whim
of
the
sultan
we
had
three
pashas
on
board
recalled
from
haifa
who
had
been
only
twenty
days
at
his
post
the
pasha
of
smyrna
was
accompanied
by
his
family
described
on
the
register
as
his
wife
and
others
an
indefinite
expression
to
define
an
indefinite
condition
the
wife
had
a
room
below
the
were
penned
up
in
a
cushioned
area
on
the
saloon
deck
and
there
they
squatted
all
day
veiled
and
robed
in
white
poor
things
without
the
least
occupation
for
hand
or
mind
near
them
other
harems
of
greeks
and
turks
women
babies
slaves
all
in
an
oriental
mess
ate
curds
and
green
lettuce
we
coasted
along
the
indented
picturesque
shore
of
asia
having
in
view
the
mountains
about
ancient
pergamus
the
seat
of
one
of
the
seven
churches
and
before
noon
came
to
mitylene
the
ancient
lesbos
a
large
island
which
bears
another
mount
olympus
and
cast
anchor
in
the
bay
upon
which
the
city
stands
by
the
bend
of
the
bay
and
the
opposite
coast
the
town
is
charmingly
the
site
of
mitylene
like
so
many
of
these
island
cities
is
an
amphitheatre
and
the
green
and
blooming
with
are
dotted
with
white
houses
and
villages
the
scene
is
italian
rather
than
oriental
and
gives
one
the
general
impression
of
castellamare
or
sorrento
but
the
city
is
prettier
to
look
at
than
to
explore
as
its
broad
and
clean
streets
its
ordinary
houses
and
inhabitants
take
us
out
of
our
ideal
voyaging
and
into
the
regions
of
the
commonplace
the
shops
were
closed
and
the
country
people
who
in
all
countries
appear
to
derive
an
unexplained
pleasure
in
wandering
about
the
streets
of
a
city
hand
in
hand
were
seeking
this
mild
recreation
a
youthful
jew
to
whom
the
sunday
was
naught
under
pretence
of
showing
us
something
antique
led
us
into
the
den
of
a
greek
to
whom
it
was
also
naught
and
whose
treasures
were
bags
of
defaced
copper
coins
of
the
roman
period
upon
the
point
above
the
city
is
a
fine
mediaeval
fortress
now
a
turkish
fort
where
we
encountered
in
the
sentinel
at
the
gate
the
only
official
in
the
orient
who
ever
refused
backsheesh
i
do
not
know
what
his
idea
is
from
the
walls
we
looked
upon
the
blue
strait
the
circling
purple
hills
of
asia
upon
islands
pretty
villages
and
distant
mountains
soft
hazy
serrated
in
short
upon
a
scene
of
poetry
and
peace
into
which
the
ancient
stone
bastion
by
the
harbor
which
told
of
days
of
peril
and
a
ruined
aqueduct
struggling
down
the
hill
back
of
the
town
remnant
of
more
vigorous
days
no
disturbance
in
lesbos
we
are
at
the
source
of
lyric
poetry
the
æolian
spring
of
greece
here
alcæus
was
born
here
we
come
upon
the
footsteps
of
sappho
we
must
go
back
to
a
period
when
this
and
all
the
islands
of
these
heavenly
seas
were
blooming
masses
of
vegetation
the
hills
hung
with
forests
the
slopes
purple
with
the
vine
the
valleys
laughing
with
flowers
and
fruit
and
everywhere
the
primitive
joyful
greek
life
no
doubt
manners
were
somewhat
rude
and
passions
love
and
hate
and
revenge
were
frankly
exhibited
but
in
all
the
homely
life
ran
a
certain
culture
which
seems
to
us
beautiful
even
in
the
refinement
of
this
shamefaced
age
the
hardy
youth
of
the
islands
sailed
into
far
seas
and
in
exchange
for
the
bounty
of
their
soil
brought
back
foreign
fabrics
of
luxury
we
know
that
lesbos
was
no
stranger
to
the
athenian
influence
its
scholars
had
heard
plato
and
aristotle
and
the
warriors
of
athens
respected
it
both
as
a
foe
and
an
ally
charakos
a
brother
of
sappho
went
to
egypt
with
a
ship
full
of
wine
and
returned
with
the
beautiful
slave
doricha
as
part
at
least
of
the
reward
of
his
venture
after
the
return
of
sappho
and
her
husband
from
their
flight
into
sicily
the
poet
lived
for
many
years
at
mitylene
but
she
is
supposed
to
have
been
born
in
eresso
on
the
southwestern
point
of
the
island
where
the
ruins
of
the
acropolis
and
remains
of
a
still
mark
the
site
of
the
famous
town
at
any
rate
she
lived
there
with
her
husband
kerkylas
a
landed
proprietor
and
a
person
of
consequence
like
a
dame
of
noble
birth
and
gentle
breeding
as
she
was
and
in
her
verse
we
have
a
glimpse
of
her
walking
upon
the
sandy
shore
with
her
little
daughter
the
beautiful
child
whom
she
would
not
give
up
for
the
kingdom
of
lydia
nor
for
heavenly
lesbos
itself
that
sappho
was
beautiful
as
her
image
on
the
ancient
coins
represents
her
and
that
she
was
consumed
by
passion
for
a
handsome
youth
the
world
likes
to
believe
but
maximus
of
tyre
says
that
she
was
small
and
dark
are
not
so
plenty
even
in
heaven
that
genius
and
beauty
can
be
lavished
upon
one
person
we
are
prone
to
insist
that
the
poet
who
revels
in
imagination
and
sounds
the
depth
of
passion
is
revealing
his
own
heart
and
that
the
tale
that
seems
so
real
must
be
a
personal
experience
the
little
glimpse
we
have
of
sappho
life
does
not
warrant
us
to
find
in
it
the
passionate
tempest
of
her
burning
lyrics
nor
is
it
consistent
with
her
social
position
that
she
should
expose
upon
the
her
passion
for
the
handsome
phaon
like
a
troubadour
of
the
middle
ages
or
a
zingara
of
bohemia
if
that
consuming
fire
was
only
quenched
in
the
sea
at
the
foot
of
rock
of
woe
at
least
our
emotion
may
be
tempered
by
the
soothing
knowledge
that
the
leap
must
have
been
taken
when
the
enamored
singer
had
passed
her
sixtieth
year
we
did
not
see
them
at
mitylene
but
travellers
into
the
interior
speak
of
the
beautiful
women
the
descendants
of
kings
daughters
the
rewards
of
grecian
heroes
near
old
eresso
the
women
preserve
the
type
of
that
indestructible
beauty
and
in
the
large
brown
eyes
voluptuous
busts
and
elastic
gait
one
may
deem
that
he
sees
the
originals
of
the
antique
statues
another
famous
woman
flits
for
a
moment
before
us
at
lesbos
it
is
the
celebrated
empress
irene
whose
cruelty
was
hardly
needed
to
preserve
a
name
that
her
talent
could
have
perpetuated
an
athenian
virgin
and
an
orphan
at
seventeen
she
became
the
wife
of
leo
iv
and
at
length
the
ruler
of
the
eastern
empire
left
the
guardian
of
the
empire
and
her
son
constantine
she
managed
both
until
the
lad
in
his
maturity
sent
his
mother
into
retirement
the
restless
woman
conspired
against
him
he
fled
was
captured
and
brought
to
the
palace
and
lodged
in
the
porphyry
chamber
where
he
first
had
seen
the
light
and
where
he
last
saw
it
for
his
eyes
were
put
out
by
the
order
of
irene
his
very
existence
was
forgotten
in
the
depths
of
the
palace
and
for
several
years
the
ambitious
mother
reigned
with
brilliancy
and
the
respect
of
distant
potentates
until
a
conspiracy
of
eunuchs
overturned
her
power
and
she
was
banished
to
lesbos
here
history
which
delights
in
these
strokes
of
poetic
justice
represents
the
empress
earning
her
bread
by
the
use
of
her
distaff
as
we
came
from
mitylene
into
the
open
sea
the
view
was
surpassingly
lovely
islands
green
and
poetic
a
coast
ever
retreating
and
advancing
as
if
in
coquetry
with
the
blue
waves
purple
robing
the
hills
voyage
for
poets
and
we
were
coming
at
night
to
tenedos
to
which
the
crafty
greeks
withdrew
their
fleet
when
they
pretended
to
abandon
the
siege
and
to
old
troy
opposite
we
should
be
able
to
feel
their
presence
in
the
darkness
our
steamer
as
we
have
intimated
was
a
study
of
nationalities
and
languages
as
well
as
of
manners
we
were
english
american
greek
italian
turkish
arab
russian
french

kurd
one
might
talk
with
a
person
just
from
mecca
or
medina
from
bagdad
from
calcutta
from
every
greek
or
turkish
island
and
from
most
of
the
capitals
of
europe
a
couple
of
capuchins
tonsured
in
brown
serge
with
hanging
crosses
walked
up
and
down
amid
the
throng
of
christians
moslems
and
pagans
withdrawn
from
the
world
while
in
it
like
beings
of
a
new
sex
there
was
a
couple
opposite
us
at
table
whom
we
could
not
make
out
recently
married
or
recently
eloped
the
man
apparently
a
turkish
officer
and
his
companion
a
tall
showy
woman
you
might
say
a
frenchman
idea
of
physical
beauty
a
little
like
a
wax
madonna
but
with
nothing
holy
about
her
said
by
some
to
be
a
circassian
by
others
to
be
a
french
grisette
on
an
eastern
tour
but
she
spoke
italian
and
might
be
one
of
the
continental
countesses
the
square
occupied
by
the
emir
and
his
sort
of
bazaar
of
rugs
and
music
all
day
long
a
soloist
on
three
notes
singing
in
the
arab
drawl
an
unending
improvised
ballad
and
accompanying
himself
on
the
mandolin
when
we
go
to
look
at
and
listen
to
him
the
musician
betrays
neither
nor
pride
unless
you
detect
the
latter
in
a
superior
smile
that
plays
about
his
lips
as
he
throws
back
his
head
and
lets
his
voice
break
into
a
falsetto
it
probably
does
not
even
occur
to
his
oriental
conceit
that
he
does
well
his
race
have
taken
for
granted
a
thousand
years
he
could
not
be
instructed
by
the
orchestra
of
von
bulow
nor
be
astonished
by
the
lohengrin
of
wagner
among
the
adventurers
on
all
had
more
or
less
the
appearance
of
experiments
in
that
odd
particularly
liked
the
french
prestidigitateur
caseneau
for
his
bold
eye
utter
and
that
indefinable
varnish
upon
him
which
belonged
as
much
to
his
dress
as
to
his
manner
and
suggested
the
gentleman
without
concealing
the
adventurer
he
had
a
taste
for
antiquities
and
wore
some
antique
gems
which
had
i
know
not
what
mysterious
about
them
as
if
he
had
inherited
them
from
an
ephesian
magician
or
a
saracenic
doctor
of
the
black
art
at
the
table
after
dinner
surrounded
by
french
and
italians
the
conjurer
exhibited
some
tricks
at
cards
i
dare
say
they
were
not
extraordinary
yet
they
pleased
me
just
as
well
as
the
manifestations
of
the
spiritists
one
of
them
i
noted
the
trickster
was
blindfolded
a
gentleman
counted
out
a
pack
of
cards
and
while
doing
so
mentally
fixed
upon
one
of
them
by
number
caseneau
took
the
pack
still
blinded
and
threw
out
the
card
the
gentleman
had
thought
of
the
experiment
was
repeated
by
sceptics
who
suspected
a
confederate
but
the
result
was
always
the
same
the
circassian
beauty
turned
out
to
be
a
jewess
from
smyrna
i
believe
the
jewesses
of
that
luxurious
city
imitate
all
the
kinds
of
beauty
in
the
world
in
the
evening
the
italians
were
grouped
around
the
tables
in
the
saloon
upon
which
cards
were
cast
about
matched
sorted
and
redistributed
and
there
were
little
piles
of
silver
at
the
corners
the
occasional
chinking
of
which
appeared
to
add
to
the
interest
of
the
amusement
on
deck
the
english
and
americans
were
singing
the
hymns
of
the
protestant
faith
and
in
the
lull
of
the
strains
of
mother
dear
jerusalem
you
might
hear
the
twang
of
strings
and
the
whine
of
some
arab
improvisatore
on
the
forward
deck
and
the
chink
of
changing
silver
below
we
were
making
our
way
through
a
superb
night
thousand
people
packed
so
closely
that
you
could
not
move
without
stepping
into
a
harem
or
a
mass
of
greek
pilgrims
hymns
gambling
listening
to
a
recital
of
the
deeds
of
antar
over
silver
waves
under
a
flooding
moon
and
along
the
dim
shores
of
asia
that
mysterious
continent
lay
in
the
obscurity
of
the
past
here
and
there
solitary
lights
from
some
shepherd
hut
in
the
hills
or
fortress
casemate
by
the
shore
were
the
rents
in
the
veil
through
which
we
saw
antiquity
the
dardanelles
the
achille
which
has
a
nose
for
freight
but
none
for
poetry
did
not
stop
at
tenedos
puffed
steadily
past
the
plain
of
troy
turned
into
the
broad
opening
of
the
dardanelles
and
by
daylight
was
anchored
midway
between
the
two
castles
on
such
a
night
if
ever
one
might
see
the
evolution
of
shadowy
armies
upon
the
windy
plain
indeed
this
conspicuous
site
was
anything
more
than
the
theatre
of
creations
spectators
on
the
walls
of
ilium
the
greeks
hastily
embarking
on
their
ships
for
tenedos
the
joyful
procession
that
drew
the
fatal
gift
into
the
impregnable
walls
there
is
a
strong
current
southward
through
the
dardanelles
which
swung
the
vessel
round
as
we
came
to
anchor
the
forts
which
with
their
heavy
modern
guns
completely
command
this
strait
are
something
less
than
a
mile
and
a
half
apart
and
near
each
is
a
large
and
handsome
town
on
the
european
shore
and
on
the
asiatic
the
latter
name
signifies
the
and
is
derived
from
the
chief
manufactory
of
the
place
the
town
of
a
couple
of
thousand
houses
gayly
painted
and
decorated
in
lively
colors
lies
upon
a
sandy
flat
and
presents
a
very
cheerful
appearance
it
is
a
great
asiatic
entrepôt
for
european
products
and
consular
flags
attest
its
commercial
importance
when
i
came
upon
deck
its
enterprising
traders
had
already
boarded
the
steamer
and
encumbered
it
with
their
pottery
which
found
a
ready
market
with
the
pilgrims
for
it
is
both
cheap
and
ugly
perhaps
we
should
rather
say
fantastic
than
ugly
you
see
specimens
of
it
all
over
the
east
and
in
the
bazaars
of
cairo
jerusalem
and
damascus
it
may
be
offered
you
as
something
rare
whatever
the
vessel
is
pitcher
cup
vase
jar
or
form
is
either
that
of
some
impossible
animal
some
griffin
or
dragon
or
dog
of
the
underworld
or
its
spout
is
the
neck
and
head
of
some
fantastic
monster
the
ware
is
painted
in
the
most
startling
reds
greens
yellows
and
blacks
and
sometimes
gilt
and
then
glazed
it
is
altogether
hideous
and
fascinating
enough
to
drive
the
majolica
out
of
favor
above
these
two
towns
the
strait
expands
into
a
sort
of
bay
formed
on
the
north
by
a
promontory
jutting
out
from
the
asiatic
shore
and
upon
this
promontory
it
is
now
agreed
stood
old
abydos
it
is
occupied
by
a
fort
which
grimly
regards
a
corresponding
one
on
the
opposite
shore
not
a
mile
distant
here
leander
swam
to
hero
byron
to
aquatic
fame
and
here
xerxes
laid
his
bridge
all
this
is
plain
to
be
seen
this
is
the
narrowest
part
of
the
passage
exactly
opposite
this
sloping
site
of
abydos
is
a
depression
between
two
high
cliffs
the
only
point
where
the
persian
could
have
rested
the
european
extremity
of
his
bridge
and
it
surely
requires
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
to
see
hero
standing
upon
this
projecting
point
holding
the
torch
for
her
lover
the
shore
is
very
pretty
each
side
not
bold
but
quiet
scenery
and
yet
there
is
a
contrast
on
the
asiatic
horizon
are
mountains
rising
behind
each
other
while
the
narrow
peninsula
the
thracian
chersonesus
of
the
ancients
which
forms
the
western
bank
of
the
dardanelles
offers
only
a
range
of
moderate
hills
what
a
beautiful
stream
indeed
is
this
and
how
fond
history
has
been
of
enacting
its
spectacles
upon
it
how
the
civilizations
of
the
east
and
west
in
a
continual
flow
and
reflow
push
each
other
across
it
with
a
sort
of
periodic
regularity
it
is
the
scene
of
a
great
movement
and
from
age
to
age
the
destinies
of
the
race
have
seemed
to
hang
upon
its
possession
and
from
time
to
time
the
attention
of
the
world
is
concentrated
upon
this
between
two
continents
under
whatever
name
the
oriental
civilization
has
been
a
misfortune
and
the
western
a
blessing
to
the
and
how
narrowly
has
europe
more
than
once
from
xerxes
to
chosroes
from
omar
to
the
osmanlis
seemed
to
escape
the
torrent
of
eastern
slavery
once
the
culture
of
greece
passed
these
limits
and
annexed
all
asia
minor
and
the
territory
as
far
as
the
euphrates
to
the
empire
of
intelligence
who
shall
say
that
the
day
is
not
at
hand
when
the
ancient
movement
of
free
thought
if
not
of
grecian
art
and
arms
is
about
to
be
renewed
and
europe
is
not
again
to
impose
its
laws
and
manners
upon
little
asia
the
conquest
which
one
sees
going
on
under
his
eyes
is
not
indeed
with
the
pomp
of
armies
but
by
the
more
powerful
and
enduring
might
of
commerce
intercourse
and
the
weight
of
a
world
opinion
diffused
by
travel
and
literature
the
osmanli
sits
supinely
and
watches
the
change
the
greeks
the
rajahs
of
all
religions
establish
schools
and
the
new
generation
is
getting
ready
for
the
revolution
the
turk
does
not
care
for
schools
that
it
may
be
his
fate
to
abandon
european
turkey
and
even
constantinople
he
admits
but
it
is
plain
that
if
he
goes
thus
far
he
must
go
farther
and
that
he
must
surrender
a
good
part
of
the
roman
eastern
empire
for
any
one
can
see
that
the
hellespont
could
not
be
occupied
by
two
powers
and
that
it
is
no
more
possible
to
divide
the
control
of
the
bosphorus
than
it
is
that
of
the
hudson
or
the
thames
the
morning
was
cold
and
the
temperature
as
well
as
the
sky
admonished
us
that
we
were
passing
out
of
the
warm
latitude
miles
from
the
chang
and
eng
forts
we
passed
near
but
did
not
call
at
gallipoli
an
ancient
city
with
few
antiquities
but
of
great
strategic
importance
whoever
holds
it
has
the
key
to
constantinople
and
the
black
sea
it
was
seized
by
the
moslems
in
the
thirteenth
century
before
they
imposed
the
religion
of
the
koran
upon
the
city
of
constantine
and
it
was
early
occupied
by
the
english
and
french
in
in
the
war
that
secured
that
city
to
the
successor
of
the
prophet
entering
upon
the
sea
of
marmora
the
propontis
we
had
fortunately
smooth
water
but
a
cold
the
propontis
has
enjoyed
a
nauseous
reputation
with
all
mariners
ancient
and
modern
i
do
know
that
its
form
has
anything
to
do
with
it
but
if
the
reader
will
take
the
trouble
to
consult
a
map
he
will
see
how
nearly
this
hag
of
water
with
its
two
ducts
the
bosphorus
and
the
hellespont
resembles
a
human
stomach
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
in
the
voyage
from
gallipoli
to
constantinople
except
the
island
of
marmora
famous
for
the
quarries
which
furnish
marbles
for
the
palaces
of
the
bosphorus
and
for
eyoub
and
scutari
the
two
great
cities
of
the
dead
we
passed
near
enough
to
distinguish
clearly
its
fine
perpendicular
cliffs
it
was
dark
before
we
saw
the
lights
of
stamboul
rise
out
of
the
water
it
is
impossible
at
night
to
enter
the
golden
horn
through
the
mazes
of
shipping
and
we
cast
anchor
outside
the
mile
or
two
of
along
the
promontory
of
the
old
city
and
the
gleams
upon
the
coast
of
ancient
chalcedon
were
impressive
and
exciting
to
the
imagination
but
owing
to
the
lateness
of
our
arrival
we
lost
all
the
emotions
which
have
struck
other
travellers
anything
but
dumb
upon
coming
in
sight
of
the
capital
of
the
moslem
empire
the
capital
which
we
know
as
constantinople
lying
in
two
continents
presents
itself
as
three
cities
the
long
hornshaped
promontory
between
the
sea
of
marmora
and
the
golden
horn
is
the
site
of
ancient
byzantium
which
constantine
baptized
with
his
own
name
and
which
the
turks
call
stamboul
the
ancient
city
was
on
the
eastern
extremity
now
known
as
seraglio
point
its
important
position
was
always
recognized
and
it
was
sharply
contended
for
by
the
spartans
the
athenians
the
macedonians
and
the
persians
like
the
city
of
romulus
it
occupies
seven
hills
and
its
noble
heights
are
conspicuous
from
afar
by
sea
or
in
the
fourth
century
it
was
surrounded
by
a
wall
which
followed
the
water
on
three
sides
and
ran
across
the
base
of
the
promontory
over
four
miles
from
the
seven
towers
on
the
propontis
to
the
cemetery
of
eyoub
on
the
golden
horn
the
which
so
many
times
saved
the
effeminate
city
from
the
barbarians
of
the
north
and
the
saracens
of
arabia
stands
yet
with
its
battered
towers
and
score
of
crumbling
gates
the
second
city
on
a
blunt
promontory
between
the
golden
horn
and
the
bosphorus
overlooks
the
ancient
byzantium
and
is
composed
of
three
districts
and
tophanna
on
the
water
and
climbing
up
the
hill
and
pera
which
crowns
the
summit
galata
was
a
commercial
settlement
of
the
thirteenth
century
pera
is
altogether
modern
the
third
city
is
scutari
exactly
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
golden
horn
and
a
little
north
of
ancient
chalcedon
which
was
for
over
a
thousand
years
the
camp
of
successive
besieging
armies
georgians
persians
saracens
and
turks
the
city
of
the
crescent
like
a
veiled
beauty
of
the
harem
did
not
at
once
disclose
to
us
its
charms
it
was
at
six
in
the
morning
on
the
eleventh
day
of
blooming
may
that
we
landed
on
the
dirty
quay
of
tophanna
the
morning
was
cloudy
cold
misty
getting
its
weather
from
the
black
sea
and
during
the
day
rain
fell
in
a
very
occidental
dreariness
through
the
mist
loomed
the
heights
of
seraglio
point
and
a
hundred
minaret
peaks
and
domes
appeared
to
float
in
the
air
above
the
veiled
city
along
the
floating
lower
bridge
across
the
golden
horn
poured
an
unceasing
procession
of
spectres
caïques
were
shooting
about
in
every
direction
steamers
for
the
bosphorus
for
scutari
for
the
islands
were
momently
arriving
and
departing
from
their
stations
below
the
bridge
and
the
huge
bulk
of
the
turkish
ironclads
could
be
discerned
at
their
anchorage
before
the
palace
of
beshiktash
the
scene
was
animated
but
there
was
not
visible
as
much
shipping
as
i
had
expected
to
see
in
this
great
port
the
customs
official
on
the
quay
was
of
a
very
inquisitive
turn
of
mind
but
we
could
excuse
him
on
the
ground
of
his
age
and
ignorance
for
he
was
evidently
endeavoring
to
repair
the
neglected
opportunities
of
his
youth
our
large
luggage
had
gone
to
the
in
charge
of
who
has
a
genius
for
and
only
our
small
parcels
and
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
inspector
on
the
quay
but
he
insisted
upon
opening
every
bag
and
investigating
every
article
of
the
toilet
and
garment
of
the
night
he
even
ripped
open
a
feather
pillow
which
one
of
the
ladies
carried
with
her
and
neither
the
rain
on
the
open
dock
nor
our
respectable
appearance
saved
our
effects
from
his
most
searching
attentions
the
discoveries
of
general
di
and
the
interest
that
europeans
take
in
antiquities
have
recently
convinced
the
turks
that
these
relics
must
have
some
value
and
an
order
had
been
issued
to
seize
and
confiscate
all
curiosities
of
this
sort
i
trembled
therefore
when
the
inspector
got
his
hands
upon
a
which
i
had
brought
from
cyprus
where
it
had
been
used
by
some
phoenician
baby
probably
three
thousand
years
ago
the
fellow
turned
it
round
and
regarded
it
with
serious
ignorance
and
doubt
is
that
he
asked
achmed
that
nothing
but
a
piece
of
pottery
something
for
a
child
without
his
mother
i
think
is
nothing
not
worth
two
the
confiscator
of
antiquities
evidently
had
not
the
slightest
knowledge
of
his
business
he
hesitated
but
achmed
perfect
indifference
of
manner
determined
him
and
he
slowly
put
the
precious
relic
back
into
the
box
the
inspector
parted
from
us
with
regret
but
we
left
him
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
virtue
unassailed
by
the
least
bribe
unusual
and
i
imagine
an
unwelcome
possession
in
this
region
donkeys
were
not
to
be
had
nor
carriages
and
we
climbed
on
foot
the
very
steep
hill
to
the
hotel
in
pera
ascending
roughly
paved
crooked
streets
lined
with
rickety
houses
and
occasionally
mounting
stairs
for
a
mile
through
a
quarter
that
has
the
shabbiness
but
not
the
picturesqueness
of
the
orient
a
squad
of
porters
seized
our
luggage
and
bore
it
before
us
the
porters
are
the
beasts
of
burden
and
most
of
them
wear
heavy
saddles
upon
which
boxes
and
trunks
can
be
strapped
no
drays
were
visible
heavy
burdens
hogsheads
barrels
and
cases
of
goods
were
borne
between
two
long
stout
poles
carried
by
four
athletic
men
as
they
move
along
the
street
staggering
under
the
heavy
load
everybody
is
obliged
precipitately
to
make
way
for
them
for
their
impetus
is
such
that
they
can
not
check
their
career
we
see
these
gigantic
fellows
at
every
with
their
long
poles
waiting
for
a
job
which
were
formerly
in
much
request
are
gradually
disappearing
though
there
is
nothing
at
present
to
exactly
take
the
place
of
these
lumbering
conveyances
carriages
increase
every
year
but
they
are
expensive
and
they
can
only
ascend
the
height
of
pera
by
a
long
circuit
the
place
of
the
sedan
and
the
carriage
is
however
to
some
extent
supplied
by
a
railway
in
galata
the
cars
of
which
are
drawn
up
by
a
stationary
engine
and
on
each
side
of
the
golden
horn
is
a
running
wherever
the
ground
is
practicable
to
one
coming
from
the
west
i
suppose
that
constantinople
would
present
a
very
mixed
and
bizarre
appearance
and
that
he
would
be
impressed
by
the
silence
of
the
busiest
streets
in
which
the
noise
of
wheels
and
the
hum
of
a
western
capital
is
wanting
but
to
one
coming
from
the
east
galata
and
pera
seem
a
rather
vulgarized
european
town
the
frank
dress
predominates
although
it
is
relieved
by
the
red
fez
which
the
turks
generally
and
many
europeans
wear
variety
enough
there
is
in
costumes
but
the
grecian
the
bulgarian
the
albanian
have
taken
the
place
of
the
purely
oriental
and
the
traveller
in
the
turkish
capital
beholds
not
only
the
conflux
of
asia
and
europe
but
the
transition
in
buildings
in
apparel
in
manners
to
modern
fashions
few
veiled
women
are
seen
and
they
wear
a
white
strip
of
gauze
which
conceals
nothing
the
street
hawkers
the
sellers
of
sweets
of
sponges
and
of
cakes
are
not
more
peculiar
in
their
cries
than
those
of
london
and
paris
when
we
had
climbed
the
hill
we
came
into
the
long
main
street
of
pera
the
street
of
the
chief
shops
the
hotels
and
foreign
embassies
a
quarter
of
the
city
which
has
been
burned
over
as
often
as
san
francisco
and
is
now
built
up
substantially
with
stone
and
brick
and
contains
very
little
to
interest
the
seeker
of
novelty
after
we
had
secured
rooms
and
breakfasted
at
the
hotel
byzance
we
descended
the
hill
again
to
the
water
and
crossed
the
long
floating
bridge
to
stamboul
this
bridge
is
a
very
good
symbol
of
the
sultan
empire
its
wooden
upper
works
are
decayed
its
whole
structure
is
rickety
the
floats
that
support
it
are
unevenly
sunken
so
that
the
bridge
is
a
succession
of
swells
and
hollows
it
is
crowded
by
opposing
streams
of
the
most
incongruous
people
foot
and
horse
jumbled
together
it
is
encumbered
by
venders
of
eatables
and
auctioneers
of
cheap
wares
and
one
has
to
pay
toll
to
cross
it
but
it
is
a
microcosm
of
the
world
in
an
hour
one
may
see
pass
there
every
nationality
adventurers
from
every
clime
traders
priests
sailors
soldiers
of
europe
rude
peasants
of
the
provinces
sleek
merchants
of
the
orient
darwishes
jews
here
is
a
circassian
beauty
seeking
a
lover
through
the
carriage
window
here
a
turkish
grandee
on
a
prancing
richly
caparisoned
horse
here
moves
a
squad
of
black
soldiers
and
now
the
bridge
shakes
under
the
weight
of
a
train
of
flying
artillery
the
water
is
alive
with
the
ticklish
caïques
the
caique
is
a
long
narrow
boat
on
the
model
of
the
indian
canoe
and
as
thin
and
light
on
the
water
the
passenger
if
he
accomplishes
the
feat
of
getting
into
one
without
overturning
it
sits
upon
the
bottom
careful
not
to
wink
and
upset
it
the
oars
have
a
heavy
swell
near
the
handle
to
counterbalance
the
weight
of
the
long
blade
and
the
craft
skims
the
water
with
swiftness
and
a
most
agreeable
motion
the
caïques
are
as
numerous
on
the
water
as
the
yellow
mangy
dogs
on
shore
and
the
two
are
the
most
characteristic
things
in
constantinople
we
spent
a
good
part
of
the
day
in
wandering
about
the
bazaars
of
stamboul
and
we
need
not
repeat
what
has
been
heretofore
said
of
these
peculiar
shops
during
our
stay
in
the
city
we
very
thoroughly
explored
them
and
visited
most
of
the
great
khans
where
are
to
be
found
the
silks
of
broussa
of
beyrout
and
damascus
the
rugs
of
persia
the
carpets
of
asia
minor
the
arms
and
the
cunning
work
in
gold
silver
and
jewels
gathered
from
every
region
between
ispahan
and
darfour
we
found
the
bazaars
extensive
well
filled
and
dear
at
least
the
asking
price
was
enormous
and
we
wanted
the
time
and
patience
which
are
needed
for
the
slow
siege
of
reducing
the
merchants
to
decent
terms
the
bazaars
are
solidly
roofed
arcades
at
once
more
cleanly
and
less
picturesque
than
those
of
cairo
and
not
so
oriental
or
attractive
which
are
infrequent
in
cairo
abound
here
and
the
long
arcades
lined
with
cases
of
glittering
gems
enormous
pearls
sparkling
diamonds
emeralds
fit
for
the
pope
finger
and
every
gold
and
silver
temptation
exceed
anything
else
in
the
east
in
magnificence
and
yet
they
have
a
certain
modern
air
and
you
do
not
expect
to
find
in
them
those
quaint
and
fascinating
antique
patterns
of
work
the
inherited
skill
of
the
smiths
of
the
pharaohs
which
draw
you
into
the
dingy
recesses
of
the
copt
artificers
in
the
city
of
the
nile
from
the
valideh
khan
we
ascended
to
the
public
square
where
stands
the
seraskier
a
paved
open
place
surrounded
by
government
buildings
of
considerable
architectural
pretensions
and
dedicated
i
should
say
to
drumming
to
the
shifting
about
of
squads
of
soldiers
and
the
cantering
hither
and
thither
of
turkish
beys
near
it
is
the
old
mosque
of
sultan
beyezid
which
with
its
magnificent
arabesque
gates
makes
a
fine
external
impression
the
outer
court
is
surrounded
by
a
cloister
with
columns
of
and
porphyry
enclosing
a
fountain
and
three
stately
venerable
trees
the
trees
and
the
arcades
are
alive
with
doves
and
as
we
entered
more
than
a
thousand
flew
towards
us
in
a
cloud
with
a
great
rustling
and
cooing
they
are
protected
as
an
almost
sacred
appendage
of
the
mosque
and
are
said
to
be
bred
from
a
single
pair
which
the
sultan
bought
of
a
poor
woman
and
presented
to
the
house
he
had
built
three
centuries
and
a
half
ago
this
mosque
has
also
another
claim
to
the
gratitude
of
animals
for
all
the
dogs
of
stamboul
none
of
whom
have
any
home
but
the
street
nor
any
other
owner
than
the
prophet
resort
here
every
friday
as
regularly
if
not
as
piously
as
the
sultan
goes
to
pray
and
receive
their
weekly
bread
near
this
mosque
are
lines
of
booths
and
shops
which
had
a
fascination
for
me
as
long
as
i
remained
in
the
city
they
extend
from
the
trees
in
the
place
of
the
mosque
down
through
lanes
to
the
bazaars
the
keepers
of
them
were
typical
orientals
honest
jews
honest
moslems
withered
and
waiters
on
providence
and
a
good
bargain
suave
gracious
patient
gowned
and
turbaned
sitting
behind
their
trays
and
showcases
these
are
the
dealers
in
stones
both
precious
and
common
in
old
and
new
ornaments
and
the
thousand
cheap
adornments
in
glass
and
metal
which
the
humbler
classes
love
here
are
heaps
of
of
carnelians
of
agates
of
jasper
of
onyx
dishes
of
turquoise
strings
of
doubtful
pearls
barbarous
rings
and
brooches
charms
and
amulets
feast
of
color
for
the
eye
and
a
sight
to
kindle
the
imagination
for
these
bawbles
came
out
of
the
recesses
of
the
orient
were
gathered
by
wild
tribes
in
remote
deserts
and
transported
by
caravan
to
this
common
mart
these
dealers
buy
of
the
persian
merchants
and
of
adventurous
jew
travellers
who
range
all
the
deserts
from
teheran
to
upper
nubia
in
search
of
these
shining
stones
some
of
the
turquoises
are
rudely
set
in
silver
rings
but
most
of
them
are
merely
glued
to
the
end
of
little
sticks
these
generally
are
the
refuse
of
the
trade
for
the
finer
stones
go
to
the
great
jewellers
in
the
bazaar
or
to
the
western
markets
a
large
and
perfect
turquoise
of
good
color
is
very
rare
and
commands
a
large
price
but
the
cunning
workmen
of
persia
have
a
method
of
at
once
concealing
the
defects
of
a
turquoise
which
has
the
true
color
and
at
the
same
time
enhancing
its
value
by
engraving
upon
it
some
sentence
from
the
koran
or
some
word
which
is
a
charm
against
the
evil
eye
the
skill
of
the
engraver
is
shown
in
fitting
his
letters
and
flourishes
to
the
flaws
in
the
surface
of
the
stone
to
further
hide
any
appearance
of
imperfection
the
engraved
lines
are
often
gilded
with
a
venerable
moslem
who
sat
day
after
day
under
a
i
had
great
content
and
we
both
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
endless
bargaining
without
cheating
each
other
for
except
in
some
trifles
we
never
came
to
an
exact
agreement
he
was
always
promising
me
the
most
wonderful
things
for
the
next
day
which
he
would
procure
from
a
mysterious
jew
friend
who
carried
on
a
clandestine
commerce
with
some
bedawee
in
arabia
when
i
was
seated
he
would
pull
from
his
bosom
a
knotted
silk
handkerchief
and
carefully
untying
it
produce
a
talisman
presenting
it
between
his
thumb
and
finger
with
a
lift
of
the
eyebrows
and
a
cluck
of
the
tongue
that
expressed
the
rapture
i
would
feel
at
the
sight
of
it
to
be
sure
i
found
it
a
turquoise
set
in
rude
silver
faded
to
a
sickly
green
and
not
worth
sixpence
but
i
handed
it
back
with
a
sigh
that
such
a
jewel
was
beyond
my
means
and
intimated
that
something
less
costly
and
of
a
blue
color
would
suit
me
as
well
we
were
neither
of
us
deceived
while
we
maintained
the
courtesies
of
commercial
intercourse
sometimes
he
would
produce
from
his
bosom
an
emerald
of
real
value
or
an
opal
of
lovely
hues
and
occasionally
a
stone
in
some
peculiar
setting
which
i
had
admired
the
day
before
in
the
jewelry
bazaar
for
these
trinkets
upon
which
the
eye
of
the
traveller
has
been
seen
longingly
to
rest
are
shifted
about
among
this
mysterious
fraternity
to
meet
him
again
i
suppose
it
was
known
all
over
stamboul
that
a
prank
had
been
looking
for
a
persian
amulet
as
long
as
i
sat
with
my
friend
i
never
saw
him
actually
sell
anything
but
he
seemed
to
be
the
centre
of
mysterious
transactions
furtive
traders
continually
came
to
him
to
borrow
or
return
a
jewel
or
to
exchange
a
handful
of
trumpery
delusive
old
man
i
had
no
confidence
in
you
but
i
would
go
far
to
pass
another
day
in
your
tranquil
society
how
much
more
agreeable
you
were
than
the
young
nubian
at
an
opposite
stand
who
repelled
purchasers
by
his
supreme
indifference
and
met
all
my
feeble
advances
with
the
toss
of
the
head
and
the
cluck
in
the
left
cheek
which
is
the
peremptory
in
nubia
in
this
quarter
are
workers
in
shell
and
ivory
the
makers
of
spoons
of
with
handles
of
ivory
and
coral
the
fabricators
of
combs
dealers
in
books
and
a
long
street
of
little
shops
devoted
to
the
engraving
of
seals
to
wander
about
among
these
craftsmen
is
one
of
the
chief
pleasures
of
the
traveller
vast
as
stamboul
is
if
you
remove
from
it
the
mosques
and
nests
of
bazaars
it
would
not
be
worth
a
visit
seraglio
and
sophia
hippodrome
etc
having
procured
a
firman
we
devoted
a
day
to
the
old
seraglio
and
some
of
the
principal
mosques
of
stamboul
after
an
occupation
of
fifteen
centuries
as
a
royal
residence
the
seraglio
has
been
disused
for
nearly
forty
years
and
fire
neglect
and
decay
have
done
their
work
on
it
so
that
it
is
but
a
melancholy
reminiscence
of
its
former
splendor
it
occupies
the
ancient
site
of
byzantium
upon
the
point
and
is
enclosed
by
a
crumbling
wall
three
miles
in
circuit
no
royal
seat
in
the
world
has
a
more
lovely
situation
upon
the
summit
of
the
promontory
half
concealed
in
cypresses
is
the
cluster
of
buildings
of
all
ages
and
degrees
of
cheapness
in
which
are
the
imperial
apartments
and
offices
on
the
slopes
towards
the
sea
are
gardens
terraces
kiosks
and
fountains
we
climbed
up
the
hill
on
the
side
towards
pera
through
a
shabby
field
that
had
almost
the
appearance
of
a
city
and
through
a
neglected
grove
of
cypresses
where
some
deer
were
feeding
and
came
round
to
the
main
entrance
a
big
ugly
pavilion
with
eight
openings
over
the
arched
porte
gate
which
is
known
the
world
over
as
the
sublime
porte
through
this
we
passed
into
a
large
court
and
thence
to
the
small
one
into
which
the
sultan
only
is
permitted
to
ride
on
horseback
in
the
centre
of
this
is
a
fountain
where
formerly
pashas
foreordained
to
lose
their
heads
lost
them
on
the
right
a
low
range
of
buildings
covered
with
domes
but
no
chimneys
are
the
royal
kitchens
there
are
nine
of
them
for
the
sultan
one
for
the
chief
sultanas
and
so
on
down
to
the
one
devoted
to
the
cooking
of
the
food
for
the
servants
hundreds
of
beasts
hecatombs
were
slaughtered
daily
and
cooked
here
to
feed
the
vast
household
from
this
court
open
the
doors
into
the
halls
and
divans
and
various
apartments
one
of
them
leading
into
the
interior
is
called
the
gate
of
felicity
in
the
old
times
that
could
only
be
called
a
gate
of
felicity
which
let
a
person
out
of
this
spider
parlor
in
none
of
these
rooms
is
there
anything
specially
attractive
cheap
magnificence
in
decay
is
only
melancholy
we
were
better
pleased
in
the
gardens
where
we
looked
upon
galata
and
pera
upon
the
golden
horn
and
the
long
bridges
streaming
with
their
picturesque
processions
upon
the
bosphorus
and
its
palaces
and
thousands
of
sails
steamers
and
caïques
and
the
shining
heights
of
scutari
overhanging
the
slope
is
the
kiosk
or
summer
palace
of
sultan
moorad
a
saracenic
octagonal
structure
the
interior
walls
lined
with
persian
tiles
the
ceilings
painted
in
red
arabesques
and
gilded
in
mosaics
the
gates
of
bronze
inlaid
with
a
most
charming
building
said
to
be
in
imitation
of
a
kiosk
of
bagdad
in
it
we
saw
the
sultan
private
library
a
hundred
or
two
volumes
in
a
glass
case
that
had
no
appearance
of
having
been
read
either
by
the
sultan
or
his
wife
the
apartment
in
the
seraglio
which
is
the
object
of
curiosity
and
desire
is
the
i
suppose
it
is
the
richest
in
the
world
in
gems
it
is
certainly
a
most
wearisome
place
and
gave
me
a
contempt
for
earthly
treasure
in
the
centre
stands
a
persian
throne
chair
upon
a
board
platform
and
both
incrusted
with
rubies
pearls
emeralds
diamonds
there
are
covered
to
the
feet
with
diamonds
glistening
with
huge
diamonds
old
armor
thickly
set
with
precious
stones
and
stirrups
stiff
with
diamonds
and
emeralds
robes
embroidered
with
pearls
nothing
is
so
cheap
as
wealth
lavished
in
this
manner
at
first
we
were
dazzled
by
the
flashing
display
but
after
a
time
these
heaps
of
gems
seemed
as
common
in
our
eyes
as
pebbles
in
the
street
i
did
not
even
covet
an
emerald
as
large
as
my
fist
nor
a
in
which
were
fifteen
diamonds
each
as
large
as
the
end
of
my
thumb
nor
a
carpet
sown
with
pearls
some
of
which
were
of
the
size
of
pigeon
eggs
nor
aigrettes
which
were
blazing
with
internal
fires
nor
chairs
of
state
clocks
and
vases
the
whole
surfaces
of
which
were
on
fire
with
jewels
i
have
seen
an
old
oaken
table
carved
in
the
fifteenth
century
which
gave
me
more
pleasure
than
one
of
lapis
lazuli
which
is
exhibited
as
the
most
costly
article
in
this
collection
though
it
is
inlaid
with
precious
stones
and
the
pillars
that
support
the
mirror
are
set
with
diamonds
and
the
legs
and
claws
are
a
mass
of
diamonds
rubies
carbuncles
emeralds
topazes
and
huge
diamond
pendants
ornament
it
and
the
deep
fringe
in
front
is
altogether
of
diamonds
this
is
but
a
barbarous
ostentatious
and
tasteless
use
of
the
beautiful
and
i
suppose
gives
one
an
idea
of
the
inartistic
magnificence
of
the
oriental
courts
in
centuries
gone
by
this
has
i
presume
nothing
that
belonged
to
the
byzantine
emperors
before
the
moslem
conquest
some
of
whom
exceeded
in
their
magnificence
any
of
the
osmanli
sultans
arcadius
the
first
eastern
emperor
after
the
division
of
the
roman
world
rivalled
in
the
appointments
of
his
palace
which
stood
upon
this
spot
and
in
his
dress
the
magnificence
of
the
persian
monarchs
and
perhaps
the
luxurious
califs
of
bagdad
at
a
later
day
did
not
equal
his
splendor
his
robes
were
of
purple
a
color
reserved
exclusively
for
his
sacred
person
and
of
silk
embroidered
with
gold
dragons
his
diadem
was
of
gold
set
with
gems
of
inestimable
worth
his
throne
was
massy
gold
and
when
he
went
abroad
he
rode
in
a
chariot
of
solid
pure
gold
drawn
by
two
mules
shining
in
harness
and
trappings
of
gold
no
spot
on
earth
has
been
the
scene
of
such
luxury
cruelty
treachery
murder
infidelity
of
women
and
rapacity
of
men
as
this
site
of
the
old
palace
and
the
long
record
of
the
christian
occasionally
interrupted
anarchy
and
usurpation
of
a
thousand
nothing
in
these
respects
in
comparison
with
the
turkish
occupation
although
the
world
shudders
at
the
unrevealed
secrets
of
the
seraglio
at
least
we
may
suppose
that
nobody
conscience
was
violated
if
a
pretty
woman
was
occasionally
dropped
into
the
bosphorus
and
there
was
the
authority
of
custom
for
the
strangling
of
all
the
children
of
the
sisters
of
the
sultan
so
that
the
succession
might
not
be
embarrassed
in
this
court
is
the
cage
a
room
accessible
only
by
a
window
where
the
royal
children
were
shut
up
to
keep
them
from
conspiracy
against
the
throne
and
there
sultan
abdul
aziz
spent
some
years
of
his
life
we
went
from
the
to
the
ancient
and
large
church
of
irene
which
is
now
the
arsenal
of
the
seraglio
and
become
one
might
say
a
church
militant
the
nave
and
aisles
are
stacked
with
arms
the
walls
the
holy
apse
the
pillars
are
cased
in
guns
swords
pistols
and
armor
arranged
in
fanciful
patterns
and
with
an
ingenuity
i
have
seen
nowhere
else
here
are
preserved
and
famous
trophies
an
armlet
of
tamerlane
a
sword
of
scanderbeg
and
other
pieces
of
cold
pliant
steel
that
have
a
reputation
for
many
murders
there
is
no
way
so
sure
to
universal
celebrity
as
wholesale
murder
adjoining
the
arsenal
is
a
museum
of
greek
and
roman
antiquities
of
the
city
all
in
turkish
disorder
the
cyprus
collections
sent
by
general
di
cesnola
are
flung
upon
shelves
or
lie
in
heaps
unarranged
and
most
of
the
cases
containing
them
had
not
been
opened
near
this
is
an
interesting
museum
of
turkish
costumes
for
the
past
five
hundred
years
on
rows
of
ghastly
wax
figures
clad
in
the
garments
of
the
dead
all
of
them
are
ugly
many
of
them
are
comical
in
their
exaggeration
the
costumes
of
the
janizaries
attract
most
attention
perhaps
from
the
dislike
with
which
we
regard
those
cruel
mercenaries
who
deposed
and
decapitated
sultans
at
their
will
and
partly
because
many
of
the
dresses
seem
more
fit
for
harlequins
or
eunuchs
of
the
harem
than
for
soldiers
when
the
church
of
santa
sophia
the
house
of
divine
wisdom
was
finished
and
justinian
entered
it
accompanied
only
by
the
patriarch
and
ran
from
the
porticos
to
the
pulpit
with
outstretched
arms
crying
i
have
surpassed
thee
it
was
doubtless
the
most
magnificently
decorated
temple
that
had
ever
stood
upon
the
earth
the
exterior
was
as
far
removed
in
simple
grandeur
as
it
was
in
time
from
the
still
matchless
doric
temples
of
athens
and
of
pæstum
or
from
the
ornate
and
lordly
piles
of
but
the
interior
surpassed
in
splendor
almost
the
conception
of
man
the
pagan
temples
of
antiquity
had
been
despoiled
the
quarries
of
the
known
world
had
been
ransacked
for
marbles
of
various
hues
and
textures
to
enrich
it
and
the
gold
the
silver
the
precious
stones
employed
in
its
decoration
surpassed
in
measure
the
barbaric
ostentation
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
among
its
forest
of
columns
one
recognized
the
starred
syenite
from
the
first
cataract
of
the
nile
the
white
marble
of
phrygia
striped
with
rose
the
green
of
laconia
and
the
blue
of
libya
the
black
celtic
and
the
white
bosphorus
polished
shafts
which
had
supported
the
roof
of
the
temple
of
the
delian
apollo
others
which
had
beheld
the
worship
of
diana
at
ephesus
and
of
pallas
athene
on
the
acropolis
and
yet
more
ancient
those
that
had
served
in
the
mysterious
edifices
of
osiris
and
isis
while
more
conspicuous
and
beautiful
than
all
were
the
eight
columns
of
porphyry
which
transported
by
aurelian
from
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
heliopolis
to
home
the
pious
marina
had
received
as
her
dowry
and
dedicated
to
the
most
magnificent
building
ever
reared
to
the
worship
of
the
true
god
and
fitly
dominating
the
shores
of
europe
and
asia
one
reads
of
doors
of
cedar
amber
and
ivory
of
hundreds
of
sacred
vessels
of
pure
gold
of
exquisitely
wrought
golden
candelabra
and
crosses
of
an
hundred
pounds
weight
each
of
a
score
of
books
of
the
evangelists
the
gold
covers
of
which
weighed
twenty
pounds
of
golden
lilies
and
golden
trumpets
of
thousand
embroidered
with
pearls
and
jewels
and
of
the
great
altar
for
which
gold
was
too
cheap
a
material
a
mass
of
the
most
precious
and
costly
stones
imbedded
in
gold
and
silver
we
may
recall
also
the
arches
and
the
clear
spaces
of
the
walls
inlaid
with
marbles
and
covered
with
brilliant
mosaics
it
was
justinian
wish
to
pave
the
floor
with
plates
of
gold
but
restrained
by
the
fear
of
the
avarice
of
his
successors
he
laid
it
in
variegated
marbles
which
run
in
waving
lines
imitating
the
flowing
of
rivers
from
the
four
corners
to
the
vestibules
but
the
wonder
of
the
edifice
was
the
dome
one
hundred
and
seven
feet
in
span
hanging
in
the
air
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
above
the
pavement
the
aerial
lightness
of
its
position
is
increased
by
the
two
of
equal
span
and
the
nine
cupolas
which
surround
it
more
than
one
volume
has
been
exclusively
devoted
to
a
description
of
the
mosque
of
sophia
and
less
than
a
volume
would
not
suffice
but
the
traveller
will
not
see
the
ancient
glories
if
he
expects
anything
approaching
the
exterior
richness
and
grandeur
of
the
cathedrals
of
europe
or
the
colossal
proportions
of
peter
at
rome
or
the
inexhaustible
wealth
of
the
interior
of
mark
at
venice
he
will
be
disappointed
the
area
of
peter
exceeds
that
of
the
grand
piazza
of
mark
while
sophia
is
only
two
hundred
and
feet
broad
by
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
and
while
the
church
of
mark
has
been
accumulating
spoils
of
plunder
and
of
piety
for
centuries
the
church
of
the
divine
wisdom
has
been
ransacked
by
repeated
pillages
and
reduced
to
the
puritan
plainness
of
the
moslem
worship
exceedingly
impressive
however
is
the
first
view
of
the
interior
we
stood
silent
with
wonder
and
delight
in
the
presence
of
the
noble
columns
the
bold
soaring
arches
the
dome
in
the
sky
the
temple
is
flooded
with
light
perhaps
it
is
too
bright
the
old
mosaics
and
paintings
must
have
softened
it
and
we
found
very
offensive
the
arabic
inscriptions
on
the
four
great
arches
written
in
characters
ten
yards
long
they
are
the
names
of
companions
of
the
prophet
but
they
look
like
another
disagreeable
impression
is
produced
by
the
position
of
the
mihrab
or
as
this
must
be
in
the
direction
of
mecca
it
is
placed
at
one
side
of
the
apse
and
everything
in
the
mosque
is
forced
to
conform
to
it
thus
everything
is
askew
the
pulpits
are
set
at
hateful
angles
and
the
stripes
of
the
rugs
on
the
floor
all
run
diagonally
across
when
one
attempts
to
walk
from
the
entrance
pulled
one
way
by
the
architectural
plan
and
the
other
by
the
religious
diversion
of
it
he
has
a
sensation
of
being
intoxicated
gone
from
this
temple
are
the
sacred
relics
which
edified
the
believers
of
former
ages
such
as
the
trumpets
that
blew
down
jericho
and
planks
from
the
ark
of
noah
but
the
moslems
have
prodigies
to
replace
them
the
most
curious
of
these
is
the
sweating
marble
column
which
emits
a
dampness
that
cures
diseases
i
inserted
my
hand
in
a
cavity
which
has
been
dug
in
it
and
certainly
experienced
a
clammy
sensation
it
is
said
to
sweat
most
early
in
the
morning
i
had
the
curiosity
to
ascend
the
gallery
to
see
the
seat
of
the
courtesan
and
empress
theodora
daughter
of
the
keeper
of
the
bears
of
the
circus
public
and
venal
pantomimist
who
after
satisfying
the
immoral
curiosity
of
her
contemporaries
in
many
cities
illustrated
the
throne
of
the
cæsars
by
her
talents
her
intrigues
and
her
devotion
the
fondness
of
justinian
has
preserved
her
initials
in
the
capitals
of
the
columns
the
imperial
eagle
marks
the
screen
that
hid
her
seat
and
the
curious
traveller
may
see
her
name
carved
on
the
balustrade
where
she
sat
to
the
ancient
building
the
moslems
have
added
the
minarets
at
the
four
corners
and
the
enormous
crescent
on
the
dome
the
gilding
of
which
cost
fifty
thousand
ducats
and
the
shining
of
which
a
golden
moon
in
the
day
is
visible
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
miles
the
crescent
adopted
by
the
osmanli
upon
the
conquest
of
jerusalem
was
the
emblem
of
byzantium
before
the
christian
era
there
is
no
spot
in
constantinople
more
flooded
with
historical
associations
or
more
interesting
to
the
student
of
the
history
of
the
eastern
empire
than
the
site
of
sophia
here
arose
the
church
of
the
same
name
erected
by
constantine
it
was
twice
burned
once
by
the
party
of
john
chrysostom
and
once
in
a
tumult
of
the
factions
of
the
hippodrome
i
should
like
to
have
seen
some
of
the
pageants
that
took
place
here
after
reposing
in
their
graves
for
three
centuries
the
bodies
of
andrew
luke
and
timothy
were
transported
hither
fifty
years
after
it
was
honored
by
a
still
more
illustrious
presence
the
ashes
of
the
prophet
samuel
deposited
in
a
golden
vase
covered
with
a
silken
veil
left
their
in
palestine
for
the
banks
of
the
bosphorus
the
highways
from
the
hills
of
judæa
to
the
gates
of
constantinople
were
filled
by
an
uninterrupted
procession
who
testified
their
enthusiasm
and
joy
and
the
emperor
arcadius
himself
attended
by
the
most
illustrious
of
the
clergy
and
the
senate
advanced
to
receive
his
illustrious
guest
and
conducted
the
holy
remains
to
this
magnificent
but
insecure
place
of
repose
it
was
here
that
gregory
nazianzen
was
by
force
installed
upon
the
episcopal
throne
by
theodosius
the
city
was
fanatically
arian
theodosius
proclaimed
the
nicene
creed
and
ordered
the
primate
to
deliver
the
cathedral
and
all
the
churches
to
the
orthodox
who
were
few
in
number
but
strong
in
the
presence
of
gregory
this
extraordinary
man
had
set
up
an
orthodox
pulpit
in
a
private
house
he
had
been
mobbed
by
a
motley
crowd
which
issued
from
the
cathedral
of
sophia
beggars
who
had
forfeited
their
claim
to
pity
monks
who
had
the
appearance
of
goats
or
satyrs
and
women
more
horrible
than
so
many
he
had
his
triumph
when
theodosius
led
him
by
the
hand
through
the
with
a
multitude
crowding
pavement
roofs
and
windows
and
venting
their
rage
grief
astonishment
and
the
church
which
was
held
by
soldiers
though
the
prelate
confessed
that
the
city
had
the
appearance
of
a
town
stormed
by
barbarians
it
was
here
that
eutropius
the
eunuch
when
his
career
of
rapacity
exceeded
even
the
toleration
of
arcadius
sought
sanctuary
and
was
protected
by
john
chrysostom
archbishop
who
owed
his
ecclesiastical
dignity
to
the
late
sexless
favorite
and
it
was
up
this
very
nave
that
mohammed
the
conqueror
spurred
his
horse
through
a
crowd
of
fugitives
dismounted
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
cried
is
no
god
but
god
and
mohammed
is
his
prophet
and
let
loose
his
soldiery
upon
the
priests
virgins
and
promiscuous
multitude
who
had
sought
shelter
here
i
should
only
weary
you
with
unintelligible
details
in
attempting
a
description
of
other
mosques
which
we
visited
they
are
all
somewhat
alike
though
varying
in
degrees
of
splendor
there
is
that
of
sultan
ahmed
on
the
site
of
the
hippodrome
distinguished
as
the
only
one
in
the
empire
that
has
six
minarets
state
mosque
of
the
sultan
whence
the
mecca
pilgrimages
proceed
and
where
the
great
festivals
are
held
from
a
distance
it
is
one
of
the
most
conspicuous
and
poetically
beautiful
objects
in
the
city
and
there
is
the
mosque
of
suleiman
the
magnificent
a
copy
of
sophia
and
excelling
it
in
harmonious
grandeur
it
is
called
the
finest
mosque
in
the
empire
its
forecourt
measures
a
thousand
paces
and
the
enclosure
contains
besides
the
mosque
and
the
tomb
of
the
founder
many
foundations
of
charity
and
of
learning
schools
for
the
young
besides
one
for
the
reading
of
the
koran
and
one
of
medicine
four
academies
for
the
four
moslem
sects
a
hospital
a
kitchen
for
the
poor
a
library
a
fountain
a
for
travellers
and
a
house
of
refuge
for
strangers
from
it
one
enjoys
a
magnificent
view
of
the
golden
horn
the
bosphorus
and
the
city
opposite
when
we
entered
the
mosque
hundreds
of
worshippers
were
at
prayer
bowing
their
turbans
towards
mecca
in
silent
unison
the
throng
soon
broke
up
into
groups
of
from
ten
to
forty
which
seated
themselves
in
circles
on
the
floor
for
the
reading
of
the
koran
the
shoes
were
heaped
in
the
centre
of
each
circle
the
chief
reader
squatted
at
a
low
desk
on
one
side
and
all
read
together
in
a
loud
voice
creating
an
extraordinary
vocal
tumult
it
was
like
a
sunday
school
in
fancy
dress
stamboul
is
a
very
interesting
place
to
those
who
have
a
taste
for
gorgeous
sepulchres
and
i
do
not
know
any
such
pleasant
residences
of
the
dead
as
the
turbehs
or
tombs
of
the
imperial
family
usually
attached
to
the
mosques
but
sometimes
standing
apart
they
are
elegant
edifices
such
as
might
be
suitable
for
the
living
in
their
airy
light
and
stately
chambers
the
occupants
are
deprived
of
no
splendor
to
which
they
were
accustomed
in
life
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
these
turbehs
that
of
sultan
mahmood
i
mistook
for
a
fountain
it
is
a
domed
circular
building
of
white
marble
with
corinthian
pilasters
and
lighted
by
seven
large
windows
with
gilded
grating
within
in
a
cheerful
carpeted
apartment
are
the
biers
of
the
sultan
his
valideh
sultana
and
five
daughters
covered
with
cloths
of
velvet
richly
embroidered
upon
which
are
thrown
the
most
superb
india
shawls
the
principal
sarcophagi
are
surrounded
by
railings
of
massive
silver
candlesticks
and
upon
which
are
beautiful
manuscripts
of
the
koran
are
disposed
about
the
room
and
at
the
head
of
the
sultan
bier
is
a
fez
with
a
plume
and
aigrette
of
diamonds
in
the
court
of
santa
sophia
you
may
see
the
beautiful
mausoleum
of
selim
who
reposes
beside
the
lady
of
light
and
not
far
from
it
the
turbeh
containing
the
remains
of
mohammed
surrounded
by
the
biers
of
seventeen
brothers
whom
he
murdered
it
is
pleasant
to
see
brothers
united
and
in
peace
at
last
i
found
something
pathetic
in
other
like
apartments
where
families
were
gathered
together
sultans
and
sultanas
in
the
midst
of
little
biers
of
sons
and
daughters
incipient
sultans
and
sultanas
who
were
never
permitted
by
state
policy
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
to
hatch
strangled
in
their
golden
cradles
perhaps
these
innocents
worthless
little
bodies
mocked
by
the
splendor
of
their
interments
one
could
not
but
feel
a
little
respect
for
what
might
have
been
a
or
a
light
of
the
seraglio
the
imperial
palace
the
church
of
santa
sophia
the
hippodrome
are
the
triangle
of
byzantine
history
the
trinity
of
tyranny
religion
and
faction
the
circus
of
constantinople
like
that
on
the
banks
of
the
tiber
was
the
arena
for
the
exhibition
of
games
races
spectacles
and
triumphs
like
that
it
was
the
arena
of
a
licentious
democracy
but
the
most
disorderly
mob
of
rome
never
attained
the
power
or
equalled
the
vices
of
the
murderous
and
incendiary
factions
of
byzantium
the
harmless
colors
that
at
first
only
distinguished
the
ignoble
drivers
in
the
chariot
races
became
the
badges
of
parties
which
claimed
the
protection
and
enjoyed
the
favor
of
emperors
and
prelates
and
the
blue
and
the
green
factions
not
only
more
than
once
involved
the
city
in
conflagration
and
blood
but
carried
discord
and
frenzy
into
all
the
provinces
although
they
respected
no
human
or
divine
law
they
affected
religious
zeal
for
one
or
another
christian
sect
or
dogma
the
long
espoused
the
orthodox
cause
and
enjoyed
the
partiality
of
justinian
the
dissolute
youth
of
constantinople
wearing
the
livery
of
the
factions
possessed
the
city
at
night
and
abandoned
themselves
to
any
deed
of
violence
that
fancy
or
revenge
suggested
neither
the
sanctity
of
the
church
nor
the
peace
of
the
private
house
nor
the
innocence
of
youth
nor
the
chastity
of
matron
or
maid
was
safe
from
these
assassins
and
ravishers
it
was
in
one
of
their
seditious
outbreaks
that
the
palace
and
santa
sophia
were
delivered
to
the
flames
the
oblong
ground
of
the
hippodrome
is
still
an
open
place
although
a
portion
of
the
ground
is
covered
by
the
mosque
of
ahmed
but
the
traveller
will
find
there
few
relics
of
this
historical
arena
nothing
of
the
marble
seats
and
galleries
that
surrounded
it
the
curious
may
look
at
the
egyptian
obelisk
of
syenite
at
the
crumbling
pyramid
which
was
the
turning
goal
of
the
chariots
and
he
may
find
more
food
for
reflection
in
the
bronze
spiral
column
formed
by
the
twinings
of
three
serpents
whose
heads
have
been
knocked
off
it
deserves
to
be
housed
and
cared
for
there
is
no
doubt
of
its
venerable
antiquity
it
was
seen
by
thucydides
and
herodotus
in
the
temple
of
delphi
where
its
three
branching
heads
formed
a
tripod
upon
which
rested
the
dish
of
gold
which
the
greeks
captured
among
the
spoils
of
the
battle
of
platæa
the
column
is
not
more
than
fifteen
feet
high
it
has
stood
here
since
the
time
of
constantine
this
is
the
most
famous
square
of
constantinople
yet
in
its
present
unromantic
aspect
it
is
difficult
to
reanimate
its
interest
it
is
said
that
its
statues
of
marble
and
bronze
once
excelled
the
living
population
of
the
city
in
its
arena
emperors
whose
vices
have
alone
saved
their
names
to
a
conspicuous
contempt
sought
the
popular
applause
by
driving
in
the
chariot
races
or
stripped
themselves
for
the
sports
with
wild
beasts
proud
to
remind
the
spectators
of
the
exploits
of
caligula
and
heliogabalus
here
in
the
reign
of
anastasius
the
faction
entering
the
place
with
concealed
daggers
interrupted
a
solemn
festival
and
assassinated
three
thousand
of
the
this
place
was
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
century
the
exercise
and
parade
ground
of
the
janizaries
until
they
were
destroyed
let
us
do
justice
to
the
turks
in
two
memorable
instances
they
exhibited
a
nerve
which
the
roman
emperors
lacked
who
never
had
either
the
firmness
or
the
courage
to
extirpate
the
prætorian
guards
the
janizaries
set
up
deposed
murdered
sultans
as
the
guards
did
emperors
and
the
mamelukes
of
egypt
imitated
their
predecessors
at
rome
mahmood
ii
in
constantinople
and
mohammed
ali
in
cairo
had
the
courage
to
extinguish
these
enemies
of
turkish
sovereignty
in
this
neighborhood
are
several
ancient
monuments
the
burnt
column
a
blackened
shaft
of
porphyry
the
column
called
historical
and
that
of
theodosius
shall
not
fatigue
you
with
further
mention
of
them
not
far
from
the
hippodrome
we
descended
into
the
reservoir
called
a
thousand
and
one
columns
i
suppose
this
number
is
made
up
by
counting
one
as
three
for
each
column
consists
of
three
superimposed
shafts
it
is
only
partially
excavated
we
found
a
number
of
jews
occupying
these
subterranean
colonnades
engaged
in
twisting
silk
the
even
temperature
of
the
cellar
being
favorable
to
this
work
as
if
we
had
come
out
of
a
day
in
another
age
we
walked
down
through
the
streets
of
the
artificers
of
brass
and
ivory
and
leather
to
the
floating
bridge
and
crossed
in
a
golden
sunset
in
which
the
minarets
and
domes
of
the
mosque
of
mohammed
ii
appeared
like
some
aerial
creation
in
the
yellow
sky
about
constantinople
during
the
day
steamers
leave
the
galata
bridge
every
halfhour
for
the
villages
and
palaces
along
the
bosphorus
there
is
a
large
fleet
of
them
probably
thirty
but
they
are
always
crowded
like
the
that
ply
the
waters
of
new
york
bay
we
took
our
first
sail
on
the
bosphorus
one
afternoon
toward
sunset
ascending
as
far
as
bebek
where
we
had
been
invited
to
spend
the
night
by
washburne
the
president
of
roberts
college
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
animation
of
the
harbor
crowded
with
shipping
amid
which
the
steamers
and
caïques
were
darting
about
like
shuttles
the
first
impression
made
by
the
palaces
and
ravishingly
lovely
shores
of
this
winding
artery
between
two
seas
seven
promontories
from
asia
and
seven
promontories
from
europe
project
into
the
stream
creating
as
many
corresponding
bays
but
the
villages
are
more
numerous
than
bays
and
promontories
together
for
there
are
over
forty
in
the
fourteen
miles
from
the
sea
of
marmora
to
the
black
sea
on
the
shores
is
an
almost
unbroken
line
of
buildings
many
of
them
palaces
of
marble
the
heights
are
crowned
with
cottages
and
luxurious
villas
and
abodes
of
taste
and
wealth
peep
out
along
the
slopes
if
you
say
that
we
seem
to
be
sailing
in
the
street
of
a
city
i
can
only
answer
that
it
is
not
so
nature
is
still
supreme
here
and
the
visible
doweress
of
the
scene
these
lovely
hills
rising
on
both
sides
these
gracious
curves
are
hers
as
are
these
groves
and
gardens
of
fruits
and
flowers
these
vines
and
the
abundant
green
that
sometimes
conceals
and
always
softens
the
work
of
man
before
we
reached
the
sultan
palace
at
beshiktash
our
steamer
made
a
détour
to
the
east
bank
outside
of
the
grim
ironclads
that
lie
before
the
imperial
residence
no
steamers
are
permitted
to
approach
nearer
lest
the
smoke
should
soil
the
sparkling
white
marble
of
the
palace
or
their
clamor
and
dangerous
freight
of
men
should
disturb
the
serenity
of
the
harem
the
palace
which
is
a
beautiful
building
stretches
for
some
distance
along
the
water
with
its
gardens
and
conservatories
and
seems
to
be
a
very
comfortable
home
for
a
man
who
has
no
more
ready
money
than
the
sultan
we
landed
at
bebek
and
climbed
the
steep
hill
on
whose
slope
nightingales
were
singing
in
the
forest
just
in
time
to
see
the
sunset
roberts
college
occupies
the
most
commanding
situation
on
the
strait
and
i
do
not
know
any
view
that
surpasses
in
varied
beauty
that
to
be
enjoyed
from
it
i
shall
make
myself
comprehended
by
many
when
i
say
that
it
strongly
reminded
me
of
the
hudson
at
west
point
if
nature
could
be
suspected
of
copying
herself
i
should
say
that
she
had
the
one
in
mind
when
she
made
the
other
at
that
point
the
hudson
resembles
the
bosphorus
but
it
wants
the
palaces
the
yale
of
the
heavenly
water
into
which
we
looked
from
this
height
and
some
charming
mediaeval
towers
walls
and
castles
the
towers
and
walls
belong
to
the
fortress
built
in
by
mohammed
and
are
now
fallen
into
that
decrepitude
in
which
i
like
best
to
see
all
fortresses
but
this
was
interesting
before
it
was
a
ruin
it
stands
just
above
the
college
at
roomeli
hissar
where
the
bosphorus
is
narrowest
more
than
half
a
mile
broad
with
the
opposite
fortress
of
anatolia
could
perfectly
close
the
stream
two
years
before
the
capture
of
the
city
mohammed
built
this
fort
and
gave
it
the
most
peculiar
form
of
any
fortress
existing
his
idea
was
that
the
towers
and
the
circuit
of
the
walls
should
spell
the
name
of
the
prophet
and
consequently
his
own
as
we
looked
down
upon
it
my
friend
read
for
me
this
singular
piece
of
caligraphy
but
i
could
understand
it
no
further
than
the
tower
which
stands
for
the
arabic
ring
in
the
first
letter
it
was
at
this
place
that
darius
threw
a
bridge
across
the
bosphorus
and
there
is
a
tradition
of
a
stone
seat
which
he
occupied
here
while
his
asiatics
passed
into
europe
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
other
stream
in
the
world
upon
which
the
wealth
of
palaces
and
the
beauty
of
gardens
may
be
so
advantageously
displayed
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
other
place
where
nature
and
art
have
so
combined
to
produce
an
enchanting
prospect
as
the
situation
and
appearance
of
constantinople
are
unequalled
so
the
bosphorus
is
unique
whatever
may
be
the
political
changes
of
the
turkish
empire
i
do
not
believe
that
this
pleasing
picture
will
be
destroyed
rather
let
us
expect
to
see
it
more
lovely
in
the
rapidly
developing
taste
of
a
new
era
of
letters
and
refinement
it
was
a
wise
forethought
that
planted
the
american
college
just
here
it
is
just
where
it
should
be
to
mould
the
new
order
of
things
i
saw
among
its
two
hundred
pupils
scholars
of
all
creeds
and
races
who
will
carry
from
here
living
ideas
to
every
part
of
the
empire
and
i
learned
to
respect
that
thirst
for
knowledge
and
ability
to
acquire
it
which
exist
in
the
neighboring
european
provinces
if
impatient
men
could
wait
the
process
of
education
the
growth
of
schools
and
the
development
of
capacity
now
already
most
promising
the
eastern
question
might
be
solved
by
the
appearance
on
the
scene
in
less
than
a
score
of
years
of
a
stalwart
and
intelligent
people
who
would
not
only
be
able
to
grasp
constantinople
but
to
administer
upon
the
decaying
turkish
empire
as
the
osmanli
administered
upon
the
greek
on
friday
the
great
business
of
everybody
is
to
see
the
sultan
go
to
pray
and
the
eagerness
with
which
foreigners
crowd
to
the
spectacle
must
convince
the
turks
that
we
enjoy
few
religious
privileges
at
home
it
is
not
known
beforehand
even
to
the
inmates
of
the
palace
to
what
mosque
the
sultan
will
go
nor
whether
he
will
make
a
street
progress
on
horseback
or
embark
upon
the
water
for
the
chosen
place
of
prayer
before
twelve
we
took
carriage
and
drove
down
the
hill
past
the
and
the
artillery
barracks
to
the
rear
of
the
palace
of
beshiktash
crowds
on
foot
and
in
carriages
were
streaming
in
that
direction
regiments
of
troops
were
drifting
down
the
slopes
and
emptying
into
the
avenue
that
leads
between
the
palace
and
the
plantation
of
gardens
colors
were
unfurled
drums
beaten
trumpets
called
from
barrack
and
gorgeous
officers
on
caparisoned
horses
with
equally
gaudy
attendants
cantered
to
the
rendezvous
and
all
the
air
was
full
of
the
expectation
of
a
great
event
at
the
great
square
of
the
palace
we
waited
amid
an
intense
throng
four
or
five
lines
of
carriages
stretched
for
a
mile
along
troops
were
in
marching
rank
along
the
avenue
and
disposed
in
hollow
square
on
the
place
the
palace
gates
were
closed
and
everybody
looked
anxiously
toward
the
high
and
gilded
portal
from
which
it
was
said
the
announcement
of
the
sultan
intention
would
be
made
from
time
to
time
our
curiosity
was
fed
by
the
arrival
of
a
splendid
pasha
who
dismounted
and
walked
about
and
at
intervals
a
gilded
personage
emerged
from
the
palace
court
and
raised
our
expectation
on
tiptoe
we
send
our
dragoman
to
interrogate
the
most
awful
dignities
especially
some
superb
beings
in
yellow
silk
and
gold
but
they
know
nothing
of
the
sultan
mind
at
the
last
moment
he
might
on
horseback
issue
from
the
gate
with
a
brilliant
throng
or
he
might
depart
in
his
caïque
by
the
water
front
in
either
case
there
would
be
a
rush
and
a
scramble
to
see
and
to
accompany
him
more
regiments
were
arriving
bands
were
playing
superb
officers
galloping
up
and
down
carriages
gilded
with
the
arms
of
foreign
embassies
or
filled
with
turkish
ladies
pressed
forward
to
the
great
gate
which
still
gave
no
sign
i
have
never
seen
such
a
religious
excitement
for
myself
i
found
some
compensation
in
the
usual
oriental
crowd
and
unconscious
picturesqueness
swart
africans
in
garments
of
yellow
sellers
of
sherbet
clinking
their
glasses
venders
of
faint
sweetmeats
walking
about
with
trays
and
tripods
and
the
shifting
kaleidoscope
of
races
colors
and
graceful
attitudes
suddenly
i
do
not
know
how
or
from
what
quarter
the
i
could
not
call
it
diffused
that
the
successor
of
the
prophet
would
pray
at
the
mosque
in
ortakeui
and
that
he
would
go
by
caïque
and
we
all
scampered
up
the
road
a
mile
or
two
racing
carriages
troops
and
foot
men
in
eager
outset
in
order
to
arrive
before
the
pious
man
the
mosque
stands
upon
the
bosphorus
where
its
broad
marble
steps
and
pillared
front
and
dome
occupy
as
conspicuous
a
position
as
the
dogana
at
venice
we
secured
a
on
the
dock
close
to
the
landing
but
outside
the
iron
railing
and
waited
a
cordon
of
troops
in
blue
regimentals
with
red
facings
was
drawn
around
the
streets
in
the
rear
of
the
mosque
and
two
companies
of
soldiers
in
white
had
stacked
their
guns
on
the
marble
landing
and
were
lounging
about
in
front
of
the
building
the
scene
on
the
bosphorus
was
as
gay
as
a
the
water
was
covered
with
graceful
caiques
and
painted
barges
and
every
sort
of
craft
mean
and
splendid
that
could
be
propelled
by
oars
or
sails
a
dozen
were
decked
with
flags
from
keel
to
maintop
on
every
yard
and
from
bowsprit
to
stern
stood
a
line
of
sailors
sharply
defined
against
the
blue
sky
at
one
a
cannon
announced
that
the
superior
devotee
had
entered
his
caique
and
then
from
every
vessel
of
war
in
the
harbor
salute
answered
salute
in
thunder
that
awoke
the
echoes
of
two
continents
until
on
all
the
broad
water
lay
a
thick
through
which
we
could
distinguish
only
the
tops
of
the
masts
and
the
dim
hulks
spouting
fire
in
the
midst
of
this
earthquake
of
piety
there
was
a
cry
comes
he
comes
the
soldiers
grasped
their
arms
and
drew
a
line
each
side
of
the
landing
and
the
officials
of
the
mosque
arranged
themselves
on
the
steps
upon
the
water
advancing
with
the
speed
of
we
saw
two
splendid
gilded
caïques
the
one
containing
the
sultan
the
other
his
attendants
at
the
moment
a
light
carriage
with
two
bay
horses
unattended
dashed
up
to
the
side
door
and
there
descended
from
it
and
entered
the
mosque
the
imperial
heir
the
son
of
the
late
sultan
and
the
nephew
of
the
present
a
slender
pale
youth
of
apparently
or
thirty
years
we
turn
not
knowing
how
soon
he
is
to
become
sultan
murad
our
eyes
to
him
only
for
a
moment
for
the
sultan
caique
comes
with
imperious
haste
with
the
rush
as
it
were
of
victory
hundred
feet
long
narrow
rising
at
the
stern
like
the
venetian
bucentaur
carved
and
gilded
like
the
golden
chariot
in
which
alexander
entered
babylon
by
long
sweeps
rising
and
falling
in
unison
with
the
bending
backs
of
black
rowers
clad
in
white
and
with
naked
feet
the
sultan
is
throned
in
the
high
stern
hung
with
silk
on
silken
cushions
under
a
splendid
canopy
on
the
top
of
which
glisten
his
arms
and
a
blazing
sun
the
sultan
who
is
clad
in
the
uniform
of
a
general
steps
quickly
out
walks
up
the
steps
over
a
carpet
spread
for
his
royal
feet
soldiers
saluting
everybody
with
arms
crossed
bending
the
body
disappears
in
the
mosque
the
second
caique
lands
immediately
and
the
imperial
ministers
step
from
it
and
follow
their
master
at
the
side
entrance
an
immense
closed
drawn
by
four
horses
and
said
to
contain
the
sacred
wardrobe
was
then
unlocked
and
unloaded
and
out
of
it
came
trunks
boxes
carpetbags
as
if
the
imperial
visitor
had
come
to
stay
a
week
after
a
of
prayer
he
came
out
his
uniform
concealed
under
his
overcoat
got
quickly
into
a
plain
carriage
drawn
by
four
magnificent
gray
horses
and
drove
rapidly
away
attended
by
a
dozen
outriders
his
heir
followed
in
the
carriage
in
which
he
came
we
had
a
good
view
of
the
chief
of
islam
he
was
a
tall
stout
man
with
a
full
gray
beard
and
on
the
whole
a
good
face
and
figure
all
this
parade
is
weekly
enacted
over
one
man
going
to
pray
it
is
after
all
more
simple
than
the
pageantry
that
often
attends
the
public
devotion
of
the
vicegerent
of
christ
in
peter
upon
our
return
we
stopped
at
the
tekkeb
in
pera
to
see
the
performance
of
the
turning
darwishes
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
anything
to
add
to
the
many
animated
descriptions
which
have
been
written
of
it
it
is
not
far
from
the
little
field
of
the
dead
and
all
about
the
building
are
tombs
of
the
faithful
in
which
were
crowds
of
people
enjoying
that
peculiar
oriental
pleasure
graveyard
festivity
the
mosque
is
pleasant
and
has
a
polished
surrounded
by
a
gallery
supported
on
columns
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
place
for
a
everybody
has
seen
a
picture
of
the
darwishes
with
closed
eyes
outstretched
arms
and
long
gowns
inflated
at
the
bottom
like
an
churn
turning
smoothly
round
upon
their
toes
a
dozen
or
twenty
of
them
revolving
without
collision
the
motion
is
certainly
poetic
and
pleasing
and
the
plaintive
fluting
of
the
arab
nay
adds
i
know
not
what
of
pathos
to
the
exercise
i
think
this
dance
might
advantageously
be
substituted
in
western
salons
for
the
german
for
it
is
graceful
and
perfectly
moral
constantinople
is
a
city
of
the
dead
as
much
as
of
the
living
and
one
encounters
everywhere
tombs
and
cemeteries
sentinelled
by
the
mournful
cypress
on
our
way
to
take
boat
for
the
sweet
waters
of
europe
we
descended
through
the
neglected
little
field
of
the
dead
it
is
on
a
steep
acclivity
and
the
stones
stand
and
lean
thickly
there
each
surmounted
by
a
turban
in
fashion
at
the
period
of
the
death
and
with
inscription
neatly
carved
that
man
has
his
strikes
as
a
remarkable
fact
the
ground
is
netted
by
haphazard
paths
and
the
careless
living
tread
the
graves
with
thoughtless
feet
as
if
the
rights
of
the
dead
to
their
scanty
bit
of
soil
were
no
longer
respected
we
said
to
the
boatman
that
this
did
not
seem
well
there
was
a
weary
touch
of
philosophy
in
his
reply
master
the
world
grows
old
it
is
the
fashion
for
the
world
to
go
on
friday
to
the
sweet
waters
of
europe
the
inlet
of
the
golden
horn
flowing
down
between
two
ranges
of
hills
this
vale
which
is
almost
as
celebrated
in
poetry
as
that
of
the
heavenly
water
on
the
asiatic
shore
is
resorted
to
by
thousands
in
hundreds
of
carriages
from
fera
in
thousands
of
caïques
and
barges
on
the
water
the
excursion
is
a
festival
of
the
people
of
strangers
of
adventurers
of
both
sexes
the
more
fashionable
though
not
moral
part
of
society
who
have
equipages
to
display
go
by
land
we
chose
the
water
and
selected
a
large
caïque
in
the
bottom
of
which
we
seated
ourselves
after
a
dozen
narrow
escapes
from
upsetting
the
tottlish
craft
and
rowed
away
with
the
grave
balanced
behind
and
under
bonds
to
preserve
his
exact
equilibrium
all
the
city
seems
to
be
upon
the
water
the
stream
is
alive
with
the
slender
swift
caïques
family
parties
rollicking
midshipmen
from
some
foreign
vessel
solitary
beauties
reclining
in
selfish
loveliness
grave
fat
turks
in
stupid
enjoyment
no
voyage
could
be
gayer
than
this
through
the
shipping
with
the
multitudinous
houses
of
the
city
rising
on
either
hand
as
we
advance
the
shore
is
lined
with
people
mostly
ladies
in
gay
holiday
apparel
squatting
along
the
stream
as
on
a
spring
day
in
paris
those
who
can
not
afford
carriages
line
the
avenues
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
to
watch
the
passing
pageant
the
stream
grows
more
narrow
at
length
winds
in
graceful
turns
and
finally
is
only
a
few
yards
wide
and
the
banks
are
retained
by
masonry
the
vale
narrows
also
and
the
hills
draw
near
the
is
choked
with
gayly
painted
caiques
full
of
laughing
beauties
and
reckless
and
the
reader
of
egyptian
history
might
think
himself
in
a
saturnalia
of
the
in
the
ancient
fête
of
bubastis
on
the
nile
the
women
are
clad
in
soft
silks
red
pink
yellow
and
gray
of
them
with
their
faces
tied
up
as
if
they
were
victims
of
toothache
others
wearing
the
gauze
veils
which
enhance
without
concealing
charms
and
the
color
and
beauty
that
nature
has
denied
to
many
are
imitated
by
paint
and
enamel
we
land
and
walk
on
singers
and
players
on
curious
instruments
sit
along
the
bank
and
in
groups
under
the
trees
and
fill
the
festive
air
with
the
plaintive
and
untrained
oriental
music
the
variety
of
costumes
is
infinite
here
we
meet
all
that
is
gay
and
fantastic
in
europe
and
asia
the
navigation
ends
at
the
white
marble
palace
and
mosque
which
we
now
see
shining
amid
the
trees
fresh
with
may
foliage
booths
and
tents
green
and
white
are
erected
everywhere
and
there
are
many
groups
of
gypsies
and
the
women
who
trade
in
the
secrets
of
the
orient
and
the
vices
of
the
occident
do
a
thriving
business
with
those
curious
of
the
future
or
fascinated
by
the
mysterious
beauty
of
the
soothsayers
besides
the
bands
of
music
there
are
solitary
bagpipers
whose
instrument
is
a
skin
with
a
pipe
for
a
mouthpiece
and
another
at
the
opposite
end
having
graduated
holes
for
fingering
and
i
noticed
with
pleasure
that
the
fingering
and
the
music
continued
long
after
the
musician
had
ceased
to
blow
into
the
inflated
skin
nothing
was
wanting
to
the
most
brilliant
scene
ladies
in
bright
groups
on
gay
rugs
and
mats
children
weaving
from
leaves
and
rushes
crowds
of
carriages
fine
horses
and
gallant
horsemen
sellers
of
refreshments
balancing
great
trays
on
their
heads
and
bearing
tripod
stools
and
all
degrees
of
the
most
cosmopolitan
capital
enjoying
the
charming
spring
holiday
in
the
palace
grounds
dozens
of
peacocks
were
sunning
themselves
and
the
were
in
full
pink
bloom
above
the
palace
the
river
flows
in
walled
banks
and
before
it
reaches
it
tumbles
over
an
artificial
fall
of
rocks
and
sweeps
round
the
garden
in
a
graceful
curve
beyond
the
palace
also
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
is
a
grove
of
superb
trees
and
a
greensward
here
a
military
band
plays
and
this
is
the
fashionable
of
carriages
where
hundreds
were
circling
round
and
round
in
the
imitated
etiquette
of
hyde
park
we
came
down
at
sunset
racing
swiftly
among
the
returning
caïques
passing
and
passed
by
laughing
boatsful
whose
gay
hangings
trailed
in
the
stream
as
in
a
pageant
on
the
grand
canal
of
venice
and
watching
with
the
interest
of
the
philosopher
only
the
light
boat
of
beauty
and
frailty
pursued
by
the
youthful
caique
of
inexperience
and
desire
the
hour
contributed
to
make
the
scene
one
of
magical
beauty
to
our
right
lay
the
dark
cypresses
of
the
vast
cemetery
of
eyoub
or
ayub
and
the
shining
mosque
where
at
their
inauguration
the
osmanli
sultans
are
still
girt
with
the
sword
of
their
founder
at
this
spot
in
the
first
siege
of
constantinople
by
the
arabs
fell
amid
thirty
thousand
moslems
slain
outside
the
golden
gate
the
aboo
ayub
or
job
one
of
the
last
companions
of
the
prophet
he
was
one
of
the
immortal
auxiliaries
he
had
fought
at
beder
and
obud
side
by
side
with
abubeker
and
he
had
the
honor
to
be
one
of
the
first
assailants
of
the
christian
capital
which
mohammed
had
predicted
that
his
followers
should
one
day
possess
the
site
of
his
grave
forgotten
for
seven
centuries
was
revealed
to
the
conqueror
of
the
city
by
a
fortunate
vision
and
the
spot
was
commemorated
by
a
mosque
and
a
gathering
congregation
of
the
dead
clouds
had
collected
in
the
west
and
the
heavy
smoke
of
innumerable
steamers
lay
dark
upon
the
bosphorus
but
as
we
came
down
the
sun
broke
out
and
gave
us
one
of
those
effects
of
which
nature
is
sparing
on
the
heights
of
stamboul
a
dozen
minarets
only
half
distinct
were
touched
by
the
gold
rays
the
windows
of
both
cities
piled
above
each
other
blazed
in
it
the
smooth
river
and
the
swift
caiques
were
gilded
by
it
and
behind
us
domes
and
spires
and
the
tapering
shafts
of
the
muezzin
the
bases
hid
by
the
mist
rose
into
the
heaven
of
the
golden
sunset
and
appeared
like
mansions
and
most
unsubstantial
ones
in
the
sky
and
ever
the
light
caiques
flew
over
the
rosy
water
in
a
chase
of
pleasure
in
a
motion
that
satisfied
the
utmost
longing
for
repose
while
the
enchantment
of
heaven
seemed
to
have
dropped
upon
the
earth
world
has
lost
its
gloss
for
us
since
we
went
boating
on
the
constantinople
enjoys
or
suffers
the
changeable
weather
appropriate
to
its
cosmopolitan
inhabitants
and
situation
and
we
waited
for
a
day
suitable
to
cross
to
scutari
and
obtain
the
view
from
boolgoorloo
we
finally
accepted
one
of
alternate
clouds
and
sunshine
the
connection
between
the
european
city
and
its
great
suburb
is
maintained
by
frequent
and
i
believe
that
no
other
in
the
world
can
offer
the
traveller
a
scene
more
animated
or
views
so
varied
and
magnificent
near
the
landing
at
scutari
stands
a
feet
high
erected
upon
a
rock
it
has
the
name
of
the
maiden
tower
but
i
do
not
know
why
unless
by
courtesy
to
one
of
the
mistresses
of
sultan
mohammed
who
is
said
to
have
been
shut
up
in
it
scutari
with
the
accent
on
the
first
syllable
a
corruption
of
the
turkish
name
uskudar
site
of
the
old
greek
and
persian
chrysopolis
is
a
town
sprawling
over
seven
hills
has
plenty
of
mosques
baths
and
cemeteries
three
oriental
luxuries
little
to
detain
the
traveller
already
familiar
with
eastern
towns
of
the
sort
the
spot
has
been
in
all
ages
an
arriving
and
starting
point
for
asiatic
couriers
caravans
and
armies
here
the
earliest
greek
hauled
up
their
venturous
barks
here
xenophon
rested
after
his
campaign
against
cyrus
here
the
roman
and
then
the
byzantine
emperors
had
their
here
for
a
long
time
the
persians
menaced
and
wrung
tribute
from
the
city
they
could
not
capture
we
took
a
carriage
and
ascended
through
the
city
to
the
mountain
of
boolgoorloo
on
the
slopes
above
the
town
are
orchards
and
vineyards
and
pretty
villas
the
last
ten
minutes
of
the
climb
was
accomplished
on
foot
and
when
we
stood
upon
the
summit
the
world
was
at
our
feet
i
do
not
know
any
other
view
that
embraces
so
much
and
such
variety
the
swelling
top
was
carpeted
with
grass
sprinkled
with
spring
flowers
and
here
and
there
a
spreading
pine
offered
a
place
of
shade
and
repose
behind
us
continued
range
on
range
the
hills
of
the
peninsula
to
the
south
the
eye
explored
asia
minor
the
ancient
bithynia
and
mysia
until
it
rested
on
the
monstrous
snowy
summits
of
olympus
which
rears
itself
beyond
broussa
city
famed
for
its
gauzy
silk
and
the
first
capital
of
the
osman
dynasty
there
stretches
the
blue
sea
of
marmora
bearing
lightly
on
the
surface
the
nine
enchanting
princes
islands
whose
equable
climate
and
fertile
soil
have
obtained
for
them
the
epithet
of
the
isles
of
the
blest
opposite
stamboul
rises
out
of
the
water
on
every
side
in
the
distance
a
city
of
domes
and
pinnacles
and
glass
the
spires
of
cypress
tempering
its
brilliant
lustre
there
the
golden
horn
and
its
thronged
bridges
and
its
countless
masts
and
steamers
funnels
galata
and
pera
also
lifted
up
into
nobility
and
all
their
shabby
details
lost
and
the
bosphorus
its
hills
marble
palaces
mosques
and
gardens
on
either
side
i
do
not
know
any
scene
that
approaches
this
in
beauty
except
the
bay
of
naples
and
the
charm
of
that
is
so
different
from
this
that
no
comparison
is
forced
upon
the
mind
the
bay
of
new
york
has
many
of
the
elements
of
this
charming
prospect
on
the
map
but
constantinople
and
its
environs
can
be
seen
from
many
points
in
one
view
while
one
would
need
to
ascend
a
balloon
to
comprehend
in
like
manner
the
capital
of
the
western
world
it
is
the
situation
of
constantinople
lifted
up
into
a
conspicuousness
that
permits
no
one
of
its
single
splendors
to
be
lost
in
the
general
view
that
makes
it
in
appearance
the
unrivalled
empress
of
cities
in
the
foreground
lay
scutari
and
in
a
broad
sweep
the
heavy
mass
of
cypress
forest
that
covers
the
great
cemetery
of
the
turks
which
they
are
said
to
prefer
to
eyoub
under
the
prophetic
impression
that
they
will
one
day
be
driven
out
of
europe
the
precaution
seems
idle
if
in
the
loss
of
constantinople
the
osmanli
sultans
still
maintain
the
supremacy
of
islam
the
moslem
capital
could
not
he
on
these
shores
and
the
caliphate
in
its
migrations
might
again
he
established
on
the
nile
on
the
euphrates
or
in
the
plains
of
guta
on
the
abana
the
that
lie
in
the
bosphorus
the
long
guns
of
a
dozen
fortresses
that
command
every
foot
of
the
city
and
shore
forbid
that
these
contiguous
coasts
should
fly
hostile
flags
we
drove
down
to
and
through
this
famous
cemetery
in
one
direction
and
another
in
its
beauty
i
was
disappointed
it
is
a
dense
and
gloomy
cypress
forest
as
a
place
of
sepulture
without
the
architectural
pretensions
of
and
only
less
attractive
than
that
its
dark
recesses
are
crowded
with
gravestones
slender
at
the
bottom
and
swelling
at
the
top
painted
in
lively
colors
red
and
gray
a
necessary
relief
to
the
sombre
woods
inscriptions
in
gilt
and
red
letters
and
leaning
at
all
angles
as
if
they
had
fallen
out
in
a
quarrel
over
night
the
graves
of
the
men
are
distinguished
by
stones
crowned
with
turbans
or
with
tarbooshes
painted
red
imitation
in
short
of
whatever
the
owner
wore
when
alive
so
that
perhaps
his
acquaintances
can
recognize
his
tomb
without
reading
his
name
some
of
the
more
ancient
have
the
form
of
a
mould
of
charlotte
busse
i
saw
more
than
one
set
jauntily
on
one
side
which
gave
the
monument
a
rakish
air
singularly
débonnaire
for
a
tombstone
in
contrast
to
this
vast
assembly
of
the
faithful
is
the
pretty
english
cemetery
dedicated
to
the
fallen
in
the
crimean
war
which
lies
close
to
the
bosphorus
on
a
point
opposite
the
old
seraglio
we
sat
down
on
the
in
this
quiet
spot
where
the
sun
falls
lovingly
and
the
undisturbed
birds
sing
and
looked
long
at
the
shifting
busy
panorama
of
a
world
that
does
not
disturb
this
repose
and
then
walked
about
the
garden
noting
the
headstones
of
soldiers
one
killed
at
alma
that
at
inkermann
another
at
balaklava
and
the
tall
graceless
granite
monument
to
eight
thousand
nameless
dead
nameless
here
but
not
in
many
a
home
and
many
a
heart
any
more
than
the
undistinguished
thousands
who
sleep
at
gettysburg
or
on
a
hundred
other
patriot
fields
near
by
is
the
great
hospital
which
florence
nightingale
controlled
and
in
her
memory
we
asked
permission
to
enter
its
wards
and
visit
its
garden
after
some
delay
this
was
granted
but
the
turkish
official
said
that
the
hospital
was
for
men
that
there
was
no
woman
there
and
as
for
miss
nightingale
he
had
never
heard
of
her
but
we
persevered
and
finally
found
an
officer
who
led
us
to
the
room
she
occupied
large
apartment
now
filled
with
the
beds
of
the
sick
and
like
every
other
part
of
the
establishment
neat
and
orderly
but
our
curiosity
to
see
where
the
philanthropist
had
labored
was
an
enigma
to
the
turkish
officials
to
the
last
they
insisted
at
first
that
we
must
be
relations
of
miss
nightingale
supposition
which
i
saw
that
who
always
seeks
the
advantage
of
distinction
was
inclined
to
favor
but
we
said
no
well
perhaps
it
was
natural
that
englishmen
should
indulge
in
the
sentiment
that
moved
us
but
we
were
not
englishmen
we
were
americans
gave
it
up
entirely
the
superintendent
of
the
hospital
a
courtly
and
elderly
bey
who
had
fought
in
the
crimean
war
and
whom
our
dragoman
dipping
his
hand
to
the
ground
saluted
with
the
most
profound
egyptian
obeisance
insisted
upon
serving
us
coffee
in
the
garden
by
the
fountain
of
and
we
spent
an
hour
of
quiet
there
on
sunday
at
about
the
hour
that
the
good
people
in
america
were
beginning
to
think
what
they
should
wear
to
church
we
walked
down
to
the
service
in
the
english
memorial
church
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
in
pera
a
pointed
gothic
building
of
a
rich
and
pleasing
interior
only
once
or
twice
in
many
months
had
we
been
in
a
christian
church
and
it
was
at
least
interesting
to
contrast
its
simple
forms
with
the
elaborate
greek
ritual
and
the
endless
repetitions
of
the
moslem
prayers
a
choir
of
boys
intoned
or
chanted
a
portion
of
the
service
with
marked
ability
and
wholly
relieved
the
audience
of
the
necessity
of
making
responses
the
clergymen
executed
the
reading
so
successfully
that
we
could
only
now
and
then
catch
a
word
the
service
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
might
as
well
have
been
in
turkish
and
yet
it
was
not
altogether
lost
on
us
we
could
distinguish
occasionally
the
prayer
and
the
name
of
queen
victoria
and
we
caught
some
of
the
commandments
as
they
whisked
past
us
we
knew
also
when
we
were
in
the
litany
from
the
regular
cadence
of
the
boys
responses
but
as
the
entertainment
seemed
to
be
for
the
benefit
of
the
clergymen
and
boys
i
did
not
feel
like
intruding
beyond
the
office
of
a
spectator
and
i
soon
found
myself
reflecting
whether
a
machine
could
not
be
invented
that
should
produce
the
same
effect
of
sound
which
was
all
that
the
congregation
enjoyed
rome
has
been
until
recently
less
tolerant
of
the
protestant
faith
than
constantinople
and
it
was
an
inspiration
of
reciprocity
to
build
here
a
church
in
memory
of
the
christian
soldiers
who
fell
in
the
crusade
to
establish
the
moslem
rule
in
european
turkey
of
the
various
views
about
constantinople
we
always
pronounced
that
best
which
we
saw
last
and
at
the
time
we
said
that
those
from
seraglio
point
from
boolgoorloo
and
from
roberts
college
were
crowned
by
that
from
giant
grave
mountain
a
noble
height
on
the
asiatic
side
of
the
bosphorus
near
the
black
sea
one
charming
morning
we
ascended
the
strait
in
a
steamboat
that
calls
at
the
landings
on
the
eastern
shore
the
bosphorus
if
you
will
have
it
in
a
phrase
is
a
river
of
lapis
lazuli
lined
with
marble
palaces
as
we
saw
it
that
morning
its
sloping
gardens
terraces
trees
and
vines
in
the
tender
bloom
of
spring
all
the
extravagance
of
the
oriental
poets
in
praise
of
it
was
justified
and
it
was
easy
to
believe
the
with
which
the
earliest
adventurers
had
clothed
it
there
at
beshiktash
jason
landed
to
rest
his
weary
sailors
on
the
voyage
to
colchis
and
above
there
at
koroo
ghesmeh
stood
a
which
medea
planted
on
the
return
of
the
argonauts
tradition
has
placed
near
it
on
the
point
the
site
of
a
less
attractive
object
the
pillar
upon
which
simeon
stylites
spent
forty
years
of
a
life
which
was
just
forty
years
too
long
but
i
do
not
know
by
what
authority
for
i
believe
that
the
perch
of
the
syrian
hermit
was
near
antioch
where
his
noble
position
edified
thousands
of
christians
who
enjoyed
their
piety
in
contemplating
his
and
took
their
pleasures
in
the
groves
of
daphne
our
steamer
was
at
this
moment
a
craft
more
dangerous
to
mankind
than
an
it
was
a
sort
of
floating
harem
we
sat
upon
the
upper
deck
the
greater
part
of
the
lower
deck
was
jealously
curtained
off
and
filled
with
turkish
ladies
among
them
we
recognized
a
little
flock
of
a
couple
of
dozen
the
harem
of
mustapha
pasha
the
uncle
of
the
khedive
of
egypt
they
left
the
boat
at
his
palace
in
chenguel
keuy
and
we
saw
them
in
silk
gowns
of
white
red
blue
and
yellow
streaming
across
the
into
the
marble
portal
pretty
picture
the
pasha
was
transferring
his
household
to
the
country
for
the
summer
and
we
imagined
that
the
imprisoned
troop
entered
these
blooming
may
gardens
with
the
elation
of
freedom
which
might
however
be
more
perfect
if
eunuchs
did
not
watch
every
gate
and
foot
of
the
garden
wall
i
suppose
however
that
few
of
them
would
be
willing
to
exchange
their
lives
of
idle
luxury
for
the
misery
and
chance
of
their
former
condition
and
it
is
said
that
the
maids
of
the
christian
georgia
hear
with
envy
of
the
good
fortune
of
their
sisters
who
have
brought
good
prices
in
the
turkish
capital
when
the
harem
disappeared
we
found
some
consolation
in
a
tall
croat
who
strutted
up
and
down
the
deck
in
front
of
us
that
we
might
sicken
with
envy
of
his
splendid
costume
he
wore
tight
trousers
of
blue
cloth
baggy
in
the
rear
but
fitting
the
legs
like
a
glove
and
terminating
over
the
shoes
in
a
quilled
inverted
funnel
a
brilliant
scarf
of
syrian
silk
in
loose
folds
about
his
loins
a
vest
stiff
with
broidery
a
scarlet
jacket
decked
with
and
on
his
head
a
red
fez
this
is
the
costly
dress
of
a
croatian
gardener
who
displays
all
his
wealth
to
make
a
holiday
spectacle
of
himself
we
sailed
close
to
the
village
of
kandili
and
the
promontory
under
which
and
upon
which
it
lies
a
site
which
exhausts
the
capacity
of
the
loveliness
of
nature
and
the
skill
of
art
from
the
villas
on
its
height
one
commands
by
a
shifted
glance
the
euxine
and
the
marmora
and
whatever
is
most
lovely
in
the
prospect
of
two
continents
the
purity
of
the
air
is
said
to
equal
the
charm
of
the
view
above
this
promontory
opens
the
valley
down
which
flows
the
river
geuksoo
and
at
the
north
of
it
stands
a
white
marble
kiosk
of
the
sultan
the
most
beautiful
architectural
creation
on
the
strait
near
it
shaded
by
great
trees
is
a
handsome
fountain
beyond
the
green
turf
in
the
vale
which
pierces
the
hill
were
groups
of
in
gay
attire
i
do
not
know
if
this
valley
of
the
heavenly
water
is
the
loveliest
in
the
east
but
it
is
said
that
its
charms
of
meadow
shade
sweet
water
and
scented
flowers
are
a
substantial
foretaste
of
the
paradise
of
the
true
believer
but
it
is
in
vain
to
catalogue
the
charming
villages
the
fresh
beauties
of
nature
and
art
to
which
each
revolution
of
the
carried
us
we
thought
we
should
be
content
with
a
summer
residence
of
the
khedive
on
the
european
side
below
the
lovely
bay
of
terapea
with
its
vast
hillside
of
gardens
and
orchards
and
the
long
line
of
palaces
on
the
water
fanned
by
the
invigorating
breezes
from
the
black
sea
its
summer
climate
must
be
perfect
we
landed
at
beicos
and
in
default
of
any
conveyance
walked
up
through
the
straggling
village
along
the
shore
to
a
verdant
shady
meadow
sweet
with
clover
and
this
is
in
the
valley
of
iskelesi
a
favorite
residence
of
the
sultans
here
on
a
projecting
rocky
point
is
a
reddish
palace
built
and
given
to
the
sultan
by
the
khedive
the
meadow
in
which
we
were
is
behind
a
palace
of
old
mohammed
ali
and
it
is
now
used
as
a
pasture
for
the
sultan
horses
dozens
of
which
were
tethered
and
feeding
in
the
lush
grass
and
clover
the
tents
of
their
attendants
were
pitched
on
the
plain
and
groups
of
turkish
ladies
were
picnicking
under
the
large
sycamores
it
was
a
charming
rural
scene
i
made
the
silent
acquaintance
of
an
old
man
in
a
white
turban
and
flowing
robes
who
sat
in
the
grass
knitting
and
watching
his
one
white
lamb
feed
probably
knitting
the
fleece
of
his
lamb
of
the
year
before
we
were
in
search
of
an
araba
and
team
to
take
us
up
the
mountain
one
stood
in
the
meadow
which
we
could
hire
but
oxen
were
wanting
and
we
despatched
a
greek
boy
in
search
of
the
animals
the
turkish
ladies
of
fashion
delight
in
the
araba
when
they
ride
into
the
country
greatly
preferring
it
to
the
horse
or
donkey
or
to
any
other
carriage
it
is
a
long
cart
of
four
wheels
without
springs
but
it
is
as
stately
in
appearance
as
the
of
a
circus
its
sloping
and
even
the
platform
in
front
are
elaborately
carved
and
gilded
while
we
waited
the
motions
of
the
boy
who
joined
to
himself
two
others
even
more
prone
to
go
astray
than
himself
an
officer
of
the
royal
stables
invited
us
to
take
seats
under
the
shade
of
his
tent
and
served
us
with
coffee
after
an
hour
the
boy
returned
with
two
lean
steers
the
rude
hooped
top
of
the
araba
was
spread
with
a
purple
cloth
a
thick
bedquilt
covered
the
bottom
and
by
the
aid
of
a
ladder
we
climbed
into
the
ark
and
sat
or
lay
as
we
could
best
stow
ourselves
a
boy
led
the
steers
by
a
rope
another
walked
at
the
side
gently
goading
them
with
a
stick
and
we
rumbled
along
slowly
through
the
brilliant
meadows
it
became
evident
after
a
time
that
we
were
not
ascending
the
mountain
but
going
into
the
heart
of
the
country
the
cart
was
stopped
and
the
wild
driver
was
interrogated
i
never
saw
a
human
being
so
totally
devoid
of
a
conscience
we
had
hired
him
to
take
us
up
to
giant
grave
mountain
he
was
deliberately
cheating
us
out
of
it
at
first
he
insisted
that
he
was
going
in
the
right
direction
but
upon
the
application
of
the
dragoman
fingers
to
his
ear
he
pleaded
that
the
mountain
road
was
bad
and
that
it
was
just
as
well
for
us
to
visit
the
sultan
farm
up
the
valley
we
had
come
seven
thousand
miles
to
see
the
view
from
the
mountain
but
this
boy
had
not
the
least
scruple
in
depriving
us
of
it
we
turned
about
and
entered
a
charming
glen
thoroughly
new
england
in
its
character
set
with
small
trees
and
shrubs
and
carpeted
with
a
turf
of
short
sweet
grass
one
needs
to
be
some
months
in
the
orient
to
appreciate
the
delight
experienced
by
the
sight
of
genuine
turf
as
we
ascended
the
road
gullied
by
the
spring
torrents
at
last
became
impassable
for
wheels
and
we
were
obliged
to
abandon
the
araba
and
perform
the
last
of
the
journey
on
foot
the
sightly
summit
of
the
mountain
is
nearly
six
hundred
feet
above
the
water
there
in
a
lovely
grove
we
found
a
coffeehouse
and
a
mosque
and
the
giant
grave
which
the
moslems
call
the
grave
of
joshua
it
is
a
enclosure
seventy
feet
long
and
seven
wide
ample
for
any
hero
the
railing
about
it
is
tagged
with
bits
of
cloth
which
pious
devotees
have
tied
there
in
the
expectation
that
their
diseases
perhaps
their
sins
will
vanish
with
the
airing
of
these
shreds
from
the
minaret
is
a
wonderful
view
entire
length
of
the
bosphorus
with
all
its
windings
and
lovely
bays
enlivened
with
white
sails
ships
at
anchor
and
darting
steamers
rich
in
villages
ancient
castles
and
forts
a
great
portion
of
asia
minor
with
the
snow
peaks
of
olympus
on
the
south
the
islands
of
the
blest
and
the
sea
of
marmora
on
the
north
the
cyanean
rocks
and
the
wide
sweep
of
the
euxine
blue
as
heaven
and
dotted
with
a
hundred
white
sails
overlooked
by
the
ruin
of
a
genoese
castle
at
the
entrance
of
the
bosphorus
built
on
the
site
of
a
temple
of
jupiter
and
the
spot
where
the
argonauts
halted
before
they
ventured
among
the
symplegades
and
immediately
below
terapea
and
the
deep
bay
of
buyukdereh
the
summer
resort
of
the
foreign
residents
of
constantinople
a
paradise
of
palaces
and
gardens
of
vales
and
stately
and
the
entrance
to
the
interior
village
of
belgrade
with
its
sacred
forest
unprofaned
as
yet
by
the
axe
the
cyanean
rocks
which
jason
and
his
mariners
regarded
as
floating
islands
or
sentient
monsters
vanishing
and
reappearing
are
harmlessly
anchored
now
and
do
not
appear
at
all
formidable
though
they
disappear
now
as
of
old
when
the
fierce
euxine
rolls
in
its
storm
waves
por
a
long
time
and
with
insatiable
curiosity
we
followed
with
the
eye
the
line
of
the
coast
of
the
pontus
euxinus
once
as
thickly
set
with
towns
as
the
riviera
of
italy
of
ionian
dorian
and
athenian
colonies
who
followed
the
phoenicians
and
perhaps
the
egyptians
the
vain
hope
of
extending
our
vision
to
trebizond
to
the
sea
fortress
of
petra
renowned
for
its
defence
by
the
soldiers
of
chosroes
against
the
arms
of
justinian
and
further
to
the
banks
of
the
pliasis
to
colchis
whose
fabulous
wealth
tempted
jason
and
his
the
waters
of
this
land
were
so
impregnated
with
particles
of
gold
that
fleeces
of
sheep
were
used
to
strain
out
the
yellow
metal
its
palaces
shone
with
gold
and
silver
and
you
might
expect
in
its
gardens
the
fruit
of
the
hesperides
in
the
vales
of
the
caucasus
we
are
taught
our
race
has
attained
its
most
perfect
form
in
other
days
its
men
were
as
renowned
for
strength
and
valor
as
its
women
were
for
beauty
one
could
not
be
permanently
subdued
the
others
conquered
even
in
their
slavery
early
converts
to
the
christian
faith
they
never
adopted
its
morals
nor
comprehended
its
metaphysics
and
perhaps
a
more
dissolute
and
venal
society
does
not
exist
than
that
whose
business
for
centuries
has
been
the
raising
of
maids
for
the
turkish
harems
and
the
miserable
though
willing
victims
are
said
to
possess
not
even
beauty
until
after
a
training
in
luxury
by
the
we
made
our
way
not
without
difficulty
down
the
rough
hillside
invaded
a
new
turkish
fortification
and
at
length
found
a
place
where
we
could
descend
the
precipitous
bank
and
summon
a
boat
to
ferry
us
across
to
buyukdereh
this
was
not
easy
to
obtain
but
finally
an
aged
greek
boatman
appeared
with
a
caique
as
aged
and
decayed
as
himself
the
chances
seemed
to
be
that
it
could
make
the
voyage
and
we
all
packed
ourselves
into
it
sitting
on
the
bottom
and
filling
it
completely
there
was
little
margin
of
boat
above
the
water
and
any
sudden
motion
would
have
reduced
that
to
nothing
we
looked
wise
and
sat
still
while
the
old
greek
pulled
feebly
and
praised
the
excellence
of
his
craft
on
the
opposite
slope
our
attention
was
called
to
a
pretty
cottage
and
a
constantinople
lady
who
was
of
the
party
began
to
tell
us
the
story
of
its
occupant
so
dramatic
and
exciting
did
it
become
that
we
forgot
entirely
the
peril
of
our
frail
and
overloaded
boat
the
story
finished
as
we
drew
up
to
the
landing
which
we
instantly
comprehended
we
had
not
reached
a
moment
too
soon
eor
when
we
arose
our
clothes
were
soaked
we
were
sitting
in
water
which
was
rapidly
filling
the
boat
and
would
have
swamped
it
in
five
minutes
the
of
buyukdereh
the
bay
the
hills
and
villas
reminded
us
of
lake
como
and
the
quay
and
streets
were
rather
italian
than
oriental
the
most
soaked
of
the
voyagers
stood
outside
the
railing
of
the
pretty
garden
of
the
café
to
dry
in
the
sun
while
the
others
sat
inside
under
the
vines
and
passed
out
to
the
unfortunates
through
the
iron
bars
tiny
cups
of
coffee
and
fed
them
with
and
other
delicious
sweetmeats
until
the
arrival
of
the
steamer
the
ride
down
was
lovely
the
sun
made
the
barracks
and
palaces
on
the
east
shore
a
blaze
of
diamonds
and
the
minarets
seen
through
the
steamer
smoke
which
transfused
with
the
rosy
light
overhung
the
city
had
a
phantasmagorical
aspect
constantinople
shares
with
many
other
cities
the
reputation
of
being
the
most
dissolute
in
the
world
the
traveller
is
not
required
to
decide
the
rival
claims
of
this
sort
of
which
are
eagerly
put
forward
he
may
better
in
each
city
acquiesce
in
the
complaisant
assumption
of
the
inhabitants
but
when
he
is
required
to
see
in
the
moral
state
of
the
eastern
capital
signs
of
its
speedy
decay
and
the
near
extinction
of
the
othman
rule
he
takes
a
leaf
out
of
history
and
reflects
it
is
true
no
doubt
that
the
turks
are
enfeebled
by
luxury
and
sensuality
and
have
to
a
great
extent
lost
those
virile
qualities
which
gave
to
their
ancestors
the
dominion
of
so
many
kingdoms
in
asia
africa
and
europe
in
short
that
the
race
is
sinking
into
an
incapacity
to
propagate
itself
in
the
world
if
one
believes
what
he
hears
the
morals
of
society
could
not
be
worse
the
women
so
many
of
whom
have
been
bought
in
the
market
or
are
daughters
of
slaves
are
educated
only
for
pleasure
and
a
great
proportion
of
the
male
population
are
adventurers
from
all
lands
with
few
domestic
ties
the
very
relaxation
of
the
surveillance
of
the
harem
the
necessary
prelude
to
the
emancipation
of
woman
opens
the
door
to
opportunity
and
gives
freer
play
to
feminine
intrigue
one
hears
indeed
that
even
the
inmates
of
the
royal
harem
find
means
of
clandestine
intercourse
with
the
foreigners
of
pera
the
history
of
the
northern
and
western
occupation
of
the
east
has
been
for
fifteen
centuries
only
a
repetition
of
yielding
to
the
seductive
influences
of
a
luxurious
climate
and
to
soft
and
pleasing
invitation
but
heighten
as
we
may
the
true
and
immoral
picture
of
social
life
in
constantinople
i
doubt
if
it
is
so
loose
and
unrestrained
as
it
was
for
centuries
under
the
greek
emperors
i
doubt
if
the
imbecility
the
luxurious
effeminacy
of
the
turks
has
sunk
to
the
level
of
the
byzantine
empire
and
when
we
are
asked
to
expect
in
the
decay
of
a
speedy
dissolution
we
remember
that
for
a
period
of
over
a
thousand
years
from
the
partition
of
the
roman
empire
between
the
two
sons
of
theodosius
to
the
capture
of
constantinople
by
mohammed
the
empire
subsisted
in
a
state
of
premature
and
perpetual
decay
these
oriental
dynasties
are
a
long
time
in
dying
and
we
can
not
measure
their
decrepitude
by
the
standards
of
occidental
morality
the
trade
and
the
commerce
of
the
city
are
largely
in
the
hands
of
foreigners
but
it
has
nearly
always
been
so
since
the
days
of
the
merchants
and
manufacturers
of
pisa
genoa
and
venice
we
might
draw
an
inference
of
turkish
insecurity
from
the
implacable
hatred
of
the
greek
subjects
if
the
latter
were
not
in
the
discord
of
a
thousand
years
of
anarchy
and
servitude
the
history
of
the
islands
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
has
been
a
succession
of
turkish
avarice
and
rapacity
horrible
greek
revenge
and
turkish
wholesale
devastation
and
massacre
repeated
over
and
over
again
but
there
appears
as
yet
no
power
able
either
to
expel
the
turks
or
unite
the
greeks
that
the
leaven
of
change
is
working
in
the
levant
is
evident
to
the
most
superficial
observation
and
one
sees
everywhere
the
introduction
of
western
civilization
of
business
habits
and
above
all
of
schools
however
indifferent
the
osmanlis
are
to
education
they
are
not
insensible
to
european
opinion
and
in
reckoning
up
their
bad
qualities
we
ought
not
to
forget
that
they
have
set
some
portions
of
christendom
a
lesson
of
religious
toleration
in
constantinople
and
jerusalem
the
christians
were
allowed
a
freedom
of
worship
in
their
own
churches
which
was
not
permitted
to
protestants
within
the
sacred
walls
of
pontifical
rome
one
who
would
paint
the
manners
or
the
morals
of
constantinople
might
adorn
his
theme
with
many
anecdotes
characteristic
of
a
condition
of
society
which
is
foreign
to
our
experience
i
select
one
which
has
the
merit
of
being
literally
true
you
who
believe
that
modern
romance
exists
only
in
tales
of
fiction
listen
to
the
story
of
a
beauty
of
constantinople
the
vicissitudes
of
whose
life
equal
in
variety
if
not
in
importance
those
of
theodora
and
athenais
for
obvious
reasons
i
shall
mention
no
names
there
lives
now
on
the
banks
of
the
bosphorus
an
english
physician
who
at
the
entreaty
of
lord
byron
went
to
greece
in
as
a
volunteer
surgeon
in
the
war
of
independence
he
arrived
only
in
time
to
see
the
poet
expire
at
missolonghi
in
the
course
of
the
war
he
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
egyptian
troops
who
in
their
great
need
of
surgeons
kept
him
actively
employed
in
his
profession
he
did
not
regain
his
freedom
until
after
the
war
and
then
only
on
condition
that
he
should
reside
in
constantinople
as
one
of
the
physicians
of
the
sultan
mohammed
ii
we
may
suppose
that
the
oriental
life
was
not
unpleasant
nor
the
position
irksome
to
him
for
he
soon
so
far
yielded
to
the
temptations
of
the
capital
as
to
fall
in
love
with
a
very
pretty
face
which
he
saw
daily
in
a
of
the
street
he
traversed
on
the
way
to
the
seraglio
acquaintance
which
sometimes
precedes
love
in
this
case
followed
it
the
doctor
declared
his
passion
and
was
accepted
by
the
willing
maid
but
an
oriental
is
the
opportunity
of
the
world
and
the
doctor
becoming
convinced
that
his
affianced
was
a
desperate
flirt
and
yielding
to
the
entreaties
of
his
friends
broke
off
the
engagement
and
left
her
free
in
her
eyry
to
continue
her
observations
upon
mankind
this
however
did
not
suit
the
plans
of
the
lovely
and
fickle
girl
one
morning
shortly
after
he
was
summoned
to
see
two
turkish
ladies
who
awaited
him
in
his
office
when
he
appeared
the
young
girl
for
it
was
she
and
her
mother
threw
aside
their
disguise
and
declared
that
they
would
not
leave
the
house
until
the
doctor
married
the
daughter
for
the
rupture
of
the
engagement
had
rendered
it
impossible
to
procure
any
other
husband
whether
her
own
beauty
or
the
terrible
aspect
of
the
mother
prevailed
i
do
not
know
but
the
english
chaplain
was
sent
for
he
refused
to
perform
the
ceremony
and
a
greek
priest
was
found
who
married
them
this
marriage
which
took
the
appearance
of
duress
might
have
been
happy
if
the
compelling
party
to
it
had
left
her
fondness
of
adventure
and
variety
at
the
wedding
threshold
but
her
constancy
was
only
assumed
like
the
turkish
veil
for
an
occasion
lovers
were
not
wanting
and
after
the
birth
of
three
children
two
sons
and
a
daughter
she
deserted
her
husband
and
went
to
live
with
a
young
turk
who
has
since
held
high
office
in
the
government
of
the
sultan
it
was
in
her
character
of
madame
mehemet
pasha
that
she
wrote
or
one
of
her
sons
wrote
for
her
a
book
well
known
in
the
west
entitled
years
in
a
but
her
intriguing
spirit
was
not
extinct
even
in
a
turkish
harem
she
attempted
to
palm
off
upon
the
pasha
as
her
own
a
child
that
she
had
bought
her
device
was
detected
by
one
of
the
palace
eunuchs
and
at
the
same
time
her
amour
with
a
greek
of
the
city
came
to
light
the
eunuch
incurred
her
displeasure
for
his
officiousness
and
she
had
him
strangled
and
thrown
into
the
bosphorus
some
say
that
the
resolute
woman
even
assisted
with
her
own
hands
for
these
breaches
of
decorum
however
she
paid
dear
the
pasha
banished
her
to
kutayah
with
orders
to
the
guard
who
attended
her
to
poison
her
on
the
way
but
she
so
won
upon
the
affection
of
the
officer
that
he
let
her
escape
at
broussa
there
her
beauty
if
not
her
piety
recommended
her
to
an
imam
of
one
of
the
mosques
and
she
married
him
and
seems
for
a
time
to
have
led
a
quiet
life
at
any
rate
nothing
further
was
heard
of
her
until
just
before
the
famous
cholera
season
when
news
came
of
the
death
of
her
husband
the
moslem
priest
and
that
she
was
living
in
extreme
poverty
all
her
beauty
gone
forever
and
consequently
her
ability
to
procure
another
husband
the
pasha
mehemet
lived
in
a
beautiful
palace
on
the
eastern
shore
of
the
bosphorus
near
kandili
during
the
great
cholera
epidemic
of
the
pasha
was
taken
one
day
there
appeared
at
the
gate
an
unknown
woman
who
said
that
she
had
come
to
cure
the
pasha
no
one
knew
her
but
she
spoke
with
authority
and
was
admitted
it
was
our
adventuress
she
nursed
the
pasha
with
the
most
tender
care
and
watchful
skill
so
that
he
recovered
and
in
gratitude
for
the
preservation
of
his
life
he
permitted
her
and
her
daughter
to
remain
in
the
palace
for
some
time
they
were
contented
with
the
luxury
of
such
a
home
but
one
was
the
evening
of
mother
nor
daughter
was
to
be
found
and
upon
examination
it
was
discovered
that
a
large
collection
of
precious
stones
and
some
ready
money
had
disappeared
with
them
they
had
departed
on
the
french
steamer
in
order
to
transfer
their
talents
to
the
fields
of
europe
the
fate
of
the
daughter
i
do
not
know
for
some
time
she
and
her
mother
were
conspicuous
in
the
dissipation
of
paris
life
subsequently
the
mother
lived
with
a
son
in
london
and
since
i
heard
her
story
in
constantinople
she
has
died
in
london
in
misery
and
want
the
further
history
of
the
doctor
and
his
family
may
detain
our
curiosity
for
a
moment
when
his
wife
left
him
for
the
arms
of
the
pasha
he
experienced
so
much
difficulty
in
finding
any
one
in
constantinople
to
take
care
of
his
children
that
he
determined
to
send
them
to
scotland
to
be
educated
and
intrusted
them
for
that
purpose
to
a
friend
who
was
returning
to
england
they
went
by
way
of
rome
it
happened
that
the
mother
and
sister
of
the
doctor
had
some
time
before
that
come
to
rome
for
the
sake
of
health
and
had
there
warmly
embraced
the
roman
catholic
faith
of
course
the
three
children
were
taken
to
see
their
grandmother
and
aunt
and
the
latter
concerned
for
their
eternal
welfare
diverted
them
from
their
journey
and
immured
the
boys
in
a
monastery
and
the
girl
in
a
convent
the
father
when
he
heard
of
this
abduction
expressed
indignation
but
having
at
that
time
only
such
religious
faith
as
may
be
floating
in
the
oriental
air
and
common
to
all
he
made
no
vigorous
effort
to
recover
his
children
indeed
he
consoled
himself
in
the
fashion
of
the
country
by
marrying
again
this
time
a
greek
lady
who
died
leaving
two
boys
the
doctor
was
successful
in
transporting
the
offspring
of
his
second
marriage
to
scotland
where
they
were
educated
and
they
returned
to
do
him
honor
of
them
as
the
eloquent
and
devoted
pastor
of
a
protestant
church
in
pera
and
the
other
as
a
physician
in
the
employment
of
the
government
after
the
death
of
his
second
wife
the
can
but
tell
the
story
as
i
heard
a
changed
man
again
this
time
a
swiss
lady
of
lovely
christian
character
in
his
changed
condition
he
began
to
feel
anxious
to
recover
his
children
from
the
grasp
of
rome
he
wrote
for
information
but
his
sister
refused
to
tell
where
they
were
and
his
search
could
discover
no
trace
of
them
at
length
the
father
obtained
leave
of
absence
from
the
seraglio
and
armed
with
an
autograph
letter
from
abdul
aziz
to
pius
he
went
to
rome
the
pope
gave
him
an
order
for
the
restoration
of
his
children
he
drove
first
to
the
convent
to
see
his
daughter
in
place
of
the
little
girl
whom
he
had
years
ago
parted
with
he
found
a
young
lady
of
extraordinary
beauty
and
a
devoted
romanist
at
first
she
refused
to
go
with
him
and
it
was
only
upon
his
promise
to
allow
her
perfect
liberty
of
conscience
and
never
to
interfere
with
any
of
the
observances
of
her
church
that
she
consented
not
daring
to
lose
sight
of
her
he
waited
for
her
to
pack
her
trunk
and
then
putting
her
into
a
carriage
drove
to
the
monastery
where
he
heard
after
many
inquiries
that
his
boys
were
confined
the
monk
who
admitted
him
denied
that
they
were
there
and
endeavored
to
lock
him
into
the
while
he
went
to
call
the
superior
but
the
doctor
anticipated
his
movements
and
as
soon
as
the
monk
was
out
of
sight
started
to
explore
the
house
by
good
luck
the
first
door
he
opened
led
into
a
chamber
where
a
sick
boy
was
lying
on
a
bed
the
doctor
believed
that
he
recognized
one
of
his
sons
a
few
questions
satisfied
him
that
he
was
right
am
your
father
he
said
to
the
astonished
lad
quickly
and
call
your
brother
and
come
with
monastic
discipline
had
not
so
many
attractions
for
the
boys
as
convent
life
for
the
girl
and
the
child
ran
with
alacrity
and
brought
his
brother
just
as
the
abbot
and
a
score
of
monks
appeared
upon
the
scene
as
the
celerity
of
the
doctor
had
given
no
opportunity
to
conceal
the
boys
opposition
to
the
order
of
the
pope
was
useless
and
the
father
hastened
to
the
gate
where
he
had
left
the
carriage
meantime
the
aunt
had
heard
of
the
rescue
and
followed
the
girl
from
the
convent
she
implored
her
by
tears
and
prayers
to
reverse
her
decision
the
doctor
cut
short
the
scene
by
shoving
his
sons
into
the
carriage
and
driving
rapidly
away
nor
did
he
trust
them
long
in
rome
the
subsequent
career
of
the
boys
is
not
dwelt
on
with
pleasure
one
of
them
enlisted
in
the
turkish
army
married
a
turkish
wife
and
after
some
years
deserted
her
and
ran
away
to
england
his
wife
was
taken
into
a
pasha
family
who
offered
to
adopt
her
only
child
a
boy
of
four
years
but
the
mother
preferred
to
bring
him
to
his
grandfather
none
of
the
family
had
seen
her
but
she
established
her
identity
and
begged
that
her
child
might
be
adopted
by
a
good
man
which
she
knew
his
grandfather
to
be
and
receive
a
christian
training
the
doctor
therefore
adopted
the
grandchild
which
had
come
to
him
in
such
a
strange
way
and
the
mother
shortly
after
died
the
daughter
whose
acquired
accomplishments
matched
her
inherited
beauty
married
in
time
a
venetian
count
of
wealth
and
the
idler
in
venice
may
see
on
the
grand
canal
among
those
mouldy
edifices
that
could
reveal
so
many
romances
their
sumptuous
palace
and
learn
if
he
cares
to
learn
that
it
is
the
home
of
a
family
happy
in
the
enjoyment
of
most
felicitous
fortune
in
the
gossip
with
which
the
best
italian
society
sometimes
amuses
itself
he
might
hear
that
the
countess
was
the
daughter
of
a
slave
of
the
sultan
harem
i
have
given
however
the
true
version
of
the
romantic
story
but
i
am
ignorant
of
the
social
condition
or
the
race
of
the
mother
of
the
heroine
of
so
many
adventures
she
may
have
been
born
in
the
caucasus
the
golden
horn
to
the
acropolis
our
last
day
in
constantinople
was
a
bright
invitation
for
us
to
remain
forever
we
could
have
departed
without
regret
in
a
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
resolve
to
look
our
last
upon
this
shining
city
and
marvellous
landscape
under
the
blue
sky
of
may
early
in
the
morning
we
climbed
up
the
genoese
tower
in
galata
and
saw
the
hundred
crescents
of
stamboul
sparkle
in
the
sun
the
golden
horn
and
the
bosphorus
shifting
panoramas
of
trade
and
pleasure
the
propontis
with
its
purple
islands
and
the
azure
and
snowy
mountains
of
asia
this
massive
tower
is
now
a
station
and
night
and
day
watchmen
look
out
from
its
battlemented
gallery
the
seraskier
tower
opposite
in
stamboul
and
another
on
the
heights
of
the
asiatic
shore
keep
the
same
watch
over
the
inflammable
city
the
guard
requested
us
not
to
open
our
parasols
upon
the
gallery
for
fear
they
would
be
hailed
as
the
day
was
spent
in
last
visits
to
the
bazaars
in
packing
and
and
the
passage
of
the
for
the
government
encourages
trade
by
an
export
as
well
as
an
import
duty
i
did
not
see
any
of
the
officials
but
who
had
charge
of
shipping
our
baggage
reported
that
the
eyes
of
the
customs
inspector
were
each
just
the
size
of
a
piece
chief
among
our
regrets
at
setting
our
faces
toward
europe
was
the
necessity
of
parting
with
and
ahmed
the
former
had
been
our
faithful
dragoman
and
daily
companion
for
five
months
and
we
had
not
yet
exhausted
his
adventures
nor
his
stores
of
oriental
humor
and
we
could
not
expect
to
find
elsewhere
a
character
like
ahmed
a
person
so
shrewd
and
obliging
and
of
such
amusing
vivacity
at
four
we
embarked
upon
an
italian
steamer
for
salonica
and
athens
a
four
days
voyage
at
the
last
moment
would
have
gone
with
us
upon
the
least
encouragement
but
we
had
no
further
need
of
dragoman
or
interpreter
and
the
old
man
sadly
descended
the
ladder
to
his
boat
i
can
see
him
yet
his
red
fez
in
the
stern
of
the
caique
waving
his
large
silk
handkerchief
and
slowly
rowing
back
to
pera
melancholy
figure
as
we
steamed
out
of
the
harbor
we
enjoyed
the
view
we
had
missed
on
entering
the
seraglio
point
where
blind
old
dandolo
ran
his
galley
aground
and
leaped
on
shore
to
the
assault
the
shore
of
chalcedon
the
seven
towers
and
the
old
wall
behind
stamboul
which
persians
arabs
scythians
and
latins
have
stormed
the
long
sweeping
coast
and
its
minarets
the
princes
islands
and
mt
olympus
this
in
a
setting
sun
was
superb
and
we
said
is
not
its
equal
in
the
and
the
evening
was
more
magnificent
moon
nearly
full
a
sweet
and
rosy
light
on
the
smooth
water
which
was
at
first
azure
blue
and
then
pearly
gray
and
glowing
like
an
amethyst
smoothly
sailing
all
night
we
came
at
sunrise
to
the
entrance
of
the
dardanelles
and
stopped
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
chanak
kalessi
before
the
guns
of
the
castle
of
asia
the
traders
immediately
swarmed
on
board
with
their
barbarous
pottery
and
with
trays
of
cooked
fish
onions
and
bread
for
the
deck
passengers
the
latter
were
mostly
greeks
and
men
in
the
costume
which
one
sees
still
in
the
islands
and
the
asiatic
coasts
but
very
seldom
on
the
grecian
mainland
it
consists
of
baggy
trousers
close
at
the
ankles
a
shawl
about
the
waist
an
embroidered
jacket
usually
of
sober
color
and
the
most
prized
part
of
their
possessions
an
arsenal
of
pistols
and
knives
in
huge
leathern
holsters
with
a
heavy
leathern
flap
worn
in
front
most
of
them
wore
a
small
red
fez
the
hair
cut
close
in
front
and
falling
long
behind
the
ears
they
are
light
in
complexion
not
tall
rather
stout
and
without
beauty
though
their
dress
is
picturesque
in
plan
it
is
usually
very
dirty
ragged
and
the
last
confession
of
poverty
patched
they
were
all
armed
like
pirates
and
when
we
stopped
a
cracking
fusillade
along
the
deck
suggested
a
mutiny
but
it
was
only
a
precautionary
measure
of
the
captain
who
compelled
them
to
discharge
their
pistols
into
the
water
and
then
took
them
from
them
passing
out
of
the
strait
we
saw
the
rabbit
islands
and
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
plain
of
troy
about
as
misty
as
its
mythic
history
and
then
turned
west
between
imbros
and
lemnos
on
whose
bold
eastern
rock
once
blazed
one
of
the
which
telegraphed
the
fall
of
troy
to
clytemnestra
the
first
women
of
lemnos
were
altogether
beautiful
but
they
had
some
peculiarities
which
did
not
recommend
them
to
their
contemporaries
and
indeed
their
husbands
were
accustomed
occasionally
to
hoist
sail
and
bask
in
the
smiles
of
the
damsels
of
the
thracian
coast
the
lemnian
women
to
avoid
any
legal
difficulties
such
as
arise
nowadays
when
a
woman
asserts
her
right
to
slay
her
partner
killed
all
their
husbands
and
set
up
an
amazonian
state
which
they
maintained
with
pride
and
splendor
permitting
no
man
to
set
foot
on
the
island
in
time
this
absolute
freedom
became
a
little
tedious
and
when
the
argonauts
came
that
way
the
women
advanced
to
meet
the
heroes
with
garlands
and
brought
them
wine
and
food
this
conduct
pleased
the
argonauts
who
made
lemnos
their
headquarters
and
celebrated
there
many
a
festive
combat
their
descendants
the
minyæ
were
afterwards
overcome
by
the
pelasgians
from
attica
who
remembering
with
regret
the
beautiful
girls
of
their
home
returned
and
brought
back
with
them
the
willing
and
the
lovely
but
the
children
of
the
attic
women
took
on
airs
over
their
superior
birth
which
the
pelasgian
women
resented
and
the
latter
finally
removed
all
cause
of
dispute
by
murdering
all
the
mothers
of
attica
and
their
offspring
these
events
gave
the
ladies
of
lemnos
a
formidable
reputation
in
the
ancient
world
and
furnish
an
illustration
of
what
society
would
be
without
the
refining
and
temperate
influence
of
man
to
the
northward
lifted
itself
the
bare
back
of
samothrace
and
beyond
the
dim
outline
of
thasos
ancient
the
home
of
the
poet
archilochus
one
of
the
few
grecian
islands
which
still
retains
something
of
its
pristine
luxuriance
of
vegetation
where
the
songs
of
innumerable
nightingales
invite
to
its
deep
flowery
valleys
beyond
thasos
is
the
thracian
coast
and
mt
pangaus
and
at
the
foot
of
it
philippi
the
macedonian
town
where
republican
rome
fought
its
last
battle
where
cassius
leaned
upon
his
believing
everything
lost
brutus
transported
the
body
of
his
comrade
to
thasos
and
raised
for
him
a
funeral
pyre
and
twenty
days
later
on
the
same
field
met
again
that
spectre
of
death
which
had
summoned
him
to
philippi
it
was
only
eleven
years
after
this
victory
of
the
imperial
power
that
a
greater
triumph
was
won
at
philippi
when
paul
and
silas
cast
into
prison
sang
praises
unto
god
at
midnight
and
an
earthquake
shook
the
house
and
opened
the
prison
doors
in
the
afternoon
we
came
in
sight
of
snowy
mt
athos
an
almost
perpendicular
limestone
rock
rising
nearly
six
thousand
four
hundred
feet
out
of
the
sea
the
slender
promontory
which
this
magnificent
mountain
terminates
is
forty
miles
long
and
has
only
an
average
breadth
of
four
miles
the
ancient
canal
of
xerxes
quite
severed
it
from
the
mainland
the
peninsula
level
at
the
canal
is
a
jagged
stretch
of
mountains
seamed
by
chasms
which
rise
a
thousand
two
thousand
four
thousand
feet
and
at
last
front
the
sea
with
the
sublime
peak
of
athos
the
site
of
the
most
conspicuous
of
agamemnon
the
entire
promontory
is
and
has
been
since
the
time
of
constantine
ecclesiastic
ground
every
mountain
and
valley
has
its
convent
besides
the
twenty
great
monasteries
are
many
pious
retreats
all
the
sects
of
the
greek
church
are
here
represented
the
communities
pay
a
tribute
to
the
sultan
but
the
government
is
in
the
hands
of
four
presidents
chosen
by
the
synod
which
holds
weekly
sessions
and
takes
the
presidents
yearly
from
the
monasteries
in
rotation
since
their
foundation
these
religious
houses
have
maintained
against
christians
and
saracens
an
almost
complete
independence
and
preserved
in
their
primitive
simplicity
the
manners
and
usages
of
the
earliest
foundations
here
as
nowhere
else
in
europe
or
asia
can
one
behold
the
architecture
the
dress
the
habits
of
the
middle
ages
the
good
devotees
have
been
able
to
keep
themselves
thus
in
the
darkness
and
simplicity
of
the
past
by
a
rigorous
exclusion
of
the
sex
always
impatient
of
monotony
to
which
all
the
changes
of
the
world
are
due
no
woman
from
the
beginning
till
now
has
ever
been
permitted
to
set
foot
on
the
peninsula
nor
is
this
all
no
female
animal
is
suffered
on
the
holy
mountain
not
even
a
hen
i
suppose
though
i
do
not
know
that
the
monks
have
an
inspector
of
eggs
whose
inherited
instincts
of
aversion
to
the
feminine
gender
enable
him
to
detect
and
reject
all
those
in
which
lurk
the
dangerous
sex
few
of
the
monks
eat
meat
half
the
days
of
the
year
are
fast
days
they
practise
occasionally
abstinence
from
food
for
two
or
three
days
reducing
their
pulses
to
the
feeblest
beating
and
subduing
their
bodies
to
a
point
that
destroys
their
value
even
as
spiritual
tabernacles
the
united
community
is
permitted
to
keep
a
guard
of
fifty
christian
soldiers
and
the
only
moslem
on
the
island
is
the
solitary
turkish
officer
who
represents
the
sultan
his
position
can
not
be
one
generally
coveted
by
the
turks
since
the
society
of
women
is
absolutely
denied
him
the
libraries
of
mt
athos
are
full
of
unarranged
manuscripts
which
are
probably
mainly
filled
with
the
theologic
rubbish
of
the
controversial
ages
and
can
scarcely
be
expected
to
yield
again
anything
so
valuable
as
the
tischendorf
scriptures
at
sunset
we
were
close
under
mt
athos
and
could
distinguish
the
buildings
of
the
laura
convent
amid
the
woods
beneath
the
frowning
cliff
and
now
was
produced
the
apparition
of
a
sunset
with
this
towering
mountain
cone
for
a
that
surpassed
all
our
experience
and
imagination
the
sea
was
like
satin
for
smoothness
absolutely
waveless
and
shone
with
the
colors
of
changeable
silk
blue
green
pink
and
amethyst
heavy
clouds
gathered
about
the
sun
and
from
behind
them
he
exhibited
burning
spectacles
magnificent
fireworks
vast
scarlet
cities
and
gigantic
figures
stalking
across
the
sky
from
one
crater
of
embers
he
shot
up
a
flame
that
spread
to
the
zenith
and
was
reflected
on
the
water
his
rays
lay
along
the
sea
in
pink
and
the
water
had
the
sheen
of
iridescent
glass
the
whole
sea
for
leagues
was
like
this
even
lemnos
and
samothrace
lay
in
a
dim
pink
and
purple
light
in
the
east
there
were
vast
clouds
in
huge
walls
with
towers
and
battlements
and
in
all
fantastic
shapes
a
gigantic
cat
with
a
preternatural
tail
a
cat
of
doom
four
degrees
long
all
this
was
piled
about
mt
athos
with
its
sharp
summit
of
snow
its
dark
sides
of
rock
it
is
a
pity
that
the
sounding
and
somewhat
sacred
name
of
thessalonica
has
been
abbreviated
to
salonica
it
might
better
have
reverted
to
its
ancient
name
of
therma
which
distinguished
the
macedonian
capital
up
to
the
time
of
alexander
in
the
early
morning
we
were
lying
before
the
city
and
were
told
that
we
should
stay
till
midnight
waiting
for
the
mail
from
whence
a
mail
was
expected
i
do
not
know
the
traveller
who
sails
these
seas
with
a
cargo
of
ancient
history
resents
in
these
classic
localities
such
attempts
to
imitate
modern
fashions
were
the
dardanians
or
the
mesians
to
send
us
letters
in
a
leathern
bag
we
were
prepared
for
a
summons
from
at
the
head
of
his
wild
barbarians
to
surrender
the
city
and
we
should
have
liked
to
see
boniface
marquis
of
montferrat
and
king
of
thessalonica
issue
from
the
fortress
above
the
town
the
shields
and
lances
of
his
little
band
of
knights
shining
in
the
sun
and
answer
in
person
the
insolent
demand
we
were
prepared
to
see
the
troop
return
having
left
the
head
of
boniface
in
the
possession
of
and
if
our
captain
had
told
us
that
the
steamer
would
wait
to
attend
the
funeral
of
the
bulgarian
chief
himself
which
occurred
not
long
after
the
encounter
with
boniface
we
should
have
thought
it
natural
the
city
lies
on
a
fine
bay
and
presents
an
attractive
appearance
from
the
harbor
rising
up
the
hill
in
the
form
of
an
amphitheatre
on
all
sides
except
the
sea
ancient
walls
surround
it
fortified
at
the
angles
by
large
round
towers
and
crowned
in
the
centre
on
the
hill
by
a
respectable
citadel
i
suppose
that
portions
of
these
walls
are
of
hellenic
and
perhaps
pelasgic
date
but
the
most
are
probably
of
the
time
of
the
latin
crusaders
occupation
patched
and
repaired
by
saracens
and
turks
we
had
come
to
thessalonica
on
account
not
expecting
to
see
much
that
would
excite
us
and
we
were
not
disappointed
when
we
went
ashore
we
found
ourselves
in
a
city
of
perhaps
sixty
thousand
inhabitants
commonplace
in
aspect
although
its
bazaars
are
well
filled
with
european
goods
and
a
fair
display
of
oriental
stuffs
and
antiquities
and
animated
by
considerable
briskness
of
trade
i
presume
there
are
more
jews
here
than
there
were
in
time
but
turks
and
greeks
in
nearly
equal
numbers
form
the
bulk
of
the
population
in
modern
salonica
there
is
not
much
respect
for
pagan
antiquities
and
one
sees
only
the
usual
fragments
of
columns
and
sculptures
worked
into
walls
or
incorporated
in
christian
churches
but
those
curious
in
early
byzantine
architecture
will
find
more
to
interest
them
here
than
in
any
place
in
the
world
except
constantinople
we
spent
the
day
wandering
about
the
city
under
the
guidance
of
a
young
jew
who
was
without
either
prejudices
or
information
on
our
way
to
the
mosque
of
sophia
we
passed
through
the
quarter
of
the
jews
which
is
much
cleaner
than
is
usual
with
them
these
are
the
descendants
of
spanish
jews
who
were
expelled
by
isabella
and
they
still
retain
in
a
corrupt
form
the
language
of
spain
in
the
doors
and
windows
were
many
pretty
jewesses
banishment
and
vicissitude
appear
to
agree
with
this
elastic
race
for
in
all
the
countries
of
europe
jewish
women
develop
more
beauty
in
form
and
feature
than
in
palestine
we
saw
here
and
in
other
parts
of
the
city
a
novel
which
may
commend
itself
to
america
in
the
revolutions
of
fashion
a
great
mass
of
hair
real
or
assumed
was
gathered
into
a
long
slender
green
bag
which
hung
down
the
back
and
was
terminated
by
a
heavy
fringe
of
silver
otherwise
the
dress
of
the
jewish
women
does
not
differ
much
from
that
of
the
men
the
latter
wear
a
fez
or
turban
and
a
tunic
which
reaches
to
the
ankles
and
is
bound
about
the
waist
by
a
gay
sash
or
shawl
the
mosque
of
sophia
once
a
church
and
copied
in
its
proportions
and
style
from
its
namesake
in
constantinople
is
retired
in
a
delightful
court
shaded
by
gigantic
trees
and
cheered
by
a
fountain
so
peaceful
a
spot
we
had
not
seen
in
many
a
day
birds
sang
in
the
trees
without
disturbing
the
calm
of
the
meditative
pilgrim
in
the
portico
and
also
in
the
interior
are
noble
columns
of
marble
and
and
in
the
dome
is
a
wonderfully
quaint
mosaic
of
the
transfiguration
we
were
shown
also
a
magnificent
pulpit
of
the
latter
beautiful
stone
cut
from
a
solid
block
in
which
it
is
said
paul
preached
as
the
apostle
according
to
his
custom
reasoned
with
the
people
out
of
the
scriptures
in
a
synagogue
and
this
church
was
not
built
for
centuries
after
his
visit
the
statement
needs
confirmation
but
pious
ingenuity
suggests
that
the
pulpit
stood
in
a
subterranean
church
underneath
this
i
should
like
to
believe
that
paul
sanctified
this
very
spot
with
his
presence
but
there
is
little
in
its
quiet
seclusion
to
remind
one
of
him
who
had
the
reputation
when
he
was
in
thessalonica
of
one
of
those
who
turn
the
world
upside
down
paul
had
a
great
affection
for
the
brethren
of
this
city
in
spite
of
his
rough
usage
here
for
he
mingles
few
reproaches
in
his
fervent
commendations
of
their
faith
and
comforts
them
with
the
assurance
of
a
speedy
release
from
the
troubles
of
this
world
and
the
certainty
that
while
they
are
yet
alive
they
will
be
caught
up
into
the
clouds
to
meet
the
lord
in
the
air
happily
the
apostle
could
not
pierce
the
future
and
see
the
dissensions
the
schisms
the
corruptions
and
calamities
of
the
church
in
the
succeeding
centuries
nor
know
that
near
this
spot
in
the
imperial
hippodrome
the
sedition
of
the
citizens
would
one
day
be
punished
by
the
massacre
of
ninety
thousand
of
the
few
acts
of
inhumanity
which
stains
the
clemency
and
the
great
name
of
theodosius
and
it
would
have
passed
even
the
belief
of
the
apostle
to
the
gentiles
could
he
have
foreseen
that
in
eighteen
centuries
this
pulpit
would
be
exhibited
to
curious
strangers
from
a
distant
part
of
the
globe
of
which
he
never
heard
where
the
doctrines
of
paul
are
the
bulwark
of
the
church
and
the
stamina
of
the
government
by
a
descendant
of
abraham
who
confessed
that
he
did
not
know
who
paul
was
the
oldest
church
in
the
city
is
now
the
mosque
of
george
built
about
the
year
if
indeed
it
was
not
transformed
from
a
heathen
temple
its
form
is
that
of
the
roman
pantheon
the
dome
was
once
covered
with
splendid
mosaics
enough
remains
of
the
architectural
designs
the
brilliant
peacocks
and
bright
blue
birds
to
show
what
the
ancient
beauty
was
but
the
walls
of
the
mosque
are
white
and
religions
inherit
each
other
edifices
in
the
east
without
shame
and
we
found
in
the
mosque
of
eske
djuma
the
remains
of
a
temple
of
venus
and
columns
of
ancient
grecian
work
worthy
of
the
best
days
of
athens
the
most
perfect
basilica
is
now
the
mosque
of
demetrius
a
name
sacred
to
the
greeks
which
contains
his
tomb
it
is
a
basilica
about
the
gallery
over
the
pillars
of
the
centre
aisle
are
some
fine
mosaics
of
marble
beautiful
in
design
and
color
the
moslems
have
spoiled
the
exquisite
capitals
of
the
pillars
by
painting
them
and
have
destroyed
the
effect
of
the
aisles
by
twisting
the
pulpit
and
away
from
the
apse
in
the
direction
of
mecca
we
noticed
however
a
relaxation
of
bigotry
at
all
these
mosques
we
were
permitted
to
enter
without
taking
off
our
shoes
and
besides
the
figures
of
christian
art
left
in
the
mosaics
we
saw
some
moslem
pictures
among
them
rude
paintings
of
the
holy
city
mecca
on
our
way
to
the
citadel
we
stopped
to
look
at
the
arch
of
constantine
before
the
gate
of
cassander
shabby
ruin
with
four
courses
of
defaced
figures
carved
in
marble
and
representing
the
battles
and
triumphs
of
a
roman
general
fortunately
for
the
reader
we
did
not
visit
all
the
churches
of
the
city
but
we
made
the
acquaintance
in
a
greek
church
which
is
adorned
with
quaint
byzantine
paintings
of
palema
who
lies
in
public
repose
in
a
coffin
of
exquisite
silver
while
his
skull
is
enclosed
in
solid
silver
and
set
with
rubies
and
emeralds
this
may
please
palema
but
death
is
never
so
ghastly
as
when
it
is
adorned
with
jewelry
that
becomes
cheap
in
its
presence
the
view
from
the
citadel
which
embraces
the
gulf
of
salonica
and
mt
olympus
the
veritable
heaven
of
the
grecian
pantheon
and
mt
ossa
and
mt
pelion
piercing
the
blue
with
their
is
grand
enough
to
repay
the
ascent
and
there
is
a
noble
walk
along
the
wall
above
the
town
in
making
my
roundabout
way
through
modern
streets
back
to
the
bazaars
i
encountered
a
number
of
negro
women
pure
africans
who
had
the
air
and
carriage
of
the
aristocracy
of
the
place
they
rejoiced
in
the
gay
attire
which
the
natives
of
the
south
love
and
their
fine
figures
and
independent
bearing
did
not
speak
of
servitude
this
thessalonica
was
doubtless
a
healthful
and
attractive
place
at
the
time
cicero
chose
to
pass
a
portion
of
his
exile
here
but
it
has
now
a
bad
reputation
for
malaria
which
extends
to
all
the
gulf
malaria
seems
everywhere
to
have
been
one
of
the
consequences
of
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
the
handbook
recommends
the
locality
for
its
good
but
if
there
is
any
part
of
the
old
world
that
needs
rest
from
arms
i
think
it
is
this
highway
of
ancient
and
modern
conquerors
and
invaders
in
the
evening
when
the
lights
of
the
town
and
the
shore
were
reflected
in
the
water
and
a
full
moon
hung
in
the
sky
we
did
not
regret
our
delay
the
gay
thessalonians
ignorant
of
the
epistles
were
rowing
about
the
harbor
circling
round
and
round
the
steamer
beating
the
darabouka
drum
and
singing
in
that
nasal
whine
which
passes
for
music
all
over
the
east
and
indeed
on
such
a
night
it
is
not
without
its
effect
upon
a
sentimental
mind
at
early
light
of
a
cloudless
morning
we
were
going
easily
down
the
gulf
of
therma
or
salonica
having
upon
our
right
the
pierian
plain
and
i
tried
to
distinguish
the
two
mounds
which
mark
the
place
of
the
great
battle
near
pydna
one
hundred
and
years
before
christ
between
æmilius
paulus
and
king
perseus
which
gave
macedonia
to
the
roman
empire
beyond
almost
ten
thousand
feet
in
the
air
towered
olympus
upon
whose
summit
homer
displays
the
ethereal
palaces
and
inaccessible
abode
of
the
grecian
gods
shaggy
forests
still
clothe
its
sides
but
snow
now
and
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
covers
the
wide
surface
of
the
height
which
is
a
sterile
rock
the
gods
did
not
want
snow
to
cool
the
nectar
at
their
banquets
this
is
the
very
centre
of
the
mythologie
world
there
between
olympus
and
ossa
is
the
yale
of
tempe
where
the
peneus
breaking
through
a
narrow
gorge
fringed
with
the
sacred
laurel
reaches
the
gulf
south
of
ancient
heracleum
into
this
charming
but
secluded
retreat
the
gods
and
goddesses
weary
of
the
icy
air
or
the
pumblechookian
deportment
of
the
court
of
olympian
jove
descended
to
pass
the
sunny
hours
with
the
youths
and
maidens
of
mortal
mould
through
this
defile
marks
of
still
attest
the
passages
of
armies
which
flowed
either
way
in
invasion
or
retreat
and
here
pompey
after
a
ride
of
forty
miles
from
the
fatal
field
of
pharsalia
quenched
his
thirst
did
the
greeks
really
believe
that
the
gods
dwelt
on
this
mountain
in
clouds
and
snow
did
baldwin
ii
believe
that
he
sold
and
louis
ix
of
france
that
he
bought
for
ten
thousand
marks
of
silver
at
constantinople
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
veritable
crown
of
thorns
that
the
saviour
wore
in
the
of
pilate
at
six
the
cape
of
posilio
was
on
our
left
we
were
sinking
olympus
in
the
white
haze
of
morning
ossa
in
its
huge
silver
bulk
was
near
us
and
pelion
stretched
its
long
white
back
below
the
sharp
cone
of
ossa
might
well
ride
upon
the
extended
back
of
pelion
and
it
seems
a
pity
that
the
titans
did
not
succeed
in
their
attempt
we
were
leaving
and
looking
our
last
on
the
thracian
coasts
once
rimmed
from
mt
athos
to
the
bosphorus
with
a
wreath
of
prosperous
cities
what
must
once
have
been
the
splendor
of
the
ægean
sea
and
its
islands
when
every
island
was
the
seat
of
a
vigorous
state
and
every
harbor
the
site
of
a
commercial
town
which
sent
forth
adventurous
galleys
upon
any
errand
of
trade
or
conquest
since
the
fall
of
constantinople
these
coasts
and
islands
have
been
stripped
and
neglected
by
turkish
avarice
and
improvidence
and
perhaps
their
naked
aspect
is
attributable
more
to
the
last
owners
than
to
all
the
preceding
possessors
it
remained
for
the
turk
to
exhaust
nature
herself
and
to
accomplish
that
ruin
that
destruction
of
peoples
which
certainly
not
the
athenian
the
roman
or
the
macedonian
accomplished
to
destroy
that
which
survived
the
contemptible
byzantines
and
escaped
the
net
of
the
pillaging
christian
crusaders
yet
it
needs
only
repose
the
confidence
of
the
protection
of
industry
and
a
spirit
of
toleration
which
the
greeks
must
learn
as
well
as
the
turks
that
the
traveller
in
the
beginning
of
the
next
century
may
behold
in
the
archipelago
the
paradise
of
the
world
we
sailed
along
by
the
peninsula
of
magnesia
which
separates
the
ægean
from
the
bay
of
pagasæus
and
hinders
us
from
seeing
the
plains
of
thessaly
where
were
trained
the
famous
cavalry
the
perfect
union
of
horse
and
man
that
gave
rise
to
the
fable
of
centaurs
the
same
conception
of
double
prowess
which
our
own
early
settlers
exaggerated
in
the
notion
that
the
kentuckian
was
half
horse
and
half
alligator
just
before
we
entered
the
group
of
lovely
sporades
we
looked
down
the
long
narrow
inlet
to
the
bay
of
maliacus
and
saw
the
sharp
of
mt
oeta
at
the
foot
of
which
are
the
marsh
and
hot
springs
of
thermopylae
we
passed
between
skiathos
and
skopelos
rocky
islands
well
wooded
and
enlivened
with
villages
perched
on
the
hillsides
and
both
draped
in
lovely
color
in
the
strait
between
skiathos
and
magnesia
the
greek
vessels
made
a
stand
against
the
persians
until
the
defeat
at
thermopylae
compelled
a
retreat
to
salamis
the
monks
of
the
middle
ages
who
had
an
eye
for
a
fertile
land
covered
the
little
island
with
monasteries
of
which
one
only
now
remains
its
few
inhabitants
are
chiefly
sailors
and
it
would
be
wholly
without
fame
were
it
not
for
the
beauty
of
its
women
skopelos
which
is
larger
has
a
population
of
over
six
thousand
people
who
cultivate
the
olive
and
produce
a
good
red
wine
that
they
export
in
their
own
vessels
nearly
all
day
we
sailed
outside
and
along
euboea
and
the
snow
dusting
its
high
peaks
and
lonely
ravines
was
a
not
unwelcome
sight
for
the
day
was
warm
oppressively
so
even
at
sea
all
the
elements
lay
in
a
languid
truce
before
it
was
hidden
by
skopelos
mt
athos
again
asserted
its
lordship
over
these
seas
more
gigantic
than
when
we
were
close
to
it
the
sun
striking
the
snow
on
its
face
it
might
be
the
whiteface
of
the
adirondacks
except
that
it
is
piled
up
more
like
the
matterhorn
while
the
base
bathed
in
a
silver
light
was
indistinguishable
from
the
silver
water
out
of
which
it
rose
the
islands
were
all
purple
the
shores
silver
and
the
sea
around
us
deeply
azure
what
delicious
color
perhaps
it
was
better
to
coast
along
the
euboean
land
and
among
the
sporades
clothed
in
our
minds
with
the
historic
hues
which
the
atmosphere
reproduced
to
our
senses
than
to
break
the
dream
by
landing
to
find
only
broken
fragments
where
cities
once
were
and
a
handful
of
fishermen
or
shepherds
the
only
inheritors
of
the
homes
of
heroes
we
should
find
nothing
on
ikos
except
rabbits
and
a
hundred
or
two
of
fishers
perhaps
not
even
the
grave
of
peleus
the
father
of
achilles
and
the
dozen
little
rocky
islets
near
which
some
giant
in
sportive
mood
may
have
tossed
into
the
waves
would
altogether
scarcely
keep
from
famine
a
small
flock
of
industrious
sheep
skyros
however
has
not
forgotten
its
ancient
fertility
the
valleys
overlooked
by
bold
mountains
and
rocky
peaks
upon
one
of
which
stood
lofty
of
homer
song
still
bear
corn
and
wine
the
fig
and
the
olive
the
orange
and
the
lemon
as
in
the
days
when
achilles
in
woman
apparel
was
hidden
among
the
maidens
in
the
gardens
of
king
lycomedes
the
mountains
are
clothed
with
oaks
beeches
firs
and
athens
had
a
peculiar
affection
for
skyros
for
it
was
there
that
cymon
found
the
bones
of
theseus
and
transported
them
thence
to
the
temple
of
the
hero
where
they
were
deposited
with
splendid
obsequies
æschylus
and
sophocles
adding
to
the
festivities
the
friendly
rivalry
of
a
dramatic
contest
in
those
days
everything
was
for
the
state
and
nothing
for
the
man
and
is
the
fruit
of
state
was
made
immortal
by
the
genius
of
its
men
of
the
three
proud
flagstaffs
erected
in
front
of
mark
one
for
a
long
time
bore
the
banner
of
euboea
or
negropont
symbol
of
the
venetian
sovereignty
for
nearly
three
centuries
over
this
island
which
for
four
centuries
thereafter
was
to
be
cursed
by
the
ascendency
of
the
crescent
from
the
outer
shore
one
can
form
little
notion
of
the
extraordinary
fertility
of
this
land
and
we
almost
regretted
that
a
rough
sea
had
not
driven
us
to
take
the
inner
passage
by
rootia
and
through
the
narrow
euripus
where
the
town
and
the
lion
of
mark
occupy
and
guard
the
site
of
ancient
chalkis
the
turks
made
the
name
of
negropont
odious
to
the
world
but
with
the
restoration
of
the
grecian
nationality
the
ancient
name
is
restored
and
slowly
euboea
spoiled
by
the
persians
trampled
by
macedonians
and
romans
neglected
by
justinian
the
depopulator
of
the
eastern
empire
drained
by
the
venetians
blighted
by
the
osmanlis
is
beginning
to
attract
the
attention
of
capital
and
travel
by
its
unequalled
fertility
and
its
almost
unequalled
scenery
romance
mythology
and
history
start
out
of
the
waves
on
either
hand
at
twilight
we
were
entering
the
cyclades
and
beginning
to
feel
the
yet
enduring
influence
of
a
superstition
which
so
mingled
itself
with
the
supremest
art
and
culture
that
after
two
thousand
years
its
unreal
creations
are
nearly
as
mighty
as
ever
in
the
realms
of
poetry
and
imagination
these
islands
are
still
under
the
spell
of
genius
and
we
can
not
if
we
would
view
them
except
through
the
medium
of
poetic
history
i
suppose
that
the
island
of
andros
which
is
cultivated
largely
by
albanians
an
illyrian
race
having
nothing
in
common
with
the
ancient
ionians
would
little
interest
us
if
we
cared
to
taste
its
wine
it
would
be
because
it
was
once
famous
throughout
greece
and
if
we
visited
the
ruins
of
its
chief
city
it
would
be
to
recall
an
anecdote
of
herodotus
when
themistocles
besieged
the
town
and
demanded
tribute
because
the
andrians
had
been
compelled
to
join
the
fleet
of
xerxes
at
salamis
and
threatened
them
with
the
two
mighty
deities
of
athens
persuasion
and
necessity
the
spirited
islanders
replied
that
they
were
protected
by
two
churlish
gods
poverty
and
inability
it
was
eleven
at
night
when
we
sailed
between
keos
and
helena
the
latter
a
long
barren
strip
that
never
seems
to
have
been
inhabited
at
all
except
from
the
tradition
that
helen
once
landed
there
but
keos
and
its
old
town
of
iulis
was
the
home
of
legends
and
poets
and
famous
for
its
code
of
laws
one
of
which
tended
to
banish
sickness
and
old
age
from
its
precincts
by
a
provision
that
every
man
above
sixty
should
end
his
life
by
poison
its
ancient
people
had
a
reputation
for
purity
and
sobriety
which
was
probably
due
to
the
hegira
of
the
nymphs
who
were
frightened
away
to
the
mainland
by
a
roaring
lion
the
colossal
image
of
the
lion
is
still
to
be
seen
in
marble
near
the
ruins
of
the
old
city
the
island
of
the
cyclades
which
we
should
have
liked
most
to
tread
but
did
not
see
is
delos
the
holy
the
religious
and
political
centre
of
the
greek
confederation
the
birthplace
of
apollo
and
artemis
the
seat
of
the
oracle
second
only
to
that
of
delphi
the
diminutive
and
now
almost
deserted
rock
shaken
and
sunken
by
repeated
earthquakes
once
crowned
with
one
of
the
most
magnificent
temples
of
antiquity
the
spot
of
pilgrimage
the
arena
of
games
and
mystic
dances
and
poetic
contests
and
of
the
joyous
and
solemn
festivities
of
the
delian
apollo
we
were
too
late
to
see
though
we
sat
long
on
deck
and
watched
for
it
by
the
aid
of
a
full
moon
the
white
doric
columns
of
the
temple
of
minerva
on
sunium
which
are
visible
by
daylight
a
long
distance
at
sea
the
ancient
mariners
who
came
from
delos
or
from
a
more
adventurous
voyage
into
the
ægean
beheld
here
at
the
portals
of
attica
the
temple
of
its
tutelary
deity
a
welcome
and
a
beacon
and
as
they
shifted
their
sails
to
round
the
cape
they
might
have
seen
the
shining
helmet
of
the
goddess
herself
lofty
statue
of
minerva
promachus
on
the
acropolis
in
the
thought
of
the
least
classical
reader
attica
occupies
a
space
almost
as
large
as
the
rest
of
the
world
he
hopes
that
it
will
broaden
on
his
sight
as
it
does
in
his
imagination
although
he
knows
that
it
is
only
two
thirds
as
large
as
the
little
state
of
rhode
island
but
however
reason
may
modify
enthusiasm
the
diminutive
scale
on
which
everything
is
drawn
is
certain
to
disappoint
the
first
view
of
the
reality
who
he
asks
has
made
this
little
copy
of
the
great
athenian
picture
when
we
came
upon
deck
early
in
the
morning
the
steamer
lay
in
the
harbor
of
the
peninsula
of
piræus
it
is
a
round
deep
pretty
harbor
several
merchant
and
small
vessels
lay
there
a
greek
and
an
austrian
steamer
and
a
and
the
scene
did
not
lack
a
look
of
prosperous
animation
about
the
port
clusters
a
village
of
some
ten
thousand
inhabitants
many
of
whom
dwell
in
handsome
houses
it
might
be
an
american
town
it
is
too
new
to
be
european
there
at
the
entrance
of
the
harbor
on
a
low
projecting
rock
are
some
ruins
of
columns
said
to
mark
the
tomb
of
themistocles
sometimes
the
water
nearly
covers
the
rock
there
could
be
no
more
fitting
for
the
great
commander
than
this
in
sight
of
the
strait
of
salamis
and
washed
by
the
waves
that
tossed
the
broken
and
flying
fleet
of
xerxes
beyond
is
the
bay
of
phalerum
the
more
ancient
seaport
of
the
little
state
and
small
it
seems
the
plain
of
athens
enclosed
by
hymettus
pentelicus
and
parnes
this
rocky
peninsula
of
piræus
which
embraced
three
small
harbors
was
fortified
by
themistocles
with
strong
walls
that
extended
in
parallel
lines
five
miles
to
athens
between
them
ran
the
great
and
i
suppose
the
whole
distance
was
a
street
of
gardens
and
houses
a
grave
commissionnaire
do
not
know
but
he
would
call
himself
an
embassy
one
of
the
hotels
of
athens
came
off
and
quietly
took
charge
of
us
on
our
way
to
the
shore
with
our
luggage
a
customs
officer
joined
us
and
took
a
seat
in
the
boat
for
this
polite
attention
on
the
part
of
the
government
our
plenipotentiary
sent
by
the
officer
who
did
not
open
the
trunks
three
francs
to
the
treasury
but
i
do
not
know
if
it
ever
reached
its
destination
we
shunned
the
ignoble
opportunity
of
entering
the
classic
city
by
rail
and
were
soon
whirling
along
the
level
and
dusty
road
which
follows
the
course
of
the
ancient
long
wall
even
at
this
early
hour
the
day
had
become
very
warm
and
the
shade
of
the
which
line
the
road
nearly
all
the
way
was
grateful
the
fertile
fields
had
yet
the
freshness
of
spring
and
were
gay
with
scarlet
poppies
the
vines
were
thrifty
the
near
landscape
was
italian
in
character
there
was
little
peculiar
in
the
costumes
of
the
people
whom
we
met
walking
beside
their
or
saw
laboring
in
the
gardens
turbans
fezes
flowing
garments
of
white
and
blue
and
yellow
all
had
vanished
and
we
felt
that
we
were
out
of
the
orient
and
about
to
enter
a
modern
city
at
a
inn
where
we
stopped
to
water
the
horses
there
was
an
hostler
in
the
albanian
or
as
it
is
called
the
grecian
national
costume
wearing
the
fustanella
and
the
short
jacket
but
the
stiff
white
petticoat
was
rumpled
and
soiled
and
i
fancied
he
was
somewhat
ashamed
of
the
attire
and
shrank
from
inspection
like
an
actor
in
harlequin
dress
surprised
by
daylight
outside
the
theatre
this
sheepish
remnant
of
the
picturesque
could
not
preserve
for
us
any
illusions
the
roses
blooming
by
the
wayside
we
knew
the
birds
singing
in
the
fields
we
had
heard
before
the
commissionnaire
persisted
in
pointing
out
the
evidences
of
improvement
but
we
burned
with
a
secret
fever
we
were
impatient
even
of
the
grateful
avenue
of
trees
that
hid
what
we
at
every
moment
expected
to
see
i
do
not
envy
him
who
without
agitation
approaches
for
the
first
time
and
feels
that
he
is
about
to
look
upon
the
acropolis
there
are
three
supreme
sensations
not
twice
to
be
experienced
for
the
traveller
when
he
is
about
to
behold
the
ancient
seats
of
art
of
discipline
of
religion
rome
jerusalem
but
it
is
not
possible
for
the
reality
to
equal
the
expectation
cried
the
commissionnaire
the
acropolis
a
small
oblong
hill
lifting
itself
some
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
above
the
city
its
sides
upheld
by
walls
its
top
shining
with
marble
an
isolated
fortress
in
appearance
the
bulk
of
the
city
lies
to
the
north
of
the
acropolis
and
grows
round
to
the
east
of
it
along
the
valley
of
the
ilissus
in
five
minutes
more
we
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
new
excavations
of
the
keramicus
the
ancient
cemetery
and
of
the
old
walls
on
our
left
and
were
driving
up
the
straight
broad
hermes
street
towards
the
palace
midway
in
the
centre
of
the
street
is
an
ancient
byzantine
church
which
we
pass
round
hermes
street
is
intersected
by
æolus
street
these
two
cut
the
city
like
a
greek
cross
and
all
other
streets
flow
into
them
the
shops
along
the
way
are
european
the
people
in
the
streets
are
european
in
dress
the
cafés
the
tables
in
front
of
hotels
and
restaurants
with
their
groups
of
loungers
suggest
paris
by
reminding
one
of
brussels
athens
built
of
white
stone
not
yet
mellowed
by
age
is
new
bright
clean
cheerful
the
broad
streets
are
in
the
uninteresting
style
of
the
new
part
of
munich
and
due
to
the
same
bavarian
influence
if
ludwig
did
not
succeed
in
making
munich
look
like
athens
otho
was
more
fortunate
in
giving
athens
a
resemblance
to
munich
and
we
were
almost
ashamed
to
confess
how
pleasant
it
appeared
after
our
long
experience
of
the
orient
we
alighted
at
our
hotel
on
the
palace
place
ascended
steps
decked
with
flowering
plants
and
entered
cool
apartments
looking
upon
the
square
which
is
surrounded
with
handsome
buildings
planted
with
native
and
exotic
trees
and
laid
out
in
walks
and
beds
of
flowers
to
the
right
rises
the
plain
façade
of
the
royal
residence
having
behind
it
a
magnificent
garden
where
the
pine
rustles
to
the
palm
and
a
thousand
statues
revive
the
dead
mythology
beyond
rises
the
singular
cone
of
lycabettus
commendable
foresight
is
planting
the
principal
streets
with
trees
the
shade
of
which
is
much
needed
in
the
long
dry
and
parching
summer
from
the
side
windows
we
looked
also
over
the
roofs
to
the
acropolis
which
we
were
impatient
and
yet
feared
to
approach
for
myself
i
felt
like
deferring
the
decisive
moment
playing
with
my
imagination
lingering
about
among
things
i
did
not
greatly
care
for
whetting
impatience
and
desire
by
restraining
them
and
postponing
yet
a
little
the
realization
of
the
dream
of
so
many
years
stand
at
the
centre
of
the
world
thought
at
the
spring
of
its
ideal
of
beauty
while
my
companions
rested
from
the
fatigue
of
our
sea
voyage
i
went
into
the
street
and
walked
southward
towards
the
ilissus
the
air
was
bright
and
sparkling
the
sky
deep
blue
like
that
of
egypt
the
hills
sharp
and
clear
in
every
outline
and
startlingly
near
the
long
reach
of
hymettus
wears
ever
a
purple
robe
which
nature
has
given
it
in
place
of
its
pine
forests
travellers
from
constantinople
complained
of
the
heat
but
i
found
it
inspiring
the
air
had
no
languor
in
it
this
was
the
very
joyous
athens
i
had
hoped
to
see
when
you
take
up
the
favorite
uncut
periodical
of
the
month
you
like
to
skirmish
about
the
advertisements
and
tease
yourself
with
dipping
in
here
and
there
before
you
plunge
into
the
serial
novel
it
was
absurd
but
my
first
visit
in
athens
was
to
the
building
of
the
quadrennial
exposition
of
the
industry
and
art
of
greece
long
painted
wooden
structure
decked
with
flags
and
called
i
need
not
say
the
olympium
to
enter
this
imitation
of
a
country
fair
at
home
was
the
rudest
shock
one
could
give
to
the
sentiment
of
antiquity
and
perhaps
a
dangerous
experiment
however
strong
in
the
mind
might
be
the
subtone
of
acropolis
the
greek
gentleman
who
accompanied
me
said
that
the
exhibition
was
a
great
improvement
over
the
one
four
years
before
it
was
in
fact
a
very
hopeful
sign
of
the
prosperity
of
the
new
state
there
was
a
good
display
of
cereals
and
fruits
of
silk
and
of
jewelry
and
various
work
in
gold
and
silver
latter
all
from
corfu
but
from
the
specimens
of
the
fine
arts
in
painting
and
sculpture
i
think
the
ancient
greeks
have
not
much
to
fear
or
to
hope
from
the
modern
and
the
books
in
printing
and
binding
were
rude
enough
but
the
specimens
from
the
mines
and
quarries
of
greece
could
not
be
excelled
elsewhere
the
hundred
varieties
of
exquisite
marbles
detained
us
long
there
were
some
polished
blocks
lovely
in
color
and
you
might
almost
say
in
design
that
you
would
like
to
frame
and
hang
as
pictures
on
the
wall
another
sign
of
the
decadence
of
the
national
costume
perhaps
more
significant
than
its
disappearance
in
the
streets
was
its
exhibition
here
upon
lay
figures
i
saw
a
countryman
who
wore
it
sneaking
round
one
of
these
figures
and
regarding
it
with
the
curiosity
of
a
savage
who
for
the
first
time
sees
himself
in
a
mirror
since
the
revolution
the
albanian
has
been
adopted
as
the
grecian
costume
in
default
of
anything
more
characteristic
and
perhaps
because
it
would
puzzle
one
to
say
of
what
race
the
person
calling
himself
a
modern
greek
is
but
the
ridiculous
fustanella
is
nearly
discarded
it
is
both
inconvenient
and
costly
to
make
one
of
the
proper
fulness
requires
forty
yards
of
cotton
cloth
this
is
gathered
at
the
waist
and
hangs
in
broad
pleats
to
the
knees
and
it
is
starched
so
stiffly
that
it
stands
out
like
a
chinese
umbrella
as
the
garment
can
not
be
worn
when
it
is
the
least
soiled
and
must
be
done
up
and
starched
two
or
three
times
a
week
the
wearer
finds
it
an
expensive
habit
and
in
the
whole
jacket
and
sleeves
may
be
a
reminiscence
of
defensive
has
the
appearance
of
a
landsknecht
above
and
a
below
nearly
as
rare
in
the
streets
as
this
dress
are
the
drooping
red
caps
with
tassels
of
blue
the
women
of
athens
whom
we
saw
would
not
take
a
premium
anywhere
for
beauty
but
we
noticed
here
and
there
one
who
wore
upon
her
dark
locks
the
long
hanging
red
fez
and
gold
tassel
who
might
have
attracted
the
eye
of
a
roving
poet
and
been
passed
down
to
the
next
age
as
the
maid
of
athens
the
athenian
men
of
the
present
are
a
fine
race
we
were
constantly
surprised
by
noble
forms
and
intelligent
faces
that
they
are
greek
in
feature
or
expression
as
we
know
the
greek
from
coins
and
statuary
we
could
not
say
perhaps
it
was
only
the
ancient
lacedemonian
rivalry
that
prompted
the
remark
of
a
gentleman
in
athens
who
was
born
in
sparta
that
there
is
not
a
drop
of
the
ancient
athenian
blood
in
athens
there
are
some
patrician
families
in
the
city
who
claim
this
honorable
descent
but
it
is
probable
that
athens
is
less
greek
than
any
other
town
in
the
kingdom
and
that
if
there
remain
any
hellenic
descendants
they
must
be
sought
in
remote
districts
of
the
morea
if
we
trusted
ourselves
to
decide
by
types
of
face
we
should
say
that
the
present
inhabitants
of
athens
were
of
northern
origin
and
that
their
relation
to
the
greeks
was
no
stronger
than
that
of
englishmen
to
the
ancient
britons
that
the
people
who
now
inhabit
attica
and
the
peloponnesus
are
descendants
of
the
greeks
whom
the
romans
conquered
i
suppose
no
one
can
successfully
claim
that
they
are
all
from
the
slavonians
who
so
long
held
and
almost
exclusively
occupied
the
greek
mainland
it
is
equally
difficult
to
prove
all
we
know
is
that
the
greek
language
has
survived
the
byzantine
anarchy
the
slavonic
conquest
the
frank
occupation
and
that
the
nimble
wit
the
acquisitiveness
and
inquisitiveness
the
cunning
and
craft
of
the
modern
greek
seem
to
be
the
perversion
of
the
nobler
and
yet
not
altogether
dissimilar
qualities
which
made
the
ancient
greeks
the
leaders
of
the
human
race
and
those
who
ascribe
the
character
of
a
people
to
climate
and
geographical
position
may
expect
to
see
the
mongrel
inheritors
of
the
ancient
soil
moulded
by
the
enduring
influences
of
nature
into
homogeneity
and
reproduce
in
a
measure
a
copy
of
that
splendid
civilization
of
whose
ruins
they
are
now
unappreciative
possessors
beyond
the
temporary
olympium
the
eye
is
caught
by
the
arch
of
hadrian
and
fascinated
by
the
towering
corinthian
columns
of
the
olympicum
or
temple
of
jupiter
against
the
background
of
hymettus
and
the
blue
sky
stood
fourteen
of
these
beautiful
columns
all
that
remain
of
the
original
one
hundred
and
but
enough
to
give
us
an
impression
of
what
was
one
of
the
most
stately
buildings
of
antiquity
this
temple
which
was
begun
by
pisistratus
was
not
finished
till
hadrian
time
or
until
the
worship
of
jupiter
had
become
cold
and
sceptical
the
columns
stand
upon
a
terrace
overlooking
the
bed
of
the
hissus
there
coffee
is
served
and
there
we
more
than
once
sat
at
sundown
and
saw
the
vast
columns
turn
from
rose
to
gray
in
the
fading
light
athens
like
every
other
city
of
europe
in
this
age
of
science
and
christianity
was
full
of
soldiers
we
saw
squads
of
them
drilling
here
and
there
their
uniforms
sprinkled
the
streets
and
the
cafés
and
their
regimental
bands
enlivened
the
town
the
greeks
like
all
the
rest
of
us
are
beating
their
into
spears
and
preparing
for
the
millennium
if
there
was
not
much
that
is
peculiar
to
interest
us
in
wandering
about
among
the
shops
and
the
but
unroofed
and
not
real
bazaars
there
was
much
to
astonish
us
in
the
size
and
growth
of
a
city
of
over
fifty
thousand
inhabitants
in
forty
years
from
the
heap
of
ruins
and
ashes
which
the
turks
left
it
when
the
venerable
american
missionaries
hill
and
his
wife
came
to
the
city
they
were
obliged
to
find
shelter
in
a
portion
of
a
ruined
tower
and
they
began
their
labors
literally
in
a
field
of
smoking
desolation
the
only
attractive
shops
are
those
of
the
antiquity
dealers
the
collectors
of
coins
vases
statuettes
and
figurines
of
course
the
extraordinary
demand
for
these
most
exquisite
mementos
of
a
race
of
artists
has
created
a
host
of
imitations
and
set
an
extravagant
and
fictitious
price
upon
most
of
the
articles
a
price
which
the
professor
who
lets
you
have
a
specimen
as
a
favor
or
the
dealer
who
calmly
assumes
that
he
has
gathered
the
last
relics
of
antiquity
mentions
with
equal
equanimity
i
looked
in
the
face
of
a
handsome
graybeard
who
asked
me
two
thousand
francs
for
a
silver
coin
which
he
said
was
a
solon
to
see
if
there
was
any
guile
in
his
eye
but
there
was
not
i
can
not
but
hope
that
this
race
which
has
learned
to
look
honest
will
some
time
become
so
late
in
the
afternoon
we
walked
around
the
south
side
of
the
acropolis
past
the
ruins
of
theatres
that
strew
its
side
and
ascended
by
the
to
the
only
entrance
at
the
southwest
end
of
the
hill
towards
the
piræus
we
pass
through
a
gate
pierced
in
the
side
wall
and
come
to
the
front
of
the
propylæa
the
noblest
gateway
ever
built
at
the
risk
of
offending
the
travelled
i
shall
try
in
a
paragraph
to
put
the
untravelled
reader
in
possession
of
the
main
features
of
this
glorious
spot
the
acropolis
is
an
irregular
oblong
hill
the
somewhat
uneven
summit
of
which
is
about
eleven
hundred
feet
long
by
four
hundred
and
fifty
feet
broad
at
its
widest
the
hill
is
steep
on
all
sides
and
its
final
spring
is
perpendicular
rock
in
places
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
it
is
lowest
at
the
southwest
end
where
it
dips
down
and
by
a
rocky
neck
joins
the
areopagus
or
mars
hill
across
this
end
is
built
the
propylæa
high
with
reference
to
the
surrounding
country
and
commanding
the
view
but
low
enough
not
to
hide
from
a
little
distance
the
buildings
on
the
summit
this
building
which
is
of
the
doric
order
and
of
pure
pentelic
marble
was
the
pride
of
the
athenians
its
entire
front
is
about
one
hundred
and
seventy
feet
this
includes
the
central
portico
pierced
with
five
entrances
the
centre
one
for
carriages
and
the
forward
projecting
north
and
south
wings
in
the
north
wing
was
the
the
south
wing
was
never
completed
to
correspond
but
the
balance
is
preserved
by
the
little
temple
of
the
wingless
victory
which
from
its
ruins
has
been
restored
to
its
original
form
and
beauty
the
propylæa
is
approached
by
broad
flights
of
marble
steps
which
were
defended
by
fortifications
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
the
distant
reader
may
form
a
little
conception
of
the
original
splendor
of
this
gateway
from
its
cost
which
was
nearly
two
and
a
half
millions
of
dollars
and
by
remembering
that
it
was
built
under
the
direction
of
pericles
at
a
time
when
the
cost
of
a
building
represented
its
real
value
and
not
the
profits
of
city
officials
and
contractors
passing
slowly
between
the
columns
and
with
many
a
backward
glance
over
the
historic
landscape
lingering
yet
lest
we
should
abruptly
break
the
spell
we
came
into
the
area
straight
before
us
up
the
red
rock
ran
the
seamed
across
with
to
prevent
the
horses
hoofs
from
slipping
and
worn
in
deep
ruts
by
heavy
in
the
field
before
us
a
mass
of
broken
marble
on
the
right
the
creamy
columns
of
the
parthenon
on
the
left
the
irregular
but
beautiful
ionic
erechtheum
the
reader
sees
that
the
entrance
was
contrived
so
that
the
beholder
first
view
of
the
parthenon
should
be
at
the
angle
which
best
exhibits
its
exquisite
proportions
we
were
alone
the
soldier
detailed
to
watch
that
we
did
not
carry
off
any
of
the
columns
sat
down
upon
a
broken
fragment
by
the
entrance
and
let
us
wander
at
our
will
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would
if
i
could
have
the
temples
restored
there
is
an
indescribable
pathos
in
these
fragments
of
columns
and
architraves
and
walls
in
these
broken
sculptures
and
marred
inscriptions
which
time
has
softened
to
the
loveliest
tints
and
in
these
tottering
buildings
which
no
human
skill
if
it
could
restore
the
pristine
beauty
could
reanimate
with
the
greek
idealism
and
yet
as
we
sat
upon
the
western
steps
of
the
temple
dedicated
to
pallas
athene
i
could
imagine
what
this
area
was
say
in
the
august
days
of
the
great
panathenaic
festival
when
the
gorgeous
procession
which
i
saw
filing
along
the
via
sacra
returning
from
eleusis
swept
up
these
broad
steps
garlanded
with
flowers
and
singing
the
hymn
to
the
protecting
goddess
this
platform
was
not
then
a
desolate
stone
heap
but
peopled
with
almost
living
statues
in
bronze
and
marble
the
creations
of
the
genius
of
phidias
of
praxiteles
of
lycius
of
clecetas
of
myron
there
between
the
two
great
temples
but
overtopping
them
both
stood
the
bronze
figure
of
minerva
promachus
cast
by
phidias
out
of
the
spoils
of
marathon
whose
glittering
helmet
and
gladdened
the
returning
mariner
when
far
at
sea
and
defied
the
distant
watcher
on
the
acropolis
of
corinth
first
in
the
procession
come
the
sacrificial
oxen
and
then
follow
in
order
a
band
of
virgins
the
quadriga
each
drawn
by
four
noble
steeds
the
élite
of
the
athenian
youth
on
horseback
magistrates
daughters
of
noble
citizens
bearing
vases
and
pateræ
men
carrying
trays
of
offerings
and
the
chorus
singers
they
pass
around
to
the
entrance
of
the
parthenon
which
is
toward
the
east
and
those
who
are
permitted
enter
the
naos
and
come
into
the
presence
of
the
statue
of
minerva
the
undraped
portions
of
this
statue
show
the
ivory
the
drapery
was
of
solid
gold
made
so
that
it
could
be
removed
in
time
of
danger
from
a
public
enemy
the
golden
plates
weighed
ten
thousand
pounds
this
work
of
phidias
since
it
was
celebrated
as
the
perfection
of
art
by
the
best
judges
of
art
must
have
been
as
exquisite
in
its
details
as
it
was
harmonious
in
its
proportions
but
no
artist
of
our
day
would
dare
to
attempt
to
construct
a
statue
in
that
manner
in
its
right
outstretched
hand
it
held
a
statue
of
victory
four
cubits
high
and
although
it
was
erected
nearly
five
hundred
years
before
the
christian
era
we
are
curious
to
notice
the
already
decided
influence
of
egyptian
ideas
in
the
figure
of
the
sphinx
surmounting
the
helmet
of
the
goddess
the
sun
was
setting
behind
the
island
of
salamis
there
was
a
rosy
glow
on
the
bay
of
phalerum
on
the
sea
to
the
south
on
the
side
of
hymettus
on
the
yellow
columns
of
the
parthenon
on
the
temple
of
the
wingless
victory
and
on
the
faces
of
the
caryatides
in
the
portico
of
the
erechtheum
who
stand
reverently
facing
the
parthenon
worshipping
now
only
the
vacant
pedestal
of
athene
the
protector
what
overpowering
associations
throng
the
mind
as
one
looks
off
upon
the
crooked
strait
of
salamis
down
upon
the
bare
rock
of
the
areopagus
upon
the
pnyx
and
the
bema
where
we
know
demosthenes
solon
themistocles
pericles
aristides
were
wont
to
address
the
populace
who
crowded
up
from
this
valley
the
agora
the
tumultuous
to
listen
upon
the
museum
hill
crowned
by
the
monument
of
philopappus
pierced
by
grottos
one
of
which
tradition
calls
the
prison
of
socrates
whole
history
of
athens
is
in
a
nutshell
yet
if
one
were
predetermined
to
despise
this
mite
of
a
republic
in
the
compass
of
a
quart
measure
he
could
not
do
it
here
a
little
of
cæsar
dust
outweighs
the
world
we
are
not
imposed
upon
by
names
it
was
it
could
only
have
been
in
comparison
with
modern
naval
engagements
a
petty
fight
in
the
narrow
limits
of
that
strait
and
yet
neither
the
persian
soldiers
who
watched
it
from
the
acropolis
and
in
terror
saw
the
ships
of
xerxes
flying
down
the
bay
nor
the
athenians
who
had
abandoned
their
citadel
and
trusted
their
all
to
the
of
their
ships
could
have
imagined
that
the
result
was
laden
with
such
consequences
it
gives
us
pause
to
think
what
course
all
subsequent
history
would
have
taken
what
would
be
the
present
complexion
of
the
christian
system
itself
if
on
that
day
asiatic
barbarism
had
rendered
impossible
the
subsequent
development
of
grecian
art
and
philosophy
we
waited
on
the
acropolis
for
the
night
and
the
starlight
and
the
thousand
lights
in
the
city
spread
below
but
we
did
not
stay
for
the
slow
coming
of
the
midnight
moon
over
hymettus
on
sunday
morning
we
worshipped
with
the
greeks
in
the
beautiful
russian
church
the
interior
is
small
but
rich
and
is
like
a
private
parlor
there
are
no
seats
and
the
worshippers
stand
or
kneel
while
gilded
and
painted
figures
of
saints
and
angels
encompass
them
the
ceremony
is
simple
but
impressive
the
priests
are
in
gorgeous
robes
of
blue
and
silver
sing
soprano
and
the
bass
as
it
always
is
in
russian
churches
is
magnificent
a
lady
tall
elegant
superb
in
black
faced
and
trimmed
with
a
stuff
of
gold
sweeps
up
to
the
desks
kisses
the
books
and
the
crucifix
and
then
stands
one
side
crossing
herself
we
are
most
of
us
mortal
and
all
however
rich
in
apparel
poor
sinners
one
day
in
the
week
no
one
of
the
worshippers
carries
a
there
is
reading
behind
the
screen
and
presently
the
priests
bring
out
the
elements
of
communion
and
exhibit
them
the
one
carrying
the
bread
in
a
silver
vessel
on
his
head
and
the
other
the
wine
the
central
doors
are
then
closed
on
the
mysterious
consecration
at
the
end
of
the
service
the
holy
elements
are
brought
out
the
communicants
press
up
kiss
the
cross
take
a
piece
of
bread
and
then
turn
and
salute
their
friends
and
break
up
in
a
cheerful
clatter
of
talk
in
contrast
to
this
we
attended
afterwards
the
little
meeting
in
an
upper
chamber
of
the
greek
converts
of
the
american
mission
and
listened
to
a
sermon
in
greek
which
inculcated
the
religion
of
new
england
gospel
which
with
the
aid
of
schools
makes
slow
but
hopeful
progress
in
the
city
of
the
unknown
god
the
longer
one
remains
in
athens
the
more
he
will
be
impressed
with
two
things
the
one
is
the
perfection
of
the
old
art
and
civilization
and
what
must
have
been
the
vivacious
joyous
life
of
the
ancient
athenians
in
a
climate
so
vital
when
this
plain
was
a
garden
and
these
beautiful
hills
were
clad
with
forests
and
the
whispers
of
the
pine
answered
the
murmurs
of
the
sea
the
other
is
the
revival
of
letters
and
architecture
and
culture
visible
from
day
to
day
in
a
progress
as
astonishing
as
can
be
seen
in
any
occidental
city
i
can
not
undertake
to
describe
not
even
to
mention
the
many
noble
buildings
either
built
or
in
construction
from
the
quarries
of
pentelicus
university
the
academy
the
new
olympium
the
voluntary
contributions
of
wealthy
greeks
most
of
them
merchants
in
foreign
cities
whose
highest
ambition
seems
to
be
to
restore
athens
to
something
of
its
former
splendor
it
is
a
point
of
honor
with
every
greek
in
whatever
foreign
city
he
may
live
and
die
to
leave
something
in
his
last
will
for
the
adornment
or
education
of
the
city
of
his
patriotic
devotion
in
this
if
in
nothing
else
they
resemble
the
ancient
patriots
who
thought
no
sacrifice
too
costly
for
the
republic
among
the
ruins
we
find
no
palaces
no
sign
that
the
richest
citizen
used
his
wealth
in
ostentatious
private
mansions
although
some
of
the
greek
merchants
now
build
for
themselves
elegant
villas
the
next
generation
will
see
the
evidences
of
their
wealth
rather
in
the
public
buildings
they
have
erected
in
this
little
city
the
university
has
eighty
professors
and
over
twelve
hundred
students
gathered
from
all
parts
of
greece
there
are
in
the
city
forty
lady
teachers
with
eight
hundred
female
pupils
and
besides
these
there
are
two
gymnasiums
and
several
graded
schools
professors
and
teachers
are
well
paid
and
the
schools
are
free
even
to
the
use
of
books
the
means
flow
from
the
same
liberality
that
of
the
greek
merchants
who
are
continually
leaving
money
for
new
educational
foundations
there
is
but
one
shadow
upon
this
hopeful
picture
and
that
is
the
bigotry
of
the
greek
church
to
which
the
government
yields
i
do
not
now
speak
of
the
former
persecutions
suffered
by
the
protestant
missionaries
but
recently
the
schools
for
girls
opened
by
protestants
and
which
have
been
of
the
highest
service
in
the
education
of
women
have
been
obliged
to
close
or
else
to
the
greek
religion
and
admit
priestly
teachers
at
the
time
of
our
visit
one
of
the
best
of
them
that
of
miss
kyle
of
new
york
was
only
tolerated
from
week
to
week
under
perpetual
warnings
and
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
suppressed
by
the
police
this
narrow
policy
is
a
disgrace
to
the
government
and
if
it
is
continued
must
incline
the
world
to
hope
that
the
greeks
will
never
displace
the
moslems
in
constantinople
in
the
front
of
the
university
stands
a
very
good
statue
of
the
korais
and
in
the
library
we
saw
the
busts
of
other
distinguished
natives
and
foreigners
the
library
which
is
every
day
enriched
by
private
gifts
boasts
already
over
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
volumes
as
we
walked
through
the
rooms
the
director
said
that
the
university
had
no
bust
of
an
american
though
it
had
often
been
promised
one
i
suggested
one
of
lincoln
no
he
wanted
washington
he
said
he
cared
to
have
no
other
i
did
not
tell
him
that
washington
was
one
of
the
heroes
of
our
mythic
period
that
we
had
filled
up
a
tolerably
large
pantheon
since
then
and
that
a
century
in
america
was
as
good
as
a
thousand
years
in
byzantium
but
i
fell
into
something
of
a
historic
revery
over
the
apparent
fact
that
america
is
as
yet
to
greece
nothing
but
the
land
of
washington
and
i
rather
liked
the
notion
and
felt
sure
that
there
must
be
somewhere
in
the
united
states
an
antiquated
and
rich
patriot
who
remembered
washington
and
would
like
to
send
a
marble
portrait
of
our
one
great
man
to
the
university
of
athens
plato
academe
etc
there
was
a
nightingale
who
sang
and
sobbed
all
night
in
the
garden
before
the
hotel
and
only
ceased
her
plaintive
reminiscence
of
athenian
song
and
sorrow
with
the
red
dawn
but
this
is
a
sad
world
of
contrasts
called
upon
the
balcony
at
midnight
by
her
wild
notes
i
saw
can
i
ever
say
it
the
balcony
below
a
white
figure
advance
and
with
a
tragic
movement
of
haste
if
not
of
rage
draw
his
garment
of
the
night
over
his
head
and
shake
it
out
over
the
public
square
and
i
the
kingdom
of
knowledge
comes
by
experience
as
well
as
by
the
lively
flea
was
as
wakeful
in
greece
as
the
nightingale
in
the
morning
the
arose
seems
to
blow
constantly
from
boeotia
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
day
was
bright
and
sparkling
and
we
took
carriage
for
eleusis
it
might
have
been
such
a
the
ancient
athenians
always
anticipated
the
dawn
in
their
the
panathenaic
processions
moved
along
this
very
via
sacra
to
celebrate
the
mysteries
of
ceres
at
eleusis
all
the
hills
stood
in
clear
outline
pentelicus
and
the
wavy
lines
of
parnes
and
corydallus
we
drove
over
the
lovely
and
fertile
plain
amid
the
of
the
kephissus
and
up
the
stony
slope
to
the
narrowing
pass
of
daphne
a
defile
in
mt
ægaleos
but
we
sought
in
vain
the
laurel
grove
or
a
single
specimen
of
that
tree
whose
twisted
trunk
and
outstretched
arms
express
the
struggle
of
vanishing
humanity
passing
on
our
right
the
chapel
of
elias
on
a
commanding
eminence
and
traversing
the
level
plateau
of
the
rocky
gorge
we
alighted
at
the
monastery
of
daphne
whose
cloister
and
chapel
occupy
the
site
of
a
temple
of
apollo
we
sat
for
half
an
hour
in
its
quiet
walled
churchyard
carpeted
with
poppies
and
tender
flowers
of
spring
amid
the
remains
of
old
columns
and
fragments
of
white
marble
sparkling
amid
the
green
grass
and
blue
violets
and
looked
upon
the
blue
bay
of
eleusis
and
salamis
and
the
heights
of
megara
beyond
surely
nature
has
a
tenderness
for
such
a
spot
and
i
fancied
that
even
the
old
dame
who
unlocked
for
us
the
chapel
and
its
cheap
treasures
showed
us
with
some
interest
in
a
carving
here
and
a
capital
there
the
relics
of
a
former
religion
and
perhaps
mingled
with
her
adoration
of
the
virgin
and
the
bambino
a
lurking
regard
for
venus
and
apollo
a
mile
beyond
at
the
foot
of
a
rocky
precipice
are
pointed
out
the
foundations
of
a
temple
of
venus
where
the
handbook
assured
us
doves
had
been
found
carved
in
white
marble
none
were
left
however
for
us
and
we
contented
ourselves
with
reading
on
the
rock
phile
aphrodite
and
making
a
vain
effort
to
recall
life
to
this
sterile
region
enchanting
was
the
view
as
we
drove
down
the
opening
pass
to
the
bay
which
spreads
out
a
broad
sheet
completely
landlocked
by
the
irregular
bulk
of
salamis
island
when
we
emerged
through
the
defile
we
turned
away
from
the
narrow
strait
where
the
battle
was
fought
and
from
the
on
which
xerxes
sat
a
crowned
spectator
of
his
ruin
and
swept
around
the
circular
shore
past
the
rheiti
or
greenish
pools
over
the
level
thriasian
plain
the
bay
of
eleusis
guarded
by
the
lofty
amphitheatre
of
mountains
the
curving
sweep
of
ægaleos
and
kithæron
and
by
salamis
is
like
a
lovely
lake
and
if
anywhere
on
earth
there
could
be
peace
you
would
say
it
would
be
on
its
sunny
and
secluded
shores
salamis
appears
only
a
bare
and
rocky
island
but
the
vine
still
flourishes
in
the
scant
soil
and
from
its
the
descendants
of
the
attic
bees
make
honey
as
famous
as
that
of
two
thousand
years
ago
across
the
bay
upon
a
jutting
rocky
point
above
which
rises
the
crown
of
its
acropolis
lies
the
straggling
miserable
village
of
eleusis
our
first
note
of
approach
to
it
was
an
ancient
pavement
and
a
few
indistinguishable
fragments
of
walls
and
columns
in
a
shallow
stream
which
ran
over
the
stones
the
women
of
the
town
were
washing
clothes
and
throngs
of
girls
were
filling
their
pails
of
brass
at
an
old
well
as
of
old
at
the
same
place
did
the
daughters
of
keleos
shriller
tones
and
laughter
mingled
with
their
incessant
chatter
as
we
approached
and
we
thought
it
was
imagination
little
wild
defiance
and
dislike
i
had
noticed
already
in
athens
and
again
here
the
extraordinary
rapidity
with
which
the
greeks
in
conversation
exchange
words
i
think
they
are
the
fastest
talkers
in
the
world
and
the
greek
has
a
hard
sharp
ringing
metallic
sound
it
is
staccato
you
can
see
how
easily
aristophanes
imitated
the
of
frogs
i
have
heard
two
women
whose
rapid
incessant
cackle
sounded
exactly
like
the
conversation
of
hens
the
sculptor
need
not
go
further
than
these
maids
for
classic
forms
the
rounded
limbs
the
generous
bust
the
symmetrical
waist
which
fashion
has
not
made
an
to
mark
the
flight
of
time
and
health
the
mothers
of
heroes
were
of
this
mould
although
i
will
not
say
that
some
of
them
were
not
a
trifle
stout
for
grace
and
that
their
faces
would
not
have
been
improved
by
the
interior
light
of
a
little
culture
their
simple
dress
was
a
white
short
chemise
that
left
the
legs
bare
a
heavy
and
worked
tunic
like
that
worn
by
men
and
a
colored
kerchief
tied
about
the
head
many
of
the
men
of
the
village
wore
the
fustanella
and
the
full
albanian
costume
the
temple
of
ceres
lies
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
only
a
little
portion
of
its
vast
extent
has
been
relieved
of
the
superincumbent
accumulated
soil
and
in
fact
its
excavation
is
difficult
because
the
village
is
built
over
the
greater
part
of
it
what
we
saw
was
only
a
confused
heap
of
marble
some
pieces
finely
carved
arches
capitals
and
shattered
columns
the
greek
government
which
is
earnestly
caring
for
the
remains
of
antiquity
and
diligently
collecting
everything
for
the
national
museum
down
to
broken
toes
and
fingers
has
stationed
a
keeper
over
the
ruins
and
he
showed
us
in
a
wooden
shanty
the
interesting
fragments
of
statues
which
had
been
found
in
the
excavation
i
coveted
a
little
hand
plump
with
tapering
fingers
which
the
conservator
permitted
us
to
hold
slight
but
a
most
suggestive
memento
of
the
breeding
and
beauty
of
the
lady
who
was
the
sculptor
model
and
it
did
not
so
much
seem
a
dead
hand
stretched
out
to
us
from
the
past
as
a
living
thing
which
returned
our
furtive
pressure
we
climbed
up
the
hill
where
the
fortress
of
the
acropolis
stood
and
where
there
is
now
a
little
chapel
every
grecian
city
seems
to
have
had
its
acropolis
the
first
nucleus
of
the
rude
tribe
which
it
fortified
against
incursion
and
the
subsequent
site
of
temples
to
the
gods
the
traveller
will
find
these
steep
hills
rising
out
of
plains
everywhere
from
ephesus
to
argos
and
will
almost
conclude
that
nature
had
consciously
adapted
herself
to
the
wants
of
the
aboriginal
occupants
it
is
well
worth
ascending
this
summit
to
get
the
fine
view
of
plain
and
bay
of
mt
kerata
and
its
double
peaks
and
the
road
that
pierces
the
pass
of
kithæron
and
leads
to
the
field
of
platæa
and
the
remains
of
thebes
in
a
little
near
the
ruins
protected
from
the
wind
and
the
importunate
swarms
of
children
we
ate
our
lunch
and
tried
to
impress
ourselves
with
the
knowledge
that
æschylus
was
born
in
eleusis
and
to
imagine
the
nature
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
the
concealed
representations
by
which
the
ancients
attempted
to
symbolize
in
the
myths
of
ceres
and
proserpine
the
primal
forces
of
nature
perhaps
the
dim
suggestions
of
immortality
secret
not
to
be
shared
by
the
vulgar
from
the
deep
wisdom
of
the
egyptians
the
children
of
eleusis
deserve
more
space
than
i
can
afford
them
since
they
devoted
their
entire
time
to
our
annoyance
they
are
handsome
rascals
and
there
were
enough
of
them
if
they
had
been
sufficiently
clothed
to
form
a
large
sunday
school
when
we
sat
down
in
the
ruins
and
tried
to
meditate
on
ceres
they
swarmed
about
us
capering
and
yelling
incessantly
and
when
i
made
a
charge
upon
them
they
scattered
over
the
rocks
and
saluted
us
with
stones
but
i
find
that
at
this
distance
i
have
nothing
against
them
i
recall
only
their
beauty
and
vivacity
and
if
they
were
the
worst
children
that
ever
tormented
travellers
i
reflect
yes
but
they
were
greeks
and
the
gods
loved
their
grandmothers
one
slender
girl
offered
me
a
silver
coin
i
saw
that
it
was
a
beautiful
athenian
piece
of
the
time
of
pericles
and
after
some
bargaining
i
bought
it
of
her
for
a
reasonable
price
but
as
we
moved
away
to
our
carriage
i
was
followed
by
the
men
and
women
of
the
settlement
who
demanded
it
back
they
looked
murder
and
talked
greek
i
inquired
how
much
they
wanted
fifty
francs
but
that
is
twice
as
much
as
it
is
worth
in
athens
and
the
coin
was
surrendered
all
through
the
country
the
peasants
have
a
most
exaggerated
notion
of
the
value
of
anything
antique
we
returned
through
the
pass
of
daphne
and
by
the
site
of
the
academic
grove
of
plato
though
and
gardens
of
pomegranates
in
scarlet
bloom
quinces
roses
and
jasmines
the
air
sweet
and
delightful
perhaps
nowhere
else
can
the
traveller
so
enter
into
the
pure
spirit
of
attic
thought
and
feeling
as
among
these
scattered
remains
that
scholars
have
agreed
to
call
the
ruins
of
academe
we
turned
through
a
lane
into
the
garden
of
a
watered
by
a
branch
rivulet
of
the
kephissus
what
we
saw
was
not
much
marble
columns
under
a
lovely
some
fragments
of
antique
carving
built
into
a
wall
but
we
saw
it
as
it
were
privately
and
with
a
feeling
of
the
presence
of
the
mighty
shade
and
then
under
a
row
of
young
by
the
meagre
stream
we
reclined
on
ripe
in
full
sight
of
the
acropolis
the
most
poetic
view
of
that
magnetic
hill
so
plato
saw
it
as
he
strolled
along
this
bank
and
listened
to
the
wisdom
of
his
master
socrates
or
pacing
the
colonnade
of
the
academe
meditated
the
republic
here
indeed
aristotle
who
was
born
the
year
that
plato
died
may
have
lain
and
woven
that
subtle
web
of
metaphysics
which
no
subsequent
system
of
thought
or
religion
has
been
able
to
disregard
the
wind
blew
strong
and
fresh
through
the
trees
and
the
scent
of
flowers
and
odorous
shrubs
the
murmur
of
the
leaves
the
unchanged
blue
vault
of
heaven
the
near
hill
of
the
sacred
colonus
celebrated
by
sophocles
as
the
scene
of
the
death
of
odipus
all
conspired
to
flood
us
with
the
poetic
past
what
intimations
of
immortality
do
we
need
since
the
spell
of
genius
is
so
deathless
after
dinner
we
laboriously
by
a
zigzag
path
climbed
the
sharp
cone
of
lycabettus
whose
six
hundred
and
fifty
feet
of
height
commands
the
whole
region
the
rock
summit
has
just
room
enough
for
a
tiny
chapel
called
of
george
and
a
narrow
platform
in
front
where
we
sat
in
the
shelter
of
the
building
and
feasted
upon
the
prospect
at
sunset
it
is
a
marvellous
view
athens
and
its
plain
the
bays
salamis
and
the
strait
of
the
battle
megara
hymettus
pentelicus
kithæron
when
in
descending
we
had
nearly
reached
the
foot
on
the
west
side
we
heard
the
violent
ringing
of
a
bell
high
above
us
and
turning
about
saw
what
seemed
to
be
a
chapel
under
the
northwest
edge
of
the
rock
upon
which
we
had
lately
stood
bandits
in
laced
leggings
and
embroidered
jackets
chattering
girls
in
short
skirts
and
gay
kerchiefs
were
descending
the
wandering
path
and
the
clamor
of
the
bell
piqued
our
curiosity
to
turn
and
ascend
when
we
reached
our
goal
the
affair
seemed
to
be
pretty
much
all
bell
and
nobody
but
a
boy
in
the
lusty
exuberance
of
youth
could
have
made
so
much
noise
by
the
swinging
of
a
single
clapper
in
a
niche
or
rather
cleft
in
the
rock
was
a
and
a
boy
whose
piety
seemed
inspired
by
the
devil
was
hauling
the
rope
and
sending
the
sonorous
metal
over
and
over
on
its
axis
in
front
of
the
bell
is
a
narrow
terrace
sufficient
however
to
support
three
under
which
were
tables
and
benches
and
upon
the
low
were
planted
half
a
dozen
large
and
differently
colored
national
banners
a
hole
in
the
rock
was
utilized
as
a
fireplace
and
from
a
pot
over
the
coals
came
the
fumes
of
coffee
upon
this
perch
of
a
terrace
people
sat
sipping
coffee
and
looking
down
upon
the
city
whose
evening
lights
were
just
beginning
to
twinkle
here
and
there
behind
the
belfry
is
a
chapel
perhaps
ten
feet
by
twelve
partly
a
natural
grotto
and
partly
built
of
rough
stones
it
was
brilliantly
lighted
with
tapers
and
hung
with
quaint
pictures
at
the
entrance
which
is
a
door
cut
in
the
rock
stood
a
greek
priest
and
an
official
in
uniform
selling
and
raking
in
the
leptas
of
the
devout
we
threw
down
some
coppers
declined
the
tapers
and
walked
in
the
adytum
of
the
priest
was
wholly
in
the
solid
rock
there
seemed
to
be
no
service
but
the
women
and
children
stood
and
crossed
themselves
and
passionately
kissed
the
poor
pictures
on
the
walls
yet
there
was
nothing
exclusive
or
pharisaic
in
the
worshippers
for
priest
and
people
showed
us
friendly
faces
and
cordially
returned
our
greetings
the
whole
rock
quivered
with
the
clang
of
the
bell
for
the
boy
at
the
rope
leaped
at
his
task
and
with
fury
summoned
the
sinful
world
below
to
prayer
young
ladies
with
their
gallants
came
and
went
and
whenever
there
was
any
slacking
of
stragglers
up
the
hillside
the
bell
clamored
more
importunately
as
dusk
crept
on
torches
were
set
along
the
wall
of
the
terrace
and
as
we
went
down
the
hill
they
shone
on
the
red
and
blue
flags
and
the
white
belfry
and
illuminated
the
black
mass
of
overhanging
rock
with
a
red
glow
there
is
time
for
religion
in
places
here
and
it
is
rendered
picturesque
and
even
easy
and
enjoyable
by
the
aid
of
coffee
and
charming
scenery
when
we
reached
the
level
of
the
town
the
lights
still
glowed
high
up
in
the
recess
of
the
rocks
girls
were
laughing
and
chattering
as
they
stumbled
down
the
steep
and
the
wild
bell
still
rang
how
easy
it
is
to
be
good
in
greece
one
day
we
stole
a
march
on
marathon
and
shared
the
glory
of
those
who
say
they
have
seen
it
without
incurring
the
fatigue
of
a
journey
there
we
ascended
mt
pentelicus
hymettus
and
pentelicus
are
about
the
same
height
hundred
feet
the
latter
ten
miles
to
the
northeast
of
athens
commands
every
foot
of
the
attic
territory
if
one
should
sit
on
its
summit
and
read
a
history
of
the
little
state
he
would
need
no
map
we
were
away
at
half
past
five
in
the
morning
in
order
to
anticipate
if
possible
the
rising
of
the
daily
wind
as
we
ascended
we
had
on
our
left
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
village
of
kephisia
now
as
in
the
days
of
herodes
atticus
the
summer
resort
of
wealthy
athenians
who
find
in
its
fountains
the
sources
of
the
kephissus
and
in
its
groves
relief
from
the
heat
and
glare
of
the
scorched
athenian
plain
we
halted
at
a
monastery
left
our
carriage
and
the
ladies
mounted
horses
there
is
a
handsome
church
here
and
the
situation
is
picturesque
and
commands
a
wide
view
of
the
plain
and
the
rugged
north
slope
of
hymettus
but
i
could
not
learn
that
the
monastery
was
in
an
active
state
it
is
only
a
hive
of
drones
which
consumes
the
honey
produced
by
the
from
the
wild
thyme
of
the
neighboring
mountain
the
place
however
is
a
great
resort
of
parties
of
pleasure
who
picnic
under
the
grove
of
magnificent
and
once
a
year
the
king
and
queen
come
hither
to
see
the
youths
and
maidens
dance
on
the
greensward
up
to
the
highest
quarries
the
road
is
steep
and
strewn
with
broken
marble
and
after
that
there
is
an
hour
scramble
through
bushes
and
over
a
rocky
path
we
rested
in
a
large
grotto
near
the
principal
of
the
ancient
quarries
it
was
the
of
the
workmen
subsequently
a
christian
church
and
then
and
not
long
ago
a
haunt
and
home
of
brigands
here
we
found
a
party
of
four
fellows
half
clad
in
playing
cards
who
seemed
to
be
waiting
our
arrival
but
they
were
entirely
civil
and
i
presume
were
only
shepherds
whatever
they
may
have
been
formerly
from
these
quarries
was
hewn
the
marble
for
the
temple
of
theseus
the
parthenon
the
propylæa
the
theatres
and
other
public
buildings
to
which
age
has
now
given
a
soft
and
creamy
tone
the
pentelic
marble
must
have
been
too
brilliant
for
the
eye
and
its
dazzling
lustre
was
no
doubt
softened
by
the
judicious
use
of
color
fragments
which
we
broke
off
had
the
sparkle
and
crystalline
grain
of
and
if
they
were
placed
upon
the
table
one
would
unhesitatingly
take
them
to
sweeten
his
tea
the
whole
is
overgrown
with
laurel
and
we
found
all
the
way
to
the
summit
amid
the
rocks
of
the
higher
slopes
little
carrying
the
traditional
crooks
were
guarding
flocks
of
black
and
white
goats
and
invariably
as
we
passed
these
animals
scampered
off
and
perched
themselves
upon
sharp
rocks
in
a
photographic
pose
early
as
we
were
the
wind
had
risen
before
us
and
when
we
reached
the
bare
back
of
the
summit
it
blew
so
strongly
that
we
could
with
difficulty
keep
our
feet
and
gladly
took
refuge
in
a
sort
of
stone
corral
which
had
been
a
camp
and
lookout
of
brigands
from
this
commanding
point
they
spied
both
their
victims
and
pursuers
our
guide
went
into
the
details
of
the
capture
of
the
party
of
englishmen
who
spent
a
night
here
and
pointed
out
to
us
the
several
in
the
surrounding
country
to
which
they
were
successively
dragged
but
my
attention
was
not
upon
this
exploit
we
looked
almost
directly
down
upon
marathon
there
is
the
bay
and
the
curving
sandy
shore
where
the
persian
galleys
landed
here
upon
a
spur
jutting
out
from
the
hill
the
athenians
formed
before
they
encountered
the
host
in
the
plain
and
it
was
hidden
by
a
the
mound
where
the
one
hundred
and
athenian
dead
are
buried
it
is
only
a
small
field
perhaps
six
miles
along
the
shore
and
a
mile
and
a
half
deep
and
there
is
a
considerable
marsh
on
the
north
and
a
small
one
at
the
south
end
the
victory
at
so
little
cost
of
ten
thousand
over
a
hundred
thousand
is
partially
explained
by
the
nature
of
the
ground
the
persians
had
not
room
enough
to
manouvre
and
must
have
been
thrown
into
confusion
on
the
skirts
of
the
northern
swamp
and
if
over
six
thousand
of
them
were
slain
they
must
have
been
killed
on
the
shore
in
the
panic
of
their
embarkation
but
still
the
shore
is
broad
level
and
firm
and
the
greeks
must
have
been
convinced
that
the
gods
themselves
terrified
the
hearts
of
the
barbarians
and
enabled
them
to
discomfit
a
host
which
had
chosen
this
plain
as
the
most
feasible
in
all
attica
for
the
action
of
cavalry
a
lay
upon
the
strait
of
euripus
and
upon
euboea
and
nearly
hid
from
our
sight
the
forms
of
the
cyclades
but
away
in
the
northwest
were
snow
peaks
which
the
guide
said
were
the
heights
of
parnassus
above
delphi
in
the
world
there
can
be
few
prospects
so
magnificent
as
this
and
none
more
inspiring
to
the
imagination
no
one
can
properly
appreciate
the
greek
literature
or
art
who
has
not
looked
upon
the
greek
nature
which
seems
to
have
inspired
both
nothing
now
remains
of
the
monuments
and
temples
which
the
pride
and
piety
of
the
athenians
erected
upon
the
field
of
marathon
the
visitor
at
the
arsenal
of
venice
remembers
the
clumsy
lion
which
is
said
to
have
stood
on
this
plain
and
in
the
temple
of
theseus
at
athens
he
may
see
a
slab
which
was
found
in
this
meadow
on
it
is
cut
in
very
low
relief
the
figure
of
a
soldier
but
if
the
work
is
greek
the
style
of
treatment
is
assyrian
the
temple
of
theseus
which
occupies
an
elevation
above
the
city
and
west
of
the
areopagus
is
the
monument
of
grecian
antiquity
and
if
it
were
the
only
one
athens
would
still
be
worthy
of
a
pilgrimage
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
behind
it
is
a
level
esplanade
used
as
a
upon
one
side
of
which
have
been
gathered
some
relics
of
ancient
buildings
and
sculptures
seated
there
in
an
ancient
marble
chair
we
never
wearied
of
studying
the
beautiful
proportions
of
this
temple
which
scarcely
suffers
by
comparison
with
the
parthenon
or
that
at
pæstum
in
its
construction
the
same
subtle
secret
of
curved
lines
and
inclined
verticals
was
known
a
secret
which
increases
its
apparent
size
and
satisfies
the
eye
with
harmony
while
we
were
in
athens
the
antiquarians
were
excited
by
the
daily
discoveries
in
the
excavations
at
the
keramicus
the
field
where
the
athenian
potters
worked
through
the
portion
of
this
district
outside
the
gate
dipylum
ran
two
streets
which
were
lined
with
tombs
one
ran
to
the
academe
the
other
was
the
sacred
way
to
eleusis
the
excavations
have
disclosed
many
tombs
and
lovely
groups
of
funereal
sculpture
some
of
which
are
in
situ
but
many
have
been
removed
to
the
new
museum
the
favorite
device
is
the
seated
figure
of
the
one
about
to
die
who
in
this
position
of
dignity
takes
leave
of
those
most
loved
perhaps
it
is
a
wife
a
husband
a
lovely
daughter
a
handsome
boy
who
calmly
awaits
the
inevitable
moment
while
the
relatives
fondly
look
or
half
avert
their
sorrowful
faces
in
all
sculpture
i
know
nothing
so
touching
as
these
family
farewells
i
obtained
from
them
a
new
impression
of
the
greek
dignity
and
tenderness
of
the
simplicity
and
nobility
of
their
domestic
life
the
museum
which
was
unarranged
is
chiefly
one
of
fragments
but
what
i
saw
there
and
elsewhere
scattered
about
the
town
gave
me
a
finer
conception
of
the
spirit
of
the
ancient
art
than
all
the
more
perfect
remains
in
europe
put
together
and
it
seems
to
me
that
nowhere
except
in
athens
is
it
possible
to
attain
a
comprehension
of
its
depth
and
loveliness
something
i
know
is
due
to
the
genius
loci
but
you
come
to
the
knowledge
that
the
entire
life
even
the
commonest
was
pervaded
by
something
that
has
gone
from
modern
art
in
the
museum
we
saw
a
lovely
statue
of
isis
a
noble
one
of
patroclus
fine
ones
of
athletes
and
also
showing
the
intercourse
with
egypt
several
figures
holding
the
sacred
sistrum
and
one
of
rameses
ii
but
it
is
the
humbler
and
funereal
art
that
gives
one
a
new
conception
of
the
greek
grace
tenderness
and
sensibility
i
have
spoken
of
the
sweet
dignity
the
grace
that
accepted
death
with
lofty
resignation
and
yet
not
with
stoical
indifference
of
some
of
the
sepulchral
groups
there
was
even
more
poetry
in
some
that
are
simpler
upon
one
slab
was
carved
a
figure
pensive
alone
wrapping
his
drapery
about
him
and
stepping
into
the
silent
land
on
that
awful
journey
that
admits
of
no
companion
on
another
which
was
also
without
inscription
a
solitary
figure
sat
in
one
corner
he
had
removed
helmet
and
shield
and
placed
them
on
the
ground
behind
him
a
line
upon
the
stone
indicated
the
boundary
of
the
invisible
world
and
with
a
sad
contemplation
the
eyes
of
the
soldier
were
fixed
upon
that
unknown
region
into
which
he
was
about
to
descend
scarcely
a
day
passed
that
we
did
not
ascend
the
acropolis
and
again
and
again
we
traversed
the
areopagus
the
pnyx
the
museum
hills
from
the
valley
of
the
agora
stone
steps
lead
up
the
areopagus
to
a
bench
cut
in
the
rock
upon
this
open
summit
the
areopagite
council
held
in
the
open
air
its
solemn
sessions
here
it
sat
it
is
said
at
night
and
in
the
dark
that
no
face
of
witness
or
criminal
or
gesture
of
advocate
should
influence
the
justice
of
its
decisions
dedicated
to
divine
justice
it
was
the
most
sacred
and
awful
place
in
athens
in
a
cavern
underneath
it
was
the
sanctuary
of
the
dread
erinnyes
the
avenging
euries
whom
a
later
superstition
represented
with
snakes
twisted
in
their
hair
whatever
the
gay
frivolity
of
the
city
this
spot
was
silent
and
respected
as
the
dread
seat
of
judicature
of
the
highest
causes
of
religion
or
of
politics
to
us
mars
hill
is
chiefly
associated
with
the
name
of
paul
and
i
do
not
suppose
it
matters
much
whether
he
spoke
to
the
men
of
athens
in
this
sacred
place
or
as
is
more
probable
from
a
point
farther
down
the
hill
now
occupied
by
a
little
chapel
where
he
would
be
nearer
to
the
multitude
of
the
it
does
not
matter
it
was
on
the
areopagus
and
in
the
centre
of
temples
and
a
thousand
statues
that
bespoke
the
highest
civilization
of
the
pagan
world
that
paul
proclaimed
the
truth
which
man
egotism
continually
forgets
that
in
temples
made
with
hands
the
deity
does
not
dwell
from
this
height
on
the
side
of
the
museum
hill
we
see
the
grotto
that
has
been
dignified
with
the
title
of
the
of
socrates
but
upon
slight
grounds
when
the
philosopher
was
condemned
the
annual
sacred
ship
which
was
sent
with
to
delos
was
still
absent
and
until
its
return
no
execution
was
permitted
in
athens
every
day
the
soldiers
who
guarded
socrates
ascended
this
hill
and
went
round
the
point
to
see
if
the
expected
vessel
was
in
sight
and
it
is
for
their
convenience
that
some
antiquarian
designated
this
grotto
as
the
prison
the
delay
of
the
ship
gave
us
his
last
immortal
discourse
we
went
one
evening
by
the
temple
of
jupiter
along
the
ilissus
to
the
old
stadium
this
classic
stream
the
ilissus
is
a
gully
with
steep
banks
and
a
stony
bottom
and
apparently
never
wet
except
immediately
after
a
rain
you
would
think
by
the
flattery
it
received
from
the
ancient
athenians
that
it
was
larger
than
the
mississippi
the
panathenaic
stadium
as
it
is
called
because
its
chief
use
was
in
the
celebration
of
the
games
of
the
great
quadrennial
festival
was
by
nature
and
art
exceedingly
well
adapted
to
chariot
races
and
other
contests
open
at
the
end
where
a
bridge
crossed
the
ilissus
it
extended
a
hundred
feet
broad
six
hundred
and
fifty
feet
into
the
hill
upon
the
three
sloping
sides
of
which
in
seats
of
marble
could
be
accommodated
fifty
thousand
spectators
here
the
greek
youth
contended
for
the
prizes
in
the
chariot
race
and
the
more
barbarous
roman
emperors
amused
a
degenerate
people
with
the
sight
of
a
thousand
wild
beasts
hunted
and
slain
in
a
single
celebration
the
stadium
has
been
lately
and
at
the
time
of
our
visit
the
citizens
were
erecting
some
cheap
benches
at
one
end
and
preparing
in
a
feeble
way
for
what
it
pleases
them
to
call
the
olympic
games
which
were
to
be
inaugurated
the
following
sunday
the
place
must
inevitably
dwarf
the
performance
and
comparison
render
it
ridiculous
the
may
seem
to
themselves
olympic
heroes
and
they
had
the
earnest
air
of
trying
to
make
themselves
believe
that
they
were
really
reviving
the
ancient
glory
of
greece
or
that
they
could
bring
it
back
by
calling
a
and
the
wrestling
of
some
awkward
peasants
an
the
revival
could
be
as
we
afterwards
learned
it
was
only
a
sickly
and
laughable
affair
the
life
of
a
nation
is
only
preserved
in
progress
not
in
attempts
to
make
dead
forms
live
again
it
is
difficult
to
have
chariot
races
or
dramatic
contests
without
chariots
or
poets
and
i
suppose
the
modern
imitation
would
scarcely
be
saved
from
ludicrousness
even
if
the
herald
should
proclaim
that
now
a
patroclus
and
now
an
aristophanes
was
about
to
enter
the
arena
the
modern
occupants
of
athens
seem
to
be
deceiving
themselves
a
little
with
names
and
shadows
in
the
genuine
effort
to
revive
in
its
purity
the
greek
language
and
to
inspire
a
love
of
art
and
literature
the
western
traveller
will
wholly
sympathize
in
the
growth
of
a
liberal
commercial
spirit
he
will
see
still
more
hope
of
a
new
and
enduring
greek
state
but
a
puerile
imitation
of
a
society
and
a
religion
which
can
not
possibly
have
a
resurrection
excites
only
a
sad
smile
there
is
no
more
pitiful
sight
than
a
man
who
has
lost
his
ideals
unless
it
be
a
nation
which
has
lost
its
ideals
so
long
as
the
body
of
the
american
people
hold
fast
to
the
simple
and
primitive
conception
of
a
republican
society
the
ideals
of
a
century
ago
nation
can
survive
as
england
did
a
period
of
political
corruption
there
never
was
not
under
themistocles
nor
under
scanderbeg
a
more
glorious
struggle
for
independence
than
that
which
the
battle
of
navarino
virtually
terminated
the
world
had
a
right
to
expect
from
the
victors
a
new
and
vigorous
national
life
not
a
pale
and
sentimental
copy
of
a
splendid
original
which
is
now
as
impossible
of
revival
as
the
roman
empire
to
do
the
practical
and
greeks
justice
i
could
not
learn
that
they
took
a
deep
interest
in
the
nor
that
the
inhabitants
of
ancient
sparta
were
jealous
of
the
of
the
national
games
in
athens
since
they
say
there
are
no
longer
any
athenians
to
be
jealous
of
the
ancient
athenians
were
an
early
people
they
liked
the
dewy
freshness
of
the
morning
they
gave
the
first
hours
of
the
day
to
the
market
and
to
public
affairs
and
the
rising
sun
often
greeted
the
orators
on
the
bema
and
an
audience
on
the
terrace
below
we
had
seen
the
acropolis
in
almost
every
aspect
but
i
thought
that
one
might
perhaps
catch
more
of
its
ancient
spirit
at
sunrise
than
at
any
other
hour
it
is
four
when
my
companion
and
i
descend
into
the
silent
street
and
take
our
way
to
the
ancient
citadel
by
the
shortest
and
steepest
path
dawn
is
just
breaking
in
pink
and
the
is
in
the
sky
the
sleepy
guard
unbolts
the
gate
and
admits
us
but
does
not
care
to
follow
and
we
pass
the
propylæa
and
have
the
whole
field
to
ourselves
there
is
a
great
hush
as
we
come
into
the
silent
presence
of
the
gray
parthenon
the
shades
of
night
are
still
in
its
columns
we
take
our
station
on
a
broken
pillar
so
that
we
can
enjoy
a
view
of
the
east
front
as
the
light
strengthens
we
have
a
pink
sky
for
background
to
the
temple
and
the
smooth
bay
of
phalerum
is
like
a
piece
of
the
sky
dropped
down
very
gradually
the
light
breaks
on
the
parthenon
and
in
its
glowing
awakening
it
is
like
a
sentient
thing
throwing
shadows
from
its
columns
and
kindling
more
and
more
the
lion
gargoyles
on
the
corners
of
the
pediment
have
a
life
which
we
had
not
noticed
before
there
is
now
a
pink
tint
on
the
fragments
of
columns
lying
at
the
side
there
is
a
reddish
hue
on
the
plain
about
piræus
the
strait
of
salamis
is
green
but
growing
blue
phalerum
is
taking
an
iridescent
sheen
i
can
see
beyond
the
gulf
of
ægina
the
distant
height
of
the
city
is
still
in
heavy
shadow
even
the
temple
of
theseus
does
not
relax
from
its
sombreness
but
the
light
mounts
it
catches
the
top
of
the
white
columns
of
the
propylæa
it
shines
on
the
cornice
of
the
erechtheum
and
creeps
down
in
blushes
upon
the
faces
of
the
caryatides
which
seem
to
bow
yet
in
worship
of
the
pallas
athene
the
bugles
of
the
soldiers
called
to
drill
on
the
thesean
esplanade
float
up
to
us
they
are
really
summoning
the
statues
and
the
old
panathenaic
cavalcades
on
the
friezes
to
life
and
morning
action
the
day
advances
the
red
sun
commanding
the
hill
and
flooding
it
with
light
and
the
buildings
glowing
more
and
more
in
it
but
yet
casting
shadows
a
hawk
sweeps
around
from
the
north
and
hangs
poised
on
motionless
wings
over
the
building
just
as
the
sun
touches
it
we
climb
to
the
top
of
the
western
pediment
for
the
wide
sweep
of
view
the
world
has
already
got
wind
of
day
and
is
putting
off
its
nightcaps
and
opening
its
doors
as
we
descend
we
peer
about
for
a
bit
of
marble
as
a
memento
of
our
visit
but
lord
elgin
has
left
little
for
the
kleptomaniac
to
carry
away
at
this
hour
the
athenians
ought
to
be
assembling
on
the
pnyx
to
hear
demosthenes
who
should
be
already
on
the
bema
but
the
bema
has
no
orator
and
the
terrace
is
empty
we
might
perhaps
see
an
early
representation
at
the
theatre
of
dionysus
into
which
we
can
cast
a
stone
from
this
wall
we
pass
the
gate
scramble
along
the
ragged
hillside
of
the
excavators
on
the
acropolis
stand
above
the
highest
seats
of
the
amphitheatre
no
one
has
come
the
white
marble
chairs
in
the
front
with
the
names
of
the
priests
of
bacchus
and
reserved
for
and
even
the
seats
not
reserved
are
empty
there
is
no
chorus
manoeuvring
on
the
paved
orchestra
about
the
altar
the
stage
is
broken
in
and
the
crouching
figures
that
supported
it
are
the
only
sign
of
life
one
would
like
to
have
sat
upon
these
benches
that
look
on
the
sea
and
listened
to
a
chorus
from
the
antigone
this
morning
one
would
like
to
have
witnessed
that
scene
when
aristophanes
on
this
stage
mimicked
and
ridiculed
socrates
and
the
philosopher
rising
from
his
undistinguished
seat
high
up
among
the
people
replied
the
gulf
of
corinth
with
deep
reluctance
we
tore
ourselves
from
the
fascinations
of
athens
very
early
one
morning
after
these
things
says
the
guide
paul
departed
from
athens
and
came
to
corinth
our
departure
was
in
the
same
direction
we
had
no
choice
of
time
for
the
only
steamer
leaves
on
sunday
morning
and
besides
our
going
then
removed
us
from
the
temptation
of
the
olympic
games
at
half
past
five
we
were
on
board
the
little
greek
steamer
at
the
piraeus
we
sailed
along
salamis
it
was
a
morning
of
clouds
but
ægina
once
mistress
of
these
seas
and
the
hated
rival
of
athens
and
the
peloponnesus
were
robed
in
graceful
garments
that
like
the
veils
of
the
circassian
girls
did
not
conceal
their
forms
in
four
hours
we
landed
at
kalamaki
which
is
merely
a
station
for
the
transfer
of
passengers
across
the
isthmus
six
miles
south
on
the
coast
we
had
a
glimpse
of
cenchreæ
which
is
famous
as
the
place
where
paul
still
under
the
bonds
of
jewish
superstition
having
accomplished
his
vow
shaved
his
head
the
neck
of
limestone
rock
which
connects
the
peloponnesus
with
the
mainland
is
ten
miles
long
and
not
more
than
four
miles
broad
from
kalamaki
to
lutraki
on
the
gulf
of
corinth
and
as
it
is
not
at
its
highest
elevation
over
a
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
the
project
of
piercing
it
with
a
canal
which
was
often
entertained
and
actually
begun
by
nero
does
not
seem
preposterous
the
traveller
over
it
will
see
some
remains
of
the
line
of
fortification
the
isthmian
wall
which
served
in
turn
greeks
macedonians
saracens
latin
crusaders
and
slavonic
settlers
and
fragments
of
the
ancient
buildings
of
the
isthmian
sanctuary
where
the
panhellenic
festivals
were
celebrated
the
drive
across
was
exceedingly
pleasant
the
isthmus
is
seamed
with
ravines
and
ridges
picturesque
with
rocks
which
running
vines
drape
and
age
has
colored
and
variegated
with
we
enjoyed
on
either
hand
the
splendid
mountain
forms
on
the
north
white
helicon
and
parnassus
on
the
south
the
nearly
height
of
and
the
broken
snowy
hills
of
the
morea
familiar
as
we
were
with
the
atlas
we
had
not
until
now
any
adequate
conception
how
much
indented
the
grecian
mainland
and
islands
are
nor
how
broken
into
peaks
narrow
valleys
and
long
serrated
summits
are
the
contours
when
we
appreciate
by
actual
sight
the
multitude
of
islands
that
compose
greece
how
subject
to
tempests
its
seas
are
how
difficult
is
communication
between
the
villages
of
the
mainland
or
even
those
on
the
same
island
we
understand
the
naturalness
of
the
ancient
divisions
and
strifes
and
we
see
the
physical
obstacles
to
the
creation
of
a
feeling
of
unity
in
the
present
callow
kingdom
and
one
hears
with
no
surprise
that
corfu
wishes
herself
back
under
english
protection
we
drove
through
the
cluster
of
white
houses
on
the
bay
which
is
now
called
corinth
and
saw
at
three
miles
distance
the
site
of
the
old
city
and
the
acropolis
beyond
it
earthquakes
and
malaria
have
not
been
more
lenient
to
the
ancient
town
than
was
roman
vengeance
and
of
the
capital
which
was
to
greece
in
luxury
what
athens
was
in
wit
only
a
few
columns
and
sinking
walls
remain
even
the
voluptuousness
of
corinth
is
a
tale
of
two
thousand
years
ago
and
the
name
might
long
ago
have
sunk
with
the
fortunes
of
the
city
but
for
the
long
residence
there
of
a
poor
in
whom
no
proud
citizen
of
that
day
of
all
those
who
down
to
eat
and
drink
and
rose
up
to
play
would
have
recognized
the
chief
creator
of
its
fame
our
little
greek
steamer
was
crowded
excessively
and
mainly
with
greeks
going
to
patras
and
zante
who
noisily
talked
politics
and
business
in
a
manner
that
savored
more
of
new
england
than
of
the
land
of
solon
and
plato
for
the
first
time
in
a
travel
of
many
months
we
met
families
together
gentlemen
with
their
wives
and
children
and
saw
the
evidences
of
a
happy
it
is
everything
in
favor
of
the
greeks
that
they
have
preserved
the
idea
of
home
and
cherish
as
the
centre
of
all
good
and
strength
domestic
purity
at
dinner
there
was
an
undisguised
rush
for
seats
at
the
table
and
the
strongest
men
got
them
we
looked
down
through
the
skylights
and
beheld
the
valiant
greeks
flourishing
their
knives
attacking
while
expecting
soup
the
caviare
and
pickles
and
thrusting
the
naked
blades
into
their
mouths
without
fear
the
knife
seems
seldom
to
hurt
the
greek
whose
display
of
deadly
weapons
is
mainly
for
show
there
are
dozens
of
stout
swarthy
fellows
on
board
in
petticoats
and
quilted
leggings
with
each
a
belly
full
of
weapons
protruding
leathern
pouch
contains
a
couple
of
pistols
a
cartridges
and
pipes
and
tobacco
the
sail
through
the
gulf
of
corinth
is
one
to
be
enjoyed
and
remembered
but
the
reader
shall
not
be
wearied
with
a
catalogue
of
names
what
is
it
to
him
that
we
felt
the
presence
of
delphi
that
we
had
parnassus
on
our
right
and
mt
panachaicum
lifting
itself
higher
than
mt
washington
on
our
left
the
locrian
coast
on
one
side
and
the
range
of
arcadia
on
the
other
the
strait
narrowed
as
we
came
at
evening
near
patras
and
between
the
opposite
forts
of
rheum
and
antirheum
it
is
no
broader
than
the
bosphorus
it
was
already
dusky
when
we
peered
into
the
bay
of
lepanto
which
is
not
however
the
site
of
the
battle
of
that
name
in
which
the
natural
son
of
the
pretty
innkeeper
of
ratisbon
rendered
such
a
signal
service
to
christendom
patras
a
thriving
new
city
which
inherits
the
name
but
not
the
site
of
the
ancient
lies
open
in
the
narrow
strait
subject
to
the
high
wind
which
always
blows
through
the
passage
and
is
usually
a
dangerous
landing
all
the
time
that
we
lay
there
in
the
dark
we
thought
a
tempest
was
prevailing
but
the
clamor
subsided
when
we
moved
into
the
open
sea
of
patras
we
saw
nothing
except
a
circle
of
lights
on
the
shore
a
mile
long
a
procession
of
colored
torches
which
illumined
for
an
instant
the
façade
of
the
city
hall
and
some
rockets
which
went
up
in
honor
of
a
local
patriot
who
had
returned
on
our
boat
from
athens
and
we
had
not
even
a
glimpse
of
missolonghi
which
we
passed
in
the
night
at
daylight
we
are
at
zante
anchored
in
its
harbor
opposite
the
peloponnesian
coast
the
town
is
most
charmingly
situated
and
gives
one
an
impression
of
wealth
and
elegance
old
zacynthus
was
renowned
for
its
hospitality
before
the
days
of
the
athenian
and
spartan
wars
is
the
tenacity
with
which
traits
are
perpetuated
amid
a
thousand
present
wealthy
and
enterprising
whose
villas
are
scattered
about
the
slopes
enjoy
a
reputation
for
the
same
delightful
gift
the
gentlemen
are
distinguished
among
the
ionians
for
their
fondness
of
country
life
and
convivial
gayety
early
as
it
was
the
town
welcomed
us
with
its
most
gracious
offerings
of
flowers
and
fruit
for
the
pedlers
who
swarmed
on
board
brought
nothing
less
poetical
than
handfuls
of
dewy
roses
carnations
heliotrope
freshly
cut
mignonette
baskets
of
yellow
oranges
and
bottles
of
red
wine
the
wine
of
which
the
zante
passengers
had
boasted
was
very
good
and
the
oranges
solid
juicy
sweet
the
best
i
have
ever
eaten
except
perhaps
some
grown
in
a
fortunate
year
in
florida
sharp
hills
rise
behind
the
town
and
beyond
a
most
fertile
valley
broadens
out
to
the
sea
almost
all
the
land
is
given
up
to
the
culture
of
the
the
grapes
of
corinth
for
in
the
transfer
of
the
chief
cultivation
of
this
profitable
fruit
from
corinth
to
zante
the
name
went
with
the
dwarf
vines
on
the
hillsides
as
we
sailed
away
we
observed
innumerable
terraces
broad
flat
and
hard
like
and
learned
that
they
were
the
of
the
ripe
currants
we
were
all
day
among
the
ionian
islands
and
were
able
to
see
all
of
them
except
cythera
off
cape
malea
esteemed
for
its
honey
and
its
magnificent
temple
to
the
venus
they
lay
in
such
a
light
as
the
reader
of
homer
likes
to
think
of
them
we
sailed
past
them
as
in
a
dream
not
caring
to
distinguish
history
from
fable
it
was
off
the
little
echinades
near
the
coast
by
the
mouth
of
the
achelous
that
don
john
three
hundred
years
ago
broke
the
european
onset
of
the
ottoman
arms
it
was
nearly
a
dear
victory
for
christendom
for
among
the
severely
wounded
was
cervantes
and
don
quixote
had
not
yet
been
written
but
this
battle
is
not
more
real
to
us
than
the
story
of
ulysses
and
penelope
which
the
rocky
surface
of
ithaca
recalls
and
as
we
lingered
along
the
shores
of
cephalonia
and
leucadia
it
was
not
of
any
cæsar
or
byzantine
emperor
or
norman
chieftain
that
we
thought
but
of
the
poet
whose
verses
will
outlast
all
their
renown
leucadia
still
harbors
it
is
said
the
breed
of
wolves
that
perhaps
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
these
islands
preserve
in
purity
the
hellenic
blood
we
sailed
close
to
the
long
promontory
rock
of
woe
and
saw
if
any
one
may
see
the
very
precipice
from
which
sappho
leaping
quenched
in
brine
the
amatory
flames
of
a
heart
that
sixty
years
of
song
and
trouble
had
not
cooled
through
the
strait
of
actium
we
looked
upon
the
smooth
inland
sea
of
ambracia
while
our
steamer
churned
along
the
very
waters
that
saw
the
flight
of
the
purple
sails
of
cleopatra
whom
the
enamored
antony
followed
and
left
the
world
to
augustus
the
world
was
a
small
affair
then
when
its
possession
could
be
decided
on
a
bit
of
water
where
as
byron
says
two
frigates
could
hardly
manouvre
these
historical
empires
were
fleeting
shows
at
the
best
not
to
be
compared
to
the
permanent
conquests
and
empire
of
the
mind
the
voyager
from
the
bosphorus
to
corfu
feels
that
it
is
not
any
alexander
or
cæsar
chagan
or
caliph
but
homer
who
rules
over
the
innumerable
islands
and
sunny
mainlands
of
greece
it
was
deep
twilight
when
we
passed
the
barren
rock
of
and
the
mountain
in
the
sea
called
paxos
there
is
no
island
in
all
these
seas
that
has
not
its
legend
that
connected
with
paxos
and
recorded
by
plutarch
i
am
tempted
to
transcribe
from
the
handbook
in
the
quaint
language
in
which
it
is
quoted
for
it
expresses
not
only
the
spirit
of
this
wild
coast
but
also
our
own
passage
out
of
the
domain
of
mythology
into
the
sunlight
of
christian
countries
about
the
time
that
our
lord
suffered
his
most
bitter
passion
certain
persons
sailing
from
italy
to
cyprus
at
night
heard
a
voice
calling
aloud
thamus
thamus
who
giving
ear
to
the
cry
was
bidden
for
he
was
pilot
of
the
ship
when
he
came
near
to
pelodes
to
tell
that
the
great
god
pan
was
dead
which
he
doubting
to
do
yet
for
that
when
he
came
to
pelodes
there
was
such
a
calm
of
wind
that
the
ship
stood
still
in
the
sea
unmoored
he
was
forced
to
cry
aloud
that
pan
was
dead
wherewithal
there
were
such
piteous
outcries
and
dreadful
shrieking
as
hath
not
been
the
like
by
which
pan
of
some
is
understood
the
great
sathanas
whose
kingdom
was
at
that
time
by
christ
conquered
and
the
gates
of
hell
broken
up
for
at
that
time
all
oracles
surceased
and
enchanted
spirits
that
were
wont
to
delude
the
people
henceforth
held
their
it
was
ten
at
night
when
we
reached
corfu
and
sailed
in
under
the
starlight
by
the
frowning
hill
of
the
fortress
gliding
spectrally
among
the
shipping
with
steam
shut
off
and
at
a
signal
given
by
the
bowsman
letting
go
the
anchor
in
front
of
the
old
battery
corfu
in
the
opinion
of
napoleon
enjoys
the
most
beautiful
situation
in
the
world
its
loveliness
is
in
no
danger
of
being
overpraised
shut
in
by
the
albanian
coast
opposite
the
town
appears
to
lie
upon
a
lake
surrounded
by
the
noblest
hills
and
decorated
with
a
tropical
vegetation
very
picturesque
in
its
rock
is
the
old
double
fortress
which
the
english
in
surrendering
to
the
weak
greek
state
endeavored
to
render
as
weak
as
possible
it
and
a
part
of
the
town
occupy
a
bold
promontory
the
remainder
of
the
city
lies
around
a
little
bay
formed
by
this
promontory
and
quarantine
island
the
more
we
see
of
the
charming
situation
and
become
familiar
with
the
delicious
mountain
outlines
we
regret
that
we
can
tarry
but
a
day
and
almost
envy
those
who
make
it
a
winter
home
the
interior
of
the
city
itself
when
we
ascend
the
height
and
walk
in
the
palace
square
appears
bright
and
cheerful
but
retains
something
of
the
dull
and
decorous
aspect
of
an
english
garrison
town
in
the
shops
the
traveller
does
not
find
much
to
interest
him
except
the
high
prices
of
all
antiquities
we
drove
five
miles
into
the
country
to
the
conical
hill
and
garden
of
gasturi
whose
mistress
gathered
for
us
flowers
and
let
us
pluck
from
the
trees
the
ripe
and
rather
tasteless
nespoli
from
this
summit
is
an
extraordinary
prospect
of
blue
sea
mountains
snowy
summits
the
town
and
the
island
broken
into
sharp
peaks
and
most
luxuriant
valleys
and
hillsides
ancient
gnarled
abound
thousands
of
acres
of
grapevines
were
in
sight
the
hedges
were
the
cactus
and
groves
of
walnuts
and
most
vigorous
interspersed
the
landscape
there
was
even
here
and
there
a
palm
a
lovely
land
most
poetical
in
its
contours
the
italian
steamer
for
brindisi
was
crowded
with
passengers
on
the
forward
deck
was
a
picturesque
horde
of
albanian
gypsies
the
captain
said
that
he
counted
eighty
without
the
small
ones
which
to
avoid
the
payment
of
fare
were
done
up
in
handkerchiefs
and
carried
in
bags
like
kittens
the
men
in
broad
short
breeches
and
the
jackets
of
their
country
were
stout
and
fine
fellows
physically
the
women
wearing
no
marked
costume
but
clad
in
any
rags
of
dresses
that
may
have
been
begged
or
stolen
were
strikingly
wild
in
appearance
and
if
it
is
true
that
the
women
of
a
race
best
preserve
the
primeval
traits
these
preserve
in
their
swarthy
complexions
burning
black
eyes
and
jet
black
hair
the
characteristics
of
some
savage
oriental
tribe
the
hair
in
front
was
woven
into
big
braids
which
were
stiff
with
coins
and
other
barbarous
ornaments
in
silver
a
few
among
them
might
be
called
handsome
since
their
profiles
were
classic
but
it
was
a
wild
beauty
which
woman
sometimes
shares
with
the
panther
they
slept
about
the
deck
amidst
their
luggage
one
family
usually
crawling
into
a
single
sack
in
the
morning
there
were
nests
of
them
all
about
and
as
they
crawled
forth
especially
as
the
little
ones
swarmed
out
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
the
number
of
passengers
had
not
been
miraculously
increased
in
the
night
the
women
carry
the
fortune
of
the
family
on
their
heads
certainly
their
raiment
which
drapes
but
does
not
conceal
their
forms
would
scarcely
have
a
value
in
the
of
naples
i
bought
of
one
of
them
a
silver
ornament
cutting
it
from
the
hair
but
i
observed
that
her
husband
appropriated
the
money
it
was
like
entering
a
new
world
of
order
and
civilization
next
morning
to
sail
through
the
vast
outer
harbor
of
brindisi
into
the
inner
one
and
lie
for
the
first
time
in
the
mediterranean
at
a
dock
the
gypsies
made
a
more
picturesque
landing
than
the
other
passengers
trudging
away
with
their
hags
tags
rags
and
the
women
and
children
lugging
their
share
it
was
almost
touching
to
see
their
care
for
the
heaps
of
rubbish
which
constitute
all
their
worldly
possessions
they
come
like
locusts
to
plunder
sunny
italy
on
a
pretence
of
seeking
work
in
the
fields
they
will
spend
the
summer
in
the
open
air
gaining
health
and
living
as
their
betters
like
to
live
upon
the
labor
of
others
brindisi
has
a
beautiful
roman
column
near
it
the
house
where
virgil
is
said
to
have
died
and
an
ancient
fortress
which
is
half
crumbling
walls
and
half
and
is
surrounded
like
the
city
wall
by
a
moat
now
converted
into
a
vegetable
garden
as
i
was
peacefully
walking
along
the
rampart
intending
to
surround
the
town
a
soldier
motioned
me
back
as
if
it
had
been
time
of
war
i
offered
to
stroll
over
the
drawbridge
into
the
mouldy
fortress
a
soldier
objected
as
i
turned
away
he
changed
his
mind
and
offered
to
show
me
the
interior
but
it
was
now
my
turn
to
decline
and
i
told
him
that
the
idle
impulse
passed
i
would
rather
not
go
in
of
all
human
works
i
care
the
least
for
fortresses
except
to
look
at
from
the
outside
it
is
not
worth
while
to
enter
one
except
by
storming
it
or
strolling
in
and
when
one
must
ask
permission
the
charm
is
gone
you
get
sick
to
death
almost
of
these
who
start
up
and
bar
your
way
with
a
bayonet
wherever
you
seek
to
walk
in
europe
no
soldier
i
like
the
view
from
the
wall
of
the
moat
and
the
great
fields
of
ripe
wheat
waving
in
the
sweet
but
i
do
care
for
you
or
your
fortress
brindisi
is
clean
but
dull
yet
it
was
characteristically
italian
that
i
should
encounter
in
the
duomo
square
a
smart
charlatan
who
sold
gold
chains
at
a
franc
each
did
not
seem
to
be
dear
and
a
jolly
almost
hilarious
cripple
who
having
no
use
of
his
shrunken
legs
had
mounted
himself
on
a
wooden
bottom
like
a
and
by
the
aid
of
his
hands
went
about
as
lively
as
a
centipede
i
stepped
into
the
cathedral
a
service
was
droning
on
with
few
listeners
on
one
side
of
the
altar
was
a
hideous
soiled
wax
image
of
the
dead
christ
over
the
altar
in
the
central
place
of
worship
was
a
flaring
figure
of
the
virgin
clad
in
the
latest
mode
of
french
millinery
and
underneath
it
was
the
legend
viva
maria
this
was
the
salutation
of
our
return
to
a
christian
land
christ
is
dead
the
virgin
lives
here
our
journey
which
began
on
the
other
coast
of
italy
in
november
ends
in
june
in
ascending
the
nile
to
the
second
cataract
and
making
the
circuit
of
the
levant
we
have
seen
a
considerable
portion
of
the
moslem
empire
and
of
the
nascent
greek
kingdom
which
aspires
at
least
in
europe
to
displace
it
we
have
seen
both
in
a
transition
period
as
marked
as
any
since
the
saracens
trampled
out
the
last
remnants
of
the
always
sickly
greek
empire
the
prospect
is
hopeful
although
the
picture
of
social
and
political
life
is
far
from
agreeble
but
for
myself
now
that
we
are
out
of
the
orient
and
away
from
all
its
squalor
and
cheap
magnificence
i
turn
again
to
it
with
a
longing
which
i
can
not
explain
it
is
still
the
land
of
the
imagination
