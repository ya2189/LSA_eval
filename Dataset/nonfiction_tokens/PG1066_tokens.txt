preface
this
small
volume
written
as
the
first
of
a
series
is
meant
to
fill
quite
another
place
from
the
history
of
the
norman
by
the
same
author
that
was
a
narrative
of
events
reaching
over
a
considerable
time
this
is
the
portrait
of
a
man
in
his
personal
character
a
man
whose
life
takes
up
only
a
part
of
the
time
treated
of
in
the
other
work
we
have
now
to
look
on
william
as
one
who
though
stranger
and
conqueror
is
yet
worthily
entitled
to
a
place
on
the
list
of
english
statesmen
there
is
perhaps
no
man
before
or
after
him
whose
personal
character
and
personal
will
have
had
so
direct
an
effect
on
the
course
which
the
laws
and
constitution
of
england
have
taken
since
his
time
norman
as
a
conqueror
as
a
statesman
he
is
english
and
on
this
side
of
him
at
least
he
worthily
begins

introduction
the
history
of
england
like
the
land
and
its
people
has
been
specially
insular
and
yet
no
land
has
undergone
deeper
influences
from
without
no
land
has
owed
more
than
england
to
the
personal
action
of
men
not
of
native
birth
britain
was
truly
called
another
world
in
opposition
to
the
world
of
the
european
mainland
the
world
of
rome
in
every
age
the
history
of
britain
is
the
history
of
an
island
of
an
island
great
enough
to
form
a
world
of
itself
in
speaking
of
celts
or
teutons
in
britain
we
are
speaking
not
simply
of
celts
and
teutons
but
of
celts
and
teutons
parted
from
their
kinsfolk
on
the
mainland
and
brought
under
the
common
influences
of
an
island
world
the
land
has
seen
several
settlements
from
outside
but
the
settlers
have
always
been
brought
under
the
spell
of
their
insular
position
whenever
settlement
has
not
meant
displacement
the
new
comers
have
been
assimilated
by
the
existing
people
of
the
land
when
it
has
meant
displacement
they
have
still
become
islanders
marked
off
from
those
whom
they
left
behind
by
characteristics
which
were
the
direct
result
of
settlement
in
an
island
world
the
history
of
britain
then
and
specially
the
history
of
england
has
been
largely
a
history
of
elements
absorbed
and
assimilated
from
without
but
each
of
those
elements
has
done
somewhat
to
modify
the
mass
into
which
it
was
absorbed
the
english
land
and
nation
are
not
as
they
might
have
been
if
they
had
never
in
later
times
absorbed
the
fleming
the
french
huguenot
the
german
palatine
still
less
are
they
as
they
might
have
been
if
they
had
not
in
earlier
times
absorbed
the
greater
elements
of
the
dane
and
the
norman
both
were
assimilated
but
both
modified
the
character
and
destiny
of
the
people
into
whose
substance
they
were
absorbed
the
conquerors
from
normandy
were
silently
and
peacefully
lost
in
the
greater
mass
of
the
english
people
still
we
can
never
be
as
if
the
norman
had
never
come
among
us
we
ever
bear
about
us
the
signs
of
his
presence
our
colonists
have
carried
those
signs
with
them
into
distant
lands
to
remind
men
that
settlers
in
america
and
australia
came
from
a
land
which
the
norman
once
entered
as
a
conqueror
but
that
those
signs
of
his
presence
hold
the
place
which
they
do
hold
in
our
mixed
political
being
that
badges
of
conquest
as
they
are
no
one
feels
them
to
be
badges
of
this
comes
of
the
fact
that
if
the
norman
came
as
a
conqueror
he
came
as
a
conqueror
of
a
special
perhaps
almost
of
an
unique
kind
the
norman
conquest
of
england
has
in
its
nature
and
in
its
results
no
exact
parallel
in
history
and
that
it
has
no
exact
parallel
in
history
is
largely
owing
to
the
character
and
position
of
the
man
who
wrought
it
that
the
history
of
england
for
the
last
eight
hundred
years
has
been
what
it
has
been
has
largely
come
of
the
personal
character
of
a
single
man
that
we
are
what
we
are
to
this
day
largely
comes
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
moment
when
our
national
destiny
might
be
said
to
hang
on
the
will
of
a
single
man
and
that
that
man
was
william
surnamed
at
different
stages
of
his
life
and
memory
the
bastard
the
conqueror
and
the
great
with
perfect
fitness
then
does
william
the
norman
william
the
norman
conqueror
of
england
take
his
place
in
a
series
of
english
statesmen
that
so
it
should
be
is
characteristic
of
english
history
our
history
has
been
largely
wrought
for
us
by
men
who
have
come
in
from
without
sometimes
as
conquerors
sometimes
as
the
opposite
of
conquerors
but
in
whatever
character
they
came
they
had
to
put
on
the
character
of
englishmen
and
to
make
their
work
an
english
work
from
whatever
land
they
came
on
whatever
mission
they
came
as
statesmen
they
were
english
william
the
greatest
of
his
class
is
still
but
a
member
of
a
class
along
with
him
we
must
reckon
a
crowd
of
kings
bishops
and
high
officials
in
many
ages
of
our
history
theodore
of
tarsus
and
cnut
of
denmark
lanfranc
of
pavia
and
anselm
of
aosta
randolf
flambard
and
roger
of
salisbury
henry
of
anjou
and
simon
of
montfort
are
all
written
on
a
list
of
which
william
is
but
the
foremost
the
largest
number
come
in
own
generation
and
in
the
generations
just
before
and
after
it
but
the
breed
of
adopted
children
and
rulers
never
died
out
the
name
of
william
the
deliverer
stands
if
not
beside
that
of
his
namesake
the
conqueror
yet
surely
alongside
of
the
lawgiver
from
anjou
and
we
count
among
the
later
worthies
of
england
not
a
few
men
sprung
from
other
lands
who
did
and
are
doing
their
work
among
us
and
who
as
statesmen
at
least
must
count
as
english
as
we
look
along
the
whole
line
even
among
the
conquering
kings
and
their
immediate
instruments
their
work
never
takes
the
shape
of
the
rooting
up
of
the
earlier
institutions
of
the
land
those
institutions
are
modified
sometimes
silently
by
the
mere
growth
of
events
sometimes
formally
and
of
set
purpose
old
institutions
get
new
names
new
institutions
are
set
up
alongside
of
them
but
the
old
ones
are
never
swept
away
they
sometimes
die
out
they
are
never
abolished
this
comes
largely
of
the
absorbing
and
assimilating
power
of
the
island
world
but
it
comes
no
less
of
personal
character
and
personal
circumstances
and
of
the
personal
character
of
the
norman
conqueror
and
of
the
circumstances
in
which
he
found
himself
our
special
business
now
is
with
the
personal
acts
and
character
of
william
and
above
all
with
his
acts
and
character
as
an
english
statesman
but
the
english
reign
of
william
followed
on
his
earlier
norman
reign
and
its
character
was
largely
the
result
of
his
earlier
norman
reign
a
man
of
the
highest
natural
gifts
he
had
gone
through
such
a
schooling
from
his
childhood
upwards
as
falls
to
the
lot
of
few
princes
before
he
undertook
the
conquest
of
england
he
had
in
some
sort
to
work
the
conquest
of
normandy
of
the
ordinary
work
of
a
sovereign
in
a
warlike
age
the
defence
of
his
own
land
the
annexation
of
other
lands
william
had
his
full
share
with
the
land
of
his
overlord
he
had
dealings
of
the
most
opposite
kinds
he
had
to
call
in
the
help
of
the
french
king
to
put
down
rebellion
in
the
norman
duchy
and
he
had
to
drive
back
more
than
one
invasion
of
the
french
king
at
the
head
of
an
united
norman
people
he
added
domfront
and
maine
to
his
dominions
and
the
conquest
of
maine
the
work
as
much
of
statesmanship
as
of
warfare
was
the
rehearsal
of
the
conquest
of
england
there
under
circumstances
strangely
like
those
of
england
he
learned
his
trade
as
conqueror
he
learned
to
practise
on
a
narrower
field
the
same
arts
which
he
afterwards
practised
on
a
wider
but
after
all
own
duchy
was
his
special
school
it
was
his
life
in
his
own
duchy
which
specially
helped
to
make
him
what
he
was
surrounded
by
trials
and
difficulties
almost
from
his
cradle
he
early
learned
the
art
of
enduring
trials
and
overcoming
difficulties
he
learned
how
to
deal
with
men
he
learned
when
to
smite
and
when
to
spare
and
it
is
not
a
little
to
his
honour
that
in
the
long
course
of
such
a
reign
as
his
he
almost
always
showed
himself
far
more
ready
to
spare
than
to
smite
before
then
we
can
look
at
william
as
an
english
statesman
we
must
first
look
on
him
in
the
land
in
which
he
learned
the
art
of
statesmanship
we
must
see
how
one
who
started
with
all
the
disadvantages
which
are
implied
in
his
earlier
surname
of
the
bastard
came
to
win
and
to
deserve
his
later
surnames
of
the
conqueror
and
the
great
chapter
ii
the
early
years
of
william
if
early
reign
in
normandy
was
his
time
of
schooling
for
his
later
reign
in
england
his
school
was
a
stern
one
and
his
schooling
began
early
his
nominal
reign
began
at
the
age
of
seven
years
and
his
personal
influence
on
events
began
long
before
he
had
reached
the
usual
years
of
discretion
and
the
events
of
his
minority
might
well
harden
him
while
they
could
not
corrupt
him
in
the
way
in
which
so
many
princes
have
been
corrupted
his
whole
position
political
and
personal
could
not
fail
to
have
its
effect
in
forming
the
man
he
was
duke
of
the
normans
sixth
in
succession
from
rolf
the
founder
of
the
norman
state
at
the
time
of
his
accession
rather
more
than
a
hundred
and
ten
years
had
passed
since
plunderers
occasionally
settlers
from
scandinavia
had
changed
into
acknowledged
members
of
the
western
or
karolingian
kingdom
the
northmen
changed
name
and
thing
into
were
now
in
all
things
members
of
the
christian
and
world
but
french
as
the
normans
of
day
had
become
their
relation
to
the
kings
and
people
of
france
was
not
a
friendly
one
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
of
rolf
the
western
kingdom
of
the
franks
had
not
yet
finally
passed
to
the
at
paris
rolf
became
the
man
of
the
karolingian
king
at
laon
france
and
normandy
were
two
great
duchies
each
owning
a
precarious
supremacy
in
the
king
of
the
on
the
one
hand
normandy
had
been
called
into
being
by
a
frightful
dismemberment
of
the
french
duchy
from
which
the
original
norman
settlement
had
been
cut
off
france
had
lost
in
rouen
one
of
her
greatest
cities
and
she
was
cut
off
from
the
sea
and
from
the
lower
course
of
her
own
river
on
the
other
hand
the
french
and
the
norman
dukes
had
found
their
interest
in
a
close
alliance
norman
support
had
done
much
to
transfer
the
crown
from
laon
to
paris
and
to
make
the
and
the
the
same
person
it
was
the
adoption
of
the
french
speech
and
manners
by
the
normans
and
their
steady
alliance
with
the
french
dukes
which
finally
determined
that
the
ruling
element
in
gaul
should
be
romance
and
not
teutonic
and
that
of
its
romance
elements
it
should
be
french
and
not
aquitanian
if
the
creation
of
normandy
had
done
much
to
weaken
france
as
a
duchy
it
had
done
not
a
little
towards
the
making
of
france
as
a
kingdom
laon
and
its
crown
the
undefined
influence
that
went
with
the
crown
the
prospect
of
future
advance
to
the
south
had
been
bought
by
the
loss
of
rouen
and
of
the
mouth
of
the
seine
there
was
much
therefore
at
the
time
of
accession
to
keep
the
french
kings
and
the
norman
dukes
on
friendly
terms
the
old
alliance
had
been
strengthened
by
recent
good
offices
the
reigning
king
henry
the
first
owed
his
crown
to
the
help
of
father
robert
on
the
other
hand
the
original
ground
of
the
alliance
mutual
support
against
the
karolingian
king
had
passed
away
a
king
of
the
french
reigning
at
paris
was
more
likely
to
remember
what
the
normans
had
cost
him
as
duke
than
what
they
had
done
for
him
as
king
and
the
alliance
was
only
an
alliance
of
princes
the
mutual
dislike
between
the
people
of
the
two
countries
was
strong
the
normans
had
learned
french
ways
but
french
and
normans
had
not
become
countrymen
and
as
the
fame
of
normandy
grew
jealousy
was
doubtless
mingled
with
dislike
william
in
short
inherited
a
very
doubtful
and
dangerous
state
of
relations
towards
the
king
who
was
at
once
his
chief
neighbour
and
his
overlord
more
doubtful
and
dangerous
still
were
the
relations
which
the
young
duke
inherited
towards
the
people
of
his
own
duchy
and
the
kinsfolk
of
his
own
house
william
was
not
as
yet
the
great
or
the
conqueror
but
he
was
the
bastard
from
the
beginning
there
was
then
no
generally
received
doctrine
as
to
the
succession
to
kingdoms
and
duchies
everywhere
a
single
kingly
or
princely
house
supplied
as
a
rule
candidates
for
the
succession
everywhere
even
where
the
elective
doctrine
was
strong
a
son
was
always
likely
to
succeed
his
father
the
growth
of
feudal
notions
too
had
greatly
strengthened
the
hereditary
principle
still
no
rule
had
anywhere
been
laid
down
for
cases
where
the
late
prince
had
not
left
a
son
the
question
as
to
legitimate
birth
was
equally
unsettled
irregular
unions
of
all
kinds
though
condemned
by
the
church
were
tolerated
in
practice
and
were
nowhere
more
common
than
among
the
norman
dukes
in
truth
the
feeling
of
the
kingliness
of
the
stock
the
doctrine
that
the
king
should
be
the
son
of
a
king
is
better
satisfied
by
the
succession
of
the
late
bastard
son
than
by
sending
for
some
distant
kinsman
claiming
perhaps
only
through
females
still
bastardy
if
it
was
often
convenient
to
forget
it
could
always
be
turned
against
a
man
the
succession
of
a
bastard
was
never
likely
to
be
quite
undisputed
or
his
reign
to
be
quite
undisturbed
now
william
succeeded
to
his
duchy
under
the
double
disadvantage
of
being
at
once
bastard
and
minor
he
was
born
at
falaise
in
or
being
the
son
of
robert
afterwards
duke
but
then
only
count
of
hiesmois
by
herleva
commonly
called
arletta
the
daughter
of
fulbert
the
tanner
there
was
no
pretence
of
marriage
between
his
parents
yet
his
father
when
he
designed
william
to
succeed
him
might
have
made
him
legitimate
as
some
of
his
predecessors
had
been
made
by
a
marriage
with
his
mother
in
robert
succeeded
his
brother
richard
in
the
duchy
in
or
he
determined
to
go
on
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
he
called
on
his
barons
to
swear
allegiance
to
his
bastard
of
seven
years
old
as
his
successor
in
case
he
never
came
back
their
wise
counsel
to
stay
at
home
to
look
after
his
dominions
and
to
raise
up
lawful
heirs
was
unheeded
robert
carried
his
point
the
succession
of
young
william
was
accepted
by
the
norman
nobles
and
was
confirmed
by
the
overlord
henry
king
of
the
french
the
arrangement
soon
took
effect
robert
died
on
his
way
back
before
the
year
was
out
and
his
son
began
in
name
at
least
his
reign
of
years
over
the
norman
duchy
the
succession
of
one
who
was
at
once
bastard
and
minor
could
happen
only
when
no
one
else
had
a
distinctly
better
claim
william
could
never
have
held
his
ground
for
a
moment
against
a
brother
of
his
father
of
full
age
and
undoubted
legitimacy
but
among
the
living
descendants
of
former
dukes
some
were
themselves
of
doubtful
legitimacy
some
were
shut
out
by
their
profession
as
churchmen
some
claimed
only
through
females
robert
had
indeed
two
but
they
were
young
and
their
legitimacy
was
disputed
he
had
an
uncle
robert
archbishop
of
rouen
who
had
been
legitimated
by
the
later
marriage
of
his
parents
the
rival
who
in
the
end
gave
william
most
trouble
was
his
cousin
guy
of
burgundy
son
of
a
daughter
of
his
grandfather
richard
the
good
though
succession
was
not
liked
no
one
of
these
candidates
was
generally
preferred
to
him
he
therefore
succeeded
but
the
first
twelve
years
of
his
reign
were
spent
in
the
revolts
and
conspiracies
of
unruly
nobles
who
hated
the
young
duke
as
the
one
representative
of
law
and
order
and
who
were
not
eager
to
set
any
one
in
his
place
who
might
be
better
able
to
enforce
them
nobility
so
variously
defined
in
different
lands
in
normandy
took
in
two
classes
of
men
all
were
noble
who
had
any
kindred
or
affinity
legitimate
or
otherwise
with
the
ducal
house
the
natural
children
of
richard
the
fearless
were
legitimated
by
his
marriage
with
their
mother
gunnor
and
many
of
the
great
houses
of
normandy
sprang
from
her
brothers
and
sisters
the
mother
of
william
received
no
such
exaltation
as
this
besides
her
son
she
had
borne
to
robert
a
daughter
adelaide
and
after
death
she
married
a
norman
knight
named
herlwin
of
conteville
to
him
besides
a
daughter
she
bore
two
sons
ode
and
robert
they
rose
to
high
posts
in
church
and
state
and
played
an
important
part
in
their
history
besides
men
whose
nobility
was
of
this
kind
there
were
also
norman
houses
whose
privileges
were
older
than
the
amours
or
marriages
of
any
duke
houses
whose
greatness
was
as
old
as
the
settlement
of
rolf
as
old
that
is
as
the
ducal
power
itself
the
great
men
of
both
these
classes
were
alike
hard
to
control
a
norman
baron
of
this
age
was
well
employed
when
he
was
merely
rebelling
against
his
prince
or
waging
private
war
against
a
fellow
baron
what
specially
marks
the
time
is
the
frequency
of
treacherous
murders
wrought
by
men
of
the
highest
rank
often
on
harmless
neighbours
or
unsuspecting
guests
but
victims
were
also
found
among
those
guardians
of
the
young
duke
whose
faithful
discharge
of
their
duties
shows
that
the
norman
nobility
was
not
wholly
corrupt
one
indeed
was
a
foreign
prince
alan
count
of
the
bretons
a
grandson
of
richard
the
fearless
through
a
daughter
two
others
the
seneschal
osbern
and
gilbert
count
of
eu
were
irregular
kinsmen
of
the
duke
all
these
were
murdered
the
breton
count
by
poison
such
a
childhood
as
this
made
william
play
the
man
while
he
was
still
a
child
the
helpless
boy
had
to
seek
for
support
of
some
kind
he
got
together
the
chief
men
of
his
duchy
and
took
a
new
guardian
by
their
advice
but
it
marks
the
state
of
things
that
the
new
guardian
was
one
of
the
murderers
of
those
whom
he
succeeded
this
was
ralph
of
wacey
son
of
archbishop
robert
murderer
as
he
was
he
seems
to
have
discharged
his
duty
faithfully
there
are
men
who
are
careless
of
general
moral
obligations
but
who
will
strictly
carry
out
any
charge
which
appeals
to
personal
honour
anyhow
guardianship
brought
with
it
a
certain
amount
of
calm
but
men
high
in
the
young
favour
were
still
plotting
against
him
and
they
presently
began
to
plot
not
only
against
their
prince
but
against
their
country
the
disaffected
nobles
of
normandy
sought
for
a
helper
against
young
william
in
his
lord
king
henry
of
paris
the
art
of
diplomacy
had
never
altogether
slumbered
since
much
earlier
times
the
king
who
owed
his
crown
to
father
and
who
could
have
no
ground
of
offence
against
william
himself
easily
found
good
pretexts
for
meddling
in
norman
affairs
it
was
not
unnatural
in
the
king
of
the
french
to
wish
to
win
back
a
which
had
been
given
up
more
than
a
hundred
years
before
to
an
alien
power
even
though
that
power
had
for
much
more
than
half
of
that
time
acted
more
than
a
friendly
part
towards
france
it
was
not
unnatural
that
the
french
people
should
cherish
a
strong
national
dislike
to
the
normans
and
a
strong
wish
that
rouen
should
again
be
a
french
city
but
such
motives
were
not
openly
avowed
then
any
more
than
now
the
alleged
ground
was
quite
different
the
counts
of
chartres
were
troublesome
neighbours
to
the
duchy
and
the
castle
of
tillières
had
been
built
as
a
defence
against
them
an
advance
of
the
dominions
had
made
tillières
a
neighbour
of
france
and
as
a
neighbour
it
was
said
to
be
a
standing
menace
the
king
of
the
french
acting
in
concert
with
the
disaffected
party
in
normandy
was
a
dangerous
enemy
and
the
young
duke
and
his
counsellors
determined
to
give
up
tillières
now
comes
the
first
distinct
exercise
of
personal
will
we
are
without
exact
dates
but
the
time
can
be
hardly
later
than
when
william
was
from
twelve
to
thirteen
years
old
at
his
special
request
the
defender
of
tillières
gilbert
crispin
who
at
first
held
out
against
french
and
normans
alike
gave
up
the
castle
to
henry
the
castle
was
burned
the
king
promised
not
to
repair
it
for
four
years
yet
he
is
said
to
have
entered
normandy
to
have
laid
waste
native
district
of
hiesmois
to
have
supplied
a
french
garrison
to
a
norman
rebel
named
thurstan
who
held
the
castle
of
falaise
against
the
duke
and
to
have
ended
by
restoring
tillières
as
a
menace
against
normandy
and
now
the
boy
whose
destiny
had
made
him
so
early
a
leader
of
men
had
to
bear
his
first
arms
against
the
fortress
which
looked
down
on
his
thurstan
surrendered
and
went
into
banishment
william
could
set
down
his
own
falaise
as
the
first
of
a
long
list
of
towns
and
castles
which
he
knew
how
to
win
without
shedding
of
blood
when
we
next
see
distinct
personal
action
he
is
still
young
but
no
longer
a
child
or
even
a
boy
at
nineteen
or
thereabouts
he
is
a
wise
and
valiant
man
and
his
valour
and
wisdom
are
tried
to
the
uttermost
a
few
years
of
comparative
quiet
were
chiefly
occupied
as
a
quiet
time
in
those
days
commonly
was
with
ecclesiastical
affairs
one
of
these
specially
illustrates
the
state
of
things
with
which
william
had
to
deal
in
when
the
duke
was
about
fourteen
normandy
adopted
the
truce
of
god
in
its
later
shape
it
no
longer
attempted
to
establish
universal
peace
it
satisfied
itself
with
forbidding
under
the
strongest
ecclesiastical
censures
all
private
war
and
violence
of
any
kind
on
certain
days
of
the
week
legislation
of
this
kind
has
two
sides
it
was
an
immediate
gain
if
peace
was
really
enforced
for
four
days
in
the
week
but
that
which
was
not
forbidden
on
the
other
three
could
no
longer
be
denounced
as
in
itself
evil
we
are
told
that
in
no
land
was
the
truce
more
strictly
observed
than
in
normandy
but
we
may
be
sure
that
when
william
was
in
the
fulness
of
his
power
the
stern
weight
of
the
ducal
arm
was
exerted
to
enforce
peace
on
mondays
and
tuesdays
as
well
as
on
thursdays
and
fridays
it
was
in
the
year
that
authority
was
most
dangerously
threatened
and
that
he
was
first
called
on
to
show
in
all
their
fulness
the
powers
that
were
in
him
he
who
was
to
be
conqueror
of
maine
and
conqueror
of
england
was
first
to
be
conqueror
of
his
own
duchy
the
revolt
of
a
large
part
of
the
country
contrasted
with
the
firm
loyalty
of
another
part
throws
a
most
instructive
light
on
the
internal
state
of
the
duchy
there
was
as
there
still
is
a
line
of
severance
between
the
districts
which
formed
the
first
grant
to
rolf
and
those
which
were
afterwards
added
in
these
last
a
lingering
remnant
of
old
teutonic
life
had
been
called
into
fresh
strength
by
new
settlements
from
scandinavia
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
richard
the
fearless
rouen
the
city
is
emphatically
contrasted
with
bayeux
the
once
saxon
city
and
land
now
the
headquarters
of
the
danish
speech
at
that
stage
the
danish
party
was
distinctly
a
heathen
party
we
are
not
told
whether
danish
was
still
spoken
so
late
as
the
time
of
youth
we
can
hardly
believe
that
the
scandinavian
gods
still
kept
any
avowed
worshippers
but
the
geographical
limits
of
the
revolt
exactly
fall
in
with
the
boundary
which
had
once
divided
french
and
danish
speech
christian
and
heathen
worship
there
was
a
wide
difference
in
feeling
on
the
two
sides
of
the
dive
the
older
norman
settlements
now
thoroughly
french
in
tongue
and
manners
stuck
faithfully
to
the
duke
the
lands
to
the
west
rose
against
him
rouen
and
evreux
were
firmly
loyal
to
william
saxon
bayeux
and
danish
coutances
were
the
headquarters
of
his
enemies
when
the
geographical
division
took
this
shape
we
are
surprised
at
the
candidate
for
the
duchy
who
was
put
forward
by
the
rebels
william
was
a
norman
born
and
bred
his
rival
was
in
every
sense
a
frenchman
this
was
cousin
guy
of
burgundy
whose
connexion
with
the
ducal
house
was
only
by
the
but
his
descent
was
of
uncontested
legitimacy
which
gave
him
an
excuse
for
claiming
the
duchy
in
opposition
to
the
bastard
grandson
of
the
tanner
by
william
he
had
been
enriched
with
great
possessions
among
which
was
the
island
fortress
of
brionne
in
the
risle
the
real
object
of
the
revolt
was
the
partition
of
the
duchy
william
was
to
be
dispossessed
guy
was
to
be
duke
in
the
lands
east
of
dive
the
great
lords
of
western
normandy
were
to
be
left
independent
to
this
end
the
lords
of
the
bessin
and
the
côtentin
revolted
their
leader
being
neal
viscount
of
in
the
côtentin
we
are
told
that
the
mass
of
the
people
everywhere
wished
well
to
their
duke
in
the
common
sovereign
lay
their
only
chance
of
protection
against
their
immediate
lords
but
the
lords
had
armed
force
of
the
land
at
their
bidding
they
first
tried
to
slay
or
seize
the
duke
himself
who
chanced
to
be
in
the
midst
of
them
at
valognes
he
escaped
we
hear
a
stirring
tale
of
his
headlong
ride
from
valognes
to
falaise
safe
among
his
own
people
he
planned
his
course
of
action
he
first
sought
help
of
the
man
who
could
give
him
most
help
but
who
had
most
wronged
him
he
went
into
france
he
saw
king
henry
at
poissy
and
the
king
engaged
to
bring
a
french
force
to
help
under
his
own
command
this
time
henry
kept
his
promise
the
dismemberment
of
normandy
might
have
been
profitable
to
france
by
weakening
the
power
which
had
become
so
special
an
object
of
french
jealousy
but
with
a
king
the
common
interest
of
princes
against
rebellious
barons
came
first
henry
came
with
a
french
army
and
fought
well
for
his
ally
on
the
field
of
now
came
the
first
battle
a
tourney
of
horsemen
on
an
open
just
within
the
land
of
the
rebels
between
caen
and
mezidon
the
young
duke
fought
well
and
manfully
but
the
norman
writers
allow
that
it
was
french
help
that
gained
him
the
victory
yet
one
of
the
many
anecdotes
of
the
battle
points
to
a
source
of
strength
which
was
always
ready
to
tell
for
any
lord
against
rebellious
vassals
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
revolt
ralph
of
tesson
struck
with
remorse
and
stirred
by
the
prayers
of
his
knights
joined
the
duke
just
before
the
battle
he
had
sworn
to
smite
william
wherever
he
found
him
and
he
fulfilled
his
oath
by
giving
the
duke
a
harmless
blow
with
his
glove
how
far
an
oath
to
do
an
unlawful
act
is
binding
is
a
question
which
came
up
again
at
another
stage
of
life
the
victory
at
was
decisive
and
the
french
king
whose
help
had
done
so
much
to
win
it
left
william
to
follow
it
up
he
met
with
but
little
resistance
except
at
the
stronghold
of
brionne
guy
himself
vanishes
from
norman
history
william
had
now
conquered
his
own
duchy
and
conquered
it
by
foreign
help
for
the
rest
of
his
norman
reign
he
had
often
to
strive
with
enemies
at
home
but
he
had
never
to
put
down
such
a
rebellion
again
as
that
of
the
lords
of
western
normandy
that
western
normandy
the
truest
normandy
had
to
yield
to
the
more
thoroughly
romanized
lands
to
the
east
the
difference
between
them
never
again
takes
a
political
shape
william
was
now
lord
of
all
normandy
and
able
to
put
down
all
later
disturbers
of
the
peace
his
real
reign
now
begins
from
the
age
of
nineteen
or
twenty
his
acts
are
his
own
according
to
his
abiding
practice
he
showed
himself
a
merciful
conqueror
through
his
whole
reign
he
shows
a
distinct
unwillingness
to
take
human
life
except
in
fair
fighting
on
the
no
blood
was
shed
after
the
victory
of
one
rebel
died
in
bonds
the
others
underwent
no
harder
punishment
than
payment
of
fines
giving
of
hostages
and
destruction
of
their
castles
these
castles
were
not
as
yet
the
vast
and
elaborate
structures
which
arose
in
after
days
a
single
strong
square
tower
or
even
a
defence
of
wood
on
a
steep
mound
surrounded
by
a
ditch
was
enough
to
make
its
owner
dangerous
the
possession
of
these
strongholds
made
every
baron
able
at
once
to
defy
his
prince
and
to
make
himself
a
scourge
to
his
neighbours
every
season
of
anarchy
is
marked
by
the
building
of
castles
every
return
of
order
brings
with
it
their
overthrow
as
a
necessary
condition
of
peace
thus
in
his
lonely
and
troubled
childhood
william
had
been
schooled
for
the
rule
of
men
he
had
now
in
the
rule
of
a
smaller
dominion
in
warfare
and
conquest
on
a
smaller
scale
to
be
schooled
for
the
conquest
and
the
rule
of
a
greater
dominion
william
had
the
gifts
of
a
born
ruler
and
he
was
in
no
way
disposed
to
abuse
them
we
know
his
rule
in
normandy
only
through
the
language
of
panegyric
but
the
facts
speak
for
themselves
he
made
normandy
peaceful
and
flourishing
more
peaceful
and
flourishing
perhaps
than
any
other
state
of
the
european
mainland
he
is
set
before
us
as
in
everything
a
wise
and
beneficent
ruler
the
protector
of
the
poor
and
helpless
the
patron
of
commerce
and
of
all
that
might
profit
his
dominions
for
defensive
wars
for
wars
waged
as
the
faithful
man
of
his
overlord
we
can
not
blame
him
but
his
main
duty
lay
at
home
he
still
had
revolts
to
put
down
and
he
put
them
down
but
to
put
them
down
was
the
first
of
good
works
he
had
to
keep
the
peace
of
the
land
to
put
some
cheek
on
the
unruly
wills
of
those
turbulent
barons
on
whom
only
an
arm
like
his
could
put
any
cheek
he
had
in
the
language
of
his
day
to
do
justice
to
visit
wrong
with
sure
and
speedy
punishment
whoever
was
the
if
a
ruler
did
this
first
of
duties
well
much
was
easily
forgiven
him
in
other
ways
but
william
had
as
yet
little
to
be
forgiven
throughout
life
he
steadily
practised
some
unusual
virtues
his
strict
attention
to
religion
was
always
marked
and
his
religion
was
not
that
mere
lavish
bounty
to
the
church
which
was
consistent
with
any
amount
of
cruelty
or
license
religion
really
influenced
his
life
public
and
private
he
set
an
unusual
example
of
a
princely
household
governed
according
to
the
rules
of
morality
and
he
dealt
with
ecclesiastical
matters
in
the
spirit
of
a
true
reformer
he
did
not
like
so
many
princes
of
his
age
make
ecclesiastical
preferments
a
source
of
corrupt
gain
but
promoted
good
men
from
all
quarters
his
own
education
is
not
likely
to
have
received
much
attention
it
is
not
clear
whether
he
had
mastered
the
rarer
art
of
writing
or
the
more
usual
one
of
reading
but
both
his
promotion
of
learned
churchmen
and
the
care
given
to
the
education
of
some
of
his
children
show
that
he
at
least
valued
the
best
attainments
of
his
time
had
whole
life
been
spent
in
the
duties
of
a
norman
duke
ruling
his
duchy
wisely
defending
it
manfully
the
world
might
never
have
known
him
for
one
of
its
foremost
men
but
his
life
on
that
narrower
field
would
have
been
useful
and
honourable
almost
without
a
drawback
it
was
the
fatal
temptation
of
princes
the
temptation
to
territorial
aggrandizement
which
enabled
him
fully
to
show
the
powers
that
were
in
him
but
which
at
the
same
time
led
to
his
moral
degradation
the
defender
of
his
own
land
became
the
invader
of
other
lands
and
the
invader
could
not
fail
often
to
sink
into
the
oppressor
each
step
in
his
career
as
conqueror
was
a
step
downwards
maine
was
a
neighbouring
land
a
land
of
the
same
speech
a
land
which
if
the
feelings
of
the
time
could
have
allowed
a
willing
union
would
certainly
have
lost
nothing
by
an
union
with
normandy
england
a
land
apart
a
land
of
speech
laws
and
feelings
utterly
unlike
those
of
any
part
of
gaul
was
in
another
case
there
the
conqueror
was
driven
to
be
the
oppressor
wrong
as
ever
was
punished
by
leading
to
further
wrong
with
the
two
fields
nearer
and
more
distant
narrower
and
wider
on
which
william
was
to
appear
as
conqueror
he
has
as
yet
nothing
to
do
it
is
vain
to
guess
at
what
moment
the
thought
of
the
english
succession
may
have
entered
his
mind
or
that
of
his
advisers
when
william
began
his
real
reign
after
norman
influence
was
high
in
england
edward
the
confessor
had
spent
his
youth
among
his
norman
kinsfolk
he
loved
norman
ways
and
the
company
of
normans
and
other
men
of
french
speech
strangers
from
the
favoured
lands
held
endless
posts
in
church
and
state
above
all
robert
of
jumièges
first
bishop
of
london
and
then
archbishop
of
canterbury
was
the
special
favourite
and
adviser
these
men
may
have
suggested
the
thought
of
succession
very
early
on
the
other
hand
at
this
time
it
was
by
no
means
clear
that
edward
might
not
leave
a
son
of
his
own
he
had
been
only
a
few
years
married
and
his
alleged
vow
of
chastity
is
very
doubtful
claim
was
of
the
flimsiest
kind
by
english
custom
the
king
was
chosen
out
of
a
single
kingly
house
and
only
those
who
were
descended
from
kings
in
the
male
line
were
counted
as
members
of
that
house
william
was
not
descended
even
in
the
female
line
from
any
english
king
his
whole
kindred
with
edward
was
that
mother
emma
a
daughter
of
richard
the
fearless
was
such
a
kindred
to
say
nothing
of
bastardy
could
give
no
right
to
the
crown
according
to
any
doctrine
of
succession
that
ever
was
heard
of
it
could
at
most
point
him
out
as
a
candidate
for
adoption
in
case
the
reigning
king
should
be
disposed
and
allowed
to
choose
his
successor
william
or
his
advisers
may
have
begun
to
weigh
this
chance
very
early
but
all
that
is
really
certain
is
that
william
was
a
friend
and
favourite
of
his
elder
kinsman
and
that
events
finally
brought
his
succession
to
the
english
crown
within
the
range
of
things
that
might
be
but
before
this
william
was
to
show
himself
as
a
warrior
beyond
the
bounds
of
his
own
duchy
and
to
take
seizin
as
it
were
of
his
great
continental
conquest
first
war
out
of
normandy
was
waged
in
common
with
king
henry
against
geoffrey
martel
count
of
anjou
and
waged
on
the
side
of
maine
william
undoubtedly
owed
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
his
overlord
for
good
help
given
at
and
excuses
were
never
lacking
for
a
quarrel
between
anjou
and
normandy
both
powers
asserted
rights
over
the
intermediate
land
of
maine
in
we
find
william
giving
help
to
henry
in
a
war
with
anjou
and
we
hear
wonderful
but
vague
tales
of
his
exploits
the
really
instructive
part
of
the
story
deals
with
two
border
fortresses
on
the
march
of
normandy
and
maine
alençon
lay
on
the
norman
side
of
the
sarthe
but
it
was
disloyal
to
normandy
brionne
was
still
holding
out
for
guy
of
burgundy
the
town
was
a
lordship
of
the
house
of
bellême
a
house
renowned
for
power
and
wickedness
and
which
as
holding
great
possessions
alike
of
normandy
and
of
france
ranked
rather
with
princes
than
with
ordinary
nobles
the
story
went
that
william
talvas
lord
of
bellême
one
of
the
fiercest
of
his
race
had
cursed
william
in
his
cradle
as
one
by
whom
he
and
his
should
be
brought
to
shame
such
a
tale
set
forth
the
noblest
side
of
character
as
the
man
who
did
something
to
put
down
such
enemies
of
mankind
as
he
who
cursed
him
the
possessions
of
william
talvas
passed
through
his
daughter
mabel
to
roger
of
montgomery
a
man
who
plays
a
great
part
in
history
but
it
is
the
disloyalty
of
the
burghers
not
of
their
lord
of
which
we
hear
just
now
they
willingly
admitted
an
angevin
garrison
william
in
return
laid
siege
to
domfront
on
the
varenne
a
strong
castle
which
was
then
an
outpost
of
maine
against
normandy
a
long
skirmishing
warfare
in
which
william
won
for
himself
a
name
by
deeds
of
personal
prowess
went
on
during
the
autumn
and
winter
one
tale
specially
illustrates
more
than
one
point
in
the
feelings
of
the
time
the
two
princes
william
and
geoffrey
give
a
mutual
challenge
each
gives
the
other
notice
of
the
garb
and
shield
that
he
will
wear
that
he
may
not
be
mistaken
the
spirit
of
was
coming
in
and
we
see
that
william
himself
in
his
younger
days
was
touched
by
it
but
we
see
also
that
was
as
yet
unknown
geoffrey
and
his
host
so
the
normans
say
shrink
from
the
challenge
and
decamp
in
the
night
leaving
the
way
open
for
a
sudden
march
upon
alençon
the
disloyal
burghers
received
the
duke
with
mockery
of
his
birth
they
hung
out
skins
and
shouted
for
the
personal
insult
is
always
hard
for
princes
to
bear
and
the
wrath
of
william
was
stirred
up
to
a
pitch
which
made
him
for
once
depart
from
his
usual
moderation
towards
conquered
enemies
he
swore
that
the
men
who
had
jeered
at
him
should
be
dealt
with
like
a
tree
whose
branches
are
cut
off
with
the
the
town
was
taken
by
assault
and
william
kept
his
oath
the
castle
held
out
the
hands
and
feet
of
pollarded
burghers
of
alençon
were
thrown
over
its
walls
and
the
threat
implied
drove
the
garrison
to
surrender
on
promise
of
safety
for
life
and
limb
the
defenders
of
domfront
struck
with
fear
surrendered
also
and
kept
their
arms
as
well
as
their
lives
and
limbs
william
had
thus
won
back
his
own
rebellious
town
and
had
enlarged
his
borders
by
his
first
conquest
he
went
farther
south
and
fortified
another
castle
at
ambrières
but
ambrières
was
only
a
temporary
conquest
domfront
has
ever
since
been
counted
as
part
of
normandy
but
as
ecclesiastical
divisions
commonly
preserve
the
secular
divisions
of
an
earlier
time
domfront
remained
down
to
the
great
french
revolution
in
the
spiritual
jurisdiction
of
the
bishops
of
le
mans
william
had
now
shown
himself
in
maine
as
conqueror
and
he
was
before
long
to
show
himself
in
england
though
not
yet
as
conqueror
if
our
chronology
is
to
be
trusted
he
had
still
in
this
interval
to
complete
his
conquest
of
his
own
duchy
by
securing
the
surrender
of
brionne
and
two
other
events
both
characteristic
one
of
them
memorable
fill
up
the
same
time
william
now
banished
a
kinsman
of
his
own
name
who
held
the
great
county
of
mortain
or
in
the
diocese
of
avranches
which
must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
or
in
the
diocese
of
seez
this
act
of
somewhat
doubtful
justice
is
noteworthy
on
two
grounds
first
the
accuser
of
the
banished
count
was
one
who
was
then
a
poor
of
his
own
but
who
became
the
forefather
of
a
house
which
plays
a
great
part
in
english
history
robert
surnamed
the
bigod
secondly
the
vacant
county
was
granted
by
william
to
his
own
robert
he
had
already
in
bestowed
the
bishopric
of
bayeux
on
his
other
odo
who
can
not
at
that
time
have
been
more
than
twelve
years
old
he
must
therefore
have
held
the
see
for
a
good
while
without
consecration
and
at
no
time
of
his
fifty
holding
of
it
did
he
show
any
very
episcopal
merits
this
was
the
last
case
in
reign
of
an
old
abuse
by
which
the
chief
church
preferments
in
normandy
had
been
turned
into
means
of
providing
for
members
often
unworthy
members
of
the
ducal
family
and
it
is
the
only
one
for
which
william
can
have
been
personally
responsible
both
his
brothers
were
thus
placed
very
early
in
life
among
the
chief
men
of
normandy
as
they
were
in
later
years
to
be
placed
among
the
chief
men
of
england
but
affection
for
his
brothers
amiable
as
it
may
have
been
personally
was
assuredly
not
among
the
brighter
parts
of
his
character
as
a
sovereign
the
other
chief
event
of
this
time
also
concerns
the
domestic
side
of
life
the
long
story
of
his
marriage
now
begins
the
date
is
fixed
by
one
of
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
rheims
held
in
by
pope
leo
the
ninth
in
which
baldwin
count
of
flanders
is
forbidden
to
give
his
daughter
to
william
the
norman
this
implies
that
the
marriage
was
already
thought
of
and
further
that
it
was
looked
on
as
uncanonical
the
bride
whom
william
sought
matilda
daughter
of
baldwin
the
fifth
was
connected
with
him
by
some
tie
of
kindred
or
affinity
which
made
a
marriage
between
them
unlawful
by
the
rules
of
the
church
but
no
genealogist
has
yet
been
able
to
find
out
exactly
what
the
canonical
hindrance
was
it
is
hard
to
trace
the
descent
of
william
and
matilda
up
to
any
common
forefather
but
the
light
which
the
story
throws
on
character
is
the
same
in
any
case
whether
he
was
seeking
a
wife
or
a
kingdom
he
would
have
his
will
but
he
could
wait
for
it
in
doubtful
position
a
marriage
with
the
daughter
of
the
count
of
flanders
would
be
useful
to
him
in
many
ways
and
matilda
won
her
abiding
love
and
trust
strange
tales
are
told
of
wooing
tales
are
told
also
of
earlier
love
for
the
englishman
brihtric
who
is
said
to
have
found
favour
in
her
eyes
when
he
came
as
envoy
from
england
to
her
court
all
that
is
certain
is
that
the
marriage
had
been
thought
of
and
had
been
forbidden
before
the
next
important
event
in
life
that
we
have
to
record
was
flemish
marriage
in
any
way
connected
with
his
hopes
of
succession
to
the
english
crown
had
there
been
any
available
bride
for
him
in
england
it
might
have
been
for
his
interest
to
seek
for
her
there
but
it
should
be
noticed
though
no
ancient
writer
points
out
the
fact
that
matilda
was
actually
descended
from
alfred
in
the
female
line
so
that
children
though
not
william
himself
had
some
few
drops
of
english
blood
in
their
veins
william
or
his
advisers
in
weighing
every
chance
which
might
help
his
interests
in
the
direction
of
england
may
have
reckoned
this
piece
of
rather
ancient
genealogy
among
the
advantages
of
a
flemish
alliance
but
it
is
far
more
certain
that
between
the
forbidding
of
the
marriage
and
the
marriage
itself
a
direct
hope
of
succession
to
the
english
crown
had
been
opened
to
the
norman
duke
chapter
iii
first
visit
to
england
while
william
was
strengthening
himself
in
normandy
norman
influence
in
england
had
risen
to
its
full
height
the
king
was
surrounded
by
foreign
favourites
the
only
foreign
earl
was
his
nephew
ralph
of
mentes
the
son
of
his
sister
godgifu
but
three
chief
bishoprics
were
held
by
normans
robert
of
canterbury
william
of
london
and
ulf
of
dorchester
william
bears
a
good
character
and
won
the
esteem
of
englishmen
but
the
unlearned
ulf
is
emphatically
said
to
have
done
smaller
preferments
in
church
and
state
estates
in
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
were
lavishly
granted
to
strangers
they
built
castles
and
otherwise
gave
offence
to
english
feeling
archbishop
robert
above
all
was
ever
plotting
against
godwine
earl
of
the
the
head
of
the
national
party
at
last
in
the
autumn
of
the
national
indignation
burst
forth
the
immediate
occasion
was
a
visit
paid
to
the
king
by
count
eustace
of
boulogne
who
had
just
married
the
widowed
countess
godgifu
the
violent
dealings
of
his
followers
towards
the
burghers
of
dover
led
to
resistance
on
their
part
and
to
a
long
series
of
marches
and
negotiations
which
ended
in
the
banishment
of
godwine
and
his
son
and
the
parting
of
his
daughter
edith
the
wife
from
her
husband
from
october
to
september
the
normans
had
their
own
way
in
england
and
during
that
time
king
edward
received
a
visitor
of
greater
fame
than
his
from
boulogne
in
the
person
of
his
cousin
from
rouen
of
his
visit
we
only
read
that
earl
came
from
beyond
sea
with
mickle
company
of
frenchmen
and
the
king
him
received
and
as
many
of
his
comrades
as
to
him
seemed
good
and
let
him
go
another
account
adds
that
william
received
great
gifts
from
the
king
but
william
himself
in
several
documents
speaks
of
edward
as
his
lord
he
must
therefore
at
some
time
have
done
to
edward
an
act
of
homage
and
there
is
no
time
but
this
at
which
we
can
conceive
such
an
act
being
done
now
for
what
was
the
homage
paid
homage
was
often
paid
on
very
trifling
occasions
and
strange
conflicts
of
allegiance
often
followed
no
such
conflict
was
likely
to
arise
if
the
duke
of
the
normans
already
the
man
of
the
king
of
the
french
for
his
duchy
became
the
man
of
the
king
of
the
english
on
any
other
ground
betwixt
england
and
france
there
was
as
yet
no
enmity
or
rivalry
england
and
france
became
enemies
afterwards
because
the
king
of
the
english
and
the
duke
of
the
normans
were
one
person
and
this
visit
this
homage
was
the
first
step
towards
making
the
king
of
the
english
and
the
duke
of
the
normans
the
same
person
the
claim
william
had
to
the
english
crown
rested
mainly
on
an
alleged
promise
of
the
succession
made
by
edward
this
claim
is
not
likely
to
have
been
a
mere
shameless
falsehood
that
edward
did
make
some
promise
to
that
harold
at
a
later
stage
did
take
some
oath
to
fully
proved
by
the
fact
that
while
such
norman
statements
as
could
be
denied
were
emphatically
denied
by
the
english
writers
on
these
two
points
the
most
patriotic
englishmen
the
strongest
partisans
of
harold
keep
a
marked
silence
we
may
be
sure
therefore
that
some
promise
was
made
for
that
promise
a
time
must
be
found
and
no
time
seems
possible
except
this
time
of
visit
to
edward
the
date
rests
on
no
direct
authority
but
it
answers
every
requirement
those
who
spoke
of
the
promise
as
being
made
earlier
when
william
and
edward
were
boys
together
in
normandy
forgot
that
edward
was
many
years
older
than
william
the
only
possible
moment
earlier
than
the
visit
was
when
edward
was
elected
king
in
before
that
time
he
could
hardly
have
thought
of
disposing
of
a
kingdom
which
was
not
his
and
at
that
time
he
might
have
looked
forward
to
leaving
sons
to
succeed
him
still
less
could
the
promise
have
been
made
later
than
the
visit
from
to
the
end
of
his
life
edward
was
under
english
influences
which
led
him
first
to
send
for
his
nephew
edward
from
hungary
as
his
successor
and
in
the
end
to
make
a
recommendation
in
favour
of
harold
but
in
edward
whether
under
a
vow
or
not
may
well
have
given
up
the
hope
of
children
he
was
surrounded
by
norman
influences
and
for
the
only
time
in
the
last
years
of
their
joint
lives
he
and
william
met
face
to
face
the
only
difficulty
is
one
to
which
no
contemporary
writer
makes
any
reference
if
edward
wished
to
dispose
of
his
crown
in
favour
of
one
of
his
kinsmen
he
had
a
nearer
kinsman
of
whom
he
might
more
naturally
have
thought
his
own
nephew
ralph
was
living
in
england
and
holding
an
english
earldom
he
had
the
advantage
over
both
william
and
his
own
older
brother
walter
of
mantes
in
not
being
a
reigning
prince
elsewhere
we
can
only
say
that
there
is
evidence
that
edward
did
think
of
william
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
ever
thought
of
ralph
and
except
the
tie
of
nearer
kindred
everything
would
suggest
william
rather
than
ralph
the
personal
comparison
is
almost
grotesque
and
early
associations
and
the
strongest
influences
around
him
were
not
vaguely
french
but
specially
norman
archbishop
robert
would
plead
for
his
own
native
sovereign
only
in
short
we
may
be
as
nearly
sure
as
we
can
be
of
any
fact
for
which
there
is
no
direct
authority
that
promise
to
william
was
made
at
the
time
of
visit
to
england
and
that
homage
to
edward
was
done
in
the
character
of
a
destined
successor
to
the
english
crown
william
then
came
to
england
a
mere
duke
and
went
back
to
normandy
a
king
expectant
but
the
value
of
his
hopes
to
the
value
of
the
promise
made
to
him
are
quite
another
matter
most
likely
they
were
rated
on
both
sides
far
above
their
real
value
king
and
duke
may
both
have
believed
that
they
were
making
a
settlement
which
the
english
nation
was
bound
to
respect
if
so
edward
at
least
was
undeceived
within
a
few
months
the
notion
of
a
king
disposing
of
his
crown
by
his
own
act
belongs
to
the
same
range
of
ideas
as
the
law
of
strict
hereditary
succession
it
implies
that
kingship
is
a
possession
and
not
an
office
neither
the
heathen
nor
the
christian
english
had
ever
admitted
that
doctrine
but
it
was
fast
growing
on
the
continent
our
forefathers
had
always
combined
respect
for
the
kingly
house
with
some
measure
of
choice
among
the
members
of
that
house
edward
himself
was
not
the
lawful
heir
according
to
the
notions
of
a
modern
lawyer
for
he
was
chosen
while
the
son
of
his
elder
brother
was
living
every
english
king
held
his
crown
by
the
gift
of
the
great
assembly
of
the
nation
though
the
choice
of
the
nation
was
usually
limited
to
the
descendants
of
former
kings
and
though
the
son
of
the
late
king
was
seldom
opposed
christianity
had
strengthened
the
election
principle
the
king
lost
his
old
sanctity
as
the
son
of
woden
he
gained
a
new
sanctity
as
the
anointed
but
kingship
thereby
became
more
distinctly
an
office
a
great
post
like
a
bishopric
to
which
its
holder
had
to
be
lawfully
chosen
and
admitted
by
solemn
rites
but
of
that
office
he
could
be
lawfully
deprived
nor
could
he
hand
it
on
to
a
successor
either
according
to
his
own
will
or
according
to
any
strict
law
of
succession
the
wishes
of
the
late
king
like
the
wishes
of
the
late
bishop
went
for
something
with
the
electors
but
that
was
all
all
that
edward
could
really
do
for
his
kinsmen
was
to
promise
to
make
when
the
time
came
a
recommendation
to
the
witan
in
his
favour
the
witan
might
then
deal
as
they
thought
good
with
a
recommendation
so
unusual
as
to
choose
to
the
kingship
of
england
a
man
who
was
neither
a
native
nor
a
conqueror
of
england
nor
the
descendant
of
any
english
king
when
the
time
came
edward
did
make
a
recommendation
to
the
witan
but
it
was
not
in
favour
of
william
the
english
influences
under
which
he
was
brought
during
his
last
fourteen
years
taught
him
better
what
the
law
of
england
was
and
what
was
the
duty
of
an
english
king
but
at
the
time
of
visit
edward
may
well
have
believed
that
he
could
by
his
own
act
settle
his
crown
on
his
norman
kinsman
as
his
undoubted
successor
in
case
he
died
without
a
son
and
it
may
be
that
edward
was
bound
by
a
vow
not
to
leave
a
son
and
if
edward
so
thought
william
naturally
thought
so
yet
more
he
would
sincerely
believe
himself
to
be
the
lawful
heir
of
the
crown
of
england
the
sole
lawful
successor
except
in
one
contingency
which
was
perhaps
impossible
and
certainly
unlikely
the
memorials
of
these
times
so
full
on
some
points
are
meagre
on
others
of
those
writers
who
mention
the
bequest
or
promise
none
mention
it
at
any
time
when
it
is
supposed
to
have
happened
they
mention
it
at
some
later
time
when
it
began
to
be
of
practical
importance
no
english
writer
speaks
of
claim
till
the
time
when
he
was
about
practically
to
assert
it
no
norman
writer
speaks
of
it
till
he
tells
the
tale
of
visit
and
oath
to
william
we
therefore
can
not
say
how
far
the
promise
was
known
either
in
england
or
on
the
continent
but
it
could
not
be
kept
altogether
hid
even
if
either
party
wished
it
to
be
hid
english
statesmen
must
have
known
of
it
and
must
have
guided
their
policy
accordingly
whether
it
was
generally
known
in
the
country
or
not
position
both
in
his
own
duchy
and
among
neighbouring
princes
would
be
greatly
improved
if
he
could
be
looked
upon
as
a
future
king
as
heir
to
the
crown
of
england
he
may
have
more
earnestly
wooed
the
descendant
of
former
wearers
of
the
crown
and
matilda
and
her
father
may
have
looked
more
favourably
on
a
suitor
to
whom
the
crown
of
england
was
promised
on
the
other
hand
the
existence
of
such
a
foreign
claimant
made
it
more
needful
than
ever
for
englishmen
to
be
ready
with
an
english
successor
in
the
royal
house
or
out
of
it
the
moment
the
reigning
king
should
pass
away
it
was
only
for
a
short
time
that
william
could
have
had
any
reasonable
hope
of
a
peaceful
succession
the
time
of
norman
influence
in
england
was
short
the
revolution
of
september
brought
godwine
back
and
placed
the
rule
of
england
again
in
english
hands
many
normans
were
banished
above
all
archbishop
robert
and
bishop
ulf
the
death
of
godwine
the
next
year
placed
the
chief
power
in
the
hands
of
his
son
harold
this
change
undoubtedly
made
edward
more
disposed
to
the
national
cause
of
godwine
the
man
to
whom
he
owed
his
crown
he
was
clearly
in
awe
to
sons
he
was
personally
attached
we
know
not
how
edward
was
led
to
look
on
his
promise
to
william
as
void
that
he
was
so
led
is
quite
plain
he
sent
for
his
nephew
the
ætheling
edward
from
hungary
clearly
as
his
intended
successor
when
the
ætheling
died
in
leaving
a
son
under
age
men
seem
to
have
gradually
come
to
look
to
harold
as
the
probable
successor
he
clearly
held
a
special
position
above
that
of
an
ordinary
earl
but
there
is
no
need
to
suppose
any
formal
act
in
his
favour
till
the
time
of
the
death
january
on
his
deathbed
edward
did
all
that
he
legally
could
do
on
behalf
of
harold
by
recommending
him
to
the
witan
for
election
as
the
next
king
that
he
then
either
made
a
new
or
renewed
an
old
nomination
in
favour
of
william
is
a
fable
which
is
set
aside
by
the
witness
of
the
contemporary
english
writers
claim
rested
wholly
on
that
earlier
nomination
which
could
hardly
have
been
made
at
any
other
time
than
his
visit
to
england
we
have
now
to
follow
william
back
to
normandy
for
the
remaining
years
of
his
purely
ducal
reign
the
expectant
king
had
doubtless
thoughts
and
hopes
which
he
had
not
had
before
but
we
can
guess
at
them
only
they
are
not
recorded
chapter
iv
the
reign
of
william
in
normandy
if
william
came
back
from
england
looking
forward
to
a
future
crown
the
thought
might
even
then
flash
across
his
mind
that
he
was
not
likely
to
win
that
crown
without
fighting
for
it
as
yet
his
business
was
still
to
fight
for
the
duchy
of
normandy
but
he
had
now
to
fight
not
to
win
his
duchy
but
only
to
keep
it
for
five
years
he
had
to
strive
both
against
rebellious
subjects
and
against
invading
enemies
among
whom
king
henry
of
paris
is
again
the
foremost
whatever
motives
had
led
the
french
king
to
help
william
at
had
now
passed
away
he
had
fallen
back
on
his
former
state
of
abiding
enmity
towards
normandy
and
her
duke
but
this
short
period
definitely
fixed
the
position
of
normandy
and
her
duke
in
gaul
and
in
europe
at
its
beginning
william
is
still
the
bastard
of
falaise
who
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
keep
himself
in
the
ducal
chair
his
right
to
which
is
still
disputed
at
the
end
of
it
if
he
is
not
yet
the
conqueror
and
the
great
he
has
shown
all
the
gifts
that
were
needed
to
win
him
either
name
he
is
the
greatest
vassal
of
the
french
crown
a
vassal
more
powerful
than
the
overlord
whose
invasions
of
his
duchy
he
has
had
to
drive
back
these
invasions
of
normandy
by
the
king
of
the
french
and
his
allies
fall
into
two
periods
at
first
henry
appears
in
normandy
as
the
supporter
of
normans
in
open
revolt
against
their
duke
but
revolts
are
personal
and
local
there
is
no
rebellion
like
that
which
was
crushed
at
spreading
over
a
large
part
of
the
duchy
in
the
second
period
the
invaders
have
no
such
there
are
still
traitors
there
are
still
rebels
but
all
that
they
can
do
is
to
join
the
invaders
after
they
have
entered
the
land
william
is
still
only
making
his
way
to
the
universal
good
will
of
his
duchy
but
he
is
fast
making
it
there
is
first
of
all
an
obscure
tale
of
a
revolt
of
an
unfixed
date
but
which
must
have
happened
between
and
the
rebel
william
busac
of
the
house
of
eu
is
said
to
have
defended
the
castle
of
eu
against
the
duke
and
to
have
gone
into
banishment
in
france
but
the
year
that
followed
visit
to
england
saw
the
far
more
memorable
revolt
of
william
count
of
arques
he
had
drawn
the
suspicions
on
him
and
he
had
to
receive
a
ducal
garrison
in
his
great
fortress
by
dieppe
but
the
garrison
betrayed
the
castle
to
its
own
master
open
revolt
and
havoc
followed
in
which
count
william
was
supported
by
the
king
and
by
several
other
princes
among
them
was
ingelram
count
of
ponthieu
husband
of
the
sister
adelaide
another
enemy
was
guy
count
of
gascony
afterwards
duke
william
the
eighth
of
aquitaine
what
quarrel
a
prince
in
the
furthest
corner
of
gaul
could
have
with
the
duke
of
the
normans
does
not
appear
but
neither
count
william
nor
his
allies
could
withstand
the
loyal
normans
and
their
prince
count
ingelram
was
killed
the
other
princes
withdrew
to
devise
greater
efforts
against
normandy
count
william
lost
his
castle
and
part
of
his
estates
and
left
the
duchy
of
his
free
will
the
politic
forbearance
at
last
won
him
the
general
good
will
of
his
subjects
we
hear
of
no
more
open
revolts
till
that
of
own
son
many
years
after
but
the
assaults
of
foreign
enemies
helped
sometimes
by
norman
traitors
begin
again
the
next
year
on
a
greater
scale
william
the
ruler
and
warrior
had
now
a
short
he
had
doubtless
come
back
from
england
more
bent
than
ever
on
his
marriage
with
matilda
of
flanders
notwithstanding
the
decree
of
a
pope
and
a
council
entitled
to
special
respect
the
marriage
was
celebrated
not
very
long
after
return
to
normandy
in
the
year
of
the
revolt
of
william
of
arques
in
the
course
of
the
year
count
baldwin
brought
his
daughter
to
the
norman
frontier
at
eu
and
there
she
became
the
bride
of
william
we
know
not
what
emboldened
william
to
risk
so
daring
a
step
at
this
particular
time
or
what
led
baldwin
to
consent
to
it
if
it
was
suggested
by
the
imprisonment
of
pope
leo
by
countrymen
in
italy
in
the
hope
that
a
consent
to
the
marriage
would
be
wrung
out
of
the
captive
pontiff
that
hope
was
disappointed
the
marriage
raised
much
opposition
in
normandy
it
was
denounced
by
archbishop
malger
of
rouen
the
brother
of
the
dispossessed
count
of
arques
his
character
certainly
added
no
weight
to
his
censures
but
the
same
act
in
a
saint
would
have
been
set
down
as
a
sign
of
holy
boldness
presently
whether
for
his
faults
or
for
his
merits
malger
was
deposed
in
a
synod
of
the
norman
church
and
william
found
him
a
worthier
successor
in
the
learned
and
holy
maurilius
but
a
greater
man
than
malger
also
opposed
the
marriage
and
the
controversy
thus
introduces
us
to
one
who
fills
a
place
second
only
to
that
of
william
himself
in
the
norman
and
english
history
of
the
time
this
was
lanfranc
of
pavia
the
lawyer
the
scholar
the
model
monk
the
ecclesiastical
statesman
who
as
prior
of
the
newly
founded
abbey
of
bec
was
already
one
of
the
innermost
counsellors
of
the
duke
as
duke
and
king
as
prior
abbot
and
archbishop
william
and
lanfranc
ruled
side
by
side
each
helping
the
work
of
the
other
till
the
end
of
their
joint
lives
once
only
at
this
time
was
their
friendship
broken
for
a
moment
lanfranc
spoke
against
the
marriage
and
ventured
to
rebuke
the
duke
himself
wrath
was
kindled
he
ordered
lanfranc
into
banishment
and
took
a
baser
revenge
by
laying
waste
part
of
the
lands
of
the
abbey
but
the
quarrel
was
soon
made
up
lanfranc
presently
left
normandy
not
as
a
banished
man
but
as
the
envoy
of
its
sovereign
commissioned
to
work
for
the
confirmation
of
the
marriage
at
the
papal
court
he
worked
and
his
work
was
crowned
with
success
but
not
with
speedy
success
it
was
not
till
six
years
after
the
marriage
not
till
the
year
that
lanfranc
obtained
the
wished
for
confirmation
not
from
leo
but
from
his
remote
successor
nicolas
the
second
the
sin
of
those
who
had
contracted
the
unlawful
union
was
purged
by
various
good
works
among
which
the
foundation
of
the
two
stately
abbeys
of
caen
was
conspicuous
this
story
illustrates
many
points
in
the
character
of
william
and
of
his
time
his
will
is
not
to
be
thwarted
whether
in
a
matter
of
marriage
or
of
any
other
but
he
does
not
hurry
matters
he
waits
for
a
favourable
opportunity
something
we
know
not
what
must
have
made
the
year
more
favourable
than
the
year
we
mark
also
relations
to
the
church
he
is
at
no
time
disposed
to
submit
quietly
to
the
bidding
of
the
spiritual
power
when
it
interferes
with
his
rights
or
even
when
it
crosses
his
will
yet
he
is
really
anxious
for
ecclesiastical
reform
he
promotes
men
like
maurilius
and
lanfranc
perhaps
he
is
not
displeased
when
the
exercise
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
in
the
case
of
malger
frees
him
from
a
troublesome
censor
but
the
worse
side
of
him
also
comes
out
william
could
forgive
rebels
but
he
could
not
bear
the
personal
rebuke
even
of
his
friend
under
this
feeling
he
punishes
a
whole
body
of
men
for
the
offence
of
one
to
lay
waste
the
lands
of
bec
for
the
rebuke
of
lanfranc
was
like
an
ordinary
prince
of
the
time
it
was
unlike
william
if
he
had
not
been
stirred
up
by
a
censure
which
touched
his
wife
as
well
as
himself
but
above
all
the
bargain
between
william
and
lanfranc
is
characteristic
of
the
man
and
the
age
lanfranc
goes
to
rome
to
support
a
marriage
which
he
had
censured
in
normandy
but
there
is
no
formal
inconsistency
no
forsaking
of
any
principle
lanfranc
holds
an
uncanonical
marriage
to
be
a
sin
and
he
denounces
it
he
does
not
withdraw
his
judgement
as
to
its
sinfulness
he
simply
uses
his
influence
with
a
power
that
can
forgive
the
sin
to
get
it
forgiven
while
marriage
was
debated
at
rome
he
had
to
fight
hard
in
normandy
his
warfare
and
his
negotiations
ended
about
the
same
time
and
the
two
things
may
have
had
their
bearing
on
one
another
william
had
now
to
undergo
a
new
form
of
trial
the
king
of
the
french
had
never
put
forth
his
full
strength
when
he
was
simply
backing
norman
rebels
william
had
now
in
two
successive
invasions
to
withstand
the
whole
power
of
the
king
and
of
as
many
of
his
vassals
as
the
king
could
bring
to
his
standard
in
the
first
invasion
in
the
norman
writers
speak
rhetorically
of
warriors
from
burgundy
auvergne
and
gascony
but
it
is
hard
to
see
any
troops
from
a
greater
distance
than
bourges
the
princes
who
followed
henry
seem
to
have
been
only
the
nearer
vassals
of
the
crown
chief
among
them
are
theobald
count
of
chartres
of
a
house
of
old
hostile
to
normandy
and
guy
the
new
count
of
ponthieu
to
be
often
heard
of
again
if
not
geoffrey
of
anjou
himself
his
subjects
from
tours
were
also
there
normandy
was
to
be
invaded
on
two
sides
on
both
banks
of
the
seine
the
king
and
his
allies
sought
to
wrest
from
william
the
western
part
of
normandy
the
older
and
the
more
thoroughly
french
part
no
attack
seems
to
have
been
designed
on
the
bessin
or
the
côtentin
william
was
to
be
allowed
to
keep
those
parts
of
his
duchy
against
which
he
had
to
fight
when
the
king
was
his
ally
at
the
two
armies
entered
normandy
that
which
was
to
act
on
the
left
of
the
seine
was
led
by
the
king
the
other
by
his
brother
odo
against
the
king
william
made
ready
to
act
himself
eastern
normandy
was
left
to
its
own
loyal
nobles
but
all
normandy
was
now
loyal
the
men
of
the
saxon
and
danish
lands
were
as
ready
to
fight
for
their
duke
against
the
king
as
they
had
been
to
fight
against
king
and
duke
together
but
william
avoided
pitched
battles
indeed
pitched
battles
are
rare
in
the
continental
warfare
of
the
time
war
consists
largely
in
surprises
and
still
more
in
the
attack
and
defence
of
fortified
places
the
plan
of
present
campaign
was
wholly
defensive
provisions
and
cattle
were
to
be
carried
out
of
the
french
line
of
march
the
duke
on
his
side
the
other
norman
leaders
on
the
other
side
were
to
watch
the
enemy
and
attack
them
at
any
favourable
moment
the
commanders
east
of
the
seine
count
robert
of
eu
hugh
of
gournay
william
crispin
and
walter
giffard
found
their
opportunity
when
the
french
had
entered
the
unfortified
town
of
mortemer
and
had
given
themselves
up
to
revelry
fire
and
sword
did
the
work
the
whole
french
army
was
slain
scattered
or
taken
prisoners
ode
escaped
guy
of
ponthieu
was
taken
the
success
was
still
easier
the
tale
runs
that
the
news
from
mortemer
suddenly
announced
to
the
army
in
the
dead
of
the
night
struck
them
with
panic
and
led
to
a
hasty
retreat
out
of
the
land
this
campaign
is
truly
norman
it
is
wholly
unlike
the
simple
warfare
of
england
a
traitorous
englishman
did
nothing
or
helped
the
enemy
a
patriotic
englishman
gave
battle
to
the
enemy
the
first
time
he
had
a
chance
but
no
english
commander
of
the
eleventh
century
was
likely
to
lay
so
subtle
a
plan
as
this
and
if
he
had
laid
such
a
plan
he
would
hardly
have
found
an
english
army
able
to
carry
it
out
harold
who
refused
to
lay
waste
a
rood
of
english
ground
would
hardly
have
looked
quietly
on
while
many
roods
of
english
ground
were
wasted
by
the
enemy
with
all
the
valour
of
the
normans
what
before
all
things
distinguished
them
from
other
nations
was
their
craft
william
could
indeed
fight
a
pitched
battle
when
a
pitched
battle
served
his
purpose
but
he
could
control
himself
he
could
control
his
followers
even
to
the
point
of
enduring
to
look
quietly
on
the
havoc
of
their
own
land
till
the
right
moment
he
who
could
do
this
was
indeed
practising
for
his
calling
as
conqueror
and
if
the
details
of
the
story
details
specially
characteristic
are
to
be
believed
william
showed
something
also
of
that
grim
pleasantry
which
was
another
marked
feature
in
the
norman
character
the
startling
message
which
struck
the
french
army
with
panic
was
deliberately
sent
with
that
end
the
messenger
sent
climbs
a
tree
or
a
rock
and
with
a
voice
as
from
another
world
bids
the
french
awake
they
are
sleeping
too
long
let
them
go
and
bury
their
friends
who
are
lying
dead
at
mortemer
these
touches
bring
home
to
us
the
character
of
the
man
and
the
people
with
whom
our
forefathers
had
presently
to
deal
william
was
the
greatest
of
his
race
but
he
was
essentially
of
his
race
he
was
norman
to
the
backbone
of
the
french
army
one
division
had
been
surprised
and
cut
to
pieces
the
other
had
left
normandy
without
striking
a
blow
the
war
was
not
yet
quite
over
the
french
still
kept
tillières
william
accordingly
fortified
the
stronghold
of
breteuil
as
a
cheek
upon
it
and
he
entrusted
the
command
to
a
man
who
will
soon
be
memorable
his
personal
friend
william
son
of
his
old
guardian
osbern
king
henry
was
now
glad
to
conclude
a
peace
on
somewhat
remarkable
terms
william
had
the
leave
to
take
what
he
could
from
count
geoffrey
of
anjou
he
now
annexed
is
just
now
at
more
points
than
one
but
chiefly
on
the
line
of
his
earlier
advances
to
domfront
and
ambrières
ambrières
had
perhaps
been
lost
for
william
now
sent
geoffrey
a
challenge
to
come
on
the
fortieth
day
he
came
on
the
fortieth
day
and
found
ambrières
strongly
fortified
and
occupied
by
a
norman
garrison
with
geoffrey
came
the
breton
prince
ode
and
william
or
peter
duke
of
aquitaine
they
besieged
the
castle
but
norman
accounts
add
that
they
all
fled
on
approach
to
relieve
it
three
years
of
peace
now
followed
but
in
king
henry
this
time
in
partnership
with
geoffrey
of
anjou
ventured
another
invasion
of
normandy
he
might
say
that
he
had
never
been
fairly
beaten
in
his
former
campaign
but
that
he
had
been
simply
cheated
out
of
the
land
by
norman
wiles
this
time
he
had
a
second
experience
of
norman
wiles
and
of
norman
strength
too
king
and
count
entered
the
land
and
ravaged
far
and
wide
william
as
before
allowed
the
enemy
to
waste
the
land
he
watched
and
followed
them
till
he
found
a
favourable
moment
for
attack
the
people
in
general
zealously
helped
the
schemes
but
some
traitors
of
rank
were
still
leagued
with
the
count
of
anjou
while
william
bided
his
time
the
invaders
burned
caen
this
place
so
famous
in
norman
history
was
not
one
of
the
ancient
cities
of
the
land
it
was
now
merely
growing
into
importance
and
it
was
as
yet
undefended
by
walls
or
castle
but
when
the
ravagers
turned
eastward
william
found
the
opportunity
that
he
had
waited
for
as
the
french
were
crossing
the
ford
of
varaville
on
the
dive
near
the
mouth
of
that
river
he
came
suddenly
on
them
and
slaughtered
a
large
part
of
the
army
under
the
eyes
of
the
king
who
had
already
crossed
the
remnant
marched
out
of
normandy
henry
now
made
peace
and
restored
tillières
not
long
after
in
the
king
died
leaving
his
young
son
philip
who
had
been
already
crowned
as
his
successor
under
the
guardianship
of
baldwin
geoffrey
of
anjou
and
william
of
aquitaine
also
died
and
the
angevin
power
was
weakened
by
the
division
of
dominions
between
his
nephews
position
was
greatly
strengthened
now
that
france
under
the
new
regent
had
become
friendly
while
anjou
was
no
longer
able
to
do
mischief
william
had
now
nothing
to
fear
from
his
neighbours
and
the
way
was
soon
opened
for
his
great
continental
conquest
but
what
effect
had
these
events
on
views
on
england
about
the
time
of
the
second
french
invasion
of
normandy
earl
harold
became
beyond
doubt
the
first
man
in
england
and
for
the
first
time
a
chance
of
the
royal
succession
was
opened
to
him
in
the
year
before
varaville
the
ætheling
edward
the
selected
successor
died
soon
after
his
coming
to
england
in
the
same
year
died
the
nephew
earl
ralph
and
leofric
earl
of
the
mercians
the
only
englishmen
whose
influence
could
at
all
compare
with
that
of
harold
succession
now
became
possible
it
became
even
likely
if
edward
should
die
while
edgar
the
son
of
the
ætheling
was
still
under
age
william
had
no
shadow
of
excuse
for
interfering
but
he
doubtless
was
watching
the
internal
affairs
of
england
harold
was
certainly
watching
the
affairs
of
gaul
about
this
time
most
likely
in
the
year
he
made
a
pilgrimage
to
rome
and
on
his
way
back
he
looked
diligently
into
the
state
of
things
among
the
various
vassals
of
the
french
crown
his
exact
purpose
is
veiled
in
ambiguous
language
but
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
his
object
was
to
contract
alliances
with
the
continental
enemies
of
normandy
such
views
looked
to
the
distant
future
as
william
had
as
yet
been
guilty
of
no
unfriendly
act
towards
england
but
it
was
well
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
king
henry
count
geoffrey
and
duke
william
of
aquitaine
in
case
a
time
should
come
when
their
interests
and
those
of
england
would
be
the
same
but
the
deaths
of
all
those
princes
must
have
put
an
end
to
all
hopes
of
common
action
between
england
and
any
gaulish
power
the
emperor
henry
also
the
firm
ally
of
england
was
dead
it
was
now
clear
that
if
england
should
ever
have
to
withstand
a
norman
attack
she
would
have
to
withstand
it
wholly
by
her
own
strength
or
with
such
help
as
she
might
find
among
the
kindred
powers
of
the
north
great
continental
conquest
is
drawing
nigh
but
between
the
campaign
of
varaville
and
the
campaign
of
le
mans
came
the
tardy
papal
confirmation
of
marriage
the
duke
and
duchess
now
at
last
man
and
wife
in
the
eye
of
the
church
began
to
carry
out
the
works
of
penance
which
were
allotted
to
them
the
abbeys
of
caen
saint
holy
trinity
now
began
to
arise
yet
at
this
moment
of
reparation
one
or
two
facts
seem
to
place
government
of
his
duchy
in
a
less
favourable
light
than
usual
the
last
french
invasion
was
followed
by
confiscations
and
banishments
among
the
chief
men
of
normandy
roger
of
montgomery
and
his
wife
mabel
who
certainly
was
capable
of
any
deed
of
blood
or
treachery
are
charged
with
acting
as
false
accusers
we
see
also
that
as
late
as
the
day
of
varaville
there
were
norman
traitors
robert
of
escalfoy
had
taken
the
angevin
side
and
had
defended
his
castle
against
the
duke
he
died
in
a
strange
way
after
snatching
an
apple
from
the
hand
of
his
own
wife
his
nephew
arnold
remained
in
rebellion
three
years
and
was
simply
required
to
go
to
the
wars
in
apulia
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
the
duke
had
poisoned
the
apple
if
poisoned
it
was
but
finding
treason
still
at
work
among
his
nobles
he
may
have
too
hastily
listened
to
charges
against
men
who
had
done
him
good
service
and
who
were
to
do
him
good
service
again
five
years
after
the
combat
at
varaville
william
really
began
to
deserve
though
not
as
yet
to
receive
the
name
of
conqueror
for
he
now
did
a
work
second
only
to
the
conquest
of
england
he
won
the
city
of
le
mans
and
the
whole
land
of
maine
between
the
tale
of
maine
and
the
tale
of
england
there
is
much
of
direct
likeness
both
lands
were
won
against
the
will
of
their
inhabitants
but
both
conquests
were
made
with
an
elaborate
show
of
legal
right
earlier
conquests
in
maine
had
been
won
not
from
any
count
of
maine
but
from
geoffrey
of
anjou
who
had
occupied
the
country
to
the
prejudice
of
two
successive
counts
hugh
and
herbert
he
had
further
imprisoned
the
bishop
of
le
mans
gervase
of
the
house
of
bellême
though
the
king
of
the
french
had
at
his
request
granted
to
the
count
of
anjou
for
life
royal
rights
over
the
bishopric
of
le
mans
the
bishops
of
le
mans
who
thus
unlike
the
bishops
of
normandy
held
their
temporalities
of
the
distant
king
and
not
of
the
local
count
held
a
very
independent
position
the
citizens
of
le
mans
too
had
large
privileges
and
a
high
spirit
to
defend
them
the
city
was
in
a
marked
way
the
head
of
the
district
thus
it
commonly
carried
with
it
the
action
of
the
whole
country
in
maine
there
were
three
rival
powers
the
prince
the
church
and
the
people
the
position
of
the
counts
was
further
weakened
by
the
claims
to
their
homage
made
by
the
princes
on
either
side
of
them
in
normandy
and
anjou
the
position
of
the
bishop
vassal
till
late
act
of
the
king
only
was
really
a
higher
one
geoffrey
had
been
received
at
le
mans
with
the
good
will
of
the
citizens
and
both
bishop
and
count
sought
shelter
with
william
gervase
was
removed
from
the
strife
by
promotion
to
the
highest
place
in
the
french
kingdom
the
archbishopric
of
rheims
the
young
count
herbert
driven
from
his
county
commended
himself
to
william
he
became
his
man
he
agreed
to
hold
his
dominions
of
him
and
to
marry
one
of
his
daughters
if
he
died
childless
his
was
to
take
the
fief
into
his
own
hands
but
to
unite
the
old
and
new
dynasties
youngest
sister
margaret
was
to
marry
eldest
son
robert
if
female
descent
went
for
anything
it
is
not
clear
why
herbert
passed
by
the
rights
of
his
two
elder
sisters
gersendis
wife
of
azo
marquess
of
liguria
and
paula
wife
of
john
of
la
flèche
on
the
borders
of
maine
and
anjou
and
sons
both
of
gersendis
and
of
paula
did
actually
reign
at
le
mans
while
no
child
either
of
herbert
or
of
margaret
ever
came
into
being
if
herbert
ever
actually
got
possession
of
his
country
his
possession
of
it
was
short
he
died
in
before
either
of
the
contemplated
marriages
had
been
carried
out
william
therefore
stood
towards
maine
as
he
expected
to
stand
with
regard
to
england
the
sovereign
of
each
country
had
made
a
formal
settlement
of
his
dominions
in
his
favour
it
was
to
be
seen
whether
those
who
were
most
immediately
concerned
would
accept
that
settlement
was
the
rule
either
of
maine
or
of
england
to
be
handed
over
in
this
way
like
a
mere
property
without
the
people
who
were
to
be
ruled
speaking
their
minds
on
the
matter
what
the
people
of
england
said
to
this
question
in
we
shall
hear
presently
what
the
people
of
maine
said
in
we
hear
now
we
know
not
why
they
had
submitted
to
the
angevin
count
they
had
now
no
mind
to
merge
their
country
in
the
dominions
of
the
norman
duke
the
bishop
was
neutral
but
the
nobles
and
the
citizens
of
le
mans
were
of
one
mind
in
refusing
demand
to
be
received
as
count
by
virtue
of
the
agreement
with
herbert
they
chose
rulers
for
themselves
passing
by
gersendis
and
paula
and
their
sons
they
sent
for
aunt
biota
and
her
husband
walter
count
of
mantes
strangely
enough
walter
son
of
godgifu
daughter
of
æthelred
was
a
possible
though
not
a
likely
candidate
for
the
rule
of
england
as
well
as
of
maine
the
people
of
maine
are
not
likely
to
have
thought
of
this
bit
of
genealogy
but
it
was
doubtless
present
to
the
minds
alike
of
william
and
of
harold
william
thus
for
the
first
but
not
for
the
last
time
claimed
the
rule
of
a
people
who
had
no
mind
to
have
him
as
their
ruler
yet
morally
worthless
as
were
his
claims
over
maine
in
the
merely
technical
way
of
looking
at
things
he
had
more
to
say
than
most
princes
have
who
annex
the
lands
of
their
neighbours
he
had
a
perfectly
good
right
by
the
terms
of
the
agreement
with
herbert
and
it
might
be
argued
by
any
who
admitted
the
norman
claim
to
the
homage
of
maine
that
on
the
failure
of
male
heirs
the
country
reverted
to
the
overlord
yet
female
succession
was
now
coming
in
anjou
had
passed
to
the
sons
of
sister
it
had
not
fallen
back
to
the
french
king
there
was
thus
a
twofold
answer
to
claim
that
herbert
could
not
grant
away
even
the
rights
of
his
sisters
still
less
the
rights
of
his
people
still
it
was
characteristic
of
william
that
he
had
a
case
that
might
be
plausibly
argued
the
people
of
maine
had
fallen
back
on
the
old
teutonic
right
they
had
chosen
a
prince
connected
with
the
old
stock
but
who
was
not
the
next
heir
according
to
any
rule
of
succession
walter
was
hardly
worthy
of
such
an
exceptional
honour
he
showed
no
more
energy
in
maine
than
his
brother
ralph
had
shown
in
england
the
city
was
defended
by
geoffrey
lord
of
mayenne
a
valiant
man
who
fills
a
large
place
in
the
local
history
but
no
valour
or
skill
could
withstand
plan
of
warfare
he
invaded
maine
in
much
the
same
sort
in
which
he
had
defended
normandy
he
gave
out
that
he
wished
to
win
maine
without
shedding
blood
he
fought
no
battles
he
did
not
attack
the
city
which
he
left
to
be
the
last
spot
that
should
be
devoured
he
harried
the
open
country
he
occupied
the
smaller
posts
till
the
citizens
were
driven
against
will
to
surrender
william
entered
le
mans
he
was
received
we
are
told
with
joy
when
men
make
the
best
of
a
bad
bargain
they
sometimes
persuade
themselves
that
they
are
really
pleased
william
as
ever
shed
no
blood
he
harmed
none
of
the
men
who
had
become
his
subjects
but
le
mans
was
to
be
bridled
its
citizens
needed
a
castle
and
a
norman
garrison
to
keep
them
in
their
new
allegiance
walter
and
biota
surrendered
their
claims
on
maine
and
became
guests
at
falaise
meanwhile
geoffrey
of
mayenne
refused
to
submit
and
withstood
the
new
count
of
maine
in
his
stronghold
william
laid
siege
to
mayenne
and
took
it
by
the
favoured
norman
argument
of
fire
all
maine
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
conqueror
william
had
now
made
a
greater
conquest
than
any
norman
duke
had
made
before
him
he
had
won
a
county
and
a
noble
city
and
he
had
won
them
in
the
ideas
of
his
own
age
with
honour
are
we
to
believe
that
he
sullied
his
conquest
by
putting
his
late
competitors
his
present
guests
to
death
by
poison
they
died
conveniently
for
him
and
they
died
in
his
own
house
such
a
death
was
strange
but
strange
things
do
happen
william
gradually
came
to
shrink
from
no
crime
for
which
he
could
find
a
technical
defence
but
no
advocate
could
have
said
anything
on
behalf
of
the
poisoning
of
walter
and
biota
another
member
of
the
house
of
maine
margaret
the
betrothed
of
his
son
robert
died
about
the
same
time
and
her
at
least
william
had
every
motive
to
keep
alive
one
who
was
more
dangerous
than
walter
if
he
suffered
anything
only
suffered
banishment
of
geoffrey
of
mayenne
we
hear
no
more
till
william
had
again
to
fight
for
the
possession
of
maine
william
had
thus
in
the
year
reached
the
height
of
his
power
and
fame
as
a
continental
prince
in
a
conquest
on
gaulish
soil
he
had
rehearsed
the
greater
conquest
which
he
was
before
long
to
make
beyond
sea
three
years
eventful
in
england
outwardly
uneventful
in
normandy
still
part
us
from
second
visit
to
our
shores
but
in
the
course
of
these
three
years
one
event
must
have
happened
which
without
a
blow
being
struck
or
a
treaty
being
signed
did
more
for
his
hopes
than
any
battle
or
any
treaty
at
some
unrecorded
time
but
at
a
time
which
must
come
within
these
years
harold
earl
of
the
became
the
guest
and
the
man
of
william
duke
of
the
normans
chapter
oath
to
william
the
lord
of
normandy
and
maine
could
now
stop
and
reckon
his
chances
of
becoming
lord
of
england
also
while
our
authorities
enable
us
to
put
together
a
fairly
full
account
of
both
norman
and
english
events
they
throw
no
light
on
the
way
in
which
men
in
either
land
looked
at
events
in
the
other
yet
we
might
give
much
to
know
what
william
and
harold
at
this
time
thought
of
one
another
nothing
had
as
yet
happened
to
make
the
two
great
rivals
either
national
or
personal
enemies
england
and
normandy
were
at
peace
and
the
great
duke
and
the
great
earl
had
most
likely
had
no
personal
dealings
with
one
another
they
were
rivals
in
the
sense
that
each
looked
forward
to
succeed
to
the
english
crown
whenever
the
reigning
king
should
die
but
neither
had
as
yet
put
forward
his
claim
in
any
shape
that
the
other
could
look
on
as
any
formal
wrong
to
himself
if
william
and
harold
had
ever
met
it
could
have
been
only
during
journey
in
gaul
whatever
negotiations
harold
made
during
that
journey
were
negotiations
unfriendly
to
william
still
he
may
in
the
course
of
that
journey
have
visited
normandy
as
well
as
france
or
anjou
it
is
hard
to
avoid
the
thought
that
the
tale
of
visit
to
william
of
his
oath
to
william
arose
out
of
something
that
happened
on
way
back
from
his
roman
pilgrimage
to
that
journey
we
can
give
an
approximate
date
of
any
other
journey
we
have
no
date
and
no
certain
detail
we
can
say
only
that
the
fact
that
no
english
writer
makes
any
mention
of
any
such
visit
of
any
such
oath
is
under
the
circumstances
the
strongest
proof
that
the
story
of
the
visit
and
the
oath
has
some
kind
of
foundation
yet
if
we
grant
thus
much
the
story
reads
on
the
whole
as
if
it
happened
a
few
years
later
than
the
english
return
from
rome
it
is
therefore
most
likely
that
harold
did
pay
a
second
visit
to
gaul
whether
a
first
or
a
second
visit
to
normandy
at
some
time
nearer
to
death
than
the
year
the
english
writers
are
silent
the
norman
writers
give
no
date
or
impossible
dates
they
connect
the
visit
with
a
war
in
britanny
but
that
war
is
without
a
date
we
are
driven
to
choose
the
year
which
is
least
rich
in
events
in
the
english
annals
harold
could
not
have
paid
a
visit
of
several
months
to
normandy
either
in
or
in
of
those
years
the
first
was
the
year
of
great
war
in
wales
when
he
found
how
the
britons
might
be
overcome
by
their
own
arms
when
he
broke
the
power
of
gruffydd
and
granted
the
welsh
kingdom
to
princes
who
became
the
men
of
earl
harold
as
well
as
of
king
edward
visit
to
normandy
is
said
to
have
taken
place
in
the
summer
and
autumn
mouths
but
the
summer
and
autumn
of
were
taken
up
by
the
building
and
destruction
of
in
wales
and
by
the
greater
events
of
the
revolt
and
pacification
of
northumberland
but
the
year
is
a
blank
in
the
english
annals
till
the
last
days
of
december
and
no
action
of
in
that
year
is
recorded
it
is
therefore
the
only
possible
year
among
those
just
before
death
visit
and
oath
to
william
may
very
well
have
taken
place
in
that
year
but
that
is
all
we
know
as
little
for
certain
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
visit
or
the
nature
of
the
oath
we
can
say
only
that
harold
did
something
which
enabled
william
to
charge
him
with
perjury
and
breach
of
the
duty
of
a
vassal
it
is
inconceivable
in
itself
and
unlike
the
formal
scrupulousness
of
character
to
fancy
that
he
made
his
appeal
to
all
christendom
without
any
ground
at
all
the
norman
writers
contradict
one
another
so
thoroughly
in
every
detail
of
the
story
that
we
can
look
on
no
part
of
it
as
trustworthy
yet
such
a
story
can
hardly
have
grown
up
so
near
to
the
alleged
time
without
some
kernel
of
truth
in
it
and
herein
comes
the
strong
corroborative
witness
that
the
english
writers
denying
every
other
charge
against
harold
pass
this
one
by
without
notice
we
can
hardly
doubt
that
harold
swore
some
oath
to
william
which
he
did
not
keep
more
than
this
it
would
be
rash
to
say
except
as
an
avowed
guess
as
our
nearest
approach
to
fixing
the
date
is
to
take
that
year
which
is
not
impossible
so
to
fix
the
occasion
of
the
visit
we
can
only
take
that
one
among
the
norman
versions
which
is
also
not
impossible
all
the
main
versions
represent
harold
as
wrecked
on
the
coast
of
ponthieu
as
imprisoned
according
to
the
barbarous
law
of
wreck
by
count
guy
and
as
delivered
by
the
intervention
of
william
if
any
part
of
the
story
is
true
this
is
but
as
to
the
circumstances
which
led
to
the
shipwreck
there
is
no
agreement
harold
assuredly
was
not
sent
to
announce
to
william
a
devise
of
the
crown
in
his
favour
made
with
the
consent
of
the
witan
of
england
and
confirmed
by
the
oaths
of
stigand
godwine
siward
and
leofric
stigand
became
archbishop
in
september
godwine
died
at
easter
the
devise
must
therefore
have
taken
place
and
journey
must
have
taken
place
within
those
few
most
unlikely
months
the
very
time
when
norman
influence
was
overthrown
another
version
makes
harold
go
against
the
warnings
to
bring
back
his
brother
wulfnoth
and
his
nephew
hakon
who
had
been
given
as
hostages
on
the
return
of
godwine
and
had
been
entrusted
by
the
king
to
the
keeping
of
duke
william
this
version
is
one
degree
less
absurd
but
no
such
hostages
are
known
to
have
been
given
and
if
they
were
the
patriotic
party
in
the
full
swing
of
triumph
would
hardly
have
allowed
them
to
be
sent
to
normandy
a
third
version
makes
presence
the
result
of
mere
accident
he
is
sailing
to
wales
or
flanders
or
simply
taking
his
pleasure
in
the
channel
when
he
is
cast
by
a
storm
on
the
coast
of
ponthieu
of
these
three
accounts
we
may
choose
the
third
as
the
only
one
that
is
possible
it
is
also
one
out
of
which
the
others
may
have
grown
while
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
third
could
have
arisen
out
of
either
of
the
others
harold
then
we
may
suppose
fell
accidentally
into
the
clutches
of
guy
and
was
rescued
from
them
at
some
cost
in
ransom
and
in
grants
of
land
by
overlord
duke
william
the
whole
story
is
eminently
characteristic
of
william
he
would
be
honestly
indignant
at
base
treatment
of
harold
and
he
would
feel
it
his
part
as
overlord
to
redress
the
wrong
but
he
would
also
be
alive
to
the
advantage
of
getting
his
rival
into
his
power
on
so
honourable
a
pretext
simply
to
establish
a
claim
to
gratitude
on
the
part
of
harold
would
be
something
but
he
might
easily
do
more
and
according
to
all
accounts
he
did
more
harold
we
are
told
as
the
friend
and
guest
returns
the
obligation
under
which
the
duke
has
laid
him
by
joining
him
in
one
or
more
expeditions
against
the
bretons
the
man
who
had
just
smitten
the
of
the
island
might
well
be
asked
to
fight
and
might
well
be
ready
to
fight
against
the
of
the
mainland
the
services
of
harold
won
him
high
honour
he
was
admitted
into
the
ranks
of
norman
knighthood
and
engaged
to
marry
one
of
daughters
now
at
any
time
to
which
we
can
fix
visit
all
daughters
must
have
been
mere
children
harold
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
have
been
a
little
older
than
william
yet
there
is
nothing
unlikely
in
the
engagement
and
it
is
the
one
point
in
which
all
the
different
versions
contradicting
each
other
on
every
other
point
agree
without
exception
whatever
else
harold
promises
he
promises
this
and
in
some
versions
he
does
not
promise
anything
else
here
then
we
surely
have
the
kernel
of
truth
round
which
a
mass
of
fable
varying
in
different
reports
has
gathered
on
no
other
point
is
there
any
agreement
the
place
is
unfixed
half
a
dozen
norman
towns
and
castles
are
made
the
scene
of
the
oath
the
form
of
the
oath
is
unfixed
in
some
accounts
it
is
the
ordinary
oath
of
homage
in
others
it
is
an
oath
of
fearful
solemnity
taken
on
the
holiest
relics
in
one
account
harold
is
even
made
to
swear
on
hidden
relics
not
knowing
on
what
he
is
swearing
here
is
matter
for
much
thought
to
hold
that
one
form
of
oath
or
promise
is
more
binding
than
another
upsets
all
true
confidence
between
man
and
man
the
notion
of
the
specially
binding
nature
of
the
oath
by
relies
assumes
that
in
case
of
breach
of
the
oath
every
holy
person
to
whose
relies
despite
has
been
done
will
become
the
personal
enemy
of
the
perjurer
but
the
last
story
of
all
is
the
most
instructive
formal
and
more
than
formal
religion
abhorred
a
false
oath
in
himself
or
in
another
man
but
so
long
as
he
keeps
himself
personally
clear
from
the
guilt
he
does
not
scruple
to
put
another
man
under
special
temptation
and
while
believing
in
the
power
of
the
holy
relics
he
does
not
scruple
to
abuse
them
to
a
purpose
of
fraud
surely
if
harold
did
break
his
oath
the
wrath
of
the
saints
would
fall
more
justly
on
william
whether
the
tale
be
true
or
false
it
equally
illustrates
the
feelings
of
the
time
and
assuredly
its
truth
or
falsehood
concerns
the
character
of
william
far
more
than
that
of
harold
what
it
was
that
harold
swore
whether
in
this
specially
solemn
fashion
or
in
any
other
is
left
equally
uncertain
in
any
case
he
engages
to
marry
a
daughter
of
to
which
daughter
the
statements
are
in
most
versions
he
engages
to
do
something
more
he
becomes
the
man
of
william
much
as
william
had
become
the
man
of
edward
he
promises
to
give
his
sister
in
marriage
to
an
unnamed
norman
baron
moreover
he
promises
to
secure
the
kingdom
of
england
for
william
at
death
perhaps
he
is
himself
to
hold
the
kingdom
or
part
of
it
under
william
in
any
case
william
is
to
be
the
overlord
in
the
more
usual
story
william
is
to
be
himself
the
immediate
king
with
harold
as
his
highest
and
most
favoured
subject
meanwhile
harold
is
to
act
in
interest
to
receive
a
norman
garrison
in
dover
castle
and
to
build
other
castles
at
other
points
but
no
two
stories
agree
and
not
a
few
know
nothing
of
anything
beyond
the
promise
of
marriage
now
if
william
really
required
harold
to
swear
to
all
these
things
it
must
have
been
simply
in
order
to
have
an
occasion
against
him
if
harold
really
swore
to
all
of
them
it
must
have
been
simply
because
he
felt
that
he
was
practically
in
power
without
any
serious
intention
of
keeping
the
oath
if
harold
took
any
such
oath
he
undoubtedly
broke
it
but
we
may
safely
say
that
any
guilt
on
his
part
lay
wholly
in
taking
the
oath
not
in
breaking
it
for
he
swore
to
do
what
he
could
not
do
and
what
it
would
have
been
a
crime
to
do
if
he
could
if
the
king
himself
could
not
dispose
of
the
crown
still
less
could
the
most
powerful
subject
harold
could
at
most
promise
william
his
and
interest
whenever
the
election
came
but
no
one
can
believe
that
even
influence
could
have
obtained
the
crown
for
william
his
influence
lay
in
his
being
the
embodiment
of
the
national
feeling
for
him
to
appear
as
the
supporter
of
william
would
have
been
to
lose
the
crown
for
himself
without
gaining
it
for
william
others
in
england
and
in
scandinavia
would
have
been
glad
of
it
and
the
engagements
to
surrender
dover
castle
and
the
like
were
simply
engagements
on
the
part
of
an
english
earl
to
play
the
traitor
against
england
if
william
really
called
on
harold
to
swear
to
all
this
he
did
so
not
with
any
hope
that
the
oath
would
be
kept
but
simply
to
put
his
competitor
as
far
as
possible
in
the
wrong
but
most
likely
harold
swore
only
to
something
much
simpler
next
to
the
universal
agreement
about
the
marriage
comes
the
very
general
agreement
that
harold
became
man
in
these
two
statements
we
have
probably
the
whole
truth
in
those
days
men
took
the
obligation
of
homage
upon
themselves
very
easily
homage
was
no
degradation
even
in
the
highest
a
man
often
did
homage
to
any
one
from
whom
he
had
received
any
great
benefit
and
harold
had
received
a
very
great
benefit
from
william
nor
did
homage
to
a
new
lord
imply
treason
to
the
old
one
harold
delivered
by
william
from
dungeon
would
be
eager
to
do
for
william
any
act
of
friendship
the
homage
would
be
little
more
than
binding
himself
in
the
strongest
form
so
to
do
the
relation
of
homage
could
be
made
to
mean
anything
or
nothing
as
might
be
convenient
the
man
might
often
understand
it
in
one
sense
and
the
lord
in
another
if
harold
became
the
man
of
william
he
would
look
on
the
act
as
little
more
than
an
expression
of
good
will
and
gratitude
towards
his
benefactor
his
future
his
commander
in
the
breton
war
he
would
not
look
on
it
as
forbidding
him
to
accept
the
english
crown
if
it
were
offered
to
him
harold
the
man
of
duke
william
might
become
a
king
if
he
could
just
as
william
the
man
of
king
philip
might
become
a
king
if
he
could
as
things
went
in
those
days
both
the
homage
and
the
promise
of
marriage
were
capable
of
being
looked
on
very
lightly
but
it
was
not
in
the
temper
or
in
the
circumstances
of
william
to
put
any
such
easy
meaning
on
either
promise
the
oath
might
if
needful
be
construed
very
strictly
and
william
was
disposed
to
construe
it
very
strictly
harold
had
not
promised
william
a
crown
which
was
not
his
to
promise
but
he
had
promised
to
do
that
which
might
be
held
to
forbid
him
to
take
a
crown
which
william
held
to
be
his
own
if
the
man
owed
his
lord
any
duty
at
all
it
was
surely
his
duty
not
to
thwart
his
wishes
in
such
a
matter
if
therefore
when
the
vacancy
of
the
throne
came
harold
took
the
crown
himself
or
even
failed
to
promote
claim
to
it
william
might
argue
that
he
had
not
rightly
discharged
the
duty
of
a
man
to
his
lord
he
could
make
an
appeal
to
the
world
against
the
new
king
as
a
perjured
man
who
had
failed
to
help
his
lord
in
the
matter
where
his
lord
most
needed
his
help
and
if
the
oath
really
had
been
taken
on
relics
of
special
holiness
he
could
further
appeal
to
the
religious
feelings
of
the
time
against
the
man
who
had
done
despite
to
the
saints
if
he
should
be
driven
to
claim
the
crown
by
arms
he
could
give
the
war
the
character
of
a
crusade
all
this
in
the
end
william
did
and
all
this
we
may
be
sure
he
looked
forward
to
doing
when
he
caused
harold
to
become
his
man
the
mere
obligation
of
homage
would
in
the
skilful
hands
of
william
and
lanfranc
be
quite
enough
to
work
on
minds
as
william
wished
to
work
on
them
to
harold
meanwhile
and
to
those
in
england
who
heard
the
story
the
engagement
would
not
seem
to
carry
any
of
these
consequences
the
mere
homage
then
which
harold
could
hardly
refuse
would
answer
purpose
nearly
as
well
as
any
of
these
fuller
obligations
which
harold
would
surely
have
refused
and
when
a
man
older
than
william
engaged
to
marry
we
must
bear
in
mind
the
lightness
with
which
such
promises
were
made
william
could
not
seriously
expect
that
this
engagement
would
be
kept
if
anything
should
lead
harold
to
another
marriage
the
promise
was
meant
simply
to
add
another
count
to
the
charges
against
harold
when
the
time
should
come
yet
on
this
point
it
is
not
clear
that
the
oath
was
broken
harold
undoubtedly
married
ealdgyth
daughter
of
ælfgar
and
widow
of
gruffydd
and
not
any
daughter
of
william
but
in
one
version
harold
is
made
to
say
that
the
daughter
of
william
whom
he
had
engaged
to
marry
was
dead
and
that
one
of
daughters
did
die
very
early
there
seems
little
doubt
whatever
william
did
lanfranc
no
doubt
at
least
helped
to
plan
the
norman
duke
was
subtle
but
the
italian
churchman
was
subtler
still
in
this
long
series
of
schemes
and
negotiations
which
led
to
the
conquest
of
england
we
are
dealing
with
two
of
the
greatest
recorded
masters
of
statecraft
we
may
call
their
policy
dishonest
and
immoral
and
so
it
was
but
it
was
hardly
more
dishonest
and
immoral
than
most
of
the
diplomacy
of
later
times
object
was
without
any
formal
breach
of
faith
on
his
own
part
to
entrap
harold
into
an
engagement
which
might
be
understood
in
different
senses
and
which
in
the
sense
which
william
chose
to
put
upon
it
harold
was
sure
to
break
two
men
themselves
of
virtuous
life
a
rigid
churchman
and
a
layman
of
unusual
religious
strictness
do
not
scruple
to
throw
temptation
in
the
way
of
a
fellow
man
in
the
hope
that
he
will
yield
to
that
temptation
they
exact
a
promise
because
the
promise
is
likely
to
be
broken
and
because
its
breach
would
suit
their
purposes
through
all
policy
a
strong
regard
for
formal
right
as
he
chose
to
understand
formal
right
is
not
only
found
in
company
with
much
practical
wrong
but
is
made
the
direct
instrument
of
carrying
out
that
wrong
never
was
trap
more
cunningly
laid
than
that
in
which
william
now
entangled
harold
never
was
greater
wrong
done
without
the
breach
of
any
formal
precept
of
right
william
and
lanfranc
broke
no
oath
themselves
and
that
was
enough
for
them
but
it
was
no
sin
in
their
eyes
to
beguile
another
into
engagements
which
he
would
understand
in
one
way
and
they
in
another
they
even
as
their
admirers
tell
the
story
beguile
him
into
engagements
at
once
unlawful
and
impossible
because
their
interests
would
be
promoted
by
his
breach
of
those
engagements
william
in
short
under
the
spiritual
guidance
of
lanfranc
made
harold
swear
because
he
himself
would
gain
by
being
able
to
denounce
harold
as
perjured
the
moral
question
need
not
be
further
discussed
but
we
should
greatly
like
to
know
how
far
the
fact
of
oath
whatever
its
nature
was
known
in
england
on
this
point
we
have
no
trustworthy
authority
the
english
writers
say
nothing
about
the
whole
matter
to
the
norman
writers
this
point
was
of
no
interest
no
one
mentions
this
point
except
romantic
biographer
at
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
century
his
statements
are
of
no
value
except
as
showing
how
long
memory
was
cherished
according
to
him
harold
formally
laid
the
matter
before
the
witan
and
they
unanimously
voted
that
the
in
his
version
than
a
mere
oath
of
not
binding
it
is
not
likely
that
such
a
vote
was
ever
formally
passed
but
its
terms
would
only
express
what
every
englishman
would
feel
the
oath
whatever
its
terms
had
given
william
a
great
advantage
but
every
englishman
would
argue
both
that
the
oath
whatever
its
terms
could
not
hinder
the
english
nation
from
offering
harold
the
crown
and
that
it
could
not
bind
harold
to
refuse
the
crown
if
it
should
be
so
offered
chapter
vi
the
negotiations
of
duke
william
if
the
time
that
has
been
suggested
was
the
real
time
of
oath
to
william
its
fulfilment
became
a
practical
question
in
little
more
than
a
year
how
the
year
passed
in
normandy
we
have
no
record
in
england
its
later
months
saw
the
revolt
of
northumberland
against
brother
tostig
and
the
reconciliation
which
harold
made
between
the
revolters
and
the
king
to
the
damage
of
his
interests
then
came
sickness
of
which
he
died
on
january
he
had
on
his
deathbed
recommended
harold
to
the
assembled
witan
as
his
successor
in
the
kingdom
the
candidate
was
at
once
elected
whether
william
edgar
or
any
other
was
spoken
of
we
know
not
but
as
to
the
recommendation
of
edward
and
the
consequent
election
of
harold
the
english
writers
are
express
the
next
day
edward
was
buried
and
harold
was
crowned
in
regular
form
by
ealdred
archbishop
of
york
in
new
church
at
westminster
northumberland
refused
to
acknowledge
him
but
the
malcontents
were
won
over
by
the
coming
of
the
king
and
his
friend
saint
wulfstan
bishop
of
worcester
it
was
most
likely
now
as
a
seal
of
this
reconciliation
that
harold
married
ealdgyth
the
sister
of
the
two
northern
earls
edwin
and
morkere
and
the
widow
of
the
welsh
king
gruffydd
he
doubtless
hoped
in
this
way
to
win
the
loyalty
of
the
earls
and
their
followers
the
accession
of
harold
was
perfectly
regular
according
to
english
law
in
later
times
endless
fables
arose
but
the
norman
writers
of
the
time
do
not
deny
the
facts
of
the
recommendation
election
and
coronation
they
slur
them
over
or
while
admitting
the
mere
facts
they
represent
each
act
as
in
some
way
invalid
no
writer
near
the
time
asserts
a
deathbed
nomination
of
william
they
speak
only
of
a
nomination
at
some
earlier
time
but
some
norman
writers
represent
harold
as
crowned
by
stigand
archbishop
of
canterbury
this
was
not
in
the
ideas
of
those
times
a
trifling
question
a
coronation
was
then
not
a
mere
pageant
it
was
the
actual
admission
to
the
kingly
office
till
his
crowning
and
anointing
the
claimant
of
the
crown
was
like
a
before
his
consecration
he
had
by
birth
or
election
the
sole
right
to
become
king
it
was
the
coronation
that
made
him
king
and
as
the
ceremony
took
the
form
of
an
ecclesiastical
sacrament
its
validity
might
seem
to
depend
on
the
lawful
position
of
the
officiating
bishop
in
england
to
perform
that
ceremony
was
the
right
and
duty
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
but
the
canonical
position
of
stigand
was
doubtful
he
had
been
appointed
on
the
flight
of
robert
he
had
received
the
the
badge
of
rank
only
from
the
usurping
benedict
the
tenth
it
was
therefore
good
policy
in
harold
to
be
crowned
by
ealdred
to
whose
position
there
was
no
objection
this
is
the
only
difference
of
fact
between
the
english
and
norman
versions
at
this
stage
and
the
difference
is
easily
explained
at
coronation
the
king
walked
to
the
altar
between
the
two
archbishops
but
it
was
ealdred
who
actually
performed
the
ceremony
coronation
doubtless
followed
the
same
order
but
if
stigand
took
any
part
in
that
coronation
it
was
easy
to
give
out
that
he
took
that
special
part
on
which
the
validity
of
the
rite
depended
still
if
accession
was
perfectly
lawful
it
was
none
the
less
strange
and
unusual
except
the
danish
kings
chosen
under
more
or
less
of
compulsion
he
was
the
first
king
who
did
not
belong
to
the
kingly
house
such
a
choice
could
be
justified
only
on
the
ground
that
that
house
contained
no
qualified
candidate
its
only
known
members
were
the
children
of
the
ætheling
edward
young
edgar
and
his
sisters
now
edgar
would
certainly
have
been
passed
by
in
favour
of
any
better
qualified
member
of
the
kingly
house
as
his
father
had
been
passed
by
in
favour
of
king
edward
and
the
same
principle
would
as
things
stood
justify
passing
him
by
in
favour
of
a
qualified
candidate
not
of
the
kingly
house
but
right
to
the
crown
is
never
spoken
of
till
a
generation
or
two
later
when
the
doctrines
of
hereditary
right
had
gained
much
greater
strength
and
when
henry
the
second
through
his
mother
of
sister
margaret
insisted
on
his
descent
from
the
old
kings
this
distinction
is
important
because
harold
is
often
called
an
usurper
as
keeping
out
edgar
the
heir
by
birth
but
those
who
called
him
an
usurper
at
the
time
called
him
so
as
keeping
out
william
the
heir
by
bequest
own
election
was
out
of
the
question
he
was
no
more
of
the
english
kingly
house
than
harold
he
was
a
foreigner
and
an
utter
stranger
had
englishmen
been
minded
to
choose
a
foreigner
they
doubtless
would
have
chosen
swegen
of
denmark
he
had
found
supporters
when
edward
was
chosen
he
was
afterwards
appealed
to
to
deliver
england
from
william
he
was
no
more
of
the
english
kingly
house
than
harold
or
william
but
he
was
grandson
of
a
man
who
had
reigned
over
england
northumberland
might
have
preferred
him
to
harold
any
part
of
england
would
have
preferred
him
to
william
in
fact
any
choice
that
could
have
been
made
must
have
had
something
strange
about
it
edgar
himself
the
one
surviving
male
of
the
old
stock
besides
his
youth
was
neither
born
in
the
land
nor
the
son
of
a
crowned
king
those
two
qualifications
had
always
been
deemed
of
great
moment
an
elaborate
pedigree
went
for
little
actual
royal
birth
went
for
a
great
deal
there
was
now
no
son
of
a
king
to
choose
had
there
been
even
a
child
who
was
at
once
a
son
of
edward
and
a
son
of
harold
he
might
have
reigned
with
his
uncle
as
his
guardian
and
counsellor
as
it
was
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
choose
the
man
who
though
not
of
kingly
blood
had
ruled
england
well
for
thirteen
years
the
case
thus
put
seemed
plain
to
every
englishman
at
all
events
to
every
man
in
wessex
and
southern
mercia
but
it
would
not
seem
so
plain
in
lands
to
the
greater
part
of
western
europe
claim
might
really
seem
the
better
william
himself
doubtless
thought
his
own
claim
the
better
he
deluded
himself
as
he
deluded
others
but
we
are
more
concerned
with
william
as
a
statesman
and
if
it
be
statesmanship
to
adapt
means
to
ends
whatever
the
ends
may
be
if
it
be
statesmanship
to
make
men
believe
that
the
worse
cause
is
the
better
then
no
man
ever
showed
higher
statesmanship
than
william
showed
in
his
great
pleading
before
all
western
christendom
it
is
a
sign
of
the
times
that
it
was
a
pleading
before
all
western
christendom
others
had
claimed
crowns
none
had
taken
such
pains
to
convince
all
mankind
that
the
claim
was
a
good
one
such
an
appeal
to
public
opinion
marks
on
one
side
a
great
advance
it
was
a
great
step
towards
the
ideas
of
international
law
and
even
of
european
concert
it
showed
that
the
days
of
mere
force
were
over
that
the
days
of
subtle
diplomacy
had
begun
possibly
the
change
was
not
without
its
dark
side
it
may
be
doubted
whether
a
change
from
force
to
fraud
is
wholly
a
gain
still
it
was
an
appeal
from
the
mere
argument
of
the
sword
to
something
which
at
least
professed
to
be
right
and
reason
william
does
not
draw
the
sword
till
he
has
convinced
himself
and
everybody
else
that
he
is
drawing
it
in
a
just
cause
in
that
age
the
appeal
naturally
took
a
religious
shape
herein
lay
its
immediate
strength
herein
lay
its
weakness
as
regarded
the
times
to
come
william
appealed
to
emperor
kings
princes
christian
men
great
and
small
in
every
christian
land
he
would
persuade
all
he
would
ask
help
of
all
but
above
all
he
appealed
to
the
head
of
christendom
the
bishop
of
rome
william
in
his
own
person
could
afford
to
do
so
where
he
reigned
in
normandy
or
in
england
there
was
no
fear
of
roman
encroachments
he
was
fully
minded
to
be
in
all
causes
and
over
all
persons
within
his
dominions
supreme
while
he
lived
no
pope
ventured
to
dispute
his
right
but
by
acknowledging
the
right
of
the
pope
to
dispose
of
crowns
or
at
least
to
judge
as
to
the
right
to
crowns
he
prepared
many
days
of
humiliation
for
kings
in
general
and
specially
for
his
own
successors
one
man
in
western
europe
could
see
further
than
william
perhaps
even
further
than
lanfranc
the
chief
counsellor
of
pope
alexander
the
second
was
the
archdeacon
hildebrand
the
future
gregory
the
seventh
if
william
outwitted
the
world
hildebrand
outwitted
william
appeal
to
the
pope
to
decide
between
two
claimants
for
the
english
crown
strengthened
gregory
not
a
little
in
his
daring
claim
to
dispose
of
the
crowns
of
rome
of
italy
and
of
germany
still
this
recognition
of
roman
claims
led
more
directly
to
the
humiliation
of
successor
in
his
own
kingdom
moreover
successful
attempt
to
represent
his
enterprise
as
a
holy
war
a
crusade
before
crusades
were
heard
of
did
much
to
suggest
and
to
make
ready
the
way
for
the
real
crusades
a
generation
later
it
was
not
till
after
death
that
urban
preached
the
crusade
but
it
was
during
life
that
gregory
planned
it
the
appeal
was
strangely
successful
william
convinced
or
seemed
to
convince
all
men
out
of
england
and
scandinavia
that
his
claim
to
the
english
crown
was
just
and
holy
and
that
it
was
a
good
work
to
help
him
to
assert
it
in
arms
he
persuaded
his
own
subjects
he
certainly
did
not
constrain
them
he
persuaded
some
foreign
princes
to
give
him
actual
help
some
to
join
his
muster
in
person
he
persuaded
all
to
help
him
so
far
as
not
to
hinder
their
subjects
from
joining
him
as
volunteers
and
all
this
was
done
by
sheer
persuasion
by
argument
good
or
bad
in
adapting
of
means
to
ends
in
applying
to
each
class
of
men
that
kind
of
argument
which
best
suited
it
the
diplomacy
the
statesmanship
of
william
was
perfect
again
we
ask
how
far
was
it
the
statesmanship
of
william
how
far
of
lanfranc
but
a
prince
need
not
do
everything
with
his
own
hands
and
say
everything
with
his
own
tongue
it
was
no
small
part
of
the
statesmanship
of
william
to
find
out
lanfranc
to
appreciate
him
and
to
trust
him
and
when
two
subtle
brains
were
at
work
more
could
be
done
by
the
two
working
in
partnership
than
by
either
working
alone
by
what
arguments
did
the
duke
of
the
normans
and
the
prior
of
bec
convince
mankind
that
the
worse
cause
was
the
better
we
must
always
remember
the
transitional
character
of
the
age
england
was
in
political
matters
in
advance
of
other
western
lands
that
is
it
lagged
behind
other
western
lands
it
had
not
gone
so
far
on
the
downward
course
it
kept
far
more
than
gaul
or
even
germany
of
the
old
teutonic
institutions
the
substance
of
which
later
ages
have
won
back
under
new
shapes
many
things
were
understood
in
england
which
are
now
again
understood
everywhere
but
which
were
no
longer
understood
in
france
or
in
the
lands
held
of
the
french
crown
the
popular
election
of
kings
comes
foremost
hugh
capet
was
an
elective
king
as
much
as
harold
but
the
french
kings
had
made
their
crown
the
most
strictly
hereditary
of
all
crowns
they
avoided
any
interregnum
by
having
their
sons
crowned
in
their
lifetime
so
with
the
great
fiefs
of
the
crown
the
notion
of
kingship
as
an
office
conferred
by
the
nation
of
a
duchy
or
county
as
an
office
held
under
the
king
was
still
fully
alive
in
england
in
gaul
it
was
forgotten
kingdom
duchies
counties
had
all
become
possessions
instead
of
offices
possessions
passing
by
hereditary
succession
of
some
kind
but
no
rule
of
hereditary
succession
was
universally
or
generally
accepted
to
this
day
the
kingdoms
of
europe
differ
as
to
the
question
of
female
succession
and
it
is
but
slowly
that
the
doctrine
of
representation
has
ousted
the
more
obvious
doctrine
of
nearness
of
kin
all
these
points
were
then
utterly
unsettled
crowns
save
of
course
that
of
the
empire
were
to
pass
by
hereditary
right
only
what
was
hereditary
right
at
such
a
time
claims
would
be
pressed
which
would
have
seemed
absurd
either
earlier
or
later
to
englishmen
if
it
seemed
strange
to
elect
one
who
was
not
of
the
stock
of
cerdic
it
seemed
much
more
strange
to
be
called
on
to
accept
without
election
or
to
elect
as
a
matter
of
course
one
who
was
not
of
the
stock
of
cerdic
and
who
was
a
stranger
into
the
bargain
out
of
england
it
would
not
seem
strange
when
william
set
forth
that
edward
having
no
direct
heirs
had
chosen
his
near
kinsman
william
as
his
successor
put
by
itself
that
statement
had
a
plausible
sound
the
transmission
of
a
crown
by
bequest
belongs
to
the
same
range
of
ideas
as
its
transmission
by
hereditary
right
both
assume
the
crown
to
be
a
property
and
not
an
office
nomination
of
harold
the
election
of
harold
the
fact
that
kindred
to
edward
lay
outside
the
royal
line
of
england
the
fact
that
there
was
in
the
person
of
edgar
a
nearer
kinsman
within
that
royal
line
could
all
be
slurred
over
or
explained
away
or
even
turned
to
profit
let
it
be
that
edward
on
his
had
recommended
harold
and
that
the
witan
had
elected
harold
the
recommendation
was
wrung
from
a
dying
man
in
opposition
to
an
earlier
act
done
when
he
was
able
to
act
freely
the
election
was
brought
about
by
force
or
fraud
if
it
was
free
it
was
of
no
force
against
earlier
claim
of
kindred
and
bequest
as
for
edgar
as
few
people
in
england
thought
of
him
still
fewer
out
of
england
would
have
ever
heard
of
him
it
is
more
strange
that
the
bastardy
of
william
did
not
tell
against
him
as
it
had
once
told
in
his
own
duchy
but
this
fact
again
marks
the
transitional
age
altogether
the
tale
that
a
man
who
was
no
kinsman
of
the
late
king
had
taken
to
himself
the
crown
which
the
king
had
bequeathed
to
a
kinsman
might
even
without
further
aggravation
be
easily
made
to
sound
like
a
tale
of
wrong
but
the
case
gained
tenfold
strength
when
william
added
that
the
doer
of
the
wrong
was
of
all
men
the
one
most
specially
bound
not
to
do
it
the
usurper
was
in
any
case
man
bound
to
act
in
all
things
for
his
lord
perhaps
he
was
more
perhaps
he
had
directly
sworn
to
receive
william
as
king
perhaps
he
had
promised
all
this
with
an
oath
of
special
solemnity
it
would
be
easy
to
enlarge
on
all
these
further
counts
as
making
up
an
amount
of
guilt
which
william
not
only
had
the
right
to
chastise
but
which
he
would
be
lacking
in
duty
if
he
failed
to
chastise
he
had
to
punish
the
perjurer
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
the
saints
surely
all
who
should
help
him
in
so
doing
would
be
helping
in
a
righteous
work
the
answer
to
all
this
was
obvious
putting
the
case
at
the
very
worst
assuming
that
harold
had
sworn
all
that
he
is
ever
said
to
have
sworn
assuming
that
he
swore
it
in
the
most
solemn
way
in
which
he
is
ever
said
to
have
sworn
it
claim
was
not
thereby
made
one
whit
better
whatever
own
guilt
might
be
the
people
of
england
had
no
share
in
it
nothing
that
harold
had
done
could
bar
their
right
to
choose
their
king
freely
even
if
harold
declined
the
crown
that
would
not
bind
the
electors
to
choose
william
but
when
the
notion
of
choosing
kings
had
begun
to
sound
strange
all
this
would
go
for
nothing
there
would
be
no
need
even
to
urge
that
in
any
case
the
wrong
done
by
harold
to
william
gave
william
a
against
harold
and
that
william
if
victorious
might
claim
the
crown
of
england
as
a
possession
of
by
right
of
conquest
in
fact
william
never
claimed
the
crown
by
conquest
as
conquest
is
commonly
understood
he
always
represented
himself
as
the
lawful
heir
unhappily
driven
to
use
force
to
obtain
his
rights
the
other
pleas
were
quite
enough
to
satisfy
most
men
out
of
england
and
scandinavia
work
was
to
claim
the
crown
of
which
he
was
unjustly
deprived
and
withal
to
deal
out
a
righteous
chastisement
on
the
unrighteous
and
ungodly
man
by
whom
he
had
been
deprived
of
it
in
the
hands
of
diplomatists
like
william
and
lanfranc
all
these
arguments
none
of
which
had
in
itself
the
slightest
strength
were
enough
to
turn
the
great
mass
of
continental
opinion
in
favour
but
he
could
add
further
arguments
specially
adapted
to
different
classes
of
minds
he
could
hold
out
the
prospect
of
plunder
the
prospect
of
lands
and
honours
in
a
land
whose
wealth
was
already
proverbial
it
might
of
course
be
answered
that
the
enterprise
against
england
was
hazardous
and
its
success
unlikely
but
in
such
matters
men
listen
rather
to
their
hopes
than
to
their
fears
to
the
normans
it
would
be
easy
not
only
to
make
out
a
case
against
harold
but
to
rake
up
old
grudges
against
the
english
nation
under
harold
the
son
of
cnut
alfred
a
prince
half
norman
by
birth
wholly
norman
by
education
the
brother
of
the
late
king
the
lawful
heir
to
the
crown
had
been
betrayed
and
murdered
by
somebody
a
widespread
belief
laid
the
deed
to
the
charge
of
the
father
of
the
new
king
this
story
might
easily
be
made
a
ground
of
national
complaint
by
normandy
against
england
and
it
was
easy
to
infer
that
harold
had
some
share
in
the
alleged
crime
of
godwine
it
was
easy
to
dwell
on
later
events
on
the
driving
of
so
many
normans
out
of
england
with
archbishop
robert
at
their
head
nay
not
only
had
the
lawful
primate
been
driven
out
but
an
usurper
had
been
set
in
his
place
and
this
usurping
archbishop
had
been
made
to
bestow
a
mockery
of
consecration
on
the
usurping
king
the
proposed
aggression
on
england
was
even
represented
as
a
missionary
work
undertaken
for
the
good
of
the
souls
of
the
benighted
islanders
for
though
the
english
were
undoubtedly
devout
after
their
own
fashion
there
was
much
in
the
ecclesiastical
state
of
england
which
displeased
strict
churchmen
beyond
sea
much
that
william
when
he
had
the
power
deemed
it
his
duty
to
reform
the
insular
position
of
england
naturally
parted
it
in
many
things
from
the
usages
and
feelings
of
the
mainland
and
it
was
not
hard
to
get
up
a
feeling
against
the
nation
as
well
as
against
its
king
all
this
could
not
really
strengthen
claim
but
it
made
men
look
more
favourably
on
his
enterprise
the
fact
that
the
witan
were
actually
in
session
at
death
had
made
it
possible
to
carry
out
election
and
coronation
with
extreme
speed
the
electors
had
made
their
choice
before
william
had
any
opportunity
of
formally
laying
his
claim
before
them
this
was
really
an
advantage
to
him
he
could
the
better
represent
the
election
and
coronation
as
invalid
his
first
step
was
of
course
to
send
an
embassy
to
harold
to
call
on
him
even
now
to
fulfil
his
oath
the
accounts
of
this
embassy
of
which
we
have
no
english
account
differ
as
much
as
the
different
accounts
of
the
oath
each
version
of
course
makes
william
demand
and
harold
refuse
whatever
it
had
made
harold
swear
these
demands
and
refusals
range
from
the
resignation
of
the
kingdom
to
a
marriage
with
daughter
and
it
is
hard
to
separate
this
embassy
from
later
messages
between
the
rivals
in
all
william
demands
harold
refuses
the
arguments
on
each
side
are
likely
to
be
genuine
harold
is
called
on
to
give
up
the
crown
to
william
to
hold
it
of
william
to
hold
part
of
the
kingdom
of
william
to
submit
the
question
to
the
judgement
of
the
pope
lastly
if
he
will
do
nothing
else
at
least
to
marry
daughter
different
writers
place
these
demands
at
different
times
immediately
after
election
or
immediately
before
the
battle
the
last
challenge
to
a
single
combat
between
harold
and
william
of
course
appears
only
on
the
eve
of
the
battle
now
none
of
these
accounts
come
from
contemporary
partisans
of
harold
every
one
is
touched
by
hostile
feeling
towards
him
thus
the
constitutional
language
that
is
put
into
his
mouth
almost
startling
from
its
modern
sound
has
greater
value
a
king
of
the
english
can
do
nothing
without
the
consent
of
his
witan
they
gave
him
the
kingdom
without
their
consent
he
can
not
resign
it
or
dismember
it
or
agree
to
hold
it
of
any
man
without
their
consent
he
can
not
even
marry
a
foreign
wife
or
he
answers
that
the
daughter
of
william
whom
he
promised
to
marry
is
dead
and
that
the
sister
whom
he
promised
to
give
to
a
norman
is
dead
also
harold
does
not
deny
the
fact
of
his
its
nature
he
justifies
its
breach
because
it
was
taken
against
is
will
and
because
it
was
in
itself
of
no
strength
as
binding
him
to
do
impossible
things
he
does
not
deny
earlier
promise
to
william
but
as
a
testament
is
of
no
force
while
the
testator
liveth
he
argues
that
it
is
cancelled
by
later
nomination
of
himself
in
truth
there
is
hardly
any
difference
between
the
disputants
as
to
matters
of
fact
one
side
admits
at
least
a
plighting
of
homage
on
the
part
of
harold
the
other
side
admits
nomination
and
election
the
real
difference
is
as
to
the
legal
effect
of
either
herein
comes
policy
the
question
was
one
of
english
law
and
of
nothing
else
a
matter
for
the
witan
of
england
and
for
no
other
judges
william
by
ingeniously
mixing
all
kinds
of
irrelevant
issues
contrived
to
remove
the
dispute
from
the
region
of
municipal
into
that
of
international
law
a
law
whose
chief
representative
was
the
bishop
of
rome
by
winning
the
pope
to
his
side
william
could
give
his
aggression
the
air
of
a
religious
war
but
in
so
doing
he
unwittingly
undermined
the
throne
that
he
was
seeking
and
the
thrones
of
all
other
princes
the
answers
which
harold
either
made
or
which
writers
of
his
time
thought
that
he
ought
to
have
made
are
of
the
greatest
moment
in
our
constitutional
history
the
king
is
the
doer
of
everything
but
he
can
do
nothing
of
moment
without
the
consent
of
his
witan
they
can
say
yea
or
nay
to
every
proposal
of
the
king
an
energetic
and
popular
king
would
get
no
answer
but
yea
to
whatever
he
chose
to
ask
a
king
who
often
got
the
answer
of
nay
nay
was
in
great
danger
of
losing
his
kingdom
the
statesmanship
of
william
knew
how
to
turn
this
constitutional
system
without
making
any
change
in
the
letter
into
a
despotism
like
that
of
constantinople
or
cordova
but
the
letter
lived
to
come
to
light
again
on
occasion
the
revolution
of
was
a
falling
back
on
the
doctrines
of
and
the
revolution
of
was
a
falling
back
on
the
doctrines
of
the
principle
at
all
three
periods
is
that
the
power
of
the
king
is
strictly
limited
by
law
but
that
within
the
limits
which
the
law
sets
to
his
power
he
acts
according
to
his
own
discretion
king
and
witan
stand
out
as
distinct
powers
each
of
which
needs
the
assent
of
the
other
to
its
acts
and
which
may
always
refuse
that
assent
the
political
work
of
the
last
two
hundred
years
has
been
to
hinder
these
direct
collisions
between
king
and
parliament
by
the
ingenious
conventional
device
of
a
body
of
men
who
shall
be
in
name
the
ministers
of
the
crown
but
in
truth
the
ministers
of
one
house
of
parliament
we
do
not
understand
our
own
political
history
still
less
can
we
understand
the
position
and
the
statesmanship
of
the
conqueror
unless
we
fully
take
in
what
the
english
constitution
in
the
eleventh
century
really
was
how
very
are
some
of
its
doctrines
some
of
its
forms
statesmen
of
our
own
day
might
do
well
to
study
the
meagre
records
of
the
gemót
of
there
is
the
earliest
recorded
instance
of
a
debate
on
a
question
of
foreign
policy
earl
godwine
proposes
to
give
help
to
denmark
then
at
war
with
norway
he
is
outvoted
on
the
motion
of
earl
leofric
the
man
of
moderate
politics
who
appears
as
leader
of
the
party
of
it
may
be
that
in
some
things
we
have
not
always
advanced
in
the
space
of
eight
hundred
years
the
negotiations
of
william
with
his
own
subjects
with
foreign
powers
and
with
the
pope
are
hard
to
arrange
in
order
several
negotiations
were
doubtless
going
on
at
the
same
time
the
embassy
to
harold
would
of
course
come
first
of
all
till
his
demand
had
been
made
and
refused
william
could
make
no
appeal
elsewhere
we
know
not
whether
the
embassy
was
sent
before
or
after
journey
to
northumberland
before
or
after
his
marriage
with
ealdgyth
if
harold
was
already
married
the
demand
that
he
should
marry
daughter
could
have
been
meant
only
in
mockery
indeed
the
whole
embassy
was
so
far
meant
in
mockery
that
it
was
sent
without
any
expectation
that
its
demands
would
be
listened
to
it
was
sent
to
put
harold
from
point
of
view
more
thoroughly
in
the
wrong
and
to
strengthen
case
against
him
it
would
therefore
be
sent
at
the
first
moment
the
only
statement
from
a
very
poor
authority
certainly
makes
the
embassy
come
on
the
tenth
day
after
death
next
after
the
embassy
would
come
appeal
to
his
own
subjects
though
lanfranc
might
well
be
pleading
at
rome
while
william
was
pleading
at
lillebonne
the
duke
first
consulted
a
select
company
who
promised
their
own
services
but
declined
to
pledge
any
one
else
it
was
held
that
no
norman
was
bound
to
follow
the
duke
in
an
attempt
to
win
for
himself
a
crown
beyond
the
sea
but
voluntary
help
was
soon
ready
a
meeting
of
the
whole
baronage
of
normandy
was
held
at
lillebonne
the
assembly
declined
any
obligation
which
could
be
turned
into
a
precedent
and
passed
no
general
vote
at
all
but
the
barons
were
won
over
one
by
one
and
each
promised
help
in
men
and
ships
according
to
his
means
william
had
thus
with
some
difficulty
gained
the
support
of
his
own
subjects
but
when
he
had
once
gained
it
it
was
a
zealous
support
and
as
the
flame
spread
from
one
part
of
europe
to
another
the
zeal
of
normandy
would
wax
keener
and
keener
the
dealings
of
william
with
foreign
powers
are
told
us
in
a
confused
piecemeal
and
sometimes
contradictory
way
we
hear
that
embassies
went
to
the
young
king
henry
of
germany
son
of
the
great
emperor
the
friend
of
england
and
also
to
swegen
of
denmark
the
norman
story
runs
that
both
princes
promised
william
their
active
support
yet
swegen
the
near
kinsman
of
harold
was
a
friend
of
england
and
the
same
writer
who
puts
this
promise
into
his
mouth
makes
him
send
troops
to
help
his
english
cousin
young
henry
or
his
advisers
could
have
no
motive
for
helping
william
but
subjects
of
the
empire
were
at
least
not
hindered
from
joining
his
banner
to
the
french
king
william
perhaps
offered
the
bait
of
holding
the
crown
of
england
of
him
but
philip
is
said
to
have
discouraged
enterprise
as
much
as
he
could
still
he
did
not
hinder
french
subjects
from
taking
a
part
in
it
of
the
princes
who
held
of
the
french
crown
eustace
of
boulogne
who
joined
the
muster
in
person
and
guy
of
ponthieu
own
vassal
who
sent
his
son
seem
to
have
been
the
only
ones
who
did
more
than
allow
the
levying
of
volunteers
in
their
dominions
a
strange
tale
is
told
that
conan
of
britanny
took
this
moment
for
bringing
up
his
own
forgotten
pretensions
to
the
norman
duchy
if
william
was
going
to
win
england
let
him
give
up
normandy
to
him
he
presently
the
tale
goes
died
of
a
strange
form
of
poisoning
in
which
it
is
implied
that
william
had
a
hand
this
is
the
story
of
walter
and
biota
over
again
it
is
perhaps
enough
to
say
that
the
breton
writers
know
nothing
of
the
tale
but
the
great
negotiation
of
all
was
with
the
papal
court
we
might
have
thought
that
the
envoy
would
be
lanfranc
so
well
skilled
in
roman
ways
but
william
perhaps
needed
him
as
a
constant
adviser
by
his
own
person
gilbert
archdeacon
of
lisieux
was
sent
to
pope
alexander
no
application
could
better
suit
papal
interests
than
the
one
that
was
now
made
but
there
were
some
moral
difficulties
not
a
few
of
the
cardinals
hildebrand
tells
us
himself
argued
not
without
strong
language
towards
hildebrand
that
the
church
had
nothing
to
do
with
such
matters
and
that
it
was
sinful
to
encourage
a
claim
which
could
not
be
enforced
without
bloodshed
but
with
many
with
hildebrand
among
them
the
notion
of
the
church
as
a
party
or
a
power
came
before
all
thoughts
of
its
higher
duties
one
side
was
carefully
heard
the
other
seems
not
to
have
been
heard
at
all
we
hear
of
no
summons
to
harold
and
the
king
of
the
english
could
not
have
pleaded
at
the
bar
without
acknowledging
that
his
case
was
at
least
doubtful
the
judgement
of
alexander
or
of
hildebrand
was
given
for
william
harold
was
declared
to
be
an
usurper
perhaps
declared
excommunicated
the
right
to
the
english
crown
was
declared
to
be
in
the
duke
of
the
normans
and
william
was
solemnly
blessed
in
the
enterprise
in
which
he
was
at
once
to
win
his
own
rights
to
chastise
the
to
reform
the
spiritual
state
of
the
misguided
islanders
to
teach
them
fuller
obedience
to
the
roman
see
and
more
regular
payment
of
its
temporal
dues
william
gained
his
immediate
point
but
his
successors
on
the
english
throne
paid
the
penalty
hildebrand
gained
his
point
for
ever
or
for
as
long
a
time
as
men
might
be
willing
to
accept
the
bishop
of
rome
as
a
judge
in
any
matters
the
precedent
by
which
hildebrand
under
another
name
took
on
him
to
dispose
of
a
higher
crown
than
that
of
england
was
now
fully
established
as
an
outward
sign
of
papal
favour
william
received
a
consecrated
banner
and
a
ring
containing
a
hair
of
saint
peter
here
was
something
for
men
to
fight
for
the
war
was
now
a
holy
one
all
who
were
ready
to
promote
their
health
by
slaughter
and
plunder
might
flock
to
standard
to
the
standard
of
saint
peter
men
came
from
most
lands
the
normans
of
apulia
and
sicily
being
of
course
not
slow
to
take
up
the
quarrel
of
their
kinsfolk
but
next
to
his
own
normandy
the
lands
which
sent
most
help
were
flanders
the
land
of
matilda
and
britanny
where
the
name
of
the
saxon
might
still
be
hateful
we
must
never
forget
that
the
host
of
william
the
men
who
won
england
the
men
who
settled
in
england
were
not
an
exclusively
norman
body
not
norman
but
is
the
name
most
commonly
opposed
to
as
the
name
of
the
conquering
people
each
norman
severally
would
have
scorned
that
name
for
himself
personally
but
it
was
the
only
name
that
could
mark
the
whole
of
which
he
and
his
countrymen
formed
a
part
yet
if
the
normans
were
but
a
part
they
were
the
greatest
and
the
noblest
part
their
presence
alone
redeemed
the
enterprise
from
being
a
simple
enterprise
of
brigandage
the
norman
conquest
was
after
all
a
norman
conquest
men
of
other
lands
were
merely
helpers
so
far
as
it
was
not
norman
it
was
italian
the
subtle
wit
of
lombard
lanfranc
and
tuscan
hildebrand
did
as
much
to
overthrow
us
as
the
lance
and
bow
of
normandy
chapter
vii
invasion
of
england
the
statesmanship
of
william
had
triumphed
the
people
of
england
had
chosen
their
king
and
a
large
part
of
the
world
had
been
won
over
by
the
arts
of
a
foreign
prince
to
believe
that
it
was
a
righteous
and
holy
work
to
set
him
on
the
throne
to
which
the
english
people
had
chosen
the
foremost
man
among
themselves
no
diplomatic
success
was
ever
more
thorough
unluckily
we
know
nothing
of
the
state
of
feeling
in
england
while
william
was
plotting
and
pleading
beyond
the
sea
nor
do
we
know
how
much
men
in
england
knew
of
what
was
going
on
in
other
lands
or
what
they
thought
when
they
heard
of
it
we
know
only
that
after
harold
had
won
over
northumberland
he
came
back
and
held
the
easter
gemót
at
westminster
then
in
the
words
of
the
chronicler
was
known
to
him
that
william
bastard
king
kinsman
would
come
hither
and
win
this
this
is
all
that
our
own
writers
tell
us
about
william
bastard
between
his
peaceful
visit
to
england
in
and
his
warlike
visit
in
but
we
know
that
king
harold
did
all
that
man
could
do
to
defeat
his
purposes
and
that
he
was
therein
loyally
supported
by
the
great
mass
of
the
english
nation
we
may
safely
say
by
all
save
his
two
and
so
many
as
they
could
influence
doings
we
know
more
fully
the
military
events
of
this
wonderful
year
there
is
no
need
to
tell
in
detail
but
we
see
that
generalship
was
equal
to
his
statesmanship
and
that
it
was
met
by
equal
generalship
on
the
side
of
harold
moreover
the
luck
of
william
is
as
clear
as
either
his
statesmanship
or
his
generalship
when
harold
was
crowned
on
the
day
of
the
epiphany
he
must
have
felt
sure
that
he
would
have
to
withstand
an
invasion
of
england
before
the
year
was
out
but
it
could
not
have
come
into
the
mind
of
harold
william
or
lanfranc
or
any
other
man
that
he
would
have
to
withstand
two
invasions
of
england
at
the
same
moment
it
was
the
invasion
of
harold
of
norway
at
the
same
time
as
the
invasion
of
william
which
decided
the
fate
of
england
the
issue
of
the
struggle
might
have
gone
against
england
had
she
had
to
strive
against
one
enemy
only
as
it
was
it
was
the
attack
made
by
two
enemies
at
once
which
divided
her
strength
and
enabled
the
normans
to
land
without
resistance
the
two
invasions
came
as
nearly
as
possible
at
the
same
moment
harold
hardrada
can
hardly
have
reached
the
yorkshire
coast
before
september
the
battle
of
fulford
was
fought
on
september
and
that
of
stamfordbridge
on
september
william
landed
on
september
and
the
battle
of
senlac
was
fought
on
october
moreover
fleet
was
ready
by
august
his
delay
in
crossing
was
owing
to
his
waiting
for
a
favourable
wind
when
william
landed
the
event
of
the
struggle
in
the
north
could
not
have
been
known
in
sussex
he
might
have
had
to
strive
not
with
harold
of
england
but
with
harold
of
norway
as
his
conqueror
at
what
time
of
the
year
harold
hardrada
first
planned
his
invasion
of
england
is
quite
uncertain
we
can
say
nothing
of
his
doings
till
he
is
actually
afloat
and
with
the
three
mighty
forms
of
william
and
the
two
harolds
on
the
scene
there
is
something
at
once
grotesque
and
perplexing
in
the
way
in
which
an
english
traitor
flits
about
among
them
the
banished
tostig
deprived
of
his
earldom
in
the
autumn
of
had
then
taken
refuge
in
flanders
he
now
plays
a
busy
part
the
details
of
which
are
lost
in
contradictory
accounts
but
it
is
certain
that
in
may
he
made
an
ineffectual
attack
on
england
and
this
attack
was
most
likely
made
with
the
connivance
of
william
it
suited
william
to
use
tostig
as
an
instrument
and
to
encourage
so
restless
a
spirit
in
annoying
the
common
enemy
it
is
also
certain
that
tostig
was
with
the
norwegian
fleet
in
september
and
that
he
died
at
stamfordbridge
we
know
also
that
he
was
in
scotland
between
may
and
september
it
is
therefore
hard
to
believe
that
tostig
had
so
great
a
hand
in
stirring
up
harold
hardrada
to
his
expedition
as
the
norwegian
story
makes
out
most
likely
tostig
simply
joined
the
expedition
which
harold
hardrada
independently
planned
one
thing
is
certain
that
when
harold
of
england
was
attacked
by
two
enemies
at
once
it
was
not
by
two
enemies
acting
in
concert
the
interests
of
william
and
of
harold
of
norway
were
as
much
opposed
to
one
another
as
either
of
them
was
to
the
interests
of
harold
of
england
one
great
difficulty
beset
harold
and
william
alike
either
in
normandy
or
in
england
it
was
easy
to
get
together
an
army
ready
to
fight
a
battle
it
was
not
easy
to
keep
a
large
body
of
men
under
arms
for
any
long
time
without
fighting
it
was
still
harder
to
keep
them
at
once
without
fighting
and
without
plundering
what
william
had
done
in
this
way
in
two
invasions
of
normandy
he
was
now
called
on
to
do
on
a
greater
scale
his
great
and
motley
army
was
kept
during
a
great
part
of
august
and
september
first
at
the
dive
then
at
saint
valery
waiting
for
the
wind
that
was
to
take
it
to
england
and
it
was
kept
without
doing
any
serious
damage
to
the
lands
where
they
were
encamped
in
a
holy
war
this
time
was
of
course
largely
spent
in
appeals
to
the
religious
feelings
of
the
army
then
came
the
wonderful
luck
of
william
which
enabled
him
to
cross
at
the
particular
moment
when
he
did
cross
a
little
earlier
or
later
he
would
have
found
his
landing
stoutly
disputed
as
it
was
he
landed
without
resistance
harold
of
england
not
being
able
in
his
own
words
to
be
everywhere
at
once
had
done
what
he
could
he
and
his
brothers
gyrth
and
leofwine
undertook
the
defence
of
southern
england
against
the
norman
the
earls
of
the
north
his
edwin
and
morkere
were
to
defend
their
own
land
against
the
norwegians
his
own
preparations
were
looked
on
with
wonder
to
guard
the
long
line
of
coast
against
the
invader
he
got
together
such
a
force
both
by
sea
and
land
as
no
king
had
ever
got
together
before
and
he
kept
it
together
for
a
longer
time
than
william
did
through
four
months
of
inaction
save
perhaps
some
small
encounters
by
sea
at
last
early
in
september
provisions
failed
men
were
no
doubt
clamouring
to
go
back
for
the
harvest
and
the
great
host
had
to
be
disbanded
could
william
have
sailed
as
soon
as
his
fleet
was
ready
he
would
have
found
southern
england
thoroughly
prepared
to
meet
him
meanwhile
the
northern
earls
had
clearly
not
kept
so
good
watch
as
the
king
harold
hardrada
harried
the
yorkshire
coast
he
sailed
up
the
ouse
and
landed
without
resistance
at
last
the
earls
met
him
in
arms
and
were
defeated
by
the
northmen
at
fulford
near
york
four
days
later
york
capitulated
and
agreed
to
receive
harold
hardrada
as
king
meanwhile
the
news
reached
harold
of
england
he
got
together
his
housecarls
and
such
other
troops
as
could
be
mustered
at
the
moment
and
by
a
march
of
almost
incredible
speed
he
was
able
to
save
the
city
and
all
northern
england
the
fight
of
stamfordbridge
the
defeat
and
death
of
the
most
famous
warrior
of
the
north
was
the
last
and
greatest
success
of
harold
of
england
but
his
northward
march
had
left
southern
england
utterly
unprotected
had
the
south
wind
delayed
a
little
longer
he
might
before
the
second
enemy
came
have
been
again
on
the
coast
as
it
was
three
days
after
stamfordbridge
while
harold
of
england
was
still
at
york
william
of
normandy
landed
without
opposition
at
pevensey
thus
wonderfully
had
an
easy
path
into
england
been
opened
for
william
the
norwegian
invasion
had
come
at
the
best
moment
for
his
purposes
and
the
result
had
been
what
he
must
have
wished
with
one
harold
he
must
fight
and
to
fight
with
harold
of
england
was
clearly
best
for
his
ends
his
work
would
not
have
been
done
if
another
had
stepped
in
to
chastise
the
perjurer
now
that
he
was
in
england
it
became
a
trial
of
generalship
between
him
and
harold
policy
was
to
provoke
harold
to
fight
at
once
it
was
perhaps
at
least
thought
follow
yet
more
thoroughly
own
example
in
the
french
invasions
let
him
watch
and
follow
the
enemy
let
him
avoid
all
action
and
even
lay
waste
the
land
between
london
and
the
south
coast
and
the
strength
of
the
invaders
would
gradually
be
worn
out
but
it
might
have
been
hard
to
enforce
such
a
policy
on
men
whose
hearts
were
stirred
by
the
invasion
and
one
part
of
whom
the
own
thegns
and
housecarls
were
eager
to
follow
up
their
victory
over
the
northern
with
a
yet
mightier
victory
over
the
norman
and
harold
spoke
as
an
english
king
should
speak
when
he
answered
that
he
would
never
lay
waste
a
single
rood
of
english
ground
that
he
would
never
harm
the
lands
or
the
goods
of
the
men
who
had
chosen
him
to
be
their
king
in
the
trial
of
skill
between
the
two
commanders
each
to
some
extent
carried
his
point
havoc
of
a
large
part
of
sussex
compelled
harold
to
march
at
once
to
give
battle
but
harold
was
able
to
give
battle
at
a
place
of
his
own
choosing
thoroughly
suited
for
the
kind
of
warfare
which
he
had
to
wage
harold
was
blamed
as
defeated
generals
are
blamed
for
being
too
eager
to
fight
and
not
waiting
for
more
troops
but
to
any
one
who
studies
the
ground
it
is
plain
that
harold
needed
not
more
troops
but
to
some
extent
better
troops
and
that
he
would
not
have
got
those
better
troops
by
waiting
from
york
harold
had
marched
to
london
as
the
for
southern
and
eastern
england
as
well
as
for
the
few
who
actually
followed
him
from
the
north
and
those
who
joined
him
on
the
march
edwin
and
morkere
were
bidden
to
follow
with
the
full
force
of
their
earldoms
this
they
took
care
not
to
do
harold
and
his
had
saved
them
but
they
would
not
strike
a
blow
back
again
both
now
and
earlier
in
the
year
they
doubtless
aimed
at
a
division
of
the
kingdom
such
as
had
been
twice
made
within
fifty
years
either
harold
or
william
might
reign
in
wessex
and
edwin
should
reign
in
northumberland
and
mercia
william
the
enemy
of
harold
but
no
enemy
of
theirs
might
be
satisfied
with
the
part
of
england
which
was
under
the
immediate
rule
of
harold
and
his
brothers
and
might
allow
the
house
of
leofric
to
keep
at
least
an
in
the
north
that
the
brother
earls
held
back
from
the
muster
is
undoubted
and
this
explanation
fits
in
with
their
whole
conduct
both
before
and
after
harold
had
thus
at
his
command
the
picked
men
of
part
of
england
only
and
he
had
to
supply
the
place
of
those
who
were
lacking
with
such
forces
as
he
could
get
the
lack
of
discipline
on
the
part
of
these
inferior
troops
lost
harold
the
battle
but
matters
would
hardly
have
been
mended
by
waiting
for
men
who
had
made
up
their
minds
not
to
come
the
messages
exchanged
between
king
and
duke
immediately
before
the
battle
as
well
as
at
an
earlier
time
have
been
spoken
of
already
the
challenge
to
single
combat
at
least
comes
now
when
harold
refused
every
demand
william
called
on
harold
to
spare
the
blood
of
his
followers
and
decide
his
claims
by
battle
in
his
own
person
such
a
challenge
was
in
the
spirit
of
norman
jurisprudence
which
in
doubtful
cases
looked
for
the
judgement
of
god
not
as
the
english
did
by
the
ordeal
but
by
the
personal
combat
of
the
two
parties
yet
this
challenge
too
was
surely
given
in
the
hope
that
harold
would
refuse
it
and
would
thereby
put
himself
in
norman
eyes
yet
more
thoroughly
in
the
wrong
for
the
challenge
was
one
which
harold
could
not
but
refuse
william
looked
on
himself
as
one
who
claimed
his
own
from
one
who
wrongfully
kept
him
out
of
it
he
was
plaintiff
in
a
suit
in
which
harold
was
defendant
that
plaintiff
and
defendant
were
both
accompanied
by
armies
was
an
accident
for
which
the
defendant
who
had
refused
all
peaceful
means
of
settlement
was
to
blame
but
harold
and
his
people
could
not
look
on
the
matter
as
a
mere
question
between
two
men
the
crown
was
by
the
gift
of
the
nation
and
he
could
not
sever
his
own
cause
from
the
cause
of
the
nation
the
crown
was
his
but
it
was
not
his
to
stake
on
the
issue
of
a
single
combat
if
harold
were
killed
the
nation
might
give
the
crown
to
whom
they
thought
good
death
could
not
make
claim
one
jot
better
the
cause
was
not
personal
but
national
the
norman
duke
had
by
a
wanton
invasion
wronged
not
the
king
only
but
every
man
in
england
and
every
man
might
claim
to
help
in
driving
him
out
again
in
an
ordinary
wager
of
battle
the
judgement
can
be
enforced
here
whether
william
slew
harold
or
harold
slew
william
there
was
no
means
of
enforcing
the
judgement
except
by
the
strength
of
the
two
armies
if
harold
fell
the
english
army
were
not
likely
to
receive
william
as
king
if
william
fell
the
norman
army
was
still
less
likely
to
go
quietly
out
of
england
the
challenge
was
meant
as
a
mere
blind
it
would
raise
the
spirit
of
followers
it
would
be
something
for
his
poets
and
chroniclers
to
record
in
his
honour
that
was
all
the
actual
battle
fought
on
senlac
on
saint
day
was
more
than
a
trial
of
skill
and
courage
between
two
captains
and
two
armies
it
was
like
the
old
battles
of
macedonian
and
roman
a
trial
between
two
modes
of
warfare
the
english
clave
to
the
old
teutonic
tactics
they
fought
on
foot
in
the
close
array
of
the
those
who
rode
to
the
field
dismounted
when
the
fight
began
they
first
hurled
their
javelins
and
then
took
to
the
weapons
of
close
combat
among
these
the
danish
axe
brought
in
by
cnut
had
nearly
displaced
the
older
english
broadsword
such
was
the
array
of
the
housecarls
and
of
the
thegns
who
had
followed
harold
from
york
or
joined
him
on
his
march
but
the
treason
of
edwin
and
morkere
had
made
it
needful
to
supply
the
place
of
the
picked
men
of
northumberland
with
irregular
levies
armed
almost
anyhow
of
their
weapons
of
various
kinds
the
bow
was
the
rarest
the
strength
of
the
normans
lay
in
the
arms
in
which
the
english
were
lacking
in
horsemen
and
archers
these
last
seem
to
have
been
a
force
of
training
we
first
hear
of
the
norman
bowmen
at
varaville
these
two
ways
of
fighting
were
brought
each
one
to
perfection
by
the
leaders
on
each
side
they
had
not
yet
been
tried
against
one
another
at
stamfordbridge
harold
had
defeated
an
enemy
whose
tactics
were
the
same
as
his
own
william
had
not
fought
a
pitched
battle
since
in
his
youth
indeed
pitched
battles
such
as
english
and
scandinavian
warriors
were
used
to
in
the
wars
of
edmund
and
cnut
were
rare
in
continental
warfare
that
warfare
mainly
consisted
in
the
attack
and
defence
of
strong
places
and
in
skirmishes
fought
under
their
walls
but
william
knew
how
to
make
use
of
troops
of
different
kinds
and
to
adapt
them
to
any
emergency
harold
too
was
a
man
of
resources
he
had
gained
his
welsh
successes
by
adapting
his
men
to
the
way
of
fighting
to
withstand
the
charge
of
the
norman
horsemen
harold
clave
to
the
national
tactics
but
he
chose
for
the
place
of
battle
a
spot
where
those
tactics
would
have
the
advantage
a
battle
on
the
low
ground
would
have
been
favourable
to
cavalry
harold
therefore
occupied
and
fenced
in
a
hill
the
hill
of
senlac
the
site
in
after
days
of
the
abbey
and
town
of
battle
and
there
awaited
the
norman
attack
the
norman
horsemen
had
thus
to
make
their
way
up
the
hill
under
the
shower
of
the
english
javelins
and
to
meet
the
axes
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
barricade
and
these
tactics
were
thoroughly
successful
till
the
inferior
troops
were
tempted
to
come
down
from
the
hill
and
chase
the
bretons
whom
they
had
driven
back
this
suggested
to
william
the
device
of
the
feigned
flight
the
english
line
of
defence
was
broken
and
the
advantage
of
ground
was
lost
thus
was
the
great
battle
lost
and
the
war
too
was
lost
by
the
deaths
of
harold
and
his
brothers
which
left
england
without
leaders
and
by
the
unyielding
valour
of
immediate
following
they
were
slain
to
a
man
and
england
was
left
defenceless
william
now
truly
the
conqueror
in
the
vulgar
sense
was
still
far
from
having
full
possession
of
his
conquest
he
had
military
possession
of
part
of
one
shire
only
he
had
to
look
for
further
resistance
and
he
met
with
not
a
little
but
his
combined
luck
and
policy
served
him
well
he
could
put
on
the
form
of
full
possession
before
he
had
the
reality
he
could
treat
all
further
resistance
as
rebellion
against
an
established
authority
he
could
make
resistance
desultory
and
isolated
william
had
to
subdue
england
in
detail
he
had
never
again
to
fight
what
the
english
chroniclers
call
a
his
policy
after
his
victory
was
obvious
still
uncrowned
he
was
not
even
in
his
own
view
king
but
he
alone
had
the
right
to
become
king
he
had
thus
far
been
driven
to
maintain
his
rights
by
force
he
was
not
disposed
to
use
force
any
further
if
peaceful
possession
was
to
be
had
his
course
was
therefore
to
show
himself
stern
to
all
who
withstood
him
but
to
take
all
who
submitted
into
his
protection
and
favour
he
seems
however
to
have
looked
for
a
speedier
submission
than
really
happened
he
waited
a
while
in
his
camp
for
men
to
come
in
and
acknowledge
him
as
none
came
he
set
forth
to
win
by
the
strong
arm
the
land
which
he
claimed
of
right
thus
to
look
for
an
immediate
submission
was
not
unnatural
fully
believing
in
the
justice
of
his
own
cause
william
would
believe
in
it
all
the
more
after
the
issue
of
the
battle
god
harold
had
said
should
judge
between
himself
and
william
and
god
had
judged
in
favour
with
all
his
he
would
hardly
understand
how
differently
things
looked
in
english
eyes
some
indeed
specially
churchmen
specially
foreign
churchmen
now
began
to
doubt
whether
to
fight
against
william
was
not
to
fight
against
god
but
to
the
nation
at
large
william
was
simply
as
hubba
swegen
and
cnut
in
past
times
england
had
before
now
been
conquered
but
never
in
a
single
fight
alfred
and
edmund
had
fought
battle
after
battle
with
the
dane
and
men
had
no
mind
to
submit
to
the
norman
because
he
had
been
once
victorious
but
alfred
and
edmund
in
alternate
defeat
and
victory
lived
to
fight
again
their
people
had
not
to
choose
a
new
king
the
king
had
merely
to
gather
a
new
army
but
harold
was
slain
and
the
first
question
was
how
to
fill
his
place
the
witan
so
many
as
could
be
got
together
met
to
choose
a
king
whose
first
duty
would
be
to
meet
william
the
conqueror
in
arms
the
choice
was
not
easy
sons
were
young
and
not
born
æthelings
his
brothers
of
whom
gyrth
at
least
must
have
been
fit
to
reign
had
fallen
with
him
edwin
and
morkere
were
not
at
the
battle
but
they
were
at
the
election
but
schemes
for
winning
the
crown
for
the
house
of
leofric
would
find
no
favour
in
an
assembly
held
in
london
for
lack
of
any
better
candidate
the
hereditary
sentiment
prevailed
young
edgar
was
chosen
but
the
bishops
it
is
said
did
not
agree
they
must
have
held
that
god
had
declared
in
favour
of
william
edwin
and
morkere
did
agree
but
they
withdrew
to
their
earldoms
still
perhaps
cherishing
hopes
of
a
divided
kingdom
edgar
as
did
at
least
one
act
of
kingship
by
confirming
the
election
of
an
abbot
of
peterborough
but
of
any
general
preparation
for
warfare
there
is
not
a
sign
the
local
resistance
which
william
met
with
shows
that
with
any
combined
action
the
case
was
not
hopeless
but
with
edgar
for
king
with
the
northern
earls
withdrawing
their
forces
with
the
bishops
at
least
lukewarm
nothing
could
be
done
the
londoners
were
eager
to
fight
so
doubtless
were
others
but
there
was
no
leader
so
far
from
there
being
another
harold
or
edmund
to
risk
another
battle
there
was
not
even
a
leader
to
carry
out
the
policy
of
fabius
and
gyrth
meanwhile
the
conqueror
was
advancing
by
his
own
road
and
after
his
own
fashion
we
must
remember
the
effect
of
the
mere
slaughter
of
the
great
battle
own
army
had
suffered
severely
he
did
not
leave
hastings
till
he
had
received
reinforcements
from
normandy
but
to
england
the
battle
meant
the
loss
of
the
whole
force
of
the
shires
a
large
part
of
england
was
left
helpless
william
followed
much
the
same
course
as
he
had
followed
in
maine
a
legal
claimant
of
the
crown
it
was
his
interest
as
soon
as
possible
to
become
a
crowned
king
and
that
in
his
church
at
westminster
but
it
was
not
his
interest
to
march
straight
on
london
and
demand
the
crown
sword
in
hand
he
saw
that
without
the
support
of
the
northern
earls
edgar
could
not
possibly
stand
and
that
submission
to
himself
was
only
a
question
of
time
he
therefore
chose
a
roundabout
course
through
those
shires
which
were
wholly
without
means
of
resisting
him
he
marched
from
sussex
into
kent
harrying
the
land
as
he
went
to
frighten
the
people
into
submission
the
men
of
romney
had
before
the
battle
cut
in
pieces
a
party
of
normans
who
had
fallen
into
their
hands
most
likely
by
sea
william
took
some
undescribed
vengeance
for
their
slaughter
dover
and
its
castle
the
castle
which
in
some
accounts
harold
had
sworn
to
surrender
to
william
yielded
without
a
blow
here
then
he
was
gracious
when
some
of
his
unruly
followers
set
fire
to
the
houses
of
the
town
william
made
good
the
losses
of
their
owners
canterbury
submitted
from
thence
by
a
bold
stroke
he
sent
messengers
who
received
the
submission
of
winchester
he
marched
on
ravaging
as
he
went
to
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
london
but
keeping
ever
on
the
right
bank
of
the
thames
but
a
gallant
sally
of
the
citizens
was
repulsed
by
the
normans
and
the
suburb
of
southwark
was
burned
william
marched
along
the
river
to
wallingford
here
he
crossed
receiving
for
the
first
time
the
active
support
of
an
englishman
of
high
rank
wiggod
of
wallingford
sheriff
of
oxfordshire
he
became
one
of
a
small
class
of
englishmen
who
were
received
to
fullest
favour
and
kept
at
least
as
high
a
position
under
him
as
they
had
held
before
william
still
kept
on
marching
and
harrying
to
the
north
of
london
as
he
had
before
done
to
the
south
the
city
was
to
be
isolated
within
a
cordon
of
wasted
lands
his
policy
succeeded
as
no
succours
came
from
the
north
the
hearts
of
those
who
had
chosen
them
a
king
failed
at
the
approach
of
his
rival
at
berkhampstead
edgar
himself
with
several
bishops
and
chief
men
came
to
make
their
submission
they
offered
the
crown
to
william
and
after
some
debate
he
accepted
it
but
before
he
came
in
person
he
took
means
to
secure
the
city
the
beginnings
of
the
fortress
were
now
laid
which
in
the
course
of
reign
grew
into
the
mighty
tower
of
london
it
may
seem
strange
that
when
his
great
object
was
at
last
within
his
grasp
william
should
have
made
his
acceptance
of
it
a
matter
of
debate
he
claims
the
crown
as
his
right
the
crown
is
offered
to
him
and
yet
he
doubts
about
taking
it
ought
he
he
asks
to
take
the
crown
of
a
kingdom
of
which
he
has
not
as
yet
full
possession
at
that
time
the
territory
of
which
william
had
even
military
possession
could
not
have
stretched
much
to
the
of
a
line
drawn
from
winchester
to
norwich
outside
that
line
men
were
as
william
is
made
to
say
still
in
rebellion
his
scruples
were
come
over
by
an
orator
who
was
neither
norman
nor
english
but
one
of
his
foreign
followers
haimer
viscount
of
thouars
the
debate
was
most
likely
got
up
at
bidding
but
it
was
not
got
up
without
a
motive
william
ever
seeking
outward
legality
seeking
to
do
things
peaceably
when
they
could
be
done
peaceably
seeking
for
means
to
put
every
possible
enemy
in
the
wrong
wished
to
make
his
acceptance
of
the
english
crown
as
formally
regular
as
might
be
strong
as
he
held
his
claim
to
be
by
the
gift
of
edward
it
would
be
better
to
be
if
not
strictly
chosen
at
least
peacefully
accepted
by
the
chief
men
of
england
it
might
some
day
serve
his
purpose
to
say
that
the
crown
had
been
offered
to
him
and
that
he
had
accepted
it
only
after
a
debate
in
which
the
chief
speaker
was
an
impartial
stranger
having
gained
this
point
more
william
set
out
from
berkhampstead
already
in
outward
form
of
the
english
the
rite
which
was
to
change
him
from
into
full
king
took
place
in
church
of
westminster
on
christmas
day
somewhat
more
than
two
months
after
the
great
battle
somewhat
less
than
twelve
months
after
the
death
of
edward
and
the
coronation
of
harold
nothing
that
was
needed
for
a
lawful
crowning
was
lacking
the
consent
of
the
people
the
oath
of
the
king
the
anointing
by
the
hands
of
a
lawful
metropolitan
all
were
there
ealdred
acted
as
the
actual
celebrant
while
stigand
took
the
second
place
in
the
ceremony
but
this
outward
harmony
between
the
nation
and
its
new
king
was
marred
by
an
unhappy
accident
norman
horsemen
stationed
outside
the
church
mistook
the
shout
with
which
the
people
accepted
the
new
king
for
the
shout
of
men
who
were
doing
him
damage
but
instead
of
going
to
his
help
they
began
in
true
norman
fashion
to
set
fire
to
the
neighbouring
houses
the
havoc
and
plunder
that
followed
disturbed
the
solemnities
of
the
day
and
were
a
bad
omen
for
the
new
reign
it
was
no
personal
fault
of
in
putting
himself
in
the
hands
of
subjects
of
such
new
and
doubtful
loyalty
he
needed
men
near
at
hand
whom
he
could
trust
but
then
it
was
his
doing
that
england
had
to
receive
a
king
who
needed
foreign
soldiers
to
guard
him
william
was
now
lawful
king
of
the
english
so
far
as
outward
ceremonies
could
make
him
so
but
he
knew
well
how
far
he
was
from
having
won
real
kingly
authority
over
the
whole
kingdom
hardly
a
third
part
of
the
land
was
in
his
obedience
he
had
still
as
he
doubtless
knew
to
win
his
realm
with
the
edge
of
the
sword
but
he
could
now
go
forth
to
further
conquests
not
as
a
foreign
invader
but
as
the
king
of
the
land
putting
down
rebellion
among
his
own
subjects
if
the
men
of
northumberland
should
refuse
to
receive
him
he
could
tell
them
that
he
was
their
lawful
king
anointed
by
their
own
archbishop
it
was
sound
policy
to
act
as
king
of
the
whole
land
to
exercise
a
semblance
of
authority
where
he
had
none
in
fact
and
in
truth
he
was
king
of
the
whole
land
so
far
as
there
was
no
other
king
the
unconquered
parts
of
the
land
were
in
no
mood
to
submit
but
they
could
not
agree
on
any
common
plan
of
resistance
under
any
common
leader
some
were
still
for
edgar
some
for
sons
some
for
swegen
of
denmark
edwin
and
morkere
doubtless
were
for
themselves
if
one
common
leader
could
have
been
found
even
now
the
throne
of
the
foreign
king
would
have
been
in
no
small
danger
but
no
such
leader
came
men
stood
still
or
resisted
piecemeal
so
the
land
was
conquered
piecemeal
and
that
under
cover
of
being
brought
under
the
obedience
of
its
lawful
king
now
that
the
norman
duke
has
become
an
english
king
his
career
as
an
english
statesman
strictly
begins
and
a
wonderful
career
it
is
its
main
principle
was
to
respect
formal
legality
wherever
he
could
all
purposes
were
to
be
carried
out
as
far
as
possible
under
cover
of
strict
adherence
to
the
law
of
the
land
of
which
he
had
become
the
lawful
ruler
he
had
sworn
at
his
crowning
to
keep
the
laws
of
the
land
and
to
rule
his
kingdom
as
well
as
any
king
that
had
gone
before
him
and
assuredly
he
meant
to
keep
his
oath
but
a
foreign
king
at
the
head
of
a
foreign
army
and
who
had
his
foreign
followers
to
reward
could
keep
that
oath
only
in
its
letter
and
not
in
its
spirit
but
it
is
wonderful
how
nearly
he
came
to
keep
it
in
the
letter
he
contrived
to
do
his
most
oppressive
acts
to
deprive
englishmen
of
their
lands
and
offices
and
to
part
them
out
among
strangers
under
cover
of
english
law
he
could
do
this
a
smaller
man
would
either
have
failed
to
carry
out
his
purposes
at
all
or
he
could
have
carried
them
out
only
by
reckless
violence
when
we
examine
the
administration
of
william
more
in
detail
we
shall
see
that
its
effects
in
the
long
run
were
rather
to
preserve
than
to
destroy
our
ancient
institutions
he
knew
the
strength
of
legal
fictions
by
legal
fictions
he
conquered
and
he
ruled
but
every
legal
fiction
is
outward
homage
to
the
principle
of
law
an
outward
protest
against
unlawful
violence
that
england
underwent
a
norman
conquest
did
in
the
end
only
make
her
the
more
truly
england
but
that
this
could
be
was
because
that
conquest
was
wrought
by
the
bastard
of
falaise
and
by
none
other
chapter
viii
the
conquest
of
england
december
the
coronation
of
william
had
its
effect
in
a
moment
it
made
him
really
king
over
part
of
england
it
put
him
into
a
new
position
with
regard
to
the
rest
as
soon
as
there
was
a
king
men
flocked
to
swear
oaths
to
him
and
become
his
men
they
came
from
shires
where
he
had
no
real
authority
it
was
most
likely
now
rather
than
at
berkhampstead
that
edwin
and
morkere
at
last
made
up
their
minds
to
acknowledge
some
king
they
became
men
and
received
again
their
lands
and
earldoms
as
his
grant
other
chief
men
from
the
north
also
submitted
and
received
their
lands
and
honours
again
but
edwin
and
morkere
were
not
allowed
to
go
back
to
their
earldoms
william
thought
it
safer
to
keep
them
near
himself
under
the
guise
of
was
even
promised
one
of
his
daughters
in
really
half
as
prisoners
half
as
hostages
of
the
two
other
earls
waltheof
son
of
siward
who
held
the
shires
of
northampton
and
huntingdon
and
oswulf
who
held
the
earldom
of
bernicia
or
modern
northumberland
we
hear
nothing
at
this
moment
as
for
waltheof
it
is
strange
if
he
were
not
at
senlac
it
is
strange
if
he
were
there
and
came
away
alive
but
we
only
know
that
he
was
in
allegiance
a
few
months
later
oswulf
must
have
held
out
in
some
marked
way
it
was
policy
to
act
as
king
even
where
he
had
no
means
of
carrying
out
his
kingly
orders
he
therefore
in
february
granted
the
bernician
earldom
to
an
englishman
named
copsige
who
had
acted
as
lieutenant
this
implies
the
formal
deprivation
of
oswulf
but
william
sent
no
force
with
the
new
earl
who
had
to
take
possession
as
he
could
that
is
to
say
of
two
parties
in
a
local
quarrel
one
hoped
to
strengthen
itself
by
making
use
of
name
and
william
thought
that
it
would
strengthen
his
position
to
let
at
least
his
name
be
heard
in
every
corner
of
the
kingdom
the
rest
of
the
story
stands
rather
aloof
from
the
main
history
copsige
got
possession
of
the
earldom
for
a
moment
he
was
then
killed
by
oswulf
and
his
partisans
and
oswulf
himself
was
killed
in
the
course
of
the
year
by
a
common
robber
at
christmas
william
again
granted
or
sold
the
earldom
to
another
of
the
local
chiefs
gospatric
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
exercise
direct
authority
in
those
parts
till
the
beginning
of
the
year
all
this
illustrates
general
course
crowned
king
over
the
land
he
would
first
strengthen
himself
in
that
part
of
the
kingdom
which
he
actually
held
of
the
passive
disobedience
of
other
parts
he
would
take
no
present
notice
in
northern
and
central
england
william
could
exercise
no
authority
but
those
lands
were
not
in
arms
against
him
nor
did
they
acknowledge
any
other
king
their
earls
now
his
earls
were
his
favoured
courtiers
he
could
afford
to
be
satisfied
with
this
nominal
kingship
till
a
fit
opportunity
came
to
make
it
real
he
could
afford
to
lend
his
name
to
the
local
enterprise
of
copsige
it
would
at
least
be
another
count
against
the
men
of
bernicia
that
they
had
killed
the
earl
whom
king
william
gave
them
meanwhile
william
was
taking
very
practical
possession
in
the
shires
where
late
events
had
given
him
real
authority
his
policy
was
to
assert
his
rights
in
the
strongest
form
but
to
show
his
mildness
and
good
will
by
refraining
from
carrying
them
out
to
the
uttermost
by
right
of
conquest
william
claimed
nothing
he
had
come
to
take
his
crown
and
he
had
unluckily
met
with
some
opposition
in
taking
it
the
crown
lands
of
king
edward
passed
of
course
to
his
successor
as
for
the
lands
of
other
men
in
theory
all
was
forfeited
to
the
crown
the
lawful
heir
had
been
driven
to
seek
his
kingdom
in
arms
no
englishman
had
helped
him
many
englishmen
had
fought
against
him
all
then
were
directly
or
indirectly
traitors
the
king
might
lawfully
deal
with
the
lands
of
all
as
his
own
but
in
the
greater
part
of
the
kingdom
it
was
impossible
in
no
part
was
it
prudent
to
carry
out
this
doctrine
in
its
fulness
a
passage
in
domesday
compared
with
a
passage
in
the
english
chronicles
shows
that
soon
after
coronation
the
english
as
a
body
within
the
lands
already
conquered
redeemed
their
lands
they
bought
them
back
at
a
price
and
held
them
as
a
fresh
grant
from
king
william
some
special
offenders
living
and
dead
were
exempted
from
this
favour
the
king
took
to
himself
the
estates
of
the
house
of
godwine
save
those
of
edith
the
widow
of
his
revered
predecessor
whom
it
was
his
policy
to
treat
with
all
honour
the
lands
too
of
those
who
had
died
on
senlac
were
granted
back
to
their
heirs
only
of
special
favour
sometimes
under
the
name
of
alms
thus
from
the
beginning
of
his
reign
william
began
to
make
himself
richer
than
any
king
that
had
been
before
him
in
england
or
than
any
other
western
king
of
his
day
he
could
both
punish
his
enemies
and
reward
his
friends
much
of
what
he
took
he
kept
much
he
granted
away
mainly
to
his
foreign
followers
but
sometimes
also
to
englishmen
who
had
in
any
way
won
his
favour
wiggod
of
wallingford
was
one
of
the
very
few
englishmen
who
kept
and
received
estates
which
put
them
alongside
of
the
great
norman
landowners
the
doctrine
that
all
land
was
held
of
the
king
was
now
put
into
a
practical
shape
all
englishmen
and
strangers
not
only
became
subjects
but
his
men
and
his
grantees
thus
he
went
on
during
his
whole
reign
there
was
no
sudden
change
from
the
old
state
of
things
to
the
new
after
the
general
redemption
of
lands
gradually
carried
out
as
power
advanced
no
general
blow
was
dealt
at
englishmen
as
such
they
were
not
like
some
conquered
nations
formally
degraded
or
put
under
any
legal
incapacities
in
their
own
land
william
simply
distinguished
between
his
loyal
and
his
disloyal
subjects
and
used
his
opportunities
for
punishing
the
disloyal
and
rewarding
the
loyal
such
punishments
and
rewards
naturally
took
the
shape
of
confiscations
and
grants
of
land
if
punishment
was
commonly
the
lot
of
the
englishman
and
reward
was
the
lot
of
the
stranger
that
was
only
because
king
william
treated
all
men
as
they
deserved
most
englishmen
were
disloyal
most
strangers
were
loyal
but
disloyal
strangers
and
loyal
englishmen
fared
according
to
their
deserts
the
final
result
of
this
process
begun
now
and
steadily
carried
on
was
that
by
the
end
of
reign
the
foreign
king
was
surrounded
by
a
body
of
foreign
landowners
and
of
foreign
birth
when
in
the
early
days
of
his
conquest
he
gathered
round
him
the
great
men
of
his
realm
it
was
still
an
english
assembly
with
a
sprinkling
of
strangers
by
the
end
of
his
reign
it
had
changed
step
by
step
into
an
assembly
of
strangers
with
a
sprinkling
of
englishmen
this
revolution
which
practically
transferred
the
greater
part
of
the
soil
of
england
to
the
hands
of
strangers
was
great
indeed
but
it
must
not
be
mistaken
for
a
sudden
blow
for
an
irregular
scramble
for
a
formal
proscription
of
englishmen
as
such
william
according
to
his
character
and
practice
was
able
to
do
all
this
gradually
according
to
legal
forms
and
without
drawing
any
formal
distinction
between
natives
and
strangers
all
land
was
held
of
the
king
of
the
english
according
to
the
law
of
england
it
may
seem
strange
how
such
a
process
of
spoliation
veiled
under
a
legal
fiction
could
have
been
carried
out
without
resistance
it
was
easier
because
it
was
gradual
and
piecemeal
the
whole
country
was
not
touched
at
once
nor
even
the
whole
of
any
one
district
one
man
lost
his
land
while
his
neighbour
kept
his
and
he
who
kept
his
land
was
not
likely
to
join
in
the
possible
plots
of
the
other
and
though
the
land
had
never
seen
so
great
a
confiscation
or
one
so
largely
for
the
behoof
of
foreigners
yet
there
was
nothing
new
in
the
thing
itself
danes
had
settled
under
cnut
and
normans
and
other
frenchmen
under
edward
confiscation
of
land
was
the
everyday
punishment
for
various
public
and
private
crimes
in
any
change
such
as
we
should
call
a
change
of
ministry
as
at
the
fall
and
the
return
of
godwine
outlawry
and
forfeiture
of
lands
was
the
usual
doom
of
the
weaker
party
a
milder
doom
than
the
judicial
massacres
of
later
ages
even
a
conquest
of
england
was
nothing
new
and
william
at
this
stage
contrasted
favourably
with
cnut
whose
early
days
were
marked
by
the
death
of
not
a
few
william
at
any
rate
since
his
crowning
had
shed
the
blood
of
no
man
men
perhaps
thought
that
things
might
have
been
much
worse
and
that
they
were
not
unlikely
to
mend
anyhow
weakened
cowed
isolated
the
people
of
the
conquered
shires
submitted
humbly
to
the
will
it
needed
a
kind
of
oppression
of
which
william
himself
was
never
guilty
to
stir
them
into
actual
revolt
the
provocation
was
not
long
in
coming
within
three
months
after
his
coronation
william
paid
a
visit
to
his
native
duchy
the
ruler
of
two
states
could
not
be
always
in
either
he
owed
it
to
his
old
subjects
to
show
himself
among
them
in
his
new
character
and
his
absence
might
pass
as
a
sign
of
the
trust
he
put
in
his
new
subjects
but
the
means
which
he
took
to
secure
their
obedience
brought
out
his
one
weak
point
we
can
not
believe
that
he
really
wished
to
goad
the
people
into
rebellion
yet
the
choice
of
his
lieutenants
might
seem
almost
like
it
he
was
led
astray
by
partiality
for
his
brother
and
for
his
dearest
friend
to
bishop
ode
of
bayeux
and
to
william
the
son
of
his
early
guardian
he
gave
earldoms
that
of
kent
to
odo
that
of
hereford
to
william
the
conqueror
was
determined
before
all
things
that
his
kingdom
should
be
united
and
obedient
england
should
not
be
split
up
like
gaul
and
germany
he
would
have
no
man
in
england
whose
formal
homage
should
carry
with
it
as
little
of
practical
obedience
as
his
own
homage
to
the
king
of
the
french
a
norman
earl
of
all
wessex
or
all
mercia
might
strive
after
such
a
position
william
therefore
forsook
the
old
practice
of
dividing
the
whole
kingdom
into
earldoms
in
the
peaceful
central
shires
he
would
himself
rule
through
his
sheriffs
and
other
immediate
officers
he
would
appoint
earls
only
in
dangerous
border
districts
where
they
were
needed
as
military
commanders
all
earls
were
in
fact
guardians
of
a
march
or
frontier
ode
had
to
keep
kent
against
attacks
from
the
continent
william
had
to
keep
herefordshire
against
the
welsh
and
the
independent
english
this
last
shire
had
its
own
local
warfare
authority
did
not
yet
reach
over
all
the
shires
beyond
london
and
hereford
but
harold
had
allowed
some
of
norman
favourites
to
keep
power
there
hereford
then
and
part
of
its
shire
formed
an
isolated
part
of
dominions
while
the
lands
around
remained
unsubdued
william
had
to
guard
this
dangerous
land
as
earl
but
during
the
absence
both
he
and
ode
received
larger
commissions
as
viceroys
over
the
whole
kingdom
ode
guarded
the
south
and
william
the
north
and
norwich
a
town
dangerous
from
its
easy
communication
with
denmark
was
specially
under
his
care
the
nominal
earls
of
the
rest
of
the
land
edwin
morkere
and
waltheof
with
edgar
king
of
a
moment
archbishop
stigand
and
a
number
of
other
chief
men
william
took
with
him
to
normandy
nominally
his
cherished
friends
and
guests
they
went
in
truth
as
one
of
the
english
chroniclers
calls
them
as
hostages
stay
in
normandy
lasted
about
six
months
it
was
chiefly
devoted
to
rejoicings
and
religious
ceremonies
but
partly
to
norman
legislation
rich
gifts
from
the
spoils
of
england
were
given
to
the
churches
of
normandy
gifts
richer
still
were
sent
to
the
church
of
rome
whose
favour
had
wrought
so
much
for
william
in
exchange
for
the
banner
of
saint
peter
standard
of
the
was
sent
as
an
offering
to
the
head
of
all
churches
while
william
was
in
normandy
archbishop
maurilius
of
rouen
died
the
whole
duchy
named
lanfranc
as
his
successor
but
he
declined
the
post
and
was
himself
sent
to
rome
to
bring
the
pallium
for
the
new
archbishop
john
a
kinsman
of
the
ducal
house
lanfranc
doubtless
refused
the
see
of
rouen
only
because
he
was
designed
for
a
yet
greater
post
in
england
the
subtlest
diplomatist
in
europe
was
not
sent
to
rome
merely
to
ask
for
the
pallium
for
archbishop
john
meanwhile
choice
of
lieutenants
bore
its
fruit
in
england
they
wrought
such
oppression
as
william
himself
never
wrought
the
inferior
leaders
did
as
they
thought
good
and
the
two
earls
restrained
them
not
the
earls
meanwhile
were
in
one
point
there
faithfully
carrying
out
the
policy
of
their
master
in
the
building
of
castles
a
work
which
specially
when
the
work
of
ode
and
william
is
always
spoken
of
by
the
native
writers
with
marked
horror
the
castles
were
the
badges
and
the
instruments
of
the
conquest
the
special
means
of
holding
the
land
in
bondage
meanwhile
tumults
broke
forth
in
various
parts
the
slaughter
of
copsige
earl
in
northumberland
took
place
about
the
time
of
the
sailing
for
normandy
in
independent
herefordshire
the
leading
englishman
in
those
parts
eadric
whom
the
normans
called
the
allied
himself
with
the
welsh
harried
the
obedient
lands
and
threatened
the
castle
of
hereford
nothing
was
done
on
either
side
beyond
harrying
and
skirmishes
but
corner
of
the
land
remained
unsubdued
the
men
of
kent
made
a
strange
foreign
alliance
with
eustace
of
boulogne
the
of
edward
the
man
whose
deeds
had
led
to
the
great
movement
of
reign
to
the
banishment
and
the
return
of
godwine
he
had
fought
against
england
on
senlac
and
was
one
of
four
who
had
dealt
the
last
blow
to
the
wounded
harold
but
the
oppression
of
ode
made
the
kentishmen
glad
to
seek
any
help
against
him
eustace
now
enemy
came
over
and
gave
help
in
an
unsuccessful
attack
on
dover
castle
meanwhile
in
the
obedient
shires
men
were
making
ready
for
revolt
in
the
unsubdued
lands
they
were
making
ready
for
more
active
defence
many
went
beyond
sea
to
ask
for
foreign
help
specially
in
the
kindred
lands
of
denmark
and
northern
germany
against
this
threatening
movement
strength
lay
in
the
incapacity
of
his
enemies
for
combined
action
the
whole
land
never
rose
at
once
and
danish
help
did
not
come
at
the
times
or
in
the
shape
when
it
could
have
done
most
good
the
news
of
these
movements
brought
william
back
to
england
in
december
he
kept
the
midwinter
feast
and
assembly
at
westminster
there
the
absent
eustace
was
by
a
characteristic
stroke
of
policy
arraigned
as
a
traitor
he
was
a
foreign
prince
against
whom
the
duke
of
the
normans
might
have
led
a
norman
army
but
he
had
also
become
an
english
landowner
and
in
that
character
he
was
accountable
to
the
king
and
witan
of
england
he
suffered
the
punishment
of
confiscation
of
lands
afterwards
he
contrived
to
win
back
favour
and
he
left
great
english
possessions
to
his
second
wife
and
his
son
another
stroke
of
policy
was
to
send
an
embassy
to
denmark
to
ward
off
the
hostile
purposes
of
swegen
and
to
choose
as
ambassador
an
english
prelate
who
had
been
in
high
favour
with
both
edward
and
harold
æthelsige
abbot
of
ramsey
it
came
perhaps
of
his
mission
that
swegen
practically
did
nothing
for
two
years
the
own
life
was
a
chequered
one
he
lost
favour
and
sought
shelter
in
denmark
he
again
regained
by
some
service
at
the
danish
died
in
possession
of
his
abbey
it
is
instructive
to
see
how
in
this
same
assembly
william
bestowed
several
great
offices
the
earldom
of
northumberland
was
vacant
by
the
slaughter
of
two
earls
the
bishopric
of
dorchester
by
the
peaceful
death
of
its
bishop
william
had
no
real
authority
in
any
part
of
northumberland
or
in
more
than
a
small
part
of
the
diocese
of
dorchester
but
he
dealt
with
both
earldom
and
bishopric
as
in
his
own
power
it
was
now
that
he
granted
northumberland
to
gospatric
the
appointment
to
the
bishopric
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
system
englishmen
were
now
to
give
way
step
by
step
to
strangers
in
the
highest
offices
and
greatest
estates
of
the
land
he
had
already
made
two
norman
earls
but
they
were
to
act
as
military
commanders
he
now
made
an
english
earl
whose
earldom
was
likely
to
be
either
nominal
or
fatal
the
appointment
of
remigius
of
fécamp
to
the
see
of
dorchester
was
of
more
real
importance
it
is
the
beginning
of
ecclesiastical
reign
the
first
step
in
scheme
of
making
the
church
his
instrument
in
keeping
down
the
conquered
while
william
lived
no
englishman
was
appointed
to
a
bishopric
as
bishoprics
became
vacant
by
death
foreigners
were
nominated
and
excuses
were
often
found
for
hastening
a
vacancy
by
deprivation
at
the
end
of
reign
one
english
bishop
only
was
left
with
abbots
as
having
less
temporal
power
than
bishops
the
rule
was
less
strict
foreigners
were
preferred
but
englishmen
were
not
wholly
shut
out
and
the
general
process
of
confiscation
and
regrant
of
lands
was
vigorously
carried
out
the
kentish
revolt
and
the
general
movement
must
have
led
to
many
forfeitures
and
to
further
grants
to
loyal
men
of
either
nation
as
the
english
chronicles
pithily
puts
it
king
gave
away
every
william
could
soon
grant
lands
in
new
parts
of
england
in
february
he
for
the
first
time
went
forth
to
warfare
with
those
whom
he
called
his
subjects
but
who
had
never
submitted
to
him
in
the
course
of
the
year
a
large
part
of
england
was
in
arms
against
him
but
there
was
no
concert
the
west
rose
and
the
north
rose
but
the
west
rose
first
and
the
north
did
not
rise
till
the
west
had
been
subdued
western
england
threw
off
the
purely
passive
state
which
had
lasted
through
the
year
hitherto
each
side
had
left
the
other
alone
but
now
the
men
of
the
west
made
ready
for
a
more
direct
opposition
to
the
foreign
government
if
they
could
not
drive
william
out
of
what
he
had
already
won
they
would
at
least
keep
him
from
coming
any
further
exeter
the
greatest
city
of
the
west
was
the
natural
centre
of
resistance
the
smaller
towns
at
least
of
devonshire
and
dorset
entered
into
a
league
with
the
capital
they
seem
to
have
aimed
like
italian
cities
in
the
like
case
at
the
formation
of
a
civic
confederation
which
might
perhaps
find
it
expedient
to
acknowledge
william
as
an
external
lord
but
which
would
maintain
perfect
internal
independence
still
as
gytha
widow
of
godwine
mother
of
harold
was
within
the
walls
of
exeter
the
movement
was
doubtless
also
in
some
sort
on
behalf
of
the
house
of
godwine
in
any
case
exeter
and
the
lands
and
towns
in
its
alliance
with
exeter
strengthened
themselves
in
every
way
against
attack
things
were
not
now
as
on
the
day
of
senlac
when
englishmen
on
their
own
soil
withstood
one
who
however
he
might
cloke
his
enterprise
was
to
them
simply
a
foreign
invader
but
william
was
not
yet
as
he
was
in
some
later
struggles
the
king
of
the
whole
land
whom
all
had
acknowledged
and
opposition
to
whom
was
in
form
rebellion
he
now
held
an
intermediate
position
he
was
still
an
invader
for
exeter
had
never
submitted
to
him
but
the
crowned
king
of
the
english
peacefully
ruling
over
many
shires
was
hardly
a
mere
invader
resistance
to
him
would
have
the
air
of
rebellion
in
the
eyes
of
many
besides
william
and
his
flatterers
and
they
could
not
see
what
we
plainly
see
what
william
perhaps
dimly
saw
that
it
was
in
the
long
run
better
for
exeter
or
any
other
part
of
england
to
share
even
in
conquest
the
fate
of
the
whole
land
rather
than
to
keep
on
a
precarious
independence
to
the
aggravation
of
the
common
bondage
this
we
feel
throughout
william
with
whatever
motive
is
fighting
for
the
unity
of
england
we
therefore
can
not
seriously
regret
his
successes
but
none
the
less
honour
is
due
to
the
men
whom
the
duty
of
the
moment
bade
to
withstand
him
they
could
not
see
things
as
we
see
them
by
the
light
of
eight
hundred
years
the
movement
evidently
stirred
several
shires
but
it
is
only
of
exeter
that
we
hear
any
details
william
never
used
force
till
he
had
tried
negotiation
he
sent
messengers
demanding
that
the
citizens
should
take
oaths
to
him
and
receive
him
within
their
walls
the
choice
lay
now
between
unconditional
submission
and
valiant
resistance
but
the
chief
men
of
the
city
chose
a
middle
course
which
could
gain
nothing
they
answered
as
an
italian
city
might
have
answered
a
swabian
emperor
they
would
not
receive
the
king
within
their
walls
they
would
take
no
oaths
to
him
but
they
would
pay
him
the
tribute
which
they
had
paid
to
earlier
kings
that
is
they
would
not
have
him
as
king
but
only
as
overlord
over
a
commonwealth
otherwise
independent
answer
was
short
is
not
my
custom
to
take
subjects
on
those
he
set
out
on
his
march
his
policy
was
to
overcome
the
rebellious
english
by
the
arms
of
the
loyal
english
he
called
out
the
the
militia
of
all
or
some
of
the
shires
under
his
obedience
they
answered
his
call
to
disobey
it
would
have
needed
greater
courage
than
to
wield
the
axe
on
senlac
this
use
of
english
troops
became
custom
in
all
his
later
wars
in
england
and
on
the
mainland
but
of
course
he
did
not
trust
to
english
troops
only
the
plan
of
the
campaign
was
that
which
had
won
le
mans
and
london
the
towns
of
dorset
were
frightfully
harried
on
the
march
to
the
capital
of
the
west
disunion
at
once
broke
out
the
leading
men
in
exeter
sent
to
offer
unconditional
submission
and
to
give
hostages
but
the
commonalty
disowned
the
agreement
notwithstanding
the
blinding
of
one
of
the
hostages
before
the
walls
they
defended
the
city
valiantly
for
eighteen
days
it
was
only
when
the
walls
began
to
crumble
away
beneath
that
the
men
of
exeter
at
last
submitted
to
his
mercy
and
mercy
could
be
trusted
no
man
was
harmed
in
life
limb
or
goods
but
to
hinder
further
revolts
a
castle
was
at
once
begun
and
the
payments
made
by
the
city
to
the
king
were
largely
raised
gytha
when
the
city
yielded
withdrew
to
the
steep
holm
and
thence
to
flanders
her
grandsons
fled
to
ireland
from
thence
in
the
course
of
the
same
year
and
the
next
they
twice
landed
in
somerset
and
devonshire
the
irish
danes
who
followed
them
could
not
be
kept
back
from
plunder
englishmen
as
well
as
normans
withstood
them
and
the
hopes
of
the
house
of
godwine
came
to
an
end
on
the
conquest
of
exeter
followed
the
submission
of
the
whole
west
all
the
land
south
of
the
thames
was
now
in
obedience
gloucestershire
seems
to
have
submitted
at
the
same
time
the
submission
of
worcestershire
is
without
date
a
vast
confiscation
of
lands
followed
most
likely
by
slow
degrees
its
most
memorable
feature
is
that
nearly
all
cornwall
was
granted
to
brother
robert
count
of
mortain
his
vast
estate
grew
into
the
famous
cornish
earldom
and
duchy
of
later
times
southern
england
was
now
conquered
and
as
the
north
had
not
stirred
during
the
stirring
of
the
west
the
whole
land
was
outwardly
at
peace
william
now
deemed
it
safe
to
bring
his
wife
to
share
his
new
greatness
the
duchess
matilda
came
over
to
england
and
was
hallowed
to
queen
at
westminster
by
archbishop
ealdred
we
may
believe
that
no
part
of
his
success
gave
william
truer
pleasure
but
the
presence
of
the
lady
was
important
in
another
way
it
was
doubtless
by
design
that
she
gave
birth
on
english
soil
to
her
youngest
son
afterwards
the
renowned
king
henry
the
first
he
alone
of
children
was
in
any
sense
an
englishman
born
on
english
ground
son
of
a
crowned
king
and
his
lady
englishmen
looked
on
him
as
a
countryman
and
his
father
saw
the
wisdom
of
encouraging
such
a
feeling
henry
surnamed
in
after
days
the
clerk
was
brought
up
with
special
care
he
was
trained
in
many
branches
of
learning
unusual
among
the
princes
of
his
age
among
them
in
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
tongue
of
his
native
land
the
campaign
of
exeter
is
of
all
english
campaigns
the
richest
in
political
teaching
we
see
how
near
the
cities
of
england
came
for
a
we
shall
presently
see
a
chief
city
of
northern
running
the
same
course
as
the
cities
of
italy
and
provence
signs
of
the
same
tendency
may
sometimes
be
suspected
elsewhere
but
they
are
not
so
clearly
revealed
later
campaigns
are
of
the
deepest
importance
in
english
history
they
are
far
richer
in
recorded
personal
actors
than
the
siege
of
exeter
but
they
hardly
throw
so
much
light
on
the
character
of
william
and
his
statesmanship
william
is
throughout
ever
ready
but
never
willing
to
wait
when
waiting
seems
the
best
ready
to
accept
a
nominal
success
when
there
is
a
chance
of
turning
it
into
a
real
one
but
never
accepting
nominal
success
as
a
cover
for
defeat
never
losing
an
inch
of
ground
without
at
once
taking
measures
to
recover
it
by
this
means
he
has
in
the
former
part
of
extended
his
dominion
to
the
end
before
the
end
of
the
year
he
extends
it
to
the
tees
in
the
next
year
he
has
indeed
to
win
it
back
again
but
he
does
win
it
back
and
more
also
early
in
he
was
at
last
in
deed
as
well
as
in
name
full
king
over
all
england
the
north
was
making
ready
for
war
while
the
war
in
the
west
went
on
but
one
part
of
england
did
nothing
to
help
the
other
in
the
summer
the
movement
in
the
north
took
shape
the
nominal
earls
edwin
morkere
and
gospatric
with
the
ætheling
edgar
and
others
left
court
to
put
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
movement
edwin
was
specially
aggrieved
because
the
king
had
promised
him
one
of
his
daughters
in
marriage
but
had
delayed
giving
her
to
him
the
english
formed
alliances
with
the
dependent
princes
of
wales
and
scotland
and
stood
ready
to
withstand
any
attack
william
set
forth
as
he
had
taken
exeter
he
took
warwick
perhaps
leicester
this
was
enough
for
edwin
and
morkere
they
submitted
and
were
again
received
to
favour
more
valiant
spirits
withdrew
northward
ready
to
defend
durham
as
the
last
shelter
of
independence
while
edgar
and
gospatric
fled
to
the
court
of
malcolm
of
scotland
william
went
on
receiving
the
submission
of
nottingham
and
york
thence
he
turned
southward
receiving
on
his
way
the
submission
of
lincoln
cambridge
and
huntingdon
again
he
deemed
it
his
policy
to
establish
his
power
in
the
lands
which
he
had
already
won
rather
than
to
jeopard
matters
by
at
once
pressing
farther
in
the
conquered
towns
he
built
castles
and
he
placed
permanent
garrisons
in
each
district
by
granting
estates
to
his
norman
and
other
followers
different
towns
and
districts
suffered
in
different
degrees
according
doubtless
to
the
measure
of
resistance
met
with
in
each
lincoln
and
lincolnshire
were
on
the
whole
favourably
treated
an
unusual
number
of
englishmen
kept
lands
and
offices
in
city
and
shire
at
leicester
and
northampton
and
in
their
shires
the
wide
confiscations
and
great
destruction
of
houses
point
to
a
stout
resistance
and
though
durham
was
still
untouched
and
though
william
had
assuredly
no
present
purpose
of
attacking
scotland
he
found
it
expedient
to
receive
with
all
favour
a
nominal
submission
brought
from
the
king
of
scots
by
the
hands
of
the
bishop
of
durham
if
policy
ever
seems
less
prudent
than
usual
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
year
the
extreme
north
still
stood
out
william
had
twice
commissioned
english
earls
of
northumberland
to
take
possession
if
they
could
he
now
risked
the
dangerous
step
of
sending
a
stranger
robert
of
comines
was
appointed
to
the
earldom
forfeited
by
the
flight
of
gospatric
while
it
was
still
winter
he
went
with
his
force
to
durham
by
help
of
the
bishop
he
was
admitted
into
the
city
but
he
and
his
whole
force
were
cut
off
by
the
people
of
durham
and
its
neighbourhood
expedition
in
short
led
only
to
a
revolt
of
york
where
edgar
was
received
and
siege
was
laid
to
the
castle
william
marched
in
person
with
all
speed
he
relieved
the
castle
he
recovered
the
city
and
strengthened
it
by
a
second
castle
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
still
he
thought
it
prudent
to
take
no
present
steps
against
durham
soon
after
this
came
the
second
attempt
of
sons
in
the
west
later
in
this
year
final
warfare
for
the
kingdom
began
in
august
the
help
from
denmark
came
swegen
sent
his
brother
osbeorn
and
his
sons
harold
and
cnut
at
the
head
of
the
whole
strength
of
denmark
and
of
other
northern
lands
if
the
two
enterprises
of
sons
had
been
planned
in
concert
with
their
danish
kinsmen
the
invaders
or
deliverers
from
opposite
sides
had
failed
to
act
together
nor
are
own
objects
quite
clear
he
sought
to
deliver
england
from
william
and
his
normans
but
it
is
not
so
plain
in
whose
interest
he
acted
he
would
naturally
seek
the
english
crown
for
himself
or
for
one
of
his
sons
the
sons
of
harold
he
would
rather
make
earls
than
kings
but
he
could
feel
no
interest
in
the
kingship
of
edgar
yet
when
the
danish
fleet
entered
the
humber
and
the
whole
force
of
the
north
came
to
meet
it
the
english
host
had
the
heir
of
cerdic
at
its
head
it
is
now
that
waltheof
the
son
of
siward
earl
of
northampton
and
huntingdon
first
stands
out
as
a
leading
actor
gospatric
too
was
there
but
this
time
not
edwin
and
morkere
danes
and
english
joined
and
marched
upon
york
the
city
was
occupied
the
castles
were
taken
the
norman
commanders
were
made
prisoners
but
not
till
they
had
set
fire
to
the
city
and
burned
the
greater
part
of
it
along
with
the
metropolitan
minster
it
is
amazing
to
read
that
after
breaking
down
the
castles
the
english
host
dispersed
and
the
danish
fleet
withdrew
into
the
humber
england
was
again
ruined
by
lack
of
concert
the
news
of
the
coming
of
the
danes
led
only
to
isolated
movements
which
were
put
down
piecemeal
the
men
of
somerset
and
dorset
and
the
men
of
devonshire
and
cornwall
were
put
down
separately
and
the
movement
in
somerset
was
largely
put
down
by
english
troops
the
citizens
of
exeter
as
well
as
the
norman
garrison
of
the
castle
stood
a
siege
on
behalf
of
william
a
rising
on
the
welsh
border
under
eadric
led
only
to
the
burning
of
shrewsbury
a
rising
in
staffordshire
was
held
by
william
to
call
for
his
own
presence
but
he
first
marched
into
lindesey
and
drove
the
crews
of
the
danish
ships
across
into
holderness
there
he
left
two
norman
leaders
one
of
them
his
brother
robert
of
mortain
and
cornwall
he
then
went
westward
and
subdued
staffordshire
and
marched
towards
york
by
way
of
nottingham
a
constrained
delay
by
the
aire
gave
him
an
opportunity
for
negotiation
with
the
danish
leaders
osbeorn
took
bribes
to
forsake
the
english
cause
and
william
reached
and
entered
york
without
resistance
he
restored
the
castles
and
kept
his
christmas
in
the
city
and
now
william
forsook
his
usual
policy
of
clemency
the
northern
shires
had
been
too
hard
to
win
to
weaken
them
he
decreed
a
merciless
harrying
of
the
whole
land
the
direct
effects
of
which
were
seen
for
many
years
and
which
left
its
mark
on
english
history
for
ages
till
the
growth
of
modern
industry
reversed
the
relative
position
of
northern
and
southern
england
the
old
northumbrian
kingdom
never
fully
recovered
from
the
blow
dealt
by
william
and
remained
the
most
backward
part
of
the
land
herein
comes
one
of
the
most
remarkable
results
of
coming
his
greatest
work
was
to
make
england
a
kingdom
which
no
man
henceforth
thought
of
dividing
but
the
circumstances
of
his
conquest
of
northern
england
ruled
that
for
several
centuries
the
unity
of
england
should
take
the
form
of
a
distinct
preponderance
of
southern
england
over
northern
reign
strengthened
every
tendency
that
way
chiefly
by
the
fearful
blow
now
dealt
to
the
physical
strength
and
of
the
northern
shires
from
one
side
indeed
the
norman
conquest
was
truly
a
saxon
conquest
the
king
of
london
and
winchester
became
more
fully
than
ever
king
over
the
whole
land
the
conqueror
had
now
only
to
gather
in
what
was
still
left
to
conquer
but
as
military
exploits
none
are
more
memorable
than
the
winter
marches
which
put
william
into
full
possession
of
england
the
lands
beyond
tees
still
held
out
in
january
he
set
forth
to
subdue
them
the
earls
waltheof
and
gospatric
made
their
submission
waltheof
in
person
gospatric
by
proxy
william
restored
both
of
them
to
their
earldoms
and
received
waltheof
to
his
highest
favour
giving
him
his
niece
judith
in
marriage
but
he
systematically
wasted
the
land
as
he
had
wasted
yorkshire
he
then
returned
to
york
and
thence
set
forth
to
subdue
the
last
city
and
shire
that
held
out
a
fearful
march
led
him
to
the
one
remaining
fragment
of
free
england
the
unconquered
land
of
chester
we
know
not
how
chester
fell
but
the
land
was
not
won
without
fighting
and
a
frightful
harrying
was
the
punishment
in
all
this
we
see
a
distinct
stage
of
moral
downfall
in
the
character
of
the
conqueror
yet
it
is
thoroughly
characteristic
all
is
calm
deliberate
politic
william
will
have
no
more
revolts
and
he
will
at
any
cost
make
the
land
incapable
of
revolt
yet
as
ever
there
is
no
blood
shed
save
in
battle
if
men
died
of
hunger
that
was
not
doing
nay
charitable
people
like
abbot
æthelwig
of
evesham
might
do
what
they
could
to
help
the
sufferers
but
the
lawful
king
kept
so
long
out
of
his
kingdom
would
at
whatever
price
be
king
over
the
whole
land
and
the
great
harrying
of
the
northern
shires
was
the
price
paid
for
kingship
over
them
at
chester
the
work
was
ended
which
had
begun
at
pevensey
less
than
three
years
and
a
half
with
intervals
of
peace
had
made
the
norman
invader
king
over
all
england
he
had
won
the
kingdom
he
had
now
to
keep
it
he
had
for
seventeen
years
to
deal
with
revolts
on
both
sides
of
the
sea
with
revolts
both
of
englishmen
and
of
his
own
followers
but
in
england
his
power
was
never
shaken
in
england
he
never
knew
defeat
his
english
enemies
he
had
subdued
the
danes
were
allowed
to
remain
and
in
some
sort
to
help
in
his
work
by
plundering
during
the
winter
the
king
now
marched
to
the
salisbury
of
that
day
the
deeply
fenced
hill
of
old
sarum
the
men
who
had
conquered
england
were
reviewed
in
the
great
plain
and
received
their
rewards
some
among
them
had
by
failures
of
duty
during
the
winter
marches
lost
their
right
to
reward
their
punishment
was
to
remain
under
arms
forty
days
longer
than
their
comrades
william
could
trust
himself
to
the
very
mutineers
whom
he
had
picked
out
for
punishment
he
had
now
to
begin
his
real
reign
and
the
champion
of
the
church
had
before
all
things
to
reform
the
evil
customs
of
the
benighted
islanders
and
to
give
them
shepherds
of
their
souls
who
might
guide
them
in
the
right
way
chapter
ix
the
settlement
of
england
england
was
now
fully
conquered
and
william
could
for
a
moment
sit
down
quietly
to
the
rule
of
the
kingdom
that
he
had
won
the
time
that
immediately
followed
is
spoken
of
as
a
time
of
comparative
quiet
and
of
less
oppression
than
the
times
either
before
or
after
before
and
after
warfare
on
one
side
of
the
sea
or
the
other
was
the
main
business
hitherto
william
has
been
winning
his
kingdom
in
arms
afterwards
he
was
more
constantly
called
away
to
his
foreign
dominions
and
his
absence
always
led
to
greater
oppression
in
england
just
now
he
had
a
moment
of
repose
when
he
could
give
his
mind
to
the
affairs
of
church
and
state
in
england
peace
indeed
was
not
quite
unbroken
events
were
tending
to
that
famous
revolt
in
the
fenland
which
is
perhaps
the
best
remembered
part
of
reign
but
even
this
movement
was
merely
local
and
did
not
seriously
interfere
with
government
he
was
now
striving
to
settle
the
land
in
peace
and
to
make
his
rule
as
little
grievous
to
the
conquered
as
might
be
the
harrying
of
northumberland
showed
that
he
now
shrank
from
no
harshness
that
would
serve
his
ends
but
from
mere
purposeless
oppression
he
was
still
free
nor
was
he
ever
inclined
to
needless
change
or
to
that
scorn
of
the
conquered
which
meaner
conquerors
have
often
shown
he
clearly
wished
both
to
change
and
to
oppress
as
little
as
he
could
this
is
a
side
of
him
which
has
been
greatly
misunderstood
largely
through
the
book
that
passes
for
the
history
of
ingulf
abbot
of
crowland
ingulf
was
english
secretary
a
real
history
of
his
writing
would
be
most
precious
but
the
book
that
goes
by
his
name
is
a
forgery
not
older
than
the
fourteenth
century
and
is
in
all
points
contradicted
by
the
genuine
documents
of
the
time
thus
the
forger
makes
william
try
to
abolish
the
english
language
and
order
the
use
of
french
in
legal
writings
this
is
pure
fiction
the
truth
is
that
from
the
time
of
coming
english
goes
out
of
use
in
legal
writings
but
only
gradually
and
not
in
favour
of
french
ever
since
the
coming
of
augustine
english
and
latin
had
been
alternative
tongues
after
the
coming
of
william
english
becomes
less
usual
and
in
the
course
of
the
twelfth
century
it
goes
out
of
use
in
favour
of
latin
there
are
no
french
documents
till
the
thirteenth
century
and
in
that
century
english
begins
again
instead
of
abolishing
the
english
tongue
william
took
care
that
his
son
should
learn
it
and
he
even
began
to
learn
it
himself
a
king
of
those
days
held
it
for
his
duty
to
hear
and
redress
his
complaints
he
had
to
go
through
the
land
and
see
for
himself
that
those
who
acted
in
his
name
did
right
among
his
people
this
earlier
kings
had
done
this
william
wished
to
do
but
he
found
his
ignorance
of
english
a
hindrance
cares
of
other
kinds
checked
his
english
studies
but
he
may
have
learned
enough
to
understand
the
meaning
of
his
own
english
charters
nor
did
william
try
as
he
is
often
imagined
to
have
done
to
root
out
the
ancient
institutions
of
england
and
to
set
up
in
their
stead
either
the
existing
institutions
of
normandy
or
some
new
institutions
of
his
own
devising
the
truth
is
that
with
william
began
a
gradual
change
in
the
laws
and
customs
of
england
undoubtedly
great
but
far
less
than
is
commonly
thought
french
names
have
often
supplanted
english
and
have
made
the
amount
of
change
seem
greater
than
it
really
was
still
much
change
did
follow
on
the
norman
conquest
and
the
norman
conquest
was
so
completely
own
act
that
all
that
came
of
it
was
in
some
sort
his
act
also
but
these
changes
were
mainly
the
gradual
results
of
the
state
of
things
which
followed
coming
they
were
but
very
slightly
the
results
of
any
formal
acts
of
his
with
a
foreign
king
and
foreigners
in
all
high
places
much
practical
change
could
not
fail
to
follow
even
where
the
letter
of
the
law
was
unchanged
still
the
practical
change
was
less
than
if
the
letter
of
the
law
had
been
changed
as
well
english
law
was
administered
by
foreign
judges
the
foreign
grantees
of
william
held
english
land
according
to
english
law
the
norman
had
no
special
position
as
a
norman
in
every
rank
except
perhaps
the
very
highest
and
the
very
lowest
he
had
englishmen
to
his
fellows
all
this
helped
to
give
the
norman
conquest
of
england
its
peculiar
character
to
give
it
an
air
of
having
swept
away
everything
english
while
its
real
work
was
to
turn
strangers
into
englishmen
and
that
character
was
impressed
on
work
by
william
himself
the
king
claiming
by
legal
right
but
driven
to
assert
his
right
by
the
sword
was
unlike
both
the
foreign
king
who
comes
in
by
peaceful
succession
and
the
foreign
king
who
comes
in
without
even
the
pretext
of
law
the
normans
too
if
born
soldiers
were
also
born
lawyers
and
no
man
was
more
deeply
impressed
with
the
legal
spirit
than
william
himself
he
loved
neither
to
change
the
law
nor
to
transgress
the
law
and
he
had
little
need
to
do
either
he
knew
how
to
make
the
law
his
instrument
and
without
either
changing
or
transgressing
it
to
use
it
to
make
himself
he
thoroughly
enjoyed
that
system
of
legal
fictions
and
official
euphemisms
which
marks
his
reign
william
himself
became
in
some
sort
an
englishman
and
those
to
whom
he
granted
english
lands
had
in
some
sort
to
become
englishmen
in
order
to
hold
them
the
norman
stepped
into
the
exact
place
of
the
englishman
whose
land
he
held
he
took
his
rights
and
his
burthens
and
disputes
about
those
rights
and
burthens
were
judged
according
to
english
law
by
the
witness
of
englishmen
reigning
over
two
races
in
one
land
william
would
be
lord
of
both
alike
able
to
use
either
against
the
other
in
case
of
need
he
would
make
the
most
of
everything
in
the
feelings
and
customs
of
either
that
tended
to
strengthen
his
own
hands
and
in
the
state
of
things
in
which
men
then
found
themselves
whatever
strengthened
hands
strengthened
law
and
order
in
his
kingdom
there
was
therefore
nothing
to
lead
william
to
make
any
large
changes
in
the
letter
of
the
english
law
the
powers
of
a
king
of
the
english
wielded
as
he
knew
how
to
wield
them
made
him
as
great
as
he
could
wish
to
be
once
granting
the
original
wrong
of
his
coming
at
all
and
bringing
a
host
of
strangers
with
him
there
is
singularly
little
to
blame
in
the
acts
of
the
conqueror
of
bloodshed
of
wanton
interference
with
law
and
usage
there
is
wonderfully
little
englishmen
and
normans
were
held
to
have
settled
down
in
peace
under
the
equal
protection
of
king
william
the
two
races
were
drawing
together
the
process
was
beginning
which
a
hundred
years
later
made
it
impossible
in
any
rank
but
the
highest
and
the
lowest
to
distinguish
norman
from
englishman
among
the
smaller
landowners
and
the
townsfolk
this
intermingling
had
already
begun
while
earls
and
bishops
were
not
yet
so
exclusively
norman
nor
had
the
free
churls
of
england
as
yet
sunk
so
low
as
at
a
later
stage
still
some
legislation
was
needed
to
settle
the
relations
of
the
two
races
king
william
proclaimed
the
of
the
law
of
king
this
phrase
has
often
been
misunderstood
it
is
a
common
form
when
peace
and
good
order
are
restored
after
a
period
of
disturbance
the
last
reign
which
is
looked
back
to
as
to
a
time
of
good
government
becomes
the
standard
of
good
government
and
it
is
agreed
between
king
and
people
between
contending
races
or
parties
that
things
shall
be
as
they
were
in
the
days
of
the
model
ruler
so
we
hear
in
normandy
of
the
renewal
of
the
law
of
rolf
and
in
england
of
the
renewal
of
the
law
of
cnut
so
at
an
earlier
time
danes
and
englishmen
agreed
in
the
renewal
of
the
law
of
edgar
so
now
normans
and
englishmen
agreed
in
the
renewal
of
the
law
of
edward
there
was
no
code
either
of
or
of
making
william
simply
bound
himself
to
rule
as
edward
had
ruled
but
in
restoring
the
law
of
king
edward
he
added
the
additions
which
i
have
decreed
for
the
advantage
of
the
people
of
the
these
few
words
are
indeed
weighty
the
little
legislation
of
reign
takes
throughout
the
shape
of
additions
nothing
old
is
repealed
a
few
new
enactments
are
set
up
by
the
side
of
the
old
ones
and
these
words
describe
not
only
actual
legislation
but
the
widest
general
effect
of
his
coming
the
norman
conquest
did
little
towards
any
direct
abolition
of
the
older
english
laws
or
institutions
but
it
set
up
some
new
institutions
alongside
of
old
ones
and
it
brought
in
not
a
few
names
habits
and
ways
of
looking
at
things
which
gradually
did
their
work
in
england
no
man
has
pulled
down
many
have
added
and
modified
our
law
is
still
the
law
of
king
edward
with
the
additions
of
king
william
some
old
institutions
took
new
names
some
new
institutions
with
new
names
sprang
up
by
the
side
of
old
ones
sometimes
the
old
has
lasted
sometimes
the
new
we
still
have
a
and
not
a
but
he
gathers
round
him
a
and
not
a
we
have
a
and
not
a
but
his
district
is
more
commonly
called
a
than
a
but
and
are
french
and
english
for
the
same
thing
and
is
simply
french
for
the
which
king
william
had
with
his
witan
the
national
assembly
of
england
has
changed
its
name
and
its
constitution
more
than
once
but
it
has
never
been
changed
by
any
sudden
revolution
never
till
later
times
by
any
formal
enactment
there
was
no
moment
when
one
kind
of
assembly
supplanted
another
and
this
has
come
because
our
conqueror
was
both
by
his
disposition
and
his
circumstances
led
to
act
as
a
preserver
and
not
as
a
destroyer
the
greatest
recorded
acts
of
william
administrative
and
legislative
come
in
the
last
days
of
his
reign
but
there
are
several
enactments
of
william
belonging
to
various
periods
of
his
reign
and
some
of
them
to
this
first
moment
of
peace
here
we
distinctly
see
william
as
an
english
statesman
as
a
statesman
who
knew
how
to
work
a
radical
change
under
conservative
forms
one
enactment
perhaps
the
earliest
of
all
provided
for
the
safety
of
the
strangers
who
had
come
with
him
to
subdue
and
to
settle
in
the
land
the
murder
of
a
norman
by
an
englishman
especially
of
a
norman
intruder
by
a
dispossessed
englishman
was
a
thing
that
doubtless
often
happened
william
therefore
provides
for
the
safety
of
those
whom
he
calls
men
whom
i
brought
with
me
or
who
have
come
after
me
that
is
the
warriors
of
senlac
exeter
and
york
these
men
are
put
within
his
own
peace
wrong
done
to
them
is
wrong
done
to
the
king
his
crown
and
dignity
if
the
murderer
can
not
be
found
the
lord
and
failing
him
the
hundred
must
make
payment
to
the
king
of
this
grew
the
presentment
of
one
of
the
few
formal
badges
of
distinction
between
the
conquering
and
the
conquered
race
its
practical
need
could
not
have
lasted
beyond
a
generation
or
two
but
it
went
on
as
a
form
ages
after
it
had
lost
all
meaning
an
unknown
corpse
unless
it
could
be
proved
that
the
dead
man
was
english
was
assumed
to
be
that
of
a
man
who
had
come
with
king
william
and
the
fine
was
levied
some
other
enactments
were
needed
when
two
nations
lived
side
by
side
in
the
same
land
as
in
earlier
times
roman
and
barbarian
each
kept
his
own
law
so
now
for
some
purposes
the
the
englishman
kept
their
own
law
this
is
chiefly
with
regard
to
the
modes
of
appealing
to
judgement
in
doubtful
cases
the
english
did
this
by
ordeal
the
normans
by
wager
of
battle
when
a
man
of
one
nation
appealed
a
man
of
the
other
the
accused
chose
the
mode
of
trial
if
an
englishman
appealed
a
frenchman
and
declined
to
prove
his
charge
either
way
the
frenchman
might
clear
himself
by
oath
but
these
privileges
were
strictly
confined
to
frenchmen
who
had
come
with
william
and
after
him
frenchmen
who
had
in
time
settled
in
england
as
the
land
of
their
own
choice
reckoned
as
englishmen
other
enactments
fresh
enactments
of
older
laws
touched
both
races
the
slave
trade
was
rife
in
its
worst
form
men
were
sold
out
of
the
land
chiefly
to
the
danes
of
ireland
earlier
kings
had
denounced
the
crime
and
earlier
bishops
had
preached
against
it
william
denounced
it
again
under
the
penalty
of
forfeiture
of
all
lands
and
goods
and
saint
wulfstan
the
bishop
of
worcester
persuaded
the
chief
offenders
englishmen
of
bristol
to
give
up
their
darling
sin
for
a
season
yet
in
the
next
reign
anselm
and
his
synod
had
once
more
to
denounce
the
crime
under
spiritual
penalties
when
they
had
no
longer
the
strong
arm
of
william
to
enforce
them
another
law
bears
more
than
all
the
personal
impress
of
william
in
it
he
at
once
on
one
side
forestalls
the
most
humane
theories
of
modern
times
and
on
the
other
sins
most
directly
against
them
his
remarkable
unwillingness
to
put
any
man
to
death
except
among
the
chances
of
the
was
to
some
extent
the
feeling
of
his
age
with
him
the
feeling
takes
the
shape
of
a
formal
law
he
forbids
the
infliction
of
death
for
any
crime
whatever
but
those
who
may
on
this
score
be
disposed
to
claim
the
conqueror
as
a
sympathizer
will
be
shocked
at
the
next
enactment
those
crimes
which
kings
less
merciful
than
william
would
have
punished
with
death
are
to
be
punished
with
loss
of
eyes
or
other
foul
and
cruel
mutilations
punishments
of
this
kind
now
seem
more
revolting
than
death
though
possibly
now
as
then
the
sufferer
himself
might
think
otherwise
but
in
those
days
to
substitute
mutilation
for
death
in
the
case
of
crimes
which
were
held
to
deserve
death
was
universally
deemed
an
act
of
mercy
grave
men
shrank
from
sending
their
out
of
the
world
perhaps
without
time
for
repentance
but
physical
sympathy
with
physical
suffering
had
little
place
in
their
minds
in
the
next
century
a
feeling
against
bodily
mutilation
gradually
comes
in
but
as
yet
the
mildest
and
most
thoughtful
men
anselm
himself
make
no
protest
against
it
when
it
is
believed
to
be
really
deserved
there
is
no
sign
of
any
general
complaint
on
this
score
the
english
chronicler
applauds
the
strict
police
of
which
mutilation
formed
a
part
and
in
one
case
he
deliberately
holds
it
to
be
the
fitting
punishment
of
the
offence
in
fact
when
penal
settlements
were
unknown
and
legal
prisons
were
few
and
loathsome
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
a
punishment
which
disabled
the
criminal
from
repeating
his
offence
in
jurisprudence
mutilation
became
the
ordinary
sentence
of
the
murderer
the
robber
the
ravisher
sometimes
also
of
english
revolters
against
power
we
must
in
short
balance
his
mercy
against
the
mercy
of
kirk
and
jeffreys
the
ground
on
which
the
english
chronicler
does
raise
his
wail
on
behalf
of
his
countrymen
is
the
special
jurisprudence
of
the
forests
and
the
extortions
of
money
with
which
he
charges
the
conqueror
in
both
these
points
the
royal
hand
became
far
heavier
under
the
norman
rule
in
both
character
grew
darker
as
he
grew
older
he
is
charged
with
unlawful
exactions
of
money
in
his
character
alike
of
sovereign
and
of
landlord
we
read
of
his
sharp
practice
in
dealing
with
the
profits
of
the
royal
demesnes
he
would
turn
out
the
tenant
to
whom
he
had
just
let
the
land
if
another
offered
a
higher
rent
but
with
regard
to
taxation
we
must
remember
that
exactions
however
heavy
at
the
time
were
a
step
in
the
direction
of
regular
government
in
those
days
all
taxation
was
disliked
direct
taking
of
the
money
by
the
king
was
deemed
an
extraordinary
resource
to
be
justified
only
by
some
extraordinary
emergency
to
buy
off
the
danes
or
to
hire
soldiers
against
them
men
long
after
still
dreamed
that
the
king
could
of
his
own
that
he
could
pay
all
expenses
of
his
court
and
government
out
of
the
rents
and
services
due
to
him
as
a
landowner
without
asking
his
people
for
anything
in
the
character
of
sovereign
demands
of
money
on
behalf
of
the
king
now
became
both
heavier
and
more
frequent
and
another
change
which
had
long
been
gradually
working
now
came
to
a
head
when
centuries
later
the
king
was
bidden
to
of
his
own
men
had
forgotten
that
the
land
of
the
king
had
once
been
the
land
of
the
nation
in
all
teutonic
communities
great
and
small
just
as
in
the
city
communities
of
greece
and
italy
the
community
itself
was
a
chief
landowner
the
nation
had
its
its
the
property
of
no
one
man
but
of
the
whole
state
out
of
this
by
the
common
consent
portions
might
be
cut
off
and
by
a
written
particular
men
as
their
own
the
king
might
have
his
private
estate
to
be
dealt
with
at
his
own
pleasure
but
of
the
the
land
of
the
nation
he
was
only
the
chief
administrator
bound
to
act
by
the
advice
of
his
witan
but
in
this
case
more
than
in
others
the
advice
of
the
witan
could
not
fail
to
become
formal
the
ever
growing
through
confiscations
ever
lessening
through
grants
gradually
came
to
be
looked
on
as
the
land
of
the
king
to
be
dealt
with
as
he
thought
good
we
must
not
look
for
any
change
formally
enacted
but
in
day
the
notion
of
as
the
possession
of
the
nation
and
not
of
the
king
could
have
been
only
a
survival
and
in
day
even
the
survival
passed
away
the
land
which
was
practically
the
land
of
king
edward
became
as
a
matter
of
course
the
land
of
king
william
that
land
was
now
enlarged
by
greater
confiscations
and
lessened
by
greater
grants
than
ever
for
a
moment
every
lay
estate
had
been
part
of
the
land
of
william
and
far
more
than
had
been
the
land
of
the
nation
remained
the
land
of
the
king
to
be
dealt
with
as
he
thought
good
in
the
tenure
of
land
william
seems
to
have
made
no
formal
change
but
the
circumstances
of
his
reign
gave
increased
strength
to
certain
tendencies
which
had
been
long
afloat
and
out
of
them
in
the
next
reign
the
malignant
genius
of
randolf
flambard
devised
a
systematic
code
of
oppression
yet
even
in
his
work
there
is
little
of
formal
change
there
are
no
laws
of
william
rufus
the
so
called
feudal
incidents
the
claims
of
marriage
wardship
and
the
like
on
the
part
of
the
lord
the
ancient
developed
into
the
later
all
these
things
were
in
the
germ
under
william
as
they
had
been
in
the
germ
long
before
him
in
the
hands
of
randolf
flambard
they
stiffen
into
established
custom
their
legal
acknowledgement
comes
from
the
charter
of
henry
the
first
which
promises
to
reform
their
abuses
thus
the
conqueror
clearly
claimed
the
right
to
interfere
with
the
marriages
of
his
nobles
at
any
rate
to
forbid
a
marriage
to
which
he
objected
on
grounds
of
policy
under
randolf
flambard
this
became
a
regular
claim
which
of
course
was
made
a
means
of
extorting
money
under
henry
the
claim
is
regulated
and
modified
but
by
being
regulated
and
modified
it
is
legally
established
the
ordinary
administration
of
the
kingdom
went
on
under
william
greatly
modified
by
the
circumstances
of
his
reign
but
hardly
at
all
changed
in
outward
form
like
the
kings
that
were
before
him
he
his
at
the
three
great
feasts
at
easter
at
winchester
at
pentecost
at
westminster
at
christmas
at
gloucester
like
the
kings
that
were
before
him
he
gathered
together
the
great
men
of
the
realm
and
when
need
was
the
small
men
also
nothing
seems
to
have
been
changed
in
the
constitution
or
the
powers
of
the
assembly
but
its
spirit
must
have
been
utterly
changed
the
innermost
circle
earls
bishops
great
officers
of
state
and
household
gradually
changed
from
a
body
of
englishmen
with
a
few
strangers
among
them
into
a
body
of
strangers
among
whom
two
or
three
englishmen
still
kept
their
places
the
result
of
their
with
william
was
not
likely
to
be
other
than
an
assent
to
will
the
ordinary
freeman
did
not
lose
his
abstract
right
to
come
and
shout
yea
to
any
addition
that
king
william
made
to
the
law
of
king
edward
but
there
would
be
nothing
to
tempt
him
to
come
unless
king
william
thought
fit
to
bid
him
but
once
at
least
william
did
gather
together
if
not
every
freeman
at
least
all
freeholders
of
the
smallest
account
on
one
point
the
conqueror
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
on
one
point
he
was
to
be
a
benefactor
to
his
kingdom
through
all
succeeding
ages
the
realm
of
england
was
to
be
one
and
indivisible
no
ruler
or
subject
in
the
kingdom
of
england
should
again
dream
that
that
kingdom
could
be
split
asunder
when
he
offered
harold
the
underkingship
of
the
realm
or
of
some
part
of
it
he
did
so
doubtless
only
in
the
full
conviction
that
the
offer
would
be
refused
no
such
offer
should
be
heard
of
again
there
should
be
no
such
division
as
had
been
between
cnut
and
edmund
between
harthacnut
and
the
first
harold
such
as
edwin
and
morkere
had
dreamed
of
in
later
times
nor
should
the
kingdom
be
split
asunder
in
that
subtler
way
which
william
of
all
men
best
understood
the
way
in
which
the
frankish
kingdoms
east
and
west
had
split
asunder
he
would
have
no
dukes
or
earls
who
might
become
kings
in
all
but
name
each
in
his
own
duchy
or
earldom
no
man
in
his
realm
should
be
to
him
as
he
was
to
his
overlord
at
paris
no
man
in
his
realm
should
plead
duty
towards
an
immediate
lord
as
an
excuse
for
breach
of
duty
towards
the
lord
of
that
immediate
lord
hence
policy
with
regard
to
earldoms
there
was
to
be
nothing
like
the
great
governments
which
had
been
held
by
godwine
leofric
and
siward
an
earl
of
the
or
the
northumbrians
was
too
like
a
duke
of
the
normans
to
be
endured
by
one
who
was
duke
of
the
normans
himself
the
earl
even
of
the
appointment
still
represented
the
separate
being
of
the
district
over
which
he
was
set
he
was
the
representative
rather
than
merely
his
officer
if
he
was
a
magistrate
and
not
a
prince
he
often
sat
in
the
seat
of
former
princes
and
might
easily
grow
into
a
prince
and
at
last
at
the
very
end
of
his
reign
as
the
finishing
of
his
work
he
took
the
final
step
that
made
england
for
ever
one
in
every
landowner
in
england
swore
to
be
faithful
to
king
william
within
and
without
england
and
to
defend
him
against
his
enemies
the
duty
to
the
king
was
to
any
duty
which
the
vassal
might
owe
to
any
inferior
lord
when
the
king
was
the
embodiment
of
national
unity
and
orderly
government
this
was
the
greatest
of
all
steps
in
the
direction
of
both
never
did
william
or
any
other
man
act
more
distinctly
as
an
english
statesman
never
did
any
one
act
tell
more
directly
towards
the
later
making
of
england
than
this
memorable
act
of
the
conqueror
here
indeed
is
an
addition
which
william
made
to
the
law
of
edward
for
the
truest
good
of
the
english
folk
and
yet
no
enactment
has
ever
been
more
thoroughly
misunderstood
lawyer
after
lawyer
has
set
down
in
his
book
that
at
the
assembly
of
salisbury
in
william
introduced
feudal
if
the
words
have
any
meaning
the
object
of
the
law
now
made
was
to
hinder
any
from
coming
into
england
william
would
be
king
of
a
kingdom
head
of
a
commonwealth
personal
lord
of
every
man
in
his
realm
not
merely
like
a
king
of
the
french
external
lord
of
princes
whose
subjects
owed
him
no
allegiance
this
greatest
monument
of
the
statesmanship
was
carried
into
effect
in
a
special
assembly
of
the
english
nation
gathered
on
the
first
day
of
august
on
the
great
plain
of
salisbury
now
perhaps
for
the
first
time
we
get
a
distinct
foreshadowing
of
lords
and
commons
the
witan
the
great
men
of
the
realm
and
landsitting
men
the
whole
body
of
landowners
are
now
distinguished
the
point
is
that
william
required
the
personal
presence
of
every
man
whose
personal
allegiance
he
thought
worth
having
every
man
in
the
mixed
assembly
mixed
indeed
in
race
and
speech
the
own
men
and
the
men
of
other
lords
took
the
oath
and
became
the
man
of
king
william
on
that
day
england
became
for
ever
a
kingdom
one
and
indivisible
which
since
that
day
no
man
has
dreamed
of
parting
asunder
the
great
assembly
of
will
come
again
among
the
events
of
later
reign
it
comes
here
as
the
last
act
of
that
general
settlement
which
began
in
that
settlement
besides
its
secular
side
has
also
an
ecclesiastical
side
of
a
somewhat
different
character
in
both
coming
brought
the
island
kingdom
into
a
closer
connexion
with
the
continent
and
brought
a
large
displacement
of
englishmen
and
a
large
promotion
of
strangers
but
on
the
ecclesiastical
side
though
the
changes
were
less
violent
there
was
a
more
marked
beginning
of
a
new
state
of
things
the
religious
missionary
was
more
inclined
to
innovate
than
the
military
conqueror
here
william
not
only
added
but
changed
on
one
point
he
even
proclaimed
that
the
existing
law
of
england
was
bad
certainly
the
religious
state
of
england
was
likely
to
displease
churchmen
from
the
mainland
the
english
church
so
directly
the
child
of
the
roman
was
for
that
very
reason
less
dependent
on
her
parent
she
was
a
free
colony
not
a
conquered
province
the
english
church
too
was
most
distinctly
national
no
land
came
so
near
to
that
ideal
state
of
things
in
which
the
church
is
the
nation
on
its
religious
side
papal
authority
therefore
was
weaker
in
england
than
elsewhere
and
a
less
careful
line
was
drawn
between
spiritual
and
temporal
things
and
jurisdictions
two
friendly
powers
could
take
liberties
with
each
other
the
national
assemblies
dealt
with
ecclesiastical
as
well
as
with
temporal
matters
one
indeed
among
our
ancient
laws
blames
any
assembly
that
did
otherwise
bishop
and
earl
sat
together
in
the
local
to
deal
with
many
matters
which
according
to
continental
ideas
should
have
been
dealt
with
in
separate
courts
and
by
what
in
continental
eyes
seemed
a
strange
laxity
of
discipline
priests
bishops
members
of
capitular
bodies
were
often
married
the
english
diocesan
arrangements
were
unlike
continental
models
in
gaul
by
a
tradition
of
roman
date
the
bishop
was
bishop
of
the
city
his
diocese
was
marked
by
the
extent
of
the
civil
jurisdiction
of
the
city
his
home
his
head
church
his
in
the
head
church
were
all
in
the
city
in
teutonic
england
the
bishop
was
commonly
bishop
not
of
a
city
but
of
a
tribe
or
district
his
style
was
that
of
a
tribe
his
home
his
head
church
his
bishopstool
might
be
anywhere
within
the
territory
of
that
tribe
still
on
the
greatest
point
of
all
matters
in
england
were
thoroughly
to
liking
nowhere
did
the
king
stand
forth
more
distinctly
as
the
supreme
governor
of
the
church
in
england
as
in
normandy
the
right
of
the
sovereign
to
the
investiture
of
ecclesiastical
benefices
was
ancient
and
undisputed
what
edward
had
freely
done
william
went
on
freely
doing
and
hildebrand
himself
never
ventured
on
a
word
of
remonstrance
against
a
power
which
he
deemed
so
wrongful
in
the
hands
of
his
own
sovereign
william
had
but
to
stand
on
the
rights
of
his
predecessors
when
gregory
asked
for
homage
for
the
crown
which
he
had
in
some
sort
given
william
answered
indeed
as
an
english
king
what
the
kings
before
him
had
done
for
or
paid
to
the
roman
see
that
would
he
do
and
pay
but
this
no
king
before
him
had
ever
done
nor
would
he
be
the
first
to
do
it
but
while
william
thus
maintained
the
rights
of
his
crown
he
was
willing
and
eager
to
do
all
that
seemed
needful
for
ecclesiastical
reform
and
the
general
result
of
his
reform
was
to
weaken
the
insular
independence
of
england
to
make
her
church
more
like
the
other
churches
of
the
west
and
to
increase
the
power
of
the
roman
bishop
william
had
now
a
in
his
taste
the
subtle
spirit
which
had
helped
to
win
his
kingdom
was
now
at
his
side
to
help
him
to
rule
it
within
a
few
months
after
the
taking
of
chester
lanfranc
sat
on
the
throne
of
augustine
as
soon
as
the
actual
conquest
was
over
william
began
to
give
his
mind
to
ecclesiastical
matters
it
might
look
like
sacrilege
when
he
caused
all
the
monasteries
of
england
to
be
harried
but
no
harm
was
done
to
the
monks
or
to
their
possessions
the
holy
houses
were
searched
for
the
hoards
which
the
rich
men
of
england
fearing
the
new
king
had
laid
up
in
the
monastic
treasuries
william
looked
on
these
hoards
as
part
of
the
forfeited
goods
of
rebels
and
carried
them
off
during
the
lent
of
this
done
he
sat
steadily
down
to
the
reform
of
the
english
church
he
had
three
papal
legates
to
guide
him
one
of
whom
ermenfrid
bishop
of
sitten
had
come
in
on
a
like
errand
in
the
time
of
edward
it
was
a
kind
of
solemn
confirmation
of
the
conquest
when
at
the
assembly
held
at
winchester
in
the
crown
was
placed
on
his
head
by
ermenfrid
the
work
of
deposing
english
prelates
and
appointing
foreign
successors
now
began
the
primacy
of
york
was
regularly
vacant
ealdred
had
died
as
the
danes
sailed
up
the
humber
to
assault
or
to
deliver
his
city
the
primacy
of
canterbury
was
to
be
made
vacant
by
the
deposition
of
stigand
his
canonical
position
had
always
been
doubtful
neither
harold
nor
william
had
been
crowned
by
him
yet
william
had
treated
him
hitherto
with
marked
courtesy
and
he
had
consecrated
at
least
one
norman
bishop
remigius
of
dorchester
he
was
now
deprived
both
of
the
archbishopric
and
of
the
bishopric
of
winchester
which
he
held
with
it
and
was
kept
under
restraint
for
the
rest
of
his
life
according
to
foreign
canonical
rules
the
sentence
may
pass
as
just
but
it
marked
a
stage
in
the
conquest
of
england
when
a
englishman
was
removed
from
the
highest
place
in
the
english
church
to
make
way
for
the
innermost
counsellor
of
the
conqueror
in
the
pentecostal
assembly
held
at
windsor
lanfranc
was
appointed
archbishop
his
excuses
were
overcome
by
his
old
master
herlwin
of
bec
he
came
to
england
and
on
august
he
was
consecrated
to
the
primacy
other
deprivations
and
appointments
took
place
in
these
assemblies
the
see
of
york
was
given
to
thomas
a
canon
of
bayeux
a
man
of
high
character
and
memorable
in
the
local
history
of
his
see
the
abbey
of
peterborough
was
vacant
by
the
death
of
brand
who
had
received
the
staff
from
the
uncrowned
eadgar
it
was
only
by
rich
gifts
that
he
had
turned
away
the
wrath
of
william
from
his
house
the
fenland
was
perhaps
already
stirring
and
the
abbot
of
peterborough
might
have
to
act
as
a
military
commander
in
this
case
the
prelate
appointed
a
norman
named
turold
was
accordingly
more
of
a
soldier
than
of
a
monk
from
these
assemblies
of
the
series
of
ecclesiastical
changes
goes
on
as
the
english
bishops
die
or
are
deprived
strangers
take
their
place
they
are
commonly
normans
but
walcher
who
became
bishop
of
durham
in
was
one
of
those
natives
of
lorraine
who
had
been
largely
favoured
in
day
at
the
time
of
death
wulfstan
was
the
only
englishman
who
kept
a
bishopric
even
his
deprivation
had
once
been
thought
of
the
story
takes
a
legendary
shape
but
it
throws
an
important
light
on
the
relations
of
church
and
state
in
england
in
an
assembly
held
in
the
west
minster
wulfstan
is
called
on
by
william
and
lanfranc
to
give
up
his
staff
he
refuses
he
will
give
it
back
to
him
who
gave
it
and
places
it
on
the
tomb
of
his
dead
master
edward
no
of
his
enemies
can
move
it
the
sentence
is
recalled
and
the
staff
yields
to
his
touch
edward
was
not
yet
a
canonized
saint
the
appeal
is
simply
from
the
living
and
foreign
king
to
the
dead
and
native
king
this
legend
growing
up
when
western
europe
was
torn
in
pieces
by
the
struggle
about
investitures
proves
better
than
the
most
authentic
documents
how
the
right
which
popes
denied
to
emperors
was
taken
for
granted
in
the
case
of
an
english
king
but
while
the
spoils
of
england
temporal
and
spiritual
were
thus
scattered
abroad
among
men
of
the
conquering
race
two
men
at
least
among
them
refused
all
share
in
plunder
which
they
deemed
unrighteous
one
gallant
norman
knight
gulbert
of
hugleville
followed
william
through
all
his
campaigns
but
when
english
estates
were
offered
as
his
reward
he
refused
to
share
in
unrighteous
gains
and
went
back
to
the
lands
of
his
fathers
which
he
could
hold
with
a
good
conscience
and
one
monk
wimund
of
not
only
refused
bishoprics
and
abbeys
but
rebuked
the
conqueror
for
wrong
and
robbery
and
william
bore
no
grudge
against
his
censor
but
when
the
archbishopric
of
rouen
became
vacant
he
offered
it
to
the
man
who
had
rebuked
him
among
the
worthies
of
england
gulbert
and
wimund
can
hardly
claim
a
place
but
a
place
should
surely
be
theirs
among
the
men
whom
england
honours
the
primacy
of
lanfranc
is
one
of
the
most
memorable
in
our
history
in
the
words
of
the
parable
put
forth
by
anselm
in
the
next
reign
the
plough
of
the
english
church
was
for
seventeen
years
drawn
by
two
oxen
of
equal
strength
by
ancient
english
custom
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
was
the
special
counsellor
the
special
representative
of
his
church
and
people
lanfranc
can
not
be
charged
with
any
direct
oppression
yet
in
the
hands
of
a
stranger
who
had
his
spiritual
conquest
to
make
the
tribunitian
office
of
former
archbishops
was
lost
in
that
of
chief
minister
of
the
sovereign
in
the
first
action
of
their
joint
rule
the
interest
of
king
and
primate
was
the
same
lanfranc
sought
for
a
more
distinct
acknowledgement
of
the
superiority
of
canterbury
over
the
rival
metropolis
of
york
and
this
fell
in
with
schemes
for
the
consolidation
of
the
kingdom
the
political
motive
is
avowed
northumberland
which
had
been
so
hard
to
subdue
and
which
still
lay
open
to
danish
invaders
or
deliverers
was
still
dangerous
an
independent
archbishop
of
york
might
consecrate
a
king
of
the
northumbrians
native
or
danish
who
might
grow
into
a
king
of
the
english
the
northern
metropolitan
had
unwillingly
to
admit
the
superiority
and
something
more
of
the
southern
the
caution
of
william
and
his
ecclesiastical
adviser
reckoned
it
among
possible
chances
that
even
thomas
of
bayeux
might
crown
an
invading
cnut
or
harold
in
opposition
to
his
native
sovereign
and
benefactor
for
some
of
his
own
purposes
william
had
perhaps
chosen
his
minister
too
wisely
the
objects
of
the
two
colleagues
were
not
always
the
same
lanfranc
sprung
from
imperialist
pavia
was
no
zealot
for
extravagant
papal
claims
the
caution
with
which
he
bore
himself
during
the
schism
which
followed
the
strife
between
gregory
and
henry
brought
on
him
more
than
one
papal
censure
yet
the
general
tendency
of
his
administration
was
towards
the
growth
of
ecclesiastical
and
even
of
papal
claims
william
never
dreamed
of
giving
up
his
ecclesiastical
supremacy
or
of
exempting
churchmen
from
the
ordinary
power
of
the
law
but
the
division
of
the
civil
and
ecclesiastical
jurisdiction
the
increased
frequency
of
synods
distinct
from
the
general
assemblies
of
the
though
the
acts
of
those
synods
needed
the
royal
steps
towards
that
exemption
of
churchmen
from
the
civil
power
which
was
asserted
in
one
memorable
saying
towards
the
end
of
own
reign
william
could
hold
his
own
against
hildebrand
himself
yet
the
increased
intercourse
with
rome
the
more
frequent
presence
of
roman
legates
all
tended
to
increase
the
papal
claims
and
the
deference
yielded
to
them
william
refused
homage
to
gregory
but
it
is
significant
that
gregory
asked
for
it
it
was
a
step
towards
the
day
when
a
king
of
england
was
glad
to
offer
it
the
increased
strictness
as
to
the
marriage
of
the
clergy
tended
the
same
way
lanfranc
did
not
at
once
enforce
the
full
rigour
of
decrees
marriage
was
forbidden
for
the
future
the
capitular
clergy
had
to
part
from
their
wives
but
the
vested
interest
of
the
parish
priest
was
respected
in
another
point
william
directly
helped
to
undermine
his
own
authority
and
the
independence
of
his
kingdom
he
exempted
his
abbey
of
the
battle
from
the
authority
of
the
diocesan
bishop
with
this
began
a
crowd
of
such
exemptions
which
by
weakening
local
authority
strengthened
the
power
of
the
roman
see
all
these
things
helped
on
great
scheme
which
made
the
clergy
everywhere
members
of
one
distinct
and
exclusive
body
with
the
roman
bishop
at
their
head
whatever
tended
to
part
the
clergy
from
other
men
tended
to
weaken
the
throne
of
every
king
while
william
reigned
with
lanfranc
at
his
side
these
things
were
not
felt
but
the
seed
was
sown
for
the
controversy
between
henry
and
thomas
and
for
the
humiliation
of
john
even
those
changes
of
primacy
which
seem
of
purely
ecclesiastical
concern
all
helped
in
some
way
to
increase
the
intercourse
between
england
and
the
continent
or
to
break
down
some
insular
peculiarity
and
whatever
did
this
increased
the
power
of
rome
even
the
decree
of
that
bishoprics
should
be
removed
to
the
chief
cities
of
their
dioceses
helped
to
make
england
more
like
gaul
or
italy
so
did
the
fancy
of
bishops
and
abbots
for
rebuilding
their
churches
on
a
greater
scale
and
in
the
last
devised
continental
style
all
tended
to
make
england
less
of
another
world
on
the
other
hand
one
insular
peculiarity
well
served
the
purposes
of
the
new
primate
monastic
chapters
in
episcopal
churches
were
almost
unknown
out
of
england
lanfranc
himself
a
monk
favoured
monks
in
this
matter
also
in
several
churches
the
secular
canons
were
displaced
by
monks
the
corporate
spirit
of
the
regulars
and
their
dependence
on
rome
was
far
stronger
than
that
of
the
secular
clergy
the
secular
chapters
could
be
refractory
but
the
disputes
between
them
and
their
bishops
were
mainly
of
local
importance
they
form
no
such
part
of
the
general
story
of
ecclesiastical
and
papal
advance
as
the
long
tale
of
the
quarrel
between
the
archbishops
and
the
monks
of
christ
church
lanfranc
survived
william
and
placed
the
crown
on
the
head
of
his
successor
the
friendship
between
king
and
archbishop
remained
unbroken
through
their
joint
lives
acts
were
acts
what
the
primate
did
must
have
been
approved
by
the
king
how
far
acts
were
acts
it
is
less
easy
to
say
but
the
archbishop
was
ever
a
trusted
minister
and
a
trusted
counsellor
and
in
the
frequent
absences
from
england
he
often
acted
as
his
lieutenant
we
do
not
find
him
actually
taking
a
part
in
warfare
but
he
duly
reports
military
successes
to
his
sovereign
it
was
combined
wisdom
and
good
luck
to
provide
himself
with
a
counsellor
than
whom
for
his
immediate
purposes
none
could
be
better
a
man
either
of
a
higher
or
a
lower
moral
level
than
lanfranc
a
saint
like
anselm
or
one
of
the
mere
worldly
bishops
of
the
time
would
not
have
done
his
work
so
well
william
needed
an
ecclesiastical
statesman
neither
unscrupulous
nor
and
he
found
him
in
the
lawyer
of
pavia
the
doctor
of
avranches
the
monk
of
bec
the
abbot
of
saint
if
lanfranc
sometimes
unwittingly
outwitted
both
his
master
and
himself
if
his
policy
served
the
purposes
of
rome
more
than
suited
the
purposes
of
either
that
is
the
common
course
of
human
affairs
great
men
are
apt
to
forget
that
systems
which
they
can
work
themselves
can
not
be
worked
by
smaller
men
from
this
error
neither
william
nor
lanfranc
was
free
but
from
their
own
point
of
view
it
was
their
only
error
their
work
was
to
subdue
england
soul
and
body
and
they
subdued
it
that
work
could
not
be
done
without
great
wrong
but
no
other
two
men
of
that
day
could
have
done
it
with
so
little
wrong
the
shrinking
from
needless
and
violent
change
which
is
so
strongly
characteristic
of
william
and
less
strongly
of
lanfranc
also
made
their
work
at
the
time
easier
to
be
done
in
the
course
of
ages
it
made
it
easier
to
be
undone
chapter
x
the
revolts
against
william
the
years
which
saw
the
settlement
of
england
though
not
years
of
constant
fighting
like
the
two
years
between
the
march
to
exeter
and
the
fall
of
chester
were
not
years
of
perfect
peace
william
had
to
withstand
foes
on
both
sides
of
the
sea
to
withstand
foes
in
his
own
household
to
undergo
his
first
defeat
to
receive
his
first
wound
in
personal
conflict
nothing
shook
his
firm
hold
either
on
duchy
or
kingdom
but
in
his
later
years
his
good
luck
forsook
him
and
men
did
not
fail
to
connect
this
change
in
his
future
with
a
change
in
himself
above
all
with
one
deed
of
blood
which
stands
out
as
utterly
unlike
all
his
other
recorded
acts
but
the
amount
of
warfare
which
william
had
to
go
through
in
these
later
years
was
small
compared
with
the
great
struggles
of
his
earlier
days
there
is
no
tale
to
tell
like
the
war
of
like
the
french
invasions
of
normandy
like
the
campaigns
that
won
england
one
event
only
of
the
earlier
time
is
repeated
almost
as
exactly
as
an
event
can
be
repeated
william
had
won
maine
once
he
had
now
to
win
it
again
and
less
thoroughly
as
conqueror
his
work
is
done
a
single
expedition
into
wales
is
the
only
campaign
of
this
part
of
his
life
that
led
to
any
increase
of
territory
when
william
sat
down
to
the
settlement
of
his
kingdom
after
the
fall
of
chester
he
was
in
the
strictest
sense
full
king
over
all
england
for
the
moment
the
whole
land
obeyed
him
at
no
later
moment
did
any
large
part
of
the
land
fail
to
obey
him
all
opposition
was
now
revolt
men
were
no
longer
keeping
out
an
invader
when
they
rose
they
rose
against
a
power
which
however
wrongfully
was
the
established
government
of
the
land
two
such
movements
took
place
one
was
a
real
revolt
of
englishmen
against
foreign
rule
the
other
was
a
rebellion
of
own
earls
in
their
own
interests
in
which
english
feeling
went
with
the
king
both
were
short
sharp
struggles
which
stand
out
boldly
in
the
tale
more
important
in
the
general
story
though
less
striking
in
detail
are
the
relations
of
william
to
the
other
powers
in
and
near
the
isle
of
britain
with
the
crown
of
the
kings
he
had
taken
up
their
claims
to
supremacy
over
the
whole
island
and
probably
beyond
it
and
even
without
such
claims
border
warfare
with
his
welsh
and
scottish
neighbours
could
not
be
avoided
counting
from
the
completion
of
the
real
conquest
of
england
in
there
were
in
reign
three
distinct
sources
of
disturbance
there
were
revolts
within
the
kingdom
of
england
there
was
border
warfare
in
britain
there
were
revolts
in
continental
dominions
and
we
may
add
actual
foreign
warfare
or
threats
of
foreign
warfare
affecting
william
sometimes
in
his
norman
sometimes
in
his
english
character
with
the
affairs
of
wales
william
had
little
personally
to
do
in
this
he
is
unlike
those
who
came
immediately
before
and
after
him
in
the
lives
of
harold
and
of
william
rufus
personal
warfare
against
the
welsh
forms
an
important
part
william
the
great
commonly
left
this
kind
of
work
to
the
earls
of
the
frontier
to
hugh
of
chester
roger
of
shrewsbury
and
to
his
early
friend
william
of
hereford
so
long
as
that
fierce
life
lasted
these
earls
were
ever
at
war
with
the
welsh
princes
and
they
extended
the
english
kingdom
at
their
cost
once
only
did
the
king
take
a
personal
share
in
the
work
when
he
entered
south
wales
in
we
hear
vaguely
of
his
subduing
the
land
and
founding
castles
we
see
more
distinctly
that
he
released
many
subjects
who
were
in
british
bondage
and
that
he
went
on
a
religious
pilgrimage
to
saint
this
last
journey
is
in
some
accounts
connected
with
schemes
for
the
conquest
of
ireland
and
in
one
most
remarkable
passage
of
the
english
chronicle
the
writer
for
once
speculates
as
to
what
might
have
happened
but
did
not
had
william
lived
two
years
longer
he
would
have
won
ireland
by
his
wisdom
without
weapons
and
if
william
had
won
ireland
either
by
wisdom
or
by
weapons
he
would
assuredly
have
known
better
how
to
deal
with
it
than
most
of
those
who
have
come
after
him
if
any
man
could
have
joined
together
the
lands
which
god
has
put
asunder
surely
it
was
he
this
mysterious
saying
must
have
a
reference
to
some
definite
act
or
plan
of
which
we
have
no
other
record
and
some
slight
approach
to
the
process
of
winning
ireland
without
weapons
does
appear
in
the
ecclesiastical
intercourse
between
england
and
ireland
which
now
begins
both
the
native
irish
princes
and
the
danes
of
the
east
coast
begin
to
treat
lanfranc
as
their
metropolitan
and
to
send
bishops
to
him
for
consecration
the
name
of
the
king
of
the
english
is
never
mentioned
in
the
letters
which
passed
between
the
english
primate
and
the
kings
and
bishops
of
ireland
it
may
be
that
william
was
biding
his
time
for
some
act
of
special
wisdom
but
our
speculations
can
not
go
any
further
than
those
of
the
peterborough
chronicler
revolt
within
the
kingdom
and
invasion
from
without
both
began
in
the
year
in
which
the
conquest
was
brought
to
an
end
ecclesiastical
reforms
were
interrupted
by
the
revolt
of
the
fenland
authority
had
never
been
fully
acknowledged
in
that
corner
of
england
while
he
wore
his
crown
and
held
his
councils
elsewhere
but
the
place
where
disturbances
began
the
abbey
of
peterborough
was
certainly
in
obedience
the
warfare
made
memorable
by
the
name
of
hereward
began
in
june
and
a
scottish
harrying
of
northern
england
the
second
of
five
which
are
laid
to
the
charge
of
malcolm
took
place
in
the
same
year
and
most
likely
about
the
same
time
the
english
movement
is
connected
alike
with
the
course
of
the
danish
fleet
and
with
the
appointment
of
turold
to
the
abbey
of
peterborough
william
had
bribed
the
danish
commanders
to
forsake
their
english
allies
and
he
allowed
them
to
ravage
the
coast
a
later
bribe
took
them
back
to
denmark
but
not
till
they
had
shown
themselves
in
the
waters
of
ely
the
people
largely
of
danish
descent
flocked
to
them
thinking
as
the
chronicler
says
that
they
would
win
the
whole
land
the
movement
was
doubtless
in
favour
of
the
kingship
of
swegen
but
nothing
was
done
by
danes
and
english
together
save
to
plunder
peterborough
abbey
hereward
said
to
have
been
the
nephew
of
english
predecessor
doubtless
looked
on
the
holy
place
under
a
norman
abbot
as
part
of
the
country
the
name
of
hereward
has
gathered
round
it
such
a
mass
of
fiction
old
and
new
that
it
is
hard
to
disentangle
the
few
details
of
his
real
history
his
descent
and
are
uncertain
but
he
was
assuredly
a
man
of
lincolnshire
and
assuredly
not
the
son
of
earl
leofric
for
some
unknown
cause
he
had
been
banished
in
the
days
of
edward
or
of
harold
he
now
came
back
to
lead
his
countrymen
against
william
he
was
the
soul
of
the
movement
of
which
the
abbey
of
ely
became
the
centre
the
isle
then
easily
defensible
was
the
last
english
ground
on
which
the
conqueror
was
defied
by
englishmen
fighting
for
england
the
men
of
the
fenland
were
zealous
the
monks
of
ely
were
zealous
helpers
came
in
from
other
parts
of
england
english
leaders
left
their
shelter
in
scotland
to
share
the
dangers
of
their
countrymen
even
edwin
and
morkere
at
last
plucked
up
heart
to
leave
court
and
join
the
patriotic
movement
edwin
was
pursued
he
was
betrayed
by
traitors
he
was
overtaken
and
slain
to
deep
grief
we
are
told
his
brother
reached
the
isle
and
helped
in
its
defence
william
now
felt
that
the
revolt
called
for
his
own
presence
and
his
full
energies
the
isle
was
stoutly
attacked
and
stoutly
defended
till
according
to
one
version
the
monks
betrayed
the
stronghold
to
the
king
according
to
another
morkere
was
induced
to
surrender
by
promises
of
mercy
which
william
failed
to
fulfil
in
any
case
before
the
year
was
ended
the
isle
of
ely
was
in
hands
hereward
alone
with
a
few
companions
made
their
way
out
by
sea
william
was
less
merciful
than
usual
still
no
man
was
put
to
death
some
were
mutilated
some
imprisoned
morkere
and
other
chief
men
spent
the
rest
of
their
days
in
bonds
the
temper
of
the
conqueror
had
now
fearfully
hardened
still
he
could
honour
a
valiant
enemy
those
who
resisted
to
the
last
fared
best
all
the
legends
of
later
days
speak
of
him
as
admitted
to
peace
and
favour
one
makes
him
die
quietly
another
kills
him
at
the
hands
of
norman
enemies
but
not
at
bidding
or
with
knowledge
evidence
a
little
better
suggests
that
he
bore
arms
for
his
new
sovereign
beyond
the
sea
and
an
entry
in
domesday
also
suggests
that
he
held
lands
under
count
robert
of
mortain
in
warwickshire
it
would
suit
policy
when
he
received
hereward
to
his
favour
to
make
him
exchange
lands
near
to
the
scene
of
his
exploits
for
lands
in
a
distant
shire
held
under
the
lordship
of
the
brother
meanwhile
most
likely
in
the
summer
months
of
malcolm
ravaged
cleveland
durham
and
other
districts
where
there
must
have
been
little
left
to
ravage
meanwhile
the
ætheling
edgar
and
his
sisters
with
other
english
exiles
sought
shelter
in
scotland
and
were
hospitably
received
at
the
same
time
gospatric
now
earl
in
northumberland
retaliated
by
a
harrying
of
scottish
cumberland
which
provoked
malcolm
to
greater
cruelties
it
was
said
that
there
was
no
house
in
scotland
so
poor
that
it
had
not
an
english
bondman
presently
some
of
english
guests
joined
the
defenders
of
ely
those
of
highest
birth
stayed
in
scotland
and
malcolm
after
much
striving
persuaded
margaret
the
sister
of
edgar
to
become
his
wife
her
praises
are
written
in
scottish
history
and
the
marriage
had
no
small
share
in
the
process
which
made
the
scottish
kings
and
the
lands
which
formed
their
real
kingdom
practically
english
the
sons
and
grandsons
of
margaret
sprung
of
the
kingly
house
were
far
more
english
within
their
own
realm
than
the
norman
and
angevin
kings
of
southern
england
but
within
the
english
border
men
looked
at
things
with
other
eyes
thrice
again
did
malcolm
ravage
england
two
and
twenty
years
later
he
was
slain
in
his
last
visit
of
havoc
william
meanwhile
and
his
earls
at
least
drew
to
themselves
some
measure
of
loyalty
from
the
men
of
northern
england
as
the
guardians
of
the
land
against
the
scot
for
the
present
however
invasion
was
only
avenged
by
harrying
in
cumberland
the
year
called
william
to
ely
in
the
early
part
of
his
presence
was
still
needed
on
the
mainland
in
august
he
found
leisure
for
a
march
against
scotland
he
went
as
an
english
king
to
assert
the
rights
of
the
english
crown
to
avenge
wrongs
done
to
the
english
land
and
on
such
an
errand
englishmen
followed
him
gladly
eadric
the
defender
of
herefordshire
had
made
his
peace
with
the
king
and
he
now
held
a
place
of
high
honour
in
his
army
but
if
william
met
with
any
armed
resistance
on
his
scottish
expedition
it
did
not
amount
to
a
pitched
battle
he
passed
through
lothian
into
scotland
he
crossed
forth
and
drew
near
to
tay
and
there
by
the
round
tower
of
abernethy
the
king
of
scots
swore
oaths
and
gave
hostages
and
became
the
man
of
the
king
of
the
english
william
might
now
call
himself
like
his
predecessors
and
of
the
isle
of
britain
this
was
the
highest
point
of
his
fortune
duke
of
the
normans
king
of
the
english
he
was
undisputed
lord
from
the
march
of
anjou
to
the
narrow
sea
between
caithness
and
orkney
the
exact
terms
of
the
treaty
between
royal
vassal
and
his
overlord
are
unknown
but
one
of
them
was
clearly
the
removal
of
edgar
from
scotland
before
long
he
was
on
the
continent
william
had
not
yet
learned
that
edgar
was
less
dangerous
in
britain
than
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
and
that
he
was
safest
of
all
in
own
court
homage
done
and
hostages
received
the
lord
of
all
britain
returned
to
his
immediate
kingdom
his
march
is
connected
with
many
legendary
stories
in
real
history
it
is
marked
by
the
foundation
of
the
castle
of
durham
and
by
the
confirmation
of
the
privileges
of
the
palatine
bishops
if
all
the
earls
of
england
had
been
like
the
earls
of
chester
and
all
the
bishops
like
the
bishops
of
durham
england
would
assuredly
have
split
up
like
germany
into
a
loose
federation
of
temporal
and
spiritual
princes
this
it
was
special
work
to
hinder
but
he
doubtless
saw
that
the
exceptional
privileges
of
one
or
two
favoured
lordships
standing
in
marked
contrast
to
the
rest
would
not
really
interfere
with
his
great
plan
of
union
and
william
would
hardly
have
confirmed
the
sees
of
london
or
winchester
in
the
privileges
which
he
allowed
to
the
distant
see
of
durham
he
now
also
made
a
grant
of
earldoms
the
object
of
which
is
less
clear
than
that
of
most
of
his
actions
it
is
not
easy
to
say
why
gospatric
was
deprived
of
his
earldom
his
former
acts
of
hostility
to
william
had
been
covered
by
his
pardon
and
reappointment
in
and
since
then
he
had
acted
as
a
loyal
if
perhaps
an
indiscreet
guardian
of
the
land
two
greater
earldoms
than
his
had
become
vacant
by
the
revolt
the
death
the
imprisonment
of
edwin
and
morkere
but
these
william
had
no
intention
of
filling
he
would
not
have
in
his
realm
anything
so
dangerous
as
an
earl
of
the
or
the
northumbrians
in
the
old
sense
whether
english
or
norman
but
the
defence
of
the
northern
frontier
needed
an
earl
to
rule
northumberland
in
the
later
sense
the
land
north
of
the
tyne
and
after
the
fate
of
robert
of
comines
william
could
not
as
yet
put
a
norman
earl
in
so
perilous
a
post
but
the
englishman
whom
he
chose
was
open
to
the
same
charges
as
the
deposed
gospatric
for
he
was
waltheof
the
son
of
siward
the
hero
of
the
storm
of
york
in
already
earl
of
northampton
and
huntingdon
he
was
at
this
time
high
in
the
personal
favour
perhaps
already
the
husband
of
the
niece
one
side
of
policy
comes
out
here
union
was
sometimes
helped
by
division
there
were
men
whom
william
loved
to
make
great
but
whom
he
had
no
mind
to
make
dangerous
he
gave
them
vast
estates
but
estates
for
the
most
part
scattered
over
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
it
was
only
in
the
border
earldoms
and
in
cornwall
that
he
allowed
anything
at
all
near
to
the
lordship
of
a
whole
shire
to
be
put
in
the
hands
of
a
single
man
one
norman
and
one
englishman
held
two
earldoms
together
but
they
were
earldoms
far
apart
roger
of
montgomery
held
the
earldoms
of
shrewsbury
and
sussex
and
waltheof
to
his
midland
earldom
of
northampton
and
huntingdon
now
added
the
rule
of
distant
northumberland
the
men
who
had
fought
most
stoutly
against
william
were
the
men
whom
he
most
willingly
received
to
favour
eadric
and
hereward
were
honoured
waltheof
was
honoured
more
highly
he
ranked
along
with
the
greatest
normans
his
position
was
perhaps
higher
than
any
but
the
born
kinsmen
but
the
whole
tale
of
waltheof
is
a
problem
that
touches
the
character
of
the
king
under
whom
he
rose
and
fell
lifted
up
higher
than
any
other
man
among
the
conquered
he
was
the
one
man
whom
william
put
to
death
on
a
political
charge
it
is
hard
to
see
the
reasons
for
either
his
rise
or
his
fall
it
was
doubtless
mainly
his
end
which
won
him
the
abiding
reverence
of
his
countrymen
his
valour
and
his
piety
are
loudly
praised
but
his
valour
we
know
only
from
his
one
personal
exploit
at
york
his
piety
was
consistent
with
a
base
murder
in
other
matters
he
seems
amiable
irresolute
and
of
a
scrupulous
conscience
and
northumbrian
morality
perhaps
saw
no
great
crime
in
a
murder
committed
under
the
traditions
of
a
northumbrian
deadly
feud
long
before
waltheof
was
born
his
grandfather
earl
ealdred
had
been
killed
by
a
certain
carl
the
sons
of
carl
had
fought
by
his
side
at
york
but
notwithstanding
this
comradeship
the
first
act
of
rule
in
northumberland
was
to
send
men
to
slay
them
beyond
the
bounds
of
his
earldom
a
crime
that
was
perhaps
admired
in
northumberland
and
unheard
of
elsewhere
did
not
lose
him
either
the
favour
of
the
king
or
the
friendship
of
his
neighbour
bishop
walcher
a
reforming
prelate
with
whom
waltheof
acted
in
concert
and
when
he
was
chosen
as
the
single
exception
to
merciful
rule
it
was
not
for
this
undoubted
crime
but
on
charges
of
which
even
if
guilty
he
might
well
have
been
forgiven
the
sojourn
of
william
on
the
continent
in
carries
us
out
of
england
and
normandy
into
the
general
affairs
of
europe
signs
may
have
already
showed
themselves
of
what
was
coming
to
the
south
of
normandy
but
the
interest
of
the
moment
lay
in
the
country
of
matilda
flanders
long
the
firm
ally
of
normandy
was
now
to
change
into
a
bitter
enemy
count
baldwin
died
in
his
successor
of
the
same
name
died
three
years
later
and
a
war
followed
between
his
widow
richildis
the
guardian
of
his
young
son
arnulf
and
his
brother
robert
the
frisian
robert
had
won
fame
in
the
east
he
had
received
the
sovereignty
of
name
which
takes
in
holland
and
he
was
now
invited
to
deliver
flanders
from
the
oppressions
of
richildis
meanwhile
matilda
was
acting
as
regent
of
normandy
with
earl
william
of
hereford
as
her
counsellor
richildis
sought
help
of
her
two
overlords
king
henry
of
germany
and
king
philip
of
france
philip
came
in
person
the
german
succours
were
too
late
from
normandy
came
earl
william
with
a
small
party
of
knights
the
kings
had
been
asked
for
armies
to
the
earl
she
offered
herself
and
he
came
to
fight
for
his
bride
but
early
in
philip
arnulf
and
william
were
all
overthrown
by
robert
the
frisian
in
the
battle
of
cassel
arnulf
and
earl
william
were
killed
philip
made
peace
with
robert
henceforth
undisputed
count
of
flanders
all
this
brought
king
william
to
the
continent
while
the
invasion
of
malcolm
was
still
unavenged
no
open
war
followed
between
normandy
and
flanders
but
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
robert
and
william
were
enemies
and
each
helped
the
enemies
of
the
other
william
gave
his
support
to
baldwin
brother
of
the
slain
arnulf
who
strove
to
win
flanders
from
robert
but
the
real
interest
of
this
episode
lies
in
the
impression
which
was
made
in
the
lands
east
of
flanders
in
the
troubled
state
of
germany
when
henry
the
fourth
was
striving
with
the
saxons
both
sides
seem
to
have
looked
to
the
conqueror
of
england
with
hope
and
with
fear
on
this
matter
our
english
and
norman
authorities
are
silent
and
the
notices
in
the
contemporary
german
writers
are
strangely
unlike
one
another
but
they
show
at
least
that
the
prince
who
ruled
on
both
sides
of
the
sea
was
largely
in
thoughts
the
saxon
enemy
of
henry
describes
him
in
his
despair
as
seeking
help
in
denmark
france
aquitaine
and
also
of
the
king
of
the
english
promising
him
the
like
help
if
he
should
ever
need
it
william
and
henry
had
both
to
guard
against
saxon
enmity
but
the
throne
at
winchester
stood
firmer
than
the
throne
at
goslar
but
the
historian
of
the
continental
saxons
puts
into
mouth
an
answer
utterly
unsuited
to
his
position
he
is
made
when
in
normandy
to
answer
that
having
won
his
kingdom
by
force
he
fears
to
leave
it
lest
he
might
not
find
his
way
back
again
far
more
striking
is
the
story
told
three
years
later
by
lambert
of
herzfeld
henry
when
engaged
in
an
hungarian
war
heard
that
the
famous
archbishop
hanno
of
köln
had
leagued
with
william
is
his
earliest
surname
of
the
english
and
that
a
vast
army
was
coming
to
set
the
island
monarch
on
the
german
throne
the
host
never
came
but
henry
hastened
back
to
guard
his
frontier
against
by
that
phrase
a
teutonic
writer
can
hardly
mean
the
insular
part
of
subjects
now
assuredly
william
never
cherished
as
his
successor
probably
did
so
wild
a
dream
as
that
of
a
kingly
crowning
at
aachen
to
be
followed
perhaps
by
an
imperial
crowning
at
rome
but
that
such
schemes
were
looked
on
as
a
practical
danger
against
which
the
actual
german
king
had
to
guard
at
least
shows
the
place
which
the
conqueror
of
england
held
in
european
imagination
for
the
three
or
four
years
immediately
following
the
surrender
of
ely
journeys
to
and
fro
between
his
kingdom
and
his
duchy
were
specially
frequent
matilda
seems
to
have
always
stayed
in
normandy
she
is
never
mentioned
in
england
after
the
year
of
her
coronation
and
the
birth
of
her
youngest
son
and
she
commonly
acted
as
regent
of
the
duchy
in
the
course
of
we
see
william
in
england
in
normandy
again
in
england
and
in
scotland
in
he
was
called
beyond
sea
by
a
formidable
movement
his
great
continental
conquest
had
risen
against
him
le
mans
and
all
maine
were
again
independent
city
and
land
chose
for
them
a
prince
who
came
by
female
descent
from
the
stock
of
their
ancient
counts
this
was
hugh
the
son
of
azo
marquess
of
liguria
and
of
gersendis
the
sister
of
the
last
count
herbert
the
normans
were
driven
out
of
le
mans
azo
came
to
take
possession
in
the
name
of
his
son
but
he
and
the
citizens
did
not
long
agree
he
went
back
leaving
his
wife
and
son
under
the
guardianship
of
geoffrey
of
mayenne
presently
the
men
of
le
mans
threw
off
princely
rule
altogether
and
proclaimed
the
earliest
in
northern
gaul
here
then
as
at
exeter
william
had
to
strive
against
an
armed
commonwealth
and
as
at
exeter
we
specially
wish
to
know
what
were
to
be
the
relations
between
the
capital
and
the
county
at
large
the
mass
of
the
people
throughout
maine
threw
themselves
zealously
into
the
cause
of
the
commonwealth
but
their
zeal
might
not
have
lasted
long
if
according
to
the
usual
run
of
things
in
such
cases
they
had
simply
exchanged
the
lordship
of
their
hereditary
masters
for
the
corporate
lordship
of
the
citizens
of
le
mans
to
the
nobles
the
change
was
naturally
distasteful
they
had
to
swear
to
the
but
many
of
them
geoffrey
for
one
had
no
thought
of
keeping
their
oaths
dissensions
arose
hugh
went
back
to
italy
geoffrey
occupied
the
castle
of
le
mans
and
the
citizens
dislodged
him
only
by
the
dangerous
help
of
the
other
prince
who
claimed
the
overlordship
of
maine
count
fulk
of
anjou
if
maine
was
to
have
a
master
from
outside
the
lord
of
anjou
hardly
promised
better
than
the
lord
of
normandy
but
men
in
despair
grasp
at
anything
the
strange
thing
is
that
fulk
disappears
now
from
the
story
william
steps
in
instead
and
it
was
at
least
as
much
in
his
english
as
in
his
norman
character
that
the
duke
and
king
won
back
the
revolted
land
a
place
in
his
army
was
held
by
english
warriors
seemingly
under
the
command
of
hereward
himself
men
who
had
fought
for
freedom
in
their
own
land
now
fought
at
the
bidding
of
their
conqueror
to
put
down
freedom
in
another
land
they
went
willingly
the
english
chronicler
describes
the
campaign
with
glee
and
breaks
into
incorporates
a
contemporary
the
tale
of
english
victory
few
men
of
that
day
would
see
that
the
cause
of
maine
was
in
truth
the
cause
of
england
if
york
and
exeter
could
not
act
in
concert
with
one
another
still
less
could
either
act
in
concert
with
le
mans
englishmen
serving
in
maine
would
fancy
that
they
were
avenging
their
own
wrongs
by
laying
waste
the
lands
of
any
man
who
spoke
the
french
tongue
on
part
the
employment
of
englishmen
the
employment
of
hereward
was
another
stroke
of
policy
it
was
more
fully
following
out
the
system
which
led
englishmen
against
exeter
which
led
eadric
and
his
comrades
into
scotland
for
in
every
english
soldier
whom
william
carried
into
maine
he
won
a
loyal
english
subject
to
men
who
had
fought
under
his
banners
beyond
the
sea
he
would
be
no
longer
the
conqueror
but
the
victorious
captain
they
would
need
some
very
special
oppression
at
home
to
make
them
revolt
against
the
chief
whose
laurels
they
had
helped
to
win
as
our
own
gleeman
tells
the
tale
they
did
little
beyond
harrying
the
helpless
land
but
in
continental
writers
we
can
trace
a
regular
campaign
in
which
we
hear
of
no
battles
but
of
many
sieges
william
as
before
subdued
the
land
piecemeal
keeping
the
city
for
the
last
when
he
drew
near
to
le
mans
its
defenders
surrendered
at
his
summons
to
escape
fire
and
slaughter
by
speedy
submission
the
new
was
abolished
but
the
conqueror
swore
to
observe
all
the
ancient
rights
of
the
city
all
this
time
we
have
heard
nothing
of
count
fulk
presently
we
find
him
warring
against
nobles
of
maine
who
had
taken
part
and
leaguing
with
the
bretons
against
william
himself
the
king
set
forth
with
his
whole
force
norman
and
english
but
peace
was
made
by
the
mediation
of
an
unnamed
roman
cardinal
abetted
we
are
told
by
the
chief
norman
nobles
success
against
confederated
anjou
and
britanny
might
be
doubtful
with
maine
and
england
wavering
in
their
allegiance
and
france
scotland
and
flanders
possible
enemies
in
the
distance
the
rights
of
the
count
of
anjou
over
maine
were
formally
acknowledged
and
eldest
son
robert
did
homage
to
fulk
for
the
county
each
prince
stipulated
for
the
safety
and
favour
of
all
subjects
of
the
other
who
had
taken
his
side
between
normandy
and
anjou
there
was
peace
during
the
rest
of
the
days
of
william
in
maine
we
shall
see
yet
another
revolt
though
only
a
partial
one
william
went
back
to
england
in
in
he
went
to
the
continent
for
a
longer
absence
as
the
time
just
after
the
first
completion
of
the
conquest
is
spoken
of
as
a
time
when
normans
and
english
were
beginning
to
sit
down
side
by
side
in
peace
so
the
years
which
followed
the
submission
of
ely
are
spoken
of
as
a
time
of
special
oppression
this
fact
is
not
unconnected
with
the
frequent
absences
from
england
whatever
we
say
of
own
position
he
was
a
check
on
smaller
oppressors
things
were
always
worse
when
the
eye
of
the
great
master
was
no
longer
watching
one
weakness
was
that
of
putting
overmuch
trust
in
his
immediate
kinsfolk
and
friends
of
the
two
special
oppressors
william
had
thrown
away
his
life
in
flanders
but
bishop
ode
was
still
at
work
till
several
years
later
his
king
and
brother
struck
him
down
with
a
truly
righteous
blow
the
year
not
a
year
of
fighting
was
a
year
of
intrigue
enemies
on
the
continent
strove
to
turn
the
representative
of
the
kings
to
help
their
ends
edgar
flits
to
and
fro
between
scotland
and
flanders
and
the
king
of
the
french
tempts
him
with
the
offer
of
a
convenient
settlement
on
the
march
of
france
normandy
and
flanders
edgar
sets
forth
from
scotland
but
is
driven
back
by
a
storm
malcolm
and
margaret
then
change
their
minds
and
bid
him
make
his
peace
with
king
william
william
gladly
accepts
his
submission
an
embassy
is
sent
to
bring
him
with
all
worship
to
the
king
in
normandy
he
abides
for
several
years
in
court
contented
and
despised
receiving
a
daily
pension
and
the
profits
of
estates
in
england
of
no
great
extent
which
the
king
of
a
moment
held
by
the
grant
of
a
rival
who
could
afford
to
be
magnanimous
showed
that
he
belonged
to
that
class
of
men
who
as
a
rule
slothful
and
listless
can
yet
on
occasion
act
with
energy
and
who
act
most
creditably
on
behalf
of
others
but
william
had
no
need
to
fear
him
and
he
was
easily
turned
into
a
friend
and
a
dependant
edgar
first
of
englishmen
by
descent
was
hardly
an
englishman
by
birth
william
had
now
to
deal
with
the
englishman
who
stood
next
to
edgar
in
dignity
and
far
above
him
in
personal
estimation
we
have
reached
the
great
in
reign
and
character
the
black
and
mysterious
tale
of
the
fate
of
waltheof
the
earl
of
northumberland
northampton
and
huntingdon
was
not
the
only
earl
in
england
of
english
birth
the
earldom
of
the
was
held
by
a
born
englishman
who
was
more
hateful
than
any
stranger
ralph
of
wader
was
the
one
englishman
who
had
fought
at
side
against
england
he
often
passes
for
a
native
of
britanny
and
he
certainly
held
lands
and
castles
in
that
country
but
he
was
breton
only
by
the
side
for
domesday
and
the
chronicles
show
that
he
was
the
son
of
an
elder
earl
ralph
who
had
been
or
master
of
the
horse
in
days
and
who
is
expressly
said
to
have
been
born
in
norfolk
the
unusual
name
suggests
that
the
elder
ralph
was
not
of
english
descent
he
survived
the
coming
of
william
and
his
son
fought
on
senlac
among
the
countrymen
of
his
mother
this
treason
implies
an
unrecorded
banishment
in
the
days
of
edward
or
harold
already
earl
in
he
had
in
that
year
acted
vigorously
for
william
against
the
danes
but
he
now
conspired
against
him
along
with
roger
the
younger
son
of
william
who
had
succeeded
his
father
in
the
earldom
of
hereford
while
his
norman
estates
had
passed
to
his
elder
brother
william
what
grounds
of
complaint
either
ralph
or
roger
had
against
william
we
know
not
but
that
the
loyalty
of
the
earl
of
hereford
was
doubtful
throughout
the
year
appears
from
several
letters
of
rebuke
and
counsel
sent
to
him
by
the
regent
lanfranc
at
last
the
wielder
of
both
swords
took
to
his
spiritual
arms
and
pronounced
the
earl
excommunicate
till
he
should
submit
to
the
mercy
and
make
restitution
to
the
king
and
to
all
men
whom
he
had
wronged
roger
remained
under
the
censure
and
presently
committed
an
act
of
direct
disobedience
the
next
year
he
gave
his
sister
emma
in
marriage
to
earl
ralph
this
marriage
the
king
had
forbidden
on
some
unrecorded
ground
of
state
policy
most
likely
he
already
suspected
both
earls
and
thought
any
tie
between
them
dangerous
the
notice
shows
william
stepping
in
to
do
as
an
act
of
policy
what
under
his
successors
became
a
matter
of
course
done
with
the
sole
object
of
making
money
the
name
that
lurks
in
the
modern
shape
of
held
at
exning
in
cambridgeshire
bishops
and
abbots
were
guests
of
the
excommunicated
roger
waltheof
was
there
and
many
breton
comrades
of
ralph
in
their
cups
they
began
to
plot
how
they
might
drive
the
king
out
of
the
kingdom
charges
both
true
and
false
were
brought
against
william
in
a
mixed
gathering
of
normans
english
and
bretons
almost
every
act
of
life
might
pass
as
a
wrong
done
to
some
part
of
the
company
even
though
some
others
of
the
company
were
his
accomplices
above
all
the
two
earls
ralph
and
roger
made
a
distinct
proposal
to
their
waltheof
king
william
should
be
driven
out
of
the
land
one
of
the
three
should
be
king
the
other
two
should
remain
earls
ruling
each
over
a
third
of
the
kingdom
such
a
scheme
might
attract
earls
but
no
one
else
it
would
undo
best
and
greatest
work
it
would
throw
back
the
growing
unity
of
the
kingdom
by
all
the
steps
that
it
had
taken
during
several
generations
now
what
amount
of
favour
did
waltheof
give
to
these
schemes
weighing
the
accounts
it
would
seem
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
he
consented
to
the
treason
but
that
he
thought
better
of
it
the
next
morning
he
went
to
lanfranc
at
once
regent
and
ghostly
father
and
confessed
to
him
whatever
he
had
to
confess
the
primate
assigned
his
penitent
some
ecclesiastical
penances
the
regent
bade
the
earl
go
into
normandy
and
tell
the
whole
tale
to
the
king
waltheof
went
with
gifts
in
hand
he
told
his
story
and
craved
forgiveness
william
made
light
of
the
matter
and
kept
waltheof
with
him
but
seemingly
not
under
restraint
till
he
came
back
to
england
meanwhile
the
other
two
earls
were
in
open
rebellion
ralph
half
breton
by
birth
and
earl
of
a
danish
land
asked
help
in
britanny
and
denmark
bretons
from
britanny
and
bretons
settled
in
england
flocked
to
him
king
swegen
now
almost
at
the
end
of
his
reign
and
life
listened
to
the
call
of
the
rebels
and
sent
a
fleet
under
the
command
of
his
son
cnut
the
future
saint
together
with
an
earl
named
hakon
the
revolt
in
england
was
soon
put
down
both
in
east
and
west
the
rebel
earls
met
with
no
support
save
from
those
who
were
under
their
immediate
influence
the
country
acted
zealously
for
the
king
lanfranc
could
report
that
earl
ralph
and
his
army
were
fleeing
and
that
the
men
french
and
english
were
chasing
them
in
another
letter
he
could
add
with
some
strength
of
language
that
the
kingdom
was
cleansed
from
the
filth
of
the
bretons
at
norwich
only
the
castle
was
valiantly
defended
by
the
newly
married
countess
emma
roger
was
taken
prisoner
ralph
fled
to
britanny
their
followers
were
punished
with
various
mutilations
save
the
defenders
of
norwich
who
were
admitted
to
terms
the
countess
joined
her
husband
in
britanny
and
in
days
to
come
ralph
did
something
to
redeem
so
many
treasons
by
dying
as
an
armed
pilgrim
in
the
first
crusade
the
main
point
of
this
story
is
that
the
revolt
met
with
no
english
support
whatever
not
only
did
bishop
wulfstan
march
along
with
his
fierce
norman
brethren
ode
and
geoffrey
the
english
people
everywhere
were
against
the
rebels
for
this
revolt
offered
no
attraction
to
english
feeling
had
the
undertaking
been
less
hopeless
nothing
could
have
been
gained
by
exchanging
the
rule
of
william
for
that
of
ralph
or
roger
it
might
have
been
different
if
the
danes
had
played
their
part
better
the
rebellion
broke
out
while
william
was
in
normandy
it
was
the
sailing
of
the
danish
fleet
which
brought
him
back
to
england
but
never
did
enterprise
bring
less
honour
on
its
leaders
than
this
last
danish
voyage
up
the
humber
all
that
the
holy
cnut
did
was
to
plunder
the
minster
of
saint
peter
at
york
and
to
sail
away
his
coming
however
seems
to
have
altogether
changed
the
feelings
with
regard
to
waltheof
as
yet
he
had
not
been
dealt
with
as
a
prisoner
or
an
enemy
he
now
came
back
to
england
with
the
king
and
first
act
was
to
imprison
both
waltheof
and
roger
the
imprisonment
of
roger
a
rebel
taken
in
arms
was
a
matter
of
course
as
for
waltheof
whatever
he
had
promised
at
the
he
had
done
no
disloyal
act
he
had
had
no
share
in
the
rebellion
and
he
had
told
the
king
all
that
he
knew
but
he
had
listened
to
traitors
and
it
might
be
dangerous
to
leave
him
at
large
when
a
danish
fleet
led
by
his
old
comrade
cnut
was
actually
afloat
still
what
followed
is
strange
indeed
specially
strange
with
william
as
its
chief
doer
at
the
midwinter
gemót
of
roger
and
waltheof
were
brought
to
trial
ralph
was
condemned
in
absence
like
eustace
of
boulogne
roger
was
sentenced
to
forfeiture
and
imprisonment
for
life
waltheof
made
his
defence
his
sentence
was
deferred
he
was
kept
at
winchester
in
a
straiter
imprisonment
than
before
at
the
pentecostal
gemót
of
held
at
westminster
his
case
was
again
argued
and
he
was
sentenced
to
death
on
the
last
day
of
may
the
last
english
earl
was
beheaded
on
the
hills
above
winchester
such
a
sentence
and
execution
strange
at
any
time
is
specially
strange
under
william
whatever
waltheof
had
done
his
offence
was
lighter
than
that
of
roger
yet
waltheof
has
the
heavier
and
roger
the
lighter
punishment
with
scroggs
or
jeffreys
on
the
bench
it
might
have
been
argued
that
confession
to
the
king
did
not
in
strictness
of
law
wipe
out
the
guilt
of
his
original
promise
to
the
conspirators
but
william
the
great
did
not
commonly
act
after
the
fashion
of
scroggs
and
jeffreys
to
deprive
waltheof
of
his
earldom
might
doubtless
be
prudent
a
man
who
had
even
listened
to
traitors
might
be
deemed
unfit
for
such
a
trust
it
might
be
wise
to
keep
him
safe
under
the
eye
like
edwin
morkere
and
edgar
but
why
should
he
be
picked
out
for
death
when
the
far
more
guilty
roger
was
allowed
to
live
why
should
he
be
chosen
as
the
one
victim
of
a
prince
who
never
before
or
after
in
normandy
or
in
england
doomed
any
man
to
die
on
a
political
charge
these
are
questions
hard
to
answer
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
waltheof
was
an
englishman
that
it
was
policy
gradually
to
get
rid
of
englishmen
in
high
places
and
that
the
time
was
now
come
to
get
rid
of
the
last
for
such
a
policy
forfeiture
or
at
most
imprisonment
would
have
been
enough
while
other
englishmen
lost
lands
honours
at
most
liberty
waltheof
alone
lost
his
life
by
a
judicial
sentence
it
is
likely
enough
that
many
normans
hungered
for
the
lands
and
honours
of
the
one
englishman
who
still
held
the
highest
rank
in
england
still
forfeiture
without
death
might
have
satisfied
even
them
but
waltheof
was
not
only
earl
of
three
shires
he
was
husband
of
the
near
kinswoman
we
are
told
that
judith
was
the
enemy
and
accuser
of
her
husband
this
may
have
touched
one
weak
point
yet
he
would
hardly
have
swerved
from
the
practice
of
his
whole
life
to
please
the
bloody
caprice
of
a
niece
who
longed
for
the
death
of
her
husband
and
if
judith
longed
for
death
it
was
not
from
a
wish
to
supply
his
place
with
another
legend
says
that
she
refused
a
second
husband
offered
her
by
the
king
it
is
certain
that
she
remained
a
widow
death
must
thus
remain
a
mystery
an
isolated
deed
of
blood
unlike
anything
else
in
life
it
seems
to
have
been
impolitic
it
led
to
no
revolt
but
it
called
forth
a
new
burst
of
english
feeling
waltheof
was
deemed
the
martyr
of
his
people
he
received
the
same
popular
canonization
as
more
than
one
english
patriot
signs
and
wonders
were
wrought
at
his
tomb
at
crowland
till
displays
of
miraculous
power
which
were
so
inconsistent
with
loyalty
and
good
order
were
straitly
forbidden
the
act
itself
marks
a
stage
in
the
downward
course
of
character
in
itself
the
harrying
of
northumberland
the
very
invasion
of
england
with
all
the
bloodshed
that
they
caused
might
be
deemed
blacker
crimes
than
the
unjust
death
of
a
single
man
but
as
human
nature
stands
the
less
crime
needs
a
worse
man
to
do
it
crime
as
ever
led
to
further
crime
and
was
itself
the
punishment
of
crime
in
the
eyes
of
contemporaries
the
death
of
waltheof
the
blackest
act
of
life
was
also
its
from
the
day
of
the
martyrdom
on
saint
hill
the
magic
of
name
and
arms
passed
away
unfailing
luck
no
longer
waited
on
him
after
death
he
never
till
his
last
campaign
of
all
won
a
battle
or
took
a
town
in
this
change
of
fortunes
the
men
of
his
own
day
saw
the
judgement
of
god
upon
his
crime
and
in
the
fact
at
least
they
were
undoubtedly
right
henceforth
though
real
power
abides
unshaken
the
tale
of
his
warfare
is
chiefly
a
tale
of
petty
defeats
the
last
eleven
years
of
his
life
would
never
have
won
him
the
name
of
conqueror
but
in
the
higher
walk
of
policy
and
legislation
never
was
his
nobler
surname
more
truly
deserved
never
did
william
the
great
show
himself
so
truly
great
as
in
these
later
years
the
death
of
waltheof
and
the
popular
judgement
on
it
suggest
another
act
of
which
can
not
have
been
far
from
it
in
point
of
time
and
about
which
men
spoke
in
his
own
day
in
the
same
spirit
if
the
judgement
of
god
came
on
william
for
the
beheading
of
waltheof
it
came
on
him
also
for
the
making
of
the
new
forest
as
to
that
forest
there
is
a
good
deal
of
ancient
exaggeration
and
a
good
deal
of
modern
misconception
the
word
is
often
misunderstood
in
its
older
meaning
a
meaning
which
it
still
keeps
in
some
parts
a
forest
has
nothing
to
do
with
trees
it
is
a
tract
of
land
put
outside
the
common
law
and
subject
to
a
stricter
law
of
its
own
and
that
commonly
probably
always
to
secure
for
the
king
the
freer
enjoyment
of
the
pleasure
of
hunting
such
a
forest
william
made
in
hampshire
the
impression
which
it
made
on
minds
at
the
time
is
shown
by
its
having
kept
the
name
of
the
new
forest
for
eight
hundred
years
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
william
laid
waste
any
large
tract
of
specially
fruitful
country
least
of
all
that
he
laid
waste
a
land
thickly
inhabited
for
most
of
the
forest
land
never
can
have
been
such
but
it
is
certain
from
domesday
and
the
chronicle
that
william
did
a
considerable
tract
of
land
in
hampshire
he
set
it
apart
for
the
purposes
of
hunting
he
fenced
it
in
by
special
and
cruel
indeed
short
of
the
protection
of
his
pleasures
and
in
this
process
some
men
lost
their
lands
and
were
driven
from
their
homes
some
destruction
of
houses
is
here
implied
some
destruction
of
churches
is
not
unlikely
the
popular
belief
which
hardly
differs
from
the
account
of
writers
one
degree
later
than
domesday
and
the
chronicle
simply
exaggerates
the
extent
of
destruction
there
was
no
such
laying
waste
as
is
often
supposed
because
no
such
laying
waste
was
needed
but
whatever
was
needed
for
purpose
was
done
and
domesday
gives
us
the
record
and
the
act
surely
makes
like
the
death
of
waltheof
a
downward
stage
in
character
the
harrying
of
northumberland
was
in
itself
a
far
greater
crime
and
involved
far
more
of
human
wretchedness
but
it
is
not
remembered
in
the
same
way
because
it
has
left
no
such
abiding
memorial
but
here
again
the
lesser
crime
needed
a
worse
man
to
do
it
the
harrying
of
northumberland
was
a
crime
done
with
a
political
object
it
was
the
extreme
form
of
military
severity
it
was
not
vulgar
robbery
done
with
no
higher
motive
than
to
secure
the
fuller
enjoyment
of
a
brutal
sport
to
this
level
william
had
now
sunk
it
was
in
truth
now
that
hunting
in
england
finally
took
the
character
of
a
mere
sport
hunting
was
no
new
thing
in
an
early
state
of
society
it
is
often
a
necessary
thing
the
hunting
of
alfred
is
spoken
of
as
a
grave
matter
of
business
as
part
of
his
kingly
duty
he
had
to
make
war
on
the
wild
beasts
as
he
had
to
make
war
on
the
danes
the
hunting
of
william
is
simply
a
sport
not
his
duty
or
his
business
but
merely
his
pleasure
and
to
this
pleasure
the
pleasure
of
inflicting
pain
and
slaughter
he
did
not
scruple
to
sacrifice
the
rights
of
other
men
and
to
guard
his
enjoyment
by
ruthless
laws
at
which
even
in
that
rough
age
men
shuddered
for
this
crime
the
men
of
his
day
saw
the
punishment
in
the
strange
and
frightful
deaths
of
his
offspring
two
sons
and
a
grandson
on
the
scene
of
his
crime
one
of
these
himself
he
saw
the
death
of
his
second
son
richard
a
youth
of
great
promise
whose
prolonged
life
might
have
saved
england
from
the
rule
of
william
rufus
he
died
in
the
forest
about
the
year
to
the
deep
grief
of
his
parents
and
domesday
contains
a
touching
entry
how
william
gave
back
his
land
to
a
despoiled
englishman
as
an
offering
for
soul
the
forfeiture
of
three
earls
the
death
of
one
threw
their
honours
and
estates
into
the
hands
another
fresh
source
of
wealth
came
by
the
death
of
the
lady
edith
who
had
kept
her
royal
rank
and
her
great
estates
and
who
died
while
the
proceedings
against
waltheof
were
going
on
it
was
not
now
so
important
for
william
as
it
had
been
in
the
first
years
of
the
conquest
to
reward
his
followers
he
could
now
think
of
the
royal
hoard
in
the
first
place
of
the
estates
which
now
fell
in
to
the
crown
large
parts
were
granted
out
the
house
of
bigod
afterwards
so
renowned
as
earls
of
norfolk
owe
their
rise
to
their
share
in
the
forfeited
lands
of
earl
ralph
but
william
kept
the
greater
part
to
himself
one
lordship
in
somerset
part
of
the
lands
of
the
lady
he
gave
to
the
church
of
saint
peter
at
rome
of
the
three
earldoms
those
of
hereford
and
were
not
filled
up
the
later
earldoms
of
those
lands
have
no
connexion
with
the
earls
of
day
southern
earldoms
of
northampton
and
huntingdon
became
the
dowry
of
his
daughter
matilda
that
of
huntingdon
passed
to
his
descendants
the
kings
of
scots
but
northumberland
close
on
the
scottish
border
still
needed
an
earl
but
there
is
something
strange
in
the
choice
of
bishop
walcher
of
durham
it
is
possible
that
this
appointment
was
a
concession
to
english
feeling
stirred
to
wrath
at
the
death
of
waltheof
the
days
of
english
earls
were
over
and
a
norman
would
have
been
looked
on
as
murderer
the
lotharingian
bishop
was
a
stranger
but
he
was
not
a
norman
and
he
was
no
oppressor
of
englishmen
but
he
was
strangely
unfit
for
the
place
not
a
fighting
bishop
like
ode
and
geoffrey
he
was
chiefly
devoted
to
spiritual
affairs
specially
to
the
revival
of
the
monastic
life
which
had
died
out
in
northern
england
since
the
danish
invasions
but
his
weak
trust
in
unworthy
favourites
english
and
foreign
led
him
to
a
fearful
and
memorable
end
the
bishop
was
on
terms
of
close
friendship
with
ligulf
an
englishman
of
the
highest
birth
and
uncle
by
marriage
to
earl
waltheof
he
had
kept
his
estates
but
the
insolence
of
his
norman
neighbours
had
caused
him
to
come
and
live
in
the
city
of
durham
near
his
friend
the
bishop
his
favour
with
walcher
roused
the
envy
of
some
of
the
favourites
who
presently
contrived
his
death
the
bishop
lamented
and
rebuked
them
but
he
failed
to
justice
to
punish
the
offenders
sternly
and
speedily
he
was
therefore
believed
to
be
himself
guilty
of
death
one
of
the
most
striking
and
instructive
events
of
the
time
followed
on
may
a
full
gemót
of
the
earldom
was
held
at
gateshead
to
deal
with
the
murder
of
ligulf
this
was
one
of
those
rare
occasions
when
a
strong
feeling
led
every
man
to
the
assembly
the
local
parliament
took
its
ancient
shape
of
an
armed
crowd
headed
by
the
noblest
englishmen
left
in
the
earldom
there
was
no
vote
no
debate
the
shout
was
rede
good
rede
slay
ye
the
and
to
that
cry
walcher
himself
and
his
companions
the
murderers
of
ligulf
among
them
were
slaughtered
by
the
raging
multitude
who
had
gathered
to
avenge
him
the
riot
in
which
walcher
died
was
no
real
revolt
against
government
such
a
local
rising
against
a
local
wrong
might
have
happened
in
the
like
case
under
edward
or
harold
no
government
could
leave
such
a
deed
unpunished
but
own
ideas
of
justice
would
have
been
fully
satisfied
by
the
blinding
or
mutilation
of
a
few
ringleaders
but
william
was
in
normandy
in
the
midst
of
domestic
and
political
cares
he
sent
his
brother
ode
to
restore
order
and
his
vengeance
was
frightful
the
land
was
harried
innocent
men
were
mutilated
and
put
to
death
others
saved
their
lives
by
bribes
earl
after
earl
was
set
over
a
land
so
hard
to
rule
a
certain
alberie
was
appointed
but
he
was
removed
as
unfit
the
fierce
bishop
geoffrey
of
coutances
tried
his
hand
and
resigned
at
the
time
of
death
the
earldom
was
held
by
nephew
robert
of
mowbray
a
stern
and
gloomy
stranger
but
whom
englishmen
reckoned
among
men
when
he
guarded
the
marches
of
england
against
the
scot
after
the
death
of
waltheof
william
seems
to
have
stayed
in
normandy
for
several
years
his
ill
luck
now
began
before
the
year
was
out
he
entered
we
know
not
why
on
a
breton
campaign
but
he
was
driven
from
dol
by
the
combined
forces
of
britanny
and
france
philip
was
ready
to
help
any
enemy
of
william
the
conqueror
had
now
for
the
first
time
suffered
defeat
in
his
own
person
he
made
peace
with
both
enemies
promising
his
daughter
constance
to
alan
of
britanny
but
the
marriage
did
not
follow
till
ten
years
later
the
peace
with
france
as
the
english
chronicle
says
little
while
philip
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
helping
eldest
son
robert
when
the
reckless
young
man
rebelled
against
his
father
with
most
of
the
qualities
of
an
accomplished
knight
robert
had
few
of
those
which
make
either
a
wise
ruler
or
an
honest
man
a
brave
soldier
even
a
skilful
captain
he
was
no
general
ready
of
speech
and
free
of
hand
he
was
lavish
rather
than
bountiful
he
did
not
lack
generous
and
noble
feelings
but
of
a
steady
course
even
in
evil
he
was
incapable
as
a
ruler
he
was
no
oppressor
in
his
own
person
but
sloth
carelessness
love
of
pleasure
incapacity
to
say
no
failure
to
do
justice
caused
more
wretchedness
than
the
oppression
of
those
tyrants
who
hinder
the
oppressions
of
others
william
would
not
set
such
an
one
over
any
part
of
his
dominions
before
his
time
and
it
was
his
policy
to
keep
his
children
dependent
on
him
while
he
enriched
his
brothers
he
did
not
give
the
smallest
scrap
of
the
spoils
of
england
to
his
sons
but
robert
deemed
that
he
had
a
right
to
something
greater
than
private
estates
the
nobles
of
normandy
had
done
homage
to
him
as
successor
he
had
done
homage
to
fulk
for
maine
as
if
he
were
himself
its
count
he
was
now
stirred
up
by
evil
companions
to
demand
that
if
his
father
would
not
give
him
part
of
his
spirit
of
edwin
and
morkere
had
crossed
the
would
at
least
give
him
normandy
and
maine
william
refused
with
many
pithy
sayings
it
was
not
his
manner
to
take
off
his
clothes
till
he
went
to
bed
robert
now
with
a
band
of
discontented
young
nobles
plunged
into
border
warfare
against
his
father
he
then
wandered
over
a
large
part
of
europe
begging
and
receiving
money
and
squandering
all
that
he
got
his
mother
too
sent
him
money
which
led
to
the
first
quarrel
between
william
and
matilda
after
so
many
years
of
faithful
union
william
rebuked
his
wife
for
helping
his
enemy
in
breach
of
his
orders
she
pleaded
the
love
for
her
the
mother
was
forgiven
but
her
messenger
sentenced
to
loss
of
eyes
found
shelter
in
a
monastery
at
last
in
philip
gave
robert
a
settled
in
the
of
gerberoi
the
strife
between
father
and
son
became
dangerous
william
besieged
the
castle
to
undergo
before
its
walls
his
second
defeat
to
receive
his
first
wound
and
that
at
the
hands
of
his
own
son
pierced
in
the
hand
by
the
lance
of
robert
his
horse
smitten
by
an
arrow
the
conqueror
fell
to
the
ground
and
was
saved
only
by
an
englishman
tokig
son
of
wiggod
of
wallingford
who
gave
his
life
for
his
king
it
seems
an
early
softening
of
the
tale
which
says
that
robert
dismounted
and
craved
his
pardon
it
seems
a
later
hardening
which
says
that
william
pronounced
a
curse
on
his
son
william
rufus
too
known
as
yet
only
as
the
dutiful
son
of
his
father
was
wounded
in
his
defence
the
blow
was
not
only
grievous
to
feelings
as
a
father
it
was
a
serious
military
defeat
the
two
wounded
williams
and
the
rest
of
the
besiegers
escaped
how
they
might
and
the
siege
of
gerberoi
was
raised
we
next
find
the
wise
men
of
normandy
debating
how
to
make
peace
between
father
and
son
in
the
course
of
the
year
a
peace
was
patched
up
and
a
more
honourable
sphere
was
found
for
energies
in
an
expedition
into
scotland
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
of
gerberoi
malcolm
had
made
another
wasting
inroad
into
northumberland
with
the
king
absent
and
northumberland
in
confusion
through
the
death
of
walcher
this
wrong
went
unavenged
till
the
autumn
of
robert
gained
no
special
glory
in
scotland
a
second
quarrel
with
his
father
followed
and
robert
remained
a
banished
man
during
the
last
seven
years
of
reign
in
this
same
year
a
synod
of
the
norman
church
was
held
the
truce
of
god
again
renewed
which
we
heard
of
years
ago
the
forms
of
outrage
on
which
the
truce
was
meant
to
put
a
cheek
and
which
the
strong
hand
of
william
had
put
down
more
thoroughly
than
the
truce
would
do
had
clearly
begun
again
during
the
confusions
caused
by
the
rebellion
of
robert
the
two
next
years
william
was
in
england
his
home
sorrows
were
now
pressing
heavily
on
him
his
eldest
son
was
a
rebel
and
an
exile
about
this
time
his
second
son
died
in
the
new
forest
according
to
one
version
his
daughter
the
betrothed
of
edwin
who
had
never
forgotten
her
english
lover
was
now
promised
to
the
spanish
king
alfonso
and
answer
to
her
own
the
marriage
was
celebrated
and
now
the
partner
of
life
was
taken
from
him
four
years
after
his
one
difference
with
her
on
november
matilda
died
after
a
long
sickness
to
her
lasting
grief
she
was
buried
in
her
own
church
at
caen
and
churches
in
england
received
gifts
from
william
on
behalf
of
her
soul
the
mourner
had
soon
again
to
play
the
warrior
nearly
the
whole
of
few
remaining
years
were
spent
in
a
struggle
which
in
earlier
times
he
would
surely
have
ended
in
a
day
maine
city
and
county
did
not
call
for
a
third
conquest
but
a
single
baron
of
maine
defied
power
and
a
single
castle
of
maine
held
out
against
him
for
three
years
hubert
viscount
of
beaumont
and
fresnay
revolted
on
some
slight
quarrel
the
siege
of
his
castle
of
went
on
from
the
death
of
matilda
till
the
last
year
but
one
of
reign
the
tale
is
full
of
picturesque
detail
but
william
had
little
personal
share
in
it
the
best
captains
of
normandy
tried
their
strength
in
vain
against
this
one
donjon
on
its
rock
william
at
last
made
peace
with
the
subject
who
was
too
strong
for
him
hubert
came
to
england
and
received
the
pardon
practically
the
pardon
was
the
other
way
thus
for
the
last
eleven
years
of
his
life
william
ceased
to
be
the
conqueror
engaged
only
in
small
enterprises
he
was
unsuccessful
in
all
one
last
success
was
indeed
in
store
for
him
but
that
was
to
be
purchased
with
his
own
life
as
he
turned
away
in
defeat
from
this
castle
and
that
as
he
felt
the
full
bitterness
of
domestic
sorrow
he
may
have
thought
as
others
thought
for
him
that
the
curse
of
waltheof
the
curse
of
the
new
forest
was
ever
tracking
his
steps
if
so
his
crimes
were
done
in
england
and
their
vengeance
came
in
normandy
in
england
there
was
no
further
room
for
his
mission
as
conqueror
he
had
no
longer
foes
to
overcome
he
had
an
act
of
justice
to
do
and
he
did
it
he
had
his
kingdom
to
guard
and
he
guarded
it
he
had
to
take
the
great
step
which
should
make
his
kingdom
one
for
ever
and
he
had
perhaps
without
fully
knowing
what
he
did
to
bid
the
picture
of
his
reign
be
painted
for
all
time
as
no
reign
before
or
after
has
been
painted
chapter
xi
the
last
years
of
william
of
two
events
of
these
last
years
of
the
reign
events
of
very
different
degrees
of
importance
we
have
already
spoken
the
welsh
expedition
of
william
was
the
only
recorded
fighting
on
british
ground
and
that
lay
without
the
bounds
of
the
kingdom
of
england
william
now
made
normandy
his
chief
but
he
was
constantly
called
over
to
england
the
welsh
campaign
proves
his
presence
in
england
in
he
was
again
in
england
in
but
he
went
back
to
normandy
between
the
two
visits
the
visit
of
was
a
memorable
one
there
is
no
more
characteristic
act
of
the
conqueror
than
the
deed
which
marks
it
the
cruelty
and
insolence
of
his
brother
ode
whom
he
had
trusted
so
much
more
than
he
deserved
had
passed
all
bounds
in
avenging
the
death
of
walcher
he
had
done
deeds
such
as
william
never
did
himself
or
allowed
any
other
man
to
do
and
now
beguiled
by
a
soothsayer
who
said
that
one
of
his
name
should
be
the
next
pope
he
dreamed
of
succeeding
to
the
throne
of
gregory
the
seventh
he
made
all
kinds
of
preparations
to
secure
his
succession
and
he
was
at
last
about
to
set
forth
for
italy
at
the
head
of
something
like
an
army
his
schemes
were
by
no
means
to
the
liking
of
his
brother
william
came
suddenly
over
from
normandy
and
met
ode
in
the
isle
of
wight
there
the
king
got
together
as
many
as
he
could
of
the
great
men
of
the
realm
before
them
he
arraigned
ode
for
all
his
crimes
he
had
left
him
as
the
lieutenant
of
his
kingdom
and
he
had
shown
himself
the
common
oppressor
of
every
class
of
men
in
the
realm
last
of
all
he
had
beguiled
the
warriors
who
were
needed
for
the
defence
of
england
against
the
danes
and
irish
to
follow
him
on
his
wild
schemes
in
italy
how
was
he
to
deal
with
such
a
brother
william
asked
of
his
wise
men
he
had
to
answer
himself
no
other
man
dared
to
speak
william
then
gave
his
judgement
the
common
enemy
of
the
whole
realm
should
not
be
spared
because
he
was
the
brother
he
should
be
seized
and
put
in
ward
as
none
dared
to
seize
him
the
king
seized
him
with
his
own
hands
and
now
for
the
first
time
in
england
we
hear
words
which
were
often
heard
again
the
bishop
stained
with
blood
and
sacrilege
appealed
to
the
privileges
of
his
order
he
was
a
clerk
a
bishop
no
man
might
judge
him
but
the
pope
william
taught
so
men
said
by
lanfranc
had
his
answer
ready
do
not
seize
a
clerk
or
a
bishop
i
seize
my
earl
whom
i
set
over
my
so
the
earl
of
kent
was
carried
off
to
a
prison
in
normandy
and
pope
gregory
himself
pleaded
in
vain
for
the
release
of
the
bishop
of
bayeux
the
mind
of
william
was
just
now
mainly
given
to
the
affairs
of
his
island
kingdom
in
the
winter
of
he
hastened
from
the
of
his
wife
to
the
siege
of
and
thence
to
the
midwinter
gemót
in
england
the
chief
object
of
the
assembly
was
the
specially
distasteful
one
of
laying
on
of
a
tax
in
the
course
of
the
next
year
six
shillings
was
levied
on
every
hide
of
land
to
meet
a
pressing
need
the
powers
of
the
north
were
again
threatening
the
danger
if
it
was
danger
was
greater
than
when
waltheof
smote
the
normans
in
the
gate
at
york
swegen
and
his
successor
harold
were
dead
cnut
the
saint
reigned
in
denmark
the
of
robert
of
flanders
this
alliance
with
enemy
joined
with
his
remembrance
of
his
own
two
failures
to
stir
up
the
danish
king
to
a
yearning
for
some
exploit
in
england
english
exiles
were
still
found
to
urge
him
to
the
enterprise
conquest
had
scattered
banished
or
discontented
englishmen
over
all
europe
many
had
made
their
way
to
the
eastern
rome
they
had
joined
the
warangian
guard
the
surest
support
of
the
imperial
throne
and
at
dyrrhachion
as
on
senlac
the
axe
of
england
had
met
the
lance
of
normandy
in
battle
others
had
fled
to
the
north
they
prayed
cnut
to
avenge
the
death
of
his
kinsman
harold
and
to
deliver
england
from
the
yoke
of
an
english
writer
living
in
denmark
spoke
of
roman
speech
thus
the
greek
at
one
end
of
europe
the
norman
at
the
other
still
kept
on
the
name
of
rome
the
fleet
of
denmark
was
joined
by
the
fleet
of
flanders
a
smaller
contingent
was
promised
by
the
devout
and
peaceful
olaf
of
norway
who
himself
felt
no
call
to
take
a
share
in
the
work
of
war
against
this
danger
william
strengthened
himself
by
the
help
of
the
tax
that
he
had
just
levied
he
could
hardly
have
dreamed
of
defending
england
against
danish
invaders
by
english
weapons
only
but
he
thought
as
little
of
trusting
the
work
to
his
own
normans
with
the
money
of
england
he
hired
a
host
of
mercenaries
horse
and
foot
from
france
and
britanny
even
from
maine
where
hubert
was
still
defying
him
at
he
gathered
this
force
on
the
mainland
and
came
back
at
its
head
a
force
such
as
england
had
never
before
seen
men
wondered
how
the
land
might
feed
them
all
the
men
french
and
english
had
to
feed
them
each
man
according
to
the
amount
of
his
land
and
now
william
did
what
harold
had
refused
to
do
he
laid
waste
the
whole
coast
that
lay
open
to
attack
from
denmark
and
flanders
but
no
danes
no
flemings
came
disputes
arose
between
cnut
and
his
brother
olaf
and
the
great
enterprise
came
to
nothing
william
kept
part
of
his
mercenaries
in
england
and
part
he
sent
to
their
homes
cnut
was
murdered
in
a
church
by
his
own
subjects
and
was
canonized
as
by
a
pope
who
could
not
speak
the
scandinavian
name
meanwhile
at
the
midwinter
gemót
of
held
in
due
form
at
gloucester
william
did
one
of
his
greatest
acts
king
had
mickle
thought
and
sooth
deep
speech
with
his
witan
about
his
land
how
it
were
set
and
with
whilk
in
that
speech
so
called
in
our
own
tongue
lurks
a
name
well
known
and
dear
to
every
englishman
the
result
of
that
famous
parliament
is
set
forth
at
length
by
the
chronicler
the
king
sent
his
men
into
each
shire
men
who
did
indeed
set
down
in
their
writ
how
the
land
was
set
and
of
what
men
in
that
writ
we
have
a
record
in
the
roman
tongue
no
less
precious
than
the
chronicles
in
our
own
for
that
writ
became
the
book
of
winchester
the
book
to
which
our
fathers
gave
the
name
of
domesday
the
book
of
judgement
that
spared
no
man
the
great
survey
was
made
in
the
course
of
the
first
seven
months
of
the
year
commissioners
were
sent
into
every
shire
who
inquired
by
the
oaths
of
the
men
of
the
hundreds
by
whom
the
land
had
been
held
in
king
days
and
what
it
was
worth
then
by
whom
it
was
held
at
the
time
of
the
survey
and
what
it
was
worth
then
and
lastly
whether
its
worth
could
be
raised
nothing
was
to
be
left
out
sooth
narrowly
did
he
let
spear
it
out
that
there
was
not
a
hide
or
a
yard
of
land
nor
is
shame
to
tell
and
it
thought
him
no
shame
to
ox
nor
a
cow
nor
a
swine
was
left
that
was
not
set
in
his
this
kind
of
searching
inquiry
never
liked
at
any
time
would
be
specially
grievous
then
the
taking
of
the
survey
led
to
disturbances
in
many
places
in
which
not
a
few
lives
were
lost
while
the
work
was
going
on
william
went
to
and
fro
till
he
knew
thoroughly
how
this
land
was
set
and
of
what
men
he
had
now
a
list
of
all
men
french
and
english
who
held
land
in
his
kingdom
and
it
was
not
enough
to
have
their
names
in
a
writ
he
would
see
them
face
to
face
on
the
making
of
the
survey
followed
that
great
assembly
that
great
work
of
legislation
which
was
the
crown
of
life
as
a
ruler
and
lawgiver
of
england
the
usual
assemblies
of
the
year
had
been
held
at
winchester
and
westminster
an
extraordinary
assembly
was
held
in
the
plain
of
salisbury
on
the
first
day
of
august
the
work
of
that
assembly
has
been
already
spoken
of
it
was
now
that
all
the
owners
of
land
in
the
kingdom
became
the
men
of
the
king
it
was
now
that
england
became
one
with
no
fear
of
being
again
parted
asunder
the
close
connexion
between
the
great
survey
and
the
law
and
the
oath
of
salisbury
is
plain
it
was
a
great
matter
for
the
king
to
get
in
the
gold
certainly
and
we
may
add
fairly
william
would
deal
with
no
man
otherwise
than
according
to
law
as
he
understood
the
law
but
he
sought
for
more
than
this
he
would
not
only
know
what
this
land
could
be
made
to
pay
he
would
know
the
state
of
his
kingdom
in
every
detail
he
would
know
its
military
strength
he
would
know
whether
his
own
will
in
the
long
process
of
taking
from
this
man
and
giving
to
that
had
been
really
carried
out
domesday
is
before
all
things
a
record
of
the
great
confiscation
a
record
of
that
gradual
change
by
which
in
less
than
twenty
years
the
greater
part
of
the
land
of
england
had
been
transferred
from
native
to
foreign
owners
and
nothing
shows
like
domesday
in
what
a
formally
legal
fashion
that
transfer
was
carried
out
what
were
the
principles
on
which
it
was
carried
out
we
have
already
seen
all
private
property
in
land
came
only
from
the
grant
of
king
william
it
had
all
passed
into
his
hands
by
lawful
forfeiture
he
might
keep
it
himself
he
might
give
it
back
to
its
old
owner
or
grant
it
to
a
new
one
so
it
was
at
the
general
redemption
of
lands
so
it
was
whenever
fresh
conquests
or
fresh
revolts
threw
fresh
lands
into
the
hands
the
principle
is
so
thoroughly
taken
for
granted
that
we
are
a
little
startled
to
find
it
incidentally
set
forth
in
so
many
words
in
a
case
of
no
special
importance
a
priest
named
robert
held
a
single
yardland
in
alms
of
the
king
he
became
a
monk
in
the
monastery
of
and
his
yardland
became
the
property
of
the
house
one
hardly
sees
why
this
case
should
have
been
picked
out
for
a
solemn
declaration
of
the
general
law
yet
as
day
on
which
the
english
redeemed
their
is
spoken
of
only
casually
in
the
case
of
a
particular
estate
so
the
principle
that
no
man
could
hold
lands
except
by
the
grant
licet
terram
alicui
habere
nisi
regis
is
brought
in
only
to
illustrate
the
wrongful
dealing
of
robert
and
the
monks
of
stow
in
the
case
of
a
very
small
holding
indeed
all
this
is
a
vast
system
of
legal
fictions
for
whole
position
the
whole
scheme
of
his
government
rested
on
a
system
of
legal
fictions
domesday
is
full
of
them
one
might
almost
say
that
there
is
nothing
else
there
a
very
attentive
study
of
domesday
might
bring
out
the
fact
that
william
was
a
foreign
conqueror
and
that
the
book
itself
was
a
record
of
the
process
by
which
he
took
the
lands
of
the
natives
who
had
fought
against
him
to
reward
the
strangers
who
had
fought
for
him
but
nothing
of
this
kind
appears
on
the
surface
of
the
record
the
great
facts
of
the
conquest
are
put
out
of
sight
william
is
taken
for
granted
not
only
as
the
lawful
king
but
as
the
immediate
successor
of
edward
the
of
king
and
the
of
king
are
the
two
times
that
the
law
knows
of
the
compilers
of
the
record
are
put
to
some
curious
shifts
to
describe
the
time
between
day
when
king
edward
was
alive
and
and
the
day
king
william
came
into
that
coming
might
have
been
as
peaceful
as
the
coming
of
james
the
first
or
george
the
first
the
two
great
battles
are
more
than
once
referred
to
but
only
casually
in
the
mention
of
particular
persons
a
very
sharp
critic
might
guess
that
one
of
them
had
something
to
do
with
king
coming
into
england
but
that
is
all
harold
appears
only
as
earl
it
is
only
in
two
or
three
places
that
we
hear
of
a
of
harold
and
even
of
harold
the
and
these
two
or
three
places
stand
out
in
such
contrast
to
the
general
language
of
the
record
that
we
are
led
to
think
that
the
scribe
must
have
copied
some
earlier
record
or
taken
down
the
words
of
some
witness
and
must
have
forgotten
to
translate
them
into
more
loyal
formulæ
so
in
recording
who
held
the
land
in
king
day
and
who
in
king
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
in
so
many
cases
the
holder
under
edward
had
been
turned
out
to
make
room
for
the
holder
under
william
the
former
holder
is
marked
by
the
perfectly
colourless
word
a
word
as
yet
meaning
not
but
of
any
kind
in
domesday
the
word
is
most
commonly
an
euphemism
for
it
is
a
still
more
distinct
euphemism
where
the
norman
holder
is
in
more
than
one
place
called
the
of
the
dispossessed
englishmen
the
formulæ
of
domesday
are
the
most
speaking
witness
to
the
spirit
of
outward
legality
which
ruled
every
act
of
william
in
this
way
they
are
wonderfully
instructive
but
from
the
formulæ
alone
no
one
could
ever
make
the
real
facts
of
coming
and
reign
it
is
the
incidental
notices
which
make
us
more
at
home
in
the
local
and
personal
life
of
this
reign
than
of
any
reign
before
or
for
a
long
time
after
the
commissioners
had
to
report
whether
the
will
had
been
everywhere
carried
out
whether
every
man
great
and
small
french
and
english
had
what
the
king
meant
him
to
have
neither
more
nor
less
and
they
had
often
to
report
a
state
of
things
different
from
what
the
king
had
meant
to
be
many
men
had
not
all
that
king
william
had
meant
them
to
have
and
many
others
had
much
more
normans
had
taken
both
from
englishmen
and
from
other
normans
englishmen
had
taken
from
englishmen
some
had
taken
from
ecclesiastical
bodies
some
had
taken
from
king
william
himself
nay
king
william
himself
holds
lands
which
he
ought
to
give
up
to
another
man
this
last
entry
at
least
shows
that
william
was
fully
ready
to
do
right
according
to
his
notions
of
right
so
also
the
two
brothers
are
set
down
among
the
chief
offenders
of
these
unlawful
holdings
of
land
marked
in
the
technical
language
of
the
survey
as
and
many
were
doubtless
real
cases
of
violent
seizure
without
excuse
even
according
to
reading
of
the
law
but
this
does
not
always
follow
even
when
the
language
of
the
survey
would
seem
to
imply
it
words
implying
violence
and
the
like
are
used
in
the
legal
language
of
all
ages
where
no
force
has
been
used
merely
to
mark
a
possession
as
illegal
we
are
startled
at
finding
the
apostle
paul
set
down
as
one
of
the
offenders
but
the
words
paulus
mean
no
more
than
that
the
canons
of
saint
church
in
london
held
lands
to
which
the
commissioners
held
that
they
had
no
good
title
it
is
these
cases
where
one
man
held
land
which
another
claimed
that
gave
opportunity
for
those
personal
details
stories
notices
of
tenures
and
customs
which
make
domesday
the
most
precious
store
of
knowledge
of
the
time
one
fruitful
and
instructive
source
of
dispute
comes
from
the
way
in
which
the
lands
in
this
or
that
district
were
commonly
granted
out
the
commonly
a
foreigner
received
all
the
lands
which
such
and
such
a
man
commonly
a
dispossessed
englishman
held
in
that
shire
or
district
the
grantee
stepped
exactly
into
the
place
of
the
he
inherited
all
his
rights
and
all
his
burthens
he
inherited
therewith
any
disputes
as
to
the
extent
of
the
lands
of
the
or
as
to
the
nature
of
his
tenure
and
new
disputes
arose
in
the
process
of
transfer
one
common
source
of
dispute
was
when
the
former
owner
besides
lands
which
were
strictly
his
own
held
lands
on
lease
subject
to
a
reversionary
interest
on
the
part
of
the
crown
or
the
church
the
lease
or
is
the
usual
church
lands
for
three
lives
to
return
to
the
church
at
the
end
of
the
third
life
was
very
common
if
the
was
himself
the
third
life
the
grantee
his
had
no
claim
to
the
land
and
in
any
case
he
could
take
in
only
with
all
its
existing
liabilities
but
the
grantee
often
took
possession
of
the
whole
of
the
land
held
by
the
as
if
it
were
all
alike
his
own
a
crowd
of
complaints
followed
from
all
manner
of
injured
persons
and
bodies
great
and
small
french
and
english
lay
and
clerical
the
commissioners
seem
to
have
fairly
heard
all
and
to
have
fairly
reported
all
for
the
king
to
judge
of
it
is
their
care
to
do
right
to
all
men
which
has
given
us
such
strange
glimpses
of
the
inner
life
of
an
age
which
had
none
like
it
before
or
after
the
general
survey
followed
by
the
general
homage
might
seem
to
mark
work
in
england
his
work
as
an
english
statesman
as
done
he
could
hardly
have
had
time
to
redress
the
many
cases
of
wrong
which
the
survey
laid
before
him
but
he
was
able
to
wring
yet
another
tax
out
of
the
nation
according
to
his
new
and
more
certain
register
he
then
for
the
last
time
crossed
to
normandy
with
his
new
hoard
the
chronicler
and
other
writers
of
the
time
dwell
on
the
physical
portents
of
these
two
years
the
storms
the
fires
the
plagues
the
sharp
hunger
the
deaths
of
famous
men
on
both
sides
of
the
sea
of
the
year
the
last
year
of
the
conqueror
it
needs
the
full
strength
of
our
ancient
tongue
to
set
forth
the
signs
and
wonders
the
king
had
left
england
safe
peaceful
thoroughly
bowed
down
under
the
yoke
cursing
the
ruler
who
taxed
her
and
granted
away
her
lands
yet
half
blessing
him
for
the
that
he
made
against
the
murderer
the
robber
and
the
ravisher
but
the
land
that
he
had
won
was
neither
to
see
his
end
nor
to
shelter
his
dust
one
last
gleam
of
success
was
after
so
many
reverses
to
crown
his
arms
but
it
was
success
which
was
indeed
unworthy
of
the
conqueror
who
had
entered
exeter
and
le
mans
in
peaceful
triumph
and
the
was
now
to
come
to
him
who
after
so
many
years
of
warfare
stooped
at
last
for
the
first
time
to
cruel
and
petty
havoc
without
an
object
the
of
france
and
normandy
the
french
vexin
the
land
of
which
mantes
is
the
capital
had
always
been
disputed
between
kingdom
and
duchy
border
wars
had
been
common
just
at
this
time
the
inroads
of
the
french
commanders
at
mantes
are
said
to
have
been
specially
destructive
william
not
only
demanded
redress
from
the
king
but
called
for
the
surrender
of
the
whole
vexin
what
followed
is
a
familiar
story
philip
makes
a
foolish
jest
on
the
bodily
state
of
his
great
rival
unable
just
then
to
carry
out
his
threats
king
of
the
english
lies
in
at
rouen
there
will
be
a
great
show
of
candles
at
his
as
at
alençon
in
his
youth
so
now
william
who
could
pass
by
real
injuries
was
stung
to
the
uttermost
by
personal
mockery
by
the
splendour
of
god
when
he
rose
up
again
he
would
light
a
hundred
thousand
candles
at
cost
he
kept
his
word
at
the
cost
of
subjects
the
ballads
of
the
day
told
how
he
went
forth
and
gathered
the
fruits
of
autumn
in
the
fields
and
orchards
and
vineyards
of
the
enemy
but
he
did
more
than
gather
fruits
the
candles
of
his
churching
were
indeed
lighted
in
the
burning
streets
of
mantes
the
picture
of
william
the
great
directing
in
person
mere
brutal
havoc
like
this
is
strange
even
after
the
harrying
of
northumberland
and
the
making
of
the
new
forest
riding
to
and
fro
among
the
flames
bidding
his
men
with
glee
to
heap
on
the
fuel
gladdened
at
the
sight
of
burning
houses
and
churches
a
false
step
of
his
horse
gave
him
his
carried
to
rouen
to
the
priory
of
saint
gervase
near
the
city
he
lingered
from
august
to
september
and
then
the
reign
and
life
of
the
conqueror
came
to
an
end
forsaken
by
his
children
his
body
stripped
and
well
nigh
forgotten
the
loyalty
of
one
honest
knight
herlwin
of
conteville
bears
his
body
to
his
grave
in
his
own
church
at
caen
his
very
grave
is
dispossessed
claims
the
ground
as
his
own
and
the
dead
body
of
the
conqueror
has
to
wait
while
its
last
is
bought
with
money
into
that
force
alone
can
thrust
his
bulky
frame
and
the
rites
of
his
burial
are
as
wildly
cut
short
as
were
the
rites
of
his
crowning
with
much
striving
he
had
at
last
won
his
seven
feet
of
ground
but
he
was
not
to
keep
it
for
ever
religious
warfare
broke
down
his
tomb
and
scattered
his
bones
save
one
treasured
relic
civil
revolution
swept
away
the
one
remaining
fragment
and
now
while
we
seek
in
vain
beneath
the
open
sky
for
the
rifled
tombs
of
harold
and
of
waltheof
a
stone
beneath
the
vault
of
saint
still
tells
us
where
the
bones
of
william
once
lay
but
where
they
lie
no
longer
there
is
no
need
to
doubt
the
striking
details
of
the
death
and
burial
of
the
conqueror
we
shrink
from
giving
the
same
trust
to
the
long
tale
of
penitence
which
is
put
into
the
mouth
of
the
dying
king
he
may
in
that
awful
hour
have
seen
the
of
the
last
years
of
his
life
he
hardly
threw
his
repentance
into
the
shape
of
a
detailed
autobiographical
confession
but
the
more
authentic
sayings
and
doings
of
enable
us
to
follow
his
course
as
an
english
statesman
almost
to
his
last
moments
his
end
was
one
of
devotion
of
prayers
and
almsgiving
and
of
opening
of
the
prison
to
them
that
were
bound
all
save
one
of
his
political
prisoners
english
and
norman
he
willingly
set
free
morkere
and
his
companions
from
ely
walfnoth
son
of
godwine
hostage
for
faith
wulf
son
of
harold
and
ealdgyth
taken
we
can
hardly
doubt
as
a
babe
when
chester
opened
its
gates
to
william
were
all
set
free
some
indeed
were
put
in
bonds
again
by
the
successor
but
ode
william
would
not
set
free
he
knew
too
well
how
many
would
suffer
if
he
were
again
let
loose
upon
the
world
but
love
of
kindred
was
still
strong
at
last
he
yielded
sorely
against
his
will
to
the
prayers
and
pledges
of
his
other
brother
ode
went
forth
from
his
prison
again
bishop
of
bayeux
soon
again
to
be
earl
of
kent
and
soon
to
prove
foresight
by
his
deeds
disposal
of
his
dominions
on
his
carries
on
his
political
history
almost
to
his
last
breath
robert
the
banished
rebel
might
seem
to
have
forfeited
all
claims
to
the
succession
but
the
doctrine
of
hereditary
right
had
strengthened
during
the
sixty
years
of
life
he
is
made
to
say
that
though
he
foresees
the
wretchedness
of
any
land
over
which
robert
should
be
the
ruler
still
he
can
not
keep
him
out
of
the
duchy
of
normandy
which
is
his
birthright
of
england
he
will
not
dare
to
dispose
he
leaves
the
decision
to
god
seemingly
to
archbishop
lanfranc
as
the
vicar
of
god
he
will
only
say
that
his
wish
is
for
his
son
william
to
succeed
him
in
his
kingdom
and
he
prays
lanfranc
to
crown
him
king
if
he
deem
such
a
course
to
be
right
such
a
message
was
a
virtual
nomination
and
william
the
red
succeeded
his
father
in
england
but
kept
his
crown
only
by
the
help
of
loyal
englishmen
against
norman
rebels
william
rufus
it
must
be
remembered
still
under
the
tutelage
of
his
father
and
lanfranc
had
not
yet
shown
his
bad
qualities
he
was
known
as
yet
only
as
the
dutiful
son
who
fought
for
his
father
against
the
rebel
robert
by
ancient
english
law
that
strong
preference
which
was
all
that
any
man
could
claim
of
right
belonged
beyond
doubt
to
the
youngest
of
sons
the
english
ætheling
henry
he
alone
was
born
in
the
land
he
alone
was
the
son
of
a
crowned
king
and
his
lady
it
is
perhaps
with
a
knowledge
of
what
followed
that
william
is
made
to
bid
his
youngest
son
wait
while
his
eldest
go
before
him
that
he
left
him
landless
but
master
of
a
hoard
of
silver
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
english
feeling
which
welcomed
henry
thirteen
years
later
would
doubtless
have
gladly
seen
his
immediate
accession
but
it
might
have
been
hard
in
dividing
dominions
to
have
shut
out
the
second
son
in
favour
of
the
third
and
in
the
scheme
of
events
by
which
conquered
england
was
to
rise
again
the
reign
of
rufus
at
the
moment
the
darkest
time
of
all
had
its
appointed
share
that
england
could
rise
again
that
she
could
rise
with
a
new
life
strengthened
by
her
momentary
overthrow
was
before
all
things
owing
to
the
lucky
destiny
which
if
she
was
to
be
conquered
gave
her
william
the
great
as
her
conqueror
it
is
as
it
is
in
all
human
affairs
william
himself
could
not
have
done
all
that
he
did
wittingly
and
unwittingly
unless
circumstances
had
been
favourable
to
him
but
favourable
circumstances
would
have
been
useless
unless
there
had
been
a
man
like
william
to
take
advantage
of
them
what
he
did
wittingly
or
unwittingly
he
did
by
virtue
of
his
special
position
the
position
of
a
foreign
conqueror
veiling
his
conquest
under
a
legal
claim
the
hour
and
the
man
were
alike
needed
the
man
in
his
own
hour
wrought
a
work
partly
conscious
partly
unconscious
the
more
clearly
any
man
understands
his
conscious
work
the
more
sure
is
that
conscious
work
to
lead
to
further
results
of
which
he
dreams
not
so
it
was
with
the
conqueror
of
england
his
purpose
was
to
win
and
to
keep
the
kingdom
of
england
and
to
hand
it
on
to
those
who
should
come
after
him
more
firmly
united
than
it
had
ever
been
before
in
this
work
his
spirit
of
formal
legality
his
shrinking
from
needless
change
stood
him
in
good
stead
he
saw
that
as
the
kingdom
of
england
could
best
be
won
by
putting
forth
a
legal
claim
to
it
so
it
could
best
be
kept
by
putting
on
the
character
of
a
legal
ruler
and
reigning
as
the
successor
of
the
old
kings
seeking
the
unity
of
the
kingdom
he
saw
from
the
example
both
of
england
and
of
other
lands
the
dangers
which
threatened
that
unity
he
saw
what
measures
were
needed
to
preserve
it
in
his
own
day
measures
which
have
preserved
it
ever
since
here
is
a
work
a
conscious
work
which
entitles
the
foreign
conqueror
to
a
place
among
english
statesmen
and
to
a
place
in
their
highest
rank
further
than
this
we
can
not
conceive
william
himself
to
have
looked
all
that
was
to
come
of
his
work
in
future
ages
was
of
necessity
hidden
from
his
eyes
no
less
than
from
the
eyes
of
smaller
men
he
had
assuredly
no
formal
purpose
to
make
england
norman
but
still
less
had
he
any
thought
that
the
final
outcome
of
his
work
would
make
england
on
one
side
more
truly
english
than
if
he
had
never
crossed
the
sea
in
his
ecclesiastical
work
he
saw
the
future
still
less
clearly
he
designed
to
reform
what
he
deemed
abuses
to
bring
the
english
church
into
closer
conformity
with
the
other
churches
of
the
west
he
assuredly
never
dreamed
that
the
issue
of
his
reform
would
be
the
strife
between
henry
and
thomas
and
the
humiliation
of
john
his
error
was
that
of
forgetting
that
he
himself
could
wield
powers
that
he
could
hold
forces
in
check
which
would
be
too
strong
for
those
who
should
come
after
him
at
his
purposes
with
regard
to
the
relations
of
england
and
normandy
it
would
be
vain
to
guess
the
mere
leaving
of
kingdom
and
duchy
to
different
sons
would
not
necessarily
imply
that
he
designed
a
complete
or
lasting
separation
but
assuredly
william
did
not
foresee
that
england
dragged
into
wars
with
france
as
the
ally
of
normandy
would
remain
the
lasting
rival
of
france
after
normandy
had
been
swallowed
up
in
the
french
kingdom
if
rivalry
between
england
and
france
had
not
come
in
this
way
it
would
doubtless
have
come
in
some
other
way
but
this
is
the
way
in
which
it
did
come
about
as
a
result
of
the
union
of
normandy
and
england
under
one
ruler
it
was
part
of
work
but
a
work
of
which
william
had
no
thought
so
it
was
with
the
increased
connexion
of
every
kind
between
england
and
the
continent
of
europe
which
followed
on
coming
with
one
part
of
europe
indeed
the
connexion
of
england
was
lessened
for
three
centuries
before
coming
dealings
in
war
and
peace
with
the
scandinavian
kingdoms
had
made
up
a
large
part
of
english
history
since
the
baffled
enterprise
of
the
holy
cnut
our
dealings
with
that
part
of
europe
have
been
of
only
secondary
account
but
in
our
view
of
william
as
an
english
statesman
the
main
feature
of
all
is
that
spirit
of
formal
legality
of
which
we
have
so
often
spoken
its
direct
effects
partly
designed
partly
undesigned
have
affected
our
whole
history
to
this
day
it
was
his
policy
to
disguise
the
fact
of
conquest
to
cause
all
the
spoils
of
conquest
to
be
held
in
outward
form
according
to
the
ancient
law
of
england
the
fiction
became
a
fact
and
the
fact
greatly
helped
in
the
process
of
fusion
between
normans
and
english
the
conquering
race
could
not
keep
itself
distinct
from
the
conquered
and
the
form
which
the
fusion
took
was
for
the
conquerors
to
be
lost
in
the
greater
mass
of
the
conquered
william
founded
no
new
state
no
new
nation
no
new
constitution
he
simply
kept
what
he
found
with
such
modifications
as
his
position
made
needful
but
without
any
formal
change
in
the
nature
of
english
kingship
his
position
enabled
him
to
clothe
the
crown
with
a
practical
power
such
as
it
had
never
held
before
to
make
his
rule
in
short
a
virtual
despotism
these
two
facts
determined
the
later
course
of
english
history
and
they
determined
it
to
the
lasting
good
of
the
english
nation
the
conservative
instincts
of
william
allowed
our
national
life
and
our
national
institutions
to
live
on
unbroken
through
his
conquest
but
it
was
before
all
things
the
despotism
of
william
his
despotism
under
legal
forms
which
preserved
our
national
institutions
to
all
time
as
a
less
discerning
conqueror
might
have
swept
our
ancient
laws
and
liberties
away
so
under
a
series
of
native
kings
those
laws
and
liberties
might
have
died
out
as
they
died
out
in
so
many
continental
lands
but
the
despotism
of
the
crown
called
forth
the
national
spirit
in
a
conscious
and
antagonistic
shape
it
called
forth
that
spirit
in
men
of
both
races
alike
and
made
normans
and
english
one
people
the
old
institutions
lived
on
to
be
clothed
with
a
fresh
life
to
be
modified
as
changed
circumstances
might
make
needful
the
despotism
of
the
norman
kings
the
peculiar
character
of
that
despotism
enabled
the
great
revolution
of
the
thirteenth
century
to
take
the
forms
which
it
took
at
once
conservative
and
progressive
so
it
was
when
more
than
four
centuries
after
day
england
again
saw
a
despotism
carried
on
under
the
forms
of
law
henry
the
eighth
reigned
as
william
had
reigned
he
did
not
reign
like
his
brother
despots
on
the
continent
the
forms
of
law
and
freedom
lived
on
in
the
seventeenth
century
therefore
as
in
the
thirteenth
the
forms
stood
ready
to
be
again
clothed
with
a
new
life
to
supply
the
means
for
another
revolution
again
at
once
conservative
and
progressive
it
has
been
remarked
a
thousand
times
that
while
other
nations
have
been
driven
to
destroy
and
to
rebuild
the
political
fabric
in
england
we
have
never
had
to
destroy
and
to
rebuild
but
have
found
it
enough
to
repair
to
enlarge
and
to
improve
this
characteristic
of
english
history
is
mainly
owing
to
the
events
of
the
eleventh
century
and
owing
above
all
to
the
personal
agency
of
william
as
far
as
mortal
man
can
guide
the
course
of
things
when
he
is
gone
the
course
of
our
national
history
since
day
has
been
the
result
of
character
and
of
acts
well
may
we
restore
to
him
the
surname
that
men
gave
him
in
his
own
day
he
may
worthily
take
his
place
as
william
the
great
alongside
of
alexander
constantine
and
charles
they
may
have
wrought
in
some
