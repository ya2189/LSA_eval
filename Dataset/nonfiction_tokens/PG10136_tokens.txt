first
published
in
a
bound
edition
preface
i
must
frankly
own
that
if
i
had
known
beforehand
that
this
book
would
have
cost
me
the
labour
which
it
has
i
should
never
have
been
courageous
enough
to
commence
it
what
moved
me
in
the
first
instance
to
attempt
a
work
like
this
was
the
discomfort
and
suffering
which
i
had
seen
brought
upon
men
and
women
by
household
mismanagement
i
have
always
thought
that
there
is
no
more
fruitful
source
of
family
discontent
than
a
housewife
dinners
and
untidy
ways
men
are
now
so
well
served
out
of
doors
at
their
clubs
taverns
and
that
in
order
to
compete
with
the
attractions
of
these
places
a
mistress
must
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
theory
and
practice
of
cookery
as
well
as
be
perfectly
conversant
with
all
the
other
arts
of
making
and
keeping
a
comfortable
home
in
this
book
i
have
attempted
to
give
under
the
chapters
devoted
to
cookery
an
intelligible
arrangement
to
every
recipe
a
list
of
the
a
plain
statement
of
the
of
preparing
each
dish
and
a
careful
estimate
of
its
the
of
for
whom
it
is
and
the
time
when
it
is
for
the
matter
of
the
recipes
i
am
indebted
in
some
measure
to
many
correspondents
of
the
englishwoman
domestic
magazine
who
have
obligingly
placed
at
my
disposal
their
formulas
for
many
original
preparations
a
large
private
circle
has
also
rendered
me
considerable
service
a
diligent
study
of
the
works
of
the
best
modern
writers
on
cookery
was
also
necessary
to
the
faithful
fulfilment
of
my
task
friends
in
england
scotland
ireland
france
and
germany
have
also
very
materially
aided
me
i
have
paid
great
attention
to
those
recipes
which
come
under
the
head
of
cold
meat
cookery
but
in
the
department
belonging
to
the
cook
i
have
striven
too
to
make
my
work
something
more
than
a
cookery
book
and
have
therefore
on
the
best
authority
that
i
could
obtain
given
an
account
of
the
natural
history
of
the
animals
and
vegetables
which
we
use
as
food
i
have
followed
the
animal
from
his
birth
to
his
appearance
on
the
table
have
described
the
manner
of
feeding
him
and
of
slaying
him
the
position
of
his
various
joints
and
after
giving
the
recipes
have
described
the
modes
of
carving
meat
poultry
and
game
skilful
artists
have
designed
the
numerous
drawings
which
appear
in
this
work
and
which
illustrate
better
than
any
description
many
important
and
interesting
items
the
coloured
plates
are
a
novelty
not
without
value
besides
the
great
portion
of
the
book
which
has
especial
reference
to
the
cook
department
there
are
chapters
devoted
to
those
of
the
other
servants
of
the
household
who
have
all
i
trust
their
duties
clearly
assigned
to
them
towards
the
end
of
the
work
will
be
found
valuable
chapters
on
the
management
of
children
the
doctor
the
latter
principally
referring
to
accidents
and
emergencies
some
of
which
are
certain
to
occur
in
the
experience
of
every
one
of
us
and
the
last
chapter
contains
legal
memoranda
which
will
be
serviceable
in
cases
of
doubt
as
to
the
proper
course
to
be
adopted
in
the
relations
between
landlord
and
tenant
and
and
tradesman
and
customer
these
chapters
have
been
contributed
by
gentlemen
fully
entitled
to
confidence
those
on
medical
subjects
by
an
experienced
surgeon
and
the
legal
matter
by
a
solicitor
i
wish
here
to
acknowledge
the
kind
letters
and
congratulations
i
have
received
during
the
progress
of
this
work
and
have
only
further
to
add
that
i
trust
the
result
of
the
four
years
incessant
labour
which
i
have
expended
will
not
be
altogether
unacceptable

xxxi
i
as
with
the
commander
of
an
army
or
the
leader
of
any
enterprise
so
is
it
with
the
mistress
of
a
house
her
spirit
will
be
seen
through
the
whole
establishment
and
just
in
proportion
as
she
performs
her
duties
intelligently
and
thoroughly
so
will
her
domestics
follow
in
her
path
of
all
those
acquirements
which
more
particularly
belong
to
the
feminine
character
there
are
none
which
take
a
higher
rank
in
our
estimation
than
such
as
enter
into
a
knowledge
of
household
duties
for
on
these
are
perpetually
dependent
the
happiness
comfort
and
of
a
family
in
this
opinion
we
are
borne
out
by
the
author
of
the
vicar
of
wakefield
who
says
the
modest
virgin
the
prudent
wife
and
the
careful
matron
are
much
more
serviceable
in
life
than
petticoated
philosophers
blustering
heroines
or
virago
queens
she
who
makes
her
husband
and
her
children
happy
who
reclaims
the
one
from
vice
and
trains
up
the
other
to
virtue
is
a
much
greater
character
than
ladies
described
in
romances
whose
whole
occupation
is
to
murder
mankind
with
shafts
from
their
quiver
or
their
eyes
pursuing
this
picture
we
may
add
that
to
be
a
good
housewife
does
not
necessarily
imply
an
abandonment
of
proper
pleasures
or
amusing
recreation
and
we
think
it
the
more
necessary
to
express
this
as
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
a
mistress
may
to
some
minds
perhaps
seem
to
be
incompatible
with
the
enjoyment
of
life
let
us
however
now
proceed
to
describe
some
of
those
home
qualities
and
virtues
which
are
necessary
to
the
proper
management
of
a
household
and
then
point
out
the
plan
which
may
be
the
most
profitably
pursued
for
the
daily
regulation
of
its
affairs
early
rising
is
one
of
the
most
essential
qualities
which
enter
into
good
household
management
as
it
is
not
only
the
parent
of
health
but
of
innumerable
other
advantages
indeed
when
a
mistress
is
an
early
riser
it
is
almost
certain
that
her
house
will
be
orderly
and
on
the
contrary
if
she
remain
in
bed
till
a
late
hour
then
the
domestics
who
as
we
have
before
observed
invariably
partake
somewhat
of
their
mistress
character
will
surely
become
sluggards
to
all
are
more
or
less
disposed
and
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
servants
are
freer
from
this
fault
than
the
heads
of
houses
the
great
lord
chatham
thus
gave
his
advice
in
reference
to
this
subject
i
would
have
inscribed
on
the
curtains
of
your
bed
and
the
walls
of
your
chamber
you
do
not
rise
early
you
can
make
progress
in
nothing
cleanliness
is
also
indispensable
to
health
and
must
be
studied
both
in
regard
to
the
person
and
the
house
and
all
that
it
contains
cold
or
tepid
baths
should
be
employed
every
morning
unless
on
account
of
illness
or
other
circumstances
they
should
be
deemed
objectionable
the
bathing
of
will
be
treated
of
under
the
head
of
management
of
children
frugality
and
economy
are
home
virtues
without
which
no
household
can
prosper
johnson
says
frugality
may
be
termed
the
daughter
of
prudence
the
sister
of
temperance
and
the
parent
of
liberty
he
that
is
extravagant
will
quickly
become
poor
and
poverty
will
enforce
dependence
and
invite
corruption
the
necessity
of
practising
economy
should
be
evident
to
every
one
whether
in
the
possession
of
an
income
no
more
than
sufficient
for
a
family
requirements
or
of
a
large
fortune
which
puts
financial
adversity
out
of
the
question
we
must
always
remember
that
it
is
a
great
merit
in
housekeeping
to
manage
a
little
well
he
is
a
good
waggoner
says
bishop
hall
that
can
turn
in
a
little
room
to
live
well
in
abundance
is
the
praise
of
the
estate
not
of
the
person
i
will
study
more
how
to
give
a
good
account
of
my
little
than
how
to
make
it
more
in
this
there
is
true
wisdom
and
it
may
be
added
that
those
who
can
manage
a
little
well
are
most
likely
to
succeed
in
their
management
of
larger
matters
economy
and
frugality
must
never
however
be
allowed
to
degenerate
into
parsimony
and
meanness
the
choice
of
acquaintances
is
very
important
to
the
happiness
of
a
mistress
and
her
family
a
gossiping
acquaintance
who
indulges
in
the
scandal
and
ridicule
of
her
neighbours
should
be
avoided
as
a
pestilence
it
is
likewise
to
beware
as
thomson
sings
the
whisper
tale
that
like
the
fabling
nile
no
fountain
knows
deceit
whose
wily
conscious
aye
looks
direct
the
tongue
that
licks
the
dust
but
when
it
safely
dares
as
prompt
to
sting
if
the
duties
of
a
family
do
not
sufficiently
occupy
the
time
of
a
mistress
society
should
be
formed
of
such
a
kind
as
will
tend
to
the
mutual
interchange
of
general
and
interesting
information
friendships
should
not
be
hastily
formed
nor
the
heart
given
at
once
to
every
there
are
ladies
who
uniformly
smile
at
and
approve
everything
and
everybody
and
who
possess
neither
the
courage
to
reprehend
vice
nor
the
generous
warmth
to
defend
virtue
the
friendship
of
such
persons
is
without
attachment
and
their
love
without
affection
or
even
preference
they
imagine
that
every
one
who
has
any
penetration
is
and
look
coldly
on
a
discriminating
judgment
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
this
discernment
does
not
always
proceed
from
an
uncharitable
temper
but
that
those
who
possess
a
long
experience
and
thorough
knowledge
of
the
world
scrutinize
the
conduct
and
dispositions
of
people
before
they
trust
themselves
to
the
first
fair
appearances
addison
who
was
not
deficient
in
a
knowledge
of
mankind
observes
that
a
friendship
which
makes
the
least
noise
is
very
often
the
most
useful
for
which
reason
i
should
prefer
a
prudent
friend
to
a
zealous
one
and
joanna
baillie
tells
us
that
friendship
is
no
plant
of
hasty
growth
though
planted
in
esteem
soil
the
gradual
culture
of
kind
intercourse
must
bring
it
to
perfection
hospitality
is
a
most
excellent
virtue
but
care
must
be
taken
that
the
love
of
company
for
its
own
sake
does
not
become
a
prevailing
passion
for
then
the
habit
is
no
longer
hospitality
but
dissipation
reality
and
truthfulness
in
this
as
in
all
other
duties
of
life
are
the
points
to
be
studied
for
as
washington
irving
well
says
there
is
an
emanation
from
the
heart
in
genuine
hospitality
which
can
not
be
described
but
is
immediately
felt
and
puts
the
stranger
at
once
at
his
ease
with
respect
to
the
continuance
of
friendships
however
it
may
be
found
necessary
in
some
cases
for
a
mistress
to
relinquish
on
assuming
the
responsibility
of
a
household
many
of
those
commenced
in
the
earlier
part
of
her
life
this
will
be
the
more
requisite
if
the
number
still
retained
be
quite
equal
to
her
means
and
opportunities
in
conversation
trifling
occurrences
such
as
small
disappointments
petty
annoyances
and
other
incidents
should
never
be
mentioned
to
your
friends
the
extreme
injudiciousness
of
repeating
these
will
be
at
once
apparent
when
we
reflect
on
the
unsatisfactory
discussions
which
they
too
frequently
occasion
and
on
the
load
of
advice
which
they
are
the
cause
of
being
tendered
and
which
is
too
often
of
a
kind
neither
to
be
useful
nor
agreeable
greater
events
whether
of
joy
or
sorrow
should
be
communicated
to
friends
and
on
such
occasions
their
sympathy
gratifies
and
comforts
if
the
mistress
be
a
wife
never
let
an
account
of
her
husband
failings
pass
her
lips
and
in
cultivating
the
power
of
conversation
she
should
keep
the
versified
advice
of
cowper
continually
in
her
memory
that
it
should
flow
like
water
after
summer
showers
not
as
if
raised
by
mere
mechanic
powers
in
reference
to
its
style
johnson
who
was
himself
greatly
distinguished
for
his
colloquial
abilities
says
that
no
style
is
more
extensively
acceptable
than
the
narrative
because
this
does
not
carry
an
air
of
superiority
over
the
rest
of
the
company
and
therefore
is
most
likely
to
please
them
for
this
purpose
we
should
store
our
memory
with
short
anecdotes
and
entertaining
pieces
of
history
almost
every
one
listens
with
eagerness
to
extemporary
history
vanity
often
with
curiosity
for
he
that
is
a
hearer
in
one
place
wishes
to
qualify
himself
to
be
a
principal
speaker
in
some
inferior
company
and
therefore
more
attention
is
given
to
narrations
than
anything
else
in
conversation
it
is
true
indeed
that
sallies
of
wit
and
quick
replies
are
very
pleasing
in
conversation
but
they
frequently
tend
to
raise
envy
in
some
of
the
company
but
the
narrative
way
neither
raises
this
nor
any
other
evil
passion
but
keeps
all
the
company
nearly
upon
an
equality
and
if
judiciously
managed
will
at
once
entertain
and
improve
them
all
good
temper
should
be
cultivated
by
every
mistress
as
upon
it
the
welfare
of
the
household
may
be
said
to
turn
indeed
its
influence
can
hardly
be
as
it
has
the
effect
of
moulding
the
characters
of
those
around
her
and
of
acting
most
beneficially
on
the
happiness
of
the
domestic
circle
every
head
of
a
household
should
strive
to
be
cheerful
and
should
never
fail
to
show
a
deep
interest
in
all
that
appertains
to
the
of
those
who
claim
the
protection
of
her
roof
gentleness
not
partial
and
temporary
but
universal
and
regular
should
pervade
her
conduct
for
where
such
a
spirit
is
habitually
manifested
it
not
only
delights
her
children
but
makes
her
domestics
attentive
and
respectful
her
visitors
are
also
pleased
by
it
and
their
happiness
is
increased
on
the
important
subject
of
dress
and
fashion
we
can
not
do
better
than
quote
an
opinion
from
the
eighth
volume
of
the
domestic
magazine
the
writer
there
says
let
people
write
talk
lecture
satirize
as
they
may
it
can
not
be
denied
that
whatever
is
the
prevailing
mode
in
attire
let
it
intrinsically
be
ever
so
absurd
it
will
never
as
ridiculous
as
another
or
as
any
other
which
however
convenient
comfortable
or
even
becoming
is
totally
opposite
in
style
to
that
generally
worn
in
purchasing
articles
of
wearing
apparel
whether
it
be
a
silk
dress
a
bonnet
shawl
or
riband
it
is
well
for
the
buyer
to
consider
three
things
i
that
it
be
not
too
expensive
for
her
purse
ii
that
its
colour
harmonize
with
her
complexion
and
its
size
and
pattern
with
her
figure
iii
that
its
tint
allow
of
its
being
worn
with
the
other
garments
she
possesses
the
quaint
fuller
observes
that
the
good
wife
is
none
of
our
dainty
dames
who
love
to
appear
in
a
variety
of
suits
every
day
new
as
if
a
gown
like
a
stratagem
in
war
were
to
be
used
but
once
but
our
good
wife
sets
up
a
sail
according
to
the
keel
of
her
husband
estate
and
if
of
high
parentage
she
doth
not
so
remember
what
she
was
by
birth
that
she
forgets
what
she
is
by
match
to
or
those
ladies
having
dark
complexions
silks
of
a
grave
hue
are
adapted
for
or
those
having
fair
complexions
lighter
colours
are
preferable
as
the
richer
deeper
hues
are
too
overpowering
for
the
latter
the
colours
which
go
best
together
are
green
with
violet
with
dark
crimson
or
lilac
pale
blue
with
scarlet
pink
with
black
or
white
and
gray
with
scarlet
or
pink
a
cold
colour
generally
requires
a
warm
tint
to
give
life
to
it
gray
and
pale
blue
for
instance
do
not
combine
well
both
being
cold
colours
the
dress
of
the
mistress
should
always
be
adapted
to
her
circumstances
and
be
varied
with
different
occasions
thus
at
breakfast
she
should
be
attired
in
a
very
neat
and
simple
manner
wearing
no
ornaments
if
this
dress
should
decidedly
pertain
only
to
the
and
be
specially
suited
for
such
domestic
occupations
as
usually
follow
that
meal
then
it
would
be
well
to
exchange
it
before
the
time
for
receiving
visitors
if
the
mistress
be
in
the
habit
of
doing
so
it
is
still
to
be
remembered
however
that
in
changing
the
dress
jewellery
and
ornaments
are
not
to
be
worn
until
the
full
dress
for
dinner
is
assumed
further
information
and
hints

the
subject
of
the

charity

as
to
her

that

beyond

the
only
practical
way
really
to
understand
the

of

and
although
there
may
be
difficulties
in

in

metropolis
and

large
cities
yet
in
country
towns

districts

respect
to
all

there
will
be

for

and

and

manner

that
the
best
articles

the
cheapest
may
be
laid
down
as
a
rule
and
it
is
desirable
unless
an
experienced
and
confidential
housekeeper
be
kept
that
the
mistress
should
herself
purchase
all
provisions
and
stores
needed
for
the
house
if
the
mistress
be
a
young
wife
and
not
accustomed
to
order
things
for
the
house
a
little
practice
and
experience
will
soon
teach
her
who
are
the
best

to
deal
with
and
what
are
the
best
provisions
to
buy
under
each
particular
head
of
fish
meat
poultry
game
will
be
described
the
proper
means
of
ascertaining
the
quality
of
these
comestibles
a
housekeeping
should
invariably
be
kept
and
kept
punctually
and
precisely
the
plan
for
keeping
household
accounts
which
we
should
recommend
would
be
to
make
an
entry
that
is
write
down
into
a
daily
diary
every
amount
paid
on
that
particular
day
be
it
ever
so
small
then
at
the
end
of
the
month
let
these
various
payments
be
ranged
under
their
specific
heads
of
butcher
baker
and
thus
will
be
seen
the
proportions
paid
to
each
tradesman
and
any
one
expenses
may
be
contrasted
with
another
the
housekeeping
accounts
should
be
balanced
not
less
than
once
a
month
so
that
you
may
see
that
the
money
you
have
in
hand
tallies
with
your
account
of
it
in
your
diary
judge
haliburton
never
wrote
truer
words
than
when
he
said
no
man
is
rich
whose
expenditure
exceeds
his
means
and
no
one
is
poor
whose
incomings
exceed
his
outgoings
when
in
a
large
establishment
a
housekeeper
is
kept
it
will
be
advisable
for
the
mistress
to
examine
her
accounts
regularly
then
any
increase
of
expenditure
which
may
be
apparent
can
easily
be
explained
and
the
housekeeper
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
whether
her
efforts
to
manage
her
department
well
and
economically
have
been
successful
engaging
domestics
is
one
of
those
duties
in
which
the
judgment
of
the
mistress
must
be
keenly
exercised
there
are
some
respectable
where
good
servants
may
sometimes
be
hired
but
the
plan
rather
to
be
recommended
is
for
the
mistress
to
make
inquiry
amongst
her
circle
of
friends
and
acquaintances
and
her
tradespeople
the
latter
generally
know
those
in
their
neighbourhood
who
are
wanting
situations
and
will
communicate
with
them
when
a
personal
interview
with
some
of
them
will
enable
the
mistress
to
form
some
idea
of
the
characters
of
the
applicants
and
to
suit
herself
accordingly
we
would
here
point
out
an
error
and
a
grave
one
it
is
into
which
some
mistresses
fall
they
do
not
when
engaging
a
servant
expressly
tell
her
all
the
duties
which
she
will
be
expected
to
perform
this
is
an
act
of
omission
severely
to
be
reprehended
every
portion
of
work
which
the
maid
will
have
to
do
should
be
plainly
stated
by
the
mistress
and
understood
by
the
servant
if
this
plan
is
not
carefully
adhered
to
domestic
contention
is
almost
certain
to
ensue
and
this
may
not
be
easily
settled
so
that
a
change
of
servants
which
is
so
much
to
be
deprecated
is
continually
occurring
in
obtaining
a
servant
character
it
is
not
well
to
be
guided
by
a
written
one
from
some
unknown
quarter
but
it
is
better
to
have
an
interview
if
at
all
possible
with
the
former
mistress
by
this
means
you
will
be
assisted
in
your
decision
of
the
suitableness
of
the
servant
for
your
place
from
the
appearance
of
the
lady
and
the
state
of
her
house
negligence
and
want
of
cleanliness
in
her
and
her
household
generally
will
naturally
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
her
servant
has
suffered
from
the
influence
of
the
bad
example
the
proper
course
to
pursue
in
order
to
obtain
a
personal
interview
with
the
lady
is
this
the
servant
in
search
of
the
situation
must
be
desired
to
see
her
former
mistress
and
ask
her
to
be
kind
enough
to
appoint
a
time
convenient
to
herself
when
you
may
call
on
her
this
proper
observance
of
courtesy
being
necessary
to
prevent
any
unseasonable
intrusion
on
the
part
of
a
stranger
your
first
questions
should
be
relative
to
the
honesty
and
general
morality
of
her
former
servant
and
if
no
objection
is
stated
in
that
respect
her
other
qualifications
are
then
to
be
ascertained
inquiries
should
be
very
minute
so
that
you
may
avoid
disappointment
and
trouble
by
knowing
the
weak
points
of
your
domestic
the
treatment
of
servants
is
of
the
highest
possible
moment
as
well
to
the
mistress
as
to
the
domestics
themselves
on
the
head
of
the
house
the
latter
will
naturally
fix
their
attention
and
if
they
perceive
that
the
mistress
conduct
is
regulated
by
high
and
correct
principles
they
will
not
fail
to
respect
her
if
also
a
benevolent
desire
is
shown
to
promote
their
comfort
at
the
same
time
that
a
steady
performance
of
their
duty
is
exacted
then
their
respect
will
not
be
unmingled
with
affection
and
they
will
be
still
more
solicitous
to
continue
to
deserve
her
favour
in
giving
a
character
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
the
mistress
should
be
guided
by
a
sense
of
strict
justice
it
is
not
fair
for
one
lady
to
recommend
to
another
a
servant
she
would
not
keep
herself
the
benefit
too
to
the
servant
herself
is
of
small
advantage
for
the
failings
which
she
possesses
will
increase
if
suffered
to
be
indulged
with
impunity
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
remark
on
the
other
hand
that
no
angry
feelings
on
the
part
of
a
mistress
towards
her
late
servant
should
ever
be
allowed
in
the
slightest
degree
to
influence
her
so
far
as
to
induce
her
to
disparage
her
maid

relative
to
the
moral
government
of
her
household
we
will
now
give
a
few
specific
instructions
on
matters
having
a
more
practical
relation
to
the
position
which
she
is
supposed
to
occupy
in
the
eye
of
the
world
to
do
this
the
more
clearly
we
will
begin
with
her
earliest
duties
and
take
her
completely
through
the
occupations
of
a
day
having
risen
early
as
we
have
already
advised
and
having
given
due
attention
to
the
bath
and
made
a
careful
toilet
it
will
be
well
at
once
to
see
that
the
children
have
received
their
proper
ablutions
and
are
in
every
way
clean
and
comfortable
the
first
meal
of
the
day
breakfast
will
then
be
served
at
which
all
the
family
should
be
punctually
present
unless
illness
or
other
circumstances
prevent
after
breakfast
is
over
it
will
be
well
for
the
mistress
to
make
a
round
of
the
kitchen
and
other
offices
to
see
that
all
are
in
order
and
that
the
morning
work
has
been
properly
performed
by
the
various
domestics
the
orders
for
the
day
should
then
be
given
and
any
questions
which
the
domestics
desire
to
ask
respecting
their
several
departments
should
be
answered
and
any
special
articles
they
may
require
handed
to
them
from
the
in
those
establishments
where
there
is
a
housekeeper
it
will
not
be
so
necessary
for
the
mistress
personally
to
perform
the
duties
after
this
general
superintendence
of
her
servants
the
mistress
if
a
mother
of
a
young
family
may
devote
herself
to
the
instruction
of
some
of
its
younger
members
or
to
the
examination
of
the
state
of
their
wardrobe
leaving
the
later
portion
of
the
morning
for
reading
or
for
some
amusing
recreation
recreation
says
bishop
hall
is
intended
to
the
mind
as
whetting
is
to
the
scythe
to
sharpen
the
edge
of
it
which
would
otherwise
grow
dull
and
blunt
he
therefore
that
spends
his
whole
time
in
recreation
is
ever
whetting
never
mowing
his
grass
may
grow
and
his
steed
starve
as
contrarily
he
that
always
toils
and
never
recreates
is
ever
mowing
never
whetting
labouring
much
to
little
purpose
as
good
no
scythe
as
no
edge
then
only
doth
the
work
go
forward
when
the
scythe
is
so
seasonably
and
moderately
whetted
that
it
may
cut
and
so
cut
that
it
may
have
the
help
of
sharpening
unless
the
means
of
the
mistress
be
very
circumscribed
and
she
be
obliged
to
devote
a
great
deal
of
her
time
to
the
making
of
her
children
clothes
and
other
economical
pursuits
it
is
right
that
she
should
give
some
time
to
the
pleasures
of
literature
the
innocent
delights
of
the
garden
and
to
the
improvement
of
any
special
abilities
for
music
painting
and
other
elegant
arts
which
she
may
happily
possess
these
duties
and
pleasures
being
performed
and
enjoyed
the
hour
of
luncheon
will
have
arrived
this
is
a
very
necessary
meal
between
an
early
breakfast
and
a
late
dinner
as
a
healthy
person
with
good
exercise
should
have
a
fresh
supply
of
food
once
in
four
hours
it
should
be
a
light
meal
but
its
solidity
must
of
course
be
in
some
degree
proportionate
to
the
time
it
is
intended
to
enable
you
to
wait
for
your
dinner
and
the
amount
of
exercise
you
take
in
the
mean
time
at
this
time
also
the
servants
dinner
will
be
served
in
those
establishments
where
an
early
dinner
is
served
that
will
of
course
take
the
place
of
the
luncheon
in
many
houses
where
a
nursery
dinner
is
provided
for
the
children
and
about
one
the
mistress
and
the
elder
portion
of
the
family
make
their
luncheon
at
the
same
time
from
the
same
joint
or
whatever
may
be
provided
a
mistress
will
arrange
according
to
circumstances
the
serving
of
the
meal
but
the
more
usual
plan
is
for
the
lady
of
the
house
to
have
the
joint
brought
to
her
table
and
afterwards
carried
to
the
nursery
after
luncheon
morning
calls
and
visits
may
be
made
and
received
these
may
be
divided
under
three
heads
those
of
ceremony
friendship
and
congratulation
or
condolence
visits
of
ceremony
or
courtesy
which
occasionally
merge
into
those
of
friendship
are
to
be
paid
under
various
circumstances
thus
they
are
uniformly
required
after
dining
at
a
friend
house
or
after
a
ball
picnic
or
any
other
party
these
visits
should
be
short
a
stay
of
from
fifteen
to
twenty
minutes
being
quite
sufficient
a
lady
paying
a
visit
may
remove
her
boa
or
neckerchief
but
neither
her
shawl
nor
bonnet
when
other
visitors
are
announced
it
is
well
to
retire
as
soon
as
possible
taking
care
to
let
it
appear
that
their
arrival
is
not
the
cause
when
they
are
quietly
seated
and
the
bustle
of
their
entrance
is
over
rise
from
your
chair
taking
a
kind
leave
of
the
hostess
and
bowing
politely
to
the
guests
should
you
call
at
an
inconvenient
time
not
having
ascertained
the
luncheon
hour
or
from
any
other
inadvertence
retire
as
soon
as
possible
without
however
showing
that
you
feel
yourself
an
intruder
it
is
not
difficult
for
any
or
even
person
to
know
what
to
say
on
such
an
occasion
and
on
politely
withdrawing
a
promise
can
be
made
to
call
again
if
the
lady
you
have
called
on
appear
really
disappointed
in
paying
visits
of
friendship
it
will
not
be
so
necessary
to
be
guided
by
etiquette
as
in
paying
visits
of
ceremony
and
if
a
lady
be
pressed
by
her
friend
to
remove
her
shawl
and
bonnet
it
can
be
done
if
it
will
not
interfere
with
her
subsequent
arrangements
it
is
however
requisite
to
call
at
suitable
times
and
to
avoid
staying
too
long
if
your
friend
is
engaged
the
courtesies
of
society
should
ever
be
maintained
even
in
the
domestic
circle
and
amongst
the
nearest
friends
during
these
visits
the
manners
should
be
easy
and
cheerful
and
the
subjects
of
conversation
such
as
may
be
readily
terminated
serious
discussions
or
arguments
are
to
be
altogether
avoided
and
there
is
much
danger
and
impropriety
in
expressing
opinions
of
those
persons
and
characters
with
whom
perhaps
there
is
but
a
slight
acquaintance
and
it
is
not
advisable
at
any
time
to
take
favourite
dogs
into
another
lady
for
many
persons
have
an
absolute
dislike
to
such
animals
and
besides
this
there
is
always
a
chance
of
a
breakage
of
some
article
occurring
through
their
leaping
and
bounding
here
and
there
sometimes
very
much
to
the
fear
and
annoyance
of
the
hostess
her
children
also
unless
they
are
particularly
and
orderly
and
she
is
on
exceedingly
friendly
terms
with
the
hostess
should
not
accompany
a
lady
in
making
morning
calls
where
a
lady
however
pays
her
visits
in
a
carriage
the
children
can
be
taken
in
the
vehicle
and
remain
in
it
until
the
visit
is
over
for
morning
calls
it
is
well
to
be
neatly
attired
for
a
costume
very
different
to
that
you
generally
wear
or
anything
approaching
an
evening
dress
will
be
very
much
out
of
place
as
a
general
rule
it
may
be
said
both
in
reference
to
this
and
all
other
occasions
it
is
better
to
be
than
a
strict
account
should
be
kept
of
ceremonial
visits
and
notice
how
soon
your
visits
have
been
returned
an
opinion
may
thus
be
formed
as
to
whether
your
frequent
visits
are
or
are
not
desirable
there
are
naturally
instances
when
the
circumstances
of
old
age
or
ill
health
will
preclude
any
return
of
a
call
but
when
this
is
the
case
it
must
not
interrupt
the
discharge
of
the
duty
in
paying
visits
of
condolence
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
they
should
be
paid
within
a
week
after
the
event
which
occasions
them
if
the
acquaintance
however
is
but
slight
then
immediately
after
the
family
has
appeared
at
public
worship
a
lady
should
send
in
her
card
and
if
her
friends
be
able
to
receive
her
the
visitor
manner
and
conversation
should
be
subdued
and
in
harmony
with
the
character
of
her
visit
courtesy
would
dictate
that
a
mourning
card
should
be
used
and
that
visitors
in
paying
condoling
visits
should
be
dressed
in
black
either
silk
or
apparel
sympathy
with
the
affliction
of
the
family
is
thus
expressed
and
these
attentions
are
in
such
cases
pleasing
and
soothing
in
all
these
visits
if
your
acquaintance
or
friend
be
not
at
home
a
card
should
be
left
if
in
a
carriage
the
servant
will
answer
your
inquiry
and
receive
your
card
if
paying
your
visits
on
foot
give
your
card
to
the
servant
in
the
hall
but
leave
to
go
in
and
rest
should
on
no
account
be
asked
the
form
of
words
not
at
home
may
be
understood
in
different
senses
but
the
only
courteous
way
is
to
receive
them
as
being
perfectly
true
you
may
imagine
that
the
lady
of
the
house
is
really
at
home
and
that
she
would
make
an
exception
in
your
favour
or
you
may
think
that
your
acquaintance
is
not
desired
but
in
either
case
not
the
slightest
word
is
to
escape
you
which
would
suggest
on
your
part
such
an
impression
in
receiving
morning
calls
the
foregoing
description
of
the
etiquette
to
be
observed
in
paying
them
will
be
of
considerable
service
it
is
to
be
added
however
that
the
occupations
of
drawing
music
or
reading
should
be
suspended
on
the
entrance
of
morning
visitors
if
a
lady
however
be
engaged
with
light
needlework
and
none
other
is
appropriate
in
the
it
may
not
be
under
some
circumstances
inconsistent
with
good
breeding
to
quietly
continue
it
during
conversation
particularly
if
the
visit
be
protracted
or
the
visitors
be
gentlemen
formerly
the
custom
was
to
accompany
all
visitors
quitting
the
house
to
the
door
and
there
take
leave
of
them
but
modern
society
which
has
thrown
off
a
great
deal
of
this
kind
of
ceremony
now
merely
requires
that
the
lady
of
the
house
should
rise
from
her
seat
shake
hands
or
courtesy
in
accordance
with
the
intimacy
she
has
with
her
guests
and
ring
the
bell
to
summon
the
servant
to
attend
them
and
open
the
door
in
making
a
first
call
either
upon
a
couple
or
persons
newly
arrived
in
the
neighbourhood
a
lady
should
leave
her
card
together
with
her
own
at
the
same
time
stating
that
the
profession
or
business
in
which
he
is
engaged
has
prevented
him
from
having
the
pleasure
of
paying
the
visit
with
her
it
is
a
custom
with
many
ladies
when
on
the
eve
of
an
absence
from
their
neighbourhood
to
leave
or
send
their
own
and
cards
with
the
letters

these
letters
are
the
initials
of
the
french
words
prendre
meaning
to
take
leave
the
morning
calls
being
paid
or
received
and
their
etiquette
properly
attended
to
the
next
great
event
of
the
day
in
most
establishments
is
the
dinner
and
we
only
propose
here
to
make
a
few
general
remarks
on
this
important
topic
as
in
future
pages
the
whole
art
of
dining
will
be
thoroughly
considered
with
reference
to
its
economy
comfort
and
enjoyment
in
giving
or
accepting
an
invitation
for
dinner
the
following
is
the
form
of
words
generally
made
use
of
they
however
can
be
varied
in
proportion
to
the
intimacy
or
position
of
the
hosts
and
guests
and
a
present
their
compliments
to
and

and
request
the
honour
or
hope
to

the
pleasure
of
their
company
to

pleasure

b
square
cards
or
invitations
for
a
should
be
issued
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
sometimes
even
a
month
beforehand
and
care
should
be
taken
by
the
hostess
in
the
selection
of
the
invited
guests
that
they
should
be
suited
to
each
other
much
also
of
the
pleasure
of
a
will
depend
on
the
arrangement
of
the
guests
at
table
so
as
to
form
a
due
admixture
of
talkers
and
listeners
the
grave
and
the
gay
if
an
invitation
to
dinner
is
accepted
the
guests
should
be
punctual
and
the
mistress
ready
in
her
to
receive
them
at
some
periods
it
has
been
considered
fashionable
to
come
late
to
dinner
but
lately
avons
changé
tout
the
before
dinner
has
always
been
considered
as
the
great
ordeal
through
which
the
mistress
in
giving
a
will
either
pass
with
flying
colours
or
lose
many
of
her
laurels
the
anxiety
to
receive
her
guests
her
hope
that
all
will
be
present
in
due
time
her
trust
in
the
skill
of
her
cook
and
the
attention
of
the
other
domestics
all
tend
to
make
these
few
minutes
a
trying
time
the
mistress
however
must
display
no
kind
of
agitation
but
show
her
tact
in
suggesting
light
and
cheerful
subjects
of
conversation
which
will
be
much
aided
by
the
introduction
of
any
particular
new
book
curiosity
of
art
or
article
of
vertu
which
may
pleasantly
engage
the
attention
of
the
company
waiting
for
dinner
however
is
a
trying
time
and
there
are
few
who
have
not
felt
how
sad
it
is
to
sit
and
pine
the
long
before
we
dine
upon
our
watches
oft
to
look
then
wonder
at
the
clock
and
cook
and
strive
to
laugh
in
spite
of
fate
but
laughter
forced
soon
quits
the
room
and
leaves
it
in
its
former
gloom
but
lo
the
dinner
now
appears
the
object
of
our
hopes
and
fears
the
end
of
all
our
pain
in
giving
an
entertainment
of
this
kind
the
mistress
should
remember
that
it
is
her
duty
to
make
her
guests
feel
happy
comfortable
and
quite
at
their
ease
and
the
guests
should
also
consider
that
they
have
come
to
the
house
of
their
hostess
to
be
happy
thus
an
opportunity
is
given
to
all
for
innocent
enjoyment
and
intellectual
improvement
when
also
acquaintances
may
be
formed
that
may
prove
invaluable
through
life
and
information
gained
that
will
enlarge
the
mind
many
celebrated
men
and
women
have
been
great
talkers
and
amongst
others
the
genial
sir
walter
scott
who
spoke
freely
to
every
one
and
a
favourite
remark
of
whom
it
was
that
he
never
did
so
without
learning
something
he
did
know
before
dinner
being
announced
the
host
offers
his
arm
to
and
places
on
his
right
hand
at
the
the
lady
to
whom
he
desires
to
pay
most
respect
either
on
account
of
her
age
position
or
from
her
being
the
greatest
stranger
in
the
party
if
this
lady
be
married
and
her
husband
present
the
latter
takes
the
hostess
to
her
place
at
table
and
seats
himself
at
her
right
hand
the
rest
of
the
company
follow
in
couples
as
specified
by
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
arranging
the
party
according
to
their
rank
and
other
circumstances
which
may
be
known
to
the
host
and
hostess
it
will
be
found
of
great
assistance
to
the
placing
of
a
party
at
the
to
have
the
names
of
the
guests
neatly
and
correctly
written
on
small
cards
and
placed
at
that
part
of
the
table
where
it
is
desired
they
should
sit
with
respect
to
the
number
of
guests
it
has
often
been
said
that
a
private
should
consist
of
not
less
than
the
number
of
the
graces
or
more
than
that
of
the
muses
a
party
of
ten
or
twelve
is
perhaps
in
a
general
way
sufficient
to
enjoy
themselves
and
be
enjoyed
white
kid
gloves
are
worn
by
ladies
at
but
should
be
taken
off
before
the
business
of
dining
commences
the
guests
being
seated
at
the
the
lady
begins
to
help
the
soup
which
is
handed
round
commencing
with
the
gentleman
on
her
right
and
on
her
left
and
continuing
in
the
same
order
till
all
are
served
it
is
generally
established
as
a
rule
not
to
ask
for
soup
or
fish
twice
as
in
so
doing
part
of
the
company
may
be
kept
waiting
too
long
for
the
second
course
when
perhaps
a
little
revenge
is
taken
by
looking
at
the
awkward
consumer
of
a
second
portion
this
rule
however
may
under
various
circumstances
not
be
considered
as
binding
it
is
not
usual
where
taking
wine
is
for
a
gentleman
to
ask
a
lady
to
take
wine
until
the
fish
or
soup
is
finished
and
then
the
gentleman
honoured
by
sitting
on
the
right
of
the
hostess
may
politely
inquire
if
she
will
do
him
the
honour
of
taking
wine
with
him
this
will
act
as
a
signal
to
the
rest
of
the
company
the
gentleman
of
the
house
most
probably
requesting
the
same
pleasure
of
the
ladies
at
his
right
and
left
at
many
tables
however
the
custom
or
fashion
of
drinking
wine
in
this
manner
is
abolished
and
the
servant
fills
the
glasses
of
the
guests
with
the
various
wines
suited
to
the
course
which
is
in
progress
when
dinner
is
finished
the
dessert
is
placed
on
the
table
accompanied
with
it
is
the
custom
of
some
gentlemen
to
wet
a
corner
of
the
napkin
but
the
hostess
whose
behaviour
will
set
the
tone
to
all
the
ladies
present
will
merely
wet
the
tips
of
her
fingers
which
will
serve
all
the
purposes
required
the
french
and
other
continentals
have
a
habit
of
gargling
the
mouth
but
it
is
a
custom
which
no
english
gentlewoman
should
in
the
slightest
degree
imitate
when
fruit
has
been
taken
and
a
glass
or
two
of
wine
passed
round
the
time
will
have
arrived
when
the
hostess
will
rise
and
thus
give
the
signal
for
the
ladies
to
leave
the
gentlemen
and
retire
to
the
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
will
rise
at
the
same
time
and
he
who
is
nearest
the
door
will
open
it
for
the
ladies
all
remaining
courteously
standing
until
the
last
lady
has
withdrawn
johnson
has
a
curious
paragraph
on
the
effects
of
a
dinner
on
men
before
dinner
he
says
men
meet
with
great
inequality
of
understanding
and
those
who
are
conscious
of
their
inferiority
have
the
modesty
not
to
talk
when
they
have
drunk
wine
every
man
feels
himself
happy
and
loses
that
modesty
and
grows
impudent
and
vociferous
but
he
is
not
improved
he
is
only
not
sensible
of
his
defects
this
is
rather
severe
but
there
may
be
truth
in
it
in
former
times
when
the
bottle
circulated
freely
amongst
the
guests
it
was
necessary
for
the
ladies
to
retire
earlier
than
they
do
at
present
for
the
gentlemen
of
the
company
soon
became
unfit
to
conduct
themselves
with
that
decorum
which
is
essential
in
the
presence
of
ladies
thanks
however
to
the
improvements
in
modern
society
and
the
high
example
shown
to
the
nation
by
its
most
illustrious
personages
temperance
is
in
these
happy
days
a
striking
feature
in
the
character
of
a
gentleman
delicacy
of
conduct
towards
the
female
sex
has
increased
with
the
esteem
in
which
they
are
now
universally
held
and
thus
the
very
early
withdrawing
of
the
ladies
from
the
is
to
be
deprecated
a
lull
in
the
conversation
will
seasonably
indicate
the
moment
for
the
ladies
departure
invitations
may
be
given
by
which
we
wish
to
be
understood
invitations
for
the
evening
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
these
visitors
will
vary
according
to
their
engagements
or
sometimes
will
be
varied
in
obedience
to
the
caprices
of
fashion
guests
invited
for
the
evening
are
however
generally
considered
at
liberty
to
arrive
whenever
it
will
best
suit
themselves
usually
between
nine
and
twelve
unless
earlier
hours
are
specifically
named
by
this
arrangement
many
fashionable
people
and
others
who
have
numerous
engagements
to
fulfil
often
contrive
to
make
their
appearance
at
two
or
three
parties
in
the
course
of
one
evening
the
etiquette
of
the
table
being
disposed
of
let
us
now
enter
slightly
into
that
of
an
evening
party
or
ball
the
invitations
issued
and
accepted
for
either
of
these
will
be
written
in
the
same
style
as
those
already
described
for
a
they
should
be
sent
out
three
weeks
before
the
day
fixed
for
the
event
and
should
be
replied
to
within
a
week
of
their
receipt
by
attending
to
these
courtesies
the
guests
will
have
time
to
consider
their
engagements
and
prepare
their
dresses
and
the
hostess
will
also
know
what
will
be
the
number
of
her
party
if
the
entertainment
is
to
be
simply
an
evening
party
this
must
be
specified
on
the
card
or
note
of
invitation
short
or
verbal
invitations
except
where
persons
are
exceedingly
intimate
or
are
very
near
relations
are
very
far
from
proper
although
of
course
in
this
respect
and
in
many
other
respects
very
much
always
depends
on
the
manner
in
which
the
invitation
is
given
true
politeness
however
should
be
studied
even
amongst
the
nearest
friends
and
relations
for
the
mechanical
forms
of
good
breeding
are
of
great
consequence
and
too
much
familiarity
may
have
for
its
effect
the
destruction
of
friendship
as
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
arrive
each
should
be
shown
to
a
room
exclusively
provided
for
their
reception
and
in
that
set
apart
for
the
ladies
attendants
should
be
in
waiting
to
assist
in
uncloaking
and
helping
to
arrange
the
hair
and
toilet
of
those
who
require
it
it
will
be
found
convenient
in
those
cases
where
the
number
of
guests
is
large
to
provide
numbered
tickets
so
that
they
can
be
attached
to
the
cloaks
and
shawls
of
each
lady
a
duplicate
of
which
should
be
handed
to
the
guest
coffee
is
sometimes
provided
in
this
or
an
for
those
who
would
like
to
partake
of
it
as
the
visitors
are
announced
by
the
servant
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
lady
of
the
house
to
advance
each
time
towards
the
door
but
merely
to
rise
from
her
seat
to
receive
their
courtesies
and
congratulations
if
indeed
the
hostess
wishes
to
show
particular
favour
to
some
peculiarly
honoured
guests
she
may
introduce
them
to
others
whose
acquaintance
she
may
imagine
will
be
especially
suitable
and
agreeable
it
is
very
often
the
practice
of
the
master
of
the
house
to
introduce
one
gentleman
to
another
but
occasionally
the
lady
performs
this
office
when
it
will
of
course
be
polite
for
the
persons
thus
introduced
to
take
their
seats
together
for
the
time
being
the
custom
of
is
very
much
in
vogue
in
many
houses
and
guests
are
thus
left
to
discover
for
themselves
the
position
and
qualities
of
the
people
around
them
the
servant
indeed
calls
out
the
names
of
all
the
visitors
as
they
arrive
but
in
many
instances
mispronounces
them
so
that
it
will
not
be
well
to
follow
this
information
as
if
it
were
an
unerring
guide
in
our
opinion
it
is
a
cheerless
and
depressing
custom
although
in
thus
speaking
we
do
not
allude
to
the
large
assemblies
of
the
aristocracy
but
to
the
smaller
parties
of
the
middle
classes
a
separate
room
or
convenient
buffet
should
be
appropriated
for
refreshments
and
to
which
the
dancers
may
retire
and
cakes
and
biscuits
with
wine
negus
lemonade
and
ices
handed
round
a
supper
is
also
mostly
provided
at
the
private
parties
of
the
middle
classes
and
this
requires
on
the
part
of
the
hostess
a
great
deal
of
attention
and
supervision
it
usually
takes
place
between
the
first
and
second
parts
of
the
programme
of
the
dances
of
which
there
should
be
several
prettily
written
or
printed
copies
distributed
about
the
private
a
lady
is
not
to
refuse
the
invitation
of
a
gentleman
to
dance
unless
she
be
previously
engaged
the
hostess
must
be
supposed
to
have
asked
to
her
house
only
those
persons
whom
she
knows
to
be
perfectly
respectable
and
of
unblemished
character
as
well
as
pretty
equal
in
position
and
thus
to
decline
the
offer
of
any
gentleman
present
would
be
a
tacit
reflection
on
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
it
may
be
mentioned
here
more
especially
for
the
young
who
will
read
this
book
that
introductions
at
balls
or
evening
parties
cease
with
the
occasion
that
calls
them
forth
no
introduction
at
these
times
giving
a
gentleman
a
right
to
address
afterwards
a
lady
she
is
consequently
free
next
morning
to
pass
her
partner
at
a
ball
of
the
previous
evening
without
the
slightest
recognition
the
ball
is
generally
opened
that
is
the
first
place
in
the
first
quadrille
is
occupied
by
the
lady
of
the
house
when
anything
prevents
this
the
host
will
usually
lead
off
the
dance
with
the
lady
who
is
either
the
highest
in
rank
or
the
greatest
stranger
it
will
be
well
for
the
hostess
even
if
she
be
very
partial
to
the
amusement
and
a
graceful
dancer
not
to
participate
in
it
to
any
great
extent
lest
her
lady
guests
should
have
occasion
to
complain
of
her
monopoly
of
the
gentlemen
and
other
causes
of
neglect
a
few
dances
will
suffice
to
show
her
interest
in
the
entertainment
without
unduly
trenching
on
the
attention
due
to
her
guests
in
all
its
parts
a
ball
should
be
perfect
the
music
and
the
banquet
and
the
wine
the
garlands
the
and
the
flowers
the
hostess
or
host
during
the
progress
of
a
ball
will
courteously
accost
and
chat
with
their
friends
and
take
care
that
the
ladies
are
furnished
with
seats
and
that
those
who
wish
to
dance
are
provided
with
partners
a
gentle
hint
from
the
hostess
conveyed
in
a
quiet
ladylike
manner
that
certain
ladies
have
remained
unengaged
during
several
dances
is
sure
not
to
be
neglected
by
any
gentleman
thus
will
be
studied
the
comfort
and
enjoyment
of
the
guests
and
no
lady
in
leaving
the
house
will
be
able
to
feel
the
chagrin
and
disappointment
of
not
having
been
invited
to
stand
up
in
a
dance
during
the
whole
of
the
evening
when
any
of
the
carriages
of
the
guests
are
announced
or
the
time
for
their
departure
arrived
they
should
make
a
slight
intimation
to
the
hostess
without
however
exciting
any
observation
that
they
are
about
to
depart
if
this
can
not
be
done
however
without
creating
too
much
bustle
it
will
be
better
for
the
visitors
to
retire
quietly
without
taking
their
leave
during
the
course
of
the
week
the
hostess
will
expect
to
receive
from
every
guest
a
call
where
it
is
possible
or
cards
expressing
the
gratification
experienced
from
her
entertainment
this
attention
is
due
to
every
lady
for
the
pains
and
trouble
she
has
been
at
and
tends
to
promote
social
kindly
feelings
having
thus
discoursed
of
parties
of
pleasure
it
will
be
an
interesting
change
to
return
to
the
more
domestic
business
of
the
house
although
all
the
details
we
have
been
giving
of
balls
and
the
like
appertain
to
the
department
of
the
mistress
without
a
knowledge
of
the
etiquette
to
be
observed
on
these
occasions
a
mistress
would
be
unable
to
enjoy
and
appreciate
those
friendly
pleasant
meetings
which
give
as
it
were
a
fillip
to
life
and
make
the
quiet
happy
home
of
an
english
gentlewoman
appear
the
more
delightful
and
enjoyable
in
their
proper
places
all
that
is
necessary
to
be
known
respecting
the
dishes
and
appearance
of
the
breakfast
dinner
tea
and
supper
tables
will
be
set
forth
in
this
work
a
family
dinner
at
home
compared
with
either
giving
or
going
to
a
is
of
course
of
much
more
frequent
occurrence
and
many
will
say
of
much
greater
importance
both
however
have
to
be
considered
with
a
view
to
their
nicety
and
enjoyment
and
the
latter
more
particularly
with
reference
to
economy
these
points
will
be
especially
noted
in
the
following
pages
on
household
cookery
here
we
will
only
say
that
for
both
mistress
and
servants
as
well
in
large
as
small
households
it
will
be
found
by
far
the
better
plan
to
cook
and
serve
the
dinner
and
to
lay
the
tablecloth
and
the
sideboard
with
the
same
cleanliness
neatness
and
scrupulous
exactness
whether
it
be
for
the
mistress
herself
alone
a
small
family
or
for
company
if
this
rule
be
strictly
adhered
to
all
will
find
themselves
increase
in
managing
skill
whilst
a
knowledge
of
their
daily
duties
will
become
familiar
and
enable
them
to
meet
difficult
occasions
with
ease
and
overcome
any
amount
of
obstacles
of
the
manner
of
passing
evenings
at
home
there
is
none
pleasanter
than
in
such
recreative
enjoyments
as
those
which
relax
the
mind
from
its
severer
duties
whilst
they
stimulate
it
with
a
gentle
delight
where
there
are
young
people
forming
a
part
of
the
evening
circle
interesting
and
agreeable
pastime
should
especially
be
promoted
it
is
of
incalculable
benefit
to
them
that
their
homes
should
possess
all
the
attractions
of
healthful
amusement
comfort
and
happiness
for
if
they
do
not
find
pleasure
there
they
will
seek
it
elsewhere
it
ought
therefore
to
enter
into
the
domestic
policy
of
every
parent
to
make
her
children
feel
that
home
is
the
happiest
place
in
the
world
that
to
imbue
them
with
this
delicious
is
one
of
the
choicest
gifts
a
parent
can
bestow
light
or
fancy
needlework
often
forms
a
portion
of
the
recreation
for
the
ladies
of
the
household
and
this
may
be
varied
by
an
occasional
game
at
chess
or
backgammon
it
has
often
been
remarked
too
that
nothing
is
more
delightful
to
the
feminine
members
of
a
family
than
the
reading
aloud
of
some
good
standard
work
or
amusing
publication
a
knowledge
of
polite
literature
may
be
thus
obtained
by
the
whole
family
especially
if
the
reader
is
able
and
willing
to
explain
the
more
difficult
passages
of
the
book
and
expatiate
on
the
wisdom
and
beauties
it
may
contain
this
plan
in
a
great
measure
realizes
the
advice
of
lord
bacon
who
says
read
not
to
contradict
and
refute
nor
to
believe
and
take
for
granted
nor
to
find
talk
and
discourse
but
to
weigh
and
consider
in
retiring
for
the
night
it
is
well
to
remember
that
early
rising
is
almost
impossible
if
late
going
to
bed
be
the
order
or
rather
disorder
of
the
house
the
younger
members
of
a
family
should
go
early
and
at
regular
hours
to
their
beds
and
the
domestics
as
soon
as
possible
after
a
reasonably
appointed
hour
either
the
master
or
the
mistress
of
a
house
should
after
all
have
gone
to
their
separate
rooms
see
that
all
is
right
with
respect
to
the
lights
and
fires
below
and
no
servants
should
on
any
account
be
allowed
to
remain
up
after
the
heads
of
the
house
have
retired
having
thus
gone
from
early
rising
to
early
retiring
there
remain
only
now
to
be
considered
a
few
special
positions
respecting
which
the
mistress
of
the
house
will
be
glad
to
receive
some
specific
information
when
a
mistress
takes
a
house
in
a
new
locality
it
will
be
etiquette
for
her
to
wait
until
the
older
inhabitants
of
the
neighbourhood
call
upon
her
thus
evincing
a
desire
on
their
part
to
become
acquainted
with
the
new
comer
it
may
be
that
the
mistress
will
desire
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
but
few
of
her
neighbours
but
it
is
to
be
specially
borne
in
mind
that
all
visits
whether
of
ceremony
friendship
or
condolence
should
be
punctiliously
returned
you
may
perhaps
have
been
favoured
with
letters
of
introduction
from
some
of
your
friends
to
persons
living
in
the
neighbourhood
to
which
you
have
just
come
in
this
case
inclose
the
letter
of
introduction
in
an
envelope
with
your
card
then
if
the
person
to
whom
it
is
addressed
calls
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
the
visit
should
be
returned
by
you
within
the
week
if
possible
any
breach
of
etiquette
in
this
respect
will
not
readily
be
excused
in
the
event
of
your
being
invited
to
dinner
under
the
above
circumstances
nothing
but
necessity
should
prevent
you
from
accepting
the
invitation
if
however
there
is
some
distinct
reason
why
you
can
not
accept
let
it
be
stated
frankly
and
plainly
for
politeness
and
truthfulness
should
be
ever
allied
an
opportunity
should
also
be
taken
to
call
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
in
order
to
politely
express
your
regret
and
disappointment
at
not
having
been
able
to
avail
yourself
of
their
kindness
in
giving
a
letter
of
introduction
it
should
always
be
handed
to
your
friend
unsealed
courtesy
dictates
this
as
the
person
whom
you
are
introducing
would
perhaps
wish
to
know
in
what
manner
he
or
she
was
spoken
of
should
you
a
letter
from
a
friend
introducing
to
you
any
person
known
to
and
esteemed
by
the
writer
the
letter
should
be
immediately
acknowledged
and
your
willingness
expressed
to
do
all
in
your
power
to
carry
out
his
or
her
wishes
such
are
the
onerous
duties
which
enter
into
the
position
of
the
mistress
of
a
house
and
such
are
happily
with
a
slight
but
continued
attention
of
by
no
means
difficult
performance
she
ought
always
to
remember
that
she
is
the
first
and
the
last
the
alpha
and
the
omega
in
the
government
of
her
establishment
and
that
it
is
by
her
conduct
that
its
whole
internal
policy
is
regulated
she
is
therefore
a
person
of
far
more
importance
in
a
community
than
she
usually
thinks
she
is
on
her
pattern
her
daughters
model
themselves
by
her
counsels
they
are
directed
through
her
virtues
all
are
honoured
her
children
rise
up
and
call
her
blessed
her
husband
also
and
he
praiseth
her
therefore
let
each
mistress
always
remember
her
responsible
position
never
approving
a
mean
action
nor
speaking
an
unrefined
word
let
her
conduct
be
such
that
her
inferiors
may
respect
her
and
such
as
an
honourable
and
man
may
look
for
in
his
wife
and
the
mother
of
his
children
let
her
think
of
the
many
compliments
and
the
sincere
homage
that
have
been
paid
to
her
sex
by
the
greatest
philosophers
and
writers
both
in
ancient
and
modern
times
let
her
not
forget
that
she
has
to
show
herself
worthy
of
campbell
compliment
when
he
said
the
world
was
sad
the
garden
was
a
wild
and
man
the
hermit
sigh
till

let
her
prove

then
the
happy

of

and
able
to
take
unto
herself
the
praises
of
the
pious

cherishing
then
in

the
respected

of
the
good
and
the
great
let
the
mistress
of
every
house
rise
to
the
responsibility
of
its
management
so
that
in
doing
her
duty
to
all
around
her
she
may
receive
the
genuine
reward
of
respect
love
and
affection
many
mistresses
have
experienced
the
horrors
of
and
it
is
well
known
that
three
removes
are
as
good
or
bad
rather
as
a
fire
nevertheless
it
being
quite
evident
that
we
must
in
these
days
at
least
live
in
houses
and
are
sometimes
obliged
to
change
our
residences
it
is
well
to
consider
some
of
the
conditions
which
will
add
to
or
diminish
the
convenience
and
comfort
of
our
homes
although
the
choice
of
a
house
must
be
dependent
on
so
many
different
circumstances
with
different
people
that
to
give
any
specific
directions
on
this
head
would
be
impossible
and
useless
yet
it
will
be
advantageous
perhaps
to
many
if
we
point
out
some
of
those
general
features
as
to
locality
soil
aspect
to
which
the
attention
of
all
should
be
carefully
directed
regarding
the
locality
we
may
say
speaking
now
more
particularly
of
a
town
house
that
it
is
very
important
to
the
health
and
comfort
of
a
family
that
the
neighbourhood
of
all
factories
of
any
kind
producing
unwholesome
effluvia
or
smells
should
be
strictly
avoided
neither
is
it
well
to
take
a
house
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
where
a
noisy
trade
is
carried
on
as
it
is
unpleasant
to
the
feelings
and
tends
to
increase
any
existing
irritation
of
the
system
referring
to
soils
it
is
held
as
a
rule
that
a
gravel
soil
is
superior
to
any
other
as
the
rain
drains
through
it
very
quickly
and
it
is
consequently
drier
and
less
damp
than
clay
upon
which
water
rests
a
far
longer
time
a
clay
country
too
is
not
so
pleasant
for
walking
exercise
as
one
in
which
gravel
predominates
the
aspect
of
the
house
should
be
well
considered
and
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
more
sunlight
that
comes
into
the
house
the
healthier
is
the
habitation
the
close
fetid
smell
which
assails
one
on
entering
a
narrow
court
or
street
in
towns
is
to
be
assigned
to
the
want
of
light
and
consequently
air
a
house
with
a
south
or
aspect
is
lighter
warmer
drier
and
consequently
more
healthy
than
one
facing
the
north
or
great
advances
have
been
made
during
the
last
few
years
in
the
principles
of
sanitary
knowledge
and
one
most
essential
point
to
be
observed
in
reference
to
a
house
is
its
drainage
as
it
has
been
proved
in
an
endless
number
of
cases
that
bad
or
defective
drainage
is
as
certain
to
destroy
health
as
the
taking
of
poisons
this
arises
from
its
injuriously
affecting
the
atmosphere
thus
rendering
the
air
we
breathe
unwholesome
and
deleterious
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
then
that
unless
a
house
is
effectually
drained
the
health
of
its
inhabitants
is
sure
to
suffer
and
they
will
be
susceptible
of
ague
rheumatism
diarrhoea
fevers
and
cholera
we
now
come
to
an
point
that
of
the
water
supply
the
value
of
this
necessary
article
has
also
been
lately
more
and
more
recognized
in
connection
with
the
question
of
health
and
life
and
most
houses
are
well
supplied
with
every
convenience
connected
with
water
let
it
however
be
well
understood
that
no
house
however
suitable
in
other
respects
can
be
desirable
if
this
grand
means
of
health
and
comfort
is
in
the
slightest
degree
scarce
or
impure
no
caution
can
be
too
great
to
see
that
it
is
pure
and
good
as
well
as
plentiful
for
knowing
as
we
do
that
not
a
single
part
of
our
daily
food
is
prepared
without
it
the
importance
of
its
influence
on
the
health
of
the
inmates
of
a
house
can
not
be
ventilation
is
another
feature
which
must
not
be
overlooked
in
a
general
way
enough
of
air
is
admitted
by
the
cracks
round
the
doors
and
windows
but
if
this
be
not
the
case
the
chimney
will
smoke
and
other
plans
such
as
the
placing
of
a
plate
of
zinc
in
the
upper
part
of
the
window
must
be
used
cold
air
should
never
be
admitted
under
the
doors
or
at
the
bottom
of
a
room
unless
it
be
close
to
the
fire
or
stove
for
it
will
flow
along
the
floor
towards
the
fireplace
and
thus
leave
the
foul
air
in
the
upper
part
of
the
room
unpurified
cooling
at
the
same
time
unpleasantly
and
injuriously
the
feet
and
legs
of
the
inmates
the
rent
of
a
house
it
has
been
said
should
not
exceed
of
the
whole
income
of
its
occupier
and
as
a
general
rule
we
are
disposed
to
assent
to
this
estimate
although
there
may
be
many
circumstances
which
would
not
admit
of
its
being
considered
infallible
illustration
chapter
ii
the
housekeeper
as
second
in
command
in
the
house
except
in
large
establishments
where
there
is
a
house
steward
the
housekeeper
must
consider
herself
as
the
immediate
representative
of
her
mistress
and
bring
to
the
management
of
the
household
all
those
qualities
of
honesty
industry
and
vigilance
in
the
same
degree
as
if
she
were
at
the
head
of
her
family
constantly
on
the
watch
to
detect
any
on
the
part
of
any
of
the
domestics
she
will
overlook
all
that
goes
on
in
the
house
and
will
see
that
every
department
is
thoroughly
attended
to
and
that
the
servants
are
comfortable
at
the
same
time
that
their
various
duties
are
properly
performed
cleanliness
punctuality
order
and
method
are
essentials
in
the
character
of
a
good
housekeeper
without
the
first
no
household
can
be
said
to
be
well
managed
the
second
is
equally
for
those
who
are
under
the
housekeeper
will
take
their
cue
from
her
and
in
the
same
proportion
as
punctuality
governs
her
movements
so
will
it
theirs
order
again
is
indispensable
for
by
it
we
wish
to
be
understood
that
there
should
be
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
method
too
is
most
necessary
for
when
the
work
is
properly
contrived
and
each
part
arranged
in
regular
succession
it
will
be
done
more
quickly
and
more
effectually
a
necessary
qualification
for
a
housekeeper
is
that
she
should
thoroughly
understand
accounts
she
will
have
to
write
in
her
books
an
accurate
registry
of
all
sums
paid
for
any
and
every
purpose
all
the
current
expenses
of
the
house
tradesmen
bills
and
other
extraneous
matter
as
we
have
mentioned
under
the
head
of
the
mistress
a
housekeeper
accounts
should
be
periodically
balanced
and
examined
by
the
head
of
the
house
nothing
tends
more
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
employer
and
employed
than
this
arrangement
short
reckonings
make
long
friends
stands
good
in
this
case
as
in
others
it
will
be
found
an
excellent
plan
to
take
an
account
of
every
article
which
comes
into
the
house
connected
with
housekeeping
and
is
not
paid
for
at
the
time
the
book
containing
these
entries
can
then
be
compared
with
the
bills
sent
in
by
the
various
tradesmen
so
that
any
discrepancy
can
be
inquired
into
and
set
right
an
intelligent
housekeeper
will
by
this
means
too
be
better
able
to
judge
of
the
average
consumption
of
each
article
by
the
household
and
if
that
quantity
be
at
any
time
exceeded
the
cause
may
be
discovered
and
rectified
if
it
proceed
from
waste
or
carelessness
although
in
the
department
of
the
cook
the
housekeeper
does
not
generally
much
interfere
yet
it
is
necessary
that
she
should
possess
a
good
knowledge
of
the
culinary
art
as
in
many
instances
it
may
be
requisite
for
her
to
take
the
superintendence
of
the
kitchen
as
a
rule
it
may
be
stated
that
the
housekeeper
in
those
establishments
where
there
is
no
house
steward
or
man
cook
undertakes
the
preparation
of
the
confectionary
attends
to
the
preserving
and
pickling
of
fruits
and
vegetables
and
in
a
general
way
to
the
more
difficult
branches
of
the
art
of
cookery
much
of
these
arrangements
will
depend
however
on
the
qualifications
of
the
cook
for
instance
if
she
be
an
able
artiste
there
will
be
but
little
necessity
for
the
housekeeper
to
interfere
except
in
the
already
noticed
articles
of
confectionary
on
the
contrary
if
the
cook
be
not
so
clever
an
adept
in
her
art
then
it
will
be
requisite
for
the
housekeeper
to
give
more
of
her
attention
to
the
business
of
the
kitchen
than
in
the
former
case
it
will
be
one
of
the
duties
of
the
housekeeper
to
attend
to
the
marketing
in
the
absence
of
either
a
house
steward
or
man
cook
the
daily
duties
of
a
housekeeper
are
regulated
in
a
great
measure
by
the
extent
of
the
establishment
she
superintends
she
should
however
rise
early
and
see
that
all
the
domestics
are
duly
performing
their
work
and
that
everything
is
progressing
satisfactorily
for
the
preparation
of
the
breakfast
for
the
household
and
family
after
breakfast
which
in
large
establishments
she
will
take
in
the
housekeeper
room
with
the
butler
and
valet
and
where
they
will
be
waited
on
by
the
maid
she
will
on
various
days
set
apart
for
each
purpose
carefully
examine
the
household
linen
with
a
view
to
its
being
repaired
or
to
a
further
quantity
being
put
in
hand
to
be
made
she
will
also
see
that
the
furniture
throughout
the
house
is
well
rubbed
and
polished
and
will
besides
attend
to
all
the
necessary
details
of
marketing
and
ordering
goods
from
the
tradesmen
the
housekeeper
room
is
generally
made
use
of
by
the
butler
and
valet
who
take
there
their
breakfast
tea
and
supper
the
will
also
use
this
apartment
as
a
when
not
engaged
with
her
lady
or
with
some
other
duties
which
would
call
her
elsewhere
in
different
establishments
according
to
their
size
and
the
rank
of
the
family
different
rules
of
course
prevail
for
instance
in
the
mansions
of
those
of
very
high
rank
and
where
there
is
a
house
steward
there
are
two
distinct
tables
kept
one
in
the
steward
room
for
the
principal
members
of
the
household
the
other
in
the
servants
hall
for
the
other
domestics
at
the
steward
the
steward
and
housekeeper

of

in

of

and

there
are
some
establishments
however
in
which
distillation
is
still
carried
on
and
in
these
the
maid
has
her
old
duties
to
perform
in
a
general
way
however
this
domestic
is
immediately
concerned
with
the
housekeeper
for
the
latter
she
lights
the
fire
dusts
her
room
prepares
the
and
waits
at
the
different
meals
taken
in
the
housekeeper
room
a
maid
may
learn
a
very
great
deal
of
useful
knowledge
from
her
intimate
connection
with
the
housekeeper
and
if
she
be
active
and
intelligent
may
soon
fit
herself
for
a
better
position
in
the
household
in
the
evening
the
housekeeper
will
often
busy
herself
with
the
necessary
preparations
for
the
next
day
duties
numberless
small
but
still
important
arrangements
will
have
to
be
made
so
that
everything
may
move
smoothly
at
times
perhaps
attention
will
have
to
be
paid
to
the
breaking
of
the
stoning
of
raisins
the
washing
cleansing
and
drying
of
currants
the
evening
too
is
the
best
time
for
setting
right
her
account
of
the
expenditure
and
duly
writing
a
statement
of
moneys
received
and
paid
and
also
for
making
memoranda
of
any
articles
she
may
require
for
her
storeroom
or
other
departments
periodically
at
some
convenient
time
for
instance
quarterly
or
it
is
a
good
plan
for
the
housekeeper
to
make
an
inventory
of
everything
she
has
under
her
care
and
compare
this
with
the
lists
of
a
former
period
she
will
then
be
able
to
furnish
a
statement
if
necessary
of
the
articles
which
on
account
of
time
breakage
loss
or
other
causes
it
has
been
necessary
to
replace
or
replenish
in
concluding
these
remarks
on
the
duties
of
the
housekeeper
we
will
briefly
refer
to
the
very
great
responsibility
which
attaches
to
her
position
like
caesar
wife
she
should
be
above
suspicion
and
her
honesty
and
sobriety
unquestionable
for
there
are
many
temptations
to
which
she
is
exposed
in
a
physical
point
of
view
a
housekeeper
should
be
healthy
and
strong
and
be
particularly
clean
in
her
person
and
her
hands
although
they
may
show
a
degree
of
roughness
from
the
nature
of
some
of
her
employments
yet
should
have
a
nice
inviting
appearance
in
her
dealings
with
the
various
tradesmen
and
in
her
behaviour
to
the
domestics
under
her
the
demeanour
and
conduct
of
the
housekeeper
should
be
such
as
in
neither
case
to
diminish
by
an
undue
familiarity
her
authority
or
influence
it
will
be
useful
for
the
mistress
and
housekeeper
to
know
the
best
seasons
for
various
occupations
connected
with
household
management
and
we
accordingly
subjoin
a
few
hints
which
we
think
will
prove
valuable
as
in
the
winter
months
servants
have
much
more
to
do
in
consequence
of
the
necessity
there
is
to
attend
to
the
number
of
fires
throughout
the
household
not
much
more
than
the
ordinary
work
can
be
attempted
in
the
summer
and
when
the
absence
of
fires
gives
the
domestics
more
leisure
then
any
extra
work
that
is
required
can
be
more
easily
performed
the
spring
is
the
usual
period
set
apart
for
and
removing
all
the
dust
and
dirt
which
will
necessarily
with
the
best
of
housewives
accumulate
during
the
winter
months
from
the
smoke
of
the
coal
oil
gas
this
season
is
also
well
adapted
for
washing
and
bleaching
linen
as
the
weather
not
being
then
too
hot
for
the
exertions
necessary
in
washing
counterpanes
blankets
and
heavy
things
in
general
the
work
is
better
and
more
easily
done
than
in
the
intense
heats
of
july
which
month
some
recommend
for
these
purposes
winter
curtains
should
be
taken
down
and
replaced
by
the
summer
white
ones
and
furs
and
woollen
cloths
also
carefully
laid
by
the
former
should
be
well
shaken
and
brushed
and
then
pinned
upon
paper
or
linen
with
camphor
to
preserve
them
from
the
moths
furs
will
be
preserved
in
the
same
way
included
under
the
general
description
of

be

with
the
approaching

a
bright

and
a
new
face
in
unison
with
nature
oranges
now
should
be
preserved
and
orange
wine
made
the
summer
will
be
found
as
we
have
mentioned
above
in
consequence
of
the
diminution
of
labour
for
the
domestics
the
best
period
for
examining
and
repairing
household
linen
and
for
putting
to
rights
all
those
articles
which
have
received
a
large
share
of
wear
and
tear
during
the
dark
winter
days
in
direct
reference
to
this
matter
we
may
here
remark
that
sheets
should
be
turned
sides
to
middle
before
they
are
allowed
to
get
very
thin
otherwise
patching
which
is
uneconomical
from
the
time
it
consumes
and
is
unsightly
in
point
of
appearance
will
have
to
be
resorted
to
in
june
and
july
gooseberries
currants
raspberries
strawberries
and
other
summer
fruits
should
be
preserved
and
jams
and
jellies
made
in
july
too
the
making
of
walnut
ketchup
should
be
attended
to
as
the
green
walnuts
will
be
approaching
perfection
for
this
purpose
mixed
pickles
may
also
be
now
made
and
it
will
be
found
a
good
plan
to
have
ready
a
jar
of
for
the
making
of
which
all
information
will
be
given
in
future
pages
into
which
to
put
occasionally
some
young
french
beans
cauliflowers
in
the
early
autumn
plums
of
various
kinds
are
to
be
bottled
and
preserved
and
jams
and
jellies
made

little
later

a
most
useful
article

have

be
prepared

the

iii
arrangement
and
economy
of
the
kitchen
the
distribution
of
a
kitchen
says
count
rumford
the
celebrated
philosopher
and
physician
who
wrote
so
learnedly
on
all
subjects
connected
with
domestic
economy
and
architecture
must
always
depend
so
much
on
local
circumstances
that
general
rules
can
hardly
be
given
respecting
it
the
principles
however
on
which
this
distribution
ought
in
all
cases
to
be
made
are
simple
and
easy
to
be
understood
and
in
his
estimation
these
resolve
themselves
into
symmetry
of
proportion
in
the
building
and
convenience
to
the
cook
the
requisites
of
a
good
kitchen
however
demand
something
more
special
than
is
here
pointed
out
it
must
be
remembered
that
it
is
the
great
laboratory
of
every
household
and
that
much
of
the
weal
or
woe
as
far
as
regards
bodily
health
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
preparations
concocted
within
its
walls
a
good
kitchen
therefore
should
be
erected
with
a
view
to
the
following
particulars
convenience
of
distribution
in
its
parts
with
largeness
of
dimension
excellence
of
light
height
of
ceiling
and
good
ventilation
easiness
of
access
without
passing
through
the
house
sufficiently
remote
from
the
principal
apartments
of
the
house
that
the
members
visitors
or
guests
of
the
family
may
not
perceive
the
odour
incident
to
cooking
or
hear
the
noise
of
culinary
operations
plenty
of
fuel
and
water
which
with
the
scullery
pantry
and
storeroom
should
be
so
near
it
as
to
offer
the
smallest
possible
trouble
in
reaching
them
illustration
the
kitchens
of
the
middle
ages
in
england
are
said
to
have
been
constructed
after
the
fashion
of
those
of
the
romans
they
were
generally
octagonal
with
several
fireplaces
but
no
chimneys
neither
was
there
any
wood
admitted
into
the
building
the
accompanying
cut
fig
represents
the
turret
which
was
erected
on
the
top
of
the
conical
roof
of
the
kitchen
at
glastonbury
abbey
and
which
was
perforated
with
holes
to
allow
the
smoke
of
the
fire
as
well
as
the
steam
from
cooking
to
escape
some
kitchens
had
funnels
or
vents
below
the
eaves
to
let
out
the
steam
which
was
sometimes
considerable
as
the
used
their
meat
chiefly
in
a
boiled
state
from
this
circumstance
some
of
their
large
kitchens
had
four
ranges
comprising
a
for
small
boiled
meats
and
a
for
the
great
boiler
in
private
houses
the
culinary
arrangements
were
no
doubt
different
for
du
cange
mentions
a
little
kitchen
with
a
chamber
even
in
a
solarium
or
upper
floor
the
simplicity
of
the
primitive
ages
has
frequently
been
an
object
of
poetical
admiration
and
it
delights
the
imagination
to
picture
men
living
upon
such
fruits
as
spring
spontaneously
from
the
earth
and
desiring
no
other
beverages
to
slake
their
thirst
but
such
as
fountains
and
rivers
supply
thus
we
are
told
that
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
argos
lived
principally
on
pears
that
the
arcadians
revelled
in
acorns
and
the
athenians
in
figs
this
of
course
was
in
the
golden
age
before
ploughing
began
and
when
mankind
enjoyed
all
kinds
of
plenty
without
having
to
earn
their
bread
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
this
delightful
period
however
could
not
last
for
ever
and
the
earth
became
barren
and
continued
unfruitful
till
ceres
came
and
taught
the
art
of
sowing
with
several
other
useful
inventions
the
first
whom
she
taught
to
till
the
ground
was
triptolemus
who
communicated
his
instructions
to
his
countrymen
the
athenians
thence
the
art
was
carried
into
achaia
and
thence
into
arcadia
barley
was
the
first
grain
that
was
used
and
the
invention
of
is
ascribed
to
pan
the
use
of
fire
as
an
instrument
of
cookery
must
have
been
coeval
with
this
invention
of
bread
which
being
the
most
necessary
of
all
kinds
of
food
was
frequently
used
in
a
sense
so
comprehensive
as
to
include
both
meat
and
drink
it
was
by
the
greeks
baked
under
the
ashes
in
the
primary
ages
it
was
deemed
unlawful
to
eat
flesh
and
when
mankind
began
to
depart
from
their
primitive
habits
the
flesh
of
swine
was
the
first
that
was
eaten
for
several
ages
it
was
pronounced
unlawful
to
slaughter
oxen
from
an
estimate
of
their
great
value
in
assisting
men
to
cultivate
the
ground
nor
was
it
usual
to
kill
young
animals
from
a
sentiment
which
considered
it
cruel
to
take
away
the
life
of
those
that
had
scarcely
tasted
the
joys
of
existence
at
this
period
no
cooks
were
kept
and
we
know
from
homer
that
his
ancient
heroes
prepared
and
dressed
their
victuals
with
their
own
hands
ulysses
for
example
we
are
told
like
a
modern
charwoman
excelled
at
lighting
a
fire
whilst
achilles
was
an
adept
at
turning
a
spit
subsequently
heralds
employed
in
civil
and
military
affairs
filled
the
office
of
cooks
and
managed
marriage
feasts
but
this
no
doubt
was
after
mankind
had
advanced
in
the
art
of
living
a
step
further
than
which
in
all
places
was
the
ancient
manner
of
dressing
meat
the
age
of
roasting
we
may
consider
as
that
in
which
the
use
of
the
metals
would
be
introduced
as
adjuncts
to
the
culinary
art
and
amongst
these
iron
the
most
useful
of
them
all
would
necessarily
take
a
prominent
place
this
metal
is
easily
oxidized
but
to
bring
it
to
a
state
of
fusibility
it
requires
a
most
intense
heat
of
all
the
metals
it
is
the
widest
diffused
and
most
abundant
and
few
stones
or
mineral
bodies
are
without
an
admixture
of
it
it
possesses
the
valuable
property
of
being
welded
by
hammering
and
hence
its
adaptation
to
the
numerous
purposes
of
civilized
life
metallic
grains
of
iron
have
been
found
in
strawberries
and
a
twelfth
of
the
weight
of
the
wood
of
dried
oak

said
to
consist
of
this

its
colour

to
the
quantity
of

it
contains

our
knowledge
is
very
limited
but
as
the
art
of
living
in
every
civilized
country
is
pretty
much
the
same
the
instruments
for
cooking
must
in
a
great
degree
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
each
other

much
in
favour
with

brass
was
another
favourite

is
composed
of
copper

ancient

are
copied
from
those
found
amid
the

these
roman
cities
were
in
the
first
century
buried
beneath
the
lava
of
an
eruption
of
vesuvius
and
continued
to
be
lost
to
the
world
till
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
when
a
peasant
in
digging
for
a
well
gradually
discovered
a
small
temple
with
some
statues
little
notice
however
was
taken
of
this
circumstance
till
when
the
king
of
naples
desiring
to
erect
a
palace
at
portici
caused
extensive
excavations
to
be
made
when
the
city

slowly
unfolded

discovered
about

cleared

as
it
existed
immediately
before
the
catastrophe
which
overwhelmed
it
nearly
two
thousand
years
ago
it
presented
to
the
modern

the
perfect
picture
of
the
form
and
structure
of
an
ancient
roman
city
the
interior
of
its
habitations
shops
baths
theatres
and
temples
were
all
disclosed

of
the
implements
used
by
the
workmen
in
their
various
trades

the
materials
on
which
they
were
employed

the
doomed
city
was
covered

amongst
the
most
essential
requirements
of
the
kitchen

scales

for

use
these
are
found
to
have
existed
among
the
ancients
and
must
at
a
very
early
age
have
been
both
publicly
and
privately
employed
for
the
regulation
of
quantities
the
modern
english
weights
were
adjusted
by
the
chapter
of
magna
charta
or
the
great
charter
forced
by
the
barons
from
king
john
at
runnymede
in
surrey
therein
it
is
declared
that
the
weights
all
over
england
shall
be
the
same
although
for
different
commodities
there
were
two
different
kinds
troy
and
avoirdupois
the
origin
of
both
is
taken
from
a
grain
of
wheat
gathered
in
the
middle
of
an
ear
the
standard
of
measures
was
originally
kept
at
winchester

was
ordained
to
be

usually
composed
loses
its

when
exposed

but
undergoes
no
further

it
enters
largely
into

many
of
them
being
entirely
composed
of
tinned
the
inside
of
copper
and
iron
vessels
also
being
usually
what
is
called
this
art
consists
of
covering
any
metal
with
a
thin
coating
of
tin
and
it
requires
the
metal
to
be
covered
to
be
perfectly
clean
and
free
from
rust
and
also
that
the
tin

be
purely

after
they
are

by
being
first
made
hot

on
with
resin
in
this
process
nothing
ought
to
be
used
but
pure
lead
however
is
sometimes
mixed
with
that
metal
not
only
to
make
it
lie
more
easily
but
to
adulterate
it
a
pernicious
practice
which
in
every
article
connected
with
the
cooking
and
preparation
of
food
can
not
be
too
severely
the
following
list
supplied

show
the
articles
required
for
the
kitchen
of
a

although
it
does
not
contain
all
the
things
that
may
be
deemed
necessary
for
some
families
and
may
contain
more
than
are
required
for
others
as

however
publish
a
useful
illustrated
catalogue
which
may
be
had
at
their
establishment
and
which
it
will
be
found
advantageous
to
consult
by
those
about

the
necessity
of
our
enlarging

and
steamer
large
iron
stewpans
and
stand
dustpan
fish
and
gridiron
pair
of
bellows
wood
the
set
as
not
only
health
but
life
may
be
said
to
depend
on
the
cleanliness
of
culinary
utensils
great
attention
must
be
paid
to
their
condition
generally
but
more
especially
to
that
of
the
saucepans
stewpans
and
boilers
inside
they
should
be
kept
perfectly
clean
and
where
an
open
fire
is
used
the
outside
as
clean
as
possible
with
a
leamington
range
saucepans
stewpans
can
be
kept
entirely
free
from
smoke
and
soot
on
the
outside
which
is
an
immense
saving
of
labour
to
the
cook
or
care
should
be
taken
that
the
lids
fit
tight
and
close
so
that
soups
or
gravies
may
not
be
suffered
to
waste
by
evaporation
they
should
be
made
to
keep
the
steam
in
and
the
smoke
out
and
should
always
be
bright
on
the
upper
rim
where
they
do
not
immediately
come
in
contact
with
the
fire
and
kettles
should
be
washed
immediately
after
being
used
and
dried
before
the
fire
and
they
should
be
kept
in
a
dry
place
in
order
that
they
may
escape
the
deteriorating
influence
of
rust
and
thereby
be
destroyed
copper
utensils
should
never
be
used
in
the
kitchen
unless
tinned
and
the
utmost
care
should
be
taken
not
to
let
the
tin
be
rubbed
off
if
by
chance
this
should
occur
have
it
replaced
before
the
vessel
is
again
brought
into
use
neither
soup
nor
gravy
should
at
any
time
be
suffered
to
remain
in
them
longer
than
is
absolutely
necessary
as
any
fat
or
acid
that
is
in
them
may
affect
the
metal
so
as
to
impregnate
with
poison
what
is
intended
to
be
eaten
stone
and
earthenware
vessels
should
be
provided
for
soups
and
gravies
not
intended
for
immediate
use
and
also
plenty
of
common
dishes
for
the
larder
that
the
may
not
be
used
for
such
purposes
it
is
the
nature
of
vegetables
soon
to
turn
sour
when
they
are
apt
to
corrode
glazed
and
even
metals
and
frequently
thereby
to
become
impregnated
with
poisonous
particles
the
vinegar
also
in
pickles
by
its
acidity
does
the
same
consideration
therefore
should
be
given
to
these
facts
and
great
care
also
taken
that
all
and
tapes
for
collared
articles
be
well
scalded
and
kept
dry
or
they
will
impart
an
unpleasant
flavour
when
next
used
to
all
these
directions
the
cook
should
pay
great
attention
nor
should
they
by
any
means
be
neglected
by
the
of
the
who
ought
to
remember
that
cleanliness
in
the
kitchen
gives
health
and
happiness
to
home
whilst
economy
will
immeasurably
assist
in
preserving
them
without
fuel
a
kitchen
might
be
pronounced
to
be
of
little
use
therefore
to
discover
and
invent
materials
for
supplying
us
with
the
means
of
domestic
heat
and
comfort
has
exercised
the
ingenuity
of
man
those
now
known
have
been
divided
into
five
classes
the
first
comprehending
the
fluid
inflammable
bodies
the
second
peat
or
turf
the
third
charcoal
of
wood
the
fourth
charred
and
the
fifth
wood
or
in
a
crude
state
with
the
capacity
of
yielding
a
copious
and
bright
flame
the
first
may
be
said
seldom
to
be
employed
for
the
purposes
of
cookery
but
especially
amongst
rural
populations
has
in
all
ages
been
regarded
as
an
excellent
fuel
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
productions
of
an
alluvial
soil
and
belongs
to
the
vegetable
rather
than
the
mineral
kingdom
it
may
be
described
as
composed
of
wet
spongy
black
earth
held
together
by
decayed
vegetables
formerly
it
covered
extensive
tracts
in
england
but
has
greatly
disappeared
before
the
genius
of
agricultural
improvement
is
a
kind
of
artificial
coal
used
principally
where
a
strong
and
clear
fire
is
desired
it
is
a
black
brittle
insoluble
inodorous
tasteless
substance
and
when
possesses
the
remarkable
property
of
absorbing
certain
quantities
of
the
different
gases
its
dust
when
used
as
a
polishing
powder
gives
great
brilliancy
to
metals
it
consists
of
wood
and
is
manufactured
by
cutting
pieces
of
timber
into
nearly
the
same
size
then
disposing
them
in
heaps
and
covering
them
with
earth
so
as
to
prevent
communication
with
the
air
except
when
necessary
to
make
them
burn
when
they
have
been
sufficiently
charred
the
fire
is
extinguished
by
stopping
the
vents
through
which
the
air
is
admitted
of
there
are
various
species
as
pit
culm
slate
cannel
kilkenny
sulphurous
bovey
jet
these
have
all
their
specific
differences
and
are
employed
for
various
purposes
but
are
all
more
or
less
used
as
fuel
the
use
of
coal
for
burning
purposes
was
not
known
to
the
romans
in
britain
it
was
discovered
about
fifty
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
in
lancashire
not
tar
from
where
manchester
now
stands
but
for
ages
after
its
discovery
so
long
as
forests
abounded
wood
continued
to
be
the
fuel
used
for
firing
the
first
public
notice
of
coal
is
in
the
reign
of
henry
who
in
granted
a
charter
to
the
town
of
newcastle
permitting
the
inhabitants
to
dig
for
coal
it
took
some
centuries
more
however
to
bring
it
into
common
use
as
this
did
not
take
place
till
about
the
first
quarter
of
the
seventeenth
century
in
the
time
of
charles
i
a
few
years
after
the
restoration
we
find
that
about
chaldrons
were
consumed
in
london
although
several
countries
possess
mines
of
coal
the
quality
of
their
mineral
is
in
general
greatly
inferior
to
that
of
great
britain
where
it
is
found
mostly
in
undulating
districts
abounding
with
valleys
and
interspersed
with
plains
of
considerable
extent
it
lies
usually
between
the
of
other
substances
and
rarely
in
an
horizontal
position
but
with
a
or
inclination
to
one
side

cut

a
section
of
coal

it
is

consideration
is
how

latter
may

preserved
with
a
view
to
its
being
suitably
dressed
more
waste
is
often
occasioned
by
the
want
of
judgment
or
of
necessary
care
in
this
particular
than
by
any
other
cause
in
the
absence
of
proper
places
for
keeping
provisions
a
hanging
safe
suspended
in
an
airy
situation
is
the
best
substitute
a
larder
dry
and
shady
is
better
for
meat
and
poultry
which
require
to
be
kept
for
some
time
and
the
utmost
skill
in
the
culinary
art
will
not
compensate
for
the
want
of
proper
attention
to
this
particular
though
it
is
advisable
that
annual
food
should
be
hung
up
in
the
open
air
till
its
fibres
have
lost
some
degree
of
their
toughness
yet
if
it
is
kept
till
it
loses
its
natural
sweetness
its
flavour
has
become
deteriorated
and
as
a
wholesome
comestible
it
has
lost
many
of
its
qualities
conducive
to
health
as
soon
therefore
as
the
slightest
trace
of
putrescence
is
detected
it
has
reached
its
highest
degree
of
tenderness
and
should
be
dressed
immediately
during
the
sultry
summer
months
it
is
difficult
to
procure
meat
that
is
not
either
tough
or
tainted
it
should
therefore
be
well
examined
when
it
comes
in
and
if
flies
have
touched
it
the
part
must
be
cut
off
and
the
remainder
well
washed
in
very
cold
weather
meat
and
vegetables
touched
by
the
frost
should
be
brought
into
the
kitchen
early
in
the
morning
and
soaked
in
cold
water
in
loins
of
meat
the
long
pipe
that
runs
by
the
bone
should
be
taken
out
as
it
is
apt
to
taint
as
also
the
kernels
of
beef
rumps
and
edgebones
of
beef
when
bruised
should
not
be
purchased
all
these
things
ought
to
enter
into
the
consideration
of
every
household
manager
and
great
care
should
be
taken
that
nothing
is
thrown
away
or
suffered
to
be
wasted
in
the
kitchen
which
might
by
proper
management
be
turned
to
a
good
account
the
of
mutton
so
little
esteemed
in
general
give
richness
to
soups
or
gravies
if
well
soaked
and
brushed
before
they
are
added
to
the
boiling
they
are
also
particularly
nourishing
for
sick
persons
bones
or
of
ham
make
excellent
stock
for
when
the
whites
of
eggs
are
used
for
jelly
confectionary
or
other
purposes
a
pudding
or
a
custard
should
be
made
that
the
yolks
may
be
used
all
things
likely
to
be
wanted
should
be
in

sugars
of
different

washed
picked

perfectly
dry
spices
pounded
and
kept
in

small
bottles
closely
corked

already
directed
not
more
of

should
be
purchased
at
a
time
than
are
likely
to
be
used
in
the
course
of
a
month
much
waste
is
always
prevented
by
keeping
every
article
in
the
place
best
suited
to
it
vegetables
keep
best
on
a
stone
floor
if
the
air
be
excluded
meat
in
a
cold
dry
place
as
also
salt
sugar
candles
dried
meats
and
hams
rice
and
all
sorts
of
seed
for
puddings
should
be
closely
covered
to
preserve
them
from
insects
but
even
this
will
not
prevent
them
from
being
affected
by
these
destroyers
if
they
are
long
and

chapter
iv
introduction
to
cookery
as
in
the
fine
arts
the
progress
of
mankind
from
barbarism
to
civilization
is
marked
by
a
gradual
succession
of
triumphs
over
the
rude
materialities
of
nature
so
in
the
art
of
cookery
is
the
progress
gradual
from
the
earliest
and
simplest
modes
to
those
of
the
most
complicated
and
refined
plain
or
stones
tumuli
or
mounds
of
earth
are
the
monuments
by
which
barbarous
tribes
denote
the
events
of
their
history
to
be
succeeded
only
in
the
long
course
of
a
series
of
ages
by
columns
statues
triumphal
arches
coins
medals
and
the
higher
efforts
of
the
pencil
and
the
pen
as
man
advances
by
culture
and
observation
to
the
perfection
of
his
facilities
so
is
it
with
the
art
of
cookery
man
in
his
primitive
state
lives
upon
roots
and
the
fruits
of
the
earth
until
by
degrees
he
is
driven
to
seek
for
new
means
by
which
his
wants
may
be
supplied
and
enlarged
he
then
becomes
a
hunter
and
a
fisher
as
his
species
increases
greater
necessities
come
upon
him
when
he
gradually
abandons
the
roving
life
of
the
savage
for
the
more
stationary
pursuits
of
the
herdsman
these
beget
still
more
settled
habits
when
he
begins
the
practice
of
agriculture
forms
ideas
of
the
rights
of
property
and
has
his
own
both
defined
and
secured
the
forest
the
stream
and
the
sea
are
now
no
longer
his
only
resources
for
food
he
sows
and
he
reaps
pastures
and
breeds
cattle
lives
on
the
cultivated
produce
of
his
fields
and
revels
in
the
luxuries
of
the
dairy
raises
flocks
for
clothing
and
assumes
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
habits
of
permanent
life
and
the
comfortable
condition
of
a
farmer
this
is
the
fourth
stage
of
social
progress
up
to
which
the
useful
or
mechanical
arts
have
been
incidentally
developing
themselves
when
trade
and
commerce
begin
through
these
various
phases
to
has
been
the
great
object
of
mankind
but
comforts
are
multiplied
and
accumulating
riches
create
new
wants
the
object
then
is
not
only
to
but
to
live
economically
agreeably
tastefully
and
well
accordingly
the
art
of
cookery
commences
and
although
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
fowls
of
the
air
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fish
of
the
sea
are
still
the
only
food
of
mankind
yet
these
are
so
prepared
improved
and
dressed
by
skill
and
ingenuity
that
they
are
the
means
of
immeasurably
extending
the
boundaries
of
human
enjoyments
everything
that
is
edible
and
passes
under
the
hands
of
the
cook
is
more
or
less
changed
and
assumes
new
forms
hence
the
influence
of
that
functionary
is
immense
upon
the
happiness
of
a
household
in
order
that
the
duties
of
the
cook
may
be
properly
performed
and
that
he
may
be
able
to
reproduce
esteemed
dishes
with
certainty
all
terms
of
indecision
should
be
banished
from
his
art
accordingly
what
is
known
only
to
him
will
in
these
pages
be
made
known
to
others
in
them
all
those
indecisive
terms
expressed
by
a
bit
of
this
some
of
that
a
small
piece
of
that
and
a
handful
of
the
other
shall
never
be
made
use
of
but
all
quantities
be
precisely
and
explicitly
stated
with
a
desire
also
that
all
ignorance
on
this
most
essential
part
of
the
culinary
art
should
disappear
and
that
a
uniform
system
of
weights
and
measures
should
be
adopted
we
give
an
account
of
the
weights
which
answer
to
certain
measures
a
is
frequently
mentioned
in
a
recipe
in
the
prescriptions
of
medical
men
and
also
in
medical
chemical
and
gastronomical
works
by
it
is
generally
meant
and
understood
a
measure
or
bulk
equal
to
that
which
would
be
produced
by

measure
or
bulk
equal
to

a

equal
in
quantity
to
a
of
water
a
this
is
the
name
of
a
vague
kind
of
measure
and
is
so
called
on
account
of
the
liquid
being
from
the
mouth
of
a
bottle
its
quantity
however
will
vary
either
from
the
consistency
of
the
liquid
or
the
size
and
shape
of
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
the
college
of
physicians
determined
the
quantity
of
a
drop
to
be
drops
making
one
fluid
drachm
their
drop
or
sixtieth
part
of
a
fluid
drachm
is
called

measures
can
be
obtained
at
any
chemist
and
they
save

trouble
one
of
these
containing
a

into
and
the
oz
into
drachms
of

by
which
any
certain
weight
mentioned
in
a
recipe
can
be
accurately
measured
out
measures
of
this
kind
can
readily
be
formed
by
weighing
the
water
contained
in
any
given
measure
and
marking
on
any

this
mark

made
with

it
will
be
interesting
to
many
readers
to
know
the
basis
on
which
the
french
found
their
system
of
weights
and
measures
for
it
certainly
possesses
the
grandeur
of
simplicity
the
metre
which
is
the
basis
of
the
whole
system
of
french
weights
and
measures
is
the
exact
measurement
of
one
part
of
a
meridian
of
the
earth
excellence
in
the
art
of
cookery
as
in
all
other
things
is
only
attainable
by
practice
and
experience
in
proportion
therefore
to
the
opportunities
which
a
cook
has
had
of
these
so
will
be
his
excellence
in
the
art
it
is
in
the
large
establishments
of
princes
noblemen
and
very
affluent
families
alone
that
the
man
cook
is
found
in
this
country
he
also
superintends
the
kitchens
of
large
hotels
clubs
and
public
institutions
where
he
usually
makes
out
the
bills
of
fare
which
are
generally
submitted
to
the
principal
for
approval
to
be
able
to
do
this
therefore
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
be
a
judge
of
the
season
of
every
dish
as
well
as
know
perfectly
the
state
of
every
article
he
undertakes
to
prepare
he
must
also
be
a
judge
of
every
article
he
buys
for
no
skill
however
great
it
may
be
will
enable
him
to
make
that
good
which
is
really
bad
on
him
rests
the
responsibility
of
the
cooking
generally
whilst
a
speciality
of
his
department
is
to
prepare
the
rich
soups
stews
ragouts
and
such
dishes
as
enter
into
the
more
refined
and
complicated
portions
of
his
art
and
such
as
are
not
usually
understood
by
ordinary
professors
he
therefore
holds
a
high
position
in
a
household
being
inferior
in
rank
as
already
shown
only
to
the
house
steward
the
valet
and
the
butler
in
the
luxurious
ages
of
grecian
antiquity
sicilian
cooks
were
the
most
esteemed
and
received
high
rewards
for
their
services
among
them
one
called
trimalcio
was
such
an
adept
in
his
art
that
he
could
impart
to

both
the

the

sank
into

in

laboured
to
acquire

of
the
cook
the
kitchen
and
the
scullery
maids
are
so
intimately
associated
that
they
can
hardly
be
treated
of
separately
the
cook
however
is
at
the
head
of
the
kitchen
and
in
proportion
to
her
possession
of
the
qualities
of
cleanliness
neatness
order
regularity
and
celerity
of
action
so
will
her
influence
appear
in
the
conduct
of
those
who
are
under
her
as
it
is
upon
her
that
the
whole
responsibility
of
the
business
of
the
kitchen
rests
whilst
the
others
must
lend
her
both
a
ready
and
a
willing
assistance
and
be
especially
tidy
in
their
appearance
and
active
in
their
movements
in
the
larger
establishments
of
the
middle
ages
cooks
with
the
authority
of
feudal
chiefs
gave
their
orders
from
a
high
chair
in
which
they
ensconced
themselves
and
commanded
a
view
of
all
that
was
going
on
throughout
their
several
domains
each
held
a
long
wooden
spoon
with
which
he
tasted
without
leaving
his
seat
the
various
comestibles
that
were
cooking
on
the
stoves
and
which
he
frequently
used
as
a
rod
of
punishment
on
the
backs
of
those
whose
idleness
and
gluttony
too
largely
predominated
over
their
diligence
and
temperance
if
as
we
have
said
the
quality
of
early
rising
be
of
the
first
importance
to
the
mistress
what
must
it
be
to
the
servant
let
it
therefore
be
taken
as
a
truism
that
without
it
in
every
domestic
the
effect
of
all
things
else
so
far
as
is
concerned
may
in
a
great
measure
be
neutralized
in
a
cook
this
quality
is
most
essential
for
an
hour
lost
in
the
morning
will
keep
her
toiling
absolutely
toiling
all
day
to
overtake
that
which
might
otherwise
have
been
achieved
with
ease
in
large
establishments
six
is
a
good
hour
to
rise
in
the
summer
and
seven
in
the
winter
her
first
duty
in
large
establishments
and
where
it
is
requisite
should
be
to
set
her
dough
for
the
breakfast
rolls
provided
this
has
not
been
done
on
the
previous
night
and
then
to
engage
herself
with
those
numerous
little
preliminary
occupations
which
may
not
inappropriately
be
termed
laying
out
her
duties
for
the
day
this
will
bring
in
the
breakfast
hour
of
eight
after
which
directions
must
be
given
and
preparations
made
for
the
different
dinners
of
the
household
and
family
in
those
numerous
households
where
a
cook
and
housemaid
are
only
kept
the
general
custom
is
that
the
cook
should
have
the
charge
of
the
the
hall
the
lamps
and
the
doorstep
are
also
committed
to
her
care
and
any
other
work
there
may
be
on
the
outside
of
the
house
in
establishments
of
this
kind
the
cook
will
after
having
lighted
her
kitchen
fire
carefully
brushed
the
range
and
cleaned
the
hearth
proceed
to
prepare
for
breakfast
she
will
thoroughly
rinse
the
kettle
and
filling
it
with
fresh
water
will
put
it
on
the
fire
to
boil
she
will
then
go
to
the
or
parlour
and
there
make
all
things
ready
for
the
breakfast
of
the
family
her
attention
will
next
be
directed
to
the
hall
which
she
will
sweep
and
wipe
the
kitchen
stairs
if
there
be
any
will
now
be
swept
and
the
hall
mats
which
have
been
removed
and
shaken
will
be
again
put
in
their
places
the
cleaning
of
the
kitchen
pantry
passages
and
kitchen
stairs
must
always
be
over
before
breakfast
so
that
it
may
not
interfere
with
the
other
business
of
the
day
everything
should
be
ready
and
the
whole
house
should
wear
a
comfortable
aspect
when
the
heads
of
the
house
and
members
of
the
family
make
their
appearance
nothing
it
may
be
depended
on
will
so
please
the
mistress
of
an
establishment
as
to
notice
that
although
she
has
not
been
present
to
see
that
the
work
was
done
attention
to
smaller
matters
has
been
carefully
paid
with
a
view
to
giving
her
satisfaction
and
increasing
her
comfort
by
the
time
that
the
cook
has
performed
the
duties
mentioned
above
and
well
swept
brushed
and
dusted
her
kitchen
the
will
most
likely
summon
her
to
the
parlour
to
bring
in
the
breakfast
it
is
the
cook
department
generally
in
the
smaller
establishments
to
wait
at
breakfast
as
the
housemaid
by
this
time
has
gone
into
the
bedrooms
and
has
there
applied
herself
to
her
various
duties
the
cook
usually
answers
the
bells
and
single
knocks
at
the
door
in
the
early
part
of
the
morning
as
the
tradesmen
with
whom
it
is
her
more
special
business
to
speak
call
at
these
hours
it
is
in
her
preparation
of
the
dinner
that
the
cook
begins
to
feel
the
weight
and
responsibility
of
her
situation
as
she
must
take
upon
herself
all
the
dressing
and
the
serving
of
the
principal
dishes
which
her
skill
and
ingenuity
have
mostly
prepared
whilst
these
however
are
cooking
she
must
be
busy
with
her
pastry
soups
gravies
ragouts
stock
or
what
the
french
call
being
the
basis
of
most
made
dishes
must
be
always
at
hand
in
conjunction
with
her
sweet
herbs
and
spices
for
seasoning
a
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
must
be
her
rule
in
order
that
time
may
not
be
wasted
in
looking
for
things
when
they
are
wanted
and
in
order
that
the
whole
apparatus
of
cooking
may
move
with
the
regularity
and
precision
of
a
machine
all
must
go
on
simultaneously
the
vegetables
and
sauces
must
be
ready
with
the
dishes
they
are
to
accompany
and
in
order
that
they
may
be
suitable
the
smallest
oversight
must
not
be
made
in
their
preparation
when
the
has
arrived
it
is
the
duty
of
the
cook
to
such
dishes
as
may
without
injury
stand
for
some
time
covered
on
the
hot
plate
or
in
the
hot
closet
but
such
as
are
of
a
more
important
or
kind
must
be
delayed
until
the
order
to
serve
is
given
from
the
then
comes
haste
but
there
must
be
no
hurry
all
must
work
with
order
the
cook
takes
charge
of
the
fish
soups
and
poultry
and
the
of
the
vegetables
sauces
and
gravies
these
she
puts
into
their
appropriate
dishes
whilst
the
waits
on
and
assists
the
cook
everything
must
be
timed
so
as
to
prevent
its
getting
cold
whilst
great
care
should
be
taken
that
between
the
first
and
second
courses
no
more
time
is
allowed
to
elapse
than
is
necessary
for
fear
that
the
company
in
the
lose
all
relish
for
what
has
yet
to
come
of
the
dinner
when
the
dinner
has
been
served
the
most
important
feature
in
the
daily
life
of
the
cook
is
at
an
end
she
must
however
now
begin
to
look
to
the
contents
of
her
larder
taking
care
to
keep
everything
sweet
and
clean
so
that
no
disagreeable
smells
may
arise
from
the
gravies
milk
or
meat
that
may
be
there
these
are
the
principal
duties
of
a
cook
in
a
establishment
in
smaller
establishments
the
housekeeper
often
conducts
the
higher
department
of
cooking
and
the
cook
with
the
assistance
of
a
performs
some
of
the
subordinate
duties
of
the
when
circumstances
render
it
necessary
the
cook
engages
to
perform
the
whole
of
the
work
of
the
kitchen
and
in
some
places
a
portion
of
the
also
whilst
the
cook
is
engaged
with
her
morning
duties
the
is
also
occupied
with
hers
her
first
duty
after
the
fire
is
lighted
is
to
sweep
and
clean
the
kitchen
and
the
various
offices
belonging
to
it
this
she
does
every
morning
besides
cleaning
the
stone
steps
at
the
entrance
of
the
house
the
halls
the
passages
and
the
stairs
which
lead
to
the
kitchen
her
general
duties
besides
these
are
to
wash
and
scour
all
these
places
twice
a
week
with
the
tables
shelves
and
cupboards
she
has
also
to
dress
the
nursery
and
dinners
to
prepare
all
fish
poultry
and
vegetables
trim
meat
joints
and
cutlets
and
do
all
such
duties
as
may
be
considered
to
enter
into
the
cook
department
in
a
subordinate
degree
the
duties
of
the
are
to
assist
the
cook
to
keep
the
scullery
clean
and
all
the
metallic
as
well
as
earthenware
kitchen
utensils
the
position
of
is
not
of
course
one
of
high
rank
nor
is
the
payment
for
her
services
large
but
if
she
be
fortunate
enough
to
have
over
her
a
good
and
clever
cook
she
may
very
soon
learn
to
perform
various
little
duties
connected
with
cooking
operations
which
may
be
of
considerable
service
in
fitting
her
for
a
more
responsible
place
now
it
will
be
doubtless
thought
by
the
majority
of
our
readers
that
the
fascinations
connected
with
the
position
of
the
are
not
so
great
as
to
induce
many
people
to
leave
a
comfortable
home
in
order
to
work
in
a
scullery
but
we
are
acquainted
with
one
instance
in
which
the
desire
on
the
part
of
a
young
girl
was
so
strong
to
become
connected
with
the
kitchen
and
cookery
that
she
absolutely
left
her
parents
and
engaged
herself
as
a
in
a
gentleman
house
here
she
showed
herself
so
active
and
intelligent
that
she
very
quickly
rose
to
the
rank
of
and
from
this
so
great
was
her
gastronomical
genius
she
became
in
a
short
space
of
time
one
of
the
best
in
england
after
this
we
think
it
must
be
allowed
that
a
cook
like
a
poet
non
modern
cookery
stands
so
greatly
indebted
to
the
gastronomic
propensities
of
our
french
neighbours
that
many
of
their
terms
are
adopted
and
applied
by
english
artists
to
the
same
as
well
as
similar
preparations
of
their
own
a
vocabulary
of
these
is
therefore
indispensable
in
a
work
of
this
kind

following

be
found

complete

ordinary

form
an
agreeable
whole
to
accomplish
this
care
must
be
taken
that
the
roots
and
herbs
are
perfectly
well
cleaned
and
that
the
water
is
proportioned
to
the
quantity
of
meat
and
other
ingredients
generally
a
quart
of
water
may
be
allowed
to
a
pound
of
meat
for
soups
and
half
the
quantity
for
gravies
in
making
soups
or
gravies
gentle
stewing
or
simmering
is
incomparably
the
best
it
may
be
remarked
however
that
a
really
good
soup
can
never
be
made
but
in
a
vessel
although
perhaps
greater
wholesomeness
is
obtained
by
an
occasional
exposure
to
the
air
soups
will
in
general
take
from
three
to
six
hours
doing
and
are
much
better
prepared
the
day
before
they
are
wanted
when
the
soup
is
cold
the
fat
may
be
much
more
easily
and
completely
removed
and
when
it
is
poured
off
care
must
be
taken
not
to
disturb
the
settlings
at
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
which
are
so
fine
that
they
will
escape
through
a
sieve
a
tamis
is
the
best
strainer
and
if
the
soup
is
strained
while
it
is
hot
let
the
tamis
or
cloth
be
previously
soaked
in
cold
water
clear

be
perfectly
transparent

with
a
bit
of

and
rubbed
through

and
gradually
incorporated
with
the
soup
will
be
found
an
excellent
addition
when
the
soup
appears
to
be
or
the
cover
of
the
boiler
should
be
taken
off
and
the
contents
allowed
to
boil
till
some
of
the
watery
parts
have
evaporated
or
some
of
the
thickening
materials
above
mentioned
should
be
added
when
soups

gravies
are
kept
from

various

excellent
to
heighten
the

be
its

the
latter
though
equally
strong
does
not
impart
the
delicate
sweetness
of
the

when
used

soups
which
are
intended
to
constitute
the
principal
part
of
a
meal
certainly
ought
not
to
be
flavoured
like
sauces
which
are
only
designed
to
give
a
relish
to
some
particular
dish
soup
broth
and
bouillon
it
has
been
asserted
that
english
cookery
is
nationally
speaking
far
from
being
the
best
in
the
world
more
than
this
we
have
been
frequently
told
by
brilliant
foreign
writers
half
philosophers
half
that
we
are
the
cooks
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
that
the
proverb
which
alludes
to
the
divine
origin
of
food
and
the
precisely
opposite
origin
of
its
preparers
is
peculiarly
applicable
to
us
islanders
not
however
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
whole
island
for
it
is
stated
in
a
work
which
treats
of
culinary
operations
north
of
the
tweed
that
the
broth
of
scotland
claims
for
excellence
and
wholesomeness
a
very
close
second
place
to
the
or
common
soup
of
france
hot
meals
of
broth
and
meat
for
about
the
price
of
one
roasting
joint
our
scottish
brothers
and
sisters
get
they
say
and
we
hasten
to
assent
to
what
we
think
is
now
a
very
fact
we
are
glad
to
note
however
that
soups
of
vegetables
fish
meat
and
game
are
now
very
frequently
found
in
the
homes
of
the
english
middle
classes
as
well
as
in
the
mansions
of
the
wealthier
and
more
aristocratic
and
we
take
this
to
be
one
evidence
that
we
are
on
the
right
road
to
an
improvement
in
our
system
of
cookery
one
great
cause
of
many
of
the
spoilt
dishes
and
meats
which
are
brought
to
our
tables
arises
we
think
and
most
will
agree
with
us
from
a
with
common
things
entertaining
this
view
we
intend
to
preface
the
chapters
of
this
work
with
a
simple
scientific
of
all
those
causes
and
circumstances
which
relate
to
the
food
we
have
to
prepare
and
the
theory
and
chemistry
of
the
various
culinary
operations
accordingly
this
is
the
proper
place
to
treat
of
the
quality
of
the
flesh
of
animals
and
describe
some
of
the
circumstances
which
influence
it
for
good
or
bad
we
will
therefore
commence
with
the
circumstance
of
and
examine
how
far
this
affects
the
quality
of
meat
during
the
period
between
the
birth
and
maturity
of
animals
their
flesh
undergoes
very
considerable
changes
for
instance
when
the
animal
is
young
the
fluids
which
the
tissues
of
the
muscles
contain
possess
a
large
proportion
of
what
is
called
this
albumen
which
is
also
the
chief
component
of
the
white
of
eggs
possesses
the
peculiarity
of
coagulating
or
hardening
at
a
certain
temperature
like
the
white
of
a
boiled
egg
into
a
soft
white
fluid
no
longer
soluble
or
capable
of
being
dissolved
in
water
as
animals
grow
older
this
peculiar
animal
matter
gradually
decreases
in
proportion
to
the
other
constituents
of
the
juice
of
the
flesh
thus
the
reason
why
veal
lamb
and
young
pork
are
and
without
when
cooked
is
that
the
large
quantity
of
albumen
they
contain
hardens
or
becomes
coagulated
on
the
other
hand
the
reason
why
beef
and
mutton
are
and
have
is
that
the
proportion
of
albumen
they
contain
is
small
in
comparison
with
their
greater
quantity
of
fluid
which
is
soluble
and
not
coagulable
the
quality
of
the
flesh
of
an
animal
is
considerably
influenced
by
the
nature
of
the
on
which
it
has
been
for
the
food
supplies
the
material
which
produces
the
flesh
if
the
food
be
not
suitable
and
good
the
meat
can
not
be
good
either
just
as
the
paper
on
which
these
words
are
printed
could
not
be
good
if
the
rags
from
which
it
is
made
were
not
of
a
fine
quality
to
the
experienced
in
this
matter
it
is
well
known
that
the
flesh
of
animals
fed
on
farinaceous
produce
such
as
corn
pulse
is
firm
and
also
economical
in
the
cooking
that
the
flesh
of
those
fed
on
succulent
and
pulpy
substances
such
as
roots
possesses
these
qualities
in
a
somewhat
less
degree
whilst
the
flesh
of
those
whose
food
contains
fixed
oil
as
linseed
is
greasy
high
coloured
and
gross
in
the
fat
and
if
the
food
has
been
used
in
large
quantities
possessed
of
a
rank
flavour
it
is
indispensable
to
the
good
quality
of
meat
that
the
animal
should
be
at
the
time
of
its
slaughter
however
slight
the
disease
in
an
animal
may
be
inferiority
in
the
quality
of
its
flesh
as
food
is
certain
to
be
produced
in
most
cases
indeed
as
the
flesh
of
diseased
animals
has
a
tendency
to
very
rapid
putrefaction
it
becomes
not
only
unwholesome
but
absolutely
poisonous
on
account
of
the
absorption
of
the
of
the
unsound
meat
into
the
systems
of
those
who
partake
of
it
the
external
indications
of
good
and
bad
meat
will
be
described
under
its
own
particular
head
but
we
may
here
premise
that
the
layer
of
all
wholesome
meat
when
freshly
killed
adheres
firmly
to
the
bone
another
circumstance
greatly
affecting
the
quality
of
meat
is
the
animal
treatment
it
is
this
influences
its
value
and
wholesomeness
in
no
inconsiderable
degree
it
will
be
easy
to
understand
this
when
we
reflect
on
those
leading
principles
by
which
the
life
of
an
animal
is
supported
and
maintained
these
are
the
digestion
of
its
food
and
the
assimilation
of
that
food
into
its
substance
nature
in
effecting
this
process
first
reduces
the
food
in
the
stomach
to
a
state
of
pulp
under
the
name
of
chyme
which
passes
into
the
intestines
and
is
there
divided
into
two
principles
each
distinct
from
the
other
one
a
fluid
the
nutritive
portion
is
absorbed
by
innumerable
vessels
which
open
upon
the
mucous
membrane
or
inner
coat
of
the
intestines
these
vessels
or
absorbents
discharge
the
fluid
into
a
common
duct
or
road
along
which
it
is
conveyed
to
the
large
veins
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
heart
here
it
is
mixed
with
the
venous
blood
which
is
black
and
impure
returning
from
every
part
of
the
body
and
then
it
supplies
the
waste
which
is
occasioned
in
the
circulating
stream
by
the
arterial
or
pure
blood
having
furnished
matter
for
the
substance
of
the
animal
the
blood
of
the
animal
having
completed
its
course
through
all
parts
and
having
had
its
waste
recruited
by
the
digested
food
is
now
received
into
the
heart
and
by
the
action
of
that
organ
it
is
urged
through
the
lungs
there
to
receive
its
purification
from
the
air
which
the
animal
inhales
again
returning
to
the
heart
it
is
forced
through
the
arteries
and
thence
distributed
by
innumerable
ramifications
called
capillaries
bestowing
to
every
part
of
the
animal
life
and
nutriment
the
other
principle
the
innutritive
portion
passes
from
the
intestines
and
is
thus
got
rid
of
it
will
now
be
readily
understood
how
flesh
is
affected
for
bad
if
an
animal
is
slaughtered
when
the
circulation
of
its
blood
has
been
increased
by
or
other
causes
of
excitement
to
such
a
degree
of
rapidity
as
to
be
too
great
for
the
capillaries
to
perform
their
functions
and
causing
the
blood
to
be
congealed
in
its
minuter
vessels
where
this
has
been
the
case
the
meat
will
be
and
become
rapidly
putrid
so
that
and
humanity
alike
dictate
kind
and
gentle
treatment
of
all
animals
destined
to
serve
as
food
for
man
the
chemistry
and
economy
of
stock
being
the
basis
of
all
meat
soups
and
also
of
all
the
principal
sauces
it
is
essential
to
the
success
of
these
culinary
operations
to
know
the
most
complete
and
economical
method
of
extracting
from
a
certain
quantity
of
meat
the
best
possible
stock
or
broth
the
theory
and
philosophy
of
this
process
we
will
therefore
explain
and
then
proceed
to
show
the
practical
course
to
be
adopted
as
all
meat
is
principally
composed
of
fibres
fat
gelatine
osmazome
and
albumen
it
is
requisite
to
know
that
the
fibres
are
inseparable
constituting
almost
all
that
remains
of
the
meat
after
it
has
undergone
a
long
boiling
fat
is
dissolved
by
boiling
but
as
it
is
contained
in
cells
covered
by
a
very
fine
membrane
which
never
dissolves
a
portion
of
it
always
adheres
to
the
fibres
the
other
portion
rises
to
the
surface
of
the
stock
and
is
that
which
has
escaped
from
the
cells
which
were
not
whole
or
which
have
burst
by
boiling
gelatine
is
soluble
it
is
the
basis
and
the
nutritious
portion
of
the
stock
when
there
is
an
abundance
of
it
it
causes
the
stock
when
cold
to
become
a
jelly
osmazome
is
soluble
even
when
cold
and
is
that
part
of
the
meat
which
gives
flavour
and
perfume
to
the
stock
the
flesh
of
old
animals
contains
more
than
that
of
young
ones
brown
meats
contain
more
than
white
and
the
former
make
the
stock
more
fragrant
by
roasting
meat
the
osmazome
appears
to
acquire
higher
properties
so
by
putting
the
remains
of
roast
meats
into
your
you
obtain
a
better
flavour
albumen
is
of
the
nature
of
the
white
of
eggs
it
can
be
dissolved
in
cold
or
tepid
water
but
coagulates
when
it
is
put
into
water
not
quite
at
the
from
this
property
in
albumen
it
is
evident
that
if
the
meat
is
put
into
the
when
the
water
boils
or
after
this
is
made
to
boil
up
quickly
the
albumen
in
both
cases
hardens
in
the
first
it
rises
to
the
surface
in
the
second
it
remains
in
the
meat
but
in
both
it
prevents
the
gelatine
and
osmazome
from
dissolving
and
hence
a
thin
and
tasteless
stock
will
be
obtained
it
ought
to
be
known
too
that
the
coagulation
of
the
albumen
in
the
meat
always
takes
place
more
or
less
according
to
the
size
of
the
piece
as
the
parts
farthest
from
the
surface
always
acquire
of
heat
which
congeals
it
before
entirely
dissolving
it
bones
ought
always
to
form
a
component
part
of
the
they
are
composed
of
an
earthy
substance
to
which
they
owe
their
solidity
of
gelatine
and
a
fatty
fluid
something
like
marrow
of
them
contain
as
much
gelatine
as
of
meat
but
in
them
this
is
so
incased
in
the
earthy
substance
that
boiling
water
can
dissolve
only
the
surface
of
whole
bones
by
breaking
them
however
you
can
dissolve
more
because
you
multiply
their
surfaces
and
by
reducing
them
to
powder
or
paste
you
can
dissolve
them
entirely
but
you
must
not
grind
them
dry
we
have
said
that
gelatine
forms
the
basis
of
stock
but
this
though
very
nourishing
is
entirely
without
taste
and
to
make
the
stock
savoury
it
must
contain
of
this
bones
do
not
contain
a
particle
and
that
is
the
reason
why
stock
made
entirely
of
them
is
not
liked
but
when
you
add
meat
to
the
broken
or
pulverized
bones
the
osmazome
contained
in
it
makes
the
stock
sufficiently
savoury
in
concluding
this
part
of
our
subject
the
following
condensed
hints
and
directions
should
be
attended
to
in
the
economy
of
i
beef
makes
the
best
stock
veal
stock
has
less
colour
and
taste
whilst
mutton
sometimes
gives
it
a
tallowy
smell
far
from
agreeable
unless
the
meat
has
been
previously
roasted
or
broiled
fowls
add
very
little
to
the
flavour
of
stock
unless
they
be
old
and
fat
pigeons
when
they
are
old
add
the
most
flavour
to
it
and
a
rabbit
or
partridge
is
also
a
great
improvement
from
the
freshest
meat
the
best
stock
is
obtained
ii
if
the
meat
be
boiled
solely
to
make
stock
it
must
be
cut
up
into
the
smallest
possible
pieces
but
generally
speaking
if
it
is
desired
to
have
good
stock
and
a
piece
of
savoury
meat
as
well
it
is
necessary
to
put
a
rather
large
piece
into
the
say
sufficient
for
two
or
three
days
during
which
time
the
stock
will
keep
well
in
all
weathers
choose
the
freshest
meat
and
have
it
cut
as
thick
as
possible
for
if
it
is
a
thin
flat
piece
it
will
not
look
well
and
will
be
very
soon
spoiled
by
the
boiling
iii
never
wash
meat
as
it
deprives
its
surface
of
all
its
juices
separate
it
from
the
bones
and
tie
it
round
with
tape
so
that
its
shape
may
be
preserved
then
put
it
into
the
and
for
each
pound
of
meat
let
there
be
one
pint
of
water
press
it
down
with
the
hand
to
allow
the
air
which
it
contains
to
escape
and
which
often
raises
it
to
the
top
of
the
water
iv
put
the
on
a
gentle
fire
so
that
it
may
heat
gradually
the
albumen
will
first
dissolve
afterwards
coagulate
and
as
it
is
in
this
state
lighter
than
the
liquid
it
will
rise
to
the
surface
bringing
with
it
all
its
impurities
it
is
this
which
makes
the
rising
of
the
hardened
albumen
has
the
same
effect
in
clarifying
stock
as
the
white
of
eggs
and
as
a
rule
it
may
be
said
that
the
more
scum
there
is
the
clearer
will
be
the
stock
always
take
care
that
the
fire
is
very
regular
remove
the
scum
when
it
rises
thickly
and
do
not
let
the
stock
boil
because
then
one
portion
of
the
scum
will
be
dissolved
and
the
other
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
pot
thus
rendering
it
very
difficult
to
obtain
a
clear
broth
if
the
fire
is
regular
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
add
cold
water
in
order
to
make
the
scum
rise
but
if
the
fire
is
too
large
at
first
it
will
then
be
necessary
to
do
so
vi
when
the
stock
is
well
skimmed
and
begins
to
boil
put
in
salt
and
vegetables
which
may
be
two
or
three
carrots
two
turnips
one
parsnip
a
bunch
of
leeks
and
celery
tied
together
you
can
add
according
to
taste
a
piece
of
cabbage
two
or
three
cloves
stuck
in
an
onion
and
a
tomato
the
latter
gives
a
very
agreeable
flavour
to
the
stock
if
fried
onion
be
added
it
ought
according
to
the
advice
of
a
famous
french
to
be
tied
in
a
little
bag
without
this
precaution
the
colour
of
the
stock
is
liable
to
be
clouded
vii
by
this
time
we
will
now
suppose
that
you
have
chopped
the
bones
which
were
separated
from
the
meat
and
those
which
were
left
from
the
roast
meat
of
the
day
before
remember
as
was
before
pointed
out
that
the
more
these
are
broken
the
more
gelatine
you
will
have
the
best
way
to
break
them
up
is
to
pound
them
roughly
in
an
iron
mortar
adding
from
time
to
time
a
little
water
to
prevent
them
getting
heated
it
is
a
great
saving
thus
to
make
use
of
the
bones
of
meat
which
in
too
many
english
families
we
fear
are
entirely
wasted
for
it
is
certain
as
previously
stated
no
that
two
ounces
of
bone
contain
as
much
gelatine
which
is
the
nutritive
portion
of
stock
as
one
pound
of
meat
in
their
broken
state
tie
them
up
in
a
bag
and
put
them
in
the
adding
the
gristly
parts
of
cold
meat
and
trimmings
which
can
be
used
for
no
other
purpose
if
to
make
up
the
weight
you
have
received
from
the
butcher
a
piece
of
mutton
or
veal
broil
it
slightly
over
a
clear
fire
before
putting
it
in
the
and
be
very
careful
that
it
does
not
contract
the
least
taste
of
being
smoked
or
burnt
viii
add
now
the
vegetables
which
to
a
certain
extent
will
stop
the
boiling
of
the
stock
wait
therefore
till
it
simmers
well
up
again
then
draw
it
to
the
side
of
the
fire
and
keep
it
gently
simmering
till
it
is
served
preserving
as
before
said
your
fire
always
the
same
cover
the
well
to
prevent
evaporation
do
not
fill
it
up
even
if
you
take
out
a
little
stock
unless
the
meat
is
exposed
in
which
case
a
little
boiling
water
may
be
added
but
only
enough
to
cover
it
after
six
hours
slow
and
gentle
simmering
the
stock
is
done
and
it
should
not
be
continued
on
the
fire
longer
than
is
necessary
or
it
will
tend
to
insipidity
it
is
on
a
good
stock
or
first
good
broth
and
sauce
that
excellence
in
cookery
depends
if
the
preparation
of
this
basis
of
the
culinary
art
is
intrusted
to
negligent
or
ignorant
persons
and
the
stock
is
not
well
skimmed
but
indifferent
results
will
be
obtained
the
stock
will
never
be
clear
and
when
it
is
obliged
to
be
clarified
it
is
deteriorated
both
in
quality
and
flavour
in
the
proper
management
of
the
an
immense
deal
of
trouble
is
saved
inasmuch
as
one
stock
in
a
small
dinner
serves
for
all
purposes
above
all
things
the
greatest
economy
consistent
with
excellence
should
be
practised
and
the
price
of
everything
which
enters
the
kitchen
correctly
ascertained
the
of
this
part
of
household
management
may
appear
trifling
but
its
practice
is
extensive
and
therefore
it
requires

attention

quern
or
the
origin
of
bread
is
involved
in
the
obscurity
of
distant
ages
the
greeks
attributed
its
invention
to
pan
but
before
they
themselves
had
an
existence
it
was
no
doubt
in
use
among
the
primitive
nations
of
mankind
the
chaldeans
and
the
egyptians
were
acquainted
with
it
and
sarah
the
companion
of
abraham
mixed
flour
and
water
together
kneaded
it
and
covered
it
with
ashes
on
the
hearth
the
scriptures
inform
us
that
leavened
bread
was
known
to
the
israelites
but
it
is
not
known
when
the
art
of
fermenting
it
was
discovered
it
is
said
that
the
romans
learnt
it
during
their
wars
with
perseus
king
of
macedon
and
that
it
was
introduced
to
the
imperial
city
about
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
with
them
it
no
doubt
found
its
way
into
britain
but
after
their
departure
from
the
island
it
probably
ceased
to
be
used
we
know
that
king
alfred
allowed
the
unfermented
cakes
to
burn
in
the
cottage
and
that
even
in
the
sixteenth
century
unfermented
cakes
kneaded
by
the
women
were
the
only
kind
of
bread
known
to
the
inhabitants
of
norway
and
sweden
the
italians
of
this
day
consume
the
greater
portion
of
their
flour
in
the
form
of
or
soft
pudding
vermicelli
and
macaroni
and
in
the
remoter
districts
of
scotland
much
unfermented
bread
is
still
used
we
give
a
cut
of
the
which
towards
the
end
of
the
last
century
was
in
use
in
that
country
and
which
is
thus
described
by
johnson
in
his
journey
to
the
hebrides
it
consists
of
two
stones
about

the

the
gray
or
field
pea
called
by
the
french
is
less
subject
to
run
into
varieties
than
the
garden
kinds
and
is
considered
by
some
perhaps
on
that
account
to
be
the
wild
plant
retaining
still
a
large
proportion
of
its
original
habit
from
the
tendency
of
all
other
varieties
to
run

what

it

was
well

was

there
are
some
varieties

peas
which
have
no
lining

they
are
called

the
best
variety
is
the

the

was
used
in

of
by
the

who
made
each

in

copper

gallons
of
this
soup
for
distribution
amongst
about
a
dozen
families
of
the
village
near
which
she
lives
the
cost
as
will
be
seen
was
not
great
but
she
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
soup
was
very
much
liked
and
gave
to
the
members
of
those
families
a
dish
of
warm
comforting
food
in

hare
the
common
this
little
animal
is
found
throughout
europe
and
indeed
in
most
of
the
northern
parts
of
the
world
and
as
it
is
destitute
of
natural
weapons
of
defence
providence
has
endowed
it
with
an
extraordinary
amount
of
the
passion
of
fear
as
if
to
awaken
the
vigilance
of
this
passion
too
he
has
furnished
it
with
long
and
tubular
ears
in
order
that
it
may
catch
the
remotest
sounds
and
with
full
prominent
eyes
which
enable
it
to
see
at
one
and
the

time
both
before
and
behind
it
the
hare
feeds
in
the
evenings
and
sleeps
in
its
form

the
day

as
it
generally
lies
on
the
ground
its
feet
both
below

ventured
a

further

you
mean

you
can
not
put
the

for
many
reasons
first
it
will
be
long
in
cooling
secondly
when
you
take
some
out
it
will
break
all
the
rest
into
rags
if
you
warm
in
a
the
turtle
will
always
retain
the
same
taste
but
if
you
boil
it
often
it
becomes
strong
and
loses
the
delicacy
of
its
flavour

the
natural
history
of
fishes
in
natural
history
fishes
form
the
fourth
class
in
the
system
of
linnaeus
and
are
described
as
having
long
eggs
without
white
organs
of
sense
fins
for
supporters
bodies
covered
with
concave
scales
gills
to
supply
the
place
of
lungs
for
respiration
and
water
for
the
natural
element
of
their
existence
had
mankind
no
other
knowledge
of
animals
than
of
such
as
inhabit
the
land
and
breathe
their
own
atmosphere
they
would
listen
with
incredulous
wonder
if
told
that
there
were
other
kinds
of
beings
which
existed
only
in
the
waters
and
which
would
die
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
taken
from
them
however
strongly
these
facts
might
be
attested
they
would
hardly
believe
them
without
the
operation
of
their
own
senses
as
they
would
recollect
the
effect
produced
on
their
own
bodies
when
immersed
in
water
and
the
impossibility
of
their
sustaining
life
in
it
for
any
lengthened
period
of
time
experience
however
has
taught
them
that
the
great
deep
is
crowded
with
inhabitants
of
various
sizes
and
of
vastly
different
constructions
with
modes
of
life
entirely
distinct
from
those
which
belong
to
the
animals
of
the
land
and
with
peculiarities
of
design
equally
wonderful
with
those
of
any
other
works
which
have
come
from
the
hand
of
the
creator
the
history
of
these
races
however
must
remain
for
ever
more
or
less
in
a
state
of
darkness
since
the
depths
in
which
they
live
are
beyond
the
power
of
human
exploration
and
since
the
illimitable
expansion
of
their
domain
places
them
almost
entirely
out
of
the
reach
of
human
accessibility
in
studying
the
conformation
of
fishes
we
naturally
conclude
that
they
are
in
every
respect
well
adapted
to
the
element
in
which
they
have
their
existence
their
shape
has
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
lower
part
of
a
ship
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
form
of
the
fish
originally
suggested
the
form
of
the
ship
the
body
is
in
general
slender
gradually
diminishing
towards
each
of
its
extremities
and
flattened
on
each
of
its
sides
this
is
precisely
the
form
of
the
lower
part
of
the
hull
of
a
ship
and
it
enables
both
the
animal
and
the
vessel
with
comparative
ease
to
penetrate
and
divide
the
resisting
medium
for
which
they
have
been
adapted
the
velocity
of
a
ship
however
in
sailing
before
the
wind
is
by
no
means
to
be
compared
to
that
of
a
fish
it
is
well
known
that
the
largest
fishes
will
with
the
greatest
ease
overtake
a
ship
in
full
sail
play
round
it
without
effort
and
shoot
ahead
of
it
at
pleasure
this
arises
from
their
great
flexibility
which
to
compete
with
mocks
the
labours
of
art
and
enables
them
to
migrate
thousands
of
miles
in
a
season
without
the
slightest
indications
of
languor
or
fatigue
the
principal
instruments
employed
by
fishes
to
accelerate
their
motion
are
their
fins
and
tail
by
means
of
the
they
enlarge
or
diminish
the
specific
gravity
of
their
bodies
when
they
wish
to
sink
they
compress
the
muscles
of
the
abdomen
and
eject
the
air
contained
in
it
by
which
their
weight
compared
with
that
of
the
water
is
increased
and
they
consequently
descend
on
the
other
hand
when
they
wish
to
rise
they
relax
the
compression
of
the
abdominal
muscles
when
the
fills
and
distends
and
the
body
immediately
ascends
to
the
surface
how
simply
yet
how
wonderfully
has
the
supreme
being
adapted
certain
means
to
the
attainment
of
certain
ends
those
fishes
which
are
destitute
of
the
are
heavy
in
the
water
and
have
no
great
alacrity
in
rising
the
larger
proportion
of
them
remain
at
the
bottom
unless
they
are
so
formed
as
to
be
able
to
strike
their
native
element
downwards
with
sufficient
force
to
enable
them
to
ascend
when
the
of
a
fish
is
burst
its
power
of
ascending
to
the
surface
has
for
ever
passed
away
from
a
knowledge
of
this
fact
the
fishermen
of
cod
are
enabled
to
preserve
them
alive
for
a
considerable
time
in
their
the
means
they
adopt
to
accomplish
this
is
to
perforate
the
sound
or
with
a
needle
which
disengages
the
air
when
the
fishes
immediately
descend
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
into
which
they
are
thrown
without
this
operation
it
would
be
impossible
to
keep
the
cod
under
water
whilst
they
had
life
in
swimming
the
enable
fishes
to
preserve
their
upright
position
especially
those
of
the
belly
which
act
like
two
feet
without
those
they
would
swim
with
their
bellies
upward
as
it
is
in
their
backs
that
the
centre
of
gravity
lies
in
ascending
and
descending
these
are
likewise
of
great
assistance
as
they
contract
and
expand
accordingly
the
is
an
instrument
of
great
muscular
force
and
largely
assists
the
fish
in
all
its
motions
in
some
instances
it
acts
like
the
rudder
of
a
ship
and
enables
it
to
turn
sideways
and
when
moved
from
side
to
side
with
a
quick
vibratory
motion
fishes
are
made
in
the
same
manner
as
the
screw
propeller
makes
a
steamship
to
dart
forward
with
a
celerity
proportioned
to
the
muscular
force
with
which
it
is
employed
the
bodies
of
fishes
are
mostly
covered
with
a
kind
of
horny
scales
but
some
are
almost
entirely
without
them
or
have
them
so
minute
as
to
be
almost
invisible
as
is
the
case
with
the
eel
the
object
of
these
is
to
preserve
them
from
injury
by
the
pressure
of
the
water
or
the
sudden
contact
with
pebbles
rocks
or
others
again
are
enveloped
in
a
fatty
oleaginous
substance
also
intended
as
a
defence
against
the
friction
of
the
water
and
those
in
which
the
scales
are
small
are
supplied
with
a
larger
quantity
of
slimy
matter
the
respiration
of
fishes
is
effected
by
means
of
those
organs
which
are
placed
on
each
side
of
the
neck
and
which
are
called
gills
it
is
curious
to
watch
the
process
of
breathing
as
it
is
performed
by
the
finny
tribes
it
seems
to
be
so
continuous
that
it
might
almost
pass
for
an
illustration
of
the
vexed
problem
which
conceals
the
secret
of
perpetual
motion
in
performing
it
they
fill
their
mouths
with
water
which
they
drive
backwards
with
a
force
so
great
as
to
open
the
large
flap
to
allow
it
to
escape
behind
in
this
operation
all
or
a
great
portion
of
the
air
contained
in
the
water
is
left
among
the
processes
of
the
gills
and
is
carried
into
the
body
there
to
perform
its
part
in
the
animal
economy
in
proof
of
this
it
has
been
ascertained
that
if
the
water
in
which
fishes
are
put
is
by
any
means
denuded
of
its
air
they
immediately
seek
the
surface
and
begin
to
gasp
for
it
hence
distilled
water
is
to
them
what
a
vacuum
made
by
an
is
to
most
other
animals
for
this
reason
when
a
fishpond
or
other
aqueous
receptacle
in
which
fishes
are
kept
is
entirely
frozen
over
it
is
necessary
to
make
holes
in
the
ice
not
so
especially
for
the
purpose
of
feeding
them
as
for
that
of
giving
them
air
to
breathe
the
positions
of
the
teeth
of
fishes
are
well
calculated
to
excite
our
amazement
for
in
some
cases
these
are
situated
in
the
jaws
sometimes
on
the
tongue
or
palate
and
sometimes
even
in
the
throat
they
are
in
general
and
immovable
but
in
the
carp
they
are
obtuse
and
in
the
pike
so
easily
moved
as
to
seem
to
have
no
deeper
hold
than
such
as
the
mere
skin
can
afford
in
the
herring
the
tongue
is
set
with
teeth
to
enable
it
the
better
it
is
supposed
to
retain
its
food
although
naturalists
have
divided
fishes
into
two
great
tribes
the
and
the
yet
the
distinction
is
not
very
precise
for
the
first
have
a
great
deal
of
cartilage
and
the
second
at
any
rate
a
portion
of
calcareous
matter
in
their
bones
it
may
therefore
be
said
that
the
bones
of
fishes
form
a
kind
of
intermediate
substance
between
true
bones
and
cartilages
the
backbone
extends
through
the
whole
length
of
the
body
and
consists
of
vertebrae
strong
and
thick
towards
the
head
but
weaker
and
more
slender
as
it
approaches
the
tail
each
species
has
a
determinate
number
of
vertebrae
which
are
increased
in
size
in
proportion
with
the
body
the
ribs
are
attached
to
the
processes
of
the
vertebrae
and
inclose
the
breast
and
abdomen
some
kinds
as
the
rays
have
no
ribs
whilst
others
as
the
sturgeon
and
eel
have
very
short
ones
between
the
pointed
processes
of
the
vertebrae
are
situated
the
bones
which
support
the
dorsal
back
and
the
anal
below
the
tail
fins
which
are
connected
with
the
processes
by
a
ligament
at
the
breast
are
the
sternum
or
breastbone
clavicles
or
and
the
scapulae
or
on
which
the
pectoral
or
breast
fins
are
placed
the
bones
which
support
the
ventral
or
belly
fins
are
called
the
besides
these
principal
bones
there
are
often
other
smaller
ones
placed
between
the
muscles
to
assist
their
motion
some
of
the
organs
of
sense
in
fishes
are
supposed
to
be
possessed
by
them
in
a
high
degree
and
others
much
more
imperfectly
of
the
latter
kind
are
the
senses
of
touch
and
taste
which
are
believed
to
be
very
slightly
developed
on
the
other
hand
those
of
hearing
seeing
and
smelling
are
ascertained
to
be
acute
but
the
first
in
a
lesser
degree
than
both
the
second
and
third
their
possession
of
an
auditory
organ
was
long
doubted
and
even
denied
by
some
physiologists
but
it
has
been
found
placed
on
the
sides
of
the
skull
or
in
the
cavity
which
contains
the
brain
it
occupies
a
position
entirely
distinct
and
detached
from
the
skull
and
in
this
respect
differs
in
the
local
disposition
of
the
same
sense
in
birds
and
quadrupeds
in
some
fishes
as
in
those
of
the
ray
kind
the
organ
is
wholly
encompassed
by
those
parts
which
contain
the
cavity
of
the
skull
whilst
in
the
cod
and
salmon
kind
it
is
in
the
part
within
the
skull
its
structure
is
in
every
way
much
more
simple
than
that
of
the
same
sense
in
those
animals
which
live
entirely
in
the
air
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
have
the
adaptation
suitable
to
their
condition
in
some
genera
as
in
the
rays
the
external
orifice
or
ear
is
very
small
and
is
placed
in
the
upper
surface
of
the
head
whilst
in
others
there
is
no
visible
external
orifice
whatever
however
perfect
the
of
fishes
may
be
experience
has
shown
that
this
sense
is
of
much
less
use
to
them
than
that
of
smelling
in
searching
for
their
food
the
optic
nerves
in
fishes
have
this
peculiarity
that
they
are
not
confounded
with
one
another
in
their
middle
progress
between
their
origin
and
their
orbit
the
one
passes
over
the
other
without
any
communication
so
that
the
nerve
which
comes
from
the
left
side
of
the
brain
goes
distinctly
to
the
right
eye
and
that
which
comes
from
the
right
goes
distinctly
to
the
left
in
the
greater
part
of
them
the
eye
is
covered
with
the
same
transparent
skin
that
covers
the
rest
of
the
head
the
object
of
this
arrangement
perhaps
is
to
defend
it
from
the
action
of
the
water
as
there
are
no
eyelids
the
globe
in
front
is
somewhat
depressed
and
is
furnished
behind
with
a
muscle
which
serves
to
lengthen
or
flatten
it
according
to
the
necessities
of
the
animal
the
crystalline
humour
which
in
quadrupeds
is
flattened
is
in
fishes
nearly
globular
the
organ
of
in
fishes
is
large
and
is
endued
at
its
entry
with
a
dilating
and
contracting
power
which
is
employed
as
the
wants
of
the
animal
may
require
it
is
mostly
by
the
acuteness
of
their
smell
that
fishes
are
enabled
to
discover
their
food
for
their
tongue
is
not
designed
for
nice
sensation
being
of
too
firm
a
cartilaginous
substance
for
this
purpose
with
respect
to
the
food
of
fishes
this
is
almost
universally
found
in
their
own
element
they
are
mostly
carnivorous
though
they
seize
upon
almost
anything
that
comes
in
their
way
they
even
devour
their
own
offspring
and
manifest
a
particular
predilection
for
all
living
creatures
those
to
which
nature
has
meted
out
mouths
of
the
greatest
capacity
would
seem
to
pursue
everything
with
life
and
frequently
engage
in
fierce
conflicts
with
their
prey
the
animal
with
the
largest
mouth
is
usually
the
victor
and
he
has
no
sooner
conquered
his
foe
than
he
devours
him
innumerable
shoals
of
one
species
pursue
those
of
another
with
a
ferocity
which
draws
them
from
the
pole
to
the
equator
through
all
the
varying
temperatures
and
depths
of
their
boundless
domain
in
these
pursuits
a
scene
of
universal
violence
is
the
result
and
many
species
must
have
become
extinct
had
not
nature
accurately
proportioned
the
means
of
escape
the
production
and
the
numbers
to
the
extent
and
variety
of
the
danger
to
which
they
are
exposed
hence
the
smaller
species
are
not
only
more
numerous
but
more
productive
than
the
larger
whilst
their
instinct
leads
them
in
search
of
food
and
safety
near
the
shores
where
from
the
shallowness
of
the
waters
many
of
their
foes
are
unable
to
follow
them
the
fecundity
of
fishes
has
been
the
wonder
of
every
natural
philosopher
whose
attention
has
been
attracted
to
the
subject
they
are
in
general
oviparous
or
but
there
are
a
few
such
as
the
eel
and
the
blenny
which
are
viviparous
or
produce
their
young
alive
the
males
have
the
and
the
females
the
but
some
individuals
as
the
sturgeon
and
the
cod
tribes
are
said
to
contain
both
the
greater
number
deposit
their
spawn
in
the
sand
or
gravel
but
some
of
those
which
dwell
in
the
depths
of
the
ocean
attach
their
eggs
to
in
every
instance
however
their
fruitfulness
far
surpasses
that
of
any
other
race
of
animals
according
to
lewenhoeck
the
cod
annually
spawns
upwards
of
nine
millions
of
eggs
contained
in
a
single

with

succeeding
supply
of
food
and
the
conduits
of

to
perform
their
functions
unimpaired
the
age
of
fishes
has
not
been
properly
ascertained
although
it
is
believed
that
the
most
minute
of
the
species
has
a
longer
lease
of
life
than
man
the
mode
in
which
they
die
has
been
noted
by
the
rev
white
the
eminent
naturalist
of
selbourne
as
soon
as
the
fish
sickens
the
head
sinks
lower
and
lower
till
the
animal
as
it
were
stands
upon
it
after
this
as
it
becomes
weaker
it
loses
its
poise
till
the
tail
turns
over
when
it
comes
to
the
surface
and
floats
with
its
belly
upwards
the
reason
for
its
floating
in
this
manner
is
on
account
of
the
body
being
no
longer
balanced
by
the
fins
of
the
belly
and
the
broad
muscular
back
preponderating
by
its
own
gravity
over
the
belly
from
this
latter
being
a
cavity
and
consequently
lighter
fishes
are
either
solitary
or
gregarious
and
some
of
them
migrate
to
great
distances
and
into
certain
rivers
to
deposit
their
spawn
of
the
cod
herring
mackerel
and
many
others
assemble
in
immense
shoals
and
migrate
through
different
tracts
of
the
ocean
but
whether
considered
in
their
solitary
or
gregarious
capacity
they
are
alike
wonderful
to
all
who
look
through
nature
up
to
nature
god
and
consider
with
due
humility
yet
exalted
admiration
the
sublime
variety
beauty
power
and
grandeur
of
his
productions
as
manifested
in
the
creation
fish
as
an
article
of
human
food
as
the
nutritive
properties
of
fish
are
deemed
inferior
to
those
of
what
is
called
butchers
meat
it
would
appear
from
all
we
can
learn
that
in
all
ages
it
has
held
only
a
secondary
place
in
the
estimation
of
those
who
have
considered
the
science
of
gastronomy
as
a
large
element
in
the
happiness
of
mankind
among
the
jews
of
old
it
was
very
little
used
although
it
seems
not
to
have
been
entirely
interdicted
as
moses
prohibited
only
the
use
of
such
as
had
neither
scales
nor
fins
the
egyptians
however
made
fish
an
article
of
diet
notwithstanding
that
it
was
rejected
by
their
priests
egypt
however
is
not
a
country
favourable
to
the
production
of
fish
although
we
read
of
the
people
when
hungry
eating
it
raw
of
epicures
among
them
having
dried
it
in
the
sun
and
of
its
being
salted
and
preserved
to
serve
as
a
repast
on
days
of
great
solemnity
the
modern
egyptians
are
in
general
extremely
temperate
in
regard
to
food
even
the
richest
among
them
take
little
pride
and
perhaps
experience
as
little
delight
in
the
luxuries
of
the
table
their
dishes
mostly
consist
of
pilaus
soups
and
stews
prepared
principally
of
onions
cucumbers
and
other
cold
vegetables
mixed
with
a
little
meat
cut
into
small
pieces
on
special
occasions
however
a
whole
sheep
is
placed
on
the
festive
board
but
during
several
of
the
hottest
months
of
the
year
the
richest
restrict
themselves
entirely
to
a
vegetable
diet
the
poor
are
contented
with
a
little
oil
or
sour
milk
in
which
they
may
dip
their
bread
passing
from
africa
to
europe
we
come
amongst
a
people
who
have
almost
from
time
immemorial
occupied
a
high
place
in
the
estimation
of
every
civilized
country
yet
the
greeks
in
their
earlier
ages
made
very
little
use
of
fish
as
an
article
of
diet
in
the
eyes
of
the
heroes
of
homer
it
had
little
favour
for
menelaus
complained
that
hunger
pressed
their
digestive
organs
and
they
had
been
obliged
to
live
upon
fish
subsequently
however
fish
became
one
of
the
principal
articles
of
diet
amongst
the
hellenes
and
both
aristophanes
and
athenaeus
allude
to
it
and
even
satirize
their
countrymen
for
their
excessive
partiality
to
the
turbot
and
mullet
so
infatuated
were
many
of
the
greek
gastronomes
with
the
love
of
fish
that
some
of
them
would
have
preferred
death
from
indigestion
to
the
relinquishment
of
the
precious
dainties
with
which
a
few
of
the
species
supplied
them
philoxenes
of
cythera
was
one
of
these
on
being
informed
by
his
physician
that
he
was
going
to
die
of
indigestion
on
account
of
the
quantity
he
was
consuming
of
a
delicious
fish
be
it
so
he
calmly
observed
but
before
i
die
let
me
finish
the
remainder
the
geographical
situation
of
greece
was
highly
favourable
for
the
development
of
a
taste
for
the
piscatory
tribes
and
the
skill
of
the
greek
cooks
was
so
great
that
they
could
impart
every
variety
of
relish
to
the
dish
they
were
called
upon
to
prepare
athenaeus
has
transmitted
to
posterity
some
very
important
precepts
upon
their
ingenuity
in
seasoning
with
salt
oil
and
aromatics
at
the
present
day
the
food
of
the
greeks
through
the
combined
influence
of
poverty
and
the
long
fasts
which
their
religion
imposes
upon
them
is
to
a
large
extent
composed
of
fish
accompanied
with
vegetables
and
fruit
caviare
prepared
from
the
roes
of
sturgeons
is
the
national
ragout
which
like
all
other
fish
dishes
they
season
with
aromatic
herbs
snails
dressed
in
garlic
are
also
a
favourite
dish
as
the
romans
in
a
great
measure
took
their
taste
in
the
fine
arts
from
the
greeks
so
did
they
in
some
measure
their
piscine
appetites
the
and
the
lotas
liver
were
the
favourite
fish
dishes
of
the
roman
epicures
whilst
the
red
mullet
was
esteemed
as
one
of
the
most
delicate
fishes
that
could
be
brought
to
the
table
with
all
the
elegance
taste
and
refinement
of
roman
luxury
it
was
sometimes
promoted
or
accompanied
by
acts
of
great
barbarity
in
proof
of
this
the
mention
of
the
red
mullet
suggests
the
mode
in
which
it
was
sometimes
treated
for
the
to
us
entertainment
of
the
in
roman
circles
it
may
be
premised
that
as
england
has
rome
in
her
palmy
days
had
her
fops
who
had
no
doubt
through
the
medium
of
their
cooks
discovered
that
when
the
scales
of
the
red
mullet
were
removed
the
flesh
presented
a
fine
having
discovered
this
it
was
further
observed
that
at
the
death
of
the
animal
this
colour
passed
through
a
succession
of
beautiful
shades
and
in
order
that
these
might
be
witnessed
and
enjoyed
in
their
fullest
perfection
the
poor
mullet
was
served
alive
in
a
glass
vessel
the
love
of
fish
among
the
ancient
romans
rose
to
a
real
mania
apicius
offered
a
prize
to
any
one
who
could
invent
a
new
brine
compounded
of
the
liver
of
red
mullets
and
lucullus
had
a
canal
cut
through
a
mountain
in
the
neighbourhood
of
naples
that
fish
might
be
the
more
easily
transported
to
the
gardens
of
his
villa
hortensius
the
orator
wept
over
the
death
of
a
turbot
which
he
had
fed
with
his
own
hands
and
the
daughter
of
druses
adorned
one
that
she
had
with
rings
of
gold
these
were
surely
instances
of
misplaced
affection
but
there
is
no
accounting
for
tastes
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
we
read
in
the
of
a
wealthy
english
hermit
who
delights
in
the
companionship
of
rats
the
modern
romans
are
merged
in
the
general
name
of
italians
who
with
the
exception
of
macaroni
have
no
specially
characteristic
article
of
food
from
rome
to
gaul
is
considering
the
means
of
modern
locomotion
no
great
way
but
the
ancient
sumptuary
laws
of
that
kingdom
give
us
little
information
regarding
the
ichthyophagous
propensities
of
its
inhabitants
louis
xii
engaged
six
fishmongers
to
furnish
his
board
with
animals
and
francis
had
whilst
henry
the
great
extended
his
requirements
a
little
further
and
had
in
the
time
of
louis
xiv
the
cooks
had
attained
to
such
a
degree
of
perfection
in
their
art
that
they
could
convert
the
form
and
flesh
of
the
trout
pike
or
carp
into
the
very
shape
and
flavour
of
the
most
delicious
game
the
french
long
enjoyed
a
european
reputation
for
their
skill
and
refinement
in
the
preparing
of
food
in
place
of
plain
joints
french
cookery
delights
in
the
marvels
of
what
are
called
made
dishes
ragouts
stews
and
fricassees
in
which
no
trace
of
the
original
materials
of
which
they
are
compounded
is
to
be
found
from
gaul
we
cross
to
britain
where
it
has
been
asserted
by
at
least
one
authority
that
the
ancient
inhabitants
ate
no
fish
however
this
may
be
we
know
that
the
british
shores
particularly
those
of
the
north
sea
have
always
been
well
supplied
with
the
best
kinds
of
fish
which
we
may
reasonably
infer
was
not
unknown
to
the
inhabitants
or
likely
to
be
lost
upon
them
for
the
lack
of
knowledge
as
to
how
they
tasted
by
the
time
of
edward
fish
had
in
england
become
a
dainty
especially
the
sturgeon
which
was
permitted
to
appear
on
no
table
but
that
of
the
king
in
the
fourteenth
century
a
decree
of
king
john
informs
us
that
the
people
ate
both
seals
and
porpoises
whilst
in
the
days
of
the
troubadours
whales
were
fished
for
and
caught
in
the
mediterranean
sea
for
the
purpose
of
being
used
as
human
food
whatever
checks
the
ancient
british
may
have
had
upon
their
piscatory
appetites
there
are
happily
none
of
any
great
consequence
upon
the
modern
who
delight
in
wholesome
food
of
every
kind
their
taste
is
perhaps
too
much
inclined
to
that
which
is
accounted
solid
and
substantial
but
they
really
eat
more
moderately
even
of
animal
food
than
either
the
french
or
the
germans
roast
beef
or
other
viands
cooked
in
the
plainest
manner
are
with
them
a
sufficient
luxury
yet
they
delight
in
living
whilst
it
is
easy
to
prove
how
largely
their
affections
are
developed
by
even
the
prospect
of
a
substantial
cheer
in
proof
of
this
we
will
just
observe
that
if
a
great
dinner
is
to
be
celebrated
it
is
not
uncommon
for
the
appointed
stewards
and
committee
to
meet
and
have
a
preliminary
dinner
among
themselves
in
order
to
arrange
the
great
one
and
after
that
to
have
another
dinner
to
discharge
the
bill
which
the
great
one
cost
this
enjoyable
disposition
we
take
to
form
a
very
large
item
in
the
aggregate
happiness
of
the
nation
the
general
use
of
fish
as
an
article
of
human
food
among
civilized
nations
we
have
thus
sufficiently
shown
and
will
conclude
this
portion
of
our
subject
with
the
following
hints
which
ought
to
be
remembered
by
all
those
who
are
fond
of
occasionally
varying
their
dietary
with
a
piscine
dish
i
fish
shortly
before
they
spawn
are
in
general
best
in
condition
when
the
spawning
is
just
over
they
are
out
of
season
and
unfit
for
human
food
ii
when
fish
is
out
of
season
it
has
a
transparent
bluish
tinge
however
much
it
may
be
boiled
when
it
is
in
season
its
muscles
are
firm
and
boil
white
and
curdy
iii
as
food
for
invalids
white
fish
such
as
the
ling
cod
haddock
and
whiting
are
the
best
flat
fish
as
soles
skate
turbot
and
flounders
are
also
good
iv
salmon
mackerel
herrings
and
trout
soon
spoil
or
decompose
after
they
are
killed
therefore
to
be
in
perfection
they
should
be
prepared
for
the
table
on
the
day
they
are
caught
with
flat
fish
this
is
not
of
such
consequence
as
they
will
keep
longer
the
turbot
for
example
is
improved
by
being
kept
a
day
or
two
general
directions
for
dressing
fish
in
dressing
fish
of
any
kind
the
first
point
to
be
attended
to
is
to
see
that
it
be
perfectly
clean
it
is
a
common
error
to
wash
it
too
much
as
by
doing
so
the
flavour
is
diminished
if
the
fish
is
to
be
boiled
a
little
salt
and
vinegar
should
be
put
into
the
water
to
give
it
firmness
after
it
is
cleaned
whiting
and
haddock
are
far
better
if
a
little
salted
and
kept
a
day
and
if
the
weather
be
not
very
hot
they
will
be
good
for
two
days
when
fish
is
cheap
and
plentiful
and
a
larger
quantity
is
purchased
than
is
immediately
wanted
the
overplus
of
such
as
will
bear
it
should
be
potted
or
pickled
or
salted
and
hung
up
or
it
may
be
fried
that
it
may
serve
for
stewing
the
next
day
fish
having
frequently
a
muddy
smell
and
taste
should
be
soaked
in
strong
salt
and
water
after
it
has
been
well
cleaned
if
of
a
sufficient
size
it
may
be
scalded
in
salt
and
water
and
afterwards
dried
and
dressed
fish
should
be
put
into
cold
water
and
set
on
the
fire
to
do
very
gently
or
the
outside
will
break
before
the
inner
part
is
done
unless
the
fishes
are
small
they
should
never
be
put
into
warm
water
nor
should
water
either
hot
or
cold
be
poured
to
the
fish
as
it
is
liable
to
break
the
skin
if
it
should
be
necessary
to
add
a
little
water
whilst
the
fish
is
cooking
it
ought
to
be
poured
in
gently
at
the
side
of
the
vessel
the
may
be
drawn
up
to
see
if
the
fish
be
ready
which
may
be
known
by
its
easily
separating
from
the
bone
it
should
then
be
immediately
taken
out
of
the
water
or
it
will
become
woolly
the
should
be
set
crossways
over
the
kettle
to
keep
hot
for
serving
and
a
clean
cloth
over
the
fish
to
prevent
its
losing
its
colour
in
garnishing
fish
great
attention
is
required
and
plenty
of
parsley
horseradish
and
lemon
should
be
used
if
fried
parsley
be
used
it
must
be
washed
and
picked
and
thrown
into
fresh
water
when
the
lard
or
dripping
boils
throw
the
parsley
into
it
immediately
from
the
water
and
instantly
it
will
be
green
and
crisp
and
must
be
taken
up
with
a
slice
when
well
done
and
with
very
good
sauce
fish
is
more
appreciated
than
almost
any
other
dish
the
liver
and
roe
in
some
instances
should
be
placed
on
the
dish
in
order
that
they
may
be
distributed
in
the
course
of
serving
but
to
each
recipe
will
be
appended
the
proper
mode
of
serving
and
garnishing
if
fish
is
to
be
fried
or
broiled
it
must
be
dried
in
a
nice
soft
cloth
after
it
is
well
cleaned
and
washed
if
for
frying
brush
it
over
with
egg
and
sprinkle
it
with
some
fine
crumbs
of
bread
if
done
a
second
time
with
the
egg
and
bread
the
fish
will
look
so
much
the
better
if
required
to
be
very
nice
a
sheet
of
white
must
be
placed
to
receive
it
that
it
may
be
free
from
all
grease
it
must
also
be
of
a
beautiful
colour
and
all
the
crumbs
appear
distinct
butter
gives
a
bad
colour
lard
and
clarified
dripping
are
most
frequently
used
but
oil
is
the
best
if
the
expense
be
no
objection
the
fish
should
be
put
into
the
lard
when
boiling
and
there
should
be
a
sufficiency
of
this
to
cover
it
when
fish
is
broiled
it
must
be
seasoned
floured
and
laid
on
a
very
clean
gridiron
which
when
hot
should

fish
is
more
difficult
than
to
give
the
average
prices
of
fish
inasmuch
as
a
few
hours
of
bad
weather
at
sea
will
in
the
space
of
one
day
cause
such
a
difference
in
its
supply
that
the

fish

turbot
for
instance
which
may
be
bought
for
six
or
seven
shillings
will
be
in

markets
worth
perhaps
almost
as
many
pounds
the
average
costs
therefore
which
will
be
found
appended
to

be

as

general
rule
in

of

goodness
in

is
their
being
covered

sign

its

is

have
spoken

the
amazing
fruitfulness
of
this

in

we
see
one
more
instance
of
the
wise
provision
which
nature
has
made
for
supplying
the
wants
of
man
so
extensive
has
been
the
consumption
of
this
fish
that
it
is
surprising
that
it
has
not
long
ago
become
extinct
which
would
certainly
have
been
the
case
had
it
not
been
for
its
wonderful
powers
of
reproduction
so
early
as
says
cloquet
the
inhabitants
of
amsterdam
had
dispatched
fishermen
to
the
coast
of
sweden

in

first
quarter
of

the
ports
of
france
only
vessels
went
out
to
the
every
year
however
upwards
of
vessels
of
all
nations
are
employed
in
this
trade
and
bring
into
the
commercial
world
more
than
of
salted
and
dried
cod
if
we
add
to
this
immense
number
the
havoc
made
among
the
legions
of
cod
by
the
larger
scaly
tribes
of
the
great
deep
and
take
into
account
the
destruction
to
which
the
young
are
exposed
by

other
inhabitants
of

the
myriads
of

this

known
frequently
to
quit
its
native
element

to
set
off
on

expedition
in

night

just
about
the
close
of
clay
over
the
meadows
in

of
snails
and

sometimes
betakes
itself
to

for
no

pleasure
than
that
which

the
productiveness
of
the
having
occasion
says
anderson
in
the
to
be
once
on
a
visit
to
a
house
on
in
aberdeenshire
i
frequently
delighted
to
walk
by
the
banks
of
the
river
i
one
day
observed
something
like
a
black
string
moving
along
the
edge
of
the
water
where
it
was
quite
shallow
upon
closer
inspection
i
discovered
that
this
was
a
shoal
of
young
eels
so
closely
joined
together
as
to
appear
on
a
superficial
view
on
continued
body
moving
briskly
up
against
the
stream
to
avoid
the
retardment
they
experienced
from
the
force
of
the
current
they
kept
close
along
the
edge
the
whole
of
the
way
following
all
the
bendings
and
sinuosities
of
the
river
where
they
were
embayed
and
in
still
water
the
shoal
dilated
in
breadth
so
as
to
be
sometimes
nearly
a
foot
broad
but
when
they
turned
a
cape
where
the
current
was
strong
they
were
forced
to
occupy
less
space
and
press
close
to
the
shore
struggling
very
hard
till
they
passed
it
this
shoal
continued
to
move
on
night
and
day
without
interruption
for
several
weeks
their
progress
might
be
at
the
rate
of
about
a
mile
an
hour
it
was
easy
to
catch
the
animals
though
they
were
very
active
and
nimble
they
were
eels
perfectly
well
formed
in
every
respect
but
not
exceeding
two
inches
in
length
i
conceive
that
the
shoal
did
not
contain
on
an
average
less
than
from
twelve
to
twenty
in
breadth
so
that
the
number
that
passed
on
the
whole
must
have
been
very
great

they
came

they
went

he
says
that
towards

century
it
was
a
most
common
thing
for

entertainment
in

to
commence
with
oysters

that
many
guests
were
not
contented
without
swallowing
twelve
dozen
being
anxious
to
know
the

of
this
he
ascertained
that
a

weighed

thus
the
twelve

would
weigh
about

there
can

his

kept
company

him
in
swallowing
the
delicious
bivalves

to
the
tenth

exhausted
he
gave
up

this
gentleman
managed
to
eat
dozen
within
an
hour

would
doubtless
have
got
through
more
but
the
person
who
opened
them
is
described
as
not
being
very
skilful
in
the
interim
savarin
was
idle
and
at
length
tired
with
his
painful
state
of
inaction

said

was

an
anecdote
is
told
of
the
prince
de
soubise
who
intending
to
give
an
entertainment
asked
for
the
bill
of
fare
his
came
presenting
a
list
adorned
with
vignettes
and
the

of
which
that

eye
was
fifty

said
the
prince
i
think
you
must
be
extravagant
fifty

do
you
intend
to
feast
my
whole
regiment
no
prince
there
will
be
but
one
on
the

and
the
surplus
i
need
for
my

are

this
item

monseigneur
said
the
you
do
not
appreciate
me
give
me
the
order
and
i
will
put
those
fifty
hams
in
a
crystal
flask
no
longer
than
my
thumb
the
prince
smiled
and
the
hams
were
passed
this
was
all
very
well
for
the
prince
de
soubise
but
as
we
do
not
write
for
princes
and
nobles
alone
but
that
our
british
sisters
may
make
the
best
dishes
out
of
the
least
expensive
ingredients
we
will
also
pass
the
hams
and
give
a
few
general
directions
concerning
sauces
the
preparation
and
appearance
of
sauces
and
gravies
are
of
the
highest
consequence
and
in
nothing
does
the
talent
and
taste
of
the
cook
more
display
itself
their
special
adaptability
to
the
various
viands
they
are
to
accompany
can
not
be
too
much
studied
in
order
that
they
may
harmonize
and
blend
with
them
as
perfectly
so
to
speak
as
does
a
pianoforte
accompaniment
with
the
voice
of
the
singer
the
general
basis
of
most
gravies
and
some
sauces
is
the
same
stock
as
that
used
for
soups
nos
and
and
by
the
employment
of
these
with
perhaps
an
additional
slice
of
ham
a
little
spice
a
few
herbs
and
a
slight
flavouring
from
some
cold
sauce
or
ketchup
very
nice
gravies
may
be
made
for
a
very
small
expenditure
a
milt
either
of
a
bullock
or
sheep
the
of
mutton
that
has
already
been
dressed
and
the
necks
and
feet
of
poultry
may
all
be
advantageously
used
for
gravy
where
much
is
not
required
it
may
then
be
established
as
a
rule
that
there
exists
no
necessity
for
good
gravies
to
be
expensive
and
that
there
is
no
occasion
as
many
would
have
the
world
believe
to
buy
ever
so
many
pounds
of
fresh
meat
in
order
to
furnish
an
ever
so
little
quantity
of
gravy
brown
sauces
generally
speaking
should
scarcely
be
so
thick
as
white
sauces
and
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
all
those
which
are
intended
to
mask
the
various
dishes
of
poultry
or
meat
should
be
of
a
sufficient
consistency
to
slightly
adhere
to
the
fowls
or
joints
over
which
they
are
poured
for
browning
and
thickening
sauces
browned
flour
may
be
properly
employed
sauces
should
possess
a
decided
character
and
whether
sharp
or
sweet
savoury
or
plain
they
should
carry
out
their
names
in
a
distinct
manner
although
of
course
not
so
much
flavoured
as
to
make
them
too
piquant
on
the
one
hand
or
too
mawkish
on
the
other
gravies
and
sauces
should
be
sent
to
table
very
hot
and
there
is
all
the
more
necessity
for
the
cook
to
see
to
this
point
as
from
their
being
usually
served
in
small
quantities
they
are
more
liable
to
cool
quickly
than
if
they
were
in
a
larger
body
those
sauces
of
which
cream
or
eggs
form
a
component
part
should
be
well
stirred
as
soon
as
these
ingredients
are
added
to
them
and
must
never
be
allowed
to
boil
as
in
that
case
they
would
instantly
curdle
although
pickles
may
be
purchased
at
shops
at
as
low
a
rate
as
they
can
usually
be
made
for
at
home
or
perhaps
even
for
less
yet
we
would
advise
all
housewives
who
have
sufficient
time
and
convenience
to
prepare
their
own
the
only
general
rules
perhaps
worth
stating
here
as
in
the
recipes
all
necessary
details
will
be
explained
are
that
the
vegetables
and
fruits
used
should
be
sound
and
not
over
ripe
and
that
the
very
best
vinegar
should
be
employed
for
forcemeats
special
attention
is
necessary
the
points
which
cooks
should
in
this
branch
of
cookery
more
particularly
observe
are
the
thorough
chopping
of
the
suet
the
complete
mincing
of
the
herbs
the
careful
grating
of
the
and
the
perfect
mixing
of
the
whole
these
are
the
three
principal
ingredients
of
forcemeats
and
they
can
scarcely
be
cut
too
small
as
nothing
like
a
lump
or
fibre
should
be
anywhere
perceptible
to
conclude
the
flavour
of
no
one
spice
or
herb
should
be
permitted
to
predominate

the
gooseberry
the
this
useful

wholesome
fruit
is
thought
to
be
indigenous
to
the
british
isles
and
may
be
occasionally
found
in
a
wild
state
in
some
of
the
eastern
counties
although
when
uncultivated
it
is
but
a
very
small
and
inferior
berry
the
high
state
of
perfection
to
which
it
has
been
here
brought
is
due
to
the
skill
of
the
english
gardeners
for
in
no
other
country
does
it
attain
the
same
size
and
flavour
the
humidity
of
the
british
climate
however
has
doubtless
something
to
do
with
the
result
and
it
is
said
that
gooseberries
produced
in
scotland
as
far
north
as
inverness
are
of
a
very
superior
character
malic
and
citric
acid
blended
with
sugar
produce
the
pleasant
flavour
of
the

sorrel
we
gather
from
the
pages
of
pliny
and
apicius
that
sorrel
was
cultivated
by
the
romans
in

give
it
more
strength
and
flavour

that
they
also
partook
of
it
sometimes

english
cookery
is
not
much
indebted
to
this
plant

the
french
make
use

is
found
in

parts
of

in

it
should
be
borne
in

however
that
the
goodness
and
strength
of
spices

evaporate
and
that
they
lose
a
great
deal
of
their
fragrance
if
added
to

time
before
they
are
wanted
if
this
point
is

not
necessarily
be
so
very
expensive

oftentimes
found
as
savoury
and
wholesome
as

the
cook
should
also
remember
that
the
fragrance
of
gravies
should
not
be
overpowered
by
too
much
spice
or
any
strong
essences
and
that
they
should
always
be
warmed
in
a

are
flavoured

else
in
a

or

placed
in
a

full

the
remains

should
always
be

the

far
far

in

loved

what
it

that
when

ordered
his
son
esau
to
go
out
with
his
weapons
his
quiver
and
his
bow
and
to
prepare
for
him
savoury
meat
such
as
he
loved
that
it
was
venison
he
desired
the

solomon

delighted
in

that
at

every

were
served
the

ox
the
roebuck
and
the

xenophon
informs
us
in
his
history
that
cyrus
king
of
persia
ordered
that
venison
should
never
be
wanting
at
his
repasts
and
of
the
effeminate
greeks
it
was
the
delight
the
romans
also
were
devoted
admirers
of

themselves
bravely

dry
herbs
for

use
on
a
very
dry

gather
the

just
before

begin
to
flower
if
this
is
done
when
the
weather
is

it
is
very
necessary
to
be
particular
in
little
matters
like
this
for
trifles
constitute
perfection
and
herbs
nicely
dried
will
be
found
very
acceptable
when
frost
and
snow
are
on
the
ground
it
is
hardly
necessary
however
to
state
that
the
flavour
and
fragrance
of
fresh
herbs
are
incomparably
finer
they
should
be
perfectly
freed
from
dirt
and
dust
and
be
divided
into
small
bunches
with
their
roots
cut
off
dry
them
quickly
in
a
very
hot
oven
or
before
the
fire
as
by
this
means
most
of
their
flavour
will
be
preserved
and
be
careful
not
to
burn
them
tie
them
up
in
paper

to

their

pickles
and
store

there
will
be
economy
of
it
in
the
long
run
this
term
is
derived
from
the
two
french
words

and
should
therefore
be
strictly
applied
to

from

it

have
been
cultivated
in

a
few
years
they
deteriorate
both
in

it
is
therefore
most
likely
that
this

was
first
introduced
into

from

that
it
originally
was
produced
in

very
simple
method
and
exceedingly
good
pickling
onions
to
each
quart
of
vinegar
teaspoonfuls
of
allspice
teaspoonfuls
of
whole
black
pepper
have
the
onions
gathered
when
quite
dry
and
ripe
and
with
the
fingers
take
off
the
thin
outside
skin
then
with
a
silver
knife
steel
should
not
be
used
as
it
spoils
the
colour
of
the
onions
remove
one
more
skin
when
the
onion
will
look
quite
clear
have
ready
some
very
dry
bottles
or
jars
and
as
fast
as
they
are
peeled
put
them
in
pour
over
sufficient
cold
vinegar
to
cover
them
with
pepper
and
allspice
in
the
above
proportions
taking
care
that
each
jar
has
its
share
of
the
latter
ingredients
tie
down
with
bladder
and
put
them
in
a
dry
place
and
in
a
fortnight
they
will
be
fit
for
use
this
is
a
most
simple
recipe
and
very
delicious
the
onions
being
nice
and
crisp
they
should
be
eaten
within
or
months
after
being
done
as
the
onions
are
liable
to
become
soft

the
middle
of

remember
the

we
recommend

no

never

fewer
than

may
answer
the
purpose

the

spoke
very
highly
in
its

this

a

frequently
made

and
comes
from

where
it
is
prepared
from
the
seeds
of

it
but
that
made
by

said
to
be
the
best
all
sorts
of
statements
have
been
made
respecting
the
very
general
adulteration
of
this

in

and
we
fear
that
many
of
them
are
too
true

further
learn
that
queen
catharine
herself
with
all
her
royalty
could
not
procure
a
salad
of
english
growth
for
her
dinner
the
king
was

this

the

distinct

general
remarks
in
our
introduction
to
cookery
no
we
have
described
the
gradual
progress
of
mankind
in
the
art
of
cookery
the
probability
being
that
the
human
race
for
a
long
period
lived
wholly
on
fruits
man
means
of
attacking
animals
even
if
he
had
the
desire
of
slaughtering
them
were
very
limited
until
he
acquired
the
use
of
arms
he
however
made
weapons
for
himself
and
impelled
by
a
carnivorous
instinct
made
prey
of
the
animals
that
surrounded
him
it
is
natural
that
man
should
seek
to
feed
on
flesh
he
has
too
small
a
stomach
to
be
supported
alone
by
fruit
which
has
not
sufficient
nourishment
to
renovate
him
it
is
possible
he
might
subsist
on
vegetables
but
their
preparation
needs
the
knowledge
of
art
only
to
be
obtained
after
the
lapse
of
many
centuries
man
first
weapons
were
the
branches
of
trees
which
were
succeeded
by
bows
and
arrows
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
these
latter
weapons
have
been
found
with
the
natives
of
all
climates
and
latitudes
it
is
singular
how
this
idea
presented
itself
to
individuals
so
differently
placed
brillat
savarin
says
that
raw
flesh
has
but
one
inconvenience
from
its
viscousness
it
attaches
itself
to
the
teeth
he
goes
on
to
say
that
it
is
not
however
disagreeable
but
when
seasoned
with
salt
that
it
is
easily
digested
he
tells
a
story
of
a
croat
captain
whom
he
invited
to
dinner
in
during
the
occupation
of
paris
by
the
allied
troops
this
officer
was
amazed
at
his
preparations
and
said
when
we
are
campaigning
and
get
hungry
we
knock
over
the
first
animal
we
find
cut
off
a
steak
powder
it
with
salt
which
we
always
have
in
the
sabretasche
put
it
under
the
saddle
gallop
over
it
for
half
a
mile
and
then
dine
like
princes
again
of
the
huntsmen
of
dauphiny
it
is
said
that
when
they
are
out
shooting
in
september
they
take
with
them
both
pepper
and
salt
if
they
kill
a
very
fat
bird
they
pluck
and
season
it
and
after
carrying
it
some
time
in
their
caps
eat
it
this
they
declare
is
the
best
way
of
serving
it
up
subsequently
to
the
croat
mode
which
doubtless
was
in
fashion
in
the
earlier
ages
of
the
world
fire
was
discovered
this
was
an
accident
for
fire
is
not
although
we
are
accustomed
to
call
it
so
an
element
or
spontaneous
many
savage
nations
have
been
found
utterly
ignorant
of
it
and
many
races
had
no
other
way
of
dressing
their
food
than
by
exposing
it
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
inhabitants
of
the
marian
islands
which
were
discovered
in
had
no
idea
of
fire
never
was
astonishment
greater
than
theirs
when
they
first
saw
it
on
the
descent
of
magellan
the
navigator
on
one
of
their
isles
at
first
they
thought
it
a
kind
of
animal
that
fixed
itself
to
and
fed
upon
wood
some
of
them
who
approached
too
near
being
burnt
the
rest
were
terrified
and
durst
only
look
upon
it
at
a
distance
they
were
afraid
they
said
of
being
bit
or
lest
that
dreadful
animal
should
wound
with
his
violent
respiration
and
dreadful
breath
for
these
were
the
first
notions
they
formed
of
the
heat
and
flame
such
too
probably
were
the
notions
the
greeks
originally
formed
of
them
fire
having
been
discovered
mankind
endeavoured
to
make
use
of
it
for
drying
and
afterwards
for
cooking
their
meat
but
they
were
a
considerable
time
before
they
hit
upon
proper
and
commodious
methods
of
employing
it
in
the
preparation
of
their
food
meat
then
placed
on
burning
fuel
was
found
better
than
when
raw
it
had
more
firmness
was
eaten
with
less
difficulty
and
the
ozmazome
being
condensed
by
the
carbonization
gave
it
a
pleasing
perfume
and
flavour
still
however
the
meat
cooked
on
the
coal
would
become
somewhat
befouled
certain
portions
of
the
fuel
adhering
to
it
this
disadvantage
was
remedied
by
passing
spits
through
it
and
placing
it
at
a
suitable
height
above
the
burning
fuel
thus
grilling
was
invented
and
it
is
well
known
that
simple
as
is
this
mode
of
cookery
yet
all
meat
cooked
in
this
way
is
richly
and
pleasantly
flavoured
in
time
the
art
of
cookery
had
not
advanced
much
beyond
this
for
we
read
in
the
iliad
how
the
great
achilles
and
his
friend
patroclus
regaled
the
three
grecian
leaders
on
bread
wine
and
broiled
meat
it
is
noticeable
too
that
homer
does
not
speak
of
boiled
meat
anywhere
in
his
poems
later
however
the
jews
coming
out
of
their
captivity
in
egypt
had
made
much
greater
progress
they
undoubtedly
possessed
kettles
and
in
one
of
these
esau
mess
of
pottage
for
which
he
sold
his
birthright
must
have
been
prepared
having
thus
briefly
traced
a
history
of
gastronomical
progresses
we
will
now
proceed
to
describe
the
various
methods
of
cooking
meat
and
make
a
few
observations
on
the
chemical
changes
which
occur
in
each
of
the
operations
in
this
country
plain
boiling
roasting
and
baking
are
the
usual
methods
of
cooking
animal
food
to
explain
the
philosophy
of
these
simple
culinary
operations
we
must
advert
to
the
effects
that
are
produced
by
heat
on
the
principal
constituents
of
flesh
when
mutton
or
beef
is
steeped
for
some
time
in
a
small
quantity
of
clean
water
and
then
subjected
to
slight
pressure
the
juice
of
the
meat
is
extracted
and
there
is
left
a
white
tasteless
residue
consisting
chiefly
of
muscular
fibres
when
this
residue
is
heated
to
between
and
fahrenheit
the
fibres
shrink
together
and
become
hard
and
horny
the
influence
of
an
elevated
temperature
on
the
soluble
extract
of
flesh
is
not
less
remarkable
when
the
watery
infusion
which
contains
all
the
savoury
constituents
of
the
meat
is
gradually
heated
it
soon
becomes
turbid
and
when
the
temperature
reaches
flakes
of
whitish
matter
separate
these
flakes
are
a
substance
precisely
similar
in
all
its
properties
to
the
white
of
egg
see
no
when
the
temperature
of
the
watery
extract
is
raised
to
the
colouring
matter
of
the
blood
coagulates
and
the
liquid
which
was
originally
tinged
red
by
this
substance
is
left
perfectly
clear
and
almost
colourless
when
evaporated
even
at
a
gentle
heat
this
residual
liquid
gradually
becomes
brown
and
acquires
the
flavour
of
roast
meat
these
interesting
facts
discovered
in
the
laboratory
throw
a
flood
of
light
upon
the
mysteries
of
the
kitchen
the
fibres
of
meat
are
surrounded
by
a
liquid
which
contains
albumen
in
its
soluble
state
just
as
it
exists
in
the
unboiled
egg
during
the
operation
of
boiling
or
roasting
this
substance
coagulates
and
thereby
prevents
the
contraction
and
hardening
of
the
fibres
the
tenderness
of
meat
is
consequently
proportioned
to
the
amount
of
albumen
deposited
in
its
substance
meat
is
underdone
when
it
has
been
heated
throughout
only
to
the
temperature
of
coagulating
albumen
it
is
thoroughly
done
when
it
has
been
heated
through
its
whole
mass
to
the
temperature
at
which
the
colouring
matter
of
the
blood
coagulates
it
is
overdone
when
the
heat
has
been
continued
long
enough
to
harden
the
fibres
the
juice
of
flesh
is
water
holding
in
solution
many
substances
besides
albumen
which
are
of
the
highest
possible
value
as
articles
of
food
in
preparing
meat
for
the
table
great
care
should
be
taken
to
prevent
the
escape
of
this
precious
juice
as
the
succulence
and
sapidity
of
the
meat
depend
on
its
retention
the
meat
to
be
cooked
should
be
exposed
at
first
to
a
quick
heat
which
immediately
coagulates
the
albumen
on
and
near
the
surface
a
kind
of
shell
is
thus
formed
which
effectually
retains
the
whole
of
the
juice
within
the
meat
during
the
operations
of
boiling
boasting
and
baking
fresh
beef
and
mutton

baking
dish
the
difference
between
roasting
meat
and
baking
it
may
be
generally
described
as
consisting
in
the
fact
that
in
baking
it
the
fumes
caused
by
the
operation
are
not
carried
off
in
the
same
way
as
occurs
in
roasting
much
however
of
this
disadvantage
is
obviated
by
the
improved
construction
of
modern
ovens
and
of
especially
those
in
connection
with

a

the

be
said
to

that

it
will
be

prevent
the

being
scorched

this

special
heads
may

the
principal
of
these
are
soup
gravies
jugged
hare
beef
tea
and
this
mode
of
cooking
may
be
advantageously
adopted
with
a
ham
which
has
previously
been
covered
with
a
common
crust
of
flour
and
water
all
dishes
prepared
for

should
be
more
highly
seasoned

are
some
dishes
which
it
may
be
said
are
at

equally
well

as
by

thus
a
shoulder
of
mutton
and
baked
potatoes
a
fillet
or
breast
of

a

a

well
basted
will
be

the
preparation
of
meat
by

water
though
one
of
the
easiest
processes
in
cookery
requires
skilful
management
boiled
meat
should
be
tender
savoury
and
full
of
its
own
juice
or
natural
gravy
but
through
the
carelessness
and
ignorance
of
cooks
it
is
too
often
sent
to
table
hard
tasteless
and
innutritious
to
insure
a
successful
result
in
boiling
flesh
the
heat
of
the
fire
must
be
judiciously
regulated
the
proper
quantity
of
water
must
be
kept
up
in
the
pot
and
the
scum
which
rises
to
the
surface
must
be
carefully
removed
many
writers
on
cookery
assert
that
the
meat
to
be
boiled
should
be
put
into
cold
water
and
that
the
pot
should
be
heated
gradually
but
liebig
the
highest
authority
on
all
matters
connected
with
the
chemistry
of
food
has
shown
that
meat
so
treated
loses
some
of
its
most
nutritious
constituents
if
the
flesh
says
the
great
chemist
be
introduced
into
the
boiler
when
the
water
is
in
a
state
of
brisk
ebullition
and
if
the
boiling
be
kept
up
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
pot
then
placed
in
a
warm
place
so
that
the
temperature
of
the
water
is
kept
at
to
we
have
the
united
conditions
for
giving
to
the
flesh
the
qualities
which
best
fit
it
for
being
eaten
when
a
piece
of
meat
is
plunged
into
boiling
water
the
albumen
which
is
near
the
surface
immediately
coagulates
forming
an
envelope
which
prevents
the
escape
of
the
internal
juice
and
most
effectually
excludes
the
water
which
by
mixing
with
this
juice
would
render
the
meat
insipid
meat
treated
thus
is
juicy
and
when
cooked
as
it
retains
most
of
its
savoury
constituents
on
the
other
hand
if
the
piece
of
meat
be
set
on
the
fire
with
cold
water
and
this
slowly
heated
to
boiling
the
flesh
undergoes
a
loss
of
soluble
and
nutritious
substances
while
as
a
matter
of
course
the
soup
becomes
richer
in
these
matters
the
albumen
is
gradually
dissolved
from
the
surface
to
the
centre
the
fibre
loses
more
or
less
its
quality
of
shortness
or
tenderness
and
becomes
hard
and
tough
the
thinner
the
piece
of
meat
is
the
greater
is
its
loss
of
savoury
constituents
in
order
to
obtain
and
eatable
meat
we
must
relinquish
the
idea
of
making
good
soup
from
it
as
that
mode
of
boiling
which
yields
the
best
soup
gives
the
driest
toughest
and
most
vapid
meat
slow
boiling
whitens
the
meat
and
we
suspect
that
it
is
on
this
account
that
it
is
in
such
favour
with
the
cooks
the
wholesomeness
of
food
is
however
a
matter
of
much
greater
moment
than
the
appearance
it
presents
on
the
table
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
whiteness
of
meat
that
has
been
boiled
slowly
is
produced
by
the
loss
of
some
important
alimentary
properties
the
objections
we
have
raised
to
the
practice
of
putting
meat
on
the
fire
in
cold
water
apply
with
equal
force
to
the
practice
of
soaking
meat
before
cooking
it
which
is
so
strongly
recommended
by
some
cooks
fresh
meat
ought
never
to
be
soaked
as
all
its
most
nutritive
constituents
are
soluble
in
water
soaking
however
is
an
operation
that
can
not
be
entirely
dispensed
with
in
the
preparation
of
animal
food
salted
and
dried
meats
require
to
be
soaked
for
some
time
in
water
before
they
are
cooked
for
boiling
meat
the
softer
the
water
is
the
better
when
spring
water
is
boiled
the
chalk
which
gives
to
it
the
quality
of
hardness
is
precipitated
this
chalk
stains
the
meat
and
communicates
to
it
an
unpleasant
earthy
taste
when
nothing
but
hard
water
can
be
procured
it
should
be
softened
by
boiling
it
for
an
hour
or
two
before
it
is
used
for
culinary
purposes
the
fire
must
be
watched
with
great
attention
during
the
operation
of
boiling
so
that
its
heat
may
be
properly
regulated

does
not
become
hotter
after
it
has
begun
to
boil
however
long
or
with
whatever
violence
the
boiling
is
continued
this
fact
is
of
great
importance
in
cookery
and
attention
to
it
will
save
much
fuel
water
made
to
boil
in
a
gentle
way
by
the
application
of
a
moderate
heat
is
just
as
hot
as
when
it
is
made
to
boil
on
a
strong
fire
with
the
greatest
possible
violence
when
once
water
has
been
brought
to
the
boiling
point
the
fire
may
be
considerably
reduced
as
a
very
gentle
heat
will
suffice
to
keep
the
water
at
its
highest
temperature
the
scum
which
rises
to
the
surface
of
the
pot
during
the
operation
of
boiling
must
be
carefully
removed
otherwise
it
will
attach
itself
to
the
meat
and
thereby
spoil
its
appearance
the
cook
must
not
neglect
to
skim
during
the
whole
process
though
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
scum
rises
at
first
the
practice
of
wrapping
meat
in
a
cloth
may
be
dispensed
with
if
the
skimming
be
skillfully
managed
if
the
scum
be
removed
as
fast
as
it
rises
the
meat
will
be
cooked
clean
and
pure
and
come
out
of
the
vessel
in
which
it
was
boiled
much
more
delicate
and
firm
than
when
cooked
in
a
cloth
when
taken
from
the
pot
the
meat
must
be
wiped
with
a
clean
cloth
or
what
will
be
found
more
convenient
a
sponge
previously
dipped
in
water
and
wrung
dry
the
meat
should
not
be
allowed
to
stand
a
moment
longer
than
necessary
as
boiled
meat
as
well
as
roasted
can
not
be
eaten
too
hot
the
time
allowed
for
the
operation
of
boiling
must
be
regulated
according
to
the
size
and
quality
of
the
meat
as
a
general
rule
twenty
minutes
reckoning
from
the
moment
when
the
boiling
commences
may
be
allowed
for
every
pound
of
meat
all
the
best
authorities
however
agree
in
this
that
the
longer
the
boiling
the
more
perfect
the
operation
a
few
observations
on
the
nutritive
value
of
salted
meat
may
be
properly
introduced
in
this
place
every
housewife
knows
that
dry
salt
in
contact
with
fresh
meat
gradually
becomes
fluid
brine
the
application
of
salt
causes
the
fibres
of
the
meat
to
contract
and
the
juice
to
flow
out
from
its
pores
as
much
as
of
the
juice
of
the
meat
is
often
forced
out
in
this
manner
now
as
this
juice
is
pure
extract
of
meat
containing
albumen
osmazome
and
other
valuable
principles
it
follows
that
meat
which
has
been
preserved
by
the
action
of
salt
can
never
have
the
nutritive
properties
of
fresh
meat
the
vessels
used
for
boiling
should
be
made
of
well
tinned
within
and
provided
with
lids
they
must
be
kept
scrupulously
clean
otherwise
they
will
render
the
meat
cooked
in
them
unsightly
and
unwholesome
copper
pans
if
used
at
all
should
be
reserved
for
operations
that
are
performed
with
rapidity
as
by
long
contact
with
copper
food
may
become
dangerously
contaminated
the
kettle
in
which
a
joint
is
dressed
should
be
large
enough
to
allow
room
for
a
good
supply
of
water
if
the
meat
be
cramped
and
be
surrounded
with
but
little
water

will
be

not
boiled
in
stewing
it
is
not
requisite
to
have
so
great
a
heat
as
in
boiling
a
gentle
simmering
in
a
small
quantity
of
water
so
that
the
meat
is
stewed
almost
in
its
own
juices
is
all
that
is
necessary

method
much
used

that

heated
the
result
of
this
is
the
same
as
that
obtained
in

namely
that
a
crust
so
to
speak
is
formed
outside

thus
the
juices

utensils

but
little
description
the
common
gridiron
for
which
see

at

is
the
same
as
it
has
been
for
ages
past
although
some
little
variety
has
been
introduced
into
its
manufacture
by
the
addition
of
grooves
to
the
bars
by
means
of
which
the
liquid
fat
is
carried
into
a
small
trough
one
point
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
gridiron
should
be
kept
in
a
direction
slanting
towards
the
cook
so
that
as
little
fat
as
possible
may
fall
into
the
fire
it
has
been
observed
that
broiling
is
the
most
difficult
manual
office
the
general
cook
has
to
perform
and
one
that
requires
the
most
unremitting
attention
for
she
may
turn
her
back
upon
the
stewpan
or
the

but
the
gridiron
can
never
be
left
with
impunity

frying
illustration
sauté
pan
this
very
favourite
mode
of
cooking
may
be
accurately
described
as
boiling
in
fat
or
oil
substances
dressed
in
this
way
are
generally
well
received
for
they
introduce
an
agreeable
variety
possessing
as
they
do
a
peculiar
flavour
by
means
of
frying
cooks
can
soon
satisfy
many
requisitions
made
on
them
it
being
a
very
expeditious
mode
of
preparing
dishes
for
the
table
and
one
which
can
be
employed
when
the
fire
is
not
sufficiently
large
for
the
purposes
of
roasting
and
boiling
the
great
point
to
be
borne
in
mind
in
frying
is
that
the
liquid
must
be
hot
enough
to
act
instantaneously
as
all
the
merit
of
this
culinary
operation
lies
in
the
invasion
of
the
boiling
liquid
which
carbonizes
or
burns
at
the
very
instant
of
the
immersion
of
the
body
placed
in
it
it
may
be
ascertained
if
the
fat
is
heated
to
the
proper
degree
by
cutting
a
piece
of
bread
and
dipping
it
in
the
for
five
or
six
seconds
and
if
it
be
firm
and
of
a
dark
brown
when
taken
out
put
in
immediately
what
you
wish
to
prepare
if
it
be
not
let
the
fat
be
heated
until
of
the
right
temperature
this
having
been
effected
moderate
the
fire
so
that
the
action
may
not
be
too
hurried
and
that
by
a
continuous
heat
the
juices
of
the
substance
may
be
preserved
and
its
flavour
enhanced
the
philosophy
of
frying
consists
in
this
that
liquids
subjected
to
the
action
of
fire
do
not
all
receive
the
same
quantity
of
heat
being
differently
constituted
in
their
nature
they
possess
different
capacities
for
caloric
thus
you
may
with
impunity
dip
your
finger
in
boiling
spirits
of
wine
you
would
take
it
very
quickly
from
boiling
brandy
yet
more
rapidly
from
water
whilst
the
effects
of
the
most
rapid
immersion
in
boiling
oil
need
not
be
told
as
a
consequence
of
this
heated
fluids
act
differently
on
the
sapid
bodies
presented
to
them
those
put
in
water
dissolve
and
are
reduced
to
a
soft
mass
the
result
being
stock
no
those
substances
on
the
contrary
treated
with
oil
harden
assume
a
more
or
less
deep
colour
and
are
finally
carbonized
the
reason
of
these
different
results
is
that
in
the
first
instance
water
dissolves
and
extracts
the
interior
juices
of
the
alimentary
substances
placed
in
it
whilst
in
the
second
the
juices
are
preserved
for
they
are
insoluble
in
oil
it
is
to
be
especially
remembered
in
connection
with
frying
that
all
dishes
fried
in
fat
should
be
placed
before
the
fire
on
a
piece
of
or
sieve
reversed
and
there
left
for
a
few
minutes
so
that
any
superfluous
greasy
moisture
may
be
removed
the
utensils
used
for
the
purposes
of
frying
are
confined
to
although
these
are
of
various
sizes

can
scarcely
now
be
considered
a
novelty
many
establishments
both
small
and
large
have
been
fitted
with
apparatus
for
cooking
by
this
mode
which
undoubtedly
exhibits
some
advantages
thus
the
heat
may
be
more
regularly
supplied
to
the
substance
cooking
and
the
operation
is
essentially
a
clean
one
because
there
can
be
no

other
dirt
to
be
provided
for
some
labour
and
attention
necessary

and
besides
this
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
culinary
operations
are
reduced
by
this
means
to
something
like
a
certainty
there
are
however
we
think
many
objections
to
this
mode
of

more
especially
when
applied
to

the

gas
when
the
cooking
operations
are
finished
be
not
turned
off
there
will
be
a
large
increase
in
the
cost
of
cooking
instead
of
the
economy
which
it
has
been
supposed
to
bring
for
large
establishments
such
as
some
of
the
immense
london
warehouses
where
a
large
number
of
young
men
have
to
be
catered
for
daily
it
may
be
well
adapted
as
it
is
just
possible
that
a
slight
increase
in
the
supply
of
gas
necessary
for
a
couple
of
joints
may
serve
equally
to
cook
a
dozen
dishes
roasting
of
the
various
methods
of
preparing
meat
roasting
is
that
which
most
effectually
preserves
its
nutritive
qualities
meat
is
roasted
by
being
exposed
to
the
direct
influence
of
the
fire
this
is
done
by
placing
the
meat
before
an
open
grate
and
keeping
it
in
motion
to
prevent
the
scorching
on
any
particular
part
when
meat
is
properly
roasted
the
outer
layer
of
its
albumen
is
coagulated
and
thus
presents
a
barrier
to
the
exit
of
the
juice
in
roasting
meat
the
heat
must
be
strongest
at
first
and
it
should
then
be
much
reduced
to
have
a
good
juicy
roast
therefore
the
fire
must
be
red
and
vigorous
at
the
very
commencement
of
the
operation
in
the
most
careful
roasting
some
of
the
juice
is
squeezed
out
of
the
meat
this
evaporates
on
the
surface
of
the
meat
and
gives
it
a
dark
brown
colour
a
rich
lustre
and
a
strong
aromatic
taste
besides
these
effects
on
the
albumen
and
the
expelled
juice
roasting
converts
the
cellular
tissue
of
the
meat
into
gelatine
and
melts
the
fat
out
of
the
if
a
spit
is
used
to
support
the
meat
before
the
fire
it
should
be
kept
quite
bright
sand
and
water
ought
to
be
used
to
scour
it
with
for
brickdust
and
oil
may
give
a
disagreeable
taste
to
the
meat
when
well
scoured
it
must
be
wiped
quite
dry
with
a
clean
cloth
and
in
spitting
the
meat
the
prime
parts
should
be
left
untouched
so
as
to
avoid
any
great
escape
of
its
juices
kitchens
in
large
establishments
are
usually
fitted
with
what
are
termed
by
means
of
these
several
spits
if
required
may
be
turned
at
the
same
time
this
not
being
of
course
necessary
in
smaller
establishments
a
roasting
apparatus
more
economical
in
its
consumption
of
coal
is
more
frequently
in
use
illustration
with
wheel
and
hook
the
of
which
we
here
give
an
illustration
with
the
wheel
and
hook
and
showing
the
precise
manner
of
using
it
is
now
commonly
used
in
many
kitchens
this
consists
of
a
spring
inclosed
in
a
brass
cylinder
and
requires
winding
up
before
it
is
used
and
sometimes
also
during
the
operation
of
roasting
the
joint
is
fixed
to
an
iron
hook
which
is
suspended
by
a
chain
connected
with
a
wheel
and
which
in
its
turn
is
connected
with
the
beneath
it
stands
the
which
we
have
also
engraved
together
with
the
the
use
of
which
latter
should
not
be
spared
as
there
can
be
no
good
roast
without
good
basting
spare
the
rod
and
spoil
the
child
might
easily
be
paraphrased
into
spare
the
basting
and
spoil
the
meat
if
the
joint
is
small
and
light
and
so
turns
unsteadily
this
may
be
remedied
by
fixing
to
the
wheel
one
of
the
kitchen
weights
sometimes
this
jack
is
fixed
inside
a
screen
but
there
is
this
objection
to
this
apparatus
that
the
meat
cooked
in
it
resembles
the
flavour
of
baked
meat
this
is
derived
from
its
being
so
completely
surrounded
with
the
tin
that
no
sufficient
current
of
air
gets
to
it
it
will
be
found
preferable
to
make
use
of
a
common
such
as
is
shown
in
the
woodcut
this
contains
shelves
for
warming
plates
and
dishes
and
with
this
the
reflection
not
being
so
powerful
and
more
air
being
admitted
to
the
joint
the
roast
may
be
very
excellently
cooked
illustration
and
in
stirring
the
fire
or
putting
fresh
coals
on
it
the
should
always
be
drawn
back
so
that
there
may
be
no
danger
of
the
coal
cinders
or
ashes
falling
down
into
it
under
each
particular
recipe
there
is
stated
the
time
required
for
roasting
each
joint
but
as
a
general
rule
it
may
be
here
given
that
for
every
pound
of
meat
in
joints
a
quarter
of
an
hour
may
be
allotted
illustration
white
meats
and
the
meat
of
young
animals
require
to
be
very
well
roasted
both
to
be
pleasant
to
the
palate
and
easy
of
digestion
thus
veal
pork
and
lamb
should
be
thoroughly
done
to
the
centre
mutton
and
beef
on
the
other
hand
do
not
generally
speaking
require
to
be
so
thoroughly
done
and
they
should
be
dressed
to
the
point
that
in
carving
them
the
gravy
should
just
run
but
not
too
freely
of
course
in
this
as
in
most
other
dishes
the
tastes
of
individuals
vary
and
there
are
many
who
can
not
partake
with
satisfaction
of
any
joint
unless
it
is
what
others
would
call
overdressed

quadrupeds
chapter
xii
general
observations
on
quadrupeds
by
the
general
assent
of
mankind
the
empire
of
nature
has
been
divided
into
three
kingdoms
the
first
consisting
of
minerals
the
second
of
vegetables
and
the
third
of
animals
the
mineral
kingdom
comprises
all
substances
which
are
without
those
organs
necessary
to
locomotion
and
the
due
performance
of
the
functions
of
life
they
are
composed
of
the
accidental
aggregation
of
particles
which
under
certain
circumstances
take
a
constant
and
regular
figure
but
which
are
more
frequently
found
without
any
definite
conformation
they
also
occupy
the
interior
parts
of
the
earth
as
well
as
compose
those
huge
masses
by
which
we
see
the
land
in
some
parts
guarded
against
the
encroachments
of
the
sea
the
vegetable
kingdom
covers
and
beautifies
the
earth
with
an
endless
variety
of
form
and
colour
it
consists
of
organized
bodies
but
destitute
of
the
power
of
locomotion
they
are
nourished
by
means
of
roots
they
breathe
by
means
of
leaves
and
propagate
by
means
of
seed
dispersed
within
certain
limits
the
animal
kingdom
consists
of
sentient
beings
that
enliven
the
external
parts
of
the
earth
they
possess
the
powers
of
voluntary
motion
respire
air
and
are
forced
into
action
by
the
cravings
of
hunger
or
the
parching
of
thirst
by
the
instincts
of
animal
passion
or
by
pain
like
the
vegetable
kingdom
they
are
limited
within
the
boundaries
of
certain
countries
by
the
conditions
of
climate
and
soil
and
some
of
the
species
prey
upon
each
other
linnaeus
has
divided
them
into
six
classes
mammalia
birds
fishes
amphibious
animals
insects
and
worms
the
three
latter
do
not
come
within
the
limits
of
our
domain
of
fishes
we
have
already
treated
of
birds
we
shall
treat
and
of
mammalia
we
will
now
treat
this
class
of
animals
embraces
all
those
that
nourish
their
young
by
means
of
lacteal
glands
or
teats
and
are
so
constituted
as
to
have
a
warm
or
red
blood
in
it
the
whale
is
placed
an
order
which
from
external
habits
has
usually
been
classed
with
the
fishes
but
although
this
animal
exclusively
inhabits
the
water
and
is
supplied
with
fins
it
nevertheless
exhibits
a
striking
alliance
to
quadrupeds
it
has
warm
blood
and
produces
its
young
alive
it
nourishes
them
with
milk
and
for
that
purpose
is
furnished
with
teats
it
is
also
supplied
with
lungs
and
two
auricles
and
two
ventricles
to
the
heart
all
of
which
bring
it
still
closer
into
an
alliance
with
the
quadrupedal
species
of
the
animal
kingdom
the
general
characteristics
of
the
mammalia
have
been
frequently
noticed
the
bodies
of
nearly
the
whole
species
are
covered
with
hair
a
kind
of
clothing
which
is
both
soft
and
warm
little
liable
to
injury
and
bestowed
in
proportion
to
the
necessities
of
the
animal
and
the
nature
of
the
climate
it
inhabits
in
all
the
higher
orders
of
animals
the
head
is
the
principal
seat
of
the
organs
of
sense
it
is
there
that
the
eyes
the
ears
the
nose
and
the
mouth
are
placed
through
the
last
they
receive
their
nourishment
in
it
are
the
which
in
most
of
the
mammalia
are
used
not
only
for
the
mastication
of
food
but
as
weapons
of
offence
they
are
inserted
into
two
movable
bones
called
jaws
and
the
front
teeth
are
so
placed
that
their
sharp
edges
may
easily
be
brought
in
contact
with
their
food
in
order
that
its
fibres
may
readily
be
separated
next
to
these
on
each
side
are
situated
the
canine
teeth
or
tusks
which
are
longer
than
the
other
teeth
and
being
pointed
are
used
to
tear
the
food
in
the
back
jaws
are
placed
another
form
of
teeth
called
grinders
these
are
for
masticating
the
food
and
in
those
animals
that
live
on
vegetables
they
are
flattened
at
the
top
but
in
carnivora
their
upper
surfaces
are
furnished
with
protuberances
from
the
numbers
form
and
disposition
of
the
teeth
the
various
genera
of
quadrupeds
have
been
arranged
the
is
a
cartilaginous
body
pierced
with
two
holes
which
are
called
nostrils
through
these
the
animal
is
affected
by
the
sense
of
smell
and
in
some
it
is
prominent
whilst
in
others
it
is
flat
compressed
turned
upwards
or
bent
downwards
in
beasts
of
prey
it
is
frequently
longer
than
the
lips
and
in
some
other
animals
it
is
elongated
into
a
movable
trunk
or
proboscis
whilst
in
the
rhinoceros
tribe
it
is
armed
with
a
horn
the
of
quadrupeds
are
generally
defended
by
movable
lids
on
the
outer
margins
of
which
are
fringes
of
hair
called
eyelashes
the
opening
of
the
pupil
is
in
general
circular
but
to
some
species
as
in
those
of
the
cat
and
hare
it
is
contracted
into
a
perpendicular
line
whilst
in
the
horse
the
ox
and
a
few
others
it
forms
a
transverse
bar
the
are
openings
generally
accompanied
with
a
cartilage
which
defends
and
covers
them
called
the
external
ears
in
the
latter
are
wanting
sound
in
them
being
transmitted
merely
through
orifices
in
the
head
which
have
the
name
of
the
most
defenceless
animals
are
extremely
delicate
in
the
sense
of
hearing
as
are
likewise
most
beasts
of
prey
most
of
the
mammiferous
animals
on
four
feet
which
at
the
extremities
are
usually
divided
into
toes
or
fingers
in
some
however
the
feet
end
in
a
single
corneous
substance
called
a
hoof
the
toes
of
a
few
end
in
broad
flat
nails
and
of
most
others
in
pointed
claws
some
again
have
the
toes
connected
by
a
membrane
which
is
adapted
to
those
that
are
destined
to
pass
a
considerable
portion
of
their
lives
in
water
others
again
as
in
the
bat
have
the
digitations
of
the
anterior
feet
greatly
elongated
the
intervening
space
being
filled
by
a
membrane
which
extends
round
the
hinder
legs
and
tail
and
by
means
of
which
they
are
enabled
to
rise
into
the
air
in
man
the
hand
alone
comprises
fingers
separate
free
and
flexible
but
apes
and
some
other
kinds
of
animals
have
fingers
both
to
the
hands
and
feet
these
therefore
are
the
only
animals
that
can
hold
movable
objects
in
a
single
hand
others
such
as
rats
and
squirrels
have
the
fingers
sufficiently
small
and
flexible
to
enable
them
to
pick
up
objects
but
they
are
compelled
to
hold
them
in
both
hands
others
again
have
the
toes
shorter
and
must
rest
on
the
as
is
the
case
with
dogs
and
cats
when
they
wish
to
hold
a
substance
firmly
on
the
ground
with
their
paws
there
are
still
others
that
have
their
toes
united
and
drawn
under
the
skin
or
enveloped
in
corneous
hoofs
and
are
thereby
enabled
to
exercise
no
prehensile
power
whatever
according
to
the
design
and
end
of
nature
mammiferous
animals
are
calculated
when
arrived
at
maturity
to
subsist
on
various
kinds
of
food
some
to
live
wholly
upon
flesh
others
upon
grain
herbs
or
fruits
but
in
their
infant
state
milk
is
the
appropriate
food
of
the
whole
that
this
food
may
never
fail
them
it
is
universally
ordained
that
the
young
should
no
sooner
come
into
the
world
than
the
milk
should
flow
in
abundance
into
the
members
with
which
the
mother
is
supplied
for
the
secretion
of
that
nutritious
fluid
by
a
wonderful
instinct
of
nature
too
the
young
animal
almost
as
soon
as
it
has
come
into
life
searches
for
the
teat
and
knows
perfectly
at
the
first
how
by
the
process
of
suction
it
will
be
able
to
extract
the
fluid
necessary
to
its
existence
in
the
general
economy
of
nature
this
class
of
animals
seems
destined
to
preserve
a
constant
equilibrium
in
the
number
of
animated
beings
that
hold
their
existence
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
to
man
they
are
immediately
useful
in
various
ways
some
of
their
bodies
afford
him
food
their
skin
shoes
and
their
fleece
clothes
some
of
them
unite
with
him
in
participating
the
dangers
of
combat
with
an
enemy
and
others
assist
him
in
the
chase
in
exterminating
wilder
sorts
or
banishing
them
from
the
haunts
of
civilization
many
indeed
are
injurious
to
him
but
most
of
them
in
some
shape
or
other
he
turns
to
his
service
of
these
there
is
none
he
has
made
more
subservient
to
his
purposes
than
the
common
ox
of
which
there
is
scarcely
a
part
that
he
has
not
been
able
to
convert
into
some
useful
purpose
of
the
horns
he
makes
combs
and
boxes
and
when
they
are
softened
by
means
of
boiling
water
he
fashions
them
into
transparent
plates
for
lanterns
this
invention
is
ascribed
to
king
alfred

is
said
to
have
been
the
first
to

great
britain
has

distinguished
for
the
excellence
of
her
native
breeds
of
cattle
and
there
are
none
in
england
that
have
obtained
greater
celebrity
than
those
which
have
this
name
and
which
originated
about
seventy
years
ago
on
the
banks
of
the
tees
thence
they
have
spread
into
the
valleys
of
the
tweed
thence
to
the
lothians
in
scotland
and
southward
into
the
fine
pastures
of
england
they
are
now
esteemed
the
most
profitable
breed
of
cattle
as
there
is
no
animal
which
attains
sooner
to
maturity
and
none
that
supplies
meat
of
a
superior
quality
the
value
of
some
of
the
improved
breeds
is
something
enormous
at
the
sale
of
charles
colling
a
breeder
in
yorkshire
in
his
bull
comet
sold
for
guineas
at
the
sale
of
earl
spencer
herd
in
cows
heifers
and
calves
with
nineteen
bulls
fetched
being
an
average
of
apiece
the
value
of
such
animals
is
scarcely
to
be
estimated
by
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
the
care
with
which
they
are
tended
and
with
the
anxious
attention
which
is
paid
to
the
purity
of
their
breed
a
modern
writer
well
acquainted
with
this
subject
says
there
are
now
at
least
five
hundred
herds
large
and
small
in
this
kingdom
and
from
six
to
seven
thousand
head
registered
every
alternate
year
in
the
the
necessity
for
thus
recording
the
breeds
is
greater
than
might
at
first
sight
be
imagined
as
it
tends
directly
to
preserve
the
character
of
the
cattle
while
it
sometimes

the

takes
a

place
not

on

resembles

the
excellence

derived

showing

the
general
mode
of
slaughtering
oxen
in
this
country
is
by
striking
them
a
smart
blow
with
a
hammer
or
poleaxe
on
the
head
a
little
above
the
eyes
by
this
means
when
the
blow
is
skilfully
given
the
beast
is
brought
down
at
one
blow
and
to
prevent
recovery
a
cane
is
generally
inserted
by
which
the
spinal
cord
is
perforated
which
instantly
deprives
the
ox
of
all
sensation
of
pain
in
spain
and
some
other
countries
on
the
continent
it
is
also
usual
to
deprive
oxen
of
life
by
the
operation
of
pithing
or
dividing
the
spinal
cord
in
the
neck
close
to
the
back
part
of
the
head
this
is
in
effect
the
same
mode
as
is
practised
in
the
celebrated
spanish
by
the
matador
and
it
is
instantaneous
in
depriving
the
animal
of
sensation
if
the
operator
be
skilful
we
hope
and
believe
that
those
men
whose
disagreeable
duty
it
is
to
slaughter
the
beasts
of
the
field
to
provide
meat
for
mankind
inflict
as
little
punishment
and
cause
as
little
suffering
as
possible

is

at

as

will
be
impregnated
with
the
flavour
of
those
boiled
with
the
meat
the
action
of
salt
on
the
manner
in
which
salt
acts
in
preserving
meat
is
not
difficult
to
understand
by
its
strong
affinity
it
in
the
first
place
extracts
the
juices
from
the
substance
of
meat
in
sufficient
quantity
to
form
a
saturated
solution
with
the
water
contained
in
the
juice
and
the
meat
then
absorbs
the
saturated
brine
in
place
of
the
juice
extracted
by
the
salt
in
this
way
matter
incapable
of
putrefaction
takes
the
places
of
that
portion
in
the
meat
which
is
most
perishable
such
however
is
not
the
only
office
of
salt
as
a
means
of
preserving
meat
it
acts
also
by
its
astringency
in
contracting
the
fibres
of
the
muscles
and
so
excludes
the
action
of
air
on
the
interior
of
the
substance
of
the
meat
the
operation
of
salt
as
an
antiseptic
is
evinced
by
the
diminution
of
the
volume
of
meat
to
which
it
is
applied
the
astringent
action
of
on
meat
is
much
greater
than
that
of
salt
and
thereby
renders
meat
to
which
it
is
applied
very
hard
but
in
small
quantities
it
considerably
assists
the
antiseptic
action
of
salt
and
also
prevents
the
destruction
of
the
florid
colour
of
meat
which
is
caused
by
the
application
of
salt
thus
it
will
be
perceived
from
the
foregoing
statement
that
the
application
of
salt
and
saltpetre
diminishes
in
a
considerable
degree
the
nutritive
and
to
some
extent
the
wholesome
qualities
of
meat
and
therefore
in
their
use
the
quantity
applied
should
be
as
small
as
possible

the
perfect

if

if

all

the
tails
of
in
the
class
mammalia
the
vertebral
column
or
backbone
presents
only
slight
modifications
and
everywhere
shows
the
same
characteristics
as
in
man
who
stands
at
the
head
of
this
division
of
the
animal
kingdom
the
length
of
this
column
however
varies
much
and
the
number
of
vertebrae
of
which
it
is
composed
is
far
from
being
uniform
these
numerical
differences
principally
depend
on
the
unequal
development
of
the
caudal
portion
or
of
the
column
thus
the
vertebrae
sometimes
do
not
exist
at
all
amongst
certain
bats
for
example
in
other
instances
we
reckon
forty
fifty
and
even
upwards
of
sixty
of
these
bones
among
the
greater
number
of
mammals
the
tail
is
of
little
use
for
locomotion
except
that
it
acts
in
many
cases
as
does
the
rudder
of
a
ship
steadying
the
animal
in
his
rapid
movements
and
enabling
him
to
turn
more
easily
and
quickly
among
some
animals
it
becomes
a
very
powerful
instrument
of
progression
thus
in
the
kangaroos
and
jerboas
the
tail
forms
with
the
hind
feet
a
kind
of
tripod
from
which
the
animal
makes
its
spring
with
most
of
the
american
monkeys
it
is
prehensile
and
serves
the
animal
as
a
fifth
hand
to
suspend
itself
from
the
branches
of
trees
and
lastly
among
the
whales
it
grows
to
an
enormous
size

french
it
has
been
all
but
universally
admitted
that
the
beef
of
france
is
greatly
inferior
in
quality
to
that
of
england
owing
to
inferiority
of
pasturage
curmer
however
one
of
the
latest
writers
on
the
culinary
art
tells
us
that
this
is
a
vulgar
error
and
that
french
beef
is
far
superior
to
that
of
england
this
is
mere
vaunting
on
the
part
of
our
neighbours
who
seem
to
want
in
everything
and
we
should
not
deign
to
notice
it
if
it
had
occurred
in
a
work
of
small
pretensions

curmer
book
professes
to
be
a
complete
exposition
of
the
scientific
principles
of
cookery
and
holds
a
high
rank
in
the
didactic
literature
of
france
we
half
suspect
that
curmer
obtained
his
knowledge
of
english
beef
in
the
same
way

did
the
poor
frenchman
whom
the
late
mathews
the
comedian
so
humorously
described

has
thus
revived
the
story
of
the
son
of

a
frenchman
was
one
day
blandly
remonstrating
against
the
supercilious
scorn
expressed
by
englishmen
for
the
beef
of
france
which
he
for
his

did
not
find
so
inferior

origin
of
the
word
sirloin
the
loin
of
beef
is
said
to
have
been
knighted
by
king
charles
at
friday
hall
chingford
the
merry
monarch
returned
to
this
hospitable
mansion
for
epping
forest
literally
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
and
beheld
with
delight
a
huge
loin
of
beef
steaming
upon
the
table
a
noble
joint
exclaimed
the
king
by
george
it
shall
have
a
title
then
drawing
his
sword
he
raised
it
above
the
meat
and
cried
with
mock
dignity
loin
we
dub
thee
knight
henceforward
be
sir
loin
this
anecdote
is
doubtless
apocryphal
although
the
oak
table
upon
which
the
joint
was
supposed
to
have
received
its
knighthood
might
have
been
seen
by
any
one
who
visited
house
a
few
years
ago
it
is
perhaps
a
pity
to
spoil
so
noble
a
story
but
the
interests
of
truth
demand
that
we
declare
that
is
probably
a
corruption
of
which
signifies
the
upper
part
of
a
loin
the
prefix
being
equivalent
to
or
in
french
we
find
this
joint
called

so
closely
resembles

baking
exerts

unexplained
influence
on

than

which
has
been
roasted
those
who
have
travelled
in
germany
and
france
writes
lewis
one
of
our
most
popular
scientific
authors
must
have
repeatedly
marvelled
at
the
singular
uniformity
in
the
flavour
or
want
of
flavour
of
the
various
served
up
at
the
the
general
explanation
is
that
the
german
and
french
meat
is
greatly
inferior
in
quality
to
that
of
england
and
holland
owing
to
the
inferiority
of
pasturage
and
doubtless
this
is
one
cause
but
it
is
not
the
chief
cause
the
meat
is
inferior
but
the
cooking
is
mainly
at
fault
the
meat
is
scarcely
ever
because
there
is
no
coal
and
firewood
is
expensive
the
meat
is
therefore
and
the
consequence
of
this
baking
is
that
no
meat
is
eatable
or
eaten
with
its
own
gravy
but
is
always
accompanied
by
some
sauce
more
or
less
piquant

sir
walter
scott
has
described
a
feast
at
which
the
baron
of
beef
would
have
appeared
to
great
advantage
we
will
quote
a
few
lines
to
remind
us
of
those
days
when
england
was
merry
england
and
when
hospitality
was
thought
to
be
the
highest
virtue
the
fire
with
logs
supplied
went
roaring
up
the
chimney
wide
the
huge
oaken
face
scrubb
till
it
shone
the
day
to
grace
bore
then
upon
its
massive
board
no
mark
to
part
the
squire
and
lord
then
was
brought
in
the
lusty
brawn
by
old
then
the
grim
boar
head
frown
on
high
crested
with
bays
and
rosemary
well
can
the
ranger
tell
how
when
and
where
the
monster
fell
what
dogs
before
his
death
he
tore
and
all
the
baiting
of
the
boar
while
round
the
merry

fail
old

to
produce
at
such
high
tide
her

when
a
lord
son
came
of
age
in
the
olden
time
the
baron
of
beef
was
too
small
a
joint
by
many
degrees
to
satisfy
the
retainers
who
would
flock
to
the
hall
a
whole
ox
was
therefore
generally
roasted
over
a
fire
built
up
of
huge

may

may

there
is
but
little
description
necessary
to
add
to
show
the
carving
of
a
boiled
brisket
of
beef
beyond
the
engraving
here
inserted
the
only
point
to
be
observed
is
that
the
joint
should
be
cut
evenly
and
firmly
quite
across
the
bones
so
that
on
its
reappearance
at
table
it
should
not
have
a
jagged
and
untidy
look
illustration
ribs
of
beef
this
dish
resembles
the
sirloin
except
that
it
has
no
fillet
or
undercut
as
explained
in
the
recipes
the
end
piece
is
often
cut
off
salted
and
boiled
the
mode
of
carving
is
similar
to
that
of
the
sirloin
in
the
direction
of
the
dotted
line
from
to
this
joint
will
be
the
more
easily
cut
if
the
plan
be
pursued
which
is
suggested
in
carving
the
sirloin
namely
the
inserting
of
the
knife
immediately
between
the
bone
and
the
moat
before
commencing
to
cut
it
into
slices
all
joints
of
roast
beef
should
be
cut
in
even
and
thin
slices
horseradish
finely
scraped
may
be
served
as
a
garnish
but
horseradish
sauce
is
preferable
for
eating
with
the
beef
illustration
sirloin

this
dish
is
served
differently
at
various
tables
some
preferring
it
to

it
is
usually
called
the

the
reverse
way
as
shown
in
the
cut
is
that
most
usually
adopted
still
the
undercut
is
best
eaten
when
hot
consequently
the
carver
himself
may
raise
the
joint
and
cut
some
slices
from
the
under
side
in
the
direction
of
from
to
as
the
fillet
is
very
much
preferred
by
some
eaters
the
upper
part
of
the
sirloin
should
be
cut
in
the
direction
of
the
line
from
to
and
care
should
be
taken
to
carve
it
evenly
and
in
thin
slices
it
will
be
found
a
great
assistance
in
carving
this
joint
well
if
the
knife
be
first
inserted
just
above
the
bone
at
the
bottom
and
run
sharply
along
between
the
bone
and
meat
and
also
to
divide
the
meat
from
the
bone
in
the
same
way
at
the
side
of
the
joint
the
slices
will
then
come
away
more
readily

carvers

the
upper
side
of

plan

the

that

soothing
contentment
to
the
heart
are
elicited
from
the
musical
strings
prepared
almost
exclusively
from
the
intestines
of

valuable

the

the

inattention
with
which

the
great
object
of

is
to

that

the
system
adopted
by
the

is
to

the
mental

those
that
can
and
as
nothing
militates
against
the
fattening
process
so
much
as
restlessness
the
chief
wish
of
the
grazier
is
to
find
a
dull
indolent
sheep
one
who
instead
of
frisking
himself
leaping
his
wattles
or
even
condescending
to
notice
the
butting
gambols
of
his
silly
companions
silently
fills
his
paunch
with
pasture
and
then
seeking
a
shady
nook
indolently
and
luxuriously
chows
his
cud
with
closed
eyes
and
blissful
satisfaction
only
rising
when
his
delicious
repast
is
ended
to
proceed
silently
and
without
emotion
to
repeat
the
pleasing
process
of
laying
in
more
provender
and
then
returning
to
his
dreamy
siesta
to
renew
the
delightful
task
of
rumination
such
animals
are
said
to
have
a
temperament
and
are
of
so
kindly
a
nature
that
on
good
pasturage
they
may
be
said
to
grow
daily
the
leicestershire
breed
is
the
best
example
of
this
lymphatic
and
contented
animal
and
the
active
orkney
who
is
half
goat
in
his
habits
of
the
restless
and
unprofitable
the
rich
pasture
of
our
midland
counties
would
take
years
in
making
the
wiry
orkney
fat
and
profitable
while
one
day
fatigue
in
climbing
rocks
after
a
coarse
and
scanty
herbage
would
probably
cause
the
actual
death
of
the
pampered
and
leicester
the
more
removed
from
the
nature
of
the
animal
is
the
food
on
which
it
lives
the
more
difficult
is
the
process
of
assimilation
and
the
more
complex
the
chain
of
digestive
organs
for
it
must
be
evident
to
all
that
the
same
apparatus
that
converts
into
is
hardly
calculated
to
transmute
into
flesh
as
the
process
of
digestion
in
carnivorous
animals
is
extremely
simple
these
organs
are
found
to
be
remarkably
short
seldom
exceeding
the
length
of
the
animal
body
while
where
digestion
is
more
difficult
from
the
unassimilating
nature
of
the
aliment
as
in
the
ruminant
order
the
alimentary
canal
as
is
the
case
with
the
sheep
is
times
the
length
of
the
the
digestive
organ
in
all
ruminant
animals
consists
of
or
rather
a
capacious
pouch
divided
by
doorways
and
valves
into
four
compartments
called
in
their
order
of
position
the
paunch
the
reticulum
the
omasum
and
the
abomasum
when
the
sheep
nibbles
the
grass
and
is
ignorantly
supposed
to
be
eating
he
is
in
fact
only
preparing
the
raw
material
of
his
meal
in
reality
only
mowing
the
pasture
which
as
he
collects
is
swallowed
instantly
passing
into
the
first
receptacle
the
where
it
is
surrounded
by
a
quantity
of
warm
saliva
in
which
the
herbage
undergoes
a
process
of
maceration
or
softening
till
the
animal
having
filled
this
compartment
the
contents
pass
through
a
valve
into
the
second
or
smaller
bag
the
where
having
again
filled
the
paunch
with
a
reserve
the
sheep
lies
down
and
commences
that
singular
process
of
chewing
the
cud
or
in
other
words
masticating
the
food
he
has
collected
by
the
operation
of
a
certain
set
of
muscles
a
small
quantity
of
this
softened
food
from
the
or
second
bag
is
passed
into
the
mouth
which
it
now
becomes
the
pleasure
of
the
sheep
to
grind
under
his
molar
teeth
into
a
soft
smooth
pulp
the
operation
being
further
assisted
by
a
flow
of
saliva
answering
the
double
purpose
of
increasing
the
flavour
of
the
aliment
and
promoting
the
solvency
of
the
mass
having
completely
comminuted
and
blended
this
mouthful
it
is
swallowed
a
second
time
but
instead
of
returning
to
the
paunch
or
reticulum
it
passes
through
another
valve
into
a
side
cavity
the
where
after
a
maceration
in
more
saliva
for
some
hours
it
glides
by
the
same
contrivance
into
the
fourth
pouch
the
an
apartment
in
all
respects
analogous
to
the
ordinary
stomach
of
animals
and
where
the
process
of
digestion
begun
and
carried
on
in
the
previous
three
is
here
consummated
and
the
nutrient
principle
by
means
of
the
bile
eliminated
from
the
digested
aliment
such
is
the
process
of
digestion
in
sheep
and
oxen
no
other
animal
even
of
the
same
order
possesses
in
so
remarkable
a
degree
the
power
of
converting
pasture
into
flesh
as
the
leicestershire
sheep
the
south
down
and
cheviot
the
two
next
breeds
in
quality
are
in
consequence
of
the
greater
vivacity
of
the
nature
not
equal
to
it
in
that
respect
though
in
both
the
brain
and
chest
are
kept
subservient
to
the
greater
capacity
of
the
organs
of
digestion
besides
the
advantage
of
increased
bulk
and
finer
fleeces
the
breeder
seeks
to
obtain
an
augmented
deposit
of
tissue
in
those
parts
of
the
carcase
most
esteemed
as
food
or
what
are
called
in
the
trade
prime
joints
and
so
far
has
this
been
effected
that
the
comparative
weight
of
the
hind
quarters
over
the
fore
has
become
a
test
of
quality
in
the
breed
the
butchers
in
some
markets
charging
twopence
a
pound
more
for
that
portion
of
the
sheep
indeed
so
superior
are
the
hind
quarters
of
mutton
now
regarded
that
very
many
of
the
butchers
never
deal
in
any
other
part
of
the
sheep
the
difference
in
the
quality
of
the
flesh
in
various
breeds
is
a
fact
not
alone
in
flavour
but
also
in
tenderness
and
that
the
nature
of
the
pasture
on
which
the
sheep
is
fed
influences
the
flavour
of
the
meat
is
equally
certain
and
shown
in
the
estimation
in
which
those
flocks
are
held
which
have
grazed
on
the
thymy
heath
of
bamstead
in
sussex
it
is
also
a
truth
that
the
the
frame
of
the
animal
the
is
the
meat
and
that
are
both
guarantees
for
the
fineness
of
the
breed
and
the
delicacy
of
the
flesh
the
sex
too
has
much
to
do
in
determining
the
quality
of
the
meat
in
the
males
the
lean
is
closer
in
fibre
deeper
in
colour
harder
in
texture
less
juicy
and
freer
from
fat
than
in
the
female
and
is
consequently
tougher
and
more
difficult
of
digestion
but
probably
age
and
the
character
of
the
pasturage
on
which
they
are
reared
has
more
than
any
other
cause
an
influence
on
the
quality
and
tenderness
of
the
meat
the
numerous
varieties
of
sheep
inhabiting
the
different
regions
of
the
earth
have
been
reduced
by
cuvier
to
three
or
at
most
four
species
the
or
the
argali
the
presumed
parent
stock
of
all
the
rest
the
the
bearded
sheep
of
africa
the
the
musmon
of
southern
europe
and
the
the
mouflon
of
america
though
it
is
believed
by
many
naturalists
that
this
last
is
so
nearly
identical
with
the
indian
argali
as
to
be
undeserving
a
separate
place
it
is
still
a
controversy
to
which
of
these
three
we
are
indebted
for
the
many
breeds
of
modern
domestication
the
argali
however
by
general
belief
has
been
considered
as
the
most
progenitor
of
the
present
varieties
the
effects
produced
by
change
of
climate
accident
and
other
causes
must
have
been
great
to
accomplish
so
complete
a
physical
alteration
as
the
primitive
argali
must
have
undergone
before
the
musmon
or
mouflon
of
corsica
the
progenitor
of

our
european
breeds
assumed
his
present
appearance
the

a

a
native
of

the

range
of
light
chalky
hills
running
through
the

known
as

been
famous
for

find

peculiar

for
size

thickness

quantity
of

and
what

called
thickness
of

on
this
account

ages
held
over

so
satisfied

the

men
with

superiority
of

stock

proved
in
an
eminent
degree
the
advantage
of

though

smaller

original
it
was
found
that
the
new
stock
did
not
consume
so
much
food
the
stocking
was
increased
they
were
ready
for

market

the

formed
more

it
was

most
advantage
to
the
grazier
rather
than
as
formerly
in

interior

it
went
to
the
butcher
as
offal

breast
the
haunch
of
mutton
so
often
served
at
public
dinners
and
special
entertainments
comprises
all
the
leg
and
so
much
of
the
loin
short
of
the
ribs
or
lap
as
is
indicated
on
the
upper
part
of
the
carcase
by
a
dotted
line
the
gentle
and
timid
disposition
of
the
sheep
and
its
defenceless
condition
must
very
early
have
attached
it
to
man
for
motives
less
selfish
than
either
its
fleece
or
its
flesh
for
it
has
been
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
obtuse
as
we
generally
regard
it
it
is
susceptible
of
a
high
degree
of
domesticity
obedience
and
affection
in
many
parts
of
europe
where
the
flocks
are
guided
by
the
shepherd
voice
alone
it
is
no
unusual
thing
for
a
sheep
to
quit
the
herd
when
called
by
its
name
and
follow
the
keeper
like
a
dog
in
the
mountains
of
scotland
when
a
flock
is
invaded
by
a
savage
dog
the
rams
have
been
known
to
form
the
herd
into
a
circle
and
placing
themselves
on
the
outside
line
keep
the
enemy
at
bay
or
charging
on
him
in
a
troop
have
despatched
him
with
their
horns
the
value
of
the
sheep
seems
to
have
been
early
understood
by
adam
in
his
fallen
state
his
skin
not
only
affording
him
protection
for
his
body
but
a
covering
for
his
tent
and
accordingly
we
find
abel
intrusted
with
this
portion
of
his
father
stock
for
the
bible
tells
us
that
abel
was
a
keeper
of
sheep
what
other
animals
were
domesticated
at
that
time
we
can
only
conjecture
or
at
what
exact
period
the
flesh
of
the
sheep
was
first
eaten
for
food
by
man
is
equally
if
not
uncertain
open
to
controversy
for
though
some
authorities
maintain
the
contrary
it
is
but
natural
to
suppose
that
when
abel
brought
firstlings
of
his
flock
and
the
fat
thereof
as
a
sacrifice
the
less
dainty
portions
not
being
oblations
were
hardly
likely
to
have
been
flung
away
as
refuse
indeed
without
supposing
adam
and
his
descendants
to
have
eaten
animal
food
we
can
not
reconcile
the
fact
of
jubal
cain
cain
son
and
his
family
living
in
tents
as
they
are
reported
to
have
done
knowing
that
both
their
own
garments
and
the
coverings
of
the
tents
were
made
from
the
hides
and
skins
of
the
animals
they
bred
for
the
number
of
sheep
and
oxen
slain
for
oblations
only
would
not
have
supplied
sufficient
material
for
two
such
necessary
purposes
the
opposite
opinion
is
that
animal
food
was
not
eaten
till
after
the
flood
when
the
lord
renewed
his
covenant
with
noah
from
scriptural
authority
we
learn
many
interesting
facts
as
regards
the
sheep
the
first
that
mutton
fat
was
considered
the
most
delicious
portion
of
any
meat
and
the
tail
and
adjacent
part
the
most
exquisite
morsel
in
the
whole
body
consequently
such
were
regarded
as
especially
fit
for
the
offer
of
sacrifice
from
this
fact
we
may
reasonably
infer
that
the
animal
still
so
often
met
with
in
palestine
and
syria
and
known
as
the
sheep
was
in
use
in
the
days
of
the
patriarchs
though
probably
not
then
of
the
size
and
weight
it
now
attains
to
a
supposition
that
gains
greater
strength
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
ram
abraham
found
in
the
bush
when
he
went
to
offer
up
isaac
was
a
horned
animal
being
entangled
in
the
brake
by
his
curved
horns
so
far
proving
that
it
belonged
to
the
tribe
of
the
capridae

to
the

dependence
upon

for

is
frequently
referred

himself
to

to
seek

servant

despatching
his
twelve
chosen
disciples

by
which

many
passages
in
holy
writ
enable
us
to
appreciate
the
pastoral
riches
of
the
first
eastern
nations
and
we
can
form
an
idea
of
the
number
of
their
flocks
when
we
read
that
jacob
gave
the
children
of
hamor
a
hundred
sheep
for
the
price
of
a
field
and
that
the
king
of
israel
received
a
hundred
thousand
every
year
from
the
king
of
moab
his
tributary
and
a
like
number
of
rams
covered
with
their
fleece
the
tendency
which
most
sheep
have
to
ramble
renders
it
necessary
for
them
to
be
attended
by
a
shepherd
to
keep
a
flock
within
bounds
is
no
easy
task
but
the
watchful
shepherd
manages
to
accomplish
it
without
harassing
the
sheep
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
where
the
herbage
is
scanty
the
requires
to
be
very
large
and
to
be
watched
over
by
many
shepherds

of

of

scottish
landowners

the
ancient
fable
of
the
golden
fleece
may
be
thus
briefly
told
phryxus
a
son
of
athamus
king
of
thebes
to
escape
the
persecutions
of
his
stepmother
ino
paid
a
visit
to
his
friend
aeetes
king
of
colchis
a
ram
whose
fleece
was
of
pure
gold
carried
the
youth
through
the
air
in
a
most
obliging
manner
to
the
court
of
his
friend
when
safe
at
colchis
phryxus
offered
the
ram
on
the
altars
of
mars
and
pocketed
the
fleece
the
king
received
him
with
great
kindness
and
gave
him
his
daughter
chalciope
in
marriage
but
some
time
after
he
murdered
him
in
order
to
obtain
possession
of
the
precious
fleece
the
murder
of
phryxus
was
amply
revenged
by
the
greeks
it
gave
rise
to
the
famous
argonautic
expedition
undertaken
by
jason
and
fifty
of
the
most
celebrated
heroes
of
greece
the
argonauts
recovered
the
fleece
by
the
help
of
the
celebrated
sorceress
medea
daughter
of
aeetes
who
fell
desperately
in
love
with
the
gallant
but
faithless
jason
in
the
story
of
the
voyage
of
the
argo
a
substratum
of
truth
probably
exists
though
overlaid
by
a
mass
of
fiction
the
ram
which
carried
phryxus
to
colchis
is
by
some
supposed
to
have
been
the
name
of
the
ship
in
which
he
embarked
the
fleece
of
gold
is
thought
to
represent
the
immense
treasures
he
bore
away
from
thebes
the
alchemists
of
the
fifteenth
century
were
firmly
convinced
that
the
golden
fleece
was

treatise

the

seems
to
have
been
the
first
employment
of
mankind
and
the
most
ancient
sort
of
poetry
was
probably
pastoral
the
poem
known
as
the
pastoral
gives
a
picture
of
the
life
of
the
simple
shepherds
of
the
golden
age
who
are
supposed
to
have
beguiled
their
time
in
singing
in

pastorals
repeated
allusions
are
made
to
the
fleecy
flocks
the
lambs
and
the
tender
ewes
indeed
the
sheep
occupy
a
position
in
these
poems
inferior
only
to
that
of
the
shepherds
who
tend
them

nibbling
sheep
has
ever
been
a
favourite
of
the
poets

has
supplied
them

figures

similes

touchingly
speaks
of
his
helplessness

flies
the
reckless
shepherd
from

the
harmless

doth
yield

comparison

thou

thy

another
proof

taught

loin

there
is
one
point
in
connection
with
carving
a
loin
of
mutton
which
includes
every
other
that
is
that
the
joint
should
be
thoroughly
well
jointed
by
the
butcher
before
it
is
cooked
this
knack
of
jointing
requires
practice
and
the
proper
tools
and
no
one
but
the
butcher
is
supposed
to
have
these
if
the
bones
be
not
well
jointed
the
carving
of
a
loin
of
mutton
is
not
a
gracious
business
whereas
if
that
has
been
attended
to
it
is
an
easy
and
untroublesome
task
the
knife
should
be
inserted
at
fig
and
after
feeling
your
way
between
the
bones
it
should
be
carried
sharply
in
the
direction
of
the
line
to
as
there
are
some
people
who
prefer
the
outside
cut
while
others
do
not
like
it
the
question
as
to
their
choice
of
this
should
be
asked

we
have
heard
at
various
intervals
growlings
expressed
at
the
inevitable

our
middle
classes
yet
we
doubt
whether
any
other
joint
is
better
liked
when
it
has
been
well
hung
and
artistically
cooked
there
is
a
diversity
of
opinion
respecting
the
mode
of
sending
this
joint
to
table

it
has
only
reference
to
whether
or
no
there
shall
be
any
portion

the

if
so
how
many
joints

we
ourselves
prefer

patronized

direction

until
the
bone
of
the
shoulder
is
reached
as
many
slices
as
can
be
carved
in
this
manner
should
be
taken
and
afterwards
the
meat
lying

side

be
served

direction

to
and
to
the
uppermost

shoulder
being
now
finished
the
joint
should
be
turned
and
slices
taken
off
along
its
whole
length
there
are
some
who
prefer
this
of
the
shoulder
for
its
juicy
flesh
although
the
grain
of
the
meat
is
not
so
fine
as
that
on
the
other
side
of
lamb
illustration

we
always
think
that
a
good
and
practised
carver
delights
in
the
manipulation
of
this
joint
for
there
is
a
little
field
for
his
judgment
and
dexterity
which
does
not
always
occur
the
separation
of
the
shoulder
from
the
breast
is
the
first
point
to
be
attended
to
this
is
done
by
passing
the
knife
lightly
round
the
dotted
line
as
shown
by
the
figures
and
so
as
to
cut
through
the
skin
and
then
by
raising
with
a
little
force
the
shoulder
into
which
the
fork
should
be
firmly
fixed
it
will
come
away
with
just
a
little
more
exercise
of
the
knife
in
dividing
the
shoulder
and
breast
the
carver
should
take
care
not
to
cut
away
too
much
of
the
meat
from
the
latter
as
that
would
rather
spoil
its
appearance
when
the
shoulder
is
removed
the
breast
and
shoulder
being
separated
it
is
usual
to
lay
a
small
piece
of
butter
and
sprinkle
a
little
cayenne
and
salt
between
them
and
when
this
is
melted
and
incorporated
with
the
meat
and
gravy
the
shoulder
may
as
more
convenient
be
removed
into
another
dish
the
next
operation
is
to
separate
the
ribs
from

brisket

cutting
through

general
observations
on
the
common
hog
the
hog
belongs
to
the
order
the
genus
and
the
species
or
and
its
generic
characters
are
a
small
head
with
long
flexible
snout
truncated
teeth
divided
into
upper
incisors
converging
lower
incisors
projecting
upper
and
lower
canine
or
tusks
the
former
short
the
latter
projecting
formidable
and
sharp
and
molars
in
each
jaw
cloven
feet
furnished
with
toes
and
tail
small
short
and
twisted
while
in
some
varieties
this
appendage
is
altogether
wanting
from
the
number
and
position
of
the
teeth
physiologists
are
enabled
to
define
the
nature
and
functions
of
the
animal
and
from
those
of
the
or
hog
it
is
evident
that
he
is
as
much
a
as
a
or
can
live
as
well
on
vegetable
as
on
animal
food
though
a
mixture
of
both
is
plainly
indicated
as
the
character
of
food
most
conducive
to
the
integrity
and
health
of
its
physical
system
thus
the
pig
tribe
though
not
a
ruminating
mammal
as
might
be
inferred
from
the
number
of
its
molar
teeth
is
yet
a
link
between
the
and
the
tribes
and
is
consequently
what
is
known
as
an
quadruped
or
in
other
words
capable
of
converting
any
kind
of
aliment
into
nutriment
though
the
hoof
in
the
hog
is
as
a
general
rule
cloven
there
are
several
remarkable
exceptions
as
in
the
species
native
to
norway
illyria
sardinia
and
to
the
berkshire
variety
of
the
british
domesticated
pig
in
which
the
hoof
is
entire
and
whatever
difference
in
its
physical
nature
climate
and
soil
may
produce
in
this
animal
his
functional
characteristics
are
the
same
in
whatever
part
of
the
world
he
may
be
found
and
whether
in
the
trackless
forests
of
south
america
the
coral
isles
of
polynesia
the
jungles
of
india
or
the
spicy
brakes
of

the

turn
with

gusto
to

offal

it
is
this
coarse
and
repulsive
mode
of
feeding
that
has
in
every
country
and
language
obtained
for
him
the
opprobrium
of
being
an
unclean
animal
in
the
mosaical
law
the
pig
is
condemned
as
an
unclean
beast
and
consequently
interdicted
to
the
israelites
as
unfit
for
human
food
and
the

strict
however
as
the
law
was
respecting
the

animals
the
jews
with
their
usual
perversity
and
violation
of
the
divine
commands
seem
afterwards
to
have
ignored
the
prohibition
for
unless
they
ate
pork
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
for
what
purpose
they
kept
troves
of
swine
as
from
the
circumstance
recorded
in
matthew
xviii
when
jesus
was
in
galilee
and
the
devils
cast
out
of
the
two
men
were
permitted
to
enter
the
herd
of
swine
that
were
feeding
on
the
hills
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sea
of
tiberias
it
is
very
evident
they
did
there
is
only
one
interpretation
by
which
we
can
account
for
a
prohibition
that
debarred
the
jews
from
so
many
foods
which
we
regard
as
nutritious
luxuries
that
being
fat
and
the
texture
more
hard
of
digestion
than
other
meats
they
were
likely
in
a
hot
dry
climate
where
vigorous
exercise
could
seldom
be
taken
to
produce
disease
and
especially
cutaneous
affections
indeed
in
this
light
as
a
code
of
sanitary
ethics
the
book
of
leviticus
is
the
most
admirable
system
of
moral
government
ever
conceived
for
man
benefit
setting
his
coarse
feeding
and
slovenly
habits
out
of
the
question
there
is
no
domestic
animal
so
profitable
or
so
useful
to
man
as
the
pig
or
any
that
yields
him
a
more
varied
or
more
luxurious
repast
the
prolific
powers
of
the
pig
are
extraordinary
even
under
the
restraint
of
domestication
but
when
left
to
run
wild
in
favourable
situations
as
in
the
islands
of
the
south
pacific
the
result
in
a
few
years
from
two
animals
put
on
shore
and
left
undisturbed
is
truly
surprising
for
they
breed
so
fast
and
have
such
numerous
litters
that
unless
killed
off
in
vast
numbers
both
for
the
use
of
the
inhabitants
and
as
fresh
provisions
for
ships
crews
they
would
degenerate
into
vermin
in
this
country
the
pig
has
usually
two
litters
or
farrows
in
a
year
the
breeding
seasons
being
april
and
october
and
the
period
the
female
goes
with
her
young
is
about
four
months
weeks
or
days
the
number
produced
at
each
litter
depends
upon
the
character
of
the
breed
being
the
average
number
in
the
small
variety
and
in
the
large
in
the
mixed
breeds
however
the
average
is
between
and
and
in
some
instances
has
reached
as
many
as
but
however
few
or
however
many
young
pigs
there
may
be
to
the
farrow
there
is
always
one
who
is
the
dwarf
of
the
family
circle
a
poor
little
shrivelled
anatomy
with
a
small
melancholy
voice
a
staggering
gait
a
countenance
and
a
thread
of
a
tail
whose
existence
the
complacent
mother
ignores
his
plethoric
brothers
and
sisters
repudiate
and
for
whose
emaciated
jaws
there
is
never
a
spare
or
supplemental
teat
till
one
of
the
favoured
gormandizers
overtaken
by
momentary
oblivion
drops
the
lacteal
fountain
and
gives
the
little
squeaking
straggler
the
chance
of
a
momentary
mouthful
this
miserable
little
object
which
may
be
seen
bringing
up
the
rear
of
every
litter
is
called
the
tony
pig
or
the
so
named
it
is
presumed
from
being
the
one
always
assigned
to
the
church
when
tithe
was
taken
in
kind
and
as
anthony
was
the
patron
of
husbandry
his
name
was
given
in
a
sort
of
bitter
derision
to
the
starveling
that
constituted
his
dues
for
whether
there
are
ten
or
fifteen
farrows
to
the
litter
the
anthony
is
always
the
last
of
the
family
to
come
into
the
world
from
the
grossness
of
his
feeding
the
large
amount
of
aliment
he
consumes
his
gluttonous
way
of
eating
it
from
his
slothful
habits
laziness
and
indulgence
in
sleep
the
pig
is
particularly
liable
to
disease
and
especially
indigestion
heartburn
and
affections
of
the
skin
to
counteract
the
consequence
of
a
violation
of
the
physical
laws
a
powerful
monitor
in
the
brain
of
the
pig
teaches
him
to
seek
for
relief
and
medicine
to
open
the
pores
of
his
skin
blocked
up
with
mud
and
excite
perspiration
he
resorts
to
a
tree
a
stump
or
his
trough
anything
rough
and
angular
and
using
it
as
a
to
his
body
obtains
the
luxury
of
a
scratch
and
the
benefit
of
cuticular
evaporation
he
next
proceeds
with
his
long
supple
snout
to
grub
up
antiscorbutic
roots
cooling
salads
of
mallow
and
dandelion
and
greatest
treat
of
all
he
stumbles
on
a
piece
of
chalk
or
a
mouthful
of
delicious
cinder
which
he
knows
by
instinct
is
the
most
sovereign
remedy
in
the
world
for
that
hot
unpleasant
sensation
he
has
had
all
the
morning
at
his
stomach
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
though
every
one
who
keeps
a
pig
knows
how
prone
he
is
to
disease
how
that
disease
injures
the
quality
of
the
meat
and
how
eagerly
he
pounces
on
a
bit
of
coal
or
cinder
or
any
coarse
dry
substance
that
will
adulterate
the
rich
food
on
which
he
lives
and
by
affording
soda
to
his
system
correct
the
vitiated
fluids
of
his
body
yet
very
few
have
the
judgment
to
act
on
what
they
see
and
by
supplying
the
pig
with
a
few
shovelfuls
of
cinders
in
his
sty
save
the
necessity
of
his
rooting
for
what
is
so
needful
to
his
health
instead
of
this
however
and
without
supplying
the
animal
with
what
its
instinct
craves
for
his
nostril
is
bored
with
a
iron
and
a
ring
clinched
in
his
nose
to
prevent
rooting
for
what
he
feels
to
be
absolutely
necessary
for
his
health
and
ignoring
the
fact
that
in
a
domestic
state
at
least
the
pig
lives
on
the
richest
of
all
food
scraps
of
cooked
animal
substances
boiled
vegetables
bread
and
other
items
given
in
that
concentrated
essence
of
aliment
for
a
quadruped
called
wash
and
that
he
eats
to
repletion
takes
no
exercise
and
finally
sleeps
all
the
hours
he
is
not
eating
and
then
when
the
animal
at
last
seeks
for
those
medicinal
aids
which
would
obviate
the
evil
of
such
a
forcing
diet
his
keeper
instead
of
meeting
his
animal
instinct
by
human
reason
and
giving
him
what
he
seeks
has
the
inhumanity
to
torture
him
by
a
ring
that
keeping
up
a
perpetual
raw
in
the
pig
snout
prevents
his
digging
for
those
corrective
drugs
which
would
remove
the
evils
of
his
artificial
existence
though
subject
to
so
many
diseases
no
domestic
animal
is
more
easily
kept
in
health
cleanliness
and
comfort
and
this
without
the
necessity
of
ringing
or
any
excessive
desire
of
the
hog
to
roam

through
his
sty

plough
up

may
be

the

fed

teaspoonful

always
be
given
in

heap

occasional
bits

the
consideration

orders
in

it
will
be
necessary
to
make
a
few
remarks
relative
to
the
pig
generally
in
the
first
place
the
is
regarded
by
breeders
as
the
best
and
most
eligible
animal
not
only
from
the
fineness
and
delicacy
of
the
skin
but
because
it
is
less
affected
by
the
heat
in
summer
and
far
less
subject
to
cuticular
disease
than
either
the
white
or
brindled
hog
but
more
particularly
from
its
kindlier
nature
and
greater
aptitude
to
fatten
the
great
quality
first
sought
for
in
a
hog
is
a
capacious
stomach
and
next
a
healthy
power
of
digestion
for
the
greater
the
quantity
he
can
eat
and
the
more
rapidly
he
can
digest
what
he
has
eaten
the
more
quickly
will
he
fatten
and
the
faster
he
can
be
made
to
increase
in
flesh
without
a
material
increase
of
bone
the
better
is
the
breed
considered
and
the
more
valuable
the
animal
in
the
usual
order
of
nature
the
development
of
flesh
and
enlargement
of
bone

together

the
object
is
to
outstrip
the
growth
of
the
bones
by
the
quicker

and
on
the
whole
a
hardy
profitable
animal
and
one
well
disposed
to
fatten
there
is
no
variety
of
this
useful
animal
that
presents
such
peculiar
features
as
the
species
known
to
us
as
the
chinese
pig
and
as
it
is
the
general
belief
that
to
this
animal
and
the
neapolitan
hog
we
are
indebted
for
that
remarkable
improvement
which
has
taken
place
in
the
breeds
of
the
english
pig
it
is
necessary
to
be
minute
in
the
description
of
this
in
all
respects
singular
animal
the
chinese
in
the
first
place
consists
of
many
varieties
and
presents
as
many
forms
of
body
as
differences
of
colour
the
best
kind
however
has
a
beautiful
white
skin
of
singular
thinness
and
delicacy
the
hair
too
is
perfectly
white
and
thinly
set
over
the
body
with
here
and
there
a
few
bristles
he
has
a
broad
snout
short
head
eyes
bright
and
fiery
very
small
fine
pink
ears
wide
cheeks
high
chine
with
a
neck
of
such
immense
thickness
that
when
the
animal
is
fat
it
looks
like
an
elongated
carcase
a
mass
of
fat
without
shape
or
form
like
a
feather
pillow
the
belly
is
dependent
and
almost
trailing
on
the
ground
the
legs
very
short
and
the
tail
so
small
as
to
be
little
more
than
a
rudiment
it
has
a
ravenous
appetite
and
will
eat
anything
that
the
wonderful
assimilating
powers
of
its
stomach
can
digest
and
to
that
capability
there
seems
no
limit
in
the
whole
range
of
animal
or
vegetable
nature
the
consequence
of
this
perfect
and
singularly
rapid
digestion
is
an
unprecedented
proneness
to
obesity
a
process
of
fattening
that
once
commenced
goes
on
with
such
rapid
development
that
in
a
short
time
it
loses
all
form
depositing
such
an
amount
of
fat
that
it
in
fact
ceases
to
have
any
refuse
part
or
offal
and
beyond
the
hair
on
its
back
and

callous
extremity
of
the

the
flesh
of

is
extremely
delicate
and
delicious
but
when
left
to

almost
exclusively
on
animal
food
it
becomes
oily
coarse
and
unpleasant
perhaps
there
is
no
other
instance
in
nature
where
the
effect
of
rapid
and
perfect
digestion
is
so
well
shown
as
in
this
animal
which
thrives
on
and
turns
to
the
benefit
of
its
physical
economy

the
most
and
of

most

the
thin
cuticle
that
is
one
of
its
characteristics
cracks
from
the
adipose
distension
beneath
exposing
the
fatty
mass
which
discharges
a
liquid
oil
from
the
adjacent
tissues
the
great
fault
in
this
breed
is
the
remarkably
small
quantity
of
lean
laid
down
to
the
immense
proportion
of
fat
some
idea
of
the
growth
of
this
species
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
of
their
attaining
to
stone
before
two
years
and
when
further
advanced
as
much
as
stone
in
its
pure
state
except
for
roasters
the
chinese
pig
is
too
disproportionate
for
the
english
market
but
when
crossed
with
some
of
our
lean
stock
the
breed
becomes
almost
invaluable

points

of

to
what
ultimate
use
is
the
flesh
to
be
put
for
if
meant
to
be
eaten

the
breed
of
pigs
is
host
suited
for
the
purpose
if
for
hams
or
bacon
the
large
variety
of
the
animal
is
necessary
pigs
are
usually
weaned
between
six
and
eight
weeks
after
birth
after
which
they
are
fed
on
soft
food
such
as
mashed
potatoes
in
skimmed
or
the
general
period
at
which
the
small
hogs
are
killed
for
the
market
is
from
to
weeks
from
to
mouths
they
are
called
store
pigs
and
are
turned
out
to
graze
till
the
animal
has
acquired
its
full
stature
as
soon
as
this
point
has
been
reached
the
pig
should
be
forced
to
maturity
as
quickly
as
possible
he
should
therefore
be
taken
from
the
fields
and
and
shut
up
on
boiled
potatoes
buttermilk
and
after
a
time
to
be
followed
by
grains
wash
barley
and
indian
meal
supplying
his
sty
at
the
same
time
with
plenty
of
water

and
a
quantity
of
salt
in
every
mess
of
food
presented
to
him
the
estimated
number
of
pigs
in
great
britain
is
supposed
to
exceed
millions
and
considering
the
third
of
the
number
as
worth
apiece
and
the
remaining
as
of
the
relative
value
of
each
would
give
a
marketable
estimate
of
over
for
this
animal
alone
the
best
and
most
humane
mode
of
killing
all
large
hogs
is
to
strike
them
down
like
a
bullock
with
the
pointed
end
of
a
poleaxe
on
the
forehead
which
has
the
effect
of
killing
the
animal
at
once
all
the
butcher
has
then
to
do
is
to
open
the
aorta
and
great
arteries
and
laying
the
animal
neck
over
a
trough
let
out
the
blood
as
quickly
as
possible
the
carcase
is
then
to
be
scalded
either
on
a
board
or
by
immersion
in
a
tub
of
very
hot
water
and
all
the
hair
and
dirt
rapidly
scraped
off
till
the
skin
is
made
perfectly
white
when
it
is
hung
up
opened
and
dressed
as
it
is
called
in
the
usual
way
it
is
then
allowed
to
cool
a
sheet
being
thrown
around
the
carcase
to
prevent
the
air
from
discolouring
the
skin
when
meant
for
bacon
the
hair
is
singed
instead
of
being
scalded
off
in
the
country
where
for
ordinary
consumption
the
pork
killed
for
sale
is
usually
both
larger
and
fatter
than
that
supplied
to
the
london
consumer
it
is
customary
to
remove
the
skin
and
fat
down
to
the
lean
and
salting
that
roast
what
remains
of
the
joint
pork
goes
further
and
is
consequently
a
more
economical
food
than
other
meats
simply
because
the
texture
is
closer
and
there
is
less
waste
in
the
cooking
either
in
roasting
or
boiling
in
fresh
pork
the
leg
is
the
most
economical
family
joint
and
the
loin
the
richest
comparatively
speaking
very
little
difference
exists
between
the
weight
of
the
live
and
dead
pig
and
this
simply
because
there
is
neither
the
head
nor
the
hide
to
be
removed
it
has
been
proved
that
pork
loses

the
hunting
of
the
wild
boar
has
been
in
all
times
and
in
all
countries
a
pastime
of
the
highest
interest
and
excitement
and
from
the
age
of
nimrod
has
only
been
considered

one
of
the
most
exciting
of
sports
but
it
was
only
in
this
country
that
the
sport
was
conducted
without
dogs
a
real
contest
of
man
and
beast
the
hunter
armed
only
with
a
a
weapon
about
four
feet
long
the
ash
staff
guarded
by
plates
of
steel
and
terminating
in
a
long
narrow
and
very
sharp
blade
this
with
a
or
hanger
completed
his
offensive
arms
thus
equipped
the
hunter
would
either
encounter
his
enemy
face
to
face
confront
his
desperate
charge
as
with
erect
tail
depressed
head
and
flaming
eyes
he
rushed
with
his
foamy
tusks
full
against
him
who
either
sought
to
pierce
his
vitals
through
his
counter
or
driving
his
spear
through
his
chine
transfix
his
heart
or
failing
those
more
difficult
aims
plunge
it
into
his
flank
and
without
withdrawing
the
weapon
strike
his
ready
hanger
into
his
throat
but
expert
as
the
hunter
might
be
it
was
not
often
the
formidable
brute
was
so
quickly
dispatched
for
he
would
sometimes
seize
the
spear
in
his
powerful
teeth
and
nip
it
off
like
a
reed
or
coming
full
tilt
on
his
enemy
by
his
momentum
and
weight
bear
him
to
the
earth
ripping
up
with
a
horrid
gash
his
leg
or
side
and
before
the
writhing
hunter
could
draw
his
knife
the
infuriated
beast
would
plunge
his
snout
in
the
wound
and
rip
with
savage
teeth
the
bowels
of
his
victim
at
other
times
he
would
suddenly
swerve
from
his
charge
and
doubling
on
his
opponent
attack

the
rear

his

weight

are

in

than
formerly
every
peasant
having
one
or
more
of
that
useful
animal
in
feudal
times
immense
droves
of
pigs
were
kept
by
the
franklings
and
barons
in
those
days
the
being
a
regular
part
of
the
domestic
service
of
every
feudal
household
their
duty
consisted
in
daily
driving
the
herd
of
swine
from
the
or
outlying
farm
to
the
nearest
woods
chase
or
forest
where
the
frankling
or
vavasour
had
either
by
right
or
grant
what
was
called
or
the
liberty
to
feed
his
hogs
off
the
acorns
beech
and
chestnuts
that
lay
in
such
abundance
on
the
earth
and
far
exceeded
the
power
of
the
royal
or
privileged
game
to
consume
indeed
it
was
the
license
granted
the
nobles
of
free
warren
especially
for
their
swine
that
kept
up
the
iniquitous
forest
laws
to
so
late
a
date
and
covered
so
large
a
portion
of
the
land
with
such
immense
tracts
of
wood
and
brake
to
the
injury
of
agriculture
and
the
misery
of
the
people
some
idea
of
the
extent
to
which
swine
were
grazed
in
the
feudal
times
may
be
formed
by
observing
the
number
of
pigs
still
fed
in
epping
forest
the
forest
of
dean
and
the
new
forest
in
hampshire
where
for
several
months
of
the
year
the
and
acorns
yield
them
so
plentiful
a
diet
in
germany
where
the
chestnut
is
so
largely
cultivated
the
amount
of
food
shed
every
autumn
is
enormous
and
consequently
the
pig
both
wild
and
domestic
has
for
a
considerable
portion
of
the
year
an
unfailing
supply
of
admirable
nourishment
impressed
with
the
value
of
this
fruit
for
the
food
of
pigs
the
prince
consort
has
with
great
judgment
of
late
encouraged
the
collection
of
chestnuts
in
windsor
park
and
by
giving
a
small
reward
to
old
people
and
children
for
every
bushel
collected
has
not
only
found
an
occupation
for
many
of
the
unemployed
poor
but
by
providing
a
gratuitous
food
for
their
pig
encouraged
a
feeling
of
providence
and
economy
for
curing
bacon
and
keeping
it
free
from
rust
cobbett
recipe
the
two
sides
that
remain
and
which
are
called
flitches
are
to
be
cured
for
bacon
they
are
first
rubbed
with
salt
on
their
insides
or
flesh
sides
then
placed
one
on
the
other
the
flesh
sides
uppermost
in
a
which
has
a
gutter
round
its
edges
to
drain
away
the
brine
for
to
have
sweet
and
fine
bacon
the
flitches
must
not
be
sopping
in
brine
which
gives
it
the
sort
of
vile
taste
that
barrel
and
sea
pork
have
every
one
knows
how
different
is
the
taste
of
fresh
dry
salt
from
that
of
salt
in
a
dissolved
state
therefore
change
the
salt
often
once
in
or
days
let
it
melt
and
sink
in
but
not
lie
too
long
twice
change
the
flitches
put
that
at
bottom
which
was
first
on
the
top
this
mode
will
cost
you
a
great
deal
more
in
salt
than
the
sopping
mode
but
without
it
your
bacon
will
not
be
so
sweet
and
fine
nor
keep
so
well
as
for
the
time
required
in
making
your
flitches
sufficiently
salt
it
depends
on
circumstances
it
takes
a
longer
time
for
a
thick
than
a
thin
flitch
and
longer
in
dry
than
in
damp
weather
or
in
a
dry
than
in
a
damp
place
but
for
the
flitches
of
a
hog
of
five
score
in
weather
not
very
dry
or
damp
about
weeks
may
do
and
as
yours
is
to
be
fat
which
receives
little
injury
from
give
time
enough
for
you
are
to
have
bacon
until
christmas
comes
again
the
place
for
salting
should
like
a
dairy
always
be
cool
but
well
ventilated
confined
air
though
cool
will
taint
meat
sooner
than
the
midday
day
sun
accompanied
by
a
breeze
with
regard
to
smoking
the
bacon
two
precautions
are
necessary
first
to
hang
the
flitches
where
no
rain
comes
down
upon
them
and
next
that
the
smoke
must
proceed
from
wood
not
peat
turf
or
coal
as
to
the
time
required
to
smoke
a
flitch
it
depends
a
good
deal
upon
whether
there
be
a
constant
fire
beneath
and
whether
the
fire
be
large
or
small
a
month
will
do
if
the
fire
be
pretty
constant
and
rich
as
a
farmhouse
fire
usually
is
but
or
rather
too
long
hanging
in
the
air
makes
the
bacon
rust
great
attention
should
therefore
be
paid
to
this
matter
the
flitch
ought
not
to
be
dried
up
to
the
hardness
of
a
board
and
yet
it
ought
to
be
perfectly
dry
before
you
hang
it
up
lay
it
on
the
floor
scatter
the
flesh
side
pretty
thickly
over
with
bran
or
with
some
fine
sawdust
not
of
deal
or
fir
rub
it
on
the
flesh
or
pat
it
well
down
upon
it
this
keeps
the
smoke
from
getting
into
the
little
openings
and
makes
a
sort
of
crust
to
be

flitch
and
then
put
in
more
ashes
then
another
flitch
and
cover
this
with
six
or
eight
inches
of
the
ashes
the
place
where
the

is
kept
ought
to
be
dry
and
should
the
ashes
become
damp
they
should
be
put
in
the
fireplace
to
dry
and
when
cold
put
back
again
with
these
precautions
the

bacon
on

man
of

had
just
been
tried
for

of
crime
the
prisoner
suddenly
claimed
to
be
heard
in

of
judgment
saying
with
an
expression
of
arch
confidence
as
he
addressed
the
bench
i
claim
indulgence
my
lord
on
the
plea
of
relationship
for
i
am
convinced
your
lordship
will
never
be
unnatural
enough
to
hang
one
of
your
own
family
indeed
replied
the
judge
with
some
amazement
i
was
not
aware
that
i
had
the
honour
of
your
alliance
perhaps
you
will
be
good
enough
to
name
the
degree
of
our
mutual
affinity
i
am
sorry
my
lord
returned
the
impudent
thief
i
can
not
trace
the
links
of
consanguinity
but
the
moral
evidence
is
sufficiently
pertinent
my
name
my
lord
is
hogg
your
lordship
is
bacon
and
all
the
world
will
allow
that
bacon
and
hog
are
very
closely
allied
i
am
sorry
replied
his
lordship
i
can
not
admit
the
truth
of
your
instance
hog
can
not
be
bacon
till
it
is
hanged
and
so
before
i
can
admit
your
plea
or

cloister

was
about

was
much
annoyed

noise

complaining

the
countryman
at

dangled
his

companion
by

soon
discovered

under
the

congestion
caused
by

had
indeed
become
silent

the
most
remarkable
connected
with
the
subject
in

were
two
events
that
occurred
in
scotland
about
the
and
centuries
a
border
family
having
been
dispossessed
of
their
castle
and
lands
by
a
more
powerful
chief
were
reduced
for
many
years
to
great
indigence
the
expelled
owner
only
living
in
the
hope
of
wreaking
a
terrible
vengeance
which
agreeably
to
the
motto
of
his
house
he
was
content
to
bide
his
time
for
the
usurper
having
invited
a
large
number
of
his
kindred
to
a
grand
hunt
in
his
new
domains
and
a
feast
after
in
the
great
hall
returned
from
the
chase
and
discovering
the
feast
not
spread
vented
his
wrath
in
no
measured
terms
on
the
heads
of
the
tardy
servitors

length

menial
approached
followed
by
a
line
of
servants
and
placing
the
boar
head
on
the
table
the
guests
rushed
forward
to
begin
the
meal
when
to
their
horror
they
discovered
not
a
boar
but
a
bull
head
a
sign
of
death
the
doors
were
immediately
closed
and
the
false
servants
who
were
the
adherents
of
the
dispossessed
chief
threw
off
their
disguise
and
falling
on
the
usurper

them

all
to

off

that
in
ireland
the
pig
is
in
every
respect
a
domesticated
animal
sharing
often
both
the
bed
and
board
of
the
family
and
making
an
outer
ring
to
the
domestic
circle
as
seated
round
the
pot
of
potatoes
they
partake
of
the
midday
meal
called
dinner
an
irishman
upon
one
occasion
having
lost
an
interesting
member
of
his
household
in
the
form
of
a
promising
young
porker
consulted
his
priest
on
the
occasion
and
having
hinted
at
the
person
he
suspected
of
purloining
the
illegant
slip
of
a
pig
he
was
advised
to
take
no
further
notice
of
the
matter
but
leave
the
issue
to
his
spiritual
adviser
next
sunday
his
reverence
after
mass
came
to
the
front
of
the
and
looking
very
hard
at
the
supposed
culprit
exclaimed
who
stole
pat
doolan
pig
to
this
inquiry
there
was
of
course
no
answer
the
priest
did
not
expect
there
would
be
any
the
following
sunday
the
same
query
was
propounded
a
little
stronger
who
of
you
was
it
i
say
who
stole
poor
pat
pig
it
now
became
evident
that
the
culprit
was
a
hardened
sinner
so
on
the
third
sunday
instead
of
repeating
the
unsatisfactory
inquiry
the
priest
after
as
usual
eyeing
the
obdurate
offender
said
in
a
tone
of
pious
sorrow

that
night
when
the

and
will
be
found
fully
worthy
of
the
high
character
of
that
publication
curing
of
hams
and
bacon
the
carcass
of
the
hog
after
hanging
to
cool
is
laid
on
a
strong
bench
or
stool
and
the
head
is
separated
from
the
body
at
the
neck
close
behind
the
ears
the
feet
and
also
the
internal
fat
are
removed
the
carcass
is
next
divided
into
two
sides
in
the
following
manner
the
ribs
are
divided
about
an
inch
from
the
spine
on
each
side
and
the
spine
with
the
ends
of
the
ribs
attached
together
with
the
internal
flesh
between
it
and
the
kidneys
and
also
the
flesh
above
it
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
sides
are
removed
the
portion
of
the
carcass
thus
cut
out
is
in
the
form
of
a
wedge
the
breadth
of
the
interior
consisting
of
the
breadth
of
the
spine
and
about
an
inch
of
the
ribs
on
each
side
being
diminished
to
about
half
an
inch
at
the
exterior
or
skin
along
the
back
the
and
also
the
first
anterior
rib
are
also
dissected
from
the
side
sometimes
the
whole
of
the
ribs
are
removed
but
this
for
reasons
afterwards
to
be
noticed
is
a
very
bad
practice
when
the
hams
are
cured
separately
from
the
sides
which
is
generally
the
case
they
are
cut
out
so
as
to
include
the
in
a
similar
manner
to
the
london
mode
of
cutting
a
haunch
of
mutton
the
carcass
of
the
hog
thus
cut
up
is
ready
for
being
salted
which
process
in
large
caring
establishments
is
generally
as
follows
the
skin
side
of
the
pork
is
rubbed
over
with
a
mixture
of
fifty
parts
by
weight
of
salt
and
one
part
of
saltpetre
in
powder
and
the
incised
parts
of
the
ham
or
flitch
and
the
inside
of
the
flitch
covered
with
the
same
the
salted
bacon
in
pairs
of
flitches
with
the
insides
to
each
other
is
piled
one
pair
of
flitches
above
another
on
benches
slightly
inclined
and
furnished
with
spouts
or
troughs
to
convey
the
brine
to
receivers
in
the
floor
of
the
to
be
afterwards
used
for
pickling
pork
for
navy
purposes
in
this
state
the
bacon
remains
a
fortnight
which
is
sufficient
for
flitches
cut
from
nogs
of
a
carcass
weight
less
than
stone
lbs
to
the
stone
flitches
of
a
larger
size
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
are
wiped
dry
and
reversed
in
their
place
in
the
pile
having
at
the
same
time
about
half
the
first
quantity
of
fresh
dry
common
salt
sprinkled
over
the
inside
and
incised
parts
after
which
they
remain
on
the
benches
for
another
week
hams
being
thicker
than
flitches
will
require
when
less
than
lbs
weight
weeks
and
when
above
that
weight
weeks
to
remain
under
the
process
the
next
and
last
process
in
the
preparation
of
bacon
and
hams
previous
to
being
sent
to
market
is
drying
this
is
effected
by
hanging
the
flitches
and
hams
for
or
weeks
in
a
room
heated
by
stoves
or
in
a
in
which
they
are
exposed
for
the
same
length
of
time
to
the
smoke
arising
from
the
slow
combustion
of
the
sawdust
of
oak
or
other
hard
wood
the
latter
mode
of
completing
the
curing
process
has
some
advantages
over
the
other
as
by
it
the
meat
is
subject
to
the
action
of
a
volatile
oil
produced
by
the
combustion
of
the
sawdust
which
is
powerfully
antiseptic
the
process
also
furnishing
a
thin
covering
of
a
resinous
varnish
excludes
the
air
not
only
from
the
muscle
but
also
from
the
fat
thus
effectually
preventing
the
meat
from
becoming
rusted
and
the
principal
reasons
for
condemning
the
practice
of
removing
the
ribs
from
the
flitches
of
pork
are
that
by
so
doing
the
meat
becomes
unpleasantly
hard
and
pungent
in
the
process
of
salting
and
by
being
more
opposed
to
the
action
of
the
air
becomes
sooner
and
more
extensively
rusted
notwithstanding
its
superior
efficacy
in
completing
the
process
of
curing
the
flavour
which
imparts
to
meat
is
disliked
by
many
persons
and
it
is
therefore
by
no
means
the
most
general
mode
of
drying
adopted
by
mercantile
curers
a
very
impure
variety
of
acid
or
vinegar
made
from
the
destructive
distillation
of
wood
is
sometimes
used
on
account
of
the
highly
preservative
power
of
the
creosote
which
it
contains
and
also
to
impart
the
in
which
latter
object
however
the
coarse
flavour
of
tar
is
given
rather
than
that
derived
from
the
smoke
from
combustion
of
wood
a
considerable
portion
of
the
bacon
and
hams
salted
in
ireland
is
exported
from
that
country
packed
amongst
salt
in
bales
immediately
from
the
salting
process
without
having
been
in
any
degree
dried
in
the
process
of
salting
above
described

loses
from
eight
to
ten
per

of
its
weight

to
the
size
and
quality
of
the

further
diminution

the

were
from

in

miocene
of

near

suffolk
they
were
associated
with
teeth
of
an
extinct
about
the
size
of
a
leopard
with
those
of
a
bear
and
with
remains
of
a
large
cervus
these
mammalian
remains
were
found
with
the
ordinary
fossils
of
the
red
crag
they
had
undergone
the
same
process
of
trituration
and
were
impregnated
with
the

colouring
matter
as
the
associated
bones
and
teeth
of
fishes
acknowledged
to
be
derived
from
the
regular
strata
of
the
red

these
mammaliferous
beds
have
been
proved
by
lyell
to
be
older

the
universality
of
the
a
singular
circumstance
in
the
domestic
history
of
the
hog
is
the
extent
of
its
distribution
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
being
found
even
in
insulated
places
where
the
inhabitants
are
and
where
the
wild
species
is
entirely
unknown
the
islands
for
example
were
found
on
their
discovery
to
be
well
stocked
with
a
small
black
hog
and
the
traditionary
belief
of
the
people
was
that
these
animals
were
coeval
with
the
origin
of
themselves
yet
they
possessed
no
knowledge
of
the
wild
boar
or
any
other
animal
of
the
hog
kind
from
which
the
domestic
breed
might
be
supposed
to
be
derived
in
these
islands
the
hog
is
the
principal
quadruped
and
the
fruit
of
the
is
its
principal
food
although
it
is
also
fed
with
yams
eddoes
and
other
vegetables
this
nutritious
diet
which
it
has
in
great
abundance
is
according
to
foster
the
reason
of
its
flesh
being
so
delicious
so
full
of
juice
and
so
rich
in
fat
which
is
not

the
antiquity
of
the
by
what
nation
and
in
what
period
the

was
reclaimed
is
involved
in
the
deepest
obscurity
so
far
back
as
we
have
any
records
of
history
we
find
notices
of
this
animal
and
of
its
flesh
being
used
as
the
food
of
man
by
some
nations
however
its
flesh
was
denounced
as
unclean
and
therefore
prohibited
to
be
used
whilst
by
others
it
was
esteemed
as
a
great
delicacy
by
the
mosaic
law
it
was
forbidden
to
be
eaten
by
the
jews
and
the
mahometans
hold
it
in
utter
abhorrence
kitto
however
says
that
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
reason
in
the
law
of
moses
why
the
hog
should
be
held
in
such
peculiar
abomination
there
seems
nothing
to
have
prevented
the
jews
if
they
had
been
so
inclined
to
rear
pigs
for
sale
or
for
the
use
of
the
land
in
the
talmud
there
are
some
indications
that
this
was
actually
done
and
it
was
probably
for
such
purposes
that
the
herds
of
swine
mentioned
in
the
new
testament
were
kept
although
it
is
usual
to
consider
that
they
were
kept
by
the
foreign
settlers
in
the
land
indeed
the
story
which
accounts
for
the
peculiar
aversion
of
the
hebrews
to
the
hog
assumes
that
it
did
not
originate
until
about
years
before
christ
and
that
previously
some
jews
were
in
the
habit
of
rearing
hogs

those
who

however
much
the

of
the

was
esteemed
by
the
greeks
and

yet
the

is
not

who
in

greece
and

painted

life
we
have
no
descriptions
of

descending
to
the

of

the

is
never

be
accounted
for

the
supposition
that
the

the
hog
in
from
time
immemorial
in
england
this
animal
has
been
esteemed
as
of
the
highest
importance
in
the
period
vast
herds
of
swine
were
tended
by
men
who
watched
over
their
safety
and
who
collected
them
under
shelter
at
night
at
that
time
the
flesh
of
the
animal
was
the
staple
article
of
consumption
in
every
family
and
a
large
portion
of
the
wealth
of
the
rich
freemen
of
the
country
consisted
of
these
animals
hence
it
was
common
to
make
bequests
of
swine
with
lands
for
their
support
and
to
these
were
attached
rights
and
privileges
in
connection
with
their
feeding
and
the
extent
of
woodland
to
be
occupied
by
a
given
number
was
granted
in
accordance
with
established
rules
this
is
proved
by
an
ancient
saxon
grant
quoted
by
sharon
turner
in
his
history
of
the
where
the
right
of
pasturage
is
conveyed
in

the

words

have
of

the
learned
that
the
pig
is
capable
of
education
is
a
fact
long
known
to
the
world
and
though
like
the
ass
naturally
stubborn
and
obstinate
that
he
is
equally
amenable
with
other
animals
to
caresses
and
kindness
has
been
shown
from
very
remote
time
the
best
modern
evidence
of
his
docility
however
is
the
instance
of
the
learned
pig
first
exhibited
about
a
century
since
but
which
has
been
continued
down
to
our
own
time
by
repeated
instances
of
an
animal
who
will
put
together
all
the
letters

that
compose

how

was
charles
lamb
who
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
delighted
the
reading
public
by
his
quaint
prose
sketches
written
under
the
title
of
essays
of
elia
has
in
his
own
quiet
humorous
way
devoted
one
paper
to
the
subject
of
and
more
especially
to
that
luxurious
and
toothsome
dainty
known
as
crackling
and
shows
in
a
manner
peculiarly
his
own

to
this
erudite
authority
man

the
golden
age
or
at
all
events
the
primitive
age
eat
his
pork
and
bacon
raw
as
indeed
he
did
his
beef
and
mutton
unless
as
hudibras
tells
us
he
was
an
epicure
when
he
used
to
make
a
saddle
of
his
saddle
of
mutton
and
after
spreading
it
on
his
horse
back
and
riding
on
it
for
a
few
hours
till
thoroughly
warmed
he
sat
down
to
the
luxury
of
a
dish
cooked
to
a
turn
at
the
epoch
of
the
story
however
a
citizen
of
some
scythian
community
had
the
misfortune
to
have
his
hut
or
that
portion
of
it
containing
his
live
stock
of
pigs
burnt
down
in
going
over
the
on
the
following
day
and
picking
out
all
the
available
salvage
the
proprietor
touched
something
unusually
or
unexpectedly
hot
which
caused
him
to
shake
his
hand
with
great
energy
and
clap
the
tips
of
his
suffering
fingers
to
his
mouth
the
act
was
simple
and
natural
but
the
result
was
wonderful
he
rolled
his
eyes
in
ecstatic
pleasure
his
frame
distended
and
conscious
of
a
celestial
odour
his
nostrils
widened
and
while
drawing
in
deep
inspirations
of
the
ravishing
perfume
he
sucked
his
fingers
with
a
gusto
he
had
never
in
his
most
hungry
moments
conceived
clearing
away
the
rubbish
from
beneath
him
he
at
last
brought
to
view
the
carcase
of
one
of
his
pigs
to
stooping
down
to
examine
this
curious
object
and
touching
its
body
a
fragment
of
the
burnt
skin
was
detached
which
with
a
sort
of
superstitious
dread
he
at
length
and
in
a
spirit
of
philosophical
inquiry
put
into
his
mouth
ye
gods
the
felicity
he
then
enjoyed
no
pen
can
chronicle
then
it
was
that
he
the
world
first
tasted
like
a
miser
with
his
gold
the
scythian
hid
his
treasure
from
the
prying
eyes
of
the
world
and
feasted
in
secret
more
sumptuously
than
the
gods
when
he
had
eaten
up
all
his
pig
the
poor
man
fell
into
a
melancholy
he
refused
the
most
tempting
steak
though
cooked
on
the
horse
back
and
turned
every
after
his
own
favourite
recipe
he
fell
in
fact
from
his
appetite
and
was
reduced
to
a
shadow
till
unable
longer
to
endure
the
torments
of
memory
he
hourly
suffered
he
rose
one
night
and
secretly
set
fire
to
his
hut
and
once
more
was
restored
to
flesh
and
manhood
finding
it
impossible
to
live
in
future
without
he
set
fire
to
his
house
every
time
his
larder
became
empty
till
at
last
his
neighbours
scandalized
by
the
frequency
of
these
incendiary
acts
brought
his
conduct
before
the
supreme
council
of
the
nation
to
avert
the
penalty
that
awaited
him
he
brought
his
judges
to
the
smouldering
ruins
and
discovering
the
secret
invited
them
to
eat
which
having
done
with
tears
of
gratitude
the
august
synod
embraced
him
and
with
an
overflowing
feeling
of
ecstasy
dedicated
a
statue
to
the
memory

a
seems
at
first
sight
rather
an
elaborate
dish

rather
animal
to
carve
but
by
carefully
mastering
the
details
of
the
business
every
difficulty
will
vanish

in
the
manner
shown
in

also
in

and
the
first
point
to
be
attended
to
is
to
separate
the
shoulder
from
the
carcase
by
carrying
the
knife
quickly
and
neatly
round
the
circular
line
as
shown
by
the
figures

shoulder
will
then
easily
come
away
the
next
step
is
to
take
off
the
leg

this
is
done
in
the
same
way
by
cutting
round
this
joint

the
direction
shown
by
the
figures
in
the
same
way
as

ribs

stand
fairly
open
to
the
knife

should
be
carried
down
in
the
direction
of

two
or
three
helpings
will
dispose
of
these

other
half

served

parts
of
the

variously
esteemed

preferring
the
flesh
of
the

others

others
again
the
shoulders
the
truth
is
the
whole
of
a
is
delicious

in
carving
it
the
host
should
consult
the
various
tastes

general
observations
on

calf
any
remarks
made
on
the
calf
or
the
lamb
must
naturally
be
in
a
measure
supplementary
to
the
more
copious
observations
made
on
the
parent
stock
of
either
as
the
calf
at
least
as
far
as
it
is
identified
with
veal
is
destined
to
die
young
to
be
indeed
cut
off
in
its
comparative
infancy
it
may
at
first
sight
appear
of
little
or
no
consequence
to
inquire
to
what
particular
variety
or
breed
of
the
general
stock
his
sire
or
dam
may
belong
the
great
art
however
in
the
modern
science
of
husbandry
has
been
to
obtain
an
animal
that
shall
not
only
have
the
utmost
beauty
of
form
of
which
the
species
is
capable
but
at
the
same
time
a
constitution
free
from
all
taint
a
frame
that
shall
rapidly
attain
bulk
and
stature
and
a
disposition
so
kindly
that
every
of
food
it
takes
shall
without
drawback
or
procrastination
be
eliminated
into
fat
and
muscle
the
breed
then
is
of
very
considerable
consequence
in
determining
not
only
the
quality
of
the
meat
to
the
consumer
but
its
commercial
value
to
the
breeder
and
butcher
under
the
artificial
system
adopted
in
the
rearing
of
domestic
cattle
and
stock
in
general
to
gratify
the
arbitrary
mandates
of
luxury
and
fashion
we
can
have
veal
like
lamb
at
all
seasons
in
the
market
though
the
usual
time
in
the
metropolis
for
veal
to
make
its
appearance
is
about
the
beginning
of
february
the
cow
goes
with
young
for
nine
months
and
the
affection
and
solicitude
she
evinces
for
her
offspring
is
more
human
in
its
tenderness
mid
intensity
than
is
displayed
by
any
other
animal
and
her
distress
when
she
hears
its
bleating
and
is
not
allowed
to
reach
it
with
her
distended
udders
is
often
painful
to
witness
and
when
the
calf
has
died
or
been
accidentally
killed
her
grief
frequently
makes
her
refuse
to
give
down
her
milk
at
such
times
the
breeder
has
adopted
the
expedient
of
flaying
the
dead
carcase
and
distending
the
skin
with
hay
lays
the
effigy
before
her
and
then
taking
advantage
of
her
solicitude
milks
her
while
she
is
caressing
the
skin
with
her
tongue
in
a
state
of
nature
the
cow
like
the
deer
hides
her
young
in
the
tall
ferns
and
brakes
and
the
most
secret
places
and
only
at
stated
times
twice
or
thrice
a
day
quits
the
herd
and
hastening
to
the
secret
cover
gives
suck
to
her
calf
and
with
the
same
circumspection
returns
to
the
community
in
some
countries
to
please
the
epicurean
taste
of
vitiated
appetites
it
is
the
custom
to
kill
the
calf
for
food
almost
immediately
after
birth
and
any
accident
that
forestalls
that
event
is
considered
to
enhance
its
value
we
are
happy
to
say
however
that
in
this
country
as
far
as
england
and
scotland
are
concerned
the
taste
for
very
young
veal
has
entirely
gone
out
and
staggering
bob
as
the
poor
little
animal
was
called
in
the
language
of
the
shambles
is
no
longer
to
be
met
with
in
such
a
place
the
weaning
of
calves
is
a
process
that
requires
a
great
amount
of
care
and
judgment
for
though
they
are
in
reality
not
weaned
till
between
the
eighth
and
the
twelfth
week
the
process
of
rearing
them
by
hand
commences
in
fact
from
the
birth
the
calf
never
being
allowed
to
suck
its
dam
as
the
rearing
of
calves
for
the
market
is
a
very
important
and
lucrative
business
the
breeder
generally
arranges
his
stock
so
that
ten
or
a
dozen
of
his
cows
shall
calve
about
the
same
time
and
then
by
setting
aside
one
or
two
to
find
food
for
the
entire
family
gets
the
remaining
eight
or
ten
with
their
full
fountains
of
milk
to
carry
on
the
operations
of
his
dairy
some
people
have
an
idea
that
skimmed
milk
if
given
in
sufficient
quantity
is
good
enough
for
the
weaning
period
of
but
this
is
a
very
serious
mistake
for
the
cream
of
which
it
has
been
deprived
contained
nearly
all
the
oleaginous
principles
and
the
azote
or
nitrogen
on
which
the
vivifying
properties
of
that
fluid
depends
indeed
so
remarkably
correct
has
this
fact
proved
to
be
that
a
calf
reared
on
one
part
of
new
milk
mixed
with
five
of
water
will
thrive
and
look
well
while
another
treated
with
unlimited
skimmed
milk
will
be
poor
thin
and
miserable
it
is
sometimes
a
matter
of
considerable
trouble
to
induce
the
blundering
calf
whose
instinct
only
teaches
him
to
suck
and
that
he
will
do
at
anything
and
with
anything
acquire
the
knowledge
of
imbibition
that
for
the
first
few
days
it
is
often
necessary
to
fill
a
bottle
with
milk
and
opening
his
mouth
pour
the
contents
down
his
throat
the
manner
however
by
which
he
is
finally
educated
into
the
mystery
of
suction
is
by
putting
his
allowance
of
milk
into
a
large
wooden
bowl
the
nurse
then
puts
her
hand
into
the
milk
and
by
bending
her
fingers
upwards
makes
a
rude
teat
for
the
calf
to
grasp
in
his
lips
when
the
vacuum
caused
by
his
suction
of
the
fingers
causes
the
milk
to
rise
along
them
into
his
mouth
in
this
manner
one
by
one
the
whole
family
are
to
be
fed
three
times
a
day
care
being
taken
that
calves
are
not
at
first
fed
on
milk
from
a
cow
who
has
some
days
calved
as
the
calf
progresses
towards
his
tenth
week
his
diet
requires
to
be
increased
in
quantity
and
quality
for
these
objects
his
milk
can
be
thickened
with
flour
or
meal
and
small
pieces
of
softened
are
to
be
slipped
into
his
mouth
after
sucking
that
they
may
dissolve
there
till
he
grows
familiar
with
and
to
like
the
taste
when
it
may
be
softened
and
scraped
down
into
his
after
a
time
sliced
turnips
softened
by
steam
are
to
be
given
to
him
in
tolerable
quantities
then
succulent
grasses
and
finally
hay
may
be
added
to
the
others
some
farmers
desirous
of
rendering
their
calves
fat
for
the
butcher
in
as
short
a
time
as
possible
forget
both
the
natural
weakness
of
the
digestive
powers
and
the
contracted
volume
of
the
stomach
and
allow
the
animals
either
to
suck
or
give
them
if
brought
up
at
the
pail
or
by
hand
a
larger
quantity
of
milk
than
they
can
digest
the
idea
of
overloading
the
stomach
never
suggests
itself
to
their
minds
they
suppose
that
the
more
food
the
young
creature
consumes
the
sooner
it
will
be
fat
and
they
allow
it
no
exercise
whatever
for
fear
it
should
denude
its
very
bones
of
their
flesh
under
such
circumstances
the
stomach
soon
becomes
deranged
its
functions
are
no
longer
capable
of
acting
the
milk
subjected
to
the
acid
of
the
stomach
coagulates
and
forms
a
hardened
mass
of
curd
when
the
muscles
become
affected
with
spasms
and
death
frequently
ensues
there
was
no
species
of
slaughtering
practised
in
this
country
so
inhuman
and
disgraceful
as
that
till
very
lately
employed
in
killing
this
poor
animal
when
under
the
plea
of
making
the
flesh
the
calf
was
bled
day
by
day
till
when
the
final
hour
came
the
animal
was
unable
to
stand
this
inhumanity
is
we
believe
now
everywhere
abolished
and
the
calf
is
at
once
killed
and
with
the
least
amount
of
pain
a
knife
is
run
through
the
neck
severing
all
the
large
veins
and
arteries
up
to
the
vertebrae
the
skin
is
then
taken
off
to
the
knee
which
is
disjointed
and
to
the
head
which
is
removed
it
is
then
reflected
backwards
and
the
carcase
having
been
opened
and
dressed
is
kept
apart
by
stretchers
and
the
thin
membrane
the
caul
extended
over
the
organs
left
in
the
carcase
as
the
kidneys
and
some
melted
fat
is
then
scattered
suddenly
over
the
whole
interior
giving
that
white
and
frosted
appearance
to
the
meat
that
is
thought
to
add
to
its
beauty
the
whole
is
then
hung
up
to
cool
and
harden
the
manner
of
cutting
up
veal
for
the
english
market
is
to
divide
the
carcase
into
four
quarters
with
eleven
ribs
to
each
fore
quarter
which
are
again
subdivided
into
joints
as
exemplified
on
the
cut
illustration
side
of
a
calf
showing
the
several
joints
the
loin
the
chump
consisting
of
the
rump
and
the
fillet
the
hock
or
hind
knuckle
the
shoulder
the
neck
the
breast
the
fore
knuckle
the
several
parts
of
a
calf
about
eight
weeks
old
are
nearly
of
the
following
weights
loin
and
chump
fillet
hind
knuckle
shoulder
lbs
neck
breast
and
fore
knuckle
lbs
making
a
total

the
london
mode
of
cutting
the
carcase
is
considered
better
than
that
pursued
in
edinburgh
as
giving
three
roasting
joints
and
one
boiling
in
each
quarter
besides
the
pieces
being
more
equally
divided
as
regards
flesh
and

we

aaron
in

lengthened
absence

was
constrained
by
the
impatient
people
to
make
them
an
image
to
worship
and
that
aaron
instead
of
using
his
delegated
power
to
curb
this
sinful
expression
of
the
tribes
and
appease
the
discontented
jews
at
once
complied
with
their
demand
and
telling
them
to
bring
to
him
their
rings
and
trinkets
fashioned
out
of
their
willing
contributions
a
calf
of
gold
before
which
the
multitude
fell
down
and
worshipped
whether
this
image
was
a
solid
figure
of
gold
or
a
wooden
effigy
merely
coated
with
metal
is
uncertain
to
suppose
the
former
knowing
the
size
of
the
image
made
from
such
trifling
articles
as
rings
we
must
presuppose
the
israelites
to
have
spoiled
the
egyptians
most
unmercifully
the
figure
however
is
of
more
consequence
than
the
weight
or
size
of
the
idol
that
the
israelite
brought
away
more
from
goshen
than
the
plunder
of
the
egyptians
and
that
they
were
deeply
imbued
with
egyptian
superstition
the
golden
calf
is
only
one
out
of
many
instances
of
proof
for
a
gilded
ox
covered
with
a
pall
was
in
that
country
an
emblem
of
osiris
one
of
the
gods
of
the
egyptian
trinity
besides
having
a
sacred
cow
and
many
varieties
of
the
holy
bull
this
people
worshipped
the
ox
as
a
symbol
of
the
sun
and
offered
to
it
divine
honours
as
the
emblem
of
frugality
industry
and
husbandry
it
is
therefore
probable
that
in
borrowing
so
familiar
a
type
the
israelites
in
their
meant
under
a
cherubic
symbol
to
acknowledge
the
full
force
of
those
virtues

the
calf
a
symbol
of
divine
a
singular
symbolical
ceremony
existed
among
the
hebrews
in
which
the
calf
performed
a
most
important
part
the
calf
being
a
type
or
symbol
of
divine
power
or
what
was
called
the
the
almighty
intelligence
that
brought
them
out
of
egypt
was
looked
upon
much
in
the
same
light
by
the
jews
as
the
cross
subsequently
was
by
the
christians
a
mystical
emblem
of
the
divine
passion
and
goodness
consequently
an
oath
taken
on
either
the
calf
or
the
cross
was
considered
equally
solemn
and
sacred
by
jew
or
nazarene
and
the
breaking
of
it
a
perjury
on
themselves
and
an
insult
and
profanation
directly
offered
to
the
almighty
to
render
the
oath
more
impressive
and
solemn
it
was
customary
to
slaughter
a
dedicated
calf
in
the
temple
when
the
priests
having
divided
the
carcase
into
a
certain
number
of
parts
and
with
intervening
spaces
arranged
the
severed
limbs
on
the
marble
pavement
the
one
or
all
the
party
if
there
were
many
individuals
to
be
bound
by
the
oath
repeating
the
words
of
the
compact
threaded
their
way
in
and
out
through
the
different
spaces
till
they
had
taken
the
circuit
of
each
portion
of
the
divided
calf
when
the
ceremony
was
concluded
to
avert
the
anger
of
the
lord
when
jerusalem
was
threatened
by
nebuchadnezzar
and
his
babylonian
host
the
jews
had
made
a
solemn
to
god
ratified
by
the
ceremony
of
the
calf
if
he
released
them
from
their
dreaded
foe
to
cancel
the
servitude
of
their
hebrew
brethren
after
investing
the
city
for
some
time
and
reducing
the
inhabitants
to
dreadful
suffering
and
privation
the
babylonians
hearing
that
pharaoh
whom
the
jews
had
solicited
for
aid
was
rapidly
approaching
with
a
powerful
army
hastily
raised
the
siege
and
removing
to
a
distance
took
up
a
position
where
they
could
intercept
the
egyptians
and
still
cover
the
city
no
sooner
did
the
jews
behold
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
than
they
believed
all
danger
was
past
and
with
their
usual
turpitude
they
repudiated
their
oath
and
refused
to
liberate
their
oppressed
countrymen
for
this
violation
of
their
covenant
with
the
lord
they
were
given
over
to
all
the
horrors

the
fattening
of
the
fattening
of
calves
for
the
market
is
an
important
business
in
lanarkshire
or
clydesdale
and
numbers
of
calves
are
regularly
carried
there
from
the
farmers
of
the
adjacent
districts
in
order
to
be
prepared
for
the
butcher
the
mode
of
feeding
them
is
very
simple
milk
is
the
chief
article
of
their
diet
and
of
this
the
calves
require
a
sufficient
supply
from
first
to
last
added
to
this
they
must
be
kept
in
a
place
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
and
freely
supplied
with
dry
litter
it
is
usual
to
exclude
the
light
at
all
events
to
a
great
degree
and
to
put
within
their
reach
a
lump
of
chalk
which
they
are
very
fond
of
licking
thus
fed
calves
at
the
end
of
or
weeks
often
attain
a
very
large
size
to
stone
exclusive
of
the
offal
far
heavier
weights
have
occurred
and
without
any
deterioration
in
the
delicacy
and
richness
of
the
flesh
this
mode
of
feeding
upon
milk
alone
at
first
appears
to
be
very
expensive
but
it
is
not
so
when
all
things
are
taken
into
consideration
for
at
the
age
of
or
weeks
a
calf
originally
purchased
for
shillings
will
realize
nearly
the
same
number
of
pounds
for
or
even
weeks
the
milk
of
one
cow
is
sufficient
indeed
half
that
quantity
is
enough
for
the
first
fortnight
but
after
the
or
week
it
will
consume
the
greater
portion
of
the
milk
of
two
moderate
cows
but
then
it
requires
neither
nor
linseed
nor
any
other
food
usually
however
the
calves
are
not
kept
beyond
the
age
of
weeks
and
will
then
sell
for
or
pounds
each
the
milk
of
the
cow
is
then
ready
for
a
successor

this
manner

of

general
observations
on
birds
birds
the
free
tenants
of
land
air
and
ocean
their
forms
all
symmetry
their
motions
grace
in
plumage
delicate
and
beautiful
thick
without
burthen
close
as
fishes
scales
or
loose
as
poppies
to
the
breeze
pelican
the
divisions
of
birds
are
founded
principally
on
their
habits
of
life
and
the
natural
resemblance
which
their
external
parts
especially
their
bills
bear
to
each
other
according
to
vigors
there
are
five
orders
each
of
which
occupies
its
peculiar
place
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
so
that
the
air
the
forest
the
land
the
marsh
and
the
water
has
each
its
appropriate
kind
of
inhabitants
these
are
respectively
designated
as
birds
of
prey
perchers
walkers
waders
and
swimmers
and
in
contemplating
their
variety
lightness
beauty
and
wonderful
adaptation
to
the
regions
they
severally
inhabit
and
the
functions
they
are
destined
to
perform
in
the
grand
scheme
of
creation
our
hearts
are
lifted
with
admiration
at
the
exhaustless
ingenuity
power
and
wisdom
of
him
who
has
in
producing
them
so
strikingly
manifested
his
handiwork
not
only
these
however
but
all
classes
of
animals
have
their
peculiar
ends
to
fulfil
and
in
order
that
this
may
be
effectually
performed
they
are
constructed
in
such
a
manner
as
will
enable
them
to
carry
out
their
conditions
thus
the
quadrupeds
that
are
formed
to
tread
the
earth
in
common
with
man
are
muscular
and
vigorous
and
whether
they
have
passed
into
the
servitude
of
man
or
are
permitted
to
range
the
forest
or
the
field
they
still
retain
in
a
high
degree
the
energies
with
which
they
were
originally
endowed
birds
on
the
contrary
are
generally
feeble
and
therefore
timid
accordingly
wings
have
been
given
them
to
enable
them
to
fly
through
the
air
and
thus
elude
the
force
which
by
nature
they
are
unable
to
resist
notwithstanding
the
natural
tendency
of
all
bodies
towards
the
centre
of
the
earth
birds
when
raised
in
the
atmosphere
glide
through
it
with
the
greatest
ease
rapidity
and
vigour
there
they
are
in
their
natural
element
and
can
vary
their
course
with
the
greatest
promptitude
can
mount
or
descend
with
the
utmost
facility
and
can
light
on
any
spot
with
the
most
perfect
exactness
and
without
the
slightest
injury
to
themselves
the
mechanism
which
enables
birds
to
wing
their
course
through
the
air
is
both
singular
and
instructive
their
bodies
are
covered
with
feathers
which
are
much
lighter
than
coverings
of
hair
with
which
quadrupeds
are
usually
clothed
the
feathers
are
so
placed
as
to
overlap
each
other
like
the
slates
or
the
tiles
on
the
roof
of
a
house
they
are
also
arranged
from
the
backwards
by
which
the
animals
are
enabled
the
more
conveniently
to
cut
their
way
through
the
air
their
bones
are
tubular
or
hollow
and
extremely
light
compared
with
those
of
terrestrial
animals
this
greatly
facilitates
their
rising
from
the
earth
whilst
their
heads
being
comparatively
small
their
bills
shaped
like
a
wedge
their
bodies
slender
sharp
below
and
round
above
all
these
present
a
union
of
conditions
favourable
in
the
last
degree
to
cutting
their
way
through
the
aërial
element
to
which
they
are
considered
as
more
peculiarly
to
belong
with
all
these
conditions
however
birds
could
not
fly
without
wings
these
therefore
are
the
instruments
by
which
they
have
the
power
of
rapid
locomotion
and
are
constructed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
capable
of
great
expansion
when
struck
in
a
downward
direction
if
we
except
in
this
action
the
slight
hollow
which
takes
place
on
the
they
become
almost
two
planes
in
order
that
the
downward
action
may
be
accomplished
to
the
necessary
extent
the
muscles
which
move
the
wings
have
been
made
exceedingly
large
so
large
indeed
that
in
some
instances
they
have
been
estimated
at
not
less
than
a
sixth
of
the
weight
of
the
whole
body
therefore
when
a
bird
is
on
the
ground
and
intends
to
fly
it
takes
a
leap
and
immediately
stretching
its
wings
strikes
them
out
with
great
force
by
this
act
these
are
brought
into
an
oblique
direction
being
turned
partly
upwards
and
partly
horizontally
forwards
that
part
of
the
force
which
has
the
upward
tendency
is
neutralized
by
the
weight
of
the
bird
whilst
the
horizontal
force
serves
to
carry
it
forward
the
stroke
being
completed
it
moves
upon
its
wings
which
being
contracted
and
having
their
edges
turned
upwards
obviate
in
a
great
measure
the
resistance
of
the
air
when
it
is
sufficiently
elevated
it
makes
a
second
stroke
downwards
and
the
impulse
of
the
air
again
moves
it
forward
these
successive
strokes
may
be
regarded
as
so
many
leaps
taken
in
the
air
when
the
bird
desires
to
direct
its
course
to
the
right
or
the
left
it
strikes
strongly
with
the
opposite
wing
which
impels
it
to
the
proper
side
in
the
motions
of
the
animal
too
the
tail
takes
a
prominent
part
and
acts
like
the
rudder
of
a
ship
except
that
instead
of
sideways
it
moves
upwards
and
downwards
if
the
bird
wishes
to
rise
it
raises
its
tail
and
if
to
fall
it
depresses
it
and
whilst
in
a
horizontal
position
it
keeps
it
steady
there
are
few
who
have
not
observed
a
pigeon
or
a
crow
preserve
for
some
time
a
horizontal
flight
without
any
apparent
motion
of
the
wings
this
is
accomplished
by
the
bird
having
already
acquired
sufficient
velocity
and
its
wings
being
parallel
to
the
horizon
meeting
with
but
small
resistance
from
the
atmosphere
if
it
begins
to
fall
it
can
easily
steer
itself
upward
by
means
of
its
tail
till
the
motion
it
had
acquired
is
nearly
spent
when
it
must
be
renewed
by
a
few
more
strokes
of
the
wings
on
alighting
a
bird
expands
its
wings
and
tail
fully
against
the
air
as
a
ship
in
tacking
round
backs
her
sails
in
order
that
they
may
meet
with
all
the
resistance
possible
in
the
construction
of
the
eyes
of
birds
there
is
a
peculiarity
necessary
to
their
condition
as
they
pass
a
great
portion
of
their
lives
among
thickets
and
hedges
they
are
provided
for
the
defence
of
their
eyes
from
external
injuries
as
well
as
from
the
effects
of
the
light
when
flying
in
opposition
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
with
a
nictating
or
winking
membrane
which
can
at
pleasure
be
drawn
over
the
whole
eye
like
a
curtain
this
covering
is
neither
opaque
nor
wholly
pellucid
but
is
somewhat
transparent
and
it
is
by
its
means
that
the
eagle
is
said
to
be
able
to
gaze
at
the
sun
in
birds
says
a
writer
on
this
subject
we
find
that
the
sight
is
much
more
piercing
extensive
and
exact
than
in
the
other
orders
of
animals
the
eye
is
much
larger
in
proportion
to
the
bulk
of
the
head
than
in
any
of
these
this
is
a
superiority
conferred
upon
them
not
without
a
corresponding
utility
it
seems
even
indispensable
to
their
safety
and
subsistence
were
this
organ
in
birds
dull
or
in
the
least
degree
opaque
they
would
be
in
danger
from
the
rapidity
of
their
motion
of
striking
against
various
objects
in
their
flight
in
this
case
their
celerity
instead
of
being
an
advantage
would
become
an
evil
and
their
flight
be
restrained
by
the
danger
resulting
from
it
indeed
we
may
consider
the
velocity
with
which
an
animal
moves
as
a
sure
indication
of
the
perfection
of
its
vision
among
the
quadrupeds
the
sloth
has
its
sight
greatly
limited
whilst
the
hawk
as
it
hovers
in
the
air
can
espy
a
lark
sitting
on
a
clod
perhaps
at
twenty
times
the
distance
at
which
a
man
or
a
dog
could
perceive
it
amongst
the
many
peculiarities
in
the
construction
of
birds
not
the
least
is
the
mode
by
which
their
respiration
is
accomplished
this
is
effected
by
means
of
which
extend
throughout
the
body
and
adhere
to
the
of
the
bones
these
by
their
motion
force
the
air
through
the
true
lungs
which
are
very
small
and
placed
in
the
uppermost
part
of
the
chest
and
closely
braced
down
to
the
back
and
ribs
the
lungs
which
are
never
expanded
by
air
are
destined
to
the
sole
purpose
of
oxidizing
the
blood
in
the
experiments
made
by
john
hunter
to
discover
the
use
of
this
general
diffusion
of
air
through
the
bodies
of
birds
he
found
that
it
prevents
their
respiration
from
being
stopped
or
interrupted
by
the
rapidity
of
their
motion
through
a
resisting
medium
it
is
well
known
that
in
proportion
to
celerity
of
motion
the
air
becomes
resistive
and
were
it
possible
for
a
man
to
move
with
the
swiftness
of
a
swallow
as
he
is
not
provided
with
an
internal
construction
similar
to
that
of
birds
the
resistance
of
the
air
would
soon
suffocate
him
birds
are
distributed
over
every
part
of
the
globe
being
found
in
the
coldest
as
well
as
the
hottest
regions
although
some
species
are
restricted
to
particular
countries
whilst
others
are
widely
dispersed
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
many
of
them
change
their
abodes
and
migrate
to
climates
better
adapted
to
their
temperaments
or
modes
of
life
for
a
time
than
those
which
they
leave
many
of
the
birds
of
britain
directed
by
an
unerring
instinct
take
their
departure
from
the
island
before
the
commencement
of
winter
and
proceed
to
the
more
congenial
warmth
of
africa
to
return
with
the
next
spring
the
causes
assigned
by
naturalists
for
this
peculiarity
are
either
a
deficiency
of
food
or
the
want
of
a
secure
asylum
for
the
incubation
and
nourishment
of
their
young
their
migrations
are
generally
performed
in
large
companies
and
in
the
day
they
follow
a
leader
which
is
occasionally
changed
during
the
night
many
of
the
tribes
send
forth
a
continual
cry
to
keep
themselves
together
although
one
would
think
that
the
noise
which
must
accompany
their
flight
would
be
sufficient
for
that
purpose
the
flight
of
birds
across
the
mediterranean
was
noticed
three
thousand
years
ago
as
we
find
it
said
in
the
book
of
numbers
in
the
scriptures
that
there
went
forth
a
wind
from
the
lord
and
brought
quails
from
the
sea
and
let
them
fall
upon
the
camp
and
a
journey
round
about
it
to
the
height
of
two
cubits
above
the
earth
if
the
beauty
of
birds
were
not
a
recommendation
to
their
being
universally
admired
their
general
liveliness
gaiety
and
song
would
endear
them
to
mankind
it
appears
however
from
accurate
observations
founded
upon
experiment
that
the
notes
peculiar
to
different
kinds
of
birds
are
altogether
acquired
and
that
they
are
not
innate
any
more
than
language
is
to
man
the
attempt
of
a
nestling
bird
to
sing
has
been
compared
to
the
endeavour
of
a
child
to
talk
the
first
attempts
do
not
seem
to
possess
the
slightest
rudiments
of
the
future
song
but
as
the
bird
grows
older
and
becomes
stronger
it
is
easily
perceived
to
be
aiming
at
acquiring
the
art
of
giving
utterance
to
song
whilst
the
scholar
is
thus
endeavouring
to
form
his
notes
when
he
is
once
sure
of
a
passage
he
usually
raises
his
tone
but
drops
it
again
when
he
finds
himself
unequal
to
the
voluntary
task
he
has
undertaken
many
facts
says
an
ingenious
writer
seem
decisively
to
prove
that
birds
have
no
innate
notes
but
that
like
mankind
the
language
of
those
to
whose
care
they
have
been
committed
at
their
birth
will
be
their
language
in
it
would
appear
however
somewhat
unaccountable
why
in
a
wild
state
they
adhere
so
steadily
to
the
song
of
their
own
species
only
when
the
notes
of
so
many
others
are
to
be
heard
around
them
this
is
said
to
arise
from
the
attention
paid
by
the
nestling
bird
to
the
instructions
of
its
own
parent
only
generally
disregarding
the
notes
of
all
the
rest
persons
however
who
have
an
accurate
ear
and
who
have
given
their
attention
to
the
songs
of
birds
can
frequently
distinguish
some
which
have
their
notes
mixed
with
those
of
another
species
but
this
is
in
general
so
trifling
that
it
can
hardly
be
considered
as
more
than
the
mere
varieties
of
provincial
dialects
in
reference
to
the
food
of
birds
we
find
that
it
varies
as
it
does
in
quadrupeds
according
to
the
species
some
are
altogether
carnivorous
others
as
so
many
of
the
tribes
subsist
on
fish
others
again
on
insects
and
worms
and
others
on
grain
and
fruit
the
extraordinary
powers
of
the
gizzard
of
the
granivorous
tribes
in
comminuting
their
food
so
as
to
prepare
it
for
digestion
would
were
they
not
supported
by
incontrovertible
facts
founded
on
experiment
appear
to
exceed
all
credibility
tin
tubes
full
of
grain
have
been
forced
into
the
stomachs
of
turkeys
and
in
hours
have
been
found
broken
compressed
and
distorted
into
every
shape

small
lancets
very
sharp
both
at

point

left
in
its

for
eight
hours
after
that

the

the

whilst

entire
from
these
facts
it
is
concluded
that
the
stones
so
frequently
found
in
the
stomachs
of
the
feathered
tribes
are
highly
useful
in
assisting
the
gastric
juices
to
grind
down
the
grain
and
other
hard
substances
which
constitute
their
food
the
stones
themselves
being
also
ground
down
and
separated
by
the
powerful
action
of
the
gizzard
are
mixed
with
the
food
and
no
doubt
contribute
very
greatly
to
the
health
as
well
as
to
the
nourishment
of
the
animals
all
birds
being
oviparous
the
eggs
which
they
produce
after
the

of
incubation
or
sitting
for
a

length
of

are
in
the
various
species
different
both
in
figure
and
colour
as
well
as
in
point
of
number
they
contain
the
elements
of
the
future
young
for
the
perfecting
of
which
in
the
incubation
a
bubble
of
air
is
always
placed
at
the
large
end
between
the
shell
and
the
inside
skin
it
is
supposed
that
from
the
heat
communicated
by
the
sitting
bird
to
this
confined
air
its
spring
is
increased
beyond
its
natural
tenor
and
at
the

time
its
parts
are
put
into
motion
by
the
gentle
rarefaction
by
this
means
pressure
and
motion
are
communicated
to
the
parts
of
the

in
some
inscrutable
way
gradually
promote
the
formation
and
growth
of
the
young
till
the
time
comes
for

from

that

avoid
those
that
are

thick

probably
contain

the
odd
number
is
considered
preferable
as
more
easily

it
will
be
as
well
to
mark
the
eggs
you
give
the
hen
to
sit
on
so
that
you
may
know
if
she
lays
any
more
if
she
does
you
must
remove
them
for
if
hatched
at
all
they
would
be
too
late
for
the
brood
if
during
incubation
an
egg
should
be
broken
remove
it
and
take
out
the
remainder
and
cleanse
them
in
water
or
it
is
probable
the
sticky
nature
of
the
contents
of
the
broken
egg
will
make
the
others
cling
to
the
hen
feathers
and
they
too
may
be
fractured
hens
some
hens
are
very
capricious
as
regards
sitting
they
will
make
a
great
fuss
and
keep
pining
for
the
nest
and
when
they
are
permitted
to
take
to
it
they
will
sit
just
long
enough
to
addle
the
eggs
and
then
they
off
again
the
safest
way
to
guard
against
such
annoyance
is
to
supply
the
hen
with
some
eggs
if
she
sits
on
them
a
reasonable
time

the
poor

is
in
a
terrible
fix
an
able
writer
says
assistance
in
hatching
must
not
be
rendered
prematurely
and
thence
unnecessarily
but
only
in
the
case
of
the
chick
being
plainly
unable
to
release
itself
then
indeed
an
addition
may
probably
be
made
to
the
brood
as
great
numbers
are
always
lost
in
this
way
the
chick
makes
a
circular
fracture
at
the
big
end
of
the
egg
and
a
section
of
about
of
the
length
of
the
shell
being
separated
delivers
the
prisoner
provided
there
is
no
obstruction
from
adhesion
of
the
body
to
the
membrane
which
lines
the
shell
between
the
body
of
the
chick
and
the
membrane
of
the
shell
there
exists
a
viscous
fluid
the
white
of
the
egg
thickened
with
the
intense
heat
of
incubation
until
it
becomes
a
positive
glue
when
this
happens
the
feathers
stick
fast
to
the
shell
and
the
chicks
remain
confined
and
must
perish
if
not
released
the
method
of
assistance
to
be
rendered
to
chicks
which
have
a
difficulty
in
releasing
themselves
from
the
shell
is
to
take
the
egg
in
the
hand
and
dipping
the
finger
or
a
piece
of
linen
rag
in
warm
water
to
apply
it
to
the
fastened
parts
until
they
are
loosened
by
the
gluey
substance
becoming
dissolved
and
separated
from
the
feathers
the
chick
then
being
returned
to
the
nest
will
extricate
itself
a
mode
generally
to
be
observed
since
if
violence
were
used
it
would
prove
fatal
nevertheless
breaking
the
shell
may
sometimes
be
necessary
and
separating
with
the
fingers
as
gently
as
may
be
the
membrane
from
the
feathers
which
are
still
to
be
moistened
as
mentioned
above
to
facilitate
the
operation
the
points
of
small
scissors
may
be
useful
and
when
there
is
much
resistance
as
also
apparent
pain
to
the
bird
the
process
must
be
conducted
in
the
gentlest
manner
and
the
shell
separated
into
a
number
of
small
pieces
the
signs
of
a
need
of
assistance
are
the
egg
being
partly
pecked
and
chipped
and
the
cluck
discontinuing
its
efforts
for
five
of
six
hours
weakness
from
cold
may
disable
the
chicken
from
commencing
the
operation
of
pecking
the
shell
which
must
then
be
artificially
performed

the
opinion

medical
faculty

ages

all
countries
that
the
flesh
of
the
young
chicken
is
the
must
delicate
and
easy
to
digest
of
all
animal
food
it
is
less
alkalescent
than
the
flesh
of
any
other
animal
and
its
entire
freedom
from
any
irritating
quality
renders
it
a
fit
dish
for
the
ailing
or
those
whose
stomachs
are
naturally
weak
in
no
animal
however
does
age
work
such
a
change
in
regard
to
the
quality
of
its
flesh
as
it
does
in
domestic
fowls
in
their
infancy
cocks
and
hens
are
equally
tender
and
toothsome
but
as
time
overtakes
them
it
is
the
cock
whose
flesh
toughens
first
a
cock
indeed
is
fit
for
little
else
than
to
be
converted
into
soup
while
a
hen
at
the
same
age
although
sufficiently
substantial
is
not
callous
to
the
insinuations
of
a
as
regards
capons
however
the
rule
respecting
age
does
not
hold
good
there
is
scarcely
to
be
found
a
more
delicious
animal
than
a
capon
age
does
not
dry
up
his
juices
indeed
like
wine
he
seems
but
to
mellow
at
three
years
old
even
he
is
as
tender
as
a
chick
with
the
additional
advantage
of
his
proper
chicken
flavour
being
fully
developed
the
above
remarks
however
concerning
the
capon
only
apply
to
such
as
are
fed
and
not
crammed
the
latter
process
may
produce
a
bird

it
may
weigh
enough
to
satisfy
the
whim

avarice
of
its
stuffer

when

reveal
the
cruel

to
which
it

plain

is
a

greens

browns

the
plumage
of

begins
to
fade

in

months
every
vestige
of
his
finery
has
departed
and
he
is
not
to
be
distinguished
from
his

the
greens

and
the
browns
begin
to
bud
out
again

by

he
is

more

it
is
to
be
regretted
that
domestication
has
seriously
deteriorated
the
moral
character
of
the
duck
in
a
wild
state
he
is
a
faithful
husband
desiring
but
one
wife
and
devoting
himself
to
her
but
no

is

he

makes
nothing
of
owning
ten
or
a

wives
at
a

as

the
females

are

more

a

wades
in
the

up
to
the

having
his
head
covered
with
an
empty
calabash
approaches
the

birds
have
no
suspicion
of
the
nature
of
the
object
which
is
concealed
under
the
calabash
they
suffer
its
approach
and
allow
it
to
move
at
will
among
their
flock
the
man
accordingly
walks
about
in
the
midst
of
his
game
and
whenever
he
pleases
pulls
them
by
the
legs
under
the
water
and
fixes
them
to
his
belt
until
he
has
secured
as
many
as
he
requires
and
then
moves
off
as
he
went
amongst
them
without
exciting
the
slightest
suspicion
of
the
trick
he
has
been
playing

singular
mode
of
is

the
finding

on

heads
and
as
the
ducks
from
seeing
them
constantly
floating
down

regard
them
as
objects
from
which

illustration
in
the
lincolnshire
the
following
interesting
account
of
how
used
to
be
managed
in
the
lincolnshire
fens
was
published
some
years
ago
in
a
work
entitled
the
feathered
tribes
in
the
lakes
to
which
they
resorted
their
favourite
haunts
were
observed
and
in
the
most
sequestered
part
of
a
haunt
a
pipe
or
ditch
was
cut
across
the
entrance
decreasing
gradually
in
width
from
the
entrance
to
the
further
end
which
was
not
more
than
two
feet
wide
the
ditch
was
of
a
circular
form
but
did
not
bend
much
for
the
first
ten
yards
the
banks
of
the
lake
on
each
side
of
the
ditch
were
kept
clear
of
weeds
and
close
herbage
in
order
that
the
ducks
might
get
on
them
to
sit
and
dress
themselves
along
the
ditch
poles
were
driven
into
the
ground
close
to
the
edge
on
each
side
and
the
tops
were
bent
over
across
the
ditch
and
tied
together
the
poles
then
bent
forward
at
the
entrance
to
the
ditch
and
formed
an
arch
the
top
of
which
was
tea
feet
distant
from
the
surface
of
the
water
the
arch
was
made
to
decrease
in
height
as
the
ditch
decreased
in
width
so
that
the
remote
end
was
not
more
than
eighteen
inches
in
height
the
poles
were
placed
about
six
feet
from
each
other
and
connected
by
poles
laid
lengthwise
across
the
arch
and
tied
together
over
the
whole
was
thrown
a
net
which
was
made
fast
to
a
reed
fence
at
the
entrance
and
nine
or
ten
yards
up
the
ditch
and
afterwards
strongly
pegged
to
the
ground
at
the
end
of
the
ditch
furthest
from
the
entrance
was
fixed
what
was
called
a
of
about
four
yards
in
length
of
a
round
form
and
kept
open
by
a
number
of
hoops
about
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
placed
at
a
small
distance
from
each
other
to
keep
it
distended
supposing
the
circular
bend
of
the
ditch
to
be
to
the
right
when
one
stands
with
his
back
to
the
lake
then
on
the
side
a
number
of
reed
fences
were
constructed
called
shootings
for
the
purpose
of
screening
the
from
observation
and
in
such
a
manner
that
the
fowl
in
the
decoy
would
not
be
alarmed
while
he
was
driving
those
that
were
in
the
pipe
these
shootings
which
were
ten
in
number
were
about
four
yards
in
length
and
about
six
feet
high
from
the
end
of
the
last
shooting
a
person
could
not
see
the
lake
owing
to
the
bend
of
the
ditch
and
there
was
then
no
further
occasion
for
shelter
were
it
not
for
these
shootings
the
fowl
that
remained
about
the
mouth
of
the
ditch
would
have
been
alarmed
if
the
person
driving
the
fowl
already
under
the
net
should
have
been
exposed
and
would
have
become
so
shy
as
entirely
to
forsake
the
place
the
decoy
man
dog
and
the
first
thing
the
did
on
approaching
the
ditch
was
to
take
a
piece
of
lighted
peat
or
turf
and
to
hold
it
near
his
mouth
to
prevent
the
birds
from
smelling
him
he
was
attended
by
a
dog
trained
to
render
him
assistance
he
walked
very
silently
about
halfway
up
the
shootings
where
a
small
piece
of
wood
was
thrust
through
the
reed
fence
which
made
an
aperture
just
large
enough
to
enable
him
to
see
if
there
were
any
fowl
within
if
not
he
walked
to
see
if
any
were
about
the
entrance
to
the
ditch
if
there
were
he
stopped
made
a
motion
to
his
dog
and
gave
him
a
piece
of
cheese
to
eat
when
the
dog
went
directly
to
a
hole
through
the
reed
fence
and
the
birds
immediately
flew
off
the
back
into
the
water
the
dog
returned
along
the
bank
between
the
reed
fences
and
came
out
to
his
master
at
another
hole
the
man
then
gave
the
dog
something
more
to
encourage
him
and
the
dog
repeated
his
rounds
till
the
birds
were
attracted
by
his
motions
and
followed
him
into
the
mouth
of
the
ditch
an
operation
which
was
called
them
the
man
now
retreated
further
back
working
the
dog
at
different
holes
until
the
ducks
were
sufficiently
under
the
net
he
then
commanded
his
dog
to
lie
down
under
the
fence
and
going
himself
forward
to
the
end
of
the
ditch
next
the
lake
he
took
off
his
hat
and
gave
it
a
wave
between
the
shootings
all
the
birds
that
were
under
the
net
could
then
see
him
but
none
that
were
in
the
lake
could
the
former
flew
forward
and
the
man
then
ran
to
the
next
shooting
and
waved
his
hat
and
so
on
driving
them
along
until
they
came
into
the
into
which
they
crept
when
they
were
all
in
the
man
gave
the
net
a
twist
so
as
to
prevent
them
getting
back

then

spurs

no

that

belief

was
the

of
the
dorking
and
not
without
at

resembles

the

as

from

the
night
after
they
are
hatched

fed
with

chopped

mixed

fed
for

after
which
give
them
oatmeal
and

mixed
so
as
to
crumble
of
which
the
chickens
are
very
fond
and
thrive
so
fast
that
at

two
months
they
will
be
as
large
as

there
are
who
insist

nothing
beats

cram
their
birds
with

oats

whatever
the
course

favoured

point
they
seem

that
is
that

supposition
the

are

and

the

ignorant
that
there

the

ordered
with

expedition
the

procured

there
was
no

at

and
unluckily
none
could
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
there
was
oil
in
abundance
however
and
the
cook
having
poured
a
certain
quantity
into
his
skillet
put
in
the
fowl
with
a
clove
of
garlic
and
other
seasoning
with
a
little
white
wine
the
best
the
country
afforded
he
then
garnished
it
with
mushrooms
and
served
it
up
hot
this
dish
proved
the
second
conquest
of
the
day
as
the

found
it
most
agreeable
to
his

expressed

his

has
his
fill
of

exercise
and
at

he
comes
smoking
to
the
table
a
dish
for
the
gods
in
the
matter
of
unnaturally
stuffing
and
confining
fowls
mowbray
is
exactly
of
our
opinion
he
says
the
london
as
they
are
termed
are
said
to
be
of
all
others
the
most
expeditious
and
dexterous
feeders
putting
up
a
coop
of
fowls
and
making
them
thoroughly
fat
within
the
space
of
a
fortnight
using
much
grease
and
that
perhaps
not
of
the
most
delicate
kind
in
the
food
in
this
way
i
have
no
boasts
to
make
having
always
found
it
necessary
to
allow
a
considerable
number
of
weeks
for
the
purpose
of
making
fowls
fat
in
coops
in
the
common
way
this
business
is
often
badly
managed
fowls
being
huddled
together
in
a
small
coop
tearing
each
other
to
pieces
instead
of
enjoying
that
repose
which
alone
can
insure
the
object
irregularly
fed
and
cleaned
until
they
become
so
stenched
and
poisoned
in
their
own
excrement
that
their
flesh
actually
smells
and
tastes
when
smoking
upon
the
table
sussex
produces
the
fattest
and
largest
poultry
of
any
county
in
england
and
the
fatting
process
there
most
common
is
to
give
them
a
gruel
made
of
and
bruised
oats
with
which
are
mixed
hog
grease
sugar
and
milk
the
fowls
are
kept
very
warm
and
crammed
morning
and
night
they
are
put
into
the
coop
and
kept
there
two
or
three
days
before
the
cramming
begins

then
it
is
continued

the
best
fowls
to
fatten
the
chicks
most
likely
to
fatten
well
are
those
first
hatched
in
the
brood
and
those
with
the
shortest
legs
fowls
as
a
rule
are
by
far
the
most
difficult
to
fatten
the
most
delicate
sort
are
those
which
are
put
up
to
fatten
as
soon
as
the
hen
forsakes
them
for
as
says
an
old
writer
then
they
will
be
in
fine
condition
and
full
of
flesh
which
flesh
is
afterwards
expended
in
the
exercise
of
foraging
for
food
and
in
the
increase
of
stature
and
it
may
be
a
work
of
some
weeks
to
recover
it
especially
with
young
cocks
but
whether
you
take
them
in
hand
as
chicks
or
not
till
they
are
older
the
three
prime
rules
to
be
observed
are
sound
and
various
food
warmth
and
cleanliness
there
is
nothing
that
a
fatting
fowl
grows
so
fastidious
about
as
his
water
if
water
any
way
foul
be
offered
him
he
will
not
drink
it
but
sulk
with
his
food
and
pine
and
you
all
the
while
wondering
the
reason
why
keep
them
separate
allowing
to
each
bird
as
much
space
as
you
can
spare
spread
the
ground
with
sharp
sandy
gravel
take
care
that
they
are
not
disturbed
in
addition
to
their
regular
diet
of
good
corn
make
them
a
cake
of
ground
oats
or
beans
brown
sugar
milk
and
mutton
suet
let
the
cake
lie
till
it
is
stale
then
crumble
it
and
give
each
bird
a
morning
and
evening
no
entire
grain
should
be
given
to
fowls
during
the
time
they
are
fattening
indeed
the
secret
of
success
lies
in
supplying
them
with
the
most
nutritious
food
without
stint
and
in
such
a
form
that
their
digestive
mills
shall
find
no

the
pouter
this
is
a
very
favourite
pigeon
and
without
doubt
the
most
curious
of
his
species
he
is
a
tail
strong
bird
as
he
had
need
be
to
carry
about
his
great
inflated
crop
frequently
as
large
and
as
round
as
a
turnip
a
perfect
pouter
seen
on
a
windy
day
is
certainly
a
ludicrous
sight
his
feathered
legs
have
the
appearance
of
white
trousers
his
tapering
tail
looks
like
a
coat
his
head
is
entirely
concealed
by
his
immense
windy
protuberance
and
altogether
he
reminds
you
of
a
little
swell
of
a
past
century
staggering
under
a
bale
of
linen
the
most
common
pouters
are
the
blues
buffs
and
whites
or
an
intermixture
of
all
these
various
colours
the
pouter
is
not
a
prolific
breeder
is
a
bad
nurse
and
more
likely
to
degenerate
if
not
repeatedly
crossed
and
with
irish
stock
than
any
other
pigeon
nevertheless
it
is
a
useful
bird
to
keep
if
you
are
founding
a
new
colony
as
it
is
much
attached
to
its
home
and
little
apt
to
stray
consequently
it
is
calculated
to
induce
more
restless
birds
to
fettle
down
and
make
themselves
comfortable
if
you
wish
to
breed
pouters
you
can
not
do
worse
than
intrust
them

the
care
of
their
own
eggs

of

the
wild
pigeon
or
stockdove
is
the
parent
whence
all
the
varieties
of
the
domestic
pigeon
are
derived
in
the
wild
state
it
is
still
found
in
many
parts
of
this
island
making
its
nest
in
the
holes
of
rocks
in
the
hollows
of
trees
or
in
old
towers
but
never
like
the
ringdove
on
branches
the
blue
is
the
variety
principally
reared
for
the
table
in
this
country
and
is
produced
from
our
farmyards
in
great
numbers
when
young
and
still
fed
by
their
parents
they
are
most
preferable
for
the
table
and
are
called
under
six
months
they
are
denominated
and
at
six
months
they
begin
to
breed
their
flesh
is
accounted
savoury
delicate
and
stimulating
and
the
birds
are
considered
to
have
the
highest
flavour
whilst
the
light
are
esteemed
to
have
the
more
delicate
flesh
the
or
the
first
thing
to
be
done
towards
keeping
pigeons
is
to
provide
a
commodious
place
for
their
reception
and
the
next
is
to
provide
the
pigeons
themselves
the
situation
or
size
of
the
dovecot
will
necessarily
depend
on
convenience
but
there
is
one
point
which
must
invariably
be
observed
and
that
is
that
every
pair
of
pigeons
has
two
holes
or
rooms
to
nest
in
this
is
indispensable
as
without
it
there
will
be
no
security
but
the
constant
prospect
of
confusion
breaking
of
eggs
and
the
destruction
of
young
the
proper
place
for
the
is
the
but
it
does
very
well
near
dwellings
stables
brewhouses
bakehouses
or
such
offices
some
persons
keep
pigeons
in
rooms
and
have
them
making
their
nests
on
the
floor
the
object
is
to
escape
the
danger
of
the
young
falling
out
but
in
such
cases
there
is
a
great
risk
of
rats
or
other
vermin
getting
at
the
pigeons
aspect
of
the
the
front
of
the
should
have
a
southwest
aspect
and
if
a
room
be
selected
for
the
purpose
it
is
usual
to
break
a
hole
in
the
roof
of
the
building
for
the
passage
of
the
pigeons
but
which
can
be
closed
at
convenience
a
platform
ought
to
be
laid
at
the
entrance
for
the
pigeons
to
perch
upon
with
some
kind
of
defence
against
strange
cats
which
will
frequently
depopulate
a
whole
dovecot
yet
although
cats
are
dangerous
neighbours
for
the
birds
they
are
necessary
to
defend
them
from
the
approach
of
rats
and
mice
which
will
not
only
suck
the
eggs
but
destroy
the
birds
the
platform
should
be
painted
white
and
renewed
as
the
paint
wears
off
white
being
a
favourite
colour
with
pigeons
and
also
most
conspicuous
as
a
mark
to
enable
them
to
find
their
house
the
boxes
ought
also
to
be
similarly
painted
and
renewed
when
necessary
for
which
purpose
lime
and
water
will
do
very
well
the
necessity
of
as
cleanliness
in
human
habitations
is
of
the
first
importance
so
is
it
in
the
there
the
want
of
it
will
soon
render
the
place
a
nuisance
not
to
be
approached
and
the
birds
both
young
and
old
will
be
so
covered
with
vermin
and
filth
that
they
will
neither
enjoy
health
nor
comforts
whilst
early
mortality
amongst
them
will
be
almost
certain
in
some
cases

is
cleaned

it
should
always
be
done
at
any

some
indeed
assert
that
this
bird
was
known
to
the
ancients
and
that
it
was
served
at
the
of
charlemagne
this
opinion
however
has
been
controverted
by
authorities
who
declare
that
the
french
name
of
the
bird
proves
its
origin
that
the
form
of
the
bird
is
altogether
foreign
and
that
it
is
found
in

state
there
is
but
little
doubt
from
the
information
which
has
been
gained
at
considerable
trouble
that
it
appeared
generally
in
europe
about
the
end
of
the
century
that
it
was
first
imported
into
france
by
jesuits
who
had
been
sent
out
missionaries
to
the
west
and
that
from
france
it
spread
over
europe
to

day
in
many
localities

a
turkey
is
called
a
jesuit
on
the
farms

turkeys
are
very
common
they
are
raised
either
from
eggs
which
have
been
found
or
from
young
ones
caught
in
the
woods
they
thus
preserve
almost
entirely
their
original
plumage

only
became

acclimated

on

perch
on

trees
and
by
rising
from
branch
to
branch
attain
the
height
they
desire
they
usually
mount
to
the
highest
tops
apparently
from
an
instinctive
conception
that
the
loftier
they
are
the
further
they
are
out

fly
awkwardly

hunting

was
one
of

of
the
natives

was

of
any
kind
was
plentiful

would
send

dog
into

flock
the
turkeys
no
sooner
perceived
their
enemy
than
they
would
run
off
at
full
speed
and
with
such
swiftness
that
they
would
leave
the
dog
far
behind
he
however
would
follow
in
their
wake
and
as
they
could
not
for
a
great
length
of
time
continue
at
their
speed
they
were
at
last
forced
to
seek
shelter
in
the
trees
there
they
would
sit
spent
with
fatigue

the
hunters
would

quantity

we
will
endeavour
to
assist
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
the
gentle
art
of
carving
and
also
those
who
are
but
slightly
acquainted
with
it
by
simply
describing
the
rules
to
follow
and
referring
to
the
illustrations
of
each
dish
which
will
further
help
to
bring
light
to
the
minds
of
the
uninitiated
if
the
bird
be
a
young
duckling
it
may
be
carved
like
a
fowl
by
first
taking
off
the
leg
and
the
wing
on
either
side
as
described
at
no
but
in
cases
where
the
duckling
is
very
small
it
will
be
as
well
not
to
separate
the
leg
from
the
wing
as
they
will
not
then
form
too
large
a
portion
for
a
single
serving
after
the
legs
and
wings
are
disposed
of
the
remainder
of
the
duck
will
be
also
carved
in
the
same
manner
as
a
fowl
and
not
much
difficulty
will
be
experienced
as
ducklings
are
tender
and
the
joints
are
easily
broken
by
a
little
gentle
forcing
or
penetrated
by
the
knife
in
cases
where
the
duck
is
a
large
bird
the
better
plan
to
pursue
is
then
to
carve
it
like
a
goose
that
is
by
cutting
pieces
from
the
breast
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
lines
marked
from
to
commencing
to
carve
the
slices
close
to
the
wing
and
then
proceeding
upwards
from
that
to
the
breastbone
if
more
should
be
wanted
than
can
be
obtained
from
both
sides
of
the
breast
then
the
legs
and
wings
must
be
attacked
in
the
same
way
as
is
described
in
connection
with
carving
a
fowl
it
may
be
here
remarked
that
as
the
legs
of
a
duck
are
placed
far
more
backward
than
those
of
a
fowl
their
position
causing
the
waddling
motion
of
the
bird
the
will
be
found
considerably
nearer
towards
the
backbone
than
in
a
chicken
this
is
the
only
difference
worth
mentioning
the
carver
should
ask
each
guest
if
a
portion
of
stuffing
would
be
agreeable
and
in
order
to
get
at
this
a
cut
should
be
made
below
the
breast
as
shown
by
the
line
from
to
at
the
part
called
the
apron
and
the
spoon
inserted
as
described
in
the
recipe
it
is
an
excellent
plan
when
a
couple
of
ducks
are
served
to
have
one
with
and
the
other
without
stuffing
as
to
the
prime
parts
of
a
duck
it
has
been
said
that
the
wing
of
a
flier
and
the
leg
of
a
swimmer
are
severally
the
best
portions
some
persons
are
fond
of
the
feet
of
the
duck
and
in
trussing
these
should
never
be
taken
off
the
leg

the

which
should
be
gently
forced
away
from
the
body
of
the

the
joint
being
thus
discovered
the
carver
can
readily
cut
through
it
and
the
leg
can
be
served
when
the
leg
is

as
that
shown
in
the
annexed
woodcut
the
legs

on
either
side
having

off

should
draw
his
knife
through
the
flesh
in
the
direction
of
the

by
this

the

can
be

merrythought
close
under
the
upper
part
of

in
order
to
free
these
from

they
must
also
be
raised
by
the
knife
at
their
broad
end
and
turned
from
the
body
towards
the
breastbone
until
the
shorter
piece
of

shown
in

breaks
off

now
be

by
cutting
through

will
offer
little
impediment
the

now
to
be
taken
off
and
to
do
this
the
lower
end
of
the
back
should
be
turned
from

carver
who
should
press
the
point
of
the
knife
through
the
top
of
the
backbone
near
the
centre
bringing
it
down
towards
the
end
of
the
back
completely
through
the
bone
if
the
knife
is
now
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
the
joint
will
be
easily
separated
from
the
vertebra
the
backbone
being
now
uppermost
the
fork
should
be
pressed
firmly
down
on
it
whilst
at
the
same
time
the
knife
should
be
employed
in
raising
up
the
lower
small
end
of
the
fowl
towards
the
fork
and
thus
the
back
will
be
dislocated

its
middle
the

are
esteemed
the
prime
parts
of

served
to
the
ladies

whom
legs
except
as
a

of
paramount
necessity
should
not
be
given
byron

it
as
one
reason
why
he
did
not
like
dining
with
ladies
that
they
always
had
the
wings
of
the
fowls
which
he
himself
preferred
we
heard
a
gentleman
who
when
he
might
have
had
a
wing
declare
his
partiality
for
a
leg
saying
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
eat
legs
for
so
long
a
time
that
he
had
at
last
come
to
like
them
better
than
the
other
more
prized
parts

generally
speaking
it
is
not
necessary
so
completely
to
cut
up
a

as
we
have
described
in
the
preceding
paragraphs
unless
indeed
a
large
family
party
is
assembled
and
there
are
a
number
of
little
mouths
to
be

or
some
other
such

the

describing

it
may
be
added
that
the

being
considered
a
delicacy
should
be
divided
and
one
half
served
with

to
an
inexperienced
carver
especially
if
there
is
a

the
beginning
of
the
task
however
is
not
in
any
way
difficult
slices
not
too
thick
or
too
thin
should
be
carved
from
the
breast
in
the
direction
of
the
line
from
to
after
the
first
slice
has
been
cut
a
hole
should

part
called
the
apron
passing
it
round
the
line
as
indicated
by
the
figures
here
the

is
located
and
some
of
this
should
be
served
on
each
plate
unless
it
is
discovered
that
it
is
not
agreeable
to
the
taste
of
some
one
guest
if
the
carver
manages
cleverly
he
will
be
able
to
cut
a
very
large
number
of
fine
slices
off
the
breast
and
the
more
so
if
he
commences
close
down
by
the
wing

carves
upwards
towards
the
ridge
of
the
breastbone
as
many
slices
as
can
be
taken
from

being
carved
the
wings
should
be
cut
off

the
same
process
as
described
in
carving
boiled
fowl
is
made
use
of
in
this
instance
only
more
dexterity
and
greater
force
will
most
probably
be
required
the
shape
of
the
leg
when
disengaged
from
the
body
of
the
goose
should
be
like
that
shown
in
the
accompanying
engraving
it
will
be
necessary
perhaps
in
taking
off
the
leg
to
turn
the
goose
on
its
side
and
then
pressing
down
the
small
end
of

under
it
from

quite
down

the
leg
being

turned
back

must

through

joint
loosening
the
from
its
socket
the
merrythought
which
in
a
goose
is
not
so
large
as
might
be
expected
is
disengaged
in
the
same
way
as
that
of
a

under
it

pressing
it
backwards

the
of

we

freed
by
the

process
as
are

may
be
said
of
all
the
other
parts
of
this

esteemed

general
observations
on
game
the
common
law
of
england
has
a
maxim
that
goods
in
which
no
person
can
claim
any
property
belong
by
his
or
her
prerogative
to
the
king
or
queen
accordingly
those
animals
those
which
come
under
the
denomination
of
game
are
in
our
laws
styled
his
or
her
majesty
and
may
therefore
as
a
matter
of
course
be
granted
by
the
sovereign
to
another
in
consequence
of
which
another
may
prescribe
to
possess
the
same
within
a
certain
precinct
or
lordship
from
this
circumstance
arose
the
right
of
lords
of
manors
or
others
to
the
game
within
their
respective
liberties
and
to
protect
these
species
of
animals
the
game
laws
were
originated
and
still
remain
in
force
there
are
innumerable
acts
of
parliament
inflicting
penalties
on
persons
who
may
illegally
kill
game
and
some
of
them
are
very
severe
but
they
can
not
be
said
to
answer
their
end
nor
can
it
be
expected
that
they
ever
will
whilst
there
are
so
many
persons
of
great
wealth
who
have
not
otherwise
the
means
of
procuring
game
except
by
purchase
and
who
will
have
it
these
must
necessarily
encourage
poaching
which
to
a
very
large
extent
must
continue
to
render
all
game
laws
nugatory
as
to
their
intended
effects
upon
the
rustic
population
the
object
of
these
laws
however
is
not
wholly
confined
to
the
restraining
of
the
illegal
sportsman
even
qualified
or
privileged
persons
must
not
kill
game
at
all
seasons
during
the
day
the
hours
allowed
for
sporting
are
from
one
hour
before
sunrise
till
one
hour
after
sunset
whilst
the
time
of
killing
certain
species
is
also
restricted
to
certain
seasons
for

the
season
for
is
from
december
to

the
exercise
or
diversion
of
pursuing
beasts
of
game
is
called
hunting
which
to
this
day
is
followed
in

contrary

rudest

the
most
obvious
manner
of
acquiring
human
support
before
the
agricultural
arts

in
any
degree
advanced
it
is
an
employment
however
requiring
both
art
and
contrivance
as
well
as
a
certain
fearlessness
of
character
combined
with
the
power
of
considerable
physical
endurance
without
these
success
could
not
be
very
great
but
at
best
the
occupation
is
usually
accompanied
with
rude
and
turbulent
habits
and
when
combined
with
these
it
constitutes
what
is
termed
the
savage
state
of
man
as
culture
advances
and
as
the
soil
proportionably
becomes
devoted
to
the
plough
or
to
the
sustenance
of
the
tamer
or
more
domesticated
animals
the
range
of
the
huntsman
is
proportionably
limited
so
that
when
a
country
has
attained
to
a
high
state
of
cultivation
hunting
becomes
little

amusement

was

that
even
during

he
took
with
him
sixty
couples
of
and
as
many
and
every
day
amused
himself
either
with
hunting
or
hawking
great
in
wisdom
as
the

was
much
addicted
to

of

asserted
that

precious
time
was
divided
between

fair
weather
to
the
second

dull
and
to
the
third

cloudy
from
his
days
down
to
the
present
the
sports
of
the
field
have
continued
to
hold
their
high
reputation
not
only
for
the
promotion
of
health
but
for
helping
to
form
that
manliness
of
character
which
enters
so
largely
into
the
composition
of
the
sons
of
the
british
soil
that
it
largely
helps
to
do
this
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
late
duke
of
grafton
when
hunting
was
on
one
occasion
thrown
into
a
ditch
a
young
curate
engaged
in
the
same
chase
cried
out
lie
still
my
lord
leapt
over
him
and
pursued
his
sport
such
an
apparent
want
of
feeling
might
be
expected
to
have
been
resented
by
the
duke
but
not
so
on
his
being
helped
up
by
his
attendant
he
said
that
man
shall
have
the
first
good
living
that
falls
to
my
disposal
had
he
stopped
to
have
given
me
his
sympathy
i
never
would
have
given
him
anything
such
was
the
manly
sentiment
of
the
duke
who
delighted
in
the
exemplification
of
a
spirit
similarly
ardent
as
his
own
in
the
sport
and
above
the
baseness
of
an
assumed
sorrow
that
hunting
has
in
many
instances
been
carried
to
an
excess
is
well
known
and
the
match
given
by
the
prince
esterhazy
regent
of
hungary
on
the
signing
of
the
treaty
of
peace
with
france
is
not
the
least
extraordinary
upon
record
on
that
occasion
there
were
killed
deer
wild
boars
hares
and
foxes
this
was
the
achievement
of
one
day
enormous
however
as
this
slaughter
may
appear
it
is
greatly
inferior
to
that
made
by
the
contemporary
king
of
naples
on
a
hunting
expedition
that
sovereign
had
a
larger
extent
of
ground
at
his
command
and
a
longer
period
for
the
exercise
of
his
talents
consequently
his
sport
if
it
can
so
be
called
was
proportionably
greater
it
was
pursued
during
his
journey
to
vienna
in
austria
bohemia
and
moravia
when
he
killed
bears
boars
deer
does
roebucks
rabbits
wolves
badgers
hares
and
foxes
in
birds
during
the
same
expedition
he
killed
pheasants
and
partridges
such
an
amount
of
destruction
can
hardly
be
called
sport
it
resembles
more
the
indiscriminate
slaughter
of
a
where
the
scientific
engines
of
civilized
warfare
are
brought
to
bear
upon
defenceless
savages
deer
and
hares
may
be
esteemed
as
the
only
animals
now
hunted
in
britain
for
the
table
and
even
those
are
not
followed
with
the
same
ardour
as
they
were
wont
to
be
still
there
is
no
country
in
the
world
where
the
sport
of
hunting
on
horseback
is
carried
to
such
an
extent
as
in
great
britain
and
where
the
pleasures
of
the
chase
are
so
well
understood
and
conducted
on
such
purely
scientific
principles
the
fox
of
all
the
beasts
of
the
field
is
now
considered
to
afford
the
best
sport
for
this
it
is
infinitely
superior
to
the
stag
for
the
real
sportsman
can
only
enjoy
that
chase
when
the
deer
is
sought
for
and
found
like
other
game
which
are
pursued
with
hounds
in
the
case
of
finding
an
outlying
which
is
unharboured
in
this
manner
great
sport
is
frequently
obtained
but
this
is
now
rarely
to
be
met
with
in
britain
in
reference
to
it
is
much
followed
in
many
parts
of
this
and
the
sister
island
but
by
the
true
foxhunter
it
is
considered
as
a
sport
only
fit
to
be
pursued
by
women
and
old
men
although
it
is
less
dangerous
and
exciting
than
the
however
it
has
great
charms
for
those
who
do
not
care
for
the
hard
riding
which
the
other
requires
the
art
of
taking
or
killing
birds
is
called
fowling
and
is
either
practised
as
an
amusement
by
persons
of
rank
or
property
or
for
a
livelihood
by
persons
who
use
nets
and
other
apparatus
when
practised
as
an
amusement
it
principally
consists
of
killing
them
with
a
light
firearm
called
a
and
the
sport
is
secured
to
those
who
pursue
it
by
the
game
laws
the
other
means
by
which
birds
are
taken
consist
in
imitating
their
voices
or
leading
them
by
other
artifices
into
situations
where
they
become
entrapped
by
nets
birdlime
or
otherwise
for
taking
large
numbers
of
birds
the
pipe
or
call
is
the
most
common
means
employed
and
this
is
done
during
the
months
of
september
and
october
we
will
here
briefly
give
a
description
of
the
pursued
in
this
sport
a
thin
wood
is
usually
the
spot
chosen
and
under
a
tree
at
a
little
distance
from
the
others
a
cabin
is
erected
and
there
are
only
such
branches
left
on
the
tree
as
are
necessary
for
the
placing
of
the
birdlime
and
which
are
covered
with
it
around
the
cabin
are
placed
avenues
with
twisted
perches
also
covered
with
birdlime
having
thus
prepared
all
that
is
necessary
the
birdcatcher
places
himself
in
the
cabin
and
at
sunrise
and
sunset
imitates
the
cry
of
a
small
bird
calling
the
others
to
its
assistance
supposing
that
the
cry
of
the
owl
is
imitated
immediately
different
kinds
of
birds
will
flock
together
at
the
cry
of
their
common
enemy
when
at
every
instant
they
will
be
seen
falling
to
the
ground
their
wings
being
of
no
use
to
them
from
their
having
come
in
contact
with
the
birdlime
the
cries
of
those
which
are
thus
situated
now
attract
others
and
thus
are
large
numbers
taken
in
a
short
space
of
time
if
owls
were
themselves
desired
to
be
taken
it
is
only
during
the
night
that
this
can
be
done
by
counterfeiting
the
squeak
of
the
mouse
larks
other
birds
and
are
sometimes
taken
by
nets
but
to
describe
fully
the
manner
in
which
this
is
done
would
here
occupy
too
much
space
feathered
game
have
from
time
immemorial
given
gratification
to
the
palate
of
man
with
the
exception
of
birds
of
prey
and
some
other
species
moses
permitted
his
people
to
eat
them
and
the
egyptians
made
offerings
to
their
priests
of
their
most
delicate
birds
the
ancient
greeks
commenced
their
repasts
with
little
roasted
birds
and
feathered
game
amongst
the
romans
was
served
as
the
second
course
indeed
several
of
the
ancient
of
the
imperial
city
were
so
fond
of
game
that
they
brought
themselves
to
ruin
by
eating
flamingoes
and
pheasants
some
modern
nations
the
french
among
others
says
monsieur
soyer
formerly
ate
the
heron
crane
crow
stork
swan
cormorant
and
bittern
the
first
three
especially
were
highly
esteemed
and
laillevant
cook
of
charles
teaches
us
how
to
prepare
these
meagre
tough
birds
belon
says
that
in
spite
of
its
revolting
taste
when
unaccustomed
to
it
the
bittern
is
however
among
the
delicious
treats
of
the
french
this
writer
also
asserts
that
a
falcon
or
a
vulture
either
roasted
or
boiled
is
excellent
eating
and
that
if
one
of
these
birds
happened
to
kill
itself
in
flying
after
game
the
falconer
instantly
cooked
it
lebaut
calls
the
heron
a
royal
viand
the
heron
was
hunted
by
the
hawk
and
the
sport
of
hawking
is
usually
placed
at
the
head
of
those
amusements
that
can
only
be
practised
in
the
country
this
precedency
it
probably
obtained
from
its
being
a
pastime
to
generally
followed
by
the
nobility
not
in
great
britain
only
but
likewise
on
the
continent
in
former
times
persons
of
high
rank
rarely
appeared
in
public
without
their
dogs
and
their
hawks
the
latter
they
carried
with
them
when
they
journeyed
from
one
country
to
another
and
sometimes
even
took
them
to
battle
with
them
and
would
not
part
with
them
when
taken
prisoners
even
to
obtain
their
own
liberty
such
birds
were
esteemed
as
the
ensigns
of
nobility
and
no
action
was
reckoned
more
dishonourable
in
a
man
of
rank
than
that
of
giving
up
his
hawk
we
have
already
alluded
to
the
hunting
propensities
of
our
own
edward
and
we
may
also
allude
to
his
being
equally
addicted
to
hawking
according
to
froissart
when
this
sovereign
invaded
france
he
took
with
him
thirty
falconers
on
horseback
who
had
charge
of
his
hawks
and
every
day
as
his
royal
fancy
inclined
him
he
either
hunted
or
went
to
the
river
for
the
purpose
of
hawking
in
the
great
and
powerful
the
pursuit
of
game
as
a
sport
is
allowable
but
in
those
who
have
to
earn
their
bread
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
it
is
to
be
condemned
in
burton
anatomy
of
melancholy
we
find
a
humorous
story
told
by
poggius
the
florentine
who
reprobates
this
folly
in
such
persons
it
is
this
a
physician
of
milan
that
cured
madmen
had
a
pit
of
water
in
his
house
in
which
he
kept
his
patients
some
up
to
the
knees
some
to
the
girdle
some
to
the
chin
modo
as
they
were
more
or
less
affected
one
of
them
by
chance
that
was
well
recovered
stood
in
the
door
and
seeing
a
gallant
pass
by
with
a
hawk
on
his
fist
well
mounted
with
his
spaniels
after
him
would
needs
know
to
what
use
all
this
preparation
served
he
made
answer
to
kill
certain
fowl
the
patient
demanded
again
what
his
fowl
might
be
worth
which
he
killed
in
a
year
he
replied
five
or
ten
crowns
and
when
he
urged
him
further
what
his
dogs
horse
and
hawks
stood
him
in
he
told
him
four
hundred
crowns
with
that
the
patient
bade
him
begone
as
he
loved
his
life
and
welfare
for
if
our
master
come
and
find
thee
here
he
will
put
thee
in
the
pit
amongst
the
madmen
up
to
the
chin
thus
reproving
the
madness
of
such
men
as
will
spend
themselves
in
those
vain
sports
to
the
neglect
of
their
business
and
necessary
affairs
as
the
inevitable
result
of
social
progress
is
at
least
to
limit
if
not
entirely
to
suppress
such
sports
as
we
have
here
been
treating
of
much
of
the
romance
of
country
life
has
passed
away
this
is
more
especially
the
case
with
falconry
which
had
its
origin
about
the
middle
of
the
fourth
century
although
lately
some
attempts
have
been
rather
successfully
made
to
institute
a
revival
of
the
gentle
art
of
hawking
julius
firmicus
who
lived
about
that
time
is
so
far
as
we
can
find
the
first
latin
author
who
speaks
of
falconers
and
the
art
of
teaching
one
species
of
birds
to
fly
after
and
catch
others
the
occupation
of
these
functionaries
has
now
however
all
but
ceased
new
and
nobler
efforts
characterize
the
aims
of
mankind
in
the
development
of
their
civilization
and
the
sports
of
the
field
have
to
a
large
extent
been
superseded
by
other
exercises

may
be
less
healthful
and
invigorating
but
certainly
more
elegant
intellectual
and
humanizing

the

the
male

is
called
a
mallard
and
the
young
ones
are
called
flappers
the
time
to
try
to
find
a

of

is
about
the
month
of
july
among
the
rushes
of
the
deepest

most
retired
parts
of
some
brook

stream
where
if
the

bird
is
sprung
it
may
be
taken
as
a
certainty
that
its
brood
is
not
far
off
when
once
found
flappers
are
easily
killed
as
they
attain
their
full
growth
before
their
wings
are
fledged
consequently
the
sport
is
more
like
hunting
than
shooting
birds

assume
the

ducks

very
rare
in

the
landrail
the
landrail
or
this
bird
is
migratory
in
its
habits
yet
from
its
formation
it
seems
ill
adapted
for
long
aërial
passages
its
wings
being
short
and
placed
so
forward
out
of
the
centre
of
gravity
that
it
flies
in
an
extremely
heavy
and
embarrassed
manner
and
with
its
legs
hanging
down
when
it
alights
it
can
hardly
be
sprung
a
second
time
as
it
runs
very
fast
and
seems
to
depend
for
its
safety
more
on
the
swiftness
of
its
feet
than
the
celerity
of
its
wings
it
makes
its
appearance
in
england
about
the
same
time
as
the
quail
that
is
in
the
months
of
april
and
may
and
frequents
the
same
places
its
singular
cry
is
first
heard
when
the
grass
becomes
long
enough
to
shelter
it
and
it
continues
to
be
heard
until
the

is
cut
the
bird
however
is
seldom
seen
for
it
constantly
skulks
among
the
thickest
portions
of
the
herbage
and
runs
so
nimbly
through
it
doubling
and
winding
in
every
direction
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
near
it
it
leaves
this
island
before
the
winter
and
repairs
to
other
countries
in
search
of
its
food
which
principally
consists
of
slugs
large
numbers
of
which
it
destroys
it
is
very
common
in

whilst
migrating
to
this

is

in
great
numbers
in

this

i
have
seen
it
often
says
a

an
accurate
observer

nature

once
in
particular
i
saw
an
extraordinary
instance
of
an
old
solicitude
to
save
its
brood
as
i
was
hunting
with
a
young
pointer
the
dog
ran
on
a
brood
of
very
small
partridges
the
old
bird
cried
fluttered
and
ran
tumbling
along
just
before
the
dog
nose
till
she
had
drawn
him
to
a
considerable
distance
when
she
took
wing
and
flew
still
further
off
but
not
out
of
the
field
on
this
the
dog
returned
to
me
near
the
place
where
the
young
ones
lay
concealed
in
the
grass
which
the
old
bird
no
sooner
perceived
than
she
flew
back
to
us
settled
just
before
the
dog
nose
again
and
by
rolling
and
tumbling
about
drew
off
his
attention
from
her
young
and
thus
preserved
her
brood
a
second
time
i
have
also
seen
when
a
kite
has
been
hovering

the

in

must
except
perhaps
the

whose

we
eat

again
are

here
we
may
mention
particularly
the

the

three

after
it

it
then
has
no

a

a
quail
would
surpass
it

aroma
kept
however
a

length

it
flies
in

imparts
to

a
bitter

altogether
an

came
to
be

have
the

at

that

roast
hare
the
grand
carver
of
olden
times
a
functionary
of
no
ordinary
dignity
was
pleased
when
he
had
a
hare
to
manipulate
for
his
skill
and
grace
had
an
opportunity
of
display
à
la
may
possibly
erewhile
save
modern
gentlemen
the
necessity
of
learning
the
art
which
was
in
auld
lang
syne
one
of
the
necessary
accomplishments
of
the
youthful
squire
but
until
become
universal
or
till
we
see
the
office
of
grand
carver
once
more
instituted
it
will
be
well
for
all
to
learn
how
to
assist
at
the
carving
of
this
dish
which
if
not
the
most
elegant
in
appearance
is
a
very
general
favourite
the
hare
having
its
head
to
the
left
as
shown
in
the
woodcut
should
be
first
served
by
cutting
slices
from
each
side
of
the
backbone
in
the
direction
of
the
lines
from
to
after
these
prime
parts
are
disposed
of
the
leg
should
next
be
disengaged
by
cutting
round
the
line
indicated
by
the
figures
to
the
shoulders
will
then
be
taken
off
by
passing
the
knife
round
from
to
the
back
of
the
hare
should
now
be
divided
by
cutting
quite
through
its
spine
as
shown
by
the
line
to
taking
care
to
feel
with
the
point
of
the
knife
for
a
joint
where
the
back
may
be
readily
penetrated
it
is
the
usual
plan
not
to
serve
any
bone
in
helping
hare
and
thus
the
flesh
should
be
sliced
from
the
legs
and
placed
alone
on
the
plate
in
large
establishments
and
where
are
kept
it
is
often
the
case
that
the
backbone
of
the
hare
especially
in
old
animals
is
taken
out
and
then
the
process
of
carving
is
of
course
considerably
facilitated
a
great
point
to
be
remembered
in
connection
with
carving
hare
is
that
plenty
of
gravy
should
accompany
each
helping
otherwise
this
dish
which
is
naturally
dry
will
lose
half
its
flavour
and
so
become
a
failure
stuffing
is
also
served
with
it

the
ears
which
should
be
nicely
crisp
and
the
brains
of
the
hare
are
esteemed
as
delicacies
by
many
connoisseurs
partridges
illustration
roast
partridges
there
are
several
ways
of
carving
this
most
familiar
game
bird
the
more
usual
and
summary
mode
is
to
carry
the
knife
sharply
along
the
top
of
the
breastbone
of
the
bird
and
cut
it
quite
through
thus
dividing
it
into
two
precisely
equal
and
similar
parts
in
the
same
manner
as
carving
a
pigeon
no
another
plan
is
to
cut
it
into
three
pieces
by
severing
a
small
wing
and
leg
on
either
side
from
the
body
by
following
the
line
to
in
the
upper
woodcut
thus
making
helpings
when
the
breast
will
remain
for
a
third
plate
the
most
elegant
manner
is
that
of
thrusting
back
the
body
from
the
legs
and
then
cutting
through
the
breast
in
the
direction
shown
by
the
line

this

more
small
helpings

the

kingdoms
says
hogg
in
his
natural
history
of
the
vegetable
kingdom
may
be
aptly
compared
to
the
primary
colours
of
the
prismatic
spectrum
which
are
so
gradually
and
intimately
blended
that
we
fail
to
discover
where
the
one
terminates
and
where
the
other
begins
if
we
had
to
deal
with
yellow
and
blue
only
the
eye
would
easily
distinguish
the
one
from
the
other
but
when
the
two
are
blended
and
form
green
we
can
not
tell
where
the
blue
ends
and
the
yellow
begins
and
so
it
is
in
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
if
our
powers
of
observation
were
limited
to
the
highest
orders
of
animals
and
plants
if
there
were
only
mammals
birds
reptiles
fishes
and
insects
in
the
one
and
trees
shrubs
and
herbs
in
the
other
we
should
then
be
able
with
facility
to
define
the
bounds
of
the
two
kingdoms
but
as
we
descend
the
scale
of
each
and
arrive
at
the
lowest
forms
of
animals
and
plants
we
there
meet
with
bodies
of
the
simplest
structure
sometimes
a
mere
cell
whose
organization
modes
of
development
and
reproduction
are
so
anomalous
and
partake
so
much
of
the
character
of
both
that
we
can
not
distinguish
whether
they
are
plants
or
whether
they
are
animals
whilst
it
is
difficult
to
determine
where
the
animal
begins
and
the
vegetable
ends
it
is
as
difficult
to
account
for
many
of
the
singularities
by
which
numbers
of
plants
are
characterized
this
however
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
a
matter
of
surprise
when
we
recollect
that
so
far
as
it
is
at
present
known
the
vegetable
kingdom
is
composed
of
upwards
of
species
of
plants
of
this
amazing
number
the
lichens
and
the
mosses
are
of
the
simplest
and
hardiest
kinds
these
indeed
may
be
considered
as
the
very
creators
of
the
soil
they
thrive
in
the
coldest
and
most
sterile
regions
many
of
them
commencing
the
operations
of
nature
in
the
growth
of
vegetables
on
the
barest
rocks
and
receiving
no
other
nourishment
than
such
as
may
be
supplied
to
them
by
the
simple
elements
of
air
and
rain
when
they
have
exhausted
their
period
in
such
situations
as
have
been
assigned
them
they
pass
into
a
state
of
decay
and
become
changed
into
a
very
fine
mould
which
in
the
active
spontaneity
of
nature
immediately
begins
to
produce
other
species
which
in
their
turn
become
food
for
various
mosses
and
also
rot
this
process
of
growth
and
decay
being
from
time
to
time
continued
forms
a
soil
sufficient
for
the
maintenance
of
larger
plants
which
also
die
and
decay
and
so
increase
the
soil
until
it
becomes
deep
enough
to
sustain
an
oak
or
even
the
weight
of
a
tropical
forest
to
create
soil
amongst
rocks
however
must
not
be
considered
as
the
only
end
of
the
lichen
different
kinds
of
it
minister
to
the
elegant
arts
in
the
form
of
beautiful
dyes
thus
the
is
used
to
communicate
to
silk
and
wool
various
shades
of
purple
and
crimson
which
greatly
enhance
the
value
of
these
materials
this
species
is
chiefly
imported
from
the
canary
islands
and
when
scarce
as
an
article
of
commerce
has
brought
as
much
as
per
ton
in
the
vicinity
of
lichens
the
musci
or
mosses
are
generally
to
be
found
indeed
wherever
vegetation
can
be
sustained
there
they
are
affording
protection
to
the
roots
and
seeds
of
more
delicate
vegetables
and
by
their
spongy
texture
retaining
a
moisture
which
preserves
other
plants
from
the
withering
drought
of
summer
but
even
in
winter
we
find
them
enlivening
by
their
verdure
the
cold
bosom
of
nature
we
see
them
abounding
in
our
pastures
and
our
woods
attaching
themselves
to
the
living
and
still
more
abundantly
to
the
dead
trunks
and
branches
of
trees
in
marshy
places
they
also
abound
and
become
the
medium
of
their
conversion
into
fruitful
fields
this
is
exemplified
by
the
manner
in
which
are
formed
on
the
surface
of
these
we
find
them
in
a
state
of
great
life
and
vigour
immediately
below
we
discover
them
more
or
less
in
a
state
of
decomposition
and
still
deeper
we
find
their
stems
and
branches
consolidated
into
a
light
brown
peat
thus
are
extensive
tracts
formed
ultimately
to
be
brought
into
a
state
of
cultivation
and
rendered
subservient
to
the
wants
of
man
when
nature
has
found
a
soil
her
next
care
is
to
perfect
the
growth
of
her
seeds
and
then
to
disperse
them
whilst
the
seed
remains
confined
in
its
capsule
it
can
not
answer
its
purpose
hence
when
it
is
sufficiently
ripe
the
pericardium
opens
and
lets
it
out
what
must
strike
every
observer
with
surprise
is
how
nuts
and
shells
which
we
can
hardly
crack
with
our
teeth
or
even
with
a
hammer
will
divide
of
themselves

make
way

elastic
jerk

we
are
all
aware
however
that
many
seeds
those
of
the
most
composite
flowers
as
of
the
thistle
and
dandelion
are
endowed
with
what
have
not
been
inappropriately
called
wings
these
consist
of
a
beautiful
down
by
which
they
are
enabled
to
float
in
the
air
and
to
be
transported
sometimes
to
considerable
distances
from

parent

that
produced

downy
tuft

means
by

they

the
squirrel
which
is
an
extensive
planter
of
oaks
nay
it
may
be
regarded
as
having
in
some
measure
been
one
of
the
creators
of
the
british
navy
we
have
read
of
a
gentleman
who
was
walking
one
day
in
some
woods
belonging
to
the
duke
of
beaufort
near
troy
house
in
monmouthshire
when
his
attention
was
arrested
by
a
squirrel
sitting
very
composedly
upon
the
ground
he
stopped
to
observe
its
motions
when
in
a
short
time
the
little
animal
suddenly
quitted
its
position
and
darted
to
the
top
of
the
tree
beneath
which
it
had
been
sitting
in
an
instant
it
returned
with
an
acorn
in
its
mouth
and
with
its
paws
began
to
burrow
in
the
earth
after
digging
a
small
hole
it
therein
deposited
an
acorn
which
it
hastily
covered
and
then
darted
up
the
tree
again
in
a
moment
it
was
down
with
another
which
it
buried
in
the
same
manner
and
so
continued
its
labour
gathering
and
burying
as
long
as
the
gentleman
had
patience
to
watch
it
this
industry
in
the
squirrel
is
an
instinct
which
directs
it
to
lay
up
a
store
of
provision
for
the
winter
and
as
it
is
probable
that
its
memory
is
not
sufficiently
retentive
to
enable
it
to
recollect
all
the
spots
in
which
it
deposits
its
acorns
it
no
doubt
makes
some
slips
in
the
course
of
the
season
and
loses
some
of
them
these
few
spring
up
and
are
in
time
destined
to
supply
the
place
of
the
parent
tree
thus
may
the
sons
of
britain
in
some
degree
consider
themselves
to
be
indebted
to
the
industry
and
defective
memory
of
this
little
animal
for
the
production
of
some
of
those
wooden
walls
which
have
for
centuries
been
the
national
pride
and
which
have
so
long
braved

battle
and
the
breeze
on
the
broad
bosom
of
the
great
deep
in
every
quarter
of
the
civilized
globe
as
with
the
squirrel
so
with

and

which
plant

the

and
probably
forget

this
size
is
generally
estimated
at
years
growth
which
number
being
subtracted
from
the

rather
more

the

was
by
subtracting
from

the

considering
the
great
endurance
of
these
trees
we
are
necessarily
led
to
inquire
into
the
means
by
which
they
are
enabled
to
arrive
at
such
strength
and
maturity
and
whether
it
may
be
considered
as
a
humiliation
we
will
not
determine
but
with
all
the
ingenious
mechanical
contrivances
of
man
we
are
still
unable
to
define
the
limits
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
plants
have
been
described
by
naturalists
who
would
determine
the
limits
of
the
two
kingdoms
as
organized
living
bodies
without
volition
or
locomotion
destitute
of
a
mouth
or
intestinal
cavity
which
when
detached
from
their
place
of
growth
die
and
in
decay
ferment
but
do
not
putrefy
and
which
on
being
subjected
to
analysis
furnish
an
excess
of
carbon
and
no
nitrogen
the
powers
of
chemistry
and
of
the
microscope
however
instead
of
confirming
these
views
tend
more
and
more
to
show
that
a
still
closer
affinity
exists
between
plants
and
animals
for
it
is
now
ascertained
that
nitrogen
which
was
believed
to
be
present
only
in
animals
enters
largely
into
the
composition
of
plants
also
when
the
microscope
is
brought
to
aid
our
powers
of
observation
we
find
that
there
are
organized
bodies
belonging
to
the
vegetable
kingdom
which
possess
very
evident
powers
of
locomotion
and
which
change
about
in
so
very
remarkable
a
manner
that
no
other
cause
than
that
of
volition
can
be
assigned
to
it
thus
it
would
seem
that
in
this
particular
at
least
some
vegetables
bear
a
very
close
resemblance
to
animal
life
and
when
we
consider
the
manner
in
which
they
are
supplied
with
nourishment
and
perform
the
functions
of
their
existence
the
resemblance
would
seem
still
closer
if
for
example
we
take
a
thin
transverse
slice
of
the
stem
of
any
plant
or
a
slice
cut
across
its
stem
and
immerse
it
in
a
little
pure
water
and
place
it
under
a
microscope
we
will
find
that
it
consists
principally
of
cells
more
or
less
regular
and
resembling
those
of
a
honeycomb
or
a
network
of
cobweb
the
size
of
these
varies
in
different
plants
as
it
does
in
different
parts
of
the
same
plant
and
they
are
sometimes
so
minute
as
to
require
a
million
to
cover
a
square
inch
of
surface
this
singular
structure
besides
containing
water
and
air
is
the
repository
or
storehouse
of
various
secretions
through
it
the
sap
when
produced
is
diffused
sideways
through
the
plant
and
by
it
numerous
changes
are
effected
in
the
juices
which
fill
its
cells
the
forms
of
the
cells
are
various
they
are
also
subject
to
various
transformations
sometimes
a
number
of
cylindrical
cells
are
laid
end
to
end
and
by
the
absorption
of
the
transverse
partitions
form
a
continuous
tube
as
in
the
of
plants
or
in
muscular
and
nervous
fibre
and
when
cells
are
thus
woven
together
they
are
called
cellular
tissue
which
in
the
human
body
forms
a
fine
membrane
enveloping
or
connecting
most
of
its
structures
in
pulpy
fruits
the
cells
may
be
easily
separated
one
from
the
other
and
within
the
cells
are
smaller
cells
commonly
known
as
pulp
among
the
of
some
plants
are
beautiful
crystals
called
the
term
is
derived
from
greek
rhaphis
a
on
account
of
the
resemblance
of
the
crystal
to
a
needle
they
are
composed
of
the
phosphate
and
oxalate
of
lime
but
there
is
great
difference
of
opinion
as
to
their
use
in
the
economy
of
the
plant
and
one
of
the
french
philosophers
endeavoured
to
prove
that
crystals
are
the
possible
transition
of
the
inorganic
to
organic
matter
the
differences
however
between
the
highest
form
of
crystal
and
the
lowest
form
of
organic
life
known
a
simple
reproductive
cell
are
so
manifold
and
striking
that
the
attempt
to
make
crystals
the
bridge
over
which
inorganic
matter
passes
into
organic
is
almost
totally
regarded
as
futile

which
consists

another
set
of
small

if
for
example
we
early
in

cut

will
perceive
the

out
from
numerous
points
over
the

on

part
occupied
by
the

if
a

on
which
the

already
unfolded
be
cut
from
the
tree
and
placed
with
its
cut
end
in

solution

matter
will
be
found
to
ascend
into
the
leaves
and
to
the
top
of
the
twig
in
both
these
cases
a
close
examination
with
a
powerful
microscope
will
discover
the
sap
perspiring
from
the
divided
portion
of
the
stem
and
the
colouring
matter
rising
through
real
tubes
to
the
top
of
the
twig
these
are
the
sap
or
conducting
vessels
of
the
plant
if
however
we
examine
a
transverse
section
of
the
vine
or
of
any
other
tree
at
a
later
period
of
the
season
we
find
that
the
wood
is
apparently
dry
whilst
the
bark
particularly
that
part
next
the
wood
is
swelled
with
fluid
this
is
contained
in
vessels
of
a
different
kind
from
those
in
which
the
sap
rises

are

only

may
be
called
returning
vessels
from
their
carrying
the
sap
downwards
after
its
preparation
in
the
leaf
it
is
believed
that
the
passage
of
the
sap
in
plants
is
conducted
in
a
manner
precisely
similar
to
that
of
the
blood
in
man
from
the
regular
contraction
and
expansion
of
the
vessels
but
on
account
of
their
extreme
minuteness
it
is
almost
an
impossibility
to
be
certain
upon
this
point
numerous
observations
made

that
their

seldom
exceeds

at

the
great
analogy
which
it
bears
to
the
veins

in
the
human
system
but
neither
it
nor
the
cellular
tissue
combined
is
all
that
is
required
to
perfect
the
production
of
a
vegetable
there
is
besides
a
tracheal

is
composed
of
very
minute
elastic
spiral
tubes
designed
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
air
both
to
and

there
are
also
fibres
which
consist
of
collections
of
these
cells
and
vessels
closely
united
together
these
form
the
root
and
the
stem
if
we
attempt
to
cut
them
transversely
we
meet
with
difficulty
because
we
have
to
force
our
way
across
the
tubes
and
break
them
but
if
we
slit
the
wood

the

separated
by
a
coat
of
cellular
tissue
without
which
they

besides
all
these
there
is
the
cuticle
which
extends
over
every
part
of
the

covers
the

with
three
distinct

the

to
be
formed

convey
the

the

now
demand
a
slight
notice
the
former
is
designed
not
only
to
support
the
plant
by
fixing
it
in
the
soil
but
also
to
fulfil
the
functions
of
a
channel
for
the
conveyance
of
nourishment
it
is
therefore
furnished
with
pores

they
are
called

their
resemblance
to
a

its

these

a

plant
known
by

this
is
the

form
of

by
being
subjected

it
has
a

a
variety
of
this
in

for

years
it
is
generally
supposed
that
the
water
in
which
potatoes
are
boiled
is
injurious
and
as
instances
are
recorded
where
cattle
having
drunk
it
were
seriously
affected
it
may
be
well
to
err
on
the
safe
side
and
avoid
its
use
for
any
alimentary
purpose
potatoes
which
have
been
exposed
to
the

and

green
are
very
unwholesome
cadet
de

that

clean

the
manner
in
which
this
is
made
is
very
simple
the
adhesive
tendency
of
the
flour
of
the
potato
acts
against
its
being
baked
or
kneaded
without
being
mixed
with
wheaten
flour
or
meal
it
may
however
be
made
into
cakes
in
the
following
manner
a
small
wooden
frame
nearly
square
is
laid
on
a
pan
like
a
and
is
grooved
and
so
constructed
that
by
means
of
a
presser
or
lid
introduced
into
the
groove
the
cake
is
at
once
fashioned
according
to
the
dimensions
of
the
mould
the
frame
containing
the
farina
may
be
almost
immediately
withdrawn
after
the
mould
is
formed
upon
the
pan
because
from
the
consistency
imparted
to
the
incipient
cake
by
the
heat
it
will
speedily
admit
of
being
safely
handled
it
must
not
however
be
fried
too
hastily
it
will
then
eat
very
palatably
and
might
from
time
to

be
soaked
for
puddings
like

can

it
is
said
to
have
been
originally
introduced
from
hanover
and
forms
an
excellent

vegetable

used

where
it
is
either

the

energy

of

the

needs
nourishment
physical
exercise
gives
an
appetite
which
it

necessary
to
satisfy
and
vegetables
can
not
resist
the
vigorous
action
of
the
gastric
organs
as
old
proverb
says
at
twenty
one
can
digest
iron
but
for
aged
persons
the
sedentary
or
the
delicate
it
is
quite
otherwise
then
the
gastric
power
has
considerably
diminished
the
digestive
organs
have
lost
their
energy
the
process
of
digestion
is
consequently
slower
and
the
least
excess
at
table
is
followed
by
derangement
of
the
stomach
for
several
days
those
who
generally
digest
vegetables
with
difficulty
should
eat
them
reduced
to
a
pulp

that
is
to
say
with
their
skins
and
tough
fibres
removed
subjected
to
this
process
vegetables
which
when
entire
would
create
flatulence
and
wind
are
then
comparatively
harmless
experience
has
established
the
rule
that
nourishment
is
not
complete
without
the
alliance
of
meat
with
vegetables
we
would
also
add
that
the
regime
most
favourable
to
health
is
found
in
variety
variety
pleases

monotony
is
disagreeable
the

is
fatigued

the

the

general
observations
on
puddings
and
pastry
puddings
and
pastry
familiar
as
they
may
be
and
unimportant
as
they
may
be
held
in
the
estimation
of
some
are
yet
intimately
connected
with
the
development
of
agricultural
resources
in
reference
to
the
cereal
grasses
when
they
began
to
be
made
is
uncertain
but
we
may
safely
presume
that
a
simple
form
of
pudding
was
amongst
the
first
dishes
made
after
discovering
a
mode
of
grinding
wheat
into
flour
traditional
history
enables
us
to
trace
man
back
to
the
time
of
the
deluge
after
that
event
he
seems
to
have
recovered
himself
in
the
central
parts
of
asia
and
to
have
first
risen
to
eminence
in
the
arts
of
civilization
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
from
this
region
greece
carthage
and
some
other
parts
along
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
sea
were
colonized
in
process
of
time
greece
gave
to
the
romans
the
arts
which
she
had
thus
received
from
egypt
and
these
subsequently
diffused
them
over
europe
how
these
were
carried
to
or
developed
in
india
and
china
is
not
so
well
ascertained
and
in
america
their
ancient
existence
rests
only
on
very
indistinct
traditions
as
to
who
was
the
real
discoverer
of
the
use
of
corn
we
have
no
authentic
knowledge
the
traditions
of
different
countries
ascribe
it
to
various
fabulous
personages
whose
names
it
is
here
unnecessary
to
introduce
in
egypt
however
corn
must
have
grown
abundantly
for
abraham
and
after
him
jacob
had
recourse
to
that
country
for
supplies
during
times
of
famine
the
habits
of
a
people
to
a
great
extent
are
formed
by
the
climate
in
which
they
live
and
by
the
native
or
cultivated
productions
in
which
their
country
abounds
thus
we
find
that
the
agricultural
produce
of
the
ancient
egyptians
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
that
of
the
present
day
and
the
habits
of
the
people
are
not
materially
altered
in
greece
the
products
cultivated
in
antiquity
were
the
same
kinds
of
grains
and
legumes
as
are
cultivated
at
present
with
the
vine
the
fig
the
olive
the
apple
and
other
fruits
so
with
the
romans
and
so
with
other
nations
as
to
the
different
modes
of
artificially
preparing
those
to
please
the
taste
it
is
only
necessary
to
say
that
they
arise
from
the
universal
desire
of
novelty
characteristic
of
man
in
the
development
of
his
social
conditions
thus
has
arisen
the
whole
science
of
cookery
and
thus
arose
the
art
of
making
puddings
the
porridge
of
the
scotch
is
nothing
more
than
a
species
of
hasty
pudding
composed
of
oatmeal
salt
and
water
and
the
red

for
which
esau
sold
his
birthright
must
have
been
something
similar
the
of
the
lacedaemonians
of
the
athenian
gladiators
and
common
people
was
the
same
with
the
exception
of
the
slight
seasoning
it
had
beyond
the
simplicity
of
scottish

a

two
ounces

and
the
quantity

this

a
little
millet

added
in
order
to
give
the
paste
greater

oatmeal
amongst
the
greeks
and
romans
was
highly
esteemed
as
was
also
rice
which
they
considered
as
beneficial
to
the
chest
they
also
held
in
high
repute
the
irion
or
indian
wheat
of
the
moderns
the
flour
of
this
cereal
was
made
into
a
kind
of
hasty
pudding
and
parched
or
roasted
as
eaten
with
a
little
salt
the
spelt
or
red
wheat
was
likewise
esteemed
and
its
flour
formed
the
basis
of
the
carthaginian
pudding
for
which
we
here
give
the
scientific
recipe
put
a
pound
of
flour
into
water
and
when
it
has
steeped
some
time
transfer
it
to
a
wooden
bowl
add
three
pounds
of
cream
cheese
half
a
pound
of
honey
and
one
egg
beat
the
whole
together
and
cook
it
on
a
slow
fire
in
a
stewpan
should
this
be
considered
unpalatable
another
form
has
been
recommended
sift
the
flour
and
with
some
water
put
it
into
a
wooden
vessel
and
for
ten
days
renew
the
water
twice
each
day
at
the
end
of
that
period
press
out
the
water
and
place
the
paste
in
another
vessel
it
is
now
to
be
reduced
to
the
consistence
of
thick
lees
and
passed
through
a
piece
of

linen
repeat
this
last
operation
then
dry
the
mass
in
the
sun
and
boil
it
in
milk
season
according
to
taste
these
are
specimens
of
the
puddings
of
antiquity
and
this
last
recipe
was
held
in
especial
favour
by
the
romans
however
great
may
have
been
the
qualifications
of
the
ancients
however
in
the
art
of
we
apprehend
that
such
preparations
as
gave
gratification
to
their
palates
would
have
generally
found
little
favour
amongst
the
insulated
inhabitants
of
great
britain
here
from
the
simple
suet
dumpling
up
to
the
most
complicated
christmas
production
the
grand
feature
of

is
primarily
attended
to
variety
in
the
ingredients
we
think
is
held
only
of
secondary
consideration
with
the
great
body
of
the
people
provided
that
the
whole
is
agreeable
and
of
sufficient
abundance
although
from
puddings
to
pastry
is
but
a
step
it
requires
a
higher
degree
of
art
to
make
the
one
than
to
make
the
other
indeed
pastry
is
one
of
the
most
important
branches
of
the
culinary
science
it
unceasingly
occupies
itself

the

at
a
very
early
period
the
orientals
were
acquainted
with
the
art
of
manipulating
in
pastry
but
they
by
no
means
attained
to
the
taste
variety
and
splendour
of
design
by
which
it
is
characterized
amongst
the
moderns
at
first
it
generally
consisted
of
certain
mixtures
of
flour
oil
and
honey
to
which
it
was
confined
for
centuries
even
among
the
southern
nations
of
the
european
continent

the
commencement
of
the
middle
ages
a
change
began
to
take
place
in
the
art

it
eggs
butter

salt
came
into
repute
in
the
making
of
paste
which
was
forthwith
used
as
an
inclosure

a
few
general
remarks
respecting
the

and

are
composed
may
be
acceptable
as

may
be
ascertained
by

the
bladder
through

to
try
this
method
per

about
the
second
century
of
the
christian
era
butter
was
placed
by
galen
amongst
the
useful
medical
agents
and
about
a
century
before
him
dioscorides
mentioned
that
he
had
noticed
that
fresh
butter
made
of
ewes
and
goats
milk
was
served
at
meals
instead
of
oil
and
that
it
took
the
place
of
fat
in
making
pastry
thus
we
have
undoubted
authority
that
eighteen
hundred
years
ago
there
existed
a
knowledge
of
the
useful
qualities
of
butter
the
romans
seem
to
have
set
about
making
it
much
as
we
do
for
pliny
tells
us
butter
is
made
from
milk
and
the
use
of
this
element
so
much
sought
after
by
barbarous
nations
distinguished
the
rich
from
the
common
people
it
is
obtained
principally
from
cows
milk
that
from

is
the
fattest

is
produced
by
agitating
the

allow

this

be
made
by

only
using

and
substituting
lard
for
a
portion
of
it
mix
the

the

the

but
until

we

no

any

beetroot
has
a

purgative
quality

leaves

the
large

are
serviceable
in
various
culinary
preparations
the
root
also
may
be
prepared
in
several
ways
but
its
most
general
use
is
in
salad
some
writers
upon
the
subject
have
expressed
their
opinion
that
beetroot
is
easily
digested
but
those
who
have
taken
pains
to
carefully
analyze
its
qualities
make
quite
a
contrary
statement
youth
of
course
can
digest
it
but
to
persons
of
a
certain
age
beet
is
very
indigestible
or
rather
it
does
not
digest
at
all
it
is
not
the
sugary
pulp
which
is
indigestible
but
its
fibrous
network
that
resists
the
action
of
the
gastric
organs
thus
when
the
root
is
reduced
to
a
puree
almost
any
person
may
eat
it
french
it
had
long
been
thought
that
tropical
heat
was
not
necessary
to
form
sugar
and
about
it
was
discovered
that
many
plants
of
the
temperate
zone
and
amongst
others
the
beet
contained
it
towards
the
beginning
of
the
century
circumstances
having
in
france
made
sugar
scarce
and
consequently
dear
the
government
caused
inquiries
to
be
instituted
as
to
the
possibility
of
finding
a
substitute
for
it
accordingly
it
was
ascertained
that
sugar
exists
in
the
whole
vegetable
kingdom
that
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
grape
chestnut
potato
but
that
far
above
all
the
beet
contains
it
in
a
large
proportion
thus
the
beet
became
an
object
of
the
most
careful
culture
and
many
experiments
went
to
prove
that
in
this
respect
the
old
world
was
independent
of
the
new

manufactories
came
into
existence
in
all

the

the

honoured
the

the

erected

executed

were
remarkable
for

the

a

a

woody
fibre

water
together
with
some
aroma
on
which
their
peculiar
flavour
depends
the
hard
acid
kinds
are
unwholesome
if
eaten
raw
but
by
the
process
of
cooking
a
great
deal
of
this
acid
is
decomposed
and
converted
into
sugar
the
sweet
and
mellow
kinds
form
a
valuable
addition
to
the
dessert
a
great
part
of
the
acid
juice
is
converted
into
sugar
as
the
fruit
ripens
and
even
after
it
is
gathered
by
natural
process
termed
maturation
but
when
apples
decay
the
sugar
is
changed
into
a
bitter
principle
and
the
mucilage
becomes
mouldy
and
offensive
old
cheese
has
a
remarkable
effect
in
meliorating

quince
the

corinth
originally
produced
the
most
beautiful
quinces
but
the
plant
was
subsequently
introduced
into
gaul
with
the
most
perfect
success
the
ancients
preserved
the
fruit
by
placing
it
with
its
branches
and
leaves
in
a
vessel
filled
with
honey
or
sweet
wine
which
was
reduced
to
half
the
quantity
by

quinces
may
be
profitably
cultivated
in
this
country
as
a
variety
with
other
and
may
be
planted
in
espaliers

as
standards
a
very
marmalade
may
be
prepared
from
quinces
and
a

portion
of

in

pie
much
improves
its
flavour
the
french
use
quinces
for
flavouring
many
sauces
this
fruit
has
the
remarkable
peculiarity
of
exhaling
an
agreeable
odour
taken
singly

when
in
any
quantity
or
when
they
are
stowed
away
in

drawer
or

room
the
pleasant
aroma
becomes
an
intolerable
stench
although
the
fruit
may
be
perfectly
sound
it
is
therefore
desirable
that
as

a

quinces
are

gooseberry
the
red
and
the
white
are
the
two
principal
varieties
of
gooseberries
the
red
are
rather
the
more
acid
but
when
covered
with
white
sugar
are
most
wholesome
because
the
sugar
neutralizes
their
acidity
red
gooseberries
make
an

is

they

raisins
are
grapes
prepared
by
suffering
them
to
remain
on
the
vine
until
they
are
perfectly
ripe
and
then
drying
them
in
the
sun
or
by
the
heat
of
an
oven
the
grapes
are
sweet
the
of
an
acid
flavour
the
common
way
of
drying
grapes
for
raisins
is
to
tie
two
or
three
bunches
of
them
together
whilst
yet
on
the
vine
and
dip
them
into
a
hot
lixivium
of
mixed
with
a
little
of
the
oil
of
olives
this
disposes
them
to
shrink
and
wrinkle
after
which
they
are
left
on
the
vine
three
or
four
days
separated
on
sticks
in
a
horizontal
situation
and
then
dried
in
the
sun
at
leisure
after
being

the
word
is
of
german
origin

in
its
german
form
signifies
burnt
wine

wine
that
has
undergone
the

of
fire
brandies
so
called
however

made
from

brandy
is
prepared
in
most
wine
countries
but
that
of
france
is
the
most
esteemed
it

procured
not

by

wine
itself

also
by
fermenting

residue
of
the
pressings

brandy
of
cognac

town
in
the
department
of
charente
and
that
brought
from

seem
to
owe
their
excellence
from
being
made
from
white
wine
like

brandy
is
colourless
when
recently
distilled
by
mere
keeping
however
owing
probably
to
some
change
in
the
soluble
matter
contained
in
it
it
acquires
a
slight
colour
which
is
much
increased
by
keeping
in
casks
and
is
made
of
the
required
intensity
by
the
addition
of

sugar

other
colouring

it
is
now
cultivated
in

the
name

very
useful
to

the
strawberry
belongs
to

and

cold
climates
and
no
fruit
of

latitudes
that
ripens
without

heat

at

comparable

yeast
consists
principally
of
a
substance
very
similar
in
composition
and
in
many
of
its
sensible
properties
to
gluten
and
when
new

it
is
inflated

frothy

a

acid

is
which

a
considerable
proportion
of
alcohol
or
spirit
the
quantity
of
yeast
employed
in
brewing
ale
being
small
the
saccharine
matter
is
but
imperfectly
decomposed
hence
a
considerable
portion
of
it
remains
in
the
liquor
and
gives
it
that
viscid
quality
and
body
for
which
it
is
remarkable
the
fermenting
property
of
yeast
is
weakened
by
boiling
for
ten
minutes
and
is
entirely
destroyed
by
continuing
the
boiling
alcohol
poured
upon
it
likewise
renders
it
inert
on
which
account
its
power
lessens
as

when
removed
by

is
employed
in
a
variety
of
culinary
preparations
the
analyses
of
the
contents
of
cream
have
been
decided
to
be
in
parts
butter
curd
or
matter
of
cheese
whey
that
cream
contains
an
oil
is
evinced
by
its
staining
clothes
in
the
manner
of
oil
and
when
boiled
for
some
time
a
little
oil
floats
upon

it

separated

as
in
the

of

the
cheesy

remains
blended
with
the
whey
in
the
state
of
of
the
several
kinds
of
cream
the
principal
are
the
devonshire
and
dutch
clotted
creams
the
costorphin
cream
and
the
scotch
sour
cream
the
devonshire
cream
is
produced
by
nearly
boiling
the
milk
in
shallow
tin
vessels
over
a
charcoal
fire
and
kept
in
that
state
until
the
whole
of
the
cream
is
thrown
up
it
is
used
for
eating
with
fruits
and
tarts
the
cream
from
costorphin
a
village
of
that
name
near
edinburgh
is
accelerated
in
its
separation
from
three
or
four
days
old
milk
by
a
certain
degree
of
heat
and
the
dutch
clotted
cream
a
coagulated
mass
in
which
a
spoon

stand

is
manufactured
from
milk
which
is
put
into
a
pan
and
stirred
with
a
spoon
two
or
three
times
a
day
to
prevent
the
cream
from
separating
from
the

the
scotch
sour
cream
is
a
misnomer
for
it
is
a
material
produced
without
cream
a
small
tub
filled
with
skimmed
milk
is
put
into
a
larger
one
containing
hot
water
and
after
remaining
there
all
night
the
thin
milk
called
is
drawn
off
and
the
remainder
of
the
contents
of
the
smaller
vessel
is
sour
cream
jellies
are
not
the
nourishing
food
they
were
at
one
time
considered
to
be
and
many
eminent
physicians
are
of
opinion
that
they
are
less
digestible
than
the
flesh
or
muscular
part
of
animals
still
when
acidulated
with
and
flavoured
with
wine
they
are
very
suitable
for
some
convalescents
vegetable
jelly
is
a
distinct
principle
existing
in
fruits
which
possesses
the
property
of
gelatinizing
when
boiled
and
cooled
but
it
is
a
principle
entirely
different
from
the
gelatine
of
animal
bodies
although
the
name
of
jelly
common
to
both
sometimes
leads
to
an
erroneous
idea
on
that
subject
animal
jelly
or
gelatine
is
glue
whereas
vegetable
jelly
is
rather
analogous
to
gum
liebig
places
gelatine
very
low
indeed
in
the
scale
of
usefulness
he
says
gelatine
which
by
itself
is
tasteless
and
when
eaten
excites
nausea
possesses
no
nutritive
value
that
even
when
accompanied
by
the
savoury
constituents
of
flesh
it
is
not
capable
of
supporting
the
vital
process
and
when
added
to
the
usual
diet
as
a
substitute
for
plastic
matter
does
not
increase
but
on
the
contrary
diminishes
the
nutritive
value
of
the
food
which
it
renders
insufficient
in
quantity
and
inferior
in
quality
it
is
this
substance
which
is
most
frequently
employed
in
the
manufacture
of
the
jellies
supplied
by
the
confectioner
but
those
prepared
at
home
from
feet
do
possess
some
nutrition
and
are
the
only
sort
that
should
be
given
to
invalids
isinglass
is
the
purest
variety
of
gelatine
and
is
prepared
from
the
sounds
or
of
certain
fish
chiefly
the
sturgeon
from
its
whiteness
it
is
mostly
used
for
making
and
similar
dishes
the
white
of
eggs
is
perhaps
the
best
substance
that
can
be
employed
in
clarifying
jelly
as
well
as
some
other
fluids
for
the
reason
that
when
albumen
and
the
white
of
eggs
is
nearly
pure
albumen
is
put
into
a
liquid
that
is
muddy
from
substances
suspended
in
it
on
boiling
the
liquid
the
albumen
coagulates
in
a
flocculent
manner
and
entangling
with
it
the
impurities
rises
with
them
to
the
surface
as
a
scum
or
sinks

an

they

the

be

careful
that

to

do
not
make
it
in

large
a

the

would
then
spread
too
much

taste
of
the

it
should
also
not
be
greasy
burnt

too
much
done

should
be
cooked

gentle
fire

the
whole

omelets
are
sometimes
served
with
gravy
but
should
never
be
poured
over
but
served
in
a

the
liquid
causes
the
omelet
to
become
heavy

flat
instead
of

peach
the

most
delicious
of
our
fruits

are
considered
as
varieties
of

species
produced
by
cultivation
the
former
is
characterized
by
a
very
delicate
down

the

them
to
perfection
hence
they
seldom
ripen
in
this
country
in

seasons

the

every
one
knows
says
brillat
savarin
in
his
physiology
of
taste
that
for
twenty
years
madame
récamier
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
paris
it
is
also
well
known
that
she
was
exceedingly
charitable
and
took
a
great
interest
in
every
benevolent
work
wishing
to
consult
the
curé
of
respecting
the
working
of
an
institution
she
went
to
his
house
at
five
in
the
afternoon
and
was
much
astonished
at
finding
him
already
at
his
madame
récamier
wished
to
retire
but
the
curé
would
not
hear
of
it
a
neat
white
cloth
covered
the
table
some
good
old
wine
sparkled
in
a
crystal
decanter
the
porcelain
was
of
the
best
the
plates
had
heaters
of
boiling
water
beneath
them
a

in
attendance
the
repast
was
a
compromise
between
frugality
and
luxury
the
had
just
been
removed
and
there
was
on
the
table
a
an
omelet
and
a
salad
dinner
will
tell
you
said
the
worthy
curé
with
a
smile
it
is
according
to
our
church
regulations
madame
récamier
and
her
host
attacked
the
trout
the
sauce
served
with
which
betrayed
a
skilful
hand
the
countenance
of
the
curé
the
while
showing
satisfaction
and
now
they
fell
upon
the
omelet
which
was
round
sufficiently
thick
and
cooked
so
to
speak
to
a
as
the
spoon
entered
the
omelet
a
thick
rich
juice
issued
from
it
pleasant
to
the
eye
as
well
as
to
the
smell
the
dish
became
full
of
it
and
our
fair
friend
owns
that
between
the
perfume
and
the
sight
it
made
her
mouth
water
is
an
au
that
is
to
say
a
tunny
omelet
said
the
curé
noticing
with
the
greatest
delight
the
emotion
of
madame
récamier
few
people
taste
it
without
lavishing
praises
on
it
surprises
me
not
at
all
returned
the
beauty
has
so
enticing
an
omelet
met
my
gaze
at
any
of
our
lay
tables
cook
understands
them
well
i
think
added
madame
never
ate
anything
so
delightful
then
came
the
salad
which
savarin
recommends
to
all
who
place
confidence
in
him
it
refreshes
without
exciting
and
he
has
a
theory
that
it
makes
people
younger
amidst
pleasant
converse
the
dessert
arrived
it
consisted
of
three
apples
cheese
and
a
plate
of
preserves
and
then
upon
a
little
round
table
was
served
the
mocha
coffee
for
which
france
has
been
and
is
so
justly
famous
never
said
the
curé
spirits
i
always
offer
liqueurs
to
my
guests
but
reserve
the
use
of
them
myself
to
my
old
age
if
it
should
please
providence
to
grant
me
that
finally
the
charming
madame
récamier
took
her
leave
and
told
all
her
friends
of
the
delicious
omelet
which
she
had
seen
and
partaken
of
and
brillat
savarin
in
his
capacity
as
the
layard
of
the
concealed
treasures
of
gastronomia
has
succeeded
in
withdrawing
from
obscurity
the
details
of
the
preparation
of
which
so
much
had
been
said
and
which
he
imagines
to

it

work
wonders
the
roe
and
the
tunny
must
be
beaten
up
sauté
without
allowing
them
to
boil
to
prevent
their
hardening
which
would
prevent

general
observations
on
preserves
confectionary
ices
and
dessert
dishes
preserves
from
the
nature
of
vegetable
substances
and
chiefly
from
their
not
passing
so
rapidly
into
the
putrescent
state
as
animal
bodies
the
mode
of
preserving
them
is
somewhat
different
although
the
general
principles
are
the
same
all
the
means
of
preservation
are
put
in
practice
occasionally
for
fruits
and
the
various
parts
of
vegetables
according
to
the
nature
of
the
species
the
climate
the
uses
to
which
they
are
applied
some
are
dried
as
nuts
raisins
sweet
herbs
others
are
preserved
by
means
of
sugar
such
as
many
fruits
whose
delicate
juices
would
be
lost
by
drying
some
are
preserved
by
means
of
vinegar
and
chiefly
used
as
condiments
or
pickles
a
few
also
by
salting
as
french
beans
while
others
are
preserved
in
spirits
we
have
however
in
this
place
to
treat
of
the
best
methods
of
preserving
fruits
fruit
is
a
most
important
item
in
the
economy
of
health
the
epicurean
can
scarcely
be
said
to
have
any
luxuries
without
it
therefore
as
it
is
so
invaluable
when
we
can
not
have
it
fresh
we
must
have
it
preserved
it
has
long
been
a
desideratum
to
preserve
fruits
by
some
cheap
method
yet
by
such
as
would
keep
them
fit
for
the
various
culinary
purposes
as
making
tarts
and
other
similar
dishes
the
expense
of
preserving
them
with
sugar
is
a
serious
objection
for
except
the
sugar
is
used
in
considerable
quantities
the
success
is
very
uncertain
sugar
also
overpowers
and
destroys
the
taste
so
desirable
in
many
fruits
these
which
are
preserved
in
this
manner
are
chiefly
intended
for
the
dessert
fruits
intended
for
preservation
should
be
gathered
in
the
morning
in
dry
weather
with
the
morning
sun
upon
them
if
possible
they
will
then
have
their
fullest
flavour
and
keep
in
good
condition
longer
than
when
gathered
at
any
other
time
until
fruit
can
be
used
it
should
be
placed
in
the
dairy
an
or
a
refrigerator
in
an
icehouse
it
will
remain
fresh
and
plump
for
several
days
fruit
gathered
in
wet
or
foggy
weather
will
soon
be
mildewed
and
be
of
no
service
for
preserves
having
secured
the
first
and
most
important
contribution
to
the
manufacture
of
preserves
the
fruit
the
next
consideration
is
the
preparation
of
the
syrup
in
which
the
fruit
is
to
be
suspended
and
this
requires
much
care
in
the
confectioner
art
there
is
a
great
nicety
in
proportioning
the
degree
of
concentration
of
the
syrup
very
exactly
to
each
particular
case
and
they
know
this
by
signs
and
express
it
by
certain
technical
terms
but
to
distinguish
these
properly
requires
very
great
attention
and
considerable
experience
the
principal
thing
to
be
acquainted
with
is
the
fact
that
in
proportion
as
the
syrup
is
longer
boiled
its
water
will
become
evaporated
and
its
consistency
will
be
thicker
great
care
must
be
taken
in
the
management
of
the
fire
that
the
syrup
does
not
boil
over
and
that
the
boiling
is
not
carried
to
such
an
extent
as
to
burn
the
sugar
the
first
degree
of
consistency
is
called
which
is
subdivided
into
the
little
and
great
thread
if
you
dip
the
finger
into
the
syrup
and
apply
it
to
the
thumb
the
tenacity
of
the
syrup
will
on
separating
the
finger
and
thumb
afford
a
thread
which
shortly
breaks
this
is
the
little
thread
if
the
thread
from
the
greater
tenacity
and
consequently
greater
strength
of
the
syrup
admits
of
a
greater
extension
of
the
finger
and
thumb
it
is
called
the
great
thread
there
are
half
a
dozen
other
terms
and
experiments
for
testing
the
various
thickness
of
the
boiling
sugar
towards
the
consistency
called
but
that
degree
of
belongs
to
the
confectioner
a
solution
of
sugar
prepared
by
dissolving
two
parts
of
sugar
the
best
sugar
is
the
most
economical
for
preserves
in
one
of
water
and
boiling
this
a
little
affords
a
syrup
of
the
right
degree
of
strength
and
which
neither
ferments
nor
crystallizes
this
appears
to
be
the
degree
called
by
the
confectioners
and
is
proper
to
be
used
for
the
purposes
of
preserves
the
syrup
employed
should
sometimes
be
clarified
which
is
done
in
the
following
manner
dissolve
lbs
of
loaf
sugar
in
a
pint
of
water
add
to
this
solution
the
white
of
an
egg
and
beat
it
well
put
the
upon
the
fire
with
the
solution
stir
it
with
a
wooden
spatula
and
when
it
begins
to
swell
and
boil
up
throw
in
some
cold
water
or
a
little
oil
to
damp
the
boiling
for
as
it
rises
suddenly
if
it
should
boil
over
it
would
take
fire
being
of
a
very
inflammable
nature
let
it
boil
up
again
then
take
it
off
and
remove
carefully
the
scum
that
has
risen
boil
the
solution
again
throw
in
a
little
more
cold
water
remove
the
scum
and
so
on
for
three
or
four
times
successively
then
strain
it
it
is
considered
to
be
sufficiently
boiled
when
some
taken
up
in
a
spoon
pours
out
like
oil
although
sugar
passes
so
easily
into
the
state
of
fermentation
and
is
in
fact
the
only
substance
capable
of
undergoing
the
vinous
stage
of
that
process
yet
it
will
not
ferment
at
all
if
the
quantity
be
sufficient
to
constitute
a
very
strong
syrup
hence
syrups
are
used
to
preserve
fruits
and
other
vegetable
substances
from
the
changes
they
would
undergo
if
left
to
themselves
before
sugar
was
in
use
honey
was
employed
to
preserve
many
vegetable
productions
though
this
substance
has
now
given
way
to
the
juice
of
the
the
fruits
that
are
the
most
fit
for
preservation
in
syrup
are
apricots
peaches
nectarines
apples
greengages
plums
of
all
kinds
and
pears
as
an
example
take
some
apricots
not
too
ripe
make
a
small
slit
at
the
stem
end
and
push
out
the
stone
simmer
them
in
water
till
they
are
softened
and
about
half
done
and
afterwards
throw
them
into
cold
water
when
they
have
cooled
take
them
out
and
drain
them
put
the
apricots
into
the
with
sufficient
syrup
to
cover
them
let
them
boil
up
three
or
four
times
and
then
skim
them
remove
them
from
the
fire
pour
them
into
an
earthen
pan
and
let
them
cool
till
next
day
boil
them
up
three
days
successively
skimming
each
time
and
they
will
then
be
finished
and
in
a
state
fit
to
be
put
into
pots
for
use
after
each
bailing
it
is
proper
to
examine
into
the
state
of
the
syrup
when
cold
if
too
thin
it
will
bear
additional
boiling
if
too
thick
it
may
be
lowered
with
more
syrup
of
the
usual
standard
the
reason
why
the
fruit
is
emptied
out
of
the
into
an
earthen
pan
is
that
the
acid
of
the
fruit
acts
upon
the
copper
of
which
the
are
usually
made
from
this
example
the
process
of
preserving
fruits
by
syrup
will
be
easily
comprehended
the
first
object
is
to
soften
the
fruit
by
blanching
or
boiling
it
in
water
in
order
that
the
syrup
by
which
it
is
preserved
may
penetrate
through
its
substance
many
fruits
when
preserved
by
boiling
lose
much
of
their
peculiar
and
delicate
flavour
as
for
instance
and
this
inconvenience
may
in
some
instances
be
remedied
by
preserving
them
without
heat
cut
the
fruit
in
slices
about
one
fifth
of
an
inch
thick
strew
powdered
loaf
sugar
an
eighth
of
an
inch
thick
on
the
bottom
of
a
jar
and
put
the
slices
on
it
put
more
sugar
on
this
and
then
another
layer
of
the
slices
and
so
on
till
the
jar
is
full
place
the
jar
with
the
fruit
up
to
the
neck
in
boiling
water
and
keep
it
there
till
the
sugar
is
completely
dissolved
which
may
take
half
an
hour
removing
the
scum
as
it
rises
lastly
tie
a
wet
bladder
over
the
mouth
of
the
jar
or
cork
and
wax
it
any
of
the
fruits
that
have
been
preserved
in
syrup
may
be
converted
into
dry
preserves
by
first
draining
them
from
the
syrup
and
then
drying
them
in
a
stove
or
very
moderate
oven
adding
to
them
a
quantity
of
powdered
loaf
sugar
which
will
gradually
penetrate
the
fruit
while
the
fluid
parts
of
the
syrup
gently
evaporate
they
should
be
dried
in
the
stove
or
oven
on
a
sieve
and
turned
every
six
or
eight
hours
fresh
powdered
sugar
being
sifted
over
them
every
time
they
are
turned
afterwards
they
are
to
be
kept
in
a
dry
situation
in
drawers
or
boxes
currants
and
cherries
preserved
whole
in
this
manner
in
bunches
are
extremely
elegant
and
have
a
fine
flavour
in
this
way
it
is
also
that
orange
and
lemon
chips
are
preserved
marmalades
jams
and
fruit
pastes
are
of
the
same
nature
and
are
now
in
very
general
request
they
are
prepared
without
difficulty
by
attending
to
a
very
few
directions
they
are
somewhat
expensive
but
may
be
kept
without
spoiling
for
a
considerable
time
marmalades
and
jams
differ
little
from
each
other
they
are
preserves
of
a
consistency
made
by
boiling
the
pulp
of
fruits
and
sometimes
part
of
the
rinds
with
sugar
the
appellation
of
marmalade
is
applied
to
those
confitures
which
are
composed
of
the
firmer
fruits
as
pineapples
or
the
rinds
of
oranges
whereas
jams
are
made
of
the
more
juicy
berries
such
as
strawberries
raspberries
currants
mulberries
fruit
pastes
are
a
kind
of
marmalades
consisting
of
the
pulp
of
fruits
first
evaporated
to
a
proper
consistency
and
afterwards
boiled
with
sugar
the
mixture
is
then
poured
into
a
mould
or
spread
on
sheets
of
tin
and
subsequently
dried
in
the
oven
or
stove
till
it
has
acquired
the
state
of
a
paste
from
a
sheet
of
this
paste
strips
may
be
cut
and
formed
into
any
shape
that
may
be
desired
as
knots
rings
jams
require
the
same
care
and
attention
in
the
boiling
as
marmalade
the
slightest
degree
of
burning
communicates
a
disagreeable
empyreumatic
taste
and
if
they
are
not
boiled
sufficiently
they
will
not
keep
that
they
may
keep
it
is
necessary
not
to
be
sparing
of
sugar
in
all
the
operations
for
when
the
is
used
it
should
not
be
placed
on
the
fire
but
on
a
trivet
unless
the
jam
is
made
on
a
hot
plate
when
this
is
not
necessary
if
the
pan
is
placed
close
on
to
the
fire
the
preserve
is
very
liable
to
burn
and
the
colour
and
flavour
be
consequently
spoiled
fruit
jellies
are
compounds
of
the
juices
of
fruits
combined
with
sugar
concentrated
by
boiling
to
such
a
consistency
that
the
liquid
upon
cooling
assumes
the
form
of
a
tremulous
jelly
before
fruits
are
candied
they
must
first
be
boiled
in
syrup
after
which
they
are
taken
out
and
dried
on
a
stove
or
before
the
fire
the
syrup
is
then
to
be

dipped
in
it
and
again
laid

not
the

is
the
a
confiture
made
at
the
moment
of
need
and
with
much
less
sugar
than
would
be
ordinarily
put
to

they
are
most
wholesome
things
suitable
to
most
stomachs
which
can
not
accommodate
themselves
to
raw
fruit
or
a
large
portion
of
sugar
they
are
the
happy
medium
and
far
better
than
ordinary
stewed
fruit
confectionary
in
speaking
of
confectionary
it
should
be
remarked
that
all
the
various
preparations
above
named
come
strictly
speaking
under
that
head
for
the
various
fruits
flowers
herbs
roots
and
juices
which
when
boiled
with
sugar
were
formerly
employed
in
pharmacy
as
well
as
for
sweetmeats
were
called
from
the
latin
word
make
up
but
the
term
confectionary
embraces
a
very
large
class
indeed
of
sweet
food
many
kinds
of
which
should
not
be
attempted
in
the
ordinary
cuisine
the
thousand
and
one
ornamental
dishes
that
adorn
the
tables
of
the
wealthy
should
be
purchased
from
the
confectioner
they
can
not
profitably
be
made
at
home
apart
from
these
cakes
biscuits
and
tarts
the
class
of
sweetmeats
called
confections
may
be
thus
classified
liquid
confects
or
fruits
either
whole
or
in
pieces
preserved
by
being
immersed
in
a
fluid
transparent
syrup
as
the
liquid
confects
of
apricots
green
citrons
and
many
foreign
fruits
dry
confects
are
those
which
after
having
been
boiled
in
the
syrup
are
taken
out
and
put
to
dry
in
an
oven
as
citron
and
marmalade
jams
and
pastes
a
kind
of
soft
compounds
made
of
the
pulp
of
fruits
or
other
vegetable
substances
beat
up
with
sugar
or
honey
such
as
oranges
apricots
pears
jellies
are
the
juices
of
fruits
boiled
with
sugar
to
a
pretty
thick
consistency
so
as
upon
cooling
to
form
a
trembling
jelly
as
currant
gooseberry
apple

conserves

dessert
dishes
with
moderns
the
dessert
is
not
so
profuse
nor
does
it
hold
the
same
relationship
to
the
dinner
that
it
held
with
the
ancients
the
romans
more
especially
on
ivory
tables
they
would
spread
hundreds
of
different
kinds
of
raw
cooked
and
preserved
fruits
tarts
and
cakes
as
substitutes
for
the
more
substantial
comestibles
with
which
the
guests
were
satiated
however
as
late
as
the
reigns
of
our
two
last
georges
fabulous
sums
were
often
expended
upon
fanciful
desserts
the
dessert
certainly
repays
in
its
general
effect
the
expenditure
upon
it
of
much
pains
and
it
may
be
said
that
if
there
be
any
poetry
at
all
in
meals
or
the
process
of
feeding
there
is
poetry
in
the
dessert
the
materials
for
which
should
be
selected
with
taste
and
of
course
must
depend
in
a
great
measure
upon
the
season
pines
melons
grapes
peaches
nectarines
plums
strawberries
apples
pears
oranges
almonds
raisins
figs
walnuts
filberts
medlars
cherries
all
kinds
of
dried
fruits
and
choice
and
cakes
and
biscuits
make
up
the
dessert
together
with
the
most
costly
and
wines
the
shape
of
the
dishes
varies
at
different
periods
the
prevailing
fashion
at
present
being
oval
and
circular
dishes
on
stems
the
patterns
and
colours
are
also
subject
to
changes
of
fashion
some
persons
selecting
china
chaste
in
pattern
and
colour
others
glass
dishes
on
stems
with
gilt
edges
the
beauty
of
the
dessert
services
at
the
tables
of
the
wealthy
tends
to
enhance
the
splendour
of
the
plate
the
general
mode
of
putting
a
dessert
on
table
now
the
elegant
tazzas
are
fashionable
is
to
place
them
down
the
middle
of
the
table
a
tall
and
short
dish
alternately
the
fresh
fruits
being
arranged
on
the
tall
dishes
and
dried
fruits
on
small
round
or
oval
glass
plates
the
garnishing
needs
especial
attention
as
the
contrast
of
the
fruits
with
foliage
is
very
charming
the
garnish
for
dessert
is
the
its
crystallized
dewdrops
producing
a
marvellous
effect
in
the
height
of
summer
giving
a
most
inviting
sense
of
coolness
to
the
fruit
it
encircles
the
mallow
strawberry
and
vine
leaves
have
a
pleasing
effect
and
for
winter
desserts
the
bay
cuba
and
laurel
are
sometimes
used
in
town
the
expense
and
difficulty
of
obtaining
natural
foliage
is
great
but
paper
and
composite
leaves
are
to
be
purchased
at
an
almost
nominal
price
mixed
fruits
of
the
larger
sort
are
now
frequently
served
on
one
dish
this
mode
admits
of
the
display
of
much
taste
in
the
arrangement
of
the
fruit
for
instance
a
pine
in
the
centre
of
the
dish
surrounded
with
large
plums
of
various
sorts
and
colours
mixed
with
pears
apples
all
arranged
with
a
due
regard
to
colour
have
a
very
good
effect
again
apples
and
pears
look
well
mingled
with
plums
and
grapes
hanging
from
the
border
of
the
dish
in
a
sort
of
manner
with
a
large
bunch
of
the
same
fruit
lying
on
the
top
of
the
apples
a
dessert
would
not
now
be
considered
complete
without
candied
and
preserved
fruits
and
confections
the
candied
fruits
may
be
purchased
at
a
less
cost
than
they
can
be
manufactured
at
home
they
are
preserved
abroad
in
most
ornamental
and
elegant
forms
and

from
the

of

or
more
generally
with

enough
to

carefully

sometimes
the
case

on
too
rapidly
in
it
for
the
thorough
intermingling
of
its
contents
on
which
the
excellence
of
the

greatly
depends
the

is
generally
made
of

in

commenced
or
that
it
should
be
completely
finished
before
partaking
of

it
is
also
necessary
to
abstain
from
them

experience
caramel
sugar
which
makes
an
elegant
cover
for
sweetmeats
is
difficult
to
prepare
and
is
best
left
to
an
experienced
confectioner
we
give
the
recipe
for
those
of
our
readers
who
care
to
attempt
the
operation
to
boil
sugar
to
caramel
to
every
lb
of
lump
sugar
allow
gill
of
spring
water
boil
the
sugar
and
water
together
very
quickly
over
a
clear
fire
skimming
it
very
carefully
as
soon
as
it
boils
keep
it
boiling
until
the
sugar
snaps
when
a
little
of
it
is
dropped
in
a
pan
of
cold
water
if
it
remains
hard
the
sugar
has
attained
the
right
degree
then
squeeze
in
a
little
and
let
it
remain
an
instant
on
the
fire
set
the
pan
into
another
of
cold
water
and
the
caramel
is
then
ready
for
use
the
insides
of
moulds
are
often
ornamented
with
this
sugar
which
with
a
fork
should
be
spread
over
them
in
fine
threads
or
network
a
dish
of
light
pastry
tastefully
arranged
looks
very
prettily
with
this
sugar
spun
lightly
over
it
the
sugar
must
be
carefully
watched
and
taken
up
the
instant
it
is
done
unless
the
cook
is
very
experienced
and
thoroughly
understands
her
business
it
is
scarcely
worth
while
to
attempt
to
make
this
elaborate
ornament
as
it
may
be
purchased
quite
as
economically
at
a
confectioner
if
the
failures
in
the
preparation
are
taken
into
consideration

were

by

cultivated
them
with

probably
introduced
some
of

sorts
into

which
others
were
added
by

in

occurs
in
extensive
tracts
in

both

supposed

varieties
of
the

which
have
been
produced
partly
by
the
superiority

partly
by

originally
brought
out

they

found
their

to

from

supposed
that
within
a
few
miles
of
maidstone
in

there
are
more
filberts
grown
than

it

general
observations
on
milk
butter
cheese
and
eggs
milk
milk
is
obtained
only
from
the
class
of
animals
called
mammalia
and
is
intended
by
nature
for
the
nourishment
of
their
young
the
milk
of
each
animal
is
distinguished
by
some
peculiarities
but
as
that
of
the
cow
is
by
far
the
most
useful
to
us
in
this
part
of
the
world
our
observations
will
be
confined
to
that
variety
milk
when
drawn
from
the
cow
is
of
a
colour
and
is
the
most
yellow
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
of
lactation
its
taste
is
agreeable
and
rather
saccharine
the
viscidity
and
specific
gravity
of
milk
are
somewhat
greater
than
that
of
water
but
these
properties
vary
somewhat
in
the
milk
procured
from
different
individuals
on
an
average
the
specific
gravity
of
milk
is
water
being
the
small
cows
of
the
alderney
breed
afford
the
richest
milk
milk
which
is
carried
to
a
considerable
distance
so
as
to
be
much
agitated
and
cooled
before
it
is
put
into
pans
to
settle
for
cream
never
throws
up
so
much
nor
such
rich
cream
as
if
the
same
milk
had
been
put
into
pans
directly
after
it
was
milked
milk
considered
as
an
aliment
is
of
such
importance
in
domestic
economy
as
to
render
all
the
improvements
in
its
production
extremely
valuable
to
enlarge
upon
the
antiquity
of
its
use
is
unnecessary
it
has
always
been
a
favourite
food
in
britain
lacte
et
carno
vivunt
says
caesar
in
his
commentaries
the
english
of
which
is
the
inhabitants
subsist
upon
flesh
and
milk
the
breed
of
the
cow
has
received
great
improvement
in
modern
times
as
regards
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
milk
which
she
affords
the
form
of
their
mode
of
nourishment
and
progress
are
also
manifest
in
the
management
of
the
dairy
although
milk
in
its
natural
state
be
a
fluid
yet
considered
as
an
aliment
it
is
both
solid
and
fluid
for
no
sooner
does
it
enter
the
stomach
than
it
is
coagulated
by
the
gastric
juice
and
separated
into
curd
and
whey
the
first
of
these
being
extremely
nutritive
milk
of
the
is
much
thinner
than
cow
milk
comes
the
nearest
to
human
milk
of
any
other
is
something
thicker
and
richer
than
cow
milk
has
the
appearance
of
cow
milk
and
affords
a
larger
quantity
of
cream
contains
more
sugar
than
that
of
the
ewe
is
used
only
in
africa
is
employed
in
india
from
no
other
substance
solid
or
fluid
can
so
great
a
number
of
distinct
kinds
of
aliment
be
prepared
as
from
milk
some
forming
food
others
drink
some
of
them
delicious
and
deserving
the
name
of
luxuries
all
of
them
wholesome
and
some
medicinal
indeed
the
variety
of
aliments
that
seems
capable
of
being
produced
from
milk
appears
to
be
quite
endless
in
every
age
this
must
have
been
a
subject
for
experiment
and
every
nation
has
added
to
the
number
by
the
invention
of
some
peculiarity
of
its
own
butter
beckman
in
his
history
of
inventions
states
that
butter
was
not
used
either
by
the
greeks
or
romans
in
cooking
nor
was
it
brought
upon
their
tables
at
certain
meals
as
is
the
custom
at
present
in
england
it
has
been
made
from
time
immemorial
though
the
art
of
making
cheese
is
said
not
to
have
been
known
to
the
ancient
britons
and
to
have
been
learned
from
their
conquerors
the
taste
of
butter
is
peculiar
and
very
unlike
any
other
fatty
substance
it
is
extremely
agreeable
when
of
the
best
quality
but
its
flavour
depends
much
upon
the
food
given
to
the
cows
to
be
good
it
should
not
adhere
to
the
knife
butter
with
regard
to
its
dietetic
properties
may
be
regarded
nearly
in
the
light
of
vegetable
oils
and
animal
fats
but
it
becomes
sooner
rancid
than
most
other
fat
oils
when
fresh
it
can
not
but
be
considered
as
very
wholesome
but
it
should
be
quite
free
from
rancidity
if
slightly
salted
when
it
is
fresh
its
wholesomeness
is
probably
not
at
all
impaired
but
should
it
begin
to
turn
rancid
salting
will
not
correct
its
unwholesomeness
when
salt
butter
is
put
into
casks
the
upper
part
next
the
air
is
very
apt
to
become
rancid
and
this
rancidity
is
also
liable
to
affect
the
whole
cask
is
the
kind
most
esteemed
in
london
comes
to
london
from
buckinghamshire
suffolk
oxfordshire

similar
in

to
the

in
london

all
salted
but
is
generally
good
the
number
of
firkins
exported
annually
from
ireland
amounts
to
equal
to
a
million
of
money
is
in
good
repute
all
over
europe
america
and
even
india
and
no
country
in
the
world
is
so
successful
in
the
manufacture
of
this
article
holland
supplying
more
butter
to
the
rest
of
the
world
than
any
country
whatever
there
are
two
methods
pursued
in
the
manufacture
of
butter
in
one
the
cream
is
separated
from
the
milk
and
in
that
state
it
is
converted
into
butter
by
churning
as
is
the
practice
about
epping
in
the
other
milk
is
subjected
to
the
same
process
which
is
the
method
usually
followed
in
cheshire
the
first
method
is
generally
said
to
give
the
richest
butter
and
the
latter
the
largest
quantity
though
some
are
of
opinion
that
there
is
little
difference
either
in
quality
or
quantity
cheese
cheese
is
the
curd
formed
from
milk
by
artificial
coagulation
pressed
and
dried
for
use
curd
called
also
casein
and
caseous
matter
or
the
basis
of
cheese
exists
in
the
milk
and
not
in
the
cream
and
requires
only
to
be
separated
by
coagulation
the
coagulation
however
supposes
some
alteration
of
the
curd
by
means
of
the
substance
employed
to
coagulate
it
it
is
rendered
insoluble
in
water
when
the
curd
is
freed
from
the
whey
kneaded
and
pressed
to
expel
it
entirely
it
becomes
cheese
this
assumes
a
degree
of
transparency
and
possesses
many
of
the
properties
of
coagulated
albumen
if
it
be
well
dried
it
does
not
change
by
exposure
to
the
air
but
if
it
contain
moisture
it
soon
putrefies
it
therefore
requires
some
salt
to
preserve
it
and
this
acts
likewise
as
a
kind
of
seasoning
all
our
cheese
is
coloured
more
or
less
except
that
made
from
skim
milk
the
colouring
substances
employed
are
arnatto
turmeric
or
marigold
all
perfectly
harmless
unless
they
are
adulterated
and
it
is
said
that
arnatto
sometimes
contains
red
lead
cheese
varies
in
quality
and
richness
according
to
the
materials
of
which
it
is
composed
it
is
made
of
entire
milk
as
in
cheshire
of
milk
and
cream
as
at
stilton
of
new
milk
mixed
with
skimmed
milk
as
in
gloucestershire
of
skimmed
milk
only
as
in
suffolk
holland
and
italy
the
principal
varieties
of
cheese
used
in
england
are
the
following
famed
all
over
europe
for
its
rich
quality
and
fine
piquant
flavour
it
is
made
of
entire
new
milk
the
cream
not
being
taken
off
is
much
milder
in
its
taste
than
the
cheshire
there
are
two
kinds
of
gloucester
cheese
single
and
double
is
made
of
skimmed
milk
or
of
the
milk
deprived
of
half
the
cream
is
a
cheese
that
pleases
almost
every
palate
it
is
made
of
the
whole
milk
and
cream
is
made
by
adding
the
cream
of
one
day
to
the
entire
milk
of
the
next
it
was
first
made
at
stilton
in
leicestershire
is
so
called
from
the
practice
of
colouring
some
curd
with
bruised
sage
and
parsley
and
mixing
this
with
some
uncoloured
curd
with
the
romans
and
during
the
middle
ages
this
practice
was
extensively
adopted
much
resembles
parmesan
it
has
a
very
agreeable
taste
and
flavour
and
has
a
spongy
appearance
has
nothing
remarkable
except
its
form
it
is
made
by
turning
with
rennet
a
mixture
of
cream
and
new
milk
the
curd
is
put
into
a
wooden
vessel
the
shape
of
a
brick
and
is
then
pressed
and
dried
in
the
usual
way
has
a
peculiarly
mild
and
rich
taste
the
best
is
made
entirely
from
new
milk
as
it
is
called
in
london
is
made
chiefly
in
lincolnshire
and
is
either
made
of
all
cream
or
like
stilton
by
adding
the
cream
of
one
day
milking
to
the
milk
that
comes
immediately
from
the
cow
they
are
extremely
thin
and
are
compressed
gently
two
or
three
times
turned
for
a
few
days
and
then
eaten
new
with
radishes
salad
milk
is
made
for
sea
voyages
principally
is
made
in
parma
and
piacenza
it
is
the
most
celebrated
of
all
cheese
it
is
made
entirely
of
skimmed
cow
milk
the
high
flavour
which
it
has
is
supposed
to
be
owing
to
the
rich
herbage
of
the
meadows
of
the
po
where
the
cows
are
pastured
the
best
parmesan
is
kept
for
three
or
four
years
and
none
is
carried
to
market
till
it
is
at
least
six
months
old
derives
its
peculiar
pungent
taste
from
the
practice
adopted
in
holland
of
coagulating
the
milk
with
muriatic
acid
instead
of
rennet
in
their
several
varieties
are
all
remarkable
for
their
fine
flavour
that
from
a
bailiwick
in
the
canton
of
fribourg
is
best
known
in
england
it
is
flavoured
by
the
dried
herb
of

powder
cheese
from
milk
and
potatoes
is
manufactured
in
thuringia
and
saxony
although
so
called
is
not
properly
cheese
but
is
nothing
more
than
cream
dried
sufficiently
to
be
cut
with
a
knife
eggs
there
is
only
one
opinion
as
to
the
nutritive
properties
of
eggs
although
the
qualities
of
those
belonging
to
different
birds
vary
somewhat
those
of
the
common
hen
are
most
esteemed
as
delicate
food
particularly
when
the
quality
of
eggs
depends
much
upon
the
food
given
to
the
hen
eggs
in
general
are
considered
most
easily
digestible
when
little
subjected
to
the
art
of
cookery
the
lightest
way
of
dressing
them
is
by
poaching
which
is
effected
by
putting
them
for
a
minute
or
two
into
brisk
boiling
water
this
coagulates
the
external
white
without
doing
the
inner
part
too
much
eggs
are
much
better
when
than
a
day
or
two
afterwards
the
usual
time
allotted
for
boiling
eggs
in
the
shell
is
to
minutes
less
time
than
that
in
boiling
water
will
not
be
sufficient
to
solidify
the
white
and
more
will
make
the
yolk
hard
and
less
digestible
it
is
very
difficult
to
accurately
as
to
the
time
great
care
should
be
employed
in
putting
them
into
the
water
to
prevent
cracking
the
shell
which
inevitably
causes
a
portion
of
the
white
to
exude
and
lets
water
into
the
egg
eggs
are
often
beaten
up
raw
in
nutritive
beverages
eggs
are
employed
in
a
very
great
many
articles
of
cookery
entrées
and
entremets
and
they
form
an
essential
ingredient
in
pastry
creams
flip
it
is
particularly
necessary
that
they
should
be
quite
fresh
as
nothing
is
worse
than
stale
eggs
cobbett
justly
says
stale
or
even
preserved
eggs
are
things
to
be
run
from
not
after
the
metropolis
is
supplied
with
eggs
from
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
and
they
are
likewise
largely
imported
from
various
places
on
the
continent
as
france
holland
belgium
guernsey
and
jersey
it
appears
from
official
statements
mentioned
in
mcculloch
commercial
dictionary
that
the
number
imported
from
france
alone
amounts
to
about
a
year
and
supposing
them
on
an
average
to
cost
fourpence
a
dozen
it
follows
that
we
pay
our
continental
neighbours
above
a
year
for
eggs
the
eggs
of
different
birds
vary
much
in
size
and
colour
those
of
the
ostrich
are
the
largest
one
laid
in
the
menagerie
in
paris
weighed
lbs
held
a
pint
and
was
six
inches
deep
this
is
about
the
usual
size
of
those
brought
from
africa
travellers
describe
as
of
an
agreeable
taste
they
keep
longer
than
hen
eggs
are
often
made
of
the
shell
which
is
very
strong
the
eggs
of
the
are
almost
as
mild
as
those
of
the
hen
the
egg
of
the
is
large
but
have
a
rich
flavour
the
albumen
is
slightly
transparent
or
bluish
when
set
or
coagulated
by
boiling
which
requires
less
time
than
hen
eggs
are
smaller
and
more
delicate
than
those
of
the
hen

separation
of
milk
and
cream
if
it
be
desired
that
the
milk
should
be
freed
entirely
from
cream
it
should
be
poured
into
a
very
shallow
broad
pan
or
dish
not
more
than
inch
deep
as
cream
can
not
rise
through
a
great
depth
of
milk
in
cold
and
wet
weather
milk
is
not
so
rich
as
it
is
in
summer
and
warm
weather
and
the
morning
milk
is
always
richer
than
the
evening
the
milk
of
each
milking
at
all
times
and
seasons
is
richer
than
the
and
on
that
account
should
be
set
apart
for
cream
milk
should
be
shaken
as
little
as
possible
when
carried
from
the
cow
to
the
dairy
and
should
be
poured
into
the
pans
very
gently
persons
not
keeping
cows
may
always
have
a
little
cream
provided
the
milk
they
purchase
be
pure
and
unadulterated
as
soon
as
it
comes
in
it
should
be
poured
into
very
shallow
open
and
set
by
in
a
very
cool
place
and
in
or
hours
a
nice
cream
should
have
risen
to
the
surface
milk
is
one
of
the
most
complete
of
all
articles
of
food
that
is
to
say
it
contains
a
very
large
number
of
the
elements
which
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
human
body
it
disagrees
with
fat
heavy
languid
people
of
slow
circulation
and
at
first
with
many
people
of
sedentary
habits
and
stomachs
weakened
by
stimulants
of
different
kinds
but
if
exercise
can
be
taken
and
a
little
patience
shown
while
the
system
accommodates
itself
to
a
new
regimen
this
bland
and
soothing
article
of
diet
is
excellent
for
the
majority
of
thin
nervous
people
especially
for
those
who
have
suffered
much
from
emotional
disturbances
or
have
relaxed
their
stomachs
by
too
much
tea
or
coffee
taken
too
hot
milk
is
in
fact
a
nutrient
and
a
sedative
at
once
stomachs
however
have
their
idiosyncrasies
and
it
sometimes
proves
an
unwelcome
and
article
of
food
as
milk
when
good
contains
a
good
deal
of
respiratory
material
fat
material
which
either
be
burnt
off
or
derange
the
liver
and
be
rejected
in
other
ways
it
may
disagree
because
the
lungs
are
not
sufficiently
used
in
the
open
air
but
it
is
very
probable
that
there
are
really
constitutions
which
can
not
take
to
it
and
should
not
be
forced
to
keep
milk
and
cream
in
hot
weather
when
the
weather
is
very
warm
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
prevent
milk
from
turning
sour
and
spoiling
the
cream
it
should
be
scalded
and
it
will
then
remain
good
for
a
few
hours
it
must
on
no
account
be
allowed
to
boil
or
there
will
be
a
skin
instead
of
a
cream
upon
the
milk
and
the
slower
the
process
the
safer
will
it
be
a
very
good
plan
to
scald
milk
is
to
put
the
pan
that
contains
it
into
a
saucepan
or
wide
kettle
of
boiling
water
when
the
surface
looks
thick
the
milk
is
sufficiently
scalded
and
it
should
then
be
put
away
in
a
cool
place
in
the
same
vessel
that
it
was
scalded
in
cream
may
be
kept
for
hours
if
scalded
without
sugar
and
by
the
addition
of
the
latter
ingredient
it
will
remain
good
double
the
time
if
kept
in
a
cool
place
all
pans
jugs
and
vessels
intended
for
milk
should
be
kept
beautifully
clean
and
well
scalded
before
the
milk
is
put
in
as
any
negligence
in
this
respect
may
cause
large
quantities
of
it
to
be
spoiled
and
milk
should
never
be
kept
in
vessels
of
zinc
or
copper
milk
may
be
preserved
good
in
hot
weather
for
a
few
hours
by
placing
the
jug
which
contains
it
in

very
cold
water

a
pinch
of
bicarbonate
of
soda
may
be
introduced
into
the
liquid

of
an
opaque

colour
the

comes

broken
by

milk
is
in
fact
the
simplest
way
of
testing
its
quality
the
commonest
adulterations
of
milk
are
not
of
a
hurtful
character
it
is
a
good
deal
thinned
with
water
and
sometimes
thickened
with
a
little
starch
or
colored
with
yolk
of

or
even

have
nothing

a

in

causes
the

many
persons
keep

for

by
smearing
the

away
or
their
flavour
when
used
can
not
be
relied
on
another
simple
way
of
preserving
eggs
is
to
immerse
them
in
soon
after
they
have
been
laid
and
then
to
put
the

the
best
time
for
preserving
eggs
is
from

of

it
will
be
found
to
consist
of
two
parts
the
husk
or
exterior
covering
which
is
generally
of
a
dark
colour
and
the
inner
or
albuminous
part
which
is
more
or
less
white
in
grinding
these
two
portions
are
separated
and
the
husk
being
blown
away
in
the
process
of
winnowing
the
flour
remains
in
the
form
of
a
light
brown
powder

principally
of

it
undergoes

process
called

it

separate
the
coarser
parts
leaving
behind

the
fine
firsts
of
the
the
process

to
deprive

portion
containing
much
of
that
substance
while
the
lighter
part
is
peculiarly
rich

bran
contains
a
large
proportion
of
gluten
hence
it
will
be
seen
why
brown
broad
is
so
much
more
nutritious
than
white
in
fact
we
may
lay
it
down
as
a
general
rule
that
the
whiter
the
bread
the
less
nourishment
it
contains
majendie
proved
this
by
feeding
a
dog
for
forty
days
with
white
wheaten
bread
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
died
while
another
dog
fed
on
brown
bread
made
with
flour
mixed
with
bran
lived
without
any
disturbance
of
his
health
the
bolting
process
then
is
rather
injurious
than
beneficial
in
its
result
and
is
one
of
the
numerous
instances
where
fashion
has
chosen
a
wrong
standard
to
go
by
in
ancient
times
down
to
the
emperors
no
bolted
flour
was
known
in
many
parts
of
germany
the
entire

is
used
and
in
no

the
world
are
the
digestive
organs
of
the
people
in
a
better
condition
in
years
of
famine
when
corn
is
scarce
the
use
of
bolted
flour
is
most
culpable
for
from
to
per

is
lost

brown
bread
has
of
late
years
become
very
popular
and
many
physicians
have
recommended
it
to
invalids
with
weak
digestions
with
great
success
this
rage
for
white
bread
has
introduced
adulterations
of
a
very
serious
character
affecting
the
health
of
the
whole
community
potatoes
are
added
for
this
purpose
but
this

harmless
cheat

ancient
art

element

unleavened
every
family
used
to
prepare
the
bread
for
its
own
consumption
the
of
baking
not
having
yet
taken
shape
it
is
said
that
somewhere
about
the
beginning
of
the
thirtieth
olympiad
the
slave
of
an
archon
at
athens
made
leavened
bread
by
accident
he
had
left
some
wheaten
dough
in
an
earthen
pan
and
forgotten
it
some
days
afterwards
he
lighted
upon
it
again
and
found
it
turning
sour
his
first
thought
was
to
throw
it
away
but
his
master
coming
up
he
mixed
this
now
acescent
dough
with
some
fresh
dough
which
he
was
working
at
the
bread
thus
produced
by
the
introduction
of
dough
in
which
alcoholic
fermentation
had
begun
was
found
delicious
by
the
archon
and
his
friends
and
the
slave
being
summoned
and
catechised
told
the
secret
it
spread
all
over
athens
and
everybody
wanting
leavened
bread
at
once
certain
persons
set
up
as
or
bakers
in
a
short
time
became
quite
an
art
and
athenian
bread
was
quoted
all
over
greece
as
the
best
bread
just
as
the
honey
of
hyamettus
was
celebrated
as
the
best
honey
in
our
own
times
and
among
civilized
peoples
bread
has
become
an
article
of
food
of
the
first
necessity
and
properly
so
for
it
constitutes
of
itself
a
complete
the
gluten
starch
and
sugar
which
it
contains
representing
azotized
and
nutrients
and
combining
the
sustaining
powers
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
in
one
product
wheaten
the
finest
wholesomest
and
most
savoury
bread
is
made
from
wheaten
flour
there
are
of
wheat
three
leading
qualities
the
soft
the
medium
and
the
hard
wheat
the
last
of
which
yields
a
kind
of
bread
that
is
not
so
white
as
that
made
from
soft
wheat
but
is
richer
in
gluten
and
consequently
more
nutritive
rye
this
comes
next
to
wheaten
bread
it
is
not
so
rich
in
gluten
but
is
said
to
keep
fresh
longer
and
to
have
some
laxative
qualities
barley
bread
bread
bread
made
from
barley
maize
oats
rice
potatoes
rises
badly
because
the
grains
in
question
contain
but
little
gluten
which
makes
the
bread
heavy
close
in
texture
and
difficult
of
digestion
in
fact
has
to
be
added
before
panification
can
take
place
in
countries
where
wheat
is
scarce
and
maize
abundant
the
people
make
the
latter
a
chief
article
of
sustenance
when
prepared
in
different
forms
panification
or
consists
of
the
following
processes
in
the
case
of
wheaten
flour
fifty
or
sixty
per
cent
of
water
is
added
to
the
flour
with
the
addition
of
some
leavening
matter
and
preferably
of
yeast
from
malt
and
hops
all
kinds
of
leavening
matter
have
however
been
and
are
still
used
in
different
parts
of
the
world
in
the
east
indies
toddy
which
is
a
liquor
that
flows
from
the
wounded
tree
and
in
the
west
indies
dunder
or
the
refuse
of
the
distillation
of
rum
the
dough
then
undergoes
the
process
called
the
yeast
produces
fermentation
a
process
which
may
be
thus
described
the
dough
reacting
upon
the
leavening
matter
introduced
the
starch
of
the
flour
is
transformed
into
saccharine
matter
the
saccharine
matter
being
afterwards
changed
into
alcohol
and
carbonic
acid
the
dough
must
be
well
bound
and
yet
allow
the
escape
of
the
little
bubbles
of
carbonic
acid
which
accompany
the
fermentation
and
which
in
their
passage
cause
the
numerous
little
holes
which
are
seen
in
light
bread
the
yeast
must
be
good
and
fresh
if
the
bread
is
to
be
digestible
and
nice
stale
yeast
produces
instead
of
vinous
fermentation
an
acetous
fermentation
which
flavours
the
bread
and
makes
it
disagreeable
a
poor
thin
yeast
produces
an
imperfect
fermentation
the
result
being
a
heavy
unwholesome
loaf
when
the
dough
is
well
kneaded
it
is
left
to
stand
for
some
time
and
then
as
soon
as
it
begins
to
swell
it
is
divided
into
loaves
after
which
it
is
again
left
to
stand
when
it
once
more
swells
up
and
manifests
for
the
last
time
the
symptoms
of
fermentation
it
is
then
put
into
the
oven
where
the
water
contained
in
the
dough
is
partly
evaporated
and
the
loaves
swell
up
again
while
a
yellow
crust
begins
to
form
upon
the
surface
when
the
bread
is
sufficiently
baked
the
bottom
crust
is
hard
and
resonant
if
struck
with
the
finger
while
the
crumb
is
elastic
and
rises
again
after
being
pressed
down
with
the
finger
the
bread
is
in
all
probability
baked
sufficiently
if
on
opening
the
door
of
the
oven
you
are
met
by
a
cloud
of
steam
which
quickly
passes
away
one
word
as
to
the
unwholesomeness
of
new
bread
and
hot
rolls
when
bread
is
taken
out
of
the
oven
it
is
full
of
moisture
the
starch
is
held
together
in
masses
and
the
bread
instead
of
being
crusted
so
as
to
expose
each
grain
of
starch
to
the
saliva
actually
prevents
their
digestion
by
being
formed
by
the
teeth
into
leathery
poreless
masses
which
lie
on
the
stomach
like
so
many
bullets
bread
should
always
be
at
least
a
day
old
before
it
is
eaten
and
if
properly
made
and
kept
in
a
place
ought
to
be
perfectly
soft
and
palatable
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
days
hot
rolls
swimming
in
melted
butter
and
new
bread
ought
to
be
carefully
shunned
by
everybody
who
has
the
slightest
respect
for
that
individual
the
stomach
aerated
it
is
not
unknown
to
some
of
our
readers
that
dauglish
of
malvern
has
recently
patented
a
process
for
making
bread
light
without
the
use
of
leaven
the
ordinary
process
of
by
fermentation
is
tedious
and
much
labour
of
human
hands
is
requisite
in
the
kneading
in
order
that
the
dough
may
be
thoroughly
interpenetrated
with
the
leaven
the
new
process
impregnates
the
bread
by
the
application
of
machinery
with
carbonic
acid
gas
or
fixed
air
different
opinions
are
expressed
about
the
bread
but
it
is
curious
to
note
that
as
corn
is
now
reaped
by
machinery
and
dough
is
baked
by
machinery
the
whole
process
of
is
probably
in
course
of
undergoing
changes
which
will
emancipate
both
the
housewife
and
the
professional
baker
from
a
large
amount
of
labour
in
the
production
of
aërated
bread
wheaten
flour
water
salt
and
carbonic
acid
gas
generated
by
proper
machinery
are
the
only
materials
employed
we
need
not
inform
our
readers
that
carbonic
acid
gas
is
the
source
of
the
effervescence
whether
in
common
water
coming
from
a
depth
or
in
lemonade
or
any
aërated
drink
its
action
in
the
new
bread
takes
the
place
of
fermentation
in
the
old
in
the
patent
process
the
dough
is
mixed
in
a
great
iron
ball
inside
which
is
a
system
of
paddles
perpetually
turning
and
doing
the
kneading
part
of
the
business
into
this
globe
the
flour
is
dropped
till
it
is
full
and
then
the
common
atmospheric
air
is
pumped
out
and
the
pure
gas
turned
on
the
gas
is
followed
by
the
water
which
has
been
aërated
for
the
purpose
and
then
begins
the
churning
or
kneading
part
of
the
business
of
course
it
is
not
long
before
we
have
the
dough
and
very
light
and
nice
it
looks
this
is
caught
in
tins
and
passed
on
to
the
floor
of
the
oven
which
is
an
endless
floor
moving
slowly
through
the
fire
done
to
a
turn
the
loaves
emerge
at
the
other
end
of
the
apartment
and
the
aërated
bread
is
made
it
may
be
added
that
it
is
a
good
plan
to
change
one
baker
from
time
to
time
and
so
secure
a
change
in
the
quality
of
the
bread
that
is
eaten
mixed
rye
bread
is
hard
of
digestion
and
requires
longer
and
slower
baking
than
wheaten
bread
it
is
better
when
made
with
leaven
of
wheaten
flour
rather
than
yeast
and
turns
out
lighter
it
should
not
be
eaten
till
two
days
old
it
will
keep
a
long
time
a
good
bread
may
be
made
by
mixing
and
in
equal
proportions
also
by
mixing
rye
wheat
and
barley
in
norway
it
is
said
that
they
only
bake
their
barley
broad
once
a
year
such
is
its
keeping
quality
flour
mixed
with
half
with
half
makes
a
nice
bread
but
it
is
not
considered
very
digestible
though
it
keeps
well
rice
can
not
be
made
into
bread
nor
can
potatoes
but
potato
flour
to
wheaten
flour
makes
a
tolerably
good
loaf
a
very
good
bread
better
than
the
ordinary
sort
and
of
a
delicious
flavour
is
said
to
be
produced
by
adopting
the
following
recipe
take
ten
parts
of
five
parts
of
one
part
of
knead
together
add
the
yeast
and
bake
as
usual
this
is
of
course
cheaper
than
wheaten
bread
flour
when
freshly
ground
is
too
glutinous
to
make
good
bread
and
should
therefore
not
be
used
immediately
but
should
be
kept
dry
for
a
few
weeks
and
stirred
occasionally
until
it
becomes
dry
and
crumbles
easily
between
the
fingers
flour
should
be
perfectly
dry
before
being
used
for
bread
or
cakes
if
at
all
damp
the
preparation
is
sure
to
be
heavy
before
mixing
it
with
the
other
ingredients
it
is
a
good
plan
to
place
it
for
an
hour
or
two
before
the
fire
until
it
feels
warm
and
dry
yeast
from
beer
is
generally
preferred
to
any
other
it
is
very
bitter
and
on
that
account
should
be
well
washed
and
put
away
until
the
thick
mass
settles
if
it
still
continues
bitter
the
process
should
be
repeated
and
before
being
used
all
the
water
floating
at
the
top
must
be
poured
off
german
yeast
is
now
very
much
used
and
should
be
moistened
and
thoroughly
mixed
with
the
milk
or
water
with
which
the
bread
is
to
be
made
the
following
observations
are
extracted
from
a
valuable
work
on
footnote
the
english
by
eliza
acton
london
longman
and
will
be
found
very
useful
to
our
readers
the
first
thing
required
for
making
wholesome
bread
is
the
utmost
cleanliness
the
next
is
the
soundness
and
sweetness
of
all
the
ingredients
used
for
it
and
in
addition
to
these
there
must
be
attention
and
care
through
the
whole
process
an
almost
certain
way
of
spoiling
dough
is
to
leave
it
and
to
allow
it
to
become
cold
before
it
is
finished
the
other
most
common
causes
of
failure
are
using
yeast
which
is
no
longer
sweet
or
which
has
been
frozen
or
has
had
hot
liquid
poured
over
it
too
small
a
proportion
of
yeast
or
insufficient
time
allowed
for
the
dough
to
rise
will
cause
the
bread
to
be
heavy
heavy
bread
will
also
most
likely
be
the
result
of
making
the
dough
very
hard
and
letting
it
become
quite
cold
particularly
in
winter
if
either
the
sponge
or
the
dough
be
permitted
to
overwork
itself
that
is
to
say
if
the
mixing
and
kneading
be
neglected
when
it
has
reached
the
proper
point
for
either
sour
bread
will
probably
be
the
consequence
in
warm
weather
and
bad
bread
in
any
the
goodness
will
also
be
endangered
by
placing
it
so
near
a
fire
as
to
make
any
part
of
it
hot
instead
of
maintaining
the
gentle
and
equal
degree
of
heat
required
for
its
due
fermentation
milk
or
milk
which
is
not
perfectly
sweet
will
not
only
injure
the
flavour
of
the
bread
but
in
sultry
weather
will
often
cause
it
to
be
quite
uneatable
yet
either
of
them
if
fresh
and
good
will
materially
improve
its
quality
to
keep
bread
sweet
and
fresh
as
soon
as
it
is
cold
it
should
be
put
into
a
clean
earthen
pan
with
a
cover
to
it
this
pan
should
be
placed
at
a
little
distance
from
the
ground
to
allow
a
current
of
air
to
pass
underneath
some
persons
prefer
keeping
bread
on
clean
wooden
shelves
without
being
covered
that
the
crust
may
not
soften
stale
bread
may
be
freshened
by
warming
it
through
in
a
gentle
oven
stale
pastry
cakes
may
also
be
improved
by
this
method
the
utensils
required
for
making
bread
on
a
moderate
scale
are
a
or
pan
sufficiently
large
that
the
dough
may
be
kneaded
freely
without
throwing
the
flour
over
the
edges
and
also
to
allow
for
its
rising
a
hair
sieve
for
straining
yeast
and
one
or
two
strong
spoons
yeast
must
always
be
good
of
its
kind
and
in
a
fitting
state
to
produce
ready
and
proper
fermentation
yeast
of
strong
beer
or
ale
produces
more
effect
than
that
of
milder
kinds
and
the
fresher
the
yeast
the
smaller
the
quantity
will
be
required
to
raise
the
dough
as
a
general
rule
the
oven
for
baking
bread
should
be
rather
quick
and
the
heat
so
regulated
as
to
penetrate
the
dough
without
hardening
the
outside
the
oven
door
should
not
be
opened
after
the
bread
is
put
in
until
the
dough
is
set
or
has
become
firm
as
the
cool
air
admitted
will
have
an
unfavourable
effect
on
it
brick
ovens
are
generally
considered
the
best
adapted
for
baking
bread
these
should
be
heated
with
wood
faggots
and
then
swept
and
mopped
out
to
cleanse
them
for
the
reception
of
the
bread
iron
ovens
are
more
difficult
to
manage
being
apt
to
burn
the
surface
of
the
bread
before
the
middle
is
baked
to
remedy
this
a
few
clean
bricks
should
be
set
at
the
bottom
of
the
oven
close
together
to
receive
the
tins
of
bread
in
many
modern
stoves
the
ovens
are
so
much
improved
that
they
bake
admirably
and
they
can
always
be
brought
to
the
required
temperature
when
it
is
higher
than
is
needed
by
leaving
the
door
open
for
a
time
a
few
hints
respecting
the
making
and
baking
of
cakes
should
always
be
broken
into
a
cup
the
whites
and
yolks
separated
and
they
should
always
be
strained
breaking
the
eggs
thus
the
bad
ones
may
be
easily
rejected
without
spoiling
the
others
and
so
cause
no
waste
as
eggs
are
used
instead
of
yeast
they
should
be
very
thoroughly
whisked
they
are
generally
sufficiently
beaten
when
thick
enough
to
carry
the
drop
that
falls
from
the
whisk
should
be
well
pounded
and
then
sifted
through
a
fine
sieve
should
be
nicely
washed
picked
dried
in
a
cloth
and
then
carefully
examined
that
no
pieces
of
grit
or
stone
may
be
left
amongst
them
they
should
then
be
laid
on
a
dish
before
the
fire
to
become
thoroughly
dry
as
if
added
damp
to
the
other
ingredients
cakes
will
be
liable
to
be
heavy
should
always
be
used
in
the
manufacture
of
cakes
and
if
beaten
to
a
cream
it
saves
much
time
and
labour
to
warm
but
not
melt
it
before
beating
less
butter
and
eggs
are
required
for
cakes
when
yeast
is
mixed
with
the
other
ingredients
the
heat
of
the
oven
is
of
great
importance
especially
for
large
cakes
if
the
heat
be
not
tolerably
fierce
the
batter
will
not
rise
if
the
oven
is
too
quick
and
there
is
any
danger
of
the
cake
burning
or
catching
put
a
sheet
of
clean
paper
over
the
top
newspaper
or
paper
that
has
been
printed
on
should
never
be
used
for
this
purpose
to
know
when
a
cake
is
sufficiently
baked
plunge
a
clean
knife
into
the
middle
of
it
draw
it
quickly
out
and
if
it
looks
in
the
least
sticky
put
the
cake
back
and
close
the
oven
door
until
the
cake
is
done
cakes
should
be
kept
in
closed
tin
canisters
or
jars
and
in
a
dry
place
those
made
with
yeast
do
not
keep
so
long
as
those
made
without
it
biscuits
since
the
establishment
of
the
large
modern
biscuit
manufactories
biscuits
have
been
produced
both
cheap
and
wholesome
in
comparatively
speaking
endless
variety
their
actual
component
parts
are
perhaps
known
only
to
the
various
makers
but
there
are
several
kinds
of
biscuits
which
have
long
been
in
use
that
may
here
be
advantageously
described
biscuits
belong
to
the
class
of
unfermented
bread
and
are
perhaps
the
most
wholesome
of
that
class
in
cases
where
fermented
bread
does
not
agree
with
the
human
stomach
they
may
be
recommended
in
many
instances

they
take

at

sorting
it
most
carefully

expeditiously

throwing

grain
into

done

is
ground
between

circular
stones
as
it
was

in

years

motion
being

mule
which
paces
round
and
round
with
untiring
patience
a
bell
being
attached
to
his
neck
which
as
long
as
he
is
in
movement
tinkles
on
and
when
it
stops
he
is
urged
to
his
duty
by
the
shout
of
from
some
one
within
hearing
when
ground
the
wheat
is
sifted
through
three
sieves
the
last
of
these
being
so
fine
that
only
the
pure
flour
can
pass
through
it
this
is
of
a
pale
the
bread
is
made
in
the
evening
it
is
mixed
with
only
sufficient
water
with
a
little
salt
in
it
to
make
it
into

a
very
small
quantity

mixture
is
added

scripture
says
a
little
leaven
leaveneth
the
whole
lump
but
in
england
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
kneading
many
put
as
much
leaven
or
yeast
in
one
batch
of
household
bread
as
in
spain
would
last
them
a
week
for
the
six
or
eight
of
bread
they
send
every
night
from
their
oven

dough
made
it
is
put
into
sacks

carried
on
the
donkeys
backs
to

as
to
bake
it

arriving
there
the

is
divided
into
portions
weighing
lbs
each
two
long
narrow
wooden
tables
on
trestles
are
then
placed
down
the
room
and
now
a
curious
sight
may
be
seen
about
twenty
men
bakers
come
in
and
range
themselves
on
one
side
of
the
tables
a
lump
of
dough
is
handed
to
the
nearest
which
he
commences
kneading
and
knocking
about
with
all
his
might
for
about
or
minutes
and
then
passes
it
on
to
his
neighbour
who
does
the
same
and
so
on
successively
until
all
have
kneaded
it
when
it
becomes
as
soft
as
new
putty
and
ready
for
the
oven
of
course
as
soon
as
the
first
baker
has
handed
the
first
lump
to
his
neighbour
another
is
given
to
him
and
so
on
till
the
whole
quantity
of
dough
is
successively
kneaded
by
them
all
the
bakers
wives
and
daughters
shape
the
loaves
for
the
oven
and
some
of
them
are
very
small
and
they
are
baked
immediately
the
ovens
are
very
large
and
not
heated
by

them
but
a
quantity
of
twigs
of
the
herbs
of
sweet
marjoram
and
thyme
which
cover
the
hills
in

profusion
are
put
in

oven
and
ignited
they
heat
the
oven
to
any
extent
required
and
as
the
bread
gets
baked
the
oven
gets
gradually
colder
so
the
bread
is
never
burned
they
knead
the
bread
in
spain
with
such
force
that
the
palm
of
the
hand
and
the
second
joints
of
the
fingers
of

wheat
wheat
is
liable
to
several
diseases
which
affect
the
flour
made
from
it
and
render
it
unfit
for
good
bread
the
principal
of
these
are
the
blight
mildew
and
smut
which
are
occasioned
by
microscopic
fungi
which
sow
themselves
and
grow
upon
the
stems
and
ears
destroying
the
nutritive
principles
and
introducing
matter
of
a
deleterious
kind
the

at
the

pains
to
keep

these
intruders
wheat
as
well
as
all
kinds
of
corn
is
also
very
liable
to
be
injured
by
being
stacked
before
it
is
quite
dry
in
which
case
it
will
heat
and
become
musty
in
the
ricks
in
wet
harvests
it
is
sometimes
impossible
to
get
it
sufficiently
dried
and
a
great
deal
of
corn
is
thus
often
spoiled
it
is
generally
reckoned
that
the
sweetest
bread
is
made
from
wheat
threshed
out
before
it
is
stacked
which
shows
the
importance
of
studying
the
best
modes
of
preserving
it

classes

consisting
of
water
containing
a

the

cheers

not
inebriates
the
beverage
called
tea
has
now
become
almost
a
necessary
of
life
previous
to
the
middle
of
the
century
it
was
not
used
in
england
and
it
was
wholly
unknown
to
the
greeks
and
romans
pepys
says
in
his
diary
september
i
sent
for
a
cup
of
tea
a
china
drink
of
which
i
had
never
drunk
before
two
years
later
it
was
so
rare
a
commodity
in
england
that
the
english
company
bought
lbs
oz
of
it
as
a
present
for
his
majesty
in
it
was
sold
in
london
for
sixty
shillings
a
pound
from
that
date
the
consumption
has
gone
on
increasing
from
lbs
to
lbs
linnaeus
was
induced
to
think
that
there
were
two
species
of
one
of
which
produced
the
black
and
the
other
the
green
teas
but
later
observations
do
not
confirm
this
when
the
leaves
of
black
and
green
tea
are
expanded
by
hot
water
and
examined
by
the
botanist
though
a
difference
of
character
is
perceived
yet
this
is
not
sufficient
to
authorize
considering
them
as
distinct
species

regions

of

country

cultivation
of
the
plant

care
it
is
raised

on
the
sides
of
hills
and
in
order
to
increase
the
quantity
and
improve
the
quality
of

the
shrub
is
pruned
so
as
not
to
exceed
the
height
of
from
two
to
three
feet

in

manner
as
the

is
treated

the
leaves

them

kinds

the

we
have
in

many
kinds

of
the
most
powerful
mineral
springs

however
small
the

we
daily

form
it
can
not
be
destitute
of
influence
on
the
vital
processes
chinese
tea
has
frequently
been
adulterated
in
this
country
by
the
admixture
of
the
dried
leaves
of
certain
plants
the
leaves
of
the
sloe
white
thorn
ash
elder
and
some
others
have
been
employed
for
this
purpose
such
as
the
leaves
of
the
speedwell
wild
germander
black
currants
syringa
and
some
of
these
are
harmless
others
are
to
a
certain
degree
poisonous
as
for
example
are
the
leaves
of
all
the
varieties
of
the
plum
and
cherry
tribe
to
which
the
sloe
belongs
adulteration
by
means
of
these
leaves
is
by
no
means
a
new
species
of
fraud
and
several
acts
of
parliament
from
the
time
of
george
have
been
passed
specifying
severe
penalties
against
those
guilty
of
the

notwithstanding
numerous
convictions
continues

in
the

of

should
be
chosen
which
possesses
an
agreeable
odour
and
is
as
whole
as
possible
in
order
that
the
leaf
may
be
easily
examined
the
greatest
care
should
be
taken
that
it
has
not
been
exposed
to
the

which
destroys
its
flavour
it
would
be
impossible
in
the

at
our
command
to
enumerate
the
various
modes
adopted
in
different
countries
for
making
coffee
that
is
the
phrase
commonly
understood
to
mean
the
complete
preparation
of
this
delicious
beverage
for
drinking
for
performing
this
operation
such
recipes
or
methods
as
we
have
found
most
practical
will
be
inserted
in
their
proper
place
but
the
following
facts
connected
with
coffee
will
be
found
highly
interesting
the
introduction
of
coffee
into
this
country
is
comparatively
of
recent
date
we
are
assured
by
bruce
that
the
is
a
native
of
abyssinia
and
it
is
said
to
have
been
cultivated
in
that
country
from
time
immemorial
it
appears
that
coffee
was
first
introduced
into
england
by
daniel
edwards
a
turkey
merchant
whose
servant
pasqua
a
greek
understood
the
manner
of
roasting
it
this
servant
under
the
patronage
of
edwards
established
the
first
in
london
in
george
yard
lombard
street
coffee
was
then
sold
at
four
or
five
guineas
a
pound
and
a
duty
was
soon
afterwards
laid
upon
it
of
fourpence
a
gallon
when
made
into
a
beverage
in
the
course
of
two
centuries
however
this
berry
unknown
originally
as
an
article
of
food
except
to
some
savage
tribes
on
the
confines
of
abyssinia
has
made
its
way
through
the
whole
of
the
civilized
world
mahommedans
of
all
ranks
drink
coffee
twice
a
day
it
is
in
universal
request
in
france
and
the
demand
for
it
throughout
the
british
isles
is
daily
increasing
the
more
especially
since
so
much
attention
has
been
given
to
mechanical
contrivances
for
roasting
and
grinding
the
berry
and
preparing
the
beverage
of
the
various
kinds
of
coffee
the
arabian
is
considered
the
best
it
is
grown
chiefly
in
the
districts
of
aden
and
mocha
whence
the
name
of
our
mocha
coffee
mocha
coffee
has
a
smaller
and
rounder
bean
than
any
other
and
likewise
a
more
agreeable
smell
and
taste
the
next
in
reputation
and
quality
is
the
java
and
ceylon
coffee
and
then
the
coffees
of
bourbon
and
martinique
and
that
of
berbice
a
district
of
the
colony
of
british
guiana
the
jamaica
and
domingo
coffees
are
less
esteemed
a
considerable
change
takes
place
in
the
arrangement
of
the
constituents
of
coffee
by
the
application
of
heat
in
roasting
it
independently
of
one
of
the
objects
of
roasting
namely
that
of
destroying
its
toughness
and
rendering
it
easily
ground
its
tannin
and
other
principles
are
rendered
partly
soluble
in
water
and
it
is
to
the
tannin
that
the
brown
colour
of
the
decoction
of
coffee
is
owing
an
aromatic
flavour
is
likewise
developed
during
torrefaction
which
is
not
perceived
in
the
raw
berry
and
which
is
not
produced
in
the
greatest
perfection
until
the
heat
has
arrived
at
a
certain
degree
of
temperature
but
if
the
heat
be
increased
beyond
this
the
flavour
is
again
dissipated
and
little
remains
but
a
bitter
and
astringent
matter
with
carbon
the
roasting
of
coffee
in
the
best
manner
requires
great
nicety
and
much
of
the
qualities
of
the
beverage
depends
upon
the
operation
the
roasting
of
coffee
for
the
dealers
in
london
and
paris
has
now
become
a
separate
branch
of
business
and
some
of
the
roasters
perform
the
operation
on
a
great
scale
with
considerable
skill
roasted
coffee
loses
from
to
per
cent
by
sufficient
roasting
and
the
powder
suffers
much
by
exposure
to
the
air
but
while
raw
it
not
only
does
not
lose
its
flavour
for
a
year
or
two
but
improves
by
keeping
if
a
cup
of
the
best
coffee
be
placed
upon
a
table
boiling
hot
it
will
fill
the
room
with
its
fragrance
but
the
coffee
when
warmed
again
after
being
cold
will
be
found
to
have
lost
most
of
its
flavour
to
have
coffee
in
perfection
it
should
be
roasted
and
ground
just
before
it
is
used
and
more
should
not
be
ground
at
a
time
than
is
wanted
for
immediate
use
or
if
it
be
necessary
to
grind
more
it
should
be
kept
closed
from
the
air
coffee
readily
imbibes
exhalations
from
other
substances
and
thus
often
acquires
a
bad
flavour
brown
sugar
placed
near
it
will
communicate
a
disagreeable
flavour
it
is
stated
that
the
coffee
in
the
west
indies
has
often
been
injured
by
being
laid
in
rooms
near
the
or
where
rum
is
distilled
and
the
same
effect
has
been
produced
by
bringing
over
coffee
in
the
same
ships
with
rum
and
sugar
moseley
mentions
that
a
few
bags
of
pepper
on
board
a
ship
from
india
spoiled
a
whole
cargo
of
coffee
with
respect
to
the
quantity
of
coffee
used
in
making
the
decoction
much
depends
upon
the
taste
of
the
consumer
the
greatest
and
most
common
fault
in
english
coffee
is
the
too
small
quantity
of
the
ingredient
count
rumford
says
that
to
make
good
coffee
for
drinking
after
dinner
a
pound
of
good
mocha
coffee
which
when
roasted
and
ground
weighs
only
thirteen
ounces
serves
to
make
full

french
it
being
an
acknowledged
fact
that
french
coffee
is
decidedly
superior
to
that
made
in
england
and
as
the
roasting
of
the
berry
is
of
great
importance
to
the
flavour
of
the
preparation
it
will
be
useful
and
interesting
to
know
how
they
manage
these
things
in
france
in
paris
there
are
two
houses
justly
celebrated
for
the
flavour
of
their
coffee
maison
and
maison
royer
de
and
to
obtain
this
flavour
before
roasting
they
add
to
every
lbs
of
coffee
a
piece
of
butter
the
size
of
a
nut
and
a
of
powdered
sugar
it
is
then
roasted
in
the
usual
manner
the
addition
of
the
butter
and
sugar
develops
the
flavour
and
aroma
of
the
berry
but
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
quality
of
the
butter
must
be
of
the
very
best
description
to
make
coffee
allow
or
tablespoonful
of
ground
coffee
to
each
person
to
every

of
coffee
allow

make
coffee
good
should
never
be
but
the
boiling
water
merely
poured
on
it
the
same
as
for
tea
the
coffee
should
always
be
purchased
in
the
berry
if
possible
freshly
roasted
and
it
should
never
be
ground
long
before
it
is
wanted
for
use
there
are
very
many
new
kinds
of
but
the
method
of
making
the
coffee
is
nearly
always
the
same
namely
pouring
the
boiling
water
on
the
powder
and
allowing
it
to
filter
through
our
illustration
shows
one
of
loysel
hydrostatic
urns
which
are
admirably
adapted

should
run

strong
hot
and

the
coffee
made
in
these
urns
generally
turns
out
very
good
and
there
is
but
one
objection
to
them
the
coffee
runs
rather
slowly
from
the
tap
this
is
of
no
consequence
where
there
is
a
small
party
but
tedious
where
there
are
many
persons
to
provide
for
a
remedy
for
this
objection
may
be
suggested
namely
to
make
the
coffee
very
strong
so
that
not
more
than
of
a
cup
would
be
required
as
the
rest
would
be

many
persons
may
think
that
the
proportion
of
water

have
given
for

oz
of
coffee
is
rather
small
it
is
so
and
the
coffee
produced

it

the

plant
grows
to
the
height
of
about
twelve

fifteen
feet
with
leaves
not
unlike
those
of
the
common
laurel
although
more
pointed
and
not
so
dry
and
thick

blossoms
are
white
much
like
those

dried

says
liebig
that
thousands
have
lived
without
a
knowledge
of

daily
experience
teaches
us
that
under
certain
circumstances
they
may
be
dispensed
with
without
disadvantage
to
the
merely
animal
functions
but
it
is
an
error
certainly
to
conclude
from
this
that
they
may
be
altogether
dispensed
with
in
reference
to
their
effects
and
it
is
a
question
whether
if
we
had
no
tea
and
no
coffee
the
popular
instinct
would
not
seek
for

discover
the
means
of
replacing

science
which
accuses
us

in

have
in
the

place
to
ascertain
whether
it
depends
on
sensual
and
sinful
inclinations
merely
that
every
people
of
the

have
appropriated
some
such
means
of
acting
on
the

think
it
on
the
contrary
highly
probable
not

that
the
instinct
of

feeling

not

made
of
the
essence
of
coffee
no
by
pouring
a
tablespoonful
into
each
cup
and
filling
it
up
with
boiling
water
this
is
a
very
simple
and
expeditious
manner
of
preparing
coffee
for
a
large
party
but
the
essence
for
it
must
be
made
very
good
and
kept
well
corked
until
required
for
use
to
make
tea
there
is
very
little
art
in
making
good
tea
if
the
water
is
boiling
and
there
is
no
sparing
of
the

almost
invariably
be

a

to

the
lid
and
let
it
stand
for

to
draw
from
to
minutes
then
fill
up
the
pot
with
water
the
tea
will
be
quite
spoiled
unless
made
with
water
that
is
actually
as
the
leaves
will
not
open
and
the
flavour
not
be
extracted
from
them
the
beverage
will
consequently
be
colourless
and
tasteless
in
fact
nothing
but
tepid
water
where
there
is
a
very
large
party
to
make
tea
for
it
is
a
good
plan
to
have
two
teapots
instead
of
putting
a
large
quantity
of
tea
into
one
pot
the
tea
besides
will
go
farther
when
the
infusion
has
been
once
completed
the
addition
of
fresh
tea
adds
very
little
to
the
strength
so
when
more
is
required
have
the
pot
emptied
of
the
old
leaves
scalded
and
fresh
tea
made
in
the
usual
manner
economists
say
that
a
few
grains
of
carbonate
of
soda
added
before
the
boiling
water
is
poured
on
the
tea
assist
to
draw
out
the
goodness
if
the
water
is
very
hard
perhaps
it
is
a
good
plan
as
the
soda
softens
it
but
care
must
be
taken
to
use
this
ingredient
sparingly
as
it
is
liable
to
give
the
tea
a
soapy
taste
if
added
in
too
large
a
quantity
for
mixed
tea
the
usual
proportion
is
four
spoonfuls
of
black
to
one
of
green
more
of
the
latter
when
the
flavour
is
very
much
liked

pernicious

a
few
rules
to
be
observed
in
cooking
for
invalids
let
all
the
kitchen
utensils
used
in
the
preparation
of
cookery
be
delicately
and
clean
if
this
is
not
the
case
a
disagreeable
flavour
may
be
imparted
to
the
preparation
which
flavour
may
disgust
and
prevent
the
patient
from
partaking
of
the
refreshment
when
brought
to
him
or
her
for
invalids
never
make
a
large
quantity
of
one
thing
as
they
seldom
require
much
at
a
time
and
it
is
desirable
that
variety
be
provided
for
them
always
have
something
in
readiness
a
little
beef
tea
nicely
made
and
nicely
skimmed
a
few
spoonfuls
of
jelly
that
it
may
be
administered
as
soon
almost
as
the
invalid
wishes
for
it
if
obliged
to
wait
a
long
time
the
patient
loses
the
desire
to
eat
and
often
turns
against
the
food
when
brought
to
him
or
her
in
sending
dishes
or
preparations
up
to
invalids
let
everything
look
as
tempting
as
possible
have
a
clean
laid
smoothly
over
the
tray
let
the
spoons
tumblers
cups
and
saucers
be
very
clean
and
bright
gruel
served
in
a
tumbler
is
more
appetizing
than
when
served
in
a
basin
or
cup
and
saucer
as
milk
is
an
important
article
of
food
for
the
sick
in
warm
weather
let
it
be
kept
on
ice
to
prevent
its
turning
sour
many
other
delicacies
may
also
be
preserved
good
in
the
same
manner
for
some
little
time
if
the
patient
be
allowed
to
eat
vegetables
never
send
them
up
undercooked
or
half
raw
and
let
a
small
quantity
only
be
temptingly
arranged
on
a
dish
this
rule
will
apply
to
every
preparation
as
an
invalid
is
much
more
likely
to
enjoy
his
food
if
small
delicate
pieces
are
served
to
him
never
leave
food
about
a
sick
room
if
the
patient
can
not
eat
it
when
brought
to
him
take
it
away
and
bring
it
to
him
in
an
hour
or
two
time
miss
nightingale
says
to
leave
the
patient
untasted
food
by
his
side
from
meal
to
meal
in
hopes
that
he
will
eat
it
in
the
interval
is
simply
to
prevent
him
from
taking
any
food
at

she
says
i
have
known
patients
literally
incapacitated
from
taking
one
article
of
food
after
another

ignorance
let
the
food
come
at
the
right
time
and
be
taken
away
eaten
or
uneaten
at
the
right
time
but
never
let
a
patient
have
always
standing
by
him
if
you
do
wish
to
disgust
him
of
everything
never
serve
beef
tea
or
broth
with
the
of
fat
or
grease
on
the
surface
it
is
better
after
making
either
of
these
to
allow
them
to
get
perfectly
cold
when
the
may
be
easily
removed
then
warm
up
as
much
as
may
be
required
two
or
three
pieces
of
clean
paper
laid
on
the
broth
will
absorb
any
greasy
particles
that
may
be
floating
at
the

will
cling
to

chop
nicely
cut

dish
to

it
must
not
be
served
all
the

nor
must

notes

no
mother
or
nurse
should
be
without
she
says
you
can
not
be
too
careful
as
to
quality
in

diet
a
nurse
should
never
put
before
a
patient

that
is
sour
meat
or
soup
that
is
turned
an
egg
that
is
bad
or
vegetables
underdone

often
she
says
she
has
seen
these
things
brought
in
to
the
sick
in
a
state
perfectly
perceptible
to
every
nose
or
eye
except
the
nurse
it
is
here
that
the
clever
nurse
appears
she
will
not
bring
in
the
peccant
article
but
not
to
disappoint
the
patient
she
will
whip
up
something
else
in
a

minutes
remember
that
sick
cookery
should
half
do
the

of
your
poor

digestion
she
goes
on
to
caution
nurses
by
saying
take
care
not
to
spill
into
your
patient
saucer
in
other
words
take
care
that
the
outside
bottom
rim
of
his
cup
shall
be
quite
dry
and
clean
if
every
time
he
lifts
his
cup
to
his
lips
he
has
to
carry
the
saucer
with
it
or
else
to
drop
the
liquid
upon
and
to
soil
his
sheet
or
bedgown
or
pillow
or
if
he
is
sitting
up
his
dress
you
have
no
idea
what
a
difference
this

want
of
care
on
your
part
makes

says

certain

will
often
take

repeatedly

they
refuse
all

this
is
particularly
remarkable

he
says
little

nothing
else

a

contains
scarcely

our
great
nurse
miss
nightingale
remarks
that
a
great
deal
too
much
against
tea
is
said
by
wise
people
and
a
great
deal
too
much
of
tea
is
given
to
the
sick
by
foolish
people
when
you
see
the
natural
and
almost
universal
craving
in
english
sick
for
their
you
can
not
but
feel
that
nature
knows
what
she
is
about
but
a
little
tea
or
coffee
restores
them
quite
as
much
as
a
great
deal
and
a
great
deal
of
tea
and
especially
of
coffee
impairs
the
little
power
of
digestion
they
have
yet
a
nurse
because
she
sees
how
one
or
two
cups
of
tea
or
coffee
restore
her
patient
thinks
that
three
or
four
cups
will
do
twice
as
much
this
is
not
the
case
at
all
it
is
however
certain
that
there
is
nothing
yet
discovered
which
is
a
substitute
to
the
english
patient
for
his
cup
of
tea
he
can
take
it
when
he
can
take
nothing
else
and
he
often
ca
take
anything
else
if
he
has
it
not
coffee
is
a
better
restorative
than
tea
but
a
greater
impairer
of
the
digestion
in
making
coffee
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
buy
it
in
the
berry
and
grind
it
at
home
otherwise
you
may
reckon
upon
its
containing
a
certain
amount
of
chicory
at
least
this
is
not
a
question
of
the
taste
or
of
the
wholesomeness
of
chicory
it
is
that
chicory
has
nothing
at
all
of
the
properties
for
which
you
give
coffee
and
therefore
you
may
as
well
not
give
it

dining
is
the
privilege
of
civilization
the
rank
which
a
people
occupy
in
the
grand
scale
may
be
measured
by
their
way
of
taking
their
meals
as
well
as
by
their
way
of
treating
their
women
the
nation
which
knows
how
to
dine
has
learnt
the
leading
lesson
of
progress
it
implies
both
the
will
and
the
skill
to
reduce
to
order
and
surround
with
idealisms
and
graces
the
more
material
conditions
of
human
existence
and
wherever
that
will
and
that
skill
exist
life
can
not
be
wholly
ignoble
dinner
being
the
grand
solid
meal
of
the
day
is
a
matter
of
considerable
importance
and
a
table
is
a
striking
index
of
human
ingenuity
and
resource
their
table
says
lord
byron
in
describing
a
given
by
lord
and
lady
amundevillo
at
norman
abbey
their
table
was
a
board
to
tempt
even
ghosts
to
pass
the
styx
for
more
substantial
feasts
i
will
not
dwell
upon
ragouts
or
roasts
albeit
all
human
history
attests
that
happiness
for
man
the
hungry
sinner
since
eve
ate
apples
much
depends
on
dinner
and
then
he
goes
on
to
observe
upon
the
curious
complexity
of
the
results
produced
by
human
cleverness
and
application
catering
for
the
modifications
which
occur
in
civilized
life
one
of
the
simplest
of
the
primal
instincts
the
mind
is
lost
in
mighty
contemplation
of
intellect
expended
on
two
courses
and
indigestion
grand
multiplication
requires
arithmetic
beyond
my
forces
who
would
suppose
from
adam
simple
ration
that
cookery
could
have
call
forth
such
resources
as
form
a
science
and
a
nomenclature
from
out
the
commonest
demands
of
nature
and
we
may
well
say
who
indeed
would
suppose
it
the
gulf
between
the
croat
with
a
steak
under
his
saddle
and
alexis
soyer
getting
up
a
great
dinner
at
the
or
even
thackeray
raymond
gray
giving
a
little
dinner
to
snob
with
one
of
those
famous
puddings
of
hers
what
a
gulf
it
is
that
adam
ration
however
was
simple
is
a
matter
on
which
we
have
contrary
judgments
given
by
the
poets
when
raphael
paid
that
memorable
visit
to
paradise
which
we
are
expressly
told
by
milton
he
did
exactly
at
eve
seems
to
have
prepared
a
little
dinner
not
wholly
destitute
of
complexity
and
to
have
added
and
perfumes
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
the
testimony
of
the
poet
on
these
points
and
eve
within
due
at
her
home
prepared
for
dinner
savoury
fruits
of
taste
to
please
true
appetite
and
not
disrelish
thirst
of
nectarous
draughts
between
with
dispatchful
looks
in
haste
she
turns
on
hospitable
thoughts
intent
what
choice
to
choose
for
delicacy
best
what
order
so
contrived
as
not
to
mix
tastes
not
well
join
inelegant
but
bring
taste
after
taste
upheld
with
kindliest
change
she
dulcet
strews
the
ground
with
rose
and
it
may
be
observed
in
passing
that
the
poets
though
they
have
more
to
say
about
wine
than
solid
food
because
the
former
more
directly
stimulates
the
intellect
and
the
feelings
do
not
flinch
from
the
subject
of
eating
and
drinking
there
is
infinite
zest
in
the
above
passage
from
milton
and
even
more
in
the
famous
description
of
a
dainty
supper
given
by
keats
in
his
eve
of
saint
agnes
could
queen
mab
herself
desire
to
sit
down
to
anything
nicer
both
as
to
its
appointments
and
serving
and
as
to
its
quality
than
the
collation
served
by
porphyro
in
the
lady
bedroom
while
she
slept
there
by
the
bedside
where
the
faded
moon
made
a
dim
silver
twilight
soft
he
set
a
table
and
threw
thereor
a
cloth
of
woven
crimson
gold
and
jet
while
he
from
forth
the
closet
brought
a
heap
of
candied
apple
quince
and
plum
and
gourd
with
jellies
smoother
than
the
creamy
curd
and
lucent
syrups
tinct
with
cinnamon
manna
and
dates
in
argosy
from
fez
and
spiced
dainties
every
one
from
silken
samarcand
to
cedar
lebanon
but
tennyson
has
ventured
beyond
dates
and
quinces
and
syrups
which
may
be
thought
easy
to
be
brought
in
by
a
poet
in
his
idyl
of
audley
court
he
gives
a
most
appetizing
description
of
a
pasty
at
a
there
on
a
slope
of
orchard
francis
laid
a
damask
napkin
wrought
with
horse
and
hound
brought
out
a
dusky
loaf
that
smelt
of
home
and
half
cut
down
a
pasty
costly
made
where
quail
and
pigeon
lark
and
leveret
lay
like
fossils
of
the
rock
with
golden
yolks
imbedded
and
injellied
we
gladly
quote
passages
like
these
to
show
how
eating
and
drinking
may
be
surrounded
with
poetical
associations
and
how
man
using
his
privilege
to
turn
any
and
every
repast
into
a
feast
of
reason
with
a
warm
and
plentiful
flow
of
soul
may
really
count
it
as
not
the
least
of
his
legitimate
prides
that
he
is
a
dining
animal
it
has
been
said
indeed
that
great
men
in
general
are
great
diners
this
however
can
scarcely
be
true
of
any
great
men
but
men
of
action
and
in
that
case
it
would
simply
imply
that
persons
of
vigorous
constitution
who
work
hard
eat
heartily
for
of
course
a
life
of
action
a
vigorous
constitution
even
though
there
may
be
much
illness
as
in
such
cases
as
william
iii
and
our
brave
general
napier
of
men
of
thought
it
can
scarcely
be
true
that
they
eat
so
much
in
a
general
way
though
even
they
eat
more
than
they
are
apt
to
suppose
they
do
for
as
lewes
observes
is
very
expensive
leaving
great
men
of
all
kinds
however
to
get
their
own
dinners
let
us
who
are
not
great
look
after
ours
dine
we
must
and
we
may
as
well
dine
elegantly
as
well
as
wholesomely
there
are
plenty
of
elegant
dinners
in
modern
days
and
they
were
not
wanting
in
ancient
times
it
is
well
known
that
the
or
symposium
was
a
not
unimportant
and
not
unpoetical
feature
in
the
life
of
the
sociable
talkative
tasteful
greek
douglas
jerrold
said
that
such
is
the
british
humour
for
dining
and
giving
of
dinners
that
if
london
were
to
be
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
the
londoners
would
meet
at
a
public
dinner
to
consider
the
subject
the
greeks
too
were
great
diners
their
social
and
religious
polity
gave
them
many
chances
of
being
merry
and
making
others
merry
on
good
eating
and
drinking
any
public
or
even
domestic
sacrifice
to
one
of
the
gods
was
sure
to
be
followed
by
a
the
remains
of
the
slaughtered
offering
being
served
up
on
the
occasion
as
a
pious
de
résistance
and
as
the
different
gods
goddesses
and
demigods
worshipped
by
the
community
in
general
or
by
individuals
were
very
numerous
indeed
and
some
very
religious
people
never
let
a
day
pass
without
offering
up
something
or
other
the
were
countless
a
birthday
too
was
an
excuse
for
a
dinner
a
birthday
that
is
of
any
person
long
dead
and
buried
as
well
as
of
a
living
person
being
a
member
of
the
family
or
otherwise
esteemed
dinners
were
of
course
eaten
on
all
occasions
of
public
rejoicing
then
among
the
young
people
subscription
dinners
very
much
after
the
manner
of
modern
times
were
always
being
got
up
only
that
they
would
be
eaten
not
at
an
hotel
but
probably
at
the
house
of
one
of
the
a
greek
was
a
handsome
affair
the
guests
came
in
elegantly
dressed
and
crowned
with
flowers
a
slave
approaching
each
person
as
he
entered
took
off
his
sandals
and
washed
his
feet
during
the
repast
the
guests
reclined
on
couches
with
pillows
among
and
along
which
were
set
small
tables
after
the
solid
meal
came
the
symposium
proper
a
scene
of
music
merriment
and
dancing
the
two
latter
being
supplied
chiefly
by
young
girls
there
was
a
chairman
or
symposiarch
appointed
by
the
company
to
regulate
the
drinking
and
it
was
his
duty
to
mix
the
wine
in
the
mighty
bowl
from
this
bowl
the
attendants
ladled
the
liquor
into
goblets
and
with
the
goblets
went
round
and
round
the
tables
filling
the
cups
of
the
guests
the
elegance
with
which
a
dinner
is
served
is
a
matter
which
depends
of
course
partly
upon
the
means
but
still
more
upon
the
taste
of
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
it
may
be
observed
in
general
that
there
should
always
be
flowers
on
the
table
and
as
they
form
no
item
of
expense
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
employed
every
day
the
variety
in
the
dishes
which
furnish
forth
a
modern
does
not
necessarily
imply
anything
unwholesome
or
anything
capricious
food
that
is
not
well
relished
can
not
be
well
digested
and
the
appetite
of
the
man
of
business
or
statesman
or
of
any
dweller
in
towns
whose
occupations
are
exciting
and
exhausting
is
jaded
and
requires
stimulation
men
and
women
who
are
in
rude
health
and
who
have
plenty
of
air
and
exercise
eat
the
simplest
food
with
relish
and
consequently
digest
it
well
but
those
conditions
are
out
of
the
reach
of
many
men
they
must
suit
their
mode
of
dining
to
their
mode
of
living
if
they
can
not
choose
the
latter
it
is
in
serving
up
food
that
is
at
once
appetizing
and
wholesome
that
the
skill
of
the
modern
housewife
is
severely
tasked
and
she
has
scarcely
a
more
important
duty
to
fulfil
it
is
in
fact
her
particular
vocation
in
virtue
of
which
she
may
be
said
to
hold
the
health
of
the
family
and
of
the
friends
of
the
family
in
her
hands
from
day
to
day
it
has
been
said
that
the
destiny
of
nations
depends
on
the
manner
in
which
they
are
fed
and
a
great
gastronomist
exclaims
tell
me
what
kind
of
food
you
eat
and
i
will
tell
you
what
kind
of
man
you
are
the
same
writer
has
some
sentences
of
the
same
kind
which
are
rather
hyperbolical
but
worth
quoting
the
pleasures
of
the
table
belong
to
all
ages
to
all
conditions
to
all
countries
and
to
all
eras
they
mingle
with
all
other
pleasures
and
remain
at
last
to
console
us
for
their
departure
the
discovery
of
a
new
dish
confers
more
happiness
upon
humanity
than
the
discovery
of
a
new
star
the
gastronomist
from
whom
we
have
already
quoted
has
some
aphorisms
and
short
directions
in
relation
to
which
are
well
deserving
of
notice
let
the
number
of
your
guests
never
exceed
twelve
so
that
the
conversation
may
be
general
footnote
we
have
seen
this
varied
by
saying
that
the
number
should
never
exceed

of

there
being

for

there
it
perhaps
no

enjoyable
as
this

may
be
done

the
arrangement
of

should
be
plenty
of

and
the

should
be
well
lighted
we
have
endeavoured
to
show
how
the

may
be
placed

of
course
these
little

entirely
depend
on
the

whether
the

are
arranged

down

one
at

whether
the

is

the

of

has
also
much
to
do

to
abuse
its
servants

such
as
leads
their
lords
and
masters
to
talk
of
the
weather
and
when
rurally
inclined
of
the
crops
leads
matronly
ladies
and
ladies
just
entering
on
their
probation
in
that
honoured
and
honourable
state
to
talk
of
servants
and
as
we
are
told
wax
eloquent
over
the
greatest
plague
in
life
while
taking
a
quiet
cup
of
tea
young
men
at
their
clubs
also
we
are
told
like
to
abuse
their
fellows
perhaps
not
without
a
certain
pride
and
pleasure
at
the
opportunity
of
intimating
that
they
enjoy
such
appendages
to
their
state
it
is
another
conviction
of
society
that
the
race
of
good
servants
has
died
out
at
least
in
england
although
they
do
order
these
things
better
in
france
that
there
is
neither
honesty
conscientiousness
nor
the
careful
and
industrious
habits
which
distinguished
the
servants
of
our
grandmothers
and
that
domestics
no
longer
know
their
place
that
the
introduction
of
cheap
silks
and
cottons
and
still
more
recently
those
ambiguous
materials
and
tweeds
have
removed
the
landmarks
between
the
mistress
and
her
maid
between
the
master
and
his
man
when
the
distinction
really
depends
on
things
so
insignificant
this
is
very
probably
the
case
when
the
lady
of
fashion
chooses
her
footman
without
any
other
consideration
than
his
height
shape
and
of
his
calf
it
is
not
surprising
that
she
should
find
a
domestic
who
has
no
attachment
for
the
family
who
considers
the
figure
he
cuts
behind
her
carriage
and
the
late
hours
he
is
compelled
to
keep
a
full
compensation
for
the
wages
he
exacts
for
the
food
he
wastes
and
for
the
perquisites
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
nor
should
the
fast
young
man
who
chooses
his
groom
for
his
knowingness
in
the
ways
of
the
turf
and
in
the
tricks
of
low
be
surprised
if
he
is
sometimes
the
victim
of
these
learned
ways
but
these
are
the
exceptional
cases
which
prove
the
existence
of
a
better
state
of
things
the
great
masses
of
society
among
us
are
not
thus
deserted
there
are
few
families
of
respectability
from
the
shopkeeper
in
the
next
street
to
the
nobleman
whose
mansion
dignifies
the
next
square
which
do
not
contain
among
their
dependents
attached
and
useful
servants
and
where
these
are
absent
altogether
there
are
good
reasons
for
it
the
sensible
master
and
the
kind
mistress
know
that
if
servants
depend
on
them
for
their
means
of
living
in
their
turn
they
are
dependent
on
their
servants
for
very
many
of
the
comforts
of
life
and
that
with
a
proper
amount
of
care
in
choosing
servants
and
treating
them
like
reasonable
beings
and
making
slight
excuses
for
the
shortcomings
of
human
nature
they
will
save
in
some
exceptional
case
be
tolerably
well
served
and
in
most
instances
surround
themselves
with
attached
domestics
this
remark
which
is
applicable
to
all
domestics
is
especially
so
to
families
accustomed
to
such
attendants
have
always
about
them
humble
dependents
whose
children
have
no
other
prospect
than
domestic
service
to
look
forward
to
to
them
it
presents
no
degradation
but
the
reverse
to
be
so
employed
they
are
initiated
step
by
step
into
the
mysteries
of
the
household
with
the
prospect
of
rising
in
the
service
if
it
is
a
house
admitting
of
promotion
to
the
respectable
position
of
butler
or
in
families
of
humbler
pretensions
where
they
must
look
for
promotion
elsewhere
they
know
that
can
only
be
attained
by
acquiring
the
goodwill
of
their
employers
can
there
be
any
stronger
security
for
their
good
conduct
any
doubt
that
in
the
mass
of
domestic
servants
good
conduct
is
the
rule
the
reverse
the
exception
the
number
of
the
male
domestics
in
a
family
varies
according
to
the
wealth
and
position
of
the
master
from
the
owner
of
the
ducal
mansion
with
a
retinue
of
attendants
at
the
head
of
which
is
the
chamberlain
and
to
the
occupier
of
the
humbler
house
where
a
single
footman
or
even
the
odd
is
the
only
male
retainer
the
majority
of
gentlemen
establishments
probably
comprise
a
servant
out
of
livery
or
butler
a
footman
and
coachman
or
coachman
and
groom
where
the
horses
exceed
two
or
three
duties
of
the
butler
the
domestic
duties
of
the
butler
are
to
bring
in
the
eatables
at
breakfast
and
wait
upon
the
family
at
that
meal
assisted
by
the
footman
and
see
to
the
cleanliness
of
everything
at
table
on
taking
away
he
removes
the
tray
with
the
china
and
plate
for
which
he
is
responsible
at
luncheon
he
arranges
the
meal
and
waits
unassisted
the
footman
being
now
engaged
in
other
duties
at
dinner
he
places
the
silver
and
plated
articles
on
the
table
sees
that
everything
is
in
its
place
and
rectifies
what
is
wrong
he
carries
in
the
first
dish
and
announces
in
the
that
dinner
is
on
the
table
and
respectfully
stands
by
the
door
until
the
company
are
seated
when
he
takes
his
place
behind
his
master
chair
on
the
left
to
remove
the
covers
handing
them
to
the
other
attendants
to
carry
out
after
the
first
course
of
plates
is
supplied
his
place
is
at
the
sideboard
to
serve
the
wines
but
only
when
called
on
the
first
course
ended
he
rings
the
cook
bell
and
hands
the
dishes
from
the
table
to
the
other
servants
to
carry
away
receiving
from
them
the
second
course
which
he
places
on
the
table
removing
the
covers
as
before
and
again
taking
his
place
at
the
sideboard
at
dessert
the
slips
being
removed
the
butler
receives
the
dessert
from
the
other
servants
and
arranges
it
on
the
table
with
plates
and
glasses
and
then
takes
his
place
behind
his
master
chair
to
hand
the
wines
and
ices
while
the
footman
stands
behind
his
mistress
for
the
same
purpose
the
other
attendants
leaving
the
room
where
the
practice
of
having
the
dessert
on
the
polished
table
without
any
cloth
is
still
adhered
to
the
butler
should
rub
off
any
marks
made
by
the
hot
dishes
before
arranging
the
dessert
before
dinner
he
has
satisfied
himself
that
the
lamps
candles
or
are
in
perfect
order
if
not
lighted
which
will
usually
be
the
case
having
served
every
one
with
their
share
of
the
dessert
put
the
fires
in
order
when
these
are
used
and
seen
the
lights
are
all
right
at
a
signal
from
his
master
he
and
the
footman
leave
the
room
he
now
proceeds
to
the
arranges
the
fireplace
and
sees
to
the
lights
he
then
returns
to
his
pantry
prepared
to
answer
the
bell
and
attend
to
the
company
while
the
footman
is
clearing
away
and
cleaning
the
plate
and
glasses
at
tea
he
again
attends
at
bedtime
he
appears
with
the
candles
he
locks
up
the
plate
secures
doors
and
windows
and
sees
that
all
the
fires
are
safe
in
addition
to
these
duties
the
butler
where
only
one
footman
is
kept
will
be
required
to
perform
some
of
the
duties
of
the
valet
to
pay
bills
and
superintend
the
other
servants
but
the
real
duties
of
the
butler
are
in
the
there
he
should
be
competent
to
advise
his
master
as
to
the
price
and
quality
of
the
wine
to
be
laid
in
fine
bottle
cork
and
seal
it
and
place
it
in
the
binns
brewing
racking
and
bottling
malt
liquors
belong
to
his
office
as
well
as
their
distribution
these
and
other
drinkables
are
brought
from
the
cellar
every
day
by
his
own
hands
except
where
an
is
kept
and
a
careful
entry
of
every
bottle
used
entered
in
the
so
that
the
book
should
always
show
the
contents
of
the
cellar
the
office
of
butler
is
thus
one
of
very
great
trust
in
a
household
here
as
elsewhere
honesty
is
the
best
policy
the
butler
should
make
it
his
business
to
understand
the
proper
treatment
of
the
different
wines
under
his
charge
which
he
can
easily
do
from
the
and
faithfully
attend
to
it
his
own
reputation
will
soon
compensate
for
the
absence
of
bribes
from
unprincipled
if
he
serves
a
generous
and
hospitable
master
nothing
spreads
more
rapidly
in
society
than
the
reputation
of
a
good
and
all
that
is
required
is
wines
well
chosen
and
well
cared
for
and
this
a
little
knowledge
carefully
applied
will
soon
supply
the
butler
we
have
said
has
charge
of
the
contents
of
the
cellars
and
it
is
his
duty
to
keep
them
in
a
proper
condition
to
fine
down
wine
in
wood
bottle
it
off
and
store
it
away
in
places
suited
to
the
sorts
where
wine
comes
into
the
cellar
ready
bottled
it
is
usual
to
return
the
same
number
of
empty
bottles
the
butler
has
not
in
this
case
the
same
inducements
to
keep
the
bottles
of
the
different
sorts
separated
but
where
the
wine
is
bottled
in
the
house
he
will
find
his
account
not
only
in
keeping
them
separate
but
in
rinsing
them
well
and
even
washing
them
with
clean
water
as
soon
as
they
are
empty
there
are
various
modes
of
fining
wine
isinglass
gelatine
and
gum
arabic
are
all
used
for
the
purpose
whichever
of
these
articles
is
used
the
process
is
always
the
same
supposing
eggs
the
cheapest
to
be
used
draw
a
gallon
or
so
of
the
wine
and
mix
one
quart
of
it
with
the
whites
of
four
eggs
by
stirring
it
with
a
whisk
afterwards
when
thoroughly
mixed
pour
it
back
into
the
cask
through
the
bunghole
and
stir
up
the
whole
cask
in
a
rotatory
direction
with
a
clean
split
stick
inserted
through
the
bunghole
having
stirred
it
sufficiently
pour
in
the
remainder
of
the
wine
drawn
off
until
the
cask
is
full
then
stir
again
skimming
off
the
bubbles
that
rise
to
the
surface
when
thoroughly
mixed
by
stirring
close
the
bunghole
and
leave
it
to
stand
for
three
or
four
days
this
quantity
of
clarified
wine
will
fine
thirteen
dozen
of
port
or
sherry
the
other
clearing
ingredients
are
applied
in
the
same
manner
the
material
being
cut
into
small
pieces
and
dissolved
in
the
quart
of
wine
and
the
cask
stirred
in
the
same
manner

having
thoroughly
washed
and
dried
the
bottles
supposing
they
have
been
before
used
for
the
same
kind

will
be
improved

which
is
placed
in

this
operation
is
best
performed
by
two
persons
one
to
draw
the
wine
the
other
to
cork
the

the
drawer
is
to
see
that
the

bottom
of

cask
a
thick
piece
of
muslin
is
placed
in

then
whatever
his
ostensible
position
he
is
required
to
make
himself
generally
useful
he
has
to
clean

knives
and
shoes
the
furniture
the

answer
the
visitors
who
call
the
and

and
do
all
the
errands
his
life
is
no
sinecure
and
a
methodical
arrangement
of
his
time
will
be
necessary
in
order
to
perform
his
many
duties
with
any
satisfaction
to
himself
or

master
the
footman
only
finds
himself
in
stockings
shoes
and
washing
where
silk
stockings
or
other
extra
articles
of
linen
are
worn
they
are
found
by
the

as
well
as

consisting
of
a

of

and
on
quitting
his
service
he
is
expected
to
leave
behind
him
any

had
within
six
months
the
footman
is
expected
to
rise
early
in
order
to
get
through
all
his
dirty
work
before
the

are
stirring
boots

should
be
cleaned

tidy
himself
and
appear
in
a
clean
jean
jacket
to
lay
the
cloth
and
prepare
breakfast
for
the
family
we
need
hardly
dwell
on
the
process
three
good
brushes
and
good
blacking
must
be
provided
one
of
the
brushes
hard
to
brush
off
the
mud
the
other
soft
to
lay
on
the
blacking
the
third
of
a
medium
hardness
for
polishing
and
each
should
be
kept
for
its
particular
use
the
blacking
should
be
kept
corked
up
except
when
in
use
and
applied
to
the
brush
with
a
sponge
tied
to
a
stick
which
when
put
away
rests
in
a
notch
cut
in
the
cork
when
boots
come
in
very
muddy
it
is
a
good
practice
to
wash
off
the
mud
and
wipe
them
dry
with
a
sponge
then
leave
them
to
dry
very
gradually
on
their
sides
taking
care
they
are
not
placed
near
the
fire
or
scorched
much
delicacy
of
treatment
is
required
in
cleaning
ladies
boots
so
as
to
make
the
leather
look
and
the
upper
part
retain
a
fresh
appearance
with
the
lining
free
from
which
are
very
offensive
to
a
lady
of
refined
tastes
patent
leather
boots
require
to
be
wiped
with
a
wet
sponge
and
afterwards
with
a
soft
dry
cloth
and
occasionally
with
a
soft
cloth
and
sweet
oil
blacking
and
polishing
the
edge
of
the
soles
in
the
usual
way
but
so
as
not
to
cover
the
patent
polish
with
blacking
a
little
milk
may
also
be
used
with
very
good
effect
for
patent
leather
boots
top
boots
are
still
occasionally
worn
by
gentlemen
while
cleaning
the
lower
part
in
the
usual
manner
protect
the
tops
by
inserting
a
cloth
or
brown
paper
under
the
edges
and
bringing
it
over
them
in
cleaning
the
tops
let
the
covering
fall
down
over
the
boot
wash
the
tops
clean
with
soap
and
flannel
and
rub
out
any
spots
with
if
the
tops
are
to
be
whiter
dissolve
an
ounce
of
oxalic
acid
and
half
an
ounce
of
in
a
pint
of
soft
water
if
a

colour
is
intended
mix
an
ounce
of

now
generally
cleaned
by

of
kent
or
masters
machine
which
gives
very
little
trouble
and
is
very
effective
before
however
putting
the
knives
into
the
machine
it
is
highly
necessary
that
they
be
first
washed
in
a
little
warm
not
hot
water
and
then
thoroughly
wiped
if
put
into
the
machine
with
any
grease
on
them
it
adheres
to
the
brushes
and
consequently
renders
them
unfit
to
use
for
the
next
knives
that
may
be
put
in
when
this
precaution
is
not
taken
the
machine
must
come
to
pieces
so
causing
an
immense
amount
of
trouble
which
may
all
be
avoided
by
having
the
knives
thoroughly
free
from
grease
before
using
the
machine
brushes
are
also
used
for
cleaning
forks
which
facilitate
the
operation
when
knives
are
so
cleaned
see
that
they
are
carefully
polished
wiped
and
with
a
good
edge
the
ferules
and
prongs
free
from
dirt
and
place
them
in
the
basket
with
the
handles
all
one
way
requires
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
mechanism
after
that
constant
attention
to
cleanliness
and
an
occasional
entire
clearing
out
with
hot
water
when
this
is
done
all
the
parts
should
be
carefully
dried
before
filling
again
with
oil
when
lacquered
wipe
the
lacquered
parts
with
a
soft
brush
and
cloth
and
wash
occasionally
with
weak
soapsuds
wiping
carefully
afterwards
brass
lamps
may
be
cleaned
with
oil
and
rottenstone
every
day
when
trimmed
with

will
be
required
and

let
the
wick
be
cut
evenly
all
round
as
if
left
higher
in
one
place
than
it
is
in
another
it
will
cause
it
to
smoke
and
burn
badly
the

should
then
be
filled
with
oil
from
a
feeder
and
afterwards
well
wiped
with
a

kept
for
the

to
use
for
cleaning
the
glasses
inside
and
a
clean
duster
for
polishing
the

the

polish
so

rather
by

brushing
clothes
is
a
very
simple
but
very
necessary
operation
fine
cloths
require
to
be
brushed
lightly
and
with
rather
a
soft
brush
except
where
mud
is
to
be
removed
when
a
hard
one
is
necessary
being
previously
beaten
lightly
to
dislodge
the
dirt
lay
the
garment
on
a
table
and
brush
it
in
the
direction
of
the
nap
having
brushed
it
properly
turn
the
sleeves
back
to
the
collar
so
that
the
folds
may
come
at
the
next
turn
the
lappels
or
sides
back
over
the
folded
sleeves
then
lay
the
skirts
over
level
with
the
collar
so
that
the
crease
may
fall
about
the
centre
and
double
one
half
over
the
other
so
as
the
fold
comes
in
the
centre
of
the
back
having
got
through
his
dirty
work
the
single
footman
has
now
to
clean
himself
and
prepare
the
breakfast
he
lays
the
cloth
on
the
table
over
it
the
and
sets
the
breakfast
things
in
order
and
then
proceeds
to
wait
upon
his
master
if
he
has
any
of
the
duties
of
a
valet
to
perform

a

is
not
kept

portion
of
his
duties
falls
to
the
footman
share
brushing
the
clothes
among
others
when
the
hat
is
silk
it
requires
brushing
every
day
with
a
soft
brush
after
rain
it
requires
wiping
the
way
of
the
nap
before
drying
and
when
nearly
dry

the
soft

and
with
the
in

the
footman
is

will
have
to

lights
a

will
be
the
footman

to
restore
everything
to
its
place
properly
cleansed

dry
and
the
whole
restored
to

when
there
is

laying
it
on
the
table
again
making
up
the
fire
and
sweeping
up
the
hearth
at
nearly
the
same
routine
is
observed
except
where
the
footman
is
either
out
with
the
carriage
or
away
on
other
business
when
in
the
absence
of
any
butler
the
housemaid
must
assist
for
dinner
the
footman
lays
the
cloth
taking
care
that
the
table
is
not
too
near
the
fire
if
there
is
one
and
that
is
left
a
tablecloth
should
be
laid
without
a
wrinkle
and
this
requires
two
persons
over
this
the
slips
are
laid
which
are
usually
removed
preparatory
to
placing
dessert
on
the
table
he
prepares
knives
forks
and
glasses
with
five
or
six
plates
for
each
person
this
done
he
places
chairs
enough
for
the
party
distributing
them
equally
on
each
side
of
the
table
and
opposite
to
each
a
napkin
neatly
folded
within
it
a
piece
of
bread
or
small
roll
and
a
knife
on
the
right
side
of
each
plate
a
fork
on
the
left
and
a
and
fork
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
table
outside
the
others
with
the
rests
opposite
to
them
and
a
beside
the
knife
the
should
be
at
the
top
where
the
lady
of
the
house
with
the
assistance
of
the
gentleman
next
to
her
divides
the
fish
and
the
at
the
bottom
it
is
sometimes
usual
to
add
a
and
fork
at
the
same
time
on
the
right
side
also
of
each
plate
put
a
for
as
many
kinds
of
wine
as
it
is
intended
to
hand
round
and
a
or
about
four
inches
from
the
edge
the
latter
are
frequently
put
on
the
table
with
the
dessert
about
half
an
hour
before
dinner
he
rings
the
where
that
is
the
practice
and
occupies
himself
with
carrying
up
everything
he
is
likely
to
require
at
the
expiration
of
the
time
having
communicated
with
the
cook
he
rings
the
real
and
proceeds
to
take
it
up
with
such
assistance
as
he
can
obtain
having
ascertained
that
all
is
in
order
that
his
own
dress
is
clean
and
presentable
and
his
white
cotton
gloves
are
without
a
stain
he
announces
in
the
that
dinner
is
served
and
stands
respectfully
by
the
door
until
the
company
are
seated
he
places
himself
on
the
left
behind
his
master
who
is
to
distribute
the
soup
where
soup
and
fish
are
served
together
his
place
will
be
at
his
mistress
left
hand
but
he
must
be
on
the
alert
to
see
that
whoever
is
assisting
him
whether
male
or
female
are
at
their
posts
if
any
of
the
guests
has
brought
his
own
servant
with
him
his
place
is
behind
his
master
chair
rendering
such
assistance
to
others
as
he
can
while
attending
to
his
master
wants
throughout
the
dinner
so
that
every
guest
has
what
he
requires
this
necessitates
both
activity
and
intelligence
and
should
be
done
without
bustle
without
asking
any
questions
except
where
it
is
the
custom
of
the
house
to
hand
round
dishes
or
wine
when
it
will
be
necessary
to
mention
in
a
quiet
and
unobtrusive
manner
the
dish
or
wine
you
present
should
be
placed
on
the
table
in
number
sufficient
for
the
guests
so
that
each
may
help
themselves
or
at
least
their
immediate
neighbours
dinners
à
la
russe
in
some
houses
the
table
is
laid
out
with
plate
and
glass
and
ornamented
with
flowers
the
dessert
only
being
placed
on
the
table
the
dinner
itself
being
placed
on
the
sideboard
and
handed
round
in
succession
in
courses
of
soup
fish
entries
meat
game
and
sweets
this
is
not
only
elegant
but
economical
as
fewer
dishes
are
required
the
symmetry
of
the
table
being
made
up
with
the
ornaments
and
dessert
the
various
dishes
are
also
handed
round
when
hot
but
it
involves
additional
and
superior
attendance
as
the
wines
are
also
handed
round
and
unless
the
servants
are
very
active
and
intelligent
many
blunders
are
likely
to
be
made
see
p
general
observations
while
attentive
to
all
the
footman
should
be
obtrusive
to
none
he
should
give
nothing
but
on
a
waiter
and
always
hand
it
with
the
left
hand
and
on
the
left
side
of
the
person
he
serves
and
hold
it
so
that
the
guest
may
take
it
with
ease
in
lifting
dishes
from
the
table
he
should
use
both
hands
and
remove
them
with
care
so
that
nothing
is
spilt
on
the
or
on
the
dresses
of
the
guests
masters
as
well
as
servants
sometimes
make
mistakes
but
it
is
not
expected
that
a
servant
will
correct
any
omissions
even
if
he
should
have
time
to
notice
them
although
with
the
best
intentions
thus
it
would
not
be
correct
for
instance
if
he
observed
that
his
master
took
wine
with
the
ladies
all
round
as
some
gentlemen
still
continue
to
do
but
stopped
at
some
one
to
nudge
him
on
the
shoulder
and
say
as
was
done
by
the
servant
of
a
scottish
gentleman
what
ails
you
at
her
in
the
green
gown
it
will
be
better
to
leave
the
lady
unnoticed
than
for
the
servant
thus
to
turn
his
master
into
ridicule
during
dinner
each
person
knife
fork
plate
and
spoon
should
be
changed
as
soon
as
he
has
done
with
it
the
vegetables
and
sauces
belonging
to
the
different
dishes
presented
without
remark
to
the
guests
and
the
footman
should
tread
lightly
in
moving
round
and
if
possible
should
bear
in
mind
if
there
is
a
wit
or
humorist
of
the
party
whose
good
things
keep
the
table
in
a
roar
that
they
are
not
expected
to
reach
his
ears
in
opening
wine
let
it
be
done
quietly
and
without
shaking
the
bottle
if
crusted
let
it
be
inclined
to
the
crusted
side
and
decanted
while
in
that
position
in
opening
champagne
it
is
not
necessary
to
discharge
it
with
a
pop
properly
cooled
the
cork
is
easily
extracted
without
an
explosion
when
the
cork
is
out
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
should
be
wiped
with
the
napkin
over
the
footman
arm
at
the
end
of
the
first
course
notice
is
conveyed
to
the
cook
who
is
waiting
to
send
up

is
introduced
in
the

the

kept
has
many
of
the
duties
of
the
upper

to
perform
as
well
as
his

and
more
constant
occupation
he
will
also
have
the
arrangement
of

his

control

he
will
do
well
to
reduce
it
to
a
methodical

you
ken
a
aboot
it
and
needna
stop
to
open
and
read
it
but
just
take
it
at
once
probably
most
of
the
notes
you
are
expected
to
carry
might
with
equal
harmlessness
be
communicated
to
you
but
it
will
be
better
not
to
take
so
lively
an
interest
in
your
affairs
politeness
and
civility
to
visitors
is
one
of
the
things
masters
and
mistresses
have
a
right
to
expect
and
should
exact
rigorously
when
visitors
present
themselves
the

open
it
promptly
and
answer
without
hesitation
if
the

are
not
at
home
or
engaged

generally
means
the
same
thing
and
might
be
oftener
used
with
advantage
to
morals
on
the
contrary

he
has
no
such
orders

will
answer
affirmatively

is
too
dark
and
intimate
civilly
that
he
goes
to
inform
his

is
in
her
he
announces
the
name
of
the
visitors
having
previously
acquainted
himself
with
it
in
this
part
of
his
duty
it
is
necessary
to
be
very
careful
to
repeat
the
names
correctly
mispronouncing
names
is
very
apt
to
give
offence
and
leads
sometimes
to
other
disagreeables
the

initiated
into
some
of

took
an
interest
before
he
could
correct

mistake
made
by

him
when
the

departing
the

should
be
at

he
should

with
a
respectful
manner
and
close
it
gently
when
the
visitors
are
fairly
beyond
the
threshold
when
several
visitors
arrive
together
he
should
take
care
not
to
mix
up
the
different
names
together
where
they
belong
to
the
same
family
as
and
miss
if
they
are
strangers
he
should
announce
each
as
distinctly
as
possible
and
evening
the
being
prepared
the
laid
out
with
cards
and
counters
and
such
other
arrangements
as
are
necessary
made
for
the
reception
of
the
company
the
rooms
should
be
lighted
up
as
the
hour
appointed
approaches
attendants
in
the
even
more
than
in
the
should
move
about
actively
but
noiselessly
no
creaking
of
shoes
which
is
an
abomination
watching
the
lights
from
time
to
time
so
as
to
keep
up
their
brilliancy
but
even
if
the
attendant
likes
a
game
of
cribbage
or
whist
himself
he
must
not
interfere
in
his
master
or
mistress
game
nor
even
seem
to
take
an
interest
in
it
we
once
knew
a
lady
who
had
a
footman
and
both
were
fond
of
a
game
of
cribbage
john
in
the
kitchen
the
lady
in
her
the
lady
was
a
giver
of
evening
parties
where
she
frequently
enjoyed
her
favourite
amusement
while
handing
about
the
tea
and
toast
john
could
not
always
suppress
his
disgust
at
her
mistakes
there
is
more
in
that
hand
he
has
been
known
to
say
or
you
forgot
to
count
his
nob
in
fact
he
identified
himself
with
his
mistress
game
and
would
have
lost
twenty
places
rather
than
witness
a
miscount
it
is
not
necessary
to
adopt
his
example
on
this
point
although
john
had
many
qualities
a
good
servant
might
copy
with
advantage
the
coachhouse
and
stables
the
horse
is
the
noblest
of
quadrupeds
whether
we
view
him
in
his
strength
his
sagacity
or
his
beauty
he
is
also
the
most
useful
to
man
of
all
the
animal
creation
but
his
delicacy
is
equal
to
his
power
and
usefulness
no
other
animal
probably
is
so
dependent
on
man
in
the
state
of
domestication
to
which
he
has
been
reduced
or
deteriorates
so
rapidly
under
exposure
bad
feeding
or
bad
grooming
it
is
therefore
a
point
of
humanity
not
to
speak
of
its
obvious
impolicy
for
the
owner
of
horses
to
overlook
any
neglect
in
their
feeding
or
grooming
his
interest
dictates
that
so
valuable
an
animal
should
be
well
housed
well
fed
and
well
groomed
and
he
will
do
well
to
acquire
so
much
of
stable
lore
as
will
enable
him
to
judge
of
these
points
himself
in
a
general
way
where
a
horse
coat
is
habitually
rough
and
untidy
there
is
a
sad
want
of
in
the
stable
when
a
horse
of
tolerable
breeding
is
dull
and
spiritless
he
is
getting
ill
or
badly
fed
and
where
he
is
observed
to
perspire
much
in
the
stables
is
overfed
and
probably
eats
his
litter
in
addition
to
his
regular
supply
of
food
the
architectural
form
of
the
stables
will
be
subject
to
other
influences
than
ours
we
confine
ourselves
therefore
to
their
internal
arrangements
they
should
be
roomy
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
stalls
warm
with
good
ventilation
and
perfectly
free
from
cold
draughts
the
stalls
roomy
without
excess
with
good
and
drainage
so
as
to
exclude
bad
smells
a
sound
ceiling
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
dust
from
the
hayloft
which
is
usually
above
them
and
there
should
be
plenty
of
light
coming
however
either
from
above
or
behind
so
as
not
to
glare
in
the
horse
eye
the
first
of
these
objects
is
attained
if
the
stables
are
kept
within
a
degree
or
two
of
in
winter
and
in
summer
although
some
grooms
insist
on
a
much
higher
temperature
in
the
interests
of
their
own
labour
is
usually
attained
by
the
insertion
of
one
or
more
tubes
or
boxes
of
wood
or
iron
through
the
ceiling
and
the
roof
with
a
sloping
covering
over
the
opening
to
keep
out
rain
and
valves
or
ventilators
below
to
regulate
the
atmosphere
with
openings
in
the
walls
for
the
admission
of
fresh
air
this
is
still
a
difficulty
however
for
the
effluvium
of
the
stable
is
difficult
to
dispel
and
draughts
must
be
avoided
this
is
sometimes
accomplished
by
means
of
hollow
walls
with
gratings
at
the
bottom
outside
for
the
exit
of
bad
air
which
is
carried
down
through
the
hollow
walls
and
discharged
at
the
bottom
while
for
the
admission
of
fresh
air
the
reverse
takes
place
the
fresh
by
this
means
gets
diffused
and
heated
before
it
is
discharged
into
the
stable
should
be
divided
by
partitions
of
eight
or
nine
feet
high
at
the
head
and
six
at
the
heels
and
nine
feet
deep
so
as
to
separate
each
horse
from
its
neighbour
a
placed
within
easy
reach
of
the
horse
of
wood
or
iron
occupies
either
a
corner
or
the
whole
breadth
of
the
stall
which
should
be
about
six
feet
for
on

a
manger
formerly
of
wood
but
of
late
years
more
generally
of
iron
lined
with
enamel
occupies
a
corner
of
the
stall
the
pavement
of
the
stall
should
be
nearly
level
with
a
slight
incline
towards
the
gutter
to
keep
the
bed
dry
paved
with
hard
dutch
brick
laid
on
edge
or
asphalte
or
smithy
clinkers
or
laid
in
strong
cement
in
the
centre
about
five
feet
from
the
wall
a
grating
should
be
firmly
fixed
in
the
pavement
and
in
communication
with
a
drain
to
carry
off
the
water
the
gutter
outside
the
stall
should
also
communicate
with
the
drains
by
trapped
openings
the
passage
between
the
stall
and
the
hall
should
be
from
five
to
six
feet
broad
at
least
on
the
wall
opposite
to
each
stall
pegs
should
be
placed
for
receiving
the
harness
and
other
things
in
daily
use
is
indispensable
to
every
stable
it
should
be
dry
and
airy
and
furnished
with
a
fireplace
and
boiler
both
for
the
protection
of
the
harness
and
to
prepare
mashes
for
the
horses
when
required
the
should
be
boarded
where
the
harness
goes
with
pegs
to
hang
the
various
pieces
of

on

there
should
be
accommodation
for
the

sometimes
occur
and
he
should
be
at

to
interfere

of
the

and
we
have
in
view
will
consist
of
coachman
groom
and
who
are
capable
of
keeping
in
perfect
order
four
horses
and
perhaps
the
pony
of
this
establishment
the
coachman
is
chief
besides
skill
in
driving
he
should
possess
a
good
general
knowledge
of
horses
he
has
usually
to
purchase
provender
to
see
that
the
horses
are
regularly
fed
and
properly
groomed
watch
over
their
condition
apply
simple
remedies
to
trifling
ailments
in
the
animals
under
his
charge
and
report
where
he
observes
symptoms
of
more
serious
ones
which
he
does
not
understand
he
has
either
to
clean
the
carriage
himself
or
see
that
the
does
it
properly
first
duties
are
to
keep
his
horses
in
condition
but
he
is
sometimes
expected
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
valet
to
ride
out
with
his
master
on
occasions
to
wait
at
table
and
otherwise
assist
in
the
house
in
these
cases
he
should
have
the
means
of
dressing
himself
and
keeping
his
clothes
entirely
away
from
the
stables
in
the
morning
about
six
or
rather
before
the
stables
should
be
opened
and
cleaned
out
and
the
horses
fed
first
by
cleaning
the
rack
and
throwing
in
fresh
hay
putting
it
lightly
in
the
rack
that
the
horses
may
get
it
out
easily
a
short
time
afterwards
their
usual
morning
feed
of
oats
should
be
put
into
the
manger
while
this
is
going
on
the
has
been
removing
the
and
sweeping
and
washing
out
the
stables
both
of
which
should
be
done
every
day
and
every
corner
carefully
swept
in
order
to
keep
the
stable
sweet
and
clean
the
real
duties
of
the
groom
follow
where
the
horses
are
not
taken
out
for
early
exercise
the
work
of
grooming
immediately
commences
having
tied
up
the
head
to
use
the
excellent
description
of
the
process
given
by
old
barrett
take
a
currycomb
and
curry
him
all
over
the
body
to
raise
the
dust
beginning
first
at
the
neck
holding
the
left
cheek
of
the
headstall
in
the
left
hand
and
curry
him
from
the
of
his
head
all
over
the
body
to
the
buttocks
down
to
the
point
of
the
hock
then
change
your
hands
and
curry
him
before
on
his
breast
and
laying
your
right
arm
over
his
back
join
your
right
side
to
his
left
and
curry
him
all
under
the
belly
near
the
and
so
all
over
from
the
knees
and
back
upwards
after
that
go
to
the
far
side
and
do
that
likewise
then
take
a
dead
horse
tail
or
failing
that
a
cotton
and
strike
that
away
which
the
currycomb
hath
raised
then
take
a
round
brush
made
of
bristles
with
a
leathern
handle
and
dress
him
all
over
both
head
body
and
legs
to
the
very
fetlocks
always
cleansing
the
brush
from
the
dust
by
rubbing
it
with
the
currycomb
in
the
process
as
well
as
brushing
it
must
be
applied
with
mildness
especially
with
horses
otherwise
the
tickling
irritates
them
much
the
brushing
is
succeeded
by
a
with
which
rub
him
all
over
again
very
hard
both
to
take
away
loose
hairs
and
lay
his
coat
then
wash
your
hands
in
fair
water
and
rub
him
all
over
while
they
are
wet
as
well
over
the
head
as
the
body
lastly
take
a
clean
cloth
and
rub
him
all
over
again
till
he
be
dry
then
take
another
and
rub
all
his
legs
exceeding
well
from
the
knees
and
hocks
downwards
to
his
hoofs
picking
and
dressing
them
very
carefully
about
the
fetlocks
so
as
to
remove
all
gravel
and
dust
which
will
sometimes
lie
in
the
bending
of
the
joints
in
addition
to
the
practice
of
this
old
writer
modern
grooms
add
wisping
which
usually
follows
brushing
the
best
wisp
is
made
from
a
hayband
untwisted
and
again
doubled
up
after
being
moistened
with
water
this
is
applied
to
every
part
of
the
body
as
the
brushing
had
been
by
changing
the
hands
taking
care
in
all
these
operations
to
carry
the
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
coat
stains
on
the
hair
are
removed
by
sponging
or
when
the
coat
is
very
dirty
by
the
the
whole
being
finished
off
by
a
linen
or
flannel
cloth
the
horsecloth
should
now
be
put
on
by
taking
the
cloth
in
both
hands
with
the
outside
next
you
and
with
your
right
hand
to
the
off
side
throw
it
over
his
back
placing
it
no
farther
back
than
will
leave
it
straight
and
level
which
will
be
about
a
foot
from
the
tail
put
the
roller
round
and
the
under
it
about
six
or
eight
inches
from
the
fore
legs
the
horse
head
is
now
loosened
he
is
turned
about
in
his
stall
to
have
his
head
and
ears
rubbed
and
brushed
over
every
part
including
throat
with
the
finishing
by
pulling
his
ears
which
all
horses
seem
to
enjoy
very
much
this
done
the
mane
and
foretop
should
be
combed
out
passing
a
wet
sponge
over
them
sponging
the
mane
on
both
sides
by
throwing
it
back
to
the
midriff
to
make
it
lie
smooth
the
horse
is
now
returned
to
his
headstall
his
tail
combed
out
cleaning
it
of
stains
with
a
wet
brush
or
sponge
trimming
both
tail
and
mane
and
forelock
when
necessary
smoothing
them
down
with
a
brush
on
which
a
little
oil
has
been
dropped
watering
usually
follows
dressing
but
some
horses
refuse
their
food
until
they
have
drunk
the
groom
should
not
therefore
lay
down
exclusive
rules
on
this
subject
but
study
the
temper
and
habits
of
his
horse
all
horses
not
in
work
require
at
least
two
hours
exercise
daily
and
in
exercising
them
a
good
groom
will
put
them
through
the
paces
to
which
they
have
been
trained
in
the
case
of
he
will
walk
trot
canter
and
gallop
them
in
order
to
keep
them
up
to
their
work
with
draught
horses
they
ought
to
be
kept
up
to
a
smart
walk
and
trot
must
depend
on
their
work
but
they
require
feeding
three
times
a
day
with
more
or
less
corn
each
time
according
to
their
work
in
the
fast
coaching
days
it
was
a
saying
among
proprietors
that
his
belly
was
the
measure
of
his
food
but
the
horse
appetite
is
not
to
be
taken
as
a
criterion
of
the
quantity
of
food
under
any
circumstances
horses
have
been
known
to
consume
lbs
of
hay
in
hours
whereas
lbs
to
lbs
is
the
utmost
which
should
have
been
given
croall
an
extensive
coach
proprietor
in
scotland
limited
his
horses
to
lbs
cut
straw
lbs
bruised
oats
and
lbs
bruised
beans
in
the
morning
and
noon
giving
them
at
night
lbs
of
the
following
lbs
steamed
potatoes
lbs
lbs
cut
straw
and
lbs
salt
mixed
up
together
under
this
the
horses
did
their
work
well
the
ordinary
measure
given
a
horse
is
a
peck
of
oats
about
lbs
to
the
bushel
twice
a
day
a
third
feed
and
a
of
hay
which
may
be
about
lbs
or
when
he
is
in
full
work
you
can
not
take
up
a
paper
without
having
the
question
put
do
you
bruise
your
oats
well
that
depends
on
circumstances
a
fresh
young
horse
can
bruise
its
own
oats
when
it
can
get
them
but
aged
horses
after
a
time
lose
the
power
of
masticating
and
bruising
them
and
bolt
them
whole
thus
much
impeding
the
work
of
digestion
for
an
old
horse
then
bruise
the
oats
for
a
young
one
it
does
no
harm
and
little
good
oats
should
be
bright
and
dry
and
not
too
new
where
they
are
new
sprinkle
them
with
salt
and
water
otherwise
they
overload
the
horse
stomach
chopped
straw
mixed
with
oats
in
the
proportion
of
a
third
of
straw
or
hay
is
a
good
food
for
horses
in
full
work
and
carrots
of
which
horses
are
remarkably
fond
have
a
perceptible
effect
in
a
short
time
on
the
gloss
of
the
coat
the
water
given
to
a
horse
merits
some
attention
it
should
not
be
too
cold
hard
water
is
not
to
be
recommended
stagnant
or
muddy
water
is
positively
injurious
river
water
is
the
best
for
all
purposes
and
anything
is
preferable
to
spring
water
which
should
be
exposed
to
the
sun
in
summer
for
an
hour
or
two
and
stirred
up
before
using
it
a
handful
of
oatmeal
thrown
into
the
pail
will
much
improve
its
quality
a
horse
should
not
be
sent
on
a
journey
or
any
other
hard
work
immediately
after
new
shoeing
the
stiffness
incidental
to
new
shoes
is
not
unlikely
to
bring
him
down
a
day
rest
with
reasonable
exercise
will
not
be
thrown
away
after
this
operation
on
reaching
home
very
hot
the
groom
should
walk
him
about
for
a
few
minutes
this
done
he
should
take
off
the
moisture
with
the
scraper
and
afterwards
wisp
him
over
with
a
handful
of
straw
and
a
flannel
cloth
if
the
cloth
is
dipped
in
some
spirit
all
the
better
he
should
wash
pick
and
wipe
dry
the
legs
and
feet
take
off
the
bridle
and
crupper
and
fasten
it
to
the
rack
then
the
girths
and
put
a
wisp
of
straw
under
the
saddle
when
sufficiently
cool
the
horse
should
have
some
hay
given
him
and
then
a
feed
of
oats
if
he
refuse
the
latter
offer
him
a
little
wet
bran
or
a
handful
of
oatmeal
in
tepid
water
when
he
has
been
fed
he
should
be
thoroughly
cleaned
and
his
put
on
and
if
very
much
harassed
with
fatigue
a
little
good
ale
or
wine
will
be
well
bestowed
on
a
valuable
horse
adding
plenty
of
fresh
litter
under
the
belly
every
time
a
horse
is
unbridled
the
bit
should
be
carefully
washed
and
dried
and
the
leather
wiped
to
keep
them
sweet
as
well
as
the
girths
and
saddle
the
latter
being
carefully
dried
and
beaten
with
a
switch
before
it
is
again
put
on
in
washing
a
horse
feet
after
a
day
work
the
master
should
insist
upon
the
legs
and
feet
being
washed
thoroughly
with
a
sponge
until
the
water
flows
over
them
and
then
rubbed
with
a
brush
till
quite
dry
if
not
carefully
preserved
very
soon
gets
a
shabby
tarnished
appearance
where
the
coachman
has
a
proper
and
sufficient
assistance
this
is
inexcusable
and
easily
prevented
the
should
have
a
wooden
lining
all
round
and
be
perfectly
dry
and
well
ventilated
around
the
walls
hooks
and
pegs
should
be
placed
for
the
several
pieces
of
harness
at
such
a
height
as
to
prevent
their
touching
the
ground
and
every
part
of
the
harness
should
have
its
peg
or
hook
one
for
the
halters
another
for
the
reins
and
others
for
snaffles
and
other
bits
and
and
either
a
wooden
horse
or
for
the
saddles
and
pads
all
these
parts
should
be
dry
clean
and
shining
this
is
only
to
be
done
by
careful
cleaning
and
polishing
and
the
use
of
several
requisite
pastes
the
metallic
parts
when
white
should
be
cleaned
by
a
soft
brush
and
the
copper
and
brass
parts

into
a
paste

made
by
melting

of
litharge
of
the
shops

has
been
pounded
up
with

and
dried
and
sifted
through
a
sieve
leaving
the
two
when
mixed
to
simmer
on
the
fire
stirring
them
continually
till
all
is
melted
when
it
is
a
little
cool
mix
this
with
lb
of
good
place
this
again
on
the
fire
and
stir
till
it
boils
anew
and
suffer
it
to
cool
when
cooled
a
little
add
distilled
turpentine
till
it
has
the
consistence
of
a
thickish
paste
scenting
it
with
any
essence
at
hand
thinning
it
when
necessary
from
time
to
time
by
adding
distilled
turpentine
when
the
leather
is
old
and
greasy
it
should
be
cleaned
before
applying
this
polish
with
a
brush
wetted
in
a
weak
solution
of
potass
and
water
washing
afterwards
with
soft
river
water
and
drying
thoroughly
if
the
leather
is
not
black
one
or
two
coats
of
black
ink
may
be
given
before
applying
the
polish
when
quite
dry
the
varnish
should
be
laid
on
with
a
soft
using
also
a
soft
brush
to
polish
the
leather
when
the
leather
is
very
old
it
may
be
softened
with
and
after
putting
on
the
ink
a
sponge
charged
with
distilled
turpentine
passed
over
to
scour
the
surface
of
the

which
should
be
polished
as
above
fawn
or
take
a
quart
of
skimmed
milk
pour
into
it
oz

sulphuric
acid

and
store
it
away
till

it
off

is
usually
purchased
at
the
shops
but
a

is
made
as
follows
melt
parts
of
grease
and
stir
into
it
mixing
it
thoroughly
and
smoothly
parts
of
fine

powder
and
store
away
in
a
tin
box
for
use
this
grease
is
used
in
the
mint
at
paris
and
is
highly
approved
in
an
endless
variety
of
shapes
and
names
are
continually
making
their
appearance
but
the
hackney
cab
or
clarence
seems
most
in
request
for
light
carriages
the
family
carriage
of
the
day
being
a
modified
form
of
the
clarence
adapted
for
family
use
the
carriage
is
a
valuable
piece
of
furniture
requiring
all
the
care
of
the
most
delicate
upholstery
with
the
additional
disadvantage
of
continual
exposure
to
the
weather
and
to
the
muddy
streets
it
requires
therefore
to
be
carefully
cleaned
before
putting
away
and
a
perfectly
dry
and
well
ventilated
for
the
swells
with
moisture
it
shrinks
also
with
heat
unless
the
timber
has
undergone
a
long
course
of
seasoning
it
should
also
have
a
dry
floor
a
boarded
one
being
recommended
it
must
be
removed
from
the
ammoniacal
influence
of
the
stables
from
open
drains
and
cesspools
and
other
gaseous
influences
likely
to
affect
the
paint
and
varnish
when
the
carriage
returns
home
it
should
be
carefully
washed
and
dried
and
that
if
possible
before
the
mud
has
time
to
dry
on
it
this
is
done
by
first
well
slushing
it
with
clean
water
so
as
to
wash
away
all
particles
of
sand
having
first
closed
the
sashes
to
avoid
wetting
the
linings
the
body
is
then
gone
carefully
over
with
a
soft
mop
using
plenty
of
clean
water
and
penetrating
into
every
corner
of
the
carved
work
so
that
not
an
atom
of
dirt
remains
the
body
of
the
carriage
is
then
raised
by
placing
the
jack
under
the
axletree
and
raising
it
so
that
the
wheel
turns
freely
this
is
now
thoroughly
washed
with
the
mop
until
the
dirt
is
removed
using
a
for
corners
where
the
mop
does
not
penetrate
every
particle
of
mud
and
sand
removed
by
the
mop
and
afterwards
with
a
wet
sponge
the
carriage
is
wiped
dry
and
as
soon
after
as
possible
the
varnish
is
carefully
polished
with
soft
leather
using
a
little
sweet
oil
for
the
leather
parts
and
even
for
the
panels
so
as
to
check
any
tendency
of
the
varnish
to
crack
stains
are
removed
by
rubbing
them
with
the
leather
and
sweet
oil
if
that
fails
a
little
tripoli
powder
mixed
with
the
oil
will
be
more
successful
in
preparing
the
carriage
for
use
the
whole
body
should
be
rubbed
over
with
a
clean
leather
and
carefully
polished
the
and
joints
oiled
the
plated
and
occasionally
cleaned
the
one
with
or
with
whiting
mixed
with
sweet
oil
and
leather
kept
for
the
purpose
the
other
with
rottenstone
mixed
with
a
little
oil
and
applied
without
too
much
rubbing
until
the
paste
is
removed
but
if
rubbed
every
day
with
the
leather
little
more
will
be
required
to
keep
it
untarnished
the
linings
require
careful
brushing
every
day
the
cushions
being
taken
out
and
beaten
and
the
glass
sashes
should
always
be
bright
and
clean
the
and
axletree
are
carefully
seen
to
and
greased
when
required
the
bolts
and
nuts
tightened
and
all
the
parts
likely
to
get
out
of
order
overhauled
these
duties
however
are
only
incidental
to
the
office
which
is
to
drive
and
much
of
the
enjoyment
of
those
in
the
carriage
depends
on
his
proficiency
in
his
art
much
also
of
the
wear
of
the
carriage
and
horses
he
should
have
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
construction
of
the
carriage
to
know
when
it
is
out
of
order
to
know
also
the
pace
at
which
he
can
go
over
the
road
he
has
under
him
without
risking
the
springs
and
without
shaking
those
he
is
driving
too
much
having
with
or
without
the
help
of
the
groom
or
put
his
horses
to
the
carriage
and
satisfied
himself
by
walking
round
them
that
everything
is
properly
arranged
the
coachman
proceeds
to
the
of
the
carriage
takes
the
reins
from
the
back
of
the
horses
where
they
were
thrown
buckles
them
together
and
placing
his
foot
on
the
step
ascends
to
his
box
having
his
horses
now
entirely
under
control
in
ordinary
circumstances
he
is
not
expected
to
descend
for
where
no
footman
accompanies
the
carriage
the
doors
are
usually
so
arranged
that
even
a
lady
may
let
herself
out
if
she
wishes
it
from
the
inside
the
coachman
duties
are
to
avoid
everything
approaching
an
accident
and
all
his
attention
is
required
to
guide
his
horses
the
pace
at
which
he
drives
will
depend
upon
his
orders
in
all
probability
a
moderate
pace
of
seven
or
eight
miles
an
hour
less
speed
is
injurious
to
the
horses
getting
them
into
lazy
and
sluggish
habits
for
it
is
wonderful
how
soon
these
are
acquired
by
some
horses
the
writer
was
once
employed
to
purchase
a
horse
for
a
country
friend
and
he
picked
a
very
handsome
gelding
out
of
collins
stables
which
seemed
to
answer
to
his
friend
wants
it
was
duly
committed
to
the
coachman
who
was
to
drive
it
after
some
very
successful
trials
in
harness
and
out
of
it
and
seemed
likely
to
give
great
satisfaction
after
a
time
the
friend
got
tired
of
his
carriage
and
gave
it
up
as
the
easiest
mode
of
getting
rid
of
the
horse
it
was
sent
up
to
the
writer
stables
a
present
only
twelve
months
had
elapsed
the
horse
was
as
handsome
as
ever
with
plenty
of
flesh
and
a
sleek
glossy
coat
and
he
was
thankfully
enough
received
but
on
trial
it
was
found
that
a
stupid
coachman
who
was
imbued
with
one
of
their
old
maxims
that
it
the
pace
that
kills
had
driven
the
horse
capable
of
doing
his
nine
miles
an
hour
with
ease
at
a
of
four
miles
or
four
and
a
half
and
now
no
persuasion
of
the
whip
could
get
more
out
of
him
after
many
unsuccessful
efforts
to
bring
him
back
to
his
pace
in
one
of
which
a
occurred
under
the
hands
of
a
professional
trainer
he
was
sent
to
the
hammer
and
sold
for
a
sum
that
did
not
pay
for
the
attempt
to
break
him
in
this
maxim
therefore
that
it
the
pace
that
kills
is
altogether
fallacious
in
the
moderate
sense
in
which
we
are
viewing
it
in
the
old
coaching
days
indeed
when
the
shrewsbury
wonder
drove
into
the
inn
yard
while
the
clock
was
striking
week
after
week
and
mouth
after
month
with
unerring
regularity
hours
to
a
hundred
and
miles
when
the
quicksilver
mail
was
timed
to
eleven
miles
an
hour
between
london
and
plymouth
with
a
fine
of
to
the
driver
if
behind
time
when
the
brighton
age
tool
and
horsed
by
the
late
stevenson
used
to
dash
round
the
square
as
the
fifth
hour
was
striking
having
stopped
at
the
house
while
his
servant
handed
a
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
sherry
to
his
passengers
then
the
pace
was
indeed
killing
but
the
truth
is
horses
that
are
driven
at
a
pace
lose
that
with
which
a
good
driver
can
inspire
them
and
they
are
left
to
do
their
work
by
mere
weight
and
muscle
therefore
unless
he
has
contrary
orders
a
good
driver
will
choose
a
smart
pace
but
not
enough
to
make
his
horses
perspire
on
level
roads
this
should
never
be
seen
in
choosing
his
horses
every
master
will
see
that
they
are
properly
paired
that
their
paces
are
about
equal
when
their
habits
differ
it
is
the
coachman
duty
to
discover
how
he
can
with
least
annoyance
to
the
horses
get
that
pace
out
of
them
some
horses
have
been
accustomed
to
be
driven
on
the
check
and
the
curb
irritates
them
others
with
harder
mouths
can
not
be
controlled
with
the
slight
leverage
this
affords
he
must
therefore
accommodate
the
horses
as
he
best
can
the
reins
should
always
be
held
so
that
the
horses
are
in
hand
but
he
is
a
very
bad
driver
who
always
drives
with
a
tight
rein
the
pain
to
the
horse
is
intolerable
and
causes
him
to
rear
and
plunge
and
finally
break
sway
if
he
can
he
is
also
a
bad
driver
when
the
reins
are
always
slack
the
horse
then
feels
abandoned
to
himself
he
is
neither
directed
nor
supported
and
if
no
accident
occurs
it
is
great
good
luck
the
true
coachman
hands
are
so
delicate
and
gentle
that
the
mere
weight
of
the
reins
is
felt
on
the
bit
and
the
directions
are
indicated
by
a
turn
of
the
wrist
rather
than
by
a
pull
the
horses
are
guided
and
encouraged
and
only
pulled
up
when
they
exceed
their
intended
pace
or
in
the
event
of
a
stumble
for
there
is
a
strong
though
gentle
hand
on
the
reins
in
the
hands
of
a
good
driver
and
with
cattle
is
there
more
as
a
precaution
than
a
tool
for
frequent
use
if
he
uses
it
it
is
to
encourage
by
stroking
the
flanks
except
indeed
he
has
to
punish
some
waywardness
of
temper
and
then
he
does
it
effectually
taking
care
however
that
it
is
done
on
the
flank
where
there
is
no
very
tender
part
never
on
the
crupper
in
driving
the
coachman
should
never
give
way
to
temper
how
often
do
we
see
horses
stumble
from
being
conducted
or
at
least
allowed
to
go
over
bad
ground
by
some
careless
driver
who
immediately
wreaks
that
vengeance
on
the
poor
horse
which
might
with
much
more
justice
be
applied
to
his
own
brutal
shoulders
the
whip
is
of
course
useful
and
even
necessary
but
should
be
rarely
used
except
to
encourage
and
excite
the
horses
duties
of
the
valet
on
the
no
man
is
a
hero
to
his
valet
saith
the
proverb
and
the
corollary
may
run
no
lady
is
a
heroine
to
her
maid
the
infirmities
of
humanity
are
perhaps
too
numerous
and
too
equally
distributed
to
stand
the
severe
microscopic
tests
which
attendants
on
the
person
have
opportunities
of
applying
the
valet
and
are
placed
near
the
persons
of
the
master
and
mistress
receiving
orders
only
from
them
dressing
them
accompanying
them
in
all
their
journeys
the
confidants
and
agents
of
their
most
unguarded
moments
of
their
most
secret
habits
and
of
course
subject
to
their
commands
even
to
their
caprices
they
themselves
being
subject
to
erring
judgment
aggravated
by
an
imperfect
education
all
that
can
be
expected
from
such
servants
is
polite
manners
modest
demeanour
and
a
respectful
reserve
which
are
indispensable
to
these
good
sense
good
temper
some
and
consideration
for
the
feelings
of
others
whether
above
or
below
them
in
the
social
scale
will
be
useful
qualifications
their
duty
leads
them
to
wait
on
those
who
are
from
sheer
wealth
station
and
education
more
polished
and
consequently
more
susceptible
of
annoyance
and
any
vulgar
familiarity
of
manner
is
opposed
to
all
their
notions
of
quiet
unobtrusive
manners
therefore
and
a
delicate
reserve
in
speaking
of
their
employers
either
in
praise
or
blame
is
as
essential
in
their
absence
as
good
manners
and
respectful
conduct
in
their
presence
some
of
the
duties
of
the
valet
we
have
just
hinted
at
in
treating
of
the
duties
of
the
footman
in
a
small
family
his
day
commences
by
seeing
that
his
master
is
in
order
that
the
housemaid
has
swept
and
dusted
it
properly
that
the
fire
is
lighted
and
burns
cheerfully
and
some
time
before
his
master
is
expected
he
will
do
well
to
throw
up
the
sash
to
admit
fresh
air
closing
it
however
in
time
to
recover
the
temperature
which
he
knows
his
master
prefers
it
is
now
his
duty
to
place
the
on
the
horse
before
the
fire
to
be
aired
properly
to
lay
the
trousers
intended
to
be
worn
carefully
brushed
and
cleaned
on
the
back
of
his
master
chair
while
the
coat
and
waistcoat
carefully
brushed
and
folded
and
the
collar
cleaned
are
laid
in
their
place
ready
to
put
on
when
required
all
the
articles
of
the
toilet
should
be
in
their
places
the
razors
properly
set
and
stropped
and
hot
water
ready
for
use
gentlemen
generally
prefer
performing
the
operation
of
shaving
themselves
but
a
valet
should
be
prepared
to
do
it
if
required
and
he
should
besides
be
a
good
hairdresser
shaving
over
he
has
to
brush
the
hair
beard
and
moustache
where
that
appendage
is
encouraged
arranging
the
whole
simply
and
gracefully
according
to
the
age
and
style
of
countenance
every
fortnight
or
three
weeks
at
the
utmost
the
hair
should
be
cut
and
the
points
of
the
whiskers
trimmed
as
often
as
required
a

away
in

gentlemen
are
sometimes
indifferent
as
to
their
clothes
and
appearance
it
is
the
valet
duty
in
this
case
where
his
master
permits
it
to
select
from
the
wardrobe
such
things
as
are
suitable
for
the
occasion
so
that
he
may
appear
with
scrupulous
neatness
and
cleanliness
that
his
linen
and
where
that
is
white
or
coloured
are
unsoiled
and
where
he
is
not
accustomed
to
change
them
every
day
that
the
cravat
is
turned
and
even
ironed
to
remove
the
crease
of
the
previous
fold
the
coat
collar
which
where
the
hair
is
oily
and
worn
long
is
apt
to
get
greasy
should
also
be
examined
a
careful
valet
will
correct
this
by
removing
the
spots
day
by
day
as
they
appear
first
by
moistening
the
with
a
little
rectified
spirits
of
wine
or
spirits
of
hartshorn
which
has
a
renovating
effect
and
the
smell
of
which
soon
disappears
the
grease
is
dissolved
and
removed
by
gentle
scraping
the
grease
removed
add
a
little
more
of
the
spirit
and
rub
with
a
piece
of
clean
cloth

adding
a
few
drops
more
rub
it
with
the
palm
of
the
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
grain
of
the
cloth
and
it
will
be
clean
and
glossy
as
the
rest
of
the
garment
polish
for
the
boots
is
an
important
matter
to
the
valet
and
not
always
to
be
obtained
good
by
purchase
never
so
good
perhaps
as
he
can
make
for
himself
after
the
following
recipes
take
of

treacle
each
sulphuric
acid
best
spoonfuls
best
vinegar
mix
the
and
treacle
well
in
an
earthen
jar
then
add
the
sulphuric
acid
continuing
to
stir
the
mixture
next
pour
in
the
oil
and
lastly
add
the
vinegar
stirring
it
in
by
degrees
until
thoroughly

sugar
and
copperas
when
all
is
dissolved

brandy
mixing
it

this
mixture
will
yield

lbs
of
a
very
superior
polishing
paste
for

and
shoes
it
is
perhaps
unnecessary
to
add
that
having
discharged
all
the
commissions
intrusted
to
him
by
his
master
such
as
conveying
notes
or
messages
to
friends
or
the
tradesmen
all
of
which
he
should
punctually
and
promptly
attend
to
it
is
his
duty
to
be
in
waiting
when
his
master
returns
home
to
dress
for
dinner
or
for
any
other
occasion
and
to
have
all
things
prepared
for
this
second
dressing
previous
to
this
he
brings
under
his
notice
the
cards
of
visitors
who
may
have
called
delivers
the
messages

have
received
for
him
and
otherwise
acquits
himself
of
the
morning
commissions
and
receives
his
orders
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
the
routine
of
his
evening
duty
is
to
have
the
and
study
where
there
is
a
separate
one
arranged
comfortably
for
his
master
the
fires
lighted
candles
prepared
and

in
their
place
and
aired
and
everything
in
order
that
is
required
for
his

comforts
female
domestics
duties
of
the
the
duties
of
a
are
more
numerous
and
perhaps
more
onerous
than
those
of
the
valet
for
while
the
latter
is
aided
by
the
tailor
the
hatter
the
and
the
perfumer
the
has
to
originate
many
parts
of
the
mistress
dress
herself
she
should
indeed
be
a
tolerably
expert
milliner
and
dressmaker
a
good
hairdresser
and
possess
some
chemical
knowledge
of
the
cosmetics
with
which
the
is
supplied
in
order
to
use
them
with
safety
and
effect
her
first
duty
in
the
morning
after
having
performed
her
own
toilet
is
to
examine
the
clothes
put
off
by
her
mistress
the
evening
before
either
to
put
them
away
or
to
see
that
they
are
all
in
order
to
put
on
again
during
the
winter
and
in
wet
weather
the
dresses
should
be
carefully
examined
and
the
mud
removed
dresses
of
tweed
and
other
woollen
materials
may
be
laid
out
on
a
table
and
brushed
all
over
but
in
general
even
in
woollen
fabrics
the
lightness
of
the
tissues
renders
brushing
unsuitable
to
dresses
and
it
is
better
to
remove
the
dust
from
the
folds
by
beating
them
lightly
with
a
handkerchief
or
thin
cloth
silk
dresses
should
never
be
brushed
but
rubbed
with
a
piece
of
merino
or
other
soft
material
of
a
similar
colour
kept
for
the
purpose
summer
dresses
of
barège
muslin
mohair
and
other
light
materials
simply
require
shaking
but
if
the
muslin
be
tumbled
it
must
be
ironed
afterwards
if
the
dresses
require
slight
repair
it
should
be
done
at
once
a
stitch
in
time
saves
nine
the
bonnet
should
be
dusted
with
a
light
feather
plume
in
order
to
remove
every
particle
of
dust
but
this
has
probably
been
done
as
it
ought
to
have
been
the
night
before
velvet
bonnets
and
other
velvet
articles
of
dress
should
be
cleaned
with
a
soft
brush
if
the
flowers
with
which
the
bonnet
is
decorated
have
been
crushed
or
displaced
or
the
leaves
tumbled
they
should
be
raised
and
readjusted
by
means
of
if
feathers
have
suffered
from
damp
they
should
be
held
near
the
fire
for
a
few
minutes
and
restored
to
their
natural
state
by
the
hand
or
a
soft
brush
or
of
a
lady
is
one
of
the
few
things
left
to
mark
her
station
and
requires
special
care
satin
boots
or
shoes
should
be
dusted
with
a
soft
brush
or
wiped
with
a
cloth
kid
or
varnished
leather
should
have
the
mud
wiped
off
with
a
sponge
charged
with
milk
which
preserves
its
softness
and
polish
the
following
is
also
an
excellent
polish
for
applying
to
ladies
boots
instead
of
blacking
them
mix
equal
proportions
of
vinegar
and
treacle
with
oz
of
when
all
the
ingredients
are
thoroughly
incorporated
rub
the
mixture
on
the
boots
with
the
palm
of
the
hand
and
put
them
in
a
cool
place
to
dry
ladies
blacking
which
may
be
purchased
in
and
bottles
is
also
very
much
used
for
patent
leather
and
kid
boots
particularly
when
they
are
a
little
worn
this
blacking
is
merely
applied
with
a
piece
of
sponge
and
the
boots
should
not
be
put
on
until
the
blacking
is
dry
und
hardened

preliminary
offices
performed

prepare
for

and

according
to
her

wishes
and
habits
the
details
of
dressing
we
need
not
touch
upon
every
lady
has
her
own
mode
of
doing
so
but
the
maid
should
move
about
quietly
perform
any
offices
about
her
mistress

adjust

prepared

a
manner
as
to
look
well
with
the
lessons
in
hairdressing
may
be
obtained
and
at
not
an
unreasonable
charge
if
a
can
afford
it
we
would
advise
her
to
initiate
herself
in
the
mysteries
of
hairdressing
before
entering
on
her
duties
if
a
mistress
finds
her
maid
handy
and
willing
to
learn
she
will
not
mind
the
expense
of
a
few
lessons
which
are
almost
necessary
as
the
fashion
and
mode
of
dressing
the
hair
is
so
continually
changing

should
be
kept
scrupulously
clean

washing
them
about
twice

the

our
further
remarks
on
dressing
must
be
confined
to
some
general
advice
in
putting
on
a
band
see
that
it
is
laid
quite
flat
and
is
drawn
tightly
round
the
waist
before
it
is
pinned
in
front
that
the
pin
is
a
strong
one
and
that
it
is
secured
to
the
stays
so
as
not
to
slip
up
or
down
or
crease
in
the
folds
arrange
the
folds
of
the
dress
over
the
crinoline
petticoats
if
the
dress
fastens
behind
put
a
small
pin
in
the
slit
to
prevent
it
from
opening
see
that
the
sleeves
fall
well
over
the
arms
if
it
is
finished
with
a
jacket
or
other
upper
dress
see
that
it
fits
smoothly
under
the
arms
pull
out
the
flounces
and
spread
out
the
petticoat
at
the
bottom
with
the
hands
so
that
it
falls
in
graceful
folds
in
arranging
the
petticoat
itself
a
careful
will
see
that
this
is
firmly
fastened
round
the
waist
where
sashes
are
worn
pin
the
bows
securely
on
the
inside
with
a
pin
so
as
not
to
be
visible
then
raise
the
bow
with
the
fingers
the
collar
is
arranged
and
carefully
adjusted
with
brooch
or
bow
in
the
centre
having
dressed
her
mistress
for
breakfast
and
breakfasted
herself
the
further
duties
of
the
will
depend
altogether
upon
the
habits
of
the
family
in
which
hardly
two
will
probably
agree
where
the
duties
are
entirely
confined
to
attendance
on
her
mistress
it
is
probable
that
the
bedroom
and
will
be
committed
to
her
care
that
the
housemaid
will
rarely
enter
except
for
the
weekly
or
other
periodical
cleaning
she
will
therefore
have
to
make
her
mistress
bed
and
keep
it
in
order
and
as
her
duties
are
light
and
easy
there
can
be
no
allowance
made
for
the
slightest
approach
to
uncleanliness
or
want
of
order
every
morning
immediately
after
her
mistress
has
left
it
and
while
breakfast
is
on
she
should
throw
the
bed
open
by
taking
off
the
clothes
open
the
windows
except
in
rainy
weather
and
leave
the
room
to
air
for
half
an
hour
after
breakfast
except
her
attendance
on
her
mistress
prevents
it
if
the
rooms
are
carpeted
she
should
sweep
them
carefully
having
previously
strewed
the
room
with
moist
dusting
every
table
and
chair
taking
care
to
penetrate
to
every
corner
and
moving
every
article
of
furniture
that
is
portable
this
done
satisfactorily
and
having
cleaned
the
polished
up
the
furniture
and
the
ornaments
and
made
the
glass
jug
and
basin
clean
and
bright
emptied
all
slops
emptied
the
and
filled
them
with
fresh
water
and
arranged
the
rooms
the
is
ready
for
the
mistress
when
she
thinks
proper
to
appear
the
thoroughly
in
order
the
same
thing
is
to
be
done
in
the
bedroom
in
which
she
will
probably
be

such

all

very
useful
in

it
again
in

it
may
be
washed

she

out
in
an
orderly
manner
each
class
of
garments
by
themselves
with
a
proper
list
of
which
she
retains
a
copy
on
its
return
it
is
still
more
necessary
to
examine
every
piece
separately
so
that
all
missing
buttons
be
supplied
and
only
the
articles
properly
washed
and
in
perfect
repair
passed
into
the
wardrobe
ladies
who
keep
a
for
their
own
persons
are
in
the
habit
of
paying
visits
to
their
friends
in
which
it
is
not
unusual
for
the
maid
to
accompany
them
at
all
events
it
is
her
duty
to
pack
the
trunks
and
this
requires
not
only
knowledge
but
some
practice
although
the
improved
trunks
and
portmanteaus
now
made
in
which
there
is
a
place
for
nearly
everything
render
this
more
simple
than
formerly
before
packing
let
the
trunks
be
thoroughly
well
cleaned
and
if
necessary
lined
with
paper
and
everything
intended
for
packing
laid
out
on
the
bed
or
chairs
so
that
it
may
be
seen
what
is
to
be
stowed
away
the
nicer
articles
of
dress
neatly
folded
in
clean
calico
wrappers
having
satisfied
herself
that
everything
wanted
is
laid
out
and
that
it
is
in
perfect
order
the
packing
is
commenced
by
disposing
of
the
most
bulky
articles
the
and
skirts
and
other
articles
requiring
room
leaving
the
smaller
articles
to
fill
up
finally
having
satisfied
herself
that
all
is
included
she
should
lock
and
cover
up
the
trunk
in
its
canvas
case
and
then
pack
her
own
box
if
she
is
to
accompany
her
mistress
on
reaching
the
house
the
will
be
shown
her
apartment
and
her
duties
here
are
what
they
were
at
home
she
will
arrange
her
mistress
things
and
learn
which
is
her
bell
in
order
to
go
to
her
when
she
rings
her
meals
will
be
taken
in
the
room
and
here
she
must
be
discreet
and
guarded
in
her
talk
to
any
one
of
her
mistress
or
her
concerns
her
only
occupation
here
will
be
attending
in
her
lady
room
keeping
her
things
in
order
and
making
her
rooms
comfortable
for
her
the
evening
duties
of
a
are
pretty
nearly
a
repetition
of
those
of
the
morning
she
is
in
attendance
when
her
mistress
retires
she
assists
her
to
undress
if
required
brushes
her
hair
and
renders
such
other
assistance
as
is
demanded
removes
all

care
that
the
fire
if
any
is
safe
before
she
retires
to
rest
herself
ironing
is
a
part
of
the
duties
of
a
and
she
should
be
able
to
do
it
in
the
most
perfect
manner
when
it
becomes
necessary
ironing
is
often
badly
done
from
inattention
to
a
few
very
simple
requirements
cleanliness
is
the
first
essential
the
the
fire
the
iron
and
the
should
all
be
perfectly
clean
it
will
not
be
necessary
here
to
enter
into
details
on
ironing
as
full
directions
are
given
in
the
duties
of
the
a
will
have
a
great
deal
of
to
do
such
as
light
evening
dresses
muslin
dresses
which
are
not
dirty
enough
to
be
washed
but
merely
require
smoothing
out
to
remove
the
creases
in
summer
particularly
an
iron
will
be
constantly
required
as
also
a
which
should
be
covered
with
a
nice
clean
piece
of
flannel
to
keep
muslin
dresses
in
order
they
almost
require
smoothing
out
every
time
they
are
worn
particularly
if
made
with
many
flounces
the
may
often
have
to
perform
little
services
for
her
mistress
which
require
care
such
as
restoring
the
colour
to
scorched
linen
the
following
recipe
is
we
believe
a
very
good
one
to
restore
whiteness
to
scorched
linen
pint
of
vinegar
oz
of
oz
of
dried
fowls
dung
oz
of
soap
the
juice
of
large
onions
boil
all
these
ingredients
together
to
the
consistency
of
paste
spread
the
composition
thickly
over
the
damaged
part
and
if
the
threads
be
not
actually
consumed
after
it
has
been
allowed
to
dry
on
and
the
place
has
subsequently
been
washed
once
or
twice
every
trace
of
scorching
will
disappear
feathers
and
require
the
constant
care
of
the
furs
and
feathers
not
in
constant
use
should
be
wrapped
up
in
linen
washed
in
lye
from
may
to
september
they
are
subject
to
being
made
the
depositary
of
the
they
should
be
looked
too
and
shaken
and
beaten
from
time
to
time
in
case
some
of
the
eggs
should
have
been
lodged
in
them
in
spite
of
every
precaution
laying
them
up
again
or
rather
folding
them
up
as
before
wrapping
them
in
brown
paper
which
is
itself
a
preservative
shawls
and
cloaks
which
would
be
damaged
by
such
close
folds
must
be
looked
to
and
aired
and
beaten
putting
them
away
dry
before
the
evening
preservatives
against
the
ravages
of
moths
place
pieces
of
camphor
russia
leather
or
anything
else
strongly
aromatic
in
the
drawers
or
boxes
where
furs
or
other
things
to
be
preserved
from
moths
are
kept
and
they
will
never
take
harm
are
generally
wrapped
up
in
cotton
and
kept
in
their
cases
but
they
are
subject
to
tarnish
from
exposure
to
the
air
and
require
cleaning
this
is
done
by
preparing
clean
using
fine
dip
any
article
of
gold
silver
gilt
or
precious
stones
into
this
lye
and
dry
them
by
brushing
with
a
brush
of
soft
badgers
hair
or
a
fine
sponge
afterwards
with
a
piece
of
fine
cloth
and
lastly
with
a
soft
leather
of
gold
or
silver
and
in
general
all
articles
of
jewellery
may
be
dressed
by
dipping
them
in
spirits
of
wine
warmed
in
a
marie
or
shallow
kettle
placed
over
a
slow
fire
or
the
valet
and
from
their
supposed
influence
with
their
master
and
mistress
are
exposed
to
some
temptations
to
which
other
servants
are
less
subjected
they
are
probably
in
communication
with
the
tradespeople
who
supply
articles
for
the
toilet
such
as
batters
tailors
dressmakers
and
perfumers
the
conduct
of
and
valet
to
these
people
should
be
civil
but
independent
making
reasonable
allowance
for
want
of
exact
punctuality
if
any
such
can
be
made
they
should
represent
any
inconvenience
respectfully
and
if
an
excuse
seems
unreasonable
put
the
matter
fairly
to
master
or
mistress
leaving
it
to
them
to
notice
it
further
if
they
think
it
necessary
no
expectations
of
a
personal
character
should
influence
them
one
way
or
the
other
it
would
be
acting
unreasonably
to
any
domestic
to
make
them
refuse
such
presents
as
tradespeople
choose
to
give
them
the
utmost
that
can
be
expected
is
that
they
should
not
influence
their
judgment
in
the
articles
supplied
that
they
should
represent
them
truly
to
master
or
mistress
without
fear
and
without
favour
civility
to
all
servility
to
none
is
a
good
maxim
for
every
one
deference
to
a
master
and
mistress
and
to
their
friends
and
visitors
is
one
of
the
implied
terms
of
their
engagement
and
this
deference
must
apply
even
to
what
may
be
considered
their
whims
a
servant
is
not
to
be
seated
or
wear
a
hat
in
the
house
in
his
master
or
mistress
presence
nor
offer
any
opinion
unless
asked
for
it
nor
even
to
say
good
night
or
good
morning
except
in
reply
to
that
salutation
to
preserve
cut
flowers
a
bouquet
of
flowers
may
be
preserved
alive
for
a
long
time
by
placing
them
in
a
glass
or
vase
with
fresh
water
in
which
a
little
charcoal
has
been
steeped
or
a
small
piece
of
camphor
dissolved
the
vase
should
be
set
upon
a
plate
or
dish
and
covered
with
a
around
the
edges
of
which
when
it
comes
in
contact
with
the
plate
a
little
water
should
be
poured
to
exclude
the
air
to
revive
cut
flowers
after
packing
plunge
the
stems
into
boiling
water
and
by
the
time
the
water
is
cold
the
flowers
will
have
revived
then
cut
afresh
the
ends
of
the
stems
and
keep
them
in
fresh
cold
water
upper
and
under
housemaids
housemaids
in
large
establishments
have
usually
one
or
more
assistants
in
this
case
they
are
upper
and
under
housemaids
dividing
the
work
between
them
the
upper
housemaid
will
probably
reserve
for
herself
the
task
of
dusting
the
ornaments
and
cleaning
the
furniture
of
the
principal
apartments
but
it
is
her
duty
to
see
that
every
department
is
properly
attended
to
the
number
of
assistants
depends
on
the
number
in
the
family
as
well
as
on
the
style
in
which
the
establishment
is
kept
up
in
wealthy
families
it
is
not
unusual
for
every
daughter
to
have
her
whose
duty
it
is
to
keep
her
mistress
apartments
in
order
thus
abridging
the
duties
in
others
perhaps
one
attends
on
two
or
three
when
the
housemaid
assistance
will
be
more
requisite
in
fact
every
establishment
has
some
customs
peculiar
to
itself
on
which
we
need
not
dwell
the
general
duties
are
the
in
perfect
cleanliness
and
order
being
the
object
duties
of
the
housemaid
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
saith
the
proverb
and
order
is
in
the
next
degree
the
housemaid
then
may
be
said
to
be
the
handmaiden
to
two
of
the
most
prominent
virtues
her
duties
are
very
numerous
and
many
of
the
comforts
of
the
family
depend
on
their
performance
but
they
are
simple
and
easy
to
a
person
naturally
clean
and
orderly
and
desirous
of
giving
satisfaction
in
all
families
whatever
the
habits
of
the
master
and
mistress
servants
will
find
it
advantageous
to
rise
early
their
daily
work
will
thus
come
easy
to
them
if
they
rise
late
there
is
a
struggle
to
overtake
it
which
throws
an
air
of
haste
and
hurry
over
the
whole
establishment
where
the
master
time
is
regulated
by
early
business
or
professional
engagements
this
will
of
course
regulate
the
hours
of
the
servants
but
even
where
that
is
not
the
case
servants
will
find
great
personal
convenience
in
rising
early
and
getting
through
their
work
in
an
orderly
and
methodical
manner
the
housemaid
who
studies
her
own
ease
will
certainly
be
at
her
work
by
six
in
the
summer
and
probably
six
or
seven
in
the
winter
months
having
spent
a
reasonable
time
in
her
own
chamber
in
dressing
earlier
than
this
would
probably
be
an
unnecessary
waste
of
coals
and
candle
in
winter
the
first
duty
of
the
housemaid
in
winter
is
to
open
the
shutters
of
all
the
lower
rooms
in
the
house
and
take
up
the
of
those
rooms
which
she
is
going
to
do
before
breakfast
in
some
families
where
there
is
only
a
cook
and
housemaid
kept
and
where
the
are
large
the
cook
has
the
care
of
the
and
the
housemaid
that
of
the
library
and
after
the
shutters
are
all
opened
she
sweeps
the
sweeping
the
dust
towards
the
of
course
previously
removing
the
fonder
she
should
then
lay
a
cloth
generally
made
of
coarse
wrappering
over
the
carpet
in
front
of
the
stove
and
on
this
should
place
her
housemaid
box
containing
brushes
leathers
cloth
black
lead
and
all
utensils
necessary
for
cleaning
a
grate
with
the
on
the
other
side

she
now
sweeps
up
the
ashes
and
deposits
them
in
her
which
is
a
japanned
tin
pail
with
a
inside
and
a
top
in
this
pail
the
cinders
are
sifted
and
reserved
for
use
in
the
kitchen
or
under
the
copper
the
ashes
only
being
thrown
away
the
cinders
disposed
of
she
proceeds
to
the
grate
producing
the
black
lead
the
soft
brush
for
laying
it
on
her
blacking
and
polishing
brushes
from
the
box
which
contains
her
tools
this
housemaid
box
should
be
kept
well
stocked
having
blackened
brushed
and
polished
every
part
and
made
all
clean
and
bright
she
now
proceeds
to
lay
the
fire
sometimes
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
a
proper
polish
to
black
grates
particularly
if
they
have
been
neglected
and
allowed
to
rust
at
all
brunswick
black
which
is
an
excellent
varnish
for
grates
may
be
prepared
in
the
following
manner

housemaid
box
lb
of
common
asphaltum
pint
of
linseed
oil
quart
of
oil
of
turpentine
melt
the
asphaltum
and
add
gradually
to
it
the
other
two
ingredients
apply
this
with
a
small
painter
brush
and
leave
it
to
become
perfectly
dry
the
grate
will
need
no
other
cleaning
but
will
merely
require
dusting
every
day
and
occasionally
brushing
with
a
dry
brush
this
is
of
course
when
no
fires
are
used
when
they
are
required
the
bars
cheeks
and
back
of
the
grate
will
need
in
the
usual
manner
however
simple
is
an
operation
requiring
some
skill
a
fire
is
readily
made
by
laying
a
few
cinders
at
the
bottom
in
open
order
over
this
a
few
pieces
of
paper
and
over
that
again
eight
or
ten
pieces
of
dry
wood
over
the
wood
a
course
of
pieces
of
coal
taking
care
to
leave
hollow
spaces
between
for
air
at
the
centre
and
taking
care
to
lay
the
whole
well
back
in
the
grate
so
that
the
smoke
may
go
up
the
chimney
and
not
into
the
room
this
done
fire
the
paper
with
a
match
from
below
and
if
properly
laid
it
will
soon
burn
up
the
stream
of
flame
from
the
wood
and
paper
soon
communicating
to
the
coals
and
cinders
provided
there
is
plenty
of
air
at
the
centre
a
new
method
of
lighting
a
fire
is
sometimes
practised
with
advantage
the
fire
lighting
from
the
top
and
burning
down
in
place
of
being
lighted
and
burning
up
from
below
this
is
arranged
by
laying
the
coals
at
the
bottom
mixed
with
a
few
cinders
and
the
wood
at
the
top
with
another
layer
of
coals
and
some
paper
over
it
the
paper
is
lighted
in
the
usual
way
and
soon
burns
down
to
a
good
fire
with
some
economy
of
fuel
as
is
said
bright
grates
require
unceasing
attention
to
keep
them
in
perfect
order
a
day
should
never
pass
without
the
housemaid
rubbing
with
a
dry
leather
the
polished
parts
of
a
grate
as
also
the
fender
and
a
careful
and
attentive
housemaid
should
have
no
occasion
ever
to
use
for
any
part
but
the
bars
which
of
course
become
blackened
by
the
fire
some
mistresses
to
save
labour
have
a
double
set
of
bars
one
set
bright
for
the
summer
and
another
black
set
to
use
when
fires
are
in
requisition
when
bright
grates
are
once
neglected
small
begin
to
show
themselves
which
a
plain
leather
will
not
remove
the
following
method
of
cleaning
them
must
then
be
resorted
to
first
thoroughly
clean
with
then
take
a
large
smooth
pebble
from
the
road
sufficiently
large
to
hold
comfortably
in
the
hand
with
which
rub
the
steel
backwards
and
forwards
one
way
until
the
desired
polish
is
obtained
it
may
appear
at
first
to
scratch
but
continue
rubbing
and
the
result
will
be
success
the
following
is
also
an
excellent
polish
for
bright
stoves
and
steel
articles
tablespoonful
of
turpentine
ditto
of
sweet
oil
emery
powder
mix
the
turpentine
and
sweet
oil
together

in
sufficient
emery
powder
to
make
the
mixture
of
the
thickness
of
cream
put
it
on
the
article
with
a
piece
of
soft
flannel
rub
off
quickly
with
another
piece
then
polish
with
a
little
dry
emery
powder
and
clean
leather
the
several
fires
lighted
the
housemaid
proceeds
with
her
dusting
and
polishing
the
several
pieces
of
furniture
in
the
leaving
no
corner
unvisited

sweeping
the
carpet
it
is
a
good
practice
to
sprinkle
it
all
over

not
only
lay
all
dust
but
give
a
slightly
fragrant
smell

while
she
proceeds
to
prepare
the
breakfast
in
summer
the
housemaid
work
is
considerably
abridged
she
throws
open
the
windows
of
the
several
rooms
not
occupied
as
bedrooms
that
they
may
receive
the
fresh
morning
air
before
they

replaces
the
white
paper
or
arranges
the
shavings
with
which
it
is
filled
leaving
everything
clean
and
tidy
for
breakfast
it
is
not
enough
however
in
cleaning
furniture
just
to
pass
lightly
over
the
surface
the
rims
and
legs
of
tables
and
the
backs
and
legs
of
chairs
and
sofas
should
be
rubbed
vigorously
daily
if
there
is
a
every
corner
of
every
pane
and
ledge
requires
to
be
carefully
wiped
so
that
not
a
speck
of
dust
can
be
found
in
the
room
after
the
is
finished
the
housemaid
should
proceed
to
sweep
down
the
stairs
commencing
at
the
top
whilst
the
cook
has
the
charge
of
the
hall

passages
after
this
she
should
go
into
the
cover
up
every
article
of
furniture
that
is
likely
to
spoil

put
the
chairs
together

make
as
much
room
as
possible

she
sweeps

its
place

before
said

the

we
have
just
stated
putting
down
the
cloth
before
commencing
to
prevent
the
carpet
from
getting
soiled
in
the
country
a
room
would
not
require
sweeping
thoroughly
like
this
more
than
twice
a
week
but
the
housemaid
should
go
over
it
every
morning
with
a
and
broom
taking
up
every
crumb
and
piece
she
may
see
after
the
sweeping

opened
several
times
so
as
thoroughly
to
separate
the
feathers
if
too
large

the
maid
should
shake
and
beat
one
end
first
and
then
the
other
smoothing
it
afterwards
equally
all
over
into
the
required
shape
and
place
the
mattress
gently
over
it
any
feathers
which
escape
in

is

after

it
should
all
be

rubbed

for
this

the
housemaid
should
provide
herself
with
an
old

finish

long
as
modern
furniture
is
now
nearly
always
it

be

any

may

even
more
care

the
kind
known
as
they
require
to
be
swept

indeed
the
state
of
the
plate
is
a
certain
indication
of
a
or
household
nothing
is
easier
than
to
keep
plate
in
good
order
and
yet
many
servants
from
stupidity
and
ignorance
make
it
the
greatest
trouble
of
all
things
under
their
care
it
should
be
remembered
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
make
greasy
silver
take
a
polish
and
that
as
spoons
and
forks
in
daily
use
are
continually
in
contact
with
grease
they
must
require
good
washing
in
to
remove
it
silver
should
be
washed
with
a
soapy
flannel
in
one
water
rinsed
in
another
and
then
wiped
dry
with
a
dry
cloth
the
plate
so
washed
may
be
polished
with
the
as
in
the
following
directions
once
a
week
all
the
plate
should
receive
a
thorough
cleaning
with
the
hartshorn
powder
as
directed
in
the
first
recipe
for
cleaning
plate
and
where
the
housemaid
can
find
time
rubbed
every
day
with
the
hartshorn
we
may
observe
is
one
of
the
best
possible
ingredients
for
in
daily
use
it
leaves
on
the
silver
a
deep
dark
polish
and
at
the
same
time
does
less
injury
than
anything
else
it
has
also
the
advantage
of
being
very
cheap
almost
all
the
ordinary
powders
sold
in
boxes
containing
more
or
less
of
quicksilver
in
some
form
or
another
and
this
in
process
of
time
is
sure
to
make
the
plate
brittle
if
any
one
wishes
to
be
convinced
of
the
effect
of
quicksilver
on
plate
he
has
only
to
rub
a
little
of
it
on
one
place
for
some
time
on
the
handle
of
a
silver
teaspoon
for
instance
and
he
will
find
it
break
in
that
spot
with
very
little
pressure

clean

excellent

wash
the
plate
well
to

strong
lather

will

dry

soon
as
it
has
been
well
washed
and
dried
after
daily
use
a
most
beautiful
deep
polish
will
be
produced
and
the
plate
will
require
nothing
more
than
merely
to
be
dusted
with
a
leather
or
a
dry
soft
cloth
before
it
is
again

large
open
ones
dipping
and
falling
into
everything
on

being
very
much
in
the
way
she
should
not
wear
creaking
boots

should
move
about

noiselessly
as
possible

wants
by
handing

that

fragrant

impression
being
that
their

close
chamber

should
be

to
do
some

for

such
as

sheets
and
darning

or
assist
her
in
anything
she
may
think
fit
to

her
to

for
this
reason
it
is
almost
essential
that
a
housemaid
in
a
small
family
should
be
an
expert
needlewoman
as
if
she
be
a
good
manager
and
an
active
girl
she
will
have
time
on
her
hands
to
get
through
plenty
of
work
besides
the
daily
routine
which
we
have
described
there
are
portions
of
every
house
which
can
only
be
thoroughly
cleaned
occasionally
at
which
time
the
whole
house
usually
undergoes
a
more
thorough
cleaning
than
is
permitted
in
the
general
way
on
these
occasions
it
is
usual
to
begin
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
clean
downwards

everything
out
of
the
room

this
general
cleaning
usually
takes
place
in
the
spring

are
replaced

where
the
mistress
of

house
has
been
worried
into
an
experiment
by
the
question
why
beat
your
carpets
in
this
case
she
will
probably
have
made
up
her
mind
to
try
the
cleaning
process
and
arranged
with
the
company
to
send
for
them
on
the
morning
when
cleaning
commenced
it
is
hardly
necessary

repeat

on
this
occasion
every

is
to
be
gone

tear
it

gracefully
about

lower
part

her

a
solitary
one

in
some
places
her
work
is
never
done
she
is
also
subject
to
rougher
treatment
than
either

especially
in

starts
in

probably
a
girl
of
thirteen
with
some
small
tradesman
wife
as
her
mistress
just
a
step
above
her
in
the
social
scale
and
although
the
class
contains
among
them
many
excellent
women
it
also
contains
some
very
rough
specimens
of
the
feminine
gender
and
to
some
of
these
it
occasionally
falls
to
give
our
her
first
lessons
in
her
multifarious
occupations
the
mistress
commands
are
the
measure
of
the
duties
by
the
time
she
has
become
a
tolerable
servant
she
is
probably
engaged
in
some
respectable
tradesman
house
where
she
has
to
rise
with
the
lark
for
she
has
to
do
in
her
own
person
all
the
work
which
in
larger
establishments
is
performed
by
cook
and
housemaid
and
occasionally
the
part
of
a
duty
which
consists
in
carrying

the
general
servant
duties
commence
by
opening
the
shutters
and
windows
if
the
weather
permits
of
all
the
lower
apartments
in
the
house
she
should
then
brush
up
her
light
the
fire
clear
away
the
ashes
clean
the
hearth
and
polish
with
a
leather
the
bright
parts
of
the
range
doing
all
as
rapidly
and
as
vigorously
as
possible
that
no
more
time
be
wasted
than
is
necessary
after
putting
on
the
kettle
she
should
then
proceed
to
the
or
parlour
to
get
it
in
order
for
breakfast
she
should
first
roll
up
the
rug
take
up
the
fender
shake
and
fold
up
the
then
sweep
the
room
carrying
the
dirt
towards
the
fireplace
a
coarse
cloth
should
then
be
laid
down
over
the
carpet
and
she
should
proceed
to
clean
the
grate
having
all
her
utensils
close
to
her
when
the
grate
is
finished
the
ashes
cleared
away
the
hearth
cleaned
and
the
fender
put
back
in
its
place
she
must
dust
the
furniture
not
omitting
the
legs
of
the
tables
and
chairs
and
if
there
are
any
ornaments
or
things
on
the
sideboard
she
must
not
dust
round
them
but
lift
them
up
on
to
another
place
dust
well
where
they
have
been
standing

then
replace

things
nothing
annoys
a
particular
mistress
so
much
as
to
find
when
she
comes
down
stairs
different
articles
of
furniture
looking
as
if
they
had
never
been
dusted
if
the
servant
is
at
all
methodical
and
gets
into
a
habit
of
a
room
in
a
certain
way
she
will
scarcely
ever
leave
her
duties
neglected
after
the
rug
is
put
down
the
arranged
and
everything
in
order
she
should
lay
the
cloth
for
breakfast
and
then
shut
the
door
the
hall
must
now
be
swept
the
mats
shaken
the
cleaned
and
any
brass
knockers
or
handles
polished
up
with
the
leather

the

breakfast
very
early
the
tidying
of
the
hall
must
then
be
deferred
till
after
that
meal
after
cleaning
the
boots
that
are
absolutely
required
the
servant
should
now
wash
her
hands
and
face
put
on
a
clean
white
apron
and
be
ready
for
her
mistress
when
she
comes
down
stairs
in
families
where
there
is
much
work
to
do
before
breakfast
the
master
of
the
house
frequently
has
two
pairs
of
boots
in
wear
so
that
they
may
be
properly
cleaned
when
the
servant
has
more
time
to
do
them
in
the
daytime
this
arrangement
is
perhaps
scarcely
necessary
in
the
when
there
are
no
grates
to
clean
every
morning
but
in
the
dark
days
of
winter
it
is
only
kind
and

will
now
carry

the

cooks

send
it
to

clean
dish
and
nicely
garnished
with
tufts
of
parsley
if
this
is
obtainable
after
she
has
had
her
own
breakfast
and
whilst
the
family
are
finishing
theirs
she
should
go
upstairs
into
the
bedrooms
open
all
the
windows
strip
the
clothes
off
the
beds
and
leave
them
to
air
whilst
she
is
clearing
away
the
breakfast

she
should
then
take
up
the
crumbs
in
a
dustpan
from
under
the
table
put
the
chairs
in
their
places
and
sweep
up
the
hearth
the
breakfast
things
washed
up
the
kitchen
should
be
tidied
so
that
it
may
be
neat
when
her
mistress
comes
in
to
give
the
orders
for
the
day
after
receiving
these
orders
the
servant
should
go
upstairs
again
with
a
jug
of
boiling
water
the
and
two
cloths
after
emptying
the
slops
and
scalding
the
vessels
with
the
boiling
water
and
wiping
them
thoroughly
dry
she
should
wipe
the
top
of
the
and
arrange
it
all
in
order
she
then
proceeds
to
make
the
beds
in
which
occupation
she
is
generally
assisted
by
the
mistress
or
if
she
have
any
daughters
by
one
of
them
before
commencing
to
make
the
bed
the
servant
should
put
on
a
large
kept
for
this
purpose
only
which
should
be
made
very
wide
to
button
round
the
waist
and
meet
behind
while
it
should
be
made
as
long
as
the
dress

adopting
this
plan

at

when
the

are

should
be
dusted

the
lady
of
the
house
where
there
is
but

of
the

is
to
say
dusting
it
the
servant
sweeping
cleaning
windows
grates
and
rough
work
of
that
sort
if
there
are
many
ornaments
and
about
the
room
it
is
certainly
better
for
the
mistress
to
dust
these
herself
as
a
hands
are
not
always
in
a
condition
to
handle
delicate
ornaments
now
she
has
gone
the
rounds
of
the
house
and
seen
that
all
is
in
order
the
servant
goes
to
her
kitchen
to
see
about
the
cooking
of
the
dinner
in
which
very
often
her
mistress
will
assist
her
she
should
put
on
a
coarse
apron
with
a
bib
to
do
her
dirty
work
in
which
may
be
easily
replaced
by
a
white
one
if
required
half
an
hour
before
dinner
is
ready
she
should
lay
the
cloth
that
everything
may
be
in
readiness
when
she
is
dishing
up
the
dinner
and
take
all
into
the
that
is
likely
to
be
required
in
the
way
of
knives
forks
spoons
bread
salt
water
by
exercising
a
little
forethought
much
confusion
and
trouble
may
be
saved
both
to
mistress
and
servant
by
getting
everything
ready
for
the
dinner
in
good
time
after
taking
in
the
dinner
when
every
one
is
seated
she
removes
the
covers
hands
the
plates
round
and
pours
out
the
beer
and
should
be
careful
to
hand
everything
on
the
left
side
of
the
person
she
is
waiting
on
we
need
scarcely
say
that
a
can
not
stay
in
the
during
the
whole
of
as
she
must
dish
up
her
pudding
or
whatever
is
served
after
the
first
course
when
she
sees
every
one
helped
she
should
leave
the
room
to
make
her
preparations
for
the
next
course
and
anything
that
is
required
such
as
bread
people
may
assist
themselves
to
in
the
absence
of
the
servant
when
the
dinner
things
are
cleared
away
the
servant
should
sweep
up
the
crumbs
in
the
sweep
the
hearth
and
lightly
dust
the
furniture
then
sit
down
to
her
own
dinner
illustration
machine
after
this
she
washes
up
and
puts
away
the
dinner
things
sweeps
the
kitchen
dusts
and
tidies
it
and
puts
on
the
kettle
for
tea
she
should
now
before
dressing
herself
for
the
afternoon
clean
her
knives
boots
and
shoes
and
do
any
other
dirty
work
in
the
scullery
that
may
be
necessary
machines
are
rapidly
taking
the
place
in
most
households
of
the
old
the
saving
of
labour
by
the
is
very
great
and
its
performance
of
the
work
is
very
satisfactory
small
and
large
machines
are
manufactured
some
cleaning
only
four
knives
whilst
others
clean
as
many
as
twelve
at
once
nothing
can
be
more
simple
than
the
process
of
machine
and
although
in
a
very
limited
household
the
substitution
of
the
machine
for
the
board
may
not
be
necessary
yet
we
should
advise
all
housekeepers
to
whom
the
outlay
is
not
a
difficulty
to
avail
themselves
of
the
services
of
a
machine
we
have
already
spoken
of
its
management
in
the
duties
of
the
footman
no
when
the
servant
is
dressed
she
takes
in
the
tea
and
after
tea
turns
down
the
beds
sees
that
the
and
bottles
are
full
closes
the
windows
and
draws
down
the
blinds
if
the
weather
is
very
warm
these
are
usually
left
open
until
the
last
thing
at
night
to
cool
the
rooms
the
routine
of
a
general
servant
duties
depends
upon
the
kind
of
situation
she
occupies
but
a
systematic
should
so
contrive
to
divide
her
work
that
every
day
in
the
week
may
have
its
proper
share
by
this
means
she
is
able
to
keep
the
house
clean
with
less
fatigue
to
herself
than
if
she
left
all
the
cleaning
to
do
at
the
end
of
the
week
supposing
there
are
five
bedrooms
in
the
house
two
kitchen
scullery
and
the
usual
domestic
offices
on
monday
she
should
thoroughly
clean
the
on
tuesday
two
of
the
bedrooms
on
wednesday
two
more
on
thursday
the
other
bedroom
and
stairs
on
friday
morning
she
should
sweep
the
very
thoroughly
clean
the
hall
and
in
the
afternoon
her
kitchen
tins
and
bright
utensils
by
arranging
her
work
in
this
manner
no
undue
proportion
will
fall
to
saturday
share
and
she
will
then
have
this
day
for
cleaning
plate
cleaning
her
kitchen
and
arranging
everything
in
nice
order
the
regular
work
must
of
course
be
performed
in
the
usual
manner
as
we
have
endeavoured
to
describe
before
retiring
to
bed
she
will
do
well
to
clean
up
glasses
plates
which
have
been
used
for
the
evening
meal
and
prepare
for
her
morning
work
by
placing
her
wood
near
the
fire
on
the
hob
to
dry
taking
care
there
is
no
danger
of
it
igniting
before
she
leaves
the
kitchen
for
the
night
before
retiring
she
will
have
to
lock
and
bolt
the
doors
unless
the
master
undertakes
this
office
himself
if
the
washing
or
even
a
portion
of
it
is
done
at
home
it
will
be
impossible
for
the
to
do
her
household
duties
thoroughly
during
the
time
it
is
about
unless
she
have
some
assistance
usually
if
all
the
washing
is
done
at
home
the
mistress
hires
some
one
to
assist
at
the
and
sees
to
little
matters
herself
in
the
way
of
dusting
clearing
away
breakfast
things
folding
starching
and
ironing
the
fine
things
with
a
little
management
much
can
be
accomplished
provided
the
mistress
be
industrious
energetic
and
willing
to
lend
a
helping
hand
let
be
not
the
excuse
for
having
everything
in
a
muddle
and
although
things
can
not
be
cleaned
so
thoroughly
and
so
much
time
spent
upon
them
as
ordinarily
yet
the
house
may
be
kept
tidy
and
clear
from
litter
without
a
great
deal
of
exertion
either
on
the
part
of
the
mistress
or
servant
we
will
conclude
our
remarks
with
an
extract
from
an
book
called
home
truths
for
home
peace
the
authoress
says
with
respect
to
the
great
wash
amongst
all
the
occasions
in
which
it
is
most
difficult
and
glorious
to
keep
muddle
out
of
a
family
great
wash
stands
and
as
very
little
money
is
now
saved
by
having
done
at
home
many
ladies
with
the
option
of
taking
another
servant
or
putting
out
the
chief
part
of
the
washing
have
thankfully
adopted
the
latter
course
she
goes
on
to
say
when
a
gentleman
who
dines
at
home
ca
bear
washing
in
the
house
but
gladly
pays
for
its
being
done
elsewhere
the
lady
should
gratefully
submit
to
his
wishes
and
put
out
anything
in
her
whole
establishment
rather
than
put
out
a
good
and
generous
husband
a
bustling
and
active
girl
will
always
find
time
to
do
a
little
needlework
for
herself
if
she
lives
with
consistent
and
reasonable
people
in
the
summer
evenings
she
should
manage
to
sit
down
for
two
or
three
hours
and
for
a
short
time
in
the
afternoon
in
leisure
days
a
general
servant
duties
are
so
multifarious
that
unless
she
be
quick
and
active
she
will
not
be
able
to
accomplish
this
to
discharge
these
various
duties
properly
is
a
difficult
task
and
sometimes
a
thankless
office
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
good
will
make

parts
of

she
takes
her
share
in
the

in
private
families
the
milking
is
generally
performed
by
the
cowkeeper
and
the

cream
and
butter
and
other
luxuries
depending
on
the
milky
mothers
of
the
herd
the
object
with
which
gentlemen
keep
cows
is
to
procure
milk
unadulterated
and
sweet
butter
for
themselves
and
families
in
order
to
obtain
this
however
great
cleanliness
is
required
and
as
visitors
as
well
as
the
mistress
of
the
house
sometimes
visit
the
dairy
some
efforts
are
usually
made
to
render
it
ornamental
and
picturesque
the
locality
is
usually
fixed
near
to
the
house
it
should
neither
be
exposed
to
the
fierce
heat
of
the
summer
sun
nor
to
the
equally
unfavourable
frosts
of
winter
it
must
be
both
sheltered
and
shaded
if
it
is
a
building
apart
from
the
house
and
other
offices
the
walls
should
be
tolerably
thick
and
if
hollow
the
temperature
will
be
more
equable
the
walls
inside
are
usually
covered
with
dutch
glazed
tiles
the
flooring
also
of
glazed
tiles
set
in
asphalte
to
resist
water
and
the
ceiling
lath
and
plaster
or
woodwork
painted
its
architecture
will
be
a
matter
of
fancy
it
should
have
a
northern
aspect
and
a
thatched
roof
is
considered
most
suitable
from
the
shade
and
shelter
it
affords
and
it
should
contain
at

two
apartments

one
of
the
apartments
in

is
placed
to

to
ripen
for

is
usually
surrounded
by
shelves
of
marble
or
slate
on
which
the
rest
but
it
will
be
found
a
better
plan
to
have
a
large
square

round
table
of
stone
in
the
centre
with
a
ledge
all
round
it
in
which
water
may
remain
in
hot
weather
or
if
some
attempt
at
the
picturesque
is
desired
a
small
fountain
might
occupy
the

which
would
keep
the

be
found
a
better
plan
than
putting
them
on

there
should
be
a

with
blinds
fitted
into
the
opening
and
calico
blinds
which
may
be
wetted
when
additional
coolness
is
required
the

be
used
for

the
scullery
of
the

with
a
boiler
for

be
plentiful
and
good
in
some
dairies
a
third
apartment
or
at

a
cool

pantry
is
required
for
storing

of
an

is
fitted
to

the
act
of

is
done
by

after
which
it
is
skimmed
off
by
means
of
the
slicer
and
poured
into
glazed
earthenware
jars
to

for

some
persons
prefer
making
up
a
separate
churning
for
the
milk
of
each
cow
in
which
there
is
some
advantage
in
this
case
the
basins
of
each
cow
for
two
days
would
either
be
kept
together
or
labelled
as
soon
as
emptied
the
pails
should
be
scalded
and
every
particle
of
milk
washed
out
and
placed
away
in
a
dry
place
till
next
required
and
all
milk
spilt
on
the
floor
or
on
the
table
or
dresser
cleaned
up
with
a
cloth
and
hot
water
where
very
great
attention
is
paid
to
the
dairy
the
are
used
larger
in
winter
when
it
is
desirable
to
retard
the
cooling
down
and
increase
the
creamy
deposit
and
smaller
in
summer
to
hasten
it
the
temperature
required
being
from
to
in
summer
it
is
sometimes
expedient
in
very
sultry
weather
to
keep
the
dairy
fresh
and
cool
by
suspending
cloths
dipped
in
chloride
of
lime
across
the
room
in
some
dairies
it
is
usual
to
churn
twice
and
in
others
three
times
a
week
the
former
produces
the
best
butter
the
other
the
greatest
quantity
with
three
cows
the
produce
should
be
to
quarts
a
day
the
should
churn
every
day
when
very
hot
if
they
are
in
full
milk
and
every
second
day
in
more
temperate
weather
besides
supplying
the
milk
and
cream
required
for
a
large
establishment
the
churning
should
always
be
done
in
the
morning
the
will
find
it
advantageous
in
being
at
work
on
churning
mornings
by
five
the
operation
occupies
from
minutes
to
half
an
hour
in
summer
and
considerably
longer
in
winter
a
steady
uniform
motion
is
necessary
to
produce
sweet
butter
neither
too
quick
nor
too
slow
rapid
motion
causes
the
cream
to
heave
and
swell
from
too
much
air
being
forced
into
it
the
result
is
a
tedious
churning
and
soft
butter
in
spring
and
summer
when
the
cow
has
her
natural
food
no
artificial
colour
is
required
but
in
winter
under
the
colour
is
white
and
tallowy
and
some
persons
prefer
a
higher
colour
this
is
communicated
by
mixing
a
little
arnotto
with
the
cream
before
putting
it
into
the
churn
a
still
more
natural
and
delicate
colour
is
communicated
by
scraping
a
red
carrot
into
a
clean
piece
of
linen
cloth
dipping
it
into
water
and
squeezing
it
into
the
cream
as
soon
as
the
butter
comes
the
milk
is
poured
off
and
the
butter
put
into
a
shallow
wooden
tub
or
bowl
full
of
pure
spring
water
in
which
it
is
washed
and
kneaded
pouring
off
the
water
and
renewing
it
until
it
comes
away
perfectly
free
from
milk
imperfect
washing
is
the
frequent
cause
of
bad
butter
and
in
nothing
is
the
skill
of
the
tested
more
than
in
this
process
moreover
it
is
one
in
which
cleanliness
of
habits
and
person
are
most
necessary
in
this
operation
we
want
the
aid
of
phyllis
neat
soft
and
perfectly
clean
hand
for
no
mechanical
operation
can
so
well
squeeze
out
the
sour
particles
of
milk
or
curd
the
operations
of
churning
and
over
the
is
disposed
of
usually
in
england
it
goes
to
the
pigs
but
it
is
a
very
wholesome
beverage
when
fresh
and
some
persons
like
it
the
disposal
therefore
will
rest
with
the
mistress
the
duty
is
to
get
rid
of
it
she
must
then
scald
with
boiling
water
and
scrub
out
every
utensil
she
has
used
brush
out
the
churn
clean
out
the
which
will
probably
require
the
use
of
a
little
common
soda
to
purify
wipe
all
dry
and
place
them
in
a
position
where
the
sun
can
reach
them
for
a
short
time
to
sweeten
them
in
devonshire
celebrated
for
its
dairy
system
the
milk
is
always
scalded
the
which
are
of
tin
and
contain
from
to
quarts
after
standing
or
hours
are
placed
on
a
hot
plate
of
iron
over
a
stove
until
the
cream
has
formed
on
the
surface
which
is
indicated
by
the
rising
through
the
milk
and
producing
blisters
on
the
of
cream
this
indicates
its
approach
to
the
boiling
point
and
the
vessel
is
now
removed
to
cool
when
sufficiently
that
is
quite
cool
the
cream
is
skimmed
off
with
the
slice
it
is
now
the
clouted
cream
for
which
devonshire
is
so
famous
it
is
now
placed
in
the
churn
and
churned
until
the
butter
comes
which
it
generally
does
in
a
much
shorter
time
than
by
the
other
process
the
butter
so
made
contains
more
than
butter
made
in
the
usual
way
but
does
not
keep
so
long
it
is
a
question
frequently
discussed
how
far
it
is
economical
for
families
to
keep
cows
and
make
their
own
butter
it
is
calculated
that
a
good
cow
costs
from
may
to
october
when
well
but
economically
kept
and
from
october
to
april
during
that
time
she
should
produce
lbs
of
butter
besides
the
skimmed
milk
of
course
if
new
milk
and
cream
are
required
that
will
diminish
the
quantity
of
butter
besides
churning
and
keeping
her
dairy
in
order
the
has
charge
of
the
whole
produce
handing
it
over
to
the
cook
butler
or
housemaid
as
required
and
she
will
do
well
to
keep
an
exact
account
both
of
what
she
receives
and
how
and
when
she
disposes
of
it
duties
of
the
the
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
washing
and
the
family
linen
a
situation
of
great
importance
where
the
washing
is
all
done
at
home
but
in
large
towns
where
there
is
little
convenience
for
bleaching
and
drying
it
is
chiefly
done
by
professional
laundresses
and
companies
who
apply
mechanical
and
chemical
processes
to
the
purpose
these
processes
however
are
supposed
to
injure
the
fabric
of
the
linen
and
in
many
families
the
fine
linen
cottons
and
muslins
are
washed
and
at
home
even
where
the
bulk
of
the
washing
is
given
out
in
country
and
suburban
houses
where
greater
conveniences
exist
washing
at

and
by

the
mangling
process
which
is
simply
passing
them
between
rollers
subjected
to
a
very
considerable
pressure
produced
by
weight
is
confined
to
sheets

and
similar
articles
which
are
without

ironing
is
necessary
to
smooth
and
articles
of
delicate
texture
or
gathered
into
folds
the
mangle
is
too
well
known
to
need
description
the
irons
consist
of
the
common
which
is
of
different
sizes
varying
from
to
inches
in
length
triangular
in
form
and
from
to
inches
in
width
at
the
broad
end
the
oval
iron
which
is
used
for
more
delicate
articles
and
the
which
is
hollow
and
heated
by
a
iron
inserted
into
the
box
the
italian
iron
is
a
hollow
tube
smooth
on
the
outside
and
raised
on
a
slender
pedestal
with
a
footstalk
into
the
hollow
cylinder
a
iron
is
pushed
which
heats
it
and
the
smooth
outside
of
the
latter
is
used
on
which
articles
such
as
frills
and
plaited
articles
are
drawn
and
are
used
for
a
kind
of
plaiting
where
much
regularity
is
required
the
articles
being
passed
through
two
iron
rollers
fluted
so
as
to
represent
the
kind
of
plait
or
fold
required
starching
is
a
process
by
which
stiffness
is
communicated
to
certain
parts
of
linen
as
the
collar
and
front
of
shirts
by
dipping
them
in
a
paste
made
of
starch
boiled
in
water
mixed
with
a
little
gum
arabic
where
extra
stiffness
is
required
to
make
starch
allow
pint
of
cold
water
and
quart
of
boiling
water
to
every
tablespoonfuls
of
starch
put
the
starch
into
a
tolerably
large
basin
pour
over
it
the
cold
water
and
stir
the
mixture
well
with
a
wooden
spoon
until
it
is
perfectly
free
from
lumps
and
quite
smooth
then
take
the
basin
to
the
fire
and
whilst
the
water
is
in
the
kettle
or
boiler
pour
it
over
the
starch
stirring
it
the
whole
time
if
made
properly
in
this
manner
the
starch
will
require
no
further
boiling
but
should
the
water
not
be
boiling
when
added
to
the
starch
it
will
not
thicken
and
must
be
put
into
a
clean
saucepan
and
stirred
over
the
fire
until
it
boils
take
it
off
the
fire
strain
it
into
a
clean
basin
cover
it
up
to
prevent
a
skin
forming
on
the
top
and
when
sufficiently
cool
that
the
hand
may
be
borne
in
it
starch
the
things
many
persons
to
give
a
shiny
and
smooth
appearance
to
the
linen
when
ironed
stir
round
two
or
three
times
in
the
starch
a
piece
of
wax
candle
which
also
prevents
the
iron
from
sticking
when
the
things
to
be
starched
are
washed
dried
and
taken
off
the
lines
they
should
be
dipped
into
the
hot
starch
made
as
directed
squeezed
out
of
it
and
then
just
dipped
into
cold
water
and
immediately
squeezed
dry
if
fine
things
be
wrung
or
roughly
used
they
are
very
liable
to
tear
so
too
much
care
can
not
be
exercised
in
this
respect
if
the
article
is
lace
clap
it
between
the
hands
a
few
times
which
will
assist
to
clear
it
then
have
ready
laid
out
on
the
table
a
large
clean
towel
or
cloth
shake
out
the
starched
things
lay
them
on
the
cloth
and
roll
it
up
tightly
and
let
it
remain
for
three
or
fours
when
the
things
will
be
ready
to
iron
to
be
able
to
iron
properly
requires
much
practice
and
experience
strict
cleanliness
with
all
the
ironing
utensils
must
be
observed
as
if
this
is
not
the
case
not
the
most
expert
ironer
will
be
able
to
make
her
things
look
clear
and
free
from
smears
after
wiping
down
her
ironing
table
the
should
place
a
coarse
cloth
on
it
and
over
that
the
with
her
stand
and
and
having
ascertained
that
her
irons
are
quite
clean
and
of
the
right
heat
she
proceeds
with
her
work
it
is
a
good
plan
to
try
the
heat
of
the
iron
on
a
coarse
cloth
or
apron
before
ironing
anything
fine
there
is
then
no
danger
of
scorching
for
ironing
fine
things
such
as
collars
cuffs
muslins
and
laces
there
is
nothing
so
clean
and
nice
to
use
as
the
the
bottom
being
bright
and
never
placed
near
the
fire
it
is
always
perfectly
clean
it
should
however
be
kept
in
a
dry
place
for
fear
of
its
rusting
or
irons
must
be
placed
in
a
clear
fire
for
a
minute
then
withdrawn
wiped
with
a
coarse
rubber
and
the
heat
of
them
tried
on
a
piece
of
paper
as
unless
great
care
is
taken
these
will
very
soon
scorch
the
skirts
of
muslin
dresses
should
be
ironed
on
a
covered
with
flannel
and
the
fronts
of
shirts
on
a
smaller
board
also
covered
with
flannel
this
board
being
placed
between
the
back
and
front
after
things
are
mangled
they
should
also
be
ironed
in
the
folds
and
gathers
smoothed
over
as
also
and
sometimes
sheets
the
bands
of
flannel
petticoats
and
to
flannel
waistcoats
must
also
undergo
the
same
process
upper
and
under
nursemaids
the
nursery
is
of
great
importance
in
every
family
and
in
families
of
distinction
where
there
are
several
young
children
it
is
an
establishment
kept
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
family
under
the
charge
of
an
upper
nurse
assisted
by
under
proportioned
to
the
work
to
be
done
the
responsible
duties
of
upper
nursemaid
commence
with
the
weaning
of
the
child
it
must
now
be
separated
from
the
mother
or
at
least
for
a
time
and
the
cares
of
the
nursemaid
which
have
hitherto
been
only
occasionally
put
in
requisition
are
now
to
be
entirely
devoted
to
the
infant
she
washes
dresses
and
feeds
it
walks
out
with
it
and
regulates
all
its
little
wants
and
even
at
this
early
age
many
good
qualities
are
required
to
do
so
in
a
satisfactory
manner
patience
and
good
temper
are
indispensable
qualities
truthfulness
purity
of
manners
minute
cleanliness
and
docility
and
obedience
almost
equally
so
she
ought
also
to
be
acquainted
with
the
art
of
ironing
and
trimming
little
caps
and
be
handy
with
her
needle
there
is
a
considerable
art
in
carrying
an
infant
comfortably
for
itself
and
for
the
nursemaid
if
she
carry
it
always
seated
upright
on
her
arm
and
presses
it
too
closely
against
her
chest
the
stomach
of
the
child
is
apt
to
get
compressed
and
the
back
fatigued
for
her
own
comfort
a
good
nurse
will
frequently
vary
this
position
by
changing
from
one
arm
to
the
other
and
sometimes
by
laying
it
across
both
raising
the
head
a
little
when
teaching
it
to
walk
and
guiding
it
by
the
hand
she
should
change
the
hand
from
time
to
time
so
as
to
avoid
raising
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
this
is
the
only
way
in
which
a
child
should
be
taught
to
walk
and
other
foolish
inventions
which
force
an
infant
to
make
efforts
with
its
shoulders
and
head
forward
before
it
knows
how
to
use
its
limbs
will
only
render
it
feeble
and
retard
its
progress
most
children
have
some
bad
habit
of
which
they
must
be
broken
but
this
is
never
accomplished
by
harshness
without
developing
worse
evils
kindness
perseverance
and
patience
in
the
nurse
are
here
of
the
utmost
importance
when
is
one
of
these
habits
the
fingers
are
sometimes
rubbed
with
bitter
aloes
or
some
equally
disagreeable
substance
others
have
dirty
habits
which
are
only
to
be
changed
by
patience
perseverance
and
above
all
by
regularity
in
the
nurse
she
should
never
be
permitted
to
inflict
punishment
on
these
occasions
or
indeed
on
any
occasion
but
if
punishment
is
to
be
avoided
it
is
still
more
necessary
that
all
kinds
of
indulgences
and
flattery
be
equally
forbidden
yielding
to
all
the
whims
of
a
child
picking
up
its
toys
when
thrown
away
in
mere
wantonness
would
be
intolerable
a
child
should
never
be
led
to
think
others
inferior
to
it
to
beat
a
dog
or
even
the
stone
against
which
it
falls
as
some
children
are
taught
to
do
by
silly
nurses
neither
should
the
nurse
affect
or
show
alarm
at
any
of
the
little
accidents
which
must
inevitably
happen
if
it
falls
treat
it
as
a
trifle
otherwise
she
encourages
a
spirit
of
cowardice
and
timidity
but
she
will
take
care
that
such
accidents
are
not
of
frequent
occurrence
or
the
result
of
neglect
the
nurse
should
keep
the
child
as
clean
as
possible
and
particularly
she
should
train
it
to
habits
of
cleanliness
so
that
it
should
feel
uncomfortable
when
otherwise
watching
especially
that
it
does
not
soil
itself
in
eating
at
the
same
time
vanity
in
its
personal
appearance
is
not
to
be
encouraged
by
in
this
respect
or
by
too
tight
lacing
or
buttoning
of
dresses
nor
a
small
foot
cultivated
by
the
use
of
tight
shoes
nursemaids
would
do
well
to
repeat
to
the
parents
faithfully
and
truly
the
defects
they
observe
in
the
dispositions
of
very
young
children
if
properly
checked
in
time
evil
propensities
may
be
eradicated
but
this
should
not
extend
to
anything
but
serious
defects
otherwise
the
intuitive
perceptions
which
all
children
possess
will
construe
the
act
into
spying
and
informing
which
should
never
be
resorted
to
in
the
case
of
children
nor
indeed
in
any
case
such
are
the
cares
which
devolve
upon
the
nursemaid
and
it
is
her
duty
to
fulfil
them
personally
in
large
establishments
she
will
have
assistants
proportioned
to
the
number
of
children
of
which
she
has
the
care
the
under
nursemaid
lights
the
fires
sweeps
scours
and
dusts
the
rooms
and
makes
the
beds
empties
slops
and
carries
up
water
brings
up
and
removes
the
nursery
meals
washes
and
dresses
all
the
children
except
the
infant
and
assists
in
mending
where
there
is
a
nursery
girl
to
assist
she
does
the
rougher
part
of
the
cleaning
and
all
take
their
meals
in
the
nursery
together
after
the
children
of
the
family
have
done
in
smaller
families
where
there
is
only
one
nursemaid
kept
she
is
assisted
by
the
housemaid
or
who
will
do
the
rougher
part
of
the
work
and
carry
up
the
nursery
meals
in
such
circumstances
she
will
be
more
immediately
under
the
eye
of
her
mistress
who
will
probably
relieve
her
from
some
of
the
cares
of
the
infant
in
higher
families
the
upper
nurse
is
usually
permitted
to
sup
or
dine
occasionally
at
the
housekeeper
table
by
way
of
relaxation
when
the
children
are
all
well
and
her
subordinates
trustworthy
where
the
nurse
has
the
entire
charge
of
the
nursery
and
the
mother
is
too
much
occupied
to
do
more
than
pay
a
daily
visit
to
it
it
is
desirable
that
she
be
a
person
of
observation
and
possess
some
acquaintance
with
the
diseases
incident
to
childhood
as
also
with
such
simple
remedies
as
may
be
useful
before
a
medical
attendant
can
be
procured
or
where
such
attendance
is
not
considered
necessary
all
these
little
ailments
are
preceded
by
symptoms
so
minute
as
to
be
only
perceptible
to
close
observation
such
as
twitching
of
the
brows
restless
sleep
grinding
the
gums
and
in
some
inflammatory
diseases
even
to
the
child
abstaining
from
crying
from
fear
of
the
increased
pain
produced
by
the
movement
dentition
or
cutting
the
teeth
is
attended
with
many
of
these
symptoms
measles
thrush
scarlatina
croup
and
other
childish
complaints
are
all
preceded
by
symptoms
which
may
be
alleviated
and
rendered
less
virulent
by
simple
remedies
instantaneously
applied
is
usually
the
first
serious
trouble
bringing
many
other
disorders
in
its
train
the
symptoms
are
most
perceptible
to
the
mother
the
child
sucks
feebly
and
with
gums
hot
inflamed
and
swollen
in
this
case
relief
is
yielded
by
rubbing
them
from
time
to
time
with
a
little
of
johnson
soothing
syrup
a
valuable
and
perfectly
safe
medicine
selfish
and
thoughtless
nurses
and
mothers
too
sometimes
give
cordials
and
whose
effects
are
too
well
known
sometimes
follow
the
feverish
restlessness
produced
by
these
causes
in
which
case
a
hot
bath
should
be
administered
without
delay
and
the
lower
parts
of
the
body
rubbed
the
bath
being
as
hot
as
it
can
be
without
scalding
the
tender
skin
at
the
same
time
the
doctor
should
be
sent
for
immediately
for
no
nurse
should
administer
medicine
in
this
case
unless
the
fits
have
been
repeated
and
the
doctor
has
left
directions
with
her
how
to
act
is
one
of
the
most
alarming
diseases
of
childhood
it
is
accompanied
with
a
hoarse
croaking
ringing
cough
and
comes
on
very
suddenly
and
most
so
in
strong
robust
children
a
very
hot
bath
should
be
instantly
administered
followed
by
an
emetic
either
in
the
form
of
or
a
teaspoonful
of
ipecacuanha
wrapping
the
body
warmly
up
in
flannel
after
the
bath
the
slightest
delay
in
administering
the
bath
or
the
emetic
may
be
fatal
hence
the
importance
of
nurses
about
very
young
children
being
acquainted
with
the
symptoms
is
generally
preceded
by
the
moaning
noise
during
sleep
which
even
adults
threatened
with
the
disorder
can
not
avoid
it
is
followed
by
violent
fits
of
coughing
which
little
can
be
done
to
relieve
a
child
attacked
by
this
disorder
should
be
kept
as
much
as
possible
in
the
fresh
pure
air
but
out
of
draughts
and
kept
warm
and
supplied
with
plenty
of
nourishing
food
many
fatal
diseases
flow
from
this
scourge
of
childhood
and
a
change
to
purer
air
if
possible
should
follow
convalescence
are
the
torment
of
some
children
the
symptoms
are
an
unnatural
craving
for
food
even
after
a
full
meal
costiveness
suddenly
followed
by
the
reverse
fetid
breath
a
livid
circle
under
the
eyes
enlarged
abdomen
and
picking
the
nose
for
which
the
remedies
must
be
prescribed
by
the
doctor
and
much
resemble
each
other
in
their
early
stages
headache
restlessness
and
fretfulness
are
the
symptoms
of
both
shivering
fits
succeeded
by
a
hot
skin
pains
in
the
back
and
limbs
accompanied
by
sickness
and
in
severe
cases
sore
throat
pain
about
the
jaws
difficulty
in
swallowing
running
at
the
eyes
which
become
red
and
inflamed
while
the
face
is
hot
and
flushed
often
distinguish
scarlatina
and
scarlet
fever
of
which
it
is
only
a
mild
form
while
the
case
is
doubtful
a
of
spirit
of
nitre
diluted
in
water
given
at
bedtime
will
throw
the
child
into
a
gentle
perspiration
and
will
bring
out
the
rash
in
either
case
in
measles
this
appears
first
on
the
face
in
scarlatina
on
the
chest
and
in
both
cases
a
doctor
should
be
called
in
in
scarlatina
powder
or
ipecacuanha
may
be
administered
in
the
mean
time
in
all
cases
cleanliness
fresh
air
clean
utensils
and
frequent
washing
of
the
person
both
of
nurse
and
children
are
even
more
necessary
in
the
nursery
than
in
either
or
inasmuch
as
the
delicate
organs
of
childhood
are
more
susceptible
of
injury
from
smells
and
vapours
than
adults
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
if
we
conclude
this
brief
notice
of
the
duties
of
a
nursemaid
by
an
extract
from
florence
admirable
notes
on
nursing
referring
to
children
she
says
they
are
much
more
susceptible
than
grown
people
to
all
noxious
influences
they
are
affected
by
the
same
things
but
much
more
quickly
and
seriously
by
want
of
fresh
air
of
proper
warmth
want
of
cleanliness
in
house
clothes
bedding
or
body
by
improper
food
want
of
punctuality
by
dulness
by
want
of
light
by
too
much
or
too
little
covering
in
bed
or
when
up
and
all
this
in
health
and
then
she
quotes
a
passage
from
a
lecture
on
sudden
deaths
in
infancy
to
show
the
importance
of
careful
nursing
of
children
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
when
death
suddenly
befalls
the
infant
or
young
child
it
is
an
it
is
not
a
necessary
inevitable
result
of
any
disease
that
which
is
known
to
injure
children
most
seriously
is
foul
air
keeping
the
rooms
where
they
sleep
closely
shut
up
is
destruction
to
them
and
if
the
breathing
be
disordered
by
disease
a
few
hours
only
of
such
foul
air
may
endanger
its
life
even
where
no
inconvenience
is
felt
by
persons
in
the
room
persons
moving
in
the
beat
society
will
see
after
perusing
miss
nightingale
book
that
this
foul
air
want
of
light
too
much
or
too
little
clothing
and
improper
food
is
not
confined
to
crown
street
or
giles
that
belgravia
and
the
squares
have
their
north
room
where
the
rays
of
the
sun
never
reach
a
wooden
bedstead
two
or
three
mattresses
piled
up
to
above
the
height
of
the
table
a
vallance
attached
to
the
frame
nothing
but
a
miracle
could
ever
thoroughly
dry
or
air
such
a
bed
and
bedding
is
the
ordinary
bed
of
a
private
house
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
unwholesome
do
treat
your
children
like
sick
she
sums
up
do
dose
them
with
tea
let
them
eat
meat
and
drink
milk
or
half
a
glass
of
light
beer
give
them
fresh
light
sunny
and
open
rooms
cool
bedrooms
plenty
of
outdoor
exercise
facing
even
the
cold
and
wind
and
weather
in
sufficiently
warm
clothes
and
with
sufficient
exercise
plenty
of
amusements
and
play
more
liberty
and
less
schooling
and
cramming
and
training
more
attention
to
food
and
less
to
physic
duties
of
the
all
women
are
likely
at
some
period
of
their
lives
to
be
called
on
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
and
should
prepare
themselves
as
much
as
possible
by
observation
and
reading
for
the
occasion
when
they
may
be
required
to
perform
the
office
the
main
requirements
are
good
temper
compassion
for
suffering
sympathy
with
sufferers
which
most
women
worthy
of
the
name
possess
quiet
manners
love
of
order
and
cleanliness
with
these
qualifications
there
will
be
very
little
to
be
wished
for
the
desire
to
relieve
suffering
will
inspire
a
thousand
little
attentions
and
surmount
the
disgusts
which
some
of
the
offices
attending
the
are
apt
to
create
where
serious
illness
visits
a
household
and
protracted
nursing
is
likely
to
become
necessary
a
professional
nurse
will
probably
be
engaged
who
has
been
trained
to
its
duties
but
in
some
families
and
those
not
a
few
let
us
hope
the
ladies
of
the
family
would
oppose
such
an
arrangement
as
a
failure
of
duty
on
their
part
there
is
besides
even
when
a
professional
nurse
is
ultimately
called
in
a
period
of
doubt
and
hesitation
while
disease
has
not
yet
developed
itself
when
the
patient
must
be
attended
to
and
in
these
cases
some
of
the
female
servants
of
the
establishment
must
give
their
attendance
in
the
there
are
also
slight
attacks
of
cold
influenza
and
accidents
in
a
thousand
forms
to
which
all
are
subject
where
domestic
nursing
becomes
a
necessity
where
disease
though
unattended
with
danger
is
nevertheless
accompanied
by
the
nervous
irritation
incident
to
illness
and
when
all
the
attention
of
the
domestic
nurse
becomes
necessary
in
the
first
stage
of
sickness
while
doubt
and
a
little
perplexity
hang
over
the
household
as
to
the
nature
of
the
sickness
there
are
some
things
about
which
no
doubt
can
exist
the
patient
room
must
be
kept
in
a
perfectly
pure
state
and
arrangements
made
for
proper
attendance
for
the
first
canon
of
nursing
according
to
florence
nightingale
its
apostle
is
to
keep
the
air
the
patient
breathes
as
pure
as
the
external
air
without
chilling
him
this
can
be
done
without
any
preparation
which
might
alarm
the
patient
with
proper
windows
open
fireplaces
and
a
supply
of
fuel
the
room
may
be
as
fresh
as
it
is
outside
and
kept
at
a
temperature
suitable
for
the
state
windows
however
must
be
opened
from
above
and
not
from
below
and
draughts
avoided
cool
air
admitted
beneath
the
patient
head
chills
the
lower
strata
and
the
floor
the
careful
nurse
will
keep
the
door
shut
when
the
window
is
open
she
will
also
take
care
that
the
patient
is
not
placed
between
the
door
and
the
open
window
nor
between
the
open
fireplace
and
the
window
if
confined
to
bed
she
will
see
that
the
bed
is
placed
in
a
thoroughly
ventilated
part
of
the
room
but
out
of
the
current
of
air
which
is
produced
by
the
momentary
opening
of
doors
as
well
as
out
of
the
line
of
draught
between
the
window
and
the
open
chimney
and
that
the
temperature
of
the
room
is
kept
about
where
it
is
necessary
to
admit
air
by
the
door
the
windows
should
be
closed
but
there
are
few
circumstances
in
which
good
air
can
be
obtained
through
the
through
it
on
the
contrary
the
gases
generated
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
house
are
likely
to
be
drawn
into
the
invalid
chamber
these
precautions
taken
and
plain
nourishing
diet
such
as
the
patient
desires
furnished
probably
little
more
can
be
done
unless
more
serious
symptoms
present
themselves
in
which
case
medical
advice
will
be
sought
under
no
circumstances
is
ventilation
of
the
so
essential
as
in
cases
of
febrile
diseases
usually
considered
infectious
such
as
typhus
and
puerperal
fevers
influenza
and
scarlet
fever
measles
and
erysipelas
all
these
are
considered
communicable
through
the
air
but
there
is
little
danger
of
infection
being
thus
communicated
provided
the
room
is
kept
thoroughly
ventilated
on
the
contrary
if
this
essential
be
neglected
the
power
of
infection
is
greatly
increased
and
concentrated
in
the
confined
and
impure
air
it
settles
upon
the
clothes
of
the
attendants
and
visitors
especially
where
they
are
of
wool
and
is
frequently
communicated
to
other
families
in
this
manner
under
all
circumstances
therefore
the
should
be
kept
as
fresh
and
sweet
as
the
open
air
while
the
temperature
is
kept
up
by
artificial
heat
taking
care
that
the
fire
burns
clear
and
gives
out
no
smoke
into
the
room
that
the
room
is
perfectly
clean
wiped
over
with
a
damp
cloth
every
day
if
boarded
and
swept
after
sprinkling
with
damp
or
other
aromatic
leaves
if
carpeted
that
all
utensils
are
emptied
and
cleaned
as
soon
as
used
and
not
once
in
hours
as
is
sometimes
done
a
miss
nightingale
says
should
never
enter
a
everything
should
be
carried
direct
to
the
emptied
there
and
brought
up
clean
in
the
best
hospitals
the
is
unknown
i
do
not
approve
says
miss
nightingale
of
making
housemaids
of
nurses
that
would
be
waste
of
means
but
i
have
seen
surgical
sisters
women
whose
hands
were
worth
to
them
two
or
three
guineas
a
week
down
on
their
knees
scouring
a
room
or
hut
because
they
thought
it
was
not
fit
for
their
patients
these
women
had
the
true
nurse
spirit
bad
smells
are
sometimes
met
by
sprinkling
a
little
liquid
chloride
of
lime
on
the
floor
fumigation
by
burning
pastiles
is
also
a
common
expedient
for
the
purification
of
the
they
are
useful
but
only
in
the
sense
hinted
at
by
the
medical
lecturer
who
commenced
his
lecture
thus
fumigations
gentlemen
are
of
essential
importance
they
make
so
abominable
a
smell
that
they
compel
you
to
open
the
windows
and
admit
fresh
air
in
this
sense
they
are
useful
but
ineffectual
unless
the
cause
be
removed
and
fresh
air
admitted
the
should
be
quiet
no
talking
no
gossiping
and
above
all
no
whispering
this
is
absolute
cruelty
to
the
patient
he
thinks
his
complaint
the
subject
and
strains
his
ear
painfully
to
catch
the
sound
no
rustling
of
dresses
nor
creaking
shoes
either
where
the
carpets
are
taken
up
the
nurse
should
wear
list
shoes
or
some
other
noiseless
material
and
her
dress
should
be
of
soft
material
that
does
not
rustle
miss
nightingale
denounces
crinoline
and
quotes
lord
melbourne
on
the
subject
of
women
in
the
who
said
i
would
rather
have
men
about
me
when
ill
than
women
it
requires
very
strong
health
to
put
up
with
women
ungrateful
man
but
absolute
quiet
is
necessary
in
the
never
let
the
patient
be
waked
out
of
his
first
sleep
by
noise
never
roused
by
anything
like
a
surprise
always
sit
in
the
apartment
so
that
the
patient
has
you
in
view
and
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
him
to
turn
in
speaking
to
you
never
keep
a
patient
standing
never
speak
to
one
while
moving
never
lean
on
the
above
all
be
calm
and
decisive
with
the
patient
and
prevent
all
noises
a
careful
nurse
when
a
patient
leaves
his
bed
will
open
the
sheets
wide
and
throw
the
clothes
back
so
as
thoroughly
to
air
the
bed
she
will
avoid
drying
or
airing
anything
damp
in
the
it
is
another
fallacy
says
florence
nightingale
to
suppose
that
night
air
is
injurious
a
great
authority
told
me
that
in
london
the
air
is
never
so
good
as
after
ten
when
smoke
has
diminished
but
then
it
must
be
air
from
without
not
within
and
not
air
vitiated
by
gaseous
airs
a
great
fallacy
prevails
also
she
says
in
another
section
about
flowers
poisoning
the
air
of
the
no
one
ever
saw
them
the
but
if
they
did
they
actually
absorb
carbonic
acid
and
give
off
oxygen
cut
flowers
also
decompose
water
and
produce
oxygen
gas
lilies
and
some
other
very
odorous
plants
may
perhaps
give
out
smells
unsuited
to
a
close
room
while
the
atmosphere
of
the
should
always
be
fresh
and
natural
patients
says
miss
nightingale
are
sometimes
starved
in
the
midst
of
plenty
from
want
of
attention
to
the
ways
which
alone
make
it
possible
for
them
to
take
food
a
spoonful
of
or
arrowroot
and
wine
or
some
other
light
nourishing
diet
should
be
given
every
hour
for
the
patient
stomach
will
reject
large
supplies
in
very
weak
patients
there
is
often
a
nervous
difficulty
in
swallowing
which
is
much
increased
if
food
is
not
ready
and
presented
at
the
moment
when
it
is
wanted
the
nurse
should
be
able
to
discriminate
and
know
when
this
moment
is
approaching
diet
suitable
for
patients
will
depend
in
some
degree
on
their
natural
likes
and
dislikes
which
the
nurse
will
do
well
to
acquaint
herself
with
is
useful
and
relishing
but
possesses
little
nourishment
when
evaporated
it
presents
a
teaspoonful
of
solid
meat
to
a
pint
of
water
eggs
are
not
equivalent
to
the
same
weight
of
meat
arrowroot
is
less
nourishing
than
flour
butter
is
the
lightest
and
most
digestible
kind
of
fat
cream
in
some
diseases
can
not
be
replaced
but
to
sum
up
with
some
of
miss
nightingale
useful
maxims
observation
is
the
nurse
best
guide
and
the
patient
appetite
the
rule
half
a
pint
of
milk
is
equal
to
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
meat
is
the
least
nourishing
food
administered
to
the
sick
and
tea
and
coffee
she
thinks
are
both
too
much
excluded
from
the
the
monthly
nurse
the
choice
of
a
monthly
nurse
is
of
the
utmost
importance
and
in
the
case
of
a
young
mother
with
her
first
child
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
seek
advice
and
counsel
from
her
more
experienced
relatives
in
this
matter
in
the
first
place
the
engaging
a
monthly
nurse
in
good
time
is
of
the
utmost
importance
as
if
she
be
competent
and
clever
her
services
will
be
sought
months
beforehand
a
good
nurse
having
seldom
much
of
her
time
disengaged
there
are
some
qualifications
which
it
is
evident
the
nurse
should
possess
she
should
be
scrupulously
clean
and
tidy
in
her
person
honest
sober
and
noiseless
in
her
movements
should
possess
a
natural
love
for
children
and
have
a
strong
nerve
in
case
of
emergencies
and
must
not
be
included
in
her
habits
but
these
are
happily
much
less
frequent
than
they
were
in
former
days
receiving
as
she
often
will
instructions
from
the
doctor
she
should
bear
these
in
mind
and
carefully
carry
them
out
in
those
instances
where
she
does
not
feel
herself
sufficiently
informed
she
should
ask
advice
from
the
medical
man
and
not
take
upon
herself
to
administer
medicines
without
his
knowledge
a
monthly
nurse
should
be
between
and
years
of
age
sufficiently
old
to
have
had
a
little
experience
and
yet
not
too
old
or
infirm
to
be
able
to
perform
various
duties
requiring
strength
and
bodily
vigour
she
should
be
able
to
wake
the
moment
she
is
called
at
any
hour
of
the
night
that
the
mother
or
child
may
have
their
wants
immediately
attended
to
good
temper
united
to
a
kind
and
gentle
disposition
is
indispensable
and
although
the
nurse
will
frequently
have
much
to
endure
from
the
whims
and
caprices
of
the
invalid
she
should
make
allowances
for
these
and
command
her
temper
at
the
same
time
exerting
her
authority
when
it
is
necessary
what
the
nurse
has
to
do
in
the
way
of
cleaning
and
dusting
her
lady
room
depends
entirely
on
the
establishment
that
is
kept
where
there
are
plenty
of
servants
the
nurse
of
course
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
but
attend
on
her
patient
and
ring
the
bell
for
anything
she
may
require
where
the
number
of
domestics
is
limited
she
should
not
mind
keeping
her
room
in
order
that
is
to
say
sweeping
and
dusting
it
every
morning
if
fires
be
necessary
the
housemaid
should
always
clean
the
grate
and
do
all
that
is
wanted
in
that
way
as
this
being
rather
dirty
work
would
soil
the
nurse
dress
and
unfit
her
to
approach
the
bed
or
take
the
infant
without
soiling
its
clothes
in
small
establishments
too
the
nurse
should
herself
fetch
things
she
may
require
and
not
ring
every
time
she
wants
anything
and
she
must
of
course
not
leave
her
invalid
unless
she
sees
everything
is
comfortable
and
then
only
for
a
few
minutes
when
down
stairs
and
in
company
with
the
other
servants
the
nurse
should
not
repeat
what
she
may
have
heard
in
her
lady
room
as
much
mischief
may
be
done
by
a
gossiping
nurse
as
in
most
houses
the
monthly
nurse
is
usually
sent
for
a
few
days
before
her
services
may
be
required
she
should
see
that
all
is
in
readiness
that
there
be
no
bustle
and
hurry
at
the
time
the
confinement
takes
place
she
should
keep
two
pairs
of
sheets
thoroughly
aired
as
well
as
flannels
all
the
things
which
will
be
required
to
dress
the
baby
the
first
time
should
be
laid
in
the
basket
in
readiness
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
to
be
put
on
as
well
as
scissors
thread
a
few
pieces
of
soft
linen
rag
and
two
or
three
flannel
squares
if
a
berceaunette
is
to
be
used
immediately
the
nurse
should
ascertain
that
the
mattresses
pillow
are
all
well
aired
and
if
not
already
done
before
she
arrives
she
should
assist
in
covering
and
trimming
it
ready
for
the
little
occupant
a
monthly
nurse
should
be
handy
at
her
needle
as
if
she
is
in
the
house
some
time
before
the
baby
is
born
she
will
require
some
work
of
this
sort
to
occupy
her
time
she
should
also
understand
the
of
little
caps
although
we
can
scarcely
say
this
is
one
of
the
nurse
duties
as
most
children
wear
no
caps
except
out
of
doors
her
powers
in
this
way
will
not
be
much
taxed
a
nurse
should
endeavour
to
make
her
room
as
cheerful
as
possible
and
always
keep
it
clean
and
tidy
she
should
empty
the
chamber
utensils
as
soon
as
used
and
on
no
account
put
things
under
the
bed
soiled
baby
napkins
should
be
rolled
up
and
put
into
a
pan
when
they
should
be
washed
out
every
morning
and
hung
out
to
dry
they
are
then
in
a
fit
state
to
send
to
the
laundress
and
should
on
no
account
be
left
dirty
but
done
every
morning
in
this
way
the
bedroom
should
be
kept
rather
dark
particularly
for
the
first
week
or
ten
days
of
a
regular
temperature
and
as
free
as
possible
from
draughts
at
the
same
time
well
ventilated
and
free
from
unpleasant
smells
the
infant
during
the
month
must
not
be
exposed
to
strong
light
or
much
air
and
in
carrying
it
about
the
passages
stairs
the
nurse
should
always
have
its
on
to
protect
the
eyes
and
ears
from
the
currents
of
air
for
the
management
of
children
we
must
refer
our
readers
to
the
following
chapters
and
we
need
only
say
in
conclusion
that
a
good
nurse
should
understand
the
symptoms
of
various
ills
incident
to
this
period
as
in
all
cases
prevention
is
better
than
cure
as
young
mothers
with
their
first
baby
are
very
often
much
troubled
at
first
with
their
breasts
the
nurse
should
understand
the
art
of
emptying
them
by
suction
or
some
other
contrivance
if
the
breasts
are
kept
well
drawn
there
will
be
but
little
danger
of
inflammation
and
as
the
infant
at
first
can
not
take
all
that
is
necessary
something
must
be
done
to
keep
the
inflammation
down
this
is
one
of
the
greatest
difficulties
a
nurse
has
to
contend
with
and
we
can
only
advise
her
to
be
very
persevering
to
rub
the
breasts
well
and
to
let
the
infant
suck
as
soon
and
as
often
as
possible
until
they
get
in
proper
order
the
we
are
aware
that
according
to
the
opinion
of
some
ladies
there
is
no
domestic
theme
during
a
certain
period
of
their
married
lives
more
fraught
with
vexation
and
disquietude
than
that
source
of
annoyance
the
nurse
but
as
we
believe
there
are
thousands
of
excellent
wives
and
mothers
who
pass
through
life
without
even
a
temporary
embroglio
in
the
kitchen
or
suffering
a
state
of
moral
hectic
the
whole
time
of
a
nurse
empire
in
the
nursery
or
bedroom
our
own
experience
goes
to
prove
that
although
many
unqualified
persons
palm
themselves
off
on
ladies
as
fully
competent
for
the
duties
they
so
rashly
and
dishonestly
undertake
to
perform
and
thus
expose
themselves
to
and
merited
censure
there
are
still
very
many
fully
equal
to
the
legitimate
exercise
of
what
they
undertake
and
if
they
do
not
in
every
case
give
entire
satisfaction
some
of
the
fault
and
sometimes
a
great
deal
of
it
may
be
honestly
placed
to
the
account
of
the
ladies
themselves
who
in
many
instances
are
so
impressed
with
the
propriety
of
their
own
method
of
performing
everything
as
to
insist
upon
the
adoption
of
system
in
preference
to
that
of
the
nurse
whose
plan
is
probably
based
on
a
comprehensive
forethought
and
rendered
perfect
in
all
its
details
by
an
ample
experience
in
all
our
remarks
on
this
subject
we
should
remember
with
gentleness
the
order
of
society
from
which
our
nurses
are
drawn
and
that
those
who
make
their
duty
a
study
and
are
termed
professional
nurses
have
much
to
endure
from
the
caprice
and
egotism
of
their
employers
while
others
are
driven
to
the
occupation
from
the
laudable
motive
of
feeding
their
own
children
and
who
in
fulfilling
that
object
are
too
often
both
selfish
and
sensual
performing
without
further
interest
than
is
consistent
with
their
own
advantage
the
routine
of
customary
duties
properly
speaking
there
are
two
nurses
the
nurse
for
the
mother
and
the
nurse
for
the
child
or
the
monthly
and
the
wet
nurse
of
the
former
we
have
already
spoken
and
will
now
proceed
to
describe
the
duties
of
the
latter
and
add
some
suggestions
as
to
her
age
physical
health
and
moral
conduct
subjects
of
the
utmost
importance
as
far
as
the
charge
intrusted
to
her
is
concerned
and
therefore
demanding
some
special
remarks
when
from
illness
suppression
of
the
milk
accident
or
some
natural
process
the
mother
is
deprived
of
the
pleasure
of
rearing
her
infant
it
becomes
necessary
at
once
to
look
around
for
a
fitting
substitute
so
that
the
child
may
not
suffer
by
any
needless
delay
a
physical
loss
by
the
deprivation
of
its
natural
food
the
first
consideration
should
be
as
regards
age
state
of
health
and
temper
the
age
if
possible
should
not
be
less
than
twenty
nor
exceed
thirty
years
with
the
health
sound
in
every
respect
and
the
body
free
from
all
eruptive
disease
or
local
blemish
the
best
evidence
of
a
sound
state
of
health
will
be
found
in
the
woman
clear
open
countenance
the
ruddy
tone
of
the
skin
the
full
round
and
elastic
state
of
the
breasts
and
especially
in
the
erectile
firm
condition
of
the
nipple
which
in
all
unhealthy
states
of
the
body
is
pendulous
flabby
and
relaxed
in
which
case
the
milk
is
sure
to
be
imperfect
in
its
organization
and
consequently
deficient
in
its
nutrient
qualities
appetite
is
another
indication
of
health
in
the
suckling
nurse
or
mother
for
it
is
impossible
a
woman
can
feed
her
child
without
having
a
corresponding
appetite
and
though
inordinate
craving
for
food
is
neither
desirable
nor
necessary
a
natural
vigour
should
be
experienced
at
and
the
food
taken
should
be
anticipated
and
enjoyed
besides
her
health
the
moral
state
of
the
nurse
is
to
be
taken
into
account
or
that
mental
discipline
or
principle
of
conduct
which
would
deter
the
nurse
from
at
any
time
gratifying
her
own
pleasures
and
appetites
at
the
cost
or
suffering
of
her
infant
charge
the
conscientiousness
and
good
faith
that
would
prevent
a
nurse
so
acting
are
unfortunately
very
rare
and
many
nurses
rather
than
forego
the
enjoyment
of
a
favourite
dish
though
morally
certain
of
the
effect
it
will
have
on
the
child
will
on
the
first
opportunity
feed
with
avidity
on
fried
meats
cabbage
cucumbers
pickles
or
other
crude
and
injurious
aliments
in
defiance
of
all
orders
given
or
confidence
reposed
in
their
word
good
sense
and
humanity
and
when
the
infant
is
afterwards
racked
with
pain
and
a
night
of
disquiet
alarms
the
mother
the
doctor
is
sent
for
and
the
nurse
covering
her
dereliction
by
a
falsehood
the
consequence
of
her
gluttony
is
treated
as
a
disease
and
the
poor
infant
is
dosed
for
some
days
with
medicines
that
can
do
it
but
little
if
any
good
and
in
all
probability
materially
retard
its
physical
development
the
selfish
nurse
in
her
ignorance
believes
too
that
as
long
as
she
experiences
no
admonitory
symptoms
herself
the
child
can
not
suffer
and
satisfied
that
whatever
is
the
cause
of
its
screams
and
plunges
neither
she
nor
what
she
had
eaten
had
anything
to
do
with
it
with
this
flattering
assurance
at
her
heart
she
watches
her
opportunity
and
has
another
luxurious
feast
off
the
proscribed
dainties
till
the
increasing
disturbance
in
the
child
health
or
treachery
from
the
kitchen
opens
the
eyes
of
mother
and
doctor
to
the
nurse
unprincipled
conduct
in
all
such
cases
the
infant
should
be
spared
the
infliction
of
medicine
and
as
a
wholesome
corrective
to
herself
and
relief
to
her
charge
a
good
sound
dose
administered
to
the
nurse
respecting
the
diet
of
the
the
first
point
of
importance
is
to
fix
early
and
definite
hours
for
every
meal
and
the
mother
should
see
that
no
cause
is
ever
allowed
to
interfere
with
their
punctuality
the
food
itself
should
be
light
easy
of
digestion
and
simple
boiled
or
roast
meat
with
bread
and
potatoes
with
occasionally
a
piece
of
sago
rice
or
tapioca
pudding
should
constitute
the
dinner
the
only
meal
that
requires
special
comment
broths
green
vegetables
and
all
acid
or
salt
foods
must
be
avoided
fresh
fish
once
or
twice
a
week
may
be
taken
but
it
is
hardly
sufficiently
nutritious
to
be
often
used
as
a
meal
if
the
dinner
is
taken
early
at
one
there
will
be
no
occasion
for
luncheon
which
too
often
to
the
injury
of
the
child
is
made
the
cover
for
a
first
dinner
half
a
pint
of
stout
with
a
reading
biscuit
at
eleven
will
be
abundantly
sufficient
between
breakfast
at
eight
and
a
good
dinner
with
a
pint
of
porter
at
one
about
eight
in
the
evening
half
a
pint
of
stout
with
another
biscuit
may
be
taken
and
for
supper
at
ten
or
a
pint
of
porter
with
a
slice
of
toast
or
a
small
amount
of
bread
and
cheese
may
conclude
the
feeding
for
the
day
animal
food
once
in
hours
is
quite
sufficient
all
spirits
unless
in
extreme
cases
should
be
avoided
and
wine
is
still
more
seldom
needed
with
a
due
quantity
of
plain
digestible
food
and
the
proportion
of
stout
and
porter
ordered
with
early
hours
and
regularity
the
nurse
will
not
only
be
strong
and
healthy
herself
but
fully
capable
of
rearing
a
child
in
health
and
strength
there
are
two
points
all
mothers
who
are
obliged
to
employ
should
remember
and
be
on
their
guard
against
the
first
is
never
to
allow
a
nurse
to
give
medicine
to
the
infant
on
her
own
authority
many
have
such
an
infatuated
idea
of
the
of
that
they
would
administer
a
dose
of
this
disgusting
grease
twice
a
week
and
think
they
had
done
a
meritorious
service
to
the
child
the
next
point
is
to
watch
carefully
lest
to
insure
a
night
sleep
for
herself
she
does
not
dose
the
infant
with
godfrey
cordial
syrup
of
poppies
or
some
narcotic
potion
to
insure
tranquillity
to
the
one
and
give
the
opportunity
of
sleep
to
the
other
the
fact
that
scores
of
nurses
keep
secret
bottles
of
these
deadly
syrups
for
the
purpose
of
stilling
their
charges
is
notorious
and
that
many
use
them
to
a
fearful
extent
is
sufficiently
patent
to
all
it
therefore
behoves
the
mother
while
obliged
to
trust
to
a
nurse
to
use
her
best
discretion
to
guard
her
child
from
the
unprincipled
treatment
of
the
person
she
must
to
a
certain
extent
depend
upon
and
trust
and
to
remember
in
all
cases
rather
than
resort
to
or
sedatives
to
consult
a
medical
man
for
her
infant
in
preference
to
following
the
counsel
of
her
nurse
the
rearing

and
diseases
of

and

chapter

physiology
of

as
illustrated

and

the

management
of
children
like
the
mother
love
for
her
offspring
seems
to
be
born
with
the
child
and
to
be
a
direct
intelligence
of
nature
it
may
thus
at
first
sight
appear
as
inconsistent
and
presumptuous
to
tell
a
woman
how
to
rear
her
infant
as
to
instruct
her
in
the
manner
of
loving
it
yet
though
nature
is
unquestionably
the
best
nurse
art
makes
so
admirable
a
that
no
sensible
woman
in
her
novitiate
of
parent
would
refuse
the
admonitions
of
art
or
the
teachings
of
experience
to
consummate
her
duties
of
nurse
it
is
true
that
in
a
civilized
state
of
society
few
young
wives
reach
the
epoch
that
makes
them
mothers
without
some
insight
traditional
or
practical
into
the
management
of
infants
consequently
the
cases
wherein
a
woman
is
left
to
her
own
unaided
intelligence
or
what
in
such
a
case
may
be
called
instinct
and
obliged
to
trust
to
the
promptings
of
nature
alone
for
the
of
her
child
are
very
rare
indeed
again
every
woman
is
not
gifted
with
the
same
physical
ability
for
the
harassing
duties
of
a
mother
and
though
nature
as
a
general
rule
has
endowed
all
female
creation
with
the
attributes
necessary
to
that
most
beautiful
and
at
the
same
time
holiest
function
the
healthy
rearing
of
their
offspring
the
cases
are
sufficiently
numerous
to
establish
the
exception
where
the
mother
is
either
physically
or
socially
incapacitated
from
undertaking
these
most
pleasing
duties
herself
and
where
consequently
she
is
compelled
to
trust
to
adventitious
aid
for
those
natural
benefits
which
are
at
once
the
mother
pride
and
delight
to
render
to
her
child
in
these
cases
when
obliged
to
call
in
the
services
of
hired
assistance
she
must
trust
the
dearest
obligation
of
her
life
to
one
who
from
her
social
sphere
has
probably
notions
of
rearing
children
diametrically
opposed
to
the
preconceived
ideas
of
the
mother
and
at
enmity
with
all
her
sentiments
of
right
and
prejudices
of
position
it
has
justly
been
said
we
think
by
hood
that
the
children
of
the
poor
are
not
brought
up
but
however
facetious
this
remark
may
seem
there
is
much
truth
in
it
and
that
children
reared
in
the
reeking
dens
of
squalor
and
poverty
live
at
all
is
an
apparent
anomaly
in
the
course
of
things
that
at
first
sight
would
seem
to
set
the
laws
of
sanitary
provision
at
defiance
and
make
it
appear
a
perfect
waste
of
time
to
insist
on
pure
air
and
exercise
as
indispensable
necessaries
of
life
and
especially
so
as
regards
infantine
existence
we
see
elaborate
care
bestowed
on
a
family
of
children
everything
studied
that
can
tend
to
their
personal
comfort
pure
air
pure
water
regular
ablution
a
dietary
prescribed
by
art
and
every
precaution
adopted
that
medical
judgment
and
maternal
love
can
dictate
for
the
of
the
parents
hope
and
find
in
despite
of
all
this
care
and
vigilance
disease
and
death
invading
the
guarded
treasure
we
turn
to
the
foetor
and
darkness
that
in
some
obscure
court
attend
the
robust
brood
who
coated
in
dirt
and
with
mud
and
refuse
for
playthings
live
and
thrive
and
grow
into
manhood
and
in
contrast
to
the
pale
face
and
flabby
flesh
of
the
aristocratic
child
exhibit
strength
vigour
and
frames
and
our
belief
in
the
potency
of
the
elements
of
air
light
and
cleanliness
receives
a
shock
that
at
first
sight
would
appear
fatal
to
the
implied
benefits
of
these
in
reality
attributes
of
health
and
life
but
as
we
must
enter
more
largely
on
this
subject
hereafter
we
shall
leave
its
consideration
for
the
present
and
return
to
what
we
were
about
to
say
respecting
trusting
to
others
aid
in
the
rearing
of
children
here
it
is
that
the
young
and
probably
inexperienced
mother
may
find
our
remarks
not
only
an
assistance
but
a
comfort
to
her
in
as
far
as
knowing
the
simplest
and
best
system
to
adopt
she
may
be
able
to
instruct
another
and
see
that
her
directions
are
fully
carried
out
the
human
body
materially
considered
is
a
beautiful
piece
of
mechanism
consisting
of
many
parts
each
one
being
the
centre
of
a
system
and
performing
its
own
vital
function
irrespectively
of
the
others
and
yet
dependent
for
its
vitality
upon
the
harmony
and
health
of
the
whole
it
is
in
fact
to
a
certain
extent
like
a
watch
which
when
once
wound
up
and
set
in
motion
will
continue
its
function
of
recording
true
time
only
so
long
as
every
wheel
spring
and
lever
performs
its
allotted
duty
and
at
its
allotted
time
or
till
the
limit
that
man
ingenuity
has
placed
to
its
existence
as
a
moving
automaton
has
been
reached
or
in
other
words
till
it
has
run
down
what
the
key
is
to
the
mechanical
watch
air
is
to
the
physical
man
once
admit
air
into
the
mouth
and
nostrils
and
the
lungs
expand
the
heart
beats
the
blood
rushes
to
the
remotest
part
of
the
body
the
mouth
secretes
saliva
to
soften
and
macerate
the
food
the
liver
forms
its
bile
to
separate
the
nutriment
from
the
digested
aliment
the
kidneys
perform
their
office
the
eye
elaborates
its
tears
to
facilitate
motion
and
impart
that
glistening
to
the
orb
on
which
depends
so
much
of
its
beauty
and
a
dewy
moisture
exudes
from
the
skin
protecting
the
body
from
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
and
sharpening
the
perception
of
touch
and
feeling
at
the
same
instant
and
in
every
part
the
arteries
like
innumerable
bees
are
everywhere
laying
down
layers
of
muscle
bones
teeth
and
in
fact
like
the
coral
zoophyte
building
up
a
continent
of
life
and
matter
while
the
veins
equally
busy
are
carrying
away
the
and
refuse
collected
from
where
the
zoophyte
arteries
are
building
this
refuse
in
its
turn
being
conveyed
to
the
liver
there
to
be
converted
into
bile
all
these
and
they
are
but
a
few
of
the
vital
actions
constantly
taking
place
are
the
instant
result
of
one
gasp
of
air
no
subject
can
be
fraught
with
greater
interest
than
watching
the
first
spark
of
life
as
it
courses
with
electric
speed
through
all
the
gates
and
alleys
of
the
soft
insensate
body
of
the
infant
the
effect
of
air
on
the
child
is
as
remarkable
in
its
results
as
it
is
wonderful
in
its
consequence
but
to
understand
this
more
intelligibly
it
must
first
be
remembered
that
life
consists
of
the
performance
of
vital
functions
respiration
circulation
and
digestion
the
lungs
digest
the
air
taking
from
it
its
most
nutritious
element
the
to
give
to
the
impoverished
blood
that
circulates
through
them
the
stomach
digests
the
food
and
separates
the
nutriment
from
the
aliment
which
it
gives
to
the
blood
for
the
development
of
the
frame
and
the
blood
which
is
understood
by
the
term
circulation
digests
in
its
passage
through
the
lungs
the
nutriment
to
give
it
quantity
and
quality
and
the
from
the
air
to
give
it
vitality
hence
it
will
be
seen
that
speaking
generally
the
three
vital
functions
resolve
themselves
into
one
digestion
and
that
the
lungs
are
the
primary
and
the
most
important
of
the
vital
organs
and
respiration
the
first
in
fact
as
we
all
know
it
is
the
last
in
deed
of
all
the
functions
performed
by
the
living
body
the
respiration
the
first
effect
of
air
on
the
infant
is
a
slight
tremor
about
the
lips
and
angles
of
the
mouth
increasing
to
twitchings
and
finally
to
a
convulsive
contraction
of
the
lips
and
cheeks
the
consequence
of
sudden
cold
to
the
nerves
of
the
face
this
spasmodic
action
produces
a
gasp
causing
the
air
to
rush
through
the
mouth
and
nostrils
and
enter
the
windpipe
and
upper
portion
of
the
flat
and
contracted
lungs
which
like
a
sponge
partly
immersed
in
water
immediately
expand
this
is
succeeded
by
a
few
faint
sobs
or
pants
by
which
larger
volumes
of
air
are
drawn
into
the
chest
till
after
a
few
seconds
and
when
a
greater
bulk
of
the
lungs
has
become
inflated
the
and
ribs
rise
the
chest
expands
and
with
a
sudden
start
the
infant
gives
utterance
to
a
succession
of
loud
sharp
cries
which
have
the
effect
of
filling
every
cell
of
the
entire
organ
with
air
and
life
to
the
anxious
mother
the
first
voice
of
her
child
is
doubtless
the
sweetest
music
she
ever
heard
and
the
more
loudly
it
peals
the
greater
should
be
her
joy
as
it
is
an
indication
of
health
and
strength
and
not
only
shows
the
perfect
expansion
of
the
lungs
but
that
the
process
of
life
has
set
in
with
vigour
having
welcomed
in
its
own
existence
like
the
morning
bird
with
a
shrill
note
of
gladness
the
infant
ceases
its
cry
and
after
a
few
short
sobs
usually
subsides
into
sleep
or
quietude
at
the
same
instant
that
the
air
rushes
into
the
lungs
the
valve
or
door
between
the
two
sides
of
the
through
which
the
blood
had
previously
closed
and
hermetically
sealed
and
the
blood
taking
a
new
course
bounds
into
the
lungs
now
expanded
with
air
and
which
we
have
likened
to
a
wetted
sponge
to
which
they
bear
a
not
unapt
affinity
air
being
substituted
for
water
it
here
receives
the
from
the
atmosphere
and
the
or
white
blood
from
the
digested
food
and
becomes
in
an
instant
arterial
blood
a
vital
principle
from
which
every
solid
and
fluid
of
the
body
is
constructed
besides
the
lungs
nature
has
provided
another
respiratory
organ
a
sort
of
supplemental
lung
that
as
well
as
being
a
covering
to
the
body
air
and
moisture
this
is
the
cuticle
or
skin
and
so
intimate
is
the
connection
between
the
skin
and
lungs
that
whatever
injures
the
first
is
certain
to
affect
the
latter
the
difficulty
of
breathing
experienced
after
scalds
or
burns
on
the
cuticle
the
cough
that
follows
the
absorption
of
cold
or
damp
by
the
skin
the
oppressed
and
laborious
breathing
experienced
by
children
in
all
eruptive
diseases
while
the
rash
is
coming
to
the
surface
and
the
hot
dry
skin
that
always
attends
congestion
of
the
lungs
and
the
great
practical
advantage
derivable
from
this
fact
is
the
knowledge
that
whatever
relieves
the
one
benefits
the
other
hence
too
the
great
utility
of
hot
baths
in
all
affections
of
the
lungs
or
diseases
of
the
skin
and
the
reason
why
exposure
to
cold
or
wet
is
in
nearly
all
cases
followed
by
tightness
of
the
chest
sore
throat
difficulty
of
breathing
and
cough
these
symptoms
are
the
consequence
of
a
larger
quantity
of
blood
than
is
natural
remaining
in
the
lungs
and
the
cough
is
a
mere
effort
of
nature
to
throw
off
the
obstruction
caused
by
the
presence
of
too
much
blood
in
the
organ
of
respiration
the
hot
bath
by
causing
a
larger
amount
of
blood
to
rush
suddenly
to
the
skin
has
the
effect
of
relieving
the
lungs
of
their
excess
of
blood
and
by
equalizing
the
circulation
and
promoting
perspiration
from
the
cuticle
affords
immediate
and
direct
benefit
both
to
the
lungs
and
the
system
at
large
the
stomach
digestion
the
organs
that
either
directly
or
indirectly
contribute
to
the
process
of
digestion
are
the
mouth
teeth
tongue
and
gullet
the
stomach
small
intestines
the
pancreas
the
salivary
glands
and
the
liver
next
to
respiration
digestion
is
the
chief
function
in
the
economy
of
life
as
without
the
nutritious
fluid
digested
from
the
aliment
there
would
be
nothing
to
supply
the
immense
and
constantly
recurring
waste
of
the
system
caused
by
the
activity
with
which
the
arteries
at
all
periods
but
especially
during
infancy
and
youth
are
building
up
the
frame
and
developing
the
body
in
infancy
the
period
of
which
our
present
subject
treats
the
series
of
parts
engaged
in
the
process
of
digestion
may
be
reduced
simply
to
the
stomach
and
liver
or
rather
its
secretion
the
bile
the
stomach
is
a
thick
muscular
bag
connected
above
with
the
gullet
and
at
its
lower
extremity
with
the
commencement
of
the
small
intestines
the
duty
or
function
of
the
stomach
is
to
secrete
from
the
arteries
spread
over
its
inner
surface
a
sharp
acid
liquid
called
the
juice
this
with
a
due
mixture
of
saliva
softens
dissolves
and
gradually
digests
the
food
or
contents
of
the
stomach
reducing
the
whole
into
a
soft
pulpy
mass
which
then
passes
into
the
first
part
of
the
small
intestines
where
it
comes
in
contact
with
the
bile
from
the
which
immediately
separates
the
digested
food
into
two
parts
one
is
a
white
creamy
fluid
called
chyle
and
the
absolute
concentration
of
all
nourishment
which
is
taken
up
by
proper
vessels
and
as
we
have
before
said
carried
directly
to
the
heart
to
be
made
blood
of
and
vitalized
in
the
lungs
and
thus
provide
for
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
system
it
must
be
here
observed
that
the
stomach
can
only
digest
solids
for
fluids
being
incapable
of
that
process
can
only
be
and
without
the
result
of
digestion
animal
at
least
human
life
could
not
exist
now
as
nature
has
ordained
that
infantine
life
shall
be
supported
on
liquid
aliment
and
as
without
a
digestion
the
body
would
perish
some
provision
was
necessary
to
meet
this
difficulty
and
that
provision
was
found
in
the
nature
of
the
liquid
itself
or
in
other
words
the
milk
the
process
of
making
cheese
or
fresh
curds
and
whey
is
familiar
to
most
persons
but
as
it
is
necessary
to
the
elucidation
of
our
subject
we
will
briefly
repeat
it
the
internal
membrane
or
the
lining
coat
of
a
calf
stomach
having
been
removed
from
the
organ
is
hung
up
like
a
bladder
to
dry
when
required
a
piece
is
cut
off
put
in
a
jug
a
little
warm
water
poured
upon
it
and
after
a
few
hours
it
is
fit
for
use
the
liquid
so
made
being
called
a
little
of
this
rennet
poured
into
a
basin
of
warm
milk
at
once
coagulates
the
greater
part
and
separates
from
it
a
quantity
of
thin
liquor
called
this
is
precisely
the
action
that
takes
place
in
the
infant
stomach
after
every
supply
from
the
breast
the
cause
is
the
same
in
both
cases
the
acid
of
the
gastric
juice
in
the
infant
stomach
immediately
converting
the
milk
into
a
soft
cheese
it
is
gastric
juice
adhering
to
the
stomach
and
drawn
out
by
the
water
forming
rennet
that
makes
the
curds
in
the
basin
the
cheesy
substance
being
a
solid
at
once
undergoes
the
process
of
digestion
is
separated
into
by
the
bile
and
in
a
few
hours
finds
its
way
to
the
infant
heart
to
become
blood
and
commence
the
architecture
of
its
little
frame
this
is
the
simple
process
of
a
baby
digestion
converted
into
cheese
cheese
into
chyle
into
blood
and
blood
into
flesh
bone
and
simple
is
the
cause
but
how
sublime
and
wonderful
are
the
effects
we
have
described
the
most
important
of
the
three
functions
that
take
place
in
the
infant
and
digestion
the
third
namely
circulation
we
hardly
think
it
necessary
to
enter
on
not
being
called
for
by
the
requirements
of
the
nurse
and
mother
so
we
shall
omit
its
notice
and
proceed
from
theoretical
to
more
practical
considerations
children
of
weakly
constitutions
are
just
as
likely
to
be
born
of
robust
parents
and
those
who
earn
their
bread
by
toil
as
the
offspring
of
luxury
and
affluence
and
indeed
it
is
against
the
ordinary
providence
of
nature
to
suppose
the
children
of
the
hardworking
and
necessitous
to
be
hardier
and
more
vigorous
than
those
of
parents
blessed
with
ease
and
competence
all
children
come
into
the
world
in
the
same
imploring
helplessness
with
the
same
general
organization
and
wants
and
demanding
either
from
the
mother
love
or
from
the
memory
of
motherly
feeling
in
the
nurse
or
the
common
appeals
of
humanity
in
those
who
undertake
the
earliest
duties
of
an
infant
the
same
assistance
and
protection
and
the
same
fostering
care
the
infant
we
have
already
described
the
phenomena
produced
on
the
child
by
the
contact
of
air
which
after
a
succession
of
muscular
twitchings
becomes
endowed
with
voice
and
heralds
its
advent
by
a
loud
but
brief
succession
of
cries
but
though
this
is
the
general
rule
it
sometimes
happens
from
causes
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
explain
that
the
infant
does
not
cry
or
give
utterance
to
any
audible
sounds
or
if
it
does
they
are
so
faint
as
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
as
human
accents
plainly
indicating
that
life
as
yet
to
the
new
visitor
is
neither
a
boon
nor
a
blessing
the
infant
being
in
fact
in
a
state
of
suspended
or
imperfect
vitality
a
state
of
existence
closely
approximating
the
condition
of
a
as
soon
as
this
state
of
things
is
discovered
the
child
should
be
turned
on
its
right
side
and
the
whole
length
of
the
spine
from
the
head
downwards
rubbed
with
all
the
fingers
of
the
right
hand
sharply
and
quickly
without
intermission
till
the
quick
action
has
not
only
evoked
heat
but
electricity
in
the
part
and
till
the
loud
and
sharp
cries
of
the
child
have
thoroughly
expanded
the
lungs
and
satisfactorily
established
its
life
the
operation
will
seldom
require
above
a
minute
to
effect
and
less
frequently
demands
a
repetition
if
there
is
brandy
at
hand
the
fingers
before
rubbing
may
be
dipped
into
that
or
any
other
spirit
another
condition
of
what
we
may
call
mute
births
where
the
child
only
makes
short
ineffectual
gasps
and
those
at
intervals
of
a
minute
or
two
apart
when
the
lips
eyelids
and
fingers
become
of
a
deep
purple
or
slate
colour
sometimes
half
the
body
remaining
white
while
the
other
half
which
was
at
first
swarthy
deepens
to
a
livid
hue
this
condition
of
the
infant
is
owing
to
the
valve
between
the
two
sides
of
the
heart
remaining
open
and
allowing
the
unvitalized
venous
blood
to
enter
the
arteries
and
get
into
the
circulation
the
object
in
this
case
as
in
the
previous
one
is
to
dilate
the
lungs
as
quickly
as
possible
so
that
by
the
sudden
effect
of
a
vigorous
inspiration
the
valve
may
be
firmly
closed
and
the
impure
blood
losing
this
means
of
egress
be
sent
directly
to
the
lungs
the
same
treatment
is
therefore
necessary
as
in
the
previous
case
with
the
addition
if
the
friction
along
the
spine
has
failed
of
a
warm
bath
at
a
temperature
of
about
in
which
the
child
is
to
be
plunged
up
to
the
neck
first
cleansing
the
mouth
and
nostrils
of
the
mucus
that
might
interfere
with
the
free
passage
of
air
while
in
the
bath
the
friction
along
the
spine
is
to
be
continued
and
if
the
lungs
still
remain
unexpended
while
one
person
retains
the
child
in
an
inclined
position
in
the
water
another
should
insert
the
pipe
of
a
small
pair
of
bellows
into
one
nostril
and
while
the
month
is
closed
and
the
other
nostril
compressed
on
the
pipe
with
the
hand
of
the
assistant
the
lungs
are
to
be
slowly
inflated
by
steady
puffs
of
air
from
the
bellows
the
hand
being
removed
from
the
mouth
and
nose
after
each
inflation
and
placed
on
the
pit
of
the
stomach
and
by
a
steady
pressure
expelling
it
out
again
by
the
mouth
this
process
is
to
be
continued
steadily
inflating
and
expelling
the
air
from
the
lungs
till
with
a
sort
of
tremulous
leap
nature
takes
up
the
process
and
the
infant
begins
to
gasp
and
finally
to
cry
at
first
low
and
faint
but
with
every
gulp
of
air
increasing
in
length
and
strength
of
volume
when
it
is
to
be
removed
from
the
water
and
instantly
wrapped
all
but
the
face
and
mouth
in
a
flannel
sometimes
however
all
these
means
will
fail
in
effecting
an
utterance
from
the
child
which
will
lie
with
livid
lips
and
a
flaccid
body
every
few
minutes
opening
its
mouth
with
a
short
gasping
pant
and
then
subsiding
into
a
state
of
pulseless
inaction
lingering
probably
some
hours
till
the
spasmodic
pantings
growing
further
apart
it
ceases
to
exist
the
time
that
this
state
of
negative
vitality
will
linger
in
the
frame
of
an
infant
is
remarkable
and
even
when
all
the
previous
operations
though
have
proved
ineffectual
the
child
will
often
rally
from
the
simplest
of
means
the
application
of
dry
heat
when
removed
from
the
bath
place
three
or
four
hot
bricks
or
tiles
on
the
hearth
and
lay
the
child
loosely
folded
in
a
flannel
on
its
back
along
them
taking
care
that
there
is
but
one
fold
of
flannel
between
the
spine
and
heated
bricks
or
tiles
when
neither
of
these
articles
can
be
procured
put
a
few
clear
pieces
of
red
cinder
in
a
and
extend
the
child
in
the
same
manner
along
the
closed
lid
as
the
heat
gradually
diffuses
itself
over
the
spinal
marrow
the
child
that
was
dying
or
seemingly
dead
will
frequently
give
a
sudden
and
energetic
cry
succeeded
in
another
minute
by
a
long
and
vigorous
peal
making
up
in
volume
and
force
for
the
previous
delay
and
instantly
confirming
its
existence
by
every
effort
in
its
nature
with
these
two
exceptions
restored
by
the
means
we
have
pointed
out
to
the
functions
of
life
we
will
proceed
to
the
consideration
of
the
child
healthily
born
here
the
first
thing
that
meets
us
on
the
threshold
of
inquiry
and
what
is
often
between
mother
and
nurse
not
only
a
vexed
question
but
one
of
vexatious
import
is
the
of
the
child
the
mother
in
her
natural
anxiety
maintaining
that
her
infant
be
to
cause
it
to
cry
so
much
or
so
often
and
the
nurse
insisting
that
children
cry
and
that
nothing
is
the
matter
with
it
and
that
crying
does
good
and
is
indeed
an
especial
benefit
to
infancy
the
anxious
and
unfamiliar
mother
though
not
convinced
by
these
abstract
sayings
of
the
truth
or
wisdom
of
the
explanation
takes
both
for
granted
and
giving
the
nurse
credit
for
more
knowledge
and
experience
on
this
head
than
she
can
have
contentedly
resigns
herself
to
the
infliction
as
a
thing
necessary
to
be
endured
for
the
good
of
the
baby
but
thinking
it
at
the
same
time
an
extraordinary
instance
of
the
imperfectibility
of
nature
as
regards
the
human
infant
for
her
mind
wanders
to
what
she
has
observed
in
her
childhood
with
puppies
and
kittens
who
except
when
rudely
torn
from
their
nurse
seldom
give
utterance
to
any
complaining
we
undoubtedly
believe
that
crying
to
a
certain
extent
is
not
only
conducive
to
health
but
positively
necessary
to
the
full
development
and
physical
economy
of
the
infant
being
but
though
holding
this
opinion
we
are
far
from
believing
that
a
child
does
not
very
often
cry
from
pain
thirst
want
of
food
and
attention
to
its
personal
comfort
but
there
is
as
much
difference
in
the
tone
and
expression
of
a
child
cry
as
in
the
notes
of
an
adult
voice
and
the
mother
ear
will
not
be
long
in
discriminating
between
the
sharp
peevish
whine
of
irritation
and
fever
and
the
louder
intermitting
cry
that
characterizes
the
want
of
warmth
and
sleep
all
these
shades
of
expression
in
the
child
inarticulate
voice
every
nurse
understand
and
every
mother
will
soon
teach
herself
to
interpret
them
with
an
accuracy
equal
to
language
there
is
no
part
of
a
woman
duty
to
her
child
that
a
young
mother
should
so
soon
make
it
her
business
to
study
as
the
voice
of
her
infant
and
the
language
conveyed
in
its
cry
the
study
is
neither
hard
nor
difficult
a
close
attention
to
its
tone
and
the
expression
of
the
baby
features
are
the
two
most
important
points
demanding
attention
the
key
to
both
the
mother
will
find
in
her
own
heart
and
the
knowledge
of
her
success
in
the
comfort
and
smile
of
her
infant
we
have
two
reasons
both
strong
ones
for
urging
on
mothers
the
imperative
necessity
of
early
making
themselves
acquainted
with
the
nature
and
wants
of
their
child
the
first
that
when
left
to
the
entire
responsibility
of
the
baby
after
the
departure
of
the
nurse
she
may
be
able
to
undertake
her
new
duties
with
more
confidence
than
if
left
to
her
own
resources
and
mother
instinct
without
a
clue
to
guide
her
through
the
mysteries
of
those
calls
that
vibrate
through
every
nerve
of
her
nature
and
secondly
that
she
may
be
able
to
guard
her
child
from
the
nefarious
practices
of
unprincipled
nurses
who
while
calming
the
mother
mind
with
false
statements
as
to
the
character
of
the
cries
rather
than
lose
their
rest
or
devote
that
time
which
would
remove
the
cause
of
suffering
administer
behind
the
curtains
those
deadly
narcotics
which
while
stupefying
nature
into
sleep
insure
for
herself
a
night
of
many
unbroken
hours
such
nurses
as
have
not
the
hardihood
to
dose
their
infant
charges
are
often
full
of
other
schemes
to
still
that
constant
and
reproachful
cry
the
most
frequent
means
employed
for
this
purpose
is
giving
it
something
to
suck
something
easily
hid
from
the
mother
or
when
that
is
impossible
under
the
plea
of
keeping
it
warm
the
nurse
covers
it
in
her
lap
with
a
shawl
and
under
this
blind
surreptitiously
inserts
a
finger
between
the
parched
lips
which
possibly
moan
for
drink
and
under
this
inhuman
cheat
and
delusion
the
infant
is
pacified
till
nature
balked
of
its
desires
drops
into
a
troubled
sleep
these
are
two
of
our
reasons
for
impressing
upon
mothers
the
early
the
immediate
necessity
of
putting
themselves
sympathetically
in
communication
with
their
child
by
at
once
learning
its
hidden
language
as
a
delightful
task
we
must
strenuously
warn
all
mothers
on
no
account
to
allow
the
nurse
to
sleep
with
the
baby
never
herself
to
lay
down
with
it
by
her
side
for
a
night
rest
never
to
let
it
sleep
in
the
parents
bed
and
on
no
account
keep
it
longer
than
absolutely
necessary
confined
in
on
atmosphere
loaded
with
the
breath
of
many
adults
the
amount
of
required
by
an
infant
is
so
large
and
the
quantity
consumed
by
and
age
and
the
proportion
of
carbonic
acid
thrown
off
from
both
so
considerable
that
an
infant
breathing
the
same
air
can
not
possibly
carry
on
its
healthy
existence
while
deriving
its
vitality
from
so
corrupted
a
medium
this
objection
always
in
force
is
still
more
objectionable
at
when
doors
and
windows
are
closed
and
amounts
to
a
condition
of
poison
when
placed
between
two
adults
in
sleep
and
shut
in
by
and
when
in
addition
to
the
impurities
expired
from
the
lungs
we
remember
in
quiescence
and
sleep
how
large
a
portion
of
mephitic
gas
is
given
off
from
the
skin
mothers
in
the
fullness
of
their
affection
believe
there
is
no
harbour
sleeping
or
awake
where
their
infants
can
be
so
secure
from
all
possible
or
probable
danger
as
in
their
own
arms
yet
we
should
astound
our
readers
if
we
told
them
the
statistical
number
of
infants
who
in
despite
of
their
motherly
solicitude
and
love
are
annually
killed
unwittingly
by
such
parents
themselves
and
this
from
the
persistency
in
the
practice
we
are
so
strenuously
condemning
the
mother
frequently
on
awaking
discovers
the
baby
face
closely
impacted
between
her
bosom
and
her
arm
and
its
body
rigid
and
lifeless
or
else
so
enveloped
in
the
and
superincumbent
bedclothes
as
to
render
breathing
a
matter
of
physical
impossibility
in
such
cases
the
jury
in
general
returns
a
verdict
of
but
one
of
careless
suffocation
would
be
more
in
accordance
with
truth
and
justice
the
only
possible
excuse
that
can
be
urged
either
by
nurse
or
mother
for
this
culpable
practice
is
the
plea
of
imparting
warmth
to
the
infant
but
this
can
always
be
effected
by
an
extra
blanket
in
the
child
crib
or
if
the
weather
is
particularly
cold
by
a
bottle
of
hot
water
enveloped
in
flannel
and
placed
at
the
child
feet
while
all
the
objections
already
urged
as
derivable
from
animal
heat
imparted
by
actual
contact
are
entirely
obviated
there
is
another
evil
attending
the
sleeping
together
of
the
mother
and
infant
which
as
far
as
regards
the
latter
we
consider
quite
as
formidable
though
not
so
immediate
as
the
others
and
is
always
followed
by
more
or
less
of
mischief
to
the
mother
the
evil
we
now
allude
to
is
that
most
injurious
practice
of
letting
the
child
after
the
mother
has
a
custom
that
naturally
results
from
the
former
and
which
as
we
hare
already
said
is
injurious
to
both
mother
and
child
it
is
injurious
to
the
infant
by
allowing
it
without
control
to
imbibe
to
distension
a
fluid
sluggishly
secreted
and
deficient
in
those
vital
principles
which
the
want
of
mental
energy
and
of
the
sympathetic
appeals
of
the
child
on
the
mother
so
powerfully
produce
on
the
secreted
nutriment
while
the
mother
wakes
in
a
state
of
clammy
exhaustion
with
giddiness
dimness
of
sight
nausea
loss
of
appetite
and
a
dull
aching
pain
through
the
back
and
between
the
shoulders
in
fact
she
wakes
languid
and
unrefreshed
from
her
sleep
with
febrile
symptoms
and
hectic
flushes
caused
by
her
baby
vampire
who
while
dragging
from
her
her
health
and
strength
has
excited
in
itself
a
set
of
symptoms
directly
opposite
but
fraught
with
the
same
injurious
consequences
functional
derangement
the
milk
as
nature
has
placed
in
the
bosom
of
the
mother
the
natural
food
of
her
offspring
it
must
be
to
every
reflecting
woman
that
it
becomes
her
duty
to
study
as
far
as
lies
in
her
power
to
keep
that
reservoir
of
nourishment
in
as
pure
and
invigorating
a
condition
as
possible
for
she
must
remember
that
the
is
no
proof
of
the
of
this
aliment
the
mother
while
suckling
as
a
general
rule
should
avoid
all
sedentary
occupations
take
regular
exercise
keep
her
mind
as
lively
and
pleasingly
occupied
as
possible
especially
by
music
and
singing
her
diet
should
be
light
and
nutritious
with
a
proper
sufficiency
of
animal
food
and
of
that
kind
which
yields
the
largest
amount
of
nourishment
and
unless
the
digestion
is
naturally
strong
vegetables
and
fruit
should
form
a
very
small
proportion
of
the
general
dietary
and
such
preparations
as
broths
gruels
arrowroot
still
less
tapioca
or
pudding
made
with
several
eggs
may
be
taken
freely
but
all
slops
and
thin
potations
such
as
that
delusion
called
should
be
avoided
as
yielding
a
very
small
amount
of
nutriment
and
a
large
proportion
of
flatulence
all
purely
stimulants
should
be
avoided
as
much
as
possible
especially
spirits
unless
taken
for
some
special
object
and
that
medicinally
but
as
a
part
of
the
dietary
they
should
be
carefully
shunned
lactation
is
always
an
exhausting
process
and
as
the
child
increases
in
size
and
strength
the
drain
upon
the
mother
becomes
great
and
depressing
then
something
more
even
than
an
abundant
diet
is
required
to
keep
the
mind
and
body
up
to
a
standard
sufficiently
healthy
to
admit
of
a
constant
and
nutritious
secretion
being
performed
without
detriment
to
the
physical
integrity
of
the
mother
or
injury
to
the
child
who
imbibes
it
and
as
stimulants
are
inadmissible
if
not
positively
injurious
the
substitute
required
is
to
be
found
in
to
the
lady
accustomed
to
her
madeira
and
sherry
this
may
appear
a
very
vulgar
potation
for
a
delicate
young
mother
to
take
instead
of
the
more
subtle
and
condensed
elegance
of
wine
but
as
we
are
writing
from
experience
and
with
the
avowed
object
of
imparting
useful
facts
and
beneficial
remedies
to
our
readers
we
allow
no
social
distinctions
to
interfere
with
our
legitimate
object
we
have
already
said
that
the
suckling
mother
should
avoid
stimulants
especially
spirituous
ones
and
though
something
of
this
sort
is
absolutely
necessary
to
support
her
strength
during
the
exhausting
process
it
should
be
rather
of
a
than
of
a
stimulating
character
and
as
all
wines
contain
a
large
percentage
of
brandy
they
are
on
that
account
less
beneficial
than
the
pure
juice
of
the
fermented
grape
might
be
but
there
is
another
consideration
to
be
taken
into
account
on
this
subject
the
mother
has
not
only
to
think
of
herself
but
also
of
her
infant
now
wines
especially
port
wine
very
often
indeed
most
frequently
affect
the
baby
bowels
and
what
might
have
been
grateful
to
the
mother
becomes
thus
a
source
of
pain
and
irritation
to
the
child
afterwards
sherry
is
less
open
to
this
objection
than
other
wines
yet
still
very
frequently
does
influence
the
second
participator
or
the
child
whose
mother
has
taken
it
the
nine
or
twelve
months
a
woman
usually
suckles
must
be
to
some
extent
to
most
mothers
a
period
of
privation
and
penance
and
unless
she
is
deaf
to
the
cries
of
her
baby
and
insensible
to
its
kicks
and
plunges
and
will
not
see
in
such
muscular
evidences
the
griping
pains
that
rack
her
child
she
will
avoid
every
article
that
can
remotely
affect
the
little
being
who
draws
its
sustenance
from
her
she
will
see
that
the
babe
is
acutely
affected
by
all
that
in
any
way
influences
her
and
willingly
curtail
her
own
enjoyments
rather
than
see
her
infant
rendered
feverish
irritable
and
uncomfortable
as
the
best
tonic
then
and
the
most
efficacious
indirect
stimulant
that
a
mother
can
take
at
such
times
there
is
no
potation
equal
to
and
or
what
is
better
still
an
equal
part
of
porter
and
stout
ale
except
for
a
few
constitutions
is
too
subtle
and
too
sweet
generally
causing
acidity
or
heartburn
and
stout
alone
is
too
potent
to
admit
of
a
full
draught
from
its
proneness
to
affect
the
head
and
quantity
as
well
as
moderate
strength
is
required
to
make
the
draught
effectual
the
equal
mixture
therefore
of
stout
and
porter
yields
all
the
properties
desired
or
desirable
as
a
medicinal
agent
for
this
purpose
independently
of
its
invigorating
influence
on
the
constitution
exerts
a
marked
and
specific
effect
on
the
secretion
of
milk
more
powerful
in
exciting
an
abundant
supply
of
that
fluid
than
any
other
article
within
the
range
of
the
physician
art
and
in
cases
of
deficient
quantity
is
the
most
certain
speedy
and
the
healthiest
means
that
can
be
employed
to
insure
a
quick
and
abundant
flow
in
cases
where
malt
liquor
produces
flatulency
a
few
grains
of
the
carbonate
of
soda
may
advantageously
be
added
to
each
glass
immediately
before
drinking
which
will
have
the
effect
of
neutralizing
any
acidity
that
may
be
in
the
porter
at
the
time
and
will
also
prevent
its
with
the
stomach
the
quantity
to
be
taken
must
depend
upon
the
natural
strength
of
the
mother
the
age
and
demand
made
by
the
infant
on
the
parent
and
other
causes
but
the
amount
should
vary
from
to
pints
a
day
never
taking
less
than
half
a
pint
at
a
time
which
should
be
repeated
three
or
four
times
a
day
we
have
said
that
the
period
of
suckling
is
a
season
of
penance
to
the
mother
but
this
is
not
invariably
the
case
and
as
so
much
must
depend
upon
the
natural
strength
of
the
stomach
and
its
power
of
assimilating
all
kinds
of
food
into
healthy
it
is
impossible
to
define
exceptions
where
a
woman
feels
she
can
eat
any
kind
of
food
without
inconvenience
or
detriment
she
should
live
during
her
suckling
as
she
did
before
but
as
a
general
rule
we
are
bound
to
advise
all
mothers
to
abstain
from
such
articles
as
pickles
fruits
cucumbers
and
all
acid
and
slowly
digestible
foods
unless
they
wish
for
restless
nights
and
crying
infants
as
regards
exercise
and
amusement
we
would
certainly
neither
prohibit
a
mother
dancing
going
to
a
theatre
nor
even
from
attending
an
assembly
the
first
however
is
the
best
indoor
recreation
she
can
take
and
a
young
mother
will
do
well
to
often
amuse
herself
in
the
nursery
with
this
most
excellent
means
of
healthful
circulation
the
only
precaution
necessary
is
to
avoid
letting
the
child
suck
the
milk
that
has
lain
long
in
the
breast
or
is
heated
by
excessive
action
every
mother
who
can
should
be
provided
with
a
or
glass
tube
to
draw
off
the
superabundance
that
has
been
accumulating
in
her
absence
from
the
child
or
the
first
gush
excited
by
undue
exertion
the
subsequent
supply
of
milk
will
be
secreted
under
the
invigorating
influence
of
a
previous
healthy
stimulus
as
the
first
milk
that
is
secreted
contains
a
large
amount
of
the
saline
elements
and
is
thin
and
innutritious
it
is
most
admirably
adapted
for
the
purpose
nature
designed
it
to
fulfil
that
of
an
aperient
but
which
unfortunately
it
is
seldom
permitted
in
our
artificial
mode
of
living
to
perform
so
opposed
are
we
to
the
objectionable
plan
of
physicking
children
that
unless
for
positive
illness
we
would
much
rather
advise
that
medicine
should
be
administered
the
mother
for
the
first
eight
or
ten
weeks
of
its
existence
this
practice
which
few
mothers
will
object
to
is
easily
effected
by
the
parent
when
such
a
course
is
necessary
for
the
child
taking
either
a
dose
of
half
an
ounce
of
tasteless
salts
the
phosphate
of
soda
one
or
two
teaspoonfuls
of
magnesia
a
dose
of
lenitive
electuary
manna
or
any
mild
and
simple
aperient
which
almost
before
it
can
have
taken
effect
on
herself
will
exhibit
its
action
on
her
child
one
of
the
most
common
errors
that
mothers
fall
into
while
suckling
their
children
is
that
of
fancying
they
are
always
hungry
and
consequently
overfeeding
them
and
with
this
the
great
mistake
of
applying
the
child
to
the
breast
on
every
occasion
of
its
crying
without
investigating
the
cause
of
its
complaint
and
under
the
belief
that
it
wants
food
putting
the
nipple
into
its
crying
mouth
until
the
infant
turns
in
revulsion
and
petulance
from
what
it
should
accept
with
eagerness
and
joy
at
such
times
a
few
teaspoonfuls
of
water
slightly
chilled
will
often
instantly
pacify
a
crying
and
restless
child
who
has
turned
in
loathing
from
the
offered
breast
or
after
imbibing
a
few
drops
and
finding
it
not
what
nature
craved
throws
back
its
head
in
disgust
and
cries
more
petulantly
than
before
in
such
a
case
as
this
the
young
mother
grieved
at
her
baby
rejection
of
the
tempting
present
and
distressed
at
its
cries
and
in
terror
of
some
injury
over
and
over
ransacks
its
clothes
believing
some
insecure
pin
can
alone
be
the
cause
of
such
sharp
complaining
an
accident
that
from
her
own
care
in
dressing
however
is
seldom
or
ever
the
case
these
abrupt
cries
of
the
child
if
they
do
not
proceed
from
thirst
which
a
little
water
will
relieve
not
unfrequently
occur
from
some
unequal
pressure
a
fold
or
twist
in
the
roller
or
some
constriction
round
the
tender
body
if
this
is
suspected
the
mother
must
not
be
content
with
merely
slackening
the
strings
the
child
should
be
undressed
and
the
creases
and
folds
of
the
hot
skin
especially
those
about
the
thighs
and
groins
examined
to
see
that
no
powder
has
caked
and
becoming
hard
irritated
the
parts
the
violet
powder
should
be
dusted
freely
over
all
to
cool
the
skin
and
everything
put
on
fresh
and
smooth
if
such
precautions
have
not
afforded
relief
and
in
addition
to
the
crying
the
child
plunges
or
draws
up
its
legs
the
mother
may
be
assured
some
cause
of
irritation
exists
in
the
stomach
or
bowels
either
acidity
in
the
latter
or
distension
from
overfeeding
in
the
former
but
from
whichever
cause
the
child
should
be
opened
before
the
fire
and
a
heated
napkin
applied
all
over
the
abdomen
the
infant
being
occasionally
elevated
to
a
sitting
position
and
while
gently
jolted
on
the
knee
the
back
should
be
lightly
patted
with
the
hand
should
the
mother
have
any
reason
to
apprehend
that
the
of
inconvenience
proceeds
from
the
bladder
a
not
unfrequent
source
of
pain
the
napkin
is
to
be
dipped
in
hot
water
squeezed
out
and
immediately
applied
over
the
part
and
repeated
every
eight
or
ten
minutes
for
several
times
in
succession
either
till
the
natural
relief
is
afforded
or
a
cessation
of
pain
allows
of
its
discontinuance
the
pain
that
young
infants
often
suffer
and
the
crying
that
results
from
it
is
as
we
have
already
said
frequently
caused
by
the
mother
inconsiderately
overfeeding
her
child
and
is
produced
by
the
pain
of
distension
and
the
mechanical
pressure
of
a
larger
quantity
of
fluid
in
the
stomach
than
the
gastric
juice
can
convert
into
cheese
and
digest
some
children
are
stronger
in
the
enduring
power
of
the
stomach
than
others
and
get
rid
of
the
excess
by
vomiting
concluding
every
process
of
suckling
by
an
emission
of
milk
and
curd
such
children
are
called
by
nurses
thriving
children
and
generally
they
are
so
simply
because
their
digestion
is
good
and
they
have
the
power
of
expelling
with
impunity
that
superabundance
of
aliment
which
in
others
is
a
source
of
distension
flatulence
and
pain
the
length
of
time
an
infant
should
be
suckled
must
depend
much
on
the
health
and
strength
of
the
child
and
the
health
of
the
mother
and
the
quantity
and
quality
of
her
milk
though
when
all
circumstances
are
favourable
it
should
never
be
less
than
nor
exceed
months
but
perhaps
the
true
time
will
be
found
in
the
medium
between
both
but
of
this
we
may
be
sure
that
nature
never
ordained
a
child
to
live
on
suction
after
having
endowed
it
with
teeth
to
bite
and
to
grind
and
nothing
is
more
out
of
place
and
unseemly
than
to
hear
a
child
with
a
set
of
twenty
teeth
ask
for
the
breast
the
practice
of
protracted
is
hurtful
to
the
mother
by
keeping
up
an
and
after
the
proper
time
an
unhealthy
drain
on
her
system
while
the
child
either
derives
no
benefit
from
what
it
no
longer
requires
or
it
produces
a
positive
injury
on
its
constitution
after
the
period
when
nature
has
ordained
the
child
shall
live
by
other
means
the
secretion
of
milk
becomes
thin
and
deteriorated
showing
in
the
flabby
flesh
and
puny
features
of
the
child
both
its
loss
of
nutritious
properties
and
the
want
of
more
stimulating
aliment
though
we
have
said
that
twelve
months
is
about
the
medium
time
a
baby
should
be
suckled
we
by
no
means
wish
to
imply
that
a
child
should
be
fed
exclusively
on
milk
for
its
first
year
quite
the
reverse
the
infant
can
hardly
be
too
soon
made
independent
of
the
mother
thus
should
illness
assail
her
her
milk
fail
or
any
domestic
cause
abruptly
cut
off
the
natural
supply
the
child
having
been
annealed
to
an
artificial
diet
its
life
might
be
safely
carried
on
without
seeking
for
a
and
without
the
slightest
danger
to
its
system
the
advantage
to
the
mother
of
early
accustoming
the
child
to
artificial
food
is
as
considerable
to
herself
as
beneficial
to
her
infant
the
demand
on
her
physical
strength
in
the
first
instance
will
be
less
severe
and
exhausting
the
child
will
sleep
longer
on
a
less
rapidly
digestible
aliment
and
yield
to
both
more
quiet
nights
and
the
mother
will
be
more
at
liberty
to
go
out
for
business
or
pleasure
another
means
of
sustenance
being
at
hand
till
her
return
besides
these
advantages
by
a
judicious
blending
of
the
two
systems
of
feeding
the
infant
will
acquire
greater
constitutional
strength
so
that
if
attacked
by
sickness
or
disease
it
will
have
a
much
greater
chance
of
resisting
its
virulence
than
if
dependent
alone
on
the
mother
whose
milk
affected
by
fatigue
and
the
natural
anxiety
of
the
parent
for
her
offspring
is
at
such
a
time
neither
good
in
its
properties
nor
likely
to
be
beneficial
to
the
patient
all
that
we
have
further
to
say
on
suckling
is
an
advice
to
mothers
that
if
they
wish
to
keep
a
sound
and
unchapped
nipple
and
possibly
avoid
what
is
called
a
broken
breast
never
to
put
it
up
with
a
wet
nipple
but
always
to
have
a
soft
handkerchief
in
readiness
and
the
moment
that
delicate
part
is
drawn
from
the
child
mouth
to
dry
it
carefully
of
the
milk
and
saliva
that
moisten
it
and
further
to
make
a
practice
of
suckling
from
each
breast
alternately
dress
and
dressing
washing
as
respects
the
dress
and
dressing
of
a
infant
or
of
a
child
in
arms
during
any
stage
of
its
nursing
there
are
few
women
who
will
require
us
to
give
them
guidance
or
directions
for
their
instruction
and
though
a
few
hints
on
the
subject
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
yet
most
women
intuitively
take
to
a
baby
and
with
a
small
amount
of
experience
are
able
to
perform
all
the
little
offices
necessary
to
its
comfort
and
cleanliness
with
ease
and
completeness
we
shall
therefore
on
this
delicate
subject
hold
our
peace
and
only
from
afar
at
what
we
would
leaving
our
suggestions
to
be
approved
or
rejected
according
as
they
chime
with
the
judgment
and
the
apprehension
of
our
motherly
readers
in
these
days
of
intelligence
there
are
few
ladies
who
have
not
in
all
probability
seen
the
manner
in
which
the
indian
squaw
the
aborigines
of
polynesia
and
even
the
lapp
and
esquimaux
strap
down
their
baby
on
a
board
and
by
means
of
a
loop
suspend
it
to
the
bough
of
a
tree
hang
it
up
to
the
rafters
of
the
hut
or
on
travel
dangle
it
on
their
backs
outside
the
domestic
implements
which
as
the
slave
of
her
master
man
the
wronged
but
uncomplaining
woman
carries
in
order
that
her
lord
may
march
in
unhampered
freedom
cruel
and
confining
as
this
system
of
backboard
dressing
may
seem
to
our
modern
notions
of
freedom
and
exercise
it
is
positively
less
irksome
less
confining
and
infinitely
less
prejudicial
to
health
than
the
mummying
of
children
by
our
grandmothers
a
hundred
ay
fifty
years
ago
for
what
with
rollers
bandages
an
infant
had
as
many
girths
and
strings
to
keep
head
limbs
and
body
in
one
exact
position
as
a
ship
has
halyards
much
of
this
indeed
we
may
say
all
has
been
abolished
but
still
the
child
is
far
from
being
dressed
loosely
enough
and
we
shall
never
be
satisfied
till
the
abominable
use
of
the
is
avoided
in
an
infant
dressing
and
a
texture
made
for
all
the
under
garments
of
a
child
of
a
cool
and
elastic
material
the
manner
in
which
an
infant
is
encircled
in
a
bandage
called
the
roller
as
if
it
had
fractured
ribs
compressing
those
organs
that
living
on
suction
must
be
for
the
health
of
the
child
to
a
certain
degree
distended
to
obtain
sufficient
aliment
from
the
fluid
imbibed
is
perfectly
preposterous
our
humanity
as
well
as
our
duty
calls
upon
us
at
once
to
abrogate
and
discountenance
by
every
means
in
our
power
instead
of
the
process
of
washing
and
dressing
being
made
as
with
the
adult
a
refreshment
and
comfort
it
is
by
the
dawdling
manner
in
which
it
is
performed
the
multiplicity
of
things
used
and
the
perpetual
change
of
position
of
the
infant
to
adjust
its
complicated
clothing
rendered
an
operation
of
positive
irritation
and
annoyance
we
therefore
entreat
all
mothers
to
regard
this
subject
in
its
true
light
and
study
to
the
utmost
simplicity
in
dress
and
dispatch
in
the
process
children
do
not
so
much
cry
from
the
washing
as
from
the
irritation
caused
by
the
frequent
change
of
position
in
which
they
are
placed
the
number
of
times
they
are
turned
on
their
face
on
their
back
and
on
their
side
by
the
manipulations
demanded
by
the
multiplicity
of
articles
to
be
fitted
tacked
and
carefully
adjusted
on
their
bodies
what
mother
ever
found
her
girl
of
six
or
seven
stand
quiet
while
she
was
curling
her
hair
how
many
times
nightly
has
she
not
to
reprove
her
for
not
standing
still
during
the
process
it
is
the
same
with
the
unconscious
infant
who
can
not
bear
to
be
moved
about
and
who
has
no
sooner
grown
reconciled
to
one
position
than
it
is
forced
reluctantly
into
another
it
is
true
in
one
instance
the
child
has
intelligence
to
guide
it
and
in
the
other
not
but
the
in
both
instances
resent
coercion
and
a
child
can
not
be
too
little
handled
on
this
account
alone
and
for
the
moment
setting
health
and
comfort
out
of
the
question
we
beg
mothers
to
simplify
their
dress
as
much
as
possible
and
not
only
to
put
on
as
little
as
is
absolutely
necessary
but
to
make
that
as
simple
in
its
contrivance
and
adjustment
as
it
will
admit
of
to
avoid
rollers
girths
and
everything
that
can
impede
or
confine
the
natural
expansion
of
the
digestive
organs
on
the
due
performance
of
whose
functions
the
child
lives
thrives
and
develops
its
physical
being
rearing
by
hand
articles
necessary
and
how
to
use
them
preparation
of
advantages
of
rearing
by
hand
as
we
do
not
for
a
moment
wish
to
be
thought
an
advocate
for
an
artificial
in
preference
to
the
natural
course
of
rearing
children
we
beg
our
renders
to
understand
us
perfectly
on
this
head
all
we
desire
to
prove
is
the
fact
that
a
child
be
brought
up
as
well
on
a
spoon
dietary
as
the
best
example
to
be
found
of
those
reared
on
the
breast
having
more
strength
indeed
from
the
more
nutritious
food
on
which
it
lives
it
will
be
thus
less
liable
to
infectious
diseases
and
more
capable
of
resisting
the
virulence
of
any
danger
that
may
attack
it
and
without
in
any
way
depreciating
the
nutriment
of
its
natural
food
we
wish
to
impress
on
the
mother
mind
that
there
are
many
cases
of
infantine
debility
which
might
eventuate
in
rickets
curvature
of
the
spine
or
mesenteric
disease
where
the
addition
to
or
total
substitution
of
an
artificial
and
more
stimulating
aliment
would
not
only
give
tone
and
strength
to
the
constitution
but
at
the
same
time
render
the
employment
of
mechanical
means
totally
unnecessary
and
finally
though
we
would
never
where
the
mother
had
the
strength
to
suckle
her
child
supersede
the
breast
we
would
insist
on
making
it
a
rule
to
accustom
the
child
as
early
as
possible
to
the
use
of
an
artificial
diet
not
only
that
it
may
acquire
more
vigour
to
help
it
over
the
ills
of
childhood
but
that
in
the
absence
of
the
mother
it
might
not
miss
the
maternal
sustenance
and
also
for
the
parent
sake
that
should
the
milk
from
any
cause
become
vitiated
or
suddenly
cease
the
child
can
be
made
over
to
the
bottle
and
the
spoon
without
the
slightest
apprehension
of
hurtful
consequences
to
those
persons
unacquainted
with
the
system
or
who
may
have
been
erroneously
informed
on
the
matter
the
rearing
of
a
child
by
hand
may
seem
surrounded
by
innumerable
difficulties
and
a
large
amount
of
personal
trouble
and
anxiety
to
the
nurse
or
mother
who
undertakes
the
duty
this
however
is
a
fallacy
in
every
respect
except
as
regards
the
fact
of
preparing
the
food
but
even
this
extra
amount
of
work
by
adopting
the
course
we
shall
lay
down
may
be
reduced
to
a
very
small
sum
of
inconvenience
and
as
respects
anxiety
the
only
thing
calling
for
care
is
the
display
of
judgment
in
the
preparation
of
the
food
the
articles
required
for
the
purpose
of
feeding
an
infant
are
a
with
its
pan
and
lid
to
keep
the
food
warm
a
with
a
prepared
teat
and
a
small
pap
saucepan
for
use
by
day
of
the
lamp
we
need
hardly
speak
most
mothers
being
acquainted
with
its
operation
but
to
those
to
whom
it
is
unknown
we
may
observe
that
the
flame
from
the
floating
rushlight
heats
the
water
in
the
reservoir
above
in
which
the
covered
pan
that
contains
the
food
floats
keeping
it
at
such
a
heat
that
when
thinned
by
milk
it
will
be
of
a
temperature
suitable
for
immediate
use
though
many
kinds
of
have
been
lately
invented
and
some
mounted
with
nipples
the
common
glass
bottle
with
the
calf
teat
is
equal
in
cleanliness
and
utility
to
any
besides
the
nipple
put
into
the
child
mouth
is
so
white
and
natural
in
appearance
that
no
child
taken
from
the
breast
will
refuse
it
the
black
artificial
ones
of
caoutchouc
or
are
unnatural
the
prepared
teats
can
be
obtained
at
any
chemist
and
as
they
are
kept
in
spirits
they
will
require
a
little
soaking
in
warm
water
and
gentle
washing
before
being
tied
securely
by
means
of
fine
twine
round
the
neck
of
the
bottle
just
sufficient
being
left
projecting
for
the
child
to
grasp
freely
in
its
lips
for
if
left
the
full
length
or
over
long
it
will
be
drawn
too
far
into
the
mouth
and
possibly
make
the
infant
heave
when
once
properly
adjusted
the
nipple
need
never
be
removed
till
replaced
by
a
new
one
which
will
hardly
be
necessary
oftener
than
once
a
fortnight
though
with
care
one
will
last
for
several
weeks
the
should
be
thoroughly
washed
and
cleaned
every
day
and
always
rinsed
out
before
and
after
using
it
the
warm
water
being
squeezed
through
the
nipple
to
wash
out
any
particles
of
food
that
might
lodge
in
the
aperture
and
become
sour
the
teat
can
always
be
kept
white
and
soft
by
turning
the
end
of
the
bottle
when
not
in
use
into
a
narrow
jug
containing
water
taking
care
to
dry
it
first
and
then
to
warm
it
by
drawing
the
food
through
before
putting
it
into
the
child
mouth
food
and
its
preparation
the
articles
generally
employed
as
food
for
infants
consist
of
arrowroot
bread
flour
baked
flour
prepared
groats
farinaceous
food
biscuits
and
semolina
or
manna
croup
as
it
is
otherwise
called
which
like
tapioca
is
the
prepared
pith
of
certain
vegetable
substances
of
this
list
the
least
efficacious
though
perhaps
the
most
believed
in
is
arrowroot
which
only
as
a
mere
agent
for
change
and
then
only
for
a
very
short
time
should
ever
be
employed
as
a
means
of
diet
to
infancy
or
childhood
it
is
a
thin
flatulent
and
innutritious
food
and
incapable
of
supporting
infantine
life
with
energy
bread
though
the
universal
with
the
labouring
poor
where
the
infant
stomach
and
digestive
powers
are
a
reflex
in
miniature
of
the
father
should
never
be
given
to
an
infant
under
three
months
and
even
then
however
finely
beaten
up
and
smoothly
made
is
a
very
questionable
diet
flour
when
well
boiled
though
infinitely
better
than
arrowroot
is
still
only
a
kind
of
fermentative
paste
that
counteracts
its
own
good
by
and
flatulence
baked
flour
when
cooked
into
a
pale
brown
mass
and
finely
powdered
makes
a
far
superior
food
to
the
others
and
may
be
considered
as
a
very
useful
diet
especially
for
a
change
prepared
groats
may
be
classed
with
arrowroot
and
raw
flour
as
being
innutritious
the
articles
that
now
follow
in
our
list
are
all
good
and
such
as
we
could
with
conscience
and
safety
trust
to
for
the
health
and
development
of
any
child
whatever
we
may
observe
in
this
place
that
an
occasional
change
in
the
character
of
the
food
is
highly
desirable
both
as
regards
the
health
and
benefit
of
the
child
and
though
the
interruption
should
only
last
for
a
day
the
change
will
be
advantageous
the
packets
sold
as
farinaceous
food
are
unquestionably
the
best
aliment
that
can
be
given
from
the
first
to
a
baby
and
may
be
continued
with
the
exception
of
an
occasional
change
without
alteration
of
the
material
till
the
child
is
able
to
take
its
regular
meals
of
animal
and
vegetable
food
some
infants
are
so
constituted
as
to
require
a
frequent
and
total
change
in
their
system
of
living
seeming
to
thrive
for
a
certain
time
on
any
food
given
to
them
but
if
persevered
in
too
long
declining
in
bulk
and
appearance
as
rapidly
as
they
had
previously
progressed
in
such
cases
the
food
should
be
immediately
changed
and
when
that
which
appeared
to
agree
best
with
the
child
is
resumed
it
should
be
altered
in
its
quality
and
perhaps
in
its
consistency
for
the
farinaceous
food
there
are
directions
with
each
packet
containing
instructions
for
the
making
but
whatever
the
food
employed
is
enough
should
be
made
at
once
to
last
the
day
and
night
at
first
about
a
pint
basinful
but
as
the
child
advances
a
quart
will
hardly
be
too
much
in
all
cases
let
the
food
boil
a
sufficient
time
constantly
stirring
and
taking
every
precaution
that
it
does
not
get
burnt
in
which
case
it
is
on
no
account
to
be
used
the
food
should
always
be
made
with
water
the
whole
sweetened
at
once
and
of
such
a
consistency
that
when
poured
out
and
it
has
had
time
to
cool
it
will
cut
with
the
firmness
of
a
pudding
or
custard
one
or
two
spoonfuls
are
to
be
put
into
the
pap
saucepan
and
stood
on
the
hob
till
the
heat
has
softened
it
when
enough
milk
is
to
be
added
and
carefully
mixed
with
the
food
till
the
whole
has
the
consistency
of
ordinary
cream
it
is
then
to
be
poured
into
the
and
the
food
having
been
drawn
through
to
warm
the
nipple
it
is
to
be
placed
in
the
child
mouth
for
the
first
month
or
more
half
a
bottleful
will
be
quite
enough
to
give
the
infant
at
one
time
but
as
the
child
grows
it
will
be
necessary
not
only
to
increase
the
quantity
given
at
each
time
but
also
gradually
to
make
its
food
more
consistent
and
after
the
third
month
to
add
an
egg
to
every
pint
basin
of
food
made
at
night
the
mother
puts
the
food
into
the
covered
pan
of
her
lamp
instead
of
the
saucepan
that
is
enough
for
one
supply
and
having
lighted
the
rush
she
will
find
on
the
waking
of
her
child
the
food
sufficiently
hot
to
bear
the
cooling
addition
of
the
milk
but
whether
night
or
day
the
same
food
should
never
be
heated
twice
and
what
the
child
leaves
should
be
thrown
away
the
biscuit
powder
is
used
in
the
same
manner
as
the
farinaceous
food
and
both
prepared
much
after
the
fashion
of
making
starch
but
when
or
the
whole
biscuit
are
employed
they
require
soaking
in
cold
water
for
some
time
previous
to
boiling
the
biscuit
or
biscuits
are
then
to
be
slowly
boiled
in
as
much
water
as
will
when
thoroughly
soft
allow
of
their
being
beaten
by
a
fork
into
a
fine
smooth
and
even
pulp
and
which
when
poured
into
a
basin
and
become
cold
will
cut
out
like
a
custard
if
two
large
biscuits
have
been
so
treated
and
the
child
is
six
or
seven
months
old
beat
up
two
eggs
sufficient
sugar
to
properly
sweeten
it
and
about
a
pint
of
skim
milk
pour
this
on
the
beaten
biscuit
in
the
saucepan
stirring
constantly
boil
for
about
five
minutes
pour
into
a
basin
and
use
when
cold
in
the
same
manner
as
the
other
this
makes
an
admirable
food
at
once
nutritious
and
strengthening
when
or
rusks
are
used
the
quantity
of
the
egg
may
be
reduced
or
altogether
omitted
semolina
or
manna
croup
being
in
little
hard
grains
like
a
fine
must
be
boiled
for
some
time
and
the
milk
sugar
and
egg
added
to
it
on
the
fire
and
boiled
for
a
few
minutes
longer
and
when
cold
used
as
the
other
preparations
many
persons
entertain
a
belief
that
cow
milk
is
hurtful
to
infants
and
consequently
refrain
from
giving
it
but
this
is
a
very
great
mistake
for
both
sugar
and
milk
should
form
a
large
portion
of
every
meal
an
infant
takes
teething
and
convulsions
fits
the
consequence
of
dentition
and
how
to
be
the
number
and
order
of
the
teeth
and
manner
in
which
they
are
first
and
second
set
about
three
months
after
birth
the
infant
troubles
may
be
said
to
begin
teeth
commence
forming
in
the
gums
causing
pain
and
irritation
in
the
mouth
and
which
but
for
the
saliva
it
causes
to
flow
so
abundantly
would
be
attended
with
very
serious
consequences
at
the
same
time
the
mother
frequently
relaxes
in
the
punctuality
of
the
regimen
imposed
on
her
and
taking
some
unusual
or
different
food
excites
diarrhoea
or
irritation
in
her
child
stomach
which
not
unfrequently
results
in
a
rash
on
the
skin
or
slight
febrile
symptoms
which
if
not
subdued
in
their
outset
superinduce
some
more
serious
form
of
infantine
disease
but
as
a
general
rule
the
teeth
are
the
primary
cause
of
much
of
the
child
sufferings
in
consequence
of
the
state
of
nervous
and
functional
irritation
into
which
the
system
is
thrown
by
their
formation
and
progress
out
of
the
jaw
and
through
the
gums
we
propose
beginning
this
branch
of
our
subject
with
that
most
fertile
source
of
an
infant
suffering
teething
that
this
subject
may
he
better
understood
by
the
nurse
and
mother
and
the
reason
of
the
constitutional
disturbance
that
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
is
experienced
by
all
infants
may
be
made
intelligible
to
those
who
have
the
care
of
children
we
shall
commence
by
giving
a
brief
account
of
the
formation
of
the
teeth
the
age
at
which
they
appear
in
the
mouth
and
the
order
in
which
they
pierce
the
gums
the
organs
of
mastication
in
the
adult
consist
of
distinct
teeth
in
either
jaw
being
in
fact
a
double
set
the
teeth
are
divided
into
incisors
canine
first
and
second
grinders
and
molars
but
in
childhood
the
complement
or
first
set
consists
of
only
twenty
and
these
only
make
their
appearance
as
the
development
of
the
frame
indicates
the
requirement
of
a
different
kind
of
food
for
the
support
of
the
system
at
birth
some
of
the
teeth
are
found
in
the
cavities
of
the
jaw
in
a
very
small
and
rudimentary
form
but
this
is
by
no
means
universal
about
the
third
month
the
jaws
which
are
hollow
and
divided
into
separate
cells
begin
to
expand
making
room
for
the
slowly
developing
teeth
which
arranged
for
beauty
and
economy
of
space
lengthwise
gradually
turn
their
tops
upwards
piercing
the
gum
by
their
edges
which
being
sharp
assist
in
cutting
a
passage
through
the
soft
parts
there
is
no
particular
period
at
which
children
cut
their
teeth
some
being
remarkably
early
and
others
equally
late
the
earliest
age
that
we
have
ever
ourselves
known
as
a
reliable
fact
was
such
peculiarities
are
generally
hereditary
and
as
in
this
case
common
to
a
whole
family
the
two
extremes
are
probably
represented
by
six
and
sixteen
months
pain
and
drivelling
are
the
usual
but
by
no
means
the
general
indications
of
teething
about
the
sixth
month
the
gums
become
tense
and
swollen
presenting
a
red
shiny
appearance
while
the
salivary
glands
pour
out
an
unusual
quantity
of
saliva
after
a
time
a
white
line
or
round
spot
is
observed
on
the
top
of
one
part
of
the
gums
and
the
sharp
edge
of
the
tooth
may
be
felt
beneath
if
the
finger
is
gently
pressed
on
the
part
through
these
white
spots
the
teeth
burst
their
way
in
the
following
order
two
incisors
in
the
lower
jaw
are
first
cut
though
in
general
some
weeks
elapse
between
the
appearance
of
the
first
and
the
advent
of
the
second
the
next
teeth
cut
are
the
four
incisors
of
the
upper
jaw
the
next
in
order
are
the
remaining
two
incisors
of
the
bottom
one
on
each
side
then
two
top
and
two
bottom
on
each
side
but
not
joining
the
incisors
and
lastly
about
the
eighteenth
or
twentieth
month
the
four
eye
teeth
filling
up
the
space
left
between
the
side
teeth
and
the
incisors
thus
completing
the
infant
set
of
sixteen
sometimes
at
the
same
period
but
more
frequently
some
months
later
four
more
double
teeth
slowly
make
their
appearance
one
on
each
side
of
each
jaw
completing
the
entire
series
of
the
child
first
set
of
twenty
teeth
it
is
asserted
that
a
child
while
cutting
its
teeth
should
either
dribble
excessively
vomit
after
every
meal
or
be
greatly
relaxed
though
one
or
other
or
all
of
these
at
once
may
attend
a
case
of
teething
it
by
no
means
follows
that
any
one
of
them
should
accompany
this
process
of
nature
though
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
where
the
pain
consequent
on
the
unyielding
state
of
the
gums
and
the
firmness
of
the
skin
that
covers
the
tooth
is
severe
a
copious
discharge
of
saliva
acts
beneficially
in
saving
the
head
and
also
in
guarding
the
child
from
those
dangerous
attacks
of
fits
to
which
many
children
in
their
teething
are
liable
that
generally
indicate
the
cutting
of
teeth
in
addition
to
the
inflamed
and
swollen
state
of
the
gums
and
increased
flow
of
saliva
are
the
restless
and
peevish
state
of
the
child
the
hands
being
thrust
into
the
mouth
and
the
evident
pleasure
imparted
by
rubbing
the
finger
or
nail
gently
along
the
gum
the
lips
are
often
excoriated
and
the
functions
of
the
stomach
or
bowels
are
out
of
order
in
severe
cases
occurring
in
unhealthy
or
scrofulous
children
there
are
from
the
first
considerable
fever
disturbed
sleep
fretfulness
diarrhoea
rolling
of
the
eyes
convulsive
startings
laborious
breathing
coma
or
unnatural
sleep
ending
unless
the
head
is
quickly
relieved
in
death
the
in
all
cases
of
painful
teething
is
remarkably
simple
and
consists
in
keeping
the
body
cool
by
mild
aperient
medicines
allaying
the
irritation
in
the
gums
by
friction
with
a
rough
ivory
ring
or
a
stale
crust
of
broad
and
when
the
head
lungs
or
any
organ
is
overloaded
or
unduly
excited
to
use
the
hot
bath
and
by
throwing
the
body
into
a
perspiration
equalize
the
circulation
and
relieve
the
system
from
the
danger
of
a
fatal
termination
besides
these
there
is
another
means
but
that
must
be
employed
by
a
medical
man
namely
scarifying
the
gums
an
operation
always
safe
and
which
when
judiciously
performed
and
at
a
critical
opportunity
will
often
snatch
the
child
from
the
grasp
of
death
there
are
few
subjects
on
which
mothers
have
often
formed
such
strong
and
mistaken
opinions
as
on
that
of
lancing
an
infant
gums
some
rather
seeing
their
child
go
into
fits
and
by
the
unrelieved
irritation
endangering
inflammation
of
the
brain
water
on
the
head
rickets
and
other
lingering
affections
than
permit
the
surgeon
to
afford
instant
relief
by
cutting
through
the
hard
skin
which
like
a
bladder
over
the
stopper
of
a
bottle
effectually
confines
the
tooth
to
the
socket
and
prevents
it
piercing
the
soft
spongy
substance
of
the
gum
this
prejudice
is
a
great
error
as
we
shall
presently
show
for
so
far
from
hurting
the
child
there
is
nothing
that
will
so
soon
convert
an
infant
tears
into
smiles
as
scarifying
the
gums
in
painful
teething
that
is
if
effectually
done
and
the
skin
of
the
tooth
be
divided
though
teething
is
a
natural
function
and
to
an
infant
in
perfect
health
should
be
unproductive
of
pain
yet
in
general
it
is
not
only
a
fertile
cause
of
suffering
but
often
a
source
of
alarm
and
danger
the
former
from
irritation
in
the
stomach
and
bowels
deranging
the
whole
economy
of
the
system
and
the
latter
from
coma
and
fits
that
may
excite
alarm
in
severe
cases
and
the
danger
that
eventuates
in
some
instances
from
organic
disease
of
the
head
or
spinal
marrow
we
shall
say
nothing
in
this
place
of
rickets
or
water
on
the
head
which
are
frequent
results
of
dental
irritation
but
proceed
to
finish
our
remarks
on
the
treatment
of
teething
though
strongly
advocating
the
lancing
of
the
gums
in
teething
and
when
there
are
any
severe
yet
it
should
never
be
needlessly
done
or
before
being
satisfied
that
the
tooth
is
fully
formed
and
is
out
of
the
socket
and
under
the
gum
when
assured
on
these
points
the
gum
should
be
cut
lengthwise
and
from
the
top
of
the
gum
downwards
to
the
tooth
in
an
horizontal
direction
thus
and
for
about
half
an
inch
in
length
the
operation
is
then
to
be
repeated
in
a
transverse
direction
cutting
across
the
gum
in
the
centre
of
the
first
incision
and
forming
a
cross
thus
the
object
of
this
double
incision
is
to
insure
a
retraction
of
the
cut
parts
and
leave
an
open
way
for
the
tooth
to
start
from
an
advantage
not
to
be
obtained
when
only
one
incision
is
made
for
unless
the
tooth
immediately
follows
the
lancing
the
opening
reunites
and
the
operation
has
to
be
repeated
that
this
operation
is
very
little
or
not
at
all
painful
is
evidenced
by
the
suddenness
with
which
the
infant
falls
asleep
after
the
lancing
and
awakes
in
apparently
perfect
health
though
immediately
before
the
use
of
the
the
child
may
have
been
shrieking
or
in
convulsions
convulsions
or
infantine
fits
from
their
birth
till
after
teething
infants
are
more
or
less
subject
or
liable
to
sudden
fits
which
often
without
any
assignable
cause
will
attack
the
child
in
a
moment
and
while
in
the
arms
and
which
according
to
their
frequency
and
the
age
and
strength
of
the
infant
are
either
slight
or
dangerous
whatever
may
have
been
the
remote
cause
the
immediate
one
is
some
irritation
of
the
nervous
system
causing
convulsions
or
an
effusion
to
the
head
inducing
coma
in
the
first
instance
the
infant
cries
out
with
a
quick
short
scream
rolls
up
its
eyes
arches
its
body
backwards
its
arms
become
bent
and
fixed
and
the
fingers
parted
the
lips
and
eyelids
assume
a
dusky
leaden
colour
while
the
face
remains
pale
and
the
eyes
open
glassy
or
staring
this
condition
may
or
may
not
be
attended
with
muscular
twitchings
of
the
mouth
and
convulsive
plunges
of
the
arms
the
fit
generally
lasts
from
one
to
three
minutes
when
the
child
recovers
with
a
sigh
and
the
relaxation
of
the
body
in
the
other
case
the
infant
is
attacked
at
once
with
total
insensibility
and
relaxation
of
the
limbs
coldness
of
the
body
and
suppressed
breathing
the
eyes
when
open
being
dilated
and
presenting
a
dim
glistening
appearance
the
infant
appearing
for
the
moment
to
be
dead
first
step
in
either
case
is
to
immerse
the
child
in
a
hot
bath
up
to
the
chin
or
if
sufficient
hot
water
can
not
be
procured
to
cover
the
body
make
a
of
what
can
be
obtained
and
while
the
left
hand
supports
the
child
in
a
sitting
or
recumbent
position
with
the
right
scoop
up
the
water
and
run
it
over
the
chest
of
the
patient
when
sufficient
water
can
be
obtained
the
spine
should
be
briskly
rubbed
while
in
the
bath
when
this
can
not
be
done
lay
the
child
on
the
knees
and
with
the
fingers
dipped
in
brandy
rub
the
whole
length
of
the
spine
vigorously
for
two
or
three
minutes
and
when
restored
to
consciousness
give
occasionally
a
teaspoonful
of
weak
brandy
and
water
or
wine
and
water
an
hour
after
the
bath
it
may
be
necessary
to
give
an
aperient
powder
possibly
also
to
repeat
the
dose
for
once
or
twice
every
three
hours
in
which
case
the
following
prescription
is
to
be
employed
take
of
powdered
scammony
grains
grey
powder

antimonial
powder

divide
into
four
powders
and

to
fifteen
drops
of

either
beverage
thrush
and
its
treatment
this
is
a
disease
to
which
infants
are
peculiarly
subject
and
in
whom
alone
it
may
be
said
to
be
a
disease
for
when
thrush
shows
itself
in
adult
or
advanced
life
it
is
not
as
a
disease
proper
but
only
as
a
symptom
or
accessory
of
some
other
ailment
generally
of
a
chronic
character
and
should
no
more
be
classed
as
a
separate
affection
than
the
petechae
or
spots
that
appear
in
malignant
measles
may
be
considered
a
distinct
affection
thrush
is
a
disease
of
the
follicles
of
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
alimentary
canal
whereby
there
are
formed
small
vesicles
or
bladders
filled
with
a
thick
mucous
secretion
which
bursting
discharge
their
contents
and
form
minute
ulcers
in
the
centre
of
each
vessel
to
make
this
formal
but
unavoidable
description
intelligible
we
must
beg
the
reader
patience
while
we
briefly
explain
terms
that
may
appear
to
many
so
unmeaning
and
make
the
pathology
of
thrush
fully
familiar
the
whole
digestive
canal
of
which
the
stomach
and
bowels
are
only
a
part
is
covered
from
the
lips
eyes
and
ears
downwards
with
a
thin
glairy
tissue
like
the
skin
that
lines
the
inside
of
an
egg
called
the
mucous
membrane
this
membrane
is
dotted
all
over
in
a
state
of
health
by
imperceptible
points
called
follicles
through
which
the
saliva
or
mucous
secreted
by
the
membrane
is
poured
out
these
follicles
or
little
glands
then
becoming
enlarged
and
filled
with
a
congealed
fluid
constitute
thrush
in
its
first
stage
and
when
the
child
lips
and
mouth
appear
a
mass
of
small
pearls
then
as
these
break
and
discharge
the
second
stage
or
that
of
ulceration
sets
in
thrush
is
generally
preceded
by
considerable
irritation
by
the
child
crying
and
fretting
showing
more
than
ordinary
redness
of
the
lips
and
nostrils
hot
fetid
breath
with
relaxed
bowels
and
dark
feculent
evacuations
the
water
is
scanty
and
whilst
considerable
difficulty
in
swallowing
and
much
thirst
are
the
other
symptoms
which
a
careful
observation
of
the
little
patient
makes
manifest
the
situation
and
character
of
thrush
show
at
once
that
the
cause
is
some
irritation
of
the
mucous
membrane
and
can
proceed
only
from
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
food
before
weaning
this
must
be
looked
for
in
the
mother
and
the
condition
of
the
milk
after
that
time
in
the
crude
and
indigestible
nature
of
the
food
given
in
either
case
this
exciting
cause
of
the
disease
must
be
at
once
stopped
when
it
proceeds
from
the
mother
it
is
always
best
to
begin
by
physicking
the
infant
through
the
parent
that
is
to
say
let
the
parent
first
take
the
medicine
which
will
sufficiently
affect
the
child
through
the
milk
this
plan
has
the
double
object
of
benefiting
the
patient
and
at
the
same
time
correcting
the
state
of
the
mother
and
improving
the
condition
of
her
milk
in
the
other
case
when
the
child
is
being
fed
by
hand
then
proceed
by
totally
altering
the
style
of
aliment
given
and
substituting
farinaceous
food
custards
and
puddings
as
an
aperient
medicine
for
the
mother
the
best
thing
she
can
take
is
a
of
carbonate
of
magnesia
once
or
twice
a
day
in
a
cup
of
cold
water
and
every
second
day
for
two
or
three
times
an
aperient
pill
as
the
thrush
extends
all
over
the
mouth
throat
stomach
and
bowels
the
irritation
to
the
child
from
such
an
extent
of
diseased
surface
is
proportionately
great
and
before
attempting
to
act
on
such
a
tender
surface
by
opening
medicine
the
better
plan
is
to
soothe
by
an
emollient
mixture
and
for
that
purpose
let
the
following
be
prepared
take
of
castor
oil
drachms
sugar
drachm
mucilage
or
powdered
gum
arabic
half
a
drachm
triturate
till
the
oil
is
incorporated
then
add
slowly
one
ounce
and
a
half
laudanum
ten
drops
half
a
teaspoonful
three
times
a
day
to
an
infant
from
one
to
two
years
old
a
teaspoonful
from
two
to
three
years
old
and
a
dessertspoonful
at
any
age
over
that
time
after
two
days
use
of
the
mixture
one
of
the
following
powders
should
be
given
twice
a
day
accompanied
with
one
dose
daily
of
the
mixture
grey
powder
grains
powdered
rhubarb
grains
scammony
grains
mix
divide
into
twelve
powders
for
one
year
eight
powders
from
one
to
two
and
six
powders
from
two
to
six
years
old
after
that
age
double
the
strength
by
giving
the
quantity
of
two
powders
at
once
it
is
sometimes
customary
to
apply
borax
and
honey
to
the
mouth
for
thrush
but
it
is
always
better
to
treat
the
disease
constitutionally
rather
than
locally
the
first
steps
therefore
to
be
adopted
are
to
remove
or
correct
the
exciting
cause
the
mother
milk
or
food
allay
irritation
by
a
warm
bath
and
the
mixture
followed
by
and
conjoined
with
the
powders
to
those
however
who
wish
to
try
the
honey
process
the
best
preparation
to
use
is
the
following
down
one
ounce
of
honey
with
two
drachms
of
tincture
of
myrrh
and
apply
it
to
the
lips
and
mouth
every
four
or
six
hours
it
is
a
popular
belief
and
one
most
devoutly
cherished
by
many
nurses
and
elderly
persons
that
everybody
must
at
some
time
of
their
life
between
birth
and
death
have
an
attack
of
thrush
and
if
not
in
infancy
or
prime
of
life
it
will
surely
attack
them
on
their
in
a
form
more
malignant
than
if
the
patient
had
been
affected
with
the
malady
earlier
the
black
thrush
with
which
they
are
then
reported
to
be
affected
being
in
all
probability
the
petechae
or
purple
spots
that
characterize
the
worst
form
and
often
the
last
stage
of
typhoid
fever
in
general
very
little
medicine
is
needed
in
this
disease
of
the
thrush
an
alterative
powder
or
a
little
magnesia
given
once
or
twice
being
all
with
the
warm
bath
that
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
is
needed
to
restore
the
mucous
membrane
to
health
as
thrush
is
caused
by
an
excess
of
heat
or
in
the
lining
membrane
of
the
stomach
and
bowels
whatever
will
counteract
this
state
by
throwing
the
heat
on
the
surface
must
materially
benefit
if
not
cure
the
disease
and
that
means
every
mother
has
at
hand
in
the
form
of
a
after
the
application
of
this
a
little
magnesia
to
correct
the
acidity
existing
along
the
surface
of
the
mucous
membrane
is
often
all
that
is
needed
to
throw
the
system
into
such
a
state
as
will
effect
its
own
cure
this
favourable
state
is
indicated
by
an
excessive
flow
of
saliva
or
what
is
called
dribbling
and
by
a
considerable
amount
of
relaxation
of
the
condition
that
must
not
be
mistaken
for
diarrhoea
and
checked
as
if
a
disease
but
rather
for
the
day
or
two
it
continues
encouraged
as
a
critical
evacuant
should
there
be
much
debility
in
the
convalescence
half
a
teaspoonful
of
stee
wine
given
twice
a
day
in
a
little
will
be
found
sufficient
for
all
the
purposes
of
a
tonic
this
with
the
precaution
of
changing
the
child
food
or
when
it
lives
on
the
mother
of
correcting
the
quality
of
the
milk
by
changing
her
own
diet
and
by
means
of
an
antacid
or
aperient
improving
the
state
of
the
secretion
such
is
all
the
treatment
that
this
disease
in
general
requires
the
class
of
diseases
we
are
now
approaching
are
the
most
important
both
in
their
pathological
features
and
in
their
consequences
on
the
constitution
of
any
group
or
individual
disease
that
assails
the
human
body
and
though
more
frequently
attacking
the
undeveloped
frame
of
childhood
are
yet
by
no
means
confined
to
that
period
these
are
called
eruptive
fevers
and
embrace
scarlet
fever
measles
milary
fever
and
erysipelas
or
fire
the
general
character
of
all
these
is
that
they
are
contagious
and
as
a
general
rule
attack
a
person
only
once
in
his
lifetime
that
their
chain
of
diseased
actions
always
begins
with
fever
and
that
after
an
interval
of
from
one
to
four
days
the
fever
is
followed
by
an
eruption
of
the
skin
or
and
or
vaccination
or
may
in
strict
propriety
be
classed
as
a
mild
variety
of
presenting
all
the
mitigated
symptoms
of
that
formidable
disease
among
many
physicians
it
is
indeed
classed
as
and
not
a
separate
disease
but
as
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
such
questions
and
as
we
profess
to
give
only
facts
the
result
of
our
own
practical
experience
we
shall
treat
this
affection
of
or
as
we
ourselves
have
found
it
as
a
distinct
and
separate
disease
is
marked
by
all
the
febrile
symptoms
presented
by
with
this
difference
that
in
the
case
of
each
symptom
is
particularly
slight
the
heat
of
body
is
much
less
acute
and
the
principal
symptoms
are
difficulty
of
breathing
headache
coated
tongue
and
nausea
which
sometimes
amounts
to
vomiting
after
a
term
of
general
irritability
heat
and
restlessness
about
the
fourth
day
or
between
the
third
and
fourth
an
eruption
makes
its
appearance
over
the
face
neck
and
body
in
its
first
two
stages
closely
resembling
with
this
especial
difference
that
whereas
the
pustules
in
have
and
centres
an
infallible
characteristic
of
the
pustules
in
remain
while
the
fluid
in
them
changes
from
a
transparent
white
to
a
liquid
which
begins
to
exude
and
disappear
about
the
eighth
or
ninth
day
and
in
mild
cases
by
the
twelfth
desquamates
or
peels
off
entirely
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
like
is
contagious
and
under
certain
states
of
the
atmosphere
becomes
endemic
parents
should
therefore
avoid
exposing
young
children
to
the
danger
of
infection
by
taking
them
where
it
is
known
to
exist
as
in
weakly
constitutions
or
in
very
young
children
may
superinduce
the
one
disease
either
running
concurrently
with
the
other
or
discovering
itself
as
the
other
declines
this
of
course
is
a
condition
that
renders
the
case
very
hazardous
as
the
child
has
to
struggle
against
two
diseases
at
once
or
before
it
has
recruited
strength
from
the
attack
of
the
first
in
all
ordinary
cases
of
and
it
is
very
seldom
it
assumes
any
complexity
the
whole
treatment
resolves
itself
into
the
use
of
the
warm
bath
and
a
course
of
gentle
aperients
the
bath
should
be
used
when
the
oppression
of
the
lungs
renders
the
breathing
difficult
or
the
heat
and
dryness
of
the
skin
with
the
undeveloped
rash
beneath
the
surface
shows
the
necessity
for
its
use
as
the
pustules
in
very
rarely
run
to
the
state
of
suppuration
as
in
the
other
disease
there
is
no
fear
of
or
disfigurement
except
in
very
severe
forms
which
however
happen
so
seldom
as
not
to
merit
apprehension
when
the
eruption
subsides
however
the
face
may
be
washed
with
water
and
the
routine
followed
which
is
prescribed
in
the
convalescent
state
of
properly
speaking
is
an
artificial
disease
established
in
a
healthy
body
as
a
prophylactic
or
preventive
agent
against
the
more
serious
attack
of
and
is
merely
that
chain
of
slight
febrile
symptoms
and
local
irritation
consequent
on
the
specific
action
of
the
lymph
of
the
vaccination
in
its
action
on
the
circulating
system
of
the
body
this
is
not
the
place
to
speak
of
the
benefits
conferred
on
mankind
by
the
discovery
of
vaccination
not
only
as
the
preserver
of
the
human
features
from
a
most
loathsome
disfigurement
but
as
a
sanitary
agent
in
the
prolongation
of
life
fortunately
the
state
has
now
made
it
imperative
on
all
parents
to
have
their
children
vaccinated
before
or
by
the
end
of
the
twelfth
week
thus
doing
away
as
far
as
possible
with
the
danger
to
public
health
proceeding
from
the
ignorance
or
prejudice
of
those
parents
whose
want
of
information
on
the
subject
makes
them
object
to
the
employment
of
this
specific
preventive
for
though
vaccination
has
been
proved
to
be
an
infallible
guard
against
the
attack
is
always
much
lighter
should
it
occur
and
is
seldom
if
indeed
fatal
after
the
precaution
of
vaccination
the
best
time
to
vaccinate
a
child
is
after
the
sixth
and
before
the
twelfth
week
if
it
is
in
perfect
health
but
still
earlier
if
is
prevalent
and
any
danger
exists
of
the
infant
taking
the
disease
it
is
customary
and
always
advisable
to
give
the
child
a
mild
aperient
powder
one
or
two
days
before
inserting
the
lymph
in
the
arm
and
should
measles
scarlet
fever
or
any
other
disease
arise
during
the
progress
of
the
pustule
the
child
when
recovered
should
be
and
the
lymph
taken
from
its
arm
on
no
account
used
for
vaccinating
purposes
the
disease
of
generally
takes
twenty
days
to
complete
its
course
in
other
words
the
maturity
and
declension
of
the
pustule
takes
that
time
to
fulfil
its
several
changes
the
mode
of
vaccination
is
either
to
insert
the
matter
or
lymph
taken
from
a
healthy
child
under
the
cuticle
in
several
places
on
both
arms
or
which
is
still
better
to
make
three
slight
scratches
or
abrasions
with
a
lancet
on
one
arm
in
this
manner
and
work
into
the
irritated
parts
the
lymph
allowing
the
arm
to
dry
thoroughly
before
putting
down
the
sleeve
by
this
means
absorption
is
insured
and
the
unnecessary
pain
of
several
pustules
on
both
arms
avoided
no
apparent
change
is
observable
by
the
eye
for
several
days
indeed
not
till
the
fourth
in
many
cases
is
there
any
evidence
of
a
vesicle
about
the
fifth
day
however
a
pink
areola
or
circle
is
observed
round
one
or
all
of
the
places
surrounding
a
small
pearly
vesicle
or
bladder
this
goes
on
deepening
in
hue
till
the
seventh
or
eighth
day
when
the
vesicle
is
about
an
inch
in
diameter
with
a
depressed
centre
on
the
ninth
the
edges
are
elevated
and
the
surrounding
part
hard
and
inflamed
the
disease
is
now
at
its
height
and
the
pustule
should
be
opened
if
not
for
the
purpose
of
vaccinating
other
children
to
allow
the
escape
of
the
lymph
and
subdue
the
inflammatory
action
after
the
twelfth
day
the
centre
is
covered
by
a
brown
scab
and
the
colour
of
the
swelling
becomes
darker
gradually
declining
in
hardness
and
colour
till
the
twentieth
when
the
scab
falls
off
leaving
a
small
pit
or
cicatrix
to
mark
the
seat
of
the
disease
and
for
life
prove
a
certificate
of
successful
vaccination
in
some
children
the
inflammation
and
swelling
of
the
arm
is
excessive
and
extremely
painful
and
the
fever
about
the
ninth
or
tenth
day
very
high
the
pustule
therefore
at
that
time
should
sometimes
be
opened
the
arm
fomented
every
two
hours
with
a
warm
bread
poultice
and
an
aperient
powder
given
to
the
infant
measles
and
scarlet
fever
with
the
treatment
of
both
measles
this
disease
which
forms
the
next
subject
in
our
series
of
infantine
diseases
and
which
entails
more
evils
on
the
health
of
childhood
than
any
other
description
of
physical
suffering
to
which
that
age
of
life
is
subject
may
be
considered
more
an
affection
of
the
venous
circulation
tending
to
general
and
local
congestion
attended
with
a
diseased
condition
of
the
blood
than
either
as
a
fever
or
an
inflammation
and
though
generally
classed
before
or
after
scarlet
fever
is
in
its
pathology
and
treatment
irrespective
of
its
as
distinct
and
opposite
as
one
disease
can
well
be
from
another
as
we
have
already
observed
measles
are
always
characterized
by
the
running
at
the
nose
and
eyes
and
great
oppression
of
breathing
so
in
the
mode
of
treatment
two
objects
are
to
be
held
especially
in
view
first
to
unload
the
congested
state
of
the
lungs
the
cause
of
the
oppressed
breathing
and
secondly
to
act
vigorously
both
during
the
disease
and
afterwards
on
the
bowels
at
the
same
time
it
can
not
be
too
strongly
borne
in
mind
that
though
the
patient
in
measles
should
on
no
account
be
kept
unduly
hot
more
care
than
in
most
infantine
complaints
should
be
taken
to
guard
the
body
from
or
any
abrupt
changes
of
temperature
with
these
special
observations
we
shall
proceed
to
give
a
description
of
the
disease
as
recognized
by
its
usual
which
commence
with
cold
chills
and
flushes
lassitude
heaviness
pain
in
the
head
and
drowsiness
cough
hoarseness
and
extreme
difficulty
of
breathing
frequent
sneezing
deduction
or
running
at
the
eyes
and
nose
nausea
sometimes
vomiting
thirst
a
furred
tongue
the
pulse
throughout
is
quick
and
sometimes
full
and
soft
at
others
hard
and
small
with
other
indications
of
an
inflammatory
nature
on
the
third
day
small
red
points
make
their
appearance
first
on
the
face
and
neck
gradually
extending
over
the
upper
and
lower
part
of
the
body
on
the
fifth
day
the
vivid
red
of
the
eruption
changes
into
a
brownish
hue
and
in
two
or
three
days
more
the
rash
entirely
disappears
leaving
a
loose
powdery
desquamation
on
the
skin
which
rubs
off
like
dandriff
at
this
stage
of
the
disease
a
diarrhoea
frequently
comes
on
which
being
what
is
called
critical
should
never
be
checked
unless
seriously
severe
measles
sometimes
assume
a
typhoid
or
malignant
character
in
which
form
the
symptoms
are
all
greatly
exaggerated
and
the
case
from
the
first
becomes
both
doubtful
and
dangerous
in
this
condition
the
eruption
comes
out
sooner
and
only
in
patches
and
often
after
showing
for
a
few
hours
suddenly
recedes
presenting
instead
of
the
usual
florid
red
a
dark
purple
or
blackish
hue
a
dark
brown
fur
forms
on
the
gums
and
mouth
the
breathing
becomes
laborious
delirium
supervenes
and
if
unrelieved
is
followed
by
coma
a
fetid
diarrhoea
takes
place
and
the
patient
sinks
under
the
congested
state
of
the
lungs
and
the
oppressed
functions
of
the
brain
the
unfavourable
symptoms
in
measles
are
a
high
degree
of
fever
the
excessive
heat
and
dryness
of
the
skin
hurried
and
short
breathing
and
a
particularly
hard
pulse
the
sequels
or
of
measles
are
croup
bronchitis
mesenteric
disease
abscesses
behind
the
ear
ophthalmia
and
glandular
swellings
in
other
parts
of
the
body
in
the
first
place
the
patient
should
be
kept
in
a
cool
room
the
temperature
of
which
must
be
regulated
to
suit
the
child
feelings
of
comfort
and
the
diet
adapted
to
the
strictest
principles
of
abstinence
when
the
inflammatory
symptoms
are
severe
bleeding
in
some
form
is
often
necessary
though
when
adopted
it
must
be
in
the
of
the
disease
and
if
the
lungs
are
the
apprehended
seat
of
the
inflammation
two
or
more
leeches
according
to
the
age
and
strength
of
the
patient
must
be
applied
to
the
upper
part
of
the
chest
followed
by
a
small
blister
or
the
blister
may
be
substituted
for
the
leeches
the
attendant
bearing
in
mind
that
the
benefit
effected
by
the
blister
can
always
be
considerably
augmented
by
plunging
the
feet
into
very
hot
water
about
a
couple
of
hours
after
applying
the
blister
and
kept
in
the
water
for
about
two
minutes
and
let
it
further
be
remembered
that
this
immersion
of
the
feet
in
hot
water
may
be
adopted
at
any
time
or
stage
of
the
disease
and
that
whenever
the
or
are
oppressed
relief
will
accrue
from
its
sudden
and
brief
employment
when
the
symptoms
commence
with
much
shivering
and
the
skin
early
assumes
a
hot
dry
character
the
appearance
of
the
rash
will
be
facilitated
and
all
the
other
symptoms
rendered
milder
if
the
patient
is
put
into
a
warm
bath
and
kept
in
the
water
for
about
three
minutes
or
where
that
is
not
convenient
the
following
process
which
will
answer
quite
as
well
can
be
substituted
stand
the
child
naked
in
a
tub
and
having
first
prepared
several
jugs
of
sufficiently
warm
water
empty
them
in
quick
succession
over
the
patient
shoulders
and
body
immediately
wrap
in
a
hot
blanket
and
put
the
child
to
bed
till
it
rouses
from
the
sleep
that
always
follows
the
effusion
or
bath
this
agent
by
lowering
the
temperature
of
the
skin
and
opening
the
pores
producing
a
natural
perspiration
and
unloading
the
congested
state
of
the
lungs
in
most
cases
does
away
entirely
with
the
necessity
both
for
leeches
and
a
blister
whether
any
of
these
external
means
have
been
employed
or
not
the
first
internal
remedies
should
commence
with
a
series
of
aperient
powders
and
a
saline
mixture
as
prescribed
in
the
following
formularies
at
the
same
time
as
a
beverage
to
quench
the
thirst
let
a
quantity
of
be
made
slightly
acidulated
by
the
juice
of
an
orange
and
partially
sweetened
by
some
and
of
which
when
properly
made
and
cold
let
the
patient
drink
as
often
as
thirst
or
the
dryness
of
the
mouth
renders
necessary
take
of
scammony
and
jalap
each
grains
grey
powder
and
powdered
antimony
each
grains
mix
and
divide
into
powders
if
for
a
child
between
two
and
four
years
of
age
into
powders
if
for
a
child
between
four
and
eight
years
of
ago
and
into
powders
for
between
eight
and
twelve
years
one
powder
to
be
given
in
a
little
jelly
or
every
three
or
four
hours
according
to
the
severity
of
the
symptoms
take
of
ounces
powdered
nitre
grains
antimonial
wine
drachms
spirits
of
nitre
drachms
syrup
of
saffron
drachms
mix
to
children
under
three
years
give
a
teaspoonful
every
two
hours
from
that
age
to
six
a
dessertspoonful
at
the
same
times
and
a
tablespoonful
every
three
or
four
hours
to
children
between
six
and
twelve
the
object
of
these
aperient
powders
is
to
keep
up
a
steady
but
gentle
action
on
the
bowels
but
whenever
it
seems
necessary
to
administer
a
stronger
dose
and
effect
a
brisk
action
on
the
digestive
organs
a
course
particularly
imperative
towards
the
close
of
the
disease
two
of
these
powders
given
at
once
according
to
the
age
will
be
found
to
produce
that
effect
that
is
two
of
the
twelve
for
a
child
under
four
years
and
two
of
the
eight
and
two
of
the
six
according
to
the
age
of
the
patient
when
the
difficulty
of
breathing
becomes
oppressive
as
it
generally
does
towards
night
a
hot
bran
poultice
laid
on
the
chest
will
be
always
found
highly
beneficial
the
diet
throughout
must
be
light
and
consist
of
farinaceous
food
such
as
rice
and
sago
puddings
and
toast
and
not
till
convalescence
sets
in
should
hard
or
animal
food
be
given
when
measles
assume
the
malignant
form
the
advice
just
given
must
be
broken
through
food
of
a
nutritious
and
stimulating
character
should
be
at
once
substituted
and
administered
in
conjunction
with
wine
and
even
spirits
and
the
disease
regarded
and
treated
as
a
case
of
typhus
but
as
this
form
of
measles
is
not
frequent
and
if
occurring
hardly
likely
to
be
treated
without
assistance
it
is
unnecessary
to
enter
on
the
minutiae
of
its
practice
here
what
we
have
prescribed
in
almost
all
cases
will
be
found
sufficient
to
meet
every
emergency
without
resorting
to
a
multiplicity
of
agents
the
great
point
to
remember
in
measles
is
not
to
give
up
the
treatment
with
the
apparent
subsidence
of
the
disease
as
the
of
measles
are
too
often
more
serious
and
to
be
more
dreaded
than
the
measles
themselves
to
guard
against
this
danger
and
thoroughly
purify
the
system
after
the
subsidence
of
all
the
symptoms
of
the
disease
a
corrective
course
of
medicine
and
a
regimen
of
exercise
should
be
adopted
for
some
weeks
after
the
cure
of
the
disease
to
effect
this
an
active
aperient
powder
should
be
given
every
three
or
four
clays
with
a
daily
dose
of
the
subjoined
tonic
mixture
with
as
much
exercise
by
walking
running
after
a
hoop
or
other
bodily
exertion
as
the
strength
of
the
child
and
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
will
admit
the
patient
being
wherever
possible
removed
to
a
purer
air
as
soon
as
convalescence
warrants
the
change
take
of
infusion
of
ounces
quinine
grains
diluted
sulphuric
acid
drops
mix
dose
from
half
a
teaspoonful
up
to
a
dessertspoonful
once
a
day
according
to
the
ago
of
the
patient
scarlatina
or
scarlet
fever
though
professional
accuracy
has
divided
this
disease
into
several
forms
we
shall
keep
to
the
one
disease
most
generally
mot
with
the
common
or
simple
scarlet
fever
which
in
all
cases
is
characterized
by
an
excessive
heat
on
the
skin
sore
throat
and
a
peculiar
speckled
appearance
of
the
tongue
cold
chills
shivering
nausea
thirst
hot
skin
quick
pulse
with
difficulty
of
swallowing
the
tongue
is
coated
presenting
through
its
fur
innumerable
specks
the
elevated
papillae
of
the
tongue
which
gives
it
the
speckled
character
that
if
not
the
invariable
sign
of
scarlet
fever
is
only
met
with
in
cases
closely
analogous
to
that
disease
between
the
and
day
but
most
frequently
on
the
a
bright
red
efflorescence
breaks
out
in
patches
on
the
face
neck
and
back
from
which
it
extends
over
the
trunk
and
extremities
always
showing
thicker
and
deeper
in
colour
wherever
there
is
any
pressure
such
as
the
elbows
back
and
hips
when
the
eruption
is
well
out
the
skin
presents
the
appearance
of
a
boiled
at
first
the
skin
is
smooth
but
as
the
disease
advances
perceptible
roughness
is
apparent
from
the
elevation
of
the
rash
or
more
properly
the
pores
of
the
skin
on
the
and
days
the
eruption
begins
to
decline
and
by
the
has
generally
entirely
disappeared
during
the
whole
of
this
period
there
is
more
or
less
constant
sore
throat
the
of
scarlet
fever
is
in
general
very
simple
where
the
heat
is
great
and
the
eruption
comes
out
with
difficulty
or
recedes
as
soon
as
it
appears
the
body
should
be
sponged
with
cold
or
tepid
water
as
in
measles
poured
over
the
chest
and
body
the
patient
being
as
in
that
disease
wrapped
in
a
blanket
and
put
to
bed
and
the
same
powders
and
mixture
ordered
in
measles
administered
with
the
addition
of
a
constant
hot
bran
poultice
round
the
throat
which
should
be
continued
from
the
first
symptom
till
a
day
or
two
after
the
declension
of
the
rash
the
same
low
diet
and
cooling
drink
with
the
same
general
instructions
are
to
be
obeyed
in
this
as
in
the
former
disease
when
the
fever
runs
high
in
the
first
stage
and
there
is
much
nausea
before
employing
the
effusions
of
water
give
the
patient
an
emetic
of
equal
parts
of
ipecacuanha
and
antimonial
wine
in
doses
of
from
a
teaspoonful
to
a
tablespoonful
according
to
age
by
these
means
nine
out
of
every
ten
cases
of
scarlatina
may
be
safely
and
expeditiously
cured
especially
if
the
temperature
of
the
patient
room
is
kept
at
an
even
standard
of
about
sixty
degrees
croup
and
diarrhoea
with
their
mode
of
treatment
this
is
purely
a
spasmodic
disease
and
is
only
infectious
through
the
faculty
of
imitation
a
habit
that
all
children
are
remarkably
apt
to
fall
into
and
even
where
adults
have
contracted
it
has
been
from
the
same
cause
and
is
as
readily
accounted
for
on
the
principle
of
imitation
as
that
the
gaping
of
one
person
will
excite
or
predispose
a
whole
party
to
follow
the
same
spasmodic
example
if
any
one
associates
for
a
few
days
with
a
person
who
stammers
badly
he
will
find
when
released
from
his
company
that
the
sequence
of
his
articulation
and
the
fluency
of
his
speech
are
for
a
time
gone
and
it
will
be
a
matter
of
constant
vigilance
and
some
difficulty
to
overcome
the
evil
of
so
short
an
association
the
manner
in
which
a
number
of
will
one
after
another
fall
into
a
fit
on
beholding
one
of
their
number
attacked
with
epilepsy
must
be
familiar
to
many
these
several
facts
lead
us
to
a
juster
notion
of
how
to
treat
this
spasmodic
disease
every
effort
should
therefore
be
directed
mentally
and
physically
to
break
the
chain
of
nervous
action
on
which
the
continuance
of
the
cough
depends
comes
on
with
a
slight
oppression
of
breathing
thirst
quick
pulse
hoarseness
and
a
hard
dry
cough
this
state
may
exist
without
any
change
from
one
to
two
or
three
weeks
before
the
peculiar
feature
of
the
in
as
the
characteristics
of
this
cough
are
known
to
all
it
is
unnecessary
to
enter
here
physiologically
on
the
subject
we
shall
therefore
merely
remark
that
the
frequent
vomiting
and
bleeding
at
the
mouth
or
nose
are
favourable
signs
and
proceed
to
the
which
should
consist
in
keeping
up
a
state
of
nausea
and
vomiting
for
this
purpose
give
the
child
doses
of
ipecacuanha
and
antimonial
wines
in
equal
parts
and
quantities
varying
from
half
to
one
and
a
half
teaspoonful
once
a
day
or
when
the
expectoration
is
hard
and
difficult
of
expulsion
giving
the
following
cough
mixture
every
four
hours
take
of
syrup
of
squills
ounce
antimonial
wine
ounce
laudanum
drops
syrup
of
toulou
drachms
water
ounce
mix
the
dose
is
from
half
a
spoonful
to
a
dessertspoonful
when
the
cough
is
urgent
the
warm
bath
is
to
be
used
and
either
one
or
two
leeches
applied
over
the
breastbone
or
else
a
small
blister
laid
on
the
lower
part
of
the
throat
such
is
the
medical
treatment
of
but
there
is
a
moral
regimen
based
on
the
nature
of
the
disease
which
should
never
be
omitted
and
on
the
principle
that
a
sudden
start
or
diversion
of
the
mind
will
arrest
a
person
in
the
act
of
sneezing
or
gaping
so
the
like
means
should
be
adopted
with
the
patient
and
in
the
first
stage
before
the
has
been
added
the
parent
should
endeavour
to
break
the
paroxysm
of
the
cough
by
abruptly
attracting
the
patient
attention
and
thus
if
possible
preventing
the
cough
from
reaching
that
height
when
the
ingulp
of
air
gives
the
hoop
or
crow
that
marks
the
disease
but
when
once
that
symptom
has
set
in
it
becomes
still
more
necessary
to
endeavour
by
even
measures
of
intimidation
to
break
the
spasmodic
chain
of
the
cough
exercise
in
the
open
air
when
dry
is
also
requisite
and
charge
of
scene
and
air
in
all
cases
is
of
absolute
necessity
and
may
be
adopted
at
any
stage
of
the
disease
croup
this
is
by
far
the
most
formidable
and
fatal
of
all
the
diseases
to
which
infancy
and
childhood
are
liable
and
is
purely
an
inflammatory
affection
attacking
that
portion
of
the
mucous
membrane
lining
the
windpipe
and
bronchial
tubes
and
from
the
effect
of
which
a
false
or
loose
membrane
is
formed
along
the
windpipe
resembling
in
appearance
the
finger
of
a
glove
suspended
in
the
passage
and
consequently
terminating
the
life
of
the
patient
by
suffocation
for
as
the
lower
end
grows
together
and
becomes
closed
no
air
can
enter
the
lungs
and
the
child
dies
choked
all
dull
fat
and
heavy
children
are
peculiarly
predisposed
to
this
disease
and
those
with
short
necks
and
who
make
a
wheezing
noise
in
their
natural
breathing
croup
is
always
sudden
in
its
attack
and
rapid
in
its
career
usually
proving
fatal
within
three
days
most
frequently
commences
in
the
night
and
generally
attacking
children
between
the
ages
of
three
and
ten
years
mothers
should
therefore
be
on
their
guard
who
have
children
predisposed
to
this
disease
and
immediately
resort
to
the
means
hereafter
advised
languor
and
restlessness
hoarseness
wheezing
and
short
dry
cough
with
occasional
rattling
in
the
throat
during
sleep
the
child
often
plucking
at
its
throat
with
its
fingers
difficulty
of
breathing
which
quickly
becomes
hard
and
laboured
causing
great
anxiety
of
the
countenance
and
the
veins
of
the
neck
to
swell
and
become
knotted
the
voice
in
speaking
acquires
a
sharp
crowing
or
croupy
sound
while
the
inspirations
have
a
harsh
metallic
intonation
after
a
few
hours
a
quantity
of
thick
ropy
mucus
is
thrown
out
hanging
about
the
mouth
and
causing
suffocating
fits
of
coughing
to
expel
place
the
child
immediately
in
a
hot
bath
up
to
the
throat
and
on
removal
from
the
water
give
an
emetic
of
the
antimonial
or
ipecacuanha
wine
and
when
the
vomiting
has
subsided
lay
a
long
blister
down
the
front
of
the
throat
and
administer
one
of
the
following
powders
every
twenty
minutes
to
a
child
from
three
to
six
years
of
age
take
of
calomel
grains
tartar
emetic
grains
lump
sugar
grains
mix
accurately
and
divide
into
powders
for
a
child
from
six
to
twelve
years
divide
into
powders
and
give
one
every
should
the
symptoms
remain
unabated
after
a
few
hours
apply
one
or
two
leeches
to
the
throat
and
put
mustard
poultices
to
the
foot
and
thighs
retaining
them
about
eight
minutes
and
in
extreme
cases
a
mustard
poultice
to
the
spine
between
the
shoulders
and
at
the
same
time
rub
mercurial
ointment
into
the
armpits
and
the
angles
of
the
jaws
such
is
a
vigorous
and
reliable
system
of
treatment
in
severe
cases
of
croup
but
in
the
milder
and
more
general
form
the
following
abridgment
will
in
all
probability
be
all
that
will
be
required
first
the
hot
bath
second
the
emetic
third
a
mustard
plaster
round
the
throat
for
five
minutes
fourth
the
powders
fifth
another
emetic
in
six
hours
if
needed
and
the
powders
continued
without
intermission
while
the
urgency
of
the
symptoms
continues
when
relief
has
been
obtained
these
are
to
be
discontinued
and
a
dose
of
senna
tea
given
to
act
on
the
bowels
diarrhoea
the
diarrhoea
with
which
children
are
so
frequently
affected
especially
in
infancy
should
demand
the
nurse
immediate
attention
and
when
the
secretion
from
its
clayey
colour
indicates
an
absence
of
bile
a
powder
composed
of
grains
of
grey
powder
and
grain
of
rhubarb
should
be
given
twice
with
an
interval
of
four
hours
between
each
dose
to
a
child
from
one
to
two
years
and
a
day
or
two
afterwards
an
aperient
powder
containing
the
same
ingredients
and
quantities
with
the
addition
of
or
grains
of
scammony
for
the
relaxation
consequent
on
an
overloaded
stomach
or
acidity
in
the
bowels
a
little
magnesia
dissolved
in
milk
should
be
employed
two
or
three
times
a
day
when
much
griping
and
pain
attend
the
diarrhoea
half
a
teaspoonful
of
dalby
carminative
the
best
of
all
patent
medicines
should
be
given
either
with
or
without
a
small
quantity
of
castor
oil
to
carry
off
the
exciting
cause
for
any
form
of
diarrhoea
that
by
excessive
action
demands
a
speedy
correction
the
most
efficacious
remedy
that
can
be
employed
in
all
ages
and
conditions
of
childhood
is
the
tincture
of
kino
of
which
from
to
drops
mixed
with
a
little
sugar
and
water
in
a
spoon
are
to
be

every
two
or
three
hours
till
the
undue
action
has
been
checked

the
change
of
diet
to
rice

or
the
substitution
of
animal
for
vegetable
food
or
will
correct
an
unpleasant
and
almost
chronic
state
of
diarrhoea
a
very
excellent
carminative
powder
for
flatulent
infants
may
be
kept
in
the
house
and
employed
with
advantage
whenever
the
child
is
in
pain
or
griped
by
dropping
grains
of
oil
of
aniseed
and
of
peppermint
on
half
an
ounce
of
lump
sugar
and
rubbing
it
in
a
mortar
with
a
drachm
of
magnesia
into
a
fine
powder
a
small
quantity
of
this
may
be
given
in
a
little
water
at
any
time

always

benefit

xliii

according
to
the
old
proverb
is

and
it
may
also
in
many
cases
and
with
equal
truthfulness
be
said
to
be

a
few

this
applies
more
especially
to
all
kinds
of
poisoning
fits
submersion
in
water
or
exposure
to
noxious
gases
and
many
accidents
if
people
knew
how
to
act
during
the
interval
that
must
necessarily
elapse
from
the
moment
that
a
medical
man
is
sent

lives
might

now
unhappily
are

and
varying
in
degree
is
the
same
in
principle
whether
procured
by
hot
or
cold
water
there
are
three
forms
in
which
heat
is
universally
applied
to
the
body
that
of
the
tepid
warm
and
vapour
bath
but
as
the
first
is
too
inert
to
be
worth
notice
and
the
last
dangerous
and
inapplicable
except
in
public
institutions
we
shall
confine
our
remarks
to
the
really
efficacious
and
always
attainable
one
the
and
hot
these
baths
are
used
whenever
there
is
congestion
or
accumulation
of
blood
in
the
internal
organs
causing
pain
difficulty
of
breathing
or
stupor
and
are
employed
by
their
stimulating
property
to
cause
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
surface
and
by
unloading
the
great
organs
produce
a
temporary
inflammation
in
the
skin
and
so
equalize
the
circulation
the
effect
of
the
hot
bath
is
to
increase
the
fulness
of
the
pulse
accelerate
respiration
and
excite
perspiration
in
all
inflammations
of
the
stomach
and
bowels
the
hot
bath
is
of
the
utmost
consequence
the
temperature
of
the
warm
bath
varies
from
to
and
may
be
obtained
by
those
who
have
no
thermometer
to
test
the
exact
heat
by
mixing
one
measure
of
boiling
with
two
of
cold
water
are
generally
used
to
effect
in
a
part
the
benefit
produced
on
the
whole
body
by
the
bath
to
which
a
sedative
action
is
occasionally
given
by
the
use
of
roots
herbs
or
other
ingredients
the
object
being
to
relieve
the
internal
organ
as
the
throat
or
muscles
round
a
joint
by
exciting
a
greater
flow
of
blood
to
the
skin
the
affected
part
as
the
real
agent
of
relief
is
heat
the
fomentation
should
always
be
as
hot
as
it
can
comfortably
be
borne
and
to
insure
effect
should
be
repeated
every
warm
fluids
are
applied
in
order
to
render
the
swelling
which
accompanies
inflammation
less
painful
by
the
greater
readiness
with
which
the
skin
yields
than
when
it
is
harsh
and
dry
they
are
of
various
kinds
but
the
most
simple
and
oftentimes
the
most
useful
that
can
be
employed
is
warm
water
another
kind
of
fomentation
is
composed
of
dried
poppyheads
oz
break
them
to
pieces
empty
out
the
seeds
put
them
into
pints
of
water
boil
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
strain
through
a
cloth
or
sieve
and
keep
the
water
for
use
or
chamomile
flowers
hemlock
and
many
other
plants
may
be
boiled
and
the
part
fomented
with
the
hot
liquor
by
means
of
flannels
wetted
with
the
decoction
when
applied
in
excess
to
the
body
drives
the
blood
from
the
surface
to
the
centre
reduces
the
pulse
makes
the
breathing
hard
and
difficult
produces
coma
and
if
long
continued
death
but
when
medicinally
used
it
excites
a
reaction
on
the
surface
equivalent
to
a
stimulating
effect
as
in
some
cases
of
fever
when
the
body
has
been
sponged
with
cold
water
it
excites
by
reaction
increased
circulation
on
the
skin
cold
is
sometimes
used
to
keep
up
a
repellent
action
as
when
local
inflammation
takes
place
a
remedy
is
applied
which
by
its
benumbing
and
astringent
effect
causes
the
blood
or
the
excess
of
it
in
the
part
to
recede
and
by
contracting
the
vessels
prevents
the
return
of
any
undue
quantity
till
the
affected
part
recovers
its
tone
such
remedies
are
called
and
should
when
used
be
applied
with
the
same
persistency
as
the
fomentation
for
as
the
latter
should
be
renewed
as
often
as
the
heat
passes
off
so
the
former
should
be
applied
as
often
as
the
heat
from
the
skin
deprives
the
application
of
its
cold
are
only
another
form
of
fomentation
though
chiefly
used
for
abscesses
the
ingredient
best
suited
for
a
poultice
is
that
which
retains
heat
the
longest
of
these
ingredients
the
best
are
linseed
meal
bran
and
bread
bran
sewed
into
a
bag
as
it
can
be
reheated
will
be
found
the
cleanest
and
most
useful
especially
for
sore
throats
how
to
bleed
in
cases
of
great
emergency
such
as
the
strong
kind
of
apoplexy
and
when
a
surgeon
can
not
possibly
be
obtained
for
some
considerable
time
the
life
of
the
patient
depends
almost
entirely
upon
the
fact
of
his
being
bled
or
not
we
therefore
give
instructions
how
the
operation
of
bleeding
is
to
be
performed
but
caution
the
reader
only
to
attempt
it
in
cases
of
the
greatest
emergency
place
a
handkerchief
or
piece
of
tape
rather
but
not
too
tightly
round
the
arm
about
three
or
four
inches
above
the
elbow
this
will
cause
the
veins
below
to
swell
and
become
very
evident
if
this
is
not
sufficient
the
hand
should
be
constantly
and
quickly
opened
and
shut
for
the
same
purpose
there
will
now
be
seen
passing
up
the
middle
of
the
a
vein
which
just
below
the
bend
of
the
elbow
sends
a
branch
inwards
and
outwards
each
branch
shortly
joining
another
large
vein
it
is
from
the
branch
that
the
person
is
to
be
bled
the
right
arm
is
the
one
mostly
operated
on
the
operator
should
take
the
lancet
in
his
right
hand
between
the
thumb
and
first
finger
place
the
thumb
of
his
left
hand
on
the
vein
below
the
part
where
he
is
going
to
bleed
from
and
then
gently
thrust
the
tip
of
the
lancet
into
the
vein
and
taking
care
not
to
push
it
too
deeply
cut
in
a
gently
curved
direction
thus
and
bring
it
out
point
upwards
at
about
half
an
inch
from
the
part
of
the
vein
into
which
he
had
thrust
it
the
vein
must
be
cut
lengthways
and
not
across
when
sufficient
blood
has
been
taken
away
remove
the
bandage
from
above
the
elbow
and
place
the
thumb
of
the
left
hand
firmly
over
the
cut
until
all
the
bleeding
ceases
a
small
pad
of
lint
is
then
to
be
put
over
the
cut
with
a
larger
pad
over
it
and
the
two
kept
in
their
places
by
means
of
a
handkerchief
or
linen
roller
bound
pretty
tightly
over
them
and
round
the
arm
when
a
person
is
bled
he
should
always
be
in
the
standing
or
at
any
rate
in
the
sitting
position
for
if
as
is
often
the
case
he
should
happen
to
faint
he
can
in
most
eases
at
least
easily
be
brought
to
again
by
the
operator
placing
him
flat
on
his
back
and
stopping
the
bleeding
is
of
the
greatest
it
has
been
recommended
for
what
supposed
advantages
we
do
know
to
bleed
people
when
they
are
lying
down
should
a
person
under
these
circumstances
faint
what
could
be
done
to
bring
him
to
again
the
great
treatment
of
lowering
the
body
of
the
patient
to
the
flat
position
can
not
be
followed
here
it
is
in
that
position
already
and
can
not
be
placed
lower
than
it
at
present
is
except
as
is
most
likely
to
be
the
case
under
the
ground
bleeding
from
the
many
children
especially
those
of
a
sanguineous
temperament
are
subject
to
sudden
discharges
of
blood
from
some
part
of
the
body
and
as
all
such
fluxes
are
in
general
the
result
of
an
effort
of
nature
to
relieve
the
system
from
some
overload
or
pressure
such
discharges
unless
in
excess
and
when
likely
to
produce
debility
should
not
be
rashly
or
too
abruptly
checked
in
general
these
discharges
are
confined
to
the
summer
or
spring
months
of
the
year
and
follow
pains
in
the
head
a
sense
of
drowsiness
languor
or
oppression
and
as
such
symptoms
are
relieved
by
the
loss
of
blood
the
hemorrhage
should
to
a
certain
extent
be
encouraged
when
however
the
bleeding
is
excessive
or
returns
too
frequently
it
becomes
necessary
to
apply
means
to
subdue
or
mitigate
the
amount
for
this
purpose
the
sudden
and
unexpected
application
of
cold
is
itself
sufficient
in
most
cases
to
arrest
the
most
active
hemorrhage
a
wet
towel
laid
suddenly
on
the
back
between
the
shoulders
and
placing
the
child
in
a
recumbent
posture
is
often
sufficient
to
effect
the
object
where
however
the
effusion
resists
such
simple
means
napkins
wrung
out
of
cold
water
must
be
laid
across
the
forehead
and
nose
the
hands
dipped
in
cold
water
and
a
bottle
of
hot
water
applied
to
the
feet
if
in
spite
of
these
means
the
bleeding
continues
a
little
fine
wool
or
a
few
folds
of
lint
tied
together
by
a
piece
of
thread
must
be
pushed
up
the
nostril
from
which
the
blood
flows
to
act
as
a
plug
and
pressure
on
the
bleeding
vessel
when
the
discharge
has
entirely
ceased
the
plug
is
to
be
pulled
out
by
means
of
the
thread
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
hemorrhage
the
body
should
be
sponged
every
morning
with
cold
water
and
the
child
put
under
a
course
of
steel
wine
have
exercise
and
if
possible
bathing
for
children
a
key
suddenly
dropped
down
the
back
between
the
skin
and
clothes
will
often
immediately
arrest
a
copious
bleeding
spitting
of
blood
or
hemorrhage
from
the
lungs
is
generally
known
from
blood
from
the
stomach
by
its
being
of
a
brighter
colour
and
in
less
quantities
than
that
which
is
always
grumous
and
mixed
with
the
food
in
either
case
rest
should
be
immediately
enjoined
total
abstinence
from
stimulants
and
a
low
poor
diet
accompanied
with
the
horizontal
position
and
bottles
of
boiling
water
to
the
feet
at
the
same
time
the
patient
should
suck
through
a
quill
every
hour
half
a
of
water
in
which
or
drops
of
the
elixir
of
vitriol
has
been
mixed
and
till
further
advice
has
been
procured
keep
a
towel
wrung
out
of
cold
water
on
the
chest
or
stomach
according
to
the
seat
of
the
hemorrhage
bites
and
stings
bites
and
stings
may
be
divided
into
three
kinds
those
of
insects
those
of
snakes
those
of
dogs
and
other
animals
bites
or
stings
of
such
as
gnats
bees
wasps
need
cause
very
little
alarm
and
are
generally
speaking
easily
cured
they
are
very
serious
however
when
they
take
place
on
some
delicate
part
of
the
body
such
as
near
the
eye
or
in
the
throat
is
very
simple
in
most
cases
and
consists
in
taking
out
the
sting
if
it
is
left
behind
with
a
needle
and
applying
to
the
part
a
liniment
made
of
chalk
and
mixed
together
to
about
the
thickness
of
cream
bathing
the
part
bitten
with
warm
turpentine
or
warm
vinegar
is
also
of
great
use
if
the
person
feels
faint
he
should
lie
quietly
on
his
back
and
take
a
little
or
and
water
when
the
inside
of
the
throat
is
the
part
stung
there
is
great
danger
of
violent
inflammation
taking
place
in
this
case
from
eight
to
twelve
leeches
should
be
immediately
put
to
the
outside
of
the
throat
and
when
they
drop
off
the
part
to
which
they
had
been
applied
should
be
well
fomented
with
warm
water
the
inside
of
the
throat
is
to
be
constantly
gargled
with
salt
and
water
bits
of
ice
are
to
be
sucked
rubbing
the
face
and
hands
well
over
with
plain
before
going
to
bed
will
often
keep
gnats
and
musquitoes
from
biting
during
the
night
strong
scent
such
as
will
have
the
same
effect
of
these
are
much
more
dangerous
than
the
preceding
and
require
more
powerful
remedies
the
bites
of
the
different
kinds
of
snakes
do
not
all
act
alike
but
affect
people
in
different
of
the
part
the
great
thing
is
to
prevent
the
poison
getting
into
the
blood
and
if
possible
to
remove
the
whole
of
it
at
once
from
the
body
a
a
piece
of
tape
or
cord
or
in
fact
of
anything
that
is
at
hand
should
be
tied
tightly
round
the
part
of
the
body
bitten
if
it
be
the
leg
or
arm
immediately
the
bite
and
between
it
and
the
heart
the
bite
should
then
be
sucked
several
times
by
any
one
who
is
near
there
is
no
danger
in
this
provided
the
person
who
does
it
has
not
got
the
skin
taken
off
any
part
of
his
mouth
what
has
been
sucked
into
the
mouth
should
be
immediately
spit
out
again
but
if
those
who
are
near
have
sufficient
nerve
for
the
operation
and
a
suitable
instrument
they
should
cut
out
the
central
part
bitten
and
then
bathe
the
wound
for
some
time
with
warm
water
to
make
it
bleed
freely
the
wound
should
afterwards
be
rubbed
with
a
stick
of
lunar
caustic
or
what
is
better
a
solution
of
this
grains
of
lunar
caustic
dissolved
in
an
ounce
of
water
should
be
dropped
into
it
the
band
should
be
kept
on
the
part
during
the
whole
of
the
time
that
these
means
are
being
adopted
the
wound
should
afterwards
be
covered
with
lint
dipped
in
cold
water
the
best
plan
however
to
be
adopted
if
it
can
be
managed
is
the
following
take
a
common
and
holding
it
upside
down
put
a
lighted
candle
or
a
into
it
for
a
minute
or
two
this
will
take
out
the
air
then
clap
the
glass
suddenly
over
the
bitten
part
and
it
will
become
attached
and
hold
on
to
the
flesh
the
glass
being
nearly
empty
the
blood
containing
the
poison
will
in
consequence
flow
into
it
from
the
wound
of
its
own
accord
this
process
should
be
repeated
three
or
four
times
and
the
wound
sucked
or
washed
with
warm
water
before
each
application
of
the
glass
as
a
matter
of
course
when
the
glass
is
removed
all
the
blood
should
be
washed
out
of
it
before
it
is
applied
there
is
mostly
at
first
great
depression
of
strength
in
these
cases
and
it
is
therefore
requisite
to
give
some
stimulant
a
glass
of
hot
or
twenty
drops
of
is
the
best
that
can
be
given
when
the
strength
has
returned
and
if
the
patient
has
not
already
been
sick
a
little
mustard
in
hot
water
should
be
given
to
make
him
so
if
on
the
other
hand
as
is
often
the
case
the
vomiting
is
excessive
a
large
mustard
poultice
should
be
placed
over
the
stomach
and
a
grain
of
solid
opium
swallowed
in
the
form
of
a
pill
for
the
purpose
of
stopping
it
only
one
of
these
pills
should
be
given
by
a
person
in
all
cases
of
bites
from
snakes
send
for
a
surgeon
as
quickly
as
possible
and
act
according
to
the
above
directions
until
he
arrives
if
he
is
within
any
reasonable
distance
content
yourself
by
putting
on
the
band
sucking
the
wound
applying
the
glass
and
if
necessary
giving
a
little
of
for
obvious
reasons
these
kinds
of
bites
are
more
frequently
met
with
than
those
of
snakes
is
the
same
as
that
for
more
especially
that
of
the
bitten
part
the
majority
of
writers
on
the
subject
are
in
favour
of
keeping
the
wound
open
as
long
as
possible
this
may
be
done
by
putting
a
few
beans
on
it
and
then
by
applying
a
large
poultice
over
them
injuries
and
accidents
to
bones
of
when
the
end
of
a
bone
is
pushed
out
of
its
natural
position
it
is
said
to
be
dislocated
this
may
be
caused
by
violence
disease
or
natural
weakness
of
the
parts
about
a
deformity
about
the
joint
with
unnatural
prominence
at
one
part
and
depression
at
another
the
limb
may
be
shorter
or
longer
than
usual
and
is
stiff
and
unable
to
be
moved
differing
in
these
last
two
respects
from
a
broken
limb
which
is
mostly
shorter
never
longer
than
usual
and
which
is
always
more
so
much
practical
science
and
tact
are
requisite
in
order
to
bring
a
dislocated
bone
into
its
proper
position
again
that
we
strongly
advise
the
reader
never
to
interfere
in
these
cases
unless
indeed
it
is
altogether
impossible
to
obtain
the
services
of
a
surgeon
but
because
any
one
of
us
may
very
possibly
be
placed
in
that
emergency
we
give
a
few
rough
rules
for
the
reader
guidance
in
the
first
place
make
the
joint
from
which
the
bone
has
been
displaced
perfectly
steady
either
by
fixing
it
to
some
firm
object
or
else
by
holding
it
with
the
hands
then
pull
the
dislocated
bone
in
a
direction
towards
the
place
from
which
it
has
been
thrust
so
that
if
it
moves
at
all
from
its
unnatural
position
it
may
have
the
best
chance
of
returning
to
its
proper
place
do
not
however
pull
or
press
against
the
parts
too
violently
as
you
may
perhaps
by
doing
so
rupture
and
produce
most
serious
consequences
when
you
attempt
to
reduce
a
dislocated
bone
do
it
as
quickly
as
possible
after
the
accident
has
taken
place
every
hour
making
the
operation
more
difficult
when
the
patient
is
very
strong
he
may
be
put
into
a
warm
bath
until
he
feels
faint
or
have
sixty
drops
of
antimonial
wine
given
him
every
ten
minutes
until
he
feels
sickish
these
two
means
are
of
great
use
in
relaxing
the
muscles
if
the
bone
has
been
brought
back
again
to
its
proper
place
keep
it
there
by
means
of
bandages
and
if
there
is
much
pain
about
the
joint
apply
a
cold
lotion
to
it
and
keep
it
perfectly
at
rest
the
lotion
should
be
a
of
goulard
extract
and
two
tablespoonfuls
of
vinegar
mixed
in
a
pint
of
water
leeches
are
sometimes
necessary
unless
the
local
pain
or
general
feverish
symptoms
are
great
the
patient
diet
should
be
the
same
as
usual
dislocations
may
be
reduced
a
week
or
even
a
fortnight
after
they
have
taken
place
as
therefore
although
the
sooner
a
bone
is
reduced
the
better
there
is
no
very
great
emergency
and
as
the
most
serious
consequences
may
follow
improper
or
too
violent
treatment
it
is
always
better
for
people
in
these
cases
to
do
too
little
than
too
much
inasmuch
as
the
good
which
has
not
yet
may
still
be
done
whereas
the
evil
that
been
done
can
not
so
easily
be
undone
fractures
of
deformity
of
the
part
unnatural
looseness
a
grating
sound
when
the
two
ends
of
the
broken
bone
are
rubbed
together
loss
of
natural
motion
and
power
in
some
cases
there
is
also
shortening
of
the
fracture
takes
place
from
several
causes
as
a
fall
a
blow
a
squeeze
and
sometimes
from
the
violent
action
of
in
cases
where
a
surgeon
can
not
be
procured
immediately
after
the
accident
the
following
general
rules
are
offered
for
the
reader
guidance
the
broken
limb
should
be
placed
and
kept
as
nearly
as
possible
in
its
natural
position
this
is
to
be
done
by
first
pulling
the
two
portions
of
the
bone
in
opposite
directions
until
the
limb
becomes
as
long
as
the
opposite
one
and
then
by
applying
a
splint
and
binding
it
to
the
part
by
means
of
a
roller
when
there
is
no
deformity
the
pulling
is
of
course
unnecessary
if
there
is
much
swelling
about
the
broken
part
a
cold
lotion
is
to
be
applied
this
lotion
we
will
call
lotion
no
may
be
thus
made
mix
a
of
goulard
extract
and
two
tablespoonfuls
of
vinegar
in
a
pint
of
water
when
the
leg
or
arm
is
broken
always
if
possible
get
it
to
the
same
length
and
form
as
the
opposite
limb
the
broken
part
should
be
kept
perfectly
quiet
when
a
broken
limb
is
deformed
and
a
particular
muscle
is
on
the
stretch
place
the
limb
in
such
a
position
as
will
relax
it
this
will
in
most
cases
cure
the
deformity
or
and
water
are
to
be
given
when
the
patient
is
faint
surgical
aid
should
of
course
be
procured
as
soon
as
possible
joints
injuries
all
kinds
of
injuries
to
joints
of
whatever
description
require
particular
attention
in
consequence
of
the
violent
inflammations
which
are
so
liable
to
take
place
in
these
parts
of
the
body
and
which
do
so
much
mischief
in
a
little
time
the
joint
injured
should
always
be
kept
perfectly
at
rest
and
when
it
is
very
painful
and
the
skin
about
it
red
swollen
hot
and
shining
at
the
same
time
that
the
patient
has
general
feverish
symptoms
such
as
great
thirst
and
headache
leeches
and
when
they
drop
off
warm
poppy
fomentations
are
to
be
applied
the
no
pills
are
to
be
given
two
are
a
dose
for
a
grown
person
with
a
black
draught
three
hours
afterwards
give
also
two
tablespoonfuls
of
the
every
four
hours
and
keep
the
patient
on
low
diet
when
the
injury
and
swelling
are
not
very
great
warm
applications
with
rest
low
diet
and
a
dose
of
aperient
medicine
will
be
sufficient
when
a
joint
has
received
a
penetrating
wound
it
will
require
the
most
powerful
treatment
and
can
only
be
properly
attended
to
by
a
surgeon
the
patient
friends
will
have
to
use
their
own
judgment
to
a
great
extent
in
these
and
in
many
other
cases
as
to
when
leeches
are
necessary
a
universal
rule
however
without
a
single
exception
always
to
rest
a
joint
after
it
has
been
injured
in
any
way
whatever
to
purge
the
patient
and
to
keep
him
on
low
diet
without
beer
unless
he
has
been
a
very
great
drinker
indeed
in
which
case
he
may
still
be
allowed
to
take
a
little
for
if
the
stimulant
that
a
person
has
been
accustomed
to
in
excess
be
all
taken
away
at
once
he
is
very
likely
to
have
an
attack
of
delirium
tremens
the
quantity
given
should
not
however
be
much
say
a
pint
or
at
the
most
a
pint
and
a
half
a
day
rubbing
the
joint
with
opodeldoc
or
the
application
of
a
blister
to
it
is
of
great
service
in
taking
away
the
thickenings
which
often
remain
after
all
heat
pain
and
redness
have
left
an
injured
joint
great
care
should
be
observed
in
not
using
a
joint
too
quickly
after
it
has
been
injured
when
the
is
the
one
injured
the
arm
should
be
bound
tightly
to
the
body
by
means
of
a
linen
or
flannel
roller
and
the
elbow
raised
when
the
elbow
it
should
be
kept
raised
in
the
straight
position
on
a
pillow
when
the
wrist
it
should
be
raised
on
the
chest
and
suspended
in
a
sling
when
the
knee
it
should
be
kept
in
the
straight
position
and
lastly
when
the
ankle
it
should
be
a
little
raised
on
a
pillow
bruises
lacerations
and
wherever
the
bruise
may
be
or
however
swollen
or
discoloured
the
skin
may
become
two
or
three
applications
of
the
of
kept
to
the
part
by
means
of
lint
will
in
an
hour
or
little
more
remove
all
pain
swelling
and
tenderness
simple
or
clean
cuts
only
require
the
edges
of
the
wound
to
be
placed
in
their
exact
situation
drawn
close
together
and
secured
there
by
one
or
two
slips
of
adhesive
plaster
when
the
wound
however
is
jagged
or
the
flesh
or
cuticle
lacerated
the
parts
are
to
be
laid
as
smooth
and
regular
as
possible
and
a
piece
of
lint
wetted
in
the
of
laid
upon
the
wound
and
a
piece
of
greased
lint
placed
above
it
to
prevent
the
dressing
sticking
the
whole
covered
over
to
protect
from
injury
and
the
part
dressed
in
the
same
manner
once
a
day
till
the
cure
is
effected
bruises
and
their
the
best
application
for
a
bruise
be
it
large
or
small
is
moist
warmth
therefore
a
warm
poultice
in
hot
moist
flannels
should
be
put
on
as
they
supple
the
skin
if
the
bruise
be
very
severe
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
joint
it
will
be
well
to
apply
ten
or
a
dozen
leeches
over
the
whole
bruised
part
and
afterwards
a
poultice
but
leeches
should
not
be
put
on
young
children
if
the
bruised
part
be
the
knee
or
the
ankle
walking
should
not
be
attempted
till
it
can
be
performed
without
pain
inattention
to
this
point
often
lays
the
foundation
for
serious
mischief
in
these
joints
especially
in
the
case
of
scrofulous
persons
in
all
conditions
of
bruises
occurring
in
children
whether
swellings
or
abrasions
no
remedy
is
so
quick
or
certain
of
effecting
a
cure
as
the
pure
extract
of
lead
applied
to
the
part
burns
and
scalds
burns
and
scalds
being
essentially
the
same
in
all
particulars
and
differing
only
in
the
manner
of
their
production
may
be
spoken
of
together
as
a
general
rule
scalds
are
less
severe
than
burns
because
the
heat
of
water
by
which
scalds
are
mostly
produced
is
not
even
when
it
is
boiling
so
intense
as
that
of
flame
oil
however
and
other
liquids
whose
is
high
produce
scalds
of
a
very
severe
nature
burns
and
scalds
have
been
divided
into
three
classes
the
first
class
comprises
those
where
the
burn
is
altogether
superficial
and
merely
reddens
the
skin
the
second
where
the
injury
is
greater
and
we
get
little
bladders
containing
a
fluid
called
serum
dotted
over
the
affected
part
in
the
third
class
we
get
in
the
case
of
burns
a
charring
and
in
that
of
scalds
a
softening
or
pulpiness
perhaps
a
complete
and
immediate
separation
of
the
part
this
may
occur
at
once
or
in
the
course
of
a
little
time
the
pain
from
the
second
kind
of
burns
is
much
more
severe
than
that
in
the
other
two
although
the
danger
as
a
general
rule
is
less
than
it
is
in
the
third
class
these
injuries
are
much
more
dangerous
when
they
take
place
on
the
trunk
than
when
they
happen
on
the
arms
or
legs
the
danger
arises
more
from
the
extent
of
surface
that
is
burnt
than
from
the
depth
to
which
the
burn
goes
this
rule
of
course
has
certain
exceptions
because
a
small
burn
on
the
chest
or
belly
penetrating
deeply
is
more
dangerous
than
a
more
extensive
but
superficial
one
on
the
arm
or
leg
when
a
person
clothes
are
in
flames
the
best
way
of
extinguishing
them
is
to
wind
a
rug
or
some
thick
material
tightly
round
the
whole
of
the
body
of
the
first
class
of
burns
and
the
part
cover
it
immediately
with
a
good
coating
of
common
flour
or
with
flour
dredged
well
into
it
the
great
thing
is
to
keep
the
affected
surface
of
the
skin
from
the
contact
of
the
air
the
part
will
shortly
get
well
and
the
skin
may
or
may
not
peel
if
the
burn
or
scald
is
not
extensive
and
there
is
no
prostration
of
strength
this
is
very
simple
and
consists
in
simply
giving
a
little
aperient
medicine
pills
no
as
follows
mix
grains
of
blue
pill
and
the
same
quantity
of
compound
extract
of
colocynth
and
make
into
two
pills
the
dose
for
a
person
three
hours
after
the
pills
give
a
black
draught
if
there
are
general
symptoms
of
fever
such
as
hot
skin
thirst
headache
two
tablespoonfuls
of
are
to
be
given
every
four
hours
the
we
remind
our
readers
is
made
thus
a
drachm
of
powdered
nitro
drachms
of
carbonate
of
potash
teaspoonfuls
of
antimonial
wine
and
a
tablespoonful
of
sweet
spirits
of
nitro
in
half
a
pint
of
water
class
local
as
the
symptoms
of
these
kinds
of
burns
are
more
severe
than
those
of
the
first
class
so
the
remedies
appropriate
to
them
are
more
powerful
having
as
carefully
as
possible
removed
the
clothes
from
the
burnt
surface
and
taking
care
not
to
break
the
bladders
spread
the
following
liniment
no
on
a
piece
of
linen
or
lint
not
the
side
and
apply
it
to
the
part
the
liniment
should
be
equal
parts
of
and
well
mixed
if
the
burn
is
on
the
trunk
of
the
body
it
is
better
to
use
a
warm
poultice
after
a
few
days
dress
the
wound
with
cerate
if
the
burn
is
at
the
bend
of
the
elbow
place
the
arm
in
the
position
for
if
it
is
the
skin
when
healed
will
be
contracted
and
the
arm
in
all
probability
always
remain
in
the
same
un
natural
position
this
indeed
applies
to
all
parts
of
the
body
therefore
always
place
the
part
affected
in
the
most
position
the
same
kind
of
treatment
is
to
be
used
as
for
the
first
class
only
it
must
be
more
powerful
stimulants
are
move
often
necessary
but
must
be
given
with
great
caution
if
as
is
often
the
case
there
is
great
irritability
and
restlessness
a
dose
of
opium
paregoric
in
doses
of
from
sixty
to
a
hundred
drops
according
to
age
is
best
is
of
great
service
the
feverish
symptoms
will
require
aperient
medicines
and
the
fever
mixture
a
drink
made
of
about
a
tablespoonful
of
cream
of
tartar
and
a
little
in
a
quart
of
warm
water
allowed
to
cool
is
a
very
nice
one
in
these
cases
the
diet
throughout
should
not
be
too
low
especially
if
there
is
much
discharge
from
the
wound
after
a
few
days
it
is
often
necessary
to
give
wine
ammonia
and
strong
these
should
be
had
recourse
to
when
the
tongue
gets
dry
and
dark
and
the
pulse
weak
and
frequent
if
there
should
be
after
the
lapse
of
a
week
or
two
pain
over
one
particular
part
of
the
belly
a
blister
should
be
put
on
it
and
a
powder
of
mercury
and
powder
and
powder
two
grains
of
the
former
and
five
of
the
latter
given
three
times
a
day
affections
of
the
head
and
chest
also
frequently
occur
as
a
consequence
of
these
kinds
of
burns
but
no
one
who
is
not
a
medical
man
can
treat
them
these
are
so
severe
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
a
person
to
be
of
much
service
in
attending
to
them
when
they
occur
a
surgeon
should
always
be
sent
for
until
he
arrives
however
the
following
treatment
should
be
adopted
place
the
patient
on
his
back
and
keep
him
warm
apply
fomentations
of
flannels
wrung
out
of
boiling
water
and
sprinkled
with
spirits
of
turpentine
to
the
part
and
give
wine
and
in
such
quantities
as
the
prostration
of
strength
requires
always
bearing
in
mind
the
great
fact
that
you
have
to
steer
between
two
quicksands
death
from
present
prostration
and
death
from
future
excitement
which
will
always
be
increased
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
stimulants
given
give
therefore
only
just
as
much
as
is
absolutely
necessary
to
keep
life
in
the
body
concussion
of
brain
this
may
be
caused
by
a
blow
or
a
cold
skin
weak
pulse
almost
total
insensibility
slow
weak
breathing
pupil
of
eye
sometimes
bigger
sometimes
smaller
than
natural
inability
to
move
unwillingness
to
answer
when
spoken
to
these
symptoms
come
on
directly
after
the
place
the
patient
quietly
on
a
warm
bed
send
for
a
surgeon
do
nothing
else
for
the
first
four
or
six
after
this
time
the
skin
will
become
hot
the
pulse
full
and
the
patient
feverish
altogether
if
the
surgeon
has
not
arrived
by
the
time
these
symptoms
have
set
in
shave
the
patient
head
and
apply
the
following
lotion
no
mix
half
an
ounce
of
two
tablespoonfuls
of
vinegar
and
the
same
quantity
of
gin
or
whisky
in
half
a
pint
of
water
then
give
this
pill
no
mix
five
grains
of
calomel
and
the
same
quantity
of
antimonial
powder
with
a
little
and
make
into
two
pills
give
a
black
draught
three
hours
after
the
pill
and
two
tablespoonfuls
of
the
every
four
hours
keep
on
low
diet
leeches
are
sometimes
to
be
applied
to
the
head
these
cases
are
often
followed
by
violent
inflammation
of
the
brain
they
can
therefore
only
be
attended
to
properly
throughout
by
a
surgeon
the
great
thing
for
people
to
do
in
these
cases
is
nothing
contenting
themselves
with
putting
the
patient
to
bed
and
waiting
the
arrival
of
a
surgeon
the
cholera
and
autumnal
to
oppose
cholera
there
seems
no
surer
or
better
means
than
cleanliness
sobriety
and
judicious
ventilation
where
there
is
dirt
that
is
the
place
for
cholera
where
windows
and
doors
are
kept
most
jealously
shut
there
cholera
will
find
easiest
entrance
and
people
who
indulge
in
intemperate
diet
during
the
hot
days
of
autumn
are
actually
courting
death
to
repeat
it
cleanliness
sobriety
and
free
ventilation
almost
always
defy
the
pestilence
but
in
case
of
attack
immediate
recourse
should
be
had
to
a
physician
the
faculty
say
that
a
large
number
of
lives
have
been
lost
in
many
seasons
solely
from
delay
in
seeking
medical
assistance
they
even
assert
that
taken
early
the
cholera
is
by
no
means
a
fatal
disorder
the
copious
use
of
salt
is
recommended
on
very
excellent
authority
other
autumnal
complaints
there
are
of
which
diarrhoea
is
the
worst
example
they
come
on
with
pain
flatulence
sickness
with
or
without
vomiting
followed
by
loss
of
appetite
general
lassitude
and
weakness
if
attended
to
at
the
first
appearance
they
may
soon
be
conquered
for
which
purpose
it
is
necessary
to
assist
nature
in
throwing
off
the
contents
of
the
bowels
which
may
be
one
by
means
of
the
following
prescription
take
of
calomel
grains
rhubarb
grains
mix
and
take
it
in
a
little
honey
or
jelly
and
repeat
the
dose
three
times
at
the
intervals
of
four
or
five
hours
the
next
purpose
to
be
answered
is
the
defence
of
the
lining
membrane
of
the
intestines
from
their
acrid
contents
which
will
be
best
effected
by
drinking
copiously
of
linseed
tea
or
of
a
drink
made
by
pouring
boiling
water
on
which
are
of
a
very
mucilaginous
nature
or
what
is
still
better
full
draughts
of
whey
if
the
complaint
continue
after
these
means
have
been
employed
some
astringent
or
binding
medicine
will
be
required
as
the
subjoined
take
of
prepared
chalk
drachms
syrup
of
poppies
oz
mix
and
take
tablespoonfuls
every
four
hours
should
this
fail
to
complete
the
cure
oz
of
tincture
of
catechu
or
of
kino
may
be
added
to
it
and
then
it
will
seldom
fail
or
a
teaspoonful
of
the
tincture
of
kino
alone
with
a
little
water
every
three
hours
till
the
diarrhoea
is
checked
while
any
symptoms
of
derangement
are
present
particular
attention
must
be
paid
to
the
diet
which
should
be
of
a
soothing
lubricating
and
light
nature
as
instanced
in
veal
or
chicken
broth
which
should
contain
but
little
salt
rice
batter
and
bread
puddings
will
be
generally
relished
and
be
eaten
with
advantage
but
the
stomach
is
too
much
impaired
to
digest
food
of
a
more
solid
nature
indeed
we
should
give
that
organ
together
with
the
bowels
as
little
trouble
as
possible
while
they
are
so
incapable
of
acting
in
their
accustomed
manner
much
mischief
is
frequently
produced
by
the
absurd
practice
of
taking
tincture
of
rhubarb
which
is
almost
certain
of
aggravating
that
species
of
disorder
of
which
we
have
now
treated
for
it
is
a
spirit
as
strong
as
brandy
and
can
not
fail
of
producing
harm
upon
a
surface
which
is
rendered
tender
by
the
formation
and
contact
of
vitiated
bile
but
our
last
advice
is
upon
the
first
appearance
of
such
symptoms
as
are
above
detailed
have
recourse
to
a
doctor
where
possible
to
cure
a
put
a
large
teacupful
of
linseed
with
lb
of
sun
raisins
and
oz
of
stick
liquorice
into
quarts
of
soft
water
and
let
it
simmer
over
a
slow
fire
till
reduced
to
one
quart
add
to
it
lb
of
pounded
a
tablespoonful
of
old
rum
and
a
tablespoonful
of
the
best
vinegar
or
the
rum
and
vinegar
should
be
added
as
the
decoction
is
taken
for
if
they
are
put
in
at
first
the
whole
soon
becomes
flat
and
less
efficacious
the
dose
is
half
a
pint
made
warm
on
going
to
bed
and
a
little
may
be
taken
whenever
the
cough
is
troublesome
the
worst

generally
cured
by
this
remedy
in
two
or
three
days

taken
in

fits
fits
come
on
so
suddenly
often
without
even
the
slightest
warning
and
may
prove
fatal
so
quickly
that
all
people
should
be
acquainted
at
least
with
their
leading
symptoms
and
treatment
as
a
few
moments
more
or
less
will
often
decide
the
question
between
life
and
death
the
treatment
in
very
many
cases
at
least
to
be
of
the
slightest
use
should
be
as
a
person
in
a
fit
of
apoplexy
for
instance
may
die
while
a
surgeon
is
being
fetched
from
only
the
next
street
we
shall
give
as
far
as
the
fact
of
our
editing
a
work
for
readers
will
permit
the
peculiar
and
distinctive
symptoms
of
all
kind
of
fits
and
the
immediate
treatment
to
be
adopted
in
each
case
these
fits
may
be
divided
into
two
kinds
the
and
the
strong
these
cases
mostly
occur
in
stout
strong
people
who
are
in
the
habit
of
living
the
patient
may
or
may
not
have
had
headache
sparks
before
his
eyes
with
confusion
of
ideas
and
giddiness
for
a
day
or
two
before
the
attack
when
it
takes
place
he
falls
down
insensible
the
body
becomes
paralyzed
generally
more
so
on
one
side
than
the
other
the
face
and
head
are
hot
and
the
about
them
swollen
the
pupils
of
the
eyes
are
larger
than
natural
and
the
eyes
themselves
are
fixed
the
mouth
is
mostly
drawn
down
at
one
corner
the
breathing
is
like
loud
snoring
the
pulse
full
and
place
the
patient
immediately
in
bed
with
his
head
well
raised
take
off
everything
that
he
has
round
his
neck
and
bleed
freely
and
at
once
from
the
arm
if
you
have
not
got
a
lancet
use
a
penknife
or
anything
suitable
that
may
be
at
hand
apply
warm
mustard
poultices
to
the
soles
of
the
feet
and
the
insides
of
the
thighs
and
legs
put
two
drops
of
castor
oil
mixed
up
with
eight
grains
of
calomel
on
the
top
of
the
tongue
as
far
back
as
possible
a
most
important
part
of
the
treatment
being
to
open
the
bowels
as
quickly
and
freely
as
possible
the
patient
can
not
swallow
but
these
medicines
especially
the
oil
will
be
absorbed
into
the
stomach
altogether
independent
of
any
voluntary
action
if
possible
throw
up
a
warm
turpentine
clyster
two
tablespoonfuls
of
oil
of
turpentine
in
a
pint
of
warm
gruel
or
if
this
can
not
be
obtained
one
composed
of
about
a
quart
of
warm
and
soap
cut
off
the
hair
and
apply
rags
dipped
in
weak
or
weak
or
even
simple
cold
water
to
the
head
if
the
about
the
head
and
neck
are
much
swollen
put
from
eight
to
ten
leeches
on
the
temple
opposite
to
the
paralyzed
side
of
the
body
always
send
for
a
surgeon
immediately
and
act
according
to
the
above
rules
doing
more
or
less
according
to
the
means
at
hand
and
the
length
of
time
that
must
necessarily
elapse
until
he
arrives
a
pint
or
even
a
quart
of
blood
in
a
very
strong
person
may
be
taken
away
when
the
patient
is
able
to
swallow
give
him
the
no
pills
and
the
no
mixture
directly
the
no
pills
are
made
as
follows
mix
grains
of
calomel
and
the
same
quantity
of
antimonial
powder
with
a
little
make
into
two
pills
the
dose
for
a
person
for
the
no
mixture
dissolve
on
ounce
of
epsom
salts
in
half
a
pint
of
senna
tea
take
a
quarter
of
the
mixture
as
a
dose
repeat
these
remedies
if
the
bowels
are
not
well
opened
keep
the
patient
head
well
raised
and
cool
as
above
give
very
low
diet
indeed
gruel
arrowroot
and
the
like
when
a
person
is
recovering
he
should
have
blisters
applied
to
the
nape
of
the
neck
his
bowels
should
be
kept
well
open
light
diet
given
and
fatigue
worry
and
excess
of
all
kinds
avoided
weak
these
attacks
are
more
frequently
preceded
by
warning
symptoms
than
the
first
kind
the
face
is
pale
the
pulse
weak
and
the
body
especially
the
hands
and
legs
cold
after
a
little
while
these
symptoms
sometimes
alter
to
those
of
the
first
class
in
a
mild
at
first
if
the
pulse
is
feeble
a
little
or
must
be
given
mustard
poultices
are
to
be
put
as
before
to
the
soles
of
the
foot
and
the
insides
of
the
thighs
and
legs
warm
bricks
or
bottles
filled
with
warm
water
are
also
to
be
placed
under
the
armpits
when
the
strength
has
returned
the
body
become
warmer
and
the
pulse
fuller
and
harder
the
head
should
be
shaved
and
wet
rags
applied
to
it
as
before
described
leeches
should
be
put
as
before
to
the
temple
opposite
the
side
paralyzed
and
the
bowels
should
be
opened
as
freely
and
as
quickly
as
possible
bleeding
from
the
arm
is
often
necessary
in
these
cases
but
a
person
should
never
have
recourse
to
it
blisters
may
be
applied
to
the
nape
of
the
neck
at
once
the
diet
in
those
cases
should
not
be
so
low
as
in
the
former
indeed
it
is
often
necessary
in
a
day
or
so
after
one
of
these
attacks
to
give
wine
strong
according
to
the
condition
of
the
patient
strength
between
apoplexy
and
apoplexy
mostly
happens
in
people
over
whereas
epilepsy
generally
occurs
under
that
ago
at
any
rate
for
the
first
time
a
person
who
has
epileptic
fits
over
thirty
has
generally
suffered
from
them
for
some
years
again
the
body
is
paralyzed
and
therefore
has
not
convulsions
which
take
place
in
the
peculiar
will
also
distinguish
apoplexy
from
epilepsy
between
apoplexy
and
the
known
habits
of
the
person
the
fact
of
a
person
who
was
perfectly
sober
and
sensible
a
little
time
before
being
found
in
a
state
of
insensibility
the
absence
in
apoplexy
of
the
of
on
applying
the
nose
to
the
mouth
a
person
in
a
fit
of
apoplexy
can
not
be
roused
at
all
in
drunkenness
he
mostly
can
to
a
certain
extent
between
apoplexy
and
hysterics
mostly
happen
in
young
nervous
unmarried
women
and
are
attended
with
convulsions
sobbing
laughter
throwing
about
of
the
body
between
apoplexy
and
poisoning
by
it
is
exceedingly
difficult
to
distinguish
between
these
two
cases
in
poisoning
by
opium
however
we
find
the
particular
smell
of
the
drug
in
the
patient
breath
we
should
also
in
forming
our
opinion
take
into
consideration
the
person
previous
conduct
whether
he
has
been
low
and
desponding
for
some
time
before
or
has
ever
talked
about
committing
suicide
those
fits
mostly
happen
at
any
rate
for
the
first
time
to
young
people
and
are
more
common
in
boys
than
girls
they
are
produced
by
numerous
the
fit
may
be
preceded
by
pains
in
the
head
palpitations
but
it
mostly
happens
that
the
person
falls
down
insensible
suddenly
and
without
any
warning
whatever
the
eyes
are
distorted
so
that
only
their
whites
can
be
seen
there
is
mostly
foaming
from
the
mouth
the
fingers
are
clinched
and
the
body
especially
on
one
side
is
much
agitated
the
tongue
is
often
thrust
out
of
the
mouth
when
the
fit
goes
off
the
patient
feels
drowsy
and
faint
and
often
sleeps
soundly
for
some
during
the
fit
keep
the
patient
flat
on
his
back
with
his
head
slightly
raised
and
prevent
him
from
doing
any
harm
to
himself
dash
cold
water
into
his
face
and
apply
to
his
nose
loosen
his
shirt
collar
hold
a
piece
of
wood
about
as
thick
as
a
finger
the
handle
of
a
or
knife
will
do
as
well
between
the
two
rows
of
teeth
at
the
back
part
of
the
mouth
this
will
prevent
the
tongue
from
being
injured
a
teaspoonful
of
common
salt
thrust
into
the
patient
mouth
during
the
fit
is
of
much
service
the
of
these
fits
is
various
and
depends
entirely
upon
their
causes
a
good
general
rule
however
is
always
to
keep
the
bowels
well
open
and
the
patient
quiet
and
free
from
fatigue
worry
and
excess
of
all
kinds
are
sometimes
very
dangerous
and
at
others
perfectly
harmless
the
question
of
danger
depending
altogether
upon
the
causes
which
have
produced
them
and
which
are
exceedingly
various
for
instance
fainting
produced
by
disease
of
the
heart
is
a
very
serious
symptom
indeed
whereas
that
arising
from
some
slight
cause
such
as
the
sight
of
blood
need
cause
no
alarm
whatever
the
symptoms
of
simple
fainting
are
so
well
known
that
it
would
be
quite
superfluous
to
enumerate
them
here
the
consists
in
laying
the
patient
at
full
length
upon
his
back
with
his
head
upon
a
level
with
the
rest
of
his
body
loosening
everything
about
the
neck
dashing
cold
water
into
the
face
and
sprinkling
vinegar
and
water
about
the
mouth
applying
to
the
nose
and
when
the
patient
is
able
to
swallow
in
giving
a
little
warm
or
about
drops
of
in
water
these
fits
take
place
for
the
most
part
in
young
nervous
unmarried
women
they
happen
much
less
often
in
married
women
and
even
in
some
rare
cases
indeed
in
men
young
women
who
are
subject
to
these
fits
are
apt
to
think
that
they
are
suffering
from
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
and
the
false
symptoms
of
disease
which
they
show
are
so
like
the
true
ones
that
it
is
often
exceedingly
difficult
to
detect
the
difference
the
fits
themselves
are
mostly
preceded
by
great
depression
of
spirits
shedding
of
tears
sickness
palpitation
of
the
heart
a
pain
as
if
a
nail
were
being
driven
in
is
also
often
felt
at
one
particular
part
of
the
head
in
almost
all
cases
when
a
fit
is
coming
on
pain
is
felt
on
the
left
side
this
pain
rises
gradually
until
it
reaches
the
throat
and
then
gives
the
patient
a
sensation
as
if
she
had
a
pellet
there
which
prevents
her
from
breathing
properly
and
in
fact
seems
to
threaten
actual
suffocation
the
patient
now
generally
becomes
insensible
and
faints
the
body
is
thrown
about
in
all
directions
froth
issues
from
the
mouth
incoherent
expressions
are
uttered
and
fits
of
laughter
crying
or
screaming
take
place
when
the
fit
is
going
off
the
patient
mostly
cries
bitterly
sometimes
knowing
all
and
at
others
nothing
of
what
has
taken
place
and
feeling
general
soreness
all
over
the
body
during
the
place
the
body
in
the
same
position
as
for
simple
fainting
and
treat
in
other
respects
as
directed
in
the
article
on
epilepsy
well
loosen
the
patient
and
when
she
is
recovering
and
able
to
swallow
give
drops
of
sal
volatile
in
a
little
water
the
of
these
cases
is
very
various
if
the
patient
is
of
a
strong
constitution
she
should
live
on
plain
diet
take
plenty
of
exercise
and
take
occasional
doses
of
castor
oil
or
an
aperient
mixture
such
as
that
described
as
no
in
previous
numbers
if
as
is
mostly
the
case
the
patient
is
weak
and
delicate
she
will
require
a
different
mode
of
treatment
altogether
good
nourishing
diet
gentle
exercise
cold
baths
occasionally
a
dose
of
no
myrrh
and
aloes
pills
at
night
and
a
dose
of
compound
iron
pills
twice
a
day
as
to
the
myrrh
and
aloes
pills
no
grains
made
into
two
pills
are
a
dose
for
a
person
of
the
compound
iron
pills
no
the
dose
for
a
full
grown
person
is
also
grains
made
into
two
pills
in
every
case
amusing
the
mind
and
avoiding
all
causes
of
are
of
great
service
in
bringing
about
a
permanent
cure
liver
complaint
and
a
very
obliging
correspondent
recommends
the
following
from
personal
experience
take
oz
of
dried
dandelion
root
oz
of
the
best
ginger
oz
of
columba
root
braise
and
boil
all
together
in
pints
of
water
till
it
is
reduced
to
a
quart
strain
and
take
a
every
four
hours
our
correspondent
says
it
is
a
safe
and
simple
medicine
for
both
liver
complaint
and
spasms
a
new
and
successful
mode
of
treating
lumbago
advocated
by
day
is
a
form
of
said
to
have
been
introduced
into
this
country
by
the
late
sir
anthony
carlisle
and
which
consists
in
the
instantaneous
application
of
a
flat
iron
button
gently
heated
in
a
to
the
skin
corrigan
published
about
three
years
ago
an
account
of
some
cases
very
successfully
treated
by
nearly
similar
means
corrigan
plan
was
however
to
touch
the
surface
of
the
part
affected
at
intervals
of
half
an
inch
as
lightly
and
rapidly
as
possible
day
has
found
greater
advantages
to
result
from
drawing
the
flat
surface
of
the
heated
button
lightly
over
the
affected
part
so
as
to
act
on
a
greater
extent
of
surface
the
doctor
speaks
so
enthusiastically
of
the
benefit
to
be
derived
from
this
practice
that
it
is
evidently
highly
deserving
attention
palpitation
of
the
where
palpitation
occurs
as
symptomatic
of
indigestion
the
treatment
must
be
directed
to
remedy
that
disorder
when
it
is
consequent
on
a
plethoric
state
purgatives
will
be
effectual
in
this
case
the
patient
should
abstain
from
every
kind
of
diet
likely
to
produce
a
plethoric
condition
of
body
animal
food
and
fermented
liquor
must
be
particularly
avoided
too
much
indulgence
in
sleep
will
also
prove
injurious
when
the
attacks
arise
from
nervous
irritability
the
excitement
must
be
allayed
by
change
of
air
and
a
tonic
diet
should
the
palpitation
originate
from
organic
derangement
it
must
be
of
course
beyond
domestic
management
luxurious
living
indolence
and
often
produce
this
affection
such
cases
are
to
be
conquered
with
a
little
resolution
poisons

be
the
next
subject
for
remark
and
we
anticipate
more
detailed
instructions
for
the
treatment
of

the
symptoms
of
poisoning
may
be
known
for
the
most
part
from
those
of
some
diseases
which
they
are
very
like
from
the
fact
of
their
coming
on
after
eating
or
drinking
something
whereas
those
of
disease
come
on
in
most
cases
at
least
by
degrees
and
with
warnings
in
most
cases
where
poison
is
known
or
suspected
to
have
been
taken
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
empty
the
stomach
well
and
immediately
by
means
of
mustard
mixed
in
warm
water
or
plain
warm
or
better
this
draught
which
we
call
no
twenty
grains
of
sulphate
of
zinc
in
an
ounce
and
a
half
of
water
this
draught
to
be
repeated
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
if
vomiting
does
not
ensue
the
back
part
of
the
throat
should
be
well
tickled
with
a
feather
or
two
of
the
fingers
thrust
down
it
to
induce
vomiting
the
cases
where
vomiting
must
not
be
used
are
those
where
the
skin
has
been
taken
off
and
the
parts
touched
irritated
and
inflamed
by
the
poison
taken
and
where
the
action
of
vomiting
would
increase
the
evil
full
instructions
are
given
in
the
article
on
each
particular
poison
as
to
where
emetics
are
or
are
not
to
be
given
the
best
and
safest
way
of
emptying
the
stomach
is
by
means
of
the
as
in
certain
cases
the
action
of
vomiting
is
likely
to
increase
the
danger
arising
from
the
swollen
and
congested
condition
of
the
of
the
head
which
often
takes
place
in
the
hands
however
of
any
one
else
than
a
surgeon
it
would
be
not
only
useless
but
harmful
as
a
great
deal
of
dexterity
caution
and
experience
are
required
to
use
it
properly
after
having
made
these
brief
introductory
remarks
we
shall
now
proceed
to
particulars
acid
or
oil
of
a
clear
colourless
liquid
of
an
oily
appearance
in
those
who
have
swallowed
when
much
is
taken
these
come
on
immediately
there
is
great
burning
pain
extending
from
the
mouth
to
the
stomach
vomiting
of
a
liquid
of
a
dark
often
mixed
with
shreds
of
flesh
and
streaks
of
blood
the
skin
inside
the
mouth
is
taken
off
and
the
exposed
surface
is
at
first
white
and
after
a
time
becomes
brownish
there
are
sometimes
spots
of
a
brown
colour
round
the
lips
and
on
the
neck
caused
by
drops
of
the
acid
falling
on
these
parts
there
is
great
difficulty
of
breathing
owing
to
the
swelling
at
the
back
part
of
the
mouth
after
a
time
there
is
much
depression
of
strength
with
a
quick
weak
pulse
and
cold
clammy
skin
the
face
is
pale
and
has
a
very
anxious
look
when
the
acid
swallowed
has
been
greatly
diluted
in
water
the
same
kind
of
symptoms
occur
only
in
a
milder
give
a
mixture
of
magnesia
in
or
if
this
can
not
be
obtained
of
finely
powdered
chalk
or
whiting
or
even
of
the
plaster
torn
down
from
the
walls
or
ceiling
in
the
mixture
should
be
nearly
as
thick
as
cream
and
plenty
of
it
given
as
well
as
this
simple
gruel
milk
or
thick
are
very
useful
and
should
be
given
in
large
quantities
violent
inflammation
of
the
parts
touched
by
the
acid
is
most
likely
to
take
place
in
the
coarse
of
a
little
time
and
can
only
be
properly
attended
to
by
a
surgeon
but
if
one
can
not
be
obtained
leeches
the
the
recipe
for
which
appears
repeatedly
in
previous
paragraphs
thick
drinks
such
as
gruel
arrowroot
must
be
had
recourse
to
according
to
the
symptoms
of
each
particular
case
and
the
means
at
hand
the
inflamed
condition
of
the
back
part
of
the
mouth
requires
particular
attention
when
the
breathing
is
very
laboured
and
difficult
in
consequence
from
fifteen
to
twenty
leeches
are
to
be
immediately
applied
to
the
outside
of
the
throat
and
when
they
drop
off
warm
poppy
fomentations
constantly
kept
to
the
part
when
the
pain
over
the
stomach
is
very
great
the
same
local
treatment
is
necessary
but
if
it
is
only
slight
a
good
mustard
poultice
will
be
sufficient
without
the
leeches
in
all
these
cases
two
tablespoonfuls
of
the
should
be
given
every
four
hours
and
only
gruel
or
arrowroot
allowed
to
be
eaten
for
some
days
commonly
known
as
or
spirit
of
a
fluid
of
the
consistence
of
water
and
which
gives
off
dense
white
fumes
on
exposure
to
the
air
produced
in
those
who
have
swallowed
much
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
sulphuric
acid
in
this
case
however
the
surface
touched
by
the
acid
becomes
the
tongue
is
mostly
much
the
same
as
for
sulphuric
acid
acid
spirit
of
a
thin
yellow
fluid
emitting
dense
white
fumes
on
exposure
to
the
air
this
is
not
often
taken
as
a
poison
the
and
are
much
the
same
as
those
of
no
case
of
poisoning
by
these
three
acids
should
emetics
ever
be
commonly
called
of
this
poison
may
be
taken
by
mistake
for
epsom
salts
which
it
is
a
good
deal
like
it
may
be
distinguished
from
them
by
its
very
acid
taste
and
its
shape
which
is
that
of
crystals
each
of
which
if
put
into
a
drop
of
ink
will
turn
it
to
a
reddish
brown
whereas
epsom
salts
will
not
change
its
colour
at
all
when
a
large
dose
of
this
poison
has
been
taken
death
takes
place
very
quickly
produced
in
those
who
have
swallowed
a
hot
burning
acid
taste
is
felt
in
the
act
of
swallowing
and
vomiting
of
a
fluid
is
produced
sooner
or
later
according
to
the
quantity
and
strength
of
the
poison
taken
there
is
great
tenderness
felt
over
the
stomach
followed
by
clammy
perspirations
and
convulsions
the
legs
are
often
drawn
up
and
there
is
generally
stupor
from
which
the
patient
however
can
easily
be
roused
and
always
great
prostration
of
strength
the
pulse
is
small
and
weak
and
the
breathing
chalk
or
magnesia
made
into
a
cream
with
water
should
be
given
in
large
quantities
and
afterwards
the
emetic
draught
above
prescribed
or
some
if
the
draught
can
not
be
got
the
back
part
of
the
throat
to
be
tickled
with
a
feather
to
induce
vomiting
arrowroot
gruel
and
the
like
drinks
are
to
be
taken
when
the
prostration
of
strength
is
very
great
and
the
body
cold
warmth
is
to
be
applied
to
it
and
a
little
or
and
water
given
a
thin
transparent
and
colourless
liquid
with
a
peculiar
smell
which
greatly
resembles
that
of
bitter
almonds
produced
in
those
who
have
swallowed
these
come
on
after
the
poison
has
been
taken
and
may
be
produced
by
merely
it
the
patient
becomes
perfectly
insensible
and
falls
down
in
convulsions
his
eyes
are
fixed
and
staring
the
pupils
being
bigger
than
natural
the
skin
is
cold
and
clammy
the
pulse
scarcely
perceptible
and
the
breathing
slow
and
very
little
can
be
done
in
these
cases
as
death
takes
place
so
quickly
after
the
poison
has
been
swallowed
when
it
takes
place
at
all
the
best
treatment
which
should
always
be
adopted
in
all
cases
even
though
the
patient
appears
quite
to
dash
quantities
of
cold
water
on
the
back
from
the
top
of
the
neck
downwards
placing
the
patient
under
a
pump
and
pumping
on
him
is
the
best
way
of
doing
this
are
also
to
be
applied
to
the
nose
and
the
chest
well
rubbed
with
a
camphor
liniment
alkalis
and
or
common
with
their
principal
preparations
soap
lees
liquor
potassae
nitre
sal
prunella
and
alkalis
are
seldom
taken
or
given
with
the
view
of
destroying
life
they
may
however
be
swallowed
by
produced
in
those
who
have
swallowed
there
is
at
first
a
burning
acrid
taste
in
and
a
sensation
of
tightness
round
the
throat
like
that
of
strangling
the
skin
touched
is
destroyed
retching
mostly
followed
by
actual
vomiting
then
sets
in
the
vomited
matters
often
containing
blood
of
a
dark
brown
colour
with
little
shreds
of
flesh
here
and
there
and
always
changing
vegetable
blue
colours
green
there
is
now
great
tenderness
over
the
whole
of
the
belly
after
a
little
while
great
weakness
with
cold
clammy
sweats
a
quick
weak
pulse
and
purging
of
bloody
matters
takes
place
the
brain
too
mostly
becomes
give
two
tablespoonfuls
of
vinegar
or
in
a
glassful
of
water
every
few
minutes
until
the
burning
sensation
is
relieved
any
kind
of
oil
or
milk
may
also
be
given
and
will
form
soap
when
mixed
with
the
poison
in
the
stomach
gruel
arrowroot
are
also
very
useful
and
should
be
taken
constantly
and
in
large
quantities
if
inflammation
should
take
place
it
is
to
be
treated
by
applying
leeches
and
warm
poppy
fomentations
to
the
part
where
the
pain
is
most
felt
and
giving
two
tablespoonfuls
of
the
fever
mixture
every
four
hours
the
diet
in
all
these
cases
should
only
consist
of
arrowroot
or
gruel
for
the
first
few
days
and
then
of
weak
broth
or
for
some
time
after
when
very
strong
fumes
of
have
in
any
way
been
inhaled
there
is
great
difficulty
of
breathing
and
alarming
pain
in
the
mouth
and
nostrils
in
this
case
let
the
patient
inhale
the
steam
of
warm
vinegar
and
treat
the
feverish
symptoms
as
before
mostly
seen
under
the
form
of
white
arsenic
or
and
yellow
arsenic
or
king
produced
in
those
who
have
swallowed
these
vary
very
much
according
to
the
form
and
dose
in
which
the
poison
has
been
taken
there
is
faintness
depression
and
sickness
with
an
intense
burning
pain
in
the
region
of
the
stomach
which
gets
worse
and
worse
and
is
increased
by
pressure
there
is
also
vomiting
of
dark
brown
matter
sometimes
mixed
with
blood
and
mostly
great
thirst
with
a
feeling
of
tightness
round
and
of
burning
in
the
throat
purging
also
takes
place
the
matters
brought
away
being
mixed
with
blood
the
pulse
is
small
and
irregular
and
the
skin
sometimes
cold
and
clammy
and
at
others
hot
the
breathing
is
painful
convulsions
and
spasms
often
give
a
couple
of
teaspoonfuls
of
mustard
in
a
glass
of
water
to
bring
on
or
assist
vomiting
and
also
use
the
other
means
elsewhere
recommended
for
the
purpose
a
solution
half
of
and
half
of
well
mixed
may
be
given
as
well
as
plenty
of
arrowroot
gruel
or
simple
milk
is
also
useful
a
little
should
be
given
to
cleanse
the
intestines
of
all
the
poison
and
the
treated
on
general
principles
mostly
seen
in
the
form
of
little
heavy
crystalline
masses
which
melt
in
water
and
have
a
metallic
taste
it
is
sometimes
seen
in
powder
this
is
a
most
powerful
these
mostly
come
on
immediately
after
the
poison
has
been
taken
there
is
a
coppery
taste
experienced
in
the
act
of
swallowing
with
a

tightness
round
the

in
a
few
minutes
great
pain
is
felt
over
the

of

are
very
bad
symptoms

of
the

is
more

mix
the
whites
of
a
dozen
eggs
in
two
pints
of
cold
water
and
give
a
glassful
of
the
mixture
every
three
or
four
minutes
until
the

can
contain
no
more
if
vomiting
does
not
now
come
on
naturally
and
supposing
the

is
not
very
sore
or
much
swollen
an
emetic
draught
no
may
be
given
and
vomiting
induced
the
no
draught
we
remind
our
readers
is
thus
made
twenty
grains
of
sulphate
of
zinc
in
an
ounce
and
a
half
of

can
not
be
obtained

or
should
be
given
as
a
substitute
for
them
at
once
when
the
depression
of
strength
is
very
great
indeed
a
little
warm
must
be
given
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
two
the
patient
should
take
two
tablespoonfuls
of
and
if
inflammation
comes
on
it
is
to
be
treated
as
directed
in
the
article
on
acids
and
alkalis
the
diet
should
also
be
the
same
if
the
patient
recovers
great
soreness
of
the
gums
is
almost
certain
to
take
place
the
simplest
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
best
modes
of
treatment
is
to
wash
them
well
three
or
four
times
a
day
with
a
heavy
white
powder
without
taste
and
insoluble
in
water
it
has
been
occasionally
known
to
destroy
much
the
same
as
in
the
case
of
corrosive
the
same
as
for
corrosive
sublimate
if
the
gums
are
sore
wash
them
as
recommended
in
the
case
of
corrosive
sublimate
with
three
or
four
times
a
day
and
keep
the
patient
on
such
as
arrowroot
gruel
broth
or
according
to
the
other
symptoms
eating
hard
substances
would
make
the
gums
more
sore
and
tender
the
preparations
of
this
metal
which
are
most
likely
to
be
the
ones
producing
poisonous
symptoms
are
and
people
are
often
taken
ill
after
eating
food
that
has
been
cooked
in
copper
saucepans
when
anything
has
been
cooked
in
one
of
these
vessels

never
be
allowed
to

as
arrowroot
and
gruel
seen
in
the
form
of
a
white
powder
or
crystals
with
a
slightly
metallic
taste
it
has
not
often
been
known
to
destroy
a
strong
metallic
taste
in
the
act
of
swallowing
followed
by
a
burning

rapid
the

is
also
great

by
giving
plenty
of
warm
water
or
warm

in
large
quantities

be
drunk
or
if
it
can
be
obtained
a
decoction
of
oak
bark
the
is
the
same
as
that
for
acids
and
alkalis
the
principal
object
in
all
these
cases
being
to
keep
down
the
inflammation
of
the
parts
touched
by
the
poison
by
means
of
leeches
warm
poppy
fomentations
and
very
low
diet
and
its
preparations
of
lead
goulard
extract
white
lead
is
by
no
means
an
active
poison
although
it
is
popularly
considered
to
be
so
it
mostly
affects
people
by
being
taken
into
the
system
slowly
as
in
the
case
of
painters
and
glaziers
a
house
too
often
affects
those
living
in
produced
when
taken
in
a
large

is
at
first
a
burning
pricking
sensation
in
the
throat
to
which
thirst
giddiness
and
vomiting
follow
the
belly
is
tight
swollen
and
painful
pain
being
relieved
by
the
bowels
are
mostly
bound
there
is
great
depression
of
strength
and
a
cold
treatment
give
an
emetic
draught
no
see
above
at
once
and
shortly
afterwards
a
solution
of
epsom
salts
in
large
quantities
a
little
must
be
taken
if
the
depression
of
strength
is
very
great
indeed
milk
whites
of
eggs
and
arrowroot
are
also
useful
after
two
or
three
hours
cleanse
the
stomach
and
intestines
well
out
with
two
tablespoonfuls
of
and
treat
the
symptoms
which
follow
according
to
the
rules
laid
down
in
other
parts
of
these
when
it

languid
there
is
also
sometimes
a
difficulty
in
give
five
grains
of
calomel
and
half
a
grain
of
opium
directly
in
the
form
of
a
pill
and
half
an
ounce
of
epsom
salts
in
two
hours
and
repeat
this
treatment
until
the
bowels
are
well
opened
put
the
patient
into
a
warm
bath
and
throw
up
a
clyster
of
warmish
water
when
he
is
in
it
fomentations
of
warm
oil
of
turpentine
if
they
can
be
obtained
should
be
put
over
the
whole
of
the
belly
the
great
object
is
to
open
the
bowels
as
freely
and
as
quickly
as
possible
when
this
has
been
done
a
grain
of
pure
opium
may
be
given
arrowroot
or
gruel
should
be
taken
in
good
large
quantities
the
must
depend
altogether
upon
the
symptoms
of
each
particular
case
and
its
preparations
solid
opium
is
mostly
seen
in
the
form
of
rich
brown
flattish
cakes
with
little
pieces
of
leaves
sticking
on
them
here
and
there
and
a
bitter
and
slightly
warm
taste
the
most
common
form
in
which
it
is
taken
as
a
poison
is
that
of
these
consist
at
first
in
giddiness
and
stupor
followed
by
insensibility
the
patient
however
being
roused
to
consciousness
by
a
great
noise
so
as
to
be
able
to
answer
a
question
but
becoming
insensible
again
almost
immediately
the
pulse
is
now
quick
and
small
the
breathing
hurried
and
the
skin
warm
and
covered
with
perspiration
after
a
little
time
these
symptoms
change
the
person
becomes
the
breathing
slow
and
as
in
apoplexy
the
skin
cold
and
the
pulse
slow
and
full
the
pupil
of
the
eye
is
mostly
smaller
than
natural

applying
his
nose
to
the

the

the
open
air
for
two
or
three
hours
the
great
thing
being
to
keep
him
from
sleeping
electricity
is
of
much
service
when
the
patient
is
recovering
mustard
poultices
should
be
applied
to
the
soles
of
the
feet
and
the
insides

given
to
children
by
their
nurses
and
mothers
for
the
purpose
of
making
them

prove
fatal
of
and
the
author
would
most
earnestly
urge
all
people
caring
for
their
children
lives
never
to
allow
any
of
these
preparations
to
be
given
unless
ordered
by
a
surgeon
the
treatment
in
the
case
of
poisoning
by
and
is
much
the
same
as
that
for
opium
vomiting
should
be
brought
on
in
all
of
them
it
sometimes
happens
that
things
which
are
in
daily
use
and
mostly
perfectly
harmless
give
rise
under
certain
unknown
circumstances
and
in
certain
individuals
to
the
symptoms
of
poisoning
the
most
common
articles
of
food
of
this
description
are
and
certain
kinds
of
and
the
general
symptoms
are
thirst
weight
about
the
stomach
difficulty
of
breathing
vomiting
purging
spasms
prostration
of
strength
and
in
the
case
of
mussels
more
particularly
an
eruption
on
the
body
like
that
of
empty
the
stomach
well
with
no
draught
and
warm
water
and
give
two
tablespoonfuls
of
immediately
after
let
the
patient
take
plenty
of
arrowroot
gruel
and
the
like
drinks
and
if
there
is
much
depression
of
strength
give
a
little
warm
should
symptoms
of
fever
or
inflammation
follow
they
must
be
treated
as
directed
in
the
articles
on
other
kinds
of
poisoning
and
similar
kinds
of
vegetables
often
produce
poisonous
effects
the
symptoms
are
various
sometimes
giddiness
and
stupor
and
at
others
pain
in
and
swelling
of
the
belly
with
vomiting
and
purging
being
the
leading
ones
when
the
symptoms
come
on
quickly
after
taking
the
poison
it
is
generally
the
head
that
is
the
treatment
consists
in
bringing
on
vomiting
in
the
usual
manner
as
quickly
and
as
freely
as
possible
the
other

are
to
be
treated

these
external
remedies
the

every
morning
or
if
they
act
too
much
on

and
into
powders
for
a

from

where
the
patient
is
older
the
strength
may
be
increased
by
enlarging
the
quantities
of
the
drugs
ordered
or
by
giving
one
and
a
half
or
two
powders
for
one
dose
the
ointment
is
to
be
well
washed
off
every
morning
with
and
the

bathed
with
the

an
imperative
fact
must
be
remembered
by
mother
or
nurse
never
to
use
the
same
comb
employed
for
the
child
with
ringworm
for
the
healthy
children
or
let
the
affected
little
one
sleep
with
those
free
from
the
disease
and
for
fear
of
any
contact
by
hands
or
otherwise
to
keep
the
child
head
enveloped
in
a
nightcap
till
this
eruption
is
completely
cured
trifling
as
scratches
often
seem
they
ought
never
to
be
neglected
but
should
be
covered
and
protected
and
kept
clean
and
dry
until
they
have
completely
healed
if
there
is
the
least
appearance
of
inflammation
no
time
should
be
lost
in
applying
a
large
poultice
or
hot
flannels
repeatedly
applied
or
even
leeches
in
good
numbers
may
be
put
on
at
some
distance
from
each
other
for
shortness
of
breath
or
difficult
vitriolated
spirits
of
ether
camphor
grains
make
a
solution
of
which
take
a
teaspoonful
during
the
paroxysm
this
is
found
to
afford
instantaneous
relief
in
difficulty
of
breathing
depending
on
internal
diseases
and
other
causes
where
the
patient
from
a
very
quick
and
laborious
breathing
is
obliged
to
be
in
an
erect
posture
a
sprain
is
a
stretching
of
the
leaders
or
ligaments
of
a
part
through
some
violence
such
as
slipping
falling
on
the
hands
pulling
a
limb
the
most
common
are
those
of
the
ankle
and
wrist
these
accidents
are
more
serious
than
people
generally
suppose
and
often
more
difficult
to
cure
than
a
broken
log
or
arm
the
first
thing
to
be
done
is
to
place
the
sprained
part
in
the
straight
position
and
to
raise
it
a
little
as
well
some
recommend
the
application
of
cold
lotions
at
first
the
editress
however
is
quite
convinced
that
warm
applications
are
in
most
cases
the
best
for
for
the
first
three
or
four
days
these
fomentations
are
to
be
applied
in
the
following
manner
dip
a
piece
of
flannel
into
a
pail
or
basin
full
of
hot
water
or
hot
poppy
fomentation
six
poppy
heads
boiled
in
one
quart
of
water
for
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
wring
it
almost
dry
and
apply
it
as
hot
as
the
patient
can
bear
right
round
the
sprained
part
then
place
another
piece
of
flannel
quite
dry
over
it
in
order
that
the
steam
and
warmth
may
not
escape
this
process
should
be
repeated
as
often
as
the
patient
feels
that
the
flannel
next
to
his
skin
is
getting
cold
the
oftener
the
better
the
bowels
should
be
opened
with
a
black
draught
and
the
patient
kept
on
low
diet
if
he
has
been
a
great
drinker
he
may
be
allowed
to
take
a
little
beer
but
it
is
better
not
to
do
so
a
little
of
the
cream
of
tartar
drink
ordered
in
the
case
of
burns
may
be
taken
occasionally
if
there
is
much
thirst
when
the
swelling
and
tenderness
about
the
joint
are
very
great
from
eight
to
twelve
leeches
may
be
applied
when
the
knee
is
the
joint
affected
the
greatest
pain
is
felt
at
the
inside
and
therefore
the
greater
quantity
of
the
leeches
should
be
applied
to
that
part
when
the
shoulder
is
sprained
the
arm
should
be
kept
close
to
the
body
by
means
of
a
linen
roller
which
is
to
be
taken
four
or
five
times
round
the
whole
of
the
chest
it
should
also
be
brought
two
or
three
times
underneath
the
elbow
in
order
to
raise
the
shoulder
this
is
the
best
treatment
for
these
accidents
during
the
first
three
or
four
days
after
that
time
supposing
that
no
unfavourable
symptoms
have
taken
place
a
cold
lotion
composed
of
a
tablespoonful
of
to
a
quart
of
water
or
should
be
constantly
applied
this
lotion
will
strengthen
the
part
and
also
help
in
taking
away
any
thickening
that
may
have
formed
about
the
joint
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
weeks
according
to
circumstances
the
joint
is
to
be
rubbed
twice
a
day
with
flannel
dipped
in
opodeldoc
a
flannel
bandage
rolled
tightly
round
the
joint
the
pressure
being
greatest
at
the
lowest
part
and
the
patient
allowed
to
walk
about
with
the
assistance
of
a
crutch
or
stick
he
should
also
occasionally
when
sitting
or
lying
down
quietly
bend
the
joint
backwards
and
forwards
to
cause
its
natural
motion
to
return
and
to
prevent
stiffness
from
taking
place
when
the
swelling
is
very
great
immediately
after
the
accident
has
occurred
from
the
breaking
of
the
it
is
best
to
apply
cold
applications
at
first
if
it
can
be
procured
may
be
put
over
the
flannel
instead
of
the
dry
piece
of
flannel
old
flannel
is
better
than
new
cure
for
where
there
is
no
malformation
of
the
organs
of
articulation
stammering
may
be
remedied
by
reading
aloud
with
the
teeth
closed
this
should
be
practised
for
two
hours
a
day
for
three
or
four
months
the
advocate
of
this
simple
remedy
says
i
can
speak
with
certainty
of
its
utility
at
a
recent
meeting
of
the
boston
society
of
natural
history
warren
stated
a
simple
easy
and
effectual
cure
of
stammering
it
is
simply
at
every
syllable
pronounced
to
tap
at
the
same
time
with
the
finger
by
so
doing
the
most
inveterate
stammerer
will
be
surprised
to
find
that
he
can
pronounce
quite
fluently
and
by
long
and
constant
practice
he
will
pronounce
perfectly
well
suffocation
suffocation
may
arise
from
many
different
causes
anything
which
prevents
the
air
getting
into
the
lungs
will
produce
it
we
shall
give
the
principal
causes
and
the
treatment
to
be
followed
in
each
case
acid
gas
of
this
poisonous
gas
is
met
with
in
rooms
where
charcoal
is
burnt
and
where
there
is
not
sufficient
draught
to
allow
it
to
escape
in
coalpits
near
limekilns
in
breweries
and
in
rooms
and
houses
where
a
great
many
people
live
huddled
together
in
wretchedness
and
filth
and
where
the
air
in
consequence
becomes
poisoned
this
gas
gives
out
no
smell
so
that
we
can
not
know
of
its
presence
a
candle
will
not
burn
in
a
room
which
contains
much
of
at
first
there
is
giddiness
and
a
great
wish
to
sleep
after
a
little
time
or
where
there
is
much
of
it
present
a
person
feels
great
weight
in
the
head
and
stupid
gets
by
degrees
quite
unable
to
move
and
snores
as
if
in
a
deep
sleep
the
limbs
may
or
may
not
be
stiff
the
heat
of
the
body
remains
much
the
same
at
remove
the
person
affected
into
the
open
air
and
even
though
it
is
cold
weather
take
off
his
clothes
then
lay
him
on
his
back
with
his
head
slightly
raised
having
done
this
dash
over
the
whole
of
the
body
and
rub
it
hard
especially
the
face
and
chest
with
towels
dipped
in
the
same
mixture
the
hands
and
feet
also
should
be
rubbed
with
a
hard
brush
apply
to
the
nose
which
may
be
tickled
with
a
feather
dashing
cold
water
down
the
middle
of
the
back
is
of
great
service
if
the
person
can
swallow
give
him
a
little
or
to
drink
the
principal
means
however
to
be
employed
in
this
as
in
fact
in
most
cases
of
apparent
suffocation
is
what
is
called
this
operation
should
be
performed
by
three
persons
and
in
the
following
manner
the
first
person
should
put
the
nozzle
of
a
common
pair
of
bellows
into
one
of
the
patient
nostrils
the
second
should
push
down
and
then
thrust
back
that
part
of
the
throat
called
adam
apple
and
the
third
should
first
raise
and
then
depress
the
chest
one
hand
being
placed
over
each
side
of
the
ribs
these
three
actions
should
be
performed
in
the
following
order
first
of
all
the
throat
should
be
drawn
down
and
thrust
back
then
the
chest
should
be
raised
and
the
bellows
gently
blown
into
the
nostril
directly
this
is
done
the
chest
should
be
depressed
so
as
to
imitate
common
breathing
this
process
should
be
repeated
about
eighteen
times
a
minute
the
mouth
and
the
other
nostril
should
be
closed
while
the
bellows
are
being
blown
persevere
if
necessary
with
this
treatment
for
seven
or
eight
hours
in
fact
till
absolute
signs
of
death
are
visible
many
lives
are
lost
by
giving
it
up
too
quickly
when
the
patient
becomes
roused
he
is
to
be
put
into
a
warm
bed
and
a
little
or
twenty
drops
of
given
cautiously
now
and
then
this
treatment
is
to
be
adopted
in
all
cases
where
people
are
affected
from
breathing
bad
air
smells
this
is
one
of
the
most
frequent
causes
of
death
by
treatment
many
methods
have
been
adopted
and
as
some
of
them
are
not
only
useless
but
hurtful
we
will
mention
them
here
merely
in
order
that
they
may
be
avoided
in
the
first
place
then
never
hang
a
person
up
by
his
heels
as
it
is
an
error
to
suppose
that
water
gets
into
the
lungs
hanging
a
person
up
by
his
heels
would
be
quite
as
bad
as
hanging
him
up
by
his
neck
it
is
also
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
rubbing
the
body
with
salt
and
water
is
of
directly
a
person
has
been
taken
out
of
the
water
he
should
be
wiped
dry
and
wrapped
in
blankets
but
if
these
can
not
be
obtained
the
clothes
of
the
bystanders
must
be
used
for
the
purpose
his
head
being
slightly
raised
and
any
water
weeds
or
froth
that
may
happen
to
be
in
his
mouth
having
been
removed
he
should
be
carried
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
nearest
house
he
should
now
be
put
into
a
warm
bath
about
as
hot
as
the
hand
can
pleasantly
bear
and
kept
there
for
about
ten
minutes
artificial
breathing
being
had
recourse
to
while
he
is
in
it
having
been
taken
out
of
the
bath
he
should
be
placed
flat
on
his
back
with
his
head
slightly
raised
upon
a
warm
bed
in
a
warm
room
wiped
perfectly
dry
and
then
rubbed
constantly
all
over
the
body
with
warm
flannels
at
the
same
time
mustard
poultices
should
be
put
to
the
soles
of
the
feet
the
palms
of
the
hands
and
the
inner
surface
of
the
thighs
and
legs
warm
bricks
or
bottles
filled
with
warm
water
should
be
placed
under
the
armpits
the
nose
should
be
tickled
with
a
feather
and
applied
to
it
this
treatment
should
be
adopted
while
the
bath
is
being
got
ready
as
well
as
when
the
body
has
been
taken
out
of
it
the
bath
is
not
absolutely
necessary
constantly
rubbing
the
body
with
flannels
in
a
warm
room
having
been
found
sufficient
for
resuscitation
sir
brodie
says
that
warm
air
is
quite
as
good
as
warm
water
when
symptoms
of
returning
consciousness
begin
to
show
themselves
give
a
little
wine
brandy
or
twenty
drops
of
and
water
in
some
cases
it
is
necessary
in
about
twelve
or
hours
after
the
patient
has
revived
to
bleed
him
for
peculiar
which
now
and
then
occur
bleeding
however
even
in
the
hands
of
professional
men
themselves
should
be
very
cautiously
used
ones
should
never
think
of
it
the
best
thing
to
do
in
these
cases
is
to
keep
the
head
well
raised
and
cool
with
a
lotion
such
as
that
recommended
above
for
sprains
to
administer
an
aperient
draught
and
to
abstain
from
giving
anything
that
stimulates
such
as
wine
brandy
as
a
general
rule
a
person
dies
in
three
minutes
and
a
half
after
he
has
been
under
water
it
is
difficult
however
to
tell
how
long
he
has
actually
been
it
although
we
may
know
well
exactly
how
long
he
has
been
it
this
being
the
case
always
persevere
in
your
attempts
at
resuscitation
until
actual
signs
of
death
have
shown
themselves
even
for
six
eight
or
ten
hours
douglas
of
glasgow
resuscitated
a
person
who
had
been
under
water
for
fourteen
minutes
by
simply
rubbing
the
whole
of
his
body
with
warm
flannels
in
a
warm
room
for
eight
hours
and
a
half
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
person
began
to
show
the
symptoms
of
returning
animation
should
the
accident
occur
at
a
great
distance
from
any
house
this
treatment
should
be
adopted
as
closely
as
the
circumstances
will
permit
of
breathing
through
any
tube
such
as
a
piece
of
card
or
paper
rolled
into
the
form
of
a
pipe
will
do
as
a
substitute
for
the
bellows

with

or
when
recovering
and
till
actual
signs
of
death
are
briefly
to
conclude
what
we
have
to
say
of
suffocation
let
us
treat
of
when
a
person
has
been
struck
by
lightning
there
is
a
general
paleness
of
the
whole
body
with
the
exception
of
the
part
struck
which
is
often
blackened
or
even
same
as
for
drowning
it
is
not
however
of
much
use
for
when
death
takes
place
at
all
it
is
generally
instantaneous
cure
for
the
take
a
piece
of
sheet
zinc
about
the
size
of
a
sixpence
and
a
piece
of
silver
say
a
shilling
place
them
together
and
hold
the
defective
tooth
between
them
or
contiguous
to
them
in
a
few
minutes
the
pain
will
be
gone
as
if
by
magic
the
zinc
and
silver
acting
as
a
galvanic
battery
will
produce
on
the
nerves
of
the
tooth
sufficient
electricity
to
establish
a
current
and
consequently
to
relieve
the
pain
or
smoke
a
pipe
of
tobacco
and
again
a
small
piece
of
the
pellitory
root
will
by
the
flow
of
saliva
it
causes
afford
relief
creosote
or
a
few
drops
of
tincture
of
myrrh
or
friar
balsam
on
cotton
put
on
the
tooth
will
often
subdue
the
pain
a
small
piece
of
camphor
however
retained
in
the
mouth
is
the
most
reliable
and
likely
means
of
conquering
the
paroxysms
of
this
dreaded
enemy
eisenberg
says
in
his
advice
on
the
hand
that
the
hydrochlorate
of
lime
is
the
most
certain
means
of
destroying
warts
the
process
however
is
very
slow
and
demands
perseverance
for
if
discontinued
before
the
proper
time
no
advantage
is
gained
the
following
is
a
simple
cure
on
breaking
the
stalk
of
the
crowfoot
plant
in
two
a
drop
of
milky
juice
will
be
observed
to
hang
on
the
upper
part
of
the
stem
if
this
be
allowed
to
drop
on
a
wart
so
that
it
be
well
saturated
with
the
juice
in
about
three
or
four
dressings
the
warts
will
die
and
may
be
taken
off
with
the
fingers
they
may
be
removed
by
the
above
means
from
the
teats
of
cows
where
they
are
sometimes
very
troublesome
and
prevent
them
standing
quiet
to
be
milked
the
wart
touched
lightly
every
second
day
with
lunar
caustic
or
rubbed
every
night
with
for
a
few
weeks
will
destroy
the
largest
wart
wherever
situated
to
cure
a
as
soon
as
the
whitlow
has
risen
distinctly
a
pretty
large
piece
should
be
snipped
out
so
that
the
watery
matter
may
readily
escape
and
continue
to
flow
out
as
fast
as
produced
a
poultice
should
be
put
on
for
a
few
days
when
the
wound
should
be
bound
up
lightly
with
some
mild
ointment
when
a
cure
will
be
speedily
completed
constant
poulticing
both
before
and
after
the
opening
of
the
whitlow
is
the
only
practice
needed
but
as
the
matter
lies
deep
when
it
is
necessary
to
open
the
abscess
the
incision
must
be
made
to
reach
the
suppuration
there
are
several
kinds
of
wounds
which
are
called
by
different
names
according
to
their
appearance
or
the
manner
in
which
they
are
produced
as
however
it
would
be
useless
and
even
hurtful
to
bother
the
reader
head
with
too
many
nice
professional
distinctions
we
shall
content
ourselves
with
dividing
wounds
into
three
classes
wounds
or
those
produced
by
a
knife
or
some
sharp
instrument
or
torn
those
produced
by
the
claws
of
an
animal
the
bite
of
a
dog
running
quickly
against
some
projecting
blunt
object
such
as
a
nail
or
penetrating
those
produced
by
anything
running
deeply
into
the
flesh
such
as
a
sword
a
sharp
nail
a
spike
the
point
of
a
bayonet
class
wounds
or
the
danger
arising
from
these
accidents
is
owing
more
to
their
position
than
to
their
extent
thus
a
cut
of
half
an
inch
long
which
goes
through
an
artery
is
more
serious
than
a
cut
of
two
inches
long
which
is
not
near
one
again
a
small
cut
on
the
head
is
more
often
followed
by
dangerous
symptoms
than
a
much
larger
one
on
the
if
the
cut
is
not
a
very
large
one
and
no
artery
or
vein
is
wounded
this
is
very
simple
if
there
are
any
foreign
substances
left
in
the
wound
they
must
be
taken
out
and
the
bleeding
must
be
quite
stopped
before
the
wound
is
strapped
up
if
the
bleeding
is
not
very
great
it
may
easily
be
stopped
by
raising
the
cut
part
and
applying
rags
dipped
in
cold
water
to
it
all
clots
of
blood
must
be
carefully
removed
for
if
they
are
left
behind
they
prevent
the
wound
from
healing
when
the
bleeding
has
been
stopped
and
the
wound
perfectly
cleaned
its
two
edges
are
to
be
brought
closely
together
by
thin
straps
of
common
adhesive
plaster
which
should
remain
on
if
there
is
not
great
pain
or
heat
about
the
part
for
two
or
three
days
without
being
removed
the
cut
part
should
be
kept
raised
and
cool
when
the
strips
of
plaster
are
to
be
taken
off
they
should
first
be
well
bathed
with
lukewarm
water
this
will
cause
them
to
come
away
easily
and
without
opening
the
lips
of
the
wound
which
accident
is
very
likely
to
take
place
if
they
are
pulled
off
without
having
been
first
moistened
with
the
warm
water
if
the
wound
is
not
healed
when
the
strips
of
plaster
are
taken
off
fresh
ones
must
be
applied
great
care
is
required
in
treating
cuts
of
the
head
as
they
are
often
followed
by
erysipelas
taking
place
round
them
they
should
be
strapped
with
isinglass
plaster
which
is
much
less
irritating
than
the
ordinary
adhesive
plaster
only
use
as
many
strips
as
are
actually
requisite
to
keep
the
two
edges
of
the
wound
together
keep
the
patient
quite
quiet
on
low
diet
for
a
week
or
so
according
to
his
symptoms
purge
him
well
with
the
no
pills
five
grains
of
blue
pill
mixed
with
the
same
quantity
of
compound
extract
of
colocynth
make
into
two
pills
the
dose
for
an
adult
if
the
patient
is
feverish
give
him
two
tablespoonfuls
of
the
three
times
a
day
the
we
remind
our
readers
is
thus
made
mix
a
drachm
of
powdered
nitre
drachms
of
carbonate
of
potash
teaspoonfuls
of
antimonial
wine
and
a
tablespoonful
of
sweet
spirits
of
nitre
in
half
a
pint
of
water
a
person
should
be
very
careful
of
himself
for
a
month
or
two
after
having
had
a
bad
cut
on
the
head
his
bowels
should
be
kept
constantly
open
and
all
excitement
and
excess
avoided
when
a
vein
or
artery
is
wounded
the
danger
is
of
course
much
greater
those
accidents
therefore
should
always
be
attended
to
by
a
surgeon
if
he
can
possibly
be
procured
before
he
arrives
however
or
in
case
his
assistance
can
not
be
obtained
at
all
the
following
treatment
should
be
adopted
raise
the
cut
part
and
press
rags
dipped
in
cold
water
firmly
against
it
this
will
often
be
sufficient
to
stop
the
bleeding
if
the
divided
artery
or
vein
is
not
dangerous
when
an
artery
is
divided
the
blood
is
of
a
bright
red
colour
and
comes
away
in
jets
in
this
case
and
supposing
the
leg
or
arm
to
be
the
cut
part
a
handkerchief
is
to
be
tied
tightly
round
the
limb
the
cut
and
if
possible
the
two
bleeding
ends
of
the
artery
should
each
be
tied
with
a
piece
of
silk
if
the
bleeding
is
from
a
vein
the
blood
is
much
darker
and
does
not
come
away
in
jets
in
this
case
the
handkerchief
is
to
be
tied
the
cut
and
a
pad
of
lint
or
linen
pressed
firmly
against
the
divided
ends
of
the
vein
let
every
bad
cut
especially
where
there
is
much
bleeding
and
even
although
it
may
to
all
appearance
have
been
stopped
be
attended
to
by
a
surgeon
if
one
can
by
any
means
be
obtained
class
or
torn
there
is
not
so
much
bleeding
in
these
cases
as
in
clean
cuts
because
the
are
torn
across
in
a
zigzag
manner
and
not
divided
straight
across
in
other
respects
however
they
are
more
serious
than
ordinary
cuts
being
often
followed
by
inflammation
mortification
fever
and
in
some
cases
by
foreign
substances
are
also

proof
of

was
ignorant

a
defect
in

being
correct
at

there
may
have
been
a

breach
of

may
not

if

the

retaining

he
must

grant
you
a
right

the

the

is
a
not
inconsiderable
array
of
notices
which
are
equally
binding
with
actual
ones
notice
to
your
attorney
or
agent
is
notice
to
you
and
when
the
same
attorney
is
employed
by
both
parties
and
he
is
aware
of
an
encumbrance
of
which
you
are
ignorant
you
are
bound
by
it
even
where
the
vendor
is
guilty
of
a
fraud
to
which
your
agent
is
privy
you
are
responsible
and
can
not
be
released
from
the
consequences
the
relations
of
landlord
and
tenant
are
most
important
to
both
parties
and
each
should
clearly
understand
his
position
the
proprietor
of
a
house
or
house
and
land
agrees
to
let
it
either
to
a
a
yearly
tenancy
or
under
lease
a
may
be
created
by
parol
or
by
agreement
and
as
the
tenant
may
be
turned
out
when
his
landlord
pleases
so
he
may
leave
when
he
himself
thinks
proper
but
this
kind
of
tenancy
is
extremely
inconvenient
to
both
parties
where
an
annual
rent
is
attached
to
the
tenancy
in
construction
of
law
a
lease
or
agreement
without
limitation
to
any
certain
period
is
a
lease
from
year
to
year
and
both
landlord
and
tenant
are
entitled
to
notice
before
the
tenancy
can
be
determined
by
the
other
this
notice
must
be
given
at
least
six
months
before
the
expiration
of
the
current
year
of
the
tenancy
and
it
can
only
terminate
at
the
end
of
any
whole
year
from
the
time
at
which
it
began
so
that
the
tenant
entering
into
possession
at
midsummer
the
notice
must
be
given
to
or
by
him
so
as
to
terminate
at
the
same
term
when
once
he
is
in
possession
he
has
a
right
to
remain
for
a
whole
year
and
if
no
notice
be
given
at
the
end
of
the
first
of
his
tenancy
he
will
have
to
remain
two
years
and
so
on
for
any
number
of
years
tenancy
by
this
is
a
tenancy
not
very
uncommon
arising
out
of
the
unwillingness
of
either
party
to
take
the
initiative
in
a
more
decided
course
at
the
expiry
of
a
lease
or
agreement
the
tenant
remains
in
possession
and
continues
to
pay
rent
as
before
and
becomes
from
sufferance
a
tenant
from
year
to
year
which
can
only
be
terminated
by
one
party
or
the
other
giving
the
necessary
six
notice
to
quit
at
the
term
corresponding
with
the
commencement
of
the
original
tenancy
this
tenancy
at
sufferance
applies
also
to
an
who
remains
in
possession
and
pays
rent
to
the
reversioner
or
head
landlord
a
six
months
notice
will
be
insufficient
for
this
tenancy
a
notice
was
given
in
right
darby
to
quit
a
house
held
by
plaintiff
as
tenant
from
year
to
year
on
the
june
requiring
him
to
quit
the
premises
on
the
october
following
or
such
other
day
as
his
said
tenancy
might
expire
the
tenancy
had
commenced
on
the
october
in
a
former
year
but
it
was
held
that
this
was
not
a
good
notice
for
the
year
ending
october
a
tenant
from
year
to
year
gave
his
landlord
notice
to
quit
ending
the
tenancy
at
a
time
within
the
the
landlord
acquiesced
at
first
but
afterwards
refused
to
accept
the
notice
the
tenant
quitted
the
premises
the
landlord
entered
and
even
made
some
repairs
but
it
was
afterwards
held
that
the
tenancy
was
not
determined
a
notice
to
quit
must
be
such
as
the
tenant
may
safely
act
on
at
the
time
of
receiving
it
therefore
it
can
only
be
given
by
an
agent
properly
authorized
at
the
time
and
can
not
be
made
good
by
the
landlord
adopting
it
afterwards
an
unqualified
notice
given
at
the
proper
time

a
lease
is
an
instrument
in
writing
by
which
one
person
grants
to
another
the
occupation
and
use
of
lands
or
tenements
for
a
term
of
years
for
a
consideration
the
lessor
granting
the

and
the
lessee
accepting
it
with
all
its
conditions
a
lessor
may
grant
the
lease
for
any
term
less
than
his
own
interest
a
tenant
for
life
in
an
estate
can
only
grant
a
lease
for
his
own
life
a
tenant
for
life
having
power
to
grant
a
lease
should
grant
it
only
in
the
terms
of
the
power
otherwise
the
lease
is
void
and
his
estate
may
be
made
to
pay
heavy
penalties
under
the
covenant
usually
the
only
one
onerous
on
the
lessor
for
quiet
enjoyment
the
proprietor
of
a
freehold
that
is
of
the
possession
in
perpetuity
of
lands
or
tenements
may
grant
a
lease
for
years
for
years
or
for
years
in
the
latter
case
the
lease
may
be
either
verbal
or
in
writing
no

form
and
no
stamps
being
necessary
except
the
usual
stamp
on
agreements
so
long
as
the
intention
of
the
parties
is
clearly
expressed
and
the
covenants
definite
and
well
understood
by
each
party
the
agreement
is
complete
and
the
law
satisfied
in
the
case
of
settled
estates
the
court
of
chancery
is
empowered
to
authorize
leases
under
the
vict
and
vict
as
follows
years
for
agriculture
or
occupation
years
for

for
a

may
also
grant
an
for
a
term
less
than
his
own
to
grant
the
whole
of
his
term
would
be
an
assignment
leases
are
frequently
burdened
with
a
covenant
not
to
underlet
without
the
consent
of
the
landlord
this
is
a
covenant
sometimes
very
onerous
and
to
be
avoided
where
it
is
possible
by
a
prudent
lessee
a
lease
for
any
term
beyond
three
years
whether
an
actual
lease
or
an
agreement
for
one
must
be
in
the
form
of
a
deed
that
is
it
must
be
under
seal
and
all
assignments
and
surrenders
of
leases
must
be
in
the
same
form
or
they
are
at
thus
an
agreement
made
by
letter
or
by
a
memorandum
of
agreement
which
would
be
binding
in
most
cases
would
be
valueless
when
it
was
for
a
lease
unless
witnessed
and
given
under
hand
and
seal
the
last
statute
vict
under
which
these
precautions
became
necessary
has
led
to
serious
difficulties
the
judges
says
lord
leonards
feel
the
difficulty
of
holding
a
lease
in
writing
but
not
by
deed
to
be
altogether
void
and
consequently
decided
that
although
such
a
lease
is
void
under
the
statute
yet
it
so
far
regulates
the
holding
that
it
creates
a
tenancy
from
year
to
year
terminable
by
half
a
year
notice
and
if
the
tenure
endure
for
the
term
attempted
to
be
created
by
the
void
lease
the
tenant
may
be
evicted
at
the
end
of
the
term
without
any
notice
to
quit
an
agreement
for
a
lease
not
by
deed
has
been
construed
to
be
a
lease
for
a
term
of
years
and
consequently
void
under
the
statute
and
yet
says
lord
leonards
a
court
of
equity
has
held
that
it
may
be
specifically
enforced
as
an
agreement
upon
the
terms
stated
the
law
on
this
point
is
one
of
glorious
uncertainty
in
making
any
such
agreement
therefore
we
should
be
careful
to
express
that
it
is
an
agreement
and
not
a
lease
and
that
it
is
witnessed
and
under
seal
it
is
usual
where
the
lease
is
a
repairing
one
to
agree
for
a
lease
to
be
granted
on
completion
of
repairs
according
to
specification
this
agreement
should
contain
the
names
and
designation
of
the
parties
a
description
of
the
property
and
the
term
of
the
intended
lease
and
all
the
covenants
which
are
to
be
inserted
as
no
verbal
agreement
can
be
made
to
a
written
agreement
it
should
also
declare
that
the
instrument
is
an
agreement
for
a
lease
and
not
the
lease
itself
the
points
to
be
settled
in
such
an
agreement
are
the
rent
term
and
especially
covenants
for
insuring
and
rebuilding
in
the
event
of
a
fire
and
if
it
is
intended
that
the
lessor
consent
is
to
be
obtained
before
assigning
or
underleasing
a
covenant
to
that
effect
is
required
in
the
agreement
in
usually
granted
for
years
the
tenant
is
to
insure
the
property
and
even
where
the
agreement
is
silent
on
that
point
the
law
decides
it
so
it
is
otherwise
with
ordinary
tenements
when
the
tenant
pays
a
full
or
what
the
law
terms
the
landlord
is
then
to
insure
unless
it
is
otherwise
arranged
by
the
agreement
it
is
important
for
lessee
and
lessor
also
that
the
latter
does
not
exceed
his
powers
a
lease
granted
by
a
tenant
for
life
before
he
is
properly
in
possession
is
void
in
law
for
although
a
court
of
equity
according
to
lord
leonards
will
by
force
of
its
own
jurisdiction
support
a
lease
granted
under
a
power
which
is
merely
erroneous
in
form
or
ceremonies
and
the
vict
and
vict
compel
a
new
lease
to
be
granted
with
the
necessary
variations
while
the
lessor
has
no
power
to
compel
him
to
accept
such
a
lease
except
when
the
person
in
remainder
is
competent
and
willing
to
confirm
the
original
lease
without
variations
yet
all
these
difficulties
involve
both
delay
costs
and
anxieties
in
husbandry
leases
a
covenant
to
cultivate
the
land
in
a
husbandlike
manner
and
according
to
the
custom
of
the
district
is
always
implied
but
it
is
more
usual
to
prescribe
the
course
of
tillage
which
is
to
be
pursued
in
the
case
of
houses
for
occupation
the
tenant
would
have
to
keep
the
house
in
a
tenantable
state
of
repair
during
the
term
and
deliver
it
up
in
like
condition
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
tenant
at
will
or
from
year
to
year
where
the
landlord
has
to
keep
the
house
in
tenantable
repair
and
the
tenant
is
only
liable
for
waste
beyond
reasonable
wear
and
tear
every
lease
or
agreement
for
a
lease
should
covenant
not
only
who
is
to
pay
insurance
but
how
the
tenement
is
to
be
rebuilt
in
the
event
of
a
fire
for
if
the
house
were
burnt
down
and
no
provision
made
for
insurance
the
tenant
supposing
there
was
the
ordinary
covenant
to
repair
in
the
lease
would
not
only
have
to
rebuild
but
to
pay
rent
while
it
was
being
rebuilt
more
than
this
supposing
under
the
same
lease
the
landlord
had
taken
the
precaution
of
insuring
he
is
not
compelled
to
lay
out
the
money
recovered
in
rebuilding
the
premises
sir
john
leach
lays
it
down
that
the
situation
could
not
be
changed
by
a
precaution
on
the
part
of
the
landlord
with
which
he
had
nothing
to
do
this
decision
lord
campbell
confirmed
in
a
more
recent
case
in
which
an
action
was
brought
against
a
lessee
who
was
not
bound
to
repair
and
neither
he
nor
the
landlord
bound
to
insure
admitting
an
equitable
defence
the
court
affirmed
sir
john
leach
decision
holding
that
the
tenant
was
bound
to
pay
the
rent
and
could
not
require
the
landlord
to
lay
out
the
insurance
money
in
rebuilding
this
is
opposed
to
the
opinion
of
lord
leonards
who
admits
however
that
the
decision
of
the
court
must
overrule
his
such
being
the
state
of
the
law
it
is
very
important
that
insurance
should
be
provided
for
and
that
the
payment
of
rent
should
be
made
to
depend
upon
rebuilding
the
house
in
the
event
of
a
fire
care
must
be
taken
however
that
this
is
made
a
covenant
of
the
lease
as
well
as
in
the
agreement
otherwise
the
tenant
must
rebuild
the
house
the
law
declares
that
a
tenant
is
not
bound
to
repair
damages
by
tempest
lightning
or
other
natural
casualty
unless
there
is
a
special
covenant
to
that
effect
in
the
lease
but
if
there
is
a
general
covenant
to
repair
the
repair
will
fall
upon
the
tenant
lord
kenyon
lays
it
down
in
the
case
of
a
bridge
destroyed
by
a
flood
the
tenant
being
under
a
general
covenant
to
repair
that
where
a
party
by
his
own
contract
creates
a
duty
or
charge
upon
himself
he
is
bound
to
make
it
good
because
he
might
have
guarded
against
it
in
the
contract
the
same
principle
of
law
has
been
applied
to
a
house
destroyed
by
lightning
it
is
therefore
important
to
have
this
settled
in
the
insurance
clause
lord
leonards
asserts
that
his
policies
against
fire
are
not
so
framed
as
to
render
the
company
liable
generally
the
property
is
inaccurately
described
with
reference
to
the
conditions
under
which
you
insure
they
are
framed
by
companies
who
probably
are
not
unwilling
to
have
a
legal
defence
against
any
claim
as
they
intend
to
pay
what
they
deem
just
claim
without
taking
advantage
of
any
technical
objection
and
intending
to
make
use
of
their
defence
only
against
what
they
believe
to
be
a
fraud
although
they
may
not
be
able
to
prove
it
but
says
his
lordship
do
not
rely
upon
the
moral
feelings
of
the
directors
ascertain
that
your
house
falls
strictly
within
the
conditions
even
having
the
surveyor
of
the
company
to
look
over
your
house
before
the
insurance
will
not
save
you
unless
your
policy
is
correct
this
is
true
but
probably
his
lordship
legal
jealousy
overshoots
the
mark
here
assurance
companies
only
require
an
honest
statement
of
the
facts
and
that
no
concealment
is
practised
with
their
surveyor
and
the
case
of
his
own
which
he
quotes
in
which
a
glass
door
led
into
a
conservatory
rendering
it
according
to
the
view
of
the
company
hazardous
and
consequently
voiding
the
policy
when
a
fire
did
occur
the
company
paid
rather
than
try
the
question
but
even
after
the
fire
they
demurred
when
called
upon
to
make
the
description
correct
and
indorse
on
the
policy
the
fact
that
the
opened
through
a
glass
door
into
conservatories
one
of
two
inferences
is
obvious
here
either
his
lordship
has
overcoloured
the
statement
or
the
company
could
not
be
the
respectable
one
represented
the
practice
with
all
reputable
offices
is
to
survey
the
premises
before
insurance
and
to
describe
them
as
they
appear
but
no
concealment
of
stoves
or
other
dangerous
accessories
or
inflammable
goods
should
be
practised
this
certainly
binds
the
office
so
long
as
no
change
takes
place
but
the
addition
of
any
stove
opening
or
door
through
a
party
wall
the
introduction
of
gunpowder
saltpetre
or
other
inflammable
articles
into
the
premises
without
notice
very
properly
voids
the
policy
the
usual
course
is
to
give
notice
of
all
alterations
and
have
them
indorse
on
the
policy
as
additions
to
the
description
of
the
property
there
is
little
fear
where
this
is
honestly
done
that
any
company
would
adopt
the
sharp
practice
hinted
at
in
lord
leonards
excellent
handy
book
breaks
in
the
where
a
lease
is
for
seven
fourteen
or
years
the
option
to
determine
it
at
the
end
of
the
first
term
is
in
the
tenant
unless
it
is
distinctly
agreed
that
the
option
shall
be
mutual
according
to
lord
leonards
noxious
a
clause
is
usually
introduced
prohibiting
the
carrying
on
of
any
trade
in
some
houses
and
of
noxious
or
particular
trades
in
others
this
clause
should
be
jealously
inspected
otherwise
great
annoyance
may
be
produced
it
has
been
held
that
a
general
clause
of
this
description
prohibited
a
tenant
from
keeping
a
school
for
which
he
had
taken
it
although
a
lunatic
asylum
and
have
been
found
admissible
the
keeping
an
asylum
not
being
deemed
a
trade
which
is
defined
as
conducted
by
buying
and
selling
it
is
better
to
have
the
trades
or
class
of
trades
objected
to
defined
in
the
lease
in
houses
held
under
lease
it
has
been
the
practice
with
landlords
to
lease
the
bare
walls
of
the
tenement
only
leaving
the
lessee
to
put
in
the
stoves
cupboards
and
such
other
conveniences
as
he
requires
at
his
own
option
those
except
under
particular
circumstances
are
the
property
of
the
lessee
and
may
either
be
sold
to
an
incoming
tenant
or
removed
at
the
end
of
his
term
the
articles
which
may
not
be
removed
are
subject
to
considerable
doubt
and
are
a
fruitful
source
of
dispute
commissioner
fonblanque
has
defined
as
tenants
property
all
goods
and
chattels
all
articles
slightly
connected
one
with
another
and
with
the
freehold
but
capable
of
being
separated
without
materially
injuring
the
freehold
articles
fixed
to
the
freehold
by
nails
and
screws
bolts
or
pegs
are
also
tenants
goods
and
chattels
but
when
sunk
in
the
soil
or
built
on
it
they
are
integral
parts
of
the
freehold
and
can
not
be
removed
thus
a
greenhouse
or
conservatory
attached
to
the
house
by
the
tenant
is
not
removable
but
the
furnace
and
pipes
by
which
it
is
heated
may
be
removed
or
sold
to
the
tenant
a
brick
flue
does
not
come
under
the
same
category
but
remains
grates
stoves
and
in
a
general
sense
everything
he
has
placed
which
can
be
removed
without
injury
to
the
freehold
he
may
remove
if
they
are
separated
from
the
tenement
during
his
term
and
the
place
made
good
it
is
not
unusual
to
leave
the
fixtures
in
their
place
with
an
undertaking
from
the
landlord
that
when
again
let
the
tenant
shall
pay
for
them
or
permit
their
removal
in
a
recent
case
however
a
tenant
having
held
over
beyond
his
term
and
not
removed
his
fixtures
the
landlord
let
the
premises
to
a
new
tenant
who
entered
into
possession
and
would
not
allow
the
fixtures
to
be
removed
it
was
held
by
the
courts
on
trial
that
he
was
justified
a
similar
case
occurred
to
the
writer
he
left
his
fixtures
in
the
house
taking
a
letter
from
the
landlord
undertaking
that
the
tenant
should
pay
for
them
by
valuation
or
permit
their
removal
the
house
was
let
the
landlord
died
his
executors
on
being
applied
to
pleaded
ignorance
as
did
the
tenant
and
on
being
furnished
with
a
copy
of
the
letter
the
executors
told
applicant
that
if
he
was
aggrieved
he
knew
his
remedy
namely
an
action
at
law
he
thought
the
first
loss
the
least
and
has
not
altered
his
opinion
and
are
taxes
but
by
geo
ii
the
occupier
is
required
to
pay
all
rates
levied
and
deduct
from
the
rent
such
taxes
as
belong
to
the
landlord
many
landlords
now
insert
a
covenant
stipulating
that
and
are
to
be
paid
by
the
tenants
and
not
deducted
this
does
not
apply
to
the
all
other
taxes
and
rates
are
payable
by
the
occupier
of
course
is
paid
by
the
tenant
the
as
well
as
have
the
power
of
cutting
off
the
supply
and
most
of
them
have
also
the
right
of
distraining
in
the
same
manner
as
landlords
have
for
rent
notice
to
in
the
case
of
leasing
for
a
term
no
notice
is
necessary
the
tenant
quits
as
a
matter
of
course
at
its
termination
or
if
by
tacit
consent
he
remains
paying
rent
as
heretofore
he
becomes
a
tenant
at
sufferance
or
from
year
to
year
half
a
notice
now
becomes
necessary
as
we
have
already
seen
to
terminate
the
tenancy
except
in
london
and
the
rent
is
under
forty
shillings
when
a
quarter
notice
is
sufficient
either
of
these
notices
may
be
given
verbally
if
it
can
be
proved
that
the
notice
was
definite
and
given
at
the
right
time
form
of
notice
is
quite
immaterial
provided
it
is
definite
and
clear
in
its
purport
tenancy
for
less
than
a
year
may
be
terminated
according
to
the
taking
thus
when
taken
for
three
months
a
three
months
notice
is
required
when
monthly
a
month
notice
and
when
weekly
a
notice
but
weekly
tenancy
is
changed
to
a
quarterly
tenure
if
the
rent
is
allowed
to
stand
over
for
three
months
when
taken
for
a
definite
time
as
a
month
a
week
or
a
quarter
no
notice
is
necessary
on
either
side
at
the
termination
of
a
lease
supposing
he
has
not
done
so
before
a
landlord
can
and
usually
does
send
a
surveyor
to
report
upon
the
condition
of
the
tenement
and
it
becomes
his
duty
to
ferret
out
every
defect
a
litigious
landlord
may
drag
the
outgoing
tenant
into
an
expensive
lawsuit
which
he
has
no
power
to
prevent
he
may
even
compel
him
to
pay
for
repairing
improvements
which
he
has
effected
in
the
tenement
itself
if
dilapidations
exist
when
the
lessor
covenants
to
do
all
repairs
and
fails
to
do
so
the
lessee
may
repair
and
deduct
the
cost
from
the
rent
recovery
of
the
remedies
placed
in
the
hands
of
landlords
are
very
stringent
the
day
after
rent
falls
due
he
may
proceed
to
recover
it
by
action
at
law
by
distress
on
the
premises
or
by
action
of
ejectment
if
the
rent
is
half
a
year
in
arrear
distress
is
the
remedy
usually
applied
the
landlord
being
authorized
to
enter
the
premises
seize
the
goods
and
chattels
of
his
tenant
and
sell
them
on
the
fifth
day
to
reimburse
himself
for
all
arrears
of
rent
and
the
charges
of
the
distress
there
are
a
few
exceptions
but
generally
all
goods
found
on
the
premises
may
be
seized
the
exceptions
are
dogs
rabbits
poultry
fish
tools
and
implements
of
a
man
trade
actually
in
use
the
books
of
a
scholar
the
axe
of
a
carpenter
wearing
apparel
on
the
person
a
horse
at
the
plough
or
a
horse
he
may
be
riding
a
watch
in
the
pocket
loose
money
deeds
writings
the
cattle
at
a
smithy
forge
corn
sent
to
a
mill
for
grinding

and
goods
of
a
guest
at
an
inn
but
curiously
enough
carriages
and
horses
standing
at
livery
at
the
same
inn
may
be
taken
distress
can
only
be
levied
in
the
daytime
and
if
made
after
the
tender
of
arrears
it
is
illegal
if
tender
is
made
after
the
distress
but
before
it
is
the
landlord
must
abandon
the
distress
and
bear
the
cost
himself
nothing
of
a
perishable
nature
which
can
not
be
restored
in
the
same
condition
as
milk
fruit
and
the
like
must
be
taken
the
law
does
not
regard
a
day
as
consisting
of
portions
the
popular
notion
that
a
notice
to
quit
should
be
served
before
noon
is
an
error
although
distraint
is
one
of
the
remedies
it
is
seldom
advisable
in
a
landlord
to
resort
to
distraining
for
the
recovery
of
rent
if
a
tenant
can
not
pay
his
rent
the
sooner
he
leaves
the
premises
the
better
if
he
be
a
rogue
and
wo
pay
he
will
probably
know
that
nine
out
of
ten
distresses
are
illegal
through
the
carelessness
ignorance
or
extortion
of
the
brokers
who
execute
them
many
if
not
most
of
the
respectable
brokers
will
not
execute
distresses
and
the
business
falls
into
the
hands
of
persons
whom
it
is
by
no
means
desirable
to
employ
powers
to
relieve
landlords
of
premises
by
giving
them
legal
possession
are
given
by
cap
to
the
county
courts
in
cases
where
the
rent
does
not
exceed
per
annum
and
under
the
circumstances
hereinafter
mentioned
where
the
term
has
expired
or
been
determined
by
notice
to
quit
where
there
is
one
rent
in
arrear
and
landlord
shall
have
right
by
law
to
enter
for
the
nonpayment
as
proof
of
this
power
is
required
the
importance
of
including
such
a
power
in
the
agreement
for
tenancy
will
be
obvious
in
the
county
courts
the
amount
of
rent
due
may
be
claimed
as
well
as
the
possession
of
the
premises
in
one
summons
when
a
tenant
deserts
premises
leaving
one
rent
in
arrear
possession
may
be
recovered
by
means
of
the
the
rent
must
not
exceed
per
annum
and
must
be
at
least
of
the
value
of
the
premises
in
cases
in
which
the
tenant
has
not
deserted
the
premises
and
where
notice
to
quit
has
been
given
and
has
expired
the
landlord
must
give
notice
to
the
tenant
of
his
intended
application
the
annual
rent
in
this
case
also
must
not
exceed
the
o
the
law
is
not
particular
as
to
orthography
in
fact
it
distinctly
refuses
to
recognize
the
existence
of
that
delightful
science
you
may
bring
your
action
against
jacob
phillips
under
the
fanciful
denomination
of
jaycobb
fillipse
if
you
like
and
the
law
wo
care
because
the
law
goes
by
ear
and
although
it
insists
upon
having
everything
written
things
written
are
only
supposed
in
law
to
have
any
meaning
when
read
which
is
after
all
a
rule
enough
so
instead
of
i
owe
you
persons
of
a
cheerful
disposition
so
frequently
found
connected
with
debt
used
to
write
facetiously
and
the
law
approved
of
their
so
doing
an
is
nothing
more
than
a
written
admission
of
a
debt
and
may
run
thus
october
to
brown
ten
pounds
for
coals
john
jones
if
to
this
you
add
the
time
of
payment
as
payable
in
one
month
from
this
date
your
is
worthless
and
illegal
for
it
thus
ceases
to
be
a
mere
acknowledgment
and
becomes
a
promissory
note
now
a
promissory
note
requires
a
stamp
which
an
does
not
many
persons
nevertheless
stick
penny
stamps
upon
them
probably
for
ornamental
effect
or
to
make
them
look
serious
and
authoritative
if
for
the
former
purpose
the
looks
better
than
the
receipt
stamp
upon
blue
paper
if
you
are
brown
and
you
did
see
the
signed
and
ca
find
anybody
who
knows
jones
autograph
and
jones
wo
pay
the
will
be
of
no
use
to
you
in
the
county
court
except
to
make
the
judge
laugh
he
will
however
allow
you
to
prove
the
consideration
and
as
of
course
you
wo
be
prepared
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
he
will
if
you
ask
him
politely
adjourn
the
hearing
for
a
week
when
you
can
produce
the
coalheavers
who
delivered
the
article
and
thus
gain
a
glorious
victory
by
the
statute
eliz
cap
it
is
enacted
that
in
cases
of
by
masters
towards
apprentices
or
of
neglect
of
duty
by
apprentices
the
complaining
party
may
apply
to
a
justice
of
the
peace
who
may
make
such
order
as
equity
may
require
if
for
want
of
conformity
on
the
part
of
the
master
this
can
not
be
done
then
the
master
may
be
bound
to
appear
at
the
next
sessions
authority
is
given
by
the
act
to
the
justices
in
sessions
to
discharge
the
apprentice
from
his
indentures
they
are
also
empowered
on
proof
of
misbehaviour
of
the
apprentice
to
order
him
to
be
corrected
or
imprisoned
with
hard
labour
husband
and
contrary
to
the
vulgar
opinion
second
cousins
as
well
as
first
may
legally
marry
when
married
a
husband
is
liable
for
his
wife
debts
contracted
before
marriage
a
creditor
desirous
of
suing
for
such
a
claim
should
proceed
against
both
it
will
however
be
sufficient
if
the
husband
be
served
with
process
the
names
of
both
appearing
therein
thus
john
jones
and
ann
his
wife
a
married
woman
if
sued
alone
may
plead
her
marriage
or
as
it
is
called
in
law
coverture
the
husband
is
liable
for
debts
of
his
wife
contracted
for
necessaries
while
living
with
him
if
she
voluntarily
leaves
his
protection
this
liability
ceases
he
is
also
liable
for
any
debts
contracted
by
her
with
his
authority
if
the
husband
have
abjured
the
realm
or
been
transported
by
a
sentence
of
law
the
wife
is
liable
during
his
absence
as
if
she
were
a
single
woman
for
debts
contracted
by
her
in
civil
cases
a
wife
may
now
give
evidence
on
behalf
of
her
husband
in
criminal
cases
she
can
neither
be
a
witness
for
or
against
her
husband
the
case
of
assault
by
him
upon
her
forms
an
exception
to
this
rule
the
law
does
not
at
this
day
admit
the
ancient
principle
of
allowing
moderate
correction
by
a
husband
upon
the
person
of
his
wife
although
this
is
said
to
have
been
anciently
limited
to
the
use
of
a
stick
not
bigger
than
the
thumb
this
barbarity
is
now
altogether
exploded
he
may
notwithstanding
as
has
been
recently
shown
in
the
famous
agapemone
case
keep
her
under
restraint
to
prevent
her
leaving
him
provided
this
be
effected
without
cruelty
by
the
divorce
and
matrimonial
causes
act
a
wife
deserted
by
her
husband
may
apply
to
a
magistrate
or
to
the
petty
sessions
for
an
order
to
protect
her
lawful
earnings
or
property
acquired
by
her
after
such
desertion
from
her
husband
and
his
creditors
in
this
case
it
is
indispensable
that
such
order
shall
within
ten
days
be
entered
at
the
county
court
of
the
district
within
which
she
resides
it
will
be
seen
that
the
basis
of
an
application
for
such
an
order
is
consequently
where
the
parties
have
separated
by
common
consent
such
an
order
can
not
be
obtained
any
previous
cruelty
or
misconduct
on
the
husband
part
notwithstanding
when
a
husband
allows
his
wife
to
invest
money
in
her
own
name
in
a
and
he
survives
her
it
is
sometimes
the
rule
of
such
establishments
to
compel
him
to
take
out
administration
in
order
to
receive
such
money
although
it
is
questionable
whether
such
rule
is
legally
justifiable
widows
and
widowers
pay
no
for
property
coming
to
them
through
their
deceased
partners
receipts
for
sums
above
should
now
be
given
upon
penny
stamps
a
bill
of
exchange
may
nevertheless
be
discharged
by
an
indorsement
stating
that
it
has
been
paid
and
this
will
not
be
liable
to
the
stamp
a
receipt
is
not
as
commonly
supposed
conclusive
evidence
as
to
a
payment
it
is
only
what
the
law
terms
evidence
that
is
good
until
contradicted
or
explained
thus
if
a
sends
wares
or
merchandise
to
b
with
a
receipt
as
a
hint
that
the
transaction
is
intended
to
be
for
ready
money
and
b
detain
the
receipt
without
paying
the
cash
a
will
be
at
liberty
to
prove
the
circumstances
and
to
recover
his
claim
the
evidence
to
rebut
the
receipt
must
however
be
clear
and
indubitable
as
after
all
written
evidence
is
of
a
stronger
nature
than
oral
testimony
books
of
a
tradesman
books
of
account
can
not
be
received
as
evidence
in
his
own
behalf
unless
the
entries
therein
be
proved
to
have
been
brought
under
the
notice
of
and
admitted
to
be
correct
by
the
other
party
as
is
commonly
the
case
with
the
employed
backwards
and
forwards
between
bakers
butchers
and
the
like
domestic
traders
and
their
customers
the
defendant
may
however
compel
the
tradesman
to
produce
his
books
to
show
entries
adverse
to
his
own
claim
the
last
proof
of
affection
which
we
can
give
to
those
left
behind
is
to
leave
their
worldly
affairs
in
such
a
state
as
to
excite
neither
jealousy
nor
anger
nor
heartrendings
of
any
kind
at
least
for
the
immediate
future
this
can
only
be
done
by
a
just
clear
and
intelligible
disposal
of
whatever
there
is
to
leave
without
being
advocates
for
every
man
being
his
own
lawyer
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
the
most
elaborately
prepared
wills
have
been
the
most
fruitful
sources
of
litigation
and
it
has
even
happened
that
learned
judges
left
wills
behind
them
which
could
not
be
carried
out
except
in
cases
where
the
property
is
in
land
or
in
leases
of
complicated
tenure
very
elaborate
details
are
unnecessary
and
we
counsel
no
man
to
use
words
in
making
his
will
of
which
he
does
not
perfectly
understand
the
meaning
and
import
all
men
over
years
of
age
and
of
sound
mind
and
all
unmarried
women
of
like
age
and
sanity
may
by
will
bequeath
their
property
to
whom
they
please
infants
that
is
all
persons
under
years
of
age
and
married
women
except
where
they
have
an
estate
to
their
own
separate
use
are
incapacitated
without
the
concurrence
of
the
husband
the
law
taking
the
disposal
of
any
property
they
die
possessed
of
a
person
born
deaf
and
dumb
can
not
make
a
will
unless
there
is
evidence
that
he
could
read
and
comprehend
its
contents
a
person
convicted
of
felony
can
not
make
a
will
unless
subsequently
pardoned
neither
can
persons
outlawed
but
the
wife
of
a
felon
transported
for
life
may
make
a
will
and
act
in
all
respects
as
if
she
were
unmarried
a
suicide
may
bequeath
real
estate
but
personal
property
is
forfeited
to
the
crown
except
in
the
case
of
soldiers
on
actual
service
and
sailors
at
sea
every
will
must
be
made
in
writing
it
must
be
signed
by
the
testator
or
by
some
other
person
in
his
presence
and
at
his
request
and
the
signature
must
be
made
or
acknowledged
in
the
presence
of
two
or
more
witnesses
who
are
required
to
be
present
at
the
same
time
who
declare
by
signing
that
the
will
was
signed
by
the
testator
or
acknowledged
in
their
presence
and
that
they
signed
as
witnesses
in
testator
presence
by
the
act
of
it
was
enacted
that
no
will
shall
be
valid
unless
signed
at
the
foot
or
end
thereof
by
the
testator
or
by
some
person
in
his
presence
and
by
his
direction
but
a
subsequent
act
proceeds
to
say
that
every
will
shall
as
far
only
as
regards
the
position
of
the
signature
of
the
testator
or
of
the
person
signing
for
him
be
deemed
valid
if
the
signature
shall
be
so
placed
at
or
after
or
following
or
under
or
beside
or
opposite
to
the
end
of
the
will
that
it
shall
be
apparent
on
the
face
of
it
that
the
testator
intended
to
give
it
effect
by
such
signature
under
this
clause
a
will
of
several
sheets
all
of
which
were
duly
signed
except
the
last
one
has
been
refused
probate
while
on
the
other
hand
a
similar
document
has
been
admitted
to
probate
where
the
last
sheet
only
and
none
of
the
other
sheets
was
signed
in
order
to
be
perfectly
formal
however
each
separate
sheet
should
be
numbered
signed
and
witnessed
and
attested
on
the
last
sheet
this
witnessing
is
an
important
act
the
witnesses
must
subscribe
it
in
the
presence
of
the
testator
and
of
each
other
and
by
their
signature
they
testify
to
having
witnessed
the
signature
of
the
testator
he
being
in
sound
mind
at
the
time
wills
made
under
any
kind
of
coercion
or
even
importunity
may
become
void
being
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
testator
fraud
or
imposition
also
renders
a
will
void
and
where
two
wills
made
by
the
same
person
happen
to
exist
neither
of
them
dated
the
maker
of
the
wills
is
declared
to
have
died
intestate
a
will
may
always
be
revoked
and
annulled
but
only
by
burning
or
entirely
destroying
the
writing
or
by
adding
a
codicil
or
making
a
subsequent
will
duly
attested
but
as
the
alteration
of
a
will
is
only
a
revocation
to
the
extent
of
the
alteration
if
it
is
intended
to
revoke
the
original
will
entirely
such
intention
should
be
declared
no
merely
verbal
directions
can
revoke
a
written
will
and
the
act
of
running
the
pen
through
the
signatures
or
down
the
page
is
not
sufficient
to
cancel
it
without
a
written
declaration
to
that
effect
signed
and
witnessed
a
will
made
before
marriage
is
revoked
thereby
a
codicil
is
a
supplement
or
addition
to
a
will
either
explaining
or
altering
former
dispositions
it
may
be
written
on
the
same
or
separate
paper
and
is
to
be
witnessed
and
attested
in
the
same
manner
as
the
original
document
any
persons
are
qualified
to
witness
a
will
who
can
write
their
names
but
such
witness
can
not
be
benefitted
by
the
will
if
a
legacy
is
granted
to
the
persons
witnessing
it
is
void
the
same
rule
applies
to
the
husband
or
wife
of
a
witness
a
bequest
made
to
either
of
these
is
void
form
of
form
is
unimportant
provided
the
intention
is
clear
it
should
commence
with
his
designation
that
is
his
name
and
surname
place
of
abode
profession
or
occupation
the
legatees
should
also
be
clearly
described
in
leaving
a
legacy
to
a
married
woman
if
no
trustees
are
appointed
over
it
and
no
specific
directions
given
that
it
is
for
her
sole

the
husband
will
be
entitled
to
the
legacy
in
the
same
manner
a
legacy
to
an
unmarried
woman
will
vest
in
her
husband
after
marriage
unless
a
settlement
of
it
is
made
on
her
before
marriage
in
sudden
emergencies
a
form
may
be
useful
and
the
following
has
been
considered
a
good
one
for
a
will
where
the
assistance
of
a
solicitor
could
not
be
obtained
indeed
few
solicitors
can
prepare
a
will
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
they
require
time
and
legal
forms
which
are
by
no
means
necessary
before
they
can
act
i
of
no
street
in
the
city
of
gentleman
builder
or
grocer
as
the
case
may
be
being
of
sound
mind

and

not
a
compliance

act
he
must
sign
first
in
the
case
of
persons
dying
intestate
when
their
effects
are
administered
to
by
their
family
the
is
half
as
much
more
as
it
would
have
been
under
a
will
freehold
and

now
subject
to
a
special
impost
on
passing

when
it
amounts
to
and
upwards
and
where
it
is
not
directed
otherwise
the
duty
is
deducted
from
the
legacy
you
can
not
compound
for
past
absence
of
charity
by
bequeathing
land
or
tenements
or
money
to
purchase
such
to
any
charitable
use
by
your
last
will
and
testament
but
you
may
devise
them
to
the
british
museum
to
either
of
the
two
universities
of
oxford
and
cambridge
to
eton
winchester
and
westminster
and
you
may
if
so
inclined
leave
it
for
the
augmentation
of
queen
anne
bounty
you
may
however
order
your
executors
to
sell
land
and
hand
over
the
money
received
to
any
charitable
institution
in
making
provision
for
a
wife
state
whether
it
is
in
lieu
of
or
in

you
have
advanced
money
to
any
child
and
taken
an
acknowledgment
for
it
or
entered
it
in
any
book
of
account
you
should
declare
whether
any
legacy
left
by
will
is
in
addition
to
such
advance
or
whether
it
is
to
be
deducted
from
the
legacy
a
legacy
left
by
will
to
any
one
would
be
cancelled
by
your
leaving
another
legacy
by
a
codicil
to
the
same
person
unless
it
is
stated
to
be
in
addition
to
the
former
bequest
your
entire
estate
is
chargeable
with
your
debts
except
where
the
real
estate
is
settled
let
it
be
distinctly
stated
out
of
which
property
the
real
or
personal
they
are
paid
where
it
consists
of
both
whatever
is
let
the
intention
be
clearly
expressed
and
without
any
condition
if
you
intend
it
to
take
effect
attestation
is
not
necessary
to
a
will
as
the
act
of
witnessing
is
all
the
law
requires
and
the
will
itself
declares
the
testator
to
be
of
sound
mind
in
his
own
estimation
but
wherever
there
are
erasures
or
interlineations
one
becomes
necessary
no
particular
form
is
prescribed
but
it
should
state
that
the
testator
either
signed
it
himself
or
that
another
signed
it
by
his
request
or
that
he
acknowledged
the
signature
to
be
his
in
their
presence
both
being
present
together
and
signed
as
witnesses
in
his
presence
when
there
are
erasures
the
attestation
must
declare
that
the
words
interlined
in
the
third
line
of
page
and
the
erasure
in
the
fifth
line
of
page
having
been
first
made
these
are
the
acts
necessary
to
make
a
properly
executed
will
and
being
simple
in
themselves
and
easily
performed
they
should
be
strictly
complied
with
and
always
attested
a
witness
may
on
being
requested
sign
for
testator
and
he
may
also
sign
for
his
supposing
he
can
only
make
his
mark
declaring
that
he
does
so
but
a
husband
can
not
sign
for
his
wife
either
as
testator
or
witness
nor
can
a
wife
for
her
husband
