introduction
the
decade
of
the
nineties
in
league
history
bids
fair
to
surpass
in
exciting
events
that
of
every
preceding
series
of
years
known
in
the
annals
of
professional
base
ball
the
decade
in
question
began
with
the
players
revolt
in
and
was
followed
up
by
the
secession
of
the
old
american
association
a
fatal
movement
which
ended
in
the
death
of
that
organization
in
the
winter
of
the
reorganization
of
the
national
league
resulting
in
the
absorption
of
the
best
half
of
the
old
association
clubs
and
the
beginning
of
the
experiment
of
governing
the
whole
professional
fraternity
by
one
instead
of
by
a
dual
government
as
before
this
one
powerful
league
being
itself
controlled
by
the
laws
of
the
the
cost
of
the
amalgamation
of
the
four
american
association
clubs
with
the
national
league
together
with
the
financial
losses
incurred
by
the
revolutionary
period
of
and
losses
by
the
way
which
the
players
did
not
participate
in
the
clubs
alone
being
the
sufferers
left
a
heavy
burden
of
debt
to
handicap
the
reconstructed
national
league
in
its
efforts
to
recover
the
public
confidence
in
professional
ball
playing
lost
by
the
malcontents
of
and
but
nevertheless
the
seasons
of
and
saw
the
heavy
indebtedness
removed
from
the
league
shoulders
and
in
the
flourishing
financial
times
of
and
were
in
a
measure
renewed
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
brotherhood
revolt
of
the
professional
base
ball
business
in
became
a
paying
investment
it
will
scarcely
be
believed
that
in
the
face
of
the
financial
losses
incurred
during
the
revolutionary
period
of
and
that
the
closing
part
of
the
season
of
saw
another
attempt
made
to
renew
the
troubles
of
by
an
effort
made
to
resuscitate
the
defunct
american
association
under
the
banner
of
to
the
league
reserve
together
with
that
of
a
joint
attempt
made
to
revive
the
old
brotherhood
plan
of
rival
league
clubs
in
the
larger
base
ball
cities
of
the
union
this
revolutionary
effort
made
by
one
of
the
promoters
of
the
revolt
of
aided
by
two
dismissed
managers
and
a
disgruntled
star
player
itching
for
notoriety
at
any
cost
led
the
magnates
of
the
national
league
to
adopt
repressive
measures
calculated
to
put
an
end
to
any
future
revolutionary
efforts
of
the
kind
by
severely
punishing
any
league
club
manager
or
player
who
should
prove
recreant
in
fealty
to
the
laws
of
the
national
agreement
or
who
should
join
in
any
attempt
to
organize
any
base
ball
association
opposed
to
the
reserve
rule
which
rule
over
ten
years
experience
had
proved
to
be
the
fundamental
law
and
of
the
professional
base
ball
business
without
such
a
repressive
law
it
was
evident
that
the
league
would
be
subject
to
periodical
attempts
on
the
part
of
unscrupulous
managers
or
players
to
war
upon
the
reserve
rule
for
blackmail
purposes
the
necessity
for
some
such
law
was
made
evident
by
the
recent
efforts
made
to
organize
a
new
american
association
on
the
basis
of
not
only
warring
upon
the
reserve
rule
but
of
trespassing
on
the
territorial
rights
of
existing
league
clubs
the
league
manifesto
of
the
finale
to
the
annual
meeting
of
was
the
issuing
of
a
manifesto
by
the
national
league
which
was
called
forth
by
an
effort
at
treachery
in
the
league
ranks
which
required
prompt
action
for
its
repression
this
manifesto
was
issued
without
regard
to
efforts
to
organize
a
new
american
association
any
opposition
of
the
kind
to
the
national
agreement
clubs
with
the
major
league
at
its
head
being
looked
upon
as
futile
owing
to
the
character
of
the
men
alleged
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
movement
the
main
incentive
of
the
league
magnates
being
to
publicly
announce
what
the
penalty
of
treachery
to
national
agreement
interests
would
be
in
the
future
the
manifesto
in
question
was
the
work
of
a
special
committee
appointed
by
the
national
league
at
its
annual
meeting
in
november
which
consisted
of
chas
byrne
r
von
der
horst
james
hart
and
john
brush
the
following
is
the
statement
drawn
up
by
the
committee
and
referred
to
the
national
board
for
adoption
to
the
national
board
of
professional
base
ball
associations
from
the
year
when
base
ball
was
established
in
this
country
on
a
substantial
and
responsible
basis
by
the
disbandment
of
the
national
association
of
professional
base
ball
clubs
and
the
organization
of
the
national
league
of
professional
base
ball
clubs
down
to
the
present
time
the
duty
has
been
imposed
upon
some
body
or
organization
to
uphold
and
enforce
the
objects
for
which
base
ball
was
established
to
wit
first
to
perpetuate
base
ball
as
the
national
game
of
the
united
states
and
to
surround
it
with
such
safeguards
as
to
warrant
for
the
future
absolute
public
confidence
in
its
integrity
and
methods
second
to
protect
and
promote
the
mutual
interests
of
professional
base
ball
clubs
and
professional
base
ball
players
the
national
league
formed
in
found
a
difficult
task
before
it
in
undertaking
to
carry
out
the
objects
above
referred
to
interest
in
base
ball
was
at
a
low
ebb
gamblers
were
in
possession
the
game
was
without
discipline
organization
or
legitimate
control
the
sport
was
conducted
with
dishonest
methods
and
for
dishonest
purposes
and
had
neither
the
respect
nor
confidence
of
the
press
or
public
heroic
methods
were
absolutely
necessary
at
a
meeting
of
the
national
league
held
in
cleveland
december
the
league
directors
unanimously
ratified
the
action
of
the
louisville
club
in
expelling
from
the
professional
ranks
james
devlin
craver
nichols
and
hall
for
conduct
in
contravention
to
the
object
of
the
league
these
men
had
been
charged
with
and
convicted
of
willfully
selling
a
game
of
base
ball
at
first
the
action
of
the
league
in
taking
such
an
extreme
course
was
strongly
denounced
the
league
however
foresaw
that
any
condonation
of
fraud
or
crookedness
meant
death
to
the
national
game
and
remained
firm
in
its
position
public
opinion
soon
turned
and
it
is
universally
conceded
that
the
course
then
taken
did
more
to
establish
the
honesty
and
integrity
of
base
ball
than
any
action
taken
or
legislation
since
enacted
from
that
day
to
this
no
charge
of
crookedness
or
dishonesty
has
been
made
against
a
professional
ball
player
repeated
attempts
have
been
made
to
reinstate
these
men
or
those
of
them
now
living
but
their
expulsion
was
final
and
irrevocable
that
the
league
was
earnest
in
its
efforts
to
purify
the
game
was
further
demonstrated
by
its
action
taken
at
a
special
meeting
held
at
the
russell
house
detroit
on
june
when
richard
higham
a
league
umpire
was
upon
charges
preferred
by
the
detroit
club
expelled
for
crooked
work
as
an
umpire
from
that
day
to
this
no
such
charge
has
ever
been
made
against
an
official
umpire
the
rapid
increase
in
the
compensation
of
ball
players
soon
opened
up
another
avenue
of
trouble
for
the
league
which
needed
and
received
prompt
attention
this
was
flagrant
and
open
dissipation
in
the
ranks
at
home
and
abroad
while
this
was
confined
comparatively
to
a
few
men
the
innocent
suffered
largely
from
it
and
the
national
league
was
brought
into
disrepute
heroic
measures
were
again
adopted
and
several
players
were
indefinitely
suspended
with
excellent
effect
it
is
safe
to
say
that
there
is
less
dissipation
and
drunkenness
in
the
ranks
of
professional
ball
players
in
proportion
to
their
number
than
in
any
other
organized
or
unorganized
body
in
this
country
identified
with
outdoor
sports
the
success
achieved
by
the
national
league
in
its
efforts
to
develop
base
ball
as
the
national
game
became
apparent
in
its
rapid
growth
in
popular
favor
and
the
establishment
of
clubs
and
associations
throughout
the
various
states
it
became
evident
soon
that
something
must
be
done
to
foster
and
protect
the
rights
and
interests
of
these
various
bodies
and
that
there
was
a
recognized
need
of
some
central
power
in
base
ball
to
govern
all
associations
by
an
equitable
code
of
general
laws
to
put
the
game
on
a
prosperous
and
lasting
basis
to
accomplish
this
purpose
a
meeting
was
held
in
the
fifth
avenue
hotel
new
york
february
at
which
delegates
were
present
representing
the
national
league
the
american
association
and
the
northwestern
league
at
that
meeting
the
tripartite
agreement
was
drawn
up
and
agreed
to
which
substantially
was
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
embodying
a
mutual
respect
of
all
contracts
and
other
obligations
and
all
rights
of
the
parties
to
the
agreement
to
territorial
rights
players
under
contract
or
held
under
reserve
the
adoption
of
the
tripartite
agreement
opened
a
new
era
in
base
ball
and
it
was
so
readily
recognized
as
being
a
step
in
the
line
of
progress
that
when
the
committee
which
drew
up
the
agreement
was
called
together
in
new
york
city
in
october
they
decided
to
call
the
instrument
they
had
framed
the
national
agreement
of
professional
base
ball
clubs
the
purpose
being
to
open
the
door
to
all
clubs
leagues
and
associations
desiring
to
live
under
the
conditions
rules
and
regulations
of
the
agreement
immediately
several
leagues
and
associations
applied
for
the
protection
assured
the
and
readily
pledged
themselves
to
abide
by
the
requirements
designated
in
the
agreement
the
action
of
the
committee
in
framing
the
new
national
agreement
was
subsequently
ratified
by
the
signatures
of
the
presidents
of
the
parties
thereto
viz
the
national
league
of
professional
base
ball
clubs
mills

william
sedden
president
february
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
national
agreement
as
originally
drawn
and
which
is
now
in
operation
is
a
respect
for
territorial
rights
this
in
fact
is
the
corner
stone
of
the
structure
it
contemplates
and
provides
for
the
organization
of
cities
into
leagues
or
associations
with
one
club
and
one
only
in
each
city
and
a
contest
between
the
respective
cities
for
championship
honors
the
interest
which
base
ball
arouses
in
any
city
is
based
absolutely
on
local
pride
the
essence
of
value
to
a
championship
is
entirely
to
the
city
to
which
the
victorious
club
belongs
experience
has
demonstrated
that
whenever
and
wherever
territorial
rights
have
been
invaded
and
rival
clubs
established
the
element
of
local
pride
is
absent
and
interest
in
both
destroyed
it
is
this
which
makes
a
respect
for
territorial

at
times
have
presented
themselves
and
which
have
been
by
severe
but
just
methods
removed
the
future
of
base

is
confronted
by
a
new
condition
a
condition
which
in
every
particular
is
as
harmful
and
in
many
respects
far
more
dangerous
than
open
dishonesty
or
flagrant
dissipation
that
is
treachery
within
the
lines
and
for
months
past
we
have
had
men
identified
with
professional
base
ball
who
for
years
have
been
the
beneficiaries
of
the
game
have
received
liberal
compensation
for
the
work
they
have
done
earned
their
livelihood
entirely
and
absolutely
from
the
opportunities
afforded
them
by
clubs
and
organizations
operating
under
the
national
agreement
and
we
find
and
now
know
that
these
men
during
this
time
have
persistently
been
identifying
themselves
with
schemes
and
combinations
the
objects
and
sole
purposes
of
which
are
to
weaken
and
perhaps
destroy
the
splendid
fabric
of
our
national

which
it
has
taken
years
of
effort
anxiety
and
large
outlay
of
capital
to
construct

the
confidence
of
the

the
press
of
the

in
the
methods

the
integrity
of

in
larger
measure

in

it

been
made
known

we
have
good
and
substantial
reasons
for
believing
that
such

is
correct
that
a

is
contemplated
which
of
necessity
must
operate
without

appears
also
that
it
is
the
purpose
of
the

if
it
materializes

the
base
ball
season
of
to
professional
base
ball
as
governed
by
the
existing

is
mainly
due
the
great
popularity
our
national
game
has
achieved
within
the
past
twenty
years
of
course
the
amateur
class
of
the
fraternity
greatly
outnumber
the
professionals
but
the
game
could
never
have
reached
its
present
point
of
excellence
in
field
work
but
for
the
time
and
attention
the
professional
clubs
were
enabled
to
devote
to
its
thorough
development
from
the
year
of
harry

famous
red
stocking
nine
of
cincinnati
in
to
the
existing
period
of
model
professional
ball
playing
in

the
amateur

could
never
have
given
the
game
the
time
and
labor
required
for
its
evolution
which
the
professional
clubs
were
enabled
to
do
and
moreover
not
one

in

thousand
could
have
spared
the
money

fit
up

in
serviceable

such
finely
equipped
ball
grounds
as
those
now
owned
by
the
leading
professional
clubs
of
the
national

to
these
facts
too
are
to
be
added
the
statement
that
to
the
national
league
government
of
the
professional
class
of
the
fraternity
is
due
the
lasting
credit
of
sustaining
the
integrity
of
play
in
the
game
up
to
the
highest
standard
so
much
so
indeed
that
it
has
reached
the
point
of
surpassing
in
this
most
important
respect
every
other
sport
in
vogue
in
which
professional
exemplars
are
employed
take
it
for
all
in
all
no
season
since
the
inauguration
of
the

in
has
approached
that
of
in
the
number
of
clubs
which
took
part
in
the
season
games
both
in
the
amateur
as
well
as
the
professional
arena
and
certainly
no
previous
season
ever
saw
the
professional
clubs
of
the
country
so
well
patronized
as
they
were
in
moreover
it
was
the
most
brilliant
and
successful
season
in
every
respect
known
in
the
annals
of
the
college
clubs
of
the
country
in
fact
there
was
but
one
drawback
to
the
creditable
success
of
the
entire
championship
campaigns
of
and
that
was
the
unwonted
degree
of
hoodlumism
which
disgraced
the
season
in
the
professional
arena
and
this
we
regret
to
say
was
painfully
conspicuous
among
the
players
of
the
national
league
clubs
this
organization
having
been
noted
prior
to
its
absorption
of
the
old
american
association
element
in
its
ranks
in
for
the
reputable
character
of
its
annual
struggles
for
championship
honors
one
result
of
the
rowdy
ball
playing
indulged
in
by
a
minority
of
each
club
team
in
the
league
was
a
decided
falling
off
in
the
attendance
of
the
best
class
of
patrons
of
the
professional
clubs
much
of
the
a
technical
term
applicable
to
the
use
of
language
low
cunning
unworthy
of
manly
players
on
umpire
and
players
that
nuisance
of
our
ball
fields
kicking
and
the
dishonorable
methods
comprised
in
the
term
ball
in
in
was
largely
due
to
the
advocacy
of
the
method
of
the
which
countenanced
rowdy
ball
playing
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
work
in
winning
games
the
most
energetic
lively
and
exciting
method
of
playing
a
game
of
ball
can
mark
a
professional
club
contest
without
its
being
disgraced
by
a
single
act
of
rowdyism
such
as
that
of
spiking
or
willfully
colliding
with
a
base
runner
bellowing
like
a
wild
bull
at
the
pitcher
as
in
the
coaching
of
and
or
that
of
kicking
against
the
decisions
of
the
umpire
to
hide
faulty
captaincy
or
blundering
fielding
nothing
of
this
hoodlumism
marked
the
play
of
the
winners
of
the
league
pennant
from
to
inclusive
the
old
gentlemanly
boston
red
stockings
of
the
early
seventies
under
the
leadership
of
that
most
competent
of
all
managers
harry
wright
yet
despite
of
this
old
time
fact
if
club
managers
do
not
adopt
the
rough
method
of
playing
the
game
as
illustrated
in
the
league
arena
in
advocated
by
the
class
of
newspaper
managers
of
local
clubs
the
scribes
in
question
go
for
the
local
team
officials
for
not
having
a
team
with
plenty
of
ginger
in
their
work
and
for
their
not
being
governed
by
a
hustling
manager
is
it
any
wonder
under
such
circumstances
that
the
league
season
of
was
characterized
by
hoodlumism
but
little
advance
was
made
in
the
way
of
effective
team
management
in
the
league
in
about
a
third
of
the
twelve
teams
of
the
league
only
were
controlled
by
competent
team
managers
while
at
least
another
third
were
wretchedly
managed
and
the
other
third
were
not
above
the
average
in
management
two
of
the
old
drawbacks
to
the
successful
running
of
teams
by
professional
clubs
conspicuous
in
and
marked
the
team
management
of
the
employment
of
drinking
players
and
the
condoning
of
their
costly
offenses
and
the
interference
of
club
presidents
and
directors
in
the
work
of
the
regular
manager
of
the
club
team
there
is
a
class
of
club
officials
in
the
league
who
for
the
life
of
them
can
not
keep
from
interfering
with
the
club
legitimate
manager
in
his
running
of
the
team
some
of
them
have
the
cool
effrontery
of
stating
that
the
manager
of
our
team
is
never
interfered
with
in
any
way
one
costly
result
of
this
club
official
interference
is
that
needed
discipline
of
the
players
is
out
of
the
question
and
in
its
absence
cliqueism
in
the
ranks
of
the
team
sets
in
one
set
of
players
siding
with
the
manager
and
another
with
the
real
boss
of
the
team
with
the
costly
penalty
of
discord
in
the
ranks
it
is
all
nonsense
for
a
club
to
place
a
manager
in
the
position
with
a
merely
nominal
control
of
the
players
and
then
to
hold
him
responsible
for
the
of
the
team
in
winning
games
under
such
a
condition
of
things
the
club
manager
might
sign
a
team
of
costly
star
players
and
yet
find
himself
surpassed
in
the
pennant
race
by
a
rival
manager
who
with
control
of
his
and
that
team
composed
of
players
or
ambitious
colts
working
in
thorough
harmony
together
and
playing
for
the
side
all
the
time
and
not
for
a
record
as
so
many
of
the
star
players
do
would
deservedly
carry
off
the
season
honors
since
the
reconstructed
national
league
began
its
new
life
blundering
management
of
teams
has
characterized
the
running
of
a
majority
of
its
twelve
clubs
and
it
will
continue
to
do
so
while
the
system
of
engaging
players
for
their
records
merely
and
not
for
their
ability
in
doing
team
work
and
in
playing
harmoniously
together
is
continued
especially
too
is
the
plan
of
engaging
players
whose
daily
habits
of
life
are
at
war
with
their
ability
to
do
work
in
the
field
year
after
year
are
drinking
offenses
condoned
by
the
club
officials
who
run
the
club
and
old
time
drunkards
for
the
coming
season
while
steady
sober
players
are
left
out
in
the
cold
besides
this
blunder
there
is
that
of
engaging
half
worn
out
stars
in
the
place
of
rising
young
players
ambitious
of
distinguishing
themselves
in
the
league
arena
this
mistake
in
team
management
was
as
conspicuous
in
as
it
was
in
a
feature
of
the
professional
base
ball
season
of
was
the
almost
phenomenal
success
of
the
clubs
alike
of
the
minor
leagues
as
of
the
great
major

itself
in
battling
against
the
serious
drawback
of
the
hard
times
of
the
year
which
prevailed
throughout
the
entire
season
experience
shows
that
in
the
sports
in
vogue
which
have
innate
attractions
for
public
patronage
in
times
of
great
financial
difficulties
in
the
commercial
centres
of
the
union
the
national
game
stands
conspicuous
and
the
past
season
in
this
respect
presented
a
most
notable
record
no
such
crowds
of
spectators
ever
having
been
seen
at
the
leading
contests
of
the
season
as
in
another
feature
of
the
past
season
was
the
interest
taken
in
the
college
club
contests
of
the
spring
and
early
summer
campaign
the
leading
club
teams
giving
a
superior
exhibition
of

work

to
that
of
in

flourished
as
a
whole
throughout
the
entire

in
as
it
never
had
done
before
in
the
history
of
the
game
the
league
championship
campaign
of
the
struggle
for
the
league
championship
pennant
in
was
the
most
noteworthy
one
on
record
in
one
particular
respect
and
that
was
in
the
exciting
struggle
by
the
three
leaders
of

first
division
for
the
championship
which
struggle
began
on

with

became
one
of
the
trio
on
july
after
which
date
these
three
clubs
occupied
the
position
of
first
three
in
the
race
to
the
finish
the
other
nine
clubs
not
being
in
it
after
july
in
all
other
respects
the
race
for
the
pennant
of
was
far
from
being
up
to
the
standard
that
should
characterize
the
league
championship
season
no
less
than
three
of
the
minor
league
pennant
races
being
more
evenly
contested
than
was
that
of
the
great
major
league
from
the
following
record
of
the
difference
in
percentage
points
each
season
between
the
leader
and
tail
ender
it
will
be
seen
that
in
no
less
than
seven
of
the
seasons
from
to
inclusive
were
the
pennant
races
of
past
seasons
superior
in
this
respect
to
that
of
that
of
being
the
smallest
in
difference
of
points
on
record
here
is
the
record
in
question
points
of
points
of
points
of
years
difference
years
difference
years
difference
judging
by
the
percentage
figures
of
the
twelve
clubs
recorded
at
the
end
of
each
month
campaign
of
the
season
the
race
was
a
one
almost
from
the
start
the
baltimore
and
boston
clubs
being
in
the
leading
positions
from
the
very
outset
of
the
race
the
remaining
ten
clubs
fighting
for
third
place
from
april
to
june
when
new
york
took
the
lead
of
the
other
nine
joining
baltimore
and
boston
in
the
struggle
for
the
leading
position
a
league
pennant
race
or
that
of
a
minor
league
for
that
matter
to
be
up
to
the
regulation
standard
should
at
least
show
a
difference
in
percentage
figures
varying
on
the
average
not
far
from
points
a
model
race
in
these
figures
not
exceeding
points
but
this
standard
has
not
been
reached
in
league
records
for
fifteen
years
the
best
being
over
points
then
too
comes
the
record
of
the
occupancy
of
the
several
positions
of
the
two
divisions
this
to
a
certain
extent
showing
the
character
of
the
pennant
race
of
the
season
in
this
regard
an
evenly
contested
race
should
show
a
weekly
change
of
position
in
each
division
for
one
thing
and
also
a
change
from
first
division
to
second
division
at
least
once
a
month
a
model
race
should
see
the
first
three
positions
changed
weekly
the
first
six
places
at
least
fortnightly
and
the
tail
end
positions
once
a
month
at
farthest
but
what
does
the
figures
of
the
pennant
race
of
the
league
for
show
let
us
glance
at
the
records
of
the
occupancy
of
the
first
and
second
divisions
in
last
year
pennant
race
from
the
of
april
to
the
close
of
the
season
the
baltimore
and
boston
clubs
were
never
out
of
the
ranks
of
the
first
division
clubs
nor
were
the
chicago
washington
and
louisville
clubs
ever
out
of
those
of
the
second
division
this
alone
was
a
condition
of
affairs
in
the
race
from
may
to
july
the
philadelphia
and
pittsburgh
clubs
occupied
positions
in
the
first
division
and
the
cleveland
club
was
in
the
first
division
from
april
to
june
and
from
july
to
the
finish
while
new
york
was
in
the
same
division
from
june
to
the
close
and
brooklyn
from
august
to
the
end
of
the
season
on
the
other
hand
chicago
louis
and
cincinnati
together
with
washington
and
louisville
were
practically
out
of
the
race
from
may
to
september
the
april
campaign
finished
with
louis
cleveland
and
boston
tied
for
first
place
in
the
race
with
philadelphia
baltimore
and
cincinnati
following
boston
and
baltimore
occupancy
of
fourth
and
fifth
places
being
the
lowest
each
occupied
during
the
entire
season
campaign
while
cincinnati
position
tied
for
that
of
first
in
the
race
on
april
was
the
highest
that
club
reached
from
april
to
september
louis
as
tied
for
first
place
together
with
louisville
on
april
was
the
highest
these
three
clubs
reached
baltimore
was
the
first
to
reach
the
leading
place
in
the
race
that
club
being
first
with
the
percentage
figures
of
on
april
louis
occupying
the
lead
on
april
cleveland
on
may
that
club
occupying
the
leading
place
from
that
date
to
may
when
pittsburgh
jumped
into
first
place
for
a
short
time
boston
occupied
the
lead
for
the
first
time
on
april
the
nearest
new
york
got
to
the
leading
position
was
on
april
when
the
club
was
tied
for
first
place
with
boston
louis
and
washington
the
highest
position
the
phillies
reached
in
the
pennant
campaign
was
second
place
which
they
occupied
on
may
brooklyn
highest
position
was
reached
on
june
when
that
club
occupied
third
place
chicago
highest
was
eighth
place
and
the
only
clubs
which
stood
in
the
last
ditch
were
chicago
up
to
may
washington
from
may
to
august
and
afterwards
louisville
up
to
the
finish
of
the
season
for
the
first
time
in
the
annals
of
the
league
but
one
western
club
occupied
a
position
in
the
first
division
as
early
in
the
season
as
july
when
the
pittsburgh
club
stood
fourth
in
the
race
following
baltimore
boston
and
brooklyn
being
followed
by
philadelphia
and
new
york
cleveland
at
that
date
being
in
the
second
division
on
july
cleveland
replaced
brooklyn
in
the
first
division
and
remained
there
to
the
finish
of
the
race
pittsburgh
was
driven
into
the
ranks
of
the
second
division
on
august
and
failed
to
get
back
again
baltimore
had
the
pennant
virtually
in
hand
in
august
and
new
york
drove
boston
out
of
the
second
place
on
september
the
percentage
figures
of
the
three
leaders
on
that
day
showing
baltimore
to
be
in
the
van
with
new
york
and
boston
with
the
phillies
fourth
the
brooklyns
fifth
and
the
clevelands
sixth
these
relative
positions
not
afterwards
being
changed
neither
were
those
of
the
clubs
in
the
second
division
at
that
date
except
in
the
case
of
the
cincinnati
and
louis
clubs
the
team
under
the
boss
manager
chris
von
der
ahe
beating
the
combination
team
of
cincinnati
out
the
very
last
day
of
the
race
greatly
to
the
disgust
of
the
cincinnati
cranks
a
great
disappointment
to
the
louisville
cranks
whose
pet
club
started
the
season
with
a
picked
team
of
star
players
containing
three
of
league
teams
in
pfeffer
richardson
and
tom
brown
was
the
sad
falling
off
of
that
club
from
the
position
of
being
tied
for
first
place
with
baltimore
and
boston
in
april
to
a
permanent
place
in
the
last
ditch
in
august
a
result
which
relieved
manager
schmelz
considerably
as
up
to
august
washington
had
occupied
the
tail
end
position
in
the
race
from
july
to
august
similar
bad
management
of
a
club
team
had
retired
pittsburgh
from
second
position
on
june
to
seventh
place
on
july
and
it
was
only
through
a
wise
change
of
managers
that
the
club
was
able
to
retain
the
lead
in
the
second
division
to
the
end
of
the
campaign
an
incident
of
the
campaign
of
was
the
disastrous
start
in
the
race
made
by
the
chicago
club
which
occupied
the
tail
end
position
in
the
race
at
the
close
of
the
april
campaign
and
remained
in
the
last
ditch
up
to
may
after
which
the
club
gradually
passed
the
washington
louisville
cincinnati
and
st
louis
teams
finally
occupying
eighth
position
the
last
of
september
the
pennant
race
of
as
a
whole
was
a
decided
failure
as
far
as
an
evenly
contested
race
was
concerned
the
only
exception
in
the
way
of
an
exciting
struggle
for
the
lead
being
that
between
the
three
leaders
from
july
to
september
this
being
the
one
redeeming
feature
of
the
league
championship
campaign
of
the
contests
for
the
pennant
in
not
since
has
a
new
candidate
for
league
championship
been
successful
in
winning
the
pennant
but
in
another
club
was
added
to
the
list
of
league
pennant
winners
the
interest
in
the
annual
races
of
course
being
thereby
proportionately
increased
in
when
the
league
was
organized
chicago
was
the
first
city
to
win
league
championship
honors
and
in
boston
entered
the
arena
of
pennant
winners
next
came
providence
in
after
which
a
whole
decade
of
league
seasons
passed
without
a
new
pennant
winner
being
added
to
the
above
two
detroit
winning
in
for
the
first
time
next
came
new
york
in
followed
by
brooklyn
in
and
now
baltimore
has
entered
the
contest
arena
of
champion
clubs
that
city
winning
the
honors
in
during
the
intervals
of
this
period
of
nineteen
years
of
league
championship
campaigns
the
boston
and
chicago
clubs
won
the
majority
of
pennant
races
boston
carrying
off
the
flag
during
the
seasons
of
and
and
chicago
winning
in
and
this
latter
club
being
the
only
one
to
win
the
pennant
in
three
successive
years
from
to
inclusive
the
bostons
not
being
three
time
winners
until
the
seasons
of
and
that
club
however
is
the
only
one
to
win
the
championship
in
four
successive
seasons
outside
of
the
league
since
the
professional
championship
was
inaugurated
in
the
bostons
afterwards
winning
in
and
there
are
now
in
the
league
eight
clubs
out
of
the
twelve
which
have
yet
to
win
a
single
pennant
race
the
philadelphia
and
washington
clubs
of
the
eastern
divisions
and
all
six
of
the
western
clubs
there
are
also
but
four
clubs
now
in
the
league
which
have
never
reached
higher
than
second
position
since
the
league
was
organized
louisville
that
club
earned
title
to
first
place
having
been
lost
by
the
crookedness
of
four
of
its
team
of
that
year
cincinnati
in
philadelphia
in
and
pittsburgh
in
while
there
are
two
clubs
now
in
the
league
which
have
never
reached
higher
than
third
place
louis
in
and
cleveland
in
and
the
only
aspirant
for
a
position
in
league
pennant
races
higher
than
fourth
place
at
the
close
of
the
season
now
in
the
league
is
the
washington
club
so
there
is
plenty
of
room
to
win
honors
in
if
only
in
getting
in
among
the
six
leaders
by
october
next
the
three
leading
clubs
in
the
pennant
race
of
it
is
about
time
that
the
record
of
the
championship
campaigns
of
each
year
should
be
divided
up
in
order
that
the
leading
minority
of
the
competing
teams
may
be
awarded
the
additional
credit
due
them
for
obtaining
positions
of
special
distinction
during
each
season
beginning
of
course
with
the
winner
of
the
pennant
and
followed
by
the
occupants
of
and
positions
with
the
three
other
clubs
of
the
first
division
ranking
in
due
order
by
thus
extending
the
list
of
honorary
positions
in
the
race
an
additional
incentive
for
making
extra
efforts
toward
the
close
of
the
race
is
given
to
each
one
of
the
twelve
clubs
of
the
league
at
large
thus
in
the
early
part
of
the
championship
campaign
if
two
or
three
clubs
find
themselves
hopelessly
contending
for
the
pennant
itself
there
will
still
be
left
over
those
of
the
other
two
honorary
places
in
the
race
and
positions
to
compete
for
and
failing
to
achieve
success
to
that
extent
there
will
be
one
or
other
of
the
last
three
places
in
the
to
strive
for
this
opens
the
door
to
win
other
creditable
places
in
the
season
race
to
be
fought
for
by
the
six
clubs
of
the
second
division
instead
of
their
losing
heart
in
the
contest
simply
because
by
the
end
of
the
may
or
june
campaign
they
are
left
without
a
chance
of
winning
the
pennant
it
would
seem
to
be
from
this
view
of
the
case
an
object
of
special
interest
for
the
league
to
award
a
series
of
honorary
prizes
to
the
players
of
each
team
attaining
one
or
other
of
the
three
leading
positions
in
the
race
of
each
year
in
the
proportion
we
will
say
of
for
the
first
place
for
second
and
for
third
in
the
future
the
guide
will
give
special
prominence
in
its
statistical
records
to
the
clubs
attaining
second
and
third
positions
in
the
race
leaving
a
less
detailed
record
to
the
other
nine
clubs
entering
the
campaign
for
championship
honors
this
change
beginning
with
the
guide
of
we
now
present
first
in
order
the
complete
record
of
the
baltimore
champions
of
the
campaigns
of
the
three
leaders
and
of
the
first
division
clubs
for
an
interesting
statistical
chapter
of
the
guide
of
includes
the
comparative
tables
of
the
three
leaders
in
the
pennant
race
of
those
of
the
baltimore
new
york
and
boston
clubs
the
struggle
between
these
three
clubs
being
a
decidedly
attractive
feature
of
the
past
season
championship
campaign
the
season
opened
on
april
and
the
close
of
the
first
day
play
saw
the
boston
and
new
york
clubs
tied
for
first
place
with
baltimore
tied
with
four
other
clubs
for
second
place
only
eight
of
the
twelve
clubs
playing
on
that
day
by
the
end
of
the
first
month
campaign
on
april
boston
had
dropped
to
third
position
baltimore
to
fifth
place
and
new
york
down
to
ninth
in
the
race
on
may
the
close
of
the
second
month
campaign
baltimore
led
boston
being
then
in
third
position
and
boston
in
fourth
new
york
having
pulled
up
to
sixth
place
on
june
baltimore
jumped
to
first
place
with
boston
fifth
and
new
york
seventh
by
june
the
bostons
had
got
up
to
second
place
but
new
york
was
still
in
the
second
division
baltimore
of
course
still
leading
in
the
race
on
that
date
at
the
end
of
the
third
month
of
the
season
campaign
on
june
baltimore
held
the
lead
with
the
percentage
of
victories
of
with
boston
second
having
in
percentage
figures
while
new
york
had
got
back
into
the
first
division
again
with
the
figures
of
on
july
the
giants
had
worked
up
to
third
place
preceded
by
baltimore
and
boston
each
with
the
percentage
figures
respectively
of
and
it
being
a
close
fight
at
this
time
between
baltimore
and
boston
while
new
york
was
close
behind
from
july
to
the
finish
these
three
clubs
occupied
the
three
leading
positions
in
the
race
the
others
being
virtually
not
in
it
as
far
as
winning
the
pennant
was
concerned
this
fact
alone
made
the
pennant
race
of
a
very
one
as
nearly
three
months
of
the
season
games
remained
to
be
played
at
the
end
of
the
july
campaign
the
record
showed
boston
in
the
van
with
the
percentage
figures
of
to
and
new
york
boston
having
taken
the
lead
from
baltimore
on
july
it
was
just
about
this
time
that
boston
stock
on
the
racing
market
was
above
par
it
being
fully
expected
at
this
time
that
the
best
the
baltimores
would
be
likely
to
accomplish
would
be
to
retain
second
place
while
new
yorkers
were
sanguine
at
this
period
of
the
contest
that
the
giants
would
soon
lead
baltimore
the
boston
champions
retained
first
position
up
to
july
while
new
york
tried
in
vain
to
push
baltimore
out
of
second
place
by
the
close
of
the
august
campaign
the
baltimores
by
a
brilliant
rally
had
replaced
boston
in
the
lead
the
record
on
august
showing
baltimore
in
the
van
with
the
percentage
figures
of
followed
by
boston
with
and
new
york
close
to
the
champions
with
now
came
a
grand
fight
for
second
place
on
the
part
of
new
york
the
bostons
from
this
time
to
the
finish
failing
to
make
the
accustomed
final
rally
which
their
friends
had
anticipated
on
september
new
york
ousted
boston
out
of
second
place
at
which
date
baltimore
led
with
the
percentage
figures
of
followed
by
new
york
with
boston
figures
being
the
rest
of
the
clubs
in
the
first
division
at
that
time
being
in
the
five
hundreds
only
in
percentage
figures
boston
got
down
to
on
september
new
york
being
then
credited
with
and
baltimore
way
up
with
it
was
now
baltimore
race
and
new
york
was
regarded
as
a
fixture
for
second
position
there
being
a
difference
in
percentage
points
between
baltimore
and
boston
of
no
less
than
points
on
september
new
york
then
being
behind
baltimore
points
and
ahead
of
boston
points
in
fact
a
week
before
the
finish
on
september
the
positions
of
the
three
leaders
were
fixtures
the
only
interest
left
remaining
being
the
struggle
between
philadelphia
brooklyn
and
cleveland
for
fourth
place
as
before
remarked
the
chief
interest
in
the
september
campaign
was
the
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
majority
of
the
patrons
of
the
game
that
the
bostons
would
rally
towards
the
finish
and
that
the
baltimores
would
fall
off
during
the
last
week
or
two
instead
however
it
was
the
boston
champions
who
failed
to
play
up
to
their
old
mark
while
it
was
the
baltimores
who
did
the
rallying
and
in
fine
style
too
under
the
leadership
of
the
champion
manager
of
the
campaign
of
the
new
champions
of
the
baltimore
club
career
we
have
the
pleasure
of
greeting
a
new
champion
club
in
the
league
arena
in
the
guide
of
the
baltimore
club
and
it
is
therefore
a
point
of
interest
to
give
a
brief
resume
of
its
career
from
the
time
it
entered
the
defunct
american
association
in
to
the
date
of
its
being
taken
into
the
reconstructed
national
league
in
the
baltimore
club
career
in
the
late
american
association
was
one
thing
that
of
its
progress
since
the
club
was
taken
into
the
national
league
is
altogether
quite
a
different
matter
from
the
year
of
the
organizing
of
the
old
american
association
up
to
the
period
of
its
secession
from
the
national
agreement
ranks
in
the
baltimore
club
occupied
the
position
of
being
the
occupant
of
the
last
ditch
in
the
association
pennant
races
for
no
less
than
four
years
in
and
in
when
twelve
clubs
were
in
the
association
race
of
that
year
the
highest
the
baltimore
club
reached
was
sixth
position
in
and
the
club
got
no
higher
than
fifth
place
in
the
three
races
of
those
years
while
the
nearest
it
could
get
to
first
place
during
the
decade
of
the
eighties
was
in
when
it
ended
in
third
place
being
led
by
louis
and
cincinnati
during
all
that
period
william
barnie
was
the
club
manager
in
he
was
superseded
by
manager
hanlon
and
from
that
date
to
the
close
of
the
past
season
the
club
began
to
get
out
of
its
previous
slough
of
despond
induced
by
its
repeated
failures
to
win
a
pennant
race
here
is

the

badly
beaten

only
that

experience
enabled

hanlon
to

a
better
chance
of
success
than
he
had
had
since
he
took
the
club
in

the

being

much
kicking

playing

mcgraw
was

the
records
of

clubs
of
the
new

club
team
entered
the
campaign
of
decidedly
handicapped
the
club
had
excellent
material
at
command
wherewith
to
make
up
a
strong
team
but
the
manager
had
great
difficulty
at
first
in
getting
it
into
team
work
condition
he
being
hampered
by
the
interference
of
the
class
of
scribe
managers
of
league
cities
who
are
very
confident
of
their
ability
to
run
a
club
team
better
on
paper
than
the
actual
manager
can
on
the
field
then
too
a
minority
of
these
journalists
seem
to
delight
in
getting
up
sensations
which
lead
to
discord
in
the
ranks
of
a
team
as
they
have
their
pet
players
on
the
teams
as
well
as
those
they
have
a
special
grudge
against
moreover
the
directors
of
the
club
were
at
times
in
the
early
part
of
the
season
not
in
accord
with
the
manager
in
his
methods
of
selecting
players
and
in
appointing
them
to
special
positions
finally
the
experience
of
april
and
may
taught
the
club
officials
that
if
much
more
of
the
interference
racket
was
continued
the
result
would
be
a
permanent
place
in
the
second
division
inasmuch
as
on
may
the
club
stood
no
higher
than
eighth
place
with
but
little
likelihood
at
that
time
of
getting
any
higher
by
june
however
an
improved
condition
of
affairs
in
running
the
team
was
manifested
the
scribe
managers
were
ignored
the
manager
was
given
more
control
of
the
team
and
by
the
close
of
the
june
campaign
the
new
york
club
was
in
the
first
division
and
by
the
end
of
july
were
among
the
three
leaders
where
they
remained
until
the
end
of
the
race
the
club
was
fortunate
in
being
able
to
make
its
team
unusually
strong
in
its
battery
players
the
very
profitable
and
liberal
investment
made
by
director
wheeler
in
the
purchase
of
the
release
of
meekin
and
farrell
was
a
potent
factor
in
enabling
the
club
to
reach
the
high
position
it
did
both
of
these
model
players
in
their
respective
positions
proving
to
be
a
great
accession
to
the
strength
of
the
team
another
valuable
acquisition
to
their
team
was
that
noted
college
player
young
murphy
he
proving
to
be
the
most
valuable
utility
man
in
the
club
and
an
equal
of
ward
in
batting
by
the
closing
month
of
the
campaign
the
team
had
been
trained
up
to
the
point
of
working
together
in
more
harmony
besides
doing
better
in
their
batting
than
any
previous
players
of

had
ever

pennant
winners
three
years
in
succession
was
obliged
to
fall
back
to
third
place
in

past
year
pennant
race
after
a
hard
fight
for
first
place
in
the
race
from
april
to
september
that
club
standing
in
first
place
on
april
and
also
on
the
of
august
they
varying
their
position
but
little
during
that
period
hitherto
in
the
races
of
and
the
bostons
were
noted
for
their
rallying
powers
not
only
in
the
latter
part
of
a
game
but
especially
in
the
closing
month
of
each
season
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
though
they
had
to
succumb
to
cleveland
in
the
last
part
of
the
divided
campaign
of
that
year
they
rallied
handsomely
and
easily
won
the
championship
in
the
world
series
of
that
year
this
year
however
they
went
back
on
their
record
badly
in
failing
to
attend
to
the
rallying
business
in
the
last
month
of
the
campaign
the
result
being
that
they
not
only
lost
the
pennant
but
had
to
submit
to
being
forced
into
third
place
in
the
race
the
question
as
to
why
this
was
thusly
is
not
easy
to
answer
it
may
be
said
for
one
thing
that
the
loss
of
the
valuable
services
of
the
veteran
bennett
was
one
drawback
to
their
success
and
the
failure
of
a
majority
of
their
pitchers
another
their
only
really
successful
battery
team
being
nichols
and
ganzel
then
too
they
lost
ground
in
playing
as
well
as
in
popularity
by
the
kicking
and
noisy
coaching
profanities
of
a
minority
of
their
team
that
kind
of
hustling
in
a
team
having
become
played
out
as
a
winning
factor
in
the
game
in
it
must
not
be
forgotten
however
that
the
boston
club
in
encountered
stronger

they
did
goes
without

it

the
cleveland
club
did
not
begin
their
opening
campaign
until
april
and
then
in
the
ranks
of
the
second
division
but
they
soon
jumped
to
the
front
and
by
the
end
of
the
april
campaign
they
stood
a
tie
for
first
place
with
boston
and
louis
with
the
percentage
figures
of
each
they
opened
the
may
campaign
by
pushing
boston
out
of
first
place
and
they
retained
the
leading
position
from
may
to
the
they
reaching
the
high
percentage
of
on
may
the
highest
of
the
season
on
decoration
day
pittsburgh
went
to
the
front
with
the
percentage
of
to
cleveland
and
they
retained
that
position
to
the
close
of
the
may
campaign
during
june
the
clevelands
fell
off
and
by
the
of
that
month
they
had
got
down
to
fifth
place
in
the
race
and
by
the
end
of
the
june
campaign
had
been
driven
into
the
ranks
of
the
second
division
they
then
occupying
seventh
place
with
a
percentage
of
pittsburgh
on
june
being
the
only
western
team
in
the
first
division
this
fact
alone
showed
a
race
up
to
that
date
the
clevelands
did
not
get
back
into
the
first
division
until
july
and
after
that
they
never
left
it
during
august
they
battled
well
for
third
place
but
could
get
no
higher
than
fourth
position
where
they
stood
up
to
august
when
they
began
to
fall
off
and
on
august
they
were
down
to
sixth
place
this
position
they
were
forced
to
keep
all
through
september
up
to
the
finish
of
the
race
the
cleveland
team
managed
to
win
two
of
their
series
with
the
eastern
clubs
with
washington
and
philadelphia
but
were
badly
whipped
by
the
three
leaders
they
managed
however
to
make
a
close
fight
of
it
with
their
old
antagonists
of
brooklyn
the
latter
winning
the
series
by
a
single
game
only
with
their
western
rivals
the
clevelands
won
every
series
but
one
that
with
the
pittsburgh
club
thereby
winning
the
of
the
west
as
boston
did
the
championship
of
the
east
then
too
the
clevelands
were
the
only
western
club
remaining
in
the
first
division
at
the
close
of
the
season
so
they
had
some
consolation
in
the
race
in
excelling
their
western
rivals
all
of
whom
they
beat
out
in
the
race
even
if
they
failed
to
win
the
pennant
or
to
get
among
the
three
leaders
in
the
race
moreover
they
excelled
all
the
western
teams
in
team
work
in
the
field
and
at
the
bat
as
they
did
the
brooklyns
and
washingtons
of

the

the
season
of
was
made
noteworthy
in

annals

the
washington

to
their
being
able
to
pay
off
their
six
years
mortgage
on
the
last
ditch
and
transferred
it
to
the
louisville

the

opened
the
season
in
a
very
lively
style
inasmuch
as
they
stood
a
tie
for
first
place
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
of
the
campaign
and
had
the
credit
of
winning
their

games
with
the
phillies
the

and
boston

after
this
dash
at
the
start
they
settled
down
among

season
resigned

the
fate
of

kept
them
out

fell
into

where
they
remained
until

when
to

tied
all

they

they
being
shut
out
by
the

with

they
lost
thirteen
successive
games
one
of
which
was
thrown
out
the
club
management
of
the
management
of
the
twelve
league
clubs
in
was
in
but
few
instances
in
advance
of
that
of
and
in
a
minority
of
cases
it
was
worse
the
experience
of
the
past
season
in
the
management
of
club
teams
points
out
the
indisputable
fact
that
the
majority
of
managers
are
blind
to
the
folly
of
condoning
drinking
offences
in
the
ranks
for
one
thing
and
equally
ignorant
of
the
damaging
effects
in
lessening
the
reputable
patronage
of
their
grounds
of
countenancing
that
phase
of
hoodlumism
in
teams
known
as
kicking
against
the
decisions
of
umpires
despite
of
the
costly
experience
of
the
past
five
years
in
the
countenancing
of
drunkards
in
the
league
ranks
we
see
this
season
of
club
teams
including
players
notorious
for
their
old
drunken
habits
why
managers
can
not
perceive
the
folly
of
such
men
is
a
mystery
no
matter
what
their
skill
at
the
bat
or
in
the
field
may
be
their
drinking
habits
with
the
demoralizing
effect
on
the
teams
at
large
which
follows
more
than
offset
the
advantage
of
their
alleged
ability
in
the
field
despite
this
obvious
fact
however
club
officials
either
presidents
directors
or
managers
still
blunder
on
in
having
these
drunkards
on
their
teams
even
after
condoning
their
offences
time
and
again
on
the
promise
of
reform
which
in
no
single
instance
has
ever
taken
place
that
i
am
aware
of
but
surpassing
this
folly
is
that
of
engaging
ugly
and
vicious
tempered
players
for
their
teams
who
are
simply
demoralizing
agents
in
any
team
on
which
they
are
engaged
these
fellows
are
not
only
death
to
necessary
discipline
but
they
are
sure
to
find
occasions
to
form
cliques
in
a
team
which
war
against
the
best
interests
of
the
club
at
large
and
are
obnoxious
in
the
extreme
to
the
pennant
winning
rule
of
for
the
a
rule
as
important
to
the
success
of
a
club
team
in
a
pennant
race
as
the
reserve
rule
is
to
the
life
of
the
professional
club
business
at
large
bad
management
of
clubs
involves
a
variety
of
blunders
not
only
in
the
running
of
the
team
without
regard
to
business
principles
sadly
neglected
by
a
majority
of
the
league
clubs
in
but
especially
in
the
making
up
of
teams
in
the
spring
months
in
which
one
blunder
is
conspicuous
that
of
selecting
players
for
each
team
without
regard
to
their
ability
to
play
in
but
solely
by
the
records
made
in
the
unreliable
table
of
averages
of
the
past
season
in
which
everything
in
the
way
of
scoring
figures
tends
to
aid
the
mere
record
player
and
throws
obstacles
in
the
way
of
team
work
players
records
another
managerial
blunder
is
shown
in
the
gathering
together
of
a
long
list
of
signed
players
with
the
view
of
selecting
a
strong
team
of
a
dozen
players
from
the
crowd
for
the
serious
work
of
the
campaign
for
instance
in
the
makeup
of
many
of
the
league
teams
of
the
blunder
of
getting
together
six
or
eight
pitchers
and
occupying
the
whole
of
the
early
part
of
the
campaign
in
experiments
with
them
was
positive
folly
it
has
never
paid
in
a
single
instance
it
was
in
fact
death
to
the
success
of
at
least
four
league
teams
last
season
cincinnati
in
particular
many
of
last
year
team
managers
failed
to
realize
the
important
fact
that
in
testing
the
merits
of
pitchers
in
the
spring
season
they
need
to
be
given
a
fair
trial
and
not
dismiss
them
after
the
hasty
judgment
of
their
ability
of
a
few
games
of
trial
pitchers
need
to
be
thoroughly
tested
before
they
are
released
after
engagement
and
this
testing
process
can
not
at
the
shortest
be
done
in
less
than
a
month
trial
no
pitcher
can
do
his
best
while
in
doubt
all
the
while
as
to
the
result
of
a
single
day
play
on
his
engagement
five
pitchers
are
amply
sufficient
to
begin
a
season
with
and
at
most
three
catchers
but
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
costly
blunders
in
team
management
made
in
was
that
of
encouraging
hoodlumism
by
the
countenancing
of
blackguard
kicking
in
defiance
of
the
laws
of
the
game
which
presidents
and
directors
as
well
as
managers
and
captains
were
alike
guilty
of
to
a
more
or
less
extent
the
rules
of
the
game
positively
prohibit
any
player
of
a
nine
on
the
field
from
disputing
any
decision
of
the
umpire
except
the
captain
and
he
only
in
certain
exceptional
cases
and
yet
not
only
did
captains
of
teams
allow
this
rule
to
be
violated
in
every
game
of
the
season
but
they
were
openly
countenanced
in
it
by
not
only
their
managers
but
in
many
cases
by
club
presidents
and
directors
under
such
circumstances
is
it
any
wonder
that
the
season
of
stands
on
record
as
being
marked
by
more
disgraceful
kicking
rowdy
play
blackguard
language
and
brutal
play
than
that
of
any
season
since
the
league
was
organized
and
all
this
was
the
result
of
a
neglect
of
business
principles
in
club
management
and
in
the
blunders
in
managing
teams
committed
by
incompetent
managers
and
captains

the

other

the
only
western

out

of
course
such
a
condition
of
things
in

race
led
to
a
falling
off
in
the
interest
in

out

greatly

as
early
as

as

as
winning
the

was
concerned
during

there
were
only
two
points
of
interest
in
the
race
outside
of
the
fight
for
first
place
between
the
three
leaders
the
struggle
between
the
brooklyn
and
philadelphia
clubs
for

place
in

that
between

in

the

by

of

the

the

the

again
by
the
of

after
which
date
they
remained
in

division
to
the
close
of
the

a
feature
of
the
july
campaign
among
the
six
clubs
was
the
close
fight
between
washington
and
louisville
on
the
edge
of
the

ditch
first
one
club
would
cross
the
goal
line

it

then
the
other
louisville

the

a
result
that
was
ruinous
to

to

clubs

very
reverse
for

baltimore

the

the

for

all

this

position

both

failed

projects
up

the

tried
in
vain
to
send
the
bostons
down
to
third
place
but
it
was
not
until
the
of

that
they
were
able
to
oust
the

out

in

and
when
they
did
so
they
kept
them
out
to
the
finish
the

failing
to
rally
after

it
was
a
close
fight
however

by

the

baltimore
out

was
that
boston
would

pulled
up
to

from

by

only

had

being

now
came
the
trying
month
of

with
it
came
the
customary
falling

character

the

of
the
pitching

was
in

of
that
of
but
it
has
yet
to
reach
the
point
of
perfect
work
in
the

somehow
or
other
managers
of
teams
can
not
get
it
out
of
their
heads
that
great
speed
is
the
principal
factor
of
success
in
pitching
when
the
fact
is
that
speed
is
but
an
aid
to
success
secondary
in
value
to
that
of
strategic
skill
in
delivering
the
ball
to
the
bat
the
experience
of
the
past
season
in
connection
with
the
limit
of
speed
in
pitching
presents
some
valuable
suggestions
which
team
managers
will
do
well
to
bear
in
mind
this
year
some
years
ago
the
swift
pitching
which
had
then
about
reached
the
highest
point
of
speed
proved
to
be
so
costly
in
its
wear
and
fear
upon
the
catchers
that
clubs
had
to
engage
a
corps
of
reserve
catchers
in
order
to
go
through
a
season
campaign
with
any
degree
of
success
afterward
however
the
introduction
of
the
protective
mitts
led
to
some
relief
being
afforded
the
catchers
who
had
been
called
upon
to
face
the
swift
pitching
of
the
cyclone
pitchers
of
the
period
the
seasons
of
and
were
marked
by
some
exhibitions
of
swift
pitching
unequaled
in
the
annals
of
the
game
and
yet
it
was
not
effective
in
placing
the
team
which
held
the
cyclone
pitchers
in
the
lead
if
the
speed
of
the
ball
is
too
great
for
catchers
to
handle
even
with
the
protection
the
breast
pads
masks
and
the
padded
gloves
of
the
period
afford
why
then
it
is
worse
than
useless
it
was
skilful
strategic
pitching
which
helped
to
win
the
pennant
in
and
not
cyclone
pitching
speed
is
all
very
well
as
an
important
accessory
but
without
the
best
of
catching
to
support
it
and
thorough
command
of
the
ball
to
give
it
full
effect
it
is
more
costly
than
otherwise
the
pitching
percentages
for
the
champion
baltimore
club
record
the
complete
record
of
the
pitching
percentages
of
victories
pitched
in
shows
that
baltimore
full
season
team
of
pitchers
had
a
general
percentage
of
victories
pitched
in
of
by
the
eight
pitchers
who
occupied
the
box
during
the
season
campaign
this
record
excelled
the
percentage
figures
of
new
york
team
of
five
pitchers
by
points
and
that
of
boston
seven
pitchers
by
points
the
respective
percentage
figures
being
and
these
figures
show
the
relative
strength
of
the
three
battery
teams
as
far
as
the
record
of
percentage
can
show
them
a
better
criterion
of
pitching
skill
would
be
of
course
at
command
were
the
scoring
rules
giving
the
data
of
runs
earned
off
the
pitching
revised
properly
but
as
they
were
not

we
have
to
take
the
next
best

the
records
of
the

we
do
not

to
award

led
mcmahon

the

pitching

with
the
fewest

of

moreover

the

followed

pitchers
rusie

clarke
with
catchers
wilson
and
doyle
the
club
presented
battery
strength
sufficient
to
have
carried
the
team
to
the
goal
but
for
sundry
drawbacks
they
met
with
during
the
early
part
of
the
championship
campaign
especially
during
april
and
may
and
handicapped
as
they
were
they
managed
to
close
the
season
in
second
place
after
brilliant
rallying
work
during
the
last
three
months
of
the
campaign
when
their
pitchers
were
well
backed
up
by
better
than
they
had
at
command
up
to
july
in
giving
the
record
of
the
work
done
by
the
club
pitchers
we
have
deemed
it
essential
to
divide
the
tables
up
into
sections
showing
the
work
done
in
the
box
against
both
the
eastern
and
western
teams
separately
as
well
as
the
table
showing
the
aggregate
figures
of
the
individual
percentages
of
victories
pitched
in
thus
it
will
be
seen
in
the
appended
table
that
while
meekin
pitching
was
more
successful
against
the
batsmen
of
the
eastern
teams
rusie
excelled
meekin
in
downing
the
batsmen
of
the
western
teams
by
a
percentage
of
victories
of
against
for
meekin
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
in
pitching
against
the
batsmen
of
the
three
leading
teams
in
the
race
opposed
to
them
meekin
pitched
in
victories
out
of
games
while
rusie
only
pitched
in
victories
out
of
games
against
the
three
most
successful
of
the
western
teams
too
meekin
pitched
in
victories
against
rusie
taking
the
season
figures
as
a
whole
meekin
led
rusie
by
the
percentage
figures
of
to
quite
a
difference
in
favor
of
meekin
german
led
westervelt
against
the
eastern
teams
but
the
latter
led
against
the
western
batsmen
and
also
had
the
best
percentage
figures
in
the
aggregate
of
the
season
by
to
german
clark
being
in
the
last
ditch
in
all
three
tables
westervelt
was
a
new
man
in
the
field
compared
to
german
but
he
is
very
likely
to
excel
his
last
year
record
in
the
best
individual
records
in
victories
pitched
in
by
the
two
leaders
were
rusie
to

to

it

the

the

was
weakened
in
the

manner
as
the
cincinnati

by
experimenting
with
too
many
pitchers
they
using

in

during

campaign
in

one
exceeded
the

of
of

over

were

who
pitched

and
under

led

was
a
bad
failure
as
he
only
pitched

out

present
quite
an

the

being

find
out
which
of

did
the
best
work
in

respect
not

by

largest
total
in

kennedy
was
the
most
successful
and
yet
he
only
stole
in

now
the
problem
is
which
pitcher
did
the
best
average
work
in
his
position
and
we
leave
that
for
our
readers
to
solve
it
is
alleged
that
the
reason
pitchers
do
so
little
in
stealing
bases
is
that
they
are
too
fatigued
in
their
pitching
in
each
inning
to
do
much
in
the
active
work
of
base
running
both
duties
trying
a
player
nerves
considerably
for
this
reason
it
would
be
a
good
plan
in
the
order
of
batting
to
have
a
sure
hitter
follow
each
pitcher
so
as
to
help
bat
him
round
hints
to
the
pitchers
of
we
are
glad
to
record
the
fact
that
scientific
pitching
is
advancing
in
the
league
arena
its
progress
hitherto
has
been
slow
and
only
step
by
step
but
it
is
making
headway
and
during
the
science
of
strategic
pitching
made
greater
progress
than
ever
before
the
effective
blow
given
to
cyclone
pitching
by
the
new
pitching
rules
which
went
into
effect
in
while
it
did
not
materially
affect
the
strategic
class
of
pitchers
some
of
whom
the
new
rules
actually
benefited
obliged
the
class
of
pitchers
who
depend
solely
upon
their
dangerous
speed
for
success
to
adopt
strategic
tactics
to
a
more
or
less
extent
and
this
is
why
a
few
of
the
old
cyclone
pitchers
as
they
are
called
succeeded
better
than
they
anticipated
under
the
change
made
in
the
rules
in
which
had
placed
them
farther
from
the
batsman
than
in
it
may
be
said
in
connection
with
the
pitching
of
that
one
thing
noticeable
in
the
box
work
of
that
season
was
that
the
brainy
class
of
men
in
the
position
began
to
pay
more
attention
to
the
advice
of
the
theorists
of
the
game
than
before
and
thereby
they
learned
to
realize
the
fact
that
skill
and
that
equally
important
attribute
thorough
control
of
together
with
the
avoidance
of
the
senseless
in
vogue
had
more
to
do
with
success
in
their
position
than
they
had
previously
been
aware
those
of
the
pitching
fraternity
who
read
up
on
the
subject
of
skill
in
pitching
were
told
that
the
primary
elements
of
strategic
work
in
the
box
included
first
to
deceive
the
eye
of
the
batsman
in
regard
to
the
character
of
the
delivery
of
the
ball
as
to
its
being
fast
or
slow
second
to
deceive
his
judgment
in
reference
to
the
direction
of
the
ball
when
pitched
to
him
as
to
its
being
high
or
low
or
where
he
wants
it
third
to
watch
the
batsman
closely
so
as
to
know
just
when
he
is
temporarily
of
form
for
making
a
good
hit
and
fourth
to
tempt
him
with
a
ball
which
will
be
likely
to
go
high
from
his
bat
to
the
outfield
and
be
caught
then
again
they
were
told
that
another
very
effective
point
in
strategic
pitching
is
a
thoroughly
disguised
change
of
pace
in
delivery
this
is
difficult
of
attainment
and
as
a
general
rule
it
can
only
be
played
with
effect
on
the
careless
class
of
batsmen
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
pitcher
who
can
not
control
his
temper
is
as
unfit
for
his
position
as
is
a
billiard
player
to
excel
as
a
winner
in
professional
contests
quick
temper
is
the
mortal
foe
of
cool
judgment
and
it
plays
the
mischief
with
that
nervy
condition
so
necessary
in
the
development
of
skilful
strategy
the
pitcher
must
of
necessity
be
subject
to
annoyances
well
calculated
to
try
a
temper
especially
when
his
best
efforts
in
pitching
are
rendered
useless
by
the
blunders
of
incompetent
fielders
but
under
such
trying
circumstances
his
triumph
is
all
the
greater
if
he
can
pluck
victory
out
of
the
fire
of
such
opposition
the
thorough
control
of
his
this

it

against

meekin
all
against
the
eastern

rusie
having
the
highest
individual
percentage
of
victories
against
a
single
section
there
can
be
no
really
reliable
criterion
of
a
pitcher
skill
as
judged
by
the
data
of
his

until
the
figures
of
runs
earned
off
the
pitching
solely
by
base
hits
and
not
by
base

and
stolen
bases
and
the
errors
they
lead
to
combined
as
is
the
case
under
the
defective
scoring
rules
in
existence
in
to
call
a
run
scored
by
a
combination
of
base
hits
and
stolen
bases
is
unjust
to
the
pitcher
while
judging
his
pitching
by
the
percentage
of
victories
pitched
is
only
less
faulty
but
the
latter
is
the
better
criterion
of
skill
than
that
of
earned
runs
as
calculated
on
the
basis
of
the
rules
of
the
official
averages
for
the
official

as
prepared
by
secretary
young
of
the
national
league
from
data
furnished
him
under
the
regulation
scoring
rules
of
each
year
have
always
been
more
or
less
defective
as
far
as
affording
a
reliable
criterion
of
play
in
each
department
of
the
game
was
concerned
and
necessarily
so
owing
to
the
faulty
scoring
rules
in
existence
up
to
the
batting
averages
are
more
than
useless

they
fail
to
show
the
only
reliable
criterion
of
play
there
is
and
that
is
percentage
of
runners
forwarded
around
the
bases
by
base
the
pitching
averages
are
similarly
useless

they
fail

the
correct
data

judging
the
percentage
of
runs
earned
off
the
pitching
on
the
basis

fielding

stealing
leads
to
a
class
of
errors
aside
from
regular
fielding
errors
glancing
at
the
record
of
the
leading
batsmen
since
we
find
that
the

of

this
being
the

shows

together
with
his

sacrifice

weakness
in
batting
percentage

on

and
of
the
times
he
took
his

on

the
figures
showing
total
bases
is
only
of
more
advantage
to
record
batsmen
than
to
at
the
bat
and
if
left
out
would
cause
the
fungo
hitting
class
of
batsmen
to
strive
to
do
more
teamwork
at
the
bat
than
they
do
now
another
column
might
be
added
showing
the
percentage
of
runners
forwarded
by
extra
base
hits
as
regards
the
pitching
averages
they
are
equally
unreliable
in
affording
a
criterion
of
excellence
of
play
in
the
box
how
is
it
possible
to
tell
how
effective
a
pitcher
is
by
the
figures
of
earned
runs
as
recorded
under
the
scoring
rules
in
vogue
up
to
a
batsman
for
instance
gets
to
first
base
by
a
fly
ball
which
dropped
between
two
fielders
running
to
catch
the
ball
a
base
hit
is
scored
the
hit
really
giving
an
easy
chance
for
a
catch
this
is
followed
by
two
steals
sending
the
runner
to
third
and
a
single
base
hit
sends
him
home
and
by
the
combined
play
an
earned
run
off
the
pitching
is
unjustly
earned
another
instance
of
this
kind
is
shown
when
the
first
batsman
is
given
a
life
by
a
dropped
fly
ball
the
second
is
given
another
life
by
a
muffed
ball
from
an
infield
hit
and
the
third
man
at
the
bat
is
given
a
life
by
a
wild
throw
to
first
base
after
which
three
batsmen
make
safe
hits
and
before
the
side
is
put
out
three
runs
are
scored
as
earned
though
the
side
should
have
been
put
out
had
the
pitcher
field
support
been
up
to
even
ordinary
mark
the
fact
being
that
not
a
single
run
was
really
earned
off
the
pitching
yet
three
earned
runs
are
scored
against
the
pitcher
under
the
scoring
rules
up
to
date
other
instances
of
the
uselessness
of
the
existing
method
of
making
out
the
league
averages
could
be
readily
cited
but
these
amply
suffice
we
think
one
thing
against
improvement
in
the
scoring
rules
is
first
the
fact
that
the
magnates
have
the
power
to
revise
the
amendments
made
by
the
committee
on
rules
another
is
the
failure
as
a
rule
to
appoint
that
committee
so
as
to
secure
an
efficient
working
committee
but
even
when
this
is
done
their
good
work
is
knocked
in
the
head
by
the
majority
vote
of
the
magnates
at
the
spring
meeting
the
vote
should
be
made
unanimous
in
changing
any
rule
favorably
reported
by
the
committee
here
are
the

official
averages

the
batting
of
the
at
the
bat
it
goes
to
the
credit
of
the
leading
teams
in
the
pennant
race
of
that
the
first
three
clubs
did
better
at
the
bat
and
more
of
it
than
any
previous
trio
of
the
kind
known
in
the
annals
of
the
league
in
fact
competent
managers
and
captains
of
teams
have
learned
in
recent
years
by
costly
experiment
that
one
of
the
most
potent
factors
in
winning
pennants
is
the
method
of
handling
the
ash
known
as
good
at
the
the
very
essence
of
which
is
devoting
all
the
batsmen
efforts
to
runners
by
base
and
not
by
each
player
going
to
the
bat
simply
to
build
up
a
high
record
of
base
hits
without
regard
to
forwarding
runners
on
bases
suppose
the
first
baseman
in
a
game
to
take
his
position
at
the
bat
makes
a
two
or
at
the
outset
of
course
the
object
of
the
batsman
who
succeeds
him
would
be
to
send
the
runner
home
the
best
way
he
can
either
by
a
base
hit
or
a
sacrifice
hit
in
striving
to
do
this
the
very
worst
plan
is
to
try
solely
for
a
home
run
hit
as
it
only
succeeds
once
in
thirty
or
forty
times
and
not
that
against
skilful
strategic
pitching
time
and
again
were
batsmen
last
season
left
on
third
base
after
opening
the
innings
with
a
owing
to
the
stupid
work
of
the
succeeding
batsmen
in
trying
to
line
out
for
a
homer
instead
of
doing
real
at
the
bat
of
course
good
sacrifice
hitting
is
part
and
parcel
of
at
the
bat
but
this
kind
of
hitting
was
not
done
to
any
special
extent
last
season
by
a
majority
of
the
league
batsmen
sacrifice
hitting
there
is
one
thing
about
the
point
of
play
in
batting
known
as
sacrifice
hitting
which
is
not
as
thoroughly
understood
as
it
should
be
a
majority
of
batsmen
seem
to
be
of
the
impression
that
when
they
are
called
upon
to
forward
a
base
runner
by
a
sacrifice
hit
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
go
to
the
bat
and
have
themselves
put
out
so
that
the
base
runner
at
first
base
may
be
able
to
reach
second
base
on
the
play
which
puts
the
batsmen
out
this
is
a
very
erroneous
idea
of
the
true
intent
of
a
sacrifice
hit
no
skilful
batsmen
ever
goes
to
the
bat
purposely
to
hit
the
ball
so
as
to
have
himself
put
out
that
would
be
a
very
silly
move
on
the
contrary
he
takes
his
bat
in
hand
every
time
with
the
primary
object
of
a
base
if
he
possibly
can
but
in
trying
for
this
strongest
point
in
batting
he
proposes
to
make
the
desired
hit
in
such
a
way
that
if
he
fails
to
make
the
base
hit
he
will
at
least
hit
the
ball
in
that
direction
in
the
field
which
will
oblige
the
fielders
to
throw
him
out
at
first
base
with
this
object
in
view
he
will
always
strive
for
a
safe
hit
to
especially
by
means
of
a
hard
bounder
in
that
direction
so
as
to
force
the
second
baseman
to
run
to
right
short
to
field
the
ball
in
which
case
the
runner
at
first
base
will
be
able
to
steal
to
second
on
the
hit
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
another
good
effort
for
a
sacrifice
hit
is
to
the
ball
so
that
it
may
roll
towards
third
base
out
of
reach
of
the
baseman
or
pitcher
a
third
sacrifice
hit
is
that
of
a
long
high
ball
to
the
outfield
which
admits
of
a
chance
for
a
catch
but
so
far
out
in
the
field
that
the
runner
will
have
an
opportunity
to
steal
a
base
on
the
catch
this
latter
point
wo
work
of
course
when
two
men
are
out
moreover
it
should
be
the
last
point
aimed
at
a
great
deal
of
bosh
has
been
written
mostly
by
the
admirers
of
fungo
hitting
about
sacrifice
hitting
being
something
that
should
not
be
in
the
game
just
as
these
try
to
write
down
hitting
the
most
difficult
place
hit
known
to
the
game
this
class
of
writers
think
that
the
very
acme
of
batting
skill
is
the
home
run
hit
a
hit
which
any
muscular
novice
in
batting
on
amateur
fields
can
accomplish
without
difficulty
and
where
more
home
runs
are
made
in
a
single
season
than
in
two
seasons
by
the
best
managed
professional
teams
the
effort
to
make
home
runs
leads
to
more
chances
for
catches
by
outfielders
in
one
game
than
there
are
home
runs
made
in
fifty
the
exhaustion
which
follows
a
home
run
hit
with
its
sprinting
run
of
yards
at
full
speed
is
entirely
lost
sight
of
by
the
class
of
patrons
of
the
game
who
favor
home
runs
one
season
a
few
years
ago
the
team
of
the
league
excelled
all
its
rivals
in
scoring
home
runs
while
the
team
took
the
honors
and
the
prize
solely
on
account
of
its
excellence
in
at
the
bat
the
mere
record
of
the
best
averages
in
scoring
base
hits
in
batting
seems
to
be
regarded
by
the
majority
of
cranks
in
base
ball
as
the
only
sound
criterion
of
good
batting
this
is
one
of
the
fallacies
of
the
game
as
such
a
record
is
unreliable
the
only
true
criterion
of
good
batting
is
the
record
which
shows
the
players
who
excel
in
the
batting
which
forwards
runners
and
this
record
the
existing
scoring
rules
up
to
did
not
admit
of
the
champion
batsman
being
regarded
as
the
one
who
excels
in
his
average
without
regard
to
the
runners
his
base
hits
forwarded
for
instance
one
batsman
in
a
game
will
make
three
and
forward
but
a
single
runner
by
his
three
hits
while
another
batsman
by
a
single
base
hit
a
good
bunt
hit
and
a
telling
sacrifice
hit
will
forward
and
yet
by
the
existing
scoring
rules
the
record
batsman
carries
off
all
the
honors
in
the
score
and
the
at
the
bat
does
not
get
the
slightest
credit
for
the
effective
batting

has

as

show
it
would

that
the

the
batting

we

taken
from
the
official

of

giving
the

the

not

much
account
except
in
the
showing
of
the
comparative
base
hit
and
sacrifice
hit
batting
the
larger
total
of
the
latter
giving
the
palm
in
case
of
a
tie
in
the
base
hit
averages
it
also
shows
as
far
as
sacrifice
hit
figures
can
show
which
batsman
did
the
best
batting
but
the
one
thing
wanting
in
the
record
of
batting
averages
is
the
data
showing
the
runners
forwarded
by
base
hits
and
until
the
scoring
rules
give
such
data
there
can
be
no
correct
data
useful
as

another

that

base
running
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
by
the
rulemakers
of
the
league
and
especially
by
the
magnates
who
pass
upon
the
work
done
by
the
rules
committee
that
base
running
has
come
to
be
as
much
of
an
art
in
the
game
as
is
skilful
strategic
pitching
or
in
batting
especially
has
skill
in
stealing
bases
become
a
potent
factor
in

games
and
year
after
year
is
it
increasing
in
popular
favor
as
one
of
the
most
attractive
features
of
the

every
manager
of

should
realize
the
important
fact
that
however
strong
his
team
may
be
in
its
battery
department
or
in
the
excellence
of
the
field
support
given

it

lacking
in
one
essential
element
of
strength
if
it
be
not
up
to
the
mark
in
base
stealing
by
its
players
effective
pitching
and
sharp
fielding
are
of
course
very
necessary
to
success
in
winning
games
as
also
skilful
batting
especially
of
the
strategic
kind
while
it
is
a
difficult
task
to
get
to
first
base
safely
in
the
face
of
a
steady
and
effective
fire
from
the
opposing
battery
backed
up
by
good
support
from
the
field
it
is
still
more
difficult
when
the
first
base
is
safely
reached
to
secure
the
other
bases
by
good
base
stealing
the
fact
is
a
greater
degree
of
intelligence
is
required
in
the
player
who
would
excel
in
base
running
than
is
needed
either
in
fielding
or
in
batting
any
can
occasionally
hit
a
ball
for
a
home
run
but
it
requires
a
shrewd
intelligent
player
with
his
wits
about
him
to
make
a
successful
base
runner
indeed
base
running
is
the
most
difficult
work
a
player
has
to
do
in
the
game
to
cover
infield
positions
properly
a
degree
of
intelligence
in
the
player
is
required
which
the
majority
do
not
as
a
general
rule
possess
but
to
excel
in
base
running
such
mental
qualifications
are
required
as
only
a
small
minority
are
found
to
possess
presence
of
mind
prompt
action
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
quickness
of
perception
and
coolness
and
nerve
are
among
the
requisites
of
a
successful
base
runner
players
habitually
accustomed
to
hesitate
to
do
this
that
or
the
other
in
attending
to
the
varied
points
of
a
game
can
never
become

there
is
so
little
time
allowed
to
judge
of
the
situation
that
prompt
action
becomes
a
necessity
with
the
base
runner
he
must
hurry
up
all
the
time
then
too
he
must
be
daring
in
taking
risks
while
at
the
same
time
avoiding
recklessness
in
his
running
due
consideration
had
not
been
given
by
the
league
magnates
up
to
to
the
importance
of
having
more
definite
rules
governing
the
base
running
in
the
game
the
rules
applicable
to
balks
in
pitching
as
affecting
the
base
running
having
been
at
no
time
as
clear
and
definite
as
they
should
be
nor
have
the
existing
rules
bearing
upon
base
running
been
strictly
observed
by
the
majority
of
the
umpires
each
year
especially
was
this
the
case
in
when
the
observance
of
the
balk
rule
was
very
lax
indeed
the
difficulty
in
framing
a
proper
rule
for
the
purpose
is
to
properly
define
the
difference
between
a
palpable
error
which
enables
a
base
to
be
run
on
the
error
and
an
error
plainly
induced
by
the
very
effort
made
to
steal
a
base
no
base
can
be
credited
to
a
base
runner
as
having
been
stolen
which
is
the
result
of
a
dropped
fly
ball
a
wild
throw
to
a
base
player
or
a
palpable
muff
in
fielding
a
batted
ball
but
in
view
of
the
difficulties
surrounding
base
stealing
it
is
not
going
out
of
the
way
to
credit
a
base
as
stolen
when
the
effort
of
the
runner
in
taking
ground
and
getting
a
start
to
steal
leads
to
a
passed
ball
a
failure
to
throw
to
a
base
quick
enough
or
a
failure
on
the
part
of
a
base
player
to
put
the
ball
on
the
runner
quick
enough
of
course
these
are
to
a
certain
extent
errors
on
the
part
of
the
fielders
but
they
are
not
of
the
class
of
as
wild
throws
dropped
fly
balls
and
failures
to
pick
up
batted
balls
or
to
hold
well
thrown
balls
are
the
other
errors
are
consequent
upon
the
effort
on
the
part
of
the
runner
to
steal
a
base
and
as
such
should
be
included
as
part
and
parcel
of

base

the
fielding
of
season
after
season
finds
the
fielding
in
base
ball
better
attended
to
than
any
other
department
of
the
game
and
it
is
fortunate
for
the
business
end
of
professional
ball
playing
that
it
is
so
as
skilful
fielding
is
decidedly
the
most
attractive
feature
of
our
national
game
next
to
fielding
comes
base
running
and
lastly
batting
the
reason
that
so
much
more
skill
is
shown
in
the
fielding
department
than
in
that
of
batting
is
due
to
the
fact
that
more
attention
is
giving
to
fielding
than
to
batting
regular
training
in
batting
is
practically
unknown
in
the
professional
arena
while
practice
in
fielding
is
given
every
attention
no
game
is
played
without
an
hour
being
devoted
to
preliminary
practice
in
fielding
while
efficient
batting
is
unknown
except
in
the
college
arena
the
professionals
ignoring
batting
practice
in
nearly
every
club
hence
the
superiority
fielding
has
attained
over
the
batting
go
on
any
amateur
field
and
watch
a
game
in
progress
and
you
can
readily
see
the
inferiority
in
fielding
exhibited
in
comparison
with
that
shown
on
the
professional
fields
it
is
not
so
in
the
batting
however
the
reason
is
that
amateurs
have
not
the
time
to
devote
to
the
practice
required
to
excel
in
fielding
but
they
can
bat
out
and
as
easily
as
the
record
batsmen
do
in
the
professional
fields
it
is
different
however
in
the
case
of
doing
at
the
bat
owing
to
their
not
having
time
for
the
necessary
practice
some
splendid
fielding
was
done
in
but
as
a
whole
it
was
not
superior
to
that
of
or
even
to
that
of
one
reason
for
this
was
the
introduction
of
the
catcher
big
mitt
in
the
infield
work
something
that
should
not
have
been
allowed
it
was
due
to
this
fact
that
the
batting
scores
were
not
larger
the
past
season
than
they
were
in
the
big
mitt
on
the
hands
of
infielders
enabling
them
to
stop
hard
hit
bounders
and
daisy
cutters
which
but
for
the
use
of
the
mitts
would
have
been
clean
earned
base
hits
this
gave
the
infielders
an
opportunity
to
materially
lessen
the
base
hit
record
by
a
mistaken
calculation
the
pitchers
were
charged
with
doing
less
effective
work
single
figure
games
being
in
a
majority
last
season
in
contrast
to
the
attractions
of
fine
fielding
the
average
batting
of
the
period
is
decidedly
behindhand
what
sight
on
a
ball
field
is
prettier
to
the
good
judge
of
the
fine
points
of
the
game
than
to
see
a
hard
hit
bounder
well
stopped
and
accurately
thrown
from
back
of
third
base
over
to
first
base
in
time
to
cut
off
a
rapid
runner
or
to
see
a
splendidly
judged
fly
ball
held
after
a
long
run
or
a
hot
liner
caught
on
the
jump
by
an
infielder
or
a
beautiful
triple
play
made
from
the
infield
or
a
good
double
play
from
a
neat
catch
followed
by
a
fine
long
from
the
outfield
all
these
attractive
features
of
sharp
fielding
all
can
enjoy
and
appreciate
but
in
the
batting
department
too
little
at
the
bat
that
is
skilful
scientific
handling
of
the
bat
in
the
form
of
hitting
to
forward
runners
is
done
to
gratify
good
judges
the
mere
novices
regarding
hits
for
a
home
run
as
the
very
acme
of
splendid
batting
though
they
are
invariably
chance
hits
and
only
made
off
poor
pitching
as
a
rule
then
too
how
the
groundlings
as
hamlet
called
them
enjoy
fungo
hitting
that
is
high
balls
hit
in
the
air
flying
to
the
outfield
this
style
of
hitting
giving
fifty
chances
for
catches
to
every
single
home
run
time
and
again
will
one
hear
a
bleacher
remark
i
do
care
if
the
ball
was
caught
it
was
a
good
hit
as
if
any
hit
could
be
a
good
one
which
gave
an
easy
chance
for
a
catch
when
a
fungo
hitter
takes
his
bat
in
hand
all
he
thinks
of
is
to
line
out
tommy
in
response
to
the
calls
from
the
bleaching
boards
and
when
the
ball
goes
up
in
the
air
to
outfield
a
shout
bursts
forth
from
the
crowd
only
to
be
suddenly
stopped
as
the
ball
is
easily
caught
at
deep
outfield
by
an
outfielder
placed
there
purposely
for
the
catch
by
the
pitcher
skilful
pitching
for
catches
contrast
this
method
of
batting
to
that
of
place
hitting
which
yields
a
safe
tap
to
short
outfield
ensuring
an
earned
base
or
the
skilful
bunt
hit
made
at
a
time
when
the
fielders
are
expecting
a
hit
or
a
sacrifice
hit
following
a
good
effort
for
a
base
hit
to
right
field
which
should
mark
all
attempts
to
forward
runners
especially
when
on
third
base
of
course
there
are
skilful
outfield
hits
made
in
but
they
are
confined
to
hot
low
liners
giving
no
chance
for
a
catch
or
hard
hit
daisy
cutters
which
yield
two
or
three
bases
but
every
ball
hit
in
the
air
to
outfield
shows
weak
batting
and
this
style
of
hitting
it
is
which
gives
so
many
chances
for
catches
in
a
game
it
will
be
readily
seen
how
inferior
the
style
of
batting
is
to
at
the
bat
and
how
much
more
attractive
fielding
is
in
contrast
to
the
popular
fungo
hitting
method
of
which
there
was
altogether
too
much
in
the
league
ranks
last
season
to
make
the
batting
compare
with
the
fielding
as
an
attractive
feature
of
the
game
single
figure
games
there
is
a
great
difference
between
single
figure
games
marked
by
batting
against
skilful
strategic
pitching
backed
up
by
splendid
in
and
outfield
support
and
the
class
of
contests
known
as
pitchers
games
the
former
are
contests
in
which
runners
reaching
second
and
even
third
base
by
good
hits
are
cut
off
from
scoring
runs
by
superior
pitching
and
fielding
and
this
class
of
games
comprises
the
model
contests
of
each
season
on
the
other
hand
the
pitchers
games
which
yield
single
figure
scores
are
tedious
and
wearisome
to
the
best
judges
of
the
game
from
the
fact
that
the
brunt
of
the
work
falls
on
the
battery
team
and
one
or
two
infielders
all
the
attractions
of
base
running
and
of
sharp
fielding
being
sacrificed
at
the
cost
of
seeing
batsman
after
batsman
retired
on
called
strikes
arising
from
the
intimidating
speed
of
the
pitching
this
requiring
the
batsman
to
devote
his
whole
energies
to
defending
himself
from
the
severe
and
often
fatal
injuries
following
his
being
hit
by
the
pitched
ball
fortunately
the
change
in
the
distance
between
the
pitcher
and
batsman
has
decreased
the
opportunity
for
this
class
of
unattractive
games
but
it
will
not
do
to
go
over
to
the
other
side
and
by
too
much
weakening
of
the
box
work
give
the
class
of
fungo
hitters
a
chance
to
revel
in
hits
and
give
the
batsman
undue
preponderance
in
the
effort
to
equalize
the
powers
of
the
attack
and
defense
in
the
game
single
figure
games
should
outnumber
double
figure
contests
to
make
the
game
attractive
for
the
scientific
play
exhibited
but
not
in
the
line
of
being
the
result
of
cyclone
pitching
the
umpiring
of
the
umpiring
of
despite
of
the
new
rules
adopted
early
in
the
year
governing
the
position
was
no
improvement
over
that
of
in
fact
in
several
instances
it
was
worse
the
explicitly
worded
rule
prohibiting
umpires
from
allowing
any
player
except
the
captain
to
dispute
a
single
decision
of
the
umpire
was
allowed
to
be
openly
violated
by
nearly
every
umpire
on
the
staff
then
too
as
a
rule
they
the
majority
lacked
the
nerve
and
the
courage
of
their
convictions
too
much
to
keep
in
check
the
blackguardism
displayed
by
a
small
minority
of
the
players
of
the
league
teams
of
some
of
the
umpires
also
displayed
a
degree
of
temper
at
times
which
sadly
marred
their
judgment
that
they
all
endeavored
to
do
their
duty
impartially
goes
without
saying
but
no
umpire
is
fit
for
his
position
who
can
not
control
his
there
was
one
instance
shown
of
the
folly
of
condoning
the
offence
of
drinking
which
should
not
have
been
allowed
a
drunken
umpire
is
worse
than
a
drunken
player
for
no
one
will
respect
his
decisions
none
such
should
be
allowed
on
the
league
staff
under
any
circumstances
moreover
no
umpire
connected
with
the
business
should
be
allowed
on
the
league
staff
no
matter
what
his
ability
may
be
in
other
respects
when
it
becomes
a
necessity
to
have
to
engage
pugilists
as
umpires
to
control
hoodlum
players
then
will
professional
ball
playing
cease
to
be
worthy
of
public
patronage
one
great
drawback
to
the
successful
umpiring
which
was
expected
to
follow
the
revision
of
the
rules
made
in
march
was
the
countenancing
of
the
abuse
of
umpires
by
the
magnates
of
the
clubs
themselves
when
presidents
and
directors
of
clubs
fail
to
rebuke
the
faults
of
their
club
managers
in
allowing
incompetent
or
captains
to
set
their
players
bad
examples
in
this
respect
they
have
no
right
to
find
fault
with
the
poor
umpiring
which
follows
in
the
recent
past
the
rule
on
the
league
ball
fields
and
minor
leagues
copy
all
that
the
major
league
does
has
been
that
from
the
time
the
umpire
takes
up
his
position
behind
the
bat
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
a
game
he
finds
both
the
contesting
teams
regarding
him
as
a
common
enemy
the
losing
side
invariably
blaming
him
as
the
primary
cause
of
their
losing
the
game
then
too
in
addition
to
the
contesting
teams
as
his
foes
there
are
the
majority
of
the
crowd
of
spectators
to
be
added
to
the
list
the
rougher
element
of
the
assemblage
the
latter
of
whom
regard
the
umpire
as
an
especial
target
for
abuse
in
every
instance
in
which
the
home
team
is
defeated
last
on
the
list
of
the
umpire
opponents
are
the
betting
class
of
reporters
who
take
delight
in
pitching
into
him
whenever
his
decisions
no
matter
how
impartially
he
acts
go
against
their
pet
club
or
the
one
they
bet
on
it
is
a
fact
not
to
be
disputed
that
those
of
the
crowd
of
spectators
at
a
ball
game
who
are
so
ready
to
condemn
umpires
for
alleged
partiality
in
their
work
or
for
a
supposed
lack
of
judgment
in
rendering
their
decisions
never
give
a
moment
thought
to
the
difficulties
of
the
position
he
occupies
or
to
the
arduous
nature
of
the
work
he
is
called
upon
to
perform
there
he
stands
close
behind
the
catcher
and
batsman
where
he
is
required
to
judge
whether
the
ball
from
the
pitcher
with
its
erratic
curves
and
shoots
darts
in
over
the
home
base
or
within
the
legal
range
of
the
bat
the
startling
fact
is
never
considered
that
several
umpires
have
been
killed
outright
while
occupying
this
dangerous
position
neither
does
any
one
reflect
for
a
moment
that
the
umpire
occupies
this
perilous
position
while
regarded
as
a
common
enemy
by
both
of
the
contesting
teams
and
as
a
legitimate
object
for
insulting
abuse
from
the
partisan
portion
of
the
crowd
of
spectators
in
fact
the
umpire
stands
there
as
the
one
defenseless
man
against
thousands
of
pitiless
foes
the
wonder
is
that
half
the
umpires
in
the
arena
are
as
successful
in
the
discharge
of
their
arduous
duties
as
they
are
and
the
still
greater
wonder
is
that
any
man
can
be
induced
to
occupy
a
position
which
is
becoming
year
after
year
more
objectionable
there
can
be
no
successful
umpiring
accomplished
in
the
position
no
matter
how
perfect
the
code
of
rules
governing
the
umpiring
may
apparently
be
as
long
as
that
nuisance
of
the
ball
field
the
professional
kicker
is
allowed
to
have
his
way
in
view
of
the
express
rules
which
are
in
the
code
prohibiting
the
disputing
of
a
single
decision
made
by
the
umpire
it
is
astonishing
that
the
umpires
themselves
not
to
mention
club
managers
and
field
captains
are
so
derelict
in
their
duty
in
not
enforcing
the
letter
of
the
law
of
the
code
in
this
respect
let
the
magnates
remember
when
they
say
to
each
other
this
year
as
they
did
at
the
close
of
the
season
of
that
this
hoodlumism
in
professional
ball
playing
must
be
stopped
that
is
themselves
who
are
to
for
the
blackguardism
exhibited
in
the
league
arena
in
it
is
the
failure
of
presidents
and
directors
of
league
clubs
to
do
their
duty
which
is
the
real
cause
of
such
umpiring
as
we
had
in
club
managers
of
teams
as
a
rule
do
what
they
know
the
club
presidents
or
directors
quietly
approve
of
or
countenance
hence
the
latitude
given
to
the
hoodlum
tactics
of
the
rough
element
in
each
team
do
blame
umpires
from
meekly
following
the
example
club
presidents
and
directors
afford
their
team
managers
and
captains
editorial
comments
on
the
occurrences
events
and
noteworthy
incidents
of
in
the
base
ball
arena
here
is
a
list
of
the
rules
governing
the
movements
of
the
pitcher
in
delivering
the
ball
to
the
bat
which
we
saw
violated
repeatedly
during
without
any
protests
from
any
of
the
umpires
who
acted
in
the
games
we
reported
first
not
a
pitcher
had
his
foot
in
contact
with
the
rubber
plate
last
season
all
of
them
invariably
placing
their
back
foot
a
few
inches
in
front
of
the
plate
not
one
pitcher
in
ten
after
feigning
to
throw
to
a
base
resumed
his
position
as
required
by
the
rule
after
making
the
feint
not
one
in
ten
held
the
ball
firmly
in
front
of
his
body
as
the
rule
requires
not
one
in
ten
faced
the
batsman
as
required
by
rule
as
for
the
balk
rule
it
was
as
openly
violated
last
season
almost
as
it
was
in
time
and
again
was
section
rule
violated
as
was
section
all
the
time
as
not
one
had
his
foot
in
position
as
the
rule
requires
and
yet
not
an
umpire
fined
a
single
pitcher
for
the
violation
of
the
rules
in
question
that
we
saw
what
the
pitching
rules
should
be
made
to
foster
is
first
command
of
the
with
the
consequent
accuracy
of
aim
in
delivery
secondly
the
substitution
of
in
delivery
in
the
place
of
mere
intimidating
speed
thirdly
the
avoidance
of
the
wear
and
tear
of
an
extremely
swift
delivery
of
the
ball
fourthly
the
prevention
of
obstacles
to
successful
base
running
in
the
way
of
allowing
too
many
balk
movements
in
preventing
stolen
bases
these
desirable
objects
were
almost
impossible
of
attainment
under
the
rules
in
existence
in
in
regard
to
the
wearing
of
the
catcher
big
mitt
by
infielders
in
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
that
utility
man
of
the
philadelphia
team
lave
cross
while
wearing
a
catcher
mitt
as
third
baseman
a
large
one
at
that
too
used
it
to
such
advantage
that
it
was
next
to
impossible
for
a
ball
hit
to
his
position
to
get
by
him
at
times
it
was
simply
laughable
to
see
him
stop
ground
hits
to
wear
such
gloves
is
making
a
travesty
of
skilful
infield
work
in
stopping
hard
hit
bounding
or
ground
balls
but
with
the
speedy
batting
of
the
hard
ball
now
in
use
the
stopping
of
hard
hit
balls
in
the
infield
becomes
dangerous
to
the
fingers
without
the
aid
of
small
gloves
but
no
such
glove
as
the
catcher
mitt
should
be
allowed
to
be
used
save
by
the
catchers
or
first
basemen
in
this
position
the
mitt
in
question
is
a
necessity
in
view
of
the
great
speed
of
the
pitcher
delivery
and
the
extremely
wild
swift
throwing
from
the
field
positions
to
first
base
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
in
the
days
when
gloves
were
not
worn
when
the
pitching
was
far
less
swift
than
now
even
then
broken
and
split
fingers
marked
nearly
every
contest
and
behind
the
bat
four
catchers
were
needed
where
one
or
two
will
now
suffice
a
washington
scribe
in
commenting
on
manager
schmelz
work
in
said
schmelz
is
a
base
ball
man
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
we
have
been
taught
to
believe
here
that
when
he
says
he
will
do
a
thing
he
comes
pretty
near
fulfilling
his
prediction
if
the
team
gets
a
fairly
good
start
at
the
beginning
of
this
season
he
is
just
as
like
as
not
to
let
several
teams
chase
him
under
the
wire
in
september
next
a
lack
of
and
a
most
deplorable
weakness
at
short
second
and
third
throughout
the
past
season
lost
the
team
many
a
game
to
this
latter
list
may
be
added
incompetent
captaining
of
the
team
by
the
noted
kicker
joyce
the
boston
correspondent
of
the
louis
sporting
news
in
one
of
his
letters
of
last
winter
sent
the
following
interesting
account
of
an
interview
had
between
manager
selee
of
the
bostons
and
a
business
man
he
met
on
a
train
last
october
the
asked
the
manager
whether
as
a
class
were
a
disreputable
set
of
men
who
made
a
practice
of
spending
their
money
foolishly
and
of
saying
and
doing
things
on
the
ball
field
that
were
decidedly
objectionable
also
if
in
consequence
the
interest
in
the
game
had
not
to
a
very
large
degree
been
on
the
wane
for
a
number
of
years
past
he
said
he
had
read
in
the
papers
of
a
number
of
acts
that
had
led
him
to
believe
that
such
was
the
case
and
that
while
formerly
he
had
been
an
attendant
at
the
games
that
latterly
he
had
lost
his
desire
in
that
respect
though
he
still
had
an
interest
in
all
that
is
published
about
the
game
and
the
selee
at
once
attempted
to
show
the
gentleman
where
his
opinion
was
at
fault
and
an
interesting
conversation
was
carried
on
until
the
train
reached
boston
the
gentleman
severely
criticising
the
players
and
the
boston
manager
defending
them
the
correspondent
in
commenting
on
this
wrote
as
follows
this
incident
opens
anew
a
topic
that
has
created
considerable
discussion
for
several
years
and
which
was
brought
most
forcibly
to
the
public
eye
by
a
number
of
cases
that
occurred
during
the
season
of
namely
has
the
rough
rowdy
disreputable
hoodlum
element
increased
or
decreased
in
the
professional
arena
in
the
past
five
or
ten
years
further
on
he
adds
any
intelligent
unprejudiced
student
of
the
game
can
not
but
reach
the
conclusion
that
in
recent
years
the
excessive
drinkers
the
talkers
in
short
the
worst
element
in
the
professional
ranks
has
been
gradually
weeded
out
until
the
evil
has
been
reduced
to
almost
a
minimum
while
the
intelligence
manliness
and
exemplary
habits
of
the
players
have
increased
correspondingly
where
even
five
years
ago
a
ball
team
could
be
found
where
a
majority
of
its
players
were
of
the
drinking
gambling
disreputable
class
can
be
seen
the
results
of
a
great
and
gratifying
reform
in
the
personnel
of
the
teams
brought
about
largely
by
the
efforts
of
the
management
who
have
had
their
eyes
opened
to
the
trend
of
public
opinion
and
have
gradually
gotten
rid
of
this
unpopular
element
and
secured
in
their
places
players
of
a
far
different
plane
of
morals
judging
from
reports
of
contests
in
the
league
arena
in
the
reformation
above
referred
to
has
been
far
too
slow
in
its
progress
for
the
good
of
the
game
witness
the
novelty
in
league
annals
of
men
fighting
each
other
or
striking
umpires
on
the
field
the
use
of
vile
language
in
abuse
of
umpires
and
the
many
instances
of
dirty
ball
playing
recorded
against
the
majority
of
the
league
club
teams
of
the
past
season
the
time
was
says
the
same
writer
when
a
ball
player
skill
was
the
primary
recommendation
for
an
engagement
his
moral
qualifications
being
of
a
secondary
consideration
however
while
playing
skill
is
of
course
one
of
the
leading
qualities
that
an
applicant
for
honors
on
the
diamond
field
must
possess
it
does
not
fill
the
whole
bill
by
any
means
his
habits
his
influence
among
his
fellow
players
his
general
reputation
with
the
public
are
also
taken
into
consideration
more
than
before
and
if
he
can
pass
muster
in
all
these
respects
he
is
eligible
for
engagement
in
all
well
managed
teams
in
commenting
on
the
existing
situation
of
the
professional
branch
of
our
grand
national
game
wm
bell
the
kansas
correspondent
of
the
louis
sporting
news
says
the
growth
and
development
of
our
national
game
as
been
wonderful
its
success
has
been
unparalleled
in
the
world
history
of
athletic
sports
and
stands
a
living
monument
to
the
courage
energy
and
perseverance
of
the
american
people
when
we
pause
a
moment
in
our
contemplation
of
the
brilliant
future
of
our
game
and
turn
a
glance
back
over
the
past
and
try
to
realize
that
less
than
one
generation
has
lived
since
the
birth
of
base
ball
and
our
fathers
guided
its
first
feeble
steps
even
we
americans
familiar
with
progress
unequaled
in
the
history
of
the
world
are
forced
to
marvel
at
the
rapid
growth
of
this
athletic
sport
further
on
on
the
same
topic
bell
says
very
truly
while
base
ball
has
advanced
with
great
strides
its
growth
has
been
normal
and
healthy
its
success
is
not
the
result
of
a
boom
giving
it
a
fictitious
value
its
prosperity
is
not
as
an
inflated
balloon
that
will
collapse
when
torn
by
the
knife
of
adversity
it
is
but
a
creation
of
man
and
while
its
life
has
been
one
of
unequaled
prosperity
it
has
suffered
as
do
all
things
of
this
earth
one
factor
has
ever
been
potent
in
its
success
and
that
is
honesty
the
honesty
of
the
game
has
always
been
its
motto
and
though
often
assailed
has
still
remained
intact
this
alone
has
gained
for
baseball
a
foothold
in
the
hearts
of
the
american
people
that
nothing
can
dislodge
americans
are
known
the
world
over
as
lovers
of
fair
and
honest
sport
and
to
base
ball
they
have
given
their
unswerving
allegiance
here
is
a
merited
compliment
to
the
national
league
from
the
same
able
pen
our
national
game
was
never
so
firmly
established
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
as
at
the
present
time
it
is
safe
in
the
hands
of
true
and
tried
men
who
are
devoting
their
lives
to
its
success
it
is
dominated
and
controlled
by
that
grand
old
organization
the
national
league
which
for
twenty
years
has
been
the
great
exponent
of
the
game
and
has
done
more
to
advance
the
game
than
any
other
factor
the
league
has
during
its
life
stood
on
one
platform
honesty
and
purity
in
base
ball
and
has
always
retained
the
confidence
and
respect
of
the
people
it
has
elevated
the
game
until
base
ball
stands
on
a
firm
foundation
of
popular
approval
unequaled
by
any
other
athletic
sport
while
the
game
has
advanced
with
marvelous
rapidity
it
has
experienced
short
periods
of
depression
and
stagnation
during
its
career
of
thirty
years
it
has
had
enemies
who
have
sought
to
pervert
it
for
their
own
uses
it
has
been
all
but
torn
asunder
by
civil
war
but
each
time
it
has
bravely
met
the
issue
and
in
the
end
triumphed
it
is
just
now
recovering
from
the
effects
of
a
civil
war
which
all
but
destroyed
it
the
rapidity
with
which
it
has
recovered
has
been
wonderful
and
is
to
me
a
greater
proof
of
prosperity
and
success
than
any
success
that
could
come
to
it
while
enjoying
a
long
period
of
peace
we
regret
not
having
space
to
quote
more
at
length
from
bell
very
able
article
published
in
the
sporting
news
of
january
last
the
following
paragraph
published
in
the
new
york
clipper
of
february
tells
a
quiet
little
story
well
worthy
of
record
in
the
guide
spalding
of
the
chicago
club
was
asked
how
so
much
stock
of
the
new
york
club
came
to
be
owned
by
outside
parties
and
he
said
i
will
tell
you
during
the
troublous
brotherhood
times
of
along
in
july
i
think
i
was
suddenly
summoned
to
new
york
i
went
direct
to
abell
house
by
request
entirely
oblivious
of
the
object
of
the
sudden
call
and
there
met
soden
of
boston
reach
of
philadelphia
byrne
of
brooklyn
brush
of
indianapolis
and
one
or
two
others
there
we
received
the
pleasant
information
from
john
b
day
that
the
new
york
club
was
financially
at
the
end
of
its
rope
and
must
have
immediate
assistance
imagine
our
surprise
when
we
were
told
that
the
club
must
have
at
once
to
carry
it
through
the
season
or
the
new
york
club
must
give
up
its
end
of
the
fight
when
we
had
collected
our
senses
sufficiently
to
speak
it
was
the
general
opinion
that
if
the
new
york
club
failed
at
that
stage
of
the
game
the
fight
with
the
brotherhood
was
lost
and
the
future
of
the
old
national
league
was
to
say
the
least
uncertain
so
it
was
finally
decided
that
we
must
save
the
new
york
club
at
all
hazards
and
before
we
separated
that
night
i
agreed
to
provide
soden
and
brush
came
forward
with
similar
amounts
and
the
balance
was
taken
by
reach
abell
and
one
or
two
others
as
i
remember
it
was
pretty
costly
but
that
prompt
act
saved
the
national
league
and
by
saving
it
the
future
of
professional
base
ball
in
this
country
was
in
my
opinion
also
saved
this
will
explain
how
i
first
became
interested
in
the
new
york
club
and
as
a
result
find
myself
criticised
for
ever
being
permitted
to
hold
any
of
the
stock
of
this
stock
alloted
to
chicago
anson
took
and
paid
cash
for
another
chicago
gentleman
took
my
brother
walter
and
myself
afterward
i
sold
or
practically
gave
my
stock
to
my
brother
and
i
think
he
picked
up
some
more
while
he
was
a
director
of
the
club
that
brotherhood
fight
was
a
great
fight
and
one
that
will
probably
never
be
duplicated
the
real
inside
history
of
that
struggle
and
its
final
settlement
was
never
written
but
if
it
ever
is
it
will
prove
quite
interesting
as
well
as
quite
a
surprise
to
the
base
ball
men
of
that
day
but
why
talk
in
this
strain
any
longer
you
know
i
am
out
of
active
base
ball
and
these
reminiscences
simply
emphasize
the
fact
that
i
ought
to
be
out
of
it
for
i
am
getting
too
old
what
a
commentary
on
the
selfish
greed
of
the
overpaid
star
players
of
the
class
of
the
professional
fraternity
spalding
account
of
one
costly
result
of
the
players
revolt
of
the
above
story
presents
it
also
tells
the
true
story
of
how
the
magnates
of
the
boston
chicago
philadelphia
brooklyn
and
indianapolis
clubs
of
came
to
be
financially
interested
in
the
new
york
club
not
for
profit
but
to
save
the
disruption
of
the
league
the
veteran
comiskey
thus
explains
the
difference
in
one
special
respect
between
a
seasoned
player
and
a
and
he
is
one
who
ought
to
know
you
know
he
said
in
an
interview
no
one
appreciates
the
superiority
of
hustling
aggressive
youngsters
over
the
old
standbys
of
the
diamond
more
than
i
do
a
seasoned
player
as
a
rule
develops
into
a
mechanical
player
who
is
always
watching
his
averages
and
keeping
tab
on
himself
while
he
may
be
too
loyal
to
shirk
he
will
not
take
a
chance
which
he
is
not
compelled
to
especially
is
this
true
in
running
bases
how
many
of
these
old
players
will
slide
or
go
into
a
bag
when
they
are
blocked
off
very
few
on
the
other
hand
a
young
player
appreciates
that
he
has
to
make
a
reputation
while
the
old
player
who
has
one
to
protect
is
in
the
business
for
a
livelihood
and
nothing
else
popular
applause
has
lost
its
favor
for
him
and
while
it
is
not
unwelcome
it
does
not
stimulate
him
to
renewed
exertions
as
it
did
when
he
began
his
career
it
is
entirely
different
with
the
man
who
is
trying
to
establish
himself
in
the
major
league
an
ambitious
young
player
thinks
that
the
game
depends
upon
him
and
is
dead
sure
that
every
crank
agrees
with
him
give
him
a
good
in
the
papers
or
let
his
manager
commend
him
for
a
creditable
piece
of
work
and
he
will
break
his
neck
in
his
efforts
to
deserve
another
installment
the
public
demands
snappy
ball
and
the
young
players
are
the
only
ones
who
can
serve
up
that
article
in
his
remarks
comiskey
furthermore
said
the
good
effect
of
a
manager
or
captain
praise
of
a
is
surprising
both
of
these
officials
of
the
league
clubs
almost
without
exception
are
apt
to
be
silent
as
the
grave
when
a
player
makes
a
good
point
or
a
fine
stop
or
catch
but
the
moment
he
fails
to
make
an
almost
impossible
play
then
comes
the
snarl
or
the
rutty
growl
harry
wright
stands
out
alone
as
the
only
manager
or
captain
to
encourage
a
player
with
praise
a
philadelphia
scribe
in
commenting
on
the
rowdy
ball
playing
of
in
the
league
ranks
says
we
could
fill
pages
with
evidence
of
the
rowdyism
indulged
in
by
the
majority
of
the
league
teams
during
the
season
of
and
that
too
if
we
were
only
to
confine
ourselves
to
the
local
reports
of
the
season
at
cleveland
pittsburgh
philadelphia
baltimore
and
half
a
dozen
other
cities
as
the
cleveland
leader
had
it
in
commenting
upon
one
of
the
games
i
say
it
with
reluctance
for
i
have
always
admired
ned
pluck
that
the
national
game
never
received
so
severe
a
as
it
did
during
the
last
baltimore
series
here
the
effort
to
spike
players
the
constant
flow
of
profanity
and
vulgarity
the
incessant
and
idiotic
abuse
of
an
umpire
all
combined
to
make
the
baltimore
club
that
local
people
have
been
led
to
believe
was
made
of
a
crowd
of
earnest
honest
players
thoroughly
despised
and
detested
in
ten
years
experience
in
scoring
games
in
cleveland
i
have
never
heard
such
a
torrent
of
vulgarity
profanity
and
brutal
senseless
abuse
heaped
upon
an
umpire
as
lynch
stood
from
the
baltimore
players
upon
the
field
here
similar
charges
against
visiting
teams
were
made
by
the
pittsburgh
people
against
the
cleveland
team
by
the
philadelphia
scribes
against
the
bostons
etc
in
fact
proof
and
plenty
of
it
was
easily
attainable
from
the
reports
from
every
league
city
during
to
a
more
or
less
extent
the
question
apropos
to
this
comment
is
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
in
magnates
john
rowe
the
veteran
player
who
was
one
of
the
big
four
transferred
from
the
buffalo
club
to
the
detroit
club
in
the
fall
of
is
a
firm
believer
in
southern
trips
during
the
preliminary
season
to
get
the
players
in
condition
for
a
championship
season
in
speaking
on
that
subject
he
said
the
year
the
detroits
won
the
national
league
pennant
we
went
south
and
before
the
regular
season
opened
that
team
had
played
over
games
in
consequence
we
were
in
the
acme
of
condition
and
some
of
the
teams
nearly
lost
their
breath
when
they
tackled
us
for
the
first
time
the
men
could
hit
like
fiends
and
field
fast
and
perfect
there
were
no
cases
of
horse
in
our
team
and
as
for
arms
they
were
not
included
in
our
outfit
it
is
a
great
thing
i
tell
you
and
the
managers
who
take
their
men
into
a
warm
climate
are
doing
a
sensible
act
according
to
my
idea
the
plan
is
to
first
practice
until
the
players
become
limbered
up
say
for
a
week
or
so
before
attempting
to
play
a
game
then
get
in
as
many
games
as
possible
without
overdoing
it
until
the
regular
schedule
begins
in
the
exhibition
games
the
experiments
can
be
tried
out
and
the
men
will
gradually
learn
to
play
together
which
means
much
to
a
club
of
course
there
is
more
or
less
luck
in
base
ball
but
at
the
same
time
luck
ca
win
alone
all
the
time
and
an
agreeable
manager
count
a
long
ways
toward
winning
a
pennant
we
would
add
to
the
last
line
that
the
absence
of
drinking
and
hoodlumism
in
the
ranks
is
equally
a
necessity
in
the
arena
of
minor
leagues
in
professional
baseball
outside
of
the
sectional
leagues
like
those
of
the
western
eastern
southern
new
england
and
other
like
leagues
there
is
no
class
of
minor
leagues
which
is
so
much
fostered
as
individual
state
leagues
trio
or
duo
state
leagues
should
be
avoided
except
in
very
exceptional
cases
in
the
organization
of
the
various
minor
leagues
in
existence
one
special
point
has
been
too
much
neglected
and
that
is
the
importance
of
making
the
league
pennant
race
specially
attractive
by
the
attractive
character
of
the
honors
to
be
won
sectional
leagues
made
up
of
circuits
present
as
good
attractions
in
their
championship
honors
at
stake
as
that
of
the
great
major
league
and
next
to
these
come
the
pennant
races
of
state
leagues
but
what
special
object
in
this
respect
is
there
to
strike
for
in
the
championships
of
trio
or
duo
state
leagues
none
whatever
they
are
mere
organizations
lacking
all
of
the
attractive
features
of
sectional
and
state
league
pennant
races
state
leagues
also
possess
the
advantage
of
not
interfering
with
the
interests
of
the
sectional
leagues
which
include
state
clubs
take
any
state
in
which
professional
base
ball
flourishes
and
in
the
state
there
will
be
found
two
classes
of
professional
clubs
the
one
strong
class
which
exist
in
the
larger
cities
of
the
state
and
the
weaker
class
which
represents
the
smaller
towns
the
sectional
leagues
of
course
seek
to
attach
the
former
to
their
circuits
leaving
the
latter
eligible
for
state
league
circuits
for
many
years
past
columns
of
space
in
papers
making
base
ball
a
specialty
have
been
occupied
with
long
arrays
of
figures
giving
the
averages
of
the
players
in
the
batting
and
fielding
departments
of
the
game
to
such
an
extent
has
this
feature
of
the
annual
statistics
of
the
game
been
carried
that
the
records
based
upon
these
averages
have
come
to
be
regarded
by
the
players
as
the
primary
object
in
view
during
each
season
work
in
the
field
as
a
result
of
this
system
those
club
directors
and
managers
who
have
never
fully
examined
into
the
merits
of
the
subject
and
who
are
not
therefore
aware
of
the
fact
that
as
criterions
of
the
most
skilful
play
in
each
department
these
averages
are
comparatively
useless
have
been
led
into
the
costly
error
of
making
their
selections
for
their
teams
each
season
upon
the
basis
of
the
figures
of
the
players
averages
and
hence
the
customary
announcement
made
at
the
beginning
of
each
season
that
our
team
has
the
best
batting
average
of
the
season
it
is
about
time
that
the
fallacy
of
this
average
business
should
be
shown
up
in
its
true
light
and
that
the
existing
system
of
making
out
averages
should
be
so
changed
as
to
make
it
some
sort
of
a
test
of
a
player
skill
in
his
home
position
which
it
certainly
is
not
now
the
worst
of
this
average
business
as
it
prevails
now
is
that
it
is
a
powerful
incentive
for
every
player
to
make
playing
for
a
record
his
principal
object
in
his
season
work
and
that
duty
playing
for
the
side
a
matter
of
secondary
consideration
the
cranks
title
of
giants
given
years
ago
to
the
new
york
team
has
become
a
misnomer
the
team
most
entitled
to
it
in
was
that
of
the
chicago
club
no
other
club
team
making
such
a
show
of
heavyweight
players
last
season
as
did
anson
real
giants

will
be
seen

here
is
something
worthy
of
note
by
club
managers
who
begin
to
get
their
teams
together
each
spring
which
we
clipped
from
the
louis
sporting
news
of
last
december
the
editor
of
the
news
said
the
player
that
is
on
the
upward
path
is
the
man
for
success
he
is
playing
for
something
far
more
than
the
salary
he
gets
he
is
looking
forward
to
a
place
in
the
foremost
ranks
of
the
nation
ball
players
consequently
he
proves
to
be
a
hard
worker
at
all
times
he
tries
to
land
his
club
in
the
top
notch
and
his
record
for
the
part
he
took
stands
out
as
a
recommendation
to
all
the
world
on
the
other
hand
the
older
player
who
has
made
his
record
and
is
going
down
again
has
lost
all
his
ambition
he
can
put
no
life
into
the
club
his
ginger
has
been
expended
in
the
days
gone
by
and
the
people
look
upon
him
as
a
back
number
he
sticks
to
the
profession
generally
for
a
livelihood
he
wants
to
play
so
as
to
hold
his
place
but
he
has
lost
the
powers
that
he
once
had
and
can
not
do
what
he
would
like
to
accomplish
the
had
better
get
a
hump
on
themselves
this
year
else
will
the
youngsters
drive
them
out
of
the
business
the
base
ball
writer
pringle
was
right
when
he
said
it
is
useless
to
get
new
rules
until
existing
ones
have
been
rigidly
enforced
and
tested
it
is
an
undeniable
fact
that
the
umpires
of
almost
without
exception
failed
to
properly
enforce
the
rules
governing
the
umpire
duties
in
this
regard
pringle
said
the
rules
relating
to
the
duties
of
umpires
are
all
right
they
have
power
to
stop
all
rowdy
conduct
on
the
field
but
the
trouble
has
been
the
lack
of
nerve
on
the
part
of
umpires
to
enforce
the
rules
this
and
the
fact
that
the
presidents
and
directors
of
clubs
who
governed
the
managers
and
captains
of
teams
were
largely
to
blame
in
the
matter
for
not
backing
up
the
umpires
as
they
should
have
done
the
latter
have
arduous
duties
enough
to
discharge
as
it
is
without
their
finding
obstacles
in
their
way
in
the
partisan
actions
of
club
officials
who
control
club
managers
and
captains
when
this
class
supports
the
umpires
against
the
club
teams
it
will
be
time
enough
to
lay
the
whole
onus
of
hoodlumism
in
the
ranks
on
the
umpires
not
until
then
a
philadelphia
scribe
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
when
in
commenting
on
the
existing
abuses
of
kicking
and
dirty
ball
playing
in
the
league
arena
he
says
if
the
club
owners
would
take
the
initiative
in
enforcing
decorum
upon
their
players
upon
pain
of
fine
or
suspension
instead
of
shifting
the
burden
and
onus
upon
the
umpire
the
problem
of
order
at
ball
games
would
be
solved
at
once
but
the
majority
of
magnates
and
managers
while
openly
hypocritically
deploring
dirty
ball
playing
secretly
wink
at
it
and
rather
enjoy
it
especially
if
their
particular
club
secures
advantages
from
it
the
players
all
know
this
and
so
do
the
umpires
hence
the
former
presume
upon
it
while
the
latter
weaken
in
their
intent
and
desire
to
strictly
enforce
the
rules
when
the
duty
of
preserving
order
on
the
field
and
decorum
among
the
players
is
devolved
upon
the
clubs
who
represent
direct
authority
power
and
responsibility
instead
of
irresponsible
umpires
then
and
not
till
then
will
the
evils
complained
of
cease
or
at
least
be
mitigated
al
wright
the
base
ball
editor
of
the
new
york
clipper
in
its
issue
of
february
had
this
noteworthy
paragraph
in
its
columns
frank
bancroft
the
business
manager
of
the
cincinnati
club
in
speaking
about
the
equalization
of
the
players
of
the
major
league
teams
said
am
not
a
firm
believer
in
the
prevalent
practice
of
selling
the
best
men
in
a
weak
or
team
to
one
of
the
leading
clubs
and
register
a
vigorous
kick
against
it
my
plan
is
that
the
national
league
shall
pass
a
rule
forbidding
the
sale
of
a
player
from
a
club
in
the
second
division
to
a
club
in
the
first
division
i
think
this
would
in
a
measure
prevent
some
of
the
hustling
to
dispose
of
a
clever
man
for
the
sake
of
the
cash
that
is
in
the
trade
there
is
certainly
some
good
arguments
in
the
idea
and
not
one
against
it
the
clubs
of
the
second
division
have
been
too
willing
to
dispose
of
their
best
men
for
a
decent
cash
consideration
and
the
damage
that
has
been
done
to
the
game
is
incalculable
a
young
brooklyn
writer
in
commenting
on
the
threatened
war
on
the
reserve
rule
which
richter
pfeffer
buckenberger
and
barnie
were
active
in
promoting
said
since
the
national
league
and
american
association
amalgamated
at
indianapolis
in
the
league
has
not
been
a
glorious
success
the
reply
to
this
is
a
statement
of
fact
which
contradicts
the
above
assertion
very
flatly
the
reorganized
national
league
started
its
new
career
in
the
spring
of
with
an
indebtedness
resulting
from
the
base
ball
war
of
of
over
at
the
close
of
the
season
of
it
had
partially
redeemed
its
heavy
indebtedness
and
by
the
close
of
the
season
of
it
had
paid
the
debt
off
in
full
and
it
closed
the
season
of
with
a
majority
of
its
clubs
having
a
surplus
in
their
treasuries
and
that
too
despite
the
hardest
kind
of
times
of
financial
depression
if
this
is
not
a
glorious
success
pray
what
is
a
pittsburgh
scribe
in
commenting
on
the
dead
failure
of
the
scheme
to
organize
a
new
american
association
one
object
of
which
was
to
levy
war
upon
the
now
permanently
established
rule
of
the
national
agreement
clubs
very
pointedly
said
last
winter
that
such
a
scheme
would
be
folly
of
the
maddest
kind
there
is
not
a
good
reason
theoretical
or
practical
sentimental
or
otherwise
in
support
of
it
the
success
of
base
ball
to
a
very
great
extent
depends
on
public
sentiment
and
we
have
seen
what
a
base
ball
war
did
to
that
sentiment
four
years
ago
there
is
one
solid
basis
for
all
base
ball
organizations
and
that
is
the
reserve
rule
the
proposed
organization
ignores
this
fundamental
and
necessary
principle
and
consequently
can
only
be
compared
to
that
foolish
man
who
built
a
house
on
sand
during
the
decade
of
the
eighties
the
league
code
of
rules
had
this
special
clause
in
it
any
player
who
shall
be
in
any
way
interested
in
any
bet
or
wager
on
the
game
in
which
he
takes
part
either
as
a
player
umpire
or
scorer
shall
be
suspended
from
legal
service
as
a
member
of
any
professional
association
club
for
the
season
during
which
he
shall
have
violated
this
rule
the
question
is
why
was
this
important
and
rule
taken
from
the
code
no
player
can
play
ball
as
he
should
do
who
is
personally
interested
in
any
bet
on
the
content
he
is
engaged
in
that
is
a
fact
too
true
to
be
contradicted
independent
of
this
fact
too
experience
has
plainly
shown
that
the
step
of
betting
on
a
game
he
plays
in
is
but
a
short
one
from
accepting
bribes
to
lose
a
game
the
rule
should
long
ago
have
been
replaced
in
the
code
the
cleveland
leader
says
the
patrons
of
the
game
have
begun
to
realize
the
true
inwardness
of
scientific
batting
as
shown
in
the
securing
of
single
bases
by
place
hits
safe
taps
of
balls
to
short
outfield
and
skilful
efforts
in
sacrifice
hitting
and
bunting
every
such
hit
forwarding
a
run
or
sending
a
run
in
of
course
to
occupants
of
the
bleaching
boards
as
a
rule
the
great
attraction
is
the
long
hit
for
a
home
run
which
is
made
at
the
cost
of
a
sprint
and
at
the
loss
of
all
chances
for
skilful
fielding
but
to
the
best
judges
of
scientific
batting
the
safe
tap
of
the
swiftly
pitched
ball
the
bunt
or
the
effort
to
make
a
safe
hit
to
right
field
which
if
it
fails
at
least
yields
a
sacrifice
hit
is
far
more
attractive
than
the
old
rut
of
slugging
for
home
runs
and
making
fungo
hits
to
the
outfielders
there
is
something
to
fight
for
in
the
winning
of
a
state
championship
honors
while
there
is
little
or
nothing
at
stake
in
a
trio
or
duo
state
league
suppose
each
state
had
a
four
or
six
club
circuit
and
at
the
close
of
its
season
each
august
or
september
what
a
paying
series
of
october
games
could
be
arranged
in
the
southern
section
of
the
country
in
october
for
a
grand
championship
series
for
the
prize
of
leading
all
the
state
leagues
of
the
country
for
the
honors
of
the
champion
pennant
of
state
league
organizations
by
all
means
let
state
leagues
be
organized
until
every
state
in
the
union
north
south
east
and
west
has
its
representative
state
league
the
fickle
nature
of
base
ball
rooters
was
conspicuously
shown
at
the
polo
grounds
in
at
the
end
of
the
june
campaign
when
the
new
york
giants
stood
sixth
in
the
race
ward
stock
among
the
local
cranks
and
rooters
stood
below
par
at
the
close
of
the
july
campaign
however
that
same
stock
was
at
a
premium
and
yet
it
was
the
same
john
ward
at
the
head
of
the
giants
in
may
there
were
none
so
poor
to
do
him
reverence
in
august
john
was
carried
off
the
field
a
hero
of
such
are
the
cranks
and
rooters
a
toronto
paper
says
spalding
brothers
will
present
to
the
champion
club
of
all
regularly
organized
base
ball
leagues
junior
or
senior
in
canada
a
valuable
flag
pennant
shaped
made
of
serviceable
white
bunting
red
lettered
and
valued
at
the
flags
will
be
forwarded
duty
free
immediately
after
the
season
closes
each
league
must
consist
of
four
or
more
clubs
and
each
club
must
play
not
less
than
championship
games
this
is
a
good
plan
to
encourage
the
game
on
foreign
soil
it
has
worked
well
in
england
and
australia
too
among
the
magnates
of
the
league
who
could
be
seen
at
nearly
all
of
the
home
games
of
the
twelve
clubs
during
the
past
season
were
the
boston
triumvirate
soden
conant

irrepressible

the
energetic

al
spalding
successor
president
hart
of
chicago
the
louisville
team
was
a
strong
one
as
regards
its
individual
players
but
it
lacked
harmony
in
its
ranks
and
suffered
from
cliques
with
two
in
its
team
besides
the
one
who
ran
it
but
little
else
could
be
expected
ambitious
are
obstacles
in
the
way
of
successful
management
of
a
team
one
regular
captain
should
be
the
rule
with
an
acknowledged
lieutenant
a
pair
like
comiskey
and
latham
who
worked
the
old
louis
browns
up
to
being
winners
of
pennant
honors
it
is
a
noteworthy
fact
that
anson
has
been
manager
and
captain
of
the
chicago
club
teams
since
and
from
that

to
this

the

sheehan

list
with

all
three
of
these
are

of
drauby
record
which
led
the
eastern
league
the
previous
year
rudderham
led
the
pitchers
in

his
position
the
club
averages
are
significant
they
show
that
the
providence
champions
turned
up
third
in
batting
and
led
the
list
in
fielding
thus
they
deserved
to
win

the
presidents
of
the
national
this
is
the
twentieth
year
of
the
existence
of
the
national
league
and
in
all
that
time
but
four
members
of
the
league
have
occupied
the
presidential
chair
morgan
bulkeley
of
connecticut
the
last
hulbert
mills
the
leading
spirit
of
the
great
new
york
athletic
club
and
young
the
present
and
worthy
president
of
the
league
bulkeley
served
during
hulbert
from
to
his
death
in
mills
from
that
date
up
to
when
business
requirements
led
to
his
resignation
and
young
since
then
from
the
organization
of
the
national
league
in
to
the
day
of
his
death
hulbert
was
the
great
moving
spirit
in
the
reforms
in
the
government
of
the
professional
clubs
of
the
country
which
marked
the
period
from
to
the
eighties
it
was
his
influence
largely
which
led
to
the
war
upon
the
crookedness
which
marked
the
early
years
of
professional
base
ball
history
in
which
pool
gambling
was
the
potent
factor
it
took
years
of
cohesive
and
even
arbitrary
legislation
to
eliminate
the
poison
of
the
pool
rooms
from
the
professional
system
but
success
was
finally
achieved
and
to
the
late
president
hulbert
and
his
able
coadjutors
in
the
league
does
the
credit
of
this
success
belong
during
the
league
regime
under
president
mills
the
great
union
safety
compact
known
as
the
national
agreement
sprang
into
existence
and
its
author
mills
at
this
day
has
reason
to
be
proud
of
the
good
work
he
did
for
professional
ball
playing
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
game
at
large
in
the
perfecting
of
this
bond
of
union
between
the
reputable
clubs
of
the
professional
fraternity
the
wisdom
of
the
measure
as
a
protection
against
the
abuses
of
revolving
and
contract
breaking
has
been
very
strikingly
shown
by
court
decisions
which
oblige
professional
clubs
to
depend
entirely
upon
base
ball
law
and
not
the
common
law
for
the
preservation
of
their
club
rights
in
contracting
with
players
for
their
services
on
the
field
since
mills
left
the
league
arena
he
has
done
most
efficient
service
in
conserving
the
best
interests
of
the
new
york
athletic
club
and
those
of
the
clubs
of
the
amateur
athletic
union
at
large
the
great
master
of
league
records
and
the
whilom
secretary
of
the
league
since
its
organization
young
is
known
throughout
the
entire
base
ball
world
alike
for
the
integrity
of
his
character
the
geniality
of
his
disposition
and
the
marked
industry
and
persevering
application
which
has
characterized
the
discharge
of
his
onerous
official
duties
it
is
well
known
that
old
nick
is
frequently
alluded
to
in
daily
life
as
the
of
the
world
but
the
old
nick
of
the
base
ball
arena
presents
a
character
the
very
opposite
in
every
respect
of
his
devilish
namesake
the
one
being
the
spirit
of
evil
and
the
other
the
spirit
of
honor
and
good
nature
long
may
he
live
to
honor
the
position
and
uphold
the
reformation
in
the
base
ball
world
which
his
predecessors
so
creditably
originated
and
supported
young
is
a
native
of
amsterdam
he
was
but
a
mere
boy
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
between
the
states
but
he
was
game
to
the
core
and
among
the
first
from
his
home
country
to
enlist
in
the
union
service
just
before
the
war
he
appeared
as
an
athletic
young
fellow
with
muscles
that
would
have
done
credit
to
one
as
large
again
as
he
was
he
was
looked
on
as
the
best
cricket
player
in
the
section
of
the
country
in
which
he
lived
playing
frequently
on
elevens
which
had
besides
himself
george
and
harry
wright
as
members
you
should
hear
nick
relate
anecdotes
of
his
career
as
a
cricketer
at
the
close
of
the
war
young
made
washington
his
residence
and

an
excellent

has
occupied
his
position
through
several
administrations
from

he
became
interested
in
the
national
game
of
base
ball
and
eventually
in
connection
with
mills
he
started
the
old
olympic
club
of
washington
and
then
it
was
that
he
took
the
field
again
in
he
was
elected
secretary
of
the
old
national
association
of
base
ball
players
not

rules
we
have
very
little
to
comment
upon
this
year
in
regard
to
the
amendments
made
to
the
playing
rules
of
the
game
alike
by
the
special
committee
appointed
to
revise
them
or
by
the
committee
of
the
whole
who
do
the
final
work
of
revision
no
improvement
in
this
branch
of
league
legislative
work
too
may
be
looked
for
until
a
regular
and
permanent
committee
of
rules
be
appointed
with
president
young
as
its
continuous
chairman
aided
by
the
chief
of
the
umpire
staff
harry
wright
and
one
member
of
the
league
a
member
like
byrne
who
has
done
more
since
he
has
been
in
the
league
to
really
improve
the
game
than
any
other
of
the
several
members
of
the
rules
committee
since
moreover
the
report
sent
in
by
this
proposed
permanent
committee
of
rules
should
not
be
changed
by
the
committee
of
the
whole
at
the
spring
meetings
except
by
a
vote
as
it
is
now
the
whole
business
would
likely
be
spoiled
by
the
final
revision
made
by
a
simple
majority
vote
the
changes
made
by
the
committee
of
in
several
instances
did
not
improve
the
game
at
all
the
amendment
made
to
the
bat
rule
which
removed
the
restrictions
as
to
size
was
absurd
the
league
did
well
to
throw
it
out
the
gain
in
the
diameter
of
the
bat
though
small
will
have
its
effect
on
the
batting
a
quarter
of
an
inch
is
not
much
but
it
will
tell
the
abolition
of
the
mitt
except
for
catchers
and
first
basemen
was
a
good
move
as
was
the
introduction
of
a
penalty
for
the
failure
of
umpires
to
prevent
kicking
one
change
introduces
a
new
experiment
and
that
is
the
call
of
a
strike
on
every
foul
tip
caught
on
the
fly
the
calls
of
strikes
will
be
more
numerous
than
ever
the
regular
strikes
the
strikes
on
foul
bunts
and
on
foul
tips
as
to
the
change
made
in
the
pitcher
plate
nothing
was
gained
by
it
the
pitcher
will
still
violate
the
rule
requiring
him
to
have
his
foot
in
contact
with
the
rubber
plate
as
he
did
last
year
he
can
not
get
a
firm
foothold
by
placing
his
foot
on
the
rubber
what
was
wanted
was
a
hollow
oblong
square
inches
in
which
the
pitcher
could
have
obtained
a
good
firm
foothold
within
the
box
and
not
as
now
outside
of
it
as
he
now
has
to
to
secure
a
good
standpoint
for
his
pivot
foot
outside
of
the
box
not
a
single
change
was
made
in
the
scoring
rules
and
in
consequence
the
same
old
premium
for
record
batting
is
offered
to
every
fungo
hitter
in
the
ranks
each
member
of
the
committee
still
walks
in
the
same
old
rut
in
this
respect
one
of
the
best
changes
was
the
following
rule
reads
now
so
that
players
using
vulgar
indecent
or
other
improper
language
shall
be
fined
and
instead
of
and
in
rule
section
was
stricken
out
and
the
following
substituted
upon
notification
from
an
umpire
that
a
fine
has
been
imposed
upon
any
manager
captain
or
player
the
secretary
shall
forthwith
notify
the
person
so
fined
and
also
the
club
of
which
he
is
a
member
and
in
the
event
of
the
failure
of
the
person
so
fined
to
pay
the
amount
within
five
days
he
shall
be
debarred
from
participating
in
any
championship
game
until
such
fine
is
paid
the
committee
still
retained
that
problem
in
mathematics
contained
in
the
first
rule
a
description
of
how
to
lay
out
a
field
which
would
puzzle
a
yale
quarterback
the
change
made
in
rule
section
is
a
good
one
only
the
batsman
who
has
failed
to
bat
in
his
proper
turn
can
be
declared
out
not
those
who
have
batted
out
of
turn
in
consequence
of
the
former
error
it
will
now
cost
a
kicker
at
least
for
indulging
in
his
hustling
tactics
that
was
a
resolution
adopted
by
the
league
forbidding
any
club
from
paying

fine

attention
to
the
fact
that

integrity
its
honesty
and
the
purity
of
its
methods
he
has
been
an
unflinching
foe
of
those
within
the

who
permitted
any
stigma
to
attach
to
it
and
a
gallant
defender
against
any

good
name
and
fame

discount
the
best

in

in

it
is
neatly
constructed

is
a
marvel
of
simplicity
it
is
so
small
that
no

will
notice
it
and
the
batsmen
will
wonder
where
those
awful
curves
come
from
the
pitcher
who
uses
