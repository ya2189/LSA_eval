note
it
should
be
noted
that
many
of
the
monuments
and
sites
of
excavations
in
egypt
mesopotamia
persia
and
kurdistan
described
in
this
volume
have
been
visited
by
the
authors
in
connection
with
their
own
work
in
those
countries
the
greater
number
of
the
photographs
here
published
were
taken
by
the

themselves
their

are
due
to

kindly
allowing
them
to
make
use
of
a
number
of

issued
by
them
preface
the
present
volume
contains
an
account
of
the
most
important
additions
which
have
been
made
to
our
knowledge
of
the
ancient
history
of
egypt
and
western
asia
during
the
few
years
which
have
elapsed
since
the
publication
of
ancienne
des
peuples
de
and
includes
short
descriptions
of
the
excavations
from
which
these
results
have
been
obtained
it
is
in
no
sense
a
connected
and
continuous
history
of
these
countries
for
that
has
already
been
written
by
maspero
but
is
rather
intended
as
an
appendix
or
addendum
to
his
work
briefly
recapitulating
and
describing
the
discoveries
made
since
its
appearance
on
this
account
we
have
followed
a
geographical
rather
than
a
chronological
system
of
arrangement
but
at
the
same
time
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
suggest
to
the
mind
of
the
reader
the
historical
sequence
of
events
at
no
period
have
excavations
been
pursued
with
more
energy
and
activity
both
in
egypt
and
western
asia
than
at
the
present
time
and
every
work
obliges
us
to
modify
former
theories
and
extends
our
knowledge
of
periods
of
history
which
even
ten
years
ago
were
unknown
to
the
historian
for
instance
a
whole
chapter
has
been
added
to
egyptian
history
by
the
discovery
of
the
neolithic
culture
of
the
primitive
egyptians
while
the
recent
excavations
at
susa
are
revealing
a
hitherto
totally
unsuspected
epoch
of
civilization
further
than
this
we
have
discovered
the
relics
of
the
oldest
historical
kings
of
egypt
and
we
are
now
enabled
to
reconstitute
from
material
as
yet
unpublished
the
of
the
early
dynasties
of
babylon
important
discoveries
have
also
been
made
with
regard
to
isolated
points
in
the
later
historical
periods
we
have
therefore
attempted
to
include
the
most
important
of
these
in
our
survey
of
recent
excavations
and
their
results
we
would
again
remind
the
reader
that
great
work
must
be
consulted
for
the
complete
history
of
the
period
the
present
volume
being
not
a
connected
history
of
egypt
and
western
asia
but
a
description
and
discussion
of
the
manner
in
which
recent
discovery
and
research
have
added
to
and
modified
our
conceptions

the

during

our
conception
of
the
beginnings
of
egyptian
antiquity
has
profoundly
altered
when
maspero
published
the
first
volume
of
his
great
ancienne
des
peuples
des
in
egyptian
history
properly
so
called
still
began
with
the
khufu
and
khafra
cheops
and
chephren
and
the
legendary
lists
of
earlier
kings
preserved
at
abydos
and
sakkara
were
still
quoted
as
the
only
source
of
knowledge
of
the
time
before
the
ivth
dynasty
of
a
prehistoric
egypt
nothing
was
known
beyond
a
few
flint
flakes
gathered
here
and
there
upon
the
desert
plateaus
which
might
or
might
not
tell
of
an
age
when
the
ancestors
of
the
knew
only
the
stone
tools
and
weapons
of
the
primeval
savage
now
however
the
veil
which
has
hidden
the
beginnings
of
egyptian
civilization
from
us
has
been
lifted
and
we
see
things
more
or
less
as
they
actually
were
unobscured
by
the
traditions
of
a
later
day
until
the
last
few
years
nothing
of
the
real
beginnings
of
history
in
either
egypt
or
mesopotamia
had
been
found
legend
supplied
the
only
material
for
the
reconstruction
of
the
earliest
history
of
the
oldest
civilized
nations
of
the
globe
nor
was
it
seriously
supposed
that
any
relics
of
prehistoric
egypt
or
mesopotamia
ever
would
be
found
the
antiquity
of
the
known
history
of
these
countries
already
appeared
so
great
that
nobody
took
into
consideration
the
possibility
of
our
discovering
a
prehistoric
egypt
or
mesopotamia
the
idea
was
too
remote
from
practical
work
and
further
civilization
in
these
countries
had
lasted
so
long
that
it
seemed
more
than
probable
that
all
traces
of
their
prehistoric
age
had
long
since
been
swept
away
yet
the
possibility
which
seemed
hardly
worth
a
consideration
in
is
in
an
assured
reality
at
least
as
far
as
egypt
is
concerned
prehistoric
babylonia
has
yet
to
be
discovered
it
is
true
for
example
that
at
the
site
of
ancient
ur
of
the
chaldees
burials
in
earthenware
coffins
in
which
the
skeletons
lie
in
the
position
characteristic
of
neolithic
interments
have
been
found
but
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
these
are
burials
of
a
much
later
date
belonging
quite
possibly
to
the
parthian
period
nothing
that
may
rightfully
be
termed
prehistoric
has
yet
been
found
in
the
euphrates
valley
whereas
in
egypt
prehistoric
antiquities
are
now
almost
as
well
known
and
as
well
represented
in
our
museums
as
are
the
prehistoric
antiquities
of
europe
and
america
with
the
exception
of
a
few
palasoliths
from
the
surface
of
the
syrian
desert
near
the
euphrates
valley
not
a
single
implement
of
the
age
of
stone
has
yet
been
found
in
southern
mesopotamia
whereas
egypt
has
yielded
to
us
the
most
perfect
examples
of
the
art
known
flint
tools
and
weapons
more
beautiful
than
the
finest
that
europe
and
america
can
show
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
southern
mesopotamia
is
an
alluvial
country
and
the
ancient
cities
which
doubtless
mark
the
sites
of
the
oldest
settlements
in
the
land
are
situated
in
the
alluvial
marshy
plain
between
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
so
that
all
traces
of
the
neolithic
culture
of
the
country
would
seem
to
have
disappeared
buried
deep
beneath
clay
and
marsh
it
is
the
same
in
the
egyptian
delta
a
similar
country
and
here
no
traces
of
the
prehistoric
culture
of
egypt
have
been
found
the
attempt
to
find
them
was
made
last
year
at
buto
which
is
known
to
be
one
of
the
most
antique
centres
of
civilization
and
probably
was
one
of
the
earliest
settlements
in
egypt
but
without
success
the
infiltration
of
water
had
made
excavation
impossible
and
had
no
doubt
destroyed
everything
belonging
to
the
most
ancient
settlement
it
is
not
going
too
far
to
predict
that
exactly
the
same
thing
will
be
found
by
any
explorer
who
tries
to
discover
a
neolithic
stratum
beneath
a
of
babylonia
there
is
little
hope
that
prehistoric
chaldæa
will
ever
be
known
to
us
but
in
egypt
the
conditions
are
different
the
delta
is
like
babylonia
it
is
true
but
in
the
upper
nile
valley
the
river
flows
down
with
but
a
thin
border
of
alluvial
land
on
either
side
through
the
rocky
and
hilly
desert
the
dry
sahara
where
rain
falls
but
once
in
two
or
three
years
antiquities
buried
in
this
soil
in
the
most
remote
ages
are
preserved
intact
as
they
were
first
interred
until
the
modern
investigator
comes
along
to
look
for
them
and
it
is
on
the
desert
margin
of
the
valley
that
the
remains
of
prehistoric
egypt
have
been
found
that
is
the
reason
for
their
perfect
preservation
till
our
own
day
and
why
we
know
prehistoric
egypt
so
well
the
chief
work
of
egyptian
civilization
was
the
proper
irrigation
of
the
alluvial
soil
the
turning
of
marsh
into
cultivated
fields
and
the
reclamation
of
land
from
the
desert
for
the
purposes
of
agriculture
owing
to
the
rainless
character
of
the
country
the
only
means
of
obtaining
water
for
the
crops
is
by
irrigation
and
where
the
fertilizing
nile
water
can
not
be
taken
by
means
of
canals
there
cultivation
ends
and
the
desert
begins
before
egyptian
civilization
properly
so
called
began
the
valley
was
a
great
marsh
through
which
the
nile
found
its
way
north
to
the
sea
the
ancestors
of
the
civilized
egyptians
hunted
wild
fowl
crocodiles
and
hippopotami
in
the
marshy
valley
but
except
in
a
few
isolated
settlements
on
convenient
mounds
here
and
there
the
forerunners
of
the
later
villages
they
did
not
live
there
their
settlements
were
on
the
dry
desert
margin
and
it
was
here
upon
low
tongues
of
desert
hill
jutting
out
into
the
plain
that
they
buried
their
dead
their
simple
shallow
graves
were
safe
from
the
flood
and
but
for
the
depredations
of
jackals
and
hyenas
here
they
have
remained
intact
till
our
own
day
and
have
yielded
up
to
us
the
facts
from
which
we
have
derived
our
knowledge
of
prehistoric
egypt
thus
it
is
that
we
know
so
much
of
the
egyptians
of
the
stone
age
while
of
their
contemporaries
in
mesopotamia
we
know
nothing
nor
is
anything
further
likely
to
be
discovered
but
these
desert
cemeteries
with
their
crowds
of
oval
shallow
graves
covered
by
only
a
few
inches
of
surface
soil
in
which
the
neolithic
egyptians
lie
crouched
up
with
their
flint
implements
and
polished
pottery
beside
them
are
but
monuments
of
the
later
age
of
prehistoric
egypt
long
before
the
neolithic
egyptian
hunted
his
game
in
the
marshes
and
here
and
there
essayed
the
work
of
reclamation
for
the
purposes
of
an
incipient
agriculture
a
far
older
race
inhabited
the
valley
of
the
nile
the
written
records
of
egyptian
civilization
go
back
four
thousand
years
before
christ
or
earlier
and
the
neolithic
age
of
egypt
must
go
back
to
a
period
several
thousand
years
before
that
but
we
can
now
go
back
much
further
still
to
the
palaeolithic
age
of
egypt
at
a
time
when
europe
was
still
covered
by
the
ice
and
snows
of
the
glacial
period
and
man
fought
as
an
equal
hardly
yet
as
a
superior
with
and
mammoth
the
palaeolithic
egyptians
lived
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
their
habitat
was
doubtless
the
desert
slopes
often
too
the
plateaus
themselves
but
that
they
lived
entirely
upon
the
plateaus
high
up
above
the
nile
marsh
is
improbable
there
it
is
true
we
find
their
flint
implements
the
great
weapons
of
the
types
of
chelles
acheul
and
le
moustier
types
well
known
to
all
who
are
acquainted
with
the
flint
implements
of
the
in
europe
and
it
is
there
that
the
theory
generally
accepted
hitherto
has
placed
the
habitat
of
the
makers
and
users
of
these
implements
the
idea
was
that
in
palaeolithic
days
contemporary
with
the
glacial
age
of
northern
europe
and
america
the
climate
of
egypt
was
entirely
different
from
that
of
later
times
and
of
instead
of
dry
desert
the
mountain
plateaus
bordering
the
nile
valley
were
supposed
to
have
been
then
covered
with
forest
through
which
flowed
countless
streams
to
feed
the
river
below
it
was
suggested
that
remains
of
these
streams
were
to
be
seen
in
the
side
ravines
or
wadis
of
the
nile
valley
which
run
up
from
the
low
desert
on
the
river
level
into
the
hills
on
either
hand
these
wadis
undoubtedly
show
extensive
traces
of
strong
water
action
they
curve
and
twist
as
the
streams
found
their
easiest
way
to
the
level
through
the
softer
strata
they
are
heaped
up
with
great
boulders
they
are
hollowed
out
where
waterfalls
once
fell
they
have
the
appearance
of
dry
watercourses
exactly
what
any
mountain
burns
would
be
were
the
suddenly
cut
off
for
ever
the
climate
altered
from
rainy
to
eternal
and
every
plant
and
tree
blasted
never
to
grow
again
acting
on
the
supposition
that
this
idea
was
a
correct
one
most
observers
have
concluded
that
the
climate
of
egypt
in
remote
periods
was
very
different
from
the
dry
rainless
one
now
obtaining
to
provide
the
water
for
the
wadi
streams
heavy
rainfall
and
forests
are
desiderated
they
were
easily
supplied
on
the
hypothesis
forests
clothed
the
mountain
plateaus
heavy
rains
fell
and
the
water
rushed
down
to
the
nile
carving
out
the
great
watercourses
which
remain
to
this
day
bearing
testimony
to
the
truth
and
the
flints
which
the
palaeolithic
inhabitants
of
the
made
and
used
still
lie
on
the
now
treeless
and
desert
surface
illustration
the
bed
of
an
ancient
watercourse
in
the
wadiyên
thebes
this
is
certainly
a
very
weak
conclusion
in
fact
it
seriously
damages
the
whole
argument
the
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
the
palæoliths
are
there
they
can
be
picked
up
by
any
visitor
there
they
lie
great
flints
of
the
drift
types
just
like
those
found
in
the
of
england
and
belgium
on
the
desert
surface
where
they
were
made
undoubtedly
where
they
were
made
for
the
places
where
they
lie
are
the
actual
ancient
flint
workshops
where
the
flints
were
chipped
everywhere
around
are
innumerable
flint
chips
and
perfect
weapons
burnt
black
and
patinated
by
ages
of
sunlight
we
are
taking
one
particular
spot
in
the
hills
of
western
thebes
as
an
example
but
there
are
plenty
of
others
such
as
the
wadi
on
the
right
bank
of
the
nile
opposite
maghagha
whence
has
brought
back
specimens
of
flint
tools
of
all
ages
from
the
palaeolithic
to
the
neolithic
periods
the
palæolithic
flint
workshops
on
the
theban
hills
have
been
visited
of
late
years
by
by
schweinfurth
allen
sturge
and
blanckenhorn
by
portch
ayrton
and

the
weapons
illustrated
here
were
found
by
hall
and
ayrton
and
are
now
preserved
in
the
british
museum
among
these
flints
shown

notice
two
fine
specimens
of
the
type
of
acheul

curious
implements

primitive

deep
they
lie
as
they
were
left
in
the
palæolithic
age
and
they
have
lain
there
till
taken
away
by
the
modern
explorer
but
this
is
not
the
case
with
all
the
palæolithic
flints
of
thebes
in
the
year
discovered
palæolithic
flints
in
the
deposit
of
diluvial
detritus
which
lies
between
the
cultivation
and
the
mountains
on
the
west
bank
of
the
nile
opposite
luxor
many
of
these
are
of
the
same
type
as
those
found
on
the
surface
of
the
mountain
plateau
which
lies
at
the
head
of
the
great
of
the
tombs
of
the
kings
while
the
diluvial
deposit
is
at
its
mouth
the
stuff
of
which
the
detritus
is
composed
evidently
came
originally
from
the
high
plateau
and
was
washed
down
with
the
flints
in
ancient
times
this
is
quite
conceivable
but
how
is
it
that
the
flints
left
behind
on
the
plateau
remain
on
the
original
ancient
surface
how
is
it
conceivable
that
if
on
the
old
theory
these
plateaus
were
in
palæolithic
days
clothed
with
forest
the
palæolithic
flints
could
even
in
a
single
instance
remain
undisturbed
from
palæolithic
times
to
the
present
day
when
the
forest
in
which
they
were
made
and
the
forest
soil
on
which
they
reposed
have
entirely
disappeared
if
there
were
woods
and
forests
on
the
heights
it
would
seem
impossible
that
we
should
find
as
we
do
palæolithic
implements
lying
in
situ
on
the
desert
surface
around
the
actual
manufactories
where
they
were
made
yet
if
the
constant
rainfall
and
the
vegetation
of
the
libyan
desert
area
in
palæolithic
days
is
all
a
myth
as
it
most
probably
is
how
came
the
embedded
palaeoliths
found
by
in
the
bed
of
diluvial
detritus
which
is
apparently
from
the
plateau
brought
down
by
the
palæolithic
streams
water
erosion
has
certainly
formed
the
theban
but
this
water
erosion
was
probably
not
that
which
would
be
the
result
of
perennial
streams
flowing
down
from
wooded
heights
but
of
torrents
like
those
of
which
fill
the
once
in
three
years
or
so
after
heavy
rain
but
repeated
at
much
closer
intervals
we
may
in
fact
suppose
just
so
much
difference
in
meteorological
conditions
as
would
make
it
possible
for
sudden
to
occur
over
the
desert
at
far
more
frequent
intervals
than
at
present
that
would
account
for
the
detritus
bed
at
the
mouth
of
the
and
its
embedded
flints
and
at
the
same
time
maintain
the
general
probability
of
the
idea
that
the
desert
plateaus
were
desert
in
palæolithic
days
as
now
and
that
early
man
only
knapped
his
flints
up
there
because
he
found
the
flint
there
he
himself
lived
on
the
slopes
and
nearer
the
marsh
this
new
view
seems
to
be
much
sounder
and
more
probable
than
the
old
one
maintained
by
flinders
petrie
and
blanckenhorn
according
to
which
the
high
plateau
was
the
home
of
man
in
palæolithic
times
when
the
rainfall
as
shown
by
the
valley
erosion
and
waterfalls
must
have
caused
an
abundant
vegetation
on
the
plateau
where
man
could
live
and
hunt
his
game
nagada
and
ballas
p
were
this
so
it
is
patent
that
the
palæolithic
flints
could
not
have
been
found
on
the
desert
surface
as
they
are
beadnell
of
the
geological
survey
of
egypt
to
whom
we
are
indebted
for
the
promulgation
of
the
more
modern
and
probable
view
says
it
certain
that
the
high
plateau
was
then
clothed
with
forests
what
evidence
is
there
to
show
that
it
differed
in
any
important
respect
from
its
present
aspect
and
if
as
i
suggest
desert
conditions
obtained
then
as
now
and
man
merely
worked
his
flints
along
the
edges
of
the
plateaus
overlooking
the
nile
valley
i
see
no
reason
why
flint
implements
dating
even
from
palæolithic
times
should
not
in
favourable
cases
still
be
found
in
the
spots
where
they
were
left
surrounded
by
the
flakes
struck
off
in
manufacture
on
the
flat
plateaus
the
occasional
rains
which
fall
once
in
three
or
four
years
can
effect
but
little
transport
of
material
and
merely
lower
the
general
level
by
dissolving
the
underlying
limestone
so
that
the
plateau
surface
is
left
with
a
coating
of
nodules
and
blocks
of
insoluble
flint
and
chert
flint
implements
might
thus
be
expected
to
remain
in
many
localities
for
indefinite
periods
but
they
would
certainly
become
more
or
less
pitted
on
the
surface
and
rounded
at
the
angles
after
long
exposure
to
heat
cold
and
blown
this
is
exactly
the
case
of
the
palæolithic
flint
tools
from
the
desert
plateau
illustration
upper
desert
plateau
where
paleolithic

are
found
thebes
leet
above
the
nile
we
do
not
know
whether
palæolithic
man
in
egypt
was
contemporary
with
the
of
europe
we
have
no
means
of
gauging
the
age
of
the
palæolithic
egyptian
weapons
as
we
have
for
the
neolithic
period
the
historical
dynastic
period
of
egyptian
annals
began
with
the
unification
of
the
kingdom
under
one
head
somewhere
about
at
that
time
copper
as
well
as
stone
weapons
were
used
so
that
we
may
say
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
historical
age
the
egyptians
were
living
in
the
period
we
can
trace
the
use
of
copper
back
for
a
considerable
period
anterior
to
the
beginning
of
the
ist
dynasty
so
that
we
shall
probably
not
be
far
wrong
if
we
do
not
bring
down
the
close
of
the
purely
neolithic
age
in
egypt
the
close
of
the
age
of
stone
properly
so
called
later
than
how
far
back
in
the
remote
ages
the
transition
period
between
the
palæolithic
and
neolithic
ages
should
be
placed
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
say
the
use
of
stone
for
weapons
and
implements
continued
in
egypt
as
late
as
the
time
of
the
xiith
dynasty
about
but
these
xiith
dynasty
stone
implements
show
by
their
forms
how
late
they
are
in
the
history
of
the
stone
age
the
axe
heads
for
instance
are
in
form
imitations
of
the
copper
and
bronze
axe
heads
usual
at
that
period
they
are
stone
imitations
of
metal
instead
of
the
originals
on
whose
model
the
metal
weapons
were
formed
the
flint
implements
of
the
xiith
dynasty
were
a
curious
survival
from
long
past
ages
after
the
time
of
the
xiith
dynasty
stone
was
no
longer
used
for
tools
or
weapons
except
for
the
sacred
rite
of
making
the
first
incision
in
the
dead
bodies
before
beginning
the
operations
of
embalming
for
this
purpose
as
herodotus
tells
us
an
was
used
this
was
no
doubt
a
knife
of
flint
or
chert
like
those
of
the
neolithic
ancestors
of
the
egyptians
and
the
continued
use
of
a
stone
knife
for
this
one
purpose
only
is
a
very
interesting
instance
of
a
ceremonial
survival
we
may
compare
the
wigs
of
british
judges
illustration
flint
knife
we
have
no
specimen
of
a
flint
knife
which
can
definitely
be
asserted
to
have
belonged
to
an
embalmer
but
of
the
archaistic
flint
weapons
of
the
xiith
dynasty
we
have
several
specimens
they
were
found
by
petrie
at
the
place
named
by
him
the
site
of
a
xiith
dynasty
town
built
near
the
pyramid
of
king
usertsen
or
senusret
ii
at
illahun
at
the
mouth
of
the
canal
leading
from
the
nile
valley
into
the
of
the
payyum
these
kahun
flints
and
others
of
probably
the
same
period
found
by
at
the
very
ancient
flint
works
in
the
wadi
are
of
very
coarse
and
poor
workmanship
as
compared
with
the
triumphs
of
the
late
neolithic
and
early
chalcolithic
periods
the
delicacy
of
the
art
had
all
been
lost
but
the
best
flint
knives
of
the
early
period
dating
to
just
a
little
before
the
time
of
the
ist
dynasty
when
had
attained
its
apogee
and
copper
had
just
begun
to
be
used
are
undoubtedly
the
most
remarkable
stone
weapons
ever
made
in
the
world
the
grace
and
utility
of
the
form
the
delicacy
of
the
fluted
chipping
on
the
side
and
the
minute
care
with
which
the
tiny
serrations
of
the
cutting
edge
serrations
so
small
that
often
they
can
hardly
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye
are
made
can
certainly
not
be
parallelled
elsewhere
the
art
of
reached
its
zenith
in
ancient
egypt
the
specimen
illustrated
has
a
handle
covered
with
gold
decorated
with
incised
designs
representing
animals
the
prehistoric
egyptians
may
also
fairly
be
said
to
have
attained
greater
perfection
than
other
peoples
in
the
neolithic
stage
of
culture
in
other
arts
besides
the
making
of
stone
tools
and
weapons
their
pottery
is
of
remarkable
perfection
now
that
the
sites
of
the
egyptian
prehistoric
settlements
have
been
so
thoroughly
explored
by
competent
archæologists
and
unhappily
as
thoroughly
pillaged
by
incompetent
natives
this
prehistoric
egyptian
pottery
has
become
extremely
well
known
in
fact
it
is
so
common
that
good
specimens
may
be
bought
anywhere
in
egypt
for
a
few
piastres
most
museums
possess
sets
of
this
pottery
of
which
great
quantities
have
been
brought
back
from
egypt
by
petrie
and
other
explorers
it
is
of
very
great
interest
artistically
as
well
as
historically
the
wheel
was
not
yet
invented
and
all
the
vases
even
those
of
the
most
perfect
shape
were
built
up
by
hand
the
perfection
of
form
attained
without
the
aid
of
the
wheel
is
truly
marvellous
the
commonest
type
of
this
pottery
is
a
red
polished
ware
vase
with
black
top
due
to
its
having
been
baked
mouth
downward
in
a
fire
the
ashes
of
which
according
to
petrie
deoxidized
the
hæmatite
burnishing
and
so
turned
the
red
colour
to
black
good
examples
the
hæmatite
has
not
only
been
reduced
to
black
magnetic
oxide
but
the
black
has
the
highest
polish
as
seen
on
fine
greek
vases
this
is
probably
due
to
the
formation
of
carbonyl
gas
in
the
smothered
fire
this
gas
acts
as
a
solvent
of
magnetic
oxide
and
hence
allows
it
to
assume
a
new
surface
like
the
glassy
surface
of
some
marbles
subjected
to
solution
in
this
black
and
red
ware
appears
to
be
the
most
ancient

pottery

and
a

with

or

predynastic
period
before
these

are
in
deep

with
this
elaborate
pottery
the
neolithic
ceramic
art
of
egypt
reached
its
highest
point
in
the
succeeding
period
the
beginning
of
the
historic
age
there
was
a
decline
in
workmanship
exhibiting
clumsy
forms
and
bad
colour
and
it
is
not
until
the
time
of
the
ivth
dynasty
that
good
pottery
a
fine
polished
red
is
once
more
found
meanwhile
the
invention
of
glazed
pottery
which
was
unknown
to
the
prehistoric
egyptians
had
been
made
before
the
beginning
of
the
ist
dynasty
the
unglazed
ware
of
the
first
three
dynasties
was
bad
but
the
new
invention
of
light
blue
glazed
faience
not
porcelain
properly
so
called
seems
to
have
made
great
progress
and
we
possess
fine
specimens
at
the
beginning
of
the
ist
dynasty
the
prehistoric
egyptians
were
also
proficient
in
other
arts
they
carved
ivory
and
they
worked
gold
which
is
known
to
have
been
almost
the
first
metal
worked
by
man
certainly
in
egypt
it
was
utilized
for
ornament
even
before
copper
was
used
for
work
we
may
refer
to
the
illustration
of
a
flint
knife
with
gold
handle
already
given
see
illustration
the
date
of
the
actual
introduction
of
copper
for
tools
and
weapons
into
egypt
is
uncertain
but
it
seems
probable
that
copper
was
occasionally
used
at
a
very
early
period
copper
weapons
have
been
found
in
graves
beside
the
finest
buff
pottery
with
elaborate
red
designs
so
that
we
may
say
that
when
the
and
pottery
of
the
neolithic
egyptians
had
reached
its
zenith
the
use
of
copper
was
already
known
and
copper
weapons
were
occasionally
employed
we
can
thus
speak
of
the
period
in
egypt
as
having
already
begun
at
that
time
no
doubt
several
centuries
before
the
beginning
of
the
historical
or
dynastic
age
strictly
speaking
the
egyptians
remained
in
the
period
till
the
end
of
the
xiith
dynasty
but
in
practice
it
is
best
to
speak
of
this
period
when
the
word
is
used
as
extending
from
the
time
of
the
finest
flint
weapons
and
pottery
of
the
prehistoric
age
when
the
period
may
be
said
to
close
till
about
the
iid
or
iiid
dynasty
by
that
time
the
or
rather
age
of
egypt
had
well
begun
and
already
stone
was
not
in
common
use
the
prehistoric
pottery
is
of
the
greatest
value
to
the
archæologist
for
with
its
help
some
idea
may
be
obtained
of
the
succession
of
periods
within
the
late
age
the
enormous
number
of
prehistoric
graves
which
have
been
examined
enables
us
to
make
an
exhaustive
comparison
of
the
different
kinds
of
pottery
found
in
them
so
that
we
can
arrange
them
in
order
according
to
pottery
they
contained
by
this
means
we
obtain
an
idea
of
the
development
of
different
types
of
pottery
and
the
sequence
of
the
types
thus
it
is
that
we
can
say
with
some
degree
of
confidence
that
the
black
and
red
ware
is
the
most
ancient
form
and
that
the
buff
with
red
designs
is
one
of
the
latest
forms
of
prehistoric
pottery
other
objects
found
in
the
graves
can
be
classified
as
they
occur
with
different
pottery
types
with
the
help
of
the
pottery
we
can
thus
gain
a
more
or
less
reliable
conspectus
of
the
development
of
the
late
culture
of
egypt
this
system
of
was
introduced
by
petrie
and
is
certainly
very
useful
it
must
not
however
be
pressed
too
far
or
be
regarded
as
an
system
with
which
all
subsequent
discoveries
must
be
made
to
fit
in
by
force
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
all
prehistoric
pottery
developed
its
series
of
types
in
an
absolutely
orderly
manner
without
deviations
or
the
work
of
hands
is
variable
and
eccentric
and
does
not
develop
or
evolve
in
an
undeviating
course
as
the
work
of
nature
does
it
is
a
mistake
very
often
made
by
anthropologists
and
archæologists
who
forget
this
elementary
fact
to
assume
of
development
and
so
forth
or
culture
on
absolutely
even
and
regular
lines
human
culture
has
not
developed
either
evenly
or
regularly
as
a
matter
of
fact
therefore
we
can
not
always
be
sure
that
because
the
egyptian
black
and
red
pottery
does
not
occur
in
graves
with
buff
and
red
it
is
for
this
reason
absolutely
earlier
in
date
than
the
latter
some
of
the
may
in
reality
be
contemporary
with
others
instead
of
earlier
and
allowance
must
always
be
made
for
aberrations
and
reversions
to
earlier
types
this
caveat
having
been
entered
however
we
may
provisionally
accept
system
of
as
giving
the
best
classification
of
the
prehistoric
antiquities
according
to
development
so
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
as
far
as
we
know
the
black
and
red
pottery
is
the
most
ancient
neolithic
egyptian
ware
known
that
the
buff
and
red
did
not
begin
to
be
used
till
about
that
bone
and
ivory
carvings
were
commonest
in
the
earlier
period
that
copper
was
almost
unknown
till
and
so
on
the
arbitrary
numbers
used
range
from
to
in
order
to
allow
for
possible
earlier
and
later
additions
which
may
be
rendered
necessary
by
the
progress
of
discovery
the
numbers
are
of
course
as
purely
arbitrary
and
relative
as
those
of
the
different
thermometrical
systems
but
they
afford
a
convenient
system
of
arrangement
the
products
of
the
prehistoric
egyptians
are
so
to
speak
distributed
on
a
conventional
plan
over
a
scale
numbered
from
to
representing
the
beginning
and
the
close
of
the
term
so
far
as
its
close
has
as
yet
been
ascertained
it
is
probable
that
more
or
less
accurately
marks
the
beginning
of
the
dynastic
or
historical
period
this
hypothetically

then
is
due
the
credit
of
systematizing
the
study
of
egyptian
prehistoric
antiquities
but
the
further
credit
of
having
these
antiquities
themselves
and
settled
their
date
belongs
not
to
him
but
to
the
distinguished
french
archæologist
de
morgan
who
was
for
several
years
director
of
the
museum
at
giza
and
is
now
chief
of
the
french
archæological
delegation
in
persia
which
has
made
of
late
years
so
many
important
discoveries
the
proof
of
the
prehistoric
date
of
this
class
of
antiquities
was
given
not
by
petrie
after
his
excavations
at
dendera
in
but
by
de
morgan
in
his
volume
sur
les
origines
de
de
la
pierre
et
les
published
in
in
this
book
the
true
chronological
position
of
the
prehistoric
antiquities
was
pointed
out
and
the
existence
of
an
egyptian
stone
age
finally
decided
de
work
was
based
on
careful
study
of
the
results
of
excavations
carried
on
for
several
years
by
the
egyptian
government
in
various
parts
of
egypt
in
the
course
of
which
a
large
number
of
cemeteries
of
the
primitive
type
had
been
discovered
it
was
soon
evident
to
de
morgan
that
these
primitive
graves
with
their
unusual
pottery
and
flint
implements
could
be
nothing
less
than
the
tombs
of
the
prehistoric
egyptians
the
egyptians
of
the
stone
age
objects
of
the
prehistoric
period
had
been
known
to
the
museums
for
many
years
previously
but
owing
to
the
uncertainty
of
their
provenance
and
the
absence
of
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
primitive
cemeteries
no
scientific
conclusions
had
been
arrived
at
with
regard
to
them
and
it
was
not
till
the
publication
of
de
book
that
they
were
recognized
and
classified
as
prehistoric
the
necropoles
investigated
by
de
morgan
and
his
assistants
extended
from
kawâmil
in
the
north
about
twenty
miles
north
of
abydos
to
edfu
in
the
south
the
chief
cemeteries
between
these
two
points
were
those
of
bât
allam
saghel
nakâda
tûkh
and
gebelên
all
the
burials
were
of
simple
type
analogous
to
those
of
the
neolithic
races
in
the
rest
of
the
world
in
a
shallow
oval
grave
excavated
often
but
a
few
inches
below
the
surface
of
the
soil
lay
the
body
cramped
up
with
the
knees
to
the
chin
sometimes
in
a
rough
box
of
pottery
more
often
with
only
a
mat
to
cover
it
ready
to
the
hand
of
the
dead
man
were
his
flint
weapons
and
tools
and
the
usual
red
and
black
or
buff
and
red
pots
lay
beside
him
originally
no
doubt
they
had
been
filled
with
the
funeral
meats
to
sustain
the
ghost
in
the
next
world
occasionally
a
simple
copper
weapon
was
found
with
the
body
were
also
buried
slate
palettes
for
grinding
the
green
which
the
egyptians
loved
even
at
this
early
period
these
are
often
carved
to
suggest
the
forms
of
animals
such
as
birds
bats
tortoises
goats
etc
on
others
are
fantastic
creatures
with
two
heads
combs
of
bone
too
are
found
ornamented
in
a
similar
way
with
or
heads
often
double
and
most
interesting
of
all
are
the
small
bone
and
ivory
figures
of
men
and
women
which
are
also
found
these
usually
have
little
blue
beads
for
eyes
and
are
of
the
quaintest
and
naivest
appearance
conceivable
here
we
have
an
elderly
man
with
a
long
pointed
beard
there
two
women
with
inane
smiles
upon
their
countenances
here
another
woman
of
better
work
this
time
with
a
child
slung
across
her
shoulder
this
figure
which
is
in
the
british
museum
must
be
very
late
as
prehistoric
egyptian
antiquities
go
it
is
almost
as
good
in
style
as
the
early
ist
dynasty
objects
such
were
the
objects
which
the
simple
piety
of
the
early
egyptian
prompted
him
to
bury
with
the
bodies
of
his
dead
in
order
that
they
might
find
solace
and
contentment
in
the
other
world
all
the
prehistoric
cemeteries
are
of
this
type
with
the
graves
pressed
closely
together
so
that
they
often
impinge
upon
one
another
the
nearness
of
the
graves
to
the
surface
is
due
to
the
exposed
positions
at
the
entrances
to
in
which
the
primitive
cemeteries
are
usually
found
the
result
is
that
they
are
always
swept
by
the
winds
which
prevent
the
desert
sand
from
accumulating
over
them
and
so
have
preserved
the
original
level
of
the
ground
from
their
proximity
to
the
surface
they
are
often
found
disturbed
more
often
by
the
agency
of
jackals
than
that

the

of

and
nakada
on
the
west
bank
of
the
nile
opposite
koptos
a
series
of
extensive
cemeteries
of
the
primitive
type
from
which
they
obtained
a
large
number
of
antiquities
published
in
their
volume
nagada
and
dallas
the
plates
giving
representations
of
the
antiquities
found
were
of
the
highest
interest
but
the
scientific
value
of
the
is
vitiated
by
the
fact
that
the
true
historical
position
of
the
antiquities
was
not
perceived
by
their
discoverers
who
came
to
the
conclusion
that
these
remains
were
those
of
a
of
libyan
invaders
this
race
they
supposed
had
entered
egypt
after
the
close
of
the
flourishing
period
of
the
at
the
end
of
the
vith
dynasty
and
had
occupied
part
of
the
nile
valley
from
that
time
till
the
period
of
the
xth
dynasty
this
conclusion
was
proved
erroneous
by
de
morgan
almost
as
soon
as
made
and
the
french
identification
of
the
primitive
remains
as
was
at
once
generally
accepted
it
was
obvious
that
a
hypothesis
of
the
settlement
of
a
barbaric
race
in
the
midst
of
egypt
at
so
late
a
date
as
the
period
immediately
preceding
the
xiith
dynasty
a
race
which
mixed
in
no
way
with
the
native
egyptians
themselves
and
left
no
trace
of
their
influence
upon
the
later
egyptians
was
one
which
demanded
greater
faith
than
the
simple
explanation
of
de
morgan
the
error
of
the
british
explorers
was
at
once
admitted
by
quibell
in
his
volume
on
the
excavations
of
at
published
in
quibell
at

found
full
and
adequate
confirmation
of
de

in

diggings
at

admitted
the
correctness
of
de
views
in
the
preface
to
his
volume
diospolis

published
three
years
later
in
the
preface
to
the
first
volume
of
de
book
contained
a
generous
recognition
of
the
method
and
general
accuracy
of
excavations
which
contrasted
favourably
according
to
de
morgan
with
the
excavations
of
others
generally
carried
on
without
scientific
control
and
with
the
sole
aim
of
obtaining
antiquities
or
literary
texts
that
de
own
work
was
carried
out
as
scientifically
and
as
carefully
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
his
conclusions
as
to
the
chronological
position
of
the
prehistoric
antiquities
have
been
shown
to
be
correct
to
describe

another
most
important
british
excavation
was
that
carried
on
by
and
wilkin
at
the
imposing
promontory
of
stands
out
into
the
plain
on
the
west
bank
of
the
nile
about
five
miles
south
of
abydos
at
the
foot
of
this
hill
de
morgan
found
a
very
extensive
prehistoric
necropolis
which
he
examined
but
did
not
excavate
to
any
great
extent
and
the
work
of
thoroughly
excavating
it
was
performed
by
and
wilkin
for
the
egypt
exploration
fund
the
results
have
thrown
very
great
light
upon
the
prehistoric
culture
of
egypt
and
burials
of
all
prehistoric
types
some
of
them
previously
unobserved
were
found
among
the
most
interesting
are
burials
in
pots
which
have
also
been
found
by
garstang
in
a
predynastic
necropolis
at
ragagna
north
of
abydos
one
of
the
more
remarkable
observations
made
at
was
the
progressive
development
of
the
tombs
from
the
simplest
to
a
small
brick
chamber
the
embryo
of
the
brick
tombs
of
the
ist
dynasty
among
the
objects
recovered
from
this
site
may
be
mentioned
a
pottery
model
of
oxen
a
box
in
the
shape
of
a
model
hut
and
a
slate
with
what
is
perhaps
the
oldest
egyptian
hieroglyph
known
a
representation
of
the
of
the
god
min
in

all
these
are
preserved
in

the

of
the
bodies
found
were
carefully
preserved
for

examination

an
extensive
prehistoric
cemetery

being
excavated
by

and

at
opposite

been

by

of
the

of
the

at
the
cemetery
of
is
of
the
usual
prehistoric
type
with
its
multitudes
of
small
oval
graves
excavated
just
a
little
way
below
the
surface
graves
of
this
kind
are
the
most
primitive
of
all
those
at
are
usually
more
developed
often
as
has
been
noted
rising
to
the
height
of
regular
brick
tombs
they
are
evidently
later
nearer
to
the
time
of
the
ist
dynasty
the
position
of
the
cemetery
is
also
characteristic
it
lies
on
the
usual
low
ridge
at
the
entrance
to
a
desert
which
is
itself
one
of
the
most
picturesque
in
this
part
of
egypt
with
its
chaos
of
great
boulders
and
fallen
rocks

liberality
reisner
has
therefore
been
able
to
keep
an
absolutely
complete
photographic
record
of
everything
even
down
to
the
successive
stages
in
the
opening
of
a
tomb
which
will
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
science
when
published
for
a
detailed
study
of
the
antiquities
of
the
prehistoric
period
the
publications
of
petrie
quibell
and
are
more
useful
than
that
of
de
morgan
who
does
not
give
enough
details
every
atom
of
evidence
is
given
in
the
publications
of
the
british
explorers
whereas
it
is
a
characteristic
of
french
work
to
give
brilliant
conclusions
beautifully
illustrated
without
much
of
the
evidence
on
which
the
conclusions
are
based
this
kind
of
work
does
not
appeal
to
the
mind
which
takes
nothing
on
trust
even
from
the
most
renowned
experts
and
always
wants
to
know
the
why
and
wherefore
the
complete
publication
of
evidence
which
marks
the
british
work
will
no
doubt
be
met
with
if
possible
in
even
more
complete

an
englishman
for

the
question
of
speedy
versus
delayed
publication
is
a
very
vexing
one
petrie
prefers
to
publish
as
speedily
as
possible
six
months
after
the
work
in
egypt
is
done
the
full
publication
with
photographs
of
everything
appears
reisner
and
the
french
explorers
prefer
to
publish
nothing
until
they
have
exhaustively
studied
the
whole
of
the
evidence
and
can
extract
nothing
more
from
it
this
would
be
admirable
if
the
french
published
their
discoveries
fully
but
they
do
not
even
de
morgan
has
not
approached
the
fulness
of
detail
which
characterizes
british
work
and
which
will
characterize
publication
when
it
appears
the
only
drawback
to
this
method
is
that
general
interest
in
the
particular
excavations
described
tends
to
pass
away
before
the
full
description
appears
petrie
has
explored
other
prehistoric
sites
at
abadiya
and
quibell
at
de
morgan
and
his
assistants
have
examined
a
large
number
of
sites
ranging
from
the
delta
to
further
research
has
shown
that
some
of
the
sites
identified
by
de
morgan
as
prehistoric
are
in
reality
of
much
later
date
for
example
kahun
where
the
late
flints
of
xiith
dynasty
date
were
found
he
notes
that
numbers
of
neolithic
flint
weapons
are
found
in
the
desert
on
the
borders
of
the
fayyum
and
at
helwan
south
of
cairo
and
that
all
the
important
necropoles
and
of
the
predynastic
people
are
to
be
found
in
the
districts
of
abydos
and
thebes
from
in
the
north
to
in
the
south
it
is
of
course
too
soon
to
assert
with
confidence
that
there
are
no
prehistoric
remains
in
any
other
part
of
egypt
especially
in
the
long
tract
between
the
fayyûm
and
the
district
of
abydos
but
up
to
the
present
time
none
have
been
found
in
this
region
this
geographical
distribution
of
the
prehistoric
remains
fits
in
curiously
with
the
ancient
legend
concerning
the
origin
of
the
ancestors
of
the
egyptians
in
upper
egypt
and
supports
the
much
discussed
theory
that
they
came
originally
to
the
nile
valley
from
the
shores
of
the
red
sea
by
way
of
the
wadi
hammamat
which
debouches
on
to
the
nile
in
the
vicinity
of
koptos
and
kus
opposite
ballas
and
tûkh
the
supposition
seems
a
very
probable
one
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
earliest
egyptians
entered
the
valley
of
the
nile
by
the
route
suggested
and
then
spread
northwards
and
southwards
in
the
valley
the
fact
that
their
remains
are
not
found
north
of
nor
south
of
might
perhaps
be
explained
by
the
supposition
that
when
they
had
extended
thus
far
north
and
south
from
their
original
place
of
arrival
they
passed
from
the
primitive
neolithic
condition
to
the
more
highly
developed
culture
of
the
period
which
immediately
preceded
the
establishment
of
the
monarchy
the
neolithic
weapons
of
the
fayyûm
and
would
then
be
the
remains
of
a
different
people
which
inhabited
the
delta
and
middle
egypt
in
very
early
times
this
people
may
have
been
of
mediterranean
stock
akin
to
the
primitive
inhabitants
of
palestine
greece
italy
and
spain
and
they
no
doubt
were
identical
with
the
inhabitants
of
lower
egypt
who
were
overthrown
and
conquered
by
and
the
other
southern
founders
of
the
monarchy
who
belonged
to
the
race
which
had
come
from
the
red
sea
by
the
wadi
hammamat
and
so
were
the
ancestors
of
the
later
natives
of
lower
egypt
whether
the
southerners
whose
primitive
remains
we
find
from
to
were
of
the
same
race
as
the
northerners
whom
they
conquered
can
not
be
decided
the
of
the
southerners
agrees
with
that
of
the
mediterranean
races
but
we
have
no
nécropoles
of
the
northerners
to
tell
us
much
of
their
peculiarities
we
have
nothing
but
their
flint
arrowheads
but
it
should
be
observed
that
in
spite
of
the
present
absence
of
all
primitive
remains
whether
mere
flints
or
actual
graves
with
bodies
and
relics
of
the
primeval
population
between
the
fayyûm
and
there
is
no
proof
that
the
primitive
race
of
upper
egypt
was
not
coterminous
and
identical
with
that
of
the
lower
country
it
might
therefore
be
urged
that
the
whole
neolithic
population
was
by
its
and
and
specifically
indigenous
egyptian
in
its
this
is
quite
possible
but
we
have
again
to
account
for
the
legends
of
distant
origin
on
the
red
sea
coast
the
probability
that
one
element
of
the
egyptian
population
was
of
extraneous
origin
and
came
from
the
east
into
the
nile
valley
near
koptos
and
finally
the
historical
fact
of
an
advance
of
the
early
dynastic
egyptians
from
the
south
to
the
conquest
of
the
north
the
latter
fact
might
of
course
be
explained
as
a
civil
war
analogous
to
that
between
thebes
and
asyût
in
the
time
of
the
ixth
dynasty
but
against
this
explanation
is
to
be
set
the
fact
that
the
contemporary
monuments
of
the
southerners
exhibit
the
men
of
the
north
as
of
foreign
and
ethnic
type
resembling
libyans
it
is
possible
that
they
were
akin
to
the
libyans
and
this
would
square
very
well
with
the
first
theory
but
it
may
also
be
made
to
fit
in
with
a
development
of
the
second
which
has
been
generally
accepted
according
to
this
view
the
whole
primitive
neolithic
population
of
north
and
south
was
miotic
indigenous
in
origin
and
akin
to
the
sergi
and
the
other
ethnologists
it
was
not
this
population
the
whose
nécropoles
have
been
found
by
de
morgan
pétrie
and
maclver
that
entered
the
nile
valley
by
the
wadi
hammamat
this
was
another
race
of
different
ethnic
origin
which
came
from
the
red
sea
toward
the
end
of
the
neolithic
period
and
being
of
higher
civilization
than
the
native
nilotes
assumed
the
lordship
over
them
gave
a
great
impetus
to
the
development
of
their
culture
and
started
at
once
the
institution
of
monarchy
the
knowledge
of
letters
and
the
use
of
metals
the
chiefs
of
this
superior
tribe
founded
the
monarchy
conquered
the
north
unified
the
kingdom
and
began
egyptian
history
from
many
indications
it
would
seem
probable
that
these
conquerors
were
of
babylonian
origin
or
that
the
culture
they
brought
with
them
possibly
from
arabia
was
ultimately
of
babylonian
origin
they
themselves
would
seem
to
have
been
semites
or
rather
who
came
from
arabia
to
africa
by
way
of
the
straits
of
bab
and
proceeded
up
the
coast
to
about
the
neighbourhood
of
kusêr
whence
the
wadi
hammamat
offered
them
an
open
road
to
the
valley
of
the
nile
by
this
route
they
may
have
entered
egypt
bringing
with
them
a
civilization
which
like
that
of
the
other
semites
had
been
profoundly
influenced
and
modified
by
that
of
the
sumerian
inhabitants
of
babylonia
this
culture
mingling
with
that
of
the
nilotes
themselves
produced
the
civilization
of
ancient
egypt
as
we
know
it
this
is
a
very
plausible
hypothesis
and
has
a
great
deal
of
evidence
in
its
favour
it
seems
certain
that
in
the
early
dynastic
period
two
races
lived
in
egypt
which
differed
considerably
in
type
and
also
apparently
in
burial
customs
the
later
egyptians
always
buried
the
dead
lying
on
their
backs
extended
at
full
length
during
the
period
of
the
middle
kingdom
dynasties
the
head
was
usually
turned
over
on
to
the
left
side
in
order
that
the
dead
man
might
look
through
the
two
great
eyes
painted
on
that
side
of
the
coffin
afterward
the
rigidly
extended
position
was
always
adopted
the
neolithic
egyptians
however
buried
the
dead
lying
wholly
on
the
left
side
and
in
a
contracted
position
with
the
knees
drawn
up
to
the
chin
the
bodies
were
not
embalmed
and
the
extended
position
and
mummification
were
never
used
under
the
ivth
dynasty
we
find
in
the
necropolis
of
mêdûm
north
of
the
payyûm
the
two
positions
used
simultaneously
and
the
extended
bodies
are
mummified
the
contracted
bodies
are
skeletons
as
in
the
case
of
most
of
the
predynastic
bodies
when
these
are
found
with
flesh
skin
and
hair
intact
their
preservation
is
due
to
the
dryness
of
the
soil
and
the
preservative
salts
it
contains
not
to
intentional
embalming
which
was
evidently
introduced
by
those
who
employed
the
extended
position
in
burial
the
contracted
position
is
found
as
late
as
the
vth
dynasty
at
dashasha
south
of
the
eayyûm
but
after
that
date
it
is
no
longer
found
the
conclusion
is
obvious
that
the
contracted
position
without
mummification
which
the
neolithic
people
used
was
supplanted
in
the
early
dynastic
period
by
the
extended
position
with
mummification
and
by
the
time
of
the
vith
dynasty
it
was
entirely
superseded
this
points
to
the
supersession
of
the
burial
customs
of
the
indigenous
neolithic
race
by
those
of
another
race
which
conquered
and
dominated
the
indigenes
and
since
the
extended
burials
of
the
ivth
dynasty
are
evidently
those
of
the
higher
nobles
while
the
contracted
ones
are
those
of
inferior
people
it
is
probable
that
the
customs
of
extended
burial
and
embalming
were
introduced
by
a
foreign
race
which
founded
the
egyptian
monarchical
state
with
its
hierarchy
of
nobles
and
officials
and
in
fact
started
egyptian
civilization
on
its
way
the
conquerors
of
the
north
were
thus
not
the
descendants
of
the
neolithic
people
of
the
south
but
their
conquerors
in
fact
they
dominated
the
indigenes
both
of
north
and
south
who
will
then
appear
since
we
find
the
custom
of
contracted
burial
in
the
north
at
dashasha
and
mêdûm
to
have
originally
belonged
to
the
same
race
the
conquering
race
is
that
which
is
supposed
to
have
been
of
semitic
or
origin
and
to
have
brought
elements
of
sumerian
culture
to
savage
egypt
the
reasons
advanced
for
this
supposition
are
the
following
just
as
the
egyptian
race
was
evidently
compounded
of
two
elements
of
conquered
and
conquering
x
so
the
egyptian
language
is
evidently
compounded
of
two
elements
the
one
nilotic
perhaps
related
in
some
degree
to
the
berber
dialects
of
north
africa
the
other
not
x
but
evidently
semitic
certain
elements
of
the
early
dynastic
civilization
which
do
not
appear
in
that
of
the
earlier
period
resemble
elements
of
the
civilization
of
babylonia
we
may
instance
the
use
of
the
which
died
out
in
egypt
in
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
but
was
always
used
in
babylonia
from
the
earliest
to
the
latest
times
the
early
egyptian
is
of
exactly
the
same
type
as
the
early
babylonian
one
in
the
british
museum
is
an
egyptian
of
red
breccia
which
is
identical
in
shape
and
size
with
one
from
babylonia
also
in
the
museum
bearing
the
name
of
sargon
king
of
agade
one
of
the
earliest
chaldæan
monarchs
who
must
have
lived
about
the
same
time
as
the
egyptian
kings
of
the
dynasties
to
which
period
the
egyptian
may
also
be
approximately
assigned
the
egyptian
art
of
the
earliest
dynasties
bears
again
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
that
of
early
babylonia
it
is
not
till
the
time
of
the
iid
dynasty
that
egyptian
art
begins
to
take
upon
itself
the
regular
form
which
we
know
so
well
and
not
till
that
of
the
ivth
that
this
form
was
finally
crystallized
under
the
dynasty
we
find
the
figure
of
man
or
to
take
other
instances
that
of
a
lion
or
a
hawk
or
a
snake
often
treated
in
a
style
very
different
from
that
in
which
we
are
accustomed
to
see
a
man
a
lion
a
hawk
or
a
snake
depicted
in
works
of
the
later
period
and
the
striking
thing
is
that
these
early
representations
which
differ
so
much
from
what
we
find
in
later
egyptian
art
curiously
resemble
the
works
of
early
babylonian
art
of
the
time
of
the
patesis
of
shirpurla
or
the
kings
and
one
of
the
best
known
relics
of
the
early
art
of
babylonia
is
the
famous
of
now
in
paris
on
this
we
see
the
enemies
of
eannadu
one
of
the
early
rulers
of
shirpurla
cast
out
to
be
devoured
by
the
vultures
on
an
egyptian
relief
of
slate
evidently
originally
dedicated
in
a
temple
record
of
some
historical
event
and
dating
from
the
beginning
of
the
ist
dynasty
practically
contemporary
according
to
our
latest
knowledge
with
eannadu
we
have
an
almost
exactly
similar
scene
of
captives
being
cast
out
into
the
desert
and
devoured
by
lions
and
vultures
the
two
reliefs
are
curiously
alike
in
their
clumsy
naïve
style
of
art
a
further
point
is
that
the
official
represented
on
the
stele
who
appears
to
be
thrusting
one
of
the
bound
captives
out
to
die
wears
a
long
fringed
garment
of
babylonish
cut
quite
different
from
the
clothes
of
the
later
egyptians
there
are
evidently
two
distinct
and
different
main
strata
in
the
fabric
of
egyptian
religion
on
the
one
hand
we
find
a
mass
of
myth
and
religious
belief
of
very
primitive
almost
savage
cast
combining
a
worship
of
the
actual
dead
in
their
tombs
which
were
supposed
to
communicate
and
thus
form
a
veritable
or
rather
with
veneration
of
magic
animals
such
as
jackals
cats
hawks
and
crocodiles
on
the
other
hand
we
have
a
sun
and
sky
worship
of
a
more
elevated
nature
which
does
not
seem
to
have
amalgamated
with
the
earlier
fetishism
and
until
a
comparatively
late
period
the
main
seats
of
the
were
at
heliopolis
in
the
delta
and
at
edfu
in
upper
egypt
heliopolis
seems
always
to
have
been
a
centre
of
light
and
leading
in
egypt
and
it
is
as
is
well
known
the
on
of
the
bible
at
whose
university
the
jewish
lawgiver
moses
is
related
to
have
been
educated
all
the
wisdom
of
the
the
philosophical
theories
of
the
priests
of
the
and
turn
at
heliopolis
seem
to
have
been
the
source
from
which
sprang
the
monotheistic
heresy
of
the
in
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
who
under
the
guidance
of
the
reforming
king
akhunaten
worshipped
only
the
disk
of
the
sun
as
the
source
of
all
life
the
door
in
heaven
so
to
speak
through
which
the
hidden
one
deity
poured
forth
heat
and
light
the
origin
of
life
upon
the
earth
very
early
in
egyptian
history
the
heliopolitans
gained
the
upper
hand
and
the
under
the
vth
dynasty
the
apogee
of
the
old
kingdom
came
to
the
front
and
for
the
first
time
the
kings
took
the
afterwards
royal
title
of
of
the
it
appears
then
as
a
more
or
less
foreign
importation
into
the
nile
valley
and
bears
most
undoubtedly
a
semitic
impress
its
two
chief
seats
were
situated
the
one
heliopolis
in
the
north
on
the
eastern
edge
of
the
delta
just
where
an
early
semitic
settlement
from
over
the
desert
might
be
expected
to
be
found
the
other
edfu
in
the
upper
egyptian
territory
south
of
the
thebaïd
koptos
and
the
wadi
and
close
to
the
chief
settlement
of
the
earliest
kings
and
the
most
ancient
capital
of
upper
egypt
the
custom
of
burying
at
full
length
was
evidently
introduced
into
egypt
by
the
second
or
x
race
the
neolithic
egyptians
buried
in
the
cramped
position
the
early
babylonians
buried
at
full
length
as
far
as
we
know
on
the
same
of
vultures
which
has
already
been
mentioned
we
see
the
burying
at
full
length
of
dead
warriors
see
illustration
there
is
no
trace
of
any
burial
in
babylonia
in
the
cramped
position
the
tombs
at
warka
erech
with
cramped
bodies
in
pottery
coffins
are
of
very
late
date
a
further
point
arises
with
regard
to
embalming
the
neolithic
egyptians
did
not
embalm
the
dead
usually
their
cramped
bodies
are
found
as
skeletons
when
they
are
mummified
it
is
merely
owing
to
the
preservative
action
of
the
salt
in
the
soil
not
to
any
process
of
embalming
the
second
or
x
race
however
evidently
introduced
the
custom
of
embalming
as
well
as
that
of
burial
at
full
length
and
the
use
of
coffins
the
neolithic
egyptian
used
no
box
or
coffin
the
nearest
approach
to
this
being
a
pot
which
was
inverted
over
the
coiled
up
body
usually
only
a
mat
was
put
over
the
body
illustration
portion
of
the
of
found
at
telloh
illustration
now
it
is
evident
that
babylonians
and
assyrians
who
buried
the
dead
at
full
length
in
chests
had
some
knowledge
of
embalming
an
assyrian
king
tells
us
how
he
buried
his
royal
father
the
grave
the
secret
place
in
kingly
oil
i
gently
laid
him
the
marketh
his
with
mighty
bronze
i
sealed
its
entrance
and
i
protected
it
with
an
the
was
evidently
used
with
the
idea
of
preserving
the
body
from
decay
salt
also
was
used
to
preserve
the
dead
and
herodotus
says
that
the
babylonians
buried
in
honey
which
was
also
used
by
the
egyptians
no
doubt
the
babylonian
method
was
less
perfect
than
the
egyptian
but
the
comparison
is
an
interesting
one
when
taken
in
connection
with
the
other
points
of
resemblance
mentioned
above
we
find
then
that
an
analysis
of
the
egyptian
language
reveals
a
semitic
element
in
it
that
the
early
dynastic
culture
had
certain
characteristics
which
were
unknown
to
the
neolithic
egyptians
but
are
closely
parallelled
in
early
babylonia
that
there
were
two
elements
in
the
egyptian
religion
one
of
which
seems
to
have
originally
belonged
to
the
neolithic
people
while
the
other
has
a
semitic
appearance
and
that
there
were
two
sets
of
burial
customs
in
early
egypt
one
that
of
the
neolithic
people
the
other
evidently
that
of
a
conquering
race
which
eventually
prevailed
over
the
former
these
later
rites
were
analogous
to
those
of
the
babylonians
and
assyrians
though
differing
from
them
in
points
of
detail
the
conclusion
is
that
the
x
or
conquering
race
was
semitic
and
brought
to
egypt
the
semitic
elements
in
the
egyptian
religion
and
a
culture
originally
derived
from
that
of
the
sumerian
inhabitants
of
babylonia
the
parent
of
all
semitic
civilizations
the
question
now
arises
how
did
this
semitic
people
reach
egypt
we
have
the
choice
of
two
points
of
entry
first
heliopolis
in
the
north
where
the
semitic
took
root
and
second
the
wadi
in
the
south
north
of
edfu
the
southern
centre
of
and
hierakonpolis
the
capital
of
the
upper
egyptian
kingdom
which
existed
before
the
foundation
of
the
monarchy
the
legends
which
seem
to
bring
the
ancestors
of
the
egyptians
from
the
red
sea
coast
have
already
been
mentioned
they
are
closely
connected
with
the
worship
of
the
sky
and
sun
god
horus
of
edfu
hathor
his
nurse
the
of
horus
the
centre
of
whose
worship
was
at
dendera
immediately
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
wadi
hammamat
was
said
to
have
come
from
holy
land
abyssinia
or
the
red
sea
coast
with
the
company
or
of
the
gods
now
the
egyptians
always
seem
to
have
had
some
idea
that
they
were
connected
racially
with
the
inhabitants
of
the
land
of
punt
or
puenet
the
modern
abyssinia
and
somaliland
in
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
they
depicted
the
inhabitants
of
punt
as
greatly
resembling
themselves
in
form
feature
and
dress
and
as
wearing
the
little
beard
which
was
worn
by
the
egyptians
of
the
earliest
times
but
even
as
early
as
the
ivth
dynasty
was
reserved
for
the
gods
further
the
word
is
always
written
without
the
hieroglyph
determinative
of
a
foreign
country
thus
showing
that
the
egyptians
did
not
regard
the
punites
as
foreigners
this
certainly
looks
as
if
the
punites
were
a
portion
of
the
great
migration
from
arabia
left
behind
on
the
african
shore
when
the
rest
of
the
wandering
people
pressed
on
northwards
to
the
wadi
hammamat
and
the
nile
it
may
be
that
the
modern
gallas
and
abyssinians
are
descendants
of
these
punites
now
the
of
edfu
is
in
legend
a
conquering
hero
who
advances
down
the
nile
valley
with
his
or
to
overthrow
the
people
of
the
north
whom
he
defeats
in
a
great
battle
near
dendera
this
may
be
a
reminiscence
of
the
first
fights
of
the
invaders
with
the
neolithic
inhabitants
the
other
form
of
horus
son
of
isis
has
also
a
body
of
retainers
the
or
of
horns
who
are
spoken
of
in
late
texts
as
the
rulers
of
egypt
before
the
monarchy
they
evidently
correspond
to
the
dynasties
of
illustration
or
of
manetho
and
are
probably
intended
for
the
early
kings
of
hierakonpolis
the
mention
of
the
followers
of
horus
as
is
very
interesting
for
it
would
appear
to
show
that
the
semitic
conquerors
were
notable
as
that
in
fact
their
conquest
was
that
old
story
in
the
dawn
of
the
history
the
utter
overthrow
and
subjection
of
the
by
the
the
primeval
tragedy
of
the
supersession
of
flint
by
copper
this
may
be
but
if
the
were
the
semitic
conquerors
who
founded
the
kingdom
it
would
appear
that
the
use
of
copper
was
known
in
egypt
to
some
extent
before
their
arrival
for
we
find
it
in
the
graves
of
the
late
neolithic
egyptians
very
sparsely
from
to
but
afterwards
more
commonly
it
was
evidently
becoming
known
the
supposition
however
that
the
were
the
semitic
conquerors
and
that
they
won
their
way
by
the
aid
of
their
superior
weapons
of
metal
may
be
provisionally
accepted
in
favour
of
the
view
which
would
bring
the
conquerors
by
way
of
the
wadi
hammamat
an
interesting
discovery
may
be
quoted
immediately
opposite
where
according
to
the
legend
the
battle
between
the
and
the
aborigines
took
place
lies
koptos
at
the
mouth
of
the
wadi
hammamat
here
in
underneath
the
pavement
of
the
ancient
temple
petrie
found
remains
which
he
then
diagnosed
as
belonging
to
the
most
ancient
epoch
of
egyptian
history
among
them
were
some
extremely
archaic
statues
of
the
god
min
on
which
were
curious
scratched
drawings
of
bears
elephants
walking
over
hills
of
the
most
primitive
description
with
them
were
heads
and
birds
of
a
style
then
unknown
but
which
we
now
know
to
belong
to
the
period
of
the
beginning
of
the
ist
dynasty
but
the
statues
of
min
are
older
the
belong
to
the
red
sea
are
we
to
see
in
these
statues
the
holy
images
of
the
conquerors
from
the
red
sea
who
reached
the
nile
valley
by
way
of
the
wadi
hammamat
and
set
up
the
first
memorials
of
their
presence
at
koptos
it
may
be
so
or
the
min
statues
may
be
older
than
the
conquerors
and
belong
to
the
neolithic
race
since
min
and
his
fetish
which
we
find
on
the
slate
palette
from
already
mentioned
seem
to
belong
to
the
indigenous
nilotes
in
any
case
we
have
in
these
statues
two
of
which
are
in
the
ashmolean
museum
at
oxford
probably
the
most
ancient
in
the
world
this
theory
which
would
make
all
the
neolithic
inhabitants
of
egypt
one
people
who
were
conquered
by
a
semitic
race
bringing
a
culture
of
sumerian
origin
to
egypt
by
way
of
the
wadi
hammamat
is
that
generally
accepted
at
the
present
time
it
may
however
eventually
prove
necessary
to
modify
it
for
reasons
given
above
it
may
well
be
that
the
neolithic
population
was
itself
not
indigenous
and
that
it
reached
the
nile
valley
by
way
of
the
wadi
hammamat
spreading
north
and
south
from
the
mouth
of
the
it
may
also
be
considered
probable
that
a
semitic
wave
invaded
egypt
by
way
of
the
isthmus
of
suez
where
the
early
of
heliopolis
probably
marks
a
primeval
semitic
settlement
in
that
case
it
would
seem
that
the
or
who
introduced
the
use
of
metal
would
have
to
be
referred
to
the
originally
neolithic
people
who
certainly
were
acquainted
with
the
use
of
copper
though
not
to
any
great
extent
but
this
is
not
a
necessary
supposition
the
are
closely
connected
with
the
horus
who
was
possibly
of
semitic
origin
and
another
semitic
wave
quite
distinct
from
that
which
entered
egypt
by
way
of
the
isthmus
may
very
well
also
have
reached
egypt
by
the
wadi
hammamat
or
equally
possibly
from
the
far
south
coming
down
to
the
nile
from
the
abyssinian
mountains
the
legend
of
the
coming
of
hathor
from
may
refer
to
some
such
wandering
and
we
know
that
the
egyptians
of
the
old
kingdom
communicated
with
the
land
of
punt
not
by
way
of
the
red
sea
coast
as
hatshepsut
did
but
by
way
of
the
upper
nile
this
would
tally
well
with
the
march
of
the
northwards
from
edfu
to
their
battle
with
the
forces
of
set
at
dendera
in
any
case
at
the
dawn
of
connected
egyptian
history
we
find
two
main
centres
of
civilization
in
egypt
heliopolis
and
buto
in
the
delta
in
the
north
and
edfu
and
hierakonpolis
in
the
south
here
were
established
at
the
beginning
of
the
chalcolithic
stage
of
culture
we
may
say
two
kingdoms
of
lower
and
upper
egypt
which
were
eventually
united
by
the
superior
arms
of
the
kings
of
upper
egypt
who
imposed
their
rule
upon
the
north
but
at
the
same
time
removed
their
capital
thither
the
dualism
of
buto
and
hierakonpolis
really
lasted
throughout
egyptian
history
the
king
was
always
called
of
the
two
lands
and
wore
the
crowns
of
upper
and
lower
egypt
the
snakes
of
buto
and
nekhebet
the
goddess
of
nekheb
opposite
nekhen
or
hierakonpolis
always
typified
the
united
kingdom
this
dualism
of
course
often
led
to
actual
division
and
reversion
to
the
predynastic
order
of
things
as
for
instance
in
the
time
of
the
xxist
dynasty
it
might
well
seem
that
both
the
impulses
to
culture
development
in
the
north
and
south
came
from
semitic
inspiration
and
that
it
was
to
the
semitic
invaders
in
north
and
south
that
the
founding
of
the
two
kingdoms
was
due
this
may
be
true
to
some
extent
but
it
is
at
the
same
time
very
probable
that
the
first
development
of
political
culture
at
hierakonpolis
was
really
of
origin
the
kingdom
of
buto
since
its
capital
is
situated
so
near
to
the
seacoast
may
have
owed
its
origin
to
oversea
mediterranean
connections
there
is
much
in
the
political
constitution
of
later
egypt
which
seems
to
have
been
of
indigenous
and
origin
especially
does
this
seem
to
be
so
in
the
case
of
the
division
and
organization
of
the
country
into
nomes
it
is
obvious
that
so
soon
as
agriculture
began
to
be
practised
on
a
large
scale
boundaries
would
be
formed
and
in
the
unique
conditions
of
egypt
where
all
boundaries
disappear
beneath
the
inundation
every
year
it
is
evident
that
the
fixing
of
as
permanently
as
possible
by
means
of
landmarks
was
early
essayed
we
can
therefore
with
confidence
assign
the
formation
of
the
nomes
to
very
early
times
now
the
names
of
the
nomes
and
the
symbols
or
emblems
by
which
they
were
distinguished
are
of
very
great
interest
in
this
connection
they
are
nearly
all
figures
of
the
magic
animals
of
the
primitive
religion
and
of
the
older
deities
the
names
are
in
fact
those
of
the
territories
of
the
neolithic
egyptian
tribes
and
their
emblems
are
those
of
the
protecting
tribal
demons
the
political
divisions
of
the
country
seem
then
to
be
of
extremely
ancient
origin
and
if
the
nomes
go
back
to
a
time
before
the
semitic
invasions
so
may
also
the
kingdoms
of
the
south
and
north
of
these
predynastic
kingdoms
we
know
very
little
except
from
legendary
sources
the
northerners
who
were
conquered
by
aha
narmer
and
khâsekhehiui
do
not
look
very
much
like
egyptians
but
rather
resemble
semites
or
libyans

currelly
attempted
to
excavate
at
buto
in
order
to
find
traces
of
the
predynastic
kingdom
but
owing
to
the
infiltration
of
water
his
efforts
were
unsuccessful
it
is
improbable
that
anything
is
now
left
of
the
most
ancient
period
at
that
site
as
the
conditions
in
the
delta
are
so
very
different
from
those
obtaining
in
upper
egypt
there
at
hierakonpolis
and
at
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
nile
the
sites
of
the
ancient
cities
nekhen
and
nekheb
the
excavators
have
been
very
successful
the
work
was
carried
out
by
quibell
and
green
in
the
years
prehistoric
burials
were
found
on
the
hills
near
by
but
the
larger
portion
of
the
antiquities
were
recovered
from
the
and
date
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
dynasty
exactly
the
time
when
the
kings
of
hierakonpolis
first
conquered
the
kingdom
of
buto
and
founded
the
united
egyptian
monarchy
the
ancient
temple
which
was
probably
one
of
the
earliest
seats
of
egyptian
civilization
was
situated
on
a
mound
now
known
as
red
hill
from
its
colour
the
chief
feature
of
the
most
ancient
temple
seems
to
have
been
a
circular
mound
revetted
by
a
wall
of
sandstone
blocks
which
was
apparently
erected
about
the
end
of
the
predynastic
period
upon
this
a
shrine
was
probably
erected
this
was
the
ancient
shrine
of
nekhen
the
cradle
of
the
egyptian
monarchy
close
by
it
were
found
some
of
the
most
valuable
relics
of
the
earliest
pharaonic
age
the
great
ceremonial
and
vases
of
narmer
and
scorpion
the
shields
or
of
the
same
narmer
the
vases
and
stelas
of
khâsekhemui
and
of
later
date
the
splendid
copper
colossal
group
of
king
pepi
i
and
his
son
which
is
now
at
cairo
most
of
the
dynasty
objects
are
preserved
in
the
museum
at
oxford
which
is
one
of
the
best
centres
for
the
study
of
early
egyptian
antiquities
narmer
and
khâsekhemui
are
as
we
shall
see
two
of
the
first
monarchs
of
all
egypt
these
sculptured
and
inscribed
shields
are
monuments
dedicated
by
them
in
the
ancestral
shrine
at
hierakonpolis
as
records
of
their
deeds
both
kings
seem
to
have
waged
war
against
the
northerners
the
of
heliopolis
and
the
delta
and
on
these
votive
monuments
from
hierakonpolis
we
find
hieroglyphed
records
of
the
defeat
of
the
who
have
very
definitely
semitic
physiognomies
on
one
shield
or
palette
we
see
narmer
clubbing
a
man
of
semitic
appearance
who
is
called
the
one
of
the
delta
while
below
two
other
semites
fly
seeking
above
is
a
figure
of
a
hawk
symbolizing
the
upper
egyptian
king
holding
a
rope
which
is
passed
through
the
nose
of
a
semitic
head
while
behind
is
a
sign
which
may
be
read
as
north
so
that
the
whole
symbolizes
the
leading
away
of
the
north
into
captivity
by
the
king
of
the
south
it
is
significant
in
view
of
what
has
been
said
above
with
regard
to
the
probable
semitic
origin
of
the
heliopolitan
northerners
to
find
the
people
typical
of
the
represented
by
the
southerners
as
semites
equally
semitic
is
the
overthrown
northerner
on
the
other
side
of
this
monument
which
we
are
describing
he
is
being
trampled
under
the
hoofs
and
gored
by
the
horns
of
a
bull
who
like
the
hawk
symbolizes
the
king
the
royal
bull
has
broken
down
the
wall
of
a
fortified
enclosure
in
which
is
the
hut
or
tent
of
the
semite
and
the
bricks
lie
about
promiscuously
in
connection
with
the
semitic
origin
of
the
northerners
the
form
of
the
fortified
enclosures
on
both
sides
of
this
monument
that
to
whose
protection
the
two
semites
on
one
side
fly
and
that
out
of
which
the
kingly
bull
has
dragged
the
chief
on
the
other
is
noticeable
as
usual
in
egyptian
writing
the
hieroglyph
of
these
buildings
takes
the
form
of
a
plan
the
plan
shows
a
crenelated
enclosure
resembling
the
walls
of
a
great
babylonian
palace
or
temple
such
as
have
been
found
at
telloh
warka
or
mukayyar
the
same
design
is
found
in
egypt
at
the
shuret
an
old
kingdom
fortress
at
abydos
in
the
tomb
of
king
aha
at
nakâda
and
in
many
walls
of
of
the
early
time
this
is
another
argument
in
favour
of
an
early
connection
between
egypt
and
babylonia
we
illustrate
a
fragment
of
another
votive
shield
or
palette
of
the
same
kind
now
in
the
museum
of
the
louvre
which
probably
came
originally
from
hierakonpolis
it
is
of
exactly
similar
workmanship
to
that
of
narmer
and
is
no
doubt
a
fragment
of
another
monument
of
that
king
on
it
we
see
the
same
subject
of
the
overthrowing
of
a
northerner
of
semitic
aspect
by
the
royal
bull
on
one
side
below
is
a
fortified
enclosure
with
crenelated
walls
of
the
type
we
have
described
and
within
it
a
lion
and
a
vase
below
this
another
fort
and
a
bird
within
it
these
signs
may
express
the
names
of
the
two
forts
but
owing
to
the
fact
that
at
this
early
period
egyptian
orthography
was
not
yet
fixed
we
can
not
read
them
on
the
other
side
we
see
a
row
of
animated
of
upper
egypt
with
the
symbols
of
the
god
min
of
koptos
the
hawk
of
horus
of
edfu
the
ibis
of
thot
of
eshmunên
and
the
jackals
of
anubis
of
abydos
which
drag
a
rope
had
we
the
rest
of
the
monument
we
should
see
bound
at
the
end
of
the
rope
some
prisoner
king
or
animal
symbolic
of
the
north
on
another
slate
shield
which
we
also
reproduce
we
see
a
symbolical
representation
of
the
capture
of
seven
northern
cities
whose
names
seem
to
mean
the
men
the
the
the
and
the
cities
is
attacked
by
a
lion
by
a
hawk
by
two
hawk
and
another
whose
name
we
can
not
guess
at
is
being
opened
up
by
a
scorpion
illustration
left
obverse
of
a
slate

the
operating
animals
evidently
represent
nomes
and
tribes
of
the
upper
egyptians
here
again
we
see
the
same
crenelated
walls
of
the
northern
towns
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
slate
fragment
also
which
is
preserved
in
the
cairo
museum
is
a
monument
of
the
conquests
of
narmer
it
is
executed
in
the
same
archaic
style
as
those
from
hierakonpolis
the
animals
on
the
other
side
no
doubt
represent
part
of
the
spoil
of
the
north
returning
to
the
great
shield
or
palette
found
by
quibell
we
see
the
king
coming
out
followed
by
his
the
or
servant
to
view
the
dead
bodies
of
the
slain
northerners
which
lie
arranged
in
rows
decapitated
and
with
their
heads
between
their
feet
the
king
is
preceded
by
a
procession
of

right
above
the
dead
men
are
symbolic
representations
of
a
hawk
perched
on
a
harpoon
over
a
boat
and
a
hawk
and
a
door
which
doubtless
again
refer
to
the
fights
of
the
royal
hawk
of
upper
egypt
on
the
nile
and
at
the
gate
of
the
north
the
designs
on
the
refer
to
the
same
conquest
of
the
north
in
his
commentary
hierakonpolis
on
this
scene
petrie
supposes
that
the
star
sign
means
and
compares
the
star
for
king
in
the
star
of
the
cuneiform
script
does
not
mean
but
the
star
then
ought
to
mean
and
the
title
of
a
god
and
this
supposition
may
be
correct
servant
was
the
appellation
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
priest
in
later
days
and
was
then
spelt
with
the
ordinary
sign
for
a
god
the
picture
of
an
axe
but
in
the
archaic
period
with
which
we
are
dealing
a
star
like
the
babylonian
sign
may
very
well
have
been
used
for
and
the
title
of
may
read
he
was
the
slave
of
the
living
god
narmer
all
egyptian
kings
were
regarded
as
deities
more
or
less
the

khâsekhemui
a
king
show
us
that
he
conquered
the
north
also
and
slew
the
contorted
attitudes
of
the
dead
northerners
were
greatly
admired
and
sketched
at
the
time
and
were
reproduced
on
the
pedestal
of
the
statue
found
by
quibell
which
is
now
at
oxford
it
was
an
age
of
cheerful
savage
energy
like
most
times
when
kingdoms
and
peoples
are
in
the
making
about

the
date
of

khâsekhemui
probably
lived
later
than
narmer
and
we
may
suppose
that
his
conquest
was
in
reality
a
he
may
have
lived
as
late
as
the
time
of
the
iid
dynasty
whereas
narmer
must
be
placed
at
the
beginning
of
the
ist
and
his
conquest
was
probably
that
which
first
united
the
two
kingdoms
of
the
south
and
north
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
he
is
probably
one
of
the
originals
of
the
legendary
who
was
regarded
from
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
onwards
as
the
founder
of
the
kingdom
and
was
first
made
known
to
europe
by
herodotus
under
the
name
of

reverse

narmer

therefore
the

of

may
possibly
have
recovered
the
names
of
one
or
two
of
the
kings
anterior
to
narmer
in
the
excavations
at
abydos
see
chapter
ii
but
this
is
uncertain
to
all
intents
and
purposes
we
have
only
legendary
knowledge
of
the
southern
kingdom
until
its
close
when
narmer
the
mighty
went
forth
to
strike
down
the
anu
of
the

recorded

the
first
time
united
and
the
fortress
of
the

was
built
to
dominate

the

and
egyptian

began
illustration
chapter
ii
abydos
and
the
first
three
dynasties
until
the
recent
discoveries
had
been
made
which
have
thrown
so
much
light
upon
the
early
history
of
egypt
the
traditional
order
and
names
of
the
kings
of
the
first
three
egyptian
dynasties
were
in
default
of
more
accurate
information
retained
by
all
writers
on
the
history
of
the
period
the
names
were
taken
from
the
official
lists
of
kings
at
abydos
and
elsewhere
and
were
divided
into
dynasties
according
to
the
system
of
manetho
whose
names
agree
more
or
less
with
those
of
the
lists
and
were
evidently
derived
from
them
ultimately
with
regard
to
the
fourth
and
later
dynasties
it
was
clear
that
the
were
correct
as
their
evidence
agreed
entirely
with
that
of
the
contemporary
monuments
but
no
means
existed
of
checking
the
lists
of
the
first
three
dynasties
as
no
contemporary
monuments
other
than
a
ivth
dynasty
mention
of
a
iid
dynasty
king
send
had
been
found
the
lists
dated
from
the
time
of
the
xviiith
and
xixth
dynasties
so
that
it
was
very
possible
that
with
regard
to
the
earliest
dynasties
they
might
not
be
very
correct
this
conclusion
gained
additional
weight
from
the
fact
that
no
monuments
of
these
earliest
kings
were
ever
discovered
it
therefore
seemed
probable
that
they
were
purely
legendary
figures
in
whose
time
if
they
ever
did
exist
egypt
was
still
a
nation
the
jejune
stories
told
about
them
by
manetho
seemed
to
confirm
this
idea
mena
the
reputed
founder
of
the
monarchy
was
generally
regarded
as
a
historical
figure
owing
to
the
persistence
of
his
name
in
all
ancient
literary
accounts
of
the
beginnings
of
egyptian
history
for
it
was
but
natural
to
suppose
that
the
name
of
the
man
who
unified
egypt
and
founded
memphis
would
endure
in
the
mouths
of
the
people
but
with
regard
to
his
successors
no
such
supposition
seemed
probable
until
the
time
of
sneferu
and
the
this
was
the
critical
view
another
school
of
historians
accepted
all
the
kings
of
the
lists
as
historical
simply
because
the
egyptians
had
registered
their
names
as
kings
to
them
teta
ateth
and
ata
were
as
historical
as
mena
modern
discovery
has
altered
our
view
and
truth
is
seen
to
lie
between
the
opposing
schools
as
usual
the
kings
after
mena
do
not
seem
to
be
such
entirely
unhistorical
figures
as
the
extreme
critics
thought
the
names
of
several
of
them
merpeba
of
the
ist
dynasty
are
correctly
given
in
the
later
lists
and
those
of
others
were
simply
misread
that
of
semti
of
the
same
dynasty
misread
by
the
on
the
other
hand
mena
himself
has
become
a
somewhat
doubtful
quantity
the
real
names
of
most
of
the
early
monarchs
of
egypt
have
been
recovered
for
us
by
the
latest
excavations
and
we
can
now
see
when
the
of
the
xixth
dynasty
were
right
and
when
they
were
wrong
and
can
distinguish
what
is
legendary
in
their
work
from
what
is
really
historical
it
is
true
that
they
very
often
appear
to
have
been
wrong
but
on
the
other
hand
they
were
sometimes
unexpectedly
near
the
mark
and
the
general
number
and
arrangement
of
their
kings
seems
correct
so
that
we
can
still
go
to
them
for
assistance
in
the
arrangement
of
the
names
which
are
communicated
to
us
by
the
newly
discovered
monuments
help
too
need
never
be
despised
because
he
was
a
copyist
of
copyists
we
can
still
use
him
to
direct
our
investigations
and
his
arrangement
of
dynasties
must
still
remain
the
framework
of
our
chronological
scheme
though
he
does
not
seem
to
have
been
always
correct
as
to
the
places
in
which
the
dynasties
originated
more
than
the
names
of
the
kings
have
the
new
discoveries
communicated
to
us
they
have
shed
a
flood
of
light
on
the
beginnings
of
egyptian
civilization
and
art
supplementing
the
recently
ascertained
facts
concerning
the
prehistoric
age
which
have
been
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
the
impulse
to
these
discoveries
was
given
by
the
work
of
de
morgan
who
excavated
sites
of
the
early
dynastic
as
well
as
of
the
predynastic
age
among
these
was
a
great
at
nakâda
which
proved
to
be
that
of
a
very
early
king
who
bore
the
name
of
aha
the
walls
of
this
tomb
are
crenelated
like
those
of
the
early
babylonian
palaces
and
the
forts
of
the
northerners
already
referred
to
de
morgan
early
perceived
the
difference
between
the
neolithic
antiquities
and
those
of
the
later
archaic
period
of
egyptian
civilization
to
which
the
tomb
at
nakâda
belonged
in
the
second
volume
of
his
great
work
on
the
primitive
antiquities
of
egypt
des
métaux
et
lé
tombeau
royale
de
négadeh
he
described
the
antiquities
of
the
ist
dynasty
which
had
been
found
at
the
time
he
wrote
antiquities
of
the
same
primitive
period
and
even
of
an
earlier
date
had
been
discovered
by
flinders
petrie
as
has
already
been
said
at
koptos
at
the
mouth
of
the
wadi
hammamat
but
though
petrie
correctly
diagnosed
the
age
of
the
great
statues
of
the
god
min
which
he
found
he
was
led
by
his
misdating
of
the
antiquities
from
ballas
and
tûkh
also
to
misdate
several
of
the
primitive
antiquities
the
lions
and
hawks
for
instance
found
at
koptos
he
placed
in
the
period
between
the
viith
and
xth
dynasties
whereas
they
can
now
in
the
light
of
further
discoveries
at
abydos
be
seen
to
date
to
the
earlier
part
of
the
ist
dynasty
the
time
of
narmer
and
aha
it
is
these
discoveries
at
abydos
coupled
with
those
already
described
of
quibell
at
hierakonpolis
which
have
told
us
most
of
what
we
know
with
regard
to
the
history
of
the
first
three
dynasties
at
abydos
petrie
was
not
himself
the
first
in
the
field
the
site
having
already
been
partially
explored
by
a
french
egyptologist
amélineau
the
excavations
of
amélineau
were
however
perhaps
not
conducted
strictly
on
scientific
lines
and
his
results
have
been
insufficiently
published
with
very
few
photographs
so
that
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
we
are
unable
to
give
amélineau
the
full
credit
which
is
no
doubt
due
to
him
for
his
work
the
system
of
publications
has
been
often
and
with
justice
criticized
but
he
at
least
tells
us
every
year
what
he
has
been
doing
and
gives
us
photographs
of
everything
he
has
found
for
this
reason
the
discoveries
at
abydos
have
been
coupled
chiefly
with
the
name
of
petrie
while
that
of
amélineau
is
rarely
heard
in
connection
with
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
amélineau
first
excavated
the
necropolis
of
the
early
kings
at
abydos
and
discovered
most
of
the
tombs
afterwards
worked
over
by
petrie
and
mace
yet
most
of
the
important
scientific
results
are
due
to
the
later
explorers
who
were
the
first
to
attempt
a
classification
of
them
though
we
must
add
that
this
classification
has
not
been
entirely
accepted
by
the
scientific
world
the
necropolis
of
the
earliest
kings
of
egypt
is
situated
in
the
great
bay
in
the
hills
which
lies
behind
abydos
to
the
southwest
of
the
main
necropolis
here
at
holy
abydos
where
every
pious
egyptian
wished
to
rest
after
death
the
bodies
of
the
most
ancient
kings
were
buried
it
is
said
by
manetho
that
the
original
seat
of
their
dominion
was
this
a
town
in
the
vicinity
of
abydos
now
represented
by
the
modern
grîrga
which
lies
a
few
miles
distant
from
its
site
this
may
be
a
fact
but
we
have
as
yet
obtained
no
confirmation
of
it
it
may
well
be
that
the
attribution
of
a
thinite
origin
to
the
ist
and
iid
dynasties
was
due
simply
to
the
fact
that
the
kings
of
these
dynasties
were
buried
at
abydos
which
lay
within
the
thinite
nome
manetho
knew
that
they
were
buried
at
abydos
and
so
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
they
lived
there
also
and
called
them
illustration
camp
at
abydos
their
real
place
of
origin
must
have
been
hierakonpolis
where
the
kingdom
of
the
south
had
its
seat
the
hid
dynasty
was
no
doubt
of
memphite
origin
as
manetho
says
it
is
certain
that
the
seat
of
the
government
of
the
ivth
dynasty
was
at
memphis
where
the
kings
were
buried
and
we
know
that
the
sepulchres
of
two
hid
dynasty
kings
at
least
were
situated
in
the
necropolis
of
memphis
so
that
probably
the
seat
of
government
was
transferred
from
hierakonpolis
to
memphis
by
the
first
king
of
the
hid
dynasty
thenceforward
the
kings
were
buried
in
the
memphite
necropolis
the
two
great
nécropoles
of
memphis
and
abydos
were
originally
the
seats
of
the
worship
of
the
two
egyptian
gods
of
the
dead
seker
and
khentamenti
both
of
whom
were
afterwards
identified
with
the
busirite
god
osiris
abydos
was
also
the
centre
of
the
worship
of
anubis
an
of
the
dead
the
jackal
who
prowls
round
the
tombs
at
night
anubis
and
who
is
in
the
west
were
associated
in
the
minds
of
the
egyptians
as
the
protecting
deities
of
abydos
the
worship
of
these
gods
as
the
chief
southern
deities
of
the
dead
and
the
preeminence
of
the
necropolis
of
abydos
in
the
south
no
doubt
date
back
before
the
time
of
the
ist
dynasty
so
that
it
would
not
surprise
us
were
burials
of
kings
of
the
predynastic
hierakonpolite
kingdom
discovered
at
abydos
petrie
indeed
claims
to
have
discovered
actual
royal
relics
of
that
period
at
abydos
but
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
least
certain
of
his
conclusions
we
can
not
definitely
state
that
the
names
and
if
they
are
names
at
all
which
is
doubtful
belong
to
early
kings
of
hierakonpolis
who
were
buried
at
abydos
it
may
be
so
but
further
confirmation
is
desirable
before
we
accept
it
as
a
fact
and
as
yet
such
confirmation
has
not
been
forthcoming
the
oldest
kings
who
were
certainly
buried
at
abydos
seem
to
have
been
the
first
rulers
of
the
united
kingdom
of
the
north
and
south
aha
and
his
successors
is
not
represented
it
may
be
that
he
was
not
buried
at
abydos
but
in
the
necropolis
of
hierakonpolis
this
would
point
to
the
kings
of
the
south
not
having
been
buried
at
abydos
until
after
the
unification
of
the
kingdom
that
aha
possessed
a
tomb
at
abydos
as
well
as
another
at
nakâda
seems
peculiar
but
it
is
a
phenomenon
not
unknown
in
egypt
several
kings
whose
bodies
were
actually
buried
elsewhere
had
second
tombs
at
abydos
in
order
that
they
might
last
near
the
tomb
of
osiris
although
they
might
not
prefer
to
them
usertsen
or
senusret
iii
is
a
case
in
point
he
was
really
buried
in
a
pyramid
at
illahun
up
in
the
north
but
he
had
a
great
rock
tomb
cut
for
him
in
the
cliffs
at
abydos
which
he
never
occupied
and
probably
had
never
intended
to
occupy
we
find
exactly
the
same
thing
far
back
at
the
beginning
of
egyptian
history
when
aha
possessed
not
only
a
great
at
nakâda
but
also
a
in
the
great
necropolis
of
abydos
it
may
be
that
other
kings
of
the
earliest
period
also
had
second
sepulchres
elsewhere
it
is
noteworthy
that
in
none
of
the
early
tombs
at
abydos
were
found
any
bodies
which
might
be
considered
those
of
the
kings
themselves
amélineau
discovered
bodies
of
attendants
or
slaves
who
were
in
all
probability
purposely
strangled
and
buried
around
the
royal
chamber
in
order
that
they
should
attend
the
king
in
the
next
world
but
no
royalties
petrie
found
the
arm
of
a
female
mummy
who
may
have
been
of
royal
blood
though
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
she
was
and
the
quaint
plait
and
fringe
of
false
hair
which
were
also
found
need
not
have
belonged
to
a
royal
mummy
it
is
therefore
quite
possible
that
these
tombs
at
abydos
were
not
the
actual
last
of
the
earliest
kings
who
may
really
have
been
buried
at
hierakonpolis
or
elsewhere
as
aha
was
newberry
and
gtarstang
in
their
history
of
suppose
that
aha
was
actually
buried
at
abydos
and
that
the
great
tomb
with
objects
bearing
his
name
found
by
de
morgan
at
nakâda
is
really
not
his
but
belonged
to
a
royal
princess
named
whose
name
is
found
in
conjunction
with
his
at
abydos
and
nakâda
but
the
argument
is
equally
valid
turned
round
the
other
way
the
nakâda
tomb
might
just
as
well
be
and
the
abydos
one
who
is
supposed
by
newberry
and
garstang
to
have
been
daughter
and
wife
was
evidently
closely
connected
with
aha
and
she
may
have
been
buried
with
him
at
nakâda
and
commemorated
with
him
at
abydos
it
is
probable
that
the
xixth
dynasty
and
manetho
considered
the
abydos
tombs
to
have
been
the
real
graves
of
the
kings
but
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
that
they
were
wrong
a
princess
named
who
may
have
been
daughter
was
actually
buried
beside
his
tomb
at
abydos
this
view
of
the
royal
tombs
at
abydos
tallies
to
a
great
extent
with
that
of
naville
who
has
energetically
maintained
the
view
that
amélineau
and
petrie
have
not
discovered
the
real
tombs
of
the
early
kings
but
only
their
contemporary
commemorative
at
abydos
the
only
real
tomb
of
the
ist
dynasty
therefore
as
yet
discovered
is
that
of
aha
at
nakâda
found
by
de
morgan
the
fact
that
attendant
slaves
were
buried
around
the
abydos
tombs
is
no
bar
to
the
view
that
the
tombs
were
only
the
monuments
not
the
real
graves
of
the
kings
the
royal
ghosts
would
naturally
visit
their
commemorative
chambers
at
abydos
in
order
to
be
in
the
company
of
the
great
osiris
and
ghostly
servants
would
be
as
necessary
to
their
majesties
at
abydos
as
elsewhere
it
must
not
be
thought
that
this
revised
opinion
of
the
abydos
tombs
detracts
in
the
slightest
degree
from
the
importance
of
the
discovery
of
amélineau
and
its
subsequent
and
more
detailed
investigation
by
petrie
these
monuments
are
as
valuable
for
historical
purposes
as
the
real
tombs
themselves
the
actual
bodies
of
these
primeval
kings
themselves
we
are
never
likely
to
find
the
tomb
of
aha
at
nakâda
had
been
completely
rifled
in
ancient
times
the
commemorative
tombs
of
the
kings
of
the
ist
and
iid
dynasties
at
abydos
lie
southwest
of
the
great
necropolis
far
within
the
bay
in
the
hills
their
present
aspect
is
that
of
a
wilderness
of
sand
hillocks
covered
with
masses
of
fragments
of
red
pottery
from
which
the
site
has
obtained
the
modern
arab
name
of
of
it
is
impossible
to
move
a
step
in
any
direction
without
crushing
some
of
these
potsherds
under
the
heel
they
are
chiefly
the
remains
of
the
countless
little
vases
of
rough
red
pottery
which
were
dedicated
here
as
by
the
pious
between
the
xixth
and
xxvith
dynasties
to
the
memory
of
the
ancient
kings
and
of
the
great
god
osiris
whose
tomb
as
we
shall
see
was
supposed
to
have
been
situated
here
also
illustration
right
the
tomb
of
king
den
at
abydos
about
intermingled
with
these
later
fragments
are
pieces
of
the
original
ist
dynasty
vases
which
were
filled
with
wine
and
provisions
and
were
placed
in
the
tombs
for
the
refreshment
and
delectation
of
the
royal
ghosts
when
they
should
visit
their
houses
at
abydos
these
were
thrown
out
and
broken
when
the
tombs
were
violated
here
and
there
one
sees
a
dip
in
the
sand
out
of
which
rise
four
walls
of

chamber
with

this
is
one
of
the
royal
of
the
ist
dynasty
that
of
king
den
is
illustrated
above
a
straight
staircase
descends
into
it
from
the
above
in
several
of
the
tombs
the
original
flooring
of
wooden
beams
is
still
preserved
is
the
most
magnificent
of
all
for
it
has
a
floor
of
granite
blocks
we
know
of
no
other
instance
of
stone
being
used
for
building
in
this
early
age
almost
every
tomb
has
been
burnt
at
some
period
unknown
the
brick
walls
are
burnt
red
and
many
of
the
alabaster
vases
are
almost
calcined
this
was
probably
the
work
of
some
unknown
enemy
the
wide
complicated
tombs
have
around
the
main
chamber
a
series
of
smaller
rooms
which
were
used
to
store
what
was
considered
necessary
for
the
use
of
the
royal
ghost
of
these
necessaries
the
most
interesting
to
us
are
the
slaves
who
were
as
there
is
little
reason
to
doubt
purposely
killed
and
buried
round
the
royal
chamber
so
that
their
spirits
should
be
on
the
spot
when
the
dead
king
came
to
abydos
thus
they
would
be
always
ready
to
serve
him
with
the
food
and
other
things
which
had
been
stored
in
the
tomb
with
them
and
placed
under
their
charge
there
were
stacks
of
great
vases
of
wine
corn
and
other
food
these
were
covered
up
with
masses
of
fat
to
preserve
the
contents
and
they
were
corked
with
a
pottery
stopper
which
was
protected
by
a
conical
clay
sealing
stamped
with
the
impress
of
the
royal
there
were
bins
of
corn
joints
of
oxen
pottery
dishes
copper
pans
and
other
things
which
might
be
useful
for
the
ghostly
cuisine
of
the
tomb
there
were
numberless
small
objects
used
no
doubt
by
the
dead
monarch
during
life
which
he
would
be
pleased
to
see
again
in
the
next
world
carved
ivory
boxes
little
slabs
for
grinding
golden
buttons
model
tools
model

with
gold
tops
ivory
and
pottery
figurines
and
other
the
golden
royal
seal
of
judgment
of
king
den
in
its
ivory
casket
and
so
forth
there
were
memorials
of
the
royal
victories
in
peace
and
war
little
ivory
plaques
with
inscriptions
commemorating
the
founding
of
new
buildings
the
institution
of
new
religious
festivals
in
honour
of
the
gods
the
bringing
of
the
captives
of
the
royal
bow
and
spear
to
the
palace
the
discomfiture
of
the
peoples
of
the
illustration
conical
from
abydos
dynasty
about
all
these
things
which
have
done
so
much
to
reconstitute
for
us
the
history
of
the
earliest
period
of
the
egyptian
monarchy
were
placed
under
the
care
of
the
dead
slaves
whose
bodies
were
buried
round
the
empty
of
their
royal
master
in
abydos
the
killing
and
entombment
of
the
royal
servants
is
of
the
highest
anthropological
interest
for
it
throws
a
vivid
light
upon
the
manners
of
the
time
it
shows
the
primeval
egyptians
as
a
people
of
childishly
simple
ways
of
thought
the
king
was
dead
for
all
his
kingship
he
was
a
man
and
no
man
was
immortal
in
this
world
but
yet
how
could
one
really
die
shadows
dreams
all
kinds
of
phenomena
which
the
primitive
mind
could
not
explain
induced
the
belief
that
though
the
outer
man
might
rot
there
was
an
inner
man
which
could
not
die
and
still
lived
on
the
idea
of
total
death
was
unthinkable
and
where
should
this
inner
man
still
live
on
but
in
the
tomb
to
which
the
outer
man
was
consigned
and
here
doubtless
it
was
believed
in
the
house
to
which
the
body
was
consigned
the
ghost
lived
on
and
as
each
ghost
had
his
house
with
the
body
so
no
doubt
all
ghosts
could
communicate
with
one
another
from
tomb
to
tomb
and
so
there
grew
up
the
belief
in
a
a
subterranean
egypt
of
tombs
in
which
the
dead
egyptians
still
lived
and
had
their
being
later
on
the
boat
of
the
sun
in
which
the
god
of
light
crossed
the
heavens
by
day
was
thought
to
pass
through
this
dead
world
between
his
setting
and
his
rising
accompanied
by
the
souls
of
the
righteous
but
of
this
belief
we
find
no
trace
yet
in
the
ideas
of
the
ist
dynasty
all
we
can
see
is
that
the
or
bodies
of
the
dead
were
supposed
to
reside
in
awful
majesty
in
the
tomb
while
the
ghosts
could
pass
from
tomb
to
tomb
through
the
mazes
of
the
underworld
over
this
dread
realm
of
dead
men
presided
a
dead
god
osiris
of
abydos
and
so
the
necropolis
of
abydos
was
the
necropolis
of
the
underworld
to
which
all
ghosts
who
were
not
its
rightful
citizens
would
come
from
afar
to
pay
their
court
to
their
ruler
thus
the
man
of
substance
would
have
a
monumental
tablet
put
up
to
himself
in
this
necropolis
as
a
sort
of
even
if
he
could
not
be
buried
there
for
the
king
who
for
reasons
chiefly
connected
with
local
patriotism
was
buried
near
the
city
of
his
earthly
abode
a
second
tomb
would
be
erected
a
stately
mansion
in
the
city
of
osiris
in
which
his
ghost
could
reside
when
it
pleased
him
to
come
to
abydos
now
none
could
live
without
food
and
men
living
under
the
earth
needed
it
as
much
as
men
living
on
the
earth
the
royal
tomb
was
thus
provided
with
an
enormous
amount
of
earthly
food
for
the
use
of
the
royal
ghost
and
with
other
things
as
well
as
we
have
seen
the
same
provision
had
also
to
be
made
for
the
royal
at
abydos
and
in
both
cases
royal
slaves
were
needed
to
take
care
of
all
this
provision
and
to
serve
the
ghost
of
the
king
whether
in
his
real
tomb
at
nakâda
or
elsewhere
or
in
his
second
tomb
at
abydos
ghosts
only
could
serve
ghosts
so
that
of
the
slaves
ghosts
had
to
be
made
that
was
easily
done
they
died
when
their
master
died
and
followed
him
to
the
tomb
no
doubt
it
seemed
perfectly
natural
to
all
concerned
to
the
slaves
as
much
as
to
anybody
else
but
it
shows
the
idea
of
the
value
of
life
an
animate
thing
was
hardly
distinguished
at
this
period
from
an
inanimate
thing
the
most
ancient
egyptians
buried
slaves
with
their
kings
as
naturally
as
they
buried
jars
of
wine
and
bins
of
corn
with
them
both
were
buried
with
a
definite
object
the
slaves
had
to
die
before
they
were
buried
but
then
so
had
the
king
himself
they
all
had
to
die
sometime
or
other
and
the
actual
killing
of
them
was
no
worse
than
killing
a
dog
no
worse
even
than
golden
buttons
and
ivory
boxes
for
when
the
buttons
and
boxes
were
buried
with
the
king
they
were
just
as
much
dead
as
the
slaves
of
the
sanctity
of
life
as
distinct
from
other
life
there
was
probably
no
idea
at
all
the
royal
ghost
needed
ghostly
servants
and
they
were
provided
as
a
matter
of
course
but
as
civilization
progressed
the
ideas
of
the
egyptians
changed
on
these
points
and
in
the
later
ages
of
the
ancient
world
they
were
probably
the
most
humane
of
the
peoples
far
more
so
than
the
greeks
in
fact
the
cultured
hellenes
murdered
their
prisoners
of
war
without
hesitation
who
has
not
been
troubled
in
mind
by
the
execution
of
mkias
and
demosthenes
after
the
surrender
of
the
athenian
army
at
syracuse
when
we
compare
this
with
refusal
even
to
take
sword
at
appomattox
we
see
how
we
have
progressed
in
these
matters
while
gylippus
and
the
syracusans
were
as
much
children
as
the
ist
dynasty
egyptians
but
the
egyptians
of
time
had
probably
advanced
much
further
than
the
greeks
in
the
direction
of
rational
manhood
when
amasis
had
his
rival
apries
in
his
power
he
did
not
put
him
to
death
but
kept
him
as
his
coadjutor
on
the
throne
apries
fled
from
him
allied
himself
with
greek
pirates
and
advanced
against
his
generous
rival
after
his
defeat
and
murder
at
momemphis
amasis
gave
him
a
splendid
burial
when
we
compare
this
generosity
to
a
beaten
foe
with
the
savagery
of
the
assyrians
for
instance
we
see
how
far
the
later
egyptians
had
progressed
in
the
paths
of
humanity
the
ancient
custom
of
killing
slaves
was
first
discontinued
at
the
death
of
the
lesser
chieftains
but
we
find
a
possible
survival
of
it
in
the
case
of
a
king
even
as
late
as
the
time
of
the
xith
dynasty
for
at
thebes
in
the
precinct
of
the
funerary
temple
of
king
mentuhetep
and
round
the
central
pyramid
which
commemorated
his
memory
were
buried
a
number
of
the
ladies
of
his
they
were
all
buried
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
they
were
all
killed
and
buried
round
the
king
in
order
to
be
with
him
in
the
next
world
now
with
each
of
these
ladies
who
had
been
turned
into
ghosts
was
buried
a
little
waxen
human
figure
placed
in
a
little
model
coffin
this
was
to
replace
her
own
slave
she
who
went
to
accompany
the
king
in
the
next
world
had
to
have
her
own
attendant
also
but
not
being
royal
a
real
slave
was
not
killed
for
her
she
only
took
with
her
a
waxen
figure
which
by
means
of
charms
and
incantations
would
when
she
called
upon
it
turn
into
a
real
slave
and
say
am
i
and
do
whatever
work
might
be
required
of
her
the
actual
killing
and
burial
of
the
slaves
had
in
all
cases
except
that
of
the
king
been
long
so
to
speak
into
a
burial
with
the
dead
person
of
or
little
figures
like
those
described
above
made
more
usually
of
stone
and
inscribed
with
the
name
of
the
deceased
they
were
called
because
they
answered
the
call
of
their
dead
master
or
mistress
and
by
magic
power
became
ghostly
servants
later
on
they
were
made
of
wood
and
glazed
as
well
as
stone
by
this
means
the
greater
humanity
of
a
later
age
sought
a
relief
from
the
primitive
disregard
of
the
death
of
others
anthropologically
interesting
as
are
the
results
of
the
excavations
at
umm
they
are
no
less
historically
important
there
is
no
need
here
to
weary
the
reader
with
the
details
of
scientific
controversy
it
will
suffice
to
set
before
him
as
succinctly
and
clearly
as
possible
the
net
results
of
the
work
which
has
been
done
amélineau
and
petrie
have
found
the
secondary
tombs
and
have
identified
the
names
of
the
following
primeval
kings
of
egypt
we
arrange
them
in
their
apparent
historical
order
aha
men
narmer
or
betjumer
sma

or
khent

two
or
three
other
names
are
ascribed
by
petrie
to
the
hierakonpolite
dynasty
of
upper
egypt
which
as
it
occurs
before
the
time
of
mena
and
the
ist
dynasty
he
calls
dynasty
however
is
no
dynasty
and
in
any
case
we
should
prefer
to
call
the
dynasty
the
names
of
minus
one
however
remain
problematical
and
for
the
present
it
would
seem
safer
to
suspend
judgment
as
to
the
place
of
the
supposed
royal
names
and
which
petrie
supposes
to
have
been
those
of
two
of
the
kings
of
upper
egypt
who
reigned
before
mena
the
king
is
possibly
identical
with
aha
or
narmer
more
probably
the
latter
it
is
not
necessary
to
detail
the
process
by
which
egyptologists
have
sought
to
identify
these
thirteen
kings
with
the
successors
of
mena
in
the
lists
of
kings
and
the
ist
and
iid
dynasties
of
manetho
the
work
has
been
very
successful
though
not
perhaps
quite
so
completely
accomplished
as
petrie
himself
inclines
to
believe
the
first
identification
was
made
by
sethe
of
gottingen
who
pointed
out
that
the
names
semti
and
merpeba
on
a
found
by
amélineau
were
in
reality
those
of
the
kings
hesepti
and
merbap
of
the
lists
the
ousaphaïs
and
miebis
of
manetho
the
perfectly
certain
identifications
are
these
den
semti
hesepti
ist

atjab
merpeba
merbap
ist

semerkha
shemsu
or
semsem
ist
dynasty
qâ
sen
qebh
ist
dynasty
khâsekhemui
besh
iid
dynasty
neneter
bineneter
iid
dynasty
six
of
the
abydos
kings
have
thus
been
identified
with
names
in
the
lists
and
in
manetho
that
is
to
say
we
now
know
the
real
names
of
six
of
the
earliest
egyptian
monarchs
whose
appellations
are
given
us
under
mutilated
forms
by
the
later
petrie
further
identifies
tja
ati
with
ateth
tjer
with
teta
and
aha
with
mena
mena
teta
ateth
ata
hesepti
merbap
shemsu
and
qebh
are
the
names
of
the
dynasty
as
given
in
the
lists
the
equivalent
of
ata
petrie
finds
in
the
name
which
is
found
at
umm
but
there
is
no
proof
whatever
that
merneit
was
a
king
he
was
much
more
probably
a
prince
or
other
great
personage
of
the
reign
of
den
who
was
buried
with
the
kings
petrie
accepts
the
identification
of
the
personal
name
of
aha
as
and
so
makes
him
the
only
equivalent
of
mena
but
this
reading
of
the
name
is
still
doubtful
arguing
that
aha
must
be
mena
and
having
all
the
rest
of
the
kings
of
the
ist
dynasty
identified
with
the
names
in
the
lists
petrie
is
compelled
to
exclude
narmer
from
the
dynasty
and
to
relegate
him
to
before
the
time
of
mena
it
is
quite
possible
however
that
narmer
was
the
successor
not
the
predecessor
of
mena
he
was
certainly
either
the
one
or
the
other
as
the
style
of
art
in
his
time
was
exactly
the
same
as
that
in
the
time
of
aha
the
too
whose
name
is
found
at
hierakonpolis
certainly
dates
to
the
same
time
as
narmer
and
aha
for
the
style
of
his
work
is
the
same
and
it
may
well
be
that
he
is
not
to
be
counted
as
a
separate
king
belonging
to
or
at
all
but
as
identical
with
narmer
just
as
may
also
be
we
thus
find
that
the
two
kings
who
left
the
most
developed
remains
at
hierakonpolis
are
the
two
whose
monuments
at
abydos
are
the
oldest
of
all
on
that
site
that
is
to
say
the
kings
whose
monuments
record
the
conquest
of
the
north
belong
to
the
period
of
transition
from
the
old
hierakonpolite
dominion
of
upper
egypt
to
the
new
kingdom
of
all
egypt
they
in
fact
represent
the
or
menés
of
tradition
it
may
be
that
aha
bore
the
personal
name
of
which
would
thus
be
the
original
of
mena
but
this
is
uncertain
in
any
case
both
aha
and
narmer
must
be
assigned
to
the
ist
dynasty
with
the
result
that
we
know
of
more
kings
belonging
to
the
dynasty
than
appear
in
the
lists
nor
is
this
improbable
list
is
evidently
based
upon
old
egyptian
lists
derived
from
the
authorities
upon
which
the
of
abydos
and
sakkâra
were
based
these
old
lists
were
made
under
the
xixth
dynasty
when
an
interest
in
the
oldest
kings
seems
to
have
been
awakened
and
the
ruling
monarchs
erected
temples
at
abydos
in
their
honour
this
phenomenon
can
only
have
been
due
to
a
discovery
of
umm
and
its
treasures
the
tombs
of
which
were
recognized
as
the
real
or
secondary
of
the
kings
before
the
seti
and
his
son
ramses
then
worshipped
the
kings
of
umm
with
their
names
set
before
them
in
the
order
number
and
spelling
in
which
the
scribes
considered
they
ought
to
be
inscribed
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
number
known
at
that
time
was
not
quite
correct
we
know
that
the
spelling
of
the
names
was
very
much
garbled
to
take
one
example
only
the
signs
for
were
read
as
one
sign
so
that
one
or
two
kings
may
have
been
omitted
or
displaced
this
may
be
the
case
with
narmer
or
as
his
name
ought
possibly
to
be
read
his
monuments
show
by
their
style
that
he
belongs
to
the
very
beginning
of
the
ist
dynasty
no
name
in
the
ist
dynasty
list
corresponds
to
his
but
one
of
the
lists
gives
for
the
first
king
of
the
iid
dynasty
the
successor
of
sen
a
name
which
may
also
be
read
betjumer
spelt
syllabically
this
time
not
ideographically
on
this
account
naville
wishes
to
regard
the
hierakonpolite
monuments
of
narmer
as
belonging
to
the
iid
dynasty
but
as
we
have
seen
they
are
among
the
most
archaic
known
and
certainly
must
belong
to
the
beginning
of
the
ist
dynasty
it
is
therefore
probable
that
khasekhemui
besh
and
narmer
betjumer
were
confused
by
this
and
the
name
betjumer
was
given
to
the
first
king
of
the
iid
dynasty
who
was
probably
in
reality
khasekhemui
the
resemblance
of
to
may
have
contributed
to
this
confusion
so
narmer
or
betjumer
found
his
way
out
of
his
proper
place
at
the
beginning
of
the
dynasty
whether
aha
was
also
called
or
not
it
seems
evident
that
he
and
narmer
were
jointly
the
originals
of
the
legendary
mena
narmer
who
possibly
also
bore
the
name
of
sma
uniter
conquered
the
north
aha
fighter
also
ruled
both
south
and
north
at
the
same
period
khasekhemui
too
conquered
the
north
but
the
style
of
his
monuments
shows
such
an
advance
upon
that
of
the
days
of
aha
and
narmer
that
it
seems
best
to
make
him
the
successor
of
sen
or
and
explaining
the
transference
of
the
name
betjumer
to
the
beginning
of
the
iid
dynasty
as
due
to
a
confusion
with
personal
name
besh
to
make
khasekhemui
the
founder
of
the
iid
dynasty
the
beginning
of
a
new
dynasty
may
well
have
been
marked
by
a
reassertion
of
the
new
royal
power
over
lower
egypt
which
may
have
lapsed
somewhat
under
the
rule
of
the
later
kings
of
the
ist
dynasty
semti
is
certainly
the
of
the
lists
and
tja
ati
is
probably
is
thus
unidentified
petrie
makes
him
merneit
but
as
has
already
been
said
there
is
no
proof
that
the
tomb
of
merneit
is
that
of
a
king
may
be
tjer
or
khent
but
of
this
there
is
no
proof
it
is
most
probable
that
the
names
and
are
all
founded
on
ati
the
personal
name
of
tja
the
king
tjer
is
then
not
represented
in
the
lists
and
is
a
compound
of
the
two
oldest
abydos
kings
narmer
betjumer
sma
and
aha
men
these
are
the
bare
historical
results
that
have
been
attained
with
regard
to
the
names
identity
and
order
of
the
kings
the
smaller
memorials
that
have
been
found
with
them
especially
the
ivory
plaques
have
told
us
of
events
that
took
place
during
their
reigns
but
with
the
exception
of
the
constantly
recurring
references
to
the
conquest
of
the
north
there
is
little
that
can
be
considered
of
historical
interest
or
importance
we
will
take
one
as
an
example
this
is
the
tablet
no
of
the
british
museum
illustrated
by
petrie
i
egypt
exploration
fund
pi
xi
xv
this
is
the
record
of
a
single
year
the
first
in
the
reign
of
semti
king
of
upper
and
lower
egypt
on
it
we
see
a
picture
of
a
king
performing
a
religious
dance
before
the
god
osiris
who
is
seated
in
a
shrine
placed
on
a
dais
this
religious
dance
was
performed
by
all
the
kings
in
later
times
below
we
find
hieroglyphic
ideographic
records
of
a
river
expedition
to
fight
the
northerners
and
of
the
capture
of
a
fortified
town
called
an
the
capture
of
the
town
is
indicated
by
a
broken
line
of
fortification
the
name
and
the
hoe
with
which
the
emblematic
hawks
on
the
slate
reliefs
already
described
are
armed
this
signifies
the
opening
and
breaking
down
of
the
wall
on
the
other
half
of
the
tablet
we
find
the
viceroy
of
lower
egypt
hemaka
mentioned
also
hawk
the
king
seizes
the
seat
of
the
libyans
and
some
unintelligible
record
of
a
jeweller
of
the
palace
and
a
carpenter
on
a
similar
tablet
of
sen
we
find
the
words
carpenter
made
this
all
these
little
tablets
are
then
the
records
of
single
years
of
a
life
and
others
like
them
preserved
no
doubt
in
royal
archives
formed
the
base
of
regular
annals
which
were
occasionally
carved
upon
stone
we
have
an
example
of
one
of
these
in
the
of
palermo
a
fragment
of
black
granite
inscribed
with
the
annals
of
the
kings
up
to
the
time
of
the
vth
dynasty
when
the
monument
itself
was
made
it
is
a
matter
for
intense
regret
that
the
greater
portion
of
this
priceless
historical
monument
has
disappeared
leaving
us
but
a
piece
out
of
the
centre
with
part
of
the
records
of
only
six
kings
before
snefru
of
these
six
the
name
of
only
one
neneter
of
the
lid
dynasty
whose
name
is
also
found
at
abydos
is
mentioned
the
only
important
historical
event
of
reign
seems
to
have
occurred
in
his
thirteenth
year
when
the
towns
or
palaces
of
and
sun
were
founded
nothing
but
the
institution
and
celebration
of
religious
festivals
is
recorded
in
the
sixteen
yearly
entries
preserved
to
us
out
of
a
reign
of
years
the
annual
height
of
the
nile
is
given
and
the
occasions
of
numbering
the
people
are
recorded
every
second
year
nothing
else
manetho
tells
us
that
in
the
reign
of
binothris
who
is
neneter
it
was
decreed
that
women
could
hold
royal
honours
and
privileges
this
first
concession
of
rights
is
not
mentioned
on
the
strictly
official
more
regrettable
than
aught
else
is
the
absence
from
the
of
that
part
of
the
original
monument
which
gave
the
annals
of
the
earliest
kings
at
any
rate
in
the
lines
of
annals
which
still
exist
above
that
which
contains
the
chronicle
of
the
reign
of
neneter
no
entry
can
be
definitely
identified
as
belonging
to
the
reigns
of
aha
or
narmer
in
a
line
below
there
is
a
mention
of
the
of
khâsekhemui
apparently
a
festival
in
honour
of
the
birth
of
that
king
celebrated
in
the
same
way
as
the
reputed
birthday
of
a
god
this
shows
the
great
honour
in
which
khâsekhemui
was
held
and
perhaps
it
was
he
who
really
finally
settled
the
question
of
the
unification
of
north
and
south
and
consolidated
the
work
of
the
earlier
kings
as
far
as
we
can
tell
then
aha
and
narmer
were
the
first
conquerors
of
the
north
the
unifiers
of
the
kingdom
and
the
originals
of
the
legendary
mena
in
their
time
the
centre
of
gravity
was
still
in
the
south
and
narmer
who
is
probably
identical
with
dedicated
the
memorials
of
his
deeds
in
the
temple
of
hierakonpolis
it
may
be
that
the
legend
of
the
founding
of
memphis
in
the
time
of
is
nearly
correct
as
we
shall
see
historically
the
foundation
may
have
been
due
to
merpeba
but
we
have
the
authority
of
manetho
for
the
fact
that
the
first
two
dynasties
were
that
is
upper
egyptian
and
that
memphis
did
not
become
the
capital
till
the
time
of
the
hid
dynasty
with
this
statement
the
evidence
of
the
monuments
fully
agrees
the
earliest
royal
tombs
in
the
of
memphis
date
from
the
time
of
the
hid
dynasty
so
that
it
is
evident
that
the
kings
had
then
taken
up
their
abode
in
the
northern
capital
we
find
that
soon
after
the
time
of
khâsekhemui
the
king
perabsen
was
especially
connected
with
lower
egypt
his
personal
name
is
unknown
to
us
though
he
may
be
the
of
the
lists
but
we
do
know
that
he
had
two
and
perabsen
the
first
is
his
hawk
or
the
second
his
that
is
to
say
while
he
bore
the
first
name
as
king
of
upper
egypt
under
the
special
patronage
of
horus
the
of
the
upper
country
he
bore
the
second
as
king
of
lower
egypt
under
the
patronage
of
set
the
deity
of
the
delta
whose
fetish
animal
appears
above
this
name
instead
of
the
hawk
this
shows
how
definitely
perabsen
wished
to
appear
as
legitimate
king
of
lower
as
well
as
upper
egypt
in
later
times
the
theban
kings
of
the
xiith
dynasty
when
they
devoted
themselves
to
winning
the
allegiance
of
the
northerners
by
living
near
memphis
rather
than
at
thebes
seem
to
have
been
imitating
the
successors
of
khâsekhemui
moreover
we
now
find
various
evidences
of
increasing
connection
with
the
north
a
princess
named
who
seems
to
have
been
the
mother
of
the
first
king
of
the
hid
dynasty
bears
the
name
of
the
sacred
apis
of
memphis
her
name
signifying
the
right
of
according
to
manetho
the
kings
of
the
hid
dynasty
are
the
first
memphites
and
this
seems
to
be
quite
correct
with
the
royal
right
seems
to
have
been
transferred
to
a
memphite
house
but
the
memphites
still
had
associations
with
upper
egypt
two
of
them
tjeser
and
were
buried
near
abydos
in
the
desert
at
bêt
khallâf
where
their
tombs
were
discovered
and
excavated
by
garstang
in
the
tomb
of
tjeser
is
a
great
mastaba
forty
feet
high
and
measuring
feet
by
feet
the
actual
are
excavated
in
the
rock
twenty
feet
below
the
and
sixty
feet
below
the
top
of
the
mastaba
they
had
been
violated
in
ancient
times
but
a
number
of
clay
alabaster
vases
and
bowls
belonging
to
the
tomb
furniture
were
found
by
the
discoverer
tomb
is
similar
in
it
was
found
the
preserved
skeleton
of
its
owner
who
was
a
giant
seven
feet
high
illustration
the
tomb
of
king
tjeser
at
bêt
khallâf
about
it
is
remarkable
that
manetho
chronicles
among
the
kings
of
the
early
period
a
king
named
sesokhris
who
was
five
cubits
high
this
may
have
been
tjeser
had
two
tombs
one
the
near
abydos
the
other
at
sakkâra
in
the
memphite
this
is
the
famous
since
seems
really
to
have
been
buried
at
bêt
probably
tjeser
was
too
and
the
may
have
been
his
secondary
or
sham
tomb
erected
in
the
necropolis
of
memphis
as
a
compliment
to
seker
the
northern
god
of
the
dead
just
as
aha
had
his
secondary
tomb
at
abydos
in
compliment
to
khentamenti
also
the
last
king
of
the
hid
dynasty
seems
to
have
had
two
tombs
one
of
these
was
the
great
pyramid
of
mêdûm
which
was
explored
by
petrie
in
the
other
was
at
dashûr
near
by
was
the
interesting
necropolis
already
mentioned
in
which
was
discovered
evidence
of
the
continuance
of
the
cramped
position
of
burial
and
of
the
absence
of
mummification
among
a
certain
section
of
the
population
even
as
late
as
the
time
of
the
ivth
dynasty
this
has
been
taken
to
imply
that
the
fusion
of
the
primitive
neolithic
and
invading
races
had
not
been
effected
at
that
time
with
the
ivth
dynasty
the
connection
of
the
royal
house
with
the
south
seems
to
have
finally
ceased
the
governmental
centre
of
gravity
was
finally
transferred
to
memphis
and
the
kings
were
thenceforth
for
several
centuries
buried
in
the
great
pyramids
which
still
stand
in
serried
order
along
the
western
desert
border
of
egypt
from
the
delta
to
the
province
of
the
fayyum
with
the
latest
discoveries
in
this
memphite
we
shall
deal
in
the
next
chapter
the
transference
of
the
royal
power
to
memphis
under
the
hid
dynasty
naturally
led
to
a
great
increase
of
egyptian
activity
in
the
northern
lands
we
read
in
manetho
of
a
great
libyan
war
in
the
reign
of
and
both
and
tjeser
seem
to
have
finally
established
egyptian
authority
in
the
sinaitic
peninsula
where
their
have
been
found
in
petrie
was
despatched
to
sinai
by
the
egypt
exploration
fund
in
order
finally
to
record
the
inscriptions
of
the
early
kings
in
the
wadi
maghara
which
had
been
lately
very
much
damaged
by
the
operations
of
the
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
ignorance
and
vandalism
should
still
be
so
rampant
in
the
twentieth
century
that
the
most
important
historical
monuments
are
not
safe
from
desecration
in
order
to
obtain
a
few
turquoises
but
it
is
so
expedition
did
not
start
a
day
too
soon
and
at
the
suggestion
of
sir
william
garstin
the
adviser
to
the
ministry
of
the
interior
the
majority
of
the
inscriptions
have
been
removed
to
the
cairo
museum
for
safety
and
preservation
among
the
new
inscriptions
discovered
is
one
of
which
is
now
in
the
british
museum
tjeser
and
were
not
the
first
egyptian
kings
to
visit
sinai
already
in
the
days
of
the
dynasty
semerkha
had
entered
that
land
and
inscribed
his
name
upon
the
rocks
but
the
regular
annexation
so
to
speak
of
sinai
to
egypt
took
place
under
the
memphites
of
the
hid
dynasty
with
the
hid
dynasty
we
have
reached
the
age
of
the
the
most
typical
pyramids
are
those
of
the
three
great
kings
of
the
ivth
dynasty
khufu
khafra
and
menkaura
at
giza
near
cairo
but
as
we
have
seen
the
last
king
of
the
hid
dynasty
snefru
also
had
one
pyramid
if
not
two
and
the
most
ancient
of
these
buildings
known
to
us
the
of
sakkâra
was
erected
by
tjeser
at
the
beginning
of
that
dynasty
the
evolution
of
the
royal
tombs
from
the
time
of
the
dynasty
to
that
of
the
ivth
is
very
interesting
to
trace
at
the
period
of
transition
from
the
predynastic
to
the
dynastic
age
we
have
the
great
mastaba
of
aha
at
nakâda
and
the
simplest
at
abydos
all
these
were
of
brick
no
stone
was
used
in
their
construction
then
we
find
the
of
den
semti
at
abydos
with
a
granite
floor
the
walls
being
still
of
brick
above
each
of
the
abydos
tombs
was
probably
a
low
mound
and
in
front
a
small
chapel
from
which
a
flight
of
steps
descended
into
the
simple
chamber
on
one
of
the
little
plaques
already
mentioned
which
were
found
in
these
tombs
we
have
an
archaic
inscription
entirely
written
in
ideographs
which
seems
to
read
the
chiefs
come
to
the
the
ideograph
for
seems
to
be
a
rude
picture
of
the
funerary
chapel
but
from
it
we
can
derive
little
information
as
to
its
construction
towards
the
end
of
the
ist
dynasty
and
during
the
lid
the
royal
tombs
became
much
more
complicated
being
surrounded
with
numerous
chambers
for
the
dead
slaves
etc
tomb
has
such
chambers
and
there
is
one
large
chamber
of
stone
we
know
of
no
other
instance
of
the
use
of
stone
work
for
building
at
this
period
except
in
the
royal
tombs
no
doubt
the
art
was
still
so
difficult
that
it
was
reserved
for
royal
use
only
under
the
hid
dynasty
we
find
the
last
brick
mastabas
built
for
royalty
at
bêt
khallâf
and
the
first
pyramids
in
the
memphite
necropolis
in
the
mastaba
of
tjeser
at
bêt
khallâf
stone
was
used
for
the
great
portcullises
which
were
intended
to
bar
the
way
to
possible
plunderers
through
the
passages
of
the
tomb
the
at
sakkâra
is
so
to
speak
a
series
of
mastabas
of
stone
imposed
one
above
the
other
it
never
had
the
continuous
casing
of
stone
which
is
the
mark
of
a
true
pyramid
the
pyramid
of
snefru
at
mêdûm
is
more
developed
it
also
originated
in
a
mastaba
enlarged
and
with
another
erection
on
the
top
of
it
but
it
was
given
a
continuous
sloping
casing
of
fine
limestone
from
bottom
to
top
and
so
is
a
true
pyramid
a
discussion
of
recent
theories
as
to
the
building
of
the
later
pyramids
of
the
ivth
dynasty
will
be
found
in
the
next
chapter
in
the
time
of
the
ist
dynasty
the
royal
tomb
was
known
by
the
name
of
the
but
under
the
hid
and
ivth
dynasties
regular
names
such
as
firm

found
a
large
bed
or
bier
of
granite
with
a
figure
of
the
god
osiris
lying
in
state
sculptured
in
high
relief
upon
it
this
led
him
to
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
found
the
tomb
of
the
god
osiris
himself
and
that
a
skull
he
found
close
by
was
the
veritable
cranium
of
the
primeval
who
according
to
the
euhemerist
theory
was
the
deified
original
of
the
god
the
true
explanation
is
given
by
wallis
budge
in
his
of
i
it
is
a
fact
that
the
tomb
of
tjer
was
regarded
by
the
egyptians
of
the
xixth
dynasty
as
the
veritable
tomb
of
osiris
they
thought
they
had
discovered
it
just
as
amélineau
did
when
the
ancient
royal
tombs
of
umm
were
rediscovered
and
identified
at
the
beginning
of
the
xixth
dynasty
and
seti
i
built
the
great
temple
of
abydos
to
the
divine
ancestors
in
honour
of
the
discovery
embellishing
it
with
a
relief
of
himself
and
his
son
ramses
making
offerings
to
the
names
of
his
predecessors
the
of
abydos
the
name
of
king
khent
or
tjer
which
is
perhaps
the
really
correct
original
form
was
read
by
the
royal
scribes
as
and
hastily
identified
with
the
first
part
of
the
name
of
the
god
osiris
the
lord
of
abydos
the
tomb
was
thus
regarded
as
the
tomb
of
osiris
himself
and
it
was
furnished
with
a
great
stone
figure
of
the
god
lying
on
his
bier
attended
by
the
two
hawks
of
isis
and
nephthys
ever
after
the
site
was
visited
by
crowds
of
pilgrims
who
left
at
umm
the
thousands
of
little
votive
vases
whose
fragments
have
given
the
place
its
name
of
the
of
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
discovery
of
the
of
we
have
not
found
what
amélineau
seems
rather
naively
to
have
thought
possible
a
confirmation
of
the
ancient
view
that
osiris
was
originally
a
man
who
ruled
over
egypt
and
was
deified
after
his
death
but
we
have
found
that
the
egyptians
themselves
were
more
or
less
euhemerists
and
did
think
so
it
may
seem
remarkable
that
all
this
new
knowledge
of
ancient
egypt
is
derived
from
tombs
and
has
to
do
with
the
of
the
kings
when
dead
rather
than
with
their
palaces
or
temples
when
living
of
temples
at
this
early
period
we
have
no
trace
the
oldest
temple
in
egypt
is
perhaps
the
little
chapel
in
front
of
the
pyramid
of
snefru
at
mêdûm
we
first
hear
of
temples
to
the
gods
under
the
ivth
dynasty
but
of
the
actual
buildings
of
that
period
we
have
recovered
nothing
but
one
or
two
inscribed
blocks
of
stone
petrie
has
traced
out
the
plan
of
the
oldest
temple
of
osiris
at
abydos
which
may
be
of
the
time
of
khufu
from
scanty
evidences
which
give
us
but
little
information
it
is
certain
however
that
this
temple
which
is
clearly
one
of
the
oldest
in
egypt
goes
back
at
least
to
his
time
its
site
is
the
mound
called
kom
mound
of
the
king
close
to
the
village
of
and
on
the
borders
of
the
cultivation
northeast
of
the
royal
tombs
at
umm
of
royal
palaces
we
have
more
definite
information
north
of
the
kom
are
two
great
of

the
one
is
known
as
storehouse
of
dried
orapes
the
other
is
occupied
by
the
coptic
monastery
of
dêr
anba
musâs
both
are
certainly
of
the
earliest
period
of
the
egyptian
monarchy
we
know
from
the
small
of
this
period
that
the
kings
were
constantly
founding
or
repairing
places
of
this
kind
which
were
always
great
rectangular
enclosures
with
crenelated
brick
walls
like
those
of
early
babylonian
buildings
we
have
seen
that
the
northern
egyptian
possessed
similar
which
were
captured
by
narmer
these
were
the
seats
of
the
royal
residence
in
various
parts
of
the
country
behind
their
walls
was
the
house
and
no
doubt
also
a
town
of
nobles
and
retainers
while
the
peasants
lived

from
this

the

memphis
and
the
pyramids
memphis
the
abode
the
of
the
white
wall
is
said
to
have
been
founded
by
the
legendary
menés
who
in
order
to
build
it
diverted
the
stream
of
the
nile
by
means
of
a
great
dyke
constructed
near
the
modern
village
of
koshêsh
south
of
the
village
of
mitrahêna
which
marks
the
central
point
of
the
ancient
metropolis
of
northern
egypt
it
may
be
that
the
city
was
founded
by
aha
or
narmer
the
historical
originals
of
mena
or
menés
but
we
have
another
theory
with
regard
to
its
foundation
that
it
was
originally
built
by
king
merpeba
atjab
whose
tomb
was
also
discovered
at
abydos
near
those
of
aha
and
narmer
merpeba
is
the
oldest
king
whose
name
is
absolutely
identified
with
one
occurring
in
the
xixth
dynasty
and
in
manetho
he
is
certainly
the
or
of
the
lists
and
the
of
manetho
in
both
the
lists
and
in
manetho
he
stands
fifth
in
order
from
mena
and
he
was
therefore
the
sixth
king
of
the
ist
dynasty
the
lists
manetho
and
the
small
monuments
in
his
own
tomb
agree
in
making
him
the
immediate
successor
of
semti
den
ousaphaïs
and
from
the
style
of
these
latter
it
is
evident
that
he
comes
after
tja
tjer
narmer
and
aha
that
is
to
say
the
contemporary
evidence
makes
him
the
fifth
king
from
aha
the
first
original
of
now
after
the
piety
of
seti
i
had
led
him
to
erect
a
great
temple
at
abydos
in
memory
of
the
ancient
kings
whose
sepulchres
had
probably
been
brought
to
light
shortly
before
and
to
compile
and
set
up
in
the
temple
a
list
of
his
predecessors
a
certain
pious
snobbery
or
snobbish
piety
impelled
a
worthy
named
tunure
who
lived
at
memphis
to
put
up
in
his
own
tomb
at
sakkâra
a
tablet
of
kings
like
the
royal
one
at
abydos
if
at
abydos
had
his
tablet
of
kings
so
should
at
sakkâra
but
tunure
does
not
begin
his
list
with
mena
his
initial
king
is
merpeba
for
him
merpeba
was
the
first
monarch
to
be
commemorated
at
sakkâra
does
not
this
look
very
much
as
if
the
strictly
historical
merpeba
not
the
rather
legendary
and
confused
mena
was
regarded
as
the
first
memphite
king
it
may
well
be
that
it
was
in
the
reign
of
merpeba
not
in
that
of
aha
or
narmer
that
memphis
was
founded
the
xixth
dynasty
lists
of
course
say
nothing
about
mena
or
merpeba
having
founded
memphis
they
only
give
the
names
of
the
kings
nothing
more
the
earliest
authority
for
the
ascription
of
memphis
to
is
herodotus
who
was
followed
in
this
ascription
as
in
many
other
matters
by
manetho
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
manetho
was
writing
for
the
edification
of
a
greek
king
ptolemy
philadelphus
and
his
greek
court
at
alexandria
and
had
therefore
to
evince
a
respect
for
the
great
greek
classic
which
he
may
not
always
have
really
felt
herodotus
is
not
of
course
accused
of
any
wilful
misstatement
in
this
or
in
any
other
matter
in
which
his
accuracy
is
suspected
he
merely
wrote
down
what
he
was
told
by
the
egyptians
themselves
and
merpeba
was
sufficiently
near
in
time
to
aha
to
be
easily
confounded
with
him
by
the
scribes
of
the
persian
period
who
no
doubt
ascribed
everything
to
that
was
done
by
the
kings
of
the
ist
and
iid
dynasties
therefore
it
may
be
considered
quite
probable
that
the
who
founded
memphis
was
merpeba
the
fifth
or
sixth
king
of
the
ist
dynasty
whom
tunure
a
thousand
years
before
the
time
of
herodotus
and
his
informants
placed
at
the
head
of
the
memphite
of
the
reconquest
of
the
north
by
khâsekhemui
doubtless
led
to
a
further
strengthening
of
memphis
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
deeds
of
this
king
also
contributed
to
make
up
the
sum
total
of
those
ascribed
to
the
herodotean
and
manethonian
menés
it
may
be
that
a
town
of
the
northerners
existed
here
before
the
time
of
the
southern
conquest
for
phtah
the
local
god
of
memphis
has
a
very
marked
character
of
his
own
quite
different
from
that
of
the
osiris
of
abydos
he
is
always
represented
as
a
little
hydrocephalous
dwarf
very
like
the
phoenician
it
may
be
that
here
is
another
connection
between
the
northern
egyptians
and
the
semites
the
name
the
is
definitely
semitic
we
may
then
regard
the
dwarf
phtah
as
originally
a
god
of
the
northerners
probably
semitic
in
origin
and
his
town
also
as
antedating
the
conquest
but
it
evidently
was
to
the
southerners
that
memphis
owed
its
importance
and
its
eventual
promotion
to
the
position
of
capital
of
the
united
kingdom
then
the
dwarf
phtah
saw
himself
rivalled
by
another
phtah
of
southern
egyptian
origin
who
had
been
installed
at
memphis
by
the
southerners
this
phtah
was
a
sort
of
modified
edition
of
osiris
in
and
holding
crook
and
whip
but
with
a
refined
edition
of
the
kabeiric
head
of
the
indigenous
phtah
the
actual
god
of
white
was
undoubtedly
confused
vith
the
dead
god
of
the
necropolis
whose
name
was
seker
or
sekri
sokari
the
original
form
of
this
deity
was
a
mummied
hawk
upon
a
coffin
and
it
is
very
probable
that
he
was
imported
from
the
south
like
the
second
phtah
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
when
the
great
northern
necropolis
began
to
grow
up
as
a
duplicate
of
that
at
abydos
later
on
we
find
seker
confused
with
the
ancient
and
it
is
the
latter
who
was
afterwards
chiefly
revered
as
the
protector
of
the
necropolis
the
mummied
phtah
being
the
generally
recognized
ruler
of
the
city
of
the
white
wall
it
is
from
the
name
of
seker
that
the
modern
takes
its
title

the

of

tjeser
of

a
pyramid
which
as
we
have
seen
was
probably
not
his
real
tomb
which
was
the
great
mastaba
at
bêt

but
a
secondary
or
sham
tomb
corresponding
to
the
of
the
earliest
kings
at
umm
in
the
necropolis
of
abydos
many
later
kings
however
especially
of
the
vith
dynasty
were
actually
buried
at
sakkâra
their
tombs
have
all
been
thoroughly
described
by
their
discoverer
maspero
in
his
history
the
last
king
of
the
hid
dynasty
snefru
was
buried
away
down
south
at
mêdûm
in
splendid
isolation
but
he
may
also
have
had
a
second
pyramid
at
sakkâra
or
abu
roash
the
kings
of
the
ivth
dynasty
were
the
greatest
of
the
pyramid
builders
and
to
them
belong
the
huge
edifices
of

favoured
abusîr
between

as
we
have
said
preferred

itself
with
them
the
end
of
the
old
kingdom
and
of
memphite
dominion
was
reached
the
sceptre
fell
from
the
hands
of
the
memphite
kings
and
was
taken
up
by
the
princes
of
herakleopolis
ahnasyet
near
béni
suêf
south
of
the
eayyûm
and
thebes
where
the
herakleopolite
kings
were
buried
we
do
not
know
probably
somewhere
in
the
local
necropolis
of
the
gebel
between
ahnasya
and
the
fayyûm
the
first
thebans
the
xith
dynasty
were
certainly
buried
at
thebes
but
when
the
herakleopolites
had
finally
disappeared
and
all
egypt
was
again
united
under
one
strong
sceptre
the
theban
kings
seem
to
have
been
drawn
northwards
they
removed
to
the
seat
of
the
dominion
of
those
whom
they
had
supplanted
and
they
settled
in
the
neighbourhood
of
herakleopolis
near
the
fertile
province
of
the
fayyûm
and
between
it
and
memphis
here
in
the
royal
of
the
two
lands
the
kings
of
the
xiith
dynasty
lived
and
they
were
buried
in
the
nécropoles
of
dashûr
lisht
and
illahun
hawara
in

like
those
of
the
old

these
facts
of

how

were
the

suffrages
of

how
anxious
they
were
to
conciliate
the
ancient
royal
pride
of

where
the
kings
of
the
xiiith

we
do

the

mostly
buried
in

the
sepulchres
of
the
the

dynasties
in

may
fairly
be
grouped
with
those
of

period
at
dashûr
which
belongs
to
the
necropolis
of
memphis
since
it
is
only
a
mile
or
two
south
of

it
is
chiefly
with
regard
to
the
sepulchres
of
the
kings
that
the
most
momentous
discoveries
of
recent
years
have
been
made
at
thebes
and
at
sakkâra
abusîr
dashûr
and
lisht
as
at
abydos
for
this
reason
we
deal
in
succession
with
the
finds
in
the
nécropoles
of
abydos
memphis
and
thebes
respectively
and
with
the
sepulchres
of
the
kingdom
in
the
memphite
necropolis
proper
we
have
naturally
grouped
those
of
the
at
dashûr
lisht
illahun
and
hawara
some
of
these
modern
discoveries
have
been
commented
on
and
illustrated
by
maspero
in
his
great
history
but
the
discoveries
that
have
been
made
since
this
publication
have
been
very
important
those
at
abusîr
indeed
of
importance
though
not
so
momentous
as
those
of
the
tombs
of
the
ist
and
iid
dynasties
at
abydos
already
described
at
abu
roash
and
at
gîza
at
the
northern
end
of
the
memphite
necropolis
several
expeditions
have
had
considerable
success
notably
those
of
the
american
reisner
assisted
by
mace
who
excavated
the
royal
tombs
at
umm
for
petrie
those
of
the
german
drs
steindorff
and
borchardt
the
latter
working
for
the
and
those
of
other
american
excavators
until
the
full
publication
of
the
results
of
these
excavations
appears
very
little
can
be
said
about
them
many
have
it
is
understood
been
found
with
interesting
remains
nothing
of
great
historical
importance
seems
to
have
been
discovered
however
it
is
otherwise
when
we
come
to
the
discoveries
of
borchardt
and
schâfer
at
abusîr
south
of
gîza
and
north
of
sakkâra
at
this
place
results
of
historical
importance
have
been
attained
the
main
group
of
pyramids
at
abusir
consists
of
the
tombs
of
the
kings
sahurà
neferarikarâ
and
of
the
vth
dynasty
the
pyramids
themselves
are
smaller
than
those
of
gîza
but
larger
than
those
of
sakkâra
in
general
appearance
and
effect
they
resemble
those
of
gîza
but
they
are
not
so
imposing
as
the
desert
here
is
low
those
of
gîza
sakkâra
and
dashûr
owe
much
of
their
impressiveness
to
the
fact
that
they
are
placed
at
some
height
above
the
cultivated
land
the
excavation
and
planning
of
these
pyramids
were
carried
out
by
borchardt
and
schâfer
at
the
expense
of
baron
von
bissing
the
egyptologist
of
munich
and
of
the
of
berlin
the
antiquities
found
have
been
divided
between
the
museums
of
berlin
and
cairo
one
of
the
most
noteworthy
discoveries
was
that
of
the
funerary
temple
of
which
stood
at
the
base
of
his
pyramid
the
plan
is
interesting
and
the
granite
columns
found
are
the
most
ancient
yet
discovered
in
egypt
much
of
the
paving
and
the
wainscoting
of
the
walls
was
of
fine
black
marble
beautifully
polished
an
interesting
find
was
a
basin
and
drain
with
mouth
to
carry
away
the
blood
of
the
sacrifices
some
sculptures
in
relief
were
discovered
including
a
gigantic
representation
of
the
king
and
the
goddess
isis
which
shows
that
in
the
early
days
of
the
vth
dynasty
the
king
and
the
gods
were
already
depicted
in
exactly
the
same
costume
as
they
wore
in
the
days
of
the
ramses
and
the
ptolemies
the
hieratic
art
of
egypt
had
in
fact
now
taken
on
itself
the
final
outward
appearance
which
it
retained
to
the
very
end
there
is
no
more
of
the
archaism
and
absence
of
conventionality
which
marks
the
art
of
the
earliest
dynasties
we
can
trace
by
successive
steps
the
swift
development
of
egyptian
art
from
the
rude
archaism
of
the
ist
dynasty
to
its
final
consummation
under
the
vth
when
the
conventions
became
fixed
in
the
time
of
khäsekhemui
at
the
beginning
of
the
iid
dynasty
the
archaic
character
of
the
art
has
already
begun
to
wear
off
under
the
same
dynasty
we
still
have
styles
of
unconventional
naïveté
such
as
the
famous
statue
of
the
cairo
museum
bearing
the
names
of
kings
hetepahaui
and
neneter
but
with
the
ivth
dynasty
we
no
longer
look
for
unconventionality
petrie
discovered
at
abydos
a
small
ivory
statuette
of
khufu
or
cheops
the
builder
of
the
great
pyramid
of
gîza
the
portrait
is
a
good
one
and
carefully
executed
it
was
not
till
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
indeed
that
the
egyptians
ceased
to
portray
their
kings
as
they
really
were
and
gave
them
a
purely
conventional
type
of
face
this
convention
against
which
the
heretical
king
amenhetep
iv
akhunaten
rebelled
in
order
to
have
himself
portrayed
in
all
his
real
ungainliness
and
ugliness
did
not
exist
till
long
after
the
time
of
the
ivth
and
vth
dynasties
illustration
statue
no
of
the
cairo
museum
about
the
kings
of
the
xiith
dynasty
especially
were
most
careful
that
their
statues
should
be
accurate
portraits
indeed
the
portraits
of
usertsen
senusret
iii
vary
from
a
young
face
to
an
old
one
showing
that
the
king
was
faithfully
depicted
at
different
periods
of
his
life
but
the
general
conventions
of
dress
and
deportment
were
finally
fixed
under
the
vth
dynasty
after
this
time
we
no
longer
have
such
absolutely
faithful
and
original
presentments
as
the
other
little
ivory
statuette
found
by
petrie
at
abydos
now
in
the
british
museum
which
shows
us
an
aged
monarch
of
the
ist
dynasty
it
is
obvious
that
the
features
are
absolutely
true
to
life
and
the
figure
wears
an
unconventionally
and
bordered
robe
of
a
kind
which
kings
of
a
later
day
may
have
worn
in
actual
life
but
which
they
would
assuredly
never
be
depicted
as
wearing
by
the
artists
of
their
day
to
the
end
of
egyptian
history
the
kings
even
the
roman
emperors
were
represented
on
the
monuments
clothed
in
the
official
costume
of
their
ancestors
of
the
ivth
and
vth
dynasties
in
the
same
manner
as
we
see
khufu
wearing
his
robe
in
the
little
figure
from
abydos
and
on
the
great
relief
from
abusîr
there
are
one
or
two
exceptions
such
as
the
representations
of
the
original
genius
akhunaten
at
tell
and
the
beautiful
statue
of
ramses
ii
at
turin
in
which
we
see
these
kings
wearing
the
real
costume
of
their
time
but
such
exceptions
are
very
rare
the
art
of
abusîr
is
therefore
of
great
interest
since
it
marks
the
end
of
the
development
of
the
priestly
art
secular
art
might
develop
as
it
liked
though
the
crystallizing
influence
of
the
ecclesiastical
canon
is
always
evident
here
also
but
henceforward
it
was
an
impiety
which
only
an
akhunaten
could
commit
to
depict
a
king
or
a
god
on
the
walls
of
a
temple
otherwise
except
so
far
as
the
portrait
was
concerned
than
as
he
had
been
depicted
in
the
time
of
the
vth
dynasty
other
buildings
have
been
excavated
by
the
germans
at
abusîr
notably
the
usual
town
of
belonging
to
the
chief
dignitaries
of
the
reign
which
is
always
found
at
the
foot
of
a
royal
pyramid
of
this
period
another
building
of
the
highest
interest
belonging
to
the
same
age
was
also
excavated
and
its
true
character
was
determined
this
is
a
building
at
a
place
called
or
abû
ghuraib
of
crows
between
abusîr
and
gîza
it
was
formerly
supposed
to
be
a
pyramid
but
the
german
excavations
have
shown
that
it
is
really
a
temple
of
the
râ
of
heliopolis
specially
venerated
by
the
kings
of
the
vth
dynasty
who
were
of
heliopolitan
origin
the
great
of
the
ivth
dynasty
seem
to
have
been
the
last
true
memphites
at
the
end
of
the
reign
of
shepseskaf
the
last
monarch
of
the
dynasty
the
sceptre
passed
to
a
heliopolitan
family
the
following
vith
dynasty
may
again
have
been
memphite
but
this
is
uncertain
the
capital
continued
to
be
memphis
and
from
the
beginning
of
the
hid
dynasty
to
the
end
of
the
old
kingdom
and
the
rise
of
and
thebes
memphis
remained
the
chief
city
of
egypt
the
heliopolitans
were
naturally
the
servants
of
the
above
all
other
gods
and
they
were
the
first
to
call
themselves
of
the
sun
a
title
retained
by
the
pharaohs
throughout
all
subsequent
history
it
was
who
built
the
of
abu
ghuraib
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
north
of
his
pyramid
and
those
of
his
two
immediate
predecessors
at
abusir
as
now
laid
bare
by
the
excavations
of
it
is
seen
to
consist
of
an
artificial
mound
with
a
great
court
in
front
to
the
eastward
on
the
mound
was
erected
a
truncated
obelisk
the
stone
emblem
of
the
the
worshippers
in
the
court
below
looked
towards
the
stone
erected
upon
its
mound
in
the
west
the
quarter
of
the
setting
for
the
of
heliopolis
was
primarily
the
setting
sun
not
râ
harmachis
the
rising
sun
whose
emblem
is
the
great
sphinx
at
gîza
which
looks
towards
the
east
the
sacred
emblem
of
the
heliopolitan
reminds
us
forcibly
of
the
semitic
or
the
sacred
stones
of
palestine
and
may
give
yet
another
hint
of
the
semitic
origin
of
the
heliopolitan
cult
in
the
court
of
the
temple
is
a
huge
circular
altar
of
fine
alabaster
several
feet
across
on
which
slain
oxen
were
offered
to
the
sun
and
behind
this
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
court
are
six
great
basins
of
the
same
stone
over
which
the
beasts
were
slain
with
drains
running
out
of
them
by
which
their
blood
was
carried
away
this
temple
is
a
most
interesting
monument
of
the
civilization
of
the
at
the
time
of
the
vth
dynasty
at
sakkâra
itself
which
lies
a
short
distance
south
of
abusir
no
new
royal
tombs
have
as
has
been
said
been
discovered
of
late
years
but
a
great
deal
of
work
has
been
done
among
the
private
by
the
officers
of
the
des
which
reserves
to
itself
the
right
of
excavation
here
and
at
dashûr
the
mastaba
of
the
sage
and
writer
kagernna
or
rather
gemnika
which
sounds
very
like
an
american
indian
appellation
is
very
fine
lived
in
the
reign
of
the
king
tatkarâ
assa
the
of
manetho
and
he
wrote
maxims
like
his
great
contemporary
phtahhetep
to
who
was
also
buried
at
sakkâra
the
officials
of
the
des
who
cleaned
the
tomb
unluckily
misread
his
name
an
impossible
form
which
could
only
mean
literally
translated
or
and
they
have
placed
it
in
this
form
over
the
entrance
to
his
tomb
this
mastaba
like
those
already
known
of
mereruka
sometimes
misnamed
and
the
famous
ti
both
also
at
sakkâra
contains
a
large
number
of
chambers
ornamented
with
reliefs
in
the
vicinity
grébaut
then
director
of
the
service
of
antiquities
discovered
a
very
interesting
street
of
tombs
a
regular
via
sacra
with
rows
of
tombs
of
the
dignitaries
of
the
vith
dynasty
on
either
side
of
it
they
are
generally
very
much
like
one
another
the
workmanship
of
the
reliefs
is
fine
and
the
portrait
of
the
owner
of
the
tomb
is
always
in
evidence
several
of
the
smaller
mastabas
have
lately
been
disposed
of
to
the
various
museums
as
they
are
liable
to
damage
if
they
remain
where
they
stand
moreover
they
are
not
of
great
value
to
the
museum
of
cairo
but
are
of
considerable
value
to
various
museums
which
do
not
already
possess
complete
specimens
of
this
class
of
tombs
a
fine
one
belonging
to
the
chief
uerarina
is
now
exhibited
in
the
assyrian
basement
of
the
british
museum
another
is
in
the
museum
of
leyden
a
third
at
berlin
and
so
on
most
of
these
are
simple
tombs
of
one
chamber
in
the
centre
of
the
rear
wall
we
always
see
the
or
gravestone
proper
built
into
the
fabric
of
the
tomb
before
this
stood
the
low
table
of
offerings
with
a
bowl
for
oblations
and
on
either
side
a
tall
from
the
altar
the
divine
smoke
arose
when
the
or
priest
of
the
ghost
literally
performed
his
duty
of
venerating
the
spirits
of
the
deceased
while
the
or
cantor
enveloped
in
the
mystic
folds
of
the
and
with
bronze
in
hand
sang
the
holy
litanies
and
spells
which
should
propitiate
the
ghost
and
enable
him
to
win
his
way
to
ultimate
perfection
in
the
next
world
the
stele
is
always
in
the
form
of
a
door
with
cornice
on
either
side
is
a
figure
of
the
deceased
and
at
the
sides
are
carved
prayers
to
anubis
and
at
a
later
date
to
osiris
who
are
implored
to
give
the
funerary
meats
and
good
and
pure
on
which
the
god
there
as
the
dead
man
in
the
tomb
has
been
constituted
lives
often
we
find
that
the
biography
and
list
of
honorary
titles
and
dignities
of
the
deceased
have
been
added
sakkâra
was
used
as
a
place
of
burial
in
the
latest
as
well
as
in
the
earliest
time
the
egyptians
of
the
xxvith
dynasty
wearied
of
the
long
decadence
and
devastating
wars
which
had
followed
the
glorious
epoch
of
the
conquering
pharaohs
of
the
xviiith
and
xixth
dynasties
turned
for
a
new
and
refreshing
inspiration
to
the
works
of
the
most
ancient
kings
when
egypt
was
a
simple
country
holding
no
intercourse
with
outside
lands
bearing
no
outside
burdens
for
the
sake
of
pomp
and
glory
and
knowing
nothing
of
the
decay
and
decadence
which
follows
in
the
train
of
earthly
power
and
grandeur
they
deliberately
turned
their
backs
on
the
and
discredited
imperial
trappings
of
the
thothmes
and
ramses
and
they
took
the
supposed
primitive
simplicity
of
the
snefrus
the
khufus
and
the
for
a
model
and
ensampler
to
their
lives
it
was
an
age
of
conscious
and
intended
archaism
and
in
pursuit
of
the
archaistic
ideal
the
of
the
saïte
age
had
themselves
buried
in
the
ancient
necropolis
of
sakkâra
side
by
side
with
their
ancestors
of
the
time
of
the
vth
and
vith
dynasties
several
of
these
tombs
have
lately
been
discovered
and
opened
and
fitted
with
modern
improvements
one
or
two
of
them
of
the
persian
period
have
wells
leading
to
the
sepulchral
chamber
of
enormous
depth
down
which
the
modern
tourist
is
enabled
to
descend
by
a
spiral
iron
staircase
the
serapeum
itself
is
lit
with
electricity
and
in
the
tombs
of
the
kings
at
thebes
nothing
disturbs
the
silence
but
the
steady
thumping
pulsation
of
the
which
lights
the
ancient
sepulchres
of
the
pharaohs
thus
do
modern
ideas
and
inventions
help
us
to
see
and
so
to
understand
better
the
works
of
ancient
egypt
but
it
is
perhaps
a
little
too
much
like
the
yankee
at
the
court
of
king
arthur
the
interiors
of
the
later
tombs
are
often
decorated
with
reliefs
which
imitate
those
of
the
early
period
but
with
a
kind
of
delicate
grace
which
at
once
marks
them
for
what
they
are
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
confound
them
with
the
genuine
ancient
originals
from
which
they
were
adapted
riding
from
sakkâra
southwards
to
dashûr
we
pass
on
the
way
the
gigantic
stone
mastaba
known
as
the
this
was
considered
to
be
the
tomb
of
the
vth
dynasty
king
unas
until
his
pyramid
was
found
by
maspero
at
sakkâra
from
its
form
it
might
be
thought
to
belong
to
a
monarch
of
the
hid
dynasty
but
the
great
size
of
the
stone
blocks
of
which
it
is
built
seems
to
point
rather
to
the
xiith
all
attempts
to
penetrate
its
secret
by
actual
excavation
have
been
unavailing
further
south
across
the
desert
we
see
from
the
mastabat
four
distinct
pyramids
symmetrically
arranged
in
two
lines
two
in
each
line
the
two
to
the
right
are
great
stone
erections
of
the
usual
type
like
those
of
gîza
and
abusîr
and
the
southernmost
of
them
has
a
peculiar
appearance
due
to
the
alteration
of
the
angle
of
inclination
of
its
sides
during
construction
further
it
is
covered
almost
to
the
ground
by
the
original
casing
of
polished
white
limestone
blocks
so
that
it
gives
a
very
good
idea
of
the
original
appearance
of
the
other
pyramids
which
have
lost
their
casing
these
two
pyramids
very
probably
belong
to
kings
of
the
hid
dynasty
as
does
the
of
sakkâra
they
strongly
resemble
the
gîza
type
and
the
northernmost
of
the
two
looks
very
like
an
understudy
of
the
great
pyramid
it
seems
to
mark
the
step
in
the
development
of
the
royal
pyramid
which
was
immediately
followed
by
the
great
pyramid
but
no
excavations
have
yet
proved
the
accuracy
of
this
view
both
pyramids
have
been
entered
but
nothing
has
been
found
in
them
it
is
very
probable
that
one
of
them
is
the
second
pyramid
of
snefru
the
other
two
pyramids
those
nearest
the
cultivation
are
of
very
different
appearance
they
are
they
are
black

about

use
of
brick
for
the
royal
tombs
was
a
return
to
the
custom
of
earlier
days
for
from
the
time
of
aha
to
that
tjeser
from
the
dynasty
to
the
hid
brick
had
been
used
for
the
building

the
royal
out
of
which
the
pyramids
had
developed
at
this
point
where
we
take
leave
of
the
great
pyramids
of
the
old
kingdom
we
may
notice
the
latest
theory
as
to
the
building
of
these
monuments
which
has
of
late
years
been
enunciated
by
borchardt
and
is
now
generally
accepted
the
great
prussian
explorer
lepsius
when
he
examined
the
pyramids
in
the
came
to
the
conclusion
that
each
king
when
he
ascended
the
throne
planned
a
small
pyramid
for
himself
this
was
built
in
a
few
time
and
if
his
reign
were
short
or
if
he
were
unable
to
enlarge
the
pyramid
for
other
reasons
it
sufficed
for
his
tomb
if
however
his
reign
seemed
likely
to
be
one
of
some
length
after
the
first
plan
was
completed
he
enlarged
his
pyramid
by
building
another
and
a
larger
one
around
it
and
over
it
then
again
when
this
addition
was
finished
and
the
king
still
reigned
and
was
in
possession
of
great
resources
yet
another
coating
so
to
speak
was
put
on
to
the
pyramid
and
so
on
till
colossal
structures
like
the
first
and
second
pyramid
of
giza
which
we
know
belonged
to
kings
who
were
unusually
were
completed
and
finally
the
aged
monarch
died
and
was
buried
in
the
huge
tomb
which
his
long
life
and
his
great
power
had
enabled
him
to
erect
this
view
appeared
eminently
reasonable
at
the
time
and
it
seemed
almost
as
though
we
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
whether
a
king
had
reigned
long
or
not
by
the
size
of
his
pyramid
and
even
to
obtain
a
rough
idea
of
the
length
of
his
reign
by
counting
the
successive
coats
or
accretions
which
it
had
received
much
as
we
tell
the
age
of
a
tree
by
the
rings
in
its
bole
a
pyramid
seemed
to
have
been
constructed
something
after
the
manner
of
an
onion
or
a
chinese
pétrie
however
who
examined
the
griza
pyramids
in
and
carefully
measured
them
all
up
and
finally
settled
their
trigonometrical
relation
came
to
the
conclusion
that
theory
was
entirely
erroneous
and
that
every
pyramid
was
built
and
now
stands
as
it
was
originally
planned
illustration
the
pyramids
of
giza
during
the
inundation
borchardt
however
who
is
an
architect
by
profession
has
examined
the
pyramids
again
and
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
statement
is
not
correct
and
that
there
is
an
element
of
truth
in
hypothesis
he
has
shown
that
several
of
the
pyramids
notably
the
first
and
second
at
giza
show
unmistakable
signs
of
a
modified
altered
and
enlarged
plan
in
fact
kings
like
khufu
seem
to
have
added
considerably
to
their
pyramids
and
even
to
have
entirely
remodelled
them
on
a
larger
scale
this
has
certainly
been
the
case
with
the
great
pyramid
we
can
then
accept
theory
as
modified
by
borchardt
another
interesting
point
has
arisen
in
connection
with
the
great
pyramid
considerable
difference
of
opinion
has
always
existed
between
egyptologists
and
the
professors
of
european
archaeology
with
regard
to
the
antiquity
of
the
knowledge
of
iron
in
egypt
the
majority
of
the
egyptologists
have
always
maintained
on
the
authority
of
the
inscriptions
that
iron
was
known
to
the
ancient
egyptians
from
the
earliest
period
they
argued
that
the
word
for
a
certain
metal
in
old
egyptian
was
the
same
as
the
coptic
word
for
they
stated
that
in
the
most
ancient
religious
texts
the
egyptians
spoke
of
the
firmament
of
heaven
as
made
of
this
metal
and
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
because
this
metal
was
blue
in
colour
the
hue
of
iron
or
steel
and
they
further
pointed
out
that
some
of
the
weapons
in
the
were
painted
blue
and
others
red
some
being
of
iron
that
is
to
say
others
of
copper
or
bronze
finally
they
brought
forward
as
incontrovertible
evidence
an
actual
fragment
of
worked
iron
which
had
been
found
between
two
of
the
inner
blocks
down
one
of
the
in
the
great
pyramid
here
was
an
actual
piece
of
iron
of
the
time
of
the
ivth
dynasty
about
this
conclusion
was
never
accepted
by
the
students
of
the
development
of
the
use
of
metal
in
prehistoric
europe
when
they
came
to
know
of
it
no
doubt
their
incredulity
was
partly
due
to
want
of
appreciation
of
the
egyptological
evidence
partly
to
disinclination
to
accept
a
conclusion
which
did
not
at
all
agree
with
the
knowledge
they
had
derived
from
their
own
study
of
prehistoric
europe
in
southern
europe
it
was
quite
certain
that
iron
did
not
come
into
use
till
about
in
central
europe
where
the
discoveries
at
hallstatt
in
the
salzkammergut
exhibit
the
transition
from
the
age
of
bronze
to
that
of
iron
about
the
exclusively
iron
age
culture
of
la
tène
can
not
be
dated
earlier
than
the
eighth
century
if
as
early
as
that
how
then
was
it
possible
that
if
iron
had
been
known
to
the
egyptians
as
early
as
its
knowledge
should
not
have
been
communicated
to
the
europeans
until
over
two
thousand
years
later
no
iron
could
not
have
been
really
known
to
the
egyptians
much
before
and
the
egyptological
evidence
was
all
wrong
this
line
of
argument
was
taken
by
the
distinguished
swedish
archaeologist
oscar
montelius
of
upsala
whose
previous
experience
in
dealing
with
the
antiquities
of
northern
europe
great
as
it
was
was
hardly
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
pronounce
with
authority
on
a
point
affecting
african
egypt
and
when
dealing
with
greek
prehistoric
antiquities
views
have
hardly
met
with
that
ready
agreement
which
all
acknowledge
to
be
his
due
when
he
is
giving
us
the
results
of
his
ripe
knowledge
of
northern
antiquities
he
has
in
fact
forgotten
as
most
archaeologists
do
forget
that
the
antiquities
of
scandinavia
greece
egypt
the
semites
the
of
benin
the
miners
of
zimbabwe
and
the
ohio
are
not
to
be
treated
all
together
as
a
whole
and
that
hard
and
fast
lines
of
development
can
not
be
laid
down
for
them
based
on
the
experience
of
scandinavia
we
may
perhaps
trace
this
misleading
habit
of
thought
to
the
influence
of
the
professors
of
natural
science
over
the
students
of
stone
age
and
bronze
age
antiquities
because
nature
moves
by
steady
progression
and
develops
on
even
lines
facit
per
it
seems
to
have
been
assumed
that
the
works
of
hands
have
developed
in
the
same
way
in
a
regular
and
even
scheme
all
over
the
world
on
this
supposition
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
great
discovery
of
the
use
of
iron
to
have
been
known
in
egypt
as
early
as
for
this
knowledge
to
have
remained
dormant
there
for
two
thousand
years
and
then
to
have
been
suddenly
communicated
about
to
greece
spreading
with
rapidity
over
europe
and
displacing
the
use
of
bronze
everywhere
yet
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
work
of
man
does
develop
in
exactly
this
haphazard
way
by
fits
and
starts
and
sudden
leaps
of
progress
after
millennia
of
stagnation
throwsback
to
barbarism
are
just
as
frequent
the
analogy
of
natural
evolution
is
completely
inapplicable
and
misleading
montelius
however
following
the
line
of
thought
believed
that
because
iron
was
not
known
in
europe
till
about
it
could
not
have
been
known
in
egypt
much
earlier
and
in
an
important
article
which
appeared
in
the
swedish
ethnological
journal
in
entitled
i
bronze
age
in
he
essayed
to
prove
the
contrary
arguments
of
the
egyptologists
wrong
his
main
points
were
that
the
colour
of
the
weapons
in
the
frescoes
was
of
no
importance
as
it
was
purely
conventional
and
arbitrary
and
that
the
evidence
of
the
piece
of
iron
from
the
great
pyramid
was
insufficiently
authenticated
and
therefore
valueless
in
the
absence
of
other
definite
archaeological
evidence
in
the
shape
of
iron
of
supposed
early
date
to
this
article
the
swedish
egyptologist
piehl
replied
in
the
same
periodical
in
an
article
entitled
i
in
which
he
traversed
conclusions
from
the
egyptological
point
of
view
and
adduced
other
instances
of
the
use
of
iron
in
egypt
all
it
is
true
later
than
the
time
of
the
ivth
dynasty
but
this
protest
received
little
notice
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
remained
buried
in
a
swedish
periodical
while
original
article
was
translated
into
french
and
so
became
for
the
time
conclusions
were
generally
accepted
and
when
the
discoveries
of
the
prehistoric
antiquities
were
made
by
de
morgan
it
seemed
more
probable
than
ever
that
egypt
had
gone
through
a
regular
progressive
development
from
the
age
of
stone
through
those
of
copper
and
bronze
to
that
of
iron
which
was
reached
about
or
the
evidence
of
the
iron
fragment
from
the
great
pyramid
was
put
on
one
side
in
spite
of
the
circumstantial
account
of
its
discovery
which
had
been
given
by
its
finders
even
pétrie
who
in
had
accepted
the
pyramid
fragment
as
undoubtedly
contemporary
with
that
building
and
had
gone
so
far
as
to
adduce
additional
evidence
for
its
authenticity
gave
way
and
accepted
view
which
held
its
own
until
in
it
was
directly
controverted
by
a
discovery
of
pétrie
at
abydos
this
discovery
consisted
of
an
undoubted
fragment
of
iron
found
in
conjunction
with
bronze
tools
of
vith
dynasty
date
and
it
settled
the
matter
the
vith
dynasty
date
of
this
piece
of
iron
which
was
more
probably
worked
than
not
since
it
was
buried
with
tools
was
held
to
be
undoubted
by
its
discoverer
and
by
everybody
else
and
if
this
were
undoubted
the
ivth
dynasty
date
of
the
great
pyramid
fragment
was
also
fully
established
the
discoverers
of
the
earlier
fragment
had
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
its
being
contemporary
with
the
pyramid
and
were
supported
in
this
by
pétrie
in
therefore
it
is
now
known
to
be
the
fact
that
iron
was
used
by
the
egyptians
as
early
as
see
note
on
early
use
of
iron
in
egypt
in
the
organ
of
the
anthropological
society
of
london
iii
no
montelius
objected
to
these
conclusions
in
a
review
of
the
british
museum
to
the
antiquities
of
the
bronze
age
which
was
published
in
man
no
for
an
answer
to
these
objections
see
hall
no
it
would
thus
appear
that
though
the
egyptians
can
not
be
said
to
have
used
iron
generally
and
so
to
have
entered
the
before
about
reign
of
ramses
ii
yet
iron
was
well
known
to
them
and
had
been
used
more
than
occasionally
by
them
for
tools
and
building
purposes
as
early
as
the
time
of
the
ivth
dynasty
about
certainly
dated
examples
of
its
use
occur
under
the
ivth
vith
and
xiiith
dynasties
why
this
knowledge
was
not
communicated
to
europe
before
about
we
can
not
say
nor
are
egyptologists
called
upon
to
find
the
reason
so
the
great
pyramid
has
played
an
interesting
part
in
the
settlement
of
a
very
important
question
it
was
supposed
by
pétrie
that
the
piece
of
iron
from
the
great
pyramid
had
been
part
of
some
arrangement
employed
for
raising
the
stones
into
position
herodotus
speaks
of
the
machines
which
were
used
to
raise
the
stones
as
made
of
little
pieces
of
wood
the
generally
accepted
explanation
of
his
meaning
used
to
be
that
a
small
crane
or
similar
wooden
machine
was
used
for
hoisting
the
stone
by
means
of
pulley
and
rope
but
legrain
the
director
of
the
works
of
restoration
in
the
great
temple
of
karnak
has
explained
it
differently
among
the
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
at
dêr
and
elsewhere
beside
the
little
plaques
with
the
name
and
the
model
hoes
and
vases
was
usually
found
an
enigmatic
wooden
object
like
a
small
cradle
with
two
sides
made
of
semicircular
pieces
of
wood
joined
along
the
curved
portion
by
round
wooden
bars
legrain
has
now
explained
this
as
a
model
of
the
machine
used
to
raise
heavy
stones
from
tier
to
tier
of
a
pyramid
or
other
building
and
illustrations
of
the
method
of
its
use
may
be
found
in
de
bâtir
chez
les
anciens
there
is
little
doubt
that
this
primitive
machine
is
that
to
which
herodotus
refers
as
having
been
used
in
the
erection
of
the
pyramids
the
later
historian
diodorus
also
tells
us
that
great
mounds
or
ramps
of
earth
were
used
as
well
and
that
the
stones
were
dragged
up
these
to
the
requisite
height
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
statement
also
is
correct
we
know
that
the
egyptians
did
build
in
this
very
way
and
the
system
has
been
revived
by
legrain
for
his
work
at
karnak
where
still
exist
the
remains
of
the
actual
mounds
and
ramps
by
which
the
great
western
pylon
was
erected
in
ptolemaïc
times
work
carried
on
in
this
way
is
slow
and
expensive
but
it
is
eminently
suited
to
the
country
and
understood
by
the
people
if
they
wish
to
put
a
great
stone
architrave
weighing
many
tons
across
the
top
of
two
columns
they
do
not
hoist
it
up
into
position
they
rear
a
great
ramp
or
embankment
of
earth
against
the
two
pillars
them
in
the
process
then
drag
the
architrave
up
the
ramp
by
means
of
ropes
and
men
and
put
it
into
position
then
the
ramp
is
cleared
away
this
is
the
ancient
system
which
is
now
followed
at
karnak
and
it
is
the
system
by
which
with
the
further
aid
of
the
wooden
machines
the
great
pyramid
and
its
compeers
were
erected
in
the
days
of
the
ivth
dynasty

as
at
neither
place
is
his
name
found
alone
at
hawara
it
is
found
in
conjunction
with
that
of
his
daughter
the
skemiophris
at
dashûr
with
that
of
a
king
auabrâ
hor
who
was
buried
in
a
small
tomb
near
that
of
the
king
and
adjoining
the
tombs
of
the
children
who
king
hor
was
we
do
not
quite
know
his
name
is
not
given
in
the
lists
and
was
unknown
until
de
discoveries
at
dashûr
it
is
most
probable
that
he
was
a
prince
who
was
given
royal
honours
during
the
lifetime
of
amenemhat
iii
whom
he
predeceased
in
the
beautiful
wooden
statue
of
him
found
in
his
tomb
which
is
now
in
the
cairo
museum
he
is
represented
as
quite
a
youth
amenemhat
iii
was
certainly
succeeded
by
amenemhat
iv
and
it
is
impossible
to
intercalate
hor
between
them
see
below
possibly
he
was
a
son
of
amenemhat
iii
the
identification
of
the
owners
of
the
three
western
pyramids
of
dashûr
is
due
to
de
morgan
and
his
assistants
legrain
and
jéquier
who
excavated
them
from
till
the
northern
pyramid
that
of
usertsen
senusret
iii
is
not
so
well
preserved
as
the
southern
it
is
more
worn
away
and
does
not
present
so
imposing
an
appearance
in
both
pyramids
the
outer
casing
of
white
stone
has
entirely
disappeared
leaving
only
the
bare
black
bricks
each
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
great
necropolis
of
dignitaries
of
the
period
as
was
usually
the
case
many
of
the
mastabas
were
excavated
by
de
morgan
some
are
of
older
periods
than
the
xiith
dynasty
one
belonging
to
a
priest
of
king
snefru
who
bore
the
additional
titles
of
of
prophets
and
general
of
there
were
pluralists
even
in
those
days
and
the
distinction
between
the
privy
councillor
geheimrat
and
real
privy
councillor
was
quite
familiar
for
we
find
it
actually
made
many
an
old
egyptian
officially
priding
himself
in
his
tomb
on
having
been
a
real
privy
councillor
the
egyptian
bureaucracy
was
already
ancient
and
had
its
survivals
and
its
anomalies
even
as
early
as
the
time
of
the
in
front
of
the
pyramid
of
usertsen
senusret
iii
at
one
time
stood
the
usual
funerary
temple
but
it
has
been
totally
destroyed
by
the
side
of
the
pyramid
were
buried
some
of
the
princesses
of
the
royal
family
in
a
series
of
tombs
opening
out
of
a
subterranean
gallery
and
in
this
gallery
were
found
the
wonderful
jewels
of
the
princesses
and
merit
which
are
among
the
greatest
treasures
of
the
cairo
museum
those
who
have
not
seen
them
can
obtain
a
perfect
idea
of
their
appearance
from
the
beautiful
paintings
of
them
by
legrain
which
are
published
in
de
work
on
the
à
vienna
altogether
one
hundred
and
seven
objects
were
recovered
consisting
of
all
kinds
of
jewelry
in
gold
and
coloured
stones
among
the
most
beautiful
are
the
great
or
in
the
shape
of
pylons
with
the
names
of
usertsen
ii
usertsen
iii
and
amenemhat
iii
the
names
are
surrounded
by
hawks
standing
on
the
sign
for
gold
gryphons
figures
of
the
king
striking
down
enemies
all
in
work
with
beautiful
stones
such
as
lapis
lazuli
green
felspar
and
carnelian
taking
the
place
of
coloured
enamels
the
massive
chains
of
golden
beads
and
cowries
are
also
very
remarkable
these
treasures
had
been
buried
in
boxes
in
the
floor
of
the
subterranean
gallery
and
had
luckily
escaped
the
notice
of
plunderers
and
so
by
a
fortunate
chance
have
survived
to
tell
us
what
the
egyptian
jewellers
could
do
in
the
days
of
the
xiith
dynasty
here
also
were
found
two
great
nile
barges
boats
with
their
oars
and
other
gear
complete
they
also
may
be
seen
in
the
museum
of
cairo
it
can
only
be
supposed
that
they
had
served
as
the
biers
of
the
royal
mummies
and
had
been
brought
up
in
state
on
sledges
the
actual
royal
chamber
was
not
found
although
a
subterranean
gallery
was
driven
beneath
the
centre
of
the
pyramid
the
southern
brick
pyramid
was
constructed
in
the
same
way
as
the
northern
one
at
the
side
of
it
were
also
found
the
tombs
of
members
of
the
royal
house
including
that
of
the
king
hor
already
mentioned
with
its
interesting
contents
the
remains
of
the
mummy
of
this
ephemeral
monarch
known
only
from
his
tomb
were
also
found
the
entrails
of
the
king
were
placed
in
the
usual
jars
which
were
sealed
with
the
seal
of
amenemhat
iii
it
is
thus
that
we
know
that
hor
died
before
him
in
many
of
the
inscriptions
of
this
king
on
his
coffin
and
stelo
a
peculiarly
affected
manner
of
writing
the
hieroglyphs
is
found
the
birds
are
without
their
legs
the
snake
has
no
tail
the
bee
no
head
birds
are
found
without
their
legs
in
other
inscriptions
of
this
period
it
was
a
temporary
fashion
and
soon
discarded
in
the
tomb
of
a
princess
named
nubhetep
near
at
hand
were
found
more
jewels
of
the
same
style
as
those
of
and
merit
the
pyramid
itself
contained
the
usual
passages
and
chambers
which
were
reached
with
much
difficulty
and
considerable
tunnelling
by
de
morgan
in
fact
the
search
for
the
royal
lasted
from
december
till
march
when
the
gallery
finally
struck
one
of
the
ancient
passages
which
were
found
to
be
unusually
extensive
contrasting
in
this
respect
with
the
northern
pyramid
the
royal
had
of
course
been
emptied
of
what
it
contained
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
any
case
it
is
probable
that
the
king
was
not
actually
buried
here
but
in
the
pyramid
of
hawara
the
pyramid
of
amenemhat
ii
which
lies
between
the
two
brick
pyramids
was
built
entirely
of
stone
nothing
of
it
remains
above
ground
but
the
investigation
of
the
subterranean
portions
showed
that
it
was
remarkable
for
the
massiveness
of
its
stones
and
the
care
with
which
the
masonry
was
executed
the
same
characteristics
are
found
in
the
dependent
tombs
of
the
princesses
ha
and
khnumet
in
which
more
jewelry
was
found
this
splendid
stonework
is
characteristic
of
the
middle
kingdom
we
find
it
also
in
the
temple
of
mentuhetep
iii
at
thebes
some
distance
south
of
dashûr
is
mêdûm
where
the
pyramid
of
sneferu
reigns
in
solitude
and
beyond
this
again
is
lisht
where
in
the
years
mm
gautier
and
jéquier
excavated
the
pyramid
of
usertsen
i
the
most
remarkable
find
was
a
cache
of
the
seated
statues
of
the
king
in
white
limestone
in
absolutely
perfect
condition
they
were
found
lying
on
their
sides
just
as
they
had
been
hidden
six
figures
of
the
king
in
the
form
of
osiris
with
the
face
painted
red
were
also
found
such
figures
seem
to
have
been
regularly
set
up
in
front
of
a
royal
sepulchre
several
were
found
in
front
of
the
funerary
temple
of
iii
thebes
which
we
shall
describe
later
a
fine
altar
of
gray
granite
with
representations
in
relief
of
the
nomes
bringing
offerings
was
also
recovered
the
pyramid
of
lisht
itself
is
not
built
of
bricks
like
those
of
dashûr
but
of
stone
it
was
not
however
erected
in
so
solid
a
fashion
as
those
of
earlier
days
at
gîza
or
abusîr
and
nothing
is
left
of
it
now
but
a
heap
of
débris
the
xiith
dynasty
architects
built
walls
of
magnificent
masonry
as
we
have
seen
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
stone
casing
of
their
pyramids
was
originally
very
fine
but
the
interior
is
of
brick
or
rubble
the
wonderful
system
of
building
employed
by
kings
of
the
ivth
dynasty
at
giza
was
not
practised
south
of
lisht
is
illahun
and
at
the
entrance
to
the
province
of
the
fayyûm
and
west
of
this
nearer
the
fayyûm
is
hawara
where
petrie
excavated
the
pyramids
of
usertsen
senusret
ii
and
iii
his
discoveries
have
already
been
described
by
maspero
in
his
history
so
that
it
will
suffice
here
merely
to
compare
them
with
the
results
of
de
later
work
at
dashûr
and
that
of
mm
gautier
and
jéquier
at
lisht
to
note
recent
conclusions
in
connection
with
them
and
to
describe
the
newest
discoveries
in
the
same
region
both
pyramids
are
of
brick
lined
with
stone
like
those
of
dashûr
with
some
differences
of
internal
construction
since
stone
walls
exist
in
the
interior
the
central
chambers
and
passages
leading
to
them
were
discovered
and
in
both
cases
the
passages
are
peculiarly
complex
with
dumb
chambers
great
stone
portcullises
in
order
to
mislead
and
block
the
way
to
possible
plunderers
the
extraordinary
sepulchral
chamber
of
the
hawara
pyramid
which
though
it
is
over
feet
long
by
ten
feet
wide
over
all
is
hewn
out
of
one
solid
block
of
hard
yellow
quartzite
gives
some
idea
of
the
remarkable
facility
of
dealing
with
huge
stones
and
the
love
of
utilizing
them
which
is
especially
characteristic
of
the
xiith
dynasty
the
pyramid
of
hawara
was
provided
with
a
funerary
temple
the
like
of
which
had
never
been
known
in
egypt
before
and
was
never
known
afterwards
it
was
a
huge
building
far
larger
than
the
pyramid
itself
and
built
of
fine
limestone
and
crystalline
white
quartzite
in
a
style
eminently
characteristic
of
the
xiith
dynasty
in
actual
superficies
this
temple
covered
an
extent
of
ground
within
which
the
temples
of
karnak
luxor
and
the
ramesseum
at
thebes
could
have
stood
but
has
now
almost
entirely
disappeared
having
been
used
as
a
quarry
for
two
thousand
years
in
roman
times
this
destroying
process
had
already
begun
but
even
then
the
building
was
still
magnificent
and
had
been
noted
with
wonder
by
all
the
greek
visitors
to
egypt
from
the
time
of
herodotus
downwards
even
before
his
day
it
had
received
the
name
of
the
on
account
of
its
supposed
resemblance
to
the
original
labyrinth
in
crete
that
the
hawara
temple
was
the
egyptian
labyrinth
was
pointed
out
by
lepsius
in
the
of
the
last
century
within
the
last
two
or
three
years
attention
has
again
been
drawn
to
it
by
arthur
discovery
of
the
cretan
labyrinth
itself
in
the
shape
of
the
minoan
or
early
mycenæan
palace
of
knossos
near
candia
in
crete
it
is
impossible
to
enter
here
into
all
the
arguments
by
which
it
has
been
proved
that
the
knossian
palace
is
the
veritable
labyrinth
of
the
minotaur
legend
nor
would
it
be
strictly
germane
to
our
subject
were
we
to
do
so
but
it
may
suffice
to
say
here
that
the
word
illustration
greek
word
has
been
proved
to
be
of
rather
of
and
would
mean
in
karian
of
the
like
in
karia
where
zeus
was
depicted
with
a
double
axe
labrys
in
his
hand
the
group
of
languages
to
which
certainly
lycian
and
probably
karian
belong
has
been
shown
by
the
german
philologer
kretschmer
to
have
spread
over
greece
into
italy
in
the
period
before
the
aryan
greeks
entered
hellas
and
to
have
left
undoubted
traces
of
its
presence
in
greek
and
in
the
greek
language
itself
before
the
true
hellenes
reached
crete
an
asianic
dialect
must
have
been
spoken
there
and
to
this
language
the
word
must
originally
have
belonged
the
classical
labyrinth
was
the
knossian
the
palace
of
knossos
was
emphatically
the
chief
seat
of
the
worship
of
a
god
whose
emblem
was
the
it
was
the
knossian
of
the
the
cretan
it
used
to
be
supposed
that
the
cretan
labyrinth
had
taken
its
name
from
the
egyptian
one
and
the
word
itself
was
supposed
to
be
of
egyptian
origin
an
egyptian
etymology
was
found
for
it
as
which
might
be
interpreted
with
some
violence
to
egyptian
construction
as
temple
at
the
mouth
of
the
canal
the
bahr
yusuf
which
enters
the
fayyûm
at
hawara
but
unluckily
this
word
would
have
been
pronounced
by
the
natives
of
the
vicinity
as
which
is
not
very
much
like
illustration
greek
word
is
in
fact
a
mere
figment
of
the
philological
imagination
and
can
not
be
proved
ever
to
have
existed
the
element
according
to
the
local
pronunciation
of
the
fayyûm
and
middle
egypt
called
is
genuine
it
is
the
origin
of
the
modern
illahun
which
is
situated
at
the
however
now
that
we
know
that
the
word
labyrinth
can
be
explained
satisfactorily
with
the
help
of
karian
as
evidently
of
greek
origin
and
as
evidently
the
original
name
of
the
knossian
labyrinth
it
is
obvious
that
there
is
no
need
to
seek
a
explanation
of
the
word
in
egypt
and
to
suppose
that
the
greeks
called
the
cretan
labyrinth
after
the
egyptian
one
the
contrary
is
evidently
the
case
greek
visitors
to
egypt
found
a
resemblance
between
the
great
egyptian
building
with
its
numerous
halls
and
corridors
vast
in
extent
and
the
knossian
palace
even
if
very
little
of
the
latter
was
visible
in
the
classical
period
as
seems
possible
yet
the
site
seems
always
to
have
been
kept
holy
and
free
from
later
building
till
roman
times
and
we
know
that
the
tradition
of
the
mazy
halls
and
corridors
of
the
labyrinth
was
always
clear
and
was
evidently
based
on
a
vivid
reminiscence
actually
one
of
the
most
prominent
characteristics
of
the
knossian
palace
is
its
mazy
and
labyrinthine
system
of
passages
and
chambers
the
parallel
between
the
two
buildings
which
originally
caused
the
greek
visitors
to
give
the
of
hawara
the
name
of
has
been
traced
still
further
the
white
limestone
walls
and
the
shining
portals
of
marble
described
by
strabo
as
characteristic
of
the
egyptian
labyrinth
have
been
compared
with
the
shining
white
selenite
or
gypsum
used
at
knossos
and
certain
general
resemblances
between
the
greek
architecture
of
the
minoan
age
and
the
almost
contemporary
egyptian
architecture
of
the
xiith
dynasty
have
been
pointed
out
such
resemblances
may
go
to
swell
the
amount
of
evidence
already
known
which
tells
us
that
there
was
a
close
connection
between
egyptian
and
minoan
art
and
civilization
established
at
least
as
early
as
see
hall
journal
of
hellenic
studies
pt
ii
the
temple
of
the
sphinx
at
gîza
may
also
be
compared
with
those
of
hawara
and
knossos
it
seems
most
probable
that
the
temple
of
the
sphinx
is
a
xiith
dynasty
building
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
within
the
last
few
years
we
have
learned
from
the
excavations
in
crete
a
new
chapter
of
ancient
history
which
it
might
almost
seem
shows
us
greece
and
egypt
in
regular
communication
from
nearly
the
beginnings
of
egyptian
history
as
the
excavations
which
have
told
us
this
were
carried
on
in
crete
not
in
egypt
to
describe
them
does
not
lie
within
the
scope
of
this
book
though
a
short
sketch
of
their
results
so
far
as
they
affect
egyptian
history
in
later
days
is
given
in
chapter
vii
here
it
may
suffice
to
say
that
as
far
as
the
early
period
is
concerned
egypt
and
crete
were
certainly
in
communication
in
the
time
of
the
xiith
dynasty
and
quite
possibly
in
that
of
the
vith
or
still
earlier
we
have
iiid
dynasty
egyptian
vases
from
knossos
which
were
certainly
not
imported
in
later
days
for
no
ancient
nation
had
antiquarian
tastes
till
the
time
of
the
saïtes
in
egypt
and
of
the
romans
still
later
in
fact
this
communication
seems
to
go
so
far
back
in
time
that
we
are
gradually
being
led
to
perceive
the
possibility
that
the
minoan
culture
of
greece
was
in
its
origin
an
offshoot
from
that
of
primeval
egypt
probably
in
early
neolithic
times
that
is
to
say
the
neolithic
greeks
and
neolithic
egyptians
were
both
members
of
the
same
stock
which
quite
possibly
may
have
had
its
origin
in
africa
and
a
portion
of
which
may
have
crossed
the
sea
to
europe
in
very
early
times
taking
with
it
the
seeds
of
culture
which
in
egypt
developed
in
the
egyptian
way
in
greece
in
the
greek
way
actual
communication
and
connection
may
not
have
been
maintained
at
first
and
probably
they
were
not
petrie
thinks
otherwise
and
would
see
in
the
boats
painted
on
the
predynastic
egyptian
vases
see
chapter
i
the
identical
galleys
by
which
in
late
neolithic
times
commerce
between
crete
and
egypt
was
carried
on
across
the
mediterranean
it
is
certain
however
that
these
boats
are
ordinary
little
river
craft
the
usual
nile
and
of
the
time
they
are
depicted
together
with
emblems
of
the
desert
and
cultivated
land
antelopes
hills
and
the
thoroughly
inland
and
upper
egyptian
character
of
the
whole
design
springs
to
the
eye
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
predynastic
boats
were
not
seagoing
galleys
it
was
probably
not
till
the
time
of
the
that
connection
between
the
greek
mediterraneans
and
the
nilotes
was
it
increased
and
in
the
time
of
the
xiith
dynasty
when
the
labyrinth
of
amenemhat
iii
was
built
there
seems
to
have
been
some
kind
of
more
or
less
regular
communication
between
the
two
countries
it
is
certain
that
artistic
ideas
were
exchanged
between
them
at
this
period
how
communication
was
carried
on
we
do
not
know
but
it
was
probably
rather
by
way
of
cyprus
and
the
syrian
coast
than
directly
across
the
open
sea
we
shall
revert
to
this
point
when
we
come
to
describe
the
connection
between
crete
and
egypt
in
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
when
cretan
ambassadors
visited
the
egyptian
court
and
were
depicted
in
tomb
paintings
at
thebes
between
the
time
of
the
xiith
dynasty
and
that
of
the
xviiith
this
connection
seems
to
have
been
very
considerably
strengthened
for
at
knossos
have
been
found
an
egyptian
statuette
of
an
egyptian
named
abnub
who
from
his
name
must
have
lived
about
the
end
of
the
xiiith
dynasty
and
the
top
of
an
alabastron
with
the
royal
name
of
khian
one
of
the
hyksos
kings
quite
close
to
hawara
at
illahun
in
the
ruins
of
the
town
which
was
built
by
workmen
when
they
were
building
his
pyramid
petrie
found
fragments
of
pottery
of
types
which
we
now
know
well
from
excavations
in
crete
and
cyprus
though
they
were
then
unknown
they
are
fragments
of
the
polychrome
cretan
ware
called
after
the
name
of
the
place
where
it
was
first
found
in
crete
kamares
ware
and
of
a
black
ware
ornamented
with
small
punctures
which
are
often
filled
up
with
white
this
latter
ware
has
been
found
elsewhere
associated
with
xiiith
dynasty
antiquities
the
former
is
known
to
belong
in
crete
to
the
period
long
anterior
to
the
or
period
which
was
contemporary
with
the
egyptian
xviiith
dynasty
we
have
here
another
interesting
proof
of
a
connection
between
xiith
dynasty
egypt
and
early
minoan
crete
the
later
connection
under
the
xviiith
and
following
dynasties
is
also
illustrated
in
the
same
reign
by
finds
of
late
mycenaean
objects
and
foreign
graves
at
medinet
gurob
one
man
who
was
buried
here
bore
the
name
of
the
the
tursha
were
a
people
of
the
mediterranean
possibly
tylissians
of
crete
these
excavations
at
hawara
illahun
kahun
and
gurob
were
carried
out
in
the
years
since
then
petrie
and
his
have
revisited
the
same
district
and
gurob
has
been
in
by
loat
and
ayrton
who
discovered
there
a
shrine
devoted
to
the
worship
of
fish
this
work
was
carried
on
at
the
same
time
as
main
excavation
for
the
egypt
exploration
fund
at
annas
or
the
site
of
the
ancient
henensu
the
herakleopolis
of
the
greeks
naville
had
excavated
there
for
the
egypt
exploration
fund
in
but
had
not
completely
cleared
the
temple
this
work
was
now
taken
up
by
petrie
who
laid
the
whole
building
bare
it
is
dedicated
to
hershefi
the
local
deity
of
herakleopolis
this
god
who
was
called
by
the
greeks
and
identified
with
herakles
was
in
fact
a
form
of
horus
with
the
head
of
a
ram
his
name
means
the
greater
part
of
the
temple
dates
to
the
time
of
the
xixth
dynasty
and
nothing
of
the
early
period
is
left
we
know
however
that
the
middle
kingdom
was
the
flourishing
period
of
the
city
of
hershefi
for
a
comparatively
brief
period
between
the
age
of
memphite
hegemony
and
that
of
theban
dominion
herakleopolis
was
the
capital
city
of
egypt
the
kings
of
the
ixth
and
xth
dynasties
were
herakleopolites
though
we
know
little
of
them
one
kheti
is
said
to
have
been
a
great
tyrant
another
nebkaurâ
is
known
only
as
a
figure
in
the
of
the
eloquent
peasant
a
classical
story
much
in
vogue
in
later
days
another
merikarâ
is
a
more
real
personage
for
we
have
contemporary
records
of
his
days
in
the
inscriptions
of
the
tombs
at
asyût
from
which
we
see
that
the
princes
of
thebes
were
already
wearing
down
the
northerners
in
spite
of
the
resistance
of
the
adherents
of
herakleopolis
among
whom
the
most
valiant
were
the
chiefs
of
asyût
the
civil
war
eventuated
in
favour
of
thebes
and
the
theban
xith
dynasty
assumed
the
double
crown
the
sceptre
passed
from
memphis
and
the
north
and
thebes
enters
upon
the
scene
of
egyptian
history
with
this
event
the
also
entered
upon
a
new
era
of
development
the
metropolis
of
the
kingdom
was
once
more
shifted
to
the
south
and
although
the
kings
of
the
xiith
dynasty
actually
resided
in
the
north
their
theban
origin
was
never
forgotten
and
thebes
was
regarded
as
the
chief
city
of
the
country
the
xith
dynasty
kings
actually
reigned
at
thebes
and
there
the
later
kings
of
the
xiiith
dynasty
retired
after
the
conquest
of
the
hyksos
the
fact
that
with
thebes
were
associated
all
the
heroic
traditions
of
the
struggle
against
the
hyksos
ensured
the
final
stability
of
the
capital
there
when
the
hated
semites
were
finally
driven
out
and
the
national
kingdom
was
in
its
full
extent
from
north
to
south
but
for
occasional
intervals
as
when
akhunaten
held
his
court
at
tell
and
ramses
ii
at
tanis
thebes
remained
the
national
capital
for
six
hundred
years
till
the
time
of
the
xxiid
dynasty
another
great
change
which
differentiates
the
middle
kingdom
dynasties
from
the
old
kingdom
was
caused
by
coming
into
contact
with
other
outside
nations
at
this
period
during
the
whole
history
of
the
old
kingdom
egyptian
relations
with
the
outer
world
had
been
nil
we
have
some
inkling
of
occasional
connection
with
the
mediterranean
peoples
the
or
northerners
we
have
accounts
of
wars
with
the
people
of
sinai
and
other
bedawin
and
negroes
and
expeditions
were
also
sent
to
the
land
of
punt
somaliland
by
way
of
the
upper
nile
but
we
have
not
the
slightest
hint
of
any
connection
with
or
even
knowledge
of
the
great
nations
of
the
euphrates
valley
or
the
peoples
of
palestine
the
babylonian
king
invaded
the
sinaitic
peninsula
the
land
of
magan
as
early
as
c
about
the
time
of
the
iiid
egyptian
dynasty
the
great
king
tjeser
of
that
dynasty
also
invaded
sinai
and
so
did
snefru
the
last
king
of
the
dynasty
but
we
have
no
hint
of
any
collision
between
babylonians
and
egyptians
at
that
time
nor
do
either
of
them
betray
the
slightest
knowledge
of
one
existence
it
can
hardly
be
that
the
two
civilized
peoples
of
the
world
in
those
days
were
really
absolutely
ignorant
of
each
other
but
we
have
no
trace
of
any
connection
between
them
other
than
the
possible
one
before
the
founding
of
the
egyptian
monarchy
this
early
connection
however
is
very
problematical
we
have
seen
that
there
seems
to
be
in
early
egyptian
civilization
an
element
ultimately
of
babylonian
origin
and
that
there
are
two
theories
as
to
how
it
reached
egypt
one
supposes
that
it
was
brought
by
a
semitic
people
of
arab
affinities
represented
by
the
modern
grallas
who
crossed
the
straits
of
bab
and
reached
egypt
either
by
way
of
the
wadi
hammamat
or
by
the
upper
nile
the
other
would
bring
it
across
the
isthmus
of
suez
to
the
delta
where
at
heliopolis
there
certainly
seems
to
have
been
a
settlement
of
a
semitic
type
of
very
ancient
culture
in
both
cases
we
should
have
semites
bringing
babylonian
culture
to
egypt
this
as
we
may
remind
the
reader
was
not
itself
of
semitic
origin
but
was
a
development
due
to
a
people
the
sumerians
as
they
are
called
who
so
far
as
we
know
were
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
babylonia
the
sumerian
language
was
of
agglutinative
type
radically
distinct
both
from
the
pure
semitic
idioms
and
from
egyptian
the
babylonian
elements
of
culture
which
the
early
semitic
invaders
brought
with
them
to
egypt
were
then
ultimately
of
sumerian
origin
sumerian
civilization
had
profoundly
influenced
the
semitic
tribes
for
centuries
before
the
semitic
conquest
of
babylonia
and
when
the
sumerians
became
more
and
more
a
conquered
race
finally
amalgamating
with
their
conquerors
and
losing
their
racial
and
linguistic
individuality
they
were
conquered
by
an
alien
race
but
not
by
an
alien
culture
for
the
culture
of
the
semites
was
sumerian
the
semitic
races
owing
their
civilization
to
the
sumerians
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
a
great
deal
of
what
we
call
semitic
culture
is
fundamentally
in
the
earliest
days
then
egypt
received
elements
of
sumerian
culture
through
a
semitic
medium
which
introduced
semitic
elements
into
the
language
of
the
people
and
a
semitic
racial
strain
it
is
possible
that
both
theories
as
to
the
routes
of
these
primeval
conquerors
are
true
and
that
two
waves
of
semites
entered
the
nile
valley
towards
the
close
of
the
neolithic
period
one
by
way
of
the
upper
nile
or
wadi
hammamat
the
other
by
way
of
heliopolis
after
the
reconsolidation
of
the
egyptian
people
with
perhaps
an
autocratic
class
of
semitic
origin
and
a
populace
of
indigenous
nilotic
race
we
have
no
trace
of
further
connection
with
the
centre
of
semitic
culture
in
babylonia
till
the
time
of
the
theban
hegemony
under
the
xiith
dynasty
we
see
egyptians
in
friendly
relations
with
the
bedawin
of
idumsea
and
southern
palestine
thus
sanehat
the
younger
son
of
amenemhat
i
when
the
death
of
his
royal
father
was
announced
fled
from
the
new
king
usertsen
senusret
into
palestine
and
there
married
the
daughter
of
the
chief
ammuanshi
and
became
a
syrian
chief
himself
only
finally
returning
to
egypt
as
an
old
man
on
the
assurance
of
the
royal
pardon
and
favour
we
have
in
the
reign
of
usertsen
senusret
ii
the
famous
visit
of
the
arab
chief
abisha
with
his
following
to
the
court
of
khnumhetep
the
prince
of
the
oryx
nome
in
middle
egypt
as
we
see
it
depicted
on
the
walls
of
tomb
at
beni
hasan
we
see
usertsen
senusret
iii
invading
palestine
to
chastise
the
land
of
sekmem
and
the
vile
syrians
we
know
of
this
campaign
from
the
interesting
historical
stele
of
the
general
who
took
part
in
it
which
was
found
during
excavations
at
abydos
not
previously
referred
to
above
they
were
carried
out
in
and
resulted
in
the
complete
clearance
of
a
part
of
the
great
cemetery
which
had
been
created
during
the
xiith
dynasty
the
group
of
objects
from
the
tombs
of
this
cemetery
and
those
of
xviiith
dynasty
tombs
also
found
is
especially
valuable
as
showing
the
styles
of
objects
in
use
at
these
two
periods
see
garstang
the
arm
of
egypt
was
growing
longer
and
its
weight
was
being
felt
in
regions
where
it
had
previously
been
entirely
unknown
eventually
the
collision
came
egypt
collided
with
an
asiatic
power
and
got
the
worst
of
the
encounter
so
much
the
worse
that
the
theban
monarchy
of
the
middle
kingdom
was
overthrown
and
northern
egypt
was
actually
conquered
by
the
asiatic
foreigners
and
ruled
by
a
foreign
house
for
several
centuries
who
these
conquering
hyksos
or
shepherd
kings
were
no
recent
discovery
has
told
us
an
old
idea
was
that
they
were
mongols
it
was
supposed
that
the
remarkable
faces
of
the
sphinxes
of
tanis
now
in
the
cairo
museum
which
bore
the
names
of
hyksos
kings
were
of
mongolian
type
as
also
those
of
two
colossal
royal
heads
discovered
by
naville
at
bubastis
but
golénischeff
has
now
shown
that
these
heads
are
really
those
of
xiith
dynasty
kings
and
not
of
hyksos
at
all
newberry
and
garstang
have
lately
endeavoured
to
show
that
this
type
was
foreign
and
probably
connected
with
that
of
the
kheta
or
hittites
of
northern
syria
who
came
into
prominence
as
enemies
of
egypt
at
a
later
period
they
think
that
the
type
was
introduced
into
the
egyptian
royal
family
by
nefret
the
queen
of
usertsen
senusret
ii
whom
they
suppose
to
have
been
a
hittite
princess
at
the
same
time
they
think
it
probable
that
the
type
was
also
that
of
the
hyksos
whom
they
consider
to
have
been
practically
hittites
they
therefore
revive
the
theory
of
de
cara
which
connects
the
hyksos
with
the
hittites
and
these
with
the
pelasgi
and
tyrseni
this
is
a
very
interesting
theory
which
when
carried
out
to
its
logical
conclusion
would
connect
the
hyksos
and
hittites
racially
with
the
mycenseans
of
greece
as
well
as
with
the
etruscans
of
italy
but
there
is
little
of
certainty
in
it
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
that
we
may
eventually
come
to
know
that
the
hittites
the
of
the
assyrians
and
other
tribes
of
asia
minor
were
racially
akin
to
the
of
greece
but
the
connection
between
the
hyksos
and
the
hittites
is
to
seek
the
countenances
of
the
kheta
on
the
egyptian
monuments
of
ramses
time
have
an
angular
cast
and
so
have
those
of
the
tanis
sphinxes
of
queen
nefret
of
the
bubastis
statues
and
the
statues
of
usertsen
senusret
iii
and
amenemhat
iii
we
might
then
suppose
with
newberry
and
garstang
that
nefret
was
a
kheta
princess
who
gave
her
peculiar
racial
traits
to
her
son
usertsen
senusret
iii
and
his
son
were
it
not
far
more
probable
that
the
resemblance
between
this
peculiar
xiith
dynasty
type
and
the
kheta
face
is
purely
fortuitous
there
is
really
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
type
of
face
presented
by
nefret
usertsen
and
amenemhat
is
not
purely
egyptian
it
may
be
seen
in
many
a
modern
fellah
and
the
truth
probably
is
that
the
sculptors
have
in
the
case
of
these
rulers
very
faithfully
and
carefully
depicted
their
portraits
and
that
their
faces
happen
to
have
been
of
a
rather
hard
and
forbidding
type
but
if
we
grant
the
contention
of
newberry
and
garstang
for
the
moment
where
is
the
connection
between
these
xiith
dynasty
kings
and
the
hyksos
all
the
tanite
monuments
with
this
peculiar
facial
type
which
would
be
considered
hyksos
are
certainly
of
the
xiith
dynasty
the
only
statue
of
a
hyksos
king
which
was
undoubtedly
originally
made
for
him
and
is
not
one
of
the
xiith
dynasty
usurped
is
the
small
one
of
khian
at
cairo
discovered
by
naville
at
bubastis
and
this
has
no
head
so
that
we
have
not
the
slightest
idea
of
what
a
hyksos
looked
like
moreover
the
evidence
of
the
hyksos
names
which
are
known
to
us
points
in
quite
a
different
direction
the
kheta
or
hittites
were
certainly
not
semites
yet
the
hyksos
names
are
definitely
semitic
in
fact
it
is
most
probable
that
the
hyksos
or
shepherd
kings
were
as
the
classical
authorities
say
they
were
and
as
their
name
or
of
the
or
of
the
also
testifies
purely
and
simply
arabs
now
it
is
not
a
little
curious
that
almost
at
the
same
time
that
a
nomad
arab
race
conquered
lower
egypt
and
settled
in
it
as
rulers
just
as
and
the
followers
of
islam
did
over
two
thousand
years
later
another
arab
race
may
have
imposed
its
rule
upon
babylonia
yet
this
may
have
been
the
case
for
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
to
which
the
famous
hammurabi
belonged
was
very
probably
of
arab
origin
to
judge
by
the
forms
of
some
of
the
royal
names
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
that
there
was
some
connection
between
these
two
conquests
and
that
both
babylonia
and
egypt
fell
in
the
period
before
the
year
before
some
great
migratory
movement
from
arabia
which
overran
babylonia
palestine
and
even
the
egyptian
delta
in
this
manner
egypt
and
babylonia
may
have
been
brought
together
in
common
subjection
to
the
arab
we
do
not
know
whether
any
regular
communication
between
egypt
under
semitic
rule
and
babylonia
was
now
established
but
we
do
know
that
during
the
hyksos
period
there
were
considerable
relations
between
egypt
and
crete
and
relations
with
mesopotamia
may
possibly
have
been
established
at
any
rate
when
the
war
of
liberation
which
was
directed
by
the
princes
of
thebes
was
finally
brought
to
a
successful
conclusion
and
the
arabs
were
expelled
we
find
the
egyptians
a
much
changed
nation
they
had
adopted
for
war
the
use
of
horse
and
chariot
which
they
learnt
from
their
semitic
conquerors
whose
victory
was
in
all
probability
largely
gained
by
their
use
and
generally
speaking
they
had
become
much
more
like
the
western
asiatic
nations
egypt
was
no
longer
isolated
for
she
had
been
forcibly
brought
into
contact
with
the
foreign
world
and
had
learned
much
she
was
no
longer
within
her
own
borders
if
the
semites
could
conquer
her
so
could
she
conquer
the
semites
armed
with
horse
and
chariot
the
egyptians
went
forth
to
battle
and
their
revenge
was
complete
all
palestine
and
syria
were
egyptian
domains
for
five
hundred
years
after
the
conquest
by
thothmes
i
and
iii
and
ashur
and
babel
sent
tribute
to
the
pharaoh
of
egypt
the
reaction
came
and
egypt
was
thrown
prostrate
beneath
the
feet
of
assyria
but
her
claim
to
dominion
over
the
western
asiatics
was
never
abandoned
and
was
revived
in
all
its
pomp
by
ptolemy
euergetes
who
brought
back
in
triumph
to
egypt
the
images
of
the
gods
which
had
been
removed
by
assyrians
and
babylonians
centuries
before
this
claim
was
never
allowed
by
the
asiatics
it
is
true
and
their
kings
wrote
to
the
proudest
pharaoh
as
to
an
absolute
equal
even
the
king
of
cyprus
calls
the
king
of
egypt
his
brother
but
palestine
was
admitted
to
be
an
egyptian
possession
and
the
phoenicians
were
always
energetic
supporters
of
the
egyptian
régime
against
the
lawless
bedawîn
tribes
who
were
constantly
intriguing
with
the
kheta
or
hittite
power
to
the
north
against
egypt
the
existence
of
this
imperial
possession
meant
that
the
eyes
of
the
egyptians
were
now
permanently
turned
in
the
direction
of
western
asia
with
which
they
were
henceforth
in
constant
and
intimate
communication
the
first
theban
period
and
the
hyksos
invasion
therefore
mark
a
in
egyptian
history
at
which
we
may
fitly
leave
it
for
a
time
in
order
to
turn
our
attention
to
those
peoples
of
western
asia
with
whom
the
egyptians
had
now
come
into
permanent
contact
just
as
new
discoveries
have
been
made
in
egypt
which
have
modified
our
previous
conception
of
her
history
so
also
have
the
excavators
of
the
ancient
sites
in
the
mesopotamian
valley
made
during
the
last
few
years
discoveries
which
have
enabled
us
to
add
to
and
revise
much
of
our
knowledge
of
the
history
of
babylonia
and
assyria
in
palestine
and
the
sinaitic
peninsula
also
the
spade
has
been
used
with
effect
but
a
detailed
account
of
work
in
sinai
and
palestine
falls
within
the
limits
of
a
description
of
biblical
discoveries
rather
than
of
this
book
the
following
chapters
will
therefore
deal
chiefly
with
modern
discoveries
which
have
told
us
new
facts
with
regard
to
the
history
of
the
ancient
sumerians
themselves
and
of
the
babylonians
elamites
kassites
and
assyrians
the
inheritors
of
the
ancient
sumerian
civilization
which
was
older
than
that
of
egypt
and
which
as
we
have
seen
probably
contributed
somewhat
to
its
formation
these
were
the
two
primal
civilizations
of
the
ancient
world
for
two
thousand
years
each
marched
upon
a
solitary
road
without
meeting
the
other
eventually
the
two
roads
converged
we
have
hitherto
dealt
with
the
road
of
the
egyptians
we
now
describe
that
of
the
mesopotamians
up
to
the
point
of
convergence
chapter
iv
recent
excavations
in
western
asia
and
the
dawn
of
chaldæan
history
in
the
preceding
pages
it
has
been
shown
how
recent
excavations
in
egypt
have
revealed
an
entirely
new
chapter
in
the
history
of
that
country
and
how
in
consequence
our
theories
with
regard
to
the
origin
of
egyptian
civilization
have
been
entirely
remodelled
excavations
have
been
and
are
being
carried
out
in
mesopotamia
and
the
adjacent
countries
with
no
less
enthusiasm
and
energy
than
in
egypt
itself
and
although
it
can
not
be
said
that
they
have
resulted
in
any
sweeping
modification
of
our
conceptions
with
regard
to
the
origin
and
kinship
of
the
early
races
of
western
asia
yet
they
have
lately
added
considerably
to
our
knowledge
of
the
ancient
history
of
the
countries
in
that
region
of
the
world
this
is
particularly
the
case
in
respect
of
the
sumerians
who
so
far
as
we
know
at
present
were
the
earliest
inhabitants
of
the
fertile
plains
of
mesopotamia
the
beginnings
of
this
ancient
people
stretch
back
into
the
remote
past
and
their
origin
is
still
shrouded
in
the
mists
of
antiquity
when
first
we
come
across
them
they
have
already
attained
a
high
level
of
civilization
they
have
built
temples
and
palaces
and
houses
of
burnt
and
unburnt
brick
and
they
have
reduced
their
system
of
agriculture
to
a
science
intersecting
their
country
with
canals
for
purposes
of
irrigation
and
to
ensure
a
good
supply
of
water
to
their
cities
their
sculpture
and
pottery
furnish
abundant
evidence
that
they
have
already
attained
a
comparatively
high
level
in
the
practice
of
the
arts
and
finally
they
have
evolved
a
complicated
system
of
writing
which
originally
had
its
origin
in
but
afterwards
had
been
developed
along
phonetic
lines
to
have
attained
to
this
pitch
of
culture
argues
long
periods
of
previous
development
and
we
must
conclude
that
they
had
been
settled
in
southern
babylonia
many
centuries
before
the
period
to
which
we
must
assign
the
earliest
of
their
remains
at
present
discovered
that
this
people
were
not
indigenous
to
babylonia
is
highly
probable
but
we
have
little
data
by
which
to
determine
the
region
from
which
they
originally
came
prom
the
fact
that
they
built
their
ziggurats
or
temple
towers
of
huge
masses
of
unburnt
brick
which
rose
high
above
the
surrounding
plain
and
that
their
ideal
was
to
make
each
a
mountain
it
has
been
argued
that
they
were
a
mountain
race
and
the
home
from
which
they
sprang
has
been
sought
in
central
asia
other
scholars
have
detected
signs
of
their
origin
in
their
language
and
system
of
writing
and
from
the
fact
that
they
spoke
an
agglutinative
tongue
and
at
the
earliest
period
arranged
the
characters
of
their
script
in
vertical
lines
like
the
chinese
it
has
been
urged
that
they
were
of
mongol
extraction
though
a
case
may
be
made
out
for
this
hypothesis
it
would
be
rash
to
dogmatize
for
or
against
it
and
it
is
wiser
to
await
the
discovery
of
further
material
on
which
a
more
certain
decision
may
be
based
but
whatever
their
origin
it
is
certain
that
the
sumerians
exercised
an
extraordinary
influence
on
all
races
with
which
either
directly
or
indirectly
they
came
in
contact
the
ancient
inhabitants
of
elam
at
a
very
early
period
adopted
in
principle
their
method
of
writing
and
afterwards
living
in
isolation
in
the
mountainous
districts
of
persia
developed
it
on
lines
of
their
own
see
chap
v
and
note
on
their
invasion
of
babylonia
the
semites
fell
absolutely
under
sumerian
influence
and
although
they
eventually
conquered
and
absorbed
the
sumerians
their
civilization
remained
sumerian
to
the
core
moreover
by
means
of
the
semitic
inhabitants
of
babylonia
sumerian
culture
continued
to
exert
its
influence
on
other
and
more
distant
races
we
have
already
seen
how
a
babylonian
element
probably
enters
into
egyptian
civilization
through
semitic
infiltration
across
the
straits
of
bab
or
by
way
of
the
isthmus
of
suez
and
it
was
sumerian
culture
which
these
semites
brought
with
them
in
like
manner
through
the
semitic
babylonians
the
assyrians
the
kassites
and
the
inhabitants
of
palestine
and
syria
and
of
some
parts
of
asia
minor
armenia
and
kurdistan
all
in
turn
experienced
indirectly
the
influence
of
sumerian
civilization
and
continued
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
to
reproduce
elements
of
this
early
culture
it
will
be
seen
that
the
influence
of
the
sumerians
furnishes
us
with
a
key
to
much
that
would
otherwise
prove
puzzling
in
the
history
of
the
early
races
of
western
asia
it
is
therefore
all
the
more
striking
to
recall
the
fact
that
but
a
few
years
ago
the
very
existence
of
this
ancient
people
was
called
in
question
at
that
time
the
excavations
in
mesopotamia
had
not
revealed
many
traces
of
the
race
itself
and
its
previous
existence
had
been
mainly
inferred
from
a
number
of
sumerian
compositions
inscribed
upon
assyrian
tablets
found
in
the
library
of
at
nineveh
these
compositions
were
furnished
with
assyrian
translations
upon
the
tablets
on
which
they
were
inscribed
and
it
was
correctly
argued
by
the
late
sir
henry
rawlinson
the
late
oppert
schrader
sayce
and
other
scholars
that
they
were
written
in
the
language
of
the
earlier
inhabitants
of
the
country
whom
the
semitic
babylonians
had
displaced
but
halévy
started
a
theory
to
the
effect
that
sumerian
was
not
a
language
at
all
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
term
but
was
a
cabalistic
method
of
writing
invented
by
the
semitic
babylonian
priests

of

photograph
by
mansell
co
the
argument
on
which
the
upholders
of
this
theory
mainly
relied
was
that
many
of
the
phonetic
values
of
the
sumerian
signs
were
obviously
derived
from
semitic
equivalents
and
they
hastily
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
whole
language
was
similarly
derived
from
semitic
babylonian
and
was
in
fact
a
purely
arbitrary
invention
of
the
babylonian
priests
this
theory
ignored
all
questions
of
inherent
probability
and
did
not
attempt
to
explain
why
the
babylonian
priests
should
have
troubled
themselves
to
make
such
an
invention
and
afterwards
have
stultified
themselves
by
carefully
appending
assyrian
translations
to
the
majority
of
the
sumerian
compositions
which
they
copied
out
moreover
the
nature
of
these
compositions
is
not
such
as
we
should
expect
to
find
recorded
in
a
cabalistic
method
of
writing
they
contain
no
secret
lore
of
the
babylonian
priests
but
are
merely
hymns
and
prayers
and
religious
compositions
similar
to
those
employed
by
the
babylonians
and
assyrians
themselves
but
in
spite
of
its
inherent
improbabilities
halévy
succeeded
in
making
many
converts
to
his
theory
including
friedrich
delitzsch
and
a
number
of
the
younger
school
of
german
assyriologists
more
conservative
scholars
such
as
sir
henry
rawlinson
oppert
and
schrader
stoutly
opposed
the
theory
maintaining
that
sumerian
was
a
real
language
and
had
been
spoken
by
an
earlier
race
whom
the
semitic
babylonians
had
conquered
and
they
explained
the
resemblance
of
some
of
the
sumerian
values
to
semitic
roots
by
supposing
that
sumerian
had
not
been
suddenly
superseded
by
the
language
of
the
semitic
invaders
of
babylonia
but
that
the
two
tongues
had
been
spoken
for
long
periods
side
by
side
and
that
each
had
been
strongly
influenced
by
the
other
this
very
probable
and
sane
explanation
has
been
fully
corroborated
by
subsequent
excavations
particularly
those
that
were
carried
out
at
telloh
in
southern
babylonia
by
the
late
de
sarzec
in
these
mounds
which
mark
the
site
of
the
ancient
sumerian
city
of
shirpurla
were
found
thousands
of
clay
tablets
inscribed
in
archaic
characters
and
in
the
sumerian
language
proving
that
it
had
actually
been
the
language
of
the
early
inhabitants
of
babylonia
while
the
examples
of
their
art
and
the
representations
of
their
form
and
features
which
were
also
afforded
by
the
diggings
at
telloh
proved
once
for
all
that
the
sumerians
were
a
race
of
strongly
marked
characteristics
and
could
not
be
ascribed
to
a
semitic
stock
the
system
of
writing
invented
by
the
ancient
sumerians
was
adopted
by
the
semitic
babylonians
who
modified
it
to
suit
their
own
language
moreover
the
archaic
forms
of
the
characters
many
of
which
under
the
sumerians
still
retained
resemblances
to
the
pictures
of
objects
from
which
they
were
descended
were
considerably
changed
the
lines
of
which
they
were
originally
composed
gave
way
to
wedges
and
the
number
of
the
wedges
of
which
each
sign
consisted
was
gradually
diminished
so
that
in
the
time
of
the
assyrians
and
the
later
babylonians
many
of
the
characters
bore
small
resemblance
to
the
ancient
sumerian
forms
from
which
they
had
been
derived
the
reading
of
sumerian
and
early
babylonian
inscriptions
by
the
late
assyrian
scribes
was
therefore
an
accomplishment
only
to
be
acquired
as
the
result
of
long
study
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
as
an
assistance
to
the
reading
of
these
early
texts
the
scribes
compiled
lists
of
archaic
signs
sometimes
opposite
each
archaic
character
they
drew
a
picture
of
the
object
from
which
they
imagined
it
was
derived
this
fact
is
significant
as
proving
that
the
assyrian
scribes
recognized
the
pictorial
origin
of
cuneiform
writing
but
the
pictures
they
drew
opposite
the
signs
are
rather
fanciful
and
it
can
not
be
said
that
their
guesses
were
very
successful
that
we
are
able
to
criticize
the
theories
of
the
assyrians
as
to
the
origin
and
forms
of
the
early
characters
is
in
the
main
due
to
de
labours
from
whose
excavations
many
thousands
of
inscriptions
of
the
sumerians
have
been
recovered
the
main
results
of
de
diggings
at
telloh
have
already
been
described
by
maspero
in
his
history
and
therefore
we
need
not
go
over
them
again
but
will
here
confine
ourselves
to
the
results
which
have
been
obtained
from
recent
excavations
at
telloh
and
at
other
sites
in
western
asia
with
the
death
of
de
sarzec
which
occurred
in
his
year
on
may
the
wonderfully
successful
series
of
excavations
which
he
had
carried
out
at
telloh
was
brought
to
an
end
in
consequence
it
was
feared
at
the
time
that
the
french
diggings
on
this
site
might
be
interrupted
for
a
considerable
period
such
an
event
would
have
been
regretted
by
all
those
who
are
interested
in
the
early
history
of
the
east
for
in
spite
of
the
treasures
found
by
de
sarzec
in
the
course
of
his
various
campaigns
it
was
obvious
that
the
site
was
far
from
being
exhausted
and
that
the
tells
as
yet
unexplored
contained
inscriptions
and
antiquities
extending
back
to
the
very
earliest
periods
of
sumerian
history

to

more
easily
protected
against

by
night
but
the
fact
that
it
was
an
ride
from
the

caused
an
unnecessary
loss
of
time
and
rendered
the
strict
supervision
of
the
diggers
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
during
the
first
work
rough
huts
of
reeds
surrounded
by
a
wall
of

and
a

served
the
new
expedition
for
its

among

last
year
these
makeshift
arrangements
were
superseded
by
a
regular
house
built
out
of
the
burnt

are

in
abundance

the
excellent
relations
which
capt

has
established
with
the
karagul
arabs
who
occupy

have
proved
to
be
the
best
kind
of
protection
for

in
scientific
work
upon

marked
out

four
large

running
roughly
north
and

descending
steeply
on
the
east

with
their

rising
by

and
the
other
principal
buildings
of
the
city
an
indication
of
the
richness
of
the
site
in
antiquities
was
afforded
to
the
new
mission
before
it
had
started
regular
excavation
and
while
it
was
yet
engaged
in
levelling
its
encampment
and
surrounding
it
with
a
wall
and
ditch
the
spot
selected
for
the
camp
was
a
small
mound
to
the
south
of
the
site
of
telloh
and
here
in
the
course
of
preparing
the
site
for
the
encampment
and
digging
the
ditch
objects
were
found
at
a
depth
of
less
than
a
foot
beneath
the
surface
of
the

these
included
daggers
copper

and
came
upon
the
remains
of

and
recovered
numerous
objects
dating
principally
from
the
period
of

the

which

will
refer
again

already
discovered
numbers
of
monuments
dating
from
the
earlier
periods
of

history
before
the
conquest
and
consolidation
of
babylonia
under
sargon
of

and
had
excavated
a
primitive
terrace
built
by
the
early
king
both
on
and
around
this
large
mound
capt
cros
cut
an
extensive
series
of
trenches
and
in
digging
to
the
north
of
the
mound
he
found
a
number
of
objects
including
an
alabaster
tablet
of
which
had
been
blackened
by
fire
at
the
foot
of
the
tell
he
found
a
copper
helmet
like
those
represented
on
the
famous
stele
of
vultures
discovered
by

and
among
the
tablets
here
recovered
was
one
with
an
inscription
of
the
time
of

which
records
the
complete
destruction
of
the
city
of

during
his
reign
and
will
be
described
in
greater
detail
later
on
in
this
chapter
on
the
mound
itself
a
considerable
area
was
uncovered
with
remains
of
buildings
still
in

the
use
of
which
appears
to
have
been
of
an
industrial
character
they
included
flights
of
steps
canals
with
raised
banks
and
basins
for
storing
water
not
far
off
are
the
previously
discovered
wells
of

so
that
it
is
legitimate
to
suppose
that

has
here
come
upon

which
were
erected
at

it

have
been

at

engaged
in
excavations
of
a
most
important
character
which
are
being
conducted

regular
and
scientific
manner

the

have
yielded
and

yielding
material
of
the
greatest

and
value
for
the
reconstruction
of
the
early

of

after
briefly
describing
the
character
and
results
of
other
recent
excavations
in
mesopotamia
and
the
neighbouring
lands
we
will
return
to
the
discoveries
at
telloh
and
sketch
the
new
information
they
supply
on
the
history
of
the
earliest
inhabitants
of
the
country
another
french
mission
that
is
carrying
out
work
of
the
very
greatest
interest
to
the
student
of
early
babylonian
history
is
that
which
is
excavating
at
susa
in
persia
under
the
direction
of
de
morgan
whose
work
on
the
prehistoric
and
early
dynastic
sites
in
egypt
has
already
been
described
de
first
digging
at
susa
was
carried
out
in
the
years
and
the
success
with
which
he
met
from
the
very
first
when
cutting
trenches
in
the
mound
which
marks
the
acropolis
of
the
ancient
city
has
led
him
to
concentrate
his
main
efforts
in
this
part
of
the
ruins
ever
since
provisional
trenches
cut
in
the
part
of
the
ruins
called
royal
city
and
in
others
of
the
mounds
at
susa
indicate
that
many
remains
may
eventually
be
found
there
dating
from
the
period
of
the
achæmenian
kings
of
persia
but
it
is
in
the
mound
of
the
acropolis
at
susa
that
de
morgan
has
found
monuments
of
the
greatest
historical
interest
and
value
not
only
in
the
history
of
ancient
elam
but
also
in
that
of
the
earliest
rulers
of
chaldæa
in
the
diggings
carried
out
during
the
first
work
on
the
site
an
obelisk
was
found
inscribed
on
four
sides
with
a
long
text
of
some
columns
written
in
semitic
babylonian
by
the
orders
of
manishtusu
a
very
early
semitic
king
of
the
city
of
kish
in
babylonia
see
illustration
the
text
records
the
purchase
by
the
king
of
kish
of
immense
tracts
of
land
situated
at
kish
and
in
its
neighbourhood
and
its
length
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
it
enumerates
full
details
of
the
size
and
position
of
each
estate
and
the
numbers
and
some
of
the
names
of
the
dwellers
on
the
estates
who
were
engaged
in
their
cultivation
after
details
have
been
given
of
a
number
of
estates
situated
in
the
same
neighbourhood
a
summary
is
appended
referring
to
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
the
fact
is
recorded
that
the
district
dealt
with
in
the
preceding
catalogue
and
summary
had
been
duly
acquired
by
purchase
by
manishtusu
king
of
kish
the
long
text
upon
the
obelisk
is
entirely
taken
up
with
details
of
the
purchase
of
the
territory
and
therefore
its
subject
has
not
any
great
historical
value
mention
is
made
in
it
of
two
personages
one
of
whom
may
possibly
be
identified
with
a
babylonian
ruler
whose
name
is
known
from
other
sources
if
the
proposed
identification
t
should
prove
to
be
correct
it
would
enable
us
to
assign
a
more
precise
date
to
manishtusu
than
has
hitherto
been
possible
one
of
the
personages
in
question
was
a
certain
urukagina
the
son
of
engilsa
patesi
of
shirpurla
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
he
is
the
same
urukagina
who
is
known
to
have
occupied
the
throne
of
shirpurla
though
this
identification
would
bring
manishtusu
down
somewhat
later
than
is
probable
from
the
general
character
of
his
inscriptions
the
other
personage
mentioned
in
the
text
is
the
son
of
manishtusu
named
mesalim
and
there
is
more
to
be
said
for
the
identification
of
this
prince
with
mesilim
the
early
king
of
kish
who
reigned
at
a
period
anterior
to
that
of
eannadu
patesi
of
shirpurla
the
mere
fact
of
so
large
and
important
an
obelisk
inscribed
with
a
semitic
text
by
an
early
babylonian
king
being
found
at
susa
was
an
indication
that
other
monuments
of
even
greater
interest
might
be
forthcoming
from
the
same
spot
and
this
impression
was
intensified
when
a
stele
of
victory
was
found
bearing
an
inscription
of
the
early
semitic
king
of
agade
who
reigned
about
one
face
of
this
stele
is
sculptured
with
a
representation
of
the
king
conquering
his
enemies
in
a
mountainous
country
see

the
king
himself
wears
a
helmet
adorned
with
the
horns
of
a
bull
and
he
carries
his
and
his
bow
and
an
arrow
he
is
nearly
at
the
summit
of
a
high
mountain
and
up
its
steep
sides
along
paths
through
the
trees
which
clothe
the
mountain
climb
his
allies
and
warriors
bearing
standards
and
weapons
the
enemies
are
represented
suing
for
mercy
as
they
turn
to
fly
before
him
one
grasps
a
broken
spear
while
another
crouching
before
the
king
has
been
smitten
in
the
throat
by
an
arrow
from
the
bow
on
the
plain
surface
of
the
stele
above
the
head
may
be
seen
traces
of
an
inscription
of
engraved
in
three
columns
in
the
archaic
characters
of
his
period
from
the
few
signs
of
the
text
that
remain
we
gather
that
had
conducted
a
campaign
with
the
assistance
of
certain
allied
princes
including
the
princes
of
sidur
saluni
and
lulubi
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
they
are
to
be
identified
with
the
warriors
represented
on
the
stele
as
climbing
the
mountain
behind
in
reference
to
this
most
interesting
stele
of
we
may
here
mention
another
inscription
of
this
king
found
quite
recently
at
susa
and
published
only
this
year
which
throws
additional
light
on
allies
and
on
the
empire
which
he
and
his
father
sargon
founded
the
new
inscription
was
engraved
on
the
base
of
a
diorite
statue
which
had
been
broken
to
pieces
so
that
only
the
base
with
a
portion
of
the
text
remained
from
this
inscription
we
learn
that
was
the
head
of
a
confederation
of
nine
chief
allies
or
vassal
princes
and
waged
war
on
his
enemies
with
their
assistance
among
these
nine
allies
of
course
the
princes
of
sidur
saluni
and
lulubi
are
to
be
included
the
new
text
further
records
that
made
an
expedition
against
magan
the
sinaitic
peninsula
and
defeated
manium
the
lord
of
that
region
and
that
he
cut
blocks
of
stone
in
the
mountains
there
and
transported
them
to
his
city
of
agade
where
from
one
of
them
he
made
the
statue
on
the
base
of
which
the
text
was
inscribed
it
was
already
known
from
the
of
sargon
and
a
text
inscribed
on
a
clay
tablet
from
library
at
nineveh
which
associates
the
deeds
of
these
two
early
rulers
with
certain
augural
phenomena
that
had
made
an
expedition
to
sinai
in
the
course
of
his
reign
and
had
conquered
the
king
of
the
country
the
new
text
gives
contemporary
confirmation
of
this
assertion
and
furnishes
us
with
additional
information
with
regard
to
the
name
of
the
conquered
ruler
of
sinai
and
other
details
of
the
campaign
that
monuments
of
such
great
interest
to
the
early
history
of
chaldæa
should
have
been
found
at
susa
in
persia
was
sufficiently
startling
but
an
easy
explanation
was
at
first
forthcoming
from
the
fact
that
stele
of
victory
had
been
used
by
the
later
elamite
king
for
an
inscription
of
his
own
this
he
had
engraved
in
seven
long
lines
along
the
great
cone
in
front
of
which
is
probably
intended
to
represent
the
peak
of
the
mountain
from
the
fact
that
it
had
been
used
in
this
way
by
it
seemed
permissible
to
infer
that
it
had
been
captured
in
the
course
of
a
campaign
and
brought
to
susa
as
a
trophy
of
war
but
we
shall
see
later
on
that
the
existence
of
early
babylonian
inscriptions
and
monuments
in
the
mound
of
the
acropolis
at
susa
is
not
to
be
explained
in
this
way
but
was
due
to
the
wide
extension
of
both
sumerian
and
semitic
influence
throughout
western
asia
from
the
very
earliest
periods
this
subject
will
be
treated
more
fully
in

with
the
early

the
reason
of
this
mixture
of

is
that
the
later

on

the

the
use
of
bricks

been

be
mixed
indiscriminately
with

another
in

as
the

cut
deeper
into

showed

also

plan
of
which
was
in
a
comparatively
good
state
of
preservation
was
a
small
temple
of
the
god
and
this
owed
its
preservation
to
the
fact
that
it
was
not
built
of
unburnt
brick
but
was
largely
composed
of
burnt
brick
and
plaques
and
tiles
of
enamelled
but
although
the
diggings
of
de
morgan
at
susa
have
so
far
afforded
little
information
on
the
subject
of
elamite
architecture
the
separate
objects
found
have
enabled
us
to
gain
considerable
knowledge
of
the
artistic
achievements
of
the
race
during
the
different
periods
of
its
existence
moreover
the
stelæ
and
stone
records
that
have
been
recovered
present
a
wealth
of
material
for
the
study
of
the
long
history
of

and
of
the
kings
who
ruled
in
babylonia

the
most
famous
of
de
recent
finds
is
the
long
code
of
laws
drawn
up
by
hammurabi
the
greatest
king
of
the
first

this
was
engraved
upon

block
of
black
diorite
and
was
found
in
the
tell
of
the
acropolis
in
the
winter
of
this
document
in
itself
has
entirely
revolutionized
current
theories
as
to
the
growth
and
origin
of
the
principal
ancient
legal
codes
it
proves
that
babylonia
was
the
fountainhead
from
which
many
later
races
borrowed
portions
of
their
legislative
systems
moreover
the
subjects
dealt
with
in
this
code
of
laws
embrace
most
of
the
different
classes
of
the
babylonian
people
and
it
regulates
their
duties
and
their
relations
to
one
another
in
their
ordinary
occupations
and
pursuits
it
therefore
throws
much
light
upon
early
babylonian
life
and
customs
and
we
shall
return
to
it
in
the
chapter
dealing
with
these
subjects
it
will
be

but
the

has
not

unfortunately
little
progress
has
been
made

leadership
in

has
passed
from

which
is
doing
excellent
work
at
bismya
and
although
it
is
too
early
yet
to
expect
detailed
accounts
of
their
achievements
it
is
clear
that
they
have
already
met
with
considerable
success
one
of
their
recent
finds
consists
of
a
white
marble
statue

early
sumerian
king
named
daudu

which
he
was
ruler
from
its
archaic
style
of
workmanship
it
may
be
placed
in
the
earliest
period
of
sumerian
history

may
be
regarded
as
an
earnest
of
what
may
be

to

commercial
documents
but
little
of
historical
interest
and
an
inscription
which
seems
to
have
come
from

proves
that
the
sumerian
name
of
the
city

that

be
said
to

the
problems

more
naturally
be

considerable
light
on
the
rivalry
which
existed
between
the
cities

at
the

time
furnishes
valuable
material
for

the

famous

record

the
treaty
of
delimitation
that
was
drawn
up
on
this
occasion
has
been
preserved
upon
the
recently
discovered
cone

this
document
tells
us
that
at
the
command
of
the
god
enlil
described
as
king
of
the
countries
ningirsu
the
chief
god
of
shirpurla
and
the
god
of
gishkhu
decided
to
draw
up
a
line
of
division
between
their
respective
territories
and
that
mesilim
king
of
kish
acting
under
the
direction
of
his
own
god
kadi
marked
out
the
frontier
and
set
up
a
stele
between
the
two
territories
to
commemorate
the
fixing
of
the
boundary
this
policy
of
fixing
the
boundary
by
arbitration
seems
to
have
been
successful
and
to
have
secured
peace
between
shirpurla
and
gishkhu
for
some
generations
but
after
a
period
which
can
not
be
accurately
determined
a
certain
patesi
of
gishkhu
named
ush
was
filled
with
ambition
to
extend
his
territory
at
the
expense
of
shirpurla
he
therefore
removed
the
stele
which
mesilim
had
set
up
and
invading
the
plain
of
shirpurla
succeeded
in
conquering
and
holding
a
district
named
but
successful
raid
was
not
of
any
permanent
benefit
to
his
city
for
he
was
in
his
turn
defeated
by
the
forces
of
shirpurla
and
his
successor
upon
the
throne
a
patesi
named
enakalli
abandoned
a
policy
of
aggression
and
concluded
with
eannadu
patesi
of
shirpurla
a
solemn
treaty
concerning
the
boundary
between
their
realms
the
text
of
which
has
been
preserved
to
us
upon
the
famous
stele
of
vultures

a
fragment
of
this
stele

according
to
this
treaty
was
restored
to
shirpurla

a
deep
ditch
was
dug
between
the
two
territories
which
should
permanently
indicate
the
line
of
demarcation
the
stele
of
mesilim
was
restored
to
its
place
and
a
second
stele
was
inscribed
and
set
up
as
a
memorial
of
the
new
treaty
enakalli
did
not
negotiate
the
treaty
on
equal
terms
with
eannadu
for
he
only
secured
its
ratification
by
consenting
to
pay
heavy
tribute
in
grain
for
the
supply
of
the
great
temples
of
and
ninâ
in
shirpurla
it
would
appear
that
under
eannadu
the
power
and
influence
of
shirpurla
were
extended
over
the
whole
of
southern
babylonia
and
reached
even
to
the
borders
of
elam
at
any
rate
it
is
clear
that
during
his
lifetime
the
city
of
gishkhu
was
content
to
remain
in
a
state
of
subjection
to
its
more
powerful
neighbour
but
it
was
always
ready
to
seize
any
opportunity
of
asserting
itself
and
of
attempting
to
regain
its
independence

accordingly
after
death
the
men
of
gishkhu
again
took
the
offensive
at
this
time
urlumma
the
son
and
successor
of
enakalli
was
on
the
throne
of
gishkhu
and
he
organized
the
forces
of
the
city
and
led
them
out
to
battle
his
first
act
was
to
destroy
the
frontier
ditches
named
after
ningirsu
and
ninâ
the
principal
god
and
goddess
of
shirpurla
which
eannadu
the
powerful
foe
of
gishkhu
had
caused
to
be
dug
he
then
tore
down
the
stele
on
which
the
terms
of
treaty
had
been
engraved
and
broke
it
into
pieces
by
casting
it
into
the
fire
and
the
shrines
which
eannadu
had
built
near
the
frontier
and
had
consecrated
to
the
gods
of
shirpurla
he
razed
to
the
ground
but
again
shirpurla
in
the
end
proved
too
strong
for
gishkhu
the
ruler
in
shirpurla
at
this
time
was
enannadu
who
had
succeeded
his
brother
eannadu
upon
the
throne
he
marched
out
to
meet
the
invading
forces
of
the
men
of
gishkhu
and
a
battle
was
fought
in
the
territory
of
shirpurla
according
to
one
account
the
forces
of
shirpurla
were
victorious
while
on
the
cone
of
no
mention
is
made
of
the
issue
of
the
combat
the
result
may
not
have
been
decisive
but
action
at
least
checked
encroachments
for
the
time
it
would
appear
that
the
death
of
the
reigning
patesi
in
shirpurla
was
always
the
signal
for
an
attack
upon
that
city
by
the
men
of
gishkhu
they
may
have
hoped
that
the
new
ruler
would
prove
a
less
successful
leader
than
the
last
or
that
the
accession
of
a
new
monarch
might
give
rise
to
internal
dissensions
in
the
city
which
would
weaken
power
of
resisting
a
sudden
attack
as
death
had
encouraged
urlumma
to
lead
out
the
men
of
gishkhu
so
the
death
of
enannadu
seemed
to
him
a
good
opportunity
to
make
another
bid
for
victory
but
this
time
the
result
of
the
battle
was
not
indecisive
entemena
had
succeeded
his
father
enannadu
and
he
led
out
to
victory
the
forces
of
the
battle
was
fought
near
the
canal
and
when
the
men
of
gishkhu
were
put
to
flight
they
left
sixty
of
their
fellows
lying
dead
upon
the
banks
of
the
canal
entemena
tells
us
that
the
bones
of
these
warriors
were
left
to
bleach
in
the
open
plain
but
he
seems
to
have
buried
those
of
the
men
of
gishkhu
who
fell
in
the
pursuit
for
he
records
that
in
five
separate
places
he
piled
up
in
which
the
bodies
of
the
slain
were
interred
entemena
was
not
content
with
merely
inflicting
a
defeat
upon
the
army
of
gishkhu
and
driving
it
back
within
its
own
borders
for
he
followed
up
his
initial
advantage
and
captured
the
capital
itself
he
deposed
and
imprisoned
urlumma
and
chose
one
of
his
own
adherents
to
rule
as

summoned
him
to
his
presence
and
after
marching
in
a
triumphal
procession
from
girsu
in
the
neighbourhood
of
shirpurla
to
the
conquered
city
proceeded
to
invest
him
with
the
office
of
patesi
of
gishkhu
entemena
also
repaired
the
frontier
ditches
named
after
ningirsu
and
ninâ
which
had
been
employed
for
purposes
of
irrigation
as
well
as
for
marking
the
frontier
and
he
gave
instructions
to
hi
to
employ
the
men
dwelling
in
the
district
of
karkar
on
this
work
as
a
punishment
for
the
active
part
they
had
taken
in
the
recent
raid
into
the
territory
of
shirpurla
entemena
also
restored
and
extended
the

resting
on

side
so
as
to
show
the
inscription
but
when
in
use
it
was
set
flat
upon
the

and
partly
buried
below
the
level
of
the

of
the
building
in
which
it
was
used
it
was
fixed
at

the

to
be
brought
from
great
distances
and
they
were
consequently
highly
prized
the
kings
and
patesis
who
used
them
in
their
buildings
generally
had
their
names
and
titles
engraved
upon
them
and
they
thus
form
a
valuable
class
of
inscriptions
for
the
study
of
the
early
history
photograph
by
co
he
thus
added
greatly
to
the
wealth
of
shirpurla
by
increasing
the
area
of
territory
under
cultivation
and
he
continued
to
exercise
authority
in
gishkhu
by
means
of
officers
appointed
by
himself
a
record
of
his
victory
over
gishkhu
was
inscribed
by
entemena
upon
a
number
of
clay
cones
that
the
fame
of
it
might
be
preserved
in
future
days
to
the
honour
of
ningirsu
and
the
goddess
ninâ
he
ends
this
record
with
a
prayer
for
the
preservation
of
the
frontier
if
ever
in
time
to
come
the
men
of
gishkhu
should
break
out
across
the
of
ningirsu
or
the
of
ninâ
in
order
to
seize
or
lay
waste
the
lands
of
shirpurla
whether
they
be
men
of
the
city
of
gishkhu
itself
or
men
of
the
mountains
he
prays
that
enlil
may
destroy
them
and
that
ningirsu
may
lay
his
curse
upon
them
and
if
ever
the
warriors
of
his
own
city
should
be
called
upon
to
defend
it
he
prays
that
they
may
be
full
of
courage
and
ardour
for
their
task
the
greater
part
of
this
information
with
regard
to
the
struggles
between
gishkhu
and
shirpurla
between
the
period
of
mesilim
king
of
kish
and
that
of
entemena
is
supplied
by
the
inscription
of
the
latter
ruler
which
has
been
found
written
around
a
small
cone
of
clay
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
text
was
also
engraved
by
the
orders
of
entemena
upon
a
stone
stele
which
was
set
up
like
those
of
mesilim
and
eannadu
upon
the
frontier
other
copies
of
the
inscription
were
probably
engraved
and
erected
in
the
cities
of
gishkhu
and
shirpurla
and
to
ensure
the
preservation
of
the
record
entemena
probably
had
numerous
copies
of
it
made
upon
small
cones
of
clay
which
were
preserved
and
possibly
buried
in
the
structure
of
the
temples
of
shirpurla
foresight
in
this
matter
has
been
justified
by
results
for
while
his
great
memorials
of
stone
have
perished
the
preservation
of
one
of
his
small
cones
has
sufficed
to
make
known
to
later
ages
his
own
and
his
prowess
in
their
continual
contests
with
their
ancient
rival
gishkhu
after
the
reign
of
entemena
we
have
little
information
with
regard
to
the
relations
between
gishkhu
and
shirpurla
though
it
is
probable
that
the
effects
of
his
decisive
victory
continued
to
exercise
a
moderating
influence
on
desire
for
expansion
and
secured
a
period
of
peaceful
development
for
shirpurla
without
the
continual
fear
of
encroachments
on
the
part
of
her
turbulent
neighbour
we
may
assume
that
this
period
of
tranquillity
continued
during
the
reigns
of
enannadu
ii
enlitarzi
and
but
when
in
the
reign
of
urukagina
the
men
of
gishkhu
once
more
emerge
from
their
temporary
obscurity
they
appear
as
the
authors
of
deeds
of
rapine
and
bloodshed
committed
on
a
scale
that
was
rare
even
in
that
primitive
age
in
the
earlier
stages
of
their
rivalry
gishkhu
had
always
been
defeated
or
at
any
rate
checked
in
her
actual
conflicts
with
shirpurla
when
taking
the
aggressive
the
men
of
gishkhu
seem
generally
to
have
confined
themselves
to
the
seizure
of
territory
such
as
the
district
of
which
was
situated
on
the
western
bank
of
the
shaft
and
divided
from
their
own
lands
only
by
the
if
they
ever
actually
crossed
the
shaft
and
raided
the
lands
on
its
eastern
bank
they
never
ventured
to
attack
the
city
of
shirpurla
itself
and
although
their
raids
were
attended
with
some
success
in
their
initial
stages
the
ruling
patesis
of
shirpurla
were
always
strong
enough
to
check
them
and
on
most
occasions
they
carried
the
war
into
the
territory
of
gishkhu
with
the
result
that
they
readjusted
the
boundary
on
their
own
terms
but
it
would
appear
that
all
these
primitive
chalæan
cities
were
subject
to
alternate
periods
of
expansion
and
defeat
and
shirpurla
was
not
an
exception
to
the
rule
it
was
probably
not
due
so
much
to
personal
qualities
or
defects
as
a
leader
that
shirpurla
suffered
the
greatest
reverse
in
her
history
during
his
reign
but
rather
to
gradual
increase
in
power
at
a
time
when
shirpurla
herself
remained
inactive
possibly
lulled
into
a
false
sense
of
security
by
the
memory
of
her
victories
in
the
past
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
of
final
triumph
it
is
certain
that
it
took
place
in
reign
and
that
for
many
years
afterwards
the
hegemony
of
southern
babylonia
remained
in
her
hands
while
shirpurla
for
a
long
period
passed
completely
out
of
existence
as
an
independent
or
state
the
evidence
of
the
catastrophe
that
befell
shirpurla
at
this
period
is
furnished
by
a
small
clay
tablet
recently
found
at
telloh
during
captain
excavations
on
that
site
the
document
on
which
the
facts
in
question
are
recorded
had
no
official
character
and
in
all
probability
it
had
not
been
stored
in
any
library
or
record
chamber
the
actual
spot
at
telloh
where
it
was
found
was
to
the
north
of
the
mound
in
which
the
most
ancient
buildings
have
been
recovered
and
at
the
depth
of
two
metres
below
the
surface
no
other
tablets
appear
to
have
been
found
near
it
but
that
fact
in
itself
would
not
be
sufficient
evidence
on
which
to
base
any
theory
as
to
its
not
having
originally
formed
part
of
the
archives
of
the
city
its
unofficial
character
is
attested
by
the
form
of
the
tablet
and
the
manner
in
which
the
information
upon
it
is
arranged
in
shape
there
is
little
to
distinguish
the
document
from
the
tablets
of
accounts
inscribed
in
the
reign
of
urukagina
great
numbers
of
which
have
been
found
recently
at
telloh
roughly
square
in
shape
its
edges
are
slightly
convex
and
the
text
is
inscribed
in
a
series
of
narrow
columns
upon
both
the
obverse
and
the
reverse
the
text
itself
is
not
a
carefully
arranged
composition
such
as
are
the
votive
and
historical
inscriptions
of
early
sumerian
rulers
it
consists
of
a
series
of
short
sentences
enumerating
briefly
and
without
detail
the
separate
deeds
of
violence
and
sacrilege
performed
by
the
men
of
gishkhu
after
their
capture
of
the
city
it
is
little
more
than
a
catalogue
or
list
of
the
shrines
and
temples
destroyed
during
the
sack
of
the
city
or
defiled
by
the
blood
of
the
men
of
shirpurla
who
were
slain
therein
no
mention
is
made
in
the
list
of
the
palace
of
the
urukagina
or
of
any
secular
building
or
of
the
dwellings
of
the
citizens
themselves
there
is
little
doubt
that
these
also
were
despoiled
and
destroyed
by
the
victorious
enemy
but
the
writer
of
the
tablet
is
not
concerned
for
the
moment
with
the
fate
of
his
city
or
his
fellow
citizens
he
appears
to
be
overcome
with
the
thought
of
the
deeds
of
sacrilege
committed
against
his
gods
his
mind
is
entirely
taken
up
with
the
magnitude
of
the
insult
offered
to
the
god
ningirsu
the
of
shirpurla
his
bare
enumeration
of
the
deeds
of
sacrilege
and
violence
loses
little
by
its
brevity
and
when
he
has
ended
the
list
of
his
accusations
against
the
men
of
gishkhu
he
curses
the
goddess
to
whose
influence
he
attributes
their
success
no
composition
at
all
like
this
document
has
yet
been
recovered
and
as
it
is
not
very
long
we
may
here
give
a
translation
of
the
text
it
will
be
seen
that
the
writer
plunges
at
once
into
the
subject
of
his
charges
against
the
men
of
gishkhu
no
historical
prefaces
his
accusations
and
he
gives
no
hint
of
the
circumstances
that
have
rendered
their
delivery
possible
the
temples
of
his
city
have
been
profaned
and
destroyed
and
his
indignation
finds
vent
in
a
mere
enumeration
of
their
titles
to
his
mind
the
facts
need
no
comment
for
to
him
it
is
barely
conceivable
that
such
sacred
places
of
ancient
worship
should
have
been
defiled
he
launches
his
indictment
against
gishkhu
in
the
following
terms
men
of
gishkhu
have
set
fire
to
the
temple
of

so

the

by
the
despoiling
of
shirpurla
have
committed
a
transgression
against
the
god
ningirsu
the
power
that
is
come
unto
them
from
them
shall
be
taken
away
of
transgression
on
the
part
of
urukagina
king
of
girsu
there
is
none
as
for
lugalzaggisi
patesi
of
gishkhu
may
his
goddess
bear
on
her
head
the
weight
of
this
transgression
such
is
the
account
which
has
come
down
to
us
from
the
rough
tablet
of
some
unknown
scribe
of
the
greatest
misfortune
experienced
by
shirpurla
during
the
long
course
of
her
history
many
of
the
great
temples
mentioned
in
the
text
as
among
those
which
were
burnt
down
and
despoiled
of
their
treasures
are
referred
to
more
than
once
in
the
votive
and
historical
inscriptions
of
earlier
rulers
of
shirpurla
who
occupied
the
throne
before
the
urukagina
the
names
of
some
of
them
too
are
to
be
found
in
the
texts
of
the
later
of
that
city
so
that
it
may
be
concluded
that
in
course
of
time
they
were
rebuilt
and
restored
to
their
former
splendour
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
despoiling
and
partial
destruction
of
shirpurla
in
the
reign
of
urukagina
had
a
lasting
effect
upon
the
fortunes
of
that
city
and
effectively
curtailed
her
influence
among
the
greater
cities
of
southern
babylonia
we
may
now
turn
our
attention
to
the
leader
of
the
men
of
gishkhu
under
whose
direction
they
achieved
their
final
triumph
over
their
ancient
and
for
long
years
more
powerful
rival
shirpurla
the
writer
of
our
tablet
mentions
his
name
in
the
closing
words
of
his
text
when
he
curses
him
and
his
goddess
for
the
destruction
and
sacrilege
that
they
have
wrought
for
lugalzaggisi
he
says
of
gishkhu
may
his
goddess
nidaba
bear
on
her
head
the
weight
of
this
transgression
now
the
name
of
lugalzaggisi
has
been
found
upon
a
number
of
fragments
of
vases
made
of
white
calcite
stalagmite
which
were
discovered
by
haynes
during
his
excavations
at
nippur
all
the
vases
were
engraved
with
the
same
inscription
so
that
it
was
possible
by
piecing
the
fragments
of
text
together
to
obtain
a
more
or
less
complete
copy
of
the
records
which
were
originally
engraved
upon
each
of
them
from
these
records
we
learned
for
the
first
time
not
only
the
name
of
lugalzaggisi
but
the
fact
that
he
founded
a
powerful
coalition
of
cities
in
babylonia
at
what
was
obviously
a
very
early
period
in
the
history
of
the
country
in
the
text
he
describes
himself
as
of
erech
king
of
the
world
the
priest
of
ana
the
hero
of
nidaba
the
son
of
ukush
patesi
of
gishkhu
the
hero
of
nidaba
the
man
who
was
favourably
regarded
by
the
sure
eye
of
the
king
of
the
lands
the
god
enlil
the
great
patesi
of
enlil
unto
whom
understanding
was
granted
by
enki
the
chosen
of
the
the
exalted
minister
of
enzu
endowed
with
strength
by
the
the
worshipper
of
ninni
the
son
who
was
conceived
by
nidaba
who
was
nourished
by
ninkharsag
with
the
milk
of
life
the
attendant
of
umu
priestess
of
erech
the
servant
who
was
trained
by
ninâgidkhadu
the
mistress
of
erech
the
great
minister
of
the
lugalzaggisi
then
goes
on
to
describe
the
extent
of
his
dominion
and
he
says
the
god
enlil
the
lord
of
the
countries
bestowed
upon
lugalzaggisi
the
kingdom
of
the
world
and
granted
unto
him
success
in
the
sight
of
the
world
when
he
filled
the
lands
with
his
power
and
conquered
them
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
unto
the
setting
of
the
same
at
that
time
he
made
straight
his
path
from
the
lower
sea
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
unto
the
upper
sea
and
he
granted
him
dominion
over
all
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
unto
the
setting
of
the
same
so
that
he
caused
the
lands
to
dwell
in
now
when
first
the
text
of
this
inscription
was
published
there
existed
only
vague
indications
of
the
date
to
be
assigned
to
lugalzaggisi
and
the
kingdom
that
he
founded
it
was
clear
from
the
titles
which
he
bore
that
though
gishkhu
was
his
native
place
he
had
extended
his
authority
far
beyond
that
city
and
had
chosen
erech
as
his
capital
moreover
he
claimed
an
empire
extending
from
lower
sea
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
unto
the
upper
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
lower
sea
here
mentioned
is
the
persian
gulf
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
upper
sea
may
be
taken
to
be
the
mediterranean
though
it
may
possibly
have
been
lake
van
or
lake
urmi
but
whichever
of
these
views
might
be
adopted
it
was
clear
that
lugalzaggisi
was
a
great
conqueror
and
had
achieved
the
right
to
assume
the
title
of
lugal
halama
of
the
in
these
circumstances
it
was
of
the
first
importance
for
the
study
of
primitive
chaldæan
history
and
chronology
to
ascertain
approximately
the
period
at
which
lugalzaggisi
reigned
the
evidence
on
which
such
a
question
could
be
provisionally
settled
was
of
the
vaguest
and
most
uncertain
character
but
such
as
it
was
it
had
to
suffice
in
the
absence
of
more
reliable
data
in
settling
all
problems
connected
with
early
chaldæan
chronology
the
was
and
in
fact
still
is
the
period
of
sargon
i
king
of
agade
inasmuch
as
the
date
of
his
reign
is
settled
according
to
the
reckoning
of
the
scribes
of
nabonidus
as
about
it
is
true
that
this
date
has
been
called
in
question
and
ingenious
suggestions
for
amending
it
have
been
made
by
some
writers
while
others
have
rejected
it
altogether
holding
that
it
merely
represented
a
guess
on
the
part
of
the
late
babylonians
and
could
be
safely
ignored
in
the
chronological
schemes
which
they
brought
forward
but
nearly
every
fresh
discovery
made
in
the
last
few
years
has
tended
to
confirm
some
point
in
the
traditions
current
among
the
later
babylonians
with
regard
to
the
earlier
history
of
their
country
consequently
reliance
may
be
placed
with
increased
confidence
on
the
truth
of
such
traditions
as
a
whole
and
we
may
continue
to
accept
those
statements
which
yet
await
confirmation
from
documents
more
nearly
contemporary
with
the
early
period
to
which
they
refer
it
is
true
that
such
a
date
as
that
assigned
by
nabonidus
to
sargon
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
absolutely
fixed
for
nabonidus
is
obviously
speaking
in
round
numbers
and
we
may
allow
for
some
minor
inaccuracies
in
the
calculations
of
his
scribes
but
it
is
certain
that
the
later
babylonian
priests
and
scribes
had
a
wealth
of
historical
material
at
their
disposal
which
has
not
come
down
to
us
we
may
therefore
accept
the
date
given
by
nabonidus
for
sargon
of
agade
and
his
son
as
approximately
accurate
and
this
is
also
the
opinion
of
the
majority
of
writers
on
early
babylonian
history
the
diggings
at
nippur
furnished
indications
that
certain
inscriptions
found
on
that
site
and
written
in
a
very
archaic
form
of
script
were
to
be
assigned
to
a
period
earlier
than
that
of
sargon
one
class
of
evidence
was
obtained
from
a
careful
study
of
the
different
levels
at
which
the
inscriptions
and
the
remains
of
buildings
were
found
at
a
comparatively
deep
level
in
the
mound
inscriptions
of
sargon
himself
were
recovered
along
with
bricks
stamped
with
the
name
of
his
son
it
was
therefore
a
reasonable
conclusion
roughly
to
date
the
particular
stratum
in
which
these
objects
were
found
to
the
period
of
the
empire
established
by
sargon
with
its
centre
at
agade
later
on
excavations
were
carried
to
a
lower
level
and
remains
of
buildings
were
discovered
which
appeared
to
belong
to
a
still
earlier
period
of
civilization
an
altar
was
found
standing
in
a
small
enclosure
surrounded
by
a
kind
of
curb
near
by
were
two
immense
clay
vases
which
appeared
to
have
been
placed
on
a
ramp
or
inclined
plane
leading
up
to
the
altar
and
remains
were
also
found
of
a
massive
brick
building
in
which
was
an
arch
of
brick
no
inscriptions
were
actually
found
at
this
level
but
in
the
upper
level
assigned
to
sargon
were
a
number
of
texts
which
might
very
probably
be
assigned
to
the
period
none
of
these
were
complete
and
they
had
the
appearance
of
having
been
intentionally
broken
into
small
fragments
there
was
therefore
something
to
be
said
for
the
theory
that
they
might
have
been
inscribed
by
the
builders
of
the
construction
in
the
lowest
levels
of
the
mound
and
that
they
were
destroyed
and
scattered
by
some
conqueror
who
had
laid
their
city
in
ruins
but
all
such
evidence
derived
from
noting
the
levels
at
which
inscriptions
are
found
is
in
its
nature
extremely
uncertain
and
liable
to
many
different
interpretations
especially
if
the
strata
show
signs
of
having
been
disturbed
where
a
pavement
or
building
is
still
intact
with
the
inscribed
bricks
of
the
builder
remaining
in
their
original
positions
conclusions
may
be
confidently
drawn
with
regard
to
the
age
of
the
building
and
its
relative
antiquity
to
the
strata
above
and
below
it
but
the
strata
in
the
lowest
levels
at
nippur
as
we
have
seen
were
not
in
this
condition
and
such
evidence
as
they
furnished
could
only
be
accepted
if
confirmed
by
independent
data
such
confirmation
was
to
be
found
by
examination
of
the
early
inscriptions
themselves
it
has
been
remarked
that
most
of
them
were
broken
into
small
pieces
as
though
by
some
invader
of
the
country
but
this
was
not
the
case
with
certain
and
great
blocks
of
diorite
which
were
too
hard
and
big
to
be
easily
broken
moreover
any
conqueror
of
a
city
would
be
unlikely
to
spend
time
and
labour
in
destroying
materials
which
might
be
usefully
employed
in
the
construction
of
other
buildings
which
he
himself
might
erect
stone
could
not
be
obtained
in
the
alluvial
plains
of
babylonia
and
had
to
be
quarried
in
the
mountains
and
brought
great
distances

by
mansell
from

predecessors
which
he
razed
to
the
ground
an
invader
would
therefore
remove
the
and
blocks
of
stone
for
his
own
use
supposing
he
contemplated
building
on
the
site
if
he
left
the

in
ruins
and
returned
to
his
own
country
some
subsequent
king
when
clearing
the
ruined
site
for
building
operations
might
come
across
the
stones
and
he
would
not
leave
them
buried
but
would
use
them
for
his
own
construction
and
this
is
what
actually
did
happen
in
the
case
of
some
of
the
building
materials
of
one
of
these
early
kings
from
the
lower
strata
of
nippur
certain
of
the
blocks
which
bore
the
name
of
lugalkigubnidudu
had
been
used
again
by
sargon
king
of
agade
who
engraved
his
own
name
upon
them
without
obliterating
the
name
of
the
former
king
it
followed
that
lugalkigubnidudu
belonged
to
the
period
and
although
the
same
conclusive
evidence
was
not
forthcoming
in
the
case
of
he
also
without
much
hesitation
was
set
in
this
early
period
mainly
on
the
strength
of
the
archaic
forms
of
the
characters
employed
in
his
inscriptions
in
fact
they
were
held
to
be
so
archaic
that
not
only
was
he
said
to
have
reigned
before
sargon
of
agade
but
he
was
set
in
the
very
earliest
period
of
chaldæan
history
and
his
empire
was
supposed
to
have
been
contemporaneous
with
the
very
earliest
rulers
of
shirpurla
the
new
inscription
found
by
captain
cros
will
cause
this
opinion
to
be
considerably
modified
while
it
corroborates
the
view
that
lugalzaggisi
is
to
be
set
in
the
period
it
proves
that
he
lived
and
reigned
very
shortly
before
him
as
we
have
already
seen
he
was
the
contemporary
of
urukagina
who
belongs
to
the
middle
period
of
the
history
of
shirpurla
capture
and
sack
of
the
city
of
shirpurla
was
only
one
of
a
number
of
conquests
which
he
achieved
his
father
ukush
had
been
merely
patesi
of
the
city
of
but
he
himself
was
not
content
with
the
restricted
sphere
of
authority
which
such
a
position
implied
and
he
eventually
succeeded
in
enforcing
his
authority
over
the
greater
part
of
babylonia
from
the
fact
that
he
styles
himself
king
of
erech
we
may
conclude
that
he
removed
his
capital
from
ukush
to
that
city
after
having
probably
secured
its
submission
by
force
of
arms
in
fact
his
title

of

only
have
been
won

the
result

many
victories

us
a
glimpse
of
the
methods
by
which
he
managed
to
secure
himself
against

competition

any
rival
the
capture
of
shirpurla
must
have
been
one
of
his
earliest
achievements

its
proximity

its

a
necessary
prelude

any
more
extensive

not

endured

grishkhu

shirpurla
as
well
as
the
other
ancient
cities
in
the

in

under
his
domination

formed
part
of
the
extensive
empire

he
ruled

the
later

to
tell
us
which

his
history
of
this
period
the
tablets
found
at
telloh
by
the
late
de
sarzec
and
published
during
his
lifetime
fall
into
two
main
classes
which
date
from
different
periods
in
early
chaldæan
history
the
great
majority
belong
to
the
period
when
the
city
of
ur
held
among
the
cities
of
southern
babylonia
and
they
are
dated
in
the
reigns
of
dungi
sin
and
the
other
and
smaller
collection
belongs
to
the
earlier
period
of
sargon
and
while
many
of
the
tablets
found
in
de
last
diggings
which
were
published
after
his
death
are
to
be
set
in
the
great
gap
between
these
two
periods
some
of
those
recently
discovered
which
belong
to
the
period
of
dungi
contain
memoranda
concerning
the
supply
of
food
for
the
maintenance
of
officials
stopping
at
shirpurla
in
the
course
of
journeys
in
babylonia
and
elam
and
they
throw
an
interesting
light
on
the
close
and
constant
communication
which
took
place
at
this
time
between
the
great
cities
of
mesopotamia
and
the
neighbouring
countries

now
been
ascertained
from

that

for

sacked
babylon
and
carried
off
its
spoil

such
episodes
must
have
been
common
at
this
period

city
was
striving
for
hegemony
meanwhile
shirpurla
remained
the
centre
of
sumerian
influence
in
babylonia

her
patesis
were
content
to
owe
allegiance
to
so
powerful

have
been
thrown

portion
of

mound
on
lifting
it
from
the
trench
it
was
seen

the
head
of
the
statue
was
broken
off
as
is
the
case
with
all
the
other
statues
of

the
statue
bore
an
inscription

carefully
executed
and
well
preserved
but
it
was
smaller
than
other
statues
of
the
same
ruler
that
had
been
already
recovered
and
the
absence
of
the
head
thus
robbed
it
of
any
extraordinary
interest
on
its
arrival
at
the
louvre
léon
heuzey
was
struck
by
its
general
resemblance
to
a
sumerian
head
of
diorite
formerly
discovered
by

at

which
has
been
preserved
in
the
louvre
for
many
years
on
applying
the

to

it
was
found
to
fit

thus
enabled

the
features

ningishzida
is
called
in
the
inscription
the
son
of
ninazu
who
was
the
husband
of
the
queen
of
the
underworld
in
one
of
his
aspects
he
was
therefore
probably
a
god
of
the
underworld
himself
and
it
is
in
this
character
that
he
was
appointed
by
ningirsu
as
guardian
of
the
foundations
but
hills
and
the
open
country
were
also
put
under
his
jurisdiction
so
that
in
another
aspect
he
was
a
god
of
vegetation
it
is
therefore
not
improbable
that
like
the
god
dumuzi
or
tammuz
he
was
supposed
to
descend
into
the
underworld
in
winter
ascending
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
with
the
earliest
green
shoots
of
vegetation
in
the
spring

a
most
valuable
contribution
has
recently
been
made
to
our
knowledge
of
sumerian
religion
and
of
the
light
in
which
these
early
rulers
regarded
the
cult
and
worship
of
their
gods
by
the
complete
interpretation
of
the
long
texts
inscribed
upon
the
famous
cylinders
of
gudea
the
patesi
of
shirpurla
which
have
been
preserved
for
many
years
in
the
louvre
these
two
great
cylinders
of
baked
clay
were
discovered
by
the
late
de
sarzec
so
long
ago
as
the
year
during
the
first
period
of
his
diggings
at
telloh
and
although
the
general
nature
of
their
contents
has
long
been
recognized
no
complete
translation
of
the
texts
inscribed
upon
them
had
been
published
until
a
few
months
ago
who
has
made
the
early
sumerian
texts
his
special
study
has
devoted
himself
to
their
interpretation
for
some
years
past
and
he
has
just
issued
the
first
part
of
his
monograph
upon
them
in
view
of
the
importance
of
the
texts
and
of
the
light
they
throw
upon
the
religious
beliefs
and
practices
of
the
early
sumerians
a
somewhat
detailed
account
of
their
contents
may
here
be
given
the
occasion
on
which
the
cylinders
were
made
was
the
rebuilding
by
gudea
of
the
great
temple
of
the
god
ningirsu
in
the
city
of
shirpurla
the
two
cylinders
supplement
one
another
one
of
them
having
been
inscribed
while
the
work
of
construction
was
still
in
progress
the
other
after
the
completion
of
the
temple
when
the
god
ningirsu
had
been
installed
within
his
shrine
with
due
pomp
and
ceremony
it
would
appear
that
southern
babylonia
had
been
suffering
from
a
prolonged
drought
and
that
the
water
in
the
rivers
and
canals
had
fallen
so
that
the
crops
had
suffered
and
the
country
was
threatened
with
famine
gudea
was
at
a
loss
to
know
by
what
means
he
might
restore
prosperity
to
his
country
when
one
night
he
had
a
dream
and
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
dream
that
he
eventually
erected
one
of
the
most
sumptuously
appointed
of
sumerian
temples
by
this
means
he
secured
the
return
of
favour
and
that
of
the
other
gods
and
his
country
once
more
enjoyed
the
blessings
of
peace
and
prosperity
in
the
opening
words
of
the
first
of
his
cylinders
gudea
describes
how
the
great
gods
themselves
took
counsel
and
decreed
that
he
should
build
the
temple
of
and
thereby
restore
to
his
city
the
supply
of
water
it
had
formerly
enjoyed
he
records
that
on
the
day
on
which
the
destinies
were
fixed
in
heaven
and
upon
earth
enlil
the
chief
of
the
gods
and
ningirsu
the
of
shirpurla
held
converse
and
enlil
turning
to
ningirsu
said
my
city
that
which
is
fitting
is
not
done
the
stream
doth
not
rise
the
stream
of
enlil
doth
not
rise
the
high
waters
shine
not
neither
do
they
show
their
splendour
the
stream
of
enlil
bringeth
not
good
water
like
the
tigris
let
the
king
ningirsu
therefore
proclaim
the
temple
let
the
decrees
of
the
temple
be
made
illustrious
in
heaven
and
upon
earth
the
great
gods
did
not
communicate
their
orders
directly
to
gudea
but
conveyed
their
wishes
to
him
by
means
of
a
dream
and
while
the
patesi
slept
a
vision
of
the
night
came
to
him
and
he
beheld
a
man
whose
stature
was
so
great
that
it
equalled
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
by
the
crown
he
wore
upon
his
head
gudea
knew
that
the
figure
must
be
a
god
and
by
his
side
was
the
divine
eagle
the
emblem
of
shirpurla
and
his
feet
rested
upon
the
whirlwind
and
a
lion
was
crouching
upon
his
right
hand
and
upon
his
left
and
the
figure
spoke
to
the
patesi
but
he
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
then
it
seemed
to
gudea
that
the
sun
rose
from
the
earth
and
he
beheld
a
woman
holding
in
her
hand
a
pure
reed
and
she
carried
also
a
tablet
on
which
was
a
star
of
the
heavens
and
she
seemed
to
take
counsel
with
herself
and
while
gudea
was
gazing
he
seemed
to
see
a
second
man
who
was
like
a
warrior
and
he
carried
a
slab
of
lapis
lazuli
and
on
it
he
drew
out
the
plan
of
a
temple
and
before
the
patesi
himself
it
seemed
that
a
fair
cushion
was
placed
and
upon
the
cushion
was
set
a
mould
and
within
the
mould
was
a
brick
the
brick
of
destiny
and
on
the
right
hand
the
patesi
beheld
an
ass
which
lay
upon
the
ground
such
was
the
dream
which
gudea
beheld
in
a
vision
of
the
night
and
he
was
troubled
because
he
could
not
interpret
it
so
he
decided
to
go
to
the
goddess
ninâ
who
could
divine
all
mysteries
of
the
gods
and
beseech
her
to
tell
him
the
meaning
of
the
vision
but
before
applying
to
the
goddess
for
her
help
he
thought
it
best
to
secure
the
mediation
of
the
god
ningirsu
and
the
goddess
gatumdug
in
order
that
they
should
use
their
influence
with
ninâ
to
induce
her
to
reveal
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
so
the
patesi
set
out
to
the
temple
of
ningirsu
and
having
offered
a
sacrifice
and
poured
out
fresh
water
he
prayed
to
the
god
that
his
sister
ninâ
the
child
of
eridu
might
be
prevailed
upon
to
give
him
help
and
the
god
hearkened
to
his
prayer
then
gudea
made
offerings
and
before
the
of
the
goddess
gatumdug
he
offered
a
sacrifice
and
poured
out
fresh
water
and
he
prayed
to
the
goddess
calling
her
his
queen
and
the
child
of
the
pure
heaven
who
gave
life
to
the
countries
and
befriended
and
preserved
the
people
or
the
man
on
whom
she
looked
with
favour
have
no
mother
cried
gudea
thou
art
my
mother
i
have
no
father
but
thou
art
a
father
to
me
and
the
goddess
gatumdug
gave
ear
to
the
prayer
thus
encouraged
by
her
favour
and
that
of
ningirsu
gudea
set
out
for
the
temple
of
the
goddess
ninâ
on
his
arrival
at
the
temple
the
patesi
offered
a
sacrifice
and
poured
out
fresh
water
as
he
had
already
done
when
approaching
the
presence
of
ningirsu
and
gatumdug
and
he
prayed
to
ninâ
as
the
goddess
who
divines
the
secrets
of
the
gods
beseeching
her
to
interpret
the
vision
that
had
been
sent
to
him
and
he
then
recounted
to
her
the
details
of
his
dream
when
the
patesi
had
finished
his
story
the
goddess
addressed
him
and
told
him
that
she
would
explain
the
meaning
of
his
dream
to
him
and
this
was
the
interpretation
of
the
dream
the
man
whose
stature
was
so
great
that
it
equalled
the
heavens
and
the
earth
whose
head
was
that
of
a
god
at
whose
side
was
the
divine
eagle
whose
feet
rested
on
the
whirlwind
while
a
lion
couched
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
was
her
brother
the
god
ningirsu
and
the
words
which
he
uttered
were
an
order
to
the
patesi
that
he
should
build
the
temple
and
the
sun
which
rose
from
the
earth
before
the
patesi
was
the
god
ningishzida
for
like
the
sun
he
goes
forth
from
the
earth
and
the
maiden
who
held
a
pure
reed
in
her
hand
and
carried
the
tablet
with
the
star
was
her
sister
the
goddess
nidaba
the
star
was
the
pure
star
of
the
construction
which
she
proclaimed
and
the
second
man
who
was
like
a
warrior
and
carried
the
slab
of
lapis
lazuli
was
the
god
nindub
and
the
plan
of
the
temple
which
he
drew
was
the
plan
of
and
the
brick
which
rested
in
its
mould
upon
the
cushion
was
the
sacred
brick
of
and
as
for
the
ass
which
lay
upon
the
ground
that
the
goddess
said
was
the
patesi
himself
having
interpreted
the
meaning
of
the
dream
the
goddess
ninâ
proceeded
to
give
gudea
instruction
as
to
how
he
should
go
to
work
to
build
the
temple
she
told
him
first
of
all
to
go
to
his
and
bring
forth
his
treasures
from
their
sealed
cases
and
out
of
these
to
make
certain
offerings
which
he
was
to
place
near
the
god
ningirsu
in
the
temple
in
which
he
was
dwelling
at
that
time
the
offerings
were
to
consist
of
a
chariot
adorned
with
pure
metal
and
precious
stones
bright
arrows
in
a
quiver
the
weapon
of
the
god
his
sacred
emblem
on
which
gudea
was
to
inscribe
his
own
name
and
finally
a
lyre
the
music
of
which
was
wont
to
soothe
the
god
when
he
took
counsel
with
himself
ninâ
added
that
if
the
patesi
carried
out
her
instructions
and
made
the
offerings
she
had
specified
ningirsu
would
reveal
to
him
the
plan
on
which
the
temple
was
to
be
built
and
would
also
bless
him
gudea
bowed
himself
down
in
token
of
his
submission
to
the
commands
of
the
goddess
and
proceeded
to
execute
them
forthwith
he
brought
out
his
treasures
and
from
the
precious
woods
and
metals
which
he
possessed
his
craftsmen
fashioned
the
objects
he
was
to
present
and
he
set
them
in
temple
near
to
the
god
he
worked
day
and
night
and
having
prepared
a
suitable
spot
in
the
precincts
of
the
temple
at
the
place
of
judgment
he
spread
out
upon
it
as
offerings
a
fat
sheep
and
a
kid
and
the
skin
of
a
young
female
kid
then
he
built
a
fire
of
cypress
and
cedar
and
other
aromatic
woods
to
make
a
sweet
savour
and
entering
the
inner
chamber
of
the
temple
he
offered
a
prayer
to
ningirsu
he
said
that
he
wished
to
build
the
temple
but
he
had
received
no
sign
that
this
was
the
will
of
the
god
and
he
prayed
for
a
sign
while
he
prayed
the
patesi
was
stretched
out
upon
the
ground
and
the
god
standing
near
his
head
then
answered
him
he
said
that
he
who
should
build
his
temple
was
none
other
than
gudea
and
that
he
would
give
him
the
sign
for
which
he
asked
but
first
he
described
the
plan
on
which
the
temple
was
to
be
built
naming
its
various
shrines
and
chambers
and
describing
the
manner
in
which
they
were
to
be
fashioned
and
adorned
and
the
god
promised
that
when
gudea
should
build
the
temple
the
land
would
once
more
enjoy
abundance
for
ningirsu
would
send
a
wind
which
should
proclaim
to
the
heavens
the
return
of
the
waters
and
on
that
day
the
waters
would
fall
from
the
heavens
the
water
in
the
ditches
and
canals
would
rise
and
water
would
gush
out
from
the
dry
clefts
in
the
ground
and
the
great
fields
would
once
more
produce
their
crops
and
oil
would
be
poured
out
plenteously
in
sumer
sp
and
wool
would
again
be
weighed
in
great
abundance
in
that
day
the
god
would
go
to
the
mountain
where
dwelt
the
whirlwind
and
he
would
himself
direct
the
wind
which
should
give
the
land
the
breath
of
life
gudea
must
therefore
work
day
and
night
at
the
task
of
building
the
temple
one
company
of
men
was
to
relieve
another
at
its
toil
and
during
the
night
the
men
were
to
kindle
lights
so
that
the
plain
should
be
as
bright
as
day
thus
the
builders
would
build
continuously
men
were
also
to
be
sent
to
the
mountains
to
cut
down
cedars
and
pines
and
other
trees
and
bring
their
trunks
to
the
city
while
masons
were
to
go
to
the
mountains
and
were
to
cut
and
transport
huge
blocks
of
stone
to
be
used
in
the
construction
of
the
temple
finally
the
god
gave
gudea
the
sign
for
which
he
asked
the
sign
was
that
he
should
feel
his
side
touched
as
by
a
flame
and
thereby
he
should
know
that
he
was
the
man
chosen
by
ningirsu
to
carry
out
his
commands
gudea
bowed
his
head
in
submission
and
his
first
act
was
to
consult
the
omens
and
the
omens
were
favourable
he
then
proceeded
to
purify
the
city
by
special
rites
so
that
the
mother
when
angered
did
not
chide
her
son
and
the
master
did
not
strike
his
head
and
the
mistress
though
provoked
by
her
handmaid
did
not
smite
her
face
and
gudea
drove
all
the
evil
wizards
and
sorcerers
from
the
city
and
he
purified
and
sanctified
the
city
completely
then
he
kindled
a
great
fire
of
cedar
and
other
aromatic
woods
to
make
a
sweet
savour
for
the
gods
and
prayers
were
offered
day
and
night
and
the
patesi
addressed
a
prayer
to
the
or
spirits
of
the
earth
who
dwelt
in
shirpurla
and
assigned
a
place
to
them
in
the
temple
then
having
completed
his
purification
of
the
city
itself
he
consecrated
its
immediate
surroundings
thus
he
consecrated
the
district
of
whence
the
revenues
of
ningirsu
were
derived
and
the
lands
of
the
goddess
ninâ
with
their
populous
villages
and
he
consecrated
the
wild
and
savage
bulls
which
no
man
could
turn
aside
and
the
cedars
which
were
sacred
to
ningirsu
and
the
cattle
of
the
plains
and
he
consecrated
the
armed
men
and
the
famous
warriors
and
the
warriors
of
the
and
the
emblems
of
the
god
ningirsu
and
of
the
two
great
goddesses
ninâ
and
ninni
he
installed
before
them
in
their
shrines
then
gudea
sent
far
and
wide
to
fetch
materials
for
the
construction
of
the
temple
and
the
elamite
came
from
elani
and
men
of
susa
came
from
susa
and
men
brought
wood
from
the
mountains
of
sinai
and
and
into
the
mountain
of
cedars
where
no
man
before
had
penetrated
the
patesi
cut
a
road
and
he
brought
cedars
and
beams
of
other
precious
woods
in
great
quantities
to
the
city
and
he
also
made
a
road
into
the
mountain
where
stone
was
quarried
into
places
where
no
man
before
had
penetrated
and
he
carried
great
blocks
of
stone
down
from
the
mountain
and
loaded
them
into
barges
and
brought
them
to
the
city
and
the
barges
brought
bitumen
and
plaster
and
they
were
loaded
as
though
they
were
carrying
grain
and
all
manner
of
great
things
were
brought
to
the
city
copper
ore
was
brought
from
the
mountain
of
copper
in
the
land
of
kimash
and
gold
was
brought
in
powder
from
the
mountains
and
silver
was
brought
from
the
mountains
and
porphyry
from
the
land
of
melukhkha
and
marble
from
the
mountain
of
marble
and
the
patesi
installed
goldsmiths
and
silversmiths
who
wrought
in
these
precious
metals
for
the
adornment
of
the
temple
and
he
brought
smiths
who
worked
in
copper
and
lead
who
were
priests
of
in
his
search
for
fitting
materials
for
the
building
of
the
temple
gudea
journeyed
from
the
lower
country
to
the
upper
country
and
from
the
upper
country
to
the
lower
country
he
returned
the
only
other
materials
now
wanting
for
the
construction
of
the
temple
were
the
bricks
of
clay
of
which
the
temple
platform
and
the
structure
of
the
temple
itself
were
in
the
main
composed
their
manufacture
was
now
inaugurated
by
a
symbolical
ceremony
carried
out
by
the
patesi
in
person
at
dawn
he
performed
an
ablution
with
the
fitting
rites
that
accompanied
it
and
when
the
day
was
more
advanced
he
slew
a
bull
and
a
kid
as
sacrifices
and
he
then
entered
the
temple
of
ningirsu
where
he
prostrated
himself
and
he
took
the
sacred
mould
and
the
fair
cushion
on
which
it
rested
in
the
temple
and
he
poured
a
libation
into
the
mould
afterwards
having
made
offerings
of
honey
and
butter
and
having
burnt
incense
he
placed
the
cushion
and
the
mould
upon
his
head
and
carried
it
to
the
appointed
place
there
he
placed
clay
in
the
mould
shaping
it
into
a
brick
and
he
left
the
brick
in
its
mould
within
the
temple
and
last
of
all
he
sprinkled
oil
of
around
the
next
day
at
dawn
gudea
broke
the
mould
and
set
the
brick
in
the
sun
and
the
was
rejoiced
at
the
brick
that
he
had
fashioned
and
gudea
took
the
brick
and
raised
it
on
high
towards
the
heavens
and
he
carried
the
brick
to
his
people
in
this
way
the
patesi
inaugurated
the
manufacture
of
the
bricks
for
the
temple
the
sacred
brick
which
he
had
made
being
the
symbol
and
pattern
of
the
innumerable
bricks
to
be
used
in
its
construction
he
then
marked
out
the
plan
of
the
temple
and
the
text
states
that
he
devoted
himself
to
the
building
of
the
temple
like
a
young
man
who
has
begun
building
a
house
and
allows
no
pleasure
to
interfere
with
his
task
and
he
chose
out
skilled
workmen
and
employed
them
on
the
building
and
he
was
filled
with
joy
the
gods
too
are
stated
to
have
helped
with
the
building
for
enki
fixed
the
temennu
of
the
temple
and
the
goddess
ninâ
looked
after
its
oracles
and
gatumdug
the
mother
of
fashioned
bricks
for
it
morning
and
evening
while
the
goddess
bau
sprinkled
aromatic
oil
of
gudea
himself
laid
its
foundations
and
as
he
did
so
he
blessed
the
temple
seven
times
comparing
it
to
the
sacred
brick
to
the
holy
to
the
divine
eagle
of
shirpurla
to
a
terrible
couching
panther
to
the
beautiful
heavens
to
the
day
of
offerings
and
to
the
morning
light
which
brightens
the
land
he
caused
the
temple
to
rise
towards
heaven
like
a
mountain
or
like
a
cedar
growing
in
the
desert
he
built
it
of
bricks
of
sumer
and
the
timbers
which
he
set
in
place
were
as
strong
as
the
dragon
of
the
deep
while
he
was
engaged
on
the
building
gudea
took
counsel
of
the
god
enki
and
he
built
a
fountain
for
the
gods
where
they
might
drink
with
the
great
stones
which
he
had
brought
and
fashioned
he
built
a
reservoir
and
a
basin
for
the
temple
and
seven
of
the
great
stones
he
set
up
as
stelæ
and
he
gave
them
favourable
names
the
text
then
recounts
the
various
parts
and
shrines
of
the
temple
and
it
describes
their
splendours
in
similes
drawn
from
the
heavens
and
the
earth
and
the
abyss
or
deep
beneath
the
earth
the
temple
itself
is
described
as
being
like
the
crescent
of
the
new
moon
or
like
the
sun
in
the
midst
of
the
stars
or
like
a
mountain
of
lapis
lazuli
or
like
a
mountain
of
shining
marble
parts
of
it
are
said
to
have
been
terrible
and
strong
as
a
savage
bull
or
a
lion
or
the
antelope
of
the
abyss
or
the
monster
lakhamu
who
dwells
in
the
abyss
or
the
sacred
leopard
that
inspires
terror
one
of
the
doors
of
the
temple
was
guarded
by
a
figure
of
the
hero
who
slew
the
monster
with
six
heads
and
at
another
door
was
a
good
dragon
and
at
another
a
lion
opposite
the
city
were
set
figures
of
the
seven
heroes
and
facing
the
rising
sun
was
fixed
the
emblem
of
the
figures
of
other
heroes
and
favourable
monsters
were
set
up
as
guardians
of
other
portions
of
the
temple
the
fastenings
of
the
main
entrance
were
decorated
with
dragons
shooting
out
their
tongues
and
the
bolt
of
the
great
door
was
fashioned
like
a
raging
hound
after
this
description
of
the
construction
and
adornment
of
the
temple
the
text
goes
on
to
narrate
how
gudea
arranged
for
its
material
endowment
he
stalled
oxen
and
sheep
for
sacrifice
and
feasting
in
the
outhouses
and
pens
within
the
temple
precincts
and
he
heaped
up
grain
in
its
granaries
its
storehouses
he
filled
with
spices
so
that
they
were
like
the
tigris
when
its
waters
are
in
flood
and
in
its
he
piled
up
precious
stones
and
silver
and
lead
in
abundance
within
the
temple
precincts
he
planted
a
sacred
garden
which
was
like
a
mountain
covered
with
vines
and
on
the
terrace
he
built
a
great
reservoir
or
tank
lined
with
lead
in
addition
to
the
great
stone
reservoir
within
the
temple
itself
he
constructed
a
special
for
the
sacred
doves
and
among
the
flowers
of
the
temple
garden
and
under
the
shade
of
the
great
trees
the
birds
of
heaven
flew
about
unmolested
the
first
of
the
two
great
cylinders
of
gudea
ends
at
this
point
in
the
description
of
the
temple
and
it
is
evident
that
its
text
was
composed
while
the
work
of
building
was
still
in
progress
moreover
the
writing
of
the
cylinder
was
finished
before
the
actual
work
of
building
the
temple
was
completed
for
the
last
column
of
the
text
concludes
with
a
prayer
to
ningirsu
to
make
it
glorious
during
the
progress
of
the
work
the
prayer
ending
with
the
words
ningirsu
glorify
it
glorify
the
temple
of
ningirsu
during
its
construction
the
text
of
the
second
of
the
two
great
cylinders
is
shorter
than
that
of
the
first
consisting
of
instead
of
thirty
columns
of
writing
and
it
was
composed
and
written
after
the
temple
was
completed
like
the
first
of
the
cylinders
it
concludes
with
a
prayer
to
ningirsu
on
behalf
of
the
temple
ending
with
the
similar
refrain
ningirsu
glorify
it
glorify
the
temple
of
ningirsu
after
its
construction
the
first
cylinder
as
we
have
seen
records
how
it
came
about
that
gudea
decided
to
rebuild
the
temple
in
honour
of
ningirsu
it
describes
how
when
the
land
was
suffering
from
drought
and
famine
gudea
had
a
dream
how
ninâ
interpreted
the
dream
to
mean
that
he
must
rebuild
the
temple
and
how
ningirsu
himself
promised
that
this
act
of
piety
would
restore
abundance
and
prosperity
to
the
land
its
text
ends
with
the
long
description
of
the
sumptuous
manner
in
which
the
patesi
carried
out
the
work
the
most
striking
points
of
which
we
have
just
summarized
the
narrative
of
the
second
cylinder
begins
at
the
moment
when
the
building
of
the
temple
was
finished
and
when
all
was
ready
for
the
great
god
to
be
installed
therein
and
its
text
is
taken
up
with
a
description
of
the
ceremonies
and
rites
with
which
this
solemn
function
was
carried
out
it
presents
us
with
a
picture
drawn
from
life
of
the
worship
and
cult
of
the
ancient
sumerians
in
actual
operation
in
view
of
its
importance
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
study
and
comparison
of
the
sumerian
and
babylonian
religious
systems
its
contents
also
may
be
summarized
we
will
afterwards
discuss
briefly
the
information
furnished
by
both
the
cylinders
on
the
sumerian
origin
of
many
of
the
religious
beliefs
and
practices
which
were
current
among
the
later
semitic
inhabitants
of
babylonia
and
assyria
when
gudea
had
finished
building
the
new
temple
of
and
had
completed
the
decoration
and
adornment
of
its
shrines
and
had
planted
its
gardens
and
stocked
its
and
storehouses
he
applied
himself
to
the
preliminary
ceremonies
and
religious
preparations
which
necessarily
preceded
the
actual
function
of
transferring
the
statue
of
the
god
ningirsu
from
his
old
temple
to
his
new
one
first
act
was
to
install
the
anunnaki
or
spirits
of
the
earth
in
the
new
temple
and
when
he
had
done
this
and
had
supplied
additional
sheep
for
their
sacrifices
and
food
in
abundance
for
their
offerings
he
prayed
to
them
to
give
him
their
assistance
and
to
pronounce
a
prayer
at
his
side
when
he
should
lead
ningirsu
into
his
new
the
text
then
describes
how
gudea
went
to
the
old
temple
of
ningirsu
accompanied
by
his
protecting
spirits
who
walked
before
him
and
behind
him
into
the
old
temple
he
carried
sumptuous
offerings
and
when
he
had
set
them
before
the
god
he
addressed
him
in
prayer
and
said
my
king
ningirsu
o
lord
who
curbest
the
raging
waters
o
lord
whose
word
surpasseth
all
others
o
son
of
enlil
o
warrior
what
commands
shall
i
faithfully
carry
out
o
ningirsu
i
have
built
thy
temple
and
with
joy
would
i
lead
thee
therein
and
my
goddess
bau
would
install
at
thy
we
are
told
that
the
god
accepted
prayer
and
thereby
he
gave
his
consent
to
be
removed
from
the
old
temple
of
to
his
new
one
which
bore
the
same
name
but
the
ceremony
of
the
removal
was
not
carried
out
at
once
for
the
due
time
had
not
arrived
the
year
ended
and
the
new
year
came
and
then
month
of
the
began
the
third
day
of
the
month
was
that
appointed
for
the
installation
of
ningirsu
gudea
meanwhile
had
sprinkled
the
ground
with
oil
and
set
out
offerings
of
honey
and
butter
and
wine
and
grain
mixed
with
milk
and
dates
and
food
untouched
by
fire
to
serve
as
food
for
the
gods
and
the
gods
themselves
had
assisted
in
the
preparations
for
the
reception
of
ningirsu
the
god
asaru
made
ready
the
temple
itself
and
ninmada
performed
the
ceremony
of
purification
the
god
enki
issued
oracles
and
the
god
nindub
the
supreme
priest
of
eridu
brought
incense
ninâ
performed
chants
within
the
temple
and
brought
black
sheep
and
holy
cows
to
its
folds
and
stalls
this
record
of
the
help
given
by
the
other
gods
we
may
interpret
as
meaning
that
the
priests
attached
to
the
other
great
sumerian
temples
took
part
in
the
preparation
of
the
new
temple
and
added
their
offerings
to
the
temple
stores
to
many
of
the
gods
also
special
shrines
within
the
temple
were
assigned
when
the
purification
of
was
completed
and
the
way
between
the
old
temple
and
the
new
made
ready
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
prostrated
themselves
on
the
ground
city
says
gudea
like
the
mother
of
a
sick
man
who
prepareth
a
potion
for
him
or
like
the
cattle
of
the
plain
which
lie
down
together
or
like
the
fierce
lion
the
master
of
the
plain
when
he
during
the
day
and
the
night
before
the
ceremony
of
removal
prayers
and
supplications
were
uttered
and
at
the
first
light
of
dawn
on
the
appointed
day
the
god
ningirsu
went
into
his
new
temple
a
whirlwind
the
goddess
bau
entering
at
his
side
the
sun
rising
over
she
entered
beside
his
couch
like
a
faithful
wife
whose
cares
are
for
her
own
household
and
she
dwelt
beside
his
ear
and
bestowed
abundance
upon
shirpurla
as
the
day
began
to
brighten
and
the
sun
rose
gudea
set
out
as
offerings
in
the
temple
a
fat
ox
and
a
fat
sheep
and
he
brought
a
vase
of
lead
and
filled
it
with
wine
which
he
poured
out
as
a
libation
and
he
performed
incantations
then
having
duly
established
ningirsu
and
bau
in
the
chief
shrine
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
lesser
gods
and
installed
them
in
their
appointed
places
in
the
temple
where
they
would
be
always
ready
to
assist
ningirsu
in
the
temple
ceremonies
and
in
the
issue
of
his
decrees
for
the
welfare
of
the
city
and
its
inhabitants
thus
he
established
the
god
galalim
the
son
of
ningirsu
in
a
chosen
spot
in
the
great
court
in
front
of
the
temple

was
his
privilege
to
raise
on
high
a
made
of
cedar
all
these
lesser
deities
having
close
relations
to
the
god
ningirsu
were
installed
by
gudea
in
his
temple
in
close
proximity
to
him
that
they
might
be
always
ready
to
perform
their
special
functions
but
the
greater
deities
also
had
their
share
in
the
inauguration
of
the
temple
and
of
these
gudea
specially
mentions
ana
enlil
ninkharsag
enki
and
enzu
who
all
assisted
in
rendering
the
lot
propitious
for
at
least
three
of
the
greater
gods
ana
enlil
and
the
goddess
gudea
erected
shrines
near
one
another
and
probably
within
the
precincts
and
as
the
passage
which
records
this
fact
is
broken
it
is
possible
that
the
missing
portion
of
the
text
recorded
the
building
of
shrines
to
other
deities
in
any
case
it
is
clear
that
the
composer
of
the
text
represents
all
the
great
gods
as
beholding
the
erection
and
inauguration
of
new
temple
with
favour
after
the
account
of
the
installation
of
ningirsu
and
his
spouse
bau
and
his
attendant
deities
the
text
records
the
sumptuous
offerings
which
gudea
placed
within
shrine
these
included
another
chariot
drawn
by
an
ass
a
a
sword
with
nine
emblems
a
bow
with
terrible
arrows
and
a
quiver
decorated
with
wild
beasts
and
dragons
shooting
out
their
tongues
and
a
bed
which
was
set
within
the
on
the
couch
in
the
shrine
the
goddess
bau
reclined
beside
her
lord
ningirsu
and
ate
of
the
great
victims
which
were
sacrificed
in
their
honour
when
the
ceremony
of
installation
had
been
successfully
performed
gudea
rested
and
for
seven
days
he
feasted
with
his
people
during
this
time
the
maid
was
the
equal
of
her
mistress
and

and

and
the
humble

and
in
place
of
evil
speech
only
propitious
words
were
heard
the
rich

did
not
wrong
the
orphan
and
the
strong
man
did
not
oppress
the
widow
the
laws
of
ninâ
and
ningirsu
were
observed
justice
was
bright
in
the
sunlight
and
the
trampled
iniquity
under
foot
the
building
of
the
temple
also
restored
material
prosperity
to
the
land
for
the
canals
became
full
of
water
and
fish
swarmed
in
the
pools
the
granaries
were
filled
with
grain
and
the
flocks
and
herds
brought
forth
their
increase
the
city
of
shirpurla
was
satiated
with
abundance
such
is
a
summary
of
the
account
which
gudea
has
left
us
of
his
rebuilding
of
the
temple
of
the
reasons
which
led
him
to
undertake
the
work
and
of
the
results
which
followed
its
completion
it
has
often
been
said
that
the
inscriptions
of
the
ancient
sumerians
are
without
much
intrinsic
value
that
they
mainly
consist
of
dull
votive
formulæ
and
that
for
general
interest
the
best
of
them
can
not
be
compared
with
the
later
inscriptions
of
the
semitic
inhabitants
of
mesopotamia
this
reproach
for
which
until
recently
there
was
considerable
justification
has
been
finally
removed
by
the
working
out
of
the
texts
upon
cylinders
for
picturesque
narrative
for
wealth
of
detail
and
for
striking
similes
it
would
be
hard
to
find
their
superior
in
babylonian
and
assyrian
literature
they
are
in
fact
very
remarkable
compositions
and
in
themselves
justify
the
claim
that
the
sumerians
were
possessed
of
a
literature
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
term
but
that
is
not
their
only
value
for
they
give
a
vivid
picture
of
ancient
sumerian
life
and
of
the
ideals
and
aims
which
actuated
the
people
and
their
rulers
the
sumerians
were
essentially
an
unmilitary
race
that
they
could
maintain
a
stubborn
fight
for
their
territory
is
proved
by
the
prolonged
struggle
maintained
by
shirpurla
against
her
rival
gishkhu
but
neither
ruler
nor
people
was
inflamed
by
love
of
conquest
for
its
own
sake
they
were
settled
in
a
rich
and
fertile
country
which
supplied
their
own
wants
in
abundance
and
they
were
content
to
lead
a
peaceful
life
therein
engaged
in
agricultural
and
industrial
pursuits
and
devoted
wholly
to
the
worship
of
their
gods
inscriptions
enable
us
to
realize
with
what
fervour
they
carried
out
the
rebuilding
of
a
temple
and
how
the
whole
resources
of
the
nation
were
devoted
to
the
successful
completion
of
the
work
it
is
true
that
the
rebuilding
of
was
undertaken
in
a
critical
period
when
the
land
was
threatened
with
famine
and
the
peculiar
magnificence
with
which
the
work
was
carried
out
may
be
partly
explained
as
due
to
the
belief
that
such
devotion
would
ensure
a
return
of
material
prosperity
but
the
existence
of
such
a
belief
is
in
itself
an
index
to
the
character
and
we
may
take
it
that
the
record
faithfully
represents
the
relations
of
the
sumerians
to
their
gods
and
the
important
place
which
worship
and
ritual
occupied
in
the
national
life
moreover
the
inscriptions
of
gudea
furnish
much
valuable
information
with
regard
to
the
details
of
sumerian
worship
and
the
elaborate
organization
of
the
temples
from
them
we
can
reconstruct
a
picture
of
one
of
these
immense
buildings
with
its
numerous
shrines
and
courts
surrounded
by
sacred
gardens
and
raising
its
ziggurat
or
temple
tower
high
above
the
surrounding
city
within
its
dark
chambers
were
the
mysterious
figures
of
the
gods
and
what
little
light
could
enter
would
have
been
reflected
in
the
tanks
of
sacred
water
sunk
to
the
level
of
the
pavement
the
air
within
the
shrines
must
have
been
heavy
with
the
smell
of
incense
and
of
aromatic
woods
while
the
deep
silence
would
have
been
broken
only
by
the
chanting
of
the
priests
and
the
feet
of
those
that
bore
offerings
outside
in
the
sunlight
cedars
and
other
rare
trees
cast
a
pleasant
shade
and
birds
flew
about
among
the
flowers
and
bushes
in
the
outer
courts
and
on
the
garden
terraces
the
area
covered
by
the
temple
buildings
must
have
been
enormous
for
they
included
the
dwellings
of
the
priests
stables
and
pens
for
the
cattle
sheep
and
kids
employed
for
sacrifice
and
and
storehouses
and
granaries
for
the
produce
from
the
temple
lands
we
also
get
much
information
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
offerings
and
the
character
of
the
ceremonies
which
were
performed
we
may
mention
as
of
peculiar
interest
symbolical
rite
which
preceded
the
making
of
the
bricks
and
the
ceremony
of
the
installation
of
ningirsu
in
the
presence
of
the
prostrate
city
the
texts
also
throw
an
interesting
light
on
the
truly
oriental
manner
in
which
when
approaching
one
deity
for
help
the
cooperation
and
assistance
of
other
deities
were
first
secured
thus
gudea
solicited
the
intercession
of
ningirsu
and
gatumdug
before
applying
to
the
goddess
ninâ
to
interpret
his
dream
the
extremely
human
character
of
the
gods
themselves
is
also
well
illustrated
thus
we
gather
from
the
texts
that
temple
was
arranged
like
the
palace
of
a
sumerian
ruler
and
that
he
was
surrounded
by
gods
who
took
the
place
of
the
attendants
and
ministers
of
his
human
counterpart
his
son
was
installed
in
a
place
of
honour
and
shared
with
him
the
responsibility
of
government
another
god
was
his
personal
attendant
and
cupbearer
who
offered
him
fair
water
and
looked
after
the
ablutions
two
more
were
his
generals
who
secured
his
country
against
the
attacks
of
foes
another
was
his
counsellor
who
received
and
presented
petitions
from
his
subjects
and
superintended
his
journeys
another
was
the
head
of
his
harîm
a
position
of
great
trust
and
responsibility
while
a
keeper
of
the
harîm
looked
after
the
practical
details
another
god
was
the
driver
of
his
chariot
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
chariot
was
drawn
by
an
ass
for
horses
were
not
introduced
into
western
asia
until
a
much
later
period
other
gods
performed
the
functions
of
head
shepherd
chief
musician
chief
singer
head
cultivator
and
inspector
of
irrigation
inspector
of
the
fishing
land
steward
and
architect
his
household
also
included
his
wife
and
his
seven
virgin
daughters
in
addition
to
the
account
of
the
various
functions
performed
by
these
lesser
deities
the
texts
also
furnish
valuable
facts
with
regard
to
the
characters
and
attributes
of
the
greater
gods
and
goddesses
such
as
the
attributes
of
ningirsu
himself
and
the
character
of
ninâ
as
the
goddess
who
divined
and
interpreted
the
secrets
of
the
gods
but
perhaps
the
most
interesting
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
the
texts
relate
to
the
influence
exerted
by
the
ancient
sumerians
upon
semitic
beliefs
and
practices
it
has
of
course
long
been
recognized
that
the
later
semitic
inhabitants
of
babylonia
and
assyria
drew
most
of
their
culture
from
the
sumerians
whom
they
displaced
and
absorbed
their
system
of
writing
the
general
structure
of
their
temples
the
ritual
of
their
worship
the
majority
of
their
religious
compositions
and
many
of
their
gods
themselves
are
to
be
traced
to
a
sumerian
origin
and
much
of
the
information
obtained
from
the
cylinders
of
gudea
merely
confirms
or
illustrates
the
conclusions
already
deduced
from
other
sources
as
instances
we
may
mention
the
belief
in
spirits
which
is
illustrated
by
the
importance
attached
to
the
placating
of
the
anunnaki
or
spirits
of
the
earth
to
whom
a
special
place
and
special
offerings
were
assigned
in
the
sumerian
origin
of
ceremonies
of
purification
is
confirmed
by
purification
of
the
city
before
beginning
the
building
of
the
temple
and
again
before
the
transference
of
the
god
from
his
old
temple
to
the
new
one
the
consultation
of
omens
which
was
so
marked
a
feature
of
babylonian
and
assyrian
life
is
seen
in
actual
operation
under
the
sumerians
for
even
after
gudea
had
received
direct
instructions
from
ningirsu
to
begin
building
his
temple
he
did
not
proceed
to
carry
them
out
until
he
had
consulted
the
omens
and
found
that
they
were
favourable
moreover
the
references
to
mythological
beings
such
as
the
seven
heroes
the
dragon
of
the
deep
and
the
god
who
slew
the
dragon
confirm
the
opinion
that
the
creation
legends
and
other
mythological
compositions
of
the
babylonians
were
derived
by
them
from
sumerian
sources
but
there
are
two
incidents
in
the
narrative
which
are
on
a
rather
different
plane
and
are
more
startling
in
their
novelty
one
is
the
story
of
dream
and
the
other
the
sign
which
he
sought
from
his
god
the
former
is
distinctly
apocalyptic
in
character
and
both
may
be
parallelled
in
what
is
regarded
as
purely
semitic
literature
that
such
conceptions
existed
among
the
sumerians
is
a
most
interesting
fact
and
although
the
theory
of
independent
origin
is
possible
their
existence
may
well
have
influenced
later
semitic
beliefs
chapter
v
elam
and
babylon
the
country
of
the
sea
and
the
kassites
up
to
five
years
ago
our
knowledge
of
elam
and
of
the
part
she
played
in
the
ancient
world
was
derived
in
the
main
from
a
few
allusions
to
the
country
to
be
found
in
the
records
of
babylonian
and
assyrian
kings
it
is
true
that
a
few
inscriptions
of
the
native
rulers
had
been
found
in
persia
but
they
belonged
to
the
late
periods
of
her
history
and
the
majority
consisted
of
short
dedicatory
formulae
and
did
not
supply
us
with
much
historical
information
but
the
excavations
carried
on
since
then
by
de
morgan
at
susa
have
revealed
an
entirely
new
chapter
of
ancient
oriental
history
and
have
thrown
a
flood
of
light
upon
the
position
occupied
by
elam
among
the
early
races
of
the
east
lying
to
the
north
of
the
persian
gulf
and
to
the
east
of
the
tigris
and
rising
from
the
broad
plains
nearer
the
coast
to
the
mountainous
districts
within
its
borders
on
the
east
and
north
elam
was
one
of
the
nearest
neighbours
of
chaldæa
a
few
facts
concerning
her
relations
with
babylonia
during
certain
periods
of
her
history
have
long
been
known
and
her
struggles
with
the
later
kings
of
assyria
are
known
in
some
detail
but
for
her
history
during
the
earliest
periods
we
have
had
to
trust
mainly
to
conjecture
that
in
the
earlier
as
in
the
later
periods
she
should
have
been
in
constant
antagonism
with
babylonia
might
legitimately
be
suspected
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
should
find
an
echo
of
her
early
struggles
with
chaldæa
in
the
legends
which
were
current
in
the
later
periods
of
babylonian
history
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
tablets
or
sections
of
the
great
babylonian
epic
which
describes
the
exploits
of
the
babylonian
hero
gilgamesh
a
story
is
told
of
an
expedition
undertaken
by
gilgamesh
and
his
friend
against
an
elamite
despot
named
it
is
related
in
the
poem
that
khumbaba
was
feared
by
all
who
dwelt
near
him
for
his
roaring
was
like
the
storm
and
any
man
perished
who
was
rash
enough
to
enter
the
in
which
he
dwelt
but
gilgamesh
encouraged
by
a
dream
sent
him
by
the
pressed
on
with
his
friend
and
having
entered
the
wood
succeeded
in
slaying
khumbaba
and
in
cutting
off
his
head
this
legend
is
doubtless
based
on
episodes
in
early
babylonian
and
elamite
history
khumbaba
may
not
have
been
an
actual
historical
ruler
but
at
least
he
represents
or
personifies
the
power
of
elam
and
the
success
of
gilgamesh
no
doubt
reflects
the
aspirations
with
which
many
a
babylonian
expedition
set
out
for
the
elamite
frontier
incidentally
it
may
be
noted
that
the
legend
possibly
had
a
still
closer
historical
parallel
for
the
name
of
khumbaba
occurs
as
a
component
in
a
proper
name
upon
one
of
the
elamite
contracts
found
recently
by
de
morgan
at
the
name
in
question
is
written
the
servant
of
god
and
it
proves
that
at
the
date
at
which
the
contract
was
written
about
the
name
of
khumbaba
was
still
held
in
remembrance
possibly
as
that
of
an
early
historical
ruler
of
the
country
in
her
struggles
with
chaldæa
elam
was
not
successful
during
the
earliest
historical
period
of
which
we
have
obtained
information
and
so
far
as
we
can
tell
at
present
her
princes
long
continued
to
own
allegiance
to
the
semitic
rulers
whose
influence
was
predominant
from
time
to
time
in
the
plains
of
lower
mesopotamia
tradition
relates
that
two
of
the
earliest
semitic
rulers
whose
names
are
known
to
us
sargon
and
kings
of
agade
held
sway
in
elam
for
in
the
which
were
current
in
a
later
period
concerning
them
the
former
is
credited
with
the
conquest
of
the
whole
country
while
of
the
latter
it
is
related
that
he
conquered
apirak
an
elamite
district
and
captured
its
king
some
doubts
were
formerly
cast
upon
these
traditions
inasmuch
as
they
were
found
in
a
text
containing
omens
or
forecasts
but
these
doubts
were
removed
by
the
discovery
of
contemporary
documents
by
which
the
later
traditions
were
confirmed
conquest
of
elam
for
instance
was
proved
to
be
historical
by
a
reference
to
the
event
in
a
upon
tablets
belonging
to
his
reign
moreover
the
event
has
received
further
confirmation
from
an
unpublished
tablet
in
the
british
museum
containing
a
copy
of
the
original
chronicle
from
which
the
historical
extracts
in
the
were
derived
the
portion
of
the
composition
inscribed
upon
this
tablet
does
not
contain
the
lines
referring
to
conquest
of
elam
for
these
occurred
in
an
earlier
section
of
the
composition
but
the
recovery
of
the
tablet
puts
beyond
a
doubt
the
historical
character
of
the
traditions
preserved
upon
the
as
a
whole
and
the
conquest
of
elam
is
thus
confirmed
by
inference
the
new
text
does
recount
the
expedition
undertaken
by
the
son
of
sargon
against
apirak
and
so
furnishes
a
direct
confirmation
of
this
event
another
early
conqueror
of
elam
who
was
probably
of
semitic
origin
was
king
of
the
city
of
kish
for
from
a
number
of
his
inscriptions
found
near
those
of
sargon
at
nippur
in
babylonia
we
learn
that
he
subdued
elam
and
the
district
in
which
the
city
of
susa
was
probably
situated
from
a
small
preserved
in
the

we
know
of
another
conquest
of
elam
by
a
semitic
ruler
of
this
early
period
the
was
made
and
engraved
by
the
orders
of
mutabil
an
early
governor
of
the
city
of
to
commemorate
his
own
valour
as
the
man
smote
the
head
of
the
of
elam
mutabil
was
not
himself
an
independent
ruler
and
his
conquest
of
elam
must
have
been
undertaken
on
behalf
of
the
suzerain
to
whom
he
owed
allegiance
and
thus
his
victory
can
not
be
classed
in
the
same
category
as
those
of
his
predecessors
a
similar
remark
applies
to
the
success
against
the
city
of
anshan
in
elam
achieved
by
grudea
the
sumerian
ruler
of
shirpurla
inasmuch
as
he
was
a
patesi
or
viceroy
and
not
an
independent
king
of
greater
duration
was
the
influence
exercised
over
elam
by
the
kings
of
ur
for
bricks
and
have
been
found
at
susa
proving
that
dungi
one
of
the
most
powerful
kings
of
ur
and
and
kings
of
the
second
dynasty
in
that
city
all
in
turn
included
elam
within
the
limits
of
their
empire
such
are
the
main
facts
which
until
recently
had
been
ascertained
with
regard
to
the
influence
of
early
babylonian
rulers
in
elam
the
information
is
obtained
mainly
from
babylonian
sources
and
until
recently
we
have
been
unable
to
fill
in
any
details
of
the
picture
from
the
elamite
side
but
this
inability
has
now
been
removed
by
de
discoveries
from
the
inscribed
bricks
cones
stelæ
and
statues
that
have
been
brought
to
light
in
the
course
of
his
excavations
at
susa
we
have
recovered
the
name
of
a
succession
of
native
elamite
rulers
all
those
who
are
to
be
assigned
to
this
early
period
during
which
elam
owed
allegiance
to
the
kings
of
babylonia
ascribe
to
themselves
the
title
of
or
viceroy
of
susa
in
acknowledgment
of
their
dependence
their
records
consist
principally
of
building
inscriptions
and
foundation
memorials
and
they
commemorate
the
construction
or
repair
of
temples
the
cutting
of
canals
and
the
like
they
do
not
therefore
throw
much
light
upon
the
problems
connected
with
the
external
history
of
elam
during
this
early
period
but
we
obtain
from
them
a
glimpse
of
the
internal
administration
of
the
country
we
see
a
nation
without
ambition
to
extend
its
boundaries
and
content
at
any
rate
for
the
time
to
owe
allegiance
to
foreign
rulers
while
the
energies
of
its
native
princes
are
devoted
exclusively
to
the
cultivation
of
the
worship
of
the
gods
and
to
the
amelioration
of
the
conditions
of
the
life
of
the
people
in
their
charge
a
difficult
but
interesting
problem
presents
itself
for
solution
at
the
outset
of
our
inquiry
into
the
history
of
this
people
as
revealed
by
their
lately
recovered
inscriptions
the
problem
of
their
race
and
origin
found
at
susa
in
elam
and
inscribed
by
princes
bearing
purely
elamite
names
we
should
expect
these
votive
and
memorial
texts
to
be
written
entirely
in
the
elamite
language
but
such
is
not
the
case
for
many
of
them
are
written
in
good
semitic
babylonian
while
some
are
entirely
composed
in
the
tongue
which
we
term
elamite
or
anzanite
others
so
far
as
their
language
and
style
is
concerned
might
have
been
written
by
any
early
semitic
king
ruling
in
babylonia
why
did
early
princes
of
susa
make
this
use
of
the
babylonian
tongue
at
first
sight
it
might
seem
possible
to
trace
a
parallel
in
the
use
of
the
babylonian
language
by
kings
and
officials
in
egypt
and
syria
during
the
fifteenth
century
as
revealed
in
the
letters
from
tell
but
a
thought
will
show
that
the
cases
are
not
similar
the
egyptian
or
syrian
scribe
employed
babylonian
as
a
medium
for
his
official
foreign
correspondence
because
babylonian
at
that
period
was
the
of
the
east
but
the
object
of
the
early
elamite
rulers
was
totally
different
their
inscribed
bricks
and
memorial
stelæ
were
not
intended
for
the
eyes
of
foreigners
but
for
those
of
their
own
descendants
built
into
the
structure
of
a
temple
or
buried
beneath
the
edifice
one
of
their
principal
objects
was
to
preserve
the
name
and
deeds
of
the
writer
from
oblivion
like
similar
documents
found
on
the
sites
of
assyrian
and
babylonian
cities
they
sometimes
include
curses
upon
any
impious
man
who
on
finding
the
inscription
after
the
temple
shall
have
fallen
into
ruins
should
in
any
way
injure
the
inscription
or
deface
the
name
it
will
be
obvious
that
the
writers
of
these
inscriptions
intended
that
they
should
be
intelligible
to
those
who
might
come
across
them
in
the
future
if
therefore
they
employed
the
babylonian
as
well
as
the
elamite
language
it
is
clear
that
they
expected
that
their
future
readers
might
be
either
babylonian
or
elamite
and
this
belief
can
only
be
explained
on
the
supposition
that
their
own
subjects
were
of
mixed
race
it
is
therefore
certain
that
at
this
early
period
of
elamite
history
semitic
babylonians
and
elamites
dwelt
side
by
side
in
susa
and
retained
their
separate
languages
the
problem
therefore
resolves
itself
into
the
inquiry
which
of
these
two
peoples
occupied
the
country
first
were
the
semites
at
first
in
sole
possession
which
was
afterwards
disputed
by
the
incursion
of
elamite
tribes
from
the
north
and
east
or
were
the
elamites
the
original
inhabitants
of
the
land
into
which
the
semites
subsequently
pressed
from
babylonia
a
similar
mixture
of
races
is
met
with
in
babylonia
itself
in
the
early
period
of
the
history
of
that
country
there
the
early
sumerian
inhabitants
were
gradually
dispossessed
by
the
invading
semite
who
adopted
the
civilization
of
the
conquered
race
and
took
over
the
system
of
cuneiform
writing
which
he
modified
to
suit
his
own
language
in
babylonia
the
semites
eventually
predominated
and
the
sumerians
as
a
race
disappeared
but
during
the
process
of
absorption
the
two
languages
were
employed
indiscriminately
the
kings
of
the
first
babylonian
dynasty
wrote
their
votive
inscriptions
sometimes
in
sumerian
sometimes
in
semitic
babylonian
at
other
times
they
employed
both
languages
for
the
same
text
writing
the
record
first
in
sumerian
and
afterwards
appending
a
semitic
translation
by
the
side
and
in
the
legal
and
commercial
documents
of
the
period
the
old
sumerian
legal
forms
and
phrases
were
retained
intact
in
elam
we
may
suppose
that
the
use
of
the
sumerian
and
semitic
languages
was
the
same
it
may
be
surmised
however
that
the
first
semitic
incursions
into
elam
took
place
at
a
much
later
period
than
those
into
babylonia
and
under
very
different
conditions
when
overrunning
the
plains
and
cities
of
the
sumerians
the
semites
were
comparatively
uncivilized
and
so
far
as
we
know
without
a
system
of
writing
of
their
own
the
incursions
into
elam
must
have
taken
place
under
the
great
semitic
conquerors
such
as
and
and
at
this
period
they
had
fully
adopted
and
modified
the
sumerian
characters
to
express
their
own
semitic
tongue
and
on
their
invasion
of
elam
they
brought
their
system
of
writing
with
them
the
native
princes
of
elam
whom
they
conquered
adopted
it
in
turn
for
many
of
their
votive
texts
and
inscribed
monuments
when
they
wished
to
write
them
in
the
babylonian
language
such
is
the
most
probable
explanation
of
the
occurrence
in
elam
of
inscriptions
in
the
old
babylonian
language
written
by
native
princes
concerning
purely
domestic
matters
but
a
further
question
now
suggests
itself
assuming
that
this
was
the
order
in
which
events
took
place
are
we
to
suppose
that
the
first
semitic
invaders
of
elam
found
there
a
native
population
in
a
totally
undeveloped
stage
of
civilization
or
did
they
find
a
population
enjoying
a
comparatively
high
state
of
culture
different
from
their
own
which
they
proceeded
to
modify
and
transform
luckily
we
have
not
to
fall
back
on
conjecture
for
an
answer
to
these
questions
for
a
recent
discovery
at
susa
has
furnished
material
from
which
it
is
possible
to
reconstruct
in
outline
the
state
of
culture
of
these
early
elamites
this
interesting
discovery
consists
of
a
number
of
clay
tablets
inscribed
in
the
system
of
writing
a
system
which
was
probably
the
only
one
in
use
in
the
country
during
the
period
before
the
semitic
invasion
the
documents
in
question
are
small
roughly
formed
tablets
of
clay
very
similar
to
those
employed
in
the
early
periods
of
babylonian
history
but
the
signs
and
characters
impressed
upon
them
offer
the
greatest
contrast
to
the
sumerian
and
early
babylonian
characters
with
which
we
are
familiar
although
they
can
not
be
fully
deciphered
at
present
it
is
probable
that
they
are
tablets
of
accounts
the
signs
upon
them
consisting
of
lists
of
figures
and
what
are
probably
ideographs
for
things
some
of
the
ideographs
such
as
that
for
with
which
many
of
the
texts
begin
are
very
similar
to
the
sumerian
or
babylonian
signs
for
the
same
objects
but
the
majority
are
entirely
different
and
have
been
formed
and
developed
upon
a
system
of
their
own
illustration

in

the

on
these
tablets
in
fact
we
have
a
new
class
of
cuneiform
writing
in
an
early
stage
of
its
development
when
the
hieroglyphic
or
pictorial
character
of
the
ideographs
was
still
prominent

although
the
meaning
of
the
majority
of
these
ideographs
has
not
yet
been
identified
père
scheil
who
has
edited
the
texts
has
succeeded
in
making
out
the
system
of
numeration
he
has
identified
the
signs
for
unity
and
and
for
certain
fractions
and
the
signs
for
these
figures
are
quite
different
from
those
employed
by
the
sumerians
illustration
fractions
the
system
too
is
different
for
it
is
a
decimal
and
not
a
sexagesimal
system
of
numeration
that
in
its
origin
this
form
of
writing
had
some
connection
with
that
employed
and
so
far
as
we
know
invented
by
the
ancient
sumerians
is
possible
but
it
shows
small
trace
of
sumerian
influence
and
the
disparity
in
the
two
systems
of
numeration
is
a
clear
indication
that
at
any
rate
it
broke
off
and
was
isolated
from
the
latter
at
a
very
early
period
having
once
been
adopted
by
the
early
elamites
it
continued
to
be
used
by
them
for
long
periods
with
but
small
change
or
modification
employed
far
from
the
centre
of
sumerian
civilization
its
development
was
slow
and
it
seems
to
have
remained
in
its
ideographic
state
while
the
system
employed
by
the
sumerians
and
adopted
by
the
semitic
babylonians
was
developed
along
syllabic
lines
it
is
of
course
also
possible
that
the
system
of
writing
had
no
connection
in
its
origin
with
that
of
the
sumerians
and
was
invented
independently
of
the
system
employed
in
babylonia
in
that
case
the
signs
which
resemble
certain
of
the
sumerian
characters
must
have
been
adopted
in
a
later
stage
of
its
development
though
it
would
be
rash
to
dogmatize
on
the
subject
the
view
that
connects
its
origin
with
the
sumerians
appears
on
the
whole
to
fit
in
best
with
the
evidence
at
present
available
it
was
without
doubt
this
system
of
writing
which
the
semites
from
babylonia
found
employed
in
elam
on
their
first
incursions
into
that
country
they
brought
with
them
their
own
more
convenient
form
of
writing
and
when
the
country
had
once
been
finally
subdued
the
subject
elamite
princes
adopted
the
foreign
system
of
writing
and
language
from
their
conquerors
for
memorial
and
monumental
inscriptions
but
the
ancient
native
writing
was
not
entirely
ousted
and
continued
to
be
employed
by
the
common
people
of
elam
for
the
ordinary
purposes
of
daily
life
that
this
was
the
case
at
least
until
the
reign
of
one
of
the
early
subject
native
rulers
is
clear
from
one
of
his
inscriptions
engraved
upon
a
block
of
limestone
to
commemorate
the
dedication
of
what
were
probably
some
temple
furnishings
in
honour
of
the
god

the

part
of
the

is
written
in

is
an
addition

enumerating
the
offerings
which
the
decreed

the
future
in
honour
of
the
god
in
course
of
time
this
system
of
writing
by
means
of
ideographs
seems
to
have
died
out
and
a
modified
form
of
the
babylonian
system
was
adopted
by
the
elamites
for
writing
their
own
language
phonetically
it
is
in
this
phonetic
character
that
the

of
the
later
elamite

composed

assumed
that

were
the
work

it

also
possible
that

added

of
the
earlier
of

of

probably
reigned
at

not
later
than
he
styles
himself

of

we
do
not
know
at

what
contemporary
king
in
babylonia

owed
allegiance

of
his
inscriptions
that
have
been
recovered

engraved
upon
a
stele
of
limestone
and
records
the
building
of
the
gate
of
shushinak
at
susa
and
the
cutting
of
a
canal
it
also
recounts
the
offerings
which
dedicated
on
the
completion
of
the
work
it
may
here
be
quoted
as
an
example
of
the
class
of
votive
inscriptions
from
which
the
names
of
these
early
elamite
rulers
have
been
recovered
the
inscription
runs
as
follows
the
god
shushinak
his
lord
the
son
of
patesi
of
susa
governor
of
the
land
of
elam
when
he
set
the
door
of
his
gate
in
place
in
the
gate
of
the
god
shushinak
his
lord
and
when
he
had
opened
the
canal
of
sidur
he
set
up
in
face
thereof
his
canopy
and
he
set
planks
of
for
its
gate
a
sheep
in
the
interior
thereof
and
sheep
without
he
appointed
for
sacrifice
to
him
each
day
on
days
of
festival
he
caused
the
people
to
sing
songs
in
the
gate
of
the
god
shushinak
and
twenty
measures
of
fine
oil
he
dedicated
to
make
his
gate
beautiful
four
of
silver
he
dedicated
a
censer
of
silver
and
gold
he
dedicated
for
a
sweet
odour
a
sword
he
dedicated
an
axe
with
four
blades
he
dedicated
and
he
dedicated
silver
in
addition
for
the
mounting
thereof
a
righteous
judgment
he
judged
in
the
city
as
for
the
man
who
shall
transgress
his
judgment
or
shall
remove
his
gift

the
gods
shushinak
and
shamash

ninni
and

and

may
all
the
gods
uproot
his
foundation
and
his
seed
may
they
destroy
it
will
be
seen
that
takes
a
delight
in
enumerating
the
details
of
the
offerings
he
has
ordained
in
honour
of
his
shushinak
and
this
religious
temper
is
peculiarly
characteristic
of
the
princes
of
elam
throughout
the
whole
course
of
their
history
another
interesting
point
to
notice
in
the
inscription
is
that
although
the
writer
invokes
shushinak
his
own
god
and
puts
his
name
at
the
head
of
the
list
of
deities
whose
vengeance
he
implores
upon
the
impious
he
also
calls
upon
the
gods
of
the
babylonians
as
he
wrote
the
inscription
itself
in
babylonian
in
the
belief
that
it
might
be
recovered
by
some
future
semitic
inhabitant
of
his
country
so
he
included
in
his
imprecations
those
deities
whose
names
he
conceived
would
be
most
reverenced
by
such
a
reader
in
addition
to
the
names
of
a
number
of
other
patesis
or
viceroys
have
recently
been
recovered
such
as
and
idadu
i
and
his
son
and
his
grandson
idadu
ii
all
these
probably
ruled
after
and
may
be
set
in
the
early
period
of
babylonian
supremacy
in
elam
it
has
been
stated
above
that
the
allegiance
which
these
early
elamite
princes
owed
to
their
overlords
in
babylonia
was
probably
reflected
in
the
titles
which
they
bear
upon
their
inscriptions
recently
found
at
susa
these
titles
are
of
susa
of
elam
which
may
be
rendered
as
of
susa
governor
of
but
inscriptions
have
been
found
on
the
same
site
belonging
to
another
series
of
rulers
to
whom
a
different
title
is
applied
instead
of
referring
to
themselves
as
viceroys
of
susa
and
governors
of
elam
they
bear
the
title
of
of
elam
of
siparki
and
of
susa
siparki
or
sipar
was
probably
the
name
of
an
important
section
of
elamite
territory
and
the
title
probably
carries
with
it
an
idea
of
independence
of
foreign
control
which
is
absent
from
the
title
of
it
is
therefore
legitimate
to
trace
this
change
of
title
to
a
corresponding
change
in
the
political
condition
of
elam
and
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
the
view
that
the
rulers
of
elam
who
bore
the
title
of
reigned
at
a
period
when
elam
herself
was
independent
and
may
possibly
have
exercised
a
suzerainty
over
the
neighbouring
districts
of
babylonia
the
worker
of
this
change
in
the
political
condition
of
elam
and
the
author
of
her
independence
was
a
king
named
or
whose
name
and
deeds
have
been
preserved
in
later
assyrian
records
where
he
is
termed
and
this
ruler
according
to
the
assyrian
king
was
not
content
with
throwing
off
the
yoke
under
which
his
land
had
laboured
for
so
long
but
carried
war
into
the
country
of
his
suzerain
and
marched
through
babylonia
devastating
and
despoiling
the
principal
cities
this
successful
elamite
campaign
took
place
according
to
the
computation
of
the
later
assyrian
scribes
about
the
year
c
and
it
is
probable
that
for
many
years
afterwards
the
authority
of
the
king
of
elam
extended
over
the
plains
of
babylonia
it
has
been
suggested
that
after
including
babylonia
within
his
empire
did
not
remain
permanently
in
elam
but
may
have
resided
for
a
part
of
each
year
at
least
in
lower
mesopotamia
his
object
no
doubt
would
have
been
to
superintend
in
person
the
administration
of
his
empire
and
to
check
any
growing
spirit
of
independence
among
his
local
governors
he
may
thus
have
appointed
in
susa
itself
a
local
governor
who
would
carry
on
the
business
of
the
country
during
his
absence
and
under
the
king
himself
would
wield
supreme
authority
such
governors
may
have
been
the
sukkali
who
unlike
the
patesi
were
independent
of
foreign
control
but
yet
did
not
enjoy
the
full
title
of
for
references
to
the
passages
where
the
name
occurs
see
king
of
vol
i
ivy
it
is
possible
that
the
sukkalu
who
ruled
in
elam
during
the
reign
of
was
named
for
a
short
inscription
of
this
ruler
has
been
recovered
in
which
he
records
that
he
built
and
dedicated
a
certain
temple
with
the
object
of
ensuring
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
if
we
may
identify
the
of
this
text
with
the
great
elamite
conqueror
it
follows
that
the
sukkal
of
susa
was
his
subordinate
the
inscription
mentions
other
names
which
are
possibly
those
of
rulers
of
this
period
and
reads
as
follows
sukkal
of
susa
the
son
of
the
sister
of
hath
built
a
temple
of
bricks
at
for
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
and
for
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
and
for
the
preservation
of
his
own
life
and
for
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
and
of
as
is
mentioned
immediately
after
he
was
possibly
his
son
and
he
may
have
succeeded
him
as
ruler
of
the
empire
of
elam
and
babylonia
though
no
confirmation
of
this
view
has
yet
been
discovered
is
mentioned
immediately
after
the
reference
to
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
himself
and
it
may
be
conjectured
that
the
name
was
that
of
son
or
possibly
that
of
his
wife
in
which
event
the
last
two
personages
mentioned
in
the
text
may
have
been
the
sons
of
this
short
text
affords
a
good
example
of
one
class
of
votive
inscriptions
from
which
it
is
possible
to
recover
the
names
of
elamite
rulers
of
this
period
and
it
illustrates
the
uncertainty
which
at
present
attaches
to
the
identification
of
the
names
themselves
and
the
order
in
which
they
are
to
be
arranged
such
uncertainty
necessarily
exists
when
only
a
few
texts
have
been
recovered
and
it
will
disappear
with
the
discovery
of
additional
monuments
by
which
the
results
already
arrived
at
may
be
checked
we
need
not
here
enumerate
all
the
names
of
the
later
elamite
rulers
which
have
been
found
in
the
numerous
votive
inscriptions
recovered
during
the
recent
excavations
at
susa
the
order
in
which
they
should
be
arranged
is
still
a
matter
of
considerable
uncertainty
and
the
facts
recorded
by
them
in
such
inscriptions
as
we
possess
mainly
concern
the
building
and
restoration
of
elamite
temples
and
the
decoration
of
shrines
and
they
are
thus
of
no
great
historical
interest
these
votive
texts
are
well
illustrated
by
a
remarkable
find
of
foundation
deposits
made
last
year
by
de
morgan
in
the
temple
of
shushinak
at
susa
consisting
of
figures
and
jewelry
of
gold
and
silver
and
objects
of
lead
bronze
iron
stone
and
ivory
vases
etc
this
is
the
richest
foundation
deposit
that
has
been
recovered
on
any
ancient
site
and
its
archaeological
interest
in
connection
with
the
development
of
elamite
art
is
great
but
in
no
other
way
does
the
find
affect
our
conception
of
the
history
of
the
country
and
we
may
therefore
pass
on
to
a
consideration
of
such
recent
discoveries
as
throw
new
light
upon
the
course
of
history
in
western
asia
with
the
advent
of
the
first
dynasty
in
babylon
elam
found
herself
face
to
face
with
a
power
prepared
to
dispute
her
claims
to
exercise
a
suzerainty
over
the
plains
of
mesopotamia
it
is
held
by
many
writers
that
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
was
of
arab
origin
and
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
this
view
pognon
was
the
first
to
start
the
theory
that
its
kings
were
not
purely
babylonian
but
were
of
either
arab
or
aramaean
extraction
and
he
based
his
theory
on
a
study
of
the
forms
of
the
names
which
some
of
them
bore
the
name
of
for
instance
means
sun
is
our
god
but
the
form
of
the
words
of
which
the
name
is
composed
betray
foreign
influence
thus
in
babylonian
the
name
for
or
the
would
be
or
not
in
the
second
half
of
the
name
while
is
good
babylonian
the
ending
which
is
the
pronominal
suffix
of
the
first
person
plural
is
not
babylonian
but
arabic
we
need
not
here
enter
into
a
long
philological
discussion
and
the
instance
already
cited
may
suffice
to
show
in
what
way
many
of
the
names
met
in
the
babylonian
inscriptions
of
this
period
betray
a
foreign
and
possibly
an
arabic
origin
but
whether
we
assign
the
forms
of
these
names
to
arabic
influence
or
not
it
may
be
regarded
as
certain
that
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
had
its
origin
in
the
incursion
into
babylonia
of
a
new
wave
of
semitic
immigration
illustration
brick
stamped
with
an
inscription
of
the
invading
semites
brought
with
them
fresh
blood
and
unexhausted
energy
and
finding
many
of
their
own
race
in
scattered
cities
and
settlements
throughout
the
country
they
succeeded
in
establishing
a
purely
semitic
dynasty
with
its
capital
at
babylon
and
set
about
the
task
of
freeing
the
country
from
any
vestiges
of
foreign
control
many
centuries
earlier
semitic
kings
had
ruled
in
babylonian
cities
and
semitic
empires
had
been
formed
there
sargon
and
having
their
capital
at
agade
had
established
their
control
over
a
considerable
area
of
western
asia
and
had
held
elam
as
a
province
but
so
far
as
elam
was
concerned
had
reversed
the
balance
and
had
raised
elam
to
the
position
of
the
predominant
power
of
the
struggles
and
campaigns
of
the
earlier
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
we
know
little
for
although
we
possess
a
considerable
number
of
legal
and
commercial
documents
of
the
period
we
have
recovered
no
strictly
historical
inscriptions
our
main
source
of
information
is
the
dates
upon
these
documents
which
are
not
dated
by
the
years
of
the
reigning
king
but
on
a
system
adopted
by
the
early
babylonian
kings
from
their
sumerian
predecessors
in
the
later
periods
of
babylonian
history
tablets
were
dated
in
the
year
of
the
king
who
was
reigning
at
the
time
the
document
was
drawn
up
but
this
simple
system
had
not
been
adopted
at
this
early
period
in
place
of
this
we
find
that
each
year
was
cited
by
the
event
of
greatest
importance
which
occurred
in
that
year
this
event
might
be
the
cutting
of
a
canal
when
the
year
in
which
this
took
place
might
be
referred
to
as
year
in
which
the
canal
named
was
cut
or
it
might
be
the
building
of
a
temple
as
in
the
year
in
which
the
great
temple
of
the
was
built
or
it
might
be
conquest
of
a
city
such
as
the
year
in
which
the
city
of
kish
was
now
it
will
be
obvious
that
this
system
of
dating
had
many
disadvantages
an
event
might
be
of
great
importance
for
one
city
while
it
might
never
have
been
heard
of
in
another
district
thus
it
sometimes
happened
that
the
same
event
was
not
adopted
throughout
the
whole
country
for
designating
a
particular
year
and
the
result
was
that
different
systems
of
dating
were
employed
in
different
parts
of
babylonia
moreover
when
a
particular
system
had
been
in
use
for
a
considerable
time
it
required
a
very
good
memory
to
retain
the
order
and
period
of
the
various
events
referred
to
in
the
so
as
to
fix
in
a
moment
the
date
of
a
document
by
its
mention
of
one
of
them
in
order
to
assist
themselves
in
their
task
of
fixing
dates
in
this
manner
the
scribes
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
drew
up
lists
of
the
titles
of
the
years
arranged
in
chronological
order
under
the
reigns
of
the
kings
to
which
they
referred
some
of
these
lists
have
been
recovered
and
they
are
of
the
greatest
assistance
in
fixing
the
chronology
while
at
the
same
time
they
furnish
us
with
considerable
information
concerning
the
history
of
the
period
of
which
we
should
otherwise
have
been
in
ignorance
from
these
lists
of
and
from
the
dates
themselves
which
are
found
upon
the
legal
and
commercial
tablets
of
the
period
we
learn
that
kish
and
isin
all
gave
trouble
to
the
earlier
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
and
had
in
turn
to
be
subdued
elam
did
not
watch
the
diminution
of
her
influence
in
babylonia
without
a
struggle
to
retain
it
under
who
was
prince
or
governor
of
the
districts
lying
along
the
frontier
of
elam
the
elamites
struggled
hard
to
maintain
their
position
in
babylonia
making
the
city
of
ur
the
centre
from
which
they
sought
to
check
the
growing
power
of
babylon
from
bricks
that
have
been
recovered
from
mukayyer
the
site
of
the
city
of
ur
we
learn
that
rebuilt
the
temple
in
that
city
dedicated
to
the
which
is
an
indication
of
the
firm
hold
he
had
obtained
upon
the
city
it
was
obvious
to
the
new
semitic
dynasty
in
babylon
that
until
ur
and
the
neighbouring
city
of
larsam
had
been
captured
they
could
entertain
no
hope
of
removing
the
elamite
yoke
from
southern
babylonia
it
is
probable
that
the
earlier
kings
of
the
dynasty
made
many
attempts
to
capture
them
with
varying
success
an
echo
of
one
of
their
struggles
in
which
they
claimed
the
victory
may
be
seen
in
the
for
the
fourteenth
year
of
the
reign
of
father
and
predecessor
on
the
throne
of
babylon
this
year
was
referred
to
in
the
documents
of
the
period
as
year
in
which
the
people
of
ur
were
slain
with
the
it
will
be
noted
that
the
capture
of
the
city
is
not
commemorated
so
that
we
may
infer
that
the
slaughter
of
the
elamites
which
is
recorded
did
not
materially
reduce
their
influence
as
they
were
left
in
possession
of
their
principal
stronghold
in
fact
elam
was
not
signally
defeated
in
the
reign
of
but
in
that
of
his
son
from
the
of
reign
we
learn
that
the
struggle
between
elam
and
babylon
was
brought
to
a
climax
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
his
reign
when
it
is
recorded
in
the
formulas
that
he
defeated
the
elamite
army
and
overthrew
while
in
the
following
year
we
gather
that
he
added
the
land
of
that
is
the
western
district
of
elam
to
his
dominions
an
unpublished
chronicle
in
the
british
museum
gives
us
further
details
of
victory
over
the
elamites
and
at
the
same
time
makes
it
clear
that
the
defeat
and
overthrow
of
was
not
so
crushing
as
has
hitherto
been
supposed
this
chronicle
relates
that
hammurabi
attacked
and
after
capturing
the
cities
of
ur
and
larsam
carried
their
spoil
to
babylon
up
to
the
present
it
has
been
supposed
that
victory
marked
the
end
of
elamite
influence
in
babylonia
and
that
thenceforward
the
supremacy
of
babylon
was
established
throughout
the
whole
of
the
country
but
from
the
new
chronicle
we
gather
that
hammurabi
did
not
succeed
in
finally
suppressing
the
attempts
of
elam
to
regain
her
former
position
it
is
true
that
the
cities
of
ur
and
larsam
were
finally
incorporated
in
the
babylonian
empire
and
the
letters
of
hammurabi
to
the
governor
whom
he
placed
in
authority
over
larsam
afford
abundant
evidence
of
the
stringency
of
the
administrative
control
which
he
established
over
southern
babylonia
but
was
only
crippled
for
the
time
and
on
being
driven
from
ur
and
larsam
he
retired
beyond
the
elamite
frontier
and
devoted
his
energies
to
the
recuperation
of
his
forces
against
the
time
when
he
should
feel
himself
strong
enough
again
to
make
a
bid
for
victory
in
his
struggle
against
the
growing
power
of
babylon
it
is
probable
that
he
made
no
further
attempt
to
renew
the
contest
during
the
life
of
hammurabi
but
after
the
son
of
hammurabi
had
succeeded
to
the
babylonian
throne
he
appeared
in
babylonia
at
the
head
of
the
forces
he
had
collected
and
attempted
to
regain
the
cities

made
no

freed

quarter

than
the
first
king
of
the
second
dynasty
and
so
far
from
having
been
regarded
as
contemporary
hitherto
it
has
been
imagined
that
he
ascended
the
throne
of
babylon
one
hundred
and
eighteen
years
after
death
the
new
information
supplied
by
the
chronicle
thus
proves
two
important
facts
first
that
the
second
dynasty
instead
of
immediately
succeeding
the
first
dynasty
was
partly
contemporary
with
it
second
that
during
the
period
in
which
the
two
dynasties
were
contemporary
they
were
at
war
with
one
another
the
second
dynasty
gradually
encroaching
on
the
territory
of
the
first
dynasty
until
it
eventually
succeeded
in
capturing
babylon
and
in
getting
the
whole
of
the
country
under
its
control
we
also
learn
from
the
new
chronicle
that
this
second
dynasty
at
first
established
itself
in
country
of
the
sea
that
is
to
say
the
districts
in
the
extreme
south
of
babylonia
bordering
on
the
persian
gulf
and
afterwards
extended
its
borders
northward
until
it
gradually
absorbed
the
whole
of
babylonia
before
discussing
the
other
facts
supplied
by
the
new
chronicle
with
regard
to
the
rise
and
growth
of
the
country
of
the
sea
whose
kings
formed
the
dynasty
it
will
be
well
to
refer
briefly
to
the
sources
from
which
the
information
on
the
period
to
be
found
in
the
current
histories
is
derived
all
the
schemes
of
babylonian
chronology
that
have
been
suggested
during
the
last
twenty
years
have
been
based
mainly
on
the
great
list
of
kings
which
is
preserved
in
the
british
museum
this
document
was
drawn
up
in
the
or
persian
period
and
when
complete
it
gave
a
list
of
the
names
of
all
the
babylonian
kings
from
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
down
to
the
time
in
which
it
was
written
the
names
of
the
kings
are
arranged
in
dynasties
and
details
are
given
as
to
the
length
of
their
reigns
and
the
total
number
of
years
each
dynasty
lasted
the
beginning
of
the
list
which
gave
the
names
of
the
first
dynasty
is
wanting
but
the
missing
portion
has
been
restored
from
a
smaller
document
which
gives
a
list
of
the
kings
of
the
first
and
second
dynasties
only
in
the
great
list
of
kings
the
dynasties
are
arranged
one
after
the
other
and
it
was
obvious
that
its
compiler
imagined
that
they
succeeded
one
another
in
the
order
in
which
he
arranged
them
but
when
the
total
number
of
years
the
dynasties
lasted
is
learned
we
obtain
dates
for
the
first
dynasties
in
the
list
which
are
too
early
to
agree
with
other
chronological
information
supplied
by
the
historical
inscriptions
the
majority
of
writers
have
accepted
the
figures
of
the
list
of
kings
and
have
been
content
to
ignore
the
discrepancies
others
have
sought
to
reconcile
the
available
data
by
ingenious
emendations
of
the
figures
given
by
the
list
and
the
historical
inscriptions
or
have
omitted
the
second
dynasty
entirely
from
their
calculations
the
new
chronicle
by
showing
that
the
first
and
second
dynasties
were
partly
contemporaneous
explains
the
discrepancies
that
have
hitherto
proved
so
puzzling
it
would
be
out
of
place
here
to
enter
into
a
detailed
discussion
of
babylonian
chronology
and
therefore
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
a
brief
description
of
the
sequence
of
events
as
revealed
by
the
new
chronicle
according
to
the
list
of
kings
reign
was
a
long
one
lasting
for
sixty
years
and
the
new
chronicle
gives
no
indication
as
to
the
period
of
his
reign
at
which
active
hostilities
with
babylon
broke
out
if
the
war
occurred
in
the
latter
portion
of
his
reign
it
would
follow
that
he
had
been
for
many
years
organizing
the
forces
of
the
new
state
he
had
founded
in
the
south
of
babylonia
before
making
serious
encroachments
in
the
north
and
in
that
case
the
incessant
campaigns
carried
on
by
babylon
against
blam
in
the
reigns
of
hammurabi
and
would
have
afforded
him
the
opportunity
of
establishing
a
firm
foothold
in
the
country
of
the
sea
without
the
risk
of
babylonian
interference
if
on
the
other
hand
it
was
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
reign
that
hostilities
with
babylon
broke
out
we
may
suppose
that
while
was
devoting
all
his
energies
to
crush
the
country
of
the
sea
declared
her
independence
of
babylonian
control
in
this
case
we
may
imagine
hurrying
south
on
the
conclusion
of
his
elamite
campaign
to
crush
the
newly
formed
state
before
it
had
had
time
to
organize
its
forces
for
prolonged
resistance
whichever
of
these
alternatives
eventually
may
prove
to
be
correct
it
is
certain
that
took
the
initiative
in
struggle
with
the
country
of
the
sea
and
that
his
action
was
due
either
to
her
declaration
of
independence
or
to
some
daring
act
of
aggression
on
the
part
of
this
small
state
which
had
hitherto
appeared
too
insignificant
to
cause
babylon
any
serious
trouble
the
new
chronicle
tells
us
that
undertook
two
expeditions
against
the
country
of
the
sea
both
of
which
proved
unsuccessful
in
the
first
of
these
he
penetrated
to
the
very
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
where
a
battle
took
place
in
which
was
defeated
and
the
bodies
of
many
of
the
babylonian
soldiers
were
washed
away
by
the
sea
in
the
second
campaign
did
not
await
attack
but
advanced
to
meet
him
and
again
defeated
the
babylonian
army
in
the
reign
of
son
and
successor
appears
to
have
undertaken
fresh
acts
of
aggression
against
babylon
and
it
was
probably
during
one
of
his
raids
in
babylonian
territory
that
attempted
to
crush
the
growing
power
of
the
country
of
the
sea
by
the
capture
of
its
daring
leader
himself
the
new
chronicle
informs
us
that
with
this
object
in
view
dammed
the
river
tigris
hoping
by
this
means
to
cut
off
and
his
army
but
his
stratagem
did
not
succeed
and
got
back
to
his
own
territory
in
safety
the
new
chronicle
does
not
supply
us
with
further
details
of
the
struggle
between
babylon
and
the
country
of
the
sea
but
we
may
conclude
that
all
similar
attempts
on
the
part
of
the
later
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
to
crush
or
restrain
the
power
of
the
new
state
were
useless
it
is
probable
that
from
this
time
forward
the
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
accepted
the
independence
of
the
country
of
the
sea
upon
their
southern
border
as
an
evil
which
they
were
powerless
to
prevent
they
must
have
looked
back
with
regret
to
the
good
times
the
country
had
enjoyed
under
the
powerful
sway
of
hammurabi
whose
victorious
arms
even
their
ancient
foes
the
blamites
had
been
unable
to
withstand
but
although
the
chronicle
does
not
recount
the
further
successes
achieved
by
the
country
of
the
sea
it
records
a
fact
which
undoubtedly
contributed
to
hasten
the
fall
of
babylon
and
bring
the
first
dynasty
to
an
end
it
tells
us
that
in
the
reign
of
the
last
king
of
the
first
dynasty
the
men
of
the
land
of
khattu
the
hittites
from
northern
syria
marched
against
him
in
order
to
conquer
the
land
of
akkad
in
other
words
they
marched
down
the
euphrates
and
invaded
northern
babylonia
the
chronicle
does
not
state
how
far
the
invasion
was
successful
but
the
appearance
of
a
new
enemy
from
the
northwest
must
have
divided
the
babylonian
forces
and
thus
have
reduced
their
power
of
resisting
pressure
from
the
country
of
the
sea
may
have
succeeded
in
defeating
the
hittites
and
in
driving
them
from
his
country
but
the
fact
that
he
was
the
last
king
of
the
first
dynasty
proves
that
in
his
reign
babylon
itself
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
king
of
the
country
of
the
sea
the
question
now
arises
to
what
race
did
the
people
of
the
country
of
the
sea
belong
did
they
represent
an
of
the
kassite
tribes
who
eventually
succeeded
in
establishing
themselves
as
the
third
dynasty
in
babylon
or
were
they
the
elamites
who
when
driven
from
ur
and
larsam
retreated
southwards
and
maintained
their
independence
on
the
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
or
did
they
represent
some
fresh
wave
of
semitic
that
they
were
not
kassites
is
proved
by
the
new
chronicle
which
relates
how
the
country
of
the
sea
was
conquered
by
the
kassites
and
how
the
dynasty
founded
by
thus
came
to
an
end
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
they
were
elamites
and
if
the
country
of
the
sea
had
been
colonized
by
fresh
semitic
tribes
so
far
from
opposing
their
kindred
in
babylon
most
probably
they
would
have
proved
to
them
a
source
of
additional
strength
and
support
in
fact
there
are
indications
that
the
people
of
the
country
of
the
sea
are
to
be
referred
to
an
older
stock
than
the
elamites
the
semites
or
the
kassites
in
the
dynasty
of
the
country
of
the
sea
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
may
trace
the
last
successful
struggle
of
the
ancient
sumerians
to
retain
possession
of
the
land
which
they
had
held
for
so
many
centuries
before
the
invading
semites
had
disputed
its
possession
with
them
evidence
of
the
sumerian
origin
of
the
kings
of
the
country
of
the
sea
may
be
traced
in
the
names
which
several
of
them
bear
ishkibal
grulkishar
and
the
names
of
some
of
them
are
all
good
sumerian
names
and
shushshi
the
brother
of
ishkibal
may
also
be
taken
as
a
sumerian
name
it
is
true
that
the
first
three
kings
of
the
dynasty
and
and
the
last
king
of
the
dynasty
bear
semitic
babylonian
names
but
there
is
evidence
that
at
least
one
of
these
is
merely
a
semitic
rendering
of
a
sumerian
equivalent
the
founder
of
the
dynasty
has
left
inscriptions
in
which
his
name
is
written
in
its
correct
sumerian
form
as
and
the
fact
that
he
and
some
of
his
successors
either
bore
semitic
names
or
appear
in
the
late
list
of
kings
with
their
sumerian
names
translated
into
babylonian
form
may
be
easily
explained
by
supposing
that
the
population
of
the
country
of
the
sea
was
mixed
and
that
the
sumerian
and
semitic
tongues
were
to
a
great
extent
employed
indiscriminately
this
supposition
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
suggestion
that
the
dynasty
of
the
country
of
the
sea
was
sumerian
and
that
under
it
the
sumerians
once
more
became
the
predominant
race
in
babylonia
the
new
chronicle
also
relates
how
the
dynasty
of
the
country
of
the
sea
succumbed
in
its
turn
before
the
incursions
of
the
kassites
we
know
that
already
under
the
first
dynasty
the
kassite
tribes
had
begun
to
make
incursions
into
babylonia
for
the
ninth
year
of
was
named
in
the
after
a
kassite
invasion
which
as
it
was
commemorated
in
this
manner
by
the
babylonians
was
probably
successfully
repulsed
such
invasions
must
have
taken
place
from
time
to
time
during
the
period
of
supremacy
attained
by
the
country
of
the
sea
and
it
was
undoubtedly
with
a
view
to
stopping
such
incursions
for
the
future
that
the
last
king
of
the
second
dynasty
decided
to
invade
elam
and
conquer
the
mountainous
districts
in
which
the
kassite
tribes
had
built
their
strongholds
this
elamite
campaign
of
is
recorded
by
the
new
chronicle
which
relates
how
he
was
defeated
and
driven
from
the
country
by
the
brother
of
bitiliash
the
kassite
did
not
rest
content
with
repelling
invasion
of
his
land
but
pursued
him
across
the
border
and
succeeded
in
conquering
the
country
of
the
sea
and
in
establishing
there
his
own
administration
the
gradual
conquest
of
the
whole
of
babylonia
by
the
kassites
no
doubt
followed
the
conquest
of
the
country
of
the
sea
for
the
chronicle
relates
how
the
process
of
subjugation
begun
by
was
continued
by
his
nephew
agum
and
we
know
from
the
lists
of
kings
that
was
the
last
king
of
the
dynasty
founded
by
in
this
fashion
the
second
dynasty
was
brought
to
an
end
and
the
sumerian
element
in
the
mixed
population
of
babylonia
did
not
again
succeed
in
gaining
control
of
the
government
of
the
country
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
account
of
the
earliest
kassite
rulers
of
babylonia
which
is
given
by
the
new
chronicle
does
not
exactly
tally
with
the
names
of
the
kings
of
the
third
dynasty
as
found
upon
the
list
of
kings
on
this
document
the
first
king
of
the
dynasty
is
named
gandash
with
whom
we
may
probably
identify
the
kassite
conqueror
of
the
country
of
the
sea
the
second
king
is
agum
and
the
third
is
bitiliashi
according
to
the
new
chronicle
agum
was
the
son
of
bitiliashi
and
it
would
be
improbable
that
he
should
have
ruled
in
babylonia
before
his
father
but
this
difficulty
is
removed
by
supposing
that
the
two
names
were
transposed
by
some
copyist
the
different
names
assigned
to
the
founder
of
the
kassite
dynasty
may
be
due
to
the
existence
of
variant
traditions
or
may
have
assumed
another
name
on
his
conquest
of
babylonia
a
practice
which
was
usual
with
the
later
kings
of
assyria
when
they
occupied
the
babylonian
throne
the
information
supplied
by
the
new
chronicle
with
regard
to
the
relations
of
the
first
three
dynasties
to
one
another
is
of
the
greatest
possible
interest
to
the
student
of
early
babylonian
history
we
see
that
the
semitic
empire
founded
at
babylon
by
and
consolidated
by
hammurabi
was
not
established
on
so
firm
a
basis
as
has
hitherto
been
believed
the
later
kings
of
the
dynasty
after
elam
had
been
conquered
had
to
defend
their
empire
from
encroachments
on
the
south
and
they
eventually
succumbed
before
the
onslaught
of
the
sumerian
element
which
still
remained
in
the
population
of
babylonia
and
had
rallied
in
the
country
of
the
sea
this
dynasty
in
its
turn
succumbed
before
the
invasion
of
the
kassites
from
the
mountains
in
the
western
districts
of
elam
and
although
the
city
of
babylon
retained
her
position
as
the
capital
of
the
country
throughout
these
changes
of
government
she
was
the
capital
of
rulers
of
different
races
who
successively
fought
for
and
obtained
the
control
of
the
fertile
plains
of
mesopotamia
it
is
probable
that
the
kassite
kings
of
the
third
dynasty
exercised
authority
not
only
over
babylonia
but
also
over
the
greater
part
of
elam
for
a
number
of
inscriptions
of
kassite
kings
of
babylonia
have
been
found
by
de
morgan
at
susa
these
inscriptions
consist
of
grants
of
land
written
on
roughly
shaped
stone
stelæ
a
class
which
the
babylonians
themselves
called
while
they
have
been
frequently
referred
to
by
modern
writers
as
this
latter
term
is
not
very
happily
chosen
for
it
suggests
that
the
actual
monuments
themselves
were
set
up
on
the
limits
of
a
field
or
estate
to
mark
its
boundary
it
is
true
that
the
inscription
on
a
kudurru
enumerates
the
exact
position
and
size
of
the
estate
with
which
it
is
concerned
but
the
kudurru
was
never
actually
used
to
mark
the
boundary
it
was
preserved
as
a
in
the
house
of
the
owner
of
the
estate
or
possibly
in
the
temple
of
his
god
and
formed
his
charter
or
to
which
he
could
appeal
in
case
of
any
dispute
arising
as
to
his
right
of
ownership
one
of
the
kudurrus
found
by
de
morgan
records
the
grant
of
a
number
of
estates
near
babylon
by
nazimaruttash
a
king
of
the
third
or
kassite
dynasty
to
the
god
marduk
that

they
were

the
gift
of
considerable
tracts
of
land
in
the
same
district
to
a
private
individual
named
who
was
to
enjoy
a
similar
freedom
from
taxation
so
far
as
the
lands
bestowed
upon
him
were
concerned
this
freedom
from
taxation
is
specially
enacted
by
the
document
in
the
words
in
the
days
that
are
to
come
the
ruler
of
the
country
or
one
of
the
governors
or
directors
or
wardens
of
these
districts
shall
make
any
claim
with
regard
to
these
estates
or
shall
attempt
to
impose
the
payment
of
a
tithe
or
tax
upon
them
may
all
the
great
gods
whose
names
are
commemorated
or
whose
arms
are
portrayed
or
whose
are
represented
on
this
stone
curse
him
with
an
evil
curse
and
blot
out
his
name
incidentally
this
curse
illustrates
one
of
the
most
striking
characteristics
of
the
kudurrus
or
viz
the
carved
figures
of
gods
and
representations
of
their
emblems
which
all
of
them
bare
in
addition
to
the
texts
inscribed
upon
them
at
one
time
it
was
thought
that
these
symbols
were
to
be
connected
with
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
and
various
constellations
and
stars
and
it
was
suggested
that
they
might
have
been
intended
to
represent
the
relative
positions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
at
the
time
the
document
was
drawn
up
but
this
text
of
nazimaruttash
and
other
similar
documents
that
have
recently
been
discovered
prove
that
the
presence
of
the
figures
and
emblems
of
the
gods
upon
the
stones
is
to
be
explained
on
another
and
far
more
simple
theory
they
were
placed
there
as
guardians
of
the
property
to
which
the
kudurru
referred
and
it
was
believed
that
the
carving
of
their
figures
or
emblems
upon
the
stone
would
ensure
their
intervention
in
case
of
any
attempted
infringement
of
the
rights
and
privileges
which
it
was
the
object
of
the
document
to
commemorate
and
preserve
a
photographic
reproduction
of
one
side
of
the
kudurru
of
is
shown
in
the
accompanying
illustration
there
will
be
seen
a
representation
of
gula
or
bau
the
mother
of
the
gods
who
is
portrayed
as
seated
on
her
throne
and
wearing
the
and
a
long
robe
that
reaches
to
her
feet
in
the
field
are
emblems
of
the
the
ishtar
and
other
deities
and
the
representation
of
divine
emblems
and
is
continued
on
another
face
of
the
stone
round
the
corner
towards
which
grula
is
looking
the
other
two
faces
of
the
document
are
taken
up
with
the
inscription
an
interesting
note
is
appended
to
the
text
inscribed
upon
the
stone
beginning
under
the
throne
and
feet
of
marduk
and
continuing
under
the
emblems
of
the
gods
upon
the
other
side
this
note
relates
the
history
of
the
document
in
the
following
words
those
days
the
son
of
inscribed
this
document
upon
a
memorial
of
clay
and
he
set
it
before
his
god
but
in
the
reign
of
king
of
hosts
the
son
of
melishikhu
king
of
babylon
the
wall
fell
upon
this
memorial
and
crushed
it
the
son
of
nibishiku
wrote
a
copy
of
the
ancient
text
upon
a
new
stone
stele
and
he
set
it
before
the
god
it
will
be
seen
therefore
that
this
actual
stone
that
has
been
recovered
was
not
the
document
drawn
up
in
the
reign
of
nazimaruttash
but
a
copy
made
under
a
later
king
of
the
third
dynasty
the
original
deed
was
drawn
up
to
preserve
the
rights
of
who
shared
the
grant
of
land
with
the
temple
of
marduk
his
share
was
less
than
half
that
of
the
temple
but
as
both
were
situated
in
the
same
district
he
was
careful
to
enumerate
and
describe
the
share
to
prevent
any
encroachment
on
his
rights
by
the
babylonian
priests
it
is
probable
that
such
grants
of
land
were
made
to
private
individuals
in
return
for
special
services
which
they
had
rendered
to
the
king

even
as
he
himself
has

the

ends
with
some
very
vivid
curses

any
one

should
make
any
encroachments

as
has
already
been
remarked
it
was
believed
that
by
carving
them
upon
the
their
help
in
guarding
the
stone
itself
and
its
enactments
was
assured
from
the
portion
of
the
text
inscribed
upon
the
stone
which
has
just
been
translated
it
is
seen
that
the
owner
of
land
in
babylonia
in
the
period
of
the
kassite
kings
unless
he
was
granted
special
exemption
was
liable
to
furnish
forced
labour
for
public
works
to
the
state
or
to
his
district
to
furnish
grazing
and
pasture
for
the
flocks
and
herds
of
the
king
or
governor
and
to
pay
various
taxes
and
tithes
on
his
land
his
water
for
irrigation
and
his
crops
from
the
numerous
documents
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
that
have
been
recovered
and
published
within
the
last
few
years
we
know
that
similar
customs
were
prevalent
at
that
period
so
that
it
is
clear
that
the
successive
conquests
to
which
the
country
was
subjected
and
the
establishment
of
different
dynasties
of
foreign
kings
at
babylon
did
not
to
any
appreciable
extent
affect
the
life
and
customs
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
or
even
the
general
character
of
its
government
and
administration

legal
nature

they
have
not

the
information
we
possess
concerning
the
life
of
the
people
in
this
period
is
obtained
indirectly
from
kudurrus
or
such
as
those
of

with
the

earlier
in
this
chapter
our
information
for
this
period
is
confined
to
one
or
two
short
votive
inscriptions

the
case
is
very
different

being
comparatively
full

complete

how

for

the

the
number
and
importance
of
the
original
documents
on
which
this
connected
narration
is
based
vary
enormously
for
different
periods
gaps
occur
in
our
knowledge
of
the
sequence
of
events
which
with
some
ingenuity
may
be
bridged
over
by
means
of
the
native
lists
of
kings
and
the
genealogies
furnished
by
the
historical
inscriptions
on
the
other
hand
as
if
to
make
up
for
such
parsimony
the
excavations
have
yielded
a
wealth
of
material
for
illustrating
the
conditions
of
early
babylonian
life
which
prevailed
in
such
periods
the
most
fortunate
of
these
periods
so
far
as
the
recovery
of
its
records
is
concerned
is
undoubtedly
the
period
of
the
semitic
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
and
in
particular
the
reign
of
its
greatest
ruler
hammurabi
when
maspero
wrote
his
history
thousands
of
clay
tablets
inscribed
with
legal
and
commercial
documents
and
dated
in
the
reigns
of
these
early
kings
had
already
been
recovered
and
the
information
they
furnished
was
duly
summarized
by
him
but
since
that
time
two
other
sources
of
information
have
been
made
available
which
have
largely
increased
our
knowledge
of
the
constitution
of
the
early
babylonian
state
its
system
of
administration
and
the
conditions
of
life
of
the
various
classes
of
the
population
most
of
these
tablets
are
preserved

number
of
similar
tablets
of
this
period
preserved
in
the
pennsylvania
museum
will
shortly
be
published
by
ranke
one
of
these
new
sources
of
information
consists
of
a
remarkable
series
of
royal
letters
written
by
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
which
has
been
recovered
and
is
now
preserved
in
the
british
museum
the
letters
were
addressed
to
the
governors
and
high
officials
of
various
great
cities
in
babylonia
and
they
contain
the
orders
with
regard
to
details
of
the
administration
of
the
country
which
had
been
brought
to
his
notice
the
range
of
subjects
with
which
they
deal
is
enormous
and
there
is
scarcely
one
of
them
which
does
not
add
to
our
knowledge
of
the
period
the
other
new
source
of
information
is
the
great
code
of
laws
drawn
up
by
hammurabi
for
the
guidance
of
his
people
and
defining
the
duties
and
privileges
of
all
classes
of
his
subjects
the
discovery
of
which
at
susa
has
been
described
in
a
previous
chapter
the
laws
are
engraved
on
a
great
stele
of
diorite
in
no
less
than
columns
of
writing
of
which
are
preserved
and
at
the
head
of
the
stele
is
sculptured
a
representation
of
the
king
receiving
them
from
shamash
the
see
king
letters
and
inscriptions
of
hammurabi
vols
this
code
shows
to
what
an
extent
the
administration
of
law
and
justice
had
been
developed
in
babylonia
in
the
time
of
the
first
dynasty
from
the
contracts
and
letters
of
the
period
we
already
knew
that
regular
judges
and
duly
appointed
courts
of
law
were
in
existence
and
the
code
itself
was
evidently
intended
by
the
king
to
give
the
royal
sanction
to
a
great
body
of
legal
decisions
and
enactments
which
already
possessed
the
authority
conferred
by
custom
and
tradition
the
means
by
which
such
a
code
could
have
come
into
existence
are
illustrated
by
the
system
of
procedure
adopted
in
the
courts
at
this
period
after
a
case
had
been
heard
and
judgment
had
been
given
a
summary
of
the
case
and
of
the
evidence
together
with
the
judgment
was
drawn
up
and
written
out
on
tablets
in
due
legal
form
and
phraseology
a
list
of
the
witnesses
was
appended
and
after
the
tablet
had
been
dated
and
sealed
it
was
stored
away
among
the
legal
archives
of
the
court
where
it
was
ready
for
production
in
the
event
of
any
future
appeal
or
case
in
which
the
recorded
decision
was
involved
this
procedure
represents
an
advanced
stage
in
the
system
of
judicial
administration
but
the
care
which
was
taken
for
the
preservation
of
the
judgments
given
was
evidently
traditional
and
would
naturally
give
rise
in
course
of
time
to
the
existence
of
a
recognized
code
of
laws
moreover
when
once
a
judgment
had
been
given
and
had
been
duly
recorded
it
was
irrevocable
and
if
any
judge
attempted
to
alter
such
a
decision
he
was
severely
punished
for
not
only
was
he
expelled
from
his
and
debarred
from
exercising
judicial
functions
in
the
future
but
if
his
judgment
had
involved
the
infliction
of
a
penalty
he
was
obliged
to
pay
twelve
times
the
amount
to
the
man
he
had
condemned
such
an
enactment
must
have
occasionally
given
rise
to
hardship
or
injustice
but
at
least
it
must
have
had
the
effect
of
imbuing
the
judges
with
a
sense
of
their
responsibility
and
of
instilling
a
respect
for
their
decisions
in
the
minds
of
the
people
a
further
check
upon
injustice
was
provided
by
the
custom
of
the
elders
of
the
city
who
sat
with
the
judge
and
assisted
him
in
the
carrying
out
of
his
duties
and
it
was
always
open
to
a
man
if
he
believed
that
he
could
not
get
justice
enforced
to
make
an
appeal
to
the
king
it
is
not
our
present
purpose
to
give
a
technical
discussion
of
the
legal
contents
of
the
code
but
rather
to
examine
it
with
the
object
of
ascertaining
what
light
it
throws
upon
ancient
babylonian
life
and
customs
and
the
conditions
under
which
the
people
lived
the
code
gives
a
good
deal
of
information
with
regard
to
the
family
life
of
the
babylonians
and
above
all
proves
the
sanctity
with
which
the
was
invested
the
claims
that
were
involved
by
marriage
were
not
lightly
undertaken
any
marriage
to
be
legally
binding
had
to
be
accompanied
by
a
duly
executed
and
attested
if
a
man
had
taken
a
woman
to
wife
without
having
carried
out
this
necessary
preliminary
the
woman
was
not
regarded
as
his
wife
in
the
legal
sense
on
the
other
hand
when
once
such
a
had
been
drawn
up
its
inviolability
was
stringently
secured
a
case
of
proved
adultery
on
the
part
of
a
wife
was
punished
by
the
drowning
of
the
guilty
parties
though
the
husband
of
the
woman
if
he
wished
to
save
his
wife
could
do
so
by
an
appeal
to
the
king
similarly
death
was
the
penalty
for
a
man
who
ravished
another
betrothed
wife
while
she
was
still
living
in
her
house
but
in
this
case
the
innocence
and
inexperience
were
taken
into
account
and
no
penalty
was
enforced
against
her
and
she
was
allowed
to
go
free
where
the
adultery
of
a
wife
was
not
proved
and
only
depended
on
the
accusation
of
the
husband
the
woman
could
clear
herself
by
swearing
her
own
innocence
if
however
the
accusation
was
not
brought
by
the
husband
himself
but
by
others
the
woman
could
clear
herself
by
submitting
to
the
ordeal
by
water
that
is
to
say
she
would
plunge
into
the
euphrates
if
the
river
carried
her
away
and
she
were
drowned
it
was
regarded
as
proof
that
the
accusation
was
well
founded
if
on
the
contrary
she
survived
and
got
safely
to
the
bank
she
was
considered
innocent
and
was
forthwith
allowed
to
return
to
her
household
completely
vindicated
it
will
have
been
seen
that
the
duty
of
chastity
on
the
part
of
a
married
woman
was
strictly
enforced
but
the
responsibility
to
properly
maintain
his
wife
was
also
recognized
and
in
the
event
of
his
desertion
she
could
under
certain
circumstances
become
the
wife
of
another
man
thus
if
he
left
his
city
and
fled
from
it
of
his
own
free
will
and
deserted
his
wife
he
could
not
reclaim
her
on
his
return
since
he
had
not
been
forced
to
leave
the
city
but
had
done
so
because
he
hated
it
this
rule
did
not
apply
to
the
case
of
a
man
who
was
taken
captive
in
battle
in
such
circumstances
the
action
was
to
be
guided
by
the
condition
of
her
affairs
if
the
captive
husband
possessed
sufficient
property
on
which
his
wife
could
be
maintained
during
his
captivity
in
a
strange
land
she
had
no
reason
nor
excuse
for
seeking
another
marriage
if
under
these
circumstances
she
became
another
wife
she
was
to
be
prosecuted
at
law
and
her
action
being
the
equivalent
of
adultery
she
was
to
be
drowned
but
the
case
was
regarded
as
altered
if
the
captive
husband
had
not
sufficient
means
for
the
maintenance
of
his
wife
during
his
absence
the
woman
would
then
be
thrown
on
her
own
resources
and
if
she
became
the
wife
of
another
man
she
incurred
no
blame
on
the
return
of
the
captive
he
could
reclaim
his
wife
but
the
children
of
the
second
marriage
would
remain
with
their
own
father
these
regulations
for
the
conduct
of
a
woman
whose
husband
was
captured
in
battle
give
an
intimate
picture
of
the
manner
in
which
the
constant
wars
of
this
early
period
affected
the
lives
of
those
who
took
part
in
them
under
the
babylonians
at
the
period
of
the
first
dynasty
divorce
was
strictly
regulated
though
it
was
far
easier
for
the
man
to
obtain
one
than
for
the
woman
if
we
may
regard
the
copies
of
sumerian
laws
which
have
come
down
to
us
from
the
late
assyrian
period
as
parts
of
the
code
in
use
under
the
early
sumerians
we
must
conclude
that
at
this
earlier
period
the
law
was
still
more
in
favour
of
the
husband
who
could
divorce
his
wife
whenever
he
so
desired
merely
paying
her
half
a
mana
as
compensation
under
the
sumerians
the
wife
could
not
obtain
a
divorce
at
all
and
the
penalty
for
denying
her
husband
was
death
these
regulations
were
modified
in
favour
of
the
woman
in
code
for
under
its
provisions
if
a
man
divorced
his
wife
or
his
concubine
he
was
obliged
to
make
proper
provision
for
her
maintenance
whether
she
were
barren
or
had
borne
him
children
he
was
obliged
to
return
her
marriage
portion
and
in
the
latter
case
she
had
the
custody
of
the
children
for
whose
maintenance
and
education
he
was
obliged
to
furnish
the
necessary
supplies
moreover
at
the
death
she
and
her
children
would
inherit
a
share
of
his
property
when
there
had
been
no
marriage
portion
a
sum
was
fixed
which
the
husband
was
obliged
to
pay
to
his
divorced
wife
according
to
his
status
in
cases
where
the
wife
was
proved
to
have
wasted
her
household
and
to
have
entirely
failed
in
her
duty
her
husband
could
divorce
her
without
paying
any
compensation
or
could
make
her
a
slave
in
his
house
and
the
extreme
penalty
for
this
offence
was
death
on
the
other
hand
a
woman
could
not
be
divorced
because
she
had
contracted
a
permanent
disease
and
if
she
desired
to
divorce
her
husband
and
could
prove
that
her
past
life
had
been
seemly
she
could
do
so
returning
to
her
house
and
taking
her
marriage
portion
with
her
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
go
very
minutely
into
the
regulations
given
by
the
code
with
regard
to
marriage
portions
the
rights
of
widows
the
laws
of
inheritance
and
the
laws
regulating
the
adoption
and
maintenance
of
children
the
customs
that
already
have
been
described
with
regard
to
marriage
and
divorce
may
serve
to
indicate
the
spirit
in
which
the
code
is
drawn
up
and
the
recognized
status
occupied
by
the
wife
in
the
babylonian
household
the
extremely
independent
position
enjoyed
by
women
in
the
early
babylonian
days
is
illustrated
by
the
existence
of
a
special
class
of
women
to
which
constant
reference
is
made
in
the
contracts
and
letters
of
the
period
when
the
existence
of
this
class
of
women
was
first
recognized
from
the
references
to
them
in
the
inscribed
at
the
time
of
the
first
dynasty
they
were
regarded
as
priestesses
but
the
regulations
concerning
them
which
occur
in
the
code
of
hammurabi
prove
that
their
duties
were
not
strictly
sacerdotal
but
that
they
occupied
the
position
of
votaries
the
majority
of
those
referred
to
in
the
inscriptions
of
this
period
were
vowed
to
the
service
of
the
temple
of
the
at
sippara
and
of
the
great
temple
of
marduk
at
babylon
but
it
is
probable
that
all
the
great
temples
in
the
country
had
classes
of
female
votaries
attached
to
them
from
the
evidence
at
present
available
it
may
be
concluded
that
the
functions
of
these
women
bore
no
resemblance
to
that
of
the
sacred
prostitutes
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
goddess
ishtar
in
the
city
of
erech
they
seem
to
have
occupied
a
position
of
great
influence
and
independence
in
the
community
and
their
duties
and
privileges
were
defined
and
safeguarded
by
special
legislation
generally
they
lived
together
in
a
special
building
or
convent
attached
to
the
temple
but
they
had
considerable
freedom
and
could
leave
the
convent
and
also
contract
marriage
their
vows
however
while
securing
them
special
privileges
entailed
corresponding
responsibilities
even
when
married
a
votary
was
still
obliged
to
remain
a
virgin
and
should
her
husband
desire
to
have
children
she
could
not
bear
them
herself
but
must
provide
him
with
a
maid
or
concubine
also
she
had
to
maintain
a
high
standard
of
moral
conduct
for
any
breach
of
which
severe
penalties
were
enforced
thus
if
a
votary
who
was
not
living
in
the
convent
opened
a
or
should
enter
one
for
drink
she
ran
the
risk
of
being
put
to
death
but
the
privileges
she
enjoyed
were
also
considerable
for
even
when
unmarried
she
enjoyed
the
status
of
a
married
woman
and
if
any
man
slandered
her
he
incurred
the
penalty
of
branding
on
the
forehead
moreover
a
married
votary
though
she
could
not
bear
her
husband
children
was
secured
in
her
position
as
the
permanent
head
of
his
household
the
concubine
she
might
give
to
her
husband
was
always
the
inferior
even
after
bearing
him
children
and
should
the
former
attempt
to
put
herself
on
a
level
of
equality
with
the
votary
the
latter
might
brand
her
as
a
slave
and
put
her
with
the
female
slaves
if
the
concubine
proved
barren
she
could
be
sold
the
votary
could
also
possess
property
and
on
taking
her
vows
was
provided
with
a
portion
by
her
father
exactly
as
though
she
were
being
given
in
marriage
her
portion
was
vested
in
herself
and
did
not
become
the
property
of
the
order
of
votaries
nor
of
the
temple
to
which
she
was
attached
the
proceeds
of
her
property
were
devoted
to
her
own
maintenance
and
on
her
death
her
brothers
looked
after
her
interests
or
she
might
farm
the
property
out
under
certain
circumstances
she
could
inherit
property
and
was
not
obliged
to
pay
taxes
on
it
and
such
property
she
could
bequeath
at
her
own
death
but
upon
her
death
her
portion
returned
to
her
own
family
unless
her
father
had
assigned
her
the
privilege
of
bequeathing
it
that
the
social
position
enjoyed
by
a
votary
was
considerable
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
many
women
of
good
family
and
even
members
of
the
royal
house
took
vows
the
existence
of
the
order
and
its
high
repute
indicate
a
very
advanced
conception
of
the
position
of
women
among
the
early
babylonians
from
the
code
of
hammurabi
we
also
gather
considerable
information
with
regard
to
the
various
classes
of
which
the
community
was
composed
and
to
their
relative
social
positions
for
the
purposes
of
legislation
the
community
was
divided
into
three
main
classes
or
sections
which
corresponded
to
strata
in
the
social
system
the
lowest
of
these
classes
consisted
of
the
slaves
who
must
have
formed
a
considerable
portion
of
the
population
the
class
next
above
them
comprised
the
large
body
of
free
men
who
were
possessed
of
a
certain
amount
of
property
but
were
poor
and
humble
as
their
name
implied
these
we
may
refer
to
as
the
middle
class
the
highest
or
upper
class
in
the
babylonian
community
embraced
all
the
officers
and
ministers
attached
to
the
court
the
higher
officials
and
servants
of
the
state
and
the
owners
of
considerable
lands
and
estates
the
differences
which
divided
and
marked
off
from
one
another
the
two
great
classes
of
free
men
in
the
population
of
babylonia
is
well
illustrated
by
the
scale
of
payments
as
compensation
for
injury
which
they
were
obliged
to
make
or
were
entitled
to
receive
thus
if
a
member
of
the
upper
class
were
guilty
of
stealing
an
ox
or
a
sheep
or
an
ass
or
a
pig
or
a
boat
from
a
temple
or
a
private
house
he
had
to
pay
the
owner
thirty
times
its
value
as
compensation
whereas
if
the
thief
were
a
member
of
the
middle
class
he
only
had
to
pay
ten
times
its
price
but
if
he
had
no
property
and
so
could
not
pay
compensation
he
was
put
to
death
the
penalty
for
manslaughter
was
less
if
the
assailant
was
a
man
of
the
middle
class
and
such
a
man
could
also
divorce
his
wife
more
cheaply
and
was
privileged
to
pay
his
doctor
or
surgeon
a
smaller
fee
for
a
successful
operation
but
the
privileges
enjoyed
by
a
man
of
the
middle
class
were
counterbalanced
by
a
corresponding
diminution
of
the
value
at
which
his
life
and
limbs
were
assessed
thus
if
a
doctor
by
carrying
out
an
operation
unskilfully
caused
the
death
of
a
member
of
the
upper
class
or
inflicted
a
serious
injury
upon
him
such
as
the
loss
of
an
eye
the
punishment
was
the
amputation
of
both
hands
but
no
such
penalty
seems
to
have
been
exacted
if
the
patient
were
a
member
of
the
middle
class
if
however
the
patient
were
a
slave
of
a
member
of
the
middle
class
in
the
event
of
death
under
the
operation
the
doctor
had
to
give
the
owner
another
slave
and
in
the
event
of
the
slave
losing
his
eye
he
had
to
pay
the
owner
half
the
value
penalties
for
assault
were
also
regulated
in
accordance
with
the
social
position
and
standing
of
the
parties
to
the
quarrel
thus
if
one
member
of
the
upper
class
knocked
out
the
eye
or
the
tooth
of
one
of
his
equals
his
own
eye
or
his
own
tooth
was
knocked
out
as
a
punishment
and
if
he
broke
the
limb
of
one
of
the
members
of
his
own
class
he
had
his
corresponding
limb
broken
but
if
he
knocked
out
the
eye
of
a
member
of
the
middle
class
or
broke
his
limb
he
suffered
no
punishment
in
his
own
person
but
was
fined
one
mana
of
silver
and
for
knocking
out
the
tooth
of
such
a
man
he
was
fined
of
a
mana
if
two
members
of
the
same
class
were
engaged
in
a
quarrel
and
one
of
them
made
a
peculiarly
improper
assault
upon
the
other
the
assailant
was
only
fined
the
fine
being
larger
if
the
quarrel
was
between
members
of
the
upper
class
but
if
such
an
assault
was
made
by
one
man
upon
another
who
was
of
higher
rank
than
himself
the
assailant
was
punished
by
being
publicly
beaten
in
the
presence
of
the
assembly
when
he
received
sixty
stripes
from
a
scourge
of
these
regulations
show
the
privileges
and
responsibilities
which
pertained
to
the
two
classes
of
free
men
in
the
babylonian
community
and
they
indicate
the
relative
social
positions
which
they
enjoyed
both
classes
of
free
men
could
own
slaves
though
it
is
obvious
that
they
were
more
numerous
in
the
households
and
on
the
estates
of
members
of
the
upper
class
the
slave
was
the
absolute
property
of
his
master
and
could
be
bought
and
sold
and
employed
as
a
deposit
for
a
debt
but
though
slaves
as
a
class
had
few
rights
of
their
own
in
certain
circumstances
they
could
acquire
them
thus
if
the
owner
of
a
female
slave
had
begotten
children
by
her
he
could
not
use
her
as
the
payment
for
a
debt
and
in
the
event
of
his
having
done
so
he
was
obliged
to
ransom
her
by
paying
the
original
amount
of
the
debt
in
money
it
was
also
possible
for
a
male
slave
whether
owned
by
a
member
of
the
upper
or
of
the
middle
class
to
marry
a
free
woman
and
if
he
did
so
his
children
were
free
and
did
not
become
the
property
of
his
master
also
if
the
free
woman
whom
the
slave
married
brought
with
her
a
marriage
portion
from
her
house
this
remained
her
own
property
on
the
death
and
supposing
the
couple
had
acquired
other
property
during
the
time
they
lived
together
as
man
and
wife
the
owner
of
the
slave
could
only
claim
half
of
such
property
the
other
half
being
retained
by
the
free
woman
for
her
own
use
and
for
that
of
her
children
generally
speaking
the
lot
of
the
slave
was
not
a
particularly
hard
one
for
he
was
a
recognized
member
of
his
household
and
as
a
valuable
piece
of
property
it
was
obviously
to
his
interest
to
keep
him
healthy
and
in
good
condition
in
fact
the
value
of
the
slave
is
attested
by
the
severity
of
the
penalty
imposed
for
abducting
a
male
or
female
slave
from
the
house
and
removing
him
or
her
from
the
city
for
a
man
guilty
of
this
offence
was
put
to
death
the
same
penalty
was
imposed
for
harbouring
and
taking
possession
of
a
runaway
slave
whereas
a
fixed
reward
was
paid
by
the
owner
to
any
one
by
whom
a
runaway
slave
was
captured
and
brought
back
special
legislation
was
also
devised
with
the
object
of
rendering
the
theft
of
slaves
difficult
and
their
detection
easy
thus
if
a
brander
put
a
mark
upon
a
slave
without
the
consent
he
was
liable
to
have
his
hands
cut
off
and
if
he
could
prove
that
he
did
so
through
being
deceived
by
another
man
that
man
was
put
to
death
for
bad
offences
slaves
were
liable
to
severe
punishments
such
as
cutting
off
the
ear
which
was
the
penalty
for
denying
his
master
and
also
for
making
an
aggravated
assault
on
a
member
of
the
upper
class
of
free
men
but
it
is
clear
that
on
the
whole
the
slave
was
well
looked
after
he
was
also
not
condemned
to
remain
perpetually
a
slave
for
while
still
in
his
service
it
was
possible
for
him
under
certain
conditions
to
acquire
property
of
his
own
and
if
he
did
so
he
was
able
with
his
consent
to
purchase
his
freedom
if
a
slave
were
captured
by
the
enemy
and
taken
to
a
foreign
land
and
sold
and
were
then
brought
back
by
his
new
owner
to
his
own
country
he
could
claim
his
liberty
without
having
to
pay
any
to
either
of
his
masters
the
code
of
hammurabi
also
contains
detailed
regulations
concerning
the
duties
of
debtors
and
creditors
and
it
throws
an
interesting
light
on
the
commercial
life
of
the
babylonians
at
this
early
period
for
instance
it
reveals
the
method
by
which
a
wealthy
man
or
a
merchant
extended
his
business
and
obtained
large
profits
by
trading
with
other
towns
this
he
did
by
employing
agents
who
were
under
certain
fixed
obligations
to
him
but
acted
independently
so
far
as
their
trading
was
concerned
from
the
merchant
these
agents
would
receive
money
or
grain
or
wool
or
oil
or
any
sort
of
goods
wherewith
to
trade
and
in
return
they
paid
a
fixed
share
of
their
profits
retaining
the
remainder
as
the
recompense
for
their
own
services
they
were
thus
the
earliest
of
commercial
travellers
in
order
to
prevent
fraud
between
the
merchant
and
the
agent
special
regulations
were
framed
for
the
dealings
they
had
with
one
another
thus
when
the
agent
received
from
the
merchant
the
money
or
goods
to
trade
with
it
was
enacted
that
he
should
at
the
time
of
the
transaction
give
a
properly
executed
receipt
for
the
amount
he
had
received
similarly
if
the
agent
gave
the
merchant
money
in
return
for
the
goods
he
had
received
and
in
token
of
his
good
faith
the
merchant
had
to
give
a
receipt
to
the
agent
and
in
reckoning
their
accounts
after
the
return
from
his
journey
only
such
amounts
as
were
specified
in
the
receipts
were
to
be
regarded
as
legal
obligations
if
the
agent
forgot
to
obtain
his
proper
receipt
he
did
so
at
his
own
risk
illustration

contract
tablet

dating
from
the
period
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
travelling
at
this
period
was
attended
with
some
risk
as
it
is
in
the
east
at
the
present
day
and
the
caravan
with
which
an
agent
travelled
was
liable
to
attack
from
brigands
or
it
might
be
captured
by
enemies
of
the
country
from
which
it
set
out
it
was
right
that
loss
from
this
cause
should
not
be
borne
by
the
agent
who
by
trading
with
the
goods
was
risking
his
own
life
but
should
fall
upon
the
merchant
who
had
merely
advanced
the
goods
and
was
safe
in
his
own
city
it
is
plain
however
that
disputes
frequently
arose
in
consequence
of
the
loss
of
goods
through
a
caravan
being
attacked
and
robbed
for
the
code
states
clearly
the
responsibility
of
the
merchant
in
the
matter
if
in
the
course
of
his
journey
an
enemy
had
forced
the
agent
to
give
up
some
of
the
goods
he
was
carrying
on
his
return
the
agent
had
to
specify
the
amount
on
oath
and
he
was
then
acquitted
of
all
responsibility
in
the
matter
if
he
attempted
to
cheat
his
employer
by
misappropriating
the
money
or
goods
advanced
to
him
on
being
convicted
of
the
offence
before
the
elders
of
the
city
he
was
obliged
to
repay
the
merchant
three
times
the
amount
he
had
taken
on
the
other
hand
if
the
merchant
attempted
to
defraud
his
agent
by
denying
that
the
due
amount
had
been
returned
to
him
he
was
obliged
on
conviction
to
pay
the
agent
six
times
the
amount
as
compensation
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
the
law
sought
to
protect
the
agent
from
the
risk
of
being
robbed
by
his
more
powerful
employer
the
merchant
sometimes
furnished
the
agent
with
goods
which
he
was
to
dispose
of
in
the
best
markets
he
could
find
in
the
cities
and
towns
along
his
route
and
sometimes
he
would
give
the
agent
money
with
which
to
purchase
goods
in
foreign
cities
for
sale
on
his
return
if
the
venture
proved
successful
the
merchant
and
his
agent
shared
the
profits
between
them
but
if
the
agent
made
bad
bargains
he
had
to
refund
to
the
merchant
the
value
of
the
goods
he
had
received
if
the
merchant
had
not
agreed
to
risk
losing
any
profit
the
amount
to
be
refunded
to
him
was
fixed
at
double
the
value
of
the
goods
advanced
illustration

this
last
enactment
gives
an
indication
of
the
immense
profits
which
were
obtained
by
both
the
merchant
and
the
agent
from
this
system
of
foreign
trade
for
it
is
clear
that
what
was
regarded
fair
profit
for
the
merchant
was
double
the
value
of
the
goods
disposed
of
the
profits
of
a
successful
journey
would
also
include
a
fair
return
to
the
agent
for
the
trouble
and
time
involved
in
his
undertaking
many
of
the
contract
tablets
of
this
early
period
relate
to
such
commercial
journeys
which
show
that
various
bargains
were
made
between
the
different
parties
interested
and
sometimes
such
contracts
or
partnerships
were
entered
into
not
for
a
single
journey
only
but
for
long
periods
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
at
the
time
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
and
probably
for
long
centuries
before
that
period
the
great
of
the
east
were
crowded
with
traffic
with
the
exception
that
donkeys
and
asses
were
employed
for
beasts
of
burden
and
were
not
supplemented
by
horses
and
camels
until
a
much
later
period
a
in
the
desert
on
one
of
the
great
must
have
presented
a
scene
similar
to
that
of
a

may
be
used
to
illustrate
the

of
an
early
babylonian
caravan

the
period
the

have
resembled

their
flat
mud
tops
on
which
the
inmates
sleep
at
night

the
hot
season
supported

poles
and

the
code
furnishes
evidence
that
at
that
time
also
the
houses
were
not
particularly
well
built
and
were
liable
to
fall
and
in
the
event
of
their
doing
so
it
very
justly
fixes
the
responsibility
upon
the
builder
it
is
clear
from
the
penalties
for
bad
workmanship
enforced
upon
the
builder
that
considerable
abuses
had
existed
in
the
trade
before
the
time
of
hammurabi
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
enforcement
of
the
penalties
succeeded
in
stamping
them
out
thus
if
a
builder
built
a
house
for
a
man
and
his
work
was
not
sound
and
the
house
fell
and
crushed
the
owner
so
that
he
died
it
was
enacted
that
the
builder
himself
should
be
put
to
death
if
the
fall
of
the
house
killed

son
the
own
son
was
to
be
put

any

from
the

be
made
good

in

period

was

which
may
be
distinguished
in

are
very
similar
in
form
and
construction
to
those
employed
by
the
ancient
assyrians
and
babylonians
from
the
code
of
hammurabi
we
also
gain
considerable
information
with
regard
to
agricultural
pursuits
in
ancient
babylonia
for
elaborate
regulations
are
given
concerning
the
duties
and
responsibilities
and
his
relations
to
his
tenants
the
usual
practice
in
hiring
land
for
cultivation
was
for
the
tenant
to
pay
his
rent
in
kind
by
assigning
a
certain
proportion
of
the
crop
generally
a
third
or
a
half
to
the
owner
if
a
tenant
hired
certain
land
for
cultivation
he
was
bound
to
till
it
and
raise
a
crop
and
should
he
neglect
to
do
so
he
had
to
pay
the
owner
what
was
reckoned
as
the
average
rent
of
the
land
and
he
had
also
to
break
up
the
land
and
plough
it
before
handing
it
back
as
the
rent
of
a
field
was
usually
reckoned
at
harvest
and
its
amount
depended
on
the
size
of
the
crop
it
was
only
fair
that
damage
to
the
crop
from
flood
or
storm
should
not
be
made
up
by
the
tenant
thus
it
was
enacted
by
the
code
that
any
loss
from
such
a
cause
should
be
shared
equally
by
the
owner
of
the
field
and
the
farmer
though
if
the
latter
had
already
paid
his
rent
at
the
time
the
damage
occurred
he
could
not
make
a
claim
for
repayment

the
roofed
houses
of
the
modern
dwellers
on
the
mound
can
be
well
seen
in
the
picture
it
is
clear
from
the
enactments
of
the
code
that
disputes
were
frequent
not
only
between
farmers
and
landowners
but
also
between
farmers
and
shepherds
it
is
certain
that
the
latter
in
the
attempt
to
find
pasture
for
the
flocks
often
allowed
their
sheep
to
feed
off
the
fields
in
the
spring
this
practice
the
code
set
itself
to
prevent
by
fixing
a
scale
of
compensation
to
be
paid
by
any
shepherd
who
caused
his
sheep
to
graze
on
cultivated
land
without
the
consent
if
the
offence
was
committed
in
the
early
spring
when
the
crop
was
still
small
the
farmer
was
to
harvest
the
crop
and
receive
a
considerable
price
in
kind
as
compensation
for
the
shepherd
but
if
it
occurred
later
on
in
the
spring
when
the
sheep
had
been
brought
in
from
the
meadows
and
turned
into
the
great
common
field
at
the
city
gate
the
offence
would
less
probably
be
due
to
accident
and
the
damage
to
the
crop
would
be
greater
in
these
circumstances
the
shepherd
had
to
take
over
the
crop
and
pay
the
farmer
very
heavily
for
his
loss

from

in
the
british
museum
the
planting
of
gardens
and
orchards
was
encouraged
and
a
man
was
allowed
to
use
a
field
for
this
purpose
without
paying
a
yearly
rent
he
might
plant
it
and
tend
it
for
four
years
and
in
the
fifth
year
of
his
tenancy
the
original
owner
of
the
field
took
half
of
the
garden
in
payment
while
the
other
half
the
planter
of
the
garden
kept
for
himself
if
a
bare
patch
had
been
left
in
the
garden
it
was
to
be
reckoned
in
the
half
regulations
were
framed
to
ensure
the
proper
carrying
out
of
the
planting
for
if
the
tenant
neglected
to
do
this
during
the
first
four
years
he
was
still
liable
to
plant
the
plot
he
had
taken
without
receiving
his
half
and
he
had
to
pay
the
owner
compensation
in
addition
which
varied
in
amount
according
to
the
original
condition
of
the
land
if
a
man
hired
a
garden
the
rent
he
paid
to
the
owner
was
fixed
at
of
its
produce
detailed
regulations
are

concerning
the
hire
of
cattle
and
asses
and
the
compensation
to
be
paid
to
the
owner
for
the
loss
or
of
his
beasts
these
are
framed
on
the
just
principle
that
the
hirer
was
responsible
only
for
damage
or
loss
which
he
could
have
reasonably
prevented
thus
if
a
lion
killed
a
hired
ox
or
ass
in
the
open
country
or
if
an
ox
was
killed
by
lightning
the
loss
fell
upon
the
owner
and
not
on
the
man
who
hired
the
beast
but
if
the
hirer
killed
the
ox
through
carelessness
or
by
beating
it
unmercifully
or
if
the
beast
broke
its
leg
while
in
his
charge
he
had
to
restore
another
ox
to
the
owner
in
place
of
the
one
he
had
hired
for
lesser
damages
to
the
beast
the
hirer
had
to
pay
compensation
on
a
fixed
scale
thus
if
the
ox
had
its
eye
knocked
out
during
the
period
of
its
hire
the
man
who
hired
it
had
to
pay
to
the
owner
half
its
value
while
for
a
broken
horn
the
loss
of
the
tail
or
a
torn
muzzle
he
paid
a
quarter
of
the
value
of
the
beast
fines
were
also
levied
for
carelessness
in
looking
after
cattle
though
in
cases
of
damage
or
injury
where
carelessness
could
not
be
proved
the
owner
of
a
beast
was
not
held
responsible
a
bull
might
go
wild
at
any
time
and
gore
a
man
however
careful
and
conscientious
the
owner
might
be
and
in
these
circumstances
the
injured
man
could
not
bring
an
action
against
the
owner
but
if
a
bull
had
already
gored
a
man
and
although
it
was
known
to
be
vicious
the
owner
had
not
blunted
its
horns
or
shut
it
up
in
the
event
of
its
goring
and
killing
a

he

inflicted
severe
fines
for
acts
of
dishonesty
with
regard
to
the
cattle
provender
or
committed
to
their
charge
if
a
man
stole
the
provender
for
the
cattle
he
had
to
make
it
good
and
he
was
also
liable
to
the
punishment
of
having
his
hands
cut
off
in
the
event
of
his
being
convicted
of
letting
out
the
oxen
for
hire
or
stealing
the
so
that
he
did
not
produce
a
crop
he
had
to
pay
very
heavy
compensation
and
if
he
could
not
pay
he
was
liable
to
be
torn
to
pieces
by
the
oxen
in
the
field
he
should
have
cultivated
in
a
dry
land
like
babylonia
where
little
rain
falls
and
that
in
only
one
season
of
the
year
the
irrigation
of
his
fields
forms
one
of
the
most
important
duties
of
the
agriculturist
the
farmer
leads
the
water
to
his
fields
along
small
or
channels
above
the
level
of
the
soil
their
sides
being
formed
of
banks
of
earth
it
is
clear
that
similar
methods
were
employed
by
the
early
babylonians
one
such
channel
might
supply
the
fields
of
several
farmers
and
it
was
the
duty
of
each
man
through
whose
land
the
channel
flowed
to
keep
its
banks
on
his
land
in
repair
if
he
omitted
to
strengthen
his
bank
or
dyke
and
the
water
forced
a
breach
and
flooded
his
field
he
had
to
pay
compensation
in
kind
for
any
crop
that
was
ruined
while
if
he
could
not
pay
he
and
his
goods
were
sold
and
his
neighbours
whose
fields
had
been
damaged
through
his
carelessness
shared
the
money
the
land
of
babylonian
farmers
was
prepared
for
irrigation
before
it
was
sown
by
being
divided
into
a
number
of
small
square
or
oblong
tracts
each
separated
from
the
others
by
a
low
bank
of
earth
the
seed
being
afterwards
sown
within
the
small
squares
or
patches
some
of
the
banks
running
lengthwise
through
the
field
were
made
into
small
channels
the
ends
of
which
were
carried
up
to
the
bank
of
the
nearest
main
irrigation
canal
no
system
of
gates
or
sluices
was
employed
and
when
the
farmer
wished
to
water
one
of
his
fields
he
simply
broke
away
the
bank
opposite
one
of
his
small
channels
and
let
the
water
flow
into
it
he
would
let
the
water
run
along
this
small
channel
until
it
reached
the
part
of
his
land
he
wished
to
water
he
then
blocked
the
channel
with
a
little
earth
at
the
same
time
breaking
down
its
bank
so
that
the
water
flowed
over
one
of
the
small
squares
and
thoroughly
soaked
it
when
this
square
was
finished
he
filled
up
the
bank
and
repeated
the
process
for
the
next
square
and
so
on
until
he
had
watered
the
necessary
portion
of
the
field
when
this
was
finished
he
returned
to
the
main
channel
and
stopped
the
flow
of
the
water
by
blocking
up
the
hole
he
had
made
in
the
dyke
the
whole
process
was
and
still
is
extremely
simple
but
it
needs
care
and
vigilance
especially
in
the
case
of
extensive
irrigation
when
water
is
being
carried
into
several
parts
of
an
estate
at
once
it
will
be
obvious
that
any
carelessness
on
the
part
of
the
irrigator
in
not
shutting
off
the
water
in
time
may
lead
to
extensive
damage
not
only
to
his
own
fields
but
to
those
of
his
neighbours
in
the
early
babylonian
period
if
a
farmer
left
the
water
running
in
his
channel
and
it
flooded
his
field
and
hurt
his
crop
he
had
to
pay
compensation
according
to
the
amount
of
damage
done
it
was
stated
above
that
the
and
little
channels
were
made
above
the
level
of
the
soil
so
that
the
water
could
at
any
point
be
tapped
and
allowed
to
flow
over
the
surrounding
land
and
in
a
flat
country
like
babylonia
it
will
be
obvious
that
some
means
had
to
be
employed
for
raising
the
water
from
its
natural
level
to
the
higher
level
of
the
land
as
we
should
expect
reference
is
made
in
the
babylonian
inscriptions
to
and
although
their
exact
form
and
construction
are
not
described
they
must
have
been
very
similar
to
those
employed
at
the
present
day
the
modern
inhabitants
of
mesopotamia
employ
four
sorts
of
contrivances
for
raising
the
water
into
their
three
of
these
are
quite
primitive
and
are
those
most
commonly
employed
the
method
which
gives
the
least
trouble
and
which
is
used
wherever
the
conditions
allow
is
a
primitive
form
of
this
can
be
used
only
in
a
river
with
a
good
current
the
wheel
is
formed
of
rough
boughs
and
branches
nailed
together
with
spokes
joining
the
outer
rims
to
a
roughly
hewn
axle
a
row
of
rough
earthenware
cups
or
bottles
are
tied
round
the
outer
rim
for
picking
up
the
water
and
a
few
rough
paddles
are
fixed
so
that
they
stick
out
beyond
the
rim
the
wheel
is
then
fixed
in
place
near
the
bank
of
the
river
its
axle
resting
in
pillars
of
rough
masonry
illustration
a
modern
machine
for
irrigation
on
the
euphrates
as
the
current
turns
the
wheel
the
bottles
on
the
rim
dip
below
the
surface
and
are
raised
up
full
at
the
top
of
the
wheel
is
fixed
a
trough
made
by
hollowing
half
the
trunk
of
a
and
into
this
the
bottles
pour
their
water
which
is
conducted
from
the
trough
by
means
of
a
small
aqueduct
into
the
on
the
bank
the
convenience
of
the
will
be
obvious
for
the
water
is
raised
without
the
labour
of
man
or
beast
and
a
constant
supply
is
secured
day
and
night
so
long
as
the
current
is
strong
enough
to
turn
the
wheel
the
water
can
be
cut
off
by
blocking
the
wheel
or
tying
it
up
these
wheels
are
most
common
on
the
euphrates
and
are
usually
set
up
where
there
is
a
slight
drop
in
the
river
bed
and
the
water
runs
swiftly
over
shallows
as
the
banks
are
very
high
the
wheels
are
necessarily
huge
contrivances
in
order
to
reach
the
level
of
the
fields
and
their
very
rough
construction
causes
them
to
creak
and
groan
as
they
turn
with
the
current
in
a
convenient
place
in
the
river
several
of
these
are
sometimes
set
up
side
by
side
and
the
noise
of
their
combined
creakings
can
be
heard
from
a
great
distance
some
idea
of
what
one
of
these
machines
looks
like
can
be
obtained
from
the
illustration
at
hit
on
the
euphrates
a
line
of
gigantic
is
built
across
the
river
and
the
noise
they
make
is
extraordinary
where
there
is
no
current
to
turn
one
of
these
wheels
or
where
the
bank
is
too
high
the
water
must
be
raised
by
the
labour
of
man
or
beast
the
commonest
method
which
is
the
one
employed
generally
on
the
tigris
is
to
raise
it
in
skins
which
are
drawn
up
by
horses
donkeys
or
cattle
a
recess
with
perpendicular
sides
is
cut
into
the
bank
and
a
wooden
spindle
on
wooden
struts
is
supported
horizontally
over
the
recess
a
rope
running
over
the
spindle
is
fastened
to
the
skin
while
the
funnel
end
of
the
skin
is
held
up
by
a
second
rope
running
over
a
lower
spindle
until
its
mouth
is
opposite
the
trough
into
which
the
water
is
to
be
poured
the
beasts
which
are
employed
for
raising
the
skin
are
fastened
to
the
ends
of
the
ropes
and
they
get
a
good
purchase
for
their
pull
by
being
driven
down
a
short
cutting
or
inclined
plane
in
the
bank
to
get
a
constant
flow
of
water
two
skins
are
usually
employed
and
as
one
is
drawn
up
full
the
other
is
let
down
empty
the
third
primitive
method
of
raising
water
which
is
commoner
in
egypt
than
in
mesopotamia
at
the
present
day
is
the
and
is
worked
by
hand
it
consists
of
a
beam
supported
in
the
centre
at
one
end
of
which
is
tied
a
rope
with
a
bucket
or
vessel
for
raising
the
water
and
at
the
other
end
is
fixed
a
counterweight
on
an
assyrian
found
at
kuyunjik
are
representations
of
the
shadduf
in
operation
two
of
them
being
used
the
one
above
the
other
to
raise
the
water
to
successive
levels
these
were
probably
the
contrivances
usually
employed
by
the
early
babylonians
for
raising
the
water
to
the
level
of
their
fields
and
the
fact
that
they
were
light
and
easily
removed
must
have
made
them
tempting
objects
to
the
dishonest
farmer
hammurabi
therefore
fixed
a
scale
of
compensation
to
be
paid
to
the
owner
by
a
detected
thief
which
varied
according
to
the
class
and
value
of
the
machine
he
stole
the
rivers
and
larger
canals
of
babylonia
were
used
by
the
ancient
inhabitants
not
only
for
the
irrigation
of
their
fields
but
also
as
waterways
for
the
transport
of
heavy
materials
the
recently
published
letters
of
hammurabi
and
contain
directions
for
the
transportation
of
corn
dates
sesame
seed
and
wood
which
were
ordered
to
be
brought
in
ships
to
babylon
and
the
code
of
hammurabi
refers
to
the
transportation
by
water
of
wool
and
oil
it
is
therefore
clear
that
at
this
period
considerable
use
was
made
of
vessels
of
different
size
for
conveying
supplies
in
bulk
by
water
the
method
by
which
the
size
of
such
ships
and
barges
was
reckoned
was
based
on
the
amount
of
grain
they
were
capable
of
carrying
and
this
was
measured
by
the
the
largest
measure
of
capacity
thus
mention
is
made
in
the
inscriptions
of
vessels
of
five
ten
fifteen
twenty
thirty
forty
fifty
sixty
and
gur
capacity
a
fee
for
building
a
vessel
of
sixty
gur
was
fixed
at
two
shekels
of
silver
and
it
was
proportionately
less
for
boats
of
smaller
capacity
to
ensure
that
the
should
not
scamp
his
work
regulations
were
drawn
up
to
fix
on
him
the
responsibility
for
unsound
work
thus
if
a
were
employed
to
build
a
vessel
and
he
put
faulty
work
into
its
construction
so
that
it
developed
defects
within
a
year
of
its
being
launched
he
was
obliged
to
strengthen
and
rebuild
it
at
his
own
expense
the
fourth
class
of
machine
for
raising
water
employed
in
mesopotamia
at
the
present
day
consists
of
an
endless
chain
of
iron
buckets
running
over
a
wheel
this
is
geared
by
means
of
rough
wooden
cogs
to
a
horizontal
wheel
the
spindle
of
which
has
long
poles
fixed
to
it
to
which
horses
or
cattle
are
harnessed
the
beasts
go
round
in
a
circle
and
so
turn
the
machine
the
contrivance
is
not
so
primitive
as
the
three
described
above
and
the
iron
buckets
are
of
european
importation
the
hire
of
a
boatman
was
fixed
at
six
gur
of
corn
to
be
paid
him
yearly
but
it
is
clear
that
some
of
the
larger
vessels
carried
crews
commanded
by
a
chief
boatman
or
captain
whose
pay
was
probably
on
a
larger
scale
if
a
man
let
his
boat
to
a
boatman
the
latter
was
responsible
for
losing
or
sinking
it
and
he
had
to
replace
it
a
boatman
was
also
responsible
for
the
safety
of
his
vessel
and
of
any
goods
such
as
corn
wool
oil
or
dates
which
he
had
been
hired
to
transport
and
if
they
were
sunk
through
his
carelessness
he
had
to
make
good
the
loss
if
he
succeeded
in
refloating
the
boat
after
it
had
been
sunk
he
was
only
under
obligation
to
pay
the
owner
half
its
value
in
compensation
for
the
damage
it
had
sustained
in
the
case
of
a
collision
between
two
vessels
if
one
was
at
anchor
at
the
time
the
owner
of
the
other
vessel
had
to
pay
compensation
for
the
boat
that
was
sunk
and
its
cargo
the
owner
of
the
latter
estimating
on
oath
the
value
of
what
had
been
sunk
boats
were
also
employed
as
ferries
and
they
must
have
resembled
the
primitive
form
of
in
use
at
the
present
day
which
is
heavily
built
of
huge
timbers
and
employed
for
transporting
beasts
as

as

is

that
under
the
assyrians
rafts
floated
on
inflated
skins
were
employed
for
the
transport
of
heavy
goods
and
these
have
survived
in
the
keleks

adapted

materials

that
such
rafts
were
employed
on
the
tigris

the
euphrates
from
the
earliest
periods
of
chaldæan
history
though
boats
would
have
been
used
on
the
canals
and
more
sluggish
waterways
in
the
preceding
pages
we
have
given
a
sketch
of
the
more
striking
aspects
of
early
babylonian
life
on
which
light
has
been
thrown
by
recently
discovered
documents
belonging
to
the
period
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
we
have
seen
that
in
the
code
of
laws
drawn
up
by
hammurabi
regulations
were
framed
for
settling
disputes
and
fixing
responsibilities
under
almost
every
condition
and
circumstance
which
might
arise
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
at
that
time
and
the
question
naturally
arises
as
to
how
far
the
code
of
laws
was
in
actual
operation

it
is
conceivable
that
the
king
may
have
held
admirable
convictions
but
have
been
possessed
of
little
power
to
carry
them
out
and
to
see
that
his
regulations
were
enforced
luckily
we
have
not
to
depend
on
conjecture
for
settling
the
question
for
own
letters
which
are
now
preserved
in
the
british
museum
afford
abundant
evidence
of
the
active
control
which
the
king
exercised
over
every
department
of
his
administration
and
in
every
province
of
his
empire
in
the
earlier
periods
of
history
when
each
city
lived
independently
of
its
neighbours
and
had
its
own
system
of
government
the
need
for
close
and
frequent
communication
between
them
was
not
pressing
but
this
became
apparent
as
soon
as
they
were
welded
together
and
formed
parts
of
an
extended
empire
thus
in
the
time
of
sargon

extensive

course
of
their
journeys
in
the
case
of
hammurabi
we
have
recovered
some
of
the
actual
letters
sent
by
the
king
himself
to
his
local
governor
in
the
city
of
larsam
and
from
them
we
gain
considerable
insight
into
the
principles
which
guided
him
in
the
administration
of
his
empire
the
letters
themselves
in
their
general
characteristics
resembled
the
contract
tablets
of
the
period
which
have
been
already
described
they
were
written
on
small
clay
tablets
oblong
in
shape
and
as
they
were
only
three
or
four
inches
long
they
could
easily
be
carried
about
the
person
of
the
messenger
into
whose
charge
they
were
delivered
after
the
tablet
was
written
it
was
enclosed
in
a
thin
envelope
of
clay
having
been
first
powdered
with
dry
clay
to
prevent
its
sticking
to
the
envelope
the
name
of
the
person
for
whom
the
letter
was
intended
was
written
on
the
outside
of
the
envelope
and
both
it
and
the
tablet
were
baked
hard
to
ensure
that
they
should
not
be
broken
on
their
travels
the
recipient
of
the
letter
on
its
being
delivered
to
him
broke
the
outer
envelope
by
tapping
it
sharply
and
it
then
fell
away
in
pieces
leaving
the
letter
and
its
message
exposed
the
envelopes
were
very
similar
to
those
in
which
the
contract
tablets
of
the
period
were
enclosed
of
which
illustrations
have
already
been
given
their
only
difference
being
that
the
text
of
the
tablet
was
not
repeated
on
the
envelope
as
was
the
case
with
the
former
class
of
documents
the
royal
letters
that
have
been
recovered
throw
little
light
on
military
affairs
and
the
prosecution
of
campaigns
for
being
addressed
to
governors
of
cities
and
civil
officials
most
of
them
deal
with
matters
affecting
the
internal
administration
of
the
empire
one
letter
indeed
contains
directions
concerning
the
movements
of
two
hundred
and
forty
soldiers
of
who
had
been
stationed
in
assyria
and
another
letter
mentions
certain
troops
who
were
quartered
in
the
city
of
ur
a
third
deals
with
the
supply
of
clothing
and
oil
for
a
section
of
the
babylonian
army
and
troops
are
also
mentioned
as
having
formed
the
escort
for
certain
goddesses
captured
from
the
elamites
while
directions
are
sent
to
others
engaged
in
a
campaign
upon
the
elamite
frontier
the
letter
which
contains
directions
for
the
safe
escort
of
the
captured
elamite
goddesses
and
the
one
ordering
the
return
of
these
same
goddesses
to
their
own
shrines
show
that
foreign
deities
even
when
captured
from
an
enemy
were
treated
by
the
babylonians
with
the
same
respect
and
reverence
that
was
shown
by
them
to
their
own
gods
and
goddesses
hammurabi
gave
directions
in
the
first
letter
for
the
conveyance
of
the
goddesses
to
babylon
with
all
due
pomp
and
ceremony
sheep
being
supplied
for
sacrifice
upon
the
journey
and
their
usual
rites
being
performed
by
their
own
and
priestesses
the
voluntary
restoration
of
the
goddesses
to
their
own
country
may
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
after
their
transference
to
babylon
the
army
of
the
babylonians
suffered
defeat
in
elam
this
misfortune
would
naturally
have
been
ascribed
by
the
king
and
the
priests
to
the
anger
of
the
elamite
goddesses
at
being
detained
in
a
foreign
land
and
hammurabi
probably
arrived
at
his
decision
that
they
should
be
escorted
back
in
the
hope
of
once
more
securing
victory
for
the
babylonian
arms
the
care
which
the
king
exercised
for
the
due
worship
of
his
own
gods
and
the
proper
supply
of
their
temples
is
well
illustrated
from
the
letters
that
have
been
recovered
for
he
superintended
the
collection
of
the
temple
revenues
and
the
herdsmen
and
shepherds
attached
to
the
service
of
the
gods
sent
their
reports
directly
to
him
he
also
took
care
that
the
observances
of
religious
rites
and
ceremonies
were
duly
carried
out
and
on
one
occasion
he
postponed
the
hearing
of
a
lawsuit
concerning
the
title
to
certain
property
which
was
in
dispute
as
it
would
have
interfered
with
the
proper
observance
of
a
festival
in
the
city
of
ur
the
plaintiff
in
the
suit
was
the
chief
of
the
temple
bakers
and
it
was
his
duty
to
superintend
the
preparation
of
certain
offerings
for
the
occasion
in
order
that
he
should
not
have
to
leave
his
duties
the
king
put
off
the
hearing
of
the
case
until
after
the
festival
had
been
duly
celebrated
the
king
also
exercised
a
strict
control
over
the
priests
themselves
and
received
reports
from
the
chief
priests
concerning
their
own
subordinates
and
it
is
probable
that
the
royal
sanction
was
obtained
for
all
the
principal
appointments
the
guild
of
soothsayers
was
an
important
religious
class
at
this
time
and
they
also
were
under
the
direct
control
a
letter
written
by
ammiditana
one
of
the
later
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
to
three
high
officials
of
the
city
of
sippar
contains
directions
with
regard
to
certain
duties
to
be
carried
out
by
the
soothsayers
attached
to
the
service
of
the
city
and
indicates
the
nature
of
their
functions
ammiditana
wrote
to
the
officials
in
question
stating
that
there
was
a
scarcity
of
corn
in
the
city
of
shagga
and
he
therefore
ordered
them
to
send
a
supply
thither
but
before
the
corn
was
brought
into
the
city
they
were
told
to
consult
the
soothsayers
who
were
to
divine
the
future
and
ascertain
whether
the
omens
were
favourable
if
they
proved
to
be
so
the
corn
was
to
be
brought
in
we
may
conjecture
that
the
king
took
this
precaution
as
he
feared
the
scarcity
of
corn
in
shagga
was
due
to
the
anger
of
some
local
deity
or
spirit
and
that
if
this
were
the
case
the
bringing
in
of
the
corn
would
only
lead
to
fresh
troubles
this
danger
it
was
the
duty
of
the
soothsayers
to
prevent
another
class
of
the
priesthood
which
we
may
infer
was
under
the
direct
control
was
the
astrologers
whose
duty
it
probably
was
to
make
reports
to
the
king
of
the
conjunctions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
with
a
view
to
ascertaining
whether
they
portended
good
or
evil
to
the
state
no
astrological
reports
written
in
this
early
period
have
been
recovered
but
at
a
later
period
under
the
assyrian
empire
the
astrologers
reported
regularly
to
the
king
on
such
matters
and
it
is
probable
that
the
practice
was
one
long
established
one
of
letters
proves
that
the
king
regulated
the
calendar
and
it
is
legitimate
to
suppose
that
he
sought
the
advice
of
his
astrologers
as
to
the
times
when
intercalary
months
were
to
be
inserted
the
letter
dealing
with
the
calendar
was
written
to
inform
the
governor
of
larsam
that
an
intercalary
month
was
to
be
inserted
the
year
the
calendar
hath
a
deficiency
he
writes
the
month
which
is
now
beginning
be
registered
as
a
second
elul
and
the
king
adds
that
this
insertion
of
an
extra
month
will
not
justify
any
postponement
in
the
payment
of
the
regular
tribute
due
from
the
city
of
larsam
which
had
to
be
paid
a
month
earlier
than
usual
to
make
up
for
the
month
that
was
inserted
the
intercalation
of
additional
months
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
babylonian
months
were
lunar
so
that
the
calendar
had
to
be
corrected
at
intervals
to
make
it
correspond
to
the
solar
year
from
the
description
already
given
of
the
code
of
laws
drawn
up
by
hammurabi
it
will
have
been
seen
that
the
king
attempted
to
incorporate
and
arrange
a
set
of
regulations
which
should
settle
any
dispute
likely
to
arise
with
regard
to
the
duties
and
privileges
of
all
classes
of
his
subjects
that
this
code
was
not
a
dead
letter
but
was
actively
administered
is
abundantly
proved
by
many
of
the
letters
of
hammurabi
which
have
been
recovered
from
these
we
learn
that
the
king
took
a
very
active
part
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
country
and
that
he
exercised
a
strict
supervision
not
only
over
the
cases
decided
in
the
capital
but
also
over
those
which
were
tried
in
the
other
great
cities
and
towns
of
babylonia
any
private
citizen
was
entitled
to
make
a
direct
appeal
to
the
king
for
justice
if
he
thought
he
could
not
obtain
it
in
his
local
court
and
it
is
clear
from
letters
that
he
always
listened
to
such
an
appeal
and
gave
it
adequate
consideration
the
king
was
anxious
to
stamp
out
all
corruption
on
the
part
of
those
who
were
invested
with
authority
and
he
had
no
mercy
on
any
of
his
officers
who
were
convicted
of
taking
bribes
on
one
occasion
when
he
had
been
informed
of
a
case
of
bribery
in
the
city
of
he
at
once
ordered
the
governor
of
the
district
in
which
lay
to
investigate
the
charge
and
send
to
babylon
those
who
were
proved
to
be
guilty
that
they
might
be
punished
he
also
ordered
that
the
bribe
should
be
confiscated
and
despatched
to
babylon
under
seal
a
wise
provision
which
must
have
tended
to
discourage
those
who
were
inclined
to
tamper
with
the
course
of
justice
while
at
the
same
time
it
enriched
the
state
it
is
probable
that
the
king
tried
all
cases
of
appeal
in
person
when
it
was
possible
to
do
so
but
if
the
litigants
lived
at
a
considerable
distance
from
babylon
he
gave
directions
to
his
local
officials
on
the
spot
to
try
the
case
when
he
was
convinced
of
the
justice
of
any
claim
he
would
decide
the
case
himself
and
send
instructions
to
the
local
authorities
to
see
that
his
decision
was
duly
carried
out
it
is
certain
that
many
disputes
arose
at
this
period
in
consequence
of
the
extortions
of
these
men
frequently
laid
claim
in
a
fraudulent
manner
to
fields
and
estates
which
they
had
received
in
pledge
as
security
for
advanced
by
them
in
cases
where
fraud
was
proved
hammurabi
had
no
mercy
and
summoned
the
to
babylon
to
receive
punishment
however
wealthy
and
powerful
he
might
be
a
subject
frequently
referred
to
in
letters
is
the
collection
of
revenues
and
it
is
clear
that
an
elaborate
system
was
in
force
throughout
the
country
for
the
levying
and
payment
of
tribute
to
the
state
by
the
principal
cities
of
babylonia
as
well
as
for
the
collection
of
rent
and
revenue
from
the
royal
estates
and
from
the
lands
which
were
set
apart
for
the
supply
of
the
great
temples
collectors
of
both
secular
and
religious
tribute
sent
reports
directly
to
the
king
and
if
there
was
any
deficit
in
the
supply
which
was
expected
from
a
collector
he
had
to
make
it
up
himself
but
the
king
was
always
ready
to
listen
to
and
investigate
a
complaint
and
to
enforce
the
payment
of
tribute
or
taxes
so
that
the
loss
should
not
fall
upon
the
collector
thus
in
one
of
his
letters
hammurabi
informs
the
governor
of
larsam
that
a
collector
named
had
reported
to
him
saying
hath
laid
hands
upon
the
money
for
the
temple
of
the
great
temple
of
the
at
larsam
which
is
due
from
the
city
of
and
from
the
region
round
about
the
tigris
and
he
hath
not
rendered
the
full
sum
and
hath
laid
hands
upon
the
money
for
the
temple
of
which
is
due
from
the
rakhabu
and
from
the
region
round
about
that
city
and
he
hath
not
paid
the
full
amount
but
the
palace
hath
exacted
the
full
sum
from
it
is
probable
that
both
and
were
for
we
know
from
another
letter
that
the
former
had
laid
claim
to
certain
property
on
which
he
had
held
a
mortgage
although
the
mortgage
had
been
redeemed
in
the
present
case
they
had
probably
lent
money
or
to
certain
cultivators
of
land
near
and
rakhabu
and
along
the
tigris
and
in
settlement
of
their
claims
they
had
seized
the
crops
and
had
moreover
refused
to
pay
to
the
officer
the
proportion
of
the
crops
that
was
due
to
the
state
as
taxes
upon
the
land
the
governor
of
larsam
the
principal
city
in
the
district
had
rightly
as
the
representative
of
the
palace
the
king
caused
the
to
make
up
the
deficiency
but
hammurabi
on
receiving
the
subordinate
complaint
referred
the
matter
back
to
the
governor
the
end
of
the
letter
is
wanting
but
we
may
infer
that
hammurabi
condemned
the
defaulting
to
pay
the
taxes
due
and
fined
them
in
addition
or
ordered
them
to
be
sent
to
the
capital
for
punishment
on
another
occasion
himself
and
a
second
named
appear
to
have
been
in
fault
and
to
have
evaded
coming
to
babylon
when
summoned
thither
by
the
king
it
had
been
their
duty
to
collect
large
quantities
of
sesame
seed
as
well
as
taxes
paid
in
money
when
first
summoned
they
had
made
the
excuse
that
it
was
the
time
of
harvest
and
they
would
come
after
the
harvest
was
over
but
as
they
did
not
then
make
their
appearance
hammurabi
wrote
an
urgent
letter
insisting
that
they
should
be
despatched
with
the
full
amount
of
the
taxes
due
in
the
company
of
a
trustworthy
officer
who
would
see
that
they
duly
arrived
at
the
capital
tribute
on
flocks
and
herds
was
also
levied
by
the
king
and
collectors
or
assessors
of
the
revenue
were
stationed
in
each
district
whose
duty
it
was
to
report
any
deficit
in
the
revenue
accounts
the
owners
of
flocks
and
herds
were
bound
to
bring
the
young
cattle
and
lambs
that
were
due
as
tribute
to
the
central
city
of
the
district
in
which
they
dwelt
and
they
were
then
collected
into
large
bodies
and
added
to
the
royal
flocks
and
herds
but
if
the
owners
attempted
to
hold
back
any
that
were
due
as
tribute
they
were
afterwards
forced
to
incur
the
extra
expense
and
trouble
of
driving
the
beasts
to
babylon
the
flocks
and
herds
owned
by
the
king
and
the
great
temples
were
probably
enormous
and
yielded
a
considerable
revenue
in
themselves
apart
from
the
tribute
and
taxes
due
from
private
owners
shepherds
and
herdsmen
were
placed
in
charge
of
them
and
they
were
divided
into
groups
under
chief
shepherds
who
arranged
the
districts
in
which
the
herds
and
flocks
were
to
be
grazed
distributing
them
when
possible
along
the
banks
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
rivers
and
canals
which
would
afford
good
pasturage
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
water
the
king
received
reports
from
the
chief
shepherds
and
herdsmen
and
it
was
the
duty
of
the
governors
of
the
chief
cities
and
districts
of
babylonia
to
make
tours
of
inspection
and
see
that
due
care
was
taken
of
the
royal
flocks
and
sheep
the
for
all
the
flocks
that
were
pastured
near
the
capital
took
place
in
babylon
and
the
king
used
to
send
out
summonses
to
his
chief
shepherds
to
inform
them
of
the
day
when
the
shearing
would
take
place
and
it
is
probable
that
the
governors
of
the
other
great
cities
sent
out
similar
orders
to
the
shepherds
of
flocks
under
their
charge
royal
and
priestly
flocks
were
often
under
the
same
chief
officer
a
fact
which
shows
the
very
strict
control
the
king
exercised
over
the
temple
revenues
the
interests
of
the
agricultural
population
were
strictly
looked
after
by
the
king
who
secured
a
proper
supply
of
water
for
purposes
of
irrigation
by
seeing
that
the
canals
and
waterways
were
kept
in
a
proper
state
of
repair
and
cleaned
out
at
regular
intervals
there
is
also
evidence
that
nearly
every
king
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
cut
new
canals
and
extended
the
system
of
irrigation
and
transportation
which
had
been
handed
down
to
him
from
his
fathers
the
draining
of
the
marshes
and
the
proper
repair
of
the
canals
could
only
be
carried
out
by
careful
and
continuous
supervision
and
it
was
the
duty
of
the
local
governors
to
see
that
the
inhabitants
of
villages
and
owners
of
land
situated
on
the
banks
of
a
canal
should
keep
it
in
proper
order
when
this
duty
had
been
neglected
complaints
were
often
sent
to
the
king
who
gave
orders
to
the
local
governor
to
remedy
the
defect
thus
on
one
occasion
it
had
been
ordered
that
a
canal
at
erech
which
had
silted
up
should
be
deepened
but
the
dredging
had
not
been
carried
out
thoroughly
so
that
the
bed
of
the
canal
soon
silted
up
again
and
boats
were
prevented
from
entering
the
city
in
these
circumstances
hammurabi
gave
pressing
orders
that
the
obstruction
was
to
be
removed
and
the
canal
made
navigable
within
three
days
damage
was
often
done
to
the
banks
of
canals
by
floods
which
followed
the
winter
rains
and
a
letter
of
gives
an
interesting
account
of
a
sudden
rise
of
the
water
in
the
irnina
canal
so
that
it
overflowed
its
banks
the
king
was
building
a
palace
at
the
city
of
which
was
supplied
by
the
irnina
canal
and
every
year
it
was
possible
to
put
so
much
work
into
the
building
but
one
year
when
little
more
than
a
third
of
the
work
was
done
the
building
operations
were
stopped
by
flood
the
canal
having
overflowed
its
banks
so
that
the
water
rose
right
up
to
the
wall
of
the
town
in
return
for
the
duty
of
keeping
the
canals
in
order
the
villagers
along
the
banks
had
the
privilege
of
fishing
in
its
waters
in
the
portion
which
was
in
their
charge
and
any
poaching
by
other
villagers
in
this
part
of
the
stream
was
strictly
forbidden
on
one
occasion
in
the
reign
of
son
and
successor
the
fishermen
of
the
district
of
rabim
went
down
in
their
boats
to
the
district
of
shakanim
and
caught
fish
there
contrary
to
the
law
so
the
inhabitants
of
shakanim
complained
of
this
poaching
to
the
king
who
sent
a
palace
official
to
the
authorities
of
sippar
near
which
city
the
districts
in
question
lay
with
orders
to
inquire
into
the
matter
and
take
steps
to
prevent
all
such
poaching
for
the
future
the
regulation
of
transportation
on
the
canals
was
also
under
the
royal
jurisdiction
the
method
of
reckoning
the
size
of
ships
has
already
been
described
and
there
is
evidence
that
the
king
possessed
numerous
vessels
of
all
sizes
for
the
carrying
of
grain
wool
and
dates
as
well
as
for
the
wood
and
stone
employed
in
his
building
operations
each
ship
seems
to
have
had
its
own
crew
under
the
command
of
a
captain
and
it
is
probable
that
officials
who
regulated
the
transportation
from
the
centres
where
they
were
stationed
were
placed
in
charge
of
separate
sections
of
the
rivers
and
of
the
canals
it
is
obvious
from
the
account
that
has
been
given
of
the
numerous
operations
directly
controlled
and
superintended
by
the
king
that
he
had
need
of
a
very
large
body
of
officials
by
whose
means
he
was
enabled
to
carry
out
successfully
the
administration
of
the
country
in
the
course
of
the
account
we
have
made
mention
of
the
judges
and
judicial
officers
the
assessors
and
collectors
of
revenue
and
the
officials
of
the
palace
who
were
under
the
direct
orders
it
is
also
obvious
that
different
classes
of
officers
were
in
charge
of
all
the
departments
of
the
administration
two
classes
of
officials
who
were
placed
in
charge
of
the
public
works
and
looked
after
and
controlled
the
public
slaves
and
probably
also
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
collection
of
the
revenue
had
special
privileges
assigned
to
them
and
special
legislation
was
drawn
up
to
protect
them
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
same
as
payment
for
their
duties
they
were
each
granted
land
with
a
house
and
garden
they
were
assigned
the
use
of
certain
sheep
and
cattle
with
which
to
stock
their
land
and
in
addition
they
received
a
regular
salary
they
were
in
a
sense
personal
retainers
of
the
king
and
were
liable
to
be
sent
at
any
moment
on
a
special
mission
to
carry
out
the
commands
disobedience
was
severely
punished
for
if
such
an
officer
when
detailed
for
a
special
mission
did
not
go
but
hired
a
substitute
he
was
liable
to
be
put
to
death
and
the
substitute
he
had
hired
could
take
his
office
sometimes
an
officer
was
sent
for
long
periods
some
distance
from
his
home
to
take
charge
of
a
garrison
and
when
this
was
done
his
home
duties
were
performed
by
another
man
who
temporarily
occupied
his
house
and
land
but
gave
it
back
to
the
officer
on
his
return
if
such
an
officer
had
a
son
old
enough
to
perform
his
duty
in
his
absence
he
was
allowed
to
do
so
and
to
till
his
lands
but
if
the
son
was
too
young
the
substitute
who
took
the
place
had
to
pay
of
the
produce
of
the
land
to
the
mother
for
his
education
before
departing
on
his
journey
to
the
garrison
it
was
the
duty
to
arrange
for
the
proper
cultivation
of
his
land
and
the
discharge
of
his
local
duties
during
his
absence
if
he
omitted
to
do
so
and
left
his
land
and
duties
neglected
for
more
than
a
year
and
another
had
meanwhile
taken
his
place
on
his
return
he
could
not
reclaim
his
land
and
office
it
will
be
obvious
therefore
that
his
position
was
a
specially
favoured
one
and
much
sought
after
and
these
regulations
ensured
that
the
duties
attaching
to
the
office
were
not
neglected
in
the
course
of
his
garrison
duty
or
when
on
special
service
these
officers
ran
some
risk
of
being
captured
by
the
enemy
and
in
that
event
regulations
were
drawn
up
for
their
ransom
if
the
captured
officer
was
wealthy
and
could
pay
for
his
own
ransom
he
was
bound
to
do
so
but
if
he
had
not
the
necessary
means
his
ransom
was
to
be
paid
out
of
the
local
temple
treasury
and
when
the
funds
in
the
temple
treasury
did
not
suffice
he
was
to
be
ransomed
by
the
state
it
was
specially
enacted
that
his
land
and
garden
and
house
were
in
no
case
to
be
sold
in
order
to
pay
for
his
ransom
these
were
inalienably
attached
to
the
office
which
he
held
and
he
was
not
allowed
to
sell
them
or
the
sheep
and
cattle
with
which
they
were
stocked
moreover
he
was
not
allowed
to
bequeath
any
of
this
property
to
his
wife
or
daughter
so
that
his
office
would
appear
to
have
been
hereditary
and
the
property
attached
to
it
to
have
been
entailed
on
his
son
if
he
succeeded
him
such
succession
would
not
of
course
have
taken
place
if
the
officer
by
his
own
neglect
or
disobedience
had
forfeited
his
office
and
its
privileges
during
his
lifetime
it
has
been
suggested
with
considerable
probability
that
these
officials
were
originally
personal
retainers
and
follows
of
the
founder
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
they
were
probably
assigned
lands
throughout
the
country
in
return
for
their
services
to
the
king
and
their
special
duties
were
to
preserve
order
and
uphold
the
authority
of
their
master
in
the
course
of
time
their
duties
were
no
doubt
modified
but
they
retained
their
privileges
and
they
must
have
continued
to
be
a
very
valuable
body
of
officers
on
whose
personal
loyalty
the
king
could
always
rely
in
the
preceding
chapter
we
have
already
seen
how
grants
of
considerable
estates
were
made
by
the
kassite
kings
of
the
third
dynasty
to
followers
who
had
rendered
conspicuous
services
and
at
the
same
time
they
received
the
privilege
of
holding
such
lands
free
of
all
liability
to
forced
labour
and
the
payment
of
tithes
and
taxes
we
may
conclude
that
the
class
of
royal
officers
under
the
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
had
a
similar
origin
in
the
present
chapter
from
information
recently
made
available
we
have
given
some
account
of
the
system
of
administration
adopted
by
the
early
kings
of
babylon
and
we
have
described
in
some
detail
the
various
classes
of
the
babylonian
population
their
occupations
and
the
conditions
under
which
they
lived
in
the
two
preceding
chapters
we
have
dealt
with
the
political
history
of
western
asia
from
the
very
earliest
period
of
the
sumerian
down
to
the
time
of
the
kassite
kings
in
the
course
of
this
account
we
have
seen
how
mesopotamia
in
the
dawn
of
history
was
in
the
sole
possession
of
the
sumerian
race
and
how
afterwards
it
fell
in
turn
under
the
dominion
of
the
semites
and
the
kings
of
elam
the
immigration
of
fresh
semitic
tribes
at
the
end
of
the
third
millennium
before
christ
resulted
in
the
establishment
in
babylon
of
the
semitic
kings
who
are
known
as
first
dynasty
kings
and
under
the
sway
of
hammurabi
the
greatest
of
this
group
of
kings
the
empire
thus
established
in
western
asia
had
every
appearance
of
permanence
although
elam
no
longer
troubled
babylon
a
great
danger
arose
from
a
new
and
unexpected
quarter
in
the
country
of
the
sea
which
comprised
the
districts
in
the
extreme
south
of
babylonia
on
the
shores
of
the
persian
gulf
the
sumerians
had
rallied
their
forces
and
they
now
declared
themselves
independent
of
babylonian
control
a
period
of
conflict
followed
between
the
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
and
the
kings
of
the
country
of
the
sea
in
which
the
latter
more
than
held
their
own
and
when
the
hittite
tribes
of
syria
invaded
northern
babylonia
in
the
reign
of
power
of
resistance
was
so
far
weakened
that
she
fell
an
easy
prey
to
the
rulers
of
the
country
of
the
sea
but
the
reappearance
of
the
sumerians
in
the
rôle
of
leading
race
in
western
asia
was
destined
not
to
last
long
and
was
little
more
than
the
last
flicker
of
vitality
exhibited
by
this
ancient
and
exhausted
race
thus
the
second
dynasty
fell
in
its
turn
before
the
onslaught
of
the
kassite
tribes
who
descended
from
the
mountainous
districts
in
the
west
of
elam
and
having
overrun
the
whole
of
mesopotamia
established
a
new
dynasty
at
babylon
and
adopted
babylonian
civilization
with
the
advent
of
the
kassite
kings
a
new
chapter
opens
in
the
history
of
western
asia
up
to
that
time
egypt
and
babylon
the
two
chief
centres
of
ancient
civilization
had
no
doubt
indirectly
influenced
one
another
but
they
had
not
come
into
actual
contact
during
the
period
of
the
kassite
kings
both
babylon
and
assyria
established
direct
relations
with
egypt
and
from
that
time
forward
the
influence
they
exerted
upon
one
another
was
continuous
and
unbroken
we
have
already
traced
the
history
of
babylon
up
to
this
point
in
the
light
of
recent
discoveries
and
a
similar
task
awaits
us
with
regard
to
assyria
before
we
enter
into
a
discussion
of
origin
and
early
history
in
the
light
of
recent
excavation
and
research
it
is
necessary
that
we
should
return
once
more
to
egypt
and
describe
the
course
of
her
history
from
the
period
when
thebes
succeeded
in
displacing
memphis
as
the
capital
city
chapter
vii
temples
and
tombs
of
thebes
we
have
seen
that
it
was
in
the
theban
period
that
egypt
emerged
from
her
isolation
and
for
the
first
time
came
into
contact
with
western
asia
this
grand
in
egyptian
history
seemed
to
be
the
appropriate
place
at
which
to
pause
in
the
description
of
our
latest
knowledge
of
egyptian
history
in
order
to
make
known
the
results
of
archaeological
discovery
in
mesopotamia
and
western
asia
generally
the
description
has
been
carried
down
past
the
point
of
convergence
of
the
two
originally
isolated
paths
of
egyptian
and
babylonian
civilization
and
what
new
information
the
latest
discoveries
have
communicated
to
us
on
this
subject
has
been
told
in
the
preceding
chapters
we
now
have
to
retrace
our
steps
to
the
point
where
we
left
egyptian
history
and
resume
the
thread
of
our
egyptian
narrative
the
hyksos
conquest
and
the
rise
of
thebes
are
practically
contemporaneous
the
conquest
took
place
perhaps
three
or
four
hundred
years
after
the
first
advancement
of
thebes
to
the
position
of
capital
of
egypt
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
position
was
not
retained
during
the
time
of
the
xiith
dynasty
the
kings
of
that
dynasty
though
they
were
thebans
did
not
reign
at
thebes
their
royal
city
was
in
the
north
in
the
neighbourhood
of
lisht
and
mêdûm
where
their
pyramids
were
erected
and
their
chief
care
was
for
the
lake
province
of
the
fayyûm
which
was
largely
the
creation
of
amenemhat
iii
the
moeris
of
the
greeks
it
was
not
till
thebes
became
the
focus
of
the
national
resistance
to
the
hyksos
that
its
period
of
greatness
began
henceforward
it
was
the
undisputed
capital
of
egypt
enlarged
and
embellished
by
the
care
and
munificence
of
a
hundred
kings
enriched
by
the
tribute
of
a
hundred
conquered
nations
but
were
we
to
confine
ourselves
to
the
consideration
only
of
the
latest
discoveries
of
theban
greatness
after
the
expulsion
of
the
hyksos
we
should
be
omitting
much
that
is
of
interest
and
importance
for
the
egyptians
the
first
grand
climacteric
in
their
history
after
the
foundation
of
the
monarchy
was
the
transference
of
the
royal
power
from
memphis
and
herakleopolis
to
a
theban
house
the
second
which
followed
soon
after
was
the
hyksos
invasion
the
two
are
closely
connected
in
theban
history
it
is
thebes
that
defeated
herakleopolis
and
conquered
memphis
it
is
theban
power
that
was
overthrown
by
the
hyksos
it
is
thebes
that
expelled
them
and
initiated
the
second
great
period
of
egyptian
history
we
therefore
resume
our
narrative
at
a
point
before
the
great
increase
of
theban
power
at
the
time
of
the
expulsion
of
the
hyksos
and
will
trace
this
power
from
its
rise
which
followed
the
defeat
of
herakleopolis
and
memphis
it
is
upon
this
epoch
the
beginning
of
theban
power
that
the
latest
discoveries
at
thebes
have
thrown
some
new
light
more
than
anywhere
else
in
egypt
excavations
have
been
carried
on
at
thebes
on
the
site
of
the
ancient
capital
of
the
country
and
here
if
anywhere
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
found
no
new
thing
to
be
exhumed
from
the
soil
no
new
fact
to
be
added
to
our
knowledge
of
egyptian
history
yet
here
no
less
than
at
abydos
has
the
archaeological
exploration
of
the
last
few
years
been
especially
successful
and
we
have
seen
that
the
ancient
city
of
thebes
has
a
great
deal
more
to
tell
us
than
we
had
expected
the
most
ancient
remains
at
thebes
were
discovered
by
newberry
in
the
shape
of
two
tombs
of
the
vith
dynasty
cut
upon
the
face
of
the
hill
of
shêkh
abd
on
the
west
bank
of
the
nile
opposite
luxor
every
winter
traveller
to
egypt
knows
well
the
ride
from
the
sandy
shore
opposite
the
luxor
temple
along
the
narrow
pathway
between
the
gardens
and
the
canal
across
the
bridges
and
over
the
cultivated
land
to
the
ramesseum
behind
which
rises
shêkh
abd
with
its
countless
tombs
ranged
in
serried
rows
along
the
scarred
and
scarped
face
of
the
hill
this
hill
which
is
geologically
a
fragment
of
the
plateau
behind
which
some
gigantic
landslip
was
sent
sliding
in
the
direction
of
the
river
leaving
the
picturesque
gorge
and
cliffs
of
dêr
to
mark
the
place
from
which
it
was
riven
was
evidently
the
seat
of
the
oldest
theban
necropolis
here
were
the
tombs
of
the
theban
chiefs
in
the
period
of
the
old
kingdom
two
of
which
have
been
found
by
newberry
in
later
times
it
would
seem
these
tombs
were
largely
occupied
and
remodelled
by
the
great
nobles
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
so
that
now
nearly
all
the
tombs
extant
on
shêkh
abd
belong
to
that
dynasty
of
the
thebes
of
the
ixth
and
xth
dynasties
when
the
herakleopolites
ruled
we
have
in
the
british
museum
two
very
remarkable
statues
one
of
which
is
here
illustrated
of
the
steward
of
the
palace
mera
the
tomb
from
which
they
came
is
not
known
both
are
very
beautiful
examples
of
the
egyptian
art
and
are
executed
in
a
style
eminently
characteristic
of
the

in
many
respects
perhaps
the
most
picturesque
place
in

the
greatest

built
for
the

this
temple
is
an
entirely
new
discovery
made
by
naville
and
hall
in
the
results
obtained
up
to
date
have
been
of
very
great
importance
especially
with
regard
to
the
history
of
egyptian
art
and
architecture
for
our
sources
of
information
were
few
and
we
were
previously
not
very
well
informed
as
to
the
condition
of
art
in
the
time
of
the
xith
dynasty
the
new
temple
lies
immediately
to
the
south
of
the
great
xviiith
dynasty
temple
at
dêr
which
has
always
been
known
and
which
was
excavated
first
by
mariette
and
later
by
naville

egypt

to
the
results
of
the
later
excavations
we
shall
return
when
they
were
finally
completed
in
the
year
the
great
xviiith
dynasty
temple
which
was
built
by
queen
hatshepsu
had
been
entirely
cleared
of
débris
and
the
colonnades
had
been
partially
restored
under
the
care
of
somers
clarke
in
order
to
make
a
roof
under
which
to
protect
the
sculptures
on
the
walls
the
whole
mass
of
débris
consisting
largely
of
fallen
from
the
cliffs
above
which
had
almost
hidden
the
temple
was
removed
but
a
large
tract
lying
to
the
south
of
the
temple
which
was
also
covered
with
similar
mounds
of
débris
was
not
touched
but
remained
to
await
further
investigation
it
was
here
beneath
these
heaps
of
débris
that
the
new
temple
was
found
when
work
was
resumed
by
the
egypt
exploration
fund
in
the
actual
tomb
of
the
king
has
not
yet
been
revealed
although
that
of
mentuhetep
who
may
have
been
his
immediate
predecessor
was
discovered
by
carter
in
it
was
known
however
and
still
uninjured
in
the
reign
of
ramses
ix
of
the
xxth
dynasty
then
as
we
learn
from
the
report
of
the
inspectors
sent
to
examine
the
royal
tombs
which
is
preserved
in
the
abbott
papyrus
they
found
the
of
king
which
is
in
tjesret

ancient

was
intact
we
know
therefore
that
it
was
intact

the
description
of
it
as
a
is
interesting
for
in
the
inscription
of
tetu
the
priest
of
who
was
buried
at
abydos
is
said
to
have
been
a
pyramid
that
the
newly
discovered
temple
was
called
we
know
from
several
inscriptions
found
in
it
and
the
most
remarkable
thing
about
this
temple
is
that
in
its
centre
there
was
a
pyramid
this
must
be
the
which
was
found
intact
by
the
inspectors
so
that
the
tomb
itself
must
be
close
by
but
it
does
not
seem
to
have
been
beneath
the
pyramid
below
which
is
only
solid
rock
it
is
perhaps
a
gallery
cut
in
the
cliffs
at
the
back
of
the
temple
the
pyramid
was
then
a
dummy
made
of
rubble
within
a
revetment

heavy
flint
nodules
which
was
faced
with
fine
limestone
it
was
erected
on
a
base
with
heavy
cornice
of
the
usual
egyptian
pattern
this
central
pyramid
was
surrounded
by
a
roofed
hall
or
ambulatory
of
small
octagonal
pillars
the
outside
wall
of
which
was
decorated
with
coloured
reliefs
depicting
various
scenes
connected
with
the
or
of
the
king
processions
of
the
warriors
and
magnates
of
the
realm
scenes
of
husbandry
and
so
forth
all
of
which
were
considered
appropriate
to
the
chapel
of
a
royal
tomb
at
that
period
outside
this
wall
was
an
open
colonnade
of
square
pillars
the
whole
of
this
was
built
upon
an
artificially
squared
rectangular
platform
of
natural
rock
about
fifteen
feet
high
to
north
and
south
of
this
were
open
courts
the
southern
is
bounded
by
the
hill
the
northern
is
now
bounded
by
the
great

before
this
was
built
there
was
evidently
a
very
large

measure
six
feet
by

feet
six
inches
they
are
beautifully
squared
and

alternate
sizes
and
the
walls
generally
may
be
said
to
be
among
the
finest
yet
found
in
egypt
we
have
already
remarked
that
the
architects
of
the
middle
kingdom
appear
to
have
been
specially
fond
of
fine
masonry

white
stone

contrast

these
splendid

with
their
great

the
bad
rough

xviiith

degenerated

the

that
the
peculiar

of
the
latter

its
tiers

not
an

perfections
of
the
work
of
his
hands
in
every
kind
of
rare
stone
in
gold
and

in
ivory
and
now
since
mertisen
and
his
son
were
the
chief
artists
of
their
day
it
is
more
than
probable
that
they
were
employed
to
decorate
their
funerary
chapel
so
that
in
all
probability
the
xith
dynasty
reliefs
from
dêr
are
the
work
of
mertisen
and
his
son
and
in
them
we
see
the
actual
of
going
forth
and
returning
the
poising
of
the
arm
to
bring
the
hippopotamus
low
the
going
of
the
runner
to
which
he
refers
on
his
tombstone
this
adds
a
note
of
personal
interest
to
the
reliefs
an
interest
which
is
often
sadly
wanting
in
egypt
where
we
rarely
know
the
names
of
the
great
artists
whose
works
we
admire
so
much
we
have
recovered
the
names
of
the
sculptor
and
painter
of
seti
temple
at
abydos
and
that
of
the
sculptor
of
some
of
the
tombs
at
tell
but
otherwise
very
few
names
of
the
artists
are
directly
associated
with
the
temples
and
tombs
which
they
decorated
and
of
the
architects
we
know
little
more
the
great
temple
of
dêr
was
however
we
know
designed
by
senmut
the
chief
architect
to
queen
hatshepsu
it
is
noticeable
that
art
if
it
is
is
of
a
peculiar
character
it
is
not
quite
so
fully
developed
as
that
of
the
succeeding
xiith
dynasty
the
drawing
of
the
figures
is
often
peculiar
strange
lanky
forms
taking
the
place
of
the
perfect
proportions
of
the
and
the
xiith

styles
great
elaboration
is
bestowed
upon
decoration
which
is
again
of
a
type
rather
archaic
in
character
when
compared
with
that
of
the
xiith
dynasty
we
are
often
reminded
of
the
rude
sculptures
which
used
to
be
regarded
as
typical
of
the
art
of
the
xith
dynasty
while
at
the
same
time
we
find
work
which
could
not
be
surpassed
by
the
best
xiith
dynasty
masters
in
fact
the
art
of
reign
was
the
art
of
a
transitional
period
under
the
decadent
memphites
of
the
viith
and
viiith
dynasties
egyptian
art
rapidly
fell
from
the
high
estate
which
it
had
attained
under
the
vth
dynasty
and
though
good
work
was
done
under
the
hierakonpolites
the
chief
characteristic
of
egyptian
art
at
the
time
of
the
xth
and
early
xith
dynasties
is
its
curious
roughness
and
almost
barbaric
appearance
when
however
the
kings
of
the
xith
dynasty
reunited
the
whole
land
under
one
sceptre
and
the
long
reign
of
mentuhetep
enabled
the
reconsolidation
of
the
realm
to
be
carried
out
by
one
hand
art
began
to
revive
and
just
as
to
must
be
attributed
the
renascence
of
the
egyptian
state
under
the
hegemony
of
thebes
so
must
the
revival
of
art
in
his
reign
be
attributed
to
his
great
artists
mertisen
and
his
son
they
carried
out
in
the
realm
of
art
what
their
king
had
carried
out
in
the
political
realm
and
to
them
must
be
attributed
the
origin
of
the
art
of
the
middle
kingdom
which
under
the
xiith
dynasty
attained
so
high
a
pitch
of
excellence
the
sculptures
of
the
temple
at
dêr
then
are
monuments
of
the
renascence
of
egyptian
art
after
the
state
of
decadence
into
which
it
had
fallen
during
the
long
civil
wars
between
south
and
north
it
is
a
reviving
art
struggling
out
of
barbarism
to
regain
perfection
and
therefore
has
much
about
it
that
seems
archaic
stiff
and
curious
when
compared
with
later
work
to
the
xviiith
dynasty
egyptian
it
would
no
doubt
have
seemed
hopelessly
and
even
and
he
had
no
qualms
about
sweeping
it
aside
whenever
it
appeared
in
the
way
of
the
work
of
his
own
time
but
to
us
this
very
strangeness
gives
additional
charm
and
interest
and
we
can
only
be
thankful
that
work
has
lasted
in
fragments
only
it
is
true
to
our
own
day
to
tell
us
the
story
of
a
little
known
chapter
in
the
history
of
ancient
egyptian
art
from
this
description
it
will
have
been
seen
that
the
temple
is
an
important
monument
of
the
egyptian
art
and
architecture
of
the
middle
kingdom
it
is
the
only
temple
of
that
period
of
which
considerable
traces
have
been
found
and
on
that
account
the
study
of
it
will
be
of
the
greatest
interest
it
is
the
best
preserved
of
the
older
temples
of
egypt
and
at
thebes
it
is
by
far
the
most
ancient
building
recovered
historically
it
has
given
us
a
new
king
of
the
xith
dynasty
mentuhetep
and
the
name
of
the
queen
of
mentuhetep
aasheit
who
seems
to
have
been
an
ethiopian
to
judge
from
her
portrait
which
has
been
discovered
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
one
of
the
priestesses
was
a
negress
the
name
may
be
unfamiliar
to
those
readers
who
are
acquainted
with
the
lists
of
the
egyptian
kings
it
is
a
correction
of
the
former
reading
which
is
now
known
from
these
excavations
to
be
erroneous
or
as
he
used
to
be
called
is
mentuhetep
iii
of
arrangement
before
him
there
seem
to
have
come
the
kings
mentuhetep
who
is
also
commemorated
in
this
temple
and
after
him
mentuhetep
iv
and
seânkhkarâ
mentuhetep
v
who
were
followed
by
an
antef
bearing
the
banner
or
this
king
was
followed
by
amenemhat
i
the
first
king
of
the
xiith
dynasty
antef
may
be
numbered
antef
i
as
the
prince
antefa
who
founded
the
xith
dynasty
did
not
assume
the
title
of
king
other
kings
of
the
name
of
antef
also
ruled
over
egypt
and
they
used
to
be
regarded
as
belonging
to
the
xith
dynasty
but
steindorff
has
now
proved
that
they
really
reigned
after
the
xiiith
dynasty
and
immediately
before
the
sekenenrâs
who
were
the
fighters
of
the
hyksos
and
predecessors
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
the
second
names
of
antef
iii
and
antef
iv
are
exactly
similar
to
those
of
the
xiiith
dynasty
kings
and
quite
unlike
those
of
the
mentuheteps
also
at
koptos
a
decree
of
antef
ii
has
been
found
inscribed
on
a
doorway
of
usertsen
senusret
i
so
that
he
can
not
have
preceded
him
petrie
does
not
yet
accept
these
conclusions
and
classes
all
the
antefs
together
with
the
mentuheteps
in
the
xith
dynasty
he
considers
that
he
has
evidence
from
herakleopolis
that
antef
whom
he
numbers
antef
v
preceded
the
xiith
dynasty
and
he
supposes
that
the
decree
of
at
koptos
is
a
later
copy
of
the
original
and
was
inscribed
during
the
xiith
dynasty
but
this
is
a
difficult
saying
the
probabilities
are
that
steindorff
is
right
antef
must
however
have
preceded
the
xiith
dynasty
since
an
official
of
that
period
refers
to
his
father
as
having
lived
in
time
the
necropolis
of
dêr
was
no
doubt
used
all
through
the
period
of
the
xith
and
xiith
dynasties
and
many
tombs
of
that
period
have
been
found
there
a
large
number
of
these
were
obliterated
by
the
building
of
the
great
temple
of
queen
hatshepsu
in
the
northern
part
of
the
we
know
of
one
tomb
of
that
period
which
runs
right
underneath
this
temple
from
the
north
and
there
is
another
that
is
entered
at
the
south
side
which
also
runs
down
underneath
it
several
tombs
were
likewise
found
in
the
court
between
it
and
the
xith
dynasty
temple
we
know
that
the
xviiith
dynasty
temple
was
largely
built
over
this
court
and
we
can
see
now
the
xith
dynasty
on
the
west
of
the
court
running
northwards
underneath
the
mass
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
temple
in
all
probability
then
when
the
temple
of
hatshepsu
was
built
the
larger
portion
of
the
middle
kingdom
necropolis
of
reached
by
pits
which
had
filled
up
the
bay
to
the
north
of
the
mentuhetep
temple
was
covered
up
and
obliterated
just
as
the
older
vith
dynasty
gallery
tombs
of
shêkh
abd
had
been
appropriated
and
altered
at
the
same
period
the
kings
of
the
xiith
and
xiiith
dynasties
were
not
buried
at
thebes
as
we
have
seen
but
in
the
north
at
dashûr
lisht
and
near
the
fayymn
with
which
their
royal
city
at
had
brought
them
into
contact
but
at
the
end
of
the
xiiith
dynasty
the
great
invasion
of
the
hyksos
probably
occurred
and
all
northern
egypt
fell
under
the
arab
sway
the
native
kings
were
driven
south
from
the
fayymn
to
abydos
koptos
and
thebes
and
at
thebes
they
were
buried
in
a
new
necropolis
to
the
north
of
dêr
probably
then
full
on
the
flank
of
a
long
spur
of
hill
which
is
now
called
here
the
theban
kings
of
the
period
between
the
xiiith
and
xviith
dynasties
upuantemsaf
antef
and
his
descendants
antefs
iii
and
iv
were
buried
in
their
time
the
pressure
of
foreign
invasion
seems
to
have
been
felt
for
to
judge
from
their
coffins
which
show
progressive
degeneration
of
style
and
workmanship
poverty
now
afflicted
upper
egypt
and
art
had
fallen
sadly
from
the
high
standard
which
it
had
reached
in
the
days
of
the
xith
and
xiith
dynasties
probably
the
later
antefs
and
sebekemsafs
were
vassals
of
the
hyksos
their
descendants
of
the
xviith
dynasty
were
buried
in
the
same
necropolis
of
and
so
were
the
first
two
kings
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
aahmes
and
amenhetep
i
the
tombs
of
the
last
two
have
not
yet
been
found
but
we
know
from
the
abbott
papyrus
that
was
here
for
like
that
of
menttihetep
iii
it
was
found
intact
by
the
inspectors
it
was
a
of
very
great
length
and
will
be
a
most
interesting
find
when
it
is
discovered
as
it
no
doubt
eventually
will
be
aahmes
had
a
tomb
at
abydos
which
was
discovered
by
currelly
working
for
the
egypt
exploration
fund
this
however
like
the
abydene
tomb
of
senusret
iii
was
in
all
likelihood
a
sham
or
secondary
tomb
the
king
having
most
probably
been
buried
at
thebes
in
the
the
abydos
tomb
is
of
interesting
construction
the
entrance
is
by
a
simple
pit
from
which
a
gallery
runs
round
in
a
curving
direction
to
a
great
hall
supported
by
eighteen
square
pillars
beyond
which
is
a
further
gallery
which
was
never
finished
nothing
was
found
in
the
tomb
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
due
west
of
and
in
a
line
with
the
tomb
currelly
found
a
analogous
to
those
of
dêr
approached
not
by
means
of
a
ramp
but
by
stairways
at
the
side
it
was
evidently
the
funerary
temple
of
the
tomb
illustration
statue
of
queen
grandmother
of
aahmes
the
conqueror
of
the
hyksos
and
founder
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
about
british
museum
from
the
photograph
by
mansell
co
the
secondary
tomb
of
usertsen
senusret
iii
at
abydos
which
has
already
been
mentioned
was
discovered
in
the
preceding
year
by
weigall
and
excavated
by
currelly
in
it
lies
north
of
the
aahmes
temple
between
it
and
the
main
cemetery
of
abydos
it
is
a
great
or
like
those
of
the
later
kings
at
thebes
with
the
usual
apparatus
of
granite
plugs
barriers
pits
to
defy
plunderers
the
tomb
had
been
plundered
nevertheless
though
it
is
probable
that
the
robbers
were
vastly
disappointed
with
what
they
found
in
it
currelly
ascribes
the
absence
of
all
remains
to
the
plunderers
but
the
fact
is
that
there
probably
never
was
anything
in
it
but
an
empty
sarcophagus
near
the
tomb
weigall
discovered
some
dummy
mastabas
a
find
of
great
interest
just
as
the
king
had
a
secondary
tomb
so
secondary
mastabas
mere
dummies
of
rubble
like
the
xith
dynasty
pyramid
at
dêr
were
erected
beside
it
to
look
like
the
tombs
of
his
courtiers
some
curious
sinuous
brick
walls
which
appear
to
act
as
dividing
lines
form
a
remarkable
feature
of
this
sham
cemetery
in
a
line
with
the
tomb
on
the
edge
of
the
cultivation
is
the
funerary
temple
belonging
to
it
which
was
found
by
in
nothing
remains
but
the
bases
of
the
fluted
limestone
columns
and
some
brick
walls
a
headless
statue
of
usertsen
was
found
we
have
an
interesting
example
of
the
custom
of
building
a
secondary
tomb
for
royalties
in
these
two
nécropoles
of
and
abydos
queen
the
grandmother
of
aahmes
a
beautiful
statuette
of
whom
may
be
seen
in
the
british
museum
had
a
small
pyramid
at
abydos
eastward
of
and
in
a
line
with
the
temple
and
secondary
tomb
of
aahmes
in
mace
attempted
to
find
the
chamber
but
could
not
in
the
next
year
currelly
found
between
it
and
the
aahmes
tomb
a
small
chapel
containing
a
splendid
stele
on
which
aahmes
commemorates
his
grandmother
who
he
says
was
buried
at
thebes
and
had
a
at
abydos
and
he
records
his
determination
to
build
her
also
a
pyramid
at
abydos
out
of
his
love
and
veneration
for
her
memory
it
thus
appeared
that
the
pyramid
to
the
east
was
simply
a
dummy
like
mastabas
or
the
mentuhetep
pyramid
at
dêr
was
actually
buried
at
her
secondary
pyramid
like
that
of
aahmes
himself
was
in
the
at
abydos
though
it
was
not
an
imitation
but
a
dummy
pyramid
of
rubble
this
well
illustrates
the
whole
custom
of
the
royal
primary
and
secondary
tombs
which
as
we
have
seen
had
obtained
in
the
case
of
royal
personages
from
the
time
of
the
dynasty
when
aha
had
two
tombs
one
at
nakâda
and
the
other
at
abydos
it
is
probable
that
all
the
dynasty
tombs
at
abydos
are
secondary
the
kings
being
really
buried
elsewhere
after
their
time
we
know
for
certain
that
tjeser
and
snefru
had
duplicate
tombs
possibly
also
unas
and
certainly
usertsen
senusret
iii
amenemhat
iii
and
aahmes
while
mentuhetep
iii
and
queen
had
dummy
pyramids
as
well
as
their
tombs
ramses
iii
also
had
two
tombs
both
at
thebes
the
reasons
for
this
custom
were
two
first
the
desire
to
elude
plunderers
and
second
the
wish
to
give
the
ghost
a
on
the
sacred
soil
of
abydos
or
sakkâra
as
the
inscription
of
aahmes
which
records
the
building
of
the
dummy
pyramid
of
is
of
considerable
interest
it
may
here
be
translated
the
text
reads
came
to
pass
that
when
his
majesty
the
king
even
the
king
of
south
and
north
son
of
the
sun
aahmes
giver
of
life
was
taking
his
pleasure
in
the
the
hereditary
princess
greatly
favoured
and
greatly
prized
the
daughter
the
sister
the
wife
and
great
wife
of
the
king
the
living
was
in
the
presence
of
his
majesty
and
the
one
spake
unto
the
other
seeking
to
do
honour
to
these
there
which
consisteth
in
the
pouring
of
water
the
offering
upon
the
altar
the
painting
of
the
stele
at
the
beginning
of
each
season
at
the
festival
of
the
new
moon
at

feast
of

of

sixth

of
thoth
the
beginning
of
every
season
of
heaven
and
earth
and
his
sister
spake
answering
him
hath
one
remembered
these
matters
and
wherefore
hath
this
word
been
said
prithee
what
hath
come
into
thy
heart
the
king
spake
saying
for
me
i
have
remembered
the
mother
of
my
mother
the
mother
of
my
father
the
great
wife
and
mother
deceased
whose
and
are
at
this
moment
upon
the
soil
of
thebes
and
abydos
i
have
spoken
thus
unto
thee
because
my
majesty
desireth
to
cause
a
pyramid
and
chapel
to
be
made
for
her
in
the
sacred
land
as
a
gift
of
a
monument
from
my
majesty
and
that
its
lake
should
be
dug
its
trees
planted
and
its
offerings
prescribed
that
it
should
be
provided
with
slaves
furnished
with
lands
and
endowed
with
cattle
with
priests
and
priests
performing
their
duties
each
man
knowing
what
he
hath
to
behold
when
his
majesty
had
thus
spoken
these
things
were
immediately
carried
out
his
majesty
did
these
things
on
account
of
the
greatness
of
the
love
which
he
bore
her
which
was
greater
than
anything
never
had
ancestral
kings
done
the
like
for
their
mothers
behold
his
majesty
extended
his
arm
and
bent
his
hand
and
made
for
her
the
offering
to
geb
to
the
ennead
of
gods
to
the
lesser
ennead
of
gods
to
anubis
in
the
shrine
thousands
of
offerings
of
bread
beer
oxen
geese
cattle
to
the
queen
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
inscriptions
discovered
in
egypt
in
recent
years
for
the
picturesqueness
of
its
diction
is
unusual
a
polite
periphrasis
for
the
dead
as
has
already
been
said
the
king
amenhetep
i
was
also
buried
in
the
but
the
tomb
has
not
yet
been
found
amenhetep
i
and
his
mother
queen
who
is
mentioned
in
the
inscription
translated
above
were
both
venerated
as
tutelary
demons
of
the
western
necropolis
of
thebes
after
their
deaths
as
also
was
mentuhetep
iii
at
dêr
both
kings
seem
to
have
been
worshipped
with
hathor
the
mistress
of
the
waste
the
worship
of
in
the
xviiith
dynasty
temple
of
dêr
was
a
novelty
introduced
by
the
priests
of
amen
at
that
time
but
the
worship
of
hathor
went
on
side
by
side
with
that
of
amen
in
a
chapel
with
a
shrine
at
the
side
of
the
great
temple
very
possibly
this
was
the
original
of
hathor
long
before
time
and
was
incorporated
with
the
great
temple
and
beautified
with
the
addition
of
a
pillared
hall
before
it
built
over
part
of
the
xith
dynasty
north
court
and
wall
by
architects
the
great
temple
the
excavation
of
which
for
the
egypt
exploration
fund
was
successfully
brought
to
an
end
by
naville
in
was
erected
by
queen
hatshepsu
in
honour
of
her
father
thothmes
i
and
her
thothmes
ii
and
received
a
few
additions
from
thothmes
iii
her
successor
he
however
did
not
complete
it
and
it
fell
into
disrepair
besides
suffering
from
the
iconoclastic
zeal
of
the
heretic
akhunaten
who
hammered
out
some
of
the
beautifully
painted
scenes
upon
its
walls
these
were
badly
restored
by
ramses
ii
whose
painting
is
easily
distinguished
from
the
original
work
by
the
dulness
and
badness
of
its
colour
the
peculiar
plan
and
other
remarkable
characteristics
of
this
temple
are
well
known
its
great
terraces
with
the
ramps
leading
up
to
them
flanked
by
colonnades
which
as
we
have
seen
were
imitated
from
the
design
of
the
old
xith
dynasty
temple
at
its
side
are
familiar
from
a
hundred
illustrations
and
the
marvellously
preserved
colouring
of
its
delicate
reliefs
is
known
to
every
winter
visitor
to
egypt
and
can
be
realized
by
those
who
have
never
been
there
through
the
medium
of
howard
wonderful
coloured
reproductions
published
in
edition
of
the
temple
by
the
egypt
exploration

the
great
temple

clear
of
all
the
débris
which
used
to
cover
it

lasting
monument
to
the

the
extraordinary
beauty
of

may
be
appreciated
from
the

in

will
serve
to
give
some
idea
of
the
beauty
of
the
surroundings
an
arid
beauty
it

true

all

desert
there
is
not

about

the
famous

which
the
jealous
thothmes
iii
chiselled
out
name
in
the
royal
cartouches
and
inserted
his
own
in
its
place

he
forgot
to
alter
the
gender
of

in

which
therefore
reads
thothmes
iii
she
made
this
monument
to
her
father
among
discoveries
here
one
of
the
most
important
is
that
of
the
altar
in
a
small
court
to
the
north
which
as
the
inscription
says
was
made
in
honour
of
the
god
beautiful
white
stone
of
it
is
of
the
finest
white
limestone
known
here
also
were
found
the
carved
ebony
doors
of
a
shrine
now
in
the
cairo
museum
one
of
the
most
beautiful
parts
of
the
temple
is
the
shrine
of
anubis
with
its
splendidly
preserved
paintings
and
perfect
columns
and
roof
of
white
limestone
the
effect
of
the
pure
white
stone
and
simplicity
of
architecture
is
almost
hellenic
the
shrine
of
hathor
has
been
known
since
the
time
of
mariette
but
in
connection
with
it
some
interesting
discoveries
have
been
made
during
the
excavation
of
the
xith
dynasty
temple
in
the
court
between
the
two
temples
were
found
a
large
number
of
small
votive
offerings
consisting
of
scarabs
beads
little
figures
of
cows
and
women
of
blue
glazed
and
rough
pottery
bronze
and
wood
and
blue
glazed
ware
ears
eyes
and
plaques
with
figures
of
the
sacred
cow
and
other
small
objects
of
the
same
nature
these
are
evidently
the
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
fellahîn
to
the
goddess
hathor
in
the
above
the
court
when
the
shrine
was
full
or
the
little
broken
the
sacristans
threw
them
over
the
wall
into
the
court
below
which
thus
became
a
kind
of
over
this
heap
the
sand
and
débris
gradually
collected
and
thus
they
were
preserved
the
objects
found
are
of
considerable
interest
to
anthropological
science
the
great
temple
was
built
as
we
have
said
in
honour
of
thothmes
i
and
ii
and
the
deities
and
hathor
more
especially
it
was
the
funerary
chapel
of
thothmes
i
his
tomb
was
excavated
not
in
the
which
was
doubtless
now
too
near
the
capital
city
and
not
in
a
sufficiently
dignified
position
of
aloofness
from
the
common
herd
but
at
the
end
of
the
long
valley
of
the
wadiyên
behind
the
above
dêr
hence
the
new
temple
was
oriented
in
the
direction
of
his
tomb
immediately
behind
the
temple
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
is
the
tomb
which
was
discovered
by
lepsius
and
cleared
in
for
theodore
davis
by
howard
carter
then
chief
inspector
of
antiquities
at
thebes
its
gallery
is
of
very
small
dimensions
and
it
winds
about
in
the
hill
in
corkscrew
fashion
like
the
tomb
of
aahmes
at
owing
to
its
extraordinary
length
the
heat
and
foul
air
in
the
depths
of
the
tomb
were
almost
insupportable
and
caused
great
difficulty
to
the
excavators
when
the
was
at
length
reached
it
was
found
to
contain
the
empty
sarcophagi
of
thothmes
i
and
of
hatshepsu
the
bodies
had
been
removed
for
in
the
time
of
the
xxist
dynasty

i
having
been
found
with
those
of
set
i
and
ramses
ii
in
the
famous
pit
at
dêr
which
was
discovered
by
maspero
in
thothmes
i
seems
to
have
had
another
and
more
elaborate
tomb
no

the
valley
of
the
tombs
of
the
kings
which
was
discovered
by

two
of

who
desired
even
more
remote
amenhetep

ai
the
former
chose
for
his
last
home
a
most
kingly
site
ancient
kings
had
raised
great
pyramids
of
artificial
stone
over
their
graves
amenhetep
perhaps
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
pharaoh
of
them
all
chose
to
have
a
natural
pyramid
for
his
grave
a
mountain
for
his
tumulus
the

us
the
tomb
of
this
monarch
opening
out
of
the
side
of
one
of
the
most
imposing
hills
in
the
western
valley
no
other
king
but
amenhetep
rested
beneath
this
hill
which
thus
marks
his
grave
and
his

it
is
in

the
valley
of
the
tombs

properly
speaking
that
the
tombs
of
thothmes
i
and
hatshepsu
lie
and
here
the
most
recent
discoveries
have
been
made
it
is
a
desolate
spot
as
we
come
over
the
hill
from
dêr
we
see
below
us
in
the
glaring
sunshine
a
rocky
canon
with
sides
sometimes
sheer
cliff
sometimes
sloped
by
great
falls
of
rock
in
past
ages
at
the
bottom
of
these
slopes
the
square
openings
of
the
many
royal
tombs
can
be
descried
see
illustration
far
below
we
see
the
forms
of
tourists
and
the
accompanying
them
moving
in
and
out
of
the
openings
like
ants
going
in
and
out
of
an
nest
nothing
is
heard
but
the
occasional
cry
of
a
kite
and
the
ceaseless
rhythmical
throbbing
of
the
of
the
electric

in
this
valley
some
remarkable
discoveries
have
been
made
during
the
last
few
years
in
grébaut
discovered
the
tomb
of
amenhetep
ii
in
which
was
found
the
mummy
of
the
king
intact
lying
in
its
sarcophagus
in
the
depths
of
the
tomb
the
royal
body
now
lies
there
for
all
to
see
the
tomb
is
lighted
with
electricity
as
are
all
the
principal
tombs
of
the
kings
at
the
head
of
the
sarcophagus
is
a
single
lamp
and
when
the
party
of
visitors
is
collected
in
silence
around
the
place
of
death
all
the
lights
are
turned
out
and
then
the
single
light
is
switched
on
showing
the
royal
head
illuminated
against
the
surrounding
blackness
the
effect
is
indescribably
weird
and
impressive
the
body
has
only
twice
been
removed
from
the
tomb
since
its
burial
the
second
time
when
it
was
for
a
brief
space
taken
up
into
the
sunlight
to
be
photographed
by
carter
in
january
the
temporary
removal
was
carefully
carried
out
the
body
of
his
majesty
being
borne
up
through
the
passages
of
the
tomb
on
the
shoulders
of
the
italian
electric
light
workmen
preceded
and
followed
by
impassive
arab
the
workmen
were
most
reverent
in
their
handling
of
the
body
of
il
gran
as
they
called
him
in
the
tomb
were
found
some
very
interesting
objects
including
a
model
boat
afterwards
stolen
across
which
lay
the
body
of
a
woman
this
body
now
lies
with
others
found
close

a
side
chamber
of
the
tomb
one
may
be
that
of

of
antiquities

decorated
with
representations
of

warlike

and
much
fine

all
of

the
returns
upon
itself
describing
a
curve
an
interesting
point
with
regard
to
it
is
that
it
had
evidently
been
violated
even
in
the
short
time
between
the
reigns
of
its
owner
and
probably
in
the
period
of
anarchy
which
prevailed
at
thebes
during
the
reign
of
the
heretic
akhunaten
for
in
one
of

and

the
heretic
readers
of

will
remember
that
iuaa
and
tuaa
are
mentioned
on
one
of
the
large
memorial
scarabs
of
amenhetep
iii
which
commemorates
his
marriage
the
tomb
has
yielded
an
almost
incredible
treasure
of
funerary
furniture
besides
the
actual
mummies
of
parents
including
a
chariot
overlaid
with
gold
gold
overlay
of
great
thickness
is
found
on
everything
boxes
chairs
etc
it
was
no
wonder
that
egypt
seemed
the
land
of
gold
to
the
asiatics
and
that
even
the
king
of
babylon
begs
this
very
pharaoh
amenhetep
to
send
him
gold
in
one
of
the
letters
found
at
tell
gold
is
as
water
in
thy
it
is
probable
that
egypt
really
attained
the
height
of
her
material
wealth
and
prosperity
in
the
reign
of
amenhetep
iii
certainly
her
dominion
reached
its
farthest
limits
in
his
time
and
his
influence
was
felt
from
the
tigris
to
the
sudan
he
hunted
lions
for
his
pleasure
in
northern
mesopotamia
and
he
built
temples
at
jebel
barkal
beyond
dongola
we
see
the
evidence
of
lavish
wealth
in
the
furniture
of
the
tomb
of
iuaa
and
tuaa
yet
fine
as
are
many
of
these
and
overladen
objects
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
they
have
neither
the
good
taste
nor
the
charm
of
the
beautiful
jewels
from
the
xiith
dynasty
tombs
at
dashûr
it
is
mere
vulgar
wealth
there
is
too
much
gold
thrown
about
gold
is
as
water
in
thy
in
three
hundred
time
egypt
was
to
know
what
poverty
meant
when
the
poor
of
the
xxist
dynasty
could
hardly
keep
body
and
soul
together
and
make
a
comparatively
decent
show
as
pharaohs
of
egypt
then
no
doubt
the
thebans
sighed
for
the
good
old
times
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
when
their
city
ruled
a
considerable
part
of
africa
and
western
asia
and
garnered
their
riches
into
her
coffers
but
the
days
of
the
xiith
dynasty
had
really
been
better
still
then
there
was
not
so
much
wealth
but
what
there
was
and
there
was
as
much
gold
then
too
was
used
sparingly
tastefully
and
simply
the
xiith
dynasty
not
the
xviiith
was
the
real
golden
age
of
egypt
from
the
funeral
panoply
of
a
tomb
like
that
of
iuaa
and
tuaa
we
can
obtain
some
idea
of
the
pomp
and
state
of
amenhetep
iii
but
the
remains
of
his
theban
palace
which
have
been
discovered
and
excavated
by
tytus
and
newberry
do
not
bear
out
this
idea
of
magnificence
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
palace
was
merely
a
pleasure
house
erected
very
hastily
and
destined
to
fall
to
pieces
when
its
owner
tired
of
it
or
died
like
the
many
palaces
of
the
late
khedive
ismail
it
stood
on
the
border
of
an
artificial
lake
whereon
the
pharaoh
and
his
consort
tii
sailed
to
take
their
pleasure
in
golden
barks
this
is
now
the
cultivated
rectangular
space
of
land
known
as
the
birket
habû
which
is
still
surrounded
by
the
remains
of
the
embankment
built
to
retain
its
waters
and
becomes
a
lake
during
the
inundation
on
the
western
shore
of
this
lake
amenhetep
erected
the
pleasure
dome
the
remains
of
which
still
cover
the
sandy
tract
known
as
south
of
the
great
temple
of
medînet
habû
these
remains
consist
merely
of
the
foundations
and
lowest
of
a
complicated
and
rambling
building
of
many
chambers
constructed
of
common
unburnt
brick
and
plastered
with
white
stucco
on
walls
and
floors
on
which
were
painted
beautiful
frescoes
of
fighting
bulls
birds
of
the
air
in
much
the
same
style
as
the
frescoes
of
tell
executed
in
the
next
reign
there
were
small
pillared
halls
the
columns
of
which
were
of
wood
mounted
on
bases
of
white
limestone
the
majority
still
remain
in
position
in
several
chambers
there
are
small
daïses
and
in
one
the
remains
of
a
throne
built
of
brick
and
mud
covered
with
plaster
and
stucco
upon
which
the
pharaoh
amenhetep
sat
this
is
the
palace
of
him
whom
the
greeks
called
memnon
who
ruled
egypt
when
israel
was
in
bondage
and
when
the
dynasty
of
minos
reigned
in
crete
here
by
the
side
of
his
the
most
powerful
of
egyptian
pharaohs
whiled
away
his
time
during
the
summer
heats
evidently
the
building
was
intended
to
be
of
the
lightest
construction
and
never
meant
to
last
but
to
our
ideas
it
seems
odd
that
an
egyptian
pharaoh
should
live
in
a
mud
palace
such
a
building
is
however
quite
suited
to
the
climate
of
egypt
as
are
the
modern
crude
brick
dwellings
of
the
fellahîn
in
the
ruins
of
the
palace
were
found
several
small
objects
of
interest
and
close
by
was
an
ancient
glass
manufactory
of
amenhetep
time
where
much
of
the
characteristic
beautifully
coloured
and
variegated
opaque
glass
of
the
period
was
made
illustration
the
of
shekh
thebes
the
tombs
of
the
magnates
of
amenhetep
reign
and
of
the
reigns
of
his
immediate
predecessors
were
excavated
as
has
been
said
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
hill
of
shêkh
where
was
the
earliest
theban
necropolis
no
doubt
many
of
the
early
tombs
of
the
time
of
the
vith
dynasty
were
appropriated
and
remodelled
by
the
xviiith
dynasty
magnates
we
have
an
instance
of
revenge
in
this
matter
in
the
case
of
the
tomb
of
imadua
a
great
priestly
official
of
the
time
of
the
xxth
dynasty
this
tomb
previously
belonged
to
an
xviiith
dynasty
worthy
but
imadua
appropriated
it
three
hundred
years
later
and
covered
up
all
its
frescoes
with
the
much
begilt
decoration
fashionable
in
his
period
perhaps
the
xviiith
dynasty
owner
had
stolen
it
from
an
original
owner
of
the
time
of
the
vith
dynasty
the
tomb
has
lately
been
cleared
out
by
newberry
much
work
of
the
same
kind
has
been
done
here
of
late
years
by
newberry
and
mond
in
succession
to
both
we
are
indebted
for
the
excavation
of
many
known
tombs
as
well
as
for
the
discovery
of
many
others
previously
unknown
among
the
former
was
that
of
sebekhetep
cleared
by
newberry
was
an
official
of
the
time
of
thothmes
iii
from
his
tomb
and
from
others
in
the
same
hill
came
many
years
ago
the
fine
frescoes
shown
in
the
illustration
which
are
among
the
most
valued
treasures
of
the
egyptian
department
of
the
british
museum
they
are
typical
specimens
of
the
of
an
xviiith
dynasty
tomb
on
one
may
be
seen
a
peasant
with
staff
in
hand
pulling
an
ear
of
corn
from
the
standing
crop
in
order
to
see
if
it
is
ripe
he
is
the
reaper
and
above
him
is
a
prayer
that
the
god
in
may
increase
the
crop
to
the
right
of
him
is
a
charioteer
standing
beside
a
car
and
reining
back
a
pair
of
horses
one
black
the
other
bay
below
is
another
charioteer
with
two
white
horses
he
sits
on
the
floor
of
the
car
with
his
back
to
them
eating
or
resting
while
they
nibble
the
branches
of
a
tree
close
by
another
scene
is
that
of
a
scribe
keeping
tally
of
offerings
brought
to
the
tomb
while
fellahm
are
bringing
flocks
of
geese
and
other
fowl
some
in
crates
the
inscription
above
is
apparently
addressed
by
the
to
the
man
with
the
crates
it
reads
thy
feet
because
of
the
geese
hearken
thou
knowest
not
the
next
minute
what
has
been
said
to
thee
above
a
reïs
with
a
stick
bids
other
peasants
squat
on
the
ground
before
addressing
the
scribe
and
he
is
saying
to
them
ye
down
to
the
third
scene
is
in
another
style
on
it
may
be
seen
semites
bringing
offerings
of
vases
of
gold
silver
and
copper
to
the
royal
presence
bowing
themselves
to
the
ground
and
kissing
the
dust
before
the
throne
the
fidelity
and
accuracy
with
which
the
racial
type
of
the
is
given
is
most
extraordinary
every
face
seems
a
portrait
and
each
one
might
be
seen
any
day
now
in
the
jewish
quarters
of
whitechapel
illustration
from
a
tomb
the
first
two
paintings
are
representative
of
a
very
common
style
of
in
these
tombs
the
care
with
which
the
animals
are
depicted
is
remarkable
possibly
one
of
the
finest
egyptian
representations
of
an
animal
is
the
fresco
of
a
goat
in
the
tomb
of
discovered
by
mond
there
is
even
an
attempt
here
at
chiaroscuro
which
is
unknown
to
egyptian
art
generally
except
at
tell
evidently
the
egyptian
painters
reached
the
apogee
of
their
art
towards
the
end
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
the
third
the
representation
of
is
of
a
type
also
well
known
at
this
period
in
all
the
chief
tombs
we
have
processions
of
egyptians
westerners
northerners
easterners
and
southerners
bringing
tribute
to
the
pharaoh
the
north
is
represented
by
the
semites
the
east
by
the
punites
when
they
occur
the
south
by
negroes
the
west
by
the
keftiu
or
people
of
crete
and
cyprus
the
representations
of
the
people
have
become
of
the
very
highest
interest
during
the
last
few
years
on
account
of
the
discoveries
in
crete
which
have
revealed
to
us
the
state
and
civilization
of
these
very
keftiu
evans
and
halbherr
have
discovered
at
knossos
and
phaistos
the
cities
and
of
the
king
who
sent
forth
their
ambassadors
to
egypt
with
gifts
for
the
mighty
pharaoh
these
ambassadors
were
painted
in
the
tombs
of
their
hosts
as
representative
of
the
quarter
of
the
world
from
which
they
came
the
two
chief
egyptian
representations
of
these
people
who
since
they
lived
in
greece
may
be
called
greeks
though
their
more
proper
title
would
be
are
to
be
found
in
the
tombs
of
rekhmarâ
and
senmut
the
former
a
vizier
under
thothmes
iii
the
latter
the
architect
of
temple
at
dêr
tomb
is
a
new
rediscovery
it
was
known
as
was
in
the
early
days
of
egyptological
science
and
prisse
copied
its
paintings
it
was
afterwards
lost
sight
of
until
rediscovered
by
newberry
and
steindorff
illustration
fresco
in
the
tomb
of
senmut
at
thebes
about
the
tomb
of
rekhmarâ
no
is
well
known
to
every
visitor
to
thebes
but
it
is
difficult
to
get
at
that
of
senmut
no
it
lies
at
the
top
of
the
hill
round
to
the
left
and
overlooking
dêr
an
appropriate
place
for
it
by
the
way
in
some
ways
representations
are
more
interesting
than
they
are
more
easily
seen
since
they
are
now
in
the
open
air
the
fore
hall
of
the
tomb
having
been
ruined
and
they
are
better
preserved
since
they
have
not
been
subjected
to
a
century
of
inspection
with
naked
candles
and
pawing
with
greasy
hands
as
have
frescoes
further
there
is
no
possibility
of
mistaking
what
they
represent
from
right
to
left
walking
in
procession
we
see
the
minoan
from
crete
carrying
in
their
hands
and
on
their
shoulders
great
cups
of
gold
and
silver
in
shape
like
the
famous
gold
cups
found
at
vaphio
in
lakonia
but
much
larger
also
a
ewer
of
gold
and
silver
exactly
like
one
of
bronze
discovered
by
evans
two
years
ago
at
knossos
and
a
huge
copper
jug
with
four
round
the
sides
all
these
vases
are
specifically
and
definitely
mycenaean
or
rather
following
the
new
terminology
minoan
they
are
of
greek
manufacture
and
are
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
pelasgian
greeks
the
bearers
wear
the
usual
mycenaean
costume
high
boots
and
a
gaily
ornamented
kilt
and
little
else
just
as
we
see
it
depicted
in
the
fresco
of
the
cupbearer
at
knossos
and
in
other
greek
representations
the
coiffure
possibly
the
most
characteristic
thing
about
the
mycenaean
greeks
is
faithfully
represented
by
the
egyptians
both
here
and
in
tomb
the
mycenaean
men
allowed
their
hair
to
grow
to
its
full
natural
length
like
women
and
wore
it
partly
hanging
down
the
back
partly
tied
up
in
a
knot
or
plait
the
of
the
dandy
paris
in
the
iliad
on
the
crown
of
the
head
this
was
the
universal
fashion
and
the
keftiu
are
consistently
depicted
by
the
xviiith
dynasty
egyptians
as
following
it
the
faces
in
the
senmut
fresco
are
not
so
well
portrayed
as
those
in
the
rekhmarâ
fresco
there
it
is
evident
that
the
first
three
ambassadors
are
faithfully
depicted
as
the
portraits
are
marked
the
procession
advances
from
left
to
right
the
first
man
great
chief
of
the
kefti
and
the
isles
of
the
green
sea
is
young
and
has
a
remarkably
small
mouth
with
an
amiable
expression
his
complexion
is
fair
rather
than
dark
but
his
hair
is
dark
brown
his
lieutenant
the
next
in
order
is
of
a
different
type
elderly
with
a
most
forbidding
visage
roman
nose
and
nutcracker
jaws
most
of
the
others
are
very
much
alike
young
dark
in
complexion
and
with
long
black
hair
hanging
below
their
waists
and
twisted
up
into
fantastic
knots
and
curls
on
the
tops
of
their
heads
one
carrying
on
his
shoulder
a
great
silver
vase
with
curving
handles
and
in
one
hand
a
dagger
of
early
european
bronze
age
type
is
looking
back
to
hear
some
remark
of
his
next
companion
any
one
of
these
might
have
sat
for
the
portrait
of
the
knossian
cupbearer
the
fresco
discovered
by
evans
in
the
of
minos
he
has
the
same
ruddy
brown
complexion
the
same
long
black
hair
dressed
in
the
same
fashion
the
same
kilt
and
he
bears
his
vase
in
much
the
same
way
we
have
only
to
allow
for
the
difference
of
egyptian
and
mycenaean
ways
of
drawing
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
these
keftiu
of
the
egyptians
were
cretans
of
the
minoan
age
they
used
to
be
considered
phoenicians
but
this
view
was
long
ago
exploded
they
are
not
semites
and
that
is
quite
enough
neither
are
they
asiatics
of
any
kind
they
are
purely
and
simply
mycenaean
or
rather
minoan
greeks
of
the
period
pelasgi
that
is
to
say
probably
no
discovery
of
more
importance
to
our
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
world
generally
and
of
our
own
culture
especially
has
ever
been
made
than
the
finding
of
mycenæ
by
schliemann
and
the
further
finds
that
have
resulted
therefrom
culminating
in
the
discoveries
of
arthur
evans
at
knossos
naturally
these
discoveries
are
of
extraordinary
interest
to
us
for
they
have
revealed
the
beginnings
and
first
bloom
of
the
european
civilization
of
for
our
are
neither
the
egyptians
nor
the
assyrians
nor
the
hebrews
but
the
hellenes
and
they
the
derived
most
of
their
civilization
from
the
people
whom
they
found
in
the
land
before
them
the
pelasgi
or
greeks
as
we
now
call
them
the
keftiu
of
the
egyptians
these
are
the
ancient
greeks
of
the
heroic
age
to
which
the
legends
of
the
hellenes
refer
in
their
day
were
fought
the
wars
of
troy
and
of
the
seven
against
thebes
in
their
day
the
tragedy
of
the
atridse
was
played
out
to
its
end
in
their
day
the
wise
minos
ruled
knossos
and
the
and
of
all
the
events
which
are
at
the
back
of
these
legends
we
know
nothing
the
hiéroglyphed
tablets
of
the
greeks
lie
before
us
but
we
can
not
read
them
we
can
only
see
that
the
minoan
writing
in
many
ways
resembled
the
egyptian
thus
again
confirming
our
impression
of
the
original
early
connection
of
the
two
cultures
in
view
of
this
connection
and
the
known
close
relations
between
crete
and
egypt
from
the
end
of
the
xiith
dynasty
to
the
end
of
the
xviiith
we
might
have
hoped
to
recover
at
knossos
a
bilingual
inscription
in
cretan
and
egyptian
hieroglyphs
which
would
give
us
the
key
to
the
minoan
script
and
tell
us
what
we
so
dearly
wish
to
know
but
this
hope
has
not
yet
been
realized
two
egyptian
inscriptions
have
been
found
at
knossos
but
no
bilingual
one
a
list
of
keftian
names
is
preserved
in
the
british
museum
upon
an
egyptian
from
thebes
with
what
is
perhaps
a
copy
of
a
single
cretan
hieroglyph
a
vase
but
again
nothing
bilingual
a
list
of
occurs
at
the
head
of
a
papyrus
also
in
the
british
museum
but
they
appear
to
be
nonsense
a
mere
imitation
of
the
sounds
of
a
strange
tongue
still
we
need
not
despair
of
finding
the
much
desired
bilingual
inscription
yet
perhaps
the
double
text
of
a
treaty
between
crete
and
egypt
like
that
of
ramses
ii
with
the
hittites
may
come
to
light
meanwhile
we
can
only
do
our
best
with
the
means
at
our
hand
to
trace
out
the
history
of
the
relations
of
the
oldest
european
culture
with
the
ancient
civilization
of
egypt
the
at
thebes
are
very
important
material
eor
it
is
due
to
them
that
the
voice
of
the
doubter
has
finally
ceased
to
be
heard
and
that
now
no
archaeologist
questions
that
the
egyptians
were
in
direct
communication
with
the
cretan
mycenæans
in
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
some
fifteen
hundred
years
before
christ
for
no
one
doubts
that
the
pictures
of
the
keftiu
are
pictures
of
mycenaeans
as
we
have
seen
we
know
that
this
connection
was
far
older
than
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
but
it
is
during
that
time
and
the
hyksos
period
that
we
have
the
clearest
documentary
proof
of
its
existence
from
the
statuette
of
abnub
and
the
alabastron
lid
of
king
khian
found
at
knossos
down
to
the
mycenaean
pottery
fragments
found
at
tell
a
site
which
has
been
utterly
abandoned
since
the
time
of
the
heretic
akhunaten
so
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
anything
found
there
being
later
than
his
time
that
the
connection
existed
as
late
as
the
time
of
the
xxth
dynasty
we
know
from
the
representations
of
golden
or
vases
of
mycenaean
form
in
the
tomb
of
ramses
iii
in
the
bibân
and
of
golden
cups
of
vaphio
type
in
the
tomb
of
imadua
already
mentioned
this
brings
the
connection
down
to
about
after
that
date
we
can
not
hope
to
find
any
certain
evidence
of
connection
for
by
that
time
the
mycenaean
civilization
had
probably
come
to
an
end
in
the
days
of
the
xiith
and
xviiith
dynasties
a
great
and
splendid
power
evidently
existed
in
crete
and
sent
its
peaceful
ambassadors
the
keftiu
who
are
represented
in
the
theban
tombs
to
egypt
but
with
the
xixth
dynasty
the
name
of
the
keftiu
disappears
from
egyptian
records
and
their
place
is
taken
by
a
congeries
of
warring
seafaring
tribes
whose
names
as
given
by
the
egyptians
seem
to
be
forms
of
tribal
and
place
names
well
known
to
us
in
the
greece
of
later
days
we
find
the
akaivasha
achaians
shakalsha
sagalassians
of
pisidia
tursha
tylissians
of
crete
and
shardana
sardians
allied
with
the
libyans
and
mashauash
maxyes
in
a
land
attack
upon
egypt
in
the
days
of
meneptah
the
successor
of
ramses
ii
just
as
in
the
later
days
of
the
xxvith
dynasty
the
northern
pirates
visited
the
african
shore
of
the
mediterranean
and
in
alliance
with
the
predatory
libyans
attacked
egypt
petrie
has
lately
history
of
egypt
iii
pp
ill
proffered
an
alternative
view
which
would
make
all
these
tribes
tunisians
and
algerians
thus
disposing
of
the
identification
of
the
akaivasha
with
the
achaians
and
making
them
the
ancient
representatives
of
the
town
of
roman
agbia
in
tunis
but
several
difficulties
might
be
pointed
out
which
are
in
the
way
of
an
acceptance
of
this
view
and
it
is
probable
that
the
older
identifications
with
greek
tribes
must
still
be
retained
so
that
akaivasha
are
evidently
the
ancient
representatives
of
the
achai
v
ans
the
achivi
of
the
roman
poets
the
terminations
and
which
appear
in
these
names
are
merely
ethnic
and
locative
affixes
belonging
to
the
asianic
language
system
spoken
by
these
tribes
at
that
time
to
which
the
language
of
the
minoan
cretans
which
is
written
in
the
knossian
hieroglyphs
belonged
they
existed
in
ancient
lycian
in
the
forms
and
and
we
find
them
enshrined
in
the
asia
minor
terminating
in
and
as
halikarnassos
sagalassos
shakalasha
in
inscription
oroanda
and
labraunda
which
as
we
have
seen
is
the
same
as
the
greek
word
a
word
of
origin
both
meaning
of
the
double
the
identification
of
these
and
terminations
in
the
egyptian
transliterations
of
the
foreign
names
with
the
lycian
affixes
referred
to
was
made
some
five
years
ago
and
is
now
generally
accepted
we
have
then
to
find
the
equivalents
of
these
names
to
strike
off
the
final
termination
as
in
the
case
of
where
akaiva
only
is
the
real
name
and
this
seems
to
be
the
egyptian
equivalent
of
achivi
it
is
strange
to
meet
with
this
great
name
on
an
egyptian
monument
of
the
thirteenth
century
but
yet
not
so
strange
when
we
recollect
that
it
is
precisely
to
that
period
that
greek
legend
refers
the
war
of
troy
which
was
an
attack
by
greek
tribes
from
all
parts
of
the
ægean
upon
the
asianic
city
at
hissarlik
in
the
troad
exactly
parallel

the

philistines
tjakaray
shakalasha
sagalassians
vashasha
and
danauna
or
daanau
in
alliance
with
north
syrian
tribes
the
danauna
are
evidently
the
ancient
representatives
of
the
the
danaans
who
formed
the
bulk
of
the
greek
army
against
troy
under
the
leadership
of
the
achaians
greek
words
like
the
keftiu
the
vashasha
have
been
identified
by
the
writer
with
the
axians
the
greek
word
of
crete
petrie
compares
the
name
of
the
tjakaray
with
that
of
the
modern
place
zakro
in
crete
identifications
with
modern
are
of
doubtful
value
for
instance
we
can
not
but
hold
that
petrie
errs
greatly
in
identifying
the
name
of
the
pidasa
another
tribe
mentioned
in
ramses
time
with
that
of
the
river
pidias
in
cyprus
is
a
purely
modern
corruption
of
the
ancient
pediseus
which
means
the
because
it
flows
through
the
central
plain
of
the
island
from
the
greek
greek
word
if
then
we
make
the
pidasa
cypriotes
we
assume
that
pure
greek
was
spoken
in
cyprus
as
early
as
c
which
is
highly
improbable
the
pidasa
were
probably
pedasians
the
name
of
pisidia
may
be
the
same
by
metathesis
pedasos
is
a
name
always
connected
with
the
much
wandering
tribe
of
the
leleges
they
are
found
in
lakonia
or
in
asia
minor
we
believe
them
to
have
been
known
to
the
egyptians
as
pidasa
the
identification
of
the
tjakaray
with
zakro
is
very
tempting
the
name
was
formerly
identified
with
that
of
the
teukrians
but
the
v
in
the
word
tewpot
lias
always
been
a
in
the
way
perhaps
zakro
is
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
since
the
legendary
teucer
the
archer
was
connected
with
the
eastern
or
eteokretan
end
of
crete
where
zakro
lies
in
mycenæan
times
zakro
was
an
important
place
so
that
the
tjakaray
may
be
the
teukroi
after
all
and
zakro
may
preserve
the
name
at
any
rate
this
identification
is
most
alluring
and
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
other
cumulative
identifications
is
very
probable
but
the
identification
of
the
pidæa
with
the
river
pediæus
in
cyprus
is
neither
alluring
nor
probable
in
the
time
of
ramses
ii
some
of
these
asia
minor
tribes
had
marched
against
egypt
as
allies
of
the
hittites
we
find
among
them
the
luka
or
lycians
the
dardenui
dardanians
who
may
possibly
have
been
at
that
time
in
the
troad
or
elsewhere
for
all
these
tribes
were
certainly
migratory
and
the
masa
perhaps
the
mysians
with
the
cretans
of
ramses
time
must
be
reckoned
the
pulesta
who
are
certainly
the
philistines
then
most
probably
in
course
of
their
traditional
migration
from
crete
to
palestine
in
philistia
recent
excavations
by
welch
have
disclosed
the
unmistakable
presence
of
a
late
mycenæan
culture
and
we
can
only
ascribe
this
to
the
philistines
who
were
of
cretan
origin
thus
we
see
that
all
these
northern
tribal
names
hold
together
with
remarkable
persistence
and
in
fact
refuse
to
be
identified
with
any
tribes
but
those
of
asia
minor
and
the
ægean
in
them
we
see
the
broken
remnants
of
the
old
minoan
keftian
power
driven
hither
and
thither
across
the
seas
by
intestinal
feuds
and
the
skein
of
grievous
wars
till
every
man
of
them
perished
as
homer
says
of
the
heroes
after
the
siege
of
troy
these
were
in
fact
the
wanderings
of
the
heroes
the
period
of
und
which
succeeded
the
great
civilized
epoch
of
minos
and
his
thalassocracy
of
knossos
phaistos
and
the
keftius
on
the
walls
of
the
temple
of

ramses
iii
depicted
the
portraits
of
the
conquered
heroes
who
had
fallen
before
the
egyptian
onslaught
and
he
called
them
heroes
in
egyptian
fully
recognizing
their
berserker
gallantry
above
all
in
interest
are
the
portraits
of
the
philistines
those
greeks
who
at
this
very
time
seized
part
of
palestine
which
takes
its
name
from
them
and
continued
to
exist
there
as
a
separate
people
like
the
normans
in
france
for
at
least
two
centuries
goliath
the
giant
was
then
a
greek
certainly
he
was
of
cretan
descent
and
so
a
pelasgian
such
are
the
conclusions
to
which
modern
discovery
in
crete
has
impelled
us
with
regard
to
the
pictures
of
the
keftiu
at
shêkh
it
is
indeed
a
new
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
relations
of
ancient
egypt
with
the
outside
world
that
arthur
evans
has
opened
for
us
and
in
this
connection
some
american
work
must
not
be
overlooked
an
expedition
sent
out
by
the
university
of
pennsylvania
under
miss
harriet
boyd
has
discovered
much
of
importance
to
mycenæan
study
in
the
ruins
of
an
ancient
town
at
gournia
in
crete
east
of
knossos
here
however
little
has
been
found
that
will
bear
directly
on
the
question
of
relations
between
mycenaean
greece
and
egypt
the
theban
nécropoles
of
the
new
empire
are
by
no
means
exhausted
by
a
description
of
the
tombs
of
the
kings
and
shêkh
but
few
new
discoveries
have
been
made
anywhere
except
in
the
picturesque
valley
of
the
tombs
of
the
queens
south
of
shêkh
here
the
italian
egyptologist
schiaparelli
has
lately
discovered
and
excavated
some
very
fine
tombs
of
the
xixth
and
xxth
dynasties
the
best
is
that
of
queen
nefertari
one
of
the
wives
of
ramses
ii
the
colouring
of
the
reliefs
upon
these
walls
is
extraordinarily
bright
and
the
portraits
of
the
queen
who
has
a
very
beautiful
face
with
aquiline
nose
are
wonderfully
preserved
she
was
of
the
dark
type
while
another
queen
titi
by
name
who
was
buried
close
by
was
fair
and
had
a
retroussé
nose
schiaparelli
also
discovered
here
the
tombs
of
some
princes
of
the
xxth
dynasty
who
died
young
all
the
tombs
are
much
alike
with
a
single
short
gallery
on
the
walls
of
which
are
mythological
scenes
figures
of
the
prince
and
of
his
father
the
king
painted
in
a
crude
style
which
shows
a
great
degeneration
from
that
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
tombs
we
now
leave
the
great
necropolis
and
turn
to
the
later
temples
of
the
western
bank
at
thebes
these
were
of
a
funerary
character
like
those
of
dêr
already
described
the
most
imposing
of
all
in
some
respects
is
the
ramesseum
where
lies
the
huge
granite
colossus
of
ramses
ii
prostrate
and
broken
which
diodorus
knew
as
the
statue
of
osymandyas

name
is
a
late
corruption
of
ramses
pronounced
ûsimare
the
temple
has
been
cleared
by
howard
carter
for
the
egyptian
government
and
the
small
town
of
houses
magazines
and
cellars
to
the
west
of
it
has
been
excavated
by
him
this
is
quite
a
little
pompeii
with
its
small
streets
its
houses
with
the
stucco
still
clinging
to
the
walls
its
public
altar
its
market
colonnade
and
its
gallery
of
statues
the
statues
are
only
of
brick
like
the
walls
and
roughly
shaped
and
plastered
but
they
were
portraits
undoubtedly
of
celebrities
of
the
time
though
we
do
not
know
of
whom
on
either
side
are
the
long
magazines
in
which
were
kept
the
possessions
of
the
priests
of
the
ramesseum

grain

the
lands
with
which
they
were
endowed
and
everything
meet
to
be
offered
to
the
ghost
of
the
king
whom
they
served
the
plan
of
the
place
had
evidently
been
altered
after
the
time
of
ramses
ii
as
remains
of
overbuilding
were
found
here
and
there
the
magazines
were
first
investigated
in
by
petrie
who
also
found
in
the
neighbourhood
the
remains
of
a
number
of
small
royal
funerary
temples
of
the
xviiith
dynasty

looking
in
the
direction

prejudices
become

excavating

the
temple
had
always
been
remarkable
on

of
the
prodigious
number
of
seated
figures
of
the
goddess
sekhemet

pakhet
which
it
contains
dedicated
by

found
many
more
of
them

also
some
very
interesting
of
the
late
period

had
been

most
important
of

this
speculation
is
a
dangerous
one

similar
speculation
that
the
wonderful
of
an
old
man
found
by

of
her

of
philistine
type
we
have
only
to
look
at
the
faces
of
elderly
egyptians
to
see
that
the
types
presented
by
mentuemhat
and
miss
need
be
nothing
but
pure
egyptian
the
whole
work
of
the
clearing
was
most
efficiently
carried
out
and
the
cairo
museum
obtained
from
it
some
valuable
specimens
of

the

temple
of
karnak

one
of
the
chief
cares
of
the
egyptian
department
of
antiquities
its
paramount
importance
so
to
speak
as
the
cathedral
temple
of
egypt
renders
its
preservation
and
exploration
a
work
of
constant
necessity
and
its
great
extent
makes
this
work
one
which
is
always
going
on
and
which
probably
will
be
going
on
for
many
years
to
come
the
temple
of
karnak
has
cost
the
egyptian
government
much
money
yet
not
a
piastre
of
this
can
be
grudged
for
several
years
past
the
works
have
been
under
the
charge
of
georges
legrain
the
engineer
and
draughtsman
who
was
associated
with
de
morgan
in
the
work
at
dashûr
his
task
is
to
clear
out
the
whole
temple
thoroughly
to
discover
in
it
what
previous
investigators
have
left
undiscovered
and
to
restore
to
its
original
position
what
has
fallen
illustration
the
great
temple
op
kaknak
the
obelisk
is
the
highest
in
egypt
and
was
erected
by
hatshepsu
the
obelisk
was
put
up
by
thothmes
iii
no
general
work
of
restoration
is
contemplated
nor
would
this
be
in
the
slightest
degree
desirable
up
to
the
present
legrain
has
certainly
carried
out
all
three
branches
of
his
task
with
great
success
an
unforeseen
event
has
however
considerably
complicated
and
retarded
the
work
in
october
one
of
the
columns
of
the
side
aisles
of
the
great
hypostyle
hall
fell
bringing
down
with
it
several
others
the
whole
place
was
a
chaotic
ruin
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
of
the
great
hall
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
would
collapse
the
disaster
was
due
to
the
gradual
infiltration
of
water
from
the
nile
beneath
the
structure
whose
foundations
as
is
usual
in
egypt
were
of
the
flimsiest
description
even
the
most
imposing
egyptian
temples
have
foundations
usually
they
are
built
on
the
top
of
the
of
earlier
buildings
of
different
plan
filled
in
with
a
confused
mass
of
earlier
slabs
and
weak
rubbish
of
all
kinds
had
the
egyptian
buildings
been
built
on
sure
foundations
they
would
have
been
preserved
to
a
much
greater
extent
even
than
they
are
in
such
a
climate
as
that
of
egypt
a
stone
building
well
built
should
last
for
ever
legrain
has
for
the
last
five
years
been
busy
repairing
the
damage
all
the
fallen
columns
are
now
restored
to
the
perpendicular
and
the
capitals
and
architraves
are
in
process
of
being
hoisted
into
their
original
positions
the
process
by
which
legrain
carries
out
this
work
has
been
already
described
he
works
in
the
old
egyptian
fashion
building
great
inclines
or
ramps
of
earth
up
which
the
the
capitals
and
the
are
hauled
by
manual
labour
and
then
swung
into
position
this
is
the
way
in
which
the
egyptians
built
karnak
and
in
this
way
too
is
rebuilding
it
it
is
a
slow
process
but
a
sure
one
and
now
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
shall
see
the
hall
except
its
roof
in
much
the
same
condition
as
it
was
when
seti
built
it
lovers
of
the
picturesque
will
however
miss
the
famous
leaning
column
hanging
poised
across
the
hall
which
has
been
a
main
feature
in
so
many
pictures
and
photographs
of
karnak
this
fell
in
the
catastrophe
of
and
naturally
it
has
not
been
possible
to
restore
it
to
its
picturesque
but
dangerous
position
the
work
at
karnak
has
been
distinguished
during
the
last
two
years
by
two
remarkable
discoveries
outside
the
main
temple
to
the
north
of
the
hypostyle
hall
legrain
found
a
series
of
private
sanctuaries
or
shrines
built
of
brick
by
personages
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
and
later
in
order
to
testify
their
devotion
to
amen
in
these
small
cells
were
found
some
remarkable
statues
one
of
which
is
illustrated
it
is
one
of
the
most
perfect
of
its
kind
a
great
dignitary
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
is
seen
seated
with
his
wife
their
daughter
standing
between
them
round
his
neck
are
four
chains
of
golden
rings
with
which
he
had
been
decorated
by
the
pharaoh
for
his
services
it
is
a
remarkable
group
interesting
for
its
style
and
workmanship
as
well
as
for
its
subject
as
an
example
of
the
formal
hieratic
type
of
portraiture
it
is
very
fine
the
other
and
more
important
discovery
of
the
two
was
made
by
legrain
on
the
south
side
of
the
hall
illustration
the
great
temple
op
kaknak
the
obelisk
is
the
highest
in

and
was
erected
by

put
up

excavations
begun
in
an
unoccupied
tract
under
the
wall
of

hall
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
parts
of

the
place
was

some

the

unusual

is

very
much
to
the

we
finish
our
account
of
the
new
discoveries
in
the
chief
city
of
ancient
egypt
as
we
began
it
with
the
work
of
naville
in
the
oldest
temple
there
one
of
the
most
interesting
questions
connected
with
the
archaeology
of
thebes
is
that
which
asks
whether
the
heretical
akhunaten
amenhetep
iv
erected
buildings
there
and
whether
any
trace
of
them
has
ever
been
discovered
to
those
who
are
interested
in
egyptian
history
and
religion
the
transitory
episode
of
the
heresy
is
already
familiar
the
precise
character
of
the
heretical
dogma
which
amenhetep
iv
proclaimed
and
desired
his
subjects
to
accept
has
lately
been
well
explained
by
de
garis
davies
in
his
volumes
published
by
the
survey
of
branch
of
the
egypt
exploration
fund
on
the
tombs
of
he
shows
that
the
heretical
doctrine
was
a
monotheism
of
a
very
high
order
amenhetep
iv
or
as
he
preferred
to
call
himself
akhunaten
of
the
did
not
as
has
usually
been
supposed
merely
worship
the
itself
as
the
giver
of
life
and
nothing
more
he
venerated
the
glowing
disk
merely
as
the
visible
emanation
of
the
deity
behind
it
who
dispensed
heat
and
life
to
all
living
things
through
its
medium
the
disk
was
so
to
speak
the
window
in
heaven
through
which
the
unknown
god
the
of
the
disk
shed
a
portion
of
his
radiance
on
the
world
now
given
an
ignorance
of
the
true
astronomical
character
of
the
sun
we
see
how
eminently
rational
a
religion
this
was
in
effect
the
sun
is
the
source
of
all
life
upon
this
earth
and
so
akhunaten
caused
its
rays
to
be
depicted
each
with
a
hand
holding
out
the
sign
of
life
to
the
earth
the
monotheistic
worship
of
the
sun
alone
is
certainly
the
highest
form
of
pagan
religion
but
akhunaten
saw
further
than
this
his
doctrine
was
that
there
was
a
deity
behind
the
sun
whose
glory
shone
through
it
and
gave
us
life
this
deity
was
unnamed
and
unnamable
he
was
lord
of
the
we
see
in
his
heresy
therefore
the
highest
attitude
to
which
religious
ideas
had
attained
before
the
days
of
the
hebrew
prophets
this
religion
seems
to
have
been
developed
out
of
the
philosophical
speculations
of
the
priests
of
the
sun
at
heliopolis
akhunaten
with
unwise
iconoclastic
zeal
endeavoured
to
root
out
the
worship
of
the
ancient
gods
of
egypt
and
especially
that
of
the
ruler
of
the
egyptian
pantheon
whose
primacy
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
made
him
the
most
redoubtable
rival
of
the
new
doctrine
but
the
name
of
the
old
was
spared
and
it
is
evident
that
akhunaten
regarded
him
as
more
or
less
identical
with
his
god
it
has
been
supposed
by
petrie
that
queen
tii
the
mother
of
akhunaten
was
of
mitannian
armenian
origin
and
that
she
brought
the
aten
religion
to
egypt
from
her
native
land
and
taught
it
to
her
son
certainly
it
seems
as
though
the
new
doctrine
had
made
some
headway
before
the
death
of
amenhetep
iii
but
we
have
no
reason
to
attribute
it
to
tii
or
to
suppose
that
she
brought
it
with
her
from
abroad
there
is
no
proof
whatever
that
she
was
not
a
native
egyptian
and
the
mummies
of
her
parents
iuaa
and
tuaa
are
purely
egyptian
in
facial
type
it
seems
undoubted
that
the
aten
cult
was
a
development
of
pure
egyptian
religious
thought
at
first
akhunaten
tried
to
establish
his
religion
at
thebes
alongside
that
of
amen
and
his
attendant
pantheon
he
seems
to
have
built
a
temple
to
the
aten
there
and
we
see
that
his
courtiers
began
to
make
tombs
for
themselves
in
the
new
realistic
style
of
sculptural
art
which
the
king
heretical
in
art
as
in
religion
had
introduced
the
tomb
of
barnes
at
shêkh
has
on
one
side
of
the
door
a
representation
of
the
king
in
the
old
regular
style
and
on
the
other
side
one
in
the
new
realistic
style
which
depicts
him
in
all
the
native
ugliness
in
which
this
strange
man
seems
to
have
positively
gloried
we
find
too
that
he
caused
a
temple
to
the
aten
to
be
erected
in
napata
the
capital
of
nubia
by
jebel
barkal
in
the
sudan
the
facts
as
to
the
theban
and
napata
temples
have
been
pointed
out
by
breasted
of
chicago
but
the
opposition
of
the
theban
priesthood
was
too
strong
akhunaten
shook
the
dust
of
the
capital
off
his
feet
and
retired
to
the
isolated
city
of
glory
of
the
disk
at
the
modern
tell
where
he
could
philosophize
in
peace
while
his
kingdom
was
left
to
take
care
of
itself
he
and
his
wife
who
seems
to
have
been
a
faithful
sharer
of
his
views
reigned
over
a
select
court
of
nobles
priests
and
artists
the
artists
had
under
akhunaten
an
unrivalled
opportunity
for
development
of
which
they
had
already
begun
to
take
considerable
advantage
before
the
end
of
his
reign
and
the
restoration
of
the
old
order
of
ideas
their
style
takes
on
itself
an
almost
bizarre
freedom
which
reminds
us
strongly
of
the
similar
characteristic
in
mycenaean
art
there
is
a
strange
little
relief
in
the
berlin
museum
of
the
king
standing
leaning
on
a
staff
and
languidly
smelling
a
flower
while
the
queen
stands
by
with
her
garments
blown
about
by
the
wind
the
artistic
graceful
attitude
is
probably
a
faithful
transcript
of
a
characteristic
pose
we
see
from
this
what
an
egyptian
artist
could
do
when
his
shackles
were
removed
but
unluckily
egypt
never
produced
another
king
who
was
at
the
same
time
an
original
genius
an
artist
and
a
thinker
when
akhunaten
died
the
egyptian
shackles
were
riveted
tighter
than
ever
the
reaction
was
strong
the
kingdom
had
fallen
into
anarchy
and
the
foreign
empire
which
his
predecessors
had
built
up
had
practically
been
thrown
to
the
winds
by
akhunaten
the
whole
is
an
example
of
the
confusion
and
disorganization
which
ensue
when
a
philosopher
rules
not
long
after
the
death
the
old
religion
was
fully
restored
the
cult
of
the
disk
was
blotted
out
and
the
egyptians
returned
joyfully
to
the
worship
of
their
myriad
deities
ideals
were
too
high
for
them
the
débris
of
the
foreign
empire
was
as
usual
in
such
cases
put
together
again
and
customary
law
and
order
restored
by
the
conservative
reactionaries
who
succeeded
him
henceforth
egyptian
civilization
runs
an
uninspired
and
undeveloping
course
till
the
days
of
the
saïtes
and
the
ptolemies
this
point
in
the
history
of
egypt
therefore
forms
a
convenient
at
which
to
pause
while
we
turn
once
more
to
western

to

extent
recent

the
assyrian
and
empires
in
the
light
of
recent
research
the
early
history
of
assyria
has
long
been
a
subject
on
which
historians
were
obliged
to
trust
largely
to
conjecture
in
their
attempts
to
reconstruct
the
stages
by
which
its
early
rulers
obtained
their
independence
and
laid
the
foundations
of
the
mighty
empire
over
which
their
successors
ruled
that
the
land
was
colonized
from
babylonia
and
was
at
first
ruled
as
a
dependency
of
the
southern
kingdom
have
long
been
regarded
as
established
facts
but
until
recently
little
was
known
of
its
early
rulers
and
governors
and
still
less
of
the
condition
of
the
country
and
its
capital
during
the
early
periods
of
their
existence
since
the
excavations
carried
out
by
the
british
museum
at
kala
sherghat
on
the
western
bank
of
the
tigris
it
has
been
known
that
the
mounds
at
that
spot
mark
the
site
of
the
city
of
ashur
the
first
capital
of
the
assyrians
and
the
monuments
and
records
recovered
during
those
excavations
have
hitherto
formed
our
principal
source
of
information
for
the
early
history
of
the
country
some
of
the
oldest
records
found
in
the
course
of
these
excavations
were
short
votive
texts
inscribed
by
rulers
who
bore
the
title
of
corresponding
to
the
sumerian
and
early
babylonian
title
of
patesi
and
with
some
such
meaning
as
it
was
rightly
conjectured
from
the
title
which
they
bore
that
these
early
rulers
owed
allegiance
to
the
kings
of
babylon
and
were
their
nominees
or
at
any
rate
their
tributaries
the
names
of
a
few
of
these
early
viceroys
were
recovered
from
their
votive
inscriptions
and
from
notices
in
later
historical
texts
but
it
was
obvious
that
our
knowledge
of
early
assyrian
history
would
remain
very
fragmentary
until
systematic
excavations
in
assyria
were
resumed
three
years
ago
the
british
museum
resumed
excavations
at
kuyunjik
the
site
of
nineveh
the
work
was
begun
and
carried
out
under
the
direction
of
king
but
since
last
summer
has
been
continued
by
thompson
last
year
too
excavations
were
reopened
at
sherghat
by
the
at
first
under
the
direction
of
koldewey
and
afterwards
under
that
of
andrae
by
whom
they
are
at
present
being
carried
on
this
renewed
activity
on
the
sites
of
the
ancient
cities
of
assyria
is
already
producing
results
of
considerable
interest
and
the
veil
which
has
so
long
concealed
the
earlier
periods
in
the
history
of
that
country
is
being
lifted
for
the
texts
and
translations
of
these
documents

and
king
annals
of
the
kings
of
assyria
pp
iff
shortly
before
these
excavations
in
assyria
were
set
on
foot
an
indication
was
obtained
from
an
early
babylonian
text
that
the
history
of
assyria
as
a
dependent
state
or
province
of
babylon
must
be
pushed
back
to
a
far
more
remote
period
than
had
hitherto
been
supposed
in
one
of
letters
to
governor
of
the
city
of
larsam
to
which
reference
has
already
been
made
directions
are
given
for
the
despatch
to
the
king
of
hundred
and
forty
men
of
under
the
command
of
who
have
left
the
country
of
ashur
and
the
district
of
from
this
most
interesting
reference
it
followed
that
the
country
to
the
north
of
babylonia
was
known
as
assyria
at
the
time
of
the
kings
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
and
the
fact
that
babylonian
troops
were
stationed
there
by
hammurabi
proved
that
the
country
formed
an
integral
part
of
the
babylonian
empire
these
conclusions
were
soon
after
strikingly
confirmed
by
two
passages
in
the
introductory
sections
of
code
of
laws
which
was
discovered
at
susa
here
hammurabi
records
that
he
his
the
god
protecting
image
unto
the
city
of
ashur
and
a
few
lines
farther
on
he
describes
himself
as
the
king
hath
made
the
names
of
ishtar
glorious
in
the
city
of
nineveh
in
the
temple
of
that
ashur
should
be
referred
to
at
this
period
is
what
we
might
expect
inasmuch
as
it
was
known
to
have
been
the
earliest
capital
of
assyria
more
striking
is
the
reference
to
nineveh
proving
as
it
does
that
it
was
a
flourishing
city
in
time
and
that
the
temple
of
ishtar
there
had
already
been
long
established
it
is
true
that
gudea
the
sumerian
patesi
of
shirpurla
records
that
he
rebuilt
the
temple
of
the
goddess
ninni
ishtar
at
a
place
called
nina
now
nina
may
very
probably
be
identified
with
nineveh
but
many
writers
have
taken
it
to
be
a
place
in
southern
babylonia
and
possibly
a
district
of
shirpurla
itself
no
such
uncertainty
attaches
to
reference
to
nineveh
which
is
undoubtedly
the
assyrian
city
of
that
name
although
no
account
has
yet
been
published
of
the
recent
excavations
carried
out
at
nineveh
by
the
british
museum
they
fully
corroborate
the
inference
drawn
with
regard
to
the
great
age
of
the
city
the
series
of
trenches
which
were
cut
deep
into
the
lower
strata
of
kuyunjik
revealed
numerous
traces
of
very
early
habitations
on
the
mound
neither
in
letters
nor
upon
the
stele
inscribed
with
his
code
of
laws
is
any
reference
made
to
the
contemporary
governor
or
ruler
of
assyria
but
on
a
contract
tablet
preserved
in
the
pennsylvania
museum
a
name
has
been
recovered
which
will
probably
be
identified
with
that
of
the
ruler
of
assyria
in
reign
in
legal
and
commercial
documents
of
the
period
of
the
first
dynasty
of
babylon
the
contracting
parties
frequently
swore
by
the
names
of
two
gods
usually
shamash
and
marduk
and
also
that
of
the
reigning
king
now
it
has
been
found
by
banke
that
on
this
document
in
the
pennsylvania
museum
the
contracting
parties
swear
by
the
name
of
hammurabi
and
also
by
that
of
as
only
gods
and
kings
are
mentioned
in
the
oath
formulas
of
this
period
it
follows
that
was
a
king
or
at
any
rate
a
patesi
or
ishshakku
now
from
its
form
the
name
must
be
that
of
an
assyrian
not
that
of
a
babylonian
and
since
he
is
associated
in
the
oath
formula
with
hammurabi
it
is
legitimate
to
conclude
that
he
governed
assyria
in
the
time
of
hammurabi
as
a
dependency
of
babylon
an
early
assyrian
ishshakku
of
this
name
who
was
the
son
of
is
mentioned
by
i
but
he
can
not
be
identified
with
the
ruler
of
the
time
of
hammurabi
since
according
to
he
ruled
too
late
about
a
of
another
however
the
son
of
is
preserved
in
the
british
museum
and
it
is
probable
that
we
may
identify
him
with
assyrian
viceroy
erishum
and
his
son
ikunum
whose
inscriptions
are
also
preserved
in
the
british
museum
should
certainly
be
assigned
to
an
early
period
of
assyrian
history
the
recent
excavations
at
sherghat
are
already
yielding
the
names
of
other
early
assyrian
viceroys
and
although
the
texts
of
the
inscriptions
in
which
their
names
occur
have
not
yet
been
published
we
may
briefly
enumerate
the
more
important
of
the
discoveries
that
have
been
made
last
year
a
small
cone
or
cylinder
was
found
which
though
it
bears
only
a
few
lines
of
inscription
restores
the
names
of
no
less
than
seven
early
assyrian
viceroys
whose
existence
was
not
previously
known
the
cone
was
inscribed
by
who
gives
his
own
genealogy
and
records
the
restoration
of
the
wall
of
the
city
of
ashur
which
he
states
had
been
rebuilt
by
certain
of
his
predecessors
on
the
throne
the
principal
portion
of
the
inscription
reads
as
follows
the
viceroy
of
the
god
ashir
the
son
of
the
viceroy
of
the
god
ashir
the
son
of
the
viceroy
the
city
wall
which
kikia
ikunum
and
the
son
of
my
forefathers
had
built
was
fallen
and
for
the
preservation
of
my
life
i
rebuilt
perhaps
no
inscription
has
yet
been
recovered
in
either
assyria
or
babylonia
which
contained
so
much
new
information
packed
into
so
small
a
space
of
the
names
of
the
early
viceroys
mentioned
in
it
only
one
was
previously
known
the
name
of
ikunum
the
son
of
erishum
is
found
in
a
late
copy
of
a
votive
text
preserved
in
the
british
museum
thus
from
these
few
lines
the
names
of
three
rulers
in
direct
succession
have
been
recovered
and
and
also
those
of
four
earlier
rulers
kikia
and
his
son
another
interesting
point
about
the
inscription
is
the
spelling
of
the
name
of
the
national
god
of
the
assyrians
in
the
later
periods
it
is
always
written
but
at
this
early
time
we
see
that
the
second
vowel
is
changed
and
that
at
first
the
name
was
written
a
form
that
was
already
known
from
the
cappadocian
cuneiform
inscriptions
the
form
ashir
is
a
good
participial
construction
and
signifies
beneficent
merciful
another
interesting
find
which
was
also
made
last
year
consists
of
four
stone
tablets
each
engraved
with
the
same
of
shalmaneser
i
a
king
who
reigned
over
assyria
about
in
recording
his
rebuilding
of
the
temple
of
the
god
ashur
in
the
city
of
ashur
he
gives
a
brief
summary
of
the
history
with
details
as
to
the
length
of
time
which
elapsed
between
the
different
periods
during
which
it
had
been
previously
restored
the
temple
was
burned
in
time
and
when
recording
this
fact
and
the
putting
out
of
the
fire
he
summarizes
the
history
in
a
long
parenthesis
as
will
be
seen
from
the
following
translation
of
the
extract
the
temple
of
ashur
my
lord
which
ushpia
variant
the
priest
of
ashur
my
forefather
had
built
aforetime
and
it
fell
into
decay
and
erishu
my
forefather
the
priest
of
ashur
rebuilt
it
years
passed
by
after
the
reign
of
erishu
and
that
temple
fell
into
decay
and
the
priest
of
ashur
rebuilt
it
during
years
that
temple
which
the
priest
of
ashur
had
built
grew
hoary
and
old
when
fire
broke
out
in
the
midst
thereof
at
that
time
i
drenched
that
temple
with
water
in
all
its
from
this
extract
it
will
be
seen
that
shalmaneser
gives
us
in
ushpia
or
aushpia
the
name
of
a
very
early
assyrian
viceroy
who
in
his
belief
was
the
founder
of
the
great
temple
of
the
god
ashur
he
also
tells
us
that
years
separated
erishu
from
a
viceroy
named
and
that
years
separated
from
his
own
time
when
these
inscriptions
were
first
found
they
were
hailed
with
considerable
satisfaction
by
historians
as
they
gave
what
seemed
to
be
valuable
information
for
settling
the
chronology
of
the
early
patesis
but
confidence
in
the
accuracy
of
reckoning
was
somewhat
shaken
a
few
months
afterwards
by
the
discovery
of
a
prism
of
esarhaddon
who
gave
in
it
a
history
of
the
same
temple
but
ascribed
totally
different
figures
for
the
periods
separating
the
reigns
of
erishu
and
and
the
destruction
by
fire
esarhaddon
agrees
with
shalmaneser
in
ascribing
the
founding
of
the
temple
to
ushpia
but
he
states
that
only
years
instead
of
years
separated
erishu
whom
he
spells
irishu
the
son
of
from
the
son
of
and
he
adds
that
years
instead
of
years
elapsed
between
restoration
of
the
temple
and
the
time
when
it
was
burned
down
as
shalmaneser
i
lived
over
six
hundred
years
earlier
than
esarhaddon
he
was
obviously
in
a
better
position
to
ascertain
the
periods
at
which
the
events
recorded
took
place
but
the
discrepancy
between
the
figures
he
gives
and
those
of
esarhaddon
is
disconcerting
it
shows
that
assyrian
scribes
could
make
bad
mistakes
in
their
reckoning
and
it
serves
to
cast
discredit
on
the
absolute
accuracy
of
the
chronological
notices
contained
in
other
late
assyrian
inscriptions
so
far
from
helping
to
settle
the
unsolved
problems
of
assyrian
chronology
these
two
recent
finds
at
sherghat
have
introduced
fresh
confusion
and
assyrian
chronology
for
the
earlier
periods
is
once
more
cast
into
the
melting
pot
in
addition
to
the
recovery
of
the
names
of
hitherto
unknown
early
rulers
of
assyria
the
recent
excavations
at
sherghat
have
enabled
us
to
ascertain
the
true
reading
of
the
name
of
shalmaneser
grandfather
who
reigned
a
considerable
time
after
assyria
had
gained
her
independence
the
name
of
this
king
has
hitherto
been
read
as
but
it
is
now
shown
that
the
signs
composing
the
first
part
of
the
name
are
not
to
be
taken
phonetically
but
as
ideographs
the
true
reading
of
the
name
being
the
signification
of
which
is
is
the
judgment
of
was
a
great
conqueror
as
were
his
immediate
descendants
all
of
whom
extended
the
territory
of
assyria
by
strengthening
the
country
and
increasing
her
resources
they
enabled
i
to
achieve
the
conquest
of
babylon
itself
concerning
reign
and
achievements
an
interesting
inscription
has
recently
been
discovered
this
is
now
preserved
in
the
british
museum
and
before
describing
it
we
may
briefly
refer
to
another
phase
of
the
excavations
at
sherghat

a
votive

an

a
great

in
fact
the
existence
of
a
group
of
high
natural
mounds
at
this
point
on
the
bank
of
the
tigris
must
have
led
to
its
selection
by
the
early
assyrians
as
the
site
on
which
to
build
their
first
stronghold
the
mounds
were
already
so
high
from
their
natural
formation
that
there
was
no
need
for
the
later
assyrian
kings
to
increase
their
height
artificially

they
raised
the
chief
at
nineveh

the

only

the

to
add
considerably
to
our
knowledge
of
ancient
assyrian
architecture
the
inscription
of
i
which
was
referred
to
above
as
having
been
recently
acquired
by
the
trustees
of
the
british
museum
affords
valuable
information
for
the
reconstruction
of
the
history
of
assyria
during
the
first
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
it
is
seen
from
the
facts
summarized
that
for
our
knowledge
of
the
earlier
history
of
the
country
we
have
to
depend
to
a
large
extent
on
short
and
votive
texts
supplemented
by
historical
references
in
inscriptions
of
the
later
period
the
only
historical
inscription
of
any
length
belonging
to
the
early
assyrian
period
which
had
been
published
up
to
a
year
ago
was
the
famous
memorial
slab
containing
an
inscription
of
i
which
was
acquired
by
the
late
george
smith
some
thirty
years
ago
although
purchased
in
mosul
the
slab
had
been
found
by
the
natives
in
the
mounds
at
sherghat
for
the
text
engraved
upon
it
in
archaic
assyrian
characters
records
the
restoration
of
a
part
of
the
temple
of
the
god
ashur
in
the
ancient
city
of
ashur
the
first
capital
of
the
assyrians
now
marked
by
the
mounds
of
sherghat
which
have
already
been
described
the
object
of
in
causing
the
memorial
slab
to
be
inscribed
was
to
record
the
restoration
of
the
portion
of
the
temple
which
he
had
rebuilt
but
the
most
important
part
of
the
inscription
was
contained
in
the
introductory
phrases
with
which
the
text
opens
they
recorded
the
conquests
achieved
not
only
by
but
by
his
father
his
grandfather
and
his
they
thus
enabled
the
historian
to
trace
the
gradual
extension
and
consolidation
of
the
assyrian

critical

slab
like
that

was
a
foundation
memorial
intended
to
record
certain
building
operations
carried
out
by
order
of
the
king
the
building
so
commemorated
was
not
the
restoration
of
a
portion
of
a
temple
but
the
founding
of
a
new
city
in
which
the
king
erected
no
less
than
eight
temples
dedicated
to
various
deities
while
he
also
records
that
he
built
a
palace
therein
for
his
own
habitation
that
he
protected
the
city
by
a
strongly
fortified
wall
and
that
he
cut
a
canal
from
the
tigris
by
which
he
ensured
a
continuous
supply
of
fresh
water
these
were
the
facts
which
the
memorial
was
primarily
intended
to
record
but
like
the
text
of
i
the
most
interesting
events
for
the
historian
are
those
referred
to
in
the
introductory
portions
of
the
inscription
before
giving
details
concerning
the
founding
of
the
new
city
named
fortress
of
the
king
supplies
an
account
of
the
military
expeditions
which
he
had
conducted
during
the
course
of
his
reign
up
to
the
time
when
the
foundation
memorial
was
inscribed
these
introductory
paragraphs
record
how
the
king
gradually
conquered
the
peoples
to
the
north
and
northeast
of
assyria
and
how
he
finally
undertook
a
successful
campaign
against
babylon
during
which
he
captured
the
city
and
completely
subjugated
both
northern
and
southern
babylonia
reign
thus
marks
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
his
country
we
have
already
seen
how
during
the
early
ages
of
her
history
assyria
had
been
merely
a
subject
province
of
the
babylonian
empire
her
rulers
had
been
viceroys
owing
allegiance
to
their
overlords
in
babylon
under
whose
orders
they
administered
the
country
while
garrisons
of
babylonian
soldiers
and
troops
commanded
by
babylonian
officers
served
to
keep
the
country
in
a
state
of
subjection
gradually
however
the
country
began
to
feel
her
feet
and
long
for
independence
the
conquest
of
babylon
by
the
kings
of
the
country
of
the
sea
afforded
her
the
opportunity
of
throwing
off
the
babylonian
yoke
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
assyrian
kings
were
powerful
enough
to
have
independent
relations
with
the
kings
of
egypt
and
during
the
two
centuries
which
preceded
reign
relations
with
babylon
were
the
cause
of
constant
friction
due
to
the
northern
growth
in
power
and
influence
the
frontier
between
the
two
countries
was
constantly
in
dispute
and
though
sometimes
rectified
by
treaty
the
claims
of
assyria
often
led
to
war
between
the
two
countries
the
general
result
of
these
conflicts
was
that
assyria
gradually
extended
her
authority
farther
southwards
and
encroached
upon
territory
which
had
previously
been
babylonian
the
successes
gained
by
and
i
against
the
contemporary
babylonian
kings
had
all
resulted
in
the
cession
of
fresh
territory
to
assyria
and
in
an
increase
of
her
international
importance
up
to
the
time
of
no
assyrian
king
had
actually
seated
himself
upon
the
babylonian
throne
this
feat
was
achieved
by
and
his
reign
thus
marks
an
important
step
in
the
gradual
advance
of
assyria
to
the
position
which
she
later
occupied
as
the
predominant
power
in
western
asia
before
undertaking
his
campaign
against
babylon
secured
himself
against
attack
from
other
quarters
and
his
newly
discovered
memorial
inscription
supplies
considerable
information
concerning
the
steps
he
took
to
achieve
this
object
in
his
inscription
the
king
does
not
number
his
military
expeditions
and
with
the
exception
of
the
first
one
he
does
not
state
the
period
of
his
reign
in
which
they
were
undertaken
the
results
of
his
campaigns
are
summarized
in
four
paragraphs
of
the
text
and
it
is
probable
that
they
are
not
described
in
chronological
order
but
are
arranged
rather
according
to
the
geographical
position
of
the
districts
which
he
invaded
and
subdued
records
that
his
first
campaign
took
place
at
the
beginning
of
his
sovereignty
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
and
it
was
directed
against
the
tribes
and
peoples
inhabiting
the
territory
on
the
east
of
assyria
of
the
tribes
which
he
overran
and
conquered
on
this
occasion
the
most
important
was
the
kuti
who
probably
dwelt
in
the
districts
to
the
east
of
the
lower
zâb
they
were
a
turbulent
race
and
they
had
already
been
conquered
by
and
i
but
on
neither
occasion
had
they
been
completely
subdued
and
they
had
soon
regained
their
independence
their
subjugation
by
was
a
necessary
preliminary
to
any
conquest
in
the
south
and
we
can
well
understand
why
it
was
undertaken
by
the
king
at
the
beginning
of
his
reign
other
conquests
which
were
also
made
in
the
same
region
were
the
ukumanî
and
the
lands
of
sharnida
and
mekhri
mountainous
districts
which
probably
lay
to
the
north
of
the
lower
zâb
the
country
of
mekhri
took
its
name
from
the
a
kind
of
pine
or
fir
which
grew
there
in
abundance
upon
the
mountainsides
and
was
highly
esteemed
by
the
assyrian
kings
as
affording
excellent
wood
for
building
purposes
at
a
later
period
invaded
the
country
in
the
course
of
his
campaigns
and
brought
back
beams
of
which
he
used
in
the
construction
of
the
temple
dedicated
to
the
goddess
ishtar
in
nineveh
the
second
group
of
tribes
and
districts
enumerated
by
as
having
been
subdued
in
his
early
years
before
his
conquest
of
babylon
all
lay
probably
to
the
northwest
of
assyria
the
most
powerful
among
these
peoples
were
the
shubari
who
like
the
kutî
on
the
eastern
border
of
assyria
had
already
been
conquered
by
i
but
had
regained
their
independence
and
were
once
more
threatening
the
border
on
this
side
the
third
group
of
his
conquests
consisted
of
the
districts
ruled
over
by
forty
kings
of
the
lands
of
which
was
a
general
term
for
the
mountainous
districts
to
the
north
of
assyria
including
territory
to
the
west
of
lake
van
and
extending
eastwards
to
the
districts
around
lake
urmi
the
forty
kings
in
this
region
whom
boasts
of
having
subdued
were
little
more
than
chieftains
of
the
mountain
tribes
each
one
possessing
authority
over
a
few
villages
scattered
among
the
hills
and
valleys
but
the
men
of
were
a
warlike
and
hardy
race
and
if
left
long
in
undisturbed
possession
of
their
native
fastnesses
they
were
tempted
to
make
raids
into
the
fertile
plains
of
assyria
it
was
therefore
only
politic
for
to
traverse
their
country
with
fire
and
sword
and
by
exacting
heavy
tribute
to
keep
the
fear
of
assyrian
power
before
their
eyes
from
the
records
we
thus
learn
that
he
subdued
and
crippled
the
races
living
on
his
borders
to
the
north
to
the
northwest
and
to
the
east
on
the
west
was
the
desert
from
which
region
he
need
fear
no
organized
attack
when
he
concentrated
his
army
elsewhere
for
his
permanent
garrisons
were
strong
enough
to
repel
and
punish
any
incursion
of
nomadic
tribes
he
was
thus
in
a
position
to
try
conclusions
with
his
hereditary
foe
in
the
south
without
any
fear
of
leaving
his
land
open
to
invasion
in
his
absence
the
campaign
against
babylon
was
the
most
important
one
undertaken
by
and
its
successful
issue
was
the
crowning
point
of
his
military
career
the
king
relates
that
the
great
gods
ashur
bel
and
shamash
and
the
goddess
ishtar
the
queen
of
heaven
and
earth
marched
at
the
head
of
his
warriors
when
he
set
out
upon
the
expedition
after
crossing
the
border
and
penetrating
into
babylonian
territory
he
seems
to
have
had
some
difficulty
in
forcing
bitiliashu
the
kassite
king
who
then
occupied
the
throne
of
babylon
to
a
decisive
engagement
but
by
a
skilful
disposition
of
his
forces
he
succeeded
in
hemming
him
in
so
that
the
babylonian
army
was
compelled
to
engage
in
a
pitched
battle
the
result
of
the
fighting
was
a
complete
victory
for
the
assyrian
arms
many
of
the
babylonian
warriors
fell
fighting
and
bitiliashu
himself
was
captured
by
the
assyrian
soldiers
in
the
midst
of
the
battle
boasts
that
he
trampled
his
lordly
neck
beneath
his
feet
and
on
his
return
to
assyria
he
carried
his
captive
back
in
fetters
to
present
him
with
the
spoils
of
the
campaign
before
ashur
the
national
god
of
the
assyrians
before
returning
to
assyria
however
marched
with
his
army
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
babylonia
and
achieved
the
subjugation
of
the
whole
of
the
sumer
and
akkad
he
destroyed
the
fortifications
of
babylon
to
ensure
that
they
should
not
again
be
used
against
himself
and
all
the
inhabitants
who
did
not
at
once
submit
to
his
decrees
he
put
co
the
sword
he
then
appointed
his
own
officers
to
rule
the
country
and
established
his
own
system
of
administration
adding
to
his
previous
title
of
of
assyria
those
of
of
karduniash
babylonia
and
of
sumer
and
it
was
probably
from
this
period
that
he
also
adopted
the
title
of
of
the
poor
quarters
of
the
as
a
mark
of
the
complete
subjugation
of
their
ancient
foe
and
his
army
carried
back
with
them
to
assyria
not
only
the
captive
babylonian
king
but
also
the
statue
of
marduk
the
national
god
of
babylon
this
they
removed
from
his
sumptuous
temple
in
babylon
and
they
looted
the
sacred
treasures
from
the
and
carried
them
off
together
with
the
spoil
of
the
city
no
doubt
left
a
sufficient
proportion
of
his
army
in
babylon
to
garrison
the
city
and
support
the
governors
and
officials
into
whose
charge
he
committed
the
administration
of
the
land
but
he
himself
returned
to
assyria
with
the
rich
spoil
of
the
campaign
and
it
was
probably
as
a
use
for
this
large
increase
of
wealth
and
material
that
he
decided
to
found
another
city
which
should
bear
his
own
name
and
perpetuate
it
for
future
ages
the
king
records
that
he
undertook
this
task
at
the
bidding
of
bel
the
god
ashur
who
commanded
that
he
should
found
a
new
city
and
build
a
for
him
therein
in
accordance
with
the
desire
of
ashur
and
the
gods
which
was
thus
conveyed
to
him
the
king
founded
the
city
of
and
he
erected
therein
temples
dedicated
not
only
to
ashur
but
also
to
the
gods
adad
and
and
ninib
and
nusku
and
nergal
and
and
the
goddess
ishtar
the
spoils
from
babylon
and
the
temple
treasures
from
were
doubtless
used
for
the
decoration
of
these
temples
and
the
adornment
of
their
shrines
and
the
king
endowed
the
temples
and
appointed
regular
offerings
which
he
ordained
should
be
their
property
for
ever
he
also
built
a
sumptuous
palace
for
his
own
abode
when
he
stayed
in
the
city
which
he
constructed
on
a
mound
or
terrace
of
earth
faced
with
brick
and
piled
high
above
the
level
of
the
city
finally
he
completed
its
fortification
by
the
erection
of
a
massive
wall
around
it
and
the
completion
of
this
wall
was
the
occasion
on
which
his
memorial
tablet
was
inscribed
the
memorial
tablet
was
buried
and
bricked
up
within
the
actual
structure
of
the
wall
in
order
that
in
future
ages
it
might
be
read
by
those
who
found
it
and
so
it
might
preserve
his
name
and
fame
after
finishing
the
account
of
his
building
operations
in
the
new
city
and
recording
the
completion
of
the
city
wall
from
its
foundation
to
its
coping
stone
the
king
makes
an
appeal
to
any
future
ruler
who
should
find
it
in
the
following
words
the
days
that
are
to
come
when
this
wall
shall
have
grown
old
and
shall
have
fallen
into
ruins
may
a
future
prince
repair
the
damaged
parts
thereof
and
may
he
anoint
my
memorial
tablet
with
oil
and
may
he
offer
sacrifices
and
restore
it
unto
its
place
and
then
ashur
will
hearken
unto
his
prayers
but
whosoever
shall
destroy
this
wall
or
shall
remove
my
memorial
tablet
or
my
name
that
is
inscribed
thereon
or
shall
leave
the
city
of
my
dominion
desolate
or
shall
destroy
it
may
the
lord
ashur
overthrow
his
kingdom
and
may
he
break
his
weapons
and
may
he
cause
his
warriors
to
be
defeated
and
may
he
diminish
his
boundaries
and
may
he
ordain
that
his
rule
shall
be
cut
off
and
on
his
days
may
he
bring
sorrow
and
his
years
may
he
make
evil
and
may
he
blot
out
his
name
and
his
seed
from
the
land
by
such
blessings
and
curses
hoped
to
ensure
the
preservation
of
his
name
and
the
rebuilding
of
his
city
should
it
at
any
time
be
neglected
and
fall
into
decay
curiously
enough
it
was
in
this
very
city
that
met
his
own
fate
less
than
seven
years
after
he
had
founded
it
at
that
time
one
of
his
own
sons
who
bore
the
name
of
conspired
against
his
father
and
stirred
up
the
nobles
to
revolt
the
insurrection
was
arranged
when
was
absent
from
his
capital
and
staying
in
where
he
was
probably
protected
by
only
a
small
bodyguard
the
bulk
of
his
veteran
warriors
remaining
behind
in
garrison
at
ashur
the
insurgent
nobles
headed
by
fell
upon
the
king
without
warning
when
he
was
passing
through
the
city
without
any
suspicion
of
risk
from
a
treacherous
attack
the
king
defended
himself
and
sought
refuge
in
a
neighbouring
house
but
the
conspirators
surrounded
the
building
and
having
forced
an
entrance
slew
him
with
the
sword
thus
perished
in
the
city
he
had
built
and
beautified
with
the
spoils
of
his
campaigns
where
he
had
looked
forward
to
passing
a
peaceful
and
secure
old
age
of
the
fate
of
the
city
itself
we
know
little
except
that
its
site
is
marked
by
a
few
mounds
which
rise
slightly
above
the
level
of
the
surrounding
desert
the
memorial
tablet
only
has
survived
for
some
years
it
rested
undisturbed
in
the
foundations
of
the
wall
of
unburnt
brick
where
it
was
buried

the
completion
of

bearing
an
inscription
of
i
king
of
assyria
about
thence
it
was
removed
by
the
hands
of
modern
arabs
and
it
is
now
preserved
in
the
british
museum
where
the
characters
of
the
inscription
may
be
seen
to
be
as
sharp
and
uninjured
as
on
the
day
when
the
assyrian
graver
inscribed
them
by
order
of
the
king
in
the
account
of
his
first
campaign
which
is
preserved
upon
the
memorial
tablet
it
is
stated
that
the
peoples
conquered
by
brought
their
yearly
tribute
to
the
city
of
ashur
this
fact
is
of
considerable
interest
for
it
proves
that
restored
the
capital
of
assyria
to
the
city
of
ashur
removing
it
from
calah
whither
it
had
been
transferred
by
his
father
shalmaneser
i
the
city
of
calah
had
been
founded
and
built
by
shalmaneser
i
in
the
same
way
that
his
son
built
the
city
of
and
the
building
of
both
cities
is
striking
evidence
of
the
rapid
growth
of
assyria
and
her
need
of
expansion
around
fresh
centres
prepared
for
administration
and
defence
the
shifting
of
the
assyrian
capital
to
calah
by
shalmaneser
i
was
also
due
to
the
extension
of
assyrian
power
in
the
north
in
consequence
of
which
there
was
need
of
having
the
capital
nearer
the
centre
of
the
country
so
enlarged
recovery
of
her
old
position
under
i
was
only
a
temporary
check
to
this
movement
northwards
and
so
long
as
babylon
remained
a
conquered
province
of
the
assyrian
empire
obviously
the
need
for
a
capital
farther
north
than
ashur
would
not
have
been
pressing
illustration
the
ziggurat
or
temple

of
the
assyrian
city
of
calah
but
with
death
babylon
regained
her
independence
and
freed
herself
from
assyrian
control
and
the
centre
of
the
northern
kingdom
was
once
more
subject
to
the
influences
which
eventually
resulted
in
the
permanent
transference
of
her
capital
to
nineveh
to
the
comparative
neglect
into
which
ashur
and
calah
consequently
fell
we
may
probably
trace
the
extensive
remains
of
buildings
belonging
to
the
earlier
periods
of
assyrian
history
which
have
been
recovered
and
still
remain
to
be
found
in
the
mounds
that
mark
their
sites
we
have
given
some
account
of
the
results
already
achieved
from
the
excavations
carried
out
during
the
last
two
years
at
sherghat
the
site
of
the
city
of
ashur
that
much
remains
to
be
done
on
the
site
of
calah
the
other
early
capital
of
assyria
is
evident
from
even
a
cursory
examination
of
the
present
condition
of
the
mounds
that
mark
the
location
of
the
city
these
mounds
are
now
known
by
the
name
of
nimrûd
and
are
situated
on
the
left
or
eastern
bank
of
the
tigris

short
distance
above
the
point
at
which
it
is
joined
by
the
stream
of
the
upper
zâb
and
the
great
mound
which
still
covers
the
remains
of
the
ziggurat
or
temple

be
seen
from
a
considerable
distance
across
the
plain
during
the
excavations
formerly
carried
out
here
for
the
british
museum
remains
of
palaces
were
recovered
which
had
been
built
or
restored
by
i
shalmaneser
ii
iii
sargon
esarhaddon
and
after
the
conclusion
of
the
diggings
and
the
removal
of
many
of
the
sculptures
to
england
the
site
was
covered
again
with
earth
in
order
to
protect
the
remains
of
assyrian
buildings
which
were
left
in
place
since
that
time
the
soil
has
sunk
and
been
washed
away
by
the
rains
so
that
many
of

larger
sculptures
are
now
protruding
above
the
soil
an
example
of
which
is
seen
in
the
two
winged
bulls
in
the
palace
of
it
is
improbable
that
the
mounds
of
nimrûd
will
yield
such
rich
results
as
sherghat
but
the
site
would
probably
well
repay
prolonged
and
systematic
excavation

have
hitherto
summarized
and
described
the
principal
facts
with
regard
to
the
early
history
of

it
is
possible
for
the
archaeologist
to
draw
conclusions
with

to
the
customs
of
these
early
peoples

from
a
study
of
their
style

workmanship

of
such
examples

have
been
brought
to

which
they

thousands
of

for
the
history
of

of
the
other
nations
in
the
north
there
is
still
another
source
of
information
to
which
reference
must
now
be
made
the
kings
of
assyria

not
content
with
recording
their
achievements

of
their
buildings

up

also
left
records
graven
in

the

have
formed
an
impregnable

complete
collection
of
these
texts

with
translations

shortly
be
published
by
lehmann
meanwhile
this
scholar
has
discussed
and
summarized
the
results
to
be
obtained
from
much
of
his
material
and
we
are
thus
already
enabled
to
sketch
the
principal
achievements
of
the
rulers
of
this
mountain
race
who
were
constantly
at
war
with
the
later
kings
of
assyria
and
for
two
centuries
at
least
disputed
her
claim
to
supremacy
in
this
portion
of
western
asia
the
country
occupied
by
this
ancient
people

van

the
great

now
forms
armenia
the
people
themselves
can
not
be
connected
with
the
armenians
for
their
language
presents
no
characteristics
of
those
of
the
family
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
they
are
not
to
be
traced
to
a
semitic
origin
it
is
true
that
they
employed
the
assyrian
method
of
writing
their
inscriptions
and
their
art
differs
only
in
minor
points
from
that
of
the
assyrians
but
in
both
instances
this
similarity
of
culture
was
directly
borrowed
at
a
time
when
the
less
civilized
race
having
its
centre
at
van
came
into
direct
contact
with
the
assyrians

the
exact
date
at
which
this
influence
began
to
be
exerted
is
not
certain
but
we
have
records
of
immediate
relations
with
assyria
in
the
second
half
of
the
ninth
century
before
christ
the
district
inhabited
by
the
vannic
people
was
known
to
the
assyrians
by
the
name
of
urartu
and
although
the
inscriptions
of
the
earlier
assyrian
kings
do
not
record
expeditions
against
that
country
they
frequently
make
mention
of
campaigns
against
princes
and
petty
rulers
of
the
land
of
they
must
therefore
for
long
have
exercised
an
indirect
if
not
a
direct
influence
on
the
peoples
and
tribes

lay

the
north

earliest
evidence
of
direct
contact
between
the
assyrians
and
the
land

we
at
present
possess
dates
from
the
reign
of
and
in
the
reign
of
his
son
shalmaneser

three
expeditions
were
undertaken
against
the
people

name

the
king

this
time
was
arame

his
capital

lay
to
the
north
of

on
all
three
occasions
the
assyrians
were
victorious
forcing
arame
to
abandon
his
capital
and
capturing
his
cities

far
as
the
sources
of
the
euphrates

in
the
year
shalmaneser

made
another
attack
upon
the
country
which
at
that
time
was
under
the
sway
of
sarduris
i
under
this
monarch
the
citadel
of
van
became
the
great
stronghold
of
the
people
of
urartu
for
he
added
to
the
natural
strength
of
the
position
by
the
construction
of
walls

between
the
rock

van
and
the
harbour
the
massive
blocks
of
stone
of
which
his
fortifications
were
composed
are
standing
at
the
present
day
and
they
bear
eloquent
testimony
to
the
energy
with
which
this
monarch
devoted
himself
to
the
task
of
rendering

new

carried
on

that
when
iii
brought
fire
and

laid
siege
to

reign

not
capture

of
the
ancient
fortifications
of
the
city

was
not
difficult
for
the
assyrian
king
to
assault
and
capture
the
city
itself
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
citadel
as
it
does
at
the

palace

a
temple
and
around
them
he
constructed
a
new
city
with
a
reservoir
to
supply
it
with
water
possibly
because
the
slopes
of

rendered
it
easier
of
defence

main
facts

history

later
kings
and
of

during
the
and
persian
periods
were
many
years
ago
correctly
ascertained
and
recent
excavation
and
research
have
done
little
to
add
to
our
knowledge
of
the
history
of
these
periods
it
was
hoped
that
the
excavations
conducted
by
koldewey
at
babylon
would
result
in
the
recovery
of
a
wealth
of
inscriptions
and
records
referring
to
the
later
history
of
the
country
but
unfortunately
comparatively
few
tablets
or
inscriptions
have
been
found
and
those
that
have
been
recovered
consist
mainly
of
and
votive
texts
one
such
contains
an
interesting
historical
reference
it
occurs
on
a
of
clay
inscribed
with
a
text
of
nabopolassar
and
it
was
found
in
the
temple
of
ninib
and
records
the
completion
and
restoration
of
the
temple
by
the
king
in
addition
to
recording
the
building
operations
he
had
carried
out
in
the
temple
nabopolassar
boasts
of
his
opposition
to
the
assyrians
he
says
for
the
assyrians
who
had
ruled
all
peoples
from
distant
days
and
had
set
the
people
of
the
land
under
a
heavy
yoke
i
the
weak
and
humble
man
who
worshippeth
the
lord
of
lords
the
god
marduk
through
the
mighty
power
of
nabû
and
marduk
my
lords
held
back
their
feet
from
the
land
of
akkad
and
cast
off
their
it
is
not
yet
certain
whether
the
babylonians
under
nabopolassar
actively
assisted
cyaxares
and
the
medes
in
the
siege
and
in
the
subsequent
capture
of
nineveh
in
but
this
newly
discovered
reference
to
the
assyrians
by
nabopolassar
may
possibly
be
taken
to
imply
that
the
babylonians
were
passive
and
not
active
allies
of
cyaxares
if
the
cylinder
were
inscribed
after
the
fall
of
nineveh
we
should
have
expected
nabopolassar
had
he
taken
an
active
part
in
the
capture
of
the
city
to
have
boasted
in
more
definite
terms
of
his
achievement
on
his
stele
which
is
preserved
at
constantinople
nabonidus
the
last
king
of
the
empire
who
himself
suffered
defeat
at
the
hands
of
cyrus
king
of
persia
ascribed
the
fall
of
nineveh
to
the
anger
of
marduk
and
the
other
gods
of
babylon
because
of
the
destruction
of
their
city
and
the
spoliation
of
their
temples
by
sennacherib
in
we
see
the
irony
of
fate
in
the
fact
that
cyrus
also
ascribed
the
defeat
and
deposition
of
nabonidus
and
the
fall
of
babylon
to
intervention
whose
anger
he
alleges
was
aroused
by
the
attempt
of
nabonidus
to
concentrate
the
worship
of
the
local
in
babylon
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
recent
excavation
and
research
have
not
yet
supplied
the
data
for
filling
in
such
gaps
as
still
remain
in
our
knowledge
of
the
later
history
of
assyria
and
babylon
the
closing
years
of
the
assyrian
empire
and
the
military
achievements
of
the
great
rulers
nabopolassar
and
nebuchadnezzar
ii
have
not
yet
been
found
recorded
in
any
published
assyrian
or
babylonian
inscription
but
it
may
be
expected
that
at
any
moment
some
text
will
be
discovered
that
will
throw
light
upon
the
problems
connected
with
the
history
of
those
periods
which
still
await
solution
meanwhile
the
excavations
at
babylon
although
they
have
not
added
much
to
our
knowledge
of
the
later
history
of
the
country
have
been
of
immense
service
in
revealing
the
topography
of
the
city
during
the
period
as
well
as
the
positions
plans
and
characters
of
the
principal
buildings
erected
by
the
later
babylonian
kings
the
discovery
of
the
palaces
of
nebuchadnezzar
ii
on
the
mound
of
the
kasr
of
the
small
but
complete
temple
of
the
temple
of
the
goddess
to
the
northeast
of
the
palaces
and
of
the
sacred
road
dividing
them
and
passing
through
the
great
gate
of
ishtar
adorned
with
representations
of
lions
bulls
and
dragons
in
raised
brick
upon
its
walls
has
enabled
us
to
form
some
conception
of
the
splendour
and
magnificence
of
the
city
as
it
appeared
when
rebuilt
by
its
last
native
rulers
moreover
the
great
temple
the
famous
shrine
of
the
god
marduk
has
been
identified
and
partly
excavated
beneath
the
huge
mound
of
tell
amran
while
a
smaller
and
less
famous
temple
of
ninib
has
been
discovered
in
the
lower
mounds
which
lie
to
the
eastward
finally
the
sacred
way
from
to
the
palace
mound
has
been
traced
and
uncovered
we
are
thus
enabled
to
reconstitute
the
scene
of
the
most
solemn
rite
of
the
babylonian
festival
of
the
new
year
when
the
statue
of
the
god
marduk
was
carried
in
solemn
procession
along
this
road
from
the
temple
to
the
palace
and
the
babylonian
king
made
his
yearly
obeisance
to
the
national
god
placing
his
own
hands
within
those
of
marduk
in
token
of
his
submission
to
and
dependence
on
the
divine
will

the
last
years
of
the
babylonian
empire
research
among
the
tablets
dating
from
the
and
persian
periods
has
lately
added
considerably
to
our
knowledge
of
babylonian
literature
these
periods
were
marked
by
great
literary
activity
on
the
part
of
the
priests
at
babylon
sippar
and
elsewhere
who
under
the
royal
orders
scoured
the
country
for
all
remains
of
the
early
literature
which
was
preserved
in
the
ancient
temples
and

of
the
country

made

of
these

containing
copies
of

literary
texts

preserved

have
been

have
thus

this

we
may
here
note
that
discovery

its
relation
to

ruled
at

produced

rather

exceed

successors
of
ramses
iii
by
the
time
of
the
of
thebes
the
xxist
dynasty
the
authority
of
the
pharaohs
had
ceased
to
be
exercised
in
syria
egypt
was
itself
divided
into
two
kingdoms
the
one
ruled
by
northern
descendants
of
the
ramessids
at
tanis
the
other
by
the
priestly
monarchs
at
thebes
who
reigned
by
right
of
inheritance
as
a
result
of
the
marriage
of
the
daughter
of
ramses
with
the
high
priest
amenhetep
father
of
herhor
the
first
the
thebans
fortified
gebelên
in
the
south
and
in
the
north
against
attack
and
evidently
their
relations
with
the
tanites
were
not
always
friendly
in
syria
nothing
of
the
imperial
power
remained
the
prestige
of
the
god
amen
of
thebes
however
was
still
very
great
we
see
this
clearly
from
a
very
interesting
papyrus
of
the
reign
of
herhor
published
in
by
golenischeff
which
describes
the
adventures
of
uenuamen
an
envoy
sent
about
to
phoenicia
to
bring
wood
from
the
mountains
of
lebanon
for
the
construction
of
a
great
festival
bark
of
the
god
amen
at
thebes
in
the
course
of
his
mission
he
was
very
badly
treated
we
can
not
well
imagine
thothmes
iii
or
amenhetep
iii
tolerating
of
their
envoy
and
eventually
shipwrecked
on
the
coast
of
the
land
of
alashiya
or
cyprus
he
tells
us
in
the
papyrus
which
seems
to
be
the
official
report
of
his
mission
that
having
been
given
letters
of
credence
to
the
prince
of
byblos
from
the
king
of
tanis
whom
amen
had
given
charge
of
his
he
at
length
reached
phoenicia
and
after
much
discussion
and
argument
was
able
to
prevail
upon
the
prince
to
have
the
wood
which
he
wanted
brought
down
from
lebanon
to
the
seashore
here
however
a
difficulty
presented
itself
the
harbour
was
filled
with
the
piratical
ships
of
the
cretan
tjakaray
who
refused
to
allow
uenuamen
to
return
to
egypt
they
said
him
let
no
ship
of
his
go
unto
the
land
of
egypt
says
uenuamen
in
the
papyrus
sat
down
and
wept
the
scribe
of
the
prince
came
out
unto
me
he
said
unto
me
thee
i
replied
thou
not
the
birds
which
fly
which
fly
back
unto
egypt
look
at
them
they
go
unto
the
cool
canal
and
how
long
do
i
remain
abandoned
here
seest
thou
not
those
who
would
prevent
my
return
he
went
away
and
spoke
unto
the
prince
who
began
to
weep
at
the
words
which
were
told
unto
him
and
which
were
so
sad
he
sent
his
scribe
out
unto
me
who
brought
me
two
measures
of
wine
and
a
deer
he
sent
me
tentnuet
an
egyptian
who
was
with
him
saying
unto
her
unto
him
that
he
may
not
grieve
he
sent
word
unto
me
drink
and
grieve
not
shalt
thou
hear
all
that
i
shall
on
the
morrow
he
had
the
people
of
his
harbour
summoned
and
he
stood
in
the
midst
of
them
and
he
said
unto
the
tjakaray
aileth
you
they
answered
him
will
pursue
the
piratical
ships
which
thou
sendest
unto
egypt
with
our
unhappy
he
said
unto
them
can
not
seize
the
ambassador
of
amen
in
my
land
let
me
send
him
away
and
then
do
ye
pursue
after
him
to
seize
him
he
sent
me
on
board
and
he
sent
me
away
to
the
haven
of
the
sea
the
wind
drove
me
upon
the
land
of
alashiya
the
people
of
the
city
came
out
in
order
to
slay
me
i
was
dragged
by
them
to
the
place
where
hatiba
the
queen
of
the
city
was
i
met
her
as
she
was
going
out
of
one
of
her
houses
into
the
other
i
greeted
her
and
said
unto
the
people
who
stood
by
her
there
not
one
among
you
who
understandeth
the
speech
of
egypt
one
of
them
replied
understand
i
said
unto
him
unto
thy
mistress
even
as
far
as
the
city
in
which
amen
dwelleth
thebes
have
i
heard
the
proverb
all
cities
is
injustice
done
only
in
alashiya
is
justice
to
be
found
and
now
is
injustice
done
here
every
day
she
said
is
it
that
thou
sayest
i
said
unto
her
the
sea
raged
and
the
wind
drove
me
upon
the
land
in
which
thou
livest
therefore
thou
wilt
not
allow
them
to
seize
my
body
and
to
kill
me
for
verily
i
am
an
ambassador
of
amen
remember
that
i
am
one
who
will
be
sought
for
always
and
if
these
men
of
the
prince
of
byblos
whom
they
seek
to
kill
are
killed
verily
if
their
chief
finds
ten
men
of
thine
will
he
not
kill
them
also
she
summoned
the
men
and
they
were
brought
before
her
she
said
unto
me
down
and
sleep
at
this
point
the
papyrus
breaks
off
and
we
do
not
know
how
uenuamen
returned
to
egypt
with
his
wood
the
description
of
his
and
landing
on
alashiya
is
quite
homeric
and
gives
a
vivid
picture
of
the
manners
of
the
time
the
natural
impulse
of
the
islanders
is
to
kill
the
strange
castaway
and
only
the
fear
of
revenge
and
of
the
wrath
of
a
distant
foreign
deity
restrains
them
alashiya
is
probably
cyprus
which
also
bore
the
name
yantinay
from
the
time
of
thothmes
iii
until
the
seventh
century
when
it
is
called
yatnan
by
the
assyrians
a
king
of
alashiya
corresponded
with
amenhetep
iii
in
cuneiform
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
three
hundred
years
before
he
writes
the
small
amount
of
the
copper
which
i
have
sent
thee
be
displeasing
unto
thy
heart
it
is
because
in
my
land
the
hand
of
nergal
my
lord
slew
all
the
men
of
my
land
they
died
of
the
plague
and
there
was
no
working
of
copper
and
this
was
my
brother
not
pleasing
unto
thy
heart
thy
messenger
with
my
messenger
swiftly
will
i
send
and
whatsoever
amount
of
copper
thou
hast
asked
for
o
my
brother
i
even
i
will
send
it
unto
the
mention
by
envoy
of
nesibinebdad
smendes
the
king
of
tanis
a
powerful
ruler
who
in
reality
constantly
threatened
the
existence
of
the
priestly
monarchy
at
thebes
as
to
whom
amen
has
committed
the
wardship
of
his
is
distinctly
amusing
the
hard
fact
of
the
independence
of
lower
egypt
had
to
be
glozed
somehow
the
days
of
theban
power
were
coming
to
an
end
and
only
the
prestige
of
the
god
amen
remained
strong
for
two
hundred
years
more
but
the
alliance
of
amen
and
his
priests
with
a
band
of
predatory
and
destroying
foreign
conquerors
the
ethiopians
whose
rulers
were
the
descendants
of
the
who
retired
to
napata
on
the
succession
of
the
powerful
bubastite
dynasty
of
shishak
to
that
of
tanis
abandoning
thebes
to
the
northerners
did
much
to
destroy
the
prestige
of
amen
and
of
everything
connected
with
him
an
ethiopian
victory
meant
only
an
assyrian
reconquest
and
between
them
ethiopians
and
assyrians
had
ruined
egypt
in
the
saïte
period
thebes
had
declined
greatly
in
power
as
well
as
in
influence
and
all
its
traditions
were
anathema
to
the
leading
people
of
the
time
although
not
of
course
in
sense
with
the
saïte
period
we
seem
almost
to
have
retraced
our
steps
and
to
have
reentered
the
age
of
the
pyramid
builders
all
the
pomp
and
glory
of
thothmes
amenhetep
and
ramses
were
gone
the
days
of
imperial
egypt
were
over
and
the
minds
of
men
sickened
of
foreign
war
turned
for
peace
and
quietness
to
the
simpler
ideals
of
the
ivth
and
vth
dynasties
we
have
already
seen
that
an
archaistic
revival
of
the
styles
of
the
early
dynasties
is
characteristic
of
this
late
period
and
that
men
were
buried
at
sakkâra
and
at
thebes
in
tombs
which
recall
in
form
and
decoration
those
of
the
courtiers
of
the
pyramid
builders
everywhere
we
see
this
fashion
of
archaism
a
theban
noble
of
this
period
named
aba
was
buried
at
thebes
long
ago
nearly
three
thousand
years
before
under
the
vith
dynasty
there
had
lived
a
great
noble
of
the
same
name
who
was
buried
in
a
at
dêr
in
middle
egypt
this
tomb
was
open
and
known
in
the
days
of
the
second
aba
who
caused
to
be
copied
and
reproduced
in
his
tomb
in
the
asasîf
at
thebes
most
of
the
scenes
from
the
with
which
it
had
been
decorated
the
tomb
of
the
vith
dynasty
aba
has
lately
been
copied
for
the
archaeological
survey
of
egypt
egypt
exploration
fund
by
de
garis
davies
who
has
found
the
reliefs
of
the
xxvith
dynasty
aba
of
considerable
use
to
him
in
reconstituting
destroyed
portions
of
their
ancient
originals
during
late
years
important
discoveries
of
objects
of
this
era
have
been
few
one
of
the
most
noteworthy
is
that
of
a
contemporary
inscription
describing
the
battle
of
momemphis
which
is
mentioned
by
herodotus
ii
we
now
have
the
official
account
of
this
battle
and
know
that
it
took
place
in
the
third
year
of
the
reign
of
amasis
not
before
he
became
king
this
was
the
fight
in
which
the
unpatriotic
king
apries
who
had
paid
for
his
partiality
for
the
greeks
of
with
the
loss
of
his
throne
was
finally
defeated
as
we
see
from
this
inscription
he
was
probably
murdered
by
the
country
people
during
his
flight
the
following
are
the
most
important
passages
of
the
inscription
majesty
amasis
was
in
the
discussing
plans
for
his
whole
land
when
one
came
to
say
unto
him
apries
is
rowing
up
he
hath
gone
on
board
the
ships
which
have
crossed
over
haunebu
greeks
one
knows
not
their
number
are
traversing
the
which
is
as
if
it
had
no
master
to
rule
it
he
apries
hath
summoned
them
they
are
coming
round
him
it
is
he
who
hath
arranged
their
settlement
in
the
the
name
they
infest
the
whole
breadth
of
egypt
those
who
are
on
thy
waters
fly
before
them
his
majesty
mounted
his
chariot
having
taken
lance
and
bow
in
his
hand
the
enemy
reached
andropolis
the
soldiers
sang
with
joy
on
the
roads
they
did
their
duty
in
destroying
the
enemy
his
majesty
fought
like
a
lion
he
made
victims
among
them
one
knows
not
how
many
the
ships
and
their
warriors
were
overturned
they
saw
the
depths
as
do
the
fishes
like
a
flame
he
extended
making
a
feast
of
fighting
his
heart
rejoiced
the
third
year
the
athyr
one
came
to
tell
majesty
their
be
ended
they
throng
the
roads
there
are
thousands
there
ravaging
the
land
they
fill
every
road
those
who
are
in
ships
bear
thy
terror
in
their
hearts
but
it
is
not
yet
said
his
majesty
unto
his
soldiers
young
men
and
old
men
do
this
in
the
cities
and
nomes
going
upon
every
road
let
not
a
day
pass
without
fighting
their
galleys
the
land
was
traversed
as
by
the
blast
of
a
tempest
destroying
their
ships
which
were
abandoned
by
the
crews
the
people
accomplished
their
fate
killing
the
prince
apries
on
his
couch
when
he
had
gone
to
repose
in
his
cabin
when
he
saw
his
friend
overthrown
his
majesty
himself
buried
him
apries
in
order
to
establish
him
as
a
king
possessing
virtue
for
his
majesty
decreed
that
the
hatred
of
the
gods
should
be
removed
from
this
is
the
event
to
which
we
have
already
referred
in
a
preceding
chapter
as
proving
the
great
amelioration
of
egyptian
ideas
with
regard
to
the
treatment
of
a
conquered
enemy
as
compared
with
those
of
other
ancient
nations
amasis
refers
to
the
deposed
monarch
as
his
and
buries
him
in
a
manner
befitting
a
king
at
the
charges
of
amasis
himself
this
act
warded
off
from
the
spirit
of
apries
the
just
anger
of
the
gods
at
his
partiality
for
the
devils
and
ensured
his
reception
by
osiris
as
a
king
neb
menkh
the
town
of
naukratis
where
apries
established
himself
had
been
granted
to
the
greek
traders
by
psametik
i
a
century
or
more
before
recent
exploration
of
the
site
has
led
to
a
considerable
modification
of
our
first
ideas
of
the
place
which
were
obtained
from
petrie
excavations
petrie
was
the
discoverer
of
naukratis
and
his
diggings
told
us
what
naukratis
was
like
in
the
first
instance
but
hogarth
has
shown
that
several
of
his
identifications
were
erroneous
and
that
the
map
of
the
place
must
be
redrawn
the
chief
error
was
in
the
placing
of
the
hellenion
the
great
of
the
greeks
which
is
now
known
to
be
in
quite
a
different
position
from
that
assigned
to
it
by
petrie
the
of
petrie
has
now
been
shown
to
be
hogarth
has
also
pointed
out
that
an
old
egyptian
town
existed
at
long
before
the
greeks
came
there
this
town
is
mentioned
on
a
very
interesting
stele
of
black
basalt
discovered
at
tell
gaif
the
site
of
naukratis
and
now
in
the
cairo
museum
under
the
name
of
which
is
called
the
first
is
the
old
egyptian
name
the
second
the
greek
name
adapted
to
egyptian
hieroglyphs
the
stele
was
erected
by
tekhtnebf
the
last
native
king
of
egypt
to
commemorate
his
gifts
to
the
temples
of
neïth
on
the
occasion
of
his
accession
at
sais
it
is
beautifully
cut
and
the
inscription
is
written
in
a
curious
manner
with
alphabetic
spellings
instead
of
ideographs
and
ideographs
instead
of
alphabetic
spellings
which
savours
fully
of
the
affectation
of
the
learned
pedant
who
drafted
it
for
now
of
course
in
the
fourth
century
before
christ
nobody
but
a
priestly
antiquarian
could
read
hieroglyphics
demotic
was
the
only
writing
for
practical
purposes
we
see
this
fact
well
illustrated
in
the
inscriptions
of
the
ptolemaïc
temples
the
accession
of
the
ptolemies
marked
a
great
increase
in
the
material
wealth
of
egypt
and
foreign
conquest
again
came
in
fashion
ptolemy
euergetes
marched
into
asia
in
the
grand
style
of
a
ramses
and
brought
back
the
images
of
gods
which
had
been
carried
off
by
esarhaddon
or
nebuchadnezzar
ii
centuries
before
he
was
received
on
his
return
to
egypt
with
acclamations
as
a
true
successor
of
the
pharaohs
the
imperial
spirit
was
again
in
vogue
and
the
archaistic
simplicity
and
independence
of
the
saïtes
gave
place
to
an
archaistic
imperialism
the
of
which
were
the
repair
and
building
of
temples
in
the
great
pharaonic
style
on
these
we
see
the
ptolemies
masquerading
as
pharaohs
and
the
climax
of
absurdity
is
reached
when
ptolemy
auletes
the
piper
is
seen
striking
down
asiatic
enemies
in
the
manner
of
or
ramses
this
scene
is
directly
copied
from
a
ramesside
temple
and
we
find
imitations
of
reliefs
of
ramses
ii
so
slavish
that
the
name
of
the
earlier
king
is
actually
copied
as
well
as
the
relief
and
appears
above
the
figure
of
a
ptolemy
the
names
of
the
nations
who
were
conquered
by
thothmes
iii
are
repeated
on
ptolemaic
sculptures
to
do
duty
for
the
conquered
of
euergetes
with
all
sorts
of
mistakes
in
spelling
naturally
and
also
with
later
interpolations
such
an
inscription
is
that
in
the
temple
of
kom
ombo
which
say
ce
has
held
to
contain
the
names
of
and
and
to
prove
the
knowledge
of
the
latter
name
in
the
fourteenth
century
before
christ
the
name
of
caphtor
is
the
old
egyptian
keftiu
crete
that
of
casluhim
is
unknown
in
real
old
egyptian
inscriptions
and
in
this
ptolemaic
list
at
kom
ombo
it
may
be
quite
a
late
interpolation
in
the
lists
perhaps
no
older
than
the
persian
period
since
we
find
the
names
of
parsa
persia
and
susa
which
were
certainly
unknown
to
thothmes
iii
included
in
it
we
see
generally
from
the
ptolemaic
inscriptions
that
nobody
could
read
them
but
a
few
priests
who
often
made
mistakes
one
of
the
most
serious
was
the
identification
of
keftiu
with
phoenicia
in
the
stele
of
canopus
this
misled
modern
archaeologists
down
to
the
time
of
discoveries
at
knossos
though
how
these
utterly
looking
keftiu
could
have
been
phoenicians
was
a
puzzle
to
everybody
we
now
know
of
course
that
they
were
mycenaean
or
minoan
cretans
and
that
the
ptolemaic
antiquaries
made
a
mistake
in
identifying
the
land
of
keftiu
with
phoenicia
we
must
not
however
say
too
much
in
dispraise
of
the
ptolemaic
egyptians
and
their
works
we
have
to
be
grateful
to
them
indeed
for
the
building
of
the
temples
of
edfu
and
dendera
which
owing
to
their
later
date
are
still
in
good
preservation
while
the
best
preserved
of
the
old
pharaonic
fanes
such
as
medinet
habû
have
suffered
considerably
from
the
ravages
of
time
eor
these
temples
show
us
what
an
old
egyptian
temple
when
perfect
really
looked
like
they
are
so
to
speak
perfect
mummies
of
temples
while
of
the
old
buildings
we
have
nothing
but
the
disjointed
and
damaged
skeletons
a
good
deal
of
repairing
has
been
done
to
these
buildings
especially
to
that
at
edfu
of
late
years
but
the
main
archaeological
interest
of
ptolemaic
and
roman
times
has
been
found
in
the
field
of
epigraphy
and
the
study
of
papyri
with
which
the
names
of
kenyon
grenfell
and
hunt
are
chiefly
connected
the
treasures
which
have
lately
been
obtained
by
the
british
museum
in
the
shape
of
the
manuscripts
of
of
athens
the
lost
poems
of
bacchylides
and
the
mimes
of
herondas
all
of
which
have
been
published
for
the
trustees
of
that
institution
by
kenyon
are
known
to
those
who
are
interested
in
these
subjects
the
long
series
of
publications
of
grenfell
and
hunt
issued
at
the
expense
of
the
egypt
exploration
fund
branch
with
the
exception
of
the
volume
of
discoveries
at
which
was
issued
by
the
university
of
california
is
also
well
known
the
two
places
with
which
grenfell
and
work
has
been
chiefly
connected
are
the
fayyûm
and
behnesâ
the
site
of
the
ancient
permje
or
the
of
the
fayyûm
which
attained
such
prominence
in
the
days
of
the
xiith
dynasty
seems
to
have
had
little
or
no
history
during
the
whole
period
of
the
new
empire
but
in
ptolemaic
times
it
revived
and
again
became
one
of
the
richest
and
most
important
provinces
of
egypt
the
town
of
arsinoë
was
founded
at
crocodilopolis
where
are
now
the
mounds
of
kom
the
mound
of
the
horseman
near
medinet
and
became
the
capital
of
the
province
at
illahûn
just
outside
the
entrance
to
the
fayyûm
was
the
great
nile
harbour
and
entrepôt
of
the
called
ptolemaïs
hormos
the
explorations
of
hogarth
grenfell
and
hunt
in
the
years
of
and
resulted
in
the
identification
of
the
sites
of
the
ancient
cities
of
karanis
kom
ushîm
bacchias
omm
euhemeria
kasr
theadelphia
harît
and
philoteris
wadfa
the
work
for
the
university
of
california
in
at
umm
showed
that
this
place
was
tebtunis
dime
on
the
northern
coast
of
the
birket
karûn
the
modern
representative
of
the
ancient
lake
moeris
is
now
known
to
be
the
ancient
nesos
the
isle
of
soknopaios
a
local
form
of
sebek
the
of
the
fayyûm
at
karanis
this
god
was
worshipped
under
the
name
of
petesuchos
whom
sebek
has
in
conjunction
with
osiris
pnepherôs
beautiful
of
at
tebtunis
he
became
sebek
lord
of
tebtunis
this
is
a
typical
example
of
the
portmanteau
pronunciations
of
the
egyptians
many
very
interesting
discoveries
were
made
during
the
course
of
the
excavations
of
these
places
besides
find
of
the
temple
of
petesuchos
and
pnepherôs
at
karanis
consisting
of
roman
pottery
of
varied
form
and
roman
agricultural
implements
including
a
perfect
plough
the
main
interest
of
all
however
lies
both
here
and
at
behnesâ
in
the
papyri
they
consist
of
greek
and
latin
documents
of
all
ages
from
the
early
ptolemaic
to
the
christian
in
fact
grenfell
and
hunt
have
been
unearthing
and
sifting
the
contents
of
the
baskets
of
the
ancient
ptolemaic
and
roman
egyptians
which
had
been
thrown
out
on
to
near
the
towns
nothing
perishes
in
the
dry
climate
and
soil
of
egypt
so
the
contents
of
the
ancient
have
been
preserved
intact
until
our
own
day
and
have
been
found
by
grenfell
and
hunt
just
as
the
contents
of
the
houses
of
the
ancient
indian
rulers
of
chinese
turkestan
at
niya
and
khotan
with
their
store
of
documents
have
been
preserved
intact
in
the
dry
tibetan
desert
climate
and
have
been
found
by
dr
stein
there
is
much
analogy
between
the
discoveries
of
grenfell
and
hunt
in
egypt
and
those
of
stein
in
turkestan
illustrated
on
plate
ix
of
fayûm
towns
and
their
papyri
see
ruins
of
khotan
london
the
documents
are
of
all
kinds
consisting
of
letters
lists
deeds
notices
receipts
accounts
and
business
records
of
every
sort
and
kind
besides
new
fragments
of
classical
authors
and
the
important
of
jesus
discovered
at
behnesâ
which
have
been
published
in
a
special
popular
form
by
the
egypt
exploration
fund
aoyla
and
new
sayings
of
jesus
these
last
fragments
of
the
oldest
christian
literature
which
are
of
such
great
importance
and
interest
to
all
christians
can
not
be
described
or
discussed
here
the
other
documents
are
no
less
important
to
the
student
of
ancient
literature
the
historian
and
the
sociologist
the
classical
fragments
include
many
texts
of
lost
authors
including
menander
we
will
give
a
few
specimens
of
the
private
letters
and
documents
which
will
show
how
extremely
modern
the
ancient
egyptians
were
and
how
little
difference
there
actually
is
between
our
civilization
and
theirs
except
in
of
mechanical
invention
they
had
no
locomotives
and
telephones
otherwise
they
were
the
same
we
resemble
them
much
more
than
we
resemble
our
mediaeval
ancestors
or
even
the
elizabethans
this

the

delightfully
like
the

the

eminently
characteristic

we

now
reached
in
our
survey
the
temple
building
of
the
ptolemies
was
carried
on
with
like
energy
one
of
the
temples
of
the
roman
period
is
that
at
philse
which
is
known
as
the
or
owing
to
the
great
picturesqueness
of
its
situation
this
small
temple
which
was
built
in
the
reign
of
trajan
has
been
a
favourite
subject
for
the
painters
of
the
last
fifty
years
and
next
to
the
pyramids
the
sphinx
and
karnak
it
is
probably
the
most
widely
known
of
all
egyptian
buildings
recently
it
has
come
very
much
to
the
front
for
an
additional
reason
like
all
the
other
temples
of
philse
it
had
been
archæologically
surveyed
and
cleared
by
gr
lyons
and
borchardt
but
further
work
of
a
character
was
rendered
necessary
by
the
building
of
the
great
aswan
dam
below
the
island
of
philse
one
of
the
results
of
which
has
been
the
partial
submergence
of
the
island
and
its
temples
including
the
picturesque
kiosk
the
following
account
taken
from
the
new
edition
of
to
egypt
and
the
will
suffice
better
than
any
other
description
to
explain
what
the
dam
is
how
it
has
affected
philse
and
what
work
has
been
done
to
obviate
the
possibility
of
serious
damage
to
the
kiosk
and
other
buildings
the
egyptian
government
signed
a
contract
with
john
aird
for
the
construction
of
the
great
reservoir
and
dam
at
shellâl
which
serves
for
the
storage
of

at
the
time
of
the

the

here
feet
above
its
old
normal
level
a
great
masonry
dyke
feet
high
in
places
has
been
carried
across
the
bab
of
the
first
cataract
and
a
canal
and
four
locks

hundred

long
and

the

long
and
over
ninety
feet
thick
at
the
base
in
places
it
rises
one
hundred
feet
above
the
bed
of
the
river
it
is
built
of
the
local
red
granite
and
at
each

the

is
built
into
the
granite

seven
hundred
and
eight
thousand
cubic
yards
of
masonry
were
used
the
sluices
are
in
number
and
are
arranged
at
four
different
levels
the
sight
of
the
great
volume
of
water
pouring
through
them
is
a
very
fine
one
the
nile
begins
to
rise
in

and
at
the
end
of
november
it
is
necessary
to
begin
closing
the
to
hold
up
the
water
by
the
end
of

the
reservoir
is

filled

submerged

can
sail

by
the
beginning
of
july
the
water
has
been
distributed
and
it
then
falls
to
its
normal
level
is
of
course
regrettable
that
the
engineers
were
unable
to
find
another
site
for
the
dam
as
it
seemed
inevitable
that
some
damage
would
result
to
the
temples
of
philæ
from
their
partial
submergence
korosko
was
proposed
as
a
site
but
was
rejected
for
cogent
reasons
and
apparently
shellâl
was
the
only
possible
place
further
no
serious
person
who
places
the
greatest
good
of
the
greatest
number
above
considerations
of
the
picturesque
and
the
will
deny
that
if
it
is
necessary
to
sacrifice
philæ
to
the
good
of
the
people
of
egypt
philæ
must
go
the
dead
bury
their
the
concern
of
the
rulers
of
egypt
must
be
with
the
living
people
of
egypt
rather
than
with
the
dead
bones
of
the
past
and
they
would
not
be
doing
their
duty
did
they
for
a
moment
allow
artistic
and
archaeological
considerations
to
outweigh
in
their
minds
the
practical
necessities
of
the
country
this
does
not
in
the
least
imply
that
they
do
not
owe
a
lesser
duty
to
the
monuments
of
egypt
which
are
among
the
most
precious
relics
of
the
past
history
of
mankind
they
do
owe
this
lesser
duty
and
with
regard
to
philae
it
has
been
conscientiously
fulfilled
the
whole
temple
in
order
that
its
stability
may
be
preserved
under
the
stress
of
submersion
has
been
braced
up
and
underpinned
under
the
superintendence
of
ball
of
the
survey
department
who
has
most
efficiently
carried
out
this
important

and
the

have
been
firmly
underpinned
in

and
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
actual
stability
of
philae
is
now
more
certain
than
that
of
any
other
temple
in
egypt
the
only
possible
damage
that
can
accrue
to
it
is
the
partial
discolouration
of
the
lower
courses
of
the
stonework
of
bed
which
already
bear
a
distinct
mark
some
surface
disintegration
from
the
formation
of
salt
crystals
is
perhaps
inevitable
here
but
the
effects
of
this
can
always
be
neutralized
by
careful
washing

it
should
be
an
important
charge
of
the

characteristic
of

on
the
island
of

opposite

an
interesting
discovery
has
lately
been
made
by
howard
carter
this
is
a
remarkable
well
which
was
supposed
by
the
ancients
to
lie
immediately
on

it
formed
the

of
calculations
of
the
measurement
of

important
finds
of
documents
written
in
aramaic
have
also
been
made
here
they
show
that
there
was
on
the
island
in
ptolemaic
times
a
regular
colony
of
syrian
merchants
south
of
aswan

the
nubian
language
which
is
quite
different
from

is
spoken
by
everybody
on

and
its
various
dialects
are
used
as
far
south
as
dongola
where
arabic
again
is
generally
spoken
till
we
reach
the
land
of
the

south
of

in

and
roman
days
the
nubians
were
a
powerful
people
and
the
whole
of
nubia
and
the
modern
north
sudan
formed
an
independent
kingdom
ruled
by
queens
who
bore
the
title
or
name
of
candace
it
was
the
eunuch
of
a
candace
who
was
converted
to
christianity
as
he
was
returning
from
a
mission
to
jerusalem
to
salute
jehovah
and
join
thyself
unto
his
was
the
command
to
philip
and
when
the
ethiopian
had
heard
the
gospel
from
his
lips
he
went
on
his
way

the
capital
of
this
candace

the
great
buildings
of

style
for
the
civilization
of

the

in

was
a
sort
of
appanage
of

when

were
originally
investigated
by

afterwards
by

during
the
last
few
years
they
and
the
pyramids
excavated
by
of
the
british
museum
for

government
have
been
again
explored
as
the
results
of
his
work
are
not
yet
fully
published
it
is
possible
at

only
to
quote
the
following
description
from
for
egypt
and
the
by
budge
of
work
on
the
pyramids
of
jebel
barkal
writer
excavated
the
shafts
of
one
of
the
pyramids
here
in
and
at
the
depth
of
about
cubits
found
a
group
of
three
chambers
in
one
of
which
were
a
number
of
bones
of
the
sheep
which
was
sacrificed
there
about
two
thousand
years
ago
and
also
portions
of
a
broken
amphora
which
had
held
wine
a
second
shaft
which
led
to
the
was
partly
emptied
but
at
a
further
depth
of
twenty
cubits
water
was
found
the
mark
of
the
reservoir
when
full
is
and
as
there
were
no
visible
means
for
pumping
it
out
the
could
not
be
with
regard
to
the
bagarawîya
pyramids
budge
writes
on
of
the
same
work
à
propos
of
the
story
of
the
italian
ferlini
that
he
found
roman
jewelry
in
one
of
these
pyramids
the
writer
excavated
a
number
of
the
pyramids
of
meroë
for
the
of
the
sudan
sir
wingate
and
he
is
convinced
that
the
statements
made
by
ferlini
are
the
result
of
misapprehension
on
his
part
the
pyramids
are
solid
throughout
and
the
bodies
are
buried
under
them
when
the
details
are
complete
the
proofs
for
this
will
be
budge
has
also
written
upon
the
subject
of
the
orientation
of
the
jebel
barkal
and
nure
pyramids
illustration
the
isle
of
konosso
with
its
inscriptions
it
is
very
curious
to
find
the
pyramids
reappearing
in
egyptian
in
the
very
latest
period
of
egyptian
history
we
find
them
when
egyptian
civilization
was
just
entering
upon
its
vigorous
manhood
then
they
gradually
disappear
only
to
revive
in
its
decadent
and
exiled
old
age
the
ethiopian
pyramids
are
all
of
much
more
elongated
form
than
the
old
egyptian
ones
it
is
possible
that
they
may
be
a
survival
of
the
archaistic
movement
of
the
xxvith
dynasty
to
which
we
have
already
referred
these
are
not
the
latest
egyptian
monuments
in
the
sudan
nor
are
the
temples
of
naga
and
mesawwarat
the
most
ancient
though
they
belong
to
the
roman
period
and
are
decidedly
barbarian
as
to
their
style
and
especially
as
to
their
decoration
the
southernmost
as
well
as
latest
relic
of
egypt
in
the
sudan
is
the
christian
church
of
soba
on
the
blue
mie
a
few
miles
above
khartum
in
it
was
found
a
stone
ram
an
emblem
of
which
had
formerly
stood
in
the
temple
of
naga
and
had
been
brought
to
soba
perhaps
under
the
impression
that
it
was
the
christian
lamb
it
was
removed
to
the
garden
of
the
palace
at
khartum
where
it
now
stands
the
church
at
soba
is
a
relic
of
the
christian
kingdom
of
alua
which
succeeded
the
realm
of
the
candaces
one
of
its
chief
seats
was
at
dongola
and
all
nubia
is
covered
with
the
ruins
of
its
churches
it
was
of
course
an
offshoot
of
the
christianity
of
egypt
but
a
late
one
since
isis
was
still
worshipped
at
philse
in
the
sixth
century
long
after
the
edict
of
theodosius
had
officially
abolished
paganism
throughout
the
roman
world
and
the
nubians
were
at
first
zealous
votaries
of
the
goddess
of
philo
so
also
when
egypt
fell
beneath
the
sway
of
the
moslem
in
the
seventh
century
nubia
remained
an
independent
christian
state
and
continued
so
down
to
the
twelfth
century
when
the
soldiers
of
islam
conquered
the
country
of
late
pagan
and
early
christian
egypt
very
much
that
is
new
has
been
discovered
during
the
last
few
years
the
period
of
the
lower
empire
has
yielded
much
to
the
explorers
of
oxyrrhynchus
and
many
papyri
of
interest
belonging
to
this
period
have
been
published
by
kenyon
in
his
of
the
greek
papyri
in
the
british
especially
the
letters
of
flavius
abinæus
a
military
officer
of
the
fourth
century
the
papyri
of
this
period
are
full
of
the
titles
and
affected
phraseology
which
was
so
beloved
of
byzantine
scribes
dukes
of
the
thebaïd
magnificent
counts
and
lieutenants
secretaries
and
the
like
strut
across
the
pages
of
the
letters
and
documents
which
begin
the
name
of
our
lord
and
master
jesus
christ
the
god
and
saviour
of
us
all
in
the
year
x
of
the
reign
of
the
most
divine
and
praised
great
and
beneficent
lord
flavius
heraclius
or
other
the
eternal
augustus
and
month
x
year
x
of
the
in
it
is
an
extraordinary
period
this
of
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
which
we
have
now
entered
with
its
bizarre
combination
of
the
official
titulary
of
the
divine
and
eternal
cæsars
imperatores
augusti
with
the
initial
invocation
of
christ
and
the
trinity
it
is
the
transition
from
the
ancient
to
the
modern
world
and
as
such
has
an
interest
all
its
own
in
egypt
the
struggle
between
the
adherents
of
chalcedon
the
or
imperialists
of
the
orthodox
greek
rite
and
the
eutychians
or
the
followers
of
the
patriarch
dioskoros
who
rejected
chalcedon
was
going
on
with
unabated
fury
and
was
hardly
stopped
even
by
the
invasion
of
the
pagan
persians
the
last
effort
of
the
party
of
constantinople
to
stamp
out
the
monophysite
heresy
was
made
when
cyril
was
patriarch
and
governor
of
egypt
according
to
an
ingenious
theory
put
forward
by
butler
in
his
conquest
of
it
is
cyril
the
patriarch
who
was
the
mysterious
mukaukas
the
greek
word
or
and
magnificent
one
who
played
so
doubtful
a
part
in
the
events
of
the
arab
conquest
by
amr
in
usually
this
mukaukas
has
been
regarded
as
a
copt
and
the
copts
have
generally
been
credited
with
having
assisted
the
islamites
against
the
power
of
constantinople
this
was
a
very
natural
and
probable
conclusion
but
butler
will
have
it
that
the
copts
resisted
the
arabs
valiantly
and
that
the
treacherous
mukaukas
was
none
other
than
the
constantinopolitan
patriarch
himself
in
the
papyri
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
gradual
increase
of
arab
names
after
the
conquest
more
especially
in
those
of
the
archduke
rainer
collection
from
the
fayyûm
which
was
so
near
the
new
capital
city
fustât
in
upper
egypt
the
change
was
not
noticeable
for
a
long
time
and
in
the
great
collection
of
coptic
inscriptions
on
slips
of
limestone
and
sherds
of
pottery
used
as
a
substitute
for
paper
or
parchment
found
in
the
ruins
of
the
coptic
monastery
established
on
the
temple
site
of
dêr
we
find
no
arab
names
these
documents
part
of
which
have
been
published
by
crum
for
the
egypt
exploration
fund
while
another
part
will
shortly
be
issued
for
the
trustees
of
the
british
museum
by
hall
date
to
the
seventh
and
eighth
centuries
their
contents
resemble
those
of
the
earlier
papyri
from
oxyrrhynchus
though
they
are
not
of
so
varied
a
nature
and
are
generally
written
by
persons
of
less
intelligence
the
monks
and
peasants
of
the
monasteries
and
villages
of
tjême
or
western
thebes
during
the
late
excavation
of
the
xith
dynasty
temple
of

more
of
these
were
found
which
will
be
published
for
the
egypt
exploration
fund
by
naville
and
hall
of
actual
buildings
of
the
coptic
period
the
most
important
excavations
have
been
those
of
the
french
school
of
cairo
at
bâwît
north
of
asyût
this
work
which
was
carried
on
by
jean
clédat
has
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
very
important
frescoes
and
funerary
inscriptions
belonging
to
the
monastery
of
a
famous
martyr
apollo
with
these
new
discoveries
of
christian
egypt
our
work
reaches
its
fitting
close
the
frontier
which
divides
the
ancient
from
the
modern
world
has
almost
been
crossed
we
look
back
from
the
monastery
of
bâwît
down
a
long
vista
of
new
discoveries
until
four
thousand
years
before
we
see
again
the
great
heads
coming
to
the
tomb
of
den
narmer
inspecting
the
bodies
of
the
dead
northerners
