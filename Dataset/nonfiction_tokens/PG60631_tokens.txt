preface
to
new
edition
from
some
of
the
criticisms
on
the
first
edition
of
this
work
i
fear
that
the
distinction
i
endeavoured
to
draw
between
the
use
of
the
term
in
the
inorganic
and
in
the
spiritual
worlds
has
not
been
made
sufficiently
clear
i
stated
in
the
introduction
while
the
principle
of
polarity
pervades
both
worlds
i
am
far
from
assuming
that
the
laws
under
which
it
acts
are
identical
and
that
virtue
and
vice
pain
and
pleasure
are
products
of
the
same
mathematical
laws
as
regulate
the
attractions
and
repulsions
of
molecules
and
but
this
warning
has
been
apparently
overlooked
by
some
readers
who
have
assumed
that
instead
of
analogy
i
meant
identity
and
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
use
the
same
word
for
phenomena
so
essentially
distinct
as
those
of
the
material
and
the
spiritual
worlds
thus
my
philosopher
and
friend
professor
huxley
for
whose
authority
i
have
the
highest
respect
observed
in
a
recent
article
that
he
had
long
ago
acquired
a
habit
if
he
came
across
the
word
polarity
applied
to
anything
but
magnetism
and
electricity
of
throwing
down
the
book
and
reading
no
farther
i
must
confess
that
i
felt
a
little
disconcerted
when
i
read
this
passage
but
i
was
soon
consoled
for
in
a
month
or
two
afterwards
i
came
across
another
passage
in
the
same
review
which
said
revolting
may
be
the
accumulation
of
misery
at
the
negative
pole
of
society
in
contrast
with
that
of
monstrous
wealth
at
the
positive
pole
this
state
of
things
must
abide
and
grow
continuously
worse
as
long
as
istar
the
dual
goddess
of
the
babylonians
holds
her
way
surely
i
thought
here
is
a
case
in
which
the
professor
must
have
thrown
down
the
review
when
he
came
to
these
words
but
when
i
came
to
the
end
i
found
that
it
was
not
the
review
but
the
pen
which
must
have
been
thrown
down
for
the
article
is
signed
can
there
be
a
more
conclusive
proof
that
there
are
a
vast
variety
of
facts
outside
of
magnetism
and
electricity
connected
by
an
underlying
idea
which
inevitably
suggests
analogy
to
them
and
which
can
be
most
conveniently
expressed
by
the
word
words
after
all
are
only
coins
to
facilitate
the
interchange
of
ideas
and
the
best
word
is
that
which
serves
the
purpose
most
clearly
and
concisely
thus
instead
of
using
a
waggon
load
of
copper
or
the
verbiage
of
a
deed
to
express
the
ideas
comprised
in
such
words
as
or
we
coin
them
for
general
use
as
huxley
did
the
word
in
order
to
convey
our
meaning
polarity
is
such
a
word
it
sums
up
what
emerson
says
in
his
essay
on
compensation
or
action
and
reaction
we
meet
in
every
part
of
nature
in
darkness
and
light
in
the
ebb
and
flow
of
waters
in
male
and
female
in
the
inspiration
and
expiration
of
plants
and
animals
in
the
undulations
of
fluids
and
of
sound
in
the
centripetal
and
centrifugal
gravity
in
electricity
galvanism
and
chemical
affinity
superinduce
magnetism
at
one
end
of
a
needle
the
opposite
magnetism
takes
place
at
the
other
end
if
the
south
attracts
the
north
repels
an
inevitable
dualism
besets
nature
so
that
each
thing
is
a
half
and
suggests
another
to
make
it
whole
as
spirit
matter
man
woman
odd
even
subjective
objective
in
out
upper
under
motion
rest
yea
these
by
whatever
name
we
like
to
call
them
are
facts
and
not
fancies
and
facts
which
enter
largely
into
all
questions
whether
of
science
philosophy
religion
or
practical
policy
every
one
who
wishes
to
keep
at
all
abreast
with
modern
culture
ought
to
have
some
general
knowledge
of
the
ideas
and
principles
which
underlie
them
and
which
are
embraced
in
the
comprehensive
word
my
object
in
this
book
has
been
to
assist
the
reader
who
is
not
a
specialist
in
arriving
at
some
general
understanding
of
the
subjects
treated
of
and
i
may
hope
in
awakening
such
an
interest
in
them
as
may
induce
him
to
prosecute
further
researches
if
i
succeed
in
this
my
object
will
have
been
attained
preface
the
reception
given
to
my
former
work
on
science
and
modern
thought
has
induced
me
to
write
this
further
one
i
refer
not
so
much
to
the
reviews
of
professional
critics
though
as
a
rule
nothing
could
be
more
courteous
and
candid
but
rather
to
the
letters
i
have
received
from
readers
of
various
age
sex
and
condition
saying
that
i
had
assisted
them
in
understanding
much
interesting
matter
which
had
previously
been
a
sealed
book
to
them
if
i
am
good
for
anything
it
is
for
a
certain
faculty
of
lucid
condensation
and
i
have
thought
that
i
might
apply
this
to
some
of
the
branches
of
modern
science
such
as
the
new
chemistry
and
physiology
as
well
as
in
my
first
work
to
the
more
familiar
subjects
of
astronomy
and
geology
while
at
the
same
time
i
might
extend
it
to
some
of
the
more
obvious
problems
of
religion
morals
metaphysics
and
practical
life
which
force
themselves
more
and
more
every
day
on
the
attention
of
intelligent
thinkers
as
in
the
former
work
the
scientific
speculations
were
linked
together
by
the
leading
idea
of
the
universality
of
law
so
in
this
unity
is
given
to
them
by
the
principle
of
polarity
which
manifests
itself
everywhere
as
the
fundamental
condition
of
the
material
and
spiritual
universe
for
the
scientific
portion
of
the
work
i
am
indebted
to
the
most
approved
authorities
such
as
darwin
huxley
haeckel
and
professor
volume
on
the
new
chemistry
in
the
international
scientific
series
for
the
religious
and
philosophical
speculations
i
am
myself
responsible
for
although
i
have
derived
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
and
profit
from
herbert
writings
i
had
arrived
at
my
principal
conclusions
independently
before
i
had
read
any
of
his
works
i
can
only
hope
that
i
may
have
succeeded
in
presenting
a
good
many
abstruse
questions
in
a
popular
form
intelligible
to
the
average
mind
of
ordinary
readers
and
calculated
if
it
teaches
nothing
else
to
teach
them
a
practical
philosophy
which
inculcates
tolerance
and
charity
and
assists
them
in
finding
sermons

stones

good

scatter
a
heap
of
iron
filings
on
a
plate
of
glass
bring
near
it
a
magnet
and
tap
the
glass
gently
and
you
will
see
the
filings
arrange
themselves
in
regular
forms
if
one
pole
only
of
the
magnet
is
brought
near
the
glass
the
filings
arrange
themselves
in
lines
radiating
from
that
pole
next
lay
the
on
the
glass
so
that
the
filings
are
influenced
by
both
poles
they
will
arrange
themselves
into
a
series
of
regular
curves
in
other
words
the
chaos
of
a
confused
heap
of
inert
matter
has
become
a
cosmos
of
harmonious
arrangement
assuming
definite
form
in
obedience
to
law
as
the
old
saying
has
it
that
road
leads
to
rome
so
this
simple
experiment
leads
up
to
a
principle
which
underlies
all
existence
knowable
to
human
of
polarity
why
do
the
iron
filings
arrange
themselves
in
regular
curves
because
they
are
magnetised
by
the
influence
of
the
larger
magnet
and
each
little
particle
of
iron
is
converted
into
a
little
magnet
with
two
opposite
poles
attracting
and
repelling
illustration
what
is
a
magnet
it
is
a
special
manifestation
of
the
more
general
principle
of
polarity
by
which
energy
when
it
passes
from
the
passive
or
neutralised
into
the
active
state
does
so
under
the
condition
of
developing
opposite
and
conflicting
energies
no
action
without
reaction
no
positive
without
a
negative
and
as
we
see
it
in
the
simplest
form
in
our
magnets
no
north
pole
without
a
south
ever
repelling
like
and
attracting
unlike
the
magnet
again
may
be
considered
as
a
special
form
of
electricity
for
if
we
send
an
electric
current
through
a
coil
of
copper
wire
encircling
a
bar
of
soft
iron
the
bar
is
at
once
converted
into
a
magnet
so
that
a
magnet
may
be
considered
as
the
summing
up
at
two
opposite
extremities
or
poles
of
the
attractive
and
repulsive
effects
of
electric
currents
circulating
round
it
but
this
electricity
is
itself
subject
to
the
law
of
polarity
whether
developed
by
chemical
action
in
the
form
of
a
current
or
electricity
in
motion
or
by
friction
in
the
form
of
statical
electricity
of
small
quantity
but
high
tension
in
all
cases
a
positive
implies
a
negative
in
all
like
repels
like
and
attracts
unlike
conversely
as
polarity
produces
definite
structure
so
definite
structure
everywhere
implies
polarity
the
same
principle
prevails
not
only
throughout
the
inorganic
or
world
of
matter
but
throughout
the
organic
or
world
of
life
and
specially
throughout
its
highest
manifestations
in
human
life
and
character
and
in
the
highest
products
of
its
evolution
in
societies
religions
and
philosophies
to
show
this
by
some
familiar
and
striking
examples
is
the
main
object
of
this
book
but
here
let
me
interpose
a
word
of
caution
i
must
avoid
the
error
which
vitiates
professor
interesting
work
on
law
in
the
spiritual
world
of
confounding
analogy
and
identity
because
the
principle
of
polarity
pervades
alike
the
natural
and
spiritual
worlds
i
am
far
from
assuming
that
the
laws
under
which
it
acts
are
identical
and
that
virtue
and
vice
pain
and
pleasure
ugliness
and
beauty
are
products
of
the
same
mathematical
changes
of
sign
and
inverse
squares
or
cubes
of
distances
as
regulate
the
attractions
and
repulsions
of
molecules
and
atoms
all
i
say
is
that
the
same
pervading
principle
may
be
traced
wherever
human
thought
and
human
knowledge
extend
that
it
is
apparently
for
some
reason
unknown
to
us
the
essential
condition
of
all
existence
within
the
sphere
of
that
thought
and
that
knowledge
and
that
what
lies
beyond
it
is
the
great
unknown
behind
the
impenetrable
veil
which
it
is
not
given
to
mortals
to
uplift
in
like
manner
if
i
call
myself
modern
zoroastrian
it
is
not
that
i
wish
or
expect
to
teach
a
new
religion
or
revive
an
old
one
to
see
christian
churches
dedicated
to
ormuzd
or
right
reverend
bishops
exchanging
the
apron
and
for
the
mitre
and
flowing
robes
of
the
ancient
magi
but
simply
this
all
religions
i
take
to
be
hypotheses
by
which
successive
ages
and
races
of
men
try
to
satisfy
the
aspirations
and
harmonise
the
knowledge
which
in
the
course
of
evolution
have
come
to
be
for
the
time
their
spiritual
equipment
the
best
proof
of
any
religion
is
that
it
that
it
is
part
of
the
same
evolution
and
that
on
the
whole
it
works
well
is
in
tolerable
harmony
with
its
environment
when
that
environment
changes
when
loftier
views
of
morality
prevail
when
knowledge
is
increased
and
the
domain
of
science
everywhere
extends
its
frontier
religions
must
change
with
it
if
they
are
to
remain
good
working
and
not
become
unworkable
and
unbelievable
hypotheses
now
of
all
the
religious
hypotheses
which
remain
workable
in
the
present
state
of
human
knowledge
that
seems
to
me
the
best
which
frankly
recognises
the
existence
of
this
dual
law
or
law
of
polarity
as
the
fundamental
condition
of
the
universe
and
personifying
the
good
principle
under
the
name
of
ormuzd
and
the
evil
one
under
that
of
ahriman
looks
with
earnest
but
silent
and
unspoken
reverence
on
the
great
unknown
beyond
which
may
in
some
way
incomprehensible
to
mortals
reconcile
the
two
opposites
and
give
the
final
victory
to
the
good
oh
yet
we
hope
that
somehow
good
will
be
the
final
goal
of
ill
so
sings
the
poet
of
the
nineteenth
century
so
if
we
understand
his
doctrine
rightly
taught
the
bactrian
sage
zoroaster
some
forty
centuries
earlier
this
and
this
alone
seems
to
me
to
afford
a
working
hypothesis
which
is
based
on
fact
can
be
brought
into
harmony
with
the
existing
environment
and
embraces
in
a
wider
synthesis
all
that
is
good
in
other
philosophies
and
religions
when
i
talk
of
our
new
environment
it
requires
one
who
like
the
author
has
lived
more
than
the
scriptural
threescore
and
ten
years
and
has
so
to
speak
one
foot
on
the
past
and
one
on
the
present
to
realise
how
enormous
is
the
change
which
a
single
generation
has
made
in
the
whole
spiritual
surroundings
of
a
civilised
man
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
i
was
a
student
at
cambridge
little
more
than
fifty
years
ago
astronomy
was
the
only
branch
of
natural
science
which
could
be
said
to
be
definitely
brought
within
the
domain
of
natural
law
and
that
only
as
regards
the
law
of
gravity
and
the
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
for
little
or
nothing
was
known
as
to
their
constitution
geology
was
just
beginning
the
series
of
conquests
by
which
time
and
the
order
and
succession
of
life
on
the
earth
have
been
annexed
by
science
as
completely
as
space
by
astronomy
and
theories
of
cataclysms
universal
deluges
and
special
recent
creations
of
animals
and
man
still
held
their
ground
and
were
quoted
as
proofs
of
a
universe
maintained
by
constant
supernatural
interference
and
when
i
say
that
space
had
been
annexed
to
science
by
astronomy
it
was
really
only
that
half
of
space
which
extends
from
the
standpoint
of
the
human
senses
in
the
direction
of
the
infinitely

important
half

extends
downwards
to

small

unknown
or
the
subject
only
of
the
vaguest
conjectures
chemistry
was
to
a
great
extent
an
empirical
science
and
molecules
and
atoms
were
at
best
guesses
at
truth
or
rather
convenient
mathematical
abstractions
with
no
more
actual
reality
than
the
symbols
of
the
differential
calculus
the
real
causes
and
laws
of
heat
light
and
electricity
were
as
little
known
as
those
of
molecular
action
and
of
chemical
affinity
the
great
laws
of
the
indestructibility
of
matter
the
correlation
of
forces
and
the
conservation
of
energy
were
unknown
or
only
just
beginning
to
be
foreshadowed
as
regards
life
protoplasm
was
a
word
unheard
of
scientific
biology
zoology
and
botany
were
in
their
infancy
and
the
gradual
building
up
of
all
living
matter
from
a
speck
of
protoplasm
through
a
primitive
cell
was
not
even
suspected
above
all
the
works
of
darwin
had
not
been
published
and
evolution
had
not
become
the
general
law
of
modern
thought
nor
had
the
discovery
of
the
antiquity
of
man
and
of
his
slow
development
upwards
from
the
rudest
origins
shattered
into
fragments
established
beliefs
as
to
his
recent
miraculous
creation
science
and
miracle
have
been
fighting
out
their
battle
during
the
last
fifty
years
along
the
whole
line
and
science
has
been
at
every
point
victorious
miracle
in
the
sense
in
which
our
fathers
believed
in
it
has
been
not
only
repulsed
but
annihilated
so
completely
that
really
little
remains
but
to
bury
the
dead
the
result
of
these
discoveries
has
been
to
make
a
greater
change
in
the
spiritual
environment
of
a
single
generation
than
would
be
made
in
their
physical
environment
if
the
glacial
period
suddenly
returned
and
buried
northern
europe
under
polar
ice
the
change
is
certainly
greater
in
the
last
fifty
years
than
it
had
been
in
the
previous
five
hundred
and
in
many
respects
greater
than
in
the
previous
five
thousand
it
may
be
sufficient
to
glance
shortly
at
the
equally
great
corresponding
changes
which
this
period
has
witnessed
in
the
practical
conditions
of
life
and
of
society
if
astronomy
and
geology
have
extended
the
dominion
of
the
mind
over
space
and
time
steamers
railways
and
the
electric
telegraph
have
gained
the
mastery
over
them
for
practical
purposes
commerce
and
emigration
have
assumed
international
proportions
and
india
australia
and
america
are
nearer
to
us
and
connected
with
us
by
closer
ties
than
scotland
was
to
england
in
my
schoolboy
days
education
and
a
cheap
press
have
even
in
a
greater
degree
revolutionised
society
and
knowledge
reaching
the
masses
has
carried
with
it
power
so
that
democracy
and
are
whether
for
good
or
evil
everywhere
in
the
ascendant
and
old
privileges
and
traditions
are
everywhere
decaying
with
such
a
great
change
of
environment
it
is
evident
that
many
of
the
old
creeds
institutions
and
other
organisms
adapted
to
old
conditions
must
have
become
as
obsolete
as
a
jacket
would
be
as
the
comfortable
habiliment
of
a
man
but
as
a
lobster
which
has
cast
its
shell
does
not
feel
at
ease
until
it
has
grown
a
new
one
so
thinking
men
of
the
present
day
are
driven
to
devise
to
a
great
extent
each
for
themselves
some
larger
theory
which
may
serve
them
as
a
with
which
to
go
through
life
and
bring
the
ineradicable
aspirations
and
emotions
of
their
nature
into
some
tolerable
harmony
with
existing
facts
to
me
as
one
of
those
thinking
units
this
theory
of
what
for
want
of
a
better
name
i
call
has
approved
itself
as
a
good
working
theory
which
reconciles
more
intellectual
and
moral
difficulties
and
affords
a
better
guide
in
conduct
and
practical
life
than
any
other
and
in
a
word
enables
me
to
reduce
my
own
individual
chaos
into
some
sort
of
an
intelligible
and
ordered
cosmos
i
feel
moved
therefore
to
preach
through
the
press
my
little
sermon
upon
it
for
the
benefit
of
those
whom
it
may
concern
feeling
assured
that
the
process
of
evolution
by
which
the
old
order
changes
giving
place
to
new
can
best
be
assisted
by
the
honest
and
unbiassed
expression
of
the
results
of
individual
thought
and
experience
on
the
part
of
any
one
of
those
units
whose
aggregates
form
the
complicated
organisms
of
religions
and
philosophies
of

of

if
in

when

it
is
requisite
to
go
down
to

for

so
much
the
more
is
it
necessary
in
building
up
a
theory
to
begin
at
the
beginning
and
give
it
a
solid
groundwork
of
the
fallacies
current
in
the
world
arise
from
the
haste
with
which
people
rush
to
conclusions
on
insufficient
premises
take
for
instance
any
of
the
political
questions
of
the
day
such
as
the
irish
question
how
many
of
those
who
express
confident
opinions
and
get
angry
and
excited
on
one
side
or
the
other
could
answer
any
of
the
preliminary
questions
which
are
the
indispensable
conditions
of
any
rational
judgment
how
many
marks
would
they
get
for
an
examination
paper
which
asked
what
was
the
population
of
ireland
what
proportion
of
that
population
was
agricultural
what
proportion
of
that
agricultural
population
consisted
of
holders
of
small
tenements
what
was
the
scale
of
rents
compared
with
that
for
small
holdings
in
other
countries
how
much
of
that
rent
was
levied
on
them
for
their
own
improvements
and
other
similar
questions
which
lie
at
the
root
of
the
matter
in
how
many
cases
would
it
be
found
that
the
whole
superstructure
of
their
confident
and
passionate
theories
about
the
irish
difficulty
was
based
on
no
more
solid
foundation
than
their
like
or
dislike
of
a
particular
statesman
or
of
a
particular
party
i
propose
therefore
to
begin
at
the
beginning
and
taking
the
simplest
case
that
of
dead
or
inorganic
matter
show
how
the
material
universe
is
built
up
by
the
operation
of
the
law
of
polarity
what
does
matter
consist
of
of
molecules
and
molecules
are
made
up
of
atoms
and
these
are
held
together
or
parted
and
built
up
into
the
various
forms
of
the
material
universe
primarily
by
polar
forces
let
me
endeavour
to
make
this
intelligible
to
the
intelligent
but
unscientific
reader
suppose
the
pyramid
of
cheops
shown
for
the
first
time
to
a
giant
whose
eye
was
on
such
a
scale
that
he
could
just
discern
it
as
a
separate
object
he
might
make
all
sorts
of
ingenious
conjectures
as
to
its
nature
but
if
microscopes
had
been
invented
in
and
he
looked
through
one
he
would
find
that
it
was
built
up
layer
by
layer
on
a
regular
plan
and
in
determinate
lines
and
angles
by
molecules
or
what
seemed
to
him
almost
infinitely
small
masses
of
squared
stone
for
pyramid
write
crystal
and
we
may
see
by
the
human
sense
aided
by
human
instruments
and
human
reason
a
similar
structure
built
up
in
the
same
way
by
minute
particles
or
again
divide
and
subdivide
our
iron
filings
until
we
reach
the
limit
of
possible
mechanical
division
discernible
by
the
microscope
each
one
remains
essentially
a
bar
of
iron
as
capable
of
being
magnetised
and
showing
the
same
qualities
and
behaviour
under
chemical
tests
as
the
original
bar
of
iron
from
which
the
filings
were
taken
this
carries
us
a
long
way
down
towards
the
infinitely
small
for
mechanical
division
and
microscopic
visibility
can
be
carried
down
to
magnitudes
which
are
of
the
order
of
of
an
inch
but
this
is
only
the
first
step
to
understand
our
molecules
we
must
ascertain
whether
they
are
infinitely
divisible
and
whether
they
are
continuous
expanding
by
being
spread
out
thinner
and
thinner
like
skin
or
are
they
separate
bodies
with
intervals
between
them
like
little
planets
forming
one
solar
system
and
revolving
in
space
by
fixed
laws
ancient
science
guessed
at
the
former
solution
and
embodied
it
in
the
maxim
nature
abhors
a
modern
science
proves
the
latter
in
the
first
place
bodies
combine
only
in
fixed
proportions
which
is
a
necessary
consequence
if
they
consist
of
definite
indivisible
particles
but
inconceivable
if
the
substance
of
each
is
indefinitely
divisible
thus
water
is
formed
in
one
way
and
one
only
by
uniting
one
volume
or
molecule
of
oxygen
with
two
of
hydrogen
and
any
excess
of
one
or
the
other
is
left
out
and
remains
uncombined
but
if
the
molecules
could
be
divided
into
halves
quarters
and
so
on
indefinitely
there
can
be
no
reason
why
their
union
should
take
place
always
in
this
one
proportion
and
this
only
a
still
more
conclusive
proof
is
furnished
by
the
behaviour
of
substances
which
exist
in
the
form
of
gases
if
a
jar
is
filled
with
one
gas
a
second
and
third
gas
can
be
poured
into
it
as
readily
as
into
a
vacuum
the
result
being
that
the
pressure
on
the
sides
of
the
jar
is
exactly
equal
to
the
sum
of
the
separate
pressures
of
each
separate
gas
this
evidently
means
that
the
first
gas
does
not
occupy
the
whole
space
but
that
its
particles
are
like
a
battalion
of
soldiers
in
loose
skirmishing
order
with
such
intervals
between
each
unit
that
a
second
and
third
battalion
can
be
marched
in
and
placed
on
the
same
ground
without
disturbing
the
formation
and
with
the
result
only
of
increasing
the
intensity
of
the
fire
now
gas
is
matter
as
much
as
solids
or
liquids
and
in
the
familiar
instance
of
water
we
see
that
it
is
merely
a
question
of
more
or
less
heat
whether
the
same
matter
exists
as
ice
water
or
steam
the
number
and
nature
of
the
molecules
is
not
changed
only
in
the
one
case
they
are
close
to
one
another
and
solidly
linked
together
in
the
other
further
removed
and
free
to
move
about
one
another
though
still
held
together
as
a
mass
by
their
mutual
attractions
and
in
the
third
still
further
apart
so
that
their
mutual
attraction
is
lost
and
they
dart
about
each
with
its
own
proper
motion
bombarding
the
surface
which
contains
them
and
by
the
resultant
of
their
impacts
producing
pressure
in
this
latter
and
simpler
form
of
gas
the
following
laws
are
found
to
prevail
universally
for
all
substances
under
like
conditions
volumes
vary
directly
as
the
temperature
and
inversely
as
the
pressure
that
is
to
say
the
pressure
which
contains
them
remaining
the
same
equal
volumes
of
air
steam
or
any
other
substance
in
the
state
of
gas
expand
into
twice
the
volume
if
the
temperature
is
doubled
three
times
if
it
is
tripled
and
so
on
contracting
in
the
same
way
if
the
temperature
is
lowered
if
on
the
other
hand
the
temperature
remains
constant
the
volume
is
reduced
to
one
half
or
one
third
if
the
pressure
is
doubled
or
tripled
from
these
laws
the
further
grand
generalisation
has
been
arrived
at
that
all
substances
existing
in
the
form
of
gas
contain
the
same
number
of
molecules
in
the
same
volume
this
which
is
known
as
the
law
of
avogadro
from
the
italian
chemist
by
whom
it
was
first
discovered
is
the
fundamental
law
of
modern
chemistry
and
the
key
to
all
certain
and
scientific
knowledge
of
the
constitution
of
matter
and
of
the
domain
of
the
infinitely
small
just
as
much
as
the
law
of
gravity
is
to
action
of
matter
in
the
mass
and
the
resulting
conditions
and
motions
of
mechanics
and
astronomy
this
conclusion
obviously
follows
from
it
that
difference
of
weight
in
different
substances
arises
not
from
one
having
more
molecules
in
the
same
volume
than
another
but
from
the
molecules
themselves
being
heavier
if
we
weigh
a
gallon
or
litre
of
hydrogen
gas
which
is
the
lightest
known
substance
and
then
weighing
an
equal
volume
of
oxygen
gas
find
that
it
is
sixteen
times
heavier
we
know
for
certain
that
the
molecule
or
ultimate
particle
of
oxygen
is
sixteen
times
heavier
than
that
of
hydrogen
it
is
evident
that
in
this
way
the
molecules
of
all
simple
substances
which
can
exist
in
the
form
of
pure
gas
can
be
weighed
and
their
weight
expressed
in
terms
of
the
unit
which
is
generally
adopted
that
of
the
molecule
of
the
lightest
known
substance
hydrogen
but
science
not
content
with
this
achievement
wants
to
know
not
the
relative
weight
only
but
the
absolute
dimensions
qualities
and
motions
of
these
little
bodies
and
whether
although
they
can
not
be
divided
further
by
mechanical
means
and
while
retaining
the
qualities
of
the
substances
they
build
up
they
are
really
ultimate
and
indivisible
particles
or
themselves
composites
chemistry
and
electricity
give
a
ready
answer
to
this
latter
question
molecules
are
composites
of
still
smaller
bodies
and
to
get
back
to
the
ultimate
particle
we
must
go
to
atoms
all
chemical
changes
resolve
themselves
into
the
breaking
up
of
molecules
and
rearrangement
of
their
constituent
atoms
if
the
opposite
poles
of
a
voltaic
battery
are
inserted
in
a
vessel
containing
water
molecules
of
water
are
broken
up
bubbles
of
gas
rise
at
each
pole
and
if
these
are
collected
the
gas
at
the
positive
pole
is
found
to
be
oxygen
and
that
at
the
negative
pole
hydrogen
nothing
has
been
added
or
taken
away
for
the
weight
of
the
two
gases
evolved
exactly
equals
that
of
the
water
which
has
disappeared
but
the
molecules
of
the
water
have
been
broken
up
and
their
constituents
reappear
in
totally
different
forms
for
nothing
can
well
be
more
unlike
water
than
each
of
the
two
gases
of
which
it
is
composed
that
it
is
composed
of
them
can
be
verified
by
the
reverse
experiment
of
mixing
the
two
gases
together
in
the
same
proportion
of
two
volumes
of
hydrogen
to
one
of
oxygen
as
was
produced
by
the
decomposition
of
water
passing
an
electric
spark
through
the
vessel
containing
the
mixture
when
with
a
loud
explosion
the
gases
reunite
and
water
is
formed
in
precisely
the
same
quantity
as
produced
the
volumes
of
gas
by
its
decomposition
can
the
ultimate
particles
of
these
gases
be
further
subdivided
can
they
like
those
of
water
be
broken
up
and
reappear
in
new
forms
no
there
is
no
known
process
by
which
an
atom
of
oxygen
can
be
made
anything
but
oxygen
or
an
atom
of
hydrogen
anything
but
hydrogen
the
only
thing
which
is
compound
in
the
composition
of
oxygen
is
that
its
molecules
consist
of
two
atoms
linked
together
this
appears
from
the
fact
that
while
the
weight
of
oxygen
and
therefore
that
of
its
molecules
is
sixteen
times
greater
than
that
of
an
equal
volume
of
hydrogen
and
therefore
of
hydrogen
molecules
it
combines
with
it
in
the
proportion
not
of
sixteen
but
of
eight
to
one
if
therefore
the
molecule
were
identical
with
the
atom
of
oxygen
we
must
admit
that
the
atom
could
be
halved
which
is
contrary
to
its
definition
as
the
ultimate
indivisible
particle
of
the
substance
oxygen
but
if
the
oxygen
molecule
consists
of
two
linked
atoms
and
the
hydrogen
molecule
equally
of
two
as
can
be
proved
by
other
considerations
everything
is
explained
by
assuming
that
the
molecule
of
water
consists
of
two
atoms
of
hydrogen
linked
to
one
of
oxygen
or
and
that
when
this
molecule
is
broken
up
by
electricity
its
constituents
resolve
themselves
into
atoms
which
recombine
so
as
to
form
twice
as
many
molecules
of
hydrogen
as
of
oxygen
o
into
two
volumes
of
hydrogen
gas
to
one
of
oxygen
taking
the
single
hydrogen
atom
as
the
unit
of
weight
as
being
the
lightest
known
ponderable
body
and
calling
this
weight
a
microcrith
or
standard
of
the
smallest
of
this
order
of
excessively
small
weights
this
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
the
weight
of
an
oxygen
atom
is
equal
to
microcriths
and
as
water
is
composed
of
one
such
atom
plus
two
of
hydrogen
the
weight
of
its
molecule
ought
to
be
which
is
in
fact
the
exact
ratio
in
which
the
weight
of
a
volume
of
steam
or
water
in
the
form
of
gas
is
heavier
than
an
equal
volume
of
hydrogen
this
key
unlocks
the
whole
secret
of
the
chemical
changes
and
combinations
by
which
matter
assumes
all
the
various
forms
known
to
us
in
the
universe
thus
oxygen
enters
into
a
great
variety
of
combinations
forming
different
substances
but
always
in
the
proportion
which
is
either
or
some
multiple
of
such
as
that
is
either
or
atoms
of
oxygen
unite
with
other
atoms
to
form
the
molecules
from
which
these
other
substances
are
made
one
atom
of
oxygen
weighing
microcriths
combines
as
we
have
seen
with
two
atoms
of
hydrogen
weighing
to
form
a
molecule
of
water
weighing
mc
in
like
manner
one
atom
of
oxygen
combines
with
one
of
carbon
which
weighs
to
form
a
molecule
of
carbonic
oxide
weighing
mc
and
two
of
oxygen
with
one
of
carbon
to
form
a
molecule
of
carbonic
dioxide
weighing
mc
the
same
applies
to
all
elementary
substances
thus
hydrogen
two
atoms
of
which
combine
with
one
of
oxygen
to
form
water
combines
one
atom
to
one
with
chlorine
to
form
the
molecule
of
hydrochloric
acid
which
weighs
being
the
united
weights
of
one
atom
of
chlorine
and
one
of
hydrogen
mc
these
with
hundreds
of
similar
instances
are
the
results
not
of
theories
as
to
molecules
and
atoms
but
of
actual
facts
ascertained
by
innumerable
experiments
made
independently
by
careful
observers
over
long
periods
of
years
many
of
them
dating
back
to
the
labours
of
the
alchemists
of
the
middle
ages
in
pursuit
of
gold
the
atomic
theory
is
the
child
and
not
the
parent
of
the
facts
and
is
indeed
nothing
but
the
summary
of
the
vast
variety
of
experiments
which
led
up
to
it
as
law
of
gravity
is
of
the
facts
known
to
us
with
regard
to
the
attractions
and
motions
of
matter
in
the
mass
but
as
law
enables
us
to
predict
new
facts
to
calculate
eclipses
and
the
return
of
comets
beforehand
and
to
compile
nautical
almanacs
so
the
new
chemistry
based
on
the
atomic
theory
affords
the
same
conclusive
proof
of
its
truth
by
enabling
us
in
many
cases
to
predict
phenomena
which
are
subsequently
verified
by
experiment
and
to
infer
beforehand
what
combinations
are
possible
and
what
will
be
their
nature
the
actual
existence
therefore
of
molecules
and
atoms
is
as
a
fact
as
that
of
cwts
and
or
of
planets
and
stars
of
solar
systems
and
nebul√¶
the
researches
of
chemists
have
succeeded
in
discovering
about
substances
of
which
the
same
may
be
said
as
of
the
oxygen
and
hydrogen
into
which
water
is
decomposed
viz
that
they
can
not
be
decomposed
by
any
known
process
and
must
therefore
be
considered
as
ultimate
and
elementary
their
atoms
differ
widely
in
size
and
weight
that
of
mercury
for
instance
being
times
heavier
than
that
of
hydrogen
and
the
weights
varying
from
mc
for
the
hydrogen
atom
up
to
for
that
of
uranium
when
we
call
them
elementary
substances
we
merely
mean
that
we
know
no
means
of
decomposing
them
it
is
possible
that
all
of
them
may
be
compounds
which
we
can
not
take
to
pieces
of
some
substratum
of
uniform
matter
and
it
is
remarkable
that
the
weight
of
nearly
all
of
these
elementary
atoms
is
some
simple
multiple
of
that
of
hydrogen
pointing
to
their
being
all
combinations
of
one
common
substratum
of
matter
but
this
is
merely
conjecture
and
in
the
present
state
of
our
knowledge
we
must
assume
these
or
ultimate
particles
or
atoms
to
be
the
indivisible
units
out
of
which
all
the
complicated
puzzle
of
the
material
universe
is
put
together
they
are
not
all
equally
important
to
us
of
the
elementary
substances
enumerated
in
chemical
treatises
are
doubtful
and
to
of
the
remainder
are
either
known
only
to
chemists
in
minute
quantities
or
exist
in
nature
in
small
quantities
having
no
very
material
bearing
upon
relation
to
matter
the
most
important
are
oxygen
hydrogen
nitrogen
and
carbon
oxygen
diluted
by
nitrogen
gives
us
the
air
we
breathe
combined
with
hydrogen
the
water
we
drink
and
with
metals
and
other
primitive
bases
the
solid
earth
on
which
we
tread
carbon
again
is
the
great
basis
of
organised
matter
and
life
to
which
it
leads
up
by
a
variety
of
complex
combinations
with
oxygen
hydrogen
and
nitrogen
the
qualities
and
relations
of
elementary
atoms
afford
a
subject
of
great
interest
but
of
such
vast
extent
that
those
who
wish
to
understand
it
must
be
referred
to
professed
works
on
modern
chemistry
for
the
present
purpose
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
following
conclusions
are
firmly
established
all
the
various
forms
of
matter
are
composed
of
combinations
of
primitive
atoms
which
form
molecules
the
molecules
being
neither
more
nor
less
than
very
small
pieces
of
ordinary
matter
the
qualities
of
this
matter
or
what
is
the
same
thing
of
its
molecules
depend
partly
on
the
qualities
of
the
atoms
which
are
something
quite
distinct
from
those
of
the
molecules
and
partly
on
their
mode
of
aggregation
into
molecules
affecting
the
form
size
stability
and
other
attributes
of
the
molecule
all
matter
down
to
the
smallest
atom
has
definite
weight
and
is
indestructible
no
man
by
taking
thought
can
add
the
millionth
of
a
milligramme
to
the
weight
of
any
substance
or
make
it
either
more
or
less
than
the
sum
of
the
weights
of
its
component
factors
any
more
than
he
can
add
a
cubit
to
his
stature
when
shelley
sang
of
the
cloud
i
change
but
i
can
not
die
he
enunciated
a
scientific
axiom
of
the
first
importance
creation
in
the
sense
of
making
something
out
of
nothing
is
a
thing
absolutely
unknown
and
unknowable
to
us
if
we
say
we
a
ship
or
a
we
simply
mean
that
we
transform
existing
matter
and
existing
energies
into
new
combinations
which
give
results
convenient
for
our
purpose
so
if
we
talk
of
making
a
world
our
idea
really
is
that
if
our
powers
and
knowledge
were
indefinitely
increased
we
might
be
able
given
the
atoms
and
energies
with
their
laws
of
existence
to
put
them
together
so
as
to
produce
the
desired
results
but
how
the
atoms
and
their
inherent
laws
got
there
is
a
question
as
to
which
knowledge
or
even
conceivability
is
impossible
for
it
altogether
transcends
human
experience
before
finally
taking
leave
of
atoms
it
may
be
well
to
state
shortly
that
science
not
content
with
having
proved
their
existence
and
weighed
them
in
terms
of
the
lightest
element
the
hydrogen
atom
has
attempted
not
without
success
to
solve
the
more
difficult
problem
of
their
real
dimensions
intervals
and
velocities
this
problem
has
been
attacked
by
clausius
sir
thomson
clerk
maxwell
and
others
from
various
sides
from
a
comparison
with
the
of
light
with
the
tenuity
of
the
thinnest
films
of
just
before
they
burst
and
when
they
are
presumably
reduced
to
a
single
layer
of
molecules
and
from
the
kinetic
theory
of
gases
involving
the
dimensions
paths
and
velocities
of
elastic
bodies
constantly
colliding
and
by
their
impacts
producing
the
resulting
pressure
on
the
confining
surface
all
these
methods
involve
such
refined
mathematical
calculations
that
it
is
impossible
to
explain
them
popularly
but
they
all
lead
to
nearly
identical
results
which
involve
figures
so
marvellous
as
to
be
almost
incomprehensible
for
instance
a
cubic
centimetre
of
air
is
calculated
to
contain
trillions
of
times
the
cube
of
a
million
or
followed
by
ciphers
the
average
distance
between
each
molecule
equals
millionths
of
a
millimetre
which
is
about
times
smaller
than
the
smallest
magnitude
visible
under
a
microscope
the
average
velocity
of
each
molecule
is
metres
per
second
and
the
average
number
of
impacts
received
by
each
molecule
in
a
second
is
millions

the

to
the

that
if

as

expresses

its

of

be
something
between
the

of

extraordinary
as
these
dimensions
are
they
are
not
more
so
than
those
at
the
opposite
extremity
of
the

where
the
distance
of

and
nebul√¶
has
to
be
measured
by
the
number
of
thousand
years
their
light
travelling
at
the
rate
of
miles

takes
to
reach
us
infinitely
small
however
as
those
dimensions
appear
to
our
original
conceptions
derived
from
our
natural
senses
they
are
certain
and
ascertained
facts
if
not
as
to
the
precise
figures
yet
beyond
all
doubt
as
to
the
orders
of
magnitude
in
dealing
with
them
also
we
are
to
a
great
extent
on
familiar
ground
molecules
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
small
pieces
of
ordinary
matter
and
atoms
are
also
matter
for
they
obey
the
law
of
gravity
have
definite
weights
and
build
up
molecules
as
surely
as
molecules
build
up
ordinary
matter
and
as
squared
stones
build
up
pyramids
but
to
understand
the
constitution
of
the
material
universe
we
must
go
a
step
further
part
from
the
familiar
world
of
sense
and
deal
with
an
medium
which
is
at
the
same
time
matter
and
not
matter
which
lies
outside
the
laws
of
gravity
and
yet
obeys
other
laws
intelligible
and
calculable
by
us
of
which
it
may
be
said
we
know
it
and
we
know
it
not
we
call
it
ether
ether
is
a
medium
assumed
as
a
necessary
consequence
from
the
phenomena
of
light
heat
and
from
those
of
light
respecting
light
two
facts
are
known
to
us
with
absolute
certainty
it
traverses
space
at
the
rate
of
miles
per
second
it
is
propagated
not
by
particles
actually
travelling
at
this
rate
but
like
sound
through
air
by
the
transmission
of
waves
the
first
fact
is
known
from
the
difference
of
time
at
which
eclipses
of
satellites
are
seen
according
as
the
earth
is
at
the
point
of
its
orbit
nearest
to
or
farthest
from
from
the
time
light
takes
to
traverse
the
diameter
of
the
orbit
which
is
about
millions
of
miles
and
this
velocity
of
light
is
confirmed
by
direct
experiments
as
by
noting
the
difference
of
time
between
seeing
the
flash
and
hearing
the
sound
of
a
gun
which
gives
the
velocity
of
light
compared
with
the
known
velocity
of
sound
the
second
fact
is
equally
certain
from
the
phenomena
of
what
are
called
interferences
when
the
crest
of
one
wave
just
overtakes
the
hollow
of
a
preceding
one
so
that
if
the
two
waves
are
of
equal
magnitude
the
oscillations
exactly
neutralise
one
another
and
two
lights
produce
darkness
this
is
shown
in
a
thousand
different
ways
and
for
all
the
different
colours
depending
on
different
waves
into
which
white
light
is
analysed
when
passed
through
a
prism
it
is
a
certain
result
of
and
of
only
and
therefore
we
know
without
a
doubt
that
light
is
propagated
by
waves
but
waves
imply
a
medium
through
which
waveforms
are
transmitted
for
waves
are
nothing
but
the
rhythmic
motion
of
something
which
rises
and
falls
or
oscillates
symmetrically
about
a
mean
position
of
rest
slowly
or
quickly
according
to
the
less
or
greater
elasticity
of
the
medium
the
waves
which
run
along
a
large
and
slack
wire
are
large
and
slow
those
along
a
small
and
tightly
stretched
wire
are
small
and
quick
and
from
the
data
we
possess
as
to
light
its
velocity
of
transmission
its
refraction
when
its
waves
pass
from
one
medium
into
another
of
different
density
and
from
the
distance
between
the
waves
as
shown
by
interference
it
is
easy
to
calculate
the
lengths
and
vibratory
periods
of
the
waves
and
the
elasticity
of
the
medium
through
which
such
waves
are
transmitted
the
figures
at
which
we
arrive
are
truly
extraordinary
the
dimensions
and
rates
of
oscillations
of
the
waves
which
produce
the
different
colours
of
visible
light
have
been
measured
and
calculated
with
the
greatest
accuracy
and
they
are
as
follows
dimensions
of
colours
of
waves
of
oscillations
in
one
inch
one
second
the
elasticity
of
this
wonderful
medium
is
even
more
extraordinary
the
rapidity
with
which
is
transmitted
depends
other
things
being
equal
on
the
elasticity
of
the
medium
which
is
proportional
to
the
square
of
the
velocity
with
which
a
wave
travels
through
it
as
the
velocity
of
the
in
air
is
about
feet
in
a
second
and
that
of
the
about
miles
in
the
same
time
it
follows
that
the
velocity
of
the
latter
is
about
a
million
times
greater
than
that
of
the
former
and
if
the
density
of
ether
were
the
same
as
that
of
air
its
elasticity
must
be
about
a
million
million
times
greater
but
the
elasticity
is
the
same
thing
as
the
power
of
resisting
compression
which
in
the
case
of
air
we
know
to
be
about
pounds
to
the
square
inch
so
that
the
ether
if
equally
dense
would
balance
a
pressure
of
million
million
pounds
to
the
square
is
it
would
require
a
pressure
of
about
millions
of
tons
to
the
square
inch
to
condense
ether
to
the
density
of
air
on
the
other
hand
its
density
if
any
must
be
so
infinitesimally
small
that
the
earth
moving
through
it
in
its
orbit
with
a
velocity
of
miles
a
minute
suffers
no
perceptible
retardation
consider
what
this
means
air
blowing
at
the
rate
of
miles
an
hour
is
a
hurricane
uprooting
trees
and
levelling
houses
if
ether
were
as
dense
as
air
the
resistance
to
the
earth
in
passing
through
it
would
be
times
that
of
going
dead
to
windward
in
a
tropical
hurricane
but
in
point
of
fact
there
is
no
sensible
resistance
for
the
earth
and
heavenly
bodies
move
in
their
calculated
paths
according
to
the
law
of
gravity
exactly
as
they
would
do
if
they
were
moving
in
a
vacuum
even
the
comets
which
consist
of
such
excessively
rare
matter
that
when
one
of
them
got
entangled
among
the
satellites
of
jupiter
it
did
not
affect
their
movements
are
not
retarded
by
the
ether
or
so
slightly
that
any
retardation
in
the
case
of
one
or
two
of
them
is
suspected
rather
than
proved
but
if
the
ether
has
no
weight
how
can
we
call
it
material
weight
being
as
we
have
seen
the
invariable
test
and
measure
of
all
matter
down
to
the
minutest
atom
and
yet
how
can
we
deny
its
existence
when
it
is
demonstrably
necessary
to
account
for
undoubted
facts
revealed
to
us
every
day
by
the
prism
the
spectroscope
electricity
and
chemical
action
and
deductions
from
these
facts
based
on
the
strict
laws
of
mathematical
calculation
for
the
existence
of
the
ether
is
not
based
only
on
the
phenomena
of
light
it
is
an
equally
necessary
postulate
to
explain
those
of
heat
electricity
and
chemical
action
we
must
conceive
of
our
atoms
and
molecules
as
forming
systems
and
performing
their
movements
not
in
vacuo
but
in
an
medium
of
this
ether
to
which
they
impart
and
from
which
they
receive
impulses
these
impulses
are
excessively
minute
and
when
they
occur
in
irregular
order
they
produce
no
appreciable
effect
but
when
the
vibrations
of
the
ether
keep
time
with
those
of
the
atoms
the
multitude
of
small
effects
becomes
summed
up
into
one
considerable
enough
to
produce
great
changes
just
so
a
rhythmic
succession
of
tiny
ripples
may
set
a
heavy
buoy
oscillating
and
the
footfalls
of
a
regiment
of
soldiers
marching
over
a
may
make
it
swing
until
it
breaks
down
while
a
confused
mob
could
traverse
it
in
safety
the
latter
affords
a
good
illustration
of
the
way
in
which
molecular
structures
may
be
broken
down
and
their
atoms
set
free
to
enter
into
other
combinations
by
the
action
of
heat
light
or
chemical
rays
beyond
the
visible
end
of
the
spectrum
conversely
the
phenomena
of
the
spectroscope
all
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
vibrations
of
atoms
and
molecules
can
propagate
waves
through
the
ether
as
well
as
absorb
into
their
own
motions
and
thus

of

the
fact
that

us
from

remotest
stars
and
nebul√¶
and
that
in
this
light
the
spectroscope
enables
us
to
detect
waves
propagated
and
absorbed
by
the
very
same
vibrations
of
the
same
familiar
atoms
at
these
enormous
distances

at

surface

hydrogen
for
instance
is
a
principal
ingredient
of
the
atmosphere
and
of
those
distant
suns
we
call
stars
and
it
affects
the
ether
and
is
affected
by
it
exactly
in
the
same
manner
as
the
hydrogen
burning
in
an
ordinary
in
the
direction
also
of
the
infinitely
small
ether
permeates
the
apparently
solid
structure
of
crystals
whose
molecules
perform
their
limited
and
rigidly
definite
movements
in
an
atmosphere
of
it
as
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
so
many
cases
light
and
heat
penetrate
through
them
a
whole
series
of
remarkable
phenomena
arise
from
the
manner
in
which
the
vibrations
of
ether
which
cause
light
are
affected
by
the
structure
of
the
molecules
of
crystals
through
which
they
pass
in
certain
cases
they
are
what
is
called
polarised
or
so
affected
that
while
they
pass
freely
if
the
crystal
is
held
in
one
direction
they
are
stopped
if
it
is
turned
round
through
an
angle
of
to
its
former
position
so
that
one
and
the
same
crystal
may
be
alternately
transparent
and
it
would
seem
as
if
its
structure
were
like
that
of
wood
grained
and
more
easy
to
penetrate
if
cut
with
the
grain
than
against
it
so
that
when
a
ray
of
light
attempted
to
penetrate
its
vibrations
were
resolved
into
two
one
with
the
grain
which
got
through
the
other
against
it
which
was
suppressed
so
that
the
emerging
ray
which
entered
with
a
circular
vibration
got
out
with
only
one
rectilinear
vibration
parallel
to
the
diameter
which
coincided

the
grain

more
complicated
structure

similar

that
induced
in
the
iron
filings

brought
under
the
influence
of
the
two
poles
of
the
magnet
with
this
polarised
light
the
most
beautiful
coloured
rings
can
be
produced
from
the
waves
of
the
different
colours
into
which
the
white
light
has
been
analysed
in
passing
through
the
crystal
which
alternately
flash
out
and
disappear
as
the
crystal
is
turned
round
its
axis
and
which
present
a
remarkable
analogy
to
the
curves
into
which
the
iron
filings
form
themselves
under
the
single
or
double
poles
of
the
magnet
the
importance
of
this
will
appear
afterwards
but
for
the
present
it
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
waves
of
ether
which
cause
light
really
penetrate
through
the
molecules
of
crystals

in
doing
so

be

in
dealing
with
these
excessively
small
magnitudes
it
may
assist
the
reader
who
has
some
acquaintance
with
mathematics
in
forming
some
conception
of
them
to
refer
to
that
refinement
of
calculation
the
differential
and
integral
calculus
and
even
the
reader
may
find
it
worth
while
to
give
a
little
attention
in
order
to
gain
some
idea
of
this
celebrated
calculus
which
was
the
key
by
which
newton
and
his
successors
unlocked
the
mysteries
of
the
heavens
the
first
rough
idea
of
it
is
gained
by
considering
what
would
happen
if
in
a
calculation
involving
hundreds
of
miles
we
neglected
inches
suppose
we
had
a
block
of
land
to
measure
miles
long
and
wide
as
there
are
say
feet
in
a
mile
and
the
error
from
omitting
inches
could
not
exceed
a
foot
the
utmost
error
in
the
measurement
of
length
could
not
exceed
and
in
width
part
of
the
correct
amount
in
the
area
of
square
miles
the
limit
of
error
would
by
adding
or
omitting
the
rectangle
formed
by
multiplying
together
these
two
small
errors
not
exceed
part
it
is
evident
that
the
first
error
is
an
excessively
small
part
of
the
true
figure
and
the
second
error
a
still
more
excessively
small
part
of
the
first
error
but
as
we
are
dealing
with
abstract
numbers
we
can
just
as
readily
conceive
our
initial
error
to
be
the
or
of
an
inch
as
one
inch
and
in
fact
diminish
it
until
it
becomes
an
infinitesimally
small
or
evanescent
quantity
in
doing
so
however
it
is
evident
that
we
shall
make
the
second
error
such
a
still
more
infinitesimally
small
fraction
of
the
first
that
it
may
be
considered
as
altogether
disappearing
the
first
error
is
called
a
differential
of
the
first
order
and
denoted
by
the
second
a
differential
of
the
second
order
denoted
by
thus
if
we
call
the
base
of
our
rectangle
and
its
height
the
area
will
be
let
us
suppose
to
receive
the
addition
of
a
very
small
increment
and
the
corresponding
increment
what
will
be
the
corresponding
increment
of
the
area
or
clearly
the
difference
between
the
old
area
and
the
new
area
multiplied
by
this
multiplication
gives
the
difference
between
this
and
is
but
is
as
we
have
seen
a
differential
of
the
second
order
and
may
be
neglected
therefore
in
like
manner
which
last
term
may
be
neglected
and
in
this
way
the
differentials
of
all
manner
of
functions
and
equations
of
symbols
representing
dimensions
and
motions
may
be
found
conversely
the
wholes
may
be
considered
as
made
up
of
an
infinite
number
of
these
infinitely
small
parts
and
found
from
them
by
summing
up
or
integrating
the
differentials
thus
if
we
had
the
equation
we
know
that
the
side
is
the
differential
of
and
therefore
that
by
integrating
it
we
shall
get
while
the
right
side
is
the
differential
of
which
we
shall
get
by
integrating
it
the
relation
expressed
therefore
is
that
or
in
other
words
that
a
rectangle
whose
sides
are
and
exactly
equals
a
square
whose
side
is
illustration
fig
fig
fig
the
use
of
this
device
in
assisting
calculation
will
be
apparent
if
we
take
the
case
of
an
area
bounded
by
a
curved
line
we
can
not
directly
calculate
this
area
but
we
can
easily
tell
that
of
a
rectangle
now
it
is
evident
that
if
we
inscribe
rectangles
in
this
area
abc
the
more
rectangles
we
inscribe
the
less
will
be
the
error
in
taking
their
sum
as
equal
to
the
curved
area
this
is
apparent
if
we
compare
fig
with
fig
suppose
we
take
a
point
p
on
the
curve
call
bn
and
pn
and
suppose
to
be
the
differentially
small
increment
of
and
the
corresponding
small
increment
of
the
area
of
the
rectangle
pn
and
differs
from
the
true
curvilinear
area
by
less
than
the
little
rectangle
of
or
of
but
as
we
have
seen
if
we
push
our
division
to
the
first
infinitesimal
order
or
make
and
differentials
of
and
may
be
multiply
the
number
of
rectangles
indefinitely
and
the
sum
of
their
areas
will
differ
from
the
true
area
inclosed
by
the
curve
by
an
error
which
is
evanescent
if
then
and
are
connected
by
some
fixed
law
as
must
be
the
case
if
the
extremity
of
traces
out
some
regular
curve
the
relation
between
them
may
be
expressed
by
an
equation
which
will
remain
one
however
often
it
may
be
differentiated
or
again
integrated
and
whatever
modifications
or
transformations
it
may
receive
by
mathematical
processes
which
do
not
alter
the
essential
equality
of
the
two
sides
connected
by
the
symbol
of
equality
thus
by
differentiating
and
casting
off
as
evanescent
all
differentials
of
a
lower
order
than
that
which
we
are
working
with
we
may
arrive
at
forms
of
which
we
know
the
integrals
and
by
integrating
get
back
to
the
results
in
ordinary
numbers
which
we
were
in
search
of
but
could
not
attain
directly
the
same
thing
will
apply
if
our
symbols
are
more
numerous
and
if
they
express
relations
of
motion
as
well
as
of
space
or
in
fact
any
relations
which
are
governed
by
fixed
laws
expressible
by
equations
if
i
have
succeeded
in
conveying
to
the
readers
any
idea
of
this
celebrated
calculus
they
will
perceive
what
an
analogy
it
presents
to
the
idea
of
modern
physical
and
chemical
science
that
of
molecules
atoms
and
ether
forming
differentials
of
successive
orders
of
the
infinitely
small
it
is
certainly
most
remarkable
that
while
the
former
was
a
purely
intellectual
idea
based
on
mathematical
abstractions
and
which
was
invented
and
worked
as
an
instrument
for
solving
the
most
intricate
astronomical
problems
for
nearly
two
centuries
without
a
suspicion
that
it
represented
any
objective
reality
the
latter
idea
based
on
actual
experiment
seems
to
show
that
differentials
and
integrals
have
their
real
counterpart
in
nature
and
represent
fundamental
facts
in
the
constitution
of
the
universe
those
who
are
of
a
mystic
or
metaphysical
turn
of
mind
may
discern
in
this
arguments
for
matter
and
laws
of
matter
being
after
all
only
manifestations
of
one
universal
mind
but
in
following
such
speculations
we
should
be
deserting
the
solid
earth
for
cloudland
and
passing
the
limit
of
positive
knowledge
into
the
region
where
reflections
of
our
own
hopes
fears
religious
feelings
and
poetical
sentiments
form
and
dissolve
themselves
against
the
background
of
the
great
unknown
for
the
present
therefore
i
confine
myself
to
pointing
out
how
these
undoubted
truths
of
mathematical
science
which
have
verified
themselves
in
the
practical
form
of
enabling
us
to
predict
eclipses
and
construct
nautical
almanacs
correspond
with
and
throw
light
upon
the
equally
certain
facts
of
this
succession
of
infinitely
small
quantities
of
successive
orders
in
the
constitution
of
matter
an
attempt
has
recently
been
made
based
on
abstruse
mathematical
calculations
to
carry
our
knowledge
of
the
constitution
of
matter
one
step
further
back
and
identify
atoms
with
ether
this
is
attempted
by
the
vortex
theory
of
helmholz
sir
thomson
and
professor
tait
it
is
singular
how
some
of
the
ultimate
facts
discovered
by
the
refinements
of
science
correspond
with
some
of
the
most
trivial
amusements
thus
the
blowing
of
gives
the
best
clue
to
the
movement
of
waves
of
light
and
through
them
to
the
dimensions
of
molecules
and
atoms
and
the
collision
of
knocked
about
at
random
to
the
movements
of
those
minute
bodies
and
the
kinetic
theory
of
gases
in
the
case
of
the
vortex
theory
the
idea
is
given
by
the
rings
of
smoke
which
certain
adroit
smokers
amuse
themselves
by
puffing
into
the
air
these
rings
float
for
a
considerable
time
retaining
their
circular
form
and
showing
their
elasticity
by
oscillating
about
it
and
returning
to
it
if
their
form
is
altered
and
by
rebounding
and
vibrating
energetically
just
as
two
solid
elastic
bodies
would
do
if
two
rings
come
into
collision
if
we
try
to
cut
them
in
two
they
recede
before
the
knife
or
bend
round
it
returning
when
the
external
force
is
removed
to
their
original
form
without
the
loss
of
a
single
particle
and
preserving
their
own
individuality
through
every
change
of
form
and
of
velocity
this
persistence
of
form
they
owe
to
the
fact
that
their
particles
are
revolving
in
small
circles
at
right
angles
to
the
axis
or
circumference
of
the
larger
circle
which
forms
the
ring
motion
thus
giving
them
stability
very
much
as
in
the
familiar
instance
of
the
bicycle
they
burst
at
last
because
they
are
formed
and
rotate
in
the
air
which
is
a
resisting
medium
but
mathematical
calculation
shows
that
in
a
perfect
fluid
free
from
all
friction
these
vortex
rings
would
be
indivisible
and
indestructible
in
other
words
they
would
be
atoms
the
vortex
theory
assumes
therefore
that
the
universe
consists
of
one
uniform
primary
substance
a
fluid
which
fills
all
space
and
that
what
we
call
matter
consists
of
portions
of
this
fluid
which
have
become
animated
with
vortex
motion
the
innumerable
atoms
which
form
molecules
and
through
molecules
all
the
diversified
forms
of
matter
of
the
material
universe
are
therefore
simply
so
many
vortex
rings
each
perfectly
limited
distinct
and
indestructible
both
as
to
its
form
mass
and
mode
of
motion
they
can
not
change
or
disappear
nor
can
they
be
formed
spontaneously
those
of
the
same
kind
are
constituted
after
the
same
fashion
and
therefore
are
endowed
with
the
same
properties
the
theory
is
a
plausible
one
and
the
reputation
of
its
authors
must
command
for
it
respectful
consideration
but
it
is
as
yet
a
long
way
from
being
an
established
theory
which
can
be
accepted
as
a
true
representation
of
facts
in
the
first
place
it
is
based
solely
on
mathematical
theory
and
not
as
in
the
case
of
atoms
and
upon
actual
facts
of
weight
and
measurement
tested
by
experiment
and
to
which
mathematical
reasoning
affords
only
an
aid
and
supplement
no
one
has
proved
the
existence
of
such
a
medium
or
of
such
vortex
rings
much
less
weighed
or
measured
them
moreover
the
theory
is
open
to
some
very
obvious
objections
how
can
aggregations
of
imponderable
matter
acquire
weight
and
become
subject
to
the
law
of
gravity
which
as
we
have
seen
is
one
of
the
essential
and
permanent
qualities
of
atoms
if
a
cubic
millionth
of
a
millimetre
of
ether
formed
into
a
big
vortex
ring
of
say
an
atom
of
mercury
has
a
weight
equal
to
times
that
of
an
atom
of
hydrogen
which
itself
has
a
definite
weight
why
has
it
no
weight
in
its
original
form
and
if
it
had
weight
however
small
how
could
the
enormous
mass
of
ether
filling
all
space
produce
no
perceptible
effect
on
bodies
even
of
attenuated
cometic
vapour
revolving
through
it
with
immense
velocities
again
how
could
these
innumerable
vortex
rings
be
formed
out
of
the
ether
without
disturbing
the
uniformity
and
continuity
of
the
medium
which
are
essential
for
the
propagation
of
the
through
it
and
how
could
the
motions
requisite
to
form
the
vortex
rings
be
impressed
on
them
consistently
with
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
energy
can
no
more
be
created
out
of
nothing
than
matter
by
any
process
known
in
nature
or
conceivable
by
the
human
intellect
and
to
assume
it
is
simply
a
more
refined
manner
of
falling
back
on
the
supernatural
which
is
itself
only
a
more
refined
manner
of
saying
that
we
know
nothing
for
the
present
therefore
we
must
be
content
with
atoms
and
ether
as
the
ultimate
terms
of
our
knowledge
of
the
material
or
components
of

in

apt
to
be

with

a
comprehensive

whatever
produces

thus
if

which
it
is
bent
may
either
reappear
at
once
in
the
flight
of
the

it
may
remain

if

trigger
in
the
former
case
it
is
called
energy

in
the
latter

it
is
important
to
realise
this
distinction
clearly

harmonious
arrangements

on
the
polarity

of
suspension
it
would
so
swing
for
ever
but
in
thus
swinging
what
happens
from
a
b
to
a
c
energy
of
motion
keeps
gaining
on
energy
of
position
until
when
the
pendulum
reaches
c
it
has
annihilated
it
energy
of
position
has
entirely
disappeared
and
the
whole
original
force
expended
in
raising
the
pendulum
to
a
b
exactly
reappears
in
the
force
or
momentum
of
the
pendulum
at
its
lowest
point
but
is
this
victory
final
by
no
means
energy
of
position
having
touched
bottom
gathers
like
ant√¶us
fresh
vigour
for
the
contest
and
from
the
position
a
c
upwards
it
gains
ground
on
its
adversary
until
when
the
pendulum
reaches
a
d
it
is
in
its
turn
completely
victorious
the
same
alternation
between
energy
of
motion
and
of
position
takes
place
in
all
rhythmical
movements
such
as
waves
which
whether
in
water
air
or
ether
are
propagated
as
in
the
case
of
the
pendulum
by
particles
forced
out
of
their
position
of
rest
and
oscillating
between
the
two
energies
illustration
thus
if
waves
run
along
an
elastic
wire
a
b
the
particle
p
which
has
been
forced
into
the
position
oscillates
backwards
and
forwards
between
and
beginning
with
nothing
but
energy
of
position
at
losing
it
all
for
energy
of
motion
at
p
and
regaining
it
at
all
is
to
say
all
sound
light
and
on
this
primitive
polarity
if
we
have
got
this
definition
of
the
two
forms
of
energy
clearly
into
our
heads
we
shall
be
the
better
prepared
for
this
further
grandest
perhaps
in
the
whole
range
of
modern
energy
like
matter
is
indestructible
and
can
only
be
transformed
but
never
created
or
annihilated
this
is
at
first
sight
a
more
difficult
proposition
to
establish
in
the
case
of
energy
than
in
that
of
matter
in
the
latter
case
we
have
nothing
in
our
experience
that
can
lead
us
to
suppose
that
we
have
ever
created
something
out
of
nothing
but
in
the
former
our
first
impression
undoubtedly
is
that
we
do
create
force
if
i
throw
a
stone
at
a
bird
i
have
an
instinctive
impression
that
the
force
which
projects
the
stone
is
the
creation
of
my
own
conscious
will
that
i
had
the
choice
either
to
throw
or
not
to
throw
and
that
if
i
had
decided
not
to
throw
the
impelling
force
would
never
have
existed
but
if
we
look
more
closely
at
the
matter
it
is
not
really
so
the
chain
of
events
is
this
the
first
impulse
proceeds
from
the
visual
rays
which
concentrated
by
the
lens
of
the
eye
on
the
retina
give
an
image
of
the
bird
this
sends
vibrations
along
the
optic
nerve
to
the
brain
setting
in
motion
certain
molecules
of
that
organ
these
again
send
vibrations
along
other
nerves
to
certain
muscles
of
the
arm
and
hand
which
contract
and
by
doing
so
give
out
the
energy
of
movement
which
throws
the
stone
all
this
process
is
strictly
mechanical
the
eye
acts
precisely
like
a
camera
obscura
in
forming
the
image
the
though
not
identical
with
those
of
the
wires
of
an
electric
telegraph
are
of
the
same
nature
their
velocity
can
be
measured
and
their
presence
detected
by
the
galvanometer
the
energy
of
the
muscle
is
stored
there
by
the
slow
combustion
of
the
food
we
have
eaten
in
the
oxygen
of
the
air
we
have
breathed
take
any
of
these
conditions
away
and
no
effort
of
the
will
can
produce
the
result
if
the
nerve
is
paralysed
or
the
muscle
from
prolonged
starvation
has
no
energy
left
the
stone
will
not
be
thrown
however
much
we
may
desire
to
kill
the
bird
again
precisely
the
same
circle
of
events
takes
place
in
numerous
instances
without
any
intervention
of
this
additional
factor
of
conscious
will
we
breathe
mechanically
the
muscles
of
the
chest
causing
it
to
rise
and
fall
like
the
waves
of
the
ocean
without
any
deliberate
intention
of
taking
air
into
the
lungs
and
exhaling
it
nay
more
there
are
instances
of
what
was
at
first
accompanied
by
the
sensation
of
conscious
will
ceasing
to
be
so
when
the
molecular
movements
had
made
channels
for
themselves
as
when
a
who
had
learned
his
notes
with
difficulty
ends
by
playing
a
complicated
piece
automatically
the
case
of
animals
also
raises
another
difficulty
suppose
a
retriever
dog
sees
his
master
shoot
at
and
miss
a
hare
shall
he
obey
the
promptings
of
his
animal
instinct
and
give
chase
or
those
of
his
higher
moral
nature
which
tell
him
that
it
is
wrong
to
do
so
without
the
word
of
command
it
is
hard
to
see
how
this
differs
from
the
case
of
a
man
resisting
or
yielding
to
temptation
and
how
if
we
assign
conscious
will
to
the
man
we
can
deny
it
to
the
dog
reasoning
from
these
premises
some
philosophers
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
man
and
all
animals
are
but
mechanical
automata
cleverly
constructed
to
work
in
a
certain
way
fitting
in
with
the
equally
preordained
course
of
outward
phenomena
and
that
the
sensation
of
will
is
merely
an
illusion
arising
as
a
last
refinement
in
the
adjustment
of
the
machinery
but
here
comes
in
that
principle
of
duality
or
polarity
by
which
a
proposition
may
be
at
once
true
and
untrue
and
two
contradictory
opposites
exist
together
no
amount
of
philosophical
reasoning
can
make
us
believe
that
we
are
altogether
machines
and
not
free
agents
it
runs
off
us
like
water
from
a
back
and
leaves
us
in
presence
of
the
intuitive
conviction
that
to
a
great
extent
man
is
man
and
master
of
his
fate
if
this
be
an
illusion
why
not
of
the
senses
experiment
natural
law
science
as
well
as
morality
and
religion
to
pursue
this
farther
would
lead
us
far
astray
into
the
misty
realm
of
metaphysics
and
i
refer
to
it
only
as
showing
that
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
standing
as
it
does
in
apparent
contradiction
to
our
natural
impressions
requires
a
fuller
demonstration
than
the
kindred
principle
of
the
indestructibility
of
matter
illustration
in
the
case
of
ordinary
mechanical
power
it
had
been
long
known
that
the
intervention
of
machinery
did
not
create
force
but
only
transformed
it
if
a
weight
of
a
just
balances
a
weight
of
b
by
aid
of
a
pulley
and
by
the
addition
of
a
minute
fraction
such
as
a
grain
raises
it
foot
it
will
be
invariably
found
that
a
has
descended
feet
in
other
words
lb
working
through
feet
does
exactly
the
same
work
as
lbs
working
through
foot
and
whatever
may
be
the
intervening
machinery
the
same
thing
holds
good
and
the
work
put
in
at
one
end
comes
out
neither
more
nor
less
at
the
other
except
for
a
minute
loss
due
to
friction
and
resistance
of
air
if
a
force
equal
to
lb
is
made
by
multiplying
the
intermediate
machinery
to
raise
a
ton
a
foot
from
the
ground
exactly
as
much
force
must
have
been
exerted
as
if
the
ton
had
been
divided
into
parts
of
lb
each
and
each
part
separately
lifted
but
although
energy
can
not
be
created
at
first
sight
it
seems
as
if
it
might
be
destroyed
as
when
the
ton
falls
to
the
ground
and
seems
to
have
lost
all
its
energy
whether
of
motion
or
of
position
but
here
science
steps
in
and
shows
us
that
it
is
not
destroyed
but
simply
transformed
into
another
sort
of
motion
which
we
call
heat
some
connection
between
mechanical
work
and
heat
had
long
been
known
as
in
the
familiar
experiment
of
rubbing
our
hands
together
to
warm
them
and
the
practice
known
to
most
primitive
races
of
obtaining
fire
by
twirling
a
stick
rapidly
in
a
hole
drilled
in
a
block
of
wood
a
practice
described
by
the
old
sanskrit
word
which
means
an
instrument
for
obtaining
fire
by
pressure
or
friction
and
which
translated
into
greek
has
been
immortalised
by
the
legend
of
prometheus
but
it
was
reserved
for
recent
years
and
for
an
english
philosopher
joule
to
give
scientific
precision
and
generality
to
this
idea
by
actually
measuring
the
amount
of
heat
produced
by
a
given
amount
of
work
and
showing
that
they
were
in
all
cases
convertible
terms
so
much
heat
for
so
much
work
and
so
much
work
for
so
much
heat
he
did
this
by
measuring
accurately
by
a
thermometer
the
heat
added
to
a
given
amount
of
water
by
the
work
done
by
a
set
of
paddles
revolving
in
it
set
in
rapid
motion
by
a
known
weight
descending
through
a
known
space
the
unit
of
work
being
taken
as
that
sufficient
to
raise
kilogramme
through
metre
and
that
of
heat
as
that
required
to
raise
the
temperature
of
one
kilogramme
of
water
by
centigrade
the
relation
between
them
as
found
by
a
vast
number
of
careful
experiments
is
that
of
to
that
is
one
unit
of
heat
is
equal
to
units
of
work
in
this
and
all
cases
requiring
scientific
precision
it
is
better
to
use
the
units
of
the
metrical
system
than
our
clumsy
english
standards
but
it
may
be
sufficient
for
the
ordinary
reader
to
take
the
metre
which
is
about
inches
as
practically
a
yard
and
the
kilogramme
which
is
english
grains
as
practically
equal
to
lbs
this
is
sufficient
to
show
the
much
greater
energy
of
the
invisible
forces
which
act
at
minute
distances
than
that
of
gravity
and
other
forces
which
do
appreciable
mechanical
work
the
energy
of
a
weight
falling
from
a
height
of
more
than
feet
being
only
sufficient
to
heat
its
own
weight
by
this
proof
of
the
convertibility
of
work
into
heat
gives
much
greater
precision
to
our
ideas
respecting
the
real
nature
of
heat
and
its
kindred
molecular
and
atomic
energies
heat
is
clearly
not
a
material
substance
for
a
body
does
not
gain
weight
by
becoming
hotter
in
the
case
of
all
ponderable
matter
down
to
the
atoms
which
are
only
of
the
size
of
compared
to
that
of
the
earth
any
combination
which
adds
matter
adds
weight
and
the
weight
of
the
product
exactly
equals
the
sum
of
the
weights
of
the
separate
factors
which
have
united
to
form
it
thus
if
iron
is
burnt
in
oxygen
gas
the
product
oxide
of
iron
or
rust
weighs
more
than
the
original
iron
by
just
as
much
as
the
weight
of
the
oxygen
which
has
been
consumed
but
heat
light
and
electricity
add
nothing
to
the
weight
of
a
body
when
they
are
added
to
it
and
take
nothing
away
when
they
are
subtracted
the
inference
is
unavoidable
that
heat
like
light
is
not
ponderable
matter
but
an
energy
transmitted
by
waves
of
the
imponderable
medium
known
as
ether
this
is
confirmed
by
finding
that
when
a
ray
from
the
sun
is
analysed
by
passing
through
a
refracting
prism
one
part
of
the
spectrum
shows
light
of
various
colours
while
another
gives
heat
the
hottest
part
of
the
spectrum
lies
in
the
red
and
beyond
it
showing
that
the
are
longer
and
their
oscillations
slower
than
those
of
light
also
may
be
made
to
interfere
and
to
become
polarised
in
a
manner
analogous
to
the
phenomena
exhibited
by
those
of
light
there
can
be
no
doubt
therefore
that
heat
like
light
is
an
energy
or
mode
of
motion
transmitted
by
waves
of
an
imponderable
ether
and
that
it
acts
on
the
molecules
and
atoms
of
matter
by
the
accumulated
successive
impulses
of
those
waves
on
the
molecules
and
atoms
which
are
floating
in
it
or
rather
which
are
revolving
in
it
in
definite
groups
and
fixed
orbits
like
miniature
solar
systems
or
starry
universes
we
can
now
see
how
heat
performs
work
and
why
work
can
be
transformed
into
it
heat
performs
work
in
two
ways
first
it
expands
is
it
draws
their
molecules
farther
apart
against
the
force
of
cohesion
which
binds
them
together
or
keeps
them
moving
in
definite
orbits
at
definite
distances
it
is
as
if
it
increased
the
velocity
and
therefore
the
centrifugal
force
of
a
system
of
planets
and
so
caused
them
to
revolve
in
wider
orbits
the
expansion
of
mercury
in
a
thermometer
affords
a
familiar
instance
of
this
effect
of
heat
and
the
readiest
measure
of
its
amount
secondly
it
increases
the
energy
of
the
molecular
motions
so
that
they
dart
about
collide
and
vibrate
with
greater
force
thus
as
heat
increases
evaporation
increases
for
molecules
on
the
surface
are
projected
with
so
much
force
as
to
get
beyond
the
sphere
of
the
cohesive
attraction
which
binds
them
to
the
system
and
they
dart
off
like
comets
into
space
finally
as
heat
increases
and
more
and
more
work
is
done
against
the
centripetal
force
of
cohesion
most
substances
and
doubtless
all
if
we
could
get
heat
enough
are
converted
from
solids
into
fluids
and
ultimately
into
gases
in
which
latter
state
the
molecules
have
got
altogether
beyond
the
sphere
of
their
mutual
attraction
and
tend
to
dart
off
indefinitely
in
the
direction
of
their
own
proper
centrifugal
motions
unless
confined
in
which
case
they
dart
about
collide
rebound
and
exercise
pressure
on
the
containing
surface
conversely
if
heat
expands
bodies
it
is
given
out
when
they
contract
thus
the
enormous
quantity
of
heat
poured
out
for
millions
of
years
by
the
sun
is
probably
owing
mainly
to
the
mechanical
force
of
contraction
of
the
original
cosmic
matter
condensing
about
the
solar
nucleus
again
when
gases
suddenly
expand
their
temperature
falls
which
is
the
principle
by
which
artificial
ice
is
procured
and
frozen
beef
and
mutton
are
brought
from
america
and
australia
producing
such
are
the
complicated
relations
of
modern
society
agricultural
depression
fall
of
rents
and
a
serious
aggravation
of
the
irish
question
as
an
example
of
the
converse
proposition
of
the
transformation
of
heat
into
mechanical
work
the
affords
the
aptest
illustration
the
original
power
came
from
the
sun
millions
of
years
ago
and
did
work
by
enabling
the
leaves
of
plants
to
overcome
the
strong
mutual
affinity
of
carbon
and
oxygen
in
the
carbonic
dioxide
in
the
air
and
store
up
the
carbon
in
the
plant
where
it
remained
since
the
coal
era
in
the
form
of
energy
of
position
by
lighting
the
coal
or
in
other
words
separating
its
molecules
more
widely
by
heat
we
enable
them
to
exert
once
more
their
natural
affinity
for
oxygen
and
burn
that
is
recombine
into
carbonic
dioxide
the
heat
thus
produced
turns
water
into
steam
which
passes
through
a
cylinder
either
into
a
condenser
if
the
steam
is
at
low
pressure
or
into
the
outer
air
if
it
has
been
superheated
and
brought
to
a
higher
pressure
than
that
of
the
atmosphere
the
difference
of
the
pressure
or
elasticity
of
the
steam
in
the
boiler
and
of
the
same
steam
when
it
is
condensed
or
liberated
is
available
for
doing
work
and
being
admitted
and
released
alternately
at
the
two
ends
of
the
cylinder
drives
a
piston
up
and
down
which
by
means
of
cranks
and
shafts
turns
a
wheel
or
does
whatever
work
is
required
of
it
in
doing
this
heat
disappears
being
converted
into
work
and
the
amount
of
heat
would
exactly
equal
that
into
which
the
work
would
be
converted
according
to
law
if
it
could
all
be
utilised
without
the
loss
necessarily
incurred
by
friction
radiation
and
the
still
more
important
absorption
of
latent
heat
required
to
convert
water
at
into
vapour
of
the
same
temperature
this
latter
is
not
really
an
annihilation
of
the
heat
but
its
conversion
into
work
done
in
separating
the
molecules
against
the
force
of
cohesion
the
whole
heat
therefore
is
transformed
into
work
mainly
molecular
work
in
tearing
molecules
asunder
and
the
residue
into
mechanical
work
turning
spindles
and
driving
locomotives
and
steamboats
the
intermediate
machinery
here
including
the
water
in
the
boiler
is
merely
the
means
of
applying
the
original
energy
in
the
particular
way
we
desire
the
essential
thing
is
the
transformation
of
a
certain
amount
of
heat
into
work
by
passing
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
heat
from
a
hotter
to
a
colder
body
the
last
condition
is
indispensable
for
the
nature
of
heat
is
to
seek
an
equilibrium
by
passing
from
hot
to
cold
and
no
work
can
be
got
out
of
it
in
the
reverse
way
on
the
contrary
work
must
be
expended
and
turned
into
heat
to
restore
the
temperature
which
has
run
down
the
case
is
analogous
to
that
of
water
which
if
raised
by
evaporation
or
stored
up
in
reservoirs
at
a
level
above
the
sea
can
be
made
to
turn
a
wheel
while
it
is
running
down
but
when
it
has
all
run
down
to
the
sea
level
can
do
no
more
work
and
can
only
be
pumped
up
again
to
a
higher
level
by
the
expenditure
of
fresh
work
owing
to
this
tendency
of
heat
we
can
see
that
although
matter
and
energy
are
to
all
appearance
indestructible
the
present
constitution
of
the
universe
is
not
eternal
the
animating
energy
of
heat
is
always
tending
to
obliterate
differences
of
temperature
and
bring
all
energy
down
to
one
uniform
dead
level
of
a
common
average
in
which
no
further
life
work
or
motion
are
possible
fortunately
this
consummation
is
far
off
and
for
many
tens
or
hundreds
of
millions
of
years
the
inhabitants
of
this
tiny
planet
may
feel
fairly
secure
and
need
not
like
the
late
cumming
of
millenarian
celebrity
introduce
breaks
in
the
leases
of
their
houses
to
provide
against
the
contingency
of
the
world
coming
to
an
end
at
an
early
date
dismissing
then
to
the
remote
future
any
speculations
as
to
the
failure
of
this
essential
element
of
active
energy
let
us
rather
consider
the
various
protean
forms
in
which
it
shows
itself
the
energy
of
visible
motion
which
as
we
have
seen
may
be
transformed
into
an
equivalent
amount
of
energy
of
position
molecular
energy
which
causes
the
cohesive
attraction
repulsion
and
other
proper
motions
of
these
minute
and
invisible
particles
of
matter
energy
of
heat
and
light
which
are
transmitted
by
waves
of
the
assumed
imponderable
medium
called
ether
energy
of
chemical
action
by
which
the
small
ultimate
particles
of
ponderable
matter
called
atoms
separate
and
combine
into
the
various
combinations
of
molecules
constituting
visible
matter
in
obedience
to
certain
affinities
or
inherent
attractions
and
repulsions
electrical
energy
which
includes
magnetism
as
a
special
instance
all
these
forms
of
energy
may
exist
as
in
the
case
of
visible
energy
either
as
energies
of
motion
or
of
position
and
the
actual
constitution
of
the
universe
is
due
in
a
great
measure
to
the
alternation
of
these
two
energies
thus
all
whether
it
be
of
the
waves
of
the
sea
grinding
down
a
rocky
coast
of
the
air
transmitting
sound
or
of
ether
transmitting
light
and
heat
are
instances
of
energies
of
motion
and
of
position
conflicting
with
one
another
and
alternately
gaining
the
victory
so
also
a
pound
of
gunpowder
or
dynamite
has
an
immense
energy
of
position
which
when
its
atoms
are
let
loose
from
their
mutual
unstable
connection
by
heat
or
percussion
manifests
itself
in
an
enormous
energy
of
motion
which
is
more
or
less
destructive
according
to
the
rapidity
with
which
the
atoms
rush
into
new
combinations
let
us
consider
these
different
energies
a
little
more
in
detail
the
energy
of
visible
motion
is
manifested
principally
by
the
law
of
gravity
under
which
all
matter
attracts
other
matter
directly
as
the
mass
and
inversely
as
the
square
of
the
distance
it
is
a
universal
and
uniform
law
of
matter
and
can
be
traced
without
change
or
variation
from
the
minutest
atom
up
to
the
remotest
double
star
the
energy
of
living
force
might
at
first
sight
be
considered
as
another
of
the
commonest
causes
of
visible
motion
but
when
closely
analysed
it
will
be
found
that
what
appears
as
such
is
only
the
result
of
molecular
energy
of
position
stored
up
in
the
living
body
by
chemical
changes
during
the
slow
combustion
of
food
and
that
nothing
has
been
added
by
any
hypothetical
vital
force
the
conscious
will
seems
to
act
in
those
cases
simply
as
the
signalman
who
shows
a
white
flag
may
act
on
a
train
which
has
been
standing
on
the
line
waiting
for
it
the
energy
which
moves
the
train
is
due
entirely
to
the
difference
of
heat
which
has
been
developed
by
the
combustion
of
coal
between
the
steam
in
the
boiler
and
the
steam
when
allowed
to
escape
into
the
air
and
this
energy
came
originally
from
the
sun
whose
rays
enabled
the
leaves
of
growing
plants
to
decompose
carbonic
dioxide
and
store
up
the
carbon
in
the
coal
of
this
force
of
gravity
causing
visible
motion
we
may
say
that
it
is
comparatively
a
very
weak
force
which
acts
uniformly
over
all
distances
great
or
small
molecular
energies
on
the
other
hand
act
with
vastly
greater
force
but
at
very
small
distances
and
appear
sometimes
as
attractive
and
sometimes
as
repulsive
forces
thus
solid
bodies
are
held
together
by
a
force
of
cohesion
which
is
very
powerful
but
acts
only
at
very
small
distances
as
we
may
see
if
we
break
a
piece
of
glass
and
try
to
mend
it
by
pressing
the
broken
edges
together
we
can
not
bring
them
near
enough
to
bring
the
molecular
attraction
again
into
play
and
make
the
broken
glass
solid
but
the
same
glass
acts
with
repellent
energy
if
another
solid
tries
to
penetrate
it
so
that
we
can
walk
on
a
glass
floor
without
sinking
into
it
heat
also
by
increasing
the
distance
between
the
molecules
first
weakens
the
cohesive
force
so
that
the
solid
becomes
fluid
and
finally
overcomes
it
altogether
so
that
it
passes
into
the
state
of
gas
in
which
the
centripetal
attraction
of
the
molecules
is
extinguished
and
they
tend
to
recede
further
and
further
from
each
other
under
the
centrifugal
force
of
their
own
proper
velocities
the
great
energy
of
molecular
forces
will
be
apparent
from
the
fact
that
a
bar
of
iron
in
cooling
centigrade
contracts
with
a
force
equal
to
a
ton
for
each
square
inch
of
section
as
exemplified
in
the
tubular
bridge
across
the
menai
straits
where
space
has
to
be
allowed
for
the
free
contraction
and
expansion
of
the
iron
under
changes
of
temperature
chemical
energy
or
the
mutual
attractions
and
repulsions
of
atoms
is
even
more
powerful
than
that
of
molecules
it
displays
itself
in
their
elective
affinities
or
what
may
be
called
the
likes
and
dislikes
or
loves
and
hatreds
of
these
ultimate
particles
perhaps
the
best
illustration
will
be
afforded
by
that
resource
of
civilisation
dynamite
this
substance
or
to
give
it
its
scientific
name
is
composed
of
molecules
each
of
which
is
a
complex
combination
of
nine
atoms
of
oxygen
five
of
hydrogen
three
of
nitrogen
and
three
of
carbon
of
these
oxygen
and
hydrogen
have
a
strong
affinity
for
one
another
as
is
seen
by
their
rushing
together
whenever
they
get
the
chance
and
by
their
union
forming
the
very
stable
compound
water
oxygen
and
carbon
have
also
a
very
strong
affinity
and
readily
form
the
stable
product
carbonic
dioxide
gas
nitrogen
on
the
other
hand
is
a
very
inert
substance
its
molecule
consists
of
two
atoms
of
itself
which
are
bound
together
by
a
strong
affinity
and
can
only
be
coaxed
with
difficulty
into
combinations
with
other
elements
forming
compounds
which
are
as
it
were
artificial
structures
and
very
unstable
we
see
this
in
the
air
which
consists
mainly
of
oxygen
and
nitrogen
but
not
in
chemical
combination
the
oxygen
being
simply
diluted
by
the
nitrogen
as
whisky
is
with
water
with
the
same
object
of
diluting
the
too
powerful
oxygen
or
too
potent
alcohol
and
enabling
the
or
to
take
them
into
the
system
without
burning
up
the
tissues
too
rapidly
if
nitrogen
had
more
affinity
for
oxygen
it
would
combine
chemically
with
it
and
we
should
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
nitrous
oxide
or
laughing
gas
the
molecule
therefore
of
resembles
a
house
of
cards
so
nicely
balanced
that
it
will
just
stand
but
will
fall
to
pieces
at
the
slightest
touch
when
this
is
supplied
by
a
slight
percussion
the
molecule
falls
to
pieces
and
is
resolved
into
its
constituent
atoms
which
rush
together
in
accordance
with
their
natural
affinities
forming
an
immense
volume
of
gas
partly
of
water
in
the
form
of
steam
where
oxygen
has
combined
with
hydrogen
and
partly
of
carbonic
dioxide
where
it
has
combined
with
carbon
leaving
the
nitrogen
atoms
to
pair
off
and
revert
to
their
original
form
of
molecules
of
nitrogen
gas
it
is
as
if
couples
who
had
been
united
by
matrimonial
bonds
tied
by
the
man≈ìuvres
of
belgravian
mothers
found
themselves
suddenly
freed
by
a
decree
of
divorce
vinculo
and
rushed
impetuously
into
each
arms
according
to
the
laws
of
their
respective
affinities
so
striking
is
the
similitude
that
one
of
novels
the
takes
its
title
from
the
human
play
of
these
chemical
reactions
the
enormous
energy
developed
when
these
atomic
forces
are
let
loose
and
a
vast
volume
of
gas
almost
instantaneously
created
is
attested
by
the
destructive
force
by
which
the
hardest
rocks
are
shattered
to
pieces
and
the
strongest
buildings
overthrown
these
loves
and
hatreds
or
as
they
are
termed
chemical
affinities
and
repulsions
of
the
atoms
are
the
principal
means
by
which
the
material
structure
of
the
universe
is
built
up
from
the
original
elements
the
earth
or
solid
crust
of
the
planet
we
inhabit
consists
mainly
of
oxidised
bases
and
is
due
to
the
affinity
of
oxygen
for
silicon
calcium
aluminium
iron
and
other
primary
elements
of
what
are
called
metals
this
affinity
enables
them
to
make
stable
compounds
which
under
the
existing
conditions
of
temperature
and
otherwise
hold
together
and
are
not
readily
decomposed
water
in
like
manner
in
all
its
forms
of
waves
seas
lakes
rivers
clouds
and
invisible
vapour
is
due
to
the
affinity
between
oxygen
and
hydrogen
forming
a
stable
compound
salt
again
is
owing
to
the
affinity
of
chlorine
for
sodium
and
so
for
nearly
all
the
various
products
with
which
we
are
familiar
oxygen
and
nitrogen
in
the
air
we
breathe
being
almost
the
only
elements
which
exist
in
their
primary
and
uncombined
state
in
any
considerable
quantities
and
form
an
essential
part
of
the
conditions
which
render
our
planet
a
habitable
abode
for
man
and
other
forms
of
life
we
shall
see
presently
something
more
of
the
nature
of
these
affinities
and
the
laws
by
which
they
act
but
before
entering
on
this
branch
of
the
subject
we
must
consider
the
remaining
form
in
which
the
one
indestructible
energy
of
the
universe
manifests
itself
viz
that
of
electricity
electricity
is
the
most
subtle
and
the
least
understood
of
these
forms
in
its
simplest
form
it
appears
as
the
result
of
friction
between
dissimilar
substances
thus
if
we
rub
a
glass
rod
with
a
piece
of
silk
taking
care
that
both
are
warm
and
dry
we
find
that
the
glass
has
acquired
the
property
of
attracting
light
bodies
such
as
little
bits
of
paper
or
balls
of
other
substances
such
as
and
amber
have
the
same
property
pursuing
our
research
further
we
find
that
this
influence
is
not
like
that
of
gravity
uniform
and
always
acting
in
the
same
direction
but
of
two
kinds
equal
and
opposite
if
we
touch
the
by
the
excited
glass
rod
it
will
after
contact
be
repelled
but
if
we
bring
the
ball
which
has
been
excited
by
contact
with
the
glass
within
the
influence
of
a
stick
of
which
has
been
excited
by
rubbing
it
with
warm
dry
flannel
the
ball
instead
of
being
repelled
is
attracted
conversely
if
the
has
been
first
touched
by
excited
it
will
afterwards
be
repelled
by
excited
and
attracted
by
excited
glass
it
is
clear
therefore
that
there
are
two
opposite
electricities
and
that
bodies
charged
with
similar
electricities
repel
and
with
unlike
electricities
attract
one
another
for
convenience
one
of
these
electricities
that
developed
in
glass
is
called
positive
and
the
other
negative
and
it
has
been
clearly
proved
that
one
can
not
exist
without
the
other
and
that
whenever
one
electricity
is
produced
just
as
much
is
produced
of
an
opposite
description
if
positive
electricity
is
produced
in
glass
by
rubbing
it
with
silk
just
as
much
negative
electricity
is
produced
upon
the
silk
another
primary
fact
is
that
some
substances
are
able
to
carry
away
and
diffuse
or
neutralise
this
peculiar
influence
called
electricity
while
others
are
unable
to
do
so
and
retain
it
the
former
are
called
conductors
the
latter
thus
glass
is
an
insulator
or
while
metal
is
a
conductor
of
electricity
and
the
reason
why
the
substances
rubbed
together
as
glass
and
silk
must
be
dry
is
that
water
in
all
its
forms
is
a
conductor
which
carries
away
the
electricity
as
fast
as
it
is
produced
these
facts
have
given
rise
to
a
is
after
all
not
so
much
an
explanation
as
a
convenient
mode
of
expressing
the
the
existence
of
two
opposite
electric
fluids
which
in
the
ordinary
or
unexcited
body
are
combined
and
neutralise
one
another
but
are
separated
by
friction
and
flow
in
opposite
directions
accumulating
at
opposite
poles
or
it
may
be
one
being
accumulated
at
one
pole
while
the
other
is
diffused
through
some
conducting
medium
and
lost
sight
of
the
active
electricity
be
it
positive
or
negative
thus
accumulated
at
one
pole
and
retained
there
by
the
substance
in
contact
with
it
being
a
disturbs
by
its
influence
the
electrical
equilibrium
of
any
body
brought
near
to
it
separates
its
two
fluids
and
attracts
the
one
opposite
to
itself
this
attraction
draws
the
light
body
towards
it
until
contact
ensues
when
the
electric
fluid
of
the
excited
body
flows
into
the
smaller
one
so
that
its
opposite
electricity
is
expelled
and
it
is
in
the
same
condition
as
its
exciter
and
therefore
liable
to
be
repelled
by
a
similar
exciter
or
attracted
by
an
opposite
one
which
formerly
repelled
it
it
is
evident
without
going
further
that
there
is
a
great
analogy
between
electrical
energy
and
those
of
heat
and
of
chemical
affinity
the
same
mechanical
generates
heat
generates
electricity
the
chief
difference
seems
to
be
that
friction
may
be
transformed
into
heat
when
the
same
substances
are
rubbed
together
as
in
the
case
of
obtaining
fire
by
the
friction
of
wood
but
electricity
can
only
be
obtained
by
friction
between
dissimilar
substances
thus
no
electricity
is
obtained
by
rubbing
glass
upon
glass
or
silk
upon
silk
or
upon
glass
covered
with
silk
though
a
slight
difference
of
texture
is
sometimes
sufficient
to
separate
the
electric
fluids
thus
if
two
pieces
of
the
same
silk
ribbon
are
rubbed
together
lengthways
no
electricity
is
produced
but
if
crossways
one
is
positively
and
the
other
negatively
electrified
in
this
respect
the
analogy
is
evident
to
chemical
affinity
which
in
like
manner
only
acts
between
dissimilar
bodies
in
order
however
to
carry
the
proof
of
the
identity
of
these
forms
of
energy
beyond
the
sphere
of
vague
analogy
we
must
follow
up
electricity
far
beyond
the
simple
manifestations
of
the
glass
rod
and
and
pursue
it
to
its
origin
in
the
transformations
of
chemical
action
and
mechanical
work
in
the
voltaic
battery
the
electric
telegraph
the
telephone
and
the
dynamo
the
voltaic
battery
in
its
simplest
form
is
a
trough
containing
an
acid
liquid
in
which
pairs
of
plates
of
different
metals
are
immersed
it
is
evident
that
if
the
action
of
the
acid
on
each
metal
were
precisely
the
same
equal
quantities
of
each
would
be
dissolved
in
the
acid
and
the
equilibrium
of
chemical
energies
would
not
be
affected
but
the
action
being
different
this
equilibrium
is
disturbed
and
if
the
sum
of
these
disturbances
for
a
number
of
separate
pairs
of
plates
can
be
accumulated
it
will
become
considerable
this
is
done
by
connecting
the
plates
of
the
same
metal
in
each
cell
by
a
metallic
wire
covered
by
some
substance
there
are
therefore
two
wires
one
to
the
right
hand
the
other
to
the
left
the
loose
extremities
of
which
are
called
the
poles
of
the
battery
if
we
test
these
poles
as
we
did
the
glass
rod
and
stick
of
we
find
that
one
pole
is
charged
with
positive
and
the
other
with
negative
electricity
in
other
words
the
chemical
energy
whose
equilibrium
was
disturbed
by
the
unequal
action
of
the
acid
on
the
plates
of
different
metals
has
been
transformed
into
electrical
energy
manifesting
itself
as
it
always
does
under
the
condition
of
two
equal
and
opposite
polarities
if
we
connect
these
two
poles
with
one
another
the
two
electricities
rush
together
and
unite
and
there
is
established
what
is
called
an
electrical
current
circulating
round
the
battery
as
the
chemical
action
of
the
acid
on
the
metals
is
not
momentary
but
continuous
the
acid
taking
up
molecule
after
molecule
of
the
metal
so
also
the
current
is
continuous
when
we
call
it
a
current
the
term
is
used
for
the
sake
of
convenience
for
as
the
current
as
we
shall
presently
see
will
flow
along
the
wire
or
other
conducting
substance
for
immense
distances
as
across
the
atlantic
with
a
velocity
of
many
thousands
of
miles
per
second
we
can
no
more
than
in
the
case
of
light
figure
it
to
ourselves
as
an
actual
transfer
of
material
particles
swept
along
as
by
a
river
running
with
this
enormous
velocity
but
necessarily
as
a
transmission
of
some
form
of
motion
travelling
by
waves
or
tremors
through
the
ether
in
which
the
atoms
of
the
conducting
wire
are
floating
be
this
as
it
may
the
effect
of
these
electric
currents
is
very
varied
and
very
energetic
it
can
produce
intense
heat
for
if
instead
of
uniting
the
two
poles
we
connect
them
by
a
thin
platinum
wire
it
will
in
a
few
seconds
become
heated
to
redness
if
the
connecting
wire
is
thicker
heat
will
equally
be
generated
but
less
intense
thus
maintaining
the
analogy
to
the
current
which
rushes
with
more
impetuosity
through
a
narrow
than
through
a
wide
channel
if
the
poles
are
tipped
with
a
solid
substance
like
carbon
whose
particles
remain
solid
under
great
heat
when
they
are
brought
nearly
together
intense
light
is
produced
and
the
carbon
slowly
burns
away
this
produces
what
is
called
the
arc
light
which
gives
such
a
strong
illuminating
power
and
is
coming
into
general
use
for
lighting
up
large
spaces
another
transformation
is
back
again
into
chemical
energy
which
is
shown
by
the
power
of
the
electric
current
to
decompose
compound
substances
if
for
instance
the
poles
of
a
battery
are
plunged
into
a
vessel
containing
water
the
molecules
of
the
water
will
be
decomposed
and
bubbles
of
oxygen
gas
will
rise
from
the
positive
and
of
hydrogen
from
the
negative
pole
another
effect
of
electrical
currents
is
that
of
attraction
and
repulsion
on
one
another
if
two
parallel
wires
free
to
move
carry
currents
flowing
in
the
same
direction
as
from
positive
to
negative
or
they
will
attract
one
another
if
in
opposite
directions
they
will
repel
electrical
currents
also
work
by
way
of
induction
that
is
they
disturb
the
electrical
equilibrium
of
bodies
brought
within
their
influence
and
induce
currents
in
them
thus
if
we
have
two
circular
coils
of
insulated
wire
placed
near
each
other
one
on
the
right
hand
the
other
on
the
left
and
connect
the
extremities
of
the
coil
with
the
poles
of
a
battery
when
the
connection
is
first
made
and
the
current
begins
to
flow
a
momentary
current
in
the
opposite
direction
will
pass
through
the
coil
this
will
cease
and
as
long
as
the
current
continues
to
flow
through
the
coil
there
will
be
no
current
through
the
other
but
if
we
break
the
contact
between
the
coil
and
the
battery
there
will
be
again
a
momentary
current
through
the
coil
but
this
time
in
the
same
direction
as
the
other
the
same
effect
will
be
produced
if
instead
of
making
and
breaking
contact
in
the
coil
we
keep
the
current
constantly
flowing
through
it
and
make
the
coil
alternately
approach
and
recede
from
the
other
coil
in
this
case
when
the
coil
approaches
it
induces
an
opposite
current
in
the
one
and
when
it
recedes
one
in
the
same
direction
as
that
of
the
primary
these
phenomena
of
induction
prepare
us
to
understand
the
nature
of
magnets
and
the
magnetic
effects
produced
by
electrical
currents
if
an
insulated
wire
is
wrapped
round
a
cylinder
of
soft
or
unmagnetic
iron
and
a
current
passed
through
the
wire
the
cylinder
is
converted
into
a
magnet
and
becomes
able
to
sustain
weights
if
the
current
ceases
the
cylinder
is
no
longer
a
magnet
and
drops
the
weight
a
magnet
is
therefore
evidently
a
substance
in
which
electric
currents
are
circulating
at
right
angles
to
its
axis
and
a
permanent
magnet
is
one
in
which
such
currents
permanently
circulate
from
the
constitution
of
the
body
without
being
supplied
from
without
the
earth
is
such
a
magnet
and
also
iron
and
other
substances
under
certain
conditions
this
being
established
it
is
easy
to
see
why
an
electrical
current
deflects
the
magnetic
needle
if
such
a
needle
is
suspended
freely
near
a
wire
parallel
with
it
on
a
current
being
passed
through
the
wire
it
must
attract
if
similar
or
repel
if
dissimilar
the
currents
which
are
circulating
at
right
angles
to
the
axis
of
the
needle
and
thus
tend
to
make
the
needle
swing
into
a
position
at
right
angles
with
the
wire
so
that
its
currents
may
be
parallel
to
that
of
the
needle
this
is
the
reason
why
the
needle
in
its
ordinary
condition
points
to
the
north
and
south
or
rather
to
the
magnetic
poles
of
the
earth
because
its
currents
are
influenced
by
the
earth
currents
which
circulate
parallel
to
the
magnetic
equator
the
deviation
of
the
needle
from
this
direction
caused
by
any
other
current
like
that
passed
along
the
wire
will
depend
on
the
strength
of
the
current
which
may
be
measured
by
the
amount
of
deflection
of
the
needle
the
direction
in
which
the
needle
deflects
viz
whether
the
north
pole
swings
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
will
depend
on
the
direction
of
the
current
through
the
wire
the
direction
of
the
circular
currents
which
form
a
magnet
is
such
that
if
you
look
towards
the
north
pole
of
a
freely
suspended
cylindrical
if
you
stand
on
the
north
of
it
and
look
positive
current
will
ascend
on
your
right
hand
or
on
the
west
side
and
descend
on
the
east
it
follows
that
unlike
poles
must
necessarily
attract
and
like
poles
repel
one
another
for
in
the
former
case
the
circular
currents
which
face
each
other
are
going
in
the
same
and
in
the
latter
in
opposite
directions
the
reader
is
now
in
a
position
to
understand
the
principle
of
the
electric
telegraph
that
wonderful
invention
which
has
revolutionised
human
intercourse
and
to
a
great
extent
annihilated
space
and
time
it
originated
in
the
discovery
made
by
oersted
a
danish
that
the
effect
of
an
electric
current
was
to
make
a
magnet
swing
round
in
the
endeavour
to
place
itself
at
right
angles
to
it
the
conducting
power
of
insulated
copper
wire
is
such
that
it
practically
makes
no
difference
whether
one
of
the
wires
connected
with
the
pole
of
a
battery
is
two
feet
or
miles
in
length
and
the
earth
being
a
conducting
medium
supplies
an
equal
extension
from
the
other
pole
so
that
a
closed
electric
circuit
may
be
established
across
the
atlantic
as
easily
as
within
the
walls
of
a
laboratory
if
therefore
a
magnetic
needle
is
suspended
at
the
american
end
it
will
respond
to
every
electrical
current
and
to
any
interruption
renewal
or
reversal
of
that
current
established
in
england
the
needle
may
thus
be
made
to
swing
to
the
right
or
left
by
forming
or
reversing
a
current
through
the
wire
and
it
will
return
to
its
position
whenever
the
current
is
interrupted
and
repeat
its
movement
whenever
the
current
is
renewed
in
fact
it
may
be
made
to
move
like
the
arm
of
the
telegraph
or
of
a
railway
signal
it
only
remains
to
have
a
machine
by
which
the
operator
can
form
and
interrupt
currents
rapidly
and
a
code
by
which
certain
movements
of
the
needle
stand
for
certain
letters
of
the
alphabet
and
you
have
the
electric
telegraph
there
are
many
ingenious
applications
of
the
machinery
but
in
principle
they
all
resolve
themselves
into
transformations
of
energy
chemical
energy
is
transformed
into
electric
energy
and
that
again
into
mechanical
work
in
moving
the
needle
the
telephone
is
another
instance
of
similar
transformations
here
spoken
words
create
vibrations
of
the
air
which
cause
corresponding
vibrations
in
a
thin
plate
or
disc
of
metal
at
one
end
which
are
conveyed
by
intermediate
machinery
to
a
similar
disc
at
the
other
end
whose
vibrations
cause
similar
vibrations
in
the
air
reproducing
the
spoken
words
at
a
distance
which
may
be
a
great
many
miles
from
the
speaker
the
great
inventions
of
modern
science
which
have
so
revolutionised
society
are
all
instances
of
the
laws
of
the
conservation
of
energy
man
makes
the
powers
of
nature
available
for
his
purposes
by
transforming
them
backwards
and
forwards
now
into
one
now
into
another
form
of
energy
as
required
for
the
result
he
wishes
to
attain
he
wants
mechanical
power
to
pump
water
or
drive
a
locomotive
or
steamboat
he
gets
it
from
the
by
transforming
the
energy
of
heat
in
coal
which
came
ages
ago
from
the
energy
of
chemical
action
produced
by
the
rays
in
the
green
leaves
of
growing
plants
he
wants
to
send
messages
in
a
few
seconds
across
the
atlantic
he
does
it
by
transforming
chemical
energy
into
electricity
in
a
voltaic
battery
sending
its
vibrations
along
a
conducting
wire
and
converting
it
at
the
far
end
into
mechanical
power
making
a
magnetic
needle
turn
on
its
axis
and
give
signals
if
instead
of
sending
a
message
he
wants
to
hold
a
conversation
at
a
distance
he
invents
the
telephone
by
which
of
air
are
transformed
into
vibrations
of
a
disc
then
into
electric
currents
then
into
vibrations
of
a
distant
disc
and
finally
back
again
to
spoken
words
or
if
he
wants
light
he
turns
electricity
into
it
by
tipping
the
poles
of
his
battery
with
carbon
and
bringing
them
close
together
the
latest
inventions
of
electrical
dynamo
and
the
remarkable
instances
of
this
convertibility
of
one
primitive
energy
into
different
forms
in
the
instance
just
quoted
of
obtaining
light
from
electricity
by
the
voltaic
battery
the
cost
has
hitherto
proved
an
obstacle
to
its
adoption
the
electrical
energy
is
all
obtained
from
the
transformation
of
the
heat
produced
in
the
cells
by
the
chemical
action
on
the
metal
used
which
is
commonly
zinc
now
the
heat
of
combination
of
zinc
with
oxygen
is
only
about
of
that
of
coal
while
the
cost
of
zinc
is
about
twenty
times
as
great
theoretically
therefore
energy
got
by
burning
zinc
costs
times
as
much
as
that
got
by
burning
coal
practically
the
difference
is
not
nearly
so
great
for
there
is
very
little
loss
of
energy
in
the
battery
by
the
process
of
conversion
while
the
best
can
not
convert
into
work
as
much
as
twenty
per
cent
of
the
heat
energy
in
the
coal
consumed
still
after
making
every
allowance
the
cost
of
energy
from
zinc
remains
some
twenty
times
as
great
as
from
coal
so
that
unless
some
process
is
found
for
obtaining
back
the
zinc
as
a
residual
product
there
is
no
prospect
of
this
form
of
electricity
being
generally
available
for
light
or
for
mechanical
power
the
dynamo
is
an
instrument
invented
for
the
mechanical
generation
of
electricity
by
taking
advantage
of
the
principle
that
electrical
energy
is
produced
by
moving
magnets
near
coils
of
wire
or
coils
of
wire
near
magnets
a
current
is
thus
started
by
induction
and
once
started
the
mechanical
power
exerted
in
making
the
magnet
or
coils
revolve
is
continually
converted
into
electricity
until
the
accumulated
electrical
energy
becomes
very
powerful
the
original
energy
comes
of
course
from
the
coal
burned
in
the
which
makes
the
magnet
or
coils
revolve
the
principle
of
the
conservation
of
energy
is
well
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
as
the
dynamo
generates
an
electric
current
if
made
to
revolve
conversely
it
may
be
made
to
revolve
itself
if
an
electric
current
is
sent
through
it
from
an
exterior
source
it
is
therefore
available
not
only
as
a
source
of
light
in
the
former
case
but
as
a
direct
source
of
mechanical
power
in
the
latter
it
is
on
this
principle
that
electric
engines
are
constructed
and
electric
railways
are
worked
here
also
it
is
a
question
of
cost
and
convenience
for
you
can
only
get
electricity
enough
either
to
light
a
street
or
to
drive
an
engine
by
an
original
or
other
motive
power
to
work
the
dynamo
and
a
system
of
conducting
wires
to
convey
the
electricity
to
the
place
where
the
light
or
power
is
wanted
where
the
motive
power
is
supplied
by
nature
as
in
the
case
of
tidal
or
river
currents
or
waterfalls
it
is
quite
possible
that
power
may
be
obtained
in
this
way
to
compete
with
that
obtained
directly
from
the
but
there
are
as
yet
considerable
practical
difficulties
to
be
overcome
in
the
transmission
of
any
large
amount
of
energy
for
long
distances
to
overcome
some
of
these
difficulties
the
accumulator
has
been
invented
which
affords
yet
another
remarkable
instance
of
the
transformation
of
energy
it
consists
of
two
lead
plates
immersed
in
acidulated
water
when
a
strong
electrical
current
is
sent
through
the
water
it
decomposes
it
the
oxygen
going
to
one
lead
plate
and
the
hydrogen
to
the
other
the
oxygen
attacks
the
lead
plate
to
which
it
goes
forming
peroxide
of
lead
while
the
hydrogen
reduces
any
oxide
in
the
other
plate
producing
pure
lead
and
leaving
a
film
of
surplus
hydrogen
on
the
surface
the
charging
current
is
then
reversed
so
that
the
latter
plate
is
now
attacked
and
the
former
one
reduced
when
the
current
is
again
reversed
by
continuing
this
process
the
surfaces
of
both
lead
plates
become
porous
so
that
they
present
a
large
surface
and
can
therefore
hold
a
great
deal
of
peroxide
of
lead
the
charging
current
being
now
broken
the
oxygen
which
has
been
forcibly
separated
from
the
liquid
seeks
to
recombine
with
hydrogen
and
if
the
two
lead
plates
are
joined
by
a
wire
this
effort
of
the
oxygen
generates
an
electrical
current
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
original
one
which
is
the
current
utilised
electricity
is
thus
stored
up
in
a
portable
box
where
it
can
be
kept
till
wanted
when
it
is
drawn
out
by
connecting
the
plates
and
as
a
large
amount
of
energy
has
been
accumulated
the
current
which
is
produced
lasts
for
a
considerable
time
unfortunately
accumulators
are
bulky
heavy
and
expensive
and
nearly
half
the
energy
of
the
original
charging
current
is
lost
in
obtaining
the
reversed
or
working
current
they
are
therefore
not
as
yet
adapted
for
general
use
though
perfectly
capable
of
supplying
either
light
or
motive
power
for
both
which
purposes
they
have
been
successfully
applied
in
special
cases
the
future
both
of
electric
power
and
electric
lighting
is
now
reduced
entirely
to
a
question
of
cost
and
though
it
is
hard
to
beat
gas
and
the
with
cheap
coal
and
air
and
water
for
nothing
it
is
possible
that
by
using
natural
sources
of
power
to
move
dynamos
and
by
obtaining
zinc
back
as
a
residual
product
in
batteries
electricity
may
in
certain
cases
carry
the
day
chapter
polarity
in
matter
ultimate
elements
of
up
by
with
and
of
matter
built
up
by
polar
forces
i
almost
fear
that
by
this
time
some
of
my
readers
may
think
that
i
have
seduced
them
under
false
pretences
to
read
long
chapters
of
dry
science
when
they
had
been
led
from
the
introduction
to
anticipate
discussions
on
the
more
immediately
interesting
topics
of
morals
religions
and
philosophies
my
excuse
must
be
that
these
scientific
subjects
are
really
of
extreme
interest
in
themselves
and
indispensable
as
a
solid
basis
for
the
superstructure
to
be
raised
on
them
how
can
i
attempt
to
show
that
the
law
of
polarity
extends
to
the
more
complex
problems
of
human
thought
and
life
if
i
fail
in
establishing
its
application
to
the
simpler
case
of
inorganic
force
and
matter
it
must
be
recollected
also
that
among
the
primitive
polarities
is
that
of
author
and
reader
it
is
my
part
to
endeavour
to
present
the
leading
facts
and
laws
of
the
material
universe
in
such
plain
and
popular
language
that
the
ordinary
reader
who
has
neither
time
nor
faculty
for
special
studies
may
apprehend
them
clearly
without
excessive
effort
or
extraordinary
intelligence
but
it
is
the
part
to
supply
a
fair
average
amount
of
attention
and
above
all
to
feel
an
interest
in
interesting
matters
cleverness
and
curiosity
are
very
much
convertible
terms
and
the
clearest
exposition
is
thrown
away
on
the
torpid
mind
which
views
the
marvellous
universe
in
which
he
has
the
privilege
to
live
with
the
stupid
apathy
of
the
savage
taking
things
as
they
come
without
caring
to
know
anything
about
them
for
the
part
of
the
work
i
am
not
responsible
but
for
my
own
i
am
and
i
proceed
therefore
to
give
in
my
own
way
and
with
the
best
faculty
that
is
in
me
a
clear
summary
of
such
of
the
fundamental
facts
and
laws
of
nature
as
seem
necessary
for
the
work
i
have
undertaken
from
the
preceding
chapters
we
are
now
able
to
realise
what
are
the
ultimate
elements
of
the
material
universe
and
it
remains
to
show
how
they
are
put
together
the
elements
are
ether
energy
and
matter
first
ether
a
universal
medium
imponderable
or
infinitely
light
and
almost
infinitely
elastic
in
which
all
matter
from
suns
and
planets
down
to
molecules
and
atoms
float
as
in
a
boundless
ocean
and
whose
tremors
or
vibrations
propagated
as
waves
transport
the
different
forms
of
energy
light
heat
and
electricity
across
space
secondly
energy
a
primitive
indestructible
something
which
causes
motion
and
manifests
itself
under
its
many
diversified
forms
such
as
gravity
mechanical
work
molecular
and
atomic
forces
light
heat
electricity
and
magnetism
all
of
which
are
merely
protean
transformations
of
the
one
fundamental
energy
and
convertible
into
each
other
thirdly
matter
the
ultimate
elements
of
this
are
atoms
which
combined
form
molecules
or
little
pieces
of
ordinary
matter
with
all
its
qualities
which
are
the
bricks
used
in
building
all
the
varied
structures
of
the
organic
and
inorganic
worlds
of
these
atoms
some
seventy
have
never
yet
been
divided
and
therefore
although
we
may
suspect
that
they
are
merely
combinations
or
transformations
of
one
original
matter
we
must
be
content
for
the
present
to
consider
them
as
elementary
in
like
manner
we
may
suspect
that
matter
is
in
reality
only
another
form
of
energy
and
that
the
impression
of
solidity
is
given
by
the
action
of
a
repellent
force
which
is
very
energetic
at
short
distances
if
this
were
established
we
might
look
forward
to
the
generalisation
that
energy
was
the
one
reality
of
nature
but
for
the
present
it
is
a
mere
speculation
and
we
must
be
content
with
over
seventy
elementary
atoms
as
ultimate
facts
in
any
case
this
much
is
certain
that
matter
like
energy
is
indestructible
we
have
absolutely
no
experience
of
either
of
them
being
created
or
annihilated
nay
more
we
have
no
faculties
to
enable
us
even
to
conceive
how
something
can
be
made
out
of
nothing
and
all
we
know
or
can
ever
know
about
these
primitive
constituents
of
the
universe
is
of
their
laws
of
existence
their
evolutions
and
their
transformations
minute
as
the
atoms
and
molecules
are
we
must
conceive
of
them
not
as
stationary
and
indissolubly
connected
but
rather
as
little
solar
systems
in
which
revolving
atoms
form
the
molecule
and
revolving
molecules
form
the
matter
held
together
as
separate
systems
by
their
proper
energies
and
motions
until
some
superior
force
intruding
breaks
up
the
system
and
sets
its
components
free
to
form
new
combinations
what
is
the
principle
which
thus
forms
and
the
various
combinations
of
atomic
and
molecular
systems
by
which
the
world
is
built
up
from
its
constituent
elements
it
is
polarity
as
i
began
with
the
illustration
of
the
magnet
introducing
order
and
harmony
into
the
confused
mass
of
iron
filings
let
me
take
this
other
illustration
from
the
same
source
if
we
place
an
iron
bar
in
contact
with
the
pole
of
a
magnet
the
bar
becomes
itself
a
magnet
with
opposite
poles
to
the
original
one
so
that
as
opposite
poles
attract
the
iron
bar
adheres
to
it
bring
a
lump
of
nickel
in
contact
with
the
further
end
or
free
pole
of
the
iron
bar
and
the
nickel
also
will
be
magnetised
and
adhere
let
the
lump
of
nickel
be
as
large
as
the
pole
of
the
iron
bar
is
able
to
support
and
now
bring
a
lump
of
soft
iron
near
this
pole
it
will
drop
the
nickel
and
take
the
iron
this
is
exactly
similar
to
those
cases
of
chemical
affinity
in
which
a
molecule
drops
one
of
its
factors
and
takes
on
another
to
which
its
attraction
is
stronger
if
iron
rusts
in
water
it
is
because
the
oxygen
atom
drops
hydrogen
to
take
iron
just
as
the
magnet
dropped
nickel
the
polarity
of
chemical
elements
is
attested
by
the
fact
that
when
compounds
are
decomposed
by
the
electric
current
the
different
elementary
substances
appear
at
different
poles
of
the
battery
thus
oxygen
chlorine
and
substances
appear
at
the
positive
pole
while
hydrogen
potassium
and
metals
generally
appear
at
the
negative
one
the
inference
is
irresistible
that
the
atoms
had
in
each
case
an
opposite
polarity
to
that
of
the
poles
to
which
they
were
attracted
this
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
the
radicals
the
elementary
atoms
or
groups
of
atoms
which
have
opposite
polarities
combine
readily
while
those
which
have
the
same
polarity
as
two
metals
have
but
slight
affinity
for
each
other
like
therefore
attracts
unlike
as
in
all
cases
of
polarity
and
the
greater
the
degree
of
unlikeness
the
stronger
is
the
attraction
thus
the
radicals
of
all
alkalies
are
and
appear
at
the
negative
pole
of
a
battery
while
those
of
acids
are
all
and
the
higher
each
stands
in
its
respective
scale
of
polarity
the
more
strongly
does
it
show
the
peculiar
qualities
of
acid
or
alkali
and
the
more
eagerly
does
it
combine
with
its
opposite
acids
and
alkalies
are
in
fact
all
members
of
the
same
class
of
compounds
called
because
a
single
atom
of
hydrogen
is
a
common
feature
in
their
composition
this
atom
is
coupled
with
a
single
atom
of
oxygen
which
may
be
conceived
of
as
the
central
magnet
holding
the
hydrogen
atom
at
one
pole
while
at
the
other
it
holds
either
a
single
atom
of
some
metallic
element
such
as
potassium
or
sodium
or
a
group
consisting
of
such
an
element
together
with
atoms
of
oxygen
so
constituted
as
to
present
a
single
pole
to
the
attraction
of
the
central
oxygen
atom
thus
if
k
stands
for
kali
or
potassium
n
for
nitrogen
o
for
oxygen
and
h
for
hydrogen
we
may
have
the
compounds
and
o
n
o
the
former
is
the
molecule
of
potassic
hydrate
which
is
the
most
caustic
or
strongest
of
alkalies
the
latter
that
of
nitric
acid
the
most
corrosive
or
powerful
of
acids
these
are
the
extremes
of
the
series
of
which
there
are
many
intermediate
members
all
being
more
or
less
alkaline
that
is
caustic
and
turning
blue
when
the
third
element
is
a
simple
metallic
atom
and
acid
corrosive
and
turning
red
when
it
is
a
compound
radical
of
a
group
of
metallic
and
oxygen
atoms
this
shows
to
what
an
extent
whole
classes
of
substances
may
have
a
general
resemblance
in
their
constitution
and
yet
differ
most
widely
in
their
qualities
by
the
substitution
of
one
element
for
another
these
special
qualities
may
be
made
to
diminish
and
finally
disappear
by
mixing
the
two
opposite
substances
or
as
it
is
called
neutralising
an
acid
by
an
alkali
or
an
alkali
by
an
acid
thus
if
hydrochloric
acid
hcl
be
poured
into
a
solution
of
the
alkaline
qualities
of
the
latter
diminish
and
finally
disappear
the
result
of
the
neutral
solution
being
water
and
or
common
salt
it
is
evident
that
this
result
has
been
produced
by
the
hydrogen
atom
in
and
the
sodium
atom
in
changing
places
the
former
preferring
to
unite
with
oxygen
to
form
water
while
the
displaced
sodium
atom
finds
a
refuge
with
chlorine
the
oxygen
atom
has
dropped
sodium
and
taken
hydrogen
just
as
the
magnet
dropped
nickel
and
took
iron
this
polarity
of
chemical
elements
manifests
itself
in
different
ways
in
some
cases
it
appears
like
that
of
a
magnet
in
which
there
are
two
opposite
poles
and
two
only
one
at
each
end
thus
oxygen
o
is
bipolar
and
its
atom
holds
together
two
atoms
of
hydrogen
h
in
forming
the
molecule
of
water
which
may
be
represented
as
which
is
equivalent
to
illustration
others
again
like
hydrogen
and
chlorine
seem
to
have
only
a
single
pole
as
in
the
case
of
electricity
in
an
excited
glass
rod
and
have
to
create
for
themselves
the
opposite
pole
which
is
the
indispensable
condition
of
all
polarity
by
induction
in
another
body
thus
muriatic
or
hydrochloric
acid
is
formed
by
the
union
of
a
single
atom
of
chlorine
which
is
strongly
negative
with
a
single
atom
of
hydrogen
in
which
it
appears
to
have
induced
a
positive
pole
though
the
combination
is
not
a
very
stable
one
for
if
an
element
with
a
stronger
positive
pole
of
its
own
is
presented
to
the
chlorine
it
drops
the
hydrogen
just
as
the
magnet
drops
the
nickel
other
atoms
are
multipolar
and
seem
as
if
made
up
of
more
than
one
magnet
or
rather
as
if
the
atom
had
regular
shape
like
a
triangle
square
or
pentagon
and
each
angle
was
a
pole
thus
enabling
it
to
unite
with
three
four
five
or
more
atoms
of
other
substances
thus
one
atom
of
nitrogen
unites
with
three
of
hydrogen
one
of
carbon
with
four
of
hydrogen
and
so
on
every
substance
has
therefore
what
is
called
its
or
power
of
uniting
with
it
a
greater
or
less
quantity
of
other
atoms
and
conversely
that
of
replacing
in
combinations
other
atoms
or
groups
of
atoms
the
sum
of
whose
quantivalence
equals
its
own
thus
one
atom
of
carbon
which
has
four
poles
combines
with
four
atoms
of
hydrogen
or
chlorine
which
is
unipolar
but
with
only
two
of
oxygen
which
are
bipolar
while
the
oxygen
atom
combines
with
two
of
hydrogen
and
that
of
chlorine
with
one
atom
only
of
hydrogen
the
analogy
between
the
single
atomic
and
electrical
poles
on
the
one
hand
and
the
dual
and
magnetic
poles
on
the
other
will
be
evident
if
we
consider
what
occurs
if
a
electrified
positively
is
brought
near
a
similar
ball
electrified
negatively
they
attract
each
other
and
the
one
becomes
the
pole
of
the
other
but
if
separated
each
carries
with
it
its
own
electrical
charge
but
the
separate
balls
or
poles
though
no
longer
influencing
each
other
are
not
isolated
for
each
draws
by
induction
an
electrical
charge
opposite
to
its
own
to
the
extremity
of
the
nearest
conductor
and
thus
creates
for
itself
a
new
or
second
pole
polarity
in
fact
involves
opposition
of
relations
or
two
poles
and
electrical
only
differs
from
magnetic
polarity
in
the
fact
that
in
the
latter
the
two
poles
are
in
the
same
body
while
in
the
former
they
are
in
separate
bodies
for
read
atoms
and
we
have
an
explanation
of
the
univalent
atoms
like
those
of
chlorine
and
sodium
which
act
as
single
poles
and
this
is
confirmed
by
the
fact
that
such
atoms
are
never
found
isolated
but
are
always
associated
in
a
molecule
with
at
least
one
other
atom
which
forms
the
opposite
pole
of
the
molecular
system
bivalent
or
magnetic
atoms
on
the
other
hand
which
have
two
poles
like
those
of
mercury
and
zinc
may
constitute
a
complete
polar
system
and
be
found
isolated
and
form
the
class
of
molecules
which
consist
of
single
atoms
this
conception
of
the
polarity
of
atoms
enables
us
to
understand
the
way
in
which
the
almost
infinite
variety
of
substances
existing
in
the
world
is
built
up
from
a
comparatively
few
simple
elements
atoms
and
radicals
which
are
multipolar
can
attract
and
form
molecules
with
as
many
other
atoms
or
radicals
as
they
have
poles
this
is
called
their
degree
of
atomicity
which
is
the
same
as
their
quantivalence
and
each
of
these
atoms
or
radicals
may
be
replaced
by
some
other
atom
or
radical
which
presents
to
any
pole
a
more
powerful
polarity
thus
compounds
may
be
built
up
of
great
and
varied
complexity
for
the
quality
of
any
compound
may
be
greatly
altered
by
any
one
of
the
substitutions
at
any
one
of
the
poles
and
the
molecules
or
small
specimens
of
matter
may
be
thus
built
up
into
very
complex
aggregations
of
atoms
some
single
molecules
containing
more
than
a
hundred
atoms
thus
carbon
has
four
poles
or
is
quadrivalent
and
its
atoms
possess
the
power
of
combining
among
themselves
to
an
almost
indefinite
extent
and
forming
groups
of
great
stability
thus
carbon
radicals
may
be
formed
in
very
great
number
each
affording
a
nucleus
upon
which
compound
radicals
may
be
built
up
so
that
carbon
has
been
aptly
called
the
skeleton
of
almost
all
the
varied
compounds
of
the
more
complex
forms
of
inorganic
matter
as
well
as
the
principal
foundation
of
organic
life
nor
is
this
all
for
the
qualities
of
substances
depend
not
only
on
the
qualities
of
their
constituent
elements
but
also
on
the
manner
in
which
these
elements
are
grouped
two
substances
may
have
exactly
the
same
chemical
composition
and
yet
be
very
different
we
may
suppose
that
the
same
elements
affect
us
differently
according
as
they
are
grouped
thus
the
same
bricks
may
be
built
up
either
into
a
cube
or
pyramid
which
forms
are
extremely
stable
and
can
only
be
taken
in
pieces
brick
by
brick
or
into
a
gothic
arch
which
all
tumbles
to
pieces
if
a
single
brick
forming
the
keystone
is
displaced
as
an
instance
of
this
butyric
acid
which
gives
the
offensive
odour
to
rancid
butter
has
exactly
the
same
composition
as
acetic
ether
which
gives
the
flavour
to
a
ripe
apple
they
consist
of
the
same
number
of
atoms
of
the
same
hydrogen
and
in
the
same
proportions
this
applies
to
a
number
of
substances
and
is
called
isomerism
or
formation
of
different
wholes
from
the
same
parts
the
principle
of
polarity
therefore
aided
by
the
subsidiary
conditions
of
quantivalence
atomicity
and
isomerism
gives
the
clue
to
the
construction
of
the
inorganic
world
out
of
some
seventy
elementary
substances
of
the
substances
thus
formed
whether
of
molecules
or
of
combinations
of
molecules
some
are
stable
and
some
unstable
as
a
rule
the
simpler
combinations
are
the
most
stable
and
instability
increases
with
complexity
thus
the
diamond
which
is
merely
a
crystal
of
pure
carbon
is
very
hard
and
indestructible
while
dynamite
or
which
is
a
very
complex
compound
explodes
at
a
touch
the
stability
of
a
substance
depends
partly
on
the
stable
structure
of
its
component
elements
and
partly
on
their
mutual
affinity
being
strong
enough
to
keep
them
together
in
presence
of
the
attractions
of
other
outside
elements
which
in
the
case
of
most
natural
substances
at
the
surface
of
the
earth
consist
principally
of
air
and
water
thus
the
rocks
earths
metallic
oxides
water
carbonic
dioxide
and
nitrogen
are
extremely
stable
and
resist
decomposition
or
chemical
union
with
other
substances
with
great
energy
with
regard
to
all
substances
this
law
holds
good
that
the
tendency
is
to
fall
back
from
a
less
stable
to
a
more
stable
condition
and
that
such
a
falling
back
is
always
attended
with
an
evolution
of
heat
while
on
the
other
hand
heat
is
always
absorbed
and
disappears
whenever
the
elements
of
a
more
stable
substance
are
made
to
enter
into
a
less
stable
condition
thus
when
wood
burns
there
is
a
falling
back
from
a
substance
unstable
on
account
of
its
affinity
for
the
oxygen
in
the
air
into
the
stable
products
carbonic
dioxide
and
water
and
the
heat
evolved
is
the
effect
of
this
fall
as
the
tendency
of
all
changes
is
towards
stability
we
arrive
at
the
following
law
which
is
one
of
the
most
recent
generalisations
of
modern
chemistry
in
all
cases
of
chemical

the
tendency
is
to
those

this
however
does
not
imply
that
the

may
not
be
overcome
and
unstable
products
formed
for
just
as
a
weight
may
be
lifted
against

so
may
the

by
a
sufficient

acting

heat

the
principal

of
supplying
this

and
by
increasing
it
sufficiently
not
only
are
molecules
drawn

and
most
solids
converted

into

but
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
at
extremely
high
temperatures
such
as

prevail
in
the
sun
all
matter
would
be
resolved
into
isolated
or
dissociated

thus
water
at

into

of

only
the
subject
might
be
pursued
further
but
enough
has
been
said
for
the
present
purpose
to
show
that
the
universe
consists
of
atoms
which
are
endowed
with
polarity
and
that
as
diminished
temperature
allows
these
atoms
to
come
closer
together
and
form

matter
in

polarity
in

contrast

and
life
of

polarity
having
been
established
as
the
universal
law
of
the
inorganic
world
we
have
now
to
pass
to
the
organic
or
world
of
life
at
first
sight
there
seems
to
be
a
great
gulf
fixed
between
the
living
and
the
dead
which
no
bridge
can
span
but
first
impressions
are
very
apt
to
deceive
us
and
when
things
are
traced
up
to
their
origins
we
often
find
them
getting
nearer
and
nearer
until
it
is
difficult
to
say
where
one
begins
and
the
other
ends
take
for
instance
such
an
antithesis
as
or
being
if
a
hunter
meets
a
grizzly
bear
in
the
rocky
mountains
one
would
say
that
no
distinction
can
be
sharper
than
whether
the
bear
eats
the
man
or
the
man
the
bear
in
the
one
case
there
is
a
man
and
in
the
other
a
bear
less
in
the
world
but
look
through
a
microscope
at
a
glass
of
water
and
you
may
see
two
specks
of
substance
swimming
in
it
they
are
living
creatures
for
they
eat
and
grow
and
thrust
out
and
retract
processes
of
their
formless
mass
which
serve
as
temporary
legs
and
arms
for
seizing
food
and
for
voluntary
motion
in
short
they
are
each
what
may
be
called
strictly
individual
am≈ìb√¶
forming
separate
units
of
the
animated
creation
as
much
as
the
man
and
the
bear
but
if
the
two
happen
to
come
in
contact
what
happens
the
two
slimy
masses
involve
one
another
and
coalesce
and
the
resulting
am≈ìba
swims
away
merrily
as
two
gentlemen
rolled
into
one
now
in
his
case
what
became
of
their
individualities
did
am≈ìba
a
eat
am≈ìba
b
or
and
is
the
resulting
am≈ìba
a
survival
of
a
or
of
b
or
of
both
or
neither
of
them
and
what
becomes
of
the
antithesis
of
or
being
which
was
so
clear
and
distinct
in
the
highly
specialised
forms
of
life
and
is
so
evanescent
in
the
simpler
forms
this
illustration
may
serve
to
teach
us
how
necessary
it
is
to
trace
things
up
to
their
origins
before
expressing
too
trenchant
and
confident
opinions
as
to
their
nature
and
relations
in
the
case
of
the
organic
and
inorganic
worlds
the
proper
course
obviously
is
not
to
draw
conclusions
from
extreme
and
highly
specialised
instances
but
to
follow
life
downwards
to
its
simplest
and
most
primitive
form
and
matter
upwards
to
the
form
which
approaches
most
nearly
to
this
form
of
life
following
matter
upwards
we
find
a
regular
progression
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
take
the
diamond
which
is
one
of
the
simplest
of
substances
being
merely
the
crystallised
form
of
a
single
ultimate
element
carbon
it
is
extremely
hard
and
extremely
stable
ascending
to
compounds
of
two
three
or
more
elements
we
get
substances
which
are
more
complex
and
less
stable
and
at
last
we
arrive
at
combinations
which
involve
many
elements
and
are
extremely
complex
among
these
latter
substances
are
some
called
colloids
which
are
neither
solid
like
crystals
nor
fluid
like
liquids
but
in
an
intermediate
state
like
jelly
or
the
white
of
an
egg
in
which
the
molecules
have
great
mobility
and
are
at
a
considerable
distance
apart
so
that
water
can
penetrate
their
mass
these
colloids
are
for
the
most
part
very
complicated
compounds
of
various
elements
based
on
a
nucleus
of
carbon
which
from
its
atom
having
four
poles
with
strong
mutual
attractions
is
eminently
qualified
for
forming
what
may
be
called
the
inner
skeleton
of
these
complex
combinations
colloids
of
this
description
form
the
last
stage
of
the
ascending
line
from
inorganic
matter
to
organic
life
next
let
us
trace
life
downwards
towards
matter
there
is
a
constant
succession
from
the
more
to
the
less
complex
and
differentiated
from
man
through
mammals
reptiles
fishes
and
a
long
chain
of
more
simple
forms
until
at
its
end
we
come
to
the
two
last
links
which
are
the
same
for
all
animals
all
plants
and
all
forms
of
animated
existence
the
last
link
but
one
is
the
cell
the
last
of
all
is
protoplasm
protoplasm
or
as
huxley
calls
it
physical
basis
of
life
is
a
colourless
substance
absolutely
homogeneous
without
parts
or
structure
in
fact
a
mere
microscopic
speck
of
jelly
the
cell
is
the
first
step
in
the
specialisation
of
protoplasm
the
outer
layer
of
which
in
contact
with
the
surrounding
environment
becoming
hardened
so
as
to
form
an
enclosing
while
a
portion
of
the
enclosed
protoplasm
condenses
into
a
nucleus
in
which
a
further
condensation
makes
what
is
called
the
nucleolus
or
second
smaller
nucleus
this
constitutes
the
nucleated
cell
whose
repeated
subdivision
into
other
similar
cells
in
geometrical
progression
furnishes
the
raw
material
out
of
which
all
the
varied
structures
of
the
world
of
life
are
built
up
plants
and
animals
bones
muscles
and
organs
of
sense
are
all
composed
of
modified
cells
hardened
flattened
or
otherwise
altered
as
the
case
may
require
if
we
trace
life
up
to
its
origin
in
the
individual
instead
of
in
the
species
we
arrive
at
the
same
result
all
plants
and
animals
whether
of
the
lowest
or
highest
forms
fish
reptile
bird
mammal
man
begin
their
individual
existence
as
a
speck
of
protoplasm
passing
into
a
nucleated
cell
which
contains
in
it
the
whole
principle
of
its
subsequent
evolution
into
the
mature
and
completed
form
protoplasm
is
therefore
evidently
the
nearest
approach
of
life
to
matter
and
if
life
ever
originated
from
atomic
and
molecular
combinations
it
was
in
this
form
to
suppose
that
any
more
complex
form
of
life
however
humble
could
originate
from
chemical
combinations
would
be
a
violation
of
the
law
of
evolution
which
shows
a
uniform
development
from
the
simple
to
the
complex
and
never
a
sudden
jump
passing
at
a
bound
over
intermediate
grades
to
understand
life
therefore
we
must
understand
protoplasm
for
protoplasm
closely
as
it
approximates
to
colloid
matter
is
thoroughly
alive
a
whole
family
the
monera
consist
simply
of
a
living
globule
of
jelly
which
has
not
even
begun
to
be
differentiated
every
molecule
as
in
a
crystal
is
of
homogeneous
chemical
composition
and
an
epitome
of
the
whole
mass
there
are
no
special
parts
no
organs
told
off
for
particular
functions
and
yet
all
reproduction
sensation
and
performed
but
each
by
the
whole
body
the
becomes
a
mouth
to
swallow
and
turning
inside
out
a
stomach
to
digest
it
shoots
out
tongues
of
jelly
to
move
and
feel
with
and
presently
withdraws
them
with
these
attributes
it
is
impossible
to
deny
to
protoplasm
the
full
attributes
of
life
or
to
doubt
that
like
the
atom
in
the
material
world
it
is
the
primary
element
of
organic
or
living
existence
given
the
atom
we
can
trace
up
step
by
step
the
whole
evolution
of
matter
so
given
the
protoplasm
we
can
trace
up
the
evolution
of
life
by
progressive
stages
to
its
highest
to
understand
life
therefore
we
must
begin
by
trying
to
understand
protoplasm
what
is
protoplasm
in
its
substance
it
is
a
nitrogenous
carbon
compound
differing
only
from
other
similar
compounds
of
the
albuminous
family
of
colloid
by
the
extremely
complex
composition
of
its
atoms
it
consists
of
five
elements
and
its
average
composition
is
said
by
chemists
to
be
per
cent
carbon
oxygen
nitrogen
hydrogen
sulphur
its
peculiar
qualities
therefore
including
life
are
not
the
result
of
any
new
and
peculiar
atom
added
to
the
known
chemical
compounds
of
the
same
family
but
of
the
manner
of
grouping
and
motions
of
these
material
elements
it
has
in
a
remarkable
degree
the
faculty
of
absorbing
water
so
that
its
molecules
seem
to
float
in
it
in
a
condition
of
aggregation
which
seems
to
be
necessary
for
the
complex
molecular
movements
which
are
the
cause
or
accompaniment
of
life
thus
many
seeds
and
animalcul√¶
if
perfectly
dry
may
remain
apparently
as
dead
and
as
unchanging
as
crystals
for
years
or
even
as
in
the
case
of
the
mummy
wheat
for
centuries
to
revive
into
life
when
moistened
but
in
addition
to
those
material
qualities
in
which
protoplasm
seems
to
differ
only
from
a
whole
group
of
similar
compounds
of
the
type
of
glycerine
by
the
greater
complexity
and
mobility
of
its
molecules
it
has
developed
the
new
and
peculiar
element
which
is
called
life
life
in
its
essence
is
manifested
by
the
faculties
of
nutrition
sensation
movement
and
reproduction
as
regards
nutrition
there
is
this
essential
difference
between
living
and
matter
the
latter
if
it
feeds
and
grows
at
all
does
so
only
by
taking
on
fresh
molecules
of
its
own
substance
on
its
outer
surface
as
in
the
case
of
a
small
of
ice
in
freezing
water
if
it
feeds
on
foreign
matter
and
throughout
its
mass
it
does
so
only
in
the
way
of
chemical
combination
forming
a
new
product
living
matter
on
the
other
hand
feeds
internally
and
works
up
foreign
substances
by
the
process
we
call
digestion
into
molecules
like
its
own
which
it
assimilates
rejecting
as
waste
any
surplus
or
foreign
matter
which
it
can
not
incorporate
it
thus
grows
and
decays
as
assimilation
or
waste
preponderates
remaining
always
itself
the
distinction
will
be
clear
if
we
consider
what
happens
when
water
rusts
iron
in
a
certain
sense
the
iron
may
be
said
to
eat
the
oxygen
reject
the
hydrogen
and
grow
or
increase
in
weight
by
what
it
feeds
on
but
the
result
is
not
a
bigger
piece
of
iron
but
a
new
substance
rust
or
oxide
of
iron
that
living
matter
should
feed
internally
is
not
so
wonderful
for
its
condition
may
well
enable
foreign
molecules
to
penetrate
its
mass
and
come
in
contact
with
its
own
interior
molecules
but
it
is
an
experience
different
from
anything
known
in
the
inorganic
world
that
it
should
be
able
to
manufacture
molecules
of
protoplasm
like
its
own
out
of
these
foreign
molecules
and
thus
grow
by
assimilation
for
instance
when
am≈ìb√¶
bacteria
and
other
low
organisms
live
and
multiply
in
chemical
solutions
which
contain
no
protoplasm
but
only
inorganic
compounds
containing
the
requisite
atoms
for
making
protoplasm
or
when
a
plant
not
only
chemically
decomposes
carbonic
dioxide
exhaling
the
oxygen
and
depositing
the
carbon
in
its
stem
and
leaves
but
also
from
this
and
other
elements
drawn
from
the
soil
or
air
manufactures
the
living
protoplasm
which
courses
through
its
channels
the
result
is
that
life
has
manufactured
life
out
of
materials
if
we
take
sensation
this
in
its
last
analysis
is
change
or
molecular
motion
induced
in
a
body
by
the
action
of
its
environment
here
there
is
a
certain
analogy
between
living
and
matter
for
the
latter
does
respond
to
changes
in
the
surrounding
environment
as
in
the
case
of
heat
electricity
and
otherwise
but
living
matter
is
far
more
sensitive
the
changes
are
far
more
frequent
and
complex
and
in
certain
cases
they
are
accompanied
by
a
sensation
of
what
is
called
consciousness
which
in
the
higher
organisms
rises
into
a
perception
of
voluntary
effort
or
as
a
factor
in
the
transformation
of
energies
thus
it
happens
that
in
the
case
of
dead
matter
the
changes
produced
by
a
change
of
conditions
follow
fixed
laws
and
can
be
predicted
and
calculated
while
those
of
living
matter
are
apparently
uncertain
and
capricious
we
can
tell
how
much
an
iron
bar
will
expand
with
heat
but
we
can
not
say
whether
if
a
particle
of
food
is
brought
within
reach
of
an
am≈ìba
it
will
or
will
not
shoot
out
a
finger
to
seize
it
if
the
am≈ìba
is
hungry
it
probably
will
if
it
is
enjoying
a
siesta
after
a
full
meal
it
probably
will
not
the
case
of
sensation
includes
that
of
motion
which
is
after
all
only
sensation
applied
in
the
liberation
of
energy
of
position
which
has
by
some
chemical
process
become
stored
up
either
in
the
living
mass
or
in
some
special
organ
of
it
such
as
muscle
iron
for
instance
moves
when
it
expands
by
heat
or
is
attracted
by
a
magnet
but
it
moves
like
the
planets
by
fixed
and
calculable
laws
while
living
matter
moves
as
might
be
expected
from
the
variable
character
of
its
sensation
in
a
manner
which
often
can
not
be
calculated
there
are
cases
however
of
reflex
or
involuntary
motion
where
even
in
the
highest
living
organisms
sensation
and
motion
seem
to
follow
change
of
environment
in
a
fixed
and
invariable
sequence
as
in
shrinking
from
pain
touching
or
galvanising
a
nerve
and
it
may
be
that
the
apparent
spontaneousness
and
variability
of
living
motion
is
only
the
result
of
the
almost
infinitely
greater
complexity
and
mobility
of
the
elements
of
living
matter
reproduction
remains
which
is
the
faculty
most
characteristic
of
life
and
which
distinguishes
most
sharply
the
organic
from
the
inorganic
world
in
the
inorganic
there
is
no
known
process
by
which
dead
matter
reproduces
itself
as
the
cell
does
when
it
contracts
in
the
middle
and
splits
up
into
two
cells
which
in
their
turn
propagate
an
endless
number
of
similar
cells
increasing
in
geometrical
progression
until
they
supply
the
raw
material
from
which
all
the
countless
varieties
of
living
organisms
are
built
up
which
in
their
turn
repeat
the
process
and
reproduce
themselves
in
offspring
this
is
the
real
mystery
of
life
we
can
partly
see
or
suspect
how
its
other
faculties
might
arise
from
an
extension
of
the
known
qualities
and
laws
of
matter
and
of
energy
but
we
can
discern
no
analogy
between
the
nitrogenous
carbon
compound
which
makes
so
near
an
approach
to
protoplasm
in
its
chemical
composition
and
the
reproductive
protoplasm
which
is
fertile
increases
and
multiplies
and
replenishes
the
earth
can
the
gap
be
bridged
over
can
protoplasm
be
manufactured
out
of
chemical
elements
it
is
done
every
day
by
plants
which
make
protoplasm
out
of
inorganic
elements
and
by
the
lowest
forms
of
life
which
live
and
multiply
in
chemical
solutions
it
is
done
also
in
the
of
all
individuals
whose
primitive
cell
or
ovum
makes
thousands
or
millions
of
other
cells
each
containing
within
its
enclosing
membrane
as
much
protoplasm
as
there
was
in
the
unit
from
which
they
started
but
in
all
these
instances
there
was
the
living
principle
to
start
with
existing
in
the
primitive
speck
of
protoplasm
from
which
the
rest
were
developed
can
this
primitive
speck
be
created
or
in
other
words
can
protoplasm
be
artificially
manufactured
by
chemical
processes
the
answer
must
be
no
not
by
any
process
now
known
the
similarity
of
chemical
composition
and
the
increasing
conviction
of
the
universality
of
natural
law
and
of
evolution
have
led
to
a
very
general
belief
that
such
a
spontaneous
generation
of
life
must
be
possible
and
numerous
experiments
have
been
made
to
produce
it
for
a
time
the
balance
seemed
to
be
very
evenly
held
between
the
supporters
and
opponents
of
spontaneous
generation
in
fact
starting
from
the
assumption
which
at
first
was
common
to
both
sides
that
heat
equal
to
the
boiling
point
of
water
destroyed
all
life
organisms
spontaneous
generation
had
the
best
of
it
for
it
was
clearly
proved
that
living
organisms
did
appear
in
infusions
contained
in
vessels
which
had
been
hermetically
sealed
after
being
subjected
to
this
or
even
a
higher
degree
of
heat
but
subsequent
and
more
careful
experiments
have
shown
that
the
germs
or
spores
of
bacteria
and
other
animalcul√¶
which
are
generally
floating
in
the
air
can
when
dry
withstand
a
greater
degree
of
heat
and
that
when
the
experiments
are
made
in
optically
pure
air
no
life
ever
appears
and
the
infusions
never
putrefy
on
questions
of
this
sort
all
who
are
not
themselves
expert
experimentalists
must
be
guided
by
authority
and
we
may
be
content
to
accept
the
dictum
of
huxley
that
biogenesis
or
all
life
from
previous
life
was
along
the
whole
but
in
doing
so
we
must
accept
caution
with
organic
chemistry
molecular
physics
and
physiology
yet
in
their
infancy
and
every
day
making
prodigious
strides
it
would
be
the
height
of
presumption
for
any
man
to
say
that
the
conditions
under
which
matter
assumes
the
qualities
called
vital
may
not
some
day
be
artificially
brought
and
further
as
a
matter
not
of
proof
but
of
probability
if
it
were
given
me
to
look
beyond
the
abyss
of
geologically
recorded
time
to
the
still
more
remote
period
when
the
earth
was
passing
through
chemical
and
physical
conditions
which
it
can
never
see
again
i
should
expect
to
be
a
witness
of
the
evolution
of
living
protoplasms
from
such
is
the
cautious
candour
with
which
scientific
men
approach
problems
upon
which
theologians
dogmatise
with
the
unerring
intrepidity
of
ignorance
in
the
meantime
what
may
be
said
as
to
reservations
is
this
a
considerable
step
has
been
made
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
success
of
recent
chemistry
in
forming
artificially
what
are
called
organic
compounds
that
is
substances
which
were
previously
known
only
as
products
of
animal
or
vegetable
secretions
urea
for
instance
the
base
of
uric
acid
with
which
so
many
are
unfortunately
familiar
in
the
form
of
gout
indigotine
the
principle
of
the
blue
colouring
matter
of
the
indigo
plant
and
alizarine
that
of
madder
are
all
now
produced
artificially
and
have
even
become
important
articles
of
commerce
if
chemists
can
make
the
indigotine
which
the
growing
plant
elaborates
at
the
same
time
as
it
elaborates
protoplasm
may
we
not
hope
some
day
to
make
the
latter
as
well
as
the
former
product
now
organic
compounds
of
this
class
are
being
formed
artificially
every
day
and
it
is
said
that
chemists
have
already
succeeded
in
producing
several
hundreds
but
even
if
this
expectation
is
never
fulfilled
we
may
fall
back
on
second
reservation
of
the
enormous
difference
of
chemical
and
physical
conditions
in
the
early
stages
of
the
life
from
anything
now
known
it
has
been
calculated
that
the
temperature
when
it
first
started
on
its
career
as
an
independent
planet
was
something
like
fahrenheit
at
this
heat
probably
all
atoms
would
be
dissociated
but
as
the
temperature
diminished
they
would
come
closer
together
but
still
with
a
great
deal
of
motion
and
making
wide
excursions
which
might
bring
many
different
atoms
together
in
complex
though
unstable
combinations
moreover
carbon
which
is
the
basis
of
all
such
combinations
of
the
class
of
protoplasm
was
far
more
abundant
in
those
early
days
in
the
form
of
carbonic
dioxide
gas
before
the
enormous
amount
of
vegetable
matter
in
the
form
of
coal
and
otherwise
had
been
subtracted
from
it
in
any
case
the
first
protoplasm
must
be
extremely
ancient
for
the
remains
of
are
found
in
the
oldest
strata
and
vegetation
of
any
sort
implies
the
manufacture
of
protoplasm
from
inorganic
matter
the
passage
from
the
organic
into
the
inorganic
world
is
best
traced
by
following
the
line
of
researches
on
ferments
how
does
the
world
escape
being
choked
up
by
the
accumulation
of
dead
organic
matter
throughout
innumerable
ages
by
what
are
called
ferments
inducing
processes
of
fermentation
and
putrefaction
by
which
the
course
of
life
is
reversed
and
the
organic
elements
are
taken
to
pieces
and
restored
to
the
inorganic
world
pasteur
proved
in
opposition
to
the
theories
of
liebig
and
other
older
chemists
that
this
was
not
done
directly
by
the
oxygen
of
the
air
but
through
the
intermediate
agency
of
living
microbes
whose
spores
floating
in
the
air
took
up
their
abode
and
multiplied
wherever
they
found
an
appropriate
habitation
given
an
air
purified
from
germs
or
a
temperature
low
enough
to
prevent
them
from
germinating
and
putrescible
substances
would
keep
sweet
for
ever
the
practical
realisation
of
this
is
seen
in
the
enormous
commerce
in
canned
meats
and
fruits
and
in
the
imports
of
frozen
beef
and
mutton
causing
a
fall
of
rents
and
much
lamentation
among
british
landlords
and
farmers
but
then
the
question
was
asked
how
are
your
microscopic
organisms
disposed
of
what
are
the
ferments
of
your
ferments
for
even
microscopic
bacteria
and
vibrios
would
in
time
choke
up
the
world
by
their
residue
if
not
got
rid
of
pasteur
answered
that
the
ferments
are
destroyed
by
a
new
series
of
in
the
air
and
these
by
other
aerobes
in
succession
until
the
ultimate
products
are
oxidised
in
the
destruction
of
what
has
lived
all
is
reduced
to
the
simultaneous
action
of
the
three
great
natural
putrefaction
and
slow
combustion
a
living
being
animal
or
vegetable
or
the
of
either
having
just
died
is
exposed
to
the
air
the
life
that
has
abandoned
it
is
succeeded
by
life
under
other
forms
in
the
superficial
parts
accessible
to
the
air
the
germs
of
the
infinitely
little
aerobes
flourish
and
multiply
the
carbon
hydrogen
and
nitrogen
of
the
organic
matter
are
transformed
by
the
oxygen
of
the
air
and
under
the
vital
activity
of
the
aerobes
into
carbonic
acid
the
vapour
of
water
and
ammonia
the
combustion
continues
as
long
as
organic
matter
and
air
are
present
together
at
the
same
time
the
superficial
combustion
is
going
on
fermentation
and
putrefaction
are
performing
their
work
in
the
midst
of
the
mass
by
means
of
the
developed
germs
of
the
original
microbes
which
note
do
not
need
oxygen
to
live
but
which
oxygen
causes
to
perish
gradually
the
phenomena
of
destruction
are
at
last
accomplished
through
the
work
of
latent
fermentation
and
slow
this
seems
a
complete
demonstration
of
the
passage
of
the
organic
into
the
inorganic
world
in
the
way
of
analysis
or
taking
the
puzzle
to
pieces
in
the
opposite
way
of
synthesis
or
putting
it
together
the
nearest
approach
yet
made
has
been
in
the
manufacture
of
those
organic
compounds
already
referred
to
such
as
urea
alizarine
indigotine
and
other
products
which
had
hitherto
only
been
known
as
products
of
animal
or
vegetable
life
of
these
a
vast
number
have
been
already
formed
from
inorganic
elements
by
chemical
processes
and
almost
every
day
announces
some
fresh
discovery
under
these
circumstances
it
is
unsafe
to
affirm
either
on
the
one
hand
that
the
problem
has
been
solved
and
that
life
has
ever
been
made
in
a
laboratory
or
on
the
other
hand
that
there
is
any
such
great
gulf
fixed
between
the
organic
and
the
inorganic
that
we
can
assume
a
break
requiring
secondary
supernatural
interference
to
surmount
it
and
ignore
the
good
old
maxim
that
nihil
facit
per
positive
proof
is
wanting
but
the
probabilities
point
here
as
they
do
everywhere
else
throughout
the
universe
to
the
truth
of
the
theory
of
as
opposed
to
that
of
it
remains
to
show
how
the
fundamental
law
of
polarity
affects
the
more
complex
relations
of
life
and
of
its
various
combinations
and
here
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
as
the
factors
of
the
problem
become
more
intricate
and
complex
so
also
do
the
laws
which
regulate
their
existence
and
action
polarity
is
no
longer
a
simple
question
of
attraction
and
repulsion
at
the
two
ends
of
a
magnet
or
at
the
opposite
poles
of
an
atom
it
appears
rather
as
a
general
law
under
which
as
the
simple
and
absolute
becomes
differentiated
by
evolution
into
the
complex
and
manifold
it
does
so
under
the
condition
of
developing
contrasts
for
every
there
is
a
for
every
like
an
unlike
one
can
not
exist
without
the
other
and
although
apparently
antagonistic
harmonious
order
is
only
possible
by
their
and
mutual
balance
this
is
so
important
that
it
may
be
well
to
make
the
idea
clearer
by
an
illustration
the
earth
revolves
round
the
sun
in
its
annual
orbit
under
the
influence
of
two
forces
the
centripetal
or
force
of
gravity
tending
to
draw
it
towards
the
sun
and
the
centrifugal
tending
to
make
it
dart
away
into
infinite
space
during
half
the
orbit
the
centripetal
seems
to
be
gaining
ground
on
the
centrifugal
and
the
earth
is
approaching
nearer
to
the
sun
if
this
continued
it
would
revolve
ever
nearer
and
soon
fall
into
it
but
the
centrifugal
force
is
gradually
recruiting
its
strength
from
the
increased
velocity
of
the
earth
until
it
first
equals
the
centripetal
and
finally
outstrips
it
and
for
the
remaining
half
of
the
orbit
it
is
constantly
gaining
ground
if
this
went
on
the
earth
would
fly
off
into
the
chilly
regions
of
outer
space
but
the
centripetal
force
in
its
turn
regains
the
ascendency
and
thus
by
the
balance
of
the
two
forces
our
planet
describes
the
beautiful
ellipse
its
harmonious
orbit
as
a
habitable
globe
while
comets
in
which
one
or
the
other
force
unduly
preponderates
for
long
periods
are
alternately
drawn
into
fiery
proximity
to
the
sun
and
sent
careering
through
regions
void
of
heat
compare
this
passage
from
herbert
spencer
from
antagonist
physical
forces
as
from
antagonist
emotions
in
each
man
so
from
the
antagonist
social
tendencies
emotions
create
there
always
results
not
a
medium
state
but
a
rhythm
between
opposite
states
the
one
force
or
tendency
is
not
continuously
counterbalanced
by
the
other
force
or
tendency
but
now
the
one
greatly
preponderates
and
presently
by
reaction
there
comes
a
preponderance
of
the
and
again
is
nowhere
a
balanced
judgment
and
a
balanced
action
but
always
a
cancelling
of
one
another
by
opposite
errors
men
pair
off
in
insane
parties
as
emerson
puts
the
reader
will
now
begin
to
understand
the
sense
in
which
polarity
applies
to
these
complex
conditions
of
an
advanced
evolution
to
return
however
from
this
digression
to
the
point
at
which
it
began
viz
the
origin
of
life
we
have
to
show
how
the
law
of
polarity
prevails
in
the
organic
as
well
as
in
the
inorganic
world
in
the
first
place
the
material
to
which
all
life
is
attached
from
the
speck
of
protoplasm
to
the
brain
of
man
is
strictly
a
chemical
product
of
atoms
and
molecules
bound
together
by
the
same
polar
laws
as
those
of
inorganic
matter
in
like
manner
all
the
essential
processes
by
which
life
lives
moves
and
has
its
being
are
equally
mechanical
and
chemical
if
the
brain
receiving
a
telegram
from
without
through
the
optic
nerve
sends
a
reply
along
another
nerve
which
liberates
energy
stored
up
in
a
muscle
and
produces
motion
the
messages
are
received
and
transmitted
like
those
sent
by
a
voltaic
battery
along
the
wires
of
a
telegraph
and
the
energy
is
stored
up
by
the
slow
combustion
of
food
in
oxygen
just
as
that
of
the
is
produced
by
the
combustion
of
coal
all
this
is
mechanical
inorganic
and
therefore
polar
but
when
we
come
to
the
conditions
of
life
proper
we
find
the
influence
of
polarity
mainly
in
this
that
as
it
develops
from
simpler
into
more
complex
forms
it
does
so
under
the
law
of
developing
contrasts
or
opposite
polarities
which
are
necessary
complements
of
each
existence
thus
as
we
ascend
in
the
scale
of
life
we
find
two
primitive
polarities
developed
that
of
plant
and
animal
and
that
of
male
and
female

of

animals

judging
by

impressions
nothing
can
be
more
distinct
no
one
whether
scientific
or
unscientific
could
mistake
an
oak
tree
for
an
ox
to
the
unscientific
observer
the
tree
differs
in
having
no
power
of
free
movement
and
apparently
no
sensation
or
consciousness
in
fact
hardly
any
of
the
attributes
of
life
the
scientific
observer
sees
still
more
fundamental
differences
in
the
fact
that
the
plant
feeds
on
inorganic
ingredients
out
of
which
it
manufactures
living
matter
or
protoplasm
while
the
animal
can
only
provide
itself
with
protoplasm
from
that
already
manufactured
by
the
plant
the
ox
who
lives
on
grass
could
not
live
on
what
the
grass
thrives
on
viz
carbon
oxygen
hydrogen
and
nitrogen
the
contrast
is
so
striking
that
the
vegetable
world
has
been
called
the
producer
and
the
animal
world
the
consumer
of
nature
again
the
plant
derives
the
material
framework
of
its
structure
from
the
air
by
breathing
in
through
its
leaves
the
carbonic
dioxide
present
in
the
atmosphere
decomposing
it
fixing
the
carbon
in
its
roots
stem
and
branches
and
exhaling
the
oxygen
the
animal
exactly
reverses
the
process
inhaling
the
oxygen
of
the
air
combining
it
with
the
carbon
of
its
food
and
exhaling
carbonic
dioxide
thus
a
complete
polarity
is
established
as
we
see
in
the
aquarium
where
plant
and
animal
life
balance
each
other
and
the
opposites
live
and
thrive
where
the
existence
of
either
would
be
impossible
without
the
other
sharp
however
as
the
contrast
appears
to
be
in
the
more
specialised
and
developed
specimens
of
the
two
worlds
we
have
here
another
instance
of
the
difficulty
of
trusting
to
first
impressions
and
have
to
modify
our
conceptions
greatly
if
we
trace
animal
and
vegetable
life
up
to
their
simplest
forms
and
earliest
origins
in
the
first
place
each
individual
vegetable
or
animal
begins
its
existence
from
a
simple
piece
of
pure
protoplasm
this
develops
in
the
same
way
into
a
nucleated
cell
by
whose
repeated
subdivision
the
raw
material
is
provided
for
both
structures
alike
the
chief
difference
at
this
early
stage
is
that
the
animal
cells
remain
soft
and
naked
while
those
of
vegetables
secrete
a
comparatively
solid
which
makes
them
less
mobile
and
plastic
this
gives
greater
rigidity
to
the
frame
and
tissues
of
the
plant
and
prevents
the
development
of
the
finer
organs
of
sensation
and
other
vital
processes
which
characterise
the
animal
but
this
is
a
difference
of
development
only
and
the
origination
of
the
future
life
from
the
speck
of
protoplasm
is
the
same
in
both
worlds
if
instead
of
looking
at
the
origin
of
individuals
we
trace
back
the
various
forms
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
from
the
more
complex
to
the
simpler
forms
we
find
the
distinctions
between
the
two
disappearing
until
at
last
we
arrive
at
a
vanishing
point
where
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
the
organism
is
an
animal
or
a
plant
a
whole
family
comprising
sponges
corals
and
are
called
zoophytes
or
from
the
difficulty
of
assigning
them
to
one
kingdom
or
the
other
on
the
whole
they
rather
more
resemble
animals
and
are
generally
classed
with
them
though
they
lack
many
of
their
most
essential
qualities
and
in
form
often
bear
a
close
resemblance
to
plants
but
when
we
descend
a
step
lower
in
the
scale
of
existence
we
come
to
a
large
which
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
they
are
either
plants
or
animals
in
fact
scientific
observers
have
classed
them
sometimes
as
belonging
to
one
and
sometimes
to
the
other
kingdom
and
it
was
an
organism
of
this
class
looking
at
which
through
a
microscope
huxley
pronounced
it
to
be
probably
a
plant
while
tyndall
exclaimed
that
he
would
as
soon
call
a
sheep
a
vegetable
they
are
mostly
microscopic
and
are
the
first
step
in
organised
development
from
the
monera
which
are
mere
specks
of
homogeneous
protoplasm
small
as
they
are
they
have
played

important
part

has
in
many
instances
the
power
of
secreting
a
solid
skeleton
or
a
minute
and
delicate
envelope
or
shell
the
petrified
remains
of
which
form
entire
mountains
thus
the
nummulitic
limestone
which
forms
high
ranges
on
the
alps
and
himalayas
and
of
which
the
pyramids
are
built
consists
of
the
petrified
skeletons
of
a
species
of
radiolaria
or
shells
forming
the
complicated
and
elegant
mansion
with
many
rooms
and

of
the
formless
slimy

which
constitutes
the
living

chalk
also
and
the
formation
which
is
accumulating
at
the
bottom
of
deep
oceans
are
the
results
of
the
fall
of
the
microscopic
snowdrift
of
shells
of
the
globigenera
and
other
protistic
forms
swimming
in

and
in

the

of
the
family
of
zoophytes
or
form
the
coral
reefs
and
islands
so
numerous
in
the
pacific
and
indian
oceans
and
are
the
basis
of
the
vast
masses
of
coralline
limestone
deposited
in
the
coal
era
and
other
past
geological
periods
as
development
proceeds
the
distinction
between
plants
and
animals
becomes
more
apparent
though
even
here
the
simplest
and
earliest
forms
often
show
signs
of
a
common
origin
by
interchanging
some
of
the
fundamental
attributes
of
the
two
kingdoms
thus
the
essential
condition
of
plant
existence
is
to
live
on
inorganic
food
which
they
manufacture
into
protoplasm
by
working
up
simple
combinations
into
others
more
complicated
their
diet
consists
of
water
carbonic
dioxide
and
ammonia
they
take
in
carbonic
dioxide
and
give
out
oxygen
while
animals
do
exactly
the
reverse
but
the
fungi
live
like
animals
upon
organic
food
consisting
of
complicated
combinations
of
carbon
which
they
assimilate
and
like
animals
they
inhale
oxygen
and
give
out
carbonic
dioxide
lichens
afford
a
very
curious
instance
of
the
association
of
vegetable
and
animal
functions
in
the
same
plant
they
are
really
formed
of
two
distinct
organisms
a
body
which
is
a
low
form
of
alga
or
and
a
parasitic
form
of
fungus
which
lives
upon
it
the
former
has
a
plant
life
living
on
inorganic
matter
and
forming
the
green
cells
or
chlorophyll
which
are
the
essential
property
of
plants
enabling
them
under
the
action
of
the
rays
to
decompose
carbonic
dioxide
while
the
parasite
lives
like
an
animal
on
the
formed
protoplasm
of
the
parent
stem
forming
threads
of
colourless
cells
which
envelop
and
interlace
with
the
original
lichen
of
which
they
constitute
the
principal
mass
as
in
a
tree
overgrown
with
ivy
even
in
existing
and
highly
developed
plants
we
find
some
curious
instances
of
reversion
towards
animal
life
certain
plants
for
instance
like
the
dion√¶a
or
finding
it
difficult
to
obtain
the
requisite
supply
of
nitrogenous
food
in
a
fluid
state
from
the
arid
or
marshy
soil
in
which
they
grow
have
acquired
a
habit
of
supplying
the
deficiency
by
taking
to
an
animal
diet
and
eating
flies
conjoined
with
this
is
a
more
highly
developed
sensitiveness
and
power
of
what
appears
to
be
voluntary
motion
and
a
faculty
of
secreting
a
sort
of
gastric
juice
in
which
the
flies
are
digested
the
fundamental
property
also
of
decomposing
carbonic
dioxide
and
exhaling
oxygen
depends
on
light
stimulating
a
peculiar
chemical
action
of
the
chlorophyll
and
at
night
leaves
breathe
like
lungs
exhaling
not
oxygen
but
the
carbonic
dioxide
the
records
of
geology
imperfect
as
they
are
show
a
continued
progression
from
these
simple
and
neutral
organisms
to
higher
and
more
differentiated
forms
both
in
the
animal
and
vegetable
worlds
these
records
are
imperfect
because
the
soft
bodies
of
the
simpler
and
for
the
most
part
microscopic
forms
of
protoplasm
and
cell
life
are
not
capable
of
being
preserved
in
petrifactions
and
it
is
only
when
they
happen
to
have
secreted
shells
or
skeletons
that
we
have
a
chance
of
identifying
them
still
we
have
a
sufficient
number
of
remains
in
the
different
geological
strata
to
enable
us
to
trace
development
thus
in
the
vegetable
world
in
the
earliest
strata
the
laurentian
cambrian
and
silurian
forming
the
primordial
period
which
forms
a
thickness
of
some
feet
of
the
more

that
of
the
whole
of
the
subsequent
strata
primary
secondary
tertiary
and
quaternary
taken
find
only
vegetable
remains
of
the
lowest
group
of

that
of
the
tangles
or
alg√¶
which
live
in

forests
of
these
like
those
of
the
aleutian
islands
in
some
of
which
single
tangles
stream
to
the
length
of
sixty
feet
and
floating
masses
like
those
of
the
sargasso
sea
appear
to
have
constituted
the
sole
vegetation
of
these
prim√¶val
periods
the
primary
epoch
which
comes
next
comprises
the
devonian
or
old
red
sandstone
the
carboniferous
or
coal
system
and
the
permian
the
average
thickness
of
the
three
together
amounting
to
about
feet
in
these
the
family
of
ferns
predominates
the
remains
of
which
constitute
the
bulk
of
the
large
strata
of

forming
in
modern
times
our
great
resource
for

which
in
a
transformed
shape
does
so
much
of
our

pines
begin
to
appear
though
sparingly
in
this
epoch
the
secondary
epoch
comprises
the
triassic
the
jurassic
and
the
cretaceous
or
chalk
formation
the
average
thickness
of
the
three
amounting
to
about
feet
in
this
era
a
higher
species
of
vegetation
predominates
that
of
the
gymnosperms
or
plants
having
naked
seeds
of
which
the
pines
or
conifer√¶
and
the
or
cycade√¶
are
the
two
principal
classes
as
in
the
case
of
the
former
epoch
traces
of
the
approaching
higher
organisation
in
the
form
of
trees
began
to
appear
towards
its
close
the
tertiary
period
extends
from
the
end
of
the
chalk
to
the
commencement
of
the
quaternary
or
modern
period
it
is
divided
into
the
eocene
or
older
the
miocene
or
middle
and
the
pliocene
or
newest
tertiary
system
though
the
division
is
somewhat
arbitrary
depending
on
the
number
of
existing
species
mostly
of
shellfish
which
have
been
found
in
each
the
average
thickness
of
the
three
together
is
about
feet
in
this
formation
a
still
higher
class
of
vegetation
of
the
same
order
as
that
now
existing
which
made
its
first
appearance
in
the
chalk
period
has
become
predominant
it
is
that
of
angiosperms
or
plants
with
covered
seeds
forming
leafy
forests
of
true
trees
this
group
is
divided
into
the
two
classes
of
monocotyledons
or
plants
and
dicotyledons
or
plants
with
double
the
monocotyledons
spring
from
a
single
germ
leaf
and
are
of
simpler
organisation
than
the
other
class
they
comprise
the
grasses
rushes
lilies
irids
orchids
and
a
number
of
aquatic
plants
and
in
their
highest
form
develop
into
the
families
of
the
palms
and
bananas
the
dicotyledons
include
all
forms
of
forest
trees
almost
all
fruits
and
flowers
in
fact
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
vegetable
world
familiar
to
man
as
coming
into
immediate
relation
with
it
except
in
the
case
of
the
cultivated
plants
which
are
developments
of
the
monocotyledon
grasses
we
see
therefore
in
the
geological
record
a
confirmation
of
the
evolution
over
immense
periods
of
time
of
the
more
complex
and
perfect
from
the
simple
and
primitive
if
we
turn
to
the
same
geological
record
to
trace
the
development
of
animal
life
we
find
it
running
a
parallel
course
with
that
of
plants
the
earliest
known
fossil
the
eozoon
canadiense
from
the
lower
laurentian
is
that
of
the
chambered
shell
of
a
protista
of
the
class
of
rhizopods
whose
soft
body
consists
of
mere
protoplasm
which
has
not
yet
differentiated
into
cells
as
we
ascend
the
scale
of
the
primordial
era
traces
of
marine
life
of
the
lower
organisms
begin
to
appear
until
in
the
silurian
they
become
very
abundant
consisting
however
mainly
of
mollusca
and
crustacea
and
in
the
upper
silurian
we
find
the
first
traces
of
fishes
in
the
primary
era
the
devonian
and
permian
formations
are
characterised
by
a
great
abundance
of
fishes
of
the
antique
type
which
has
no
true
bony
skeleton
but
is
clothed
in
an
armour
of
enamelled
scales
and
whose
tail
instead
of
being
or
forked
has
one
lobe
type
of
which
the
sturgeon
and
garpike
are
the
nearest
surviving
representatives
in
the
coal
formation
are
found
the
first
remains
of
land
animals
in
the
form
of
insects
and
a
scorpion
and
a
few
traces
of
vertebrate
amphibious
animals
and
reptiles
while
higher
up
in
the
permian
are
found
a
few
more
highly
developed
reptiles
some
of
which
approximate
to
the
existing
crocodile
still
fishes
greatly
predominate
so
that
the
whole
primary
period
may
be
called
the
age
of
fishes
as
truly
as
looking
at
its
flora
it
may
be
called
the
age
of
ferns
in
the
secondary
period
reptiles
predominate
and
are
developed
into
a
great
variety
of
strange
and
colossal
forms
the
first
birds
appear
being
obviously
developed
from
some
of
the
forms
of
flying
lizards
and
having
many
reptilian
characters
mammals
also
put
in
a
first
feeble
appearance
in
the
form
of
small
marsupial
insectivorous
creatures
in
the
tertiary
period
the
class
of
mammals
greatly
predominates
over
all
other
vertebrate
animals
and
we
can
see
the
principal
types
slowly
developing
and
differentiating
into
those
at
present
existing
the
human
type
appears
plainly
in
the
middle
miocene
in
the
form
of
a
large
anthropoid
ape
the
dryopithecus
and
undoubted
human
remains
are
found
in
the
beginning
of
the
quaternary
if
not
as
many
distinguished
geologists
believe
in
the
pliocene
and
even
in
the
miocene
ages
so
far
therefore
there
seems
to
be
a
complete
parallelism
between
the
evolution
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
from
the
earliest
to
the
latest
and
from
the
simplest
to
the
most
complex
forms
these
facts
point
strongly
to
a
process
of
evolution
by
which
the
animal
and
vegetable
worlds
starting
from
a
common
origin
in
protoplasm
the
lowest
and
simplest
form
of
living
matter
have
gradually
advanced
step
by
step
along
diverging
lines
until
we
have
at
last
arrived
at
the
sharp
antithesis
of
the
ox
and
the
oak
tree
it
is
clear
however
that
this
evolution
has
gone
on
under
what
i
have
called
the
generalised
law
of
polarity
by
which
contrasts
are
produced
of
apparently
opposite
and
antagonistic
qualities
which
however
are
indispensable
for
each
existence
thus
animals
could
not
exist
without
plants
to
work
up
the
crude
inorganic
materials
into
the
complex
and
mobile
molecules
of
protoplasm
which
are
alone
suited
for
assimilation
by
the
more
delicate
and
complex
organisation
of
animal
life
plants
on
the
other
hand
could
not
exist
without
a
supply
of
the
carbonic
dioxide
which
is
their
principal
food
and
which
animals
are
continually
pouring
into
the
air
from
the
combustion
of
their
carbonised
food
in
oxygen
which
supplies
them
with
heat
and
energy
thus
nature
is
one
huge
aquarium
in
which
animal
and
vegetable
life
balance
each
other
by
their
contrasted
and
supplemental
action
and
as
in
the
inorganic
world
harmonious
existence
becomes
possible
by
this
due
balance
of
opposing
factors

does
this

we
are
taught
to
repeat
not

is

the

a
curious
instance
of
atavism
or
the
way
in
which
the

of
remote

sometimes
crop
up
in
their

science
however
makes
sad
havoc
with
this
impression
of
sexual
generation
being
the
original
and
only
mode
of
reproduction
and
the
microscope
and
dissecting

of
the

introduce
us
to
new

unsuspected
worlds
of

by

the
larger
proportion
of
living
forms
in

at
any
rate
if
not
in

have
come
into
existence
without
the
aid
of
sexual
propagation
when
we
begin
at
the
beginning
or
with
those
monera
which
are
simple
specks
of
homogeneous
protoplasm
we
find
them
multiplying

and

the

grow

and
then
repeat
the
process
of
splitting
and
duplicating
themselves
the
next
earliest
stage
in
the
evolution
of
living

the
nucleated
cell
does
exactly
the
same
thing
the
nucleus
splits
into
two
each
of
which
becomes
a
new
nucleus
for
the
protoplasmic
matter
of
the
original
cell
and
either
multiply
within
it
or
burst
the
old
and
become
two
new
cells
resembling
the
first
the
next
stage
in
advance
is
that
of
propagation
by
germs
or
buds
in
which
the
organism
does
not
divide
into
two
equal
parts
but
a
small
portion
of
it
swells
out
at
its
surface
and
finally
parts
company
and
starts
on
a
separate
existence
which
grows
to
the
size
of
the
parent
by
its
inherent
faculty
of
manufacturing
fresh
protoplasm
from
surrounding
inorganic
materials
this
process
may
be
witnessed
any
day
in
an
aquarium
containing
specimens
of
the
where
the
minute
new
anemones
may
be
seen
in
every
form
both
before
and
after
they
have
parted
from
the
parent
body
it
remains
one
of
the
principal
modes
of
propagation
of
the
vegetable
world
where
plants
are
multiplied
from
buds
even
after
they
have
developed
the
higher
mode
of
sexual
propagation
by
seeds
in
some
of
the
lowest
animals
such
as
worms
the
buds
are
reduced
to
a
small
aggregation
of
cells
which
form
themselves
into
distinct
individuals
inside
the
body
of
the
parent
and
separate
from
it
when
they
have
attained
a
certain
stage
of
development
advancing
still
further
on
the
road
towards
sexual
reproduction
we
find
these
reduced
to
spores
or
single
cells
which
are
emitted
from
the
parent
and
afterwards
multiply
by
division
until
they
form
a
organism
which
has
the
hereditary
qualities
of
the
original
one
this
is
the
general
form
of
propagation
of
the
lower
plants
such
as
alg√¶
mosses
and
ferns
and
also
of
a
number
of

in

potato
crop
of
a
whole
district
or
bring
about
an
epidemic
of
or
cholera
they
have
their
use
however
in
creation
and
their
action
is
beneficent
as
well
as
the
reverse
for
they
are
the
principal
cause
of
putrefaction
the
process
by
which
the
dead
organic
matter
which
if
not
removed
would
choke
up
the
world
is
resolved
into
the
inorganic
elements
from
which
it
sprang
and
rendered
available
for
fresh
combinations
we
are
now
at
the
threshold
of
that
system
of
sexual
propagation
which
has
become
the
rule
in
all
the
higher
families
of
animals
and
in
many
plants
it
may
be
conceived
as
originating
in
the
amalgamation
of
some
or
spore
with
the
original
cell
which
was
about
to
develop
into
a
within
the
body
of
some
individual
and
by
the
union
of
the
two
producing
a
new
and
more
vigorous
originating
cell
which
modified
the
course
of
development
of
the
and
of
its
resulting
organism
this
organism
having
advantages
in
the
struggle
for
life
established
itself
permanently
with
ever
new
developments
in
the
same
direction
which
would
be
fixed
and
extended
in
its
descendants
by
heredity
and
special
organs
developed
to
meet
the
altered
conditions
thus
at
length
the
distinction
would
be
firmly
established
of
a
female
organ
or
ovary
containing
the
egg
or
primitive
cell
from
which
the
new
being
was
to
be
developed
and
a
male
organ
supplying
the
fertilising
spore
or
cell
which
was
necessary
to
start
the
egg
in
the
evolutionary
process
by
which
it
developed
into
the
germ
of
an
offspring
combining
qualities
of
the
two
parents
this
is
confirmed
by
a
study
of
embryology
which
shows
that
in
the
human
and
higher
animal
species
the
distinction
of
sex
is
not
developed
until
a
considerable
progress
has
been
made
in
the
growth
of
the
embryo
it
is
only
however
in
the
higher
and
more
specialised
families
that
we
find
this
mode
of
propagation
by
two
distinct
individuals
of
different
sexes
firmly
established
in
the
great
majority
of
plants
and
in
some
of
the
lower
families
of
instance
snails
and
male
and
female
organs
are
developed
within
the
same
being
and
they
are
what
is
called
hermaphrodites
thus
in
most
of
the
flowering
plants
the
same
blossom
contains
both
the
stamens
and
anther
which
are
the
male
organ
and
the
style
and
germ
which
are
the
female
another
transition
form
is
parthenogenesis
or
virginal
reproduction
in
which
apparently
similar
in
all
respects
to
develop
themselves
into
new
individuals
without
any
fructifying
element
this
is
found
to
be
the
case
with
many
species
of
insects
and
with
this
curious
result
that
those
same
are
often
capable
of
being
fructified
and
in
that
case
produce
very
different
individuals
thus
among
the
common
bees
male
bees
or
drones
arise
from
the
eggs
of
the
queen
bee
while
females
are
produced
if
the
egg
has
been
fructified
in
the
higher
families
however
of
animal
life
the
distinction
of
sex
in
different
individuals
has
become
the
universal
rule
and
it
produces
a
polarity
or
contrast
which
becomes
ever
more
conspicuous
as
we
rise
in
the
scale
of
creation
until
it
attains
its
highest
development
in
the
highest
stage
hitherto
reached
that
of
civilised
man
and
woman
both
physical
and
mental
characteristics
depend
mainly
on
the
fact
that
the
ovary
or
organ
is
developed
in
the
female
and
thus
the
whole
work
of
reproduction
is
thrown
on
her
to
perform
this
a
large
portion
of
the
vital
energy
is
required
which
in
the
male
is
available
for
larger
and
more
prolonged
growth
of
organs
such
as
the
brain
stature
and
limbs
by
which
a
more
powerful
grasp
is
attained
of
the
outward
environment
in
other
words
the
female
comes
sooner
to
maturity
and
is
weaker
than
the
male
she
is
also
animated
by
a
much
stronger
love
for
the
offspring
which
is
part
of
her
own
body
during
the
period
of
infancy
and
thus
in
addition
to
the
physical
attributes
such
as
lacteal
glands
and
larger
breasts
she
inherits
qualities
of
softness
amiability
and
devotion
which
fit
her
for
the
office
of
nurse
her
physical
weakness
again
has
made
her
for
untold
ages
and
even
now
in
all
the
less
advanced
communities
and
too
often
even
in
the
most
advanced
the
slave
of
the
stronger
male
she
has
thus
inherited
many
of
the
mental
qualities
which
are
essential
to
such
a
state
the
desire
to
propitiate
by
pleasing
and
making
herself
attractive
the
gentleness
and
submissiveness
which
shrink
from
a
contest
of
brute
force
in
which
she
is
sure
to
be
defeated
the
clinging
to
a
stronger
nature
for
support
which
in
extreme
cases
leads
to
blind
admiration
of
power
and
the
attachment
to
a
master
whether
deserving
of
it
or
not
as
civilisation
however
advances
and
as
intellectual
and
moral
qualities
gain
ascendency
over
brute
strength
and
animal
instincts
the
condition
of
woman
improves
and
it
comes
more
and
more
to
be
recognised
that
she
is
not
made
to
be
slave
or
plaything
but
has
her
own
personality
and
character
which
if
in
some
respects
inferior
are
in
others
better
than
those
of
the
male
half
of
creation
tennyson
the
great
poet
of
modern
thought
who
sums
up
so
many
of
the
ideas
and
tendencies
of
the
age
in
concise
and
vigorous
verse
writes
for
woman
is
not
undeveloped
man
nor
yet
opposite
not
opposite
yet
different
so
that
the
one
supplements
what
is
wanting
to
the
other
and
the
harmonious
union
of
the
two
makes
ideal
perfection
it
is
the
glory
of
european
civilisation
to
have
done
so
much
to
develop
this
idea
of
the
equality
of
the
sexes
and
to
have
gone
so
far
towards
emancipating
the
weaker
half
of
the
human
species
from
the
tyranny
of
the
stronger
half
it
would
be
unfair
to
omit
mention
of
the
great
part
which
christianity
has
had
in
this
good
work
not
only
by
direct
precept
and
recognition
of
religious
equality
but
even
more
by
the
embodiment
as
its
ideal
of
the
feminine
virtues
of
gentleness
humility
resignation
and
charity
ideal
christianity
is
in
fact
what
may
be
called
the
feminine
pole
of
conduct
and
morality
as
opposed
to
the
masculine
one
of
courage
hardihood
energy
and
many
of
the
precepts
of
christianity
are
unworkable
and
have
to
be
silently
dropped
in
practice
it
would
not
answer
either
for
individuals
or
nations
smitten
on
one
cheek
to
turn
the
when
an
appeal
is
made
to
to
decide
whether
it
is
a
right
rule
to
live
as
the
sparrows
do
taking
no
thought
for
the
morrow
the
verdict
of
is
in
favour
of
foresight
and
frugality
herbert
spencer
has
stated
this
polarity
very
strongly
as
that
of
the
religion
of
amity
and
the
religion
of
enmity
but
i
think
he
states
the
case
too
adversely
for
the
latter
for
the
qualities
which
make
men
and
nations
good
fighters
and
victorious
in
the
struggle
for
existence
are
in
their
way
just
as
essential
as
the
gentler
virtues
and
both
alike
become
defects
when
pushed
to
the
of
christianity
therefore
whatever
may
become
of
its
dogmas
ought
always
to
be
regarded
with
affection
and
respect
for
the
humanising
effect
it
has
produced
especially
in
improving
the
condition
of
the
female
half
of
creation
this
improvement
in
the
condition
of
women
has
brought
about
a
corresponding
improvement
in
the
male
sex
for
the
polarity
between
the
two
has
come
to
be
the
most
intimate
and
influence
of
modern
life
take
the
literature
of
the
novel
and
play
which
aim
at
holding
up
the
mirror
to
human
nature
and
contemporary
manners
and
you
will
find
that
they
nearly
all
turn
upon
love
the
word
has
come
to
signify
the
one
particular
breach
of
the
laws
of
morality
which
arises
from
the
relations
of
the
sexes
in
providing
for
the
birth
of
nearly
equal
numbers
of
each
sex
nature
clearly
establishes
monogamy
or
union
of
single
pairs
as
the
condition
of
things
most
in
accordance
with
natural
laws
the
family
also
the
first
germ
of
civilisation
is
impossible
or
can
only
exist
in
a
very
imperfect
and
state
without
this
permanent
union
of
a
single
husband
and
wife
violations
of
this
law
lead
to
such
disastrous
consequences
to
individuals
and
are
so
deteriorating
to
nations
that
they
are
properly
considered
as
the
and
condemned
by
all
opinion
and
yet
to
observe
this
law
is
a
constant
lesson
in
for
a
great
part
of
the
life
a
lesson
of
the
utmost
value
for
it
is
a
virtue
which
is
at
the
root
of
all
other
virtues
and
it
is
formed
and
becomes
habitual
and
easy
by
practice
for
just
as
the
muscles
of
the
leg
or
arm
acquire
strength
and
elasticity
by
use
so
do
the
finer
fibres
of
the
brain
improve
by
exercise
and
become
soft
and
flabby
by
disuse
so
that
effort
in
the
former
case
is
a
pleasure
and
in
the
latter
a
pain
for
this
reason

generally

of
the
position
which
either
an
individual
a

a

hold
in
the
scale

than
the
tone
which
prevails
among

wherever

prevail
we
may
be
sure
that
whatever
may
be
the
outward
varnish
of
manner
there
is
essential
snobbishness
up
and
down
along

of

gentleman
beats
though
it
be
under
the
rough
exterior
of
one
of
bret
or

miners
nothing
in
fact
gives
one
more
hope
in
the
progress
of
human
society
than
to
find
that
in
the
freest
countries
and
those
farthest
advanced
towards
modern
ideas
and
democratic
institutions
the
tone
with
regard
to
women
shows
the
greatest
improvement
there
is
a
regular
scale
of
progress
from
turkey
to
america
i
do
not
refer
so
much
to
the
fact
that
in
the
newer
colonies
and
countries
women
can
travel
unprotected
without
fear
of
insult
or
injury
as
to
the
almost
instinctive
recognition
of
their
equal
rights
as
intelligent
and
moral
beings
who
have
a
personality
and
character
of
their
own
which
places
them
on
the
same
platform
as
men
though
on
opposite
sides
of
it
to
understand
rightly
the
real
spirit
of
an
age
or
country
it
is
not
enough
to
study
dry
statistics
or
history
in
the
form
of
records
of
wars
and
political
changes
we
must
study
the
works
of
the
best
poets
novelists
and
dramatists
who
seek
to
embody
types
and
to
hold
up
the
mirror
to
contemporary
ideas
and
manners
a
careful
perusal
of
such
works
as
those
of
dickens
thackeray
trollope
and
george
eliot
at
home
and
of
bret
harte
howells
james
and
burnett
in
the
united
states
will
give
a
truer
insight
into
the
inner
life
of
the
country
and
period
than
any
number
of
or
consular
returns
they
show
what
the
writers
of
the
greatest
genius
that
is
of
the
greatest
insight
see
as
types
of
the
actual
ideas
and
characters
surrounding
them
and
the
fact
of
their
works
being
popular
shows
that
the
types
are
recognised
as
true
now
it
is
certain
that
the
english
literature
of
fiction
and
its
latest
development
that
of
the
american
novelists
show
an
recognition
of
the
female
individual
as
an
equal
unit
with
the
male
in
the
constitution
of
modern
society
those
dear
of
bret
and
wendell
who
career
so
joyously
through
mining
camps
receiving
courtesy
and
radiating
civilising
influences
among
the
rough
inhabitants
or
touch
the
hearts
and
throw
a
mellow
light
over
the
autumn
days
of
professors
and
philosophers
are
far
removed
from
the
slaves
of
prehistoric
savages
or
the
inmates
of
a
turkish
harem
so
also
in
the
more
complex
relations
of
a
more
crowded
civilisation
in
the
circles
of
washington
new
york
and
boston
the
ideal
american
woman
is
always
depicted
as
bright
intelligent
and
independent
with
a
character
and
personality
of
her
own
and
the
suspicion
never
seems
to
enter
the
head
that
she
is
in
any
respect
inferior
to
the
male
characters
with
whom
she
is
associated
the
same
may
be
said
to
a
great
extent
of
english
literature
from
the
time
of
shakespeare
downwards
no
better
portrait
than
portia
was
ever
drawn
of
the
perfect
woman
nobly
planned
to
soothe
to
comfort
and
command
and
yet
a
spirit
still
and
bright
with
something
of
an
angel
light
and
in
the
long
gallery
of
good
and
loveable
women
from
rosalind
and
imogene
down
to
lucy
roberts
and
laura
pendennis
we
have
not
one
who
is
a
mere
or
child
of
passionate
impulse
nor
is
the
recognition
of
equality
less
marked
in
the
bad
characters
lady
macbeth
is
of
a
stronger
nature
than
macbeth
becky
sharp
more
clever
and
full
of
resources
than
the
men
with
whom
she
plays
like
puppets
maggie
tulliver
with
all
her
wild
struggles
with
herself
and
her
surroundings
has
far
more
in
her
than
her
brother
tom
compare
these
characters
with
those
of
the
school
of
modern
french
novels
which
turn
mainly
on
adultery
and
seduction
committed
for
the
most
part
not
in
any
whirlwind
of
irresistible
passion
but
to
gratify
some
passing
caprice
or
vanity
and
it
is
easy
to
see
how
wide
is
the
gulf
which
separates
the
ideals
and
moral
atmosphere
of
the
two
countries
it
is
not
therefore
from
any
wish
to
indulge
in
what
herbert
spencer
calls
the
bias
and
depreciate
my
own
country
that
i
am
disposed
to
think
that
the
younger
communities
are
somewhat
in
advance
of
ourselves
in
this
matter
of
the
relations
of
the
sexes
but
simply
because
i
think
that
the
feeling
is
there
more
widespread
and
universal
we
have
in
english
society
two
strata
in
which
women
are
still
considered
as
inferior
beings
to
men
a
lower
one
where
better
ideas
have
not
yet
permeated
the
dense
mass
of
ignorance
and
brutality
and
a
higher
one
where
among
a
certain
portion
let
us
hope
a
small
one
of
the
gilded
youth
and
upper
ten
luxury
and
idleness
have
blunted
the
finer
susceptibilities
and
created
what
may
be
most
aptly
called
a
turkish
tone
about
women
there
are
many
of
this
class
and
unfortunately
often
in
high
places
where
their
example
does
widespread
mischief
whose
ideal
might
be
summed
up
in
the
words
of
the
irish
ballad
i
am
one
of
the
ould
sort
of
bradies
my
turn
does
not
lie
to
hard
work
but
fond
of
my
pipe
and
the
ladies
and
make
a
most
illigant
turk
and
most
they
make
though
far
worse
than
real
turks
who
are
born
and
brought
up
in
the
ideas
and
surroundings
of
a
lower
civilisation
while
the
tone
of
our
english
turks
is
far
more
nauseous
and
disgusting
as
denoting
innate
selfishness
sensuality
and
vulgarity
of
these
two
classes
there
seem
to
be
fewer
in
the
newer
english
communities
and
if
they
exist
they
are
in
such
a
small
minority
that
they
conceal
their
existence
and
pay
the
homage
of
vice
to
virtue
which
is
called
hypocrisy
to
return
however
to
the
more
scientific
aspects
of
the
question
the
polarity
of
sex
displays
itself
as
conspicuously
as
that
of
the
magnet
in
the
fundamental
law
of
repulsion
of
like
for
like
and
attraction
of
like
for
unlike
in
each
case
there
must
be
an
identity
of
essence
developing
itself
in
opposite
directions
thus
atoms
attract
or
repel
atoms
but
not
molecules
for
if
they
seem
to
do
so
it
is
only
in
cases
in
which
the
molecule
contains
some
atom
whose
atomicity
or
polar
power
has
not
been
fully
satisfied
so
currents
of
air
or
water
do
not
affect
electric
currents
but
given
the
identity
of
substance
its
differentiation
takes
place
under
an
progression
of
polarity
of
affinities
and
repulsions

naturalist
brahm
discussing
the
question
why
birds
sing
says
male
finds
in
the
female
those
desirable
and
attractive
qualities
which
are
wanting
in
himself
he
seeks
the
opposite
to
himself
with
the
force
of
a
chemical
this
is
equally
true
of
the
male
and
female
of
the
human
species
a
masculine
woman
and
effeminate
man
are
equally
unattractive
and
if
the
qualities
are
pushed
to
an
extreme
extent
the
individuals
become
monstrosities
and
instead
of
attracting
excite
vehement
disgust
and
repulsion
this
which
is
true
physically
is
equally
true
of
moral
and
intellectual
characteristics
each
seeks
in
the
happy
marriage
or
perfect
ideal
union
the
qualities
which
are
most
deficient
in
themselves
the
woman
strength
active
courage
and
the
harder
qualities
the
man
gentleness
amiability
and
the
softer
virtues
in
each
individual
as
in
each
union
of
individuals
harmony
and
perfection
depend
on
the
due
balance
of
the
opposite
qualities
and
the
of
leads
up
to
chaos
and
insanity
the
man
in
whom
strength
and
hardihood
are
not
tempered
by
gentleness
and
affection
becomes
brutal
and
tyrannical
while
the
woman
who
has
no
strength
of
character
becomes
silly
and
frivolous
marriage
however
involves
the
highest
ideal
for
the
union
of
the
two
in
one
gives
a
more
complete
harmony
and
reconciliation
of
opposites
than
can
be
attained
by
the
single
individual
who
must
always
remain
more
or
less
within
the
sphere
of
the
polarity
of
his
or
her
respective
sex
but
here
also
the
same
law
of
polarity
operates
for
as
happy
marriage
affords
the
highest
ideal
so
do
unhappy
and
unions
involve
the
greatest
misery
and
most
complete
shipwreck
of
life
especially
to
the
woman
for
the
man
has
other
pursuits
and
occupations
and
can
to
a
great
extent
withdraw
himself
from
domestic
troubles
while
the
woman
has
no
defence
against
the
coarseness
selfishness
and
vulgarity
of
the
partner
to
whom
she
is
tied
and
who
may
make
her
life
a
perpetual
purgatory
and
drag
all
her
finer
intellectual
and
moral
nature
down
to
a
lower
level
fortunately
extreme
cases
are
rare
and
though
the
ideal
of
a
perfect
union
may
seldom
be
attained
to
the
great
majority
of
married
couples
manage
to
jog
on
together
and
bring
up
families
in
comparative
comfort
and
respectability
evidently
however
in
many
cases
the
weaker
party
does
not
get
fair
play
and
the
laws
which
are
the
result
of
centuries
of
male
legislation
are
often
too
oblivious
of
the
maxim
that
what
is
for
goose
is
sauce
for
improvement
however
is
coming
from
the
growth
of
the
more
healthy
public
opinion
which
stigmatises
any
invasion
of
real
rights
and
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
her
natural
protector
to
bully
and
tyrannise
as
utterly
disgraceful
and
the
waves
of
this
public
opinion
are
slowly
but
surely
sapping
the
cliffs
of
legal
conservatism
and

in

of

how
by

of

of
the
triton
in
individuals
and
into
as
the
earth
is
kept
in
an
orbit
which
makes
life
possible
by
the
balance
of
the
antagonist
centripetal
and
centrifugal
forces
so
is
that
life
evolved
and
maintained
by
the
balance
of
the
two
conflicting
forces
of
heredity
and
variation
heredity
or
the
principle
which
makes
offsprings
resemble
their
parental
organisms
may
be
considered
as
the
centripetal
force
which
gives
stability
to
species
while
variation
is
like
the
centrifugal
force
which
tends
to
make
them
develop
into
new
forms
and
prevents
organic
matter
from
remaining
ever
consolidated
into
one
uniform
mass
as
regards
heredity
the
considerations
which
have
been
advanced
in
the
last
chapter
on
the
origin
of
sex
will
enable
the
reader
to
understand
the
principles
on
which
it
is
based
when
a
moneron
or
living
piece
of
pure
protoplasm
or
its
successor
the
nucleated
cell
propagates
itself
by
simple
division
into
two
equal
parts
it
is
obvious
that
each
half
must
in
its
atomic
constitution
and
motions
exactly
resemble
the
original
if
am≈ìba
a
divides
into
am≈ìb√¶
b
and
c
both
b
and
c
are
exact
facsimiles
of
a
and
of
one
another
and
so
are
the
progeny
of
b
and
c
through
any
number
of
generations
they
must
remain
identical
repetitions
of
the
parent
form
unless
some
of
them
should
happen
to
be
modified
by
different
actions
of
their
surrounding
environment
powerful
enough
to
affect
the
original
organisation
in
propagation
by
germs
or
buds
the
same
thing
must
hold
true
only
as
the
offspring
carries
with
it
not
the
half
but
only
a
small
portion
of
the
parental
organism
its
impress
will
be
less
powerful
and
the
new
organism
will
more
readily
be
affected
by
external
influences
when
we
come
to
propagation
by
spores
or
single
cells
and
still
more
to
sexual
propagation
by
the
union
of
single
cells
of
two
progenitors
it
becomes
more
difficult
to
see
how
the
type
of
the
two
parents
and
of
a
long
line
of
preceding
ancestors
can
be
maintained
so
perfectly
of
the
fact
that
it
is
maintained
there
can
be
no
doubt
not
only
do
species
breed
true
and
remain
substantially
the
same
for
immense
periods
but
the
characters
of
individual
parents
and
their
ancestors
repeat
themselves
to
a
great
extent
in
their
offspring
thus
the
cross
between
the
white
and
black
varieties
of
the
human
species
perpetuates
itself
to
such
an
extent
that
a
single
cross
of
black
blood
leaves
traces
for
a
number
of
generations
in
the
spanish
american
states
and
the
west
indies
where
the
distinction
is
closely
observed
the
term
is
well
known
as
applied
to
creoles
who
have
of
white
to
of
black
blood
in
their
composition
in
the
case
of
what
is
called
this
recurrence
to
the
characters
of
ancestors
is
carried
to
a
much
further
extent
in
breeding
animals
it
is
not
uncommon
to
find
the
peculiar
features
of
generations
of
ancestors
long
since
extinct
cropping
up
occasionally
in
individuals
thus
stripes
like
those
of
the
ass
along
the
back
and
down
the
shoulders
occasionally
appear
on
horses
whose
immediate
ancestors
for
many
generations
back
showed
nothing
of
the
sort
and
even
stripes
across
the
legs
like
those
of
the
zebra
occur
quite
unexpectedly
and
testify
to
the
common
descent
of
the
various
species
of
the
horse
tribe
from
a
striped
ancestor
how
these
ancestral
peculiarities
can
be
transmitted
through
many
generations
each
individual
of
which
originated
from
a
single
microscopic
cell
which
had
been
fructified
by
another
cell
is
one
of
the
greatest
mysteries
of
nature
it
may
assist
us
in
forming
some
idea
of
the
possibility
of
a
solution
to
remember
what
has
been
proved
as
to
the
dimensions
of
atoms
their
order
of
magnitude
is
that
of
a
to
the
earth
in
a
single
microscopic
cell
therefore
there
may
be
myriads
of
such
atoms
circling
round
one
another
and
forming
infinitesimal
solar
systems
of
infinite
complexity
and
variety
theory
of
supposes
that
some
of
the
actual
identical
atoms
which
formed
part
of
ancestral
bodies
are
thus
transmitted
through
their
descendants
for
generation
after
generation
so
that
we
are
literally
of
the
of
the
prim√¶val
creature
who
was
developed
into
man
in
the
later
tertiary
or
early
glacial
period
haeckel
more
plausibly
suggests
that
not
the
identical
atoms
but
their
peculiar
motions
and
mode
of
aggregation
have
been
thus
transmitted
a
mode
of
transmission
which
with
his
prevailing
tendency
to
invent
long
and
learned
names
for
everything
he
calls
the
of
in
any
case
however
these
must
be
taken
not
as
solutions
of
the
problem
but
as
guesses
at
the
truth
which
show
that
its
solution
is
not
impossible
the
opposite
principle
to
heredity
that
of
variation
is
equally
important
and
universal
it
is
apparent
in
the
fact
that
although
every
individual
of
every
species
reproduces
qualities
of
parents
and
ancestors
no
two
individuals
do
so
in
precisely
the
same
manner
no
two
are
exactly
alike
this
difference
or
individuality
becomes
more
marked
as
the
organism
is
higher
thus
sheep
and
hounds
differ
from
one
another
by
slight
differences
which
require
the
practised
eye
of
the
shepherd
or
huntsman
to
detect
while
human
beings
are
so
unlike
that
of
the
many
millions
existing
in
each
generation
no
two
exactly
resemble
one
another
the
reason
of
this
is
apparent
if
we
consider
that
the
higher
the
organism
the
more
complex
does
it
become
and
the
less
the
chance
of
the
whole
complicated
relations
of
parent
and
ancestral
organisms
being
transmitted
by
single
cells
so
solidly
and
completely
as
to
overpower
and
remain
uninfluenced
by
external
influences
variation
evidently
depends
mainly
on
the
varying
influences
of
environment
if
the
exterior
layer
of
molecules
of
a
lump
of
protoplasm
become
differentiated
from
the
interior
ones
and
form
a
it
is
because
they
are
in
more
immediate
contact
with
the
air
or
other
surrounding
medium
internal
changes
depend
on
conditions
such
as
temperature
and
nutrition
in
the
case
of
cultivated
plants
and
domestic
animals
we
can
see
most
clearly
how
varieties
are
produced
by
adaptation
to
changes
of
environment
these
variations
however
would
not
proceed
very
far
were
it
not
for
the
interaction
of
the
opposing
forces
of
variation
and
heredity
by
which
latter
the
variations
appearing
in
individuals
are
fixed
and
accumulated
in
descendants
until
they
become
wide
and
permanent
divergencies
this
is
done
in
the
case
of
cultivated
plants
and
domestic
animals
by
artificial
selection
in
pairing
individuals
who
show
the
same
variations
and
in
nature
by
the
struggle
for
existence
giving
victory
and
survival
to
those
forms
and
in
the
long
run
to
those
forms
only
whose
variations
slight
as
they
may
be
in
each
generation
tend
to
bring
individuals
into
better
adaptation
to
their
environment
it
is
the
great
glory
of
darwin
to
have
established
this
firmly
by
an
immense
number
of
interesting
and
exhaustive
instances
and
thus
placed
evolution
or
a
scientific
explanation
of
the
development
and
laws
of
life
on
a
solid
basis
every
day
fresh
discoveries
and
experiments
confirm
this
great
principle
and
it
has
almost
passed
into
the
same
phase
as
law
of
gravity
as
a
fundamental
law
accepted
as
axiomatic
by
all
men
of
science
and
as
the
basis
of
modern
thought
to
which
all
religions
and
philosophies
have
to
conform
accepted
by
nearly
all
modern
thinkers
i
may
here
quote
a
passage
from
an
eminent
anglican
divine
temple
for
the
double
purpose
of
showing
how
universal
has
become
the
acceptance
of
this
darwinian
view
of
evolution
among
intelligent
men
and
how
little
terrible
are
its
consequences
even
to
those
who
look
at
the
facts
of
the
universe
through
a
theological
medium
and
retain
their
belief
in
accepted
creeds
seems
in
itself
something
more
majestic
more
befitting
of
him
to
whom
a
thousand
years
are
as
one
day
and
one
day
as
a
thousand
years
thus
to
impress
his
will
once
for
all
on
this
creation
and
provide
for
all
its
countless
varieties
by
this
one
original
impress
than
by
special
acts
of
creation
to
be
perpetually
modifying
what
he
had
previously
temple
and
scientific
men
would
be
content
to
accept
this
statement
of
almost
in
his
own
words
except
that
they
might
consider
his
definition
of
the
great
first
cause
as
somewhat
too
absolute
and
confident
having
had
to
deal
so
much
with
actual
facts
and
accurate
knowledge
they
are
apt
to
be
more
modest
in
assertion
than
even
the
most
enlightened
theologian
whose
studies
have
lain
rather
in
the
direction
of
phrases
and
ideas
which
from
their
very
nature
are
more
vague
and
indefinite
and
perhaps
rather
guesses
and
aspirations
after
truth
than
proofs
of
it
in
any
case
there
is
the
authority
of
a
learned
and
bishop
for
the
position
that
the
scientific
way
of
looking
at
the
universe
is
not
necessarily
profane
or
irreligious
to
return
to
variation
the
instances
of
the
operation
of
this
principle
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
that
of
heredity
in
working
out
the
evolution
of
species
are
exceedingly
numerous
and
interesting
those
who
wish
to
understand
the
subject
thoroughly
must
study
the
works
of
darwin
haeckel
huxley
and
other
modern
writers
but
for
my
present
purpose
it
will
be
sufficient
to
refer
to
a
few
of
the
most
marked
instances
which
may
assist
the
reader
in
comprehending
how
the
gradual
evolution
of
life
and
creation
of
new
species
may
have
been
brought
about
there
is
an
amphibious
animal
called
the
triton
or
akin
to
the
frog
whose
normal
course
is
to
begin
life
living
in
the
water
and
breathing
by
gills
and
end
it
on
land
with
gills
metamorphosed
into
lungs
if
they
are
shut
up
in
water
and
kept
in
a
tank
they
never
lose
their
gills
but
continue
through
life
in
the
lower
stage
of
development
and
reproduce
themselves
in
other
tritons
with
gills
conversely
the
axolotl
a
peculiar
gilled
salamander
from
the
lake
of
mexico
has
its
normal
course
to
live
die
and
propagate
its
species
in
water
breathing
by
gills
but
if
an
axolotl
happens
to
stray
from
the
water
and
take
to
living
on
dry
land
the
gills
are
modified
into
lungs
and
the
animal
gains
a
place
in
the
class
in
the
school
of
development
this
fits
in
remarkably
with
the
fact
that
the
embryo
of
all
vertebrate
mammals
including
man
passes
through
the
gilled
stage
before
arriving
at
the
development
of
lungs
which
assists
us
in
understanding
two
facts
of
primary
importance
in
the
history
of
evolution
first
how
terrestrial
life
may
have
arisen
from
aquatic
life
by
adaptation
to
altered
conditions
secondly
how
the
evolution
of
the
embryo
sums
up
in
the
individual
in
the
period
of
a
few
days
or
months
the
various
stages
of
evolutions
which
it
has
taken
millions
of
years
to
accomplish
in
the
species
as
a
parallel
to
the
transformation
of
gills
into
lungs
and
of
an
aquatic
into
a
land
animal
if
we
turn
to
the
geological
records
of
the
secondary
period
we
may
trace
the
transformation
of
a
water
into
an
air
population
of
into
and
of
into
birds
the
is
an
actual
specimen
of
the
transition
being
a
feathered
lizard
or
rather
winged
and
feathered
creature
which
is
half
lizard
and
half
bird
a
remarkable
instance
of
the
great
change
of
functions
which
may
be
produced
by
a
change
of
outward
conditions
is
afforded
by
the
common
ringed
snake
which
in
its
natural
state
lays
eggs
which
take
three
weeks
to
hatch
but
if
confined
in
a
cage
in
which
no
sand
is
strewed
it
hatches
the
eggs
within
its
own
body
and
from
oviparous
becomes
viviparous
this
may
help
us
to
understand
how
the
lowest
order
of
mammals
which
like
the
australian
echidna
or
mole
lay
eggs
may
have
developed
first
into
marsupial
and
finally
into
placental
mammals
these
examples
may
assist
the
reader
in
understanding
how
the
infinite
diversities
of
living
species
may
have
been
developed
in
the
course
of
evolution
from
simple
origins
just
as
the
inorganic
world
was
from
atoms
by
the
action
and
reaction
of
primitive
polar
forces
between
the
organism
and
its
environment
and
between
heredity
and
variation

it

to

of
the

separates

the

without

how
these
impressions
are
made
in
all
ordinary
cases
they
are
made
through
the
channels
of
the
senses
but
it
is
possible
that
in
certain
exceptional
cases
vibrations
in
the
brain
causing
perceptions
may
be
conveyed
to
it
through
the
nerves
in
other
ways
in
somnambulism
for
instance
it
seems
to
be
an
ascertained
fact
that
a
somnambulist
with
closed
eyes
securely
bandaged
can
walk
in
the
dark
and
avoid
obstacles
as
well
as
if
guided
by
the
sight
in
full
daylight
there
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence
also
that
in
artificial
somnambulism
otherwise
called
mesmerism
or
hypnotism
and
also
in
what
is
called
perceptions
may
be
conveyed
from
one
brain
to
another
otherwise
than
by
the
usual
methods
of
speech
or
writing
but
these
phenomena
however
far
they
may
be
extended
do
not
affect
the
position
that
impressions
on
the
brain
are
the
essential
condition
of
thought
if
the
grey
matter
of
the
brain
is
deficient
or
diseased
the
mind
is
affected
and
beyond
a
certain
point
becomes
extinct
the
second
and
more
important
reservation
is
that
although
mind
and
all
its
qualities
are
thus
indissolubly
connected
with
matter
it
by
no
means
follows
that
they
are
matter
or
mere
qualities
of
it
in
the
case
of
the
atoms
and
energies
we
know
absolutely
nothing
of
their
real
essence
and
can
not
form
even
a
conception
of
what
they
are
how
they
came
there
or
what
will
become
of
them
it
is
the
same
with
mind
soul
or
self
we
feel
an
instinctive
certainty
of
their
existence
as
we
do
of
that
of
matter
and
we
can
trace
their
laws
and
manifestations
under
the
conditions
in
which
they
are
known
to
us
viz
those
of
association
with
matter
and
motion
in
the
brain
but
of
their
real
essence
or
existence
we
know
nothing
and
it
is
as
unscientific
to
affirm
as
to
deny
directly
we
pass
beyond
the
boundary
of
such
knowledge
as
really
can
be
known
by
human
faculty
and
stand
face
to
face
with
the
mystery
of
the
great
unknown
we
can
only
bow
our
heads
with
reverence
and
say
with
the
poet
behold
i
know
not
anything
i
hope
thus
to
steer
safely
between
scylla
and
the
arid
rocks
of
materialism
and
the
whirling
eddies
of
spiritualism
materialist
and
spiritualist
seem
to
me
very
like
two
men
disputing
as
to
the
existence
of
life
in
the
sun
argues
the
former
the
known
conditions
there
are
totally
inconsistent
with
any
life
we
can
says
the
other
the
belief
fits
in
with
many
things
which
i
earnestly
wish
to
believe
respecting
a
supreme
being
and
a
future
to
the
first
i
say
ignorance
is
not
evidence
to
the
second
wishes
are
not
proofs
for
myself
while
not
quarrelling
with
those
more
favoured
mortals
who
have
or
fancy
they
have
superior
knowledge
i
can
only
say
that
i
really
know
nothing
and
this
being
the
case
i
see
no
use
in
saying
that
i
know
and
think
it
both
more
truthful
and
more
modest
to
confess
the
limitation
of
my
faculties
with
this
caution
i
return
to
the
field
of
positive
knowledge
the
brain
spinal
marrow
and
nerves
consist
of
two
substances
one
white
which
constitutes
the
great
mass
consisting
of
tubes
or
fibres
the
other
grey
which
is
an
aggregation
of
minute
cells
so
minute
that
it
has
been
computed
that
there
are
several
millions
of
them
in
a
space
no
larger
than
a
sixpence
the
bulk
of
this
grey
is
found
in
the
higher
animals
and
especially
in
man
in
the
outside
rind
which
covers
the
brain
and
its
amount
is
greatly
increased
by
the
convolutions
of
that
organ
giving
a
greater
extent
of
covering
surface
in
fact
the
convolutions
of
the
average
human
brain
give
as
much
grey
matter
in
a
head
of
average
size
as
would
be
given
by
a
head
of
four
times
the
size
if
the
brain
were
a
plane
surface
the
extent
of
the
convolutions
is
therefore
a
sure
sign
of
the
extent
of
intellect
they
are
more
numerous
and
deeper
in
the
european
than
in
the
negro
in
the
negro
than
in
the
chimpanzee
in
the
anthropoid
ape
than
in
the
monkey
or
lemur
this
grey
is
the
organ
by
which
impressions
from
without
are
turned
into
perceptions
volitions
and
evolutions
of
nerve
force
the
white
matter
is
simply
the
medium
of
transmission
or
we
may
say
the
telegraph
wires
by
which
the
impressions
are
conveyed
to
the
head
office
and
the
answers
sent
the
of
the
grey
matter
is
thus
emphatically
the
organ
of
the
mind
in
fact
if
it
did
not
sound
too
materialistic
we
might
call
thought
a
secretion
of
the
grey
matter
only
in
saying
so
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
it
is
only
a
mode
of
expressing
the
fact
that
the
two
invariably
go
together
and
that
if
we
say
with
the
german
philosopher
phosphor
kein
gedank
it
does
not
mean
that
thought
and
phosphorus
are
identical
but
simply
that
the
condition
on
which
thought
depends
is
that
of
the
existence
of
a
material
organ
of
which
phosphorus
is
an
ingredient
that
this
grey
is
really
the
organ
of
thought
has
been
firmly
established
by
numerous
experiments
both
in
man
and
the
lower
animals
injuries
to
it
or
diseases
in
it
invariably
affect
what
is
called
the
mind
while
considerable
portions
of
the
white
matter
may
be
removed
without
affecting
the
thinking
and
perceptive
powers
a
certain
amount
of
it
is
indispensable
for
the
existence
of
intellect
the
more
there
is
of
it
as
the
brain
increases
in
size
and
the
convolutions
become
deeper
the
greater
is
the
intellect
when
these
fall
below
certain
dimensions
intellect
is
extinguished
and
we
have
idiocy
the
average
brain
of
the
male
white
european
weighs
ounces
of
the
negro
a
little
under
the
maximum
brains
which
have
been
accurately
weighed
and
measured
are
those
of
cuvier
and
daniel
webster
the
weight
of
the
former
being
ounces
and
the
capacity
of
the
latter
being
cubic
inches
while
the
average
capacity
of
the
teutonic
race
including
english
germans
and
americans
is
inches
of
the
negro
and
of
the
australian
and
hottentot
the
brain
of
the
idiot
seldom
weighs
over
ounces
and
the
minimum
weight
consistent
with
a
fair
degree
of
intelligence
is
about
ounces
the
mechanism
by
which
correspondence
is
kept
up
between
the
living
individual
and
the
surrounding
universe
is
very
reality
as
simple
as
that
of
any
ordinary
electric
circuit
in
the
most
complex
case
that
of
man
there
are
a
number
of
or
small
lumps
of
protoplasm
embedded
in
the
tissues
all
over
the
body
or
highly
specialised
and
grouped
together
in
separate
organs
such
as
the
eye
and
ear
from
which
a
leads
direct
to
the
brain
or
to
the
spinal
cord
and
so
up
to
the
brain
these
receive
the
different
vibrations
by
which
outward
energy
presents
itself
which
propagate
a
current
or
succession
of
vibrations
of
along
the
this
is
a
round
thread
of
protoplasm
covered
by
a
white
sheath
of
fatty
matter
which
insulates
it
like
the
wire
of
a
submarine
telegraph
coated
with
this
leads
up
to
a
consisting
of
two
corpuscles
of
protoplasm
the
first
or
sensory
a
smaller
one
which
is
connected
by
branches
with
the
second
a
much
larger
one
called
the
motor
from
which
a
much
larger
or
wire
proceeds
which
terminates
in
a
mass
of
protoplasm
firmly
attached
to
a
muscle
thus
a
sensation
is
propagated
along
the
sensory
nerve
to
the
sensory
whence
it
is
transmitted
to
the
which
acts
as
an
accumulator
of
energy
a
large
flow
of
which
is
sent
through
the
large
conductor
of
the
to
the
muscle
which
it
causes
to
contract
and
thus
produces
motion
it
is
thus
that
the
simpler
involuntary
actions
are
produced
by
a
process
which
is
purely
mechanical
in
the
more
complex
cases
in
which
consciousness
and
will
are
involved
the
process
is
essentially
the
same
though
more
complicated
the
message
is
transmitted
to
the
brain
where
it
is
received
by
a
cluster
of
small
sensory
cells
or
which
are
connected
with
another
cluster
of
fewer
and
larger
often
at
some
distance
from
them
by
a
network
of
interlacing
fibres
but
it
is
always
a
case
of
a
single
circuit
of
wires
batteries
and
accumulators
adapted
for
receiving
recording
and
transmitting
one
sort
of
vibrations
caused
by
and
producing
one
sort
of
energy
and
one
only
the
brain
does
not
act
as
a
whole
receiving
indiscriminately
impressions
of
light
sound
and
heat
but
by
separate
organs
for
each
located
in
separate
parts
of
it
it
is
like
a
great
central
office
in
one
room
of
which
you
have
a
printing
instrument
reading
off
and
recording
messages
sent
through
an
electric
telegraph
in
another
a
telephone
in
a
third
a
thermometer
and
so
on
and
the
same
for
the
and
nerves
one
set
is
told
off
to
move
the
muscles
of
the
face
another
those
of
the
arms
others
for
the
legs
and
body
and
so
forth
this
is
further
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
brain
like
the
rest
of
the
body
has
two
sides
a
right
and
left
and
that
in
some
cases
the
is
doubled
each
working
only
on
one
side
while
in
others
the
same
battery
and
wires
serve
for
both
as
a
rule
the
right
hemisphere
of
the
brain
works
the
muscles
of
the
left
side
of
the
body
and
so
that
an
injury
to
one
side
of
the
brain
may
paralyse
the
voluntary
motion
of
the
limbs
on
the
opposite
side
leaving
in
a
perfect
condition
those
on
its
own
side
in
the
case
of
the
higher
functions
involving
thought
the
upper
part
of
the
brain
which
performs
these
functions
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
duplex
machine
so
that
we
have
two
brains
capable
of
thinking
just
as
we
have
two
eyes
capable
of
seeing
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
the
areas
of
the
brain
which
are
appropriated
to
the
lowest
and
most
instinctive
functions
which
appear
first
lie
lowest
and
as
the
functions
rise
the
position
of
their
rises
with
them
thus
at
the
very
base
of
the
frontal
convolutions
at
the
lowest
end
of
the
fissure
of
rolando
we
find
the
motor
areas
for
the
lower
part
of
the
face
by
which
the
lowest
animals
and
the
infant
perform
their
solitary
function
of
sucking
and
swallowing
higher
up
are
the
centres
in
the
right
and
left
brains
for
moving
the
upper
limbs
that
is
for
seizing
food
and
conveying
it
to
the
mouth
which
is
the
next
function
in
the
ascending
scale
next
above
these
are
the
centres
for
moving
the
lower
limbs
and
for
the
motions
of
the
arms
and
legs
marking
the
progression
of
an
organism
which
can
pursue
and
catch
as
well
as
eat
its
food
and
still
higher
are
the
centres
which
regulate
the
motions
of
the
trunk
and
body
in
correspondence
with
those
of
the
limbs
while
highest
of
all
at
the
front
and
hind
ends
of
the
enveloping
cortex
of
the
brain
come
the
organs
of
the
intellectual
faculties
it
is
easy
to
see
that
this
corresponds
with
the
progression
of
the
individual
for
the
infant
sucks
and
cries
for
food
from
the
first
day
soon
learns
to
extend
its
hand
and
grasp
objects
but
takes
some
time
to
learn
to
walk
and
still
longer
to
perform
exercises
like
dancing
or
riding
in
which
the
motions
of
the
whole
body
have
to
be
with
those
of
the
limbs
and
as
the
development
of
the
individual
is
an
epitome
of
the
evolution
of
life
from
protoplasm
we
may
well
suppose
that
the
brain
was
developed
in
this
order
from
its
first
origin
in
a
swelling
at
the
end
of
the
spinal
cord
as
we
find
it
in
the
lowest
vertebrates
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
the
particular
motor
area
which
gives
the
faculty
of
articulate
speech
lies
in
a
small
patch
of
about
one
and
a
half
square
inches
on
the
left
side
of
the
lower
portion
of
the
first
brain
if
this
is
injured
the
disease
called
aphasia
is
produced
in
which
the
patient
loses
the
power
of
expressing
ideas
by
connected
words
the
corresponding
area
on
the
right
side
can
not
talk
but
in
persons
this
state
of
things
is
reversed
and
the
right
side
which
is
generally
aphasial
can
be
taught
to
speak
in
young
people
though
not
in
the
aged
higher
up
in
the
cortex
or
convoluted
envelope
of
the
brain
come
the
areas
for
hearing
and
seeing
the
latter
being
the
more
extensive
these
areas
are
filled
mainly
by
a
great
number
of
sensory
or
cells
connected
with
one
another
in
a
very
complicated
network
these
seem
to
be
connected
with
the
multitude
of
ideas
which
are
excited
in
the
brain
by
perceptions
derived
from
the
higher
senses
especially
that
of
sight
the
simple
movements
are
produced
by
a
few
large
which
have
only
one
idea
and
do
only
one
thing
whether
it
be
to
move
the
leg
or
the
arm
but
a
sensation
from
sight
often
calls
up
a
multitude
of
ideas
suppose
you
see
the
face
of
one
with
whom
some
fifty
years
ago
you
may
have
had
some
youthful
love
passages
but
your
lives
drifted
apart
and
you
now
meet
for
the
first
time
after
these
long
years
how
many
ideas
will
crowd
on
the
mind
how
many
will
be
set
vibrating
and
how
many
set
coursing
along
intricate
paths
no
wonder
that
the
are
numerous
and
minute
and
the
many
and
complicated
when
we
come
to
the
seats
of
the
intellectual
faculties
the
question
becomes
still
more
obscure
they
are
probably
situated
in
the
hinder
and
front
parts
of
the
surface
of
the
brain
and
depend
on
the
grey
matter
consisting
of
an
immense
number
of
minute
sensory
cells
it
has
been
computed
that
there
are
millions
in
the
area
of
a
square
inch
and
they
are
all
in
a
state
of
the
most
delicate
equilibrium
vibrating
with
the
slightest
breath
of
nervous
impression
they
depend
for
their
activity
entirely
on
the
sensory
perceptive
centres
for
there
is
no
consciousness
in
the
absence
of
sensory
stimulation
as
in
dreamless
sleep
perception
however
caused
whether
by
outward
stimulation
of
real
objects
or
by
former
perceptions
revived
by
memory
sends
a
stream
of
energy
through
the
which
expands
like
a
river
divided
into
numerous
channels
fertilising
the
intellectual
area
where
it
is
stored
up
by
memory
giving
us
the
idea
of
continual
individual
existence
and
by
some
mysterious
and
unknown
process
becoming
transformed
into
consciousness
and
deliberate
thought
and
conversely
the
process
is
reversed
when
what
we
call
will
is
excited
and
the
small
currents
of
the
intellectual
area
are
concentrated
by
an
effort
of
attention
and
sent
along
the
proper
to
the
whose
function
it
is
to
produce
the
desired
movement
this
mechanical
explanation
it
will
be
observed
leaves
entirely
untouched
the
question
of
the
real
essence
and
origin
of
these
intellectual
faculties
as
to
which
we
know
nothing
more
than
we
do
of
the
real
essence
and
origin
of
life
of
matter
and
of
energy
a
very
curious
light
however
is
thrown
on
them
by
phenomena
which
occur
in
abnormal
states
of
the
brain
as
in
trance
somnambulism
and
hypnotism
in
the
latter
by
straining
the
attention
on
a
given
object
or
idea
such
as
a
coin
held
in
the
hand
or
a
black
wafer
on
a
white
wall
the
normal
action
of
the
brain
is
in
the
case
of
many
one
out
of
every
three
or
out
of
gear
and
a
state
induced
in
which
the
will
seems
to
be
annihilated
and
the
thoughts
and
actions
brought
into
subjection
to
the
will
of
another
person
in
this
state
also
a
cataleptic
condition
of
the
muscles
is
often
induced
in
which
they
acquire
enormous
strength
and
rigidity
in
somnambulism
outward
consciousness
is
in
a
great
measure
suspended
and
the
somnambulist
lives
for
the
time
in
a
walking
dream
which
he
acts
and
mistakes
for
reality
in
this
state
old
perceptions
scarcely
felt
at
the
time
seem
to
revive
as
in
dreams
with
such
wonderful
vividness
and
accuracy
that
the
somnambulist
in
acting
the
dream
does
things
altogether
impossible
in
the
waking
state
thus
an
ignorant
scotch
is
said
to
have
recited
half
a
chapter
of
the
hebrew
version
of
the
old
testament
the
explanation
being
that
she
had
been
in
the
service
of
a
scotch
minister
who
was
studying
hebrew
and
who
used
to
walk
about
his
room
reciting
this
identical
passage
it
would
seem
as
if
the
brain
were
like
a
very
delicate
photograph
plate
which
takes
accurate
impressions
of
all
perceptions
whether
we
notice
them
or
not
and
stores
them
up
ready
to
be
reproduced
whenever
stronger
impressions
are
dormant
and
memory
by
some
strange
caprice
breathes
on
the
plate
most
wonderful
however
are
some
of
the
phenomena
of
trance
in
this
case
it
really
seems
as
if
two
distinct
individuals
might
inhabit
the
same
body
jones
falls
into
a
trance
and
dreams
that
he
is
smith
while
the
trance
lasts
he
acts
and
talks
as
smith
he
really
is
smith
and
even
addresses
his
former
self
jones
as
a
stranger
when
he
wakes
from
the
trance
he
has
no
recollection
of
it
and
takes
up
the
thread
of
his
own
life
just
as
if
he
had
dozed
for
a
minute
instead
of
being
in
a
trance
for
hours
but
if
he
falls
into
a
second
trance
days
or
weeks
afterwards
he
takes
up
his
trance
life
exactly
where
he
dropped
it
absolutely
forgetting
his
intermediate
real
life
and
so
he
may
go
on
alternating
between
two
lives
with
two
separate
personalities
and
consciousnesses
being
to
all
intents
and
purposes
now
jones
and
now
smith
if
he
died
during
a
trance
which
would
he
be
jones
or
smith
the
question
is
more
easily
asked
than
answered
but
it
certainly
appears
as
if
with
one
mode
of
motion
in
the
same
brain
you
might
have
one
mind
and
personal
identity
associated
with
it
and
with
another
mode
of
motion
different
ones
it
would
take
me
too
far
and
the
facts
are
too
doubtful
to
investigate
the
large
class
of
cases
included
under
the
terms
telepathy
psychism
and
spiritualism
it
may
suffice
to
say
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
evidence
for
the
reality
of
very
curious
phenomena
but
none
of
any
real
weight
for
their
being
caused
by
any
spiritualistic
or
supernatural
agency
they
all
seem
to
resolve
themselves
into
the
assertion
that
under
special
conditions
the
perceptions
of
one
brain
can
be
reproduced
in
another
otherwise
than
by
the
ordinary
medium
of
the
senses
and
that
in
such
conditions
a
special
sort
of
cataleptic
energy
or
psychic
force
may
be
developed
the
amount
of
negative
evidence
is
of
course
enormous
for
it
is
certain
that
in
millions
upon
millions
of
cases
thought
can
not
be
read
things
are
not
seen
beyond
the
range
of
vision
and
coincidences
do
not
occur
between
deaths
and
dreams
or
visions
neither
can
tables
be
turned
nor
heavy
bodies
lifted
without
some
known
form
of
energy
and
a
fulcrum
at
which
to
apply
it
this
borderland
of
knowledge
is
therefore
best
left
to
time
which
is
the
best
test
of
truth
that
which
is
real
will
survive
and
be
gradually
brought
within
the
domain
of
science
and
made
to
fit
in
with
other
facts
and
laws
of
nature
that
which
is
unreal
will
pass
away
as
ghosts
and
goblins
have
done
and
be
forgotten
as
the
fickle
fashion
changes
of
superstitious
fancy
in
the
meantime
we
shall
do
better
to
confine
ourselves
to
ascertained
facts
and
normal
conditions
it
is
pretty
certain
that
although
the
brain
greatly
preponderates
as
an
organ
of
mind
in
man
and
the
higher
animals
the
grey
tissue
in
the
spinal
marrow
and
nervous
ganglia
exercises
a
limited
amount
of
the
same
functions
proportionate
to
its
smaller
quantity
the
reflex
or
automatic
actions
such
as
breathing
are
carried
on
without
reference
to
the
brain
and
the
messages
are
received
and
transmitted
through
the
local
offices
without
going
to
the
head
office
this
is
the
case
with
many
complicated
motions
which
originated
in
the
brain
but
have
become
habitual
and
automatic
as
in
walking
where
thought
and
conscious
effort
only
intervene
when
something
unusual
occurs
which
requires
a
reference
to
the
head
office
and
in
the
still
more
complex
case
of
the
who
fingers
difficult
passages
correctly
while
thinking
of
something
else
or
even
talking
to
a
bystander
indeed
in
extreme
cases
where
experiments
on
the
brain
have
been
tried
on
lower
animals
it
is
found
that
it
can
be
entirely
removed
without
destroying
life
or
affecting
many
of
the
actions
which
require
perception
and
volition
thus
when
the
brain
has
been
entirely
removed
from
a
pigeon
it
smoothes
its
feathers
with
its
bill
when
they
have
been
ruffled
and
places
its
head
under
its
wing
when
it
sleeps
and
a
frog
under
the
same
conditions
if
held
by
one
foot
endeavours
to
draw
it
away
and
if
unsuccessful
places
the
other
foot
against
an
obstacle
in
order
to
get
more
purchase
in
the
effort
to
liberate
itself
so
much
for
the
organ
of
mind
the
other
factor
that
of
outward
stimulus
is
still
more
obvious
if
thought
can
not
exist
without
grey
neither
can
it
without
impressions
to
stimulate
that
tissue
a
perfect
brain
if
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
the
external
universe
could
no
more
think
and
have
perceptions
than
impressions
from
without
could
generate
them
without
the
appropriate
once
generated
the
mind
can
store
them
up
by
memory
control
them
by
reason
and
gradually
evolve
from
them
ever
higher
and
higher
ideas
and
trains
of
reasoning
both
in
the
individual
and
the
species
the
individual
passing
from
infancy
to
manhood
partly
by
heredity
from
ancestors
and
partly
by
the
word
in
the
large
sense
of
influences
of
all
sorts
from
the
surrounding
environment
in
the
species
by
a
similar
but
much
slower
development
from
savagery
to
civilisation
thus
the
whole
fabric
of
arithmetic
algebra
and
the
higher
calculi
are
built
up
from
the
primitive
perception
of
number
the
earliest
pal√¶olithic
savage
must
have
been
conscious
of
a
difference
between
encountering
one
or
two
or
mammoths
and
some
existing
races
of
savages
have
hardly
got
beyond
this
primitive
perception
some
australian
tribes
it
is
said
have
not
got
beyond
three
numerals
one
two
and
a
great
number
but
by
degrees
the
perceptions
of
number
have
become
more
extensive
and
accurate
and
the
number
of
fingers
on
each
hand
has
been
used
as
a
standard
of
comparison
thus
ten
or
the
number
of
fingers
on
the
two
hands
has
gradually
become
the
basis
of
arithmetical
numeration
and
from
this
up
to
sir
the
progression
is
regular
and
intelligible
but
newton
could
never
have
invented
the
differential
calculus
and
solved
the
problem
of
the
heavens
if
thousands
of
centuries
before
some
primitive
human
mind
had
not
received
the
perception
that
two
apples
or
two
bears
were
different
from
one
in
like
manner
geometry
as
its
name
indicates
arises
from
primitive
perceptions
of
space
applied
to
the
practical
necessity
of
in
alluvial
valleys
like
those
of
the
nile
and
euphrates
where
annual
inundations
obliterated
to
a
great
extent
the
dividing
lines
between
adjoining
properties
the
first
perceptions
of
space
would
take
the
form
of
the
rectangle
or
so
many
feet
or
paces
or
cubits
or
forwards
and
so
many
sideways
to
give
the
proper
area
but
as
areas
were
irregular
it
would
be
discovered
that
the
triangle
was
necessary
for
more
accurate
measurement
hence
the
science
of
the
triangle
circle
and
other
regular
forms
as
we
see
it
developed
in
euclid
and
later
treatises
on
geometry
until
we
see
it
in
its
latest
development
in
speculations
as
to
space
of
four
dimensions
but
in
all
these
cases
we
see
the
same
fundamental
principle
as
prevails
throughout
the
universe
under
the
name
of
the
of
always
something
out
of
something
never
something
out
of
nothing
this
therefore
defines
the
limit
of
human
knowledge
or
boundary
line
between
the
knowable
and
the
unknowable
whatever
is
according
to
existing
laws
is
whether
known
or
unknown
at
any
rate
is
is
unknowable
we
have
absolutely
no
faculties
to
enable
us
to
form
the
remotest
conception
of
what
the
essence
of
these
primary
atoms
and
energies
really
is
how
they
came
there
and
how
the
laws
or
invariable
sequences
under
which
they
act
came
to
be
impressed
on
them
we
have
no
faculties
because
we
have
never
had
any
perceptions
upon
which
the
mind
can
work
reason
and
imagination
can
no
more
work
without
antecedent
perceptions
than
a
bird
can
fly
in
a
vacuum
thus
for
instance
the
imagination
can
invent
dragons
centaurs
and
any
number
of
fabulous
monsters
by
piecing
together
fragments
of
perceptions
in
new
combinations
but
ask
it
to
invent
a
monster
whose
head
shall
be
that
of
an
inhabitant
of
saturn
and
its
body
that
of
a
denizen
of
jupiter
and
where
is
it
of
necessity
all
attempts
to
define
or
describe
things
of
which
we
have
never
had
perceptions
must
be
made
in
terms
of
things
of
which
we
have
had
perceptions
or
in
other
words
must
be
anthropomorphic
so
far
as
science
gives
any
positive
knowledge
as
to
the
relations
of
mind
to
matter
it
amounts
to
this
that
all
we
call
mind
is
indissolubly
connected
with
matter
through
the
grey
cells
of
the
brain
and
other
nervous
ganglia
this
is
positive
if
the
skull
could
be
removed
without
injury
to
the
living
organism
a
skilful
physiologist
could
play
with
his
finger
on
the
human
brain
as
on
that
of
a
dog
pigeon
or
other
animal
and
by
pressure
on
different
notes
as
on
the
keys
of
a
piano
annihilate
successively
voluntary
motion
speech
hearing
sight
and
finally
will
consciousness
reasoning
power
and
memory
but
beyond
this
physical
science
can
not
go
it
can
not
explain
how
molecular
motions
of
cells
of
can
be
transformed
into
or
can
create
the
phenomena
of
mind
any
more
than
it
can
explain
how
the
atoms
and
energies
to
which
it
has
traced
up
the
material
universe
were
themselves
created
or
what
they
really
are
all
attempts
to
further
fathom
the
depths
of
the
unknown
follow
a
different
line
that
of
metaphysics
or
in
other
words
introspection
of
mind
by
mind
and
endeavour
to
explain
thought
by
thinking
on
entering
into
this
region
we
at
once
find
that
the
solid
earth
is
giving
way
under
our
feet
and
that
we
are
attempting
to
fly
in
an
extremely
rare
atmosphere
if
indeed
we
are
not
idly
flapping
our
wings
in
an
absolute
vacuum
instead
of
ascertained
facts
which
all
recognise
and
experiments
which
conducted
under
the
same
conditions
always
give
the
same
results
we
have
a
dissolving
view
of
theories
and
intuitions
accepted
by
some
denied
by
others
and
changing
with
the
changing
conditions
of
the
age
and
with
individual
varieties
of
characters
emotions
and
wishes
thus
mind
and
soul
are
with
some
philosophers
identical
with
others
mind
is
a
product
of
soul
with
some
soul
is
a
subtle
essence
with
others
absolutely
immaterial
with
some
it
has
an
individual
with
others
a
universal
existence
by
some
it
is
limited
to
man
by
others
conceded
to
the
lower
animals
by
some
located
in
the
brain
by
others
in
the
heart
blood
pineal
gland
or
dura
mater
with
some
it
is
and
immortal
with
others
created
specially
for
its
own
individual
organism
and
so
on
the
greatest
philosophers
come
mostly
to
the
conclusion
that
we
really
know
nothing
about
it
thus
descartes
after
having
built
up
an
elaborate
metaphysical
theory
as
to
a
spiritual
indivisible
substance
independent
of
the
brain
and
cognisable
by
alone
ends
by
honestly
confessing
by
natural
reason
we
can
make
many
conjectures
about
the
soul
and
have
flattering
hopes
but
no
kant
also
greatest
of
metaphysicians
in
demolishing
the
fallacies
of
former
theories
when
he
comes
to
define
his
has
to
use
the
vaguest
of
phrases
such
as
indescribable
something
safely
located
out
of
space
and
time
as
such
not
subject
to
the
mutabilities
of
those
phenomenal
spheres
and
of
whose
ontological
existence
we
are
made
aware
by
its
phenomenal
projections
or
effects
in
the
sentence
takes
our
breath
away
and
makes
us
sympathise
with
bishop
berkeley
when
he
says
metaphysicians
have
first
raised
a
dust
and
then
complain
we
can
not
it
prepares
us
also
for
final
admission
that
nothing
can
really
be
proved
by
metaphysics
concerning
the
attributes
or
even
the
existence
of
the
soul
though
on
the
other
hand
as
it
can
not
be
disproved
its
reality
may
for
moral
purposes
be
assumed
it
appears
therefore
that
the
efforts
of
the
sublimest
transcendentalists
do
not
carry
us
one
step
farther
than
the
conclusions
of
the
commonest
viz
that
there
are
certain
fundamental
conditions
of
thought
such
as
space
time
consciousness
personal
identity
and
freedom
of
will
which
we
can
not
explain
but
can
not
get
rid
of
the
sublimest
speculations
of
a
plato
and
a
kant
bring
us
back
to
the
homely
conclusions
of
the
old
woman
in
the
nursery
ballad
in
whose
mind
grave
questions
as
to
her
personal
identity
were
raised
by
the
felonious
abstraction
of
the
lower
portion
of
her
petticoat
if
i
be
i
as
i
think
i
be
a
little
dog
at
home
and
know
me
it
is
a
safe
that
when
i
go
home
in
the
afternoon
my
wife
children
and
little
dog
will
recognise
me
as
being
myself
i
but
why
or
how
i
am
i
whether
i
was
i
before
i
was
born
or
shall
be
so
after
i
am
dead
i
really
know
no
more
than
the
little
dog
who
wags
his
tail
and
yelps
for
joy
when
he
recognises
my
personal
identity
as
something
distinct
from
his
own
when
he
sees
me
coming
up
the
walk
our
conceptions
therefore
are
necessarily
based
on
our
perceptions
and
are
what
is
called
anthropomorphic
the
term
has
almost
come
to
be
one
of
reproach
because
it
has
so
often
been
applied
to
religious
conceptions
of
a
deity
with
human
though
often
not
very
humane
attributes
but
if
considered
rightly
it
is
an
inevitable
necessity
of
any
attempt
to
define
such
a
being
or
beings
we
can
only
conceive
of
such
as
of
a
magnified
man
indefinitely
magnified
no
doubt
but
still
with
a
will
intelligence
and
faculties
corresponding
to
our
own
the
whole
supernatural
or
miraculous
theory
of
the
universe
rests
on
the
supposition
that
its
phenomena
are
in
a
great
many
cases
brought
about
not
by
uniform
law
but
by
the
intervention
of
some
power
which
by
the
exercise
of
will
guided
by
intelligent
design
alters
the
course
of
events
and
brings
about
special
effects
as
long
as
the
theory
is
confined
to
knowable
transformations
of
existing
things
like
those
which
are
seen
to
be
affected
by
human
will
it
is
not
necessarily
inconceivable
or
irrational
inferring
like
effects
from
like
causes
the
hypothesis
was
by
no
means
unreasonable
that
thunder
and
lightning
for
instance
were
caused
by
some
angry
invisible
power
in
the
clouds
on
the
contrary
the
first
savage
who
drew
the
deduction
was
a
natural
philosopher
who
reasoned
quite
justly
from
his
assumed
premises
whether
the
premises
were
true
or
not
was
a
question
which
could
only
be
determined
centuries
later
by
the
advance
of
accurate
knowledge
when
do
we
say
we
know
a
thing
not
when
we
know
its
essence
and
primary
origin
for
of
these
the
wisest
philosopher
is
as
ignorant
as
the
rudest
savage
but
when
we
know
its
place
in
the
universe
its
relation
to
other
things
and
can
fit
it
in
to
that
harmonious
sequence
of
events
which
is
summed
up
in
what
are
called
laws
of
nature
the
highest
knowledge
is
when
we
can
trace
it
up
to
its
earliest
origin
from
existing
matter
and
energy
and
follow
it
downwards
so
as
to
be
able
to
predict
its
results
the
force
of
gravity
affords
a
good
illustration
of
this
knowledge
both
where
it
comes
up
to
and
where
it
falls
short
of
perfection
law
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
as
regards
its
universal
application
and
power
of
prediction
but
we
do
not
yet
fully
understand
its
mode
of
action
or
its
relation
to
other
forms
of
energy
it
is
probable
that
some
day
we
may
be
able
to
understand
how
the
force
of
gravity
appears
to
act
instantaneously
at
a
distance
and
how
all
the
transformable
forces
gravity
light
heat
electricity
and
molecular
or
atomic
forces
are
but
different
manifestations
of
one
common
energy
but
in
the
meantime
we
know
this
for
certain
that
the
law
of
gravity
is
not
a
local
or
special
phenomenon
but
prevails
universally
from
the
fixed
stars
to
the
atoms
from
the
infinitely
great
to
the
infinitely
small
this
is
a
to
which
all
other
phenomena
which
are
true
facts
and
not
illusions
must
conform
in
like
manner
if
we
find
in
caves
or
under
circumstances
implying
enormous
antiquity
and
associated
with
remains
of
extinct
animals
rude
implements
so
exactly
resembling
those
in
use
among
existing
savages
that
if
the
collection
in
the
colonial
exhibition
of
stone
celts
and
used
by
the
bushmen
of
south
africa
were
placed
side
by
side
with
one
from
the
british
museum
of
similar
objects
from
cavern
or
the
caves
of
the
dordogne
no
one
but
an
expert
could
distinguish
between
them
the
conclusion
is
inevitable
that
devonshire
and
southern
france
were
inhabited
at
some
remote
period
by
a
race
of
men
not
more
advanced
than
the
bushmen
any
theory
of
origin
and
evolution
which
is
to
hold
water
must
take
account
of
this
fact
and
square
with
it
and
so
of
a
vast
variety
of
facts
which
have
been
reduced
to
law
and
become
certainly
known
during
the
last
a
great
deal
of
ground
remains
unexplored
or
only
partially
explored
but
sufficient
has
been
discovered
to
enable
us
to
say
that
what
we
know
we
know
thoroughly
and
that
certain
leading
facts
and
principles
undoubtedly
prevail
throughout
the
knowable
universe
including
not
only
that
which
is
known
but
that
which
is
as
yet
partially
or
wholly
unknown
for
instance
the
law
of
gravity
the
conservation
of
energy
the
indestructibility
of
matter
and
the
law
of

of

thus
i
may
hope
given
the
reader
some
precise
ideas
of
what
are
the
boundaries
and
conditions
of
human
knowledge
we
may
proceed
to
consider
their
application
to
the
highest
subjects
religions
and
philosophies
in
the
introductory
chapter
of
this
work
i
have
said
that
all
religions
are
in
effect
hypotheses
by
which
men
seek
to
reconcile
the
highest
aspirations
of
their
nature
with
the
facts
of
the
universe
and
bring
the
whole
into
some
harmonious
concordance
i
said
so
for
the
following
reasons
in
a
discussion
at
the
metaphysical
society
on
the
uniformity
of
laws
of
nature
recorded
in
the
century
huxley
is
represented
as
saying
that
he
considered
this
uniformity
not
as
an
axiomatic
truth
like
the
first
postulates
of
geometry
but
as
a
adding
however
that
it
was
an
hypothesis
which
had
never
been
known
to
fail
to
this
some
distinguished
advocates
of
catholic
theology
replied
that
their
conviction
was
of
a
higher
nature
for
their
belief
in
god
was
a
final
truth
which
was
the
basis
of
their
whole
intellectual
and
moral
nature
and
which
it
was
irrational
to
question
this
is
in
effect
cardinal
celebrated
argument
of
an
sense
based
on
a
complete
assent
of
all
the
faculties
and
which
was
therefore
a
higher
authority
than
any
conclusions
of
science
the
answer
is
obvious
that
complete
assent
so
far
from
being
a
test
of
truth
is
on
the
contrary
almost
always
a
proof
that
truth
has
not
been
attained
owing
either
to
erroneous
assumptions
as
to
the
premises
or
to
the
omission
of
important
factors
in
the
solution
of
the
problem
to
give
an
instance
i
suppose
there
could
not
be
a
stronger
case
of
complete
assent
than
that
of
the
inquisitors
who
condemned
the
theories
of
galileo
they
had
in
support
of
the
proposition
that
the
sun
revolved
round
the
earth
the
testimony
of
the
senses
the
universal
belief
of
mankind
in
all
ages
the
direct
statement
of
inspired
scripture
the
authority
of
the
infallible
church
was
all
this
to
be
set
aside
because
some
vainly
mad
with
dubious
told
them
on
grounds
of
some
science
that
the
earth
revolved
round
its
axis
and
round
the
sun
let
us
stamp
out
a
heresy
so
contrary
to
our
sense
and
so
fatal
to
all
the
most
certain
and
cherished
beliefs
of
the
christian
world
to
the
inspiration
of
the
word
of
god
and
to
the
authority
of
his
pur
si
muove
and
yet
the
earth
really
did
move
and
the
verdict
of
was
that
galileo
and
science
were
right
and
the
church
and
the
illative
sense
wrong
in
truth
the
distinction
between
the
conclusions
of
science
and
those
of
religious
creeds
might
be
more
properly
expressed
by
saying
that
the
former
are
which
never
fail
while
the
latter
are
which
frequently
fail
thus
the
fundamental
hypothesis
of
cardinal
newman
and
his
school
of
a
one
infinite
and
eternal
personal
deity
who
regulates
the
course
of
events
by
frequent
miraculous
interpositions
so
far
from
being
a
necessary
and
axiomatic
truth
has
never
appeared
so
to
the
immense
majority
of
the
human
race
and
even
at
the
present
day
in
civilised
and
christian
countries
its
principal
advocates
complain
that
out
of
every
hundred
practically
ignore
it
it
is
not
so
with
the
uniformity
of
the
laws
of
nature
no
pal√¶olithic
savage
ever
hesitated
about
putting
one
foot
after
another
in
chase
of
a
mammoth
from
a
fear
that
his
working
hypothesis
of
uniform
law
might
fail
the
support
of
the
solid
earth
give
way
and
with
his
next
step
he
might
find
himself
toppling
over
into
the
abyss
of
an
infinite
vacuum
in
like
manner
greeks
and
romans
indians
and
chinese
monotheists
polytheists
pantheists
jews
and
buddhists
christians
and
mahometans
all
use
standard
weights
in
their
daily
transactions
without
any
misgivings
that
the
law
of
gravity
may
turn
out
not
to
be
uniform
but
religions
theories
vary
from
time
to
time
and
from
place
to
place
and
we
can
in
a
great
many
cases
trace
their
origins
and
developments
like
those
of
other
political
and
social
organisms
to
trace
their
origins
we
must
as
in
the
case
of
social
institutions
look
first
at
the
ideas
prevailing
among
those
savage
and
barbarous
races
who
are
the
best
representatives
of
our
early
progenitors
and
secondly
at
historical
records
in
the
first
case
we
find
the
earliest
rudiments
of
religious
ideas
in
the
universal
belief
in
ghosts
and
spirits
every
man
is
conceived
of
as
being
a
double
of
himself
and
as
having
a
sort
of
shadowy
self
which
comes
and
goes
in
sleep
or
trance
and
finally
takes
leave
of
the
body
at
death
to
continue
its
existence
as
a
ghost
the
air
is
thus
peopled
with
an
immense
number
of
ghosts
who
continue
very
much
their
ordinary
existence
haunt
their
accustomed
abodes
and
retain
their
living
powers
and
attributes
which
are
exerted
generally
with
a
malevolent
desire
to
injure
and
annoy
hence
among
savage
races
and
by
survival
even
among
primitive
nations
of
the
present
day
we
find
the
most
curious
devices
to
cheat
or
frighten
away
the
ghost
so
that
he
may
not
return
to
the
house
in
which
he
died
thus
the
corpse
is
carried
out
not
by
the
door
but
by
a
hole
made
for
the
purpose
in
the
wall
which
is
afterwards
built
up
a
custom
which
prevails
with
a
number
of
widely
separated
hottentots
algonquins
and
fijians
and
the
practice
even
survives
among
more
civilised
nations
such
as
the
chinese
siamese
and
thibetans
nor
is
it
wholly
extinct
in
some
of
the
primitive
parts
of
europe
this
idea
obviously
led
to
the
practice
of
constructing
tents
or
houses
for
the
ghosts
to
live
in
and
of
depositing
with
them
articles
of
food
and
weapons
to
be
used
in
their
ghostly
existence
in
the
case
of
great
chiefs
not
only
their
arms
and
ornaments
are
deposited
but
their
horses
slaves
and
wives
were
sacrificed
and
buried
with
them
so
that
they
might
enter
with
an
appropriate
retinue
the
early
egyptian
tombs
were
as
nearly
as
possible
facsimiles
of
the
house
in
which
the
deceased
had
lived
with
pictures
of
his
geese
oxen
and
other
possessions
painted
on
the
walls
evidently
under
the
idea
that
the
ghosts
of
these
objects
would
minister
to
the
wants
and
please
the
fancy
of
the
human
ghost
whose
eternal
dwelling
was
in
the
tomb
where
his
mummy
was
deposited
another
development
of
the
belief
in
spirits
is
that
of
in
which
superstitious
reverence
is
paid
to
some
stock
or
stone
tree
or
animal
in
which
a
mysterious
influence
is
supposed
to
reside
probably
owing
to
its
being
the
chosen
abode
of
some
powerful
spirit
this
is
common
among
the
negro
races
and
it
takes
a
curious
development
among
many
races
of
american
indians
where
the
tribe
is
distinguished
by
the
totem
or
badge
of
some
particular
animal
such
as
the
bear
the
tortoise
or
the
hare
which
is
in
some
way
supposed
to
be
the
patron
spirit
of
the
clan
and
often
the
progenitor
from
whom
they
are
descended
this
idea
is
so
rooted
that
intermarriage
between
men
and
women
who
have
the
same
totem
is
prohibited
as
a
sort
of
incest
and
the
daughter
of
a
must
seek
for
a
husband
among
the
sons
of
the
deer
or
fox
possibly
a
vestige
of
the
survival
of
this
idea
may
be
traced
in
the
of
the
sutherland
family
and
the
wild
cat
may
have
been
the
totem
of
the
clan
chattan
while
the
oak
tree
was
that
of
the
clan
quoich
with
whom
they
fought
on
the
inch
of
perth
be
this
as
it
may
it
is
clearly
a
most
ancient
and
widespread
idea
and
prevails
from
greenland
to
australia
while
it
evidently
formed
the
oldest
element
of
the
prehistoric
religion
of
egypt
where
each
separate
province
had
its
peculiar
sacred
animal
worshipped
by
the
populace
in
one
nome
and
detested
in
the
neighbouring
one
by
far
the
earliest
traces
of
anything
resembling
religious
ideas
are
those
found
in
of
the
neolithic
period
it
is
evident
that
at
this
remote
period
ideas
prevailed
respecting
ghost
or
spirit
life
and
a
future
existence
very
similar
to
those
of
modern
savages
they
placed
weapons
and
implements
in
the
graves
of
the
dead
and
not
infrequently
sacrificed
human
victims
and
held
cannibal
feasts
whether
this
was
done
in
the
far
more
remote
pal√¶olithic
era
is
uncertain
for
very
few
undoubted
burials
of
this
period
have
been
discovered
and
those
few
have
frequently
been
used
again
for
later
interments
we
can
only
draw
a
negative
inference
from
the
absence
of
idols
which
are
so
abundant
in
the
prehistoric
abodes
explored
by
professor
schliemann
among
the
very
numerous
carvings
and
drawings
found
in
the
caves
of
the
reindeer
period
in
france
and
germany
that
the
religion
of
the
pal√¶olithic
men
if
they
had
any
had
not
reached
the
stage
when
spirits
or
deities
were
represented
by
images
for
the
first
traces
therefore
of
anything
like
what
is
now
understood
by
the
term
religion
we
must
look
beyond
the
vague
superstitions
of
savages
at
the
historical
records
of
civilised
nations
as
civilisation
advanced
population
multiplied
and
rude
tribes
of
hunters
were
amalgamated
into
agricultural
communities
and
powerful
empires
in
which
a
leisured
and
cultured
class
arose
to
whom
the
old
superstitions
were
no
longer
sufficient
they
had
to
enlarge
their
from
the
worship
of
stocks
and
stones
and
fear
of
ghosts
to
take
in
a
multitude
of
new
facts
and
ideas
and
specially
those
relating
to
natural
phenomena
which
had
roused
their
curiosity
or
become
important
to
them
as
matters
of
practical
utility
the
establishment
of
an
hereditary
caste
of
priests
accelerated
this
evolution
of
religious
ideas
and
from
time
to
time
recorded
its
progress
the
oldest
of
such
records
are
those
of
egypt
and
chald√¶a
where
the
fertility
of
alluvial
valleys
watered
by
great
rivers
had
led
to
the
earliest
development
of
a
high
civilisation
the
records
also
of
the
chinese
hindoos
persians
and
other
nations
take
us
a
long
way
back
towards
the
origins
of
religions
in
all
cases
we
find
them
identical
with
the
first
origins
of
science
and
taking
the
form
of
attempted
explanations
of
natural
phenomena
by
the
theory
of
deified
objects
and
powers
of
nature
in
the
vedas
we
see
this
in
the
simplest
form
where
the
gods
are
simply
personifications
of
the
heavens
earth
sun
moon
dawn
and
so
forth
and
where
we
should
say
the
red
glow
of
morning
announces
the
rising
of
the
sun
they
express
it
that
aurora
blushes
at
the
approach
of
her
lover
the
mighty
it
is
very
interesting
to
observe
how
the
old
chald√¶an
legend
of
the
creation
of
the
world
has
been
modified
in
the
far
later
jewish
edition
of
it
in
genesis
to
adapt
it
to
monotheistic
ideas
the
chald√¶an
legend
begins
like
that
of
genesis
with
an
without
form
and
void
and
darkness
on
the
chaotic
deep
in
each
legend
the
spirit
of
god
called
absu
in
the
chald√¶an
moves
on
the
face
of
the
waters
and
they
are
gathered
together
and
separated
from
the
land
but
here
a
difference
begins
in
the
original
chald√¶an
legend
great
gods
were
then
made
the
gods
lakman
and
lakmana
caused
themselves
to
come
forth
the
gods
assur
and
kesar
were
made
the
gods
anu
bel
and
hea
were
the
appearance
of
the
gods
lakman
and
lakmana
was
the
primitive
mode
of
expressing
the
same
idea
as
that
which
is
expressed
in
genesis
by
saying
that
god
created
the
firmament
separating
the
heaven
above
from
the
earth
beneath
assur
and
kesar
mean
the
same
thing
as
the
hosts
of
heaven
and
the
earth
the
god
bel
is
the
sun
and
so
forth
it
is
evident
that
the
first
attempts
to
explain
the
phenomena
of
nature
originated
in
the
idea
that
motion
and
power
implied
life
personality
and
conscious
will
and
therefore
that
the
earth
sky
sun
moon
and
other
grand
and
striking
phenomena
must
be
regarded
as
separate
gods
as
culture
advanced
astronomy
became
more
and
more
prominent
in
these
early
religions
and
solar
myths
became
a
principal
part
of
their
mythologies
while
astrology
or
the
influence
of
planets
and
stars
on
human
affairs
became
an
important
part
of
practical
life
the
chald√¶an
legend
referred
to
contains
a
mass
of
astronomical
knowledge
which
in
the
genesis
edition
is
reduced
to
made
the
stars
it
describes
how
the
constellations
were
assigned
their
forms
and
names
the
twelve
signs
of
the
zodiac
established
the
year
divided
into
twelve
months
the
equinoxes
determined
and
the
seasons
set
their
bounds
also
how
the
moon
was
made
to
regulate
the
months
by
its
disc
shining
forth
to
lighten
the
heavens
which
on
the
seventh
day
approaches
a
in
the
still
older
egyptian
pyramids
we
find
proof
of
the
long
previous
existence
of
great
astronomical
knowledge
and
refined
methods
of
observation
for
these
buildings
which
are
at
once
the
largest
and
the
oldest
in
the
world
are
laid
down
so
exactly
in
a
meridian
line
and
with
such
a
close
approximation
to
the
true
latitude
as
would
have
otherwise
been
impossible
in
fact
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
while
they
were
constructed
as
tombs
for
kings
they
were
at
the
same
time
intended
for
national
observatories
for
the
arrangement
of
the
internal
passages
as
such
is
to
make
the
great
pyramid
serve
the
purpose
of
a
telescope
equatorially
mounted
and
showing
the
transits
of
stars
and
planets
over
the
meridian
by
reference
to
a
reflected
image
of
what
was
then
the
polar
star
a
knowledge
of
which
was
essential
for
accurate
calculation
of
the
calendar
and
seasons
for
fixing
the
proper
date
of
religious
ceremonies
and
very
probably
for
astrological
purposes
the
prevalence
of
these
solar
and
astronomical
myths
among
a
number
of
different
nations
separated
by
wide
intervals
of
space
and
time
is
very
remarkable
egyptians
indians
babylonians
chinese
mexicans
and
peruvians
had
myths
which
were
strangely
similar
indeed
almost
identical
based
on
the
annual
passage
through
the
constellations
of
the
zodiac
his
apparent
decline
and
death
as
he
approached
the
winter
solstice
and
his
return
to
life
when
he
had
passed
it
gave
rise
to
myths
of
the
murder
of
the
by
some
fierce
wild
boar
or
treacherous
enemy
and
of
his
triumphant
resurrection
in
renewed
glory
hence
also
the
passage
of
the
winter
solstice
was
a
season
of
general
rejoicing
and
festivity
traces
of
which
survive
when
the
sirloin
and
turkey
smoke
upon
the
hospitable
tables
of
modern
christmas
one
remarkable
myth
had
a
very
universal
acceptance
that
of
the
birth
of
the
infant
from
a
virgin
mother
it
appears
to
have
originated
from
the
period
some
years
ago
when
the
sun
which
now
rises
at
the
winter
solstice
in
the
constellation
of
sagittarius
rose
in
that
of
pisces
with
the
constellation
of
the
virgin
with
upraised
arms
marked
by
five
stars
setting
in
the
anyhow
this
myth
of
an
infant
god
born
of
a
virgin
mother
holds
a
prominent
place
in
the
religions
of
egypt
india
china
chald√¶a
greece
rome
siam
mexico
peru
and
other
nations
the
resemblances
are
often
so
close
that
the
first
jesuit
missionaries
to
china
found
that
their
account
of
the
miraculous
conception
of
christ
had
been
anticipated
by
that
of
born
and
if
an
ancient
priest
of
thebes
or
heliopolis
could
be
restored
to
life
and
taken
to
the
gallery
of
dresden
he
would
see
in
madonna
di
san
sisto
what
he
would
consider
to
be
an
admirable
representation
of
horus
in
the
arms
of
isis
the
planets
also
still
more
mysterious
in
their
movements
than
the
sun
and
therefore
still
more
endowed
with
faculties
of
life
power
and
purpose
were
from
an
early
period
believed
to
exercise
an
influence
on
human
affairs
of
the
universality
of
this
belief
we
find
traces
in
the
names
of
the
days
of
the
week
which
are
so
generally
taken
from
the
sun
moon
and
five
visible
mars
jupiter
venus
and
whom
special
days
were
dedicated
if
every
seventh
day
is
a
day
of
rest
it
was
originally
so
because
it
was
thought
unlucky
to
undertake
any
work
on
the
sabbath
saturday
or
day
of
the
gloomy
and
malignant
saturn
as
time
rolled
on
and
civilisation
advanced
this
simple
and
deification
of
astronomical
phenomena
developed
into
larger
and
more
complex
conceptions
following
different
lines
of
evolution
polytheism
pantheism
and
monotheism
began
to
emerge
as
religious
systems
with
definite
creeds
rituals
and
sacred
books
these
lines
seem
to
have
been
determined
a
good
deal
by
the
genius
of
the
race
in
which
the
religious
development
took
place
the
impressions
made
on
the
human
mind
by
the
surrounding
universe
are
very
various
suppose
ourselves
looking
up
at
the
heavens
on
a
clear
starry
night
what
will
be
the
impression
to
one
that
of
awe
and
reverence
and
he
will
feel
crushed
as
it
were
into
nothingness
in
the
presence
of
such
a
sublime
manifestation
of
majesty
and
glory
another
of
more
√¶sthetic
nature
will
be
charmed
by
the
beauty
of
the
spectacle
and
tempted
to
assign
life
to
it
and
to
personify
and
dramatise
its
incidents
a
third
of
a
scientific
turn
will
above
all
things
wish
to
understand
it
thus
we
find
the
impression
of
awe
preponderating
among
the
semitic
races
generally
and
as
in
their
political
relations
so
in
their
religious
conceptions
we
find
them
prone
to
prostrate
themselves
before
despotic
power
with
the
greeks
again
the
√¶sthetic
idea
almost
swallowed
up
the
others
and
the
old
astronomical
myths
blossomed
into
a
perfect
of
poetical
and
fanciful
legends
the
chinese
never
got
beyond
a
simple
pantheism
which
looked
upon
the
universe
as
being
alive
and
saw
nothing
behind
it
while
the
more
metaphysical
and
physically
feebler
races
of
hindoos
and
buddhists
refined
their
pantheism
into
a
system
of
illusion
in
which
their
own
existence
and
the
surrounding
universe
were
literally
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
and
to
be
with
a
was
the
final
consummation
devoutly
to
be
desired
monotheism
developed
itself
later
partly
from
the
feeling
of
the
unity
of
nature
forcing
itself
on
the
more
philosophical
minds
partly
from
that
feeling
of
reverence
and
awe
in
presence
of
the
unknown
which
swallowed
up
other
conceptions
and
partly
in
the
earlier
stages
from
the
feeling
which
exalted
the
local
god
of
the
tribe
or
nation
first
into
a
supremacy
over
other
gods
and
finally
into
sole
supremacy
degrading
all
other
gods
into
the
category
of
dumb
idols
made
by
human
hands
in
the
old
testament
we
can
trace
the
development
of
this
latter
idea
in
its
successive
stages
until
the
later
days
of
the
jewish
monarchy
it
is
evident
that
the
jews
never
doubted
the
existence
of
other
gods
and
their
allegiance
oscillated
between
jehovah
and
the
heathen
deities
symbolised
by
the
golden
calf
worshipped
in
high
places
and
contending
for
the
mastership
in
the
rival
sacrifices
of
elijah
and
the
priests
of
baal
but
the
prophetic
element
gradually
introduced
higher
ideas
and
in
the
reigns
of
hezekiah
and
josiah
the
worship
of
jehovah
as
the
sole
god
became
the
religion
of
the
state
and
old
legends
and
documents
were
in
this
sense
in
the
sacred
book
which
was
discovered
and
published
for
the
first
time
in
the
reign
of
the
latter
king
the
subsequent
misfortunes
of
the
nation
their
captivity
and
contact
with
other
religions
in
babylonia
strengthened
this
monotheism
into
an
ardent
passionate
national
faith
as
it
has
continued
to
be
with
this
remarkable
people
up
to
the
present
day
christianity
and
mahometanism
children
of
judaism
have
spread
this
form
of
faith
over
a
great
part
of
the
civilised
world
and
of
the
three
theories
of
polytheism
pantheism
and
monotheism
it
may
be
said
that
only
the
two
latter
survive
polytheism
was
bound
to
perish
first
for
slow
as
the
advance
of
science
was
the
uniformity
of
most
of
the
phenomena
which
had
been
attributed
to
so
many
separate
gods
could
not
fail
to
make
an
impression
and
as
ideas
of
morality
came
slowly
and
tardily
to
be
evolved
as
an
element
of
religion
the
cruel
rites
and
scandalous
fables
which
so
generally
accompanied
polytheistic
religions
became
shocking
to
an
awakening
conscience
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
this
element
of
morality
which
has
now
gone
so
far
towards
swallowing
up
the
others
was
the
latest
to
appear
even
in
the
jewish
conception
jehovah
was
for
a
long
time
just
as
often
cruel
jealous
and
capricious
as
just
and
merciful
and
doctrine
that
because
god
had
the
power
to
do
as
he
liked
he
was
warranted
in
creating
a
large
portion
of
the
human
race
as
of
wrath
predestined
to
eternal
punishment
is
as
revolting
to
the
modern
conscience
as
any
sacrifice
to
beelzebub
or
moloch
if
we
wish
to
see
how
little
necessary
connection
there
is
between
morality
and
monotheism
we
have
only
to
look
at
mahometanism
which
in
its
extremer
forms
may
be
called
monotheism
run
mad
the
wahabite
reformer
we
are
told
by
palgrave
preached
that
there
were
only
two
deadly
sins
paying
divine
honours
to
any
creature
of
and
smoking
tobacco
and
that
murder
adultery
and
such
like
trivial
matters
were
minor
offences
which
a
merciful
allah
would
condone
he
held
also
that
of
the
whole
inhabitants
of
the
world
all
would
surely
be
damned
except
one
out
of
the
sects
of
mahometans
who
held
the
true
faith
and
dwelt
in
the
district
of
riad
this
illustrates
the
insane
extremes
into
which
all
human
speculations
run
if
a
single
this
case
that
of
awe
reverence
and
abject
submission
in
presence
of
an
almighty
allowed
to
run
its
course
without
check
and
obtain
undue
preponderance
apart
from
these
extreme
instances
we
may
say
that
the
two
religious
theories
which
have
survived
to
the
present
day
in
the
struggle
for
existence
are
monotheism
and
pantheism
pantheism
is
in
the
main
the
creed
of
half
the
human
the
teeming
millions
of
india
china
japan
ceylon
thibet
siam
and
burmah
how
deeply
it
is
rooted
in
their
conceptions
was
very
forcibly
impressed
on
me
in
a
conversation
i
had
on
board
one
of
the
and
steamers
with
an
english
missionary
returning
from
china
he
told
me
how
he
had
dined
one
evening
with
an
intelligent
chinese
merchant
and
after
dinner
they
walked
in
the
garden
discussing
religious
subjects
and
he
tried
to
impress
on
his
host
the
first
principles
of
the
christian
religion
it
was
a
starlight
night
and
for
sole
reply
the
chinese
gentleman
stretched
his
hand
to
the
heavens
and
said
you
mean
to
tell
me
all
that
is
you
take
me
for
a
fool
the
chinese
was
as
absolute
in
its
conclusions
for
pantheism
as
that
of
cardinal
newman
for
theism
in
fact
pantheism
though
not
the
whole
truth
and
almost
as
inconsistent
as
polytheism
with
the
real
facts
of
the
universe
as
disclosed
by
science
has
a
certain
poetical
truth
in
it
to
which
chords
of
human
emotion
vibrate
responsively
and
is
perhaps
not
so
widely
in
error
as
some
of
the
extreme
theories
which
treat
matter
as
something
base
and
brutal
noble
a
sense
sublime
of
something
far
more
deeply
interfused
whose
dwelling
is
the
light
of
setting
suns
and
the
round
ocean
and
the
living
air
and
the
blue
sky
and
in
the
mind
of
man
a
motion
and
a
spirit
that
impels
all
thinking
things
all
objects
of
all
thoughts
and
rolls
through
all
are
pure
pantheism
and
yet
we
can
not
but
feel
ourselves
to
a
great
extent
in
sympathy
with
them
so
also
the
lines
of
a
greater
than
wordsworth
shakespeare
are
pure
buddhism
the
towers
the
gorgeous
palaces
the
solemn
temples
the
great
globe
itself
yea
all
which
it
inherit
shall
dissolve
and
like
this
insubstantial
pageant
faded
leave
not
a
rack
behind
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
and
our
little
life
is
rounded
with
a
sleep
no
one
can
read
these
lines
without
feeling
that
the
buddhist
conception
is
as
far
as
possible
from
being
a
trivial
or
vulgar
one
and
that
the
triviality
and
vulgarity
are
rather
with
those
who
can
not
up
to
a
certain
point
understand
and
sympathise
with
it
the
religions
of
the
east
are
very
philosophical
and
have
kept
very
clearly
in
view
this
fundamental
distinction
between
the
knowable
and
the
unknowable
in
the
of
july
there
is
an
interesting
account
of
a
conversation
between
an
american
missionary
and
the
bozu
or
chief
priest
of
the
great
temple
of
the
shin
sect
of
buddhists
at
kioto
in
japan
the
priest
was
an
intelligent
and
highly
educated
gentleman
who
spoke
english
and
was
well
versed
in
the
speculations
of
modern
philosophy
the
conversation
turned
on
theological
questions
and
when
pressed
by
the
argument
for
a
divine
creator
from
design
shown
in
the
universe
implying
intelligence
he
replied
god
can
not
matter
only
artificial
things
show
design
only
things
which
can
be
made
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
a
thing
shows
design
you
only
mean
that
by
trying
a
man
could
make
and
he
proceeded
to
illustrate
it
thus
show
me
a
gold
ring
the
ring
shows
design
but
not
the
gold
gold
is
an
ultimate
element
which
can
neither
be
made
nor
destroyed
when
men
can
make
a
world
then
they
can
prove
that
this
one
shows
design
for
the
only
way
they
know
of
design
is
by
what
they
he
went
on
to
argue
for
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
as
a
consequence
for
its
and
the
transmigration
of
souls
from
the
conservation
of
energy
and
concluded
his
argument
against
the
creation
and
government
of
the
world
by
a
comprehensible
anthropomorphic
creator
by
adducing
the
existence
of
evil
is
a
sickness
he
said
fever
and
ague
what
do
you
call
the
medicine
to
cure
that
now
we
have
not
found
that
long
a
good
god
would
not
have
let
so
many
people
suffer
if
he
could
have
given
them
that
a
man
found
it
by
chance
the
sickness
and
suffering
in
this
life
are
for
wrong
done
in
another
we
may
not
accept
this
unproved
theory
of
the
cause
of
sickness
and
suffering
but
it
is
very
interesting
to
find
that
candid
and
intelligent
minds
brought
up
in
a
society
and
religious
beliefs
so
widely
different
from
our
own
have
arrived
practically
at
the
same
conclusions
as
john
stuart
mill
herbert
spencer
and
other
leaders
of
advanced
thought
in
modern
europe
and
drawn
almost
identically
the
same
line
between
that
which
is
knowable
and
that
which
is
unknowable
by
the
human
mind
but
however
we
may
become
in
seeing
the
good
in
other
forms
of
creed
we
english
of
the
nineteenth
century
are
not
going
to
turn
either
pantheists
or
buddhists
and
practically
the
contest
of
the
present
day
is
between
the
supernatural
or
miraculous
and
the
natural
or
scientific
hypotheses
according
to
the
former
the
operations
of
the
universe
are
carried
on
to
a
considerable
extent
by
what
may
be
called
secondary
interferences
of
a
supernatural
being
who
with
will
intelligence
and
design
like
human
though
vastly
superior
frequently
interposes
to
alter
the
course
of
events
and
bring
about
something
which
natural
law
would
not
have
brought
about
the
other
hypothesis
can
not
be
stated
better
than
in
bishop
words
that
the
great
first
cause
created
things
so
perfect
from
the
first
that
no
such
secondary
interferences
have
ever
been
necessary
and
everything
has
been
and
is
evolved
from
the
primary
atoms
and
energies
in
a
necessary
and
invariable
succession
the
supernatural
and
the
natural
theories
of
the
universe
are
thus
brought
into
direct
antagonism
for
the
supernatural
theory
it
must
be
conceded
that
it
is
quite
conceivable
as
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
it
has
been
the
almost
universal
conception
of
mankind
for
ages
and
remains
so
still
for
the
greater
number
it
is
as
i
have
said
the
inevitable
first
conception
when
men
began
to
reflect
on
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
and
to
reason
from
effects
to
causes
i
have
always
thought
that
hume
went
too
far
in
condemning
miracles
as
absolutely
incredible
it
is
a
question
of
evidence
i
can
conceive
that
the
true
explanation
of
the
universe
might
have
been
natural
law
as
the
general
rule
supplemented
by
miracles
just
as
readily
as
that
it
is
law
always
and
miracle
never
the
verdict
must
be
decided
by
the
weight
of
evidence
the
two
theories
must
be
called
face
to
face
before
the
tribunal
of
and
its
decision
must
be
respected
this
is
exactly
what
has
been
going
on
for
the
last
two
centuries
and
specially
for
the
last
half
century
and
the
record
of
decisions
is
now
a
very
ample
one
in
every
single
instance
law
has
carried
the
day
against
miracle
instance
after
instance
has
occurred
in
which
phenomena
which
in
former
ages
were
attributed
without
hesitation
to
supernatural
agencies
have
been
conclusively
proved
to
be
due
to
natural
laws
take
the
obvious
instance
of
thunder
when
horace
wrote
jam
satis
terris
nivis
atque
dir√¶
grandinis
misit
pater
et
rubente
dextera
sacras
jaculatus
arces
terruit
urbem
he
wrote
to
a
public
to
whom
it
was
an
undoubted
article
of
faith
that
thunder
and
lightning
hail
and
snowstorms
came
direct
from
the
father
of
the
gods
in
the
sky
even
to
a
late
period
this
was
the
general
faith
and
the
prayers
in
our
rubric
for
rain
or
fine
weather
remain
as
a
survival
of
the
belief
that
these
things
when
unusual
or
in
excess
are
supernatural
manifestations
but
benjamin
franklin
said
there
is
nothing
supernatural
about
lightning
i
will
bring
it
down
from
the
clouds
and
manufacture
it
by
turning
a
appeal
being
made
to
the
verdict
is
that
franklin
was
right
and
that
protect
ships
and
houses
better
than
prayers
or
incantations
again
when
galileo
and
the
church
joined
issue
as
to
whether
the
earth
was
round
or
flat
inspiration
and
authority
were
cited
in
vain
for
the
received
theory
said
it
was
round
and
it
was
proved
to
be
so
by
men
sailing
round
it
the
law
of
gravity
was
considered
a
very
dangerous
heresy
and
for
a
long
time
pious
divines
held
out
against
its
conclusions
and
contended
that
it
was
no
better
than
atheism
to
doubt
that
comets
were
signs
of
anger
sent
to
warn
a
sinful
world
but
halley
calculated
the
time
of
his
return
according
to
the
laws
of
gravity
and
appeal
being
made
to
fact
the
comet
returned
true
to
time
this
has
occurred
so
often
that
few
are
left
who
doubt
the
universal
prevalence
of
law
in
the
material
universe
where
former
generations
saw
miracles
at
every
turn
nor
is
the
defeat
of
miracle
less
conspicuous
in
the
spiritual
world
where
former
ages
and
rude
races
saw
and
still
see
possession
by
evil
spirits
modern
doctors
see
fevers
epilepsies
or
insanity
once
more
appeal
being
made
to
the
old
administered
incantations
the
new
ones
cure
the
most
patients
in
like
manner
demonology
and
witchcraft
with
all
their
train
of
cruelties
and
horrors
once
universally
believed
even
by
men
like
justice
hale
have
passed
into
oblivion
as
completely
as
the
lami√¶
phorkyads
and
other
fantastic
figures
of
the
classical
walpurgisnight
is
the
world
the
better
or
the
worse
for
this
triumph
of
natural
law
over
supernaturalism
the
triumph
has
been
so
complete
in
innumerable
instances
without
a
single
one
to
the
contrary
that
belief
in
the
permanence
and
universality
of
natural
law
has
become
almost
an
instinct
in
all
educated
minds
and
even
those
who
cling
to
old
beliefs
must
admit
that
the
most
cogent
and
irresistible
evidence
is
requisite
to
establish
the
fact
of
a
real
supernatural
interference
it
may
be
taken
as
an
axiom
that
wherever
a
natural
explanation
is
possible
a
miraculous
one
is
impossible
now
this
is
just
the
point
on
which
as
knowledge
has
increased
the
evidence
for
miracles
has
become
weaker
almost
in
the
exact
ratio
in
which
the
necessity
for
evidence
has
become
stronger
take
for
instance
the
following
case
recorded
by
braid
of
glasgow
miss
had
suffered
from
ophthalmia
and
was
totally
blind
she
could
not
discern
a
single
letter
of
the
of
a
book
placed
close
to
her
though
some
of
the
letters
were
a
quarter
of
an
inch
long
braid
placed
the
patient
in
a
condition
of
hypnotism
or
artificial
somnambulism
and
directed
the
nervous
force
or
sustained
attention
of
the
mind
to
the
eyes
by
wafting
over
them
after
a
first
sitting
of
about
ten
minutes
she
was
able
to
read
a
great
part
of
the
and
after
four
more
sittings
she
was
able
to
read
the
print
in
a
newspaper
and
was
quite
cured
for
the
rest
of
her
life
in
another
case
that
of
blindness
of
the
left
eye
had
occurred
owing
to
an
attack
of
rheumatic
fever
the
structure
of
the
eye
both
external
and
internal
being
considerably
injured
and
more
than
half
the
cornea
covered
by
an
opaque
film
after
a
few
sittings
the
cornea
became
transparent
and
the
patient
was
cured
in
both
these
cases
the
blind
were
made
to
see
by
processes
which
were
purely
mechanical
for
hypnotism
was
induced
by
the
simple
means
of
making
the
patient
strain
her
attention
on
some
fixed
idea
or
object
commonly
on
a
black
wafer
stuck
on
a
white
wall
and
the
stimulation
of
the
optic
nerve
to
greater
activity
did
the
rest
and
if
the
blind
could
be
made
to
see
the
deaf
were
made
to
hear
and
the
lame
and
halt
to
walk
by
the
same
mechanical
process
here
there
is
an
explanation
of
of
all
recorded
miracles
by
purely
natural
causes
again
take
the
case
of
the
berlin
bookseller
nicolai
who
having
fallen
into
for
a
whole
year
saw
when
awake
visions
so
real
and
palpable
that
he
may
be
said
to
have
lived
in
the
company
of
disembodied
spirits
undistinguishable
from
actual
men
and
women
this
is
a
common
phenomenon
in
vivid
dreams
but
the
berlin
case
takes
us
a
step
farther
and
shows
us
how
subjective
impressions
may
assume
the
form
of
objective
realities
even
in
the
case
of
a
man
wide
awake
of
a
sceptical
turn
of
mind
and
in
full
possession
of
his
reasoning
faculties
why
then
should
we
be
driven
to
the
alternative
of
miracle
or
imposture
to
account
for
similar
dreams
or
visions
being
taken
for
objective
realities
by
enthusiastic
minds
living
in
an
atmosphere
of
religious
excitement
in
an
uncritical
age
when
supernatural
occurrences
were
considered
to
be
matters
of
course
and
history
is
full
of
instances
which
show
how
any
supernatural
germ
planted
in
such
a
medium
propagates
itself
and
extends
to
millions
almost
as
rapidly
as
the
bacillus
germ
does
in
an
epidemic
of
dance
or
the
dancing
mania
ran
the
round
of
europe
like
the
potato
disease
and
even
yet
survives
in
the
hysterical
affections
of
the
sect
of
shakers
the
gift
of
tongues
spread
like
wildfire
through
congregation
and
only
died
out
because
it
had
fallen
on
the
uncongenial
soil
of
the
nineteenth
century
even
the
story
of
the
tail
of
the
lion
over
the
gateway
of
the
old
northumberland
house
being
seen
by
many
to
wag
because
one
had
asserted
it
illustrates
the
contagiousness
of
nervous
sympathy
and
the
tricks
which
can
play
with
the
senses
another
great
blow
has
been
dealt
against
the
miraculous
theory
by
what
can
only
be
called
the
singular
want
of
intelligence
displayed
in
the
exercise
of
miraculous
power
as
commonly
recorded
the
or
effect
desired
to
be
produced
by
miracles
is
to
convert
mankind
from
sin
or
to
attest
a
divine
mission
by
convincing
proofs
even
ordinary
human
how
much
more
so
that
of
a
superior
see
that
to
attain
this
end
the
means
must
be
to
make
the
proof
convincing
there
is
no
reason
in
itself
why
it
should
not
be
so
the
fact
that
a
man
who
was
alive
and
signed
a
will
is
now
dead
is
attested
as
regards
the
latter
proposition
by
a
proper
medical
certificate
and
as
regards
the
former
by
two
credible
witnesses
who
are
prepared
to
come
into
court
give
their
names
and
addresses
depose
on
oath
to
the
signature
and
stand
if
this
testimony
is
required
to
establish
a
fact
so
antecedently
probable
as
that
one
particular
man
has
undergone
the
common
fate
of
millions
of
millions
of
other
men
that
is
to
say
that
he
has
died
after
being
alive
how
much
more
must
it
be
requisite
to
establish
the
fact
so
antecedently
improbable
as
that
one
man
among
those
many
millions
after
having
died
came
back
to
life
and
yet
where
is
the
recorded
miracle
for
which
even
this
amount
of
testimony
is
forthcoming
why
are
miracles
so
constantly
performed
in
holes
and
corners
in
obscure
localities
among
little
knots
of
ignorant
and
enthusiastic
adherents
attested
by
the
vaguest
hearsay
evidence
of
unknown
or
incompetent
witnesses
and
apparently
under
circumstances
inevitably
calculated
to
defeat
their
object
and
engender
doubts
in
the
minds
of
reasonable
and
conscientious
men
take
for
instance
the
miracles
now
said
to
be
wrought
at
lourdes
the
object
must
be
taken
to
be
to
convert
infidel
france
to
the
catholic
faith
but
obviously
this
object
would
be
far
better
attained
by
a
single
undoubted
miracle
wrought
at
paris
before
a
commission
headed
by
a
man
like
pasteur
than
by
any
number
of
miracles
scarcely
if
at
all
distinguishable
from
those
of
braid
alleged
to
occur
at
an
obscure
village
in
the
presence
of
peasants
and
pilgrims
or
take
a
higher
instance
that
of
the
demand
made
by
the
pharisees
to
jesus
for
a
sign
to
attest
his
messiahship
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
see
if
it
is
at
all
possible
that
if
he
had
possessed
the
power
of
working
miracles
he
should
have
replied
doth
this
generation
seek
after
a
sign
verily
i
say
unto
you
there
shall
no
sign
be
given
unto
this
mark
ix
in
the
first
place
the
statement
throws
discredit
upon
all
the
miracles
said
to
have
been
wrought
by
the
positive
and
explicit
declaration
that
none
should
be
wrought
but
beyond
this
the
very
essence
of
the
mission
of
jesus
was
contained
in
the
words
ye
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
he
had
a
firm
conviction
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
or
a
millennium
of
peace
and
goodwill
was
close
at
hand
and
its
advent
only
retarded
by
the
sinfulness
and
want
of
faith
of
his
chosen
people
he
thought
it
his
bounden
duty
to
do
all
he
could
to
remove
the
obstacle
and
expedite
the
coming
of
the
kingdom
with
this
conviction
though
fully
seeing
the
risk
and
counting
the
cost
when
he
found
that
he
was
making
no
decided
headway
by
preaching
in
a
remote
province
he
determined
to
go
to
jerusalem
and
make
there
one
great
effort
to
accomplish
his
object
can
it
be
doubted
that
he
would
use
every
means
in
his
power
to
carry
his
mission
to
a
successful
conclusion
if
having
the
power
to
do
so
by
working
a
miracle
he
had
refused
he
would
from
his
point
of
view
have
been
guilty
of
a
great
of
preventing
the
coming
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
again
who
were
the
pharisees
no
doubt
there
were
formalists
and
hypocrites
among
them
but
the
position
of
the
sect
in
the
jewish
nation
was
almost
exactly
similar
to
that
of
the
english
puritans
in
the
reign
of
charles
they
were
the
embodiment
of
the
patriotic
and
religious
spirit
of
the
race
the
sons
of
the
heroic
fathers
who
fought
under
judas
maccabeus
against
antiochus
the
fathers
of
the
equally
heroic
sons
who
made
the
last
desperate
stand
against
the
legions
of
titus
it
was
their
duty
when
a
claim
to
messiahship
was
advanced
before
departing
from
the
traditions
of
their
ancestors
to
require
evidence
the
universally
expected
evidence
of
a
temporal
deliverer
being
wanting
there
remained
only
the
evidence
of
miracles
which
moreover
were
assigned
as
the
test
of
a
messiah
by
all
their
prophets
to
refuse
them
a
sign
if
a
sign
were
possible
was
to
do
injustice
to
many
sincere
and
conscientious
men
nay
more
it
was
an
act
of
cruelty
if
leaving
them
in
their
old
faith
entailed
eternal
punishment
the
same
thing
applies
to
all
records
of
miracles
they
are
never
wrought
under
circumstances
where
they
would
be
the
most
effective
means
for
attaining
proposed
ends
they
are
never
wrought
under
circumstances
which
leave
them
clear
of
the
suspicion
of
being
subjective
illusions
or
misinterpretations
of
effects
due
to
natural
causes
they
never
convince
any
but
those
who
are
more
than
half
convinced
already
it
would
be
easy
to
multiply
instances
showing
the
inadequacy
of
the
evidence
adduced
to
establish
such
an
exceptional
and
extraordinary
fact
as
the
occurrence
of
a
real
miracle
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
do
so
as
all
thinking
minds
have
come
or
are
fast
coming
to
the
conclusion
of
temple
that
the
countless
varieties
of
the
universe
were
provided
for
by
one
original
impress
and
not
by
special
acts
of
creation
modifying
what
had
previously
been
it
is
only
when
we
look
behind
the
phenomena
of
the
universe
at
this
great
first
cause
that
i
see
anything
to
object
to
in
the
definition
of
temple
and
of
christian
philosophers
generally
they
assume
it
to
be
a
personal
deity
who
is
to
a
great
extent
known
or
knowable
and
therefore
must
have
attributes
conformable
to
human
perceptions
which
are
the
basis
of
all
human
knowledge
in
other
words
however
much
we
may
purify
and
enlarge
these
attributes
he
must
be
essentially
an
anthropomorphic
god
or
magnified
man
to
this
theory
there
seems
to
me
to
be
this
fatal
objection
that
it
gives
no
account
of
the
origin
of
evil
or
rather
that
it
makes
the
divine
creator
directly
responsible
for
it
the
existence
of
evil
in
the
world
is
as
palpable
a
fact
as
the
existence
of
good
there
are
many
things
which
to
our
human
perceptions
appear
to
be
base
cruel
foul
and
ugly
just
as
clearly
as
other
things
appear
to
be
noble
merciful
pure
and
beautiful
whence
come
they
if
the
existence
of
good
proves
a
good
creator
how
can
we
escape
the
inference
that
the
existence
of
evil
proves
an
evil
one
this
is
never
so
forcibly
impressed
on
me
as
when
i
read
the
arguments
of
those
who
insist
most
strongly
on
the
conception
of
a
one
anthropomorphic
god
when
carlyle
says
that
is
good
generous
wise
i
deliberately
and
for
ever
love
in
others
and
or
what
could
by
any
possibility
have
given
it
to
me
but
one
who
first
had
it
to
give
this
is
not
logic
but
i
can
not
but
picture
to
myself
the
sledgehammer
force
with
which
if
he
had
approached
the
question
without
prepossessions
he
would
have
come
down
on
the
cant
the
insincerity
the
treason
to
the
eternal
veracities
which
refused
to
look
facts
in
the
face
and
apply
the
same
reasoning
to
the
evil
or
if
arnold
defines
the
deity
as
the
not
ourselves
which
makes
for
righteousness
how
of
the
something
not
ourselves
which
makes
for
unrighteousness
the
only
escape
i
can
find
from
this
dilemma
is
to
accept
existing
facts
and
not
evade
them
it
is
a
fact
that
polarity
is
the
law
of
existence
why
we
know
not
any
more
than
we
know
the
real
essence
and
origin
of
the
atoms
and
energies
which
are
our
other
ultimate
facts
but
we
accept
atoms
and
energies
and
accept
the
law
of
gravity
and
other
laws
why
not
accept
also
the
law
of
polarity
and
admit
that
it
is
part
of
the
one
of
the
fundamental
conditions
under
which
the
evolution
of
creation
from
its
ultimate
elements
is
necessitated
to
proceed
this
the
human
mind
can
understand
beyond
it
is
the
great
unknown
or
unknowable
in
presence
of
which
we
can
only
feel
emotions
of
reverence
and
of
awe
and
trust
the
larger
that
duality
may
somehow
ultimately
be
merged
in
unity
evil
in
good
and
winter
turn
to
as
nations
advanced
in
civilisation
there
has
always
been
a
tendency
among
the
higher
and
purer
minds
to
relegate
the
great
first
cause
further
and
further
back
into
the
unknown
and
to
divest
it
of
anthropomorphic
attributes
when
socrates
said
divinely
revealed
wisdom
of
which
you
speak
i
deny
not
inasmuch
as
i
do
not
know
it
i
can
only
understand
human
reason
he
spoke
the
identical
language
of
darwin
spencer
huxley
and
those
leaders
of
modern
thought
whom
theologians
call
agnostics
even
in
religions
based
on
the
idea
of
a
single
anthropomorphic
deity
the
same
tendency
often
appears
among
the
highest
thinkers
thus
emmanuel
deutsch
in
his
learned
work
on
the
talmud
tells
us
first
chapter
treats
of
the
deity
as
conceived
by
jewish
philosophy
the
existence
of
god
is
of
course
presupposed
but
what
of
his
attributes
has
he
any
scripture
literally
taken
seems
to
affirm
this
yet
taken
in
a
higher
sense
as
understood
by
the
alexandrines
the
talmud
and
the
targum
it
denies
the
great
jewish
doctors
ibn
ezra
jehuda
hilmi
and
maimonides
take
this
view
of
a
divine
origin
shrouded
in
ineffable
mystery
maimonides
says
you
give
attributes
to
a
thing
you
define
this
thing
and
defining
a
thing
means
to
bring
it
under
some
head
to
compare
it
with
something
like
it
god
is
sole
of
his
kind
determine
him
circumscribe
him
and
you
bring
him
down
to
the
modes
and
categories
of
created
even
paul
says
the
depths
of
god
how
unsearchable
are
his
judgments
and
how
inscrutable
his
and
the
creed
of
our
own
church
in
the
midst
of
a
string
of
definitions
all
implying
that
god
is
comprehensible
has
the
words
father
it
is
evident
that
the
reasons
why
these
anticipations
of
the
prevailing
tendency
of
modern
thought
only
appeared
by
glimpses
and
among
a
very
limited
number
of
philosophic
minds
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
miraculous
theory
of
the
universe
everywhere
prevailed
every
unusual
occurrence
was
supposed
to
be
owing
to
the
direct
supernatural
interference
of
a
being
acting
in
the
main
with
human
attributes
and
therefore
to
be
a
direct
refutation
of
the
theory
which
denied
the
possibility
of
defining
his
attributes
and
relegated
him
to
the
dim
distance
of
an
incomprehensible
creator
with
the
utter
breakdown
of
the
miraculous
theory
and
the
certainty
that
all
the
countless
varieties
of
the
universe
arise
not
from
special
interferences
but
from
one
original
impress
this
theory
of
a
reverent
and
devout
agnosticism
becomes
impregnable
and
holds
the
field
against
all
rivals
it
and
it
alone
is
consistent
with
the
facts
of
science
the
deductions
of
reason
the
axioms
of
morality
while
at
the
same
time
it
denies
nothing
and
leaves
an
ample
background
on
which
to
paint
the
visions
of
faith
and
to
reflect
back
to
us
spectral
images
of
our
hopes
and
fears
our
longings
and
aspirations
some
seek
for
a
solution
of
the
mystery
and
try
to
reconcile
the
existence
of
evil
with
that
of
an
almighty
and
beneficent
creator
by
assuming
that
in
the
long
run
everything
will
come
right
evolution
they
say
has
led
constantly
to
higher
and
better
things
and
when
carried
far
enough
will
lead
to
a
state
of
society
in
which
wars
will
cease
evil
passions
die
out
and
universal
love
and
charity
other
words
to
a
millennium
even
if
this
were
true
what
of
the
untold
millions
of
the
human
race
who
have
perished
in
their
sins
while
evolution
was
slowly
working
out
this
tardy
millennium
are
they
the
√†
whom
a
deity
sacrifices
with
cynical
indifference
in
the
calculated
moves
of
the
game
of
creation
is
this
their
idea
of
an
and
father
who
is
in
heaven
and
again
is
it
true
that
evolution
works
constantly
for
good
and
promises
to
bring
about
such
a
millennium
it
is
doubtless
true
that
evolution
means
progress
and
the
development
of
the
more
and
more
complex
and
differentiated
from
the
simple
and
uniform
but
is
this
all
for
good
or
all
for
happiness
and
is
not
evolution
like
everything
else
subject
to
the
primary
and
law
of
polarity
we
have
only
to
ask
the
question
to
answer
it
in
the
case
of
the
individual
which
is
the
epitome
of
the
history
of
the
species
is
development
from
the
engaging
innocence
of
childhood
always
in
the
direction
of
goodness
and
happiness
so
far
is
this
from
being
the
case
that
as
individuals
and
societies
advance
and
become
higher
and
more
complex
in
the
scale
of
organisation
the
law
of
polarity
asserts
itself
with
force
and
contrasts
become
sharper
the
good
become
better
the
bad
worse
and
as
we
become
less
like
the
beasts
with
lower
pleasures
like
the
beasts
with
lower
pains
if
our
happiness
becomes
more
intense
so
does
our
misery
become
more
intolerable
i
refer
not
merely
to
physical
conditions
though
here
the
contrast
is
most
apparent
an
intelligent
traveller
who
recently
circled
the
world
surveying
mankind
with
a
keen
and
impartial
eye
china
to
peru
says
as
the
result
of
his
experience
traveller
will
not
see
in
all
his
wanderings
so
much
abject
repulsive
misery
among
human
beings
in
the
most
heathen
lands
as
that
which
startles
him
in
his
civilised
christian
home
for
nowhere
are
the
extremes
of
wealth
and
poverty
so
painfully
this
is
perfectly
true
but
it
would
be
a
rash
conclusion
to
infer
that
civilised
and
christian
countries
are
worse
than
heathen
lands
or
that
those
who
march
in
the
van
of
progress
and
succeed
in
the
struggle
for
life
have
a
larger
dose
of
original
sin
than
the
laggards
and
those
who
fail
accumulations
of
population
and
accumulations
of
capital
are
alike
causes
and
effects
of
progress
in
an
industrial
age
but
you
can
no
more
have
a
north
without
a
south
pole
than
you
can
have
this
progress
without
its
counterpart
of
suffering
when
an
educated
gentleman
was
like
the
good
vicar
passing
rich
with
forty
pounds
a
year
how
many
struggles
and
how
many
were
avoided
when
dwelt
in
rural
hamlets
and
villages
the
of
east
london
could
scarcely
have
been
written
turn
it
as
you
like
increase
of
population
means
increase
of
poverty
say
that
only
five
per
cent
fail
in
the
battle
of
life
from
their
own
or
inherited
faults
from
bad
luck
weakness
of
mind
adverse
surroundings
five
per
cent
on
thirty
millions
is
a
larger
figure
than
five
per
cent
on
ten
millions
and
the
lot
of
those
who
fail
is
aggravated
by
the
success
of
those
who
succeed
the
scale
of
living
rises
and
the
cost
of
living
increases
while
competition
becomes
keener
increase
of
population
in
a
limited
area
means
increased
difficulty
of
finding
employment
and
the
complex
relations
of
international
commerce
send
panics
and
crises
vibrating
throughout
the
world
which
throw
millions
out
of
work
or
reduce
them
to
starvation
wages
in
simple
forms
of
society
every
one
accepts
the
condition
in
which
he
finds
himself
as
a
matter
of
course
while
in
a
more
complex
civilisation
the
fiend
envy
steps
in
and
teaches
the
baser
natures
who
are
failures
to
regard
every
success
as
an
insult
and
every
successful
man
as
an
enemy
hence
labour
rises
in
mad
revolt
against
capital
socialists
attack
society
with
dynamite
and
utopian
theorists
preach
a
millennium
to
be
attained
by
abolishing
private
property
and
individual
liberty
if
we
turn
to
the
moral
aspects
of
the
question
it
is
still
more
clear
that
evolution
does
not
tend
solely
to
the
side
of
virtue
there
is
doubtless
less
ferocious
savagery
less
rude
and
unconscious
or
crime
in
civilised
societies
but
there
is
far
more
deliberate
and
diabolical
wickedness
the
very
temptations
and
opportunities
which
if
resisted
lead
to
higher
virtues
if
succumbed
to
lead
to
greater
vice
even
the
intellectual
advance
if
perverted
becomes
the
instrument
of
greater
crimes
a
chemist
discovers
and
dynamite
becomes
a
resource
of
civilisation
there
is
a
saying
that
there
is
blackguard
so
bad
as
a
scotch
blackguard
which
as
a
patriotic
scotchman
i
take
to
be
a
tribute
to
the
generally
high
intellectual
and
moral
character
of
my
countrymen
a
powerful
polarity
is
powerful
as
the
case
may
be
either
for
good
or
evil
why
then
should
we
believe
that
evolution
which
carried
thus
far
has
developed
more
strongly
the
contrast
between
good
and
evil
will
if
carried
a
little
farther
extinguish
it
by
annihilating
the
evil
in
fact
the
good
and
evil
resulting
from
the
higher
evolution
of
society
are
so
equally
balanced
that
it
depends
very
much
on
place
time
and
temperament
whether
we
are
optimists
or
pessimists
if
my
liver
acts
properly
i
am
an
optimist
if
it
is
out
of
order
a
pessimist
personally
i
incline
to
is
i
think
that
this
world
if
not
exactly
best
of
all
possible
worlds
is
yet
on
the
whole
a
very
tolerable
world
and
that
life
to
the
majority
and
on
the
average
is
worth
living
i
think
also
that
progress
is
certainly
towards
higher
and
very
probably
towards
happier
conditions
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
most
advanced
communities
the
condition
of
at
least
one
the
female
the
population
is
distinctly
better
and
that
the
working
class
who
form
the
majority
of
the
male
half
though
many
are
worse
off
than
formerly
are
on
the
whole
better
fed
better
clothed
better
educated
and
better
behaved
this
however
is
perhaps
very
much
a
matter
of
temperament
greater
minds
than
mine
have
seen
things
differently
and
inclined
to
pessimism
buddhism
and
almost
all
oriental
religions
and
philosophies
are
based
upon
it
and
look
to
nirvana
or
annihilation
of
personal
identity
as
the
supreme
bliss
pauline
christianity
assumes
that
all
mankind
except
a
few
chosen
vessels
are
so
hopelessly
bad
as
to
be
predestined
to
eternal
damnation
and
even
more
remarkable
shakespeare
the
universal
genius
who
one
would
say
had
as
happy
a
temperament
and
led
as
successful
a
life
as
any
man
had
his
moods
of
despondency
in
which
he
could
say
when
in
disgrace
with
fortune
and
eyes
i
all
alone
bemoan
my
outcast
state
wearying
deaf
heaven
with
my
fruitless
cries
and
look
upon
myself
and
my
or
declare
with
hamlet
that
no
one
would
bear
the
ills
of
life
if
he
himself
could
his
quietus
make
with
a
bare
bodkin
with
instances
like
these
and
the
disgust
of
life
manifested
in
so
many
modern
societies
by
the
increase
of
suicides
and
the
spread
of
pessimistic
theories
like
those
of
schopenhauer
and
hartmann
who
can
deny
that
the
great
magnet
of
modern
civilisation
has
a
south
as
well
as
a
north
pole
and
that
progress
is
not
all
towards
perfection
the
attempts
of
theologians
to
reconcile
the
existence
of
evil
with
the
goodness
of
an
almighty
creator
by
relegating
the
adjustment
to
a
future
life
only
make
the
fact
of
this
fundamental
polarity
more
apparent
for
their
conceptions
of
a
heaven
and
a
hell
obviously
do
not
reconcile
but
only
intensify
the
opposite
polarities
the
good
are
better
the
bad
worse
the
happy
happier
and
the
wretched
more
miserable
in
all
these
attempts
to
define
the
undefinable
and
to
reconcile
divine
justice
with
divine
mercy
all
that
remains
really
clear
to
each
individual
is
that
by
his
efforts
in
this
life
he
can
do
something
to
keep
the
balance
of
polarities
somewhat
more
on
the
side
of
good
both
in
his
own
individual
existence
and
in
that
of
the
aggregate
of
units
of
which
he
is
one
which
is
called
society
or
humanity
the
great
advantage
of
this
form
of
religious
hypothesis
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
i
call
zoroastrianism
is
that
in
the
first
place
it
gets
rid
of
the
antagonism
between
religion
and
science
for
there
is
no
possible
discovery
of
science
which
is
irreconcilable
with
the
fact
that
there
is
a
necessary
and
inevitable
polarity
of
good
and
evil
and
in
the
background
a
great
unknown
which
may
be
regarded
with
those
feelings
and
aspirations
which
are
inseparable
from
human
nature
and
secondly
there
is
the
still
greater
advantage
that
we
can
devote
ourselves
with
a
whole
heart
and
sincere
mind
to
the
worship
of
the
good
principle
without
paltering
with
our
moral
nature
by
professing
to
love
and
adore
a
being
who
is
the
author
of
all
the
evil
and
misery
in
the
world
as
well
as
of
the
good
if
it
were
really
true
that
there
were
such
a
being
as
theologians
describe
who
created
the
immense
majority
of
the
human
race
vessels
of
wrath
doomed
to
eternal
punishment
either
from
pure
caprice
or
to
avenge
the
slight
offered
to
him
by
the
disobedience
of
a
remote
ancestor
what
would
be
the
attitude
of
every
healthy
human
soul
towards
such
a
being
rather
that
of
prometheus
or
satan
than
of
gabriel
or
michael
of
heroic
defiance
than
of
abject
submission
we
may
gloss
this
over
in
words
but
the
fact
remains
and
it
is
difficult
to
overestimate
the
amount
of
evil
which
has
resulted
in
the
world
from
this
confusion
of
moral
sentiments
which
has
made
good
men
do
work
in
the
belief
that
it
had
divine
sanction
the
horrors
of
demonology
and
witchcraft
had
their
origin
in
texts
of
the
old
testament
religious
wars
and
persecutions
arose
out
of
the
fundamental
error
that
intellectual
acceptance
of
doubtful
dogmas
was
the
one
thing
necessary
for
salvation
and
ruthless
cruelty
was
justified
by
an
appeal
to
anger
with
saul
for
refusing
to
hew
in
pieces
the
captive
amalekites
a
follower
of
zoroaster
would
see
at
once
that
these
were
works
of
ahriman
and
not
of
ormuzd
and
that
in
taking
part
in
them
he
was
deserting
the
standard
under
which
he
had
enlisted
and
doing
deeds
of
darkness
while
pretending
to
serve
the
prince
of
light
this
idea
of
being
a
soldier
enlisted
in
the
army
of
light
seems
to
me
to
afford
one
of
the
strongest
practical
inducements
to
hate
what
is
evil
and
cleave
to
what
is
good
a
bad
deed
or
foul
thought
is
felt
to
be
not
only
wrong
but
dishonourable
a
disloyal
going
over
to
the
enemy
and
abandonment
of
the
chief
under
whom
we
had
enlisted
and
of
the
comrades
with
whom
we
had
served
this
is
a
very
strong
motive
and
even
in
the
humble
ranks
of
the
salvation
army
we
can
see
how
powerfully
it
operates
to
make
men
true
to
their
banner
indeed
a
great
deal
of
what
is
best
in
genuine
christianity
seems
to
me
to
resolve
itself
very
much
into
the
worship
of
jesus
as
the
ormuzd
or
personification
of
the
good
principle
and
determination
to
try
to
follow
his
example
and
do
his
work
it
happens
to
me
to
receive
a
good
many
circulars
from
the
devoted
men
and
women
who
are
doing
so
much
charitable
work
to
assist
the
poor
and
fallen
and
i
observe
that
the
appeals
are
almost
constantly
made
in
the
name
of
jesus
when
the
salvation
army
made
an
appeal
the
other
day
to
its
members
for
funds
to
prosecute
their
campaign
it
was
touching
to
read
the
replies
and
see
men
parting
with
an
overcoat
or
giving
up
their
beer
and
women
going
without
a
new
bonnet
or
cup
of
tea
to
contribute
their
mite
but
always
for
the
of
jesus
for
the
sake
as
an
offering
to
the
theological
christianity
says
that
the
one
thing
needful
is
to
believe
in
the
catholic
faith
as
defined
by
the
athanasian
creed
without
which
we
shall
doubt
perish
practical
christianity
has
completely
dropped
the
holy
ghost
as
a
sort
of
fifth
wheel
to
the
coach
and
relegated
the
father
into
ever
vaguer
and
greater
distance
while
it
has
fastened
more
and
more
on
the
figure
of
jesus
of
nazareth
as
the
practical
living
embodiment
of
the
good
principle
of
the
universe
in
a
word
christianity
as
it
has
become
more
reasonable
more
charitable
more
pure
and
more
elevated
has
approximated
more
and
more
to
zoroastrianism
and
for
practical
purposes
modern
christians
are
to
a
great
extent
without
knowing
it
worshippers
of
ormuzd
with
christ
for
their
ormuzd
to
this
i
see
no
sort
of
objection
the
tendency
to
personify
abstract
principles
in
something
which
is
warmer
dearer
nearer
to
ourselves
is
ineradicable
in
human
nature
and
especially
among
the
great
masses
of
mankind
who
can
not
rise
to
the
height
of
philosophical
speculations
it
is
impossible
in
the
present
age
to
invent
new
personifications
or
to
revive
old
ones
jesus
has
the
immense
advantage
of
being
in
possession
of
the
field
with
all
the
accumulated
love
and
reverence
of
nineteen
centuries
of
followers
it
would
be
difficult
to
invent
a
better
ideal
or
a
more
perfect
example
no
doubt
the
ideal
like
all
human
conceptions
is
not
absolutely
perfect
it
is
subject
to
the
law
of
polarity
and
its
excellences
if
pushed
to
the
of
extremes
in
many
cases
become
faults
it
would
not
do
in
practice
if
smitten
on
one
cheek
to
turn
the
other
or
to
take
no
thought
for
the
morrow
and
live
like
the
sparrows
the
opposition
between
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
is
also
stated
so
absolutely
that
it
is
apt
to
lead
to
a
barren
and
ignoble
asceticism
but
those
are
elements
which
practically
are
not
likely
to
be
pushed
to
excess
and
which
serve
rather
to
mitigate
the
tendencies
of
modern
civilisation
to
an
undue
preponderance
of
the
opposite
polarities
of
selfishness
worldliness
and
sensuality
courage
hardihood
foresight
a
love
of
progress
and
a
desire
to
attain
independence
will
always
remain
prominent
virtues
especially
of
the
stronger
races
and
the
gentler
teachings
of
christianity
will
long
be
wanted
as
an
influence
to
soften
to
elevate
and
to
purify
by
all
means
therefore
let
christians
remain
christians
and
see
in
christ
their
ormuzd
or
personification
of
the
good
principle
only
let
them
remember
that
there
are
two
sides
to
every
question
and
cease
to
entertain
hard
and
bitter
thoughts
towards
those
who
follow
the
truth
after
a
different
fashion
let
them
delight
rather
to
discover
unity
in
the
spirit
than
differences
in
the
letter
and
instead
of
anathematising
with
athanasius
those
who
dissent
by
one
breadth
from
the
catholic
faith
strive
with
paul
after
that
charity
which
long
and
is
kind
beareth
all
things
believeth
all
things
hopeth
all
things
endureth
all
this
will
be
easier
if
they
recollect
that
love
and
reverence
for
jesus
as
the
personification
of
the
good
principle
is
in
no
way
connected
with
the
supernatural
dogmas
and
legends
which
have
come
down
from
superstitious
ages
and
which
are
seen
every
day
more
and
more
clearly
to
stand
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
real
facts
and
real
laws
of
the
universe
he
is
the
bright
example
of
the
highest
ideal
of
human
virtue
not
on
account
of
miracles
but
in
spite
of
them
not
because
he
was
a
transcendental
abstraction
with
attributes
altogether
outside
of
human
experience
or
conception
but
because
he
was
a
man
whom
other
men
can
love
and
other
men
can
strive
to
imitate
the
dogmas
and
miracles
may
quietly
fade
out
of
sight
as
so
many
articles
of
the
athanasian
creed
have
already
done
like
mists
before
the
rising
rays
of
larger
knowledge
and
purer
morality
and
yet
the
essence
of
christianity
will
remain
as
a
worship
of
the
good
and
beautiful
personified
in
the
brightest
example
which
has
been
of
jesus
the
son
of
the

christianity
and
morals
christianity
based
on
of
in
in
of
of
suspended
in
certain
states
of
and
animal
of
by
conclusion
the
great
advantage
which
christianity
possesses
over
most
other
religions
is
that
it
is
based
to
a
much
greater
extent
on
the
solid
foundation
of
an
elevated
morality
the
creeds
of
ancient
egypt
of
buddhism
and
of
confucianism
contain
many
excellent
moral
precepts
and
the
injunctions
to
unto
others
as
you
would
be
done
by
and
to
your
neighbour
as
yourself
are
to
be
found
long
before
the
sermon
on
the
mount
but
these
religions
in
the
main
followed
other
lines
of
development
and
branched
off
either
into
metaphysical
conceptions
or
into
formal
rites
and
ceremonies
with
the
exception
of
judaism
of
which
christianity
is
the
lineal
descendant
no
religion
has
ever
to
the
same
extent
become
to
the
great
mass
of
its
adherents
a
rule
of
conduct
and
an
incentive
strengthened
by
divine
sanction
to
lead
pure
and
upright
lives
this
is
the
sense
in
which
christianity
has
always
been
understood
by
the
vast
majority
of
christians
and
its
corruptions
have
come
much
more
from
above
than
from
below
from
theologians
priests
and
politicians
than
from
the
instincts
of
the
millions
and
this
it
is
which
enables
it
to
retain
such
a
wonderful
vitality
even
in
modern
times
when
faith
in
dogmas
and
miracles
has
been
so
greatly
weakened
in
order
to
appreciate
the
solidity
of
this
basis
it
is
necessary
to
understand
the
origin
of
morals
and
to
see
that
the
fundamental
precepts
of
moral
law
are
not
mere
chance
inventions
of
a
few
exceptional
minds
or
the
teachings
of
doubtful
revelations
but
are
the
necessary
growth
and
products
of
human
nature
in
the
course
of
the
evolution
of
society
from
rude
beginnings
to
a
high
civilisation
this
gives
them
a
certainty
and
sanction
which
could
be
derived
from
no
other
source
and
makes
them
what
in
fact
they
have
primary
instincts
of
the
natural
and
normal
mind
in
civilised
communities
i
proceed
therefore
to
endeavour
to
trace
shortly
the
process
by
which
moral
laws
have
originated
and
grown
up
to
their
present
certainty
and
cogency
in
the
course
of
evolution
as
i
have
already
said
the
element
of
morality
is
one
of
the
latest
to
be
developed
in
religious
conceptions
the
first
impressions
of
savage
races
reflect
the
feelings
of
vague
superstitious
terror
with
which
they
regard
unknown
phenomena
and
powers
they
are
afraid
of
ghosts
and
afraid
of
thunder
long
before
they
rise
to
a
belief
in
a
future
state
of
rewards
and
punishments
or
to
the
notion
of
an
almighty
being
acting
by
natural
laws
in
a
higher
state
of
development
they
personify
natural
powers
in
gods
who
have
no
more
idea
of
morality
than
if
they
were
so
many
parallels
of
latitude
or
degrees
of
longitude
and
they
invent
tribal
gods
who
are
simply
great
chiefs
bound
by
no
laws
but
granting
favours
when
appeased
and
inflicting
injuries
when
angry
by
slow
degrees
as
civilisation
advances
moral
ideas
are
evolved
and
the
more
enlightened
minds
begin
to
attribute
moral
attributes
to
their
deities
earnest
men
prophets
and
reformers
take
up
these
ideas
and
preach
them
to
the
world
and
if
circumstances
are
favourable
and
the
soil
prepared
they
take
root
and
become
popular
convictions
surviving
in
the
struggle
for
life
and
becoming
stronger
from
generation
to
generation
this
evolution
of
moral
ideas
is
most
clearly
traced
in
the
religious
history
of
the
jews
in
their
earlier
conceptions
jehovah
is
represented
with
all
the
traits
of
a
jealous
and
capricious
oriental
sultan
the
one
virtue
in
his
eyes
is
implicit
obedience
the
one
unpardonable
crime
anything
that
looks
like
disrespect
david
is
the
man
after
own
heart
though
he
commits
crimes
of
the
foulest
description
and
treats
as
nullities
the
moral
commandments
against
adultery
and
murder
but
when
he
takes
a
census
of
his
people
jehovah
is
offended
and
with
a
total
disregard
of
justice
visits
his
anger
not
on
the
offender
but
on
the
innocent
people
whom
he
decimates
by
a
pestilence
in
like
manner
abraham
is
favoured
because
he
is
ready
to
obey
the
inhuman
command
to
sacrifice
his
son
while
saul
loses
favour
because
he
hesitates
to
massacre
his
captives
in
cold
blood
the
first
ideas
of
a
higher
moral
sense
appear
with
the
prophets
in
the
troubled
times
of
the
later
poor
little
palestine
was
being
ground
between
the
upper
millstone
of
assyria
and
the
nether
one
of
egypt
sufferings
and
persecutions
anxieties
and
tribulations
wrought
a
ferment
in
the
jewish
mind
from
which
new
ideas
were
generated
sacrifices
had
been
duly
offered
and
yet
the
enemies
of
jehovah
waxed
and
his
chosen
people
waned
it
must
be
that
he
was
offended
with
them
because
he
required
something
better
than
the
blood
of
and
mercy
so
taught
the
popular
preachers
of
the
like
isaiah
and
by
degrees
their
words
found
acceptance
it
was
not
however
until
the
captivity
that
these
ideas
of
morality
were
wrought
into
the
jewish
nation
so
as
to
become
so
to
speak
flesh
of
their
flesh
and
blood
of
their
blood
as
they
have
remained
ever
since
whether
it
was
contact
with
the
more
advanced
moral
ideas
of
religions
like
those
of
buddha
and
zoroaster
or
more
probably
their
sufferings
from
the
cruelty
and
injustice
of
their
conquerors
the
captivity
certainly
made
them
a
new
nation
attached
ardently
to
morality
and
effecting
in
a
few
years
and
by
purely
human
agencies
what
according
to
received
beliefs
centuries
of
miraculous
dispensation
had
failed
to
accomplish
how
speedily
and
how
effectually
the
work
was
done
appears
from
that
most
interesting
narrative
of
the
domestic
life
of
a
jew
of
nineveh
the
book
of
tobit
the
simple
piety
and
homely
household
virtues
are
almost
identically
the
same
as
those
of
many
a
jewish
family
living
in
london
or
frankfort
from
that
time
forward
jewish
morality
maintains
a
high
level
and
in
the
age
immediately
preceding
christianity
it
had
attained
great
purity
and
spirituality
in
the
school
of
the
early
doctors
of
the
talmud
and
of
the
jewish
colony
of
alexandria
the
sermon
on
the
mount
beautiful
as
it
is
is
but
an
admirable
of
maxims
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
works
of
philo
and
other
jewish
teachers
and
which
were
current
in
the
synagogues
of
the
day
hillel
who
was
president
of
the
sanhedrin
when
christ
was
born
when
asked
what
was
the
law
replied
not
unto
another
what
thou
wouldst
not
have
another
do
unto
thee
this
is
the
whole
law
the
rest
is
mere
and
again
not
judge
thy
neighbour
until
thou
hast
stood
in
his
the
talmud
anticipates
in
a
wonderful
degree
not
only
the
moral
precepts
of
the
gospel
but
to
a
great
extent
its
phraseology
and
technical
terms
of
man
of
god
of
heaven
were
all
as
deutsch
shows
not
invented
by
christianity
but
were
household
words
of
contemporary
judaism
in
one
respect
only
christianity
shows
a
higher
evolution
of
morality
than
its
universality
pure
judaism
hardly
rises
above
the
idea
of
or
those
who
were
of
the
same
race
or
common
faith
while
christianity
as
enlarged
by
paul
embraces
all
mankind
and
may
truly
say
nihil
a
me
alienum
the
idea
that
morality
and
religion
are
products
of
a
slowly
developing
evolution
is
denounced
by
many
as
degrading
and
materialistic
in
many
the
instinct
of
the
is
so
strong
that
it
seems
to
them
sacrilege
to
attempt
to
explain
it
they
insist
that
it
is
either
a
universal
instinct
implanted
from
the
first
in
all
mankind
or
else
that
it
has
been
so
implanted
by
a
divine
revelation
they
forget
that
to
use
the
vigorous
phraseology
of
carlyle
matters
not
whether
you
call
a
thing
or
what
really
concerns
us
is
to
know
whether
it
is
now
it
admits
of
no
question
that
whether
we
like
it
or
not
the
evolutionist
theory
of
morality
is
the
true
one
take
an
extreme
instance
that
of
murder
we
feel
an
instinctive
horror
at
the
idea
and
even
a
brutal
ruffian
like
bill
sikes
becomes
an
accursed
thing
to
himself
and
his
companions
when
he
has
transgressed
the
commandment
shalt
do
no
but
is
it
so
everywhere
and
was
it
so
always
by
no
means
the
fiji
islander
kills
and
eats
a
stranger
or
enemy
without
scruple
the
red
indian
and
the
dyak
are
not
accounted
men
until
they
have
murdered
some
one
and
brought
home
his
scalp
or
his
head
as
a
trophy
even
at
a
late
period
among
ourselves
murder
was
considered
to
be
rather
as
a
civil
injury
to
be
met
by
compensation
than
as
a
crime
and
a
regular
tariff
was
established
of
the
amount
to
be
paid
according
as
the
victim
was
a
slave
or
a
freeman
the
origin
and
progress
of
the
idea
that
murder
is
a
crime
can
almost
be
traced
step
by
step
the
wife
of
a
rude
savage
does
something
which
offends
him
a
violent
perception
of
anger
flashes
from
the
visual
organ
to
the
perceptive
area
of
the
brain
and
a
reflex
action
flashes
from
it
along
the
motor
nerve
to
the
muscles
of
the
arm
he
strikes
and
kills
her
almost
as
unconsciously
and
instinctively
as
he
walks
or
breathes
but
other
perceptions
follow
on
the
act
he
finds
next
day
that
he
has
no
one
to
cook
his
food
the
image
of
her
dying
face
photographed
on
his
brain
is
an
unpleasant
one
and
thus
by
degrees
a
series
of
secondary
perceptions
get
attached
to
the
primary
one
of
striking
when
he
feels
angry
if
he
gets
another
wife
who
again
provokes
him
the
primary
perception
calls
up
the
secondary
ones
and
the
of
his
brain
instead
of
being
solicited
only
in
one
direction
are
acted
on
in
opposite
ways
by
conflicting
impressions
he
hesitates
and
as
the
primary
impulse
of
passion
is
probably
the
more
evanescent
the
restraining
impulses
prevail
and
every
time
they
prevail
they
acquire
more
strength
gradually
they
extend
to
a
conviction
that
it
is
both
inconvenient
and
disagreeable
to
kill
any
one
with
whom
he
is
closely
related
either
by
family
or
tribal
ties
and
that
in
a
word
murder
does
not
pay
and
is
wrong
unless
practised
on
an
enemy
this
idea
accumulates
by
heredity
and
evidently
those
tribes
or
races
in
whom
it
is
strongest
will
have
an
advantage
in
the
struggle
for
life
and
be
most
likely
to
survive
from
this
point
the
idea
may
be
traced
historically
deepening
and
widening
from
generation
to
generation
as
civilisation
advances
until
in
the
higher
races
it
assumes
the
form
of
an
instinctive
abhorrence
of
murder
in
the
abstract
as
we
find
it
at
the
present
day
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
foundations
of
morality
are
in
any
way
weakened
by
thus
tracing
them
up
to
their
first
origins
on
the
contrary
if
we
consider
the
matter
rightly
they
are
placed
on
a
much
more
solid
and
unassailable
basis
if
we
say
that
moral
laws
depend
on
a
universal
instinct
implanted
in
all
mankind
faith
in
them
is
shaken
whenever
we
read
in
history
or
hear
from
the
report
of
travellers
of
whole
nations
constituting
from
first
to
last
the
immense
majority
of
the
human
race
who
had
none
of
those
ideas
which
we
now
consider
fundamental
if
again
we
base
them
on
divine
precepts
miraculously
conveyed
every
discovery
of
science
and
development
of
thought
which
weakens
faith
in
miracles
impairs
the
basis
of
morals
and
on
this
theory
hopeless
contradictions
arise
within
the
sphere
of
those
very
moral
laws
which
we
seek
to
establish
as
in
reconciling
the
justice
and
mercy
of
the
creator
in
revealing
this
inspired
code
only
to
limited
portions
of
the
human
race
and
under
conditions
which
leave
large
scope
for
legitimate
doubt
and
which
in
point
of
fact
failed
to
ensure
recognition
for
its
moral
precepts
among
his
own
chosen
people
for
a
long
period
after
its
promulgation
but
on
the
scientific
theory
of
the
evolution
of
morality
by
natural
laws
it
stands
on
an
impregnable
footing
no
one
can
deny
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
such
instincts
do
prevail
and
have
become
part
of
the
nature
of
all
the
best
men
and
best
races
and
that
each
successive
generation
tends
to
fix
them
more
firmly
mathematical
laws
are
not
the
less
certain
because
they
can
be
traced
back
to
counting
on
the
fingers
and
moral
laws
will
continue
to
have
a
certainty
and
cogency
scarcely
inferior
to
the
axioms
of
mathematics
although
we
can
trace
them
back
to
origins
as
rude
as
the
attempts
of
the
australian
savage
to
extend
his
perceptions
of
number
beyond
two
and
a
great
the
real
difficulty
is
not
in
tracing
the
origin
of
these
instincts
of
morality
but
in
that
fundamental
difficulty
which
underlies
all
theories
of
reconciling
the
consciousness
of
with
the
material
attributes
with
which
it
is
indissolubly
associated
without
freedom
of
will
there
can
be
no
conscience
no
right
or
wrong
in
acting
in
accordance
or
otherwise
with
the
instincts
of
moral
law
however
those
instincts
may
have
been
derived
now
it
is
certain
that
the
will
like
life
memory
consciousness
and
other
mental
functions
is
so
far
as
human
knowledge
extends
indissolubly
connected
with
matter
and
natural
laws
in
the
form
of
certain
motions
of
the
cells
which
form
the
grey
substance
of
the
nerves
and
of
the
nervous
ganglia
of
which
the
cortex
of
the
brain
is
the
most
considerable
this
is
conclusively
proved
by
experiment
we
know
that
by
removing
certain
portions
of
the
brain
of
a
dog
or
of
a
pigeon
we
can
destroy
the
power
of
motion
while
preserving
the
will
and
by
removing
certain
other
portions
we
can
destroy
the
will
while
preserving
the
powers
of
motion
take
away
a
certain
portion
of
the
brain
of
a
pigeon
and
although
it
retains
the
power
of
taking
food
it
has
so
totally
lost
the
will
to
exercise
this
power
that
it
will
starve
in
the
midst
of
abundance
though
it
can
be
kept
alive
by
placing
the
food
in
its
mouth
in
like
manner
in
the
human
brain
there
are
certain
portions
which
if
destroyed
by
injury
or
disease
will
paralyse
the
power
of
giving
effect
to
the
will
by
muscular
movements
while
the
destruction
of
other
portions
will
paralyse
the
will
which
originates
such
movements
numerous
cases
are
recorded
in
medical
treatises
in
which
the
will
is
completely
paralysed
for
the
performance
of
certain
functions
and
in
such
cases
the
anatomist
can
lay
his
finger
on
the
spot
where
the
brain
is
affected
and
when
the
brain
is
dissected
after
the
death
of
the
patient
it
will
be
found
that
his
prediction
is
verified
and
that
this
region
of
the
brain
really
was
diseased
in
sleep
also
and
in
abnormal
states
of
the
brain
such
as
somnambulism
and
mesmerism
or
hypnotism
the
action
of
the
will
is
suspended
hypnotism
affords
the
most
remarkable
instances
for
here
the
will
seems
to
be
transferred
from
the
ego
or
individuality
of
the
patient
to
that
of
the
operator
and
the
currents
of
nervous
energy
which
induce
motion
in
a
are
set
going
by
impulses
in
the
mind
of
a
not
caused
by
his
own
will
but
by
that
of
b
conveyed
by
words
gestures
or
other
subtle
indications
a
ludicrous
instance
of
this
is
recorded
by
braid
in
which
an
old
lady
who
had
a
true
puritanical
abhorrence
of
dancing
as
sinful
being
hypnotised
began
capering
about
the
room
when
a
waltz
tune
was
struck
up
on
being
told
to
do
so
by
the
operators
there
are
some
other
curious
effects
produced
by
hypnotism
in
the
way
of
inducing
a
sort
of
double
consciousness
and
memory
which
makes
people
in
this
condition
totally
forget
things
which
they
remember
when
awake
and
remember
things
which
were
totally
forgotten
in
the
waking
state
these
and
a
variety
of
other
instances
point
to
the
conclusion
that
man
is
only
a
conscious
machine
in
other
words
that
the
original
impress
to
use
words
was
so
perfect
that
it
provided
a
harmony
not
only
for
the
innumerable
phenomena
of
the
material
universe
as
unfolded
by
evolution
but
for
the
still
more
innumerable
phenomena
of
life
in
all
its
manifestations
and
all
its
complex
relations
to
outward
environment
i
say
of
for
we
clearly
can
not
confine
the
theory
to
human
life
a
dog
who
with
the
two
courses
before
him
of
doing
wrong
and
chasing
a
rabbit
or
doing
right
and
remaining
at
his
heel
chooses
one
of
them
is
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
hercules
between
the
rival
attractions
of
virtue
and
pleasure
if
hercules
acted
as
a
machine
yielding
to
the
preponderance
of
the
stronger
attraction
so
did
the
dog
but
if
hercules
exerted
and
felt
the
approval
or
blame
of
conscience
so
did
the
retriever
there
is
no
fundamental
distinction
but
merely
a
question
of
degree
between
human
conscience
and
the
shame
which
a
dog
feels
when
it
knows
that
it
has
done
wrong
and
the
pleasure
which
it
manifests
when
conscious
that
it
has
behaved
properly
shall
we
thus
conclude
as
leibnitz
and
other
great
philosophers
have
done
in
favour
of
the
mechanical
theory
but
if
we
do
how
are
we
to
account
for
the
instinctive
ineradicable
feeling
which
comes
home
to
every
one
with
a
conviction
even
stronger
than
the
evidence
of
the
senses
that
we
really
have
a
choice
between
opposite
courses
and
can
decide
on
our
own
conviction
which
is
obviously
the
foundation
of
all
conscience
and
of
all
morality
let
us
try
to
analyse
more
closely
what
will
really
means
and
under
what
conditions
it
is
manifested
the
circuit
which
connects
any
one
single
perception
with
action
through
sensory
nerve
sensory
centre
motor
centre
motor
nerve
and
muscle
is
as
purely
mechanical
as
that
of
an
electric
circuit
reflex
motions
such
as
breathing
and
even
more
complex
motions
which
by
repetition
have
become
reflex
or
instinctive
are
also
mechanical
and
involve
no
exercise
of
will
but
when
perceptions
become
complex
and
one
primary
evokes
a
number
of
secondary
other
words
when
the
cells
of
the
corresponding
portions
of
grey
matter
in
the
cortex
of
the
brain
are
set
vibrating
by
a
variety
of
complex
and
conflicting
molecular
motions
the
feeling
of
inevitably
arises
we
feel
the
conviction
that
there
is
a
something
which
we
call
soul
mind
or
in
the
last
analysis
myself
i
which
sits
as
von
moltke
might
do
in
a
cabinet
receiving
conflicting
telegraphic
messages
from
different
generals
and
deciding
then
and
there
what
order
to
flash
out
in
reply
what
can
we
say
to
this
that
it
is
like
space
and
time
one
of
the
categories
of
thought
or
primary
moulds
in
which
thought
is
cast
we
do
not
know
what
space
and
time
really
are
in
their
essence
or
why
they
are
the
necessary
conditions
of
thought
any
more
than
we
do
in
the
case
of
will
they
may
be
illusions
but
we
accept
them
and
of
necessity
accept
them
as
facts
for
all
practical
purposes
it
is
the
same
to
us
as
if
we
understood
their
essence
and
knew
them
to
be
realities
a
man
can
no
more
doubt
that
he
is
an
individual
being
with
a
will
which
in
a
great
many
cases
enables
him
to
decide
which
of
a
variety
of
impulses
shall
prevail
than
he
can
hesitate
if
he
is
furnishing
a
room
to
regulate
his
purchase
of
carpeting
and
paper
by
space
of
three
dimensions
without
regard
to
possible
speculations
as
to
quaternions
perhaps
the
principle
of
polarity
may
assist
us
in
understanding
that
both
theories
may
be
true
or
rather
that
matter
and
spirit
necessity
and
may
be
opposite
poles
of
one
fundamental
truth
which
is
beyond
our
comprehension
we
can
not
shake
off
this
principle
of
polarity
and
arrive
at
any
knowledge
or
even
conception
of
the
absolute
truth
in
regard
to
the
atoms
energies
and
natural
laws
which
make
up
the
universe
of
matter
and
of
all
the
ordinary
and
material
functions
of
life
why
should
we
expect
to
do
so
in
the
higher
manifestations
of
the
same
life
which
have
been
arrived
at
in
the
later
stages
of
one
unbroken
course
of
evolution
from
monad
to
man
this
at
any
rate
is
the
theory
which
best
satisfies
my
own
mind
and
enables
me
to
reduce
my
own
individual
chaos
into
some
sort
of
a
cosmos
i
draw
from
it
the
following
conclusions
for
all
practical
purposes
assume
that
is
right
and
that
the
moral
instincts
however
they
have
been
formed
are
imperative
laws
assume
also
that
man
is
man
and
master
of
his
fate
and
that
we
have
to
a
great
extent
the
power
of
deciding
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
but
in
doing
so
keep
the
mind
open
to
all
conclusions
of
science
and
admit
freely
that
these
assumptions
are
indissolubly
connected
with
natural
laws
and
with
material
organs
and
that
man
is
to
a
very
great
extent
dependent
on
his
environment
and
his
place
in
evolution
both
for
his
moral
code
and
for
the
force
of
will
and
conscience
which
enable
him
to
conform
to
it
learn
therefore
the
lesson
of
a
large
toleration
and
of
charity
in
thought
and
deed
towards
those
who
from
inherited
constitution
or
unfortunate
conditions
of
education
and
outward
circumstances
fall
under
the
sway
of
the
principle
of
evil
and

zoroastrianism
zoroaster
an
historical
branch
of
aryan
a
religious
at
of
of
the
and
du
to
modern
of
of
of
parsees
of
probity
enterprise
respect
for
for
and
public
and
birth
rates
zoroastrianism
is
commonly
supposed
to
derive
its
name
from
its
founder
zoroaster
a
bactrian
sage
or
prophet
who
lived
in
the
reign
of
king
gushtasp
the
first
name
has
come
down
to
us
from
antiquity
in
much
the
same
relation
to
this
form
of
religion
as
that
of
moses
to
judaism
or
of
to
buddhism
as
in
those
cases
certain
learned
commentators
have
endeavoured
to
show
that
the
alleged
founder
was
purely
mythical
and
had
no
real
historical
existence
basing
their
argument
mainly
on
the
fact
that
a
number
of
supernatural
attributes
and
embodiments
of
metaphysical
and
theological
ideas
became
attached
to
the
name
just
as
a
whole
cycle
of
solar
myths
became
associated
with
the
name
of
hercules
but
this
seems
to
be
carrying
scepticism
too
far
experience
shows
that
religions
have
generally
originated
in
the
crystallisation
of
ideas
floating
in
solution
at
certain
periods
of
the
evolution
of
societies
about
the
nucleus
of
some
powerful
personality
nearly
all
the
great
religions
of
the
world
such
as
buddhism
confucianism
christianity
and
mahometanism
clearly
had
historical
founders
and
it
would
be
hypercritical
to
deny
that
such
a
man
as
jesus
of
nazareth
really
lived
because
many
of
his
sayings
and
doings
may
be
traced
to
applications
more
or
less
erroneous
of
ancient
prophecies
or
because
his
human
nature
became
transfigured
into
the
logos
and
other
metaphysical
conceptions
of
the
alexandrian
philosophy
in
the
case
of
zoroaster
the
argument
for
his
historical
existence
seems
even
stronger
for
his
name
is
connected
with
historical
reigns
and
places
and
his
genuine
early
history
contains
nothing
supernatural
or
improbable
he
is
represented
as
simply
a
deep
thinker
and
powerful
preacher
like
luther
who
gave
new
form
and
expression
to
the
vague
religious
and
philosophical
ideas
of
his
age
and
nation
reformed
its
superstitions
and
abuses
and
converted
the
leading
minds
of
his
day
including
the
monarch
by
the
earnestness
and
eloquence
of
his
discourses
at
any
rate
for
my
purpose
i
shall
assume
his
personality
for
my
object
is
not
to
write
a
critical
essay
on
the
origin
and
development
of
the
zoroastrian
religion
but
to
show
that
in
its
fundamental
ideas
and
essential
spirit
it
approximates
wonderfully
to
those
of
the
most
advanced
modern
thought
and
gives
the
outline
of
a
creed
which
goes
further
than
any
other
to
meet
the
practical
wants
of
the
present
day
and
to
reconcile
the
conflict
between
faith
and
science
this
will
be
most
clearly
and
vividly
shown
by
assuming
the
commonly
accepted
historical
existence
of
zoroaster
to
be
true
and
by
confining
myself
to
the
broad
leading
principles
of
his
religion
without
dwelling
on
its
varying
phases
or
on
the
mythical
legends
and
ritualistic
observances
which
as
in
the
case
of
all
other
old
religions
have
crystallised
about
the
primitive
idea
and
the
primitive
founder
or
as
he
is
commonly
called
zoroaster
and
the
religion
which
goes
by
his
name
are
known
to
us
mainly
from
the
sacred
books
which
have
been
preserved
by
the
modern
parsees
the
parsees
a
small
remnant
of
the
persians
who
under
cyrus
founded
one
of
the
mightiest
empires
of
the
ancient
world
flying
from
their
native
country
to
escape
from
persecution
after
the
mahometan
conquest
formed
a
colony
in
india
and
are
now
settled
at
bombay
they
form
a
small
but
highly
intelligent
community
who
have
preserved
their
ancient
religion
and
fortunately
some
considerable
fragments
of
their
sacred
scriptures
the
oldest
of
these
are
written
in
the
gata
dialect
of
the
avesta
or
zend
language
which
is
contemporary
with
sanskrit
and
bears
much
the
same
relation
to
it
as
latin
does
to
greek
the
primitive
aryan
family
at
some
very
remote
period
became
divided
into
two
branches
and
radiated
from
their
central
asian
home
in
two
directions
the
hindoo
branch
migrated
to
the
south
into
the
punjaub
and
hindostan
the
iranian
westwards
into
bactria
and
persia
while
other
successive
waves
of
aryan
migration
in
prehistoric
times
rolled
still
further
westwards
over
europe
obliterating
all
but
a
few
traces
of
the
aboriginal
population
the
period
of
this
separation
of
the
iranian
and
hindoo
races
must
be
very
remote
for
the
is
probably
at
least
years
old
and
the
divergence
between
its
form
of
sanskrit
and
the
gata
dialect
of
the
zend
is
already
as
great
as
that
between
two
kindred
european
languages
such
as
greek
and
latin
the
divergence
of
religious
ideas
is
also
evidently
of
very
early
date
in
the
hindoo
and
all
other
races
of
the
primitive
aryan
stock
the
word
used
for
gods
and
good
spirits
is
taken
from
the
root
to
shine
thus
daeva
in
sanskrit
zeus
and
theos
in
greek
deus
in
latin
tius
in
german
diews
in
lutheranism
dia
in
irish
dew
in
kymric
all
mean
the
bright
or
shining
one
represented
by
the
vault
of
heaven
but
in
iranian
the
word
has
an
opposite
sense
and
the
correspond
to
our
the
primitive
aryan
religions
were
evidently
all
derived
from
a
contemplation
of
the
powers
and
phenomena
of
nature
the
sky
with
its
flood
of
light
and
vault
of
ethereal
blue
was
considered
to
be
the
highest
manifestation
of
a
supreme
power
while
the
sun
and
moon
the
stars
and
planets
the
winds
and
clouds
the
earth
and
waters
were
personified
either
as
symbols
of
the
deity
or
as
subordinate
gods
the
original
simple
faith
was
thus
apt
to
degenerate
into
a
system
of
polytheism
and
as
the
gods
came
to
be
represented
by
visible
forms
into
idolatry
zoroaster
appears
to
us
like
mahomet
at
a
later
age
and
among
a
ruder
people
as
a
prophet
or
reformer
who
abolished
these
abuses
and
restored
the
ancient
faith
in
a
loftier
and
more
intellectual
form
adapted
to
the
use
of
an
advanced
and
civilised
society
the
records
of
his
life
and
teaching
have
fortunately
been
preserved
in
so
authentic
a
form
that
distant
as
he
is
from
us
we
can
form
a
singularly
accurate
idea
of
who
he
was
and
what
he
taught
some
years
ago
a
sight
might
have
been
seen
in
the
ancient
city
of
famous
capital
of
bactria
the
of
like
that
witnessed
some
fourteen
centuries
later
at
our
own
canterbury
the
king
and
his
chief
nobles
and
courtiers
were
assembled
to
hear
the
discourse
of
a
preacher
who
proposed
to
teach
them
a
better
religion
gushtasp
listened
to
zoroaster
as
ethelbert
listened
to
augustine
and
in
each
case
reason
and
eloquence
carried
conviction
and
the
nation
became
converts
to
the
new
doctrine
this
conversion
was
effected
without
miracles
for
it
is
expressly
stated
in
the
celebrated
speech
of
the
prophet
preserved
in
the
chapter
of
the
yasna
that
he
relied
solely
on
persuasion
and
argument
ferdousi
the
persian
homer
thus
describes
the
first
interview
between
zoroaster
and
gushtasp
he
said
rites
and
doctrines
of
the
religion
of
excellence
for
without
religion
there
can
not
be
any
worth
in
a
king
when
the
mighty
monarch
heard
him
speak
of
the
excellent
religion
he
accepted
from
him
the
excellent
rites
and
the
doctrines
of
this
are
extremely
simple
the
leading
idea
is
that
of
monotheism
but
the
one
god
has
far
fewer
anthropomorphic
attributes
and
is
relegated
much
farther
back
into
the
vague
and
infinite
than
the
god
of
any
other
monotheistic
religion
of
which
the
more
familiar
appellation
ormuzd
is
an
abbreviation
means
the
lord
he
is
said
sometimes
to
dwell
in
the
infinite
luminous
space
and
sometimes
to
be
identical
with
it
he
is
in
fact
not
unlike
the
inscrutable
first
cause
whom
we
may
regard
with
awe
and
reverence
with
love
and
hope
but
whom
we
can
not
pretend
to
define
or
to
understand
but
the
radical
difference
between
zoroastrianism
and
other
religions
is
that
it
does
not
conceive
of
this
one
god
as
an
omnipotent
creator
who
might
make
the
universe
as
he
chose
and
therefore
was
directly
responsible
for
all
the
evil
in
it
but
as
a
being
acting
by
certain
fixed
laws
one
of
which
was
for
reasons
totally
inscrutable
to
us
that
existence
implied
polarity
and
therefore
that
there
could
be
no
good
without
corresponding
evil
haug
who
is
the
greatest
authority
on
all
questions
connected
with
the
zend
scriptures
says
arrived
at
the
grand
idea
of
the
unity
and
indivisibility
of
the
supreme
being
zoroaster
undertook
to
solve
the
great
problem
which
has
engaged
the
attention
of
so
many
wise
men
of
antiquity
and
even
in
modern
times
viz
how
are
the
imperfections
discernible
in
the
world
the
various
kind
of
evils
wickedness
and
baseness
compatible
with
the
goodness
holiness
and
justness
of
god
this
great
thinker
of
remote
antiquity
solved
this
difficult
question
philosophically
by
the
supposition
of
two
prim√¶val
causes
which
though
different
were
united
and
produced
the
world
of

point
in
the

to

according
to
the

which
is

by

to

as
in

to
exalt
the

of

by
enfeebling
the
tyranny
which
the
evil
principle
exercises
over
the
it
is
evident
that
this
simple
and
sublime
religion
is
one
to
which
by
whatever
name
we
may
call
it
the
best
modern
thought
is
fast
approximating
men
of
science
like
huxley
philosophers
like
herbert
spencer
poets
like
tennyson
might
all
subscribe
to
it
and
even
enlightened
christian
divines
like
temple
are
not
very
far
from
it
when
they
admit
the
idea
of
a
creator
behind
the
atoms
and
energies
whose
original
impress
given
in
the
form
of
laws
of
nature
was
so
perfect
as
to
require
no
secondary
interference
admit
that
christ
is
the
best
personification
of
the
spenta
mainyush
or
good
principle
in
the
inscrutable
divine
polarity
of
existence
and
a
man
may
be
at
the
same
time
a
christian
and
a
zoroastrian
the
religion
of
zoroaster
has
however
this
great
advantage
in
the
existing
conditions
of
modern
thought
that
it
is
not
dragged
down
by
such
a
dead
weight
of
traditional
dogmas
and
miracles
as
still
hangs
upon
the
skirts
of
christianity
its
dogmas
are
comprised
in
the
statement
that
there
is
one
supreme
unknown
first
cause
who
manifests
himself
in
the
universe
under
fixed
laws
which
involve
the
principle
of
polarity
this
is
hardly
so
much
a
dogma
as
a
statement
of
fact
or
of
the
ultimate
and
absolute
truth
at
which
it
is
possible
for
human
faculty
to
arrive
no
progress
of
science
or
philosophy
conflicts
with
it
but
rather
they
confirm
it
by
showing
more
and
more
clearly
with
every
discovery
that
this
is
in
very
fact
and
deed
the
literal
truth
religion
or
the
feeling
of
reverence
and
love
for
the
great
unknown
which
lies
beyond
the
sphere
of
human
sense
and
reason
shines
more
brightly
through
this
pure
medium
than
through
the
fogs
of
misty
metaphysics
and
we
can
worship
god
in
spirit
and
in
truth
without
puzzling
our
brains
as
to
the
precise
nature
of
the
logos
or
exercising
them
on
the
insoluble
problem
how
one
can
be
equal
to
three
and
at
the
same
time
three
equal
to
one
as
regards
miracles
which
are
another
millstone
about
the
neck
of
catholic
christianity
the
religion
of
zoroaster
is
entirely
free
from
them
there
are
it
is
true
a
few
miraculous
myths
about
him
in
some
of
the
later
writings
in
the
pehlvi
language
as
of
his
conception
by
his
mother
drinking
a
cup
of
the
sacred
homa
but
these
are
of
no
authority
and
form
no
part
of
the
religion
on
the
contrary
the
original
scriptures
which
profess
to
record
his
exact
words
and
precepts
disclaim
all
pretension
to
divine
nature
or
miraculous
power
and
base
the
claims
of
the
purely
on
reason
this
is
an
immense
advantage
in
the
for
life
when
every
day
is
making
it
more
impossible
for
educated
men
to
believe
that
real
miracles
ever
actually
occurred
and
when
the
evidence
on
which
they
were
accepted
is
crumbling
to
pieces
under
the
light
of
critical
enquiry
the
parsee
has
no
reason
to
tremble
for
his
faith
if
a
galileo
invents
the
telescope
or
a
newton
discovers
the
law
of
gravity
he
has
no
occasion
to
argue
for
deluge
or
for
the
order
of
creation
described
in
genesis
nay
even
he
may
remain
undisturbed
by
that
latest
and
most
fatal
discovery
that
man
has
existed
on
the
earth
for
untold
ages
and
instead
of
falling
from
a
high
estate
has
risen
continuously
by
slow
and
painful
progress
from
the
rudest
origins
how
many
orthodox
christians
can
say
the
same
or
deny
that
their
faith
in
their
sacred
books
and
venerable
traditions
has
been
rudely
shaken
the
code
of
morality
enjoined
by
the
zoroastrian
religion
is
as
pure
as
its
theory
is
perfect
haug
enumerates
the
following
sins
denounced
by
its
code
and
considered
as
such
by
the
present
parsees
murder
infanticide
poisoning
adultery
on
the
part
of
men
as
well
as
women
sorcery
sodomy
cheating
in
weight
and
measure
breach
of
promise
whether
made
to
a
zoroastrian
or
telling
lies
and
deceiving
false
covenants
slander
and
calumny
perjury
dishonest
appropriation
of
wealth
taking
bribes
keeping
back
the
wages
of
labourers
misappropriation
of
religious
property
removal
of
a
boundary
stone
turning
people
out
of
their
property
maladministration
and
defrauding
apostasy
heresy
rebellion
these
are
positive
injunctions
the
following
are
condemnable
from
a
religious
point
of
view
abandoning
the
husband
not
acknowledging
children
on
the
part
of
the
father
cruelty
towards
subjects
on
the
part
of
a
ruler
avarice
laziness
illiberality
and
egotism
envy
in
addition
there
are
a
number
of
special
precepts
adapted
to
the
peculiar
rites
of
the
zoroastrian
religion
which
aim
principally
at
the
enforcement
of
sanitary
rules
kindness
to
animals
hospitality
to
strangers
and
travellers
respect
to
superiors
and
help
to
the
poor
and
needy
it
is
evident
that
this
is
the
most
complete
and
comprehensive
code
of
morals
to
be
found
in
any
system
of
religion
it
comprises
all
that
is
best
in
the
codes
of
buddhism
judaism
and
christianity
with
a
much
more
ample
definition
of
many
vices
and
virtues
which
even
in
the
christian
religion
are
left
to
be
drawn
as
inferences
rather
than
inculcated
as
precepts
thus
laziness
cheating
selfishness
and
envy
are
distinctly
defined
as
crimes
and
their
opposites
as
virtues
and
not
merely
left
to
be
inferred
from
the
general
maxims
of
your
neighbour
as
yourself
and
unto
others
as
you
would
be
done
the
comprehensiveness
and
liberal
spirit
of
the
code
is
also
remarkable
for
we
are
repeatedly
told
that
these
rules
of
morality
apply
to
as
well
as
to
zoroastrians
the
application
of
religious
precepts
to
practical
life
is
another
distinguishing
feature
thus
kindness
to
animals
is
specially
enjoined
and
it
is
considered
a
sin
to
animals
of
the
good
creation
such
as
cattle
sheep
horses
or
dogs
by
starving
beating
or
unnecessarily
killing
them
with
true
practical
wisdom
however
the
of
is
avoided
and
this
precept
is
not
as
in
the
case
of
brahminism
and
buddhism
carried
so
far
as
to
prohibit
altogether
the
taking
of
animal
life
which
is
expressly
sanctioned
when
necessary
this
sober
practical
wisdom
or
what
matthew
arnold
calls
reasonableness
is
a
very
characteristic
feature
of
religion
and
very
remarkable
as
having
been
taught
at
so
early
a
period
in
the
history
of
civilisation
another
precept
which
might
well
have
been
made
by
an
english
board
of
health
in
the
nineteenth
century
is
not
to
pollute
water
by
throwing
impure
matter
into
it
the
only
special
parsee
rites
which
would
be
unsuited
for
modern
european
society
are
the
worship
of
the
sacred
fire
and
the
disposal
of
the
dead
it
is
true
that
the
former
is
distinctly
understood
to
be
merely
a
symbol
of
the
deity
and
used
exactly
as
water
is
in
baptism
or
as
the
ascending
flame
of
candles
and
smoke
from
swinging
incense
are
in
the
catholic
ritual
to
bring
more
vividly
before
the
minds
of
the
worshippers
the
idea
of
the
spirit
soaring
upwards
towards
heaven
still
in
modern
society
fire
is
too
well
understood
as
merely
a
particular
form
of
chemical
combination
and
is
too
familiar
as
the
strong
slave
and
household
drudge
of
man
to
acquire
a
leading
place
in
a
religious
ritual
where
it
has
not
been
hallowed
by
the
usage
of
a
long
line
of
ancestors
and
the
traditions
of
a
venerable
antiquity
all
that
can
be
said
is
that
if
religious
rites
and
ceremonies
are
to
be
maintained
in
an
age
when
science
has
become
the
prevailing
mode
of
thought
appropriate
symbolism
especially
that
of
music
must
more
and
more
take
the
place
of
appeals
to
the
intellect
on
metaphysical
questions
and
of
repetitions
of
traditional
formul√¶
which
have
lost
all
living
significance
another
parsee
rite
which
is
even
less
adapted
for
general
usage
is
that
of
disposing
of
the
dead
on
towers
of
silence
where
the
body
moulders
away
or
is
devoured
by
birds
of
prey
it
originates
in
a
poetical
motive
of
not
defiling
the
pure
elements
fire
earth
or
water
by
corruption
but
it
is
obviously
unsuited
for
the
conditions
of
civilisation
and
climate
which
prevail
in
crowded
cities
under
a
humid
sky
there
is
little
prospect
therefore
of
any
general
conversion
to
the
sect
of
zoroastrians
but
what
seems
probable
is
the
gradual
transformation
of
existing
modes
both
of
religious
and
secular
thought
into
something
which
is
in
principle
very
closely
akin
to
the
taught
by
the
bactrian
prophet
the
miraculous
theory
of
the
universe
being
virtually
dead
the
only
theory
that
can
reconcile
facts
with
feelings
and
the
ineradicable
emotions
and
aspirations
of
the
human
mind
with
the
incontrovertible
conclusions
of
science
is
that
of
a
remote
and
more
or
less
unknown
and
incomprehensible
first
cause
which
has
given
the
original
atoms
and
energies
so
perfect
an
impress
from
the
first
that
all
phenomena
are
evolved
from
them
by
fixed
laws
one
of
the
principal
of
such
laws
being
that
of
polarity
which
develops
the
complexities
and
contrasts
of
the
inorganic
and
organic
worlds
of
moralities
philosophies
religions
and
human
societies
true
religion
consists
in
a
recognition
of
this
truth
a
feeling
of
reverence
in
presence
of
the
unknown
and
above
all
a
feeling
of
love
and
admiration
for
the
good
principle
in
whatever
form
it
is
manifested
in
the
beauties
of
nature
and
of
art
in
moral
and
physical
purity
and
perfection
and
all
else
that
falls
within
the
domain
of
the
prince
of
light
in
whose
service
whether
we
conceive
of
him
as
an
abstract
principle
or
accept
some
personification
of
him
as
a
living
figure
we
enlist
as
loyal
soldiers
doing
our
best
to
fight
in
his
ranks
against
the
powers
of
evil
the
application
of
the
principle
of
polarity
is
exemplified
in
the
realm
of
art
the
glorious
greek
drama
turned
mainly
on
the
conflict
between
resistless
fate
and
heroic
and
is
typified
in
its
highest
form
by
√¶schylus
when
he
depicts
prometheus
chained
to
the
rock
hurling
defiance
at
the
tyrant
of
heaven
our
own
milton
in
like
manner
gives
us
the
spectacle
of
the
fallen
archangel
opposing
his
indomitable
will
and
fertile
resources
to
the
extremity
of
adverse
circumstance
and
to
almighty
power
the
greatest
of
modern
dramas
turns
so
entirely
on
the
opposition
between
the
human
soul
striving
after
the
infinite
and
the
spirit
who
combats
ideal
aspirations
with
a
cynical
sneer
that
it
might
well
be
called
a
zoroastrian
drama
it
is
a
picture
of
the
conflict
between
the
two
opposite
principles
of
good
and
evil
of
affirmation
and
negation
of
the
beautiful
and
the
ugly
personified
in
faust
and
mephistopheles
and
it
is
painted
on
a
background
of
the
great
mysterious
unknown
darf
ihn
nennen
who
dares
to
name
him
who
to
say
of
him
who
is
there
ever
with
a
heart
to
dare
to
utter
believe
him
so
in
poetry
tennyson
the
poet
of
modern
thought
touches
the
deepest
chords
when
he
are
god
and
nature
then
at
strife
and
paints
in
the
sharpest
contrast
on
the
background
of
the
unknown
the
conflict
between
the
faith
that
god
is
love
indeed
and
love
final
law
and
the
harsh
realities
of
nature
which
red
in
tooth
and
claw
with
ravine
shrieks
against
the
creed
or
again
in
his
later
work
ancient
sage
he
thou
canst
not
prove
the
nameless
o
my
son
for
nothing
worthy
proving
can
be
proven
nor
yet
disproven
in
like
manner
in
the
works
of
art
which
embrace
a
wider
range
and
hold
up
the
mirror
to
human
nature
as
in
plays
and
the
novels
of
walter
scott
and
other
great
authors
the
interest
arises
mainly
from
the
polarity
of
the
various
characters
we
care
little
for
the
heroes
or
vulgar
villains
but
we
recognise
a
touch
of
that
nature
which
makes
all
the
world
akin
in
a
macbeth
drawn
by
metaphysical
suggestion
to
wade
through
a
sea
of
blood
in
noble
nature
caught
like
a
lion
in
the
toils
by
the
net
of
circumstances
woven
by
a
wily
hunter
in
falstaff
a
rogue
a
liar
and
a
glutton
yet
made
almost
likeable
by
his
ready
wit
imperturbable
and
fertile
resources
shakespeare
is
in
fact
the
greatest
of
artists
because
he
is
the
most
multipolar
he
has
poles
of
sympathy
in
him
which
as
the
poles
of
carbon
attract
so
many
elements
and
form
so
many
combinations
enable
him
to
take
into
his
own
nature
assimilate
and
reproduce
every
varied
shade
of
character
from
a
miranda
to
a
caliban
from
an
imogen
to
a
lady
macbeth
from
a
falstaff
to
an
othello
sir
walter
scott
and
all
our
great
novelists
have
the
same
faculty
though
in
a
less
degree
and
are
great
in
exact
proportion
as
they
have
many
poles
in
their
nature
and
as
those
are
poles
of
powerful
polarity
the
characters
and
incidents
which
affect
us
strongly
and
dwell
in
the
memory
are
those
in
which
the
clash
and
conflict
of
opposites
are
most
vividly
represented
we
feel
infinite
pity
for
a
maggie
tulliver
dashing
her
young
life
like
a
prisoned
wild
bird
against
the
bars
of
trivial
and
prosaic
environment
which
hem
her
in
or
for
a
colonel
newcome
opposing
the
patience
of
a
gentle
nature
to
the
buffets
of
such
a
fate
as
meets
us
in
the
everyday
world
of
modern
life
the
failure
of
his
bank
and
the
naggings
of
the
old
campaigner
on
a
higher
level
of
art
we
sympathise
with
a
lancelot
and
a
guinevere
because
they
are
types
of
what
we
may
meet
in
many
a
london
noble
natures
drawn
by
some
fatal
fairy
fascination
into
ignoble
acts
but
still
retaining
something
of
their
original
nobility
and
while
their
honour
rooted
in
dishonour
stands
appearing
to
ordinary
mortals
little
less
than
or
even
if
we
descend
to
the
lowest
level
of
the
penny
dreadful
or
suburban
drama
we
find
that
the
polarity
between
vice
and
virtue
however
coarsely
delineated
is
that
which
mostly
fascinates
the
uncultured
mind
the
affinity
between
zoroastrianism
and
art
is
easily
explained
when
we
consider
that
in
one
respect
it
has
a
manifest
advantage
over
most
christian
forms
of
religion
christianity
in
its
early
origins
received
a
taint
of
oriental
asceticism
which
it
never
shook
off
and
which
in
the
declining
centuries
of
the
roman
empire
and
in
the
barbarism
and
superstition
of
the
middle
ages
developed
into
what
may
be
almost
called
a
of
the
ugly
and
repulsive
the
antithesis
between
the
flesh
and
the
spirit
was
carried
to
such
an
extreme
and
false
extent
that
everything
that
was
pleasant
and
beautiful
came
to
be
regarded
as
sinful
and
the
odour
of
sanctity
was
an
odour
which
the
would
do
well
to
keep
on
the
windward
side
of
this
leaven
of
asceticism
is
the
rock
upon
which
puritanism
monasticism
and
many
of
the
highest
forms
of
christian
life
have
invariably
split
it
is
contrary
to
human
nature
and
directly
opposed
to
the
spirit
of
the
life
and
doctrines
of
the
founder
of
the
religion
jesus
who
was
jew
living
among
jews
and
speaking
to
jews
adopted
the
true
jewish
point
of
view
of
making
religion
amiable
and
attractive
and
denouncing
as
all
the
best
jewish
doctors
of
the
talmud
did
the
pharisaical
strictness
which
insisted
on
ritualistic
observances
and
arbitrary
restrictions
in
no
passages
of
his
life
does
the
of
his
character
appear
more
conspicuous
than
where
we
find
him
strolling
through
the
fields
with
his
disciples
and
plucking
ears
of
corn
on
the
sabbath
and
replying
to
the
formalists
who
were
scandalised
sabbath
was
made
for
man
not
man
for
the
the
ascetic
bias
subsequently
introduced
may
have
been
a
necessary
element
in
counteracting
the
corruption
of
rome
but
the
pendulum
in
its
reaction
swung
much
too
far
and
when
organised
in
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
and
monastic
institutions
asceticism
became
the
source
of
great
evils
even
at
a
late
period
we
can
see
in
the
reaction
of
the
reign
of
charles
ii
how
antagonistic
the
puritanical
creed
even
of
men
like
cromwell
and
milton
proved
to
the
healthy
natural
instinct
of
the
great
mass
of
the
english
nation
and
at
the
present
day
it
remains
one
of
the
main
causes
of
the
indifference
or
hostility
to
religion
which
is
so
widely
spreading
among
the
mass
of
the
population
children
are
brought
up
to
consider
sunday
as
a
day
of
penance
and
as
a
disagreeable
necessity
while
men
especially
those
of
the
working
classes
resent
being
told
that
a
walk
in
the
country
a
or
a
visit
to
a
library
or
museum
on
their
only
holiday
is
sinful
in
view
of
the
approximation
between
the
zoroastrian
religion
and
the
forms
of
modern
thought
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
the
former
works
among
its
adherents
in
actual
practice
for
after
all
the
practical
side
of
a
religion
is
more
important
than
its
speculative
or
philosophical
theories
thus
for
instance
the
quakers
have
a
faith
which
is
about
the
most
reasonable
of
any
of
the
numerous
sects
of
christianity
and
nearest
to
the
spirit
of
its
founder
and
yet
quakerism
remains
a
narrow
sect
which
is
far
from
being
victorious
in
the
for
life
mahometanism
again
while
dying
out
among
civilised
nations
shows
itself
superior
to
christianity
in
the
work
of
raising
the
barbarous
negroes
of
africa
to
a
higher
level
and
mormonism
based
on
the
most
obvious
imposture
and
absurdity
is
the
only
new
religion
which
in
recent
times
has
taken
root
and
to
a
certain
extent
flourished
tried
by
this
test
zoroastrianism
has
made
good
its
claim
to
be
called
the
its
followers
the
limited
community
of
parsees
in
india
are
honourably
distinguished
for
probity
intelligence
enterprise
public
spirit
benevolence
tolerance
and
other
good
qualities
by
virtue
of
these
qualities
they
have
raised
themselves
to
a
prominent
position
in
our
indian
empire
and
take
a
leading
part
in
its
commerce
and
industrial
enterprise
the
chief
shipbuilder
at
bombay
the
first
great
native
railway
contractor
the
founder
of
cotton
factories
are
all
parsees
and
they
are
found
as
merchants
traders
and
shopkeepers
in
all
the
chief
towns
of
british
india
and
distant
places
such
as
aden
and
zanzibar
their
commercial
probity
is
proverbial
and
as
in
england
they
have
few
written
agreements
the
word
of
a
parsee
like
that
of
an
englishman
being
considered
as
good
as
his
bond
their
high
character
and
practical
aptitude
for
business
are
attested
by
the
fact
that
the
first
mayor
or
chairman
of
the
corporation
of
bombay
was
a
parsee
who
was
elected
by
the
unanimous
vote
both
of
europeans
and
natives
the
position
of
women
affords
perhaps
the
best
test
of
the
real
civilisation
and
intrinsic
worth
of
any
community
where
men
consider
women
as
inferior
creatures
it
is
a
sure
proof
that
they
themselves
are
so
they
are
totally
wanting
in
that
delicacy
and
refinement
of
nature
which
distinguishes
the
true
gentleman
from
the
snob
or
the
savage
and
are
coarse
vulgar
brutes
however
disguised
under
a
veneer
of
outward
polish
on
the
other
hand
respect
for
women
implies
nobility
of
nature
capability
of
rising
to
high
ideals
above
the
sordid
level
of
animal
appetite
and
the
selfish
supremacy
of
brute
force
the
parsees
in
this
respect
stand
high
far
higher
than
any
other
oriental
people
and
on
a
level
with
the
best
european
civilisation
the
equality
of
the
sexes
is
distinctly
laid
down
in
the
zoroastrian
scriptures
women
are
always
mentioned
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
religious
community
they
have
the
same
religious
rites
as
the
men
the
spirits
of
deceased
women
are
invoked
as
well
as
those
of
men
long
contact
with
the
other
races
of
india
and
the
necessity
for
some
outward
conformity
to
the
practices
of
hindoo
and
mahometan
rulers
did
something
to
impair
the
position
of
females
as
regards
public
appearances
though
the
parsee
wife
and
mother
always
remained
a
principal
figure
in
the
parsee
household
and
latterly
under
the
security
of
english
rule
parsee
ladies
may
be
seen
everywhere
in
public
enjoying
just
as
much
liberty
as
the
ladies
of
europe
or
america
nor
are
they
at
all
behind
their
western
sisters
in
education
accomplishments
and
it
may
be
added
in
daintiness
of
fashionable
attire
in
fact
an
eager
desire
for
education
has
become
a
prominent
feature
among
all
classes
of
the
parsee
community
and
they
are
quite
on
a
par
with
the
scotch
german
and
other
european
races
in
their
efforts
to
establish
schools
and
in
the
numbers
who
attend
and
especially
of
those
who
obtain
distinguished
places
in
the
higher
schools
and
colleges
such
as
the
elphinstone
institute
and
the
bombay
university
female
education
is
also
actively
promoted
and
no
prejudices
stand
in
the
way
of
attendance
at
the
numerous
schools
which
have
been
established
or
even
of
studying
in
medical
colleges
where
parsee
women
attend
lectures
on
all
branches
of
medical
science
along
with
male
students
those
who
know
the
position
of
inferiority
and
seclusion
in
which
women
are
kept
among
all
other
oriental
nations
can
best
appreciate
the
largeness
and
liberality
of
spirit
of
a
religion
which
in
spite
of
all
surrounding
influences
has
rendered
such
a
thing
possible
in
such
a
country
as
india
another
prominent
trait
of
the
parsee
character
is
that
of
philanthropy
and
public
spirit
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
and
means
they
raise
more
money
for
charitable
objects
than
any
other
religious
sect
and
they
raise
it
in
a
way
which
does
the
greatest
credit
to
their
tolerance
and
liberality
for
instance
the
parsees
were
the
principal
subscribers
to
a
fund
raised
in
bombay
in
aid
of
the
corporation
and
quite
recently
a
parsee
gentleman
gave
towards
the
establishment
of
a
female
hospital
under
the
care
of
lady
doctors
although
the
benefit
of
such
an
institution
would
be
confined
principally
to
mahometan
and
hindoo
women
parsee
women
having
no
prejudice
against
employing
male
doctors
the
public
spirit
shown
by
acts
like
this
is
the
trait
by
which
the
parsee
community
is
most
honourably
distinguished
and
in
respect
of
which
it
must
be
candidly
confessed
it
far
surpasses
not
only
other
oriental
races
but
most
european
nations
including
our
own
whatever
the
reason
may
be
the
fact
is
certain
that
in
england
while
a
great
deal
of
money
is
spent
in
charity
lamentably
little
is
spent
from
the
enormous
surplus
wealth
of
the
country
on
what
may
be
called
public
objects
there
is
neither
religious
influence
nor
social
opinion
brought
to
bear
on
the
numerous
class
who
have
incomes
far
beyond
any
possible
want
to
teach
them
that
it
should
be
both
a
pleasure
and
a
pride
to
associate
their
names
with
some
act
of
noble
liberality
a
better
spirit
we
may
hope
is
springing
up
and
there
have
been
occasional
instances
of
large
sums
applied
to
public
purposes
such
as
parks
and
colleges
by
private
individuals
principally
of
the
trading
and
manufacturing
classes
such
as
the
salts
crossleys
baxters
and
holloways
but
on
the
whole
the
amount
contributed
is
miserably
small
it
is
probably
part
of
the
price
we
pay
for
aristocratic
institutions
that
those
who
inherit
or
accumulate
great
fortunes
consider
it
their
primary
object
to
perpetuate
or
to
found
great
families
be
this
as
it
may
a
totally
different
spirit
prevails
among
the
parsees
of
bombay
where
it
has
been
truly
stated
that
hardly
a
year
passes
without
some
wealthy
parsee
coming
forward
to
perform
a
work
of
public
generosity
the
instance
of
sir
jamsedjee
jijibhoy
who
attained
a
european
reputation
for
his
noble
benevolence
is
only
one
conspicuous
instance
out
of
a
thousand
of
this
which
has
become
almost
an
instinctive
element
in
parsee
society
how
far
the
large
and
liberal
religion
may
be
the
cause
of
the
large
and
liberal
practice
it
is
impossible
to
say
other
influences
have
doubtless
been
at
work
the
parsees
are
a
commercial
people
and
commerce
is
always
more
liberal
with
its
money
than
land
they
are
the
descendants
of
a
persecuted
race
and
as
a
rule
it
is
better
to
be
persecuted
than
to
persecute
still
after
making
all
allowances
it
remains
that
the
tree
can
not
be
bad
which
bears
such
fruits
the
religion
must
be
a
good
one
which
produces
good
men
and
women
and
good
deeds
statistical
facts
testify
quite
as
strongly
to
the
high
standard
of
the
parsee
race
and
the
practical
results
which
follow
from
the
observance
of
the
zoroastrian
ritual
a
small
and
a
large
proportion
of
children
prove
the
vigorous
vitality
of
a
race
the
parsees
have
the
lowest
of
any
of
the
many
races
who
inhabit
bombay

average

the
two
years
and
per

hindoos

mussulmans
for
europeans

parsees

percentage
of
children
under
two
years
old
to
women
between
fifteen
and
was
for
parsees
as
against
hindoos
and
mussulmans
showing
incontestably
greater
vitality
and
greater
care
for
human
life
of
male
and
female
mendicants
in
the
city
of
bombay
only
five
male
and
one
female
were
parsees
these
figures
speak
for
themselves
it
is
evident
that
a
religion
in
which
such
results
are
possible
can
not
be
unfavourable
to
the
development
of
the
sana
in
corpore
sano
and
that
although
we
may
not
turn
zoroastrians
we
may
envy
some
of
the
results
of
a
creed
which
inculcates
worship
of
the
good
the
pure
and
the
beautiful
in
the
concerns
of
daily
life

well
as

iii
a
shrewd
an
interesting
and
instructive
record
of
experiences
during
a
voyage
round
the
world
gives
the
following
description
of
the
worship
of
the
modern
parsees
as
actually
witnessed
by
him
at
bombay
evening
we
were
surprised
to
see
as
we
strolled
along
the
beach
more
parsees
than
ever
before
and
more
parsee
ladies
richly
dressed
all
wending
their
way
towards
the
sea
it
was
the
first
of
the
new
moon
a
period
sacred
to
these
worshippers
of
the
elements
and
here
on
the
shore
of
the
ocean
as
the
sun
was
sinking
in
the
sea
and
the
slender
silver
thread
of
the
crescent
moon
was
faintly
shining
on
the
horizon
they
congregated
to
perform
their
religious
rites
was
there
in
its
grandest
form
the
setting
sun
and
water
in
the
vast
expanse
of
the
indian
ocean
outstretched
before
them
the
earth
was
under
their
feet
and
wafted
across
the
sea
the
air
came
laden
with
the
perfumes
of
the
surely
no
time
or
place
could
be
more
fitly
chosen
than
this
for
lifting
up
the
soul
to
the
realms
beyond
sense
i
could
not
but
participate
with
these
worshippers
in
what
was
so
grandly
beautiful
there
was
no
music
save
the
solemn
moan
of
the
waves
as
they
broke
into
foam
on
the
beach
but
where
shall
we
find
so
mighty
an
organ
or
so
grand
an
anthem
inexpressibly
sublime
the
scene
appeared
to
me
and
how
insignificant
and
unworthy
of
the
unknown
seemed
even
our
cathedrals
with
human
hands
when
compared
with
this
looking
up
through
nature
unto
god
i
stood
and
drank
in
the
serene
happiness
which
seemed
to
fill
the
air
i
have
seen
many
modes
and
forms
of
disgusting
others
saddening
a
few
elevating
when
the
organ
pealed
forth
its
tones
but
all
poor
in
comparison
with
this
nor
do
i
ever
expect
in
all
my
life
to
witness
a
religious
ceremony
which
will
so
powerfully
affect
me
as
that
of
the
parsees
on
the
beach
at
i
say
amen
with
all
my
heart
to
carnegie
here
is
an
ideal
religious
ceremony
combining
all
that
is
most
true
most
touching
and
most
sublime
in
the
attitude
of
man
towards
the
great
unknown
compare
it
with
the
routine
of
an
ordinary
english
sunday
and
how
poor
and
prosaic
does
the
latter
appear
there
is
nothing
which
seems
to
me
to
have
fallen
more
completely
out
of
harmony
with
its
existing
environment
than
our
traditional
form
of
church
service
the
sermon
has
been
killed
by
the
press
and
has
become
an
anachronism
there
was
a
time
when
sermons
like
those
of
latimer
and
john
knox
were
living
realities
they
dealt
with
all
the
burning
political
and
personal
questions
of
the
day
and
to
a
great
extent
did
the
work
now
done
by
platform
speeches
and
leading
articles
if
there
are
national
dangers
to
be
denounced
national
shortcomings
to
be
pointed
out
iniquity
in
high
places
to
be
rebuked
we
look
to
our
daily
newspaper
and
not
to
our
weekly
sermon
the
sermon
has
in
a
great
majority
of
cases
become
a
sort
of
schoolboy
theme
in
which
traditional
assumptions
and
conventional
phrases
are
ground
out
with
as
little
soul
or
idea
behind
them
as
in
the
thibetan
in
the
course
of
a
long
life
i
have
gained
innumerable
ideas
and
experienced
innumerable
influences
from
contact
with
the
world
with
and
with
books
but
although
i
have
heard
a
good
many
sermons
i
can
not
honestly
say
that
i
ever
got
an
idea
or
an
influence
from
one
of
them
which
made
me
wiser
or
better
or
different
in
any
respect
from
what
i
should
have
been
if
i
had
slept
through
them
and
this
from
no
fault
of
the
preachers
i
have
heard
many
who
gave
me
the
impression
that
they
were
good
men
and
a
few
who
impressed
me
as
being
able
and
do
i
know
that
under
the
conditions
in
which
they
are
placed
i
could
have
done
any
better
myself
but
they
were
dancing
in
fetters
and
so
tied
down
by
conventionalities
that
it
was
simply
impossible
for
them
to
depart
from
the
paths
of
a
decorous
routine
the
fact
is
that
the
whole
point
of
view
of
our
religious
services
especially
in
protestant
countries
has
become
a
mistaken
one
it
is
far
too
much
an
appeal
to
the
intellect
and
to
abstract
dogmas
and
too
little
one
to
the
realities
of
actual
life
and
to
the
vague
emotions
and
aspirations
which
constitute
the
proper
field
of
religion
in
the
great
reaction
of
the
reformation
it
was
perhaps
inevitable
that
an
appeal
should
be
made
to
reason
against
the
abuses
of
an
infallible
church
and
as
long
as
the
literal
inspiration
of
the
bible
and
other
theological
premises
were
held
to
be
undoubted
axioms
by
the
whole
christian
world
there
might
be
a
certain
interest
in
hearing
them
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
becoming
language
and
in
listening
to
sermons
which
explained
shortly
conclusions
which
might
be
drawn
from
these
admitted
axioms
but
this
is
no
longer
the
case
it
is
impossible
to
touch
the
merest
fringe
of
the
questions
now
raised
by
the
intellectual
side
of
religion
in
discourses
of
half
an
length
even
if
the
preacher
were
perfectly
free
and
not
hampered
by
the
fear
of
scandalising
simple
pious
souls
by
plain
language
spoken
words
have
to
a
great
extent
ceased
to
be
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
appealing
either
to
religious
reason
or
to
religious
for
the
former
music
for
the
latter
are
infinitely
more
effective
music
especially
seems
made
to
be
the
language
of
religion
not
only
its
beauty
and
harmony
but
its
vagueness
and
its
power
of
exciting
the
imagination
and
stirring
the
feelings
without
anything
definite
which
has
to
be
proved
and
can
be
contradicted
fit
it
to
be
the
interpreter
of
those
emotions
and
aspirations
which
fill
the
human
soul
in
presence
of
the
universe
and
of
the
great
unknown
demonstrate
with
thomas
aquinas
or
duns
scotus
how
many
angels
can
stand
on
the
point
of
a
needle
and
i
remain
unaffected
but
let
me
hear
animam
or
dei
and
i
say
the
angels
in
this
respect
the
roman
catholic
church
has
retained
a
great
advantage
over
reformed
churches
whatever
we
may
think
of
its
tenets
and
principles
its
forms
of
worship
are
more
impressive
and
more
attractive
the
mass
apart
from
all
dogma
and
miracle
is
a
mysterious
and
beautiful
religious
drama
in
which
appropriate
symbolism
vocal
and
instrumental
music
all
the
highest
efforts
of
human
art
are
united
to
produce
feelings
of
joy
and
of
devoutness
the
vestment
of
the
priest
his
gestures
and
genuflexions
the
latin
words
chanted
in
stately
recitative
the
flame
of
the
candles
pointing
heavenwards
the
burning
incense
slowly
soaring
upwards
the
music
of
great
masters
not
like
our
dreary
and
monotonous
psalmody
but
in
fullest
harmony
and
richest
combine
to
attune
the
mind
to
that
state
of
feeling
which
is
the
soul
of
religion
in
this
respect
however
what
i
have
called
the
zoroastrian
theory
of
religion
affords
great
advantages
it
connects
religion
directly
with
all
that
is
good
and
beautiful
not
only
in
the
higher
realms
of
speculation
and
of
emotion
but
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
daily
life
to
feel
the
truth
of
what
is
true
the
beauty
of
what
is
beautiful
is
of
itself
a
silent
prayer
or
act
of
worship
to
the
spirit
of
light
to
make
an
honest
earnest
effort
to
attain
this
feeling
is
an
offering
or
act
of
homage
cleanliness
of
mind
and
body
order
and
propriety
in
conduct
civility
in
intercourse
and
all
the
homely
virtues
of
everyday
life
thus
acquire
a
higher
significance
and
any
wilful
and
persistent
disregard
of
them
becomes
an
act
of
mutiny
against
the
power
whom
we
have
elected
to
serve
such
moral
perversion
becomes
impossible
as
that
which
in
the
middle
ages
associated
filth
with
holiness
and
adduced
as
a
title
to
canonisation
that
the
saint
had
worn
the
same
woollen
shirt
until
it
fell
to
pieces
under
the
attacks
of
vermin
we
laugh
at
this
in
more
enlightened
days
but
we
often
imitate
it
by
setting
up
false
religious
standards
and
thinking
we
can
make
men
better
by
penning
them
up
on
sundays
in
the
foul
air
and
corrupting
influences
of
densely
peopled
cities
the
identification
of
moral
and
physical
evil
which
is
one
of
the
most
essential
and
peculiar
tenets
of
the
zoroastrian
creed
is
fast
becoming
a
leading
idea
in
modern
civilisation
our
most
earnest
philanthropists
and
zealous
workers
in
the
fields
of
sin
and
misery
in
crowded
cities
are
coming
more
and
more
every
day
to
the
conviction
that
an
improvement
in
the
physical
conditions
of
life
is
the
first
indispensable
condition
of
moral
and
religious
progress
more
air
more
light
better
lodging
better
food
more
innocent
and
healthy
recreation
are
what
are
wanted
to
make
any
real
impression
on
the
masses
who
have
either
been
born
and
bred
in
an
evil
environment
or
have
fallen
out
of
the
ranks
and
are
the
waifs
and
stragglers
left
behind
in
the
rapid
progress
and
intense
competition
of
modern
society
hence
we
see
that
the
devoted
individuals
and
charitable
institutions
who
take
the
lead
in
works
of
practical
benevolence
direct
their
attention
more
and
more
to
the
rescue
of
children
from
bad
surroundings
to
sending
them
to
new
and
happier
homes
in
the
colonies
to
country
retreats
for
the
sickly
and
excursions
for
the
healthy
and
to
providing
clubs
and
as
substitutes
for
the
and
the
latest
development
of
this
idea
that
of
the
in
the
east
end
of
london

a
noble
offering
to
the
of

by
whatever
name
we
choose
to

opposition

zoroastrian

the
form
of
a
recognition
of
all
that
is
pure
sublime
and
beautiful
in
the
surrounding
universe
he
can
never
want
opportunities
of
paying
homage
to
the
good
spirit
and
of
looking
into
the
abysses
of
the
unknown
with
reverence
and
wonder
the
light
of
setting
suns
the
dome
of
loving
blue
the
clouds
in
the
might
of
the
tempest
or
resting
still
as
brooding
doves
the
mountains
the
waste
and
solitary
places
where
we
taste
the
pleasure
of
believing
what
we

is
boundless
as
we
wish
our
souls
to
be
the
ocean
lashed
by
storm

where

him

of

and
french
land

and
and
trade
and
and
and
and
and
duties
of
remarks
a
fable
tells
how
in
the
olden
time
two
knights
were
riding
in
opposite
directions
along
a
green
road
overarched
by
the
trees
of
an
ancient
forest
it
was
a
bright
morning
in
early
summer
with
the
green
leaves
freshly
bursting
in
contrasted
foliage
the
sun
had
just
risen
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
clouds
of
golden
and
crimson
glory
dewdrops
were
glittering
like
diamonds
on
every
twig
and
blade
of
grass
and
the
joyous
birds
carolling
their
loudest
song
to
greet
the
opening
day
everything
was
fresh
and
cheerful
as
of
a
earth
and
so
were
the
spirits
of
the
two
youthful
knights
who
were
pricking
forth
in
search
of
adventures
he
whose
face
was
turned
towards
the
west
where
the
rising
sun
had
last
set
wore
a
primrose
scarf
over
his
cuirass
and
had
on
his
shield
a
quaint
device
which
on
closer
inspection
might
be
seen
to
be
a
tombstone
with
the
inscription
was
well
would
be
better
and
here
i
he
rode
along
musing
on
the
heroic
legends
of
the
past
and
wishing
that
he
had
been
a
knight
of
round
table
to
ride
out
with
the
blameless
king
against
invading
heathen
the
second
knight
whose
face
was
turned
towards
the
rising
sun
bore
an
azure
shield
with
a
different
device
on
it
was
depicted
the
good
sir
james
douglass
charging
the
serried
paynim
army
and
as
he
charged
flinging
before
him
into
the
hostile
ranks
the
casket
containing
the
heart
of
robert
bruce
and
shouting
for
go
thou
aye
forward
as
was
thy
wont
as
he
rode
his
fancy
wrought
the
fairy
web
of
a
in
which
he
saw
himself
delivering
the
fair
princess
liberty
from
the
fiery
dragon
prejudice
and
the
stolid
giant
obstruction
the
knights
met
just
where
an
ancient
oak
of
mighty
bulk
stretched
overhead
a
huge
branch
across
the
path
as
some
aged
athlete
might
stretch
out
an
arm
rigid
with
gnarled
and
knotted
muscles
to
show
younger
generations
how
olympian
laurels
were
won
when
pollux
or
hercules
plied
the
cestus
from
this
branch
a
shield
hung
suspended
morrow
fair
knight
said
he
of
the
primrose
scarf
tell
me
if
thou
knowest
what
means
this
golden
shield
suspended
marvel
at
it
myself
good
sir
knight
responded
the
other
you
mistake
in
calling
the
shield
golden
it
is
of
eyes
must
be
of
the
dullest
said
the
first
knight
you
mistake
gold
for
so
dull
as
yours
retorted
the
other
you
mistake
silver
for
the
argument
waxed
hot
and
as
usual
in
such
cases
as
tempers
grew
weak
adjectives
grew
strong
soon
like
the
old
homeric
heroes
when
greek
met
trojan
far
on
the
ringing
plains
of
windy
troy
winged
words
of
fire
and
fury
darted
from
each
mouth
and
epithets
were
exchanged
of
which
old
and
vulgar
were
among
the
least
unparliamentary
at
length
the
fatal
words
escaped
simultaneously
from
both
and
on
the
instant
spears
were
couched
steeds
spurred
and
red
with
rage
they
encountered
each
other
in
full
career
such
was
the
momentum
that
both
men
and
horses
rolled
over
even
as
the
templar
went
down
before
the
spear
of
ivanhoe
within
the
lists
of
but
like
the
redoubted
knight
brian
de
each
sprang
to
his
feet
and
drew
his
sword
eager
to
redeem
the
fortune
of
war
in
deadly
combat
like
two
surly
boars
with
bristling
backs
and
foaming
tusks
quarrelling
for
the
right
of
way
in
indian
jungle
or
tawny
lions
in
numidian
desert
tearing
one
another
to
pieces
for
the
smiles
of
a
leonine
helen
the
heroes
clashed
together
cutting
slashing
parrying
foyning
and
traversing
until
at
length
bleeding
and
breathless
they
paused
for
a
moment
leaning
on
their
swords
to
recover
second
wind
just
then
an
aged
hermit
appeared
on
the
scene
drawn
thither
by
the
sound
of
the
combat
my
sons
he
said
tell
me
what
is
the
cause
of
this
furious
false
villain
protests
said
the
one
the
shield
which
hangs
there
is
of
that
lying
varlet
persists
that
it
is
of
silver
said
the
other
the
hermit
smiled
and
said
your
hands
good
sirs
for
a
single
moment
and
use
your
remaining
strength
to
exchange
places
and
look
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
they
obeyed
his
words
and
found
to
their
confusion
that
they
had
been
fighting
in
a
quarrel
in
which
each
was
right
and
each
wrong
they
said
are
fools
grant
us
thy
pardon
for
our
folly
and
absolution
for
our
said
the
hermit
soon
granted
for
faults
which
arise
from
the
innate
tendency
of
poor
human
nature
wiser
and
older
men
than
you
are
prone
to
see
only
their
own
side
of
a
question
come
then
with
me
to
my
humble
hermitage
there
will
i
dress
your
wounds
and
offer
you
my
frugal
fare
happy
if
from
this
lesson
you
may
learn
for
the
rest
of
your
lives
before
indulging
in
vehement
assertions
and
proceeding
to
violent
extremities
to
at
the
other
side
of
the
the
application
of
this
fable
to
the
polarity
of
politics
will
be
obvious
to
every
intelligent
reader
as
the
earth
is
kept
in
its
orbit
by
the
due
balance
of
centripetal
and
centrifugal
forces
so
is
every
civilised
society
held
together
by
the
opposite
influences
of
conservative
and
progressive
tendencies
the
conservative
tendency
may
be
likened
to
the
centripetal
force
which
binds
the
mass
together
while
the
progressive
one
resembles
that
centrifugal
force
which
prevents
it
from
being
concentrated
in
a
rigid
and
inert
central
body
without
life
or
motion
as
herbert
spencer
truly
says
antagonistic
social
tendencies
there
always
results
not
a
medium
state
but
a
rhythm
between
opposite
states
now
the
one
greatly
preponderates
and
presently
by
reaction
there
comes
a
preponderance
of
the
so
it
is
with
the
antagonism
of
conservative
and
liberal
tendencies
in
the
societies
of
the
ancient
world
and
to
the
present
day
in
the
east
the
conservative
tendency
unduly
preponderates
and
they
crystallise
into
inert
masses
in
the
form
of
despotisms
and
of
sacerdotal
or
administrative
hierarchies
at
times
the
forces
which
make
for
change
accumulate
and
as
in
the
french
revolution
explode
with
destructive
violence
shattering
the
old
and
bringing
in
new
eras
but
unless
the
balance
between
liberty
and
order
is
tolerably
preserved
in
the
individual
citizens
whose
aggregate
forms
the
society
after
a
period
more
or
less
prolonged
of
violent
oscillations
they
crystallise
anew
into
fresh
forms
in
which
another
military
dynasty
or
it
may
be
administrative
centralisation
under
the
name
of
a
republic
again
asserts
the
preponderance
of
the
centripetal
force
the
happiest
nations
are
those
in
which
the
individual
character
of
individual
citizens
supplies
the
requisite
balance
an
ideal
society
is
one
in
which
every
citizen
is
at
the
same
time
liberal
and
conservative
and
yet
with
a
strong
instinct
for
liberty
of
thought
and
action
for
progress
and
for
individual
independence
it
is
among
the
teutonic
races
especially
when
they
are
placed
in
favourable
conditions
as
in
new
countries
or
in
old
countries
where
for
ages
freedom
has
widened
slowly
down
from
precedent
to
precedent
that
this
happy
ideal
is
most
nearly
realised
hence
it
is
that
these
races
are
more
and
more
coming
to
the
front
and
surviving
in
the
struggle
for
existence
the
contrast
of
english
and
french
colonisation
affords
a
striking
instance
of
this
difference
of
races
a
century
and
a
half
ago
france
stood
as
well
as
england
in
the
race
for
colonial
supremacy
she
had
the
start
of
us
in
canada
and
her
pioneers
had
explored
the
great
lakes
the
mississippi
and
a
large
part
of
the
continent
of
north
america
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
there
are
sixty
millions
of
an
population
in
that
continent
while
french
is
scarcely
spoken
beyond
the
single
province
of
quebec
political
events
had
doubtless
something
to
do
with
this
result
but
it
has
been
mainly
owing
to
the
innate
qualities
of
the
two
races
for
even
the
genius
of
chatham
might
have
failed
to
establish
our
supremacy
if
it
had
not
been
backed
by
the
superior
intelligence
energy
and
staying
power
of
the
english
colonists
the
ultimate
cause
of
the
triumph
of
the
english
over
the
french
element
in
america
and
india
is
doubtless
to
be
found
in
the
stronger
individualism
of
the
former
the
character
of
the
french
is
eminently
social
they
like
to
live
in
societies
and
shrink
from
encountering
the
hardships
and
still
more
the
isolation
of
the
life
of
early
settlers
they
like
to
be
administered
and
shrink
from
the
responsibility
of
hewing
out
each
for
themselves
their
own
path
in
the
relations
of
civil
life
or
in
the
depths
of
prim√¶val
forests
it
is
so
to
the
present
day
and
they
fail
conspicuously
in
creating
a
large
french
population
even
at
their
own
doors
in
algeria
while
in
their
more
distant
colonies
they
conquer
and
annex
but
to
see
their
commerce
fall
into
the
hands
of
english
germans
and
chinese
as
in
cochin
china
or
to
stagnate
as
in
new
caledonia
as
a
witty
french
writer
puts
it
the
trade
of
a
remote
french
colony
may
be
summed
up
absinthe
and
cigars
exports
stamped
paper
and
individualism
in
this
case
has
been
fairly
pitted
against
socialism
and
has
beaten
it
out
of
the
field
by
the
verdict
of
fact
which
is
more
conclusive
than
any
amount
of
abstract
argument
to
return
however
to
the
field
of
politics
where
the
essential
quality
of
being
is
wanting
in
individuals
it
is
hopeless
to
look
for
real
liberty
the
centripetal
force
in
societies
as
in
planets
must
be
supplied
somehow
or
they
would
fly
into
dissolution
and
if
not
by
the
integration
of
the
tendencies
of
the
individual
units
then
by
external
restrictions
socialists
may
be
allowed
to
make
inflammatory
harangues
in
a
atmosphere
but
hardly
to
let
off
their
fireworks
in
a
in
order
however
that
a
nation
shall
be
it
is
essential
that
the
great
majority
should
feel
that
on
the
whole
the
law
is
their
friend
it
is
not
in
human
nature
to
love
that
which
injures
or
to
respect
that
which
is
felt
to
be
unjust
the
volcanic
explosion
of
the
french
revolution
was
due
to
the
feeling
of
the
french
nation
with
the
exception
of
a
few
courtiers
nobles
and
priests
that
the
existing
order
of
things
was
their
enemy
and
law
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
their
oppressors
even
among
races
we
find
in
the
unfortunate
instance
of
ireland
that
under
specially
unfavourable
circumstances
the
same
effects
may
be
produced
by
the
same
causes
what
has
english
law
practically
meant
for
centuries
to
an
average
peasant
of
kerry
or
connemara
it
has
meant
an
irresistible
malevolent
power
which
comes
down
on
him
with
writs
of
eviction
to
compel
him
to
pay
a
high
rent
on
his
own
improvements
more
than
half
the
population
of
ireland
consists
of
tenants
and
their
families
occupying
small
holdings
paying
less
than
a
year
of
rent
of
an
immense
majority
of
these
small
holdings
two
things
may
be
safely
asserted
first
that
the
total
gross
value
of
the
produce
is
insufficient
after
paying
the
rent
to
leave
a
decent
subsistence
for
the
cultivator
secondly
that
this
rent
is
levied
to
a
great
extent
on
the
improvements
of
the
tenant
or
his
predecessors
throughout
the
poorer
parts
of
ireland
the
greater
part
of
the
soil
in
its
natural
state
of
bog
or
mountain
is
not
worth
a
rent
of
a
shilling
an
acre
but
some
poor
peasant
urged
by
the
which
results
from
the
absence
of
other
sources
of
employment
squats
upon
it
builds
a
wretched
cottage
delves
drains
fences
and
reclaims
a
few
acres
of
land
so
as
to
bear
a
scanty
crop
of
oats
and
potatoes
when
he
has
done
so
the
landlord
or
agent
comes
to
him
and
says
land
is
worth
ten
or
fifteen
shillings
an
acre
according
to
the
standard
of
rents
in
the
district
and
you
must
pay
it
or
turn
out
and
the
law
backs
him
in
saying
so
by
writs
of
eviction
and
police
put
yourself
in
poor
place
and
say
if
you
would
love
the
law
and
be
it
would
take
me
too
far
from
the
scope
of
this
volume
into
the
field
of
contemporary
politics
if
i
attempted
to
point
out
who
is
to
blame
for
this
state
of
things
or
what
are
the
remedies
it
is
enough
to
say
that
this
is
the
real
irish
problem
and
to
point
to
it
as
an
instance
of
the
calamitous
effects
which
inevitably
follow
when
the
instincts
of
a
whole
population
are
brought
by
an
unfavourable
combination
of
circumstances
into
necessary
and
natural
antagonism
with
the
laws
which
they
are
bound
to
obey
conservative
legislation
by
whatever
party
it
is
introduced
really
means
making
the
law
correspond
with
the
common
sense
and
common
morality
of
all
except
the
criminal
and
crotchety
classes
so
that
the
majority
may
feel
it
to
be
their
friend
for
instance
the
most
truly
conservative
measure
of
recent
times
was
probably
that
which
legalised
unions
and
gave
full
liberty
to
combine
for
an
increase
of
wages
the
old
legal
maxim
that
such
combinations
were
illegal
as
being
in
restraint
of
trade
was
so
obviously
an
invention
of
the
members
of
the
upper
caste
who
wore
horsehair
wigs
to
give
their
fellows
of
the
same
caste
who
employed
labour
an
unfair
advantage
that
it
could
not
fail
to
cause
feelings
of
discontent
and
exasperation
among
the
masses
of
by
its
repeal
the
sting
has
been
taken
out
of
socialism
and
the
british
has
come
to
be
in
the
main
a
reasonable
citizen
on
whom
incitements
to
violence
in
order
to
inaugurate
utopias
fall
as
lightly
as
the
howlings
of
the
barren
east
wind
on
the
it
has
led
also
to
reasonable
and
peaceful
adjustment
of
disputes
between
employers
and
labourers
by
arbitration
and
instead
of
by
strikes
and
in
the
united
states
of
america
the
instinct
is
even
stronger
we
find
that
strikes
attended
with
violence
are
almost
always
confined
mainly
to
the
foreign
element
of
recently
imported
immigrants
and
that
the
american
citizen
considers
the
laws
as
his
own
laws
and
is
determined
to
have
them
respected
the
balance
between
the
conservative
and
progressive
tendencies
is
however
at
the
best
always
imperfect
and
inclines
too
much
sometimes
in
one
and
sometimes
in
the
other
direction
in
england
the
conservative
tendency
has
had
on
the
whole
too
much
preponderance
i
do
not
speak
of
political
institutions
for
in
these
of
late
years
the
balance
has
been
pretty
equally
preserved
but
in
practical
matters
there
is
still
a
good
deal
of
stolid
obstruction
this
is
most
apparent
in
law
and
in
education
the
common
or
law
though
on
the
whole
and
upright
is
fettered
by
so
many
technicalities
and
musty
precedents
that
it
fails
in
a
great
many
instances
to
be
what
civil
law
ought
to
be
a
cheap
speedy
and
intelligible
instrument
for
enforcing
honest
dealings
between
man
and
man
one
of
our
greatest
railway
contractors
once
said
to
me
i
want
to
make
an
agreement
which
shall
be
absolutely
binding
i
make
it
myself
on
a
sheet
of
if
i
want
to
have
a
loophole
i
send
it
to
my
lawyer
to
have
it
drawn
up
in
legal
language
and
engrossed
on
sheets
of
another
man
of
large
experience
in
commercial
and
financial
matters
laid
down
this
axiom
you
want
to
know
what
is
the
law
in
a
doubtful
case
reason
out
what
is
the
view
of
it
and
assume
that
the
direct
opposite
is
probably
the
these
may
be
extreme
instances
as
all
such
epigrammatic
sentences
generally
are
but
it
is
undeniable
that
they
have
a
considerable
basis
of
substantial
truth
and
that
law
with
its
dilatory
processes
its
enormous
expense
and
its
uncertain
conclusions
may
be
and
often
is
not
an
instrument
of
justice
but
a
weapon
in
the
hands
of
an
unscrupulous
adventurer
or
of
a
dishonest
rich
man
to
extort
blackmail
or
to
defeat
just
claims
again
what
nation
but
england
would
tolerate
so
long
a
system
of
land
law
so
bristling
with
antiquated
technicalities
so
tedious
and
so
expensive
as
almost
to
amount
to
a
prohibition
of
the
transfer
of
land
in
small
quantities
or
could
let
the
private
interests
of
a
mere
handful
of
professional
lawyers
stand
in
the
way
of
a
codification
of
laws
and
a
registration
of
titles
education
is
another
subject
which
shows
how
difficult
it
is
to
move
the
sluggish
instincts
of
the
english
mind
in
the
direction
of
progress
when
not
stimulated
by
political
conflict
what
is
education
the
word
tells
its
own
story
it
is
to
not
to
to
unfold
the
capacities
of
the
growing
mind
strengthen
the
reasoning
faculty
create
an
interest
in
the
surrounding
universe
in
a
word
to
excite
a
love
of
knowledge
and
impart
the
means
of
acquiring
it
for
the
mass
of
the
population
education
is
necessarily
confined
in
a
great
measure
to
the
latter
object
the
three
writing
and
indispensable
requisites
and
the
acquirement
of
these
with
perhaps
a
few
elements
of
history
and
geography
absorbs
nearly
all
the
time
and
opportunity
that
can
be
afforded
for
attendance
at
school
for
any
culture
beyond
this
the
great
majority
must
depend
on
themselves
in
after
life
but
there
are
a
large
number
of
parents
of
the
upper
and
middle
classes
who
can
and
do
keep
their
children
at
school
for
eight
or
ten
years
and
spend
a
large
sum
of
money
in
giving
them
what
is
called
a
higher
education
what
is
there
to
show
for
this
time
and
money
even
in
the
case
of
the
highest
schools
which
ought
to
give
the
highest
education
on
the
credit
side
a
little
latin
and
less
greek
plenty
of
cricket
and
athletics
good
physical
training
and
best
of
all
on
the
whole
a
manly
honourable
and
gentlemanlike
spirit
but
on
the
debit
side
absolute
ignorance
except
in
the
case
of
a
few
unusually
clever
and
ambitious
boys
of
all
that
a
cultivated
man
of
the
nineteenth
century
ought
to
know
no
french
no
german
and
what
is
worse
no
english
the
average
boy
can
neither
write
his
own
language
legibly
nor
grammatically
and
if
he
goes
straight
from
a
public
school
into
a
competitive
examination
stands
an
excellent
chance
of
being
plucked
for
spelling
and
what
is
worst
of
all
he
not
only
knows
nothing
but
cares
to
know
nothing
his
reasoning
faculty
has
never
been
cultivated
and
his
interest
in
interesting
things
has
never
been
awakened
what
is
the
first
lesson
he
has
had
to
learn
qu√¶
maribus
dicantur
mascula
dicas
that
is
words
appropriated
to
males
are
called
lesson
which
elicits
as
much
reasoning
faculty
and
creates
as
much
interest
as
if
he
had
been
made
to
commit
to
memory
that
things
made
of
gold
are
called
golden
suppose
instead
of
this
that
the
lesson
had
been
that
two
volumes
of
hydrogen
combine
with
one
volume
of
oxygen
to
form
water
the
exercise
to
the
memory
is
the
same
but
how
different
is
the
amount
of
thought
and
interest
evoked
especially
if
the
experiment
is
made
before
the
class
and
each
boy
has
to
repeat
it
for
himself
how
many
new
subjects
of
interest
would
this
open
up
in
the
mind
of
any
lad
of
average
intelligence
how
strange
that
there
should
be
airs
other
than
the
air
we
breathe
which
can
be
weighed
and
measured
and
that
two
of
them
by
combining
shall
produce
their
exact
weight
of
a
substance
so
unlike
them
as
water
or
if
the
exercise
of
a
class
were
to
look
through
a
microscope
at
the
leaf
of
a
plant
or
wing
of
an
insect
and
try
who
could
best
draw
what
they
had
seen
and
write
a
description
of
it
in
a
legible
hand
and
in
good
english
how
many
faculties
would
this
call
into
play
compared
with
the
dull
routine
of
parsing
a
latin
sentence
or
writing
a
halting
copy
of
greek
iambics
even
grammar
the
one
thing
which
is
supposed
to
be
taught
thoroughly
is
taught
so
unintelligently
that
it
awakens
no
interest
beyond
that
of
a
parrot
learning
by
rote
from
qu√¶
the
scholar
passes
to
in
pr√¶senti
perfectum
format
in
avi
without
an
attempt
to
explain
what
language
really
means
how
it
originates
from
and
how
these
inflections
of
and
are
part
of
the
devices
which
certain
families
of
mankind
including
our
own
have
invented
as
a
mechanism
for
attaching
shades
of
meaning
such
as
present
and
past
to
the
primitive
root
even
the
alphabet
intelligently
taught
opens
up
wide
fields
of
interesting
matter
as
to
the
history
of
ancient
nations
and
their
successive
attempts
to
analyse
the
component
sounds
of
their
spoken
words
and
to
pass
from
primitive
to
phonetic
symbols
but
the
instructors
of
the
budding
manhood
of
the
of
the
nation
like
gallio
for
none
of
these
things
and
the
organisation
of
our
higher
schools
seems
to
be
stereotyped
on
the
principle
that
they
are
made
for
teachers
rather
than
for
scholars
and
that
their
chief
is
to
enable
a
limited
number
of
highly
respectable
gentlemen
from
the
universities
to
realise
comfortable
incomes
with
a
maximum
of
holidays
and
a
minimum
of
trouble
and
the
parents
support
the
system
because
so
many
of
them
really
reverence
rank
more
than
knowledge
and
are
willing
to
compound
for
their
sons
growing
up
ignorant
idle
and
extravagant

by
any
chance
they

galton
in
the
course
of
his
interesting
inquiries
as
to
the
effect
of
heredity
and
education
on
character
and
attainments
took
the
very
practical
course
of
addressing
a
set
of
questions
to
some
hundred
and
eighty
of
our
most
distinguished
men
as
to
the
hereditary
qualities
of
their
ancestors
and
the
various
influences
which
they
considered
had
done
most
to
promote
or
to
retard
their
success
in
life
of
course
he
received
a
variety
of
answers
homines
tot
sententi√¶
but
upon
one
point
there
was
a
striking
unanimity
almost
all
expressed
a
hatred
of
grammar
and
the
classics
and
an
utter
distaste
for
the
system
of
education
there
were
none
who
had
passed
through
this
old
high
and
dry
education
who
were
satisfied
with
it
those
who
came
from
the
greater
schools
usually
did
nothing
there
and
have
abused
the
system
and
yet
the
system
goes
on
and
the
eton
latin
grammar
will
probably
be
taught
and
hexameters
written
for
another
generation
surely
the
needle
swings
here
too
strongly
towards
the
negative
or
obstructive
pole
the
instances
are
so
numerous
in
social
and
practical
life
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
look
at
both
sides
of
the
shield
that
the
difficulty
is
in
selection
take
the
case
of
patriotism
patriotism
is
beyond
all
doubt
a
great
fact
the
fertile
mother
of
many
of
the
higher
and
heroic
virtues
who
does
not
sympathise
with
the
legends
of
wallace
and
william
tell
and
scorn
with
walter
scott
the
man
with
soul
so
dead
who
never
to
himself
has
said
this
is
my
own
my
native
land
and
yet
how
thin
a
line
of
partition
separates
it
from
arrogance
and
insolent
ignorance
reflected
in
the
latter
form
from
paris
in
hysterical
shouts
now
of
berlin
√†
berlin
and
now
bas
perfide
albion
we
call
it
and
recognise
it
as
an
unlovely
exhibition
but
call
it
and
let
it
take
the
form
of
the
bellowings
of
some
stupid
bull
as
the
red
flag
now
of
a
french
and
now
of
a
russian
scare
crosses
his
line
of
vision
and
we
are
blind
to
its
deformity
still
there
is
another
side
to
the
shield
for
even
which
is
only
another
word
for
patriotism
run
mad
is
more
respectable
than
the
opposite
extreme
of
a
sordid
and
narrow
minded
parochialism
which
shrinks
behind
the
streak
measures
everything
by
the
standard
of
pounds
shillings
and
pence
and
with
what
tennyson
calls
the
craven
fear
of
being
great
groans
over
the
responsibilities
of
extended
empire
the
growth
of
such
a
spirit
among
prominent
politicians
of
the
advanced
liberal
school
seems
to
me
one
of
the
most
alarming
symptoms
of
the
day
but
i
take
comfort
when
i
reflect
that
the
most
democratic
community
in
the
world
that
of
the
united
states
is
precisely
the
one
which
has
shown
most
determination
to
maintain
its
national
greatness
if
necessary
by
the
sword
and
has
made
the
greatest
sacrifices
for
that
object
if
the
were
a
miserable
minority
in
america
why
should
we
be
afraid
of
our
ever
becoming
a
majority
in
old
england
in
this
as
in
all
similar
cases
it
is
evident
that
true
statesmanship
consists
in
hitting
the
happy
mean
and
doing
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
and
that
true
strength
stands
firm
in
the
middle
between
the
two
opposite
poles
while
weakness
is
drawn
by
one
or
other
of
the
conflicting
attractions
into
the
falsehood
of
extremes
when
sir
robert
peel
some
forty
years
ago
announced
his
conversion
by
the
unadorned
eloquence
of
richard
cobden
and
free
trade
was
inaugurated
with
results
which
were
attended
with
the
most
brilliant
success
every
one
expected
that
the
conversion
of
the
rest
of
the
civilised
world
was
only
a
question
of
time
and
that
a
short
time
few
would
have
been
found
bold
enough
to
predict
that
forty
years
later
england
would
stand
almost
alone
in
the
world
in
adherence
to
principles
and
that
the
protectionist
heresy
would
not
only
be
strengthened
and
confirmed
among
continental
nations
such
as
france
and
germany
but
actually
adopted
by
large
and
increasing
majorities
in
the
united
states
canada
australia
and
other
communities
yet
such
is
the
actual
fact
at
the
present
day
in
spite
of
the
cobden
club
and
of
arguments
which
to
the
average
english
mind
appear
irresistible
free
trade
has
been
steadily
losing
ground
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
nation
after
nation
colony
after
colony
sees
its
protectionist
majority
increasing
and
its
minority
dwindling
it
is
evident
there
must
be
some
real
cause
for
such
a
universal
phenomenon
in
countries
like
france
and
russia
we
may
attribute
it
to
economical
ignorance
and
the
influence
of
cliques
of
manufacturers
and
selfish
interests
but
the
people
of
germany
and
still
more
of
the
united
states
canada
and
australia
are
as
intelligent
as
ourselves
and
quite
as
shrewd
in
seeing
where
those
interests
really
lie
they
are
fettered
by
no
traditional
prejudices
and
their
political
instincts
rather
lie
towards
freedom
and
against
the
creation
of
anything
like
an
aristocracy
of
wealthy
manufacturers
and
yet
after
years
of
free
discussion
they
have
become
more
and
more
hardened
in
their
protectionist
heresies
what
does
this
prove
that
there
are
two
sides
to
the
shield
and
not
as
we
fancied
in
our
english
insularity
only
one
free
trade
is
undoubtedly
the
best
or
rather
the
only
possible
policy
for
a
country
like
england
with
thirty
millions
of
inhabitants
producing
food
for
less
than
half
the
number
and
depending
on
foreign
trade
for
the
supplies
necessary
to
keep
the
other
half
alive
it
is
the
best
policy
also
for
a
country
which
owing
to
its
mineral
resources
its
accessibility
by
sea
to
markets
its
accumulated
capital
and
the
inherited
qualities
physical
and
moral
of
its
working
population
has
unrivalled
advantages
for
cheap
production
nor
can
any
dispassionate
observer
dispute
that
in
england
which
is
such
a
country
free
trade
has
worked
well
it
has
not
worked
miracles
it
has
not
introduced
an
industrial
millennium
the
poor
are
still
with
us
and
it
has
not
saved
us
from
our
share
of
commercial
depressions
but
on
the
whole
national
wealth
has
greatly
increased
and
what
is
more
important
national
has
increased
with
it
the
mass
of
the
population
and
especially
the
working
classes
get
better
wages
work
shorter
hours
and
are
better
fed
better
clothed
and
better
educated
than
they
were
forty
years
ago
this
is
one
side
of
the
shield
and
it
is
really
a
golden
and
not
an
illusory
one
but
look
at
the
other
side
take
the
case
of
a
country
where
totally
opposite
conditions
prevail
where
there
is
no
surplus
population
unlimited
land
limited
capital
labour
scarce
and
dear
and
no
possibility
of
competing
in
the
foreign
or
even
in
the
home
market
with
the
manufactures
which
with
free
trade
would
be
poured
in
by
countries
like
england
in
prior
possession
of
all
the
elements
of
cheap
production
it
is
by
no
means
so
clear
that
protection
to
enable
native
industries
to
take
root
and
grow
may
not
in
such
cases
be
the
wisest
policy
take
as
a
simple
illustration
the
case
of
an
australian
colony
imposing
an
import
duty
on
foreign
boots
and
shoes
there
is
not
a
doubt
that
this
is
practically
taxing
the
immense
majority
of
colonists
who
wear
and
do
not
make
these
articles
but
on
the
other
hand
it
makes
the
colony
a
possible
field
for
emigration
for
all
the
shoemakers
of
europe
and
shoemaking
a
trade
to
which
any
australian
with
a
large
family
can
bring
up
one
of
his
sons
looking
at
it
from
the
strict
point
of
view
of
the
most
rigid
political
economist
the
maximum
production
of
wealth
which
is
the
better
policy
the
production
of
wealth
we
must
recollect
depends
on
labour
and
productive
labour
depends
on
the
labourer
finding
his
is
employment
at
which
he
can
work
a
labourer
who
can
not
find
work
at
living
wages
is
worse
than
a
zero
he
is
a
negative
quantity
as
far
as
the
accumulation
of
wealth
is
concerned
on
the
other
hand
every
workman
who
finds
work
even
if
it
may
not
be
of
the
ideally
best
description
is
a
machine
what
he
spends
on
himself
and
his
family
gives
employment
to
other
workmen
and
the
work
must
be
poor
indeed
if
the
produce
of
a
labour
is
not
more
than
the
cost
of
a
subsistence
the
surplus
adds
to
the
national
capital
and
thus
capital
and
population
go
on
increasing
in
geometrical
progression
the
first
problem
therefore
for
a
new
or
a
backward
country
is
to
find
fair
wages
for
a
fair
work
for
as
many
hands
as
possible
the
problem
of
making
that
employment
the
most
productive
possible
is
a
secondary
one
which
will
solve
itself
in
each
case
rather
by
actual
practice
than
by
abstract
theory
this
much
however
is
pretty
clear
that
in
order
to
secure
the
maximum
of
employment
it
must
be
varied
all
are
not
fit
for
agricultural
work
and
even
if
they
were
if
the
conditions
of
soil
and
climate
favour
large
estates
and
sheep
or
cattle
runs
rather
than
small
farms
a
large
amount
of
capital
may
provide
work
for
only
a
small
number
of
labourers
on
social
and
moral
grounds
also
apart
from
dry
considerations
of
political
economy
progress
intelligence
and
a
higher
standard
of
life
are
more
likely
to
be
found
with
large
cities
manufactures
and
a
variety
of
industrial
occupations
than
with
a
dead
level
of
a
few
millionaires
and
a
few
shepherds
or
of
a
few
landlords
and
a
dense
population
of
poor
peasants
if
protection
is
the
price
which
must
be
paid
to
render
such
a
larger
life
possible
it
may
be
sound
policy
to
pay
it
and
the
result
seems
to
show
that
neither
it
nor
free
trade
is
inconsistent
with
rapid
progress
while
on
the
other
hand
neither
of
them
affords
an
absolute
immunity
from
the
evils
that
dog
the
footsteps
of
progress
and
from
the
periods
of
reaction
and
depression
which
accompany
vicissitudes
of
trade
here
as
in
other
cases
there
are
two
sides
of
the
shield
and
true
statesmanship
consists
in
seeing
both
and
doing
the
right
thing
at
the
right
place
and
at
the
right
time
if
free
trade
is
as
we
believe
ultimately
to
prevail
it
will
be
an
affair
of
time
the
real
trial
of
protection
comes
when
it
has
stimulated
production
to
a
point
which
gluts
the
home
market
and
leaves
a
surplus
which
must
be
exported
exports
of
articles
the
cost
of
which
has
been
artificially
raised
by
protection
can
not
compete
in
the
market
with
the
cheaper
products
of
countries
vicissitudes
therefore
of
prosperity
and
depression
must
tend
to
become
more
frequent
and
more
severe
and
if
production
goes
on
a
point
must
be
reached
where
at
whatever
cost
it
must
either
be
arrested
or
made
capable
of
competing
in
the
wider
market
the
united
states
are
probably
not
far
from
such
a
point
and
it
would
have
been
already
reached
but
for
the
immense
and
unexhausted
resources
of
that
vast
continent
in
france
the
point
has
apparently
been
reached
and
we
find
that
with
a
lower
scale
of
wages
than
in
england
it
is
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
every
day
to
maintain
that
lower
scale
and
the
export
trade
of
its
manufactured
goods
to
foreign
markets
protection
leading
to
higher
wages
and
profits
than
can
be
permanently
maintained
and
artificially
enhancing
the
cost
of
living
to
the
working
classes
threatens
more
and
more
every
day
to
introduce
strained
relations
between
capital
and
labour
in
most
countries
of
europe
the
relation
between
capital
and
labour
affords
a
good
instance
of
the
inevitable
error
of
applying
hard
and
fast
logical
conclusions
to
the
complex
and
problems
of
actual
life
ricardo
and
other
distinguished
writers
on
political
economy
have
assumed
that
the
two
constitute
a
fundamental
antagonistic
polarity
wealth
they
say
is
the
joint
product
of
capital
and
labour
and
as
in
the
case
of
a
cake
which
has
to
be
divided
between
c
and
l
the
more
c
gets
the
less
is
left
for
l
and
the
theory
sounds
plausible
but
what
says
fact
in
the
most
unmistakable
manner
it
pronounces
as
the
outcome
of
practical
experience
that
the
profits
of
capital
and
the
wages
of
labour
rise
and
fall
together
high
profits
mean
high
wages
rising
profits
rising
wages
falling
profits
falling
wages
it
has
been
proved
so
in
a
thousand
instances
and
not
one
can
be
quoted
where
the
one
factor
has
varied
in
an
inverse
and
not
in
a
direct
ratio
with
the
other
it
is
obvious
that
there
must
be
some
fallacy
in
argument
the
fallacy
is
this
he
assumes
the
cake
to
be
of
fixed
dimensions
whereas
in
point
of
fact
it
varies
sometimes
diminishing
to
zero
or
even
to
a
negative
quantity
at
others
expanding
to
many
times
its
original
size
a
new
is
discovered
in
a
remote
country
and
forthwith
profits
rise
to
cent
per
and
wages
to
a
pound
a
day
a
bad
season
and
depression
of
trade
overtake
an
old
country
and
the
gross
value
of
the
produce
of
many
a
farm
is
insufficient
to
cover
expenses
and
depreciation
even
if
the
labourers
worked
for
nothing
the
polarity
is
therefore
confined
to
the
limited
and
temporary
case
of
the
division
of
the
profit
where
there
is
a
profit
in
particular
trades
and
in
individual
instances
and
this
is
regulated
mainly
by
the
accustomed
scale
of
wages
and
standard
of
living
of
the
workmen
and
their
opportunities
of
finding
employment
elsewhere
if
dissatisfied
with
the
terms
offered
to
them
on
the
whole
it
may
be
said
that
capital
has
the
best
of
it
on
a
rising
and
wages
on
a
falling
market
a
manufacturer
or
profit
may
rise
from
five
to
twenty
per
cent
without
quadrupling
the
rate
of
wages
but
on
the
other
hand
it
may
fall
from
twenty
per
cent
to
five
or
even
for
a
time
below
zero
without
a
proportionate
diminution
in
the
price
paid
for
labour
capital
is
in
fact
the
great
insurer
of
labour
the
flywheel
which
regulates
the
motion
of
the
industrial
machine
this
will
be
best
illustrated
by
a
practical
instance
the
brighton
railway
company
for
several
consecutive
years
paid
no
dividend
or
only
a
trifling
amount
on
the
capital
but
during
the
whole
of
this
time
it
gave
steady
employment
at
good
wages
to
upwards
of
ten
thousand
workmen
the
blaenavon
coal
and
iron
company
in
south
wales
was
for
many
years
a
losing
concern
and
successive
capitalists
lost
the
best
part
of
a
million
pounds
in
it
until
at
length
it
was
reorganised
with
a
small
capital
and
became
a
fairly
prosperous
concern
during
the
whole
of
this
time
it
gave
employment
at
fair
wages
to
several
thousand
workmen
which
had
the
best
of
it
in
these
two
cases
capital
or
labour
and
where
would
the
workmen
have
been
on
any
communistic
or
system
in
fact
it
will
be
apparent
to
any
one
who
will
study
dispassionately
the
statistics
of
any
line
of
inquiry
such
as
the
scale
of
wages
the
price
of
provisions
the
accumulations
of
savings
banks
and
provident
societies
for
the
last
twenty
years
that
the
working
classes
have
had
the
share
of
the
vast
increase
which
has
taken
place
in
the
wealth
and
income
of
the
nation
i
am
glad
that
it
is
so
for
it
is
better
both
morally
and
politically
that
the
condition
of
the
masses
should
be
improved
and
their
standard
of
living
raised
than
that
capital
should
accumulate
too
exclusively
in
large
masses
still
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
such
large
accumulations
let
us
go
to
the
united
states
of
america
for
an
illustration
where
everything
is
on
a
large
scale
and
colossal
fortunes
have
been
made
in
a
few
years
the
by
which
most
of
these
fortunes
have
been
made
may
be
described
according
to
the
way
we
look
at
it
either
as
railway
jobbing
or
as
pioneering
the
way
in
useful
enterprise
the
construction
of
the
first
railway
across
the
continent
to
california
is
a
typical
instance
a
clique
or
syndicate
of
wealthy
speculators
make
surveys
and
estimates
of
a
line
across
deserts
and
over
mountain
ranges
and
ascertain
pretty
accurately
what
it
will
cost
they
form
a
company
with
a
capital
of
double
that
cost
and
by
subventions
from
the
government
grants
of
land
and
sale
of
mortgage
bonds
raise
the
half
really
required
and
hold
the
other
half
in
shares
as
profit
in
paper
the
line
is
made
and
if
the
traffic
turns
out
well
and
there
is
a
period
of
speculation
in
the
money
market
the
paper
is
turned
into
dollars
and
if
the
line
really
costs
say
or
the
promoters
realise
an
equal
amount
as
profit
this
has
two
sides
to
it
it
is
doubtless
bad
for
the
public
to
have
to
pay
rates
which
give
a
return
on
twice
the
actual
cost
and
the
possession
of
a
close
monopoly
in
the
hands
of
a
few
millionaires
may
be
abused
to
the
detriment
of
individual
traders
but
on
the
other
hand
the
railway
could
not
have
been
made
in
any
other
way
if
it
had
been
necessary
to
wait
until
the
slow
growth
of
population
insured
such
a
traffic
as
would
induce
the
ordinary
public
to
subscribe
for
shares
at
par
you
might
have
waited
for
twenty
years
before
a
single
mile
of
railway
was
made
west
of
the
mississippi
nor
is
this
all
the
enormous
profit
realised
in
the
first
of
these
enterprises
led
to
a
rush
of
rich
speculators
into
the
lottery
of
pushing
railways
ahead
of
traffic
in
which
there
were
such
magnificent
prizes
the
continent
was
covered
by
new
railways
built
to
create
new
traffic
rather
than
to
provide
for
that
which
already
existed
and
the
traffic
was
created
though
as
the
lottery
contained
blanks
as
well
as
prizes
many
of
the
original
promoters
were
ruined
the
second
great
line
spanning
the
northern
two
successive
sets
of
promoters
and
is
only
now
beginning
to
be
moderately
successful
but
the
final
result
has
been
that
while
british
india
which
went
on
what
may
be
called
the
respectable
system
of
getting
a
worth
of
work
for
every
pound
raised
has
only
miles
of
railway
the
united
states
under
the
speculative
system
has
got
miles
i
can
not
doubt
that
the
national
wealth
of
america
is
greater
at
the
present
day
than
if
there
had
been
no
jay
goulds
or
vanderbilts
and
the
construction
of
her
railways
had
been
delayed
on
the
average
for
twenty
years
the
contrast
between
labour
and
capital
or
free
trade
and
protection
is
only
a
particular
case
of
the
larger
polarity
between
what
is
called
in
scientific
language
egoism
and
altruism
or
in
more
popular
phraseology
individualism
and
socialism
according
to
one
theory
the
best
result
is
obtained
by
leaving
individuals
as
free
as
possible
to
act
on
their
own
suggestions
of
their
duties
and
interests
and
confining
the
intervention
of
the
state
to
enforcing
laws
for
the
protection
of
life
and
property
and
such
measures
as
are
obviously
necessary
for
the
safety
of
society
according
to
the
other
theory
the
state
ought
to
interfere
wherever
the
results
of
individual
liberty
lead
to
abuses
and
should
endeavour
to
create
a
society
as
near
to
ideal
perfection
as
possible
by
administering
and
regulating
the
public
and
private
affairs
of
its
citizens
it
is
obvious
that
the
question
has
two
sides
that
extreme
conclusions
in
either
direction
are
as
is
always
the
case
invariably
false
individualism
carried
too
far
would
disintegrate
society
it
would
be
impossible
to
leave
it
to
the
selfishness
of
every
citizen
to
say
whether
an
army
and
navy
should
be
maintained
for
national
defence
and
taxes
should
be
levied
for
their
support
individualism
also
easily
passes
over
into
a
hard
and
cruel
selfishness
which
recognises
no
obligation
beyond
the
letter
of
the
law
and
acts
practically
on
the
principle
of
one
for
himself
and
the
devil
take
the
it
is
this
phase
of
individualism
which
makes
enthusiasts
and
men
of
strong
moral
and
religious
sympathies
declaim
so
vehemently
against
and
cry
aloud
like
carlyle
for
a
hero
or
benevolent
despot
who
is
to
scourge
humanity
into
the
practice
of
all
the
virtues
on
the
other
hand
socialism
if
not
confined
within
rigid
limits
of
experience
and
common
sense
is
even
more
destructive
in
its
consequences
civilised
society
is
based
on
the
security
of
private
property
and
the
observance
of
contracts
if
these
are
liable
not
merely
to
be
regulated
in
extreme
and
exceptional
cases
but
to
be
absolutely
condemned
in
principle
as
by
socialists
of
the
proudhon
school
who
declare
propri√©t√©
le
vol
or
overruled
and
set
aside
whenever
they
are
thought
to
conflict
with
humanitarian
scruples
or
sentimental
aspirations
society
would
be
dissolved
into
its
elements
to
crystallise
anew
about
some
military
dictator
or
other
strong
form
of
repressive
government
who
could
restore
it
to
a
state
of
stable
equilibrium
in
accordance
with
these
fundamental
laws
no
society
based
on
the
community
of
goods
has
ever
existed
except
on
a
very
limited
scale
and
for
a
very
short
time
under
some
strong
temporary
influence
such
as
religious
excitement
in
the
early
christian
church
it
only
existed
as
long
as
its
members
were
a
handful
of
humble
individuals
who
were
impressed
with
the
idea
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
close
at
hand
and
that
sacrifices
made
on
earth
would
be
repaid
at
an
early
day
with
compound
interest
in
heaven
they
acted
on
what
was
almost
as
much
a
principle
of
enlightened
selfishness
as
if
they
had
placed
their
money
on
the
best
possible
security
at
the
highest
possible
interest
the
only
existing
society
as
far
as
i
am
aware
which
has
everything
in
common
is
a
small
sect
of
shakers
in
the
united
states
which
owes
its
limited
success
to
two
that
there
is
no
marrying
or
giving
in
marriage
secondly
that
a
member
invented
a
patent
which
are
hardly
likely
to
survive
in
the
struggle
for
life
and
become
a
type
for
general
adoption
the
nearest
approach
to
communism
in
practical
operation
on
a
large
scale
is
that
of
the
village
communities
of
russia
and
parts
of
india
which
certainly
show
no
signs
of
being
progressive
types
destined
to
gain
ground
on
the
contrary
they
fail
to
fulfil
what
is
the
first
condition
of
an
agricultural
community
that
of
obtaining
a
fair
average
produce
from
the
soil
and
the
more
enterprising
and
intelligent
moujiks
or
ryots
invariably
seek
to
obtain
something
which
they
can
call
their
own
and
are
not
obliged
to
share
with
the
idle
and
improvident
a
conclusive
objection
to
all
schemes
of
socialism
or
communism
is
that
they
not
only
crush
out
all
individual
initiative
and
enterprise
in
material
life
but
that
they
also
destroy
all
incentives
to
individual
charity
and
benevolence
why
make
sacrifices
to
help
others
if
they
are
already
helped
at
your
expense
by
the
state
this
is
no
theoretical
objection
but
has
been
proved
practically
by
the
history
of
the
poor
laws
what
scope
for
individual
charity
was
there
in
a
parish
like
that
in
buckinghamshire
where
under
the
old
poor
law
the
rate
had
risen
to
twenty
shillings
in
the
pound
and
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
was
abandoned
or
even
in
less
extreme
cases
any
one
who
is
acquainted
with
remote
rural
parishes
inhabited
by
cotters
and
small
farmers
must
be
aware
that
the
poor
law
operates
strongly
to
destroy
the
feeling
of
manly
independence
and
family
affection
which
induced
the
poor
to
support
their
own
aged
and
infirm
relatives
in
many
parts
of
scotland
with
which
i
am
personally
acquainted
men
who
a
generation
ago
would
have
thought
it
a
disgrace
to
ask
for
help
to
support
an
aged
father
or
mother
now
think
it
only
fair
play
after
having
contributed
for
years
to
the
poor
rate
to
try
and
get
something
out
of
it
in
return
altruism
as
herbert
spencer
well
puts
it
if
carried
to
excess
defeats
itself
for
in
annihilating
egoistic
vices
it
annihilates
egoistic
virtues
and
the
result
is
result
which
as
abhors
a
vacuum
can
happily
never
be
attained
and
the
precepts
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
must
always
remain
maxims
of
private
morality
rather
than
of
state
regulation
it
is
of
little
use
however
to
deal
with
such
generalities
as
long
as
we
confine
ourselves
to
extreme
instances
on
either
side
it
is
as
easy
as
it
is
idle
to
refute
them
profitable
discussion
only
begins
when
we
enter
on
the
wide
intermediate
space
which
lies
between
the
extreme
frontier
provinces
and
instead
of
arguing
for
absolute
conclusions
endeavour
to
discover
the
happy
mean
in
doubtful
cases
where
there
really
are
limitations
of
time
and
circumstance
and
a
good
deal
which
may
be
reasonably
said
on
each
side
of
the
question
take
for
instance
the
case
of
contract
which
has
been
so
much
discussed
with
reference
to
the
irish
question
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
that
the
enforcement
of
contracts
is
one
of
the
principal
duties
of
a
government
the
principle
of
may
occasionally
lead
to
results
not
altogether
consistent
with
strict
morality
but
there
will
always
be
fools
in
the
world
and
it
is
better
they
should
pay
for
their
folly
than
that
the
state
should
be
perpetually
interfering
in
the
vain
attempt
to
protect
them
the
bargain
may
be
a
bad
one
but
it
is
far
better
that
men
should
be
held
to
their
bargains
than
that
every
loser
should
have
a
loophole
provided
to
escape
by
appealing
to
some
legal
quibble
or
tribunal
of
arbitration
but
there
are
limits
to
this
salutary
principle
the
contract
must
be
a
free
one
freely
entered
into
by
parties
who
meet
on
equal
terms
if
it
is
a
compulsory
one
which
the
weaker
party
has
practically
no
option
of
refusing
the
case
is
altered
thus
in
the
case
of
children
it
is
absurd
to
say
that
they
are
free
agents
in
contracting
for
the
disposal
of
their
labour
and
the
state
properly
interferes
by
factory
acts
to
limit
the
number
of
hours
for
which
they
are
to
work
so
in
the
relations
between
landlord
and
tenant
whenever
they
meet
on
equal
terms
and
the
tenant
has
an
option
of
either
taking
or
refusing
to
take
a
farm
at
the
rent
asked
both
sides
must
be
held
to
their
bargain
however
disadvantageous
it
may
turn
out
for
either
of
them
but
if
the
landlord
is
practically
omnipotent
and
the
tenant
has
no
alternative
but
to
promise
to
pay
an
impossible
rent
or
to
be
turned
out
on
the
roadside
and
die
of
starvation
it
is
by
no
means
so
clear
that
the
state
should
enforce
the
bargain
unless
the
landlord
submits
to
equitable
terms
or
again
if
the
rent
is
not
due
to
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
land
but
is
a
confiscation
of
the
improvements
it
is
far
from
being
that
the
law
should
look
only
at
rights
and
forget
all
about
duties
it
is
a
question
rather
of
fact
than
of
argument
or
assertion
whether
such
a
state
of
things
does
or
does
not
prevail
at
any
particular
time
in
any
particular
country
if
the
contracts
were
fair
bargains
entered
into
by
free
agents
they
ought
to
be
enforced
whether
prices
have
risen
or
fallen
leaving
it
to
the
humanity
and
of
landlords
to
make
reasonable
reductions
but
if
they
were
no
more
equal
bargains
than
those
of
slaves
or
the
state
might
fairly
interfere
to
attach
equitable
conditions
to
the
enforcement
of
inequitable
contracts
the
antithesis
between
the
rights
and
duties
of
property
especially
in
the
case
of
land
is
one
which
raises
many
nice
and
difficult
questions
some
theorists
like
henry
george
are
for
solving
it
by
ignoring
the
rights
altogether
according
to
them
private
property
in
land
is
the
source
of
all
the
evils
that
afflict
modern
society
poverty
depressions
of
trade
low
profits
and
low
wages
are
caused
by
the
constant
drift
towards
high
rents
due
to
the
possession
by
a
small
section
of
the
community
of
a
monopoly
in
that
which
is
as
much
a
necessity
of
existence
as
air
or
water
abolish
private
property
in
land
and
straightway
you
will
have
the
millennium
in
this
extreme
form
the
fallacy
of
the
argument
is
obvious
you
can
not
stop
at
land
but
must
have
the
courage
of
your
opinion
and
go
the
full
length
with
proudhon
of
denouncing
all
property
as
robbery
for
if
the
right
of
individual
property
is
the
first
condition
of
civilised
society
you
can
hardly
exclude
that
form
of
it
which
in
all
ages
and
all
countries
has
been
practically
the
most
powerful
incentive
to
progress
and
civilisation
compare
the
united
states
of
america
under
their
homestead
laws
with
russia
under
a
system
of
village
communes
or
the
california
of
with
that
of
fifty
years
ago
under
the
jesuit
padres
and
you
will
see
that
the
desire
to
acquire
property
in
land
has
been
what
may
be
called
the
steam
supplying
the
motive
power
to
reclaim
continents
and
multiply
population
nor
in
principle
is
there
any
argument
for
the
confiscation
of
land
which
would
not
equally
apply
to
the
confiscation
of
any
other
sort
of
property
when
theorists
philanthropic
at
other
expense
thought
that
the
owner
had
more
than
was
good
for
him
or
had
acquired
it
as
an
unearned
increment
without
working
for
it
suppose
two
men
a
and
b
employed
as
on
an
american
railway
have
each
saved
a
hundred
dollars
the
railway
has
been
a
failure
intended
to
reach
a
distant
terminus
it
has
stopped
halfway
in
a
desert
for
want
of
funds
and
for
years
has
paid
no
dividend
the
shares
are
only
worth
ten
and
the
land
at
the
distant
terminus
is
only
worth
ten
dollars
an
acre
but
a
and
b
are
sharp
fellows
and
see
that
if
speculation
ever
revives
the
line
will
probably
be
completed
and
both
shares
and
land
will
become
valuable
a
buys
ten
shares
with
his
hundred
dollars
and
b
ten
acres
of
land
the
boom
comes
the
capital
is
found
the
line
completed
and
the
shares
rise
to
par
and
the
land
to
a
hundred
dollars
an
acre
a
and
b
have
each
realised
nine
hundred
dollars
by
what
may
be
described
as
you
like
to
put
it
either
as
an
unearned
increment
or
as
providence
and
foresight
on
what
principle
can
you
confiscate
nine
hundred
dollars
because
it
is
in
land
and
leave
untouched
because
it
is
in
shares
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
we
come
to
more
complex
cases
in
which
land
is
held
in
large
masses
fenced
in
not
by
the
natural
right
of
a
man
to
the
produce
of
his
own
exertions
but
by
artificial
legal
systems
of
inheritance
and
settlement
we
are
on
neutral
ground
where
fair
discussion
is
possible
as
to
the
limitations
and
conditions
under
which
the
state
may
afford
its
protection
landed
property
is
more
the
creature
of
law
and
runs
greater
risks
in
case
of
revolution
or
communistic
legislation
than
personal
property
which
is
more
easily
concealed
or
transferred
it
is
not
unreasonable
therefore
that
it
should
pay
a
higher
insurance
in
the
form
of
taxation
and
especially
when
it
passes
by
inheritance
or
settlement
when
the
new
title
is
to
a
great
extent
artificial
and
the
creation
of
the
law
no
one
can
dispute
the
abstract
justice
of
a
succession
duty
on
all
property
landed
or
personal
in
proportion
to
its
amount
passing
by
operation
of
law
the
only
question
can
be
as
to
the
amount
and
the
expediency
of
confining
it
within
limits
that
shall
not
trench
on
confiscation
or
impair
the
desire
to
accumulate
capital
and
in
the
case
of
land
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
are
a
good
many
instances
in
which
the
question
of
the
is
raised
more
forcibly
than
in
the
case
of
ordinary
property
take
a
practical
instance
within
my
own
knowledge
for
an
illustration
is
often
better
than
an
argument
there
was
a
mountain
property
in
wales
which
as
a
sheep
or
cattle
farm
might
be
worth
at
the
outside
a
year
coal
and
iron
were
discovered
under
it
capitalists
sank
pits
and
erected
works
two
or
three
sets
lost
their
money
but
the
works
were
carried
on
a
large
amount
of
labour
was
employed
and
in
course
of
time
a
town
of
some
eight
or
nine
thousand
inhabitants
sprang
up
the
a
year
grew
into
from
fixed
rents
and
royalties
which
he
has
enjoyed
for
the
last
thirty
years
through
good
times
and
bad
without
being
called
on
to
contribute
a
penny
towards
schools
churches
roads
sewers
water
or
any
of
the
local
objects
necessary
for
the
civilised
existence
of
the
population
of
eight
thousand
whose
labour
has
added
to
his
wealth
i
do
not
blame
him
the
law
told
him
to
do
what
he
liked
with
his
own
and
it
probably
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
under
any
moral
obligation
to
go
beyond
the
law
but
i
do
think
that
the
law
would
have
been
more
just
and
better
for
the
interests
of
the
community
if
it
had
made
some
portion
of
this
unearned
increment
of
a
year
liable
for
a
contribution
towards
the
sanitary
and
other
objects
essential
for
the
decent
existence
of
the
town
which
had
grown
up
on
this
property
and
given
it
this
increased
value
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
centuries
of
landlord
legislation
and
of
a
public
opinion
based
mainly
on
that
of
the
wealthy
and
specially
of
the
landed
classes
have
made
our
laws
in
many
respects
too
favourable
to
the
predominant
interests
and
that
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
now
is
and
properly
is
in
the
direction
of
recognising
the
duties
as
well
as
the
rights
of
property
we
must
take
care
however
not
to
let
it
swing
too
far
in
this
direction
for
of
the
two
evils
it
is
better
to
put
up
with
occasional
cases
of
hardship
and
oppression
on
the
part
of
bad
landlords
than
to
endanger
the
security
of
property
by
reforms
pushed
to
extremes
at
the
dictation
of
impulsive
masses
designing
demagogues
or
sentimental
philanthropists
herbert
spencer
in
his
works
on
sociology
often
dwells
with
great
force
on
the
evils
which
arise
from
state
interference
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
is
very
undesirable
that
the
state
should
become
a
sort
of
and
undertake
branches
of
business
which
can
be
conducted
by
private
enterprise
it
is
undesirable
for
two
reasons
first
because
the
work
is
certain
to
cost
more
and
be
worse
done
secondly
for
the
still
more
important
reason
that
it
tends
to
extinguish
individual
enterprise
strangle
progress
with
and
teach
a
nation
to
look
like
children
to
outside
guidance
rather
than
like
men
to
their
own
still
the
question
has
two
sides
whatever
individual
enterprise
can
do
should
be
left
to
it
but
there
are
in
the
complex
conditions
of
modern
society
a
number
of
things
which
can
not
be
done
by
individuals
and
which
must
either
be
left
undone
or
done
by
the
state
or
by
some
local
authority
company
or
other
sanctioned
by
the
state
thus
if
it
were
a
question
of
bringing
coals
from
newcastle
by
sea
no
one
would
suggest
that
the
state
should
interfere
with
the
private
enterprise
of
individual
shipowners
but
to
bring
them
by
land
requires
railways
and
railways
can
only
be
built
by
capitals
beyond
the
reach
of
private
individuals
if
the
state
had
not
delegated
a
portion
of
its
powers
to
companies
not
a
ton
of
coal
would
ever
have
been
brought
by
land
to
london
and
if
the
state
may
thus
occasionally
delegate
its
powers
with
advantage
to
the
community
there
are
cases
in
which
it
may
with
equal
advantage
undertake
itself
branches
of
the
business
for
instance
the
postal
service
the
advantages
of
a
cheap
and
uniform
system
for
the
collection
and
delivery
of
letters
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
are
so
great
that
they
far
outweigh
any
theoretical
objections
to
state
interference
possibly
some
of
the
larger
towns
might
have
been
as
well
or
better
served
by
private
enterprise
but
no
district
would
have
had
a
and
the
enormous
commercial
and
educational
benefits
of
the
penny
post
would
have
been
in
a
great
measure
lost
to
the
community
the
case
of
telegraphs
is
not
so
clear
probably
on
the
whole
the
advantages
of
a
uniform
state
management
preponderate
but
there
are
drawbacks
which
make
it
doubtful
even
at
a
sixpenny
rate
a
great
deal
of
the
telegraphic
communication
of
the
large
towns
and
active
centres
of
business
is
taxed
to
make
up
for
the
deficiency
of
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
and
invention
and
improvement
in
telegraphy
are
no
doubt
checked
to
a
considerable
extent
by
creating
a
state
monopoly
whose
first
duty
it
is
to
try
to
satisfy
its
masters
at
the
treasury
by
making
the
system
pay
when
we
come
to
railways
we
are
on
debateable
ground
and
it
is
fairly
arguable
that
they
should
be
worked
by
the
state
for
the
public
good
but
the
objections
here
outweigh
the
advantages
every
one
who
has
any
practical
experience
of
the
working
of
railways
must
be
aware
that
the
simplicity
and
uniformity
of
the
penny
postal
system
are
totally
inapplicable
and
that
the
traffic
of
the
country
requires
above
all
things
great
freedom
and
elasticity
in
meeting
day
by
day
the
varying
contingencies
which
arise
here
is
an
illustration
in
a
certain
town
in
france
on
a
railway
worked
by
the
state
it
was
determined
to
have
a
in
order
to
raise
funds
for
a
hospital
and
as
an
attraction
to
bring
down
from
paris
a
small
troop
of
actors
and
have
a
play
in
the
evening
the
question
turned
on
the
railway
consenting
to
give
them
a
reduced
fare
for
the
return
journey
the
manager
of
the
railway
was
quite
willing
but
said
that
he
had
no
power
to
alter
the
tariff
without
permission
from
the
minister
of
public
works
the
permission
was
applied
for
and
the
result
was
that
it
arrived
exactly
on
the
day
twelve
months
after
the
had
been
held
contrast
this
with
the
case
of
the
general
manager
of
the
london
and
north
western
railway
sitting
in
his
office
at
euston
and
receiving
half
a
dozen
telegrams
asking
him
to
quote
special
rates
one
perhaps
for
beef
from
chicago
to
london
another
for
emigrants
from
hamburg
to
new
york
liverpool
and
all
requiring
telegraphic
answers
then
and
there
if
the
business
is
to
be
done
at
all
again
if
railways
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
state
i
do
not
suppose
that
we
should
have
had
half
our
present
mileage
for
the
treasury
would
never
have
sanctioned
the
outlay
of
public
money
on
lines
which
could
not
show
the
prospect
of
a
fair
return
on
the
capital
and
it
would
have
vetoed
any
multiplication
of
trains
or
reduction
of
rates
which
threatened
loss
to
the
exchequer
i
can
speak
with
some
authority
on
this
point
for
i
have
been
both
chairman
of
a
railway
company
and
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
i
am
certain
that
in
the
former
capacity
i
have
introduced
important
innovations
such
as
excursion
trains
and
cheap
periodical
tickets
by
which
the
public
have
greatly
benefited
which
i
should
have
vetoed
in
the
latter
capacity
still
there
may
be
exceptional
cases
as
that
of
ireland
where
an
unreasonable
number
of
poor
companies
in
a
poor
country
wrangling
among
themselves
and
giving
a
bad
service
at
an
excessive
cost
intensify
social
and
political
evils
where
the
arguments
in
favour
of
a
state
purchase
may
outweigh
the
objections
and
the
extent
and
nature
of
state
control
over
british
railways
is
always
a
question
fairly
open
to
discussion
in
other
departments
the
supply
of
articles
such
as
water
and
gas
and
the
enforcement
of
sanitary
conditions
are
probably
best
left
to
local
authorities
in
the
latter
case
under
some
central
supervision
to
see
that
the
duty
is
not
evaded
wherever
neglect
involves
danger
to
others
as
in
the
case
of
and
other
contagious
epidemics
it
is
clear
that
the
decision
can
not
be
left
to
individuals
and
the
state
is
bound
to
interfere
to
enforce
rational
precautions
so
also
the
state
is
bound
to
undertake
trades
which
are
essential
for
the
protection
of
the
nation
against
foreign
enemies
our
dockyards
and
arsenals
may
and
doubtless
do
often
make
mistakes
and
turn
out
expensive
work
but
we
could
not
safely
leave
the
building
of
ironclads
and
supply
of
cannon
solely
to
private
enterprise
for
there
is
no
such
large
and
steady
demand
for
such
articles
as
would
induce
a
number
of
private
firms
to
erect
works
and
keep
up
establishments
adequate
to
supply
the
wants
which
might
arise
in
an
emergency
in
all
such
matters
therefore
of
national
defence
we
must
put
up
with
a
certain
amount
of
drawbacks
incidental
to
state
management
and
confine
ourselves
to
endeavouring
to
reduce
them
to
a
minimum
and
this
is
to
a
great
extent
within
the
power
of
the
nation
and
its
parliament
by
applying
principles
of
business
to
national
expenditure
and
seeing
that
while
on
the
one
hand
we
get
as
nearly
as
possible
a
worth
of
work
for
every
pound
spent
on
the
other
hand
we
do
not
spend
nineteen
shillings
uselessly
because
some
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
wants
to
gain
momentary
popularity
by
the
wise
and
pound
economy
of
docking
the
extra
shilling
off
the
necessary
estimates
in
private
life
a
man
gets
on
by
knowing
when
to
spend
as
well
as
when
not
to
spend
and
true
economy
has
no
greater
foe
than
spasmodic
parsimony
alternating
almost
certainly
with
spasmodic
extravagance
it
would
be
easy
to
multiply
instances
for
there
are
few
phases
of
political
and
practical
life
to
which
the
principle
of
polarity
does
not
apply
where
extremes
are
not
false
and
where
there
is
not
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
both
sides
of
the
question
but
the
very
obviousness
of
the
principle
makes
it
difficult
to
deal
with
it
generally
without
degenerating
into
commonplace
while
to
trace
its
application
exhaustively
in
any
one
instance
would
require
a
volume
those
who
wish
to
pursue
the
subject
further
will
do
well
to
study
the
works
of
herbert
spencer
where
they
will
find
the
application
of
general
principles
to
all
the
problems
of
sociology
treated
with
a
depth
of
philosophic
insight
and
an
abundance
and
aptness
of
illustration
which
i
can
not
pretend
to
equal
my
ambition
is
of
a
humbler
nature
i
do
not
expect
to
set
the
thames
on
fire
or
to
produce
a
revolution
in
modern
thought
but
i
do
hope
that
the
views
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
express
may
do
somewhat
to
make
some
readers
more
tolerant
and
charitable
in
their
judgments
less
bitter
and
in
controversy
and
that
whatever
truth
there
may
be
in
my
ideas
will
contribute
to
form
a
small
part
neither
more
nor
less
than
it
deserves
of
the
great
body
of
truth
which
is
handed
down
from
the
present
to
succeeding
generations
and
which
becomes
long
after
i
am
there
to
witness
it
the
inheritance
of
the
human
race
in
the
course
of
its
evolution
and
now
before
i
take
my
final
leave
of
the
reader
let
me
for
a
few
moments
throw
the
reins
on
the
neck
of
fancy
and
suppose
myself
standing
with
that
group
of
parsees
by
the
shore
of
the
indian
ocean
listening
to
its
murmured
rhythm
inhaling
the
balmy
air
watching
the
silver
crescent
of
the
new
moon
and
musing
on
the
wise
sayings
of
the
ancient
sage
the
sum
of
the
reflections
which
i
have
tried
to
embody
in
the
preceding
pages
would
take
form
and
crystallise
in
the
following
sonnet
