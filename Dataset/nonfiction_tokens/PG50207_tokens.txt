part
i
introduction
there
is
no
article
handled
by
the
grocer
which
demands
greater
attention
engages
more
of
his
time
or
has
a
more
important
bearing
upon
the
success
of
his
business
than
tea
as
it
stands
in
many
respects
far
ahead
of
all
the
other
commodities
in
commanding
and
maintaining
patronage
as
well
as
in
attracting
and
retaining
trade
for
numerous
other
articles
and
at
the
same
time
yielding
a
larger
margin
of
profit
to
the
dealer
gain
being
the
fundamental
object
of
all
business
transactions
and
as
tea
to
the
grocer
plays
such
an
essential
part
in
determining
this
profit
we
may
be
excused
if
in
considering
the
article
from
a
purely
practical
standpoint
we
urge
the
relation
which
it
has
to
the
success
of
the
dealer
and
who
as
a
general
rule
experiences
much
more
difficulty
in
the
judicious
selection
of
his
tea
than
in
any
other
staple
he
trades
in
the
cause
of
this
difficulty
is
obvious
to
dealers
in
tea
in
general
being
entirely
due
to
the
numerous
varieties
and
almost
innumerable
grades
flavors
and
characters
of
the
commodity
with
which
he
is
confronted
and
to
be
selected
from
in
order
to
satisfy
the
diversity
of
tastes
and
various
preferences
to
be
catered
to
in
order
to
please
each
individual
taste
and
preference
it
therefore
requires
no
ordinary
skill
or
brief
experience
to
make
the
proper
selection
or
combination
to
suit
the
consumer
under
these
trying
circumstances
the
acquisition
of
such
skill
or
knowledge
for
all
practical
purposes
is
not
however
quite
as
difficult
as
is
supposed
by
many
dealers
it
being
fairly
obtained
by
an
intelligent
study
of
the
leading
varieties
and
grades
most
in
demand
in
the
country
or
section
of
consumption
in
addition
to
a
few
simple
and
inexpensive
experiments
by
the
dealer
in
order
to
familiarize
himself
with
the
leading
characters
and
values
of
the
different
varieties
grades
and
flavors
of
the
teas
best
adapted
to
each
particular
class
or
section
of
the
country
in
which
he
may
be
doing
business
little
is
known
comparatively
in
this
country
particularly
of
the
art
or
principle
of
blending
or
of
teas
the
american
dealer
and
consumer
alike
being
averse
to
the
practice
as
a
general
rule
regarding
it
as
about
on
a
parity
with
the
other
too
numerous
forms
of
adulteration
and
sophistication
now
in
vogue
not
only
in
the
countries
of
consumption
but
also
in
those
of
production
such
objections
however
are
entirely
erroneous
as
it
is
an
acknowledged
fact
that
a
combination
of
different
varieties
of
wheat
make
better
flour
the
same
being
true
of
coffee
and
many
other
staples
of
diet
and
drink
so
that
the
practice
of
blending
teas
for
the
consumer
if
properly
understood
and
skillfully
and
judiciously
performed
would
prove
a
more
satisfactory
one
to
the
consumer
and
at
the
same
time
a
more
profitable
one
to
the
dealer
the
object
of
blending
being
not
as
the
public
imagines
to
lower
the
standard
or
reduce
the
cost
at
the
expense
of
quality
but
to
produce
a
measurably
better
tea
and
obtain
a
fuller
and
heavier
liquor
in
addition
to
a
much
finer
and
more
desirable
flavor
than
that
yielded
by
any
single
variety
when
used
alone
tea
in
short
giving
better
satisfaction
to
the
consumer
at
a
more
moderate
price
and
at
the
same
time
allowing
a
better
margin
of
profit
to
the
dealer
without
lowering
his
standard
of
to
illustrate
a
dealer
may
already
be
selling
a
tea
to
his
customers
possessing
a
pleasing
and
suitable
flavor
but
be
lacking
in
body
or
too
light
in
liquor
whereas
by
his
adding
to
it
a
small
proportion
of
one
or
two
other
varieties
possessing
these
requisite
properties
the
defect
is
easily
and
inexpensively
remedied
and
a
infusion
is
produced
the
drawing
and
drinking
qualities
of
the
tea
being
improved
all
round
without
extra
cost
to
the
dealer
or
increase
of
price
to
the
consumer
it
must
therefore
follow
that
by
the
skillful
and
judicious
mixing
or
blending
of
a
number
of
teas
each
differing
in
variety
or
grade
a
more
uniform
pleasing
and
palatable
tea
that
is
one
richer
in
liquor
heavier
in
body
and
more
aromatic
in
flavor
can
be
produced
by
this
now
acknowledged
principle
at
a
more
moderate
cost
to
dealer
and
consumer
than
can
otherwise
be
obtained
from
any
single
variety
or
grade
of
tea
the
idea
of
blending
teas
originally
arose
from
the
experience
incidentally
gained
by
some
old
and
tea
dealers
that
a
beverage
richer
in
liquor
more
pleasing
in
flavor
more
satisfactory
in
price
to
the
consumer
and
less
costly
to
the
dealer
could
be
produced
from
a
number
of
the
different
varieties
or
grades
when
skillfully
amalgamated
or
judiciously
combined
than
could
otherwise
be
obtained
from
any
single
sort
when
used
alone
no
sooner
was
this
experience
confirmed
than
the
or
blending
of
teas
was
generally
resorted
to
by
many
of
those
who
had
the
dispensing
of
the
commodity
to
the
public
but
while
some
dealers
had
a
marked
success
in
this
branch
of
the
tea
business
from
the
start
others
again
who
attempted
to
practice
it
failed
completely
in
their
efforts
to
produce
any
satisfactory
results
to
themselves
or
their
customers
the
end
accomplished
being
instead
of
an
improvement
an
injury
and
detriment
to
the
quality
and
value
of
the
teas
so
combined
more
often
to
such
an
extent
that
the
single
and
regular
variety
of
tea
in
demand
would
have
pleased
better
at
less
labor
time
and
cost
to
the
dealer
the
cause
of
this
failure
was
however
due
entirely
and
alone
to
the
want
of
that
necessary
training
experience
or
intelligent
knowledge
which
would
enable
the
unskilled
blender
to
understand
the
peculiar
characteristics
and
affinities
of
the
different
varieties
and
various
grades
of
the
teas
which
are
improved
by
combination
and
their
component
parts
as
well
as
to
avoid
those
which
are
deteriorated
by
the
amalgamation
the
knowledge
and
skill
required
for
this
very
particular
and
precise
branch
of
the
tea
business
being
only
attained
in
its
perfection
by
numerous
tests
and
constant
experiments
which
are
best
performed
by
the
admixture
of
from
two
to
five
or
more
in
many
instances
small
samples
of
tea
differing
frequently
materially
in
variety
character
and
quality
and
alternately
changing
altering
and
substituting
the
varieties
and
proportions
of
the
same
until
the
dealer
has
finally
succeeded
in
producing
a
tea
unique
in
character
identified
with
himself
and
differing
in
every
respect
from
that
of
any
tea
offered
or
sold
by
his
competitors
the
liquor
flavor
and
aroma
of
which
will
prove
more
pleasing
and
satisfactory
in
quality
and
price
to
his
patrons
and
at
a
more
moderate
cost
to
himself
time
and
experience
have
proved
beyond
question
that
skillful
and
judicious
tea
blending
will
be
found
to
amply
repay
for
all
the
study
labor
and
expense
bestowed
on
it
by
the
dealer
as
the
chief
and
only
difficulty
existing
in
the
art
lies
in
the
fact
of
first
finding
a
combination
or
combinations
that
will
please
the
majority
of
consumers
but
it
is
an
egregious
mistake
to
imagine
that
the
successful
or
profitable
blending
of
teas
consists
solely
in
the
indiscriminate
or
injudicious
heaping
together
carelessly
and
indifferently
of
two
or
more
varieties
or
grades
of
tea
in
one
homogeneous
mass
without
the
slightest
regard
to
quantity
quality
affinity
affiliation
or
assimilation
of
leaf
liquor
character
or
flavor
of
the
component
parts
while
on
the
contrary
the
art
or
principle
consists
in
the
proper
combining
of
two
or
more
different
varieties
or
grades
of
tea
intended
to
form
the
combination
on
an
at
least
intelligent
or
judicious
if
not
scientific
manner
so
as
to
yield
a
unique
or
particular
tea
of
uniform
quality
strength
flavor
and
pungency
at
a
given
price
being
at
the
same
time
pleasing
and
satisfactory
to
the
average
consumer
and
maintaining
its
standard
of
quality
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
but
while
it
may
be
admitted
that
it
is
difficult
to
master
the
art
of
successful
tea
blending
thoroughly
without
the
serving
of
an
apprenticeship
to
the
business
and
that
the
combinations
that
may
be
found
in
it
are
almost
kaleidoscopic
in
their
range
still
even
the
veriest
novice
need
not
spoil
good
tea
by
injudicious
mixing
as
all
that
is
required
is
a
little
study
and
a
few
simple
rules
carefully
followed
although
these
can
not
be
substituted
entirely
for
years
of
practical
experience
in
such
a
difficult
and
at
the
present
time
most
essential
branch
of
the
tea
business
but
will
nevertheless
prevent
any
serious
error
and
at
the

authorities
claiming
that

produced
from

plant
exclusively
and
the

from

solely

it

by

prepared

one

due

to

disparity

careful
investigation
disprove
these
particular
opinions
as
while
it
is
now
admitted
even
by
the
chinese
themselves
that
both
kinds
may
be
produced
at
will
from
either
or
both
species
of
the
tea
plant
it
is
a
popular
error
to
imagine
that
china
produces
the
two
commercial
kinds
in
all
districts
as
the
preparation
of
the
greater
proportion
of
the
respective

to

which
though
not

an
indication
of
its

considerable
to
do
with
its

and
value
choice
teas
of
all
kinds
being
handsomely
made
and
pleasing
to
the
eye
they
are
compactly
if
not
artistically
curled

rolled
according
to
their
make
whether
green
or
black
and
all
teas
are
fine
in
proportion
to
their
youth
and
tenderness
the
ripest
and
juiciest
curling
up
tightest
and
retaining
their

is

loosely
made
in
proportion
to
their
age

and
period
of
picking

being
partially
or
totally
devoid

they
are
correspondingly
coarse

in
the
infused
state
by
feeling

pressing
judging
a
sample
of
tea
by
feeling
or
pressing
in
the
hand
is
more
applicable
to
the
curled
twisted
or
black
tea
sorts
than
to
the
rolled
or
green
tea
kinds
for
instance
if
the
leaves
of
the
former

so
tested
be
really
choice
they
will
be
found
smooth
crisp
and
elastic
in
the
hand
and
capable
of
resisting
a
gentle
but
firm
pressure
without
breaking
but
if
the
leaves
be
old
and
sapless
they
will
be
found
tough
and
chaffy
to
the
touch
very
brittle
breaking
easily
and
crumbling
under
the
same
conditions
smelling
or
inhaling
by
blowing
or
breathing
heavily
upon
a
sample
of
tea
and
then
quickly
smelling
or
inhaling
the
odor
emitted
from
it
a
very
fair
estimate
of
its
general
character
may
be
formed
by
the
dealer
to
judge
correctly
by
this
method
however
an
acquaintance
with
the
distinctive
flavors
and
peculiarities
will
be
necessary
this
knowledge
being
best
acquired
by
the
dealer
adopting
a
type
or
standard
sample
of
the
teas
he
is
using
or
wants
to
match
by
masticating
or
chewing
an
approximate
estimate
of
a
tea
may
also
be
formed
by
chewing
or
masticating
the
leaves
a
good
tea
being
easily
recognized
by
the
rapid
manner
in
which
the
leaves
are
dissolved
on
slight
mastication
if
the
tea
be
young
and
the
leaves
tender
they
become
quickly
reduced
to
a
pasty
consistency
and
very
juicy
but
if
old
and
inferior
they
will
be
found
difficult
to
chew
tough
and
yielding
little
or
no
sap
according
to
its
age
and
inferiority
infusing
or
drawing
is
after
all
is
said
the
most
satisfactory
and
reliable
a
method
of
testing
or
appraising
a
tea
at
its
true
value
this
being
the
manner
adopted
by
all
expert
dealers
and
brokers
in
tea
for
this
method
a
number
of
small
cups
scales
and
a
weight
are
necessary
together
with
a
clean
kettle
of
freshly
distilled
or
filtered
water
briskly
boiling
and
poured
on
the
leaves
after
which
they
are
allowed
to
infuse
from
three
to
five
minutes
before
smelling
and
tasting
the
water
used
must
in
all
cases
be
as
soft
and
pure
as
can
be
obtained
boiled
briskly
and
used
only
at
the
boiling
point
that
is
it
must
boil
but
not
overboil
as
if
allowed
to
do
so
for
even
a
few
minutes
it
will
not
extract
in
its
entirety
the
full
strength
or
flavor
of
the
tea
as
the
value
of
a
tea
commercially
depends
principally
upon
the
weight
and
flavor
of
the
infusion
as
well
as
in
the
aroma
imparted
to
it
by
the
volatile
oil
which
it
contains
so
the
intrinsic
value
of
a
tea
is
based
principally
on
the
amount
of
extract
which
it
yields
on
infusion
in
addition
to
the
quantity
of
the
theine
and
tannin
contained
therein
again
the
taste
for
a
particular
variety
of
tea
being
an
acquired
and
not
a
natural
one
it
follows
that
persons
accustomed
to
a
certain
variety
or
flavor
in
tea
want
that
particular
kind
and
will
not
be
satisfied
with
any
other
even
if
better
or
this
fact
being
admitted
it
becomes
essential
to
the
success
of
the
tea
dealer
to
study
and
learn
the
tastes
and
preferences
of
his
patrons
in
order
to
cater
satisfactorily
to
them
to
illustrate
he
may
be
selling
his
trade
a
amoy
oolong
or
foochow
and
suddenly
change
off
to
a
fine
formosa
or
congou
in
such
a
case
his
customers
will
be
very
apt
to
find
fault
with
the
latter
no
matter
how
fine
they
may
be
it
therefore
becomes
essential
to
the
success
of
the
dealer
to
pay
particular
attention
to
the
quality
and
standard
of
the
teas
he
is
purchasing
as
there
is
no
article
which
he
handles
that
will
attract
trade
or
retain
it
longer
than
a
good
tea
at
a
legitimate
price
such
a
tea
creating
more
comment
in
a
district
than
any
other
article
used
at
table
and
to
such
an
extent
that
if
the
customers
once
lose
confidence
in
either
the
ability
or
honesty
of
the
dealer
in
supplying
them
they
will
be
repelled
rather
than
attracted
it
being
next
to
impossible
to
draw
them
back
again
once
they
leave
through
any
mistake
of
the
dealer
in
his
selection
poor
or
badly
selected
teas
will
drive
more
customers
away
from
a
store
in
a
week
than
can
be
made
in
a
year
so
that
it
will
not
pay
the
dealer
to
make
any
serious
error
in
the
selection
of
his
teas
such
mistake
proving
fatal
to
the
holding
or
increasing
of
his
tea
trade
as
well
as
for
other
articles
it
is
therefore
much
better
and
more
profitable
in
the
end
to
handle
only
good
teas
on
fair
and
legitimate
margin
than
to
sell
poor
inferior
and
unsatisfactory
teas
at
a
larger
margin
of
profit
a
dealer
with
any
ambition
to
increase
or
even
retain
his
tea
trade
should
no
more
attempt
to
handle
poor
inferior
dusty
musty
or
damaged
teas
than
a
butcher
has
to
sell
tainted
meats
or
a
baker
to
give
his
customers
sour
bread
the
offense
may
not
at
first
seem
as
objectionable
but
the
final
verdict
of
his
customers
will
be
the
same
in
each
case
and
the
positive
manner
in
which
they
will
eventually
manifest
their
opinion
will
be
to
quit
dealing
with
him
altogether
good
clean
pure

teas
can
always
be
purchased
at
a
few
cents

the
price
of
the
dusty

sour

now
flooding
the
market
so
that
by
the
mistaken
policy
of
trying
to
save
a
few
cents
per
pound
extra
the
seed
is
sown
for
the
final
ruin
of
the
dealer
himself
in
addition
to
casting
discredit
on
the
use
of
tea
as
an
article
of
diet
while
on
the
other
hand
if
the
dealer
makes
a
small
but
necessary
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
future
gain
and
reputation
by
selling
only
tea
that
is
tea
and
content
himself
with
a
fair
but
legitimate

will
be
given
to

peculiarity
the

kinds

affected
being
the
too
teas
the
teas
and
those
that
possess
a
loose
rough
or
open
leaf
when
to
buy
teas
the
tea
market
fluctuating
considerably
sometimes
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
dealer
to
learn
to
understand
something
of
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
which
to
a
great
extent
affects
the
fluctuations
of
the
tea
market
before
he
can
be
sure
of
making
desirable
purchases
the
dealer
in
tea
who
not
only
understands
the
article
he
is
dealing
in
but
whose
knowledge
and
judgment
enable
him
in
addition
to
make
his
purchases
about
the
proper
time
possesses
many
advantages
over
his
competitors
the
value
of
which
can
not
be
overestimated
for
instance
each
season
on
the
arrival
of
the
first
steamers
from
china
and
japan
high
prices
rule
for
the
earliest
pickings
and
if
the
market
be
bare
of
chance
lots
these
full
prices
are
continued
for
some
time
thereafter
then
follows
a
dull
drooping
market
from
which
the
dealer
derives
no
satisfaction
but
should
the
demand
at
first
be
high
and
the
stocks
large
through
dealers
declining
to
purchase
at
full
figures
prices
rapidly
decline
to
a
more
reasonable
level
after
which
they
then
continue
comparatively
steady
for
the
balance
of
the
year
unless
some
outside
causes
should
arise
to
create
an
advance
for
these
reasons
dealers
would
do
well
to
take
advantage
of
the
fine
selections
of
teas
that
arrive
during
july
august
and
september
from
china
and
japan
in
the
purchase
of
india
and
ceylon
teas
it
will
also
be
found
necessary
to
watch
the
new
arrivals
closely
as
after
the
heavy
receipts
during
october
and
november
the
market
is
nearly
always
easier
but
when
the
arrivals
are
light
the
market
is
much
higher
these
facts
are
worth
the
special
attention
of
dealers
as
india
and
ceylon
teas
although
until
quite
recently
comparatively
unknown
now
form
some
of
the
principal
kinds
for
blending
purposes
with
the
great
reduction
in
the
importation
prices
and
the
keener
competition
among
dealers
the
retail
prices
of
tea
have
been
brought
down
to
a
very
low
figure
and
as
dealers
generally
have
educated
the
public
to
the
purchase
of
poor
and
trashy
teas
at
low
prices
it
is
not
probable
that
the
retail
prices
will
ever
again
reach
any
higher
figures
unless
war
or
other
similar
cause
should
lead
to
a
duty
being
placed
upon
the
commodity
yet
notwithstanding
these
unprecedented
low
prices
the
per
capita
consumption
of
tea
is
comparatively
very
small
in
this
country
at
the
present
time
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
this
small
consumption
is
directly
traceable
to
the
custom
now
prevalent
among
retail
dealers
of
charging
exorbitant
profits
on
inferior
teas
in
order
to
make
up
for
losses
sustained
on
other
goods
together
with
the
forcing
of
poor
teas
on
their
customers
these
unwise
and
impolitic
practices
might
be
overlooked
were
it
not
for
the
greater
mistake
made
of
sacrificing
quality
to
profit
which
in
an
article
of
daily
and
almost
universal
use
like
tea
is
an
important
consideration
so
that
by
rectifying
this
error
and
giving
more
attention
to
the
careful
selection
of
his
teas
by
the
dealer
there
is
no
valid
reason
why
the
consumption
of
the
article
could
not
be
at
least
doubled
in
a
short
time
in
this
country
part
iv
adulteration
and
detection
the
teas
of
commerce
are
subject
to
three
principal
forms
of
adulteration
viz
facing
or
coloring
with
deleterious
compounds
in
order
to
enhance
their
appearance
mixing
with
spurious
and
spent
or
once
used
leaves
with
the
object
of
increasing
their
bulk
and
sanding
or
adulterating
with
mineral
matter
to
add
to
their
weight
but
it
is
against
the
two
first
most
commonly
dangerous
forms
of
adulteration
that
the
principal
efforts
of
dealers
and
tea
inspectors
should
more
particularly
be
directed
the
latter
having
received
some
attention
from
analysts
and
chemists
but
not
to
that
extent
which
the
importance
of
the
subject
merits
of
the
various
forms
of
adulteration
practiced
in
china
and
japan
the
facing
or
artificial
coloring
of
green
teas
is
perhaps
the
most
prevalent
and
glaring
the
material
used
for
the
purpose
being
usually
composed
of
prussian
blue
china
clay
gypsum
turmeric
and
indigo
the
process
of
coloring
green
teas
is
performed
by
placing
a
portion
of
the
prussian
blue
in
a
large
bowl
and
crushing
it
into
a
fine
powder
a
small
quantity
of
gypsum
is
then
added
and
the
two
substances
ground
and
mixed
together
in
the
proportions
of
one
part
blue
to
four
parts
of
the
gypsum
both
making
in
combination
a
light
blue
preparation
in
which
state
it
is
applied
to
the
leaves
during
the
last
process
of
firing
one
ounce
of
this
coloring
matter
will
face
or
color
from
fifteen
to
twenty
pounds
of
tea
leaves
imparting
to
them
a
dull
color
and
a
greasy
appearance
readily
detected
in
the
hand
when
green
or
japan
teas
are
heavily
coated
in
this
manner
it
may
be
readily
recognized
by
their
heavy
color
and
oily
or
greasy
appearance
in
the
hand
or
better
still
by
placing
a
small
sample
of
the
leaves
on
a
piece
of
glass
and
allowing
them
to
rest
there
for
some
minutes
then
on
removing
them
the
coloring
matter
if
any
will
be
found
adhering
to
the
glass
and
its
nature
whether
prussian
blue
indigo
or
soapstone
detected
by
the
aid
of
a
small
microscope
but
when
only
lightly
colored
the
best
method
is
to
put
the
leaves
in
a
cup
or
glass
and
pour
boiling
water
on
them
stirring
them
up
well
meantime
and
then
straining
the
infusion
through
a
thin
muslin
cloth
and
the
coloring
matter
will
be
found
deposited
in
the
cloth
or
forming
a
sediment
at
the
bottom
or
sides
of
the
vessel
into
which
they
are
strained
what
are
known
to
trade
as
teas
that
is
teas
artificially
manufactured
from
leaves
once
used
or
tea
dust
and
a
preparation
of
gum
or
glue
to
hold
them
together
and
then
colored
and
glazed
to
give
them
a
pleasing
appearance
to
the
eye
are
best
detected
by
crushing
the
leaves
between
the
fingers
or
hands
upon
which
they
leave
a
yellowish
stain
greasy
in
nature
if
spurious
leaves
or
again
by
pulverizing
a
small
quantity
of
the
alleged
tea
leaves
and
putting
them
in
a
cup
or
glass
and
pouring
on
boiling
water
they
will
immediately
begin
to
disintegrate
and
form
a
thick
gluey
deposit
at
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
pasty
in
nature
the
coloring
matter
adhering
to
the
bottom
or
sides
of
the
cup
or
glass
another
form
of
adulteration
practiced
principally
in
china
is
the
admixture
of
spurious
or
foreign
leaves
obtained
from
other
plants
such
as
the
willow
plum
ash
and
what
is
known
in
trade
as
ankoi
tea
millions
of
pounds
of
such
spurious
tea
leaves
are
annually
picked
cured
and
colored
in
the
same
manner
as
tea
in
some
of
the
chinese
tea
districts
and
used
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
bulk
and
decreasing
the
cost
of
genuine
teas
this
form
of
adulteration
however
being
only
trivial
when
compared
with
the
former
one
such
spurious
or
foreign
leaves
in
a
tea
are
best
detected
by
their
botanical
character
that
is
by
the
absence
of
the
special
structural
marks
which
distinguish
the
genuine
tea
leaf
from
that
of
the
leaves
from
all
other
plants
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
for
while
it
is
admitted
that
the
tea
leaf
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
those
of
the
willow
plum
and
ash
it
varies
materially
however
in
size
form
and
structure
from
them

border
of
the
true

more
regularly
serrated
the
serrations
stopping
just
short
of
the
stalk
and
the
venations
are
very
characteristic
in
the
genuine
tea
leaf
the
veins
running
out
from
the
almost
parallel
with
each
other
but
altering
their
course
before
the
border
of
the
leaf
is
reached
and
turning
so
as
to
leave
a
bare
space
just
under
it
so
that
in
making
an
examination
of
a
sample
of
tea
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
these
distinctive
characteristics
are
present
in
the
leaves
it
will
be
found
best
to
pour
boiling
water
on
to
soften
and
uncurl
them
and
spread
them
out
more
easily
on
the
glass

but
in
order
to
better
detect
the
presence
of
spurious
leaves
in
tea
a
better
knowledge
of
the
botanical
formation
of
the
true
tea
leaf
will
be
requisite
as
tea
leaves
in
general
bear
a
very
strong
resemblance
to
those
of
the
willow
plum
and
ash
but
vary
widely
in
size
and
texture
being
much
smaller
and
more
deeply
serrated
when
infused
and
unfolded
the
true
or
genuine
tea
leaf
is
of
a
color
the
looping
of
the
principal
veinings
being
also
very
characteristic
while
the
spurious
leaves
are
of
a
dark
color
and
very
irregular
in
form
when
examined
under
the
same
conditions
sand
and
other
mineral
substances
such
as
iron
and
steel
filings
are
also
frequently
introduced
into
tea
with
the
object
of
adding
to
its
weight
and
are
easiest
detected
by
powdering
a
small
quantity
of
the
leaves
and
spreading
the
powder
out
on
a
piece
of
glass
and
then
applying
an
ordinary
magnet
to
the
dust
so
that
if
a
quantity
of
the
particles
gravitate
and
adhere
to
the
magnet
the
tea
is
undoubtedly
adulterated
in
this
form
all
adulterations
and
fabrications
in
general
however
may
be
best
detected
by
the
following
simple
but
effectual
method
by
putting
a
small
sample
of
the
tea
leaves
in
a
or
thin
goblet
and
pouring
in
clear
cold
water
on
them
and
then
stirring
up
or
shaking
well
for
a
few
minutes
so
that
the
tea
if
pure
will
only
slightly
color
the
water
but
if
adulterated
in
any
form
a
dark
liquor
is
quickly
yielded
which
if
next
boiled
and
allowed
to
stand
until
cold
will
if
spurious
leaves
are
contained
become
very
bitter
to
the
taste
and
almost
transparent
as
it
cools
while
if
the
sample
is
composed
of
pure
tea
only
it
will
be
dark
in
color
and
pleasing
in
flavor
under
the
same
conditions
part
art
of
blending
teas
the
primary
object
and
fundamental
principle
of
successful
and
profitable
tea
blending
should
be
to
obtain
in
a
consolidated
form
what
is
known
as
harmony
of
combination
that
is
strength
pungency
flavor
and
piquancy
in
the
infusion
and
at
the
same
time
to
accomplish
this
result
with
the
smallest
possible
outlay
in
order
to
secure
this
end
three
important
rules
must
be
carefully
followed
to
learn
the
taste
of
the
consumer
to
ascertain
what
teas
will
combine
best
to
suit
this
taste
and
to
find
out
to
what
extent
the
component
parts
of
a
and
satisfactory
blend
may
be
varied
in
case
of
any
difficulty
to
secure
the
same
kind
or
grade
of
teas
for
future
use
these
essential
objects
can
be
best
attained
only
by
the
proper
selecting
weighing
and
arranging
of
the
proportionate
qualities
and
quantities
of
the
different
varieties
and
grades
of
tea
in
such
a
manner
as
to
secure
the
best
results
with
as
little
variation
as
possible
so
that
before
proceeding
to
produce
a
specific
blend
or
combination
the
dealer
must
consider
well
the
descriptions
of
tea
that
will
amalgamate
most
satisfactorily
as
well
as
those
that
will
not
unite
harmoniously
as
that
are
not
improved
by
combination
are
certain
to
be
deteriorated
in
the
whole
art
in
successful
tea
blending
being
to
combine
body
and
pungency
with
some
particular
and
distinct
flavor
in
one
in
order
to
please
a
majority
of
that
portion
of
the
public
for
whom
the
tea
is
specially
prepared
and
at
the
same
time
to
arrange
its
constituent
parts
in
such
a
manner
that
this
most
desirable
result
may
be
accomplished
at
a
moderate
cost
to
the
dealer
than
that
of
any
single
variety
and
again
to
learn
how
far
the
component
parts
may
be
varied
without
seriously
affecting
its
regularity
so
that
advantage
may
be
taken
of
the
cheapness
of
any
necessary
variety
or
grade
in
market
during
the
season
but
it
must
be
understood
at
the
outset
that
all
combinations
of
tea
as
a
rule
must
depend
upon
the
general
character
grade
and
flavor
of
the
tea
most
in
demand
in
the
particular
section
or
district
for
which
they
are
intended
that
special
variety
or
grade
forming
the
base
or
foundation
of
the
blends
prepared
for
it
that
is
it
must
dominate
the
combinations
as
for
instance
where
oolongs
are
most
in
demand
the
blend
must
consist
of
from
to
of
that
variety
and
so
on
with
congous
japans
india
and
ceylon
teas
as
the
case
may
be
uniformity
of
quality
and
flavor
in
tea
can
only
be
secured
by
intelligent
and
skillful
blending
so
that
the
advantages
to
be
gained
by
the
mixing
of
several
varieties
and
grades
of
tea
together
is
so
apparent
that
it
needs
no
arguments
to
sustain
them
but
as
only
the
most
expensive
teas
possess
in
any
marked
degree
the
best
qualities
which
go
to
make
a
thoroughly
satisfactory
beverage
when
used
alone
it
is
only
by
intelligent
blending
that
this
most
desirable
result
can
be
obtained
at
a
moderate
cost
to
the
dealer
again
it
is
the
dealer
who
understands
the
art
of
blending
his
teas
successfully
who
will
invariably
lead
his
competitors
in
the
the
taste
for
any
tea
being
an
acquired
and
not
a
natural
one
it
necessarily
follows
that
those
consumers
who
have
been
accustomed
to
a
certain
flavor
invariably
want
that
particular
flavor
again
and
so
will
be
displeased
with
any
other
tea
that
does
not
possess
it
although
it
may
be
much
higher
priced
and
better
in
every
way
users
of
wine
and
other
beverages
have
their
likes
and
dislikes
one
preferring
a
light
or
mild
and
another
a
strong
or
bitter
taste
and
so
it
is
with
most
tea
drinkers
when
once
they
have
acquired
a
preference
for
some
tea
this
being
a
fact
among
the
tea
trade
it
becomes
essential
for
the
successful
tea
blender
to
study
and
learn
what
particular
variety
grade
or
flavor
of
tea
his
patrons
have
been
accustomed
to
before
attempting
to
cater
to
it
as
not
only
is
there
a
more
divergence
in
the
taste
for
teas
in
the
different
parts
of
the
country
but
in
cities
towns
and
even
in
localities
the
specific
flavors
in
demand
are
so
numerous
and
various
that
most
of
the
leading
tea
dealers
have
been
enabled
to
mark
out
a
distinct
trade
for
themselves
in
large
cities
this
is
a
very
wise
and
desirable
policy
to
pursue
providing
the
blend
or
blends
adopted
and
found
satisfactory
are
kept
uniform
and
regular
thereafter
as
it
secures
the
return
again
and
again
of
the
same
customer
to
the
dealer
and
thus
keeps
his
tea
business
not
only
steady
but
progressive
even
away
from
the
large
cities
it
is
well
to
bear
the
importance
of
this
policy
in
mind
but
while
at
the
beginning
it
may
be
found
more
advisable
to
keep
fairly
close
to
the
established
taste
of
the
town
or
locality
a
gradual
change
by
the
introduction
of
some
special
combination
may
be
found
the
best
course
to
pursue
with
regard
to
the
best
teas
for
blending
purposes
before
proceeding
to
the
study
or
preparation
of
any
specific
formulas
it
will
be
well
for
the
dealer
to
consider
the
varieties
and
grades
of
tea
that
will
not
blend
satisfactorily
as
well
as
those
that
will
assimilate
successfully
with
each
other
in
this
case
it
is
much
easier
to
describe
the
negative
side
first
as
teas
that
will
not
be
improved
are
certain
to
be
injured
by
blending
one
of
the
best
rules
to
act
upon
as
a
guide
to
successful
tea
blending
is
not
to
allow
unclean
or
damaged
teas
even
in
the
smallest
quantities
to
be
introduced
into
any
blend
this
rule
should
be
as
rigidly
adhered
to
in
the
common
or
blends
as
in
the
choice
or
ones
because
never
for
a
moment
should
it
be
forgotten
by
the
dealer
that
if
not
improved
teas
are
certain
to
be
deteriorated
by
blending
particularly
by
the
introduction
of
inferior
teas
for
this
reason
it
may
be
well
for
him
to
consider
the
grade
of
tea
that
will
combine
satisfactorily
as
well
as
that
will
not
assimilate
successfully
with
each
other
as
even
though
all
the
other
teas
composing
a
blend
be
well
selected
and
well
arranged
the
presence
of
a
single
damaged
or
inferior
tea
will
be
found
to
taste
through
it
all
ankois
and
amoy
oolongs
described
by
the
trade
as
or
and
sometimes
as
teas
should
be
rejected
altogether
as
should
ever
so
small
a
quantity
of
these
weedy
ankois
be
introduced
into
a
blend
the
entire
combination
will
be
irretrievably
spoiled

tainted
or
otherwise
damaged
foochow

formosa

also
be
avoided

the
successful
as

they
are
introduced

from
any
blend
in
which
they
may
be
used
if
cheap
green
teas
must
be
had
for
blending
the
surest
policy
is
to
select
a
true
moyune
hyson
or
twankay
of
low
grade
for
the
purpose
as
the
commonest
kinds
of
the

will
give
better
satisfaction
in
any

the
finest

the
former

scented

subject

efforts

combinations
by
the
progressive
as
well
as
for
great
improvements
upon
those
that
are
presented
here
rules
for
successful
tea
blending
the
great
art
of
successful
tea
blending
consists
in
the
combining
of
quality
strength
pungency
with
some
particular
liquor
and
distinct
flavor
so
as
to
please
the
greatest
number
of
consumers
for
whom
the
blend
is
intended
and
at
the
same
time
to
arrange
the
component
parts
in
such
a
manner
that
this
result
may
be
attained
at
the
smallest
possible
cost
to
the
dealer
in
order
to
accomplish
this
object
three
important
points
are
necessary
the
dealer
must
study
to
understand
the
tastes
and
preferences
of
his
customers
for
whom
the
blend
is
to
be
prepared
he
must
learn
to
know
which
varieties
and
grades
of
tea
that
will
combine
best
to
please
this
taste
and
he
must
learn
to
know
how
far
the
component
parts
of
each
blend
can
be
varied
when
required
without
seriously
affecting
its
uniformity
so
that
he
may
be
the
better
enabled
to
take
advantage
of
the
cheapness
of
any
special
grade
of
tea
in
the
market
in
the
blending
of
china
congous
it
will
be
found
most
desirable
to
avoid
the
mixing
of
teas
of
a
heavy
strong
or
coarse
description
such
as
teas
of
the
padrae
and
saryune
sorts
with
those
of
a
highly
flavored
and
delicate
character
such
as
monings
and
chingwos
as
to
blend
teas
of
such
markedly
different
characters
will
be
found
beneficial
to
neither
this
rule
also
applies
to
formosa
oolongs
and
the
congou
sorts
as
the
briskness
of
the
lower
and
livelier
tea
is
marred
by
the
softness
of
the
more
delicate
and
flavory
tea
in
the
combination
while
the
body
of
the
former
will
be
spoiled
by
the
delicacy
of
the
latter
the
importance
of
retaining
all
blends
regular
and
uniform
when
once
they
have
been
adopted
and
proven
satisfactory
can
not
be
overestimated
as
what
tea
dealer
can
expect
continued
success
if
his
blends
consist
one
week
or
month
of
fine
flavory
teas
the
next
of
heavy
teas
and
the
third
of
a
sharp
pungent
or
astringent
character
each
new
combination
may
possess
good
qualities
of
its
own
all
its
component
parts
be
skillfully
and
judiciously
arranged
and
the
mixing
performed
with
the
greatest
care
but
unless
one
or
more
good
blends
is
decided
on
and
then
closely
adhered
to
complaints
will
be
made
by
the
customers
if
they
do
not
go
elsewhere
to
obtain
this
necessary
uniformity
is
sometimes
very
difficult
for
the
dealer
as
no
two
invoices
of
tea
will
be
found
exactly
alike
in
all
respects
and
although
teas
may
be
selected
of
about
the
same
grade
and
quality
even
chosen
from
those
grown
in
the
same
district
and
blended
in
exactly
the
same
proportions
as
in
the
combination
they
are
intended
to
replace
the
divergence
may
still
be
so
great
as
to
cause
dissatisfaction
among
the
customers
this
variation
may
best
be
avoided
by
not
changing
more
than
one
of
the
teas
composing
the
blend
at
the
same
time
so
that
when
a
number
of
teas
are
used
in
a
blend
the
alteration
of
any
one
of
them
providing
that
particular
one
is
fairly
matched
will
make
but
a
comparatively
small
difference
in
the
combination
if
the
changes
in
the
various
teas
forming
the
blend
are
thus
made
gradually
few
if
any
of
the
customers
will
detect
the
slight
alteration
in
the
blend
scoops
or
other
measures
must
not
be
relied
on
in
the
proper
blending
of
teas
and
weights
must
be
invariably
if
the
dealer
wants
to
be
precise
and
successful
in
the
business
for
if
it
is
worth
his
time
and
trouble
to
test
a
number
and
variety
of
teas
in
order
that
he
may
select
the
most
suitable
for
the
purpose
and
then
study
how
to
arrange
them
in
the
best
and
most
advantageous
proportions
it
certainly
is
worth
the
little
extra
time
and
trouble
of
not
marring
the
qualities
of
his
combinations
by
an
injudicious
and
muddling
of
the
quantities
of
the
various
parts
composing
the
blends
this
advantage
of
the
teas
for
blending
is
not
excelled
even
by
the
advantages
gained
by
the
careful
and
judicious
selection
of
the
teas
for
blending
purposes
all
teas
after
being
blended
should
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
caddie
or
bin
tightly
closed
for
from
a
week
to
ten
days
before
dispensing
in
order
that
the
different
teas
composing
the
blends
may
have
sufficient
time
to
assimilate
and
to
exchange
or
impart
their
opposite
flavors
to
each
other
for
should
they
not
be
allowed
to
thus
stand
and
the
tea
be
used
just
as
soon
as
the
blend
is
prepared
first
one
and
then
another
of
its
component
parts
will
predominate
in
too
great
a
proportion
by
which
the
time
and
trouble
that
has
been
taken
in
arranging
the
blend
will
have
been
to
a
large
extent
wasted
and
thrown
away
while
if
the
mixture
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
bin
or
caddie
as
directed
it
will
eventually
become
as
one
tea
and
be
always
regular
and
uniform
in
quality
and
flavor
good
clean
and
sweet
teas
being
nearly
always
to
be
had
for
a
few
cents
per
pound
above
the
price
of
the
cheap
trashy
teas
now
offered
on
the
american
market
it
is
only
folly
for
the
dealer
to
purchase
the
latter
as
they
are
not
cheap
at
any
price
as
by
the
supposed
saving
of
these
few
cents
in
the
pound
the
seed
is
not
only
sown
for
the
future
ruin
of
the
individual
dealer
but
it
also
disgusts
the
public
with
tea
as
an
article
of
food
while
on
the
other
hand
if
the
tea
dealer
will
make
a
comparatively
small
but
requisite
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
future
gain
complete
satisfaction
will
be
given
to
his
customers
the
trade
in
tea
will
be
fostered
and
increased
and
a
great
impetus
given
to
its
consumption
by
a
discriminating
public
a
blend
of
tea
should
never
have
its
cost
reduced
by
the
introduction
of
a
grade
coarser
in
nature
than
that
of
a
majority
of
the
teas
forming
the
combination
so
that
teas
when
used
for
reducing
the
cost
of
the
blend
should
be
as
full
plain
and
sweet
as
possible
this
is
advisable
for
the
reason
that
a
tea
of
such
a
pronounced
character
will
more
or
less
stamp
its
own
impression
upon
any
blend
into
which
it
may
be
introduced
again
should
the
tea
in
a
blend
be
a
tea
of
a
marked
or
inferior
character
instead
of
its
being
absorbed
by
the
other
teas
in
the
blend
its
disagreeable
features
will
stand
out
prominently
among
them
while
the
superior
qualities
of
the
finer
grades
will
be
if
not
entirely
obliterated
yet
so
injured
as
to
be
scarcely
recognizable
while
if
the
component
parts
of
the
blend
be
so
well
arranged
that
the
most
powerful
tea
constituting
it
be
also
the
highest
grade
tea
the
effect
produced
is
that
the
other
teas
in
it
are
raised
to
its
level
but
if
the
powerful
tea
is
one
of
the
teas
the
others
naturally
reduce
to
its
standard
early
picked
or
teas
should
always
be
chosen
when
possible
to
obtain
for
blending
purposes
as
teas
are
always
superior
to
the
later
pickings
in
flavor
and
aroma
in
the
greater
amount
of
the
active
principle
of
tea
which
they
contain
as
well
as
in
their
keeping
qualities
and
blending
properties
in
fact
in
everything
except
body
for
which
tea
is
deemed
valuable
but
in
addition
to
selecting
teas
for
blends
it
will
be
found
advisable
each
season
to
ascertain
the
district
yielding
the
best
product
thus
making
quality
as
well
as
quantity
the
test
of
success
for
as
with
wheat
and
other
crops
the
tea
crop
varies
considerably
according
to
the
season
some
years
it
is
very
good
in
one
province
or
district
while
in
others
it
may
prove
a
comparative
failure
thus
one
year
a
certain
crop
of
tea
may
be
heavy
and
strong
in
liquor
and
flavor
and
next
thin
weak
and
flavorless
while
other
that
have
been
lacking
in
these
qualities
last
year
may
possess
the
most
desirable
qualities
this
year
all
varieties
of
tea
are
equally
subject
to
these
variations
so
that
the
advantages
to
be
derived
from
a
careful
utilization
of
the
best
district
crops
of
the
year
with
but
slight
consideration
will
be
very
manifest
to
the
dealer
himself
the
tastes
in
tea
of
different
communities
varying
widely
the
dealer
should
study
and
learn
the
particular
kind
and
flavor
best
adapted
to
the
district
or
locality
in
which
he
is
doing
business
as
a
tea
that
may
suit
one
class
of
consumers
will
not
sell
at
all
in
another
so
that
the
dealer
himself
should
ascertain
by
repeated
trials
what
variety
or
grade
of
tea
best
suits
his
own
particular
trade
this
object
can
best
be
accomplished
by
a
series
of
experiments
with
the
numerous
kinds
of
tea
and
then
noting
and
adopting
the
character
and
flavor
of
the
tea
or
teas
that
gives
the
best
satisfaction
in
price
and
quality
to
a
majority
of
his
patrons
before
proceeding
to
give
formulas
for
any
specific
combinations
it
will
be
well
for
the
dealer
to
consider
the
varieties
and
grades
of
tea
that
will
not
blend
satisfactorily
as
well
as
those
which
will
assimilate
best
with
each
other
for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
for
a
moment
by
the
dealer
that
if
not
improved
is
certain
to
be
injured
by
but
it
is
much
easier
for
him
to
learn
what
teas
to
avoid
than
what
teas
to
select
and
what
are
best
adapted
to
his
particular
trade
generally
in
a
manufacturing
and
mining
district
or
among
all
working
classes
in
this
country
amoy
and
strong
foochow
oolongs
will
prove
the
most
popular
teas
for
the
base
or
foundation
of
all
blends
while
in
a
district
composed
chiefly
of
irish
english
or
scotch
tea
consumers
congous
souchongs
and
the
better
grades
of
india
and
ceylon
teas
will
be
found
to
give
the
best
satisfaction
in
neighborhoods
made
up
of
polish
and
russian
jews
congous
and
souchongs
or
combinations
of
these
two
varieties
alone
will
be
found
the
most
satisfactory
being
known
to
them
as
russian
teas
from
the
fact
that
these
are
the
only
sorts
used
among
russian
tea
drinkers
for
the
base
of
the
best
blends
or
for
flavoring
purposes
among
purely
american
tea
consumers
a
really
choice
formosa
oolong
will
be
found
an
exceedingly
valuable
tea
as
a
small
quantity
of
fine
or
even
tolerably
good
formosa
tea
will
permeate
and
taste
through
any
combination
and
most
tea
drinkers
when
once
they
become
accustomed
to
its
unique
flavor
will
rarely
be
pleased
with
any
other
tea
afterwards
the
dried
leaf
of
the
choicer
grades
is
small
and
artistically
made
in
color
while
the
infused
leaf
is
bright
green
and
uniform
the
liquor
is
of
a
rich
straw
color
its
value
consisting
in
a
combination
of
piquancy
pungency
and
delicate
aroma
to
successfully
accomplish
the
building
up
of
a
profitable
and
permanent
tea
business
three
things
are
requisite
the
dealer
must
keep
the
best
teas
obtainable
at
the
most
popular
prices
he
must
let
the
public
know
by
advertising
or
other
means
that
he
keeps
them
it
is
also
most
important
that
all
standard
blends
should
possess
some
distinct
or
characteristic
flavor
by
which
it
may
be
readily
recognized
by
those
who
use
it
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
very
little
use
in
advertising
or
making
known
a
tea
that
does
not
possess
intrinsic
merit
as
merit
without
some
publicity
makes
but
slow
headway
in
these
progressive
times
one
of
the
principal
objects
to
keep
in
view
in
forming
a
is
that
it
will
come
out
well
in
the
water
in
which
it
is
to
be
infused
that
it
shall
possess
a
flavor
that
will
please
the
taste
of
a
majority
of
the
customers
and
at
the
same
time
be
of
such
a
distinctive
character
as
to
make
the
combination
your
own
particular
specialty
but
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
teas
draw
quite
differently
in
hard
and
soft
water
and
the
object
should
be
to
offer
only
the
best
possible
tea
for
the
money
expended
he
should
also
avoid
those
kinds
which
are
unsuitable
to
the
water
of
his
locality
soft
water
has
a
great
advantage
over
hard
in
the
testing
and
preparation
of
tea
for
use
so
that
many
parts
of
the
country
possess
an
advantage
over
others
in
the
use
of
tea
as
wherever
the
water
is
soft
and
pure
far
better
results
are
obtained
from
an
infusion
of
a
given
quantity
of
leaves
than
can
be
produced
from
the
hard
water
of
other
sections
this
difference
arises
from
the
now
fact
that
soft
water
dissolves
a
greater
percentage
of
the
theine
the
active
principle
of
tea
than
hard
water
thus
causing
its
properties
to
become
more
apparent
the
coarseness
as
well
as
fineness
being
brought
out
to
a
greater
extent
by
the
action
of
the
soft
water
in
all
cases
and
consequently
the
too
and
teas
so
much
in
favor
in
some
sections
of
the
country
for
blends
are
not
liked
at
all
in
the
sections
where
soft
water
alone
is
to
be
had
for
this
reason
also
teas
of
the
congou
and
souchong
order
are
most
appreciated
where
the
water
is
soft
as
the
natural
delicacy
of
their
flavor
is
best
extracted
by
soft
water
and
in
even
greater
proportions
than
is
the
flavor
of
the
other
varieties
known
to
trade
in
testing
teas
by
infusion
or
drawing
for
blending
four
important
facts
must
be
borne
in
mind
by
the
dealer
water
used
for
drawing
them
should
be
as
soft
and
pure
as
can
be
obtained
or
filtered
before
must
be
boiled
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
used
only
at
the
boiling
point
must
be
boiling
but
must
not
for
should
it
be
allowed
to
overboil
for
even
a
few
minutes
it
will
not
extract
the
full
strength
and
aroma
from
the
leaves
all
tea
experts
are
most
particular
on
these
points
so
much
so
that
they
have
the
kettle
watched
in
order
that
the
water
may
be
poured
on
the
tea
the
moment
it
boils
and
if
any
water
remains
in
the
kettle
it
is
immediately
poured
away
as
the
effect
of
using
water
that
has
been
boiled
a
second
time
is
the
same
as
that
of
water
that
has
been
permitted
to
overboil
should
the
buyer
from
neglect
or
indifference
use
water
that
has
not
been
boiled
the
leaves
in
the
cup
will
float
on
top
and
not
sink
to
the
bottom
as
in
the
case
of
boiling
water
and
should
the
water
be
overboiled
or
boiled
a
second
time
it
will
be
readily
detected
by
its
appearance
in
the
cup
the
infusion
being
thin
and
insipid
and
of
a
peculiar
sickly
color
the
infusion
should
be
allowed
to
draw
from
four
to
six
minutes
according
to
the
variety
of
tea
under
treatment
that
is
china
and
japan
teas
five
to
six
minutes
while
india
ceylon
and
java
teas
require
only
three
to
four
minutes
owing
to
the
great
excess
of
tannin
which
they
contain
but
all
the
properties
of
the
tea
that
can
be
dissolved
in
the
cup
is
fully
extracted
in
from
three
to
four
minutes
five
to
six
minutes
being
generally
sufficient
for
all
teas
as
the
infusion
is
then
at
its
best
but
from
that
time
on
the
tea
gradually
loses
its
aroma
and
flavor
until
if
allowed
to
stand
for
half
an
hour
it
becomes
dull
and
insipid
another
important
point
must
here
be
noted
by
the
dealer
it
is
that
a
good
tea
becomes
better
as
it
cools
while
a
poor
tea
becomes
poorer
under
the
same
conditions
the
leaves
of
a
choice
pure
tea
will
be
found
after
infusion
to
be
of
a
medium
and
uniform
size
perfectly
formed
and
unbroken
and
of
a
or
according
to
the
kind
of
tea
tested
that
is
oolongs
green
and
japan
teas
will
be
greenish
while
congous
souchongs
india
ceylon
and
java
teas
will
be
in
color
all
teas
of
the
oolong
varieties
are
subject
to
the
same
rules
in
judging
them
and
the
same
rules
that
govern
in
testing
green
teas
will
also
apply
to
japans
while
the
selection
of
indias
ceylons
and
teas
of
the
sorts
are
also
governed
by
similar
rules
in
testing
and
selecting
still
another
important
point
for
the
dealer
to
keep
in
mind
is
the
necessity
of
securing
teas
that
will
draw
well
in
the
water
of
his
district
to
aid
in
this
selection
the
following
kinds
are
suggested
very
hard
padrae
saryune
and
strong
oonfa
congous
are
best
also
indias
of
the
assam
variety
and
ceylons
including
pekoes
are
best
adapted

including

of
all

of
nearly
all
kinds
as
well
as
all
descriptions
of
teas
part
vi
art
of
keeping
selling
and
preparing
tea
the
utmost
care
is
necessary
in
the
keeping
and
handling
of
tea
in
order
to
prevent
from
deteriorating
in
strength
and
flavor
or
otherwise
decaying
until
disposed
of
it
should
therefore
whenever
possible
be
kept
by
itself
in
a
moderately
warm
temperature
and
always
covered
over
until
required
and
when
any
of
the
packages
have
been
opened
and
the
contents
not
all
removed
care
must
be
taken
to
replace
the
lead
lining
lid
and
matting
so
as
to
exclude
the
dust
and
damp
as
well
as
all
foreign
odors
that
may
surround
it
for
this
reason
also
tea
should
never
be
exposed
in
windows
or
at
where
the
air
damp
and
dust
surely
and
rapidly
destroy
all
semblance
to
its
original
condition
all
teas
when
once
they
have
ripened
and
become
seasoned
commence
to
decay
but
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
the
time
that
some
varieties
will
last
before
the
deterioration
becomes
objectionable
in
comparison
with
others
some
kinds
such
as
foochow
and
formosa
oolongs
keeping
for
a
year
or
more
china
congous
and
souchongs
and
japan
teas
from
six
to
eight
months
while
scented
teas
india
and
ceylon
teas
after
a
much
briefer
period
become
dull
and
brackish
and
it
frequently
happens
that
when
the
latter
are
a
year
old
they
are
worth
only
half
their
original
cost
all
teas
possessing
a
natural
aptitude
to
become
impregnated
with
foreign
flavor
of
any
product
placed
near
it
and
to
absorb
the
foul
odors
by
which
they
may
be
surrounded
should
be
kept
as
far
apart
as
possible
from
any
articles
in
the
stock
such
as
soap
fish
spices
and
oils
of
all
kinds
as
they
very
rapidly
absorb
any
pungent
odors
that
may
be
in
their
immediate
vicinity
and
teas
have
even
been
known
to
completely
alter
their
flavor
and
character
by
being
placed
too
close
to
molasses
oranges
and
lemons
therefore
it
becomes
important
for
the
dealer
not
to
keep
teas
too
near
any
product
emitting
a
foul
or
strong
aroma
for
this
reason
also
they
should
not
be
dispensed
out
of
bins
or
caddies
it
being
much
more
preferable
at
all
times
to
deal
them
out
of
the
original
chests
replacing
the
lid
until
required
again
teas
should
never
be
mixed
in
rainy
damp
or
humid
weather
as
they
are
bound
to
absorb
and
be
injured
by
the
oxydizing
influences
of
the
atmosphere
nor
must
they
be
kept
too
near
a
fire
or
stove
a
dry
cool
atmosphere
of
moderate
temperature
being
always
best
for
them
of
the
numerous
commodities
dealt
in
by
the
grocer
there
is
none
so
important
as
that
of
tea
this
importance
being
due
to
its
value
as
a
and
article
particularly
when
furnished
of
such
quality
as
to
give
permanent
satisfaction
to
the
general
public
as
well
as
to
the
regular
customer
but
notwithstanding
its
importance
in
these
respects
there
is
no
article
handled
by
the
grocer
the
quality
and
value
of
which
is
so
little
understood
by
the
average
dealer
again
assailed
as
the
retail
grocery
business
now
is
by
keen
competition
from
so
many
queer
teas
the
necessity
for
a
better
knowledge
of
and
more
careful
attention
to
the
article
is
at
once
apparent
if
the
grocer
to
whom
its
sale
of
right
belongs
is
not
to
find
the
almost
entire
withdrawal
of
this
article
from
his
line
of
business
to
properly
understand
the
selecting
and
blending
of
teas
is
therefore
to
be
possessed
of
a
valuable
and
profitable
knowledge
but
while
such
proficiency
is
not
within
the
scope
of
every
dealer
the
study
of
these
points
to
any
extent
will
prove
not
only
lucrative
but
entertaining
and
instructive
and
while
it
may
be
claimed
that
such
a
study
will
occupy
too
much
valuable
time
or
that
it
is
much
more
economical
to
purchase
from
the
wholesale
tea
blender
still
the
great
importance
of
a
better
acquaintance
with
such
knowledge
and
experience
must
be
evident
to
the
dealer
for
the
proper
blending
of
tea
the
dealer
should
be
provided
with
a
small
kettle
and
other
apparatus
for
filtering
and
boiling
the
water
as
conveniently
and
rapidly
as
possible
small
scales
for
weighing
the
samples
of
tea
to
be
tested
pots
for
drawing
and
cups
for
tasting
and
so
start
from
the
beginning
samples
of
the
teas
desired
having
been
procured
from
different
houses
should
then
be
drawn
and
tested
and
a
careful
examination
made
of
the
leaves
of
each
their
size
color
condition
and
smell
being
closely
noted
in
such
drawings
all
teas
of
an
objectionable
character
should
be
set
aside
and
those
remaining
on
the
boards
carefully
arranged
in
the
order
of
their
value
but
should
any
doubt
exist
in
giving
a
decision
between
the
several
samples
as
to
their
superiority
then
the
drawing
should
be
repeated
and
the
poorer
ones
rejected
thus
narrowing
down
the
contest
to
the
best
teas
again
where
it
proves
difficult
to
decide
between
the
cup
qualities
of
those
remaining
then
the
size
style
condition
and
weight
of
the
dry
leaf
should
be
taken
into
consideration
which
will
be
found
helpful
in
making
the
required
decision
the
decision
having
been
arrived
at
however
the
tea
considered
best
may
also
be
higher
in
price
than
some
others
approximating
to
it
in
style
and
drawing
qualities
and
if
it
be
found
that
it
can
not
be
purchased
except
at
a
price
considerably
higher
than
others
on
the
table
approaching
it
closely
it
will
be
better
under
such
circumstances
to
select
another
tea
grading
second
or
even
third
in
quality
at
a
much
lower
figure
an
excellent
plan
for
the
careful
tea
blender
is
to
have
a
or
standard
sample
of
the
tea
he
desires
to
duplicate
and
which
he
has
found
to
be
satisfactory
and
samples
of
tea
of
the
various
kinds
of
known
value
should
always
be
kept

reference

the
next
most
important
consideration
for
him
is
how
best
to
bring
them
before
the
notice
of
his
trade
and
the
public
generally
in
this
case
he
must
not
treat
his
tea
as
a
article
but
as
an
entirely
new
commodity
requiring
a
special
effort
for
its
introduction
nothing
gives
such
a
bad
impression
to
tea
customers
as
careless

slovenly

all
tea
bags
should
be

and
great

should
be
taken
to
obtain

also
have

special

for
his

wrappers
should
contain
special
notices
so
that
they
may
reach
others
who
do
not
buy
tea
and
the
clerks
or
salesmen
should
also
be
instructed
to
talk
up
the
tea
frequently
but
judiciously
as
possible
the
dealer
should
ascertain
where
customers
for
other
goods
get
their
tea
what
variety
or
grade
it
is
what
price
they
pay
for
it
and
if
possible
obtain
a
sample
of
it
then
test
it
carefully
and
be
prepared
to
show
that
he
can
not
only
match
it
but
furnish
a
better
one
in
both
price
and
quality
giving
them
samples
at
the
same
time
to
prove
it
and
again
if
a
tea
customer
should
quit
dealing
suddenly
he
should
immediately
find
out
the
cause
and
endeavor
to
remedy
it
he
should
also
send
out
samples
occasionally
throughout
the
neighborhood
of
a
line
of
teas
that
he
may
deem
suitable
to
the
locality
but
above
and
beyond
all
other
efforts
to
increase
his
tea
trade
he
should
handle
only
teas
endeavoring
at
all
times
to
prove
that
the
finer
teas
are
the
most
economical
and
satisfactory
to
purchase
in
the
end
as
the
finer
grades
yield
a
larger
margin
of
profit
to
the
dealer
and
better
satisfaction
to
the
consumer
while
it
has
a
tendency
to
create
favorable
comment
and
win
an
increasing
tea
trade
latterly
a
new
development
in
the
tea
trade
has
to
the
surprise
and
loss
of
the
older
generation
of
retail
grocers
and
tea
dealers
assumed
quite
a
prominence
for
if
the
glowing
advertisements
and
startling
placards
in
stores
and
on
fences
form
any
criterion
the
public
are
taking
a
liking
to
the
cheap
and
teas
put
up
in
tins
lead
paper
and
other
packages
under
fancy
names
which
have
no
relation
whatever
to
the
variety
district
or
country
where
they
are
grown
it
being
an
acknowledged
principle
that
teas
blended
in
bulk
and
put
back
again
in
their
original
chests
undoubtedly
keep
better
preserving
its
strength
and
flavor
longer
than
when
exposed
to
the
oxydizing
influences
of
the
atmosphere
during
its
transference
to
the
tin
lead
or
paper
packets
ornamented
with
a
cheap
and
showy
label
which
the
more
gorgeous
they
are
the
more
apt
to
communicate
the
taste
of
the
ink
paste
glue
or
other
material
in
which
it
is
packed
to
the
tea
they
are
intended
to
adorn
and
still
another
reason
why
the
grocer
and
tea
dealer
should
avoid
these
blended
packet
teas
is
that
the
cost
of
the
packages
labels
and
labor
adds
from
eight
to
ten
cents
per
pound
to
the
original
price
of
the
tea
in
addition
to
the
cost
of
advertising
and
flaunting
them
before
the
eyes
of
the
public
an
expense
which
is
simply
enormous
in
itself
and
which
the
dealer
and
consumer
must
eventually
pay
for
either
by
a
higher
price
or
inferior
quality
of
the
tea
again
engaged
as
most
dealers
are
at
the
present
time
in
trying
to
stop
the
plague
of
all
sorts
of
proprietary
goods
put
up
in
cheap
and
oftentimes
packages
which
yields
them
so
little
profit
and
makes
them
only
the
servants
of
the
packers
it
is
astonishing
to
say
the
least
that
any
dealer
can
be
found
to
adopt
the
same
system
with
tea
when
they
can
put
up
some
favorite
blend
and
pack
it
themselves
in
cleaner
cheaper
and
more
stylish
packages
if
their
customers
should
desire
it
in
that
form
and
sell
them
under
their
own
brand
and
name
and
not
work
to
make
money
and
a
reputation
for
others
who
dictate
to
him
as
to
what
he
shall
or
shall
not
do
with
regard
to
selling
teas
for
instance
you
are
paying
cents
for
package
tea
with
premiums
if
you
handle
it
you
sell
this
tea
at
cents
making
cents
per
pound
profit
now
by
putting
up

the
art
of
selling
tea
is
even
a
much
more
difficult
one
than
that
of
buying
owing
to
the
numerous
different
and
varying
tastes
to
be
catered
to
for
this
reason
alone
the
dealer
should
learn
all
he
possibly
can
about
the
article
in
order
that
he
may
be
enabled
to
suit
each
particular
liking
and
at
the
same
time
answer
any
and
all
questions
about
it
intelligently
find
out
what
grade
and
variety
as
well
as
the
desired
strength
and
flavor
of
the
tea
your
customers
prefer
and
occasionally
give
them
small
samples
of
the
different
blends
to
try
until
you
have
caught
their
taste
make
a
note
of
same
and
always
afterwards
endeavor
to
give
them
as
near
the
same
kind
and
quality
talk
up
your
teas
in
a
clear
and
practical
manner
and
be
sure
your
scales
weights
and
scoops
are
always
clean
and
shining
and
keep
a
small
memorandum
book
in
which
to
mark
the
kind
and
retail
prices
of
your
teas
the
date
in
which
the
caddie
has
been
filled
and
the
quantity
it
holds
as
this
method
gives
an
accurate
idea
of
the
quantity
of
tea
sold
in
a
certain
time
which
will
be
found
particularly
useful
when
blended
teas
are
largely
sold
in
brief
advertise
your
teas
freely
but
judiciously
and
modestly
never
claiming
too
much
for
them
that
is
let
your
advertisements
be
brief
but
novel
and
change
the
same
at
least
once
per
week
and
always
push
your
teas
first
last
and
all
the
time
now
and
then
give
a
exhibit
in
your
store
by
fixing
up
a
space
near
the
door
or
window
as
a
surrounded
by
with
fancy
faces
hanging
some
chinese
or
japanese
lanterns
around
with
which
to
light
up
at
night
to
attract
attention
inside
of
which
place
a
small
a
small
gas
stove
with
kettle
and
cups
for
drawing
the
tea
by
this
means
the
dealer
will
be
enabled
to
prepare
tea
at
all
times
with
water
of
any
kind
the
customer
may
desire
to
taste
or
to
push
the
sale
of
any
particular
blend
he
may
desire
to
introduce
among
his
trade
but
it
is
advisable
at
these
exhibits
to
use
only
fine
teas
using
the
common
grades
only
by
way
of
comparison
by
this
means
the
dealer
can
conveniently
and
readily
point
out
to
the
customer
the
great
advantages
to
be
gained
and
economy
of
purchasing
only
teas
instruct
your
patrons
meantime
how
to
properly
prepare
tea
for
use
emphasizing
the
fact
that
tea
must
be
and
not
stewed
as
is
too
often
the
case
among
consumers
art
of
preparing
tea
for
use
it
is
singular
to
say
the
least
that
nothing
is
ever
done
by
tea
dealers
in
this
country
to
educate
or
enlighten
their
customers
in
the
proper
manner
of
preparing
their
tea
for
use
to
study
the
character
of
the
water
or
to
preserve
its
aromatic
properties
after
purchasing
good
tea
like
good
wine
can
be
kept
intact
for
years
with
considerable
advantage
to
the
dealer
and
consumer
alike
and
there
is
no
valid
reason
why
consumers
of
tea
should
not
be
as
particular
and
fastidious
as
drinkers
of
wine
but
to
obtain
a
good
cup
of
tea
in
the
first
place
the
consumer
should
purchase
only
the
best
tea
it
requiring
much
less
of
the
finer
grades
to
make
good
tea
than
of
the
common
kinds
and
will
prove
the
most
economical
in
the
end
in
the
proper
preparation
of
tea
for
use
the
quality
of
the
infusion
is
much
affected
also
by
the
character
of
the
water
as
well
as
by
the
method
of
making
or
drawing
it
tea
being
an
and
not
a
like
coffee
it
should
be
not
the
chief
object
being
to
extract
as
much
of
the
or
refreshing
principle
as
possible
and
as
little
of
the
or
astringent
property
as
can
be
at
the
same
time
without
either
boiling
or
overdrawing
it
many
tea
drinkers
who
imagine
erroneously
that
a
very
liquor
indicates
strength
boil
the
leaves
while
others
again
spoil
the
infusion
by
first
putting
the
leaves
in
boiling
water
some
again
place
the
leaves
in
cold
water
and
then
put
it
the
vessel
on
the
fire
to
boil
prolonged
infusion
being
another
serious
mistake
all
of
these
improper
methods
produce
the
same
evil
results
that
of
extracting
an
increased
amount
of
the
tannin
thereby
destroying
the
true
color
and
flavor
of
the
tea
by
imparting
a
blackish
color
and
giving
a
bitter
or
astringent
taste
to
the
liquor
when
tea
has
been
once
boiled
or
overdrawn
the
increased
quantity
of
tannin
extracted
can
be
readily
detected
by
the
extreme
dark
color
of
the
liquor
as
well
as
by
its
bitterly
astringent
flavor
another
reprehensible
practice
of
some
tea
makers
is
that
of
adding
fresh
leaves
into
the
tea
pot
with
those
that
have
been
already
once
drawn
as
it
can
not
add
to
either
the
strength
or
flavor
of
the
tea
by
putting
more
leaves
in
the
tea
pot
after
the
first
drawing
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
tea
water
will
not
extract
the
from
the
dry
leaves
of
the
fresh
tea
fresh
boiling
water
will
do
this
the
water
once
used
only
increases
the
of
extracted
thereby
darkening
the
color
and
destroying
the
flavor
and
merely
adds
to
the
quantity
of
leaves
already
in
the
vessel
without
at
all
affecting
the
active
principle
theine
so
that
if
it
be
required
to
increase
the
quantity
or
strength
of
the
infusion
already
in
the
pot
some
fresh
tea
leaves
must
be
drawn
in
a
separate
vessel
and
the
liquor
poured
in
that
already
made
in
the
proper
preparation
of
tea
for
use
therefore
the
object
should
be
to
extract
as
little
of
the
tannin
as
possible
and
as
much
of
the
theine
and
volatile
oil
as
can
be
extracted
without
permitting
the
infusion
to
boil
or
overdraw
to
best
obtain
these
most
desirable
results
put
the
requisite
quantity
of
tea
leaves
in
a
covered
china
or
earthenware
pot
all
tin
and
metal
vessels
should
be
avoided
and
pour
in
freshly
boiling
water
that
has
been
boiling
for
at
least
three
minutes
and
then
allow
the
vessel
to
stand
where
it
will
keep
hot
without
for
from
eight
to
ten
minutes
before
serving
according
to
the
variety
of
tea
used
there
will
be
a
sparkle
and
aroma
about
tea
made
from
fresh
boiling
water
in
this
manner
that
it
will
not
receive
from
the
flat
hot
water
that
has
been
boiled
too
long
or
repeatedly
in
the
stated
time
while
the
tea
is
drawing
only
the
refreshing
and
exhilarating
properties
the
theine
and
volatile
oil
are
extracted
from
the
leaves
a
longer
infusion
only
dissolving
and
extracting
the
astringent
and
deleterious
principle
tannic
acid
which
impairs
digestion
and
injures
the
nervous
system
for
which
causes
alone
all
boiled
or
overdrawn
tea
should
be
avoided
an
earthern
tea
pot
made
of
minton
doulton
or
satsuma
ware
is
the
best
kind
of
vessel
to
prepare
tea
in
but
it
must
first
be
scalded
out
with
boiling
water
before
putting
the
tea
leaves
in
and
then
set
on
the
range
or
stove
to
dry
and
keep
hot
for
a
few
minutes
the
tea
leaves
are
then
put
in
after
which
they
are
also
allowed
to
heat
for
a
short
time
before
the
boiling
water
is
poured
on
them
from
eight
to
ten
minutes
before
the
tea
is
required
for
use
the
character
of
the
water
also
greatly
influences
the
quality
of
the
tea
it
being
almost
next
to
impossible
to
make
good
tea
with
hard
water
so
that
soft
water
should
always
be
used
when
available
and
any
excess
of
lime
in
the
water
also
deteriorates
the
infusion
but
this
latter
difficulty
may
be
easily
remedied
by
the
judicious
addition
of
a
little
carbonate
of
soda
as
much
as
will
cover
the
face
of
a
dime
being
sufficient
for
an
ordinary
drawing
of
tea
in
moderate
strength
it
requires
about
one
teaspoonful
of
good
tea
to
a
half
pint
of
boiling
water
and
an
ordinary
half
teacupful
of
leaves
to
every
quart
of
boiling
water
the
latter
making
a
fairly
strong
infusion
for
five
persons
china
and
japan
teas
require
from
eight
to
ten
minutes
to
draw
thoroughly
the
former
requiring
but
little
milk
and
sugar
while
japan
teas
are
more
palatable
without
the
addition
of
either
india
ceylon
and
java
teas
generally
should
not
be
allowed
to
draw
more
than
from
five
to
seven
minutes
at
the
outside
after
the
boiling
water
has
been
poured
on
as
prolonged
infusion
makes
the
flavor
of
these
varieties
particularly
mawkish
and
bitter
while
the
addition
of
an
extra
quantity
of
both
milk
and
sugar
greatly
improves
their
drinking
qualities
