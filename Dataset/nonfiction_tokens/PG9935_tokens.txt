cookery
consists
of
five
volumes
that
cover
the
various
phases
of
the
subject

course
in
cookery
arranged
so
that
related
subjects
are
grouped
together
examination
questions
pertaining
to
the
subject
matter
appear
at
the
end
of
each
section
these
questions
will
prove
helpful
in
a
mastery
of
the
subjects
to

they
relate
as
they
are
the

as
those
on
which
students
of
the
institute
are
required
to
report
at
the
back
of
each
volume
is

essentials

part
the
problem
of
food
without
doubt
the
greatest
problem
confronting
the
human
race
is
that
of
food
in
order
to
exist
every
person
must
eat
but
eating
simply
to
keep
life
in
the
body
is
not
enough
aside
from
this
the
body
must
be
supplied
with
an
ample
amount
of
energy
to
carry
on
each
work
as
well
as
with
the
material
needed
for
its
growth
repair
and
working
power
to
meet
these
requirements
of
the
human
body
there
is
nothing
to
take
the
place
of
not
merely
any
kind
however
but
the
kind
indeed
so
important
is
the
right
kind
of
food
in
the
scheme
of
life
that
the
child
deprived
of
it
neither
grows
nor
increases
in
weight
and
the
adult
who
is
unable
to
secure
enough
of
it
for
adequate
nourishment
is
deficient
in
nerve
force
and
working
power
if
a
person
is
to
get
the
best
out
of
life
the
food
taken
into
the
body
must
possess
real
sustaining
power
and
supply
the
tissues
with
the
necessary
building
material
and
this
truth
points
out
that
there
are
facts
and
principles
that
must
be
known
in
order
that
the
proper
selection
of
food
may
be
made
that
it
may
be
so
prepared
as
to
increase
its
value
and
that
economy
in
its
selection
preparation
use
and
care
may
be
exercised
probably
the
most
important
of
these
principles
is
the
of
while
this
refers
especially
to
the
preparation
of
food
by
subjecting
edible
materials
to
the
action
of
heat
it
involves
much
more
the
cooking
of
food
is
a
science
as
well
as
an
art
and
it
depends
for
its
success
on
known
and
established
principles
in
its
full
sense
means
not
only
the
ability
to
follow
a
recipe
thereby
producing
a
successfully
cooked
dish
but
also
the
ability
to
select
materials
a
knowledge
of
the
ways
in
which
to
prepare
them
an
understanding
of
their
value
for
the
persons
for
whom
they
are
prepared
and
ingenuity
in
serving
foods
attractively
and
in
making
the
best
use
of
food
that
may
be
left
over
from
the
previous
meals
so
that
there
will
be
practically
no
waste
thus
while
cookery
in
all
its
phases
is
a
broad
subject
it
is
one
that
truly
belongs
to
woman
not
only
because
of
the
pleasure
she
derives
in
preparing
food
for
the
members
of
her
family
but
because
she
is
particularly
qualified
to
carry
on
the
work
the
providing
of
food
in
the
home
is
a
matter
that
usually
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
housewife
in
fact
on
her
depends
the
wise
use
of
the
family
income
this
means
then
that
whether
a
woman
is
earning
her
own
livelihood
and
has
only
herself
to
provide
for
or
whether
she
is
spending
a
part
of
some
other
person
income
as
for
instance
her
father
or
her
husband
she
should
understand
how
to
proportion
her
money
so
as
to
provide
the
essential
needs
namely
food
clothing
and
shelter
in
considering
the
question
of
providing
food
the
housewife
should
set
about
to
determine
what
three
meals
a
day
will
cost
and
in
this
matter
she
should
be
guided
by
the
thought
that
the
meals
must
be
the
best
that
can
possibly
be
purchased
for
the
amount
of
money
allowed
for
food
from
the
family
income
and
that
their
cost
must
not
exceed
the
allotment
to
a
great
extent
she
can
control
the
cost
of
her
foods
by
selecting
them
with
care
and
then
making
good
use
of
what
her
money
has
bought
it
is
only
by
constant
thought
and
careful
planning
however
that
she
will
be
able
to
keep
within
her
means
and
she
will
find
that
her
greatest
assistance
lies
in
studying
foods
and
the
ways
in
which
to
prepare
them
a
factor
that
should
not
be
disregarded
in
the
problem
of
food
is
and
so
that
the
housewife
can
cope
with
it
properly
she
should
understand
the
distinction
between
waste
and
refuse
these
terms
are
thought
by
some
to
mean
the
same
thing
and
are
often
confused
but
there
is
a
decided
difference
between
them
as
applied
to
food
is
something
that
could
be
used
but
is
not
whereas
is
something
that
is
rejected
because
it
is
unfit
for
use
for
example
the
fat
of
meat
which
is
often
eaten
is
waste
if
it
is
thrown
away
but
potato
parings
which
are
not
suitable
as
food
are
refuse
in
connection
with
the
problem
of
waste
it
may
be
well
to
know
that
leakage
in
the
household
is
due
to
three
causes
the
first
one
is
lack
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
housekeeper
as
to
the
difference
between
waste
and
refuse
and
a
consequent
failure
to
market
well
as
an
illustration
many
housewives
will
reject
turkey
at
a
certain
price
a
pound
as
being
too
expensive
and
instead
will
buy
chicken
at
say
cents
a
pound
less
in
reality
chicken
at
cents
a
pound
less
than
the
price
of
turkey
is
more
expensive
because
turkey
whose
proportion
of
meat
to
bone
is
greater
than
that
of
chicken
furnishes
more
edible
material
therefore
in
buying
chicken
they
pay
more
for
refuse
in
proportion
to
good
material
the
second
cause
for
this
leakage
in
the
household
is
excessive
waste
in
the
preparation
of
food
for
the
table
arising
from
the
selection
of
the
wrong
cooking
method
or
the
lack
of
skill
in
cooking
and
the
third
cause
is
the
serving
of
too
large
quantities
and
a
consequent
waste
of
food
left
on
individual
plates
and
unfit
for
any
other
use
in
the
home
another
matter
that
constantly
confronts
the
housewife
is
what
foods
she
shall
select
for
each
day
meals
to
be
successful
all
meals
should
be
planned
with
the
idea
of
making
them
wholesome
and
appetizing
giving
them
variety
and
using
the
every
woman
should
understand
that
food
is
cooked
for
both
hygienic
and
esthetic
reasons
that
is
it
must
be
made
safe
and
wholesome
for
health
sake
and
must
satisfy
the
appetite
which
to
a
considerable
degree
is
mental
and
of
course
is
influenced
by
the
appearance
of
the
food
when
the
housewife
knows
how
to
cook
ordinary
foods
well
she
has
an
excellent
foundation
from
which
to
obtain
variety
in
the
by
which
in
these
lessons
is
meant
the
daily
food
and
drink
of
any
individual
and
not
something
prescribed
by
a
physician
for
a
person
who
is
ill
for
then
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
putting
a
little
careful
thought
into
the
work
she
is
doing
in
order
to
get
ideas
of
new
ways
in
which
to
prepare
these
same
foods
and
of
utilizing
foodstuffs
she
has
on
hand
however
ample
time
must
always
be
allowed
for
the
preparation
of
meals
for
no
one
can
expect
to
produce
tasty
meals
by
rushing
into
the
kitchen
just
before
meal
time
and
getting
up
the
easiest
thing
in
the
quickest
manner
meals
carefully
prepared
will
stimulate
interest
in
the
next
day
bill
of
fare
and
will
prove
extremely
beneficial
to
all
concerned
in
the
practice
of
cookery
it
is
also
important
that
the
meals
be
planned
and
the
cooking
done
for
the
sake
of
building
the
human
body
and
caring
for
it
as
soon
as
any
woman
realizes
that
both
the
present
and
the
future
welfare
of
the
persons
for
whom
she
is
providing
foods
depend
on
so
many
things
that
are
included
in
cookery
her
interest
in
this
branch
of
domestic
science
will
increase
and
in
making
a
study
of
it
she
may
rest
assured
that
there
is
possibly
no
other
calling
that
affords
a
more
constant
source
of
enjoyment
and
a
better
opportunity
for
acquiring
knowledge
displaying
skill
and
helping
others
to
be
well
and
happy
the
fact
that
people
constantly
desire
something
new
and
different
in
the
way
of
food
offers
the
housewife
a
chance
to
develop
her
ingenuity
along
this
line
then
too
each
season
brings
with
it
special
foods
for
enjoyment
and
nourishment
and
there
is
constant
satisfaction
in
providing
the
family
with
some
surprise
in
the
form
of
a
dish
to
which
they
are
unaccustomed
or
an
old
one
prepared
in
a
new
or
a
better
way
but
the
pleasure
need
not
be
for
the
adding
of
some
new
touch
to
each
meal
will
give
as
much
delight
to
the
one
who
prepares
the
food
as
to
those
who
partake
of
it
when
cookery
is
thought
of
in
this
way
it
is
really
a
creative
art
and
has
for
its
object
something
more
than
the
making
of
a
single
dish
or
the
planning
of
a
single
meal
from
what
has
been
pointed
out
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
a
correct
knowledge
of
cookery
and
all
that
it
implies
is
of
extreme
importance
to
those
who
must
prepare
food
for
others
indeed
it
is
for
just
such
persons
the
housewife
who
must
solve
cookery
problems
from
day
to
day
as
well
as
girls
and
women
who
must
prepare
themselves
to
perform
the
duties
with
which
they
will
be
confronted
when
they
take
up
the
management
of
a
household
and
its
affairs
that
these
lessons
in
cookery
are
intended
in
the
beginning
of
this
course
of
study
in
cookery
it
is
deemed
advisable
to
call
attention
to
the
order
in
which
the
subject
matter
is
presented
as
will
be
seen
before
much
progress
is
made
the
lessons
are
arranged
progressively
that
is
the
instruction
begins
with
the
essentials
or
important
fundamentals
of
food
its
selection
preparation
and
care
and
from
these
as
a
foundation
advances
step
by
step
into
the
more
complicated
matters
and
minor
details
the
beginner
eager
to
take
up
the
actual
work
of
cookery
may
feel
that
too
much
attention
is
given
to
preliminaries
however
these
are
extremely
essential
for
they
are
the
groundwork
on
which
the
actual
cooking
of
food
depends
indeed
without
a
knowledge
of
them
very
little
concerning
cookery
in
its
various
phases
could
be
readily
comprehended
each
beginner
in
cookery
is
therefore
urged
to
master
every
lesson
in
the
order
in
which
she
receives
it
and
to
carry
out
diligently
every
detail
no
lesson
should
be
disregarded
as
soon
as
it
is
understood
for
the
instruction
given
in
it
bears
a
close
relation
to
the
entire
subject
and
should
be
continually
put
into
practice
as
progress
is
made
this
thought
applies
with
particular
emphasis
to
the
sections
relating
to
the
essentials
of
cookery
these
should
be
used
in
connection
with
all
other
sections
as
books
of
reference
and
an
aid
in
calling
to
mind
points
that
must
eventually
become
a
part
of
a
woman
cookery
knowledge
by
carrying
on
her
studies
systematically
and
following
directions
carefully
the
beginner
will
find
the
cooking
of
foods
a
simple
matter
and
will
take
delight
in
putting
into
practice
the
many
things
that
she
learns
selection
of
food
matters
involved
in
right
selection
each
one
of
the
phases
of
cookery
has
its
importance
but
if
success
is
to
be
achieved
in
this
art
careful
attention
must
be
given
to
the
selection
of
what
is
to
be
cooked
so
as
to
determine
its
value
and
suitability
to
insure
the
best
selection
therefore
the
housewife
should
decide
whether
the
food
material
she
purchases
will
fit
the
needs
of
the
persons
who
are
to
eat
it
whether
the
amount
of
labor
involved
in
the
preparation
will
be
too
great
in
proportion
to
the
results
obtained
whether
the
loss
in
preparation
that
is
the
proportion
of
refuse
to
edible
matter
will
be
sufficient
to
affect
the
cost
materially
what
the
approximate
loss
in
cooking
will
be
whether
the
food
will
serve
to
the
best
advantage
after
it
is
cooked
and
finally
whether
or
not
all
who
are
to
eat
it
will
like
it
the
market
price
also
is
a
factor
that
can
not
be
disregarded
for
as
has
been
explained
it
is
important
to
keep
within
the
limits
of
the
amount
that
may
be
spent
and
at
the
same
time
provide
the
right
kind
of
nourishment
for
each
member
of
the
family
in
order
to
select
food
material
that
will
meet
the
requirements
just
set
forth
three
important
matters
must
be
considered
namely
the
of
which
it
is
composed
its
measure
of
material
or
what
is
called
its
or
and
its
and
until
these
are
understood
the
actual
cost
of
any
article
of
food
can
not
be
properly
determined
although
its
price
at
all
times
may
be
known
however
before
a
study
of
any
of
these
matters
is
entered
into
it
is
necessary
to
know
just
what
is
meant
by
food
and
what
food
does
for
the
body
as
is
well
understood
the
body
requires
material
by
which
it
may
be
built
and
its
tissues
repaired
when
they
are
torn
down
by
work
and
exercise
in
addition
it
requires
a
supply
of
heat
to
maintain
it
at
normal
temperature
and
provide
it
with
sufficient
energy
to
do
the
work
required
of
it
the
material
that
will
accomplish
these
important
things
is
food
which
may
therefore
be
regarded
as
anything
that
when
taken
into
the
body
will
build
and
repair
its
tissues
or
will
furnish
it
with
the
energy
required
to
do
its
work
food
substances
although
as
has
just
been
stated
food
may
be
considered
as
anything
that
the
human
engine
can
make
over
into
tissue
or
use
in
living
and
working
not
all
foods
are
equally
desirable
any
more
than
all
materials
are
equally
good
in
the
construction
of
a
steam
engine
and
in
the
production
of
its
working
power
those
food
substances
which
are
the
most
wholesome
and
healthful
are
the
ones
to
be
chosen
but
proper
choice
can
not
be
made
unless
the
buyer
knows
of
what
the
particular
food
consists
and
what
it
is
expected
to
do
to
aid
in
the
selection
of
food
therefore
it
is
extremely
necessary
to
become
familiar
with
the
five
substances
constituents
or
principles
of
which
foods
are
made
up
namely
water
mineral
matter
or
ash
protein
fat
and
carbohydrate
a
knowledge
of
these
will
help
also
in
determining
the
cooking
methods
to
adopt
for
this
depends
on
the
effect
that
heat
has
on
the
various
substances
present
in
a
food
of
course
so
far
as
flavor
is
concerned
it
is
possible
for
the
experienced
cook
to
prepare
many
dishes
successfully
without
knowing
the
effect
of
heat
on
the
different
food
constituents
but
to
cook
intelligently
with
that
success
which
makes
for
actual
economy
and
digestibility
certain
facts
must
be
known
concerning
the
food
principles
and
the
effect
of
dry
and
moist
heat
on
foods
of
the
various
constituents
that
are
found
in
the
human
body
water
occurs
in
the
largest
quantity
as
a
food
substance
it
is
an
extremely
important
feature
of
a
person
diet
its
chief
purpose
is
to
replenish
the
liquids
of
the
body
and
to
assist
in
the
digestion
of
food
although
nature
provides
considerable
amounts
of
water
in
most
foods
large
quantities
must
be
taken
in
the
diet
as
a
beverage
in
fact
it
is
the
need
of
the
body
for
water
that
has
led
to
the
development
of
numerous
beverages
besides
being
necessary
in
building
up
the
body
and
keeping
it
in
a
healthy
condition
water
has
a
special
function
to
perform
in
cooking
as
is
explained
later
although
this
food
substance
is
extremely
essential
to
life
it
is
seldom
considered
in
the
selection
of
food
because
as
has
just
been
mentioned
nearly
all
foods
contain
water
mineral
ranking
next
to
water
in
the
quantity
contained
in
the
human
body
is
mineral
matter
this
constituent
which
is
also
called
or
forms
the
main
part
of
the
body
framework
or
skeleton
in
the
building
and
maintaining
of
the
body
mineral
salts
serve
three
purposes
to
give
rigidity
and
permanence
to
the
skeleton
to
form
an
essential
element
of
active
tissue
and
to
provide
the
required
alkalinity
or
acidity
for
the
digestive
juices
and
other
secretions
the
origin
and
distribution
of
these
mineral
substances
are
of
interest
plants
in
their
growth
seize
from
the
earth
the
salts
of
minerals
and
combine
them
with
other
substances
that
make
up
their
living
tissue
then
human
beings
as
well
as
other
living
creatures
get
their
supply
of
these
needed
salts
from
the
plants
that
they
take
as
food
this
being
the
only
form
in
which
the
salts
can
be
thoroughly
assimilated
these
salts
are
not
affected
by
cooking
unless
some
process
is
used
that
removes
such
of
them
as
are
readily
soluble
in
water
when
this
occurs
the
result
is
usually
waste
as
for
instance
where
no
use
is
made
of
the
water
in
which
some
vegetables
are
boiled
as
is
true
of
water
mineral
matter
even
though
it
is
found
in
large
quantities
in
the
body
is
usually
disregarded
when
food
is
purchased
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
this
important
nutritive
material
appears
in
some
form
in
nearly
all
foods
and
therefore
does
not
necessitate
the
housewife
stopping
to
question
its
presence
the
food
substance
known
as
protein
is
a
very
important
factor
in
the
growth
and
repair
of
the
body
in
fact
these
processes
can
not
be
carried
on
unless
protein
is
present
in
the
diet
however
while
a
certain
quantity
of
protein
is
essential
the
amount
is
not
very
large
and
more
than
is
required
is
likely
to
be
harmful
or
since
the
body
can
make
no
use
of
it
to
be
at
least
waste
material
the
principal
sources
of
protein
are
lean
meat
eggs
milk
certain
grains
nuts
and
the
legumes
which
include
such
foods
as
beans
and
peas
because
of
the
ease
with
which
they
are
digested
meat
fish
eggs
and
milk
are
more
valuable
sources
of
protein
than
bread
beans
and
nuts
however
as
the
foods
that
are
most
valuable
for
proteins
cost
more
than
others
a
mixed
diet
is
necessary
if
only
a
limited
amount
of
money
with
which
to
purchase
foods
is
available
so
much
is
involved
in
the
cooking
of
foods
containing
protein
that
the
effect
of
heat
on
such
foods
should
be
thoroughly
understood
the
cooking
of
any
food
as
is
generally
understood
tends
to
break
up
the
food
and
prepare
it
for
digestion
however
foods
have
certain
characteristics
such
as
their
structure
and
texture
that
influence
their
digestibility
and
the
method
of
cooking
used
or
the
degree
to
which
the
cooking
is
carried
so
affects
these
characteristics
as
to
increase
or
decrease
the
digestibility
of
the
food
in
the
case
of
foods
containing
protein
unless
the
cooking
is
properly
done
the
application
of
heat
is
liable
to
make
the
protein
indigestible
for
the
heat
first
coagulates
this
substance
that
is
causes
it
to
become
thick
and
then
as
the
heat
increases
shrinks
and
hardens
it
this
fact
is
clearly
demonstrated
in
the
cooking
of
an
egg
the
white
of
which
is
the
type
of
protein
called
in
a
raw
egg
the
albumin
is
nearly
liquid
but
as
heat
is
applied
it
gradually
coagulates
until
it
becomes
solid
if
the
egg
is
cooked
too
fast
or
too
long
it
toughens
and
shrinks
and
becomes
less
palatable
less
attractive
and
less
digestible
however
if
the
egg
is
properly
cooked
after
the
heat
has
coagulated
the
albumin
the
white
will
remain
tender
and
the
yolk
will
be
fine
and
mealy
in
texture
thus
rendering
it
digestible
similar
results
although
not
so
evident
to
the
sight
are
brought
about
through
the
right
or
wrong
way
of
cooking
practically
all
other
foods
that
contain
much
protein
milk
whose
principal
ingredient
is
a
protein
known
as
familiar
as
the
curd
of
cheese
illustrates
this
fact
very
plainly
when
it
is
used
to
make
cottage
cheese
heating
it
too
long
or
to
too
high
a
degree
will
toughen
the
curd
and
actually
spoil
the
texture
of
the
product
which
will
be
grainy
and
hard
instead
of
smooth
and
tender
the
food
substances
just
discussed
water
mineral
matter
and
protein
yield
the
materials
required
for
building
and
repairing
the
tissues
of
the
body
but
as
has
been
explained
the
body
also
requires
foods
that
produce
energy
or
working
power
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
total
solids
of
food
taken
into
the
body
serve
this
purpose
and
of
these
fats
form
a
large
percentage
although
fats
make
up
such
a
large
proportion
of
the
daily
food
supply
they
enter
into
the
body
composition
to
a
less
extent
than
do
the
food
substances
that
have
been
explained
the
fats
commonly
used
for
food
are
of
both
animal
and
vegetable
origin
such
as
lard
suet
butter
cream
olive
oil
nut
oil
and
cottonseed
oil
the
ordinary
cooking
temperatures
have
comparatively
little
effect
on
fat
except
to
melt
it
if
it
is
solid
the
higher
temperatures
decompose
at
least
some
of
it
and
thus
liberate
substances
that
may
be
irritating
to
the
digestive
tract
like
fats
the
food
substances
included
in
the
term
carbohydrates
supply
the
body
with
energy
however
fats
and
carbohydrates
differ
in
the
forms
in
which
they
supply
energy
the
former
producing
it
in
the
most
concentrated
form
and
the
latter
in
the
most
economical
form
so
that
the
term
may
be
clearly
understood
and
firmly
fixed
in
the
mind
it
is
deemed
advisable
to
discuss
briefly
the
composition
of
the
body
and
the
food
that
enters
it
of
course
in
a
lesson
on
cookery
not
so
much
attention
need
be
given
to
this
matter
as
in
a
lesson
on
which
is
a
branch
of
hygiene
that
treats
of
diet
nevertheless
it
is
important
that
every
person
who
prepares
food
for
the
table
be
familiar
with
the
fact
that
the
body
as
well
as
food
is
made
up
of
a
certain
number
of
chemical
elements
of
which
nitrogen
carbon
hydrogen
and
oxygen
form
a
large
part
protein
owes
its
importance
to
the
fact
that
of
the
various
food
substances
it
alone
contains
the
element
nitrogen
which
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
formation
of
any
plant
or
animal
tissue
the
other
three
elements
carbon
hydrogen
and
oxygen
go
to
make
up
the
carbohydrates
in
fact
it
is
from
the
names
of
these
three
elements
that
the
term
carbohydrate
is
derived
the
carbohydrates
include
the
starches
and
sugars
that
are
used
and
eaten
in
so
many
forms
and
these
contain
the
three
elements
mentioned
the
hydrogen
and
oxygen
contained
in
them
being
in
the
proportion
that
produces
water
thus
as
will
readily
be
seen
by
separating
the
name
into
its
parts
carbon
and
hydrogen
and
oxygen
in
the
proportion
of
two
parts
of
hydrogen
and
one
of
oxygen
that
is
in
the
form
of
water
carbohydrate
is
simply
carbon
united
with
water
while
the
facts
just
brought
out
have
much
to
do
with
food
economy
they
are
of
interest
here
chiefly
because
they
help
to
make
clear
the
term
carbohydrate
which
as
will
be
admitted
is
the
only
correct
name
for
the
food
substance
it
represents
starch
one
of
the
chief
forms
of
carbohydrates
is
found
in
only
the
vegetable
kingdom
it
is
present
in
large
quantities
in
the
grains
and
in
potatoes
in
fact
nearly
all
vegetables
contain
large
or
small
amounts
of
it
it
is
stored
in
the
plant
in
the
form
of
granules
that
lie
within
the
plant
cells
cooking
applied
to
starch
changes
it
into
a
form
that
is
digestible
moist
heat
cooks
the
granules
until
they
expand
and
burst
and
thus
thicken
the
mass
dry
heat
changes
starch
first
into
a
soluble
form
and
finally
into
what
is
called
this
being
the
intermediate
step
in
the
changing
of
starch
into
sugar
sugar
another
important
form
of
carbohydrate
is
mainly
of
vegetable
origin
except
that
which
is
found
in
milk
and
called
this
together
with
the
fat
found
in
milk
supplies
the
child
with
energy
before
it
is
able
to
digest
a
variety
of
foods
the
sap
of
various
plants
contains
such
large
quantities
of
sugar
that
it
can
be
crystalized
out
and
secured
in
dry
form
the
liquid
that
remains
is
valuable
as
food
for
by
boiling
it
down
it
forms
molasses
sugar
is
also
present
in
considerable
amounts
in
all
fruits
and
much
of
it
is
in
a
form
that
can
be
assimilated
or
taken
up
by
the
body
quickly
a
sugar
very
similar
to
this
natural
fruit
sugar
is
made
from
the
starch
of
corn
and
is
called
much
of
the
carbohydrate
found
in
vegetables
especially
young
tender
vegetables
is
in
the
form
of
sugar
which
as
the
vegetables
grow
older
changes
to
starch
sugar
melts
upon
the
application
of
heat
or
if
it
is
in
a
melted
condition
as
sirup
or
molasses
it
boils
down
and
gives
off
water
when
all
the
water
has
boiled
away
the
sugar
begins
to
caramelize
or
become
brown
and
develops
a
characteristic
flavor
if
the
cooking
is
continued
too
long
a
color
and
a
bitter
taste
are
developed
because
the
sugar
in
fruits
and
vegetables
is
in
solution
some
of
it
is
lost
when
they
are
boiled
unless
of
course
the
water
in
which
they
are
cooked
is
utilized
cellulose
is
a
form
of
carbohydrate
closely
related
to
starch
it
helps
to
form
the
structure
of
plants
and
vegetables
very
little
cellulose
is
digested
but
it
should
not
be
ignored
because
it
gives
the
necessary
bulk
to
the
food
in
which
it
occurs
and
because
strict
attention
must
be
paid
to
the
cooking
of
it
as
cellulose
usually
surrounds
nutritive
material
of
vegetable
origin
it
must
be
softened
and
loosened
sufficiently
by
cooking
to
permit
the
nutritive
material
to
be
dissolved
by
the
digestive
juices
then
too
in
old
vegetables
there
is
more
starch
and
the
cellulose
is
harder
and
tougher
just
as
an
old
tree
is
much
harder
than
a
sapling
this
then
accounts
for
the
fact
that
rapid
cooking
is
needed
for
some
vegetables
and
slow
cooking
for
others
the
method
and
the
time
of
cooking
depending
on
the
presence
and
the
consistency
of
the
cellulose
that
occurs
in
the
food
importance
of
a
variety
of
every
one
of
the
five
food
substances
just
considered
must
be
included
in
a
person
diet
yet
with
the
exception
of
milk
no
single
food
yields
the
right
amounts
of
material
necessary
for
tissue
building
and
repair
and
for
heat
and
energy
even
milk
is
in
the
right
proportion
as
far
as
its
food
substances
are
concerned
only
for
babies
and
very
young
children
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
to
provide
the
body
with
the
right
foods
the
diet
must
be
such
as
to
include
all
the
food
substances
in
food
selection
therefore
the
characteristics
of
the
various
food
substances
must
be
considered
well
fats
yield
the
most
heat
but
are
the
most
slowly
digested
proteins
and
carbohydrates
are
more
quickly
digested
than
fats
but
in
equal
amounts
have
less
than
half
as
much
food
value
water
and
mineral
salts
do
not
yield
heat
but
are
required
to
build
tissue
and
to
keep
the
body
in
a
healthy
condition
in
addition
it
is
well
to
note
that
a
diet
is
one
that
contains
all
of
the
five
food
substances
in
just
the
right
proportion
in
which
the
individual
needs
them
to
build
up
the
body
repair
it
and
supply
it
with
energy
what
this
proportion
should
be
however
can
not
be
stated
offhand
because
the
quantity
and
kind
of
food
substances
necessarily
vary
with
the
size
age
and
activity
of
each
person
food
value
nearly
all
foods
are
complex
substances
and
they
differ
from
one
another
in
what
is
known
as
their
which
is
measured
by
the
work
the
food
does
in
the
body
either
as
a
tissue
builder
or
as
a
producer
of
energy
however
in
considering
food
value
the
person
who
prepares
food
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
individual
appetite
must
be
appealed
to
by
a
sufficient
variety
of
appetizing
foods
there
would
be
neither
economy
nor
advantage
in
serving
food
that
does
not
please
those
who
are
to
eat
it
while
all
foods
supply
the
body
with
energy
they
differ
very
much
in
the
quantity
they
yield
if
certain
ones
were
chosen
solely
for
that
purpose
it
would
be
necessary
for
any
ordinary
person
to
consume
a
larger
quantity
of
them
than
could
be
eaten
at
any
one
time
for
instance
green
vegetables
furnish
the
body
with
a
certain
amount
of
energy
but
they
can
not
be
eaten
to
the
exclusion
of
other
things
because
no
person
could
eat
in
a
day
a
sufficient
amount
of
them
to
give
the
body
all
the
energy
it
would
need
for
that
day
work
on
the
other
hand
certain
foods
produce
principally
building
material
and
if
they
were
taken
for
the
purpose
of
yielding
only
energy
they
would
be
much
too
expensive
meats
for
example
build
up
the
body
but
a
diet
would
cost
too
much
if
meat
alone
were
depended
on
to
provide
the
body
with
all
the
energy
it
requires
many
foods
too
contain
mineral
salts
which
as
has
been
pointed
out
are
needed
for
building
tissue
and
keeping
the
body
in
a
healthy
condition
to
come
to
a
correct
appreciation
of
the
value
of
different
foods
it
is
necessary
to
understand
the
unit
employed
to
measure
the
amount
of
work
that
foods
do
in
the
body
this
unit
is
the
calorie
or
and
it
is
used
to
measure
foods
just
as
the
inch
the
yard
the
pound
the
pint
and
the
quart
are
the
units
used
to
measure
materials
and
liquids
however
instead
of
measuring
the
food
itself
it
determines
its
food
value
or
fuel
value
to
illustrate
what
is
meant
consider
for
instance
ounce
of
sugar
and
ounce
of
butter
as
far
as
the
actual
weight
of
these
two
foods
is
concerned
they
are
equal
but
with
regard
to
the
work
they
do
in
the
body
they
differ
considerably
their
relative
value
in
the
body
however
can
be
determined
if
they
are
measured
by
some
unit
that
can
be
applied
to
both
it
is
definitely
known
that
both
of
them
produce
heat
when
they
are
oxidized
that
is
when
they
are
combined
with
oxygen
thus
the
logical
way
of
measuring
them
is
to
determine
the
quantity
of
heat
that
will
be
produced
when
they
are
eaten
and
united
with
oxygen
a
process
that
causes
the
liberation
of
heat
the
calorie
is
the
unit
by
which
this
heat
can
be
measured
it
being
the
quantity
of
heat
required
to
raise
the
temperature
of
pint
of
water
degrees
fahrenheit
which
is
the
name
of
the
thermometer
commonly
used
in
the
home
when
burned
as
fuel
a
square
of
butter
weighing
ounce
produces
enough
heat
to
raise
pint
of
water
degrees
fahrenheit
and
it
will
yield
the
same
amount
of
heat
when
it
is
eaten
and
goes
through
the
slow
process
of
oxidation
in
the
body
on
the
other
hand
ounce
of
sugar
upon
being
oxidized
will
produce
only
enough
heat
to
raise
the
temperature
of
pint
of
water
about
degrees
fahrenheit
thus
as
will
be
seen
ounce
of
butter
has
a
value
of
approximately
calories
whereas
ounce
of
sugar
contains
only
about
calories
other
foods
yield
heat
in
varying
degrees
and
their
food
value
is
determined
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
that
of
butter
and
sugar
to
give
an
idea
of
the
composition
of
various
food
materials
as
well
as
the
number
of
calories
that
pound
of
these
food
materials
will
yield
food
charts
published
by
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
are
here
presented
as
an
understanding
of
these
charts
will
prove
extremely
profitable
in
the
selection
of
food
a
careful
study
of
them
at
this
time
is
urged
in
addition
reference
to
them
should
be
made
from
time
to
time
as
the
various
kinds
of
foods
are
taken
up
as
the
charts
will
then
be
more
easily
comprehended
and
their
contents
of
more
value
digestion
and
absorption
of
food
the
third
requirement
in
the
selection
of
food
namely
its
digestion
and
absorption
depends
considerably
on
the
persons
who
are
to
be
fed
food
that
is
chosen
for
adults
entirely
would
not
be
the
same
as
that
intended
for
both
young
persons
and
adults
neither
would
food
that
is
to
be
fed
to
children
or
persons
who
are
ill
be
the
same
as
that
which
is
to
be
served
to
robust
adults
who
do
a
normal
amount
of
work
no
rules
can
be
laid
down
here
for
this
phase
of
food
selection
but
as
these
lessons
in
cookery
are
taken
up
in
turn
the
necessary
knowledge
regarding
digestibility
will
be
acquired

reasons
for
cooking
food
the
term
cookery
as
has
been
explained
means
the
preparation
of
both
hot
and
cold
dishes
for
use
as
food
as
well
as
the
selection
of
the
materials
or
substances
that
are
to
be
cooked
the
importance
of
cooking
foods
by
subjecting
them
to
the
action
of
heat
has
been
recognized
for
ages
and
while
it
is
true
that
there
are
many
foods
that
appeal
to
the
appetite
in
their
raw
state
and
still
others
that
can
be
eaten
either
raw
or
cooked
there
are
several
reasons
why
it
is
desirable
to
cook
food
as
will
be
seen
from
the
following
cooking
makes
foods
more
palatable
this
is
true
of
such
foods
as
meat
cereals
and
many
vegetables
which
would
be
very
unappetizing
if
they
were
eaten
raw
cooking
renders
foods
more
digestible
for
instance
the
hard
grains
such
as
wheat
and
the
dried
vegetables
such
as
beans
can
not
be
readily
digested
unless
they
are
softened
by
cooking
but
while
cooking
makes
such
foods
more
digestible
it
renders
others
more
difficult
of
digestion
as
in
the
case
of
eggs
the
degree
of
digestibility
depending
somewhat
on
the
cooking
method
used
and
the
skill
of
the
cook
an
egg
in
an
almost
liquid
form
or
when
only
slightly
cooked
as
a
egg
is
more
easily
digested
than
when
it
becomes
hardened
by
cooking
then
too
a
properly
prepared
egg
is
more
digestible
than
an
improperly
cooked
one
although
the
degree
of
hardness
may
be
the
same
cooking
gives
foods
greater
variety
the
same
food
may
be
cooked
by
various
methods
and
be
given
very
different
tastes
and
appearances
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
combined
with
a
large
number
of
other
foods
so
as
to
increase
the
variety
of
the
dishes
in
which
it
is
used
the
large
number
of
recipes
found
in
cook
books
show
the
attempts
that
have
been
made
to
obtain
variety
in
cooked
dishes
by
the
combining
of
different
foods
cooking
sterilizes
foods
either
partly
or
completely
many
foods
need
partial
or
complete
sterilization
for
safety
they
must
be
completely
sterilized
if
the
germs
that
produce
fermentation
or
putrefaction
and
thereby
spoil
food
would
be
destroyed
this
is
done
when
fruits
and
vegetables
are
canned
for
keeping
foods
that
are
exposed
to
dust
flies
and
improper
handling
should
be
thoroughly
cooked
in
order
to
destroy
any
pathogenic
germs
that
might
be
present
by
such
germs
are
meant
germs
they
differ
from
germs
that
produce
fermentation
and
putrefaction
or
spoiling
and
that
must
in
general
be
considered
as
a
help
for
these
play
an
important
part
in
the
raising
of
bread
and
the
preparation
of
various
foods
as
is
pointed
out
later
cooking
develops
flavor
in
many
foods
in
the
case
of
some
vegetables
the
flavoring
substance
is
given
off
in
the
air
by
certain
methods
of
cooking
and
a
better
flavor
is
thereby
developed
methods
of
cooking
cooking
processes
food
is
cooked
by
the
application
of
heat
which
may
be
either
moist
or
dry
while
it
is
true
that
the
art
of
cooking
includes
the
preparation
of
material
that
is
served
or
eaten
raw
cooking
itself
is
impossible
without
heat
indeed
the
part
of
cooking
that
requires
the
most
skill
and
experience
is
that
in
which
heat
is
involved
explicit
directions
for
carrying
on
the
various
cooking
processes
depend
on
the
kind
of
stove
the
cooking
utensils
and
even
the
atmospheric
conditions
in
truth
the
results
of
some
processes
depend
so
much
on
the
state
of
the
atmosphere
that
they
are
not
successful
on
a
day
on
which
it
is
damp
and
heavy
also
as
is
well
known
the
stove
acts
perfectly
on
some
days
whereas
on
other
days
it
seems
to
have
a
stubborn
will
of
its
own
besides
the
difficulties
mentioned
the
heat
itself
sometimes
presents
obstacles
in
the
cooking
of
foods
to
regulate
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
keep
it
uniform
being
often
a
hard
matter
thus
a
dish
may
be
spoiled
by
subjecting
it
to
heat
that
is
too
intense
by
cooking
it
too
long
or
by
not
cooking
it
rapidly
enough
all
these
points
must
be
learned
and
the
best
way
to
master
them
is
to
put
into
constant
practice
the
principles
that
are
involved
in
cookery
without
doubt
the
first
step
in
gaining
a
mastery
of
cookery
is
to
become
familiar
with
the
different
methods
and
processes
the
ways
in
which
they
are
applied
and
the
reasons
for
applying
them
there
are
numerous
ways
of
cooking
food
but
the
principal
processes
are
boiling
stewing
steaming
dry
steaming
braizing
fricasseeing
roasting
baking
broiling
pan
broiling
frying
and
sautéing
which
one
of
these
to
use
will
depend
on
the
food
that
is
to
be
cooked
and
the
result
desired
if
the
wrong
method
is
employed
there
will
be
a
waste
of
food
material
or
the
food
will
be
rendered
less
desirable
in
flavor
or
tenderness
for
example
it
would
be
both
wasteful
and
undesirable
to
roast
a
tough
old
fowl
or
to
boil
a
tender
young
broiler
the
various
methods
of
cookery
just
mentioned
naturally
divide
themselves
into
three
groups
namely
those
involving
dry
heat
those
requiring
moist
heat
and
those
in
which
hot
fat
is
the
cooking
medium
cooking
with
dry
heat
cooking
with
dry
heat
includes
broiling
pan
broiling
roasting
and
baking
but
whichever
of
these
processes
is
used
the
principle
is
practically
the
same
in
these
processes
the
food
is
cooked
by
being
exposed
to
the
source
of
heat
or
by
being
placed
in
a
closed
oven
and
subjected
to
heated
air
when
dry
heat
is
applied
the
food
to
be
cooked
is
heated
to
a
much
greater
temperature
than
when
moist
heat
is
used
the
cooking
process
known
as
broiling
consists
in
exposing
directly
to
the
source
of
heat
the
food
that
is
to
be
cooked
that
is
in
cooking
it
over
or
before
a
clear
bed
of
coals
or
a
gas
flame
the
aim
in
broiling
is
to
retain
the
juices
of
food
and
develop
flavor
as
it
is
a
quick
method
foods
that
are
not
tender
as
for
example
tough
meats
should
not
be
broiled
because
broiling
does
not
help
to
render
their
fibers
more
tender
in
applying
this
cooking
process
which
is
particularly
suitable
for
tender
portions
of
meat
and
for
young
fowl
the
food
should
be
exposed
to
intense
heat
at
first
in
order
to
sear
all
surfaces
quickly
and
thus
retain
the
juices
at
the
beginning
of
the
cooking
the
article
that
is
being
broiled
should
be
turned
often
then
as
soon
as
the
outside
is
browned
the
heat
should
be
reduced
if
possible
as
with
a
gas
stove
and
the
article
allowed
to
cook
until
done
if
the
broiling
is
done
over
coals
it
is
necessary
to
continue
the
turning
during
the
entire
process
while
broiling
produces
an
especially
good
flavor
in
the
foods
to
which
it
is
applied
provided
they
are
not
tough
it
is
not
the
most
economical
way
of
cooking
pan
pan
broiling
is
an
adaptation
of
the
broiling
method
it
consists
in
cooking
food
in
a
pan
on
top
of
the
stove
without
the
use
of
fat
in
this
process
the
surfaces
of
the
steak
chop
or
whatever
the
food
may
be
are
quickly
seared
after
which
the
article
is
turned
frequently
and
cooked
more
slowly
until
done
the
object
of
pan
broiling
is
the
same
as
that
of
broiling
and
it
is
resorted
to
as
a
rule
when
the
fire
is
not
in
the
right
condition
for
broiling
originally
the
term
meant
to
cook
before
a
fire
because
before
the
time
of
stoves
practically
all
food
was
cooked
in
the
fireplace
food
that
was
to
be
roasted
was
placed
before
the
fire
in
a
device
that
reflected
heat
this
device
being
open
on
the
side
toward
the
fire
and
closed
on
that
toward
the
room
the
roast
was
suspended
in
this
device
slowly
turned
and
thus
cooked
by
radiant
heat
that
is
heat
given
off
in
the
form
of
direct
rays
the
principle
being
the
same
as
that
of
broiling
but
the
application
different
nowadays
the
term
is
almost
universally
applied
to
the
action
of
both
hot
air
and
radiant
heat
however
much
of
what
is
called
roasting
is
in
reality
baking
foods
cooked
in
the
oven
of
an
ordinary
coal
or
gas
range
are
really
baked
although
they
are
said
to
be
roasted
and
a
covered
roasting
pan
is
a
misnomer
food
must
be
exposed
to
the
air
in
the
process
of
cooking
if
it
is
to
be
roasted
in
the
true
sense
it
may
be
well
to
note
that
successful
roasting
or
broiling
depends
more
on
the
shape
of
the
article
to
be
roasted
or
broiled
than
on
its
weight
for
this
reason
thick
compact
cuts
of
meat
are
usually
selected
for
roasting
and
thin
cuts
for
broiling
good
results
also
depend
very
much
on
the
pan
selected
for
the
roasting
process
one
of
the
great
aims
in
cooking
should
be
to
save
or
conserve
all
the
food
possible
that
is
if
by
one
process
less
waste
in
cooking
results
it
should
be
chosen
rather
than
one
that
will
result
in
loss
at
the
end
of
the
cooking
process
by
baking
is
meant
cooking
in
a
heated
oven
at
temperatures
ranging
from
to
degrees
fahrenheit
as
the
term
baking
is
frequently
used
in
a
wrong
sense
the
actual
conditions
of
the
process
should
be
thoroughly
understood
in
both
broiling
and
the
original
method
of
roasting
the
heat
is
applied
directly
that
is
the
food
is
exposed
directly
to
the
source
of
heat
actual
baking
differs
from
these
processes
in
that
it
is
done
in
a
closed
oven
or
by
means
of
heated
air
starchy
foods
such
as
bread
cakes
and
pastry
are
nearly
always
baked
and
gradually
other
foods
such
as
meats
fish
and
vegetables
are
being
subjected
to
this
method
of
cooking
in
fact
persons
who
are
skilled
in
cooking
use
the
oven
more
and
more
for
things
that
they
formerly
thought
had
to
be
cooked
in
other
ways
but
the
name
that
is
applied
to
the
process
depends
somewhat
on
custom
for
while
meat
that
is
cooked
in
the
oven
is
really
baked
it
is
usually
termed
roasted
meat
it
seems
strange
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
ham
cooked
in
the
oven
has
always
been
termed
baked
while
turkey
cooked
in
exactly
the
same
way
is
said
to
be
roasted
cooking
with
moist
heat
the
methods
of
cooking
with
moist
heat
that
is
through
the
medium
of
water
are
boiling
simmering
steaming
dry
steaming
and
braizing
in
every
one
of
these
processes
the
effect
of
moist
heat
on
food
is
entirely
different
from
that
of
dry
heat
however
the
method
to
be
selected
depends
to
a
great
extent
on
the
amount
of
water
that
the
food
contains
to
some
foods
much
water
must
be
added
in
the
cooking
process
to
others
only
a
little
or
none
at
all
if
food
is
not
placed
directly
in
large
or
small
quantities
of
water
it
is
cooked
by
contact
with
steam
or
in
a
utensil
that
is
heated
by
being
placed
in
another
containing
boiling
water
as
for
example
a
double
boiler
as
water
is
such
an
important
factor
in
cooking
with
moist
heat
something
concerning
its
nature
and
use
should
be
understood
therefore
before
considering
the
cooking
processes
in
detail
the
function
of
water
in
the
body
and
in
cooking
and
also
the
kinds
of
water
are
discussed
function
of
water
in
the
water
supplies
no
energy
to
the
body
but
it
plays
a
very
important
part
in
nutrition
in
fact
its
particular
function
in
the
body
is
to
act
as
a
solvent
and
a
carrier
of
nutritive
material
and
waste
in
doing
this
work
it
keeps
the
liquids
of
the
body
properly
diluted
increases
the
flow
of
the
digestive
juices
and
helps
to
carry
off
waste
material
however
its
ability
to
perform
these
necessary
functions
in
the
right
way
depends
on
its
quality
and
its
safety
kinds
of
water
is
either
hard
or
soft
as
it
falls
from
the
clouds
it
is
pure
and
soft
until
it
comes
in
contact
with
gases
and
solids
which
are
dissolved
by
it
and
change
its
character
it
is
definitely
known
that
the
last
of
the
water
that
falls
in
a
shower
is
much
better
than
the
first
as
the
first
cleanses
not
only
the
air
but
the
roofs
and
other
things
with
which
it
comes
in
contact
in
passing
through
certain
kinds
of
soil
or
over
rocks
water
dissolves
some
of
the
minerals
that
are
contained
there
and
is
thus
changed
from
soft
to
hard
water
if
sewage
drains
into
a
well
or
water

upon

every
housewife
who
uses
a

is
familiar
with
this
condition
the

thickly

permanent

caused
by
other

that

the
only
way
in

is
to
add
to
it
an
alkali

as

the
solvent

power
of
water
that
makes
this
liquid
valuable
in
cooking
but
of
the
two
kinds
soft
water
is
preferable
to
hard
because
it
possesses
greater
solvent
power
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
hard
water
has
already
dissolved
a
certain
amount
of
material
and
will
therefore
dissolve
less
of
the
food
substances
and
flavors
when
it
is
used
for
cooking
purposes
than
soft
water
which
has
dissolved
nothing
it
is
known
too
that
the
flavor
of
such
beverages
as
tea
and
coffee
is
often
greatly
impaired
by
the
use
of
hard
water
dried
beans
and
peas
cereals
and
tough
cuts
of
meat
will
not
cook
tender
so
readily
in
hard
water
as
in
soft
but
the
addition
of
a
small
amount
of
soda
during
the
cooking
of
these
foods
will
assist
in
softening
them
water
is
used
in
cooking
chiefly
for
extracting
flavors
as
in
the
making
of
coffee
tea
and
soups
as
a
medium
for
carrying
flavors
and
foods
in
such
beverages
as
lemonade
and
cocoa
for
softening
both
vegetable
and
animal
fiber
and
for
cooking
starch
and
dissolving
sugar
salt
gelatine
etc
in
accomplishing
much
of
this
work
water
acts
as
a
medium
for
conveying

means
cooking
foods
in
boiling
water
water
boils
when
its
temperature
is
raised
by
heat
to
what
is
commonly
termed
its
this
varies
with
the
atmospheric
pressure
but
at
sea
level
under
ordinary
conditions
it
is
always
degrees
fahrenheit
when
the
atmospheric
pressure
on
the
surface
of
the
water
is
lessened
boiling
takes
place
at
a
lower
temperature
than
that
mentioned
and
in
extremely
high
altitudes
the
boiling
point
is
so
lowered
that
to
cook
certain
foods
by
means
of
boiling
water
is
difficult
as
the
water
heats
in
the
process
of
boiling
tiny
bubbles
appear
on
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
in
which
it
is
contained
and
rise
to
the
surface
then
gradually
the
bubbles
increase
in
size
until
large
ones
form
rise
rapidly
and
break
thus
producing
constant
agitation
of
the
water
boiling
has
various
effects
on
foods
it
toughens
the
albumin
in
eggs
toughens
the
fiber
and
dissolves
the
connective
tissues
in
meat
softens
the
cellulose
in
cereals
vegetables
and
fruits
and
dissolves
other
substances
in
many
foods
a
good
point
to
bear
in
mind
in
preparing
foods
by
boiling
is
that
slowly
boiling
water
has
the
same
temperature
as
rapidly
boiling
water
and
is
therefore
able
to
do
exactly
the
same
work
keeping
the
gas
burning
full
heat
or
running
the
fire
hard
to
keep
the
water
boiling
rapidly
is
therefore
unnecessary
besides
it
wastes
fuel
without
doing
the
work
any
faster
and
sometimes
not
so
well
however
there
are
several
factors
that
influence
the
rapidity
with
which
water
may
be
brought
to
the
boiling
point
namely
the
kind
of
utensil
used
the
amount
of
surface
exposed
and
the
quantity
of
heat
applied
a
cover
placed
on
a
saucepan
or
a
kettle
in
which
food
is
to
be
boiled
retains
the
heat
and
thus
causes
the
temperature
to
rise
more
quickly
besides
a
cover
so
used
prevents
a
loss
of
water
by
condensing
the
steam
as
it
rises
against
the
cover
as
water
boils
some
of
it
constantly
passes
off
in
the
form
of
steam
and
for
this
reason
sirups
or
sauces
become
thicker
the
longer
they
are
cooked
the
evaporation
takes
place
all
over
the
surface
of
the
water
consequently
the
greater
the
surface
exposed
the
more
quickly
is
the
quantity
of
water
decreased
during
boiling
another
point
to
observe
in
the
boiling
process
is
that
foods
boiled
rapidly
in
water
have
a
tendency
to
lose
their
shape
and
are
reduced
to
small
pieces
if
allowed
to
boil
long
enough
besides
serving
to
cook
foods
boiling
also
renders
water
safe
as
it
destroys
any
germs
that
may
be
present
this
explains
why
water
must
sometimes
be
boiled
to
make
it
safe
for
drinking
boiled
water
as
is
known
loses
its
good
taste
however
as
this
change
is
brought
about
by
the
loss
of
air
during
boiling
the
flavor
can
be
restored
and
air
again
introduced
if
the
water
is
shaken
in
a
partly
filled
jar
or
bottle
or
beaten
vigorously
for
a
short
time
with
an
egg
beater
simmering
or
the
cooking
process
known
as
simmering
or
stewing
is
a
modification
of
boiling
by
this
method
food
is
cooked
in
water
at
a
temperature
below
the
boiling
point
or
anywhere
from
to
degrees
fahrenheit
water
at
the
simmering
point
always
moves
gently
never
rapidly
as
it
does
in
boiling
less
heat
and
consequently
less
fuel
are
required
to
cook
foods
in
this
way
unless
of
course
the
time
consumed
in
cooking
the
food
at
a
low
temperature
is
much
greater
than
that
consumed
in
cooking
it
more
rapidly
aside
from
permitting
economy
in
the
use
of
fuel
simmering
or
stewing
cooks
deliciously
certain
foods
that
could
not
be
selected
for
the
more
rapid
methods
for
example
tough
cuts
of
meat
and
old
fowl
can
be
made
tender
and
tasty
by
long
cooking
at
a
low
temperature
for
this
method
tends
to
soften
the
fiber
and
to
develop
an
excellent
flavor
tough
vegetables
too
can
be
cooked
tender
by
the
simmering
process
without
using
so
much
fuel
as
would
be
used
if
they
were
boiled
for
whatever
method
is
used
they
require
long
cooking
beets
turnips
and
other
winter
vegetables
should
be
stewed
rather
than
boiled
as
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
cook
them
tender
especially
in
the
late
winter
and
early
spring
if
dry
beans
and
peas
are
brought
to
the
simmering
point
and
then
allowed
to
cook
they
can
be
prepared
for
the
table
in
practically
the
same
length
of
time
and
without
so
much
fuel
as
if
they
boiled
continuously
as
its
name
implies
steaming
is
the
cooking
of
food
by
the
application
of
steam
in
this
cooking
process
the
food
is
put
into
a
which
is
a
cooking
utensil
that
consists
of
a
vessel
with
a
perforated
bottom
placed
over
one
containing
water
as
the
water
boils
steam
rises
and
cooks
the
food
in
the
upper
or
perforated
vessel
steamers
are
sometimes
arranged
with
a
number
of
perforated
vessels
one
on
top
of
the
other
such
a
steamer
permits
of
the
cooking
of
several
foods
at
the
same
time
without
the
need
of
additional
fuel
because
a
different
food
may
be
placed
in
each
vessel
steaming
is
preferable
to
boiling
in
some
cases
because
by
it
there
is
no
loss
of
mineral
salts
nor
food
substances
besides
the
flavor
is
not
so
likely
to
be
lost
as
when
food
is
boiled
vegetables
prepared
in
this
way
prove
very
palatable
and
very
often
variety
is
added
to
the
diet
by
steaming
bread
cake
and
pudding
mixtures
and
then
provided
a
crisp
outside
is
desired
placing
them
in
a
hot
oven
to
dry

moist
surface
dry
cooking
foods
in
a
vessel
that
is
suspended
in
another
one
containing
boiling
water
constitutes
the
cooking
method
known
as
dry
steaming
the
double
boiler
is
a
cooking
utensil
devised
especially
for
carrying
on
this
process
the
food
placed
in
the
suspended
or
inner
vessel
does
not
reach
the
boiling
point
but
is
cooked
by
the
transfer
of
heat
from
the
water
in
the
outside
or
lower
vessel
a
decided
advantage
of
this
method
is
that
no
watching
is
required
except
to
see
that
the
water
in
the
lower
vessel
does
not
boil
away
completely
for
as
long
as
there
is
water
between
the
food
and
the
fire
the
food
will
neither
boil
nor
burn
because
of
the
nature
of
certain
foods
cooking
them
by
this
process
is
especially
desirable
the
flavor
and
consistency
of
cereals
and
foods
containing
starch
are
greatly
improved
by
long
cooking
in
this
way
likewise
custards
and
mixtures
containing
eggs
can
be
conveniently
cooked
in
a
double
boiler
because
they
do
not
require
a
high
temperature
in
fact
their
texture
is
spoiled
if
they
are
cooked
at
the
boiling
point
to
heat
milk
directly
over
the
flame
without
scorching
it
is
a
difficult
matter
and
on
the
other
hand
boiled
milk
is
hard
to
digest
because
of
these
facts
food
containing
milk
should
not
be
boiled
but
should
be
cooked
at
a
lower
temperature
in
a
double
boiler
cooking
meat
in
an
oven
in
a
closed
pan
with
a
small
quantity
of
water
constitutes
braizing
this
cooking
process
might
be
called
a
combination
of
stewing
and
baking
but
when
it
is
properly
carried
out
the
meat
is
placed
on
a
rack
so
as
to
be
raised
above
the
water
in
which
may
be
placed
sliced
vegetables
in
this
process
the
meat
actually
cooks
in
the
flavored
steam
that
surrounds
it
in
the
hot
pan
the
double
roasting
pans
are
in
fact
braizing
pans
when
they
are
properly
used
a
pot
roast
is
the
result
of
a
modification
of
the
braizing
method
cooking
with
hot
fat
of
the
three
mediums
of
conveying
heat
to
food
namely
hot
air
hot
water
and
hot
fat
that
of
hot
fat
renders
food
the
least
digestible
much
of
this
difficulty
however
can
be
overcome
if
an
effort
is
made
to
secure
as
little
absorption
of
the
fat
as
possible
if
the
ingredients
of
the
food
are
properly
mixed
before
applying
the
fat
and
if
the
fat
is
at
the
right
temperature
good
results
can
be
obtained
by
the
various
methods
of
cooking
with
hot
fat
which
are
frying
sautéing
and
fricasseeing
by
frying
is
meant
the
cooking
of
food
in
deep
fat
at
a
temperature
of
to
degrees
fahrenheit
any
kind
of
fat
that
will
not
impart
flavor
to
the
food
may
be
used
for
frying
but
the
vegetable
oils
such
as
cottonseed
oils
combinations
of
coconut
and
cottonseed
oils
and
nut
oils
are
preferable
to
lards
and
other
animal
fats
because
they
do
not
burn
so
easily
foods
cooked
in
deep
fat
will
not
absorb
the
fat
nor
become
greasy
if
they
are
properly
prepared
quickly
fried
and
well
drained
on
paper
that
will
absorb
any
extra
fat
browning

on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
in
a
small
quantity
of
fat
is
termed
sautéing
in
this
cooking
process
the
fat
is
placed
in
a
shallow
pan
and
when
it
is
sufficiently
hot
the
food
is
put
into
it
foods
that
are
to
be
sautéd
are
usually
sliced
thin
or
cut
into
small
pieces
and
they
are
turned
frequently
during
the
process
of
cooking
all
foods
prepared
in
this
way
are
difficult
to
digest
because
they
become
more
or
less
hard
and
soaked
with
fat
chops
and
thin
cuts
of
meat
which
are
intended
to
be

really
sautéd

they
are
allowed

of
them
a
combination
of
sautéing
and
stewing
results
in
the
cooking
process
known
as
fricasseeing
this
process
is
used
in
preparing
such
foods
as
chicken
veal
or
game
but
it
is
more
frequently
employed
for
cooking
fowl
which
in
cookery
is
the
term
used
to
distinguish
the
old
of
domestic
fowls
from
chickens
or
pullets
in
fricasseeing
the
meat
to
be
cooked
is
cut
into
pieces
and
sautéd
either
before
or
after
stewing
then
it
is
served
with
a
white
or
a
brown
sauce
ordinarily
the
meat
should
be
browned
first
unless
it
is
very
tough
in
order
to
retain
the
juices
and
improve
the
flavor
however
very
old

should
be
stewed

and
then
browned
heat
for
cooking
general
discussion
inasmuch
as
heat
is
so
important
a
factor
in
the
cooking
of
foods
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
person
who
is
to
prepare
them
be
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
ways
in
which
this
heat
is
produced
the
production
of
heat
for
cooking
involves
the
use
of
fuels
and
stoves
in
which
to
burn
them
as
well
as
electricity
which
serves
the
purpose
of
a
fuel
and
apparatus
for
using
electricity
in
order
therefore
that
the
best
results
may
be
obtained
in
cookery
these
subjects
are
here
taken
up
in
detail
probably
the
first
fuel
to
be
used
in
the
production
of
heat
for
cooking
was
wood
but
later
such
fuels
as
peat
coal
charcoal
coke
and
kerosene
came
into
use
of
these
fuels
coal
gas
and
kerosene
are
used
to
the
greatest
extent
in
the
united
states
wood
of
course
is
used
considerably
for
kindling
fires
and
it
serves
as
fuel
in
localities
where
it
is
abundant
or
less
difficult
to
procure
than
other
fuels
however
it
is
fast
becoming
too
scarce
and
too
expensive
to
burn
if
it
must
be
burned
for
cooking
purposes
those
who
use
it
should
remember
that
dry
hard
wood
gives
off
heat
at
a
more
even
rate
than
soft
wood
which
is
usually
selected
for
kindling
electricity
is
coming
into
favor
for
supplying
heat
for
cooking
but
only
when
it
can
be
sold
as
cheaply
as
gas
will
its
use
in
the
home
become
general
the
selection
of
a
stove
to
be
used
for
cooking
depends
on
the
fuel
that
is
to
be
used
and
the
fuel
in
turn
depends
on
the
locality
in
which
a
person
lives
however
as
the
fuel
that
is
the
most
convenient
and
easily
obtained
is
usually
the
cheapest
it
is
the
one
to
be
selected
for
the
cost
of
the
cooked
dish
may
be
greatly
increased
by
the
use
of
fuel
that
is
too
expensive
in
cooking
every
fuel
should
be
made
to
do
its
maximum
amount
of
work
because
waste
of
fuel
also
adds
materially
to
the
cost
of
cooking
and
besides
it
often
causes
great
inconvenience
for
example
cooking
on
a
stove
with
a
fire
that
instead
of
being
held
in
the
oven
and
the
lids
overheats
the
kitchen
and
burns
out
the
stove
not
only
wastes
fuel
and
material
but
also
taxes
the
temper
of
the
person
who
is
doing
the
work
from
what
has
just
been
said
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
a
knowledge
of
fuels
and
apparatus
for
producing
heat
will
assist
materially
in
the
economical
production
of
food
provided
of
course
it
is
applied
to
the
best
advantage
coal
and
coke
varieties
of
possibly
the
most
common
fuel
used
for
cooking
is
coal
this
fuel
comes
in
two
varieties
namely
or
and
or
their
relative
cost
depends
on
the
locality
the
kind
of
stove
and
an
intelligent
use
of
both
stove
and
fuel
hard
coal
costs
much
more
in
some
places
than
soft
coal
but
it
burns
more
slowly
and
evenly
and
gives
off
very
little
smoke
soft
coal
heats
more
rapidly
than
hard
coal
but
it
produces
considerable
smoke
and
makes
a
fire
that
does
not
last
so
long
unless
a
stove
is
especially
constructed
for
soft
coal
it
should
not
be
used
for
this
purpose
because
the
burning
of
soft
coal
will
wear
it
out
in
a
short
time
the
best
plan
is
to
use
each
variety
of
coal
in
a
stove
especially
constructed
for
it
but
if
a
housewife
finds
that
she
must
at
times
do
otherwise
she
should
realize
that
a
different
method
of
management
and
care
of
the
stove
is
demanded
sizes
of
as
the
effect
of
coal
on
the
stove
must
be
taken
into
consideration
in
the
buying
of
fuel
so
the
different
sizes
of
hard
coal
must
be
known
before
the
right
kind
can
be
selected
the
sizes
known
as
and
which
range
from
about
to
inches
in
diameter
are
intended
for
a
furnace
and
should
not
be
used
in
the
kitchen
stove
for
cooking
purposes
some
persons
who
know
how
to
use
the
size
of
coal
known
as
which
is
about
to
inch
in
diameter
like
that
kind
whereas
others
prefer
the
size
called
which
is
about
inch
to
inches
in
diameter
in
reality
a
mixture
of
these
two
if
properly
used
makes
the
best
and
most
easily
regulated
kitchen
coal
fire
quality
of
in
addition
to
knowing
the
names
prices
and
uses
of
the
different
kinds
of
coal
the
housewife
should
be
able
to
distinguish
poor
coal
from
good
coal
in
fact
proper
care
should
be
exercised
in
all
purchasing
for
the
person
who
understands
the
quality
of
the
thing
to
be
purchased
will
be
more
likely
to
get
full
value
for
the
money
paid
than
the
one
who
does
not
about
coal
it
should
be
understood
that
good
hard
coal
has
a
glossy
black
color
and
a
bright
surface
whereas
poor
coal
contains
slaty
pieces
the
quality
of
coal
can
also
be
determined
from
the
ash
that
remains
after
it
is
burned
large
chunks
or
great
quantities
of
ash
indicate
a
poor
quality
of
coal
and
fine
powdery
ash
a
good
quality
of
course
even
if
the
coal
is
of
the
right
kind
poor
results
are
often
brought
about
by
the
bad
management
of
a
fire
whether
in
a
furnace
or
a
stove
large
manufacturing
companies
whose
business
depends
considerably
on
the
proper
kind
of
fuel
buy
coal
by
the
heat
units
that
is
according
to
the
quantity
of
heat
it
will
give
off
and
at
some
future
time
this
plan
may
have
to
be
followed
in
the
private
home
unless
some
other
fuel
is
provided
in
the
meantime
mixed
with
poor
coal
are
certain
unburnable
materials
that
melt
and
stick
together
as
it
burns
and
form
what
are
known
as
clinkers
are
very
troublesome
because
they
often
adhere
to
the
stove
grate
or
the
lining
of
the
firebox
they
generally
form
during
the
burning
of
an
extremely
hot
fire
but
the
usual
temperature
of
a
kitchen
fire
does
not
produce
clinkers
unless
the
coal
is
of
a
very
poor
quality
mixing
oyster
shells
with
coal
of
this
kind
often
helps
to
prevent
their
formation
another
fuel
that
is
sometimes
used
for
cooking
is
coke
formerly
coke
was
a
in
the
manufacture
of
illuminating
gas
but
now
it
is
manufactured
from
coal
for
use
as
a
fuel
because
of
the
nature
of
its
composition
coke
produces
a
very
hot
fire
and
is
therefore
favorable
for
rapid
cooking
such
as
broiling
however
it
is
used
more
extensively
in
hotels
and
institutions
than
in
kitchens
where
cooking
is
done

where
the
piping
of
gas
into

is
possible
it
is
used
extensively
of
the
two
kinds
artificial
gas
produces
the

heat
also
it
is
the
most
expensive
usually
costing
two

as
much
as
natural
gas
both
are
very
cheap
however
considering
their
convenience
as
a
kitchen
fuel
heat
from
gas
is
obtained
by
merely
turning
it
on
and
igniting
it
as
with
a
lighted
match
its
consumption
can
be
stopped
at
once
by
closing
off
the
supply
or
it
can
be
regulated
as
desired

in
this
way
made
to
give
the
exact

required
for
the
method
of

adopted
neither

admit
the
right
amount
of

and
no
ashes
nor
refuse
remain
to
be
disposed
of
after
gas
has
been
burned
because
gas
is
so
easily
handled
good
results
can
be
obtained
by
those
who
have
had
very
little
experience
in
using
it
and
with
study
and
practice
results
become
uniform
and
gas
proves
to
be
an
economical
fuel
measurement
of
gas

and
a
definite
price
is
charged
for
each
cubic

to
determine
the
quantity
used
it
is
passed
through
what
is
called
a
meter
which
measures
as
the
gas
burns
it
is
important
that
each
housewife
be
able
to
read
the
amount
registered
by
the
meter
so
that
she
can
compare
her
gas
bill
with
the

thus
determine

therefore
put
these

is
cubic

subtract

will
give
cubic

or
the
quantity

since
gas
costs

the

such

they
contain

be
liberated
kerosene
in
communities
where
gas
is
not
available
kerosene
which
is
produced
by
the
refinement
of
petroleum
is
used
extensively
as
a
fuel
for
cooking
especially
in
hot
weather
when
the
use
of
a
coal
or
a
wood
stove
adds
materially
to
the
discomfort
of
the
person
who
does

kerosene
is
burned
in
stoves
especially
designed
for
its
use
and
while
it
is
a
cheap
fuel
it
is
not
always
the
same
in
quality
it
contains
water
at
all
times
but
sometimes
the
proportion
of
water
is
greater
than
at
others
the
greater
the
amount
of

the
less
fuel
will
be
contained
in

the
quality

kerosene
can
be
determined
by
checking
up
the

will
burn
on
a
specified
quantity
of
each
new
purchase
of
it
another
product
of
the
refinement
of
petroleum
is
however
it
is
not
used
so
extensively
for
fuel
as
kerosene
because
it
is
more
dangerous
and
more
expensive
electricity
the
use
of
electricity
for
supplying
heat
for
cooking
is
very
popular
in
some
homes
especially
those
which
are
properly
wired
because
of
its
convenience
and
cleanliness
and
the
fact
that
the
heat
it
produces
can
be
applied
direct
the
first
electrical
cooking
apparatus
was
introduced
at
the
time
of
the
world
fair
in
chicago
in
and
since
that
time
rapid
advancement
has
been
made
in
the
production
of
suitable
apparatus
for
cooking
electrically
electricity
would
undoubtedly
be
in
more
general
use
today
if
it
were
possible
to
store
it
in
the
same
way
as
artificial
gas
but
as
yet
no
such
method
has
been
devised
and
its
cost
is
therefore
greater
electricity
is
generated
in
large
power
plants
and
as
it
is
consumed
in
the
home
for
lighting
and
cooking
it
passes
through
a
meter
which
indicates
the
quantity
used
in
much
the
same
manner
as
a
gas
meter
it
will
be
well
therefore
to
understand
the
way
in
which
an
electric
meter
is
read
so
that
the
bills
for
electricity
can
be
checked
reading
an

an
electric
meter

is
similar
in
appearance
to
a

consists
of
three

four
dials

are
placed
side

or
in
the
shape
of
an
arc
in
the
usual
type
which
is
shown
in

consists
of
four
dials
placed
side

each
one
of
the
dials
contains
ten

indicator
that
passes
over
numbers
ranging
from

show
the
amount

the
numbers
on
the

represent
a
term
meaning
the

resulting
from

watt
which
is
the
practical
unit
of
electrical
power
for

the

numbers
read
the
number
that
it
is
leaving
for
example
in
fig
the
indicator
in
the
dial
points
to

therefore
this
number
should
be
put
down
first
in
the
second
dial
the
hand
lies
between
and

as
it
is
leaving
this
number
should
be
read

be
read
for
this

placed
directly
before
the

read
for
the
first

second
dials
thus
on
the
fourth
and
last
dial
the
indicator
is
between

therefore
which
is
the
number
it
is
leaving
should
be
read
and
used
as

first
figure
in
the
entire
reading
which

has
been
ascertained
it
is
a
simple
matter
to
determine
the
electricity
consumed
since
the
last
reading
and
the
amount
of
the
bill
for
instance
assume
that
a
meter
registers
the

and
that
at

previous
reading
it
registered
merely
subtract
the
previous

from
the
last
one
which
will
give
or
the
number
of
from
which
the

the

to
x
or
principle
of
stoves
before
stoves
for
cooking
came
into
use
in
the
home
food
was
cooked
in
open
fireplaces
even
when
wood
was
the
only
fuel
known
a
stove
for
burning
it
called
the
franklin
stove
was
invented
by
benjamin
franklin
but
not
until
coal
came
into
use
as
fuel
were
iron
stoves
made
for
a
long
time
stoves
were
used
mainly
for
heating
purposes
as
many
housewives
preferred
to
cook
at
the
open
fireplace
however
this
method
of
cooking
has
practically
disappeared
and
a
stove
of
some
kind
is
in
use
for
cooking
in
every
home
for
each
fuel
in
common
use
there
are
many
specially
constructed
stoves
each
having
some
advantageous
feature
yet
all
stoves
constructed
for
the
same
fuel
are
practically
the
same
in
principle
in
order
that
fuel
will
burn
and
produce
heat
it
must
have
air
because
fuel
whether
it
is
wood
coal
or
gas
is
composed
largely
of
and
air
largely
of
and
it
is
the
rapid
union
of
these
two
chemical
elements
that
produces
heat
therefore
in
order
that
each
stove
may
work
properly
some
way
in
which
to
furnish
air
for
the
fire
in
the
firebox
must
be
provided
for
this
reason
every
stove
for
cooking
contains
passageways
for
air
and
is
connected
with
a
chimney
which
contains
a
flue
or
passage
that
leads
to
the
outer
air
when
the
air
in
a
stove
becomes
heated
it
rises
and
as
it
ascends
cold
air
rushes
through
the
passageways
of
the
stove
to
take
its
place
it
is
the
flue
however
that
permits
of
the
necessary
draft
and
carries
off
unburned
gases
at
times
it
is
necessary
to
regulate
the
amount
of
air
that
enters
and
in
order
that
this
may
be
done
each
stove
is
provided
with
these
devices
are
located
in
the
air
passages
and
they
are
so
designed
as
to
close
off
the
air
or
allow
the
desired
amount
to
enter
by
means
of
these
dampers
it
is
possible
also
to
force
the
heat
around
the
stove
oven
against
the
top
of
the
stove
or
up
the
chimney
flue
a
knowledge
of
the
ways
in
which
to
manipulate
these
dampers
is
absolutely
necessary
if
correct
results
are
to
be
obtained
from
a
stove
the
flue
however
should
receive
due
consideration
if
a
stove
is
to
give
its
best
service
the
flue
in
addition
to
being
well
constructed
should
be
free
from
obstructions
and
kept
in
good
condition
indeed
the
stove
is
often
blamed
for
doing
unsatisfactory
work
when
the
fault
is
really
with
the
flue
probably
one
of
the
most
important
things
considered
in
the
construction
of
stoves
is
the
economizing
of
fuel
for
ever
since
the
days
of
the
fireplace
there
has
been
more
or
less
of
a
tendency
to
save
fuel
for
cooking
and
as
the
various
kinds
grow
scarcer
and
consequently
more
expensive
the
economical
use
of
fuel
becomes
a
necessity
while
most
stoves
for
cooking
purposes
are
so
constructed
as
to
save
fuel
many
of
them
do
not
especially
if
the
method
of
caring
for
them
is
not
understood
any
housewife
however
can
economize
in
the
use
of
fuel
if
she
will
learn
how
the
stove
she
has
must
be
operated
and
this
can
be
done
by
following
closely
the
directions
that
come
with
the

building
a
coal
to
build
a
coal
fire
is
a
simple
matter
so
that
the
draft
will
be
right
for
rapid
combustion
it
is
first
necessary
to
close
the
dampers
and
to
open
the
bottom
damper
and
the
chimney

with
these
dampers
arranged
place
crushed
paper
or
shavings
on

grate
then
on
top
of
the
paper
or
shavings
place
kindling
and
on
top
of
the
kindling
put
a
small
quantity
of
coal
be
careful
to
place
the
fuel
on
the
grate
loosely
enough
to
permit
currents
of
air
to
pass
through
it
because
it
will
not
burn
readily
if
it
is
closely
packed
light
the
fire
by
inserting
a
flame
from
below
when
this
is
done
the
flame
will
rise
and
ignite
the
kindling
and
this
in
turn
will
cause
the
coal
to
take
fire
when
the
fire
is
burning
well
close
the
dampers
and
so
that
the
fuel
will
not
burn
too
rapidly
and
the
heat
will
surround
the
oven
instead
of
passing
up
the
chimney
also
before
too
much
of
the
first
supply
of
coal
is
burned
out
add
a
new
supply
but
be
sure
that
the
coal
is
sufficiently
ignited
before
the
new
supply
is
added
so
as
not
to
smother
the
fire
if
only
a
thin
layer
is
added
each
time
this
danger
will
be
removed
experience
has
proved
that
the
best
results
are
secured
if
the
fire
is
built
only
inches
high
when
hot
coals
come
near
the
top
of

stove
the
lids
are
likely
to
warp
and
crack
from

will
not
be
done
any
more

another
thing
to
avoid

coolest
part
since
the
heated
air
does
not
reach
this
place
directly

that
the
top

shake

should
be
taken
however
to
use
sufficient
coal
in
banking
the
fire
so
that
when

the
arrangement
of

much
the

one
just
described
but
it
is
so
constructed
that
the
oil
which

also
stored
in
a
tank
at
the
side
flows
into
what
is
called
a
burner
bowl

from
this
bowl
up
through
a
perforated
chimney

quantity
of
oil
used
being
regulated
by
a
valve
attached
to
each
bowl
the
burners
of
kerosene
stoves
are
lighted
by
applying
a
match
just
as
the
burners
of
a
gas
stove
are
lighted
in
some
stoves
especially
those
of
the
wickless
type
the
burners
are
so
constructed
that
the
flame
can
rise
to
only
a
certain
height
this
is
a
good
feature
as
it
prevents
the
flame
from
gradually
creeping
up
and
smoking

common
occurrence
in

gives
the
most

a
yellow
flame
which

given
off

some
stoves
produces
more
or
less
soot
and
consequently
makes
it
harder
to
keep
the
stove
clean
glass
containers
are
better
than
metal
containers
because
the
water
that
is
always
present
in
small
quantities
in
kerosene
is
apt
to
rust
the
metal
container
and
cause
it
to
leak
to
prevent
the
accumulation
of
dirt
as
well
as
the
disagreeable
odor
usually
present
when
an
oil
stove
is
used
the
burners
should
be
removed
frequently
and
boiled
in
a
solution
of
washing
soda
also
if
a

is
used
the
charred
portion
should
be
rubbed
from

the

must
not

each

in
fact
the
wrong

this

possess
a

she
uses

the
proper

as

but
before
she
starts
to
cook
the
beginner
should
endeavor
to
plan
definitely
what
must
be
provided
she
should
likewise
remember
that
the
use
of
an
unnecessary
number
of
utensils
not
only
will
increase
the
labor
involved
in
preparing
a

but
will
affect
considerably
the
amount
of
work
required
to
clear
them
away
and

them
after

is
done
the
materials
of
which
cooking
utensils
are
made
as
well
as
their
shape

size
have
also
a
great
bearing
on
the
success
with
which
cooking
may
be
done
as
no

for
all

they
are
made
of
various
materials
such
as
wood
tin
glass
enamel
aluminum
sheet
iron
and
earthenware
in
the
purchase
of
a
utensil
therefore
it
is
well
to
have
in
mind
the
use
to
which
the
utensil
will
be
put
and
then
to
select
one
that
is
made
of
durable
material
that
can
be
easily
cleaned
and
that
will
not
affect
the
food
that
is
cooked
in
it
likewise
the
shape
of
the
utensil
should
receive
consideration
for
much
depends
on
it
to
be
satisfactory
a
utensil
should
be
without
seams
or
curved
edges
because
it
is
difficult
to
remove
particles
of
food
that
collect
in
such
places
a
vessel
that
is
hard
to
wash
should
be
avoided
and
one
that
will
tip
easily
is
not
desirable
either
the
size
of
utensils
must
be
determined
by
the
number
of
persons
for
whom
food
is
to
be
cooked
for
the
amount
of
food
to
be
prepared
indicates
whether
a
large
or
a
small
utensil
should
be
selected
on
the
other
hand
the
length
of
time
required
for
foods
to
cook
depends
to
a
large
extent
on
the
size
and
shape
of
the
utensil
when
food
is
to
be
cooked
a
long
time
a
deep
vessel
with
a
comparatively
small
surface
exposed
for
evaporation
should
be
chosen
but
for
quick
cooking
use
should
be
made
of
a
shallow
utensil
that
will
allow
a
great
deal
of
surface
to
be
exposed
as
the
evaporation
will
be
accomplished
more
rapidly
in
furnishing
a
kitchen
it
is
well
to
begin
with
a
few
essential
utensils
of
the
best
quality
that
can
be
obtained
and
then
as
needed
to
add
other
utensils
to
the
equipment
materials
used
for
utensils
because
of
the
properties
of
aluminum
this
metal
is
used
extensively
for
cooking
utensils
it
is
more
costly
than
most
of
the
materials
employed
for
this
purpose
but
while
the
first
cost
of
aluminum
pans
and
kettles
may
seem
large
the
extra
expense
is
justified
by
the
durability
of
the
utensils
they
last
much
longer
than
utensils
made
of
many
other
materials
for
when
aluminum
is
hammered
and
rolled
it
becomes
extremely
hard
some
aluminum
utensils
are
very
thin
and
since
they
melt
and
dent
very
easily
they
are
suitable
for
only
light
careful
handling
although
heavier
aluminum
utensils
are
more
expensive
than
the
lighter
ones
on
account
of
the
metal
required
and
the
manufacturing
process
involved
they
are
harder
and
more
durable
cast
aluminum
is
used
for
large
vessels
such
as
those
required
in
institutions
where
large
quantities
of
food
are
cooked
and
where
pots
and
kettles
are
subjected
to
extremely
hard
wear
but
this
is
the
most
expensive
kind
for
in
order
to
make
the
aluminum
hard
enough
for
casting
some
harder
metal
must
be
mixed
with
it
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
aluminum
is
that
it
is
not
always
easy
to
clean
but
this
is
overbalanced
by
the
fact
that
foods
do
not
burn
so
readily
in
aluminum
utensils
as
in
other
kinds
since
the
heat
is
evenly
distributed
by
this
metal
good

cooking
utensils
are
desirable
for
some
purposes
and
are
only
moderately
expensive
utensils
made
of
enamel
are
not
so
durable
as
those
made
of
metal
because
excessive
heat
or
a
sharp
blow
will
cause
the
enamel
to
chip

in

preliminary
preparation
before
foods
that
require
cooking
are
cooked
or
before
foods
that
are
to
be
eaten
raw
are
served
they
must
be
properly
prepared
for
their
palatability
and
their
value
as
food
depend
considerably
on
the
way
in
which
they
are
made
ready
for
cooking
or
for
eating
of
course
the
way
in
which
food
should
be
prepared
will
depend
on
how
it
is
to
be
served
but
in
any
event
all
foods
for
the
sake
of
cleanliness
must
first
be
washed
with
water
or
wiped
with
a
clean
damp
cloth
the
ways
in
which
vegetables
and
fruits
are
made
ready
for
cooking
vary
sometimes
such
foods
are
cooked
with
the
skins
on
and
sometimes
certain
vegetables
such
as
new
potatoes
young
carrots
and
parsnips
vegetable
oysters
are
made
ready
in
an
economical
way
by
scraping
off
their
skins
with
a
knife
vegetables
are
also
peeled
and
when
this
is
done
a
very
sharp
knife
with
a
thin
blade
should
be
used
and
as
little
of
the
food
removed
as
possible
still
another
way
of
removing
the
skins
of
such
foods
as
tomatoes
nuts
and
some
fruits
is
by
in
this
process
the
skins
are
loosened
so
that
they
may
be
removed
easily
either
by
immersing
the
foods
in
boiling
water
or
by
pouring
boiling
water
over
them
and
allowing
them
to
stand
in
the
water
for
a
few
minutes
but
not
long
enough
to
soften
them
blanching
used
in
this
sense
should
not
be
confused
with
the
same
word
when
it
means
to
take
color
out
and
has
reference
to
a
process
of
bleaching
only
when
the
word
means
to
remove
the
covering
of
can
it
be
applied
to
the
peeling
of
tomatoes
fruits
and
nuts
vegetables
and
fruits
may
be
cooked
whole
or
they
may
be
cut
into
chunks
or
pieces
or
into
slices
in
order
to
get
meats
ready
for
cooking
it
is
necessary
to
wipe
them
clean
and
usually
to
trim
off
all
unnecessary
bone
fat
and
skin
meats
may
be
cooked
in
large
pieces
or
small
pieces
or
they
may
be
ground
depending
on
the
cooking
process
to
be
used
before
cooking
poultry
and
fish
they
should
be
thoroughly
cleaned
and
then
trimmed
and
cut
to
suit
the
cooking
process
chosen
if
desired
the
bones
may
be
removed
from
poultry
or
fish
before
cooking
and
sometimes
it
is
advantageous
to
do
so
cream
and
raw
eggs
may
be
whipped
or
beaten
light
before
they
are
served
or
cooked
and
after
such
foods
as

mixing
of
food
ingredients
processes
involved
in
in
cookery
the
mixing
of
ingredients
is
done
for
several
purposes
to
produce
a
certain
texture
to
give
a
smoothness
or
creaminess
to
a
mixture
or
to
impart
lightness
various
processes
are
involved
in
the
mixing
of
ingredients
and
the
results
that
are
accomplished
depend
entirely
on
the
method
that
is
selected
the
most
important
of
these
processes
with
brief
explanations
of
what
they
mean
follow
beating
is
a
rapid
motion
that
picks
up
material
from
the
bottom
and
mixes
it
with
that
nearer
the
surface
it
is
done
with
a
spoon
a
fork
an
egg
whip
or
if
the
mixture
is
thin
with
a
rotary
egg
beater
sometimes
beating
is
done
for
the
purpose
of
incorporating
air
and
thus
making
the
mixture
light
stirring
is
usually
done
with
a
spoon
and
is
accomplished
by
moving
the
spoon
in
circles
around
and
around
through
ingredients
contained
in
a
pan
or
a
bowl
this
is
the
method
that
is
generally
applied
to
the
simple
mixing
of
ingredients
folding
is
a
careful
process
whereby
beaten
egg
or
whipped
cream
is
added
to
a
mixture
without
destroying
its
lightness
it
is
accomplished
by
placing
the
egg
or
cream
on
top
of
a
mixture
in
a
bowl
or
a
pan
and
then
passing
a
spoon
down
through
both
and
bringing
up
a
spoonful
of
the
mixture
and
placing
it
on
top
this
motion
is
repeated
until
the
two
are
well
blended
but
this
result
should
be
accomplished
with
as
few
strokes
as
possible
rubbing
is
done
by
pressing
materials
against
the
side
of
a
bowl
with
the
back
of
a
spoon
this
is
the
process
that
is
applied
when
butter
and
other
fats
are
to
be
mixed
with
such
dry
ingredients
as
sugar
and
flour
creaming
consists
in
continuing
the
rubbing
process
until
the
texture
becomes
soft
and
smooth
and
is
of
a
creamy
consistency
is
a
method
used
to
combine
butter
with
flour
when
it
is
desired
to
have
the
butter
remain
hard
or
in
small
pieces
it
is
done
by
chopping
the
butter
into
the
flour
with
a
knife
sifting
is
shaking
or
stirring
material
through
a
sifter
having
a
fine
wire
mesh
it
is
done
to
remove
foreign
or
coarse
material
to
impart
lightness
or
to
mix
dry
ingredients
together
ricing
is
a
process
whereby
certain
cooked
foods
such
as
fruits
vegetables
meats
and
fish
may
be
reduced
to
the
form
of
a
purée
this
result
is
accomplished
by
forcing
the
cooked
material
through
a
ricer
application
of
mixing
in
applying
the
various
mixing
processes
it
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
good
results
depend
considerably
on
the
order
of
mixing
as
well
as
on
the
deftness
and
thoroughness
with
which
each
process
is
performed
this
fact
is
clearly
demonstrated
in
a
cake
in
which
the
butter
and
sugar
have
not
been
actually
creamed
for
such
a
cake
will
not
have
the
same
texture
as
one
in
which
the
creaming
has
been
done
properly
it
is
also
shown
in
angel
food
or
sunshine
cake
for
the
success
of
such
a
cake
depends
largely
on
the
skill
employed
in
folding
in
the
whites
of
eggs
or
in
beating
the
yolks
on
the
other
hand
the
lightness
of
pastry
and
the
tenderness
of
cookies
depend
on
how
each
is
rolled
out
and
the
kneading
of
bread
is
a
process
that
demonstrates
that
many
things
can
be
learned
by
actually
doing
them
as
progress
is
made
with
these
cookery
lessons
therefore
the
application
of
the
mixing
processes
should
not
be
overlooked
beginners
in
cookery
owing
possibly
to
the
fact
that
at
first
they
can
not
handle
soft
material
skilfully
are
liable
to
make
the
mistake
of
getting
the
ingredients
too
stiff
yet
no
beginner
need
feel
the
least
bit
discouraged
for
ability
in
this
direction
comes
with
experience
indeed
just
as
skill
in
sewing
embroidering
and
other
processes
comes
about
by
practice
and
persistent
effort
so
will
come
skill
in
cooking
measuring
uniform
results
in
cookery
depend
on
accurate
measurement
of
course
there
are
some
cooks
and
good
ones
too
who
claim
that
they
do
not
measure
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
have
through
long
experience
developed
a
judgment
or
sense
of
measurement
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
as
if
they
actually
did
measure
still
even
these
cooks
can
not
be
absolutely
sure
of
securing
as
satisfactory
results
time
after
time
as
are
likely
to
follow
the
employment
of
a
more
accurate
method
therefore
to
secure
the
best
results
every
kitchen
should
be
supplied
with
the
proper
measuring
utensils
which
are
scales
a
measuring
cup
and
a
set
of
measuring
spoons
or
a
standard
tablespoon
and
a
standard
teaspoon
illustration
fig
in
fig
is
shown
the
type
of
scales
generally
included
in
the
kitchen
equipment
the
material
to
be
weighed
is
placed
on
the
platform
at
the
top
and
the
weight
of
it
is
indicated
on
the
dial
by
a
pointer
or
hand
sometimes
these
scales
are
provided
with
a
scoop
in
which
loose
materials
may
be
placed
in
weighing
such
scales
furnish
a
correct
means
not
only
of
measuring
materials
but
of
verifying
the
weights
of
foods
from
the
market
the
butcher
shop
or
the
grocery
to
use
them
properly
the
housewife
should
learn
to
balance
them
exactly
and
when
she
is
weighing
articles
she
should
always
allow
for
the
weight
of
the
container
or
receptacle
even
if
it
is
only
the
paper
that
holds
the
food
illustration
fig
measuring
weighing
the
articles
called
for
in
a
recipe
is
often
a
less
convenient
method
than
measuring
therefore
in
the
preparation
of
foods
measuring
is
more
often
resorted
to
than
weighing
as
accuracy
in
measurement
is
productive
of
the
best
results
it
is
necessary
that
all
measures
be
as
accurate
and
definite
as
possible
for
measuring
the
ingredients
called
for
in
recipes
use
is
generally
made
of
a
measuring
cup
like
that
shown
in
fig
such
a
cup
is
designed
to
hold
gills
or
pint
and
it
is
marked
to
indicate
thirds
and
quarters
so
that
it
may
be
used
for
recipes
of
all
kinds
if
a
liquid
is
to
be
measured
with
such
a
cup
it
should
be
filled
to
the
brim
but
if
dry
material
is
to
be
measured
with
it
the
material
should
be
heaped
up
in
the
cup
with
a
spoon
and
then
scraped
level
with
a
knife
in
the
manner
shown
in
fig
in
case
fractions
or
parts
of
a
cup
are
to
be
measured
the
cup
should
be
placed
level
and
stationary
and
then
filled
evenly
to
the
mark
indicated
on
the
cup
itself
many
times
it
will
be
found
more
convenient
to
measure
dry

convenient
in
a

however
if
it
is
impossible
to
obtain
such
a

a
teaspoon
and
a
tablespoon
of
standard
size
will
answer
for
measuring
purposes
three

a
knife
in
the
manner
shown

contents
pushed
off

precautions
to
observe
in
in
measuring
some
of
the
materials
used
in
the
preparation
of
foods
certain
points
concerning
them
should
receive
attention
for
instance
all
powdered
materials
such
as
flour
must
first
be
sifted
as
the
amount
increases
upon
sifting
it
being
definitely
known
that
a
cupful
of
unsifted
flour
will
measure
about
cupfuls
after
it
is
sifted
lumps
such
as
those
which
form
in
salt
and
sugar
should
be
thoroughly
crushed
before
measuring
if
this
is
not
done
accurate
measurements
can
not
be
secured
because
lumps
of
such
ingredients
are
more
compact
than
the
loose
material
butter
and
other
fats
should
be
tightly
packed
into
the
measure
and
if
the
fat
is
to
be
melted
in
order
to
carry
out
a
recipe
it
should
be
melted
before
it
is
measured
anything
measured
in
a
cup
should
be
poured
into
the
cup
that
is
the
cup
should
not
be
filled
by
dipping
it
into
the
material
nor
by
drawing
it
through
the
material
illustration
fig
tables
of
weights
and
as
foods
are
sold
by
weight
and
by
measure
and
as
recipes
always
call
for
certain
weights
and
measures
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
every
person
engaged
in
the
purchase
and
preparation
of
foods
should
be
familiar
with
the
tables
of
weights
and
measures
in
common
use
for
such
purposes
in
the
united
states
and
practically
all
other
countries
in
addition
it
will
be
well
to
have
a
knowledge
of
relative
weights
and
measures
so
as
to
be
in
a
position
to
use
these
tables
to
the
best
advantage
the
table
used
ordinarily
for
weighing
foods
is
the
table
of
avoirdupois
weight
another
table
of
weights
called
the
table
of
is
used
by
goldsmiths
and
jewelers
for
weighing
precious
metals
it
should
not
be
confused
with
avoirdupois
weight
however
because
its
pound
contains
only
ounces
whereas
the
avoirdupois
pound
contains
ounces
the
table
of
avoirdupois
weight
together
with
the
abbreviations
of
the
terms
used
in
it
is

and
then
carried
on
with
systematic

by
following
such
a

the
order
of
work
here
outlined
will
serve
to
make
clear
the
way
in
which
cooking
processes
can
be
carried
out
satisfactorily
first
read
the
quantity
and
kind
of
ingredients
listed
in
the
recipe
and
study
carefully
the
method
by
which
they
are
to
be
prepared
and
combined
in
so
doing
determine
whether
the
dish
is
too
expensive
and
whether
the
amounts
called
for
will
make
a
dish
sufficient
in
size
for
the
number
of
persons
to
be
served
if
they
are
too
large
carefully
divide
them
to
make
the
right
quantity
if
they
are
too
small
multiply
them
to
make
them
enough
the
heat
itself
which
plays
such
an
important
part
in
cooking
should
receive
attention
at
the
proper
time
if
the
fuel
to
be
used
is
coal
or
wood
and
baking
is
to
be
done
build
the
fire
long
enough
before
it
is
needed
so
that
it
will
be
burning
evenly
and
steadily
then
while
the
recipe
is
being
prepared
provided
it
is
to
be
baked
regulate
the
heat
of
the
oven
if
gas
or
kerosene
is
to
be
used
light
it
after
the
recipe
is
read
and
regulate
it
during
the
measuring
and
mixing
of
the
ingredients
before
proceeding
to
prepare
a
dish
clear
enough
working
space
for
the
utensils
that
are
to
be
used
as
well
as
for
carrying
on
the
various
operations
without
feeling
crowded
then
on
the
cleared
space
place
the
necessary
measuring
utensils
such
as
a
measuring
cup
a
knife
a
teaspoon
and
a
tablespoon
select
a
bowl
or
a
pan
for
mixing
a
spoon
for
stirring
and
when
needed
an
egg
whip
or
beater
for
eggs
and
separate
bowls
in
which
to
beat
them
choose
the
utensil
in
which
the
mixture
is
to
be
cooked
and
if
necessary
grease
it
during
the
process
of
preparing
the
dish
measure
accurately
all
the
ingredients
to
be
used
and
check
them
up
with
the
recipe
so
as
to
be
sure
that
none
are
missing
and
that
each
one
is
in
its
proper
amount
if
all
these
steps
are
accurately
taken
the
mixing
which
is
the
next
step
can
be
accomplished
quickly
and
without
error
with
all
the
ingredients
properly
combined
the
mixture
is
ready
for
the
last
step
the
cooking
or
the
baking
this
must
be
done
with
the
utmost
care
or
an
otherwise
properly
prepared

may
be
spoiled
table
for
cooking
foods
so
that
the
beginner
in
cookery
may
form
a
definite
idea
of
the
length
of
time
required
to
cook
certain
foods
there
is
presented
here
what
is
commonly
known
as
a
time
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
time
required
to
cook
food
is
influenced
by
many
factors
for
instance
the
age
of
vegetables
and
fruits
very
largely
determines
how
long
they
should
be
cooked
tough
meats
and
fowl
require
longer
cooking
than
tender
ones
and
the
heat
of
the
oven
has
much
to
do
with
the
length
of
time
required
for
cooking
especially
the
process
of
baking
or
roasting
therefore
while
this
time
table
will
prove
of
great
help
to
beginners
it
can
serve
only
as
a
guide
to
determine
whether
or
not
foods
have
been
cooked
long
enough
it
is
advisable
to
apply
the
proper
tests
which
are
given
later
in
discussing
the
various
foods
rather
than
to
depend
solely

care

reasons
for
care
although
as
has
been
explained
the
selection
and
preparation
of
foods
require
much
consideration
from
the
housewife
who
desires
to
get
good
results
in
cookery
there
is
still
one
thing
to
which
she
must
give
attention
if
she
would
keep
down
the
cost
of
living
and
that
is
the
care
of
food
unless
food
is
properly
taken
care
of
before
it
is
cooked
as
well
as
after
it
is
cooked
that
is
the
considerable
loss
is
liable
to
result
through
its
spoiling
or
decaying
both
uncooked
and
cooked
food
may
be
kept
wholesome
in
several
ways
but
before
these
are
discussed
it
may
be
well
to
look
into
the
causes
of
spoiling
with
these
causes
understood
the
methods
of
caring
for
foods
will
be
better
appreciated
and
the
results
in
buying
storing
and
handling
foods
will
be
more
satisfactory
to
come
to
a
knowledge
of
why
foods
spoil
it
will
be
well
to
note
that
nature
abounds
in
or
living
things
so
minute
as
to
be
invisible
to
the
naked
eye
these
are
known
to
science
as
and
and
they
are
comprised
of
and
a
knowledge
of
which
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
physician
and
the
farmer
as
well
as
the
housewife
just
in
what
ways
these
are
beneficial
to
the
farmer
and
the
physician
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
subject
of
cookery
but
in
the
household
their
influence
is
felt
in
three
ways
they
are
the
cause
of
the
decay
and
spoiling
of
foods
they
are
of
value
in
the
preparation
of
certain
foods
and
they
are
the
cause
of
contagious
diseases
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
while
some
microbes
are
undesirable
others
exert
a
beneficial
action
it
is
only
within
comparatively
recent
years
that
the
action
of
has
been
understood
it
is
now
definitely
known
that
these
minute
living
things
seize
every
possible
chance
to
attack
articles
of
food
and
produce
the
changes
known
as
fermentation
putrefaction
souring
and
decay
that
cause
fermentation
are
necessary
in
bread
making
and
vinegar
making
but
they
are
destructive
to
other
foods
as
for
example
those
which
are
canned
or
preserved
organisms
that
cause
putrefaction
are
needed
in
the
making
of
sauer
kraut
salt
rising
bread
and
cheese
molds
also
help
to
make
cheese
but
neither
these
nor
putrefactive
organisms
are
desirable
for
foods
other
than
those
mentioned
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
even
those
foods
which
require
in
their
making
are
constantly
in
danger
of
the
attacks
of
these
small
living
things
for
unless
something
is
done
to
retard
their
growth
they
will
cause
food
to
sour
or
decay
and
thus
become
unfit
for
consumption
some
foods
of
course
withstand
the
attacks
of
for
longer
periods
of
time
than
others
for
example
most
fruits
that
are
protected
by
an
unbroken
skin
will
under
the
right
conditions
keep
for
long
periods
of
time
but
berries
on
account
of
having
less
protective
covering
spoil
much
more
quickly
likewise
vegetables
without
skins
decay
faster
than
those
with
skins
because
they
have
no
protective
covering
and
contain
more
water
in
which
as
is
definitely
known
most
thrive
if
food
is
to
be
kept
from
decaying
the
housewife
must
endeavor
to
prevent
the
growth
of
and
she
can
best
accomplish
this
if
she
is
familiar
with
the
ways
in
which
they
work
it
is
for
this
reason
that
whether
she
possesses
a
scientific
knowledge
of
bacteria
or
not
an
understanding
of
some
practical
facts
concerning
why
food
spoils
and
how
to
keep
it
from
decaying
is
imperative
in
this
part
of
cookery
as
in
every
other
phase
it
is
the
reason
why
things
should
be
done
that
makes
all
that
relates
to
the
cooking
of
food
so
interesting
in
all
parts
of
the
work
there
are
scientific
facts
underlying
the
processes
and
the
more
the
housewife
learns
about
these
the
more
she
can
exercise
the
art
of
cookery
which
like
all
other
arts
depends
on
scientific
principles
methods
of
care
classification
as
has
been
pointed
out
it
is
not
the
mere
presence
of
that
causes
the
spoiling
of
food
but
their
constant
growth
therefore
to
keep
milk
from
souring
meat
from
spoiling
bread
from
molding
canned
fruit
from
fermenting
and
so
on
it
is
necessary
to
know
what
will
prevent
the
growth
of
these
minute
organisms
different
foods
require
different
treatment
some
foods
must
be
kept
very
cold
some
must
be
heated
or
cooked
others
must
be
dried
and
to
others
must
be
added
preservatives
an
unwarrantable
prejudice
has
been
raised
in
the
minds
of
many
persons
against
the
use
of
preservatives
but
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
term
is
not
properly
understood
in
this
use
it
means
anything
that
helps
to
preserve
or
keep
safe
the
food
to
which
it
is
added
sugar
salt
spices
and
vinegar
are
all
preservatives
and
are
added
to
food
as
much
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
it
as
for
seasoning
it
canning
and
drying
of
foods
among
the
common
methods
of
caring
for
foods
that
are
to
be
used
at
a
future
time
are
canning
and
drying
canning
which
is
discussed
fully
in
another
section
consists
in
preserving
sterile
foods
in
sealed
cans
or
jars
the
aim
in
canning
is
to
prevent
the
growth
of
and
to
do
this
the
process
known
as
that
is
the
destroying
of
bacteria
and
other
by
means
of
heat
is
resorted
to
canning
theories
are
different
now
from
what
they
were
in
former
times
for
example
housewives
formerly
made
heavy
rich
preserves
of
available
fruits
because
it
was
thought
that
sugar
must
be
used
in
large
quantities
in
order
to
keep
or
prevent
them
from
spoiling
while
it
is
true
that
the
sugar
assisted
science
has
since
proved
that
sterilizing
is
what
must
be
done
so
that
now
only
the
sugar
desired
for
sweetening
need
be
used
the
other
method
of
keeping
food
namely
drying
depends
for
its
success
on
the
fact
that
such
as
bacteria
can
not
grow
unless
they
have
a
considerable
quantity
of
moisture
or
water
molds
grow
on
cheese
bread
damp
cloth
or
paper
or
articles
that
contain
only
a
small
amount
of
moisture
but
bacteria
need
from
to
per
cent
of
water
in
food
in
order
to
grow
and
multiply
this
explains
why
in
high
altitudes
and
dry
climates
foods
keep
for
a
long
time
without
artificial
means
of
preservation
it
also
explains
why
the
housekeeper
dried
fruits
and
why
the
preservation
of
certain
meats
is
accomplished
by
the
combined
methods
of
smoking
and
drying
the
creosote
of
the
smoke
given
off
from
the
wood
used
in
this
process
acting
as
a
preservative
all
the
grains
which
are
very
dry
keep
for
long
periods
of
time
even
centuries
if
they
are
protected
from
the
moisture
of
the
air
peas
beans
and
lentils
as
well
as
dried
biscuits
and
crackers
are
all
examples
of
how
well
food
will
keep
when
little
or
no
moisture
is
present
keeping
foods
with
ice
although
as
has
just
been
pointed
out
moisture
is
required
for
the
growth
of
some
both
moisture
and
warmth
are
necessary
for
the
growth
of
most
of
the
organisms
that
cause
molding
putrefaction
and
fermentation
it
is
definitely
known
also
that
in
winter
or
in
cold
climates
food
can
be
kept
for
long
periods
of
time
without
any
apparent
change
in
fact
the
lower
the
temperature
the
less
likely
are
foods
to
spoil
although
freezing
renders
many
of
them
unfit
for
use
these
facts
are
what
led
up
to
the
scientific
truth
that
keeping
foods
dry
and
at
a
low
temperature
is
an
effective
and
convenient
method
of
preventing
them
from
spoiling
and
to
the
invention
of
the
refrigerator
and
other
devices
and
methods
for
the
cold
storage
of
foods
the
for
home
use
the
refrigerator
offers
the
most
convenient
means
of
keeping
foods
in
good
condition
as
is
well
known
it
is
a
device
that
by
means
of
air
cooled
by
the
melting
of
ice
or
in
some
other
manner
keeps
food
at
a
temperature
near
the
freezing
point
all
refrigerators
are
constructed
in
a
similar
manner
having
two
or
more
layers
of
wood
between
which
is
placed
an
insulating
material
such
as
cork
asbestos
or
mineral
wool
the
food
compartments
are
lined
with
tile
zinc
or
other
material
and
the
ice
compartment
is
usually
lined
with
metal
so
as
to
be
and
unbreakable
any
refrigerator
may
be
made
to
serve
the
purpose
of
preserving
food
effectively
if
it
is
well
constructed
the
ice
chamber
kept
as
full
of
ice
as
possible
and
the
housewife
knows
how
to
arrange
the
foods
in
the
food
chambers
to
the
best
advantage
the
construction
and
use
of
refrigerators
are
based
on
the
scientific
fact
that
air
expands
and
rises
when
it
becomes
warm
this
can
be
proved
by
testing
the
air
near
the
ceiling
of
a
room
for
no
matter
how
warm
it
is
near
the
floor
it
will
always
be
warmer
above
the
same
thing
occurs
in
a
refrigerator
as
air
comes
in
contact
with
the
ice
it
is
cooled
and
falls
and
the
warm
air
is
forced
up
thus
the
air
is
kept
in
constant
motion
or
circulation

many
refrigerators
are
built
with
the

compartment
on
one

as
in
the
refrigerator
illustrated
in

in
such
refrigerators
there
is
usually
a
small
food
compartment
directly
under
the
ice
chamber

this
is
the
coldest
place
in
the
refrigerator
here
should
be
stored
the
foods
that
need
special
care
or
that
absorb
odors
and
flavors
readily
such
as
milk
butter
cream
meat
because
at
this
place
the
air
which
circulates
in
the
manner
indicated
by
the
arrow
is
the
purest
the
foods
that
give

strong
enough

being
freed
from

in

shown
a
type
of
refrigerator
in
which
the
ice
chamber
or
compartment
extends
across
the
entire

this
type

so
built
as
to
produce
on
each
side
a
current
of
air
that
passes
down
from
the
ice
at
the
center
and
back
up
to
the
ice
near
the
outside
walls
as
shown
by

required
for

care
of
food
in
the
proper
placing
of
foods
in
a
refrigerator
is
extremely
important
but
certain
precautions
should
be
taken
with
regard
to
the
food
itself
cooked
foods
should
never
be
placed
in
the
refrigerator
without
first
allowing
them
to
cool
for
the
steam
given
off
when
a
dish
of
hot
food
comes
in
contact
with
the
cold
air
makes
the
refrigerator
damp
and
causes
an
undue
waste
of
ice
by
warming
the
air
all
dishes
containing
food
should
be
wiped
dry
and
carefully
covered
before
they
are
placed
in
the
refrigerator
so
as
to
keep
unnecessary
moisture
out
of
it
as
butter
and
milk
are
likely
to
become
contaminated
with
odors
given
off
by
other
foods
they
should
be
properly
protected
if
there
is
not
a
separate
compartment
in
which
to
keep
them
the
milk
bottles
should
always
be
closed
and
the
butter
carefully
wrapped
or
put
in
a
covered
receptacle
onions
cabbage
and
other
foods
with
strong
odors
when
placed
in
the
refrigerator
should
be
kept
in
tightly
closed
jars
or
dishes
so
that
the
odors
will
not
escape
before
fresh
fruits
and
perishable
vegetables
that
is
vegetables
that
decay
easily
are
put
into
the
refrigerator
they
should
be
carefully
looked
over
and
all
decayed
portions
removed
from
them
no
food
should
be
placed
in
the
ice
chamber
because
this
will
cause
the
ice
to
melt
unnecessarily
care
of
the
it
is
essential
that
all
parts
of
the
refrigerator
be
kept
scrupulously
clean
and
as
dry
as
possible
to
accomplish
this
nothing
should
be
allowed
to
spoil
in
it
and
anything
spilled
in
the
refrigerator
should
be
cleaned
out
immediately
the
foods
that
are
left
over
should
be
carefully
inspected
every
day
and
anything
not
likely
to
be
used
within
a
day
or
so
should
be
disposed
of
at
least
once
a
week
the
food
should
be
removed
from
all
compartments
the
racks
taken
out
the
drain
pipe
disconnected
and
each
part
thoroughly
washed
rinsed
with
boiling
water
and
dried
the
inside
of
the
refrigerator
should
likewise
be
washed
rinsed
and
wiped
dry
after
which
the
drain
pipe
should
be
connected
the
shelves
put
back
in
place
and
the
food
replaced
the
ice
chamber
of
the
refrigerator
should
also
be
cleaned
frequently
the
best
time
to
do
this
being
when
the
ice
has
melted
enough
to
be
lifted
out
conveniently
to
prevent
the
ice
from
melting
rapidly
when
it
is
out
of
the
refrigerator
it
may
be
wrapped
in
paper
or
a
piece
of
old
blanket
but
this
covering
must
be
removed
when
the
ice
is
replaced
in
the
chamber
in
order
to
allow
the
ice
to
melt
in
the
refrigerator
otherwise
it
would
be
impossible
to
chill
the
refrigerator
properly
the
temperature
remaining
the
same
as
that
outside
for
it
is
as
the
ice
gradually
melts
that
the
air
in
the
refrigerator
becomes
cool
of
course
every
effort
should
be
made
to
keep
the
ice
from
wasting
therefore
while
the
refrigerator
should
be
kept
in
a
convenient
place
it
should
not
be
exposed
to
too
great
heat
also
the
doors
should
be
kept
tightly
closed
and
as
has
already
been
explained
hot
foods
should
not
be
put
in
until
they
are
sufficiently
cooled
attention
must
be
given
to
the
care
of
the
refrigerator
for
only
when
it
is
clean
and
dry
can
the
growth
of
bacteria
that
attack
foods
be
prevented
keeping
foods
without
ice
while
a
refrigerator
simplifies
the
preserving
of
cooked
foods
and
those
subject
to
quick
decay
there
are
many
communities
in
which
it
is
not
possible
to
procure
ice
conveniently
thus
making
it
necessary
to
adopt
some
other
means
of
keeping
food
then
too
there
are
generally
quantities
of
foods
such
as
winter
vegetables
apples
that
can
not
be
stored
in
a
refrigerator
but
must
be
taken
care
of
properly
in
such
cases
the
method
of
storing
depends
to
a
certain
extent
on
conditions
on
many
farms
there
are
spring
houses
in
which
foods
may
be
stored
in
order
to
keep
them
cool
during
very
warm
weather
but
in
the
majority
of
homes
the
cellar
on
account
of
its
being
cool
is
utilized
for
the
storage
of
large
quantities
of
food
and
even
for
keeping
the
more
perishable
foods
when
ice
can
not
be
obtained

be
supplied

very
much

it
may
seem
unnecessary
to
give
much
attention
to
the
storing
of
foods
that
do
not
spoil
easily
but
there
are
good
reasons
why
such
foods
require
careful
storage
they
should
be
properly
cared
for
to
prevent
the
loss
of
flavor
by
exposure
to
the
air
to
prevent
the
absorption
of
moisture
which
produces
a
favorable
opportunity
for
the
growth
of
molds
and
to
prevent
the
attacks
of
insects
and
vermin
the
best
way
in
which
to
care
for
such
foods
is
to
store
them
in
tightly
closed
vessels
earthenware
and
glass
jars
lard
pails
coffee
and
cocoa
cans
all
carefully
cleaned
and
having
lids
to
fit
prove
to
be
very
satisfactory
receptacles
for
such
purposes
unless
coffee
tea
cocoa
spices
and
prepared
cereals
are
bought
in
cans
or
containers
they
should
be
emptied
from
the
original
packages
and
placed
in
jars
that
can
be
tightly
closed
so
that
they
will
not
deteriorate
by
being
exposed
to
the
air
or
moisture
for
convenience
and
economy
these
jars
or
cans
should
be
labeled
sugar
and
salt
absorb
moisture
and
form
lumps
when
exposed
to
the
air
and
they
too
should
be
properly
kept
a
tin
receptacle
is
the
best
kind
for
sugar
but
for
salt
an
earthenware
or
glass
vessel
should
be
used
it
is
not
advisable
to
put
these
foods
or
any
others
into
cupboards
in
paper
bags
because
foods
kept
in
this
way
make
disorderly
looking
shelves
and
are
easily
accessible
to
vermin
which
are
always
attracted
to
food
whenever
it
is
not
well
protected
canned
goods
bought
in
tin
cans
do
not
need
very
careful
storage
it
is
sufficient
to
keep
them
in
a
place
dry
enough
to
prevent
the
cans
from
rusting
foods
canned
in
glass
however
should
be
kept
where

therefore
wooden
bins
or
boxes
kept
in
a
dry
place
are
the
most
satisfactory
storing
of
semiperishable
foods
practically
all
vegetables
and
fruits
with
skins
may
be
regarded
as
semiperishable
foods
and
while
they
do
not
spoil
so
easily

some
foods
they
require
a
certain
amount
of
care

are
easily
kept

like
that

a
very
good
means
for
such
storage
it
is
of
course
economical
to
buy
potatoes
in
large
quantities
but
if
they
must
be
kept
under
conditions
that
will
permit
them
to
sprout
shrivel
rot
or
freeze
it
is
better
to
buy
only
a
small
quantity

some
time

deteriorate
less
however

sometimes
especially
in
country
districts
such
winter
vegetables
are
buried
in
the

will
not

exactly
when

produce
more
food
than
she
needs
to
meet
the
requirements
of

instead
she
will
reduce
the
quantities
to
suit
her
wants
likewise
if

enough

will
increase
the
quantities
accordingly

in
the
preparation
of
a
meal
it
is
impossible
to
follow
the
order
of
service
given
in
a
menu
because
of
the
different
lengths
of
time
required
to
prepare
the
different
dishes
the
order
in
which
the
menu
here
given
should
be
prepared
will
therefore
serve
to
show
the
way
in
which
other
meals
may
be
planned
or
other
menus
carried
out
each
recipe
for
this
menu
is
planned
to
serve
six
persons
but
it
can
be
easily
changed
in
case
a
different
number
are
to
be
served
for
instance
if
there
are
only
four
in
the
family
of
each
ingredient
should
be
used
and
if
only
three
just
of
each
if
eight
are
to
be
served
will
have
to
be
added
to
each
of
the
amounts
as
has
been
pointed
out
just
a
little
thought
will
show
how
other
numbers
may
be
provided
for
in
preparing
the
foods
called
for
in
this
menu
the
dessert
which
is
the
last
thing
given
should
be
prepared
first
because
time
must
be
allowed
for
it
to
cool
before
serving
in
fact
it
may
be
prepared
a
half
day
before
it
is
to
be
served
so
as
to
allow
sufficient
time
to
mash
the
potatoes
after
they
have
boiled
they
should
be
made
ready
to
put
on
the
stove
about
hour
before
the
meal
is
to
be
served
after
the
potatoes
have
been
put
on
to
boil
the
peas
provided
fresh
ones
are
to
be
used
should
be
put
on
to
cook
and
then
the
sauce
for
them
should
be
made
if
canned
peas
are
to
be
used
the
sauce
should
be
made
after
the
potatoes
have
been
put
on
the
stove
and
the
peas
should
be
heated
and
combined
with
the
sauce
just
before
broiling
the
chops
the
cabbage
salad
may
then
be
prepared
and
put
in
a
cool
place
until
it
is
to
be
served
the
chops
should
be
broiled
last
because
it
is
necessary
that
they
be
served
immediately
upon
being
taken
from
the
fire
terms
used
in
cookery
it
is
important
that
every
person
who
is
engaged
in
the
preparation
of
food
be
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
various
terms
that
are
used
in
cookery
many
of
these
are
not
understood
by
the
average
person
because
they
are
foreign
terms
or
words
that
are
seldom
employed
in
other
occupations
however
as
they
occur
frequently
in
recipes
cook
books
menus
familiarity
with
them
will
enable
one
to
follow
recipes
and
to
make
up
menus
in
a
more
intelligent
manner
in
view
of
these
facts
a
table
of
terms
that
are
made
use
of
in
cookery
is
here
given
together
with
definitions
of
the
words
and
wherever
it
has
been
deemed
necessary
with
as
accurate
pronunciations
as
can
be
obtained
the
terms
are
given
in
type
and
for
easy
reference
are
arranged
alphabetically
it
is
recommended
that
constant
use
be
made
of
this
table
for
much
of
the
success
achieved
in
cookery
depends
on
a
clear
understanding
of
the
words
and
expressions
that
are
peculiar
to
this
science

production
of
cereals
origin
of
which
is
the
term
applied
to
the
edible
seeds
of
certain
grains
originated
with
the
civilization
of
man
when
man
lived
in
a
savage
state
he
wandered
about
from
place
to
place
and
depended
for
his
food
on
hunting
and
fishing
but
as
he
ceased
his
roaming
and
began
to
settle
in
regions
that
he
found
attractive
it
was
not
long
before
he
became
aware
of
the
possibilities
of
the
ground
about
him
and
realized
the
advantage
of
tilling
the
soil
as
a
means
of
procuring
food
indeed
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
for
the
production
of
food
may
be
considered
as
one
of
the
first
steps
in
his
civilization
among
the
foods
he
cultivated
were
grains
and
from
the
earliest
times
to
the
present
day
they
have
been
the
main
crop
and
have
formed
the
chief
food
of
people
wherever
it
is
possible
to
produce
them
the
grains
belong
to
the
family
of
grasses
and
through
cultivation
their
seeds
which
store
the
nourishment
for
the
growth
of
new
plants
have
been
made
to
store
a
sufficient
amount
of
nourishment
to
permit
man
to
collect
and
use
it
as
food
the
name
cereals
was
derived
from
the
goddess
ceres
whom
the
romans
believed
to
be
the
protector
of
their
crops
and
harvests
numerous
grains
are
produced
but
only
eight
of
these
cereals
are
used
extensively
as
food
namely
wheat
corn
oats
rice
barley
rye
buckwheat
and
millet
abundance
of
with
the
exception
of
the
desert
lands
and
the
arctic
regions
cereals
of
some
kind
are
grown
over
the
entire
world
some
varieties
thrive
in
the
hot
countries
others
flourish
in
the
temperate
regions
and
still
others
mature
and
ripen
in
the
short
warm
season
of
the
colder
northern
climates
in
fact
there
is
practically
no
kind
of
soil
that
will
not
produce
a
crop
of
some
variety
of
grain
since
grains
are
so
easily
grown
and
are
so
plentiful
cereals
and
foods
made
from
them
furnish
a
large
part
of
the
world
food
supply
indeed
about
of
all
the
food
eaten
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
when
it
is
considered
as
a
whole
is
made
up
of
cereals
economic
value
of
the
abundance
of
the
world
grain
supply
makes
the
cost
so
moderate
that
many
of
the
poorer
classes
of
people
in
various
countries
especially
those
in
the
far
east
live
almost
entirely
on
cereals
still
there
is
another
factor
that
controls
the
low
cost
of
cereals
and
grains
and
keeps
them
within
the
means
of
all
classes
of
people
and
that
is
their
excellent
keeping
quality
they
require
very
little
care
and
will
keep
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
because
of
their
unperishable
nature
they
may
be
stored
in
large
quantities
and
distributed
to
consumers
as
they
are
needed
and
at
a
price
that
is
fairly
uniform
since
the
cost
of
cereals
is
moderate
they
should
form
a
large
proportion
of
the
diet
of
the
entire
family
especially
if
the
income
will
allow
only
a
limited
sum
to
be
spent
for
food
some
cereals
of
course
are
much
cheaper
than
others
and
in
purchasing
this
kind
of
food
the
housewife
should
be
governed
accordingly
those
which
require
an
elaborate
manufacturing
process
in
their
preparation
for
the
market
are
the
most
expensive
but
they
have
an
advantage
in
that
they
require
practically
no
preparation
before
serving
for
the
varieties
that
must
be
cooked
the
cost
of
preparing
the
dish
especially
if
the
price
of
fuel
is
high
must
be
taken
into
consideration
for
unless
some
thought
is
given
to
the
economical
use
of
the
fuel
as
well
as
to
the
method
of
cooking
employed
the
cost
of
the
prepared
dish
may
be
greatly
increased
however
in
the
preparation
of
cereals
very
little
skill
or
energy
is
required
and
a
general
knowledge
of
the
best
methods
for
one
of
them
can
as
a
rule
be
applied
to
all
cereal
besides
the
cereals
already
mentioned
a
number
of
products
of
cereals
are
extensively
used
in
cookery
chief
among
them
being
flour
corn
starch
and
other
starches
although
every
housewife
should
possess
knowledge
of
the
uses
of
each
of
these
instruction
in
them
is
not
given
until
later
this
section
includes
particularly
the
study
of
grains
whole
cracked
flaked
and
those
made
into
grits
or
meal
and
the
use
and
the
serving
of
them
as
well
as
cereals
which
are
commonly
referred
to
as
the
only
additional
foods
to
which
attention
is
given
at
this
time
are
macaroni
spaghetti
and
foods
of
a
similar
nature
for
as
these
are
made
from
wheat
they
are
truly
cereal
products
in
their
preparation
for
the
table
the
rules
that
govern
the
other
cereal
foods
apply
also
in
a
large
measure
to
them
composition
of
cereals
the
composition
of
all
cereals
is
similar
yet
each
one
has
its
distinguishing
feature
while
all
the
five
food
substances
water
mineral
matter
protein
fat
and
carbohydrate
are
to
be
found
in
cereals
they
occur
in
different
quantities
in
the
various
kinds
some
contain
large
quantities
of
protein
and
others
practically
none
and
while
certain
ones
have
considerable
fat
others
possess
comparatively
small
quantities
a
characteristic
of
all
cereals
however
is
that
they
contain
a
large
amount
of
carbohydrate
and
a
small
amount
of
water
it
is
well
to
remember
though
that
while
the
food
substances
of
cereals
are
found
in
sufficient
quantities
to
sustain
life
they
will
not
permit
a
person
to
live
for
long
periods
of
time
exclusively
on
this
form
of
food
likewise
it
will
be
well
to
observe
that
the
foods
made
from
a
certain
grain
will
be
quite
similar
in
composition
to
the
grain
itself
that
is
any
change
in
the
composition
of
the
foods
must
be
brought
about
by
the
addition
of
other
substances
all
grains
are
similar
in
general
structure
too
the
largest
proportion
of
carbohydrate
lies
in
the
center
this
substance
growing
less
toward
the
outside
of
the
grain
the
protein
lies
near
the
outside
and
grows
less
toward
the
center
fat
is
found
in
small
amounts
scattered
through
the
entire
grain
but
most
of
it
is
found
in
the
which
is
a
tiny
portion
of
the
grain
from
which
the
new
plant
sprouts
the
mineral
matter
of
cereals
is
found
chiefly
just
inside
the
bran
or
outer
covering
so
that
when
this
covering
is
removed
as
in
the
process
of
preparation
for
food
a
certain
amount
of
mineral
matter
is
generally
lost
protein
in
the
cereals
are
essentially
a
carbohydrate
food
but
some
also
yield
a
large
proportion
of
protein
in
this
respect
they
differ
from
the
animal
foods
that
produce
the
principal
supply
of
protein
for
the
diet
for
these
with
the
exception
of
milk
do
not
yield
carbohydrates
the
grain
that
contains
the
most
protein
is
wheat
and
in
the
form
in
which
protein
occurs
in
this
cereal
it
is
called
a
substance
that
is
responsible
for
the
hardness
of
wheat
the
gluten
when
the
wheat
is
mixed
with
water
or
some
other
liquid
becomes
gummy
and
elastic
a
fact
that
accounts
for
the
rubbery
consistency
of
bread
dough
cereals
that
contain
no
gluten
do
not
make
bread
successfully
next
to
wheat
rye
contains
protein
in
the
greatest
amount
and
rice
contains
the
least
although
protein
is
the
most
expensive
of
the
food
substances
the
kind
of
protein
found
in
cereals
is
one
of
the
cheaper
varieties
fat
in
the
fat
of
cereals
helps
to
contribute
to
their
qualities
and
besides
it
is
one
of
the
cheaper
sources
of
this
food
substance
of
the
eight
grains
or
cereals
used
as
food
oats
and
corn
contain
the
most
fat
or
material
the
oil
of
corn
because
of
its
lack
of
flavor
is
frequently
used
in
the
manufacture
of
salad
oil
cooking
oil
and
pastry
fat
the
fat
that
occurs
in
cereals
becomes
rancid
if
they
are
not
carefully
stored
in
the
making
of
white
flour
the
germ
of
the
wheat
is
removed
and
since
most
of
the
fat
is
taken
out
with
the
germ
white
flour
keeps
much
better
than
graham
flour
from
which
the
germ
is
not
abstracted
in
the
milling
process
carbohydrate
in
the
food
substance
found
in
the
greatest
proportion
in
cereals
is
carbohydrate
in
the
form
of
starch
cereals
contain
many
times
more
starch
than
any
of
the
other
food
substances
rice
which
is
fully
starch
containing
the
most
and
oats
which
are
less
than
starch
the
least
starch
is
distributed
throughout
the
grain
in
tiny
granules
visible
only
under
the
microscope
each
being
surrounded
by
a
covering
of
material
that
is
almost
indigestible
in
the
various
grains
these
tiny
granules
differ
from
one
another
in
appearance
but
not
to
any
great
extent
in
general
structure
nutritive
value
or
digestibility
provided
they
are
cooked
thoroughly
the
large
amount
of
carbohydrate
or
starch
in
cereals
explains
why
they
are
not
hard
to
digest
for
as
is
well
known
starch
is
more
easily
digested
than
either
protein
or
fat
this
and
the
fact
that
some
grains
contain
also
a
large
amount
of
fat
account
for
the
high
quality
of
cereals
while
it
is
safe
to
say
that
cereals
are
chiefly
valuable
for
their
starch
the
material
in
some
grains
although
in
small
proportion
is
in
sufficient
quantity
to
place
them
with
the
protein
foods
mineral
matter
in
cereals
contain
seven
or
eight
of
the
minerals
required
in
the
diet
such
a
variety
of
minerals
is
sure
to
be
valuable
to
the
human
body
as
it
is
about
of
the
whole
number
required
by
the
body
for
its
maintenance
since
as
has
already
been
explained
much
of
the
mineral
matter
lies
directly
under
the
coarse
outside
covering
some
of
it
is
lost
when
this
covering
is
removed
for
this
reason
the
grains
that
remain
whole
and
the
cereal
products
that
contain
the
entire
grain
are
much
more
valuable
from
the
standpoint
of
minerals
than
those
in
which
the
bran
covering
is
not
retained
if
a
sufficient
percentage
of
minerals
is
secured
in
the
diet
from
vegetables
fruits
and
milk
it
is
perhaps
unnecessary
to
include
whole
cereals
but
if
the
diet
is
at
all
limited
it
is
advisable
to
select
those
cereals
which
retain
the
original
composition
of
the
grain
water
in
cereals
contain
very
little
water
in
their
composition
this
absence
of
water
is
a
distinct
advantage
for
it
makes
their
nutritive
value
proportionately
high
and
improves
their
keeping
quality
just
as
the
strength
of
a
beverage
is
lowered
by
the
addition
of
water
so
the
nutritive
value
of
foods
decreases
when
they
contain
a
large
amount
of
water
on
the
other
hand
the
keeping
quality
of
cereals
could
scarcely
be
improved
since
the
germs
that
cause
foods
to
spoil
grow
only
in
the
presence
of
water
this
low
proportion
of
water
also
permits
them
to
be
stored
compactly
whereas
if
water
occurred
in
large
amounts
it
would
add
materially
to
their
bulk
cellulose
in
in
addition
to
the
five
food
substances
that
are
found
in
all
cereals
there
is
always
present
another
material
known
as
cellulose
which
as
is
pointed
out
elsewhere
is
an
indigestible
material
that
occurs
on
the
outside
of
all
grains
as
the
bran
covering
and
covers
the
starch
granules
throughout
the
inside
of
the
grain
in
fact
it
forms
a
sort
of
skeleton
upon
which
the
grains
are
built
as
long
as
the
cellulose
remains
unbroken
it
prevents
the
grain
from
being
digested
to
any
extent
however
it
forms
a
valuable
protective
covering
for
the
grain
and
it
has
a
certain
value
as
bulk
in
the
diet
a
fact
that
is
ignored
by
some
persons
and
overrated
by
others
it
is
well
to
include
at
least
some
cellulose
in
cereal
foods
when
they
are
taken
in
the
diet
because
its
presence
tends
to
make
food
less
concentrated
table
showing
composition
of
not
all
grains
or
cereals
contain
the
same
amount
of
food
substances
and
cellulose
that
is
while
one
may
be
high
in
protein
it
may
be
lacking
in
some
other
food
substance
the
relation
that
the
various
grains
bear
to
one
another
with
regard
to
the
food
substances
and
cellulose
is
clearly
set
forth
in
table
i
in
this
table
under
the
various
food
substances
and
cellulose
the
grains
with
the
exception
of
millet
are
mentioned
in
the
order
of
their
value
ranging
from
the
highest
down
to
the
lowest
in
each
of
the
food
substances
and
cellulose
thus
as
will
be
seen
wheat
is
highest
in
protein
and
rice
is
lowest
oats
are
highest
in
fat
and
rye
is
lowest
and
so
on
also
as
will
be
observed
while
wheat
is
highest
in
protein
it
is
as
compared
with
the
other
cereals
sixth
in
fat
fourth
in
carbohydrate
fourth
in
cellulose
and
fifth
in
mineral
matter
in
this
way
may
be
compared
all
the
other
cereals
to
see
in
just
what

they
are

cereals
as

uses
of

cereals
and
cereal
products
play
a
very
important
part
in
the
food
problem
for
the
prosperity
of
a
country
depends
on
its
grain
crops
and
the
people
of
all
classes
are
dependent
on
them
for
food
this
is
evident
when
it
is
known
that
they
form
a
greater
proportion
of
the
food
consumed
than
any
other
single
food
material
in
their
widespread
consumption
they
have
many
and
varied
uses
in
truth
a
meal
is
seldom
served
without
some
cereal
food
for
if
no
other
is
used
bread
of
some
description
is
almost
always
included
besides
bread
a
cooked
or
a
dry
cereal
is
usually
served
for
breakfast
and
for
some
persons
this
constitutes
the
main
breakfast
dish
providing
a
nourishing
and
easily
digested
food
when
served
with
milk
or
cream
this
food
is
especially
desirable
for
children
and
for
this
reason
is
always
among
the
first
solid
foods
fed
to
them
while
to
most
persons
the
word
cereal
suggests
the
idea
of
a
breakfast
food
because
cereals
are
used
most
often
for
that
purpose
they
find
their
place
in
other
meals
than
breakfast
although
they
are
used
less
often
on
the
dinner
table
than
elsewhere
they
frequently
have
an
important
place
there
for
a
number
of
them
are
commonly
used
as
dinner
dishes
and
others
might
be
used
more
frequently
and
to
advantage
too
in
this
connection
they
are
used
in
soups
and
in
certain
forms
usually
the
whole
or
slightly
crushed
grain
they
take
the
place
of
a
vegetable
some
of
them
particularly
rice
are
often
used
with
meat
or
cheese
in
making
an
entree
or
in
combination
with
eggs
milk
fruit
or
various
flavorings
as
a
dessert
to
be
served
with
a
heavy
or
a
light
meal
cold
cooked
cereal
is
often
sliced
and
sautéd
and
then
served
with
meat
or
some
other
heavy
protein
dish
cereals
are
also
used
for
lunch
or
supper
perhaps
more
often
than
for
dinner
and
because
of
their
easy
digestion
they
are
to
be
recommended
for
the
evening
meal
for
all
members
of
the
family
but
especially
for
children
when
used
in
this
way
they
may
be
served
with
cream
as
for
breakfast
or
prepared
in
any
other
suitable
way
whenever
cereals
are
served
whether
alone
or
in
combination
with
other
foods
the
result
is
an
economical
dish
and
usually
an
easily
digested
one
unless
of
course
the
food
with
which
they
are
combined
is
expensive
or
indigestible
but
to
whatever
use
cereals
are
put
unless
they
are
thoroughly
cooked
they
are
not
easily
digested
and
they
lose
much
of
their
value
in
fact
the
cereals
which
have
been
thoroughly
cooked
are
preferable
to
those
which
are
poorly
cooked
in
the
home
selection
and
care
of
cereals
preparation
of
grains
for
the
so
that
the
housewife
may
go
about
the
selection
of
cereals
in
an
intelligent
manner
it
may
be
well
for
her
to
know
how
they
are
prepared
for
market
after
the
grains
are
harvested
the
first
step
in
their
preparation
consists
in
thrashing
which
removes
the
husks
from
the
outside
in
some
countries
thrashing
is
done
entirely
by
hand
but
usually
it
is
accomplished
by
machinery
of
a
simple
or
a
more
elaborate
kind
occasionally
no
further
treatment
is
applied
the
whole
grains
being
used
as
food
but
generally
they
receive
further
preparation
sometimes
they
are
crushed
coarsely
with
or
without
the
bran
covering
and
in
this
form
they
are
known
as
at
other
times
they
are
ground
finer
and
called
and
still
finer
and
called
being
used
mostly
in
these
two
forms
for
the
making
of
various
kinds
of
breads
then
again
grains
are
rolled
and
crushed
as
for
example
and
various
elaborate
means
have
been
devised
by
which
cereals
are
prepared
in
unusual
ways
for
the
purpose
of
varying
the
diet
sometimes
they
are
used
alone
but
often
certain
other
materials
are
used
in
their
preparation
for
the
market
for
example
the
popular
flake
cereals
such
as
corn
flakes
are
cooked
with
salt
and
sometimes
with
sugar
and
then
rolled
thin
some
of
the
cereals
are
thoroughly
cooked
while
others
are
malted
and
toasted
but
the
treatment
to
which
they
are
subjected
is
generally
given
to
them
to
improve
their
flavor
and
to
aid
in
the
work
of
digestion
factors
that
govern
cereal
besides
knowing
about
the
ways
in
which
cereals
are
prepared
for
market
the
housewife
should
be
familiar
with
the
factors
that
govern
their
selection
for
use
as
food
in
the
first
place
cereals
should
be
chosen
to
suit
the
needs
and
tastes
of
the
members
of
the
family
and
then
attention
should
be
given
to
the
forms
in
which
they
can
be
purchased
some
cereals
are
sold
in
sealed
packages
while
others
can
be
bought
in
bulk
each
however
has
its
advantages
those
sold
loose
are
often
lower
in
price
than
those
sold
in
package
form
but
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
with
the
chances
for
incorrect
weight
the
bulk
foods
are
really
much
cheaper
cleanliness
is
of
course
of
greater
importance
with
cereals
that
do
not
require
cooking
than
with
those
which
are
subjected
to
high
temperatures
in
order
to
prepare
them
for
the
table
therefore
from
the
standpoint
of
cleanliness
there
is
no
advantage
in
purchasing
rice
and
similar
raw
cereals
in
packages
the
next
thing
to
consider
in
the
purchase
of
cereals
is
their
cost
they
vary
considerably
in
price
but
it
has
been
determined
that
in
food
value
there
is
little
difference
pound
for
pound
between
the
cheap
and
the
expensive
cereals
the
variation
in
price
being
due
to
their
abundance
or
scarcity
and
the
method
used
in
preparing
them
for
market
the
entirely
uncooked
ones
are
the
cheapest
the
partly
cooked
ones
are
medium
in
price
and
the
thoroughly
cooked
ones
are
the
most
expensive
this
difference
however
is
practically
made
up
by
the
expense
of
the
fuel
required
to
prepare
them
for
the
table
the
cheapest
cereal
requiring
the
most
fuel
and
the
most
expensive
the
least
besides
varying
in
price
the
different
kinds
of
cereals
offer
the
housewife
an
opportunity
to
select
the
one
that
is
most
convenient
for
her
those
which
are
ready
to
serve
are
the
best
for
the
meal
to
which
the
least
possible
amount
of
time
can
be
given
for
preparation
the
other
kinds
require
cooking
of
course
but
this
need
not
be
a
hindrance
for
they
can
be
prepared
on
one
day
and
reheated
for
breakfast
the
following
day
or
they
can
be
cooked
overnight
by
the
method
in
the
case
of
such
cereals
long
cooking
is
usually
necessary
for
good
flavor
and
easy
digestion
consequently
the
cooking
method
that
will
accomplish
the
desired
result
with
the
least
expenditure
of
fuel
is
the
most
economical
one
and
the
one
to
select
table
of
grain

a
further
aid
in
coming
to
an
understanding
of

will
be

the
housewife
care
of
as
carriers
of
disease
cereals
are
a
less
dangerous
food
than
any
other
this
characteristic
of
cereals
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
cooking
all
of
them
require
in
some
part
of
their
preparation
destroys
any
disease
germs
that
might
be
present
they
are
not
likely
to
be
adulterated
with
harmful
material
either
and
in
addition
the
sealed
packages
in
which
many
of
the
cereals
are
put
up
keep
them
clean
and
free
from
contamination
however
care
must
be
given
to
both
the
uncooked
and
the
varieties
of
this
food
the
packages
containing
cereals
should
not
be
allowed
to
remain
open
for
any
length
of
time
if
it
is
desired
to
keep
them
fresh
and
crisp
for
they
absorb
moisture
from
the
air
very
quickly
if
they
do
become
moist
however
drying
in
the
oven
will
in
most
cases
restore
their
freshness
if
it
is
necessary
to
open
a
single
package
of
prepared
cereal
and
all
of
the
contents
can
not
be
utilized
at
once
as
for
instance
when
only
one
or
two
persons
are
to
be
served
with
that
particular
cereal
the
best
plan
is
to
empty
the
remainder
into
cans
or
jars
that
are
provided
with
covers
uncooked
cereals
which
are
used
less
quickly
than
the
prepared
kinds
are
often
attacked
by
mice
and
other
vermin
but
such
an
occurrence
can
be
prevented
if
the
cereal
is
poured
into
jars
or
cans
that
can
be
kept
tightly
closed
considerable
care
must
be
given
to
flour
and
cereal
products
purchased
in
large
quantities
for
if
they
are
allowed
to
collect
enough
moisture
they
will
become
moldy
and
lose
their

and
thus
be

undergo
a
marked
change
which
can
readily
be
determined
by
performing
a
simple
experiment
place
an
equal
amount

both

products
in
two
different
glasses
mix

proves
then
that
grains
that
come
in
contact
with
water
at
a
high
temperature
as
in

absorb
the
water

burst

for

before
the

it
is
advisable
for
the

to
get
out
all

as
well
as
all

first
steps
in
the
process
of
while
cereals
may
be
cooked
in
a
variety
of
ways
the
first
steps
in
all
the
processes
are
practically
the
same
in
the
first
place
the
required
amount
of
water
should
be
brought
to
the
boiling
point
for
if
the
water
is
boiling
the
cereal
will
thicken
more
rapidly
and
there
will
be
less
danger
of
lumps
forming
then
salt
should
be
added
to
the
water
in
the
proportion
of
teaspoonful
to
each
cupful
of
cereal
next
the
cereal
should
be
stirred
into
the
boiling
salted
water
slowly
enough
to
prevent
it
from
forming
lumps
and
then
being
constantly
stirred
it
should
be
allowed
to
cook
until
it
thickens
the
process

called
a
cereal
or

after
the
cereal
is
it
may
be
boiled
steamed
or
cooked
in
the
fireless
cooker
but
the
method
of
cookery
selected
should
be
chosen
with
a
view
to
economy
convenience
and
thoroughness
the
terms
and
should
be
thoroughly
fixed
in
the
mind
so
that
directions
and
recipes
in
which
they
are
used
will
be
readily
understood
cooking
cereals
by
very
often
the
cereal
after
it
is
set
is
allowed
to
cook
slowly
until
it
is
ready
to
serve
that
is
the
method
of
is
practiced
this
method
however
is
not
to
be
recommended
because
it
is
not
economical
cereals
cooked
in
this
way
require
constant
watching
and
stirring
and
even
then
it
is
difficult
to
keep
them
from
sticking
to
the
cooking
utensil
and
scorching
or
becoming
pasty
on
account
of
the
constant
motion
sometimes
to
overcome
this
condition
a
large
quantity
of
water
is
added
as
in
the
boiling
of
rice
still
as
some
of
this
water
must
be
poured
off
after
the
cooking
is
completed
a
certain
amount
of
starch
and
soluble
material
is
lost
cooking
cereals
in
the
double
probably
the
most
satisfactory
way
in
which
to
cook
cereals
so
far
as
thoroughness
is
concerned
is
in
a
double
boiler
one
style
of
which
is
shown
at
fig
this
method
of
cookery
is
known
as
or
and
by
it
the
food
itself
after
it
is
set
never
comes
within
or
degrees
of
the
boiling
point
in
this
method
the
cereal
is
first
set
in
the
small
or
upper
pan
of
the
double
boiler
this
pan
which
is
covered
is
placed
into
the
large
or
lower
pan
which
should
contain
boiling
water
and
the
cereal
is
allowed
to
cook
until
it
is
ready
to
serve
the
water
in
the
large
pan
should
be
replenished
from
time
to
time
for
if
it
is
completely
evaporated
by
boiling
the
pan
will
be
spoiled
and
the
cereal
in
the
upper
pan
will
burn
this
method
of
cooking
has
several
advantages
that
should
not
be
disregarded
cereals
to
which
it
is
applied
may
be
partly
cooked
on
one
day
and
the
cooking
completed
the
next
morning
before
breakfast
or
they
may
be
completely
cooked
on
one
day
and
merely
heated
before
they
are
served
then
when
cooked
at
a
temperature
slightly
below
the
boiling
point
the
grains
remain
whole
but
become
thoroughly
softened
because
they
gradually
absorb
the
water
that
surrounds
them
in
addition
the
long
cooking
that
is
necessary
to
prepare
them
at
a
low
temperature
develops
a
delicious
flavor
which
can
not
be
obtained
by
rapid
cooking
at
the
boiling
point
cooking
cereals
in
the
fireless
in
a
kitchen
that
is
equipped
with
a
fireless
cooker
it
is
advisable
to
use
this
utensil
for
cereals
for
cooking
them
by
this
method
secures
the
greatest
economy
of
fuel
and
effort
as
in
the
preceding
methods
the
cereal
is
first
set
in
the
pan
that
fits
into
the
cooker
compartment
while
the
cereal
is
at
the
boiling
point
this
pan
is
covered
tightly
and
placed
in
the
fireless
cooker
where
it
is
allowed
to
remain
until
the
cereal
is
ready
to
be
served
the
heat
that
the
cereal
holds
when
it
is
placed
in
the
cooker
is
retained
and
this
is
what
cooks
it
therefore
while
this
method
of
cooking
requires
considerable
time
it
needs
neither
additional
heat
nor
labor
after
the
cereal
is
placed
in
the
cooker
in
reality
it
is
an
advantageous
way
in
which
to
cook
cereals
since
if
they
can
be
set
and
placed
in
the
cooker
in
the
evening
they
will
be
ready
to
serve
at
breakfast
time
on
the
following
day
cooking
cereals
by
dry
an
old
method
of
cooking
cereals
or
starchy
foods
is
called
or
and
it
involves
cooking
them
by
dry
heat
a
thin
layer
of
grain
is
spread
in
a
shallow
pan
and
this
is
placed
in
a
slow
oven
after
the
grains
have
browned
slightly
they
are
stirred
and
then
they
are
permitted
to
brown
until
an
even
color
is
obtained
by
this
method
the
flavor
of
the
cereals
is
developed
and
their
digestibility
increased
since
grains
keep
much
better
after
they
have
been
subjected
to
the
process
of
toasting
this
means
is
used
extensively
for
preserving
grains
and
cereal
foods
points
to
observe
in
cooking
in
cooking
cereals
by
any
method
except
browning
or
toasting
it
is
always
necessary
to
use
liquid
of
some
kind
the
quantity
to
use
however
varies
with
the
kind
of
cereal
that
is
to
be
cooked
whole
cereals
and
those
coarsely
ground
requiring
more
liquid
than
those
which
are
crushed
or
finely
ground
if
the
liquid
is
to
be
absorbed
completely
when
the
grain
is
cooked
it
should
be
in
the
correct
proportion
to
the
grain
to
be
right
cooked
cereals
should
be
of
the
consistency
of
mush
but
not
thin
enough
to
pour
much
attention
should
be
given
to
this
matter
for
mistakes
are
difficult
to
remedy
cereals
that
are
too
thick
after
they
are
cooked
can
not
be
readily
thinned
without
becoming
lumpy
and
those
which
are
too
thin
can
not
be
brought
to
the
proper
consistency
unless
the
excess
of
liquid
is
evaporated
by
boiling
are
of
course
much
thinner
than
the
usual
form
of
cereal
they
are
made
by
cooking
cereals
rapidly
in
a
large
quantity
of
water
and
this
causes
the
starch
grains
to
disintegrate
or
break
into
pieces
and
mix
with
the
water
the
whole
mixture
is
then
poured
through
a
sieve
which
removes
the
coarse
particles
and
produces
a
smooth
mass
that
is
thin
enough
to
pour
the
length
of
time
to
cook
cereals
also
varies
with
their
kind
and
form
the
coarse
ones
requiring
more
time
than
the
fine
ones
because
of
this
fact
it
is
difficult
to
say
just
how
much
time
is
required
to
cook
the
numerous
varieties
thoroughly
however
little
difficulty
will
be
experienced
if
it
is
remembered
that
cereals
should
always
be
allowed
to
cook
until
they
can
be
readily
crushed
between
the
fingers
but
not
until
they
are
mushy

indian
corn
or

origin
classification
and
use
the
word
has
been
applied
to
various
grains
and
is
now
used
in
a
variety
of
ways
in
different
countries
in
ancient
times
barley
was
called
corn
and
at
the
present
time
in
some
countries
the
entire
year
food
crop
is
referred
to
by
this
name
the

and
the

in
the
united
states
corn
is
the
name
applied
to
the
seed
of
the
maize
plant
which
is
a
highly
developed
grass
plant
that
forms
the
largest
single
crop
of
the
country
the
seeds
of
this
plant
grow
on
a
woody
cob
and
are
eaten
as
a
vegetable
when
they
are
soft
and
milky
but
as
a
grain
or
cereal
when
they
are
mature
corn
is
native
to
america
and
was
not
known
in
europe
until
columbus
took
it
back
with
him
however
it
did
not
meet
with
much
favor
there
for
it
was
not
grown
to
any
great
extent
until
within
the
last
years
those
who
took
it
to
europe
gave
it
the
name
because
they
had
found
the
indians
of
america
raising
it
of
the
corn
grown
in
the
united
states
there
are
three
general
kinds
field
corn
sweet
corn
and
pop
corn
as
a
rule
is
grown
in
large
quantities
and
allowed
to
mature
then
it
is
fed
to
animals
or
ground
and
cooked
for
the
use
of
man
this
corn
consists
of
three
varieties
which
are
distinguished
by
the
color
of
the
grain
one
being
white
one
yellow
and
one
red
all
of
them
are
made
into
a
variety
of
preparations
but
the
white
and
the
yellow
are
used
as
food
for
both
man
and
animals
whereas
red
field
corn
is
used
exclusively
for
animal
food
white
corn
has
a
mild
flavor
but
yellow
corn
is
sometimes
preferred
to
it
because
foods
made
from
the
yellow
variety
have
a
more
decided
flavor
the
two
principal
varieties
of
field
corn
when
prepared
as
cereal
food
for
man
are
and
is
not
grown
in
such
large
quantities
as
field
corn
it
is
generally
used
for
food
before
it
is
mature
and
is
considered
as
a
vegetable
when
sufficiently
dry
swells
and
bursts
upon
being
heated
it
is
used
more
as
a
confection
than
as
a
staple
article
of
food
therefore
at
this
time
consideration
need
be
given
to
only
the
principal
varieties
of
products
which
as
has
just
been
stated
are
hominy
and
corn
meal
recipes
for
hominy
and
corn
meal
hominy
is
whole
corn
from
which
the
outside
covering
has
been
removed
and
for
this
reason
it
is
high
in
food
value
corn
in
this
form
may
be
procured
as
a
commercial
product
but
it
may
be
prepared
in
the
home
at
less
expense
as
a
commercial
product
it
is
sold
dry
by
the
pound
or
cooked
as
a
canned
food
dry
hominy
requires
long
cooking
to
make
it
palatable
and
this
of
course
increases
its
cost
but
even
with
this
additional
cost
it
is
cheaper
than
canned
hominy
sometimes
corn
from
which
the
covering
has
been
removed
is
ground
or
crushed
to
form
what
is
called
or
and
when
it
is
ground
still
more
finely
corn
meal
is
produced
corn
meal
is
made
from
both
white
and
yellow
corn
and
is
ground
more
finely
in
some
localities
than
in
others
it
is
sold
loose
by
the
pound
but
it
can
also
be
bought
in
bags
or
packages
of
various
sizes
from
pound
up
corn
meal
should
be
included
in
the
diet
of
every
economical
family
for
it
yields
a
large
quantity
of
food
at
a
moderately
low
cost
if
it
is
prepared
well
it
is
very
palatable
and
when
eaten
with
milk
or
cream
it
is
a
food
that
is
particularly
desirable
for
children
especially
for
the
evening
meal
because
of
its
food
value
and
the
fact
that
it
is
easily
digested
so
that
the
importance
of
these
corn
products
may
be
understood
and
the
products
then
used
to
the
best
advantage
in
the
diet
recipes
are
here
given
for
preparing
hominy
in
the
home
for
dishes
in
which
hominy
forms
the
principal
part
and
for
dishes
in
which
corn
meal
is
used
to
get
the
best
results
from
these
recipes
and
thereby
become
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
cooking
processes
involved
it
is
recommended
that
each
one
be
worked
out
in
detail
this
thought
applies
as
well
to
all
recipes
given
throughout
the
various
sections
of
course
to
prepare
each
recipe
is
not
compulsory
nevertheless
to
learn
to
cook
right
means
actually
to
do
the
work
called
for
by
the
recipes
not
merely
once
but
from
time
to
time
as
the
food
can
be
utilized
to
give
variety
to
the
daily
menus
in
the
home
although
as
has
been
mentioned
prepared
hominy
may
be
purchased
some
housewives
prefer
to
prepare
it
themselves
hominy
serves
as
a
foundation
from
which
many
satisfactory
dishes
can
be
made
as
it
is
high
in
food
value
and
reasonable
in
cost
this
cereal
can
be
used
in
so
many
ways
that
it
is
advisable
to
prepare
enough
at
one
time
to
meet
the
demands
of
several
meals
the
following
recipe
for
making
hominy
should
provide
quarts
of
this
cereal
however
as
is
true
of
other
recipes
a
point
that
should
be
remembered
throughout
the
various
lessons
the
quantities
given
may
be
increased
or
decreased
to
meet
with
the
requirements
of

three
times
so
as
to

then
allow
the

to
cook
in
more
water

which
the
hominy
is
cooked
should
remain

perhaps
the
simplest
method
of
preparing
cooked
hominy
is
to
butter
it
in
this
form
it
may
be
served
with
cream
as
a

is
comparatively
inexpensive
and
high

value
the
housewife
can
make
frequent
use
of
it
to
advantage
in
the
form
of
mush
corn
meal
is
easily
digested
besides
such
mush
is
a
very
good
breakfast
cereal
when
served
hot
with
milk
or
cream
although
the
recipe
here
given
makes
a
sufficient
amount
for
six
persons
a
good
plan
is
to
increase
the
quantities
mentioned
so
that
there
will
be
enough
mush
left
to
mold
and
use
in
other
ways
mush
sufficient

add
the

the
salted
water
to
the
boiling
point
when
it
is
boiling
rapidly
sift
the
corn
meal
slowly
through
the
fingers
into
it
and
at
the
same
time
stir
it
rapidly
so
as
to
prevent
the
formation
of
lumps
any
mush
that
contains
lumps
has
not
been
properly
made
and
should
not
be
served
in
this
condition
as
it
is
unpalatable
keep
stirring
constantly
until
the
corn
meal
thickens
then
place
it
in
a
double
boiler
and
allow
it
to
cook
from
to
hours
when
it
should
be
ready
to
serve
this
method
of
cooking
mush
is
the
most
convenient
because
not
much
stirring
is
required
after
the
corn
meal
is
thickened
a
heavy
aluminum
kettle
or
an
iron
pot
is
a
good
utensil
in
which
to
cook
mush
as
it
does
not
burn
easily
in
either
although
almost
constant
stirring
is
required
when
the
mush
becomes
very
thick
the
heated
air
in
forcing
its
way
through
the
mush
in
the
process
of
boiling
makes
the
mush
pop
and
very
often
splash
on
the
hands
and
burn
them
to
avoid
such
an
accident
therefore
it
is
advisable
to
wrap
the
hand
used
for
stirring
in
a
towel
or
a
cloth
sautéd
mush
cooked
in
the
manner
just
explained
may
be
poured
into
pans
such
as
bread
pans
where
it
will
harden
and
form
a
mold
that
can
be
sliced
as
thick
or
as
thin
as
desired
and
then
sautéd
mush
prepared
in
this
way
pleases
the
taste
of
many
persons
and
while
some
persons
find
it
harder
to
digest
than
just
plain
mush
it
serves
to
give
variety
to
meals
for
sautéing
mush
a
heavy
iron
or
steel
frying
pan
or
griddle
should
be
used
because
utensils
made
of
thin
material
will
allow
the
mush
to
burn
before
it
browns
properly
put
enough
fat
such
as
lard
cooking
oil
or
drippings
into
the
cooking
utensil
so
that
when
heated
it
will
be
about
inch
deep
all
over
the
surface
when
the
utensil
is
very
hot
put
in
the
slices
of
mush
and
allow
them
to
brown
on
one
side
then
turn
the
slices
over
carefully
so
as
not
to
break
them
and
brown
them
on
the
other
side
as
will
be
observed
mush
does
not
brown
quickly
in
sautéing
this
characteristic
is
due
to
the
large
amount
of
moisture
it
contains
serve
the
mush
hot
and
to
add
to
its
flavor
serve
with
it
sirup
or
honey
croquettes
of
any
kind
add
variety
to
a
meal
and
because
they
are
attractive
they
appeal
to
the
appetite
to
make
croquettes
of
corn
meal
mold
mush
as
for
sautéing
then
cut
this
into
slices
inch
thick
and
cut
each
slice
into
strips
inch
wide
roll
these
in
slightly
beaten
egg
and
then
in
crumbs
and
sauté
them
in
hot
fat
until
they
are
crisp
and
brown
serve
these
croquettes
hot
with
either
butter
or
sirup
or
both
sautéd
mush
and
croquettes
can
of
course
be
made
from
mush
that
is
left
over
after
it
has
been
cooked
to
serve
as
a
cereal
however
if
there
is
only
a
small
quantity
left
it
may
be
utilized
in
still
another
way
namely
as
a
garnish
for
the
platter
on
which
meat
is
served
to
prepare
mush
in
this
way
spread
it
about
inch
thick
in
a
pan
and
allow
it
to
cool
then
turn
it
out
of
the
pan
in
a
sheet
on
a
board
that
has
been
floured
that
is
covered
thinly
with
flour
cut
this
sheet
of
corn
meal
into
small
circles
with
the
aid
of
a
round
cutter
or
into
diamond
shapes
with
a
knife
and
then
brown
both
sides
of
each
of
these
in
butter
wheat
origin
and
use
wheat
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
is
grown
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
forms
the
basis
for
a
large
amount
of
the
food
of
most
people
is
a
very
important
grain
it
was
probably
a
native
grass
of
asia
minor
and
egypt
for
in
these
countries
it
first
received
cultivation
from
the
land
of
its
origin
the
use
of
wheat
spread
over
all
the
world
but
it
was
not
introduced
into
america
until
after
the
discovery
of
this
country
by
columbus
now
however
the
united
states
raises
more
wheat
than
any
other
one
country
and
nearly
of
all
that
is
raised
in
the
world
wheat
is
universally
used
for
bread
because
it
contains
a
large
amount
of
the
kind
of
protein
that
lends
a
rubbery
consistency
to
dough
and
thus
makes
possible
the
incorporation
of
the
gas
or
air
required
to
make
bread
light
the
use
of
wheat
however
is
by
no
means
restricted
to
bread
for
as
is
well
known
many
cereal
foods
are
prepared
from
this
grain
in
its
simplest
food
form
wheat
is
prepared
by
merely
removing
the
coarse
bran
from
the
outside
of
the
wheat
grain
and
leaving
the
grain
whole
this
is
called

and
requires
soaking
or
long
slow
cooking
in
order
that
all
its
starch
granules
may
be
reached
and
softened
sufficiently
to
make
it
palatable
the
other
preparations
are
made
by
crushing
or
grinding
the
grains
from
which
some
of
the
bran
and
germ
has
been
removed
besides
flour
which
as
has
been
implied
is
not
considered
as
a
cereal
in
the
sense
used
in
this
section
these
preparations
include
such
foods
as
of
and
and
many
in
the
preparation
of
wheat
grits
much
of
the
bran
is
allowed
to
remain
but
neither
cream
of
wheat
nor
farina
contains
cellulose
in
any
appreciable
quantity
as
the
addition
of
bran
however
serves
to
give
these
foods
bulk
a
much
more
ideal
breakfast
cereal
will
result
if
before
cooking
equal
portions
of
the
cereal
and
the
bran
are
mixed
in
preparing
wheat
cereals
for
the
market
the
manufacturers
subject
the
grains
to
such
elaborate
methods
of
cooking
rolling
and
toasting
that
these
foods
require
but
very
little
additional
attention
before
serving
the
only
wheat
products
that
demand
further
attention
at
this

products
hulled
inasmuch
as
hulled
or
whole
wheat
requires
very
little
preparation
for
the
market
it
is
a
comparatively
cheap
food
it
is
used
almost
exclusively
as
a
breakfast
cereal
but
serves
as
a
good
substitute
for
hominy
or
rice
although
as
has
been
mentioned
it
requires
long
cooking
its
preparation
for
the
table
is
so
simple
that
the
cooking
need
not
necessarily
increase
its
cost
materially
one
of
the
advantages
of
this
food
is
that
it
never
becomes
so
soft
that
it
does
not
require

mastication

the

grits
is
made
commercially
by
crushing
the
wheat
grains
and
allowing
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
wheat

to
remain
grits
may
be
used
as
a
breakfast
cereal
when
they
should
be
served
hot

and
sugar
they
also
make
an
excellent
luncheon
dish
if
they
are
served
with
either
butter
or
gravy
the
fact
that
this
cereal
contains
bran
makes
it
an
excellent
one
to
use
in
cases
where
a
food
with
bulk
is
desired

this

the

the

manner
it

it
does
not

however
as
has
been
pointed
out
this
bulk
may
be
supplied
by
mixing
with
it
before
cooking
an
equal
amount
of

in
such
a
case
of
course
more
water
will
be
needed
and
the

will
have
to

prolonged

while
the
use
of
this

breakfast
cereal
is
not
generally
known
it
can
be
made
into

numerous
ways
have
been
devised
for
utilizing
wheat
cereals
that
are
left
over
so
that
no
waste
need
result
from
what
is
not
eaten
at
the
meal
for
which
a
cereal
is
cooked
for
instance
hulled
wheat
can
be
used
in
soup
in
the
same
way
as
barley
and
rice
and
plain
cream
of
wheat
and
farina
can
be
molded
sliced
and
sautéd
like
mush
and
served
with
sirup
the
molded
cereal
can
also
be
cut
into
cubes
and
served
with
any
fruit
juice
that
is
thickened
slightly
with
corn
starch
besides
utilizing
wheat
cereals
in
the
ways
mentioned
it
is
possible
to
make
them
into
custards
and
soufflés
as

rice
varieties
and
structure
rice
next
to
wheat
is
used
more
extensively
as
a
food
than
any
other
cereal
it
is
a
plant
much
like
wheat
in
appearance
but
it
grows
only
in
warm
climates
and
requires
very
moist
soil
in
fact
the
best
land
for
rice
is
that
which
may
be
flooded
with
about
inches
of
water
this
cereal
is
of
two
kinds
namely
carolina
rice
and
japanese
rice
which
is
raised
chiefly
in
the
southeastern
part
of
the
united
states
has
a
long
narrow
grain
whereas
which
originated
in
japan
and
is
raised
extensively
in
that
country
and
china
and
india
has
a
short
flat
oval
grain
efforts
made
to
raise
the
japanese
variety
in
the
united
states
show
a
peculiarity
of
this
cereal
for
when
it
is
planted
in
the
same
locality
as
carolina
rice
it
soon
loses
its
identity
and
takes
on
the
shape
of
the
other
although
vast
crops
of
rice
are
raised
in
the
united
states
a
large
quantity
of
it
must
be
imported
because
these
crops
are
not
sufficient
to
supply
the
demands
of
this
country
before
rice
grains
are
prepared
for
use
as
food
they
have
two
coverings
one
is
a
coarse
husk
that
is
thrashed
off
and
leaves
the
grain
in
the
form
of
unpolished
rice
and
the
other
a
thin
brown
coating
resembling
bran
this
thin
coating
which
is
very
difficult
to
remove
is
called
after
its
removal
at
one
time
so
much
was
said
about
the
harmful
effect
of
polished
rice
that
a
demand
for
unpolished
rice
was
begun
this
feeling
of
harm
however
was
unnecessary
for
while
polished
rice
lacks
mineral
matter
to
a
great
extent
it
is
hot
harmful
to
a
person
and
need
cause
no
uneasiness
unless
the
other
articles
of
the
diet
do
not
supply
a
sufficient
amount
of
this
food
substance
after
the
inner
coating
has
been
removed
some
of
the
rice
is
treated
with
paraffin
or
glucose
and
talc
to
give
it
a
glazed
appearance
this
is
called
and
is
sometimes
confounded
with
the
term
rice
polishings
however
no
confusion
regarding
these
terms
will
result
if
it
is
remembered
that
rice
polishings
are
the
thin
inner
coating
that
is
removed
and
polish
is
what
is
added
to
the
rice
in
composition
rice
differs
from
the
other
cereals
in
that
it
is
practically
all
starch
and
contains
almost
no
fat
nor
protein
to
be
perfect
rice
should
be
unbroken
and
uniform
in
size
and
in
order
that
it
may
be
put
on
the
market
in
this
form
the
broken
grains
are
sifted
out
these
broken
grains
are
sold
at
a
lower
price
than
the
whole
grains
but
the
only
difference
between
them
is
their
appearance
the
broken
grains
being
quite
as
nutritious
as
the
whole
grains
in
either
form
rice
is
a
comparatively
cheap
food
because
it
is
plentiful
easily
transported
and
keeps
perfectly
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
with
very
little
care
in
storage
before
rice
is
used
it
should
be
carefully
examined
and
freed
from
the
husks
that
are
apt
to
remain
in
it
then
it
should
be
washed
in
hot
water
the
water
in
which
rice
is
washed
will
have
a
milky
appearance
which
is
due
to
the
coating
that
is
put
on
in
polishing
rice
recipes
for
rice
rice
may
be
cooked
by
three
methods
each
of
which
requires
a
different
proportion
of
water
these
methods
are
which
requires
twelve
times
as
much
water
as
rice
the
which
requires
five
times
as
much
and
which
requires
two
and
times
as
much
whichever
of
these
methods
is
employed
however
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
rice
grains
when
properly
cooked
must
be
whole
and
distinct
to
give
them
this
form
and
prevent
the
rice
from
having
a
pasty
appearance
this
cereal
should
not
be
stirred
too
much
in

should
it

is
about
the
simplest
way
in

valuable
dish
itself
but
is
an
excellent
foundation
for
other
dishes
that
may
be
served
at
any
meal
the
water
in
which
rice
is
boiled
should
not
be
wasted
as
it
contains
much
nutritive
material
this
water
may
be
utilized
in
the
preparation
of

it
may
even
be
used

composition
and
varieties
as
an
article
of
food
oats
are
used
very
extensively
in
scotland
this
cereal
formed
the
principal
article
of
diet
for
many
years
and
as
the
hardiness
of
the
scotch
people
is
usually
attributed
to
their
diet
the
value
of
oats
as
a
food
can
not
be
overestimated
this
grain
or
cereal
grows
very
much
like
wheat
and
yields
an
abundant
crop
in
fairly
good
soil
but
it
is
unlike
wheat
in
composition
for
it
contains
very
little
protein
and
considerable
fat
in
fact
it
contains
more
fat
than
any
other
cereal
because
of
its
lack
of
protein
it
will
not
make
raised
bread
and
when
it
must
serve
the
purpose
of
bread
it
is
made
into
flat
cakes
and
baked
although
it
is
used
to
some
extent
in
this
way
its
greatest
use
for
food
particularly
in
the
united
states
is
in
the
form
of
and
in
the
preparation
of
oatmeal
for
the
market
the
oat
grains
are
crushed
or
cut
into
very
small
pieces
while
in
the
preparation
of
rolled
oats
they
are
crushed
flat
between
large
rollers
recipes
for
oats
the
same
methods
of
cooking
can
be
applied
to
both
oatmeal
and
rolled
oats
therefore
while
the
recipes
here
given
are
for
rolled
oats
it
will
be
well
to
note
that
they
can
be
used
for
oatmeal
by
merely
substituting
this
cereal
wherever
rolled
oats
are
mentioned
rolled
because
of
the
high

this
cereal
is
excellent
for

especially
when
it
is
served
with

barley
origin
and
use
barley
is
a
grain
or
cereal
that
grows
very
much
like
wheat
however
it
is
hardier
than
wheat
or
any
other
cereals
and
may
be
grown
through
a
greater
range
of
climates
barley
has
been
cultivated
from
the
most
ancient
times
in
fact
its
cultivation
can
be
traced
as
far
back
as
man
occupations
have
been
recorded
the
grain
of
this
cereal
has
also
played
an
important
part
in
the
advancement
of
man
for
according
to
history
some
of
the
present
weights
and
measures
originated
from
it
thus
the
troy
weight
grain
is
said
to
have
been
first
fixed
by
finding
the
average
weight
of
a
barley
grain
and
the
inch
of
linear
measure
by
placing
three
grains
of
barley
end
to
end
although
several
varieties
of
barley
have
been
cultivated
as
food
from
the
earliest
times
the
grain
is
now
used
principally
in
the
manufacture
of
malt
in
this
form
it
is
used
for
the
malting
of
foods
and
in
the
making
of
alcoholic
liquors
to
produce
malt
the
barley
grains
are
moistened
and
allowed
to
sprout
and
during
this
process
of
sprouting
the
starch
of
the
barley
is
changed
to
sugar
the
grains
are
then
dried
and
the
sprouts
which
are
called
are
broken
off
and
sold
as
cattle
food
the
grain
that
remains
which
is
really
is
then
crushed
and
combined
with
other
grains
for
use
as
malted
cereal
food
when
barley
is
used
to
make
malt
or
fermented
liquors
it
is
soaked
in
water
which
absorbs
the
sugar
in
it
then
yeast
is
added
and
this
produces
alcohol
by
causing
the
fermentation
of
the
sugar
in
the
united
states
is
the
name
applied
to
the
most
common
form
of
barley
used
as
food
in
this
form
the
layer
of
bran
is
removed
from
the
outside
of
the
barley
grain
but
no
change
is
made
in
the
grain
itself
pearl
barley
is
used
for
soups
and
as
a
breakfast
cereal
but
for
whatever
purpose
it
is
employed
it
requires
very
long
cooking
to
make
it
palatable
very
often
the
water
in
which
a
small
amount
of
pearl
barley
has
been
cooked
for
a
long
time
is
used
to
dilute

who
is
not

recipes
for

pearl
as

possibly
the
only
satisfactory
way
in
which
to
prepare
pearl
barley
is
to
cook
it
in
a
double
boiler
although
after
it
is
cooked
in
this
way
it
may
of
course
be
used
to
prepare
other
breakfast
dishes
barley
is
not
liked
by
everybody
nevertheless
it
is
an
excellent
food
and
its
nature
is
such
that
even
after
long
cooking
it
remains
so
firm
as
to
require
thorough
mastication

it
is
usually
necessary
to
add
something
such

rye
buckwheat

rye
is
a
grain
that
grows
very
much
like
wheat
but
it
can
be
cultivated
in
poorer
soil
and
colder
climates
than
this
cereal
it
is
not
used
alone
to
any
great
extent
for
anything
except
the
making
of
bread
but
it
is
particularly
well
adapted
for
this
purpose
since
it
contains
a
large
amount
of
gluten
the
food
substance
necessary
for
successful
bread
making
and
like
wheat
will
make
yeast
bread
when
used

bread
made
of
rye
flour
has
a
dark
color
and
a
peculiar
flavor
and
while
these
characteristics
make
it
unpopular
with
some
persons
it
is
used
extensively
by
certain
classes

buckwheat
is
used
less
extensively
than
any
of
the
other
cereals
already
mentioned
but
it
has
an
advantage
over
them
in
that
it
thrives
in
soil
that
is
too
poor
for
any
other
crop
the
buckwheat
plant
grows
to
a
height
of
about
feet
and
blossoms
with
a
white
flower
its
seeds
which
are
in
shape
bear
a
close
resemblance
to
beechnuts
and
because
of
this
peculiar
similarity
this
cereal
was
originally
called
practically
the
only
use
to
which
buckwheat
is
put
is
to
grind
it
into
very
fine
flour
for
griddle
cakes

for
which
are
given
in
another
section
millet
as
a
cereal
food
finds
practically
no
use
in
the
united
states
in
fact
in
this
country
it
is
grown
almost
exclusively
for
cattle
food
the
stalk
of
the
plant
being
large
and
juicy
and
containing
a
considerable
amount
of
food
the
seed
of
this
plant
furnishes
the
smallest
grain
known
for
use
as
food
and
because
of
its
size
it
is
very
hard
to
gather
millet
however
is
used
extensively
by
some
of
the
people
of
southern
asia
and
india
who
depend
on
it
very
largely
since
in
some
localities
it
forms
their
only
cereal
food
in
these
countries
it
is
ground
into
flour
and
used
for
making
bread
prepared
or
cereals
all
the
cereals
that
have
been
discussed
up
to
this
point
require
cooking
but
there
are
many
varieties
of
cereal
food
on
the
market
that
are
ready
to
eat
and
therefore
need
no
further
preparation
chief
among
these
are
the
cereal
foods
known
as
these
are
first
made
by
cooking
the
grain
then
rolling
it
between
rollers
and
finally
toasting
it
the
grains
that
are
treated
in
this
way
for
the
preparation
of
flake
foods
are
wheat
corn
rye
and
rice
it
is
well
to
remember
this
fact
because
the
trade
name
does
not
always
indicate
the
kind
of
grain
that
has
been
used
to
make
the
food
in
another
form
in
which
cereals
principally
wheat
appear
on
the
market
they
are
cooked
shredded
pressed
into
biscuits
and
then
toasted
again
cereals
are
made
into
loaves
with
the
use
of
yeast
like
bread
and
after
being
thoroughly
baked
are
ground
into
small
pieces
wheat
generally
forms
the
basis
of
these
preparations
and
to
it
are
added
such
other
grains
as
rye
and
barley
the
toasting
of
cereals
improves
their
flavor
very
materially
and
at
the
same
time
increases
their
digestibility
in
fact
cereals
that
have
been
subjected
to
this
process
are
said
to
be
predigested
because
the
starch
granules
that
have
been
browned
in
the
toasting
are
changed
into
and
this
is
one
of
the
stages
through
which
they
must
pass
in
their
process
of
digestion
in
the
body
however
the
housewife
should
not
allow
herself
to
be
influenced
unduly
by
what
is
said
about
all
prepared
cereals
because
the
manufacturer
who
has
depended
largely
on
advertising
for
the
sale
of
his
product
sometimes
becomes
slightly
overzealous
and
makes
statements
that
will
bear
questioning
for
instance
some
of
these
foods
are
claimed
to
be
muscle
builders
but
every
one
should
remember
that
with
the
exception
of
rye
and
wheat
which
build
up
the
tissues
to
a
certain
extent
the
cereals
strengthen
the
muscles
in
only
a
slight
degree
others
of
these
foods
are
said
to
be
nerve
and
brain
foods
but
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
no
food
acts
directly
on
the
nerves
or
the
brain
in
reality
only
those
foods
which
keep
the
body
mentally
and
physically
in
good
condition
have
an
effect
on
the
nerves
and
the
brain
and
this
at
best
is
an
indirect
effect
serving
cereals
although
as
is
shown
by
the
recipes
that
have
been
given
cereals
may
have
a
place
in
practically
all
meals
that
the
housewife
is
called
on
to
prepare
they
are
used
more
frequently
for
breakfast
than
for
any
other
meal
when
a
cereal
forms
a
part
of
this
meal
it
should
as
a
rule
be
served
immediately
after
the
fruit
provided
the
breakfast
is
served
in
courses
many
persons
of
course
like
fresh
fruit
served
with
cooked
or
dry
cereal
and
in
such
an
event
the
fruit
and
cereal
courses
should
be
combined
a
banana
sliced
over
flakes
or
a
few
spoonfuls
of
berries
or
sliced
peaches
placed
on
top
afford
a
pleasing
change
from
the
usual
method
of
serving
cereals
another
way
in
which
to
lend
variety
to
the
cereal
and
at
the
same
time
add
nourishment
to
the
diet
is
to
serve
a
poached
egg
on
top
of
the
biscuit
or
in
a
nest
of
corn
flakes
especially
if
they
have
been
previously
heated
in
fact
any
of
the
dry
cereals
become
more
appetizing
if
they
are
heated
thoroughly
in
a
slow
oven
and
then
allowed
to
cool
as
this
process
freshens
them
by
driving
off
the
moisture
that
they
absorb
and
that
makes
them
tough
to
add
to
both
dry
and
cooked
cereals
protein
and
fat
or
the
food
elements
in
which
they
are
not
so
high
milk
or
cream
is
usually
served
with
them
of
these
dairy
products
which
may
be
served
hot
or
cold
milk
adds
more
protein
than
cream
and
cream
more
fat
than
milk
some
persons
however
who
do
not
care
for
milk
and
cream
or
can
not
take
them
substitute
a
little
butter
for
them
or
find
fruit
juice
a
very
good
accompaniment
especially
to
a
dry
cereal
sugar
is
generally
served
with
both
kinds
of
cereals
as
the
majority
of
persons
prefer
them
slightly
sweet
but
there
is
no
logical
reason
for
its
use
except
to
add
flavor
italian
pastes
preparation
varieties
and
composition
in
addition
to
the
cereals
that
have
already
been
discussed
macaroni
and
foods
of
a
similar
nature
are
entitled
to
a
place
in
this
section
because
they
are
made
from
wheat
flour
and
are
therefore
truly
cereal
products
these
foods
which
are
commonly
referred
to
as
italian
pastes
originated
in
italy
in
that
country
they
were
made
from
a
flour
called
which
is
derived
from
a
native
wheat
that
is
very
hard
and
contains
more
protein
than
is
required
for
the
making
of
ordinary
dough
mixtures
later
when
the
manufacture
of
these
foods
was
taken
up
in
the
united
states
the
flour
for
them
had
to
be
imported
from
italy
but
it
has
since
been
discovered
that
flour
made
from
the
variety
of
wheat
called
which
is
grown
in
the
territory
of
this
country
can
be
used
for
producing
these
pastes
in
fact
this
kind
of
flour
has
proved
to
be
so
successful
that
it
now
takes
the
place
of
what
was
formerly
imported
to
produce
the
italian
pastes
the
wheat
from
which
the
bran
has
been
removed
is
ground
into
flour
this
flour
is
made
into
a
stiff
dough
which
is
rolled
into
sheets
and
forced
over
rods
usually
of
metal
or
made
into
a
mass
and
forced
over
rods
and
allowed
to
dry
in
the
air
when
sufficiently
dry
the
rods
are
removed
leaving
slender
tubes
or
sticks
that
have
holes
through
the
center
because
of
the
manufacturing
processes
involved
in
the
production
of
these
foods
for
market
they
are
higher
in
price
than
some
cereals
but
their
value
lies
in
the
fact
that
they
are
practically
imperishable
and
are
easily
prepared
and
digested
italian
pastes
are
of
several
varieties
chief
among
which
are
and
macaroni
is
the
largest
in
circumference
spaghetti
a
trifle
smaller
and
vermicelli
very
small
and
without
a
hole
through
the
center
these
pastes
and
variations
of
them
are
made
from
the
same
dough
therefore
the
tests
for
determining
the
quality
of
one
applies
to
all
of
them
these
tests
pertain
to
their
color
the
way
in
which
they
break
and
the
manner
in
which
they
cook
to
be
right
they
should
be
of
an
even
creamy
color
if
they
look
gray
or
are
white
or
streaked
with
white
they
are
of
inferior
quality
when
they
are
broken
into
pieces
they
should
break
off
perfectly
straight
if
they
split
up
lengthwise
they
contain
weak
places
due
to
streaks
all
the
varieties
should
upon
boiling
hold
their
shape
and
double
in
size
in
case
they
break
into
pieces
and
flatten
they
are
of
poor
quality
since
the
italian
pastes
are
made
from
wheat
their
food
substances
are
similar
to
those
of
wheat
as
in
other
wheat
products
protein
is
found
in
them
in
the
form
of
gluten
but
owing
to
the
variety
of
wheat
used
for
them
it
occurs
in
greater
proportion
in
these
foods
than
in
most
wheat
products
in
fact
the
italian
pastes
are
so
high
in
protein
or
material
that
they
very
readily
take
the
place
of
meat
unlike
meat
however
they
contain
carbohydrates
in
the
form
of
wheat
starch
they
do
not
contain
much
fat
or
mineral
salts
though
being
lower
in
these
food
substances
than
many
of
the
other
foods
made
from
wheat
recipes
for
italian
pastes
in
nearly
all
recipes
for
macaroni
spaghetti
and
vermicelli
as
well
as
the
numerous
varieties
of
these
foods
the
first
steps
in
their
preparation
for
the
table
are
practically
the
same
for
all
of
these
foods
must
be
cooked
to
a
certain
point
and
in
a
certain
way
before
they
can
be
used
in
the
numerous
ways
possible
to
prepare
them
therefore
in
order
that
success
may
be
met
in
the
preparation
of
the
dishes
that
are
made
from
these
foods
these
underlying
principles
should
be
thoroughly
understood
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
while
the
time
required
to
cook
the
italian
pastes
depends
on
their
composition
and
dryness
the
average
length
of
time
is
about
minutes
another
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
they
should
always
be
put
to
cook
in
boiling
water
that
contains
teaspoonfuls
of
salt
to
each
cupful
of
macaroni
spaghetti
or
vermicelli
and
that
they
should
be
kept
boiling
until
the
cooking
is
done
for
if
the
pieces
are
not
in
constant
motion
they
will
settle
and
burn
tests
may
be
applied
to
determine
whether
these
foods
have
been
cooked
sufficiently
thus
if
a
fork
passes
through
them
easily
or
they
crush
readily
on
being
pressed
between
the
fingers
and
the
thumb
they
are
done
but
as
long
as
they
feel
hard
and
elastic
they
have
not
cooked
enough
in
the
majority
of
recipes
here
given
macaroni
is
specified
but
spaghetti
vermicelli
or
any
of
the
fancy
italian
pastes
may
be
substituted
for
the
macaroni
if
one
of
them
is
preferred
it
should
also
be
remembered
that
any
of
these
when
cut
into
small
pieces
may
be
used
in
soups
or
served
with
sauce
or
gravy
macaroni
with
cream
possibly
the
simplest
way
in
which
to
prepare
macaroni
is
with
cream
sauce
as
is
explained
in
the
accompanying
recipe
such
a
sauce
not
only
increases
the
food
value
of
any
italian
paste
but
improves
its
flavor
macaroni
prepared
in
this
way
may
be
used
as
the
principal
dish
of
a

it

requirements
importance
of
bread
as
food
bread
is
sometimes
defined
as
any
form
of
baked
flour
but
as
the
word
is
commonly
understood
it
means
only
those
forms
of
baked
flour
which
contain
some
leavening
substance
that
produces
fermentation
the
making
of
bread
has
come
down
through
the
ages
from
the
simplest
methods
practiced
by
the
most
primitive
peoples
to
the
more
elaborate
processes
of
the
present
day
in
truth
to
study
the
history
of
bread
making
would
amount
to
studying
the
accounts
of
the
progress
that
has
been
made
by
the
human
race
still
in
order
that
the
production
of
bread
from
suitable
ingredients
may
be
fully
understood
it
will
be
well
to
note
the
advancement
that
has
been
made
in
the
earliest
times
what
was
used
as
bread
was
made
in
much
the
same
way
as
it
is
today
by
many
uncivilized
and
semicivilized
people
the
grain
was
ground
between
stones
usually
by
hand
and
then
mixed
with
water
to
form
a
dough
then
this
dough
was
formed
into
flat
compact
cakes
and
baked
in
hot
ashes
the
result
being
a
food
very
difficult
to
digest
later
on
some
one
discovered
that
by
allowing
the
dough
to
stand
until
fermentation
took
place
and
then
mixing
it
with
new
dough
the
whole
mass
would
rise
and
also
that
by
subjecting
this
mass
to
the
action
of
heat
that
is
baking
it
the
mass
would
be
held
in
place
and
become
a
loaf
of
raised
bread
that
was
lighter
and
of
course
more
digestible
it
was
this
discovery
that
led
up
to
the
modern
processes
in
which
substances
known
as
or
are
used
to
make
bread
light
or
porous
chief
among
the
substances
is
yeast
a
microscopic
plant
that
produces
fermentation
under
favorable
conditions
indeed
so
important
is
this
ferment
that
in
the
united
states
whenever
the
term
is
used
alone
it
means
or
whereas
when
other
leavening
agents
are
used
the
bread
is
referred
to
as
or
as
is
fully
explained
in
another
section
it
will
be
well
to
note
this
fact
for
in
all
cases
throughout
these
cookery
lessons
yeast
or
leavened
bread
is
always
meant
when
the
term
bread
is
used
alone
references
in
the
history
of
the
ancient
hebrews
show
that
bread
made
light
by
means
of
fermentation
was
known
thousands
of
years
ago
but
it
was
not
until
after
the
accidental
discovery
of
the
action
of
yeast
that
the
making
of
wholesome
and
digestible
bread
became
possible
through
this
important
advance
in
the
making
of
bread
came
a
demand
for
better
grains
and
more
improved
methods
of
making
flour
indeed
so
much
attention
has
been
given
to
these
matters
that
at
present
the
three
important
processes
relating
to
the
raising
of
wheat
the
milling
of
flour
and
the
manufacture
of
yeast
are
carefully
and
scientifically
performed
these
industries
together
with
the
commercial
manufacture
of
bread
occupy
an
important
place
in
the
business
of
practically
all
civilized
nations
among
people
who
are
not
highly
civilized
bread
forms
the
chief
article
of
food
and
often
almost
the
entire
diet
even
at
the
present
time
but
as
man
progresses
in
civilization
he
seems
to
require
a
greater
variety
of
food
and
he
accordingly
devises
means
of
getting
it
since
bread
is
only
one
of
the
many
foods
he
finds
at
his
disposal
it
does
not
assume
a
place
of
so
much
importance
in
meals
as
it
formerly
did
however
it
still
makes
up
a
sufficient
proportion
of
the
food
of
every
family
to
warrant
such
careful
and
extensive
study
as
well
as
such
mastery
of
the
processes
involved
that
the
housewife
may
present
to
her
family
only
the
best
quality
of
this
food
although
it
does
not
have
such
extensive
use
as
it
had
in
the
past
bread
of
some
description
whether
in
the
form
of
loaves
biscuits
or
rolls
forms
a
part
of
each
meal
in
every
household
this
fact
proves
that
with
the
exception
of
milk
it
is
more
frequently
eaten
than
any
other
food
a
food
so
constantly
used
contributes
very
largely
to
the
family
health
if
it
is
properly
made
however
there
is
possibly
nothing
in
the
whole
range
of
domestic
life
that
so
disturbs
the
welfare
of
the
entire
family
as
an
inferior
quality
of
this
food
which
besides
proving
detrimental
to
the
digestion
adds
materially
to
the
household
expense
of
course
in
many
bakeries
bread
of
an
excellent
quality
is
made
in
a
perfectly
hygienic
manner
and
to
be
able
to
procure
such
bread
is
a
wonderful
help
to
the
busy
housewife
or
to
the
woman
who
finds
it
inconvenient
to
make
her
own
bread
still
practically
every
person
enjoys
bread
so
much
more
than
what
is
made
commercially
that
the
housewife
will
do
well
to
make
a
careful
study
of
this
branch
of
cookery
if
it
is
properly
understood
it
will
not
be
found
difficult
but
the
woman
who
takes
it
up
must
manifest
her
interest
to
master
a
few
essential
principles
and
to
follow
them
explicitly
after
she
has
obtained
the
knowledge
that
she
must
possess
experience
and
practice
will
give
her
the
skill
necessary
to
prevent
poor
results
and
a
consequent
waste
of
material
ingredients
for
bread
making
ingredients
required
possibly
the
first
essential
to
a
correct
knowledge
of
bread
making
is
familiarity
with
the
ingredients
required
these
are
few
in
number
being
merely
flour
liquid
which
may
be
either
milk
or
water
sugar
salt
and
yeast
but
the
nature
of
these
particularly
the
flour
and
the
yeast
is
such
as
to
demand
careful
consideration
it
will
be
admitted
that
the
more
the
housewife
knows
about
materials
and
processes
the
greater
will
be
her
success
in
this
work
likewise
it
is
extremely
important
that
this
food
be
made
just
as
wholesome
as
possible
for
next
to
milk
and
eggs
bread
ranks
as
a
perfect
food
containing
all
the
elements
necessary
for
the
growth
of
the
body
this
does
not
mean
though
that
any
of
these
foods
used
as
the
sole
article
of
diet
would
be
ideal
but
that
each
one
of
them
is
of
such
composition
that
it
alone
would
sustain
life
for
a
long
period
of
time
flour
grains
used
for
as
has
been
pointed
out
elsewhere
numerous
grains
are
raised
by
man
but
only
two
of
them
namely
wheat
and
rye
are
used
alone
for
the
making
of
yeast
or
leavened
bread
the
other
grains
such
as
corn
rice
and
oats
produce
a
flat
unleavened
cake
so
they
are
seldom
used
for
bread
making
unless
they
are
mixed
with
white
flour
wheat
and
rye
have
been
used
for
bread
making
for
a
very
long
time
and
their
universal
use
today
is
due
to
the
fact
that
they
contain
considerable
protein
in
the
form
of
this
is
the
substance
that
produces
elasticity
in
the
dough
mixture
a
condition
that
is
absolutely
essential
in
the
making
of
raised
bread
in
fact
the
toughness
and
elasticity
of
bread
dough
are
what
make
it
possible
for
the
dough
to
catch
and
hold
air
and
gas
and
thus
produce
a
light
porous
loaf
of
these
two
grains
rye
is
used
less
extensively
in
the
united
states
for
the
making
of
bread
than
wheat
although
in
some
countries
particularly
the
inland
countries
of
continental
europe
considerable
use
is
made
of
it
its
limited
use
here
is
undoubtedly
due
to
the
fact
that
when
rye
is
used
alone
it
makes
a
moist
sticky
bread
which
is
considered
undesirable
by
most
persons
the
reason
for
this
is
that
although
rye
contains
a
sufficient
quantity
of
gluten
this
substance
is
not
of
the
proper
quality
to
make
the
elastic
dough
that
produces
a
light
spongy
loaf
therefore
when
rye
is
used
wheat
flour
is
generally
mixed
with
it
the
result
is
a
bread
having
a
good
texture
but
the
dark
color
and
the
typical
flavor
that
rye
produces
wheat
the
other
grain
used
for
bread
making
is
an
annual
grass
of
unknown
origin
it
is
used
more
extensively
for
food
than
any
other
grain
in
fact
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
average
quantity
consumed
by
each
person
is
about
bushels
a
year
and
of
this
amount
by
far
the
greater
part
is
used
in
the
making
of
bread
since
so
much
of
this
grain
is
used
as
food
considerable
time
and
effort
have
been
spent
in
developing
those
qualities
which
are
most
desirable
for
the
purpose
to
which
wheat
is
put
and
in
perfecting
the
processes
whereby
wheat
flour
of
a
good
quality
may
be
obtained
this
grain
is
particularly
well
adapted
for
bread
making
because
of
the
nature
of
the
proteins
it
contains
and
the
relative
proportions
of
these
these
proteins
which
occur
in
the
wheat
grain
in
the
form
of
gluten
are
known
as
and
the
gliadin
imparts
elasticity
and
tenacity
or
toughness
to
the
gluten
and
the
glutenin
gives
it
strength
it
is
not
however
so
much
the
quantity
of
gluten
in
the
wheat
grain
that
actually
determines
the
quality
of
flour
as
the
fact
that
the
two
varieties
must
be
present
in
the
proper
proportions
in
order
for
the
gluten
to
have
the
properties
desired
for
bread
making
wheat
consists
of
numerous
varieties
but
only
two
of
these
are
grown
and
used
in
the
united
states
namely
or
and
or
spring
or
hard
wheat
is
so
named
because
it
is
sown
in
the
spring
of
the
year
and
is
very
tough
or
firm
before
this
variety
was
known
the
wheat
used
for
bread
making
was
not
ideal
and
the
efforts
that
were
made
to
produce
a
grain
that
would
be
suitable
for
this
purpose
resulted
in
this
variety
to
obtain
its
particular
composition
spring
wheat
must
be
grown
under
suitable
climatic
and
soil
conditions
in
north
america
it
grows
in
the
north
central
part
of
the
united
states
and
along
the
southern
border
of
canada
this
variety
which
is
harvested
in
the
late
summer
is
characterized
by
a
large
proportion
of
gluten
and
a
correspondingly
small
amount
of
starch
it
is
the
presence
of
the
gluten
that
accounts
for
the
hardness
of
the
grain
and
the
tough
elastic
quality
of
the
dough
made
from
the
flour
bread
dough
to
be
right
must
have
this
quality
so
that
the
flour
made
from
spring
wheat
is
used
almost
exclusively
for
bread
whereas
for
cake
and
pastry
which
should
have
a
tender
unelastic
texture
flour
made
from
soft
wheat
is
more
satisfactory
winter
or
soft
wheat
derives
its
name
from
the
fact
that
it
is
planted
in
the
autumn
and
is
soft
in
texture
it
is
of
less
importance
in
the
making
of
bread
than
spring
or
hard
wheat
but
it
is
the
kind
that
has
been
grown
for
centuries
and
from
which
the
varieties
of
spring
wheat
have
been
cultivated
it
is
a
softer
grain
than
spring
wheat
because
it
contains
less
gluten
and
more
starch
the
flour
made
from
it
does
not
produce
so
elastic
a
dough
mixture
as
does
that
made
from
the
other
variety
of
wheat
consequently
the
finished
product
such
as
bread
rolls
is
likely
to
be
more
tender
and
more
friable
or
crumbly
it
is
for
this
reason
that
winter
or
soft
wheat
is
not
used
extensively
for
bread
but
is
employed
for
pastry
flour
or
mixed
with
spring
wheat
to
make
what
is
called

which
may
be
used
for
all
purposes
structure
of
wheat
in
its
natural
state
wheat
contains
all
the
food
substances
required
for
the
nourishment
of
the
human
body
in
nearly
the
proper
proportions
and
in
addition
it
has
in
its
composition
sufficient
cellulose
to
give
it
considerable
bulk
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
average

of
this

is

so
that
the
composition
of
wheat
and
the
making
of
wheat
flour
may
be
more
clearly
understood
it
will
be
well
to
observe
the
structure
of
a
grain
or
kernel
of
wheat
which
is
shown
greatly
enlarged
in
fig
at
is
shown
the
germ
of
the
young
plant
which
remains
undeveloped
until
the
grain
is
planted
this
part
contains
practically
all
the
fat
found
in
the
grain
some
starch
and
a
small
quantity
of
protein
at
is
shown
the
inside
of
the
kernel
or
the
as
it
is
called
which
is
composed
of
starch
granules
interlaced
with
protein
and
mineral
salts
surrounding
these
as
at
is
a
layer
of
coarse
cells
that
contain
mineral
matter
and
protein
and
between
these
cells
and
the
outer
husk
as
at
e
and
are
layers
of
bran
which
are
composed
of
cellulose
and
contain
mineral
salts
and
small
quantities
of
starch
and
protein
enveloping
the
entire
kernel
is
a
husk
or
bran
covering
this
forms
a
protection
to
the
rest
of
the
grain
but
it
can
not
be
used
as
food
because
it
is
composed
almost
entirely
of
cellulose
which
is
practically
indigestible
the
center
of
the
grain
or
the
heart
is
the
softest
part
and
consists
of
cells
filled
with
starch
from
this
soft
center
the
contents
of
the
grain
gradually
grow
harder
toward
the
outside
the
harder
part
and
that
containing
the
most
gluten
occurring
next
to
the
bran
covering
milling
of
wheat
great
advances
have
been
made
in
the
production
of
flour
from
wheat
and
these
are
very
good
evidence
of
man
progress
in
the
way
of
invention
the
earliest
method
consisted
in
crushing
the
grain
by
hand
between
two
stones
and
from
this
crude
device
came
the
mortar
and
pestle
a
little
later
millstones
in
the
form
of
thick
heavy
disks
were
brought
into
use
for
grinding
grain
two
of
these
stones
were
placed
so
that
their
surfaces
came
together
the
lower
one
being
stationary
and
the
upper
one
made
to
revolve
early
grinding
apparatus
of
this
kind
was
turned
by
human
power
but
this
kind
of
power
was
first
displaced
by
domestic
animals
and
later
by
wind
and
water
out
of
this
arrangement
which
is
still
used
to
some
extent
in
small
mills
has
grown
the
complicated
machinery
of
the
roller
process
by
which
any
part
of
the
grain
may
be
included
or
rejected
in
the
roller
process
the
grain
is
crushed
between
metal
rolls
instead
of
being
ground
between
stones
it
is
first
screened
in
order
to
separate
all
foreign
matter
from
it
and
then
stored
in
bins
when
it
is
taken
from
these
receptacles
it
is
put
through
another
cleaning
process
called
or
it
is
thoroughly
washed
and
dried
in
order
to
loosen
the
dirt
that
clings
to
it
and
to
free
it
entirely
from
dust
lint
etc
as
soon
as
it
is
completely
cleansed
it
is
softened
by
heat
and
moisture
and
then
passed
through
a
set
of
corrugated
rollers
which
are
adjustable
as
are
the
rubber
rollers
of
a
clothes
wringer
and
which
flatten
and
break
the
grains
after
this
first
crushing
some
of
the
bran
is
sifted
out
while
the
main
portion
of
the
grain
is
put
through
another
set
of
rollers
and
crushed
more
finely
during
the
milling
these
processes
of
crushing
the
grain
and
removing
the
bran
are
repeated
from
six
to
nine
times
each
pair
of
rollers
being
set
somewhat
closer
than
the
pair
before
until
the
grain
is
pulverized
after
the
grain
has
been
thus
reduced
to
a
powder
it
is
passed
through
bolting
cloth
which
acts
as
a
very
fine
sieve
and
separates
from
it
any
foreign
material
that
may
remain
the
result
is
a
very
fine
white
flour
graham
sometimes
the
entire
grain
including
the
bran
germ
is
ground
fine
enough
merely
for
baking
purposes
and
is
used
as
flour
in
this
form
such
flour
is
called
graham
flour
it
contains
all
the
nutriment
mineral
matter
and
cellulose
of
the
original
grain
and
is
therefore
considered
valuable
as
food
however
the
objection
to
this
kind
of
flour
is
that
its
keeping
quality
is
not
so
good
as
that
of
the
kinds
from
which
the
germ
has
been
removed
because
the
fat
contained
in
the
germ
is
liable
to
become
rancid
the
best
grades
of
fine
white
flour
make
bread
of
excellent
quality
but
such
bread
is
not
so
nutritious
as
that
made
from
flour
in
the
making
of
this
kind
of
flour
some
of
the
choicest
varieties
of
wheat
are
first
moistened
in
order
to
soften
the
woody
fiber
of
the
bran
and
are
then
sifted
until
the
outer
husk
of
the
grain
is
removed
after
this
treatment
the
grains
are
dried
and
then
pulverized
into
various
grades
of
flour
the
name
flour
is
misleading
because
it
implies
that
all
of
the
grain
is
used
whereas
since
several
of
the
outer
layers
of
bran
and
the
germ
are
removed
in
its
production
flour
is
merely
flour
in
which
practically
all
the
gluten
and
the
starch
are
retained
because
this
variety
is
not
sifted
as
are
the
white
flours
it
is
not
so
fine
as
they
are
but
it
is
not
so
coarse
as
graham
flour
nor
is
bread
made
from
it
so
dark
in
color
both
graham
and
flours
produce
a
more
wholesome
bread
than
any
of
the
varieties
of
white
flour
because
they
contain
more
of
the
nutritive
elements
and
mineral
salts
which
are
necessary
in
the
diet
the
bran
that
is
retained
in
them
is
not
used
by
the
body
as
food
but
it
adds
bulk
to
the
diet
and
assists
in
carrying
on
the
normal
functions
of
the
digestive
tract
selection
of
if
a
large
quantity
of
flour
must
be
bought
at
one
time
as
for
instance
enough
to
last
through
an
entire
season
it
is
advisable
to
test
it
carefully
before
the
purchase
is
made
so
as
to
avoid
the
danger
of
getting
a
poor
grade
as
a
rule
however
housewives
are
obliged
to
purchase
only
a
small
quantity
at
a
time
in
such
cases
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
test
the
flour
before
purchasing
it
provided
a
standard
make
is
selected
very
often
too
a
housewife
in
a
small
family
finds
it
inconvenient
to
keep
on
hand
a
supply
of
both
bread
flour
and
pastry
flour
in
such
an
event
a
blend
flour
which
as
has
been
mentioned
is
a
mixture
of
flour
made
from
spring
and
winter
wheat
that
will
do
for
all
purposes
is
the
kind
to
purchase
while
such
flour
is
not
ideal
for
either
bread
or
pastry
it
serves
the
purpose
of
both
very
well
quality
of
flour
is
put
on
the
market
in
various
grades
and
is
named
according
to
its
quality
the
highest
grade
or
best
quality
is
called
the
next
grade
and
the
next
the
lowest
grade
or
poorest
quality
is
called
this
grade
is
seldom
sold
for
food
purposes
but
it
is
used
considerably
for
the
making
of
paste
the
quality
of
flour
used
in
bread
making
is
of
very
great
importance
because
flour
of
poor
quality
will
not
of
course
make
good
bread
every
housewife
should
therefore
be
familiar
with
the
characteristics
of
good
flour
and
should
buy
accordingly
several
tests
can
be
applied
to
flour
to
determine
its
kind
and
its
quality
the
first
test
is
its
color
bread
flour
or
flour
made
from
spring
wheat
is
usually
of
a
color
while
pastry
flour
or
that
made
from
winter
wheat
is
more
nearly
pure
white
in
color
a
dark
or
gray
color
indicates
that
the
flour
is
poor
in
quality
the
second
test
is
the
feel
of
the
flour
a
pinch
of
good
bread
flour
when
rubbed
lightly
between
the
thumb
and
the
index
finger
will
be
found
to
be
rather
coarse
and
the
particles
will
feel
sharp
and
gritty
when
good
pastry
flour
is
treated
in
the
same
way
it
will
feel
smooth
and
powdery
the
third
test
is
its
adhering
power
when
squeezed
tightly
in
the
hand
good
bread
flour
holds
together
in
a
mass
and
retains
slightly
the
impression
of
the
fingers
poor
bread
flour
treated
in
the
same
way
either
does
not
retain
its
shape
or
provided
it
contains
too
much
moisture
is
liable
to
make
a
damp
hard
lump
the
odor
of
flour
might
also
be
considered
a
test
flour
must
not
have
a
musty
odor
nor
any
other
odor
foreign
to
the
normal
rather
nutty
flavor
that
is
characteristic
of
flour
the
bleaching
and
adulteration
of
flour
are
governed
by
the
united
states
laws
bleaching
is
permitted
only
when
it
does
not
reduce
the
quality
or
strength
nor
conceal
any
damage
or
inferiority
such
flour
must
be
plainly
labeled
to
show
that
it
has
been
bleached
care
of
there
is
considerable
economy
in
buying
flour
in
large
quantities
but
unless
an
adequate
storing
place
can
be
secured
it
is
advisable
to
buy
only
small
amounts
at
a
time
flour
absorbs
odors
very
readily
so
that
when
it
is
not
bought
in
barrels
it
should
if
possible
be
purchased
in
bags
then
after
it
is
purchased
it
should
be
kept
where
it
will
remain
dry
and
will
not
be
accessible
to
odors
for
unless
the
storage
conditions
are
favorable
it
will
soon
acquire
an
offensive
odor
and
become
unfit
for
use
flour
sometimes
becomes
infested
with
weevils
or
beetles
whose
presence
can
be
detected
by
little
webs
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
insects
and
vermin
of
all
kinds
flour
should
be
kept
in
tightly
closed
bins
after
it
is
taken
from
the
barrels
or
sacks
in
which
it
is
purchased
if
newly
purchased
flour
is
found
to
be
contaminated
with
such
insects
it
should
be
returned
to
the
dealer
yeast
nature
and
action
of
how
yeast
came
to
be
discovered
is
not
definitely
known
but
its
discovery
is
believed
to
have
been
purely
accidental
some
mixture
of
flour
and
liquid
was
probably
allowed
to
remain
exposed
to
the
air
until
it
fermented
and
then
when
baked
was
found
to
be
light
and
porous
whatever
the
origin
of
this
discovery
was
it
is
certain
that
yeast
was
used
hundreds
of
years
ago
and
that
its
action
was
not
at
that
time
understood
even
at
the
present
time
everything
concerning
the
action
of
yeast
is
not
known
still
continued
study
and
observation
have
brought
to
light
enough
information
to
show
that
yeast
is
the
agency
that
under
favorable
conditions
produces
light
spongy
bread
out
of
a
flour
mixture
it
has
been
determined
that
yeast
is
a
microscopic
plant
existing
everywhere
in
the
air
and
in
dust
consequently
it
is
found
on
all
things
that
are
exposed
to
air
or
dust
in
order
that
it
may
grow
this
plant
requires
the
three
things
necessary
for
the
growth
of
any
plant
namely
food
moisture
and
warmth
carbohydrate
in
the
form
of
sugar
proves
to
be
an
ideal
food
for
yeast
and
to
degrees
fahrenheit
is
the
temperature
at
which
the
most
rapid
growth
occurs
when
these
conditions
exist
and
a
sufficient
amount
of
moisture
is
provided
yeast
grows
very
rapidly
and
produces
fermentation
the
changes
that
take
place
when
yeast
causes
fermentation
can
be
detected
very
readily
by
observing
the
fermenting
of
fruit
juice
as
every
housewife
knows
the
first
indication
of
a
ferment
in
fruit
juice
is
the
appearance
of
tiny
bubbles
which
collect
on
the
sides
and
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
containing
the
fruit
and
then
gradually
rise
to
the
top
these
bubbles
are
a
form
of
gas
called
or
if
after
they
appear
the
juice
is
tasted
it
will
be
found
to
be
slightly
alcoholic
and
to
have
a
somewhat
sour
or
acid
taste
the
gas
the
acid
and
the
alcohol
thus
produced
are
the
three
results
of
the
action
of
the
ferment
when
yeast
is
used
in
the
making
of
bread
out
of
wheat
flour
the
changes
just
mentioned
take
place
to
understand
the
action
of
this
plant
it
will
be
necessary
to
remember
that
wheat
contains
a
large
proportion
of
starch
this
substance
however
can
not
be
acted
on
by
the
yeast
plant
it
must
first
be
changed
into
sugar
the
yeast
that
is
added
to
the
flour
changes
some
of
the
starch
into
sugar
and
transforms
the
sugar
into
alcohol
and
gas
this
gas
which
is
lighter
than
the
dough
rises
and
in
its
efforts
to
escape
expands
the
elastic
glutinous
dough
into
a
mass
of
bubbles
with
thin
walls
until
the
dough
is
two
or
three
times
its
original
bulk
the
yeast
plants
though
must
be
well
distributed
throughout
the
dough
otherwise
there
are
likely
to
be
no
bubbles
in
some
places
and
large
bubbles
with
thick
walls
in
others
the
gas
thus
formed
is
prevented
from
escaping
by
the
toughness
or
the
elasticity
of
the
gluten
and
the
spaces
that
it
leaves
are
what
produce
a
light
porous
loaf
when
the
expansion
has
gone
on
long
enough
the
formation
of
gas
is
checked
and
the
ferment
is
killed
by
baking
the
dough
in
a
hot
oven
during
the
baking
the
alcohol
is
driven
off
by
heat
some
of
the
starch
is
browned
and
forms
the
crust
and
so
little
acid
is
produced
in
the
short
time
in
which
the
yeast
is
active
that
it
is
not
noticeable
commercial
when
yeast
plants
are
deprived
of
water
and
food
they
cease
to
multiply
however
under
these
conditions
they
may
be
kept
alive
so
that
when
water
and
food
are
again
provided
they
will
increase
in
number
and
carry
on
their
work
advantage
has
been
taken
of
these
characteristics
of
yeast
for
although
at
one
time
the
making
of
yeast
was
entirely
a
household
process
it
has
now
like
butter
cheese
canned
fruit
become
a
commercial
product
the
first
yeast
put
on
the
market
was
collected
from
the
surface
of
the
contents
of
vats
where
it
floated
in
large
quantities
but
as
this
was
an
impure
unreliable
product
composed
of
various
kinds
of
bacteria
it
is
no
longer
used
for
the
purpose
of
making
bread
at
present
yeast
is
carefully
grown
as
a
pure
yeast
culture
or
product
it
is
marketed
in
such
a
way
that
when
proper
food
such
as
soft
dough
or
sponge
and
a
favorable
temperature
are
provided
the
plants
will
multiply
and
act
on
the
carbohydrate
that
they
find
in
the
food
in
fact
the
purpose
of
the
process
of
setting
a
sponge
is
to
obtain
a
large
number
of
yeast
plants
from
a
few
commercial
yeast
is
placed
on
the
market
in
two
forms
and
each
of
these
yeasts
has
its
advantages
so
that
the
one
to
select
depends
on
the
method
preferred
for
the
making
of
bread
as
well
as
the
time
that
may
be
devoted
to
the
preparation
of
this
food
moist
yeast
which
is
usually
called
consists
of
the
pure
yeast
culture
or
growth
mixed
with
starch
to
make
a
sort
of
dough
and
then
compressed
into
small
cakes
the
form
in
which
it
is
sold
the
moist
condition
of
this
kind
of
commercial
yeast
keeps
the
plants
in
an
active
state
and
permits
of
very
rapid
growth
in
a
dough
mixture
consequently
it
proves
very
useful
for
the
rapid
methods
of
making
bread
it
is
soft
yet
brittle
is
of
a
color
and
has
no
odor
except
that
of
yeast
since
the
plants
of
compressed
yeast
require
very
little
moisture
to
make
them
grow
an
unfavorable
or
low
temperature
is
needed
to
keep
the
yeast
from
spoiling
in
fact
it
is
not
guaranteed
to
remain
good
longer
than
a
few
days
and
then
only
if
it
is
kept
at
a
temperature
low
enough
to
prevent
the
plants
from
growing
this
fact
makes
it
inadvisable
to
purchase
compressed
yeast
at
great
distances
from
the
source
of
supply
although
it
may
be
obtained
by
parcel
post
from
manufacturers
or
dealers
dry
yeast
the
other
form
of
commercial
yeast
is
made
in
much
the
same
way
as
moist
yeast
but
instead
of
being
mixed
with
a
small
amount
of
starch
the
yeast
culture
is
combined
with
a
large
quantity
of
starch
or
meal
and
then
dried
the
process
of
drying
kills
off
some
of
the
plants
and
renders
the
remainder
inactive
because
of
this
the
yeast
requires
no
special
care
and
will
keep
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
facts
that
account
for
its
extensive
use
by
housewives
who
are
not
within
easy
reach
of
the
markets
however
because
of
the
inactivity
of
the
yeast
plants
much
longer
time
is
required
to
produce
fermentation
in
a
bread
mixture
containing
dry
yeast
than
in
one
in
which
moist
yeast
is
used
consequently
the
long
processes
of
bread
making
are
brought
about
by
the
use
of
dry
yeast
if
moist
yeast
is
used
for
these
processes
a
smaller
quantity
is
required
liquid
some
housewives
are
so
situated
that
they
find
it
difficult
to
obtain
commercial
yeast
in
either
of
its
forms
but
this
disadvantage
need
not
deprive
them
of
the
means
of
making
good
bread
for
they
can
prepare
a
very
satisfactory
liquid
yeast
themselves
to
make
such
yeast
flour
water
and
a
small
quantity
of
sugar
are
stirred
together
and
the
mixture
is
then
allowed
to
remain
at
ordinary
room
temperature
or
degrees
fahrenheit
until
it
is
filled
with
bubbles
if
hops
are
available
a
few
of
them
may
be
added
when
such
yeast
is
added
to
a
sponge
mixture
it
will
lighten
the
whole
amount
before
the
sponge
is
made
stiff
with
flour
however
a
little
of
it
should
be
taken
out
put
in
a
covered
dish
and
set
away
in
a
cool
dark
place
for
the
next
baking
if
properly
looked
after
in
the
manner
explained
this
yeast
may
be
kept
for
about
weeks
more
certain
results
and
a
better
flavor
are
insured
in
the
use
of
liquid
yeast
if
it
is
started
with
commercial
yeast
so
that
whenever
this
can
be
obtained
it
should
be
used
then
as
just
explained
some
of
the
liquid
containing
the
yeast
or
some
of
the
sponge
made
with
it
may
be
retained
for
the
next
baking
quality
of
of
equal
importance
with
the
quality
of
flour
is
the
quality
of
yeast
used
in
the
baking
of
bread
yeast
is
of
course
accountable
for
the
lightness
or
sponginess
of
bread
but
in
addition
it
improves
the
flavor
of
the
bread
if
it
is
of
good
quality
or
detracts
from
the
flavor
if
it
is
of
poor
quality
since
the
condition
of
yeast
can
not
be
determined
until
its
effect
on
the
finished
product
is
noted
the
housewife
should
take
no
chances
but
should
employ
only
yeast
whether
she
uses
commercial
or
liquid
that
she
knows
to
be
good
and
reliable
compressed
yeast
may
be
easily
judged
as
to
quality
it
should
be
grayish
white
in
color
without
streaks
or
spots
and
it
should
have
no
sour
nor
disagreeable
odor
if
yeast
is
used
and
the
results
obtained
are
not
satisfactory
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
a
fresh
supply
should
be
prepared
yeast
aids
as
has
already
been
explained
yeast
in
order
to
grow
requires
something
on
which
to
feed
and
the
food
that
produces
the
most
rapid
growth
is
that
which
contains
carbohydrate
certain
of
the
carbohydrates
however
prove
to
be
better
food
and
produce
more
rapid
growth
than
others
and
these
which
are
known
as
yeast
aids
are
usually
added
as
ingredients
in
the
making
of
bread
the
ones
that
are
most
commonly
used
are
sugar
and
potato
water
sugar
is
almost
always
added
but
it
should
be
limited
in
quantity
because
a
dough
mixture
that
is
made
heavy
with
sugar
will
rise
very
slowly
potato
water
has
been
found
to
be
a
very
satisfactory
aid
because
the
starch
of
the
potato
is
utilized
readily
by
the
yeast
if
this
aid
is
to
be
used
the
water
in
which
potatoes
are
boiled
may
be
saved
and
when
the
ingredients
required
for
the
making
of
bread
are
mixed
it
may
be
added
as
a
part
or
all
of
the
liquid
required
if
it
is
desired
to
increase
the
amount
of
starch
in
the
potato
water
a
boiled
potato
or
two
may
be
mashed
and
added
to
it
milk
and
fat
in
bread
milk
is
sometimes
used
as
a
part
or
as
all
of
the
liquid
in
bread
while
it
adds
nutritive
value
and
is
thought
by
many
persons
to
improve
the
texture
it
is
not
absolutely
essential
to
successful
bread
making
whenever
milk
is
used
it
should
first
be
scalded
thoroughly
a
point
that
should
not
be
overlooked
in
connection
with
the
use
of
milk
is
that
the
crust
of
milk
bread
browns
more
readily
and
has
a
more
uniform
color
than
that
of
bread
in
which
water
is
used
as
liquid
like
milk
fat
adds
nutritive
value
to
bread
but
it
is
not
an
essential
ingredient
if
it
is
included
care
should
be
taken
not
to
use
too
much
for
an
excessive
amount
will
retard
the
growth
of
the
yeast
almost
any
kind
of
fat
such
as
butter
lard
or
other
clear
tasteless
fats
or
any
mixture
of
these
may
be
used
for
this
purpose
provided
it
does
not
impart
an
unpleasant
flavor
to
the
bread
proportion
of
materials
no
definite
rule
can
be
given
for
the
exact
proportion
of
liquid
and
flour
to
be
used
in
bread
making
because
some
kinds
of
flour
absorb
much
more
liquid
than
others
it
has
been
determined
however
that
cupfuls
of
flour
is
generally
needed
for
each
small
loaf
of
bread
with
this
known
the
quantity
of
flour
can
be
determined
by
the
amount
of
bread
that
is
to
be
made
the
quantity
of
liquid
required
depends
on
the
quantity
and
kind
of
flour
selected
but
usually
there
should
be
about
as
much
liquid
as
flour
the
particular
method
that
is
selected
for
the
making
of
bread
as
is
explained
later
determines
the
amount
of
yeast
to
be
used
if
it
is
desired
not
to
have
the
bread
rise
quickly
a
small
quantity
about
one
eighth
cake
of
compressed
yeast
or
tablespoonfuls
of
liquid
yeast
is
sufficient
for
each
loaf
but
if
rapid
rising
is
wanted
two
three
or
four
times
as
much
yeast
must
be
used
to
produce
a
sufficient
amount
of
carbon
dioxide
in
less
time
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
more
yeast
used
the
more
quickly
will
the
necessary
gas
be
created
and
that
as
has
already
been
shown
it
is
the
formation
of
gas
that
makes
bread
light
and
porous
in
addition
to
flour
liquid
and
yeast
teaspoonful
of
salt
tablespoonful
of

and
tablespoonful
of

the
ingredients
generally
used
for
each
loaf
of
bread

fig
necessary
not
many
utensils
are
required
for
bread
making
but
the
ones
that
are

must
be
of
the
right
kind
if
the
best
results
are
to
be
obtained
the

the
material
of
which
the
pans
are

also
receive
attention
the
loaves
will
be
found
to
bake
more
quickly
and
thoroughly
if
they
are
not
made
too
large
and
each
one
is
baked
in
a

aluminum
or

the
only
requirements
being
that
all
the
pans
used
at
one
baking
be
of
the
same
material
because
as
heat
penetrates
some
materials
more
quickly
than
others
the
baking
will
then
be
more
uniform
convenient
while
the
utensils
shown
in

are
all
that
are
actually
required
in
the
making
of
bread
a
bread
mixer
one
style
of
which
is
described
in
of
part
will

extremely
convenient
by
the
housewife
who
must
bake
large
quantities
of
bread
at
one
time
and
who
has
not
a
great
deal
of
time
to
devote
to
the
work
this
device
can
be
used
and
of
course
often
is
used
by
the
housewife
who
makes
only
a
small
quantity
of
bread
as
for
instance
two
to
four
loaves
but
it
is
not
actually
needed
by
her
as
she
can
handle
such
an
amount
easily
and
quickly
a
which
consists
of
a
framework
covered
with
wire
netting
and
supported
by
short
legs
is
also
a
convenient
utensil
as
it
serves
as
a
good
place
on
which
to
put
baked
bread
to
cool
if
one
of
these
devices
is
not
available

can
be
easily
made
by

processes

the
nature
and
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
required
to
make
bread
as
well
as
the
utensils
that
are
needed
for
this
purpose
being
understood
it
is
next
in
order
to
take
up
the
actual
work
of
making
bread
several
processes
are
included
in
this
work
namely
making
the
dough
caring
for
the
rising
dough
kneading
the
dough
shaping
the
dough
into
loaves
baking
the
loaves
and
caring
for
the
bread
after
it
is
baked
when
the
finished
product
is
obtained
the
loaves
are
ready
to
be
scored
and
served
a
knowledge
of
how
to
carry
out
these
processes
is
of
the
utmost
importance
for
much
of
the
success
achieved
in
bread
making
depends
on
the
proper
handling
of
the
ingredients
of
course
skill
in
manipulation
is
acquired
only
by
constant
practice
so
that
the
more
opportunity
the
housewife
has
to
apply
her
knowledge
of
the
processes
the
more
proficient
will
she
become
in
this
phase
of
cookery
each
one
of
the
processes
mentioned
is
here
discussed
in
the
order
in
which
it
comes
in
the
actual
work
of
bread
making
and
while
the
proper
consideration
should
be
given
to
every
one
of
them
it
will
be
well
before
entering
into
them
to
observe
the
qualities
that
characterize
good
wheat
bread
good
wheat
bread
may
be
described
in
various
ways
but
as
has
been
learned
by
experience
and
as
is
pointed
out
by
united
states
government
authorities
probably
the
best
way
in
which
to
think
of
it
so
far
as
its
structure
is
concerned
is
as
a
mass
of
tiny
bubbles
made
of
flour
and
water
having
very
thin
walls
and
fixed
in
shape
by
means
of
heat
the
size
of
the
cells
and
the
nature
of
the
bubble
walls
are
points
that
should
not
be
overlooked
each
loaf
should
be
light
in
weight
considering
its
size
should
be
regular
in
form
and
should
have
an
unbroken
crust
the
top
crust
should
be
smooth
and
should
have
a
luster
which
is
usually
spoken
of
as
the
bloom
of
the
crust
taken
as
a
whole
the
loaf
should
have
a
certain
sponginess
which
is
known
as
its
elasticity
and
which
is
evidenced
by
the
way
in
which
the
loaf
acts
when
it
is
pressed
slightly
out
of
shape
as
soon
as
the
pressure
is
removed
the
loaf
should
resume
its
original
shape
this
test
should
produce
the
same
results
when
it
is
applied
to
small
pieces
of
the
crust
and
to
the
cut
surface
of
the
loaf
the
internal
appearance
must
also
receive
consideration
to
be
right
wheat
bread
should
be
creamy
white
in
color
and
should
have
a
definite
sheen
which
can
best
be
seen
by
looking
across
a
slice
rather
than
directly
down
into
it
as
already
explained
the
holes
in
it
should
be
small
and
evenly
distributed
and
their
walls
should
be
very
thin
these
points
can
be
readily
determined
by
holding
a
very
thin
slice
up
to
the
light
the
flavor
of
bread
is
also
a
very
important
factor
but
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
describe
just
the
exact
flavor
that
bread
should
have
in
order
to
be
considered
good
probably
the
best
way
in
which
to
explain
this
is
to
say
that
its
flavor
should
be
that
which
is
brought
about
by
treating
the
wheat
with
salt
while
such
a
flavor
may
not
be
known
to
all
it
is
familiar
to
those
who
have
tasted
the
wheat
kernel
making
the
dough
preliminary
treatment
of
ingredients
the
first
step
in
bread
making
and
without
doubt
the
most
important
one
is
the
making
of
the
dough
it
consists
in
moistening
the
flour
by
means
of
a
liquid
of
some
kind
in
order
to
soften
the
gluten
and
the
starch
to
dissolve
the
sugar
and
to
cement
all
the
particles
together
and
then
combining
these
ingredients
before
the
ingredients
are
combined
however
particularly
the
flour
the
liquid
and
the
yeast
they
must
generally
be
warmed
in
order
to
shorten
the
length
of
time
necessary
for
the
yeast
to
start
growing
much
care
should
be
exercised
in
heating
these
materials
for
good
results
will
not
be
obtained
unless
they
are
brought
to
the
proper
temperature
the
flour
should
feel
warm
and
the
liquid
whether
it
be
water
or
milk
should
when
it
is
added
be
of
such
a
temperature
that
it
also
will
feel
warm
to
the
fingers
if
water
is
used
it
ought
to
be
just
as
pure
as
possible
but
if
milk
is
preferred
it
should
be
used
only
after
it
has
been
scalded
the
yeast
should
be
dissolved
in
a
small
quantity
of
lukewarm
water
hot
water
used
for
this
purpose
is
liable
to
kill
the
yeast
and
prevent
the
bread
from
rising
whereas
cold
water
will
retard
the
growth
of
the
yeast
combining
the
ingredients
as
soon
as
the
bread
ingredients
have
received
the
proper
treatment
they
are
ready
to
be
combined
combining
may
be
done
by
two
different
methods
one
of
which
is
known
as
the
and
the
other
as
the
as
their
names
indicate
these
methods
are
characterized
by
the
length
of
time
required
for
the
bread
to
rise
each
method
has
its
advantages
and
the
one
to
select
depends
on
the
amount
of
time
and
energy
the
housewife
can
afford
to
give
to
this
part
of
her
work
persons
who
use
the
long
process
believe
that
bread
made
by
it
tastes
better
and
keeps
longer
than
that
made
by
the
short
process
whereas
those
who
favor
the
short
process
find
that
it
saves
time
and
labor
and
are
convinced
that
the
quality
of
the
bread
is
not
impaired
the
more
rapid
methods
of
making
breads
are
possible
only
when
yeast
in
the
active
state
is
used
and
when
more
of
it
than
would
be
necessary
in
the
long
process
in
which
time
must
be
allowed
for
its
growth
is
employed
however
regardless
of
the
method
followed
all
bread
mixtures
must
be
begun
in
the
same
manner
the
liquids
seasonings
and
fat
are
combined
and
to
these
is
added
the
flour
which
should
be
sifted
in
as
shown
in
fig
long
by
the
long
process
there
are
two
ways
of
combining
the
ingredients
in
order
to
make
bread
one
is
known
as
the
and
the
other
as
the
illustration
fig
the
sponge
method
is
employed
when
sufficient
time
can
be
allowed
to
permit
the
natural
growth
of
the
yeast
to
make
bread
according
to
this
process
start
it
in
the
evening
by
warming
the
liquid
and
dissolving
the
yeast
and
then
adding
these
ingredients
to
the
sugar
salt
and
fat
which
should
first
be
placed
in
the
mixing
bowl
stir
this
mixture
well
and
then
add
of
the
quantity
of
flour
that
is
to
be
used
stirring
this
also
place
this
mixture
or
sponge
as
such
a
mixture
is
called
where
it
will
remain
warm
or
at
a
temperature
of
from
to
degrees
fahrenheit
through
the
night
in
the
morning
stir
the
remaining
flour
into
the
sponge
and
knead
for
a
few
minutes
the
dough
thus
formed
when
this
is
accomplished
put
the
dough
in
a
warm
place
and
allow
it
to
rise
until
it
doubles
in
bulk
when
the
dough
is
in
this
condition
it
is
ready
to
be
kneaded
again
after
which
it
may
be
shaped
into
loaves
placed
in
the
pans
allowed
to
double
in
bulk
again
and
finally
baked
the
method
is
a
shortened
form
of
the
method
just
explained
it
does
away
with
the
necessity
of
one
kneading
and
one
rising
and
consequently
saves
considerable
time
and
labor
to
make
bread
by
this
method
combine
the
ingredients
in
the
evening
as
for
the
sponge
method
but
instead
of
adding
only
half
of
the
flour
put
all
of
it
into
the
mixture
make
a
stiff
dough
at
once
and
knead
then
allow
this
to
rise
during
the
night
so
that
in
the
morning
it
can
be
kneaded
again
and
put
directly
into
the
bread
pans
after
it
rises
in
the
pans
until
it
doubles
in
bulk
it
is
ready
to
be
baked
the
only
disadvantage
of
the
method
is
that
a
stiff
dough
rises
more
slowly
than
a
sponge
but
since
the
entire
night
is
given
to
the
rising
no
difficulty
will
be
experienced
in
carrying
out
this
process
a
point
to
remember
however
is
that
dough
made
according
to
this
method
must
be
kept
warmer
than
that
made
by
the
sponge
method
quick
in
the
quick
process
of
combining
bread
ingredients
there
are
also
two
methods
of
procedure
the
and
the
the
chief
differences
between
the
methods
of
this
process
and
those
of
the
long
process
are
in
the
quantity
of
yeast
used
and
the
length
of
time
required
for
the
bread
to
rise
more
yeast
must
be
used
and
much
less
time
is
required
for
the
completion
of
the
entire
process
this
shorter
period
of
time
is
doubtless
due
to
the
fact
that
throughout
the
process
whether
the
or
the
sponge
method
is
followed
the
mixture
must
be
kept
at
a
uniform
temperature
of
about
degrees
fahrenheit
the
sponge
method
requires
only
about
hours
for
its
completion
and
the
bread
may
be
started
at
any
time
of
the
day
that
will
allow
this
amount
of
time
for
carrying
on
the
work
for
this
method
warm
the
ingredients
and
then
combine
the
sugar
salt
fat
liquid
and
dissolved
yeast
into
this
mixture
stir
enough
of
the
flour
to
make
a
sponge
and
put
it
where
it
will
keep
uniformly
warm
until
it
has
about
doubled
in
quantity
and
is
full
of
bubbles
then
add
the
remainder
of
the
flour
knead
the
mixture
and
return
the
dough
thus
formed
to
a
warm
place
when
the
dough
has
doubled
in
bulk
remove
it
from
the
bowl
to
the
kneading
board
knead
it
slightly
and
then
shape
it
into
loaves
place
these
into
the
pans
and
after
allowing
them
to
rise
sufficiently
bake
them
the
method
differs
from
the
sponge
method
in
that
the
entire
amount
of
flour
is
added
when
the
ingredients
are
first
mixed
with
the
result
that
a
stiff
dough
instead
of
a
sponge
is
formed
as
has
already
been
learned
this
stiff
dough
rises
more
slowly
than
a
sponge
but
it
requires
one
rising
less
it
must
be
kept
at
a
uniform
temperature
as
much
of
the
time
as
possible
so
that
the
rising
will
not
be
retarded
when
it
has
doubled
in
bulk
remove
it
from
the
bowl
and
knead
it
then
shape
it
into
loaves
place
these
in
the
pans
allow
them
to
rise
sufficiently
and
proceed
with
the
baking
care
of
the
rising
dough
purpose
of
rising
is
an
important
part
of
the
process
of
bread
making
no
matter
which
method
is
employed
in
a
sponge
its
purpose
is
to
blend
the
ingredients
after
they
have
been
mixed
as
well
as
to
permit
the
growth
of
the
yeast
in
a
dough
after
the
gas
has
been
evenly
distributed
by
means
of
kneading
the
purpose
of
rising
is
to
permit
the
incorporation
of
a
sufficient
quantity
of
carbon
dioxide
to
make
the
bread
light
when
it
is
baked
as
has
just
been
explained
three
risings
are
necessary
in
the
sponge
method
of
both
the
long
and
the
short
process
whereas
only
two
are
required
in
the
methods
the
last
rising
or
the
one
that
takes
place
after
the
dough
is
shaped
into
loaves
is
the
one
that
affects
the
texture
of
the
bread
most
so
that
it
should
receive
considerable
attention
if
the
dough
is
not
allowed
to
rise
sufficiently
at
this
time
the
bread
will
be
too
fine
in
texture
and
will
likely
be
heavy
and
if
it
is
permitted
to
rise
too
much
it
will
be
coarse
in
texture
allowance
however
should
be
made
for
the
fact
that
the
rising
will
continue
after
the
bread
has
been
placed
in
the
oven
temperature
for
as
has
been
mentioned
the
best
results
are
obtained
if
the
bread
dough
is
kept
at
a
uniform
temperature
throughout
its
rising
the
temperature
at
which
it
rises
most
rapidly
is
about
degrees
fahrenheit
but
unless
it
can
be
watched
closely
a
better
plan
is
to
keep
it
especially
if
the
long
process
of
bread
making
is
followed
at
a
temperature
that
runs
no
higher
than
degrees
various
methods
of
maintaining
a
uniform
temperature
have
been
devised
but
the
ones
usually
resorted
to
consist
in
placing
the
bowl
containing
the
sponge
or
the
dough
in
a
bread
raiser
a
fireless
cooker
or
a
vessel
of

satisfactory
the
temperature

degrees
fahrenheit

rising
is
desired
placing
the

a
simple

especially
desirable
for
a

be
at
a
temperature
of
about
to
degrees
fahrenheit
after
the
bowl
of

placed
in

be
covered
very
carefully

be
retained

the
hot

to
be
replenished
occasionally
if
this
is
done
the

be
maintained
at

therefore
rise
rapidly
illustration

to
insure
the
best
results
with

it
is
advisable
for
the

to
use
a
thermometer
for
determining
the

will
save
considerable

the
ideal
kind
for
use

an
aid
in
this

the
temperature
at
which

should
be
kept
for

it
may
be
considered
at

to
prevent
the
formation
of
a
hard
surface
on
the
dough
the
bowl
in
which
it
rises
should
be
kept
tightly
covered
a
further
means
of
preventing
this
condition
consists
in
oiling
the
surface
of
the
dough
that
is
brushing
it
lightly
with
melted
fat
in
case
a
crust
does
form

entirely
on
the

a
good
way
in

to
determine

is
to
put
a
small
piece
of
the

in
a
glass
such

the

an

is
a
very
good
means
of

if
neither

the
heat
may
be
tested
by
placing

a

a

a

precaution
should

just
right

the

the

will
rise
to
some
extent
even
if
the
yeast
plant
is
killed
at
once
for
the
carbon
dioxide
that
the
dough
contains
will
expand
as
it
becomes
heated
and
will
force
the
loaf
up
but
bread
baked
in
this
way
is
generally
very
unsatisfactory
because
a
hard
crust
forms
on
the
top
and
it
must
either
burst
or
retard
the
rising
of
the
loaf
if
the
heat
is
not
sufficient
the
dough
will
continue
to
rise

to

in
the

in
an
oven
that
is
just
moderately
hot
or
has
a
temperature
of
about
degrees
the
yeast
plant
will
not

quickly
the
dough
will
continue

indicate
that

a

had
been

and
dark
or

use
of
the

the
advantage
of
a
bread
mixer
in
bread
making
is
that
it
practically
does
away
with
hand
mixing
and
kneading
however
all
the
other
steps
described
are
the
same
depending
on
the
process
used
as
has
been
mentioned
the
housewife
who
bakes
such
a
small
quantity
as
three
or
four
loaves
of
bread
can
get
along
very
well
without
a
bread
mixer
at
least
for
so
few
loaves
a
bread
mixer
does
not
seem
so
necessary
as
when
six
or
more
loaves
are
to
be
made
at
one
time
when
it
is
a
decided
convenience
however
bread
mixers
can
be
had
in
various
sizes
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
housewife
in
using
a
bread
mixer
like
that
described
in
of
part
the
ingredients
are
placed
in
the
mixer
and
thoroughly
mixed
together
by
turning
the
handle
and
after
the
sponge
or
the
dough
has
risen
the
kneading
is
performed
by
again
turning
the
handle
the
amount
of
turning
to
be
done
is
of
course
regulated
by
the
ingredients
and
the
method
that
is
followed
in
addition
to
the
bread
mixer
mentioned
there
is
another
convenient
type
that
is
constructed
in
two
parts
the
top
part
having
a
sifter
in
its
bottom
through
which
the
flour
or
other
dry
ingredients
are
sifted
the
sifting
is
done
with
a
crank
which
also
operates
a
shaft
to
which
is
attached
a
number
of
knives
extending
in
different
directions
these
knives
accomplish
the
mixing
and
the
kneading
the
bread
is
allowed
to
rise
in
the
lower
part
of
the
bread
mixer
the
top
part
being
removed
after
the
mixing
and
sifting
have
been
accomplished
any
of
the
methods
described
may
be
used
with
the
bread
mixer
without
change
in
the
process
and
no
kneading
need
be
done
by
hand
except
a
sufficient
amount
to
shape
the
loaves
after
the
last
rising
and
before
they
are
placed
in
the
pans
serving
bread
bread
is
one
of
the
foods
that
every
one
takes
so
much
as
a
matter
of
course
that
little
thought
is
given
to
its
serving
of
course
it
does
not
offer
so
much
opportunity
for
variety
in
serving
as
do
some
foods
yet
like
all
other
foods
it
appeals
more
to
the
appetites
of
those
who
are
to
eat
it
if
it
is
served
in
an
attractive
manner
a
few
ideas
as
to
the
ways
in
which
it
may
be
served
will
therefore
not
be
amiss
as
fresh
bread
is
not
easily
digested
it
should
not
usually
be
served
until
it
is
at
least
hours
old
before
it
is
placed
on
the
table
it
should
be
cut
in
slices
the
thickness
of
which
will
depend
on
the
preference
of
the
persons
who
are
to
eat
it
if
the
loaf
is
large
in
size
the
pieces
should
be
cut
in
two
lengthwise
of
the
slice
but
in
the
case
of
a
small
loaf
the
slices
need
not
be
cut
various
receptacles
for
placing
bread
and
rolls
on
the
table
such
as
a
bread
boat
a
bread
plate
and
a
bread
basket
are
also
used
to
add
variety
in
serving
whichever
of
these
is
selected
it
may
be
improved
in
appearance
by
the
addition
of
a
white
linen
doily
for
rolls
a
cover
is
both
convenient
and
attractive
sometimes
especially
when
a
large
number
of
persons
are
to
be
served
a
roll
is
placed
between
the
folds
of
each
person
napkin
before
they
are
seated
at
the
table
occasionally
bread
becomes
stale
before
it
is
needed
on
the
table
such
bread
however
should
not
be
discarded
especially
if
the
loaves
are
uncut
uncut
loaves
of
this
kind
may
be
freshened
by
dipping
them
quickly
into
boiling
water
and
then
placing
them
in
a
very
hot
oven
until
their
surface
becomes
dry
if
desired
slices
of
bread
that
have
become
stale
may
be
steamed
in
order
to
freshen
them
but
unless
great
care
is
taken
in
steaming
them
the
bread
is
liable
to
become
too
moist
and
soggy
recipes
bread
recipes
in
order
that
the
beginner
may
bring
into
use
the
principles
and
directions
that
have
been
set
forth
and
at
the
same
time
become
familiar
with
the
quantities
of
ingredients
that
must
be
used
there
are
here
given
a
number
of
recipes
for
the
making
of
bread
these
recipes
include
not
only
white
is
bread
made
from
white
flour
but
graham
rye
and
corn
bread
as
well
as
bread
in
which
fruit
and
nuts
are
incorporated
before
these
recipes
are
taken
up
though
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
look
further
into
the
various
ingredients
used
in
the
making
of
bread
the
fat
used
in
bread
making
may
vary
in
both
quantity
and
kind
for
instance
if
less
than
tablespoonfuls
is
called
for
in
a
recipe
this
amount
may
be
decreased
but
it
is
not
well
to
increase
the
amount
to
any
extent
likewise
the
fat
may
be
of
any
kind
that
will
not
impart
a
disagreeable
flavour
to
the
finished
product
it
may
be
chicken
fat
clarified
beef
fat
lard
butter
cooking
oil
or
any
mixture
of
clear
fresh
fats
that
may
be
in
supply
the
sweetening
for
bread
is
as
a
rule
granulated
sugar
although
sirup
molasses
brown
sugar
or
white
sugar
of
any
kind
may
be
employed
sweetening
is
used
merely
to
give
a
slightly
sweet
flavour
to
the
bread
and
the
kind
that
is
used
is
of
slight
importance
the
liquid
as
has
been
stated
may
be
water
or
milk
or
any
proportion
of
both
the
milk
that
is
used
may
be
either
whole
or
skim
in
addition
to
these
two
liquids
the
whey
from
cottage
cheese
or
the
water
in
which
rice
macaroni
or
potatoes
have
been
cooked
should
not
be
overlooked
potato
water
in
which
a
small
quantity
of
potato
may
be
mashed
serves
as
a
yeast
aid
as
has
been
pointed
out
therefore
whenever
in
a
bread
recipe
liquid
is
called
for
and
the
kind
to
be
used
is
not
stated
specifically
use
may
be
made
of
any
of
the
liquids
that
have
been
mentioned
the
quantity
of
flour
required
for
a
bread
recipe
will
depend
entirely
on
the
kind
of
flour
that
is
to
be
used
bread
flour
having
a
much
greater
absorbing
power
for
liquid
than
has
pastry
or
blend
flour
when
in
the
process
of
mixing
the
bread
the
sponge
is
stiffened
by
adding
the
remaining
flour
to
it
the
last
cupful
or
two
should
be
added
cautiously
in
order
not
to
make
the
mixture
too
stiff
in
some
instances
more
flour
than
the
recipe
calls
for
may
be
required
to
make
the
dough
of
the
right
consistency
the
amount
can
be
determined
only
by
a
knowledge
of
what
this
consistency
should
be
and
this
will
be
easily
acquired
with
practice
in
bread
making
the
beginner
will
find
it
a
good
plan
to
begin
making
bread
entirely
of
white
flour
for
the
reason
that
it
is
easier
to
determine
the
consistency
of
the
dough
mixture
at
various
stages
as
well
as
during
the
kneading
if
there
is
no
coarse
material
such
as
bran
corn
meal
nuts
fruits
in
the
dough
later
when
a
definite
knowledge
along
this
line
has
been
acquired
one
after
the
other
of
the
bread
recipes
should
be
tried
they
are
no
more
difficult
to
carry
out
than
the
recipes
for
white
bread
indeed
the
woman
who
has
had
experience
in
bread
making
will
find
that
she
will
be
equally
successful
with
all
of
them
white
bread
made
from
white
flour
which
is
commonly
referred
to
as
is
used
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
any
other
kind
for
it
is
the
variety
that
most
persons
prefer
and
of
which
they
do
not
tire
quickly
however
white
bread
should
not
be
used
to
the
exclusion
of
other
breads
because
they
are
of
considerable
importance
economically
this
kind
of
bread
may
be
made
by
both
the
quick
and
the
long
processes

the
exception
of
the
quantity
of

it

both

a
point

toast
as
every
one
knows
toast
is
sliced
bread
browned
by
means
of
heat
to
make
toast
is
not
a
difficult
process
but
a
certain
amount
of
care
must
be
exercised
if
good
results
are
desired
the
slices
used
for
toast
may
be
cut
thick
or
thin
depending
on
whether
the
persons
for
whom
the
toast
is
made
prefer
a
soft
or
a
dry
toast
and
whether
the
digestibility
of
the
toast
is
to
be
taken
into
consideration
if
thick
slices
are
used
and
they
are
toasted
the
usual
length
of
time
necessary
to
make
the
surfaces
brown
the
centre
of
the
slices
will
remain
soft
toast
made
of
thin
slices
and
toasted
over
a
slow
fire
becomes
dry
and
crisp
during
the
process
of
browning
and
is
more
digestible
than
that
which
is
moist
such
toast
will
not
lose
its
crispness
unless
the
pieces
are
piled
in
a
heap
while
they
are
hot
and
are
allowed
to
soften
from
the
moisture
that
collects
while
toast
is
usually
served
in
the
form
of
slices
just
as
they
are
cut
from
the
loaf
the
pieces
may
be
cut
into
shapes
of
various
kinds
in
fact
toast
becomes
more
attractive
if
it
is
cut
in
unusual
shapes
the
crust
of
toast
may
be
trimmed
off
or
left
on
as
desired
if
the
best
results
are
desired
in
the
making
of
toast
considerable
attention
must
be
given
to
the
heat
that
is
to
produce
the
toast
whatever
kind
is
employed
it
should
be
steady
and
without
flame
before
a
coal
or
a
coke
fire
is
used
for
this
purpose
it
should
be
allowed
to
burn
down
until
the
flame
is
gone
and
the
coals
are
hot
enough
to
reflect
the
heat
for
toasting
if
a
gas
toaster
is
used
the
gas
should
be
turned
sufficiently
low
for
the
bread
to
brown
slowly
very
good
results
are
obtained
from
the
use
of
an
electric
toaster
also
this
device
has
become
a
rather
common
household
article
where
electricity
is
used
in
the
home
and
by
means
of
it
the
toast
can
be
made
on
the
table
and
served
while
it
is
fresh
and
hot
in
whatever
way
toast
is
made
it
will
lose
much
of
its
attractiveness
unless
it
is
served
while
it
is
fresh
and
before
it
loses
its
heat
if
toast
becomes
burned
either
from
a
flame
that
is
too
hot
or
from
inattention
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
is
preparing
it
it
may
be
made
fit
for
use
by
scraping
it
lightly
with
a
knife
or
by
rubbing
it
across
a
grater
so
as
to
remove
the
burned
portion
milk
milk
and
toast
make
a
combination
that
is
liked
by
many
persons
and
when
these
two
foods
are
combined
the
result
is
known
as
milk
toast
to
make
milk
toast
simply
pour
over
the
toast
rich
milk
that
has
been
heated
and
seasoned
with
salt
a
little
sugar
and
a
little
butter
thin
white
sauce
may
also
be
used
for
this
purpose
if
desired
french
possibly
no
dish
in
which
toast
is
used
is
better
known
than
the
french
toast
both
milk
and
egg
are
used
in
making
this
dish
and
these
of
course
add
to
the
food
value
of
the

thus
dipped
in

until
the
under
side
is
brown
then
turn
it
and
brown
the
other
side
serve
hot
with
sirup
or
jelly
bread
bread
that
has
become
stale
need
not
be
wasted
for
there
are
many
uses
to
which
it
may
be
put
as
such
bread
has
lost
much
of
its
moisture
it
is
desirable
for
toast
for
it
browns
more
quickly
and
makes
crisper
toast
than
fresh
bread
thick
slices
of
it
may
also
be
cut
into
cubes
or
long
narrow
strips
and
then
toasted
on
all
sides
to
be
served
with
soup
instead
of
crackers
still
another
use
that
can
be
made
of
stale
bread
is
to
toast
it
and
then
cut
it
into
triangular
pieces
to
be
served
with
creamed
dishes
or
used
as
a
garnish
for
meats
eggs
and
various
entrées
toast
may
also
be
cut
in
this
way
and
used
for
these
purposes
the
ends
of
loaves
crusts
trimmed
from
bread
used
for
sandwiches
or
stale
bread
or
rolls
that
can
not
be
used
for
the
purposes
that
have
been
mentioned
can
also
be
utilised
so
none
of
them
need
be
thrown
away
if
such
pieces
are
saved
and
allowed
to
dry
thoroughly
in
the
warming
oven
or
in
an
oven
that
is
not
very
hot
they
may
be
broken
into
crumbs
by
putting
them
through
a
food
chopper
or
rolling
them
with
a
rolling
pin
after
the
crumbs
are
obtained
they
should
be
put
through
a
coarse
sieve
in
order
to
separate
the
coarse
ones
from
the
fine
ones
such
crumbs
both
coarse
and
fine
may
be
kept
for
some
time
if
they
are
put
into
jars
or
cans
it
is
a
very
good
plan
to
keep
a
supply
of
bread
crumbs
on
hand
for
there
are
numerous
dishes
that
require
the
use
of
bread
in
this
form
for
instance
bread
crumbs
are
used
for
all
kinds
of
scalloped
dishes
for
making
puddings
such
as
bread
pudding
brown
betty
etc
for
stuffing
fish
fowl
and
such
vegetables
as
tomatoes
and
peppers
for
covering
the
top
of
baked
dishes
such
as
various
egg
and
cheese
dishes
for
breading
steaks
and
chops
and
for
covering
croquettes
or
oysters
that
are
to
be
fried
they
may
also
be
added
to
muffins
griddle
cakes
and
even
dough
with
so
many
uses
to
which
bread
crumbs
can
be
put
no
housewife
need
be
at
a

know
how
to

because
of
the
variety
these
hot
breads
afford
they
help
considerably
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
meals
in
fact
the
housewife
has
come
to
depend
so
much
on
breads
of
this
kind
that
their
use
has
become
almost
universal
as
is
well
known
however
certain
kinds
are
typical
of
certain
localities
for
instance
beaten
biscuit
and
hoe
cake
are
characteristic
of
the
southern
states
of
the
united
states
while
boston
brown
bread
is
used
most
extensively
in
the
new
england
states
and
throughout
the
east
the
popular
opinion
of
most
persons
is
that
hot
breads
are
injurious
it
is
perhaps
true
that
they
may
be
injurious
to
individuals
afflicted
with
some
digestive
disturbance
but
at
any
rate
the
harmful
effect
may
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
by
the
correct
preparation
and
baking
of
these
foods
principal
requirements
for
hot
breads
hot
breads
are
quickly
and
easily
made
but
in
this
part
of
cookery
as
in
every
other
phase
of
it
certain
principles
must
be
understood
and
applied
if
the
most
satisfactory
results
are
desired
these
principles
pertain
chiefly
to
the
ingredients
used
the
way
in
which
they
are
measured
and
handled
the
proportions
in
which
they
are
combined
the
necessary
utensils
and
the
proper
baking
of
the
mixtures
that
are
formed
in
the
first
place
the
quality
of
the
ingredients
should
be
carefully
considered
because
on
this
depends
the
quality
of
the
finished
product
no
one
who
prepares
foods
can
expect
good
food
to
result
from
the
use
of
inferior
materials
next
the
proportion
of
the
ingredients
demands
attention
for
much
importance
is
attached
to
this
point
for
instance
in
making
a
certain
kind
of
hot
bread
the
quantity
of
flour
to
be
used
is
regulated
by
the
quantity
of
bread
that
is
desired
and
the
quantity
of
flour
governs
in
turn
the
quantities
of
liquid
leavening
and
other
ingredients
that
are
to
be
put
into
the
mixture
when
the
proportions
of
ingredients
required
for
a
hot
bread
are
known
it
is
necessary
that
the
ingredients
be
measured
very
accurately
leavening
material
for
example
will
serve
to
make
clear
the
need
for
accuracy
in
measuring
a
definite
quantity
of
leavening
will
do
only
a
definite
amount
of
work
therefore
if
too
little
or
too
much
is
used
unsatisfactory
results
may
be
expected
and
as
with
this
ingredient
so
it
is
with
all
the
materials
used
for
hot
breads
the
handling
of
the
ingredients
and
the
mixture
has
also
much
influence
on
the
success
with
which
hot
breads
are
produced
a
heavy
touch
and
excessive
handling
both
of
which
are
usually
characteristic
of
the
beginner
are
more
likely
to
result
in
a
tough
product
than
is
the
light
careful
handling
of
the
expert
however
as
skill
in
this
matter
comes
with
practice
no
discouragement
need
result
if
successful
results
are
not
forthcoming
at
the
very
start
in
this
work
a
good
rule
to
follow
in
this
particular
and
one
that
has
few
exceptions
is
to
handle
and
stir
the
ingredients
only
enough
to
blend
them
properly
in
addition
to
the
matters
just
mentioned
the
utensils
in
which
to
combine
the
materials
and
bake
the
batters
or
doughs
are
of
importance
while
none
of
these
is
complicated
each
must
be
of
the
right
kind
if
the
best
results
are
expected
the
final
point
to
which
attention
must
be
given
is
the
baking
of
this
food
proper
baking
requires
on
the
part
of
the
housewife
familiarity
with
the
oven
that
is
to
be
used
accuracy
in
judging
temperature
and
a
knowledge
of
the
principles
underlying
the
process
of
baking
leavening
agents
classes
of
leavening
agents
as
has
been
pointed
out
the
ingredients
that
are
actually
required
in
the
making
of
hot
breads
are
flour
liquid
salt
and
leavening
and
to
give
variety
to
breads
of
this
kind
numerous
other
materials
including
sugar
shortening
eggs
fruit
nuts
are
often
added
with
the
exception
of
leavening
agents
none
of
these
ingredients
requires
special
attention
at
present
however
the
instruction
that
is
given
in
regarding
flour
should
be
kept
in
mind
as
should
also
the
fact
that
all
the
materials
for
hot
breads
should
be
of
the
best
quality
that
can
be
obtained
as
is
known
by
this
time
leavening
agents
are
the
materials
used
to
leaven
or
make
light
any
kind
of
flour
mixture
these
agents
are
of
three
classes
namely
and
the
organic
agent
is
the
oldest
recognized
leavening
material
it
being
the
one
that
is
used
in
the
making
of
yeast
breads
but
as
a
complete
discussion
of
this
class
of
leavening
agents
is
given
in
and
as
it
is
not
employed
in
the
making
of
hot
breads
no
consideration
need
be
given
to
it
here
physical
leavening
is
accomplished
by
the
incorporation
of
air
into
a
mixture
or
by
the
expansion
of
the
water
into
steam
and
chemical
leavening
agents
are
the
most
modern
and
accurate
of
all
the
agents
that
have
been
devised
for
the
quick
rising
of
flour
mixtures
physical
leavening
physical
leavening
consists
in
aerating
or
incorporating
gas
or
air
into
a
mixture
that
is
to
be
baked
and
it
is
based
on
the
principle
that
air
or
gas
expands
or
increases
in
volume
when
heated
it
is
definitely
known
that
when
air
is
incorporated
into
dough
and
then
heated
the
air
increases
of
its
own
volume
for
each
degree
that
the
temperature
is
increased
for
instance
if
the
temperature
of
an
aerated
mixture
is
degrees
fahrenheit
when
it
is
put
into
the
oven
the
air
or
gas
will
have
doubled
in
volume
by
the
time
it
has
reached
degrees
fahrenheit
thus
the
success
of
aerated
bread
depends
to
some
extent
on
the
temperature
of
the
mixture
when
it
goes
into
the
oven
the
colder
it
is
at
that
time
the
greater
is
the
number
of
degrees
it
will
have
to
rise
before
it
is
sufficiently
baked
and
the
more
opportunity
will
the
gas
have
to
expand
the
air
or
gas
required
for
physical
leavening
is
incorporated
into
a
mixture
by
beating
or
folding
the
batter
or
dough
itself
or
by
folding
beaten
egg
whites
into
it
if
the
mixture
is
thin
enough
the
beating
may
be
done
with
a
spoon
or
an
egg
beater
but
if
it
is
thick
enough
to
be
handled
on
a
board
air
may
be
incorporated
into
it
by
rolling
and
folding
it
repeatedly
if
eggs
are
to
be
used
for
aerating
the
batter
or
dough
the
entire
egg
may
be
beaten
and
then
added
but
as
more
air
can
be
incorporated
into
the
egg
whites
the
yolks
and
whites
are
usually
beaten
separately
to
make
the
white
of
eggs
most
satisfactory
for
this
purpose
it
should
be
beaten
stiff

certain
precautions
must
be
taken
such
mixtures
should
be
baked
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
mixing
is
done
so
that
the
gas
or
air
will
not
pass
out
before
the
dough
is
baked
likewise
they
should
be
handled
as
lightly
and
quickly
as
possible
for
a
heavy
touch
and
too
much
handling
are
often
the
cause
of
imperfect
results
for
baking
aerated
mixtures
heavy
irons
are
better
than
tin
muffin
pans
also
the
pans
that
are
used
should
be
heated
before
the
mixture
is
put
into
them
so
that
the
batter
or
dough
will
begin
to
expand
immediately

chemical
leavening
chemical
leavening
is
brought
about
by
the
action
of
gas
produced
by
an
acid
and
an
alkali
all
chemical
leavening
agents
are
similar
in
their
action
and
they
are
composed
of
an
acid
and
an
alkali
when
an
acid
and
an
alkali
are
brought
together
in
the
presence
of
moisture
and
heat
the
result
is
the
rapid
production
of
carbon
dioxide
a
gas
that
expands
on
being
heated
just
as
all
other
gases
do
in
expanding
the
gas
pushes
up
the
batters
or
doughs
and
these
when
baked
set
or
harden
into
porous
shapes
in
addition
to
forming
the
gas
the
acid
and
the
alkali
produce
a
salt
that
remains
in
the
bread
and
it
is
this
salt
that
is
responsible
for
the
harmful
effect
usually
attributed
to
chemical
leavening
agents
the
first
chemical
leavening
agents
were
devised
by
housewives
themselves
they
consisted
of
a
combination
of
saleratus
an
alkali
made
from
wood
ashes
and
sour
milk
or
molasses
the
results
obtained
were
more
or
less
satisfactory
but
never
entirely
accurate
or
certain
later
on
chemists
by
employing
the
same
idea
combined
an
alkali
with
an
acid
in
powder
form
and
produced
an
accurate
and
satisfactory
leavening
agent
in
the
form
of
baking
powder
the
discovery
of
baking
powder
however
has
not
displaced
the
use
of
other
combinations
that
form
chemical
leavening
agents
for
soda
is
still
combined
with
sour
milk
molasses
and
cream
of
tartar
in
the
making
of
various
hot
breads
therefore
so
that
a
proper
understanding
of
the
various
chemical
leavening
agents
may
be
obtained
a
discussion
of
each
is
here
given
soda
and
sour
when
soda
is
used
with
sour
milk
for
leavening
purposes
the
lactic
acid
in
the
milk
is
so
acted
upon
by
the
soda
as
to
produce
gas
however
these
two
ingredients
soda
and
sour
milk
do
not
make
an
absolutely
accurate
leavening
agent
because
the
quantity
of
acid
in
the
sour
milk
varies
according
to
the
fermentation
that
has
taken
place
for
example
sour
milk
hours
old
contains
more
acid
than
sour
milk
that
is
kept
under
the
same
conditions
but
is
only
hours
old
the
proportion
of
these
ingredients
that
is
usually
effective
in
batters
and
doughs
for
hot
breads
is
level
teaspoonful
of
soda
to
pint
of
sour
so
as
to
derive
the
best
results
in
using
these
chemical
leavening
agents
it
will
be
well
to
observe
that
if
they
are
mixed
together
in
a
cup
the
milk
will
bubble
and
may
provided
the
quantity
is
sufficient
run
over
these
bubbles
are
caused
by
the
gas
that
is
formed
when
the
acid
and
soda
meet
and
when
they
break
gas
escapes
with
the
result
that
some
of
it
is
lost
formerly
it
was
the
custom
to
mix
these
leavening
substances
in
this
way
and
then
to
add
them
to
the
other
ingredients
now
however
in
order
that
all
gas
produced
may
be
kept
in
the
dough
mixture
the
soda
is
sifted
in
with
the
dry
ingredients
and
the
sour
milk
is
added
with
the
liquid
ingredients
a
point
well
worth
remembering
is
that
sour
milk
and
soda
may
be
substituted
for
sweet
milk
and
baking
powder
in
a
recipe
that
calls
for
these
ingredients
by
using
teaspoonful
of
soda
to
each
pint
of
sour
this
information
should
prove
valuable
to
the
housewife
especially
if
she
has
accumulated
a
supply
of
sour
milk
that
should
not
be
wasted
occasionally
it
will
be
found
that
baking
powder
and
soda
are
required
in
the
same
recipe
but
this
occurs
only
when
an
insufficient
amount
of
soda
to
produce
the
desired
result
is
specified
soda
and
although
molasses
which
is
a
product
of
sugar
cane
is
sweet
it
contains
an
acid
that
is
formed
by
the
fermentation
that
continually
occurs
in
it
an
evidence
of
which
is
the
tiny
bubbles
that
may
be
seen
in
molasses
especially
when
it
is
kept
in
a
warm
place
because
of
the
presence
of
this
acid
molasses
may
be
used
with
soda
to
form
a
chemical
leavening
agent
and
when
they
are
combined
in
hot
breads
or
cake
the
chemical
action
of
the
two
produces
carbon
dioxide
however
accurate
results
can
not
always
be
obtained
when
these
ingredients
are
used
for
the
degree
of
acidity
in
molasses
is
as
uncertain
as
it
is
in
sour
milk
molasses
that
is
old
or
has
been
kept
in
a
warm
place
will
contain
more
acid
than
molasses
that
has
been
manufactured
only
a
short
time
or
that
has
been
kept
cool
to
retard
fermentation
the
proportion
of
soda
to
molasses
that
can
usually
be
relied
on
for
hot
breads
and
cakes
is
teaspoonful
of
soda
to
cupful
of
or
just
twice
the
quantity
of
soda
that
is
generally
used
with
sour
milk
to
produce
the
best
results
the
molasses
should
be
mixed
with
the
liquid
ingredients
and
the
soda
sifted
in
with
the
dry
ones
as
molasses
burns
very
quickly
in
a
hot
oven
all
breads
or
cakes
containing
it
as
an
ingredient
should
be
baked
in
an
oven
of
moderate
temperature
soda
and
cream
of
some
housewives
are
inclined
to
use
soda
and
cream
of
tartar
for
leavening
purposes
but
there
is
really
no
advantage
in
doing
this
when
baking
powder
can
be
obtained
for
some
baking
powders
are
a
combination
of
these
two
ingredients
and
produce
the
same
result
in
fact
the
housewife
can
not
measure
soda
and
cream
of
tartar
so
accurately
as
the
chemist
can
combine
them
in
the
manufacture
of
baking
powder
nevertheless
if
their
use
is
preferred
they
should
be
measured
in
the
proportion
of
as
much
cream
of
tartar
as
as
in
the
case
of
soda
alone
these
leavening
agents
should
be
sifted
with
the
dry
ingredients
a
small
quantity
of
cream
of
tartar
is
used
without
soda
in
such
mixtures
as
cake
in
which
egg
white
alone
is
used
to
make
the
mixture
light
the
addition
of
the
cream
of
tartar
has
the
effect
of
so
solidifying
the
egg
white
that
it
holds
up
until
the
heat
of
the
oven
hardens
it
permanently
baking
without
doubt
baking
powder
is
the
most
satisfactory
of
the
chemical
leavening
agents
it
comes
in
three
varieties
but
they
are
all
similar
in
composition
for
each
contains
an
alkali
in
the
form
of
soda
and
an
acid
of
some
kind
as
well
as
a
filler
of
starch
which
serves
to
prevent
the
acid
and
the
alkali
from
acting
upon
each
other
when
moisture
is
added
to
baking
powder
chemical
action
sets
in
but
it
is
not
very
rapid
as
is
apparent
when
a
cake
or
a
muffin
mixture
is
allowed
to
stand
before
baking
the
bubbles
of
gas
that
form
in
such
a
mixture
can
easily
be
observed
if
the
mixture
is
stirred
after
it
has
stood
for
a
short
time
when
both
moisture
and
heat
are
applied
to
baking
powder
however
the
chemical
action
that
takes
place
is
more
rapid
and
this
accounts
for
its
usefulness
in
baking
hot
breads
and
cake
the
price
of
the
different
kinds
of
baking
powder
which
usually
varies
from
cents
to
cents
a
pound
is
generally
an
indication
of
the
ingredients
that
they
contain
powders
that
sell
for
to
cents
a
pound
usually
contain
cream
of
tartar
for
the
acid
the
high
price
of
this
substance
accounting
for
the
price
of
the
powder
powders
that
may
be
purchased
for
to
cents
a
pound
generally
contain
acid
phosphate
of
lime
and
as
this
substance
is
cheaper
than
cream
of
tartar
a
mixture
containing
it
may
well
be
sold
for
less
the
cheapest
grade
of
powders
or
those
which
sell
for
to
cents
a
pound
have
for
their
acid
a
salt
of
aluminum
called
alum
still
other
powders
that
are
sometimes
made
up
to
sell
for
to
cents
a
pound
contain
a
mixture
of
phosphate
and
alum
as
baking
powders
vary
in
price
so
do
they
vary
in
their
keeping
qualities
their
effectiveness
and
their
tendency
toward
being
injurious
most
phosphate
and
alum
powders
do
not
keep
so
well
as
the
powders
and
the
longer
they
are
kept
the
less
effective
do
they
become
the
powders
that
contain
phosphate
yield
more
gas
for
each
teaspoonful
used
than
do
the
other
varieties
much
controversy
has
taken
place
with
regard
to
the
different
kinds
of
baking
powder
and
their
effects
on
the
digestive
tract
but
authorities
have
not
yet
agreed
on
this
matter
however
if
foods
made
with
the
aid
of
baking
powders
are
not
used
excessively
no
concern
need
be
felt
as
to
their
injurious
effect
the
housewife
in
her
choice
of
baking
powder
should
be
guided
by
the
price
she
can
afford
to
pay
and
the
results
she
is
able
to
get
after
she
has
become
well
informed
as
to
the
effect
of
the
different
varieties
she
may
easily
become
familiar
with
the
composition
of
baking
powder
for
a
statement
of
what
substances
each
kind
contains
is
generally
found
on
the
label
of
every
variety
this
information
is
invaluable
to
the
housewife
as
it
will
assist
her
considerably
in
making
a
selection
the
proportion
of
baking
powder
to
be
used
in
a
batter
or
a
dough
is
regulated
by
the
quantity
of
flour
employed
and
not
as
is
the
case
with
soda
and
molasses
or
sour
milk
by
the
quantity

usual
proportion
being
level
teaspoonfuls
to
cupful

this
proportion
is
decreased
or
teaspoonfuls

used
instead
of
to
each
quart
of
flour
in

making
of
large
quantities
of
some
kinds
of

in
adding
baking

of
course
will
result
in
wasting
considerable
food
material
tempering
may
be
done
by
covering
the
griddle
with
a
quantity
of
fat
placing
it
over
a
flame
or
in
a
very
hot
oven
and
then
allowing
it
to
heat
thoroughly
to
such
a
temperature
that
the
fat
will
burn
onto
the
surface
this
same
precaution
should
be
observed
with
new
waffle
irons
and
frying
pans
made
of
steel
or
iron
if
the
best
results
from
such
utensils
are
desired
waffle
a
waffle
iron
as
shown
in
figs
and
consists
of
two
corrugated
griddles
fastened
together
with
a
hinge
in
such
a
way
that
the
surfaces
nearly
touch
when
the
handles
are
brought
together
as
in

these
griddles
are
so
suspended
in
a
frame
that
they
may
be
turned
completely
over
in

to
allow
each
side
to
be
exposed

of
either
kind
it

be
heated
while
the
waffle
mixture
is
being
prepared
then
it
should
be
thoroughly
greased
on
both
sides
no
excess
fat
however
should
be
used
as
it
will
run
out
when

varieties
of
mixtures
and
general
proportions
batters
and
the
mixtures
from
which
hot
breads
are
produced
are
of
different
consistencies
and
familiarity
with
them
is
necessary
if
good
results
in
the
making
of
such
breads
are
desired
this
difference
in
the
consistencies
is
due
to
the
proportion
of
flour
and
liquid
used
a
small
proportion
of
flour
producing
a
and
a
large
proportion
a
it
will
be
well
to
note
however
that
some
kinds
of
flour
thicken
a
mixture
much
more
readily
than
do
others
experience
in
the
handling
of
flour
teaches
how
to
vary
the
other
ingredients
of
a
recipe
in
order
to
make
them
correspond
to
the
difference
in
flour
but
the
person
who
lacks
a
knowledge
of
cookery
or
has
had
very
little
experience
in
the
handling
of
foods
must
know
the
general
proportions
that
are
correct
under
most
circumstances
the
names
of
the
mixtures
that
the
ingredients
produce
are

a
thin
batter
is
one
in
which
the
general
proportion
of
liquid
and
flour
is
measure
of
to
measure
of
such
a
batter
when
poured
immediately
seeks
its
own
level
and
has
the
consistency
of

the
most
common
examples
of
thin
batters
are
popovers
and

is
known
as
a
or

required
less
liquid
being
necessary
when
these
ingredients
are
used
to
get
the
best
results
from
a
new
recipe
it
is
always
advisable
upon
reading
the
recipe
to
notice
the
proportions
that
are
given
and
then
to
try
to
judge
whether
they
bear
a
close
enough
resemblance
to
the
general
proportions
to
make
a
successful
dish
for
instance
if
a
recipe
calls
for
cupfuls
of
flour
and
cupful
of
liquid
the
cook
who
understands
what
the
general
proportions
for
such
a
batter
ought
to
be
would
know
immediately
that
the
recipe
calls
for
too
much
flour
likewise
she
would
know
that
a
recipe
for
biscuits
that
calls
for
cupfuls
of
flour
and
cupful
of
liquid
would
make
a
dough
that
would
be
too
soft
to
handle
besides
enabling
a
woman
to
judge
a
recipe
a
knowledge
of
the
correct
proportions
for
things
of
this
kind
makes
it
possible
for
her
to
combine
the
ingredients
for
a
certain
recipe
without
resorting
to
a
cook
book
or
in
other
words
to
originate
a
recipe
because
of
the
importance
of
such
an
understanding
attention
should
always
be
given
to
details
that
will
assist
in
obtaining
a
thorough
knowledge
of
this
matter
preparing
the
mixture
preliminary
preparation
of
before
the
mixing
of
the
ingredients
that
are
to
be
used
in
the
batters
and
doughs
of
hot
breads
is
begun
all
that
are
needed
for
the
recipe
selected
should
be
collected
and
properly
measured
always
sift
the
flour
that
is
to
be
used
for
this
purpose
this
is
a
rule
that
never
varies
with
regard
to
flour
to
be
used
for
any
dough
mixture
or
as
a
thickening
agent
then
to
prevent
the
flour
from
packing
too
solidly
measure
it
by
dipping
it
into
the
cup
with
a
spoon
to
obtain
the
proper
amount
heap
the
cup
and
then
level
it
with
the
edge
of
a
knife
measure
with
a
spoon
whatever
dry
leavening
agent
is
called
for
and
be
sure
that
it
does
not
contain
any
lumps
if
salt

and
spices
are
to
be
used

or
other
fat
by
packing
it
in
the
spoon
and
then
leveling
it
with
a
knife
be
particular
in
measuring
the
liquid
using
neither
more
nor
less
than
is
called
for
regarding
this
ingredient
it
should
always
be
remembered
that
when
a
cupful
is
required
a
cup
full
to
the
brim
is
meant
and
that
any
fraction
of
a
cupful
should
be
measured
with
the
same
exactness
combining
the
the
manner
in
which
a
batter
or
a
dough
is
mixed
is
very
important
for
much
of
the
success
of
the
finished
product
depends
on
the
order
in
which
the
various
steps
are
accomplished
two
general
methods
of
combining
the
ingredients
for
such
mixtures
have
been
devised
and
either
of
them
may
be
followed
because
they
produce
equally
good
results
in
one
of
these
methods
the
fat
is
worked
into
the
dry
ingredients
and
the
liquid
then
added
as
eggs
are
usually
considered
a
liquid
ingredient
they
are
beaten
and
added
to
the
rest
of
the
liquid
before
it
is
mixed
with
the
dry
ingredients
however
if
eggs
are
to
be
used
for
leavening
only
the
yolks
are
added
with
the
liquid
ingredients
the
whites
being
beaten
separately
and
folded
in
last
the
other
method
is
used
only
when
the
mixtures
are
to
contain
a
small
quantity
of
fat
in
this
method
all
the
liquid
ingredients
including
the
eggs
are
first
mixed
together
then
the
dry
ingredients
are
combined
and
sifted
into
the
liquid
the
fat
is
melted
last
and
beaten
into
the
dough
mixture
if
the
mixture
to
be
handled
is
a
stiff
one
the
fat
should
be
put
in
cold
for
adding
melted
fat
makes
the
dough
soft
and
sticky
and
therefore
difficult
to
handle
baking
the
mixture
regulating
the
when
the
ingredients
have
been
properly
combined
the
mixture
is
ready
to
be
baked
with
the
exception
of
waffles
and
griddle
cakes
the
baking
of
which
is
explained
in
connection
with
the
recipes
all
hot
breads
are
baked
in
the
oven
therefore
while
the
mixture
is
being
prepared
the
oven
should
be
properly
regulated
in
order
that
the
temperature
will
be
just
right
when
it
is
time
to
start
the
baking
particular
thought
should
be
given
to
this
matter
for
if
no
attention
is
paid
to
the
oven
until
the
mixture
is
ready
to
be
baked
it
will
be
necessary
to
allow
the
mixture
to
stand
until
the
heat
of
the
oven
can
be
regulated
or
to
put
it
into
the
oven
and
run
the
risk
of
spoiling
the
food
to
prevent
either
of
these
conditions
and
to
insure
success
the
fuel
no
matter
what
kind
is
used
should
be
lighted
before
mixing
is
begun
so
that
the
oven
may
be
heating
while
the
mixture
is
being
prepared
unless
as
is
sometimes
the
case
there
are
steps
in
the
preparation
of
the
mixture
that
consume
considerable
time
for
instance
looking
over
raisins
and
cleaning
them
or
cracking
nuts
and
picking
the
meats
out
of
the
shells
should
be
done
before
the
rest
of
the
ingredients
are
prepared
or
the
oven
is
regulated
correct
oven
quick
breads
that
are
to
be
baked
in
the
form
of
loaves
require
an
oven
temperature
of
from
to
degrees
fahrenheit
muffins
biscuits
and
the
smaller
varieties
of
these
breads
need
a
higher
temperature
to
degrees
fahrenheit
being
best
as
they
are
not
so
large
the
heat
has
less
dough
through
which
to
penetrate
and
consequently
the
baking
can
be
accomplished
more
quickly
determining
and
regulating
oven
regulating
the
oven
and
testing
its
temperature
present
very
little
difficulty
to
the
housewife
of
experience
but
they
are
not
always
easy
problems
for
the
woman
who
is
learning
to
cook
however
if
the
untrained
and
inexperienced
cook
will
observe
her
oven
closely
and
determine
the
results
of
certain
temperatures
she
will
soon
find
herself
becoming
more
successful
in
this
matter
to
assist
the
housewife
in
this
matter
as
well
as
to
help
in
the
saving
of
much
loss
in
fuel
and
in
underdone
or
overdone
food
many
stoves
are
equipped
with
an
oven
thermometer
an
indicator
or
a
thermostat
the
thermometer
is
more
likely
to
be
reliable
than
the
indicator
as
it
has
a
column
of
mercury
like
that
of
any
other
thermometer
and
is
graduated
also
a
certain
kind
may
be
secured
that
can
be
used
with
any
sort
of
oven
the
indicator
is
in
the
form
of
a
dial
with
a
hand
attached
to
a
metal
spring
this
spring
contracts
and
expands
with
the
changes
in
the
temperature
of
the
oven
and
thus
causes
the
hand
to
point
out
the
temperature
the
thermostat
is
a
device
that
automatically
regulates
the
heat
of
the
oven
on
a
stove
equipped
with
a
thermostat
it
is
simply
necessary
to
set
the
device
at
the
temperature
desired
when
this
temperature
is
reached
the
device
keeps
it
stationary
if
neither
an
indicator
nor
a
thermometer
is
available
the
heat
of
the
oven
may
be
determined
in
other
ways
some
housewives
test
the
oven
with
the
hand
and
while
such
a
test
is
more
or
less
dependent
on
experience
those
who
use
it
find
it
very
satisfactory
if
the
hand
can
be
held
in
the
oven
while
is
counted
slowly
the
temperature
is
that
of
a
moderate
oven
and
will
be
right
for
the
baking
of
loaves
an
oven
that
is
of
the
proper
temperature
for
muffins
or
rolls
will
permit
the
hand
to
be
held
in
it
while
only
is
counted
slowly
those
who
do
not
test
with
the
hand
find
that
placing
a
piece
of
white
paper
in
the
oven
is
an
accurate
way
of
determining
its
temperature
such
paper
will
turn
a
delicate
brown
in
minutes
in
a
moderate
oven
and
a
deeper
brown
in
minutes
in
a
hot
oven
proper
placing
of
the
mixture
in
the
as
is
pointed
out
in
of
part
the
top
of
the
oven
is
hotter
than
the
bottom
this
truth
and
the
fact
that
in
an
oven
as
in
any
other
space
air
expands
and
rises
on
becoming
heated
are
points
that
have
much
to
do
with
the
baking
of
quick
breads
for
these
are
mixtures
that
rise
after
being
placed
in
the
oven
so
that
they
may
rise
properly
they
should
be
placed
on
the
bottom
first
then
as
they
become
heated
they
will
have
a
tendency
to
rise
as
the
air
does
if
the
food
is
placed
near
the
top
first
the
heated
air
will
be
likely
to
press
it
down
and
retard
its
rising
as
soon
as
the
rising
is
completed
and
the
food
has
baked
sufficiently
on
the
bottom
it
should
be
moved
up
so
that
it
will
brown
on
the
top
testing
the
baked
recipes
for
baked
dishes
usually
state
the
length
of
time
required
to
bake
them
but
such
directions
can
not
always
be
depended
on
because
the
temperature
of
the
oven
varies
at
different
times
the
best
way
in
which
to
judge
whether
the
food
has
baked
the
necessary
length
of
time
is
to
apply
to
it
one
of
the
reliable
tests
that
have
been
devised
for
this
purpose
probably
the
most
satisfactory
test
is
to
insert
a
toothpick
as
deep
as
possible
into
the
center
of
the
loaf
the
center
rather
than
some
other
part
of
the
loaf
is
the
place
where
the
testing
should
be
done
because
the
heat
penetrates
a
mixture
from
the
outside
and
the
center
is
therefore
the
last
part
to
bake
if
the
toothpick
comes
out
without
particles
of
dough
adhering
the
mixture
is
sufficiently
baked
in
that
place
and
consequently
throughout
the
loaf
in
case
the
dough
sticks
to
the
toothpick
the
baking
is
not
completed
and
will
have
to
be
continued
since
this
is
a
test
that
is
frequently
used
a
supply
of
toothpicks
preferably
round
ones
should
be
kept
in
a
handy
place
near
the
stove
another
fairly
accurate
means
of
testing
baked
mixtures
that
do
not
form
a
very
hard
crust
consists
in
making
a
dent
in
the
center
with
the
finger
if
the
dent
remains
the
baking
must
be
continued
but
if
it
springs
back
into
place
the
baking
is
completed
serving
hot

hot
breads
in
contrast
with
yeast
breads
are
intended
to
be
eaten
hot
and
to
be
most
satisfactory
should
be
served
as
soon
as
possible
after
they
are
baked
they
usually
take
the
place
of
bread
in
the
meal
for
which
they
are
served
but
there
are
various
ways
of
using
them
whereby
variety
is
given
to
them
and
to
the
meal
a
favorite
combination
with
many
persons
is
hot
biscuits
or
muffins
served
with
honey
if
honey
is
not
available
jam
preserves
or
sirup
may
be
substituted
to
advantage
a
mixture
made
like
biscuits
and
baked
or
steamed
is
especially
good
when
served
with
chicken
or
meat
stew
poured
over
it
the
same
mixture
sweetened
and
made
a
trifle
richer
may
be
served
with
fruit
and
cream
for
short
cake
for
afternoon
tea
tiny
muffins
and
biscuits
about
the
size
of
a
piece
are
very
attractive
then
too
if
they
are
split
and
buttered
they
may
be
served
with
salad
for
a
light
luncheon
hot
breads
baked
in
the
form
of
a
loaf
require
some
attention
as
far
as
preparing
them
for
the
table
is
concerned
gingerbread
and
corn
cake
are
better
if
they
are
broken
rather
than
cut
while
hot
in
case
they
are
preferred
cut
a
sharp
knife
should
be
employed
and
to
obtain
slices
that
have
a
good
appearance
the
knife
should
be
heated
and
the
cutting
done
before
it
cools
usually
gingerbread
is
served
plain
but
the
addition
of
icing
improves
it
considerably
and
provides
a
simple
cake
that
can
be
used
for
dessert

a
delightful
change
from
the

afforded
by
means
of
popovers

of

some
of

books
recommend
beating
for
minutes
just
before
they
are
baked
because
the
lightness
was
formerly
supposed
to
be
due

the
air
that
is
incorporated
by
this
beating
it

possible
however
to
make

light
popovers
with
only
enough
beating
to
mix
the

thoroughly

it

now
known
that
the

due

the
expansion

have
the

heating
so
that
it
will
be
sufficiently
hot
when
the

are
ready
to
be
baked
each
time
before
the

is

grease
the

provided
it
is

kind
that
requires
greasing
by
rubbing
over
it
a
rind
of
salt
pork
or
a
small
cloth
pad
that
has
been
dipped
into
a
dish
of
grease
in
greasing
the
griddle
see
that
there
is
no
excess
of
grease
as
this
burns
and
produces
smoke
when
the
griddle
has
become
hot

for
the

it
is
put
on

be
started
pour
the
batter
on
the
griddle
from
the
tip
of
a

spoon

that

of
bubbles
turn
the
cakes
with
a
spatula
or
a
pancake
turner
and
allow
them
to
brown
on
the
other
side
by
the
time
the
cakes
are
sufficiently
browned
on
both
sides
they
should
be
cooked
through
and
ready
to
serve
if
they
brown
before
they
have
had
time

the
griddle

too
hot
and
should
be
cooled
by
moving
it
to
a
cooler
part
of
the
stove
or
by
reducing
the
heat
a
very
important
point
to
remember
in
the
baking
of
griddle
cakes
is
that
they
should
not
be
turned
twice
as
this
has
a
tendency
to
make
them
heavy
griddle
as
is
generally
known
griddle
cakes
are
thin
batters
that
are
made
light
with
a
chemical
leavening
agent
eggs
are
often
used
in
such
batters
but
it
is
possible
to
make
very
excellent
griddle
cakes
without
the
use
of
any
eggs
it
should
also
be
remembered
that
the
use
of
too
much
egg
is
more
certain
to
make
the
cakes
tough
and
less
palatable
than
if
none
is
used
the
kind
of
flour
used
for
griddle
cakes
has
much
to
do
with
the
consistency
of
the
batter
used
for
them
if
when
the
first
cakes
are
placed
upon
the
griddle
the
batter
seems
to
be
either
too
thick
or
too
thin
liquid
or
flour
may
be
added
to
dilute
or
thicken
the
batter
until
it
is
of
the
right
consistency
for
instance
if
bread
flour
is
used
more
liquid
may
be
needed
and
if
pastry
flour
is
used
more
flour
may
be
required

the

did
not

were
not
bulky

contained
a
great

they
made

called
from

came
the
name
