how
i
killed
a
bear
lost
in
the
woods
a
fight
with
a
trout
of
the
deer
a
character
study
old
phelps
camping
out

wilderness
romance
what
some
people
call
pleasure
i
how
i
killed
a
bear
so
many
conflicting
accounts
have
appeared
about
my
casual
encounter
with
an
adirondack
bear
last
summer
that
in
justice
to
the
public
to
myself
and
to
the
bear
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
plain
statement
of
the
facts
besides
it
is
so
seldom
i
have
occasion
to
kill
a
bear
that
the
celebration
of
the
exploit
may
be
excused
the
encounter
was
unpremeditated
on
both
sides
i
was
not
hunting
for
a
bear
and
i
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
a
bear
was
looking
for
me
the
fact
is
that
we
were
both
out
blackberrying
and
met
by
chance
the
usual
way
there
is
among
the
adirondack
visitors
always
a
great
deal
of
conversation
about
bears
a
general
expression
of
the
wish
to
see
one
in
the
woods
and
much
speculation
as
to
how
a
person
would
act
if
he
or
she
chanced
to
meet
one
but
bears
are
scarce
and
timid
and
appear
only
to
a
favored
few
it
was
a
warm
day
in
august
just
the
sort
of
day
when
an
adventure
of
any
kind
seemed
impossible
but
it
occurred
to
the
housekeepers
at
our
cottage
there
were
four
of
them
to
send
me
to
the
clearing
on
the
mountain
back
of
the
house
to
pick
blackberries
it
was
rather
a
series
of
small
clearings
running
up
into
the
forest
much
overgrown
with
bushes
and
briers
and
not
unromantic
cows
pastured
there
penetrating
through
the
leafy
passages
from
one
opening
to
another
and
browsing
among
the
bushes
i
was
kindly
furnished
with
a
pail
and
told
not
to
be
gone
long
not
from
any
predatory
instinct
but
to
save
appearances
i
took
a
gun
it
adds
to
the
manly
aspect
of
a
person
with
a
tin
pail
if
he
also
carries
a
gun
it
was
possible
i
might
start
up
a
partridge
though
how
i
was
to
hit
him
if
he
started
up
instead
of
standing
still
puzzled
me
many
people
use
a
shotgun
for
partridges
i
prefer
the
rifle
it
makes
a
clean
job
of
death
and
does
not
prematurely
stuff
the
bird
with
globules
of
lead
the
rifle
was
a
sharps
carrying
a
ball
cartridge
ten
to
the
pound
an
excellent
weapon
belonging
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
had
intended
for
a
good
many
years
back
to
kill
a
deer
with
it
he
could
hit
a
tree
with
it
if
the
wind
did
not
blow
and
the
atmosphere
was
just
right
and
the
tree
was
not
too
far
off
nearly
every
time
of
course
the
tree
must
have
some
size
needless
to
say
that
i
was
at
that
time
no
sportsman
years
ago
i
killed
a
robin
under
the
most
humiliating
circumstances
the
bird
was
in
a
low
i
loaded
a
big
shotgun
pretty
full
crept
up
under
the
tree
rested
the
gun
on
the
fence
with
the
muzzle
more
than
ten
feet
from
the
bird
shut
both
eyes
and
pulled
the
trigger
when
i
got
up
to
see
what
had
happened
the
robin
was
scattered
about
under
the
tree
in
more
than
a
thousand
pieces
no
one
of
which
was
big
enough
to
enable
a
naturalist
to
decide
from
it
to
what
species
it
belonged
this
disgusted
me
with
the
life
of
a
sportsman
i
mention
the
incident
to
show
that
although
i
went
blackberrying
armed
there
was
not
much
inequality
between
me
and
the
bear
in
this
bears
had
been
seen
the
summer
before
our
colored
cook
accompanied
by
a
little
girl
of
the
vicinage
was
picking
berries
there
one
day
when
a
bear
came
out
of
the
woods
and
walked
towards
them
the
girl
took
to
her
heels
and
escaped
aunt
chloe
was
paralyzed
with
terror
instead
of
attempting
to
run
she
sat
down
on
the
ground
where
she
was
standing
and
began
to
weep
and
scream
giving
herself
up
for
lost
the
bear
was
bewildered
by
this
conduct
he
approached
and
looked
at
her
he
walked
around
and
surveyed
her
probably
he
had
never
seen
a
colored
person
before
and
did
not
know
whether
she
would
agree
with
him
at
any
rate
after
watching
her
a
few
moments
he
turned
about
and
went
into
the
forest
this
is
an
authentic
instance
of
the
delicate
consideration
of
a
bear
and
is
much
more
remarkable
than
the
forbearance
towards
the
african
slave
of
the
lion
because
the
bear
had
no
thorn
in
his
foot
when
i
had
climbed
the
hill
i
set
up
my
rifle
against
a
tree
and
began
picking
berries
lured
on
from
bush
to
bush
by
the
black
gleam
of
fruit
that
always
promises
more
in
the
distance
than
it
realizes
when
you
reach
it
penetrating
farther
and
farther
through
flecked
with
sunlight
into
clearing
after
clearing
i
could
hear
on
all
sides
the
tinkle
of
bells
the
cracking
of
sticks
and
the
stamping
of
cattle
that
were
taking
refuge
in
the
thicket
from
the
flies
occasionally
as
i
broke
through
a
covert
i
encountered
a
meek
cow
who
stared
at
me
stupidly
for
a
second
and
then
shambled
off
into
the
brush
i
became
accustomed
to
this
dumb
society
and
picked
on
in
silence
attributing
all
the
wood
noises
to
the
cattle
thinking
nothing
of
any
real
bear
in
point
of
fact
however
i
was
thinking
all
the
time
of
a
nice
romantic
bear
and
as
i
picked
was
composing
a
story
about
a
generous
who
had
lost
her
cub
and
who
seized
a
small
girl
in
this
very
wood
carried
her
tenderly
off
to
a
cave
and
brought
her
up
on
bear
milk
and
honey
when
the
girl
got
big
enough
to
run
away
moved
by
her
inherited
instincts
she
escaped
and
came
into
the
valley
to
her
father
house
this
part
of
the
story
was
to
be
worked
out
so
that
the
child
would
know
her
father
by
some
family
resemblance
and
have
some
language
in
which
to
address
him
and
told
him
where
the
bear
lived
the
father
took
his
gun
and
guided
by
the
unfeeling
daughter
went
into
the
woods
and
shot
the
bear
who
never
made
any
resistance
and
only
when
dying
turned
reproachful
eyes
upon
her
murderer
the
moral
of
the
tale
was
to
be
kindness
to
animals
i
was
in
the
midst
of
this
tale
when
i
happened
to
look
some
rods
away
to
the
other
edge
of
the
clearing
and
there
was
a
bear
he
was
standing
on
his
hind
legs
and
doing
just
what
i
was
doing
picking
blackberries
with
one
paw
he
bent
down
the
bush
while
with
the
other
he
clawed
the
berries
into
his
mouth
green
ones
and
all
to
say
that
i
was
astonished
is
inside
the
mark
i
suddenly
discovered
that
i
want
to
see
a
bear
after
all
at
about
the
same
moment
the
bear
saw
me
stopped
eating
berries
and
regarded
me
with
a
glad
surprise
it
is
all
very
well
to
imagine
what
you
would
do
under
such
circumstances
probably
you
would
do
it
i
did
the
bear
dropped
down
on
his
forefeet
and
came
slowly
towards
me
climbing
a
tree
was
of
no
use
with
so
good
a
climber
in
the
rear
if
i
started
to
run
i
had
no
doubt
the
bear
would
give
chase
and
although
a
bear
can
not
run
down
hill
as
fast
as
he
can
run
up
hill
yet
i
felt
that
he
could
get
over
this
rough
ground
faster
than
i
could
the
bear
was
approaching
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
how
i
could
divert
his
mind
until
i
could
fall
back
upon
my
military
base
my
pail
was
nearly
full
of
excellent
berries
much
better
than
the
bear
could
pick
himself
i
put
the
pail
on
the
ground
and
slowly
backed
away
from
it
keeping
my
eye
as
do
on
the
bear
the
ruse
succeeded
the
bear
came
up
to
the
berries
and
stopped
not
accustomed
to
eat
out
of
a
pail
he
tipped
it
over
and
nosed
about
in
the
fruit
if
there
is
such
a
word
it
down
mixed
with
leaves
and
dirt
like
a
pig
the
bear
is
a
worse
feeder
than
the
pig
whenever
he
disturbs
a
camp
in
the
spring
he
always
upsets
the
buckets
of
syrup
and
tramples
round
in
the
sticky
sweets
wasting
more
than
he
eats
the
bear
manners
are
thoroughly
disagreeable
as
soon
as
my
enemy
head
was
down
i
started
and
ran
somewhat
out
of
breath
and
shaky
i
reached
my
faithful
rifle
it
was
not
a
moment
too
soon
i
heard
the
bear
crashing
through
the
brush
after
me
enraged
at
my
duplicity
he
was
now
coming
on
with
blood
in
his
eye
i
felt
that
the
time
of
one
of
us
was
probably
short
the
rapidity
of
thought
at
such
moments
of
peril
is
well
known
i
thought
an
octavo
volume
had
it
illustrated
and
published
sold
fifty
thousand
copies
and
went
to
europe
on
the
proceeds
while
that
bear
was
loping
across
the
clearing
as
i
was
cocking
the
gun
i
made
a
hasty
and
unsatisfactory
review
of
my
whole
life
i
noted
that
even
in
such
a
compulsory
review
it
is
almost
impossible
to
think
of
any
good
thing
you
have
done
the
sins
come
out
uncommonly
strong
i
recollected
a
newspaper
subscription
i
had
delayed
paying
years
and
years
ago
until
both
editor
and
newspaper
were
dead
and
which
now
never
could
be
paid
to
all
eternity
the
bear
was
coming
on
i
tried
to
remember
what
i
had
read
about
encounters
with
bears
i
could
recall
an
instance
in
which
a
man
had
run
away
from
a
bear
in
the
woods
and
escaped
although
i
recalled
plenty
where
the
bear
had
run
from
the
man
and
got
off
i
tried
to
think
what
is
the
best
way
to
kill
a
bear
with
a
gun
when
you
are
not
near
enough
to
club
him
with
the
stock
my
first
thought
was
to
fire
at
his
head
to
plant
the
ball
between
his
eyes
but
this
is
a
dangerous
experiment
the
bear
brain
is
very
small
and
unless
you
hit
that
the
bear
does
not
mind
a
bullet
in
his
head
that
is
not
at
the
time
i
remembered
that
the
instant
death
of
the
bear
would
follow
a
bullet
planted
just
back
of
his
and
sent
into
his
heart
this
spot
is
also
difficult
to
reach
unless
the
bear
stands
off
side
towards
you
like
a
target
i
finally
determined
to
fire
at
him
generally
the
bear
was
coming
on
the
contest
seemed
to
me
very
different
from
anything
at
creedmoor
i
had
carefully
read
the
reports
of
the
shooting
there
but
it
was
not
easy
to
apply
the
experience
i
had
thus
acquired
i
hesitated
whether
i
had
better
fire
lying
on
my
stomach
or
lying
on
my
back
and
resting
the
gun
on
my
toes
but
in
neither
position
i
reflected
could
i
see
the
bear
until
he
was
upon
me
the
range
was
too
short
and
the
bear
would
wait
for
me
to
examine
the
thermometer
and
note
the
direction
of
the
wind
trial
of
the
creedmoor
method
therefore
had
to
be
abandoned
and
i
bitterly
regretted
that
i
had
not
read
more
accounts
of
offhand
shooting
for
the
bear
was
coming
on
i
tried
to
fix
my
last
thoughts
upon
my
family
as
my
family
is
small
this
was
not
difficult
dread
of
displeasing
my
wife
or
hurting
her
feelings
was
uppermost
in
my
mind
what
would
be
her
anxiety
as
hour
after
hour
passed
on
and
i
did
not
return
what
would
the
rest
of
the
household
think
as
the
afternoon
passed
and
no
blackberries
came
what
would
be
my
wife
mortification
when
the
news
was
brought
that
her
husband
had
been
eaten
by
a
bear
i
can
not
imagine
anything
more
ignominious
than
to
have
a
husband
eaten
by
a
bear
and
this
was
not
my
only
anxiety
the
mind
at
such
times
is
not
under
control
with
the
gravest
fears
the
most
whimsical
ideas
will
occur
i
looked
beyond
the
mourning
friends
and
thought
what
kind
of
an
epitaph
they
would
be
compelled
to
put
upon
the
stone
something
like
this
here
lie
the
remains
of
eaten
by
a
bear
it
is
a
very
unheroic
and
even
disagreeable
epitaph
that
by
a
is
intolerable
it
is
grotesque
and
then
i
thought
what
an
inadequate
language
the
english
is
for
compact
expression
it
would
not
answer
to
put
upon
the
stone
simply
for
that
is
indefinite
and
requires
explanation
it
might
mean
eaten
by
a
cannibal
this
difficulty
could
not
occur
in
the
german
where
essen
signifies
the
act
of
feeding
by
a
man
and
fressen
by
a
beast
how
simple
the
thing
would
be
in
german
hier
liegt
hochwohlgeboren
herr
gefressen
that
explains
itself
the
one
was
eaten
by
a
beast
and
presumably
by
a
bear
an
animal
that
has
a
bad
reputation
since
the
days
of
elisha
the
bear
was
coming
on
he
had
in
fact
come
on
i
judged
that
he
could
see
the
whites
of
my
eyes
all
my
subsequent
reflections
were
confused
i
raised
the
gun
covered
the
bear
breast
with
the
sight
and
let
drive
then
i
turned
and
ran
like
a
deer
i
did
not
hear
the
bear
pursuing
i
looked
back
the
bear
had
stopped
he
was
lying
down
i
then
remembered
that
the
best
thing
to
do
after
having
fired
your
gun
is
to
reload
it
i
slipped
in
a
charge
keeping
my
eyes
on
the
bear
he
never
stirred
i
walked
back
suspiciously
there
was
a
quiver
in
the
hindlegs
but
no
other
motion
still
he
might
be
shamming
bears
often
sham
to
make
sure
i
approached
and
put
a
ball
into
his
head
he
did
mind
it
now
he
minded
nothing
death
had
come
to
him
with
a
merciful
suddenness
he
was
calm
in
death
in
order
that
he
might
remain
so
i
blew
his
brains
out
and
then
started
for
home
i
had
killed
a
bear
notwithstanding
my
excitement
i
managed
to
saunter
into
the
house
with
an
unconcerned
air
there
was
a
chorus
of
voices
are
your
blackberries
were
you
gone
so
long
your
pail
left
the
the
pail
what
for
bear
wanted
nonsense
the
last
i
saw
of
it
a
bear
had
come
you
did
really
see
a
bear
but
i
did
really
see
a
real
he
run
he
ran
after
do
believe
a
word
of
it
what
did
you
do
nothing
particular
except
kill
the
cries
of
believe
it
the
bear
you
want
to
see
the
bear
you
must
go
up
into
the
woods
i
bring
him
down
having
satisfied
the
household
that
something
extraordinary
had
occurred
and
excited
the
posthumous
fear
of
some
of
them
for
my
own
safety
i
went
down
into
the
valley
to
get
help
the
great
who
keeps
one
of
the
summer
received
my
story
with
a
smile
of
incredulity
and
the
incredulity
spread
to
the
other
inhabitants
and
to
the
boarders
as
soon
as
the
story
was
known
however
as
i
insisted
in
all
soberness
and
offered
to
lead
them
to
the
bear
a
party
of
forty
or
fifty
people
at
last
started
off
with
me
to
bring
the
bear
in
nobody
believed
there
was
any
bear
in
the
case
but
everybody
who
could
get
a
gun
carried
one
and
we
went
into
the
woods
armed
with
guns
pistols
pitchforks
and
sticks
against
all
contingencies
or
surprises
a
crowd
made
up
mostly
of
scoffers
and
jeerers
but
when
i
led
the
way
to
the
fatal
spot
and
pointed
out
the
bear
lying
peacefully
wrapped
in
his
own
skin
something
like
terror
seized
the
boarders
and
genuine
excitement
the
natives
it
was
a
bear
by
george
and
the
hero
of
the
fight
well
i
will
not
insist
upon
that
but
what
a
procession
that
was
carrying
the
bear
home
and
what
a
congregation
was
speedily
gathered
in
the
valley
to
see
the
bear
our
best
preacher
up
there
never
drew
anything
like
it
on
sunday
and
i
must
say
that
my
particular
friends
who
were
sportsmen
behaved
very
well
on
the
whole
they
did
deny
that
it
was
a
bear
although
they
said
it
was
small
for
a
bear
mr
deane
who
is
equally
good
with
a
rifle
and
a
rod
admitted
that
it
was
a
very
fair
shot
he
is
probably
the
best
salmon
fisher
in
the
united
states
and
he
is
an
equally
good
hunter
i
suppose
there
is
no
person
in
america
who
is
more
desirous
to
kill
a
moose
than
he
but
he
needlessly
remarked
after
he
had
examined
the
wound
in
the
bear
that
he
had
seen
that
kind
of
a
shot
made
by
a
cow
horn
this
sort
of
talk
affected
me
not
when
i
went
to
sleep
that
night
my
last
delicious
thought
was
killed
a
bear
ii
lost
in
the
woods
it
ought
to
be
said
by
way
of
explanation
that
my
being
lost
in
the
woods
was
not
premeditated
nothing
could
have
been
more
informal
this
apology
can
be
necessary
only
to
those
who
are
familiar
with
the
adirondack
literature
any
person
not
familiar
with
it
would
see
the
absurdity
of
one
going
to
the
northern
wilderness
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
writing
about
himself
as
a
lost
man
it
may
be
true
that
a
book
about
this
wild
tract
would
not
be
recognized
as
complete
without
a
story
in
it
since
it
is
almost
as
easy
for
a
stranger
to
get
lost
in
the
adirondacks
as
in
boston
i
merely
desire
to
say
that
my
unimportant
adventure
is
not
narrated
in
answer
to
the
popular
demand
and
i
do
not
wish
to
be
held
responsible
for
its
variation
from
the
typical
character
of
such
experiences
we
had
been
in
camp
a
week
on
the
upper
au
sable
lake
this
is
a
gem
emerald
or
turquoise
as
the
light
changes
it
set
in
the
virgin
forest
it
is
not
a
large
body
of
water
is
irregular
in
form
and
about
a
mile
and
a
half
in
length
but
in
the
sweep
of
its
wooded
shores
and
the
lovely
contour
of
the
lofty
mountains
that
guard
it
the
lake
is
probably
the
most
charming
in
america
why
the
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
camp
there
occasionally
vex
the
days
and
nights
with
hooting
and
singing
sentimental
songs
is
a
mystery
even
to
the
laughing
loon
i
left
my
companions
there
one
saturday
morning
to
return
to
keene
valley
intending
to
fish
down
the
au
sable
river
the
upper
lake
discharges
itself
into
the
lower
by
a
brook
which
winds
through
a
mile
and
a
half
of
swamp
and
woods
out
of
the
north
end
of
the
lower
lake
which
is
a
huge
sink
in
the
mountains
and
mirrors
the
savage
precipices
the
au
sable
breaks
its
rocky
barriers
and
flows
through
a
wild
gorge
several
miles
to
the
valley
below
between
the
lower
lake
and
the
settlements
is
an
extensive
forest
traversed
by
a
admirably
constructed
of
loose
stones
roots
of
trees
decayed
logs
slippery
rocks
and
mud
the
gorge
of
the
river
forms
its
western
boundary
i
followed
this
caricature
of
a
road
a
mile
or
more
then
gave
my
luggage
to
the
guide
to
carry
home
and
struck
off
through
the
forest
by
compass
to
the
river
i
promised
myself
an
exciting
scramble
down
this
canyon
and
a
creel
full
of
trout
there
was
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
river
or
in
descending
the
steep
precipice
to
its
bed
getting
into
a
scrape
is
usually
the
easiest
part
of
it
the
river
is
strewn
with
bowlders
big
and
little
through
which
the
amber
water
rushes
with
an
unceasing
thunderous
roar
now
plunging
down
in
white
falls
then
swirling
round
in
dark
pools
the
day
already
past
meridian
was
delightful
at
least
the
blue
strip
of
it
i
could
see
overhead
better
pools
and
rapids
for
trout
never
were
i
thought
as
i
concealed
myself
behind
a
bowlder
and
made
the
first
cast
there
is
nothing
like
the
thrill
of
expectation
over
the
first
throw
in
unfamiliar
waters
fishing
is
like
gambling
in
that
failure
only
excites
hope
of
a
fortunate
throw
next
time
there
was
no
rise
to
the
on
the
first
cast
nor
on
the
and
i
cautiously
worked
my
way
down
stream
throwing
right
and
left
when
i
had
gone
half
a
mile
my
opinion
of
the
character
of
the
pools
was
unchanged
never
were
there
such
places
for
trout
but
the
trout
were
out
of
their
places
perhaps
they
did
care
for
the
fly
some
trout
seem
to
be
so
unsophisticated
as
to
prefer
the
worm
i
replaced
the
fly
with
a
baited
hook
the
worm
squirmed
the
waters
rushed
and
roared
a
cloud
sailed
across
the
blue
no
trout
rose
to
the
lonesome
opportunity
there
is
a
certain
companionship
in
the
presence
of
trout
especially
when
you
can
feel
them
flopping
in
your
fish
basket
but
it
became
evident
that
there
were
no
trout
in
this
wilderness
and
a
sense
of
isolation
for
the
first
time
came
over
me
there
was
no
living
thing
near
the
river
had
by
this
time
entered
a
deeper
gorge
walls
of
rocks
rose
perpendicularly
on
either
side
picturesque
rocks
painted
many
colors
by
the
oxide
of
iron
it
was
not
possible
to
climb
out
of
the
gorge
it
was
impossible
to
find
a
way
by
the
side
of
the
river
and
getting
down
the
bed
over
the
falls
and
through
the
flumes
was
not
easy
and
consumed
time
was
that
thunder
very
likely
but
thunder
showers
are
always
brewing
in
these
mountain
fortresses
and
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
there
was
anything
personal
in
it
very
soon
however
the
hole
in
the
sky
closed
in
and
the
rain
dashed
down
it
seemed
a
providential
time
to
eat
my
luncheon
and
i
took
shelter
under
a
scraggy
pine
that
had
rooted
itself
in
the
edge
of
the
rocky
slope
the
shower
soon
passed
and
i
continued
my
journey
creeping
over
the
slippery
rocks
and
continuing
to
show
my
confidence
in
the
unresponsive
trout
the
way
grew
wilder
and
more
grewsome
the
thunder
began
again
rolling
along
over
the
tops
of
the
mountains
and
reverberating
in
sharp
concussions
in
the
gorge
the
lightning
also
darted
down
into
the
darkening
passage
and
then
the
rain
every
enlightened
being
even
if
he
is
in
a
fisherman
dress
of
shirt
and
pantaloons
hates
to
get
wet
and
i
ignominiously
crept
under
the
edge
of
a
sloping
bowlder
it
was
all
very
well
at
first
until
streams
of
water
began
to
crawl
along
the
face
of
the
rock
and
trickle
down
the
back
of
my
neck
this
was
refined
misery
unheroic
and
humiliating
as
suffering
always
is
when
unaccompanied
by
resignation
a
longer
time
than
i
knew
was
consumed
in
this
and
repeated
efforts
to
wait
for
the
slackening
and
renewing
storm
to
pass
away
in
the
intervals
of
calm
i
still
fished
and
even
descended
to
what
a
sportsman
considers
incredible
baseness
i
put
a
on
my
line
it
is
the
practice
of
the
country
folk
whose
only
object
is
to
get
fish
to
use
a
good
deal
of
bait
sink
the
hook
to
the
bottom
of
the
pools
and
wait
the
slow
appetite
of
the
summer
trout
i
tried
this
also
i
might
as
well
have
fished
in
a
pork
barrel
it
is
true
that
in
one
deep
black
round
pool
i
lured
a
small
trout
from
the
bottom
and
deposited
him
in
the
creel
but
it
was
an
accident
though
i
sat
there
in
the
awful
silence
the
roar
of
water
and
thunder
only
emphasized
the
stillness
full
half
an
hour
i
was
not
encouraged
by
another
nibble
hope
however
did
not
die
i
always
expected
to
find
the
trout
in
the
next
flume
and
so
i
toiled
slowly
on
unconscious
of
the
passing
time
at
each
turn
of
the
stream
i
expected
to
see
the
end
and
at
each
turn
i
saw
a
long
narrow
stretch
of
rocks
and
foaming
water
climbing
out
of
the
ravine
was
in
most
places
simply
impossible
and
i
began
to
look
with
interest
for
a
slide
where
bushes
rooted
in
the
scant
earth
would
enable
me
to
scale
the
precipice
i
did
not
doubt
that
i
was
nearly
through
the
gorge
i
could
at
length
see
the
huge
form
of
the
giant
of
the
valley
scarred
with
avalanches
at
the
end
of
the
vista
and
it
seemed
not
far
off
but
it
kept
its
distance
as
only
a
mountain
can
while
i
stumbled
and
slid
down
the
rocky
way
the
rain
had
now
set
in
with
persistence
and
suddenly
i
became
aware
that
it
was
growing
dark
and
i
said
to
myself
you
do
wish
to
spend
the
night
in
this
horrible
chasm
you
better
escape
fortunately
i
reached
a
place
where
the
face
of
the
precipice
was
bushgrown
and
with
considerable
labor
scrambled
up
it
having
no
doubt
that
i
was
within
half
a
mile
perhaps
within
a
few
rods
of
the
house
above
the
entrance
of
the
gorge
and
that
in
any
event
i
should
fall
into
the
in
a
few
minutes
i
struck
boldly
into
the
forest
congratulating
myself
on
having
escaped
out
of
the
river
so
sure
was
i
of
my
whereabouts
that
i
did
not
note
the
bend
of
the
river
nor
look
at
my
compass
the
one
trout
in
my
basket
was
no
burden
and
i
stepped
lightly
out
the
forest
was
of
and
open
except
for
a
thick
undergrowth
of
it
was
raining
in
fact
it
had
been
raining
more
or
less
for
a
month
and
the
woods
were
soaked
this
is
most
annoying
stuff
to
travel
through
in
a
rain
for
the
broad
leaves
slap
one
in
the
face
and
sop
him
with
wet
the
way
grew
every
moment
more
dingy
the
heavy
clouds
above
the
thick
foliage
brought
night
on
prematurely
it
was
decidedly
premature
to
a
man
whose
glasses
the
rain
rendered
useless
such
a
person
ought
to
be
at
home
early
on
leaving
the
river
bank
i
had
borne
to
the
left
so
as
to
be
sure
to
strike
either
the
clearing
or
the
road
and
not
wander
off
into
the
measureless
forest
i
confidently
pursued
this
course
and
went
gayly
on
by
the
left
flank
that
i
did
not
come
to
any
opening
or
path
only
showed
that
i
had
slightly
mistaken
the
distance
i
was
going
in
the
right
direction
i
was
so
certain
of
this
that
i
quickened
my
pace
and
got
up
with
alacrity
every
time
i
tumbled
down
amid
the
slippery
leaves
and
catching
roots
and
hurried
on
and
i
kept
to
the
left
it
even
occurred
to
me
that
i
was
turning
to
the
left
so
much
that
i
might
come
back
to
the
river
again
it
grew
more
dusky
and
rained
more
violently
but
there
was
nothing
alarming
in
the
situation
since
i
knew
exactly
where
i
was
it
was
a
little
mortifying
that
i
had
miscalculated
the
distance
yet
so
far
was
i
from
feeling
any
uneasiness
about
this
that
i
quickened
my
pace
again
and
before
i
knew
it
was
in
a
full
run
that
is
as
full
a
run
as
a
person
can
indulge
in
in
the
dusk
with
so
many
trees
in
the
way
no
nervousness
but
simply
a
reasonable
desire
to
get
there
i
desired
to
look
upon
myself
as
the
person
lost
but
gone
as
time
passed
and
darkness
fell
and
no
clearing
or
road
appeared
i
ran
a
little
faster
it
did
seem
possible
that
the
people
had
moved
or
the
road
been
changed
and
yet
i
was
sure
of
my
direction
i
went
on
with
an
energy
increased
by
the
ridiculousness
of
the
situation
the
danger
that
an
experienced
woodsman
was
in
of
getting
home
late
for
supper
the
lateness
of
the
meal
being
nothing
to
the
gibes
of
the
unlost
how
long
i
kept
this
course
and
how
far
i
went
on
i
do
not
know
but
suddenly
i
stumbled
against
an
tree
and
sat
down
on
the
soaked
ground
a
trifle
out
of
breath
it
then
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
better
verify
my
course
by
the
compass
there
was
scarcely
light
enough
to
distinguish
the
black
end
of
the
needle
to
my
amazement
the
compass
which
was
made
near
greenwich
was
wrong
allowing
for
the
natural
variation
of
the
needle
it
was
absurdly
wrong
it
made
out
that
i
was
going
south
when
i
was
going
north
it
intimated
that
instead
of
turning
to
the
left
i
had
been
making
a
circuit
to
the
right
according
to
the
compass
the
lord
only
knew
where
i
was
the
inclination
of
persons
in
the
woods
to
travel
in
a
circle
is
unexplained
i
suppose
it
arises
from
the
sympathy
of
the
legs
with
the
brain
most
people
reason
in
a
circle
their
minds
go
round
and
round
always
in
the
same
track
for
the
last
half
hour
i
had
been
saying
over
a
sentence
that
started
itself
wonder
where
that
road
is
i
had
said
it
over
till
it
had
lost
all
meaning
i
kept
going
round
on
it
and
yet
i
could
not
believe
that
my
body
had
been
traveling
in
a
circle
not
being
able
to
recognize
any
tracks
i
have
no
evidence
that
i
had
so
traveled
except
the
general
testimony
of
lost
men
the
compass
annoyed
me
i
known
experienced
guides
utterly
discredit
it
it
could
be
that
i
was
to
turn
about
and
go
the
way
i
had
come
nevertheless
i
said
to
myself
better
keep
a
cool
head
my
boy
or
you
are
in
for
a
night
of
it
better
listen
to
science
than
to
and
i
resolved
to
heed
the
impartial
needle
i
was
a
little
weary
of
the
rough
tramping
but
it
was
necessary
to
be
moving
for
with
wet
clothes
and
the
night
air
i
was
decidedly
chilly
i
turned
towards
the
north
and
slipped
and
stumbled
along
a
more
uninviting
forest
to
pass
the
night
in
i
never
saw
was
soaked
if
i
became
exhausted
it
would
be
necessary
to
build
a
fire
and
as
i
walked
on
i
could
find
a
dry
bit
of
wood
even
if
a
little
punk
were
discovered
in
a
rotten
log
i
had
no
hatchet
to
cut
fuel
i
thought
it
all
over
calmly
i
had
the
usual
three
matches
in
my
pocket
i
knew
exactly
what
would
happen
if
i
tried
to
build
a
fire
the
first
match
would
prove
to
be
wet
the
second
match
when
struck
would
shine
and
smell
and
fizz
a
little
and
then
go
out
there
would
be
only
one
match
left
death
would
ensue
if
it
failed
i
should
get
close
to
the
log
crawl
under
my
hat
strike
the
match
see
it
catch
flicker
almost
go
out
the
reader
painfully
excited
by
this
time
blaze
up
nearly
expire
and
finally
fire
the
punk
thank
god
and
i
said
to
myself
public
do
want
any
more
of
this
thing
it
is
played
out
either
have
a
box
of
matches
or
let
the
first
one
catch
in
this
gloomy
mood
i
plunged
along
the
prospect
was
cheerless
for
apart
from
the
comfort
that
a
fire
would
give
it
is
necessary
at
night
to
keep
off
the
wild
beasts
i
fancied
i
could
hear
the
tread
of
the
stealthy
brutes
following
their
prey
but
there
was
one
source
of
profound
satisfaction
the
catamount
had
been
killed
colvin
the
triangulating
surveyor
of
the
adirondacks
killed
him
in
his
last
official
report
to
the
state
whether
he
despatched
him
with
a
theodolite
or
a
barometer
does
not
matter
he
is
officially
dead
and
none
of
the
travelers
can
kill
him
any
more
yet
he
has
served
them
a
good
turn
i
knew
that
catamount
well
one
night
when
we
lay
in
the
bogs
of
the
south
beaver
meadow
under
a
canopy
of
mosquitoes
the
serene
midnight
was
parted
by
a
wild
and
humanlike
cry
from
a
neighboring
mountain
a
cat
said
the
guide
i
felt
in
a
moment
that
it
was
the
voice
of
culture
says
joseph
cook
in
a
most
impressive
period
culture
is
a
child
crying
in
the
wilderness
and
with
no
voice
but
a
that
describes
the
catamount
exactly
the
next
day
when
we
ascended
the
mountain
we
came
upon
the
traces
of
this
brute
a
spot
where
he
had
stood
and
cried
in
the
night
and
i
confess
that
my
hair
rose
with
the
consciousness
of
his
recent
presence
as
it
is
said
to
do
when
a
spirit
passes
by
whatever
consolation
the
absence
of
catamount
in
a
dark
drenched
and
howling
wilderness
can
impart
that
i
experienced
but
i
thought
what
a
satire
upon
my
present
condition
was
modern
culture
with
its
plain
thinking
and
high
living
it
was
impossible
to
get
much
satisfaction
out
of
the
real
and
the
ideal
the
me
and
the
at
this
time
what
impressed
me
most
was
the
absurdity
of
my
position
looked
at
in
the
light
of
modern
civilization
and
all
my
advantages
and
acquirements
it
seemed
pitiful
that
society
could
do
absolutely
nothing
for
me
it
was
in
fact
humiliating
to
reflect
that
it
would
now
be
profitable
to
exchange
all
my
possessions
for
the
woods
instinct
of
the
most
unlettered
guide
i
began
to
doubt
the
value
of
the
that
blunts
the
natural
instincts
it
began
to
be
a
question
whether
i
could
hold
out
to
walk
all
night
for
i
must
travel
or
perish
and
now
i
imagined
that
a
spectre
was
walking
by
my
side
this
was
famine
to
be
sure
i
had
only
recently
eaten
a
hearty
luncheon
but
the
pangs
of
hunger
got
hold
on
me
when
i
thought
that
i
should
have
no
supper
no
breakfast
and
as
the
procession
of
unattainable
meals
stretched
before
me
i
grew
hungrier
and
hungrier
i
could
feel
that
i
was
becoming
gaunt
and
wasting
away
already
i
seemed
to
be
emaciated
it
is
astonishing
how
speedily
a
jocund
human
being
can
be
transformed
into
a
spectacle
of
poverty
and
want
lose
a
man
in
the
woods
drench
him
tear
his
pantaloons
get
his
imagination
running
on
his
lost
supper
and
the
cheerful
fireside
that
is
expecting
him
and
he
will
become
haggard
in
an
hour
i
am
not
dwelling
upon
these
things
to
excite
the
sympathy
but
only
to
advise
him
if
he
contemplates
an
adventure
of
this
kind
to
provide
himself
with
matches
kindling
wood
something
more
to
eat
than
one
raw
trout
and
not
to
select
a
rainy
night
for
it
nature
is
so
pitiless
so
unresponsive
to
a
person
in
trouble
i
had
read
of
the
soothing
companionship
of
the
forest
the
pleasure
of
the
pathless
woods
but
i
thought
as
i
stumbled
along
in
the
dismal
actuality
that
if
i
ever
got
out
of
it
i
would
write
a
letter
to
the
newspapers
exposing
the
whole
thing
there
is
an
impassive
stolid
brutality
about
the
woods
that
has
never
been
enough
insisted
on
i
tried
to
keep
my
mind
fixed
upon
the
fact
of
man
superiority
to
nature
his
ability
to
dominate
and
outwit
her
my
situation
was
an
amusing
satire
on
this
theory
i
fancied
that
i
could
feel
a
sneer
in
the
woods
at
my
detected
conceit
there
was
something
personal
in
it
the
downpour
of
the
rain
and
the
slipperiness
of
the
ground
were
elements
of
discomfort
but
there
was
besides
these
a
kind
of
terror
in
the
very
character
of
the
forest
itself
i
think
this
arose
not
more
from
its
immensity
than
from
the
kind
of
stolidity
to
which
i
have
alluded
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
sort
of
relief
to
kick
the
trees
i
do
wonder
that
the
bears
fall
to
occasionally
and
scratch
the
bark
off
the
great
pines
and
maples
tearing
it
angrily
away
one
must
have
some
vent
to
his
feelings
it
is
a
common
experience
of
people
lost
in
the
woods
to
lose
their
heads
and
even
the
woodsmen
themselves
are
not
free
from
this
panic
when
some
accident
has
thrown
them
out
of
their
reckoning
fright
unsettles
the
judgment
the
oppressive
silence
of
the
woods
is
a
vacuum
in
which
the
mind
goes
astray
it
a
hollow
sham
this
pantheism
i
said
being
with
is
all
humbug
i
should
like
to
see
somebody
man
to
be
sure
is
of
very
little
account
and
soon
gets
beyond
his
depth
but
the
society
of
the
least
human
being
is
better
than
this
gigantic
indifference
the
on
the
lonely
is
agreeable
only
when
you
know
you
can
at
any
moment
go
home
i
had
now
given
up
all
expectation
of
finding
the
road
and
was
steering
my
way
as
well
as
i
could
northward
towards
the
valley
in
my
haste
i
made
slow
progress
probably
the
distance
i
traveled
was
short
and
the
time
consumed
not
long
but
i
seemed
to
be
adding
mile
to
mile
and
hour
to
hour
i
had
time
to
review
the
incidents
of
the
war
and
to
forecast
the
entire
eastern
question
i
outlined
the
characters
of
all
my
companions
left
in
camp
and
sketched
in
a
sort
of
comedy
the
sympathetic
and
disparaging
observations
they
would
make
on
my
adventure
i
repeated
something
like
a
thousand
times
without
contradiction
a
fool
you
were
to
leave
the
river
i
stopped
twenty
times
thinking
i
heard
its
loud
roar
always
deceived
by
the
wind
in
the
i
began
to
entertain
serious
doubts
about
the
compass
when
suddenly
i
became
aware
that
i
was
no
longer
on
level
ground
i
was
descending
a
slope
i
was
actually
in
a
ravine
in
a
moment
more
i
was
in
a
brook
newly
formed
by
the
rain
heaven
i
cried
i
shall
follow
whatever
conscience
or
the
compass
in
this
region
all
streams
go
sooner
or
later
into
the
valley
this
ravine
this
stream
no
doubt
led
to
the
river
i
splashed
and
tumbled
along
down
it
in
mud
and
water
down
hill
we
went
together
the
fall
showing
that
i
must
have
wandered
to
high
ground
when
i
guessed
that
i
must
be
close
to
the
river
i
suddenly
stepped
into
mud
up
to
my
ankles
it
was
the
road
running
of
course
the
wrong
way
but
still
the
blessed
road
it
was
a
mere
canal
of
liquid
mud
but
man
had
made
it
and
it
would
take
me
home
i
was
at
least
three
miles
from
the
point
i
supposed
i
was
near
at
sunset
and
i
had
before
me
a
toilsome
walk
of
six
or
seven
miles
most
of
the
way
in
a
ditch
but
it
is
truth
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
every
step
of
it
i
was
safe
i
knew
where
i
was
and
i
could
have
walked
till
morning
the
mind
had
again
got
the
upper
hand
of
the
body
and
began
to
plume
itself
on
its
superiority
it
was
even
disposed
to
doubt
whether
it
had
been
at
all
iii
a
fight
with
a
trout
trout
fishing
in
the
adirondacks
would
be
a
more
attractive
pastime
than
it
is
but
for
the
popular
notion
of
its
danger
the
trout
is
a
retiring
and
harmless
animal
except
when
he
is
aroused
and
forced
into
a
combat
and
then
his
agility
fierceness
and
vindictiveness
become
apparent
no
one
who
has
studied
the
excellent
pictures
representing
men
in
an
open
boat
exposed
to
the
assaults
of
long
enraged
trout
flying
at
them
through
the
open
air
with
open
mouth
ever
ventures
with
his
rod
upon
the
lonely
lakes
of
the
forest
without
a
certain
terror
or
ever
reads
of
the
exploits
of
daring
fishermen
without
a
feeling
of
admiration
for
their
heroism
most
of
their
adventures
are
thrilling
and
all
of
them
are
in
narration
more
or
less
unjust
to
the
trout
in
fact
the
object
of
them
seems
to
be
to
exhibit
at
the
expense
of
the
trout
the
shrewdness
the
skill
and
the
muscular
power
of
the
sportsman
my
own
simple
story
has
few
of
these
recommendations
we
had
built
our
bark
camp
one
summer
and
were
staying
on
one
of
the
popular
lakes
of
the
saranac
region
it
would
be
a
very
pretty
region
if
it
were
not
so
flat
if
the
margins
of
the
lakes
had
not
been
flooded
by
dams
at
the
outlets
which
have
killed
the
trees
and
left
a
rim
of
ghastly
deadwood
like
the
swamps
of
the
pictured
by
bizarre
pencil
and
if
the
pianos
at
the
hotels
were
in
tune
it
would
be
an
excellent
sporting
region
also
for
there
is
water
enough
if
the
fish
commissioners
would
stock
the
waters
and
if
previous
hunters
had
not
pulled
all
the
hair
and
skin
off
from
the
deers
tails
formerly
sportsmen
had
a
habit
of
catching
the
deer
by
the
tails
and
of
being
dragged
in
mere
wantonness
round
and
round
the
shores
it
is
well
known
that
if
you
seize
a
deer
by
this
the
skin
will
slip
off
like
the
peel
from
a
banana
this
reprehensible
practice
was
carried
so
far
that
the
traveler
is
now
hourly
pained
by
the
sight
of
deer
mournfully
sneaking
about
the
wood
we
had
been
hearing
for
weeks
of
a
small
lake
in
the
heart
of
the
virgin
forest
some
ten
miles
from
our
camp
which
was
alive
with
trout
unsophisticated
hungry
trout
the
inlet
to
it
was
described
as
stiff
with
them
in
my
imagination
i
saw
them
lying
there
in
ranks
and
rows
each
a
foot
long
three
tiers
deep
a
solid
mass
the
lake
had
never
been
visited
except
by
stray
sable
hunters
in
the
winter
and
was
known
as
the
unknown
pond
i
determined
to
explore
it
fully
expecting
however
that
it
would
prove
to
be
a
delusion
as
such
mysterious
haunts
of
the
trout
usually
are
confiding
my
purpose
to
luke
we
secretly
made
our
preparations
and
stole
away
from
the
shanty
one
morning
at
daybreak
each
of
us
carried
a
boat
a
pair
of
blankets
a
sack
of
bread
pork
and
while
i
had
my
case
of
rods
creel
and
book
of
flies
and
luke
had
an
axe
and
the
kitchen
utensils
we
think
nothing
of
loads
of
this
sort
in
the
woods
five
miles
through
a
tamarack
swamp
brought
us
to
the
inlet
of
unknown
pond
upon
which
we
embarked
our
fleet
and
paddled
down
its
vagrant
waters
they
were
at
first
sluggish
winding
among
triste
but
gradually
developed
a
strong
current
at
the
end
of
three
miles
a
loud
roar
ahead
warned
us
that
we
were
approaching
rapids
falls
and
cascades
we
paused
the
danger
was
unknown
we
had
our
choice
of
shouldering
our
loads
and
making
a
detour
through
the
woods
or
of
the
naturally
we
chose
the
more
dangerous
course
shooting
the
rapids
has
often
been
described
and
i
will
not
repeat
the
description
here
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
drove
my
frail
bark
through
the
boiling
rapids
over
the
successive
waterfalls
amid
rocks
and
vicious
eddies
and
landed
half
a
mile
below
with
whitened
hair
and
a
boat
half
full
of
water
and
that
the
guide
was
upset
and
boat
contents
and
man
were
strewn
along
the
shore
after
this
common
experience
we
went
quickly
on
our
journey
and
a
couple
of
hours
before
sundown
reached
the
lake
if
i
live
to
my
dying
day
i
never
shall
forget
its
appearance
the
lake
is
almost
an
exact
circle
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
diameter
the
forest
about
it
was
untouched
by
axe
and
unkilled
by
artificial
flooding
the
azure
water
had
a
perfect
setting
of
evergreens
in
which
all
the
shades
of
the
fir
the
balsam
the
pine
and
the
spruce
were
perfectly
blended
and
at
intervals
on
the
shore
in
the
emerald
rim
blazed
the
ruby
of
the
cardinal
flower
it
was
at
once
evident
that
the
unruffled
waters
had
never
been
vexed
by
the
keel
of
a
boat
but
what
chiefly
attracted
my
attention
and
amused
me
was
the
boiling
of
the
water
the
bubbling
and
breaking
as
if
the
lake
were
a
vast
kettle
with
a
fire
underneath
a
tyro
would
have
been
astonished
at
this
common
phenomenon
but
sportsmen
will
at
once
understand
me
when
i
say
that
the
water
boiled
with
the
breaking
trout
i
studied
the
surface
for
some
time
to
see
upon
what
sort
of
flies
they
were
feeding
in
order
to
suit
my
cast
to
their
appetites
but
they
seemed
to
be
at
play
rather
than
feeding
leaping
high
in
the
air
in
graceful
curves
and
tumbling
about
each
other
as
we
see
them
in
the
adirondack
pictures
it
is
well
known
that
no
person
who
regards
his
reputation
will
ever
kill
a
trout
with
anything
but
a
fly
it
requires
some
training
on
the
part
of
the
trout
to
take
to
this
method
the
uncultivated
unsophisticated
trout
in
unfrequented
waters
prefers
the
bait
and
the
rural
people
whose
sole
object
in
going
appears
to
be
to
catch
fish
indulge
them
in
their
primitive
taste
for
the
worm
no
sportsman
however
will
use
anything
but
a
fly
except
he
happens
to
be
alone
while
luke
launched
my
boat
and
arranged
his
seat
in
the
stern
i
prepared
my
rod
and
line
the
rod
is
a
bamboo
weighing
seven
ounces
which
has
to
be
spliced
with
a
winding
of
silk
thread
every
time
it
is
used
this
is
a
tedious
process
but
by
fastening
the
joints
in
this
way
a
uniform
spring
is
secured
in
the
rod
no
one
devoted
to
high
art
would
think
of
using
a
socket
joint
my
line
was
forty
yards
of
untwisted
silk
upon
a
multiplying
reel
the
i
am
very
particular
about
my
leaders
had
been
made
to
order
from
a
domestic
animal
with
which
i
had
been
acquainted
the
fisherman
requires
as
good
a
catgut
as
the
violinist
the
interior
of
the
house
cat
it
is
well
known
is
exceedingly
sensitive
but
it
may
not
be
so
well
known
that
the
reason
why
some
cats
leave
the
room
in
distress
when
a
is
played
is
because
the
two
instruments
are
not
in
the
same
key
and
the
vibrations
of
the
chords
of
the
one
are
in
discord
with
the
catgut
of
the
other
on
six
feet
of
this
superior
article
i
fixed
three
artificial
flies
a
simple
brown
hackle
a
gray
body
with
scarlet
wings
and
one
of
my
own
invention
which
i
thought
would
be
new
to
the
most
experienced
the
does
not
resemble
any
known
species
of
insect
it
is
a
creation
as
we
say
of
ornamentation
the
theory
is
that
being
a
high
art
the
fly
must
not
be
a
tame
imitation
of
nature
but
an
artistic
suggestion
of
it
it
requires
an
artist
to
construct
one
and
not
every
bungler
can
take
a
bit
of
red
flannel
a
peacock
feather
a
flash
of
tinsel
thread
a
cock
plume
a
section
of
a
hen
wing
and
fabricate
a
tiny
object
that
will
not
look
like
any
fly
but
still
will
suggest
the
universal
conventional
fly
i
took
my
stand
in
the
center
of
the
tipsy
boat
and
luke
shoved
off
and
slowly
paddled
towards
some
while
i
began
casting
unlimbering
my
tools
as
it
were
the
fish
had
all
disappeared
i
got
out
perhaps
fifty
feet
of
line
with
no
response
and
gradually
increased
it
to
one
hundred
it
is
not
difficult
to
learn
to
cast
but
it
is
difficult
to
learn
not
to
snap
off
the
flies
at
every
throw
of
this
however
we
will
not
speak
i
continued
casting
for
some
moments
until
i
became
satisfied
that
there
had
been
a
miscalculation
either
the
trout
were
too
green
to
know
what
i
was
at
or
they
were
dissatisfied
with
my
offers
i
reeled
in
and
changed
the
flies
that
is
the
fly
that
was
not
snapped
off
after
studying
the
color
of
the
sky
of
the
water
and
of
the
foliage
and
the
moderated
light
of
the
afternoon
i
put
on
a
series
of
beguilers
all
of
a
subdued
brilliancy
in
harmony
with
the
approach
of
evening
at
the
second
cast
which
was
a
short
one
i
saw
a
splash
where
the
leader
fell
and
gave
an
excited
jerk
the
next
instant
i
perceived
the
game
and
did
not
need
the
unfeigned
of
luke
to
convince
me
that
i
had
snatched
his
felt
hat
from
his
head
and
deposited
it
among
the
lilies
discouraged
by
this
we
whirled
about
and
paddled
over
to
the
inlet
where
a
little
ripple
was
visible
in
the
tinted
light
at
the
very
first
cast
i
saw
that
the
hour
had
come
three
trout
leaped
into
the
air
the
danger
of
this
manoeuvre
all
fishermen
understand
it
is
one
of
the
commonest
in
the
woods
three
heavy
trout
taking
hold
at
once
rushing
in
different
directions
smash
the
tackle
into
flinders
i
evaded
this
catch
and
threw
again
i
recall
the
moment
a
hermit
thrush
on
the
tip
of
a
balsam
uttered
his
long
liquid
evening
note
happening
to
look
over
my
shoulder
i
saw
the
peak
of
marcy
gleam
rosy
in
the
sky
i
ca
help
it
that
marcy
is
fifty
miles
off
and
can
not
be
seen
from
this
region
these
incidental
touches
are
always
used
the
hundred
feet
of
silk
swished
through
the
air
and
the
fell
as
lightly
on
the
water
as
a
piece
which
no
slamming
will
give
the
weight
of
a
ten
drops
upon
the
contribution
plate
instantly
there
was
a
rush
a
swirl
i
struck
and
him
by
never
mind
what
luke
said
i
got
him
by
on
a
fly
continued
that
irreverent
guide
but
i
told
him
to
back
water
and
make
for
the
center
of
the
lake
the
trout
as
soon
as
he
felt
the
prick
of
the
hook
was
off
like
a
shot
and
took
out
the
whole
of
the
line
with
a
rapidity
that
made
it
smoke
him
the
butt
shouted
luke
it
is
the
usual
remark
in
such
an
emergency
i
gave
him
the
butt
and
recognizing
the
fact
and
my
spirit
the
trout
at
once
sank
to
the
bottom
and
sulked
it
is
the
most
dangerous
mood
of
a
trout
for
you
can
not
tell
what
he
will
do
next
we
reeled
up
a
little
and
waited
five
minutes
for
him
to
reflect
a
tightening
of
the
line
enraged
him
and
he
soon
developed
his
tactics
coming
to
the
surface
he
made
straight
for
the
boat
faster
than
i
could
reel
in
and
evidently
with
hostile
intentions
out
for
him
cried
luke
as
he
came
flying
in
the
air
i
evaded
him
by
dropping
flat
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
when
i
picked
my
traps
up
he
was
spinning
across
the
lake
as
if
he
had
a
new
idea
but
the
line
was
still
fast
he
did
not
run
far
i
gave
him
the
butt
again
a
thing
he
seemed
to
hate
even
as
a
gift
in
a
moment
the
fish
lashing
the
water
in
his
rage
was
coming
back
again
making
straight
for
the
boat
as
before
luke
who
was
used
to
these
encounters
having
read
of
them
in
the
writings
of
travelers
he
had
accompanied
raised
his
paddle
in
the
trout
left
the
water
about
ten
feet
from
the
boat
and
came
directly
at
me
with
fiery
eyes
his
speckled
sides
flashing
like
a
meteor
i
dodged
as
he
whisked
by
with
a
vicious
slap
of
his
bifurcated
tail
and
nearly
upset
the
boat
the
line
was
of
course
slack
and
the
danger
was
that
he
would
entangle
it
about
me
and
carry
away
a
leg
this
was
evidently
his
game
but
i
untangled
it
and
only
lost
a
breast
button
or
two
by
the
string
the
trout
plunged
into
the
water
with
a
hissing
sound
and
went
away
again
with
all
the
line
on
the
reel
more
butt
more
indignation
on
the
part
of
the
captive
the
contest
had
now
been
going
on
for
half
an
hour
and
i
was
getting
exhausted
we
had
been
back
and
forth
across
the
lake
and
round
and
round
the
lake
what
i
feared
was
that
the
trout
would
start
up
the
inlet
and
wreck
us
in
the
bushes
but
he
had
a
new
fancy
and
began
the
execution
of
a
manoeuvre
which
i
had
never
read
of
instead
of
coming
straight
towards
me
he
took
a
large
circle
swimming
rapidly
and
gradually
contracting
his
orbit
i
reeled
in
and
kept
my
eye
on
him
round
and
round
he
went
narrowing
his
circle
i
began
to
suspect
the
game
which
was
to
twist
my
head
when
he
had
reduced
the
radius
of
his
circle
to
about
feet
he
struck
a
tremendous
pace
through
the
water
it
would
be
false
modesty
in
a
sportsman
to
say
that
i
was
not
equal
to
the
occasion
instead
of
turning
round
with
him
as
he
expected
i
stepped
to
the
bow
braced
myself
and
let
the
boat
swing
round
went
the
fish
and
round
we
went
like
a
top
i
saw
a
line
of
mount
marcys
all
round
the
horizon
the
rosy
tint
in
the
west
made
a
broad
band
of
pink
along
the
sky
above
the
the
evening
star
was
a
perfect
circle
of
light
a
hoop
of
gold
in
the
heavens
we
whirled
and
reeled
and
reeled
and
whirled
i
was
willing
to
give
the
malicious
beast
butt
and
line
and
all
if
he
would
only
go
the
other
way
for
a
change
when
i
came
to
myself
luke
was
gaffing
the
trout
at
the
after
we
had
got
him
in
and
dressed
him
he
weighed
of
a
pound
fish
always
lose
by
being
in
and
it
is
best
to
weigh
them
while
they
are
in
the
water
the
only
really
large
one
i
ever
caught
got
away
with
my
leader
when
i
first
struck
him
he
weighed
ten
pounds
iv
of
the
deer
if
civilization
owes
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
sportsmen
who
have
cleared
the
adirondack
regions
of
catamounts
and
savage
trout
what
shall
be
said
of
the
army
which
has
so
nobly
relieved
them
of
the
terror
of
the
deer
the
have
somewhat
celebrated
their
exploits
in
print
but
i
think
that
justice
has
never
been
done
them
the
american
deer
in
the
wilderness
left
to
himself
leads
a
comparatively
harmless
but
rather
stupid
life
with
only
such
excitement
as
his
own
timid
fancy
raises
it
was
very
seldom
that
one
of
his
tribe
was
eaten
by
the
north
american
tiger
for
a
wild
animal
he
is
very
domestic
simple
in
his
tastes
regular
in
his
habits
affectionate
in
his
family
unfortunately
for
his
repose
his
haunch
is
as
tender
as
his
heart
of
all
wild
creatures
he
is
one
of
the
most
graceful
in
action
and
he
poses
with
the
skill
of
an
experienced
model
i
have
seen
the
goats
on
mount
pentelicus
scatter
at
the
approach
of
a
stranger
climb
to
the
sharp
points
of
projecting
rocks
and
attitudinize
in
the
most
manner
striking
at
once
those
picturesque
postures
against
the
sky
with
which
oriental
pictures
have
made
us
and
them
familiar
but
the
whole
proceeding
was
theatrical
greece
is
the
home
of
art
and
it
is
rare
to
find
anything
there
natural
and
unstudied
i
presume
that
these
goats
have
no
nonsense
about
them
when
they
are
alone
with
the
goatherds
any
more
than
the
goatherds
have
except
when
they
come
to
pose
in
the
studio
but
the
long
ages
of
culture
the
presence
always
to
the
eye
of
the
best
models
and
the
forms
of
immortal
beauty
the
heroic
friezes
of
the
temple
of
theseus
the
marble
processions
of
sacrificial
animals
have
had
a
steady
molding
educating
influence
equal
to
a
society
of
decorative
art
upon
the
people
and
the
animals
who
have
dwelt
in
this
artistic
atmosphere
the
attic
goat
has
become
an
artificially
artistic
being
though
of
course
he
is
not
now
what
he
was
as
a
poser
in
the
days
of
polycletus
there
is
opportunity
for
a
very
instructive
essay
by
freeman
on
the
decadence
of
the
attic
goat
under
the
influence
of
the
ottoman
turk
the
american
deer
in
the
free
atmosphere
of
our
country
and
as
yet
untouched
by
our
decorative
art
is
without
and
all
his
attitudes
are
free
and
unstudied
the
favorite
position
of
the
deer
his
in
the
shallow
margin
of
the
lake
among
the
his
antlers
thrown
back
and
his
nose
in
the
air
at
the
moment
he
hears
the
stealthy
breaking
of
a
twig
in
the
forest
is
still
spirited
and
graceful
and
wholly
unaffected
by
the
pictures
of
him
which
the
artists
have
put
upon
canvas
wherever
you
go
in
the
northern
forest
you
will
find
so
plainly
marked
and
are
they
that
it
is
easy
to
mistake
them
for
trails
made
by
hunters
but
he
who
follows
one
of
them
is
soon
in
difficulties
he
may
find
himself
climbing
through
cedar
thickets
an
almost
inaccessible
cliff
or
immersed
in
the
intricacies
of
a
marsh
the
in
one
direction
will
lead
to
water
but
in
the
other
it
climbs
the
highest
hills
to
which
the
deer
retires
for
safety
and
repose
in
impenetrable
thickets
the
hunters
in
winter
find
them
congregated
in
where
they
can
be
surrounded
and
shot
as
easily
as
our
troops
shoot
comanche
women
and
children
in
their
winter
villages
these
little
paths
are
full
of
pitfalls
among
the
roots
and
stones
and
nimble
as
the
deer
is
he
sometimes
breaks
one
of
his
slender
legs
in
them
yet
he
knows
how
to
treat
himself
without
a
surgeon
i
knew
of
a
tame
deer
in
a
settlement
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
who
had
the
misfortune
to
break
her
leg
she
immediately
disappeared
with
a
delicacy
rare
in
an
invalid
and
was
not
seen
for
two
weeks
her
friends
had
given
her
up
supposing
that
she
had
dragged
herself
away
into
the
depths
of
the
woods
and
died
of
starvation
when
one
day
she
returned
cured
of
lameness
but
thin
as
a
virgin
shadow
she
had
the
sense
to
shun
the
doctor
to
lie
down
in
some
safe
place
and
patiently
wait
for
her
leg
to
heal
i
have
observed
in
many
of
the
more
refined
animals
this
sort
of
shyness
and
reluctance
to
give
trouble
which
excite
our
admiration
when
noticed
in
mankind
the
deer
is
called
a
timid
animal
and
taunted
with
possessing
courage
only
when
he
is
the
stag
will
fight
when
he
can
no
longer
flee
and
the
doe
will
defend
her
young
in
the
face
of
murderous
enemies
the
deer
gets
little
credit
for
this
bravery
but
i
think
that
in
any
truly
christian
condition
of
society
the
deer
would
not
be
conspicuous
for
cowardice
i
suppose
that
if
the
american
girl
even
as
she
is
described
in
foreign
romances
were
pursued
by
and
fired
at
from
behind
fences
every
time
she
ventured
outdoors
she
would
become
timid
and
reluctant
to
go
abroad
when
that
golden
era
comes
which
the
poets
think
is
behind
us
and
the
prophets
declare
is
about
to
be
ushered
in
by
the
opening
of
the
and
the
killing
of
everybody
who
does
not
believe
as
those
nations
believe
which
have
the
most
cannon
when
we
all
live
in
real
concord
perhaps
the
deer
will
be
respected
and
will
find
that
men
are
not
more
savage
to
the
weak
than
are
the
cougars
and
panthers
if
the
little
spotted
fawn
can
think
it
must
seem
to
her
a
queer
world
in
which
the
advent
of
innocence
is
hailed
by
the
baying
of
fierce
hounds
and
the
of
the
rifle
hunting
the
deer
in
the
adirondacks
is
conducted
in
the
most
manly
fashion
there
are
several
methods
and
in
none
of
them
is
a
fair
chance
to
the
deer
considered
a
favorite
method
with
the
natives
is
practiced
in
winter
and
is
called
by
them
my
idea
of
still
hunting
is
for
one
man
to
go
alone
into
the
forest
look
about
for
a
deer
put
his
wits
fairly
against
the
wits
of
the
animal
and
kill
his
deer
or
get
lost
in
the
attempt
there
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
fairness
about
this
it
is
private
assassination
tempered
with
a
little
uncertainty
about
finding
your
man
the
still
hunting
of
the
natives
has
all
the
romance
and
danger
attending
the
slaughter
of
sheep
in
an
abattoir
as
the
snow
gets
deep
many
deer
congregate
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
and
keep
a
place
trodden
down
which
grows
larger
as
they
tramp
down
the
snow
in
search
of
food
in
time
this
refuge
becomes
a
sort
of
surrounded
by
unbroken
the
hunters
then
make
their
way
to
this
retreat
on
snowshoes
and
from
the
top
of
the
banks
pick
off
the
deer
at
leisure
with
their
rifles
and
haul
them
away
to
market
until
the
enclosure
is
pretty
much
emptied
this
is
one
of
the
surest
methods
of
exterminating
the
deer
it
is
also
one
of
the
most
merciful
and
being
the
plan
adopted
by
our
government
for
civilizing
the
indian
it
ought
to
be
popular
the
only
people
who
object
to
it
are
the
summer
sportsmen
they
naturally
want
some
pleasure
out
of
the
death
of
the
deer
some
of
our
best
sportsmen
who
desire
to
protract
the
pleasure
of
slaying
deer
through
as
many
seasons
as
possible
object
to
the
practice
of
the
hunters
who
make
it
their
chief
business
to
slaughter
as
many
deer
in
a
camping
season
as
they
can
their
own
rule
they
say
is
to
kill
a
deer
only
when
they
need
venison
to
eat
their
excuse
is
specious
what
right
have
these
sophists
to
put
themselves
into
a
desert
place
out
of
the
reach
of
provisions
and
then
ground
a
right
to
slay
deer
on
their
own
improvidence
if
it
is
necessary
for
these
people
to
have
anything
to
eat
which
i
doubt
it
is
not
necessary
that
they
should
have
the
luxury
of
venison
one
of
the
most
picturesque
methods
of
hunting
the
poor
deer
is
called
the
person
with
murder
in
his
heart
chooses
a
cloudy
night
seats
himself
rifle
in
hand
in
a
canoe
which
is
noiselessly
paddled
by
the
guide
and
explores
the
shore
of
the
lake
or
the
dark
inlet
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
is
a
light
in
a
the
rays
of
which
are
shielded
from
the
boat
and
its
occupants
a
deer
comes
down
to
feed
upon
the
the
boat
approaches
him
he
looks
up
and
stands
a
moment
terrified
or
fascinated
by
the
bright
flames
in
that
moment
the
sportsman
is
supposed
to
shoot
the
deer
as
an
historical
fact
his
hand
usually
shakes
so
that
he
misses
the
animal
or
only
wounds
him
and
the
stag
limps
away
to
die
after
days
of
suffering
usually
however
the
hunters
remain
out
all
night
get
stiff
from
cold
and
the
cramped
position
in
the
boat
and
when
they
return
in
the
morning
to
camp
cloud
their
future
existence
by
the
assertion
that
they
a
big
moving
along
the
shore
but
the
people
in
camp
made
so
much
noise
that
he
was
frightened
off
by
all
odds
the
favorite
and
prevalent
mode
is
hunting
with
dogs
the
dogs
do
the
hunting
the
men
the
killing
the
hounds
are
sent
into
the
forest
to
rouse
the
deer
and
drive
him
from
his
cover
they
climb
the
mountains
strike
the
trails
and
go
baying
and
yelping
on
the
track
of
the
poor
beast
the
deer
have
their
established
runways
as
i
said
and
when
they
are
disturbed
in
their
retreat
they
are
certain
to
attempt
to
escape
by
following
one
which
invariably
leads
to
some
lake
or
stream
all
that
the
hunter
has
to
do
is
to
seat
himself
by
one
of
these
runways
or
sit
in
a
boat
on
the
lake
and
wait
the
coming
of
the
pursued
deer
the
frightened
beast
fleeing
from
the
unreasoning
brutality
of
the
hounds
will
often
seek
the
open
country
with
a
mistaken
confidence
in
the
humanity
of
man
to
kill
a
deer
when
he
suddenly
passes
one
on
a
runway
demands
presence
of
mind
and
quickness
of
aim
to
shoot
him
from
the
boat
after
he
has

its
charms
for

even

it
can
not
be

that
we
are
so
constituted
by
a
wise
creator
as
to
feel
a
delight
in
killing
a
wild
animal
which
we
do
not

excitement
of

from
the

point
of
view
i
happen
to
be
in
a
position
by
reason
of
a
lucky
adirondack
experience
to
present
it
in
that
light
i
am
sorry
if
this
introduction
to
my
little
story
has
seemed
long
to
the
reader
it
is
too
late
now
to
skip
it
but
he
can
recoup
himself
by
omitting
the
story
early
on
the
morning
of
the
of
august
a
doe
was
feeding
on
basin
mountain
the
night
had
been
warm
and
showery
and
the
morning
opened
in
an
undecided
way
the
wind
was
southerly
it
is
what
the
deer
call
a
having
come
to
know
quite
well
the
meaning
of
southerly
wind
and
a
cloudy
the
sole
companion
of
the
doe
was
her
only
child
a
charming
little
fawn
whose
brown
coat
was
just
beginning
to
be
mottled
with
the
beautiful
spots
which
make
this
young
creature
as
lovely
as
the
gazelle
the
buck
its
father
had
been
that
night
on
a
long
tramp
across
the
mountain
to
clear
pond
and
had
not
yet
returned
he
went
ostensibly
to
feed
on
the
succulent
there
feedeth
among
the
lilies
until
the
day
break
and
the
shadows
flee
away
and
he
should
be
here
by
this
hour
but
he
cometh
not
she
said
upon
the
mountains
skipping
upon
the
clear
pond
was
too
far
off
for
the
young
mother
to
go
with
her
fawn
for
a
night
pleasure
it
was
a
fashionable
at
this
season
among
the
deer
and
the
doe
may
have
remembered
not
without
uneasiness
the
moonlight
meetings
of
a
frivolous
society
there
but
the
buck
did
not
come
he
was
very
likely
sleeping
under
one
of
the
ledges
on
tight
nippin
was
he
alone
charge
you
by
the
roes
and
by
the
hinds
of
the
field
that
ye
stir
not
nor
awake
my
love
till
he
the
doe
was
feeding
daintily
cropping
the
tender
leaves
of
the
young
shoots
and
turning
from
time
to
time
to
regard
her
offspring
the
fawn
had
taken
his
morning
meal
and
now
lay
curled
up
on
a
bed
of
moss
watching
contentedly
with
his
large
soft
brown
eyes
every
movement
of
his
mother
the
great
eyes
followed
her
with
an
alert
entreaty
and
if
the
mother
stepped
a
pace
or
two
farther
away
in
feeding
the
fawn
made
a
half
movement
as
if
to
rise
and
follow
her
you
see
she
was
his
sole
dependence
in
all
the
world
but
he
was
quickly
reassured
when
she
turned
her
gaze
on
him
and
if
in
alarm
he
uttered
a
plaintive
cry
she
bounded
to
him
at
once
and
with
every
demonstration
of
affection
licked
his
mottled
skin
till
it
shone
again
it
was
a
pretty
picture
maternal
love
on
the
one
part
and
happy
trust
on
the
other
the
doe
was
a
beauty
and
would
have
been
so
considered
anywhere
as
graceful
and
winning
a
creature
as
the
sun
that
day
shone
on
slender
limbs
not
too
heavy
flanks
round
body
and
aristocratic
head
with
small
ears
and
luminous
intelligent
affectionate
eyes
how
alert
supple
free
she
was
what
untaught
grace
in
every
movement
what
a
charming
pose
when
she
lifted
her
head
and
turned
it
to
regard
her
child
you
would
have
had
a
companion
picture
if
you
had
seen
as
i
saw
that
morning
a
baby
kicking
about
among
the
dry
on
a
ledge
above
the
au
sable
in
the
valley
below
while
its
young
mother
sat
near
with
an
easel
before
her
touching
in
the
color
of
a
reluctant
landscape
giving
a
quick
look
at
the
sky
and
the
outline
of
the
twin
mountains
and
bestowing
every
third
glance
upon
the
laughing
boy
art
in
its
infancy
the
doe
lifted
her
head
a
little
with
a
quick
motion
and
turned
her
ear
to
the
south
had
she
heard
something
probably
it
was
only
the
south
wind
in
the
balsams
there
was
silence
all
about
in
the
forest
if
the
doe
had
heard
anything
it
was
one
of
the
distant
noises
of
the
world
there
are
in
the
woods
occasional
moanings
premonitions
of
change
which
are
inaudible
to
the
dull
ears
of
men
but
which
i
have
no
doubt
the
hear
and
understand
if
the
doe
suspicions
were
excited
for
an
instant
they
were
gone
as
soon
with
an
affectionate
glance
at
her
fawn
she
continued
picking
up
her
breakfast
but
suddenly
she
started
head
erect
eyes
dilated
a
tremor
in
her
limbs
she
took
a
step
she
turned
her
head
to
the
south
she
listened
intently
there
was
a
sound
a
distant
prolonged
note
pervading
the
woods
shaking
the
air
in
smooth
vibrations
it
was
repeated
the
doe
had
no
doubt
now
she
shook
like
the
sensitive
mimosa
when
a
footstep
approaches
it
was
the
baying
of
a
hound
it
was
far
off
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
time
enough
to
fly
time
enough
to
put
miles
between
her
and
the
hound
before
he
should
come
upon
her
fresh
trail
time
enough
to
escape
away
through
the
dense
forest
and
hide
in
the
recesses
of
panther
gorge
yes
time
enough
but
there
was
the
fawn
the
cry
of
the
hound
was
repeated
more
distinct
this
time
the
mother
instinctively
bounded
away
a
few
paces
the
fawn
started
up
with
an
anxious
bleat
the
doe
turned
she
came
back
she
could
leave
it
she
bent
over
it
and
licked
it
and
seemed
to
say
my
child
we
are
pursued
we
must
she
walked
away
towards
the
west
and
the
little
thing
skipped
after
her
it
was
slow
going
for
the
slender
legs
over
the
fallen
logs
and
through
the
rasping
bushes
the
doe
bounded
in
advance
and
waited
the
fawn
scrambled
after
her
slipping
and
tumbling
along
very
groggy
yet
on
its
legs
and
whining
a
good
deal
because
its
mother
kept
always
moving
away
from
it
the
fawn
evidently
did
not
hear
the
hound
the
little
innocent
would
even
have
looked
sweetly
at
the
dog
and
tried
to
make
friends
with
it
if
the
brute
had
been
rushing
upon
him
by
all
the
means
at
her
command
the
doe
urged
her
young
one
on
but
it
was
slow
work
she
might
have
been
a
mile
away
while
they
were
making
a
few
rods
whenever
the
fawn
caught
up
he
was
quite
content
to
frisk
about
he
wanted
more
breakfast
for
one
thing
and
his
mother
would
stand
still
she
moved
on
continually
and
his
weak
legs
were
tangled
in
the
roots
of
the
narrow
shortly
came
a
sound
that
threw
the
doe
into
a
panic
of
terror
a
short
sharp
yelp
followed
by
a
prolonged
howl
caught
up
and
reechoed
by
other
bayings
along
the
the
doe
knew
what
that
meant
one
hound
had
caught
her
trail
and
the
whole
pack
responded
to
the
the
danger
was
certain
now
it
was
near
she
could
not
crawl
on
in
this
way
the
dogs
would
soon
be
upon
them
she
turned
again
for
flight
the
fawn
scrambling
after
her
tumbled
over
and
bleated
piteously
the
baying
emphasized
now
by
the
yelp
of
certainty
came
nearer
flight
with
the
fawn
was
impossible
the
doe
returned
and
stood
by
it
head
erect
and
nostrils
distended
she
stood
perfectly
still
but
trembling
perhaps
she
was
thinking
the
fawn
took
advantage
of
the
situation
and
began
to
draw
his
luncheon
ration
the
doe
seemed
to
have
made
up
her
mind
she
let
him
finish
the
fawn
having
taken
all
he
wanted
lay
down
contentedly
and
the
doe
licked
him
for
a
moment
then
with
the
swiftness
of
a
bird
she
dashed
away
and
in
a
moment
was
lost
in
the
forest
she
went
in
the
direction
of
the
hounds
according
to
all
human
calculations
she
was
going
into
the
jaws
of
death
so
she
was
all
human
calculations
are
selfish
she
kept
straight
on
hearing
the
baying
every
moment
more
distinctly
she
descended
the
slope
of
the
mountain
until
she
reached
the
more
open
forest
of
it
was
freer
going
here
and
the
cry
of
the
pack
echoed
more
resoundingly
in
the
great
spaces
she
was
going
due
east
when
judging
by
the
sound
the
hounds
were
not
far
off
though
they
were
still
hidden
by
a
ridge
she
turned
short
away
to
the
north
and
kept
on
at
a
good
pace
in
five
minutes
more
she
heard
the
sharp
exultant
yelp
of
discovery
and
then
the
howl
of
pursuit
the
hounds
had
struck
her
trail
where
she
turned
and
the
fawn
was
safe
the
doe
was
in
good
running
condition
the
ground
was
not
bad
and
she
felt
the
exhilaration
of
the
chase
for
the
moment
fear
left
her
and
she
bounded
on
with
the
exaltation
of
triumph
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
went
on
at
a
slapping
pace
clearing
the
with
bound
after
bound
flying
over
the
fallen
logs
pausing
neither
for
brook
nor
ravine
the
baying
of
the
hounds
grew
fainter
behind
her
but
she
struck
a
bad
piece
of
going
a
slash
it
was
marvelous
to
see
her
skim
over
it
leaping
among
its
intricacies
and
not
breaking
her
slender
legs
no
other
living
animal
could
do
it
but
it
was
killing
work
she
began
to
pant
fearfully
she
lost
ground
the
baying
of
the
hounds
was
nearer
she
climbed
the
hill
at
a
slower
gait
but
once
on
more
level
free
ground
her
breath
came
back
to
her
and
she
stretched
away
with
new
courage
and
maybe
a
sort
of
contempt
of
her
heavy
pursuers
after
running
at
high
speed
perhaps
half
a
mile
farther
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
would
be
safe
now
to
turn
to
the
west
and
by
a
wide
circuit
seek
her
fawn
but
at
the
moment
she
heard
a
sound
that
chilled
her
heart
it
was
the
cry
of
a
hound
to
the
west
of
her
the
crafty
brute
had
made
the
circuit
of
the
slash
and
cut
off
her
retreat
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
on
and
on
she
went
still
to
the
north
with
the
noise
of
the
pack
behind
her
in
five
minutes
more
she
had
passed
into
a
hillside
clearing
cows
and
young
steers
were
grazing
there
she
heard
a
tinkle
of
bells
below
her
down
the
mountain
slope
were
other
clearings
broken
by
patches
of
woods
fences
intervened
and
a
mile
or
two
down
lay
the
valley
the
shining
au
sable
and
the
peaceful
farmhouses
that
way
also
her
hereditary
enemies
were
not
a
merciful
heart
in
all
that
lovely
valley
she
hesitated
it
was
only
for
an
instant
she
must
cross
the
slidebrook
valley
if
possible
and
gain
the
mountain
opposite
she
bounded
on
she
stopped
what
was
that
from
the
valley
ahead
came
the
cry
of
a
searching
hound
all
the
devils
were
loose
this
morning
every
way
was
closed
but
one
and
that
led
straight
down
the
mountain
to
the
cluster
of
houses
conspicuous
among
them
was
a
slender
white
wooden
spire
the
doe
did
not
know
that
it
was
the
spire
of
a
christian
chapel
but
perhaps
she
thought
that
human
pity
dwelt
there
and
would
be
more
merciful
than
the
teeth
of
the
hounds
hounds
are
baying
on
my
track
o
white
man
will
you
send
me
back
in
a
panic
frightened
animals
will
always
flee
to
from
the
danger
of
more
savage
foes
they
always
make
a
mistake
in
doing
so
perhaps
the
trait
is
the
survival
of
an
era
of
peace
on
earth
perhaps
it
is
a
prophecy
of
the
golden
age
of
the
future
the
business
of
this
age
is
murder
the
slaughter
of
animals
the
slaughter
of
by
the
wholesale
hilarious
poets
who
have
never
fired
a
gun
write
and
good
bishops
write
ave
the
czar
the
hunted
doe
went
down
the
clearing
the
fences
splendidly
flying
along
the
stony
path
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
but
consider
what
a
shot
it
was
if
the
deer
now
could
only
have
been
caught
i
no
doubt
there
were
tenderhearted
people
in
the
valley
who
would
have
spared
her
life
shut
her
up
in
a
stable
and
petted
her
was
there
one
who
would
have
let
her
go
back
to
her
it
is
the
business
of
civilization
to
tame
or
kill
the
doe
went
on
she
left
the
sawmill
on
john
brook
to
her
right
she
turned
into
a
as
she
approached
slide
brook
she
saw
a
boy
standing
by
a
tree
with
a
raised
rifle
the
dogs
were
not
in
sight
but
she
could
hear
them
coming
down
the
hill
there
was
no
time
for
hesitation
with
a
tremendous
burst
of
speed
she
cleared
the
stream
and
as
she
touched
the
bank
heard
the
of
a
rifle
bullet
in
the
air
above
her
the
cruel
sound
gave
wings
to
the
poor
thing
in
a
moment
more
she
was
in
the
opening
she
leaped
into
the
traveled
road
which
way
below
her
in
the
wood
was
a
load
of
hay
a
man
and
a
boy
with
pitchforks
in
their
hands
were
running
towards
her
she
turned
south
and
flew
along
the
street
the
town
was
up
women
and
children
ran
to
the
doors
and
windows
men
snatched
their
rifles
shots
were
fired
at
the
big
the
summer
boarders
who
never
have
anything
to
do
came
out
and
cheered
a
campstool
was
thrown
from
a
veranda
some
young
fellows
shooting
at
a
mark
in
the
meadow
saw
the
flying
deer
and
popped
away
at
her
but
they
were
accustomed
to
a
mark
that
stood
still
it
was
all
so
sudden
there
were
twenty
people
who
were
just
going
to
shoot
her
when
the
doe
leaped
the
road
fence
and
went
away
across
a
marsh
toward
the
foothills
it
was
a
fearful
gauntlet
to
run
but
nobody
except
the
deer
considered
it
in
that
light
everybody
told
what
he
was
just
going
to
do
everybody
who
had
seen
the
performance
was
a
kind
of
hero
everybody
except
the
deer
for
days
and
days
it
was
the
subject
of
conversation
and
the
summer
boarders
kept
their
guns
at
hand
expecting
another
deer
would
come
to
be
shot
at
the
doe
went
away
to
the
foothills
going
now
slower
and
evidently
fatigued
if
not
frightened
half
to
death
nothing
is
so
appalling
to
a
recluse
as
half
a
mile
of
summer
boarders
as
the
deer
entered
the
thin
woods
she
saw
a
rabble
of
people
start
across
the
meadow
in
pursuit
by
this
time
the
dogs
panting
and
lolling
out
their
tongues
came
swinging
along
keeping
the
trail
like
stupids
and
consequently
losing
ground
when
the
deer
doubled
but
when
the
doe
had
got
into
the
timber
she
heard
the
savage
brutes
howling
across
the
meadow
it
is
well
enough
perhaps
to
say
that
nobody
offered
to
shoot
the
dogs
the
courage
of
the
panting
fugitive
was
not
gone
she
was
game
to
the
tip
of
her
ears
but
the
fearful
pace
at
which
she
had
just
been
going
told
on
her
her
legs
trembled
and
her
heart
beat
like
a
she
slowed
her
speed
perforce
but
still
fled
industriously
up
the
right
bank
of
the
stream
when
she
had
gone
a
couple
of
miles
and
the
dogs
were
evidently
gaining
again
she
crossed
the
broad
deep
brook
climbed
the
steep
left
bank
and
fled
on
in
the
direction
of
the
trail
the
fording
of
the
river
threw
the
hounds
off
for
a
time
she
knew
by
their
uncertain
yelping
up
and
down
the
opposite
bank
that
she
had
a
little
respite
she
used
it
however
to
push
on
until
the
baying
was
faint
in
her
ears
and
then
she
dropped
exhausted
upon
the
ground
this
rest
brief
as
it
was
saved
her
life
roused
again
by
the
baying
pack
she
leaped
forward
with
better
speed
though
without
that
keen
feeling
of
exhilarating
flight
that
she
had
in
the
morning
it
was
still
a
race
for
life
but
the
odds
were
in
her
favor
she
thought
she
did
not
appreciate
the
dogged
persistence
of
the
hounds
nor
had
any
inspiration
told
her
that
the
race
is
not
to
the
swift
she
was
a
little
confused
in
her
mind
where
to
go
but
an
instinct
kept
her
course
to
the
left
and
consequently
farther
away
from
her
fawn
going
now
slower
and
now
faster
as
the
pursuit
seemed
more
distant
or
nearer
she
kept
to
the
southwest
crossed
the
stream
again
left
panther
gorge
on
her
right
and
ran
on
by
haystack
and
skylight
in
the
direction
of
the
upper
au
sable
pond
i
do
not
know
her
exact
course
through
this
maze
of
mountains
swamps
ravines
and
frightful
wildernesses
i
only
know
that
the
poor
thing
worked
her
way
along
painfully
with
sinking
heart
and
unsteady
limbs
lying
down
at
intervals
and
then
spurred
on
by
the
cry
of
the
remorseless
dogs
until
late
in
the
afternoon
she
staggered
down
the
shoulder
of
bartlett
and
stood
upon
the
shore
of
the
lake
if
she
could
put
that
piece
of
water
between
her
and
her
pursuers
she
would
be
safe
had
she
strength
to
swim
it
at
her
first
step
into
the
water
she
saw
a
sight
that
sent
her
back
with
a
bound
there
was
a
boat
two
men
were
in
it
one
was
rowing
the
other
had
a
gun
in
his
hand
they
were
looking
towards
her
they
had
seen
her
she
did
not
know
that
they
had
heard
the
baying
of
hounds
on
the
mountains
and
had
been
lying
in
wait
for
her
an
hour
what
should
she
do
the
hounds
were
drawing
near
no
escape
that
way
even
if
she
could
still
run
with
only
a
moment
hesitation
she
plunged
into
the
lake
and
struck
obliquely
across
her
tired
legs
could
not
propel
the
tired
body
rapidly
she
saw
the
boat
headed
for
her
she
turned
toward
the
centre
of
the
lake
the
boat
turned
she
could
hear
the
rattle
of
the
oarlocks
it
was
gaining
on
her
then
there
was
a
silence
then
there
was
a
splash
of
the
water
just
ahead
of
her
followed
by
a
roar
round
the
lake
the
words
it
all
and
a
rattle
of
the
oars
again
the
doe
saw
the
boat
nearing
her
she
turned
irresolutely
to
the
shore
whence
she
came
the
dogs
were
lapping
the
water
and
howling
there
she
turned
again
to
the
center
of
the
lake
the
brave
pretty
creature
was
quite
exhausted
now
in
a
moment
more
with
a
rush
of
water
the
boat
was
on
her
and
the
man
at
the
oars
had
leaned
over
and
caught
her
by
the
tail
her
on
the
head
with
that
paddle
he
shouted
to
the
gentleman
in
the
stern
the
gentleman
was
a
gentleman
with
a
kind
face
and
might
have
been
a
minister
of
some
sort
of
everlasting
gospel
he
took
the
paddle
in
his
hand
just
then
the
doe
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
him
with
her
great
appealing
eyes
ca
do
it
my
soul
i
ca
do
it
and
he
dropped
the
paddle
let
her
go
go
was
the
only
response
of
the
guide
as
he
slung
the
deer
round
whipped
out
his
and
made
a
pass
that
severed
her
jugular
and
the
gentleman
ate
that
night
of
the
venison
the
buck
returned
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
fawn
was
bleating
piteously
hungry
and
lonesome
the
buck
was
surprised
he
looked
about
in
the
forest
he
took
a
circuit
and
came
back
his
doe
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
looked
down
at
the
fawn
in
a
helpless
sort
of
way
the
fawn
appealed
for
his
supper
the
buck
had
nothing
whatever
to
give
his
child
nothing
but
his
sympathy
if
he
said
anything
this
is
what
he
said
the
head
of
this
family
but
really
this
is
a
novel
case
i
nothing
whatever
for
you
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
the
feelings
of
a
father
but
you
ca
live
on
them
let
us
the
buck
walked
away
the
little
one
toddled
after
him
they
disappeared
in
the
forest
a
character
study
there
has
been
a
lively
inquiry
after
the
primeval
man
wanted
a
man
who
would
satisfy
the
conditions
of
the
miocene
environment
and
yet
would
be
good
enough
for
an
ancestor
we
are
not
particular
about
our
ancestors
if
they
are
sufficiently
remote
but
we
must
have
something
failing
to
apprehend
the
primeval
man
science
has
sought
the
primitive
man
where
he
exists
as
a
survival
in
present
savage
races
he
is
at
best
only
a
mushroom
growth
of
the
recent
period
came
in
probably
with
the
general
raft
of
mammalian
fauna
but
he
possesses
yet
some
rudimentary
traits
that
may
be
studied
it
is
a
good
mental
exercise
to
try
to
fix
the
mind
on
the
primitive
man
divested
of
all
the
attributes
he
has
acquired
in
his
struggles
with
the
other
mammalian
fauna
fix
the
mind
on
an
orange
the
ordinary
occupation
of
the
metaphysician
take
from
it
without
eating
it
odor
color
weight
form
substance
and
peel
then
let
the
mind
still
dwell
on
it
as
an
orange
the
experiment
is
perfectly
successful
only
at
the
end
of
it
you
have
any
mind
better
still
consider
the
telephone
take
away
from
it
the
metallic
disk
and
the
magnetized
iron
and
the
connecting
wire
and
then
let
the
mind
run
abroad
on
the
telephone
the
mind
wo
come
back
i
have
tried
by
this
sort
of
process
to
get
a
conception
of
the
primitive
man
i
let
the
mind
roam
away
back
over
the
vast
geologic
spaces
and
sometimes
fancy
i
see
a
dim
image
of
him
stalking
across
the
terrace
epoch
of
the
quaternary
period
but
this
is
an
unsatisfying
pleasure
the
best
results
are
obtained
by
studying
the
primitive
man
as
he
is
left
here
and
there
in
our
era
a
witness
of
what
has
been
and
i
find
him
most
to
my
mind
in
the
adirondack
system
of
what
geologists
call
the
champlain
epoch
i
suppose
the
primitive
man
is
one
who
owes
more
to
nature
than
to
the
forces
of
civilization
what
we
seek
in
him
are
the
primal
and
original
traits
unmixed
with
the
sophistications
of
society
and
unimpaired
by
the
refinements
of
an
artificial
culture
he
would
retain
the
primitive
instincts
which
are
cultivated
out
of
the
ordinary
commonplace
man
i
should
expect
to
find
him
by
reason
of
an
unrelinquished
kinship
enjoying
a
special
communion
with
nature
admitted
to
its
mysteries
understanding
its
moods
and
able
to
predict
its
vagaries
he
would
be
a
kind
of
test
to
us
of
what
we
have
lost
by
our
gregarious
acquisitions
on
the
one
hand
there
would
be
the
sharpness
of
the
senses
the
keen
instincts
which
the
fox
and
the
beaver
still
possess
the
ability
to
find
one
way
in
the
pathless
forest
to
follow
a
trail
to
circumvent
the
wild
denizens
of
the
woods
and
on
the
other
hand
there
would
be
the
philosophy
of
life
which
the
primitive
man
with
little
external
aid
would
evolve
from
original
observation
and
cogitation
it
is
our
good
fortune
to
know
such
a
man
but
it
is
difficult
to
present
him
to
a
scientific
and
caviling
generation
he
emigrated
from
somewhat
limited
conditions
in
vermont
at
an
early
age
nearly
half
a
century
ago
and
sought
freedom
for
his
natural
development
backward
in
the
wilds
of
the
adirondacks
sometimes
it
is
a
love
of
adventure
and
freedom
that
sends
men
out
of
the
more
civilized
conditions
into
the
less
sometimes
it
is
a
constitutional
physical
lassitude
which
leads
them
to
prefer
the
rod
to
the
hoe
the
trap
to
the
sickle
and
the
society
of
bears
to
town
meetings
and
taxes
i
think
that
old
mountain
phelps
had
merely
the
instincts
of
the
primitive
man
and
never
any
hostile
civilizing
intent
as
to
the
wilderness
into
which
he
plunged
why
should
he
want
to
slash
away
the
forest
and
plow
up
the
ancient
mould
when
it
is
infinitely
pleasanter
to
roam
about
in
the
leafy
solitudes
or
sit
upon
a
mossy
log
and
listen
to
the
chatter
of
birds
and
the
stir
of
beasts
are
there
not
trout
in
the
streams
gum
exuding
from
the
spruce
sugar
in
the
maples
honey
in
the
hollow
trees
fur
on
the
sables
warmth
in
hickory
logs
will
not
a
few
days
planting
and
scratching
in
the
yield
potatoes
and
rye
and
if
there
is
steadier
diet
needed
than
venison
and
bear
is
the
pig
an
expensive
animal
if
old
phelps
bowed
to
the
prejudice
or
fashion
of
his
age
since
we
have
come
out
of
the
tertiary
state
of
things
and
reared
a
family
built
a
frame
house
in
a
secluded
nook
by
a
cold
spring
planted
about
it
some
apple
trees
and
a
rudimentary
garden
and
installed
a
group
of
flaming
sunflowers
by
the
door
i
am
convinced
that
it
was
a
concession
that
did
not
touch
his
radical
character
that
is
to
say
it
did
not
impair
his
reluctance
to
split
he
was
a
true
citizen
of
the
wilderness
thoreau
would
have
liked
him
as
he
liked
indians
and
woodchucks
and
the
smell
of
pine
forests
and
if
old
phelps
had
seen
thoreau
he
would
probably
have
said
to
him
on
airth
thoreau
do
you
live
accordin
to
your
preachin
you
might
be
misled
by
the
shaggy
suggestion
of
old
phelps
given
name
orson
into
the
notion
that
he
was
a
mighty
hunter
with
the
fierce
spirit
of
the
berserkers
in
his
veins
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
the
hirsute
and
grisly
sound
of
orson
expresses
only
his
entire
affinity
with
the
untamed
and
the
natural
an
uncouth
but
gentle
passion
for
the
freedom
and
wildness
of
the
forest
orson
phelps
has
only
those
unconventional
and
humorous
qualities
of
the
bear
which
make
the
animal
so
beloved
in
literature
and
one
does
not
think
of
old
phelps
so
much
as
a
lover
of
nature
to
use
the
sentimental
slang
of
the
period
as
a
part
of
nature
itself
his
appearance
at
the
time
when
as
a
he
began
to
come
into
public
notice
fostered
this
impression
a
sturdy
figure
with
long
body
and
short
legs
clad
in
a
woolen
shirt
and
trousers
repaired
to
the
point
of
picturesqueness
his
head
surmounted
by
a
limp
felt
hat
frayed
away
at
the
top
so
that
his
yellowish
hair
grew
out
of
it
like
some
nameless
fern
out
of
a
pot
his
tawny
hair
was
long
and
tangled
matted
now
many
years
past
the
possibility
of
being
entered
by
a
comb
his
features
were
small
and
delicate
and
set
in
the
frame
of
a
reddish
beard
the
razor
having
mowed
away
a
clearing
about
the
sensitive
mouth
which
was
not
seldom
wreathed
with
a
childlike
and
charming
smile
out
of
this
hirsute
environment
looked
the
small
gray
eyes
set
near
together
eyes
keen
to
observe
and
quick
to
express
change
of
thought
eyes
that
made
you
believe
instinct
can
grow
into
philosophic
judgment
his
feet
and
hands
were
of
aristocratic
smallness
although
the
latter
were
not
worn
away
by
ablutions
in
fact
they
assisted
his
toilet
to
give
you
the
impression
that
here
was
a
man
who
had
just
come
out
of
the
ground
a
real
son
of
the
soil
whose
appearance
was
partially
explained
by
his
humorous
relation
is
a
thing
he
said
i
hai
no
kinder
use
his
clothes
seemed
to
have
been
put
on
him
once
for
all
like
the
bark
of
a
tree
a
long
time
ago
the
observant
stranger
was
sure
to
be
puzzled
by
the
contrast
of
this
realistic
and
uncouth
exterior
with
the
internal
fineness
amounting
to
refinement
and
culture
that
shone
through
it
all
what
communion
had
supplied
the
place
of
our
artificial
breeding
to
this
man
perhaps
his
most
characteristic
attitude
was
sitting
on
a
log
with
a
short
pipe
in
his
mouth
if
ever
man
was
formed
to
sit
on
a
log
it
was
old
phelps
he
was
essentially
a
contemplative
person
walking
on
a
country
road
or
anywhere
in
the
was
irksome
to
him
he
had
a
shambling
gait
not
unlike
that
of
the
bear
his
short
legs
bowed
out
as
if
they
had
been
more
in
the
habit
of
climbing
trees
than
of
walking
on
land
if
we
may
use
that
expression
he
was
something
like
a
sailor
but
once
in
the
rugged
trail
or
the
unmarked
route
of
his
native
forest
he
was
a
different
person
and
few
pedestrians
could
compete
with
him
the
vulgar
estimate
of
his
contemporaries
that
reckoned
old
phelps
was
simply
a
failure
to
comprehend
the
conditions
of
his
being
it
is
the
unjustness
of
civilization
that
it
sets
up
uniform
and
artificial
standards
for
all
persons
the
primitive
man
suffers
by
them
much
as
the
contemplative
philosopher
does
when
one
happens
to
arrive
in
this
busy
fussy
world
if
the
appearance
of
old
phelps
attracts
attention
his
voice
when
first
heard
invariably
startles
the
listener
a
small
voice
it
easily
rises
into
the
shrillest
falsetto
and
it
has
a
quality
in
it
that
makes
it
audible
in
all
the
tempests
of
the
forest
or
the
roar
of
rapids
like
the
piping
of
a
boatswain
whistle
at
sea
in
a
gale
he
has
a
way
of
letting
it
rise
as
his
sentence
goes
on
or
when
he
is
opposed
in
argument
or
wishes
to
mount
above
other
voices
in
the
conversation
until
it
dominates
everything
heard
in
the
depths
of
the
woods
quavering
aloft
it
is
felt
to
be
as
much
a
part
of
nature
an
original
force
as
the
northwest
wind
or
the
scream
of
the
when
he
is
pottering
about
the
trying
to
light
his
pipe
with
a
twig
held
in
the
flame
he
is
apt
to
begin
some
philosophical
observation
in
a
small
slow
stumbling
voice
which
seems
about
to
end
in
defeat
when
he
puts
on
some
unsuspected
force
and
the
sentence
ends
in
an
insistent
shriek
horace
greeley
had
such
a
voice
and
could
regulate
it
in
the
same
manner
but
phelps
voice
is
not
seldom
plaintive
as
if
touched
by
the
dreamy
sadness
of
the
woods
themselves
when
old
mountain
phelps
was
discovered
he
was
as
the
reader
has
already
guessed
not
understood
by
his
contemporaries
his
neighbors
farmers
in
the
secluded
valley
had
many
of
them
grown
thrifty
and
prosperous
cultivating
the
fertile
meadows
and
vigorously
attacking
the
timbered
mountains
while
phelps
with
not
much
more
faculty
of
acquiring
property
than
the
roaming
deer
had
pursued
the
even
tenor
of
the
life
in
the
forest
on
which
he
set
out
they
would
have
been
surprised
to
be
told
that
old
phelps
owned
more
of
what
makes
the
value
of
the
adirondacks
than
all
of
them
put
together
but
it
was
true
this
woodsman
this
trapper
this
hunter
this
fisherman
this
sitter
on
a
log
and
philosopher
was
the
real
proprietor
of
the
region
over
which
he
was
ready
to
guide
the
stranger
it
is
true
that
he
had
not
a
monopoly
of
its
geography
or
its
topography
though
his
knowledge
was
superior
in
these
respects
there
were
other
trappers
and
more
deadly
hunters
and
as
intrepid
guides
but
old
phelps
was
the
discoverer
of
the
beauties
and
sublimities
of
the
mountains
and
when
city
strangers
broke
into
the
region
he
monopolized
the
appreciation
of
these
delights
and
wonders
of
nature
i
suppose
that
in
all
that
country
he
alone
had
noticed
the
sunsets
and
observed
the
delightful
processes
of
the
seasons
taken
pleasure
in
the
woods
for
themselves
and
climbed
mountains
solely
for
the
sake
of
the
prospect
he
alone
understood
what
was
meant
by
in
the
eyes
of
his
neighbors
who
did
not
know
that
he
was
a
poet
and
a
philosopher
i
dare
say
he
appeared
to
be
a
slack
provider
a
rather
shiftless
trapper
and
fisherman
and
his
passionate
love
of
the
forest
and
the
mountains
if
it
was
noticed
was
accounted
to
him
for
idleness
when
the
appreciative
tourist
arrived
phelps
was
ready
as
guide
to
open
to
him
all
the
wonders
of
his
possessions
he
for
the
first
time
found
an
outlet
for
his
enthusiasm
and
a
response
to
his
own
passion
it
then
became
known
what
manner
of
man
this
was
who
had
grown
up
here
in
the
companionship
of
forests
mountains
and
wild
animals
that
these
scenes
had
highly
developed
in
him
the
love
of
beauty
the
aesthetic
sense
delicacy
of
appreciation
refinement
of
feeling
and
that
in
his
solitary
wanderings
and
musings
the
primitive
man
had
evolved
for
himself
a
philosophy
and
a
system
of
things
and
it
was
a
sufficient
system
so
long
as
it
was
not
disturbed
by
external
skepticism
when
the
outer
world
came
to
him
perhaps
he
had
about
as
much
to
give
to
it
as
to
receive
from
it
probably
more
in
his
own
estimation
for
there
is
no
conceit
like
that
of
isolation
phelps
loved
his
mountains
he
was
the
discoverer
of
marcy
and
caused
the
first
trail
to
be
cut
to
its
summit
so
that
others
could
enjoy
the
noble
views
from
its
round
and
rocky
top
to
him
it
was
in
noble
symmetry
and
beauty
the
chief
mountain
of
the
globe
to
stand
on
it
gave
him
as
he
said
feeling
of
heaven
he
heard
with
impatience
that
mount
washington
was
a
thousand
feet
higher
and
he
had
a
childlike
incredulity
about
the
surpassing
sublimity
of
the
alps
praise
of
any
other
elevation
he
seemed
to
consider
a
slight
to
mount
marcy
and
did
not
willingly
hear
it
any
more
than
a
lover
hears
the
laudation
of
the
beauty
of
another
woman
than
the
one
he
loves
when
he
showed
us
scenery
he
loved
it
made
him
melancholy
to
have
us
speak
of
scenery
elsewhere
that
was
finer
and
yet
there
was
this
delicacy
about
him
that
he
never
what
he
brought
us
to
see
any
more
than
one
would
a
friend
of
whom
he
was
fond
i
remember
that
when
for
the
first
time
after
a
toilsome
journey
through
the
forest
the
splendors
of
the
lower
au
sable
pond
broke
upon
our
vision
that
silver
lake
imprisoned
by
the
precipices
which
it
reflected
in
its
bosom
he
made
no
outward
response
to
our
burst
of
admiration
only
a
quiet
gleam
of
the
eye
showed
the
pleasure
our
appreciation
gave
him
as
some
one
said
it
was
as
if
his
friend
had
been
admired
a
friend
about
whom
he
was
unwilling
to
say
much
himself
but
well
pleased
to
have
others
praise
thus
far
we
have
considered
old
phelps
as
simply
the
product
of
the
adirondacks
not
so
much
a
man
as
the
doubtful
phrase
has
it
as
a
natural
growth
amid
primal
forces
but
our
study
is
interrupted
by
another
influence
which
complicates
the
problem
but
increases
its
interest
no
scientific
observer
so
far
as
we
know
has
ever
been
able
to
watch
the
development
of
the
primitive
man
played
upon
and
fashioned
by
the
hebdomadal
iteration
of
weekly
old
phelps
educated
by
the
woods
is
a
fascinating
study
educated
by
the
woods
and
the
he
is
a
phenomenon
no
one
at
this
day
can
reasonably
conceive
exactly
what
this
newspaper
was
to
such
a
mountain
valley
as
keene
if
it
was
not
a
providence
it
was
a
bible
it
was
no
doubt
owing
to
it
that
democrats
became
as
scarce
as
moose
in
the
adirondacks
but
it
is
not
of
its
political
aspect
that
i
speak
i
suppose
that
the
most
cultivated
and
best
informed
portion
of
the
earth
surface
the
western
reserve
of
ohio
as
free
from
conceit
as
it
is
from
a
suspicion
that
it
lacks
anything
owes
its
solely
to
this
comprehensive
journal
it
received
from
it
everything
except
a
collegiate
and
a
classical
education
things
not
to
be
desired
since
they
interfere
with
the
of
man
if
greek
had
been
in
this
curriculum
its
best
known
dictum
would
have
been
translated
this
journal
carried
to
the
community
that
fed
on
it
not
only
a
complete
education
in
all
departments
of
human
practice
and
theorizing
but
the
more
valuable
and
satisfying
assurance
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
gleaned
in
the
universe
worth
the
attention
of
man
this
panoplied
its
readers
in
completeness
politics
literature
arts
sciences
universal
brotherhood
and
sisterhood
nothing
was
omitted
neither
the
poetry
of
tennyson
nor
the
philosophy
of
margaret
fuller
neither
the
virtues
of
association
nor
of
unbolted
wheat
the
laws
of
political
economy
and
trade
were
laid
down
as
positively
and
clearly
as
the
best
way
to
bake
beans
and
the
saving
truth
that
the
millennium
would
come
and
come
only
when
every
foot
of
the
earth
was
subsoiled
i
do
not
say
that
orson
phelps
was
the
product
of
nature
and
the
but
he
can
not
be
explained
without
considering
these
two
factors
to
him
greeley
was
the
and
the
was
greeley
and
yet
i
think
he
conceived
of
horace
greeley
as
something
greater
than
his
newspaper
and
perhaps
capable
of
producing
another
journal
equal
to
it
in
another
part
of
the
universe
at
any
rate
so
completely
did
phelps
absorb
this
paper
and
this
personality
that
he
was
popularly
known
as
in
the
region
where
he
lived
perhaps
a
fancied
resemblance
of
the
two
men
in
the
popular
mind
had
something
to
do
with
this
transfer
of
name
there
is
no
doubt
that
horace
greeley
owed
his
vast
influence
in
the
country
to
his
genius
nor
much
doubt
that
he
owed
his
popularity
in
the
rural
districts
to
james
gordon
bennett
that
is
to
the
personality
of
the
man
which
the
ingenious
bennett
impressed
upon
the
country
that
he
despised
the
conventionalities
of
society
and
was
a
sloven
in
his
toilet
was
firmly
believed
and
the
belief
endeared
him
to
the
hearts
of
the
people
to
them
old
white
an
antique
garment
of
unrenewed
immortality
was
as
much
a
subject
of
idolatry
as
the
redingote
grise
to
the
soldiers
of
the
first
napoleon
who
had
seen
it
by
the
campfires
on
the
po
and
on
the
borysthenes
and
believed
that
he
would
come
again
in
it
to
lead
them
against
the
enemies
of
france
the
greeley
of
the
popular
heart
was
clad
as
bennett
said
he
was
clad
it
was
in
vain
even
pathetically
in
vain
that
he
published
in
his
newspaper
the
full
bill
of
his
fashionable
tailor
the
fact
that
it
was
receipted
may
have
excited
the
animosity
of
some
of
his
contemporaries
to
show
that
he
wore
the
best
broadcloth
and
that
the
folds
of
his
trousers
followed
the
city
fashion
of
falling
outside
his
boots
if
this
revelation
was
believed
it
made
no
sort
of
impression
in
the
country
the
rural
readers
were
not
to
be
wheedled
out
of
their
cherished
conception
of
the
personal
appearance
of
the
philosopher
of
the
that
the
taught
old
phelps
to
be
more
phelps
than
he
would
have
been
without
it
was
part
of
the
mission
of
greeley
paper
the
subscribers
were
an
army
in
which
every
man
was
a
general
and
i
am
not
surprised
to
find
old
phelps
lately
rising
to
the
audacity
of
criticising
his
exemplar
in
some
observations
by
phelps
upon
the
philosophy
of
reading
is
laid
down
this
definition
i
understand
the
necessity
or
use
of
reading
it
is
to
reproduce
again
what
has
been
said
or
proclaimed
before
hence
letters
characters
are
arranged
in
all
the
perfection
they
possibly
can
be
to
show
how
certain
language
has
been
spoken
by
the
original
author
now
to
reproduce
by
reading
the
reading
should
be
so
perfectly
like
the
original
that
no
one
standing
out
of
sight
could
tell
the
reading
from
the
first
time
the
language
was
this
is
illustrated
by
the
highest
authority
at
hand
i
have
heard
as
good
readers
read
and
as
poor
readers
as
almost
any
one
in
this
region
if
i
have
not
heard
as
many
i
have
had
a
chance
to
hear
nearly
the
extreme
in
variety
horace
greeley
ought
to
have
been
a
good
reader
certainly
but
few
if
any
ever
knew
every
word
of
the
english
language
at
a
glance
more
readily
than
he
did
or
knew
the
meaning
of
every
mark
of
punctuation
more
clearly
but
he
could
not
read
proper
how
do
you
know
says
one
from
the
fact
i
heard
him
in
the
same
lecture
deliver
or
produce
remarks
in
his
own
particular
way
that
if
they
had
been
published
properly
in
print
a
proper
reader
would
have
reproduced
them
again
the
same
way
in
the
midst
of
those
remarks
greeley
took
up
a
paper
to
reproduce
by
reading
part
of
a
speech
that
some
one
else
had
made
and
his
reading
did
not
sound
much
more
like
the
man
that
first
read
or
made
the
speech
than
the
clatter
of
a
nail
factory
sounds
like
a
speech
now
the
fault
was
not
because
greeley
did
not
know
how
to
read
as
well
as
almost
any
man
that
ever
lived
if
not
quite
but
in
his
youth
he
learned
to
read
wrong
and
as
it
is
ten
times
harder
to
unlearn
anything
than
it
is
to
learn
it
he
like
thousands
of
others
could
never
stop
to
unlearn
it
but
carried
it
on
through
his
whole
life
whether
a
reader
would
be
thanked
for
reproducing
one
of
horace
greeley
lectures
as
he
delivered
it
is
a
question
that
can
not
detain
us
here
but
the
teaching
that
he
ought
to
do
so
i
think
would
please
greeley
the
first
driblets
of
professional
tourists
and
summer
boarders
who
arrived
among
the
adirondack
mountains
a
few
years
ago
found
old
phelps
the
chief
and
best
guide
of
the
region
those
who
were
eager
to
throw
off
the
usages
of
civilization
and
tramp
and
camp
in
the
wilderness
could
not
but
be
well
satisfied
with
the
aboriginal
appearance
of
this
guide
and
when
he
led
off
into
the
woods
axe
in
hand
and
a
huge
canvas
sack
upon
his
shoulders
they
seemed
to
be
following
the
wandering
jew
the
contents
of
this
sack
would
have
furnished
a
modern
industrial
exhibition
provisions
cooked
and
raw
blankets
tinware
clothing
pork
indian
meal
flour
coffee
tea
phelps
was
the
ideal
guide
he
knew
every
foot
of
the
pathless
forest
he
knew
all
woodcraft
all
the
signs
of
the
weather
or
what
is
the
same
thing
how
to
make
a
delphic
prediction
about
it
he
was
fisherman
and
hunter
and
had
been
the
comrade
of
sportsmen
and
explorers
and
his
enthusiasm
for
the
beauty
and
sublimity
of
the
region
and
for
its
untamable
wildness
amounted
to
a
passion
he
loved
his
profession
and
yet
it
very
soon
appeared
that
he
exercised
it
with
reluctance
for
those
who
had
neither
ideality
nor
love
for
the
woods
their
presence
was
a
profanation
amid
the
scenery
he
loved
to
guide
into
his
private
and
secret
haunts
a
party
that
had
no
appreciation
of
their
loveliness
disgusted
him
it
was
a
waste
of
his
time
to
conduct
flippant
young
men
and
giddy
girls
who
made
a
noisy
and
irreverent
lark
of
the
expedition
and
for
their
part
they
did
not
appreciate
the
benefit
of
being
accompanied
by
a
poet
and
a
philosopher
they
neither
understood
nor
valued
his
special
knowledge
and
his
shrewd
observations
they
did
even
like
his
shrill
voice
his
quaint
talk
bored
them
it
was
true
that
at
this
period
phelps
had
lost
something
of
the
activity
of
his
youth
and
the
habit
of
contemplative
sitting
on
a
log
and
talking
increased
with
the
infirmities
induced
by
the
hard
life
of
the
woodsman
perhaps
he
would
rather
talk
either
about
the
or
the
various
problems
of
existence
than
cut
wood
or
busy
himself
in
the
drudgery
of
the
camp
his
critics
went
so
far
as
to
say
phelps
is
a
they
would
have
said
the
same
of
socrates
xantippe
who
never
appreciated
the
world
in
which
socrates
lived
thought
he
was
lazy
probably
socrates
could
cook
no
better
than
old
phelps
and
no
doubt
went
about
athens
with
very
little
care
of
what
was
in
the
pot
for
dinner
if
the
summer
visitors
measured
old
phelps
he
also
measured
them
by
his
own
standards
he
used
to
write
out
what
he
called
of
his
comrades
in
the
woods
which
were
never
so
flattering
as
true
it
was
curious
to
see
how
the
various
qualities
which
are
esteemed
in
society
appeared
in
his
eyes
looked
at
merely
in
their
relation
to
the
limited
world
he
knew
and
judged
by
their
adaptation
to
the
primitive
life
it
was
a
much
subtler
comparison
than
that
of
the
ordinary
guide
who
rates
his
traveler
by
his
ability
to
endure
on
a
march
to
carry
a
pack
use
an
oar
hit
a
mark
or
sing
a
song
phelps
brought
his
people
to
a
test
of
their
naturalness
and
sincerity
tried
by
contact
with
the
verities
of
the
woods
if
a
person
failed
to
appreciate
the
woods
phelps
had
no
opinion
of
him
or
his
culture
and
yet
although
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
own
philosophy
of
life
worked
out
by
close
observation
of
nature
and
study
of
the
he
was
always
eager
for
converse
with
superior
minds
with
those
who
had
the
advantage
of
travel
and
much
reading
and
above
all
with
those
who
had
any
original
of
all
the
society
he
was
ever
permitted
to
enjoy
i
think
he
prized
most
that
of
bushnell
the
doctor
enjoyed
the
quaint
and
observations
of
the
old
woodsman
and
phelps
found
new
worlds
open
to
him
in
the
wide
ranges
of
the
doctor
mind
they
talked
by
the
hour
upon
all
sorts
of
themes
the
growth
of
the
tree
the
habits
of
wild
animals
the
migration
of
seeds
the
succession
of
oak
and
pine
not
to
mention
theology
and
the
mysteries
of
the
supernatural
i
recall
the
bearing
of
old
phelps
when
several
years
ago
he
conducted
a
party
to
the
summit
of
mount
marcy
by
the
way
he
had
this
was
his
mountain
and
he
had
a
peculiar
sense
of
ownership
in
it
in
a
way
it
was
holy
ground
and
he
would
rather
no
one
should
go
on
it
who
did
not
feel
its
sanctity
perhaps
it
was
a
sense
of
some
divine
relation
in
it
that
made
him
always
speak
of
it
as
to
him
this
ridiculously
dubbed
mount
marcy
was
always
by
a
like
effort
to
soften
the
personal
offensiveness
of
the
nomenclature
of
this
region
he
invariably
spoke
of
dix
peak
one
of
the
southern
peaks
of
the
range
as
it
was
some
time
since
phelps
himself
had
visited
his
mountain
and
as
he
pushed
on
through
the
miles
of
forest
we
noticed
a
kind
of
eagerness
in
the
old
man
as
of
a
lover
going
to
a
rendezvous
along
the
foot
of
the
mountain
flows
a
clear
trout
stream
secluded
and
undisturbed
in
those
awful
solitudes
which
is
the
of
the
old
woodsman
that
day
when
he
crossed
it
in
advance
of
his
company
he
was
heard
to
say
in
a
low
voice
as
if
greeting
some
object
of
which
he
was
shyly
fond
little
brook
do
i
meet
you
once
more
and
when
we
were
well
up
the
mountain
and
emerged
from
the
last
stunted
fringe
of
vegetation
upon
the
slope
i
saw
old
phelps
who
was
still
foremost
cast
himself
upon
the
ground
and
heard
him
cry
with
an
enthusiasm
that
was
intended
for
no
mortal
ear
with
you
once
again
his
great
passion
very
rarely
found
expression
in
any
such
theatrical
burst
the
bare
summit
that
day
was
swept
by
a
fierce
cold
wind
and
lost
in
an
occasional
chilling
cloud
some
of
the
party
exhausted
by
the
climb
and
shivering
in
the
rude
wind
wanted
a
fire
kindled
and
a
cup
of
tea
made
and
thought
this
the
guide
business
fire
and
tea
were
far
enough
from
his
thought
he
had
withdrawn
himself
quite
apart
and
wrapped
in
a
ragged
blanket
still
and
silent
as
the
rock
he
stood
on
was
gazing
out
upon
the
wilderness
of
peaks
the
view
from
marcy
is
peculiar
it
is
without
softness
or
relief
the
narrow
valleys
are
only
dark
shadows
the
lakes
are
bits
of
broken
mirror
from
horizon
to
horizon
there
is
a
tumultuous
sea
of
billows
turned
to
stone
you
stand
upon
the
highest
billow
you
command
the
situation
you
have
surprised
nature
in
a
high
creative
act
the
mighty
primal
energy
has
only
just
become
repose
this
was
a
supreme
hour
to
old
phelps
tea
i
believe
the
boys
succeeded
in
kindling
a
fire
but
the
enthusiastic
stoic
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
want
of
appreciation
in
the
rest
of
the
party
when
we
were
descending
he
told
us
with
mingled
humor
and
scorn
of
a
party
of
ladies
he
once
led
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
on
a
still
day
who
began
immediately
to
talk
about
the
fashions
as
he
related
the
scene
stopping
and
facing
us
in
the
trail
his
mild
eyes
came
to
the
front
and
his
voice
rose
with
his
language
to
a
kind
of
scream
there
they
were
right
before
the
greatest
view
they
ever
saw
talkin
about
the
fashions
impossible
to
convey
the
accent
of
contempt
in
which
he
pronounced
the
word
and
then
added
with
a
sort
of
regretful
bitterness
was
a
great
mind
to
come
down
and
leave
in
common
with
the
greeks
old
phelps
personified
the
woods
mountains
and
streams
they
had
not
only
personality
but
distinctions
of
sex
it
was
something
beyond
the
characterization
of
the
hunter
which
appeared
for
instance
when
he
related
a
fight
with
a
panther
in
such
expressions
as
panther
thought
he
would
see
what
he
could
do
etc
he
was
in
with
all
wild
things
the
afternoon
we
descended
marcy
we
went
away
to
the
west
through
the
primeval
forests
toward
avalanche
and
colden
and
followed
the
course
of
the
charming
opalescent
when
we
reached
the
leaping
stream
phelps
exclaimed
little
miss
opalescent
do
you
say
opalescent
some
one
asked
she
too
pretty
and
too
pretty
she
was
with
her
and
rainbow
dress
and
her
downfalls
and
fountainlike
uprising
a
bewitching
young
person
we
found
her
all
that
summer
afternoon
this
person
had
little
in
common
with
a
monstrous
lady
whose
adventures
in
the
wilderness
phelps
was
fond
of
relating
she
was
built
some
thing
on
the
plan
of
the
mountains
and
her
ambition
to
explore
was
equal
to
her
size
phelps
and
the
other
guides
once
succeeded
in
raising
her
to
the
top
of
marcy
but
the
feat
of
getting
a
hogshead
of
molasses
up
there
would
have
been
easier
in
attempting
to
give
us
an
idea
of
her
magnitude
that
night
as
we
sat
in
the
forest
camp
phelps
hesitated
a
moment
while
he
cast
his
eye
around
the
woods
there
ai
no
tree
it
is
only
by
recalling
fragmentary
remarks
and
incidents
that
i
can
put
the
reader
in
possession
of
the
peculiarities
of
my
subject
and
this
involves
the
wrenching
of
things
out
of
their
natural
order
and
continuity
and
introducing
them
abruptly
an
abruptness
illustrated
by
the
remark
of
man
which
phelps
liked
to
quote
when
one
day
he
suddenly
slipped
down
a
bank
into
a
thicket
and
seated
himself
in
a
wasps
nest
hai
no
business
here
but
here
i
be
the
first
time
we
went
into
camp
on
the
upper
au
sable
pond
which
has
been
justly
celebrated
as
the
most
prettily
set
sheet
of
water
in
the
region
we
were
disposed
to
build
our
shanty
on
the
south
side
so
that
we
could
have
in
full
view
the
gothics
and
that
loveliest
of
mountain
contours
to
our
surprise
old
phelps
whose
sentimental
weakness
for
these
mountains
we
knew
opposed
this
his
favorite
camping
ground
was
on
the
north
side
a
pretty
site
in
itself
but
with
no
special
view
in
order
to
enjoy
the
lovely
mountains
we
should
be
obliged
to
row
out
into
the
lake
we
wanted
them
always
before
our
eyes
at
sunrise
and
sunset
and
in
the
blaze
of
noon
with
deliberate
speech
as
if
weighing
our
arguments
and
disposing
of
them
he
replied
now
them
gothics
ai
the
kinder
scenery
you
want
ter
hog
down
it
was
on
quiet
sundays
in
the
woods
or
in
talks
by
the
that
phelps
came
out
as
the
philosopher
and
commonly
contributed
the
light
of
his
observations
unfortunate
marriages
and
marriages
in
general
were
on
one
occasion
the
subject
of
discussion
and
a
good
deal
of
darkness
had
been
cast
on
it
by
various
speakers
when
phelps
suddenly
piped
up
from
a
log
where
he
had
sat
silent
almost
invisible
in
the
shadow
and
smoke
now
when
you
said
all
there
is
to
be
said
marriage
is
mostly
for
discipline
certainly
the
old
man
had
in
one
way
or
another
and
years
of
solitary
communing
in
the
forest
had
given
him
perhaps
a
childlike
insight
into
spiritual
concerns
whether
he
had
formulated
any
creed
or
what
faith
he
had
i
never
knew
keene
valley
had
a
reputation
of
not
ripening
christians
any
more
successfully
than
maize
the
season
there
being
short
and
on
our
first
visit
it
was
said
to
contain
but
one
bible
christian
though
i
think
an
accurate
census
disclosed
three
old
phelps
who
sometimes
made
abrupt
remarks
in
trying
situations
was
not
included
in
this
census
but
he
was
the
disciple
of
supernaturalism
in
a
most
charming
form
i
have
heard
of
his
opening
his
inmost
thoughts
to
a
lady
one
sunday
after
a
noble
sermon
of
robertson
had
been
read
in
the
cathedral
stillness
of
the
forest
his
experience
was
entirely
and
related
with
unconsciousness
that
it
was
not
common
to
all
there
was
nothing
of
the
mystic
or
the
sentimentalist
only
a
vivid
realism
in
that
nearness
of
god
of
which
he
spoke
near
as
those
trees
and
of
the
holy
voice
that
in
a
time
of
inward
struggle
had
seemed
to
him
to
come
from
the
depths
of
the
forest
saying
soul
i
am
the
in
later
years
there
was
a
in
keene
valley
the
result
of
which
was
a
number
of
young
whom
phelps
seemed
to
regard
as
a
veteran
might
raw
recruits
and
to
have
his
doubts
what
sort
of
soldiers
they
would
make
jimmy
he
said
to
one
of
them
kindled
a
pretty
good
fire
with
light
wood
that
what
we
do
of
a
dark
night
in
the
woods
you
know
but
we
do
it
just
so
as
we
can
look
around
and
find
the
solid
wood
so
now
put
on
your
solid
in
the
sunday
bible
classes
of
the
period
phelps
was
a
perpetual
anxiety
to
the
others
who
followed
closely
the
printed
lessons
and
beheld
with
alarm
his
discursive
efforts
to
get
into
freer
air
and
light
his
remarks
were
the
most
refreshing
part
of
the
exercises
but
were
outside
of
the
safe
path
into
which
the
others
thought
it
necessary
to
win
him
from
his
the
class
were
one
day
on
the
verses
concerning
being
on
the
heart
and
were
keeping
close
to
the
shore
under
the
guidance
of
notes
when
old
phelps
made
a
dive
to
the
bottom
and
remarked
that
he
had
a
good
deal
about
the
expression
word
written
on
the
heart
and
had
been
asking
himself
how
that
was
to
be
done
and
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
having
been
much
interested
lately
in
watching
the
work
of
a
photographer
that
when
a
photograph
is
going
to
be
taken
all
that
has
to
be
done
is
to
put
the
object
in
position
and
the
sun
makes
the
picture
and
so
he
rather
thought
that
all
we
had
got
to
do
was
to
put
our
hearts
in
place
and
god
would
do
the
phelps
theology
like
his
science
is
in
the
woods
one
day
talk
ran
on
the
trinity
as
being
nowhere
asserted
as
a
doctrine
in
the
bible
and
some
one
suggested
that
the
attempt
to
pack
these
great
and
fluent
mysteries
into
one
word
must
always
be
more
or
less
unsatisfactory
droned
phelps
never
could
see
much
speckerlation
in
that
expression
the
trinity
why
they
a
good
deal
better
say
the
sentiment
of
the
man
about
nature
or
his
poetic
sensibility
was
frequently
not
to
be
distinguished
from
a
natural
religion
and
was
always
tinged
with
the
devoutness
of
wordsworth
verse
climbing
slowly
one
day
up
the
balcony
he
was
more
than
usually
calm
and
slow
he
espied
an
exquisite
fragile
flower
in
the
crevice
of
a
rock
in
a
very
lonely
spot
seems
as
if
he
said
or
rather
dreamed
out
seems
as
if
the
creator
had
kept
something
just
to
look
at
to
a
lady
whom
he
had
taken
to
chapel
pond
a
retired
but
rather
uninteresting
spot
and
who
expressed
a
little
disappointment
at
its
tameness
saying
of
this
phelps
the
principal
charm
of
this
place
seems
to
be
its
he
replied
in
gentle
and
lingering
tones
and
its
nativeness
lies
here
just
where
it
was
rest
and
quiet
had
infinite
attractions
for
him
a
secluded
opening
in
the
woods
was
a
he
told
of
seeing
once
or
rather
being
in
a
circular
rainbow
he
stood
on
indian
head
overlooking
the
lower
lake
so
that
he
saw
the
whole
bow
in
the
sky
and
the
lake
and
seemed
to
be
in
the
midst
of
it
at
one
place
there
was
an
indentation
in
it
where
it
rested
on
the
lake
just
enough
to
keep
it
from
rolling
this
of
the
sphere
seemed
to
give
him
great
comfort
one
morning
in
october
some
ladies
found
the
old
man
sitting
on
his
doorstep
smoking
a
short
pipe
he
gave
no
sign
of
recognition
except
a
twinkle
of
the
eye
being
evidently
quite
in
harmony
with
the
peaceful
day
they
stood
there
a
full
minute
before
he
opened
his
mouth
then
he
did
not
rise
but
slowly
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
said
in
a
dreamy
way
pointing
towards
the
brook
you
see
that
tree
indicating
a
maple
almost
denuded
of
leaves
which
lay
like
a
yellow
garment
cast
at
its
feet
been
watching
that
tree
all
the
morning
there
hai
been
a
breath
of
wind
but
for
hours
the
leaves
have
been
falling
falling
just
as
you
see
them
now
and
at
last
it
pretty
much
and
after
a
pause
pensively
i
suppose
its
hour
had
this
contemplative
habit
of
old
phelps
is
wholly
unappreciated
by
his
neighbors
but
it
has
been
indulged
in
no
inconsiderable
part
of
his
life
rising
after
a
time
he
said
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
and
see
my
golden
city
i
talked
so
much
he
led
the
way
to
a
when
suddenly
emerging
from
the
forest
the
spectators
saw
revealed
the
winding
valley
and
its
stream
he
said
quietly
is
my
golden
far
below
at
their
feet
they
saw
that
vast
assemblage
of
birches
and
yellow
as
gold
in
the
brooding
noonday
and
slender
spires
rising
out
of
the
glowing
mass
without
another
word
phelps
sat
a
long
time
in
silent
content
it
was
to
him
as
bunyan
says
place
desirous
to
be
is
this
philosopher
contented
with
what
life
has
brought
him
speaking
of
money
one
day
when
we
had
asked
him
if
he
should
do
differently
if
he
had
his
life
to
live
over
again
he
said
but
not
about
money
to
have
had
hours
such
as
i
have
had
in
these
mountains
and
with
such
men
as
bushnell
and
shaw
and
twichell
and
others
i
could
name
is
worth
all
the
money
the
world
could
he
read
character
very
well
and
took
in
accurately
the
boy
nature
an
irrepressible
rather
overdone
specimen
a
nice
kind
of
a
boy
but
he
got
to
come
up
against
a
one
of
these
he
once
said
ca
git
boys
to
take
any
kinder
notice
of
scenery
i
never
yet
saw
a
boy
that
would
look
a
second
time
at
a
sunset
now
a
girl
will
some
times
but
even
then
instantaneous
comes
an
goes
like
the
sunset
as
for
me
still
speaking
of
scenery
mountains
about
here
that
i
see
every
day
are
no
more
to
me
in
one
sense
than
a
man
farm
is
to
him
what
mostly
interests
me
now
is
when
i
see
some
new
freak
or
shape
in
the
face
of
in
literature
it
may
be
said
that
old
phelps
prefers
the
best
in
the
very
limited
range
that
has
been
open
to
him
tennyson
is
his
favorite
among
poets
an
affinity
explained
by
the
fact
that
they
are
both
speaking
of
a
talk
of
beecher
which
he
had
read
he
said
filled
my
cup
about
as
full
as
i
callerlate
to
have
it
there
was
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
it
and
some
poetry
waal
and
a
little
spice
too
we
got
to
have
the
spice
you
he
admired
for
different
reasons
a
lecture
by
greeley
that
he
once
heard
into
which
so
much
knowledge
of
various
kinds
was
crowded
that
he
said
he
a
gobble
of
he
was
not
without
discrimination
which
he
exercised
upon
the
local
preaching
when
nothing
better
offered
of
one
sermon
he
said
man
began
way
back
at
the
creation
and
just
preached
right
along
down
and
he
did
say
nothing
after
all
it
just
seemed
to
me
as
if
he
was
tryin
to
git
up
a
kind
of
a
old
phelps
used
words
sometimes
like
algebraic
signs
and
had
a
habit
of
making
one
do
duty
for
a
season
together
for
all
occasions
and
and
are
specimens
of
words
that
were
prolific
in
expression
an
unusual
expression
or
an
unusual
article
would
be
charactcrized
as
a
of
a
scientific
literary
is
the
program
for
tomorrow
i
once
asked
him
i
callerlate
if
they
rig
up
the
callerlation
they
callerlate
on
go
to
the
starting
out
for
a
day
tramp
in
the
woods
he
would
ask
whether
we
wanted
to
take
a
walk
or
a
random
scoot
the
latter
being
a
plunge
into
the
pathless
forest
when
he
was
on
such
an
expedition
and
became
entangled
in
dense
brush
and
maybe
a
network
of
and
swamp
he
was
like
an
old
wizard
as
he
looked
here
and
there
seeking
a
way
peering
into
the
tangle
or
withdrawing
from
a
thicket
and
muttering
to
himself
ai
no
speckerlation
and
when
the
way
became
altogether
inscrutable
this
is
a
random
scoot
of
a
as
some
one
remarked
dictionary
in
his
hands
is
like
clay
in
the
hands
of
the
petrifaction
was
a
kind
of
a
chemical
there
is
no
conceit
we
are
apt
to
say
like
that
born
of
isolation
from
the
world
and
there
are
no
such
conceited
people
as
those
who
have
lived
all
their
lives
in
the
woods
phelps
was
however
unsophisticated
in
his
until
the
advent
of
strangers
into
his
life
who
brought
in
literature
and
various
other
disturbing
influences
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
effect
has
been
to
take
off
something
of
the
bloom
of
his
simplicity
and
to
elevate
him
into
an
oracle
i
suppose
this
is
inevitable
as
soon
as
one
goes
into
print
and
phelps
has
gone
into
print
in
the
local
papers
he
has
been
bitten
with
the
literary
justly
regarding
most
of
the
adirondack
literature
as
a
fizzle
he
has
himself
projected
a
work
and
written
much
on
the
natural
history
of
his
region
long
ago
he
made
a
large
map
of
the
mountain
country
and
until
recent
surveys
it
was
the
only
one
that
could
lay
any
claim
to
accuracy
his
history
is
no
doubt
original
in
form
and
unconventional
in
expression
like
most
of
the
writers
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
court
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
eighteenth
century
he
is
an
independent
speller
writing
of
his
work
on
the
adirondacks
he
says
i
should
ever
live
to
get
this
wonderful
thing
written
i
expect
it
will
show
one
thing
if
no
more
and
that
is
that
every
thing
has
an
opposite
i
expect
to
show
in
this
that
literature
has
an
opposite
if
i
do
not
show
any
thing
els
we
could
not
enjoy
the
blessings
and
happiness
of
riteousness
if
we
did
not
know
innicuty
was
in
the
world
in
fact
there
would
be
no
riteousness
without
writing
also
of
his
great
enjoyment
of
being
in
the
woods
especially
since
he
has
had
the
society
there
of
some
people
he
names
he
adds
since
i
have
literature
siance
and
art
all
spread
about
on
the
green
moss
of
the
mountain
woods
or
the
gravell
banks
of
a
cristle
stream
it
seems
like
finding
roses
honeysuckels
and
violets
on
a
crisp
brown
cliff
in
december
you
know
i
do
believe
much
in
the
religion
of
seramony
but
any
riteous
thing
that
has
life
and
spirit
in
it
is
food
for
i
must
not
neglect
to
mention
an
essay
continued
in
several
numbers
of
his
local
paper
on
growth
of
the
tree
in
which
he
demolishes
the
theory
of
greeley
whom
he
calls
of
the
best
vegetable
philosophers
about
without
he
treats
of
the
office
of
sap
trees
have
some
kind
of
sap
and
some
kind
of
operation
of
sap
flowing
in
their
season
the
dissemination
of
seeds
the
processes
of
growth
the
power
of
healing
wounds
the
proportion
of
roots
to
branches
speaking
of
the
latter
he
says
have
thought
it
would
be
one
of
the
greatest
curiosities
on
earth
to
see
a
thrifty
growing
maple
or
elm
that
had
grown
on
a
deep
soil
interval
to
be
two
feet
in
diameter
to
be
raised
clear
into
the
air
with
every
root
and
fibre
down
to
the
minutest
thread
all
entirely
cleared
of
soil
so
that
every
particle
could
be
seen
in
its
natural
position
i
think
it
would
astonish
even
the
wise
from
his
instinctive
sympathy
with
nature
he
often
credits
vegetable
organism
with
teaches
us
that
a
tree
is
given
powerful
instincts
which
would
almost
appear
to
amount
to
judgment
in
some
cases
to
provide
for
its
own
wants
and
here
our
study
must
cease
when
the
primitive
man
comes
into
literature
he
is
no
longer
primitive
vi
camping
out
it
seems
to
be
agreed
that
civilization
is
kept
up
only
by
a
constant
effort
nature
claims
its
own
speedily
when
the
effort
is
relaxed
if
you
clear
a
patch
of
fertile
ground
in
the
forest
uproot
the
stumps
and
plant
it
year
after
year
in
potatoes
and
maize
you
say
you
have
subdued
it
but
if
you
leave
it
for
a
season
or
two
a
kind
of
barbarism
seems
to
steal
out
upon
it
from
the
circling
woods
coarse
grass
and
brambles
cover
it
bushes
spring
up
in
a
wild
tangle
the
raspberry
and
the
blackberry
flower
and
fruit
and
the
humorous
bear
feeds
upon
them
the
last
state
of
that
ground
is
worse
than
the
first
perhaps
the
cleared
spot
is
called
ephesus
there
is
a
splendid
city
on
the
plain
there
are
temples
and
theatres
on
the
hills
the
commerce
of
the
world
seeks
its
port
the
luxury
of
the
orient
flows
through
its
marble
streets
you
are
there
one
day
when
the
sea
has
receded
the
plain
is
a
pestilent
marsh
the
temples
the
theatres
the
lofty
gates
have
sunken
and
crumbled
and
the
runs
over
them
and
as
you
grow
pensive
in
the
most
desolate
place
in
the
world
a
bandit
lounges
out
of
a
tomb
and
offers
to
relieve
you
of
all
that
which
creates
artificial
distinctions
in
society
the
higher
the
civilization
has
risen
the
more
abject
is
the
desolation
of
barbarism
that
ensues
the
most
melancholy
spot
in
the
adirondacks
is
not
a
where
the
traveler
wades
in
moss
and
mire
and
the
atmosphere
is
composed
of
equal
active
parts
of
mosquitoes
and
midges
it
is
the
village
of
the
adirondack
where
the
streets
of
gaunt
houses
are
falling
to
pieces
tenantless
the
have
stopped
the
furnaces
are
in
ruins
the
iron
and
wooden
machinery
is
strewn
about
in
helpless
detachment
and
heaps
of
charcoal
ore
and
slag
proclaim
an
arrested
industry
beside
this
deserted
village
even
calamity
pond
shallow
sedgy
with
its
ragged
shores
of
stunted
firs
and
its
melancholy
shaft
that
marks
the
spot
where
the
proprietor
of
the
accidentally
shot
himself
is
cheerful
the
instinct
of
barbarism
that
leads
people
periodically
to
throw
aside
the
habits
of
civilization
and
seek
the
freedom
and
discomfort
of
the
woods
is
explicable
enough
but
it
is
not
so
easy
to
understand
why
this
passion
should
be
strongest
in
those
who
are
most
refined
and
most
trained
in
intellectual
and
social
fastidiousness
philistinism
and
shoddy
do
not
like
the
woods
unless
it
becomes
fashionable
to
do
so
and
then
as
speedily
as
possible
they
introduce
their
artificial
luxuries
and
reduce
the
life
in
the
wilderness
to
the
vulgarity
of
a
picnic
it
is
they
who
have
strewn
the
adirondacks
with
paper
collars
and
tin
cans
the
real
enjoyment
of
camping
and
tramping
in
the
woods
lies
in
a
return
to
primitive
conditions
of
lodging
dress
and
food
in
as
total
an
escape
as
may
be
from
the
requirements
of
civilization
and
it
remains
to
be
explained
why
this
is
enjoyed
most
by
those
who
are
most
highly
civilized
it
is
wonderful
to
see
how
easily
the
restraints
of
society
fall
off
of
course
it
is
not
true
that
courtesy
depends
upon
clothes
with
the
best
people
but
with
others
behavior
hangs
almost
entirely
upon
dress
many
good
habits
are
easily
got
rid
of
in
the
woods
doubt
sometimes
seems
to
be
felt
whether
sunday
is
a
legal
holiday
there
it
becomes
a
question
of
casuistry
with
a
clergyman
whether
he
may
shoot
at
a
mark
on
sunday
if
none
of
his
congregation
are
present
he
intends
no
harm
he
only
gratifies
a
curiosity
to
see
if
he
can
hit
the
mark
where
shall
he
draw
the
line
doubtless
he
might
throw
a
stone
at
a
chipmunk
or
shout
at
a
loon
might
he
fire
at
a
mark
with
an
that
makes
no
noise
he
will
not
fish
or
hunt
on
sunday
although
he
is
no
more
likely
to
catch
anything
that
day
than
on
any
other
but
may
he
eat
trout
that
the
guide
has
caught
on
sunday
if
the
guide
swears
he
caught
them
saturday
night
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
vacation
in
religion
how
much
of
our
virtue
do
we
owe
to
inherited
habits
i
am
not
at
all
sure
whether
this
desire
to
camp
outside
of
civilization
is
creditable
to
human
nature
or
otherwise
we
hear
sometimes
that
the
turk
has
been
merely
camping
for
four
centuries
in
europe
i
suspect
that
many
of
us
are
after
all
really
camping
temporarily
in
civilized
conditions
and
that
going
into
the
wilderness
is
an
escape
longed
for
into
our
natural
and
preferred
state
consider
what
this
is
that
is
confessedly
so
agreeable
to
people
most
delicately
reared
i
have
no
desire
to
exaggerate
its
delights
the
adirondack
wilderness
is
essentially
unbroken
a
few
bad
roads
that
penetrate
it
a
few
jolting
wagons
that
traverse
them
a
few
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
where
the
boarders
are
soothed
by
patent
coffee
and
stimulated
to
unnatural
gayety
by
japan
tea
and
experimented
on
by
unique
cookery
do
little
to
destroy
the
savage
fascination
of
the
region
in
half
an
hour
at
any
point
one
can
put
himself
into
solitude
and
every
desirable
discomfort
the
party
that
covets
the
experience
of
the
camp
comes
down
to
primitive
conditions
of
dress
and
equipment
there
are
guides
and
porters
to
carry
the
blankets
for
beds
the
raw
provisions
and
the
camp
equipage
and
the
motley
party
of
the
temporarily
decivilized
files
into
the
woods
and
begins
perhaps
by
a
road
perhaps
on
a
trail
its
exhilarating
and
weary
march
the
exhilaration
arises
partly
from
the
casting
aside
of
restraint
partly
from
the
adventure
of
exploration
and
the
weariness
from
the
interminable
toil
of
bad
walking
a
heavy
pack
and
the
grim
monotony
of
trees
and
bushes
that
shut
out
all
prospect
except
an
occasional
glimpse
of
the
sky
mountains
are
painfully
climbed
streams
forded
lonesome
lakes
paddled
over
long
and
muddy
traversed
fancy
this
party
the
victim
of
political
exile
banished
by
the
law
and
a
more
sorrowful
march
could
not
be
imagined
but
the
voluntary
hardship
becomes
pleasure
and
it
is
undeniable
that
the
spirits
of
the
party
rise
as
the
difficulties
increase
for
this
straggling
and
stumbling
band
the
world
is
young
again
it
has
come
to
the
beginning
of
things
it
has
cut
loose
from
tradition
and
is
free
to
make
a
home
anywhere
the
movement
has
all
the
promise
of
a
revolution
all
this
virginal
freshness
invites
the
primitive
instincts
of
play
and
disorder
the
free
range
of
the
forests
suggests
endless
possibilities
of
exploration
and
possession
perhaps
we
are
treading
where
man
since
the
creation
never
trod
before
perhaps
the
waters
of
this
bubbling
spring
which
we
deepen
by
scraping
out
the
decayed
leaves
and
the
black
earth
have
never
been
tasted
before
except
by
the
wild
denizens
of
these
woods
we
cross
the
trails
of
lurking
animals
paths
that
heighten
our
sense
of
seclusion
from
the
world
the
hammering
of
the
infrequent
woodpecker
the
call
of
the
lonely
bird
the
drumming
of
the
solitary
partridge
all
these
sounds
do
but
emphasize
the
lonesomeness
of
nature
the
roar
of
the
mountain
brook
dashing
over
its
bed
of
pebbles
rising
out
of
the
ravine
and
spreading
as
it
were
a
mist
of
sound
through
all
the
forest
continuous
beating
waves
that
have
the
rhythm
of
eternity
in
them
and
the
fitful
movement
of
the
through
the
balsams
and
firs
and
the
giant
pines
how
these
grand
symphonies
shut
out
the
little
exasperations
of
our
vexed
life
it
seems
easy
to
begin
life
over
again
on
the
simplest
terms
probably
it
is
not
so
much
the
desire
of
the
congregation
to
escape
from
the
preacher
or
of
the
preacher
to
escape
from
himself
that
drives
sophisticated
people
into
the
wilderness
as
it
is
the
unconquered
craving
for
primitive
simplicity
the
revolt
against
the
everlasting
of
our
civilization
from
this
monstrous
pomposity
even
the
artificial
rusticity
of
a
petit
trianon
is
a
relief
it
was
only
human
nature
that
the
jaded
frenchman
of
the
regency
should
run
away
to
the
new
world
and
live
in
a
with
an
indian
squaw
although
he
found
little
satisfaction
in
his
act
of
heroism
unless
it
was
talked
about
at
versailles
when
our
trampers
come
late
in
the
afternoon
to
the
bank
of
a
lovely
lake
where
they
purpose
to
enter
the
primitive
life
everything
is
waiting
for
them
in
virgin
expectation
there
is
a
little
promontory
jutting
into
the
lake
and
sloping
down
to
a
sandy
beach
on
which
the
waters
idly
lapse
and
shoals
of
and
shiners
come
to
greet
the
stranger
the
forest
is
untouched
by
the
axe
the
tender
green
sweeps
the
water
edge
ranks
of
slender
firs
are
marshaled
by
the
shore
clumps
of
stems
shine
in
satin
purity
among
the
evergreens
the
boles
of
giant
spruces
maples
and
oaks
lifting
high
their
crowns
of
foliage
stretch
away
in
endless
galleries
and
arcades
through
the
shifting
leaves
the
sunshine
falls
upon
the
brown
earth
overhead
are
fragments
of
blue
sky
under
the
boughs
and
in
chance
openings
appear
the
bluer
lake
and
the
outline
of
the
gracious
mountains
the
discoverers
of
this
paradise
which
they
have
entered
to
destroy
note
the
babbling
of
the
brook
that
flows
close
at
hand
they
hear
the
splash
of
the
leaping
fish
they
listen
to
the
sweet
metallic
song
of
the
evening
thrush
and
the
chatter
of
the
red
squirrel
who
angrily
challenges
their
right
to
be
there
but
the
moment
of
sentiment
passes
this
party
has
come
here
to
eat
and
to
sleep
and
not
to
encourage
nature
in
her
poetic
attitudinizing
the
spot
for
a
shanty
is
selected
this
side
shall
be
its
opening
towards
the
lake
and
in
front
of
it
the
fire
so
that
the
smoke
shall
drift
into
the
hut
and
discourage
the
mosquitoes
yonder
shall
be
the
cook
fire
and
the
path
to
the
spring
the
whole
colony
bestir
themselves
in
the
foundation
of
a
new
home
an
enterprise
that
has
all
the
fascination
and
none
of
the
danger
of
a
veritable
new
settlement
in
the
wilderness
the
axes
of
the
guides
resound
in
the
echoing
spaces
great
trunks
fall
with
a
crash
vistas
are
opened
towards
the
lake
and
the
mountains
the
spot
for
the
shanty
is
cleared
of
underbrush
forked
stakes
are
driven
into
the
ground
are
laid
on
them
and
poles
sloping
back
to
the
ground
in
an
incredible
space
of
time
there
is
the
skeleton
of
a
house
which
is
entirely
open
in
front
the
roof
and
sides
must
be
covered
for
this
purpose
the
trunks
of
great
spruces
are
skinned
the
woodman
rims
the
bark
near
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
again
six
feet
above
and
slashes
it
perpendicularly
then
with
a
blunt
stick
he
crowds
off
this
thick
hide
exactly
as
an
ox
is
skinned
it
needs
but
a
few
of
these
skins
to
cover
the
roof
and
they
make
a
perfectly
roof
except
when
it
rains
meantime
busy
hands
have
gathered
boughs
of
the
spruce
and
the
feathery
balsam
and
shingled
the
ground
underneath
the
shanty
for
a
bed
it
is
an
aromatic
bed
in
theory
it
is
elastic
and
consoling
upon
it
are
spread
the
blankets
the
sleepers
of
all
sexes
and
ages
are
to
lie
there
in
a
row
their
feet
to
the
fire
and
their
heads
under
the
edge
of
the
sloping
roof
nothing
could
be
better
contrived
the
fire
is
in
front
it
is
not
a
fire
but
a
conflagration
a
vast
heap
of
green
logs
set
on
fire
of
pitch
and
split
and
crackling
balsams
raging
and
roaring
by
the
time
twilight
falls
the
cook
has
prepared
supper
everything
has
been
cooked
in
a
tin
pail
and
a
skillet
potatoes
tea
pork
mutton
slapjacks
you
wonder
how
everything
could
have
been
prepared
in
so
few
utensils
when
you
eat
the
wonder
ceases
everything
might
have
been
cooked
in
one
pail
it
is
a
noble
meal
and
nobly
is
it
disposed
of
by
these
amateur
savages
sitting
about
upon
logs
and
roots
of
trees
never
were
there
such
potatoes
never
beans
that
seemed
to
have
more
of
the
bean
in
them
never
such
curly
pork
never
trout
with
more
on
them
never
mutton
more
distinctly
sheepy
and
the
tea
drunk
out
of
a
tin
cup
with
a
lump
of
dissolved
in
it
it
is
the
sort
of
tea
that
takes
hold
lifts
the
hair
and
disposes
the
drinker
to
anecdote
and
hilariousness
there
is
no
deception
about
it
it
tastes
of
tannin
and
spruce
and
creosote
everything
in
short
has
the
flavor
of
the
wilderness
and
a
free
life
it
is
idyllic
and
yet
with
all
our
sentimentality
there
is
nothing
feeble
about
the
cooking
the
slapjacks
are
a
solid
job
of
work
made
to
last
and
not
go
to
pieces
in
a
person
stomach
like
a
trivial
bun
we
might
record
on
them
in
cuneiform
characters
our
incipient
civilization
and
future
generations
would
doubtless
turn
them
up
as
acadian
bricks
good
robust
victuals
are
what
the
primitive
man
wants
darkness
falls
suddenly
outside
the
ring
of
light
from
our
conflagration
the
woods
are
black
there
is
a
tremendous
impression
of
isolation
and
lonesomeness
in
our
situation
we
are
the
prisoners
of
the
night
the
woods
never
seemed
so
vast
and
mysterious
the
trees
are
gigantic
there
are
noises
that
we
do
not
understand
mysterious
winds
passing
overhead
and
rambling
in
the
great
galleries
grinding
against
each
other
undefinable
stirs
and
uneasinesses
the
shapes
of
those
who
pass
into
the
dimness
are
outlined
in
monstrous
proportions
the
spectres
seated
about
in
the
glare
of
the
fire
talk
about
appearances
and
presentiments
and
religion
the
guides
cheer
the
night
with
and
catamount
encounters
and
experiences
and
simple
tales
of
great
prolixity
and
no
point
and
jokes
of
primitive
lucidity
we
hear
catamounts
and
the
stealthy
tread
of
things
in
the
leaves
and
the
hooting
of
owls
and
when
the
moon
rises
the
laughter
of
the
loon
everything
is
strange
spectral
fascinating
by
and
by
we
get
our
positions
in
the
shanty
for
the
night
and
arrange
the
row
of
sleepers
the
shanty
has
become
a
by
this
time
waves
of
smoke
roll
into
it
from
the
fire
it
is
only
by
lying
down
and
getting
the
head
well
under
the
eaves
that
one
can
breathe
no
one
can
find
her
nobody
has
a
pillow
at
length
the
row
is
laid
out
with
the
solemn
protestation
of
intention
to
sleep
the
wind
shifting
drives
away
the
smoke
is
said
a
hundred
times
positions
are
readjusted
more
last
words
new
shifting
about
final
remarks
it
is
all
so
comfortable
and
romantic
and
then
silence
silence
continues
for
a
minute
the
fire
flashes
up
all
the
row
of
heads
is
lifted
up
simultaneously
to
watch
it
showers
of
sparks
sail
aloft
into
the
blue
night
the
vast
vault
of
greenery
is
a
fairy
spectacle
how
the
sparks
mount
and
twinkle
and
disappear
like
tropical
fireflies
and
all
the
leaves
murmur
and
clap
their
hands
some
of
the
sparks
do
not
go
out
we
see
them
flaming
in
the
sky
when
the
flame
of
the
fire
has
died
down
well
goodnight
more
folding
of
the
arms
to
sleep
more
grumbling
about
the
hardness
of
a
or
the
insufficiency
of
a
for
a
pillow
was
that
a
remark
something
about
a
root
a
stub
in
the
ground
sticking
into
the
back
could
lie
along
a
hair
no
here
another
stub
it
needs
but
a
moment
for
the
conversation
to
become
general
about
roots
under
the
shoulder
stubs
in
the
back
a
ridge
on
which
it
is
impossible
for
the
sleeper
to
balance
the
of
boughs
the
hardness
of
the
ground
the
heat
the
smoke
the
chilly
air
subjects
of
remarks
multiply
the
whole
camp
is
awake
and
chattering
like
an
aviary
the
owl
is
also
awake
but
the
guides
who
are
asleep
outside
make
more
noise
than
the
owls
water
is
wanted
and
is
handed
about
in
a
dipper
everybody
is
yawning
everybody
is
now
determined
to
go
to
sleep
in
good
earnest
a
last
there
is
an
appalling
silence
it
is
interrupted
in
the
most
natural
way
in
the
world
somebody
has
got
the
start
and
gone
to
sleep
he
proclaims
the
fact
he
seems
to
have
been
brought
up
on
the
seashore
and
to
know
how
to
make
all
the
noises
of
the
restless
ocean
he
is
also
like
a
or
it
is
suggested
like
a
how
malignantly
he
snorts
and
breaks
off
short
and
at
once
begins
again
in
another
key
one
head
is
raised
after
another
is
that
punch
him
with
the
sleeper
is
turned
over
the
turn
was
a
mistake
he
was
before
it
appears
on
his
most
agreeable
side
the
camp
rises
in
indignation
the
sleeper
sits
up
in
bewilderment
before
he
can
go
off
again
two
or
three
others
have
preceded
him
they
are
all
alike
you
never
can
judge
what
a
person
is
when
he
is
awake
there
are
here
half
a
dozen
disturbers
of
the
peace
who
should
be
put
in
solitary
confinement
at
midnight
when
a
philosopher
crawls
out
to
sit
on
a
log
by
the
fire
and
smoke
a
pipe
a
duet
in
tenor
and
is
going
on
in
the
shanty
with
a
chorus
always
coming
in
at
the
wrong
time
those
who
are
not
asleep
want
to
know
why
the
smoker
does
go
to
bed
he
is
requested
to
get
some
water
to
throw
on
another
log
to
see
what
time
it
is
to
note
whether
it
looks
like
rain
a
buzz
of
conversation
arises
she
is
sure
she
heard
something
behind
the
shanty
he
says
it
is
all
nonsense
however
it
might
be
a
are
there
mice
that
what
i
heard
nibbling
by
my
head
i
sha
sleep
a
wink
do
they
bite
they
nibble
scarcely
ever
take
a
full
bite
horrid
towards
morning
it
grows
chilly
the
guides
have
let
the
fire
go
out
the
blankets
will
slip
down
anxiety
begins
to
be
expressed
about
the
dawn
time
does
the
sun
rise
early
did
you
sleep
a
wink
and
you
spots
i
going
to
dig
up
this
root
as
soon
as
it
is
light
that
mist
on
the
lake
and
the
light
just
coming
on
the
gothics
i
no
idea
it
was
so
cold
all
the
first
part
of
the
night
i
was
were
they
talking
about
all
night
when
the
party
crawls
out
to
the
early
breakfast
after
it
has
washed
its
faces
in
the
lake
it
is
disorganized
but
cheerful
nobody
admits
much
sleep
but
everybody
is
refreshed
and
declares
it
delightful
it
is
the
fresh
air
all
night
that
invigorates
or
maybe
it
is
the
tea
or
the
the
guides
have
erected
a
table
of
spruce
bark
with
benches
at
the
sides
so
that
breakfast
is
taken
in
form
it
is
served
on
tin
plates
and
oak
chips
after
breakfast
begins
the
day
work
it
may
be
a
expedition
or
rowing
and
angling
in
the
lake
or
fishing
for
trout
in
some
stream
two
or
three
miles
distant
nobody
can
stir
far
from
camp
without
a
guide
hammocks
are
swung
bowers
are
built
begins
worsted
work
appears
cards
are
shuffled
and
dealt
the
day
passes
in
absolute
freedom
from
responsibility
to
one
self
at
night
when
the
expeditions
return
the
camp
resumes
its
animation
adventures
are
recounted
every
statement
of
the
narrator
being
disputed
and
argued
everybody
has
become
an
adept
in
woodcraft
but
nobody
credits
his
neighbor
with
like
instinct
society
getting
resolved
into
its
elements
confidence
is
gone
whilst
the
hilarious
party
are
at
supper
a
drop
or
two
of
rain
falls
the
head
guide
is
appealed
to
is
it
going
to
rain
he
says
it
does
rain
but
will
it
be
a
rainy
night
the
guide
goes
down
to
the
lake
looks
at
the
sky
and
concludes
that
if
the
wind
shifts
a
more
there
is
no
telling
what
sort
of
weather
we
shall
have
meantime
the
drops
patter
thicker
on
the
leaves
overhead
and
the
leaves
in
turn
pass
the
water
down
to
the
table
the
sky
darkens
the
wind
rises
there
is
a
kind
of
shiver
in
the
woods
and
we
scud
away
into
the
shanty
taking
the
remains
of
our
supper
and
eating
it
as
best
we
can
the
rain
increases
the
fire
sputters
and
fumes
all
the
trees
are
dripping
dripping
and
the
ground
is
wet
we
can
not
step
outdoors
without
getting
a
drenching
like
sheep
we
are
penned
in
the
little
hut
where
no
one
can
stand
erect
the
rain
swirls
into
the
open
front
and
wets
the
bottom
of
the
blankets
the
smoke
drives
in
we
curl
up
and
enjoy
ourselves
the
guides
at
length
conclude
that
it
is
going
to
be
damp
the
dismal
situation
sets
us
all
into
good
spirits
and
it
is
later
than
the
night
before
when
we
crawl
under
our
blankets
sure
this
time
of
a
sound
sleep
lulled
by
the
storm
and
the
rain
resounding
on
the
bark
roof
how
much
better
off
we
are
than
many
a
wretch
we
are
as
snug
as
dry
herrings
at
the
moment
however
of
dropping
off
to
sleep
somebody
unfortunately
notes
a
drop
of
water
on
his
face
this
is
followed
by
another
drop
in
an
instant
a
stream
is
established
he
moves
his
head
to
a
dry
place
scarcely
has
he
done
so
when
he
feels
a
dampness
in
his
back
reaching
his
hand
outside
he
finds
a
puddle
of
water
soaking
through
his
blanket
by
this
time
somebody
inquires
if
it
is
possible
that
the
roof
leaks
one
man
has
a
stream
of
water
under
him
another
says
it
is
coming
into
his
ear
the
roof
appears
to
be
a
discriminating
sieve
those
who
are
dry
see
no
need
of
such
a
fuss
the
man
in
the
corner
spreads
his
umbrella
and
the
protective
measure
is
resented
by
his
neighbor
in
the
darkness
there
is
recrimination
one
of
the
guides
who
is
summoned
suggests
that
the
rubber
blankets
be
passed
out
and
spread
over
the
roof
the
inmates
dislike
the
proposal
saying
that
a
is
no
worse
than
a
the
rain
continues
to
soak
down
the
fire
is
only
half
alive
the
bedding
is
damp
some
sit
up
if
they
can
find
a
dry
spot
to
sit
on
and
smoke
heartless
observations
are
made
a
few
sleep
and
the
night
wears
on
the
morning
opens
cheerless
the
sky
is
still
leaking
and
so
is
the
shanty
the
guides
bring
in
a
breakfast
the
roof
is
patched
up
there
are
reviving
signs
of
breaking
away
delusive
signs
that
create
momentary
exhilaration
even
if
the
storm
clears
the
woods
are
soaked
there
is
no
chance
of
stirring
the
world
is
only
ten
feet
square
this
life
without
responsibility
or
clean
clothes
may
continue
as
long
as
the
reader
desires
there
are
those
who
would
like
to
live
in
this
free
fashion
forever
taking
rain
and
sun
as
heaven
pleases
and
there
are
some
souls
so
constituted
that
they
can
not
exist
more
than
three
days
without
their
worldly
baggage
taking
the
party
altogether
from
one
cause
or
another
it
is
likely
to
strike
camp
sooner
than
was
intended
and
the
stricken
camp
is
a
melancholy
sight
the
woods
have
been
despoiled
the
stumps
are
ugly
the
bushes
are
scorched
the
earth
is
trodden
into
mire
the
landing
looks
like
a
the
ground
is
littered
with
all
the
unsightly
dibris
of
a
life
the
dismantled
shanty
is
a
shabby
object
the
charred
and
blackened
logs
where
the
fire
blazed
suggest
the
extinction
of
family
life
man
has
wrought
his
usual
wrong
upon
nature
and
he
can
save
his
only
by
moving
to
virgin
forests
and
move
to
them
he
will
the
next
season
if
not
this
for
he
who
has
once
experienced
the
fascination
of
the
never
escapes
its
enticement
in
the
memory
nothing
remains
but
its
charm
vii
a
wilderness
romance
at
the
south
end
of
keene
valley
in
the
adirondacks
stands
noon
mark
a
shapely
peak
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
which
with
the
aid
of
the
sun
tells
the
keene
people
when
it
is
time
to
eat
dinner
from
its
summit
you
look
south
into
a
vast
wilderness
basin
a
great
stretch
of
forest
little
trodden
and
out
of
whose
bosom
you
can
hear
from
the
heights
on
a
still
day
the
loud
murmur
of
the
boquet
this
basin
of
unbroken
green
rises
away
to
the
south
and
southeast
into
the
rocky
heights
of
dix
peak
and
nipple
top
the
latter
a
local
name
which
neither
the
mountain
nor
the
fastidious
tourist
is
able
to
shake
off
indeed
so
long
as
the
mountain
keeps
its
present
shape
as
seen
from
the
southern
lowlands
it
can
not
get
on
without
this
name
these
two
mountains
which
belong
to
the
great
system
of
which
marcy
is
the
giant
centre
and
are
in
the
neighborhood
of
five
thousand
feet
high
on
the
southern
outposts
of
the
great
mountains
form
the
of
the
pass
into
the
south
country
this
opening
between
them
is
called
hunter
pass
it
is
the
most
elevated
and
one
of
the
wildest
of
the
mountain
passes
its
summit
is
hundred
feet
high
in
former
years
it
is
presumed
the
hunters
occasionally
followed
the
game
through
but
latterly
it
is
rare
to
find
a
guide
who
has
been
that
way
and
the
and
tourists
have
not
yet
made
it
a
runway
this
seclusion
is
due
not
to
any
inherent
difficulty
of
travel
but
to
the
fact
that
it
lies
a
little
out
of
the
way
we
went
through
it
last
summer
making
our
way
into
the
jaws
from
the
foot
of
the
great
slides
on
dix
keeping
along
the
ragged
spurs
of
the
mountain
through
the
virgin
forest
the
pass
is
narrow
walled
in
on
each
side
by
precipices
of
granite
and
blocked
up
with
bowlders
and
fallen
trees
and
beset
with
pitfalls
in
the
roads
ingeniously
covered
with
moss
when
the
climber
occasionally
loses
sight
of
a
leg
in
one
of
these
treacherous
holes
and
feels
a
cold
sensation
in
his
foot
he
learns
that
he
has
dipped
into
the
sources
of
the
boquet
which
emerges
lower
down
into
falls
and
rapids
and
recruited
by
creeping
tributaries
goes
brawling
through
the
forest
basin
and
at
last
comes
out
an
amiable
and
stream
in
the
valley
of
elizabeth
town
from
the
summit
another
rivulet
trickles
away
to
the
south
and
finds
its
way
through
a
frightful
tamarack
swamp
and
through
woods
scarred
by
ruthless
lumbering
to
mud
pond
a
quiet
body
of
water
with
a
ghastly
fringe
of
dead
trees
upon
which
people
of
grand
intentions
and
weak
vocabulary
are
trying
to
fix
the
name
of
elk
lake
the
descent
of
the
pass
on
that
side
is
precipitous
and
exciting
the
way
is
in
the
stream
itself
and
a
considerable
portion
of
the
distance
we
swung
ourselves
down
the
faces
of
considerable
falls
and
tumbled
down
cascades
the
descent
however
was
made
easy
by
the
fact
that
it
rained
and
every
footstep
was
yielding
and
slippery
why
sane
people
often
respectably
connected
will
subject
themselves
to
this
sort
of
treatment
be
wet
to
the
skin
bruised
by
the
rocks
and
flung
about
among
the
bushes
and
dead
wood
until
the
most
necessary
part
of
their
apparel
hangs
in
shreds
is
one
of
the
delightful
mysteries
of
these
woods
i
suspect
that
every
man
is
at
heart
a
roving
animal
and
likes
at
intervals
to
revert
to
the
condition
of
the
bear
and
the
catamount
there
is
no
trail
through
hunter
pass
which
as
i
have
intimated
is
the
least
frequented
portion
of
this
wilderness
yet
we
were
surprised
to
find
a
path
a
considerable
portion
of
the
way
and
wherever
a
path
is
possible
it
was
not
a
mere
deer
runway
these
are
found
everywhere
in
the
mountains
it
is
trodden
by
other
and
larger
animals
and
is
no
doubt
the
highway
of
beasts
it
bears
marks
of
having
been
so
for
a
long
period
and
probably
a
period
long
ago
large
animals
are
not
common
in
these
woods
now
and
you
seldom
meet
anything
fiercer
than
the
timid
deer
and
the
gentle
bear
but
in
days
gone
by
hunter
pass
was
the
highway
of
the
whole
caravan
of
animals
who
were
continually
going
backward
and
forwards
in
the
aimless
roaming
way
that
beasts
have
between
mud
pond
and
the
boquet
basin
i
think
i
can
see
now
the
procession
of
them
between
the
heights
of
dix
and
nipple
top
the
elk
and
the
moose
shambling
along
cropping
the
twigs
the
heavy
bear
lounging
by
with
his
exploring
nose
the
frightened
deer
trembling
at
every
twig
that
snapped
beneath
his
little
hoofs
intent
on
the
of
the
pond
the
raccoon
and
the
hedgehog
sidling
along
and
the
panther
insouciant
and
conscienceless
scenting
the
path
with
a
curious
glow
in
his
eye
or
crouching
in
an
overhanging
tree
ready
to
drop
into
the
procession
at
the
right
moment
night
and
day
year
after
year
i
see
them
going
by
watched
by
the
red
fox
and
the
comfortably
clad
sable
and
grinned
at
by
the
black
cat
the
innocent
the
vicious
the
timid
and
the
savage
the
shy
and
the
bold
the
chattering
slanderer
and
the
screaming
prowler
the
industrious
and
the
peaceful
the
critic
and
the
crawling
biter
just
as
it
is
elsewhere
it
makes
me
blush
for
my
species
when
i
think
of
it
this
charming
society
is
nearly
extinct
now
of
the
larger
animals
there
only
remain
the
bear
who
minds
his
own
business
more
thoroughly
than
any
person
i
know
and
the
deer
who
would
like
to
be
friendly
with
men
but
whose
winning
face
and
gentle
ways
are
no
protection
from
the
savageness
of
man
and
who
is
treated
with
the
same
unpitying
destruction
as
the
snarling
catamount
i
have
read
in
history
that
the
amiable
natives
of
hispaniola
fared
no
better
at
the
hands
of
the
brutal
spaniards
than
the
fierce
and
warlike
caribs
as
society
is
at
present
constituted
in
christian
countries
i
would
rather
for
my
own
security
be
a
cougar
than
a
fawn
there
is
not
much
of
romantic
interest
in
the
adirondacks
out
of
the
books
of
daring
travelers
nothing
i
do
not
know
that
the
keene
valley
has
any
history
the
mountains
always
stood
here
and
the
au
sable
flowing
now
in
shallows
and
now
in
rippling
reaches
over
the
sands
and
pebbles
has
for
ages
filled
the
air
with
continuous
and
soothing
sounds
before
the
vermonters
broke
into
it
some
of
a
century
ago
and
made
meadows
of
its
bottoms
and
of
its
fringing
woods
i
suppose
the
red
indian
lived
here
in
his
usual
discomfort
and
was
as
restless
as
his
successors
the
summer
boarders
but
the
streams
were
full
of
trout
then
and
the
moose
and
the
elk
left
their
broad
tracks
on
the
sands
of
the
river
but
of
the
indian
there
is
no
trace
there
is
a
mound
in
the
valley
much
like
a
tel
in
the
country
of
bashan
beyond
the
jordan
that
may
have
been
built
by
some
race
and
may
contain
treasure
and
the
seated
figure
of
a
preserved
chieftain
on
his
slow
way
to
paradise
what
the
gentle
and
accomplished
race
of
the
should
want
in
this
savage
region
where
the
frost
kills
the
early
potatoes
and
stunts
the
scanty
oats
i
do
not
know
i
have
seen
no
trace
of
them
except
this
tel
and
one
other
slight
relic
which
came
to
light
last
summer
and
is
not
enough
to
found
the
history
of
a
race
upon
some
workingmen
getting
stone
from
the
hillside
on
one
of
the
little
plateaus
for
a
discovered
partly
embedded
a
piece
of
pottery
unique
in
this
region
with
the
unerring
instinct
of
workmen
in
regard
to
antiquities
they
thrust
a
crowbar
through
it
and
broke
the
bowl
into
several
pieces
the
joint
fragments
however
give
us
the
form
of
the
dish
it
is
a
bowl
about
nine
inches
high
and
eight
inches
across
made
of
red
clay
baked
but
not
glazed
the
bottom
is
round
the
top
flares
into
four
comers
and
the
rim
is
rudely
but
rather
artistically
ornamented
with
scratches
made
when
the
clay
was
soft
the
vessel
is
made
of
clay
not
found
about
here
and
it
is
one
that
the
indians
formerly
living
here
could
not
form
was
it
brought
here
by
roving
indians
who
may
have
made
an
expedition
to
the
ohio
was
it
passed
from
tribe
to
tribe
or
did
it
belong
to
a
race
that
occupied
the
country
before
the
indian
and
who
have
left
traces
of
their
civilized
skill
in
pottery
scattered
all
over
the
continent
if
i
could
establish
the
fact
that
this
jar
was
made
by
a
prehistoric
race
we
should
then
have
four
generations
in
this
lovely
valley
amiable
people
whose
gentle
descendants
were
probably
killed
by
the
spaniards
in
the
west
indies
the
red
indians
the
keene
flaters
from
vermont
and
the
summer
boarders
to
say
nothing
of
the
various
races
of
animals
who
have
been
unable
to
live
here
since
the
advent
of
the
summer
boarders
the
valley
being
not
productive
enough
to
sustain
both
this
last
incursion
has
been
more
destructive
to
the
noble
serenity
of
the
forest
than
all
the
preceding
but
we
are
wandering
from
hunter
pass
the
western
walls
of
it
are
formed
by
the
precipices
of
nipple
top
not
so
striking
nor
so
bare
as
the
great
slides
of
dix
which
glisten
in
the
sun
like
silver
but
rough
and
repelling
and
consequently
alluring
i
have
a
great
desire
to
scale
them
i
have
always
had
an
unreasonable
wish
to
explore
the
rough
summit
of
this
crabbed
hill
which
is
too
broken
and
jagged
for
pleasure
and
not
high
enough
for
glory
this
desire
was
stimulated
by
a
legend
related
by
our
guide
that
night
in
the
mud
pond
cabin
the
guide
had
never
been
through
the
pass
before
although
he
was
familiar
with
the
region
and
had
ascended
nipple
top
in
the
winter
in
pursuit
of
the
sable
the
story
he
told
does
amount
to
much
none
of
the
stories
do
faithfully
reported
and
i
should
not
have
believed
it
if
i
had
not
had
a
good
deal
of
leisure
on
my
hands
at
the
time
and
been
of
a
willing
mind
and
i
may
say
in
rather
of
a
starved
condition
as
to
any
romance
in
this
region
the
guide
said
then
and
he
mentioned
it
casually
in
reply
to
our
inquiries
about
ascending
the
mountain
that
there
was
a
cave
high
up
among
the
precipices
on
the
southeast
side
of
nipple
top
he
scarcely
volunteered
the
information
and
with
seeming
reluctance
gave
us
any
particulars
about
it
i
always
admire
this
art
by
which
the
accomplished
lets
his
listener
drag
the
reluctant
tale
of
the
marvelous
from
him
and
makes
you
in
a
manner
responsible
for
its
improbability
if
this
is
well
managed
the
listener
is
always
eager
to
believe
a
great
deal
more
than
the
romancer
seems
willing
to
tell
and
always
resents
the
assumed
reservations
and
doubts
of
the
latter
there
were
strange
reports
about
this
cave
when
the
old
guide
was
a
boy
and
even
then
its
very
existence
had
become
legendary
nobody
knew
exactly
where
it
was
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
had
been
inhabited
hunters
in
the
forests
south
of
dix
had
seen
a
light
late
at
night
twinkling
through
the
trees
high
up
the
mountain
and
now
and
then
a
ruddy
glare
as
from
the
of
a
furnace
settlers
were
few
in
the
wilderness
then
and
all
the
inhabitants
were
well
known
if
the
cave
was
inhabited
it
must
be
by
strangers
and
by
men
who
had
some
secret
purpose
in
seeking
this
seclusion
and
eluding
observation
if
suspicious
characters
were
seen
about
port
henry
or
if
any
such
landed
from
the
steamers
on
the
shore
of
lake
champlain
it
was
impossible
to
identify
them
with
these
invaders
who
were
never
seen
their
not
being
seen
did
not
however
prevent
the
growth
of
the
belief
in
their
existence
little
indications
and
rumors
each
trivial
in
itself
became
a
mass
of
testimony
that
could
not
be
disposed
of
because
of
its
very
indefiniteness
but
which
appealed
strongly
to
man
noblest
faculty
his
imagination
or
credulity
the
cave
existed
and
it
was
inhabited
by
men
who
came
and
went
on
mysterious
errands
and
transacted
their
business
by
night
what
this
band
of
adventurers
or
desperadoes
lived
on
how
they
conveyed
their
food
through
the
trackless
woods
to
their
high
eyrie
and
what
could
induce
men
to
seek
such
a
retreat
were
questions
discussed
but
never
settled
they
might
be
banditti
but
there
was
nothing
to
plunder
in
these
savage
wilds
and
in
fact
robberies
and
raids
either
in
the
settlements
of
the
hills
or
the
distant
lake
shore
were
unknown
in
another
age
these
might
have
been
hermits
holy
men
who
had
retired
from
the
world
to
feed
the
vanity
of
their
godliness
in
a
spot
where
they
were
subject
neither
to
interruption
nor
comparison
they
would
have
had
a
shrine
in
the
cave
and
an
image
of
the
blessed
virgin
with
a
lamp
always
burning
before
it
and
sending
out
its
mellow
light
over
the
savage
waste
a
more
probable
notion
was
that
they
were
romantic
frenchmen
who
had
grow
weary
of
vice
and
refinement
together
possibly
princes
expectants
of
the
throne
bourbon
remainders
named
williams
or
otherwise
unhatched
eggs
so
to
speak
of
kings
who
had
withdrawn
out
of
observation
to
wait
for
the
next
in
paris
frenchmen
do
such
things
if
they
were
not
frenchmen
they
might
be
or
criminals
escaped
from
justice
or
from
the
friendly
of
new
york
this
last
supposition
was
however
more
violent
than
the
others
or
seems
so
to
us
in
this
day
of
grace
for
what
new
york
criminal
would
be
so
insane
as
to
run
away
from
his
political
friends
the
keepers
from
the
easily
had
companionship
of
his
pals
outside
and
from
the
society
of
his
criminal
lawyer
and
in
short
to
put
himself
into
the
depths
of
a
wilderness
out
of
which
escape
when
escape
was
desired
is
a
good
deal
more
difficult
than
it
is
out
of
the
swarming
jails
of
the
empire
state
besides
how
foolish
for
a
man
if
he
were
a
really
hardened
and
professional
criminal
having
established
connections
and
a
regular
business
to
run
away
from
the
pardon
which
might
have
difficulty
in
finding
him
in
the
craggy
bosom
of
nipple
top
this
gang
of
men
there
is
some
doubt
whether
they
were
accompanied
by
women
gave
little
evidence
in
their
appearance
of
being
escaped
criminals
or
expectant
kings
their
movements
were
mysterious
but
not
necessarily
violent
if
their
occupation
could
have
been
discovered
that
would
have
furnished
a
clew
to
their
true
character
but
about
this
the
strangers
were
as
close
as
mice
if
anything
could
betray
them
it
was
the
steady
light
from
the
cavern
and
its
occasional
ruddy
flashing
this
gave
rise
to
the
opinion
which
was
strengthened
by
a
good
many
indications
equally
conclusive
that
the
cave
was
the
resort
of
a
gang
of
coiners
and
counterfeiters
here
they
had
their
furnace
and
dies
here
they
manufactured
those
spurious
quarters
and
halves
that
their
confidants
who
were
pardoned
were
circulating
and
which
a
few
honest
men
were
to
the
this
prosaic
explanation
of
a
romantic
situation
satisfies
all
the
requirements
of
the
known
facts
but
the
lively
imagination
at
once
rejects
it
as
unworthy
of
the
subject
i
think
the
guide
put
it
forward
in
order
to
have
it
rejected
the
fact
is
at
least
it
has
never
been
disproved
these
strangers
whose
movements
were
veiled
belonged
to
that
dark
and
mysterious
race
whose
presence
anywhere
on
this
continent
is
a
of
romance
or
of
terror
they
were
spaniards
you
need
not
say
buccaneers
you
need
not
say
you
need
not
say
swarthy
adventurers
even
it
is
enough
to
say
spaniards
there
is
no
tale
of
mystery
and
fanaticism
and
daring
i
would
not
believe
if
a
spaniard
is
the
hero
of
it
and
it
is
not
necessary
either
that
he
should
have
the
name
of
bodadilla
or
ojeda
nobody
i
suppose
would
doubt
this
story
if
the
moose
quaffing
deep
draughts
of
red
wine
from
silver
tankards
and
then
throwing
themselves
back
upon
divans
and
lazily
puffing
the
fragrant
havana
after
a
day
of
toil
what
more
natural
and
what
more
probable
for
a
spaniard
does
the
reader
think
these
inferences
not
warranted
by
the
facts
he
does
not
know
the
facts
it
is
true
that
our
guide
had
never
himself
personally
visited
the
cave
but
he
has
always
intended
to
hunt
it
up
his
information
in
regard
to
it
comes
from
his
father
who
was
a
mighty
hunter
and
trapper
in
one
of
his
expeditions
over
nipple
top
he
chanced
upon
the
cave
the
mouth
was
half
concealed
by
undergrowth
he
entered
not
without
some
apprehension
engendered
by
the
legends
which
make
it
famous
i
think
he
showed
some
boldness
in
venturing
into
such
a
place
alone
i
confess
that
before
i
went
in
i
should
want
to
fire
a
gatling
gun
into
the
mouth
for
a
little
while
in
order
to
rout
out
the
bears
which
usually
dwell
there
he
went
in
however
the
entrance
was
low
but
the
cave
was
spacious
not
large
but
big
enough
with
a
level
floor
and
a
vaulted
ceiling
it
had
long
been
deserted
but
that
it
was
once
the
residence
of
highly
civilized
beings
there
could
be
no
doubt
the
dead
brands
in
the
centre
were
the
remains
of
a
fire
that
could
not
have
been
kindled
by
wild
beasts
and
the
bones
scattered
about
had
been
scientifically
dissected
and
handled
there
were
also
remnants
of
furniture
and
pieces
of
garments
scattered
about
at
the
farther
end
in
a
fissure
of
the
rock
were
stones
regularly
built
up
the
remains
of
a
larger
fire
and
what
the
hunter
did
not
doubt
was
the
smelting
furnace
of
the
spaniards
he
poked
about
in
the
ashes
but
found
no
silver
that
had
all
been
carried
away
but
what
most
provoked
his
wonder
in
this
rude
cave
was
a
chair
i
this
was
not
such
a
seat
as
a
woodman
might
knock
up
with
an
axe
with
rough
body
and
a
seat
of
woven
splits
but
a
manufactured
chair
of
commerce
and
a
chair
too
of
an
unusual
pattern
and
some
elegance
this
chair
itself
was
a
mute
witness
of
luxury
and
mystery
the
chair
itself
might
have
been
accounted
for
though
i
do
know
how
but
upon
the
back
of
the
chair
hung
as
if
the
owner
had
carelessly
flung
it
there
before
going
out
an
hour
before
a
man
waistcoat
this
waistcoat
seemed
to
him
of
foreign
make
and
peculiar
style
but
what
endeared
it
to
him
was
its
row
of
metal
buttons
these
buttons
were
of
silver
i
forget
now
whether
he
did
not
say
they
were
of
silver
coin
and
that
the
coin
was
spanish
but
i
am
not
certain
about
this
latter
fact
and
i
wish
to
cast
no
air
of
improbability
over
my
narrative
this
rich
vestment
the
hunter
carried
away
with
him
this
was
all
the
plunder
his
expedition
afforded
yes
there
was
one
other
article
and
to
my
mind
more
significant
than
the
vest
of
the
hidalgo
this
was
a
short
and
stout
crowbar
of
iron
not
one
of
the
long
crowbars
that
farmers
use
to
pry
up
stones
but
a
short
handy
one
such
as
you
would
use
in
digging
out
of
the
cracks
of
rocks
this
was
the
guide
simple
story
i
asked
him
what
became
of
the
vest
and
the
buttons
and
the
bar
of
iron
the
old
man
wore
the
vest
until
he
wore
it
out
and
then
he
handed
it
over
to
the
boys
and
they
wore
it
in
turn
till
they
wore
it
out
the
buttons
were
cut
off
and
kept
as
curiosities
they
were
about
the
cabin
and
the
children
had
them
to
play
with
the
guide
distinctly
remembers
playing
with
them
one
of
them
he
kept
for
a
long
time
and
he
did
know
but
he
could
find
it
now
but
he
guessed
it
had
disappeared
i
regretted
that
he
had
not
treasured
this
slender
verification
of
an
interesting
romance
but
he
said
in
those
days
he
never
paid
much
attention
to
such
things
lately
he
has
turned
the
subject
over
and
is
sorry
that
his
father
wore
out
the
vest
and
did
not
bring
away
the
chair
it
is
his
steady
purpose
to
find
the
cave
some
time
when
he
has
leisure
and
capture
the
chair
if
it
has
not
tumbled
to
pieces
but
about
the
crowbar
oh
i
that
is
all
right
the
guide
has
the
bar
at
his
house
in
keene
valley
and
has
always
used
it
i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
confirm
this
story
by
saying
that
next
day
i
saw
the
crowbar
and
had
it
in
my
hand
it
is
short
and
thick
and
the
most
interesting
kind
of
crowbar
this
evidence
is
enough
for
me
i
intend
in
the
course
of
this
vacation
to
search
for
the
cave
and
if
i
find
it
my
readers
shall
know
the
truth
about
it
if
it
destroys
the
only
bit
of
romance
connected
with
these
mountains
viii
what
some
people
call
pleasure
my
readers
were
promised
an
account
of
spaniard
cave
on
mountain
in
the
adirondacks
if
such
a
cave
exists
and
could
be
found
there
is
none
but
negative
evidence
that
this
is
a
mere
cave
of
the
imagination
the
void
fancy
of
a
vacant
hour
but
it
is
the
duty
of
the
historian
to
present
the
negative
testimony
of
a
fruitless
expedition
in
search
of
it
made
last
summer
i
beg
leave
to
offer
this
in
the
simple
language
befitting
all
sincere
exploits
of
a
geographical
character
the
summit
of
mountain
has
been
trodden
by
few
white
men
of
good
character
it
is
in
the
heart
of
a
hirsute
wilderness
it
is
itself
a
rough
and
unsocial
pile
of
granite
nearly
five
thousand
feet
high
bristling
with
a
stunted
and
unpleasant
growth
of
firs
and
balsams
and
there
is
no
earthly
reason
why
a
person
should
go
there
therefore
we
went
in
the
party
of
three
there
was
of
course
a
chaplain
the
guide
was
old
mountain
phelps
who
had
made
the
ascent
once
before
but
not
from
the
northwest
side
the
direction
from
which
we
approached
it
the
enthusiasm
of
this
philosopher
has
grown
with
his
years
and
outlived
his
endurance
we
carried
our
own
knapsacks
and
supplies
therefore
and
drew
upon
him
for
nothing
but
moral
reflections
and
a
general
knowledge
of
the
wilderness
our
first
day
route
was
through
the
woods
and
up
one
of
its
branches
to
the
head
of
caribou
pass
which
separates
nipple
top
from
colvin
it
was
about
the
first
of
september
no
rain
had
fallen
for
several
weeks
and
this
heart
of
the
forest
was
as
dry
as
tinder
a
lighted
match
dropped
anywhere
would
start
a
conflagration
this
dryness
has
its
advantages
the
walking
is
improved
the
long
heat
has
expressed
all
the
spicy
odors
of
the
cedars
and
balsams
and
the
woods
are
filled
with
a
soothing
fragrance
the
waters
of
the
streams
though
scant
and
clear
are
cold
as
ice
the
common
forest
chill
is
gone
from
the
air
the
afternoon
was
bright
there
was
a
feeling
of
exultation
and
adventure
in
stepping
off
into
the
open
but
pathless
forest
the
great
stems
of
deciduous
trees
were
mottled
with
patches
of
sunlight
which
brought
out
upon
the
variegated
barks
and
mosses
of
the
old
trunks
a
thousand
shifting
hues
there
is
nothing
like
a
primeval
wood
for
color
on
a
sunny
day
the
shades
of
green
and
brown
are
infinite
the
dull
red
of
the
hemlock
bark
glows
in
the
sun
the
russet
of
the
changing
becomes
brilliant
there
are
silvery
openings
here
and
there
and
everywhere
the
columns
rise
up
to
the
canopy
of
tender
green
which
supports
the
intense
blue
sky
and
holds
up
a
part
of
it
from
falling
through
in
fragments
to
the
floor
of
the
forest
decorators
can
learn
here
how
nature
dares
to
put
blue
and
green
in
juxtaposition
she
has
evidently
the
secret
of
harmonizing
all
the
colors
the
way
as
we
ascended
was
not
all
through
open
woods
dense
masses
of
firs
were
encountered
jagged
spurs
were
to
be
crossed
and
the
going
became
at
length
so
slow
and
toilsome
that
we
took
to
the
rocky
bed
of
a
stream
where
bowlders
and
flumes
and
cascades
offered
us
sufficient
variety
the
deeper
we
penetrated
the
greater
the
sense
of
savageness
and
solitude
in
the
silence
of
these
hidden
places
one
seems
to
approach
the
beginning
of
things
we
emerged
from
the
defile
into
an
open
basin
formed
by
the
curved
side
of
the
mountain
and
stood
silent
before
a
waterfall
coming
down
out
of
the
sky
in
the
centre
of
the
curve
i
do
not
know
anything
exactly
like
this
fall
which
some
poetical
explorer
has
named
the
falls
it
appears
to
have
a
height
of
something
like
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
and
the
water
falls
obliquely
across
the
face
of
the
cliff
from
left
to
right
in
short
steps
which
in
the
moonlight
might
seem
like
a
veritable
ladder
for
fairies
our
impression
of
its
height
was
confirmed
by
climbing
the
very
steep
slope
at
its
side
some
three
or
four
hundred
feet
at
the
top
we
found
the
stream
flowing
over
a
broad
bed
of
rock
like
a
street
in
the
wilderness
slanting
up
still
towards
the
sky
and
bordered
by
low
firs
and
balsams
and
bowlders
completely
covered
with
moss
it
was
above
the
world
and
open
to
the
sky
on
account
of
the
tindery
condition
of
the
woods
we
made
our
fire
on
the
natural
pavement
and
selected
a
smooth
place
for
our
bed
near
by
on
the
flat
rock
with
a
pool
of
limpid
water
at
the
foot
this
granite
couch
we
covered
with
the
dry
and
springy
moss
which
we
stripped
off
in
heavy
fleeces
a
foot
thick
from
the
bowlders
first
however
we
fed
upon
the
fruit
that
was
offered
us
over
these
hills
of
moss
ran
an
exquisite
vine
with
a
tiny
ovate
green
leaf
bearing
small
delicate
berries
oblong
and
white
as
wax
having
a
faint
flavor
of
wintergreen
and
the
slightest
acid
taste
the
very
essence
of
the
wilderness
fairy
food
no
doubt
and
too
refined
for
palates
accustomed
to
coarser
viands
there
must
exist
somewhere
sinless
women
who
could
eat
these
berries
without
being
reminded
of
the
lost
purity
and
delicacy
of
the
primeval
senses
every
year
i
doubt
not
this
stainless
berry
ripens
here
and
is
unplucked
by
any
knight
of
the
holy
grail
who
is
worthy
to
eat
it
and
keeps
alive
in
the
prodigality
of
nature
the
tradition
of
the
unperverted
conditions
of
taste
before
the
fall
we
ate
these
berries
i
am
bound
to
say
with
a
sense
of
guilty
enjoyment
as
if
they
had
been
a
sort
of
of
the
wilderness
though
i
can
not
answer
for
the
chaplain
who
is
by
virtue
of
his
office
a
little
nearer
to
these
mysteries
of
nature
than
i
this
plant
belongs
to
the
heath
family
and
is
first
cousin
to
the
blueberry
and
cranberry
it
is
commonly
called
the
creeping
snowberry
but
i
like
better
its
official
title
of
chiogenes
the
our
mossy
was
named
the
bridal
chamber
camp
in
the
enthusiasm
of
the
hour
after
darkness
fell
upon
the
woods
and
the
stars
came
out
we
were
two
thousand
five
hundred
feet
above
the
common
world
we
lay
as
it
were
on
a
shelf
in
the
sky
with
a
basin
of
illimitable
forests
below
us
and
dim
the
far
horizon
and
as
we
lay
there
courting
sleep
which
the
blinking
stars
refused
to
shower
down
our
philosopher
discoursed
to
us
of
the
principle
of
fire
which
he
holds
with
the
ancients
to
be
an
independent
element
that
comes
and
goes
in
a
mysterious
manner
as
we
see
flame
spring
up
and
vanish
and
is
in
some
way
vital
and
indestructible
and
has
a
mysterious
relation
to
the
source
of
all
things
flame
he
says
have
put
out
but
where
has
it
gone
we
could
not
say
nor
whether
it
is
anything
like
the
spirit
of
a
man
which
is
here
for
a
little
hour
and
then
vanishes
away
our
own
philosophy
of
the
correlation
of
forces
found
no
sort
of
favor
at
that
elevation
and
we
went
to
sleep
leaving
the
principle
of
fire
in
the
apostolic
category
of
other
at
daylight
we
were
astir
and
having
pressed
the
principle
of
fire
into
our
service
to
make
a
pot
of
tea
we
carefully
extinguished
it
or
sent
it
into
another
place
and
addressed
ourselves
to
the
climb
of
some
thing
over
two
thousand
feet
the
arduous
labor
of
scaling
an
alpine
peak
has
a
compensating
glory
but
the
dead
lift
of
our
bodies
up
nipple
top
had
no
stimulus
of
this
sort
it
is
simply
hard
work
for
which
the
strained
muscles
only
get
the
approbation
of
the
individual
conscience
that
drives
them
to
the
task
the
pleasure
of
such
an
ascent
is
difficult
to
explain
on
the
spot
and
i
suspect
consists
not
so
much
in
positive
enjoyment
as
in
the
delight
the
mind
experiences
in
tyrannizing
over
the
body
i
do
not
object
to
the
elevation
of
this
mountain
nor
to
the
uncommonly
steep
grade
by
which
it
attains
it
but
only
to
the
other
obstacles
thrown
in
the
way
of
the
climber
all
the
slopes
of
nipple
top
are
hirsute
and
jagged
to
the
last
degree
granite
ledges
interpose
granite
bowlders
seem
to
have
been
dumped
over
the
sides
with
no
more
attempt
at
arrangement
than
in
a
wall
the
slashes
and
windfalls
of
a
century
present
here
and
there
an
almost
impenetrable
chevalier
des
arbres
and
the
steep
sides
bristle
with
a
mass
of
thick
balsams
with
dead
protruding
spikes
as
unyielding
as
iron
stakes
the
mountain
has
had
its
own
way
forever
and
is
as
untamed
as
a
wolf
or
rather
the
elements
the
frightful
tempests
the
frosts
the
heavy
snows
the
coaxing
sun
and
the
avalanches
have
had
their
way
with
it
until
its
surface
is
in
hopeless
confusion
we
made
our
way
very
slowly
and
it
was
ten
before
we
reached
what
appeared
to
be
the
summit
a
ridge
deeply
covered
with
moss
low
balsams
and
i
say
appeared
to
be
for
we
stood
in
thick
fog
or
in
the
heart
of
clouds
which
limited
our
dim
view
to
a
radius
of
twenty
feet
it
was
a
warm
and
cheerful
fog
stirred
by
little
wind
but
moving
shifting
and
boiling
as
by
its
own
volatile
nature
rolling
up
black
from
below
and
dancing
in
silvery
splendor
overhead
as
a
fog
it
could
not
have
been
improved
as
a
medium
for
viewing
the
landscape
it
was
a
failure
and
we
lay
down
upon
the
sybarite
couch
of
moss
as
in
a
russian
bath
to
await
revelations
we
waited
two
hours
without
change
except
an
occasional
hopeful
lightness
in
the
fog
above
and
at
last
the
appearance
for
a
moment
of
the
spectral
sun
only
for
an
instant
was
this
luminous
promise
vouchsafed
but
we
watched
in
intense
excitement
there
it
was
again
and
this
time
the
fog
was
so
thin
overhead
that
we
caught
sight
of
a
patch
of
blue
sky
a
yard
square
across
which
the
curtain
was
instantly
drawn
a
little
wind
was
stirring
and
the
fog
boiled
up
from
the
valley
caldrons
thicker
than
ever
but
the
spell
was
broken
in
a
moment
more
old
phelps
was
shouting
sun
and
before
we
could
gain
our
feet
there
was
a
patch
of
sky
overhead
as
big
as
a
farm
quick
the
old
man
was
dancing
like
a
lunatic
there
was
a
rift
in
the
vapor
at
our
feet
down
down
three
thousand
feet
into
the
forest
abyss
and
lo
lifting
out
of
it
yonder
the
tawny
side
of
dix
the
vision
of
a
second
snatched
away
in
the
rolling
fog
the
play
had
just
begun
before
we
could
turn
there
was
the
gorge
of
caribou
pass
savage
and
dark
visible
to
the
bottom
the
opening
shut
as
suddenly
and
then
looking
over
the
clouds
miles
away
we
saw
the
peaceful
farms
of
the
au
sable
valley
and
in
a
moment
more
the
plateau
of
north
elba
and
the
sentinel
mountains
about
the
grave
of
john
brown
these
glimpses
were
as
fleeting
as
thought
and
instantly
we
were
again
isolated
in
the
sea
of
mist
the
expectation
of
these
sudden
strokes
of
sublimity
kept
us
exultingly
on
the
alert
and
yet
it
was
a
blow
of
surprise
when
the
curtain
was
swiftly
withdrawn
on
the
west
and
the
long
ridge
of
colvin
seemingly
within
a
stone
throw
heaved
up
like
an
island
out
of
the
ocean
and
was
the
next
moment
ingulfed
we
waited
longer
for
dix
to
show
its
shapely
peak
and
its
glistening
sides
of
rock
gashed
by
avalanches
the
fantastic
clouds
torn
and
streaming
hurried
up
from
the
south
in
haste
as
if
to
a
witch
rendezvous
hiding
and
disclosing
the
great
summit
in
their
flight
the
mist
boiled
up
from
the
valley
whirled
over
the
summit
where
we
stood
and
plunged
again
into
the
depths
objects
were
forming
and
disappearing
shifting
and
dancing
now
in
sun
and
now
gone
in
fog
and
in
the
elemental
whirl
we
felt
that
we
were
in
an
original
process
of
creation
the
sun
strove
and
his
very
striving
called
up
new
vapors
the
wind
rent
away
the
clouds
and
brought
new
masses
to
surge
about
us
and
the
spectacle
to
right
and
left
above
and
below
changed
with
incredible
swiftness
such
glory
of
abyss
and
summit
of
color
and
form
and
transformation
is
seldom
granted
to
mortal
eyes
for
an
hour
we
watched
it
until
our
vast
mountain
was
revealed
in
all
its
bulk
its
long
spurs
its
abysses
and
its
savagery
and
the
great
basins
of
wilderness
with
their
shining
lakes
and
the
giant
peaks
of
the
region
were
one
by
one
disclosed
and
hidden
and
again
tranquil
in
the
sunshine
where
was
the
cave
there
was
ample
surface
in
which
to
look
for
it
if
we
could
have
flitted
about
like
the
hawks
that
came
circling
round
over
the
steep
slopes
the
long
spurs
the
jagged
precipices
i
have
no
doubt
we
should
have
found
it
but
moving
about
on
this
mountain
is
not
a
holiday
pastime
and
we
were
chiefly
anxious
to
discover
a
practicable
mode
of
descent
into
the
great
wilderness
basin
on
the
south
which
we
must
traverse
that
afternoon
before
reaching
the
hospitable
shanty
on
mud
pond
it
was
enough
for
us
to
have
discovered
the
general
whereabouts
of
the
spanish
cave
and
we
left
the
fixing
of
its
exact
position
to
future
explorers
the
spur
we
chose
for
our
escape
looked
smooth
in
the
distance
but
we
found
it
bristling
with
obstructions
dead
balsams
set
thickly
together
slashes
of
fallen
timber
and
every
manner
of
woody
chaos
and
when
at
length
we
swung
and
tumbled
off
the
ledge
to
the
general
slope
we
exchanged
only
for
more
disagreeable
going
the
slope
for
a
couple
of
thousand
feet
was
steep
enough
but
it
was
formed
of
granite
rocks
all
so
that
the
footing
could
not
be
determined
and
at
short
intervals
we
nearly
went
out
of
sight
in
holes
under
the
treacherous
carpeting
add
to
this
that
stems
of
great
trees
were
laid
longitudinally
and
transversely
and
over
and
among
the
rocks
and
the
reader
can
see
that
a
good
deal
of
work
needs
to
be
done
to
make
this
a
practicable
highway
for
anything
but
a
squirrel
we
had
had
no
water
since
our
daylight
breakfast
our
lunch
on
the
mountain
had
been
moistened
only
by
the
fog
our
thirst
began
to
be
that
of
tantalus
because
we
could
hear
the
water
running
deep
down
among
the
rocks
but
we
could
not
come
at
it
the
imagination
drank
the
living
stream
and
we
realized
anew
what
delusive
food
the
imagination
furnishes
in
an
actual
strait
a
good
deal
of
the
crime
of
this
world
i
am
convinced
is
the
direct
result
of
the
unlicensed
play
of
the
imagination
in
adverse
circumstances
this
reflection
had
nothing
to
do
with
our
actual
situation
for
we
added
to
our
imagination
patience
and
to
our
patience
and
probably
all
the
christian
virtues
would
have
been
developed
in
us
if
the
descent
had
been
long
enough
before
we
reached
the
bottom
of
caribou
pass
the
water
burst
out
from
the
rocks
in
a
clear
stream
that
was
as
cold
as
ice
shortly
after
we
struck
the
roaring
brook
that
issues
from
the
pass
to
the
south
it
is
a
stream
full
of
character
not
navigable
even
for
trout
in
the
upper
part
but
a
succession
of
falls
cascades
flumes
and
pools
that
would
delight
an
artist
it
is
not
an
easy
bed
for
anything
except
water
to
descend
and
before
we
reached
the
level
reaches
where
the
stream
flows
with
a
murmurous
noise
through
open
woods
one
of
our
party
began
to
show
signs
of
exhaustion
this
was
old
phelps
whose
appetite
had
failed
the
day
before
his
imagination
being
in
better
working
order
than
his
stomach
he
had
eaten
little
that
day
and
his
legs
became
so
groggy
that
he
was
obliged
to
rest
at
short
intervals
here
was
a
situation
the
afternoon
was
wearing
away
we
had
six
or
seven
miles
of
unknown
wilderness
to
traverse
a
portion
of
it
swampy
in
which
a
progress
of
more
than
a
mile
an
hour
is
difficult
and
the
condition
of
the
guide
compelled
even
a
slower
march
what
should
we
do
in
that
lonesome
solitude
if
the
guide
became
disabled
we
could
carry
him
out
could
we
find
our
own
way
out
to
get
assistance
the
guide
himself
had
never
been
there
before
and
although
he
knew
the
general
direction
of
our
point
of
egress
and
was
entirely
adequate
to
extricate
himself
from
any
position
in
the
woods
his
knowledge
was
of
that
occult
sort
possessed
by
woodsmen
which
it
is
impossible
to
communicate
our
object
was
to
strike
a
trail
that
led
from
the
au
sable
pond
the
other
side
of
the
to
an
inlet
on
mud
pond
we
knew
that
if
we
traveled
southwestward
far
enough
we
must
strike
that
trail
but
how
far
no
one
could
tell
if
we
reached
that
trail
and
found
a
boat
at
the
inlet
there
would
be
only
a
row
of
a
couple
of
miles
to
the
house
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
if
no
boat
was
there
then
we
must
circle
the
lake
three
or
four
miles
farther
through
a
with
no
trail
in
particular
the
prospect
was
not
pleasing
we
were
short
of
supplies
for
we
had
not
expected
to
pass
that
night
in
the
woods
the
pleasure
of
the
excursion
began
to
develop
itself
we
stumbled
on
in
the
general
direction
marked
out
through
a
forest
that
began
to
seem
endless
as
hour
after
hour
passed
compelled
as
we
were
to
make
long
detours
over
the
ridges
of
the
foothills
to
avoid
the
swamp
which
sent
out
from
the
border
of
the
lake
long
tongues
into
the
firm
ground
the
guide
became
more
ill
at
every
step
and
needed
frequent
halts
and
long
rests
food
he
could
not
eat
and
tea
water
and
even
brandy
he
rejected
again
and
again
the
old
philosopher
enfeebled
by
excessive
exertion
and
illness
would
collapse
in
a
heap
on
the
ground
an
almost
comical
picture
of
despair
while
we
stood
and
waited
the
waning
of
the
day
and
peered
forward
in
vain
for
any
sign
of
an
open
country
at
every
brook
we
encountered
we
suggested
a
halt
for
the
night
while
it
was
still
light
enough
to
select
a
but
the
plucky
old
man
would
hear
of
it
the
trail
might
be
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
and
we
crawled
on
again
at
a
snail
pace
his
honor
as
a
guide
seemed
to
be
at
stake
and
besides
he
confessed
to
a
notion
that
his
end
was
near
and
he
did
want
to
die
like
a
dog
in
the
woods
and
yet
if
this
was
his
last
journey
it
seemed
not
an
inappropriate
ending
for
the
old
woodsman
to
lie
down
and
give
up
the
ghost
in
the
midst
of
the
untamed
forest
and
the
solemn
silences
he
felt
most
at
home
in
there
is
a
popular
theory
held
by
civilians
that
a
soldier
likes
to
die
in
battle
i
suppose
it
is
as
true
that
a
woodsman
would
like
to
in
his
chips
the
figure
seems
to
be
inevitable
struck
down
by
illness
and
exposure
in
the
forest
solitude
with
heaven
in
sight
and
a
for
his
pillow
the
guide
seemed
really
to
fear
that
if
we
did
not
get
out
of
the
woods
that
night
he
would
never
go
out
and
yielding
to
his
dogged
resolution
we
kept
on
in
search
of
the
trail
although
the
gathering
of
dusk
over
the
ground
warned
us
that
we
might
easily
cross
the
trail
without
recognizing
it
we
were
traveling
by
the
light
in
the
upper
sky
and
by
the
forms
of
the
which
every
moment
grew
dimmer
at
last
the
end
came
we
had
just
felt
our
way
over
what
seemed
to
be
a
little
run
of
water
when
the
old
man
sunk
down
remarking
might
as
well
die
here
as
anywhere
and
was
silent
suddenly
night
fell
like
a
blanket
on
us
we
could
neither
see
the
guide
nor
each
other
we
became
at
once
conscious
that
miles
of
night
on
all
sides
shut
us
in
the
sky
was
clouded
over
there
was
a
gleam
of
light
to
show
us
where
to
step
our
first
thought
was
to
build
a
fire
which
would
drive
back
the
thick
darkness
into
the
woods
and
boil
some
water
for
our
tea
but
it
was
too
dark
to
use
the
axe
we
scraped
together
leaves
and
twigs
to
make
a
blaze
and
as
this
failed
such
dead
sticks
as
we
could
find
by
groping
about
the
fire
was
only
a
temporary
affair
but
it
sufficed
to
boil
a
can
of
water
the
water
we
obtained
by
feeling
about
the
stones
of
the
little
run
for
an
opening
big
enough
to
dip
our
cup
in
the
supper
to
be
prepared
was
fortunately
simple
it
consisted
of
a
decoction
of
tea
and
other
leaves
which
had
got
into
the
pail
and
a
part
of
a
loaf
of
bread
a
loaf
of
bread
which
has
been
carried
in
a
knapsack
for
a
couple
of
days
bruised
and
handled
and
hacked
at
with
a
becomes
an
uninteresting
object
but
we
ate
of
it
with
thankfulness
washed
it
down
with
hot
fluid
and
bitterly
thought
of
the
morrow
would
our
old
friend
survive
the
night
would
he
be
in
any
condition
to
travel
in
the
morning
how
were
we
to
get
out
with
him
or
without
him
the
old
man
lay
silent
in
the
bushes
out
of
sight
and
desired
only
to
be
let
alone
we
tried
to
tempt
him
with
the
offer
of
a
piece
of
toast
it
was
no
temptation
tea
we
thought
would
revive
him
he
refused
it
a
drink
of
brandy
would
certainly
quicken
his
life
he
could
touch
it
we
were
at
the
end
of
our
resources
he
seemed
to
think
that
if
he
were
at
home
and
could
get
a
bit
of
fried
bacon
or
a
piece
of
pie
he
should
be
all
right
we
knew
no
more
how
to
doctor
him
than
if
he
had
been
a
sick
bear
he
withdrew
within
himself
rolled
himself
up
so
to
speak
in
his
primitive
habits
and
waited
for
the
healing
power
of
nature
before
our
feeble
fire
disappeared
we
smoothed
a
level
place
near
it
for
phelps
to
lie
on
and
got
him
over
to
it
but
it
suit
it
was
too
open
in
fact
at
the
moment
some
drops
of
rain
fell
rain
was
quite
outside
of
our
program
for
the
night
but
the
guide
had
an
instinct
about
it
and
while
we
were
groping
about
some
yards
distant
for
a
place
where
we
could
lie
down
he
crawled
away
into
the
darkness
and
curled
himself
up
amid
the
roots
of
a
gigantic
pine
very
much
as
a
bear
would
do
i
suppose
with
his
back
against
the
trunk
and
there
passed
the
night
comparatively
dry
and
comfortable
but
of
this
we
knew
nothing
till
morning
and
had
to
trust
to
the
assurance
of
a
voice
out
of
the
darkness
that
he
was
all
right
our
own
bed
where
we
spread
our
blankets
was
excellent
in
one
respect
there
was
no
danger
of
tumbling
out
of
it
at
first
the
rain
pattered
gently
on
the
leaves
overhead
and
we
congratulated
ourselves
on
the
snugness
of
our
situation
there
was
something
cheerful
about
this
free
life
we
contrasted
our
condition
with
that
of
tired
invalids
who
were
tossing
on
downy
beds
and
wooing
sleep
in
vain
nothing
was
so
wholesome
and
invigorating
as
this
bivouac
in
the
forest
but
somehow
sleep
did
not
come
the
rain
had
ceased
to
patter
and
began
to
fall
with
a
steady
determination
a
sort
of
soak
soak
all
about
us
in
fact
it
roared
on
the
rubber
blanket
and
beat
in
our
faces
the
wind
began
to
stir
a
little
and
there
was
a
moaning
on
high
not
contented
with
dripping
the
rain
was
driven
into
our
faces
another
suspicious
circumstance
was
noticed
little
rills
of
water
got
established
along
the
sides
under
the
blankets
cold
undeniable
streams
that
interfered
with
drowsiness
pools
of
water
settled
on
the
bed
and
the
chaplain
had
a
habit
of
moving
suddenly
and
letting
a
quart
or
two
inside
and
down
my
neck
it
began
to
be
evident
that
we
and
our
bed
were
probably
the
wettest
objects
in
the
woods
the
rubber
was
an
excellent
there
was
no
trouble
about
ventilation
but
we
found
that
we
had
established
our
quarters
without
any
provision
for
drainage
there
was
not
exactly
a
wild
tempest
abroad
but
there
was
a
degree
of
liveliness
in
the
thrashing
limbs
and
the
creaking
of
the
which
rubbed
against
each
other
and
the
pouring
rain
increased
in
volume
and
power
of
penetration
sleep
was
quite
out
of
the
question
with
so
much
to
distract
our
attention
in
fine
our
misery
became
so
perfect
that
we
both
broke
out
into
loud
and
sarcastic
laughter
over
the
absurdity
of
our
situation
we
had
subjected
ourselves
to
all
this
forlornness
simply
for
pleasure
whether
old
phelps
was
still
in
existence
we
tell
we
could
get
no
response
from
him
with
daylight
if
he
continued
ill
and
could
not
move
our
situation
would
be
little
improved
our
supplies
were
gone
we
lay
in
a
pond
a
deluge
of
water
was
pouring
down
on
us
this
was
summer
recreation
the
whole
thing
was
so
excessively
absurd
that
we
laughed
again
louder
than
ever
we
had
plenty
of
this
sort
of
amusement
suddenly
through
the
night
we
heard
a
sort
of
reply
that
started
us
bolt
upright
this
was
a
prolonged
squawk
it
was
like
the
voice
of
no
beast
or
bird
with
which
we
were
familiar
at
first
it
was
distant
but
it
rapidly
approached
tearing
through
the
night
and
apparently
through
the
like
the
harsh
cry
of
a
bird
with
a
snarl
in
it
in
fact
as
i
said
a
squawk
it
came
close
to
us
and
then
turned
and
as
rapidly
as
it
came
fled
away
through
the
forest
and
we
lost
the
unearthly
noise
far
up
the
was
that
phelps
we
cried
out
but
no
response
came
and
we
wondered
if
his
spirit
had
been
rent
away
or
if
some
evil
genius
had
sought
it
and
then
baffled
by
his
serene
and
philosophic
spirit
had
shot
off
into
the
void
in
rage
and
disappointment
the
night
had
no
other
adventure
the
moon
at
length
coming
up
behind
the
clouds
lent
a
spectral
aspect
to
the
forest
and
deceived
us
for
a
time
into
the
notion
that
day
was
at
hand
but
the
rain
never
ceased
and
we
lay
wishful
and
waiting
with
no
item
of
solid
misery
wanting
that
we
could
conceive
day
was
slow
and
did
amount
to
much
when
it
came
so
heavy
were
the
clouds
but
the
rain
slackened
we
crawled
out
of
our
and
sought
the
guide
to
our
infinite
relief
he
announced
himself
not
only
alive
but
in
a
going
condition
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
had
stopped
at
five
i
poured
the
water
out
of
it
and
shook
it
but
not
being
constructed
on
the
hydraulic
principle
it
refused
to
go
some
hours
later
we
encountered
a
huntsman
from
whom
i
procured
some
with
this
i
filled
the
watch
and
heated
it
in
by
the
fire
this
is
a
most
effectual
way
of
treating
a
delicate
genevan
timepiece
the
light
disclosed
fully
the
suspected
fact
that
our
bed
had
been
made
in
a
slight
depression
the
under
rubber
blanket
spread
in
this
had
prevented
the
rain
from
soaking
into
the
ground
and
we
had
been
lying
in
what
was
in
fact
a
bathtub
while
old
phelps
was
pulling
himself
together
and
we
were
wringing
some
gallons
of
water
out
of
our
blankets
we
questioned
the
old
man
about
the
and
what
bird
was
possessed
of
such
a
voice
it
was
not
a
bird
at
all
he
said
but
a
cat
the
of
the
woods
larger
than
the
domestic
animal
and
an
ugly
customer
who
is
fond
of
fish
and
carries
a
pelt
that
is
worth
two
or
three
dollars
in
the
market
occasionally
he
blunders
into
a
and
he
is
altogether
hateful
in
his
ways
and
has
the
most
uncultivated
voice
that
is
heard
in
the
woods
we
shall
remember
him
as
one
of
the
least
pleasant
phantoms
of
that
cheerful
night
when
we
lay
in
the
storm
fearing
any
moment
the
advent
to
one
of
us
of
the
grimmest
messenger
we
rolled
up
and
shouldered
our
wet
belongings
and
before
the
shades
had
yet
lifted
from
the
saturated
bushes
pursued
our
march
it
was
a
relief
to
be
again
in
motion
although
our
progress
was
slow
and
it
was
a
question
every
rod
whether
the
guide
could
go
on
we
had
the
day
before
us
but
if
we
did
not
find
a
boat
at
the
inlet
a
day
might
not
suffice
in
the
weak
condition
of
the
guide
to
extricate
us
from
our
ridiculous
position
there
was
nothing
heroic
in
it
we
had
no
object
it
was
merely
as
it
must
appear
by
this
time
a
pleasure
excursion
and
we
might
be
lost
or
perish
in
it
without
reward
and
with
little
sympathy
we
had
something
like
a
hour
and
a
half
of
stumbling
through
the
swamp
when
suddenly
we
stood
in
the
little
trail
slight
as
it
was
it
appeared
to
us
a
very
broadway
to
paradise
if
broad
ways
ever
lead
thither
phelps
hailed
it
and
sank
down
in
it
like
one
reprieved
from
death
but
the
boat
leaving
him
we
quickly
ran
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
to
the
inlet
the
boat
was
there
our
shout
to
the
guide
would
have
roused
him
out
of
a
he
came
down
the
trail
with
the
agility
of
an
aged
deer
never
was
so
glad
a
sound
in
his
ear
he
said
as
that
shout
it
was
in
a
very
jubilant
mood
that
we
emptied
the
boat
of
water
pushed
off
shipped
the
clumsy
oars
and
bent
to
the
row
through
the
black
waters
of
the
winding
desolate
channel
and
over
the
lake
whose
dark
waves
were
tossed
a
little
in
the
morning
breeze
the
trunks
of
dead
trees
stand
about
this
lake
and
all
its
shores
are
ragged
with
ghastly
but
it
was
open
to
the
sky
and
although
the
heavy
clouds
still
obscured
all
the
we
had
a
sense
of
escape
and
freedom
that
almost
made
the
melancholy
scene
lovely
how
lightly
past
hardship
sits
upon
us
all
the
misery
of
the
night
vanished
as
if
it
had
not
been
in
the
shelter
of
the
log
cabin
at
mud
pond
with
dry
clothes
that
fitted
us
as
the
skin
of
the
bear
fits
him
in
the
spring
a
noble
breakfast
a
toasting
fire
solicitude
about
our
comfort
judicious
sympathy
with
our
suffering
and
willingness
to
hear
the
now
growing
tale
of
our
adventure
then
came
in
a
day
of
absolute
idleness
while
the
showers
came
and
went
and
the
mountains
appeared
and
disappeared
in
sun
and
storm
that
perfect
physical
enjoyment
which
consists
in
a
feeling
of
strength
without
any
inclination
to
use
it
and
in
a
delicious
languor
which
is
too
enjoyable
to
be
surrendered
to
sleep
