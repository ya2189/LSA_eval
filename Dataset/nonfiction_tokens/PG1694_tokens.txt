was
written
to
see
what
laws
have
been
in

for
a
long
time
and
therefore
have
proven
their
success
in
maintaining
a
stable
society

also
to
see
the
historical

in
which
our
legal

were
derived

at
the

of
the
common

this
book
is
a
primer
one
may
read
it
without
prior
knowledge
in
history
or
law
although
it
will
be
more
meaningful
to
lawyers
than
to
since
it
defines
terms
unique
to
english
legal
history
it
may
serve
as
a
good
introduction
on
which
to
base
further
reading
in
english
legal
history
the
meaning
of
some
terms
in
king
aethelbert
code
in
chapter
are
unknown
or
inexact
the
chapters
are
sequential
the
title
of
each
chapter
in
the
table
of
contents
includes
the
time
period
covered
the
title
of
each
chapter
denotes
an
important
legal
development
of
that
time
period
each
chapter
is
divided
into
three
sections
the
times
the
law
and
judicial
procedure
the
law
section
is
the
central
section
it
describes
the
law
governing
the
behavior
and
conduct
of
the
populace
it
includes
law
of
that
time
by
which
people
lived
which
is
the
same
similar
or
a
building
block
to
the
law
of
today
in
earlier
times
this
is
both
statutory
law
and
the
common
law
of
the
court
the
magna
carta
which
is
quoted
in
chapter
is
the
first
statute
of
the
statutes
at
large
the
law
sections
of
chapter
mainly
quote
or
paraphrase
most
of
these
statutes
or
the
statutes
of
the
realm
excluded
are
statutes
which
do
not
help
us
understand
the
development
of
our
law
such
as
statutes
governing
wales
after
its
conquest
and
statutes
on
succession
rights
to
the
throne
the
first
section
of
each
chapter
the
times
sets
a
background
and
context
in
which
to
better
understand
the
laws
the
usual
subject
matter
of
history
such
as
battles
famines
periods
of
corruption
and
international
relations
are
omitted
as
not
helping
to
understand
the
process
of
civilization
and
development
of
the
law
in
the
nation
of
england
the
last
section
of
each
chapter
judicial
procedure
describes
the
process
of
applying
the
law
and
trying
cases
for
the
relevant
time
period
it
also
contains
some
examples
of
cases
for
clarity
and
easy
comparison
amounts
of
money
expressed
in
pounds
or
marks
have
been
converted
to
the
smaller
denominations
of
shillings
and
pence
there
are
twenty
shillings
in
a
pound
a
mark
in
silver
is
two
thirds
of
a
pound
the

bibliography
chapter
the
times
before
clans
headed
by
kings
lived
in
huts
on
top
of
hills
or
other
high
places
and
fortified
by
circular
or
rectangular
earth
ditches
and
banks
behind
which
they
could
gather
with
their
herds
for
protection
at
the
entrances
were
several
openings
only
one
of
which
really
allowed
entry
the
others
went
between
banks
into
dead
ends
and
served
as
traps
in
which
to
kill
the
enemy
from
above
concentric
circles
of
ditches
around
these
fortified
camps
could
reach
to
acres
the
people
lived
in
circular
huts
with
wood
posts
in
a
circle
supporting
a
roof
the
walls
were
made
of
saplings
and
a
mixture
of
mud
and
straw
sometimes
there
were
stalls
for
cattle
cooking
was
in
a
clay
oven
inside
or
over
an
open
fire
on
the
outside
forests
abounded
with
wolves
bears
wild
boars
and
wild
cattle
people
wore
animal
skins
over
their
bodies
for
warmth
and
around
their
feet
for
protection
when
walking
they
carried
small
items
by
hooking
them
onto
their
belts
pathways
extended
through
this
camp
of
huts
and
for
many
miles
beyond
they
were
used
for
trade
and
transport
with
pack
horses
men
bought
or
captured
women
for
wives
and
carried
them
over
the
thresholds
of
their
huts
the
first
month
of
marriage
was
called
the
honeymoon
because
the
couple
was
given
mead
a
drink
with
fermented
honey
and
herbs
for
the
first
month
of
their
marriage
a
wife
wore
a
gold
wedding
band
on
the
ring
finger
of
her
left
hand
to
show
that
she
was
married
women
wore
other
jewelry
too
which
indicated
their
social
rank
women
usually
stayed
at
home
caring
for
children
preparing
meals
and
making
baskets
they
also
made
wool
felt
and
spun
and
wove
wool
into
cloth
flax
was
grown
and
woven
into
linen
cloth
the
weaving
was
done
on
an
upright
or
weighted
loom
people
draped
the
cloth
around
their
bodies
and
fastened
it
with
a
metal
brooch
inlayed
with
gold
gems
glass
and
shell
which
were
glued
on
with
glue
that
was
obtained
from
melting
animal
hooves
they
also
had
amber
beads
and
pendants
they
could
tie
things
with
rawhide
strips
or
rope
braids
they
made
they
cut
things
with
flint
dug
up
from
pits
on
the
coast
they
made
bone
harpoons
for
deep
sea
fish
the
king
who
was
tall
and
strong
led
his
men
in
hunting
groups
to
kill
deer
and
other
wild
animals
in
the
forests
and
to
fish
in
the
streams
some
men
brought
their
hunting
dogs
on
leashes
to
follow
scent
trails
to
the
animal
the
men
attacked
the
animals
with
spears
and
threw
stones
they
used
shields
to
protect
their
bodies
they
watched
the
phases
of
the
moon
and
learned
to
predict
when
it
would
be
full
and
give
the
most
light
for
night
hunting
this
began
the
concept
of
a
month
if
hunting
groups
from
two
clans
tried
to
follow
the
same
deer
there
might
be
a
fight
between
the
clans
or
a
blood
feud
after
the
battle
the
clan
would
bring
back
its
dead
and
wounded
a
priest
officiated
over
a
funeral
for
a
dead
man
his
wife
would
often
also
go
on
the
funeral
pyre
with
him
memorial
burial
mounds
would
be
erected
over
the
corpses
or
cremated
ashes
of
their
great
men
later
these
ashes
were
first
placed
in
urns
before
burial
in
a
mound
of
earth
or
the
corpses
were
buried
with
a
few
personal
items
the
priest
also
officiated
over
sacrifices
of
humans
who
were
usually
offenders
found
guilty
of
transgressions
sacrifices
were
usually
made
in
time
of
war
or
pestilence
and
usually
before
the
winter
made
food
scarce
at
halloween
time
humans
were
sometimes
eaten
the
clan
ate
deer
that
had
been
cooked
on
a
spit
over
a
fire
and
fruits
and
vegetables
which
had
been
gathered
by
the
women
they
drank
water
from
springs
in
the
spring
food
was
plentiful
there
were
eggs
of
different
colors
in
nests
and
many
rabbits
to
eat
the
goddess
easter
was
celebrated
at
this
time
after
this
hunting
and
gathering
era
there
was
farming
and
domestication
of
animals
such
as
horses
pigs
sheep
goats
chicken
and
cattle
of
these
the
pig
was
the
most
important
meat
supply
being
killed
and
salted
for
winter
use
next
in
importance
were
the
cattle
sheep
were
kept
primarily
for
their
wool
flocks
and
herds
were
taken
to
pastures
the
male
cattle
with
wood
yokes
pulled
ploughs
in
the
fields
of
barley
and
wheat
the
female
goat
and
cow
provided
milk
butter
and
cheese
the
chickens
provided
eggs
the
hoe
spade
and
grinding
stone
were
used
cloth
was
woven
for
clothes
pottery
was
made
from
clay
and
used
for
food
preparation
and
consumption
during
the
period
of
lent
from
the
word
lencten
which
means
spring
it
was
forbidden
to
eat
any
meat
or
fish
this
was
the
season
in
which
many
animals
were
born
and
grew
a
lot
the
people
also
made
boats
circles
of
big
stones
like
stonehenge
were
built
so
that
the
sun
position
with
respect
to
the
stones
would
indicate
the
day
of
longest
sunlight
and
the
day
of
shortest
sunlight
between
these
days
there
was
an
optimum
time
to
harvest
the
crops
before
fall
when
plants
dried
up
and
leaves
fell
from
the
trees
the
winter
solstice
when
the
days
began
to
get
longer
was
cause
for
celebration
in
the
next
season
there
was
an
optimum
time
to
plant
seeds
so
they
could
spring
up
from
the
ground
as
new
growth
so
farming
gave
rise
to
the
concept
of
a
year
certain
changes
of
the
year
were
celebrated
such
as
easter
the
twelve
days
of
yuletide
when
candles
were
lit
and
houses
decorated
with
evergreen
plough
monday
for
resumption
of
work
after
yuletide
may
day
when
greenery
was
gathered
from
the
woods
and
people
danced
around
a
may
pole
whitsun
when
morris
dancers
leapt
through
their
villages
with
bells
and
waving
scarves
lammas
when
the
first
bread
was
celebrated
and
harvest
home
when
the
effigy
of
a
goddess
was
carried
with
reapers
singing
and
piping
behind
there
were
settlements
on
high
ground
and
near
rivers
each
settlement
had
a
meadow
for
the
mowing
of
hay
and
a
mill
with
wooden
huts
covered
with
branches
or
thatch
of
families
clustered
nearby
grain
was
stored
in
pits
in
the
earth
each
hut
had
a
garden
for
fruit
and
vegetables
a
goat
or
cow
might
be
tied
out
of
reach
of
the
garden
there
was
a
fence
or
hedge
surrounding
and
protecting
the
garden
area
and
dwelling
outside
the
fence
were
an
acre
or
two
of
fields
of
wheat
and
barley
and
sometimes
oats
and
rye
wheat
and
rye
were
sown
in
the
fall
and
oats
and
barley
in
the
spring
they
were
all
harvested
in
the
summer
these
fields
were
usually
enclosed
with
a
hedge
to
keep
animals
from
eating
the
crop
flax
was
grown
and
made
into
linen
cloth
beyond
the
fields
were
pastures
for
cattle
and
sheep
grazing
there
was
often
an
area
for
beehives
crops
were
produced
with
the
open
field
system
in
this
system
there
were
three
large
fields
for
the
heavy
and
fertile
land
each
field
was
divided
into
long
and
narrow
strips
each
strip
represented
a
day
work
with
the
plough
one
field
had
wheat
or
perhaps
rye
another
had
barley
oats
beans
or
peas
and
the
third
was
fallow
these
were
rotated
yearly
each
free
man
was
allotted
certain
strips
in
each
field
to
bear
crops
his
strips
were
far
from
each
other
which
insured
some
very
fertile
and
some
only
fair
soil
and
some
land
near
his
village
dwelling
and
some
far
away
these
strips
he
cultivated
sowed
with
seed
and
harvested
for
himself
and
his
family
after
the
year
they
reverted
to
common
ownership
for
grazing
the
plough
used
was
heavy
and
made
first
of
wood
and
later
of
iron
it
had
a
which
caught
the
soil
stirred
by
the
plough
blade
and
threw
it
into
a
ridge
other
farm
implements
were
coulters
which
gave
free
passage
to
the
plough
by
cutting
weeds
and
turf
picks
spades
and
shovels
reaping
hooks
and
scythes
and
and
anvils
with
iron
axes
forests
were
cleared
to
provide
more
arable
land
the
use
of
this
open
field
system
instead
of
compact
enclosures
worked
by
individuals
was
necessary
in
primitive
communities
which
were
farming
only
for
their
own
subsistence
each
ox
was
owned
by
a
different
man
as
was
the
plough
strips
of
land
for
agriculture
were
added
from
waste
land
as
the
community
grew
there
were
villages
which
had
one
or
two
market
days
in
each
week
cattle
sheep
pigs
poultry
calves
and
rabbits
were
sold
there
flint
workers
mined
with
deer
antler
picks
and
ox
shoulder
blade
shovels
for
flint
to
grind
into
axes
spearheads
and
arrowheads
people
used
bone
and
stone
tools
such
as
stone
hammers
and
then
bronze
and
iron
tools
weapons
breast
plates
and
horse
bits
which
were
formed
from
moulds
forged
by
bronze
smiths
and
blacksmiths
weapons
included
bows
and
arrows
flint
and
copper
daggers
stone
axes
and
shields
of
wood
with
bronze
mountings
the
warriors
fought
with
chariots
drawn
by
two
horses
the
horse
harnesses
had
bronze
fittings
the
chariots
had
wood
wheels
later
with
iron
rims
when
bronze
came
into
use
there
was
a
demand
for
its
constituent
parts
copper
and
tin
which
were
traded
by
rafts
on
waterways
and
the
sea
lead
was
mined
wrought
iroin
bars
were
used
as
currency
corpses
were
buried
far
away
from
any
village
in
wood
coffins
except
for
kings
who
were
placed
in
stone
coffins
after
being
wrapped
in
linen
possessions
were
buried
with
them
with
the
ability
to
grow
food
and
the
acquisition
of
land
by
conquest
for
instance
by
invading
angles
and
saxons
the
population
grew
there
were
different
classes
of
men
such
as
eorls
ceorls
free
farmers
and
slaves
they
dressed
differently
freemen
had
long
hair
and
beards
slaves
hair
was
shorn
from
their
heads
so
that
they
were
bald
slaves
were
chained
and
often
traded
prisoners
taken
in
battle
britons
became
slaves
criminals
became
slaves
of
the
person
wronged
or
of
the
king
sometimes
a
father
pressed
by
need
sold
his
children
or
his
wife
into
bondage
debtors
who
increased
in
number
during
famine
which
occurred
regularly
became
slaves
by
giving
up
the
freeman
sword
and
spear
picking
up
a
mattock
pick
ax
for
the
soils
and
placing
their
head
within
a
master
hands
children
with
a
slave
parent
were
slaves
the
slaves
lived
in
huts
around
the
homes
of
big
landholders
which
were
made
of
logs
and
consisted
on
one
large
room
or
hall
an
open
hearth
was
in
the
middle
of
the
earthen
floor
which
was
strewn
with
rushes
there
was
a
hole
in
the
roof
to
let
out
the
smoke
here
the
landholder
and
his
men
would
eat
meat
bread
salt
hot
spiced
ale
and
mead
while
listening
to
minstrels
sing
about
the
heroic
deeds
of
their
ancestors
physical
strength
and
endurance
in
adversity
were
admired
traits
slaves
often
were
used
as
ploughmen
sowers
haywards
woodwards
shepherds
goatherds
swineherds
oxherds
cowherds
dairymaids
and
barnmen
a
lord
could
kill
his
slave
at
will
the
people
were
worshipping
pagan
gods
when
augustine
came
to
england
in
to
christianize
them
king
aethelbert
of
kent
and
his
wife
who
had
been
raised
christian
on
the
continent
met
him
when
he
arrived
the
king
gave
him
land
where
there
were
ruins
of
an
old
city
augustine
used
stones
from
the
ruins
to
build
a
church
which
was
later
called
canterbury
he
also
built
the
first
paul
church
in

fought
with
him
and
ate
in
his
household
gesiths

christian
augustine
knew
how
to
write
but
king
aethelbert
did
not
the
king
announced
his
laws
at
meetings
of
his
people
and
his
eorls
would
decide
the
punishments
there
was
a
fine
of
for
disregarding
a
command
of
the
king
he
and
augustine
decided
to
write
down
some
of
these
laws
which
now
included
the
king
new
law
concerning
the
church
these
laws
concern
personal
injury
murder
theft
burglary
marriage
adultery
and

wergeld
worth
to
his
kindred
for
causing
his

the

unified

established

called

usually
on
hill
tops

other
strategic
locations
on
the

to
control
the
main
road
and

were

they
were

enclosures
with
towers

thatched
huts
and
a
couple
of

gathered

who
were
at

included

men
each
of
whom
had
chosen

carried

dug

sometimes
fought
some
great

organized
men
under
them
whom
they
provisioned
these
vassals
took
a
personal
oath
to
their
lord
on
condition
that
he
keep
me
as
i
am
willing
to
deserve
and
fulfill
all
that
was
agreed
on
when
i
became
his
man
and
chose
his
will
as
mine
alfred
had
a
small
navy
of
longships
with
oars
to
fight
the
viking
longships
alfred
divided
his
army
into
two
parts
so
that
of
the
men
were
fighting
while
the
other
half
was
at
home
sowing
and
harvesting
for
those
fighting
thus
any
independent
farming
was
supplanted
by
the
system
cultivation
of
common
land
and
a
more
and
stratified
society
with
the
king
and
important
families
more
powerful
and
the
peasants
more
curtailed
many
free
coerls
of
the
older
days
became
bonded
the
village
community
became
a
manor
but
the
lord
does
not
have
the
power
to
encroach
upon
the
rights
of
common
that
exist
within
the
community
in
a
treaty
between
alfred
and
the
vikings
divided
the
country
along
the
war
front
and
made
the
wergeld
of
every
free
farmer
whether
english
or
viking
men
of
higher
rank
were
given
a
wergeld
of
marks
of
pure
gold
a
mark
was
probably
a
viking
denomination
and
a
mark
of
gold
was
equal
to
nine
marks
of
silver
in
later
times
and
probably
in
this
time
king
alfred
gave
land
with
jurisdictional
powers
within
its
boundaries
such

this

the

which
king
alfred
make

praise
of

and
mary
and
all
the
saints
of
god
for
the
benefit
of
my
soul
namely
a
hundred
hides
a
hide
was
probably
the
amount
of
land
which
could
support
a
family
for
a
year
or
as
much
land
as
could
be
tilled
annually
by

and
their

judicial
procedure
cases
were
held
at
monthly
meetings
of
the
community
the
king
or
his
representative
in
the
community
called
the
reeve
conducted
the
trial
by
compurgation
the
one
complaining
called
the
plaintiff
and
the
one
defending
called
the
defendant
each
told
their
story
and
put
his
hand
on
the
bible
and
swore
by
god
this
oath
is
clean
and
true
a
slip
or
a
stammer
would
mean
he
lost
the
case
otherwise
community
members
would
stand
up
to
swear
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
as
to
their
reputation
for
veracity
if
these
compurgators
were
too
few
usually
twelve
in
number
or
recited
poorly
their
party
lost
if
this
process
was
inconclusive
the
defendant
was
told
to
go
to
church
and
to
take
the
sacrament
only
if
he
were
innocent
if
he
took
the
sacrament
he
was
tried
by
the
process
of
ordeal
in
the
ordeal
by
cold
water
he
was
bound
hand
and
foot
and
then
thrown
into
water
if
he
floated
he
was
guilty
if
he
sank
he
was
innocent
it
was
not
necessary
to
drown
to
be
deemed
innocent
in
the
ordeal
by
hot
water
he
had
to
pick
up
a
stone
from
inside
a
boiling
cauldron
if
his
hand
was
healing
in
three
days
he
was
innocent
if
it
was
festering
he
was
guilty
a
similar
ordeal
was
that
of
hot
iron
in
which
one
had
to
carry
in
his
hands
a
hot
iron
for
a
certain
distance
although
the
results
of
the
ordeal
were
taken
to
indicate
the
will
of
god
the
official
conducting
the
ordeal
could
adjust
its
parameters
so
that
a
person
with
a
guilty
demeanor
would
be
found
guilty
and
a
person
with
an
innocent
demeanor
found
innocent
the
ordeal
seems
to
favor
the
physically
fit
because
a
person
who
was
not
fat
would
tend
to
sink
and
a
person
who
was
in
good
health
would
have
prompt
healing
of
burns
presumably
a
person
convicted
of
murder
killing
by
stealth
or
robbery
taking
from
a
person
robe
that
is
his
person
or
breaking
into
his
home
to
steal
would
be
hung
and
his
possessions
confiscated
the
issue
of
rights
to
herd
pigs
to
feed
in
certain
woodland
was
heard
in
this
lawsuit
in
the
year
which
had
passed
since
the
birth
of
christ
and
in
the
course
of
the
second
indiction
and
during
the
reign
of
beornwulf
king
of
mercia
a
council
meeting
was
held
in
the
famous
place
called
clofesho
and
there
the
said
king
beornwulf
and
his
bishops
and
his
earls
and
all
the
councilors
of
this
nation
were
assembled
then
there
was
a
very
noteworthy
suit
about
at
sinton
towards
the

the
reeves
in

of
the
pigherds
wished
to
extend
the
pasture
farther
and
take
in
more
of
the
wood
than
the
ancient
rights
permitted
then
the
bishop
and
the
advisors
of
the
community
said
that
they
would
not
admit
liability
for
more
than
had
been
appointed
in
aethelbald
day
namely
mast
for
swine
and
that
the
bishop
and
the
community
should
have
of
the
wood
and
of
the
mast
they
archbishop
wulfred
and
all
the
councilors
determined
that
the
bishop
and
the
community
might
declare
on
oath
that
it
was
so
appointed
in
aethelbald
time
and
that
they
were
not
trying
to
obtain
more
and
the
bishop
immediately
gave
security
to
earl
eadwulf
to
furnish
the
oath
before
all
the
councilors
and
it
was
produced
in
days
at
the
bishop
see
at
worcester
at
that
time
hama
was
the
reeve
in
charge
of
the
pigherds
at
sinton
and
he
rode
until
he
reached
worcester
and
watched
and
observed
the
oath
as
earl
eadwulf
bade
him
but
did
not
challenge
it

was
a
great
expansion
of

some
land
was
common
land
held
by
communities
if
a

often
an

would
protect
him
against
encroaching
neighbors
back
him
in
the
courts
of
law
and
feed
him
in
times
of
famine
often
knights
stayed
with
their
lords
at
their
large
houses
but
later
were
given
land
with
men
on
it
the
lords
were

all

they

in

he
was
responsible
for
the
royal

and
performed
functions
like
tracking
cattle
thieves
the

this
lawsuit
between
a
son
and
his
mother
over
land
was
heard
at
a
meeting
here
it
is
declared
in
this
document
that
a
sat
at
aylton
in
king
cnut
time
there
were
present
bishop
aethelstan
and
earl
ranig
and
edwin
the

and
leofwine
wulfsige
son
and
thurkil
the
white
and
tofi
the

came
there
on
the
king
business
and
bryning
the
sheriff
was
present
and
aethelweard
of
frome
and
leofwine
of
frome
and
godric
of
stoke
and
all
the
thegns
of
herefordshire
then
edwin
enneawnes
son
came
traveling
to
the
meeting
and
sued
his
own
mother
for
a
certain
piece
of
land
namely
wellington
and
cradley
then
the
bishop
asked
whose
business
it
was
to
answer
for
his
mother
and
thurkil
the
white
replied
that
it
was
his
business
to
do
so
if
he
knew
the
claim
as
he
did
not
know
the
claim
three
thegns
were
chosen
from
the
meeting
to
ride
to
the
place
where
she
was
namely
at
fawley
and
these
were
leofwine
of
frome
and
aethelsige
the
red
and
winsige
the
seaman
and
when
they
came
to
her
they
asked
her
what
claim
she
had
to
the
lands
for
which
her
son
was
suing
her
then
she
said
that
she
had
no
land
that
in
any
way
belonged
to
him
and
was
strongly
incensed
against
her
son
and
summoned
to
her
kinswoman
leofflaed
thurkil
wife
and
in
front
of
them
said
to
her
as
follows
sits
leofflaed
my
kinswoman
to
whom
after
my
death
i
grant
my
land
and
my
gold
my
clothing
and
my
raiment
and
all
that
i
possess
and
then
she
said
to
the
thegns
like
thegns
and
duly
announce
my
message
to
the
meeting
before
all
the
worthy
men
and
tell
them
to
whom
i
have
granted
my
land
and
all
my
property
and
not
a
thing
to
my
own
son
and
ask
them
to
be
witnesses
of
this
and
they
did
so
they
rode
to
the
meeting
and
informed
all
the
worthy
men
of
the
charge
that
she
had
laid
upon
them
then
thurkil
the
white
stood
up
in
the
meeting
and
asked
all
the
thegns
to
give
his
wife
the
lands
unreservedly
which
her
kinswoman
had
granted
her
and
they
did
so
then
thurkil
rode
to
aethelbert
minister
with
the
consent
and
cognizance
of
the
whole
assembly
and
had
it
recorded
in
a
gospel
book

this

the
complaints
and
issues
of

nobility
chapter
the
times
william
came
from
normandy
to
conquer
the
nation
he
claimed
that
the
former
king
edward
the
confessor
had
promised
the
throne
to
him
when
they
were
growing
up
together
in
normandy
if
edward
became
king
of
england
and
had
no
children
william
men
and
horses
came
in
boats
powered
by
oars
and
sails
the
conquest
did
not
take
long
because
of
the
superiority
of
his
military
expertise
to
that
of
the
english
he
organized
his
army
into
three
groups
archers
with
bows
and
arrows
horsemen
with
swords
and
stirrups
and
footmen
with
hand
weapons
each
group
played
a
specific
role
in
a
strategy
planned
in
advance
the
english
army
was
only
composed
of
footmen
with
hand
weapons
and
shields
and
was
inexperienced
declaring
the
english
who
fought
against
him
to
be
traitors
william
declared
their
land
confiscated
as
william
conquered
this
land
he
parceled
it
out
among
the
barons
who
fought
with
him
they
again
made
oaths
of
personal
loyalty
to
him
fealty
they
agreed
to
hold
the
land
as
his
vassals
with
future
military
services
to
him
and
receipt
of
his
protection
they
gave
him
homage
by
placing
their
hands
within
his
and
saying
i
become
your
man
for
the
tenement
i
hold
of
you
and
i
will
bear
you
faith
in
life
and
member
limb
and
earthly
honor
against
all
men
they
held
their
land
of
their
lord
the
king
by
service
the
king
had
enfeoffed
them
given
them
a
fief
a
source
of
income
with
land
the
theory
that
by
right
all
land
was
the
king
and
that
land
was
held
by
others
only
at
his
gift
and
in
return
for
specified
service
was
new
to
english
thought
the
saxon
governing
class
was
destroyed
the
independent
power
of
earls
who
had
been
drawn
from
three
great
family
houses
was
curtailed
most
died
or
fled
the
country
the
people
were
deprived
of
their
most
popular
leaders
who
were
excluded
from
all
positions
of
trust
and
profit
especially
the
clergy
of
all
degrees
william
was
a
stern
and
fierce
man
and
ruled
as
an
autocrat
by
terror
whenever
the
people
revolted
or
resisted
his
mandates
he
seized
their
lands
or
destroyed
the
crops
and
laid
waste
the
countryside
and
so
that
they
starved
to
death
he
had
a
strict
system
of
policing
the
nation
instead
of
the
government
throughout
the
districts
and
hundreds
of
resident
authorities
in
local
courts
he
aimed
at
substituting
for
it
the
absolute
rule
of
the
barons
under
military
rule
so
favorable
to
the
centralizing
power
of
the
crown
he
used
secret
police
and
spies
and
the
terrorism
this
system
involved
this
especially
curbed
the
minor
barons
and
preserved
the
public
peace
the
english
people
were
disarmed
curfew
bells
were
rung
at
pm
when
everyone
had
to
remain
in
their
own
dwellings
on
pain
of
death
and
all
fires
and
candles
were
to
be
put
out
this
prevented
any
nightly
gatherings
assassinations
or
seditions
order
was
brought
to
the
kingdom
so
that
no
man
dare
kill
another
no
matter
how
great
the
injury
he
had
received
william
extended
the
king
peace
on
high
roads
to
include
the
whole
nation
any
individual
of
any
rank
could
travel
from
end
to
end
of
the
land
unharmed
before
prudent
travelers
would
travel
only
in
groups
of
twenty
the
barons
subjugated
the
english
who
were
on
their
newly
acquired
land
there
began
a
hierarchy
of
seisin
rightful
occupation
of
land
so
that
there
could
be
no
land
without
its
lord
also
every
lord
had
a
superior
lord
with
the
king
as
the
overlord
or
supreme
landlord
one
piece
of
land
may
be
held
by
several
tenures
for
instance
a
holding
by
barons
service
of
the
king
may
enfeoff
b
a
church
to
hold
of
him
on
the
terms
of
praying
for
the
souls
of
his
ancestors
and
b
may
enfeoff
a
freeman
c
to
hold
of
the
church
by
giving
it
a
certain
percentage
of
his
crops
every
year
there
were
about
barons
who
held
land
directly
of
the
king
other
fighting
men
were
the
knights
who
were
tenants
or
subtenants
of
a
baron
knighthood
began
as
a
reward
for
valor
on
the
field
of
battle
by
the
king
or
a
noble
altogether
there
were
about
fighting
men
holding
land
the
essence
of
norman
feudalism
was
that
the
land
remained
under
the
lord
whatever
the
vassal
might
do
the
lord
had
the
duty
to
defend
the
vassals
on
his
land
the
vassal
owed
military
service
to
the
lord
and
also
the
service
of
attending
the
courts
of
the
hundred
and
the
shire
which
were
courts
of
the
king
administering
old
customary
law
they
were
the
king
courts
on
the
principle
that
a
crime
anywhere
was
a
breach
of
the
peace
this
feudal
bond
based
on
occupancy
of
land
rather
than
on
personal
ties
was
uniform
throughout
the
realm
no
longer
could
a
man
choose
his
lord
and
transfer
his
land
with
him
to
a
new
lord
he
held
his
land
at
the
will
of
his
lord
to
be
terminated
anytime
the
lord
decided
to
do
so
in
later
eras
tenancies
would
be
held
for
the
life
of
the
tenant
and
even
later
for
his
life
and
those
of
his
heirs
this
uniformity
of
land
organization
plus
the
new
requirement
of
every
freeman
to
take
an
oath
of
loyalty
directly
to
the
king
that
would
supersede
any
oath
to
any
other
man
gave
the
nation
a
new
unity
english
villani
bordarii
cottarii
and
servi
on
the
land
of
the
barons
were
subjugated
into
a
condition
of
villeinage
servitude
and
became
tied
to
the
land
so
that
they
could
not
leave
the
land
without
their
lord
permission
the
villeins
formed
a
new
bottom
class
as
the
population
percentage
of
slaves
declined
dramatically
they
held
their
land
of
their
lord
the
baron
to
guard
against
uprisings
of
the
conquered
people
the
barons
used
villein
labor
to
build
about
a
hundred
great
stone
castles
with
moats
and
walls
with
towers
around
them
at
easily
defensible
positions
such
as
hilltops
all
over
the
nation
a
castle
could
be
built
only
with
permission
of
the
king
a
typical
castle
had
a
stone
building
of
about
four
floors
on
a
small
steep
hill
later
it
also
had
an
open
area
surrounded
by
a
stone
wall
with
towers
at
the
corners
around
the
wall
were
ditches
and
banks
and
perhaps
a
moat
one
traveled
over
these
via
a
drawbridge
let
down
at
the
gatehouse
of
the
enclosing
wall
on
either
side
of
the
gatehouse
were
chambers
for
the
guards
arrows
could
be
shot
through
slits
in
the
enclosing
walls
inside
the
enclosed
area
might
be
stables
a
granary
barracks
for
the
soldiers
and
workshops
the
castle
building
was
entered
by
an
outer
wood
staircase
to
the
guard
room
on
the
second
floor
the
first
floor
had
a
well
and
was
used
as
a
storehouse
dungeons
for
prisoners
the
second
floor
had
a
great
hall
with
small
rooms
and
aisles
around
it
within
the
thick
walls
there
was
also
a
chapel
area
on
the
second
floor
there
were
small
areas
of
the
third
floor
which
could
be
used
for
sleeping
the
floors
were

william
was
constantly
moving
about
the

to
castle
where
he
entertained
his
magnates
and
conducted
public
business
such
as
deciding
disputes
about
holding
of
land
near
these
castles
and
other
of
his
property
he
designated
many
areas
as
royal
hunting
forests
anyone
who
killed
a
deer
in
these
forests
was
mutilated
for
instance
by
blinding
people

of
the

no
longer
go

or

wood
for

swineherds
could
no

to
eat
acorns
they
beat
down
from
oak
trees
making
clearings
and
grazing
livestock
in
the

were
prohibited
most

was
either
wooded
or

at
this
time
london
was
a
walled
town
of
one
and
two
story
houses
made
of
mud
twigs
and
straw
with
thatched
roofs
there
were
churches

were
held

walls
in
a

population
there

the
guild
of
lazarus
which
was
probably
a
leper
charity
the
pilgrims
guild
which
helped
people
going
on
pilgrimages
and
four
bridge
guilds
probably
for
keeping
the
wooden
london
bridge
in

men
told
the
time
by
sundials
some
of
which
were
portable
and
could
be
carried
in
one
pocket
london
could
defend
itself
and
a
ringing
of
the
bell
of
paul
church
could
shut
every
shop
and
fill
the
streets
with
armed
horsemen
and
soldiers
led
by
a

william
did
not
interfere
with
landholding
in
london
but
recognized
it
independence
as
a
borough
in
this
writ
william
the
king
greets
william

the

friendly

that
you

his

heir
after
his

day
and
i
will
not
suffer
any

wrong
god

so
london
was
not
subjected
to
the
norman
feudal
system
it
had
neither
villeins
nor
slaves
whenever
kings
asserted
authority
over
it
the
citizens
reacted
until
the
king
granted
a
charter
reaffirming
the
freedoms
of
the
city
and
its
independence
william
reign
was
a
time
of
tentative
expedients
and
simple
solutions
he
administered
by
issuing
writs
with
commands
or
prohibitions
these
were
read
aloud
by
the
sheriffs
in
the
county
courts
and
other
locations
administration
was
by
the
personal
servants
of
his
royal
household
such
as
the
chancellor
steward
butler
chamberlain
and
constable
the
constable
was
in
charge
of
the
knights
of
the
royal
household
under
pressure
from
the
ecclesiastical
judges
william
replaced
the
death
penalty
by
that
of
the
mutilation
of
blinding
chopping
off
hands
and
castrating
offenders
castration
was
the
punishment
for
rape
but
these
mutilations
usually
led
to
a
slow
death
by
gangrene
the
normans
used
the
concepts
of
jurisdictional
powers
thus
when
william
confirmed
customs
to
the
abbot
of
ely
these
were
understood
to
include
the
following
sac
and
soke
the
right
to

presided
over

controlled

a

caused
william
to
reinstitute

he
sent
commissioners
to
conduct
surveys
by
sworn
verdicts
of
appointed
groups
of
local

a
detailed
survey
of
land
holdings
and
the
productive
worth
of

was
made
in
the

called
it
the

because
there
was
no
appeal
from

the

william
allowed
on
an
ad

basis
certain
people
such
as
bishops
and
abbots
and
those
who
made
a
large
payment
to
have
land
disputes
decided
by
an
inquiry
of
recognitors
a
dispute
between
a
norman
and
an
english
man
over
land
or
a
criminal
act
could
be
decided
by

by
battle
each
combatant
first
swore
to
the

to
prove
by

the

of
his
cause
by
making
the
other
surrender
by
crying
craven
craving
forgiveness
the
combatants
used
weapons
like

shields
presumably
the
man
in
the
wrong
would
not
fight
as
well
because
he
was
burdened
with
a

conscience

this

was

civil
issues
were
dealt
with
by
the
hustings
court

met
every
monday
in

the

was
divided
into
wards
each
of
which
was
under
the
charge
of
an
elected
alderman
elder

this
was

a

the
aldermen
had
special
knowledge
of
the

and
a
duty
to
declare
it
at
the
hustings
court
each
alderman
also
conducted
wardmoots
in

and
decided
criminal

civil
issues
between
its

were

william
made
the
hundred
responsible
for
paying
a
murder
fine
for
the
murder
of
any
of
his
men
if
the
murderer
was
not
apprehended
by
his
lord
within
a
few
days
the
reaction
to
this
was
that
the
murderer
mutilated
the
corpse
to
make
identification
of
nationality
impossible
so
william
ordered
that
every
murder
victim
was
assumed
to
be
norman
unless
proven
english
this
began
a
court
custom
in
murder
cases
of
first
proving
the
victim
to
be
english
the
royal
court
decided
this
case
at

both
parties
were
summoned

there
sat

with
ranulf
the

and
many
other
capable

diligently
and
fully
examined
the
origin
of

delivered
judgment

ought
to
belong

made

creating
a

in

and
in
surrey
witnessed
at
westminster
the
above
right
not
to
take
part
in
any
case
outside
the
city
relieved
london
citizens
from
the
burden
of
traveling
to
wherever
the
king
court
happened
to

the

in
the
language
of
the
king
court
rather
than
in
english
the
right
of
redress
for
tolls
exacted
was
new
because
the
state
of

was
that
the
property
of
the
inhabitants
was
liable
to
the

or
superior
lord
for
the
common
debt

encouraged
the

both
looked
to

set
down

current
in
henry
own
day
the
liberi
quadripartitus
aimed
to
include
all
english
law
of
the
time
this
showed
an
awareness
of
the
ideal
of
written
law
as
a
statement
of
judicial
principles
as
well
as
of
the
practice
of
kingship
in
this
way
concepts
of
roman
law
used
by
the
normans
found
their
way
into

law
church

required
that

was
necessary
for

there

in
these
courts
on
regular
circuits
also
there
are

the
king
royal
court
heard
issues
concerning
the
crown
and
breaches
of
the

peace
which
included
almost
all
criminal
matters
the
most
serious
offenses
murder
robbery
rape
abduction
arson
treason
and
breach
of
fealty
were
now
called
felonies
other
offenses
were
housebreaking
ambush
certain
kinds
of
theft
premeditated
assault
and
harboring
outlaws
or
excommunicants
henry
personally
presided
over
hearings
of
important
legal
cases
he
punished
crime
severely
offenders
were
brought
to
justice
not
only
by
the
complaint
of
an
individual
or
local

action
but
by
official
prosecutors
a
prosecutor
was
now
at
trials
as
well
as
a
judge
trial
is
still
by
compurgation
these
offenses
against
the
king
placed
merely
personal
property
and
sometimes
land
at
the
king
mercy
thus
the
crown
increased
the
range
of
offenses
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
and
arrogated
to
itself
profits
from
the
penalties
imposed
the
royal
court
also
heard
these
offenses
against
the
king
fighting
in
his
dwelling
contempt
of
his
writs
or
commands
encompassing
the
death

henry
began
the
use
of
writs
to
intervene
in
civil
matters
these
writs
allowed
people
to
come
to
the
royal
court
on
certain
issues
he
had
some
locally
based
justices
called
justiciars
also
he
sent
justices
out
on
eyres
journeys
with
wide
responsibilities
to
hear
and
decide
all
manner
of
crown
pleas
this
brought
royal
authority
into
the
localities
and
served
to
check
baronial
power
over
the
common
people
he
created
the
office
of
chief
justiciar
which
carried
out
judicial
and
administrative
functions
the
royal
court
also
decided
land
disputes
between
barons
there
was
a
vigorous
interventionism
in
the
land

subsequent
to
appeals
to
the
king
in
tenant
relations
brought
by
a
lord
or
by
an
undertenant

those
who
sit
together

knew
relevant
facts
were
put
together
to

of
the

were
sent
with

reviewed
the

as
well
as

the

these

included

the
danegeld
land
tax
the
fines
from
local
courts
and
aid
from
baronial
estates
it
was
called
the
exchequer
because
it
used
a
chequered
cloth
on
the
table
to
facilitate
calculation
in
roman
numerals
of
the
amount
due
and
the
amount
paid
it

took
over

once
been

the

issues
which
did
not

only

this
developed
from
the
practice
of
a

usually
hearing
a
dying

as
to
the
disposition
of
his

and
chattel
when

clad
only
in
one
underwear
whippings
extra
work
fines
and
imprisonment
in
a
penitentiary
to
do
penance
the
ultimate
punishment
was
excommunication
with
social
ostracism
then
no
one
could
give
the
person
drink
food
or
shelter
and
the
only
people
he
could
speak
to
were
his
spouse
and
servants
excommunication
included
denial
of
the
sacraments
of
baptism
penance
eucharist
and
extreme
unction
at
death
which
were
necessary
for
salvation
of
the
soul
and
the
sacrament
of
confirmation
however
the
person
could
still
marry
and
make
a
will
excommunication
was
usually
imposed
for
failure
to
obey
an
order
or
showing
contempt
of
the
law
or
of
the
courts
it
required
a
due
process
hearing
and
a
written
reason
if
this
measure
failed
it
was
possible
to
turn
the
offender
over
to
the
state
for
punishment
for
blasphemy
or
heresy
blasphemy
speaking
ill
of
god
was
thought
to
cause
god
wrath
expressed
in
famine
pestilence
and
earthquake
and
was
usually
punished
by
a
fine
or
corporal
punishment
perforation
or
amputation
of
the
tongue
it
was
tacitly
understood
that
the
punishment
for
heresy
was
death
by
burning
the
state
usually
assured
itself
the
sentence
was
just
before
imposing
it
the
court
of
the
rural
dean
was
the
ecclesiastical
parallel
of
the
hundred
court
of
secular
jurisdiction
and
usually
had
the
same
land
boundaries
chapter
the
times
king
henry
ii
and
queen
eleanor
who
was
twelve
years
older
were
both
intelligent
educated
energetic
and
experienced
in
affairs
of
state
henry
was
the
first
norman
king
to
be
fully
literate
eleanor
often
served
as
regent
during
henry
reign
and
the
reigns
of
their
two
sons
richard
the
and
john
henry
ii
was
a
modest
courteous
and
patient
man
with
an
astonishing
memory
and
strong
personality
he
was
indifferent
to
rank
and
impatient
of
pomp
to
the
point
of
being
careless
about
his
appearance
he
usually
dressed
in
riding
clothes
and
was
often
unkempt
he
was
thrifty
but
generous
to
the
poor
henry
revived
and
augmented
the
laws
and
institutions
of
his
grandfather
henry
i
and
developed
them
to
a
new
perfection
almost
all
legal
and
fiscal
institutions
appear
in
their
first
effective
form
during
his
reign
for
instance
he
institutionalized
the
assize
for
a
specific
function
in
judicial
proceedings
whereas
before
it
had
been
an
ad
hoc
body
used
for
various
purposes
henry
government
practiced
a
strict
economy
and
he
never
exploited
the
growing
wealth
of
the
nation
he
abhorred
bloodshed
and
the
sacrifice
of
men
lives
so
he
strove
diligently
to
keep
the
peace
when
possible
by
gifts
of
money
but
otherwise
with
armed
force
foreign
merchants
with
precious
goods
could
journey
safely
through
the
land
from
fair
to
fair
these
fairs
were
usually
held
in
the
early
fall
after
and
harvesting
frankpledge
was
revived
no
stranger
could
stay
overnight
except
for
one
night
in
a
borough
unless
sureties
were
given
for
his
good
behavior
a
list
of
such
strangers
was
to
be
given
to
itinerant
judges
henry
had
character
and
the
foresight
to
build
up
a
centralized
system
of
government
that
would
survive
him
he
learned
about
the
shires
and
villages
varying
laws
and
customs
then
using
the
model
of
roman
law
he
gave
to
english
institutions
that
unity
and
system
which
in
their
casual
development
had
been
lacking
henry
government
and
courts
forged
permanent
direct
links
between
the
king
and
his
subjects
which
cut
through
the
feudal
structure
of
lords
and
vassals
he
developed
the
methods
and
structure
of
government
so
that
there
was
a
great
increase
in
the
scope
of
administrative
activity
without
a
concurrent
increase
of
personal
power
of
the
officials
who
discharged
it
the
government
was
regulating
with
methods
of
accounting
and
control
which
meant
that
no
official
however
exalted
could
entirely
escape
the
surveillance
of
his
colleagues
and
the
king
at
the
same
time
administrative
and
judicial
procedures
were
perfected
so
that
much
which
had
previously
required
the
king
personal
attention
was
reduced
to
routine
the
royal
household
translated
the
royal
will
into
action
in
the
early
there
had
been
very
little
machinery
of
central
government
that
was
not
closely
associated
with
the
royal
household
royal
government
was
largely
built
upon
what
had
once
been
purely
domestic
offices
kings
had
called
upon
their
chaplains
to
pen
letters
for
them
by
henry
ii
reign
the
chancery
was
a
highly
efficient
writing
office
through
which
the
king
will
was
expressed
in
a
flow
of
writs
and
the
chancellor
an
important
and
highly
rewarded
official
but
he
was
still
responsible
for
organizing
the
services
in
the
royal
chapel
similarly
the
chamberlains
ran
the
household
financial
departments
they
arranged
to
have
money
brought
in
from
a
convenient
collected
money
from
sheriffs
or
the
king
debtors
arranged
loans
with
the
usurers
and
supervised
the
spending
of
it
it
was
spent
for
daily
domestic
needs
the
king
almsgiving
and
the
mounting
of
a
military
campaign
but
they
were
still
responsible
for
personal
attendance
upon
the
king
in
his
privy
chamber
taking
care
of
his
valuable
furs
jewels
and
documents
and
changing
his
bedlinens
there
were
four
other
departments
of
the
household
the
steward
presided
over
the
hall
and
kitchens
and
was
responsible
for
supplying
the
household
and
guests
with
food
supplies
the
butler
had
duties
in
the
hall
and
cellars
and
was
responsible
for
the
supply
of
wine
and
ale
the
marshall
arranged
lodgings
for
the
court
as
it
moved
about
from
palaces
to
hunting
lodges
arranged
the
pay
of

the

arranged

and
mustered
the
royal
army
henry
brought
order
and
unity
by
making
the
king
royal
court
the
common
court
of
the
land
its
purpose
was
to
guard
the
king
peace
by
protecting
all
people
of
free
status
throughout
the
nation
and
correct
the
disparity
in
punishments
given
by
local
courts
heretofore
the
scope
of
the
king
peace
had
varied
to
as
little
as
the
king
presence
his
land
and
his
highway
the
royal
demesne
had
shrunk
to
about
of
the
land
the
common
law
for
all
the
nation
was
established
by
example
of
the
king
royal
court
a
system
of
writs
originated
actions
in
the
royal
courts
this
system
determined
the
royal
court
jurisdiction
as
against
the
church
lords
and
sheriffs
it
limited
the
jurisdiction
of
all
other
courts
and
subordinated
them
to
the
royal
court
inquests
into
any
misdeeds
of
sheriffs
were
held
which
could
result
in
their
dismissal
before
henry
reign
the
church
had
become
more
powerful
and
asserted
more
authority
henry
tried
to
return
to
the
concept
of
the
king
being
appointed
by
god
and
as
he
head
of
the
church
as
well
as
of
the
state
as
in
henry
i
time
toward
this
end
he
published
the
constitutions
of
clarendon
but
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
thomas
becket
refused
to
agree
to
them
the
disageement
came
to
a
head
in
henry
attempt
to
establish
the
principle
of
one
law
to
all
by
having
church
clerics
punished
by
the
civil
courts
as
before
instead
of
having
benefit
of
clergy
to
be
tried
only
in
ecclesiastical
courts
even
for
secular
crimes
clerics
composed
about
the
population
the
church
courts
had
characteristically
punished
with
a
fine
or
a
penance
and
at
most
defrocking
and
never
imposed
a
death
penalty
even
for
murder
when
archbishop
becket
was
murdered
and
became
a
martyr
benefit
of
clergy
became
a
standard
right
appeals
could
be
made
to
the
pope
without
the
king
permission
the
king
could
take
a
criminal
cleric
chattels
but
not
his
life
however
though
theoretically
the
bishops
were
elective
as
a
practical
matter
the
king
appointed
the
bishops
and
the
abbots
henry
and
eleanor
spoke
many
languages
and
liked
discussing
law
philosophy
and
history
so
they
gathered
wise
and
learned
man
about
them
who
became
known
as
courtiers
rather
than
people
of
social
rank
they
lived
in
the
great
and
strong
tower
of
london
which
had
been
extended
as
had
other

so
that
the
whole

were
defended
instead

london
bridge
was
built
of
stone
for
the
first
time
it
was
supported
by
a
series
of
stone
arches
standing
on
small
islands
it
had
such
a
width
that
a
row
of
wood
houses
and
a
chapel
was
built
on

of
it
in
the
spring
it
was
impassable
by

because
the

under
it
varied
in

bridge
by
several
feet
at

tide
men
began
weaving
cloth
which
formerly
had
been
done
by
women
some
of
the
cloth
was
exported
the
weavers
guild
of
london
received
a
charter
by
the
king
in
the
first
granted
to
any
london
craft
know
that
i
have
conceded
to
the
weavers
of
london
to
hold
their
guild
in
london
with
all
the
liberties
and
customs
which
they
had
in
the
time
of
king
henry
i
my
grandfather
and
that
none
may
intermeddle
with
the
craft
within
the
city
nor
in
southwark
nor
in
other
places
pertaining
to
london
except
through
them
and
except
he
be
in
their
guild
otherwise
than
was
accustomed
to
be
done
in
the
time
of
king
henry
my
grandfather
so
that
each
year
they
render
thence
to
me
two
marks
of
gold
at
the
feast
of
michael
and
i
forbid
that
any
shall
do
injury
or
contumely
to
them
on
this
account
under
penalty
of
pounds
witness
t
homas
chancellor
and
warinus
son
of
gerard
chamberlain
at
winchester
the
liberties
obtained
were
the
weavers
may
elect
bailiffs
to
supervise
the
work
of
the
craft
to
punish
defaulters
and
to
collect
the
ferm
amount
owed
to
the
king
the
bailiffs
were
chosen
from
year
to
year
and
swore
before
the
mayor
of
london
to
do
and
keep
their
office
well
and
truly
the
bailiffs
may
hold
court
from
week
to
week
on
pleas
of
debt
agreements
covenants
and
minor
trespasses
if
any
of
the
guild
members
are
sued
in
any
other
court
on
any
of
the
above
pleas
the
guild
may
challenge
that
plea
to
bring
it
to
the
guild
court
if
any
member
is
behind
in
his
share
of
the
payment
to
the
king
the
bailiffs
may
distrain
his
loom
until
he
has
paid
this
paying
an
annual
payment
freed
the
weavers
from
liability
to
inconsequent
royal
fines
failure
to
make
this
payment
promptly
might
have
led
to
loss
of
the
right
hence
the
rigorous
penalty
of
distraint
upon
the
looms
of
individual
weavers
who
fell
into
arrears
the
weavers
guild
punished
members
who
used
bad
thread
in
their
weaving
or
did
defective
weaving
by
showing
the
default
to
the
mayor
with
opportunity
for
the
workman
to
make
entreaty
and
the
mayor
and
twelve
members
of
the
guild
then
made
a
verdict
of
amercement
of
mark
and
the
workman
of
the
cloth
was
also
punished
by
the
guild
bailiffs
according
to
guild
custom
the
weavers
guild
tradition
of
brotherliness
among
members
meant
that
injury
to
a
fellow
weaver
incurred
a
severe
penalty
if
a
weaver
stole
or
eloigned
removed
them
to
a
distance
where
they
were
unreachable
any
other
weaver
goods
falsely
and
maliciously
then
he
was
dismissed
from
the
guild
and
his
loom
was
taken
by
the
guild
to
fulfill
his
portion
of
the
annual
payment
to
the
king
the
weavers
were
allowed
to
buy
and
to
sell
in
london
freely
and
quietly
they
had
all
the
rights
of
other
freemen
of
the
city
thus
from
the
middle
of
the
the
weavers
enjoyed
the
monopoly
of
their
craft
rights
of
supervision
which
ensured
a
high
standard
of
workmanship
power
to
punish
infractions
of
their
privileges
and
full
control
of
their
members
in
this
they
stand
as
the
prototype
of
english
medieval
guilds
these
rights
represented
the
standard
which
all
bodies
of
craftsmen
desired
to
attain
the
right
of
independent
jurisdiction
was
exceptional
on

who
was

yearly
by
the

wards
each

was
headed
by
an

there
were

led
to
its
replacing

as
the

it
generally
chose

elected
its

this
was
not
a

all
the

and
customs
which
they
had
in
the
time
of
king
henry
my
grandfather
and
that
they
have
their

so
that
none
carry
on
their

of
oxford
except
he
be
of
that

i
grant

who

of
the
same
guild
and
shall
have
the
same
liberties
and
customs
which
the
corvesars
have
and
ought
to
have
for
this
grant
and
confirmation
however
the
corvesars
and
cordwainers
ought
to
pay
me
every
year
an
ounce
of
gold
a
guild
merchant
for
wool
dominated
and
regulated
the
wool
trade
in
many
boroughs
in
leicester
only
guildsmen
were
permitted
to
buy
and
sell
wool
wholesale
to
whom
they
pleased
or
to
wash
their
fells
in
borough
waters
certain
properties
such
as
those
near
running
water
essential
to
the
manufacture
of
wool
were
maintained
for
the
use
of
guild
members
the
waterwheel
was
a
technological
advance
replacing
human
labor
whereby
the
cloth
was
made
more
compact
and
thick
fulled
the
waterwheel
turned
a
shaft
which
lifted
hammers
to
pound
the
wet
cloth
in
a
trough
wool
packers
and
washers
could
work
only
for
guild
members
the
guild
fixed
wages
for
instance
to
wool
wrappers
and
flock
pullers
strangers
who
brought
wool
to
the
town
for
sale
could
sell
only
to
guild
members
a
guildsman
could
not
sell
wool
retail
to
strangers
nor
go
into
partnership
with
a
man
outside
the
guild
each
guild
member
had
to
swear
the
guildsman
oath
pay
an
entrance
fee
and
subject
himself
to
the
judgment
of
the
guild
in
the
guild
court
which
could
fine
or
suspend
a
man
from
practicing
his
trade
for
a
year
the
advantages
of
guild
membership
extended
beyond
profit
in
the
wool
trade
members
were
free
from
the
tolls
that
strangers
paid
they
alone
were
free
to
sell
certain
goods
retail
they
had
the
right
to
share
in
any
bargain
made
in
the
presence
of
a
guildsman
whether
the
transaction
took
place
in
leicester
or
in
a
distant
market
in
the
general
interest
the
guild
forbade
the
use
of
false
weights
and
measures
and
the
production
of
shoddy
goods
it
maintained
a
for
weighing
wool
it
also
forbade
middlemen
from
profiting
at
the
expense
of
the
public
for
instance
wives
were
forbidden
from
buying
meat
to
sell
again
in
the
same
market
unless
they
cooked
it
the
moneys
due
to
the
king
from
the
guilds
of
a
town
were
collected
by
the
town
reeve
a
baron
could
assemble
an
army
in
a
day
to
resist
any
perceived
misgovernment
by
a
king
armed
conflict
did
not
interfere
much
with
daily
life
because
the
national
wealth
was
still
composed
mostly
of
flocks
and
herds
and
simple
buildings
machinery
furniture
and
the
stock
of
shops
were
still
sparse
life
would
be
back
to
normal
within
a
week
henry
wanted
to
check
this
power
of
the
barons
so
he
restored
the
older
obligation
of
every
freeman
to
serve
in
defense
of
the
realm
which
was
a
military
draft
at
the
king
call
barons
were
to
appear
in
mail
suit
with
sword
and
horse
knights
in
coat
of
mail
with
shield
and
lance
freeholders
with
lance
and
hauberk
coat
of
armor
burgesses
and
poorer
freemen
with
lance
and
helmet
and
such
as
millers
with
pike
and
leather
shirt
the
master
of
a
household
was
responsible
for
every
villein
in
his
household
others
had
to
form
groups
of
ten
and
swear
obedience
to
the
chief
of
the
group
this
was
implemented
in
a
war
with
france
however
the
nobility
who
were
on
the
borders
of
the
realm
had
to
maintain
their
private
armies
for
frequent
border
clashes
the
other
nobility
now
tended
towards
tournaments
with
mock
battles
between
two
sides
a
new
land
tax
replaced
the
danegeld
tax
freeholders
of
land
paid
taxes
according
to
their
plowable
land
hidage
by
the
hide
and
later
carucage
by
the
acre
it
was
assessed
and
collected
for
the
king
by
knights
with
little
or
no
remuneration
the
villein
class
which
in
theory
included
the
boroughs
paid
a
tax
based
on
their
produce
tallage
merchants
were
taxed
on
their
personal
property
which
was
determined
by
an
inquest
of
neighbors
clergy
were
also
taxed
this
new
system
of
taxation
increased
the
royal
income
about
threefold
at
the
end
of
this
period
was
the
reign
of
king
john
a
short
man
after
his
mother
eleanor
death
john
ruled
without
her
influence
he
had
a
huge
appetite
for
money
he
imposed
levies
on
the
capital
value
of
all
personal
and
moveable
goods
this
idea
was
taken
from
the
tenth
of
rents
and
income
from
moveable
goods
which
had
been
imposed
for
king
richard
ii
crusade
to
recover
jerusalem
it
began
the
occasional
subsidies
called
tenths
and
fifteenths
from
all
people
on
incomes
from
moveables
he
sold
the
wardships
of
minors
and
the
marriages
of
heiresses
to
the
highest
bidder
no
matter
how
base
he
appointed
unprincipled
men
to
be
both
sheriff
and
justice
enabling
them
to
blackmail
property
holders
with
vexatious
writs
and
false
accusations
writs
were
withheld
or
sold
at
exorbitant
prices
crushing
penalties
were
imposed
to
increase
the
profits
of
justice
the
story
of
robin
hood
portrays
john
attempt
to
gain
the
crown
prematurely
while
richard
was
on
the
crusades
to
recover
jerusalem
for
christendom
in
strong
northern
barons
refused
a
royal
demand
for
scutage
arguing
that
the
amount
was
not
within
custom
or
otherwise
justified
and
arbitrary
rule
quickly
alienated
all
sectors
of
the
population
they
joined
the
barons
to
pressure
him
to
sign
the
magna
carta
correcting
his
abuses
for
instance
since
john
had
extracted
many
heavy
fines
from
barons
by
personally
adjudging
them
blameworthy
in
disputes
with
others
the
barons
wanted
judgment
by
their
peers
under
the
established
law
of
the
courts
in
arms
the
barons
confronted
john
demanding
that
he
sign
the
magna
carta
correcting
his
abuses
which
he
did
the
law
the
peace
of
the
sheriff
still
exists
for
his
shire
the
peace
may
still
be
specially
given
but
it
will
cease
upon
the
death
of
the
king
law
required
every
good
and
lawful
man
to
be
bound
to
follow
the
hue
and
cry
when
it
was
raised
against
an
offender
who
was
fleeing
the
village
reeve
was
expected
to
lead
the
chase
to
the
boundary
of
the
next
jurisdiction
which
would
then
take
the
responsibility
to
catch
the
man
no
one
including
the
lord
of
a
manor
may
take
land
from
anyone
else
for
instance
by
the
customary
process
of
distress
without
a
judgment
from
the
royal
court
this
did
not
apply
to
london
where
a
landlord
leasing
or
renting
land
could
take
distress
in
his
fee
no
one
including
the
lord
of
a
manor
shall
deprive
an

judicial

henry
ii
wanted
all
freemen
to
be
equally
protected
by
one
system
of
law
and
government
so
he
opened
his
court
the
royal
court
to
all
people
of
free
tenure
a
court
of
five
justices
professionally
expert
in
the
law
sat
in
permanence
traveled
with
the
king
and
on
points
of
difficulty
consulted
with
him
other
professional
justices
on
eyre
journey
appeared
periodically
in
all
shires
of
the
nation
they
came
to
perform
many
tasks
besides
adjudging
civil
and
criminal
pleas
including
promulgating
and
enforcing
new
legislation
seeking
out
encroachments
on
royal
rights
reviewing
the
local
and
officials
performance
of
their
public
duties
imposing
penalties
for
failure
to
do
them
or
for

the
of
justices
in
eyre
begins
the
process
which
makes
the
custom
of
the
royal
court
the
common
law
of
the
nation
the
shire
courts
where
the
travelling
justices
heard
all
manner
of
business
in
the
shires
adopted
the
doctrines
of
the
royal
court
which
then
acquired
an
appellate
jurisdiction
the
three
royal
courts
and
justices
in
eyre
all
drew
from
the
same
small
group
of
royal
justices
henry
erected
a
basic
rational
framework
for
legal
processes
which
drew
from
tradition
but
lent
itself
to
continuous
expansion
and
adaptation
the
royal
court
was
chiefly
concerned
with
the
due
regulation
and
supervision
of
the
conduct
of
local
government
the
ownership
and
possession
of
land
held
by
free
tenure
the
repression
of
serious
crime
and
the
relations
between
the
lay
and
the
ecclesiastical
courts
the
doctrine
of
tenure
applied
universally
to
the
land
law
formed
the
basis
for
judicial
procedure
in
determining
land
rights
those
who
held
lands
in
fee
from
the
king
in
turn
subinfeudated
their
land
to
men
of
lesser
rank
the
concept
of
tenure
covered
the
earl
the
knight
knight
service
the
church
free
alms
the
tenant
who
performed
labor
services
and
the
tenant
who
paid
a

other
tenures
were
serjeanty
providing
an
implement
of

or
performing
a
nonmilitary
office
and
burgage
all
hold
the
land
of
some
lord
and
ultimately
of
the
king
henry
was
determined
to
protect
lawful
seisin
of
land
and
issued
assizes
legal
promulgations
giving
the
royal
court
authority
to
decide
land
law
issues
which
had
not
been
given
justice
in
the
shire
or
lord
court
these
included
issues
of
disseisin
ejectment
of
a
person
free
tenement
or
of
his
common
of
pasture
which
belonged
to
his
freehold
the
writ
praecipe
directed
the
sheriff
to
order
the
overlord
of
any
land
seized
to
restore
it
immediately
or
answer
for
his
failure
in
the
royal
court
though
this
petty
assize
of
disseisin
only
provided
a
swift
preliminary
action
to
protect
possession
pending
the
lengthy
and
involved
action
grand
assize
on
the
issue
of
which
party
had
the
more
just
claim
or
ultimate
right
of
seisin
the
latter
action
was
only
infrequently
invoked
the
temptation
of
a
strong
man
to
seize
a
neighbor
land
to
reap
its
profits
for
a
long
time
until
the
neighbor
could
prove
and
enforce
his
right
was
deterred
any
such
claim
of
recent
dispossession
novel
disseisin
had
to
be
made
within
three
years
of
the
disseisin
an
assize
now
a
judicial
body
of
recognition
viewed
the
land
in
question
and
answered
these
questions
of
fact
was
the
plaintiff
disseised
of
the
freeholdin
question
unjustly
and
without
judgment
did
the
defendant
commit
the
disseisin
testimony
of
a
warrantor
or
an
attorney
sent
by
him
in
his
place
or
a
charter
of
warranty
served
to
prove
seisin
by
gift
sale
or
exchange
no
pleadings
were
necessary
and
the
action
could
proceed
and
judgment
given
even
without
the
presence
of
the
defendant
the
justices
amerced
the
losing
party
with
a
monetary
penalty
a
successful
plaintiff
might
be
awarded
damages
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
revenue
eventually
royal
justices
acquired
authority
to
decide
the
ultimate
question
of
right
to
land
using
the
grand
assize
and
the
alternative
of
an
assize
instead
of
the
traditional
procedures
which
ended
in
trial
by
battle
there
was
also
a
writ
for
issues
of
inheritance
of
land
by
law
the
tenure
of
a
person
who
died
seised
of
a
tenure
in
a
demesne
which
was
hereditary
seisin
of
fee
returned
to
the
lord
who
had
to
give
it
to
the
heir
of
the
decedent
if
the
lord
refused
and
kept
it
for
himself
or
gave
it
to
someone
else
the
heir
could
sue
in
the
royal
court
which
would
decide
whether
the
ancestor
was
seised
as
of
fee
in
his
demesne
if
the
plaintiff
was
the
nearest
heir
and
whether
the
ancestor
had
died
gone
on
a
crusade
but
not
returned
or
had
become
a
monk
issues
of
seisin
were
brought
to
the
royal
court
by
a
contestant
in
a
local
court
who
put
himself
or
herself
upon
the
grand
assize
then
his
action
would
be
removed
to
the
royal
court
the
assize
would
consist
of
twelve
knights
from
the
district
who
were
elected
by
four
knights
and
who
were
known
as
truthful
men
and
who
were
likely
to
possess
knowledge
of
the
facts
the
tenant
could
object
to
any
of
the
twelve
knights
for
just
cause
as
determined
by
the
court
each
of
the
twelve
gave
an
oath
as
to
whether
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
position
was
correct
if
any
did
not
know
the
truth
of
the
matter
others
were
found
until
twelve
agreed
the
recognitors
in
favor
of
one
side
perjury
was
punished
by
forfeiture
of
all
one
goods
and
chattels
to
the
king
and
at
least
one
year
imprisonment
alternately
the
could
still
chose
trial
by
duel
a
duel
was
fought
between
the
parties
or
their
champions
the
losing
party
of
a
duel
had
to
pay
a
fine
of
however
if
the
parties
were
relatives
neither
the
assize
nor
the

was
available
to
them
but
the
matter
had
to
be
decided
by
the
law
of

nor
was

this

henry
involved
the
royal
court
in
many
criminal
issues
formerly
decided
in
the
shire
and
hundred
courts
to
detect
crimes
he
required
royal
officers
to
routinely
ask
selected
representatives
knights
or
other
landholders
of
every
neighborhood
if
any
person
were
suspected
of
any
murder
robbery
etc
a
traveling
royal
justice
or
a
sheriff
would
then
hold
an
inquest
in
which
the
representatives
answered
by
oath
what
people
were
reputed
to
have
done
certain
crimes
they
made
such
inquiries
through
assizes
of
presentment
usually
composed
of
twelve
men
from
each
hundred
and
four
men
for
each
township
these
later
evolved
into
grand
juries
these
assizes
were
an
ancient
institution
in
many
parts
of
the
country
they
consisted
of
representatives
of
the
hundreds
usually
knights
and
villages
who
testified
under
oath
to
all
crimes
committed
in
their
neighborhood
and
indicted
those
they
suspected
as
responsible
and
those
harboring
them
what
the
assize
did
was
to
insist
upon
the
adoption
of
a
standard
procedure
everywhere
systematically
the
procedure
was
made
more
regular
instead
of
depending
on
crime
waves
if
indicted
the
suspected
persons
were
then
sent
to
the
ordeal
there
was
no
trial
by
compurgation
which
was
abolished
by
henry
if
determined
guilty
he
forfeited
his
chattels
to
the
king
and
his
land
reverted
to
his
landlord
if
he
passed
the
ordeal
but
was
in
the
community
he
could
be
banished
from
the
community
later
the
ordeal
was
abolished
as
before
a
person
could
also
be
brought
to
trial
by
the
accusation
of
the
person
wronged
if
the
accused
still
denied
the
charge
after
the
accuser
testified
and
the
matter
investigated
by
inquiries
and
interrogation
and
then
analyzed
a
duel
was
held
unless
the
accuser
was
over
the

in

the

went

and
to
him
also
let
the
more
advanced
have
recourse
without
a

when
doubts
arise
in
their
faculty
there
is
to
be
one
person
in
every
chamber
where
scholars
are
resident
of
more
mature
age
than
the
others
who
is
to
make
his
report
of
their
morals
and
advancement
in
learning
to
the
warden
the
scholars
who
are
appointed
to
the
duty
of
studying
in
the
house
are
to
have
a
common
table
and
a
dress
as
nearly
alike
as
possible
the
members
of

must
all
be

together
as

as
their
leisure
serves
at
the
canonical

together
they
are
to
observe
silence
and
to
listen
to
what
is

they
must
abstain
from
noise
and
interruption
of
their

and
when
they

they
must
use
the
latin
language
a
scrutiny
shall
be
held
in
the

by
the

and
the

and
all
the
scholars
there
present
three
times
a
year
a
diligent
enquiry
is
to
be
instituted
into
the
life
conduct
morals
and
progress
in
learning
of
each
and
all
and
what
requires
correction
then
is
to
be
corrected
and
excesses
are
to
be
visited
with
condign
punishment
issues
frequently
argued
concerned
the
newly
discovered
philosophies
of
aristotle
vis
a
vis
the
accepted
christian
philosophy
aristotle
emphasized
the
intellectual
use
of
reason
as
a
road
to
understanding
whereas
the
church
had
always
taught
that
understanding
came
from
revelation
by
god
roger
bacon
an
oxford
master
applied
mathematical
knowledge
to
natural
phenomena
such
as
metal
work
mineral
work
the
making
of
weapons
agriculture
and
the
remedies
and
charms
of
wizards
and
magicians
he
studied
angles
of
reflection
in
plane
spherical
cylindrical
and
conical
mirrors
in
both
their
concave
and
convex
aspects
he
did
experiments
in
refraction
in
different
media
air
water
and
glass
and
knew
that
the
human
cornea
refracted
light
and
that
the
human
eye
lens
was
doubly
convex
however
it
was
another
years
before
the
discovery
of
the
image
on
the
retina
he
comprehended
the
magnifying
power
of
convex
lenses
and
conceptualized
the
combination
of
lenses
which
would
increase
the
power
of
vision
by
magnification
soon
afterwards
eyeglasses
were
available
to
correct
farsightedness
bacon
studied
gravity
and
the
propagation
of
force
specifically
illustrated
by
the
radiation
of
light
and
heat
he
realized
that
rays
of
light
pass
so
much
faster
than
those
of
sound
or
smell
that
the
time
is
imperceptible
to
humans
he
knew
that
rays
of
heat
and
sound
penetrate
all
matter
without
our
awareness
and
that
opaque
bodies
offered
resistance
to
passage
of
light
rays
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
science
of
physics
he
took
the
empirical
knowledge
as
to
a
few
metals
and
their
oxides
and
some
of
the
principal
alkalis
acids
and
salts
to
the
abstract
level
of
metals
as
compound
bodies
the
elements
of
which
might
be
separated
and
recomposed
and
the
general
concept
of
generation
of
liquids
gases
and
solids
which
was
the
beginning
of
the
science
of
chemistry
he
made
experiments
that
led
the
way
to
saltpeter
being
made
to
explode
which
led
the
way
to
the
formulation
of
gunpowder
he
believed
that
the
principle
of
explosive
energy
would
one
day
carry
ships
across
the
seas
without
sails
and
propel
carriages
down
the
streets
and
flying
machines
he
knew
the
power
of
parabolic
concave
mirrors
to
cause
parallel
rays
to
converge
after
reflection
to
a
focus
and
was
familiar
with
work
done
to
produce
a
mirror
that
would
induce
combustion
at
a
fixed
distance
he
studied
man
physical
nature
health
and
disease
the
beginning
of
the
science
of
biology
and
medicine
he
opined
that
the
use
of
a
talisman
was
not
to
bring
about
a
change
but
to
bring
the
patient
into
a
frame
of
mind
more
conducive
to
physical
healing
bacon
studied
different
kinds
of
plants
and
the
differences
between
arable
land
forest
land
pasture
land
and
garden
land
like
other
educated
men
of
his
day
and
those
of
the
through
the
he
believed
that
the
earth
was
the
center
of
the
universe
and
in
astrology
that
is
that
the
position
of
the
stars
and
planets
influenced
man
and
other
earthly
things
for
instance
the
position
of
the
stars
at
a
person
birth
determined
his
character
the
angle
and
therefore
potency
of
the
sun
rays
influenced
climate
temperament
and
changes
of
mortal
life
such
as
disease
and
revolutions
there
was
a
propitious
time
to
have
a
marriage
go
on
a
journey
make
war
and
take
herbal
medicine
or
be
bled
by
leeches
the
latter
of
which
was
accompanied
by
religious
ceremony
cure
was
by
god
with
medical
practitioners
only
relieving
suffering
pressure
and
binding
were
applied
to
bleeding
arrow
and
sword
wounds
to
the
skin
or
to
any
protruding
intestine
were
washed
with
warm
water
and
sewn
up
with
needle
and
silk
thread
ribs
were
spread
apart
by
a
wedge
to
remove
arrow
heads
fractured
bones
were
splinted
or
encased
in
plaster
dislocations
were
remedied
hernias
were
trussed
bladder
stones
blocking
urination
were
pushed
back
into
the
bladder
or
removed
through
an
artificial
opening
in
the
bladder
bacon
studied
the
planetary
motions
and
astronomical
tables
to
forecast
future
events
he
did
calculations
on
days
in
a
month
and
days
in
a
year
which
later
contributed
to
the
legal
definition
of
a
leap
year
he
knew
about
magnetic
poles
attracting
if
different
and
repelling
if
the
same
and
the
relation
of
magnets
poles
to
those
of
the
heavens
and
earth
he
calculated
the
circumference
of
the
world
and
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
terrestrial
positions
which
was
the
beginning
of
the
study
of
geography
he
foresaw
sailing
around
the
world
and
pointed
the
way
to
the
copernican
astronomy
which
was
founded
on
the
concept
of
the
earth
and
planets
revolving
around
the
sun
his
contribution
to
the
development
of
science
was
abstracting
the
method
of
experiment
from
the
concrete
problem
to
see
its
bearing
and
importance
as
a
universal
method
of
research
he
advocated
changing
education
to
include
studies
of
the
natural
world
using
observation
exact
measurement
and
experiments
the
making
and
selling
of
goods
diverged
as
the
cloth
merchant
severed
from
the
tailor
and
the
leather
merchant
severed
from
the
butcher
these
craftsmen
formed
themselves
into
guilds
they
sought
charters
to
require
all
craftsmen
to
belong
to
the
guild
of
their
craft
to
have
legal
control
of
the
craft
work
and
be
able
to
expel
any
craftsman
for
disobedience
these
guilds
determined
the
wages
and
working
conditions
of
the
craftsmen
and
petitioned
the
borough
authorities
for
ordinances
restraining
trade
for
instance
by
controlling
the
admission
of
outsiders
to
the
craft
preventing
foreigners
from
selling
in
the
town
except
at
fairs
limiting
purchases
of
raw
materials
to
suppliers
within
the
town
forbidding
night
work
restricting
the
number
of
apprentices
to
each
master
craftsmen
and
requiring
a
minimum
number
of
years
for
apprenticeships
in
return
these
guilds
assured
quality
control
in
some
boroughs
they
did
work
for
the
town
such
as
maintaining
certain
defensive
towers
or
walls
of
the
town
near
their
respective
wards
in
some
boroughs
fines
for
infractions
of
these
regulations
were
split
between
the
guild
and
the
government
this
jurisdiction
was
sought
from
the
towns
governments
which
were
controlled
by
the
merchant
guilds
with
great
difficulty
in
london
this
power
was
broken
in
by
the
craftsmen
forcing
their
way
into
the
by
this
brute
show
of
strength
they
set
aside
the
opinion
of
the
magnates
and
selected
their
own
candidate
to
be
mayor
the
citizens
of
london
had
a
common
seal
for
the
city
london
merchants
traveled
throughout
the
nation
with
goods
to
sell
exempt
from
tolls
most
of
the
london
aldermen
were
woolmongers
vintners
skinners
and
grocers
by
turns
or
carried
on
all
these
branches
of
commerce
at
once
there
are
three
inns
in
london
giving
hospitals
such
as
bethleham
hospital
were
established
in
london
only
tiles
were
used
for
roofing
in
london
because
wood
shingles
were
fire
hazards
and
fires
in
london
had
been
frequent
some
areas
near
london
are
disclaimed
by
the
king
to
be
royal
forest
land
so
all
citizens
could
hunt
there
and
till
their
land
there
without
interference
by
the
royal
foresters
a

four
knights
from

a

liberties
first
we

that

henry
de
bracton
a
royal
judge
and
the
last
great
ecclesiastical
lawyer
wrote
an
unfinished
treatise
a
tract
on
the
laws
and
customs
of
england
systematizing
and
organizing
the
law
of
the
court
rolls
with
definitions
and
general
concepts
and
describing
court
practice
and
procedure
it
was
influenced
by
his
knowledge
of
roman
legal
concepts
such
as
res
judicata
and
by
his
own
opinions
such
as
that
the
law
should
go
from
precedent
to
precedent
he
also
argued
that
the
will
and
intent
to
injure
was
the
essence
of
murder
so
that
neither
an
infant
nor
a
madman
should
be
held
liable
for
such
and
that
degrees
of
punishment
should
vary
with
the
level
of
moral
guilt
in
a
killing
he
thought
the
deodand
to
be
unreasonable
bracton
defines
the
requirements
of
a
valid
and
effective
gift
as
it
must
be
complete
and
absolute
free
and
uncoerced
extorted
neither
by
fear
nor
through
force
let
money
or
service
play
no
part
lest
it
fall
into
the
category
of
purchase
and
sale
for
if
money
is
involved
there
will
them
be
a
sale
and
if
service
the
remuneration
for
it
if
a
gift
is
to
be
valid
the
donor
must
be
of
full
age
for
if
a
minor
makes
a
gift
it
will
be
ineffective
since
if
he
so
wishes
it
shall
be
returned
to
him
in
its
entirety
when
he
reaches
full
age
also
let
the
donor
hold
in
his
own
name
and
not
another
otherwise
his
gift
may
be
revoked
and
let
him
at
the
least
be
of
sound
mind
and
good
memory
though
an
invalid
ill
and
on
his
death
bed
for
a
gift
make
under
such
conditions
will
be
good
if
all
the
other
requirements
of
a
valid
gift
are
met
for
no
one
provided
he
is
of
good
memory
ought
to
be
kept
from
the
administration
or
disposition
of
his
own
property
when
affected
by
infirmity
since
it
is
only
then
that
he
must
make
provision
for
his
family
his
household
and
relations
given
stipends
and
settle
his
bequests
otherwise
such
persons
might
suffer
damage
without
fault
but
since
charters
are
sometimes
fraudulently
drawn
and
gifts
falsely
taken
to
be
made
when
they
are
not
recourse
must
therefore
be
had
to
the
country
and
the
neighborhood
so
that
the
truth
may
be
declared
in
bracton
view
a
villein
could
buy
his
own
freedom
and
the
child
of
a
mixed
marriage
was
free
unless
he
was
born

king
edward
i
was
respected
by
the
people
for
his
good
government
practical
wisdom
and
genuine
concern
for
justice
for
everyone
he
loved
his
people
and
wanted
them
to
love
him
he
came
to
the
throne
with
twenty
years
experience
governing
lesser
lands
on
the
continent
which
were
given
to
him
by
his
father
henry
iii
he
gained
a
reputation
as
a
lawgiver
and
as
a
peacemaker
in
disputes
on
the
continent
he
had
close
and
solid
family
relationships
especially
with
his
father
and
with
his
wife
eleanor
to
whom
he
was
faithful
he
was
loyal
to
his
close
circle
of
good
friends
he
valued
honor
and
adhered
reasonably
well
to
the
terms
of
the
treaties
he
made
he
was
generous
in
carrying
out
the
royal
custom
of
subsidizing
the
feeding
of
paupers
he
visited
the
sick
he
dressed
in
plain
ordinary
clothes
rather
than
extravagant
or
ostentatious
ones
he
disliked
ceremony
and
display
at
his
accession
there
was
a
firm
foundation
of
a
national
law
administered
by
a
centralized
judicial
system
a
centralized
executive
and
an
organized
system
of
local
government
in
close
touch
with
both
the
judicial
and
the
executive
system
to
gain
knowledge
of
his
nation
he
sent
royal
commissioners
into
every
shire
to
ask
about
any
encroachments
on
the
king
rights
and
about
misdeeds
by
any
of
the
king
officials
sheriffs
bailiffs
or
coroners
the
results
were
compiled
as
the
hundred
rolls
they
were
the
basis
of
reforms
which
improved
justice
at
the
local
as
well
as
the
national
level
they
also
rationalized
the
array
of
jurisdictions
that
had
grown
up
with
feudal
government
statutes
were
passed
by
a
parliament
of
two
houses
that
of

and
that
of
an
elected
rather
than
appointed
commons
and
the
final
form
of
the
constitution
was
fixed
wardships
of
children
and
widows
were
sought
because
they
were
very
profitable
a
guardian
could
get
one
tenth
of
the
income
of
the
property
during
the
wardship
and
a
substantial

amount
when
the

married

into
the
royal
house
by
escheat
or
marriage
the
royal
house
employed
many
people
the
barons
developed
a
class
consciousness
of
aristocracy
and
became
leaders
of
society
many
men
no
matter
of
whom
they
held
land
sought
knighthood
the
king
granted
knighthood
by
placing
his
sword
on
the
head
of
and
moral
candidates
who
swore
an
oath
of
loyalty
to
the
king
and
to
defend
all
ladies
gentlewomen
widows
and
orphans
and
to
shun
no
adventure
of
your
person
in

wherein
you
should
happen
to
be
a
code
of

chivalry
became
recognized
such
as
telling
the
truth
and
setting
wrongs

about
half
of
the
knights
were
literate
in
the
king
issued
a

ordering
all
who
held

of
the
value
of
to
receive
knighthood
at
the

hands
at
the
royal
house
and

houses
gentlemanly
jousting
competitions
with
and

took
the

violent
tournaments
with

at
these
knights
competed
for
the
affection
of
ladies
by
jousting
with
each
other
while
the
ladies
watched
courtly
romances
were
common
if
a
man
convinced
a
lady
to
marry
him
the
marriage
ceremony
took
place
in
church
with
feasting
and
dancing
afterwards
romantic
stories
were
at
the
height
of
their
popularity
a
usual
theme
was
the
lonely
quest
of
a
knight
engaged
in
adventures
which
would
impress
his
lady
the
dress
of
the
higher
classes
was
very
changeable
and
subject
to
fashion
as
well
as

ladies
no
longer
braided
their
hair
in
long
tails
but
rolled
it

there
were

ate
off

patronized
oxford
and
cambridge
universities
and
left
bequests
to
poor
scholars
there
she
herself
had
read
aristotle
and
commentaries
thereon
and
she
especially
patronized
literature
which
would
give
perspectives
on
subjects
she
was
kind
and
thoughtful
towards
those
about
her
and
was
also
sympathetic
to
the
afflicted
and
generous
to
the
poor
she
shared
edward
career
to
a
remarkable
extent
even
accompanying
him
on
a
crusade
she
had
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
people
in
edward
official
circle
and
relied
on
the
advice
of
two
of
them
in
managing
her
lands
she
mediated
disputes
between
earls
and
other
nobility
as
well
as
softened
her

granted
her
many
wardships
and
marriages
and
she
arranged
marriages
with
political
advantages
she
dealt
with
envoys
coming
to
the
court
her
intellectual
vitality
and
organized
mentality
allowed
her
to
deal
with
arising
situations
well
edward
held
her
in
great
esteem
she
introduced
to
england
the
merino
sheep
which
when
bred
with
the
english
sheep
gave
them
a
better
quality
of
wool
she
and
edward
often
played
games
of
chess
and
backgammon
farm
efficiency
was
increased
by
the
use
of
windmills
in
the
fields
to
pump
water
and
by
allowing
villeins
their
freedom
and
hiring
them
as
laborers
only
when
needed
customary
service
was
virtually
extinct
a
man
could
earn
for
reaping
binding
and
shocking
into
a
pile
an
acre
of
wheat
a
strong
man
with
a
wife
to
do
the
binding
could
do
this
in
a
long
harvest
day
there
was
enough
grain
to
store
so
that
the
population
was
no
longer
periodically
decimated
by
famine
the
population
grew
and
all
arable
land
in
the
nation
was
under
the
plough
the
acre
was
standardized
harvests
were
usually
plentiful
with
the
exception
of
two
periods
of
famine
over
the
country
due
to
weather
conditions
then
the
price
of
wheat
went
up
and
drove
up
the
prices
of
all
other
goods
correspondingly
although
manors
needed
the
ploughmen
the
carters
and
drivers
the
herdsmen
and
the
dairymaid
on
a
basis
other
tenants
spent
increasing
time
in
crafts
and
became
village
carpenters
smiths
weavers
or
millers
assistants
trade
and
the
towns
grew
smiths
used
coal
in
their
furnaces
money
rents
often
replaced
service
due
to
a
lord
such
as
fish
silver
malt
silver
or
barley
silver
the
lord
rights
are
being
limited
to
the
rights
declared
on
the
extents
records
showing
service
due
from
each
tenant
and
the
rolls
of
the
manor
sometimes
land
is
granted
to
strangers
because
none
of
the
kindred
of
the
deceased
will
take
it
often
a
manor
court
limited
a
fee
in
land
to
certain
issue
instead
of
being
inheritable
by
all
heirs
surveyors
poles
marked
boundaries
declared
by
court
in
boundary
disputes
this
resulted
in
survey
maps
showing
villages
and
cow
pastures
the
revival
of
trade
and
the
appearance
of
a
money
economy
was
undermining
the
relationship
between
the
lord
of
the
manor
and
his
villeins
as
a
result
money
payments
were
supplementing
or
replacing
payments
in
service
and
produce
as
in
martham
where
thomas
knight
held
twelve
acres
in
villeinage
paid
for
it
and
in
special
aids
he
shall
do
sixteen
working
days
in
august
and
for
every
day
he
shall
have
one
repast
viz
bread
and
fish
he
shall
hoe
ten
days
without
the
lord
food
price
of
a
day
he
shall
cart
to
norwich
six
cartings
or
shall
give
and
he
shall
have
for
every
carting
one
leaf
and
one
lagena
or
gallon
of
ale
also
for
ditching
he
shall
make
malt
seams
of
barley
or
shall
give
also
he
shall
flail
for
twelve
days
or
give
he
shall
plough
if
he
has
his
own
plough
and
for
every
plouging
he
shall
have
three

and
nine
herrings
for
carting
manure
he

his

he

of
the

for
two

with
one
cart
with
his
own
two
oxen
the

of

he
is
to
receive
from
the

each

three
meals
at
the
value
as
above
and
thus
the
service
is
worth
clear
and
he
shall
find
one
man
for
two
days
for
mowing
the
meadow
of
the
lord
who
can
mow
by
estimation
one
acre
and
a
half
the

of
the
mowing
of
an

being
the

is
therefore
and
he
is

three

thus
that

beans
or

of

each
day
of
the

given
above

thus
the

will
lose
if
he
receives
the

thus
that
mowing
is
worth
nothing
to
the

were

with

many
new
boroughs
were
founded
as
grants
of
market
rights
by
the
king
grew
in
number
these
grants
implied
the
advantage
of
the
king
protection
in
fact
a
certain
flooded
town
was
replaced
with
a
new
town
planned
with
square
blocks
it
was
the
charter
which
distinguished
the
borough
community
from
the
other
communities
existing
in
the
country
it
invested
each
borough
with
a
distinct
character
the
privileges
which
the
charter
conferred
were
different
indifferent
places
it
might
give
trading
privileges
freedom
from
toll
a
guild
merchant
a
right
to
hold
a
fair
it
might
give
jurisdictional
privileges
a
right
to
hold
court
with
greater
or
less
franchises
it
might
given
governmental
privileges
freedom
from
the
burden
of
attending
the
hundred
and
county
courts
the
return
of
writs
which
meant
the
right
to
exclude
the
royal
officials
the
right
to
take
the
profits
of
the
borough
paying
for
them
a
fixed
sum
to
the
crown
or
other
lord
of
the
borough
the
right
to
elect
their
own
officials
rather
than
them
being
appointed
by
the
king
or
a
lord
and
the
right
to
provide
for
the
government
of
the
borough
it
might
give
tenurial
privileges
the
power
to
make
a
will
of
lands
or
freedom
from
the
right
of
a
lord
to
control
his
tenants
marriages
it
might
give
procedural
privileges
trial
by
battle
is
excluded
and
trial
by
compurgation
is
secured
and
regulated
these
medieval
borough
charters
are
very
varied
and
represent
all
stages
of
development
and
all
grades
of
franchise
boroughs
bought
increasing
rights
and
freedoms
from
their
lord
who
was
usually
the
king
in
the
larger
towns
where
cathedrals
and
public
building
were
built
there
arose
a
system
for
teaching
these
technical
skills
and
elaborate
handicraft
wood
metal
stained
glass
and
stone
work
some
churches
now
had
windows
a
boy
from
the
town
would
be
bound
over
in
apprenticeship
to
a
particular
craftsman
who
supplied
him
with
board
and
clothing
the
craftsman
might
also
employ
men
for
just
a
day
these
journeymen
were
not
part
of
the
craftsman
household
as
was
the
apprentice
after
a
few
years
of
an
apprenticeship
one
became
a
journeyman
and
perfected
his
knowledge
of
his
craft
and
its
standards
by
seeing
different
methods
and
results
in
various
towns
he
was
admitted
as
a
master
of
his
trade
to
a
guild
upon
presenting
an
article
of
his
work
worthy
of
that
standard
of
workmanship
his
masterpiece
the
tailors
guild
and
the
skinners
guild
are
extant
now
when
guilds
performed
morality
plays
based
on
bible
stories
at
town
festivals
there
was
usually
a
tie
between
the
bible
story
and
the
guild
craft
for
instance
the
story
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
would
be
performed
by
the
bakers
or
fishmongers
guild
the
theme
of
the
morality
play
was
the
fight
of
the
seven
cardinal
virtues
against
the
seven
deadly
sins
for
the
human
soul
a
battle
a
borough
was
run
by
a
mayor
elected
usually
for
life
by
being
members
of
a
guild
and
craftsmen
acquired
the
legal
status
of
burgesses
and
had
the
freedom
of
the
borough
each
guild
occupied
a
certain
ward
of
the
town
headed
by
an
alderman
the
town
aldermen
made
up
the
town
council
which
advised
the
mayor
often
there
were
town
police
bailiffs
beadles
messengers
a
town
cryer
and
a
town
clerk
in
the
center
of
town
were
the
fine
stone
houses
a
guildhall
with
a
and
the
marketplace
a
square
or
broad
street
where
the
town
cryer
made
public
announcements
with
bell
or
horn
here
too
was
the
duckingstool
for
scandalmongers
and
the
stocks
which
held
offenders
by
their
legs
and
perhaps
their
hands
to
be
scorned
and
pelted
by
bystanders
with
for
instance
rotten
fruit
and
filth
no
longer
were
towns
dominated
by
the
local
landholders
in
london
by
this
time
there
was
a
wall
with
four
towers
surrounding
the
white
tower
and
this
castle
was
known
as
the

to
repair
and
clean
the

time
included
a

the

at
this
time
besides
the

the

to
elect
a
properly
qualified
governing
body
to
superintend
its

and
reform

of
just
complaint
it
also
prescribed
as
a
safeguard
against
a
prevailing
fraud
and
abuse
that
all
members
of
the

should
have
their
standing
in

there
was
a
problem
with
malefactors
committing
offenses
in
london
and
avoiding
its
jurisdiction
by
escaping
to
southwark
across
the

river
so
southwark
was
put

the
jurisdiction
of
london
for
peace
and
order
matters
by
grant
of
the
king
london
forbade
games
being
played
because
they
had
replaced

which
was
necessary
for
defense
exports
and
imports
were
no
longer
a
tiny
margin
in
an
economy
just
above
the
subsistence
level
exports
were
primarily
raw
wool
and

also

and
a
carrying

many
duties
of
sheriffs
and
coroners
were
transferred
to
county
landholders
by

there
were
such

circumstances
some
tenants
holding

in
chief
of
the
king
were
women
regulation
of
trade
became
national
instead
of
local
trade
was
relatively
free
almost
the
only
internal
transportation
tolls
were
petty
portages
and
viages
levied
to
recoup
the
expense
of
a
bridge
or
road
which
had
been
built
by
private
enterprise
responsibility
for
the
coinage
was
transferred
from
the
individual
moneyers
working
in
different
boroughs
to
a
central
official
who
was
to
become
master
of
the
mint
the
round
half
penny
and
farthing
penny
were
created
so
that
the

need
be
cut
into

anymore
edward
called
meetings
of
representatives
from
all
social
and
geographic
sectors
of
the
nation
at
one
parliament
to
determine
taxes
due
to
the
crown
he
declared
that
what
touches
all
should
be
approved
by
all
he
wanted
taxes
from
the
burgesses
in
the
towns
and
the
clergy
ecclesiastical
property
as
well
as
from
landholders
he
argued
to
the
clergy
that
if
barons
had
to
both
fight
and
pay
they
who
could
do
no
fighting
must
at
least
pay
and
compelled
them
to
renounce
all
papal
orders
contrary
to
the
king
authority
he
offered
to
give
up
the
royal
right
to
tax
merchandise
for
a
new
tax
customs
on
exports
he
got
an
agreement
for
an
aid
of
on
other
moveables
this
new
system
of
taxation
began
the
decline
of
the
imposition
of
feudal
aids
scutages
and
carucage
the
aids
of
the
boroughs
counties
and
church
had
been
negotiated
by
the
exchequer
with
the
reeves
of
each
town
the
sheriff
and
shire
courts
of
each
county
and
the
archdeacons
of
each
diocese
the
area
under
a
bishop
control
this
model
parliament
of
was
composed
of
the
three
communities
the
first
were
the
lords
because
of
the
increase
of
lesser
barons
due
to
a
long
national
peace
and
prosperity
the
lords
attending
were
reduced
in
numbers
and
peerage
became
dependent
not
on
land
tenure
but
on
royal
writ
of
summons
the
second
community
was
the
clergy
represented
by
the
bishops
of
each
diocese
they
later
declined
to
attend
the
third
community
was
the
commons
it
was
composed
of
two
burgesses
elected
by
principal
burgesses
of
each
borough
and
two
elected
knights
representing
each
county
the
common
people
now
had
a
voice
in
the
first
legislation
proposed
by
the
commons
was
alteration
of
the
forest
laws
governing
the
royal
pleasure
parks
such
a
statute
was
passed
in
a
bargain
for
taxes
of
a
percentage
of
all
moveables
which
were
mostly
foodstuffs
and
animals
parliament
soon
was
required
to
meet
once
or
twice
yearly
lawmaking
is
now
a
function
of
parliament
of
which
the
council
is
a
part
instead
of
a
function
of
the
king
with
his
council
and
judges
however
legislation
may
be
passed
without
the
consent
of
the
commons
also
there
was
no
convention
that
agreement
or
even
the
presence
of
representatives
was
required
for
legislation
the
idea
that
the
present
can
bind
the
absent
and
that
the
majority
of
those
present
to
outvote
the
minority
was
beginning
to
take
hold
the
chief
justices
still
had
as
members
of
the
council
a
real
voice
in
the
making
of
laws
the
king
and
his
justices
might
after
a
statute
has
been
made
put
an
authoritative
interpretation
upon
it
most
petitions
to
parliament
were
private
grievances
of
individuals
including
people
of
no
social
rank
such
as
prisoners
other
petitions
were
from
communities
and
groups
in
edward
i
confirmed
the
magna
carta
and
other
items
judgments
contrary
to
magna
carta
were
nullified
the
documents
were
to
be
read
in
cathedral
churches
as
grants
of
edward
and
all
violators
were
to
be
excommunicated
he
also
agreed
not
to
impose
taxes
without
the
consent
of
parliament
after
baronial
pressure
had
forced
him
to
retreat
from
trying
to
increase
for
a
war
in
france
the
customs
tax
on
every
exported
sack
of
wool
to
from
the
per
sack
it
had
been
since
the
customs
tax
was
finally
fixed
at
for
every
sack
of
wool
for
each
tun
of
wine
and
for
every
pound
worth
of
other
goods
a
tax
system
of
tenths
and
fifteenths
levied
on
income
from
moveables
or
chattels
every
year
also
came
into
being
this
most
affected
the
goods
made
and
sold
in
the
towns
so
that
both
town
and
countryside
were
taxed
about
the
same
never
again
did
a
king
impose
a
tax
without
the
consent
of
parliament
edward
also
confirmed
the
forest
charter
which
called
for
its
earlier
boundaries
and
he
agreed
not
to
impound
any
grain
or
wool
or
and
like
against
the
will
of
the
owners
as
had
been
done
before
to
collect
taxes
also
the
special
prises
or
requisitions
of
goods
for
national
emergency
were
not
to
be
a
precedent
lastly
he
agreed
not
to
impose
penalties
on
two
earls
and
their
supporters
for
refusing
to
serve
in
the
war
in
france
the
export
of
wool
had
increased
and
parliament
initiated
customs
duties
of
on
every
sack
of
wool
woolfells
sheepskin
with
wool
still
on
it
or
skins
exported
which
was
collected
at
each
of
the
thirteen
ports
the
beginning
of
the
staple
depot
system
imports
of
wine
were
taxed
as
tonnage
as
before
sheriffs
were
elected
in
their
own
counties
rather
than
appointed
by
the
king
as

now
drawn
from
the
knightly
class
instead
of
ecclesiastical
people
law

longer

where
confidential

such
as

were
discussed
in
his

the
people
in
the
entourage
rode
horses
or
walked
the
other
two
specialized
administrative
bodies
were
the
exchequer
which
received
most
of
the
royal
revenue
and
kept
accounts
at
westminster
in
london
and
the
chancery
which

royal
writs
charters
and
letters
as

prohibited
as
was
the
export
of
unwoven

later
this
was
relaxed
and
a
customs
tax
of

imposed
on
wool
exported
foreign

granted
franchises
and

the
protection
no
cloth
may
be
exported
until
it
is
fulled
there
was
a
recoinage
due
to
debasement
of
the
old
coinage
this
increased
the
number
of
coins
in
circulation
the
price
of
wheat
went
from
about
in
to
about
per
quarter
in
also
the
price
of
an
ox
went
from
to
from
to
there
was
runaway
inflation
as
before
inadequate
care
and
ignorance
of
nutrition
caused
many
infant
deaths
accidents
and
disease
were
so
prevalent
that
death
was
always
near
and
life
insecure
many
women
died
in
childbirth
in
the
there
were
extremes
of
fashion
in
men
and
clothing
including
tight
garments
pendant
sleeves
down
to
the
ground
coats
so
short
they
did
reach
the
hips
or
so
long
they
reached
the
heels
hoods
so
small
they
could
cover
the
head
and
shoes
with
long
curved
peaks
like
claws
at
the
toes
both
men
and
women
wore
belts
low
on
the
hips
the
skirt
of
a
lady
tunic
was
fuller
and
the
bodice
more
closely
fitted
than
before
her
hair
was
usually
elaborately
done
up
with
long
curls
or
curled
braids
on
either
side
of
the
face
a
jeweled
circlet
was
often
worn
around
her

ladies
wore
on
their

cloth
handbags
which
usually
contained
toiletries
such
as
combs
made
of
ivory
horn
bone
or
wood
and
perhaps
a
little
book
of
devotions
a
man
wore
a

and
a

on
his

some
women
painted
their

colored
their

there
were

kept

purely
as
pets
under
edward
ii
all
citizens
of
london
had
to
be
enrolled
in
the
trade
guild
of
their
craft
the
commons
became
a
permanent
and
distinct
body
with
an
elected
spokesman
or
speaker
and
its
own
clerk
in
edward
iii
reign
also
sheriffs
them
dealt
directly
with
the
king
instead
of
through
an
earl
to
support
a
war
with
france
edward
iii
permanently
instituted
the
staple
system
by
which
wool
exports
were
taxed
through
his
officials
only
at
the
designated
staple
port
these
officials
included
collectors
controllers
searchers
surveyors
clerks
weighers
and
certain
large
wool
merchants
were
allowed
to
create
a
monopoly
on
the
export
of
wool
also
under
edward
iii
flanders
weavers
were
encouraged
to
come
to
england
to
teach
the
english
how
to
weave
and
finish
fine
cloth
a
cloth
industry
grew
with
all
the
manufacturing
processes
under
the
supervision
of
one
capitalist
manufacturer
who
set
up
his
enterprise
in
the
country
to
avoid
the
regulations
of
the
towns
the
best
places
were
hilly
areas
where
there
were
many
streams
and
good
pasture
for
flocks
of
sheep
he
hired
shearers
to
cut
the
nap
as
short
as
possible
to
give
a
smooth
surface
then
spinsters
to
card
and
spin
the
wool
in
their
country
cottages
then
weavers
and
then
fullers
and
dyers
to
come
to
fulling
mills
established
near
streams
for
their
waterpower
fulling
became
mechanized
as
heavy
wooden
hammers
run
by
replaced
feet
trampling
the
cloth
covered
with
soap
or
fuller
clay
until
it
became
thick
and
smaller
the
shaft
loom
was
a
technological
advance
in
weaving
this
loom
was
horizontal
and
its
frames
which
controlled
the
lifting
of
the
warp
threads
could
each
be
raised
by
a
foot
treadle
this
left
both
hands
free
to
throw
and
catch
the
shuttle
attached
to
the
woof
thread
also
many
more
weaving
patterns
became
possible
through
the
use
of
different
thread
configurations
on
the
frames
the
law
edward
i
remodeled
the
law
in
response
to
grievances
and
to
problems
which
came
up
in
the
courts
the
changes
improved
the
efficiency
of
justice
and
served
to
accommodate
it
to
the
changing
circumstances
of
the
social

the

this
halted

as
incidents

relief
escheat
wardship

one

will
descend
in

down

line
of

prescribed
in

original
gift
as
long
as
that
line
should
last
instead
of
descending
to
all
heirs
the
successive
occupants
might
draw
the
rents
and
cut
the

but
on
the
death
of

would
take
possession

there
was
no

it
reverted

this
curtailed
the
advantage
of

of
the
greater

who
profited
by

never

arisen

the
first
author
of
the
tale
a
system
of
registration
and
enforcement
of
commercial
agreements
was
established
by
statute
merchants
could
obtain
a
writing
of
a
debt
sealed
by
the
debtor
and
authenticated
by
royal
seal
or
a
seal
of
a
mayor
of
certain
towns
and
kept
by
the
creditor
failure
to
pay
a
such
a
debt
was
punishable
by
imprisonment
and
after
three
months
the
selling
of
borough
tenements
and
chattels
and
of
shire
lands
during
the
three
months
the
merchant
held
this
property
in
a
new
tenure
of
statute
merchant
prior
to
this
it
was
difficult
for
a
foreign
merchant
to
collect
a
debt
because
he
could
not
appear
in
court
which
did
not
recognize
him
as
one
of
its
proper
suitors
or
constituents
so
he
had
to
trust
a
local
attorney
also
the
remedy
was
inadequate
because
the
history
of
the
law
of
debt
was
based
on
debt
as
a
substitute
for
the
blood
feud
so
that
failure
to
pay
meant
slavery
or
death
also
a
debtor
land
was
protected
by
feudal
custom
which
was
contrary
to
the
idea
of
imposing
a
new
tenant
on
a
lord
in
no
city
borough
town
market
or
fair
shall
a

of

amerced
to
the
king
no
market
town
shall
take
an
outrageous
toll
contrary
to
the
common
custom
of
the
nation
since

been
counterfeited
with

outside
the

and
then
brought

found
in

ports
with
this
false

shall
forfeit
their

anyone
bringing
foreign
money
into
the

must
have
it
examined
at

made
only
by

by

was

maximum

allowed

to

each

has
its
own
civil
and
criminal
ordinances
and

jurisdiction
borough
courts
tended
to
deal
with
more
laws
than
other
local

because
of
the
borough
denser
populations
which
were
composed
of
merchants
manufacturers

as

as
those
engaged

the

jurisdiction
in

was
organized
upon
the

model
as
in
the

at

and
was
controlled
by
the
king

upon
similar
principles
though
there
are
some
survivals
of
old
rules
such
as

committed
are
similar
to
those
of

encroachments
upon

obstructions
of

of

the
most
striking
difference
with

they

to

were
many

everyone
who
held

this
applied
to
every

he
had
to

on

each

paid
a

to
the

in
the
manor
courts
actions
of
debt
detinue
and
covenant
were
frequent
sometimes
there
are
questions
of
a
breach
of
warranty
of
title
in
agreements
of
sale
of
land
accusations
of
defamation
were
frequent
this
offense
could
not
be
taken
to
the
king
court
but
it
had
been
recognized
as
an
offense
in
the
laws
in
some
cases
the
damages
caused
are
specifically
stated
for
instance
defamation
of
a
lord
grain
cause
other
purchasers
to
forbear
buying
it
there
are
frequent
cases
of
ordinary
thefts
trespasses
and
assaults
the
courts
did
rough
but
substantial
justice
without
distinction
between
concepts
such
as
tort
and
contract
in
fact
the
action
of
covenant
was
the
only
form
of
agreement
enforceable
at
common
law
it
required
a
writing
under
seal
and
awarded
damages
their
law
was
not
technical
but
elastic
and
remedies
could
include
injunctions
salary
attachment
and
performance
of
acts
the
precedent
for
punishment
for
treason
was
established
by
the
conviction
of
a
knight
david
ab
gruffydd
who
had
turned
traitor
to
the
welsh
enemy
during
the
conquest
of
wales
and
plotted
to
kill
the
king
he
was
condemned
to
be
dragged
at
the
heels
of
horses
for
being
a
traitor
to
his
knightly
vows
hanged
by
the
neck
for
his
murders
cut
down
before
consciousness
left
him
to
have
his
entrails
cut
out
for
committing
his
crimes
during
the
holy
week
of
easter
and
his
head
cut
off
and
his
body
divided
into
four
parts
for
plotting
against
the
life
the
head
and
body
sections
were
placed
in
public
view
at
various
locations
in
the

prior
to
this

a

class
of
temporal
lawyers
is
prominent
in

they
were
educated

certified
at

some
are

by

tend
to
be
recruited
from
among
those
who
had
passed
their
lives
practicing
law
in
court
instead
of
from
the
ecclesiastical
orders
men
learned
all
lawyers
were
brought
under
the
control
of
the
judges
there
are
two
types
of
attorneys
one
appears
in
the
place
of
his
principal
who
does
not
appear
the
appointment
of
such
an
attorney
is
an
unusual
and
a
solemn
thing
only
to
be
allowed
on
special
grounds
and
with
the
proper
formalities
for
instance
a
poor
person
may
not
be
able
to
afford
to
travel
to
attend
the
royal
court
in
person
the
other
type
of
attorney
accompanies
his
client
to
court
and
advocates
his
position
with
his
knowledge
of
the
law
and
his
persuasiveness
the
great
litigation
of
the
nation
is
conducted
by
a
small
group
of
men
as
is
indicated
by
the
earliest
year
books
of
case
decisions
they
sit
in
court
and
one
will
sometimes
intervene
as
amicus
curiae
friends
of
the
court
parliament
refers
difficult
points
of
law
to
them
as
well
as
to
the
judges
in
the
city
of
london
made
regulations
for
the
admission
of
both
types
of
attorneys
to
practice
before
the
civic
courts
and
for
their
due
control
in
the
king
directed
the
judges
to
provide
a
certain
number
of
attorneys
and
apprentices
to
follow
the
court
who
should
have
the
exclusive
right
of
practicing
before
it
this
begins
the
process
which
will
make
the
attorney
for
legal
business
an
officer
of
the
court
which
has
appointed
him
because
the
common
law
and
its
procedures
have
become
technical
and
rigid
the
chancery
was
given
equity
jurisdiction
by
statute
in
in
chancery
if
there
is
a
case
with
no
remedy
specified
in
the
law
that
is
similar
to
a
case
for
which
there
is
a
writ
then
a
new
writ
may
be
made
for
that
case
these
were
called
actions
on
the
case
this
added
to
chancery
work
of
now
hearing
petitions
of
misconduct
of
government
officials
or
of
powerful
oppressors
wardship
of
infants
dower

the

tried

avoid
the

by

so
many
good

caused
some
question
their

also
it

were
less
likely
to
die
than
priests
who
stayed
with
the

the

thus
begins
a
long
period
of

did
not
go
up
nearly
as
much
the
villeins
had
become
nomadic
roaming
from
place
to
place
seeking
day
work
for
good
wages
where
they
could
get
it
and
resorting
to
thievery
on

among

they
spread
political

among

anon
as
so
for
to

groups
of
armed
men
took
lands
manors
goods
and
women
by

the
villeins
agreed
to
assist
each
other
in
resisting
by
force
their
lords
efforts
to
return
them
to
servitude
justices
became
afraid
to
administer
the
law
villeins
free
peasants
and
craftsmen
joined
together
and
learned
to
use
the
tactics
of
association
and
strikes
against
their
employers
the
office
of
justice
of
the
peace
was
created
for
every
county
to
deal
with
rioting
and
vagrants
cooperation
by
officials
of
other
counties
was
mandated
to
deal
with
fugitives
from
its
justice
when
there
were
attempts
to
enforce
the
legal
servitude
of
the
villeins
they
spread
rhymes
of
their
condition
and
need
to
revolt
a
secret
league
called
the
great
society
linked
the
centers
of
intrigue
a
poll
tax
for
a
war
with
france
touched
off
a
riot
all
over
the
nation
in
this
tax
included
people
not
taxed
before
such
as
laborers
the
village
smith
and
the
village
tiler
by
this
time
the
black
death
had
reduced
the
population
from
million
to
million
it
was
to
rise
to
million
by
mobs
overran
the
counties
around
london
the
upper
classes
fled
to
the
woods
but
the
chief
justice
was
murdered
while
fleeing
written
records
of
the
servitude
of
villeins
were
burned
in
their
halls
which
were
also
looted
prisoners
were
released
from
jails
the
archbishop
who
was
a
notoriously
exploitive
landlord
and
the
treasurer
were
beheaded
on
tower
hill
and
their
heads
were
posted
over
london
bridge
the
villeins
demanded
that
service
to
a
lord
be
by
agreement
instead
of
by
servitude
a
ceiling
on
rents
of
per
acre
yearly
abolition
of
a
right
for
their
work
on

just
before
a
hail
storm
so
only
his
crops
were
saved
and
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
the
revolt
was
suppressed
and
its
leaders
punished
also
the
duty
to
deal
with
rioting
and
vagrants
was
given
to
royal
judges
sheriffs
mayors
bailiffs
and
constables
as
well
as
the
justices
of
the
peace
there
was
a
high
constable
in
each
hundred
and
a
petty
constable
in
each
parish
justices
of
the
peace
could
swear
in
neighbors
as
unpaid
special
constables
when
disorder
broke
out
the
sheriff
was
responsible
for
seeing
that
men
of
the
lower
classes
were
organized
into
groups
of
ten
for
police
and
surety
purposes
and
for
holding
of
hundred
and
shire
courts
arresting
suspects
guarding
prisoners
awaiting
trial
carrying
out
the
penalties
adjudged
by
the
courts
and
collecting
crown
revenue
through
his
bailiffs
royal
writs
were
addressed
to
the
sheriff
because
many
sheriffs
had
taken
fines
and
ransoms
for
their
own
use
a
term
limit
of
one
year
was
imposed
sheriffs
hundreders
and
bailiffs
had
to
have
lands
in
the
same
shires
or
bailiwicks
so
they
could
be
held
answerable
to
the
king
efforts
were
made
to
keep
laborers
at
the
plough
and
cart
rather
than
learn
a
craft
or
entering
and
being
educated
by
the
church
the
new
colleges
at
the
universities
ceased
to
accept
villeins
as
students
due
to
the
shortage
of
labor
landlords
returns
had
decreased
from
about
to
but
some
found
new
methods
of
using
land
that
were
more
profitable
than
the
customary
services
of
villeins
who
had
holdings
of
land
or
the
paid
labor
of
practically
free
men
who
paid
a
money
rent
for
land
holdings
one
method
was
to
turn
the
land
to
others
leased
their
demesne
land
which
transferred
the
burden
of
getting
laborers
from
the
landlord
to
the
tenant
the
payment
was
called
a
farm
and
the
tenant
a
farmer
first
there
were
leases
in
which
both
the
land
and
everything
required
to
cultivate
it
were
let
together
after
years
when
the
farmers
had
acquired
assets
there
were
pure
land
leases
the
commutation
of
labor
services
into
a
money
payment
developed
into
a
general
commutation
of
all
services
lords
in
need
of
money
gladly
sold
manumissions
to
their
villeins
the
lord
and
lady
of
some
manors
now
ate
by
themselves
in
a
private
parlor
with
a
fireplace
of
its
own
and
the
great
hall
was
deserted
some
farmers
achieved
enough
wealth
to
employ
others
as
laborers
on
their
farms
the
laborers
lived
with
their
employer
in
his
barn
sleeping
on
hay
in
the
loft
or
in
mud
huts
outside
the
barn
the
farmer
family
lived
at
one
end
of
the
barn
around
an
open

to
have
a
wooden
bedstead
hens
geese
pigs
a
couple
of
cows
a
couple
of
sheep
or
two
plow
oxen
they
ate
dark
bread
and
beans
and
drank
water
from
springs
milk
and
cheese
were
a
luxury
for
them

still
occupied
the
vast

of
the

in
it
rinsing
with
a
splash
of
warm
water
and
drying
off
with
a

into
use
there
were
hung
around

mirrors
of

and
salt
cellars
the
first
meal
of
the
day
was
breakfast
which
broke
the
fast
lasting
the
night
meals
were
often
prepared
according
to
recipes
from
cook
books
which
involved
several
preparation
procedures
using
flour
eggs
sugar
cheese
and
grated
bread
rather
than
just
simple
seasoning
menus
were
put
together
with
foods
that
tasted
well
together
and
served
on
plates
in
several
courses

came
from

an

was
required
to
buy
his
right
to
trade
either
by
way
of
a
seven
year
apprenticeship
or
by
payment
of
an
entry
fee
to

he
needed
both
a
skill
and
social
respectability
towns

after
the
experience
of
the

some
sanitary
measures
were
taken

notorious
offenders
in
matters
of
public
hygiene
in
the
towns
such
as
the
butchers
the
fishmongers
and
the
leather
tanners
were
assigned
specific
localities
where
their
trades
would
do
least
harm
the
smiths
and
potters
were
excluded
from
the
more
densely
populated

at

houses
whether
the

were
built
into
the

or
as

also
in

there
grew
a
practice
of
carting
human

to

perpetual
existence
as
such

could
hold

in
all

the
organization
of

spread
rapidly
downwards
through
the

gaining
much
power
relative
to
the
old
merchant
guilds
in
governing
the
towns
the
greater
crafts
such
as
the
fishmongers
skinners
and
the

authorities
as

still
itinerant
going
to
sites
of
churches
public
buildings
or
commanded
by
the
king
to
work
on
castles
the
guild
was
not

on

were

the

of

were
adjusted
in
and
began
the

william

was
the

the

was
civil

with

that
were
made
theology
and
the

the

were

many

instead

were
now
appointed
to
the

of
state
parliament
was
composed
of
representatives
from
boroughs
and
shires
merchants
were
entering
parliament
and
paid
much
of
the
taxes
some
were
created
earls
and
appointed
as
ministers
to
the
king
edward
iii
did
not
summon
anyone
to
his
council
who
did
not
have
the
confidence
of
the
magnates
barons
earls
bishops
and
abbots
under
him
the
commons
took
a
leading
part
in
the
granting
of
taxes
and
the
presentation
of
petitions
at
the
parliament
the
good
parliament
the
commons
which
formerly
had
only
consented
to
taxes
took
political
action
by
complaining
that
the
king
councilors
had
grown
rich
by
war
profiteering
at
the
cost
of
impoverishing
the
nation
and
the
people
were
too
poor
to
endure
any
more
taxation
for
the
war
and
held
a
hearing
on
malfeasance
of
two
ministers
the
parliament
found
the
charges
proved
and
dismissed
them
from
office
this
established
the
constitutional
means
for
impeachment
and
removal
of
ministers
the
commons
demanded
that
its
members
be
elected
by
shire
citizens
rather
than
appointed
by
the
sheriff
actions
of
this
parliament
were
undone
a
few
months
later
king
richard
ii
exiled
henry
of
lancaster
forbade
his
inheritance
and
took
his
property
this
made
all
propertied
men
anxious
the
merciless
parliament
of
swept
out
king
richard
ii
friends
parliament
threw
richard
ii
into
prison
and
elected
lancaster
to
be
king
henry
iv
this
action
established
clearly
that
royal
decrees
were
subordinate
to
parliamentary
statutes
the
house
of
commons
became
very
powerful
so
the
roles
of
parliament
and
the
king
council
are
starting
to
differentiate
into
legislative
and
executive
respectively
the
legislative
function
is
making
and
the
executive
is
that
refines
and
effectuates
the
laws
of
parliament
but
the
legislative
executive
and
judicial
authorities
have
not
as
yet
become
so
completely
separated
that
they
can
not
on
occasion
work
together
there
was
a
standard
form
of
direct
taxation
voted
by
parliament
which
was
normally
of
the
value
of
all
moveables
in
towns
and
royal
domains
and
in
the
country
from
to
resistance
was
an
ordinary
remedy
for
political
disagreements
if
a
popular
leader
raised
his
standard
in
a
popular
cause
an
irregular
army
could
be
assembled
in
a
day
there
was
no
regular
army
since
england
was
protected
by
the
sea
from
invasion
so
misgovernment
by
a
king
would
be
quickly
restrained
society
recovered
quickly
from
conflict
and
civil
war
because
the
national
wealth
consisted
chiefly
in
flocks
and
herds
and
in
the
simple
buildings
inhabited
by
the
people
in
a
week
after
armed
resistance
the
agricultural
worker
was
driving
his
team
there
was
little
furniture
stock
of
shops
manufactured
goods
or
machinery
that
could
be
destroyed
the
feudal
army
was
summoned
for
the
last
time
in
the
year
war
with
france
which
began
in
in
it
the
english
longbow
was
used
to
pierce
french
knights
armor
guns
and
cannon
with
gunpowder
were
introduced
in
they
became
common
by
and
foresaw
the
end
to
the
competition
between
the
strength
of
arrows
to
pierce
and
the
heaviness
of
armor
to
resist
featherbeds
and
blooded
horses
were
favorite
spoils
of
war
brought
back
to
england
in
th
and
the
king
relied
on
mercenaries
hired
directly
or
by
contract
with
his
great
nobles
for
foreign
wars
many
lords
got
men
to
fight
with
them
by
livery
and
maintenance
employment
agreements
such
as
this
one
of

the

adjourned
for

from
hilary
to
easter
chapter
the
times
this
period
which
begins
with
the
reign
of
the
usurper
king
henry
iv
is
dominated
by
war
the
last
half
of
the
year
war
with
france
which
with
the
help
of
joan
of
arc
took
all
english
land
on
the
continent
except
the
port
of
calais
and
the
war
of
the
roses
in
england
the
barons
and
earls
returned
from
france
with
their
private
fighting
units
nobles
employed
men
who
had
returned
from
fighting
to
use
their
fighting
skill
in
local
defense
all
the
great
houses
kept
bands
of
armed
retainers
these
retainers
were
given
land
or
pay
or
both
as
well
as
liveries
uniforms
or
badges
bearing
the
family
crest
they
came
to
fight
for
the
cause
of
one
of
the
two
royal
family
lines
competing
for
the
throne
in
the
system
of
livery
and
maintenance
if
the
retainer
was
harassed
by
the
law
or
by
enemies
the
lord
gave
him
protection
maintenance
in
both
wars
the
musket
was
used
as
well
as
the
cannon
were
used
to
besiege
castles
and
destroy
their
walls
so
many
castles
were
allowed
to
deteriorate
the
existence
of
cannon
also
limited
the
usefulness
of
town
walls
for
defense
barons
and
earls
settled
their
disputes
in
the
field
rather
than
in
the
royal
courts
and
men
relied
increasingly
on
the
protection
of
the
great
men
of
their
neighborhood
and
less
on
the
king
courts
for
the
safety
of
their
lives
and
land
local
men
involved
in
court
functions
usually
owed
allegiance
to
a
lord
which
compromised
the
exercise
of
justice
men
serving
in
an
assize
often
lied
to
please
their
lord
instead
of
telling
the
truth
lords
maintained
supported
or
promoted
litigation
with
money
or
aid
supplied
to
one
party
to
the
detriment
of
justice
it
was
not
unusual
for
lords
to
attend
court
with
a
great
force
of
retainers
behind
them
royal
justices
were
flouted
or
bribed
the
king
writ
was
denied
or
perverted
for
a
lord
could
have
the
king
instruct
his
sheriff
to
impanel
a
jury
which
would
find
in
his
favor
a
statute
against
riots
forcible
entries
and
excepting
the
king
magnates
liveries
of
uniform
food
and
badges
to
their
retainers
except
in
war
outside
the
nation
was
passed
but
was
difficult
to
enforce
because
the
offenders
were
lords
who
dominated
the
parliament
and
the
council
since
the
power
of
the
throne
changed
from
one
faction
to
another
many
bills
of
attainder
caused
lords
to
lose
their
lands
to
the
king
fighting
between
lords
and
gangs
of
ruffians
holding
the
roads
breaking
into
and
seizing
manor
houses
and
openly
committing
murders
continued
the
roads
were
not
safe
people
turned
to
mysticism
to
escape
from
the
everyday
violent
world
they
had
no
religious
enthusiasm
but
believed
in
magic
and
sorcery
with
men
so
often
gone
to
fight
their
wives
managed
the
household
alone
the
typical
wife
had
maidens
of
equal
class
to
whom
she
taught
household
management
spinning
weaving
carding
wool
with
iron
heckling
flax
embroidery
and
making
garments
there
were
for
spinning
wheels
she
taught
the
children
each
day
she
scheduled
the
activities
of
the
household
including
music
conversation
dancing
chess
reading
playing
ball
and
gathering
flowers
she
organized
picnics
rode
horseback
and
went
hunting
hawking
to
get
birds
and
she
was
nurse
to
all
around
her
if
her
husband
died
she
usually
continued
in
this
role
because
most
men
named
their
wives
as
executors
of
their
wills
with
full
power
to
act
as
she
thought
best
for
ladies
jackets
came
to
be
worn
over
long
gowns
with
low
necklines
and
flowing
sleeves
under
which
was
worn
a
girdle
all
her

was
confined
by
a
hair

headdresses
were
very
elaborate
and
heavy
trailing
streamers
of
linen
some
were
in
the
shape
of
hearts
butterflies
crescents
double
horns
or
long
cones
men
also
were
wearing
hats
rather
than
hoods
they
wore
huge
hats
of
velvet
fur
or
leather
their
hair
was
cut
into
a
shape
on
their
heads
and
later
was
they
wore
doublets
with
thick
padding
over
the
shoulders
or
short
tunics
over
the
trucks
of
their
bodies
and
tightened
at
the
waist
to
emphasize
the
shoulders
their
collars
were
high
their
sleeves
were
long
concoctions
of
velvet
damask
and
satin
sometimes
worn
wrapped
around
their
arms
in
layers
their
legs
were
covered
with
hose
often
in
different
colors
shoes
were
pointed
with
upward
pikes
at
the
toes
at
another
time
shoes
were
broad
with
blunt
toes
both
men
and
women
wore
much
jewelry
and
ornamentation
cooking
and
the
serving
of
meals
was
also
elaborate
there
were
many
courses
of
a
variety
of
meats
fish
stews
and
soups
with
a
variety
of
spices
the
standard
number
of
meals
was
three
breakfast
dinner
and
supper

diet
of
an
ordinary
family
such
as
that
of
a
small
shopholder
or
yeoman
farmer

a
variety
of
fish
both
fresh
and
salted
venison
nuts
peas
oatmeal
honey
grapes
apples
pears
and
fresh
vegetables
cattle
and
sheep
were
driven
from
wales
to
english
markets
this
droving
lasted
for
five
centuries
many
types
of
people
besides
the
nobility
and
knights
now
had
property
and
thus
were
considered
gentry
female
lines
of
the
nobility
merchants
and
their
sons
lawyers
auditors
squires
and
the
burgess
grew
rich
as
the
knight
dropped
lower
the
great
merchants
lived
in
mansions
which
could
occupy
whole
blocks
typically
there
would
be
an
great
hall
with
adjoining
kitchen
pantry
and
buttery
on
one
end
and
a
great
parlor
to
receive
guests
bedrooms
wardrobes
rooms
and
a
chapel
on
the
other
end
or
on
a
second
floor
the
beds
were
surrounded
by
heavy
draperies
to
keep
out
cold
drafts
master
and
servants
ceased
to
eat
together
in
the
same
hall
in
towns
these
mansions
were
entered
through
a
gate
through
a
row
of
shops
on
the
street
a
lesser
dwelling
would
have
these
rooms
on
three
floors
over
a
shop
on
the
first
floor
an
average
londoner
would
have
a
shop
a
storeroom
a
hall
a
kitchen
and
a
buttery
on
the
first
floor
and
three
bedrooms
on
the
second
floor
artisans
and
shopkeepers
of
more
modest
means
lived
in
rows
of
dwellings
each
with
a
shop
and
small
storage
room
on
the
first
floor
and
a
combination
on
the
second
floor
the
humblest
residents
crowded
their
shop
and
family
into
one
by
foot
room
for
rent
of
a
few
shillings
a
year
all
except
the
last
would
also
have
a
small
garden
the
best
gardens
had
a
fruit
tree
herbs
flowers
a
well
and
a
privy
there
were
common
and
public
privies
for
those
without
their
own
kitchen
slops
and
casual
refuse
continued
to
be
thrown
into
the
street
floors
of
stone
or
planks
were
strewn
with
rushes
there
was
some
tile
flooring
most
dwellings
had
glass
windows
candles
were
used
for
lighting
at
night
torches
and
lanterns
were

perhaps
one

had
a

peasants
still
lived
in
wood
straw
and
mud
huts
with
earth
floors
and
a
smoky
hearth
in
the
center
or
a
kitchen
area
under
the
eaves
of
the
hut
in
bricks
began
to
be
manufactured
in
the
nation
and
so
there
was
more
use
of
bricks
in
buildings
chimneys
were
introduced
into
manor
houses
where
stone
had
been
too
expensive
this
was
necessary
if
a
second
floor
was
added
so
the
smoke
would
not
damage
the
floor
above
it
and
would
eventually
go
out
of
the
house
nobles
and
their
retinue
moved
from
manor
to
manor
as
they
had
for
centuries
to
keep
watch
upon
their
lands
and
to
consume
the
produce
thereof
it
was
easier
to
bring
the
household
to
the
estate
than
to
transport
the
yield
of
the
estate
to
the
household
also
at
regular
intervals

to
be
removed
from
the

wood
on
a
linen
cloth
covering
the
table
hands
were
washed
before
and
after
the
meal

washed
their
faces
every
morning
after
getting
up
teeth
were
cleaned
with
powders
fragrant
leaves
were
chewed
for
bad
breath
garlic
was
used
for
indigestion
and
other
ailments
feet
were
rubbed
with
salt
and
vinegar
to
remove

included
not
slumping

sticking
one

reserved
for
the
nobility
rather
than
just
the
king
as
many
lords
became
less
wealthy
because
of
the
cost
of
war
some
peasants
villein
and
free
became
prosperous
especially
those
who
also
worked
at
a
craft
butchers
bakers
smiths
shoemakers
tailors
carpenters
and
clothworkers
an
agricultural
slump
caused
poorer
soils
to
fall
back
into
waste
the
better
soils
were
leased
by
peasants
who
with
their
families
were
in
a
better
position
to
farm
it
than
a
great
lord
who
found
it
hard
to
hire
laborers
at
a
reasonable
cost
further
peasants
sheep
hens
pigs
ducks
goats
cattle
bees
and
crop
made
them
almost
in
foodstuffs
they
lived
in
a
huddle
of
cottages
pastured
their
animals
on
common
land
and
used
common
meadows
for
they
subsisted
mainly
on
boiled
bacon
an
occasional
chicken
worts
and
beans
grown
in
the
cottage
garden
and
cereals
they
wore
fine
wool
cloth
in
all
their
apparel
brimless
hats
were
replacing
hoods
they
had
an
abundance
of
bed
coverings
in
their
houses
and
they
had
more
free
time
village
entertainment
included
traveling
jesters
acrobats
musicians
and
baiter
playing
games
and
gambling
were
popular
pastimes
most
villeins
were
now
being
called
customary
tenants
or
of
land
because
they
held
their
acres
by
a
copy
of
the
of
the
manor
which
listed
the
number
of
teams
the
fines
the
reliefs
and
the
services
due
to
the
lord
for
each
landholder
the
chancery
court
interpreted
many
of
these
documents
to
include
rights
of
inheritance
the
common
law
courts
followed
the
lead
of
the
chancery
and
held
that
copyhold
land
could
be
inherited
as
was
land
at
common
law
evictions
by
lords
decreased
the
difference
between
villein
and
free
man
lessened
but
landlords
usually
still
had
profits
of
villein
bondage
such
as
heriot
merchet
and
chevage
a
class
of
laborers
was
arising
who
depended
entirely
on
the
wages
of
industry
for
their
subsistence
the
cloth
workers
in
rural
areas
were
isolated
and
weak
and
often
at
the
mercy
of
for
employment
and
the
amount
of
their
wages
rural
laborers
went
to
towns
to
seek
employment
in
the
new
industries
they
would
work
at
first
for
any
rate
this
deepened
the
cleavage
of
the
classes
in
the
towns
the
townspeople
did
not
take
part
in
the
fighting
of
the
war
of
the
roses
many
boroughs
sought
and
obtained
formal
incorporation
with
perpetual
existence
the
right
to
sue
and
be
sued
in
their
own
name
often
a
borough
would
have
its
own
resident
justice
of
the
peace
each
incorporation
involved
a
review
by
a
justice
of
the
peace
to
make
sure
the
charter
of
incorporation
rule
did
conflict
with
the
law
of
the
nation
henry
iv
granted
the
first
charter
of
incorporation
a
borough
typically
had
a
mayor
accompanied
by
his
personal
and
bearing
the
borough
regalia
bailiffs
a
sheriff
and
chamberlains
or
a
steward
for
financial
assistance
at
many
boroughs
aldermen
assisted
by
their
constables
kept
the
peace
in
their
separate
wards
there
might
be
coroners
a
recorder
and
a
town
clerk
with
a
host
of
lesser
officials
including
beadles
aletasters
sealers
searchers
inspectors
weighers
and
keepers
of
the
market
ferrymen
and
porters
and
criers
paviors
maintained
the
roads
scavengers
and
other
street
cleaners
gatekeepers
and
watchmen
of
several
ranks
and
kinds
a
wealthy
borough
would
have
a
chaplain
and
two
or
three
minstrels
in
all
towns
the
wealthiest
and
most
influential
guilds
were
the
merchant
traders
of
mercers
drapers
grocers
and
goldsmiths
from
their
ranks
came
most
of
the
mayors
next
came
the
shopholders
of
skinners
tailors
ironmongers
and
corvisors
shoemakers
thirdly
came
the
humbler
artisans
the
sellers
of
victuals
small
shopkeepers
apprentices
and
journeymen
on
the
rise
lastly
came
unskilled
laborers
who
lived
in
crowded
tenements
and
hired
themselves
out
the
first
three
groups
were
the
free
men
who
voted
paid
the
scot
and
lot
and
belonged
to
guilds
in
the
towns
many
married
women
had
independent
businesses
and
wives
also
played
an
active
part
in
the
businesses
of
their
husbands
wives
of
london
merchants
embroidered
sewed
jewelry
onto
clothes
and
made
silk
garments
widows
often
continued
in
their
husband
businesses
such
as
managing
a
large
trade
tailoring
brewing
and
metal
shop
socially
lower
women
often
ran
their
own
breweries
bakeries
and
taverns
it
was
possible
for
wives
to
be
free
burgesses
in
their
own
right
in
some
towns
some
ladies
were
patrons
of
writers
some
women
were
active
in
prison
reform
in
matters
of
reviews
to
insure
that
no
man
was
in
jail
without
due
cause
overcharges
for
bed
and
board
brutality
and
regulation
of
prisoners
being
placed
in
irons
many
men
and
women
left
money
in
their
wills
for
food
and
clothing
for
prisoners
there
was
much
overlapping
in
the
two
forms
of
association
the
craft
guild
and
the
religious
fraternity
paved
roads
in
towns
were
usually
gravel
and
sometimes
cobble
they
were
frequently
muddy
because
of
rain
and
spillage
of
water
being
carried
wheels
and
overloaded
carts
made
them
very
uneven
london
was
the
first
town
with
paviors
they
repaired
and
cleaned
the
streets
were
usually
just
filled
up
with
wood
chips
and
compacted
with
hand
rams
they
were
organized
as
a
city
company
in
about
towns
besides
london
began
appointing
salaried
road
paviors
to
repair
roads
and
collect
their
expenses
from
the
householders
because
the
policy
of
placing
the
burden
on
individual
householders
work
well
london
streets
were
lighted
at
night
by
public
lanterns
under
the
direction
of
the
mayor
there
were
composed
of
a
circular
cistern
with
a
pump
and
six
feet
of
inflexible
hose
on
wheels
pulled
by
two
men
on
one
end
and
pushed
by
two
men
on
the
other
end
the
king
granted
london
all
common
soils
improvements
wastes
streets
and
ways
in
london
and
in
the
adjacent
waters
of
the
thames
river
and
all
the
profits
and
rents
to
be
derived
therefrom
later
the
king
granted
london
the
liberty
to
purchase
lands
and
tenements
worth
up
to
yearly
each
ward
nominated
two
men
for
alderman
the
final
choice
being
made
by
the
mayor
and
the
other
aldermen
there
were
many
craft
guilds
in
fact
every
trade
of
twenty
men
had
its
own
guild
the
guild
secured
good
work
for
its
members
and
the
members
maintained
the
reputation
of
the
work
standards
of
the
guild
bad
work
was
punished
and
night
work
prohibited
as
leading
to
bad
work
the
guild
exercised
moral
control
over
its
members
and
provided
sickness
and
death
benefits
for
them
apprentices
were
taken
in
to
assure
an
adequate
supply
of
competent
workers
for
the
future
when
these
apprentices
had
enough
training
they
were
made
journeymen
with
a
higher
rate
of
pay
journeymen
traveled
to
see
the
work
of
their
craft
in
other
towns
those
journeymen
rising
to
master
had
the
highest
pay
rate
but
the
guilds
were
being
replaced
by
associations
for
the
investment
of
capital
in
associations
journeymen
were
losing
their
chance
of
rising
to
be
a
master
competition
among
associations
was
starting
to
supplant
custom
as
the
mainspring
of
trade
the
merchant
adventurers
was
chartered
in
a
share
in
the
ownership
of
one
of
their
vessels
was
a
common
form
of
investment
by
prosperous
merchants
by
they
were
dealing
in
linen
cloths
buckrams
a
stiffened
coarse
cloth
fustians
coarse

the
other
satins
jewels
fine
woolen
and
linen
wares
threads
drugs
wood
oil
wine
salt
copper
and
iron
they
began
to
replace
trade
by
alien
traders
the
history
of
the
merchant
adventurers
was
associated
with
the
growth
of
the
mercantile
system
for
more
than
years
it
eventually
replaced
the
staples
system
in
london
shopkeepers
appealed
to
to
buy
their
goods
sometimes
even
seizing
people
by
the
sleeve
the
drapers
had
several
roomy
shops
containing
shelves
piled
with
cloths
of
all
colors
and
grades
tapestries
pillows
and
and
dorsers
to
soften

the
grocers
did
some
usually
at
interest
the
guilds
did
not
restrict
themselves
to
dealing
in
the
goods
for
which
they
had
a
right
of
inspection
and
so
many
dealt
in
wine
that
it
was
a
medium
of
exchange
there
was
no
sharp
distinction
between
retail
and
wholesale
trading
grocers
sold
herbs
for
medicinal
as
well
as
eating

the
large

of
london
trade
promoted
the
specialization
of
the
manufacturer
versus
the

versus
the

merchants
had
enough
wealth
to
make

to
the

some
london
merchants
were
knighted
by
the

many
bought

turned
themselves
into
gentry
in

there
was
a
renaissance
of
learning
from

written
in

and
rebirth
of
the

the
number

tended
to
send
their
sons
to
private
boarding
schools
instead
of

them
tutored
at

the

parents
still

with
the

wore
their

coat

and
became
their
squires
as
part
of
their
knightly
education
at
the
universities
the
bachelor
degree
came
into

to
denote
a
preliminary
stage
in
the
course
of
becoming
a
master
the
book
sir
gawain
and
the

was
written
about
an
incident
in

arthur
and
queen
guenevere
in
which
a
green
knight
challenges
arthur
knights
to
live
up
to
their
reputation
for
valor
and
awesome
deeds
the
knight
gawain
answers
the
challenge
but
is
shown
that
he
could
be
false
and
cowardly
when
death
seemed
to
be
imminent
thereafter
he
wears
a
green
girdle
around
his

was
engendering
more

monks

resigned

now
the

too
lost
much
of

got
used
to
life
with
many
servants
such
as
cooks
butlers

barbers
laundresses
tailors
carpenters
and
farm
hands
the
austerity
of
their

had
vanished
the

was
no

followed
by

and
the

was
abandoned
into

people
relied
on
saint
days
as

points
in

year
because
they
did
not
know
dates
of
the
year
but
townspeople
knew
the
hour
and
minute
of
each
day
because
mechanical
clocks
were
in
all
towns
and
in
the

of
the
this
increased
the
sense
of
punctuality
and
higher
standards
of

important
news
was
announced
and
spread
by

provided
one
of
the
best
sources
of

they
maintained
an
informal

of
speedy

and
accurate

so
affected
their

a

service
was
established
by

yeoman
could
order

from
the

communicate
readily
with

in

and
receive
news
of
the

frequently
trade
with
london
was
so
great
and
the
common
carrier
so
efficient
in
transporting
goods
that
the
medieval
fair
began
to
decline
first
the
grocers
and
then
the
mercers
refused
to
allow
their

the

the
increase
in

made
piracy
even

profitable
and
frequent
until

began

the
commons
gained
much
power
in
parliament
under
henry
iv
because
he
needed
so
much
taxes
that
the
commons
had
a
hold
over
him
also
as
a
usurper
king
he
did
not
carry
the
natural
authority
of
a

the
lords
who
helped
his
usurpation
felt
they
should
share
the
natural
power
of
the
kingship
also
the
commons
gained
power
compared
to
the
nobility
because
many
nobles
had
died
in

shakespeare

the

now
has
a

the

established
an
exclusive
right
to
originate
all

grants
to
the
king
in
the
commons
announced
its
money
grant
only
on
the
last
day
of
the
parliamentary
session
after
the
answers
to
its

had
been
declared
it
tied
its

by

rather
than
just

to
be

to
audit
the

account
to
ensure
past

lost

the

the
consent
of
the

to

were
forbidden
to

joint

for

by
force
of
which
feoffment
or
lease
they
are
seised
such
are
and
it
is
to
be
understood
that
the
nature
of
is
that
he
that
surviveth
shall
have
solely
the
entire
tenancy
according
to
such
estate
as
he
hath
tenants

are
they
that
have

in

for

of

the
which
have
such
lands
and
tenements
by
several
title
and
not
by
joint
title
and
neither
of
them
knoweth
thereof
his
severalty
but
they
ought
by
the
law
to
occupy
such
lands
or
tenements
in
common
pro
indiviso
to
take
the
profits
in

as
if
a
man
enfeoff
two
in
fee
and
the
one
of
them
alien
that
which
to
him
belongeth
to
another
in

now
the
other
and
the
alienee
are
tenants

judicial
procedure
people
took
grievances
outside
the
confines
of
the
rigid
common
law
to
the
chancellor
who
could
give
equitable
remedies
under
authority
of
a
statute
of
described
in
chapter
the
chancery
heard
many
cases
of
breach
of
faith
in
the
use
a
form
of
trust
in
which
three
parties
were
involved
the
holder
of
land
feofees
to
whom
the
holder
had
made
it
over
by
conveyance
or
bargain
and
sale
and
the
beneficiary
or
receiver
of
the
profits
of
the
land
who
was
often
the
holder
his
children
relatives
friends
an
institution
or
a
corporation
this
system
of
using
land
had
been
created
by
the
friars
to
get
around
the
prohibition
against
holding
property
lords
and
gentry
quickly
adopted
it
the
advantages
of
the
use
were
that
there
was
no
legal
restriction
to
will
away
the
beneficial
interest
of
the
use
although
the
land
itself
could
not
be
conveyed
by
will
it
was
hard
for
the
king
to
collect
feudal
incidents
because
the
feoffees
were
often
unknown
the
original
holder
was
protected
from
forfeiture
of
his
land
in
case
of
conviction
of
treason
if
the
crown
went
to
someone
he
had
not
supported
chancery
gave
a
remedy
for
dishonest
or
defaulting
feofees
chancery
also
provided
the
equitable
relief
of
specific
performance
in
disputes
over
agreements
for
instance
conveyance
of
certain
land
whereas
the
common
law
courts
awarded
only
monetary
damages
by
the
writ
of
covenant
chancery
ordered
accounts
to
be
made
in
matters
of
foreign
trade
because
the
common
law
courts
were
limited
to
accounts
pursuant
to
transactions
made
within
the
nation
it
also
involved
itself
in
the
administration
of
assets
and
accounting
of
partners
to
each
other
the
chancellor
took
jurisdiction
of
cases
of
debt
detinue
and
account
which
had
been
decided
in
other
courts
with
oathhelping
by
the
defendant
he
did
not
trust
the
reliance
on
friends
of
the
defendant
swearing
that
his
statement
made
in
his
defense
was
true
an
important
evidentiary
difference
between
procedures
of
the
chancery
and
the
common
law
courts
was
that
the
chancellor
could
orally
question
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
under
oath
he
also
could
order
persons
to
appear
at
his
court
by
subpoena
under
pain
of
punishment
such
as
a
heavy
fine
whereas
the
characteristic
award
of
the
common
law
courts
was
seisin
of
land
or
monetary
damages
chancery
often
enjoined
certain
action
because
malicious
suits
were
a
problem
the
chancery
identified
such
suits
and
issued
injunctions
against
taking
them
to
any
court
the
chancery
was
given
jurisdiction
by
statute
over
men
of
great
power
taking
by
force
women
who
had
lands
and
tenements
or
goods
and
not
setting
them
free
unless
they
bound
themselves
to
pay
great
sums
to
the
offenders
or
to
marry
them
a
statute
also
gave
chancery
jurisdiction
over
servants
taking
their
goods
at
his
death
justices

at

henry
vii
restored
order
to
the

he
was
readily
accepted
as
king
because
he
was
descended
from
both
royal
lines
who
were
fighting
each
other
and
married
a
woman
who
also
was
in
the
royal
bloodline
henry
was
intelligent
and
sensitive
he
weighed
alternatives
and
possible
consequences
before
taking
action
he
was
convinced
by
reason
on
what
plans
to
make
his
primary
strategy
was
enacting
and
enforcing
statutes
to
shore
up
the
undermined
legal
system
which
includes
the
establishment
of
a
new
court
the
court
of
the
star
chamber
to
obtain
punishment
of
persons
whom
juries
were
afraid
to
convict

the
star
chamber
was
the
room
in
which
the
king
council
had
met
since
the
in
his
reign
of
years
henry
applied
himself
diligently
to
the
details
of
the
work
of
government
to
make
it
work
well
he
strengthened
the
monarchy
shored
up
the
legal
system
to
work
again
and
provided
a
peace
in
the

in
which
can
later
flourish
a

justices

the
agricultural
work
of
the
nation
had

affected
henry
made
policy
with
the
advice
of
his
council
and
implemented
it
by
causing
parliament
to
enact
it
into
legislation
he
dominated
parliament
by
having
selected
most
of
its
members
many
of
his
council
were
sons
of
burgesses
and
had
been
trained
in
universities
he
chose
competent
and
especially
trusted
men
for
his
officers
and
commanders
of
castles
and
garrison
the
fact
that
only
the
king
had
artillery
deterred
barons
from
revolting
also
the
baronial
forces
were
depleted
due
to
war
if
henry
thought
a
magnate
was
exercising
his
territorial
power
to
the
king
detriment
he
confronted
him
with
an
army
and
forced
him
to
bind
his
whole
family
in
recognizances
for
large
sums
of
money
to
ensure
future
good
conduct
since
the
king
had
the
authority
to
interpret
these
pledges
they
were
a
formidable
check
on
any
activity
which
could
be
considered
to
be
disloyal
the
earl
of
kent
whose
debts
put
him
entirely
at
the
mercy
was
bound
to
be
seen
daily
once
in
the
day
within
the
king
house
henry
also
required
recognizances
from
men
of
all
classes
including
clergy
captains
of
royal
castles
and
receivers
of
land
the
higher
nobility
now
consisted
of
about
twenty
families
the
heavy
fines
by
the
star
court
put
an
end
to
conspiracies

champerty
an
agreement
with
a
litigant
to
pay

of

for
a
share
in
the
damages
awarded
livery
and
maintenance
the
ties
between
the
nobility
and
the
justices
of
the
peace
had
encouraged
corruption
of
justice
so
henry
appointed
many
of
the
lesser
gentry
and
attorneys
as
justices
of
the
peace
also
he
appointed
a
few
of
his
councilors
as
justices
of
the
peace
there
were
a
total
of
about
thirty
justices
of
the
peace
per
county
their
appointments
were
indefinite
and
most
remained
until
retirement
or
death
henry
had
yeomen
serve
as
personal
bodyguards
night
and
day
many
bills
of
attainder
caused
lords
to
lose
their
land
to
the
king
most
of
these
lords
had
been
chronic
disturbers
of
the
peace
henry
was
also
known
to
exhaust
the
resources
of
barons
he
suspected
of
disloyalty
by
accepting
their
hospitality
for
himself
and
his
household
for
an
extended
period
of
time
henry
built
up
royal
funds
by
using
every
available
procedure
of
government
to
get
money
by
maximizing
income
from
royal
estates
by
transferring
authority
over
them
from
the
exchequer
to
knowledgeable
receivers
and
from
forfeitures
of
land
and
property
due
to
attaints
of
treason
he
also
personally
reviewed
all
accounts
and
initialed
every
page
making
sure
that
all
payments
were
made
he
made
a
regular
practice
of
ordering
all
men
with
lands
with
pounds
per
year
to
receive
knighthoods
or
pay
a
high
fee
as
a
result
the
crown
became
rich
and
therefore
powerful
queen
elizabeth
was
a
good
influence
on
henry
character
her
active
beneficence
was
a
counteracting
influence
to
his
avaricious
predisposition
when
henry
and
his
queen
traveled
through
the
nation
they
often
stopped
to
talk
to
the
common
people
they
sometimes
gave
away
money
such
as
to
a
man
who
had
lost
his
hand
henry
paid
for
an
intelligent
boy
he
met
to
go
to
school
henry
had
the
first
paper
mill
erected
in
the
nation
he
fostered
the
reading
of
books
and
the
study
of
roman
law
the
classics
and
the
bible
he
had
his
own
library
and
gave
books
to
other
libraries
the
age
of
entry
to
university
was
between
and
it
took
four
years
study
of
grammar
logic
and
rhetoric
to
achieve
the
bachelor
of
arts
degree
and
another
five
before
a
master
could
begin
a

study
of
the
civil

learning
oxford

and
the

in

the
inns

attracted
the

and

pursuing
practical
and
social
accomplishments

of
the
inns
survive
from
this
time
in
the
legalistic
climate
of
these
times
attorneys
were
prosperous
the
enclosure
of
land
by
hedges
for
sheep
farming
continued
especially
by
rich
merchants
who
bought
country
land
for
this
purpose
often
this
was
land
under
the
plough
the
tenants
at
will
were
thrown
off
it
immediately
that
land
held
by
copyholders
of
land
who
had
only
a
life
estate
was
withheld
from
their
sons
only
freeholders
and
copyholders
with
the
custom
of
the
manor
in
their
favor
were
secure
against
eviction
the
real
line
of
distinction
between
rural
people
was
one
of
material
means
instead
of
legal
status
free
or
unfree
on
one
extreme
was
the
yeoman
farmer
farming
his
own
land
on
the
other
extreme
was
the
agricultural
laborer
working
for
wages
other
land
put
to
use
for
sheep
breeding
was
waste
land
there
were
three
sheep
to
every

the
nearby
woodlands
no
longer
had
wolves
or
lynx
who
could
kill
the
sheep
bears
and

are
also
gone
there
were
still

wild
boar
wildcats
and
wild
cattle
in
vast
forests
for
the
lords
to
hunt
wood
was
used
for
houses
arms
carts
bridges
and
ships
the
villages
were
still
isolated
from
each
other
so
that
a
visitor
from
miles
away
was
treated
as
warily
as
a
foreigner
most
people
lived
and
died
where
they
had
been

the

london
had
a

was
increasing
but
did
not
reach
the
level
of
the
period
just
before
the
black
death
in
most
large
towns
there
were
groups
of
tailors
and
hatmakers
glovers
and
other
leatherworkers
some
towns
had
a
specialization
due
to
their
proximity
to
the
sources
of
raw
materials
such
as
nails
cutlery
and
effigies
and
altars
despite
the
spread
of
wool
manufacturing
to
the
countryside
there
was
a
marked
increase
of
industry
and
prosperity
in
the
towns
the
principal
streets
of
the
larger

were
paved
with
gravel
gild

became
important

architecturally
london
had
some

city
politics
mercers
grocers

fishmongers
haberdashers
ironmongers
vintners
goldsmiths
skinners
salters
company
of
merchant
tailors
and
the
clothworkers
composed
from
leading
fullers
and
shearmen
the
leading
men
of
these
guilds
were
generally
aldermen
and
the
guilds
acted
like
municipal
committees
of
trade
and
manufactures
then
they
acted
like
a
state
department
for
the
superintendence
of
the
trade
and
manufactures
of
london
they
were
called
livery
companies
and
categorized
their
memberships
in
three
grades
mere
membership
livery
membership
and
placement
on
the
governing
body
livery
membership
was
distinguished
by
having
the
clothing
of
the
brotherhood
and
were
usually
those
who
bought
membership
and
paid
higher
fees
because
they
were
richer
most
of
these
companies
had
almshouses
attached
to
their
halls
for
the
impoverished
disabled
and
elderly
members
and
their
widows
and
children
for
instance
many
members
of
the
goldsmiths
had
been
blinded
by
the
fire
and
smoke
of
quick
silver
and
some
members
had
been
rendered
crazed
and
infirm
by
working
in
that
trade
the
pensions
of
the
liverymen
were
larger
than
those
of
mere
members
and
they
generally
had
a
right
to
a
place
at
those
banquets
which
are
chartered
franchises
and
they
are
invited
by
the
governing
body
as
a
matter
of
favor
to
other
entertainments
the
freedom
and
rights
of
citizenship
of
the
city
could
only
be
obtained
through
membership
in
a
livery
company
a
lesser
guild
the
leathersellers
absorbed
the
glovers
pursers
and
pouchmakers
these
craftsmen
then
became
wage
earners
of
the
leathersellers
but
others
of
these
craftsmen
remained
independent
before
the
whittawyers
who
treated
horse
deer
and
sheep
hides
with
alum
and
oil
had
become
for
the
skinners
there
are
wards
of
london
as
of
this
is
the
number
for
the
next
four
centuries
each
has
an
alderman
a
clerk
and
a
constable
though
there
was
much
agreement
on
the
faults
of
the
church
and
the
need
to
reform
it
there
were
many
disagreements
on
what
philosophy
of
life
should
take
the
place
of
church
teachings
the
humanist
thomas
more
was
a
university
trained
intellectual
his
book
utopia
idealized
an
imaginary
society
of
pagans
living
according
to
the
principles
of
natural
virtue
in
it
everything
is
owned
in
common
and
there
is
no
need
for
money
there
is
agreement
that
there
is
a
god
who
created
the
world
and
all
good
things
and
who
guides
men
but
otherwise
people
choose
their
religious
beliefs
and
their
priests
from
this
perspective
the
practices
of
current
christians
scholastic
theologicians
priests
and
monks
superstition
and
ritual
look
absurd
he
encouraged
a
religious
revival
aristotle
position
that
virtuous
men
would
rule
best
is
successfully
debated
against
plato
position
that
intellectuals
and
philosophers
would
be
the
ideal
rulers
more
plead
for
proportion
between
punishment
and
crime
he
urged
that
theft
no
longer
be
punished
by
death
because
this
only
encouraged
the
thief
to
murder
his
victim
to
eliminate
evidence
of
the
theft
he
opined
that
the
purpose
of
punishment
was
to
reform
offenders
he
advocated
justice
for
the
poor
to
the
standard
of
justice
received
by
the
rich
erasmus
a
former
monk
visited
the
nation
for
a
couple
of
years
and
argued
that
reason
should
prevail
over
religious
belief
he
wrote
the
book
in
praise
of
folly
which
noted
man
elaborate
pains
in
misdirected
efforts
to
gain
the
wrong
thing
for
instance
it
questioned
what
man
would
stick
his
head
into
the
halter
of
marriage
if
he
first
weighed
the
inconveniences
of
that
life
or
what
woman
would
ever
embrace
her
husband
if
she
foresaw
or
considered
the
dangers
of
childbirth
and
the
drudgery
of
motherhood
childhood
and
senility
are
the
most
pleasant
stages
of
life
because
ignorance
is
bliss
old
age
forgetfulness
washes
away
the
cares
of
the
mind
a
foolish
and
doting
old
man
is
freed
from
the
miseries
that
torment
the
wise
and
has
the
chief
joy
of
life
garrulousness
the
seekers
of
wisdom
are
the
farthest
from
happiness
they
forget
the
human
station
to
which
they
were
born
and
use
their
arts
as
engines
with
which
to
attack
nature
the
least
unhappy
are
those
who
approximate
the
naiveness
of
the
beasts
and
who
never
attempt
what
is
beyond
men
as
an
example
is
anyone
happier
than
a
moron
or
fool
their
cheerful
confusion
of
the
mind
frees
the
spirit
from
care
and
gives
it
delights
fools
are
free
from
the
fear
of
death
and
from
the
pangs
of
conscience
they
are
not
filled
with
vain
worries
and
hopes
they
are
not
troubled
by
the
thousand
cares
to
which
this
life
is
subject
they
experience
no
shame
fear
ambition
envy
or
love
in
a
world
where
man
are
mostly
at
odds
all
agree
in
their
attitude
towards
these
innocents
they
are
sought
after
and
sheltered
everyone
permits
them
to
do
and
say
what
they
wish
with
impunity
however
the
usual
opinion
is
that
nothing
is
more
lamentable
than
madness
the
christian
religion
has
some
kinship
with
folly
while
it
has
none
at
all
with
wisdom
for
proof
of
this
notice
that
children
old
people
women
and
fools
take
more
delight
than
anyone
else
in
holy
and
religious
things
led
no
doubt
solely
by
instinct
next
notice
that
the
founders
of
religion
have
prized
simplicity
and
have
been
the
bitterest
foes
of
learning
finally
no
people
act
more
foolishly
than
those
who
have
been
truly
possessed
with
christian
piety
they
give
away
whatever
is
theirs
they
overlook
injuries
allow
themselves
to
be
cheated
make
no
distinction
between
friends
and
enemies
shun
pleasure
and
feast
on
hunger
vigils
tears
labors
and
scorn
they
disdain
life
and
utterly
prefer
death
in
short
they
have
become
altogether
indifferent
to
ordinary
interests
as
if
their
souls
lived
elsewhere
and
not
in
their
bodies
what
is
this
if
not
to
be
mad
the
life
of
christians
is
run
over
with
nonsense
they
make
elaborate
funeral
arrangements
with
candles
mourners
singers
and
pallbearers
they
must
think
that
their
sight
will
be
returned
to
them
after
they
are
dead
or
that
their
corpses
will
fall
ashamed
at
not
being
buried
grandly
christian
theologians
in
order
to
prove
a
point
will
pluck
out
four
or
five
words
from
different
places
even
falsifying
the
sense
of
them
if
necessary
and
disregard
the
fact
that
the
context
is
irrelevant
or
even
contradicts
the
point
they
do
this
with
such
brazen
skill
that
our
lawyers
are
often
jealous
of
them
lawyer
christopher
german
wrote
the
legal
treatise
doctor
and
student
in
which
he
deems
the
law
of
natural
reason
to
be
supreme
and
eternal
the
law
of
god
and
the
law
of
man
as
enunciated
by
the
church
and
royalty
merely
supplement
the
law
of
natural
reason
and
may
change
from
time
to
time
examples
of
the
law
of
reason
are
it
is
good
to
be
loved
evil
is
to
be
avoided
do
onto
others
as
you
would
have
them
do
unto
you
do
nothing
against
the
truth
live
peacefully
with
others
justice
is
to
be
done
to
every
man
no
one
is
to
wrong
another
a
trespasser
should
be
punished
from
these
is
deduced
that
a
man
should
love
his
benefactor
it
is
lawful
to
put
away
force
with
force
it
is
lawful
for
every
man
to
defend
himself
and
his
goods
against
an
unlawful
power
like
his
father
henry
viii
dominated
parliament
he
used
this
power
to
reform
the
church
of
england
in
the
the
protestant
reformation
cause
had
become
identified
with
his
efforts
to
have
his
marriage
of
eighteen
years
to
the
virtuous
catherine
annulled
so
he
could
marry
a
much
younger
woman
anne
his
purported
reason
was
to
have
a
son
the
end
of
his
six
successive
wives
was
divorced
beheaded
died
divorced
beheaded
survived
henry
viii
was
egotistical
arrogant
and
this
nature
allowed
him
to
declare
himself
the
head
of
the
church
of
england
instead
of
the
pope
henry
used
and
then
discarded
officers
of
state
by
executing
them
for
supposed
treason
one
such
was
thomas
wolsey
the
son
of
a
town
butcher
was
another
supporter
of
classical
learning
he
rose
through
the
church
the
gateway
to
advancement
in
a
diversity
of
occupations
of
clergy
such
as
secretary
librarian
teacher
lawyer
doctor
author
civil
servant
diplomat
and
statesman
he
was
a
court
priest
when
he
aligned
himself
with
henry
both
of
whom
wanted
power
and
glory
and
dressed
extravagantly
but
he
was
brilliant
and
more
of
a
strategist
than
henry
wolsey
was
a
reformer
by
name
and
started
a
purge
of
criminals
vagrants
and
prostitutes
within
london
bringing
many
before
the
council
but
most
of
his
reforming
plans
were
not
brought
to
fruition
but
ended
after
his
campaign
resulted
in
more
power
for
himself
wolsey
rose
to
be
chancellor
to
the
king
and
archbishop
of
york
as
the
representative
of
the
pope
for
england
he
exercised
almost
full
papal
authority
there
but
he
controlled
the
church
in
england
in
the
king
interest
he
was
second
only
to
the
king
he
also
came
to
control
the
many
courts
wolsey
centralized
the
church
in
england
and
dissolved
the
smaller
monasteries
the
proceeds
of
which
he
used
to
build
colleges
at
oxford
and
his
home
town
he
was
an
impartial
and
respected
judge
when
wolsey
was
not
able
to
convince
the
pope
to
give
henry
a
divorce
henry
dismissed
him
and
took
his
property
shortly
after
which
wolsey
died
the
king
replaced
wolsey
as
chancellor
with
thomas
more
after
whom
he
made
thomas
cromwell
chancellor
cromwell
was
the
son
of
a
clothworker
and
a
taught
lawyer
arbitrator
merchant
and
accountant
like
wolsey
he
was
a
natural
orator
he
drafted
and
had
passed
legislation
that
created
a
new
church
of
england
he
had
all
men
swear
an
oath
to
the
terms
of
the
succession
act
thomas
more
was
known
for
his
honesty
and
was
a
highly
respected
man
more
did
not
yield
to
henry
bullying
for
support
for
his
statute
declaring
the
succession
to
be
vested
in
the
children
of
his
second
marriage
and
his
statute
declaring
himself
the
supreme
head
of
the
church
of
england
instead
of
the
pope
he
did
not
expressly
deny
the
supremacy
act
so
was
not
guilty
of
treason
under
its
terms
but
silence
did
not
save
him
he
was
attainted
for
treason
on
specious
grounds
and
beheaded
he
conviction
rested
on
the
testimony
of
one
perjured
witness
who
misquoted
more
as
saying
that
parliament
did
not
have
the
power
to
require
assent
to
the
supremacy
act
because
it
was
repugnant
to
the
common
law
of
christendom
through
his
host
of
spies
cromwell
heard
what
men
said
to
their
closest
friends
words
idly
spoken
were
tortured
into
treason
henry
had
many
bills
of
attainder
passed
by
parliament
silence
was
a
person
only
possibility
of
safety
fear
spread
through
the
people
cromwell
developed
a
technique
for
the
management
of
the
house
of
commons
which
lasted
for
generations
he
promulgated
books
in
defense
of
royal
spiritual
authority
which
argued
that
canon
law
was
not
divine
but
merely
human
and
that
clerical
authority
had
no
foundation
in
the
bible
a
reformed
english
bible
was
put
in
all
parish
churches
reformers
were
licensed
to
preach
cromwell
ordered
sermons
to
be
said
which
proclaimed
the
supremacy
of
the
king
he
instituted
registers
to
record
baptisms
marriages
and
burials
in
every
county
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
disputes
over
descent
and
inheritance
he
dissolved
all
the
lesser
monasteries
when
cromwell
procured
a
foreign
wife
for
henry
whom
henry
found
unattractive
he
was
attainted
and
executed
thomas
cranmer

english
common
book
of

with
its

the

by

shared
by

prayers
for

miracles
the
worship
of

and
pilgrimages
to
shrines
such
as
that
of
thomas

were
all
to
be
discontinued
imprisonment
or
exile
rather
than
death
was
made
the
penalty
for
heresy
and
blasphemy
and
also
for
adultery
after
the
king
dissolved
the
greater
monasteries
he
took
and
sold
their
ornaments
silver
plate
and
jewelry
lead
from
roofs
of
their
buildings
and
finally
much
of
the
land
itself
three
monasteries
were
converted
into
the
first
three
treating
hospitals
in
london
one
for
the
diseased
one
for
the
poor
and
one
bethlehem
or
bedlam
for
short
for
the
mentally
henry
used
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
monasteries
for
building
many
new
palaces
and
wood
ships
for
his
navy
in
war
these
navy
ships
had
heavy
guns
which
could
sink
other
ships
in
peace
time
these
ships
were
hired
out
to
traders
large
ships
were
constructed
in
docks
made
partly
by
digging
and
partly
by
building
walls
the
former
land
of
the
monasteries
about
of
the
land
was
sold
and
resold
or
leased
some
went
to
entrepreneurial
cloth
manufacturers
who
converted
the
buildings
for
the
manufacture
of
cloth
they
bought
the
raw
wool
and
hired
craftsmen
for
every
step
of
the
manufacturing
process
to
be
done
in
one
continuous
process
this
was
faster
than
buying
and
selling
the
wool
material
between
craftsmen
who
lived
in
different
areas
also
it
was
more
efficient
because
the
amount
of
raw
wool
bought
could
be
adjusted
to
the
demand
for
cloth
many
landowners
now
could
live
in
towns
exclusively
off
the
rents
of
their
rural
land
rents
were
increased
so
much
that
tenants
could
not
pay
and
were
evicted
they
usually
became
beggars
or
thieves
much
of
their
former
land
was
converted
from
crop
raising
to
pasture
for
large
herds
of
sheep
arable
farming
required
many
workers
whereas
sheep
farming
required
only
one
shepherd
and
herdsman
there
were
exceptional
profits
made
from
the
export
of
wool
cloth
but
much
raw
wool
was
still
exported
it
price
went
up
from
per

in
to
in
villeinage
was
now
virtually
extinct
a
lord
could
usually
claim
a
small
rent
from
the
freeholder
sometimes
a
relief
when
his
land
was
sold
or
passed
at
death
and
occasionally
a
heriot
from
his
heir
there
was
steady
inflation
landlords
made
their
leases
short
term
so
that
they
could
raise
rents
as
prices
rose
at
least
of
the
population
still
lived
in
the
country
rich
traders
built
town
or
country
houses
in
which
the
emphasis
was
on
comfort
and
privacy
there
was
more
furniture
bigger
windows
filled
with
glass
wallpaper
and
formal
gardens
some
floors
were
tiled
instead
of
stone
or
wood
they
were
still
strewn
with
straw
the
owners
ate
in
a
private
dining
room
and
slept
in
their

they
had

on

cloth
bore
the
mark
of
its

colors
cloth
could
be
held
together
with
pins
that
had
a
shank
with
a
hook
by
which
they
were
closed
people
went
to
barbers
to
cut
their

and
to
extract

they
went
to
people

for

of

conditions
such
as

burns
swellings
irritated

they
went
to

who
prescribed

they
bought
drugs
and
medicines
from
apothecaries
and
pharmacists
they
burned
wood
logs
in
the
fireplaces
in
their
houses
so
much
wood
was
used
that
young

were
required
by

to
be
given
enough
lateral
space
to
spread
their

not

the

who
had

and
a

in
the

still
lived
in
the
most
comfort
the
king
house
had
courtyards
gardens
orchards
tennis

lawyers
had

chapter
the
times
queen
elizabeth
i
was
intelligent
educated
and
wise
about
human
nature
when
young
she
was
a
brilliant
student
then
she
studied
much
history
philosophy
and
oratory
she
wrote
in
english
latin
french
and
italian
she
read
greek
including
the
greek
testament
greek
orators
and
greek
dramatists
at
age
seven
when
the
first
professorship
of
greek
was
founded
at
cambridge
university
learning
was
one
of
her
highest
values
throughout
her
life
she
had
good
judgment
in
selecting
her
ministers
and
advisors
for
her
privy
council
like
her
father
and
grandfather
she
dominated
parliament
she
was
so
influenced
by
her
reading
of
cicero
that
she
acquired
his
style
of
writing
her
chief
secretary
william
cecil
was
so
guided
by
cicero
offices
that
he
carried
a
copy
in
his
pocket
cicero
opined
that
government
officials
duty
was
to
make
the
safety
and
interest
of
citizens
its
greatest
aim
and
to
design
all
their
thoughts
and
endeavors
without
ever
considering
personal
advantage
government
was
not
to
serve
the
interest
of
any
one
group
to
the
prejudice
or
neglect
of
the
rest
for
then
discord
and
sedition
would
occur
furthermore
a
governor
should
try
to
become
loved
and
not
feared
because
men
hated
those
whom
they
feared
and
wished
dead
those
whom
they
hated
therefore
obedience
proceeding
from
fear
could
not
last
whereas
that
which
was
the
effect
of
love
would
last
forever
an
oppressor
ruling
by
terror
will
be
resented
by
the
citizens
who
in
secret
will
choose
a
worthier
person
then
liberty
having
been
chained
up
would
be
unleashed
more
fiercely
than
otherwise
to
obtain
the
peoples
love
a
governor
should
be
kind
and
bountiful
to
obtain
the
peoples
trust
a
governor
should
be
just
wise
and
faithful
to
demonstrate
this
a
governor
should
be
eloquent
in
showing
the
people
an
understanding
better
than
theirs
the
wisdom
to
anticipate
events
and
the
ability
to
deal
with
adverse
events
and
this
demonstration
should
be
done
with
modesty
one
can
not
get
the
peoples
trust
by
vain
shows
hypocritical
pretenses
composed
countenances
and
studied
forms
of
words
the
first
goal
of
a
governor
is
to
take
care
that
each
individual
is
secured
in
the
quiet
enjoyment
of
his
own
property
the
second
goal
is
to
impose
taxes
that
are
not
burdensome
the
third
goal
is
to
furnish
the
people
with
necessaries
the
law
should
be
enforced
keeping
in
mind
that
its
fundamental
purpose
is
to
keep
up
agreement
and
union
among
citizens
elizabeth
cared
deeply
for
the
welfare
of
all
citizens
of
whatever
class
she
was
sensitive
to
public
opinion
and
wanted
to
be
loved
by
her
people
which
she
was
she
was
frugal
and
diplomatically
avoided
unnecessary
wars
saying
that
her
purse
was
the
pockets
of
her
people
england
was
a
small
protestant
nation
threatened
by
the
larger
catholic
nations
of
france
and
spain
elizabeth
flirted
with
foreign
princes
to
make
them
waste
their
time
trying
to
get
england
by
marrying
her
instead
of
by
war
her
promotion
of
commercial
speculations
diffused
a
vast
increase
of
wealth
among
her
people
her
good
spirits
and
gayness
created
a
happy
mood
in
the
nation
she
loved
dancing
and
madrigal
music
was
popular
the
elizabethan
era
was
one
of
general
prosperity
elizabeth
came
to
dress
elaborately
and
fancifully
her
dresses
were
fitted
at
the
waist
with
a
long
and
pointed
bodice
stiffened
with
wood
steel
or
whalebone
her
skirt
was
held
out
with
a
petticoat
with
progressively
larger
hoops
there
were
two
layers
of
skirt
with
the
top
one
parted
to
show
the
bottom
one
the
materials
used
were
silks
satins
velvets
and
brocades
on
her
dress
were
quiltings
slashings
and
embroidery
they
were
covered
with
gold
ornaments
pearls
and
gems
from
america
she
wore
decorated
gloves
so
ladies
copied
her
and
discarded
their
simple
for
elaborate
dresses
the
was
now
becoming
a
petticoat
and
the
a
dress
their
became
petticoats
often
they
also
wore
a
fan
with
a
mirror
a
ball
of
scent
a
miniature
portrait
of
someone
dear
to
them
and
sometimes
a
watch

not
wear

but
had
long
flowing
hair
and
low
cut
dresses
showing
their
bosoms

ladies
curled
their
hair
and
wore
it
in
high
masses
on
their
heads
with

interwoven
into

both
gentlemen
and
ladies
wore

both
indoors
and
outside

around
their
necks

discovered
starch
perfume
and
shoes
tight
sleeves
stiffened
and
fitted

and

cloak
were
ornamented
and
their
silk
or
velvet
hats
flamboyant
with
feathers
at
their
leather
belts
they
hung
pouches
and
perhaps
a
watch
they
wore
both
rapiers
swords
with
cutting
edges
and
daggers
daily
as
there
were
many
quarrels
there
were
various
artistic
beard
cuts
and
various
lengths
of
hair
which
was
often
curled
and
worn
in
ringlets
they
now
wore
breeches
and
stockings
instead
of
long
hosen
both
gentlemen
and
ladies
wore
silk
stockings
and
socks
over
them
and
then
boots
coats
dipped
in
boiled
linseed
oil
with
resin
served
as
raincoats
they
wore
nightgowns
to

changed
every

became
old
she
had
a
wig
made
to
match
her
youthful
long
red

spent
much
of

so
many
of
the
women
who
spent
their
days
spinning
were
single
unmarried
women
became
known
as
spinsters
children
wore
the
same
apparel
as
their
elders
they
were
given
milk
at
meals
for
good
growth
it
was
recognized
that
sickness
could
be
influenced
by
diet
and
herbs
sickness
was
still
viewed
as
an
imperfect
balance
of
the
four
elements

only
a

were
of

the
average
house
was
now
four
rooms
instead
of
three
yeomen
might
have
six
rooms
a
weaver
house
had
a

two
bedrooms
and
a

besides
the

farmers
might
have
two
instead
of
one
room
a
joiner
had
a
house
with
a

even
craftsmen
artificers
and
farmers
had
feather
beds
on
bed
frames
with
pillows
and
hung
loom
tapestry
and
painted
cloth
to
keep
out
the
cold
in
their

sheets
richer
farmers
would
build
a
chamber
above
the
hall
replacing
the
open
hearth
with
a
fireplace
and
chimney
poorer
people
favored
ground
floor
extensions
adding
a
kitchen
or
second
bedchamber
to
their
cottages
kitchens
were
often
separate
buildings
to
reduce
the
risk
of
fire
roasting
was
done
on
a
spit
and
baking
in
irons
boxes
placed
in
the

or
in

the
fireplace
mixed
farming
began
in
this
some
of
the
arable
land
produced
food
for
man
and
the
rest
produced
food
for
sheep
cattle
pigs
and
poultry
this
was
made
possible
by
the
introduction
of
clover
artificial
grasses
and
turnip
and
other
root
crops
for
the
animals
since
the
sheep
ate
these
crops
in
the
field
they
provided
manure
to
maintain
the
fertility
of
the
soil
this
meant
that
many
animals
could
be
maintained
throughout
the
winter
instead
of
being
slaughtered
and
salted
more
than
medieval
castles
and
manor
houses
mansions
were
designed
with
privacy
in
mind
the
great
hall
often
hung
around
with
bows
pikes
swords
and
guns
was
not
abandoned
but
the
family
used
it
as
an
eating
place
only
on
rare
occasions
instead
they
withdrew
to
the
parlor
and
great
chamber
while
their
servants
lived
in
turrets
or
attics
and
continued
to
eat
in
the
hall
the
distinction
between
parlor
and
great
chamber
was
that
the
former
was
for
domestic
use
and
the
latter
for
entertaining
parlors
were
situated
on
the
ground
floor
the
family
lived
and
relaxed
there
and
had
informal
meals
in
a
dining
parlor
the
formal
or
state
rooms
were
on
the
first
floor
usually
comprising
a
great
chamber
a
withdrawing
chamber
one
or
more
bedchambers
and
a
long
gallery
the
idea
of
a
long
gallery
was
copied
from
henry
vii
and
was
used
for
exercise
recreation
such
as
music
and
dancing
and
private
conversations
each
room
had
carved
chairs
and
cabinets
a
noble
or
gentleman
house
had
not
only
a
garden
for
the
kitchen
and
orchards
but
formal
gardens
of
flowers
and
scrubs
grown
were
apples
plums
pears
apricots
peaches
walnuts
filberts
almonds
figs
capers
oranges
and
lemons
trees
were
planted
and
grafted
a
noble
lord
made
written
rules
with
penalties
for
his
country
household
which
numbered
about
a
hundred
including
family
retainers
and
servants
he
enforced
them
by
fines
flogging
and
threats
of
dismissal
the
lady
of
the
house
saw
that
the
household
held
together
as
an
economic
and
social
unit
the
noble
family
retainers
guests
and
the
head
servants
such
as
chaplain
and
children
tutor
and
possibly
a
musician
dined
together
at
one
table
the
family
included
step
children
and
married
sons
and
daughters
with
their
spouses
they
drank
from
drinking
of
fine
clear
glass
from
italy
they
ate
from
silver
dishes
with
silver
spoons
chandeliers
of
candles
lit
rooms
a
silver
salt
cellar
was
on
the
table
which
was
covered
with
a
linen
cloth
the
lady
of
the
house
sat
in
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
and
was
served
first
after
the
upper

was
served
the

the
servants
serving
men
and
women
bakers
brewers
cooks
pot
cleaners
laudresses
shepherds
hogherds
dairy
maids
falconers
huntsmen
and
stable
men
what
was
left
was
given
to
the
poor
at
the
gates
of
the
house
the
biggest
meal
of
the
day
was
dinner
served
at
noon
there
were
sandglass
clocks
for
amusement
the
house
was
occasionally
handed
over
to
a
lord
of
misrule
for
twelve
days
clothes
were
washed
in
rivers
and
wells
farmers
wives
used
looms
as
well
as
spinning
wheels
with
foot
treadles
due
to
new
grass
and
root
crops
animals
could
be
kept
through
the
winter
therefore
salted
meat
and
salted
fish
were
no
longer
the
staple
food
of
the
poorer
people
during
the
winter
farm
laborers
ate
soup
porridge
milk
cheese
bacon
and
beer
or
mead
depending
on
the
district
and
dark
barley
or
rye
bread
which
often
served
as
his
plate
gentlemen
ate
wheat
bread
by
basement
services
were
frequently
found
in
town
houses
built
on
restricted
sites
lastly
provision
of
water
supplies
and
improved
sanitary
arrangements
reflected
concern
with
private
and
public
health
there
was
virtually
no
drainage
in
the
case
of
town
houses
some
owners
would
go
to
considerable
effort
to
solve
drainage
problems
often
paying
a
cash
composition
to
the
civic
authorities
but
sometimes
performing
some
service
for
the
town
at
court
or
at
westminster
in
return
for
unlimited
water
or
some
drainage
most
affluent
households
including
the
queen
moved
from
house
to
house
so
their
cesspits
could
be
cleaned
out
and
the
vacated
buildings
aired
after
use
a
few
cesspits
were
made
otherwise
there
was
extensive
burning
of
perfumes
refuse
was
emptied
out
of
front
doors
and
shoveled
into
heaps
on
street
corners
it
was
then
dumped
into
the
river
or
along
the
highways
leading
out
of
town
people

on
perfume
to
avoid
the
stench

built
which
provided
a
clean
latrine
all

round
the
value
of
grain
and
meat
rose
compared
to
wool
grain
became
six
times
its
value
in
the
previous
reign
wool
fell
from
per
tod
in
to
in
so
which
had
taken
about
of
the
arable
land
was
supplanted
somewhat
by
and
the
rural
population
could
be
employed
for
agriculture
in
some
places
the
threefold
system
of
rotation
was
replaced
by
alternating
land
used
for
crops
with
that
used
for
pasture
the
necessity
of
manuring
and
the
rotation
of
crops
and
grasses
such
as
clover
for
enrichment
of
the
soil
were
recognized
wheat
rye
barley
peas
and
beans
were
raised
there
was
much
appropriation
of
common
land
by
individual
owners
by
sale
or
force
many
farms
were
enclosed
by
fences
or
hedges
so
that
each
holder
could
be
independent
of
his
neighbors
red
and
black
currants
rhubarb
apricots
and
oranges
were
now
grown
these
independent
farmers
could
sell
wool
to
clothiers
and
butter
cheese

meat
to
the
towns
they
also
often
did
smithwork
and
ironwork

agricultural
implements

earn
a
day
in

a
day
in

was
about
five
million
population
expansion
had
allowed

secular
education
and
especially
the
profession
of

the
route
for
an
able

poor
person
to
rise
to
power
rather
than
as
formerly
through
military
service
or
through

imposed

could
hold
what
religious
beliefs
they
would
even
atheism
as
long
as
they
maintained
an
outward
conformity
for
instance

to
be
baptized
before

was
difficulty
persuading
educated
and
moral
men
to
be
ministers
the
bible
was
read
at
home
and
familiar
to
everyone
this
led
to
the
growth
of
the
puritan
movement
the
puritans
complained
that
the
church
exerted
insufficient
control
over
the
morals
of
the
congregation
they
thought
that
ministers
and
lay
elders
of
each
parish
should
regulate
religious
affairs
and
that
the
bishops
should
be
reduced
to
an
equality
with
the
rest
of
the
clergy
the
office
of
archbishop
should
be
eliminated
and
the
head
of
state
should
not
necessarily
be
governor
of
the
church
their
ideas
of
morality
were
very
strict
and
even
plays
were
though
to
be
immoral
the
puritan
movement
included
william
brewster
an
assistant
to
a
court
official
who
was
disciplined
for
delivering
upon
pressure
from
the

banking
patents
were
begun
to
encourage
the
new
merchant
lords
to
develop
local
manufactures

for
a
new
manufacture

improved
older
one

its
trades

chartering

merchant
companies

of
exclusive
rights

monopolies

licenses
were
patents
or
copyrights
others
established
trading
companies
for
trade
to
certain
foreign
lands
and
supporting
consular
services
but
there
were
two
detrimental
effects
monopoly
was
a
severe
burden
to
the
middle
and
poorer
classes
and
the
power
of
patent
holder
to
arrest
and
imprison
persons
charged
with
infringing
upon
their
rights
was
extended
to
any
disliked
person
there
was
sharing
of
stock
of
companies
usually
by
merchants
of
the
same
type
of
goods

workers
town
government
was
often
controlled
by
a
few
merchant
wholesalers
the
entire
trade
of
a
town
might
be
controlled
by
its
drapers
or
by
a
company
of
the

the

of
the

as

allowed
a
common

there
were

given
by
groups
of
people
for
losses
of
ships
and
their
goods
there
were
monopolies
on
cloth
tin
starch
fish
oil
vinegar
and
salt
new
companies
were
incorporated
for
many
trades
the
ostensible
reason
being
the
supervision
of
the
quality
of
the
wares
produced
in
that
trade
shoemakers
haberdashers
saddlers
and
curriers
exercised
close
supervision
over
these
wares
they
paid
heavily
for
their
patents
or
charters
there
was
no
sharp
line
between
craftsman
and

merchant
in

an

could
pass
freely
from
one

borrowing
money
for
a
new
enterprise
was
common
industrial
suburbs
grew
up
around
london
and
some
towns
became
known
as
specialists
in
certain
industries
the
building
crafts
in
the
towns
often
joined
together
into
one
company
wrights
carpenters
slaters
and
sawyers
or
joiners
turners
carvers
bricklayers
tilers
wallers
plasterers
and
paviors
these

included
small

the
master
craftsman
often
was
a
tradesman
as
well
who
supplied
timber
bricks
or
lime
for
the
building
being
constructed
the
company
of
painters
was
chartered
with
a
provision
prohibiting
painting
by
persons
not
apprenticed
for
seven
years
the
prosperous
merchants
began
to
form
a
capitalistic
class
as
capitalism
grew
competition
for
renting
farm
land
previously
unknown
caused
these
rents
to
rise
the
price
of
wheat
rose
to
an
average
of
per
quarter
thereby
encouraging
tillage
once
more
there
was
steady
inflation
the
breed
of
horses
and
cattle
was
improved
there
were
specializations
such
as
the
hunting
horse
and
the
coach
horse
dogs
had
been
bred
into
various
types
of
hounds
for
hunting
water
and
land
spaniels
for
falconry
and
other
dogs
as
house
dogs
or
toy
dogs
there
were
no
longer
any
wild
boar
or
wild
cattle
the
turkey
joined
the
cocks
hens
geese
ducks
pigeons
and
peacocks
in
the
farmyard
manure
and
dressings
were
used
to
better
effect
on
the
soil
there
are
locks
and
canals
as
well
as
rivers
at
london
bridge
and
pumps
are
installed
there
are
now
four
royal
postal
routes
from
london
to
various
corners
of
the
nation
horses
are
posted
along
the
way
for
the
deliverer
use
however
private
mail
still
goes
by

there
were
compasses
with
a
bearing

on
a
circular
plate
with

up
to

the
nation
inland
trade
developed
a
lot
there
were
many
more
wayfaring
traders
operating
from
town
inns
there
were
new
industries
such
as
glassware
iron
brasswares
alum
and
coppers
gunpowder
paper
coal
and
sugar
coal
was
used
for
fuel
as
well
as
wood
which
was
becoming
scarce
small
metal
goods
especially
cutlery
was
made
as
well
as
nails
bolts
hinges
locks
ploughing
and
harrowing
equipment
rakes
pitch
forks
shovels
spades
and
sickles
lead
was
used
for
windows
and

copper
and
brass
were
used
to
make
pots
and
pans
pewter
was
used
for
plates
drinking
vessels
and
candlesticks
iron
was
used
for
pots
and
boilers
also
in
use
was
canvas
lead
and
rice
competition
was
the
mainspring
of
trade
and
therefore
of
town
life
parliament
enacted
laws
and
voted
taxes
the
queen
lords
and
commons
cooperated
together
there
was
little
dissension
or
debating
there
were
many
bills
concerning
personal
local
or
sectional
interests
but
priority
for
consideration
was
given
to
public
measures
the
knights
in
the
commons
were
almost
invariably
from
the
county
leading
families
and
chosen
by
consensus
in
the
county
court
the
commons
gradually
won
for
its
members
freedom
from
arrest
without
its
permission
and
the
right
of
punishing
and
expelling
members
for
crimes
committed
tax
on
land
remained
at
of
its
estimated
yearly
income
the
queen
deferred
to
the
church
convocation
to
define
christian
faith
and
religion
thus
separating
church
and
state
functions
the
treasury
sought
to
keep
a
balanced
budget
by
selling
royal
land
and
keeping
crown
expenditures
down
the
crown
carried
a
slight
debt
incurred
before
the
queen
accession
after
exhausting
every
other
alternative
the
queen
agreed
on
the
execution
of
mary
queen
of
scots
for
being
involved
in
a
plot
to
assassinate
her
and
claim
the
throne
of

francis

sailed
around
the

from
to
walter
ralegh
made
an
expedition
to
north
america
in
and
named
virginia
in
honor
of
the
queen
who
was
a
virgin
drake
and
ralegh
plundered
spanish
ships
for
american
gold
and
silver
much
of
which
was
used
to
pay
for
the
war
with
spain
which
planned
to
invade
england
even
after
the
unsuccessful
attempt
by
the
spanish
armada
in
the
two
hundred
english
ships
were
built
to
sink
other
ships
rather
than
to
board
and
capture
them
the
english
guns
outranged
the
spanish
guns
so
the
smaller
english
ships
had
been
able
to
get
close
enough
to
the
big
spanish
galleons
to
shoot
them
up
without
being
fired
upon
the
direction
of
the
wind
forced
the
spanish
galleons
northward
where
most
of
them
were
destroyed
by

the
english

had
been
arbitrarily
pressed
into

circumvented
by

this

sued
the

the

expanded

formerly

are
in

compiled

rather
than
in

books
in

courts
the
action
of
assumpsit
for
enforcing
certain
promises
is
used
more
than
the
action
of
debt
in
those
cases
where
there
is
a
debt
based
on
an
agreement
the
essential
nature
of
consideration
in
contract
is
evolving
from
the
procedural
requirements
for
the
action
of
assumpsit
consideration
may
consist
in
mutual
promises
a
precedent
debt
or
a
detriment
incurred
by
one
who
has
simultaneously
received
a
promise
related
to
the
detrimental
action
consideration
must
be
something
an
act
or
forbearance
of
an
act
that
is
of
value
for
instance
forbearance
to
sue
a
worthless
claim
is
not
consideration
the
abstract
concept
of
contract
as
an
agreement
between
two
parties
which
is
supported
by
consideration
is
developing
as
the
number
of
various
agreements
that
are
court
enforceable
expands
for
instance
the
word
consideration
is
used
in
hayward
case
in
in
the
court
of
wards
on
the
construction
of
a
deed
sir
rowland
hayward
was
seised
in
fee
of
the
doddington
manor
and
other
lands
and
tenements
whereof
part
was
in
demesne
part
in
lease
for
years
with
rents
reserved
and
part
in
copyhold
by
indenture
in
consideration
of
a
certain
sum
of
money
paid
to
him
by
richard
warren
and
others
to
whom
he
demised
granted
bargained
and
sold
the
said
manor
lands
and
tenements
and
the
reversions
and
remainders
of
them
with
all
the
rents
reserved
upon
any
demise
to
have
and
to
hold
to
them
and
their
assigns
presently
after
the
decease
of
sir
rowland
for
the
term
of
years
it
was
held
that
the
grantees
could
elect
to
take
by
bargain
and
sale
or
by
demise
each
of
which
had
different
consequences
in
another
case
a

a

to
be

to
her
on
the
day
of
her
marriage
before
this
day
a
countermanded
it
and
called
home
the
money
it
was
held
in
the
chancery
court
that
c
could
not
recover
because
there
is
no
consideration
why
she
should
have
it
in
a
case
concerning
a
deed
a
sold
land
to
b
for
with
confidence
that
it
would
be
to
the
use

this
bargain
hath
a
consideration
in
itself
and
such
a
consideration
is
an
indenture
of
bargain
and
sale
it
was
held
that
the
transaction
was
not
examinable
except
for
fraud
and
that
a
was
therefore
estopped
a
court
reporter
at
the
king
bench
formulated
two
principles
on
consideration
of
the
case
of
wilkes
against
leuson
as
the
heir
is
estopped
from
falsifying
the
consideration
acknowledged
in
the
deed
of
feoffment
of
his
ancestor
where
a
tenant
in
capite
made
a
feoffment
without
consideration
but
falsely
alleged
one
in
the
deed
on
an
office
finding
his
dying
seised
the
master
of
the
wards
can
not
remove
the
feoffees
on
examining
into
the
consideration
and
retain
the
land
until
and
though
the
heir
tended
still
if
he
do
not
prosecute
his
livery
the
queen
must
admit
the
feoffees
to
their
traverse
and
to
have
the
farm
the
court
reporter
summarized
this
case
as
follows
wilkes
who
was
merchant
of
the
staple
who
died
in
february
last
past
made
a
feoffment
in
the
august
before
his

to
one
leuson
a
knight
and
his
brother
and
another
of
the
manor
of

in
the
county
of
warwick
and
the
deed
seen
for
seven
thousand
pounds
to
him
paid
by
the
feoffees
of
which
sum
he
made
acquittance

together
with
a
clause
of
warranty
to
them
their
heirs
and
assigns
in
forma
proedicta
and
notwithstanding
this
feoffment
he
occupied
the
land
with
sheep
and
took
other
profits
during
his
life
and
afterwards
his
death
was
found
on
a
diem
clausit
extremum
by
office
that
he
died
seised
of
the
said
manor
in
fee
and
one
wilkes
his
brother
of
full
age
found
his
next
heir
and
a
tenure
in
capite
found
and
now
within
the
three
months
the
said
feoffees
sued
in
the
court
of
wards
to
be
admitted
to
their
traverse
and
also
to
have
the
amnor
in
farm
until
and
although
the
said
wilkes
the
brother
had
tendered
a
livery
yet
he
had
not
hitherto
prosecuted
it
but
for
cause
had
discontinued
and
whether
now
the
master
of
the
wards
at
his
discretion
could
remove
the
feoffees
by
injunction
out
of
possession
upon
examination
of
the
said
consideration
of
the
said
feoffment
which
was
false
and
none
such
in
truth
and
retain
it
in
the
hands
of
the
queen
donec
et
quousque
was
a
great
question
and
by
the
opinion
of
the
learned
counsel
of
that
court
he
can
not
do
it
but
the
queen
is
bound
in
justice
to
give
livery
to
him
who
is
found
heir
by
the
office
or
if
he
will
not
proceed
with
that
to
grant
to
the
tenderers
the
traverse
and
to
have
the
farm
the
request
above
mentioned
and
this
by
the
statutes
and
note
that
no
averment
can
be
allowed
to
the
heir
that
the
said
consideration
was
false
against
the
deed
and
acknowledgment
of
his
ancestor
for
that
would
be
to
admit
an
inconvenience
and
note
the
limitation
of
the
use
above
for
divers
doubted
whether
the
feoffees
shall
have
a
in
the
sue
because
the
use
is
not
expressed
except
only
to
themselves
by
their
names
for
ever
but
if
those
words
had
been
wanting
it
would
have
been
clear
enough
that
the
consideration
of
seven
thousand
pounds
had
been
sufficient
for
the
law
intends
a
sufficient
consideration
by
reason
of
the
said
sum
but
when
the
use
is
expressed
otherwise
by
the
party
himself
it
is
otherwise
and
also
the
warranty
in
the
deed
was
to
them
their
heirs
and
assigns
in
form
aforesaid
which
is
a
declaration
of
the
intent
of
wilkes
that
the
feoffees
shall
not
have
the
use
in
fee
simple
and
it
may
be
that
the
use
during
their
three
lives
is
worth
seven
thousand
pounds
and
more
and
suppose
that
the
feoffment
had
been
to
have
to
them
and
their
heirs
to
the
proper
use
and
behoof
of
them
the
feoffees
for
the
term
of
their
lives
for
ever
for
seven
thousand
pounds
would
they
have
any
other
estate
than
for
the
term
of
their
lives
in
the
use
i
believe
not
and
so
in
the
other
case
a
last
example
of
a
case
concerning
consideration
is
that
of
assaby
and
others
against
lady
anne
manners
and
others
the
court
reporter
characterized
the
principle
of
the
case
as
in
consideration
of
his
daughter
marriage
covenants
to
stand
seised
to
his
own
use
for
life
and
that
at
his
death
she
and
her
husband
shall
have
the
land
in
tail
and
that
all
persons
should
stand
seised
to
those
uses
and
also
for
further
assurance
after
the
marriage
he
bargains
and
sell
with
fine
and
recovery
to
one
with
full
notice
of
the
covenants
and
use
this
is
of
no
avail
but
on
the
death
of
the
daughter
and
her
husband
may
enter
the
court
reporter
summarized
this
case
as
follows
was
seised
of
land
in
fee
and
in
consideration
of
a
marriage
to
be
had
between
his
daughter
and
heir
apparent
and
son
and
heir
apparent
of
he
covenanted
and
agreed
by
indenture
with
that
he
himself
would
have
hold
and
retain
the
land
to
himself
and
the
profits
of
during
his
life
and
that
after
his
decease
the
said
son
and
daughter
should
have
the
land
to
them
and
to
the
heirs
of
their
two
bodies
lawfully
begotten
and
that
all
persons
then
or
afterwards
seised
of
the
land
should
stand
and
be
seised
immediately
after
the
marriage
solemnized
to
the
use
of
the
said
for
the
term
of
his
life
and
after
his
death
to
the
use
of
the
said
son
and
daughter
in
tail
as
above
and
covenanted
further
to
make
an
assurance
of
the
land
before
a
certain
day
accordingly
and
then
the
marriage
took
effect
and
afterwards
bargained
and
sold
the
land
for
two
hundred
marks
of
which
not
a
penny
is
paid
to
a
stranger
who
had
notice
of
the
first
agreements
covenants
and
use
and
enfeoffed
divers
persons
to
this
last
use
against
whom
a
common
recovery
was
had
to
his
last
use
and
also
levied
a
fine
to
the
recoverers
before
any
execution
had
and
notwithstanding
all
these
things
continued
possession
in
taking
the
profits
during
his
life
and
afterwards
died
and
the
son
and
daughter
entered
and
made
a
feoffment
to
their
first
use
and
all
this
matter
was
found
in
assize
by
assaby
and
others
against
lady
anne
manners
and
others
and
judgment
was
given
that
the
entry
and
feoffment
were
good
and
lawful
and
the
use
changed
by
the
first
indenture
and
agreement
yet
error
was
alleged
the
judgment
in
the
assize
is
affirmed
the
famous
shelley
case
stands
for
the
principle
that
where
in
any
instrument
an
estate
for
life
is
given
to
the
ancestor
and
afterwards
by
the
same
instrument
the
inheritance
is
limited
whether
mediately
or
immediately
to
his
heirs
or
heirs
of
his
body
as
a
class
to
take
in
succession
as
heirs
to
him
the
word
heirs
is
a
word
of
limitation
and
the
ancestor
takes
the
whole
estate
for
example
where
property
goes
to
a
for
life
and
the
remainder
goes
to
a
heirs
a
life
estate
and
the
remainder
merge
into
a
