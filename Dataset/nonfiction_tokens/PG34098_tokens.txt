introduction
among
the
many
outdoor
occupations
trapping
the
furbearing
animals
is
perhaps
the
most
pleasant
and
in
many
instances
is
also
very
profitable
although
trapping
was
one
of
the
earliest
industries
of
this
country
the
occupation
has
not
passed
away
along
with
the
vanishing
wilderness
for
there
is
more
trapping
done
today
than
at
any
time
during
the
past
scattered
all
over
north
america
in
both
the
thickly
settled
portions
and
the
more
remote
districts
are
thousands
of
trappers
who
are
each
season
deriving
both
pleasure
and
profit
from
this
unique
calling
trapping
in
itself
is
an
art
many
of
the
wild
creatures
are
exceedingly
wary
and
the
trapper
must
match
his
reason
against
the
instinct
the
natural
wariness
and
the
acquired
knowledge
of
the
animals
this
wariness
alone
has
saved
some
species
of
animals
from
extinction
and
although
man
is
superior
to
all
brute
life
such
intelligent
animals
as
the
fox
and
the
wolf
frequently
prove
a
match
for
the
most
expert
of
trappers
in
order
to
be
successful
one
must
know
the
wild
animals
as
a
mother
knows
her
child
he
must
also
know
and
use
the
most
practical
methods
of
trapping
and
it
is
my
object
to
give
in
this
work
the
most
successful
trapping
methods
known
these
modes
of
trapping
the
furbearing
animals
have
for
the
most
part
been
learned
from
actual
experience
in
various
parts
of
the
country
but
i
also
give
the
methods
of
other
successful
trappers
knowing
them
to
be
as
good
as
my
own
i
am
personally
acquainted
with
some
of
the
most
expert
trappers
in
north
america
and
have
also
followed
the
indians
over
their
trap
lines
and
in
this
way
have
learned
many
things
which
to
the
white
man
are
not
generally
known
kreps

chapter
i
the
trapper
art
during
past
ages
many
of
the
wild
creatures
of
the
forest
and
stream
were
hunted
and
captured
in
various
ways
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
wilderness
the
flesh
of
these
animals
being
the
principal
food
of
many
tribes
of
savages
and
the
skins
being
used
for
clothing
but
it
was
only
after
furs
became
a
staple
article
of
wearing
apparel
among
civilized
nations
and
the
traders
had
learned
of
the
profits
to
be
made
in
the
fur
trade
that
wholesale
and
systematic
trapping
began
for
many
years
after
the
commencement
of
the
fur
trade
in
this
country
the
occupation
of
trapping
was
monopolized
by
the
native
inhabitants
but
later
some
of
the
bolder
of
the
white
race
pushed
into
the
wilderness
and
learned
the
trapper
art
there
are
thousands
of
trappers
scattered
over
the
united
states
canada
alaska
and
mexico
and
the
catching
of
wild
animals
for
profit
is
no
longer
considered
to
be
an
occupation
fitting
only
for
the
savage
for
there
is
scarcely
a
farmer
ranchman
or
other
person
whose
calling
brings
him
close
to
nature
who
is
not
more
or
less
interested
in
the
animals
wild
animals
are
not
all
hunted
for
the
sake
of
their
furs
there
are
some
such
as
the
wolf
coyote
mountain
lion
and
which
have
become
positive
nuisances
because
of
their
destruction
of
stock
and
for
such
the
government
and
in
many
cases
the
stockmen
pay
a
bounty
the
capture
of
wolves
and
coyotes
especially
has
become
a
profitable
business
as
to
the
profits
to
be
derived
from
this
occupation
there
are
professional
trappers
in
the
north
south
and
west
whose
catches
amount
to
from
five
hundred
to
two
thousand
dollars
or
more
each
season
but
the
number
who
do
as
well
as
that
is
comparatively
small
by
far
the
greater
number
of
trappers
are
those
who
follow
other
occupations
and
devote
only
their
spare
time
to
the
capture
of
wild
animals
and
they
are
for
the
most
part
farmers
and
country
boys
who
in
this
way
add
considerable
to
their
yearly
income
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
go
into
the
wilds
in
order
to
do
successful
trapping
and
almost
any
farming
section
will
be
found
to
be
a
paying
trapping
ground
indeed
the
country
man
or
boy
will
in
most
cases
do
far
better
in
his
own
home
district
than
he
would
by
going
into
some
place
with
which
he
is
not
familiar
even
though
the
animals
be
more
plentiful
there
than
at
home
in
his
own
territory
he
will
learn
the
haunts
of
each
kind
of
animal
its
route
of
travel
the
dens
and
this
knowledge
will
be
of
great
value
when
the
actual
trapping
commences
of
course
all
of
the
various
species
of
animals
will
not
be
found
in
any
one
section
but
where
one
is
missing
there
will
be
some
other
found
in
fair
numbers
muskrats
are
most
numerous
as
a
rule
in
the
settled
parts
of
the
country
and
wherever
the
muskrat
is
found
there
the
mink
is
also
skunks
are
found
almost
everywhere
and
the
ease
with
which
they
may
be
captured
makes
the
trapping
of
them
a
lucrative
business
foxes
are
found
in
most
of
the
hilly
sections
and
while
they
are
not
so
easily
captured
one
can
make
a
success
of
it
if
he
gives
the
matter
careful
study
and
uses
sufficient
care
in
setting
and
attending
the
traps
in
many
parts
of
the
south
the
raccoon
is
found
in
abundance
as
is
also
the
opossum
and
the
otter
the
wild
cat
and
other
animals
are
found
more
sparingly
in
many
parts
of
the
country
the
trapper
no
matter
where
he
is
located
is
certain
to
meet
with
many
hardships
but
it
is
a
pleasant
calling
for
all
of
that
and
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
in
even
the
roughest
experiences
once
one
has
followed
trapping
for
a
few
seasons
it
is
almost
impossible
to
give
up
the
wild
free
life
the
study
of
the
habits
of
the
wild
creatures
which
is
necessary
if
one
wishes
to
become
a
successful
trapper
brings
one
into
close
touch
with
nature
and
the
work
is
extremely
fascinating
in
the
early
days
before
the
steel
trap
came
into
general
use
the
deadfall
and
the
snare
were
used
almost
exclusively
for
the
capture
of
the
but
at
present
when
steel
traps
have
reached
a
high
state
of
perfection
are
sold
at
prices
which
place
them
within
the
reach
of
all
they
are
preferred
by
most
trappers
and
many
of
the
most
expert
have
discarded
the
wooden
traps
entirely
however
both
the
deadfall
and
the
snare
are
good
traps
for
certain
animals
and
it
is
well
to
know
how
to
make
and
use
them
for
one
may
sometimes
see
a
good
place
in
which
to
place
a
trap
but
may
not
have
a
steel
trap
along
in
such
cases
the
knowledge
of
how
to
construct
a
practical
deadfall
will
be
of
value
it
is
true
that
many
of
the
animals
are
too
cunning
to
be
captured
by
such
a
contrivance
but
some
of
the
most
wary
fall
easy
victims
to
the
snare
some
of
the
most
expert
fox
trappers
use
the
snare
in
preference
to
the
steel
trap
but
the
number
is
comparatively
small
many
styles
of
traps
have
been
invented
and
some
of
the
most
promising
styles
were
placed
on
the
market
but
it
is
doubtful
if
any
trap
will
ever
be
designed
which
will
equal
in
popularity
and
general
usefulness
the
old
time
jaw
trap
commonly
known
as
the
steel
trap
these
traps
have
been
improved
in
many
ways
until
at
present
they
are
almost
perfect
and
are
made
in
sizes
and
styles
to
meet
all
requirements
and
all
conditions
of
trapping
the
jaw
traps
possess
decided
advantages
over
all
other
styles
of
steel
or
wooden
traps
they
are
light
and
compact
and
may
be
moved
from
place
to
place
without
inconvenience
to
the
trapper
will
capture
the
most
wary
animals
as
well
as
the
most
stupid
and
will
work
perfectly
under
all
conditions
whether
set
in
the
water
or
on
dry
land
on
the
snow
or
on
a
log
or
stump
or
the
side
of
a
tree
they
may
be
used
with
or
without
bait
and
if
the
proper
size
of
trap
is
used
and
it
is
set
in
the
right
way
it
will
capture
almost
any
animal
that
comes
that
way
what
other
style
of
trap
possesses
all
of
these
advantages
as
most
of
those
who
have
never
done
any
trapping
know
practically
nothing
regarding
the
use
of
traps
i
will
outline
briefly
the
methods
usually
employed
for
the
capture
of
animals
before
proceeding
farther
most
of
the
animals
which
are
caught
in
traps
are
decoyed
by
means
of
a
bait
something
in
the
line
of
food
which
appeals
to
its
appetite
so
placed
that
in
attempting
to
reach
it
the
animal
places
its
foot
in
the
trap
the
most
common
way
is
by
setting
the
trap
in
the
entrance
to
some
natural
enclosure
such
as
a
hollow
log
or
stump
a
hollow
between
trees
or
a
hole
in
the
rocks
or
under
a
stump
the
bait
being
placed
in
the
enclosure
beyond
the
trap
failing
to
find
a
natural
enclosure
the
trapper
constructs
one
using
such
material
as
may
be
found
on
the
spot
it
is
advisable
as
a
rule
to
make
as
little
disturbance
as
possible
and
to
give
the
enclosure
a
natural
appearance
it
sometimes
happens
that
an
animal
can
not
be
induced
to
approach
a
bait
and
in
such
cases
the
blind
set
is
resorted
to
in
other
words
the
trap
is
set
without
bait
in
a
trail
where
the
animal
travels
or
at
the
entrance
of
its
den
failing
to
find
such
a
place
the
trapper
carefully
studies
the
route
of
the
animal
and
selects
a
place
where
some
natural
or
artificial
obstruction
will
crowd
it
into
a
certain
spot
where
he
carefully
sets
his
trap
in
such
a
way
as
to
catch
the
animal
the
next
time
it
comes
along
these
blind
sets
are
as
a
rule
very
successful
and
many
trappers
use
such
methods
exclusively
in
setting
steel
traps
great
care
is
advised
for
the
one
who
learns
to
do
this
most
neatly
leaving
everything
natural
is
as
a
rule
the
most
successful
one
should
always
be
certain
to
get
the
trap
in
the
right
position
for
to
miss
catching
an
animal
not
only
means
its
loss
for
the
time
being
but
many
of
them
will
become
wiser
from
such
experiences
and
their
capture
will
be
more
difficult
afterwards
the
trapper
is
wise
also
who
gives
sufficient
attention
to
the
fastening
of
the
trap
thus
reducing
the
animal
chances
of
escape
after
it
is
once
caught
to
properly
set
a
steel
trap
on
dry
land
one
should
dig
a
nest
for
the
trap
deep
enough
to
allow
the
covering
to
be
flush
with
the
surroundings
and
just
a
little
larger
than
and
of
the
same
shape
as
the
trap
when
set
this
hollow
should
be
lined
with
dry
leaves
or
moss
and
the
trap
placed
therein
to
make
the
trap
rest
solidly
so
that
there
is
no
danger
of
it
being
tipped
over
also
to
make
the
jaws
set
level
the
spring
should
be
twisted
around
towards
the
jaw
which
is
held
down
by
the
trigger
or
dog
the
trap
should
then
be
covered
with
some
light
dry
material
in
keeping
with
the
surroundings
a
few
dead
leaves
or
a
sheet
of
paper
being
used
first
to
prevent
the
covering
from
rolling
under
the
pan
and
in
that
way
prevent
the
trap
from
springing
instead
of
doing
this
some
trappers
place
a
bunch
of
cotton
or
dry
moss
under
the
pan
but
i
do
not
think
this
advisable
illustration
trap
set
in
correct
position
at
entrance
of
den
in
all
cases
when
setting
traps
at
dens
on
trails
or
at
the
entrances
of
enclosures
the
trap
should
be
so
placed
that
the
jaws
will
be
lengthwise
of
the
animal
approach
so
that
it
will
step
between
the
jaws
and
not
over
one
of
them
if
the
setting
is
reversed
the
rising
jaw
will
sometimes
throw
the
animal
foot
out
of
the
trap
there
are
various
good
methods
of
fastening
and
the
proper
one
to
use
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
surrounding
and
the
species
of
animal
that
one
is
setting
for
water
animals
should
be
drowned
as
quickly
as
possible
after
they
are
caught
and
in
order
to
secure
this
result
the
sliding
pole
is
used
this
is
simply
an
inclined
pole
leading
into
deep
water
and
of
a
size
that
will
enable
the
ring
of
the
trap
chain
to
travel
easily
its
entire
length
the
most
common
way
of
using
the
sliding
pole
is
to
thrust
the
small
end
into
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
fasten
the
other
end
securely
to
the
bank
the
pole
should
have
a
few
branches
near
the
small
end
to
prevent
the
ring
from
sliding
off
all
water
animals
when
caught
in
traps
plunge
into
deep
water
immediately
and
the
ring
of
the
trap
chain
sliding
down
the
pole
makes
it
impossible
for
the
captured
animal
to
again
regain
the
shore
in
order
to
make
this
outfit
more
certain
when
setting
for
large
animals
such
as
otters
and
beavers
a
stone
of
six
or
eight
pounds
should
be
tied
firmly
to
the
chain
but
not
near
enough
to
the
trap
to
interfere
with
the
action
of
the
swivel
in
trapping
for
muskrats
and
mink
the
usual
practice
is
to
simply
stake
the
trap
the
length
of
the
chain
into
the
deepest
water
available
the
weight
of
the
trap
being
sufficient
to
hold
the
animal
under
water
for
land
animals
the
trap
may
be
fastened
to
a
clog
this
is
simply
a
chunk
of
wood
a
pole
brush
or
stone
the
object
being
to
hamper
the
animal
in
its
movements
and
prevent
it
from
getting
a
dead
pull
on
the
trap
and
chain
in
fastening
to
the
clog
the
staple
may
be
used
or
the
chain
may
be
dropped
through
the
ring
so
as
to
form
a
loop
which
is
slipped
over
the
clog
a
few
snags
being
left
stand
to
prevent
the
chain
from
being
drawn
over
the
end
when
setting
for
bears
the
ring
is
slipped
over
the
clog
a
pole
and
fastened
with
a
spike
or
wedge
some
trappers
prefer
to
use
a
pronged
iron
drag
and
this
is
especially
desirable
when
trapping
for
the
more
cunning
animals
such
as
the
fox
coyote
and
wolf
as
the
drag
may
be
covered
without
leaving
much
sign
a
stone
may
be
used
in
the
same
manner
by
securing
with
wire
to
the
end
of
the
chain
for
the
animals
mentioned
the
traps
are
sometimes
staked
down
solidly
the
stake
being
driven
out
of
sight
but
this
gives
the
animal
a
dead
pull
and
they
will
sometimes
escape
such
of
the
as
are
likely
to
escape
by
gnawing
or
twisting
off
a
foot
may
sometimes
be
held
securely
by
the
use
of
the
spring
pole
or
better
still
the
balance
pole
the
spring
pole
is
a
small
springy
sapling
trimmed
of
its
branches
and
planted
firmly
in
the
ground
the
trap
is
fastened
to
the
small
end
which
is
drawn
down
and
held
in
that
position
by
being
hooked
lightly
under
a
crotched
stake
or
a
link
of
the
chain
may
be
hooked
to
a
headless
nail
driven
in
the
side
of
the
stake
in
theory
this
device
works
nicely
but
in
practice
it
is
not
found
to
be
perfect
as
the
wood
will
lose
its
spring
if
kept
bent
for
some
time
especially
in
freezing
weather
illustration
the
balance
pole
the
balance
pole
is
more
faithful
in
its
action
it
is
simply
a
long
slender
pole
fastened
in
a
crotch
or
tied
to
the
side
of
a
sapling
the
trap
being
secured
to
the
small
end
it
is
so
balanced
that
the
weight
of
the
butt
will
not
only
lift
the
trap
but
the
captured
animal
as
well
it
is
fastened
down
in
the
same
way
as
the
spring
pole
and
is
released
by
the
struggles
of
the
animal
in
order
to
keep
steel
traps
in
perfect
working
order
they
should
have
a
certain
amount
of
attention
repairs
will
be
necessary
at
times
and
before
the
trapping
season
commences
one
should
look
them
all
over
and
see
that
they
are
in
good
condition
the
triggers
should
be
so
adjusted
that
the
pan
will
set
level
all
parts
should
work
freely
and
the
trap
should
neither
spring
too
easily
nor
too
hard
rust
on
traps
is
not
desirable
and
may
be
prevented
to
a
great
extent
by
boiling
the
traps
occasionally
in
a
solution
of
evergreen
boughs
maple
willow
or
oak
bark
or
walnut
hulls
this
will
give
the
traps
a
color
and
they
will
not
rust
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
new
traps
will
not
take
the
color
very
well
but
they
should
be
boiled
just
the
same
to
remove
the
oil
also
the
varnish
with
which
some
manufacturers
coat
their
traps
some
trappers
smoke
their
traps
before
setting
believing
that
the
odor
of
the
smoke
will
smother
that
of
the
metal
this
however
is
not
in
my
opinion
a
good
idea
as
clean
iron
has
no
odor
and
the
smell
of
smoke
enables
the
animal
to
locate
the
trap
thus
having
just
the
opposite
of
the
effect
desired
others
again
grease
or
oil
the
traps
which
is
also
bad
for
the
same
reason
and
another
thing
worth
considering
is
the
fact
that
a
greased
trap
does
not
have
as
good
a
grip
as
one
which
has
not
been
so
treated
for
my
own
part
i
would
rather
have
my
traps
red
with
rust
than
to
have
them
oiled
and
if
it
is
necessary
to
oil
the
joints
of
a
stiff
working
trap
use
some
oil
having
practically
no
odor
never
strong
smelling
substances
such
as
kerosene
as
to
the
number
of
traps
that
one
can
handle
this
depends
on
conditions
the
kind
of
animals
that
one
intends
to
trap
for
the
nature
of
the
country
the
method
of
setting
and
tending
traps
the
amount
of
fur
to
be
found
must
all
be
considered
the
muskrat
trapper
who
is
in
a
good
location
where
traps
may
be
set
from
a
boat
or
in
the
marshes
where
muskrat
houses
are
plentiful
as
on
some
parts
of
the
atlantic
coast
can
easily
handle
from
to
a
hundred
or
more
traps
looking
at
them
once
a
day
the
marten
trappers
of
the
northwest
sometimes
use
five
or
six
hundred
traps
but
the
traps
are
not
set
far
apart
and
the
trapper
spends
a
number
of
days
in
going
over
the
line
in
the
thickly
settled
districts
there
are
comparatively
few
who
use
more
than
five
or
six
dozen
traps
for
they
must
be
seen
each
day
and
for
beginners
from
two
to
three
dozen
traps
will
be
sufficient
as
before
mentioned
steel
traps
are
made
in
various
sizes
so
that
they
may
be
used
for
all
animals
from
the
smallest
to
the
largest
the
no
is
the
smallest
size
and
is
intended
for
such
small
animals
as
the
pocket
gopher
the
rat
and
the
weasel
if
the
spring
is
of
fair
strength
as
it
is
in
the
higher
grades
they
may
also
be
used
for
muskrat
and
marten
they
are
used
extensively
by
the
marten
trappers
of
the
rocky
mountain
region
the
no
is
known
as
the
muskrat
trap
and
is
the
best
size
for
this
animal
it
is
also
used
for
mink
skunk
opossum
and
marten
the
no
is
a
very
popular
trap
as
its
size
and
strength
adapt
it
for
general
use
it
is
known
as
the
mink
trap
but
the
tendency
among
trappers
is
to
use
the
for
larger
game
and
the
no
for
mink
it
is
the
best
size
for
skunk
and
if
the
spring
is
of
fair
strength
it
will
hold
the
fox
coon
fisher
and
lynx
as
well
as
all
smaller
animals
the
no
which
is
the
smallest
size
of
the
double
spring
style
is
known
as
the
fox
trap
it
is
also
the
best
size
for
coon
and
is
sometimes
used
for
otter
especially
in
the
north
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
too
small
for
regular
use
on
otter
next
in
order
is
the
no
which
has
been
named
the
otter
trap
and
it
is
the
proper
size
to
use
for
this
animal
it
is
also
used
for
catching
the
coyote
beaver
wild
cat
and
lynx
and
is
a
very
popular
trap
in
the
more
remote
sections
of
the
country
the
no
trap
was
originally
intended
for
the
capture
of
the
beaver
and
is
the
proper
size
for
that
animal
the
higher
grades
of
this
are
also
used
to
a
great
extent
for
trapping
the
timber
wolf
also
for
otter
and
coyote
the
best
trap
for
wolves
however
is
the
which
was
designed
especially
for
trapping
these
animals
it
is
considerably
heavier
than
the
no
and
is
fitted
with
a
longer
chain
and
a
pronged
drag
this
size
is
also
used
for
taking
the
cougar
or
mountain
lion
the
bear
traps
are
known
as
the
no
the
no
and
the
no
the
no
is
the
smallest
but
is
sufficiently
strong
for
the
black
bear
for
those
who
prefer
a
larger
trap
for
this
animal
the
no
will
prove
satisfactory
and
it
will
also
hold
the
grizzly
but
is
rather
small
for
that
animal
the
size
best
adapted
to
the
capture
of
the
larger
varieties
of
bears
is
the
no
which
will
hold
almost
any
living
animal
in
addition
to
the
traps
mentioned
there
are
a
number
of
special
styles
designed
to
meet
the
demand
from
those
trappers
who
desire
special
traps
for
some
certain
animals
among
these
may
be
mentioned
the
clutch
traps
the
single
spring
otter
traps
and
the
traps
with
offset
jaws
it
should
be
understood
that
in
writing
the
foregoing
description
of
traps
i
had
in
mind
the
higher
grades
only
in
the
following
chapters
devoted
to
the
capture
of
the
various
animals
the
proper
sizes
and
brands
of
traps
to
use
will
be
given
illustration
the
skunk
chapter
ii
the
skunk
the
skunk
is
an
animal
of
the
weasel
family
and
is
found
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
southern
parts
of
canada
a
full
grown
specimen
will
usually
measure
sixteen
or
eighteen
inches
from
the
nose
to
the
root
of
the
tail
which
is
about
twelve
or
fourteen
inches
long
and
quite
bushy
the
color
is
a
glossy
black
with
usually
a
white
stripe
extending
from
the
top
of
the
head
to
about
half
the
length
of
the
back
often
this
stripe
is
quite
broad
and
extends
the
length
of
the
body
while
in
others
the
stripe
is
missing
there
being
only
a
white
spot
on
the
head
and
a
white
tip
to
the
tail
this
latter
marking
being
found
on
all
specimens
in
some
of
the
pacific
coast
states
a
variety
is
found
having
only
a
single
white
stripe
running
the
entire
length
of
the
back
there
is
also
a
small
species
found
in
parts
of
the
mississippi
valley
which
has
white
spots
instead
of
stripes
this
animal
is
known
to
the
fur
trade
as
well
as
the
trappers
as
the
civet
cat
although
the
true
civet
cat
is
quite
a
different
animal
the
skunk
has
become
quite
famous
among
country
folks
because
of
its
powerful
scent
which
is
found
in
two
glands
near
the
root
of
the
tail
which
the
animal
can
eject
at
will
this
scent
is
perhaps
the
most
powerful
and
offensive
of
all
odors
and
the
use
of
it
is
the
skunk
only
means
of
defending
itself
against
enemies
the
skunk
makes
its
den
in
the
ground
usually
along
a
gravelly
and
it
sometimes
makes
use
of
the
den
of
the
woodchuck
in
thickly
settled
countries
where
the
dens
have
been
destroyed
by
hunters
they
often
make
their
homes
under
barns
and
and
even
under
dwelling
houses
much
to
the
discomfort
of
the
inmates
the
skunk
is
a
nocturnal
animal
searching
for
food
only
at
night
and
remaining
in
its
den
during
the
day
during
the
cold
part
of
the
winter
they
remain
in
their
dens
coming
out
only
on
warm
nights
until
after
the
middle
of
february
when
their
mating
season
commences
and
the
males
travel
at
this
time
in
almost
all
kinds
of
weather
the
young
are
born
in
april
and
may
and
there
are
usually
from
four
to
ten
in
a
litter
though
occasionally
there
will
be
a
larger
number
their
food
consists
mostly
of
insects
grubs
young
birds
and
eggs
and
when
they
have
an
opportunity
to
do
so
they
will
kill
and
eat
poultry
etc
they
are
also
fond
of
carrion
and
even
the
flesh
of
their
own
kind
in
the
northern
states
the
skunk
becomes
prime
about
the
last
week
in
october
while
in
the
extreme
south
they
are
probably
not
prime
until
the
last
week
in
november
in
the
north
they
commence
to
shed
their
fur
about
the
tenth
or
fifteenth
of
march
while
in
the
south
they
shed
still
earlier
during
very
cold
weather
when
the
skunks
have
been
confined
to
their
dens
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
the
warmth
of
the
dens
has
a
tendency
to
injure
the
fur
the
males
also
fight
among
themselves
and
their
fur
is
often
injured
in
this
way
at
other
times
the
fur
is
spoiled
somewhat
because
of
too
small
an
entrance
to
the
den
the
fur
having
a
rubbed
or
woolly
appearance
it
is
the
fine
black
skins
taken
when
in
the
best
condition
that
are
the
most
valuable
skunks
are
perhaps
found
in
the
greatest
numbers
in
the
eastern
states
and
the
trappers
from
that
section
make
more
money
from
skunks
than
from
any
other
animal
in
winter
one
may
track
them
to
their
dens
and
if
the
den
is
a
good
one
may
find
any
number
of
skunks
up
to
a
dozen
in
the
same
den
it
is
a
common
practice
to
dig
the
den
open
and
kill
all
the
inmates
but
as
this
method
means
the
destruction
of
a
good
den
it
is
not
advisable
to
do
so
the
best
way
is
to
trap
them
as
in
this
way
the
den
will
not
be
injured
and
it
is
almost
certain
that
you
will
find
skunks
in
the
same
den
each
season
such
a
den
is
worth
money
to
the
trapper
the
oil
of
the
skunk
if
rendered
carefully
without
burning
is
useful
and
is
often
used
by
country
people
as
a
remedy
for
croup
the
most
common
method
of
trapping
the
skunk
is
to
set
the
trap
in
the
entrance
of
the
den
without
bait
but
where
there
are
many
dens
or
where
the
dens
are
hard
to
find
it
is
best
to
use
bait
in
setting
the
trap
in
a
den
it
should
be
set
just
inside
the
entrance
unless
the
mouth
of
the
den
is
small
when
it
should
be
set
just
outside
the
trap
should
be
set
with
the
jaws
lengthwise
of
the
hole
so
that
the
skunk
steps
between
the
jaws
and
not
over
them
as
by
stepping
over
the
jaw
the
foot
is
likely
to
be
thrown
out
of
the
trap
by
the
jaw
as
the
trap
springs
this
rule
also
applies
to
all
traps
set
in
dens
or
enclosures
of
any
kind
the
common
way
of
fastening
is
to
stake
the
trap
or
fasten
to
a
clog
but
the
balance
pole
is
better
no
great
care
is
necessary
in
covering
the
trap
as
the
skunk
is
not
suspicious
but
it
is
always
best
to
use
care
especially
in
setting
baited
traps
as
one
never
knows
what
animal
may
come
along
on
one
occasion
i
caught
a
fox
in
a
trap
set
for
skunk
it
is
a
good
idea
also
when
trapping
at
dens
to
put
a
small
scrap
of
bait
inside
of
the
den
as
many
skunks
that
are
traveling
about
only
look
in
and
turn
away
and
if
the
trap
is
set
inside
will
not
be
caught
if
however
there
is
a
small
bait
inside
the
den
the
skunk
will
attempt
to
get
it
and
will
be
caught
in
the
trap
the
traps
most
used
for
skunks
are
the
no
and
no
there
are
also
some
special
traps
manufactured
for
these
animals
having
double
jaws
or
webbed
jaws
to
prevent
the
animal
gnawing
off
its
foot
traps
set
for
skunk
should
be
visited
every
day
as
otherwise
the
captured
animals
are
likely
to
escape
they
seem
to
struggle
more
on
dark
stormy
nights
and
during
such
weather
one
should
get
around
to
his
traps
as
early
as
possible
in
the
morning
sometimes
one
can
find
a
trail
leading
away
from
the
mouth
of
the
den
in
such
a
case
several
traps
may
be
set
in
the
trail
thus
doubling
or
trebling
the
chance
for
a
catch
when
good
dens
can
not
be
found
dig
a
hole
under
an
old
stump
and
place
a
bait
inside
setting
the
trap
directly
in
front
of
the
hole
and
cover
with
dry
dirt
sprinkle
some
scent
about
on
the
stump
and
ground
use
care
in
setting
as
you
are
likely
to
catch
a
fox
providing
the
trap
is
carefully
set
and
covered
and
the
stake
driven
out
of
sight
for
bait
use
tainted
meat
of
almost
any
kind
another
good
way
is
to
find
a
spot
of
sandy
ground
and
set
the
trap
in
a
small
hole
covering
with
sand
cut
the
bait
into
small
pieces
and
scatter
it
all
around
the
trap
also
if
you
have
it
sprinkle
some
scent
around
the
trap
may
be
fastened
to
a
brush
drag
and
the
brush
set
up
to
look
as
though
it
were
growing
there
if
you
can
find
a
tree
or
stump
with
two
spreading
roots
set
the
trap
between
these
roots
and
fasten
the
bait
on
the
side
of
the
tree
about
ten
inches
above
the
trap
still
another
way
is
to
make
a
small
pen
of
old
rotten
wood
stones
or
stakes
setting
the
trap
in
the
entrance
and
placing
the
bait
in
the
pen
beyond
the
trap
any
natural
enclosure
such
as
a
hollow
log
a
hole
in
the
bank
or
in
a
wall
or
pile
of
stones
makes
a
good
place
in
which
to
set
a
trap
skunks
may
also
be
taken
in
box
traps
deadfalls
and
snares
and
they
seldom
become
scented
when
caught
in
such
traps
for
bait
the
following
are
all
good
muskrat
skunk
chicken
birds
of
any
kind
rabbit
squirrel
mice
rotten
eggs
or
fish
tainted
bait
is
always
to
be
preferred
for
skunks
fresh
bait
being
second
choice
to
make
a
good
decoy
take
dozen
rotten
eggs
and
the
scent
of
one
skunk
and
mix
thoroughly
a
mixture
of
the
male
and
female
scent
is
probably
best
many
of
the
decoys
recommended
for
the
fox
are
also
good
for
skunk
the
scent
of
the
skunk
itself
is
one
of
the
very
best
to
use
most
trappers
object
to
having
the
scent
of
skunks
on
their
clothing
and
for
this
reason
i
give
the
following
methods
for
killing
the
captured
animals
so
that
they
will
not
throw
their
scent
if
the
trap
is
staked
or
fastened
to
a
clog
cut
a
club
about
four
or
five
feet
long
and
approach
the
animal
very
slowly
using
care
not
to
make
any
quick
movements
if
the
skunk
raises
its
tail
as
though
it
intended
to
throw
its
scent
stop
and
stand
perfectly
still
until
it
drops
its
tail
again
when
you
can
go
nearer
in
this
way
if
you
are
careful
you
can
easily
get
within
striking
distance
when
you
should
deliver
a
good
smashing
blow
across
the
back
if
the
back
is
broken
the
muscles
which
operate
the
scent
glands
will
be
paralyzed
and
there
will
be
absolutely
no
danger
of
getting
a
charge
of
perfumery
some
trappers
fasten
their
traps
to
the
end
of
a
ten
or
twelve
foot
pole
and
by
approaching
carefully
can
pick
up
the
pole
when
by
going
slowly
the
skunk
may
be
led
to
the
nearest
water
where
it
may
be
drowned
lead
the
skunk
into
shallow
water
gradually
working
it
into
deeper
holding
its
head
under
until
nearly
drowned
then
let
it
have
a
little
air
just
a
breath
and
push
it
under
again
keeping
it
there
until
its
struggles
cease
if
the
animal
is
caught
by
a
front
foot
it
may
be
carried
to
the
water
as
a
skunk
can
seldom
throw
its
scent
if
lifted
off
the
ground
and
not
allowed
to
touch
anything
with
the
hind
feet
or
tail
another
method
is
to
cut
the
animal
throat
with
a
small
very
sharp
pointed
knife
blade
attached
to
the
end
of
a
ten
foot
jointed
pole
approach
the
animal
carefully
and
place
the
point
of
the
knife
against
the
side
of
the
animal
neck
just
over
the
jugular
vein
push
steadily
against
the
knife
as
soon
as
the
blood
flows
freely
move
away
and
allow
the
animal
to
die
perhaps
the
quickest
method
is
to
shoot
the
skunk
in
the
center
of
the
back
with
a
caliber
rifle
or
pistol
this
breaks
the
back
killing
the
animal
almost
instantly
and
there
will
be
no
scent
whatever
if
the
trap
is
fastened
to
a
balance
pole
you
can
kill
the
animal
by
a
blow
across
the
back
never
shoot
them
in
the
head
or
stride
the
head
with
a
club
as
they
are
certain
to
throw
their
scent
if
killed
in
this
way
if
the
fur
of
the
skunk
has
become
scented
i
use
the
following
method
for
removing
the
scent
build
a
fire
and
throw
an
armful
of
evergreen
boughs
on
it
so
as
to
make
a
dense
smoke
hold
the
scented
animal
in
the
smoke
for
about
five
minutes
using
care
to
keep
it
away
from
the
fire
or
the
heat
will
curl
the
hair
after
the
skunk
is
skinned
hang
the
skin
in
an
airy
place
for
a
few
days
when
there
will
be
practically
no
smell
left
before
skinning
or
handling
the
skunk
rub
your
hands
with
some
kind
of
grease
after
the
animal
is
skinned
wash
your
hands
well
using
soap
and
hot
water
there
will
be
no
scent
remaining
on
the
hands
benzine
or
gasoline
will
also
remove
the
scent
from
the
hands
or
clothing
cider
vinegar
is
also
said
to
be
good
if
the
clothing
is
buried
over
night
in
damp
ground
the
scent
will
usually
draw
out
the
track
of
the
skunk
is
peculiar
and
is
not
likely
to
be
mistaken
for
that
of
some
other
animal
although
a
member
of
the
weasel
family
it
does
not
travel
by
a
series
of
jumps
as
does
the
weasel
mink
marten
but
maintains
a
steady
walk
and
the
will
be
an
even
distance
apart
and
spread
considerably
so
as
to
make
a
wide
trail
the
length
of
step
is
about
five
inches
and
the
footprints
will
measure
from
one
to
one
and
a
half
inches
in
length

the
mink
the
mink
is
a
small
carnivorous
animal
belonging
to
the
weasel
family
it
is
found
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
greater
part
of
canada
and
alaska
a
distinct
species
is
also
found
in
europe
and
asia
in
north
america
there
appears
to
be
several
varieties
varying
considerably
in
size
and
color
a
large
variety
is
found
in
the
country
drained
by
the
mississippi
river
and
its
branches
and
also
in
the
prairie
country
of
canada
this
variety
sometimes
reaches
the
weight
of
four
pounds
or
even
more
and
the
skin
when
properly
stretched
will
sometimes
measure
or
inches
from
tip
to
tip
a
smaller
and
darker
variety
is
found
in
the
eastern
states
and
the
eastern
parts
of
canada
and
lake
superior
regions
and
a
still
smaller
and
very
dark
colored
mink
is
found
in
northern
maine
and
parts
of
new
brunswick
a
small
light
colored
variety
is
found
on
the
pacific
coast
the
mink
has
a
long
slender
body
a
small
head
and
rather
short
legs
the
tail
is
usually
about
eight
inches
long
and
is
quite
bushy
the
fur
is
thick
fine
and
glossy
and
the
color
varies
from
a
very
light
brown
to
very
dark
the
usual
color
is
dark
brown
the
fur
on
the
tail
being
darker
than
that
on
the
body
the
mating
season
commences
about
the
last
week
in
february
and
ends
about
the
middle
of
march
the
young
are
born
in
april
there
being
from
four
to
six
in
a
litter
the
mink
is
not
an
amphibious
animal
but
it
is
found
only
along
the
streams
and
watercourses
from
which
it
obtains
a
large
part
of
its
food
it
is
a
great
rambler
traveling
long
distances
along
the
streams
and
lakes
and
always
following
the
same
route
when
on
these
trips
it
explores
the
drifts
and
holes
in
the
bank
hollow
logs
which
habit
is
taken
advantage
of
by
the
trapper
the
fur
of
the
mink
is
at
its
best
during
the
months
of
november
december
and
january
in
the
north
while
in
the
extreme
south
they
are
only
number
one
during
december
and
january
in
february
the
fur
commences
to
fade
and
they
are
not
worth
so
much
the
dark
colored
skins
command
the
best
prices
the
food
of
the
mink
consists
of
fish
frogs
birds
squirrels
mice
rabbits
muskrats
all
of
which
are
good
for
bait
they
are
also
very
fond
of
poultry
the
traps
most
used
for
mink
are
the
nos
and
the
webbed
jaw
and
the
double
jaw
traps
are
especially
desirable
for
mink
as
when
caught
in
these
traps
they
can
not
escape
by
gnawing
off
the
foot
there
are
probably
more
methods
used
in
trapping
the
mink
than
in
trapping
any
other
animal
in
localities
where
they
take
bait
well
the
usual
plan
is
to
set
the
trap
in
the
entrance
to
a
natural
or
artificial
enclosure
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
placing
a
bait
on
the
inside
of
the
enclosure
the
trap
should
be
nested
down
and
covered
with
some
light
material
in
keeping
with
the
surroundings
the
trap
may
be
fastened
to
a
light
clog
or
a
balance
pole
or
if
very
close
to
the
water
to
a
sliding
pole
the
bait
should
be
strictly
fresh
some
good
scent
may
be
used
if
desired
hollow
logs
and
holes
in
drifts
and
under
stumps
make
good
places
for
sets
some
trappers
do
not
set
in
an
enclosure
but
hang
the
bait
about
eighteen
inches
above
the
trap
i
do
not
however
consider
this
a
satisfactory
method
when
an
artificial
enclosure
is
used
it
should
be
roofed
over
with
bark
or
evergreen
boughs
to
protect
that
trap
from
the
snow
for
fall
trapping
many
prefer
to
set
traps
in
the
water
the
following
method
is
one
of
the
best
for
a
water
set
find
a
steep
bank
where
the
water
is
shallow
and
runs
smoothly
and
rapidly
make
a
hole
in
the
bank
on
a
level
with
the
water
making
the
hole
about
ten
inches
deep
and
about
four
inches
in
diameter
put
a
piece
of
fresh
bait
back
in
the
hole
fastening
with
a
small
stick
and
set
the
trap
in
the
water
at
the
mouth
of
the
hole
stake
the
trap
the
full
length
of
the
chain
into
the
water
and
cover
with
mud
or
leaves
along
the
streams
where
little
lead
out
into
the
water
select
a
place
on
one
of
these
bars
where
the
water
is
only
an
inch
or
two
in
depth
set
the
trap
under
the
water
close
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
fix
a
small
fish
on
the
point
of
the
stick
out
in
the
stream
a
foot
from
the
trap
pushing
the
stick
down
until
the
bait
rests
partly
under
water
stake
the
trap
so
that
the
catch
will
drown
this
is
a
very
successful
set
and
requires
but
little
time
and
trouble
to
make
in
some
localities
the
mink
do
not
take
bait
well
in
which
case
blind
sets
traps
without
bait
must
be
depended
upon
in
the
fall
while
the
water
is
still
open
find
a
high
bank
where
the
water
leads
off
fairly
deep
leaving
only
a
very
narrow
strip
of
shallow
water
at
the
foot
of
the
bank
set
the
trap
in
the
edge
of
the
water
and
stake
full
length
of
the
chain
into
the
stream
place
a
couple
of
leaves
on
the
trap
and
drop
a
few
pinches
of
mud
on
them
to
hold
them
in
place
the
steep
bank
on
one
side
and
the
deep
water
on
the
other
will
guide
the
mink
into
the
trap
if
however
the
shallow
water
extends
out
some
distance
from
the
bank
take
a
chunk
of
wood
and
stand
it
in
the
water
just
beyond
the
trap
leaving
the
top
rest
against
the
bank
this
will
leave
only
a
narrow
passage
over
the
trap
and
you
may
be
pretty
sure
of
catching
your
mink
a
similar
set
should
be
made
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
if
conditions
are
favorable
this
is
a
very
good
method
for
use
in
the
south
after
streams
are
frozen
a
different
plan
must
be
adopted
in
such
cases
if
you
can
find
a
jam
or
drift
extending
across
the
stream
find
an
opening
leading
through
this
drift
close
to
the
bank
and
set
the
trap
in
this
opening
covering
with
fine
drift
dirt
in
case
you
can
not
find
a
suitable
passage
make
one
and
stop
up
all
other
holes
a
little
scent
of
the
right
kind
may
be
used
here
to
good
advantage

set
under
log
xx
shows
positions
of
traps
the
illustration
shows
two
traps
set
under
an
old
log
spanning
the
stream
the
log
protects
the
traps
from
rain
or
snow
and
a
glance
at
the
cut
will
show
that
it
would
be
practically
impossible
for
a
mink
to
pass
along
the
stream
without
being
caught
the
same
set
is
good
for
the
raccoon
if
the
stream
is
frozen
fill
the
opening
under
the
log
with
old
dead
brush
so
that
there
is
no
chance
for
the
mink
to
pass
except
over
the
traps
another
good
method
for
the
wary
mink
is
as
follows
find
a
high
steep
bank
along
the
stream
if
it
overhangs
so
much
the
better
and
about
two
feet
above
the
water
make
a
hole
about
four
inches
in
diameter
and
a
foot
or
more
deep
leave
the
dirt
that
you
dig
out
rest
directly
in
front
of
the
hole
and
set
the
trap
in
this
dirt
covering
with
same
pack
dry
moss
around
the
jaws
and
cover
the
trap
first
with
a
sheet
of
paper
finishing
with
a
thin
layer
of
dirt
put
some
good
mink
scent
in
the
hole
the
musk
of
the
mink
itself
is
best
for
this
set
if
the
traps
can
be
visited
every
day
it
is
a
good
plan
to
stake
the
trap
so
that
the
mink
will
roll
around
over
the
ground
and
the
next
one
will
be
more
easily
caught
where
mink
travel
around
a
lake
go
to
the
outlet
and
lay
a
hollow
log
across
the
stream
just
where
the
water
leaves
the
lake
set
a
trap
in
this
log
covering
with
fine
rotten
wood
and
every
mink
that
travels
around
the
lake
will
attempt
to
run
through
the
log
and
will
be
caught
if
you
can
not
find
a
hollow
log
near
at
hand
build
a
covered
of
poles
and
chunks
and
set
your
trap
in
this
passage
mink
may
also
be
taken
in
box
traps
and
deadfalls
scents
are
much
used
and
there
are
some
few
which
have
proved
attractive
fish
oil
is
one
of
the
most
common
scents
for
mink
and
other
animals
it
is
made
by
taking
fish
of
almost
any
kind
cutting
them
into
small
pieces
and
putting
in
a
wide
mouthed
bottle
let
stand
in
a
warm
place
loosely
covered
until
the
fish
are
thoroughly
rotted
and
in
a
liquid
state
this
scent
may
be
used
alone
or
combined
with
others
if
a
female
mink
can
be
caught
during
the
mating
season
remove
the
generative
organs
and
place
them
in
a
bottle
adding
about
two
ounces
of
fish
oil
and
all
of
the
mink
musk
you
can
get
this
is
undoubtedly
the
best
scent
ever
devised
it
should
be
used
without
bait
in
traveling
the
mink
goes
the
jump
and
its
are
always
in
pairs
the
space
between
each
set

it

he
found
the
entire
drove
of
porkers
running
along
the
fence
and
squealing
from
terror
and
following
them
was
a
little
brown
weasel
curiosity
is
highly
developed
in
the
weasel
many
times
i
have
seen
them
in
my
camp
at
night
and
if
i
remained
perfectly
quiet
they
would
approach
to
within
a
few
feet
and
stand
upright
on
their
hind
legs
to
get
a
good
view
at
the
least
movement
however
they
would
disappear
only
to
return
a
minute
later
as
before
mentioned
the
weasel
is
a
creature
and
when
it
finds
some
food
that
is
to
its
liking
it
can
scarcely
be
driven
away
on
various
occasions
i
have
found
them
attempting
to
remove
the
bait
from
my
traps
and
such
times
i
would
adjust
the
trap
so
as
to
be
very
easily
sprung
and
then
step
aside
and
wait
for
the
animal
to
be
caught
the
weasel
has
a
sharp
eye
and
a
keen
nose
while
trapping
in
the
north
i
would
always
keep
on
hand
a
supply
of
snared
rabbits
for
use
as
bait
and
often
weasels
would
come
into
the
camp
at
night
attracted
by
the
bait
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
quickly
they
could
scent
out
the
freshest
rabbit
in
the
pile
and
by
biting
into
its
ears
would
attempt
to
drag
it
away
quite
often
they
were
able
to
move
a
fair
sized
rabbit
i
usually
kept
a
trap
setting
in
my
camp
and
in
this
way
in
one
season
caught
fifteen
weasels
in
one
camp
i
have
never
learned
anything
regarding
the
breeding
habits
of
the
weasel
but
judging
from
the
large
numbers
of
these
animals
found
in
favorable
localities
i
would
say
that
they
are
very
prolific
for
trapping
this
animal
i
recommend
the
no
trap
and
prefer
a
trap
that
is
loosely
hinged
and
springs
easily
such
as
the
victor
any
trap
will
hold
a
weasel
but
when
caught
in
the
smaller
sizes
they
quite
often
double
up
about
the
jaws
and
when
they
die
and
freeze
in
that
position
it
is
difficult
to
remove
them
from
the
trap
with
the
they
are
always
caught
over
the
body
and
there
is
little
trouble
from
that
source
as
the
animal
is
so
very
light
in
weight
it
is
necessary
that
the
trap
springs
very
easily
there
are
various
styles
of
rat
traps
on
the
market
which
make
excellent
weasel
traps
but
as
one
never
knows
what
animal
may
happen
along
i
prefer
to
use
the
steel
trap
my
method
of
setting
is
to
place
the
trap
inside
of
a
small
enclosure
of
chunks
of
wood
bark
sticks
or
whatever
is
most
convenient
no
covering
is
needed
but
when
setting
on
the
snow
i
make
a
bed
of
evergreen
boughs
for
the
trap
to
rest
on
rotten
wood
will
answer
just
as
well
i
fasten
the
bait
with
a
stick
just
back
of
the
trap
so
that
the
weasel
will
be
obliged
to
stand
on
the
trap
when
attempting
to
remove
the
bait
for
it
should
be
remembered
that
they
will
never
eat
any
food
where
they
find
it
if
able
to
move
it
away
fasten
the
trap
securely
for
some
larger
animal
is
likely
to
be
caught
i
do
not
place
the
traps
far
apart
where
tracks
are
seen
in
fair
numbers
and
i
drag
a
fresh
killed
rabbit
from
set
to
set
splitting
it
open
with
a
knife
so
as
to
leave
a
bloody
trail
any
weasel
that
strikes
the
trail
is
sure
to
follow
it
for
bait
i
prefer
rabbit
to
anything
else
as
it
contains
more
blood
than
other
baits
and
fresh
blood
is
the
only
scent
that
i
know
of
which
will
attract
the
weasel
in
order
to
obtain
good
prices
it
is
necessary
that
the
fur
be
kept
clean
and
i
use
a
small
cloth
bag
in
which
to
carry
my
catch
the
tracks
of
the
weasel
resemble
those
of
the
mink
but
are
considerably
smaller
the
average
length
of
jump
is
perhaps
about
eighteen
inches

chapter
the
marten
the
marten
is
a
carnivorous
animal
belonging
to
the
same
family
as
the
weasel
the
principal
species
are
the
pine
marten
of
north
america
the
beech
or
stone
marten
of
northern
europe
the
sable
of
russia
and
siberia
and
the
japanese

naturalists
usually
class
the
fisher
with
the
martens
also
the
russian
sable
is
the
finest
of
the
martens
the
pine
marten
of
labrador
being
next
in
value
the
pine
marten
is
found
throughout
the
timbered
regions
of
canada
and
alaska
also
in
the
mountainous
districts
of
the
western
states
a
few
are
still
found
in
northern
minnesota
wisconsin
michigan
new
york
vermont
new
hampshire
and
maine
in
size
the
marten
is
about
the
same
as
the
mink
of
the
north
and
east
being
somewhat
lighter
in
the
body
but
the
longer
fur
causes
it
to
appear
fully
as
large
it
has
longer
legs
than
the
mink
and
the
feet
are
larger
and
heavily
furred
the
tail
is
thick
and
bushy
the
ears
and
eyes
large
and
the
muzzle
is
more
pointed
than
that
of
the

the
fur
is
very
fine
and
soft
the
color
varying
from
a
rich
yellow
to
almost
black
the
fur
of
the

is
darker
than
that
of
the

and
the
face
lighter
the

there
is
always

the
martens
are
quite
pale
the
finest

skins
come
from
labrador
and
the
country
east
and
south
of
hudson
bay
also
from
northern
british
columbia
and
the
interior
of
alaska
and
the
yukon
province
the
marten
is
strictly
an
animal
of
the
woods
being
found
only
in
the
heavily
timbered
country
their
favorite
haunts
are
in
the
rough
broken
country
where
the
timber
is
of
various
kinds
they
feed
on
rabbits
squirrels
mice
birds
and
eggs
and
probably
have
no
trouble
in
obtaining
a
sufficient
amount
of
food
but
unlike
the
mink
and
the
weasel
they
never
kill
more
than
is
needed
to
supply
their
wants
the
young
are
usually
born
in
april
and
there
are
from
three
to
five
at
a
birth
just
where
they
make
their
dens
i
can
not
say
some
writers
say
they
live
in
hollow
trees
while
others
assert
that
they
live
in
holes
in
the
rocks
or
ground
i
should
say
that
the
latter
idea
is
most
likely
to
be
correct
at
least
as
regards
the
marten
of
the
far
north
as
in
that
part
of
the
country
hollow
trees
are
few
and
far
between
one
peculiarity
regarding
the
martens
is
the
fact
that
they
occasionally
disappear
from
a
locality
in
which
they
were
formerly
numerous
the
common
supposition
is
that
they
migrate
to
new
feeding
grounds
when
food
becomes
scarce
the
marten
travels
mostly
in
the
gullies
and
depressions
on
the
mountains
and
hills
as
they
usually
follow
the
same
route
when
one
sees
their
tracks
in
such
a
place
he
can
be
reasonably
sure
if
he
sets
his
trap
there
that
he
will
make
a
catch
they
are
not
shy
or
suspicious
and
are
easily
caught
in
many
ways
marten
trapping
is
the
most
pleasant
as
well
as
the
most
profitable
kind
of
trapping
as
they
are
found
only
in
the
timbered
country
the
trapper
does
not
feel
the
storms
like
he
would
in
an
open
country
they
are
easily
caught
light
to
carry
and
easily
skinned
moreover
they
are
a
very
valuable
fur
and
if
one
is
in
a
good
locality
he
will
make
a
large
catch
in
a
season
they
usually
become
prime
about
the
of
october
and
remain
in
good
condition
until
the
last
of
march
in
countries
where
the
snow
does
not
fall
too
deep
the
traps
are
set
in
small
enclosures
the
same
as
for
the
mink
if
there
is
snow
on
the
ground
i
set
my
traps
as
follows
with
my
snowshoes
i
tramp
the
snow
down
solid
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
and
build
a
small
pen
of
stakes
or
chunks
split
from
an
old
stump
the
stakes
or
chunks
are
arranged
so
as
to
form
the
sides
of
the
pen
and
the
sides
are
placed
about
six
or
seven
inches
apart
the
tree
forming
the
back
of
the
pen
i
roof
the
pen
with
evergreen
boughs
to
protect
the
trap
from
the
falling
snow
it
is
a
good
idea
to
leave
a
couple
of
boughs
hang
down
over
the
mouth
of
the
pen
so
as
to
hide
the
bait
from
the
birds
and
also
to
prevent
the
rabbits
from
entering
the
pen
i
set
the
trap
on
a
bed
of
boughs
just
inside
of
the
pen
and
cover
lightly
with
tips
of
evergreen
the
bait
is
placed
on
a
stick
behind
the
trap
i
fasten
the
trap
to
a
toggle
but
if
only
marten
is
expected
the
trap
may
be
fastened
in
almost
any
way
as
they
seldom
escape
it
is
also
a
good
idea
to
bend
a
small
twig
and
place
it
under
the
pan
of
the
trap
to
prevent
it
from
being
sprung
by
birds
squirrels
and
weasels
for
bait
rabbit
partridge
squirrel
fish
small
birds
or
meat
of
almost
any
kind
is
good
the
indians
sometimes
salmon
pickerel
or
white
fish
for
marten
bait
and
other
trappers
use
putrefied
salmon
roe
but
the
majority
prefer
to
use
fresh
bait
some
trappers
advise
dragging
a
piece
of
fresh
bloody
meat
along
the
line
to
lead
the
marten
to
the
trap
illustration
a
marten
set
another
very
good
method
is
the
following
find
a
small
spruce
about
three
inches
in
diameter
and
cut
the
tree
about
two
feet
above
the
snow
leaving
the
top
of
the
stump
v
shape
draw
the
tree
forward
and
lay
it
over
the
stump
so
that
the
butt
of
the
tree
will
be
three
or
three
and
a
half
feet
above
the
snow
now
about
a
foot
back
from
the
end
flatten
off
a
place
for
the
trap
and
set
the
trap
on
the
pole
tie
the
trap
fast
with
a
light
string
and
loop
the
chain
around
the
tree
split
the
butt
of
the
tree
and
fasten
the
bait
in
the
split
this
is
a
very
good
set
possessing
advantages
over
most
methods
the
birds
can
not
eat
the
bait
the
trap
is
not
bothered
by
weasels
or
rabbits
the
marten
must
stand
on
the
trap
when
trying
to
get
the
bait
and
when
caught
falls
off
the
pole
and
can
not
get
back
in
the
mountains
where
the
snow
falls
deep
the
traps
are
set
on
the
trees
five
or
six
feet
above
the
snow
the
most
common
way
is
to
make
two
cuts
in
the
tree
with
an
axe
and
drive
in
two
wooden
pegs
about
five
inches
apart
set
the
trap
and
place
it
on
the
pegs
one
peg
passing
through
the
bow
of
the
spring
the
other
between
the
jaws
and
the
bottom
of
the
trap
draw
the
chain
around
the
tree
and
staple
solidly
the
bait
is
pinned
to
the
tree
about
a
foot
above
the
trap
a
bunch
of
boughs
may
be
placed
over
the
bait
to
hide
it
from
the
birds
if
desired
a
notch
may
be
cut
in
the
tree
and
a
trap
set
in
the
notch
the
notch
should
be
about
four
inches
deep
and
about
twelve
inches
from
top
to
bottom
cut
the
bottom
smooth
so
the
trap
will
set
solid
and
fasten
the
bait
in
the
top
of
the
notch
staple
the
trap
to
the
tree
if
desired
you
can
lean
a
pole
against
the
tree
for
the
marten
to
run
up
on
but
this
is
not
necessary
the
trapper
should
always
be
on
the
lookout
for
places
in
which
the
trap
may
be
set
without
much
labor
sometimes
a
tree
can
be
found
with
a
hollow
in
one
side
and
this
makes
a
good
place
for
a
set
lean
a
pole
against
the
tree
with
one
end
resting
in
the
hollow
set
a
trap
on
the
pole
and
place
a
bait
in
the
cavity
above
the
trap
at
other
times
a
cavity
may
be
made
in
the
side
of
a
rotten
stub
and
a
trap
set
in
the
same
way
the
traps
recommended
for
marten
are
the
no
of
any
make
but
the
no
newhouse
is
much
used
if
there
are
fishers
lynx
and
other
large
animals
about
it
is
best
to
use
a

deadfalls
are

or
on
the
top
of
a

usually
the
fisher
is
easily
trapped
and
will
enter
the
trap
as
readily
as
the
marten
but
there
are
off
seasons
when
food
is
plenty
and
the
animals
are
rather
shy
on
such
occasions
i
have
seen
them
refuse
to
cross
my
trail
in
the
snow
in
most
cases
however
they
will
jump
into
the
trail
and
follow
it
to
the
trap
when
trapped
the
animal
struggles
violently
and
if
the
leg
is
broken
is
likely
to
twist
off
the
foot
and
escape
it
will
also
chew
up
everything
within
reach
and
the
traps
must
be
well
fastened
the
use
of
a
balance
pole
is
advised
but
where
for
any
reason
it
can
not
be
used
the
traps
should
be
fastened
to
a
heavy
log
the
most
common
method
for
trapping
the
fisher
is
by
setting
a
trap
in
a
pen
of
stakes
or
a
natural
enclosure
the
same
as
recommended
for
marten
but
the
pen
should
be
larger
it
should
be
two
feet
high
wide
at
the
top
and
just
wide
enough
for
the
trap
at
the
bottom
the
bait
should
be
placed
on
a
stick
in
the
back
of
the
pen
and
the
trap
should
be
covered
with
some
light
material
the
pen
should
be
roofed
with
evergreen
boughs
to
protect
the
trap
from
the
snow
it
is
the
custom
among
the
indian
trappers
to
make
the
trap
pen
of
green
wood
splitting
it
and
placing
the
stakes
so
that
the
split
side
will
be
inward
the
object
in
this
is
to
enable
the
animal
to
more
easily
locate
the
bait
for
sometimes
when
the
fisher
scents
the
bait
but
can
not
find
it
at
once
he
moves
on
if
however
the
pen
presents
a
bright
interior
it
attracts
the
animal
attention
and
leads
to
an
investigation
this
method
is
used
generally
but
should
not
be
employed
when
setting
for
the
more
wary
animals
the
indians
also
at
times
hang
the
bait
by
a
piece
of
light
wire
in
preference
to
placing
on
a
stick
this
is
so
that
the
little
can
not
reach
and
destroy
the
bait
and
i
have
found
it
to
be
a
very
good
plan
a
small
twig
should
be
placed
under
the
pan
of
the
trap
to
prevent
squirrels
and
birds
from
springing
it
for
trapping
the
fisher
i
recommend
the
no
traps
of
all
makes
also
the
no
victor
and
oneida
jump
traps
charles
carner
a
noted
trapper
of
california
uses
the
following
method
find
somewhere
on
the
fisher
route
of
travel
a
small
bushy
evergreen
tree
with
limbs
coming
down
to
the
ground
cut
away
a
few
of
the
limbs
on
one
side
so
as
to
make
a
sort
of
enclosure
the
limbs
that
are
cut
away
should
be
stuck
in
at
the
sides
and
back
to
make
the
pen
tighter
the
bait
should
be
tied
to
the
stem
of
the
tree
and
the
trap
set
a
short
distance
in
front
of
the
bait
so
as
to
catch
the
animal
by
the
fore
foot
the
trap
is
fastened
securely
to
the
butt
of
the
tree
carner
recommends
the
use
of
the
following
scent
fish
oil
oil
of
anise
assafoetida
and
muskrat
musk
thoroughly
mixed
he
saturates
a
rabbit
with
the
scent
and
draws
it
from
trap
to
trap
and
on
the
last
trap
uses
the
rabbit
for
bait
this
scent
is
also
used
by
some
other
noted
trappers
i
have
also
caught
fishers
by
building
a
pen
on
an
old
log
lying
with
one
end
above
the
ground
i
would
make
some
splits
in
the
log
with
my
axe
drive
in
a
few
stakes
and
weave
evergreen
boughs
among
the
stakes
roofing
the
pen
with
boughs
the
trap
should
be
set
the
same
as
in
the
first
method
and
should
be
stapled
to
the
top
of
the
log
so
that
when
the
animal
jumps
off
on
either
side
he
can
not
get
his
front
feet
or
the
trap
down
to
the
ground
the
above
methods
are
all
very
good
but
if
a
particularly
shy
animal
refuses
to
enter
the
pen
try
setting
in
a
natural
enclosure
and
if
this
fails
try
the
following
method
under
some
thick
evergreen
tree
scrape
up
a
cone
shaped
pile
of
snow
making
it
two
feet
high
and
pack
the
snow
solid
have
the
trap
fastened
to
a
clog
and
bury
the
clog
in
the
snow
in
the
very
top
of
the
mound
hollow
out
a
place
for
the
trap
and
line
this
place
with
evergreen
tips
set
the
trap
in
this
nest
cover
it
with
a
piece
of
paper
and
brush
a
half
inch
of
snow
lightly
over
the
paper
for
bait
use
a
whole
partridge
or
rabbit
and
hang
it
by
a
string
from
a
limb
of
the
tree
so
that
it
hangs
about
two
and
a
half
feet
above
the
trap
brush
your
tracks
shut
with
a
bunch
of
boughs
and
when
looking
at
the
trap
do
not
go
too
close
this
method
is
very
good
for
the
shy
ones
but
is
too
much
trouble
to
use
as
a
regular
set
when
putting
out
a
long
line
of
traps
the
best
places
in
which
to
set
for
fishers
is
in
the
timbered
ravines
especially
where
two
ravines
join
other
good
places
are
at
the
ends
of
lakes
the
points
of
swamps
and
in
narrow
strips
of
timber
connecting
larger
bodies
the
track
of
the
fisher
is
very
similar
to
that
of
the
marten
but
is
larger
the
length
of
jump
is
about
three
feet
and
the
footprints
from
one
and
a
half
to
two
inches
in
length

chapter
vii
the
otter
the
otter
is
a
carnivorous
animal
somewhat
resembling
the
mink
in
appearance
they
are
found
in
various
parts
of
the
world
and
will
be
met
with
in
most
of
the
wilder
parts
of
north
america
the
northern
or
canadian
otter
is
the
most
common
but
there
are
other
varieties
known
as
the
carolina
otter
the
florida
otter
and
the
newfoundland
otter
in
habits
and
general
appearance
they
are
all
similar
a
distinct
species
is
found
in
the
north
pacific
and
is
known
as
the
sea
otter
this
animal
is
considerably
larger
than
the
fresh
water
species
and
has
a
shorter
tail
the
fur
is
of
great
value
the
otter
is
an
aquatic
animal
living
in
and
near
the
streams
and
lakes
and
getting
its
living
from
them
it
has
a
long
body
short
stout
legs
and
webbed
feet
the
tail
is
long
thick
at
the
base
and
tapering
to
a
point
the
neck
is
thick
the
head
comparatively
small
with
small
ears
set
well
down
on
the
sides
of
the
head
the
fur
is
of
two
kinds
the
under
fur
being
fine
soft
and
wavy
and
of
a
light
silvery
color
while
the
outer
fur
or
guard
hairs
are
longer
coarser
and
usually
straight
the
color
varying
from
brown
to
almost
black
the
fur
of
the
tail
and
under
parts
is
shorter
and
stiffer
than
that
on
the
back
sides
and
neck
that
on
the
under
parts
having
a
silvery
tint
otters
frequently
measure
three
and
feet
in
length
and
weigh
from
fifteen
to
pounds
the
skin
when
stretched
will
often
measure
five
feet
from
tip
to
tip
and
sometimes
even
more
the
food
of
the
otter
consists
principally
of
fish
trout
being
their
favorite
food
but
they
also
feed
on
muskrats
clams
frogs
and
the
smaller
animal
life
found
in
the
beds
of
streams
and
lakes
they
capture
muskrats
by
entering
their
houses
and
their
holes
in
the
banks
otters
usually
make
burrows
in
the
banks
of
streams
lining
the
nest
with
leaves
and
grass
the
entrances
to
these
burrows
are
under
the
water
and
it
is
my
belief
that
they
inhabit
them
only
during
the
breeding
season
the
young
are
born
in
april
and
may
and
there
are
from
two
to
four
in
a
litter
the
otter
is
a
great
traveler
following
the
lakes
and
water
courses
sometimes
going
a
distance
of
one
hundred
miles
on
a
single
trip
apparently
he
is
always
in
a
great
hurry
to
reach
a
certain
place
some
lake
or
pond
at
which
having
reached
he
may
remain
for
several
months
and
again
he
may
leave
immediately
after
his
arrival
otters
sometimes
have
slides
on
the
banks
of
streams
down
which
they
slide
into
the
water
apparently
for
pastime
they
also
have
landing
places
on
the
banks
of
streams
and
on
logs
projecting
into
the
water
where
they
go
to
roll
in
the
grass
and
leaves
or
to
lie
in
the
sun
these
places
are
seldom
visited
in
the
fall
but
in
the
spring
they
will
land
at
almost
every
place
as
they
come
along
in
traveling
they
usually
follow
the
center
of
the
stream
as
they
are
more
at
home
in
the
water
than
on
land
in
winter
they
travel
under
the
ice
wherever
the
water
is
deep
enough
to
allow
of
their
passage
the
otter
legs
being
very
short
he
has
a
peculiar
method
of
traveling
on
the
ice
or
snow
he
throws
himself
forward
sliding
on
his
belly
and
by
repeating
the
move
in
rapid
succession
is
enabled
to
get
along
at
a
surprising
rate
of
speed
wherever
there
is
a
sharp
bend
in
the
stream
the
otter
will
make
a
short
cut
across
the
point
and
if
the
stream
is
traveled
much
you
will
find
a
trail
in
such
a
place
where
two
streams
lie
close
together
they
sometimes
have
a
trail
from
one
stream
to
another
also
wherever
a
long
point
of
land
projects
into
a
lake
they
are
likely
to
have
a
trail
across
the
point
the
otter
appears
to
be
on
very
friendly
terms
with
the
beaver
and
if
there
are
any
beavers
in
the
country
the
otter
is
sure
to
find
them
and
will
spend
considerable
time
in
the
same
pond
when
there
are
a
number
of
families
of
beavers
in
the
same
locality
the
otter
will
spend
nearly
all
of
its
time
with
the
beavers
visiting
from
one
family
to
another
wherever
he
finds
beaver
cutting
along
the
stream
he
examines
it
and
will
most
likely
follow
up
the
stream
to
find
the
beaver
this
habit
is
taken
advantage
of
by
the
indian
trappers
of
the
north
as
will
be
explained
later
in
the
north
the
otter
becomes
prime
about
the
first
week
in
november
and
remains
in
good
condition
until
about
the
first
of
june
in
the
south
they
are
seldom
prime
until
the
first
of
december
and
commence
to
shed
from
the
first
to
the
fifteenth
of
april
the
fur
of
the
otter
is
valuable
the
dark
straight
haired
ones
being
worth
the
most
occasionally
an
otter
is
found
having
a
decided
curl
to
the
ends
of
the
hair
the
ends
being
turned
forward
these
are
called
curly
otters
and
are
not
near
so
valuable
as
the
others
otters
are
found
in
good
numbers
in
the
swamps
of
the
southern
states
in
florida
arkansas
mississippi
louisiana
and
the
lowlands
of
texas
they
are
also
quite
plentiful
in
some
parts
of
massachusetts
new
hampshire
vermont
and
maine
also
in
the
wilds
of
labrador
ungava
quebec
ontario
yukon
mackenzie
and
alaska
the
most
valuable
otters
come
from
the
far
north
but
they
are
probably
more
plentiful
in
the
south
and
the
southern
trapper
has
the
advantage
of
having
open
water
all
winter
the
best
traps
for
otter
are
the
numbers
and
newhouse
the
nos
and
hawley
norton
and
the
no
oneida
jump
also
the
seminole
pattern
blake
lamb
the
point
to
keep
in
mind
when
trapping
for
otter
is
that
they
are
very
shy
of
the
scent
of
man
more
so
perhaps
than
any
other
animal
and
unless
great
care
is
observed
are
likely
to
be
frightened
entirely
out
of
the
locality
in
which
you
are
trapping
this
human
scent
theory
is
disputed
by
some
trappers
but
i
speak
from
my
own
experience
and
from
the
experience
of
many
expert
trappers
with
whom
i
am
acquainted
if
one
will
use
a
little
judgment
he
will
readily
understand
why
human
scent
is
alarming
to
many
wild
animals
man
is
the
natural
enemy
of
all
wild
animal
life
and
all
wild
creatures
realize
this
fact
now
you
will
see
that
any
indications
of
the
presence
of
man
puts
the
animal
on
its
guard
especially
is
this
the
case
in
the
wilderness
where
the
animals
are
not
accustomed
to
seeing
the
tracks
of
man
wherever
they
go
when
an
animals
finds
human
scent
he
has
positive
proof
that
man
has
been
in
that
vicinity
footprints
and
other
human
signs
if
there
is
no
scent
are
not
so
alarming
as
they
are
likely
to
be
mistaken
for
signs
made
by
some
wild
animal
although
the
animals
of
the
wilderness
are
more
afraid
of
human
scent
than
those
found
in
the
settled
countries
they
are
just
as
easily
trapped
the
more
wary
animals
found
in
settled
parts
are
always
looking
for
danger
because
of
the
continued
presence
of
man
in
their
locality
but
on
the
other
hand
they
are
not
likely
to
be
frightened
by
human
scent
because
it
is
a
common
thing
to
them
as
mentioned
before
the
otter
is
sure
to
visit
the
beavers
if
there
are
any
about
so
if
you
know
of
a
family
of
beavers
go
to
that
place
and
if
you
can
find
an
old
beaver
dam
on
the
stream
somewhere
below
where
the
beavers
are
located
make
a
break
in
the
center
of
this
dam
so
that
all
of
the
water
will
flow
through
this
opening
and
set
the
trap
in
the
water
in
the
upper
end
of
this
passage
narrow
down
the
passage
to
about
eight
inches
by
driving
a
few
old
stakes
on
each
side
of
the
trap
the
trap
may
be
staked
but
it
is
better
if
the
water
is
deep
enough
to
use
a
sliding
pole
so
that
the
captured
animal
will
drown
no
covering
is
needed
on
the
trap
but
after
it
is
set
the
entire
setting
should
be
drenched
with
water
to
remove
the
human
scent
this
is
an
excellent
set
and
will
remain
in
working
order
until
late
in
the
fall
as
the
water
immediately
above
the
break
in
the
dam
will
not
freeze
until
long
after
other
water
is
closed
by
ice
even
in
the
coldest
weather
this
set
may
be
kept
from
freezing
by
roofing
it
over
with
evergreen
boughs
and
banking
it
well
with
snow
beavers
and
beaver
dams
are
not
found
in
every
locality
but
wherever
otters
are
found
traveling
on
small
streams
they
may
be
trapped
in
the
following
manner
find
a
narrow
place
in
the
stream
where
the
water
flows
smoothly
and
narrow
up
the
stream
by
placing
a
bunch
of
old
dead
brush
in
each
side
leaving
a
passage
of
about
eight
inches
in
the
middle
lay
a
few
stones
among
the
brush
to
keep
them
in
place
set
the
trap
in
the
opening
and
splash
water
over
the
brush
and
banks
the
trap
may
be
staked
but
it
is
better
to
fasten
to
a
clog
cut
a
small
sapling
of
such
a
size
that
the
ring
of
the
chain
will
just
pass
over
the
butt
of
the
sapling
slip
the
ring
over
the
clog
and
fasten
it
by
splitting
the
butt
and
drive
a
wedge
in
the
split
or
by
driving
a
staple
over
the
ring
the
clog
may
be
placed
on
the
upper
side
of
the
brush
used
to
block
the
stream
and
the
top
may
be
tied
to
the
shore
so
that
it
will
not
be
carried
away
by
high
water
in
very
small
streams
a
narrow
passage
may
be
made
by
simply
placing
a
few
stones
in
either
side
leaving
a
narrow
passage
in
the
middle
in
which
to
set
the
trap
when
you
can
find
a
sharp
bend
in
the
stream
with
a
trail
across
the
point
set
the
trap
in
the
water
at
the
end
of
the
trail
use
same
care
as
advised
for
the
other
sets
for
spring
trapping
this
method
is
excellent
if
you
can
find
one
of
the
otter
landing
places
on
the
bank
prepare
the
place
for
setting
in
the
fall
in
the
following
manner
make
a
nest
for
the
trap
in
the
center
of
the
trail
and
fill
the
nest
with
grass
and
leaves
lay
a
bunch
of
dead
brush
or
a
chunk
of
rotten
wood
on
each
side
of
the
trail
so
as
to
leave
only
a
narrow
passage
and
cut
a
clog
and
lay
it
in
place
the
otters
seldom
visit
these
places
in
the
fall
so
there
is
no
danger
of
frightening
them
in
the
spring
before
the
snow
is
all
gone
go
and
set
your
trap
in
the
place
prepared
covering
with
the
leaves
and
grass
and
attach
to
the
clog
covering
the
entire
setting
with
a
little
snow
as
the
snow
melts
it
takes
with
it
all
of
the
scent
and
signs
leaving
the
trap
ready
for
the
first
otter
that
comes
along
if
you
do
not
find
the
landing
places
until
after
the
snow
is
gone
set
the
traps
just
the
same
washing
the
scent
away
by
sprinkling
with
water
or
set
the
traps
in
the
water
where
the
otter
climbs
up
the
bank
illustration
otter
trap
set
under
ice
another
very
good
method
for
spring
trapping
is
to
set
the
trap
in
the
edge
of
the
water
where
the
bank
bluffs
a
little
sticking
up
a
few
fresh
cut
green
sticks
behind
the
trap
and
at
the
sides
post
a
piece
of
the
dried
oil
castor
of
the
beaver
on
a
stick
behind
the
trap
and
about
ten
inches
high
the
ordinary
beaver
castor
is
also
good
the
oil
castor
is
very
attractive
to
the
otter
and
the
green
sticks
are
also
attractive
as
the
otter
mistakes
them
for
beaver
cutting
always
fasten
the
trap
so
the
animal
will
drown
as
you
are
likely
to
catch
a
beaver
in
this
set
one
of
the
best
methods
of
trapping
otter
in
winter
after
the
streams
are
closed
with
ice
is
as
follows
find
a
long
pool
of
still
water
where
you
are
sure
the
otter
will
be
traveling
under
the
ice
and
at
either
end
of
this
pool
where
the
water
is
about
ten
inches
deep
cut
a
hole
through
the
ice
make
a
pen
of
dead
sticks
in
the
water
making
the
pen
about
nine
inches
wide
by
twelve
or
fifteen
inches
deep
now
take
a
fish
and
fasten
it
to
a
stick
in
the
back
of
the
pen
and
set
the
trap
in
the
entrance
staking
it
securely
drive
the
stake
about
ten
inches
in
front
of
the
pen
and
directly
in
front
of
the
trap
the
object
in
this
is
to
cause
the
otter
in
entering
to
twist
his
body
in
which
act
he
will
put
his
foot
down
in
the
trap
throw
some
snow
in
the
hole
so
it
will
freeze
over
the
bait
should
be
renewed
once
a
week
in
case
you
can
not
get
fish
for
bait
use
the
head
of
a
rabbit
the
breast
of
a
partridge
or
a
piece
of
muskrat
the
bait
should
be
skinned
the
otter
will
also
be
attracted
by
any
white
object
i
know
a
trapper
who
caught
one
in
this
way
by
baiting
with
a
white
door
knob
and
the
indians
sometimes
use
a
piece
of
fresh
peeled
poplar
for
bait
if
the
ice
has
formed
when
the
water
was
above
its
usual
level
there
will
be
an
air
space
between
the
water
and
the
ice
in
such
a
case
cut
a
hole
through
the
ice
at
the
edge
of
the
water
placing
a
piece
of
beaver
castor
on
a
stick
behind
the
trap
the
hole
may
be
closed
by
covering
with
a
block
of
ice
when
the
otter
has
been
working
on
a
lake
for
some
time
you
will
find
where
he
has
been
coming
out
at
the
springholes
which
are
found
on
nearly
all
lakes
in
such
places
the
water
is
always
shallow
and
a
trap
may
be
set
on
the
bottom
directly
under
the
hole
great
care
must
be
used
however
for
if
the
otter
is
not
caught
the
first
time
he
comes
out
he
will
be
frightened
away
otters
often
land
on
the
logs
which
project
into
the
water
when
you
can
find
such
a
log
cut
a
notch
for
a
trap
so
that
it
will
set
about
two
inches
deep
and
place
some
mud
in
the
notch
so
as
to
hide
the
fresh
cutting
some
very
successful
trappers
set
their
traps
in
this
way
and
place
some
good
scent
on
the
log
above
the
trap
if
you
can
find
an
otter
slide
find
the
place
where
the
animal
lands
on
the
bank
to
visit
the
slide
and
set
the
trap
under
about
two
inches
of
water
the
nos
and
newhouse
traps
were
designed
especially
for
trapping
otters
on
their
slides
the
trap
should
be
set
at
the
foot
of
the
slide
so
as
to
catch
the
animal
by
the
breast
or
body
otters
often
travel
in
pairs
and
it
is
usually
advisable
to
set
two
or
three
traps
on
one
stream
do
not
make
your
camp
near
the
stream
and
do
not
travel
along
the
stream
more
than
necessary
in
looking
at
the
traps
do
not
go
too
close
unless
the
traps
need
your
attention
there
is
no
way
in
which
the
sea
otter
can
be
trapped
and
they
are
hunted
only
with
rifles
the
methods
employed
in
hunting
them
have
been
very
successful
and
as
a
consequence
the
animal
has
been
practically
exterminated
the
track
of
the
otter
is
peculiar
owing
to
their
strange
mode
of
travel
as
before
mentioned
their
method
of
travel
is
a
series
of
plunging
slides
and
in
the
snow
they
make
a
deep
furrow
their
footprints
being
from
four
to
eight
feet
apart
according
to
the
sliding
conditions
when
two
or
more
are
traveling
in
company
they
will
usually
all
run
in
the
same
trail
their
tracks
are
as
a
rule
only
seen
on
lakes
and
streams
but
occasionally
they
will
go
overland
from
one
stream
to
another
the
footprints
will
measure
about
one
and
or
one
and
inches
in
length
and
about
the
same
in
width

chapter
viii
the
beaver
when
this
country
was
first
explored
and
settled
beavers
were
found
in
good
numbers
throughout
the
united
states
and
canada
but
at
present
they
are
extinct
in
many
of
the
states
where
they
were
once
abundant
today
they
are
found
in
fair
numbers
throughout
the
greater
part
of
canada
and
alaska
also
in
a
few
of
the
northern
and
western
states
there
are
also
a
few
beavers
found
in
the
south
at
the
present
time
however
many
of
the
states
as
well
as
some
of
the
provinces
of
canada
have
made
laws
prohibiting
the
trapping
or
killing
of
beavers
to
prevent
them
from
being
exterminated
the
beaver
is
an
amphibious
animal
resembling
the
muskrat
in
appearance
but
much
larger
it
has
the
same
thick
heavy
body
short
neck
and
scaly
tail
the
hind
feet
are
large
and
strong
and
the
toes
are
connected
by
a
web
the
front
feet
are
small
the
tail
is
paddle
shaped
four
or
five
inches
wide
and
about
ten
inches
long
when
full
grown
the
beaver
will
weigh
from
forty
to
fifty
pounds
although
occasionally
a
much
larger
one
is
found
the
under
fur
is
very
fine
and
soft
and
is
mixed
with
longer
and
coarser
hairs
called
guard
hairs
the
prevailing
color
is
a
rich
reddish
brown
on
the
back
and
sides
and
ashy
beneath
the
food
of
the
beaver
consists
mostly
of
bark
of
such
woods
as
poplar
birch
willow
and
cottonwood
as
well
as
the
roots
of
the
water
lily
in
the
south
they
also
eat
corn
beavers
build
houses
of
sticks
stones
and
mud
similar
in
shape
to
the
houses
of
the
muskrat
locating
usually
in
the
edge
of
a
pond
or
lake
but
often
making
a
large
pond
to
suit
their
requirements
by
building
a
dam
across
the
stream
even
when
their
houses
are
built
on
a
lake
or
pond
they
always
build
a
dam
across
the
outlet
so
as
to
raise
the
water
two
or
three
feet
the
dams
are
built
of
the
same
material
as
the
houses
sometimes
there
are
one
or
two
small
dams
found
below
the
main
dam
and
they
are
so
well
made
that
they
will
last
for
many
years
and
are
so
tight
that
the
water
usually
drips
evenly
over
the
top
the
houses
are
also
very
well
made
the
walls
being
several
feet
in
thickness
there
are
usually
two
entrances
both
under
water
the
size
and
general
shape
of
the
house
depends
on
the
number
of
beavers
inhabiting
it
the
house
of
a
full
family
of
beavers
will
usually
measure
about
twelve
feet
in
diameter
at
the
water
line
but
will
some
times
be
even
larger
and
the
height
is
about
six
or
seven
feet
when
there
are
only
two
or
three
beavers
the
house
is
much
smaller
and
more
pointed
on
the
top
a
full
family
consists
of
from
six
to
eight
members
there
are
usually
two
old
beavers
two
or
three
two
year
olds
and
two
or
three
young
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
young
beavers
remain
two
years
with
the
parents
and
as
it
requires
several
years
for
them
to
grow
their
full
size
there
are
always
three
sizes
in
a
family
when
they
have
reached
the
age
of
two
years
they
start
out
and
make
a
house
of
their
own
the
beavers
born
the
spring
before
becoming
the
medium
size
and
a
new
litter
taking
their
place
by
autumn
the
beavers
that
have
left
the
main
family
have
their
house
and
dam
completed
and
a
store
of
food
laid
up
for
winter
many
of
the
beavers
travel
about
through
the
summer
following
the
streams
and
return
to
their
homes
early
in
the
fall
sometimes
if
they
are
late
in
getting
back
they
will
have
to
work
day
and
night
in
order
to
get
sufficient
food
gathered
for
winter
before
the
ice
comes
this
food
consists
of
saplings
and
small
trees
which
they
gnaw
off
about
a
foot
above
the
ground
drag
into
the
edge
of
the
water
where
they
are
cut
up
into
pieces
of
different
lengths
stored
away
under
water
in
front
of
the
house
just
how
they
cause
this
wood
to
sink
remain
in
place
under
the
water
is
a
mystery
the
beaver
spends
the
entire
winter
under
the
ice
when
he
feels
hungry
he
goes
out
and
gets
a
piece
of
wood
takes
it
into
the
house
eats
the
bark
and
takes
the
peeled
stick
out
again
they
repair
the
house
and
dam
each
fall
and
they
also
make
holes
in
the
bank
under
water
to
which
they
can
retreat
in
case
the
house
is
disturbed
or
when
they
hear
a
noise
on
the
ice
trappers
who
are
well
acquainted
with
the
habits
of
the
beaver
can
make
a
fair
estimate
of
the
number
of
inmates
of
a
house
it
sometimes
happens
that
a
pair
of
young
beavers
or
a
lone
beaver
that
has
escaped
from
some
family
which
has
been
trapped
will
locate
in
an
old
deserted
house
and
then
it
is
not
such
an
easy
matter
the
experienced
trapper
however
is
not
likely
to
be
fooled
he
goes
along
the
shore
and
carefully
examines
the
stumps
where
the
animals
have
been
cutting
trees
for
food
the
amount
of
stuff
that
has
been
cut
will
show
usually
but
he
has
still
a
better
way
of
determining
whether
the
work
was
done
by
one
or
more
beavers
he
examines
the
teeth
marks
on
the
stumps
and
if
they
are
all
alike
he
decides
that
there
is
not
a
full
family
but
only
two
or
perhaps
only
one
a
lone
beaver
that
has
escaped
from
the
trapper
is
difficult
to
trap
i
remember
once
finding
such
a
one
located
on
a
large
pool
of
a
fair
sized
stream
he
had
no
dam
and
had
only
a
small
house
along
the
bank
i
found
him
in
the
fall
while
the
water
was
still
open
and
he
was
busy
laying
in
a
supply
of
food
for
winter
well
i
went
there
one
rainy
day
and
set
two
traps
i
set
the
traps
very
carefully
fastening
to
sliding
poles
which
i
had
cut
quite
a
distance
away
so
as
not
to
make
any
noise
near
the
house
the
rain
washed
the
scent
away
in
a
short
time
and
i
could
see
no
reason
why
he
should
take
alarm
but
he
did
just
the
same
i
kept
those
traps
set
a
week
but
did
not
catch
him
nor
did
i
ever
see
any
fresh
signs
there
after
i
had
set
the
traps
apparently
he
had
left
the
place
immediately
after
i
had
set
the
traps
an
indian
trapper
had
trapped
several
families
of
beavers
near
there
the
season
before
and
this
beaver
was
one
that
had
given
him
the
slip
in
cutting
timber
the
beaver
takes
the
wood
in
small
chips
gnawing
all
around
the
tree
until
it
falls
he
knows
absolutely
nothing
about
throwing
the
tree
in
the
direction
in
which
he
wishes
it
to
fall
but
lets
it
fall
just
as
it
is
inclined
to
go
i
have
seen
where
a
tree
had
lodged
refusing
to
fall
and
the
beaver
had
stood
up
and
cut
several
pieces
off
the
butt
and
as
the
tree
still
refused
to
fall
he
had
let
it
remain
hanging
it
was
a
case
of
hard
work
and
no
pay
when
one
finds
a
family
of
beavers
and
expects
to
trap
the
same
ground
each
season
he
should
not
attempt
to
catch
them
all
as
by
leaving
a
few
to
breed
he
is
sure
of
getting
beavers
each
season
the
indians
in
such
cases
trap
the
old
beavers
only
which
they
do
by
setting
the
traps
a
good
distance
from
the
house
for
the
young
beavers
never
venture
far
away
many
beavers
are
trapped
in
the
fall
just
before
the
ice
forms
but
their
fur
is
not
prime
until
in
the
north
they
remain
in
good
condition
until
the
first
of
june
in
the
south
they
would
probably
not
be
good
after
the
middle
of
april
beaver
castors
have
a
market
value
usually
selling
for
seven
or
eight
dollars
a
pound
in
preparing
them
they
should
be
dried
slowly
in
a
shady
place
most
trappers
prefer
to
keep
the
castors
for
scent
as
it
is
attractive
to
many
animals
the
indians
sometimes
combine
the
two
scents
by
making
a
hole
in
the
beaver
castors
and
squeezing
the
contents
of
the
oil
castors
into
them
the
castors
are
then
hung
up
and
allowed
to
dry
this
is
more
or
less
attractive
to
all
animals
only

small
piece
being
used
in

with

sliding

the
following
methods
of
trapping
are
for
use
in
open
water
in
either
the
fall
or
spring
the
first
method
given
is
usually
considered
best
find
a
place
where
the
bank
bluffs
a
little
and
the
water
is
of
good
depth
make
a
little
pocket
in
the
bank
several
inches
deep
and
set
the
trap
in
the
water
directly
in
front
of
this
pocket
where
the
pan
of
the
trap
will
be
about
two
inches
under
water
take
a
piece
of
beaver
castor
and
fasten
it
to
the
bank
with
a
stick
about
fourteen
inches
above
the
water
and
as
far
back
in
the
pocket
as
possible
if
you
are
using
some
other
scent
instead
of
beaver
castor
just
dip
a
small
stick
in
the
scent
and
fasten
it
to
the
bank
fasten
the
trap
so
that
the
beaver
will
drown
the
sliding
pole
is
best
be
sure
to
use
a
dead
pole
or
stake
as
if
a
green
pole
is
used
the
other
beavers
may
carry
it
away
trap
and
all
this
is
a
very
good
method
for
spring
and
fall
or
at
any
time
when
there
is
open
water
here
is
another
method
for
the
same
kind
of
place
set
the
trap
under
water
at
the
foot
of
a
steep
bank
and
fasten
a
couple
of
green
poplar
or
cottonwood
sticks
on
the
bank
directly
over
the
trap
so
that
the
beaver
will
step
into
the
trap
in
trying
to
reach
them
have
the
fresh
cut
ends
of
the
sticks
showing
plainly
and
make
your
set
near
the
house
or
dam
so
that
the
beavers
are
sure
to
see
it
fasten
trap
so
that
the
captured
animal
will
be
sure
to
drown
no
covering
is
needed
on
traps
when
they
are
set
under
water
look
for
the
beaver
slides
or
trails
where
he
drags
his
food
into
the
water
and
if
the
water
is
deep
enough
to
drown
him
set
the
trap
under
about
two
inches
of
water
just
where
he
lands
on
the
bank
this
set
is
all
right
in
the
fall
when
the
beaver
is
laying
in
his
food
for
the
winter
but
is
not
much
good
in
the
spring
some
trappers
set
the
trap
a
foot
or
more
from
the
shore
where
the
water
is
about
six
inches
deep
as
by
so
doing
the
beaver
is
caught
by
the
hind
foot
and
is
not
so
likely
to
escape
when
using
a
set
of
this
kind
it
is
best
to
use
a
number
or
trap
as
the
no
is
too
small
for
the
beaver
hind
foot
beavers
usually
have
a
slide
or
trail
over
the
center
of
the
dam
and
this
makes
a
very
good
place
to
set
a
trap
set
the
trap
under
water
on
the
upper
side
of
the
dam
just
where
the
trail
leads
over
be
sure
to
fasten
the
trap
so
that
the
animal
will
drown
as
if
it
is
not
drowned
it
is
almost
certain
to
escape
and
even
if
it
does
not
the
others
will
be
frightened
and
you
will
have
a
hard
time
to
get
them
in
the
spring
after
the
ice
has
gone
it
is
a
good
plan
to
set
a
few
traps
along
the
stream
baiting
with
beaver
castor
as
the
beavers
are
traveling
at
this
time
and
you
are
likely
to
catch
one
almost
anywhere
along
the
streams
when
setting
traps
in
this
way
it
is
best
to
drench
the
set
with
water
to
remove
the
human
scent
the
beaver
is
seldom
afraid
of
human
scent
but
there
is
likely
to
be
an
otter
along
that
way
and
you
stand
a
good
chance
of
catching
him
in
a
trap
baited
with
beaver
castor
beavers
may
be
caught
in
and
early
spring
by
setting
baited
traps
under
the
ice
it
is
not
much
use
to
set
traps
under
the
ice
in
early
winter
as
the
beaver
food
is
still
in
good
condition
and
they
will
not
take
bait
well
moreover
you
are
likely
to
frighten
them
and
make
them
harder
to
trap
later
on
the
following
methods
are
among
the
best
for
use
under
the
ice
the
one
first
given
being
most
used
and
is
probably
the
best
go
close
to
the
beaver
house
where
the
ice
is
thin
and
by
cutting
small
holes
in
the
ice
find
a
place
where
the
water
is
about
twelve
inches
deep
having
found
such
a
place
enlarge
the
hole
until
it
is
about
sixteen
by
twenty
inches
in
size
making
a
pen
the
same
size
as
the
hole
by
shoving
down
dead
sticks
about
four
inches
apart
if
the
bottom
is
very
hard
you
will
have
to
freeze
the
sticks
to
the
ice
to
hold
them
in
place
this
may
be
done
by
throwing
snow
in
the
water
and
packing
it
around
the
sticks
and
against
the
edge
of
the
ice
when
the
pen
is
completed
cut
a
piece
of
green
poplar
about
or
inches
thick
and
two
or
three
feet
long
and
fasten
it
to
a
stake
by
one
end
the
poplar
being
placed
at
a
right
angle
to
the
stake
this
green
poplar
is
for
bait
and
the
stake
should
be
driven
down
in
one
corner
of
the
pen
so
that
the
bait
is
within
two
or
three
inches
from
the
bottom
and
close
along
one
side
of
the
pen
extending
a
foot
or
more
beyond
the
entrance
illustration
beaver
trap
set
under
ice
the
trap
should
be
staked
and
set
well
inside
of
the
pen
and
quite
close
to
the
bait
so
that
the
jaw
of
the
trap
will
just
clear
the
bait
this
set
will
be
readily
understood
by
referring
to
the
cut
if
the
bottom
is
of
thin
mud
as
is
often
the
case
you
will
have
to
make
a
bed
for
the
trap
by
sinking
a
bunch
of
evergreen
boughs
inside
of
the
pen
it
is
also
best
to
fasten
the
bait
near
the
entrance
to
prevent
the
beaver
from
swinging
it
around
when
the
set
is
completed
cover
the
hole
with
evergreen
boughs
bank
it
with
snow
to
keep
it
from
freezing
it
is
best
to
let
this
set
go
for
about
a
week
before
looking
at
it
the
beavers
will
be
frightened
and
will
not
approach
the
set
for
a
few
days
but
finally
one
of
them
musters
up
courage
enough
to
try
to
pull
the
bait
out
of
the
pen
when
he
finds
it
fast
he
cuts
it
off
at
the
entrance
of
the
pen
takes
it
to
the
house
to
eat
it
this
sharpens
his
appetite
makes
him
more
courageous
and
he
finally
ventures
into
the
pen
for
the
balance
of
the
bait
in
attempting
to
cut
the
bait
he
places
one
front
foot
on
the
bait
and
the
other
one
in
the
trap
when
using
this
set
you
should
use
three
or
four
sets
at
each
house
another
good
ice
method
is
as
follows
find
the
proper
depth
of
water
about
fourteen
inches
and
make
a
pen
of
dead
sticks
arranging
them
in
the
form
of
a
now
take
some
green
poplar
and
shove
them
down
firmly
into
the
bottom
about
six
inches
apart
close
up
to
the
stakes
on
the
inside
of
the
pen
these
bait
sticks
must
be
long
enough
to
reach
above
the
ice
so
that
they
will
freeze
fast
at
the
top
stake
the
trap
and
set
it
in
the
center
of
the
enclosure
with
the
pan
about
nine
inches
from
the
center
bait
throw
some
snow
in
the
hole
so
that
it
will
freeze
and
hold
the
bait
sticks
securely
the
following
method
is
one
of
the
best
for
use
in
deep
water
cut
a
dead
pole
about
four
inches
in
diameter
and
six
or
seven
feet
long
flatten
the
pole
at
one
end
and
loop
the
trap
chain
around
the
pole
then
set
the
trap
on
the
end
of
the
pole
and
tie
it
with
a
string
to
hold
it
in
place
now
cut
an
oblong
hole
in
the
ice
and
place
the
pole
in
the
water
in
an
inclined
position
so
that
the
trap
is
about
twelve
inches
below
the
ice
pack
wet
snow
around
the
pole
to
hold
it
in

fasten
two
sticks
of
green
poplar
in
the
ice
over
the
trap
one
on
either
side
in
attempting
to
cut
the
bait
the
beaver
will
put
his
foot
in
the
trap
always
fasten
your
trap
to
a
dead
stick
or
pole
for
if
a
green
stake
is
used
the
beavers
are
likely
to
carry
it
away
trap
and
all
poplar
and
cottonwood
make
the
best
baits
but
in
case
they
can
not
be
obtained
use
birch
willow
or
black
cherry
when
setting
traps
near
the
house
in
open
water
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
and
do
not
remain
in
the
vicinity
longer
than
necessary
when
trapping
in
open
water
never
camp
or
make
a
fire
near
the
pond
where
the
beavers
are
located
in
winter
after
the
ice
has
formed
it
does
not
matter
if
you
find
a
beaver
house
in
winter
when
the
snow
is
deep
and
wish
to
know
if
it
is
inhabited
examine
the
house
and
if
the
snow
is
melted
on
the
top
you
may
be
sure
there
are
beavers
in
it
another
way
to
tell
whether
a
house
is
inhabited
is
to
cut
a
hole
through
the
ice
and
shove
down
a
piece
of
green
poplar
filling
the
hole
with
snow
examine
it
in
about
a
week
and
if
the
poplar
has
been
cut
you
may
be
sure
you
have
found
beavers
the
track
of
the
beaver
is
seldom
seen
as
they
do
not
move
about
much
in
winter
and
on
their
trails
their
tracks
are
obliterated
by
the
food
which
they
drag
into
the
water
the
trapper
does
not
look
for
tracks
but
for
more
conspicuous
signs
such
as
houses
and
dams

fresh
cut
wood

the
muskrat
chapter
ix
the
muskrat
the
muskrat
is
a
small
herbivorous
animal
of
the
amphibious
class
its
head
and
body
are
from
thirteen
to
fifteen
inches
in
length
the
tail
is
nine
or
ten
inches
two
edged
and
for
its
length
is
rudder
shaped
and
covered
with
scales
and
thin
short
hair
the
front
feet
are
small
the
hind
feet
large
and
slightly
webbed
making
the
animal
an
expert
swimmer
the
color
of
the
fur
is
brown
above
and
ashy
beneath
the
muskrat
is
a
nocturnal
animal
but
is
sometimes
seen
in
the
day
time
their
food
consists
of
grass
and
roots
fruit
grain
and
vegetables
they
will
also
eat
clams
sometimes
when
food
is
scarce
they
thrive
best
in
sluggish
streams
and
ponds
bordered
with
grass
and
flags
the
roots
of
which
are
their
chief
support
and
from
the
tops
of
which
they
construct
their
houses
these
structures
are
dome
shaped
and
rise
sometimes
to
a
height
of
five
feet
from
the
water
the
entrances
are
at
the
bottom
under
water
so
that
the
inside
of
the
house
is
not
exposed
to
the
open
air
from
six
to
ten
muskrats
are
sometimes
found
in
one
house
hundreds
of
these
dwellings
can
be
counted
from
a
single
point
in
many
large
marshes
the
muskrats
found
on
the
streams
do
not
build
houses
but
live
in
holes
in
the
bank
the
entrances
of
which
are
under
water
the
muskrat
is
found
throughout
the
greater
part
of
the
united
states
and
canada
they
are
especially
numerous
in
the
marshes
on
the
coast
of
delaware
and
maryland
this
muskrat
ground
is
owned
by
private
parties
who
lease
the
ground
to
the
trappers
for
a
certain
length
of
time
the
trapper
catching
all
the
animals
he
can
in
that
length
of
time
muskrats
are
also
very
plentiful
in
some
parts
of
western
canada
these
animals
are
very
prolific
bringing
forth
from
six
to
nine
at
a
birth
and
three
litters
in
a
season
they
have
many
enemies
such
as
the
fox

and
owl
but
their
greatest
enemy
is
man
muskrats
are
trapped
in
the
fall
winter
and
spring
but
they
are
not
prime
until
and
some
are
not
fully
prime
until
the
first
of
march
nevertheless
they
are
more
easily
caught
in
the
fall
and
as
the
skins
bring
a
fair
price
the
most
trapping
is
done
at
this
time
that
is
for
bank
rats
those
living
in
holes
in
the
banks
where
the
muskrats
live
in
houses
they
are
trapped
mostly
after
the
ice
had
formed
in
the
far
north
the
skins
are
in
good
condition
until
the
first
of
june
while
in
the
extreme
south
they
should
not
be
trapped
after
the
first
of
april
the
muskrats
found
in
settled
districts
are
larger
and
better
furred
than
those
of
the
wilderness
also
those
found
east
of
the
mississippi
river
are
larger
than
those
of
the
west
when
trapping
for
these
animals
the
traps
should
always
be
staked
full
length
of
chain
into
deep
water
so
that
the
captured
animal
will
drown
as
otherwise
they
are
almost
certain
to
twist
off
the
foot
and
escape
unless
they
are
caught
by
a
hind
foot
many
trappers
set
their
traps
several
inches
under
water
as
by
so
doing
they
catch
the
rat
by
a
hind
foot
and
there
is
very
little
danger
of
them
escaping
some
stake
their
traps
the
length
of
the
chain
into
deep
water
and
drive
another
stake
about
a
foot
beyond
the
muskrat
when
caught
winds
the
chain
around
the
outer
stake
and
is
thus
prevented
from
reaching
the
bank
others
prefer
to
tie
a
stone
on
the
end
of
the
chain
and
lay
the
stone
in
deep
water
the
traps
most
used
are
the
nos
and
but
the
no
is
also
used
sometimes
the
victor
trap
is
a
great
favorite
as
it
does
not
have
a
strong
a
spring
as
the
higher
priced
traps
and
is
not
so
likely
to
break
the
animal
leg
the
single

oneida
jump
traps
are
also
fine
traps
for
muskrats
one
of
the
most
common
methods
of
trapping
the
muskrat
is
to
find
their
slides
on
the
bank
and
set
the
trap
at
the
foot
of
the
slide
under
about
two
and
a
half
or
three
inches
of
water
no
covering
is
needed
if
you
can
find
a
log
with
one
end
lying
in
the
water
examine
same
and
if
there
are
muskrat
droppings
on
the
log
cut
a
notch
for
the
trap
so
that
it
will
be
just
under
water
when
set
in
the
notch
the
chain
may
be
stapled
to
the
log
another
good
way
is
to
find
their
holes
in
the
bank
and
set
a
trap
in
the
entrance
staking
into
deep
water
if
the
water
is
still
and
there
is
much
grass
in

water
look
around

you
will
find
their
feeding
beds

of
grass
which
appear
to
be
floating

there
are
muskrats
about

be
stapled
to

anchor
it
in

the
muskrats
are
sure
to
find
it
to
trap
muskrats

their
houses
in
winter
cut
a
hole
in
the
side

best
success
at

kind
of
trapping
by
using

no
and
a
good

red
and
gray
species
the
black
silver
and
cross
foxes
are
supposed
to
be
only
color
varieties
of
the
red
but
why
this
occurs
and
only
in
the
north
is
a
mystery
the
silver
or
black
fox
is
the
most
beautiful
and
most
valuable
of
all
the
foxes
it
is
found
in
the
high
northern
latitudes
of
both
continents
in
this
country
it
is
found
as
far
south
as
the
northern
tier
of
states
they
are
most
abundant
in
the
interior
of
alaska
the
northwest
territories
ontario
northern
quebec
labrador
and
newfoundland
at
the
london
fur
sales
specimens
have
been
sold
at
over
one
thousand
dollars
each
but
the
average
price
is
probably
about
two
hundred
dollars
wherever
the
silver
fox
is
found
the
cross
or
patch
fox
is
found
also
and
they
also
range
somewhat
farther
south
they
are
always
found
in
greater
numbers
than
the
silver
variety
the
red
fox
is
the
most
common
and
is
distributed
over
a
larger
territory
than
the
other
varieties
they
range
from
the
northern
timber
line
to
well
down
in
the
southern
states
they
are
probably
most
abundant
in
the
eastern
provinces
of
canada
and
the
england
states
but
they
are
found
in
fair
numbers
in
parts
of
new
york
pennsylvania
west
virginia
tennessee
arkansas
missouri
michigan
and
the
larger
part
of
canada
and
alaska
the
gray
fox
is
one
of
the
least
valuable
and
is
most
abundant
in
the
southern
states
in
the
east
they
range
as
far
north
as
connecticut
in
some
places
they
have
supplanted
the
red
species
and
in
other
places
the
grays
have
disappeared
and
the
reds
have
taken
their
place
the
fox
as
well
as
the
wolf
and
coyote
belongs
to
the
dog
family
which
is
second
only
to
man
in
intelligence
the
different
species
are
all
practically
the
same
size
but
the
same
varieties
vary
in
size
in
different
localities
the
average
weight
is
from
nine
to
ten
pounds
in
general
appearance
they
somewhat
resemble
the
dog
being
rather
light
of
build
considering
their
height
the
ears
are
erect
and
pointed
the
tail
thick
and
bushy
and
the
muzzle
small
and
pointed
the
fur
varies
in
the
different
species
being
coarse
and
rather
short
on
the
gray
while
that
of
the
silver
fox
is
extremely
fine
and
soft
the
mating
season
comes
in
february
and
e
young
are
born
usually
in
april
there
being
from
four
to
nine
in
a
litter
they
make
dens
in
the
sand
hills
and
in
rocky
districts
den
in
the
rocks
except
during
the
breeding
season
they
spend
very
little
time
in
the
dens
but
lie
during
the
day
in
some
clump
of
brush
or
weeds
or
often
on
top
of
a
stump
or
log
in
mountainous
sections
they
lie
during
the
day
somewhere
on
the
mountain
side
and
come
down
into
the
valleys
at
night
in
search
of
food
the
fox
is
not
strictly
a
carnivorous
animal
when
food
is
scarce
they
often
feed
on
apples
and
other
fruits
but
their
regular
food
is
flesh
they
are
fond
of
partridge
rabbits
mice
skunk
muskrat
or
opossum
flesh
carrion
of
almost
all
kinds
fish
eggs
poultry
and
often
they
come
around
the
camps
and
gather
up
the
scraps
bread
bacon
rinds
etc
if
they
are
given
time
and
not
disturbed
they
become
quite
bold
in
coming
to
such
places
for
food
and
the
trappers
sometime
take
advantage
of
this
peculiarity
by
baiting
them
awhile
before
setting
the
trap
the
fox
in
the
north
becomes
prime
in
the
beginning
of
november
and
remains
in
good
condition
until
the
middle
of
march
when
the
fur
begins
to
take
on
a
rubbed
and
woolly
appearance
in
the
south
they
do
not
become
prime
until
the
last
of
november
or
the
beginning
of
december
and
go
out
of
prime
in
february
most
of
the
foxes
are
trapped
in
the
fall
before
the
ground
freezes
too
hard
for
dry
sets
and
of
course
many
of
them
are
not
prime
the
traps
recommended
for
the
fox
for
dry
land
use
are
the
nos
and
oneida
jump
and
blake
lamb
the
newhouse
and
hawley
norton
and
the
no
victor
for
water
and
snow
trapping
the
nos
and
oneida
jump
and
blake
lamb
and
the
and
newhouse
will
be
found
most
desirable
in
places
where
there
are
springs
and
small
streams
there
is
no
better
method
than
the
old
water
set
which
is
made
as
follows
it
is
best
to
find
a
spring
which
does
not
freeze
but
for
early
fall
trapping
a
brook
will
do
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
water
in
small
streams
sometimes
makes
trouble
and
a
spring
or
small
pond
gives
best
results
the
spring
should
be
at
least
four
feet
in
diameter
and
should
be
prepared
for
the
set
in
the
summer
but
if
care
is
used
may
be
fixed
up
during
the
trapping
season
a
moss
covered
stone
or
a
sod
according
to
surroundings
should
be
placed
about
a
foot
and
a
half
from
shore
and
should
rise
about
two
or
three
inches
above
the
water
this
is
the
bait
sod
the
trap
is
set
half
way
between
the
sod
and
the
shore
and
the

and
chain
should
be
covered
with
mud
or
whatever
is
found
in
the
bottom
of
the
spring
illustration
water
set
for
fox
the
pan
of
the
trap
should
just
be
covered
with
water
now
take
a
nice
piece
of
moss
or
sod
and
place
it
on
the
pan
of
the
trap
so
that
it
will
rise
an
inch
above
the
water
when
properly
placed
this
sod
will
look
natural
and
will
apparently
be
a
safe
stepping
place
for
the
fox
the
pan
should
be
so
adjusted
that
it
will
not
spring
too
easily
a
small
piece
of
bait
and
also
some
scent
should
be
placed
on
the
larger
sod
in
making
this
set
you
should
wade
up
the
outlet
of
the
spring
and
stand
in
the
water
while
making
the
set
do
not
touch
the
bank
or
any
of
the
surroundings
the
trap
should
be
fitted
with
a
chain
about
three
feet
in
length
with
a
two
prong
drag
attached
but
most
trappers
simply
wire
a
stone
of
eight
or
ten
pounds
weight
to
the
end
of
the
chain
the
drag
whatever
is
used
should
be
buried
in
the
bed
of
the
spring
i
recommend
the
flesh
of
the
muskrat
skunk
opossum
or
for
bait
and
it
should
be
allowed
to
taint
by
remaining
about
a
week
in
a
glass
jar
this
method
was
first
used
by
william
schofield
a
famous
fox
trapper
of
the
eastern
states
two
men
have
been
known
to
catch
over
one
hundred
foxes
in
a
season
with
this
method
besides
considerable
other
furs
taken
in
the
same
traps
for
the
method
is
good
for
many
other
animals
besides
the
fox
one
trapper
recommends
setting
the
trap
in
exactly
the
same
manner
except
that
the
bait
sod
is
omitted
and
the
bait
a
bird
is
fastened
by
means
of
a
stick
thrust
in
the
bottom
of
the
spring
the
stick
must
be
entirely
out
of
sight
and
the
bird
apparently
floating
in
the
water
both
of
these
methods
are
very
good
and
are
especially
recommended
for
the
novice
as
they
are
the
easiest
and
surest
methods
to
start
on
the
water
sets
given
above
can
of
course
only
be
used
in
certain
places
for
in
some
of
the
best
fox
countries
springs
can
not
be
found
and
even
the
streams
are
not
suitable
for
trapping
for
this
reason
many
professional
fox
trappers
prefer
to
use
dry
land
sets
and
the
blind
set
will
be
found
to
be
one
of
the
very
best
look
for
fox
tracks
in
old
stock
trails
foot
paths
old
roads
in
the
woods
openings
under
fences
and
having
first
cleaned
the
traps
by
boiling
or
washing
find
a
narrow
place
in
the
trail
and
dig
out
a
nest
for
the
trap
make
this
nest
so
that
when
the
trap
is
set
in
it
the
jaws
will
lie
lengthwise
of
the
trail
line
this
nest
with
dry
grass
or
leaves
and
having
attached
the
trap
to
some
sort
of
a
drag
set
it
and
place
it
in
the
place
prepared
fill
in
all
around
the
outside
of
the
jaws
with
dry
dirt
and
cover
the
springs
now
lay
a
piece
of
clean
paper
over
the
trap
and
cover
all
with
about
inch
of
dirt
making
it
look
like
the
other
parts
of
the
trail
as
much
as
possible
the
chain
and
drag
must
be
carefully
concealed
it
is
best
to
have
a
basket
or
piece
of
canvas
in
which
to
place
the
dirt
while
making
the
set
and
to
carry
away
what
is
not
needed
do
not
spit
near
the
trap
and
do
not
leave
any
signs
of
your
presence
it
is
not
necessary
to
wear
gloves
but
the
hands
should
be
kept
clean
this
is
an
excellent
method
especially
for
the
old
sly
animals

dry

the
professional
trappers
of
the
east
use
the
bait
method
mostly
and
although
the
different
trappers
use
different
baits
and
scents
the
methods
of
setting
the
traps
are
all
practically
the
same
the
following
directions
are
almost
the
same
as
you
will
get
when
you
buy
a
method
at
from
to
or
more
prepare
your
bait
about
a
week
before
you
want
to
set
the
traps
by
cutting
into
pieces
about
half
the
size
of
an
egg
and
placing
in
a
clean
jar
to
become
tainted
put
a
little
bit
of
scent
on
each
bait
before
placing
in
jar
there
are
different
ways
for
preparing
the
traps
most
trappers
prefer
to
boil
them
in
hemlock
boughs
or
lay
them
over
night
in
running
water
wear
clean
gloves
when
handling
the
traps
and
carry
them
in
a
clean
basket
now
find
an
old
stump
or
a
rock
along
some
hillside
and
dig
a
hole
under
it
making
the
hole
four
or
five
inches
in
diameter
and
ten
or
twelve
inches
deep
stake
the
trap
solid
driving
stake
out
of
sight
and
set
the
trap
about
ten
inches
in
front
of
the
hole
cover
the
trap
first
with
a
piece
of
clean
paper
and
finish
by
about
inch
of
dirt
dug
out
of
the
hole
it
should
look
as
if
some
animal
had
dug
the
hole
and
scratched
the
dirt
out
in
front
use
a
small
shovel
made
for
the
purpose
or
a
sharpened
stick
to
dig
the
hole
and
keep
your
gloves
on
all
the
time
do
not
walk
around
but
stand
in
the
same
spot
until
the
set
is
complete
now
put
a
piece
of
bait
in
the
back
of
the
hole
using
a
sharpened
stick
to
handle
the
bait
and
put
just
a
little
scent
by
the
side
of
the
hole
when
you
catch
a
fox
kill
him
without
drawing
blood
and
set
the
trap
back
in
the
same
place
your
chances
for
catching
another
fox
are
doubled
skunks
coons
and
other
animals
will
also
be
caught
in
these
sets
the
following
method
is
a
good
one
to
use
in
settled
countries
as
it
is
not
so
likely
to
catch
dogs
and
other
animals
as
other
methods
are
find
an
a
small
pointed
knoll
an
old
rotten
stump
a

covered
rock
or
an
old
log
with
one
end
off
the
ground
set
the
trap
on
the
highest
point
covering
carefully
so
that
it
looks
just
like
it
did
before
the
trap
was
set
place
a
fair
sized
bait
such
as
a
skunk
or
muskrat
about
eight
feet
away
from
the
trap
the
fox
is
always
suspicious
of
a
bait
especially
a
large
one
and
will
always
get
on
the
highest
point
to
look
at
it
before
going
close
of
course
there
must
be
no
other
place
for
him
to
get
up
on
near
the
bait
in
the
winter
traps
may
be
set
on
muskrat
houses
and
bait
placed
on
the
ice
i
think
it
best
to
set
the
traps
several
days
before
placing
the
baits
as
in
that
way
the
human
and
other
scents
have
a
chance
to
pass
away
when
baiting
go
just
close
enough
to
throw
the
bait
into
place
some
trappers
set
traps
around
large
baits
such
as
the
carcass
of
a
horse
cow
or
sheep
but
i
think
it
best
to
place
the
bait
by
the
side
of
a
trail
and
set
several
traps
on
the
trail
from
thirty
to
seventy
five
yards
from
the
bait
when
feeding
on
the
bait
the
foxes
will
travel
on
the
trail
and
they
will
not
be
looking
for
danger
so
far
away
from
the
bait
comparatively
few
of
the
professional
fox
trappers
can
trap
the
fox
successfully
after
the
deep
snow
come
on
but
the
following
methods
are
the
best
known
and
will
catch
the
fox
if
you
use
care
in
setting
of
course
snow
sets
of
any
kind
can
only
be
used
when
the
snow
is
dry
and
loose
and
likely
to
remain
in
that
condition
for
some
time
the
first
method
given
is
the
one
used
by
the
canadian
indians
for
taking
the
silver
fox
in
the
great
northern
wilderness
out
on
the
ice
on
some
frozen
lake
or
on
any
open
wind
swept
piece
of
ground
make
a
mound
of
snow
beating
it
solid
so
that
it
will
not
drift
away
the
trap
should
be
fastened
to
a
clog
and
the
clog
buried
in
the
mound
make
the
mound
about
two
feet
high
and
make
a
hollow
in
the
top
for
the
trap
to
set
in
the
hollow
should
be
lined
with
down
or
some
other
dry
material
and
the
trap
set
in
the
hollow
and
covered
first
with
a
sheet
of
white
note
paper
finishing
with
a
half
inch
or
more
of
loose
snow
do
not
handle
this
snow
with
your
hands
for
if
you
do
it
will
be
certain
to
freeze
on
the
trap
the
best
way
is
to
take
a
bunch
of
evergreen
boughs
and
brush
the
snow
up
over
the
mound
so
that
it
sifts
lightly
over
the
trap
the
covering
on
the
trap
should
be
a
little
lower
than
the
top
of
the
mound
so
that
the
wind
will
not
uncover
the
trap
the
bait
is
cut
into
small
pieces
and
stuck
into
the
sides
of
the
mound
after
the
trap
is
set
it
will
only
require
a
short
time
for
the
wind
to
drift
your
tracks
shut
and
remove
all
traces
of
human
presence
and
the
trap
will
remain
in
working
order
as
long
as
the
cold
weather
lasts
if
water
rises
on
the
ice
it
will
not
reach
your
trap
and
if
there
is
a
snow
storm
the
first
wind
will
blow
the
loose
snow
off
the
mound
leaving
just
a
little
over
the
trap
when
looking
at
the
traps
you
should
not
go
nearer
than
fifty
yards
and
do
not
turn
off
your
route
but
walk
straight
by
this
is
a
splendid
method
for
use
in
the
far
north
where
the
snow
never
melts
or
freezes
during
the
winter
months
for
use
in
the
settled
countries
i
have
been
very
successful
with
this
method
find
where
foxes
travel
on
old
wood
roads
and
with
your
traps
clean
and
with
drags
attached
go
and
break
a
trail
in
the
snow
by
walking
back
and
forth
on
the
road
and
set
the
traps
in
this
broken
trail
without
bait
the
traps
should
be
set
and
covered
as
in
the
other
method
and
the
chain
and
clog
pushed
under
the
snow
at
the
side
of
the
trail
do
not
let
it
appear
that
you
have
stopped
at
all
and
when
looking
at
the
traps
you
can
follow
the
trail
and
step
right
over
the
traps
in
settled
localities
the
fox
will
follow
the
trail
because
the
walking
is
better
but
in
the
wilderness
where
the
track
of
a
man
is
seldom
seen
they
not
only
refuse
to
follow
the
trail
but
often
will
not
even
cross
it
i
believe
that
scent
is
more
used
for
than
for
trapping
any
other
animal
some
of
the
best
trappers
however
do
not
use
any
scent
at
all
but
i
believe
that
if
the
right
kind
is
used
that
it
is
a
great
help
one
of
the
best
scents
known
for
dry
land
or
water
sets
is
prepared
as
follows
remove
the
fat
from
one
or
two
skunks
chop
it
fine
and
take
a
sufficient
quantity
to
almost
fill
an
ordinary
pickle
bottle
take
two
mice
cut
them
up
and
add
to
the
fat
and
let
the
bottle
stand
in
the
sun
until
the
mixture
is
thoroughly
decomposed
then
add
the
scent
of
two
skunks
and
five
or
six
muskrats
the
bottle
must
be
kept
covered
so
the
flies
will
not
blow
it
but
it
must
not
be
tightly
corked
different
trappers
have
different
ways
of
preparing
this
scent
but
i
think
this
way
is
the
best
another
very
good
one
is
made
by
allowing
the
flesh
of
a
muskrat
to
rot
in
a
bottle
and
adding
about
four
ounces
of
strained
honey
and
ounce
of
essence
of
musk
pure
fish
oil
is
attractive
to
the
fox
and
is
used
by
some
very
good
trappers
we
believe
that
one
of
the
most
successful
scents
especially
for
winter
use
is
made
by
taking
the
generative
organs
of
the
female
fox
when
in
heat
and
preserving
it
in
alcohol
the
urine
of
the
fox
is
also
good
but
in
using
these
two
scents
no
bait
should
be
used
the
brine
from
mackerel
or
other
fish
is
claimed
to
be
a
good
scent
for
foxes
but
if
there
are
any
porcupines
or
rabbits
about
it
will
make
plenty
of
trouble
as
the
salt
is
very
attractive
to
these
animals
when
making
or
when
setting
on
a
trail
some
distance
from
a
bait
do
not
stake
your
traps
but
fasten
to
a
drag
of
some
kind
a
brush
a
stone
or
a
grapple
by
so
doing
the
fox
will
not
spoil
the
trail
for
the
next
one
and
the
trap
may
be
set
back
in
the
same
place
for
a
bait
set
on
dry
land
the
trap
may
be
staked
to
advantage
for
if
one
fox
is
caught
and
rolls
around
over
the
ground
you
are
more
likely
to
catch
another
one
there
do
not
start
out
with
a
dozen
traps
and
expect
to
make
a
success
of
fox
trapping
you
should
have
all
the
traps
that
you
can
look
after
do
not
depend
on
one
method
of
setting
as
a
fox
will
sometimes
learn
your
method
but
some
other
method
even
if
it
is
not
so
good
may
fool
them
when
killing
foxes
in
traps
do
so
if
possible
without
drawing
blood
one
of
the
best
ways
is
by
piercing
the
heart
with
a
wire
dagger
another
good
way
is
by
breaking
the
neck
which
may
be
done
as
follows
strike
the
fox
a
light
blow
over
the
head
with
a
stick
just
hard
enough
to
slightly
stun
him
and
when
he
drops
down
place
your
left
hand
on
the
back
of
his
neck
pinning
him
to
the
ground
and
with
your
right
hand
pull
his
nose
backward
against
his
back
it
requires
some
practice
to
do
this
right
the
track
of
the
red
fox
resembles
that
of
a
small
dog
being
perhaps
a
trifle
narrower
the
length
of
step
is
about
twelve
or
fourteen
inches
and
the
foot
prints
of
an
average
sized
fox
will
measure
about
one
and
a
half
inches
in
length
the
track
of
the
gray
fox
is
rounder
and
more
like
that
of
a
cat
some
hunters
claim
that
they
can
distinguish
the
track
of
the
male
fox
from
that
of
the
female
the
footprints
of
the
female
being
smaller
and
a
trifle
narrower
in
proportion
there
is
no
difference
in
the
footprints
of
the

the
coyote
or
prairie
wolf
chapter
xi
the
wolf
the
wolf
belongs
to
the
dog
family
and
is
found
throughout
the
greater
part
of
north
america
also
in
europe
and
asia
and
parts
of
south
america
there
are
many
varieties
varying
greatly
in
size
and
color
but
there
are
probably
only
two
distinct
species
namely
the
timber
wolf
and
the
prairie
wolf
commonly
called
the
coyote
of
the
timber
wolves
we
have
in
this
country
the
following
varieties
the
small
dark
grey
or
black
wolf
of
florida
and
southeastern
united
states
the
red
wolf
or
southern
texas
the
brindled
wolf
of
mexico
the
light
grey
wolf
of
the
central
plains
region
the
dark
grey
wolf
of
eastern
canada
the
white
wolf
of
northern
canada
and
alaska
and
the
large
black
or
dusky
wolf
of
the
northwest
coast
region
of
the
smaller
prairie
wolf
there
are
also
several
varieties
they
being
found
throughout
the
prairie
regions
of
the
united
states
and
canada
extending
westward
to
the
foot
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
also
occurring
west
of
the
mountains
in
the
states
of
oregon
and
washington
to
the
trappers
and
the
western
people
in
general
these
two
species
are
commonly
known
as
the
wolf
and
the
coyote
pronounced
as
a
rule
the
varieties
of
timber
wolves
found
in
the
far
north
are
larger
than
those
of
the
south
while
they
are
found
in
fair
numbers
in
most
parts
of
the
regions
mentioned
the
prairie
wolf
or
coyote
is
far
more
abundant
in
the
sections
lying
east
of
the
mountains
there
being
in
most
localities
probably
fifty
coyotes
for
one
wolf
of
the
large
species
the
common
grey
wolf
of
the
western
stock
region
is
probably
most
abundant
and
the
most
destructive
to
stock
and
game
the
grey
wolf
varies
considerably
in
size
the
largest
specimens
weighing
sometimes
more
than
one
hundred
pounds
the
fur
is
long
and
heavy
and
good
prime
skins
bring
usually
from
two
to
five
dollars
each
in
former
times
when
the
buffalo
was
abundant
on
the
plains
they
formed
the
chief
food
of
the
wolf
but
since
the
buffalo
has
become
an
animal
of
the
past
the
wolves
depend
on
stock
for
food
they
are
very
destructive
to
cattle
horses
hogs
goats
etc
occasionally
a
herd
of
sheep
is
raided
but
this
is
of
rare
occurrence
as
the
sheep
are
always
guarded
by
the
herders
in
the
north
where
there
is
little
or
no
stock
raised
they
prey
on
game
of
almost
all
kinds
being
very
destructive
to
deer
and
even
killing
moose
at
times
they
also
follow
the
herds
of
cattle
which
range
in
the
mountains
during
the
summer
and
in
winter
are
found
in
the
foot
hills
the
coyote
preys
on
young
deer
and
antelope
and
on
small
game
such
as
rabbits
prairie
dogs
sage
hens
and
badgers
they
are
very
destructive
to
sheep
and
many
of
them
follow
the
sheep
when
they
are
driven
into
the
mountains
in
summer
the
breeding
season
of
the
grey
wolf
varies
considerably
some
being
born
in
the
summer
but
the
majority
are
born
in
march
and
april
the
mating
season
comes
mainly
in
january
and
february
there
are
usually
from
five
to
eleven
in
a
litter
they
breed
in
the
foot
hills
and
bad
lands
in
holes
in
the
buttes
and
and
sometimes
in
enlarged
badger
dens
the
breeding
season
of
the
coyote
generally
comes
later
than
that
of
the
grey
wolf
most
of
them
being
born
in
april
they
also
breed
in
natural
excavations
in
the
rocks
wolves
are
great
ramblers
and
range
over
a
large
section
of
country
like
all
other
animals
of
rambling
habits
they
have
a
regular
route
of
travel
and
while
they
vary
somewhat
from
the
route
you
may
be
certain
to
find
them
using
the
same
passes
through
the
hills
and
the
same
route
across
a
flat
however
when
in
pursuit
of
game
they
go
far
out
of
their
course
almost
all
of
the
states
where
wolves
are
found
as
well
as
some
of
the
provinces
of
canada
pay
a
bounty
on
wolves
and
coyotes
the
bounties
are
different
in
different
states
and
so
also
are
the
bounty
laws
and
the
methods
of
obtaining
the
bounty
money
usually
the
skin
and
head
or
part
of
the
head
or
the
feet
and
bones
of
the
legs
must
be
produced
in
order
to
obtain
this
bounty
besides
the
state
bounty
the
ranchmen
often
offer
an
additional
sum
which
in
most
cases
amounts
to
far
more
than
the
state
bounty
sometimes
when
some
particular
band
of
wolves
become
especially
destructive
to
stock
the
bounties
offered
for
these
wolves
amount
to
a
fancy
sum
of
money
on
one
particularly
destructive
wolf
in
the
state
of
wyoming
bounties
were
offered
amounting
to
five
hundred
dollars
of
course
such
instances
are
rare
but
in
most
cases
the
bounties
are
sufficient
to
make
wolf
trapping
profitable
even
in
the
summer
when
the
fur
is
of
no
value
for
trapping
grey
wolves
i
recommend
only
the
newhouse
trap
a
special
trap
is
manufactured
for
grey
wolves
no
it
has
an
spread
of
jaws
and
a
five
foot
chain
fitted
with
a
heavy
iron
drag
and
with
chain
complete
weighs
nine
pounds
however
many
trappers
consider
this
trap
too
heavy
and
the
no
newhouse
trap
is
used
more
than
any
other
when
these
traps
are
used
they
should
be
fitted
with
a
heavy
chain
of
suitable
length
and
a
pronged
drag
the
length
and
style
of
chain
needed
will
depend
much
on
the
method
of
setting
if
the
trap
is
to
be
staked
i
think
the
ordinary
length
of
chain
is
best
but
unless
there
are
two
or
more
traps
used
in
a
setting
i
would
not
advise
staking
the
trap
some
trappers
do
not
use
a
drag
but
wire
a
heavy
stone
to
the
end
of
the
chain
the
stone
should
be
fastened
securely
for
it
will
be
handled
pretty
roughly
if
a
wolf
gets
in
the
trap
for
the
coyote
i
recommend
the
nos
and
newhouse
the
and
hawley
norton
the
no
oneida
jump
trap
and
nos
and
victor
they
should
also
be
fitted
with
special
chains
unless
the
traps
are
to
be
staked
good
stakes
should
be
provided
and
they
should
be
about
fifteen
inches
long
unless
the
ground
is
very
soft
in
which
case
they
should
be
longer
as
good
is
scarce
in
many
parts
of
the
west
it
will
sometimes
be
best
to
have
iron
picket
pins
made
by
the
local
blacksmith
the
bait
for
the
grey
wolf
should
be
strictly
fresh
for
if
food
is
plenty
they
are
pretty
particular
any
of
their
favorite
foods
may
be
used
for
bait
for
the
coyote
horse
or
sheep
is
probably
best
but
prairie
dogs
rabbits
both
sage
and
jack
rabbits
sage
hens
badgers
make
good
bait
when
using
small
animals
for
bait
they
should
never
be
skinned
for
that
makes
the
animal
suspicious
many
different
kinds
of
scent
have
been
used
for
wolves
some
have
been
used
successfully
but
in
using
scent
one
should
also
use
good
sound
judgment
or
he
will
only
make
the
animal
suspicious
and
harder
to
trap
beaver
castor
and
chinese
musk
are
mildly
attractive
siberian
musk
is
very
attractive
to
both
the
grey
wolf
and
the
coyote
assafoetida
used
alone
is
worthless
but
may
be
mixed
with
other
scents
to
advantage
the
urine
of
the
wolf
bottled
and
kept
until
it
has
become
rancid
is
a
very
good
scent
and
the
sexual
organs
of
the
female
taken
when
in
heat
added
to
the
urine
makes
it
far
more
attractive
to
the
male
this
scent
is
most
successful
during
the
mating
season
and
should
be
used
without
bait
a
very
effective
scent
and
one
that
is
much
used
is
made
as
follows
place
half
a
pound
of
raw
beef
or
venison
in
a
wide
mouthed
bottle
and
let
it
stand
from
two
to
six
weeks
or
longer
or
until
it
is
thoroughly
decayed
and
the
odor
has
become
as
offensive
as
possible
if
the
meat
is
chopped
fine
it
will
aid
decomposition
when
thoroughly
decayed
add
a
quart
of
some
liquid
animal
oil
prairie
dog
oil
is
probably
best
and
ounce
of
assafoetida
dissolved
in
alcohol
and
one
ounce
of
tincture
of
siberian
musk
or
if
this
can
not
be
obtained
an
ounce
of
pulverized
beaver
castor
or
one
ounce
of
the
common
musk
used
as
perfumery
mix
thoroughly
and
bottle
securely
until
ready
for
use
this
scent
is
attractive
to
both
the
wolf
and
the
coyote
also
to
cattle
and
horses
and
in
using
it
the
traps
should
only
be
set
in
places
where
they
are
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
by
stock
illustration
scent
set
for
wolf
this
method
of
trapping
as
well
as
the
above
scent
formula
is
given
by
vernon
bailey
who
made
an
investigation
of
the
wolf
trouble
in
the
interests
of
the
biological
survey
and
the
department
of
forest
service
the
best
anchor
for
a
wolf
trap
is
a
stone
drag
of
or
pounds
weight
to
which
the
trap
is
securely
wired
a
long
oval
stone
is
best
but
a
triangular
or
square
stone
can
be
securely
wired
the
trap
stone
and
chain
should
be
buried
out
of
sight
close
to
a
runway
where
the
wolves
follow
a
trail
or
road
cross
a
narrow
pass
or
visit
a
carcass
with
the
trap
nearest
the
runway
and
when
covered
flush
with
the
surface
of
the
ground
to
keep
the
dirt
from
clogging
under
the
pan
the
pan
and
jaws
should
be
covered
with
a
clean
oval
shaped
paper
and
over
this
should
be
sprinkled
fine
earth
until
the
surface
is
smooth
and
all
traces
of
paper
and
trap
have
been
concealed
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
the
surroundings
should
appear
as
nearly
as
possible
undisturbed
the
dust
may
be
made
to
look
natural
again
by
sprinkling
with
water
touching
the
ground
or
other
objects
with
the
hands
spitting
near
the
trap
or
in
any
way
leaving
a
trace
of
human
odor
nearby
should
be
avoided
old
well
scented
gloves
should
be
used
while
handling
the
trap
and
making
the
set
and
a
little
of
the
scent
used
for
the
traps
should
be
rubbed
on
the
shoe
soles
a
piece
of
old
cowhide
may
be
used
to
stand
on
and
on
which
to
place
the
loose
dirt
when
burying
the
drag
and
trap
place
the
scent
about
inches
beyond
the
trap
and
a
very
little
may
be
sprinkled
over
the
trap
to
the
trail
if
possible
place
the
trap
between
two
tufts
of
grass
or
weeds
so
that
it
can
be
readily
approached
from
one
side
only
as
many
of
the
wolf
trappers
do
not
believe
in
scent
the
following
methods
are
given
they
are
methods
that
have
been
thoroughly
tested
and
are
being
used
today
by
some
of
the
best
trappers
the
first
method
is
a
trail
set
for
use
with
a
large
bait
and
is
equally
good
for
grey
wolves
and
coyotes
it
should
be
remembered
however
that
trail
sets
of
any
kind
can
not
be
used
to
advantage
if
there
is
much
stock
about
find
a
well
defined
stock
trail
somewhere
on
the
wolf
route
of
travel
and
set
two
traps
close
together
on
the
trail
then
go
on
from
fifty
to
one
hundred
yards
and
set
two
more
in
exactly
the
same
manner
use
care
in
setting
the
traps
so
as
to
leave
everything
looking
the
same
as
before
you
can
wear
gloves
if
you
like
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
much
gained
by
doing
so
for
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
set
without
leaving
some
human
scent
the
scent
will
pass
away
in
a
day
or
two
and
few
trappers
count
on
making
a
catch
until
after
the
traps
have
been
set
a
couple
of
days
a
large
bait
should
be
placed
close
along
the
trail
and
midway
between
the
two
settings
when
the
wolves
get
to
feeding
on
the
bait
they
will
travel
on
the
trail
and
will
not
be
looking
for
danger
so
far
from
the
bait
if
desired
only
one
trap
need
be
set
in
a
place
but
two
are
better
as
the
wolf
is
likely
to
step
over
the
trap
if
only
one
is
used
it
is
a
good
plan
to
set
the
traps
several
days
before
placing
the
bait
so
as
to
allow
time
for
the
human
scent
to
pass
away
and
the
setting
to
take
on
a
more
smooth
appearance
here
is
a
method
that
is
much
used
for
both
wolves
and
coyotes
it
requires
three
or
four
traps
and
they
should
all
be
fastened
securely
to
one
stout
stake
find
a
smooth
sandy
spot
and
scoop
out
a
little
hollow
and
drive
the
stake
down
until
the
top
is
below
the
level
of
the
ground
fasten
your
bait
securely
to
the
top
of
the
stake
so
as
to
hide
the
stake
and
prevent
the
wolf
or
coyote
from
taking
the
bait
away
if
three
traps
are
used
spread
them
out
in
the
form
of
a
triangle
if
four
are
used
arrange
them
in
the
form
of
a
square
set
the
traps
very
carefully
so
that
when
they
are
covered
everything
will
be
smooth
and
looking
just
like
it
did
before
as
the
bait
is
fastened
the
wolf
can
not
take
it
away
and
in
trying
to
pull
it
up
will
step
in
one
of
the
traps
he
is
almost
certain
to
get
in
another
one
when
he
commences
to
struggle
and
there
is
little
danger
of
him
escaping
if
a
place
can
be
found
where
the

may
be
set
between
bunches
of

bank
set
for

another
very
good
method
is
to
set
a
trap
on
top
of
a
straight
or
bank
from
four
to
eight
feet
high
so
that
when
the
animal
is

it
will
leap
or
fall
over
the

fix
the
bait
on
the

fasten
the
bait
with
a
small
stake

drive
the
stake
out

stake
the
trap
just
the
length
of
the
chain
from

are
expected
cover
the

very
carefully
if
two
bunches
of
cactus
can
not
be
found
growing
close

get
some
and
place
it
there
so
that
it
will
look
natural

have
the
appearance

a
single
trap
may
be
set
almost
anywhere
and
small
pieces
of
bait
scattered
around

in
this
way
you
can
bait
the
trap
without
dismounting
from
your
horse
and
avoid
leaving

vasma
brown
a
noted
trapper
of
texas
gives
the
following
method
take
a
large
piece
of
fresh
meat
and
drag
it
along
a
trail
stop
occasionally
and
set
a
trap
just
outside
of
the
edge
of
the
trail
where
the
stock
will
not
step
in
it
dig
out
a
place
for
the
trap
and
set
the
trap
covering
first
with
a
piece
of
paper
and
finishing
with
sand
leaving
the
place
looking
just
like
it
did
before
cut
some
of
the
meat
in
small
pieces
and
scatter
them
around
the
trap
use
no
scent
fresh
pork
is
the
best
scent
you
can
get
if
you
can
find
some
animal
that
the
wolves
themselves
have
killed
do
not
fail
to
set
traps
there
immediately
when
trapping
around
a
large
bait
sometimes
the
animals
will
not
approach
close
enough
to
be
caught
in
such
cases
a
small
bait
may
sometimes
be
used
to
advantage
by
setting
traps
a
short
distance
away
the
tail
of
a
skunk
is
said
to
be
an
unfailing
lure
do
not
smoke
or
grease
your
traps
or
the
wolf
is
sure
to
locate
them
at
once
sometimes
a
badger
will
be
caught
in
a
wolf
trap
if
so
do
not
skin
it
but
kill
it
and
set
the
trap
close
by
it
will
make
a
fine
bait
and
the
trap
may
be
set
in
the
ground
that
the
animal
has
dug
up
leaving
no
signs
of
human
presence
when
trapping
during
freezing
weather
fill
in
around
the
jaws
and
springs
of
the
traps
with
sage
leaves
or
some
similar
dry
material
before
covering
with
dirt
always
carry
a
rifle
with
you
when
tending
the
traps
you
will
get
shots
at
wolves
or
coyotes
almost
every
day
when
visiting
wolf
traps
always
go
on
horseback
and
if
possible
avoid
dismounting
near
the
traps
dark
cold
stormy
nights
are
the
best
for
the
wolf
trapper
use
plenty
of
traps
the
more
chances
you
have
the
better
success
you
will
have
sometimes
a
coyote
will
uncover
a
trap
or
dig
it
up
and
spring
it
nothing
can
prevent
this
your
only
remedy
is
to
have
lots
of
traps
set
and
if
he
fools
you
in
one
set
you
may
fool
him
in
another
in
warm
weather
if
you
can
set
out
a
line
of
traps
just
before
a
rain
your
chances
for
making
a
good
catch
are
very
good
as
the
rain
washes
away
all
human
odors
and
helps
to
smooth
over
the

a
light

will
often
help
to

the

one
and
its
members
are
found
scattered
over
the
greater
part
of
the
globe
australia
and

they
range
through
all
latitudes
from

of
basking
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
they
are
the
smallest
members
of
the
family
and
live
exclusively
on
vegetables
bears
differ
from
each
other
in
consequences
of
the
differences
of
climate
more
than
almost
any
other
animal
those
that
inhabit
the
far
north
and
such
high
cold
regions
as
the
rocky
mountains
are
monsters
of
great
strength
and
ferocity
while
those
that
inhabit
warm
countries
are
small
feeble
and
inoffensive
the
smallest
of
all
is
the
bornean
bear
while
the
alaskan
brown
bear
is
probably
the
largest
the
grizzly
or
silver
tip
and
the
polar
bears
are
very
large
the
american
black
bear
is
probably
the
most
numerous
of
the
family
and
is
one
of
most
interest
to
the
trappers
with
the
exception
of
the
prairie
country
they
are
found
scattered
over
almost
all
of
the
united
states
and
a
large
part
of
canada
and
alaska
the
cinnamon
is
only
a
color
variety
of
the
black
bear
differing
only
in
color
both
kinds
are
found
in
the
same
litter
in
some
sections
as
for
instance
in
some
of
the
northwestern
states
and
in
mexico
the
cinnamon
bear
predominates
while
in
the
east
and
north
they
are
very
rare
the
average
weight
of
the
black
bear
when
full
grown
is
from
two
hundred
to
three
hundred
pounds
but
specimens
have
been
killed
weighing
far
more
than
these
figures
the
fur
is
fine
and
soft
and
usually
of
a
jet
black
color
bears
of
all
kinds
with
the
exception
of
the
sun
bears
and
the
polar
bear
feed
on
both
vegetable
and
animal
food
the
polar
bear
lives
entirely
on
fish
and
flesh
bears
with
the
exception
of
the
polar
species
hibernate
in
winter
they
usually
den
in
the
ground
or
rocks
but
sometimes
in
a
hollow
log
or
tree
the
mating
season
is
in
july
and
august
and
the
young
usually
two
are
born
in
january
february
and
march
they
remain
with
the
mother
until
fall
and
sometimes
longer
in
sections
where
they
are
found
in
fair
numbers
they
form
trails
through
passes
in
the
mountains
along
the
bottoms
of
the
cliffs
around
points
of
the
lakes
and
in
other
places
of
like
nature
these
trails
may
be
easily
distinguished
from
the
paths
of
other
animals
by
the
marks
on
the
trees
at
intervals
all
along
the
trail
the
bear
will
stand
on
his
hind
feet
by
the
side
of
a
tree
gnaw
a
circle
around
the
tree
about
five
feet
above
the
ground
i
am
told
that
this
marking
is
done
during
the
mating
season
the
trails
are
traveled
more
in
the
spring
and
summer
than
in
the
fall
bears
are
very
fond
of
fish
and
in
the
north
when
fish
are
in
the
streams
spawning
the
bears
spend
much
of
their
time
fishing
at
the
foot
of
the
falls
the
sucker
is
the
first
fish
to
spawn
and
as
soon
as
they
are
gone
the
pike
come
and
the
bears
fare
well
for
a
couple
of
weeks
after
that
they
feed
on
the
leaves
of
the
poplar
insects
berries
and
nuts
and
whatever
meat
they
can
find
in
some
sections
they
remain
in
the
same
locality
during
the
entire
year
in
other
places
they
migrate
on
the
approach
of
cold
weather
and
do
not
return
until
spring
the
bear
becomes
prime
about
the
first
to
the
fifteenth
of
november
and
remains
in
good
condition
until
late
in
the
spring
in
northern
sections
they
do
not
commence
shedding
until
june
fifteenth
and
sometimes
even
later
the
best
time
to
trap
them
is
in
the
spring
just
after
the
snow
is
gone
but
many
are
trapped
in
the
fall
the
traps
for
black
bears
are
the
nos
and
and
the
nos
and
newhouse
for
larger
bears
the
no
is
the
trap
to
use
although
many
grizzly
bears
are
caught
in
the
no
the
most
common
method
for
trapping
bears
is
the
following
make
a
sort
of
enclosure
of
old
logs
brush
in
the
form
of
a
v
about
eight
feet
long
and
two
or
three
feet
wide
at
the
entrance
it
should
be
three
feet
high
behind
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
it
so
high
in
front
the
bait
should
be
fastened
in
the
back
of
the
pen
and
the
trap
set
in
the
entrance
take
a
small
springy
stick
about
eight
inches
long
and
spring
it
under
the
pan
of
the
trap
to
prevent
small
animals
from
being
caught
to
do
this
stick
one
end
firmly
in
the
ground
and
bend
the
other
end
down
and
hook
it
under
the
pan
the
trap
when
set
should
support
a
weight
of
pounds
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
most
trappers
allow
the
trap
to
spring
too
easily
always
turn
the
loose
jaw
up
and
work
from
in
under
for
the
sake
of
safety
now
drive
down
a
couple
of
stakes
on
each
side
of
the
trap
so
as
to
leave
only
a
narrow
passage
cover
the
trap
with
leaves
or
moss
it
is
a
good
idea
to
put
a
good
sized
piece
of
moss
over
the
pan
to
cause
the
bear
to
step
in
the
center
of
the
trap
some
trappers
put
sharp
sticks
around
the
outside
of
the
jaws
others
lay
a
stick
across
the
mouth
of
the
pen
about
six
or
eight
inches
high
and
close
up
to
the
jaws
in
stepping
over
it
the
bear
is
more
likely
to
put
his
foot
in
the
trap
the
trap
should
be
fastened
to
a
heavy
clog
of
hardwood
for
the
black
bear
the
clog
should
be
about
six
or
seven
feet
long
and
just
small
enough
to
go
through
the
ring
on
the
chain
the
ring
should
be
slipped
on
to
the
middle
and
fastened
with
a
spike
for
the
grizzly
and
other
large
bears
the
clog
should
be
larger
this
is
the
best
method
but
if
you
nip
a
bear
once
you
will
have
to
try
some
other
method
and
it
is
not
likely
that
you
will
catch
him
even
then
as
they
become
very
cunning
do
not
set
the
trap
at
the
same
place
but
find
his
trail
and
make
a
blind
set
preferably
where
the
trail
leads
through
a
pool
of
water
of
course
you
must
be
sure
that
no
person
will
travel
on
the
trail
some
trappers
prefer
to
hang
a
bait
about
six
feet
above
the
trap
and
do
not
use
any
pen
bears
may
also
be
trapped
successfully
with
snares
and
deadfalls
but
the
objection
to
these
traps
is
that
the
animal
is
killed
instantly
and
if
the
traps
are
not
visited
daily
the
skin
is
likely
to
spoil
for
bait
there
is
nothing
better
than
fish
but
pork
either
salt
or
fresh
mutton
beef
or
any
kind
of
large
game
is
good
even
the
flesh
of
the
bear
makes
fair
bait
beaver
otter
or
muskrat
meat
is
also
good
honey
is
very
attractive
there
are
a
number
of
scents
that
are
attractive
to
the
bear
such
as
fish
oil
oil
of
anise
and
beaver
castor
the
scent
recommended
for
the
raccoon
is
good
for
the
bear
the
track
of
the
bear
is
easily
distinguished
from
that
of
other
animals
because
of
its
large
size
ordinarily
the
bear
mode
of
locomotion
is
a
shuffling
walk
the
footprints
of
a
large
black
bear
will
measure
about
eight
inches
in

a
nocturnal
animal
is
omnivorous
and
hibernates
during
cold
weather
coming
out
in
search
of
food
only
on
warm
nights
this
food
consists
of
green
corn
grapes

fruits
fish
frogs
clams
birds
and
their
eggs
and
they
are
also
fond
of
poultry
in

travel
mostly
along
the
streams
and
in

fall
in

fields
they
den
in
hollow
trees
having
an
entrance
at

of
a
pen
of
stakes
at
the
edge
of
the
water
where
the
animals
travel
the
trap
may
be
set
dry
or
under
water
as
preferred
and
the
bait
should
be
placed
in
the
back
of
the
pen
another
very
good
method
much
used
in
the
south
is
to
fasten
a
piece
of
bright
tin
or
a
piece
of
a
white
dish
on
the
pan
of
the
trap
and
set
the
trap
under
about
two
inches
of
water
near
the
bank
no
bait
is
used
but
a
little
scent
may
be
used
on
the
bank
to
good
advantage
the
southern
trappers
sometimes
find
a
tree
stump
or
rock
in
the
edge
of
the
water
and
set
the
trap
in
the
water
just
where
the
will
walk
when
passing
around
the
obstruction
a
fence
made
of
brush
will
answer
the
same
purpose
where
the
bank
is
steep
and
the
water
is
shallow
dig
a
six
inch
hole
straight
into
the
bank
at
the
edge
of
the
water
fasten
some
bait
in
the
back
of
the
hole
and
set
the
trap
in
the
water
directly
in
front
of
the
hole
where
coons
are
visiting
a
corn
field
find
where
they
go
through
the
fence
and
you
will
sometimes
find
a
well
beaten
trail
set
the
trap
in
the
trail
covered
and
fasten
to
a
clog
if
you
find
a
log
lying
across
the
stream
and
there
are
signs
of
about
cut
a
notch
in
the
top
of
the
log
and
set
the
trap
in
the
notch
covering
with
rotten
wood
or
moss
you
are
likely
to
catch
a
fox
in
a
set
of
this
kind
when
a
den
tree
can
be
found
cut
a
pole
five
or
six
feet
long
and
six
inches
thick
lean
it
against
the
tree
and
set
the
trap
on
the
pole
cover
the
trap
lightly
with
moss
and
staple
to
the
tree
any
natural
enclosure
along
a
stream
such
as
a
hollow
log
or
a
hole
under
a
stump
makes
a
good
place
to
set
a
trap
when
trapping
for
foxes
with
water
sets
many
coons
will
be
caught
in
the
traps
one
of
the
best
scents
for
is
made
as
follows
to
a
pint
of
fish
oil
add
twenty
or
thirty
drops
of
oil
of
anise
and
two
ounces
of
strained
honey
pure
fish
oil
is
used
by
some
trappers
and
beaver
castor
muskrat
musk
and
oil
of
anise
are
also
good
the
trail
of
the
raccoon
is
somewhat
like
that
of
the
mink
but
the
tracks
are
larger
the
animal
makes
the
print
of
the
entire
foot
and
the
long
slender
toes
show
plainly
the
print
of
the
hind
foot
will
be
from
two
and
a

to
three
inches

the

badgers
are
burrowing
carnivorous
animals
they
are
found
in
north
america
and
various
parts
of
the
old
world
one
species
being
found
in
europe
one
in
india
and
another
in
japan
there
are
several
varieties
of
the
american
species
and
they
are
found
at
present
only
west
of
the
mississippi
river
although
formerly
they
ranged
as
far
east
as
ohio
they
are
perhaps
most
numerous
on
the
high
dry
plains
just
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
range
from
mexico
to
well
up
into
canada
they
were
at
one
time
quite
numerous
in
wisconsin
and
minnesota
as
well
as
others
of
the
northern
and
central
states
but
today
are
found
but
rarely
in
those
sections
wisconsin
is
sometimes
called
the
badger
state
because
of
the
numbers
of
these
animals
found
there
by
the
early
settlers
the
badger
is
an
animal
of
peculiar
build
having
a
heavy
broad
body
at
times
appearing
almost
flat
as
when
it
crouches
close
to
the
ground
and
the
legs
are
short
and
stout
the
feet
are
furnished
with
long
strong
claws
adapted
for
digging
the
tail
is
short
the
ears
short
and
round
the
eyes
small
and
black
a
full
grown
specimen
will
measure
about
two
feet
or
more
from
the
end
of
the
nose
to
the
base
of
the
tail
the
color
is
a
grizzly
yellowish
grey
being
darker
on
the
back
a
white
line
traverses
the
face
head
and
neck
bordered
with
black
which
latter
marking
extends
around
the
eyes
the
sides
of
the
face
and
the
throat
are
white
and
there
is
a
black
patch
in
front
of
each
ear
the
legs
and
feet
are
black
the
back
and
sides
of
the
body
are
mottled
somewhat
by
narrow
streaks
of
darker
fur
the
fur
or
more
properly
speaking
the
hair
is
long
and
appears
to
be
parted
on
the
back
as
it
hangs
off
to
either
side
from
a
line
down
the
center
of
the
back
each
separate
hair
shows
a
number
of
colors
and
it
is
this
which
gives
the
animal
the
peculiar
grizzled
appearance
although
the
animal
is
as
before
stated
of
a
heavy
build
the
casual
observer
would
scarcely
credit
the
animal
with
the
great
strength
which
it
really
possesses
because
of
the
apparently
soft
and
flabby
body
however
the
strength
of
the
animal
is
surprising
they
are
slow
moving
creatures
and
were
it
not
for
their
strength
and
powers
of
digging
they
would
have
difficulty
in
procuring
a
sufficient
amount
of
food
they
feed
on
the
small
burrowing
animals
mainly
such
as
the
prairie
dog
the
gopher
and
the
pouched
rat
and
they
are
enabled
to
capture
many
of
these
animals
by
digging
them
out
of
the
dens
they
also
eat
mice
and
reptiles
and
the
eggs
and
young
of
birds
being
such
an
expert
digger
the
badger
makes
a
deep
den
the
entrance
to
the
den
is
wide
and
surrounded
by
a
mound
of
earth
in
addition
to
the
main
den
the
animal
has
a
number
of
others
nearby
so
that
one
would
scarcely
know
which
of
them
is
the
main
burrow
they
are
hibernating
animals
and
remain
in
the
dens
during
the
cold
portion
of
the
winter
the
animal
is
of
a
rather
timid
nature
and
when
alarmed
seeks
safety
in
the
den
if
possible
but
when
surprised
far
from
the
den
will
hide
wherever
possible
and
failing
to
find
cover
will
flatten
down
close
to
the
ground
and
by
remaining
very
quiet
will
try
to
escape
notice
however
when
pursued
and
finding
escape
impossible
they
will
fight
desperately
the
young
are
born
in
early
spring
there
being
as
a
rule
three
or
four
in
a
litter
the
fur
of
the
badger
is
used
for
making
brushes
of
various
kinds
its
peculiar
texture
making
it
especially
desirable
for
this
purpose
it
is
not
used
for
wearing
apparel
the
no
trap
is
the
proper
size
to
use
for
this
animal
and
only
the
stronger
ones
should
be
used
they
are
caught
and
held
occasionally
in
smaller
and
weaker
traps
yet
such
cases
are
exceptional
as
the
animal
is
not
a
valuable
one
and
is
not
found
in
large
numbers
in
any
one
locality
they
are
not
much
sought
by
the
trappers
and
the
most
of
the
skins
which
reach
the
market
are
from
the
animals
caught
in
traps
set
for
other
game
the
wolf
and
coyote
trappers
catch
them
occasionally
as
they
may
be
captured
by
any
of
the
methods
used
for
those
animals
perhaps
the
best
way
in
which
to
capture
the
badger
is
to
set
the
trap
at
the
entrance
to
the
main
burrow
that
is
the
one
showing
the
most
use
the
trap
should
be
set
just
outside
of
the
entrance
and
should
be
securely
staked
using
a
long
stake
driven
out
of
sight
in
the
ground
the
jaws
of
the
trap
should
be
parallel
with
the
passage
so
that
the
badger
will
step
between
the
jaws
and
not
over
them
it
should
be
bedded
down
so
that
the
covering
will
be
flush
with
the
surroundings
traps
may
also
be
set

may
be

setting
being
so
arranged
that
the
badger
will
be
obliged
to
walk
over
the

to
reach

the

chapter
xv
the
opossum
the
opossum
is
the
only
american
member
of
the
family
of
pouched
animals
only
one
species
is
found
in
this
country
although
others
are
found
in
other
parts
of
the
world
of
the
american
species
naturalists
have
discovered
three
varieties
namely
the
virginia
opossum
the
florida
opossum
and
the
texas
opossum
all
very
similar
the
virginia
opossum
is
the
most
common
and
the
most
widely
distributed
being
found
as
far
north
as
pennsylvania
and
ohio
and
from
there
westward
to
nebraska
and
southward
in
the
southwest
the
texas
opossum
is
found
in
general
form
the
opossum
resembles
the
house
rat
but
is
much
larger
the
tail
is
almost
bare
and
is
prehensile
that
is
it
is
capable
of
holding
on
to
anything
which
it
encircles
the
muzzle
is
long
and
pointed
the
ears
bare
in
color
this
animal
is
generally
a
grizzly
gray
but
some
specimens
are
much
darker
than
others
the
fur
is
long
soft
and
fluffy
the
opossum
dens
in
the
ground
and
the
abode
is
usually
located
under
a
stump
or
rock
the
burrows
are
shallow
and
terminate
in
a
larger
cavity
lined
with
dry
leaves
they
also
sometimes
locate
in
hollow
logs
they
are
found
only
in
timbered
districts
and
are
active
climbers
their
food
consists
mainly
of
mice
eggs
and
young
birds
and
insects
but
they
are
also
fond
of
poultry
and
almost
any
kind
of
flesh
fresh
or
tainted
they
are
not
strictly
carnivorous
as
they
feed
on
persimmons
polk
berries
and
other
wild
fruits
they
are
slow
moving
and
stupid
creatures
and
have
no
means
of
defending
themselves
against
their
enemies
it
is
true
that
they
do
have
a
habit
of
feigning
death
when
frightened
but
this
trick
is
of
no
value
in
case
of
an
attack
from
other
animals
for
no
wild
animal
would
be
deceived
and
even
if
it
were
there
would
be
no
hope
for
the
opossum
for
it
would
only
be
a
case
of
a
meal
already
prepared
for
the
attacking
animal
on
other
occasions
instead
of
feigning
death
the
animal
will
open
its
mouth
and
present
a
rather
fierce
appearance
but
there
is
little
danger
of
them
biting
while
the
opossum
is
not
a
hibernating
animal
it
remains
in
its
den
during
cold
weather
it
is
a
southern
animal
and
the
severe
winters
in
the
northern
parts
of
its
range
are
not
to
the
animal
liking
they
are
most
active
on
warm
damp
nights
for
they
do
not
like
to
move
about
when
the
weather
is
dry
and
the
leaves
are
rustly
they
are
very
prolific
bringing
forth
from
six
to
twelve
young
at
a
litter
and
in
some
cases
even
more
when
newly
born
they
are
very
small
and
imperfectly
formed
and
are
carried
by
the
mother
in
the
pouch
on
the
under
side
of
the
body
until
large
enough
to
travel
they
become
prime
about
the
second
week
of
november
in
the
north
and
remain
in
good
condition
until
march
in
the
south
they
do
not
become
prime
until
about
december
and
commence
to
shed
much
earlier
than
in
the
north
the
fur
is
not
a
very
valuable
one
but
there
is
a
growing
demand
for
the
flesh
which
is
used
as
food
and
in
many
places
will
meet
with
ready
sale
i
recommend
the
no
trap
for
this
animal
and
those
of
medium
strength
of
spring
only
as
the
opossum
foot
and
leg
is
tender
and
if
the
bones
are
broken
the
animal
is
likely
to
escape
they
do
not
struggle
much
however
and
comparatively
few
escape
from
the
traps
i
set
my
traps
in
the
thick
woods
usually
in
the
gullies
also
along
the
edges
of
the
woods
along
fences
etc
the
opossum
is
possessed
of
no
cunning
whatever
and
no
special
care
is
needed
in
setting
the
traps
if
this
animal
alone
is
expected
however
it
is
always
best
to
use
care
in
setting
for
the
most
stupid
animals
as
one
never
knows
what
animal
may
pass
that
way
whenever
possible
i
place
the
trap
in
a
natural
enclosure
such
as
a
hollow
in
the
side
of
a
stump
or
tree
a
hollow
between
two
spreading
roots
an
opening
among
rocks
or
in
a
hollow
log
failing
to
find
any
such
place
i
construct
a
small
enclosure
of
stakes
bark
stones
or
pieces
of
rotten
wood
whichever
is
most
convenient
and
set
the
trap
in
the
entrance
nesting
it
down
and
covering
with
whatever
is
found
nearby
the
trap
may
be
staked
stapled
or
fastened
to
a
clog
for
bait
i
use
rabbit
fowl
muskrat
or
small
birds
of
any
kind
bait
may
be
fresh
or
tainted
as
the
opossum
is
not
particular
i
have
heard
of
many
fancy
sets
and
baits
and
have
given
some
of
them
a
trial
but
find
the
method
given
above
to
be
the
most
satisfactory
opossums
will
sometimes
be
caught
in
traps
set
for
skunks
foxes
and
other
animals
and
there
are
probably
more
of
them
caught
in
such
sets
than
in
any
other
they
may
also
be
caught
in
wooden
traps
i
have
caught
these
animals
in
traps
set
on
logs
spanning
the
streams
also
at
the
entrance
of
the
dens
but
if
i
were
setting
many
traps
for
opossums
i
would
use
the
above
method
mostly
the
opossum
makes
a
wandering
aimless
sort
of
trail
quite
broad
for
an
animal
of
its
size
and
the
toes
are
turned
outward

the
west
they
are
found
in
the
timbered
parts
of

mountains
in
the
north
you
will
find
their
tracks
leading
along
the
edges
of
the
swamps
and
alder
or
willow
thickets
their
food
consists
mostly
of
rabbits
and
partridge
the
rabbit
falls
an
easy
victim
they
have
been
known
to
kill
small
deer
and
caribou
but
only
in
very
rare
instances
there
has
been
considerable
controversy
among
naturalists
regarding
the
courage
of
the
lynx
from
my
own
observations
i
should
say
that
they
are
very
cowardly
as
a
rule
but
all
rules
have
exceptions
i
know
of
two
instances
in
which
the
lynx
has
stood
his
ground
for
a
man
and
in
one
case
for
a
number
of
men
this
lynx
was
killed
by
an
axe
thrown
by
one
of
the
men
at
a
distance
of
twelve
feet
in
traveling
the
lynx
usually
walks
only
running
when
in
pursuit
of
some
animal
and
always
traveling
the
same
route
they
are
active
all
winter
but
travel
most
in
fall
and
spring
they
become
prime
about
the
first
of
november
and
if
the
spring
is
late
will
remain
in
good
condition
until
the
middle
of
april
the
european
lynx
closely
resembles
the
canadian
in
habits
and
appearance
its
general
color
is
a
dull
reddish
grey
mottled
with
black
in
winter
the
fur
is
longer
and
lighter
colored
than
in
summer
it
is
found
from
the
pryenees
to
the
far
north
and
eastward
throughout
northern
asia
as
a
rule
the
lynx
is
easily
taken
with
the
steel
trap
unless
food
is
very
plentiful
when
they
do
not
care
for
dead
bait
almost
any
trap
will
hold
them
as
they
do
not
struggle
much
and
i
have
caught
a
number
of
them
with
the
no
trap
but
because
of
their
large
feet
i
would
advise
the
use
of
a
larger
trap
the
nos
and
traps
are
perhaps
the
best
sizes
to
use
there
are
various
methods
of
trapping
them
but
the
most
common
as
well
as
the
best
is
to
set
the
trap
in
an
enclosure
with
bait
i
prefer
to
make
the
enclosures
of
split
wood
placing
the
split
side
inward
i
make
the
pen
about
three
feet
in
height
about
two
and
a
half
feet
long
wide
at
the
top
and
just
wide
enough
to
receive
the
trap
at
the
bottom
the
pen
should
be
well
roofed
with
evergreen
boughs
to
protect
the
trap
from
the
snow
and
the
trap
should
be
just
inside
of
the
entrance
if
there
is
snow
on
the
ground
i
make
a
bed
of
green
boughs
for
the
trap
to
rest
on
it
is
not
necessary
to
cover
the
trap
but
i
prefer
to
do
so
the
bait
should
be
placed
on
a
stick
in
the
back
of
the
pen
rabbit
and
partridge
is
the
best
bait
but
it
must
be
fresh
as
the
lynx
does
not
care
for
stale
food
some
scent
should
also
be
used
as
the
lynx
sense
of
smell
is
not
so
highly
developed
as
that
of
some
other
animals
beaver
castor
is
perhaps
the
best
but
fish
oil
is
much
used
by
the
western
trappers
muskrat
musk
is
also
good
the
trap
should
be
fastened
to
a
stout
clog
i
use
a
small
spruce
or
balsam
tree
about
three
inches
thick
at
the
butt
and
fasten
the
trap
by
stapling
or
by
looping
the
chain
around
the
clog
leaving
some
snags
to
prevent
the
chain
from
slipping
over
the
end
the
rabbits
are
a
great
nuisance
they
being
found
in
great
numbers
in
the
northern
swamps
the
scent
of
the
hands
left
there
while
setting
the
trap
also
the
fresh
cutting
attracts
the
rabbit
into
the
pen
and
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
keep
the
trap
in
working
order
until
the
lynx
journeys
by
that
way
again
the
best
way
i
have
found
to
keep
them
out
of
the
trap
is
by
dropping
some
dead
brush
in
front
of
the
enclosure
as
the
rabbits
do
not
like
to
jump
through
the
dead
brush
squirrels
and
birds
are
also
troublesome
and
i
have
found
it
a
good
idea
to
place
the
bait
well
up
under
the
roof
of
the
pen
so
as
to
be
out
of
sight
of
these
creatures
i
also
place
a
small
springy
stick
under
the
pan
of
the
trap
which
will
sometimes
prevent
the
squirrels
and
birds
from
springing
it
i
sometimes
make
a
trap
pen
by
standing
up
a
number
of
small
evergreen
trees
cutting
the
boughs
away
on
the
inside
this
is
a
very
good
method
when
lynx
do
not
take
bait
well
some
trappers
make
a
long
pen
or
passage
open
at
both
ends
and
high
enough
so
that
the
lynx
can
walk
through
easily
the
trap
is
set
inside
and
some
beaver
castor
or
other
scent
is
placed
on
a
stick
in
the
passage
others
put
scent
on
a
piece
of
red
cloth
and
fix
it
in
a
pen
of
brush
setting
the
trap
in
the
entrance
as
the
lynx
eye
is
more
keen
than
its
nose
i
have
found
it
a
good
plan
to
hang
a
rabbit
skin
from
a
string
near
the
setting
so
that
it
will
swing
about
in
the
breeze
this
will
attract
the
animal
for
quite
a
distance
and
is
a
good
method
to
use
when
setting
traps
along
the
shore
of
a
lake
as
the
lynx
walks
the
ice
and
will
sometimes
pass
outside
of
scenting
distance
of
the
trap
lynx
are
easily
killed
by
a
blow
from
a
stick
but
when
caught
in
small
traps
it
is
safer
to
shoot
them
using
a
small
caliber
pistol
or
rifle
another
good
way
is
to
choke
them
by
tieing
a
snare
to
the
end
of
a
ten
or
twelve
foot
pole
slip
the
snare
over
the
head
draw
it
tight
and
hold
the
pole
the
lynx
will
die
in
a
very
short
time
the
advantage
of
this
method
is
in
the
fact
that
the
skin
is
kept
clean
and
free
from
blood
the
track
of
the
lynx
resembles
that
of
the
cat
but
is
much
larger
a
large
specimen
will
make
a
track
three
and
a
half
inches
in
diameter
and
the
length
of
step
is
from
sixteen
to
eighteen
inches

some

where
they

some
naturalists
claim
that
the
cougar
of

and
other
parts
of
the
south
is
a
distinct
variety
cougars
prey
largely
on
deer
also
in
some
sections
on
the
wild
sheep
and
goats
they
also
kill
small
animals
and
when
pressed
by
hunger
they
will
not
hesitate
to
attack
larger
animals
than
the
deer
even
the
moose
is
sometimes
killed
by

they
are
very
destructive
to
stock
in

of

western

as
well
as
the
stockmen
pay
bounty
on
cougars
in
south
america
they
kill
large
numbers
of
wild
cattle
their
method
of
securing
game
is
by
creeping
cautiously
to
within
springing
distance
or
by
watching
a
runway
from
the
branches
of
a
tree
or
a
ledge
of
rock
from
which
position
they
spring
upon
the
unsuspecting
victim
breaking
its
neck
by
a
twist
of
the
head
when
they
can
get
plenty
of
food
they
only
suck
the
blood
of
the
captured
animal
and
do
not
return
to
the
carcass
when
food
is
scarce
they
make
a
meal
of
the
flesh
and
cover
the
remains
in
such
cases
they
may
return
for
a
second
meal
it
was
only
after
the
panther
became
rare
in
the
eastern
states
that
the
fabulous
tales
of
their
daring
and
their
inclination
to
attack
human
beings
originated
and
such
stories
are
never
credited
by
those
who
are
acquainted
with
the
nature
and
habits
of
the
animal
while
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
for
the
cougar
to
kill
an
unarmed
man
they
are
by
nature
timid
animals
and
not
to
be
feared
by
human
beings
while
individual
animals
may
attack
man
on
rare
instances
such
occurrences
are
very
rare
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
of
the
panther
stories
have
no
foundation
whatever
the
western
mountain
men
consider
them
very
cowardly
animals

cougars
live
in

places
that
are

there
is
no
method
known

may
be
successfully
trapped
owing
to
their
rambling
habits
one
never
knows
where
to
place
a
trap
for
them
and
as
they
prefer
to
kill
their
own
game
they
will
seldom
touch
bait
as
a
rule
they
do
not
return
to
the
carcass
of
their
victim
but
if
one
can
find
an
animal
freshly
killed
it
is
a
good
plan
to
set
a
trap
by
the
side
of
the
remains
and
in
case
the
animal
should
return
for
a
second
meal
its
capture
is
likely
practically
all
of
those
which
are
trapped
are
taken
in
this
way
the
no
newhouse
trap
is
used
but
the
no
is
better
for
being
a
larger
and
stronger
trap
it
is
more
certain
to
hold

the

should
be
fastened
to
a
heavy
clog
and
the

and
clog

is
wary
and
suspicious
on
rare
instances
when
the
trapper
has
been
certain
that
there
were
cougars
in

near
vicinity
they
have
been
captured
by
setting
a
trap
in
a
natural
enclosure
placing
a
fresh
bloody
bait
behind
the
trap
also
by
hanging
the
bait
about
five
feet
above

carefully
concealed
trap

are
most
commonly
hunted
by
the
aid
of
dogs

this
way
the
capture
is
a
comparatively
easy
matter
when
pursued
they
usually
take
to
a
tree
and
remain
there
until
the
arrival
of
the
hunter
when
a
rifle
bullet
ends
the
game
the
animal
will
take
to
a
tree
readily
for
any
dog
which
has
the
courage
to
follow
it
the
skin
of
the
mountain
lion
is
not
valuable
as
a
fur
and
is
used
principally
for
rugs
but
as
before
mentioned
many
of
the
states
pay
bounties
on
the
animals
so
that
hunting
them
may
be
made
a
profitable
business
in
certain
localities
the
tracks
of
this
animal
resemble
those
of
the
wild
cat
but
are
much
larger
the
footprints
will
measure
about
four
inches
in
diameter

chapter

the
wolverine
perhaps
the
most
rare
of
all
fur
bearing
animals
as
well
as
the
least
known
is
the
wolverine
this
animal
belongs
to
the
marten
family
and
is
the
largest
strongest
and
most
cunning
of
the
genus
in
fact
is
claimed
to
be
the
most
cunning
and
wary
of
all
the
furbearing
animals
and
among
the
trappers
has
an
unenviable
reputation
it
is
strictly
a
northern
animal
and
is
found
scattered
over
the
greater
portion
of
canada
and
alaska
ranging
southward
into
the
most
northern
portion
of
the
united
states
in
the
rocky
mountain
region
it
is
found
as
far
south
as
wyoming
they
are
not
plentiful
anywhere
and
are
probably
found
in
the
greatest
numbers
in
the
alaskan
interior
yukon
mackenzie
and
northern
british
columbia
while
the
wolverine
is
classed
among
the
martens
it
appears
to
be
the
connecting
link
between
the
martens
and
the
bears
for
it
is
stoutly
built
and
very
in
general
appearance
also
is
a
plantigrade
animal
walking
on
the
entire
sole
of
the
foot
an
average
specimen
will
measure
about
thirty
inches
from
the
end
of
the
nose
to
the
base
of
the
tail
the
tail
is
about
ten
inches
in
length
exclusive
of
the
long
hair
and
is
very
stumpy
and
bushy
the
fur
is
long
and
flowing
and
is
fairly
fine
the
general
color
is
a
dull
brown
with
black
legs
and
feet
and
a
black
patch
about
the
eyes
a
spot
or
stripe
of
lighter
color
sweeps
along
the
sides
the
teeth
are
large
and
strong
and
the
curved
claws
are
white
contrasting
sharply
with
the
black
fur
of
the
feet
and
legs
the
wolverine
makes
its
home
in
a
burrow
as
to
the
breeding
habits
of
the
animal
my
observations
have
been
limited
and
i
can
give
no
authentic
information
naturalists
disagree
as
to
the
number
of
young
and
the
time
of
birth
some
claim
that
the
young
animals
are
born
in
may
others
put
the
time
as
late
as
december
as
the
other
members
of
the
marten
family
give
birth
to
their
young
in
april
and
may
i
think
it
safe
to
assume
that
the
young
of
the
wolverine
are
born
about
the
same
time
and
that
the
number
would
be
from
three
to
five
in
a
litter
the
animal
is
a
great
traveler
straying
sometimes
thirty
miles
in
each
direction
from
its
home
it
is
not
a
rapid
traveler
however
and
it
is
claimed
that
a
man
can
easily
outrun
it
the
wolverine
is
also
known
under
other
fancy
names
the
most
common
of
which
is
carcajou
in
europe
it
is
called
the
glutton
from
its
supposed
gluttonous
appetite
among
the
indians
of
the
northwest
it
is
known
as
the
mountain
devil
and
in
british
columbia
is
sometimes
called
the
skunk
bear
the
animal
really
does
bear
some
resemblance
to
the
skunk
in
its
appearance
and
actions
the
most
noticeable
of
which
is
its
habits
of
raising
its
tail
when
disturbed
or
when
it
stops
to
listen
to
some
noise
sometimes
it
will
stand
on
its
hind
legs
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
some
object
which
has
aroused
its
interest
the
wolverine
is
not
as
active
as
the
other
members
of
the
genus
but
its
strength
and
cunning
fully
compensate
for
all
that
it
lacks
in
activity
it
can
seldom
capture
enough
of
game
to
satisfy
its
hunger
therefore
it
seeks
out
and
robs
the
caches
of
other
animals
also
robs
the
traps
of
their
bait
and
the
captured
animals
for
this
reason
the
animal
is
despised
and
dreaded
by
the
trapper
once
one
has
found
the
trap
line
it
will
follow
the
trail
to
the
end
destroying
the
sets
and
eating
the
baits
and
catch
what
it
can
not
eat
it
will
carry
away
and
conceal
presumably
for
future
use
it
will
also
sometimes
enter
the
trapper
cabin
and
destroy
or
defile
all
that
it
can
not
eat
many
strange
stories
are
told
of
the
animals
cunning
and
of
its
evil
ways
while
some
of
these
tales
are
no
doubt
true
i
feel
safe
in
saying
that
the
majority
have
no
foundation
whatever
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
wolverine
is
exceedingly
wary
and
that
it
is
a
great
mischief
maker
but
the
fact
that
the
animal
is
not
well
known
has
led
the
nature
writers
to
draw
on
their
imaginations
and
these
wonderful
stories
are
the
result
we
hear
of
the
animal
decoying
deer
to
its
hiding
place
by
dropping
a
bunch
of
moss
for
them
to
feed
on
and
then
springing
upon
the
unsuspecting
animal
from
a
nearby
limb
we
also
read
of
the
wolverine
biting
off
the
string
of
a
set
gun
without
discharging
the
arm
so
that
it
could
eat
the
bait
without
danger
that
such
stories
are
false
goes
without
saying
not
being
plentiful
in
any
one
locality
the
animals
are
seldom
trapped
and
what
few
are
caught
are
taken
when
they
are
visiting
camps
or
while
robbing
the
traps
of
the
bait
and
catch
trapping
them
at
all
times
is
difficult
work
owing
to
the
natural
wariness
of
the
animal
that
the
trap
must
be
well
concealed
and
that
the
animal
must
be
taken
when
off
its
guard
will
be
evident
to
all
the
no
trap
should
be
used
and
only
those
which
have
strong
springs
as
the
wolverine
possesses
great
strength
the
animals
are
not
sought
by
the
trapper
and
he
may
consider
himself
lucky
if
there
are
none
of
them
on
his
trapping
ground
when
they
are
found
the
trapper
aim
is
to
get
rid
of
them
and
the
most
certain
way
appears
to
be
by
means
of
poison
when
they
visit
the
traps
a
fair
portion
of
strychnine
placed
in
the
bait
will
usually
bring
the
desired
result

burrow
of
pocket
gopher
the
gopher
is
a
burrowing
animal
and
is
seldom
seen
above
ground
they
are
working
almost
all
of
the
time
during
the
spring
summer
and
fall
extending
the
burrows
in
search
of
food
they
also
work
in
winter
when
the
ground
is
not
frozen
and
it
is
supposed
that
they
also
work
under
the
frozen
ground
when
it
is
not
frozen
too
deep
they
are
most
active
in
the
fall
when
they
are
storing
up
food
for
winter
the
burrows
will
be
found
from
six
to
twelve
inches
beneath
the
surface
of
the
ground
the
usual
depth
being
about
eight
inches
at
irregular
distances
along
the
burrow
the
animal
makes
a
short
branch
passage
leading
up
to
the
surface
where
it
deposits
the
dirt
dug
from
the
main
passage
in
the
form
of
a
mound
after
the
dirt
is
all
thrown
out
it
closes
the
branch
passage
packing
the
ground
in
solidly
so
that
the
only
visible
signs
of
the
burrow
are
the
mounds
of
ground
there
is
a
good
reason
why
the
animal
should
be
so
careful
to
keep
the
passage
closed
for
they
have
a
number
of
enemies
besides
man
its
most
dangerous
enemies
are
perhaps
the
little
spotted
skunk
or
civet
cat
and
the
bull
snake
as
both
of
these
creatures
once
they
get
inside
of
the
burrow
follow
its
course
until
they
find
their
victim
the
food
of
the
gopher
consists
mostly
of
roots
of
plants
but
they
often
cut
the
roots
of
fruit
trees
they
are
particularly
destructive
to
alfalfa
and
the
loss
to
farmers
caused
by
these
animals
is
considerable
not
only
from
the
plants
destroyed
by
having
the
roots
cut
but
also
from
the
plants
buried
under
the
mounds
and
from
the
fact
that
the
mounds
interfere
with
the
cutting
of
the
crop
the
fur
is
of
no
value
but
owing
to
the
destructiveness
of
the
animals
land
owners
are
very
anxious
to
be
rid
of
them
in
many
places
a
bounty
is
paid
on
the
gopher
so
that
they
may
be
profitably
trapped
when
animals
are
of
no
value
the
traps
recommended
for
the
gopher
are
the
no
steel
trap
and
some
of
the
various
choker
traps
made
especially
for
this
use
in
setting
steel
traps
select
the
freshest
mound
and
by
examining
closely
one
can
usually
tell
which
way
the
dirt
was
thrown
out
and
will
know
on
which
side
to
look
for
the
burrow
a
handy
tool
is
a
slender
pointed
iron
rod
to
use
as
a
probe
in
searching
for
the
burrow
having
located
the
passage
open
it
up
and
set
the
trap
on
the
bottom
sinking
it
down
until
level
cover
it
lightly
with
dirt
and
close
the
hole
by
laying
a
small
piece
of
board
or
a
shingle
over
the
opening
covering
with
ground
the
trap
should
be
fastened
with
a
stick
and
the
same
stick
will
serve
as
a
marker
so
that
one
can
easily
find
the
trap
a
small
spade
or
a
heavy
garden
trowel
will
be
needed
for
digging
and
for
convenience
the
traps
stakes
may
be
carried
in
a
large
basket
the
regular
gopher
traps
mentioned
above
are
more
easily
set
than
steel
traps
and
printed
directions
for
setting
usually
accompany
the
traps
they
should
be
set
at
one
side
of
the
burrow
on
a
level
with
the
bottom
and
with
the
mouth
of
the
trap
just
even
with
the
side
of
the
passage
just
a
little
light
should
be
allowed
to
penetrate
from
behind
and
all
other
parts
should
be
closed
so
as
to
exclude
light
the
gopher
in
coming
along
the
passage
sees
the
light
and
goes
to
investigate
when
it
will
be
caught
in
the
trap
if
too
much
light
shows
up
he
does
not
go
close
to
look
at
it
but
immediately
brings
a
load
of
dirt
and
proceeds
to
close
the
hole
thus
burying
the
trap
all
loose
dirt
should
be
removed
from
the
burrow
before
setting
the
trap
as
otherwise
the
gopher
will
gather
up
the
dirt
as
it
approaches
the
light
and
shove
it
into

the

by

and
also
as
bait
for

and
it
is
well
for
the
trapper
to
know
something
about
the
animal
and
how
to
capture
it
properly
speaking
there
are
no
rabbits
in
north
america
the
animals
known
by
that
name
being
classed
by
naturalists
as
hares
but
the
name
is
so
universally
used
that
it
would
be
useless
now
to
try
to
bring
the
true
name
into
general
use
there
are
many
species
one
or
more
of
which
will
be
found
in
almost
every
locality
of
north
america
but
the
most
important
species
are
the
common
cottontail
the
jack
rabbit
and
the
snowshoe
rabbit
or
varying
hare
of
these
there
are
many
varieties
but
they
are
so
similar
in
appearance
and
habits
that
i
do
not
consider
it
necessary
or
advisable
to
go
into
detail
in
describing
them
in
a
work
of
this
kind
rabbits
belong
to
the
class
known
as
rodents
or
gnawing
animals
and
are
distinctly
different
in
structure
from
all
other
animals
of
the
class
the
long
hind
legs
long
ears
small
tail
and
soft
fur
is
characteristic
of
the
genus
the
common
cottontail
is
found
in
almost
all
parts
of
the
united
states
in
certain
parts
of
the
north
only
being
replaced
by
the
snowshoe
rabbit
they
are
smaller
than
the
snowshoe
and
jack
rabbits
and
are
of
a
grayish
brown
on
the
back
and
sides
shading
to
white
on
the
under
parts
the
fur
is
a
reddish
brown
in
summer
their
food
consists
of
grasses
fruits
and
vegetables
bark
and
the
leaves
of
evergreen
shrubs
such
as
the
laurel
they
are
especially
fond
of
fruits
sweet
apples
being
a
favorite
food
and
are
also
partial
to
cabbage
their
favorite
haunts
are
the
brushy
wooded
bottom
lands
but
they
are
also
found
on
the
hills
and
mountains
in
fact
in
almost
any
place
where
they
can
find
food
and
shelter
the
snowshoe
rabbit
replaces
the
cottontail
in
canada
and
the
most
northern
portions
of
the
united
states
as
before
mentioned
they
are
larger
than
the
common
rabbits
and
like
the
northern
weasel
the
color
of
their
fur
varies
with
the
seasons
the
summer
coat
is
a
reddish
brown
but
when
the
cold
weather
comes
on
in
the
fall
they
commence
to
take
on
a
white
color
the
fur
of
the
ears
and
legs
being
the
first
to
change
and
in
a
few
weeks
the
animal
will
be
perfectly
white
this
is
nature
provision
for
the
animal
protection
and
their
color
in
winter
is
so
nearly
like
that
of
the
snow
that
when
sitting
under
some
log
or
clump
of
brush
they
are
almost
invisible
they
have
many
enemies
being
preyed
upon
by
all
the
carnivorous
animals
also
by
such
birds
as
the
hawk
and
owl
but
as
they
are
exceedingly
prolific
their
numbers
increase
rapidly
every
few
years
perhaps
at
regular
intervals
but
of
that
i
am
not
certain
some
disease
makes
its
appearance
among
them
and
they
die
off
rapidly
some
naturalists
believe
that
this
is
caused
by
inbreeding
as
the
rabbit
circle
of
acquaintance
is
comparatively
small
and
his
knowledge
of
the
country
and
the
ground
covered
by
his
wanderings
is
limited
to
a
very
small
area
the
food
of
the
snowshoe
rabbit
consists
mainly
of
grasses
in
summer
and
the
bark
of
certain
young
growths
in
winter
they
are
very
fond
of
salt
and
wherever
there
is
a
trace
of
it
to
be
found
they
will
come
nightly
and
dig
up
the
soil
in
order
to
procure
it
the
northern
settlers
who
use
large
numbers
of
these
animals
for
food
sometimes
make
a
salt
lick
for
the
rabbits
and
watch
for
the
animals
in
the
early
evening
the
feet
of
the
snowshoe
rabbit
are
very
large
and
are
heavily
furred
forming
a
sort
of
snowshoe
which
accounts
for
its
common
name
they
are
very
methodical
running
the
same
route
so
often
as
to
form
a
well
defined
trail
quite
common
in
the
northern
swamps
and
hazel
thickets
these
trails
are
followed
after
the
snow
falls
and
become
beaten
several
inches
in
depth
it
is
from
the
skins
of
the
snowshoe
rabbit
that
the
northern
indians
make
the
wonderful
rabbit
skin
blankets
the
skin
is
ripped
down
the
back
of
the
hind
legs
and
is
drawn
off
whole
and
while
still
fresh
is
cut
into
one
long
strip
averaging
an
inch
in
width
immediately
after
cutting
the
strip
rolls
up
leaving
the
outside
covered
with
fur
and
resembling
a
fur
rope
these
skins
are
wound
into
a
ball
and
kept
frozen
until
the
desired
number
has
been
secured
when
they
are
woven
into
a
frame
the
ends
being
sewed
together
it
makes
the
warmest
bed
covering
known
and
is
used
universally
by
the
northern
trappers
it
also
was
a
great
comfort
to
those
who
went
into
alaska
and
yukon

rabbit
snares
the
jack
rabbit
is
found
mostly
on
the
western
plains
and
is
the
largest
of
the
american
hares
they
resemble
the
ordinary
rabbit
in
structure
but
the
ears
are
very
long
and
the
tail
is
more
like
that
of
the
deer
in
running
they
make
long
leaps
all
four
feet
hanging
straight
down
presenting
a
singular
appearance
rabbits
are
seldom
trapped
with
steel
traps
but
almost
every
country
boy
knows
how
to
take
them
in
box
traps
baited
with
sweet
apples
the
cottontail
may
also
be
taken
in
a
spring
pole
snare
such
as
shown
in
the
cut
the
noose
is
made
of
twine
and
is
about
ten
inches
in
diameter
when
carefully
made
they
are
almost
certain
in
action
they
should
be
baited
with
sweet
apple
or
cabbage
the
snare
used
for
the
snowshoe
rabbit
is
a
very
simple
contrivance
the
white
trappers
use
no
brass
wire
doubled
and
twisted
with
a
small
loop
on
one
end
and
made
into
the
form
of
a
slip
noose
the
snares
are
set
on
the
trails
the
bottom
of
the
noose
being
about
four
inches
above
the
trail
and
the
loop
about
four
inches
in
diameter
is
attached
firmly
to
a
brush
placed
horizontally
over
the
path
a
short
stick
is
set
upright
under
the
noose
and
others
are
placed
on
either
side
of
the
snare
when
properly
arranged
the
noose
will
take
the
animal
by
the
neck
when
it
attempts
to
leap
through
and
it
will
be
choked
by
its
struggles
the
indians
make
the
snares
of
light
linen
cord
but
with
the
white
man
this
method
is
a
failure
as
the
rabbit
will
invariably
stop
and
bite
the
cord
i
do
not
understand
why
they
do
not
bite
the
snares
set
by
the
indians
where
tracks
are
plentiful
and
good
trails
can
not
be
found
i
have
caught
them
by
placing
a
few
fresh
twigs
of
birch
or
tamarack
on
each
side
of
the
snare
the
rabbit
is
certain
to
find
them
and
after
eating
those
placed
on
one
side
it
will
attempt
to
leap
through
the
noose
to
reach
the
others
which
of
course
is
the
end
of
poor
bunny
the
smallest
and
tenderest
shoots
should
be
selected
for
bait
and
only
two
or
three
should
be
placed
at
a
snare
at
other
times
i
have
made
a
fence
of
small
evergreen
trees
where
signs
of
the
animals
were
numerous
and
have
fixed
snares
in
the
openings
along
the
obstruction
this
is
also
a
successful
method
i
have
never
learned
of
any
method
of
trapping
or
snaring
the
jack
rabbit
but
believe
they
could
be
trapped
successfully
where
they
visit
the
farms
and
gnaw
the
bark
from
fruit
trees
as
they
do
in
some
parts
of
the
west

tracks
and
signs
old
and
experienced
trappers
can
read
the
signs
of
the
forest
and
stream
with
a
degree
of
accuracy
that
to
the
amateur
is
surprising
in
this
way
he
can
make
a
fair
estimate
of
the
number
and
kinds
of
animals
found
in
a
locality
while
the
novice
would
see
nothing
or
if
he
did
see
the
tracks
and
signs
he
would
not
be
able
to
distinguish
them
one
from
another
to
be
able
to
read
the
signs
accurately
is
essential
for
successful
hunting
and
trapping
the
expert
trapper
will
know
instantly
on
seeing
a
track
just
what
animal
it
was
that
passed
that
way
and
by
knowing
its
habits
will
know
about
when
it
is
likely
to
return
and
how
to
place
a
trap
for
its
capture
he
can
also
tell
with
fair
accuracy
at
what
time
the
animal
passed
that
way
and
frequently
will
know
whether
it
was
a
male
or
female
whether
it
was
looking
for
food
or
a
place
of
rest
whether
it
was
on
its
regular
route
of
travel
and
where
it
was
going
to
the
novice
all
of
these
signs
are
unintelligible
the
art
of
sign
reading
can
be
learned
only
from
experience
while
the
writer
can
distinguish
the
signs
and
tracks
of
the
animals
to
put
this
knowledge
in
print
is
exceedingly
difficult
however
i
will
endeavor
here
to
describe
the
tracks
of
the
and
game
animals
and
believe
that
the
description
will
be
of
value
to
the
amateur
before
the
coming
of
the
snow
and
the
myriads
of
tracks
which
then
appear
the
stream
with
its
muddy
or
sandy
shores
is
per
haps
the
most
promising
place
in
which
to
look
for
signs
in
the
mud
alongside
of
a
pool
of
water
the
tracks
of
that
busy
little
animal
the
muskrat
can
be
seen
the
trail
of
this
animal
is
accurately
shown
in
the
drawing
when
seen
at
the
water
edge
and
only
a
few
tracks
are
visible
the
trail
appears
irregular
but
if
one
can
see
where
it
has
walked
for
some
distance
it
will
be
noted
that
the
animal
has
a
regular
step
some
five
or
six
inches
in
length
and
there
is
also
the
trail
of
the
dragging
tail
most
plainly
seen
in
the
soft
muddy
bottom
of
the
still
shallow
water
in
the
snow
the
track
will
appear
the
same
only
the
prints
of
the
hind
feet
are
visible
the
front
feet
being
very
much
smaller
and
the
print
being
obliterated
by
those
of
the
hind
feet
when
the
animal
is
running
the
prints
of
all
four
feet
are
readily
discernible
the
print
of
the
hind
foot
will
measure
about
two
and
a
fourth
inches
in
length
if
the
full
impression
of
the
foot
is
to
be
seen
illustration
tracks
of
furbearing
animals
in
addition
to
the
tracks
other
signs
may
be
seen
where
the
animals
are
found
in
fair
numbers
they
will
have
well
defined
trails
leading
from
the
water
where
the
bank
is
steep
the
trails
are
sometimes
worn
an
inch
or
more
in
depth
owing
to
the
muskrat
habit
of
sliding
down
the
bank
which
habit
is
not
practiced
in
play
but
for
convenience
other
signs
are
the
droppings
on
the
logs
which
extend
into
the
water
the
dens
with
an
accumulation
of
grass
at
the
entrance
also
the
scratch
signs
on
the
bank
the
feed
beds
houses
etc
all
signs
are
plentiful
in
early
fall
and
at
such
times
the
novice
is
likely
to
overestimate
the
number
of
animals
as
the
muskrat
is
very
active
at
that
season
the
signs
of
the
beaver
are
very
similar
to
those
of
the
muskrat
but
the
tracks
are
much
larger
and
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
level
of
the
water
in
the
vicinity
of
a
beaver
lodge
is
raised
far
above
the
muddy
shores
by
the
dam
the
tracks
are
seldom
seen
however
the
house
and
dam
with
the
fresh
cut
wood
and
well
used
trails
are
all
of
the
signs
that
are
needed
old
houses
and
dams
are
found
frequently
but
if
there
is
no
fresh
cutting
about
one
may
be
certain
that
the
house
is
uninhabited
one
of
the
most
puzzling
things
to
the
novice
is
to
know
the
number
of
inmates
that
is
whether
or
not
it
is
a
full
family
but
methods
of
determining
this
are
given
in
the
chapter
dealing
with
this
animal
in
the
north
the
beavers
are
ice
bound
during
the
winter
months
but
occasionally
one
may
find
them
emerging
from
the
water
at
some
springhole
near
the
lodge
or
dam
and
at
such
times
the
tracks
may
be
seen
in
the
snow
the
trail
of
the
otter
is
unmistakable
owing
to
its
peculiar
floundering
sliding
mode
of
travel
it
is
seldom
seen
except
in
the
near
vicinity
of
the
water
in
the
snow
the
track
is
well
defined
and
resembles
the
trail
made
by
dragging
a
small
log
the
footprints
in
the
bottom
of
the
trail
being
very
distinct
the
length
of
jump
is
from
four
to
eight
feet
depending
on
the
condition
of
the
snow
and
the
footprints
will
measure
about
two
inches
in
diameter
they
travel
under
the
ice
whenever
possible
and
one
may
see
frequently
where
the
otter
has
bored
into
a
snow
bank
at
the
edge
trying
to
locate
a
weak
spot
in
the
ice
when
they
have
been
working
under
the
ice
for
some
time
one
may
find
where
they
have
been
entering
at
and
emerging
from
the
spring
holes
near
the
shore
at
such
places
the
snow
will
be
packed
down
solidly
and
remains
of
fish
may
be
found
when
there
is
no
snow
one
may
learn
of
the
most
frequented
localities
by
the
number
of
slides
and
landing
places
at
the
landing
places
the
droppings
will
be
found
and
they
may
be
distinguished
from
those
of
other
animals
from
the
large
proportions
of
fish
bones
and
scales
another
animal
which
will
be
found
frequenting
the
waterways
is
the
mink
the
track
of
this
little
animal
may
be
found
along
the
muddy
shore
where
the
steep
bank
crowds
it
down
to
the
water
edge
at
other
times
it
will
travel
several
rods
from
the
water
and
after
he
ice
forms
will
run
on
the
ice
seldom
going
far
from
the
shore
its
method
of
travel
is
an
easy
lope
and
the
footprints
are
nearly
always
in
pairs
about
three
inches
apart
one
somewhat
in
advance
of
the
other
and
separated
by
a
distance
of
from
one
to
two
feet
the
footprints
measure
from
one
to
one
and
inches
in
length
they
are
sometimes
found
entering
the
water
at
spring
holes
in
the
ice
and
at
open
places
in
the
rapids
about
the
outlets
or
inlets
of
lakes
and
ponds
and
at
the
or
drifts
on
the
stream
one
may
sometimes
find
small
slender
pointed
droppings
on
the
stones
or
logs
these
sign
will
show
unmistakably
that
the
route
is
regularly
used
by
at
least
one
mink
the
track
of
the
weasel
is
similar
to
that
of
the
mink
but
is
smaller
but
as
the
weasel
is
not
a
water
animal
its
tracks
are
more
likely
to
be
seen
along
the
fences
and
where
logs
and
rocks
are
plentiful
here
the
trail
will
be
found
leading
here
and
there
in
an
aimless
sort
of
way
and
entering
every
nook
and
corner
where
the
persistent
little
hunter
thinks
it
may
find
a
sleepy
bunny
or
some
other
animal
or
bird
the
length
of
jump
is
from
sixteen
to
twenty
inches
and
the
footprints
measure
about
one
or
one
and
a
fourth
inches
in
length
the
marten
has
a
similar
method
of
travel
and
makes
a
track
like
those
of
the
mink
and
weasel
being
a
little
larger
than
the
track
of
the
mink
and
the
footprint
is
broader
and
more
rounded
the
foot
being
heavily
furred
the
toes
do
not
show
so
distinctly
the
trail
will
be
found
leading
through
the
gullies
and
depressions
of
the
heavily
timbered
places
and
occasionally
they
also
travel
on
the
ridges
few
signs
are
seen
when
the
ground
is
bare
but
in
the
dark
sheltered
ravines
the
droppings
may
sometimes
be
seen
on
the
logs
resembling
those
of
the
mink
but
somewhat
larger
sometimes
one
may
also
find
where
they
have
killed
a
bird
or
rabbit

tracks
of
furbearing
animals
there
is
practically
no
difference
between
the
track
of
the
fisher
and
that
of
the
marten
except
in
size
the
footprints
of
the
fisher
are
perhaps
a
trifle
more
distinct
and
will
measure
from
two
to
two
and
a
half
inches
in
length
the
distance
between
each
set
of
tracks
being
from
two
and
a
half
to
four
feet
the
tracks
of
both
the
marten
and
the
fisher
are
found
in
the
same
kind
of
places
but
the
fisher
is
more
of
a
rambler
and
more
given
to
rambling
in
the
open
country
when
the
ground
is
bare
one
may
see
occasionally
where
they
have
killed
and
eaten
rabbits
in
which
case
very
little
will
remain
except
the
fur
and
toes
of
the
victim
although
the
skunk
is
a
member
of
the
great
weasel
family
its
method
of
travel
is
decidedly
different
from
that
of
the
weasel
for
it
seldom
lopes
but
has
a
slow
measured
walk
the
length
of
step
is
about
five
or
six
inches
and
the
footprints
are
from
one
to
one
and
inches
in
length
the
trail
is
rather
broad
and
if
the
snow
is
deep
and
soft
the
animal
sinks
deeply
so
as
to
make
a
trail
with
its
body
however
the
skunk
seldom
travels
when
the
snow
is
in
that
condition
signs
of
the
skunk
may
be
noted
also
in
summer
and
early
fall
occasionally
one
will
find
in
the
field
small
excavations
varying
from
an
inch
and
a
half
to
four
or
five
inches
in
depth
nicely
rounded
and
funnel
shaped
this
is
the
work
of
the
skunk
and
it
was
hunting
for
insects
or
grubs
the
most
conspicuous
signs
however
are
the
dens
which
may
be
found
along
the
steep
gravelly
hillsides
although
the
woodchuck
makes
a
similar
den
one
may
be
able
to
distinguish
them
as
a
rule
if
the
den
is
inhabited
by
skunks
one
will
usually
find
black
and
white
hairs
clinging
to
the
mouth
of
the
den
also
will
be
likely
to
find
a
pile
of
droppings
somewhere
near
and
to
one
side
of
the
entrance
the
walk
of
the
opossum
is
similar
to
that
of
the
skunk
but
the
trail
is
broader
the
footprints
more
spreading
and
the
toes
turned
outward
the
feet
being
naked
the
toes
show
very
plainly
their
tracks
are
only
seen
after
a
warm
night
when
the
snow
is
melting
and
the
dens
are
seldom
found
unless
one
can
follow
the
trail
the
footprints
will
measure
from
one
and
a
fourth
to
two
and
a
half
inches
in
diameter
the
tracks
made
by
the
animals
of
the
dog
family
the
fox
coyote
and
wolf
are
all
similar
practically
the
only
difference
being
in
size
the
foxes
make
the
smallest
tracks
that
of
the
red
fox
being
about
two
or
two
and
a
fourth
inches
in
length
and
the
length
of
step
is
about
fourteen
inches
the
female
makes
a
narrower
track
than
the
male
the
same
being
true
of
many
animals
there
is
no
difference
in
the
tracks
of
the
silver
cross
and
red
foxes
they
being
all
of
the
same
variety
but
the
gray
fox
makes
a
shorter
and
rounder
track
easily
distinguished
from
that
of
the
red
fox
in
early
fall
one
may
see
the
droppings
of
the
fox
along
the
old
wood
roads
and
stock
paths
and
they
may
be
distinguished
from
those
of
the
dog
by
the
remains
of
apples
and
other
fruits
which
are
found
there
occasionally
one
may
see
the
tracks
in
the
mud
or
dust
of
the
old
roads
in
the
woods
and
sometimes
the
dens
are
to
be
found
as
before
mentioned
the
track
of
the
coyote
is
identical
with
that
of
the
red
fox
except
that
it
is
larger
the
length
of
step
is
about
sixteen
inches
and
the
track
will
measure
about
two
and
inches
in
length
by
two
inches
in

the
track
of
the
timber
wolf
is
larger
that
of
a
full
grown
specimen
measuring
about
three
inches
in
width
by
four
in

the
length
of

being
about
eighteen

as
will
be
noted
that
of

the
lynx
makes
a
step

and
the
footprint
of
a
large
one
will
be
from
three
to
three
and
a

the
cougar
makes
a
larger
track
than
the
lynx
otherwise
there
is
no
difference
occasionally
one
may
find
where
these
animals
have
killed
game
the
lynx
will
eat
all
but
the
feet
of
a
rabbit
the
droppings
may
also
be
seen
at
times
they
resemble
somewhat
those
of
the
fox
but
are
slightly
larger
and
never
show
remains
of
fruit
as
the
lynx
never
eats
vegetable
food
along
the
streams
and
shores
of
the
lakes
and
ponds
one
may
see
in
summer
and
early
fall
the
tracks
of
the
raccoon
where
the
animal
has
traveled
the
strip
of
mud
at
the
water
edge
looking
for
frogs
and
fish
one
may
trace
the
animal
along
the
stream
and
will
find
that
at
times
it
has
waded
in
the
shallow
water
and
then
again
has
gone
the
lope
along
the
water
edge
or
perhaps
has
made
a
side
journey
to
some
cornfield
at
such
places
if
coons
are
plentiful
one
may
find
a
trail
leading
through
the
fence
into
a
field
in
parts
of
the
south
where
these
animals
are
abundant
trails
may
also
be
found
along
the
ponds
and
swamps
the
coon
belongs
to
the
bear
family
and
like
the
bear
steps
on
nearly
the
entire
bottom
of
the
foot
instead
of
the
toes
only
as
do
the
cats
and
some
other
animals
therefore
the
footprint
is
usually
long
and
narrow
and
the
foot
being
bare
on
the
bottom
the
long
slender
toes
show
up
distinctively
the
animal
has
the
loping
method
of
travel
like
the
mink
and
weasel
but
shows
the
print
of
a
hind
foot
beside
that
of
the
front
foot
the
right
and
left
alternating
the
prints
of
the
hind
foot
will
measure
from
three
to
four
inches
in
length
when
the
entire
track
is
visible
one
is
not
likely
to
mistake
the
track
of
the
bear
as
it
is
the
largest
of
the
furbearing
animals
as
far
north
as
pennsylvania
its
tracks
will
occasionally
be
seen
in
the
snow
but
north
of
that
tier
of
states
the
bears
seldom
move
about
after
the
coming
of
snow
the
tracks
may
sometimes
be
seen
in
the
mud
and
wet
moss
of
the
northern
swamps
also
on
the
shores
of
the
lakes
and
along
the
streams
the
bear
has
a
shuffling
mode
of
walking
and
turns
its
toes
outward
it
is
fond
of
walking
on
logs
and
will
do
so
frequently
where
fallen
timber
is
plentiful
the
track
of
a
large
black
bear
will
sometimes
measure
eight
inches
in

and
that
of

those
most
noticeable

the
marked
trails
which
are
mentioned
in
the
chapter
describing
this
animal
while
the
deer
are
not
classed
among
the
animals
they
are
interesting
to
all
trappers
and
i
have
shown
drawings
of
the
footprints
of
the
common
deer
the
moose
the
caribou
and
the
three
most
common
species
of
rabbits
namely
the
common
cottontail
the
snowshoe
rabbit
or
varying
hare
and
the
jack
rabbit
the
tracks
shown
in
size
are
of
the
cottontail
as
will
be
noted
in
the
drawings
of
the
deer
tracks
that
of
the
hind
foot
is
narrower
and
more
pointed
than
that
of
the
front
the
doe
also
makes
a
smaller
and
more
slender
track
the
average
track
will
measure
about
two
and
a
fourth
inches
in
length
the
moose
makes
a
similar
track
but
it
is
much
larger
and
will
measure
about
four
and
a
half
to
five
and
a
half
inches
the
track
of
the
caribou
will
average
somewhat
smaller
than
that
of
the
moose
and
is
of
decidedly
different
shape
it
is
not
so
pointed
and
the
hoof
being
split
much
higher
it
spreads
out
more
also
the
prints
of
the
two
small
toes
on
the
back
of
the
foot
are
to
be
seen
in
nearly
all
cases
while
the
moose
does
not
always
show
them
almost
everybody
is
familiar
with
the
track
of
the
rabbit
but
i
have
shown
those
of
the
three
species
mentioned
mainly
to
show
the
difference
in
size
the
feet
being
furred
heavily
the
prints
of
the
toes
seldom
show
except
on
hard
snow
some
of
these
tracks
were
drawn
from
memory
but
others
were
sketched
from
the
actual
trails
on
the
whole
i
think
they
will
be
found
to
be
accurate
at
least
near
enough
to
enable
anybody
to
distinguish
the
trails
of
the
various
animals
and
i
think
that
the
descriptions
and
illustrations
will
be
of
value
to
the
amateur
trapper
when
looking
over
his
territory
and
locating
the
runways
of
the
animals
that
he
proposes
to
catch
chapter
xxiii
handling
furs
to
know
the
habits
and
the
nature
of
the
various
animals
and
to
know
how
to
catch
them
is
not
all
that
is
essential
for
success
but
the
trapper
must
also
know
how
to
skin
the
various
animals
and
how
to
cure
the
skins
and
prepare
them
for
market
the
loss
caused
the
trapper
by
the
lack
of
this
knowledge
is
considerable
many
skins
because
they
have
not
been
fully
cured
reach
the
dealer
in
a
tainted
condition
others
are
not
fully
stretched
and
are
graded
small
and
some
do
not
have
the
proper
shape
some
are
not
cleaned
of
flesh
and
fat
do
not
have
the
tail
bone
removed
have
not
been
kept
clean
or
have
been
badly
damaged
in
killing
or
skinning
all
of
which
has
a
tendency
to
decrease
their
value
i
have
seen
the
skins
of
raccoon
killed
before
they
were
prime
and
stretched
on
the
side
of
a
barn
where
the
glare
of
the
sun
burned
the
life
out
of
the
skins
rendering
them
worthless
i
have
also
seen
skunk
and
mink
skins
drawn
over
the
end
of
a
thick
board
roughly
fashioned
with
an
axe
and
hung
up
by
the
nose
the
weight
of
the
board
drawing
the
head
out
until
it
resembled
the
finger
of
a
glove
the
trapper
who
handles
his
catch
in
that
way
can
never
expect
to
receive
full
value
for
his
furs
there
are
two
ways
of
skinning
animals
namely
casing
and
skinning
open
the
weasel
mink
marten
fisher
fox
opossum
muskrat
civet
skunk
wild
cat
should
be
cased
the
raccoon
bear
beaver
badger
cougar
wolf
wolverine
and
coyote
should
be
skinned
open
some
dealers
prefer
to
have
southern
raccoons
cased
to
remove
a
skin
by
the
first
mentioned
plan
cut
it
loose
around
the
feet
and
rip
down
the
back
of
the
hind
legs
to
and
around
the
vent
peel
the
skin
carefully
from
the
hind
legs
and
skin
the
tail
by
slipping
a
split
stick
over
the
bone
when
by
gripping
the
stick
with
the
right
hand
with
the
bone
of
the
tail
between
the
second
and
third
fingers
and
holding
the
animal
with
the
left
hand
the
skin
may
be
stripped
off
easily
draw
the
skin
downward
from
the
body
keeping
it
as
clean
of
flesh
and
fat
as
possible
to
facilitate
this
process
the
animal
may
be
suspended
from
the
limb
of
a
tree
or
other
projection
by
looping
a
strong
cord
around
the
hind
legs
after
they
have
been
skinned
the
skin
should
be
drawn
from
the
front
legs
and
when
the
ears
are
reached
they
should
be
cut
off
cutting
downwards
towards
the
head
the
skin
should
be
cut
loose
about
the
eyes
and
nose
and
it
will
then
be
in
the
form
of
a
long
pocket
fur
side
in
the
weasel
mink
marten
fisher
fox
skunk
civet
cat
and
wild
cat
should
be
skinned
in
this
way
the
otter
must
have
the
tail
ripped
open
its
entire
length
on
the
underside
and
as
they
are
a
difficult
animal
to
flesh
it
is
best
to
skin
them
clean
with
a
knife
leaving
no
flesh
or
fat
adhering
to
the
skin
the
muskrat
and
opossum
should
also
be
cased
but
as
the
tails
of
these
animals
have
no
fur
they
should
not
be
skinned
the
skin
being
cut
loose
about
the
base
or
where
the
fur
ends
some
trappers
do
not
use
much
care
in
removing
the
skin
from
the
head
of
the
muskrat
but
simply
pull
it
off
by
main
strength
this
leaves
the
flesh
of
the
head
remaining
on
the
skin
and
a
collection
of
such
skins
will
usually
be
graded
low
and
the
skins
will
average
a
few
cents
less
than
when
properly
handled
to
skin
an
animal
open
rip
the
skin
on
the
belly
from
the
point
of
the
lower
jaw
to
the
vent
down
the
back
of
the
hind
legs
and
on
the
inside
of
the
front
legs
across
the
breast
to
the
point
of
the
brisket
animals
that
are
intended
only
as
furs
may
have
the
feet
cut
off
but
bears
mountain
lions
wolves
and
wolverines
should
have
the
feet
skinned
out
to
the
ends
of
the
toes
leaving
the
claws
attached
to
the
skin
this
increases
their
value
for
mounting
or
for
rugs
the
skin
should
be
peeled
from
the
body
using
the
knife
whenever
necessary
in
skinning
the
beaver
rip
the
skin
from
the
point
of
the
chin
to
the
vent
and
around
the
base
of
the
tail
and
cut
off
the
feet
but
do
not
rip
the
skin
of
the
legs
skin
the
animal
perfectly
clean
using
the
knife
everywhere
as
it
is
almost
impossible
to
flesh
a
beaver
after
skinning
not
a
particle
of
flesh
or
fat
should
be
allowed
to
remain
on
the
skin

a
good
supply
of
stretching
boards
of
various
sizes
should
be
made
in
advance
of
the
trapping
season
soft
pine
poplar
basswood
or
cedar
boards
are
best
and
old
dry
goods
boxes
make
excellent
stretching
boards
they
should
be
free
of
knots
and
should
be
planed
smooth
so
that
the
furs
may
be
removed
easily
after
they
are
dry
for
mink
the
boards
should
be
from
to
inches
in
length
and
from
to
inches
wide
at
widest
part
and
about
inch
narrower
at
the
shoulders
from
which
point
it
should
taper
gracefully
to
the
head
and
end
with
a
rounded
point
for
marten
the
boards
should
be
a
trifle
wider
for
the
average
fox
or
fisher
the
board
should
be
feet
long
about
inches
wide
at
the
shoulder
and
at
the
base
for
the
otter
the
board
should
be
about
inch

lynx
will
require
a
board
about
inches
wide
at
the
shoulder
and
inches
at
the
base
by
about
feet
in
length
for
large
muskrats
the
board
should
be
two
feet
long

the
base
inches
narrower
at
the
shoulder
and
with
a
flat
iron
shaped
head

nose
one
should
have

the
boards
should
be
about
inches
wide
at

these
dimensions
are
for
the
average
animals
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
sizes
vary
greatly
in
the
various
parts
of
the
country
in

especially
there
is
a
great

illustration
canadian
pattern
stretching
boards
for
convenience
and
good
results
i
advise
ripping
with
a
saw
a
narrow
wedge
from
the
center
of
all
boards
except
those
intended
for
muskrats
in
this
way
one
can
stretch
the
skins
to
their
full
size
and
they
may
be
more
easily
removed
from
the
boards
after
the
wedge
is
withdrawn
for
large
boards
to
be
used
for
lynx
otter
and
animals
of
a
similar
size
i
fasten
two
short
strips
to
the
base
of
one
piece
of
the
board
as
shown
in
the
cut
this
stiffens
the
stretcher
and
prevents
the
pieces
from
turning
in
the
skin
all
boards
should
be
beveled
on
the
sides
leaving
the
edges
thin
round
and
smooth
the
boards
shown
are
of
the
canadian
pattern
used
universally
by
the
canadian
trappers
both
indian
and
white
and
recommended
and
approved
of
by
such
large
dealers
as
the
hudson
bay
co
the
tendency
among
trappers
of
more
southern
districts
is
to
use
a
less
tapered
board
with
a
more
rounded
point
the
skins
should
be
stretched
as
soon
as
they
are
fleshed
in
using
the
three
piece
board
slip
the
two
halves
into
the
skin
the
flesh
side
being
out
and
fasten
the
hind
legs
with
one
or
two
small
nails
in
each
then
insert
the
wedge
and
draw
down
all
slack
parts
and
fasten
with
nails
be
sure
to
get
the
back
on
one
side
of
the
board
and
the
belly
on
the
other
draw
up
the
skin
of
the
lower
jaw
and
fasten
with
a
couple
of
tacks
or
small
nails
in
the
case
of
the
lynx
it
is
advisable
to
slip
a
narrow
board
into
each
front
leg
and
a
small
incision
should
be
made
in
the
tip
of
the
tail
of
all
animals
to
allow
the
moisture
to
drain
out
and
the
tail
to
dry
the
tail
of
the
otter
should
be
stretched
out
to
its
full
width
and
well
fastened
with
small
nails
some
trappers
also
split
the
tail
of
the
skunk
for
about
of
its
length
and
fasten
it
in
the
same
way
the
proper
way
to
stretch
open
skins
is
by
lacing
them
with
twine
in
a
hoop
or
frame
the
beaver
should
be
stretched
round
and
a
hoop
is
most
convenient
my
method
is
to
fasten
the
skin
in
the
hoop
at
four
points
and
then
with
a
large
sacking
needle
and
strong
twine
stretch
out
one
quarter
at
a
time
i
use
a
separate
twine
for
each
quarter
sewing
thru
the
edge
of
the
skin
and
around
the
hoop
tying
the
end
with
a
loose
knot
in
case
i
find
that
any
part
is
stretched
too
much
or
not
enough
it
is
a
simple
matter
to
untie
the
string
and
give
it
a
little
slack
or
take
up
a
little
as
the
case
requires
the
raccoon
should
be
stretched
nearly
square
and
all
other
skins
to
their
natural
shape
a
square
frame
is
most
convenient
and
the
method
employed
may
be
the
same
as
for
beavers
open
skins
which
have
not
been
fleshed
should
have
all
of
the
flesh
peeled
off
after
they
are
stretched
and
then
it
will
frequently
be
found
necessary
to
them
but
this
is
not
difficult
when
using
the
twine
all
furs
should
be
dried
or
cured
in
a
cool
airy
place
they
should
never
be
allowed
near
the
heat
of
the
fire
as
they
dry
rapidly
and
become
brittle
and
unfit
for
use
in
camp
they
may
be
dried
in
some
corner
removed
from
the
fire
but
they
are
likely
to
take
on
a
dirty
yellow
color
from
the
smoke
and
it
is
better
to
have
a
shelter
for
them
on
the
outside
furs
should
not
be
allowed
to
remain
a
long
time
on
the
boards
as
soon
as
they
are
sufficiently
dry
to
prevent
shrinking
or
wrinkling
they
should
be
removed
the
lynx
and
all
species
and
varieties
of
foxes
should
be
turned
with
the
fur
side
out
as
soon
as
they
become
dry
enough
and
if
the
skin
has
become
too
dry
to
turn
it
may
be
dampened
slightly
on
the
stiffer
parts
by
placing
a
damp
cloth
over
it
a
very
little
will
suffice
and
one
must
be
certain
to
allow
the
skin
to
dry
out
thoroughly
after
turning
it
is
best
to
watch
the
skins
closely
and
not
allow
them
to
become
too
dry
before
turning
some
trappers
turn
the
skins
of
other
animals
but
with
the
exception
of
those
mentioned
it
is
better
to
leave
the
fur
side
in
when
shipping
the
furs
they
should
be
packed
flat
and
bound
tightly
those
having
the
fur
side
out
should
be
kept
separate
from
the
others
so
that
the
fur
will
not
become
greasy
i
sew
the
skins
in
burlap
and
put
a
card
bearing
my
name
and
address
inside
of
the
package
also
tie
two
shipping
tags
on
the
outside
furs
handled
by
the
above
methods
will
always
command
good
prices
and
i
never
have
any
cause
for
complaint
if
i
ship
them
to
reliable
dealers
but
when
furs
are
badly
handled
damaged
in
killing
or
afterwards
or
unprime
one
can
not
expect
the
highest

steel
traps
in
the
preceding
pages
i
have
made
frequent
mention
of
the
newhouse
and
other
brands
of
traps
and
the
work
would
hardly
be
complete
without
a
description
of
these
traps
the
newhouse
traps
were
designed
by
sewell
newhouse
a
resident
of
oneida
new
york
sometime
prior
to
the
year
and
the
first
of
these
famous
traps
were
manufactured
by
the
inventor
in
a
little
blacksmith
shop
all
of
the
work
being
done
by
hand
these
traps
were
traded
to
the
neighboring
indians
and
gradually
became
famous
throughout
the
country
early
in
the
fifties
newhouse
moved
to
kenwood
in
madison
county
and
established
a
larger
shop
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
joined
the
oneida
community
and
as
the
demand
for
the
goods
soon
exceeded
the
output
the
firm
decided
that
the
business
must
be
enlarged
and
accordingly
a
small
factory
was
erected
the
business
proved
prosperous
and
it
was
found
necessary
to
enlarge
the
plant
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
increase
the
output
and
supply
the
demand
which
was
increasing
rapidly
as
the
traps
became
well
known
and
today
these
people
are
the
largest
manufacturers
of
steel
traps
in
the
world
great
care
is
used
in
the
tempering
of
the
springs
and
it
is
a
fact
well
known
to
the
users
of
this
goods
that
the
newhouse
spring
is
more
reliable
and
more
durable
than
any
other
the
nearly
perfect
state
of
the
newhouse
trap
as
it
is
made
at
present
has
only
been
reached
after
years
of
study
and
experiment
and
many
of
the
improvements
have
been
brought
about
by
the
trappers
themselves
with
whom
this
firm
has
a
large
correspondence
they
are
always
pleased
to
receive
any
suggestions
for
the
improvement
of
their
traps
although
the
newhouse
is
a
cheap
trap
quality
considered
it
was
soon
found
necessary
to
manufacture
a
line
of
cheaper
traps
and
several
styles
were
placed
on
the
market
these
were
remodeled
and
changed
in
various
ways
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
consumer
and
the
names
were
changed
with
the
style
those
made
at
present
are
known
as
the
hawley
norton
the
oneida
jump
and
the
victor
the
hawley
norton
is
made
in
the
same
style
as
the
newhouse
but
is
lighter
the
victor
is
also
made
in
this
style
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
it
is
the
most
popular
trap
on
the
market
more
of
them
are
used
than
of
any
other
brand
and
being
so
cheap
they
are
especially
liked
by
the
beginner
and
by
those
who
do
not
make
trapping
their
leading
occupation
in
thickly
settled
districts
where
traps
are
often
taken
by
thieves
many
trappers
prefer
to
use
these
cheaper
grades
of
traps
the
oneida
jump
trap
is
a
distinct
departure
from
the
newhouse
pattern
it
is
a
high
grade
trap
but
very
light
and
its
shape
allows
it
to
be
placed
where
an
ordinary
trap
could
be
set
only
with
difficulty
instead
of
having
the
long
bow
spring
as
in
the
other
styles
it
has
a
short
spring
located
inside
of
the
jaws
and
under
the
pan
and
it
is
attached
to
one
end
of
the
bed
plate
of
the
trap
this
makes
the
trap
very
compact
and
it
takes
up
very
little
room
either
when
set
or
sprung
the
traps
have
been
on
the
market
a
comparatively
short
time
but
they
have
already
become
quite
popular
all
of
these
traps
are
made
in
sizes
from
no
to
no
and
the
newhouse
is
made
in
additional
sizes
and
in
special
styles
as
described
in
the
following
pages

for

little
animal

is
very
troublesome
to
western
farmers
and
also
rats
and
other
vermin

numbers
than
any
other

its
use
is
well
understood
by
professional
trappers
and
it
is
the
most
serviceable
size
for
catching
skunks

and
such
other
animals
as

free
themselves
from
traps

gnawing
their
legs
off

various
forms
of

have
been
experimented
with
to
obviate

difficulty
the

proved
very
successful
in
this
respect
