a
review

the

by
theodore
eaton
introduction
in
trying
to
determine
the
ancestral
relationships
of
modern
orders
of
amphibia
it
is
not
possible
to
select
satisfactory
structural
ancestors
among
a
wealth
of
fossils
since
very
few
of
the
known
fossils
could
even
be
considered
possible
and
scarcely
any
are
satisfactory
for
such
a
selection
the
nearest
approach
thus
far
to
a
solution
of
the
problem
in
this
manner
has
been
made
with
reference
to
the
anura
watson
paper
with
certain
modifications
made
necessary
by
gregory
provides
the
paleontological
evidence
so
far
available
on
the
origin
of
frogs
it
shows
that
several
features
of
the
skeleton
of
frogs
such
as
the
enlargement
of
the
interpterygoid
spaces
and
orbits
reduction
of
the
more
posterior
dermal
bones
of
the
skull
and
downward
spread
of
the
neural
arches
lateral
to
the
notochord
were
already
apparent
in
the
pennsylvanian
fig
with
which
gregory
synonymized
and
but
between
the
pennsylvanian
and
the
triassic
the
age
of
the
earliest
known
frog
there
was
a
great
lapse
of
time
and
that
which
passed
between
any
conceivable
paleozoic
ancestor
of
urodela
and
the
earliest
satisfactory
representative
of
this
order
in
the
cretaceous
was
much
longer
still
the
apoda
so
far
as
known
have
no
fossil
record
nevertheless
it
should
be
possible
first
to
survey
those
characters
of
modern
amphibia
that
might
afford
some
comparison
with
the
early
fossils
and
second
to
discover
among
the
known
paleozoic
kinds
those
which
are
sufficiently
unspecialized
to
permit
derivation
of
the
modern
patterns
further
circumstantial
evidence
may
be
obtained
by
examining
some
features
of
recent
amphibia
which
could
not
readily
be
compared
with
anything
in
the
fossils
such
are
the
embryonic
development
of
the
soft
structures
including
cartilaginous
stages
of
the
skeleton
the
development
and
various
specializations
of
the
ear
mechanism
adaptive
characters
associated
with
aquatic
and
terrestrial
life
and
so

of
modern
orders

labyrinthodonts
and

in

flat
with

pterygoids
that
diverge

from

with
large

these
statements
do
not
apply
to
certain
larval
or
perennibranchiate
forms
the
skull
in
both
orders
has
lost
a
number
of
primitive
dermal
bones

these
are

but
there
are
no

the

nerves
since
these
are
not
separate
in
modern
amphibia
the
opisthotic
is
missing
in
all
except
proteidae
but
see
discussion
of
the
ear
although
the
skull
is
normally
autostylic
a
movable
basipterygoid
articulation
is
present
among
hynobiid
salamanders
and
in
at
least
the
metamorphic
stages
of
primitive
frogs
and
therefore
should
be
expected
in
their
ancestors
the
vertebrae
are
of
course
complete
see
discussion
in
later
section
the
quadratojugal
lost
in
salamanders
is
retained
in
frogs
and
conversely
the
lacrimal
absent
in
frogs
occurs
in
a
few
primitive
salamanders
the
situation
in
apoda
is
different
but
postfrontal
and
jugal
should
be
noted
as
bones
retained
in
this
order
while
lost
in
the
others
thus
in
spite
of
minor
differences
the
above
list
shows
that
there
are
numerous
and
detailed
similarities
between
anura
and
urodela
with
respect
to
the
features
in
which
they
differ
from
the
paleozoic
orders
pusey
listed
characters
which
shares
with
salamanders
but
not
with
more
advanced
frogs
a
few
of
these
might
be
coincidental
but
most
of
them
are
of
some
complexity
and
must
be
taken
to
indicate
relationship

main
adaptive
specializations
of
anura

including
loss
of
the

extreme
reduction
in

of
vertebrae
formation
of
urostyle
elongation
of
the
ilium
and
lengthening
of

legs
must
have
appeared
at
a
later
time
than
the
separation
of
that
order
from
any
possible
common
stem
with
urodela
although
they
are
only
partially
developed
in
the
triassic
turning
to
the
paleozoic
amphibia
there
are
two
groups
in
which
some
likelihood
of
a
relationship
with
modern
order
exists
in
the
pennsylvanian
trimerorhachoidea
labyrinthodontia
order
temnospondyli
some
members
such
as

notably

not

of
the
more
posterior

of
watson

that
these
animals
make
quite
suitable
structural
ancestors
of
frogs
romer
placed
in
an
order
eoanura
but
gregory
indicated
that
it
might
better
be
left
with
the
temnospondyls
association
of
the
urodele
stem
with
this
group
does
not
seem
to
have
been
proposed
hitherto
the
other
group
of
paleozoic
amphibia
that
has
been
considered
probably
ancestral
to
any
modern
type
is
the
subclass
lepospondyli
containing
three
orders
aistopoda
nectridia
and
microsauria
in
these
the
vertebrae
are
complete
holospondylous
the
centra
presumably
formed
by
cylindrical
ossification
around
the
notochord
and
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
the
contributions
from
embryonic
cartilage
units
it
is
important
to
note
at
this
point
that
precisely
the
same
statement
can
be
made
regarding
the
vertebrae
of
of
all
three
recent
orders
yet
for
all
of
them
as
shown
in
a
later
section
we
have
ample
evidence
of
the
part
played
by
cartilage
elements
in
vertebral
development
therefore
a
we
can
not
say
that
there
were
no
such
elements
in
embryonic
stages
of
lepospondyls
and
b
it
would
take
more
than
the
evidence
from
adult
vertebrae
to
relate
a
particular
modern
order
for
example
urodela
to
the
lepospondyli
vague
similarities
to
urodela
have
been
noted
by
many
authors
in
the
nectridia
aistopoda
and
microsauria
but
these
are
not
detailed
and
refer
mainly
to
the
vertebrae
the
skulls
do
not
show
either
dorsally
or
in
the
palate
any
striking
resemblance
to
those
of
generalized
salamanders
and
certainly
most
known
lepospondyls
are
too
specialized
to
serve
as
the
source
of
urodela
it
is
true
that
the
elongate
bodies
small
limbs
and
apparent
aquatic
habitus
of
some
lepospondyls
accord
well
with
our
usual
picture
of
a
salamander
but
such
a
form
and
way
of
life
have
appeared
in
many
early
amphibia
including
the
labyrinthodonts
the
family
lysorophidae
fig
usually
placed
among
microsaurs
is
sufficiently
close
in
skull
structure
to
the
apoda
to
be
a
possible
ancestor
of
these
but
it
probably
has
nothing
to
do
with
urodela
by
reason
of
the
numerous
morphological
specializations
that
were
associated
with
its
snakelike
habitus

suggestion
that
it
would
be
profitable
to
look
among
the
seymouriamorpha
for
the
ancestors
of
frogs
seems
to
be
based
upon
a
few
details
of
apparent
resemblance
rather
than
a
comprehensive
view
of
the
major
characters
of
the
animals
in
most
points

of

the
present
writer
does
not
see
a
closer
similarity
of
frogs
to
seymouriamorpha
than
to
temnospondyli
still
other
opinions
have
been
expressed
herre
for
instance
concludes
on
anatomical
biological
and
paleontological
grounds
that
the
orders
of
urodela
anura
apoda
and
stegocephali
were
all
independently
evolved
from
fish
but
beyond
citing
the
opinions
of
a
number
of
other
authors
he
does
not
present
tangible
evidence
for
this
extreme
polyphyletic
interpretation
more
notable
are
the
views
of
several
scandinavian
workers
jarvik
holmgren
b
of
whom
jarvik
in
a
thorough
analysis
of
the
ethmoid
region
would
derive
the
urodela
from
porolepid
crossopterygii
and
all
other
tetrapods
from
the
rhipidistia
and
holmgren
the
latter
using
the
structure
of
carpus
and
tarsus
see
a
relationship
of
urodela
to
dipnoi
but
accept
the
derivation
of
labyrinthodonts
and
other
tetrapods
from
rhipidistia
all
of
this
work
is
most
detailed
and
laborious
and
has
produced
a
great
quantity
of
data
useful
to
morphologists
but
the
diphyletic
theory
is
not
widely
adopted
the
evidence
adduced
for
it
seems
to
consist
largely
of
minutiae
which
taken
by
themselves
are
inconclusive
or
lend
themselves
to
other
interpretation
for
instance
holmgren
numerous
figures
of
embryonic
limbs
of
salamanders
show
patterns
of
cartilage
elements
that
he
would
trace
to
the
dipnoan
type
of
fin
yet
it
is
difficult
to
see
that
the
weight
of
evidence
requires
this
when
the
pattern
does
not
differ
in
any
fundamental
manner
from
those
seen
in
other
embryonic
tetrapods
and
the
differences
that
do
appear
may
well
be
taken
to
have
ontogenetic
rather
than
phylogenetic
meaning
further
the
dipnoan
specialization
of
dental
plates
and
autostylic
jaw
suspension
already
accomplished
early
in
the
devonian
would
seem
to
exclude
dipnoi
from
possible
ancestry
of
the
urodela

order
unknown
prior
to
the
mesozoic

which
the
teeth
are
essentially
similar

suspension
is

the

passing

this
may
be
primitive
in
the
same
sense
as
the
persistent
opisthotic
there
can
be
of
course
no
question
of
the
nerve
having
worked
its
way
through
or
over
the
obstructing
stapes
in
order
to
come
below
it
in
salamanders
rather
the
peripheral
growth
of

simply
pursue
a
slightly
different
course

contrasting

shows
in

an
operculum
this
is
apparently
a
mistake
the
stapes
has
a
large
footplate
and
its
stylus
articulates
with
the
quadrate
but
no
true
operculum
or
opercularis
has
been
described
in
the
apoda
the
facial
nerve
passes
above
the
stapes
it
does
not
seem
necessary
to
regard
the
conditions
in
this
order
as
related
directly
to
those
of
either
salamanders
or
frogs
but
a
reduction
of
the
stapes
comparable
to
that
in
salamanders
has
occurred
the
presence
in
both
frogs
and
terrestrial
salamanders
of
a
special
mechanism
involving
the
opercularis
muscle
and
an
operculum
cut
out
in
identical
fashion
from
the
wall
of
the
otic
capsule
behind
the
stapes
seems
to
require
some
other
explanation
than
that
of
a
chance
convergence
or
parallelism
although
the
stapes
and
otic
region
are
readily
visible
in
a
number
of
labyrinthodonts
and
lepospondyls
no
indication
of
an
operculum
seems
to
be
reported
among
them
but
in
the
triassic
fig
which
is
unmistakably
a
frog
in
its
skull
pelvis
and
some
other
features
piveteau
has
shown
immediately
behind
the
foot
of
the
stapes
a
small
bony
tubercle
which
he
and
watson
designated
opisthotic
very
clearly
it
served
for
insertion
of
a
muscle
and
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
bone
is
a
reduced
opisthotic
carrying
the
paroccipital
process
already
mentioned
as
characteristic
of
it
in
some
temnospondyls
since
the
remainder
of
the
posterior
wall
of
the
otic
capsule
consists
of
cartilage
meeting
the
exoccipital
it
may
be
that
the
opisthotic
becomes
the
operculum
in
frogs
was
too
far
specialized
in
the
anuran
direction
although
it
still
had
a
tail
and
the
forelegs
and
hind
legs
were
nearly
the
same
size
to
be
considered
a
possible
ancestor
of
the
urodeles
but
at
one
stage
in
the
general
reduction
of
the
skull
in
the
ancestry
of
both
groups
a
condition
similar
to
that
in
may
have
characterized
the
otic
region
long
before
the
triassic
in
the
argument
thus
far
we
have
considered
terrestrial
adult
amphibians
since
it
is
only
in
these
that
either
the
normal
middle
ear
and
tympanum
or
the
opercular
apparatus
is
present
but
among
the
urodeles
several
neotenic
types
occur
this
term
applies
also
to
the
perennibranchs
for
most
of
these
there
is
nothing
about
the
otic
region
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
derivation
by
neoteny
from
known
families
in
which
adults
are
terrestrial
for
example
could
have
had
a
ancestor
but
this
as
mentioned
above
does
not
hold
for
the
proteidae
which
possess
an
opisthotic
of
relatively
large
size
distinctly
separate
from
the
exoccipital
and
prootic
either
this
bone
is
a
neomorph
which
seems
improbable
or
there
has
not
been
in
the
ancestry
of
this
particular
family
an
episode
of
reduction
comparable
to
that
seen
in
the
terrestrial
families
where
there
is
an
operculum
instead
of
a
normal
opisthotic
therefore
the
proteidae
probably
are
not
derived
from
the
general
stem
of
other
salamanders
but
diverged
sufficiently
long
ago
that
the
bones
of
the
otic
region
were
reduced
on
a
different
pattern
they
need
not
be
removed
from
the
order
but
in
this
respect
recognized
as
more
primitive

any

the
pattern
of
vertebral
and
rib
development
is
more
complex
and
there
has
been
much
controversy
over
its
interpretation
neural
arches
and
perichordal
centra
form
in
the
same
manner
as
in
frogs
but
with
the
addition
in
certain
cases
of
a
median
supradorsal
cartilage
which
gives
rise
to
the
zygapophyses
of
each
neural
arch
difficulty
comes
however
in
understanding
the
relationship
of
the
ribs
to
the
vertebrae
each
rib
usually
articulates
with
a
transverse
process
that
in
its
early
development
seems
to
be
separate
from
both
the
vertebra
and
the
rib
and
is
therefore
known
noncommittally
as
this
lies
laterally
from
the
centrum
neural
arch
and
vertebral
artery
upon
fusing
with
the
vertebra
it
therefore
encloses
the
artery
in
a
foramen
separate
from
the
one
between
the
capitulum
and
tuberculum
of
the
rib
the
usual
location
of
the
vertebral
artery
at
least
four
different
interpretations
of
these
structures
have
been
suggested
naef
considered
the
a
derivative
of
the
basiventral
which
by
spreading
laterally
and
dorsally
to
meet
the
neural
arch
enclosed
the
vertebral
artery
he
then
supposed
that
by
reduction
of
the
in
other
tetrapods
frogs
and
amniotes
the
vertebrarterial
foramen
and
costal
foramen
were
brought
together
in
a
single
foramen
transversarium
the
implication
is
that
the
urodele
condition
is
primitive
but
it
can
not
now
be
supposed
that
urodela
are
ancestral
to
any
other
group
and
the
is
most
probably
a
specialization
limited
to
salamanders
this
does
not
of
course
invalidate
the
first
part
of
his
interpretation
remane
noting
that
rib
insertions
of
early
amphibia
are
essentially
as
in
amniota
argued
that
the
is
not
from
the
basiventral
but
is
a
neomorph
which
originates
directly
from
the
neural
arch
and
grows
ventrally
this
he
inferred
mainly
from
gamble
observation
on
but
his
assumption
that
is
more
primitive
than
other
salamanders
such
as
the
salamandridae
where
the
pattern
differs
from
this
is
not
necessarily
correct
rather
the
perennibranchs
are
distinguished
mainly
by
their
neotenous
features
and
their
development
is
likely
to
show
simplifications
which
are
not
necessarily
primitive
the
suggestion
of
a
neomorph
ought
not
to
be
made
except
as
a
last
resort
for
it
is
simply
an
acknowledgment
that
the
author
does
not
recognize
homology
with
any
structure
already
known
sometimes
further
information
will
make
such
recognition
possible
gray
using
concluded
that
the
normal
capitulum
of
the
rib
was
lost
but
that
the
tuberculum
bifurcated
to
make
the
two
heads
seen
in
urodela
thus
accounting
for
the
failure
of
the
costal
foramen
to
coincide
with
that
of
the
vertebral
artery
this
answer
too
seems
to
entail
an
unprovable
assumption
which
should
not
be
made
without
explicit
evidence
finally
emelianov
regarded
the
as
a
rudimentary
rib
on
account
of
its
relationship
to
the
vertebral
artery
and
considered
the
actual
rib
to
be
a
neomorph
in
the
position
characteristic
of
tetrapod
ribs
in
general
this
argument
would
fit
the
ontogenetic
picture
satisfactorily
provided
that
there
were
some
evidence
of
ventral
rather
than
dorsal
ribs
in
early
amphibia
and
we
accept
the
invention
of
another
neomorph
in
modern
amphibia
as
an
unavoidable
necessity
emelianov
conclusion
should
be
quoted
here
translation
the
ribs
of
urodela
are
shown
to
be
upper
ribs
yet
we
find
besides
these
in
urodela
rudimentary
lower
ribs
fused
with
the
vertebral
column
the
ribs
of
apoda
are
lower
ribs
in
anura
ribs
fail
to
develop
fully
but
as
rare
exceptions
rudiments
of
upper
ribs
appear
of
these
various
interpretations
that
of
naef
seems
to
involve
the
minimum
of
novelty
namely
that
the
is
the
basiventral
expanded
and
external
to
the
vertebral
artery
it
is
not
necessary
to
take
this
modification
as
the
ancestral
condition
in
tetrapods
of
course
the
basiventral
would
merely
have
expanded
sufficiently
to
provide
a
diapophysis
for
the
tuberculum
as
well
as
the
primitive
facet
for
the
capitulum
no
neomorph
appears
under
this
hypothesis
which
has
the
distinct
advantage
of
simplicity
figures
of
early
stages
in
vertebral
development
by
the
authors
mentioned
show
that
the
basidorsals
chondrify
first
as
neural
arches
while
a
separate
mass
of
mesenchyme
lies
externally
and
ventrally
from
these
this
mesenchyme
may
chondrify
either
in
one
piece
on
each
side
or
in
two
in
the
part
adjacent
to
the
centrum
is
ossified
in
the
larva
and
subsequently
unites
with
the
more
dorsal
and
lateral
cartilaginous
part
while
the
rib
appearing
farther
out
grows
inward
to
meet
this
composite
in
the
mesenchyme
below
the
neural
arch
differentiates
into
a
cartilage
below
the
vertebral
artery
position
proper
to
a
basiventral
a
bridge
between
this
and
the
neural
arch
and
a
rib
the
latter
two
chondrifying
later
than
the
basiventral
proper
in
the
axolotl
presumably
the
grows
downward
from
its
first
center
of
chondrification
at
the
side
of
the
neural
arch
emelianov
thus
it
appears
that
the
simplest
hypothesis
to
account
for
the
is
that
it
is
the
basiventral
it
is
recognizable
just
before
chondrification
as
a
mass
of
mesenchyme
in
contact
with
both
the
notochordal
sheath
and
the
basidorsal
cartilage
it
may
chondrify
or
ossify
first
in
its
ventral
portion
or
in
its
dorsal
portion
the
two
then
joining
before
it
fuses
with
the
rest
of
the
vertebra
the
enclosure
of
the
vertebral
artery
is
a
consequence
of
the
extension
of
the
basiventral
beyond
the
position
occupied
by
it
in
primitive
amphibia
and
there
is
no
indication
that
this
took
place
in
other
orders
than
the
urodela
it
seems
that
the
vertebrae
in
urodela
have
at
least
the
following
components
perichordal
centra
separate
basidorsal
cartilages
and
basiventrals
which
are
somewhat
specialized
in
their
manner
of
development
the
vertebrae
of
anura
develop
in
the
fashion
just
described
except
that
basiventrals
are
lacking
it
would
seem
no
more
difficult
to
accept
the
derivation
of
salamander
vertebrae
from
the
temnospondylous
type
than
it
is
in
the
case
of
frogs
if
other
evidence

the

closely
similar
to

there
is
no

sternum

it
is
safe
to
suppose
that
some
cartilage
lay
in
the
midline
between
the
clavicles
and
coracoids
but
there
is
no
evidence
as
to
its

overlapping
if
any
apparently
then
there

to
infer

had

again
the

there

the

coracoid
ossification

this

is
evidently
that
shown

direct
comparison
of

three
genera

another
suggests
that
if
we
use
the
term
arciferal
for
any
we
should
use
it
for
all
in
the
remote
predecessor
of
anura
of
the
pennsylvanian
the
pectoral
girdle
was
less
substantial
than
in
many
of
its
contemporaries
but
it
contained
the
primitive
median
interclavicle
in
addition
to
the
clavicle
cleithrum
and
scapulocoracoid
the
figure
of
watson
and
that
by
gregory
are
of
individuals
of
different
ages
the
latter
being
older
it
is
clear
that
the
paired
elements
of
such
a
girdle
were
held
rigid
by
their
attachment
to
the
interclavicle
the
clavicles
subsequent
elimination
of
the
interclavicle
in
the
anuran
line
of
descent
and
decrease
of
ossification
left
a
girdle
like
that

rigid

bones
occur

is
usually
a
scapulocoracoid
ossified
as

a

cartilaginous
suprascapula
extends
dorsally

centers
of

the

of

comparison

fruitless
on
these
points
unless
we
go
back
to
forms
too
distant
to
have
any
special
value
such
as
this
is
because
of
inadequate
preservation
and
because
the
elements
are
not
fully
ossified
in
many
immature
specimens
for
the
purpose
of
this
review
there
is
no
special
value
in
a
comparison
of
the
tarsi
of
frogs
and
salamanders
since
the
leaping
adaptation
of
the
former
leaves
very
little
common
pattern
between
them
even
in
where
the
legs
were
not
yet
conspicuously
lengthened
the
tibiale
and
fibulare
astragalus
and
calcaneum
respectively
were
already
considerably
elongated
the
carpus
and
tarsus
of
are
as
yet
undecipherable
the
larva
considering
the
postembryonic
developmental
stages
of
modern
amphibia
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
larva
of
a
salamander
in
which
lateral
line
pores
and
a
gular
fold
are
present
represents
much
more
closely
the
type
of
larva
found
in
labyrinthodonts
than
does
the
limbless
tadpole
of
the
anura
larvae
of
labyrinthodonts
are
well
known
especially
those
formerly
supposed
to
comprise
the
order
branchiosauria
many
perhaps
the
majority
of
labyrinthodonts
show
some
features
associated
with
aquatic
life
even
when
as
do
the
lepospondyls
these
features
may
include
impressions
of
sensory
canals
on
the
dermal
bones
of
the
skull
persistence
of
visceral
arches
reduction
in
size
of
appendages
and
failure
of
tarsal
and
carpal
elements
to
ossify
in
fact
it
appears
that
very
few
of
the
paleozoic
amphibia
were
successful
in
establishing
themselves
as
terrestrial
animals
even
as
adults
nevertheless
in
the
ancestry
of
anura
and
that
of
at
least
the
hynobiid
ambystomid
salamandrid
and
plethodontid
salamanders
there
must
certainly
have
been
a
terrestrial
adult
transforming
from
an
aquatic
larva
the
leaping
mechanism
of
anura
shown
in
so
many
features
of
their
anatomy
is
perhaps
to
be
explained
as
a
device
for
sudden
escape
from
land
into
the
water
but
it
was
not
yet
perfected
in
the
triassic
or
the
jurassic
the
middle
ear
its
mechanism
and
the
tympanum
well
developed
in
most
anura
are
readily
derived
from
those
of
early
labyrinthodonts
and
are
presumably
effective
for
hearing
airborne
sounds
whether
on
land
or
while
floating
in
the
water
reduction
of
these
organs
in
urodela
may
be
correlated
with
their
customary
restriction
to
subsurface
habitats
and
inability
to
maintain
a
floating
position
while
in
water
some
light
may
be
shed
on
the
significance
of
the
tadpole
of
anura
by
considering
the
early
stages
of
the
ribbed
frogs
liopelmidae
and
are
so
closely
similar
in
the
adult
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
belong
in
one
family
primitive
in
some
respects
including
articulated
ribs
pyriformis
and
caudalipuboischiotibialis
muscles
but
not
in
others

of

and

in

genera

but
in
each
case
terrestrial

are
obvious
this
is
not
true
of
which
stephenson
regards
as
more
nearly
comparable
with
urodela
in
its
development
than
with
other
anura
and
he
sees
in
it
a
primary
and
amphibious
mode
instead
of
a
terrestrial
specialization
the
tadpole
bears
no
outward
resemblance
to
the
larva
of
but
is
a
normal
tadpole
in
form
although
sluggish
in
activity
its
greatly
expanded
labial
folds
bear
numerous
rows
of
horny
epidermal
teeth

with
the

serve
to
anchor
the
tadpole

noble
noticed
that
particles
of
food
were
taken
in
through
the
external
nares
and
that
a
current
of
water
passed
through
these
openings
and
out
by
way
of
the
median
spiracle
it
appears
that
any
action
by
the
teeth
and
jaws
in
scraping
algae
from
the
rocks
which
were
bare
in
the
stream
where
i
have
collected
would
be
quite
incidental
and
that
the
lips
and
teeth
must
be
primarily
a
clinging
mechanism
certain
other
mountain
brook
tadpoles
for
example
show
similar
devices
but
these
are
developed
independently
as
specializations
from
the
usual
sort
of
tadpole
may
it
not
be
that
closure
of
the

the
opercular

retardation
of

development
expansion
of
the
lips
growth
of
parallel
rows
of
horny
teeth
and
other
correlated
features
that
make
a
tadpole
were
brought
about
as
an
adaptation
of
the
primitive
anuran
larva
to
a
habitat
and
that
this
basic
patent
then
later
served
to
admit
the
tadpoles
of
descendant
types
to
an
habit
in
quiet
water
as
well
the
tadpole
as
a
unique
larval
type
among
vertebrates
bears
the
hallmarks
of
an
abrupt
adaptive
shift
such
as
might
have
occurred
within
the
limits
of
a
single
family
and
it
seems
difficult
to
imagine
the
enclosed
branchial
chamber
the
and
lips
of
a
familiar
tadpole
as
having
evolved
without
some
kind
of
suctorial
function
along
the
way
summary
the
anura
probably
originated
among
temnospondylous
labyrinthodonts
through
a
line
represented
approximately
by
and
the
triassic
frog
as
shown
by
watson
piveteau
and
others
the
known
paleozoic
lepospondyls
do
not
show
clear
indications
of
a
relationship
with
urodela
but
may
well
be
on
the
ancestral
stem
of
the
apoda
between
urodela
and
anura
there
are
numerous
resemblances
which
seem
to
indicate
direct
relationship
through
a
common
stock
a
similar
reduction
of
dermal
bones
of
the
